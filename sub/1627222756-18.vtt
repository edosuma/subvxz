00:02.252 --> 00:05.672
<i>We've come so far.
Lost so much.</i>

00:05.672 --> 00:07.298
<i>Saying you handcuffed
my brother to a roof</i>

00:07.382 --> 00:08.508
<i>and you left him there?</i>

00:08.508 --> 00:11.011
<i>It's hard to trust
when anyone could go at any time.</i>

00:12.846 --> 00:17.642
<i>But the people who die and the
people who go aren't lost forever.</i>

00:19.060 --> 00:21.855
<i>I believe that. I have to.</i>

00:23.648 --> 00:25.692
<i>- And remembering their voices...</i>
- <i>These people need you.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:27.360
<i>...is how we keep them alive.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:30.196
<i>The future belongs
to all of us now.</i>

00:30.572 --> 00:32.532
TROOPER 1: Drop your weapon!
Hold it right there!

00:33.825 --> 00:36.327
- TROOPER 2: Take this guy out!
- TROOPER 1: Put the knife down!

00:36.453 --> 00:39.998
- TROOPER 2: Do it, or we will shoot!
- Let him go! Now!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.169
Everyone, stand down!

01:02.395 --> 01:04.856
You heard him. Lower your weapon.

01:07.692 --> 01:11.112
This is not just about you.
I need him alive.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.826
Dixon. Not here.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.997
- Not like this.
- You choosing this piece of shit?

01:21.790 --> 01:25.502
- If I was, you'd already be down.
- Do what you fucking gotta do.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.170
Daryl.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.176
- What have you done?
- I made a deal for us.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.587
Don't worry. He'll live.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.066
So,
the slate's just wiped clean?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.945
Debt, deaths on both sides.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.365
We get supplies, water, weapons.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.410
Pamela provides everything
that we need to finish rebuilding.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.747
- Free and clear.
- Then we just go home?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.250
That's up to everyone to decide.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.671
- What does Pamela get out of this?
- Hornsby.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.883
We tell the people
what he did out here,

03:37.300 --> 03:40.303
back at that house where folks died.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.516
- He takes the fall for it.
- So this is about saving her son.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.602
It's not our problem anymore.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.773
We'll talk about it with our people
when they get here.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.983
There's a lot to think about
on our end.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.320
Right. Yeah. Like how
they killed most of our people.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.867
Anybody else?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.666
I think the most important thing
is that we're together.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.502
I don't want to go it alone anymore.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.340
I don't trust them. But if you say
that this deal gets us back

04:17.465 --> 04:21.386
in our homes with our own rules,
then I think it's worth the risk.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.226
All right.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.407
You mind shifting me over
a few feet?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.994
I think I'm stuck
on an anthill here.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.586
Get used to it.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.046
Wow.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.257
I always thought
we got along so well.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.010
How many of my men
have you gotten killed?

05:02.427 --> 05:06.222
Oh, Mercer.
I thought you realized by now.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.142
They're not your men.

05:19.277 --> 05:20.695
Better hop to it, soldier.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.762
You'll be transported back to
the Commonwealth and put on trial.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.598
Look, Pamela, it's just
the two of us. Drop the act.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.267
No act, Lance. You've gone too far.

05:53.728 --> 05:54.771
Seriously?

05:56.189 --> 05:59.067
You never seemed to have a problem
with how I got the job done before.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.527
We're not talking about the past.
Only now.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.155
And you've made quite a mess of now.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.281
Hold on.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.241
You might survive this
if you play things right.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.744
But your life
at the Commonwealth is over.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.287
Over?

06:14.165 --> 06:18.002
After all the years, after all that
I've done in service of you...

06:18.086 --> 06:21.923
Oh, please. You served yourself
above everything and anyone else.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.301
Always trying so hard
to prove the world wrong.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.055
You refuse to see it,
but I've made something of myself.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.149
You're an angry,
delusional little boy, Lance.

06:40.983 --> 06:45.238
Trying to win a game,
but too foolish to realize

06:45.238 --> 06:48.449
that you've never actually
been a player in it.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.209
You still need me.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.048
If something happens to me,

07:05.299 --> 07:07.260
certain alliances
the Commonwealth has,

07:08.010 --> 07:11.806
certain stabilizing factors,
are likely to become a problem.

07:16.894 --> 07:20.731
Whatever game you're playing,
Pamela, I'm very much in it.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.363
Lance Hornsby abused his position

07:27.447 --> 07:29.532
and caused untold suffering
for others.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.911
But thanks in part to the assistance
of friends and allies,

07:33.995 --> 07:36.038
along with our
dedicated armed forces,

07:36.622 --> 07:38.166
he was unable to escape.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.753
And I promise you all,
justice will be served.

07:47.675 --> 07:48.968
She played that perfectly.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.054
Hornsby takes the fall,
Sebastian skates.

07:52.138 --> 07:54.599
Now, tomorrow is Founders' Day,

07:54.807 --> 07:58.478
an opportunity for our community
to come together and celebrate

07:59.020 --> 08:04.066
what truly makes
the Commonwealth great, its people.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.652
And we will celebrate.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.114
We will not forget,
but we will rise above this.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.451
Because we are the Commonwealth.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.173
There has to be
something more we can do.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.886
Your people are leaving.
It's not your problem anymore.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.264
Hey, I'm still standing here.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.934
I know. Thank you.

08:38.768 --> 08:43.022
Would you ever consider
a change of scenery?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.067
You showed me your home.
I could show you mine.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.071
Maybe someday.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.495
But not yet.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.137
Now we'll make sure
Oceanside is okay.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.599
I'll fill Cyndie and Rachel
in on the plan, see what they need.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.893
It'll take a bit
to get everybody ready

09:21.644 --> 09:23.104
and gather up all the supplies.

09:24.313 --> 09:27.108
Head to Alexandria first.
It's in better shape than Hilltop.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.818
- We'll see you there.
- Be safe.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.365
- Sure you wanna go?
- Yeah, it's fine.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.660
Been on the road a few weeks,
so what's a few more, right?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.081
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.251
Pack's all set.
I'll grab us some water, okay?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.669
All right. Thank you.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.716
"What's a few more weeks," huh?

09:53.217 --> 09:55.595
- Sorry.
- You don't have to be sorry.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.180
No, I just...

10:00.641 --> 10:01.809
Henry.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.062
You know,
I haven't forgotten about him.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.690
It's just... I don't know.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.320
You take happiness
wherever you can get it.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.574
And don't ever be sorry for it.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.201
Yeah?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.205
Yeah.

10:28.669 --> 10:32.965
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

10:34.008 --> 10:39.472
- I never thanked you for saving her.
- I never thanked you for saving me.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.601
- We don't have to. We just do it.
- Yeah.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.731
All right. Come on.
Be safe out there, all right?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.317
You too.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.784
We'll be back before you know it.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.125
It's okay.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.220
Here. It's yours.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.396
I don't want it.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.904
All right.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.620
My mom talked about the day
she'd hang up her sword for good.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.123
Not that we'd be completely safe,

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
but enough to feel like
she didn't need it anymore.

11:51.377 --> 11:53.379
If I keep that, things go back
to how they were.

11:54.130 --> 11:58.134
- But they should be better.
- They will be once we get home.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.220
How? It's still broken.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.850
And what about everyone else here?
Shouldn't we stay and help them?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.645
Isn't that what you and Mom and Dad
did at Alexandria and Hilltop?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.148
- That was different.
- It wasn't.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.774
The only difference now

12:13.858 --> 12:15.192
is that you'd rather
run away than stay and fight.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.361
God damn it. Stop.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.448
Stop.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.368
Just stop.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.865
Lottery tickets here!
Get your lottery tickets here!

13:03.616 --> 13:06.827
A new life for the price of a buck.
Lottery!

13:15.711 --> 13:18.380
You know, you don't have to
lug that thing around anymore.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.176
Yeah, well, I hate to
disappoint the kids.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.721
- I'm sure somebody else could do it.
- Enh.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.475
Maybe I just enjoy the exercise.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.981
You're not coming, are you?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.903
If it's about the treatment,
we'll have plenty of medicine.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.905
I made sure of it.
Maybe Tomi can come.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.114
It's not that.

13:48.786 --> 13:49.829
My place is here.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.291
When I set out with
Eugene and Yumiko,

13:54.375 --> 13:57.378
we were all desperate for help.
Remember?

14:00.339 --> 14:04.593
And I was desperate
to make a difference, one last time.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.473
But this place, these people,

14:12.351 --> 14:13.477
you,

14:14.979 --> 14:17.731
gave me a second chance
to do a whole lot more.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.024
So that's what I'm gonna do.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.660
Helping the people of another
Kingdom before it falls apart.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.416
Hey, come on down.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.835
Sure. Let's try it. Okay.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.674
We could all do that.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.347
<i>Today is a day of remembrance,</i>

14:50.431 --> 14:51.974
<i>of those whose lives were lost</i>

14:51.974 --> 14:53.934
<i>in the founding
of this Commonwealth.</i>

14:54.268 --> 14:57.062
<i>Their courage
and grit fortify our walls,</i>

14:57.229 --> 15:01.108
<i>protecting our families, the future,
and America itself.</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:05.154
If they'll hear this,
why do I have to give a speech?

15:08.365 --> 15:10.117
There are certain things
you need to do

15:10.117 --> 15:12.036
if you're ever going to
lead this place.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.623
Max, could you...

15:23.005 --> 15:26.258
"It is an absolute privilege
to be with you here today

15:26.342 --> 15:29.678
"as we honor the founding
of our great home."

15:30.596 --> 15:31.847
Wow.

15:31.931 --> 15:37.603
That is crap. I don't need this.
I will lead because I'm a Milton.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.605
You have jeopardized enough
with your stupidity.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.399
They need to see that
you have nothing to hide,

15:42.483 --> 15:45.194
and be reminded
that you are his grandson.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.781
- I am.
- Then show them. Show me.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.459
- I will.
- I know you will.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.546
Politics was not
my first choice either.

16:11.595 --> 16:13.764
You were born to lead this place.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.530
Hmm.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.699
It looks like your amniotic fluid
is a little high.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.661
- What does that mean?
- That you're in the right place.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.956
It might have been an issue
if we didn't catch it earlier,

16:39.623 --> 16:41.709
but now we'll keep a close eye
and you'll be fine.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.349
- This all getting too real for you?
- No.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.227
No.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.189
- But it is real.
- It's all gonna be fine.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.033
- Staying here isn't an option.
- Yeah.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.577
It's not.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.750
There are people looking to us.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.172
I can't risk them. I won't.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.509
You know, I keep hearing
my dad's voice inside my head,

17:34.887 --> 17:39.892
saying, "Your life is not your own
once you have kids.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.143
"It's never the same."

17:44.480 --> 17:49.443
I always just wanted to know what
that meant. And I finally get to.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.199
And I keep hearing Ian and Jessie.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.077
And all the people they killed.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.163
We don't need this place.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.585
Because it's us now.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.130
Yeah.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.436
All right. Where's Judith?

19:08.230 --> 19:11.775
- R.J., where's Judith?
- I'm not supposed to say.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.694
She's supposed to be packing.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.365
I said we had to pack,
but she said she wasn't coming.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.035
Where'd she go?

19:25.038 --> 19:26.123
I don't know.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.094
We'll find her.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.057
This parenting thing,
I ain't very good at it.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.476
Well, it's who you are to her now.

19:48.145 --> 19:52.482
- What would he do?
- Don't. Rick is not here. You are.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.487
It's weird, suddenly being a parent.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.908
When Sophia was born,
I had no idea what I was doing.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.035
All I really knew
was that I loved her.

20:04.953 --> 20:08.498
So tiny.
Looking to me for everything.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.212
The weight of making a decision
that would make all the difference.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.885
We just hope that the choice we make
is the right one at the time.

20:20.510 --> 20:22.179
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

20:22.888 --> 20:23.931
Yeah.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.696
- I'm not sure this is the best idea.
- We don't have much of a choice.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.324
- Of course we do.
- Eugene, I have to do something.

20:42.866 --> 20:44.409
I have been in her office for years.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.578
Even if I didn't know
what was really going on,

20:46.662 --> 20:49.665
I definitely knew Sebastian was bad
news, and I just went along with it.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.292
You don't know what it's like
to feel that kind of guilt.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.922
You'd be surprised. I'm fairly
familiar with guilt's burden.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.592
I was proud of what we did.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.972
I got used to feeling like maybe
everything would always be the same.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.140
Like we were trapped
in the old world.

21:08.725 --> 21:12.312
After all this, why shouldn't
we try for something better?

21:12.562 --> 21:14.773
And thinking like that
actually felt good.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.693
Like maybe we could
actually change things.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.197
But it's all being erased.

21:23.699 --> 21:27.160
So I have to try,
no matter what happens.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.539
But if you don't want to do this,
if if this is too much...

21:30.539 --> 21:35.377
I want us to be safe.
We cannot trust this man.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.300
But if you truly believe there's
an outside chance he can help us,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.260
then I'll suck it up.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.096
And I'll do my best.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.945
- I thought you'd be gone by now.
- Not quite.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.079
Sustenance for conversation.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.343
This for all the times
I got you out of a cell?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.847
I'm a mite surprised you're not able
to do the same for yourself.

22:29.681 --> 22:30.766
Who says I'm not?

22:33.393 --> 22:35.228
I try not to take
these things personally.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.983
- That's the game, right?
- Any assistance I could offer?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.196
That's a weak play, Eugene.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.242
You want something, ask for it.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.461
I'm looking for any information
that might be damaging

22:59.753 --> 23:01.421
to Pamela or her progeny.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.008
Hmm.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.221
That's a tough one.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.142
I'd love to help.

23:15.811 --> 23:19.981
But the irony is, Pamela's probably
the only reason I'm alive.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.858
Some friendly advice?

23:22.734 --> 23:25.404
You go after the Miltons,
they'll crush you.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.699
Pamela is just better.
People wanted her son's head.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.869
Now they're dancing in the streets,
celebrating the Milton legacy.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.331
Founders of the Commonwealth.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.671
So trust me when
I say you're better off

23:42.671 --> 23:46.174
making nice with Pamela
and her sadistic shit of a son.

23:53.890 --> 23:57.185
Eugene, make sure
you tell your girlfriend too.

23:58.311 --> 24:02.315
She's so great at hiding in
plain sight, right next to Pamela.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.942
She should keep it up.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.070
The last thing I want is you two
to end up in a cell like mine.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.995
You both have to live with it.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.041
Unless you're willing to burn
the whole thing down.

24:24.421 --> 24:29.092
"You shall do to them
according to the whole commandment

24:29.176 --> 24:30.552
"that I have commanded you.

24:33.096 --> 24:36.266
"Be strong and courageous.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.313
"Do not fear,
or be in dread of them...

24:43.356 --> 24:46.359
"...for it is the Lord
your God who goes with you.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.824
"He will not leave you
or forsake you."

24:56.786 --> 25:00.290
- My last sermon.
- Not your last.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.135
- Come on.
- You all packed?

25:14.721 --> 25:18.683
- Anything here you want me to grab?
- My parishioners brought me food.

25:20.393 --> 25:23.563
We can enjoy Mrs. Brennan's ambrosia
on the road back home.

25:23.688 --> 25:24.731
That's all you.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.950
You know,
I didn't think I'd get back to this.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.745
To him.

25:41.957 --> 25:42.999
But I did.

25:46.002 --> 25:50.924
The people that sit in these pews,
they gave that to me.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.178
You gave them something too,
you know.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.725
And what you gave will be here
long after you're gone.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.062
Yeah.

26:10.026 --> 26:11.861
I just wish they brought
cotton candy instead.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.127
Same thing every year.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.296
We set it up, take it all down,

26:29.296 --> 26:31.256
and we don't even get
to see the main event.

26:32.465 --> 26:36.636
Don't matter, as long as I can hear
those lottery numbers being called.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.180
I promise to forget
all about you when I win.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.062
Can we help you?

27:44.329 --> 27:47.207
- I wasn't trying to worry you.
- I know.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.504
- I just...
- You just wanted to be alone.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.215
I get it.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.301
I used to have a spot like this.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.721
When I wanted to hide
and not go home.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.104
- Where'd you go?
- There was a river behind my house.

28:11.690 --> 28:16.069
I used to go down there,
and wait for my dad to go to sleep.

28:21.866 --> 28:22.951
You were alone a lot?

28:25.954 --> 28:29.582
- Yeah.
- I don't mind being alone.

28:31.042 --> 28:35.046
- Sometimes I like it better.
- Gives you time to think.

28:38.466 --> 28:39.801
Figure things out, I guess.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.898
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- It's okay.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.907
I don't know what I'm doing.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.954
But I'm trying really hard.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.337
I wish things were like
how you want them to be.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.885
That's the way they should be.
But they aren't.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.222
And I have to keep you safe.

29:28.725 --> 29:32.729
I'm gonna hold on to the gun
for a while, till you want it.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.647
Or not.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.693
But either way,
you're stuck with me.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.204
- We good?
- We're good.

29:53.666 --> 29:55.293
Will I get to say bye to my friends?

29:56.461 --> 29:58.546
Yeah. Help me up.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.761
"It's an absolute
privilege to be with you here today,

30:04.761 --> 30:07.847
"as we honor the founding
of our great home."

30:08.056 --> 30:11.392
- I sound like a douchebag!
- You'll be great.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.857
This is for later,
and I'm heading home to change.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.484
Okay. Sounds good.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.320
This is bullshit!

30:35.625 --> 30:37.752
"It is an absolute..."

31:02.902 --> 31:03.945
Hey.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.283
Thanks.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.370
You gonna do it?

31:13.746 --> 31:15.373
I don't think
I have much of a choice.

31:16.499 --> 31:20.420
- You do. We all do.
- Not according to my mom.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.967
It should be my brother.

31:27.594 --> 31:31.389
That's the one she wanted.
I'm just the one that's still here.

31:33.766 --> 31:34.976
You could be more than that.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.605
Is that what this is?
You're just her lackey.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.274
Getting me to do
whatever she wants, right?

31:41.983 --> 31:45.111
I don't just work for your mom.
I'm a citizen.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.530
Okay.

31:47.614 --> 31:50.700
Leading isn't just telling people
her words.

31:52.368 --> 31:56.497
Some truth might be the way to go.
People respect that sort of thing.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.791
People don't want honesty.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.336
They want to be told
that everything's A-okay

32:01.461 --> 32:04.464
so they can go about ignoring the
goddamn mess this world really is.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.757
That's not true.

32:05.965 --> 32:10.595
Please. The Commonwealth
is built on buying into bullshit.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.765
The desperate need to believe

32:13.765 --> 32:15.808
that the old American dream
is still real.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.979
You know, "Anything is possible."
"We could rise above our station."

32:20.605 --> 32:22.023
It's a frigging joke.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.068
The reality is that
the poor stay poor

32:25.068 --> 32:27.779
so that the rich can do
whatever the hell we want.

32:28.738 --> 32:32.116
The game is rigged.
There are no bootstraps to pull up.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.994
Christ, my mom handpicks
the lottery winners.

32:35.578 --> 32:38.748
And none of it matters,
and nothing will ever change.

32:38.998 --> 32:44.045
But those people
that you think want honesty...

32:46.673 --> 32:50.677
Yeah, they're just too stupid
to see it. It's pathetic.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.805
Now that sounded like
you believed it.

32:58.643 --> 33:04.816
But maybe... Maybe you just choose
to be a spoiled asshole.

33:06.776 --> 33:12.615
I mean, if everyone else expects it,
who's left to disappoint?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.222
Yeah. Go have fun.

33:41.436 --> 33:42.478
Nice work.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.773
Lottery tickets here.
Lottery tickets here.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.525
Everyone needs a chance.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.455
You doing all right?

34:00.955 --> 34:03.374
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- I'll be fine.

34:03.583 --> 34:10.590
<i>...please take your seats,
as the main event is about to begin!</i>

34:23.895 --> 34:25.188
That's our president!

34:33.821 --> 34:39.827
<i>People of the Commonwealth,
are you ready to witness</i>

34:39.911 --> 34:45.374
<i>a battle for the ages?</i>

35:09.524 --> 35:10.942
Captain, watch out!

35:17.365 --> 35:19.033
Yeah! All right!

35:23.371 --> 35:24.664
Oh, my God.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.290
Hup, hup!

35:31.379 --> 35:33.256
One, two, three!

35:35.258 --> 35:38.678
Ha! Ha!

35:41.013 --> 35:44.725
Ah! Ha! Ha!

35:45.726 --> 35:48.437
Commonwealth! Commonwealth!

35:48.938 --> 35:50.523
Ha!

35:50.523 --> 35:54.402
- Let me hear it! Come on!
- Commonwealth! Commonwealth!

35:54.986 --> 35:57.572
Commonwealth!
Commonwealth!

36:14.922 --> 36:18.342
<i>Let's extend a hearty thank you
to our combatants!</i>

36:25.016 --> 36:27.894
<i>And now to continue
with this wonderful day,</i>

36:28.436 --> 36:32.023
<i>my son Sebastian
has prepared a few words.</i>

36:49.040 --> 36:52.210
<i>Thank you.
It is an honor and a privilege</i>

36:52.210 --> 36:56.088
<i>to be here with you today
to celebrate the...</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:02.720
- MAN 1: What's he doing?
- MAN 2: Come on.

37:07.600 --> 37:13.064
<i>I know that a lot of you
don't think very well of me.</i>

37:14.815 --> 37:16.359
<i>I know that I probably deserve that.</i>

37:17.610 --> 37:20.529
<i>Now, it is gonna take
a long, long road</i>

37:20.613 --> 37:25.534
<i>for me to earn your trust
and live up to my legacy.</i>

37:27.411 --> 37:31.374
<i>I don't have the words to describe
what this place means to me.</i>

37:33.626 --> 37:34.919
<i>But my grandfather did.</i>

37:35.962 --> 37:41.425
<i>So, humbly, if you would join me
in listening to the wise words</i>

37:42.260 --> 37:46.389
<i>of President Milton,
founder of the Commonwealth.</i>

38:04.240 --> 38:06.075
<i>Please.</i>

38:06.075 --> 38:08.703
<i>The Commonwealth
is built on buying into bullshit.</i>

38:10.579 --> 38:12.039
<i>The desperate need to believe</i>

38:12.123 --> 38:14.125
<i>that the old American dream

38:14.333 --> 38:18.629
<i>You know, "Anything is possible."

<i>- And none of it matters...</i>
- I knew it. I told you.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.981
<i>...and nothing will ever change.</i>

38:36.981 --> 38:38.190
Bitch!

38:40.526 --> 38:41.610
Stop that tape.

38:41.736 --> 38:42.987
- Hold on.
- Go!

38:44.697 --> 38:46.949
<i>Yeah,
they're just too stupid to see it.</i>

38:48.242 --> 38:49.285
Hey.

38:53.331 --> 38:57.668
- Converge on the ring.
<i>- Please, everyone, remain calm.</i>

39:00.546 --> 39:03.007
No one fires their weapons.

39:03.007 --> 39:06.093
Stand down! Stand down!

39:42.213 --> 39:43.839
<i>There are no bootstraps to pull up.</i>

39:43.923 --> 39:46.509
<i>Christ, my mom handpicks
the lottery winners...</i>

39:56.102 --> 40:00.731
Back it up! Back up now!
Get back! Back!

40:11.242 --> 40:12.785
WOMAN 2: Walkers! Run!

40:13.119 --> 40:14.995
Rotters!
We got rotters in the square!

40:22.461 --> 40:25.506
Come back here. You are dead!

40:38.018 --> 40:40.396
Tango. Tango. Tango.
All units to the square.

40:41.063 --> 40:45.234
The dead are inside the walls.
You six, come with me.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.154
Secure the governor
until you hear directly from me.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.157
Where are you going?
You're supposed to protect me.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.535
My job is to protect
the Commonwealth, ma'am.

41:28.402 --> 41:29.445
Judith!

41:33.282 --> 41:34.366
Judith!

42:03.896 --> 42:06.190
- Come on. Let's go.
- Give me the gun.

42:06.982 --> 42:08.025
They need our help.

42:12.821 --> 42:15.783
We'll do this together, all right?
Come on.

42:42.518 --> 42:46.355
Stupid bitch! You're nothing!

43:07.167 --> 43:09.753
Help! Help me!

43:10.504 --> 43:11.797
Help me!

43:12.298 --> 43:14.633
- No!
- We need to go.

43:14.758 --> 43:15.843
Help!

43:17.428 --> 43:21.307
No! Help! Help me!

43:24.810 --> 43:27.146
Help me! Help me!

43:28.564 --> 43:32.318
Help me! Help! Help me!

43:58.135 --> 44:00.137
<i>Yeah,
they're just too stupid to see it.</i>

44:01.305 --> 44:05.851
<i>Please. The Commonwealth

44:07.686 --> 44:08.979
