WEBVTT

00:15.306 --> 00:17.392
I found it on a beach in Cypress.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.937
Then why is it… like that?

00:22.147 --> 00:25.191
I've implanted an electrode
into its thalamus

00:25.275 --> 00:28.403
which delivers a focused ECT pulse.

00:28.486 --> 00:29.571
You put it to sleep.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.322
And…

00:32.449 --> 00:33.491
I can wake it up.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.832
This was your idea?

00:41.958 --> 00:42.959
I made a few tweaks,

00:43.043 --> 00:45.295
but this sort of research
is more my sister's thing.

00:46.504 --> 00:50.508
The procedure is too complicated to scale.
It's literally brain surgery.

00:51.134 --> 00:56.931
But… it could be interesting
with a few specific cases especially if…

00:57.766 --> 00:58.641
If what?

00:59.267 --> 01:00.268
We go bigger.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.420
You got five minutes to pack a bag.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.715
No games, no drama. In and out.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.176
Then I take you back to your dad.

01:34.385 --> 01:35.845
Jade?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.018
We don't wanna go back.

01:42.101 --> 01:43.061
Not your call.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.608
Or maybe when we get out
of the car, we'll scream.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.944
See what happens.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.824
Do it. See what happens.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.960
<i>I warned you
about the outside world, Bert.</i>

02:07.544 --> 02:09.796
I told you, you weren't ready.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.300
But you didn't listen,
and people got hurt.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.511
You could have been hurt.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.805
I… I had to help my family.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.598
-My brother, he--
-What, Albert?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.725
Please.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.145
When has he ever helped anyone
but himself?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.147
Hmm?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.149
He thought I was dead.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.359
Did you tell him that?

02:31.943 --> 02:33.361
Of course not.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.698
Look, l understand loving your family.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.032
I love my family.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.910
I'd do anything to protect them,
but Albert's not…

02:42.537 --> 02:43.830
He's…

02:45.165 --> 02:47.250
I'm the one who's taking care of you.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.670
For all these years,
I'm the one that's kept you safe.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.547
Uh… But what about the girls?

02:52.630 --> 02:54.340
I'm keeping them safe as well.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.759
Right now, they are in my office,
having ice cream.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.804
Rocky Road?

03:01.097 --> 03:03.391
It's their favorite too.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.353
And they keep asking about you.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.732
Uncle Bert, the great scientist.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.902
But I, I thought I scared them.

03:14.777 --> 03:18.031
No. I told them you're a good man.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.325
Smart.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.076
Funny.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.746
Helpful.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.624
We need your help.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.003
We've got a new project.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.672
An important project.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.343
And if you do a good job,

03:38.426 --> 03:40.970
maybe the girls can even come
and stay with you.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.349
Maybe it will get you
a house all your own.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.019
Green grass, white picket fence.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.230
Happy family.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.364
What's the project?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.536
Him.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.594
Five minutes!

04:29.102 --> 04:30.186
Dad's a clone.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.188
I know.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.108
And we're science experiments.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.028
Hey.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.822
This can't be real.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.657
Fuck it.

04:43.866 --> 04:44.701
Fuck them.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
Jade, you can't pretend
like this isn't happening.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.788
I'm not.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.041
Actually, I feel like
I'm going crazy, okay?

04:52.125 --> 04:56.838
I wanna scream and cry,
and Dad is a psycho.

04:58.047 --> 05:00.300
His boss is some Cruella de Vil bitch,

05:00.383 --> 05:03.344
and there is a guy
in our living room with a gun.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.556
So I know this is happening.

05:07.265 --> 05:12.103
I know that everyone is lying to us
about everything.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.357
Even me?

05:21.112 --> 05:23.281
And what if Dad was…

05:26.200 --> 05:27.869
What if I'm not okay?

05:30.788 --> 05:32.790
No, you are.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.086
You're, you're good, right?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.717
We just need
to get out of here.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.095
Away from Dad, this town,
Umbrella, all of it.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.514
How?

05:48.598 --> 05:49.640
The bag.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.479
It has money, passports, everything.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.440
And then what? We just…

05:58.649 --> 05:59.650
run?

06:02.612 --> 06:04.655
We run really fucking fast.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.414
This is Pablo.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.333
We have to take him with us.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.714
No. We'll send someone
to take care of him.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.007
Okay, but…

06:24.425 --> 06:25.843
he's high maintenance.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.394
He likes salmon and chicken, no beef.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.610
He gets treats every night.

06:42.693 --> 06:47.115
He hates walks,
and he takes, like, giant shits.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.408
I'll let them know.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.748
You're gonna be okay, buddy.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.717
-Sorry. He doesn't like assholes.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.886
Get your sister.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.288
Hey.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.414
You and me, right?

07:51.804 --> 07:52.763
Girls.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.975
What did I say about playing games?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.727
Run! Run!

07:58.436 --> 07:59.353
Hey!

08:03.399 --> 08:04.567
Billie?

08:09.614 --> 08:10.656
Shit.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.296
Go.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.048
What? No.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.675
Get up.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.429
Goddamn it!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.105
Come here!

08:43.189 --> 08:45.149
Go! Get help!

08:48.653 --> 08:49.570
Find her!

08:55.159 --> 08:56.285
What are you?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.474
Whatever you did, stop it!

09:19.141 --> 09:20.059
I can't.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.208
What's happening?

09:46.544 --> 09:47.461
Nothing.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.880
A lot of people are about to die.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.301
Maybe you.

09:53.801 --> 09:54.802
No.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.472
You need me.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.268
Without me…

10:03.936 --> 10:05.104
what are you?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.118
Fall back!

11:50.042 --> 11:53.379
Jade, come on.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.630
Set sail!

12:19.780 --> 12:20.823
Come on!

12:26.704 --> 12:27.621
Wait!

12:36.839 --> 12:37.673
Wait!

12:39.717 --> 12:40.968
Wait!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.472
Jade!

12:46.891 --> 12:48.309
Move, move, move!

12:51.687 --> 12:52.521
Wait!

12:59.778 --> 13:01.155
Throw it!

13:31.602 --> 13:32.770
I…

13:32.853 --> 13:34.605
I…

13:34.688 --> 13:35.648
How?

13:44.907 --> 13:47.451
-What's our speed?
-Fifteen knots and climbing, sir.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.287
Saqim!

13:51.413 --> 13:53.165
-Jade?
-Press the fucking button.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.625
-Too close.
-It doesn't matter.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.252
It won't go for us.
It will go straight for them.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.548
Okay, Saqim.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.009
I know I fucked up before.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.305
But I won't fuck this up.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.567
They get one chopper up in the air,
and we're dead.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.918
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.253
She's been bitten.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.760
It was you.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.887
That night.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.390
The dog.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.143
My dad says I'm fine.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.814
Are you?

16:24.483 --> 16:26.276
That animal was sick.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.821
If it infected you,
it makes you dangerous.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.991
To others, to yourself.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.911
Have you had any symptoms?

16:37.621 --> 16:38.789
Hallucinations?

16:39.540 --> 16:40.457
Rage?

16:41.583 --> 16:42.876
Pounding heart?

16:48.424 --> 16:49.633
Why should I believe you?

16:57.391 --> 16:59.560
I know you don't like me much, Billie.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.814
I don't like me much either,
most of the time.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.152
But I've never lied to you.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.322
Can you say that about your father?

17:17.327 --> 17:19.830
You're a fucking bitch.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.295
I'm the fucking bitch
who's telling you the fucking truth.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.256
And isn't that what you want?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.801
The fucking truth.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.811
If I am sick…

17:47.441 --> 17:48.609
can you help me?

17:51.779 --> 17:53.405
I'm the only one who can.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.124
Mom, what are you doing?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.542
It's your mother's favorite.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.461
Mm…

18:07.544 --> 18:08.754
Wait, weren't we…

18:08.837 --> 18:09.755
She's not even here.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.590
We just had
this exact same dinner with her.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.388
-Mom, are you alright?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.611
I need your help.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.072
Jade, what's wrong?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.908
-I, um…
-Who's this?

18:38.909 --> 18:41.745
Uh, this, this is Jade,
she's a friend from school.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.206
-We were just…
-Homework. Math.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.459
Look at the puppy.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.669
Hi.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.838
We're just going to go out
by the pool, all right, Mom?

18:51.547 --> 18:53.757
Have fun. Hi.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.179
-You're fucking with me.
-I'm not.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.516
-There are clones in this story, Jade.
-I know.

19:02.599 --> 19:06.103
And, and you saw
this weird shit in my house.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.647
I need to get into Umbrella.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.858
-To get your sister?
-Yeah.

19:12.025 --> 19:14.069
-Because my mom kidnapped her?
-Yes.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.532
Jade, what am I supposed
to say to that? It's, it's insane!

19:18.615 --> 19:19.658
I know.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.537
But, Simon, they're,
they're going to hurt her.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.168
I was there.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.296
I've seen what they do.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.632
Their secret labs
and their stupid Joy pills.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.259
What?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.636
What?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.600
You saw these?

19:44.683 --> 19:45.851
Yes.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.901
Mom?

19:55.277 --> 19:57.154
Mom? Mom?

19:57.237 --> 19:59.323
-Oh, my God.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.532
Shit.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.659
-It's just a scratch.
-No, it isn't.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.078
I barely feel a thing, really.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.581
Mom, are these yours?

20:08.415 --> 20:09.833
Of course not.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.045
Western medicine just treats
the symptoms, not the cause.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.381
Oh, I love this song.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.182
You're being very brave.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.520
Am I sick or not?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.362
Well?

20:39.112 --> 20:41.907
The virus is…
It's just not infecting the cells.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.037
I don't know why.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.750
It's still viable?

20:53.001 --> 20:54.253
Maybe.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.547
Find out.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.263
Get creative.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.026
Simon, it's late.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.528
Are you drugging Mom?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.242
What?

21:25.325 --> 21:27.619
<i>I found the pills. The Joy.</i>

21:29.037 --> 21:31.248
-Those are mine.
-Cut the shit, all right?

21:31.331 --> 21:34.126
She has just cut open her hand,
and she can't even feel it.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.920
<i>-So what did you do to her?</i>
-Simon.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.213
Tell me.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.801
Your mother was having trouble adjusting.

21:42.884 --> 21:46.471
We both agreed that she take medicine
to help with her anxiety.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.806
Just stop lying!

21:47.889 --> 21:49.099
Simon!

21:51.643 --> 21:55.731
I did what I had to,
to keep our family together.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.358
<i>And, and she's,
she's better. She's happier.</i>

21:58.442 --> 22:00.402
She's a fucking zombie.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.321
And you're a fucking child!

22:03.113 --> 22:06.867
Okay. You have no idea how hard I work.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.580
This company was stolen
from your grandfather, and I rebuilt it,

22:11.663 --> 22:13.832
and your mother she never, she never…

22:19.296 --> 22:21.131
<i>She wanted to leave.</i>

22:22.174 --> 22:24.092
She wanted to take you away.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.554
I did all of this for you.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.433
I don't want it.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.646
You don't know what you want.

22:37.647 --> 22:38.732
You…

22:39.983 --> 22:41.568
Fuck you.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.487
-Simon--

23:16.394 --> 23:18.855
Just one more test. Sorry.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.150
-What's that?
-Just relax.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.612
-No. No, what are you giving me?
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.489
It's okay. Relax, okay?

23:28.782 --> 23:30.450
Everything's okay.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.622
Everything's okay.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.165
Oh, shit.

24:54.826 --> 24:55.911
Fuck.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.005
You had to.

25:09.716 --> 25:10.800
I know.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.661
Bea?

25:44.417 --> 25:47.003
She's not in her room.
Maybe she's on deck.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.214
Bea?

26:29.754 --> 26:32.549
All right. I can override the doors
and jam the system,

26:32.632 --> 26:35.051
but that only gives us about ten minutes
before they notice.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.263
So do you know where you are going?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.015
Yeah.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.559
You don't have to come with me.

26:44.728 --> 26:45.854
Mm, I know.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.117
Come on, then.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.202
Hey.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.498
Thank you.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.016
-Calm down. Just calm down!

27:24.976 --> 27:26.561
My sister?

27:26.644 --> 27:29.481
I gave her a shot of adrenaline.
She's in v-tach and seizing!

27:29.564 --> 27:32.233
I want my sister!

27:32.317 --> 27:34.319
The cart. I need the sedatives!

27:51.628 --> 27:53.296
Calm down, okay?

27:54.005 --> 27:54.964
You lied to me!

29:07.203 --> 29:09.831
Breathe. Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.542
-Breathe.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.043
Hands above your head.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.345
How did you… how did you know about that?

29:25.221 --> 29:26.055
Albert.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.278
You weren't eating ice cream, were you?

29:41.654 --> 29:42.572
What?

29:58.171 --> 30:00.423
-I need to get out of here.
-Okay.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.133
-We'll find your dad.
-No.

30:06.596 --> 30:09.974
I don't care about him.
He doesn't care about me.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.311
Yes, he does.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.440
When he was locked up,
all he wanted was to help his girls.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.817
Because we're his medicine.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.028
He needs our blood to stay alive.

30:23.780 --> 30:24.906
So?

30:25.782 --> 30:27.116
"So"?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.285
My dad needed me
and my brothers too.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.621
So he kept us locked away for a long time.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.790
We didn't even see the sun
until we were all grown up.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.626
But Albert's not like that.
He gave you a life.

30:36.709 --> 30:37.544
And maybe…

30:38.586 --> 30:41.589
I'm not saying he was right,
or even good, but…

30:42.882 --> 30:44.175
he could've been worse.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.387
So that makes… that makes it okay?

30:47.470 --> 30:48.596
No, but…

30:50.348 --> 30:51.891
Well, maybe there's no such thing.

30:53.518 --> 30:57.188
Maybe life's just a bunch of accidents
and tragedies and…

30:58.398 --> 31:01.150
No one's really okay.
We're all just doing our best.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.113
In a world where it's way too easy
to do your worst.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.075
Your dad loves you.

31:09.158 --> 31:12.036
Well, maybe
it's a messed up kind of love, but…

31:13.162 --> 31:16.374
Well, they kind of all are
when you think about it.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.964
But, if you want, we can leave him.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.301
If we do…

31:29.929 --> 31:31.347
what happens?

31:34.809 --> 31:35.977
Nothing good.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.589
-Jade?
-Don't get excited.

32:04.672 --> 32:05.798
Where is Billie?

32:05.882 --> 32:07.175
She's not with you?

32:08.384 --> 32:10.011
-Hi, I'm…
-Evelyn's son.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.137
What happened?

32:11.721 --> 32:13.222
We tried to run, but…

32:14.223 --> 32:15.183
they took Billie.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.063
I think they know she got bit.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.732
-We need to find her now.
-You're not coming with us.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.527
Just tell me where she is.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.071
-Jade, I…

32:31.741 --> 32:34.202
Hey, family reunion.

32:37.121 --> 32:37.956
Hey, bro.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.251
-Oh, we're…
-Clones.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.005
-Did they hurt you? Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.800
I have the bag,
and I left Pablo with Simon's mom.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.093
We have to go.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.512
He's coming with us.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.181
-What? Why?
-Because we can't leave him here.

33:08.695 --> 33:09.529
Ten minutes.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.617
-What's happening?
-They're locking down.

33:18.997 --> 33:19.956
This way.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.502
This is all my fault.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.669
Jade, don't.

34:50.588 --> 34:51.798
We're gonna bring her home.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.512
There. There.

35:00.807 --> 35:01.933
Hey.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.560
She couldn't have gotten far.

35:08.773 --> 35:10.066
Arjun!

35:41.222 --> 35:42.306
This way.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.233
Hide. In there.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.111
-Right, everyone in there.
-Okay.

36:11.460 --> 36:12.420
Shit.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.839
Okay, okay.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.135
-Yes!

36:24.765 --> 36:25.766
You!

36:29.187 --> 36:32.648
None of you would even be alive
without me.

36:34.942 --> 36:37.445
So I think it's time for a "thank you."

36:39.447 --> 36:41.741
A little fucking respect!

36:49.790 --> 36:51.042
It's…

36:54.545 --> 36:56.005
Hey.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.424
You're okay.

37:01.928 --> 37:02.887
All right, this way.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.098
Come on.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.980
Jade? Billie! Billie!

37:14.398 --> 37:16.359
Billie, stop.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.569
Let go!

37:19.862 --> 37:20.863
Southwest Hall.

37:32.917 --> 37:33.834
No.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.005
Halt!

37:46.889 --> 37:47.974
Simon?

37:49.308 --> 37:50.393
Mom.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.853
No.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.565
She bit me.

38:11.455 --> 38:12.623
Evelyn.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.544
Evelyn.

38:17.753 --> 38:18.963
I can fix him.

38:20.047 --> 38:21.215
I'll find a way.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.217
But…

38:25.428 --> 38:27.722
you have to let my girls go.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.436
You know it's his only chance.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.484
Mom?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.407
-Mom--

38:50.077 --> 38:52.955
No!

39:26.322 --> 39:27.573
Dad!

39:27.656 --> 39:29.617
No!

39:31.077 --> 39:32.453
No! No!

39:32.536 --> 39:33.746
No!

40:29.718 --> 40:32.263
Arjun. Arjun.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.059
Arjun… Arjun!

40:38.811 --> 40:39.854
Arjun.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.148
Arjun.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.192
Ar… Arjun.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.027
Arjun!

40:47.111 --> 40:48.154
Arjun!

40:50.322 --> 40:53.659
-Oh.
-Hey.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.955
-Oh, God.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.665
-Can you move it?

41:00.791 --> 41:01.917
No.

41:06.714 --> 41:07.673
You have to go.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.675
Find her.

41:12.761 --> 41:13.971
Jade, go.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.141
Go!

41:36.660 --> 41:38.913
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Go!

41:38.996 --> 41:40.498
Let's move it!

43:56.717 --> 43:57.801
Bea?

43:59.136 --> 44:00.262
Mom!

44:07.186 --> 44:08.479
Where's Dad?

44:08.562 --> 44:09.938
I…

44:16.695 --> 44:17.946
Stay close.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.249
Hey, Mama.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.336
And here I thought
I was the best liar in the family.

44:34.004 --> 44:34.963
Kid's cute.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.674
What'd you do to her?

44:37.383 --> 44:40.386
Oh, 'cause Lyle the Crocodile back there,

44:40.469 --> 44:43.514
he could have ripped her
in half, except didn't.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.974
That's weird, right?

44:47.935 --> 44:49.186
It's weird.

44:49.269 --> 44:50.938
You mess with her DNA?

44:51.897 --> 44:53.691
Give her the old Wesker special?

44:53.774 --> 44:55.359
-Mom?
-It's okay.

44:55.901 --> 44:57.986
Of course, it is. Hi, sweetie.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.322
Stay the fuck away from her.

45:14.837 --> 45:15.754
No.

45:17.423 --> 45:19.550
It's always gonna be no.

45:20.467 --> 45:23.679
And you should have known that.
I mean twins, right?

45:24.263 --> 45:25.180
We're the same.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.641
No, we're not.

45:29.435 --> 45:35.274
Ever since that night, you are heartless.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.067
Hopeless.

45:38.193 --> 45:41.321
<i>That night was
the worst night of my life.</i>

45:42.823 --> 45:45.576
-That was when I lost my sister.
-No, it wasn't.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.412
See, that's what you never got.

45:50.122 --> 45:53.584
The T, it stripped away all my…
Fucking bullshit.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.711
The fear, the anxiety.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.921
It didn't make me somebody else.

45:58.964 --> 46:01.049
It let me be who I always was.

46:02.176 --> 46:03.844
I was just too scared to admit it.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.681
That…

46:08.390 --> 46:11.393
was the best night of my life.

46:15.772 --> 46:16.982
What are you?

46:19.860 --> 46:21.069
I'm the future.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.739
And you?

46:24.781 --> 46:26.241
You're a fucking virus.

46:27.784 --> 46:30.496
I mean, you ever notice
how everyone around you somehow…

46:31.413 --> 46:32.748
dies?

46:33.874 --> 46:35.042
Simon?

46:35.125 --> 46:36.335
Bert?

46:36.418 --> 46:38.045
Kim? Hiroki?

46:40.214 --> 46:41.215
Dad?

46:41.965 --> 46:43.133
I can keep going.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.387
You keep telling yourself
you're trying to save lives,

46:47.971 --> 46:51.683
but your hands, Jade,
they're covered in blood.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.810
Because you're selfish.

46:53.894 --> 46:57.731
Because you only care about the mission
about fixing what you started.

46:57.814 --> 47:00.025
So people die, but you keep going.

47:00.108 --> 47:02.986
You don't stop
because that's what matters. You.

47:05.322 --> 47:08.992
It's still always the fucking Jade show.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.054
Fine.

47:32.641 --> 47:33.767
Take me.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.187
Just…

47:37.813 --> 47:38.981
Please just…

47:45.904 --> 47:47.155
Let her go.

48:07.509 --> 48:08.885
I don't need you anymore.

48:16.977 --> 48:17.936
Mom?

48:19.062 --> 48:20.480
Hey, Mom?

48:22.858 --> 48:25.152
-Bea!
-No! No!

48:26.570 --> 48:28.196
Bea!

48:29.948 --> 48:31.199
Mom!

48:31.283 --> 48:34.036
Bea!

49:20.540 --> 49:21.917
Go, go! Go, go, go!

49:35.097 --> 49:36.223
They're everywhere.

49:51.947 --> 49:53.448
What are you doing?

49:53.532 --> 49:55.033
Making a bomb.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.993
Evelyn won't stop unless we make her stop.

50:13.009 --> 50:15.846
Bert, get them somewhere safe.

50:15.929 --> 50:18.265
What? What about you?

50:21.184 --> 50:22.477
Someone has to set it off.

50:27.524 --> 50:28.817
Dad?

50:30.026 --> 50:31.570
You don't have to do this.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.255
I love you.

50:54.718 --> 50:55.761
Dad.

50:59.347 --> 51:00.557
I'm sorry.

51:03.852 --> 51:05.020
You don't have to.

51:06.772 --> 51:07.898
I'll do it.

51:16.072 --> 51:17.199
No.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.167
You deserve a life, Bert.

51:53.026 --> 51:54.110
Let's go!

52:08.041 --> 52:09.209
Go out the back.

52:10.210 --> 52:11.336
Find her.

52:51.167 --> 52:52.669
There he is!

53:01.219 --> 53:02.721
Come on! Come on!

53:07.851 --> 53:08.727
My son.

53:10.437 --> 53:11.563
I loved him.

53:12.564 --> 53:13.440
You killed him.

53:17.485 --> 53:21.865
I was protecting him
from becoming a monster.

53:27.454 --> 53:29.247
But when this is over…

53:30.916 --> 53:32.042
All of it…

53:32.792 --> 53:35.962
Everything I sacrificed…

53:36.046 --> 53:40.008
…I'm gonna change the world.

53:44.596 --> 53:47.182
I have the future.

53:49.893 --> 53:51.519
What do you have?

53:55.190 --> 53:57.192
I have a pen.

55:15.103 --> 55:17.230
I didn't mean to hurt you.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.151
Or Simon.

55:22.110 --> 55:24.863
I, I… I just…
