38:25.884 --> 38:27.585
so the press is saying
she's crazy, et cetera.

38:27.685 --> 38:28.985
- Exactly.

38:29.085 --> 38:32.025
- But she is
really struggling, so...

38:32.125 --> 38:33.185
- Yeah.

38:33.285 --> 38:34.586
I mean, it is a lot of jam.

38:34.686 --> 38:36.386
- Yeah, and if that
does become the case,

38:36.486 --> 38:39.986
well, we only have
one former contestant.

38:40.086 --> 38:41.227
- Surprise!
- Ah!

38:41.327 --> 38:42.987
- Yeah.
[laughs]

38:43.087 --> 38:44.187
- Listen, I know Georgina.

38:44.287 --> 38:45.787
I love Georgina, you know?

38:45.887 --> 38:49.748
I myself have suffered
from eating disorders myself--

38:49.848 --> 38:51.348
not, you know, now.

38:51.448 --> 38:53.388
But those are actually
the mental illnesses

38:53.488 --> 38:55.629
that most often result
in death in this country,

38:55.729 --> 38:58.389
so it's really not something
to mess about with.

38:58.489 --> 39:00.109
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

39:00.209 --> 39:02.070
- Yeah, well, I thought
that was depression.

39:02.170 --> 39:03.350
- No, anorexia nervosa.

39:03.450 --> 39:04.790
- Well, depression for men.

39:04.890 --> 39:06.270
- Oh, that's interesting.

39:06.370 --> 39:08.751
- Yeah, depression for men,
anorexia for women.

39:08.851 --> 39:10.671
Also, I suppose that depression
doesn't actually kill the men.

39:10.771 --> 39:13.151
It's whatever it is,
the gun or bridge

39:13.251 --> 39:15.192
or technically whatever they,
you know--

39:15.292 --> 39:17.512
well, not the bridge,
the fall from the bridge--

39:17.612 --> 39:19.952
or not even the fall,
the impact.

39:20.052 --> 39:22.113
Anyway, we all have
different ways

39:22.213 --> 39:23.513
of killing ourselves, so...

- Yeah, self-care.
- Mm.

we need to look at,

you know,

39:31.894 --> 39:33.914

I think, yeah.

39:34.014 --> 39:35.395

even more
