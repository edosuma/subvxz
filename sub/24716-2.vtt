How's everyone doing today?

00:04.838 --> 00:06.756
I’ve heard the name Bale
from internal affairs.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.633
-You related?
-That's me. I realize

00:08.842 --> 00:09.843
that carries a certain stigma,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.720

to be an excellent boss.

It’s hard enough for a female
on the job to get respect.

One of the ways to lose it in hurry
is if you’re flirtatious with guys.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.655
I’ve never had a problem
with a guy in a work situation.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.533

are with other women on the job.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.227

12:14.358 --> 12:16.277

-(SIGHS)
-(DOOR OPENS)

12:29.039 --> 12:30.499
Hi, I’m Steve Mcclintock.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.502
Detectives Sipowicz and Clark.
You know a girl named Tina Most?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.838
-Yeah. She all right?
-How do you know her?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.841
I volunteer weekends down at the
Bowery Free Clinic. She’s a patient.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.844
Michael Cozen and his wife, Julia,
you set them up with Tina?

12:43.137 --> 12:45.431
You don’t want the not-so-free clinic
to know about it?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.601
The Cozens were desperate.
So was Tina. I just made a phone call.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.561
Oh, and ripped the Cozens off
for five grand.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.523
The prenatal care for Tina Most’s kid
that she supposedly miscarried.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.858
What do you mean "supposedly"?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.235
As of this morning,
Tina was still pregnant.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.031
-Well, then she lied. She lied to me.
-Or you’re running a scam.

13:02.156 --> 13:05.409
Oh, no. I’m not even involved.
All I did was pass on information.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.912
Michael Cozen makes you more
of an active third party.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.830
Yeah, well, he’s wrong.

13:10.498 --> 13:14.001
A very rich lady’s on the procedure table
back there with her legs in the air, so...

13:14.126 --> 13:15.586
Where were you last night
till this morning?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.213
-I’ve really got to get back.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

13:17.630 --> 13:20.716
Tina Most was murdered, Steve.
We’re talking now.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.593
My God, that’s awful.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.428
Where were you last night
till this morning?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.764
Uh, I was with my girlfriend
at her apartment.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.475
-Who is she? Where do we find her?
-Her name’s Carly Landes.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.561
-This is so awful.
-Let’s get you to the station house.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.313
That’s the best place to absorb it.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.941
Uh, yeah, um,
I’m in the middle of a procedure.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.944
-Okay, someone needs to take over for him.
-Let’s go.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.661
Copper?

13:50.579 --> 13:52.915
Overdosage of copper,
ten times what you’d ever need.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.084
-What’d you put in copper for?
-I didn’t.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.544
You’re the only one who treats the tank.

13:56.669 --> 14:01.215
I’d only use copper if I saw uredinium,
which I don’t, I never have in this tank.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.424
It wasn’t me.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.260
Anybody touch the fish tank?

14:04.802 --> 14:07.596
-Just dumped some pennies in.
-These fish are dying here.

-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-So, uh, what do you do about it?

14:10.266 --> 14:13.185
Partial water cleansing,
then filter with activated carbon.

14:13.310 --> 14:16.063
But, uh, first I got to get some water.
To get the fish out of here.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.107
Uh, whatever you got to do.
I’ll cover it, it’s my dime.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.985
No answer at home from Carly Landes.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.153
LAURA: She’s also not at the work
number Mcclintock gave you.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.281
But she’s a registered nurse
at various clinics.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.074
Today, she’s at The Rose Singer infirmary.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.118
-At Rikers?
-The D.O.A., Tina Most,

14:29.243 --> 14:31.412
did six months in Rikers.
They must have known each other.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.539
So, Carly Landes
was part of this adoption scam?

14:33.664 --> 14:34.832
ANDY: Well, that’s the question.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.042
She’s scheduled to be at the infirmary
in half an hour.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.419
Great job.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.718
-How’s she working out?
-We got different approaches.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.636
Admit it. You’re jealous.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.681
-Of what?
-Yeah, she’s miss cute, all bubbly.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.933
-Guys dig her.
-So I should be jealous of that?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.268
All right, we got someplace to be.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.686
RITA: You want to partner up with her?

14:55.811 --> 14:57.271
Sack out in your car
like you've been doing,

14:57.354 --> 14:58.898
steam up the windows a little,
be my guest.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.693
Damn. What’d I say?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.280
-We’re leaving.
-To where?

15:06.530 --> 15:09.325
Rikers, to talk to Steve Mcclintock’s
girlfriend.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.160
THOMAS: And Mcclintock’s
still down in the cell?

15:11.285 --> 15:12.828
(SIGHS) Yeah, like we told you.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.581
-And how’s the girlfriend fit in?
-She's the girlfriend, huh?

15:15.664 --> 15:18.167
She’s banging the guy.
Instead of pulling in random people

15:18.250 --> 15:20.794
off the street, we figure she might be
worth a conversation.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.964
Do you remember an announcement I made
earlier about being kept up to the minute?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.091
Because this is the first
I heard about a girlfriend.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.010
-I’ll get you up to speed, boss.
-Great.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.971
But the next time I have to ask,
someone takes a rip.

-Go to hell.
-You involved in this with Leon Belcon?

15:54.370 --> 15:55.412
What’s he saying?

15:55.496 --> 15:58.290
He gave you up for consideration
over ripping off his wife.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.252
Get us the ring back,
you could get some, too.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.964
-What the hell you talking about?
-Belcon’s wife.

16:05.422 --> 16:08.258
-You busted in, taped her up.
-Belcon said I robbed his wife?

that he was helping Tina find
the best adoptive family for her baby.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.058
You know about him selling her child
and then lying about a miscarriage?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.061
-Steven would never do that.
-Well, someone did.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.645
To a family named Cozen.

Well, then, it must’ve been Tina.

and she was in some pretty bad debt.

-To who?
-Drug dealer she burned.

She said that she owed him 20,000 dollars.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.364
Or you’re lying
and there’s a scam going on.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.618
Whatever money Steven had access to
from the Cozens

17:57.701 --> 18:00.287
was spent on T.R.W. reports,
private investigators,

18:00.370 --> 18:03.457
and prenatal care for Tina.
He kept none of that money.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.168
-How’d he find Tina? Through you?
-No.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.545
You didn’t get
a sense of her in the infirmary

18:08.629 --> 18:09.755
and then set her up with Steve?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.381
Get a sense of her for what?

18:11.507 --> 18:15.094
Her willingness to run this adoption con
on desperate yuppies.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.263
There’s no con.
At least, not one Steve and I know about.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.974
Yeah, but there is an unlicensed
adoption scheme.

to describe an efficient path

18:23.894 --> 18:24.937

It’s a coincidence that Tina did time
at Rikers where you work.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.794
He wrote her four checks
for over 2,000 in the last year.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.088
And she did 12 weeks in Rikers
during her pregnancy.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.341
So you’re thinking Mcclintock’s
been running this adoption scam

22:22.424 --> 22:24.468
-with other women?
-That’s how we’re going at her.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.178
Were you aware of this research?

22:27.220 --> 22:28.263
Just what I overheard.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.767
Then it’s only you and Clark
taking a one-day rip.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.770
You got to be joking.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.981
Did I make a specific announcement,
about being kept informed?

22:38.315 --> 22:39.900
Did I make a second announcement

22:39.983 --> 22:41.902
with the warning
that if I wasn’t informed,

22:41.985 --> 22:44.571
-there’d be discipline?
-Things move fast around here, Lieutenant.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.740
-It’s a waste of time.
-To keep the boss informed,

22:46.823 --> 22:50.285
so that he can properly handle phone calls
from suspects or interviewees?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.703
Or from the brass?

22:51.787 --> 22:56.958
Or from the Chief of D’s or 1PP?
You think it’s a waste of time? I don’t.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.087
A one-day rip
or we’ll go to the trial room.

23:05.592 --> 23:09.721
I, uh, know this is a bad time here,
detective. But, uh,

23:09.971 --> 23:12.432
-Clown Loach is belly-up.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.309

23:14.393 --> 23:16.269
That’s enough being a wise ass.
You hear me?

23:26.279 --> 23:27.948
So you’re clear at the outset, Lenny.

23:28.031 --> 23:31.493
The coke, the whores, and the stolen ring.
Puts you at a disadvantage.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.994
Like, just walking in, you’re a collar.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.039
You want to work off the coke and pross?

23:36.873 --> 23:38.083
Where’d you get the ring?

23:38.333 --> 23:40.794
-It was given to me.
-Lorraine Stuval gave it to you?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.505
-Yeah.
-Payment for tying her up

23:43.588 --> 23:47.426
-and beating the crap out of her?
-No, she gave me 300 dollars for that.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.052
The ring was gonna be returned.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.640
Why would she pay you
for beating her face in?

23:53.765 --> 23:56.810
-I don’t know. Insurance fraud, maybe?
-You didn’t ask why?

23:57.561 --> 24:00.105
Lorraine’s not the kind of woman
you question a whole lot.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.773
-Because?
-She’s a battle-ax.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.233
She likes pushing me around.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.610
So, you were banging her?

24:06.236 --> 24:08.155
So, you’d do anything she said?

24:08.530 --> 24:11.908
Ah, maybe I like being pushed around.
(LAUGHS)

24:12.868 --> 24:14.703
Still, I don’t know why she wanted
to stage a robbery.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.913
Well, you’re gonna need to make some
educated guesses.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.416
Or you’re on the hook
for robbery and assault.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.377
She’s been miserable
since this husband showed up.

24:22.502 --> 24:25.088
Then she called up,
needed me for this. That’s all I know.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.632
-She trying to frame her husband for it?
-I don’t know.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.469
What do you know, Lenny?
’Cause we’re getting frustrated.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.762
She likes convicts.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.349
And she married this guy thinking
he’d spend the rest of his life in jail,

24:36.475 --> 24:38.768
and then when he got out,
she wanted no part of him.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.438
-Why not?
-All she’d say is, um,

24:41.563 --> 24:44.274
"He’s institutionalized.
"He’s institutionalized."

24:44.774 --> 24:47.611
-Meaning what?
-I don’t know. I swear, I don’t know.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.281

-Sorry.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.376

two grand, and you don’t know him?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.422

What was the money for?

25:07.506 --> 25:08.507
Stereo equipment.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.425
You denied knowing him
over stereo equipment?

25:10.842 --> 25:15.430
It was my ex-boyfriend’s,
who may have acquired it illegally.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.182
-So, right.
-You ever been in jail?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.476

-Yeah.

-Is Steve gonna know that I talked to you?
-ANDY: He might.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.280
Oh, that’s reassuring.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.242
Would you feel cozier in jail?
’Cause you still owe four months.

How’d you hook up with him?

25:54.553 --> 25:58.014
His girlfriend in the Rikers infirmary
steered me to a free clinic

25:58.098 --> 26:00.517
-for when I got out.
-Bowery Free Clinic.

26:01.142 --> 26:04.479
Steve approached me there, asking
did I want to make some easy cash.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.605
Why’d he threaten you?

26:05.730 --> 26:09.818
Saying over and over that I miscarried,
was making me cry a lot,

26:09.901 --> 26:13.488
and what I was doing to these couples
was making my soul feel rotten.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.907
Which I did not want
to pass on to my baby,

26:15.991 --> 26:18.743
so I threatened to cop to the scam
with the last couple I worked.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.205
Steve said if I did,
he’d shoot me in the head.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.000
And dump my body in the river,
and then he slammed me against the wall,

26:25.083 --> 26:26.543

I met at the Bowery Free Clinic.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.488
Indecisive?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.866
She approached me about putting
her child up for adoption.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.118
When it came down to actually
committing to it, she’d back out.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.162
How do you explain
the two grand you paid her?

27:02.787 --> 27:05.290
Four separate times I found families
like the Cozens,

27:05.373 --> 27:08.335
that Pauline agreed would be
perfect candidates to adopt her child.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.630
Four separate times I was supplied
with money for background work,

27:11.713 --> 27:15.842
prenatal care. Each time, Pauline asked me
to front her 500 dollars for expenses

27:15.967 --> 27:17.427
then she’d back out of the adoption.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.928
And you kept the 20 grand.

we will be talking to the D.A.

to get Leon thrown back in jail

soft on the inside.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.942
They care that you made the trip
to see them and write them letters,

33:06.025 --> 33:07.235
so they treat you gently.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.906
They aren’t terrified of honking car horns
or always asking permissions

33:11.990 --> 33:16.369

outside he’s useless.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.163
-He belongs in jail.
-Not your decision.

33:28.589 --> 33:29.966
So, what’s going on?

33:31.426 --> 33:32.719
Tina Most, a decent girl?

33:33.344 --> 33:34.429
She seemed like it.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.765
What was her attitude about pulling this
adoption scam on rich folks?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.267
-She all...
-There’s no scam.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.644
The other women you ran the con,
will testify there was.

33:42.895 --> 33:45.231
I’m sorry, I don’t know
what women you’re talking about.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.483
We talked to Pauline Weikel
and we’re looking at the other girls

33:47.650 --> 33:51.279
that you steered from the Rikers infirmary
to the Bowery Free Clinic.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.866
Reliable medical care was the only thing
that I steered them towards.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.452
-And you knew nothing past that?
-Nothing.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.830
Then why did you lie about
being home all night with Steve?

34:00.913 --> 34:02.498
-I didn’t.
-No?

34:02.582 --> 34:06.669
Well, his credit card was used
late last night at a market downtown.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.254
The clerk I.D.’d his photo.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.262
Oh, God. Is that Tina?

34:16.471 --> 34:18.931
Eight months pregnant
and strangled to death.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.851
Now Tina was decent. You think she might
have got a conscience

34:21.934 --> 34:24.270
-about running these scams?
-No. Listen, I swear to you

34:24.353 --> 34:25.938
I don’t know anything about any scam.

34:26.564 --> 34:28.691
Steve threatened to kill Pauline
if she got a conscience.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.402
He said he’d put a gun to her head,
blow her brains out,

34:31.486 --> 34:33.404
-and dump her in the river.
-Oh, my God.

34:33.529 --> 34:36.157
Look at this girl.
Did she deserve to die like this?

34:37.658 --> 34:39.744

for the guy who did it?

and then he put it to my head.

-What did you know about this scam?
-Nothing. I swear.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.807
But I did know that there was something
a little bit off about those adoptions.

35:01.182 --> 35:02.600
Was he with you all night?

-When did he come home?
-He came home late, he was frantic.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.318
He said that something bad
had happened with Tina,

35:12.443 --> 35:15.279
and that if I said anything,
if anyone asked,

35:15.446 --> 35:19.450
that he had been home all night long.
If I said anything different,

35:20.034 --> 35:23.204
he would kill me. (SOBS)

-What did you buy?
-I didn’t go to any market.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.309
Heavy-duty garbage bags and rope.
That’s what the clerk said.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.978
I was home all night with my girlfriend.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.187
She says different.

35:48.271 --> 35:51.983
You came home agitated and threatened
to kill her if she didn’t back you up.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.067
Not true.

35:54.026 --> 35:57.321
You’re a half-ass con man, Steve.
You barely covered your tracks.

And the worst thing you could
do now is keep denying this.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.451
-And go to trial without an angle.
-Tina got a heart,

36:02.535 --> 36:04.787
threatened to expose your scam,
you strangled her.
