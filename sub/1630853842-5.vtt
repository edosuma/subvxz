WEBVTT

00:26.943 --> 00:29.654
Boss? Boss, wake up.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.743
Hey, boss, come on, get up.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.037
I mean it, seriously.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.541
We gotta get you out of here.
Gotta get your ruby back.

00:41.624 --> 00:45.003
But we can't do that
unless you wake the fuck up!

00:45.086 --> 00:46.379
Wake up!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.575
-Anywhere you like, hon.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.868
I'll be right with you.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.369
Don't go away.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.789
We're about to serve you
a thousand-gallon cup of coffee,

01:20.872 --> 01:22.457
right after Traffic with Terri.

01:22.540 --> 01:26.127
Right. Uh, looking at traffic,
95 is backed up for a few miles

01:26.211 --> 01:29.047
after an accident
involving two semitrucks.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.342
It seems one of the trucks
was carrying hazardous materials.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.135
Luckily, nothing was spilled…

01:48.108 --> 01:51.069
-Thanks, Lindy. Have a good night.
-You too.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.154
Best seat in the house.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.825
How are you doing today?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.079
How am I doing? Well…

02:03.164 --> 02:06.417
I'm feeling better than I have
for quite some time. Thank you.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
Mmm. I could use some of that.
What's your secret?

02:10.296 --> 02:11.673
Shall I tell you the truth?

02:12.423 --> 02:14.259
Well, honesty is the best policy.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.845
That's what they say, isn't it?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.347
Well, I hope it's true.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.932
This…

02:24.018 --> 02:25.395
is my secret.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.856
It's gorgeous.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.275
It makes dreams come true.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.070
I bet it does.

02:35.613 --> 02:39.325
And what are you dreaming about?
New house? New job?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.704
A new world. A more honest one.

02:43.788 --> 02:45.248
That is the dream, isn't it?

02:46.374 --> 02:50.920
Well, can I get you a cup of coffee
while we wait for our dream to come true?

02:51.546 --> 02:54.716
Please. But we won't be waiting for long.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.135
Then I better hurry up
and get you that coffee.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.268
Next, we have
one of our favorite friends at the show,

03:05.351 --> 03:09.022
Dr. Brenda, in studio to talk about
a new diet that's sweeping the nation.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.774
Coffee, Lindy?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.443
Oh, I better not, hon.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.821
I'm at the end of a double,
and Marsh will be here soon.

03:18.656 --> 03:22.744
Uh, would you mind watching the front door
while I'm in the ladies room?

03:22.827 --> 03:25.038
Now, that much I can handle.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.627
I'll be right back to take your order.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.755
No rush. I have everything I need for now.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.460
…are advising that
drivers detour on 195 if they can.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.629
We'll keep you updated
as weather situations…

04:14.712 --> 04:16.047
You by yourself, Lindy?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.841
No one on the floor.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.260
No, Bette's here.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.139
It looks like
that particular weather pattern…

04:30.478 --> 04:33.314
-Hi, Marsh.
-Bette.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.858
Have fun, you two.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.778
Mama's got a date
with her blackout curtains.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.196
See you, Lindy.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.450
How are you, Marsh? You good?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.286
Yeah.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.754
Predicting
severe thunderstorms

04:56.838 --> 04:58.881
from a storm front
moving in from the south.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.426
Now, those should clear up
by your drive home and…

05:02.635 --> 05:05.888
Judy, you wanna sit
or get something to go?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.056
Hmm?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.475
Coffee? I just made a fresh pot.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.185
God, yes.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.773
I'm gonna pee.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.776
If, uh… If Donna comes,
will you tell her I'm here?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.069
Sure.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.487
Will you tell her to wait?

05:22.739 --> 05:25.199
-Absolutely.
-Thanks, Bette.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.252
Hey, give me a minute.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.721
Hey.

05:46.804 --> 05:50.016
Hey, I got your text. What's going on?

05:50.099 --> 05:52.518
Is Donna there with you?

05:52.602 --> 05:55.563
No, why? You guys okay?

05:55.646 --> 05:56.939
Yeah, we just…

05:57.023 --> 06:02.111
We had this stupid fight last night
and she left around midnight and…

06:02.904 --> 06:06.407
-and never came home. So, of course, I'm…

06:10.203 --> 06:11.788
freaking the fuck out.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.082
I'm so sorry, Jude.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.042
-You haven't heard from her?
-No.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.004
-Rose?
-I haven't, I swear.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.423
-Did you try her mom's?

06:22.965 --> 06:24.425
She wouldn't go to her mom's.

06:25.843 --> 06:26.719
Would she?

06:26.803 --> 06:29.555
Do you want me
to call over there and find out?

06:29.639 --> 06:30.473
No.

06:31.307 --> 06:35.311
I should at least pretend to be a grown-up
and call her myself.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.229
Okay, then.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.740
I guess Judy and Donna
had another fight last night.

06:48.408 --> 06:52.245
Donna left and never came home.
Now Judy's calling all over town, frantic.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.166
I don't know why Judy's
wasting her time on Donna Cavanagh.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.586
Judy's so pretty,
she could have any man in town.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.468
I think some people
are just afraid to be happy, you know?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.555
We're running low on mushrooms.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.641
I'll make a note.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.194
One for lunch, handsome?

07:25.778 --> 07:29.240
Uh, is it okay if I… I'm kinda early
for an interview in the neighborhood.

07:29.323 --> 07:32.869
-Is it okay if I just have coffee?
-Of course, I just made a fresh pot.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.955
I'll set you up right here.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.419
You interviewing at Vanguard?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.546
How do you know?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.549
Not a lot of places around here
make you wear a suit to an interview.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.843
I don't wear them very often.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.928
Well, you should. It looks good on you.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.516
They're gonna love you.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.105
You're very nice. Thank you.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.607
I'm not being nice. I just…

08:03.816 --> 08:05.318
I get a sense about people.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.903
You're gonna get this job.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.370
Judy, coffee's ready.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.044
I'll just, uh, refill these creamers.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.714
No offense, but I'm waiting for someone.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.092
Well, I can move
if you two would rather sit here.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.135
We're good, thanks.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.805
I'm Mark, by the way.

08:35.389 --> 08:36.891
And I'm gay, so…

08:46.734 --> 08:48.069
Did you look at the menu?

08:48.736 --> 08:52.615
I confess, I've been rather distracted.
Perhaps you could recommend something.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.201
There they are!

08:55.284 --> 08:57.328
I am… I'm so sorry. Just one sec.

08:57.411 --> 08:58.704
Of course.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.416
Happy anniversary, you two!
How are you on your special day?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.544
-How do you remember?
-Every single year.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.380
How could I forget?
You two are my proudest achievement.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.173
That's just sad.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.425
She set them up.

09:11.509 --> 09:12.426
I set them up.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.262
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, wow.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.346
They were regulars…

09:15.429 --> 09:17.348
Two of my best customers.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.226
She thinks she has
this sense about people--

09:20.309 --> 09:23.688
I get this sense about people.
So one day I sat them down side by side…

09:23.771 --> 09:24.939
Where you're sitting now.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.400
…and here we all are, five years later.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.068
The five best years of my life.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.778
Stop it.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.364
-Congratulations.
-Happy anniversary.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.032
Thank you so much.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.409
You think it's sweet?

09:37.868 --> 09:39.662
What if she does have
a sense about people?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.914
She just tried to set us up.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.086
-How's work going?
-Good. Busy.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.172
Garry's supervising a new venture
that looks promising.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.674
Right, sweetie?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.884
How are you, Bette? How's Bernard doing?

09:53.968 --> 09:56.429
-How's the writing going?
-Yeah, how's the novel?

09:56.512 --> 09:59.348
Uh, good, you know.
I thought I'd have more time to write

09:59.432 --> 10:03.060
with Bernard off at college,
but it's been great having him home, so…

10:07.440 --> 10:08.691
What'll I get you two?

10:08.774 --> 10:09.775
Oh.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.235
We will have…

10:12.445 --> 10:13.654
The usual, sweetie?

10:14.322 --> 10:15.448
Spinach salads.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.325
-Order up.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.493
Oof. Look at that burger.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.790
Oh, you've been so disciplined.
We don't want to ruin your macros.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.542
Mmm, but it's our anniversary.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.921
You're right. We're celebrating.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.757
You should get whatever you want.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.885
Don't say that
or I'll get the double-decker.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.223
What's the double-decker?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.351
Oh, it's got two of everything.
Two patties,

10:43.434 --> 10:45.728
two layers of bacon,
cheese, two fried eggs.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.104
Oh, God.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.231
See?

10:50.399 --> 10:51.525
Get it.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.736
I mean, if that's what you want.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.455
I'll have the salad.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.832
I admire your discipline.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.169
Both of you. Spinach salads on the way.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.429
-Thanks.
-They're trying to help people.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.683
They're trying to enslave people.
That's what Big Pharma does.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.979
-You'll find out once you get the job.
-What makes you think I'll get it?

11:30.147 --> 11:32.316
Vanguard fucking loves people like you.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.526
They're from Vanguard?

11:33.609 --> 11:34.652
That's the CEO.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.363
You're kidding. What's his name?

11:37.988 --> 11:40.282
Dude, she's the CEO.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.952
-He's the trophy husband.
-Want me to introduce you?

11:44.620 --> 11:45.830
Don't do it.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.167
Thank you,
but my level, it's probably best

11:50.251 --> 11:53.337
to stay off the CEO's radar
for as long as possible.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.340
-Thank you though.
-Well, how about lunch then?

11:56.424 --> 11:57.800
The CEO's having a spinach salad.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.219
I could have Marsh put
grilled chicken on that for you.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.180
Yeah, I've got some time.
That sounds good.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.060
Spinach salad, grilled chicken.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.697
Oh, my gosh.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.743
I'm so sorry, sir. It's their anniversary.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.495
Yes, I heard. You introduced them.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.455
I did.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.084
And you're not really
a waitress, are you, Bette?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.380
You're a writer.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.092
Well, I'm a waitress who writes.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.136
Fiction? Non-fiction?

12:43.012 --> 12:45.848
Well, my characters
are all based on real people,

12:45.931 --> 12:50.311
but it's fiction, I guess,
because all my stories have happy endings.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.231
Well, that's because
you know when to stop.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.733
How do you mean?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.611
The trouble with stories is,

12:58.694 --> 13:01.739
if you keep them going long enough,
they all end in death,

13:03.032 --> 13:04.033
don't they?

13:05.993 --> 13:07.661
-Order up.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.664
So, what'll you have, handsome?

13:12.416 --> 13:13.584
Ah.

13:13.667 --> 13:17.671
May I ask, you don't really think
I'm handsome, do you?

13:21.634 --> 13:22.802
No, of course I don't.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.516
Then why did you call me that?
Why did you lie?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.478
I don't know. I…

13:34.188 --> 13:35.815
I guess I was just trying to be…

13:38.442 --> 13:40.236
I just wanted to make you feel…

13:46.700 --> 13:47.993
I wanted you to like me.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.578
I do like you.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.791
I like this version of you
much better, don't you?

13:58.754 --> 14:01.340
Isn't it a relief
to tell the truth for once?

14:02.091 --> 14:06.220
Don't you wish we could live in a world
where we could say what we actually think?

14:08.347 --> 14:09.265
I do.

14:09.890 --> 14:15.271
Well, it starts with us, Bette, you and I.
We're going to change the world.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.022
Make a more honest one.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.212
I was trying to be supportive.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.674
By calling me fat… in front of Bette?

14:43.757 --> 14:44.675
I did not.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.598
Who keeps texting you?

14:50.681 --> 14:52.683
Shipping. They want the distro list.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.143
-Order up.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.395
I sent that to Spencer last night.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.606
I'll text him.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.899
Don't do that.

15:05.529 --> 15:09.408
When Spencer asked me a question
and you answer it? How does that look?

15:09.491 --> 15:12.036
You care too much
about what other people think.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.413
Yes, because I'm not the boss.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.167
I've no authority or credibility
when you do shit like that all the time.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.377
Lower your voice right now.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.503
Here we are.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.089
One spinach salad and one double-decker.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.595
We didn't order that.
He didn't order that.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.349
You didn't, did you? Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.476
-It's fine.
-You're not eating that.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.644
I won't eat the bun.

15:36.727 --> 15:37.770
Bette, would you mind--

15:37.853 --> 15:41.357
Can I please
just eat what I want for once, please?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.319
Thank you, Bette.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.072
Thanks, Bette.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.672
Hey, how many bars do you have?

16:05.464 --> 16:08.092
I don't think my texts are going through.
Can I text you to see?

16:08.175 --> 16:10.636
They're going through.
She doesn't wanna hear from you.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.013
What?

16:18.102 --> 16:19.895
Uh, I've got four bars.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.231
Fuck you, dude.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.128
Judy?

16:47.214 --> 16:48.549
Did you hear from Donna?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.306
You wanna wait a little while longer?

17:07.067 --> 17:08.235
I'll get you a menu.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.330
Are you all right?

17:28.672 --> 17:30.007
I don't think I am.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.341
-Order up.

17:42.102 --> 17:48.400
She left at, like, midnight
and I haven't heard from her since.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.528
She hasn't answered
my calls or my texts. I…

17:53.447 --> 17:54.615
I hope she's all right.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.242
Do you?

18:00.704 --> 18:03.540
No. Hope she's been
in a fucking car accident,

18:03.624 --> 18:05.918
at least that would explain
why she hasn't texted back.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.378
Why did she leave?

18:09.213 --> 18:11.590
-We had a fight.
-About what?

18:13.967 --> 18:16.303
I get jealous sometimes.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.098
Do you think she's cheating on you?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.477
No, she would never.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.354
Then why do you get so angry?

18:25.437 --> 18:26.939
I didn't say I get angry.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.149
I said I get jealous.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.692
You're angry now, why?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.903
Because I don't like people judging me.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.196
I'm not judging you.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.157
No one here is judging you.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.620
Everyone here is judging me.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.083
You, Bette, Marsh,

18:47.459 --> 18:50.462
you all think I'd be so much happier
if I just fucked a dude.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.760
Bette doesn't think
Donna's good enough for you.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.183
She said that?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.853
To Marsh. I heard her.

19:14.486 --> 19:18.157
Yeah, well, she's wrong. I'm the one
who's not good enough for Donna.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.369
That burger made you
sick to your stomach, didn't it?

19:27.916 --> 19:31.044
There you are. Happy anniversary, you two.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.087
Hi, Bette.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.797
How are you on your special day?

19:47.311 --> 19:48.187
Order up.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.107
Is this right?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.775
Isn't that what he wanted?

19:53.859 --> 19:57.821
I usually enjoy being
right about the weather, but not today.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.742
The storms I predicted
are producing high winds and hail,

20:01.825 --> 20:04.036
which aren't totally unheard of
this time of year.

20:04.119 --> 20:07.497
It's just that, apparently,
they're coming down from the north now,

20:07.581 --> 20:09.333
instead of the storm fronts…

20:09.416 --> 20:10.584
Who are you texting?

20:12.127 --> 20:14.504
Shipping. They want the distro list.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.386
Give me that.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.971
Here we are.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.558
One spinach salad and one double-decker.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.942
Marsh, I salute you.

20:35.025 --> 20:38.904
Before you two leave, there's a young man
here interviewing at Vanguard today.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.030
His name is Mark.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.824
Mark. Mark, come. Meet my friends.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.205
Kate and Garry Fletcher, this is…

20:49.498 --> 20:51.833
Hi. Mark Brewer.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.543
Sorry to interrupt.

20:55.295 --> 20:59.383
Not at all. Bette says
you have an interview with us today.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.717
Yeah.

21:00.801 --> 21:04.596
I should probably get going.
I don't wanna be late for it.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.392
Don't go. We can do it here.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.396
You mean with you?

21:12.479 --> 21:13.647
Mmm-hmm.

21:13.730 --> 21:14.690
Kate?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.984
Bette speaks very highly of you.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.821
Please. Sit.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.409
Yeah.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.423
You're not gonna believe this.
I think I just got Mark a job at Vanguard.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.136
Marsh?

21:45.887 --> 21:47.514
Can you not even look at me?

21:48.557 --> 21:49.850
We're at work, Bette.

21:51.351 --> 21:55.480
Well… what about after work?

21:56.815 --> 21:59.526
You could come over, I can make us dinner.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.530
Is Bernard gonna be there?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.157
Probably.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.536
But Bernard likes you.
He actually talks when you come over.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.330
He doesn't talk when it's just me.

22:14.624 --> 22:18.378
And after dinner,
he'll go up to his room and…

22:20.630 --> 22:22.007
you could come to mine.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.056
I don't think that's a good idea.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.850
Why not?

22:34.936 --> 22:35.771
Marsh…

22:38.148 --> 22:39.149
I want to.

22:42.861 --> 22:43.737
Don't you?

22:48.575 --> 22:49.826
You don't want me, Bette.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.207
You're just bored and lonely
and I'm what's around right now.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.418
Why would you say that?

23:01.963 --> 23:03.006
It's okay.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.052
I'm not interested in you either.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.806
What, then…

23:10.889 --> 23:12.766
Then why do you keep comin' over?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.269
Because I like to have dinner
with you and Bernard.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.189
And have somebody else
to cook for a change.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.903
Then after dinner,
when you fall asleep in front of the TV…

23:27.656 --> 23:29.741
I like to go upstairs to your son's room.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.453
Bette, I like fucking him.

23:36.581 --> 23:40.127
-What?
-Yeah. Sometimes I let him fuck me.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.838
He's… he's just a kid.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.214
He's 21, Bette.

23:45.173 --> 23:48.927
And he knows what he's doing.
I didn't know shit when I was his age.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.940
Excuse me.

24:18.248 --> 24:20.876
Bette, you okay?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.129
I'm fine.
I'll be right out.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.133
Tell me about yourself.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.428
I graduated, um, three years ago.

24:31.511 --> 24:35.807
No, I know all that from your CV.
Tell me about you.

24:37.434 --> 24:41.855
Your life. Do you…
Are you married? Do you have kids?

24:41.938 --> 24:43.231
A girlfriend?

24:44.566 --> 24:49.779
I think I'm a few years away
from any girl wanting to… date me.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.073
Why do you say that?

24:52.157 --> 24:55.035
Because I'm unemployed,

24:55.702 --> 24:56.536
uh,

24:57.078 --> 25:00.874
I live in a shitty apartment
with, like… five roommates.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.504
I can barely take care of myself,
let alone somebody else.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.423
Isn't that a bit sexist?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.717
Not every girl needs taking care of.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.011
-Would you mind telling my mom that?

25:14.012 --> 25:16.598
And every girl I've ever dated.

25:16.681 --> 25:20.310
When I met Garry,
he was selling gym memberships.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.980
Now he's a VP at Vanguard.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.861
Yeah. It's cool that
you guys work together.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.906
Would you mind telling
my husband that?

25:34.282 --> 25:37.202
Turns out men don't actually
love taking orders from women.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.164
-Now who's being sexist?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.709
Some men love taking orders from women.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.345
Yeah, work's good, you know?

25:56.471 --> 25:57.722
Busy.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.016
Yeah, haven't seen you guys for a while.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.018
Yeah, Kate's got me on this diet.

26:05.021 --> 26:07.857
I don't get to the gym as often
as I used to, you know, with work.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.152
You're not gonna be on your deathbed
wishing you'd been to the gym more often.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.446
You know, that is very true.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.578
So, are you and Bette…

26:21.746 --> 26:22.622
No.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.625
She likes you though.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.627
Not anymore, she doesn't.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.547
Ah.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.258
Sorry to ruin your lunch.

26:33.341 --> 26:35.218
No, you didn't ruin my lunch.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.680
Kate did. She's auditioning the new me.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.099
He's just a kid.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.269
So was I.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.732
Shame about my burger though.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.026
You want me to make you a new one?

26:52.277 --> 26:54.070
-Can I eat it in here?
-Sure.

27:05.248 --> 27:10.003
-Oh, I'm sorry to make you wait.
-Oh, no, I… No, I was waiting for you.

27:12.005 --> 27:12.922
Are you okay?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.261
Is it Marsh?

27:19.804 --> 27:22.974
I… I see the way
you look at him sometimes, so--

27:23.058 --> 27:24.851
Oh, what is wrong with me?

27:25.560 --> 27:28.897
Nothing. If he broke up with you,
there's something wrong with him.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.149
He didn't break up with me.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.693
Apparently, we weren't even dating.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.404
Shit. I'm sorry.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.573
No. No, it's a good thing.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.367
Believe me.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.747
I should get back to work.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.211
Really? You gonna be
okay in there with Marsh?

27:57.926 --> 27:58.927
You know what?

28:00.470 --> 28:01.471
Fuck Marsh.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.567
He used to be really attractive.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.362
Uh, he's still a handsome guy.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.865
I guess I just know him now.

28:22.325 --> 28:25.829
God, what happens
once you get to know someone?

28:25.912 --> 28:27.288
Once you get to know Garry…

28:30.709 --> 28:34.671
He'll fuck anything… except me.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.050
Which is fine,

28:40.593 --> 28:42.512
because he's not very good at it.

28:47.350 --> 28:48.351
Are you?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.396
It's all about control with Kate.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.443
When I met her, I had nothing.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.781
She gave me everything,
but not because she loves me. No.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.951
So I won't leave, so she won't be alone.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.704
So people will think
she's lovable, but she's not.

29:09.914 --> 29:11.166
She's cold.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.626
She's perfect, and I'm not.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.589
I love to eat, drink, fuck.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.761
Kate doesn't like to do
any of those things.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.638
So, what do you do?

29:28.224 --> 29:31.102
When I'm with her, I'm a good boy.

29:32.937 --> 29:33.897
When I'm not…

29:36.232 --> 29:37.275
I'm pretty bad.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.904
How bad?

29:43.823 --> 29:46.201
Sometimes you just need to
get your dick sucked.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.621
-You know?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.374
Donna's lucky to have you.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.668
I don't know about that.

29:58.671 --> 30:00.131
I think we broke up last night.

30:01.382 --> 30:02.842
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.055
I know you don't like her.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.973
Well, that's not true. I just…

30:10.517 --> 30:12.310
I don't like her for you.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.480
You need someone you don't have to
take care of all the time.

30:16.481 --> 30:20.318
Someone positive and fun
who'll take care of you.

30:20.902 --> 30:24.948
Someone positive and fun… like, you?

30:26.032 --> 30:26.908
No.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.912
Or yes, I don't know.

30:31.746 --> 30:35.041
Someone who sees… how smart you are,

30:36.626 --> 30:38.336
and how beautiful. And…

30:49.138 --> 30:50.557
What'd you do that for?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.938
What is happening right now?

31:14.539 --> 31:15.957
Your husband can see us.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.627
He's gone.

31:24.632 --> 31:25.633
Everyone's gone.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.471
Do you miss them?

33:02.230 --> 33:04.607
The Vienna Zoo is reporting
that two giant pandas

33:04.691 --> 33:08.277
have successfully mated
after ten years of trying.

33:08.361 --> 33:13.324
Reports are that the pandas,
Bao Lin and Pai Gao, have mated

33:13.408 --> 33:16.995
after a decade-long courtship effort
by zoo staffers.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.624
Personally, I don't blame them
for not wanting to procreate

33:21.708 --> 33:25.878
since they are two of only about
two thousand pandas in existence…

33:38.474 --> 33:39.642
What if it's Donna?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.477
It's not.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.314
She never wants to see me again.

33:46.607 --> 33:47.734
You don't know that.

33:48.526 --> 33:49.610
I do.

33:51.571 --> 33:52.822
And I don't blame her.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.241
Why? What happened?

34:05.585 --> 34:06.586
I hit her.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.467
Last night when we were fighting…

34:14.802 --> 34:16.137
I hit her in the face.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.145
Hey, man, just… Just take it easy.

34:24.937 --> 34:26.898
-Think you're man enough for her, huh?
-Easy.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.484
-Let's see what you got.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.360
Garry, get off him!

34:31.444 --> 34:32.361
Not bad.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.075
You're not much of a fighter though.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.038
You're weak. You're fucking pathetic.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.248
You're perfect for her.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.423
Oh, my God!

34:53.549 --> 34:54.967
Oh, my God, Garry!

34:56.344 --> 34:57.887
I'm sorry.

34:57.970 --> 34:58.930
Garry?

35:00.389 --> 35:02.558
-What did you do?
-He attacked me.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.018
-You saw.
-Garry?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.770
You all saw, he tried to choke me.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.522
Somebody call an ambulance.

35:08.564 --> 35:13.277
I would never do anything to hurt anyone.
I would never. That's not who I am.

35:13.361 --> 35:17.657
…assaults, and random
senseless murders in a wave of violence

35:17.740 --> 35:19.700
that appears to be happening worldwide.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.160
I don't think it is you.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.246
I think it's him.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.415
Accidents
and disasters, traffic pileups,

35:26.499 --> 35:29.085
trains colliding, planes crashing.

35:31.087 --> 35:33.756
The governor has issued
a state of emergency…

35:33.840 --> 35:36.551
You said you were gonna change the world.
I didn't believe you.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.596
We're also
getting reports of gas line explosions

35:40.680 --> 35:42.974
and power grid failures
across the country.

35:43.766 --> 35:46.602
All I did was take away the lies.

35:46.686 --> 35:50.064
You all did the rest.
You did what you wanted to.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.607
I never wanted this.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.109
You didn't want to be seen,

35:54.777 --> 35:57.363
or touched, or loved?

35:59.574 --> 36:02.034
I didn't wanna kill anyone.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.204
Yes, you did.
Or you wouldn't have done it.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.000
Kate wanted to kill him too.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.293
I did not.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.754
You don't have to pretend anymore.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.966
You can have what you want.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.678
Put the knives down.

36:23.389 --> 36:26.184
Put the knives down.

36:30.813 --> 36:31.898
I offered you a world

36:31.981 --> 36:34.650
where you could be yourselves
without having to suffer for it,

36:34.734 --> 36:36.569
but it seems you enjoy your suffering.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.157
And if that is your truth,

36:42.992 --> 36:46.037
then perhaps your suffering
will set you free.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.542
The truth is a cleansing fire…

36:57.548 --> 37:01.719
which burns away
the lies we've told each other…

37:10.436 --> 37:14.482
and the lies we've told ourselves.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.500
So that love and hate,

37:33.626 --> 37:36.629
pleasure and pain…

37:42.760 --> 37:45.680
…can all be expressed…

37:49.350 --> 37:50.851
without shame.

37:53.729 --> 37:57.942
Where there is no good or bad…

38:02.196 --> 38:07.243
there is only the truth.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.720
…power grid failures
across the country.

38:25.803 --> 38:29.557
It seems the semitruck
carrying potassium hydroxide

38:29.640 --> 38:31.684
that Terri mentioned earlier

38:31.767 --> 38:35.271
was ignited in the middle of I-95

38:35.354 --> 38:39.025
after a group of people
stormed the police barricade

38:39.108 --> 38:40.484
and set it on fire.

38:41.444 --> 38:45.072
The explosion is said
to have caused a subsequent fire

38:45.156 --> 38:48.034
engulfing a number of cars and trucks,

38:48.117 --> 38:52.371
one of which
was a tanker truck carrying gasoline.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.876
Ninety-five is an inferno,

38:56.959 --> 38:59.962
and the high winds
are carrying burning hot ash

39:00.046 --> 39:01.881
into the surrounding neighborhoods.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.305
How is this a better world?

39:17.063 --> 39:19.190
You're still seeing it with your eyes.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.693
You need to close them.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.238
Embrace the darkness.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.165
I see the future.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.170
Then tell me.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.549
Tell me my future.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.012
You come from dust.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.682
You walk the dust.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.017
You go back to dust.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.646
That's everyone's future.
Tell me my future.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.816
There is no future for you, John Dee.

40:01.899 --> 40:06.862
It is bound by walls and guards
and the sour smell of madness.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.116
And then the skein of your life is cut,
son of your mother.

40:10.825 --> 40:14.120
No. Look again. Tell me my future.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.124
You have stolen
some of the power of Dream's.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.126
You will take all of it.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.379
You will crush
the Dream lord's life in your hands.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.067
Hello.

40:46.652 --> 40:47.778
I'm John.

40:49.071 --> 40:51.365
I'm glad you're here.
The power has gone out.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.870
So there's no TV,
and no one left to talk to.

40:55.953 --> 40:58.038
What is it you think you're doing?

40:59.665 --> 41:01.792
Saving the world from its lies.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.919
The ruby wasn't made for that.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.009
Oh, you're The Sandman.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.388
My mother was right.
She said you'd be coming for it.

41:14.472 --> 41:18.309
You must return it to me so that
I can repair the damage you have done.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.019
I'm not giving it to you, it's mine.

41:20.102 --> 41:24.273
It is harming you, John, and your world.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.025
It's revealing the truth.

41:27.776 --> 41:31.197
-This is the truth of mankind.
-No. You're wrong.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.284
This is the truth of mankind.

41:37.203 --> 41:41.749
-How's work going?
-Good, you know. Busy.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.334
They're lying to themselves.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.588
Garry's supervising a new venture
that looks promising.

41:47.671 --> 41:48.756
It's all lies.

41:48.839 --> 41:52.551
Not lies, John. Dreams.

41:52.635 --> 41:53.469
Right, sweetie?

41:53.552 --> 41:57.306
Kate dreams of running away,
where no one will find her.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.391
How are you, Bette?

42:00.267 --> 42:03.604
Garry dreams of proving
his father was wrong about him.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.980
How's Bernard doing?

42:05.064 --> 42:07.733
-How's your writing going?
-Yeah, how's the novel?

42:07.816 --> 42:08.943
Good, you know.

42:09.026 --> 42:13.697
Bette dreams of creating something
that matters to people.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.202
Their dreams inspired them.

42:18.994 --> 42:21.664
I thought I'd have more time to write
with Bernard off at college,

42:21.747 --> 42:24.416
but it's been great having him home, so…

42:24.500 --> 42:26.377
Their dreams kept them alive.

42:28.128 --> 42:30.297
But if you rob them of their dreams,

42:31.340 --> 42:36.303
if you take away their hope, then… yes,

42:37.721 --> 42:40.140
this is the truth of mankind.

42:42.184 --> 42:44.645
The ruby is hurting you, John.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.190
It has too much of my power within it.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.734
It stole more when I tried to use it.

42:51.652 --> 42:54.321
Then perhaps if I use it
to steal the rest of your powers,

42:54.405 --> 42:56.031
I will be the King of Dreams.

42:57.408 --> 43:02.204
If you'd rob a Dream lord of his power,
you shall do so in his realm.

43:04.748 --> 43:05.708
In dreams.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.432
Welcome home, Johnny.

44:48.352 --> 44:50.771
Don't be such a baby, Johnny.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.613
Go to sleep, Johnny.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.240
-Please.
-Mother?

45:01.323 --> 45:04.910
Johnny, you have to go to sleep.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.959
Your father was right.
I never should have had you.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.047
It's a dream!

45:18.507 --> 45:19.717
It's a dream.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.678
It's a dream.

45:50.038 --> 45:54.710
Is this your palace… Dream lord?

45:57.045 --> 46:01.759
Is this your throne… King of Lies?

46:03.385 --> 46:05.596
Well, it's mine now!

46:08.599 --> 46:09.808
Are you watching?

46:12.060 --> 46:13.687
Can you see me?

46:19.026 --> 46:23.280
Using your own powers
to burn away your lies?

46:23.363 --> 46:24.573
You must stop.

46:31.079 --> 46:33.415
It is not too late to save yourself.

46:33.499 --> 46:35.793
Oh, you think it's me that needs saving?

46:36.376 --> 46:40.923
Your father stole the ruby
from me and cursed you with it.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.051
You mean he blessed me with it.

46:48.680 --> 46:49.556
Your reign

46:51.683 --> 46:54.812
ended when my father captured you.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.773
Your kingdom

46:59.775 --> 47:01.276
is my birthright.

47:09.535 --> 47:13.121
Your power resides within me.

47:19.586 --> 47:23.590
How does it feel to know
I hold your life in my hands?

47:26.093 --> 47:29.596
You're hurting
the dreamers.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.224
Well, it's time they woke up!

47:35.644 --> 47:40.732
Your life and your lies end now.

48:02.546 --> 48:03.630
I did it.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.593
I killed him.

48:10.929 --> 48:11.972
I won.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.976
Thank you, John.

48:31.158 --> 48:32.576
But I killed you.

48:33.744 --> 48:37.497
You destroyed the ruby
and released the power inside it.

48:38.081 --> 48:39.875
I would never have thought of that.

48:41.084 --> 48:44.588
I'd forgotten just how much of myself
I had placed in the jewel.

48:45.964 --> 48:47.382
Are you going to kill me?

48:49.009 --> 48:49.968
I could.

48:51.678 --> 48:52.846
Perhaps I will.

48:55.766 --> 48:58.393
But the dream stone
was not made for mortals.

48:59.394 --> 49:01.772
And it came to you
through no fault of your own.

49:03.982 --> 49:06.944
So, no, John. I will not kill you.

49:09.863 --> 49:11.281
Sleep well, John.

49:38.850 --> 49:41.895
All the damage the ruby did,
can you undo it?

49:43.105 --> 49:44.523
The ruby didn't do this.

49:45.482 --> 49:50.529
John merely used it to reveal wounds
that were hidden, but never healed.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.491
Tomorrow, the rebuilding will begin.

49:56.034 --> 49:57.703
In this realm and in mine.

49:58.954 --> 50:00.205
But tonight at least…

50:02.833 --> 50:04.501
humanity will sleep in peace.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.441
I'm watching you…

50:29.609 --> 50:30.777
big brother.
