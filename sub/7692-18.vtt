13:00.811 --> 13:04.214
WELL, IF I TOLD YOU,
IT WOULDN'T BE A SURPRISE.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.316
JUST APPLAUD
WHEN THE LIGHTS COME UP.

13:06.316 --> 13:08.358
BUT WE PLANNED THIS TOGETHER!
WHAT--

13:08.358 --> 13:10.220
( sighs )

13:10.220 --> 13:12.322
HE'LL BE BACK.

13:21.131 --> 13:24.004
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
JUDGE ME?

13:27.207 --> 13:30.941
I'M TELLING YOU,
MARCUS IS PLAYING SOME KIND OF
TWISTED PSYCHOLOGICAL GAME,

13:30.941 --> 13:33.113
AND I CAN PROVE IT.

13:33.113 --> 13:36.286
EXHIBIT A: I LIFTED
A FINGERPRINT FROM HIS GUITAR.

13:36.286 --> 13:38.588
OH, THAT IS FANTASTIC, LEO.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.391
YOU PROVED THAT
WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT

13:41.391 --> 13:44.294
MARCUS'S GUITAR IS--
(gasps)--HIS.

13:46.356 --> 13:51.061
TRUE, BUT HE THEN
REMOVED SAID GUITAR
AND DELIBERATELY--

13:51.061 --> 13:53.563
DELIBERATELY, MIND YOU!--
SMASHED IT.

13:53.563 --> 13:56.466
EXHIBIT B:
PAINT CHIPS AND A HAIR.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.939
OOH.
 WHICH JUST HAPPENED
TO BE MY MOM'S.

13:58.939 --> 14:02.172
NONETHELESS... WE KNOW
 SHE DID NOT DO THIS.

14:04.144 --> 14:08.348
LEO, ARE YOU AFRAID THAT
BY US BEFRIENDING MARCUS

14:08.348 --> 14:10.250
THERE WON'T BE ANY ROOM
LEFT FOR YOU?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.851
WHAT? NO, ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.324
I'M AWESOME.
THAT GUY IS BAD NEWS.

14:14.324 --> 14:18.258
DON'T WORRY, LEO.
YOU'RE STILL OUR BEST FRIEND.

14:18.258 --> 14:22.092
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE A BEST FRIEND
UNLESS YOU HAVE A FRIEND
WHO'S A NOT BEST FRIEND.

14:22.092 --> 14:24.364
OKAY? SO HE DOES FILL A VOID.

14:26.436 --> 14:28.098
THAT'S NOT WHAT
THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

14:28.098 --> 14:30.340

14:36.977 --> 14:39.379
I MADE IT MY RINGTONE.

14:42.412 --> 14:45.255
WHY WON'T ANYONE BELIEVE ME?

14:45.255 --> 14:48.388
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MARCUS
IS SUCH A FANTASTIC LIAR.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.091
AND I RESPECT THAT.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.093
