00:10.185 --> 00:12.505
Have you had any thoughts
about what you'd like to do?

00:14.065 --> 00:15.465
For our 20th?

00:17.625 --> 00:19.425
Whatever you want is fine by me.

00:30.065 --> 00:32.785
Oh, Peter, you need to fix that tie.

00:34.905 --> 00:37.945
It's supposed to
hide the top button.

00:37.945 --> 00:39.785
The press will be there, remember.

00:39.785 --> 00:42.105
And I expect there'll
be quite a crowd.

00:42.105 --> 00:44.265
You love that, don't you?

00:44.265 --> 00:45.865
There you are. Much better.

01:00.385 --> 01:01.825
Can we get a move on, please?

01:01.825 --> 01:03.825
Oh, I don't know what
all the fuss is about.

01:03.825 --> 01:05.825
Not like you haven't
seen the guy before.

01:05.825 --> 01:07.705
Yeah, come on.

01:07.705 --> 01:09.145
Oh!

01:09.145 --> 01:10.425
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:12.225 --> 01:15.785
Leave it. Come on,
I'll buy you another one.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.265
Come on, come on.

01:23.185 --> 01:25.705
Come on.

01:29.265 --> 01:31.265
I think we should have a
small party at the house

01:31.265 --> 01:34.025
on our actual anniversary
with just a few friends...

01:34.025 --> 01:36.305
but we also need something
much more high profile.

01:36.305 --> 01:39.705
So I'm thinking,
maybe a gala dinner?

01:39.705 --> 01:41.865
Invite businesspeople,

01:41.865 --> 01:44.585
see if we can't get
a couple of celebrities

01:44.585 --> 01:46.545
and we'll send out
a press statement,

01:46.545 --> 01:48.145
I bet they'll be all over it.

01:52.705 --> 01:55.745
JOVIAL FOLK MUSIC

01:59.825 --> 02:01.825
Good turnout, eh?

02:01.825 --> 02:03.465
Yeah.

02:04.705 --> 02:07.585
I was really ready for that
ice cream. Only got one lick.

02:08.705 --> 02:11.785
Look, here he comes!

02:11.785 --> 02:14.265
Oi-oi!
CHEERING

02:14.265 --> 02:16.505
I told you there'd be a good crowd.

02:16.505 --> 02:18.225
You must be pleased.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.945
It's you they're here for.

02:19.945 --> 02:22.745
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

02:22.745 --> 02:24.345
Hello!

02:24.345 --> 02:25.865
Oh, no.

02:25.865 --> 02:27.625
He's got Cruella de Vil with him.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.865
I like her dress.

02:30.865 --> 02:32.185
Hey, PB.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.905
Hey, Mick. How you doing?
Good to see you.

02:40.145 --> 02:43.625
Well, hello, hello, thank you.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.505
This is a big day for us.

02:46.505 --> 02:47.865
PB's -

02:47.865 --> 02:50.145
that's me up there, by the way -

02:50.145 --> 02:51.705
has launched restaurants,

02:51.705 --> 02:53.865
well, all over the west coast

02:53.865 --> 02:55.705
but this one, here...

02:55.705 --> 02:57.745
Well, it's very special to us

02:57.745 --> 02:59.225
because it was our first.

03:01.185 --> 03:03.065
Re-launching a restaurant is...

03:03.065 --> 03:05.265
Well, it's like coming home.

03:05.265 --> 03:07.145
My dad was a trawlerman

03:07.145 --> 03:10.145
and he used to say, "Son..."

03:10.145 --> 03:13.105
He never could remember my name.
LAUGHTER

03:13.105 --> 03:16.225
He'd say, "Fishermen are a family.

03:17.425 --> 03:19.425
"We need each other.

03:19.425 --> 03:21.505
"Look out for each other."

03:21.505 --> 03:23.505
And that's what PB's is all about.

03:24.945 --> 03:26.025
We're a family.

03:28.865 --> 03:32.425
I would now like to hand over
to my lovely first wife,

03:32.425 --> 03:36.025
I call her that to
keep her on her toes,

03:36.025 --> 03:37.465
to cut the ribbon

03:37.465 --> 03:40.265
and declare this restaurant open.

03:40.265 --> 03:41.825
GUNSHOT

03:41.825 --> 03:43.705
PB!
SCREAMING

03:44.785 --> 03:47.145
Come here.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.225
Help!

04:17.545 --> 04:21.225
One minute, he was laughing and
joking - the next, it was terrible.

04:21.225 --> 04:22.385
It was terrible.

04:22.385 --> 04:24.385
Mum, drink this.

04:24.385 --> 04:26.185
His poor wife.

04:26.185 --> 04:28.385
She's not the one with a
bullet in her head, is she?

04:28.385 --> 04:30.785
Mick! What? My mum's upset.

04:30.785 --> 04:32.705
She's upset? He was MY mate.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.185
You hardly knew him.

04:34.185 --> 04:36.585
We went to the same school together.

04:36.585 --> 04:38.945
Yeah, he married money
but he never forgot his roots.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.425
Used to pop in here and play pool.

04:40.425 --> 04:41.625
Once in a blue moon.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.545
Will you two stop niggling?
Look, you've both had a shock.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.705
Shh, turn it up.

04:47.265 --> 04:48.905
A long-range shot.

04:48.905 --> 04:51.625
Now, obviously, we're pursuing
a number of lines of inquiry

04:51.625 --> 04:53.705
but, from the evidence so far,

04:53.705 --> 04:56.105
we believe Peter Bradshaw
was targeted

04:56.105 --> 04:58.265
by a highly trained professional.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.345
Thank you.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.265
Morning.

05:05.265 --> 05:06.425
Hiya.

05:06.425 --> 05:08.745
Just like Jackie Kennedy.

05:08.745 --> 05:11.145
Who's Jackie Kennedy?
Is she a relative?

05:11.145 --> 05:12.945
You frighten me sometimes.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.785
GP notes.

05:16.785 --> 05:18.785
He was diagnosed with depression

05:18.785 --> 05:23.305
and was on a prescription -
Mirtazapine and Amitriptyline.

05:23.305 --> 05:26.305
Poor man. He was
obviously very unhappy.

05:26.305 --> 05:27.705
KNOCK ON DOOR

05:27.705 --> 05:29.705
Come in.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.385
Mick, can I help you?

05:31.385 --> 05:32.625
You got a minute?

05:32.625 --> 05:34.225
Actually, I'm rather busy.

05:36.745 --> 05:39.425
Look, you and me,
I know there's no love lost.

05:39.425 --> 05:40.785
You've got that right.

05:42.305 --> 05:44.665
I'm here about PB.

05:44.665 --> 05:46.865
Ah! Here was me thinking
you were here about my mum.

05:46.865 --> 05:49.945
Your mum? Yeah, she's fine,
by the way. Thanks for asking.

05:49.945 --> 05:51.385
She's a tough old bird.

05:55.865 --> 05:57.305
How well did you know him?

05:59.065 --> 06:00.545
I know he wasn't happy.

06:00.545 --> 06:01.945
When did you last see him?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.305
A couple of weeks ago.

06:03.305 --> 06:05.465
He was in the pub
with some bloke. Who?

06:05.465 --> 06:08.305
No idea. But something wasn't right.

06:08.305 --> 06:09.505
Any idea what?

06:11.025 --> 06:14.105
If you ask me, that wife of
his kept him on a short leash.

06:14.105 --> 06:16.545
You think every married
man is on a short leash.

06:16.545 --> 06:18.785
That marriage was well dodgy.

06:18.785 --> 06:21.665
You want my advice,
start looking there.

06:21.665 --> 06:23.465
I know how to do my job, Mick.

06:23.465 --> 06:24.705
PHONE RINGS

06:24.705 --> 06:25.865
Excuse me.

06:28.385 --> 06:29.425
Jane Kennedy.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.905
Yes, I did get the report. 
Thank you.

06:32.905 --> 06:34.025
Hold on one second.

07:01.305 --> 07:02.585
Ma'am.

07:02.585 --> 07:04.505
Mrs Bradshaw,

07:04.505 --> 07:06.305
I'm Jane Kennedy, the coroner.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.185
I'm so sorry for your loss.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.385
I've already been over
everything with the police.

07:12.385 --> 07:13.785
I'm not the police.

07:13.785 --> 07:16.065
I just want to get the truth,
for your husband's sake.

07:16.065 --> 07:18.345
It won't bring him back, will it?

07:18.345 --> 07:19.945
It's natural to feel angry.

07:19.945 --> 07:22.105
How do you expect me to feel?

07:22.105 --> 07:24.225
We were happily married
for 20 years.

07:25.465 --> 07:28.265
According to his GP,
he was on antidepressants.

07:28.265 --> 07:30.505
Did you know?

07:30.505 --> 07:34.065
Of course I knew. We had no secrets.

07:34.065 --> 07:36.745
He suffered from depression,
so what?

07:36.745 --> 07:38.305
The impression I have is,

07:38.305 --> 07:40.305
Peter was very well liked but...

07:40.305 --> 07:42.185
do you know if he had any enemies?

07:42.185 --> 07:43.745
Where shall I start?

07:43.745 --> 07:45.225
The green-eyed monsters?

07:45.225 --> 07:46.545
The business rivals?

07:46.545 --> 07:48.745
Or the lunatics that
were making death threats?

07:48.745 --> 07:49.985
He'd had death threats?

07:49.985 --> 07:52.145
Sorry to disturb you
again, Mrs Bradshaw.

07:52.145 --> 07:53.865
I just wondered...

07:53.865 --> 07:55.905
Oh, hello.

07:55.905 --> 07:58.105
I wondered if you could
clear something up. What?

07:58.105 --> 08:00.545
Found this in your husband's
papers. It's a payment,

08:00.545 --> 08:04.785
for a rather large amount,
to a Jason Alexander.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.665
Diamonds.

08:06.665 --> 08:07.745
Sorry?

08:07.745 --> 08:09.265
Pink diamonds.

08:09.265 --> 08:10.785
For me.

08:10.785 --> 08:13.225
For our wedding anniversary.

08:13.225 --> 08:14.505
Next month.

08:18.225 --> 08:20.345
I think she's holding
something back.

08:20.345 --> 08:21.985
She's not the only one.

08:21.985 --> 08:26.105
Found Peter Bradshaw's mobile
phone hidden in his desk.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.265
Pay-as-you-go.
The call history's been wiped.

08:28.265 --> 08:29.585
She said they had no secrets.

08:29.585 --> 08:30.985
Yeah, right.

08:30.985 --> 08:32.544
She tell you anything else?

08:32.544 --> 08:35.745
She said he'd had death threats.
Yeah. Anonymous phone calls,

08:35.745 --> 08:37.865
people saying he
didn't deserve to live.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.345
There's nothing concrete though.
No demands.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.945
They just upped their
security and carried on.

08:42.945 --> 08:45.385
Listen, do you think you can
get anything else out of her?

08:45.385 --> 08:47.465
What? More than you, you mean?

08:47.465 --> 08:48.665
Oh, come on.

08:48.665 --> 08:51.225
Help me out here, Calamity, please.

08:51.225 --> 08:54.105
So, why would Peter Bradshaw
be targeted?

08:54.105 --> 08:56.545
So, you saw me on the TV last night?

08:56.545 --> 08:57.945
Yes.

08:57.945 --> 08:59.505
You scrub up well.

08:59.505 --> 09:00.825
Well, like I said,

09:00.825 --> 09:02.585
on the television,

09:02.585 --> 09:05.145
whoever he is, he's a real pro.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.825
Ballistics traced the shot to
a church tower across the water

09:07.825 --> 09:09.585
but there's no evidence
there, though.

09:09.585 --> 09:12.745
Apart from a trace of ice cream,
where he must've stood.

09:14.265 --> 09:16.345
Mick said something
about him marrying money.

09:16.345 --> 09:18.385
Yeah, it was her business.
PHONE RINGS

09:18.385 --> 09:21.545
He was bankrupt so he was
disqualified from being a director.

09:21.545 --> 09:22.985
Hello?

09:22.985 --> 09:25.025
Hello, Sylvie, love.

09:25.025 --> 09:26.625
No, that's all right, go on.

09:27.705 --> 09:30.185
Oh, right. OK. I'm on my way.

09:30.185 --> 09:32.545
Listen, something's come up,
I've got to go.

09:32.545 --> 09:35.705
Swing by the station later,
all right? I'll fill you in.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.265
Oh!
Will you look where you're going?

09:41.265 --> 09:43.305
I'm so sorry. Oh, gosh.

09:43.305 --> 09:44.625
It's all right.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.945
Can I buy you another one?

09:45.945 --> 09:47.265
I don't think so.

09:47.265 --> 09:49.705
This is a very expensive suit.

09:49.705 --> 09:52.025
No, I meant another coffee.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.545
No time. I better go and clean up.

09:54.545 --> 09:55.665
Sorry. Cheers.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.265
Am I in the right station?
Right, walk with me.

10:05.265 --> 10:07.585
Love the suit. Can't even
smell the mothballs.

10:07.585 --> 10:09.065
You must be getting a cold.

10:09.065 --> 10:10.905
I'm fronting a press conference. Oh?

10:10.905 --> 10:12.385
PB's is a huge business

10:12.385 --> 10:14.265
but they're seriously overfishing.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.065
So, they export
everything to Thailand

10:16.065 --> 10:18.225
where it's processed and
frozen by very cheap,

10:18.225 --> 10:19.905
some would say child labour.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.345
It's really dodgy stuff.

10:21.345 --> 10:24.065
But so are a lot of big companies,
so why would he be targeted?

10:24.065 --> 10:25.305
Well, we don't know.

10:25.305 --> 10:27.425
Could be that he's
just first on the list.

10:27.425 --> 10:30.665
International activist group,
eco-warriors, Thai business rivals,

10:30.665 --> 10:33.385
take your pick. I'm working
with Scotland Yard on this one

10:33.385 --> 10:36.305
so you'll have to take a back-seat -
but feel free to come and watch.

10:36.305 --> 10:37.865
Wait a minute.

10:40.705 --> 10:41.745
OK.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.945
Quiet now, please, everyone.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.625
Take your seats.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.625
Take a seat.

10:48.625 --> 10:49.985
Hello, everyone.

10:49.985 --> 10:52.785
I'm Detective Inspector Ben Marshall
from Scotland Yard.

10:52.785 --> 10:56.305
I'm going to be working closely
with South Dart Police on this case.

10:56.305 --> 10:59.945
I ask you to please understand this
is a high security investigation

10:59.945 --> 11:03.305
and I won't be answering
any specific questions.

11:03.305 --> 11:07.105
We believe that Peter Bradshaw
was targeted by an organised group

11:07.105 --> 11:09.465
and the public, at large,
is not at risk.

11:09.465 --> 11:12.505
Excuse me. Sorry,
I said no questions.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.105
As yet, no group has
claimed responsibility.

11:15.105 --> 11:16.825
They might go straight to you guys.

11:16.825 --> 11:19.305
In which case,
you ask for a password

11:19.305 --> 11:23.105
and you contact me immediately.
Everyone got that?

11:23.105 --> 11:25.425
Great. OK, folks.
Well, thanks very much.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.825
I believe there are some
refreshments in the next room

11:27.825 --> 11:29.825
so, please help yourselves.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.385
Sorry, this is my investigation,

11:33.385 --> 11:34.785
my press conference.

11:34.785 --> 11:37.345
Sergeant Higgins? That's right.

11:37.345 --> 11:39.025
I respect this is your gig

11:39.025 --> 11:41.425
but, when it comes to
international police work,

11:41.425 --> 11:43.465
best to leave it to the experts, OK?

11:43.465 --> 11:45.545
I'm bringing in a media officer.

11:45.545 --> 11:48.825
A Holmes team and an
Interpol liaison officer.

11:48.825 --> 11:51.025
Now, aren't you
going to introduce us?

11:52.305 --> 11:54.985
Oh, Jane Kennedy, coroner.

11:54.985 --> 11:57.585
Well, Jane Kennedy, coroner,

11:57.585 --> 12:01.585
you can buy me that cappuccino now.
PHONE RINGS

12:01.585 --> 12:03.665
DI Marshall.

12:03.665 --> 12:05.585
OK, tell them I'll be right there.

12:06.585 --> 12:08.665
Ballistics expert's just arrived.

12:10.505 --> 12:12.625
I'll take a raincheck
on that coffee.

12:21.425 --> 12:24.225
Davey's got Scotland Yard
and Interpol involved.

12:24.225 --> 12:27.145
He thinks it's to do with
his business methods abroad.

12:27.145 --> 12:29.345
Well, he's wrong.

12:29.345 --> 12:31.665
It's his personal life -

12:31.665 --> 12:33.865
but if Davey boy's getting
his rocks off

12:33.865 --> 12:35.585
hanging out with Interpol...

12:36.745 --> 12:39.185
Well, I guess that just leaves you.

12:39.185 --> 12:41.025
All right, Mick?

12:41.025 --> 12:43.665
You said something about his wife
keeping him on a short leash.

12:43.665 --> 12:45.225
What did you mean?

12:45.225 --> 12:47.985
Well, that business
came from her family.

12:47.985 --> 12:50.585
She controlled the money, and him.

12:50.585 --> 12:51.665
PB told you this?

12:51.665 --> 12:53.185
He didn't have to.

12:53.185 --> 12:54.625
One time, he bailed me out.

12:54.625 --> 12:55.705
Ten grand, he lent me.

12:55.705 --> 12:57.585
Peanuts to the likes of them

12:57.585 --> 13:01.265
but she came down and told me
not to ask PB for help any more.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.265
Reckoned that he was
a bit of a soft touch

13:05.265 --> 13:06.985
and I was a flyboy.

13:06.985 --> 13:10.265
Yeah, OK, I done a bit of ducking
and diving in my time

13:10.265 --> 13:11.945
but that cow... OK, point taken.

13:13.665 --> 13:15.345
Do you think he was faithful to her?

13:15.345 --> 13:16.825
How would I know?

13:16.825 --> 13:19.025
I'm just asking.

13:19.025 --> 13:21.705
Why? You think I set
him up with some girls?

13:21.705 --> 13:23.865
Is what you're getting at?

13:23.865 --> 13:25.265
I'm trying to help.

13:25.265 --> 13:26.465
By raking up dirt?

13:26.465 --> 13:28.185
You're unbelievable.

13:29.345 --> 13:30.865
Why do you put up with that oaf?

13:30.865 --> 13:32.305
Mostly for the sex.

13:32.305 --> 13:33.625
Oh, Mum.

13:35.025 --> 13:36.545
What did you make of PB?

13:36.545 --> 13:38.985
I never said more
than two words to him.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.945
I'm sorry, love, I wish I could
remember something useful for you,

13:41.945 --> 13:43.105
but I can't.

13:44.905 --> 13:47.305
Oh! Mmm.

13:47.305 --> 13:49.305
I just love this stuff.

13:49.305 --> 13:51.985
On the way to PB's,
I had a lovely big cone.

13:51.985 --> 13:53.705
Mick was in such a hurry
to get there,

13:53.705 --> 13:55.945
he made me drop it on
some poor guy's shoe

13:55.945 --> 13:57.945
and I felt really... Ow!

13:57.945 --> 13:59.225
Sorry.

13:59.225 --> 14:01.545
Try and remember,
Judith, love, please.

14:02.945 --> 14:05.305
He'd on a black T-shirt, I think.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.065
And sunglasses, didn't he, Mick?

14:09.065 --> 14:11.705
I don't know.
I never really looked at the guy.

14:11.705 --> 14:13.185
You saying that was him?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.385
Well, that's what I'm
trying to find out, yeah.

14:15.385 --> 14:18.105
How tall was he? My height?
Mick's height?

14:18.105 --> 14:20.345
Average, I think.

14:20.345 --> 14:21.705
And he had a hat -

14:21.705 --> 14:22.905
a baseball cap.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.345
Maybe.

14:24.345 --> 14:25.785
I never really looked at him,

14:25.785 --> 14:27.705
I was too busy looking at his shoe.

14:28.865 --> 14:30.625
It was black.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.225
I saw him and I did nothing.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.385
I think I'm going to be sick.

14:35.385 --> 14:36.905
Oh, Mick, don't. Judith!

14:36.905 --> 14:39.625
Judith! Judith!

14:44.385 --> 14:46.065
Briefing room. Ten minutes.

14:46.065 --> 14:47.345
Count me out.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.385
I've got a Skype call
with the Garda Siochana.

14:50.385 --> 14:52.305
That's the Irish
national crime agency...

14:52.305 --> 14:53.705
Yeah, I know who they are.

14:53.705 --> 14:55.665
What is their
connection to the case?

14:55.665 --> 14:57.105
Quite possibly none.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.545
I'm speaking to national crime
agencies all over the world.

15:13.265 --> 15:14.945
Hi, Annette.

15:14.945 --> 15:17.745
It's going to be another
late one, I'm afraid, love.

15:17.745 --> 15:19.665
No, I don't know when.

15:19.665 --> 15:22.305
No, no, no, I'll get
something from the canteen.

15:22.305 --> 15:24.025
No, don't wait up.

15:24.025 --> 15:25.985
All right, night then.

15:27.345 --> 15:29.865
SCREAMING

16:03.185 --> 16:04.985
So, fishing's in your blood?

16:04.985 --> 16:07.945
That's right. My father
was a trawlerman

16:07.945 --> 16:09.345
and his father before him.

16:09.345 --> 16:10.705
But you joined the Army?

16:10.705 --> 16:12.865
I had three great years.

16:12.865 --> 16:14.705
I made some good mates.

16:14.705 --> 16:17.385
In fact, I think there's
a reunion in a couple of months.

16:17.385 --> 16:19.265
Why did you leave?

16:19.265 --> 16:21.945
I met my wife while
I was home on leave.

16:21.945 --> 16:24.945
I think it was the
uniform that did it.

16:24.945 --> 16:25.985
You still got it?

16:27.745 --> 16:29.025
I...

16:31.265 --> 16:33.185
Sorry, what was the question again?

16:34.225 --> 16:36.225
Let's move on.

16:36.225 --> 16:39.865
From humble origins, you now
have a successful fishing company

16:39.865 --> 16:42.465
and a chain of restaurants
all over the Devon coastline.

16:42.465 --> 16:43.625
We do indeed.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.145
You're quoted as saying,
"We support local industry

16:46.145 --> 16:48.505
"and have brought hundreds
of jobs to the community."

16:48.505 --> 16:50.945
That's correct. Then why do you ship
your fish to Thailand

16:50.945 --> 16:53.225
to be gutted and frozen?

16:53.225 --> 16:55.665
Well, I mean, in these modern times,

16:55.665 --> 16:57.905
you have to think
globally as well as locally.

16:57.905 --> 16:59.825
So, are you thinking
globally or locally

16:59.825 --> 17:03.105
when you deplete the sea
of its natural resources...

17:03.105 --> 17:05.984
We're struggling to meet the
demands... ..and pollute the oceans?

17:05.984 --> 17:08.185
..and keep prices down.
So, you employ cheap labour?

17:08.185 --> 17:10.185
As I said... Slave labour?
No. Child labour?

17:11.185 --> 17:12.665
What? No.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.265
No, absolutely not.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.224
I strongly deny that.

17:16.224 --> 17:18.345
Yes, we have factories in Thailand,

17:18.345 --> 17:22.065
but I'm not involved in the
day-to-day running of...

17:22.065 --> 17:24.665
But I will look into it.

17:24.665 --> 17:26.545
I will. I will certainly do that.

17:28.265 --> 17:30.065
So, what do you think?

17:30.065 --> 17:32.465
Doesn't tell us anything
we don't already know, does it?

17:32.465 --> 17:35.465
I know that. Still, it's better than
the old bird with an ice cream cone.

17:35.465 --> 17:37.785
The chances are that
"old bird with the ice cream cone"

17:37.785 --> 17:39.705
may have seen the killer that day.
So what?

17:39.705 --> 17:42.465
He'd have been on a plane within
a couple of hours of the shooting.

17:42.465 --> 17:45.745
You can't say that. For all
we know, he could still be here.

17:45.745 --> 17:46.985
Listen, Dave.

17:46.985 --> 17:48.625
There are two kinds of hit men.

17:48.625 --> 17:51.225
The local thug, who'll knock
somebody off for 100 quid,

17:51.225 --> 17:54.705
and the real pro, who can name his
price and works all over the world -

17:54.705 --> 17:56.345
like our guy.

17:56.345 --> 17:58.745
We're working at an international
level,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.225
looking for patterns,

18:00.225 --> 18:01.505
connections,

18:01.505 --> 18:03.425
MOs of known assassins.

18:03.425 --> 18:05.145
Not the kind of door-to-door,

18:05.145 --> 18:07.345
good cop/bad cop
scene you're used to.

18:09.185 --> 18:12.145
No-one's claimed responsibility
yet though, have they?

18:12.145 --> 18:13.545
No.

18:13.545 --> 18:16.065
And have you managed to
establish any "patterns"

18:16.065 --> 18:17.945
that would suggest a known assassin?

18:17.945 --> 18:19.825
Not yet, no. No.

18:19.825 --> 18:21.905
No leads from the Garda Siochana?

18:21.905 --> 18:24.585
Or any of the other
international crime agencies?

18:24.585 --> 18:25.785
Not yet.

18:25.785 --> 18:27.585
No. Well, let me know when you do.

18:27.585 --> 18:29.905
And let me remind you that
it is the local police

18:29.905 --> 18:32.305
that are in charge
of this investigation.

18:35.145 --> 18:36.785
Dave, actually, there is

18:36.785 --> 18:39.265
one bit of local knowledge
that would be really helpful.

18:39.265 --> 18:42.425
Yeah. What's that? That hot coroner.
Is she available?

18:47.505 --> 18:49.745
I will look into it.

18:49.745 --> 18:52.465
I will. I certainly will do that.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.305
And Ben Marshall dismissed this?

18:54.305 --> 18:57.105
Yeah. Mr Big Shot from the Met.

18:57.105 --> 18:59.105
This is huge. You think so?

18:59.105 --> 19:00.945
These guys are flirting.

19:00.945 --> 19:03.185
Oh, come on. You got my hopes up
for a minute.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.905
No, seriously, look, I'll show you.

19:06.905 --> 19:08.145
Have you still got it?

19:09.705 --> 19:11.065
I...

19:13.065 --> 19:16.025
Sorry, what was the question again?

19:16.025 --> 19:18.945
Mick, is this the
guy you saw with PB?

19:18.945 --> 19:20.185
Nope.

19:20.185 --> 19:21.505
But you knew he was gay?

19:23.785 --> 19:26.105
Mick, you're not helping
by holding things back.

19:26.105 --> 19:27.465
What difference does it make?

19:27.465 --> 19:30.425
Well, I think it would
make a difference to his wife.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.545
Is this a bad time?

19:52.545 --> 19:54.985
I was just...sorting
through my husband's things

19:54.985 --> 19:56.425
to send to charity.

20:01.385 --> 20:03.985
How dare this young man harass
my husband like this?

20:03.985 --> 20:06.185
Do you know him? No, I do not.

20:06.185 --> 20:09.665
So, you've never
seen him before? No.

20:09.665 --> 20:10.865
Why did you show me this?

20:10.865 --> 20:11.985
I'm sorry if it upset you

20:11.985 --> 20:14.265
but your husband
rarely gave interviews.

20:14.265 --> 20:15.905
Why do you think
he agreed to this one?

20:15.905 --> 20:17.105
You'd have to ask him that.

20:17.105 --> 20:18.585
Oh, but you can't, can you?

20:18.585 --> 20:20.785
On account of him being dead.

20:20.785 --> 20:23.385
Your husband said something
about an Army reunion.

20:23.385 --> 20:25.585
What? In the interview.
Do you know if he went?

20:25.585 --> 20:26.745
Why would he?

20:26.745 --> 20:28.305
He was in the Army for five minutes.

20:28.305 --> 20:31.425
He has nothing in common
with these people. Nothing.

20:38.065 --> 20:39.545
You've got a visitor.

20:40.585 --> 20:42.865
So, this is where you hang out?

20:42.865 --> 20:44.745
I see you got the stain out.

20:44.745 --> 20:45.985
Thought you'd be pleased.

20:45.985 --> 20:48.265
Will you let me pay
for the dry cleaning?

20:48.265 --> 20:50.705
Only if you let me
take you out for dinner.

20:50.705 --> 20:52.545
Well, I... Give me your phone.

20:52.545 --> 20:54.465
What for? Just give me your phone.

20:58.745 --> 21:00.425
Let's do it tonight, OK?

21:01.985 --> 21:03.785
PHONE BEEPS

21:03.785 --> 21:06.385
Now I've got your number.

21:06.385 --> 21:09.185
I'll make a reservation
and get back to you.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.345
See you later.

21:16.945 --> 21:19.065
Plonker.

21:19.065 --> 21:21.265
You're not really going
to go out with him, are you?

21:21.265 --> 21:23.465
Clint! What?

21:23.465 --> 21:24.705
See what you can find out

21:24.705 --> 21:26.705
about a recent reunion
for PB's old regiment.

21:26.705 --> 21:29.065
OK, but do you still want this?

21:29.065 --> 21:30.665
Want what? This.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.105
The interview guy.

21:34.425 --> 21:35.745
Yes.

21:35.745 --> 21:38.185
It should never have been online.

21:38.185 --> 21:40.265
It was the camera guy.

21:40.265 --> 21:41.625
I'm furious about it.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.985
I promised Peter it was
for academic purposes only.

21:43.985 --> 21:45.385
It was part of my PhD research.

21:45.385 --> 21:46.705
And now, this.

21:48.585 --> 21:51.345
Sorry, I still can't
take in what's happened.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.785
You and Peter were close?

21:54.785 --> 21:57.505
They're saying it was some kind
of activist group or something?

21:57.505 --> 21:59.785
That's one line of inquiry.
The police were asking me

21:59.785 --> 22:02.425
if I was involved with any
radical political organisations.

22:02.425 --> 22:04.585
I'm not the police, Michael.
I won't ask you that.

22:04.585 --> 22:06.145
Like I would set Peter up.

22:06.145 --> 22:09.905
I never showed that interview
to anyone apart from my supervisor.

22:14.825 --> 22:16.705
Oh, wow!

22:16.705 --> 22:18.105
Vinyl.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.625
Cool. Do you mind if I...? Yeah.

22:20.625 --> 22:23.185
Oh, mate.

22:23.185 --> 22:25.745
Oh, Miles Davis.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.105
You like Miles Davis?

22:27.105 --> 22:30.305
The guy who invented cool?

22:30.305 --> 22:32.225
Don't you think he
sounds better on vinyl?

22:32.225 --> 22:35.105
Don't you think everything
sounds better on vinyl?

22:37.945 --> 22:39.425
JANE CLEARS THROAT

22:39.425 --> 22:41.265
Sorry. Where were we?

22:42.825 --> 22:44.705
Were you and Peter close?

22:44.705 --> 22:45.905
We were, actually.

22:45.905 --> 22:47.145
We became friends.

22:48.265 --> 22:52.385
Watching you together, I thought,
perhaps, you were more than friends.

22:53.785 --> 22:55.345
Maybe, but...

22:57.225 --> 22:59.585
I never set out to come
between him and his wife.

22:59.585 --> 23:01.385
Did you know her?

23:01.385 --> 23:03.785
I met her once. I came by
the office and she was there.

23:03.785 --> 23:05.705
She asked Peter to introduce us.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.665
She seemed a perfectly
nice woman. Why?

23:11.585 --> 23:14.065
I think there's more
you're not telling me.

23:17.025 --> 23:20.585
If there is, I can't see
how it could help Peter.

23:20.585 --> 23:23.265
It might help you...to tell someone.

23:24.665 --> 23:27.265
This must be a very hard
time for you right now.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.865
I loved Peter, I really did,

23:32.865 --> 23:35.345
but I wasn't in love with him.

23:35.345 --> 23:37.905
I wish I could've been,
but I just wasn't.

23:37.905 --> 23:39.425
But he was in love with you?

23:40.705 --> 23:43.865
I didn't mean for it to happen but,

23:43.865 --> 23:45.585
yeah, he left his wife.

23:45.585 --> 23:49.625
He wanted us to live together -
to be together but...

23:49.625 --> 23:52.585
But I never meant things
to go that far, so I ended it.

23:53.705 --> 23:55.985
And he went back to his wife?

23:55.985 --> 23:58.545
I think it was the best
thing for both of them.

24:00.145 --> 24:04.705
Look, there's no reason for
anyone to know this, is there?

24:04.705 --> 24:07.785
I mean, like, that
woman's lost her husband.

24:08.785 --> 24:10.625
At least let her keep her pride.

24:14.225 --> 24:17.785
So there's the guy with
a knife in his chest, yeah?

24:17.785 --> 24:20.185
Blood everywhere,

24:20.185 --> 24:24.025
and this singing, so we follow it

24:24.025 --> 24:25.985
and there's another guy,

24:25.985 --> 24:27.865
on a bed, blind drunk,

24:27.865 --> 24:29.545
completely covered in blood

24:29.545 --> 24:32.265
and guess what he was singing?

24:32.265 --> 24:33.465
No idea.

24:33.465 --> 24:36.225
♪ I did it my way. ♪

24:36.225 --> 24:38.385
HE LAUGHS

24:40.905 --> 24:43.825
So, what kind of person
becomes a sniper?

24:43.825 --> 24:45.705
You mean outside the forces?

24:45.705 --> 24:48.385
I mean, that could kill a
total stranger in cold blood.

24:48.385 --> 24:49.905
It's a job.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.665
He's not thinking about the person,

24:51.665 --> 24:53.985
he's thinking about wind speed,

24:53.985 --> 24:55.665
movement of target,

24:55.665 --> 24:57.425
means of escape.

24:57.425 --> 25:00.505
And we can tell - from things
like where the shot was fired,

25:00.505 --> 25:03.465
distance, accuracy, bullet fall -

25:03.465 --> 25:07.945
how well trained the sniper
is and maybe even who.

25:07.945 --> 25:10.105
In this case?

25:10.105 --> 25:12.305
No idea. Brick wall, I'm afraid.

25:17.545 --> 25:20.985
So, Jane Kennedy, I hear
you've just moved back to the area.

25:22.985 --> 25:24.305
Yeah, that's right.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.065
I'm living with my mum.

25:26.065 --> 25:28.505
Oh, must be a bit
awkward for the love life.

25:28.505 --> 25:30.385
Well, not really, I'm not actually...

25:30.385 --> 25:32.265
Well, as luck would have it,

25:32.265 --> 25:34.665
my hotel is very close

25:34.665 --> 25:36.905
and I have a rather nice room.

25:36.905 --> 25:38.625
So how about we finish...
PHONE RINGS

25:38.625 --> 25:40.625
Sorry.

25:40.625 --> 25:42.665
Hi, Mum, is everything all right?

25:42.665 --> 25:44.065
It's me.

25:44.065 --> 25:45.425
Are you OK?

25:45.425 --> 25:49.425
Listen, I got the info
on that Army reunion...

25:49.425 --> 25:50.945
and some pictures.

25:50.945 --> 25:54.545
No, it's all right. Try not to worry,
I'm on my way home.

25:54.545 --> 25:55.625
Hello?

25:55.625 --> 25:58.225
My mum's had a fall. I've got to go.
I'm sorry. I'll drive you.

25:58.225 --> 26:01.025
No, no. I have the car.
Finish your dinner. Sorry.

26:07.305 --> 26:11.105
LOUD MOANING FROM UPSTAIRS

26:18.985 --> 26:21.145
Jane, is that you?

26:21.145 --> 26:23.105
Jane?

26:23.105 --> 26:24.625
I wasn't expecting you till later.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.985
I don't believe this.
What if Beth had walked in?

26:26.985 --> 26:28.785
She's at a sleepover, remember?

26:28.785 --> 26:30.345
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

26:30.345 --> 26:31.785
What happened to your date?

26:31.785 --> 26:33.225
It wasn't a date.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.625
It was just, you know...
KNOCK ON DOOR

26:35.625 --> 26:36.985
Oh, don't say he followed me.

26:36.985 --> 26:38.945
Mum, just go back in the
room and stay there.

26:38.945 --> 26:40.545
All right, with pleasure.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.625
What are you doing here? You OK?

26:45.625 --> 26:47.265
You were weird on the phone.

26:47.265 --> 26:48.905
Oh, yeah, sorry about that. Come in.

26:48.905 --> 26:50.105
It was just a...

26:50.105 --> 26:51.625
Escape call?

26:51.625 --> 26:54.945
Yeah. Good timing. Thanks, Clint.
That bad, was it?

26:54.945 --> 26:58.145
Are those the photos?
Yeah, here they are.

26:58.145 --> 27:01.185
Mick, can you just come down
here a minute, please?

27:01.185 --> 27:02.545
Come in.

27:11.225 --> 27:14.785
Can you look at these and
tell me if you recognise any of them?

27:14.785 --> 27:16.665
PB...

27:16.665 --> 27:17.985
Him.

27:17.985 --> 27:20.345
That's the guy I saw him with.

27:20.345 --> 27:21.505
Are you sure?

27:21.505 --> 27:23.385
Dead sure. Great.

27:23.385 --> 27:25.905
Clint, see what you
can find out about him.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.305
Yeah.

27:27.305 --> 27:29.745
I'm on it. Thanks.

27:29.745 --> 27:31.785
Sorry, mate. Cheers.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.305
All right.

27:40.025 --> 27:41.265
Morning.

27:41.265 --> 27:43.065
Hey. Take a look at this.

27:44.145 --> 27:46.185
Brian Digsby, AKA Digger.

27:46.185 --> 27:49.105
He's got a boat repair shop
over in Lansdowne Bay.

27:49.105 --> 27:50.625
Mick said he saw PB talking to him

27:50.625 --> 27:52.305
in the Black Dog a few weeks ago,

27:52.305 --> 27:54.025
said it looked pretty serious.

27:54.025 --> 27:55.505
I thought I saw you come in.

27:55.505 --> 27:56.745
Hello.

27:56.745 --> 27:59.585
Shame dinner was cut short
last night. I know. I'm sorry.

27:59.585 --> 28:01.505
We'll have to fix up a re-match.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.185
Can we talk about this later?

28:05.465 --> 28:07.625
Certainly can.

28:10.025 --> 28:12.065
Can't believe you went
out with that pillock.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.545
Will you stop going on about it?

28:13.545 --> 28:16.585
What did you see in him? His charm?
His personality? His good looks?

28:16.585 --> 28:19.745
I wouldn't say he's good looking.
Oh, he is. You ask him.

28:20.825 --> 28:23.545
SAW WHIRS

28:26.025 --> 28:28.865
Brian Digsby?

28:28.865 --> 28:29.905
Brian?

28:30.945 --> 28:33.225
What? Brian Digsby?

28:33.225 --> 28:34.625
Digger. Yes?

28:34.625 --> 28:35.825
I'm Jane Kennedy.

28:35.825 --> 28:39.585
I'm the coroner for Peter Bradshaw.
This is Detective Sergeant Higgins.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.865
Sorry. I just need to finish this.

28:41.865 --> 28:44.225
We understand you were a
friend of Peter Bradshaw's.

28:44.225 --> 28:45.705
Not really.

28:45.705 --> 28:47.905
We were in the Army together,
way back.

28:47.905 --> 28:49.705
But you saw him recently?

28:49.705 --> 28:50.905
That's right.

28:50.905 --> 28:52.425
Can you tell us anything about him?

28:52.425 --> 28:53.745
Like what?

28:53.745 --> 28:55.185
How did he seem to you?

28:56.705 --> 28:58.705
Rich.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.545
I meant his state of mind.

29:00.545 --> 29:01.985
Last time you saw him,

29:01.985 --> 29:03.465
did he confide anything in you?

29:03.465 --> 29:06.025
Like what? This is a murder inquiry,
my friend.

29:06.025 --> 29:09.225
At least have the decency to come
down here and speak to us, please.

29:11.745 --> 29:12.945
Thank you.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.865
Now, you were seen together
in the Black Dog,

29:22.865 --> 29:25.905
having a serious discussion.
About what?

29:25.905 --> 29:28.145
My wife died last year.

29:28.145 --> 29:30.105
We were talking about that.

29:30.105 --> 29:31.185
I'm sorry.

29:31.185 --> 29:33.025
How long were you in the Army?

29:33.025 --> 29:34.625
15 years.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.105
And then?

29:36.105 --> 29:37.545
Lived abroad.

29:37.545 --> 29:39.825
Had a boatyard in Angola.

29:39.825 --> 29:41.905
I came back here
when my wife died.

29:41.905 --> 29:45.305
Why? Where were you on the 14th,
between 10 and 12?

29:45.305 --> 29:46.785
The 14th?

29:46.785 --> 29:47.905
Yeah.

29:47.905 --> 29:49.225
It was the day PB was shot.

29:49.225 --> 29:50.665
In hospital.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.225
Acute coronary syndrome.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.905
I saw it on the news,

29:56.905 --> 29:58.625
in the ward.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.585
It's a terrible business.

30:11.265 --> 30:13.505
Well, that was a
waste of time, wasn't it?

30:13.505 --> 30:16.185
Like you'd go for a drink with
someone you're about to bump off.

30:16.185 --> 30:18.865
You might do, cos you'd have
to get to know him, his routines.

30:18.865 --> 30:20.545
OK, so you're an expert
on snipers now,

30:20.545 --> 30:23.185
since you been hanging
out with Ben Marshall?

30:23.185 --> 30:25.345
I think Brian Digsby's
holding something back.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.065
HE SCOFFS
What? You always say that.

30:27.065 --> 30:29.425
And I have to tell you, it's
not helpful. Oh, excuse me.

30:29.425 --> 30:31.825
Maybe if you'd some idea about
what's being held back...

30:31.825 --> 30:33.785
PHONE RINGS
..that would be worth saying.

30:33.785 --> 30:35.345
Hello? Yeah.

30:36.785 --> 30:38.265
How much?

30:39.545 --> 30:40.625
Yeah, all right, OK.

30:40.625 --> 30:41.825
When was this?

30:43.945 --> 30:45.345
All right, I'm on my way.

30:47.265 --> 30:49.825
I've had someone look
into Joy Bradshaw's finances.

30:49.825 --> 30:51.145
Is that legal?

30:51.145 --> 30:52.785
I call it the Ways and Means Act.

30:52.785 --> 30:54.785
Four weeks before her
husband was killed,

30:54.785 --> 30:57.025
she withdrew ã100,000 in cash.

30:57.025 --> 30:59.105
Hold on. Don't start
jumping to conclusions.

30:59.105 --> 31:01.745
I won't. Just because you're
desperate to get... Get what?

31:01.745 --> 31:04.265
Get a break in this case.
Please don't overreact. I won't.

31:04.265 --> 31:06.505
Promise me. I won't.

31:06.505 --> 31:08.505
I'll ask you again,
what was the money for?

31:08.505 --> 31:09.785
I refuse to answer that.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.185
Quite convenient for you,
wasn't it, Mrs Bradshaw,

31:12.185 --> 31:13.785
your husband's death?

31:13.785 --> 31:15.545
Your marriage is a sham. He's gay.

31:15.545 --> 31:16.705
He's having an affair.

31:16.705 --> 31:18.905
You're this high up in
dodgy business practices -

31:18.905 --> 31:21.385
but, with him out of the way,
all your problems are solved.

31:21.385 --> 31:23.585
This is outrageous. Really, you
think so?

31:23.585 --> 31:26.225
A woman in your position?
Money, connections.

31:26.225 --> 31:28.745
I'd have thought paying
someone to do your dirty work

31:28.745 --> 31:31.185
is just par for the course.
Mrs Bradshaw, I'm so sorry.

31:31.185 --> 31:32.745
Imogen? What took you so long?

31:32.745 --> 31:35.345
This is Imogen Beaton,
Mrs Bradshaw's solicitor.

31:35.345 --> 31:37.865
If you'd like to wait in my
office, I'll be with you shortly.

31:37.865 --> 31:39.785
Could you organise some coffee,
constable?

31:39.785 --> 31:42.265
What do you think you're doing?
Don't thank me. What for?

31:42.265 --> 31:44.425
Stopping this fiasco
while you've still got a job.

31:44.425 --> 31:46.785
Now, you listen to me, Marshall.
INSPECTOR Marshall.

31:46.785 --> 31:48.025
And you listen to me,

31:48.025 --> 31:51.665
that woman is so well connected,
she could end your career like that.

31:51.665 --> 31:54.625
Or what's left of it, Sergeant.

32:05.345 --> 32:07.865
Mrs Bradshaw.
What are you doing here?

32:07.865 --> 32:09.265
If you must know,

32:09.265 --> 32:12.025
I've been hauled into this
station like a common criminal.

32:12.025 --> 32:13.745
That must have been
difficult for you.

32:13.745 --> 32:16.025
Can you tell me when
this will be over...

32:16.025 --> 32:18.105
so I can bury my husband
with some dignity?

32:18.105 --> 32:20.505
I don't know. We're all
very keen to resolve it.

32:20.505 --> 32:21.745
Oh, please.

32:21.745 --> 32:23.065
You're all loving it.

32:23.065 --> 32:25.345
Getting to see how
the other half live.

32:25.345 --> 32:28.225
Why did you lie to me
about knowing Michael Larkin?

32:30.025 --> 32:32.585
Why do you think?

32:32.585 --> 32:35.265
To protect my husband's memory.

32:35.265 --> 32:36.905
So, he made a mistake,

32:36.905 --> 32:39.265
but we were back together,
stronger than ever.

32:39.265 --> 32:41.865
The money you withdrew before
he was killed? ã100,000.

32:41.865 --> 32:43.985
What was it for? I don't
have to explain myself.

32:43.985 --> 32:45.985
Under the circumstances,
I'm afraid you do.

32:45.985 --> 32:47.425
It's a very large sum of money.

32:47.425 --> 32:48.905
To you, maybe.

32:48.905 --> 32:51.585
To me, it's a
day's shopping in Paris.

32:51.585 --> 32:52.905
A day's shopping in Paris?

32:52.905 --> 32:54.385
Nice. If that rich bitch thinks...

32:54.385 --> 32:57.105
You promised you wouldn't overreact.
..her money can protect her.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.705
Bringing a suspect in for
questioning is not overreacting.

32:59.705 --> 33:02.185
For all the good it's done you.
Joy Bradshaw has clammed up

33:02.185 --> 33:05.305
and you're no further forward in the
case. Well, neither's Ben Marshall.

33:05.305 --> 33:07.745
And you're pleased about that?
This is my investigation.

33:07.745 --> 33:09.945
He's been undermining me
every chance he can get.

33:09.945 --> 33:11.825
It's not fair. How old are you, 12?

33:11.825 --> 33:13.985
You didn't hear the way
he spoke to me. Get over it.

33:13.985 --> 33:16.985
Oh, right, I should've known you'd
take his side. It's not about sides.

33:16.985 --> 33:18.025
I've got a job to do.

33:18.025 --> 33:20.585
A deeply unhappy man has been
killed and I want to know why.

33:20.585 --> 33:23.225
And I don't? I didn't say that.
No, there's a lot you don't say.

33:23.225 --> 33:25.905
Not interrupting anything, am I?

33:25.905 --> 33:27.305
No, we're done here.

33:31.585 --> 33:33.545
Maybe you should stay here
and I storm out.

33:34.745 --> 33:36.545
Am I missing something?

33:36.545 --> 33:37.905
No.

33:37.905 --> 33:40.145
How's your mum? Fine, why?

33:40.145 --> 33:41.665
So she wasn't badly hurt?

33:41.665 --> 33:42.945
What?

33:42.945 --> 33:44.225
When she fell?

33:44.225 --> 33:45.825
Yes. No, she wasn't.

33:45.825 --> 33:47.705
I mean, hurt. She wasn't badly hurt.

33:47.705 --> 33:49.065
Bit of advice.

33:49.065 --> 33:51.865
It's a good idea to keep
track of the lies you tell.

33:53.905 --> 33:56.145
I'm sorry, Ben.

33:56.145 --> 33:57.865
Thing is, I'm just
out of a relationship

33:57.865 --> 34:00.225
and I'm nowhere near ready
to get involved with anyone.

34:00.225 --> 34:01.785
Involved?

34:01.785 --> 34:03.385
I was only after a bit of fun.

34:04.945 --> 34:06.505
Your loss.

34:19.465 --> 34:21.745
JANE: People are getting at
each other's throats.

34:21.745 --> 34:24.545
Nobody's getting anywhere and
I don't know what my next move is.

34:32.705 --> 34:34.625
You know, my dad was a trawlerman.

34:35.745 --> 34:39.225
He was a rotten husband,
a rotten dad,

34:39.225 --> 34:41.705
but he loved his fellow fishermen.

34:46.264 --> 34:48.385
What happened to you, Peter?

34:51.185 --> 34:54.425
You ended up with a huge company
you had no control over.

34:56.264 --> 34:58.305
Someone wanted you dead.

35:04.585 --> 35:06.985
I don't know who,
I don't know why.

35:09.225 --> 35:11.025
I'm sorry I can't help you.

35:32.225 --> 35:36.345
Hello, this is DS Higgins
from South Dart Constabulary.

35:36.345 --> 35:38.785
I was just wondering if you could
have someone call me back

35:38.785 --> 35:41.385
through the switchboard
please, if that's possible?

35:41.385 --> 35:44.785
Yeah. It doesn't matter how late,
it's very important.

35:44.785 --> 35:46.225
All right, much obliged.

36:31.825 --> 36:33.825
Nice one.

36:55.305 --> 36:56.705
You come to apologise?

36:58.385 --> 37:00.345
You first.

37:00.345 --> 37:03.305
Listen, you'll never guess...
Did we ever find those diamonds? Eh?

37:03.305 --> 37:05.065
The ones PB bought
before he was killed.

37:05.065 --> 37:07.625
Joy was searching for...
It's not important. Look at this.

37:07.625 --> 37:10.185
You know you said Digger
was holding something back?

37:10.185 --> 37:12.385
So you do listen to me then?

37:12.385 --> 37:14.505
Come and have a look at this.

37:14.505 --> 37:16.065
I've checked his Army records.

37:16.065 --> 37:18.145
He's had specialist training.

37:18.145 --> 37:19.705
Sniper.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.185
Experienced in the field.

37:22.185 --> 37:24.305
The only thing is,
his alibi checks out.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.385
Hold on, let's think about this.

37:37.185 --> 37:40.825
Hello. Can you put me through to
the coronary care unit, please?

37:44.185 --> 37:45.745
I've told you everything.

37:45.745 --> 37:47.145
No, not quite.

37:47.145 --> 37:48.585
You see, that discussion you had

37:48.585 --> 37:50.305
with Peter Bradshaw
in the Black Dog,

37:50.305 --> 37:52.185
a witness has come forward.

37:52.185 --> 37:53.945
You were overheard.

37:53.945 --> 37:55.345
It's just talk.

37:55.345 --> 37:57.185
I checked your Army records.

37:57.185 --> 37:59.225
So? You were a highly
trained soldier.

37:59.225 --> 38:00.705
I was, in my time.

38:00.705 --> 38:02.265
How's your heart?

38:02.265 --> 38:03.545
Fine, thank you.

38:03.545 --> 38:05.985
Got a check-up in three months.

38:05.985 --> 38:07.465
You want to see the card?

38:07.465 --> 38:09.065
Can't be too careful with hearts.

38:09.065 --> 38:12.305
Just mention chest pains
and they'll admit you for tests.

38:12.305 --> 38:14.545
Thing is, once you get there,
they dump you in a ward

38:14.545 --> 38:17.785
and you can hang around
for the rest of the day.

38:17.785 --> 38:20.985
No-one would know if
you slipped out for an hour.

38:20.985 --> 38:23.105
In fact, we checked. You could've.

38:25.785 --> 38:28.945
The shooting, itself, would
only take a few seconds...

38:30.025 --> 38:31.825
..for an experienced sniper.

38:34.185 --> 38:35.705
Ex-soldier turned rogue.

38:40.305 --> 38:42.705
SCREAMING

38:42.705 --> 38:45.705
Well, that's a nice little
story you've got there.

38:45.705 --> 38:48.145
Shame you don't have
a scrap of evidence.

38:51.905 --> 38:54.785
OK. Come on, let's go.

38:57.145 --> 38:58.425
Nice talking to you.

39:04.065 --> 39:05.905
Davey!

39:08.585 --> 39:10.745
So he's lying there,

39:10.745 --> 39:12.425
covered in blood, blind drunk.

39:12.425 --> 39:14.905
You'll never guess
what he was singing.

39:14.905 --> 39:18.465
♪ I did it my way. ♪

39:19.705 --> 39:23.025
Remember that "old bird
with the ice cream cone"?

39:23.025 --> 39:24.505
Is that the best you can do?

39:24.505 --> 39:26.665
No. He is.

39:34.025 --> 39:35.545
I'll ask you again.

39:35.545 --> 39:38.665
Who ordered the hit
on Peter Bradshaw?

39:38.665 --> 39:41.785
We can place you at the exact
spot the shot was fired from.

39:41.785 --> 39:43.185
You have the expertise

39:43.185 --> 39:45.465
and your alibi's fallen through.

39:45.465 --> 39:48.705
You're going away
for a long time, mate.

39:48.705 --> 39:53.665
Now, you could make it shorter
if you tell us who paid you.

39:53.665 --> 39:55.985
Davey, we're just here to
give her the information.

39:55.985 --> 39:58.145
Not accuse her. I won't
accuse her of anything.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.185
The Ways and Means Act, remember?

40:00.185 --> 40:03.305
I'll tell her Digger talked, see
what she's got to say about that.

40:03.305 --> 40:05.305
You've got some nerve coming here!

40:06.465 --> 40:08.545
I have nothing to
say to you. Nothing.

40:08.545 --> 40:10.225
Oh, you might want to
think about that.

40:10.225 --> 40:12.225
Leave me alone. Go on, get out.

40:12.225 --> 40:14.665
I said, go. Now!

40:14.665 --> 40:16.745
You got a hearing problem?

40:16.745 --> 40:19.425
I would go but I
can't leave things like this.

40:22.105 --> 40:23.665
It was a mistake coming here.

40:23.665 --> 40:25.985
I just wanted to pay my respects.

40:25.985 --> 40:28.705
I'm the last person you
want to see right now.

40:28.705 --> 40:30.225
I should've realised.

40:30.225 --> 40:32.385
I'm so sorry. I'll go.
Stay where you are.

40:32.385 --> 40:34.465
Arrest him. For what?

40:34.465 --> 40:37.425
Poor thing, she's all mixed up.
Oh, shut up. Just shut up.

40:37.425 --> 40:38.585
It's over, all right?

40:38.585 --> 40:40.545
You want the truth,
I'll give you the truth.

40:40.545 --> 40:42.465
She's all mixed up.
This is too much stress.

40:42.465 --> 40:43.905
He's come here threatening me.

40:43.905 --> 40:46.385
He says he'll do a kiss and tell
about himself and Peter.

40:46.385 --> 40:47.745
That's not what I said at all.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.945
She's upset. She's looking
for someone to blame.

40:49.945 --> 40:52.305
You're not getting
another penny out of me.

40:52.305 --> 40:53.545
"Another" penny?

40:53.545 --> 40:54.985
It's not important.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.225
We'll be the judge of that.
Look, she approached me.

40:57.225 --> 40:58.585
It was her idea.

40:58.585 --> 40:59.825
To do what?

41:02.865 --> 41:05.625
Come on, we can do this
here or down the station.

41:05.625 --> 41:06.985
She paid me, all right?

41:06.985 --> 41:08.545
To do what?

41:09.665 --> 41:10.705
To leave Peter.

41:11.825 --> 41:13.665
Oh, come on, that's pathetic.

41:13.665 --> 41:15.105
Is this true?

41:15.105 --> 41:16.705
I did it for my husband.

41:16.705 --> 41:18.025
To get him out of his clutches.

41:18.025 --> 41:19.985
So you could get your
claws back in, you mean.

41:19.985 --> 41:22.825
You were only ever interested in
his money. Your money, you mean?

41:22.825 --> 41:24.185
That's how she controlled him.

41:24.185 --> 41:26.465
Said she'd leave him without a penny
if they split up

41:26.465 --> 41:28.705
and he still chose me. He loved me.

41:28.705 --> 41:30.385
What would you know about love?

41:30.385 --> 41:31.945
You cheap little rent boy!

41:31.945 --> 41:35.025
If I am, Peter couldn't
get enough of me.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.425
He wept when he knew I was leaving.

41:37.425 --> 41:38.945
You should've heard him beg.

41:38.945 --> 41:40.185
Liar!

41:40.185 --> 41:41.625
You're a dried up old hag.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.065
You made his skin crawl.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.905
He's better off dead than stuck
with you for the rest of his life.

41:45.905 --> 41:47.385
Enough!

41:47.385 --> 41:48.785
That's it. That's...

41:50.305 --> 41:51.865
It was you.

41:51.865 --> 41:54.305
You two... You drove him to it.

41:57.705 --> 42:02.185
You broke his heart and you
sucked the life out of him.

42:02.185 --> 42:04.705
Peter Bradshaw ordered
the murder on himself.

42:06.265 --> 42:07.985
That's ridiculous.

42:07.985 --> 42:09.545
Well, we'll know soon enough.

42:09.545 --> 42:12.385
We have the gunman down the station,
which is where we're going now.

42:12.385 --> 42:14.385
I'm arresting you for
suspicion of blackmail.

42:14.385 --> 42:16.905
You don't have to say anything but
it may harm your defence

42:16.905 --> 42:18.625
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

42:18.625 --> 42:22.025
something you later
rely on in court.

42:26.345 --> 42:29.225
Those pink diamonds
you were looking for,

42:29.225 --> 42:32.265
I think we'll find your husband
used them to pay his killer.

42:33.505 --> 42:35.105
You've had a shock.

42:35.105 --> 42:37.225
I'll get the maid
to make you some tea.

42:47.745 --> 42:50.105
So, he took a contract
out on himself?

42:50.105 --> 42:51.665
I know it's surprising.

42:53.465 --> 42:56.105
Not really, when you think about it.

42:57.305 --> 42:58.985
Told you, didn't I?

42:58.985 --> 43:00.385
Sorry?

43:00.385 --> 43:02.865
That wife of his made
his life a misery.

43:02.865 --> 43:04.985
I pointed you in
the right direction.
