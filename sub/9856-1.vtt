WEBVTT

00:03.332 --> 00:04.274
That was Eva.

00:04.344 --> 00:06.551
Her and Sebastian found
a wreck from two days ago,

00:06.575 --> 00:08.503
- a burned up car.
- Yeah?

00:08.623 --> 00:10.063
She's sure it's Anne-Marie's.

00:10.485 --> 00:12.808
Arabela! Arabela...

00:13.406 --> 00:14.606
It was my boss.

00:15.496 --> 00:18.089
He attacked me. He helped him.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.343
Genovese's escaped.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.783
- I'm going back to Paris.
- Excuse me?

00:21.943 --> 00:23.158
On the next train back.

00:23.183 --> 00:24.317
Louis is in trouble.

00:24.346 --> 00:25.851
There is every possibility

00:25.863 --> 00:28.320
that he will be dead by tomorrow afternoon.

00:29.901 --> 00:32.183
If you ever want to see
the Daniels alive again,

00:32.213 --> 00:35.322
I want my brother-in-law brought here.

00:35.632 --> 00:37.833
- I cannot.
- You have 24 hours.

00:47.684 --> 00:48.684
Will she survive?

00:49.884 --> 00:50.884
I don't know.

00:59.404 --> 01:01.337
- No change.
- Will she wake up?

01:01.457 --> 01:03.199
Well, they say they're not sure,

01:03.524 --> 01:05.203
- but I don't think so.
- Is it Anne-Marie?

01:05.404 --> 01:06.124
No.

01:06.161 --> 01:08.404
This woman walked away from the
accident, we followed her tracks.

01:08.414 --> 01:11.404
Maybe she's one of the women
Anne-Marie saved. She left with two.

01:11.884 --> 01:12.964
There were some locals at the scene

01:12.974 --> 01:14.524
now searching the area for anyone else.

01:14.537 --> 01:16.451
She has to be out there. She
couldn't have just disappeared.

01:16.475 --> 01:17.604
There's a body.

01:18.484 --> 01:19.204
A body?

01:19.231 --> 01:21.084
Unidentified female from a crash.

01:21.964 --> 01:23.284
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

01:23.558 --> 01:25.724
- Why is she not identified?
- She's badly burned.

01:25.844 --> 01:26.964
She's in the morgue.

01:28.444 --> 01:29.950
- I need to see her.
- No, Eva,

01:29.985 --> 01:31.665
wait. It's not a good idea.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.844
- Hickman?
- Genovese called.

01:38.764 --> 01:39.764
He escaped?

01:39.804 --> 01:41.964
Seeger's boss was working
for him. Hit her from behind.

01:42.326 --> 01:43.364
Son of a bitch!

01:45.764 --> 01:47.604
Where are Eva and Sebastian right now?

01:47.612 --> 01:49.092
They're here with us at the hospital.

01:49.524 --> 01:51.703
I'll be at the heliport
with the chopper in 15.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.684
You're going after Genovese?

01:53.804 --> 01:54.844
No, that's going to have to wait.

01:54.858 --> 01:56.604
We've got to go to Paris.
Louis is in trouble.

01:56.615 --> 01:58.084
What? What... what's going on?

01:58.142 --> 02:00.222
I'll tell you about it when
I see you. Just be ready.

02:16.164 --> 02:17.164
Hey!

02:17.951 --> 02:19.284
Let me out of here!

02:19.444 --> 02:21.491
Back away from the door!

02:22.084 --> 02:23.084
Let me go.

02:23.524 --> 02:26.154
- Let me go, my husband...
- Your husband is here with me.

02:26.156 --> 02:27.518
If you don't back away,

02:27.524 --> 02:29.484
I will gut him right here.

02:30.070 --> 02:32.764
- Back off!
- Okay! Okay.

02:33.646 --> 02:35.724
Okay, I'm back.

02:51.350 --> 02:54.004
Louis? Louis...

02:55.804 --> 02:57.368
Oh, my love.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.364
Look at me. Louis...

03:07.884 --> 03:08.884
Eva?

03:14.604 --> 03:15.804
I can't open it.

03:19.244 --> 03:21.284
- Is it her, Tommy?
- I don't know.

03:21.746 --> 03:24.484
They have to check her DNA.
Anne-Marie's mother is on her way.

03:24.892 --> 03:27.233
- There has to be proof.
- I agree,

03:27.809 --> 03:29.684
but we need to go.

03:29.904 --> 03:31.484
The Major's in trouble.

04:08.455 --> 04:12.844
You said Seeger's boss hit her?

04:12.872 --> 04:14.684
Aye, she has a lump on her head,

04:14.804 --> 04:17.164
but she feels more responsible than hurt.

04:17.738 --> 04:20.764
We left her with the injured woman
we found at Anne-Marie's accident.

04:20.884 --> 04:21.884
Good.

04:22.101 --> 04:23.884
There's nothing good about the accident.

04:24.004 --> 04:25.814
She has something to do.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.204
Time to think is not always helpful.

04:31.884 --> 04:34.232
We have until 1:00 p.m. tomorrow.

04:34.753 --> 04:37.284
Or help a war criminal escape prison?

04:37.404 --> 04:39.124
Which is not going to happen.

04:39.152 --> 04:40.832
If we don't find the Major and his wife...

04:40.856 --> 04:43.176
Dimitrov will execute the two of them.

04:43.296 --> 04:45.536
What does Louis have to
do with this war criminal?

04:45.656 --> 04:47.311
This... this... this Bardov?

04:47.329 --> 04:49.936
Bardov is Dimitrov's brother-in-law,

04:50.056 --> 04:53.896
and Dimitrov is responsible for
the death of Louis' son Ãtienne.

04:54.016 --> 04:55.862
Dimitrov killed Major Daniel's son?

04:55.982 --> 05:00.481
- Well, he's responsible for it, yes.
- Right, we have less than 19 hours,

05:00.499 --> 05:01.917
but unless I'm missing something,

05:01.936 --> 05:03.616
we have absolutely no idea where to start.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.376
No, we have a relationship with someone

05:05.976 --> 05:08.960
who may be able to point
us in the right direction.

05:08.969 --> 05:10.576
- We do?
- Well, you know him.

05:10.696 --> 05:12.976
- Lev Marianski.
- The Russian businessman.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.616
We... we rescued his son
in the south of France.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.006
- Right, the kidnapping.
- Why would he help us?

05:18.024 --> 05:19.625
Well, he's on his way here right now

05:19.643 --> 05:21.692
with what he thinks he
might give you an idea

05:22.216 --> 05:24.776
as to where Dimitrov would
hold high-value hostages.

05:24.936 --> 05:26.824
Helping us

05:27.638 --> 05:30.061
could be really dangerous
for Mr. Marianski.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.019
Well, he... he made it clear to me that

05:32.656 --> 05:35.576
he was aware of all the risks.

05:36.576 --> 05:39.107
This field office is at your disposal.

05:39.656 --> 05:42.162
If there's anything they can't provide,

05:42.372 --> 05:45.637
just call me, and it will be yours.

05:45.757 --> 05:48.674
- You're not staying?
- No, I have to go to the ICC.

05:49.656 --> 05:54.125
Dimitrov knew that I had
taken Bardov out of custody

05:54.171 --> 05:56.641
11 times since he's been incarcerated.

05:57.416 --> 06:00.811
And only seven of those were official.

06:00.856 --> 06:02.936
He has a source inside the ICC prison.

06:03.136 --> 06:06.056
Yes, so it is essential at least it appear

06:06.176 --> 06:08.816
that I am making all the
arrangements for his transfer.

06:11.376 --> 06:12.691
Good luck.

06:23.776 --> 06:24.776
Dorn?

06:25.894 --> 06:27.412
Does Louis know

06:27.616 --> 06:30.631
Rebecca is the reason that
their son was murdered?

06:31.136 --> 06:34.536
Bardov is a war criminal. If
this is about his imprisonment,

06:35.136 --> 06:38.277
and Louis had nothing to do
with that, then it's Rebecca.

06:38.696 --> 06:43.034
It's Rebecca who prosecuted him with you.

06:44.136 --> 06:45.311
Right?

06:45.976 --> 06:46.816
No.

06:46.976 --> 06:47.736
No?

06:47.976 --> 06:51.083
No, Louis doesn't know.

06:52.296 --> 06:54.357
And I would appreciate

06:54.576 --> 06:59.150
it if you could keep it just between
the two of us until I can find

06:59.456 --> 07:01.619
a suitable time to tell him.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.619
Thank you, Hickman.

07:20.176 --> 07:21.846
Stay away from us.

07:28.776 --> 07:31.736
I will enjoy so much playing with you.

07:53.136 --> 07:55.802
- Detective Hickman.
- Mr. Marianski.

07:55.816 --> 07:57.293
It's very good of you to come.

07:57.736 --> 08:00.256
- You gave me back my son.
- Yeah.

08:00.416 --> 08:01.591
I am in your debt,

08:01.816 --> 08:04.070
and I am a man who repays his debts.

08:05.216 --> 08:07.816
I've brought some files
that might be helpful.

08:07.936 --> 08:09.942
All of the records I kept.

08:11.536 --> 08:14.571
I acted mainly as
Dimitrov's business agent,

08:14.896 --> 08:17.896
procuring buildings and
maintaining his records.

08:18.096 --> 08:20.515
What, like his accountant?

08:20.816 --> 08:22.052
Close.

08:24.016 --> 08:25.496
- Yes?
- Mr. Dimitrov.

08:25.656 --> 08:27.776
Marianski has arrived
at the ICC Field Office.

08:27.896 --> 08:30.091
- He's with them now?
- Yes, he is.

08:31.536 --> 08:34.043
I knew he was among those betraying me.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.457
The usual arrangements have been made.

08:37.096 --> 08:38.096
Good.

08:38.856 --> 08:39.976
Very good.

08:40.496 --> 08:43.135
This looks like every building
Dimitrov owns in Europe.

08:43.296 --> 08:44.690
There are quite a few,

08:45.536 --> 08:49.176
but not all of them are empty
or good places to hold hostages.

08:49.336 --> 08:50.415
This is great.

08:50.461 --> 08:52.582
We should be able to
narrow it down quite a bit.

08:52.591 --> 08:55.456
I was treated badly by him the
entire time I was his employee.

08:57.056 --> 08:59.936
All of us were. We were
like... like dogs to him.

09:00.056 --> 09:02.296
So you're turning on him
because he was a shite boss?

09:02.416 --> 09:05.216
Suppose I said there was a sum of money

09:05.336 --> 09:07.656
that I'd like to turn over to my boy?

09:07.776 --> 09:09.895
Enough for him to start his life

09:09.936 --> 09:11.576
with all the opportunity he could need...

09:12.976 --> 09:14.889
but I can't do it

09:15.696 --> 09:17.856
until Dimitrov is out of the picture.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.462
So you're trying to get rid of him?

09:19.496 --> 09:21.296
Use the files to put him away.

09:23.256 --> 09:24.492
Forever.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.296
How do you feel?

09:34.856 --> 09:36.176
I'm dizzy.

09:37.136 --> 09:40.010
- Careful.
- I'm fine. It's okay.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.696
But what about you?

09:44.696 --> 09:46.366
There was blood.

09:46.576 --> 09:48.205
I stabbed one of them...

09:49.096 --> 09:50.501
with scissors.

09:51.296 --> 09:54.845
I could have told them
about fighting with you.

09:57.816 --> 09:59.296
I'm so sorry.

10:03.113 --> 10:05.629
I should have never gone back
to the apartment that night.

10:06.416 --> 10:08.896
- That was stupid and childish.
- No apologies.

10:09.616 --> 10:11.696
Do you know where we are?

10:14.216 --> 10:15.717
I don't understand.

10:16.056 --> 10:17.736
Why take us hostage?

10:18.136 --> 10:20.216
They probably only used me to get you.

10:20.336 --> 10:23.802
Yes, but why not just kill us?

10:25.616 --> 10:27.136
Maybe they're planning on it.

10:27.256 --> 10:28.640
Not for a while.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.781
What do you mean?

10:31.016 --> 10:32.665
They brought us food, Rebecca.

10:34.016 --> 10:35.581
They want us alive.

10:36.688 --> 10:39.304
You have definitely repaid us anything

10:40.296 --> 10:41.936
that you think you might owe us.

10:42.936 --> 10:44.061
Thank you.

10:44.416 --> 10:45.744
My pleasure.

10:49.668 --> 10:51.176
Well, maybe I'll see you soon.

10:51.296 --> 10:52.312
Maybe.

10:53.896 --> 10:55.668
You don't think so?

10:56.976 --> 10:59.501
Very little escapes Dimitrov's attention.

10:59.536 --> 11:00.616
Very little.

11:01.296 --> 11:03.689
He's been watching me since we fell out.

11:04.896 --> 11:06.534
The good news is,

11:07.176 --> 11:08.776
whatever happens to me,

11:10.736 --> 11:14.373
if you can put Dimitrov away for good,

11:14.696 --> 11:17.025
my son will be more than fine.

11:19.536 --> 11:20.967
Just...

11:21.736 --> 11:26.061
don't doubt for a second that he
will kill your boss or any of you.

11:26.256 --> 11:28.238
Show him no mercy.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.048
Be careful.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.901
He all but knew he was going
to get killed for helping us.

12:43.977 --> 12:45.830
I'd feel a lot better if
we all went back inside.

12:45.839 --> 12:48.377
Actually, I don't even think
they noticed I was here, Tommy.

12:48.613 --> 12:50.241
Still, man, better safe, right?

12:50.459 --> 12:52.227
Yeah. Wait.

12:53.563 --> 12:54.899
Wait, wait...

12:55.685 --> 12:57.413
He said Dimitrov...

12:59.024 --> 13:00.753
He said Dimitrov was watching him.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.458
It sure looks like it.

13:03.503 --> 13:06.528
But wh... why let him
come into a building and...

13:07.786 --> 13:09.896
and talk to us? I mean,

13:10.121 --> 13:11.909
clearly he knew he was here.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.779
Maybe he didn't know it was
us he was coming to talk to.

13:14.936 --> 13:17.181
He left his château with a bunch of files

13:17.226 --> 13:20.658
and went to an ICC Field
Office on the same day

13:20.947 --> 13:25.122
that Dimitrov kidnaps a French major?

13:25.701 --> 13:29.119
It's like he wasn't worried about
what he was going to tell us.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.322
There's probably nothing in
those files that we can use.

13:34.776 --> 13:36.577
Then we're back to zero.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.316
Anything we can use as a weapon.

13:41.062 --> 13:43.577
A loose brick, a piece of glass.

13:43.695 --> 13:45.766
I don't even want to know
what's on these walls.

13:45.803 --> 13:48.331
We need something to make
them take me out of this room.

13:48.684 --> 13:49.431
What?

13:49.706 --> 13:52.063
- You'd leave me here alone?
- Just as long as necessary,

13:52.181 --> 13:55.146
- don't worry. You should eat.
- No thanks.

13:55.183 --> 13:56.424
Come on, just the bread.

14:01.649 --> 14:04.723
Ugh. You sure they're not
trying to kill us this way?

14:06.010 --> 14:07.010
Louis?

14:07.425 --> 14:08.945
This could be...

14:15.557 --> 14:16.775
Use this.

14:22.281 --> 14:23.431
Wait.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.290
Let me out of here!

14:34.864 --> 14:37.067
Hey! Let me out of here!

14:44.153 --> 14:47.373
Keep your wits about you. This is
not a place to let your defenses down.

14:47.493 --> 14:48.653
Stay alert.

14:48.946 --> 14:51.205
They are bringing Bardov down now, sir.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.358
Thank you.

14:52.728 --> 14:54.800
Did you put all these men in here, sir?

14:54.845 --> 14:56.008
Not all.

14:56.128 --> 14:58.368
- They are war criminals?
- No.

14:58.488 --> 15:00.635
Some of them are just accused.

15:00.848 --> 15:02.986
They haven't stood trial yet.

15:03.808 --> 15:05.538
If they are convicted,

15:05.803 --> 15:08.621
the proper prison will
be negotiated for them.

15:08.648 --> 15:11.566
You know, I never really believed
in evil before, but it's...

15:11.928 --> 15:14.408
Are you familiar with the
writings of Joseph Conrad?

15:15.128 --> 15:16.579
No, sir.

15:17.433 --> 15:23.155
"Belief in a supernatural
source of evil is not necessary:

15:23.593 --> 15:26.833
men alone are quite capable
of every wickedness."

15:27.713 --> 15:29.237
He wrote that.

15:29.713 --> 15:30.713
Excuse me.

15:35.425 --> 15:37.833
- Was Marianski helpful?
- He's dead.

15:38.753 --> 15:39.953
Oh, God.

15:40.353 --> 15:42.266
Gunned down right outside our building.

15:42.513 --> 15:44.168
He knew they'd know.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.171
Well, he said he was being followed.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.193
You spoke to him?

15:49.033 --> 15:51.113
Oh, yeah, the hitters got
him when he was leaving,

15:51.593 --> 15:53.443
after he talked to us.

15:53.563 --> 15:54.568
Oh, my God.

15:54.595 --> 15:57.477
Yeah, Dimitrov let him talk to us.

15:57.495 --> 15:59.818
They could have killed him
when he was in the building.

16:00.632 --> 16:04.392
But Dimitrov wasn't worried about
what Marianski would tell you

16:04.593 --> 16:07.785
because he's holding them
somewhere Marianski wouldn't know.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.502
Maybe it's a building that
Dimitrov bought after they fell out.

16:10.513 --> 16:12.368
Within the past two years.

16:13.353 --> 16:15.341
That's exactly what I needed to know.

16:15.353 --> 16:16.673
Thank you, sir.

16:16.793 --> 16:20.792
Okay, we're looking for a
real estate transaction made

16:20.833 --> 16:22.347
in the last two years,

16:22.353 --> 16:25.749
something that Marianski
wouldn't know anything about.

16:25.793 --> 16:27.835
Most of what he's done
in the last two years

16:27.853 --> 16:31.219
is divest himself of everything.
It's like he's cashing out.

16:31.339 --> 16:32.810
The only thing that he's bought at all

16:32.828 --> 16:36.076
in this time frame is a London
minor league football club.

16:36.113 --> 16:38.792
- A football club?
- You call it soccer.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.914
I know what a football club is.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.411
When he bought the club,
did it come with a stadium?

16:45.553 --> 16:47.929
Black Tiger Stadium in Edgeware.

16:47.948 --> 16:50.028
Well, we're not going to
be able to get around London

16:50.371 --> 16:51.990
without the help of someone,

16:52.193 --> 16:54.669
someone at the Met, someone important.

17:02.633 --> 17:05.070
♪ Let's get it on ♪

17:05.353 --> 17:08.098
♪ Let's love, baby ♪

17:13.313 --> 17:15.752

- Dorn, sir!

17:25.576 --> 17:28.547
- What? What did you say?
- I'm sorry, Chief Inspector,

17:28.548 --> 17:32.352
but you told me if I ever got a call
from a man named Dorn at the ICC,

17:32.353 --> 17:34.247
I was to contact you immediately.

17:35.153 --> 17:37.192
Oh, piss off!

17:39.473 --> 17:41.280
Was that you singing?

17:41.500 --> 17:43.401
Dorn, you old sod!

17:43.402 --> 17:45.396
You caught me at my
weekly Karaoke indulgence.

17:45.414 --> 17:47.540
Was the Chief Inspector going over well?

17:47.562 --> 17:48.703
The crowd loves me!

17:48.753 --> 17:50.583
Hey, you were just cheering
three blokes singing

17:50.605 --> 17:52.018
the bloody Spice Girls!

17:52.138 --> 17:56.593
Anyhow, listen, you're not one for
a casual catch-up. What can I do?

17:56.713 --> 17:58.559
I need you to help me with something.

18:23.637 --> 18:26.929
Carl Hickman. Vittoria, Berger, McConnell.

18:26.957 --> 18:29.161
- Chief Inspector Miles Lennon.
- Yeah.

18:29.281 --> 18:31.018
Welcome to London.

18:40.229 --> 18:42.345
- Sit in the chair there.
- Yes, sir.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.756
Who is he?

18:55.916 --> 18:56.916
Thank you.

18:57.276 --> 18:59.076
- That's all?
- Yes.

18:59.756 --> 19:01.396
- I failed?
- No,

19:01.516 --> 19:03.116
not at all. In fact, you're perfect.

19:03.139 --> 19:04.465
Wait outside.

19:05.196 --> 19:08.076
- And remember my admonitions.
- Yes, sir.

19:10.156 --> 19:12.679
I wanted to see the two
of you in the same room,

19:13.276 --> 19:16.196
to confirm that you were
the same size and height.

19:17.196 --> 19:19.716
Why would you need a decoy of me?

19:20.156 --> 19:21.676
Your brother-in-law has taken prisoner

19:21.796 --> 19:23.929
people who are very dear to me.

19:25.316 --> 19:27.076
How is that my concern?

19:27.236 --> 19:30.276
Because he said he would let
them go if I helped you to escape.

19:32.556 --> 19:33.556
What?

19:33.636 --> 19:35.106
More than that.

19:35.116 --> 19:37.716
He knows every time we
have left here together.

19:37.996 --> 19:40.756
Precisely every time.

19:44.196 --> 19:46.750
Son of a bitch wants to kill me.

19:47.236 --> 19:48.236
Exactly.

19:54.516 --> 19:55.876
How can I help you?

19:58.456 --> 20:00.373
Welcome to New Scotland Yard.

20:01.336 --> 20:05.616
Right, these lads and
lady are from the ICC,

20:05.642 --> 20:08.157
and need our help in rescuing
their leader and his wife

20:08.277 --> 20:09.721
from a Russian gangster.

20:10.016 --> 20:11.336
Sounds like a bloody penny dreadful.

20:11.349 --> 20:13.708
Someone remind me to
write an opera about this.

20:14.336 --> 20:16.145
You're not actually writing
that down to remind me, are you?

20:16.169 --> 20:17.998
Some of them are a tad gullible,

20:18.016 --> 20:20.576
but the men and women in this room
are the best we have at their jobs.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.604
Tactical, comms, counter-intelligence.

20:24.456 --> 20:25.461
Bring them up to date.

20:25.498 --> 20:28.816
We rewound CCTV images around the stadium,

20:29.016 --> 20:31.496
and there has been movement
in the last 24 hours,

20:31.616 --> 20:33.056
but not in the last 12.

20:33.061 --> 20:34.456
Did you see the Major or his wife?

20:34.576 --> 20:35.936
A couple of vehicles parked close,

20:36.056 --> 20:38.616
men surrounded one figure and
they rushed him through quickly,

20:39.136 --> 20:40.616
but we couldn't get a very good look.

20:40.976 --> 20:42.216
How many?

20:42.336 --> 20:44.496
At least 10 unique
figures moving in and out,

20:44.616 --> 20:47.096
but there's no way to know how
many are posted on the inside.

20:47.216 --> 20:48.816
Are these the schematics of the stadium?

20:48.936 --> 20:51.134
Yeah, but they're more than 10 years old,

20:51.376 --> 20:52.552
and the building's been closed

20:52.576 --> 20:54.776
for almost that long and
has fallen into disrepair.

20:55.336 --> 20:57.136
No one knows what it looks like below.

20:57.179 --> 20:59.776
Disrepair? Looks like a pile of shite.

20:59.896 --> 21:01.096
You're McConnell?

21:01.579 --> 21:03.912
- Yeah, Police Services...
- Northern Ireland.

21:03.936 --> 21:05.421
I know your family very well.

21:05.736 --> 21:06.736
How?

21:06.774 --> 21:09.427
I reckon you know the
answer to that, Tinker.

21:13.176 --> 21:14.476
Only one question remaining.

21:14.484 --> 21:15.484
Which is?

21:15.536 --> 21:17.616
Well, since none of them
was seen on any cameras,

21:18.600 --> 21:20.296
are you sure your boss is even inside?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.976
No, I can't really say for sure.

21:21.985 --> 21:23.204
It's the only place that makes sense.

21:23.228 --> 21:25.456
I'm sorry, I can't authorize a major raid

21:25.470 --> 21:27.496
based on "It's the only
place that makes sense".

21:27.500 --> 21:28.958
Is this because you've
got a problem with me?

21:28.982 --> 21:30.765
- I never said that.
- We don't have a lot of time.

21:30.766 --> 21:32.192
I'm aware of that.

21:32.531 --> 21:35.416
But I need concrete knowledge before
I put any of my people at risk.

21:35.656 --> 21:37.616
I may have a way to
get some cameras inside.

21:37.634 --> 21:39.628
- You brought them?
- A few.

21:40.176 --> 21:41.176
You can do that?

21:42.296 --> 21:45.136
We need to use the buildings around
the stadium and the sniper rifle.

21:46.216 --> 21:47.816
Let me out of here!

21:53.576 --> 21:55.204
You can scream forever.

21:56.016 --> 21:57.317
No one can hear you.

21:57.811 --> 21:59.096
Piss off.

21:59.101 --> 22:00.656
Oh, you have spirit.

22:01.085 --> 22:04.056
Does your cop husband
appreciate your spirit?

22:05.736 --> 22:06.976
I don't think so.

22:09.216 --> 22:11.696
I don't think he appreciates you at all.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.976
- Screw you!
- Screw me?

22:15.556 --> 22:18.936
Why do women like you always
think that they are so much better

22:18.949 --> 22:20.176
than a man like me?

22:20.221 --> 22:22.856
Oh, you'll love this.

22:22.976 --> 22:26.176
You'll love this, but you better not bite.

22:26.624 --> 22:27.712
Hey!

22:36.536 --> 22:38.307
You're going to die for this.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.736
You're next.

22:50.376 --> 22:53.540
This Sebastian of yours,
his cameras going to work?

22:54.256 --> 22:56.476
Never seen a gadget of his fail.

22:56.816 --> 22:57.896
Ought to be fun.

22:57.930 --> 22:59.656
Not for nothing, but, uh...

23:00.976 --> 23:02.028
McConnell...

23:04.176 --> 23:05.176
he's good.

23:05.495 --> 23:06.896
How long have you known him?

23:07.496 --> 23:08.496
Six months.

23:10.376 --> 23:12.216
And you think I don't know the real him.

23:13.936 --> 23:15.136
That's funny.

23:15.638 --> 23:17.056
He's good inside.

23:17.065 --> 23:18.547
Good where it counts.

23:24.008 --> 23:25.654
Bothering you?

23:26.536 --> 23:29.056
No, no more than usual.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.514
Are you high right now?

23:33.776 --> 23:34.896
That's subtle.

23:35.736 --> 23:38.459
I'm going up against
armed suspects with you.

23:40.456 --> 23:41.816
I want to know the situation.

23:41.936 --> 23:45.536
I take pain meds, but they aren't
as strong as they used to be.

23:45.576 --> 23:47.576
Codeine pills instead of
morphine patches, I know.

23:47.736 --> 23:49.336
I researched you all before you arrived.

23:49.456 --> 23:52.456
What web site has my prescription history?

23:55.296 --> 23:58.136
Also, Dorn did give me a bit of a heads-up.

23:58.936 --> 24:03.056
Well, like you with Tommy, we
don't always see eye to eye.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.496
Actually, he did tell me that
you were someone whose judgement

24:06.511 --> 24:07.700
I should trust.

24:08.336 --> 24:09.696
That's good enough for you?

24:11.696 --> 24:15.519
I know you know how it feels to devote
your life to something, to an institution,

24:15.639 --> 24:18.017
and then just have it
betray you completely.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.602
But do you know how it
feels to have someone

24:22.224 --> 24:23.669
believe in you?

24:24.096 --> 24:25.882
I mean, not just believe,

24:26.102 --> 24:27.812
but to step up,

24:28.496 --> 24:29.776
give you back the things

24:29.806 --> 24:31.686
that you thought you were
going to lose forever?

24:32.230 --> 24:34.816
Hope in the face of despair?

24:37.453 --> 24:38.998
When this is over,

24:40.216 --> 24:42.776
maybe I'll tell you what Dorn
did for me in the Falklands.

24:46.656 --> 24:47.797
But for now...

24:50.001 --> 24:53.349
yeah, his word is good enough for me.

24:57.016 --> 25:01.256
I've known the McConnell family
for almost all my professional life.

25:02.696 --> 25:06.056
Trust me when I tell you that
none of them are, as you say it,

25:07.096 --> 25:09.256
"Good inside where it counts."

25:52.056 --> 25:54.456
Who does that gobshite tosser
think he is, judging me?

25:54.576 --> 25:58.056
Look, I'm not trying to defend him
or anything, but he's got a point.

25:58.176 --> 26:00.061
I mean, he's probably had some professional

26:00.096 --> 26:01.231
run-ins with your family,

26:01.256 --> 26:03.616
- not pleasant ones, I imagine...
- This is you not defending him?

26:03.637 --> 26:05.900
You know how many times people
question me about my father?

26:05.924 --> 26:08.816
- So what? It doesn't make it right.
- No, but it makes it inevitable.

26:08.823 --> 26:12.061
Right, let's mount up! And if nobody minds,

26:12.096 --> 26:14.672
I'd rather have not Belfast boy
here stand behind me with a rifle.

26:14.696 --> 26:16.656
Don't need to be behind
you to end you, big man.

26:16.688 --> 26:19.341
It was a joke! Joke. I was
trying to ease the tension.

26:19.461 --> 26:21.416
Come on then, let's go find your boss.

26:29.016 --> 26:30.176
Hang him up.

26:30.181 --> 26:31.336
Take that off!

26:33.472 --> 26:36.449
Come on... come on!

26:47.768 --> 26:50.768
The cameras are inside these
low-velocity rifle rounds.

26:50.786 --> 26:52.067
You are kidding.

26:52.085 --> 26:53.677
We've tried them. They work.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.100
Yeah, there's only one real
problem with the low-velocity.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.664
- Wind.
- Wind.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.000
2 Para, Falklands.

27:02.978 --> 27:04.753
Where did you learn to shoot?

27:05.073 --> 27:08.932
My da taught me, to
protect us from you paras.

27:11.512 --> 27:14.172
Okay, Tommy, pick a
window, the wind is calming.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.445
- Nice shot.
- Let's hope we get an image.

27:31.002 --> 27:32.493
Look.

27:34.716 --> 27:36.161
Officer Seeger.

27:37.801 --> 27:39.389
Officer Seeger?

27:41.401 --> 27:43.241
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Do you know who I am?

27:43.281 --> 27:45.303
Of course. Regional Commander...

27:45.705 --> 27:47.571
- Jonkers.
- Mm-hmm.

27:47.691 --> 27:50.841
I came to tell you we located
your boss, Commander Bergen.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.361
Have you arrested him?

27:52.521 --> 27:54.121
Apparently shot himself.

27:55.521 --> 27:56.521
He's dead?

27:56.641 --> 27:58.921
The shame of today was
too much for him to handle.

28:01.481 --> 28:03.721
Being taken hostage in the escape.

28:03.841 --> 28:06.001
At least that's how the report will read.

28:06.513 --> 28:08.561
He helped a prisoner escape.

28:08.681 --> 28:10.721
What difference does it
make now, Seeger? He's dead.

28:10.894 --> 28:12.561
But that isn't the truth.

28:12.568 --> 28:15.361
We're the police, Seeger. The
truth is what we say it is.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.801
Our small department
can't afford a scandal.

28:17.818 --> 28:19.437
I'm sure you understand that.

28:21.339 --> 28:22.761
Inspector?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.561
Thank you. You made a wise choice.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.590
Sir?

28:30.559 --> 28:32.001
Where is he now?

28:32.041 --> 28:33.161
He's at the morgue,

28:33.281 --> 28:35.961
but don't concern yourself
with that. Go home and rest.

28:36.481 --> 28:37.801
You've earned it.

28:48.921 --> 28:51.561
Prisoner Bardov is being
released in my custody.

28:51.681 --> 28:54.761
Michel Lechnya Dorn, ICC Prosecutor.

28:54.881 --> 28:56.435
Document's in order.

29:07.681 --> 29:08.951
He's leaving.

29:21.707 --> 29:23.041
Strap him in.

29:47.041 --> 29:48.801
- Yes.
- I have Bardov.

29:49.119 --> 29:51.201
I'll text you an address in Belgium.

29:51.973 --> 29:54.041
It should take several hours to get here.

29:54.201 --> 29:57.425
When you arrive, pull in,
and you'll see my vehicle.

30:02.681 --> 30:05.330
They will be there in three hours.

30:06.025 --> 30:08.361
I want everyone who comes dead.

30:09.801 --> 30:10.921
Everyone.

30:12.574 --> 30:14.041
That's the last one, Tommy.

30:14.161 --> 30:16.521
Thanks. I needed more pressure.

30:16.544 --> 30:18.456
Yeah, well, we still have
no trace of the Major,

30:18.481 --> 30:19.974
and only a couple of hours left.

30:27.290 --> 30:28.881
Wind is calming.

30:37.816 --> 30:39.321
What the hell is that?

30:39.441 --> 30:41.001
I don't know.

30:49.052 --> 30:50.561
No, that's definitely him.

30:50.681 --> 30:52.521
- He is alive.
- Barely.

30:53.250 --> 30:54.681
I need some time.

30:55.001 --> 30:56.561
Well, we don't have time.

30:56.681 --> 30:59.580
If we move now, Dimitrov will
know that he's not getting Bardov.

30:59.617 --> 31:02.721
Then he'll just go back into
hiding, and this will just continue.

31:02.744 --> 31:04.161
How much time do you need?

31:04.281 --> 31:06.631
30 minutes. Just 30 minutes,
and this will be done.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.241
It'll be over, forever.

31:08.268 --> 31:10.398
All right, we'll do our best, Dorn,
but I've got to tell you something.

31:10.399 --> 31:12.677
I don't know if he's
going to last 30 minutes.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.281
Is this the cop, Commander
Bergen, the suicide?

31:25.401 --> 31:26.641
Suicide?

31:26.761 --> 31:29.041
I thought they said he was
killed in the line of duty,

31:29.401 --> 31:31.761
taken hostage or something like that.

31:33.309 --> 31:36.681
Have you ever seen a suicide
not leave any gunshot residue?

31:36.684 --> 31:38.161
I don't know about suicide.

31:38.441 --> 31:41.201
All I know is they don't want any autopsy.

31:43.717 --> 31:45.199
We are the police.

31:45.481 --> 31:47.201
The truth is what we say it is.

31:47.321 --> 31:50.605
<i>The truth is what we say it is...</i>

32:12.001 --> 32:13.401
This is ending.

32:14.174 --> 32:15.961
But before it ends,

32:16.579 --> 32:20.001
I'm going to spend some
precious time with your wife.

32:20.921 --> 32:22.479
I want you to know that.

32:25.081 --> 32:28.345
If you touch my wife, I will kill you.

32:29.195 --> 32:31.721
Now that's funny.

32:34.441 --> 32:36.001
One of them just hit the Major again.

32:36.121 --> 32:37.721
Be more specific. Which one?

32:37.841 --> 32:39.681
I'd like to give him a
little something special.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.241
The one with blood on his face.

33:04.281 --> 33:05.848
Hickman, we've got to go!

33:06.086 --> 33:07.086
What's going on?

33:07.201 --> 33:09.482
The Major got himself free.
He's going after them himself.

33:10.925 --> 33:12.177
Yes, Hickman?

33:12.187 --> 33:14.001
Things have changed,
Dorn, we've got to move.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.601
Save them. Save them.

33:17.437 --> 33:18.801
Lennon!

33:19.265 --> 33:21.854
We're on! Right, lads, let's go to work.

33:31.173 --> 33:33.643
Come on, lads, quick as you can!

33:49.641 --> 33:51.081
Right, that's going to
let them know we're coming.

33:51.093 --> 33:54.047
Hickman, take McConnell to the right.
The rest of you, on me, to the left.

33:54.081 --> 33:55.465
This way.

35:43.328 --> 35:44.521
We're here.

35:45.321 --> 35:47.481
Pleasure doing business with you, Dorn.

35:47.517 --> 35:49.841
Nothing about this has been a pleasure.

35:49.961 --> 35:51.761
I'm truly sorry you feel that way.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.001
You targeted a child.

35:54.019 --> 35:56.161
I wanted to do something loud.

35:56.553 --> 35:59.361
The Daniel family were your weakness.

35:59.397 --> 36:01.361
The boy was collateral damage.

36:02.187 --> 36:03.561
Goodbye, Dorn.

36:39.984 --> 36:41.161
It's over.

36:45.641 --> 36:46.396
How did you...

36:46.424 --> 36:50.503
Drones aren't the only vehicles
that can be operated remotely.

37:01.358 --> 37:02.681
How did you find me?

37:02.694 --> 37:05.556
We've had a satellite tracking
you ever since we met at that...

37:05.676 --> 37:08.090
bar with the nearly naked ladies.

37:08.803 --> 37:11.154
We've recovered Louis and Rebecca.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.761
They're safe.

37:13.138 --> 37:15.406
Bardov is back in a cell.

37:16.241 --> 37:17.521
Listen to this.

37:18.863 --> 37:21.321
I wanted to do something loud.

37:22.041 --> 37:24.681
The Daniel family were your weakness.

37:24.707 --> 37:26.841
The boy was collateral damage.

37:31.681 --> 37:33.601
This is your chance to surrender

37:33.643 --> 37:36.481
and face charges for the
murder of Étienne Daniel.

37:36.735 --> 37:38.041
Surrender?

37:39.361 --> 37:42.241
Dorn, you are in my country.

37:43.601 --> 37:46.561
How the hell do you think you
will ever get me across a border?

37:46.768 --> 37:48.601
I own this region.

37:48.761 --> 37:50.801
It would be more correct to say,

37:51.881 --> 37:54.606
"My brother-in-law owns all the criminals

37:54.641 --> 37:56.973
of Tula and the area around it."

37:57.093 --> 38:01.041
What I am offering you
is protection from them.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.641
By arresting me?

38:03.166 --> 38:06.770
My brother-in-law is a
traitor to his people.

38:07.161 --> 38:08.721
His days are numbered.

38:08.727 --> 38:10.041
One last time.

38:10.681 --> 38:14.041
Walk out with me, and you will live.

38:14.535 --> 38:18.401
If you don't, I cannot
guarantee your safety.

38:18.888 --> 38:20.081
Go to hell.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.881
And if you think you will
ever get out of Russia,

38:24.221 --> 38:26.721
you are as foolish as you are old.

38:27.248 --> 38:29.424
Tomorrow I will be older,

38:30.019 --> 38:32.251
and you will not.

38:34.641 --> 38:36.281
One call, Dorn!

38:36.401 --> 38:41.698
One call, and you will never
leave these woods. Never!

39:23.396 --> 39:26.149
I knew you would come for us, Carl.

39:27.548 --> 39:28.881
Thank you.

39:29.414 --> 39:31.961
I was asked today if
I knew what it was like

39:33.401 --> 39:35.194
to have someone believe in me

39:36.761 --> 39:38.401
when no one else did.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.841
- What a day, huh?
- Yeah.

40:09.836 --> 40:11.756
Good job, everybody.

40:14.521 --> 40:15.641
Ah...

40:18.506 --> 40:20.345
ICC Hickman.

40:24.003 --> 40:25.484
Are you sure?

40:27.103 --> 40:29.721
Yeah, thanks. Thank you.

40:35.682 --> 40:38.401
Anne Marie's mother went to the morgue with

40:38.521 --> 40:40.903
DNA samples already processed.

40:41.023 --> 40:44.160
Already? How could they be so fast?

40:44.280 --> 40:46.091
Her mother was a doctor.

40:47.307 --> 40:50.911
She had Anne-Marie genetically
tested for autism when she was a kid.

40:52.393 --> 40:54.286
So then they...

40:55.121 --> 40:57.048
- the DNA...
- It's a match.

41:02.532 --> 41:04.013
So the body...

41:04.471 --> 41:06.501
is Anne-Marie?

41:10.536 --> 41:14.185
The body got picked up two hours
ago. It's on the way back to France.

41:32.871 --> 41:34.441
I forgot my phone.

41:35.401 --> 41:37.545
- See you there.
- Okay.

42:08.481 --> 42:10.161
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:11.049 --> 42:13.427
I'm sorry, I just forgot my phone.

42:19.363 --> 42:20.681
You okay?

42:21.403 --> 42:23.241
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

42:30.041 --> 42:31.921
She was going to be a special one.

42:35.342 --> 42:37.161
She was smart.

42:39.732 --> 42:42.241
She asked a lot of questions.

42:43.684 --> 42:45.485
The good ones.

42:45.687 --> 42:47.379
The right ones.

42:47.801 --> 42:48.801
Yes.

42:50.801 --> 42:51.801
I know.

42:56.753 --> 43:00.121
Back in the beginning of this, uh, team...

43:04.198 --> 43:07.361
Louis asked me if I wanted
to feel like a cop again.

43:15.238 --> 43:16.961
I did want that.

43:20.081 --> 43:21.081
Mostly.

43:22.361 --> 43:23.481
Mostly?

43:24.601 --> 43:26.121
This part I didn't need.

43:29.726 --> 43:31.841
The part where you lose someone.

43:34.967 --> 43:36.481
I guess...

43:38.818 --> 43:40.940
we were all kind of alone

43:42.092 --> 43:43.801
when the Major brought us together.

43:47.269 --> 43:48.801
I was.

43:53.059 --> 43:56.081
Sebastian, Tommy...

44:00.614 --> 44:02.544
You had your own things.

44:02.883 --> 44:04.881
That's an understatement.

44:09.321 --> 44:11.001
Maybe what he meant by

44:11.521 --> 44:14.321
"feeling like a cop again"

44:15.681 --> 44:17.441
was being part of a family.

44:24.321 --> 44:26.761
When you are a family,
sometimes you lose people.

44:29.224 --> 44:31.281
But you don't have to lose them alone.

44:34.035 --> 44:35.241
Yeah.

44:37.281 --> 44:38.281
Maybe.

44:44.161 --> 44:46.121
Why don't you come with us for a drink?

44:47.133 --> 44:48.521
For Anne-Marie.

44:52.118 --> 44:53.241
Okay.

44:57.734 --> 45:00.681
Maybe now that we're family, I
can start calling you Carlton.

45:00.724 --> 45:03.641
- Or not.
- Okay. Or not.
