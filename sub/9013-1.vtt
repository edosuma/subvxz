"See the world," they say.
I left one shit hole for another.

00:32.967 --> 00:36.829
I was gonna be number one,
kick some ass, show 'em how it's done.

00:36.929 --> 00:39.154
Then dust off with bigger fish to fry.

00:49.651 --> 00:51.886
It's funny how when you think
you know it all,

00:51.986 --> 00:54.661
that's when you know you don't know shit.

02:27.665 --> 02:29.510
Corporal Albright?

02:30.677 --> 02:32.111
How'd you guess?

02:32.211 --> 02:35.907
Corporal Hansen. Welcome to the Kingdom,
brother. You good to go?

02:36.007 --> 02:39.282
- 100%.
- Follow me.

02:50.021 --> 02:51.047
No Humvees?

02:51.147 --> 02:54.659
Nah, man, this ain't fleet,
we roll low profile here.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.924
Makes the locals a lot less jumpy.

02:57.654 --> 03:00.606
- Makes sense.
- So where are you from, Albright?

03:00.706 --> 03:04.561
- Indiana, originally. You?
- Everywhere.

03:04.661 --> 03:08.723
Old man was a lifer,
spent 12 of his 20 as an MSG.

03:09.123 --> 03:10.275
No shit?

03:10.375 --> 03:13.150
So growing up in the corps
wasn't enough for you?

03:13.486 --> 03:17.531
What can I say, man.
I'm a devil pup, it's in the blood.

03:33.815 --> 03:36.468
Here we are. Home sweet home.

03:37.068 --> 03:39.554
What the hell?
I thought this place had cooled off.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.839
You should've seen it a year ago.

03:42.907 --> 03:47.837
Ah, don't worry, it's the same faces
every day. They're all bark and no bite.

03:47.937 --> 03:51.925
Shit does hit the fan, these dudes
are the twirling in the blades.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.618
The local Royal Guard.

03:53.918 --> 03:58.783
They man the perimeter, anything
outside of that, that's their rodeo.

04:13.479 --> 04:15.874
Yo, dawg.

04:17.675 --> 04:20.803
- What's crackalacking, homes?
- Mohammed, my man.

04:20.903 --> 04:24.724
- This is Albright. He's joining the squad.
- Welcome to the crib, chief.

04:24.824 --> 04:27.694
Anything you need, you let
this guy know, I hook it up, okay?

04:27.994 --> 04:30.605
I got more connections than the Internet.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.815
- Appreciate it.
- Get the fuck outta here.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.367
Peace out.

04:48.097 --> 04:51.376
Here we are. Home sweet home.

04:51.476 --> 04:54.071
If you say so.

05:07.984 --> 05:09.561
You ever have any trouble
here aside from them?

05:09.661 --> 05:13.064
Not since the Ambassador helped
the rebels turn this place around, no.

05:13.164 --> 05:15.733
They don't call him
the "peacemaker" for nothing.

05:15.833 --> 05:18.561
He managed to convince everybody
in the sandbox to play nice and...

05:19.011 --> 05:22.949
so far it's been working. You never know,
y'all could be in for a smooth tour.

05:23.049 --> 05:25.910
What about that mall bombing that's all over
the news a few weeks ago or whatever?

05:26.010 --> 05:27.954
That was like 200 miles north of here.

05:28.054 --> 05:31.104
It might as well be 1,000
if you ride around on a goat.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.877
- Get his big ass. Get his big ass.
- Get it.

05:33.977 --> 05:37.236
- Damn!
- That's how we roll.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.263
We do have this kind of trouble, though.

05:41.859 --> 05:45.009
- Evan Albright.
- The new guy.

05:45.405 --> 05:46.848
Good to meet you.

05:46.948 --> 05:49.851
- That's Ski over there.
- What's up?

05:52.245 --> 05:55.940
- How y'all doing?
- Evan here. Your new bunkmate.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.443
Oh, shit. Hey.

05:58.543 --> 06:00.737
How you doing, man?
Ray Lopez, Los Angeles.

06:00.837 --> 06:02.197
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah, good to meet you.

06:02.297 --> 06:05.033
Quantico must really be scraping
the bottom of the barrel these days.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.577
Look, you gotta excuse
brother Stamper here, okay?

06:07.677 --> 06:09.821
He goes straight for the throat.

06:09.921 --> 06:11.789
Come on, man.
Let me show you your new digs.

06:11.889 --> 06:15.401
Ignore these fools.
Hey, tell your sister I said hello.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.213
- Hansen, you're up, man.
- All right.

06:18.313 --> 06:21.549
Well, it ain't much, man,
but mi casa es su casa.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.907
I've had worse.

06:26.571 --> 06:29.849
Hello? Hey, baby.

06:29.949 --> 06:34.479
Yeah, yeah, I know, but, baby, I told you,
you gotta handle your moms, all right?

06:34.579 --> 06:39.617
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I'm working.
I hear my CO coming, I think.

06:39.917 --> 06:41.569
Lopez, let's go! Get in formation!

06:41.669 --> 06:46.491
Yeah, you see? I'm sorry, baby. I gotta...
Yeah. I gotta go. I gotta go.

06:46.591 --> 06:50.328
All right, baby, ya estÃ¡. SÃ­, te amo. Bye.

06:51.554 --> 06:55.554
Okay. You, bro, you,
you get Lakers tickets, man.

06:57.268 --> 07:00.848
Come on, man, you gotta get changed.
We gotta go check you in.

07:04.359 --> 07:09.389
Yeah, so, Gunny beats
to a bit of a different drum,

07:09.489 --> 07:12.517
but, you know, if all hell breaks loose,
he's the guy you want riding shotgun

07:12.617 --> 07:14.310
to go and fight the devil,
if you know what I mean?

07:14.410 --> 07:16.062
You name the Suck, he was there.

07:16.162 --> 07:20.133
FallÅ«jah one and two,
Helmand with MARSOC for, like, two tours.

07:20.233 --> 07:24.553
Yeah, I mean, like I said,
he's one bad motherfucker.

07:33.529 --> 07:35.359
Yeah.

07:37.225 --> 07:39.795
Yeah, our new guy coming through.

07:47.694 --> 07:49.936
Albright. How was the ride in?

07:50.196 --> 07:52.766
It was good to go, Gunnery Sergeant.

07:53.208 --> 07:56.978
Well, I'm sure Hansen's just happy
not to be the new guy himself anymore.

07:57.078 --> 07:59.438
I'll leave you two at it.

08:01.566 --> 08:05.945
I read your file.
You're a good Marine. Strong marks.

08:06.045 --> 08:07.488
A real hard charger.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.783
I'm just another Marine looking to serve
his corps and his country, Gunnery Sergeant.

08:10.883 --> 08:12.702
Don't give me that shit.

08:12.802 --> 08:16.762
You're good and you know it,
otherwise you wouldn't even be here.

08:17.890 --> 08:21.511
You're still thinking
of going Force or MARSOC?

08:21.611 --> 08:23.463
Maybe. After this.

08:23.563 --> 08:26.961
Yeah, I get it. You wanna be
the real deal, high-speed operator.

08:27.191 --> 08:31.179
Rock star commando. Test yourself,
see what you're made of, right?

08:31.279 --> 08:33.597
I'm just looking to serve this country,
Gunnery Sergeant.

08:33.698 --> 08:36.501
Well, in the meantime,
I need to know that your head...

08:36.601 --> 08:40.522
is where it needs to be,
in the here and in the now.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.442
Roger that, Gunnery Sergeant.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.231
Look, you gotta remember,
it is a privilege

08:46.331 --> 08:49.322
to get to come and work
in places like this, Albright.

08:49.422 --> 08:53.185
So, do yourself a favor,
experience the culture and...

08:53.285 --> 08:56.297
find out what it's all really about
instead of what some...

08:56.397 --> 09:00.924
corporate-funded media is selling
to keep you in a constant state of alert.

09:03.061 --> 09:06.531
It is important to maintain
good relationships.

09:06.631 --> 09:08.675
We're not just the face
of the Marine Corps here,

09:08.775 --> 09:11.803
we are the face of the entire US of A.

09:11.903 --> 09:14.305
Understood, Gunnery Sergeant.

09:14.405 --> 09:18.184
- Good. Dismissed.
- Dismissed, aye-aye, Gunnery Sergeant.

09:18.284 --> 09:21.024
Good afternoon, Gunnery Sergeant.

09:34.759 --> 09:37.153
So you wanna tell me why
I'm in blues and you're not?

09:37.253 --> 09:39.583
You'll see.

09:47.981 --> 09:50.842
Well, welcome to Post One.

09:50.942 --> 09:53.687
The only secure way
in and out of the chancery.

09:53.787 --> 09:56.181
All the classified hard drives
get stored in there and...

09:56.281 --> 10:00.018
as you know, our number-one mission as
embassy guards is to protect that material.

10:00.118 --> 10:03.688
- Roger that.
- All right, Ski, we're headed up.

10:03.788 --> 10:06.058
Roger that.

10:13.198 --> 10:15.618
Hansen, who's this?

10:18.052 --> 10:22.832
And that is Kraus,
the Regional Security Officer.

10:22.932 --> 10:25.627
- The Fed.
- Yeah, State Department, you know.

10:25.727 --> 10:28.421
He's operational supervisor
under Ambassador Cahill.

10:28.521 --> 10:32.575
And he's where us lowly SMGs here
really get our direction from,

10:32.675 --> 10:34.227
but he's pretty much an asshole, so...

10:34.327 --> 10:37.597
I tend to just try and walk
in the opposite direction.

10:37.697 --> 10:39.557
Excuse me, Miss Winston?

10:39.657 --> 10:42.335
Shane, please, it's Olivia.
How many times do I gotta tell you that?

10:42.435 --> 10:44.437
Right. Sure. Sorry, Miss Winston.

10:44.537 --> 10:47.482
I want y'all to meet the new Marine
here, Corporal Albright.

10:47.582 --> 10:50.401
- Miss Winston.
- What's with you jarheads, huh?

10:50.501 --> 10:54.864
Miss Winston is a digital security director.
She gets you in the system.

10:54.964 --> 10:58.293
- I look forward to working with you, ma'am.
- You keep calling me ma'am, Hoosier boy,

10:58.393 --> 11:00.537
and you're not gonna be working
anywhere much longer.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.934
- Hoosier. You did your homework.
- Of course.

11:03.034 --> 11:05.986
We have to run a background check
before you ever even get here,

11:06.086 --> 11:08.586
but maybe with you
we should check you again.

11:08.686 --> 11:09.921
Maybe.

11:10.021 --> 11:14.258
Over 64 inches tall, more than 18 months'
time on station, first class PFT,

11:14.358 --> 11:19.230
financially stable, 38 months
obligated service, and you're single.

11:19.530 --> 11:22.440
Like a rolling stone, ma'am.

11:24.169 --> 11:25.670
Yeah, you're all clear.

11:25.770 --> 11:30.024
Aside from that high level of maturity,
judgment and sound moral character part.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.485
That part we might
still need to work on a little.

11:32.585 --> 11:35.705
- I'll look forward to it, ma'am.
- I'll bet you will.

11:35.805 --> 11:37.695
Okay.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.910
You're so barking up the wrong tree
right there, my friend.

11:41.010 --> 11:43.104
Many have tried and many have failed.

11:43.204 --> 11:46.082
- I do like a challenge.
- Whoa. Hey, hey, boys. Um...

11:46.182 --> 11:49.636
Great. Can I just ask you a few questions?
I'm shooting footage for the embassy blog.

11:49.736 --> 11:50.920
You work here?

11:51.020 --> 11:53.464
Yeah, Blake Laureano.
I work for the Ambassador.

11:53.564 --> 11:56.159
- Hey, you're filming this?
- I'm filming everything and everyone.

11:56.259 --> 11:59.479
Just getting some thoughts on how
it feels to work a world away from home.

11:59.679 --> 12:02.182
What have you learned so far? Anything?

12:02.282 --> 12:05.185
Worship the Ambassador,
learn to like playing video games,

12:05.285 --> 12:07.378
guard Post One, avoid the RSO,

12:07.478 --> 12:11.049
and don't try to date the cute computer lady
because that's apparently a lost cause.

12:11.149 --> 12:14.069
That's awesome. I gotta go.

12:14.585 --> 12:17.065
Yeah, so do we.

12:23.336 --> 12:26.789
There he is. In the flesh.
Ambassador Cahill.

12:26.889 --> 12:28.091
Take a seat.

12:28.391 --> 12:31.136
- You ever talk to him?
- Yeah, man. All the time.

12:31.236 --> 12:35.840
"Yes, Mr. Ambassador. No, Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador."

12:35.940 --> 12:38.092
Practice that and you'll be fine.

12:38.192 --> 12:42.247
- Tracking.
- All right. Then you're ready.

12:42.347 --> 12:45.475
- For what?
- For why you're wearing blues.

12:45.575 --> 12:47.835
Your first mission.

12:48.853 --> 12:51.940
...that I did not have new shoes.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.320
My parents said that we didn't have
enough money for new shoes.

12:56.528 --> 12:59.461
And that made me sad. But then one day,

12:59.561 --> 13:03.243
I met a new friend
who said he liked my old shoes.

13:03.343 --> 13:09.457
That's when I realized that new friendships
were better than new shoes.

13:09.557 --> 13:11.827
Great. Well, thank you very much.

13:15.563 --> 13:18.967
That's okay. Thanks. It's great
to see you. Thank you for coming.

13:19.067 --> 13:22.354
And thank you, ma'am. Good to see you.
Thanks very much. Well done.

13:22.454 --> 13:23.721
Thank you.

13:23.821 --> 13:26.166
So, day two in the Kingdom,
correct, Corporal Albright?

13:26.266 --> 13:27.292
Yes, Mr. Ambassador.

13:27.392 --> 13:31.154
Well, nice job. You'd be surprised
how far a bit of compassion goes.

13:31.354 --> 13:33.064
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

13:33.164 --> 13:36.384
All right, kids. Let's go.
Let's get some ice cream.

13:40.113 --> 13:43.992
So, Stamper, tell me what the best
thing about embassy life is.

13:44.092 --> 13:47.871
The best thing about embassy life?
Showers.

13:47.971 --> 13:51.165
When Sunshine comes in
with that coconut shampoo, man...

13:51.265 --> 13:55.135
You got jokes, huh?
Man, pass me the goddamn salt, man.

13:56.688 --> 14:00.341
Now, look, this is the best part
about embassy life.

14:00.441 --> 14:05.362
This right here, this is how you never
leave home no matter where you're at.

14:05.822 --> 14:09.152
- Gumbo is ready, fellas! Come and get it.
- Gumbo.

14:12.245 --> 14:16.447
- Welcome to the bayou.
- Oh, nah, I'm good, man.

14:16.582 --> 14:19.903
- What?
- I'm allergic to gluten. So...

14:20.003 --> 14:21.771
Uh, you're allergic to gluten, huh?

14:22.171 --> 14:24.457
- Man, get your ass outta here, man.
- Hey, hey, man!

14:24.557 --> 14:26.077
Allergic to gluten.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.587
Okay, okay. Now, tell us,
why did you join the Marines?

15:19.687 --> 15:22.966
Why do you think?
'Cause I piss red, white and blue.

15:23.066 --> 15:25.885
My dad served and my pawpaw before him.

15:25.985 --> 15:29.164
I'm a gunfighter raised
in a family of gunfighters.

15:29.264 --> 15:32.383
Seriously, man, come on.

15:32.783 --> 15:35.295
Tell us. I want the truth.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.355
You can't handle the truth!

15:37.455 --> 15:40.733
No, another bad impersonation
of Jack Nicholson is what I can't handle.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.213
Come on, just tell us.

15:44.904 --> 15:48.624
I joined the Marines to prove myself.

15:49.217 --> 15:51.127
I joined the Marines to be the best.

15:52.996 --> 15:54.646
Move.

16:02.380 --> 16:04.132
Gunny. Gunny!

16:04.232 --> 16:06.534
Hey, stow that shit. We got work to do.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.621
These guys, they think
of you as like this Marine Buddha.

16:09.721 --> 16:12.332
What makes a great Marine?
Just give us one thing.

16:12.432 --> 16:14.584
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

16:14.684 --> 16:17.020
- High-fiber cereal.
- What?

16:17.120 --> 16:20.481
Because if you don't shit right, then you
don't sleep, walk or fight right, either.

16:20.581 --> 16:23.735
Healthy and regular defecation,
that is the key.

16:23.935 --> 16:27.075
And no, I'm not shitting you.

16:27.614 --> 16:30.934
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

16:32.368 --> 16:35.118
Chill, man. Chill.

16:41.461 --> 16:44.948
You hear it first.
Sleep tight. Shit right.

16:45.048 --> 16:46.366
#Oorah.

16:49.010 --> 16:50.370
All right, Marines.

16:50.470 --> 16:55.919
Six militants have just stormed this
raggedy-ass old embassy you see behind me.

16:56.534 --> 16:59.921
They now have the Ambassador trapped
somewhere on the second floor.

17:00.021 --> 17:02.557
Mohammed and his Royal Guard,

17:02.657 --> 17:06.886
who generously allowed us to use
their training facility as our own,

17:06.986 --> 17:09.055
will be playing the roles
of the terrorists.

17:09.155 --> 17:11.516
Fucking typecasting.

17:11.616 --> 17:16.438
And yours truly will be playing against
type in the role of the Ambassador.

17:16.538 --> 17:19.078
- Good to go, Gunny.
- Roger that.

17:20.282 --> 17:22.060
Let's bring it in.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.109
Go upstairs.

17:26.731 --> 17:29.321
- Check.
- Check.

17:31.727 --> 17:33.747
- Check.
- Check.

17:38.810 --> 17:40.170
Argh!

17:40.270 --> 17:42.500
Okay, okay.

17:42.605 --> 17:44.741
- Slow down, man.
- Hey, slow down.

17:44.841 --> 17:48.181
- Albright, stay in formation.
- Albright!

17:48.611 --> 17:51.990
Get the fuck back here.
Hey, come back here!

17:52.590 --> 17:53.885
Albright!

18:02.834 --> 18:05.654
- Shit, that hurts!
- Fucking hurts.

18:07.255 --> 18:10.425
I'm shot. I'm out, I'm out.

18:16.139 --> 18:19.150
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Back off, Albright!

18:19.350 --> 18:21.570
Drop it!

18:22.245 --> 18:24.565
Let him go!

18:26.324 --> 18:27.425
Ow!

18:27.525 --> 18:29.444
- Shit!
- Lucky...

18:36.993 --> 18:38.943
Son of a bitch!

18:40.722 --> 18:42.674
Look at that shit.

18:42.874 --> 18:46.386
Congratulations.
You just got your team killed.

18:46.586 --> 18:49.915
Yeah, no shit. This is the Middle East,
not the Wild West.

18:50.015 --> 18:53.827
- You're a goddamn cowboy.
- You were the one that breached, Albright.

18:53.927 --> 18:56.930
You breach and you immediately turn,
head on a swivel.

18:57.030 --> 19:00.570
That corner was you. Your responsibility.

19:02.327 --> 19:04.687
All right, guys, pack it up.

19:06.064 --> 19:08.133
Not you, Albright.

19:08.233 --> 19:10.413
Fuckin' hotshot.

19:11.294 --> 19:13.738
Hey, if your ass
didn't still owe me money,

19:13.838 --> 19:16.683
I might've used a real gat
on you, white boy.

19:16.783 --> 19:20.053
Nobody says "gat" anymore. It's a gun.

19:20.161 --> 19:22.534
Casualties might be all right
with the government

19:22.634 --> 19:25.258
as long as their assets are safe,

19:25.358 --> 19:28.278
but they are not all right with me.
Are we clear?

19:28.378 --> 19:30.538
Roger that, Gunnery Sergeant.

19:31.089 --> 19:34.175
You don't always have
to be first, Albright.

19:34.275 --> 19:37.965
Sometimes being a good Marine
means coming in last.

19:50.708 --> 19:53.845
- Here we go, boys. Here we go.
- Oh, shit.

19:53.945 --> 19:56.821
- About time.
- Here we go.

19:58.074 --> 20:01.986
- Okay. All right, I got Wolf Man.
- You know who I got, man.

20:02.436 --> 20:05.558
I got Dracula. Stamper's got Mummy.

20:06.291 --> 20:10.528
- What are you talking about?
- It's this little game we play, right?

20:10.628 --> 20:13.064
So every day,
this kid comes by selling falafels,

20:13.164 --> 20:17.727
and every day one of these hajis
takes a bite, spills half of it on his lap.

20:18.519 --> 20:20.571
Protestors gotta eat, too.

20:20.771 --> 20:24.392
Here's the drill, boys.
Next Tuesday, a new GTA comes out.

20:24.492 --> 20:26.769
- Winner gets first week king of the couch.
- All right.

20:26.869 --> 20:30.329
- Check it out. Pita time.
- Shit.

20:31.816 --> 20:33.727
- Here we go.
- Come on, Bubba Ho-tep,

20:33.827 --> 20:36.844
- you falafel gobbling high priest, you.
- Oh, man.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.165
Drac's got this one today, I can feel it.

20:39.365 --> 20:41.768
- Hey, man, let me see those for a second.
- There you go, baby.

20:41.868 --> 20:44.671
- There you go. Come on, bitch.
- No, come on, man.

20:44.771 --> 20:46.898
No, no, no, no. Drac's got this one today.

20:46.998 --> 20:50.684
Take a bite. There you go.
That's what you need.

20:51.072 --> 20:53.071
There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

20:53.171 --> 20:55.131
- No, Wolfie's gonna come through.
- Come on, baby.

20:55.231 --> 20:57.242
Get some.

20:57.842 --> 21:00.870
- Fuck.
- King of the couch, bitches.

21:00.970 --> 21:04.316
- Holy shit, I've seen that guy before.
- What the hell are you talking about?

21:04.416 --> 21:05.917
That cameraman,
I think he was just filming us.

21:06.017 --> 21:08.307
What cameraman?

21:10.255 --> 21:13.475
Oh, man. No, that's just somebody with,
I don't know, Al Jazeera or something.

21:13.575 --> 21:15.593
Trying to get the people's
perspectives, you know.

21:15.693 --> 21:19.681
No, he was watching us, the gate,
not them, not the protestors.

21:19.781 --> 21:22.000
It's the same guy I saw watching me
and Hansen when I first got in.

21:22.100 --> 21:25.503
Bullshit. How do you figure you can tell one
of these fucking rag heads from another?

21:25.603 --> 21:26.571
I can tell.

21:26.671 --> 21:30.525
FNG still trying to catch the bad guys,
trying to be a big hero.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.444
Hotshot looking to get shot.

21:32.544 --> 21:34.349
- You're damn right.
- I don't know. Look, Albright,

21:34.449 --> 21:38.258
any one of these guys even thinks about making
a move for the gate, they become targets.

21:38.358 --> 21:43.497
They never do. They know the drill, man.
Why don't you chill out and grab a beer?

21:44.222 --> 21:47.817
- That's bullshit, right there.
- That ain't even in his lap.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.962
- My cushion's on that couch, baby.
- I got your couch right here, baby.

21:51.062 --> 21:53.656
Look, take your ass downstairs,
go clean my couch.

21:55.808 --> 22:00.255
And you're positive? There were no
camera crews near the US Embassy?

22:00.797 --> 22:02.727
Thank you.

22:33.363 --> 22:35.256
Can we get the tribal leaders
from all sides there?

22:35.356 --> 22:38.643
- Excuse me, Mr. Ambassador, sir?
- Yes, Corporal Albright.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.678
I thought you might wanna
have a look at this.

22:40.778 --> 22:43.798
I think I saw this guy filming
the perimeter outside.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.622
You think so or you know so?

22:50.722 --> 22:52.949
Well, I think so.
He was at a distance, but...

22:53.049 --> 22:56.820
- So you're not 100% sure?
- 100%, sir? No.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.130
All right. Well, you must be mistaken.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.074
But I called all
the news stations in the area

23:01.174 --> 23:03.968
and none of them had a film
crew anywhere near here.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.898
And what did Raines or Kraus have to say?

23:07.222 --> 23:10.062
I thought you'd wanna see it first, sir.

23:11.376 --> 23:14.245
I'm aware of the potential dangers
of working here,

23:14.345 --> 23:17.715
I know there's a lot of people who wanna
destroy the trust we've built up in the region.

23:17.815 --> 23:22.654
But my job here is to build bridges,
and people trust me to do my job.

23:22.754 --> 23:26.141
You have to trust the people
around you to do theirs.

23:26.241 --> 23:28.226
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

23:28.326 --> 23:31.496
All right. Good man. All right, Rashmi,
I want you to be there as well.

23:31.596 --> 23:36.018
It's very important that we see
that a woman can be there working...

23:44.759 --> 23:47.395
I'm telling you, I know what I saw.
It's bullshit.

23:47.495 --> 23:49.080
But you need to chill, all right?

23:49.180 --> 23:52.970
That's why I brought you out here,
to get your mind off bullshit.

23:53.726 --> 23:56.616
- Hold on a second.
- Let's go eat. I'm starving.

23:59.691 --> 24:02.097
And what do you think, man? Which one?

24:02.197 --> 24:04.324
I don't know. For your daughter?

24:04.424 --> 24:08.183
No, man, for me. You see, I was thinking
of sipping some malt liquor later, so.

24:08.283 --> 24:11.444
Hey, she's gonna be 16 one day. Maybe
you should get her one of those burkas.

24:13.846 --> 24:17.142
- You're an asshole, man, you know that?
- Yeah, I know.

24:17.542 --> 24:21.822
I think I'm gonna get her this.
She'll like this.

24:23.006 --> 24:24.836
Dick.

24:52.827 --> 24:55.330
Fuckin' John Wayne.

25:08.376 --> 25:11.702
You think there's a threat,
then you're supposed to let me

25:11.802 --> 25:15.328
or RSO Kraus know, follow protocol.

25:15.808 --> 25:18.378
You went straight to the Ambassador.

25:18.478 --> 25:22.290
I'm... I'm sorry, Gunnery Sergeant.
I just thought...

25:22.390 --> 25:25.540
No, that's just it.
You didn't think, did you?

25:26.644 --> 25:29.572
Look, we get reports
like this here or worse on a daily,

25:29.672 --> 25:32.434
but now Kraus is so pissed
you went over his head with it,

25:32.534 --> 25:34.986
he's probably not even gonna
take it seriously, and that's on you.

25:35.086 --> 25:37.739
- That's bullshit.
- No. You're bullshit.

25:37.839 --> 25:41.601
All you care about is yourself and trying
to be some kind of goddamn rock star.

25:42.101 --> 25:45.572
I joined the Marines when I saw ISIS
lopping off heads and burning people alive.

25:45.672 --> 25:49.680
- I love my country.
- I know your story, Albright.

25:50.510 --> 25:54.089
Never knew your dad, your mom OD'd,

25:54.589 --> 25:59.169
bounced in and out of foster care, people
just moving you from school to school.

25:59.269 --> 26:03.757
You were always getting your ass kicked so
you learned to kick ass back. Am I right?

26:03.857 --> 26:06.392
It was just you, wasn't it?

26:06.492 --> 26:08.952
You against the world.

26:09.696 --> 26:12.932
Well, it can't be
just you no more, Albright.

26:13.032 --> 26:15.062
Not here.

26:16.286 --> 26:17.816
What's this?

26:18.663 --> 26:20.899
Transfer orders, devil dog.

26:20.999 --> 26:24.680
You wanna be an army of one, well, okay.
I'm gonna give you what you want.

26:31.509 --> 26:34.245
I got nowhere else to go.

26:34.345 --> 26:36.114
I got nothing else.

26:36.614 --> 26:39.493
You think you're the first Marine
that life's dealt a shitty hand?

26:40.193 --> 26:41.703
Huh?

26:41.803 --> 26:46.063
You better figure out what you really want,
Marine, you better figure it out quick.

26:48.418 --> 26:50.468
Dismissed.

26:52.005 --> 26:54.435
I said dismissed.

27:03.374 --> 27:07.164
Yes, man. Go, man.
That's my boy. All right.

27:07.737 --> 27:09.387
Yeah.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.990
Can I get a shot of Jameson, please?

27:25.688 --> 27:28.174
So how'd it go with Raines
and the boys today?

27:28.274 --> 27:31.131
Nothing like a little abduction to
make you see the error of your ways.

27:31.231 --> 27:32.737
I heard.

27:32.837 --> 27:36.532
You should've went through the proper
chain, but I did check your guy out.

27:36.891 --> 27:39.410
Are you sure this is who you saw?

27:39.510 --> 27:43.665
Six hours ago I was.
Now, I don't know what I know anymore.

27:43.765 --> 27:45.567
Yeah, well, his name is Khaled al-Asiri.

27:45.667 --> 27:48.478
He was the leader of the local militant
group with loose ties to ISIS,

27:48.578 --> 27:51.689
was the mastermind behind countless
jihadi attacks throughout the Kingdom.

27:51.789 --> 27:55.043
Just last month he used his little brother
as a suicide bomber to blow up a mall

27:55.143 --> 27:58.571
in the northern territories.
Killed 60 innocent people.

27:58.671 --> 28:00.123
I heard about it.

28:00.223 --> 28:03.093
So why does everyone seem so convinced
that it wasn't him I saw, then?

28:03.393 --> 28:06.838
Because he was taken out
in a drone strike two weeks ago.

28:06.938 --> 28:08.465
How do you know all this?

28:08.565 --> 28:11.685
Because maybe, like you,
I've got bigger aspirations.

28:24.706 --> 28:28.451
- Hey, about today, man...
- No, I get it. It was on me.

28:28.551 --> 28:31.742
- It's all right. It had to happen.
- All right.

28:31.842 --> 28:33.795
Come on.

28:40.138 --> 28:42.899
All right. There he is. There he is.

28:42.999 --> 28:45.159
John Wayne.

29:17.709 --> 29:20.745
- Buzz the door.
- I just need you to sign him in, sir.

29:20.845 --> 29:24.721
Like I give two shits what you need.
See, he's got what you didn't,

29:24.821 --> 29:28.069
an actual meeting with the Ambassador.
Now open the door.

29:46.971 --> 29:48.791
What's up, chief?

29:49.894 --> 29:52.819
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You need to take a dump or something?

29:52.919 --> 29:55.547
Kraus just came in with some local.
Total red flag.

29:55.647 --> 29:59.351
They had guns out, super serious,
refused to sign him in.

29:59.451 --> 30:01.436
Well, he's probably
just still pissed at you.

30:01.536 --> 30:05.467
Thinks you made him look like a dumbass
going over his head like that.

30:06.599 --> 30:09.239
Hey, what the hell is that?

30:12.063 --> 30:14.775
This is Post One.
What's going on out there, Mohammed?

30:15.375 --> 30:19.211
I don't know. Looks like some
foolish rookie just busted down.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.024
You mind taking a closer look
to make sure?

30:23.124 --> 30:25.344
I'm on it.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.747
It's him.

30:53.429 --> 30:55.740
A dead man. Shit!

30:55.840 --> 30:57.770
Yo, where are you going, man?

31:02.530 --> 31:05.030
It's a set up, get away from the van!

31:07.911 --> 31:10.131
Get away from the van!

31:15.335 --> 31:17.103
Get away from...

31:32.043 --> 31:36.303
- Are those gunshots?
- Don't move! Come on, let's go.

31:36.539 --> 31:39.429
- Kraus?
- Hold fast, sir. We'll be back.

31:56.376 --> 31:58.796
Allahu Akbar!

32:07.262 --> 32:10.673
- What the fuck is going on?
- We got tangos inbound.

32:10.773 --> 32:13.685
They have just exploded the front gate.
Multiple hostile.

32:13.785 --> 32:16.671
Lock it down, Albright!
Get to the safe room! We'll meet you there!

32:16.771 --> 32:18.852
Marines, get your shit together!

32:40.962 --> 32:43.432
- Lock it down!
- Yes, sir.

33:21.419 --> 33:23.696
- So this shit is real.
- Yeah, it's real, all right.

33:23.796 --> 33:26.336
Get your game faces on.

33:28.051 --> 33:31.141
- This shit is real.
- Hurry it up!

33:34.057 --> 33:36.797
All right, devil dogs. Let's move!

33:44.776 --> 33:46.928
You know what to do, people.
Let's get those carts full.

33:47.028 --> 33:48.736
- Let's move it, quick as we can.
- What?

33:48.936 --> 33:51.557
Olivia, all those MSC files...

33:51.657 --> 33:54.685
all the government communications,
pack them up.

33:54.804 --> 33:56.521
- What are we...
- All right, Blake, shut that down.

33:56.621 --> 33:58.615
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, no, yes.

33:59.115 --> 34:01.725
Rashmi, get those computers down.

34:04.395 --> 34:07.449
Full lock down going down!
Please report to designated areas!

34:07.549 --> 34:11.369
This is not a drill.
I say again, this is not a drill.

34:11.469 --> 34:14.848
Full lock down going down!
Please report to designated areas!

34:14.947 --> 34:18.545
This is not a drill.
I say again, this is not a drill.

34:21.411 --> 34:24.732
- Go, go, go.
- I'm going as fast as I fuckin' can.

34:27.451 --> 34:30.127
Come on, man. Get in.

34:30.630 --> 34:32.460
Got it.

34:37.277 --> 34:40.023
We gotta move. We gotta get outta here.
Gotta go, people.

34:40.123 --> 34:41.498
- What? We're leaving?
- Jamal?

34:41.599 --> 34:45.495
All right, Jamal, you're coming with us.
Let's go. Come on, move it.

34:45.795 --> 34:48.844
- Let's move it! Let's move it!
- How long are we gonna be gone?

34:48.945 --> 34:50.413
- Everyone ready?
- Do I need my cell phone?

34:50.513 --> 34:52.529
Come on, Blake, keep up.

34:53.043 --> 34:55.454
Ready? Let's do it.

35:01.728 --> 35:05.090
- Oh, shit, guys. They're coming through!
- Open this door! We're coming out!

35:05.190 --> 35:08.927
- I'm gonna go find the Ambassador.
- You, you, you're on me.

35:09.027 --> 35:11.012
I'll roll with Hansen,
get these drives to the incinerator.

35:11.112 --> 35:13.840
- Good luck.
- Yeah, don't be a fucking hero.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.500
Ready? Let's move.

36:11.598 --> 36:15.338
I got you. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

36:20.490 --> 36:24.735
Ski, don't die on me. No.
No, no, no, no, no. Don't die on me.

36:58.502 --> 37:00.622
Is that a bomb? Are they coming?

37:00.722 --> 37:02.665
- Watch out. Come on!
- It's them, right?

37:02.765 --> 37:06.044
They're coming, guys. Let's go.
What's going on?

37:06.144 --> 37:08.554
Okay, it's good. Come on, Olivia.

37:09.189 --> 37:11.049
Let's go!

37:11.691 --> 37:15.101
Holy shit! Holy shit!

37:16.270 --> 37:17.722
Let's go!

37:17.822 --> 37:20.052
- Holy shit!
- Come on, Blake.

38:00.865 --> 38:02.677
Argh!

38:11.075 --> 38:13.353
So I guess you were right.

38:13.453 --> 38:15.703
And so were you.

38:16.272 --> 38:18.663
- On me.
- Roger that.

38:23.780 --> 38:25.457
They call it the incinerator.

38:25.557 --> 38:29.753
It's this flame thrower thing they got here
to just torch anything that's classified.

38:30.453 --> 38:32.713
Man, I hope that's not classified.

38:32.856 --> 38:35.383
When the Ambassador is,
like, burning shit,

38:35.483 --> 38:39.102
- you know some heavy shit is going down.
- You could help us, you know?

38:40.572 --> 38:43.042
- Shoot!
- It's just us.

38:43.533 --> 38:45.184
You all right, Mr. Ambassador?

38:45.284 --> 38:48.505
So far. What's going on out there?
Who are these people?

38:48.605 --> 38:51.475
You know exactly who it is.

38:52.016 --> 38:54.344
- Is this everybody?
- Today, yeah.

38:54.444 --> 38:56.171
All right. Come on,
we need to get to the safe room.

38:56.271 --> 38:58.948
- Okay, time to strap me up.
- Seriously?

38:59.048 --> 39:00.875
Yeah, I shot guns before, dude.

39:00.975 --> 39:03.720
Strap me up, let's roll.
We got some business to take care of.

39:03.820 --> 39:06.331
- Come on, let's move.
- Let's go.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.711
Come on, Jamal.

39:12.829 --> 39:14.799
Clear!

39:29.120 --> 39:31.070
Oh, shit.

39:32.448 --> 39:34.108
Where's Ski?

39:34.584 --> 39:36.570
- He's dead?
- And what about Kraus?

39:36.670 --> 39:40.162
Him, too. And his team.
They blew an opening and made it inside.

39:40.262 --> 39:42.617
- Dozens of them.
- Khaled al-Asiri isn't dead.

39:42.717 --> 39:45.718
- What?
- This was all planned.

39:46.446 --> 39:49.086
I'm 100% now, sir.

39:50.475 --> 39:53.386
- Sir, we need to go.
- Safe room.

39:57.123 --> 39:58.983
Last man.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.943
Clear!

40:08.785 --> 40:11.187
Backup was asked for,
but they seem real hesitant

40:11.287 --> 40:13.423
to wanna throw anybody else in this fire.

40:13.523 --> 40:17.360
- That's Pete Raines's post?
- Yes, it is, and Ambassador Cahill's house.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.654
Does he have any backup?
Any players in the game down there?

40:19.754 --> 40:21.994
No, sir. Just some embassy Marines.

40:23.174 --> 40:24.859
- Security guards?
- Yes, sir.

40:24.959 --> 40:27.529
Most with limited to no combat experience.

40:28.529 --> 40:31.358
They're gonna get an ass-full now.
Where's Captain Dekard?

40:31.458 --> 40:34.127
The infirmary, sir. He's got appendicitis.

40:34.227 --> 40:38.790
Roger that. Well, I guess
I'm gonna take his seat, then.

40:38.890 --> 40:42.034
Sir? You're gonna lead the team?

40:42.134 --> 40:45.013
- You have a problem with that?
- No, sir.

40:45.113 --> 40:48.800
Then make the call, Hutch. Let me know
when the helos are ready for dust off.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.680
Yes, sir.

40:59.185 --> 41:00.965
Hey, you're in my shot.

41:09.971 --> 41:11.656
Welcome to the safe room.

41:12.056 --> 41:15.018
This is the safe room?
I thought it'd be bigger.

41:15.118 --> 41:17.998
Hansen, secure that door.

41:19.647 --> 41:24.047
Ronin, Ronin, this is Charlie 1.
I need to speak to your CO now.

41:28.022 --> 41:30.875
Who the hell is this haji? No offense.

41:31.075 --> 41:33.663
My name is Jamal al-Asiri

41:33.763 --> 41:36.817
and you're right,
I am one of the faithful.

41:37.067 --> 41:39.446
He's Khaled al-Asiri's brother.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.634
- They're here for you, aren't they?
- They're here for all of us.

41:47.984 --> 41:49.753
Yeah? Then why the hell are you here, huh?

41:50.153 --> 41:53.164
They said he had a meeting with you,
Mr. Ambassador. What for?

41:53.264 --> 41:56.301
To convince him that
our little drone attack had failed...

41:56.701 --> 42:00.605
and to tell him
that my brother is still alive,

42:00.705 --> 42:06.210
and now my wife, my children,
my entire family is in danger.

42:06.310 --> 42:10.273
I'm sorry, Jamal. All the intelligence we
had assured us that your brother was dead.

42:10.573 --> 42:12.753
Not all of it.

42:14.385 --> 42:17.414
Patching you through now, Gunnery Sergeant.
Go for Major Lincoln.

42:17.914 --> 42:21.484
- Glad to have you with us, sir.
- Likewise. How bad is it?

42:21.584 --> 42:23.053
It's pretty bad, sir.

42:23.153 --> 42:26.823
We are completely overrun and held up
in the safe room with the Ambassador,

42:26.923 --> 42:28.850
a few of his staff,
and a handful of my Marines.

42:29.050 --> 42:32.629
Roger that, Gunny. What intel
can you give me on the tangos?

42:33.029 --> 42:38.209
Not much. Uh, motivated, well-organized,
and kitted out for a stand-up fight.

42:38.309 --> 42:40.837
You keep shit locked down
till we get there?

42:40.937 --> 42:43.357
- What do you mean "we," Major?
- Come on, Pete,

42:43.457 --> 42:47.132
you didn't think I was gonna let you have
a party down there without me now, did you?

42:47.819 --> 42:51.969
- Locked and loaded, then, sir.
- See you within the hour, Gunny.

42:52.490 --> 42:54.717
Okay. MARSOC is en route.

42:54.817 --> 42:57.687
- Mohammed said he'd get help, too.
- He made it through?

42:57.787 --> 43:01.524
They're still an hour away.
So until then we're on our own.

43:01.624 --> 43:03.601
Who the hell are "they"? What's MARSOC?

43:03.701 --> 43:07.655
- Marine Corps Special Forces.
- The bad asses who got our backs.

43:07.755 --> 43:10.784
And what if we're dead in the next hour?
What happens then?

43:10.884 --> 43:13.128
Well, then we won't need
to worry about what ifs.

43:13.228 --> 43:14.921
How did this happen?

43:15.021 --> 43:20.752
Mr. Ambassador, the room will hold.
It's the safest place to be right now.

43:20.852 --> 43:24.230
I can't say the rest of this place
will still be standing around us, though.

43:24.330 --> 43:25.950
They're going through everything.

43:29.335 --> 43:31.872
What the hell do they think they're doing?

43:32.572 --> 43:36.715
They want to show America and its allies
the face of what they have caused.

43:38.486 --> 43:39.847
What?

43:39.947 --> 43:44.319
You think men like my brother just woke up
one day and decided to hate the West?

43:44.592 --> 43:47.187
You think that they do not feel
like America is the terrorist?

43:47.287 --> 43:52.900
Hey, suck it, Ali Baba. Don't even try to
feed us that jihadi propaganda bullshit.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.912
I know you hear me.

43:56.012 --> 43:59.825
I know you think you are
under attack from evil invaders.

44:00.225 --> 44:04.112
And yet it is my home
that you have invaded.

44:04.812 --> 44:08.532
And now you have even
invaded my own family.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.263
My brother, he was a true jihadist.

44:13.363 --> 44:17.084
A warrior. Until you poisoned him.

44:17.784 --> 44:20.812
Until our blood is no longer the same.

44:21.512 --> 44:23.523
You hear me, brother?

44:23.623 --> 44:25.909
We are no longer the same.

44:26.209 --> 44:31.156
You are dead to the father,
and dead to the son,

44:31.256 --> 44:34.826
and will soon be dead to all.

44:36.594 --> 44:38.830
Jesus, we're in the middle
of a goddamn civil war here.

44:38.930 --> 44:40.980
No shit.

44:41.266 --> 44:44.210
He knows I provided the intel
for the drone strike.

44:44.310 --> 44:48.360
This is revenge for him against all of us.

44:49.374 --> 44:52.443
Cause and effect, my friends.

44:52.543 --> 44:55.513
- Sir, we need to get out there.
- What?

44:55.613 --> 44:58.349
What part of "safe house"
is it that you don't understand?

44:58.449 --> 45:01.569
You saw 'em just now. They're gonna
take this place apart piece by piece.

45:01.669 --> 45:04.564
There's still classified materials out there,
things we haven't had the chance to get.

45:04.664 --> 45:08.109
There's at least 40-plus armed militants
in between us and your office right now.

45:08.209 --> 45:10.570
- We'll never get anywhere near it.
- He's right.

45:10.670 --> 45:14.808
It's not in my office.
It's in the Ambassador's residence.

45:15.608 --> 45:19.875
What's in there, sir?
Is it really that important?

45:23.141 --> 45:29.147
In a safe, there's Khaled al-Asiri's
cell phone. Jamal gave it to us.

45:29.247 --> 45:31.716
It has information on Khaled's
entire organization.

45:31.816 --> 45:34.052
Names, whereabouts, plans, everything.

45:34.152 --> 45:38.306
It could save lives, stop the next 9/11,
take down the entire group.

45:38.406 --> 45:42.965
We go out the south exit at the rear of the
embassy. It's a quick sprint from there.

45:51.185 --> 45:53.880
All right, boys, new plan.

45:53.980 --> 45:56.408
- Snatch and grab.
- Seriously?

45:56.508 --> 45:58.843
It has information that needs
to be uploaded to a data cloud

45:58.943 --> 46:02.156
and then wiped clean immediately.
I'm the only person that knows how to do it.

46:03.156 --> 46:04.796
I'm in.

46:06.643 --> 46:09.704
- Lopez, Hansen?
- Shit.

46:10.204 --> 46:13.758
- What about us, sir?
- Your job is to keep these people safe.

46:13.858 --> 46:16.738
Speaking of which,
Olivia's gonna need your vest.

46:23.993 --> 46:26.396
Roger that. That's was a Royal Guard.

46:26.496 --> 46:29.691
- Boots on the ground?
- Yes, sir, their special response regiment.

46:29.791 --> 46:31.893
They're sending in a platoon
to back our boys up now.

46:31.993 --> 46:34.237
A platoon? That's it?
That's all you could get?

46:34.337 --> 46:37.825
I couldn't get anything, sir.
The embassy Marines did this.

46:44.973 --> 46:47.792
A Marine goes down on duty,
they call it an act of valor.

46:47.892 --> 46:51.938
A civilian at the US Embassy,
that's a national tragedy.

46:52.038 --> 46:56.098
Now, she's a civilian,
she's also your team now.

46:56.234 --> 47:01.019
It's not just you against the world no more,
Albright, it's you against them.

47:01.906 --> 47:04.787
- Hansen, on me.
- Roger.

47:51.014 --> 47:53.454
I got two guys out front.

48:10.233 --> 48:12.491
All right, Gunny, we're in place.
Ready to roll on your say-so.

48:12.591 --> 48:14.176
Roger that, stand by.

48:14.604 --> 48:17.906
Okay, when I open this door,
we're just gonna run and keep running

48:18.006 --> 48:19.884
and we're not gonna stop
until we hit the residence.

48:19.984 --> 48:23.336
I'm all for saving lives
and kicking ass and stuff, but...

48:23.436 --> 48:25.457
come on, man, they got an army out there.

48:31.478 --> 48:34.178
The Royal Guard ops arrived.

48:56.504 --> 48:57.982
Mohammed.

48:59.182 --> 49:00.932
Thank you, Jesus.

49:01.934 --> 49:03.694
Yeah, Mohammed, too.

49:08.408 --> 49:12.662
- Hansen, what's going on?
- We got local back up coming in hot.

49:12.996 --> 49:16.983
Couldn't have timed that better myself.
Albright, go. Go, go, go.

49:17.383 --> 49:20.779
- Ready?
- Just try and keep up.

49:38.521 --> 49:41.431
- That's my boys!
- Come on, Lopez.

49:54.929 --> 49:56.178
They're in.

50:00.885 --> 50:02.115
Move!

50:10.528 --> 50:14.168
Looks like your family tree's
about to lose a branch.

51:38.933 --> 51:41.203
Get out of here.

51:49.936 --> 51:50.979
Shit!

51:54.699 --> 51:57.784
- Little help here.
- I'm busy.

53:23.162 --> 53:25.223
Let's go!

53:25.623 --> 53:29.183
Come on, man, you stealing
the guy's wallet? Come on, let's go!

53:34.132 --> 53:37.042
They broke the lock trying
to get into it. It won't open.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.121
Give me a sit rep, Albright.

53:40.221 --> 53:42.957
- We're working on it.
- Well, work harder.

53:43.157 --> 53:46.959
- Well, what the fuck are we doing?
- We can't leave without it!

53:50.873 --> 53:52.923
Head down.

54:04.746 --> 54:08.108
Where the fuck is he?
I can't see him. Where is he?

54:08.208 --> 54:10.828
He's in the guard tower.

54:42.659 --> 54:46.471
- We should be out there with them.
- You'll get your chance.

54:46.871 --> 54:51.580
Jesus, by the time we get there,
there won't be anybody to extract.

55:19.237 --> 55:21.517
You think I'm afraid to die?

55:26.327 --> 55:28.563
If it is God's will,

55:28.663 --> 55:32.513
I will be welcomed into His paradise.

55:35.069 --> 55:36.821
Brother...

55:36.921 --> 55:43.061
the true Allah condemns
the evil you do in His name.

55:58.876 --> 56:00.954
Sa'ir, Abul.

56:03.506 --> 56:06.518
They're asking them for an update.
They must be talking about the phone.

56:06.618 --> 56:09.068
You speak Arabic, too?

56:16.361 --> 56:17.404
Let them know they're coming.

56:17.504 --> 56:20.834
Gunny, tangos headed towards
the Ambassador's residence now!

56:24.093 --> 56:27.523
Hansen, keep 'em busy.

56:28.473 --> 56:31.960
You got a heap of trouble headed your way,
Albright! Get the hell out of there!

56:32.060 --> 56:35.638
- We don't have the package yet!
- It doesn't matter! Get out of there!

56:39.083 --> 56:42.053
It doesn't matter. Just go!
Get the hell out of there!

56:42.153 --> 56:44.503
- We've gotta hold them.
- Come on.

57:12.851 --> 57:15.594
There's too many of them, Albright!
Get the fuck out of there!

57:15.694 --> 57:18.309
Roger that! We gotta go, Olivia! Now!

57:29.308 --> 57:30.658
Yes!

58:03.601 --> 58:05.251
Fuck!

58:08.781 --> 58:11.524
Got it! Got it! Let's move!

58:13.144 --> 58:16.247
- Package in hand!
- Then go, God damn it! Go!

58:16.347 --> 58:18.574
Lopez! Come to me! Come to me!

58:18.674 --> 58:21.534
- Moving!
- Move!

58:30.637 --> 58:32.497
RPG!

58:32.597 --> 58:36.148
Go, go, go! Shit!

58:39.704 --> 58:41.798
- Oh, shit!
- Jesus Christ!

58:41.898 --> 58:44.148
Can they survive that?

58:52.634 --> 58:55.745
We're out, but pinned down!
North side of the residence.

58:57.680 --> 59:00.907
Where's the north side monitor?
Anyone see them?

59:03.561 --> 59:05.991
Gunny, we're stuck. Where are you?

59:15.306 --> 59:18.476
Now, Albright! Now! Go, go!

59:42.183 --> 59:44.123
Christ!

59:49.440 --> 59:51.330
Gunny?

59:52.694 --> 59:54.893
Gunny, can you hear me?

59:55.972 --> 59:57.462
Gunny!

01:00:08.276 --> 01:00:09.726
Come in, Gunny!

01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:14.265
Gunny, come in!

01:00:14.365 --> 01:00:16.602
- He's gone, man.
- What?

01:00:16.702 --> 01:00:19.042
He's dead.

01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:21.272
Oh, man, fuck!

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:23.200
This is bullshit.

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.326
I said they're fucking gone!

01:00:25.426 --> 01:00:28.613
Okay? They're all gone.
Fucking Mohammed, all of 'em.

01:00:28.713 --> 01:00:30.523
What the fuck!

01:00:32.108 --> 01:00:34.228
You happy now?

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:38.289
At least four of my friends are dead!

01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:40.909
Is this fun for you?

01:00:41.993 --> 01:00:44.462
Do you wish you could be out there,
and be a part of it?

01:00:44.562 --> 01:00:47.882
Dave! Dave! Easy! Dave! Easy, Dave! Easy!

01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:51.394
Listen to me! That side shit
doesn't matter now, okay?

01:00:51.694 --> 01:00:53.431
They're coming for him, too.

01:00:54.631 --> 01:00:58.476
Well, maybe we should just hand him over,
man. See if they go away.

01:00:58.576 --> 01:01:01.763
Look, man. Chill.

01:01:01.863 --> 01:01:04.533
We don't have time for that.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:07.485
Today we gotta be on the same side.

01:01:07.585 --> 01:01:11.322
This is it. We're all gonna
fucking die, aren't we?

01:01:11.422 --> 01:01:13.700
Gunny was the only guy
that had his shit together.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.828
If Billy Bad Ass doesn't make it,
how the hell are we?

01:01:16.928 --> 01:01:18.955
We're all gonna fucking die!

01:01:19.055 --> 01:01:21.938
No one's gonna die, Blake.

01:01:23.326 --> 01:01:25.420
Corporal Albright?

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.673
- Corporal, what do you want us to do?
- What?

01:01:28.773 --> 01:01:30.759
You're asking him?

01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:35.180
No offense, Mr. Ambassador,
he just got here. He doesn't know shit.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.142
Yet he was the only one
of you who saw this coming.

01:01:39.242 --> 01:01:43.952
He was the only one of you who tried
to do anything to stop it from happening.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:49.213
We are so dead.

01:01:51.104 --> 01:01:53.644
What do you wanna do, Corporal?

01:02:01.764 --> 01:02:06.216
Say again your last? Say again your last?
You're coming in broken and stupid.

01:02:06.744 --> 01:02:10.690
- We got 'em.
- This is Major Lincoln. Who is this?

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:14.119
- Corporal Evan Albright, sir.
- We're all clear.

01:02:15.612 --> 01:02:19.722
- Where's Gunny Raines?
- Dead, sir.

01:02:24.245 --> 01:02:27.395
We could really use your help
right around now, sir.

01:02:28.374 --> 01:02:31.878
- We're inbound in 20 mikes.
- Twenty mikes?

01:02:32.378 --> 01:02:35.715
Hang in there, Marine. We will be there.

01:02:35.815 --> 01:02:39.553
- We'll get there as fast as we can.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:40.053 --> 01:02:43.797
You just keep the Ambassador and the rest
of those civilians safe until we get there.

01:02:45.617 --> 01:02:47.767
Will do, sir.

01:02:56.044 --> 01:02:58.284
He can't win.

01:02:58.796 --> 01:03:01.391
We've worked too hard
to go back to what was.

01:03:01.491 --> 01:03:04.791
I changed hearts and minds here.

01:03:07.347 --> 01:03:10.217
You know, I honestly believe that.

01:03:11.726 --> 01:03:14.136
I have to believe that.

01:03:16.314 --> 01:03:18.064
Something's burning.

01:03:20.985 --> 01:03:22.935
It's us.

01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:31.271
Shit, it's probably
from the explosion on the roof.

01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:36.094
- What kind of safe room is this?
- Well, obviously, it's not safe anymore.

01:03:55.545 --> 01:03:57.456
What are you doing?

01:03:57.556 --> 01:04:01.805
- This is classified, you shouldn't be here.
- I said, what are you doing, Olivia?

01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:04.596
I knew it.

01:04:04.696 --> 01:04:07.999
This is classified. You could be
court-martialed for even saying anything else.

01:04:08.399 --> 01:04:13.137
Hey. Gunny is dead. Ski is dead.
Mohammed is dead, Olivia.

01:04:13.237 --> 01:04:16.500
You really think I give a shit about
being court-martialed right now?

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.511
How much money is in there?

01:04:19.611 --> 01:04:22.530
It was enough to keep this place peaceful.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:25.074
So that's the Ambassador's magic touch.

01:04:25.174 --> 01:04:28.828
- A pile of cash.
- The Ambassador's a good man, Evan.

01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:31.706
He was asked to come here
and cool off a hot zone, and he did that.

01:04:31.806 --> 01:04:34.527
Yeah, 'cause it's just breezy
around here right now, isn't it?

01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:37.879
Democracy's a big machine,
this keeps her wheels spinning.

01:04:37.979 --> 01:04:42.425
Passion, dignity, hope, and money.
That's the way it works.

01:04:42.525 --> 01:04:44.786
- And now you're just burning it?
- We don't have a choice.

01:04:44.886 --> 01:04:47.372
If proof of this got out,
we'd lose all credibility in the region.

01:04:47.472 --> 01:04:50.141
No honor amongst thieves?

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:53.086
I don't have the luxury of looking
at things as black and white, Evan.

01:04:53.186 --> 01:04:55.233
Not out here. Nothing is.

01:04:55.343 --> 01:04:58.580
It's a lot easier for the world to end
as we know it than most people believe.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:02.422
We make the wrong move, hesitate
for a second when we shouldn't,

01:05:02.522 --> 01:05:04.169
and it's over.

01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:08.089
Oh, my God.
You're a fucking spook, aren't you?

01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:10.408
I'm a fucking realist.

01:05:10.508 --> 01:05:15.268
And my loyalty is to my country,
not my convictions.

01:05:34.215 --> 01:05:36.854
They're all over the place out there.

01:05:37.969 --> 01:05:40.657
- All this smoke coming from the roof?
- Yeah.

01:05:40.757 --> 01:05:43.964
We've done the best we could
to slow it down.

01:05:46.561 --> 01:05:48.763
Stamper, come in.

01:05:48.863 --> 01:05:50.713
Albright?

01:05:51.149 --> 01:05:52.667
How's everybody doing there?

01:05:53.067 --> 01:05:55.178
Hansen just made it back,
but we're fucked.

01:05:55.278 --> 01:05:58.389
The goddamned building's on fire.
We can hardly breathe in here.

01:05:58.489 --> 01:06:01.351
- MARSOC's still 20 minutes out.
- Oh, shit.

01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:03.845
I know, right?
It's like what happened at Benghazi.

01:06:03.945 --> 01:06:06.523
Everyone died of smoke inhalation.

01:06:06.623 --> 01:06:10.426
Let me tell you something, Blake.
If I go out here...

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:14.656
it sure as hell ain't gonna be
from sucking in no smoke.

01:06:14.756 --> 01:06:16.866
We're gonna have to handle this ourselves.

01:06:16.966 --> 01:06:19.327
You know we're still way fucking
outnumbered here, right?

01:06:19.427 --> 01:06:21.996
Yeah, I'm not waiting to get rescued
and I'm not waiting to die.

01:06:22.096 --> 01:06:24.499
We're getting the hell
out of here, all of us.

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:26.879
How?

01:06:27.268 --> 01:06:29.514
We're gonna slip out the back.

01:06:29.614 --> 01:06:32.674
Oh, check out the big brain on Brad.
Why didn't I think of that?

01:06:32.774 --> 01:06:34.317
The rear gate's theirs.

01:06:34.417 --> 01:06:38.721
There's a team of hajis out there with an
RPK just waiting for us to give that a try.

01:06:38.821 --> 01:06:41.850
- Can you make it there?
- Not directly. No fucking way.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:45.845
Yeah, I hate to say it, man,
but he's right. The whole place is infested.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.482
Our best option might be
the northeast fire exit.

01:06:49.882 --> 01:06:52.402
I don't know what the hell you guys
are talking about. You're just as fucked.

01:06:52.502 --> 01:06:56.339
You got tangos out front and two
tactical sitting on your back porch.

01:06:56.439 --> 01:06:58.733
The trucks are out back?

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.785
All right, you gotta move.
We're coming to you.

01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:03.872
Come to us? What the fuck
are you talking about, John Wayne?

01:07:03.972 --> 01:07:06.422
You gotta trust me, man.

01:07:08.926 --> 01:07:11.408
Stamper, you with me?

01:07:12.564 --> 01:07:15.049
- Goddamn cowboy.
- Fucking right!

01:07:15.149 --> 01:07:20.054
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
This is our house.

01:07:20.154 --> 01:07:22.640
Let's show these motherfuckers
how we do it.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.935
Let's show 'em! Let's get some!

01:07:25.535 --> 01:07:27.595
Excuse me?

01:07:27.996 --> 01:07:31.775
- Can I get a gun yet, please?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:07:31.975 --> 01:07:34.124
- Let's move.
- Okay.

01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:37.947
You better hope you know
what the fuck you're doing, man.

01:07:38.047 --> 01:07:41.637
Mr. Ambassador... let's roll.

01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:51.049
I guess we'll see which way
you run when that door opens, huh?

01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.881
- This is Albright, sir, we can't hold.
- Say again?

01:07:54.981 --> 01:07:59.127
This is Albright, sir, we can't hold.
We need to move. Need an alternate HLZ.

01:07:59.527 --> 01:08:03.022
Understood. What options do we have?

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.003
Al-Mafraq Stadium
is about two clicks away, sir.

01:08:08.203 --> 01:08:10.355
Al-Mafraq Stadium. You know it?

01:08:10.455 --> 01:08:12.649
That's a soccer stadium
10 blocks from here.

01:08:12.749 --> 01:08:17.002
- Roger that, sir. We'll see you there.
- Outstanding. Watch your ass, Marine.

01:08:17.553 --> 01:08:19.576
Aye-aye, sir.

01:08:35.087 --> 01:08:39.091
If someone finds this footage, please
YouTube it. The footage must live on.

01:08:39.192 --> 01:08:41.522
Shut the fuck up.

01:08:59.629 --> 01:09:01.416
Move.

01:09:49.304 --> 01:09:51.372
I ain't gonna lie, man. That's hot.

01:09:51.471 --> 01:09:53.292
Get in!

01:10:24.255 --> 01:10:26.441
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:10:26.541 --> 01:10:28.404
- Move it!
- Move!

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.672
Yousef! Yousef...

01:10:40.772 --> 01:10:43.255
- Move, move, move!
- Come on.

01:10:48.488 --> 01:10:51.007
- Stamper, we're 30 seconds out!
- So are we!

01:10:51.107 --> 01:10:55.187
- Over, headed your way!
- Almost there! We'll be there!

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:07.102
Come on.

01:11:23.565 --> 01:11:26.045
Where the fuck are you guys?

01:11:29.742 --> 01:11:31.434
We got company!

01:11:37.695 --> 01:11:39.481
Fuck!

01:11:39.581 --> 01:11:41.933
- Jesus. What the hell?
- Anytime today, Hansen.

01:11:42.033 --> 01:11:45.770
I'm trying! It's jammed! It won't open!
Stamper, open this fucking door!

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:49.844
No offense, sir.
Get the fuck out of the way! Back up!

01:11:53.761 --> 01:11:58.066
All right, keep your head down!
All right, move, move, move, move.

01:11:58.166 --> 01:12:00.056
Get in!

01:12:08.234 --> 01:12:10.654
Come on, let's go! Go, go, go!

01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:19.144
Go, go! Sunshine, go!

01:12:24.868 --> 01:12:26.958
Stamps!

01:12:27.562 --> 01:12:29.352
Fuck!

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:41.440
Come on.

01:12:41.643 --> 01:12:43.663
Come on, come on. We gotta go!

01:13:16.928 --> 01:13:19.658
God damn it, motherfuckers!

01:13:24.227 --> 01:13:25.987
We're almost there!

01:13:27.230 --> 01:13:29.310
Hang on!

01:13:30.575 --> 01:13:32.435
Shit.

01:13:47.041 --> 01:13:48.985
Albright to MARSOC, do you copy?

01:13:49.085 --> 01:13:52.955
Hello? Do you copy?
We are en route to extract. Over.

01:13:56.551 --> 01:13:59.033
Go, go, go!

01:14:32.587 --> 01:14:35.782
- Lack on ammo, need more mags.
- I got you.

01:14:41.012 --> 01:14:43.652
- Which way?
- That way.

01:15:59.958 --> 01:16:02.008
Sunshine!

01:16:03.052 --> 01:16:05.302
You're gonna be okay, man.

01:16:12.353 --> 01:16:15.089
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me.

01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:18.546
I got you. I got you. You're gonna be okay.
I got you. You're all right.

01:16:18.646 --> 01:16:22.052
You're all right. You're all right.
You're all right.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.134
You're okay.

01:16:57.106 --> 01:16:59.499
- Do you see them?
- No.

01:17:06.407 --> 01:17:07.809
Do you think they're gone?

01:17:07.909 --> 01:17:11.271
Trust me, they haven't gone anywhere.

01:17:11.371 --> 01:17:13.701
Hansen, check the back.

01:17:21.773 --> 01:17:25.413
Yeah, that's a negative.
They're holding the alleyway.

01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:27.901
There's a basement.

01:17:33.518 --> 01:17:37.028
Albright to MARSOC, do you hear me? Over.

01:17:38.106 --> 01:17:39.938
I don't know if you can hear me,
but we're pinned down.

01:17:40.038 --> 01:17:41.994
Cannot make extract.
Where the fuck are we?

01:17:42.094 --> 01:17:44.137
- At Freedom Burger.
- Where?

01:17:44.237 --> 01:17:48.337
We're at Freedom Burger
on Kings Road and Al-Hashimi.

01:17:53.955 --> 01:17:57.575
Jamal, grab that propane tank.

01:17:58.059 --> 01:18:01.039
- What? Why?
- Just take it to the bottom of the stairs.

01:18:05.592 --> 01:18:07.452
They're back!

01:18:13.808 --> 01:18:16.098
Everybody in the basement!

01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:42.251
Go!

01:18:53.014 --> 01:18:55.764
Okay. I got you.

01:19:42.564 --> 01:19:44.146
What the fuck!

01:19:48.068 --> 01:19:49.888
Fuck!

01:19:53.408 --> 01:19:56.028
I have to help them!

01:19:58.288 --> 01:20:02.027
- You're all right. You're gonna be all right.
- Give me a gun. I can fight.

01:20:03.251 --> 01:20:07.671
Khaled sent my younger brother, Amir,
to die when he was only 12.

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:10.325
Now my youngest brother is only eight,

01:20:10.425 --> 01:20:13.343
and I will not let him
play martyr for Khaled as well.

01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.110
Give him a rifle.

01:20:20.059 --> 01:20:23.878
- Seriously, he gets a gun?
- God damn it, Blake.

01:20:45.935 --> 01:20:48.213
There's nowhere for you to go.

01:20:48.313 --> 01:20:51.699
It seems your country will now have
to bear the burdens of your deaths.

01:20:51.799 --> 01:20:53.368
Go fuck yourself.

01:20:53.468 --> 01:20:56.788
After all, that is the tragic truth
of the matter, is it not?

01:20:56.888 --> 01:21:00.917
Your government takes pride
in the blood that stains its hands.

01:21:01.017 --> 01:21:04.796
What are yet more lives
in the pursuit of its foolish crusade?

01:21:04.896 --> 01:21:06.506
Crusade?

01:21:06.606 --> 01:21:10.885
You butcher innocents and use that to get
the rest to go along with your savage shit.

01:21:10.985 --> 01:21:15.532
You wanna bring it to us, to the devils
holding the guns, that I at least get.

01:21:15.632 --> 01:21:20.345
But a shopping mall, the towers,
journalists and aid workers?

01:21:20.445 --> 01:21:22.879
You're just a bunch of fucking pussies
too weak to even try

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:24.768
hitting anything that might hit you back.

01:21:24.868 --> 01:21:27.699
This is not that fight
for freedom, Khaled.

01:21:28.102 --> 01:21:30.637
This is just a fight...

01:21:30.737 --> 01:21:32.356
with no end...

01:21:32.456 --> 01:21:35.593
no winners and no hope.

01:21:36.594 --> 01:21:38.658
The only way...

01:21:38.758 --> 01:21:42.350
is to rid our land of every
foreigner that invades it...

01:21:42.450 --> 01:21:46.021
and to kill the rat
who calls himself my brother.

01:21:46.621 --> 01:21:48.090
Go, go!

01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:36.699
Cease fire.

01:22:40.116 --> 01:22:42.566
At ease, Marine.

01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:54.999
Ambassador Cahill.

01:22:59.085 --> 01:23:02.587
- Blake, put pressure on this.
- Ah!

01:23:06.726 --> 01:23:10.036
Major Lincoln, MARSOC.

01:23:10.146 --> 01:23:12.506
Are you okay, sir?

01:23:12.899 --> 01:23:15.953
Yes, Major, we are.

01:23:16.553 --> 01:23:18.503
Let's get you outta here, sir.

01:23:47.141 --> 01:23:50.021
It's for you, Miss Winston.
It's Director Walsh.

01:23:53.982 --> 01:23:56.801
Yes, sir. We have the package.

01:23:56.901 --> 01:23:59.191
Khaled is dead.

01:24:10.364 --> 01:24:14.194
There he is. The best. Billy Badass.

01:24:14.294 --> 01:24:18.990
His ass and the rest of the Marines
saved my ass in the furnace.

01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:22.420
So big thank you to Albright.

01:24:22.844 --> 01:24:24.371
Albright.

01:24:24.971 --> 01:24:26.491
Yes, sir.

01:24:27.582 --> 01:24:31.044
Hell of a job, Marine. Hell of a job.

01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:33.397
Your Gunny would be proud.

01:24:34.063 --> 01:24:35.799
Thank you, sir.

01:24:35.899 --> 01:24:38.593
You'll probably able to write
your own ticket after this.

01:24:38.693 --> 01:24:42.222
Hell, I can always use
another shooter I can count on.

01:24:42.322 --> 01:24:44.472
Let me know.

01:24:46.426 --> 01:24:48.812
- Patrick.
- Sir.

01:24:48.912 --> 01:24:52.107
Secure Mr. Cahill in the vehicle, please.

01:24:52.207 --> 01:24:55.187
- You better take a load off, all right?
- Thank you, sir.

01:25:01.966 --> 01:25:05.787
In the end... coming in first,
coming in last,

01:25:05.887 --> 01:25:10.207
none of it matters as long as you do right
by the soldiers standing next to you.

01:25:10.642 --> 01:25:13.937
Ain't it fucked up how we spend
so much time planning our lives,

01:25:14.037 --> 01:25:16.715
convincing ourselves
with what we wanna do,

01:25:16.815 --> 01:25:18.680
what we have to do?

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:22.303
But sometimes, we don't see
what we're meant to do.

01:25:23.154 --> 01:25:25.473
Staff Sergeant Albright?

01:25:25.573 --> 01:25:28.143
New guy coming through.

01:25:30.688 --> 01:25:34.250
So, Marine, how was the trip in?

01:25:35.305 --> 01:25:41.876
