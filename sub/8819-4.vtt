00:01.043 --> 00:02.336
NEAL: <i>Previously on</i> White Collar...

00:02.711 --> 00:05.589
Pink Panthers, the most dangerous
gang of thieves in the world.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.549
<i>Neal plans to infiltrate the gang.</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.676
I want a contract.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.137
Pink Panthers for my freedom.
It has to be ironclad.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.597
You deserve to.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.767
So, Woodford wants us to break into
this company called Atlas Tech.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.103
<i>Inside that vault is a digital</i>
<i>file named Exodus.</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.480
NEAL: <i>What's in the file?</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.732
PETER: <i>Looks more like</i>
<i>a complex algorithm to me.</i>

00:23.815 --> 00:25.609
It draws lines between variables,

00:25.692 --> 00:27.569
connecting them
in a seemingly arbitrary manner.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.113
PETER: International airports.
International airlines.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.408
So, whatever they're transporting
is going in and out of the country.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.826
It's almost an impossible heist.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.995
PETER: <i>Unless you have the algorithm.</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:19.580
NEAL: It looks like the Pink Panthers
have disappeared.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.248
Been no word for days.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.749
I've heard nothing from Luc.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.501
-What about Keller?
-Nothing.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.044
It's too quiet.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.380
Any chance that the Panthers
are onto you?

01:28.672 --> 01:30.090
Maybe Keller said something.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.135
If they were on to me, I'd be getting
a lot worse than the silent treatment.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.804
-Where were you this morning?
-Home.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.598
Came from a different direction.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.226
Okay, I see what's going on here.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.895
Oh, really?
Enlighten me.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.939
You're having separation anxiety.
It's totally natural.

01:46.023 --> 01:48.692
No, we're never separated enough
for me to be anxious about it.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.737
But without my anklet you can't
track my every movement,

01:51.820 --> 01:53.113
and it's driving you crazy.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.491
I'll admit I sleep better when
that dot tells me exactly where you are.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.118
I hear lavender's good for sleep.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.120
-I'll adjust.
-Maybe a sound machine.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.581
Let the crash of waves wash
away your anxiety.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.210
How about you worry more about the
Panthers and less about my REM cycles?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.420
If we don't take these guys down...

02:08.504 --> 02:10.297
What are you not telling me?

02:11.256 --> 02:13.675
I pushed for the Panthers case.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.386
I turned down FBI resources

02:16.470 --> 02:19.973
and guaranteed that we could
take them down on our own.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.475
I have to deliver.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.101
What happens if you don't?

02:24.228 --> 02:27.773
Mmm... Something along the lines of
an early retirement package

02:27.856 --> 02:29.274
and a box for my mugs.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.156
Where are we?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.742
We fed the algorithm from
the Exodus file into the computer

02:38.867 --> 02:39.993
and accessed the randomizer.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.537
-What'd you get?
-We don't know yet.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.580
We're working on decoding
the data, but it takes time.

02:43.789 --> 02:47.501
Well, we know the Panthers are targeting
something that's arriving at an airport.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.003
That could be anything. On a daily basis
you've got everything from

02:50.087 --> 02:53.966
jewels to currency to valuable
documents going in and out of airports.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.760
So we don't know what it is, when
it's happening, or at which airport.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.762
We do know the Panthers
have gone underground.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.389
I could try to draw them out.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.890
No, it's too risky.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.225
Keep working on the algorithm.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.143
That's our best shot at figuring
out what they're up to.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.147
NEAL: I got them the stamp
and the Exodus file.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.733
It doesn't make sense for
the Panthers to be shutting me out.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.279
Well, I've been told separation
anxiety is completely natural.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.697
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

03:16.989 --> 03:19.408
-Panthers?
-No, it's just Mozzie.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.742
PETER: Hmm.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.809
-Hey!
-You're late.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.187
Late for what?
What are you wearing?

03:48.270 --> 03:51.273
I received an anonymous message
at one of my drop sites this morning.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.817
Just a time, 10:23 a.m.,

03:53.901 --> 03:55.444
and a place, Brooklyn Promenade.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.946
And you think the message
is from the Pink Panthers?

03:58.030 --> 04:01.325
They're preparing for the big score.
Naturally, they want the best of the best.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.743
I think they're wooing me.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.078
I don't think they know
who you are.

04:05.329 --> 04:08.498
But can you blame them? You take
every precaution to stay unknown.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.294
But you've told them about my extensive
contributions, haven't you?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.713
-You haven't?
-It's complicated.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.132
The stamp?
The Exodus file?

04:17.216 --> 04:19.009
None of that would have happened
without my expertise.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
I know.
And you know how much I appreciate it.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.348
Uh, not enough to mention me
to your new friends.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.308
The Panthers aren't my friends.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.227
And they're not the gentleman
thieves they used to be.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.853
They're dangerous.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.688
I have a lot riding on this mission.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.482
I'm not even sure about my own
position in the group.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.359
I haven't been contacted in days.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.152
It's not the time to be
suggesting new recruits.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.779
Moz.

04:40.364 --> 04:43.116
-You're right.
-Thank you for understanding.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.119
No, no. Not about that. You should have
told the Panthers about me.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.871
But you're right.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.706
The message wasn't from them.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.375
Who was it from?

04:52.292 --> 04:55.712
It occurs to me now there's something
I may have failed to mention.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.381
All right, who am I looking for?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.636
Aubergine frock, reading a book.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.349
Who is that?

05:09.351 --> 05:11.270
Moz, who is she?

05:12.521 --> 05:14.189
She's my wife.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

05:39.715 --> 05:41.884
Wait. You have a wife?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.554
Yes. Technically I am united in matrimony.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.514
In the traditional sense?

05:47.598 --> 05:50.058
Yes. We were married by
a justice of the peace.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.894
A real one.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.022
I haven't seen her in five years,
since the honeymoon.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.481
Yeah, you never even mentioned her.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.193
I never found quite the right time.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.612
Wait, you said five years?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.947
Yes. I was at a low point.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.241
Me too, as I recall.
I was in prison.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.244
And I was out a best friend.
And a partner in crime.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.831
Did you know that 20% of people
meet their spouse at work?

06:13.081 --> 06:15.000
So you met your wife on a con?

06:15.334 --> 06:18.086
I was posing as a Finnish baron.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.424
<i>Opening night of</i> Il Trovatore <i>at the Met.</i>

06:22.841 --> 06:26.345
<i>My suit was tailored,</i>
<i>my cover was impeccable.</i>

06:26.428 --> 06:28.931
<i>But my heart wasn't in it,</i>

06:30.807 --> 06:34.311
<i>until I saw her.</i>

06:37.272 --> 06:39.691

<i>a young widow, the inheritor</i>
<i>of a sizable fortune.</i>

<i>Lonely, wealthy, a perfect mark</i>
<i>for my sweetheart con.</i>

06:49.785 --> 06:51.912
<i>We had a whirlwind romance.</i>

06:51.995 --> 06:54.873
<i>After only a few days together,</i>
<i>we rushed to the altar.</i>

06:54.957 --> 06:58.043
<i>The con was going perfectly.</i>

06:59.253 --> 07:02.297
<i>And then the real truth came out.</i>

07:04.049 --> 07:08.303
<i>We discovered we were both</i>
<i>pulling a sweetheart con on each other.</i>

07:08.470 --> 07:13.642
<i>But we had both successfully conned</i>
<i>an expert con artist,</i>

07:14.268 --> 07:17.980
<i>and that could be worth a fortune.</i>

07:21.650 --> 07:25.445
So we pooled our resources and went
on a honeymoon con to Morocco.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.740
I know this doesn't end with,
"And they lived happily ever after."

07:28.991 --> 07:34.079
No, our fairy tale ending was more
in the traditional German oeuvre.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.914
Tragedy, betrayal,

07:35.998 --> 07:38.417
diminutive man led astray
by a cunning vixen.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.211
Precisely.
She stole my half of the score

07:41.295 --> 07:43.547
and abandoned me
in a Marrakech train station.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.591
NEAL: That was the last you saw of her?

07:45.716 --> 07:48.218
Yet I always knew that she would return,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.847
groveling, wanting me back.

07:52.014 --> 07:55.058
Five years is a long time
to wait to grovel.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.728
Yeah, I should go it alone from here.

07:58.061 --> 08:02.065
If I'm going to break her heart,
I'm gentleman enough to do it privately.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.692
Of course.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.569
Let her down easy, Moz.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.994

by the appointed time.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.939
-You're out of practice.
-(LAUGHS)

08:42.022 --> 08:43.774
But you're not.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.528
I'm surprised you still have it.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.947
I wanted something to remember you by.

silver wasn't enough?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.994
-Eh, something sentimental.
-(LAUGHS)

08:58.080 --> 09:01.375
You are not the sentimental type.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.002
I'm not here to rehash the past.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.005
I wanna talk about the future.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.383
Ah.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.386
I'd be lying if I said I was surprised.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.304
You were expecting this?

09:14.555 --> 09:17.057
Of course.
You have to remember, Eva,

09:17.140 --> 09:20.227
people like you and me,
we're solitary hunters.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.771
We're like the African civet.

09:22.938 --> 09:26.984
Our musk is alluring, but we're
meant to prowl alone.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.902
Mozzie, I want a divorce.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.532
She's getting remarried.
Can you believe it?

09:33.615 --> 09:35.868
That's not what I'm having a hard time
wrapping my mind around.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.244
Did you know he was married?

09:37.327 --> 09:39.121
I was in jail when this happened.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.165
I was told to come home so
I could have lunch with my wife.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.209
-I'm here.
-Yeah, and here's lunch.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.837
Honey, will you get the plates?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.714
She was talking to me.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.632
Oh, but I know where the plates are.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.010
-Since when?
-He moved 'em before you got here.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.345
He creates chaos to cope
with change.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.723
Oh, and your spices are now
next to the sink.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.269
You all know I'm not a meddler,

10:02.352 --> 10:04.897
but Eva has left me no choice.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.982
Moz, I know this isn't easy,

10:07.107 --> 10:10.319
but if she's in love with somebody else,
you gotta let her go.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.989
Oh, is that your consensus?
That she's really in love?

10:14.156 --> 10:16.992
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I do
believe that's why people get married.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.330
Has my very existence not opened
your eyes to a more complex world?

10:21.496 --> 10:23.207
You really think she's conning this guy?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.919
Of course.
It's what she does, quite excellently.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.879
And what you do, with

10:30.130 --> 10:32.466
some skill, is stop that from happening.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.676
You want me to investigate your wife.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.222
I want you to stop Eva from
hurting another innocent victim.

10:38.847 --> 10:42.017
Are you sure this isn't about
her last innocent victim?

10:42.518 --> 10:44.811
I swear, my motives are pure.

10:45.062 --> 10:46.813
I've been doing some research.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.775
Her mark is named Jack Conroy,

10:49.858 --> 10:52.778
president of a charity for at-risk youth.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.863
Well, it is a bit hard to believe
that a con artist

10:54.947 --> 10:56.949
marrying the head of a charity
is just a coincidence.

10:57.199 --> 11:01.119
Exactly. The target is so obvious.
It's beneath her.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.621
Honey, do it for the kids.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.915
All right.
I will look into it.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.876
But you have to promise me
that you'll stay out of it,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.545
and you won't do anything stupid.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.422
Absolutely.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.723
Oh, good, you're here.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.393
Why am I standing in the lobby
of Jack Conroy's charity?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.103
I promised Peter we'd stay out of it.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.314
Technically, you didn't promise, I did.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.817
And the suit and I have our own
understanding about truth.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.903
-I'm leaving.
-No, no, you can't.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.783

requires a boy Friday.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.034
Who's Henry Staten?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.954
Mr. Staten, Mr. Conroy can see you now.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.791
I hear you're interested in making
a donation to our worthy cause.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.044
Considering it, but I don't want
to rush into anything.

11:51.128 --> 11:54.423
Yes, Mr. Staten is well aware
of how risky it can be

11:54.506 --> 11:56.258
to let emotions cloud
his better judgment.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.510
Of course, we want all our donors
to be well-informed.

11:58.594 --> 12:03.098
It's important to be aware of
what or whom I'm committing to.

12:03.557 --> 12:07.352
Sometimes an outsider's
expertise is needed.

12:07.436 --> 12:10.689
Like good friends, to let us
know when we're doing something stupid.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.900
I used to be a lot like you, Mr. Staten.

12:13.150 --> 12:15.944
Fancy cars I never had time to drive,

12:16.111 --> 12:19.031
wondering if all my hard work
would ever make a difference.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.618
And then one day everything changed.

12:23.619 --> 12:27.497
I was the victim of an armed robbery.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.627
And being the coward that I am, I ran.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.378
The shooter got me in the leg,

12:33.462 --> 12:37.174
and I realized the fear I felt
in that moment

12:37.341 --> 12:40.552
is what so many kids face every day.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.305
I mean, they live in war zones.

12:43.639 --> 12:48.268
And after this, I...
I felt a call to fight with them.

12:48.644 --> 12:52.105
There is still one serious concern.

12:54.358 --> 12:55.567
Your fiancée.

12:58.487 --> 13:00.405
We haven't announced our engagement.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.449
Oh, Henry's very thorough.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.203
Her name is Eva Perkins,
size seven shoe,

13:06.787 --> 13:08.789
Libra, allergic to peanuts...

13:08.872 --> 13:11.667
-Okay.
-And one other thing...

13:11.834 --> 13:13.377
She's a con woman.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.840
That's what you were gonna say, isn't it?

13:18.215 --> 13:22.427
Yes, we're concerned that Eva might be
using you to get to the charity's money.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.513
Yes, I know about her past.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.890
And you're wrong.
Eva is different now.

13:27.140 --> 13:31.520
Well, in my experience,
once a con, always a con.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.274
Well, if I didn't think people
could change, I couldn't do this work.

13:35.357 --> 13:38.402
And it's that belief
that makes you a good mark.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.571
I'm not naive, gentlemen.

13:40.863 --> 13:44.449
I know that charities are a ripe target.
That's why our accounts are protected.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.285
Not even I have access to them.

13:46.368 --> 13:47.995
Eva would find a way.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.830
She has bested some of the best.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.541
It's part of her magnetism.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.503
Sounds like you've had
the pleasure of meeting her.

13:56.587 --> 14:02.342
No, no. That's just conjecture
based on extensive research.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.511
Well then, we should fix that.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.556
We're hosting a gala tomorrow night.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.016
Come and see what we're about.

14:09.099 --> 14:12.394
And once you meet Eva,
I'm sure you'll love her.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.478
-(NEAL CHUCKLES)
-Oh...

14:15.939 --> 14:18.150
She's even better than I remember.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.278
Of course, if you're gonna con
a guy with a savior complex

14:21.361 --> 14:23.322
convince him that you need to be saved.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.740
It's genius.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.075
I don't believe it.

14:27.159 --> 14:30.037
-She's got you fooled too?
-Oh, I'm not fooled, I'm concerned.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.623
As am I.
Jack is clearly in too deep.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.542
For you. You're thinking
with your heart instead of your head.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.711
I'm not.
I know Eva.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.714
No, you knew her, Moz.
That was five years ago.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.591
Oh, people don't change.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.760
Look at you.
You went to prison,

14:44.843 --> 14:46.803
you got out and went right
back to the same game.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.971
We are who we are.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.973
And even we can be blinded by love.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.017
You know I've learned
that one the hard way.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.144
Ah! And who had your back all those times?

14:54.228 --> 14:55.896
You did, and I have yours now.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.814
If this is about saving a charity, I'm in,

14:57.898 --> 15:00.234
but if it's just about Eva,
you should walk away.

15:00.317 --> 15:01.485
Trust me.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.071
I require wisdom from
the nectar of the gods.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.739
You got it.
First pour is on me.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.076
Some journeys need
to be walked alone.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.276
(GRUNTS)

15:42.776 --> 15:46.113
You are not what I pictured
when Eva told me about her ex.

15:46.363 --> 15:50.909
I've got to say, Mozzie, her new
partner's definitely an upgrade.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.537
I knew it.
Eva hasn't changed.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.039
She's not in love.
She's still a con artist.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.751
Eva has moved on.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.421
I strongly suggest you do the same.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.966
People can get really hurt
if they refuse to let go.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.926
You can't threaten me.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.304
Blather all you want.
Who's gonna believe you?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.307
You're a conspiracy nut
and a criminal.

16:13.932 --> 16:18.854
Look, face it. In a game of you
against me, guys like me win every time.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.232
Guys like you, no one
even pays attention.

16:43.587 --> 16:45.506
I was right.
Mostly.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.925
I never should have let you drink alone.
What happened?

16:48.008 --> 16:50.511
I was attacked by Jack Conroy.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.930
He and Eva are in on it together.

16:53.222 --> 16:54.932
No, no, no, no.
I think you've had enough

16:55.015 --> 16:56.725
nectar of the gods for one night.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.769
I've never been of clearer mind.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.771
I should have seen it from the beginning.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.773
He was just too perfect.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.526
With that fake limp
and that real hair.

17:05.609 --> 17:08.862
If Jack and Eva are working together,
why would he come clean to you?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.448
I don't know.
Must I have all the answers?

17:11.532 --> 17:13.116
Isn't my bloodshed enough?

17:13.534 --> 17:14.952
You shed blood?

17:19.498 --> 17:20.916
I can see that you've suffered.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.378
He hit me exactly where he knew
you couldn't see it.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.671
Like he... Like he does it for a living.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.714
Then maybe you should leave this alone.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.092
No cost is too high for justice.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.635
You said you'd have my back.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.470
All right. I'll talk to Peter tomorrow.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.973
In the meantime, no more altercations.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.266
Really this time.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.226
-My wound needs a salve.
-I'm getting you band aids.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.109
NEAL: What's going on?

17:47.401 --> 17:49.069
We got the airport data
off the randomizer.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.529
Gave us the initials SFO.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.281
San Francisco International.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.575
They stole the algorithm,
now they've gone quiet.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.493
This could be the big score.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.537
Except it's going down this afternoon.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.831
The randomizer gave us the airline
and the flight number.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.375
The plane arrives today
at 2:30 p.m. Pacific time.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.794
JONES: There's another number, but we
can't figure out what it is.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.754
It could be some kind of
code to the shipment.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.716
Woodford cut me out.
You think Keller told them?

18:10.841 --> 18:13.177
You're the new guy.
Maybe they don't quite trust you yet.

18:13.302 --> 18:14.803
All that matters now is stopping them.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.848
Well, unless we can get our hands on a G6
there's no way to get there in time.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.017
All right, I'm putting
the San Francisco bureau on it.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.894
Get me their ASAC now.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.858
Look, this whole mission depends on
catching these guys in the act.

18:27.983 --> 18:31.195
-I'm gonna make sure that happens.
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)

18:33.822 --> 18:35.657
ASAC Rollins, Agent Burke.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.703
What? No.
I need to speak with ASAC Rollins.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.250
While you're on hold, there's another
matter that could use our help.

18:45.417 --> 18:48.712
-Let me guess.
-Mozzie had a run-in with Eva's fiancé.

18:48.879 --> 18:51.340
Of course he did.
I told you two to stay out of it.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.425
He attacked Mozzie after they met.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.553
-He attacked him?
-Mozzie claims he was beaten.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.057
Mozzie also claims the government uses
fluoride to control my mind.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.226
You said you would
look into the situation.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.937
Transferred to Seattle?
Why...

19:05.687 --> 19:08.815
I need to speak to whoever's
in charge, right now.

19:09.816 --> 19:10.817
(SIGHS)

19:11.068 --> 19:12.444
So you looked into Jack and Eva?

19:12.861 --> 19:14.238
They're clean,
as far as I can tell.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.281
-And the charity?
-Seems legit.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.075
And the accounts are secure.

19:18.242 --> 19:21.995
So even if they were pulling a con,
there's no way to access the funds.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.415
From my experience, whenever someone
says, "There's no way this is a con..."

19:25.541 --> 19:26.875
It's usually a con.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.503
This is Special Agent Burke.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.422
I'm the ASAC of the New York
White Collar division.

19:32.506 --> 19:34.591
My team and I are chasing
the Pink Panthers.

19:34.883 --> 19:39.763
We have intel that they're targeting
a plane coming into San Francisco at 2:30.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.098
Yes, today.

19:41.265 --> 19:44.226
Make sure he knows the Panthers can
sniff out feds from a mile away.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.104
I don't have to tell you the Panthers
are the best in the world.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.856
You'll need your top team on this.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.942
Great. My office will fill
you in on the rest.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.193
You'll know everything we know.

19:55.654 --> 19:58.740
Get everything we have on the Panthers
and coordinate with San Francisco.

19:58.824 --> 19:59.908
We're compiling it now.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.285
Should happen in
the next couple of minutes.

20:01.368 --> 20:04.121
I want updates on this every
half hour until it's over.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.539
Got it.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.169
We'll go crazy if we sit
here and watch the clock.

20:10.294 --> 20:11.712
We're back to Mozzie again.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.298
Well, he did help you find me
and bring down Booth.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.300
That earns him a few minutes
of government service.

20:16.967 --> 20:17.968

20:19.636 --> 20:20.888
What do you have in mind?

20:25.976 --> 20:28.353
This is not what I had in mind
when you said "stake out."

20:28.437 --> 20:30.355
-We can turn on the game if you want.
-There's no game.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.316
-Shh!
-No, it's my car.

the moment of truth.

capture are two people

more time in my car...

21:15.567 --> 21:17.361
<i>Because of Mozzie?</i>

<i>I should have mentioned this earlier.</i>

21:20.072 --> 21:21.949
<i>I ran into him yesterday.</i>

<i>How did you run into Mozzie?</i>

He's gonna come clean.

theories about you and me.

Oh, I should have known when
I asked him for a divorce

21:35.379 --> 21:37.005
he would do something crazy.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.342

Wait, hold on, hold on.

If this were my con I'd be
doing the same thing.

in case someone's listening.

21:59.695 --> 22:00.946
He's right.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.135
As you know, I am a reasonable man.

You didn't have to attack me so viciously.

22:25.596 --> 22:26.972
What's he talking about?

22:27.055 --> 22:29.892
I have no idea.
I thought we had a nice conversation.

23:13.352 --> 23:16.271
Well that doesn't prove anything.

23:20.526 --> 23:22.444
Mozzie, stop. Please.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.239
Haven't you
embarrassed yourself enough?

23:27.157 --> 23:28.158
Let's go.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.997
-EVA: <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-I will be vindicated.</i>

23:38.836 --> 23:41.964
I don't think this is what Mozzie meant
when he said "moment of truth."

23:42.214 --> 23:43.632
I think it is.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.843
I think Mozzie could be right.

23:53.141 --> 23:56.270
El's keeping an eye on Mozzie
until we figure out what's going on.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.521
What is going on?

23:57.604 --> 23:59.356
I'm not sure yet, but I've got a hunch.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.483
JONES: I've uploaded the photos.

24:01.567 --> 24:04.403
Based on the angle of the entry,
it looks like the bullet hit only muscle.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.904
No tendons, no ligaments.

24:05.988 --> 24:07.281
No permanent damage.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.949
Which means no limp.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.535
A shot like that, it's pretty lucky.

24:11.660 --> 24:14.496
Yeah, especially if Jack was
running away, which is what he claims.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.165
If he was running,
and the shooter was standing up,

24:18.083 --> 24:20.127
the bullet would have entered
at a down angle.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.920
Yeah, and this shot
looks straight across.

24:22.421 --> 24:24.381
Clean shot, no permanent damage.

24:26.008 --> 24:28.385
I think he did it himself.

24:28.552 --> 24:30.053
He's creating a story.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.931
Rich guy gets shot,
his life flashes before his eyes,

24:33.015 --> 24:34.892
he dedicates that life to others.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.270
Nothing like a come to Jesus moment to
get people to trust you with their money.

24:38.353 --> 24:39.980
Except it isn't about the money.

24:40.063 --> 24:42.191
The charity's accounts are secure.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.817
So what's their angle?

24:43.901 --> 24:45.485
Just got off the phone with San Francisco.

24:45.569 --> 24:47.738
All teams are ready
and waiting at the airport.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.948
Flight should be arriving at
a little more over an hour.

24:50.032 --> 24:52.701
Just stay on the phone with these guys
and keep me updated.

24:55.996 --> 24:57.664
This could all be over in a few hours.

24:57.748 --> 25:00.209
And here we are just twiddling our thumbs.

25:04.379 --> 25:07.216
If it would get you to San Francisco,
would you shoot yourself in the leg?

25:07.341 --> 25:08.425
What are you talking about?

25:08.717 --> 25:10.928
What if Jack's con is about location?

25:11.428 --> 25:13.931
He could be using the charity
to gain access.

25:14.223 --> 25:17.518
They're hosting a gala this
afternoon at a private gallery.

25:17.601 --> 25:20.103
Filled with artwork
worth millions of dollars.

25:20.395 --> 25:22.356
So they're not trying to rip off
the charity,

25:22.439 --> 25:24.441
they're trying to get close
to something they want to steal.

25:24.858 --> 25:27.528
If this is really their angle,
then Eva is as good as Mozzie says.

25:27.611 --> 25:28.820
I get what he saw in her.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.615
Get me an inventory of
the artwork at this gallery.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.492
-Let's go tell Mozzie he was right.
-No.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.202
You can do it.
Come on, now.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.954
I should've known.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.789
Love is the ultimate con.

25:39.665 --> 25:42.835
Just because it ended
doesn't mean it wasn't real.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.753
No, John Lennon was right.

25:44.837 --> 25:46.964
Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.

25:47.464 --> 25:50.634
His mythos had clearly been
affected by Paul's death.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.386
Look, I know you cared about her a lot,

25:52.469 --> 25:54.054
but you said it yourself.

25:54.137 --> 25:57.641
I mean, she stole your half of the score
in Morocco, and then took off.

25:57.850 --> 25:58.976
On your honeymoon!

25:59.059 --> 26:01.562
What could be better than that?
It was a brilliant play.

26:01.645 --> 26:03.730
Don't you want to be
with somebody you can trust?

26:03.981 --> 26:06.233
Trust is an illusory crutch

26:06.316 --> 26:09.653
required by those who take comfort
in false certainty.

26:10.028 --> 26:13.407
People like Eva and I,
we live for the game.

26:13.699 --> 26:15.033
So you thought she'd just come back

26:15.117 --> 26:16.869
and pick up the game
where it was left off?

26:16.952 --> 26:20.956
Only this time, I would be the one
who took off with her half of the score.

something about dogs and fleas,

flattery is my weakness.

I had any other option.

<i>Please.</i>

27:48.377 --> 27:50.337
Hey, where's Mozzie?

27:50.420 --> 27:52.256
I've been calling him on his phone
but he's not answering.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.507
He was just here. I...

27:53.590 --> 27:56.093
He said you were calling
and he stepped outside.

-Mozzie.
-Moz.

-Who do you think called him?
-Eva.

Well, it has to be the gala.
It's about to start.

Jack and Eva went through a lot
of hard work to set up the perfect plan.

It seems like Mozzie would be
getting in the way.

Yeah, they're not gonna want
to burn those covers just yet.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.420
She probably told you
she was in trouble.

Yeah, maybe she even claimed she's
in danger, that she's scared of Jack.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.425
And you believed her because
you know Jack is dangerous.

29:18.509 --> 29:20.135
Because Jack himself showed you.

29:20.219 --> 29:23.263

-Why me?
-Good question.

Jack is paranoid.
He knows I'm having doubts.

Only simple minds would fail
to see our connection.

He feels threatened by you.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.458
Understandably.

32:39.001 --> 32:41.587
And you know how dangerous
he can be when he's threatened.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.843
No sign of the security box
Jack tampered with.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.094

No sign of Jack here, either.

Well, my guess is he's going after
the target right now.

Let's search those other floors.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.936
You've seen the inventory.
Any idea what he's after?

left off in Morocco.

expected less.

Jack disabled the alarm so
he can pull off the theft.

Then he'll switch the wires back
before Mozzie walks in.

An Easter present from Alexander III
to his lovely wife Maria.

34:41.790 --> 34:44.126
Ah, a Fabergé egg.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.003
They're going for the egg.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.046
See? This is why you need me.

34:48.213 --> 34:50.966
Russian exhibit's on the fourth floor.
That's where Jack has to be.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.634
All right, go.
I got this.

35:20.329 --> 35:22.080
(ALARM RINGING)

35:24.917 --> 35:25.918
FBI!

35:28.837 --> 35:33.467
"Man is the only kind of varmint sets
his own trap, baits it, then steps in it."

35:33.592 --> 35:34.760
PETER: Steinbeck.

35:34.885 --> 35:37.179
Didn't he also say, "You have the right
to remain silent"?

35:37.804 --> 35:39.389
I think that was Sergeant Friday.

35:39.515 --> 35:41.600
Yup, I get those two mixed up.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.019
I want my lawyer.

35:44.436 --> 35:45.979
I haven't gotten to that part yet.

35:46.063 --> 35:49.066
Since you clearly don't need this,
let me take it off your hands.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.822
(HANDCUFFS CLICKING)

35:56.740 --> 35:58.325
Now to find his better half.

36:04.623 --> 36:06.542
(ALARM RINGING)

36:08.377 --> 36:09.378
We have to go.

36:09.461 --> 36:11.129
I'm guessing
this wasn't part of your plan.

36:13.382 --> 36:14.842
It's part of yours though, isn't it?

36:15.008 --> 36:19.429
It's safe to assume that by now
the FBI has Jack and the egg.

36:21.056 --> 36:23.141
How much...
How much time do I have?

36:23.559 --> 36:25.769
-Not enough.
-(PANTING)

36:26.979 --> 36:28.355
Well played.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.148
You were a worthy opponent.

36:30.315 --> 36:33.944
You found my weak spot.
You knew I would come if you called.

36:34.236 --> 36:36.655
Somewhere along the line I misjudged.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.449
This plan would've worked five years ago.

36:39.533 --> 36:44.121
Five years ago there would be
no Neal, no Suit for that matter.

36:44.204 --> 36:46.832
By myself, I would've walked
right into your trap.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.085
You're not working alone.

36:52.838 --> 36:54.339
I didn't see that coming.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.466
Five years ago I wouldn't either.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.970
-I'm sorry, Mozzie...
-No, no.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.805
You're not, Eva.

37:01.889 --> 37:05.184
You're conning me to help you escape.

37:07.436 --> 37:09.313
Doesn't mean I'm not sorry.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.866
I would've done it anyway.

37:21.033 --> 37:24.786
My plan includes a very
generous escape hatch.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.873
Unlike you, I live by a code.

37:28.207 --> 37:30.834
The alarms have heightened security.
There are guards at every door.

37:33.253 --> 37:35.756
What do you say about one last con?

37:36.924 --> 37:39.009
After all, they are playing our song.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.180
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

37:45.891 --> 37:48.352
We lost the eagle.
What the hell is Mozzie up to?

37:50.562 --> 37:52.648
-EVA: I'm sorry.
-Are you sure this is what you want?

37:52.731 --> 37:55.692
-After all we've shared?
-You know what we have shared?

37:55.776 --> 37:58.195
Nothing but lies and deception.

37:58.278 --> 38:01.448
We're securing this area.
You two can't do this here.

38:01.532 --> 38:04.326
You know what? You're right.
You are absolutely right.

38:04.409 --> 38:08.372
We can't do this anymore. We're always
trying to one-up and outsmart each other.

38:08.455 --> 38:10.374
And you're willing to throw that all away?

38:10.457 --> 38:13.085
You can't find what we have
with someone else.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.087
(CRYING) I know.

38:15.170 --> 38:17.256
That's why we have to say goodbye.

38:17.923 --> 38:20.926
You can't hold me here like a criminal.
I have rights.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.345
-What's going on?
-I have to use the bathroom.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.305
GUARD: I'm not authorized
to let anyone through.

38:25.389 --> 38:26.765
I feel like a caged animal.

38:29.226 --> 38:32.062
-(GASPS)
-That is still such a rush.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.775
I'd ask you to come with me, but...

38:36.859 --> 38:39.486
But you won't ask a question
you don't know the answer to.

38:59.590 --> 39:01.633
Where is she?
Where's Eva?

39:01.717 --> 39:03.385
I don't know.
She got away.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.554
The good ones always do.

39:07.306 --> 39:08.682
We have a suspect on the run.

39:08.765 --> 39:11.018
All units be on the lookout
for Eva Perkins.

39:11.643 --> 39:12.853
He'll never find her.

39:12.936 --> 39:15.522
Well, we got Jack and the egg.
He'll be okay.

39:16.565 --> 39:19.318
-How about you?
-Oh, I'm fine.

39:19.401 --> 39:21.528
I have my bees.

39:22.905 --> 39:24.823
Looks like you're a bachelor again.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.783
You ready to find a new
sweetheart to con?

39:29.453 --> 39:31.330
MOZZIE: Oh, nope. I can't.

39:32.915 --> 39:34.499
I'm taken.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.084
Okay.

39:41.673 --> 39:43.967
Let me guess, no sign of Eva?

39:44.051 --> 39:48.305
Forget Eva. I just got off the phone
with the ASAC in San Francisco.

39:49.431 --> 39:52.935
-The Panthers never showed up.
-What? What happened?

39:53.018 --> 39:55.395
No idea. Damn it!
We almost had them.

39:55.521 --> 39:57.147
Do we know what they were after?

39:57.439 --> 40:00.025
We ran a list of the passengers.
Nothing suspicious.

40:00.108 --> 40:03.487
Diplomats, bank CEOs, people
with access to valuable targets?

40:03.612 --> 40:05.447
-Nothing.
-What about cargo?

40:05.531 --> 40:06.782
We're being stonewalled.

40:07.115 --> 40:09.284
The airline won't confirm
or deny the presence

40:09.409 --> 40:10.953
of anything valuable on the plane.

40:11.036 --> 40:13.413
-Which means there was something.
-Exactly.

40:14.623 --> 40:17.876
Well, I just mobilized half the agents
in San Francisco for nothing,

40:17.960 --> 40:21.213
and now I've got a dozen people
above me demanding answers.

40:21.296 --> 40:24.049
There's something more going on with
the Panthers. Something we're missing.

40:24.258 --> 40:26.510
Well, we better find out
what that is, and soon,

40:26.802 --> 40:29.221
or else this whole thing is going
to blow up on both of us.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.483
-PETER: All right, what's up?
-We have good news.

40:41.859 --> 40:43.068
You know where the Panthers are?

40:43.151 --> 40:45.070
Would you settle for knowing
what they're going after?

40:45.362 --> 40:47.322
Based on Neal's missions
with the Panthers,

40:47.406 --> 40:50.158
we know the big score has something
to do with Braxnet Security.

40:50.409 --> 40:53.453
Because Neal stole the stamp
to clock their security response times.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.248
Right, and Atlas Tech, where he
took the Exodus file from.

40:56.415 --> 40:57.833
So whatever the Panthers are targeting,

40:57.916 --> 40:59.751
it's something these two
companies have in common.

41:00.002 --> 41:03.046
Turns out, both companies have
a long list of government contracts.

41:03.130 --> 41:05.841
When we cross-referenced
their client list, only one remained.

41:09.261 --> 41:11.054
The Panthers are going after the Fed.

41:11.180 --> 41:12.639
And the Fed only handles one thing.

41:13.515 --> 41:15.642
Cash. They're going after cash.

41:15.809 --> 41:18.937
And not just any cash. We know the flight
today was coming from Europe, right?

41:19.188 --> 41:22.774
When Americans travel to Europe, they
exchange American currency for Euros.

41:22.858 --> 41:24.693
That money's collected by
the Central Bank,

41:24.776 --> 41:26.195
then shipped back to the US.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.405
Where, according to the randomizer,
it could be delivered to

41:28.488 --> 41:30.240
any one of 12 airports.

41:30.324 --> 41:31.617
Any city with a Federal Reserve.

41:31.783 --> 41:33.702
I've heard of this.
It's completely classified.

41:33.785 --> 41:35.621
Not even the FBI is kept in the loop.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.122
That's why they use the randomizer.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.833
It ensures no one knows when or
where the money will be delivered

41:39.917 --> 41:41.210
until the day of the shipment.

41:41.293 --> 41:43.045
So where does Braxnet fit
into all of this?

41:44.171 --> 41:46.048
They provide security for the shipment.

41:46.340 --> 41:49.301
The money's held at airport warehouses
until the Fed picks it up

41:49.384 --> 41:50.928
and redistributes it.

41:51.220 --> 41:52.596
How much cash are we talking?

41:52.679 --> 41:56.183
Each shipment contains
as much as $500 million.

41:56.391 --> 41:59.686
And the icing on the cake,
the cash is clean.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.271
Completely untraceable.

42:01.939 --> 42:05.901
The Panthers are going after
half a billion dollars in unmarked cash.

42:14.993 --> 42:16.370
Woodford.

42:18.539 --> 42:20.207
Nice of you to drop by.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.252
Figured I'd return the favor.

42:24.711 --> 42:27.297
Not here to exchange pleasantries, I see.

42:28.966 --> 42:30.551
There's a small problem.

42:33.178 --> 42:35.430
It seems there's a mole in the operation.
