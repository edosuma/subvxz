00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.810
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.081
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.249
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.185
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.387
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.090
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:22.123 --> 00:24.258
We haven't had
a chance to spend
a lot of time together.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.127
You know? Just us.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.330
If it's okay with you,
I'd like to bring
an assistant with me.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.564
Hey. Where are you?
The bus is about to leave.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.200
Change of plans.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.468
What were you doing with
Beau Bronn anyway?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.104
He asked me to
come work for him.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.438
What's your problem
with Jane?

00:37.471 --> 00:40.441
The fact that my
boyfriend's life revolves
around another girl.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.376
I can't hear you.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.579
Jane, you are not having sex
with wrong guy tonight!

00:45.613 --> 00:47.081
All right, fellas.
Here's how it's going down.

00:47.115 --> 00:47.648
Are you robbing
this place, Tommy?

00:49.650 --> 00:51.285
Let's g(SIRENS WAILING)'s go.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.088
It's time to stop
lying to me, Jane.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.363
JANE: Fashion crimes.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.633
We've all
committed them.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.467
The things we wish
we hadn't worn.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.672
The things we wish
we hadn't done.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.675
But there's no use
looking back.

01:22.316 --> 01:26.520
Because sometimes
getting caught is the thing
that sets us free.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.263
* I've my heart where
my head should be

01:35.296 --> 01:38.599
* Light up the rest of me

01:38.632 --> 01:42.336
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

01:42.370 --> 01:44.272
* Through the stops,
the starts

01:44.305 --> 01:46.174
* And life is a work of art

01:52.213 --> 01:53.181
Ben.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.685
Ben, come on.
You're gonna have to
talk to me at some point.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.656
Just let me explain.

02:02.690 --> 02:06.294
Actually, I was up
all night trying to think
of an explanation

02:06.327 --> 02:08.296
that would somehow
fix the fact

02:08.329 --> 02:10.564
that you've been
going behind my back
for the past few months,

02:10.598 --> 02:12.933
and honestly, Jane,

02:12.966 --> 02:14.468
I'm coming up empty.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.940
I wasn't going
behind your back,
Ben, I just...

02:19.973 --> 02:21.475
You lied.
To me of all people.

02:21.509 --> 02:22.643
After all
we've been through?

02:22.676 --> 02:22.743
I thought we were
closer than that.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.716
I was trying to help.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.783
I mean, did you
seriously not notice

02:29.817 --> 02:31.452
the bank stopped calling
about the mortgage and...

02:31.485 --> 02:33.454
Wait. What?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.223
Nothing.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.593
You've been lying and
pretending to be an adult

02:39.627 --> 02:42.496
because of me?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.531
Because of us.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.499
The money.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.302
Great.

02:48.736 --> 02:49.169
Wow.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.973
That feels so much better.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.377
I went in for the internship,
so that I could help,

02:56.410 --> 02:58.579
and then I guess
they got
a little confused...

02:58.612 --> 03:03.284
And you never thought
it might be wise to
clear up their confusion?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.986
Well, if I had told them
it would've been over,

03:06.019 --> 03:08.389
and I couldn't risk that.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.759
And what's your excuse
for lying to me?

03:11.792 --> 03:13.761
What's the reason
behind that?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.531
I don't know.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.374
Ben, I love it.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.509
This job, it's...
It's my passion,

03:28.542 --> 03:33.013
and I can't imagine doing,
or being, anything else.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.615
And honestly,
I'd still go every day

03:34.648 --> 03:37.785
even if they weren't
paying me $34,000 a year.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.419
Are you kidding me?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.388
What?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.357
You're making more
than I am.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.793
Exactly,
which is why...

03:45.826 --> 03:47.395
It has to stop.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.598
No. No, Ben. Please.
I love this job so much
and...

03:50.631 --> 03:53.334
I know you love it.
And I love that
you love it.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.669
But Jane,
you're still a kid.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.438
It's done.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.706
This isn't fair.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.474
Fair? You're right.
It isn't.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.242
You know what else
it isn't? Legal.

she's not coming.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.309

is with this stuff.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.077
Actually, I don't.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.348
Let's just say she's...

04:40.381 --> 04:42.850
She's lost patience
with the whole
reckless youth thing.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.453
No. She lost patience
with you, Tommy.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.421
God! I knew
this was a bad idea.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.856
I told you I wanted out.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.758
So, this is my fault?

about an hour ago, and
she refused to come down.

for him to be released to you

Ben, I don't know
how Not now....

06:11.772 --> 06:14.141
You've all done
a tremendous job

06:14.174 --> 06:16.410
of bringing Donovan's
Marie-Antoinette
collection to life

06:16.444 --> 06:17.511
for Fashion Week,

06:17.545 --> 06:18.546
and I'm extremely
proud of it.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.948
And Donovan...

06:20.981 --> 06:23.417
Donovan's here?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.652
Donovan wanted to be here.

to get complacent.

We do not rest until
this collection is going down
the catwalk tomorrow night.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.826
Until then
we're all on lock down.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.961
No photos, no texting.
Nothing.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.564
Not with anyone.
Is that clear?

06:38.799 --> 06:39.733
Good.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.770
Where the hell
is Jane?

06:42.803 --> 06:45.573
Uh, I'm not exactly sure,
but Gray, listen...

06:45.606 --> 06:47.841
No. You listen.
We have a show
in 24 hours.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.843
And the collection
is perfect.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.678
But I need
all hands on deck.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.946
And you and I both know

06:52.980 --> 06:55.749
that someone on the inside
would like to see us fail.

going to let happen

on Donovan's work.

see that now.

how much trouble
you could be in?

from a school camping trip

not telling me?

So I called Tommy and he
picked me up from camping.

got outta control.

it was fine at first.

she started
asking me about you.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.261
Hey.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.096
See ya.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.999
So, how are you?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.267
Lulu, huh?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.971
It's not wNo? you think.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.206
'Cause Billy saw you.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.808
I can explain.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.944
Oh, he saw you together
to be more precise.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.814
Just give me a second
to explain myself.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.848
Okay.
Go ahead.

11:55.883 --> 11:56.917
Go.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.053
I didn't think so.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.422
You know what though?
I get it.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.225
The stars.
The campfire.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.095
It's all very romantic.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.897
I mean,
how could you resist?

12:09.930 --> 12:16.169
I'm really, really glad
I didn't stick around
for that.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.806
Hey. You not sticking around
is what got us here
in the first place, Jane.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.307
Got us where?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.042
You can't put this
all on me.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.277
That's completely unfair.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.113
I was looking forward
to being with you.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.782
Well, you've got
a funny way of showing it.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.784
And what about you?
How's wrong guy?

12:30.818 --> 12:33.787
What're you
talking about?

12:33.821 --> 12:35.322
You said you couldn't
come to the camp
because you had to work.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.124
I did have to work.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.158
No, you didn't.

12:38.191 --> 12:42.162
Yeah, I did.
I called because I
wanted to...

12:42.195 --> 12:44.531
I don't know.
I wanted to hear your voice
or something,

12:44.564 --> 12:48.001
which is idiotic.
I realize that.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.803
You wanna know
what's idiotic?

12:49.837 --> 12:52.339
You sticking your tongue
down Lulu's throat.
That's what.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.941
And what were
you doing, Jane?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.276
Nothing!

12:56.309 --> 12:57.110
Sure sounded like
something when that girl
answered your phone.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.280
I could barely
hear her

13:00.313 --> 13:02.349
over all the music
blasting at your
work function.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.318
But what I did hear
was her yelling at you
and wrong guy.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.288
What? So you just hung
up the phone and then marched
over to Lulu's tent, and...

13:08.321 --> 13:09.857
What was I
supposed to think?

13:09.890 --> 13:13.026
You didn't even give me
a chance to explain.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.165
I don't know
what else to say.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.799
Jane, jDon't.t me...

13:21.168 --> 13:22.102
Okay? I can't.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.204
I can't talk to you.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.206
Not anymore.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.081
Oh, and for the record,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.416
absolutely nothing happened
with wrong guy.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.020
I was too busy
talking about you.

13:57.905 --> 13:58.538
Do you think
he got a tattoo?

13:58.571 --> 13:59.306
Or maybe
he joined a gang?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.876
What're you talking about?

14:02.910 --> 14:05.078
Billy.
He left camping early and

14:05.112 --> 14:07.915
went on some crazy
crime spree.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.417
I wonder what it takes
to make a person do
something like that.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.252
I wouldn't know.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.287
People change in there.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.323
Can we just drop it, Harper?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.225
The entire school
is talking about it.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.893
Cam even heard
he got shanked.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.295
Do you even know
what that means?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.931
Of course I do.
I watch The Wire.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.338
(BELL RINGING)

14:33.706 --> 14:35.275
All right, everybody.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.346
Let's get down to

14:44.051 --> 14:45.085
business.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.187
What's in the briefcase?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.156
I'm glad you asked, Harper.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.660
As we embark today
on the business
of sexual education,

14:53.693 --> 14:58.898
I would like to
introduce you to
today's guest lecturers.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.668
Responsible Ricky.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.003
And Abstinent Alice.

15:03.036 --> 15:10.410
Now, Ricky and Alice
have decided to go
for a drive together.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.411
It should be noted that
they have waited

15:11.444 --> 15:16.950
a very, very, very long time

15:16.984 --> 15:18.051
until they've decided
to let Ricky
get behind the wheel.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.490
Can anyone tell me
that Ricky,
being responsible,

15:23.523 --> 15:25.425
what the first thing
he puts on

15:25.458 --> 15:27.394
when he gets into
the car with Alice is?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.430
A condom.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.967
I was gonna
say seatbelt.
But...

15:34.001 --> 15:35.435
BEN: So, Ricky puts on
his seatbelt...

15:35.468 --> 15:39.239
Look, man.
I'm really sorry.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.110
I screwed up.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.377
You're my friend,
and there's no excuse
for what I did.

15:46.746 --> 15:47.580
Dude.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.384
Look, I just want to
make it up to you.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.386
To Jane.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.089
It was a mistake.
Three things.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.257
First.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.526
You can't
make it up to me.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.328
Second.
We're not friends.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.463
Never were,
never will be.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.433
And third,
most important of all,
is Jane.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.369
I warned you.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.570
I warned you
not to hurt her.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.075
BEN: ...they're driving
the sports car

16:15.108 --> 16:15.442
into the longest

16:17.277 --> 16:20.280
minivan drive

16:20.313 --> 16:21.414
of their lives.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.019
What's up, Billy?

16:26.053 --> 16:28.155
I think I need to
step outside before I
do something I regret.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.526
I think that's
probably a good idea.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.435
I got to be honest, Jane.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.405
I'm nervous about
this court thing today.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.574
It's gonna work out.
It's all gonna be fine.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.578
People always say that,
but what if it's not?

16:51.611 --> 16:54.047
It's very possible
that I could be...

16:55.115 --> 16:56.383
Not fine.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.318
You will.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.587
Because if you're not,
I won't be.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.393
Look, we're gonna be there.
Every minute. Me and Ben.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.128
He said he has to
do something beforehand
though,

17:08.161 --> 17:10.130
so he's just gonna
meet us there, okay?

17:10.163 --> 17:10.830
Okay.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.098
(SIGHS)

17:14.401 --> 17:15.468
So...

17:15.502 --> 17:18.505
Are you gonna
wear this to court?

17:20.307 --> 17:22.409
What else would I wear?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.811
I don't know.
I mean...

17:24.844 --> 17:29.116
Look. Don't get me wrong,
I totally hated that guy,
but...

17:29.149 --> 17:31.451
This might be
a really good time for
preppy, douchey Billy

17:31.484 --> 17:33.086
to make an appearance.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.187
(CHUCKLES)

17:34.221 --> 17:36.289
Just a suggestion.

17:36.323 --> 17:40.327
Thanks, but,
I think I'll stick
with this, Janey.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.230
This is me.

It's Gray.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.644
What?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.146
You have to go.

17:59.179 --> 17:59.446
And leave you?
No way.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.416
I'm going to that
court date and I'm...

18:03.450 --> 18:05.385
No.
No, you're not.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.354
(SIGHS)
Billy, I...

18:07.387 --> 18:09.556
You said
if you didn't show up,
you were done.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.892
You're going
to that fashion show.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.594
End of discussion.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.662
What about Ben?

18:15.695 --> 18:17.397
I'll take care
of Ben, okay?

18:17.430 --> 18:19.566
I'll talk to him.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.301
Just go already.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.435
Go!

18:31.178 --> 18:32.212
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

18:34.281 --> 18:37.317
Yeah?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.686
I just came by to make sure
somebody was gonna be in court
for Billy's hearing.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.454
It's in about an hour.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.456
I would, really,

18:45.292 --> 18:48.528
but I gotta catch up
on a couple of things.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.198
It's amazing how
far behind you get

18:51.231 --> 18:51.498
when you're away
for a couple of days.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.170
Look, I've got
my own court date
to worry about, okay?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.306
Fine.
What about your mom?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.442
Your guess is
as good as mine.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.478
What the hell's
the matter with you,
Tommy?

19:05.512 --> 19:06.479
Beg your pardon?

19:06.513 --> 19:08.348
It's your fault
that he's in
this situation,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.483
and you're not even
gonna be there for him?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.719
You need to
go tell the judge
what really happened.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.253
That's not good
for my defense.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.622
What's your defense?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.324
Falsely accused.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.426
Are you being serious?

19:19.459 --> 19:22.195
The kid's tough.
He's smart.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.597
He doesn't need me,
he doesn't need you,

19:24.631 --> 19:25.965
and he certainly doesn't
need to be coddled.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.201
No. You know
what he needs?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.403
He needs a brother.

If you don't mind, Gray,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.413
I'd love if we could touch
a little bit on your rivalry
with Beau Bronn.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.749
GRAY: Of course.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.552
I have the greatest
admiration for Beau.
He's...

19:46.753 --> 19:49.256
An incredible talent.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.658
I was fortunate enough to
get a sneak peek of
his collection this morning,

19:51.691 --> 19:54.327
and I have to say,
a modern take
on Marie-Antoinette?

19:54.361 --> 19:55.595
It's brilliant.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.396
You must be joking.
That's...

19:56.429 --> 19:59.466
That's inspired.

Oh. I think...

20:20.487 --> 20:24.524
I think this was
a little overwhelming
for her. So...

20:24.557 --> 20:27.427
She got super emotional
so I just told her to

20:27.460 --> 20:29.396
stay back at the house.

for the better.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.302
I must say, Mr. Nutter,
I'm sorry to see you.

What do you have to
say for yourself, son?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.607
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:15.442 --> 21:16.609
Just that, uh...

21:18.511 --> 21:20.713
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.749
I, uh...

21:22.782 --> 21:24.717
I made a bad decision, sir.
I know that.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.053
And I'm...

21:27.086 --> 21:27.354
I'm sorry.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.758
It says here
you didn't act
on your own accord.

21:31.791 --> 21:36.763
That you were coerced into
committing said acts by
older brother Thomas Nutter.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.531
Is that correct?

21:41.534 --> 21:41.834
No, Your Honor.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.604
No?

21:44.637 --> 21:45.872
Billy.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.306
I acted on my own.

21:48.741 --> 21:52.712
I'm going to ask you
one more time, Mr. Nutter,

21:52.745 --> 21:54.747
and I would recommend
that you think carefully
before you answer.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.852
Were you coerced
into aiding your brother

21:59.886 --> 22:02.422
with the acts for which
you're charged here today?

22:08.561 --> 22:09.896
I made my own
decisions, sir.

22:12.632 --> 22:13.666
Okay.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.769
Who posted bail
for this young man?

22:17.504 --> 22:18.605
I did.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.672

22:19.706 --> 22:22.909
I'm Ben Quimby, sir.

I just want to say
Billy is one of
my finest students

and a very close
friend of the family.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.683
I know him
extremely well.

22:32.685 --> 22:36.689

Between you and me,
if I see this kid coming
towards me on the sidewalk,

22:44.931 --> 22:46.766
I'm crossing.

no crosswalk.

But that's because
I don't know him

22:57.444 --> 22:59.378
as a person.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.882
In here.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.952
I'm just judging
by what I see.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.588
And lest we
not forget,

23:08.921 --> 23:11.624
this is what
really matters.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.827
Am I right?

23:14.861 --> 23:16.796
Back me up here.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.665
It might be true,
Mr. Quimby,

23:18.698 --> 23:24.203
but I see good kids
make mistakes in here
all the time.

23:24.236 --> 23:29.509
And that's why I think
a couple months at
New Hall Youth Detention

23:29.542 --> 23:31.578
might give Mr. Nutter
ample time to think
about those mistakes

23:31.611 --> 23:35.214
and their implications.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.784
Your Honor,
this is my client's
first offense.

23:37.817 --> 23:38.718
BEN: It's his first offense,
Your Honor...

23:38.751 --> 23:39.819
Just let me.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.989
And surely,
this isolated incident,
Your Honor,

23:43.022 --> 23:47.226
it should have no bearing
on his character.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.730
POPE: I'll need time
to review the case and
make my final decision.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.932
Until then
you stay out of trouble,
Mr. Nutter.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.203
This situation is
worse than tragic.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.838
It's pathetic.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.807
Beau strikes again.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.909
And, if we can't
turn it around
before tonight,

24:02.942 --> 24:04.611
we're all done for here.

24:04.644 --> 24:05.745
You understand?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.514
Gray, we go on
in four hours and...

24:09.549 --> 24:12.018
(STUTTERS)
Yeah. I understand.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.252
Well, I don't.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.488
Jane...

24:15.522 --> 24:17.890
How're we supposed to
re-do an entire collection
in four hours?

24:17.924 --> 24:18.691
It's impossible.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.627
We're dead in the water.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.028
GRAY: How did this happen?

24:22.061 --> 24:24.897
I was meticulous.
Vigilant.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.568
There was not a trace
of that collection outside
of the Lookbook,

24:28.601 --> 24:31.504
and that book was
never out of Jane's sight

24:31.538 --> 24:34.240
until she handed it
to me in Paris.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.042
Is that right, Jane?

24:36.075 --> 24:36.909
The Lookbook never
left your sight?

24:38.611 --> 24:39.812
Not once?
All day?

24:41.781 --> 24:44.751
Not technically.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.786
Technically?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.555
Well, I may have
misplaced it.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.656
Misplaced it?

24:49.689 --> 24:50.823
But only for a few hours.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.928
How could you not give me
that little bit
of information, Jane,

24:55.962 --> 24:58.030
when you handed me
the Lookbook in Paris?

24:58.064 --> 25:01.033
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.735
I knew it.

25:02.769 --> 25:03.870
You knew what?

25:03.903 --> 25:04.937
It was Jane.

25:04.971 --> 25:05.805
This is a total disaster.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.940
Not helping, Carter.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.742
Maybe India is right.
Maybe...

25:09.776 --> 25:10.843
Thank you.

25:10.877 --> 25:14.747
At least someone can see
what's really going on here.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.048
JEREMY:
Are you implying
that I can't?

25:16.082 --> 25:17.684
'Cause that's completely
uncalled for.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.852
What?
I don'tEnough!tand...

25:19.886 --> 25:22.088
We have plenty of time
to spread the blame,

25:22.121 --> 25:25.558
but only a few hours
before those girls
go down the runway.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.959
And we can
spend it bickering,

25:26.993 --> 25:28.761
or we can
spend it working.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.766
Jane! We're back.

25:34.601 --> 25:34.867
Janey?

25:38.605 --> 25:40.607
Where's she?

25:40.640 --> 25:43.042
Wow. That's so weird.
I mean, I totally thought
she was here.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.681
Sit down.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.887
She went anyway.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.689
She didn't quit,
did she?

25:56.723 --> 25:57.890
She lied. Again.

25:57.924 --> 26:01.027
Ben, tonight was huge
for her. Okay?

26:01.060 --> 26:01.961
You're being
It'serious right now?...

26:01.994 --> 26:04.030
She had to go.
I'm sorry.

26:04.063 --> 26:07.133
Come on, man.
I just stood up for you
in court.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.001
I just vouched for you.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.569
Look, she'll
only be there...

26:11.804 --> 26:15.574
This is what happens,
Billy, when you're nice
to people.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.009
Ben...

26:17.910 --> 26:19.879
Where are you going?

26:19.912 --> 26:21.180
I'm going to get Jane.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.656
GRAY: Okay.
We have no time.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.357
We cannot waste it.
We've got to do something.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.661
We go Latin.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.062
Infuse the collection
with fire.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.966
Show the complete visual
opposite of Threads.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.367
I like it.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.669
Not bad.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.906
We don't have to
completely re-invent
the whole collection.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.708
We just need to
re-imagine it.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.643
Use what we've got.
We only have...

26:50.677 --> 26:52.044
Two hours and change.

26:52.078 --> 26:55.181
I don't know.
India said we should
do something

26:55.214 --> 26:57.183
that visually
opposes Threads, right?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.852
GRAY: Right.

26:59.886 --> 27:03.890
Well, what if we take
the collection and
turn it on its ear?

27:03.923 --> 27:04.791
Now's really not the time
to be JEREMY: Ooh.gs...

27:06.225 --> 27:07.960
Go on, Jane.

27:07.994 --> 27:11.664
I have this friend,
my best friend actually,

27:11.698 --> 27:15.001
and he's had
his ups and downs and
he's questioned himself,

27:15.034 --> 27:17.670
but at the end of the day,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.672
he's who he is.
No matter what.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.107
So sweet.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.075
What's your point?

27:23.109 --> 27:25.011
Yes, Jane.
What're you suggesting?

27:25.044 --> 27:29.215
I'm suggesting that we
take our Marie-Antoinette
inspiration

27:29.248 --> 27:31.217
and we add a little
Sid Vicious to it.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.920
A total mash-up.

27:33.953 --> 27:34.987
I say

27:35.988 --> 27:36.989
we take it punk.

(DIALING PHONE)

28:17.897 --> 28:18.798
Come on, Janey.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.236
So, where were you
yesterday?

28:24.270 --> 28:27.206
I was...

28:27.239 --> 28:28.741
It was personal.

28:28.975 --> 28:31.911
Although,
according to Gray,

28:31.944 --> 28:35.848
we are not allowed
to have a personal life
around here.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.516
Which is probably
for the best.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.286
Considering I'm not
doing very well
in that department lately.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.888
Guy problems?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.290
Uh, you could say that.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.157
Do you need me
to beat a bad boy up
for you, Jane Quimby?

28:45.191 --> 28:49.028
Because I will.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.930
Just tell me
where he lives and
he's history.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.300
I'm stronger
than I look, you know?

28:54.333 --> 28:55.501
I spent a fair amount of
time on the streets
back in my day.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.037
(CHUCKLES)

28:58.070 --> 28:59.205

or after Parsons?

29:01.941 --> 29:04.911
Design school is a very
dark and dangerous place.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.813
Seriously though.
What happened?

29:06.846 --> 29:08.781
I thought he was
this great guy.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.818
I thought he was "It."

29:11.851 --> 29:13.052
Turns out he wasn't
who I thought he was.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.955
I'm sorry to hear that.

Oh, come on.
Tell me.

what they seem
at first glance.

I'm dying to hear this.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.179

you might think

29:40.212 --> 29:43.315
I'm a very successful,
handsome guy...

29:43.349 --> 29:46.953
So handsome.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.822

"Well, he's a flirt.
He's a playboy."

like that?"

looked a little deeper,
do you know what you'd see?

to get to know you better.

Oh, my God.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.188
What?

30:29.361 --> 30:31.330
You took my
wedding dress sketch.

30:31.363 --> 30:32.431
And I apologized.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.936
It was a cab driver, Jane.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.170
Was it?
I mean, I didn't see
a cab driver.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.340

with Beau in L.A.

our designs to Beau.

had whatever you had,
but I'm telling you,

31:29.355 --> 31:30.022
it was her.

Yes.

in an hour.

out of the blue,
out of thin air.

she hasn't studied anywhere.

until you hired her.

trying to say?

That it's obvious
Jane is the mole.

that's obvious to me

what I'm about to do.

respect and affection
for you,

have to say goodbye.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.194
Just wanted to swing by.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.696
Great. Thanks.
Thanks for swinging by.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.199
Look, I'll get out of your
hair in a minute, okay?

35:37.203 --> 35:39.205
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.139
You're not
like me, Bilbo.
You're a good kid.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.710
And...

35:44.743 --> 35:46.378
You deserve better
from a big brother.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.549
Why are you saying this?

35:51.617 --> 35:56.255
Well, 'cause,
you probably won't be
seeing me for a while.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.557
Third time's a charm,
if you know what I mean.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.226
No, it's fine.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.195
It's fine.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.197
I just...

36:05.231 --> 36:07.433
I needed to get that
off my chest before
I go away.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.236
And you should
do the same.

36:14.373 --> 36:15.607
So, where is she?

36:15.641 --> 36:16.375
Jane.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.377
Oh, she's...

36:18.510 --> 36:20.679
She's not here. Why?

36:23.515 --> 36:24.683
In case tomorrow
doesn't go the way
you're hoping,

36:27.453 --> 36:28.554
you should tell her.

36:30.722 --> 36:31.990
Tell her what?

36:32.023 --> 36:33.659
Tell her that
you love her.

36:35.461 --> 36:37.195
Jane's my
best friend, Tommy.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.766
I know I might not be
the best older brother,

36:40.799 --> 36:42.368
but even I could see it.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.604
Ever since
you were this big.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.573
It's always been Jane.

36:52.010 --> 36:52.678
I have to go.

37:02.020 --> 37:02.688
I know you do.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.428
Thank you.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.271
MALE PHOTOGRAPHER:
Yeah, and big smile.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.406

37:20.439 --> 37:23.475
FEMALE PHOTOGRAPHER:
Great!
Oh, you look fabulous.

37:23.509 --> 37:24.743
Right over here.
Thank you.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.815
Looks like
you're a hit as well.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.683
What can I say?

37:31.717 --> 37:33.552
We pulled out of a nose dive
and gave them a show.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.288
A great show.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.188
CARTER: Indeed.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.294
Um, would you just
excuse me for a minute?

37:42.328 --> 37:44.630
Just one minute.
I'm gonna just...

37:44.663 --> 37:46.732
I'll be right back.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.807
You don't even
have to say it.

37:55.841 --> 37:57.409
I'm sorry I lied.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.746
And I'm sorry I
left without telling
you today.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.583
I'm sorry, Ben.
About everything.

38:05.351 --> 38:09.321
But I had to finish
what I started here.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.357
This night.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.725
I just needed to do it.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.494
Hello.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.829
Hello.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.831
Gray Chandler Murray.
Jane's boss.

38:19.865 --> 38:23.068
I'm Ben. Ben Quimby.
Jane's brother.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.437
Oh. Jane never
mentioned a brother.

38:25.471 --> 38:29.107
There's a lot that
Jane doesn't mention.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.776
So, what did you think
of our show?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.412
I thought...

38:36.615 --> 38:38.450
It was incredible.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.586
Well, we couldn't have
done it without Jane.

38:40.619 --> 38:40.652
Is that right?

38:42.821 --> 38:46.892
Yes. She's has a bright
future ahead of her.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.660
Nice to meet you, Ben.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.863

He's so cute.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.401
(CHUCKLING)

39:04.610 --> 39:04.943
I let my dream go.

39:07.746 --> 39:10.449
And I.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.650
have never
regretted it.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.919
Never. Not at all.
Not even...

39:13.952 --> 39:16.388
Not even for a minute.

39:16.422 --> 39:16.855
Because I did it
so that

39:21.460 --> 39:22.961
you wouldn't have to
give up on yours.

39:25.731 --> 39:26.898
And this...

39:31.803 --> 39:33.439
This is definitely
your dream.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.777
But you can't lie to me.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.814
If I'm gonna
let this go on,

39:42.848 --> 39:45.451
you got to be up front
with me from now on.
Okay?

39:45.484 --> 39:46.452
Okay.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.556
Stop crying,
'cause you're gonna
make me cry,

39:50.589 --> 39:52.424
and I can't cry
at a fashion show.

39:52.458 --> 39:52.924
(LAUGHING)

39:56.995 --> 39:58.430
I love you, Ben.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.598
I love you
so much more.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.980
You want a ride home?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.215
Actually

40:17.248 --> 40:19.785
I was thinking about
hanging out here
for a little while.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.222
Yeah.
Just long as you're
back by midnight.

40:24.255 --> 40:24.990
I'm kidding.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.462
Ben?

40:31.797 --> 40:31.897
Thank you.

40:34.733 --> 40:35.767
For all of it.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.472
I'll...

40:40.506 --> 40:41.740
I'll see you at home.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.552
BILLY:
Come on, let's go.

40:53.585 --> 40:54.986
Let's go.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.624
Come on. Come on.

Heartbroken in Hoboken
on the line.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.728
What've you got to
say, Heartbroken?

41:02.761 --> 41:05.564
GIRL:
I told the guy I love
how I felt.

41:05.597 --> 41:08.266
He didn't feel the same

41:08.299 --> 41:09.768
I can't do this.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.506
No. I can do this.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.941
I can do this.
I can.

no, no, no.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.518
No! You gotta be
kidding me.

41:26.552 --> 41:27.753
Stop.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.788
Come on, baby.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.089
You don't want
to do this.
Not now.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.001
Hey, I...

41:43.034 --> 41:45.804
I thought
you already left?

41:45.837 --> 41:46.004
I did.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.808
But, I forgot something.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.813
I forgot to
say thank you.
To you.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.717
Before you came along,
I'd lost my love for this.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.989
But seeing it
through your eyes,

42:04.022 --> 42:05.724
it's made me love it
all over again.

42:06.825 --> 42:08.960

It'll just take a minute.
Just wait here, okay?

Wait.
What happened
in court today?

43:28.707 --> 43:30.942
I'll be fine. I just...

43:33.411 --> 43:35.080
I need to tell you
something, Janey.

43:36.815 --> 43:37.983
I can't do this anymore.

43:41.687 --> 43:42.754
Is that so?

43:43.755 --> 43:45.857
Yeah, it is.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.060
I'm done.

I really have no idea
how to say this.

So I'm just
gonna say it.
