10:15.467 --> 10:16.600
HOW I WAS GOING
TO REPLACE YOU.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.600
COME ON, MR. FEENY.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.100
I'M THE ONLY GAME
IN TOWN.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.800
THEN, MR. MATTHEWS,
THERE IS NO GAME.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.400
UH, MR. FEENY.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
I NOTICED YOU'VE
LEFT THE CLASSROOM

10:33.400 --> 10:35.133
AND TURNED EAST.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.200
TOWARDS EUROPE,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.667
COME ON,
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.934
A CHANCE TO WHAT,
MR. MATTHEWS?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.934
TO PUBLICLY HUMILIATE ME?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.700
NO. TO WIN FOR YOU.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.700
YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN
ANY INTEREST

10:47.700 --> 10:49.000
IN GEOGRAPHY BEFORE THIS.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.300
BUT I DO HAVE
AN INTEREST

10:50.300 --> 10:52.667
IN WINNING THE
GEOGRAPHY TOURNAMENT.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.567
I CAN LEARN ANYTHING
WHEN I'M INTERESTED IN IT.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.967
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU'RE WILLING

10:56.967 --> 10:58.467
TO LEARN SOMETHING
FROM ME?

10:58.467 --> 11:00.200
YEAH.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.934
AND IF ANYONE CAN
TEACH ME, YOU CAN.

11:02.934 --> 11:05.300
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND
OF TEACHER YOU ARE.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.667
I'M AN EMPTY VESSEL.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.400
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I
HEARD YOU SAY THAT?

11:12.100 --> 11:13.967
I'VE LOST COUNT.

11:13.967 --> 11:16.300
BUT I'M WILLING
TO LEARN FROM YOU.

11:16.300 --> 11:20.000
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.800
WELL...I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE EVER HEARD THOSE WORDS

11:23.800 --> 11:25.567
IN THAT ORDER
FROM YOU.

11:27.967 --> 11:32.500
ALL RIGHT, MR. MATTHEWS.
I WILL TAKE YOU ON.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.200
I SHALL PREP YOU
FOR THE TOURNAMENT.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.233
I KNOW THAT YOUR
MOTIVES ARE NOT PURE,

11:37.233 --> 11:39.700
BUT I HOPE YOUR
QUEST FOR THE PRIZE

11:39.700 --> 11:42.100
WILL LEAD YOU TO THE
TEMPLE OF KNOWLEDGE.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.500
YEAH, YEAH.
IF IT'S ON THE WAY.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.400
MM-HMM.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.300
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO THE PARK?

11:56.300 --> 11:58.367
COME ON, MAN, YOU'RE
STUDYING TOO MUCH.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.100
THE TEACHERS ARE
STARTING TO NOTICE.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.900
YEAH, THEY'RE CALLING
YOU A GOOD STUDENT.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.200
THEY'RE SAYING
YOU HAVE POTENTIAL.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.700
WOW! THE HIGHEST
AND LOWEST POINTS

12:07.700 --> 12:09.834
IN THE CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES

12:09.834 --> 12:11.867
ARE ONLY 50 MILES APART,

12:11.867 --> 12:14.000
DEATH VALLEY
AND MOUNT WHITNEY.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.967
I FIND THAT EXTRAORDINARY.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.100
EXTRAORDINARY?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.900
HE'S MUTATING, MAN.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.567
OW.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.734
HEY, DUDES.
WHAT'S UP?

12:34.100 --> 12:35.834
TOO WEIRD FOR ME.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.133
I'M OUT OF HERE.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.000
HEY, MY BUDS
INVITED ME DOWN

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
TO THE SEWER PIPES
TO BREAK BOTTLES.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
WANT TO COME?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.767
MINKUS, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.000
I NEED TO USE
YOUR BRAIN.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.400
SORRY, MY BRAIN
IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.734
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THIS BAT BOY GIG.

12:50.734 --> 12:52.834
IN THE OLD DAYS, THINGS
USED TO BE SO SIMPLE.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.600
YOU HAD RUSSIA,
YOU HAD MOSCOW--

12:54.600 --> 12:55.967
ONE COUNTRY, ONE CAPITAL.

12:55.967 --> 12:59.767
NOW YOU'VE GOT YOUR LATVIA,
YOUR ESTONIA, YOUR UKRAINE,

12:59.767 --> 13:02.767
AND EACH ONE HAS
ITS OWN SEPARATE CAPITAL.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.100
WHAT WERE
THESE PEOPLE THINKING?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.400
HELP ME, MINKUS.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.967
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, DUDE.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.100
EVERY TIME
I THINK I'M OUT,

13:11.100 --> 13:13.200
THEY TRY TO <i>SUCK </i>ME BACK IN.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.100
YOU SEEM TO BE HOLDING
YOUR OWN QUITE NICELY.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.600
THANKS.
LAST NIGHT I WATCHED
<i>HOUSE OF STYLE </i>ON MTV.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.867
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:22.867 --> 13:26.867
I THINK WESTERN CIVILIZATION
IS IN ITS DECLINE.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.867
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.300
I'M GOING TO WATCH
<i>BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD </i>NOW.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.233
SO, MR. MATTHEWS,
HOW GOES THE STUDYING?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.400
GREAT. YOU KNOW,
I'M REALLY GETTING INTO IT.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.100
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
MAKE AN ADMIRABLE BAT BOY.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.467
I HOPE SO,

13:45.467 --> 13:48.934
BUT LEARNING ALL THIS STUFF
IS PRETTY FUN, TOO.

13:48.934 --> 13:50.300
DID YOU KNOW THAT HAWAII

13:50.300 --> 13:52.200
USED TO BE CALLED
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS?

13:52.200 --> 13:55.600
REALLY?
THAT'S FASCINATING.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.967
WE'RE THEY NAMED
AFTER SOMEBODY?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.400
YES, THE EARL OF SANDWICH.

14:00.400 --> 14:04.367
SANDWICH?
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE--

14:04.367 --> 14:07.600
YES, HE DID INVENT
THE SANDWICH.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.233
ISN'T THAT WEIRD?

14:12.133 --> 14:13.934
WEIRD, INDEED,
MR. MATTHEWS.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.100
THE BUCKEYE STATE?
OHIO.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.734
THE BLUEGRASS STATE?
KENTUCKY.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.934
HIGHEST MOUNTAIN
IN AFRICA?
KILIMANJARO.

14:22.934 --> 14:24.400
ELTON JOHN.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.834
OURS.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.200
LED ZEPPELIN.
OH, PLEASE.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.567
TINA TURNER.
MY MOTHER'S.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.700
ERIC, IF IT
BOTHERS YOU SO MUCH

14:32.700 --> 14:34.467
THAT YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE GOING TO THIS CONCERT,

14:34.467 --> 14:37.400
WHY DON'T YOU REBEL--
DON'T GO.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.600
OH, YEAH. I SEE
YOUR GAME HERE.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.567
YOU'D LOVE IT IF I DIDN'T
GO TO THAT CONCERT,

14:42.567 --> 14:44.300
WOULDN'T YOU?
NICE TRY, DAD.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.667
HEATHER AND I ARE GOING
TO THAT CONCERT.

14:46.667 --> 14:49.100
WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE
64 ROWS BEHIND YOU,

14:49.100 --> 14:50.500
BREATHING
DOWN YOUR NECK.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.967
ARE YOUR SHOULDERS
TENSE, MR. MATTHEWS?

15:05.834 --> 15:07.867
YEAH, THEY'RE
A LITTLE TENSE.

15:07.867 --> 15:10.300
THEN I SUGGEST
YOU GO LIKE THIS...

15:13.033 --> 15:15.100
YOU SHOULD REALLY RELAX,
MR. FEENY.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.467
I GOT A GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

15:17.467 --> 15:18.834
YOUR TROPHY'S IN THE BAG,

15:18.834 --> 15:22.033
AND I'M GONNA BE HANDING OUT
BATS AT THE FALL CLASSIC.

15:22.033 --> 15:24.100
HERE YOU ARE, MR. BONDS.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.667
PINCH HIT FOR YOU?

15:25.667 --> 15:29.200
WHY, IT'D BE <i>MY </i>PLEASURE.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.000
<i>Moderator: </i>
<i>CONTESTANT 3, </i>

15:32.000 --> 15:35.834
<i>NAME THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES </i>
<i>OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO. </i>

15:35.834 --> 15:37.200
WHO ARE THE YAHGANS?

15:37.200 --> 15:39.900
<i>IT IS UNNECESSARY </i>
<i>TO PHRASE YOUR ANSWER </i>

15:39.900 --> 15:41.934
<i>IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION. </i>

15:41.934 --> 15:43.367
SORRY.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.734
<i>CONTESTANT 4, WHAT </i>
<i>IS THE PRIMARY EXPORT </i>

15:46.734 --> 15:47.867
<i>OF THE TUAMOTUS? </i>

15:47.867 --> 15:51.133
ARE THESE GUYS WORKING
FROM A DIFFERENT GLOBE?

15:51.133 --> 15:54.400
I BELIEVE THAT
WOULD BE COPRA.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.767
<i>THANK YOU. </i>

15:55.767 --> 15:59.600
<i>AND CONTESTANT 5, </i>
<i>TO WHOM DO THEY BELONG? </i>

15:59.600 --> 16:02.100
TO WHOM DOES WHO BELONG?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.367
<i>THE TUAMOTUS. </i>

16:03.367 --> 16:07.900
<i>OF WHAT COUNTRY ARE </i>
<i>THEY A POSSESSION? </i>

16:07.900 --> 16:09.000
DID YOU KNOW THAT HAWAII

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
USED TO BE CALLED
THE SANDWICH ISLANDS,

16:11.000 --> 16:12.500
WHICH WERE NAMED AFTER
THE EARL OF SANDWICH

16:12.500 --> 16:14.400
WHO DISCOVERED
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY?

16:14.400 --> 16:18.000
<i>I'M SORRY. </i>
<i>THE ANSWER IS FRANCE. </i>

16:18.000 --> 16:22.467
OH, SURE. SHE GETS
A NO BRAINER--"COPRA."

16:22.467 --> 16:26.934
FLORIDA IS THE SOUTHERNMOST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

16:26.934 --> 16:31.600
ALASKA IS THE NORTHERNMOST
OF THE UNITED STATES.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.500
PUERTO RICO IS STILL
A TERRITORY,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.500
SO IS GUAM.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.667
WHAT DOES A BAT BOY DO?

16:38.667 --> 16:40.033
I DON'T KNOW.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.033
THEY HAND PLAYERS BATS.
GET IT, BAT BOY?

16:43.033 --> 16:45.000
WELL, WHO WOULD
WANT TO DO THAT?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.367
YEAH. WHAT
A STUPID PRIZE.

16:47.367 --> 16:48.567
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO

16:48.567 --> 16:50.800
THE MERCATOR PROJECTION
PULL-DOWN WALL MAP?

16:54.467 --> 16:55.767
OH...

16:55.767 --> 16:57.867
I'M HITTING MY HEAD.

16:57.867 --> 17:00.834
I'M HITTING THE
NORTHERNMOST PART OF MY HEAD.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.000
SO I TRY NOT TO LOOK
DOWN AT ROW C-C

17:08.000 --> 17:10.800
BECAUSE HEATHER AND I ARE
HAVING A GOOD TIME, YOU KNOW?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.367
BUT I CAN'T HELP LOOKING.

17:12.367 --> 17:14.500
ARE MOM AND DAD
SITTING IN ROW C-C?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.700
NO, MOM AND DAD ARE
DANCING IN THE AISLES.

17:17.700 --> 17:20.000
COME ON, ERIC, I THINK YOUR
PARENTS ARE REALLY COOL.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.734
OH, GOOD, I'M THE LUCKY BOY
WITH THE COOL PARENTS.

17:22.734 --> 17:25.000
YOUR MOM WAS SITTING
ON YOUR DAD'S SHOULDERS.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.200
IT WAS ADORABLE.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.467
I DON'T WANT
ADORABLE PARENTS.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.300
CORY, YOU WANT
ADORABLE PARENTS?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.834
NOPE. I JUST WANT THEM
TO MAKE ME LUNCH

17:31.834 --> 17:33.567
AND PICK ME UP
FROM CAMP.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.967
OH, I DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOU
THE WORST THING THEY DID.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.200
WHAT DID THEY DO?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.300
HEY!

17:40.300 --> 17:43.100
THEY WORE THAT.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.500
HOT CONCERT, HUH?

17:44.500 --> 17:45.934
YEAH, HOT, DAD.

17:45.934 --> 17:48.233
WHAT'S THE MATTER? DIDN'T
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD TIME?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.800
I HAD A GOOD TIME.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.800
OH, YEAH,
I HAD A GOOD TIME.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.000
TIME OF MY LIFE!

17:52.000 --> 17:53.233
COME ON, HEATHER.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.700
ERIC, WHAT
IS THE PROBLEM?

17:55.700 --> 17:58.100
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT I'VE WAITED ALL YEAR

17:58.100 --> 17:59.800
TO TAKE HEATHER
TO THE AEROSMITH CONCERT.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.000
WHEN I FINALLY DO,

18:01.000 --> 18:02.500
I SHOULD BE HAVING
THE TIME OF MY LIFE.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.967
BUT I'M NOT.
YOU KNOW WHY?

18:03.967 --> 18:04.967
NO, WHY?

18:04.967 --> 18:06.000
CORY.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.467
WHAT? I'M INVOLVED.
THIS IS INTERESTING.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.300
BECAUSE MY PARENTS
ARE HAVING MY GOOD TIME.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.467
IN BETTER SEATS.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.400
WHY SHOULD OUR GOOD TIME

18:16.400 --> 18:17.500
GET IN THE WAY
OF YOUR GOOD TIME?

18:17.500 --> 18:19.100
YOU'RE MY PARENTS!

18:19.100 --> 18:21.000
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ANY FUN.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.467
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SIT HERE

18:22.467 --> 18:23.834
AND WAIT FOR ME
TO GET HOME.

18:23.834 --> 18:25.200
AND HOW COME
I'M HOME FIRST?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.867
WE HAD BACKSTAGE PASSES.

18:26.867 --> 18:29.600
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
CORY, MOVE OVER.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.200
I'M SITTING NEXT TO YOU
IN THE LOSER'S COUCH.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.700
YOU LOST THAT
GEOGRAPHY THING,

18:33.700 --> 18:34.900
AND I LOST MY MUSIC,
MY PARENTS,

18:34.900 --> 18:36.500
MY ENTIRE GENERATION.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.133
I STUDIED GEOGRAPHY
FOR THE LAST 300 HOURS,

18:39.133 --> 18:41.000
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO SHOW FOR IT.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.600
I HAD TO WAIT
IN LINE ALL NIGHT

18:42.600 --> 18:44.100
TO GET THOSE TICKETS.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.000
THE ONLY THING I HAVE
TO SHOW FOR IT IS...

18:47.000 --> 18:49.133
SONNY AND CHER.

18:49.133 --> 18:52.700
ERIC, I'M SORRY, AND I KNOW
IT'S TOUGH TO HEAR THIS,

18:52.700 --> 18:54.934
BUT YOUR MOTHER AND I
ARE AT AN AWKWARD AGE.

18:54.934 --> 18:58.000
WE'RE PARENTS,
BUT WE'RE NOT DEAD YET.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.500
FINE. GLAD SOMEBODY
HAD A GOOD TIME.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.600
COME ON, HEATHER.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.200
ERIC, STOP RIGHT THERE.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.500
SIT BACK IN THAT COUCH,
BOTH OF YOU.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.900
JOIN ME
ON THE COUCH, HEATHER?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.133
CORY, UPSTAIRS.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.000
WHY? I'M NOT
REMOTELY TIRED.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.133
CORY.

19:20.133 --> 19:23.100
BUT SUDDENLY, I'M
OVERCOME WITH FATIGUE.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.567
COME ON, SWEETIE.

19:24.567 --> 19:28.300
BUT I WANT TO WATCH
ERIC GET YELLED AT.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.000
LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES
FOR THAT.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.834
YOU KNOW, DAD, IT REALLY
WOULDN'T BE TOO COOL

19:32.834 --> 19:35.400
TO START YELLING AT ME
IN FRONT OF MY GIRLFRIEND.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.000
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.500
I HAD A FATHER
LIKE THE ONE YOU WANT.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.734
BUT WHAT I WANTED

19:41.734 --> 19:46.300
WAS A FATHER LIKE
THE ONE YOU GOT.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.734
LIVE WITH IT.

19:50.300 --> 19:55.100
DID MY PARENTS JUST
LEAVE US ALONE...TOGETHER?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.200
YEAH, I THINK
THEY JUST DID.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.667
I'M THE LUCKY BOY
WITH THE COOL PARENTS.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.100
NOT THAT COOL!

20:11.834 --> 20:12.767
[BELL RINGS]

20:15.500 --> 20:16.600
MR. MINKUS...

20:16.600 --> 20:19.133
I SEE YOU'VE ABANDONED
YOUR MTV LOOK.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.834
WELL, NOTHING AGAINST
CINDY CRAWFORD,

20:21.834 --> 20:25.400
BUT I'M MORE OF A
CONNIE CHUNG KIND OF GUY.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.600
WELL, SOMETIMES A MAN
DOESN'T KNOW HIMSELF

20:29.600 --> 20:31.300
UNTIL HE'S WALKED
A MILE

20:31.300 --> 20:33.667
IN ANOTHER MAN'S
HUMUNGOUS PANTS.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.467
HEY, MINKUS.
WHO OWNS THE TUAMOTUS?

20:39.467 --> 20:40.600
FRANCE.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.934
OH.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.567
HE WOULD'VE BROUGHT HOME
THE BIG 6, WOULDN'T HE?

20:49.567 --> 20:51.233
VERY LIKELY.

20:53.667 --> 20:57.100
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I TRIED MY HARDEST.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.967
DID YOU?

20:58.967 --> 21:02.400
DO YOU REALLY FEEL
YOU GAVE IT YOUR BEST,

21:02.400 --> 21:03.400
THAT YOU STUDIED

21:03.400 --> 21:05.500
AS HARD AS
YOU POSSIBLY COULD?

21:05.500 --> 21:06.900
YEAH, I DO.

21:09.467 --> 21:12.734
YOU KNOW, MR. MATTHEWS,
MANY 15th CENTURY EXPLORERS

21:12.734 --> 21:15.500
BELIEVED THAT GEOGRAPHY
MEANT TAKING

21:15.500 --> 21:18.500
THEIR LITTLE BOAT
AS FAR AS IT COULD GO

21:18.500 --> 21:21.400
BEFORE IT FELL
OFF THE EARTH.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.033
YOU HAVE PUSHED YOURSELF

21:23.033 --> 21:24.967
TO YOUR
FARTHEST LATITUDES.

21:24.967 --> 21:28.000
AND NOT ONLY DID YOU NOT
TOPPLE OVER THE EDGE,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.100
BUT, I BELIEVE,
TOGETHER,

21:30.100 --> 21:33.500
WE HAVE CHARTED
NEW TERRITORY.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.800
WHAT'S THIS?

21:34.800 --> 21:37.033
THAT IS THIS WEEK'S
GEOGRAPHY EXAM.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.767
I GOT AN "A"?

21:38.767 --> 21:40.700
YES, IT'S AN "A."

21:40.700 --> 21:44.600
CONGRATULATIONS,
MR. MATTHEWS.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.600
