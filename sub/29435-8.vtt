Dr. Mallard, would you...?Warren was

10:24.798 --> 10:26.016
on an antidepressant.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.018
Dr. Palmer believes--

10:28.062 --> 10:29.454
and I concur--

10:29.498 --> 10:32.109
that while the poison
was killing him,

10:32.153 --> 10:34.634
it interacted
with this antidepressant

10:34.677 --> 10:37.767
and caused a serotonin crash.

10:37.811 --> 10:38.855
Poor guy--

10:38.899 --> 10:40.117
he was probably
half out of his mind

10:40.161 --> 10:41.597
when he jumped.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.860
As for how the poison
was administered...

10:43.904 --> 10:45.296
Native cultures

10:45.340 --> 10:47.037
have long used batrachotoxin

10:47.081 --> 10:48.691
on their poison arrows.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.562
Yes, but our victim here
is arrowless.

10:50.606 --> 10:51.563
KASIE:
That's because

10:51.607 --> 10:54.392
he was killed by...
Oh.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.872
I thought Gibbs
was down here.

10:55.916 --> 10:58.179
No, he, uh, left.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.442
Left what?The building.

11:00.485 --> 11:01.922
I've got point.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.925
Gibbs doesn't leave.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.361
Is this because of...?Ziva?

11:06.404 --> 11:07.449
No, no.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.537
Look, officially,

11:08.580 --> 11:10.278
I don't know
why Gibbs left, okay?

11:10.321 --> 11:11.496
But unofficially,

11:11.540 --> 11:12.846
I heard that he's got a friend

11:12.889 --> 11:14.630
who might need help.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.719
Well, that really
narrows it down, McGee.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.808
The man only has one friend.

11:18.852 --> 11:22.203
Oh, dear, don't tell me it's
Fornell's daughter again.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.770
Look, if we want to help,

11:23.813 --> 11:25.728
we help by doing our jobs.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.948
Starting with you, Kasie.
Poison-- what do you got?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.472
Somebody spiked
his clarinet reed.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.779
And going by the decomp rate,
they actually could've done it

11:32.822 --> 11:34.955
a few hours
before he was killed.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.652
So, it wasn't necessarily
someone on the bus.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.480
Could be anyone.Well...

11:38.523 --> 11:40.743
anyone who had access
to his clarinet.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.965
TORRES:
Did you know

11:45.008 --> 11:46.488
"Anchors Aweigh" was written

11:46.531 --> 11:49.534
for an Army/Navy
football game in 1906?

11:49.578 --> 11:51.232
No, I didn't.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.669
I'm kind of liking
this new musical Torres.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.237
Yeah, who knew nerd stuff
could be so relaxing?[scoffs]

11:56.280 --> 11:59.675
Just don't expect me to start
eating fish sticks.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.198
McGee has issues.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.591
Has there
been any news?

12:02.634 --> 12:04.332
No, uh, not yet.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.073
We still have
a few questions for you.Well, hopefully,

12:06.116 --> 12:08.075
we have answers.
Anything we can do to help.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.077
Who had access
to the band's equipment?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.079
Aside from me, everyone.
I mean, we keep it

12:12.122 --> 12:13.558
all locked up when we travel,
but everyone

12:13.602 --> 12:15.212
in the band
has a key to the lockers.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.997
We trust each other
with our instruments.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.521
And speaking of instruments,
when can I pick them up?

12:19.564 --> 12:21.915
FARZAD:
We have a concert
Friday night and

12:21.958 --> 12:23.394
a cappella really
isn't our thing.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.309
But John would want
the show to go on.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.311
We're dedicating
the performance to him.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.748
Our forensic tech
is processing the instruments

12:28.791 --> 12:30.619
as fast as she can.
She just needs

12:30.662 --> 12:32.447
to make sure there's
no poison anywhere else.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.884
In fact, we're gonna
have to take the rest

12:34.928 --> 12:36.625
of the equipment,
just to be safe.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.975
Poison?Someone laced John's reed

12:39.019 --> 12:42.109
with a fast-acting poison.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.720
Mm, no, they didn't.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.113
We understand this is
hard to process, but...

12:46.156 --> 12:49.594
No, I mean that's
not John's reed.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.814
That reed's a 3.5.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.076
John uses a two.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.035
I mean used.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.646
Oh, yeah, of course.
Can you translate?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.517
John was
a jazz player.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.869
He liked a softer reed
for the lower range.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.741
There's only one
person in the band

13:05.785 --> 13:07.221
who uses that kind of reed.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.571
And who would that be?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.748
Hannah.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.010
[knocking]

13:14.054 --> 13:15.011
NCIS.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.970
Hannah McClain, open up.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.583
Federal agents.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.628
Well, she's
definitely home,

13:23.672 --> 13:25.587
because we saw
movement in the window.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.110
Should I kick it in?

13:27.154 --> 13:28.546
Wh... Really?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.810
I thought you were Mr. Calm,
Cool and Musical now.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.246
Oh, I'm calm and cool.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.422
But it's been six months
since I've kicked in a door.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.250
And there's a murder suspect
on the other side

13:36.293 --> 13:37.904
and we have a warrant.Don't you think

13:37.947 --> 13:39.819
Gibbs would want us
to give her another minute?

13:41.168 --> 13:42.560
NCIS!

13:42.604 --> 13:44.258
We're coming in!

13:44.301 --> 13:46.260
[muffled music playing]

13:47.957 --> 13:49.045
Okay, you were right.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.786
We should've
given her a minute.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.831
Mm-hmm.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.141
[gasps]
What the hell is going on here?

13:58.185 --> 13:59.926
NCIS.Yeah, I remember.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.536
What are you doing
in my apartment?

14:01.579 --> 14:02.624
We have a warrant.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.321
Good for you.
A warrant for what?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.062
Poison.Excuse me?

14:06.106 --> 14:07.150
Specifically...

14:07.194 --> 14:09.022
the poison found on this.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.284
Well, what is that?

14:10.327 --> 14:12.939
You don't recognize it?

14:12.982 --> 14:15.289
It's a clarinet reed.
The same kind I use.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.725
See where we're going
with this?Uh, no.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.727
Maybe you should
use smaller words.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.076
Your friend didn't kill himself.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.297
He was poisoned
with a poison-coated reed.

14:23.340 --> 14:26.256
Which your conductor said
belonged to you.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.389
Is "you" a small-enough
word for you?

14:28.432 --> 14:29.869
You think I...

14:29.912 --> 14:31.566
Killed your bandmate?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.784
Yep.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.003
No.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.657
There has got to be
a mistake here.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.224
Yo, dawg.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.617
[scoffs]

14:39.661 --> 14:41.358
You do this, bro?

14:41.402 --> 14:43.360
E-6! [chuckles]

14:43.404 --> 14:45.754
You can cover it.What? Cover it?

14:45.797 --> 14:48.496
Our landlord is gonna be
so pissed off about this.

14:48.539 --> 14:49.932
No, screw the landlord.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.195
These lunatics
think that I killed John

14:52.239 --> 14:53.805
with a poison reed.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.459
You wouldn't happen to
know anything about that?

14:55.503 --> 14:56.460
Dawg?

14:56.504 --> 14:58.158
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.899
I gave John that reed.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.378
Uh, he broke
his last one on the bus,

15:01.422 --> 15:03.076
so I tossed him one of yours
while you were

15:03.119 --> 15:04.338
in the back flirting
with that drummer.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.470
I had no idea
there was poison on it.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.168
I was not flirting...

15:08.211 --> 15:10.605
Wait a minute.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.955
You got that from my bag.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.261
But if
the poison

15:14.304 --> 15:16.698
was on my reed, that means...

15:16.741 --> 15:18.613
That means that...

15:18.656 --> 15:20.920
you were the real target.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.629
Why would someone
try to kill me?

15:34.672 --> 15:37.675
I'm, like, super
likable, right?

15:38.763 --> 15:39.939
Um...I mean, uh, okay,

15:39.982 --> 15:41.114
I know I speak my mind.

15:41.157 --> 15:43.116
And that's not
everyone's thing,

15:43.159 --> 15:44.944
but tell me to shut up.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.293
Don't-don't try to kill me.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.642
I sense there was maybe
some tension between

15:47.685 --> 15:49.644
you and the rest of the band?Yes.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.733
But that's normal when
someone joins an ensemble.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.474
And part of my new job

15:53.517 --> 15:55.650
was to handle the
booking schedule.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.130
And when I put
in that request

15:57.173 --> 15:59.480
to switch our touring area
to Europe,

15:59.523 --> 16:02.744
I mean, that made me
real popular, real fast.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.834
John was actually
the most excited.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.183
He'd never been.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.751
And he never will.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.014
He's dead because of me.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.844
If he just hadn't
have used my reed...No, John

16:15.887 --> 16:18.412
is dead because
someone poisoned him.

16:18.455 --> 16:21.023
Now, I want you to think
real hard here.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.330
Is there anyone that
ever acted suspicious

16:23.373 --> 16:25.941
in or around the band?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.595
Oh, you know,
I never thought of it

16:27.638 --> 16:29.510
because we always just
used to laugh about it,

16:29.553 --> 16:31.207
but the band does have this...

16:31.251 --> 16:34.036
this weird-as-hell
superfan guy.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.037
Weird how?

16:35.081 --> 16:36.517
Stalker weird.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.259
Yeah, he-he comes to every
performance in D.C.

16:39.302 --> 16:42.044
He's always poking around
backstage for autographs.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.047
He even comes to the airport
when we come back from tours.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.875
I tried being nice
to him, but...

16:46.918 --> 16:49.051
but now I-I keep
my distance.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.271
Did you see him at the airport
before you got on the bus?

16:51.314 --> 16:52.881
I-I don't know.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.056
It's hard to keep track.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.753
Well, does superfan have a name?

16:55.797 --> 16:59.061
Um, we call him
the Nugget Creeper.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.542
Because he-he wears this hat

17:01.585 --> 17:03.979
with a-a...
a fast-food logo on it.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.938
Can you help one of our agents
do a composite?

17:06.982 --> 17:09.550
Yeah.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.943
WOMAN:
Sorry, we don't have
any tables.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.597
One should open up soon.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.556
Thanks very much.Mm-hmm.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.905
[indistinct chatter]

17:19.081 --> 17:20.430
[clears throat]

17:22.780 --> 17:24.652
Excuse me, ma'am?

17:24.695 --> 17:26.262
You wouldn't happen
to be finishing up

17:26.306 --> 17:27.829
your coffee anytime soon,
would you?

17:27.872 --> 17:30.397
I've just a few pages
left in my chapter.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.920
Oh, good, good.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.443
Oh...

17:33.487 --> 17:36.664
I don't mean "good"
like I want you to leave.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.100
But good there'll be
an empty seat.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.580
My daughter's coming.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.843
Oh... that's lovely.

17:41.886 --> 17:43.236
Mm... well, she's my...

17:43.279 --> 17:45.629
biological daughter.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.675
And it's
a big moment for us.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.069
Last time we talked,

17:50.112 --> 17:51.722
she didn't
want to have

17:51.766 --> 17:52.810
anything to do with me.

17:52.854 --> 17:55.378
So, you can imagine my surprise

17:55.422 --> 17:57.250
when she asked me here.

17:57.293 --> 17:58.729
Oh...

17:58.773 --> 18:01.297
Such a bumpy road.
Oh, my.

18:01.341 --> 18:04.083
So when she walks in today,
I, uh...

18:04.126 --> 18:06.085
I want her to feel

18:06.128 --> 18:07.738
welcome.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.176
To know that I'm holding
a place for her.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.221
She's... she's really
struggling

18:12.265 --> 18:14.397
with, uh, feelings
of abandonment,

18:14.441 --> 18:16.182
which only seem right.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.227
And I'm sure she thinks
that I gave her up

18:18.271 --> 18:19.837
because I didn't love her,
but the truth is

18:19.881 --> 18:21.709
I gave her up
because I did love her.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.537
Ah...

18:23.580 --> 18:25.539
I'm so sorry.
[laughs]

18:25.582 --> 18:28.063
I'm really sorry.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.414
You know, there is
a lot of research

18:31.458 --> 18:33.242
in the psychological canon

18:33.286 --> 18:34.765
about how it's easier

18:34.809 --> 18:37.333
to open up to a stranger
than a friend.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.902
I think I'll finish
my chapter at home.

18:44.384 --> 18:46.560
Bye, now.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.139
[door opens]

19:00.182 --> 19:01.183
KASIE:
Wow.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.750
MCGEE:
Wow, you see our guy?

19:02.793 --> 19:05.622
Who knew people waited
this long for autographs?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.146
And they say jazz is dead.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.495
Find anything on your end?

19:08.538 --> 19:09.887
No.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.715
And I scrubbed through
three other angles

19:11.759 --> 19:14.065
from four different
concert dates last night.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.980
Plus, my wire crimper broke

19:16.024 --> 19:17.852
so I got nothing done
with my smart speaker.

19:17.895 --> 19:20.289
Ooh, at least I know what I'm
getting you for Christmas now.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.899
You know,
for a creepy stalker guy,

19:21.943 --> 19:24.163
this guy doesn't really
do a lot of stalking.I'm actually

19:24.206 --> 19:26.643
not mad if it takes him
a while to show up.

19:26.687 --> 19:30.256
I have 2,500 pounds
of band equipment

19:30.299 --> 19:31.605
to swab and process.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.650
And it is boring.

19:33.694 --> 19:34.912
This

19:34.956 --> 19:36.305
is way more fun.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.351
So much human drama.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.222
That is some serious
angry hand waving.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.702
You know what,

19:41.745 --> 19:43.486
if they're not wearing
a fast food hat, I don't care.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.662
Oh, if you don't turn
that frown upside down,

19:45.706 --> 19:47.273
I am swapping you out
for Torres.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.970
He's all kinds
of giddy on this case.

19:49.013 --> 19:50.232
Yeah, well,
he doesn't have kids.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.929
No, but he's going
to have a piccolo.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.627
I helped him
order one last night.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.977
Yeah, wait till he realizes
how much practicing that's

19:56.020 --> 19:58.327
gonna cut into
his gym time.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.286
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second,
hold it right there.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.767
Punch in.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
Ned's Nuggets--
that's our creeper.Wow,

20:06.292 --> 20:07.989
good sketch, Bishop.

20:08.032 --> 20:11.862
Facial recognition,
here I come.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.516
BISHOP:
Andrew Hopper, age 50.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.605
Had several prior run-ins
with the law.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.651
He worked at a place
called Ned's Nuggets

20:17.694 --> 20:19.696
in Ivy City-- I've
actually been there.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.871
Nuggets are legit.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.134
Hmm.Put your fish sticks to shame.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.180
Hey, nothing puts
my fish sticks to shame.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.661
Okay, boys. Grown-up time.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.532
Starting with:
I'm not sure this is our guy.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.882
Superfan, yes.
Killer stalker?

20:31.926 --> 20:34.711
I don't know.Six arrests in the
last five years.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.278
Always lurking
around the band,

20:36.322 --> 20:37.975
probably on the night
in question.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.542
I mean, what's
not to like?Mm,

20:39.586 --> 20:41.370
his priors are minor
drug possession,

20:41.414 --> 20:43.503
probation violation,
rinse, repeat.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.027
You really think
this guy turned violent?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.594
Well, let's
ask the pro.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.248
Oh, sorry I'm late, guys.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.510
Jack, hey, we could
use some help.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.033
We've got a video...

20:52.076 --> 20:54.253
Just send it up.
I'll take a look when I can.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.300
I mean, is it me
or was she walking

20:58.344 --> 21:01.303
with a great deal of bad juju?Not just you.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.783
No, she's been acting
really squirrelly ever since

21:02.826 --> 21:04.263
she got that mystery text.Well,

21:04.306 --> 21:05.699
if she needs to talk to us,
she knows

21:05.742 --> 21:07.048
where to find us.
In the meantime,

21:07.091 --> 21:08.441
Gibbs could check in
at any moment

21:08.484 --> 21:09.877
and we still
don't have a killer.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.965
Maybe we do.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.706
Well, nugget champ,

21:12.749 --> 21:15.012
why don't you, uh,
take Bishop and go find out?

21:15.056 --> 21:17.363
What are you doing?I am gonna borrow
Gibbs' Leatherman.

21:17.406 --> 21:20.322
I'm gonna crimp some cables
and read up on our suspect.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.151
Are you out of your mind?

21:23.194 --> 21:24.544
For a guy making
a smart speaker,

21:24.587 --> 21:26.372
this is a real dumb move.

21:26.415 --> 21:28.156
Calm down. It's fine.
Gibbs would be happy

21:28.199 --> 21:30.158
to let me borrow it, okay?TORRES:
Uh, no.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.334
Not even close.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.031
That's strange.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.381
Gibbs left his cell phone.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.121
Maybe he didn't want
to be bothered.

21:39.385 --> 21:41.256
And his wallet and badge?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.215
Oh. You guys get the feeling

21:44.259 --> 21:46.348
that Gibbs isn't telling us
something?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.832
BISHOP:
Leaving his cell phone

21:51.875 --> 21:55.923
I get, but his wallet and badge?

21:55.966 --> 21:58.752
I have a funny feeling this has
nada to do with Emily Fornell.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.188
What if Gibbs needs our help?

22:00.231 --> 22:02.495
Well, we've been
down this road before.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.845
If he needs it,

22:04.888 --> 22:07.021
he'll ask.

22:07.064 --> 22:09.110
Okay.

22:09.153 --> 22:12.679
And maybe he really is helping
Fornell and just left his

22:12.722 --> 22:15.812
money, phone and badge,
because...

22:15.856 --> 22:19.599
Because his pants were...
too tight?

22:19.642 --> 22:20.817
Mm-hmm.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.471
Two o'clock.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.390
Hey. Federal agents.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.870
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.828
NCIS! Freeze!

22:33.047 --> 22:34.875
[grunting]You going somewhere, Andy?

22:34.918 --> 22:36.006
Yeah. Home.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.791
You need zip ties

22:37.834 --> 22:39.488
and a hood to make nuggets?

22:39.532 --> 22:40.533
Let me go!

22:43.492 --> 22:45.842
What we got?

22:45.886 --> 22:47.322
It's a nice collection.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.976
ANDY:
That's private. Stop.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.413
Andrew Hopper, you're under
arrest for the murder

22:51.457 --> 22:54.808
of Musician First Class
John Warren and attempted murder

22:54.851 --> 22:57.332
of Musician First
Class Hannah McClain.ANDY: Idiots!

22:57.376 --> 22:58.986
You're ruining everything.Ruining what--

22:59.029 --> 23:00.335
you kidnapping Hannah?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.468
Or chopping her
into nugget pieces?

23:02.511 --> 23:04.383
No. You've got it
all wrong.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.645
Says the guy
with the zip ties and the hood.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.038
Pretty comfortable
with attempted murder.

23:08.082 --> 23:09.736
No, you have to listen to me.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.259
I'm not trying to kill Hannah.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.739
I'm trying to protect her.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.710
Well, this guy
is clearly crazy.

23:27.754 --> 23:30.539
But he's a crazy guy
with an alibi.

23:30.583 --> 23:31.975
I thought Hannah said
she saw him

23:32.019 --> 23:33.412
at the airport
before the bus ride.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.804
Yeah, she said
she maybesaw him.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.240
Turns out,
he was working

23:36.284 --> 23:38.068
a double shift
when Warren was poisoned.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.722
He may be a stalker, but...

23:39.766 --> 23:41.158
he's not our killer.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.812
Said he was trying
to protect her.

23:42.856 --> 23:44.553
Wonder what he meant.BISHOP: Looks like

23:44.597 --> 23:46.337
somebody had big plans.

23:46.381 --> 23:48.775
I already told you. I wasn't
going to hurt Hannah.

23:48.818 --> 23:51.908
Right. You were... you were,
what again-- protecting her?

23:51.952 --> 23:54.433
You're mocking me,
and I don't talk to mockers.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.609
Not about something
this important.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.481
Okay, let's try
this again.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.745
Why were you stalking
the Anchor Ensemble?

24:02.789 --> 24:04.573
I'm not a stalker.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.967
I'm an Anchorbird.A what?

24:07.010 --> 24:08.359
An Anchorbird.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.492
Someone who follows
the Anchor Ensemble?

24:10.536 --> 24:12.146
I used to be a Deadhead
back in the day.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.539
You've heard of that, right?Yes.

24:13.582 --> 24:15.628
I have heard
of the Grateful Dead.Then I moved on.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.020
Became a Juggalo.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.544
Do you get me now?Sure.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.155
Insane Clown Posse,

24:21.198 --> 24:24.201
Naval ceremonial band.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.334
I totally see the similarity.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.379
My tastes have matured, okay?

24:29.555 --> 24:33.254
So... why were you
protecting Hannah?

24:34.124 --> 24:37.040
From what?

24:37.084 --> 24:39.347
Look, we have an airtight case
for stalking.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.392
If you go to prison,
it'll be for a long time,

24:41.436 --> 24:43.046
and you won't be able
to protect anybody.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.744
If you let us help you,

24:44.787 --> 24:46.746
we can help you protect Hannah.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.446
The Anchor Ensemble--

24:51.490 --> 24:53.709
it isn't just an ordinary band.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.451
Go on.I've overheard some
things hanging out

24:56.495 --> 24:59.280
at the backstage doors,
trying to get autographs.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.282
Some of the members--

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
they're into
some pretty freaky stuff.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.547
Freaky like what?I don't know

25:05.591 --> 25:07.723
much about it,
but I know they meet in secret.

25:07.767 --> 25:10.509
Like Skull and Bones secret.And do what?

25:10.552 --> 25:13.207
Freaky Skull and Bones stuff.
How am I supposed to know?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.687
All I know for
sure is that

25:14.730 --> 25:16.123
the last three band members

25:16.166 --> 25:17.690
to be recruited
into this thing--

25:17.733 --> 25:19.387
they disappeared. Poof.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.258
I'm not the one you
should be talking to.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.565
You shouldbe talking
to the conductor.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.828
I'm pretty sure
he's running the whole thing.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.482
Well, he would be.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.875
Because he's the conductor.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.181
Right?I'm telling you,
there's a trail of bodies.

25:31.225 --> 25:34.228
You want proof?
Go ahead and check. You'll see.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.664
VANCE:
Agent McGee, please

25:35.708 --> 25:37.623
don't tell me
you really believe this guy--

25:37.666 --> 25:41.452
that there's a "trail of bodies"
from a "freaky secret cult"?

25:41.496 --> 25:43.672
I know. It-it sounded
crazy to us, too.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.239
But then we started digging.No amount

25:45.282 --> 25:46.545
of digging is gonna
make this not sound crazy.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.937
It turns out

25:47.981 --> 25:50.026
that three band members
have recently disappeared.

25:50.070 --> 25:52.028
Now, we're still going
down the list of names

25:52.072 --> 25:55.902
that Hopper gave us, but one was
active duty, and is now U.A.

25:55.945 --> 25:57.556
Another was abruptly

25:57.599 --> 26:00.080
discharged and has gone
completely off the grid.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.125
And a third has died.

26:02.169 --> 26:03.562
How?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.172
Jimmy's waiting on
the medical records.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.521
But you got to admit..."Trail of bodies"

26:06.565 --> 26:08.044
doesn't seem so crazy anymore.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.916
Have you spoken
to the conductor?

26:09.959 --> 26:12.440
Uh, we can't find him.
His wife thinks

26:12.483 --> 26:14.964
he's on a trip with the
band, which is a lie.

26:15.008 --> 26:18.620
You pinged his cell?Yeah. Battery's been taken out
of his phone, most likely.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.144
Hasn't connected to a cell
tower since yesterday.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.451
He's running.Looks like it.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.758
Any idea
how Hannah fits into all this?Oh, no clue.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.499
We need to talk to her again,
because our stalker seems

26:28.543 --> 26:31.633
to think that she's the next
"recruit," whatever that means.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.766
Well, get on it.
SECNAV wants to make sure

26:33.809 --> 26:36.116
that the band is safe
before their concert on Friday.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.335
They're playing
Admiral Lance's retirement.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.120
KASIE:
And speaking of concerts,

26:40.163 --> 26:41.991
the equipment manager
is all up in my grill

26:42.035 --> 26:43.602
about the instruments.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.604
Apparently, the band's
not big on a cappella,

26:45.647 --> 26:46.996
or so I keep hearing.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.651
I'm done processing it all.
Can I return it?

26:49.695 --> 26:51.610
Sure.All right,
let's get back to work.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.176
Let's get this solved

26:53.220 --> 26:54.917
before anybody else gets hurt.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.745
KASIE:
I like a cappella.

26:56.789 --> 27:00.531
Agent McGee, did Gibbs tell you
where he was going?

27:00.575 --> 27:02.185
Uh... not directly.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.100
Why? What have...
what have you heard?

27:04.144 --> 27:07.364
The official story is
that he's taking a few days off.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.889
Sturgeon season.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.674
Okay.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.676
Anything else you'd like to add?

27:14.720 --> 27:17.636
Uh... no?

27:17.679 --> 27:20.073
Okay.

27:21.117 --> 27:23.119
Okay.

27:26.340 --> 27:29.082
[classical music playing]Hey, Ducky.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.474
I was hoping you could
help me with something.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.216
Of course.
How can I be of service?[machine beeps]

27:33.260 --> 27:37.090
Well, I was doing the
profiles of the band members

27:37.133 --> 27:39.919
to see who might be
capable of murder, but now,

27:39.962 --> 27:43.096
since the secret society
is thrown on the table,

27:43.139 --> 27:45.315
I'm thinking it's
more your territory.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.143
Now don't tell me
you've read my...

27:47.187 --> 27:49.232
Your case study
on the Molly Maguires,

27:49.276 --> 27:51.147
everyone's favorite
19th century

27:51.191 --> 27:53.454
secret society
with a body count.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.283
It's an extremely rich case,
but, uh, sit down.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.980
[music stops]Ah.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.896
Yes, while I'm flattered that
you're one of three people alive

28:00.940 --> 28:04.160
who's read my paper,
I suspect that's not

28:04.204 --> 28:06.946
the only reason you're here.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.731
And why would you suspect that?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.864
That's the third time
that you've walked by my door,

28:11.907 --> 28:13.430
you're clutching that envelope

28:13.474 --> 28:16.738
as if your life depends
upon it, and I gather

28:16.782 --> 28:19.785
that you're deciding whether
or not to ask me something,

28:19.828 --> 28:23.484
since Gibbs is not here
to lend an ear.

28:23.527 --> 28:26.008
Hmm. So this is what
it's like to be profiled.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.444
[laughs]

28:27.488 --> 28:29.055
It's a little,
uh, disconcerting

28:29.098 --> 28:30.534
when the shoe's
on the other foot.

28:30.578 --> 28:33.712
[clears throat]
Yes.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.714
There is something only

28:35.757 --> 28:37.367
a few people know about me.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.891
I have a daughter.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.675
I gave her up for adoption

28:40.719 --> 28:42.895
28 years ago.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.855
And you don't look
at all surprised.

28:46.899 --> 28:52.426
The maternal instinct
is not so easy to hide.

28:52.469 --> 28:55.255
She asked me
to meet her yesterday.

28:55.298 --> 28:58.606
And, uh, honestly, I don't know
what to make of it.

28:58.649 --> 28:59.781
What happened?

29:00.826 --> 29:03.350
She walked in,

29:03.393 --> 29:07.093
made 30 seconds of small talk,

29:07.136 --> 29:10.487
and then... she asked me
to fill these out.

29:10.531 --> 29:12.489
When I...

29:12.533 --> 29:14.491
asked her if everything
was okay,

29:14.535 --> 29:17.494
she said she didn't want
to talk about it,

29:17.538 --> 29:21.020
and then she just got up
and walked out again.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.674
Medical history forms.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.676
And quite extensive, too.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.635
Please tell me
I'm wrong about why

29:27.678 --> 29:29.985
she would need me
to fill these forms out.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.944
Well, generally,
she would be dealing

29:31.987 --> 29:35.164
with a serious medical condition
that required full

29:35.208 --> 29:38.037
family history.Exactly, right?
I knew it. She's sick.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.300
Well, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

29:40.343 --> 29:43.172
There are other reasons
why she might need these.

29:43.216 --> 29:46.393
If she is sick, there must be
something more I can do

29:46.436 --> 29:49.178
than just put "yes" or "no"
on-on a bunch of forms.

29:49.222 --> 29:50.701
Jack,

29:50.745 --> 29:53.530
your daughter has told you
what she needs.Yes,

29:53.574 --> 29:55.532
but there must be
something more.

29:55.576 --> 29:56.969
Like, I could be a donor.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.492
She's told you

29:58.535 --> 30:00.668
what she needs, so right now,

30:00.711 --> 30:02.844
there is only one thing
you must do.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.201
Will you help me, please?

30:12.245 --> 30:15.248
It will be my pleasure.

30:17.076 --> 30:19.861
I-I'm sorry.
What again? What?

30:19.905 --> 30:23.734
S-Some kind of secret
killer band society?

30:23.778 --> 30:26.215
Yeah, it sounds a lot worse
when you say it out loud.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.261
And-and you heard this
from the Nugget Creeper?

30:28.304 --> 30:31.090
That really sounds bad
when you say it out loud.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.788
The problem is, he's not the one
who tried to poison you.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.224
He has an airtight alibi.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.400
Well, I don't know
what to tell you guys.

30:37.444 --> 30:40.403
If I'm supposed to be some
sort of sacrificial lamb

30:40.447 --> 30:43.754
for a-a crazy band cult,
no one told me.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.756
When was the last time
you talked to your conductor?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.584
Uh, he called last night.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.369
From his cell?It sounded
like a cell.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.632
I-I actually didn't recognize
the number.

30:54.417 --> 30:58.247
Wait. You don't think that he's
involved in all of this, right?

30:58.291 --> 30:59.814
What did he say?Uh,

30:59.858 --> 31:02.034
he wanted to tell me
that the European tour

31:02.077 --> 31:04.950
was going through,
and that he was proud of me

31:04.993 --> 31:06.255
for everything
that I'd accomplished

31:06.299 --> 31:08.344
in this first year
with the band.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.346
And, uh...

31:10.390 --> 31:12.827
And... what?

31:14.133 --> 31:16.265
He had something special
planned.

31:18.833 --> 31:21.140
But he-he wouldn't tell me
what it was.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.360
That sounds
extremely bad now that

31:24.404 --> 31:26.449
I say it out loud.Do you have the number
he called from?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.495
Yeah, I'm sure it's
still in my cell phone.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.063
Thanks.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.152
Great. Thanks, Kasie.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.631
Okay.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.372
Kasie's tracing
the number.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.200
So the conductor has
a second cell.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.898
Maybe Gibbs does, too.Yesterday,

31:39.941 --> 31:42.335
I would have said
"no way," but now...

31:42.378 --> 31:44.119
I have no idea.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.948
I mean, maybe he keeps it next
to his second wallet and badge.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.341
Yeah.

31:48.384 --> 31:49.995
What's he doing, McGee?

31:50.038 --> 31:51.779
No idea.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.346
But if Gibbs is up to something,

31:53.389 --> 31:54.956
we got to trust
that he's got a good rea...

31:55.000 --> 31:56.479
KASIE: Hey, McGee.Yeah.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.394
I'll text you a location.Great. Thanks, Kasie.

31:58.438 --> 31:59.961
Okay, at least we have

32:00.005 --> 32:01.963
a location for the conductor.If only Gibbs

32:02.007 --> 32:03.399
were this easy to track.

32:03.443 --> 32:04.923
Yeah.

32:09.623 --> 32:10.580
BISHOP:
Where you been?

32:10.624 --> 32:12.104
And where you going?

32:12.147 --> 32:14.584
And why are you dressed
like a cat burglar?

32:14.628 --> 32:15.672
Or is that

32:15.716 --> 32:17.152
your murder outfit?Murder?

32:17.196 --> 32:18.849
We know about your little group.

32:18.893 --> 32:21.069
Well, whatever
you think you know,

32:21.113 --> 32:22.549
you're wrong.Says the guy

32:22.592 --> 32:24.638
who's lying to his wife
and has two dead Navy musicians

32:24.681 --> 32:26.422
on his watch.

32:26.466 --> 32:27.423
What's the plan
for Hannah?

32:27.467 --> 32:29.121
You're making
a terrible mistake.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.122
Okay, let's hear it.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.040
It's actually
more believable if you...

32:35.083 --> 32:36.955
see for yourselves.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.486
McGEE:
What is this?

32:46.529 --> 32:49.489
We aren't killing anyone.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.926
We're simply honoring our own.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.233
All these musicians
have been killed

32:54.276 --> 32:56.235
serving their country.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.759
And today, we're here for John.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.805
[playing "Naval Hymn"]

33:09.900 --> 33:11.902
♪

33:41.715 --> 33:43.978
So your "freaky secret cult"

33:44.022 --> 33:45.980
wasn't a cult at all?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.809
No. Apparently,
it's a tradition.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.464
Once a year,
select members and alumni
from the Anchor Ensemble

33:51.507 --> 33:55.468
get together to honor Navy
musicians who have passed away.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.035
And Hannah
didn't know about it

33:57.078 --> 33:58.514
because she
hadn't been invited yet.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.647
McGEE: Our band's
first conductor started it

34:00.690 --> 34:03.041
when an entire Navy band
was killed at Pearl Harbor.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.868
It's been going on
ever since.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.305
Almost 80 years.

34:06.348 --> 34:08.176
McGEE: Think you
would've liked it-- it was...

34:08.220 --> 34:09.308
it was really touching.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.136
Touching enough
that you've forgotten

34:11.179 --> 34:12.963
about the three people
who've disappeared?

34:13.007 --> 34:15.270
No. We, uh,
we've actually finished

34:15.314 --> 34:16.793
running those leads down.

34:16.837 --> 34:18.708
BISHOP:
Yeah, the musician
who went U.A.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.362
was actually caring
for a sick parent.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.277
McGEE: And the one who
was discharged did not go

34:22.321 --> 34:23.713
off the grid.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.846
They had faked
their citizenship papers

34:25.889 --> 34:27.413
and, uh, were deported.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.110
And the one who died?Jimmy just finished

34:29.154 --> 34:30.459
reviewing the autopsy report.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.157
He died
of a congenital aneurysm.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.897
So nothing suspicious
about that.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.203
McGEE:
Not unless you're
a crazy stalker

34:35.247 --> 34:36.596
conspiracy theorist.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.206
So we've just burned
an entire day

34:38.250 --> 34:39.860
chasing the rantings
of a lunatic.

34:39.903 --> 34:41.383
What about
the missing conductor?

34:41.427 --> 34:42.341
He cheats on his wife.

34:42.384 --> 34:43.385
Uses another phone

34:43.429 --> 34:44.604
when he's
with his girlfriend.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.345
Three points
for honoring the dead,

34:46.388 --> 34:48.260
not so much
for honoring his vows.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.913
All right, then,
so where are we now?

34:49.957 --> 34:51.132
McGEE:
We're back to square one.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.091
Who tried to kill
Hannah McClain, and why?

34:53.134 --> 34:54.701
Agent McGee,
do I need to remind you

34:54.744 --> 34:57.051
that SECNAV wants
this case closed yesterday?

34:57.095 --> 34:58.705
If we don't button
this up soon,

34:58.748 --> 34:59.836
we're gonna have a problem.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.011
KASIE:
We already have one.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.101
A hundred-pound problem.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.583
So, I played trombone
in middle school,

35:07.627 --> 35:10.325
and after this past week,
I decide to pick it up again.

35:10.369 --> 35:12.327
[sighs]
I do love that slide.

35:12.371 --> 35:13.850
Well, between you
and Nick's piccolo,

35:13.894 --> 35:15.852
you can start your own band.Problem is,

35:15.896 --> 35:17.376
I didn't know
which trombone to get,

35:17.419 --> 35:19.378
so I decided to just order
the same trombone

35:19.421 --> 35:20.944
I had processed
from the crime scene.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.207
Okay, is this
going somewhere?

35:22.250 --> 35:23.077
It is.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.166
Because that's
when I noticed

35:25.210 --> 35:27.081
the crime scene
trombone case was

35:27.125 --> 35:29.257
ten pounds heavier
than the one I just bought.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.564
You must have bought
a different model.Nope.

35:31.607 --> 35:33.957
I triple-checked,
and the crime scene trombone

35:34.001 --> 35:36.612
wasn't the only thing
that was heavier.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.353
I looked up
the manufacturer's specs

35:38.397 --> 35:40.050
for all the instruments

35:40.094 --> 35:42.140
and cases,
and lo and behold,

35:42.183 --> 35:44.142
they were all heavier.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.927
A hundred pounds heavier?

35:46.970 --> 35:49.234
Mm-hmm. And the only way
that could happen

35:49.277 --> 35:52.237
is if something else was
in those cases.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.064
Well, something must
have been hidden pretty well,

35:54.108 --> 35:55.283
because we didn't find it.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.199
And who hides things really well

35:58.243 --> 36:01.942
in cases that travel routinely
across international borders?

36:01.985 --> 36:03.596
Smugglers!Ding, ding, ding!

36:03.639 --> 36:04.988
Jack, hey.
You got something?

36:05.032 --> 36:07.774
I do. And I apologize
for being distracted.

36:07.817 --> 36:10.298
But, um, when Kasie told me
about the weight discrepancies,

36:10.342 --> 36:13.214
I took another look
at the band profiles

36:13.258 --> 36:15.695
to see if anyone flagged
as a possible smuggler.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.958
Say yes--
make me feel even more clever

36:18.001 --> 36:19.481
than I already do.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.831
Yes. Yes. Someone flagged.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.094
Someone who has two cousins
in jail for smuggling

36:24.138 --> 36:27.054
and who is in a perfect position
to sneak contraband

36:27.097 --> 36:30.275
in and out
of those instrument cases.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.456
Careful. Don't want
to throw your back out.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.718
TORRES:
Equipment is heavy, huh?

36:38.761 --> 36:40.067
That's the job.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.286
I got it.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.549
Just like you got
John Warren?

36:44.593 --> 36:46.900
Hey. That was an accident.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.119
I didn't have time to swerve.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.643
You did have time to
poison him, though.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.299
Oh, wait, no, that was
an accident, too.

36:54.342 --> 36:56.823
'Cause your real target
was Hannah.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.259
TORRES:
Remember her?

36:58.303 --> 37:01.436
Why would I want
to kill Hannah?

37:01.480 --> 37:04.874
Because she was pushing the band
to go to Europe for a year.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.007
BISHOP:
Which would have destroyed

37:07.050 --> 37:10.402
your smuggling operation
in South America.

37:10.445 --> 37:11.968
Smuggling operation?

37:12.012 --> 37:13.622
[chuckles]:
What am I smuggling?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.842
Let's take
a look, amigo.

37:15.885 --> 37:19.324
French horn should weigh
about 20 pounds?

37:19.367 --> 37:20.890
Let's see.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.676
[grunts softly]

37:23.719 --> 37:25.155
It's about 26.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.419
Oh, no, it's about 27.

37:27.462 --> 37:30.465
Let's see if there's
a prize inside.

Huh.

37:56.578 --> 37:58.014
You smell something, Nick?

37:59.668 --> 38:01.757
Yep.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.545
The catalytic converter

38:06.588 --> 38:09.417
on my dad's '76 Mustang.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.731
TORRES: Oh, I'd know that smell
anywhere, baby-- that's rhodium.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.907
It's the chief component
in a catalytic converter.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.170
I love the confidence
with which he says something

38:23.213 --> 38:25.564
that makes absolutely
no sense to me.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.130
It's a precious metal
that's also used

38:27.174 --> 38:29.176
in nuclear reactors
and jewelry.

Worth twice as much
as its weight in gold.JIMMY: So,

38:31.787 --> 38:33.572
the equipment manager
was swapping out the linings

38:33.615 --> 38:35.661
of the cases
with rhodium plating?

38:35.704 --> 38:37.576
Yep. He wasn't smuggling
something inthe cases.

38:37.619 --> 38:40.143
It wasthe cases.TORRES:
In a single trip

38:40.187 --> 38:42.276
to South America,
the band could carry home

38:42.320 --> 38:44.931
over a million dollars
of contraband.Yeah,

38:44.974 --> 38:47.107
so when Hannah McClain tried
to move the band to Europe,

38:47.150 --> 38:48.587
the equipment manager
had to do something.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.111
He reached out to his
criminal networks for poison.

38:51.154 --> 38:52.939
JIMMY:
And the rest
is history.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.507
I guess Gibbs is gonna be pretty
happy when he gets back, huh?

38:55.550 --> 38:58.031
Yeah, he will be.
I'm just bummed

38:58.074 --> 39:00.599
I burned through all
my alone time solving this case.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.209
DUCKY:
Come on, guys,
we're gonna be late.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.429
Time to stop jabbering.

39:04.472 --> 39:07.214
So kind of the band
to invite us.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.749
BISHOP:
Hey, look. Gibbs is back.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.969
From where?

39:24.274 --> 39:26.364
Hey.Hey.

39:26.407 --> 39:29.105
Did you catch any sturgeon?

39:29.149 --> 39:30.890
Drink any lattes?

39:30.933 --> 39:33.501
I did, but it didn't go
as I hoped.

39:33.545 --> 39:34.894
Yeah. I heard.

39:34.937 --> 39:37.549
Ducky filled me in.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.116
Faith could be sick,

39:40.160 --> 39:43.337
and-and I'm still
completely cut out.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.210
But she asked for
you to meet her.

39:47.254 --> 39:50.213
Because she needed information.
That's it.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.216
Could've done that

39:53.260 --> 39:54.827
over e-mail.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.616
Thank you.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.926
How's Emily?

40:06.969 --> 40:08.667
She's okay.

40:08.710 --> 40:10.451
For now.

FARZAD:
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to play a song

40:20.548 --> 40:22.289
that means a lot to us,

an ode to someone we lost.
