WEBVTT

00:57.140 --> 00:59.809
Cid better pay us extra for that mission.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.561
Eh. It wasn't so bad.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.900
She failed to mention the drop zone
would be swarming with Gundarks.

01:06.983 --> 01:10.236
It is not the first time
she has left out key details.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.378
-

01:32.717 --> 01:35.011
When did this place get so popular?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.763
And who are they?

01:36.846 --> 01:39.057
Not our problem. Let's find Cid.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.481
Where do you think you're going?

01:52.737 --> 01:55.782
It's rude to barge
into one's office unannounced.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.201
This isn't your office.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.537
Guess again.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.915
-Ruby?
-She's my prized pet.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.626
What are you doing with her?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.504
I paid. Cid delivered.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.589
And where is Cid?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.425
Cid's out.

02:13.508 --> 02:17.595
This parlor and Ord Mantell
are now my territory.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.683
But if you're looking for work,
I might have use for you.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.519
We'll think about it.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.855
You do that.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.151
We're getting off Ord Mantell.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.612
Tech, prep the ship.
The rest of us will gather supplies.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.072
But what about Cid?

02:36.740 --> 02:38.950
What did he mean
when he said she was "out"?

02:39.034 --> 02:40.702
Given his tone,

02:40.785 --> 02:44.998
it is a plausible assumption that Cid
was either forced out or taken out.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.170
Well, we have to find her and help her.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.799
Nice to see one of you cares.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.551
Inside. Now.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.806
So you boys met Roland.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.561
He's a former client
and the son of crime boss Isa Durand.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.982
Roland's trying to make a name for himself
by joining up with the Pykes.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.193
What's he doing on Ord Mantell?

03:13.276 --> 03:17.113
This port's connected
to multiple hyperspace routes,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.865
ideal for smuggling.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.576
My parlor's
right in the middle of the action.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.788
Roland saw the value in it and took it.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.541
But we are taking it back.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.419
-We?
-If I lose, you lose.

03:31.503 --> 03:35.256
Don't forget how good I've been
at keeping secrets.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.883
I believe she's threatening us.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.301
You're quick.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.388
When we needed help,
we came to Cid, remember?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.556
Now she needs help.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.475
We can't just walk away.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.852
You tell 'em, Tiny.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.272
So, what's your plan?

03:53.900 --> 03:57.612
My sources tell me that a buyer
is meeting Roland tonight

03:57.696 --> 04:01.825
to acquire a shipment of spice
he's storing in my back office.

04:01.908 --> 04:05.286
You want to disrupt his supply chain
by stealing the shipment

04:05.370 --> 04:07.372
and thereby sabotaging the deal.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.082
Very good, Goggles.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.834
When the Pykes come to collect,

04:10.917 --> 04:14.671
Roland won't be able to pay,
and he'll be their problem.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.768
Start climbing, tough guys.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.567
Where are we?

04:35.650 --> 04:38.403
Ord Mantell's old mining tunnels.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.364
These rails run underneath the city.

04:41.448 --> 04:45.118
It's how we're sneaking into my parlor
to steal the spice.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.495
Well, why don't we
just walk in there and take it?

04:47.579 --> 04:48.830
We can handle those guards.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.832
No one can know we're involved.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.417
Roland is one thing,

04:52.500 --> 04:55.128
but the Pykes
aren't an enemy you want to make.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.381
We'll use these carts
to transport the crates of spice.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.634
They're not in the best shape,
but I can get the motors operational.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.636
No. Motors are too loud.

05:03.720 --> 05:07.015
This is a stealth mission.
You boys are good at that, right?

05:07.557 --> 05:10.143
Tiny, Goggles, you're with me.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.428
Now, listen up.

05:46.012 --> 05:50.308
When we pass through those doors,
not a peep out of anyone.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.852
We don't want to wake the hive.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.145
The what?

05:54.896 --> 05:59.067
The caverns
have a slight infestation problem.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.404
We're not afraid of a few bugs.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.740
Well, it won't be a problem
if everyone keeps their traps shut.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.076
Big guy, get the door.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.698
- Wha--

06:57.292 --> 06:59.169
What did I say?

06:59.252 --> 07:01.921
It was an accident.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.133
-

07:24.569 --> 07:26.237
Keep moving.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.967
We're here.

07:53.181 --> 07:57.018
This ladder leads into my back office.
Up you go.

07:57.102 --> 08:00.814
Without eyes on the office,
how do we know Roland is not inside?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.607
I've got that covered.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.783
Ruby?

08:54.492 --> 08:57.412
Don't just stand there. Find her!

09:09.591 --> 09:11.551
-All clear.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.236
Ugh. And I thought Wrecker was a slob.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.115
Can the commentary.
Roland won't be gone for long.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.330
Six crates of spice confirmed.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.790
Here. Hand it over.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.307
Where is she?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.393
We looked everywhere. Can't find her.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.269
Keep looking.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.149
Keep that thing quiet.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.693
Give it more mix.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.322
Now you've done it.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.496
Okay. New plan!

10:22.580 --> 10:23.581
You coward!

10:29.713 --> 10:30.714
There you are.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.595
Good girl.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.639
After them.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.644
Out of time, boys.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.147
-Get the last two crates.
- I'll seal the door.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.361
Don't worry.
We'll catch those two and kill them.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.612
Yes, we will.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.034
From now on, you need to stay close.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.723
The spice.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.933
It's gone!

11:35.111 --> 11:37.822
That's secure enough. Let's go.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.994
Found them!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.220
We've got incoming!

12:01.012 --> 12:04.349
-I said no blaster fire.
- Tell that to them!

12:07.644 --> 12:08.561
Huh?

12:22.701 --> 12:25.829
If those laser brains woke the hive,
we're all dead.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.210
What's that sound?

12:38.717 --> 12:40.385
Cid, I don't like this.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.852
Power up the engines!

12:52.147 --> 12:54.441
We've got more coming!

13:10.206 --> 13:12.792
They're avoiding the light.
Use your torches.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.637
Not the spice!

13:34.647 --> 13:38.234
Forget the spice. Let's go!
-Wrecker, seal them in.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.672
Well, at least we got rid of the spice,
right?

14:10.809 --> 14:15.397
I didn't anticipate Cid
to be so bold or foolish.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.274
It-- It was all her idea.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.860
-We swear.
-Yeah, it was a distraction.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.862
We weren't gonna hurt Ruby. Honest.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.907
Tell me where Cid took my spice!

14:26.616 --> 14:30.120
We don't know. She didn't say.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.539
Get them out of here.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.999
Where is our payment?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.836
The shipment was stolen.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.131
You'll get your money,
but I need more time.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.843
We did not come to hear excuses.

14:44.926 --> 14:50.598
If you cannot deliver as promised,
you are of no further use to us.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.103
I said you'll get your money.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.815
I suggest you go back
to Oba Diah and wait.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.652
You are out of your depth, Durand.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.698
Either you correct this grave mistake,

15:06.781 --> 15:13.288
or you and your entire family will
experience what pain truly feels like.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.845
Are you sure your parlor's safe?

15:28.928 --> 15:32.182
Bolo and Ketch said
the Pykes already came for Roland.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.685
I told you they don't take kindly
to unpaid debts.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.325
See? My plan worked like a charm.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.619
Even better than expected.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.708
That's her. She's the one you want.

15:58.792 --> 16:03.546
It has come to my attention that
you have stolen our shipment of spice.

16:04.214 --> 16:09.678
Return it to us,
and we will consider this issue resolved.

16:09.761 --> 16:14.349
Not sure what he's been telling you,
but we don't have any spice.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.227
Kill them all.

16:17.811 --> 16:22.107
Wait. We don't have the spice on us,
but we know where it is.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.069
My patience is wearing very thin.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.530
If you know where the spice is,

16:28.613 --> 16:31.825
then you should have
no problem retrieving it.

16:31.908 --> 16:36.162
Until you do, the child stays here.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.250
Not happening.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.586
You misunderstand.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.339
This is not a negotiation.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.386
If I may…

16:55.015 --> 16:57.767
You all don't realize
who you're dealing with.

16:57.851 --> 17:02.439
If you don't lower your blasters,
we're all gonna wish we were dead.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.108
Let me handle this.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.197
We can't leave Omega with them.

17:11.281 --> 17:15.410
We don't have a choice,
but we know where the spice is.

17:15.493 --> 17:18.663
We'll return it, and the kid will be fine.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.875
The ptero-creatures we encountered
in the cavern are Irlings.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.296
They are nocturnal insects with
visual sensitivity to thermal registers.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.090
Our best chance
is to strike before nightfall.

17:29.674 --> 17:33.928
Muscles and I will rappel down
into the cavern and locate the crates.

17:34.637 --> 17:38.475
I got the kid into this mess,
and I'll get her out.

18:15.679 --> 18:19.140
You've gotta be kidding me.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.352
And this time, don't drop it.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.971
-

18:58.054 --> 18:59.139
-

19:02.308 --> 19:03.727
Found one.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.903
I'll secure it.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.823
Start looking for the other crates.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.324
Quietly.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.884
Don't try it. They'll kill you.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.721
If your friends don't return the spice,
we're both dead.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.767
That's what happens when you meddle
in other people's business.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.310
Us?

19:45.393 --> 19:47.729
You're the one
who took Cid's parlor from her.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.816
You take what you want.
That's the Durand way.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.235
It's a tactic my mother has perfected.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.447
So, she's a criminal too?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.825
Ugh. You make it sound so undignified.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.496
If she saw me now…

20:12.212 --> 20:14.464
Ruby doesn't take a liking to many people.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.218
Don't worry, Ruby. We'll get out of this.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.276
Crates three and four are aboard.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.904
It's almost night.

20:37.987 --> 20:40.281
Those things are gonna wake up.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.617
I am preparing for that possibility.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.129
…in hand.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.422
Rest later.

20:55.505 --> 20:56.673
Final crate secure.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.467
Bring us up.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.229
Quit squirming.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.242
Oh.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.995
Maybe they didn't hear it.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.748
I don't think we're that lucky.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.917
Yeah, me neither.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.683
Get us out of here!

21:48.767 --> 21:50.101
Wrecker. What's going on?

21:50.185 --> 21:52.062
Irlings. Lots of 'em!

21:52.145 --> 21:53.772
Help! Help me! Help me!

21:53.855 --> 21:55.648
Watch out for the spice.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.027
Tech.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.737
This should distract them.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.700
Incoming!

22:27.138 --> 22:31.267
See, Muscles? That wasn't so bad.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.104
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. Phew!

22:47.158 --> 22:52.664
Since the spice has been returned,
the matter between us is resolved.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.792
-But not with you.
-

23:03.008 --> 23:04.342
Don't!

23:05.093 --> 23:07.220
He made a mistake. That's all.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.722
She's right.

23:08.805 --> 23:12.142
Kill him and you'll be starting a war
with Isa Durand.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.436
Do you want that heat right now?

23:15.186 --> 23:17.814
Call this a bad deal and walk away.

23:18.565 --> 23:22.152
We do not accept bad deals.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.745
Our business is finished.

23:32.537 --> 23:36.374
It would not be wise
for our paths to cross again.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.344
Are you okay?

23:48.636 --> 23:50.138
It's a small price to pay.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.021
I'll be going now.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.821
Come on, boys. First round's on me.

24:06.905 --> 24:10.033
You owe us way more than that.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.868
Don't push your luck.

24:17.999 --> 24:22.837
Why did you stick up for him
after what he did?

24:23.922 --> 24:24.923
I don't know.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.716
Ruby likes him.

24:27.550 --> 24:28.885
Maybe he's not all bad.
