00:03.612 --> 00:05.222
Previously onMacGyver...

00:05.266 --> 00:08.443
My name is Ethan.
Let's get you home.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.574
Okay.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.794
MATTY:
Ethan Reigns is my husband.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.230
MacGYVER:
S-Company knows there's

00:13.274 --> 00:14.666
an undercover CIA agent
in the ranks.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.320
They will kill you when
they find out it's you.

00:16.364 --> 00:17.756
Nod if you understand.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.890
Daddy!ETHAN: I met Deena,

00:20.933 --> 00:23.197
and then our daughter was born, and then all of a sudden

00:23.240 --> 00:25.416
the role that
I was playing

00:25.460 --> 00:28.245
in order to survive long enough
to get back to you,

00:28.289 --> 00:30.247
it just became my life.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.257
BOZER:
Mac!

00:40.301 --> 00:41.693
Mac!

00:43.695 --> 00:45.523
That's got to be Mac, right?

00:45.567 --> 00:46.916
Come on, let's go.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.008
Don't stop. Keep going.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.013
Okay. You all right?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.277
You okay?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.283
That was a gunshot.

01:06.762 --> 01:07.719
Come on.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.049
♪ I'm going up the country

01:33.093 --> 01:34.790
♪ Babe, don't you wanna go?

01:36.618 --> 01:38.924
♪ I'm going up the country

01:38.968 --> 01:40.796
♪ Babe, don't you wanna go?

01:42.276 --> 01:43.755
♪ Take you to someplace

01:43.799 --> 01:46.454
♪ I've never been before...

01:46.497 --> 01:49.805
Bozer, you want to hand me
one of those waters back there?

01:49.848 --> 01:51.415
Oh, yeah.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.939
Uh, can't. It's empty.

01:53.983 --> 01:56.681
You forgot to pack the drinks?No. Filled it up
right before we left.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.770
Did someone rob us at
that last rest stop?

01:58.814 --> 02:02.122
Nobody robbed us, Bozer.
I unpacked the cooler.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.515
Why?Because packed
coolers are

02:04.559 --> 02:07.039
for camping trips, and this
is wilderness survival.

02:07.083 --> 02:09.346
We'll be roughing it.And "roughing it" means
no water?

02:09.390 --> 02:11.566
"Roughing it" means
no water, no food,

02:11.609 --> 02:13.872
no cell phone,
certainly, no tent.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.657
Just the three of us
in the great outdoors.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.224
Whatever we need,
we will make it

02:17.267 --> 02:18.921
or we will find it.

02:18.964 --> 02:22.142
So I guess we won't be enjoying
s'mores by the fire later.

02:22.185 --> 02:24.753
Not unless you find yourself
a marshmallow tree.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.102
Matty tasked me

02:26.146 --> 02:27.886
with teaching you guys
primitive survival skills,

02:27.930 --> 02:30.019
because sooner or later
every agent finds themselves

02:30.062 --> 02:32.152
in a situation where
they're gonna need them.

02:32.195 --> 02:35.372
Training never stops for those
of us in our line of business,

02:35.416 --> 02:37.679
and immersive training
is the best training.

02:37.722 --> 02:41.726
It's not the best training
if it, you know... kills us.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.511
♪ 'Cause you got a home, man.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.520
Uh, Mac,

02:52.563 --> 02:53.825
where are we?

02:53.869 --> 02:55.305
'Cause this looks like
the kind of place

02:55.349 --> 02:56.567
where serial killers
get their start.

02:56.611 --> 02:57.960
MacGYVER:
Yeah, well,
it's where

02:58.003 --> 02:59.788
we're gonna drop
the Jeep off--

02:59.831 --> 03:01.485
assuming the owner's
okay with it.

03:01.529 --> 03:02.834
What owner?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.923
Looks like no one's
been here in years.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.448
Hello?
Anyone home?

03:12.714 --> 03:14.629
BOZER:
Oh, God.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.239
He's got a banjo.
I've seen this movie.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.328
I know how it ends.
I die first.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.635
We need to go now.He can hear you.

03:29.905 --> 03:34.126
You folks ain't
from around here.

03:34.170 --> 03:38.348
: That's exactly
how the movie starts.

03:38.392 --> 03:41.351
No, we're from L.A.

03:42.439 --> 03:45.268
Me and my friends here,

03:45.312 --> 03:47.705
we were, um, gonna go
backpacking in Walker Gorge.

03:47.749 --> 03:51.492
You sure you want to give him
all this information, Mac?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.843
Eh, it'll be fine.
And we were wondering

03:54.886 --> 03:56.366
if we could just
leave the Jeep here.

03:56.410 --> 03:59.151
I'd be more than willing to
pay you for your troubles,

03:59.195 --> 04:01.284
if that's okay.Not a good idea

04:01.328 --> 04:04.331
for you three to go off
in those woods.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.246
Uh, maybe we should
just get back on the road, Mac,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.160
find another spot.Yeah, he's giving me,

04:08.204 --> 04:11.338
uh, "kill us in our sleep"
kind of vibes.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.954
MacGYVER:
How you doing, Freddy?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.260
How are you?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.435
MacGYVER:
Nice to see you.Good to see you.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.480
Well, these are my friends--
Bozer, Riley.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.352
This is Freddy.
He owns the place.

04:25.395 --> 04:26.657
You'll have to forgive me.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.616
Ever since Mac started
bringing people here,

04:28.659 --> 04:30.922
we've been having some
fun at their expense.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.533
No hard feelings.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.623
Hey, I'm just glad we're not
gonna get murdered and eaten.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.842
Putting two more newbies through
the grinder, I take it.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.454
That's the plan.Uh-huh. Well,
it's been quiet

04:40.497 --> 04:42.673
ever since last week's rain.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.414
You have the whole
place to yourself.

04:44.458 --> 04:46.024
And don't worry
about that Jeep.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.809
She'll be fine
right there.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.332
All right. Well,
I'll give you these.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.986
All right.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.380
Keys, cell phones, wallets.

04:53.423 --> 04:57.122
Goodbye, modern civilization.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.692
BOZER:
I don't care what Mac says.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.825
He's creepy.All right.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.088
Besides what you're wearing
and the rain gear,

05:06.131 --> 05:10.571
you each get three things: a
backpack, a canteen and a knife.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.529
There a reason these backpacks
are so big?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.096
I mean, we're not taking much.Yeah.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.185
The extra space is for the stuff
you're gonna pick up

05:16.228 --> 05:18.013
along the way that you'll need,
like firewood and food.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.493
Trust me, you'll be glad
you brought them along.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.364
All right, Freddy.
Couple days?

05:21.408 --> 05:22.757
Don't be so sure.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.455
Not everyone
who walks in those woods

05:25.499 --> 05:27.675
walks out.

05:31.287 --> 05:34.072
He's way too good at that.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.864
The sun is your compass.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.866
Right now,
it is to our backs,

05:44.909 --> 05:47.172
which means we're headed
which direction, Riley?

05:47.216 --> 05:49.740
Uh...

05:49.784 --> 05:51.002
west.Very good.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.656
We are 30 miles

05:52.700 --> 05:54.266
from the nearest
ranger station,

05:54.310 --> 05:56.138
70 from the closest thing
to civilization,

05:56.181 --> 05:58.488
so keeping your bearings
out here is imperative,

05:58.532 --> 06:00.360
unless you want to become
a permanent resident.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.364
Would that be so bad?

06:04.407 --> 06:05.582
Haven't been away
from a computer screen

06:05.626 --> 06:06.714
this long since prison.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.368
It's really refreshing,
honestly.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.586
Tell that to
my stomach.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.501
That's not two bears
you're hearing fighting.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.242
It's hunger pains.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.418
Well, I think
I hear a stream nearby.

06:15.462 --> 06:16.767
Gonna teach us how to fish, Mac?

06:16.811 --> 06:17.855
No, fishing
is day three.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.422
Day one is foraging.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.772
Foraging what?
Nothing out here to eat.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.905
Ha. There's plenty. You just got
to know what's edible

06:23.948 --> 06:25.515
and where to look.

06:25.559 --> 06:28.649
Cattails. They're the fast food
of the wilderness.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.521
One for you.RILEY:
Ooh.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.610
Thank you.One for you.
All right.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.619
RILEY:
Hmm.

06:46.318 --> 06:47.407
Tastes like...

06:49.365 --> 06:51.062
...used Q-tips.

06:51.106 --> 06:55.371
If this was my secret ingredient
on Iron Chef,I'd forfeit.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.939
Well, sorry, guys, but you're
gonna have to get used to them,

06:57.982 --> 07:01.246
because we each have
to consume 240 per day...

07:02.378 --> 07:04.119
...to match the energy
we're exerting.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.687
So that's ten very important
calories you just wasted.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.735
I'm sorry, did you say 240?

07:11.779 --> 07:13.389
MacGYVER: Surviving
in the woods ain't easy.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.391
That's why nobody
comes out... here.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.827
Actually,

07:16.871 --> 07:19.351
looks like someone did.RILEY: Guess Fred was wrong.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.657
There are people
out here.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.747
Hmm. People who brought
a lot of equipment

07:23.791 --> 07:25.749
but have no idea
what they're doing.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.925
Can you tell me
what mistakes they made?

07:27.969 --> 07:29.144
Riley?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.494
According
to the wilderness manual,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.148
they didn't ring
their fire with stones

07:33.191 --> 07:34.932
to keep it from spreading, one.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
They left cigarette butts,

07:38.545 --> 07:41.461
which is not only
a fire hazard but...

07:41.504 --> 07:42.679
violates
the Leave No Trace rule.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.898
BOZER: Not
to mention,

07:43.941 --> 07:45.508
extremely rude.Yes.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.336
And they camped
in a valley,

07:47.379 --> 07:49.643
which is a big no-no
because of flash floods.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.732
Very good, Riley.
Only missed one thing.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.517
Cotton fibers.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.824
Why is that bad?Well, out here,

07:56.867 --> 07:58.042
cotton kills.

07:58.086 --> 07:59.609
It gets wet, and it stays wet,

07:59.653 --> 08:02.525
making you vulnerable to
hypothermia every time it rains.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.397
That's why we're
head-to-toe nylon and wool.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.573
Whoever did this,

08:06.616 --> 08:08.662
asking for trouble.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.191
Are you sure about this, Matty?

08:16.234 --> 08:19.281
I mean, it's never too late
to change your mind, you know.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.109
I'll be fine.You sure?

08:21.152 --> 08:23.590
Come on.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.939
Okay.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.597
Dalton?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.513
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.905
Let's go. Come on.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.694
Matty. What are you doing here?

08:40.737 --> 08:41.825
We need to talk.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.220
You could've called.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.265
Honey?

08:50.094 --> 08:51.443
Hey.

08:51.487 --> 08:52.749
Hello.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.535
Matty, is everything okay?

08:55.578 --> 08:58.755
No. That's why we're here.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.627
ETHAN:
I don't understand.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.759
We followed protocol.
We didn't leave a trail.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.935
My family is just settling
into a normal life.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.415
How did this happen?

09:06.458 --> 09:08.635
All I can tell you is
S-Company learned your location.

09:08.678 --> 09:09.592
It's no longer safe here.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.507
You trust the intel?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.943
MATTY: We have a new
asset on the inside.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.597
I trust what she gives us.JACK: Listen, Ethan,

09:14.641 --> 09:16.207
you made S-Company look
like fools for eight years.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.295
They're looking
to make an example

09:17.339 --> 09:18.427
out of you and your family.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.211
This is not up for debate.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.257
Okay? We're going.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.347
When do we leave?

09:35.792 --> 09:37.011
RILEY:
It won't catch.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.142
Kindling's too damp.

09:38.186 --> 09:41.493
Yep. I once spent
two full days

09:41.537 --> 09:42.930
trying to start a fire.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.279
I'm not kidding.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.020
48 hours straight, two sunsets.

09:46.063 --> 09:47.891
But it was all soaked.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.459
I was convinced
I was gonna freeze to death.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.027
Was this during your Phoenix
wilderness training?

09:53.070 --> 09:55.638
Uh, no, this was a camping trip
with my grandfather.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.466
He used to take me
out here a lot

09:57.509 --> 09:58.641
after my mom died.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.034
He always used to say,

10:00.077 --> 10:01.426
all you need to survive
the wilderness

10:01.470 --> 10:02.906
is what's up here
and what's out there.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.213
Well, you think you can

10:05.256 --> 10:07.302
whip us up a dehumidifier
for this kindling

10:07.345 --> 10:09.217
with what's out there?

10:09.260 --> 10:11.262
No need.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.655
I survived that
camping trip,

10:12.699 --> 10:14.657
obviously,
because I realized

10:14.701 --> 10:16.877
that I was surrounded
by a plant called

10:16.920 --> 10:19.270
Chamaenerion angustifolium.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.315
Chamana-what-a-nana-na?

10:20.358 --> 10:21.621
More commonly known

10:21.664 --> 10:22.796
as fireweed.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.929
It's the perfect tinder
for damp wood.

10:25.973 --> 10:28.497
Just don't put
too much on at once.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.413
Want to give it a second try?

10:31.456 --> 10:33.371
RILEY:
All right.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.506
ALL:
Whoa!

10:37.549 --> 10:39.334
BOZER:
Oh, nice.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.683
All right. Fireweed.Now we just
keep adding

10:40.727 --> 10:42.642
bigger sticks until
the fire is roaring.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.428
Let's see.MacGYVER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:46.471 --> 10:47.385
Boze, put that down.What?

10:47.429 --> 10:48.560
Whoa. Whoa.Why?

10:48.604 --> 10:51.172
Put it down;
not in the fire.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.217
Don't tell me it's endangered.RILEY: No, but you
were about to be.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.219
That's poison oak.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.830
MacGYVER: Yeah, you
don't want to inhale

10:56.873 --> 10:59.528
the burning oils of a
poison oak leaf ever.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.704
Do bad things to your lungs.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.794
12-year-old Angus almost learned
that one the hard way, too.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.275
Sorry, man. Just tired.MacGYVER: It's
been a long day.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.407
I think we can all say that.
But you've done great.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.931
So I figured I'd reward us

11:10.974 --> 11:13.281
with a little gourmet
treat for dinner.BOZER: Yeah.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.325
That's what I'm talking about.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.631
Turn up! Yeah.Starving.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.938
Yeah, yeah. Get some food.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.069
About to get a snack. Yeah.Cattails.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.419
Man, what in the hell?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.073
Oh, man.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.206
Sorry, couldn't help myself.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.338
Here you go.

11:27.382 --> 11:30.298
Hey, d-d-don't.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.443
You were snoring.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.531
Did you have to wake me, though?

11:46.575 --> 11:49.143
I was having the best dream.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.536
I was eating
a tasty T-bone steak

11:51.580 --> 11:54.235
with a side of...Cattails?

11:54.278 --> 11:55.976
Ugh. Hell no.

11:56.019 --> 12:00.023
Seriously, Mac.
Do we have to keep eating these?

12:03.461 --> 12:06.160
Where's Mac?I don't know.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.640
His boots and backpack were
already gone when I woke up.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.469
He left without telling us?

12:11.513 --> 12:13.384
Maybe he went
for an early-morning hike.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.778
Wait. Didn't he say
day two was tracking?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.433
Maybe this is a test and
we're supposed to find him.

12:18.476 --> 12:21.131
"Immersive training
is the best training."

12:21.175 --> 12:24.091
Exactly. So, what's
the first step?Mmm.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.789
Pick up his trail, I guess.All right.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.753
RILEY:
I got some bootprints over here.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.146
Let's see.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.975
These aren't Mac's. Look at the
sole. It's a different shoe.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.977
And it wasn't here
when we made camp.

12:42.022 --> 12:44.676
See?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.591
These are Mac's footprints.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.463
So someone else was here?

12:56.732 --> 12:59.779
This is the same brand we saw
at that campsite yesterday.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.651
And it's got dew all over it,

13:02.694 --> 13:05.785
which means whoever dropped it
must have been here last night.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.917
So that smoker was watching
us while we were sleeping,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.572
and now Mac suddenly vanished?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.444
I'm getting
a really bad feeling.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.416
Keep moving.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.391
Fellas.
Meet our new guide.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.400
You might want
to ration that.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
It's hard to come by
clean water out here.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.273
Where's your food?

13:59.316 --> 14:00.796
I catch and find it on my own.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.365
How long's it been
since you guys ran out?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.889
Too long.Enough chitchat.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.500
Get off your asses and pack
the gear. We're moving out.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.721
Go!

14:20.381 --> 14:22.644
Only gonna say this once,
Ranger Rick.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.298
Don't.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.604
All my friends
run faster than you.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.872
So, are you gonna tell me
what this is all about?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.352
Where do you need
to go so badly

14:35.396 --> 14:37.137
you're willing to kidnap
a guide?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.101
"X" marks the spot.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.799
What's at the "X"?Not your concern.
Just get me there.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.802
Okay, but I don't really know

14:50.846 --> 14:52.979
how to tell you this.
This is on the other side

14:53.022 --> 14:54.415
of some of the roughest
terrain out here.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.504
A trek like this should
only be attempted

14:56.547 --> 14:57.592
by a well-trained crew,
not a bunch of first-timers.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.811
I didn't ask your opinion.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.292
Just get us there, all right?

15:02.336 --> 15:03.511
Getting angry doesn't
change the fact

15:03.554 --> 15:04.816
that you have no
food, no water.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.992
You're inexperienced,

15:06.035 --> 15:08.081
and you're not prepared
for this hike.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.083
I mean, it's about to
rain and...

15:11.649 --> 15:14.696
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

15:14.739 --> 15:19.657
Act as if your life depends
on getting us to that "X."

15:19.701 --> 15:21.921
Because it does.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.666
All right, Jack.
Time to share.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.798
What have you been staring at

15:29.841 --> 15:31.104
since we left Ethan's house?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.410
All right, somebody
sent me this photo earlier,

15:33.454 --> 15:35.586
but I didn't want
to bother you with it,

15:35.630 --> 15:36.718
given the circumstances.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.589
You have no idea who
sent this to you?

15:38.633 --> 15:39.677
No.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.027
And they won't
return my texts.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.680
I can't figure out who that is.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.074
Send it to our lab.
Have it analyzed.Yeah, all right.

15:49.731 --> 15:53.039
Hey, will you do me a favor
and go grab us some snacks?

15:54.083 --> 15:56.912
Sure.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.046
Ethan.Jack.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.439
How are Deena and Mara doing?

16:02.483 --> 16:06.052
Confused. Scared. Angry.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.967
About as good as
can be expected.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.839
So, how did S-Company find us?You know I can't
tell you that.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.797
You're serious?

16:12.841 --> 16:14.495
You remember that I had

16:14.538 --> 16:15.583
a higher clearance
than you, right?

16:15.626 --> 16:16.627
Now you don't.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.020
Ethan, you're out.

16:18.064 --> 16:21.502
So, as awkward
and complicated as this is,

16:21.545 --> 16:23.504
I need to treat you
like any other civilian

16:23.547 --> 16:26.855
going into witness protection.Except I'm not like any
other civilian, Matty.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.204
Because if I were,

16:28.248 --> 16:29.771
then the director of a
top secret intel agency

16:29.814 --> 16:32.513
would not be personally handling
my relocation assignment.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.559
You're right.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.823
Our situation is unique.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.912
But the fact that
we were married

16:40.956 --> 16:43.480
doesn't mean that I can just
throw out U.S. government...

16:43.524 --> 16:46.831
Deena...You were married?

16:48.833 --> 16:51.097
JACK:
No jalapeño
beef jerky.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.316
You know, they got every
flavor under the sun,

16:53.360 --> 16:54.622
and no jalapeño.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.800
That is definitely going
on my Yelp... review.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.979
We should probably hit the road.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.857
MacGYVER: You know,
we should really stop

17:12.901 --> 17:14.729
and build a fire
to dry those clothes out

17:14.772 --> 17:15.773
before you all become
hypothermic.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.906
Just keep moving.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.221
What's the holdup?Well, we need a new route,

17:28.264 --> 17:29.396
'cause this one's too dangerous.

17:29.439 --> 17:30.919
Looks fine to me.Right.

17:30.962 --> 17:32.921
But what you can't see is
the invisible layer of moisture

17:32.964 --> 17:34.792
left over by the rain
on the rocks is now frozen

17:34.836 --> 17:36.620
into an invisible sheet of ice.

17:36.664 --> 17:38.535
So, crossing these boulders
is a risk we can easily avoid

17:38.579 --> 17:39.536
by going another way.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.103
Will that take longer?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.149
Well, yeah, a little bit.Then no,

17:43.192 --> 17:46.587
we're not going out of our way
to avoid a few slippery rocks.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.547
Okay, there's a way
to make this safer,

17:50.591 --> 17:51.809
but I'm gonna need my knife

17:51.853 --> 17:54.682
and all the zippers
from the tents.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.774
All right.You sure?

17:59.817 --> 18:02.211
What's he gonna do
with this toy?

18:06.911 --> 18:11.438
All right, these should give
your boots extra traction.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.702
But it's still dangerous,
so take small steps.

18:14.745 --> 18:17.661
But really, you should
follow my exact footing.

18:17.705 --> 18:18.793
After you.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.757
MacGYVER:
Hey, I told you to follow me.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.023
Uh...

18:35.592 --> 18:37.246
MacGYVER: Hurts?Yeah.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.813
We gotta stop for the night.No chance.

18:38.856 --> 18:39.857
Look, you don't
have a choice.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.772
He sprained his ankle.
It's bad.

18:41.816 --> 18:44.035
I've got to control the swelling
or it's gonna get worse,

18:44.079 --> 18:45.863
and that means elevating it
for a few hours.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.604
I'll go look for something
to make a splint,

18:47.648 --> 18:48.866
stabilize his leg.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.781
And then I'll make a
crutch so you can walk.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.914
But from here on out,
it's gonna be slow going.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.307
Go with him.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.962
Gio, I'm sorry, man.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.225
Take it easy, Cid.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.575
Relax.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.192
Okay, that was a gunshot,

19:10.236 --> 19:11.715
and it's definitely coming
from that way.

19:11.759 --> 19:12.803
Come on, we gotta move.Wait, wait, wait.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.022
What are we gonna do

19:14.065 --> 19:15.502
when we catch up with
these guys?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.199
They have guns.I guess we gotta improvise.
Come on.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.907
What did you do?

19:29.951 --> 19:32.258
You said he was
gonna slow us down.

19:37.741 --> 19:40.048
Well, my friends will
have heard that shot.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.224
If you want to keep them out
of this, I suggest

19:42.268 --> 19:43.225
you pick up the pace.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.637
Get moving.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.397
JACK:
Louisiana.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.877
Texas. Yee-haw.
Way to go, Texas.

20:26.921 --> 20:28.749
Kansas.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.185
Everybody, we got a Kan...

20:30.229 --> 20:32.796
Jack, please stop.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.755
You're the only one playing.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.757
: Just trying to
lighten the mood in here.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.758
It's like a hearst.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.107
Hearse.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.805
Yeah, that's what
I said. Hearst.

20:41.849 --> 20:45.287
This part of Nebraska we're
going to is really beautiful.

20:45.331 --> 20:48.508
It's full of rolling hills
and tranquil streams.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.596
You're gonna love it.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.859
Mara will, too.

20:51.902 --> 20:54.992
We're gonna have a
beautiful life there.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.136
How much farther?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.399
Two miles, as the crow flies,

21:10.443 --> 21:11.618
but it's gonna be
a one-way trip

21:11.661 --> 21:13.141
if we don't stop
to collect water.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.403
When we get there.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.624
And if our muscles cramp
from dehydration

21:17.667 --> 21:19.756
before we get there,
you gonna shoot everybody?

21:24.718 --> 21:26.154
Look,

21:26.197 --> 21:29.549
you can send your people
down here to this stream

21:29.592 --> 21:30.854
to collect the water.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.769
But don't drink it yet.
It's not potable.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.902
And you're gonna make it
drinkable? How?

21:34.945 --> 21:37.905
I just need my knife, a
pine tree branch, and...

21:39.820 --> 21:41.865
...one of these
sleeping bag stuff sacks.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.003
All right. You heard him.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.570
Fill up every
bottle we got.

21:50.613 --> 21:51.962
Get to it.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.270
MacGYVER: Access to
clean drinking water is vital

21:55.314 --> 21:57.185
in wilderness survival.

21:57.228 --> 21:59.013
Without it, your body
will break down rapidly.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.408
So when dirty water
is the only thing on the menu,

22:02.451 --> 22:06.063
you have to turn to Mother Nature for some help.

22:07.021 --> 22:09.589
Are you sure it's safe?

22:10.633 --> 22:12.200
Absolutely.

22:12.243 --> 22:16.857
The xylem in the pine branches
pulls out any harmful bacteria.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.381
Trees don't like drinking dirty
water any more than people do.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.430
How long have you known Gio?

22:24.473 --> 22:25.866
A few years.

22:25.909 --> 22:28.651
Longer than that guy
he just shot back there?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.088
No.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.569
Gio and Cid go way back.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.179
Why do you ask?

22:35.223 --> 22:37.617
If Gio was willing to shoot
that guy he's known for years

22:37.660 --> 22:40.054
over possibly slowing him down
a little,

22:40.097 --> 22:42.491
what do you think
he's gonna be doing to you

22:42.535 --> 22:45.015
when he finds out
he doesn't need you anymore?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.542
Wow.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.761
You are too cute.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.589
Hey, Giovanni.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.853
Your human GPS is trying
to get me to turn on you.

22:56.897 --> 22:58.289
GIOVANNI:
Really?

22:58.333 --> 22:59.900
Did it work?

22:59.943 --> 23:02.032
Ask me to pull
the trigger,

23:02.076 --> 23:03.904
and I'll happily
prove my loyalty.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.994
Tempting, but not now.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.125
We still need him.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.432
Can't say I blame you
for trying, kid.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.434
Punishment,
however, will have

23:12.478 --> 23:13.435
to wait for later.

23:13.479 --> 23:14.567
If your water's finally done,

23:14.610 --> 23:15.568
let's get moving.

23:15.611 --> 23:18.353
Come on.
Pack up.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.877
RILEY:
Hey, I got more blood over here.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.717
Man, I really thought that
was gonna be Mac down there.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.240
Yeah, me, too.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.634
But if they did that
to one of their own...

23:38.678 --> 23:39.983
It's only a matter
of time before

23:40.027 --> 23:41.637
the next body we find is Mac.

23:41.681 --> 23:43.378
Bozer, look.
He's still got a radio on him.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.945
If we can get it, I think I can

23:44.988 --> 23:46.250
contact a park ranger.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.078
Love the plan, Riley.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.124
There's just a teeny-tiny,

23:50.167 --> 23:52.082
50-foot problem.

23:52.126 --> 23:55.042
Mac taught us to weave rope
for building our shelter.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.304
What if...

23:56.347 --> 23:58.480
what if we just build
a really long rope?

23:58.524 --> 24:00.308
Strong enough to climb down?

24:00.351 --> 24:02.136
No, no. Rope's not for climbing.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.007
It's for fishing.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.620
BOZER :
Now, that is a hook.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.491
Easy. Easy.

24:11.101 --> 24:12.538
Slow, slow, slow.I got it.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.325
Whew.

24:22.112 --> 24:23.070
What's wrong?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.767
This is a consumer radio.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.248
It doesn't tune to the frequency
the National Park Service uses.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.772
Isn't there, like, a... an
emergency channel or something?

24:29.816 --> 24:31.121
Yeah. Of course.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.514
But there's no guarantee
anyone's gonna hear it.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.168
We could sit here all
day calling for help.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.563
So we did all that
for nothing?

24:37.606 --> 24:38.912
Man.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.175
Actually, no.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.742
I might be able to tune it

24:42.785 --> 24:44.483
to the authorized
federal government band.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.745
Do that.I'm gonna try.

24:52.447 --> 24:53.404
Well?

24:53.448 --> 24:54.797
Yeah, we are, uh...

24:54.841 --> 24:55.842
we're here.

24:55.885 --> 24:57.365
Spread out.
Find it!

25:06.113 --> 25:08.115
Gio, there's nothing here!

25:11.727 --> 25:13.599
You led us to the wrong place.I did not.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.296
Look, the geographical
location-- this is ex...

25:15.339 --> 25:16.776
GIOVANNI: Yeah, yeah,
either you screwed up,

25:16.819 --> 25:18.473
or you're playing games.I didn't, and I'm not.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.259
I don't believe you.

25:22.303 --> 25:25.088
Wait. Wait.

25:25.132 --> 25:30.050
Is what you're looking for
nailed to the ground?

25:30.093 --> 25:31.442
What kind of question is that?

25:31.486 --> 25:32.835
'Cause if it wasn't,
it's possible

25:32.879 --> 25:34.315
that a flash flood took it away.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.056
Explain.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.145
See the dried mud
on the rocks right there.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.668
It's a waterline,
and it's a recent one.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.235
If you tell me the
size and the weight

25:41.278 --> 25:43.106
of what you're looking for,
I may be able to determine

25:43.150 --> 25:45.456
where the flood took it.

25:48.285 --> 25:50.505
I'm looking for
$18 million.

25:52.986 --> 25:54.161
All right.

25:55.728 --> 25:56.772
How'd it get out here?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.426
I pushed it out a plane.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.211
All right.

26:01.255 --> 26:04.388
All right, well, what was
the denomination of bills?

26:04.432 --> 26:05.868
How does that possibly matter?

26:05.912 --> 26:08.436
You want to find it or not?The cash was in hundreds.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.612
So that means it was
about 400 pounds.

26:10.656 --> 26:12.571
What was it in?Wooden crate.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.095
The kind banks use to
ship money to each other

26:15.138 --> 26:16.836
when they're balancing
the ledgers.

26:16.879 --> 26:19.273
Okay, so you guys stole
this crate, you loaded it

26:19.316 --> 26:21.362
onto a plane, and then you
pushed it out mid-flight.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.146
I'm guessing that the
cops were onto you?

26:23.190 --> 26:24.321
Something like that.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.193
It was too hot to
land with the cash,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.977
so we pushed it out and marked
the location on the map,

26:28.021 --> 26:28.978
and the rest you know.

26:29.022 --> 26:32.242
Now, where is my money?

26:33.592 --> 26:35.245
Getting pretty sick
of asking you.

26:35.289 --> 26:36.507
Okay, look,

26:36.551 --> 26:39.598
I can... I can use
the erosion rate of the soil

26:39.641 --> 26:42.644
to determine the speed
of the flash flood's water.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.168
Then I can solve
for direction and distance

26:45.212 --> 26:47.257
traveled by the crate,
as long as I can figure out

26:47.301 --> 26:48.476
the missing variable here.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.260
And that is?

26:50.304 --> 26:51.653
It's the, uh, angle
of the slope of the ground

26:51.697 --> 26:52.872
we're standing on right now.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.134
GIOVANNI: This ground's
completely flat.

26:54.177 --> 26:56.092
To the naked eye it is.

26:56.136 --> 26:57.354
Can I borrow your scope?

27:02.316 --> 27:03.926
Give it to him.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.204
Take it just beyond that rock.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.997
Okay.
The greatest angle of the slope

27:31.040 --> 27:33.173
is 18 degrees northeast.

27:33.216 --> 27:38.091
And we are looking at...
crate, let's say 430 pounds,

27:38.134 --> 27:39.875
made of porous wood,
filled with cash.

27:39.919 --> 27:42.922
So if I can calculate
the flood time

27:42.965 --> 27:45.881
and water speed
using the erosion rate,

27:45.925 --> 27:49.058
then that means the crate
would've floated

27:49.102 --> 27:51.104
about right there.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.235
You better be right.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.502
Hey.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.331
Is making my ears bleed
part of the process?

28:01.375 --> 28:03.203
Nope. That's just a fun bonus.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.726
I'm turning the copper wire
to bypass

28:04.770 --> 28:05.988
all commercial frequencies

28:06.032 --> 28:07.468
so we can reach

28:07.511 --> 28:10.297
the restricted
government channels.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.480
Help. Help.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.874
We need help. Does anybody copy?

28:21.917 --> 28:23.658
Maybe we're out of range?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.529
I'm trying to reach
Washington Park Service.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.097
Does anybody copy?
We need help.

28:28.141 --> 28:31.144
Uh, this is the park ranger.
Who is this?

28:31.187 --> 28:33.233
This is Riley Davis.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.365
My friends and I were
hiking in Walker Gorge

28:35.409 --> 28:36.802
when armed men
kidnapped one of us.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.629
We need immediate assistance.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.241
Uh, copy that.
Do you know your location?

28:41.284 --> 28:43.852
Uh, we're on a cliff?

28:43.896 --> 28:46.507
Where the kidnappers
killed one of their own.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.379
I see a mountain range
to the south.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.252
The gorge is maybe
20 miles east.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.167
Copy. I think
I know where you're at.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.386
We're contacting
law enforcement now.

28:56.430 --> 29:00.042
Uh, stay where you are,
keep your radio on...

29:01.087 --> 29:03.089
Help is on the way.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.442
And you said swinging
by the ranger station

29:08.485 --> 29:10.009
was gonna be a waste of time.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.358
Anton.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.360
Backtrack,
find his buddies.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.928
Keep them company.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.973
Wait for my signal.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.295
Think that's enough smoke
to draw the rangers?

29:36.687 --> 29:38.298
BOZER:
I guess the answer is yes.

29:42.955 --> 29:43.869
You guys call
an emergency?

29:43.912 --> 29:45.740
RILEY:
We did, but...

29:45.784 --> 29:46.828
we were expecting a park ranger.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.961
Sadly, they're
not gonna make it.

29:49.004 --> 29:51.659
Now toss me a radio
and shut up.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.928
Gio, Emma.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.538
EMMA: It's Emma.
You found his friends?

30:01.582 --> 30:03.062
Yeah, sure did.
We're getting acquainted now.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.541
Good.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.630
We're almost to the
money. Keep them alive.

30:06.674 --> 30:07.893
We'll tell you
if that needs to change.

30:14.769 --> 30:17.554
Pretty cold out here, huh?What part of "shut up"
was confusing?

30:17.598 --> 30:19.513
Just saying, sun's going
down, temperature, too.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.081
If your cotton clothes are
as damp as they look...

30:22.124 --> 30:23.647
But hey, I'm sure a
guy like you knows

30:23.691 --> 30:25.040
how to deal with
hypothermia.

30:25.084 --> 30:27.608
And if I don't?

30:27.651 --> 30:28.783
We need to build
up this fire.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.437
If we use some
branches and leaves

30:30.480 --> 30:31.917
from that bush over there,
it'll keep us all warm

30:31.960 --> 30:34.745
until our current situation
gets resolved.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.880
Fine, but stay
where I can see you.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.577
All right.

31:00.467 --> 31:02.251
Good job, Bozer.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.210
You officially know
what poison oak looks like.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.865
Now, where's our friend?

31:08.518 --> 31:10.869
MacGYVER: This ravine acts
as a natural drainage basin

31:10.912 --> 31:13.784
for anything displaced
by the flood.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.831
So your crate
should be here.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.008
There. There!

31:36.677 --> 31:38.592
It's all here.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.551
GIOVANNI: Yeah, well, we
can celebrate when we get

31:41.595 --> 31:43.597
the money back to the car.TREVOR: It'll be tough.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.599
We only have three backpacks,
and we're a man down.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.340
EMMA: On the bright side,
18 million split four ways

31:47.383 --> 31:48.515
is much better.

31:49.995 --> 31:53.607
Okay. I did what you asked.
I got you to your money.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.175
Now call your man and tell
him to let my friends go.

31:56.218 --> 31:58.003
If I said I was gonna
kill your friends

31:58.046 --> 32:00.701
if you didn't think of a way
to get all this money back

32:00.744 --> 32:03.573
by yourself, what would you say?I'd say that wasn't
part of the deal.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.967
Yeah, well, I'm making it
the deal. Answer me.

32:06.011 --> 32:09.318
Can you build something to make
moving my money a one-man job?

32:15.672 --> 32:16.935
Sure?Yeah.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.588
Why?
All right.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.858
Do it, then.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.773
We'll move it all
as soon as you're ready.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
All clear.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.764
Welcome home.

33:15.384 --> 33:17.734
Okay.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.433
This is, uh... this is all
the stuff they brought.

33:20.476 --> 33:21.912
And Ethan is

33:21.956 --> 33:23.784
doing another sweep
of the neighborhood

33:23.827 --> 33:25.916
just to... just to be safe.

33:28.702 --> 33:29.920
How you holding up?

33:29.964 --> 33:31.748
It's her I'm worried about.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.489
JACK:
Yeah, well,

33:33.533 --> 33:34.577
rough day.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.231
I want to talk to her,

33:36.275 --> 33:38.016
put her mind at ease, but...

33:38.059 --> 33:39.887
I have no idea what to say.

33:39.930 --> 33:41.758
Sure, you do.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.631
You only think you don't know
what to say 'cause you're so...

33:44.674 --> 33:47.025
involved.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.809
Imagine if the roles
were reversed

33:48.852 --> 33:50.506
and I was unsure
how to handle this.

33:50.550 --> 33:51.986
What would you tell me to do?

33:52.030 --> 33:54.380
I would say, "Tell her
the truth about your past

33:54.423 --> 33:56.034
so she's not guessing."

33:56.077 --> 33:58.036
Ta-da.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.864
You got this.

34:02.562 --> 34:05.826
MARA:
Mommy, I need purple.

34:08.872 --> 34:11.614
It's not here, sweetie.

34:11.658 --> 34:12.920
But I need it now!

34:12.963 --> 34:15.923
You know what, Mara?

34:15.966 --> 34:19.318
You can make
your own purple. Look.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.884
MARA:
Mm-hmm.

34:20.928 --> 34:24.584
All you need is red...

34:26.716 --> 34:29.719
...and blue.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.548
See? Purple.
You want to try?
Mm.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.856
Thank you.

34:40.165 --> 34:42.123
Giving up everything
you've ever known.

34:43.385 --> 34:46.388
Having to start
over again twice.

34:46.432 --> 34:48.608
I can't imagine how hard
this has been for you.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.741
But what I can
imagine is that

34:51.785 --> 34:53.830
you would like to
start your new life

34:53.874 --> 34:55.267
without any questions,

34:55.310 --> 34:57.791
which is why I think
you should know the truth.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.664
Ethan and I were married,

35:01.708 --> 35:04.145
and we loved each
other very much,

35:04.189 --> 35:06.365
but that was
a lifetime ago,

35:06.408 --> 35:08.584
before you and he ever met.

35:08.628 --> 35:11.239
Now you and Mara
are his life.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.546
And as soon as we're sure
that you're safe here,

35:13.589 --> 35:15.243
you'll never see me again.

35:19.813 --> 35:22.685
All I want is
to give Mara a good life.

35:22.729 --> 35:25.514
And you will.

35:28.517 --> 35:29.692
For you.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.085
This is for me?

35:32.521 --> 35:34.784
It's beautiful.

35:34.828 --> 35:37.700
Thank you.You're welcome.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.006
ETHAN:
Yeah, no, I feel
the same way.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.230
Good in here?

35:47.188 --> 35:49.582
Yeah, we're good.

36:00.984 --> 36:04.858
How much longer is your
sled thing gonna take?

36:04.901 --> 36:06.990
Not much longer.
Just one more thing.

36:12.648 --> 36:15.564
My money!

36:21.788 --> 36:23.137
That's got to
be Mac, right?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.921
Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.796
Don't stop. Keep going.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.100
Mac!
Mac! Mac!

37:13.143 --> 37:15.233
Mac! Mac.

37:15.276 --> 37:18.888
He's been shot.
He's still alive.

37:18.932 --> 37:19.454
Mac.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.588
Mac! Hey. Hey.

37:23.415 --> 37:24.633
You guys are okay?

37:24.677 --> 37:25.808
It's not us we're worried about.
Okay?

37:25.852 --> 37:26.940
You got a bullet
in your leg.

37:26.983 --> 37:28.376
You need to tell us how
to take it out.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.725
You don't.

37:29.769 --> 37:32.902
You just stop the bleeding
and dress the wound.

37:32.946 --> 37:33.903
What do we dress the wound with?

37:33.947 --> 37:36.166
Yarrow.
Yarrow?

37:36.210 --> 37:37.429
It's a white flower.
Grows in clusters.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.169
Should be all around here.

37:39.213 --> 37:42.477
All right, buddy, you're gonna
have to put pressure on it.

37:42.521 --> 37:43.957
Too much?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.480
Oh, no, not enough.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.743
Yep, that's it. More like it.

37:49.963 --> 37:52.008
Okay...

37:52.052 --> 37:56.012
All right, now, pack the wound
and wrap it tight.

38:00.713 --> 38:02.671
You ready?
Yeah.

38:06.022 --> 38:08.242
Okay. Yep.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.417
Tighter. We're gonna have
to do it tighter.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.245
We gotta tie it.
You see any vines?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.508
I've got something better.

38:15.075 --> 38:16.381
Here. This is stronger.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.208
Yeah, that'll work.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.693
BOZER:
Sorry, Mac.That's okay. That'll do.

38:24.737 --> 38:27.217
Okay.Now the hard part.

38:27.261 --> 38:30.003
Get me to a hospital.

38:30.046 --> 38:31.570
Take his legs.
We gotta carry him.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.354
It's too far; we'll never make
it out of the woods in time.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.095
So what are we gonna do?

38:36.662 --> 38:38.316
RILEY: Looks like Mac was
building a sled.

38:38.359 --> 38:40.100
We can finish it and use it
to drag him out.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.365
Everything you need's in there:
new names,

38:44.409 --> 38:47.455
new Social Security numbers,
new marriage certificate.

38:47.499 --> 38:48.456
The works.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.457
Hope it helps.

38:49.501 --> 38:52.634
Take care of
yourself, Ethan.

38:52.678 --> 38:54.288
Thanks, Jack.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.855
I really appreciate it.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.335
Yeah. You're welcome.

39:03.471 --> 39:04.516
Thanks, Matty.

39:04.559 --> 39:05.821
For saving my family
in Cypress,

39:05.865 --> 39:09.085
for moving us here, for...

39:09.129 --> 39:11.349
for everything.

39:11.392 --> 39:12.828
Sorry you had to relive this.

39:12.872 --> 39:16.397
The truth is I chose
to do this myself

39:16.441 --> 39:19.400
because I thought watching you
move into your new home

39:19.444 --> 39:22.229
with your new family
would crush me.

39:22.272 --> 39:25.363
And the pain would bring me
the closure I need.

39:26.886 --> 39:27.843
Wow.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.454
Yeah.

39:29.497 --> 39:30.933
So, did it?

39:30.977 --> 39:34.154
Not how I expected.

39:34.197 --> 39:37.331
Because now that I'm here,
I'm not feeling any pain,

39:37.375 --> 39:41.901
just a strong desire for you
and your family to be happy.

39:44.817 --> 39:47.167
Well, that means
the world to me.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.431
I don't think I could have
done any of this

39:50.475 --> 39:51.998
if I hadn't heard you say that.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.000
You know, after this,
there can be no more contact

39:54.043 --> 39:55.567
with your former life.

39:55.610 --> 39:57.569
Including you.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.875
Especially me.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.008
This is goodbye, Ethan.

40:03.749 --> 40:04.750
Bye, Matty.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.603
Sometimes...

40:31.646 --> 40:34.954
life doesn't work out the way
we think it will, huh, Matty?

40:34.997 --> 40:37.609
No, it sure doesn't.

40:37.652 --> 40:40.568
Ethan and I had some
wonderful years together.

40:40.612 --> 40:44.093
But this is where
he's supposed to be.

40:44.137 --> 40:46.792
And I'm where
I'm supposed to be.

40:48.489 --> 40:51.318
Sitting with my lame ass in an
SUV that smells like beef jerky

40:51.361 --> 40:53.451
in rural Nebraska?

40:53.494 --> 40:55.627
Huh? Is that where
you're supposed to be?

40:56.671 --> 40:58.456
You've always had

40:58.499 --> 41:01.067
a very special way
with words, Jack.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.460
Oh, thank you.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.505
What do you say we get
out of here, boss lady?

41:04.549 --> 41:05.724
Sounds like a plan.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.247
Yeah, let's go.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.214
Are those the lab results?

41:21.174 --> 41:22.392
Yeah.

41:22.436 --> 41:24.656
They didn't I.D.
who sent the photo,

41:24.699 --> 41:26.701
but they sure figured out
who was in it.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.835
Tiberius Kovacs?Tiberius Kovacs.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.358
The one and only.Weren't you on the team

41:31.401 --> 41:33.665
that took him out ten years ago?

41:33.708 --> 41:35.884
I pulled the trigger.

41:37.886 --> 41:39.758
Why is someone sending you
a decade-old photo

41:39.801 --> 41:41.281
of a dead terrorist?

41:41.324 --> 41:43.196
I don't know.

41:44.806 --> 41:47.635
But I got a bad feeling
about it.

41:55.817 --> 41:57.166
Fred!Fred!

41:57.210 --> 41:58.951
We need your cell phone
right now.

42:02.563 --> 42:04.086
It's gonna be okay.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.616
Thanks.

42:11.659 --> 42:12.791
BOZER:
Matty, it's Bozer.

42:12.834 --> 42:15.402
Listen, Mac needs
a medevac ASAP.

42:15.445 --> 42:17.099
What happened?

42:17.143 --> 42:18.927
We're at a gas station
20 miles from Walker Gorge.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.668
My friends... saved me.

42:20.712 --> 42:22.496
Riley, Bozer...

42:23.671 --> 42:26.892
...you passed.
