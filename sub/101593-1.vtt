[boy narrating]
Wanna know a little secret?

00:27.193 --> 00:29.612
Most teenagers out there
feel like they're invincible.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.324
Not the Superman kind of invincible.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.577
The kind of invincible
that tricks you into thinking

00:35.660 --> 00:38.371
tomorrow might be a better day
to start chasing your dreams.

00:39.664 --> 00:44.002
Or, like you have an extra ten minutes
to get somewhere when, clearly, you don't.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.088
-[mom] Okay. Front door service.
-[boy] Thanks, Mom. I owe you.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
[mom chuckles] I'll put it on your tab.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.593
-[boy] Hey, could you grab my crutches?
-Yep. Got 'em.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.221
-Have fun up there, okay?
-[boy] All right.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.265
-Thank you.
-[mom] There you go.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.184
-Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
-[boy] It's okay. Leave it!

00:59.267 --> 01:02.354
[mom] Okay. Go, go, go.
I'll see you in a minute. Have fun.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.189
-[male student] 'Sup, Zach?
-Hey.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.316
[Zach narrating]
The truth is that even after four years

01:06.399 --> 01:08.526
and, like, 20-something rounds of chemo...

01:09.652 --> 01:10.945
I'm still figuring it out.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.823
[MC] Thank you.
Thank you means leave. Stick to football.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.408
-Hi, Zach.
-Hey, Mr. Reed.

01:15.492 --> 01:16.368
[whooping, clapping]

01:16.451 --> 01:18.870
[MC] I don't wanna see
some of y'all in a skirt again.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.663
Don't clap for them. Don't do that.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.749
Sorry about that. You know
that was uncomfortable to watch.

01:22.832 --> 01:23.833
They didn't rehearse.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.919
Let's give it up for some students
that actually rehearsed

01:26.002 --> 01:27.003
to put on a show for us.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.881
Give it up for
the Stillwater High Topaz Dance Crew!

01:29.964 --> 01:32.133
-[whistling, clapping]
-[song playing]

01:32.217 --> 01:34.678
[Zach] And while there's a lot
that I don't know at my age,

01:34.761 --> 01:36.262
what I do know is this:

01:37.138 --> 01:41.142
What some people take for granted,
others are fighting for.

01:42.102 --> 01:45.105
And believe me, I'm a fighter.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.191
[song continues]

01:51.903 --> 01:52.904
[Zach grunts]

01:56.700 --> 01:58.284
-Zach?
-Hello.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.369
Where have you been?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.246
You know I like to make a big entrance.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.167
-You okay?
-Yeah. I'm gonna throw up.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.003
We've been through this. Just breathe.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.550
I know. I know. It's just everyone--

02:14.551 --> 02:16.177
Everybody's killing it out there.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.680
Look at Amy. She doesn't even have to try.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.599
She was born graceful.
I was born to fall on my face.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.563
[Zach chuckles]

02:26.646 --> 02:27.939
You are painfully awkward.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.401
Shut up. Sammy. Hey.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862
You sang it for me, and it was awesome.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.240
[scoffs] That's nice,
but you are my best friend,

02:37.323 --> 02:39.701
so you are morally obligated
to say nice things to me.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.870
Everybody else out there
is not my best friend.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.789
If everyone else doesn't like it,
then they're idiots.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
Sorry.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.835
-Just don't screw it up, all right?
-Ha, that's not funny.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.963
[Sammy exhales]

02:52.922 --> 02:55.091
God, this stage fright thing is so stupid.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.343
It's not stupid.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.681
Look, if you're not ready to go,
then I will.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.601
-[song ends]
-[audience applauding]

03:05.185 --> 03:07.395
-You will?
-Yes.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.523
[MC] That's right. Keep it going.
Come on. Let me hear y'all.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.608
All right.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.528
-Knock 'em dead, good sir.
-You'll get 'em next time.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.238
[MC] I'm not gonna hold you guys...

03:17.322 --> 03:19.574
Hey, hey. Awesome performance.

03:19.657 --> 03:23.328
Really liked that leg flippy dippy
spin move you did. Great form.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.123
Well, I really liked that flippy dippy
thumbs-up thing you did.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.208
That was cute.

03:28.291 --> 03:32.087
[MC] Give it up for Sammy Brown,
everybody! Sammy Brown!

03:32.170 --> 03:35.632
[scattered clapping, whispering]

03:35.840 --> 03:36.883
Mr. Weaver.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.969
-[microphone feedback]
-[sighs]

03:41.721 --> 03:44.849
Hello, Stillwater. Whoo!

03:44.933 --> 03:46.685
[clapping, whistling]

03:46.768 --> 03:48.728
Thank you. Thank you.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.146
Okay, so, um...

03:50.814 --> 03:52.816
I know I can easily be mistaken
for Sammy Brown.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.150
[audience chuckles]

03:54.234 --> 03:56.194
But those of you
who are paying attention...

03:57.153 --> 04:00.699
um, may notice that
she has slightly more hair than me.

04:00.782 --> 04:01.908
[audience laughs]

04:02.200 --> 04:04.869
Actually, pretty much everyone
in this school has more hair than me,

04:04.953 --> 04:06.788
now that I think about it.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.415
-Even Mr. Weaver.
-Okay.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.250
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha!

04:10.333 --> 04:12.085
That's funny that he would crack that joke

04:12.168 --> 04:14.587
'cause I actually volunteered
to shave my head off for you.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.089
So you shouldn't be talking about me.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.717
And I'm not gonna lie to y'all.
I won't do that for nobody else.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.011
I'm not getting paid for this.
Just play your song.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.554
Yeah, I'm special.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.978
[male student] Yeah, Sammy!

-Mm-hmm.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.107
Gotta say, interesting song choice.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.863
"Interesting" is an interesting word
to describe someone's music, but okay.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.198
Well, it wasn't really your music.

06:48.575 --> 06:53.580
-Mom, it was fun.
-Oh. Fun is great. I love fun.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.041
-[Zach] You love it?
-Love it.

06:56.124 --> 07:00.128
-Love fun. You're a cool mom.
-I am. Thank you.

07:03.298 --> 07:07.344
So I found some of your lyrics
when I was cleaning your room.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.349
-And you read them?
-They weren't hidden or anything.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.018
They were definitely in my desk drawer.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.895
Which I have to open
to put your stuff away.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.856
Anyway, the point is...
I really like them.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.819
Cool. I'm glad you enjoyed them.
It was seriously nothing.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.112
I was just bored.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.156
Not trying to be Ed Sheeran or anything.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.618
"Ed" who?
Oh, is he that little redheaded fella?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.454
-You're hopeless.
-[laughs]

07:34.537 --> 07:37.207
Anyway, I'm just glad
you're not trying to be Ed or anyone else.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.668
The world already has them.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.713
What would be great is
if it had more of you. Just saying.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.341
I can clean my own room.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.135
Can I get that in writing?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.475
[girl] Hey, dork.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.105
Woo boo boop.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.607
Really? Okay, you're not even watching it.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.317
Oh, yeah, that is true,

08:04.401 --> 08:07.862
but, I mean, if you really want to,
you could just say the magic words.

08:07.946 --> 08:08.947
You're so annoying.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.074
[imitates buzzer]
Those are not the magic words.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.034
Come on. You know 'em.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.662
I... love...

08:16.621 --> 08:17.622
Okay, whatever.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.380
-Aw, is that your girlfriend?
-Stop!

08:25.463 --> 08:27.590
-Out! Out!
-What? She's really pretty.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.635
Does she like your bald head?
That's really nice.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.015

09:17.724 --> 09:20.935
[Sammy] A picnic? It's getting
kinda cold out for a picnic.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.271
[Zach] I know. Okay? I panicked.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.441
[Sammy] I mean, you gotta give it to
a girl that knows what she wants.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.110
I still don't understand why she'd
wanna go out with me in the first place.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.738
Are you serious?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.660
[gasps] You're bald.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.787
Among other things.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.665
Well, hair grows, first of all.
And she knows you beat it last time.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.793
This round of chemo
is basically just a formality.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.544
Yeah. [exhales]

09:49.005 --> 09:51.299
Wait. How does she know that?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.928
Oh, she, like--
She, like, messaged me or whatever.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.098
Just making sure that it was fine
that you guys hung out, I guess.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.182
Why wouldn't it be?

09:59.265 --> 10:02.977
She's probably just trying to be nice
'cause she knows that we hang out a lot.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.981
Okay, well, you told her
that we're basically like family, right?

10:07.065 --> 10:10.485
We've had our diapers changed together.
You've wiped your boogers on me.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.321
I haven't done that in, like, weeks.
So I'ma need you to calm down.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.698
-Feels like yesterday.
-Well,

10:14.781 --> 10:17.826
I lied and I told her that
you're super cool, so you're welcome.

10:18.326 --> 10:21.162
Anyway, I wrote a song.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.539
Okay. Can I hear it?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.750
What? Like right now?

10:25.834 --> 10:26.960
Yeah.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.547
Okay. [chuckles]

10:31.840 --> 10:35.343
-What's it called?
-It's called "Blueberries."

10:37.220 --> 10:39.597
You can't judge it.
You haven't heard it yet.

10:39.681 --> 10:40.682
I feel you judging it.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.394
It's an interesting choice
to write a song about produce is all.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.062
[both chuckle]

10:46.146 --> 10:48.565
Okay, folks.

Just don't judge. It's, like, rough,
but I-- Okay, let's try it.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.285
Don't they feed you in college?

12:24.369 --> 12:26.121
You've done nothing
but mooch since you got home.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.039
I do not mooch, I scavenge.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.749
[dad laughs] You're all vultures.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.584
And as king of the castle,

12:31.668 --> 12:34.963
I claim dibs on all leftovers
henceforth and hereto with.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.174
It should be illegal to make people work
on a day as glorious as this.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.928
-He's got a date.
-Oh. Nice.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.305
-Yeah.
-Hey, your highness, don't forget Daisy.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.726
-Oh, yes. Goodbye, trusty hound.
-[Zach coughs]

12:47.809 --> 12:50.687
-Rob, you're taking her to the groomer.
-You didn't ask me to do that.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.398
Uh, yes, I did. On Tuesday
when I made the appointment.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.191
-I asked you if you were free.
-[Zach coughs]

12:55.275 --> 12:57.027
No, sorry. It's not on the calendar.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.779
I'm gonna take Grace to practice,
and then I'm going straight to work.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.949
Well, I'm taking Zach to his date
and then picking up his meds.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.285
I would take Daisy,
but if I don't hit the road right now,

13:05.368 --> 13:07.579
-I'm not gonna make it to school in time.
-What about Alli?

13:07.662 --> 13:09.372
I can't. I'm waiting on a call from Colin.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.874
-Sam!
-[Zach coughs]

13:10.957 --> 13:12.167
You can't talk in the car?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.669
-I can't FaceTime in the car.
-[Zach coughing]

13:14.753 --> 13:17.464
I haven't seen him in weeks. The base
is super strict on guys in training.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.507
I don't like the sound of that cough.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.134
-[Rob] Grace, let's go.
-I'm fine.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.054
The hospital's on the way to the park.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.597
We'll just pop in and make sure.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.057
No, Mom. Seriously, I'm okay.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.143
No. Alli, your call's gonna have to wait.
I need you to take Daisy.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.728
-But Mom--
-Alli.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.854
Sorry, kiddo.

13:37.025 --> 13:38.943
-Come on.
-Can we just go after the picnic?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.612
-No. Absolutely not. No!
-Please, please, please?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.447
-We're not having an argument about this.
-It's not that serious.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.657
-I'm fine. I'm seriously okay.
-We're going to the hospital. Stop!

13:46.409 --> 13:48.203
[sighs] All right.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.373
[woman] Drop it at the post office.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.004
[coughing]

14:13.645 --> 14:16.439
[doctor] Okay, the scan shows
Zach has got a collapsed lung.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.442
But luckily, the pediatric surgeon has
been able to move some things around,

14:19.526 --> 14:20.985
and we can get you in right now.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.738
Now? Can't we wait until later?

14:24.239 --> 14:26.241
It can't be that big of a deal.
I feel fine.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.618
Your lung is leaking air
and putting pressure on your heart.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.454
If we don't relieve it right away,
you could go into respiratory failure

14:31.538 --> 14:32.539
-or cardiac arrest.
-Mom?

14:32.622 --> 14:34.791
Okay, babe, it's gonna be okay.
They know what they're doing.

14:34.874 --> 14:35.959
-Wait, Mom!
-I love you!

14:36.042 --> 14:37.794
-Laura, I will be right back.
-Okay.

[chimes]

15:35.101 --> 15:38.104
[muffled conversation]

15:43.735 --> 15:44.736
[doctor] Lesions.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.112
[Laura] Lesions?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.239
[Rob] But you said the surgery
was successful.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.534
[doctor] We were able to fix the collapse,
but I'm sorry.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.329
They show that the cancer
has reached Zach's lungs.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.917
[Laura] I don't understand.
We were just given the all clear.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.630
[doctor] As you know, osteosarcoma is
very unpredictable and very resilient.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.632
-[Rob] Then let's do another treatment.
-[Laura] Yeah.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.718
[doctor] I'm afraid Zach's cancer
no longer responds to treatment.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.179
[Laura] Wait, what are you saying?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.099
[doctor] Zach is terminal.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.060
[Zach] How long?

16:19.104 --> 16:22.524
[Laura] Oh, my God. Hey, babe.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.277
[Zach] How long?

16:28.988 --> 16:32.409
Every case is different.
There's no way to really know.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.707
Will I make it to graduation?

16:40.417 --> 16:43.420
[doctor] If graduation is end of spring...

16:44.421 --> 16:45.839
It's hard to say.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.050
We're giving it six to ten months.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.011
I am so sorry.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.434
[trembling]

16:58.768 --> 17:01.855
Mom, can I stop chemo?

17:08.570 --> 17:09.904

18:43.289 --> 18:46.793
Hey, Eli. I heard you crushed it
against South last week, man.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.920
Zach, sorry you couldn't make it.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.046
Yeah, me too, you know?

18:50.130 --> 18:52.924
It's just tough juggling high school
with undercover assassin work.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.634
-Sorry.
-My man.

18:55.677 --> 18:59.055
Ooh. Tess, I'm digging the new color.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.182
Do you mind
if I steal that when this grows back?

19:01.266 --> 19:02.809
-You could pull it off.
-Sweet.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.185
All right. See you, man.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.062
-I'll see you then.
-Yeah, you will.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.188
Running for office?

19:08.106 --> 19:11.109
You know,
just giving the people what they want.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.448
[laughing]

19:21.870 --> 19:26.374
Subtle. You know she's in our next class,

19:26.458 --> 19:28.960
so you might have to tell her eventually.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.048
[school bell rings]

19:33.131 --> 19:37.135
-I mean, you told me.
-Yeah, that's different. You're family.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.853
[Mr. Weaver] Guess who's bizzack?

19:48.271 --> 19:49.814
What's going on, playboy?

19:49.898 --> 19:52.025
It's good to be back, old man.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.736
-Just hope there isn't a pop quiz.
-Well, guess what?

19:54.819 --> 19:57.655
There might be a pop quiz 'cause
you called me "old man." Have a seat.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.700
All right. And for your information,
I'm middle-aged. Big difference.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.453
All right, everybody,
put those phones down.

20:03.536 --> 20:04.954
Let me holla at y'all real quick.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.999
I know when you woke up this morning
you wasn't sure what today was gonna be.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.335
But guess what? It's a special day.

20:10.418 --> 20:14.547
Today is the day
we craft your college essays.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.634
Yay! [laughs]

20:17.717 --> 20:20.512
Now look, I'm not trying
to put no pressure on you at all.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.972
I'm lying. It's a lot of pressure.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.935
I mean, these essays can determine the
whole trajectory of your life. [laughs]

20:27.018 --> 20:28.728
And I'ma help you with that.

20:28.812 --> 20:32.273
Mr. Weaver's gonna help you write
some of the best essays in the state.

20:32.357 --> 20:36.361
My classroom. Nobody else gonna care
but us, but it'll be a big deal to me.

20:37.195 --> 20:41.658
So I came up with three questions to help
you write the perfect college essay.

20:41.741 --> 20:45.995
Question number one: What
do you hope to accomplish in college?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.540
What do you wanna do once you get there?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.583
Do you actually wanna go there to learn,

20:50.667 --> 20:52.544
or do you wanna just go there
and play around?

20:52.627 --> 20:56.089
Beer pong, physics? Think about that.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.927
Number two:
What special attributes do you have

21:01.011 --> 21:03.263
that should qualify you for consideration?

21:03.346 --> 21:05.849
Why should a university accept you?

21:06.349 --> 21:07.726
What do you have to offer?

21:07.809 --> 21:09.728
And not even just to a university,
to the world?

21:09.811 --> 21:11.438
What are your best attributes?

21:11.521 --> 21:13.398
And finally, the last question,

21:13.481 --> 21:16.526
and it comes from
one of my favorite poets, Mary Oliver.

21:19.154 --> 21:25.035
What do you wanna do with your one,
wild and precious life?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.205
Mary Oliver,
one of the greats to ever do it.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.168
Think about that.
You got one life to live.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.339
What are you gonna do with it?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.343
Now get to it.

21:46.181 --> 21:49.351
["And If My Heart Should Somehow Stop"
by James Vincent McMorrow playing]

22:06.034 --> 22:11.373
[Amy] Zach, Zach, Zach. Hey.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.503
[chuckles]

22:18.296 --> 22:20.965
Um, is everything okay?

22:22.550 --> 22:23.593
I'm okay.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.430
Well, I'm really sorry
about your emergency surgery.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.974
I'm sure that was, like, really scary.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.770
It's just the Zach Sobiech I know
wouldn't leave a girl stranded at the park

22:33.853 --> 22:35.939
and never talk to her again.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.775
[school bell rings]

22:57.919 --> 22:59.045
I'm terminal.

23:19.357 --> 23:22.068

23:23.111 --> 23:24.195
You're gonna be late.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.268
[exhales]

24:07.822 --> 24:09.657
[knocking slowly]

24:10.992 --> 24:12.077
Zach?

24:16.206 --> 24:17.415
Honey, what are you--

24:18.041 --> 24:20.293
Baby, it's freezing.
I'm gonna get you a blanket.

24:25.548 --> 24:26.633
Here.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.684
What happened?

24:39.396 --> 24:45.068
In Mr. Weaver's class, we were supposed
to write a... a college essay.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.152
Mm-hmm.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.201
I mean...

24:55.161 --> 24:56.996
what's the point
of writing a college essay

24:57.080 --> 24:59.040
when I'm never even
going to make it to college?

25:04.754 --> 25:06.756
What's the point of anything now?

25:13.388 --> 25:15.015
Hon, what you're facing...

25:18.643 --> 25:23.648
knowing that your time is limited,
it is... scary.

25:24.899 --> 25:28.153
And awful, and I hate it.

25:30.238 --> 25:34.409
I've been thinking lately that none of us
are really promised tomorrow.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.746
We all just assume it's gonna be there.

25:40.081 --> 25:43.376
Maybe it's kinda like a painting.
When you're standing too close to it...

25:44.836 --> 25:47.547
you can see dark bits,
and you can see light bits, but...

25:49.299 --> 25:52.302
you don't really know what you're
looking at until you take a step back.

25:55.597 --> 25:59.851
So maybe, as much as this sucks...

26:01.811 --> 26:04.105
maybe this is some
kind of weird chance for you.

26:05.815 --> 26:11.696
To forget about all the superficial stuff
that people waste their time on.

26:14.282 --> 26:19.079
You get to decide what matters most now.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.875
You get to choose
what your painting's gonna look like.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.013
[man narrating]
Catherine Latapie was the first person

26:37.097 --> 26:38.723
to be miraculously cured at Lourdes.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.643
She was healed of paralysis in 1858.

26:41.726 --> 26:44.354
Physical miracles
are an extraordinary phenomenon.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.523
But many other pilgrims
make their way to Lourdes

26:46.606 --> 26:49.067
for moral healing or spiritual comfort.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.069
Less spectacular miracles, perhaps,

26:51.152 --> 26:53.405
but nevertheless,
important for those Catholics...

26:53.488 --> 26:55.365
[Rob sighs, groans]

26:55.448 --> 26:56.449
What's that?

26:57.617 --> 26:58.743
Oh, it's...

27:00.954 --> 27:05.166
-Where were you?
-Work. Just trying to catch up.

27:08.211 --> 27:09.379
What are you watching?

27:10.797 --> 27:15.218
I was thinking our family
could really use a vacation.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.388
Vacation? Now?

27:19.222 --> 27:22.392
When else?
Zach's always wanted to see the world.

27:22.976 --> 27:23.977
There's--

27:25.645 --> 27:28.273
There's a place in France, Lourdes.

27:28.356 --> 27:31.359
People say the water
can be really healing.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.404
-That it's been curing people--
-Water, really?

27:34.863 --> 27:36.239
He had 24 rounds of chemo.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.783
Yeah, I think I know how many rounds
of chemo he's had.

27:38.867 --> 27:41.536
Well, then you know how much
disappointment he's already had,

27:41.619 --> 27:44.247
-and taking him and dragging him...
-We've all been disappointed.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.416
That doesn't mean
we just give up on our son.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.168
[whispering]
I'm not giving up on our son. Okay?

27:48.251 --> 27:50.003
I just wanna save him from this crazy idea

27:50.086 --> 27:51.713
that a miracle could
all of a sudden happen

27:51.796 --> 27:54.299
just 'cause we went
across the fricking ocean for it.

27:56.634 --> 27:57.886
We need this.

28:05.018 --> 28:08.188
-[Alli] Mom, I can't find my headphones.
-[Rob] Okay, troops, let's hit the road!

28:08.271 --> 28:10.815
-[Laura] They're on the couch.
-Bring on the quality family time.

28:12.442 --> 28:16.571
Yeah, I think Sam's only interested
in quality time with the Moulin Rouge.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.198
Dude, that was supposed to be a secret.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.824
You're kidding, right?

28:20.992 --> 28:23.620
-So does that mean we can't go, or...
-Come on, Grace.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.372
Are you sure we can't take Daisy?

28:25.455 --> 28:28.541
Honey, I promise the Schimnowskis
will take good care of her.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.002
I just feel bad that we're going
to be having fun without her.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.672
Geez, Grace, Daisy can have more fun
shredding a roll of toilet paper

28:33.755 --> 28:35.340
than anyone's ever had in France.

28:35.423 --> 28:38.134
Hey, you leaving without saying bye?

28:39.219 --> 28:41.513
Amy, wha-- Uh, hi.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.264
Hey, Zach. Your hair looks good.

28:43.348 --> 28:46.476
Thank you.
Yeah, it's surprising how fast it grows

28:46.559 --> 28:48.436
when chemicals aren't being pumped
into your body.

Is for horses.

50:56.681 --> 50:58.183
I've always wanted a horse.

50:58.266 --> 51:01.978
I never have, but if you want one,
you shall have one, my dear.

51:03.063 --> 51:04.230

-What?

51:22.207 --> 51:23.249
Our horse.

51:26.920 --> 51:31.091
Um... how about Felicity?

51:31.966 --> 51:33.218
[Zach] Mm.

51:33.885 --> 51:34.969
I was thinking Roger.

51:38.431 --> 51:40.392
-A horse named Roger?
-Yeah.

51:41.935 --> 51:45.230
And that way,
we can name our daughter Felicity.

51:48.817 --> 51:50.026
Our daughter, huh?

51:52.987 --> 51:54.239
Our first daughter.

51:57.450 --> 51:59.119
How many daughters are we having?

52:01.121 --> 52:04.290
At least three, and then three boys.

52:07.168 --> 52:09.045
I always liked how even my family is.

52:09.963 --> 52:11.965
Six kids is a pretty tall order.

-We fell asleep.

54:06.079 --> 54:07.497
Yeah, right.

54:07.580 --> 54:09.749
I need to think about it.
Can I call you back?

54:10.500 --> 54:11.501
You too.

54:12.002 --> 54:14.546
Uh, Mom, did you know
that Amy spent the night?

54:14.629 --> 54:15.714
It wasn't on purpose.

54:15.797 --> 54:18.675
I'm just gonna head home.
My mom keeps on calling me anyways, so...

54:18.758 --> 54:20.218
All right. Thanks a lot, Alli.

54:21.219 --> 54:22.220
All right.

I'll see you. Bye.

Geez. What is the big deal?
We were tired. We cuddled.

Zach, Colin always stays in the basement
whenever he's in town.

Yeah, maybe Colin's
less of a gentleman than I am.

-What?
-Look at that. Look at it.

-You have 20,000 views?
-No way.

-Seriously? For-- For what?
-Sammy... Sammy posted our video.

54:58.506 --> 55:00.633
I just talked to a journalist
who said she saw your video

55:00.717 --> 55:04.054
-and she wants to interview you.
-Why?

55:04.137 --> 55:05.513
Must be a slow news day.

-Shut up.
-[both laugh]

55:06.890 --> 55:09.434
Does she know about the cancer?

55:09.517 --> 55:12.520
She'd like to make it part of the story,
which we can talk about.

55:16.191 --> 55:18.943
[Zach] I dunno. I just--
I don't wanna be some kind of sob story.

55:19.778 --> 55:22.739
[Sammy] Nobody sees you like that,
and if they did, I would tell you.

55:22.822 --> 55:26.951
Yeah, but if this interview does happen
that is what people will think.

55:27.035 --> 55:29.621
If you don't wanna do the interview,
you don't really have to.

55:29.704 --> 55:33.750
Without doing anything,
the video's already up to...

55:35.835 --> 55:37.420
-Holy Toledo.
-How much?

55:39.047 --> 55:40.924
Fifty-one thousand.

55:41.549 --> 55:45.053
Are you serious? What are people saying?

55:45.136 --> 55:51.059
"They harmonize so well together.
More songs please. Are they dating?"

55:53.144 --> 55:56.064
That was timely.
The Internet's so weird sometimes.

55:58.900 --> 56:02.278
-What does that one say?
-That one doesn't say anything.

56:02.362 --> 56:04.656
-Show me.
-No, it's-- It's kind of a dumb one.

56:06.282 --> 56:09.077
"You're not so special.
Lots of kids have cancer."

Yeah. That guy's obviously
a very sad, lonely jerk.

What I wanted was to make an album,

57:00.628 --> 57:03.590
and then go on tour and then write
more songs and make another album.

57:03.673 --> 57:06.843

because it's not gonna happen, is it?

You should play in a bunch of
poker tournaments, without eyebrows.

Is this really happening?

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:13.483

die and go to heaven?

Are we, like, rich and didn't know it?

-No, we are not rich.
-Don't worry. I didn't buy it.

1:02:31.251 --> 1:02:33.044
I borrowed it from Mike,
from the dealership.

1:02:33.128 --> 1:02:35.005
He cleared it so we could drive it
for a week.

1:02:35.088 --> 1:02:37.799

Just don't scratch it, okay?

1:28:34.356 --> 1:28:35.398
[horse whinnies]

1:28:37.484 --> 1:28:39.861
It's a baby horse. Come here!

1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:42.364
-[Amy laughs]
-His name is Roger.

1:28:45.784 --> 1:28:47.118
Hi, Roger.

1:28:47.827 --> 1:28:50.914
-Should I go in? I'm going in.
-Hey, you. Yeah. Go for it.

1:28:54.876 --> 1:28:57.003
I'm touching it. Hello.

1:28:57.837 --> 1:29:00.382
[gasps] Oh, my gosh.

1:29:10.517 --> 1:29:12.519
[thunderclap]

1:29:16.815 --> 1:29:17.649
[grunts]

1:29:17.732 --> 1:29:19.067
-Is that better?
-Yeah.

1:29:19.150 --> 1:29:20.610
-Comfortable?
-Yes.

1:29:21.403 --> 1:29:22.862
Besides the itch on my nose.

1:29:23.363 --> 1:29:24.864
Oh, where? Where is it?

1:29:25.323 --> 1:29:28.868
Mom, I was kidding.
I can still scratch my own nose.

1:29:28.952 --> 1:29:30.203
[chuckles] You brat.

1:29:34.708 --> 1:29:35.709
Okay.

1:29:39.212 --> 1:29:41.214
Should we just get this over with?

1:29:41.297 --> 1:29:42.298
What?

1:29:42.382 --> 1:29:44.676
This fun little list the doctor gave us.

1:29:45.635 --> 1:29:48.263
We don't have to do that now.
You still have time, hon.

1:29:48.930 --> 1:29:51.474
It's not that bad. Come on.

1:30:04.612 --> 1:30:07.032
[sighs]

1:30:08.575 --> 1:30:11.369
[whispering] I don't wanna do this.
I don't wanna say goodbye.

1:30:12.120 --> 1:30:13.663
I think goodbyes can wait.

1:30:15.957 --> 1:30:18.001
Okay. Good.

1:30:19.669 --> 1:30:20.795
[groans]

1:30:22.464 --> 1:30:24.382
Okay. [sniffs]

1:30:26.676 --> 1:30:30.221
"How and where do you wanna die?"

1:30:33.808 --> 1:30:36.186
Skydiving in Florida.

1:30:36.269 --> 1:30:38.271
[laughs]

1:30:41.149 --> 1:30:43.401
And if that doesn't work out,
is there a plan B?

1:30:44.402 --> 1:30:47.614
Gee, I hadn't really thought
about a plan B.

1:30:49.783 --> 1:30:51.076
Mm...

1:30:52.952 --> 1:30:55.205
I wanna be alert enough
to say a proper goodbye.

1:30:57.374 --> 1:31:01.419
And I don't wanna be in the hospital.
I just feel really disconnected.

1:31:02.712 --> 1:31:04.089
Maybe I could just be here.

1:31:05.882 --> 1:31:06.966
On the couch.

1:31:08.426 --> 1:31:11.888
-So I can play Xbox.
-[chuckling]

1:31:11.971 --> 1:31:13.515
Okay. [sniffs]

1:31:14.307 --> 1:31:15.392
Um...

1:31:17.769 --> 1:31:19.562
Organ donations?

1:31:19.646 --> 1:31:21.606
Yeah. Whatever they can use.

1:31:27.946 --> 1:31:29.447
Have you thought about your funeral?

1:31:35.286 --> 1:31:37.497
-We don't have to do this, we can--
-Bagpipes.

1:31:38.623 --> 1:31:39.624
What?

1:31:40.291 --> 1:31:41.418
I want bagpipes.

1:31:44.129 --> 1:31:45.130
Okay.

1:31:46.006 --> 1:31:49.050
And no Psalm 23. It's overdone.

1:31:51.094 --> 1:31:54.347
I want the gospel about the talents.
That one makes sense to me.

1:31:55.557 --> 1:31:56.558
Yeah.

1:31:56.641 --> 1:31:59.811
And no suit. I feel like
it would just be too uptight-looking.

1:32:01.855 --> 1:32:02.856
Maybe, like...

1:32:05.400 --> 1:32:07.485
tie and my vest.

1:32:07.569 --> 1:32:10.030
-I like your vest.
-Yeah, me too.

1:32:10.113 --> 1:32:11.114
[sniffs]

1:32:14.159 --> 1:32:15.618
And maybe these.

1:32:16.703 --> 1:32:18.246
[Laura laughs]

1:32:18.329 --> 1:32:20.290
I think they really make my eyes pop.

1:32:23.918 --> 1:32:25.545
Oh, my word.

1:32:31.634 --> 1:32:33.011
Okay. What next?

1:32:34.262 --> 1:32:35.889
-Did you shoot any three-pointers?
-[Grace] Yeah.

1:32:35.972 --> 1:32:37.599
[Sammy] Did you shoot any touchdowns?

1:32:37.682 --> 1:32:39.726
-No, I got a hole in one. Yeah.
-A hole in one?

1:32:39.809 --> 1:32:41.561
[both laughing]

1:32:41.644 --> 1:32:44.564
-[Rob] All right. Here, have some salad.
-He's too tired to come up.

1:32:46.316 --> 1:32:47.317
Oh.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:50.070
Um... do you guys want me to leave?
I can--

1:32:50.153 --> 1:32:52.614
What? No, Sammy, course not.

1:32:55.075 --> 1:32:56.701
-Water?
-Thanks.

1:33:01.998 --> 1:33:04.542
What's... What's going on?

1:33:12.050 --> 1:33:16.054
We spoke with the doctor today,
and he thinks...

1:33:19.140 --> 1:33:21.976
He's not sure
if Zach's gonna make it to prom.

1:33:25.438 --> 1:33:26.773
That's, like, a month away.

1:33:31.778 --> 1:33:34.030
I know it's hard to hear.

1:33:35.949 --> 1:33:39.411
We wanted to discuss it with you,
uh... [inhales]

1:33:39.494 --> 1:33:42.580
...because we all know how much Zach
has been looking forward to prom.

1:33:42.664 --> 1:33:45.250
Right? Especially since
he and Amy got back together,

1:33:45.333 --> 1:33:49.713
and we were hoping that maybe we
could find a way to still give him that.

1:33:49.796 --> 1:33:50.880
How?

1:33:50.964 --> 1:33:53.091
Well, we thought we would
throw him a party.

1:33:53.174 --> 1:33:54.801
[laughing]

1:33:54.884 --> 1:33:57.220
The best party ever.
Birthday, graduation, prom.

1:33:57.303 --> 1:33:59.973
Everything he's ever gonna miss,
all rolled into one.

1:34:00.056 --> 1:34:01.099
[chuckles]

1:34:01.182 --> 1:34:03.893
What do you think? Sounds good, right?

1:34:03.977 --> 1:34:05.937
-I mean, he loves a party. Right?
-Yeah.

1:34:06.021 --> 1:34:07.439
What if we did it at the Metro?

1:34:09.149 --> 1:34:10.233
It's only a couple weeks away.

1:34:10.316 --> 1:34:12.027
-Yeah.
-That's a great idea.

1:34:12.110 --> 1:34:14.779
Yeah, maybe you and Amy
could get the whole school to come.

1:34:14.863 --> 1:34:16.865
-Yeah.
-We can get the whole town to come.

1:34:16.948 --> 1:34:19.659
[chuckles] I could call the radio station,
get them involved.

1:34:19.743 --> 1:34:20.869
He'll love that.

1:34:20.952 --> 1:34:22.704
-[all laughing]
-He will love it.

1:34:23.204 --> 1:34:26.082
-[Laura] Everyone's coming. Okay?
-He'll like that.

1:34:26.166 --> 1:34:27.709
He's gonna love it.

1:34:28.793 --> 1:34:31.755
-Great. Pass the potatoes?
-[Alli] Yeah.

1:34:31.838 --> 1:34:33.631
[Laura] Thank you, honey. Okay.

1:34:33.715 --> 1:34:36.468
Okay, great. So we'll see you there?

1:34:36.551 --> 1:34:38.053
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

1:34:38.136 --> 1:34:41.639
["Ames" by A Firm Handshake playing]

1:34:47.062 --> 1:34:50.482
Michelle? Hi. Laura Sobiech.

1:34:50.565 --> 1:34:53.735
Yeah, I wanted to let you know
we're having a celebration for Zach...

1:35:01.576 --> 1:35:02.577
[Sammy] Hi.

1:35:04.287 --> 1:35:05.997
Okay, this is for you.

1:35:06.581 --> 1:35:08.416
I think this one is yours.

1:35:09.542 --> 1:35:11.127
You got this.
We're gonna learn this tonight.

1:35:11.211 --> 1:35:12.462
Thank you guys so much for coming.

1:35:14.714 --> 1:35:16.966
How did you do that many? I don't--

1:35:18.551 --> 1:35:20.553
-Are you struggling?
-Yeah, a little bit.

1:35:42.742 --> 1:35:46.413
Sorry. Sorry, guys.
Can we start from the top one more time?

1:35:50.291 --> 1:35:53.461
[song continues]

1:35:54.796 --> 1:35:56.089
Shh.

1:36:01.636 --> 1:36:05.682
Uh, they wanna know
if we need to cancel the show tonight.

1:36:05.765 --> 1:36:07.017
[song fades]

1:36:08.435 --> 1:36:09.728
We have two hours.

1:36:10.895 --> 1:36:12.897
I'll let Sam know.
He should be on his way.

1:36:21.322 --> 1:36:25.326
Zach is a fighter.
But his body is shutting down.

1:36:26.286 --> 1:36:28.830
Could be days, or sooner.

1:36:29.330 --> 1:36:32.083
At this point, it's hard to tell.

1:36:32.167 --> 1:36:34.127
The best thing we can do
for Zach right now

1:36:34.210 --> 1:36:36.838
is to make sure he's comfortable.

1:36:36.921 --> 1:36:38.506
Okay. [cries]

1:36:41.301 --> 1:36:44.679
-Thank you.
-You call me if you need me.

1:36:46.473 --> 1:36:48.475
[Rob] Thank you. Thank you.

1:36:52.270 --> 1:36:54.272
[Laura cries]

1:36:54.356 --> 1:36:56.107
-It's not fair.
-I know it isn't.

1:36:58.026 --> 1:37:00.945
All right, I'm gonna call Sammy
'cause she needs to go on without him.

1:37:01.029 --> 1:37:02.530
Okay.

1:37:04.032 --> 1:37:05.533
[sobs]

1:37:08.953 --> 1:37:10.121
I gotta let Amy know.

1:37:10.205 --> 1:37:11.623
Okay, love.

1:37:15.377 --> 1:37:17.462
[Grace sobbing]

1:37:17.545 --> 1:37:19.297
Oh, Grace.

1:37:24.511 --> 1:37:25.887
[Laura exhales]

1:37:29.224 --> 1:37:30.642
Have you gone down to see him?

1:37:32.018 --> 1:37:33.103
I can't.

1:37:36.356 --> 1:37:39.567
We don't know
how much time he has left, sweetheart.

1:37:39.651 --> 1:37:41.653
-Mom, I can't.
-You can. You know what?

1:37:41.736 --> 1:37:44.030
-Just you go sit with him.
-Please don't make me.

1:37:44.114 --> 1:37:47.033
You don't have to say anything.
You just go sit with him.

1:37:48.201 --> 1:37:53.748
It will be okay. Okay?
Go on. Go on, honey.

1:37:57.002 --> 1:37:59.337
It's okay. Go on, honey. It's okay.

1:38:03.717 --> 1:38:05.969
[labored breathing]

1:38:14.477 --> 1:38:15.979
Hey, dork.

1:38:21.609 --> 1:38:24.863
[sobbing]

1:38:24.946 --> 1:38:26.656
What am I gonna do without you?

1:38:40.045 --> 1:38:41.296
[groans]

1:38:59.230 --> 1:39:00.523
Watch whatever you want.

1:39:01.900 --> 1:39:03.693

1:39:09.616 --> 1:39:12.243
[TV plays quietly]

1:39:12.327 --> 1:39:16.247
[labored breathing continues]

1:39:16.748 --> 1:39:17.999
I love you.

1:39:46.069 --> 1:39:47.153
Hey.

1:39:49.072 --> 1:39:50.115
Hey.

1:39:52.367 --> 1:39:54.285
He made us promise we'd still go.

1:39:59.624 --> 1:40:01.042
Thank you for staying with him.

1:40:02.711 --> 1:40:04.713
[TV plays quietly]

1:40:07.966 --> 1:40:08.967
[Zach] Hey.

1:40:13.013 --> 1:40:14.347
Help me with my tie?

1:40:15.432 --> 1:40:16.474
Zach.

1:40:19.185 --> 1:40:20.311
What are you--

1:40:20.395 --> 1:40:22.022
-Zach, you're--
-[labored breathing]

1:40:22.105 --> 1:40:24.399
You're supposed to be in bed.
What are you--

1:40:27.861 --> 1:40:31.031
You're going to get your prom, Amy Adamle.

1:40:33.658 --> 1:40:36.703
Are you sure? I don't need a prom.

1:40:37.787 --> 1:40:38.830
We're going.

1:40:44.294 --> 1:40:49.257
[chattering]

1:40:53.386 --> 1:40:56.973
Zach! Good luck, my man.
You're gonna crush it tonight!

1:40:57.807 --> 1:40:58.808
Hurry up!

1:40:59.893 --> 1:41:01.102
This is all you.

1:41:02.896 --> 1:41:04.939
Okay, it's cold. [chuckles]

1:41:09.110 --> 1:41:10.904
This time it's your name in the lights.

1:41:12.155 --> 1:41:14.449
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1:41:22.457 --> 1:41:24.334
-[stagehand] Have a great show.
-Thanks so much.

1:41:24.417 --> 1:41:25.669
[man] Kick ass, Zach.

1:41:28.588 --> 1:41:30.799
[stagehand]
Okay. Yeah, we got Zach stage right.

1:41:31.299 --> 1:41:33.301
[crowd chattering]

1:41:35.053 --> 1:41:36.179
[exhales]

1:41:39.015 --> 1:41:40.100
[Sammy] Hey, gimpy.

1:41:42.060 --> 1:41:45.772
-You made it.
-Yeah. I made it.

1:41:46.690 --> 1:41:48.400
Right. Just don't screw it up.

1:41:48.483 --> 1:41:51.486
[crowd cheering, clapping]

1:41:53.154 --> 1:41:55.573
[Mr. Weaver] Yes. Yes.

1:41:57.117 --> 1:41:58.368
Yes, yes.

1:42:00.704 --> 1:42:02.706
Well, first of all,
I'd like to welcome you

1:42:02.789 --> 1:42:07.252
to the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund
Prom Party and Concert!

1:42:07.335 --> 1:42:10.380
[cheering]

1:42:10.922 --> 1:42:11.923
That's right.

1:42:13.466 --> 1:42:15.176
This is the party of all parties!

1:42:16.136 --> 1:42:18.722
This beautiful and amazing occasion

1:42:18.805 --> 1:42:22.017
reminds me of a quote
from the great Sadie Delany which says,

1:42:22.100 --> 1:42:25.854
"Life is short,
and it's up to you to make it sweet."

1:42:27.272 --> 1:42:31.317
And, honestly,
I don't think anything is sweeter

1:42:31.401 --> 1:42:36.114
than seeing all you guys come together
for Zach. Yeah.

1:42:36.197 --> 1:42:39.242
[cheering, applause]

1:42:39.325 --> 1:42:42.162
Now, without further ado,

1:42:42.245 --> 1:42:45.290
coming to the stage
is the other half of A Firm Handshake.

1:42:45.373 --> 1:42:48.251
Give it up for Sammy Brown, everybody.
Sammy Brown!

1:42:48.335 --> 1:42:49.461
[cheering, applause]

1:42:49.544 --> 1:42:50.545
Wish me luck.

1:42:59.012 --> 1:43:00.013
Go get 'em.

1:43:02.599 --> 1:43:04.893
[cheering, applause continues]

1:43:10.982 --> 1:43:12.108
Um...

1:43:13.068 --> 1:43:15.945
Thank you, Milton.

1:43:16.029 --> 1:43:18.239
[crowd] Ooh!

1:43:18.323 --> 1:43:19.908
[man in audience] Don't take that, Weaver!

1:43:19.991 --> 1:43:24.371
So, um,
Zach's family asked me to sing a song,

1:43:24.454 --> 1:43:27.248
and this one's called,
"How to Go to Confession."

1:43:29.292 --> 1:43:30.543
Wrote it for a friend.

1:43:33.755 --> 1:43:35.173
[music starts]
