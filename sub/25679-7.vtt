00:17.384 --> 00:19.119

00:33.500 --> 00:35.668
{\an7}But he's married to you
and he's dating my friend.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.036
{\an8}You don't know
what she got going on!

00:37.103 --> 00:39.105
{\an8}Maybe she don't
wanna tell you.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.840
{\an8}You're aware
that he's married to Sade.

00:40.907 --> 00:42.208
{\an8}That's right.

00:40.907 --> 00:42.208
{\an8}And dating

an explanation

00:50.617 --> 00:53.686
{\an8}as to why my emotions

A1 needs to check his family.

{\an8}She only feeds
off her mother.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.031
{\an1}She asked
why you're here?

02:12.098 --> 02:14.400
{\an6}Yes!

02:12.098 --> 02:14.400
Why would my mom be here?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.307
{\an5}Congratulations, guys.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.307

It's never check them!

02:29.716 --> 02:30.917
No, it's check everybody.

{\an1}You ain't checking us.
We checking you.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.289
{\an1}You're the problem
with them.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.924
They wasn't even supposed
to be involved.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.293
You involved
them mother(bleep)!

02:40.360 --> 02:42.996
{\an5}Y'all wanna know
why I involved them?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.996
Yeah, I wanna know.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.765
Because you got another

02:49.669 --> 02:51.070
That's (bleep) up!

02:51.137 --> 02:52.805
{\an1}Before I play uncle
to anybody,

02:52.872 --> 02:54.874
make sure it's yours.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.209
Boy, stop,
don't play with me.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.912
{\an5}(A1)
My family is totally
out of line.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.980
But Loyd is even more foul

03:01.047 --> 03:03.416
for suggesting that
the baby isn't mine.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.084
They need to get
all these rumors

03:05.151 --> 03:07.153
out of they head
and understand

03:07.220 --> 03:09.856
that I talked to my wife,
and we've forgiven each other.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.457
And we made a baby.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.592
{\an1}She'd been trying
to get pregnant

03:12.659 --> 03:13.760
{\an1}when she had that talk
with us last time.

03:13.826 --> 03:15.328
{\an1}She think a baby
gonna keep a (bleep).

03:15.395 --> 03:18.464
{\an1}And did she get pregnant before
he left her ass or after?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.800
Or before she start
(bleep) with Safaree?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.769
My son and Lyrica,
they separated

03:22.835 --> 03:24.037
for a couple of weeks.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.405
Now she's pregnant?

03:25.471 --> 03:27.106
When did they have time
to do that?

03:27.173 --> 03:28.441
They just got back together.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.776
{\an1}(A1)
Yo.

03:29.842 --> 03:32.045
Boy, your family is out
of (bleep) control.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.781
{\an1}The last time you saw me,
you threw me out of the house.

03:34.847 --> 03:36.583
You haven't even
apologized for that!

03:36.649 --> 03:39.519
{\an1}My whole intentions
was to apologize to you.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.522
{\an5}But-- but you didn't.

03:39.586 --> 03:42.522
So, I'm sorry.

03:42.589 --> 03:47.026
Honestly, this turned into
a freaking disaster, per usual.

03:47.093 --> 03:49.228
{\an4}(groans)

03:47.093 --> 03:49.228
This was supposed
to be a special moment.

03:49.295 --> 03:51.598
And me and A1 were supposed
to tell you guys

03:51.664 --> 03:52.699
that I'm pregnant.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.168
{\an4}Yeah.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.168
Are you (bleep) kidding me?

03:55.234 --> 03:57.003
{\an1}Your baby
having a baby.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.972
{\an5}(chuckles)

03:57.070 --> 03:58.972
{\an3}I gotta go.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.441
(car horn honking)

04:01.507 --> 04:05.812
{\an8}Having a baby with her husband
is healthy.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.847
The thing that's not healthy

04:07.914 --> 04:10.650
is the relationship
and the people in the family.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.318
(sobbing)

04:14.687 --> 04:17.724

I get why my mom is so upset.

04:24.497 --> 04:25.665

just been

04:25.732 --> 04:27.100
one of the peaceful ones with us

04:27.166 --> 04:28.968
and just said,
"Congratulations,

It's not "mine."

Amber is beautiful,
but she's a spoiled bitch,

06:01.794 --> 06:02.995
and it's all my fault.

06:03.062 --> 06:05.331
I do everything
for Amber.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.867
I don't want her to grow up
with nothing, like I did.

06:07.934 --> 06:10.670
{\an5}Where your music at?

06:07.934 --> 06:10.670
Roccstar said that it
wasn't gonna be ready

06:10.737 --> 06:12.405
until we get, like,
did the party,

06:12.472 --> 06:13.840

and stuff like that.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.449
{\an1}with no music, and this
(bleep) got 20 bands?

06:23.516 --> 06:25.585
{\an1}I mean, honestly,
I feel good about the song.

06:25.651 --> 06:26.919
I feel like the song's
gonna be dope,

06:26.986 --> 06:28.221

{\an1}Okay, well,

06:44.337 --> 06:46.773
{\an1}What other mom go hard

If I come over harsh,

You know what?

{\an1}I'll see you
at your single release party.

07:30.783 --> 07:34.487
I don't wanna be all involved
in Teairra's relationship drama,

07:34.554 --> 07:36.823
but I cannot let Akbar
ruin her.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.157
He doesn't only have a wife,

07:38.224 --> 07:40.626
he got another side bitch
who isn't Teairra.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.562
{\an8}I just need Teetee
to know everything,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.764
{\an8}and then maybe she's come
to her senses.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.799
{\an8}So, what is up, boo?

07:46.866 --> 07:47.967
{\an8}Honey, just working.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.536
{\an8}Sister's busy.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.536
{\an8}Yeah, exactly.

who else is busy?

Are you still stuck
on the blog stuff?

Oh, I'm not stuck
on the blog stuff.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.816
{\an1}But something in my gut,
and I have a really big gut.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.319
I felt like he really
was married.

08:06.385 --> 08:09.222
So, what I did was,
I reached out to the girl,

08:09.288 --> 08:11.123
Sade, on social media.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.793
Basically, she has
a clothing line.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.329
{\an1}I lied and told her
that Nikki wanted to invest

08:16.395 --> 08:18.130
in her clothing line.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.432
She comes to meet
with us...

08:19.498 --> 08:21.901
{\an5}Oh, so you sat-- oh, God.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.901
Yeah, sat down with her.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.270
Come to find out,
they really are together.

08:26.005 --> 08:26.973
Yeah, she said
they've been married

08:27.039 --> 08:27.974
for, like, six years.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.308
She said legally?

08:29.375 --> 08:31.577
Yeah, she really said
they're married.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.945
Showed a ring.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.380
And she was showing us
videos of them,

08:34.447 --> 08:35.648
and they just
celebrated her birthday.

08:35.715 --> 08:36.982
They just was together
for her birthday.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.051
She said they got
a place in LA, Atlanta...

08:39.118 --> 08:40.318
{\an6}Dallas.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.318
...and Dallas.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.221
{\an4}Really?

08:40.385 --> 08:42.221
{\an3}Yes!

08:42.288 --> 08:44.657
{\an1}I asked him
about Sade twice.

08:44.724 --> 08:47.793
{\an1}You just been flat-footed
(bleep) lying to me.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.796
To top the bull(bleep),
it ain't even just Sade.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.298
There's another female.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.934
{\an1}So, are they married too?
Is this some concubine (bleep)?

08:55.001 --> 08:57.103
But get this, she knew
about Sade too.

08:57.169 --> 09:00.172
{\an4}Oh, it's some
concubine (bleep).

08:57.169 --> 09:00.172
So it's like everybody
is together but you.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.876
But the thing is,
that's so crazy,

09:03.943 --> 09:06.045
is that they all know about you
and they're all okay with it.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.747
It's like he's using
Teairra to get on--

09:07.813 --> 09:09.615
He ain't worried
about me, yeah.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.284
{\an4}And he's pretending
that he cares.

09:09.682 --> 09:11.284
Neither one of them
bitches is on.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.718
{\an3}Right.

09:12.785 --> 09:14.587
{\an1}I'm brokenhearted
by the whole situation.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.490
I know, I know.
So, what you wanna do?

09:17.556 --> 09:19.625
Anything you wanna do
from here, I'm with you.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.328
{\an5}I'm your friend,
I'm here to support you

{\an1}But I've already
talked to him before.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.732

like, roundtable discussion

with one or two,
or three or four,

09:28.834 --> 09:31.037

12:37.490 --> 12:39.425
{\an9}Yes, you.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.360
I know what I did.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.763
{\an1}I said something
I should not have said.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.665
What did I do to you

12:46.732 --> 12:49.869
{\an1}for you to take information
that I gave you,

12:49.935 --> 12:51.570
and trusted
and confided in you

12:51.637 --> 12:54.306
{\an5}for you to go...

12:51.637 --> 12:54.306
{\an1}Safaree, it's not
what you did.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.375
But Lyrica coming for me,

12:56.442 --> 12:59.178
{\an1}I said one thing
I let slip out out of anger--

12:59.245 --> 13:01.147
There wasn't, like,
more other ammunition

13:01.213 --> 13:03.649
{\an5}you could've used
in that moment?

13:01.213 --> 13:03.649
Well, I had shot it all!

13:05.618 --> 13:08.320
(K. Michelle)
Safaree told me

13:08.387 --> 13:12.091
that Lyrica was trying
to ride his sausage.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.360
What them two grown people
did after that,

13:14.426 --> 13:16.729
uh-uh, I ain't gonna make up
no (bleep) about her.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.631
You know,
in the heat of the moment,

13:18.697 --> 13:22.635
I wasn't thinking about how
that bit of information

13:22.701 --> 13:24.069
could hurt my friend Safaree,

13:24.136 --> 13:26.338
and I definitely am not
trying to hurt him.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.439
It ain't about me.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.276
{\an1}It's about me being
woman enough

13:30.342 --> 13:32.945
{\an1}to say to you
that I'm sorry.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.181
{\an1}I'm really sorry,
I'm so sorry.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.049
I accept your apology.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.620
{\an4}Stop!

13:38.517 --> 13:41.620
(both laugh)

13:41.687 --> 13:43.489
{\an1}Bitches need to learn
how to put their fingers down

13:43.556 --> 13:45.357
and keep their (bleep) closed.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.959
{\an1}Why is she texting
my friend?

13:47.026 --> 13:48.127
{\an1}She shouldn't have been
texting my friend.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.696
Go home to your
(bleep) husband.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.131

something that happened

13:52.198 --> 13:53.732
that you probably don't
even know happened.

to pull up to the studio.

13:56.101 --> 13:58.871
This guy comes outside
going crazy.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.006

come back to LA.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.074
You have nothing
to worry about,

14:02.141 --> 14:03.909
{\an1}I mean, you didn't
do anything.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.111
You didn't like her,
she wasn't your type.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.846
Look, look, it's--

14:07.913 --> 14:09.815
I'm just glad
that all I told you.

have poked curly fry.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.630
{\an6}Listen--

14:22.595 --> 14:24.630
I think you did.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.771
Look, humbly speaking,

14:32.838 --> 14:36.742
{\an1}I'm probably one of the,
if not, the best-looking man

14:36.809 --> 14:38.277
on the face of this planet.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.180
{\an1}So, if a woman has her chance
to shoot her shot with me,

14:41.247 --> 14:43.582
she is going
to shoot her shot.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.684
So I cannot blame
any woman.

14:45.751 --> 14:50.022
{\an1}Ohh ho ho!
You cannot blame them?

14:50.089 --> 14:51.090
Okay, friend.

These two women have been
hypnotized or something.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.461
Do they realize how this man
is treating 'em?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.296
Anybody that wants
to deal with Akbar

22:44.362 --> 22:45.697

I'm first, she's second,

22:47.599 --> 22:49.568
{\an1}and if you're dealing with us,
bitch, you're gonna be last.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.269
{\an5}I wanna speak.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.269
Don't call me a bitch.

22:51.336 --> 22:52.771
{\an5}Understand that.

22:51.336 --> 22:52.771
No, you don't talk to me.

I'm not trying to be arguing
with females over a man.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.454
If this man
is gonna be my man,

23:09.521 --> 23:11.556
he's gonna be all mine.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.326

23:28.306 --> 23:29.608
You're serious about this.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.443

Oh, well, good,
that's why I'm out!

23:36.848 --> 23:38.984
This is why you don't pick
without me.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.386
{\an6}Truth.

23:39.050 --> 23:41.386
This is why you
do not pick without me.

23:41.453 --> 23:42.754
(Teairra)
Picked without her?

23:42.821 --> 23:44.890
I definitely don't need
to be vetted.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.392
I don't wanna be a part
of this organization,

23:49.661 --> 23:51.963
You should've went with me
before you picked somebody.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.398
We're supposed
to pick together,

23:53.465 --> 23:54.432
and you decided to pick
on your own.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.801
See?
See what you did?

23:55.867 --> 23:57.135
{\an5}This is what happens--

23:55.867 --> 23:57.135
{\an3}You lied.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.171
Because you don't wanna--
you don't wanna share it.

23:59.237 --> 24:00.972
Yeah, I don't share
my men, baby.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.274
{\an1}But when you with me,
how do you feel?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.042
{\an1}Be honest, you take them away,
how did I treat you?

24:04.109 --> 24:05.710
You told me
that was your ex.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.646
{\an5}How did I treat you?

24:05.777 --> 24:07.646
So, I thought that
I was the only one.

24:07.712 --> 24:09.981
{\an1}No, what you thought was
he was gonna leave me for you!

24:10.048 --> 24:11.016
No, he said--

24:11.082 --> 24:13.685
(overlapping shouting)

24:13.752 --> 24:15.854
This is what I said
I wasn't gonna do.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.396
Talking (bleep),
getting offended,

29:25.463 --> 29:27.232
like, "No, he's
a good person."

29:27.298 --> 29:30.168
{\an4}So, we tell Teairra
about her.

29:27.298 --> 29:30.168
{\an3}Okay.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.036
{\an1}Teairra like, "Yo,
let's go run down on Akbar."

29:32.103 --> 29:33.605
{\an6}Ooh!

29:32.103 --> 29:33.605
He got both girls

29:33.671 --> 29:35.240
{\an5}there at the same time.

29:33.671 --> 29:35.240
No, what are you saying?

29:35.306 --> 29:36.708
{\an1}One and two, they asking
Teairra to be number three.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.643
{\an5}This is a real thing?

29:36.774 --> 29:38.643
A real thing.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.278
{\an5}It got physical.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.278
Ohh! What happened?

29:40.345 --> 29:42.347
Sade, she wanna fight Teairra.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.182
{\an1}Next thing you know,
Xena, she jump up,

29:44.249 --> 29:46.050
{\an1}she coming
towards me, too.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.318
Yes. Oh, yeah!

29:47.385 --> 29:48.853
This some good tea.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.456
Now, I've known Akbar
had a whole plethora

29:51.523 --> 29:53.391
of women in his life
over the years,

29:53.458 --> 29:56.794
but I cannot sleep knowing
that Teairra did not know.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.430
That's why I opened my big mouth
and I said something,

29:59.497 --> 30:01.065
but for a good cause.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.735
♪♪

30:08.106 --> 30:10.642
{\an8}My daughter and I
definitely know

30:10.708 --> 30:12.143
{\an8}how to push
each other's buttons.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.746
{\an8}But as the Mom-anager in this,

30:14.812 --> 30:16.514
I try to be
the bigger person.

30:16.581 --> 30:20.018
It's her single release party,
and I gotta support my baby.

30:20.084 --> 30:22.153
Plus, I invested 20 bands.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.989
I need to see what
this Roccstar done cooked up.

30:25.056 --> 30:27.458
{\an5}You look so pretty, baby.

30:25.056 --> 30:27.458
Thanks.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.194
{\an8}So, you're not mad
at me no more?

30:29.260 --> 30:32.297
{\an7}I wasn't upset with you,
I was more so trying

30:32.363 --> 30:34.866
{\an1}to explain to you that
I want the best for you, so...

30:34.933 --> 30:36.534
Yeah, and I
understand that, Mom.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.670
You know I love you.
You're an amazing mom,

30:38.736 --> 30:40.738
and I appreciate you, so...

30:40.805 --> 30:42.507
{\an6}Yeah.

30:40.805 --> 30:42.507
{\an1}You think
I'm the best mom?

30:42.574 --> 30:43.841
You're the best mom.

30:45.276 --> 30:46.778
What's up, y'all?
Thank y'all for coming out.

30:46.844 --> 30:49.547
{\an8}Let's make some noise
for Amber Diamond.

30:49.614 --> 30:50.915

30:49.614 --> 30:50.915

I can't even recognize
her voice!

31:39.831 --> 31:43.134
Not worth 10 dimes

Okay, hold on!

31:44.702 --> 31:46.671

on Amber's vocals

31:56.514 --> 31:58.449

32:14.032 --> 32:16.434
This is too much
unclassy (bleep).

32:16.501 --> 32:18.803
I could
already predict

32:18.870 --> 32:22.073
{\an5}that she might be
flying off the handle
at some point in time.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.542
And just in case
I was unappreciated,

32:24.609 --> 32:26.744
I kept the raw vocals.

32:26.811 --> 32:28.379
You could keep
the remaining 20K,

32:38.690 --> 32:41.459
All right, listen.
The show has adjourned.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.027
Thank you for coming out
to Amber Diamond's--

32:43.094 --> 32:46.097
{\an1}You can't adjourn
nothing that I paid for!

32:46.164 --> 32:49.901
{\an5}This guy's wack.
And you got me out here
looking stupid.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.236
{\an1}I paid the bread--
you listen to what I say

32:52.303 --> 32:53.371
{\an1}and let me show you
what's up.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.839
{\an5}Okay, getting too much.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.839
No, you are!

32:54.906 --> 32:56.174
That's your problem!

32:56.240 --> 32:58.042
The song was okay.

32:58.109 --> 33:00.378
And this (bleep) jacked me
for 20 bands!

33:03.715 --> 33:05.583
{\an8}I can't look the homie
in the eye

33:05.650 --> 33:08.252
{\an8}if I don't have
my other friend lay out

33:08.319 --> 33:09.987
{\an8}(bleep) that he been
telling me.

33:19.430 --> 33:24.369
{\an8}♪♪

33:24.435 --> 33:27.505
{\an1}I'm so happy
I'm out the house.

33:27.572 --> 33:28.840
{\an1}Thank you.

33:32.043 --> 33:33.444
{\an8}Why they not here yet?

33:33.511 --> 33:34.846
{\an8}It's all good, though,
you know?

33:34.912 --> 33:37.682
Because I'm happy that A1
and Lyrica just wasn't

33:37.749 --> 33:38.816
sitting here waiting for us.

33:38.883 --> 33:39.951
Because, you know,

33:40.017 --> 33:41.519
I just been feeling,
you know, that way.

33:41.586 --> 33:44.989
{\an8}I'm uncomfortable with--
with looking at the homey.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.225
{\an6}You know?

33:45.056 --> 33:47.225
You need to get over it.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.693
I'm just telling you
before it happen

33:48.760 --> 33:51.162
{\an3}that, um...

33:51.229 --> 33:52.830
I told Safaree
to come along.

33:53.998 --> 33:55.366
I did, I told him
to pull up.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.870
Because I felt like it
was the right thing to do.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.538
{\an1}That's the wrong thing to do.
Why would you do that?

34:00.605 --> 34:02.006
They invited us out.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.241
{\an1}We're supposed
to have a good time,

34:03.307 --> 34:04.942
{\an1}and now, like,
it looks like...

34:06.711 --> 34:08.646
I'll pay the bill.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.214
{\an5}Yo!

34:08.713 --> 34:10.214
(Ray J)
Hey!

34:10.281 --> 34:11.516
Ray-Ray!

34:11.581 --> 34:13.083
{\an3}What's up,
my brother?

34:13.150 --> 34:15.652
{\an3}What's up,
little one?

34:15.719 --> 34:17.054
{\an3}Hey...

34:17.121 --> 34:18.688
Hi...

34:18.755 --> 34:20.123
I love dinner,
I really do.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.693
But to sit here
and lie to A1's face

34:22.760 --> 34:25.362
is really, really,
really unsettling.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.533
I'm really optimistic that
everything will turn around,

34:28.599 --> 34:31.002
so my special guest
for tonight's gathering

34:31.068 --> 34:32.402
is for the greater good.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.205
{\an5}Hi!

34:32.469 --> 34:34.205
You look good....

34:34.272 --> 34:35.873
(squealing and laughing)

34:35.940 --> 34:37.675
{\an7}It's late, but y'all
look good, though,

34:37.742 --> 34:39.577
{\an8}so it's cool.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.577
{\an8}Now...

34:39.643 --> 34:41.679
{\an8}Princess, I'm so sorry
that I, like,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.380
{\an8}missed your
gender reveal and...

34:43.447 --> 34:46.016
{\an1}It's okay. Actually,
that was perfect timing.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.485
And I hate for us
to fight, honestly.

34:48.553 --> 34:49.719
I-- I apologize.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.289
I haven't been
myself lately.

34:51.355 --> 34:52.657
{\an7}I've been going through
some things,

34:52.723 --> 34:54.358
{\an8}had to get rid of
one of his hoes.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.693
{\an8}But it doesn't matter

34:55.760 --> 34:57.829
because... ahem...

34:57.895 --> 34:59.630
Ohh!

34:59.697 --> 35:01.432
This is turning into
an engagement party.

35:01.499 --> 35:02.600
(all cheering)

35:02.667 --> 35:03.801
Like "Coming to America"!

35:03.868 --> 35:05.303
(overlapping chatter)

35:05.369 --> 35:07.371
{\an1}Mrs. Black
on the way, honey.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.940
{\an1}Wait, hold on, I have
something to tell y'all, too.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.975
Hold on, bro.
Oh...

35:11.042 --> 35:12.477
Well, first of all,
me and her are back.

35:12.543 --> 35:13.678
{\an1}And...

35:16.948 --> 35:17.915
We're having a baby!

35:17.982 --> 35:19.884
(women shrieking)

35:21.152 --> 35:22.353
Are you serious?!

35:22.420 --> 35:23.521
(laughter and shrieking)

35:23.588 --> 35:24.589
{\an3}Hey, hey!

35:24.655 --> 35:26.624
(overlapping chatter)

35:26.691 --> 35:27.625
Time out!

35:28.759 --> 35:29.927
(whistle blows)

35:29.994 --> 35:32.196
These two were
separated for weeks.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.197
Weeks!

35:33.264 --> 35:35.032
Only thing
I can wonder now

35:35.099 --> 35:37.001
is whose baby is this?

35:37.068 --> 35:38.836
A1's...

35:38.903 --> 35:40.571
or Safaree's?

35:40.638 --> 35:41.873
Congrats, everybody.

35:41.939 --> 35:44.442
Penises, vaginas,
and babies, yay!

35:44.509 --> 35:46.344
(all cheering)

35:46.410 --> 35:48.813
{\an1}Look me in my eyes
so I know it's real.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.882
{\an1}I have to go to the bathroom.
You wanna come with me?

35:50.948 --> 35:52.683
Yeah, of course.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.318
(Princess)
If Safaree's showing up tonight,

35:54.385 --> 35:55.786
that's bad enough.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.788
But to know
that Lyrica's pregnant...

35:57.855 --> 36:00.258
She needs to know immediately
what's about to go down,

36:00.324 --> 36:03.628
because my childish-ass husband
couldn't keep his mouth shut.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.233
{\an7}Okay now.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.334
{\an1}Y'all know,
when they come back,

36:10.401 --> 36:11.602
they gonna be
hella hungry.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.137
They-- they eatin' for two.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.640
{\an1}So I think we should order
one of everything on the menu.

36:15.706 --> 36:16.641
Yeah, I think order...

36:16.707 --> 36:17.775
{\an1}(Brooke)
Okay.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.243

37:58.476 --> 38:00.277

38:07.218 --> 38:10.454
Now, I didn't know it led

38:13.324 --> 38:16.027

38:53.864 --> 38:57.501
This is becoming quite
the uncomfortable space.

39:03.207 --> 39:05.509
Oh, my God.

39:05.576 --> 39:08.846
You know what? I have
absolutely nothing to hide.

39:08.913 --> 39:11.749
So if Ray J wants to hold court
with Safaree here today,

39:11.816 --> 39:14.418
I am here to defend myself.
