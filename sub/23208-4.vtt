00:31.809 --> 00:33.769
I'm back.

00:37.969 --> 00:39.769
You were a long time.

00:39.769 --> 00:41.289
It's market day.

00:42.849 --> 00:44.329
It was busy.

PHONE RINGS

01:00.569 --> 01:01.609
Hello?

01:08.449 --> 01:11.129
- Who was that?
- I don't know, they hung up.

01:14.449 --> 01:17.969
Is that the one Cil and Dave bought you for Christmas?

01:17.969 --> 01:21.809
Mm, yeah, it's a mystery puzzle.

01:21.809 --> 01:23.209
Murder on the Green.

01:24.169 --> 01:26.089
There's a booklet which sets out the story,

01:26.089 --> 01:30.689
but the picture on the box bears no resemblance to the actual jigsaw,

01:30.689 --> 01:34.209
so...you're working in the dark, to some extent.

01:35.809 --> 01:36.849
Quite a challenge.

01:38.889 --> 01:40.329
Sounds like fun.

01:43.689 --> 01:45.249
Well, I enjoy it.

01:47.089 --> 01:49.969
I got your Pot Noodles, do you want them downstairs?

01:49.969 --> 01:52.609
Oh, no, just leave them there, thank you.

01:52.609 --> 01:54.689
I don't know why you like these.

01:54.689 --> 01:57.129
Well, they're easy for when I'm working.

01:59.809 --> 02:01.689
Are you working this weekend?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.609
Yes, St Margaret's, I think.

02:15.649 --> 02:20.849
So I wrote my vows last night for the renewal ceremony.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.009
- Oh, yes?
- Yeah.

02:25.769 --> 02:28.209
Would you like to hear them?

02:28.209 --> 02:31.129
OK, fine. I was stuck on this bunker anyhow.

02:36.849 --> 02:38.249
Lend me your readers.

02:45.969 --> 02:52.649
Adrian, today I give to you a new affirmation of love from the heart

02:52.649 --> 02:55.089
that has adored you for 20 years,

02:55.089 --> 02:58.809
and will love you for as many more as God allots to it.

02:58.809 --> 03:01.769
- Oh, I think that's...
- We have been through a lot together

03:01.769 --> 03:03.729
and, through all those times,

03:03.729 --> 03:07.169
I can honestly say I loved you every step of the way.

03:08.129 --> 03:11.049
I hope you will say I do,

03:11.049 --> 03:15.169
and we can enjoy 20 more passionate and loving years together.

03:17.569 --> 03:20.089
- What do you think?
- Yeah, it's great.

03:20.089 --> 03:21.329
A tiny bit long...

03:21.329 --> 03:24.169
- What d'you mean?
- No, it's perfect, thank you.

03:25.769 --> 03:27.569
Well, you need to get on and write yours,

03:27.569 --> 03:29.209
I don't want you making it up on the day.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.809
Oh, I've already done it.

03:30.809 --> 03:33.169
Really? Can I hear it?

03:33.169 --> 03:38.569
- Why?
- Because I don't want to be surprised, ruin my Â£200 make-up.

03:38.569 --> 03:41.569
- How much?!
- Just read it to me, please.

03:43.409 --> 03:44.489
OK.

03:46.049 --> 03:47.569
Right. "I, insert name," -

03:47.569 --> 03:50.969
presumably that's my name, so that's Adrian, obviously -

03:50.969 --> 03:54.649
"I declare that I know of no legal reason why we may not

03:54.649 --> 03:55.889
"register as partners.

03:55.889 --> 03:58.329
"I understand that, on signing this document, we will be

03:58.329 --> 04:00.449
"forming a civil partnership with each other."

04:04.809 --> 04:07.809
- Civil partnership?
- Yeah. Is that not right?

04:07.809 --> 04:11.209
- I took it from a website.
- What website, lesbianweddings.com?

04:11.209 --> 04:12.649
Does it really matter, Harrie?

04:14.969 --> 04:19.249
You know that I love you, and I know that you love me.

04:20.409 --> 04:23.129
There's no need to spend a fortune on a party to prove it.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.569
We don't have to invite anybody, it's not about that.

04:25.569 --> 04:28.129
I'd be happy doing it with just me and you

04:28.129 --> 04:30.129
and a ring pull from a can of diet Pepsi.

04:30.129 --> 04:33.049
They don't do ring pulls any more, for health and safety reasons.

04:33.049 --> 04:34.529
You know what I mean.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.929
You spend all that time downstairs,

04:37.929 --> 04:40.329
working on other people's wedding photos,

04:41.529 --> 04:46.289
touching them up, making them look perfect and shiny and new.

04:48.009 --> 04:50.049
That's what I want for us, for our marriage.

04:50.049 --> 04:51.889
I want us to be...

04:51.889 --> 04:53.889
- Touched up?
- Frankly, I do.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.369
We haven't...

04:59.889 --> 05:00.929
Yes, well...

05:06.129 --> 05:08.849
I will give it some proper thought, I promise.

05:08.849 --> 05:11.049
PHONE RINGS

05:11.049 --> 05:12.089
I'll get that.

05:15.689 --> 05:17.289
Hello? No.

05:25.049 --> 05:27.009
Wrong number again.

05:39.889 --> 05:41.169
Adrian?

06:15.369 --> 06:17.209
What are you doing up?

06:18.249 --> 06:21.249
Looking for you. It's three in the morning.

06:21.249 --> 06:24.609
- I had a bad dream.
- What, John Prescott and the Creme Eggs again?

06:24.609 --> 06:26.849
No, that was just when I was doing the Atkins.

06:26.849 --> 06:29.609
I wish you wouldn't go through my stuff.

06:31.169 --> 06:34.009
- So how bad is it?
- Well, you can see for yourself,

06:34.009 --> 06:36.449
we are behind with the mortgage, all the bills are red.

06:36.449 --> 06:38.729
Well, everything's red down here, darling.

06:38.729 --> 06:39.969
It's not funny, Harrie.

06:41.769 --> 06:45.569
I'm supposed to be the provider and that's another thing I failed at.

06:45.569 --> 06:47.249
What do you mean?

06:47.249 --> 06:49.249
Your frozen eggs.

06:50.289 --> 06:52.089
My weak sperm.

06:53.169 --> 06:55.409
Rachel, if it had been a girl, Levi for a boy.

06:59.129 --> 07:01.089
I never would have allowed Levi.

07:01.089 --> 07:02.969
It's a good Biblical name.

07:02.969 --> 07:05.689
That's as may be, but people think of jeans.

07:08.449 --> 07:11.089
I think I'll have to give up the photography and get another job.

07:11.089 --> 07:12.809
No, you mustn't do that.

07:12.809 --> 07:15.009
We'll move, we'll get a...

07:15.009 --> 07:17.169
- smaller house.
- No.

07:17.169 --> 07:19.569
- I don't mind.
- I'm not making you leave this house.

07:24.409 --> 07:25.929
I could always...

07:30.049 --> 07:31.649
I could go back to Osborne's.

07:34.609 --> 07:36.249
Mm, it's a possibility.

07:36.249 --> 07:37.969
Could you turn the light off, please?

07:50.569 --> 07:52.649
Does he still work there?

07:54.129 --> 07:55.849
I'm not sure.

07:55.849 --> 07:58.609
I, I think he's got a new position.

07:58.609 --> 08:01.009
Yes, I remember you telling me.

08:01.009 --> 08:03.529
- I meant in the company.
- Yeah, I know what you meant.

08:06.729 --> 08:08.209
You'd have to trust me, Adrian.

08:09.329 --> 08:11.209
I always did,

08:11.209 --> 08:13.449
"forsaking all others", remember?

08:15.569 --> 08:17.249
You were very absent at the time.

08:19.369 --> 08:21.129
You were off playing happy families

08:21.129 --> 08:23.049
with a different couple every weekend.

08:23.049 --> 08:25.889
It was my job. You make me sound like a swinger.

08:25.889 --> 08:28.009
Well, you were very flirtatious with the women.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.089
Oh, to get good pictures out of them, that's all.

08:30.089 --> 08:31.929
- What about Agnes?
- Who?

08:31.929 --> 08:33.529
Our cleaner.

08:33.529 --> 08:36.529
- She left because you were coming on to her.
- I wasn't coming on to her,

08:36.529 --> 08:39.089
I was trying to get her to clean under the toilet rim.

08:39.089 --> 08:41.649
Besides, there's a difference between flirting with someone

08:41.649 --> 08:44.369
and sucking them off in the Wolverhampton Ibis.

08:44.369 --> 08:45.929
Once, Adrian, one time!

08:49.889 --> 08:51.129
And it was a Premier Inn.

08:52.569 --> 08:56.449
Look, we've been through this, I was very unhappy, and very...

08:57.489 --> 09:01.849
..isolated, and I made a huge mistake and I am so, so sorry.

09:01.849 --> 09:02.889
Please.

09:06.449 --> 09:08.849
So that's what all these phone calls have been about, is it?

09:11.449 --> 09:13.049
You're back in contact?

09:14.249 --> 09:15.769
Only with Sue.

09:19.329 --> 09:21.089
Only with Sue.

09:29.689 --> 09:32.209
- You followed me.
- 20 years, Harrie.

09:32.209 --> 09:36.569
It was just about work, I swear, I knew we needed the money...

09:36.569 --> 09:40.049
I see, so that's why you wanted to renew your precious vows, was it?

09:40.049 --> 09:42.289
- You have to believe me!
- Give yourself a clean slate?
- No!

09:49.969 --> 09:52.969
I love you, Adrian. I do.

09:54.889 --> 09:56.609
But you won't let me in.

09:57.769 --> 09:59.089
I'm sorry.

10:04.209 --> 10:05.569
Come to bed.

10:07.809 --> 10:11.289
OK, I'd better clean this up first, I won't be long.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.849
Careful.

10:28.489 --> 10:29.529
Mr...

10:30.489 --> 10:32.409
..Shafter?

10:32.409 --> 10:33.449
Yes.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.009
Dick Shafter?

10:37.129 --> 10:39.969
- That's right.
- If you'd like to follow me?

10:54.249 --> 10:57.489
I'm Nurse Honeypot, and I'll be taking care of you today.

11:01.089 --> 11:02.489
How's your temperature?

11:02.489 --> 11:04.169
Fine at the moment.

11:05.449 --> 11:07.529
But I am getting a little bit hot.

11:09.009 --> 11:10.129
Let's just loosen this.

11:26.009 --> 11:27.569
It's a new shirt, shall I, shall I do it?

11:27.569 --> 11:29.089
Yeah.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.129
Sorry.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.529
- Have you been drinking?
- Just a glass.

11:34.969 --> 11:36.609
Come on,

11:36.609 --> 11:39.689
take your trousers off, and we'll see what happens

11:39.689 --> 11:40.849
if we apply some oil.

11:50.849 --> 11:52.529
Careful, Harrie, it's going everywhere!

11:52.529 --> 11:55.529
- It doesn't matter.
- Yeah, but you say that, but it's going to stain.

11:55.529 --> 11:57.089
Just let me quickly get a wet cloth.

11:57.089 --> 11:59.329
Leave it, Adrian, it's all right, sit down!

12:10.089 --> 12:13.169
I've got a feeling you're not very comfortable doing this.

12:13.169 --> 12:16.529
I am, it's just awkward, I can't think of anything to say.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.889
You don't have do, it's not Whose Line Is It Anyway.

12:18.889 --> 12:20.289
Just...

12:20.289 --> 12:21.609
relax.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.529
- Do you want a cushion for your...
- Yeah.
- ..knees?

12:32.889 --> 12:34.049
Shoe's come off.

12:38.329 --> 12:39.889
OK.

13:09.969 --> 13:11.609
How's that?

13:11.609 --> 13:13.529
Is that nice?

13:13.529 --> 13:15.529
Yes.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.209
Good.

13:17.209 --> 13:20.049
Let Nurse Honeypot use her magic fingers.

13:46.809 --> 13:48.249
I'm sorry.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.689
It's all right.

13:57.409 --> 13:59.369
Shall we go upstairs?

13:59.369 --> 14:00.529
No.

14:02.249 --> 14:04.369
Would you like to take a shower together?

14:04.369 --> 14:05.889
Not really.

14:07.649 --> 14:11.249
- What do you want to do?
- It's not you, it's me. I just, I can't.

14:12.209 --> 14:13.769
Oh, fine.

14:20.769 --> 14:23.729
It's really good of you to suggest all these things, Harrie, but...

14:26.169 --> 14:27.769
..I think I'm a bit old for role-play.

14:30.649 --> 14:32.809
Well, what do you like, Adrian?

14:32.809 --> 14:34.249
And what is this?

14:34.249 --> 14:38.009
I haven't died yet, I want us to do things together,

14:38.009 --> 14:39.689
while we still can.

14:41.489 --> 14:42.849
DOORBELL

14:48.329 --> 14:50.729
Oh, shit! I totally forgot,

14:50.729 --> 14:53.129
I've got a couple coming to look at their wedding pictures.

14:53.129 --> 14:54.889
- Ah, saved by the bell, eh?
- What d'you mean?

14:54.889 --> 14:57.729
You knew full well they were coming round, you had it totally planned!

14:57.729 --> 14:59.689
Course I didn't! Now, please, go and get changed.

15:01.769 --> 15:04.369
- Hello! Hi, Max. Hi, Hannah.
- Hello.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.849
Nice to see you again.

15:07.289 --> 15:09.569
Come through, I'll just go and get your contact sheets.

15:09.569 --> 15:13.289
Aha. Oh, hello, I'm Max, this is Hannah.

15:13.289 --> 15:15.449
- Hello, there.
- Ah, the happy couple.

15:15.449 --> 15:17.609
Hmm. Would you like a drink?

15:17.609 --> 15:22.489
Er, no, thank you, a bit early for us.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.209
I just got back in from work.

15:24.209 --> 15:25.329
Oh.

15:26.849 --> 15:28.809
Are you a nurse, by any chance?

15:28.809 --> 15:30.729
I work in a mortuary.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.409
- Oh...
- I handle corpses.

15:33.409 --> 15:35.529
Isn't that right, Adrian?

15:35.529 --> 15:38.609
Here we are, then, if you'd like to take a seat.

15:38.609 --> 15:40.449
It was a lovely day, I seem to remember.

15:40.449 --> 15:43.569
- It was, we were very lucky with the weather, weren't we?
- We were.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.289
- Where did you get married?
- BOTH: St Margaret's.

15:47.289 --> 15:49.289
Oh, that's nice.

15:49.289 --> 15:52.129
We just did a boring registry office, didn't we?

15:52.129 --> 15:55.209
Yeah, it's called a register office, and I wouldn't say it was boring.

15:55.209 --> 15:57.329
I wanted to renew our vows.

15:57.329 --> 15:59.809
- 20 years.
- Oh, wow, well, we've managed 20 days.

15:59.809 --> 16:01.249
They said it wouldn't last, so...!

16:01.249 --> 16:04.009
It turns out we couldn't afford it, though, could we, Adrian?

16:05.089 --> 16:08.329
I shot a couple of rolls of colour, but mainly black and white.

16:08.329 --> 16:09.369
Oh.

16:10.369 --> 16:12.689
Oh, that's amazing of the doves, look at the wings.

16:12.689 --> 16:13.889
Oh, yes!

16:13.889 --> 16:17.289
- Very artistic.
- I wanted doves, but Adrian said he was allergic.

16:17.289 --> 16:18.609
No, I didn't.

16:19.809 --> 16:22.489
Two grey pigeons, we had, outside a council building.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.729
Well, they're really good.

16:28.729 --> 16:31.489
Yeah. He's great with other people's marriages. The best.

16:31.489 --> 16:33.569
Why don't we leave you to look at these in peace?

16:33.569 --> 16:35.409
- Come on, Harrie.
- Oh, now you want to touch me?

16:35.409 --> 16:36.969
Stop it!

16:40.969 --> 16:43.009
Is there any way we could look at these, um...

16:44.249 --> 16:45.849
Take them home and look at them, maybe?

16:45.849 --> 16:47.569
Yes, that's probably best, isn't it?

16:47.569 --> 16:50.809
I'll scan them onto a memory stick for you and drop it round.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.609
Thanks, that, er... We'll speak soon.

16:57.409 --> 16:58.889
Nice to meet you.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.129
You've got a lovely house.

17:03.169 --> 17:05.368
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right, we'll speak soon.

17:05.368 --> 17:07.089
OK. Nice to see you, bye.

17:09.689 --> 17:11.648
For God's sake, Harrie, they're clients!

17:11.648 --> 17:15.489
I'm your wife! I bet you'd like to put me on a memory stick.

17:15.489 --> 17:18.409
- What does that even mean?
- I'm going upstairs, alone, as per.

17:20.969 --> 17:22.329
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Huh!

17:22.329 --> 17:24.049
Chance'd be a fine thing!

19:08.689 --> 19:10.049
I made you a beef and tomato.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.889
CHAIN CLINKS

19:20.129 --> 19:22.289
Try not to spill it.

19:30.449 --> 19:33.809
Mm, so, which one shall I open first?

19:34.809 --> 19:38.649
- This one.
- Mm, I think I can guess what this is,

19:38.649 --> 19:39.969
unless I've just broken it.

19:42.369 --> 19:43.409
Oh, wow!

19:44.449 --> 19:46.969
Flying Scotsman, I am going to be a busy boy.

19:46.969 --> 19:49.369
I wanted to get you one of those mats where you roll it all up

19:49.369 --> 19:51.889
and you can take it with you, but they didn't have any in stock.

19:51.889 --> 19:53.889
Oh, never mind. We never go anywhere, do we?

19:53.889 --> 19:55.729
As you're always telling me.

19:55.729 --> 19:58.569
No, no, it's super, thanks, darling.

19:58.569 --> 20:01.169
I thought we could do this one together,

20:01.169 --> 20:02.929
seeing how it's so big.

20:02.929 --> 20:05.409
Oh, God, I've dragged you down to my level, have I?

20:05.409 --> 20:08.129
No, I genuinely want to, honestly.

20:15.489 --> 20:16.689
What next?

20:18.249 --> 20:19.289
Here.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.049
- This is just a joke.
- OK...

20:25.329 --> 20:28.489
Oh, ho, ho, Bombay Bad Boy!

20:28.489 --> 20:31.009
I've not tried one of these, I'll have that later, thank you.

20:32.089 --> 20:33.889
This is your main present.

20:35.049 --> 20:38.889
- Hope you'll like it.
- Mm, good things come in small packages.

20:38.889 --> 20:39.929
It's not a bill, is it?!

20:42.529 --> 20:44.129
- What's this?
- A trip to Paris.

20:45.769 --> 20:48.729
- Paris?
- Yes, only for a week, six nights.

20:48.729 --> 20:51.289
I just thought it'd be really good for us to get away.

20:51.289 --> 20:56.049
Something different. The City of Light.

20:56.049 --> 20:57.249
I see.

20:59.169 --> 21:01.969
How long ago did you build that darkroom of yours?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.369
- Eight years?
- Nine.

21:04.369 --> 21:05.769
Exactly.

21:06.729 --> 21:08.489
It's about time you came up for air.

21:09.729 --> 21:12.129
I've missed you.

21:12.129 --> 21:14.769
- So when are we going?
- This afternoon.

21:14.769 --> 21:16.489
I've booked a taxi.

21:17.489 --> 21:20.129
My God, you're very good at keeping secrets, aren't you?

21:20.129 --> 21:21.489
You're not mad?

21:21.489 --> 21:24.209
No, no, no, but what about your work?

21:24.209 --> 21:26.889
- They'd never let you have the time off.
- No, they were fine about it.

21:26.889 --> 21:28.449
I did have to...

21:28.449 --> 21:31.609
run it by you-know-who, but he couldn't really say no, could he?

21:33.129 --> 21:35.089
No, I suppose not.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.689
Six nights.

21:38.929 --> 21:41.329
Right, well, I'd better go and sort some things out.

21:41.329 --> 21:43.009
I don't even know where my passport is.

21:43.009 --> 21:44.609
It's all right, I found it downstairs.

21:44.609 --> 21:46.929
- What d'you mean?
- It was just in a drawer.

21:46.929 --> 21:48.969
Don't worry about it, everything's sorted!

21:50.969 --> 21:53.809
And I've got my mum and dad coming to house sit while we're away.

21:53.809 --> 21:55.929
What?! No, no, you can't!

21:55.929 --> 21:58.529
Someone's got to water the plants, haven't they?

21:58.529 --> 22:00.769
You don't want to come home and find everything dead.

22:00.769 --> 22:02.409
Shit, shit, shit!

22:09.249 --> 22:10.729
You haven't seen my keys, have you?

22:10.729 --> 22:13.209
- What?
- Keys! My darkroom keys!

22:13.209 --> 22:17.769
What about the counter? In the kitchen?

22:23.729 --> 22:26.049
I thought we could go and visit those catacombs.

22:26.049 --> 22:28.969
You've always wanted to see them, haven't you?

22:30.489 --> 22:31.969
Did you get any insurance?

22:31.969 --> 22:36.009
- What?
- For the trip, in case one of us has an accident?

22:36.009 --> 22:38.889
Yes, it's all sorted!

22:38.889 --> 22:41.249
Stop worrying, it's your birthday!

22:52.009 --> 22:54.049
- THUDDING
- Adrian?

22:55.049 --> 22:56.409
You all right?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.529
Adrian!

23:00.529 --> 23:02.049
Oh, my God!

23:03.769 --> 23:04.809
Sorry...

23:05.889 --> 23:08.209
Adrian, stay with me.

23:08.209 --> 23:09.249
Stay with me!

23:16.809 --> 23:18.329
Sorry.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.089
- WOMAN:
- No, you'd better come through.

23:41.089 --> 23:43.809
- MUFFLED:
- Mrs Connor's still here.

23:48.729 --> 23:50.049
Er, hello, um...

23:51.089 --> 23:52.489
I don't know if you remember us.

23:52.489 --> 23:54.689
I'm Max, this is Hannah, we came round.

23:54.689 --> 23:56.369
Your husband did our wedding photos.

23:56.369 --> 23:57.729
Yes, I remember.

24:03.409 --> 24:07.129
Is he in? We wanted to thank him for doing our photos, and, um,

24:07.129 --> 24:09.449
we got him this. I don't know if he likes champagne?

24:14.849 --> 24:16.809
Um,

24:16.809 --> 24:19.929
I'm sorry to have to tell you this...

24:19.929 --> 24:21.249
but...

24:22.209 --> 24:23.689
..Adrian died.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.609
What?

24:26.609 --> 24:28.769
Yes, about four months ago.

24:32.169 --> 24:34.769
Oh, my God, um, I'm so sorry.

24:34.769 --> 24:36.489
It was a sudden thing.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.889
He had an accident, fell down the stairs.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.729
Oh, well, we should go.

24:45.729 --> 24:48.929
Yeah, um, I don't know if you want this now,

24:48.929 --> 24:50.369
but we'll leave it, anyway.

24:52.489 --> 24:54.009
Thank you.

24:54.009 --> 24:56.449
- One thing we were going to mention...
- Max, not now!

24:56.449 --> 24:58.849
- Well, whilst we're here...
- It's fine, I don't mind.

24:58.849 --> 25:00.009
- What is it?
- Well,

25:00.009 --> 25:02.249
it's just that we've been looking at houses in this area,

25:02.249 --> 25:04.489
- and Hannah took a real shine to this one.
- Don't blame me!

25:04.489 --> 25:07.169
Well, you did, we both did, and we just wanted to say,

25:07.169 --> 25:09.449
if you were ever thinking of selling,

25:09.449 --> 25:11.609
would you please let us know first?

25:14.129 --> 25:16.289
But don't feel you have to on our account.

25:16.289 --> 25:18.809
We're very happy for you to stay as long as you like, aren't we?

25:18.809 --> 25:20.609
Yeah, yeah, take your time.

25:20.609 --> 25:23.009
Thank you, that's very kind of you.

25:25.169 --> 25:27.609
To be honest, I can't think about moving at the moment,

25:27.609 --> 25:29.049
but do leave me your number.

25:29.049 --> 25:31.369
OK, I'll just...

25:35.329 --> 25:36.969
I'll give you my e-mail, as well?

25:39.049 --> 25:40.689
I'm so sorry.

25:49.249 --> 25:51.209
- We'll see ourselves out.
- Yeah.

25:55.369 --> 25:57.449
I wonder what's down there.

25:57.449 --> 25:59.369
Max! It's not our house yet!

25:59.369 --> 26:01.369
We could build a home cinema.

26:01.369 --> 26:03.169
No, it's going to be a gym!

26:06.849 --> 26:08.769
Can I clean in here now?

26:08.769 --> 26:10.649
Yes.

26:10.649 --> 26:11.689
Thank you, Agnes.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.449
You don't have to do this, you know?

26:18.409 --> 26:20.649
I want to, at least for now.

26:22.889 --> 26:24.369
Is everything OK, Mrs Connor?

26:26.089 --> 26:27.209
No, not really.

26:28.209 --> 26:30.009
I still can't get my head around...

26:32.409 --> 26:37.049
If I hadn't booked that trip, if Adrian hadn't fallen...

26:38.969 --> 26:41.009
..I never would have found you.

26:41.009 --> 26:42.969
I know.

26:44.049 --> 26:48.449
He told me he'd sacked you, and you just left.

26:48.449 --> 26:51.369
I remember it like it was yesterday.

26:51.369 --> 26:54.009
It was not yesterday. It was nine years.

26:59.129 --> 27:02.689
I'm so sorry, Agnes.

27:03.849 --> 27:06.809
I thought I was living with the most boring man in the world.

27:08.369 --> 27:09.689
Turns out he was a monster.

27:12.529 --> 27:14.209
You saved us, Mrs Connor.

27:14.209 --> 27:15.489
That's all that matters.

I couldn't do that, Agnes.
