WEBVTT

01:26.872 --> 01:28.705
Yes, Mr. Burnish,

01:28.707 --> 01:30.807
the venue
is completely sold out.

01:30.809 --> 01:33.076
This is the most important
discovery of the century,

01:33.078 --> 01:34.945
and everyone wants to see it.

01:34.947 --> 01:36.846
Yes, the press will be there.

01:36.848 --> 01:38.782
This is your big day,
Mr. Burnish.

01:38.784 --> 01:40.717
You won't be disappointed. I promise.

01:42.087 --> 01:44.888
Easy. Easy, boy.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.923
Code Red!

01:46.925 --> 01:49.659
Who left the enclosure open?

01:49.661 --> 01:51.962
Stay back!

02:15.554 --> 02:18.757
All right, move in slowly.

02:21.593 --> 02:23.893
No sudden movements.

02:29.034 --> 02:30.100
What's happening?

02:32.037 --> 02:33.837
Oh!

02:35.574 --> 02:37.140
- Whoa!
- Oh!

02:42.080 --> 02:43.947
Um...

02:43.949 --> 02:46.084
who's telling Mr. Burnish?

04:12.137 --> 04:14.003
On your right.

04:14.005 --> 04:16.239
- Hey, want to shoot some hoops?
- Maybe later.

04:16.241 --> 04:18.041
- Number two, extra spicy.
- <i>Xie xie.</i>

04:18.043 --> 04:20.076
Nah. Nah,
I'm going out with Peilin,

04:20.078 --> 04:22.178
but, uh...
eh, maybe I'll stop by.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.148
Aw, it would be
so fun if you could come.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.184
Yi!

04:28.186 --> 04:29.886
I'm leaving for work.

04:29.888 --> 04:31.022
Yi?

04:32.124 --> 04:34.258
Are you awake?

04:34.260 --> 04:36.895
Bye, everybody.
Have a great day.

04:38.264 --> 04:41.030
Eh. What are you
supposed to be?

04:41.032 --> 04:43.032
A famous person now?

04:43.034 --> 04:44.901
Uh, where are you going?

04:44.903 --> 04:46.270
I've got stuff to do.

04:46.272 --> 04:48.238
Stuff? What is this stuff?

04:48.240 --> 04:49.939
It's summer holiday.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.075
Either be busy,
or be on holiday.

04:52.077 --> 04:53.710
That is what I say.

04:53.712 --> 04:55.044
- Be careful out there.
- Of course.

04:55.046 --> 04:56.246
Be back before dinner.

04:56.248 --> 04:57.281
- I'll try.
- Warm enough?

04:57.283 --> 04:58.948
- Toasty.
- No boys.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.318
- What? No, no boys.
- Do you need any money?

05:01.320 --> 05:04.255
Mom, Nai Nai,
I've got it covered.

05:04.257 --> 05:05.955
Bye.

05:08.827 --> 05:10.327
Okay. Bye.

05:10.329 --> 05:13.029
What on earth do you think
she does all day?

05:14.333 --> 05:16.300
Whoa! Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

05:16.302 --> 05:17.934
- Heel.
- Hey!

05:17.936 --> 05:19.202
- Would you guys give me a break?
- Hey!

05:19.204 --> 05:21.505
Whoa, whoa!

05:23.975 --> 05:26.075
Oh, my babies.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.278
Money transfer?

05:27.280 --> 05:29.245
Sorry. It's cash only.

05:34.819 --> 05:36.986
We'll be back in a few hours.

05:36.988 --> 05:39.292
- Hey, cutie.
- You're not my mom!

06:03.282 --> 06:06.149
So, Jin, are you
going to Shuo's this weekend?

06:06.151 --> 06:08.352
No. No, I'm heading to Beijing
to check out my school.

06:08.354 --> 06:10.987
- I'm, uh, premed.
- Nice.

06:10.989 --> 06:13.122
- Oh, med school?
- That's so hot.

06:13.124 --> 06:15.792
I know, right?

06:15.794 --> 06:17.994
Ugh. What's that...

06:17.996 --> 06:19.731
smell?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.133
She looks like she slept
in a dumpster.

06:26.871 --> 06:29.005
Selfie!

06:38.251 --> 06:40.116
He breaks left.
He breaks right.

06:40.118 --> 06:42.118
He's going in for the dunk!

06:42.120 --> 06:43.354
Whoa!

06:43.356 --> 06:44.921
Hey, Yi.

06:44.923 --> 06:47.156
Come shoot hoops with me.
Come on.

06:47.158 --> 06:49.260
Sorry, Peng.
I don't have time.

06:49.262 --> 06:51.027
Wh-Why don't you ask
the other kids?

06:51.029 --> 06:52.396
The other kids are too little.

06:52.398 --> 06:56.300
And some of them
are freakishly good.

06:56.302 --> 06:59.102
Come on, Yi, you never play
with me anymore.

06:59.104 --> 07:01.904
Peng, I've been busy all day.

07:01.906 --> 07:03.307
Hey, hey, your cousin
will play with you.

07:03.309 --> 07:04.974
Yeah, yeah,
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

07:04.976 --> 07:06.242
Light show starts at 8:00.

07:06.244 --> 07:08.077
Uh, buh-bye.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.013
As usual, he's got a date.

07:12.117 --> 07:14.451
Wait, wait. Yi, watch.

07:14.453 --> 07:15.852
Here we go.

07:15.854 --> 07:17.987
Three, two, one.

07:17.989 --> 07:21.057
Stop and check.

07:21.059 --> 07:23.059
Hey, Yi, you know
I can smell you

07:23.061 --> 07:24.994
from all the way
over here, right?

07:24.996 --> 07:26.162
Like you can talk.

07:26.164 --> 07:27.364
I'm sorry, is there any
aftershave left,

07:27.366 --> 07:29.032
or did you use
the whole bottle?

07:29.034 --> 07:30.900
Why?
You hoping to borrow some?

07:30.902 --> 07:33.903
- Oof, not sure it'll help.
- Very funny.

07:33.905 --> 07:36.340
You guys want to work out some
of this tension on the court?

07:36.342 --> 07:38.941
Forget it, Peng. We wouldn't
want to mess up Jin's hair.

07:38.943 --> 07:41.944
And the new kicks.
No basketball for these babies.

07:41.946 --> 07:44.013
Another time, okay, coz?

07:44.015 --> 07:46.115
That's what you always say.

07:46.117 --> 07:49.120
48 likes. Sweet!

07:51.357 --> 07:53.357
Don't.
I know what you're thinking,

07:53.359 --> 07:55.292
so just don't say it.

07:55.294 --> 07:58.127
She's never at home anymore.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.463
Ma.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.164
That's all I'm gonna say.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.468
Not another word.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.235
So, that's it?

08:06.237 --> 08:08.505
We're just going to
give up on her?

08:08.507 --> 08:11.040
I'd never give up on Yi.

08:11.042 --> 08:14.110
Look, we both know
what she's been going through.

08:14.112 --> 08:16.112
She misses her dad.

08:16.114 --> 08:17.980
We all do.

08:17.982 --> 08:21.385
If we're patient and don't
push her, then just maybe...

08:21.387 --> 08:23.454
Yi, is that you?

08:23.456 --> 08:25.988
We've been waiting
for you to eat.

08:25.990 --> 08:28.925
Oh, I-I ate on my way back,
so I'm good.

08:28.927 --> 08:32.262
Either eat here or there,
but never on the move.

08:32.264 --> 08:34.264
That is what I say.

08:34.266 --> 08:36.467
Hey, Yi,
why don't we all sit down

08:36.469 --> 08:38.435
together tonight as a family?

08:38.437 --> 08:40.537
Family.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.238
You need to eat.

08:42.240 --> 08:45.074
You don't want to be
so short like your mother.

08:45.076 --> 08:46.377
Oh, I'm-I'm okay.
Thank you, Nai Nai.

08:46.379 --> 08:48.077
Yi, wait.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.279
What would you say to playing

08:49.281 --> 08:51.080
a little violin for us
after supper?

08:51.082 --> 08:54.016
- Remember when you used to...
- I-I can't.

08:54.018 --> 08:55.452
Can't? Why?

08:55.454 --> 08:58.322
Uh, because I...

08:58.324 --> 09:01.291
I-I sold it.

09:01.293 --> 09:04.195
I, uh... I'm sorry.

09:08.734 --> 09:12.101
No.

09:57.583 --> 10:01.387
I will take this trip.

10:11.029 --> 10:13.031
Someday.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.200
Okay.

12:05.344 --> 12:07.313
Okay.

12:24.496 --> 12:27.231
No, no, no, no.

12:42.781 --> 12:44.213
Huh?

13:06.572 --> 13:09.441
Hold up. Spotted something
at two o'clock.

13:11.644 --> 13:13.343
There's nothing there.

13:13.345 --> 13:15.146
Moving on.

14:19.578 --> 14:21.380
Oh.

14:31.490 --> 14:33.525
Hi, Mom.
Bye, Nai Nai.

14:35.394 --> 14:38.328
Excuse me.

14:42.634 --> 14:45.402
Bam! It came out of nowhere.

14:45.404 --> 14:47.506
Then it was gone.

14:49.374 --> 14:50.841
Did you see where it went?

14:50.843 --> 14:53.710
Lady, I just told you.
It was gone.

14:53.712 --> 14:55.746
What, uh... what was it anyway?

14:55.748 --> 14:59.485
Um, let me take care
of the repairs to your truck.

15:02.554 --> 15:04.821
A little compensation
for your silence.

15:04.823 --> 15:06.425
It's a bribe.

15:28.914 --> 15:30.914
Nai Nai, that's weird.

15:30.916 --> 15:34.417
- Oh, so you're hungry now, hmm?
- Oh, yeah.

15:34.419 --> 15:35.819
Starving.

15:35.821 --> 15:38.522
Let them cool.
You'll burn your mouth.

15:38.524 --> 15:39.856
I keep telling your mother

15:39.858 --> 15:42.425
- you need to slow down.
- Ow! Ow!

15:42.427 --> 15:45.128
- Spend more time here, at home with your family.
- Ow.

15:45.130 --> 15:47.130
- Ow.
- Mrs. Lui called me today.

15:47.132 --> 15:50.133
Says you're fixing
her computer.

15:50.135 --> 15:52.836
And Mrs. Yuan in 4-B says

15:52.838 --> 15:55.672
you're going to trim
her poodle's toenails.

15:55.674 --> 15:57.774
I like that you're ambitious.

15:57.776 --> 16:00.744
No one wants
a lazy granddaughter.

16:00.746 --> 16:02.813
But, uh, busy, busy, busy.

16:02.815 --> 16:05.582
What do you need to do
all that for?

16:05.584 --> 16:07.450
I guess I just like being busy.

16:07.452 --> 16:08.718
Yi.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.854
Can we just talk
about this later, Nai Nai?

16:10.856 --> 16:12.689
You don't have to worry.

16:12.691 --> 16:14.724
You should listen to Nai Nai!

16:31.510 --> 16:33.579
Hey, boy.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.513
Or girl.

16:36.515 --> 16:38.415
Are you hungry?

16:38.417 --> 16:39.983
Whoa!

16:47.759 --> 16:50.762
Hoo!
Yeah, you're definitely a boy.

17:56.028 --> 17:58.764
Whoa.

18:05.604 --> 18:07.271
I don't know
where you came from,

18:07.273 --> 18:10.642
but you...
sure don't belong here.

18:15.647 --> 18:16.846
You stay in here, okay?

18:16.848 --> 18:19.451
There-there are people
looking for you.

18:21.987 --> 18:24.521
Hmm.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.600
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay. Okay.

19:11.703 --> 19:13.505
No. Please don't cry.

19:17.609 --> 19:19.009
Wait.

19:25.117 --> 19:27.117
My dad used to play for me.

19:27.119 --> 19:29.821
It always made me feel better.

20:12.398 --> 20:14.966
All better, right?

20:25.944 --> 20:27.411
Uh...

20:27.413 --> 20:28.978
The...

20:30.649 --> 20:33.149
Nah.

20:33.151 --> 20:36.186
Good night, sleepyhead.

20:49.201 --> 20:50.900
Wait.

20:50.902 --> 20:52.836
Do you know that place?

20:57.008 --> 20:59.742
Is that... is that your home?

21:01.447 --> 21:03.847
You know, uh, um, home.

21:12.124 --> 21:14.157
No way.

21:14.159 --> 21:16.293
Okay.

21:16.295 --> 21:18.027
Come on.

21:18.029 --> 21:20.464
Creature from Mount Everest.

21:20.466 --> 21:22.966
"Considered to be no more
than fairy tale and myth,

21:22.968 --> 21:24.234
"enthusiasts still
hold out hope

21:24.236 --> 21:27.471
that these creatures
actually do exist."

21:31.176 --> 21:33.843
There's a yeti on my roof.

21:36.248 --> 21:38.948
Captain, I am holding
you personally responsible

21:38.950 --> 21:42.018
for that abominable
creature's escape.

21:42.020 --> 21:45.922
Now, you will get every car
we have out there,

21:45.924 --> 21:49.859
or I will send you back to
your job at the shopping mall.

21:49.861 --> 21:51.194
Uh, yes, sir. Understood.

21:51.196 --> 21:52.795
Attention, all units.

21:52.797 --> 21:54.933
We need every car
out on the street.

22:56.161 --> 22:58.262
I was dribbling,
and the guy was like, "Oh, no,"

22:58.264 --> 23:00.264
and I was like, "Oh, yeah."

23:00.266 --> 23:01.831
Want to play a game?

23:01.833 --> 23:03.267
I can't.
Nai Nai will, though.

23:03.269 --> 23:05.868
Hey, Nai Nai,
want to shoot some hoops?

23:05.870 --> 23:09.005
You know I only play for money.

23:09.007 --> 23:11.910
Uh, something's missing.

23:13.011 --> 23:14.378
What in the...?

23:14.380 --> 23:16.079
Peng, go get your cousin Jin

23:16.081 --> 23:18.948
and see who stole
my air conditioner.

23:18.950 --> 23:21.287
Go. Go, go, go, go.

23:22.854 --> 23:25.422
Hey. Uh, what are you
doing out here?

23:25.424 --> 23:27.391
Someone's gonna see you.

23:27.393 --> 23:29.993
Where did you get that?
No, no, no, no, no.

23:29.995 --> 23:31.595
Give it back now!

23:33.299 --> 23:35.399
Do you hear me? Let go!

23:35.401 --> 23:37.100
Peng, that does not make sense.

23:37.102 --> 23:39.168
Why would they take it
to the roof?

23:41.039 --> 23:42.105
Oh!

23:42.107 --> 23:44.275
- Guys, what are you doing up here?
- Hey! Uh, hey!

23:44.277 --> 23:46.277
- Get away from her!
- No. No, no, no, wait.

23:46.279 --> 23:48.044
Okay, I'm calling the police.
Hello? Hello?

23:48.046 --> 23:49.613
- No. Jin, don't.
- Yes, uh, there's a...

23:49.615 --> 23:51.615
- there's a wild beast on our roof.
- Hang up, Jin.

23:51.617 --> 23:53.049
- No, no. Stop, Jin.
- Yes. Um...

23:53.051 --> 23:54.150
...a wild beast.

23:54.152 --> 23:55.918
- Turn up that scanner.
- Yeah, yeah, on Heping Road.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.854
- Please hurry.
- That's him.

23:57.856 --> 23:59.623
That's the yeti.
Ring Mr. Burnish.

23:59.625 --> 24:02.326
Jin, what have you done?
He's not dangerous.

24:05.063 --> 24:06.463
Look at him. He's a yeti.

24:06.465 --> 24:08.399
- Cool.
- What?

24:08.401 --> 24:11.000
No, y-yetis don't exist.

24:11.002 --> 24:13.102
Oh, no.

24:13.104 --> 24:14.373
They're back!

24:15.641 --> 24:17.641
You have to go.

24:17.643 --> 24:19.008
Go. Run. Now.

24:19.010 --> 24:20.078
Go.

24:23.382 --> 24:25.948
Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

24:25.950 --> 24:28.951
No. No, no.

24:36.662 --> 24:38.295
Wait.

24:38.297 --> 24:39.929
Yi!

24:41.132 --> 24:42.965
He stole Yi.

24:42.967 --> 24:45.371
More like kidnapped.

24:46.439 --> 24:48.372
Come on, Peng.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.913
Yi!

24:58.249 --> 24:59.949
We're never gonna
catch up to them.

24:59.951 --> 25:01.918
Hey, Jin.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.487
Hey, girls.

25:03.489 --> 25:04.987
Whoo!

25:04.989 --> 25:06.490
How many girlfriends
do you have?

25:11.963 --> 25:13.497
Hurry!

25:13.499 --> 25:15.299
Whoa!

25:15.301 --> 25:17.001
Whoa, whoa.

25:21.273 --> 25:23.275
They're gaining on us.

25:26.712 --> 25:29.045
Locked on target.

25:30.449 --> 25:33.149
Dude, you darted Dave.

25:33.151 --> 25:36.353
Uh, yeah, we lost them.

25:36.355 --> 25:38.389
I want eyes on that target
at all times.

25:38.391 --> 25:41.157
It cannot leave the city.

25:43.529 --> 25:46.028
Watch out!

25:46.030 --> 25:47.297
Hold on, Peng.

25:47.299 --> 25:49.098
There! There they are.

25:49.100 --> 25:51.033
Whoa!

25:53.739 --> 25:56.306
Whoa!

25:56.308 --> 25:58.475
Whoa!

26:04.182 --> 26:05.516
I think we lost them.

26:05.518 --> 26:07.083
Look, down there.

26:07.085 --> 26:08.452
That boat's leaving the city.

26:08.454 --> 26:11.087
You-you have to get on it.

26:22.468 --> 26:24.068
Get into position.

26:26.605 --> 26:29.339
- Oh, there she is!
- Oh, my gosh!

26:29.341 --> 26:30.607
Take the shot.

26:30.609 --> 26:32.074
What?

26:32.076 --> 26:34.076
There's a girl with him?

26:34.078 --> 26:36.313
Oh, no.
How is she gonna get away?

26:38.049 --> 26:39.516
Wait, wait.
What time is it?

26:39.518 --> 26:41.518
8:00. Why?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.587
Time for the light show.

26:50.463 --> 26:53.497
Ooh! Aah!

26:53.499 --> 26:55.231
Come on, Yi.

27:01.273 --> 27:03.105
Where are they?

27:03.107 --> 27:04.207
They're gone.

27:04.209 --> 27:06.142
Copy that. They're gone.

27:06.144 --> 27:08.110
And I'm dead.

27:08.112 --> 27:10.112
Don't rub it in.

27:10.114 --> 27:12.451
Come on!
Keep searching!

27:13.619 --> 27:16.653
Oh! There they are.

27:16.655 --> 27:19.256
Come on, Peng.

27:19.258 --> 27:21.293
Over there. That one.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.667
You have to get on that boat.

27:30.669 --> 27:32.503
When that boat lands,
don't stop.

27:32.505 --> 27:34.404
Don't stop until
you reach your mountain.

27:34.406 --> 27:36.205
Don't stop until you're home.

27:36.207 --> 27:38.140
Okay? Home.

27:40.144 --> 27:42.111
Oh, you-you have to go. Now!

27:46.552 --> 27:48.117
Hide.

27:57.195 --> 27:58.462
Yi!

27:58.464 --> 28:00.231
Yi, are you okay?

28:02.434 --> 28:03.600
Oh, no.

28:03.602 --> 28:07.573
Oh, no, no, no, Yi.
Don't you dare!

28:12.110 --> 28:15.479
Yi!

28:26.458 --> 28:29.560
I guess I'm coming with you,
huh... Everest?

28:31.229 --> 28:32.429
Yi?

28:32.431 --> 28:34.398
Yi, are you crazy?!

28:34.400 --> 28:37.303
- Wait for me!
- Peng? Peng! No!

28:39.471 --> 28:42.171
No, no, no, no, no, no!

28:44.343 --> 28:45.475
Peng!

28:45.477 --> 28:48.512
I'm responsible for you.

28:48.514 --> 28:50.614
Your mom's gonna kill me.

28:52.351 --> 28:54.520
My babies.

28:56.355 --> 28:58.589
No, no, no.
You think this is funny?

28:58.591 --> 29:00.490
Do you even know
how much I paid for these?

29:05.331 --> 29:07.497
What were you thinking, Yi?

29:07.499 --> 29:10.500
You have gotten me
into so much trouble.

29:10.502 --> 29:13.202
I am so mad at you right now.
You know what?

29:13.204 --> 29:15.706
I-I can't even talk to you
right now! That's how mad I am!

29:32.791 --> 29:36.393
The unveiling is
in one week, Captain.

29:36.395 --> 29:39.663
Now, how am I supposed
to prove the yeti exists

29:39.665 --> 29:43.667
when I don't have a yeti?

29:43.669 --> 29:45.535
- Uh...
- No speaking!

29:45.537 --> 29:47.604
Only leaving.

29:50.309 --> 29:51.742
Dr. Zara,
what am I going to do?

29:51.744 --> 29:53.744
The science community
will be there.

29:53.746 --> 29:55.479
The press will be there.

29:55.481 --> 29:59.616
The world will be there,
watching with their eyes.

29:59.618 --> 30:02.653
Mr. Burnish, there are
many rare and exotic animals

30:02.655 --> 30:04.421
you have collected
over the years.

30:04.423 --> 30:05.989
These snakes, for example.

30:05.991 --> 30:07.557
You're the only one
in the world

30:07.559 --> 30:10.293
to have a newly born clutch
of rare whooping snakes.

30:11.797 --> 30:14.264
Down, down, down!

30:14.266 --> 30:17.534
Go in your hole,
you weird snakes.

30:17.536 --> 30:19.336
Sir, please.

30:19.338 --> 30:21.738
These creatures
are to be respected.

30:23.409 --> 30:24.675
Hmm.

30:24.677 --> 30:26.476
They would make a lovely belt.

30:26.478 --> 30:29.312
Mr. Burnish,
they are one of a kind.

30:29.314 --> 30:30.580
A one-of-a-kind whooping belt.

30:30.582 --> 30:32.649
A belt that goes "whoop."
Do I want that?

30:32.651 --> 30:34.284
I don't know.

30:35.454 --> 30:38.355
Take them away.

30:38.357 --> 30:40.590
Wait, how many snakes
are there supposed to be?

30:40.592 --> 30:42.359
Uh, why?

30:44.563 --> 30:46.797
We promised the public a yeti,

30:46.799 --> 30:49.466
and nothing else will do.
Nothing!

30:49.468 --> 30:52.602
I don't care if the yeti
is dead or alive.

30:52.604 --> 30:54.604
I just need him.

30:55.741 --> 30:57.607
Your gerbil is freaking me out.

30:57.609 --> 31:01.311
Jerboa.
Duchess is an albino jerboa,

31:01.313 --> 31:03.313
and she, too, is one of a kind.

31:03.315 --> 31:06.817
Sir, as a zoologist,
it is my mission in life

31:06.819 --> 31:09.052
to make sure that all animals
are protected,

31:09.054 --> 31:11.354
especially the rare
and exotic ones.

31:11.356 --> 31:14.491
That is the only reason
I agreed to find your yeti.

31:14.493 --> 31:15.792
And you did.

31:15.794 --> 31:19.629
For a few short days,
we had one,

31:19.631 --> 31:24.634
but I cannot go
to that unveiling empty-handed.

31:24.636 --> 31:27.637
I will not be made
into a laughingstock again.

31:27.639 --> 31:29.773
Not, not, not, not, not!

31:29.775 --> 31:31.842
Uh, there's news, Mr. Burnish.

31:31.844 --> 31:33.510
News about you leaving?

31:33.512 --> 31:35.512
A dockworker saw
a creature and some kids

31:35.514 --> 31:37.514
boarding a cargo barge
last night.

31:37.516 --> 31:40.517
Dr. Zara, you are the best
in your field.

31:40.519 --> 31:42.552
Please, help me get him back.

31:42.554 --> 31:44.554
Under one condition.

31:44.556 --> 31:46.790
We bring the yeti back alive.

31:46.792 --> 31:50.761
You have to promise me
he will not be harmed.

31:50.763 --> 31:52.896
Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

31:52.898 --> 31:54.898
Captain, where did
that boat land?

31:54.900 --> 31:56.399
Uh...

31:56.401 --> 31:57.801
Yeah, Ma.

31:57.803 --> 32:00.670
Uh, Beijing is, um... is great.

32:00.672 --> 32:03.507
And the dorms...
the dorms are clean.

32:03.509 --> 32:04.908
Peng? Oh, Peng is, uh...

32:04.910 --> 32:06.710
Look at all those teeth.

32:06.712 --> 32:08.345
Peng's fine.

32:08.347 --> 32:09.579
Hey, hey.

32:09.581 --> 32:11.648
Oh, and Yi came, too.

32:11.650 --> 32:13.383
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

32:13.385 --> 32:15.352
She's, uh... she's checking out
the university.

32:15.354 --> 32:16.787
Soda?

32:16.789 --> 32:18.588
Oh, yeah!

32:18.590 --> 32:20.390
Mom never lets me have any.

32:21.627 --> 32:22.628
Catch!

32:29.568 --> 32:31.701
Hey, Everest, come over here.

32:31.703 --> 32:33.436
How long will we be here?

32:34.640 --> 32:36.673
Oh, uh, excuse me.

32:36.675 --> 32:38.575
Cafeteria food
is a little rich.

32:38.577 --> 32:40.577
Well, I got to go, Ma. Bye.

32:40.579 --> 32:43.947
I cannot believe that
you made me lie to my mother.

32:43.949 --> 32:45.916
I love this stuff!

32:47.452 --> 32:49.586
Hey, okay. Everest, look.

32:49.588 --> 32:53.456
First, you go over
the Yellow Mountain.

32:53.458 --> 32:55.859
Then to the Yangtze River.

32:55.861 --> 32:58.461
And that river will take you
most of the way

32:58.463 --> 33:02.599
to the Himalayas,
and finally to Mount Everest.

33:02.601 --> 33:04.601
This is how
you're going to get home.

33:04.603 --> 33:05.869
Whoa, wait.

33:05.871 --> 33:07.470
Mount Everest?
No, no, no.

33:07.472 --> 33:08.939
That has to be
hundreds of miles away.

33:08.941 --> 33:10.607
Actually, it's thousands.

33:11.944 --> 33:14.446
I just hope he can make it
all that way.

33:18.750 --> 33:20.817
He, um... he seems capable.

33:23.722 --> 33:26.890
Look at all those people.

33:26.892 --> 33:28.758
- Hello!
- Peng, get down!

33:28.760 --> 33:30.493
Ow!

33:31.763 --> 33:33.630
Yeah, we should hide.

33:46.845 --> 33:49.613
Wait. Why are we still moving?

33:49.615 --> 33:51.815
Uh...

33:51.817 --> 33:54.217
'cause we're not
at the dock anymore.

33:54.219 --> 33:55.852
What?

33:55.854 --> 33:58.655
No!

34:04.696 --> 34:07.697
You know, I've never
been out of the city.

34:07.699 --> 34:09.799
Wow. I can't believe
how beautiful

34:09.801 --> 34:11.635
it is out here.

34:11.637 --> 34:14.004
I can't believe
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

34:14.006 --> 34:15.739
I'm starving.

34:17.776 --> 34:19.075
Uh-oh.

34:19.077 --> 34:21.044
Guys, I got to go.

34:21.046 --> 34:22.812
Just hold it.

34:25.083 --> 34:27.251
Oh, no. He's got to go.

34:27.253 --> 34:29.686
- Get me out of here!
- I can't.

34:32.090 --> 34:33.890
Out of my way!

34:33.892 --> 34:35.692
Got to go! Got to go!

34:35.694 --> 34:37.696
My head.

34:38.697 --> 34:40.063
- I'm good.
- Okay.

34:40.065 --> 34:41.564
Come on.

34:41.566 --> 34:43.633
Come on, come on, come on.

34:43.635 --> 34:45.735
One bar.
Okay, that's good enough.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.771
- Good enough for what?
- To buy tickets home.

34:47.773 --> 34:50.006
Okay, look, the next boat
leaves around 5:00,

34:50.008 --> 34:51.675
so let's hope
that's enough time

34:51.677 --> 34:53.576
to find our way back
to the dock.

34:53.578 --> 34:55.545
Peng, come on. We're leaving.

34:55.547 --> 34:57.113
Yes, waiter.
I'm ready to order.

34:57.115 --> 35:00.784
I'll have some of Nai Nai's
pork buns with extra pork.

35:00.786 --> 35:02.886
All right, get up, Peng.
We got to go.

35:02.888 --> 35:04.854
And a side of pork.

35:16.101 --> 35:17.767
Is he...
Why is he making that...

35:17.769 --> 35:19.970
- Shh, shh, shh. Jin.
- Is he humming?

35:22.741 --> 35:24.741
What's going on?

35:24.743 --> 35:26.310
Whoa.

35:30.882 --> 35:32.549
What is happening?

35:32.551 --> 35:35.752
Whoa. Is that a...

35:35.754 --> 35:37.723
A blueberry?

35:42.928 --> 35:44.896
Food!

35:48.934 --> 35:50.567
Guys, these are delicious.

35:50.569 --> 35:52.569
That doesn't make any sense.

35:52.571 --> 35:54.938
No, no, this is not possible.

35:56.842 --> 35:58.041
It's not funny, all right?

35:58.043 --> 35:59.642
This is cashmere!

35:59.644 --> 36:01.811
Uh, Jin?

36:03.015 --> 36:04.681
Now what?

36:04.683 --> 36:06.182
Oh.

36:06.184 --> 36:09.886
Everest, do something.

36:12.624 --> 36:14.624
Run!

36:17.729 --> 36:18.795
Incoming!

36:21.133 --> 36:24.801
- Run!
- Go faster!

36:26.805 --> 36:29.172
Oh, no!

36:29.174 --> 36:33.043
Save yourselves!

36:35.113 --> 36:36.646
I'm hit!

36:36.648 --> 36:38.815
Tell Nai Nai's pork buns
I love them.

36:54.199 --> 36:57.002
Hey, Jin, did you get
enough to eat?

36:58.670 --> 37:01.405
Let's just say I've got
blueberries in places

37:01.407 --> 37:04.007
where blueberries should never be.

37:06.144 --> 37:08.144
Come on, Everest.

37:08.146 --> 37:09.979
Okay.

37:09.981 --> 37:13.650
Watch and learn.

37:13.652 --> 37:15.952
Bank shot.

37:20.025 --> 37:21.925
- I'm exhausted.
- What?

37:21.927 --> 37:23.726
Why are you stopping?

37:23.728 --> 37:26.062
Because, in about five minutes,
we won't be able to see

37:26.064 --> 37:27.864
our hands
in front of our faces.

37:27.866 --> 37:30.267
And that is exactly why
we've got to keep moving.

37:30.269 --> 37:31.868
All right?
Come on, Peng.

37:31.870 --> 37:33.870
We need to get back
to that dock.

37:35.907 --> 37:37.240
First thing in the morning.

37:37.242 --> 37:38.610
Yes!

37:44.749 --> 37:46.250
There's so many.

37:46.252 --> 37:48.118
- Bugs?
- Stars.

37:48.120 --> 37:51.020
How come
they're only swarming me?

37:51.022 --> 37:52.755
Maybe they're ladybugs.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.258
Lady... Not funny.

37:54.260 --> 37:56.759
Well, my mom told me
that the stars

37:56.761 --> 37:58.895
are our ancestors
who always watch over us.

38:00.899 --> 38:02.765
My mom says that, too.

38:02.767 --> 38:04.734
My backpack?

38:04.736 --> 38:06.903
Peng!

38:06.905 --> 38:09.772
Oh, no, no, no, no!

38:09.774 --> 38:11.841
Great. No reception.

38:11.843 --> 38:13.910
I'm entirely cut off
from my social life.

38:13.912 --> 38:15.211
Mm. How traumatic.

38:15.213 --> 38:16.913
Yeah, Yi, it is.

38:16.915 --> 38:19.182
Because, unlike you,
I like having friends.

38:19.184 --> 38:21.751
- I'm not some kind of a-a...
- Loner?

38:21.753 --> 38:24.187
Is that what
you were gonna say?

38:24.189 --> 38:28.091
Well, for your info,
I'm a self-proclaimed loner.

38:28.093 --> 38:29.792
There's a difference, okay?

38:29.794 --> 38:31.027
Fine, because in the morning,

38:31.029 --> 38:33.196
Peng and I are headed back
to the city.

38:33.198 --> 38:35.231
- I-I can't leave him.
- Yi.

38:35.233 --> 38:37.301
You've seen what he can do.

38:37.303 --> 38:39.802
He's-he's amazing.

38:39.804 --> 38:42.138
He's... he's magical.

38:42.140 --> 38:44.275
Oh, so now he's a magical yeti.

38:44.277 --> 38:46.343
Do you realize
how crazy you sound?

38:46.345 --> 38:48.945
Look what happened
with the blueberries.

38:48.947 --> 38:51.214
That wasn't him.
That was a natural phenomenon.

38:51.216 --> 38:54.050
Just one that
I can't explain yet.

38:54.052 --> 38:57.820
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

38:57.822 --> 38:59.088
Go!

39:02.928 --> 39:05.028
Hey, you cheated!

39:12.904 --> 39:16.172
Will you two please
just give it a rest!

39:16.174 --> 39:18.841
Oh, my gosh, I'm beginning
to sound like my parents.

39:18.843 --> 39:20.810
That's it!

39:20.812 --> 39:22.979
That's why
they get along so well.

39:22.981 --> 39:25.215
Everest is just a kid.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.850
He's probably, like, the same
age as Peng but in yeti years.

39:27.852 --> 39:30.220
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

39:30.222 --> 39:33.223
Right. There's no way
that giant thing is a kid.

39:33.225 --> 39:34.958
Wait. I'll prove it to you.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.193
Everest, come over here.

39:41.334 --> 39:44.133
This is you.

39:45.571 --> 39:49.138
And your parents.

39:49.140 --> 39:52.276
Aw. You have
your mother's eyes.

39:54.145 --> 39:56.313
Don't worry.
I will make sure you get home.

39:56.315 --> 39:58.014
What are you gonna do?

39:58.016 --> 40:01.050
- Take him all the way back to Mount Everest?
- Maybe I am.

40:01.052 --> 40:03.853
Jin, he needs to get back
to his family.

40:03.855 --> 40:06.423
And what about your family?
Don't they need you, too?

40:06.425 --> 40:08.359
Always busy, never home.

40:08.361 --> 40:10.226
What's that all about, Yi?

40:10.228 --> 40:13.029
Don't talk to me about family.

40:13.031 --> 40:14.964
You have no idea.

40:14.966 --> 40:17.033
No idea.
Your...

40:17.035 --> 40:19.035
Your life is so easy, Jin.

40:19.037 --> 40:21.204
Do you even... do you even
want to be a doctor,

40:21.206 --> 40:22.872
or do you just think
that you'll...

40:22.874 --> 40:24.874
I don't know...
you'll look good in white?

40:24.876 --> 40:27.910
All right.
Call me shallow all you want.

40:27.912 --> 40:29.313
At least I'm not delusional.

40:34.420 --> 40:36.853
I don't care
if you think I'm crazy.

40:38.023 --> 40:39.325
You're impossible.

41:00.245 --> 41:01.781
Huh?

41:04.215 --> 41:06.217
Is that Yi?

41:17.363 --> 41:20.264
Wait. Don't stop.
It's really good.

41:20.266 --> 41:22.965
Your <i>nai nai</i> said you stopped
playing after your dad died.

41:22.967 --> 41:24.100
Peng!

41:24.102 --> 41:26.135
It's okay, Jin. Really.

41:26.137 --> 41:28.104
Was this your dad's violin?

41:28.106 --> 41:29.440
Mm-hmm.

41:29.442 --> 41:32.942
You know,
I really liked your dad.

41:32.944 --> 41:34.245
Thanks, Peng.

41:36.147 --> 41:38.147
Well, we better head out
if we're gonna

41:38.149 --> 41:39.483
make it to the Yangtze River.

41:39.485 --> 41:41.318
- You're coming?
- Yeah.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.119
I checked,
and Dahe village has boats

41:43.121 --> 41:44.488
leaving for the city
every hour.

41:45.957 --> 41:47.291
Okay, well, when we get there,

41:47.293 --> 41:49.926
you and Peng can take
a boat back, but...

41:49.928 --> 41:51.395
I'm going to take Everest home.

42:01.072 --> 42:03.039
Well, that boat
pulled in yesterday morning,

42:03.041 --> 42:05.275
but we've unloaded all of the
cargo and didn't find anyone.

42:05.277 --> 42:09.145
Would you mind
if we search it again?

42:09.147 --> 42:11.315
- You got anything?
- No, Captain.

42:11.317 --> 42:13.082
He was here?

42:13.084 --> 42:14.418
Yes.

42:14.420 --> 42:17.188
And it looks like
he fancies soda.

42:27.098 --> 42:29.165
Stop!

42:29.167 --> 42:31.435
Down there.

42:31.437 --> 42:34.139
What was that?

42:35.307 --> 42:36.740
Sorry, Doctor.

42:36.742 --> 42:38.943
There's no sign
of them anywhere.

42:40.746 --> 42:43.112
Sir, the yeti has disappeared.

42:43.114 --> 42:46.350
It has been so long
since I've been out in nature.

42:46.352 --> 42:48.519
- Sir, if we...
- Look at this tree.

42:48.521 --> 42:51.053
It's a wonderful tree.

42:51.055 --> 42:53.089
Look at the colors.

42:53.091 --> 42:55.124
I love this tree.
You there, chop it down

42:55.126 --> 42:57.327
- and put it in a bag, will you?
- Right away, sir.

42:57.329 --> 42:58.995
I want it in my penthouse...

42:58.997 --> 43:01.030
to be with me.

43:01.032 --> 43:03.467
- Mr. Burnish.
- Right. What? What is it?

43:03.469 --> 43:06.135
We should divide the team
and cover some ground.

43:06.137 --> 43:09.406
Captain, let us fan out.

43:09.408 --> 43:11.408
Yes, sir.

43:13.244 --> 43:15.077
Now, on the map, that village

43:15.079 --> 43:16.380
is only, like,
a centimeter away.

43:16.382 --> 43:18.482
That can't be that far.

43:18.484 --> 43:20.451
It must just be
on the other side of the...

43:22.220 --> 43:23.454
The Yellow Mountain.

43:27.626 --> 43:29.593
- Wow.
- Wait. Wait.

43:29.595 --> 43:32.228
We are not going over that.

43:32.230 --> 43:34.465
Come on, Everest.
I'll race you.

43:42.441 --> 43:44.575
Hey, you guys,
wait right there.

43:46.278 --> 43:48.545
Ooh. Everest, look.

43:48.547 --> 43:50.447
Make a wish.

43:50.449 --> 43:53.250
No, no.
They're for wishing.

43:54.587 --> 43:56.553
Leg cramp. Stop for a sec.

43:56.555 --> 43:59.523
Okay. I mean, if you
really need to.

44:02.628 --> 44:06.162
I wish I was
a basketball superstar.

44:08.601 --> 44:11.268
Starting
in the championship game,

44:11.270 --> 44:13.303
the mighty Peng!

44:17.576 --> 44:20.611
Wait, is that a drone?
Cool!

44:22.648 --> 44:24.581
Uh, okay.

44:24.583 --> 44:27.584
- Not so cool. Not so cool.
- Oh, no.

44:27.586 --> 44:29.353
It's those guys from the city.

44:29.355 --> 44:31.855
I told you
this was a crazy idea.

44:31.857 --> 44:34.658
- Captain, I have footage.
- Copy that.

44:34.660 --> 44:38.495
Those little thieves
stole my yeti.

44:38.497 --> 44:40.597
- Get us there.
- Keep your eyes on 'em.

44:40.599 --> 44:43.165
- We're on our way.
- Uh, what now?

44:43.167 --> 44:46.303
I wish there was
a way out of here.

44:48.541 --> 44:51.475
Uh, what's going on?

44:51.477 --> 44:53.477
- Whoa!
- Yi, let go of that.

44:53.479 --> 44:54.678
It's dangerous.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.513
Everest, are you sure
about this?

44:56.515 --> 45:00.317
No! Peng!
Get down from there right now!

45:00.319 --> 45:01.318
Hey, Peng!

45:01.320 --> 45:03.185
- Jin, jump!
- Jump!

45:03.187 --> 45:05.322
No! Get down here!
Give me your hand!

45:05.324 --> 45:06.657
Got you.

45:08.894 --> 45:12.228
Meet me at that village
by the river!

45:12.230 --> 45:14.431
- We'll be there!
- And take care of Peng!

45:16.200 --> 45:18.602
Wow.

45:18.604 --> 45:20.537
Whoo! Whoa!

45:20.539 --> 45:22.573
Yeah!

45:34.320 --> 45:36.520
- Whoa!
- Everyone, push!

45:38.156 --> 45:39.389
Uh-oh.

45:44.630 --> 45:47.231
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

45:50.369 --> 45:52.234
- Are you catching this?
- Is that a giant...

45:52.236 --> 45:53.570
dandelion?

45:53.572 --> 45:55.539
Giant dandelions?

45:55.541 --> 45:58.575
Look, stop messing about
and get my yeti!

45:58.577 --> 46:00.546
Uh, yes, sir.
Let's take 'em down.

46:12.758 --> 46:14.391
Yeah!

46:14.393 --> 46:15.759
Take that, drones.

46:20.966 --> 46:23.567
So, who's going to tell
Mr. Burnish?

46:23.569 --> 46:25.268
Not it!

46:25.270 --> 46:27.537
- Help!
- Wait, where are we going?!

46:32.611 --> 46:34.511
I hope you're not hurt.

46:34.513 --> 46:36.279
Let me introduce myself.

46:36.281 --> 46:38.214
- I'm Dr. Zara.
- I know who you are.

46:38.216 --> 46:39.483
You do?

46:39.485 --> 46:40.817
Yeah.

46:40.819 --> 46:42.452
You're the bad guys.

46:42.454 --> 46:43.687
Aah!

46:43.689 --> 46:45.422
Your gerbil is freaking me out.

46:45.424 --> 46:46.823
A boy that knows his gerbils.

46:46.825 --> 46:48.458
I like him.

46:48.460 --> 46:50.827
Bad? Listen,
you've got this all wrong.

46:50.829 --> 46:55.365
That wild beast is
unpredictable, even dangerous.

46:55.367 --> 46:57.367
We were trying
to rescue your friend

46:57.369 --> 46:58.769
when the yeti kidnapped her.

46:58.771 --> 47:01.838
He did kidnap her.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.740
Listen, you twit!

47:03.742 --> 47:06.242
I own that yeti.
He is my yeti.

47:06.244 --> 47:07.811
I want my yeti back!

47:07.813 --> 47:09.780
Right? Just nod.

47:09.782 --> 47:11.715
Mr. Burnish, please.

47:11.717 --> 47:13.717
Ow.

47:13.719 --> 47:15.419
All right, look.

47:15.421 --> 47:17.754
I-I just need to find my cousin
and my friend

47:17.756 --> 47:20.023
and get 'em back
to the city in one piece.

47:20.025 --> 47:22.359
I can get all of you
back to the city,

47:22.361 --> 47:24.461
but the only way
I can help your friends

47:24.463 --> 47:27.466
is if I know where they are.
Do you know?

47:28.867 --> 47:32.302
That yeti is the pinnacle
of my research.

47:32.304 --> 47:35.672
I really need him back.

47:35.674 --> 47:38.608
I don't know where they are,

47:38.610 --> 47:41.346
but I do know
where they will be.

47:49.822 --> 47:51.888
Brace yourselves!

47:58.297 --> 48:00.731
Everest.

48:00.733 --> 48:03.333
No, over here.

48:06.605 --> 48:09.506
That was amazing, Everest.

48:09.508 --> 48:11.641
You saved us, and now we're...

48:11.643 --> 48:13.543
we're... we...

48:13.545 --> 48:16.480
Where are we?

48:16.482 --> 48:18.849
All I know is
we're a long way from Jin.

48:18.851 --> 48:21.551
Yeah, well, that's his fault.
He should have jumped.

48:21.553 --> 48:23.854
I mean, why...
why doesn't he ever just jump?

48:23.856 --> 48:26.823
He did. He jumped on that boat
back in the city.

48:26.825 --> 48:29.593
That's what got him on
this trip in the first place.

48:29.595 --> 48:31.661
Yeah, but that's because
he was worried about you.

48:31.663 --> 48:32.796
You're his family.

48:32.798 --> 48:35.432
Yi, he thinks of you
as family, too.

48:35.434 --> 48:37.634
Wh-What?

48:44.843 --> 48:48.345
Hey, little turtle.

48:48.347 --> 48:50.881
Everest, Jin said Yi
was like his little sister

48:50.883 --> 48:52.682
when they were kids.

48:52.684 --> 48:54.651
She was always doing
something crazy

48:54.653 --> 48:56.586
that would get her
into trouble,

48:56.588 --> 48:58.822
so he had to watch out for her.

49:00.425 --> 49:01.827
And he still does.

49:03.862 --> 49:07.631
I... I-I think
we should get going.

49:07.633 --> 49:10.667
But don't worry.
I can get us out of here.

49:10.669 --> 49:12.437
Let's go.

49:13.972 --> 49:15.808
Put 'em down, Everest.

49:33.926 --> 49:37.561
Suddenly, I saw it.

49:37.563 --> 49:40.730
A yeti. A real yeti.

49:40.732 --> 49:43.934
Cold eyes staring.

49:43.936 --> 49:46.469
It tried to kill me!

49:46.471 --> 49:48.505
I needed to protect myself.

49:48.507 --> 49:51.007
I swung my ice ax...

49:51.009 --> 49:53.009
and it was gone.

49:53.011 --> 49:54.878
No footprints.

49:54.880 --> 49:56.613
Nothing.

49:56.615 --> 49:58.682
I rushed back to tell the world
what had happened,

49:58.684 --> 50:03.620
but without proof...
they laughed at me.

50:03.622 --> 50:06.756
They laughed at me.

50:06.758 --> 50:09.893
You spent all these years
trying to get your proof?

50:09.895 --> 50:11.895
Mm-hmm.

50:11.897 --> 50:16.967
I'm so used to
looking down on the world,

50:16.969 --> 50:19.769
it's amazing
how small one feels

50:19.771 --> 50:22.639
just by looking up.

50:22.641 --> 50:25.508
Mr. Burnish, we need to get
an early start.

50:25.510 --> 50:28.812
Thanks to Jin, we've learned
the yeti's whereabouts.

50:28.814 --> 50:31.982
Yes, yes.

50:31.984 --> 50:34.484
Duchess... is that your name?

50:34.486 --> 50:35.886
You're kind of cute, you know,

50:35.888 --> 50:39.923
in your own ugly,
beady-eyed kind of way.

50:45.664 --> 50:48.531
I can't feel my feet.

50:48.533 --> 50:50.967
"Don't worry.
I'll get us out of here."

50:50.969 --> 50:53.803
What was I thinking?

50:53.805 --> 50:55.872
We are completely lost.

50:55.874 --> 50:57.807
Everest is
nowhere near his mountain,

50:57.809 --> 50:59.542
and for all we know, Jin...

50:59.544 --> 51:01.745
Jin could be in trouble
right now, and it's...

51:01.747 --> 51:04.614
It's all my fault.

51:06.518 --> 51:09.253
Jin said this trip was
a crazy idea, and...

51:09.255 --> 51:11.855
I don't know, maybe...
maybe he's right.

51:11.857 --> 51:13.823
I mean, but...

51:13.825 --> 51:15.825
we could sure use him
right now.

51:15.827 --> 51:19.562
Yeah.
And the map on his cell phone.

51:21.099 --> 51:23.533
It's okay, Everest.
It's just a koi fish.

51:23.535 --> 51:25.001
That's weird.

51:25.003 --> 51:27.070
Why are they swimming
against the current?

51:27.072 --> 51:28.941
They're actually trying
to get back home.

51:30.676 --> 51:32.575
Ooh.

51:35.013 --> 51:36.947
Yeah, let's just put him back.

51:36.949 --> 51:38.715
Do you think he'll make it?

51:38.717 --> 51:40.850
Well, he's sure gonna try.

51:40.852 --> 51:43.086
You know these fish are
the symbol of perseverance?

51:43.088 --> 51:44.587
What?

51:46.058 --> 51:48.124
It's, uh... it's just
something my mom told me.

51:48.126 --> 51:51.863
It means that,
when things get really tough...

51:53.565 --> 51:55.098
...they never give up.

51:55.100 --> 51:56.666
You know what, guys?

51:56.668 --> 51:58.101
We have to keep going.
Come on.

51:58.103 --> 51:59.736
Come on, you guys, let's go.

52:00.872 --> 52:02.507
Everest, put the fish down.

52:03.742 --> 52:06.044
Into the water.

52:22.928 --> 52:26.330
- Ow.
- Get back, you abominable creature.

52:26.332 --> 52:27.797
Back!

52:36.041 --> 52:38.608
That's great. Of course.

52:38.610 --> 52:40.744
He said in
the sweetest little voice,

52:40.746 --> 52:44.147
"You're cute in your own ugly,
beady-eyed kind of way."

52:45.917 --> 52:47.917
I tell you, he's going soft.

52:47.919 --> 52:49.953
We need to act fast.
If that kid is right

52:49.955 --> 52:52.022
and we find the yeti
at the river tomorrow,

52:52.024 --> 52:54.991
use any means possible
to take him down.

52:54.993 --> 52:57.127
I thought we had to keep
the yeti alive.

52:57.129 --> 52:59.729
The buyer won't pay us
unless he's still breathing,

52:59.731 --> 53:01.664
but if he's a little banged up,
who cares?

53:01.666 --> 53:03.733
They're just gonna chop him up
into little pieces

53:03.735 --> 53:05.369
for their experiments anyway.

53:05.371 --> 53:07.670
Well, what do we do
with the kids?

53:07.672 --> 53:08.972
If you want your ten percent,

53:08.974 --> 53:10.807
you'll get rid of them...
for good!

53:12.677 --> 53:15.011
Oh, and get rid of this rodent
I've been carrying around.

53:15.013 --> 53:17.147
Do you know
how hard it is to keep up

53:17.149 --> 53:18.948
this British animal-lover act?

53:18.950 --> 53:20.016
I'm done!

53:20.018 --> 53:23.953
Duchess? But she's
a one-of-a-kind albino jerboa.

53:23.955 --> 53:26.122
She's just a rat, you idiot!

53:26.124 --> 53:28.126
Hey. My keys.

53:35.734 --> 53:39.037
Here. I think you're
better off with this guy.

53:42.140 --> 53:44.976
Mmm. Not now.

53:48.080 --> 53:49.846
All right, let's see.

53:49.848 --> 53:51.716
SUV? Too loud.

53:53.419 --> 53:55.153
Transporter? No.

53:56.822 --> 53:58.255
What's this one?

54:00.959 --> 54:02.194
Sweet.

54:04.696 --> 54:05.929
Check the hair.

54:05.931 --> 54:07.197
Looking good, Jin.

54:07.199 --> 54:09.065
Thanks, Jin.

54:09.067 --> 54:11.002
All right, let's do this.

54:15.107 --> 54:16.108
Oh!

54:35.961 --> 54:38.262
It's okay, babies.
It's okay. I got you.

55:05.991 --> 55:08.793
Nope. Nope.
I can't do it.

55:09.861 --> 55:12.095
All right, fine, just take it!

55:16.201 --> 55:19.068
Be the koi fish.

55:19.070 --> 55:20.904
Be the koi fish.

55:20.906 --> 55:23.006
That's it, Peng.

55:23.008 --> 55:24.774
You keep swimming.

55:26.178 --> 55:27.744
What was that?

55:27.746 --> 55:30.079
Come on!

55:30.081 --> 55:31.915
All right!

55:31.917 --> 55:33.783
No more swimming!

55:33.785 --> 55:35.985
Yeah, but how
are we gonna catch it?

55:50.769 --> 55:53.304
Whoo-hoo!

55:56.375 --> 55:59.042
Now, this is the way to travel.

55:59.044 --> 56:00.944
Ready, Everest?

56:04.149 --> 56:05.848
Again.

56:05.850 --> 56:07.917
You know, Everest, I...

56:07.919 --> 56:09.986
I can't figure you out.

56:09.988 --> 56:12.121
I mean, how...
how do you do that?

56:12.123 --> 56:14.123
Ah.

56:14.125 --> 56:17.294
Maybe it's his gift,
like when you play the violin

56:17.296 --> 56:19.330
or when I play basketball.

56:19.332 --> 56:22.031
Everest talks to nature.

56:22.033 --> 56:25.001
Now, that... that is a gift.

56:46.392 --> 56:49.260
- Well, this is the village.
- Do you see Jin?

56:49.262 --> 56:52.161
Through that mob?
Are you kidding me?

56:52.163 --> 56:54.298
- We need to both look for him.
- What about Everest?

56:54.300 --> 56:56.300
- Move it, yaks.
- Oh.

56:56.302 --> 56:57.601
Got an idea.

56:57.603 --> 57:00.069
Grab all of that rope.

57:09.014 --> 57:10.614
Can you see anything?

57:10.616 --> 57:11.914
Nope.

57:11.916 --> 57:14.217
Yi, there he is!

57:14.219 --> 57:16.453
Jin! Jin!

57:16.455 --> 57:18.322
We're gonna lose him.

57:18.324 --> 57:21.092
I'll run ahead.
Stay there and blend in.

57:22.127 --> 57:25.228
Oh, your yak is odd-looking.

57:25.230 --> 57:28.332
Hey, don't body-shame my yak.

57:28.334 --> 57:29.932
Jin! Jin!

57:31.136 --> 57:32.469
- Yes?
- Whoa.

57:32.471 --> 57:34.806
I am so sorry.

57:35.940 --> 57:38.241
No.

57:38.243 --> 57:39.310
Keep looking.

57:39.312 --> 57:40.910
He said they would be here.

57:40.912 --> 57:42.881
I can't believe
he crashed my bike.

57:44.115 --> 57:45.416
Look!

57:45.418 --> 57:46.949
Target spotted.
Move out.

57:48.987 --> 57:51.255
They found us. Let's go.

57:51.257 --> 57:52.656
Go!

57:52.658 --> 57:54.658
Go, Everest, go! Move it!

57:54.660 --> 57:57.361
- No. Oh, no.
- Hey, you.

57:57.363 --> 57:58.895
Need a ride?

57:58.897 --> 58:01.398
Jin?

58:01.400 --> 58:04.000
- You showed up.
- Of course I did.

58:04.002 --> 58:05.968
Wait. Where's Peng?

58:07.373 --> 58:09.074
Everest!

58:11.242 --> 58:12.909
Oh, no.

58:12.911 --> 58:16.112
Coming in at four-foot-ten
and ready to take the game,

58:16.114 --> 58:18.482
the mighty Peng!

58:20.218 --> 58:21.984
High five! Yeah!

58:31.430 --> 58:33.430
- Everest! Peng!
- Peng, come on!

58:33.432 --> 58:34.999
Jin, I knew you'd be here.

58:36.234 --> 58:37.967
Good to see you, coz.

58:37.969 --> 58:39.403
What happened to your babies?

58:39.405 --> 58:42.071
Well, Peng...

58:42.073 --> 58:44.375
my babies are all grown-up.

58:44.377 --> 58:46.142
Hang on.

58:48.012 --> 58:50.179
Captain, don't you dare
let them get away!

58:50.181 --> 58:53.250
Hold on. This little lady has
a few tricks up her sleeve.

59:05.531 --> 59:07.398
Go faster!

59:07.400 --> 59:09.165
I'm trying!

59:09.167 --> 59:11.236
Everest, do something.

59:16.375 --> 59:19.008
- Hurry, Everest.
- Whoa.

59:21.280 --> 59:22.513
- It's working.
- Uh...

59:22.515 --> 59:24.013
Oh, no.

59:24.015 --> 59:25.416
Guys? Guys!

59:25.418 --> 59:28.419
- Turn! Turn, turn, turn!
- Turn! Turn!

59:35.261 --> 59:37.195
Ow!

59:42.435 --> 59:44.501
Whoa.

59:44.503 --> 59:47.337
This is unbelievable.

59:49.073 --> 59:50.507
Peng, Peng, look.

59:50.509 --> 59:52.208
It's okay.

59:52.210 --> 59:54.210
Wow!

59:54.212 --> 59:57.148
Whoo-hoo!

1:00:00.286 --> 1:00:03.219
Whoa!

1:00:03.221 --> 1:00:05.221
This is amazing!

1:00:05.223 --> 1:00:06.457
This is impossible.

1:00:06.459 --> 1:00:08.492
Come on, Everest.

1:00:08.494 --> 1:00:10.494
Make it go bigger!

1:00:10.496 --> 1:00:13.397
Ooh. Whoa!

1:00:13.399 --> 1:00:14.531
Whoa!

1:00:14.533 --> 1:00:16.500
Higher!

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:19.369
Okay. Okay, that's enough.

1:00:19.371 --> 1:00:22.372
- Slow down!
- Peng!

1:00:22.374 --> 1:00:23.540
Slow down!

1:00:34.653 --> 1:00:37.387
- Peng!
- Where is he?

1:00:42.828 --> 1:00:45.395
Peng?

1:00:51.570 --> 1:00:53.537
Oh, no.

1:00:53.539 --> 1:00:56.406
Everest, no. Everest.

1:00:56.408 --> 1:00:57.541
Hold it in.

1:00:57.543 --> 1:00:59.345
No, no!

1:01:03.382 --> 1:01:05.249
Hey, Jin.

1:01:05.251 --> 1:01:07.520
You got a little something
right here.

1:01:19.265 --> 1:01:20.533
No.

1:01:21.867 --> 1:01:23.433
Oh, no.

1:01:23.435 --> 1:01:25.302
No.

1:01:25.304 --> 1:01:27.169
No. No.

1:01:30.609 --> 1:01:32.311
Yi?

1:01:52.364 --> 1:01:54.431
You okay?

1:01:56.669 --> 1:01:59.336
Yeah, um...

1:01:59.338 --> 1:02:04.343
that violin meant
everything to me.

1:02:07.178 --> 1:02:08.478
When we were little,

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:11.615
you know my dad used to play
all the time.

1:02:11.617 --> 1:02:14.216
Um...

1:02:14.218 --> 1:02:17.219
but every night,
when he was tucking me in,

1:02:17.221 --> 1:02:21.358
he would play this one song
just for me.

1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:23.527
And...

1:02:23.529 --> 1:02:26.763
I don't know, it-it made me
feel like everything...

1:02:26.765 --> 1:02:29.633
was gonna be okay.

1:02:32.203 --> 1:02:34.538
Yi, I'm sorry.

1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:37.239
I'm-I'm sorry for what I said.

1:02:37.241 --> 1:02:39.175
Too busy, never home. I...

1:02:39.177 --> 1:02:41.311
No. No, no, no, you-you're...
you're right.

1:02:41.313 --> 1:02:43.747
I... I know I keep busy.

1:02:43.749 --> 1:02:46.283
I just... I don't know why.

1:02:46.285 --> 1:02:48.752
I mean, I... I-I...

1:02:48.754 --> 1:02:53.590
I miss him, and I don't want
to miss him, but...

1:02:53.592 --> 1:02:56.526
I haven't even cried yet, Jin.

1:02:56.528 --> 1:03:00.764
And my family,
we're all so distant, and I...

1:03:00.766 --> 1:03:02.666
I don't know.

1:03:02.668 --> 1:03:05.769
I don't... I-I...
I don't know what to do.

1:03:05.771 --> 1:03:09.708
Well, are you sure they're
the ones who are distant?

1:03:12.511 --> 1:03:16.580
But you were right
about me, too.

1:03:16.582 --> 1:03:19.449
Yeah, hate to admit it,
but, I mean, that thought

1:03:19.451 --> 1:03:21.551
about looking good
in the white doctor's coat,

1:03:21.553 --> 1:03:23.687
it did cross my mind.

1:03:23.689 --> 1:03:26.556
I am a horrible,
horrible person.

1:03:28.694 --> 1:03:30.694
Yeah, you are the worst.

1:03:30.696 --> 1:03:33.229
I really... I am.

1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:36.566
Yi, listen.

1:03:36.568 --> 1:03:40.236
If those people find Everest,
we're all in danger.

1:03:40.238 --> 1:03:44.841
Wait, do... do they know
where I'm taking him?

1:03:44.843 --> 1:03:46.843
They are headed
to the Himalayas, sir.

1:03:46.845 --> 1:03:48.845
And the yeti's powers
will grow even stronger

1:03:48.847 --> 1:03:51.448
the closer he gets
to those mountains.

1:03:51.450 --> 1:03:54.351
But there's still one more
chance to capture your yeti.

1:03:54.353 --> 1:03:57.621
At the foothills of those
mountains, there's a bridge.

1:03:57.623 --> 1:04:01.391
Once the yeti crosses it,
he'll blend in, disappear.

1:04:01.393 --> 1:04:03.326
We will never find him again.

1:04:03.328 --> 1:04:06.363
I've never seen powers
like those before.

1:04:06.365 --> 1:04:08.832
It's intimidating.

1:04:08.834 --> 1:04:10.567
Stay the course, sir.

1:04:10.569 --> 1:04:15.539
After this, no one will ever
laugh at you again.

1:04:15.541 --> 1:04:17.340
You're right.

1:04:17.342 --> 1:04:20.277
Captain, we are going to need
reinforcements.

1:04:20.279 --> 1:04:22.846
Lots... of reinforcements.

1:04:22.848 --> 1:04:24.481
Yes, sir.

1:04:24.483 --> 1:04:27.584
What do those powers
mean for us?

1:04:27.586 --> 1:04:30.620
That yeti's
price tag just doubled.

1:04:30.622 --> 1:04:32.589
Hey, you guys,
did you find that thing?

1:04:32.591 --> 1:04:34.424
We're working on it.

1:04:34.426 --> 1:04:36.626
- There it is.
- There it is.

1:04:36.628 --> 1:04:38.628
♪ There it is. ♪

1:04:38.630 --> 1:04:40.697
Really, Dave?

1:04:45.604 --> 1:04:47.504
Come on. Come quickly.

1:04:47.506 --> 1:04:49.608
Everest?

1:04:51.777 --> 1:04:54.377
You okay?

1:05:00.385 --> 1:05:01.885
- Is that...
- Yeti hair?

1:05:01.887 --> 1:05:03.386
Yep.

1:05:09.461 --> 1:05:11.928
See?

1:05:11.930 --> 1:05:14.664
It's as good as new.

1:05:14.666 --> 1:05:16.666
No.

1:05:16.668 --> 1:05:18.902
It's better than new.

1:05:26.779 --> 1:05:29.412
Hey. When did you buy these?

1:05:29.414 --> 1:05:31.548
Oh, I-I-I didn't buy them.

1:05:31.550 --> 1:05:34.351
They were my dad's.

1:05:34.353 --> 1:05:36.353
He kept postcards
of all the places

1:05:36.355 --> 1:05:38.121
he wanted to take us someday.

1:05:38.123 --> 1:05:39.956
The... the whole family.

1:05:39.958 --> 1:05:42.728
Yi, they're all of the places
we've been.

1:05:46.632 --> 1:05:49.399
What?

1:05:49.401 --> 1:05:51.568
No way. What... How...

1:05:51.570 --> 1:05:53.570
How is this possible?

1:05:53.572 --> 1:05:54.838
That can't be.

1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:57.507
We've been to all of these.

1:05:57.509 --> 1:05:59.778
All but one.

1:06:06.819 --> 1:06:09.588
The Leshan Buddha.

1:06:11.423 --> 1:06:15.158
This is the place that my dad
wanted me to see the most.

1:06:15.160 --> 1:06:19.162
This... this is incredible.

1:06:19.164 --> 1:06:21.698
You brought me here,
didn't you?

1:06:23.402 --> 1:06:25.936
Whoa.

1:06:25.938 --> 1:06:27.940
Impossible.

1:06:53.765 --> 1:06:55.767
Whoa.

1:07:09.514 --> 1:07:11.882
Wow.

1:07:13.619 --> 1:07:15.654
I wish Dad were here
to see this.

1:09:16.675 --> 1:09:18.074
It's beautiful.

1:09:18.076 --> 1:09:20.610
Thank you, Everest.

1:09:22.848 --> 1:09:25.882
You did that, Yi. You did.

1:09:28.820 --> 1:09:30.620
I did that?

1:09:34.092 --> 1:09:36.092
Whoa.

1:09:37.696 --> 1:09:38.995
Come on, Everest.

1:09:38.997 --> 1:09:40.799
Yi.

1:09:44.036 --> 1:09:47.739
We are so going
to the Himalayas.

1:09:56.148 --> 1:09:57.947
Come on, you guys.

1:09:57.949 --> 1:09:58.982
Whoa, whoa!

1:09:58.984 --> 1:10:00.817
Okay, okay!

1:10:16.168 --> 1:10:18.868
Hold on, Peng. Whoo-hoo!

1:10:58.777 --> 1:11:00.110
Come on. If we keep going,

1:11:00.112 --> 1:11:02.078
we'll get to the Himalayas
by morning.

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:05.048
Those guys are not gonna stop
until they get... Everest!

1:11:05.050 --> 1:11:07.684
Is that better?

1:11:07.686 --> 1:11:09.986
Maybe.

1:11:09.988 --> 1:11:11.754
We still have to
keep going, though.

1:11:11.756 --> 1:11:13.156
I know.

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:17.160
Will it be the same?

1:11:17.162 --> 1:11:20.029
You know,
when Everest goes home?

1:11:20.031 --> 1:11:22.031
With us, I mean.

1:11:22.033 --> 1:11:24.234
Like, will you guys
still want to hang out?

1:11:24.236 --> 1:11:27.036
Of course we will, Peng.

1:11:27.038 --> 1:11:30.773
You know, I'll sure miss
seeing these stars.

1:11:30.775 --> 1:11:32.276
Yeah, but even though
we can't see them,

1:11:32.278 --> 1:11:34.144
we'll still know they're there.

1:11:34.146 --> 1:11:36.045
So, that's kind of cool,
isn't it?

1:11:36.047 --> 1:11:39.182
Yes, Peng, that's very cool.

1:11:46.057 --> 1:11:47.491
It's not funny.

1:11:47.493 --> 1:11:49.792
Loch Ness Monster?
Chupacabra?

1:11:49.794 --> 1:11:51.961
I mean, what if they exist?

1:11:51.963 --> 1:11:54.864
Oh, my gosh.
My whole life has been a lie.

1:12:00.805 --> 1:12:03.106
Wow. The Himalayas.

1:12:05.110 --> 1:12:07.511
- Whoa.
- Awesome!

1:12:07.513 --> 1:12:09.179
Everest, look.

1:12:09.181 --> 1:12:11.315
Just across that bridge
is home.

1:12:11.317 --> 1:12:14.751
What are we waiting for?
Let's go, let's go!

1:12:18.957 --> 1:12:22.093
Everest! Wait up!

1:12:27.165 --> 1:12:29.799
Oh, no.

1:12:32.771 --> 1:12:34.137
Go! Go back!

1:12:34.139 --> 1:12:35.807
Whoa!

1:12:38.843 --> 1:12:40.109
Go, go, go!

1:12:44.350 --> 1:12:47.083
Whoa!

1:12:49.921 --> 1:12:51.888
Everest, run!

1:12:51.890 --> 1:12:55.060
Go to your mountain now,
before it's too late.

1:12:56.094 --> 1:12:57.193
Captain, hurry.

1:12:57.195 --> 1:12:59.396
Get my yeti! Get him now!

1:13:01.866 --> 1:13:04.067
No, no, no, no, no, no,
you're going the wrong way!

1:13:04.069 --> 1:13:05.935
He's on the move!

1:13:37.436 --> 1:13:40.103
It's amazing.

1:13:40.105 --> 1:13:42.071
Mr. Burnish,
we're missing our chance.

1:13:42.073 --> 1:13:43.975
Load tranq guns.

1:13:45.010 --> 1:13:46.976
Wait! Hold your fire!

1:13:57.222 --> 1:13:59.055
Get back!

1:14:08.233 --> 1:14:10.099
<i>Mr. Burnish!</i>

1:14:10.101 --> 1:14:12.469
Take the shot!

1:14:14.072 --> 1:14:15.272
Oh, no.

1:14:15.274 --> 1:14:18.107
He's defending them.

1:14:18.109 --> 1:14:19.343
Mr. Burnish.

1:14:19.345 --> 1:14:22.180
Mr. Burnish!

1:14:23.649 --> 1:14:26.015
Doctor, I was wrong.

1:14:26.017 --> 1:14:28.217
You were right.

1:14:28.219 --> 1:14:30.354
The yeti must be protected,

1:14:30.356 --> 1:14:34.957
and the best way to protect
the yeti is to let him go.

1:14:36.227 --> 1:14:39.128
We must let him go.

1:14:39.130 --> 1:14:41.498
Captain, order your men
to stow their weapons.

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:43.835
Do it now!

1:14:48.474 --> 1:14:50.274
Hmm.

1:14:50.276 --> 1:14:52.476
Quick!
Mr. Burnish needs help.

1:14:57.215 --> 1:14:58.818
Captain.

1:15:03.389 --> 1:15:04.521
Fire at will.

1:15:04.523 --> 1:15:06.155
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire!

1:15:17.403 --> 1:15:18.903
Everest!

1:15:29.281 --> 1:15:31.013
- No!
- Get the kids! Go!

1:15:31.015 --> 1:15:33.015
- Everest!
- No! No!

1:15:33.017 --> 1:15:35.218
- Stop! Stop!
- Everest!

1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:50.267
I'll make sure the yeti's out.

1:15:50.269 --> 1:15:52.034
No! No!

1:15:53.972 --> 1:15:56.172
You are never going
to escape again.

1:15:56.174 --> 1:15:57.441
Wait, wait, get her!

1:15:57.443 --> 1:15:59.376
Stop it!

1:15:59.378 --> 1:16:02.312
- Yi!
- Yi!

1:16:16.762 --> 1:16:19.329
- No! No! No!
- Yi! No!

1:16:19.331 --> 1:16:22.299
- Well, that's one down.
- Yi!

1:16:22.301 --> 1:16:24.000
- All right, move out.
- Yes, sir.

1:16:24.002 --> 1:16:25.234
Copy that. Moving out.

1:16:25.236 --> 1:16:26.470
- Yes, Captain.
- Go back! No!

1:16:26.472 --> 1:16:28.272
- Go back! Yi!
- Yi!

1:16:28.274 --> 1:16:30.340
Stop the car!

1:18:34.533 --> 1:18:36.266
It's Everest.

1:18:36.268 --> 1:18:37.634
No, this can't be happening!

1:18:41.407 --> 1:18:43.473
- Let's go! - Go, go!
- I'm out of here!

1:18:43.475 --> 1:18:44.641
Sir. Sir, wake up.

1:18:47.580 --> 1:18:49.379
Yi! You're okay.

1:18:49.381 --> 1:18:51.180
Everest!

1:18:55.721 --> 1:18:58.555
I thought we had
to keep the yeti alive.

1:18:58.557 --> 1:19:01.192
Dead will have to do.

1:19:02.494 --> 1:19:04.263
No!

1:19:06.332 --> 1:19:07.666
Yes!

1:19:10.636 --> 1:19:12.404
Uh...

1:19:20.512 --> 1:19:22.314
No!

1:19:24.583 --> 1:19:25.616
Everest?

1:19:36.227 --> 1:19:37.494
Everest?

1:19:45.337 --> 1:19:47.371
Everest?

1:19:47.373 --> 1:19:49.272
You are by far the most
extraordinary creature

1:19:49.274 --> 1:19:51.375
I have ever seen.

1:19:51.377 --> 1:19:54.311
That is exactly why
the world...

1:19:54.313 --> 1:19:57.148
must never know you exist.

1:19:58.651 --> 1:20:00.517
They would not understand.

1:20:00.519 --> 1:20:01.818
I didn't.

1:20:04.456 --> 1:20:07.324
Now, can I please help you
get back to the city?

1:20:07.326 --> 1:20:09.326
Thank you, but...

1:20:09.328 --> 1:20:11.595
I promised
to take Everest home,

1:20:11.597 --> 1:20:13.597
and he's not home yet.

1:20:13.599 --> 1:20:15.832
You're going to take Everest
all the way to Everest?

1:20:15.834 --> 1:20:18.301
That is impossible.

1:20:18.303 --> 1:20:19.569
Sir, with all due respect,

1:20:19.571 --> 1:20:21.605
when Yi sets her mind
on something,

1:20:21.607 --> 1:20:23.640
nothing is impossible.

1:20:23.642 --> 1:20:26.276
Yes.

1:20:26.278 --> 1:20:27.479
It's cold.

1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:30.614
But there is something

1:20:30.616 --> 1:20:33.717
I have to insist
that I give you.

1:20:33.719 --> 1:20:35.719
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- See you later.

1:20:35.721 --> 1:20:37.454
Don't worry.

1:20:37.456 --> 1:20:39.523
I'll be waiting right here.

1:20:39.525 --> 1:20:42.659
They just wanted
our coats, Dave.

1:20:42.661 --> 1:20:47.332
Guys, it sure is
a long way up there.

1:20:48.567 --> 1:20:51.501
Everest?

1:21:03.615 --> 1:21:05.782
- Cool!
- All right.

1:21:05.784 --> 1:21:07.417
Bring it!

1:21:15.527 --> 1:21:16.693
Wow.

1:21:31.844 --> 1:21:33.512
Yeah!

1:21:37.683 --> 1:21:38.815
Whoa!

1:22:02.508 --> 1:22:05.342
Everest, it's your mountain.

1:22:17.790 --> 1:22:19.723
What do we do now?

1:22:19.725 --> 1:22:21.558
I don't know.

1:22:39.578 --> 1:22:42.314
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1:22:50.956 --> 1:22:53.590
His parents.

1:22:53.592 --> 1:22:54.891
Wow.

1:22:54.893 --> 1:22:57.727
They'd be so good
at basketball.

1:23:06.705 --> 1:23:09.773
We're finally home, Everest.

1:23:09.775 --> 1:23:12.611
Home.

1:23:16.415 --> 1:23:17.881
I can't...

1:23:17.883 --> 1:23:19.783
I can't believe
the journey's over.

1:23:40.639 --> 1:23:41.907
You're right.

1:23:43.775 --> 1:23:45.744
It's not over.

1:23:48.647 --> 1:23:50.547
Thank you, Everest.

1:23:53.485 --> 1:23:56.219
I'll never forget you, Everest!

1:25:04.623 --> 1:25:06.089
Goodbye.

1:25:06.091 --> 1:25:08.727
Bye. Thank you.

1:25:21.974 --> 1:25:23.974
- Ma?
- Yi?

1:25:23.976 --> 1:25:25.742
You're back.

1:25:25.744 --> 1:25:27.610
How was the trip?

1:25:27.612 --> 1:25:28.712
Aw.

1:25:30.916 --> 1:25:32.684
Yi?

1:25:33.919 --> 1:25:36.152
I missed you both so much.

1:25:36.154 --> 1:25:40.525
It's good to have you back,
granddaughter.

1:25:42.027 --> 1:25:44.561
Why don't you get that?

1:25:44.563 --> 1:25:46.730
It's probably the boys.

1:25:46.732 --> 1:25:49.799
Who is ready
for Nai Nai's pork buns?

1:25:49.801 --> 1:25:51.634
Look what I found
on your doorstep.

1:25:51.636 --> 1:25:53.103
- It's addressed to all of us.
- Shh!

1:25:53.105 --> 1:25:54.740
Come over here.

1:25:58.577 --> 1:26:00.944
<i>For your next adventure.</i>

1:26:00.946 --> 1:26:02.912
Hey, kids, how was Beijing?

1:26:02.914 --> 1:26:03.947
Peng!

1:26:03.949 --> 1:26:05.949
Oh, it was, um, life-changing.

1:26:05.951 --> 1:26:07.917
Wow. That's great.

1:26:07.919 --> 1:26:09.621
Everybody, dig in.

1:26:11.156 --> 1:26:13.123
Mmm. Wow.

1:26:13.125 --> 1:26:16.126
You know, I totally see what
you mean about these pork buns.

1:26:16.128 --> 1:26:17.894
Uh-huh.

1:26:17.896 --> 1:26:19.662
There is no one in the world

1:26:19.664 --> 1:26:21.998
who likes these pork buns
more than me.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.070
Well... maybe one.

1:26:26.671 --> 1:26:27.937
Who?

1:26:27.939 --> 1:26:29.672
Who else like my buns?

1:26:31.043 --> 1:26:34.077
- No laughing. I'm serious.
- Oh, Nai Nai.
