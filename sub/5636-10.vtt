WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.372
The trick to cereal is
keeping 70% above the milk.

00:04.463 --> 00:07.125
Jerry, get a job.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.752
Uh, w-why
don't you get it, Jerry?

00:08.842 --> 00:11.425
You're the man of the house,
and you don't have a job.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.670
Delivery for Rick.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.343
Morning, Summer, Beth,
and Jerry.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.050
- Gross. What is that thing?
- It's a courier flap.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.475
It's like the intergalactic
version of UPS,

00:20.562 --> 00:22.052
but less off-putting.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.353
Oh, shiiit!

00:23.440 --> 00:25.306
It looks like an egg-vite
from Birdperson.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.482
Must be time
for his annual Oscar party.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.185
And, by the way,
our TV signals take light years

00:29.279 --> 00:30.440
to reach his planet.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.363
Nobody tell him
that "Braveheart" wins.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.360
<i>Greetings.
This is Birdperson.</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:35.612
<i>And Tammy!</i>

<i>if you're from Earth,</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:42.198
<i>that means
we're getting married!</i>

00:42.292 --> 00:44.659
Oh, my God! My friend Tammy's
marrying Birdperson!

00:44.920 --> 00:46.376
What the hell
is a Birdperson?

00:46.463 --> 00:47.669
He's Rick's best
friend.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.334
Uh, l-let's not
get carried away, Morty.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.256
Would you like to RSVP
or send a gift?

00:51.343 --> 00:53.254
No. Weddings are basically
funerals with cake.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.256
If I wanted to watch someone
throw their life away,

00:55.347 --> 00:57.179
I'd hang out with Jerry all day.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.677
Affirmative!
Returning to sender.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.015
No, hold on, stay,
courier flaps.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.809
- Staying!
- Dad, you have a friend...

01:01.895 --> 01:03.806
that's getting married.
That's a big deal.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.683
It's a big deal
he has a friend.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.266
What do you know
about friendship, Jerry?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.942
Confirmed,
shipping Jerry.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.939
- Whoa, whoa, wait! Aah!
- Oh, God! Jerry!

01:12.030 --> 01:13.111
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:13.198 --> 01:15.189
Where is it
taking him?

01:15.284 --> 01:17.150
I assume
planet Squanch --

01:17.244 --> 01:19.110
6,000 light years
across the galaxy.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.694
Whoa, t-that's --
That's insane!

01:20.789 --> 01:23.577
Yeah, I know. Now we have
to go to the wedding.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.627

tedious and worn out,

02:20.515 --> 02:23.473
Beth, Squanchy culture
is more contextual than literal.

Our pleasure.

Yeah, I just hope
you got a pre-meld.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.359

- What?! It's just a practical

03:23.453 --> 03:25.239
way of making sure that
when she's done with you,

you can get
one of your balls back.

- He's grumpy from the flight.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.078
Ohh, I-I was happy
on the flight.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.001
I'm grumpy
from the landing.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.546
Well, I looked
at the guest book.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.794
We don't know
a damn person here.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.966
Hi! Jerry Smith --
Father of the bride's friend.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.260
Advertising is my usual game,
but I'm between --

03:42.347 --> 03:44.088
Jerry, stop networking.
We're in space.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.843
"Jerry, get a job!

03:45.934 --> 03:47.720
Jerry, don't look for a job
at an alien wedding!"

03:47.811 --> 03:49.722
- I don't get you.
- This is the closest...

03:49.813 --> 03:51.554
I've ever gotten to this part
of my father's life.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.434
I don't want
to blow it.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.141
Okay, I get it.
I'm cramping your style.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.102
You say you get it, but
I'm scared you'll keep doing it.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.107
Look, here's some humans
you can practice on.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.109
You must be
Summer's mom and dad.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.861
We're Tammy's parents --
Pat and Donna Guterman.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.201
Hi. Beth.
This is Jerry.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.996
So your teenage daughter's
marrying a Birdman.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.664
Are you guys
<i>down</i> with that?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.333
No pun intended.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.126
We're quite proud.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.374
He's a wonderful person
and an incredible Bird.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.250
Still, what is he, 40?

04:18.341 --> 04:19.502
It's just, you know,

04:19.593 --> 04:21.675
when he was 30,
she was an actual child.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.503
When he was her age,
she wasn't born.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.554
When he was,
let's see, like, 18,

04:25.640 --> 04:28.598
she was literally
in there in your womb.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.301
Imagine being pregnant
with your daughter

04:30.395 --> 04:32.102
and a Bird teenager
comes into your home and says,

04:32.189 --> 04:34.100
"I'll take that.
I'll have sex with that."

04:34.191 --> 04:35.773
Give us one second.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.770
Were you born with your feet
in your mouth?

04:37.861 --> 04:40.603
I was transported here
against my will in a meatball, all right.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.109
So take your attitude
to the men's section of K-Mart,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.612
'cause you need to cut me
some slack...s.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.113
I want you to stand
in the corner

04:47.204 --> 04:48.660
and face the corner
and talk to nobody.

04:48.747 --> 04:52.035
Maybe... I... will.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.036
You know, you're not being
very supportive

04:54.127 --> 04:55.743
of Birdperson
on his big day.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.044
Birdperson's big day,
Morty,

04:58.131 --> 05:01.465
was at Blood Ridge
on Glapflap's third moon

05:01.551 --> 05:03.337
against
the Gromflamites!

05:03.428 --> 05:05.669
This?
This is a losing battle.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.675
Geez, Rick,
it's not like he's dying.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.222
He's getting married!

05:09.309 --> 05:10.640
I mean, what do you think's
gonna happen

05:10.727 --> 05:12.343
if you open yourself up
a little bit?

05:12.437 --> 05:13.802
I mean, look around.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.685
This is your family and friends
all around you, you know?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.265
Take the day off.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.317
There's nothing to run from,
nothing to fight.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.314
That's his last name.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.440
Are you
hyphenating it?

05:23.532 --> 05:24.738
Squanch this, mo-fo.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.283
Good one, Morty.
Excuse me, bartender.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.281
Can you make me
a dumb grandson pep talk?

05:30.372 --> 05:33.364
It's one part lame advice about
stuff you know nothing about

05:33.458 --> 05:34.823
and a <i>lot</i> of vodka.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.625
Mm-Hmm.
I have a lot of vodka.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.542
Then I'll take
one of those.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.165
I don't need the rest.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.338
God, whatever, Rick.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.882
It sounds like you and my dad
have a long history together.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.551
Wish I could say
the same.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.548
The road your father and I
walked together

05:47.639 --> 05:51.507
is soaked deeply with the blood
of both friends and enemies.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.591
Must be nice.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.643
Um, I used to
have to draw him

05:54.729 --> 05:56.345
into family photos
with a crayon.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.851
The war in which we fought
is far from over.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.478
We live our lives
in hiding.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.685
I guess I should
be happy for you.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.316
I mean, great,
you guys got to hang out.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.863
I hope you had
a blast.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.442
The galactic government
considers us terrorists.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.823
It's unwise of me
to share these details,

06:11.913 --> 06:13.403
but I've
become inebriated.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.738
I don't know
if you can appreciate

06:14.833 --> 06:16.995
what it means to grow up
without a father, but --

06:17.252 --> 06:18.788
The guest list
at this wedding

06:18.879 --> 06:21.621
includes 17 of the Federation's
most wanted.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.626
We have committed
numerous atrocities

06:23.717 --> 06:25.299
in the name of freedom.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.671
Annnd during that time,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.422
I don't suppose he
ever mentioned his daughter.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.878
Are those baby quiches?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.338
Night crawler pate.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.390
I should prepare
for the ceremony.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.433
Like talking
to a brick wall.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.895
In the name of the squanch,
the six rivers,

06:38.982 --> 06:40.893
the four squanches,
and the nine balls,

06:40.984 --> 06:45.273
I unite these two organisms
in eternal squanch!

06:45.363 --> 06:47.400
Tammy, you may
squanch your vows now.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.902
Birdperson...

06:49.993 --> 06:53.907
You are my seed,
my worm, my earliness,

06:53.997 --> 06:55.658
and my lack of cats.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.161
I promise to be yours
until your death.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.491
- Nice!
- Aww!

06:59.586 --> 07:00.951
Birdperson.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.879
Tammy, I was approaching
infertility when I met you,

07:03.965 --> 07:05.626
but there is still time.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.333
I am yours
until my death.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.838
Aww!

07:08.929 --> 07:10.761
Aww.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.805
I now pronounce you
Squanch and Birdperson!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.641
♪ <i>Girl, you got it going on</i> ♪

07:27.322 --> 07:29.563
I am not staring at you.

07:29.658 --> 07:32.650
I am a cyborg photographer.
Just act natural.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.451
This is a candid shot.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.574
I don't require
a camera so --

07:36.665 --> 07:38.406
Sorry.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.366
Hi.
I am not staring at you...

07:46.341 --> 07:47.831
Uh, hi, everybody.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.587
I'm Rick.

07:49.678 --> 07:54.593
You know, when I first
met Birdperson, he was, uhh...

07:54.683 --> 07:56.344
Listen, I'm not the nicest guy
in the universe

07:56.434 --> 07:57.674
because I'm the smartest.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.476
And being nice is something
stupid people do

07:59.562 --> 08:00.893
to hedge their bets.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.346
Now, I haven't been
exactly subtle

08:02.440 --> 08:03.771
about how little
I trust marriage.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.144
I couldn't make it work,

08:05.402 --> 08:06.767
and I could turn a black hole
into a sun,

08:06.861 --> 08:08.818
so at a certain point,
you got to ask yourself

08:08.905 --> 08:10.691
what are the odds
this is legit

08:10.782 --> 08:12.443
and not just some big lie
we're all telling ourselves

08:12.534 --> 08:13.990
because we're afraid
to die alone?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.819
Because, you know, that's
exactly how we all die -- alone.

08:16.913 --> 08:17.869
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, Dad.

08:17.956 --> 08:18.991
Jesus.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.039
But -- But...
here's the thing.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.992
Birdperson is my best friend,

08:23.086 --> 08:25.828
and if he loves Tammy, well,
then I love Tammy, too.

08:28.675 --> 08:32.384
To friendship, to love, and
to my greatest adventure yet --

08:32.470 --> 08:34.711
Opening myself up
to others.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.261
Hear, hear!
Cheers!

08:36.349 --> 08:38.260
Cheers to that,
motherfucker!

08:38.351 --> 08:41.013
Thank you, Rick.
That was beautiful.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.392
Gosh, I look around this room,
and I think,

08:44.482 --> 08:46.268
"Uh, Tammy,
you're a high-school senior

08:46.359 --> 08:47.895
from the planet Earth,
and you're marrying

08:47.986 --> 08:50.569
a 40-year-old Birdperson?
Like, what?!"

08:51.656 --> 08:52.987
Yeah, Tammy!

08:53.074 --> 08:55.691
But then I think, you know,
in a lot of ways,

08:55.785 --> 08:58.698
I'm <i>not</i> a high-school senior
from the planet Earth.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.950
In a lot of ways,
what I really am

09:01.041 --> 09:03.908
is a deep-cover agent
for the Galactic Federation,

09:04.002 --> 09:06.039
and you guys are
a group of wanted criminals,

09:06.129 --> 09:09.042
and this entire building is,
in a certain sense, surrounded.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.873
Oh, shit.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.299
- I... don't get the metaphor.
- I'll explain it to you later.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.047
Everyone here is
under arrest

09:15.138 --> 09:16.845
for crimes
against the Federation.

09:16.931 --> 09:17.921
<i>L'chaim!</i>

09:18.016 --> 09:21.225
- Tammy, what are you doing?
- Sit your Bird ass down.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.310
Tammy?

09:25.148 --> 09:27.731
Birdperson!!
No!!

09:31.863 --> 09:32.944
Holy --

09:41.122 --> 09:43.113
Drop the portal gun.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.199
Slide it to
the center of the room.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.124
Somebody confiscate that
and don't damage it.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.671
They'll want it at --

10:14.239 --> 10:15.650
There's no time
to squanch!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.572
Get your family
out of here!

10:17.659 --> 10:19.525
I got this.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.123
How about a taste
of my squanch?!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.416
Come on, this way!

10:32.507 --> 10:34.214
Squanch this!

10:42.475 --> 10:44.466
Good thing I grabbed
a space weapon.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.393
That's a confetti gun,
you fucking idiot!

10:46.479 --> 10:48.516
- Dad!
- Hold on tight!

10:51.067 --> 10:52.478
Aaah!!

10:56.322 --> 10:58.063
Aaaah!!

11:00.285 --> 11:01.946
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it!!

11:08.084 --> 11:10.041
What the hell happened
back there?!

11:10.128 --> 11:12.836
This is on you guys.
I told you weddings are stupid.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.879
Uh, Rick, is there anything
you'd like to tell us

11:17.969 --> 11:20.006
about your relationship

11:20.096 --> 11:23.009
with this previously unknown
galactic government?

11:23.099 --> 11:25.181
All the important points
seem pretty clear, no?

11:25.268 --> 11:27.430
They think they control
the galaxy, I disagree.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.431
Don't hate the player,
hate the game, son.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.638
How could you be so dishonest
with this family?

11:31.733 --> 11:33.849
Oh! Oh, should I have been
more open and trusting

11:33.943 --> 11:35.183
and loving like,
oh, I don't know,

11:35.278 --> 11:38.020
my now dead best friend?
Or your daughter,

11:38.114 --> 11:40.651
who is BFFs
with an intergalactic narc?

11:40.742 --> 11:41.903
Hey, Tammy was cool!

11:41.993 --> 11:44.030
- And now we know why.
- Because of you!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.952
Fuck you, Summer,
and fuck the government,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.825
and fuck me
for letting my guard down,

11:47.916 --> 11:49.452
which I will <i>never</i>
do again.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.907
Geez, Rick!

11:51.002 --> 11:53.664
You can't say f--
"'F' you" to your granddaughter.

11:53.755 --> 11:56.213
I just did, Morty.
Here's dessert. Fuck you.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.915
Look, I think we've all had
a tough wedding.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.750
Actually,
the wedding was beautiful.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.005
The reception got
out of hand.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.211
Anyway, I say we go home,
sleep it off,

12:03.306 --> 12:05.092
and have a family meeting
in the morning.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.220
Yeah, about going home,
we can't -- ever.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.766
What?!

12:08.853 --> 12:10.139
Oh, these guys are
looking for us now.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.595
Earth will be swarming
with them.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.724
Us?!

12:12.815 --> 12:14.101
- Jerry --
- I want to go home!

12:14.192 --> 12:16.274
Look, anyone that wants
to go back to Earth is free to.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.193
But here's
what's gonna happen.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.769
Alien bureaucrats are gonna
arrest you.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.650
They're gonna put
the intergalactic equivalent

12:21.741 --> 12:24.199
of jumper cables
under your nuts and or labia

12:24.285 --> 12:26.026
and hook them up
to an alien car battery

12:26.120 --> 12:27.610
until you tell them
where I am --

12:27.705 --> 12:29.321
Which I guarantee you,
you're not gonna know,

12:29.415 --> 12:31.372
which I guarantee
they won't believe.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.242
So who's homesick?
By applause.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.668
Ladies? Anybody?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.497
What are we going to do?
Where are we going to live?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.753
Take it easy.
This is a blessing in disguise.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.208
Fuck Earth.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.135
You realize our planet's name
means dirt, right?

12:44.222 --> 12:45.712
We'll find a new world.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.093
Computer, how many planets
in the Milky Way

12:47.183 --> 12:49.094
are at least 90% similar
to Earth?

12:49.185 --> 12:52.723
<i>765 known planets.</i>

12:52.814 --> 12:55.181
How many of those are outside
federal jurisdiction?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.516
<i>Three.</i>

12:57.610 --> 12:59.726
See?
Our cup runneth over.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.027
Now, who wants
to go shopping

13:01.114 --> 13:03.196
for a brand-new
motherfucking world?!

13:03.283 --> 13:04.364
All right!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.282
Look at this baby!

13:06.369 --> 13:08.076
Would you even know
that wasn't Earth?

13:08.162 --> 13:09.994
Yes, because
there's no Africa.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.072
Pssh. White people
problems, Morty.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.282
Let's go down
and check her out.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.086
Oh. I thought
it was further away.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.664
I uh... I guess this one's
a little small.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.123
All right, uh, maybe --

13:22.218 --> 13:24.050
Maybe we should go check out
the other two, huh?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.264
Okay,
this one's bigger.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.310
This looks nice.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.887
Mom, Dad, look!

13:35.982 --> 13:37.643
Strawberries on a cob!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.851
Whoa!
Hey, check this out!

13:40.945 --> 13:42.606
Flowers on a cob!

13:42.697 --> 13:45.940
Huh. Strawberries and flowers
on a cob, huh?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.240
That's pretty cool.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.819
Are those...
mountains on a cob?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.323
Oh, my God.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.461
- Get in the ship, sweetie.
- What?

14:00.715 --> 14:01.796
Get in
the goddamn ship!!

14:01.883 --> 14:03.123
<i>Everything's</i> on a cob!!

14:03.217 --> 14:05.754
The whole planet's on a cob!!
Go, go, go!!

14:08.681 --> 14:11.048
All right,
third time's the charm.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.132
See what we got here.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.970
Seems good.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.430
And nothing
on the cob.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.265
Didn't know that was
a necessity, but...

14:20.360 --> 14:22.442
No, it's nice.
I think this might be it.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.269
Wow!
Hey, look, you guys.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.105
The sun's rising.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.816
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!

14:31.162 --> 14:33.870
Uh, Dad, how long are the days
on this planet?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.197
Uh, computer, how long
are the days on this planet?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.618
<i>42 hours.</i>

14:39.712 --> 14:41.749
All right, well,
those are the two choices,

14:41.839 --> 14:43.671
'cause cob planet is
off the table.

14:43.758 --> 14:44.873
Now let's take a vote.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.549
<i>Well, it's official.</i>

14:46.803 --> 14:48.669
<i>The obscure planet
known as Earth,</i>

14:48.763 --> 14:51.505
<i>formerly the hiding place
of interstellar terrorist</i>

14:51.766 --> 14:53.507
<i>and fugitive Rick Sanchez,</i>

14:53.768 --> 14:56.726
<i>has just become
the 6,048th planet</i>

14:56.813 --> 14:58.395
<i>to join
the Galactic Federation.</i>

14:58.481 --> 15:00.563
<i>The plucky little ball
of water and dirt,</i>

15:00.817 --> 15:02.307
<i>which is where
it gets its name,</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:06.066
<i>is dominated by seven billion
primate-descended natives</i>

15:06.155 --> 15:10.114
<i>who love to eat spaghetti
and pray to kangaroos.</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:12.989
<i>Spaghetti, kangaroos?
I've gotta check this place out.</i>

15:13.079 --> 15:15.821
<i>Well, you can.</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:18.077
<i>Contact the Ministry of Tourism
for details.</i>

15:18.167 --> 15:20.249
<i>Up next,
teenagers are calling it</i>

15:22.463 --> 15:24.249
<i>And it's not
what you think.</i>

15:24.340 --> 15:25.671
What are you --
What did you do that for?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.044
Dramatic effect.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.672
Good morning, family.
Oh, do I smell bacon?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.673
Yes, we discovered
a species of tiny pig

15:31.764 --> 15:33.801
off the coast
of New Australia

15:33.891 --> 15:36.053
- about 30 yards east.
- Or 300 yards west.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.430
We'd offer you some,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.852
but we hunted it to extinction
for breakfast.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.680
Well, I thought
I'd walk to the South Pole

15:41.774 --> 15:43.515
and do a little bit
of exploring.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.020
If you guys need me,
just yell

15:45.111 --> 15:46.272
or throw something
so hard

15:46.362 --> 15:47.978
that it goes around the world
and hits me.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.562
Okay, now that he's gone,

15:49.657 --> 15:52.069
can we please talk about
our situation?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.151
Dad, you can't talk about people
behind their back.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.576
You know,
it's a small world.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.161
Please,
he's in the South Pole!

15:57.248 --> 15:59.615
And we need to have
a serious conversation.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.920
South Pole discovered,
baby!

16:14.015 --> 16:15.756
Ohhhh!

16:15.850 --> 16:17.716
Oh fuck! An ice cave?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.016
Shit!

16:19.103 --> 16:21.720
Things just keep on
getting better.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.101
Wow, it's
the planet's core.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.728
I'm just saying,

16:25.818 --> 16:27.900
we keep acting
like there's only two options,

16:27.987 --> 16:29.318
but there's not.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.191
So, yes, if we went
back to Earth,

16:31.282 --> 16:33.774
as long as Rick was out there,
they'd wanna interrogate us.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.984
But, and this is
purely hypothetical,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.490
what if we turned your father in
to the government?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.742
Jerry, so help me God,

16:39.832 --> 16:41.789
if you ever bring this up again,
no more bacon.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.412
There already
is no more bacon!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.915
This world sucks!
Our life sucks!

16:46.005 --> 16:47.746
Why are we doing this
for someone

16:47.840 --> 16:51.299
that would <i>never</i> do anything
for anyone but himself?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.046
That's not the point, Dad!

16:53.137 --> 16:56.050
We love Rick...
f-for the most part.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.222
Yeah, you don't love
people in hopes of a reward,

16:58.309 --> 17:00.346
Dad, you love them
unconditionally.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.393
That's very good, kids.
I'm proud of you.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.096
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.351
For the rest
of your lives,

17:05.441 --> 17:07.057
no matter
how much it hurts you,

17:07.151 --> 17:09.267
no matter how much it
destroys our children's futures,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.069
we're gonna do whatever
Rick wants, whenever he wants?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.942
- Yes.
- Why?!

17:14.032 --> 17:16.616
Because I don't want him to
leave again, you dumb asshole!!

17:26.087 --> 17:28.124
Hey. Uh...

17:28.214 --> 17:30.546
I was gonna hope over
to the Gloppydrop system,

17:30.633 --> 17:32.044
get some ice cream.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.716
You -- You want me
to come with?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.382
Don't you need my brain waves
for camouflage or something?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.554
I'll be okay.
Bye, Morty.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.257
Rick?

17:40.351 --> 17:42.092
You're not leaving,
right?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.018
Yeah, I am.
To get ice cream.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.641
So, you're
coming back?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.938
Morty, if you go to where
there's a bunch of ice cream

17:48.025 --> 17:49.186
and then
you don't come back,

17:49.277 --> 17:50.859
you haven't
actually gotten ice cream,

17:50.945 --> 17:53.107
you've just gone
where ice cream is.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.234
Rick, I can handle it
if you go,

17:55.324 --> 17:57.156
but you'll
break Mom's heart.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.859
And I won't forgive you
for that.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.240
Where's the van,
Morty?

18:01.330 --> 18:04.163
It's over the horizon
in the driveway.

and he left us
on Dwarf Terrace-9.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.449

my family have a normal life?
