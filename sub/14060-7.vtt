00:00.001 --> 00:02.034
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>when calls the heart...</i>

00:02.036 --> 00:03.502
He's not the man
you think he is.

00:03.504 --> 00:05.004
[elizabeth]: Can I make
my own judgments

00:05.006 --> 00:05.971
When a man
shows some interest in me?

00:05.973 --> 00:07.206
I'm going to steal her heart.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.941
"my love is like
a red, red rose."

00:08.943 --> 00:10.576
It's from a robert burns poem.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.852
"there's triumph
in the anvil's stroke.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.620
"there's merit
in the brave and strong,

00:21.622 --> 00:24.456
Who dig the mine
or fell the oak."

00:24.458 --> 00:26.158
That's very nice, gabe.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.860
"the...

00:27.862 --> 00:29.161
"the...

00:29.163 --> 00:30.863
"no... Ba...

00:30.865 --> 00:31.864
[kids giggling]

00:31.866 --> 00:32.865
"bau..."

00:32.867 --> 00:33.866
Where are you
reading from, bo?

00:33.868 --> 00:36.068
"no-ba-ba" ain't a word.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.970
You know you're excused
from having to read aloud

00:37.972 --> 00:39.371
In your group.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.406
James told me

00:40.408 --> 00:42.107
It ain't fair
you have me skip.

00:42.109 --> 00:43.142
It ain't, miss thatcher.

00:44.244 --> 00:45.978
In my classroom,

00:45.980 --> 00:47.980
I get to determine what's fair
and what isn't fair.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.616
How about showing
some compassion?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.918
You know bo just started up
at school again

00:52.920 --> 00:54.086
After a long absence.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.054
It ain't my fault

00:55.056 --> 00:56.321
The old teacher told him
to stay home

00:56.323 --> 00:58.123
Because
he can't read.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.625
Well, your old teacher
isn't in charge anymore.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.427
I am.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.530
Yes, ma'am.

01:06.099 --> 01:10.269
[♪]

01:21.448 --> 01:23.015
I was just
at the mercantile,

01:23.017 --> 01:24.116
And ned yost asked

01:24.118 --> 01:26.018
If I wouldn't mind
dropping this off to you.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.119
That's very kind
of you, thank you.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.456
You didn't have to go
to that trouble.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.658
No trouble.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.227
I do hope it's
what I think it is.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.595
[gasps] it is.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.497
"the compendium
of brain disorders

01:38.499 --> 01:39.965
And neurology,"

01:39.967 --> 01:43.135
"congenital word blindness..."

01:43.137 --> 01:46.004
Ooh, "strephosymbolia
and reading strategies."

01:46.006 --> 01:48.006
Well, I can't say
I got a word of that.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.441
This just couldn't have come
at a better time.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.610
I wrote to one of
my old professors,

01:51.612 --> 01:52.945
Dr. Henshelwood,

01:52.947 --> 01:54.113
About one of my students.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.080
He's done work with children
with reading troubles

01:55.082 --> 01:58.016
That is absolutely
revolutionary.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.485
I thought he had
forgotten all about me.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.320
You're not an easy person
to forget.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.257
Thank you...

02:05.259 --> 02:06.358
[quietly] I think.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.229
Jack, I...

02:11.431 --> 02:14.166
I feel really... Bad...

02:14.168 --> 02:15.534
About everything that...

02:15.536 --> 02:16.535
Happened.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.338
You know,
with billy?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.206
No.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.008
You don't have any reason
to feel bad.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.110
Billy hamilton
was a con man.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.979
He was a professional
manipulator.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.114
That's true.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.717
And I was duped by him.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.019
But I finally
saw through his charade--

02:34.021 --> 02:35.654
I don't want you
to blame yourself.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.989
For falling under his spell.

02:36.991 --> 02:40.993
Well, I didn't exactly
fall under his spell...

02:40.995 --> 02:42.060
No, no,

02:42.062 --> 02:44.463
What I meant was,
he fooled you.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.333
I'm not saying
that you're a fool...

02:48.335 --> 02:49.334
Exactly--

02:49.336 --> 02:51.603
Then what are you saying...

02:51.605 --> 02:53.038
Exactly?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.139
No, I-I'm just saying that

02:54.141 --> 02:56.408
Women of a certain age
are an easy mark...

02:56.410 --> 02:58.677
Now you're calling me
desperate?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.711
What? No.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.180
I would really love
to sit and chat

03:01.182 --> 03:02.481
About my many weaknesses,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.483
But, as you can see, I have
quite a lot of work to do.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.351
I'm just trying to help you.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.221
I'm just trying to
speak to you as a friend.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.623
Thank you
for bringing the package.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.793
I hope you have a nice day.

03:23.536 --> 03:27.406
[♪]

03:35.715 --> 03:37.649
[elizabeth]:
He is absolutely impertinent.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.551
I mean yes, he saw through
that con man first,

03:39.553 --> 03:42.354
And, yes, I was fooled
by him for a while, but--

03:42.356 --> 03:43.355
Elizabeth,

03:43.357 --> 03:45.457
Maybe it's not jack
you're mad at.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.559
Maybe your pride
is a bit bruised.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.262
You have every reason
to be angry at the situation.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.697
I'm not angry.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.233
Clearly.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.570
[sighs]

03:58.572 --> 03:59.805
Jack seems to
take pleasure

03:59.807 --> 04:01.406
In reminding me
how inane I was.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.142
He even implied that I was
so desperate to find a husband,

04:04.144 --> 04:05.744
That I couldn't think straight.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.681
Mm.

04:09.683 --> 04:10.716
This is amazing.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.117
If I keep living here,

04:12.119 --> 04:14.086
I'm going to bust out of
my clothes altogether.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.287
My grandmother's recipe.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.656
He's made it perfectly clear
that, as a mountie,

04:17.658 --> 04:19.091
He's not interested in
committing to a woman,

04:19.093 --> 04:21.193
So I don't understand
why he's taken such an interest

04:21.195 --> 04:22.694
In my love life.

04:22.696 --> 04:23.762
Hmm.

04:26.566 --> 04:28.133
These are heavenly.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.735
Have another.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.103
Mm...

04:31.105 --> 04:32.237
I couldn't.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.307
Maybe just one more.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.613
You know, abigail,

04:41.615 --> 04:44.416
My family has employed
some of the best chefs

04:44.418 --> 04:46.318
From some of the finest
culinary schools,

04:46.320 --> 04:49.521
And your scones and pies
are lighter and tastier

04:49.523 --> 04:51.623
Than any I ever had at home.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.858
Do you really think so?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.526
I know so.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.796
Noah did love my baking.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.564
I took great pride

04:59.566 --> 05:02.434
In cooking for him
and my son, peter.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.504
And they did often brag
to others about my cooking,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.739
But they only had me
to compare to.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.207
I mean, certainly not

05:09.209 --> 05:11.877
That fancy, big-city food
you're talking about.

05:11.879 --> 05:15.514
Well, trust me,
they were right,

05:15.516 --> 05:19.951
Whether in the big city,
or here coal valley.

05:24.624 --> 05:28.527
Bo, someone's here to see you.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.228
Miss thatcher?

05:31.497 --> 05:32.664
If this is about my homework,

05:32.666 --> 05:33.765
I'm real sorry.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.367
It's taking me longer
than I thought it would,

05:35.369 --> 05:37.602
And I promise
I'll get it by tomorrow.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.504
I've already spoken
with your parents.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.839
I'd like for you

05:40.841 --> 05:42.174
To stay after school
one day this week

05:42.176 --> 05:43.342
To take a special test.

05:43.344 --> 05:44.409
[bo's father]: It's nothin'
you need to do, son,

05:44.411 --> 05:45.410
If you don't want to.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.411
You know when you turn 15,

05:46.413 --> 05:48.447
You've got a job
in the mine, with me.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.581
Carl, we agreed.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.683
One little test
won't hurt anything.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.218
I suppose.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.886
Thank you,
mr. Grady.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.555
You won't regret this.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.857
Miss thatcher,
this is coal valley.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.826
Bo's future is in that mine,

06:00.828 --> 06:01.860
And he don't need to read

06:01.862 --> 06:03.362
To make a name for himself
down there.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.330
What kind of test?

06:05.332 --> 06:06.365
Don't worry, bo.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.699
It's nothing
you need to study for.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.768
Okay. If you think I should.

06:23.249 --> 06:26.017
Bo...

06:28.554 --> 06:29.688
These are beautiful.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.358
Did you make these?

06:33.360 --> 06:34.559
Yup.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.594
From scratch?

06:35.596 --> 06:37.596
Yes, ma'am.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.297
Who taught you?

06:39.299 --> 06:41.566
Nobody.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.902
I just see them in newspapers
and magazines,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.337
And then I make them.

06:45.339 --> 06:49.541
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like them.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.576
You're very talented, bo.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.011
Thank you, ma'am.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.269
Good evening!

07:17.271 --> 07:18.270
Oh!

07:18.272 --> 07:19.337
Oh, abigail.

07:20.406 --> 07:21.706
Good evening, jack.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.042
What used to be here?

07:24.044 --> 07:27.479
Oh, it was, um, a cafe.

07:28.481 --> 07:29.815
There was a time

07:29.817 --> 07:31.917
When all the single miners
would eat their meals here.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.586
It was food without the drink
of the saloon, but...

07:34.588 --> 07:37.422
The food wasn't much better,

07:37.424 --> 07:38.590
And henry gowen
shut it down.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.059
Well, more profit in drink
than food I suppose.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.027
[chuckles]

07:42.029 --> 07:43.094
Exactly.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.767
Uh...

07:48.769 --> 07:50.735
Is there something else?

07:54.540 --> 07:55.640
Actually, I was wondering

07:55.642 --> 07:56.942
If you could
help me with something.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.744
Well, I'm happy to, if I can.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.682
If...

08:03.684 --> 08:08.954
Let's say a bear saved a deer
from a skunk--

08:08.956 --> 08:10.889
A skunk who had
every intention

08:10.891 --> 08:13.024
Of hurting her,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.960
Why...

08:14.962 --> 08:17.796
Why then would the deer
be angry at the bear?

08:18.865 --> 08:23.068
Perhaps
the deer's pride is hurt.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.103
Maybe seeing the bear
reminds her

08:25.105 --> 08:28.073
That she was silly enough
to trust a skunk.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.774
Hmm. I see...

08:29.776 --> 08:31.610
Furthermore,

08:31.612 --> 08:33.745
The bear was saving the deer
from an untrustworthy animal,

08:33.747 --> 08:35.780
But didn't seem to have
any interest

08:35.782 --> 08:37.983
In replacing him.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.885
I've lost you.

08:39.887 --> 08:40.986
Jack,

08:40.988 --> 08:43.822
Billy was not
the right man for elizabeth.

08:43.824 --> 08:47.359
He was, indeed,
a skunk,

08:47.361 --> 08:48.693
But, one day,

08:48.695 --> 08:49.828
There will be

08:49.830 --> 08:51.096
An appropriate man,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.565
A good man,

08:53.567 --> 08:56.368
Who will approach elizabeth
with honorable intentions,

08:56.370 --> 08:57.502
And then she will be taken.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.474
Perhaps approach her

09:02.476 --> 09:05.644
Not as a constable
who's there to rescue her,

09:05.646 --> 09:08.847
But as a man.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.163
Can I help you, constable?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.932
Actually,
it's just jack tonight,

09:26.934 --> 09:29.534
As you can see.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.669
I stand corrected.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.405
How is your reading student
coming along?

09:33.407 --> 09:36.841
Still working on it.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.712
Elizabeth,
I was thinking.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.713
I do not see you
very often

09:41.715 --> 09:43.582
Since I moved out of
the saloon.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.083
I miss our friendship.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.921
And I was wondering
if you might be inclined

09:49.923 --> 09:51.056
To having supper with me.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.528
To be clear,

09:56.530 --> 09:58.063
When you say
you'd like to have supper,

09:58.065 --> 10:00.031
You mean you'd like to
come to my house

10:00.033 --> 10:02.000
Where I will be the one
doing the cooking?

10:02.002 --> 10:02.968
Oh, no.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.836
No, why would you think that?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.772
So, what then?

10:07.774 --> 10:08.840
Chili and corn bread

10:08.842 --> 10:10.442
Here at the saloon?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.777
Yeah.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.847
No.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.948
Uh...

10:16.950 --> 10:18.550
I guess I hadn't really
thought it through.

10:19.752 --> 10:20.986
Well, I would love to,

10:20.988 --> 10:23.488
But I'm very busy with work,

10:23.490 --> 10:25.056
And I was planning on
cleaning out my closet.

10:25.058 --> 10:28.159
Well, I didn't tell you
which night I was considering.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.161
Of course. I'm sorry.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.630
How about Friday night?

10:31.632 --> 10:32.697
Actually,

10:32.699 --> 10:34.065
That's the very night

10:34.067 --> 10:35.600
I was planning on
cleaning out my closet.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.005
I see.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.007
Well, maybe another time.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.241
Good evening.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.944
[sighs]

10:45.946 --> 10:49.714
Jack...

10:54.053 --> 10:55.754
On second thought,

10:55.756 --> 10:58.189
I actually really could
use your help

10:58.191 --> 10:59.190
With one of my students.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.826
Yeah. Of course.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.561
Why don't you meet me
here tomorrow night?

11:03.563 --> 11:07.098
I'll even share
a bowl of chili with you.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.611
[gowen]: You can't be serious,
mrs. Stanton.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.913
I'm absolutely serious.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.983
A cafe serving
sandwiches, soups, teas,

11:24.985 --> 11:26.918
Baked goods,
and other confections.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.853
Many of the new miners
are single

11:28.855 --> 11:30.055
And have no one
to cook for them.

11:30.057 --> 11:33.258
The saloon's plenty
for a town this size.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.592
People need variety,

11:34.594 --> 11:37.696
A place to gather
to break bread together.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.767
Mr. Gowen,

11:42.769 --> 11:44.169
I believe this cafe

11:44.171 --> 11:47.706
Can get people to spend
their money in town.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.177
Make me an offer.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.215
I'm prepared to offer you
25% of the profits.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.317
I will fix the place up myself.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.119
You fix up the place yourself,

12:01.121 --> 12:02.787
You take 25% of the profits,

12:02.789 --> 12:04.689
75% comes to the company.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.024
[sighs]

12:06.026 --> 12:08.226
50-50.

12:09.929 --> 12:11.329
50-50 it is.

12:13.032 --> 12:14.866
But I want your row house.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.570
I have new miners' families
coming into town,

12:18.572 --> 12:19.637
And I don't have

12:19.639 --> 12:21.306
Any place to put them.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.342
Mr. Gowen, that's my home,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.244
Where I lived
with my husband,

12:26.246 --> 12:28.046
Where my son was raised.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.981
Well, there's two rooms
above the cafe.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.216
You can live there.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.920
Those are my terms.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.889
I'll give you
a week to decide,

12:37.891 --> 12:41.159
But then the offer's
off the table.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.062
Now, if you'd excuse me,
I have work to do.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.266
These scones
aren't half bad.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.185
[sighing]

13:16.729 --> 13:18.863
Good evening,
miss thatcher.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.999
Evening.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.801
Thank you for coming.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.636
You're welcome.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.204
Please, sit here,
across from me.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.406
I thought that we were...

13:28.408 --> 13:29.874
We were going to have
some dinner together

13:29.876 --> 13:30.875
We will.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.977
But you said
you wanted to be friends,

13:32.979 --> 13:35.847
And right now I could use
a friend to help me with this

13:35.849 --> 13:37.348
Right.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.385
Right.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.959
I'm going to be administering
an intelligence test.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.394
The research shows that

13:49.396 --> 13:51.663
Some of the smartest students
are also the slowest readers--

13:51.665 --> 13:53.998
And my taking this test
helps you how?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.934
I need someone to practice on.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.001
You'll be my guinea pig.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.169
Guinea pig?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.204
Yes.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.371
Now scientists
are using guinea pigs

14:00.373 --> 14:01.773
For their experimentation.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.210
All right.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.678
It's a written test,

14:06.680 --> 14:07.779
But I'd like to open
with a question

14:07.781 --> 14:10.682
To assess
your basic comprehension level.

14:10.684 --> 14:11.749
Mm-mm.

14:11.751 --> 14:12.884
I want to make sure

14:12.886 --> 14:16.254
You can follow
simple instructions.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.923
Okay.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.195
Pay me a compliment.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.698
I don't understand.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.399
It's a simple test

14:28.401 --> 14:30.101
To determine whether
you can follow directions.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.903
Oh.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.905
I see.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.044
I admire...

14:40.046 --> 14:41.980
How dedicated you are
to your students.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.250
Not good?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.919
There is no good or bad,

14:47.921 --> 14:49.087
It's only an opportunity

14:49.089 --> 14:50.421
To assess your ability
to follow directions--

14:50.423 --> 14:52.824
No, no, I want to
change my answer.

14:54.326 --> 14:57.795
Well, that's very unorthodox,
but you may.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.068
You look
really beautiful tonight.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.308
Very good.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.815
Please take your pencil,
turn over your pages and begin.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.418
You will have one hour
to complete the test...

15:22.054 --> 15:23.288
And then we can have dinner.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.929
Come on.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.163
What?

15:32.165 --> 15:34.065
Really?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.400
It will show your ability to...

15:35.402 --> 15:37.969
To "perform prehension
provoked by visual perception."

15:37.971 --> 15:40.772
That's a lot of p-words
I didn't quite grasp.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.875
Well, here's another
p-word for you.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.343
Please?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.477
Just do as I ask.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.583
[sighing]

15:59.224 --> 16:01.492
"but when he called
on melly gray,

16:01.494 --> 16:02.393
"she made him
quite a scoff,

16:02.395 --> 16:03.394
"and when she saw
his wooden legs,

16:03.396 --> 16:05.930
Began to take them off..."

16:05.932 --> 16:06.998
You were right.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.234
There was a bird's nest
in the flue.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.036
We were afraid
to light the stove

16:12.038 --> 16:13.972
When we heard the chirping.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.206
Did you save
the baby birds?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.874
They didn't get hurt
when you moved them,

16:16.876 --> 16:18.009
Did they?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.277
Oh, no, no.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.578
I put them in the oak tree
by the well.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.447
Safe and sound.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.915
We are so grateful.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.850
This is the kind of thing
adam would have taken care of.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.518
My daddy
can do anything.

16:28.921 --> 16:31.422
Well, you all must miss him
very much.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.026
[sighs]

16:35.028 --> 16:36.327
The blessing of fire.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.062
Thank you,
constable.

16:38.064 --> 16:40.398
Mama says daddy will be home
in one or two weeks.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.267
Well, that's...
That's very good news.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.402
All right,

16:44.404 --> 16:46.237
Let's let mountie jack
get back to his work.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.973
Let's go upstairs
and do your schoolwork.

16:48.975 --> 16:49.907
Yes, mama.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.275
Yes, mama.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.048
I feel almost selfish
saying this,

16:57.050 --> 17:00.051
When so many families have lost
their husbands and fathers,

17:00.053 --> 17:01.319
But...

17:01.321 --> 17:03.888
When we get adam back,

17:03.890 --> 17:05.957
I don't think I'll ever let him
leave this house again.

17:05.959 --> 17:07.158
[chuckles]

17:07.160 --> 17:08.926
Well, I can understand that.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.461
When you almost lose
someone you care about,

17:10.463 --> 17:11.596
You realize

17:11.598 --> 17:14.532
All those little arguments

17:14.534 --> 17:16.534
Over simple things,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.469
Meaningless things,

17:18.471 --> 17:22.140
They just
don't matter anymore.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.414
[knocks on door]

17:42.061 --> 17:43.127
Jack.

17:43.129 --> 17:44.562
I need to talk to you.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.565
Please come in.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.136
Thank you.

17:59.211 --> 18:00.478
Where do I start?

18:03.615 --> 18:07.952
Life is too short for us
to hold onto petty grievances.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.654
[sighs in relief]

18:09.656 --> 18:11.622
I agree wholeheartedly.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.157
Good.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.529
[sighs]

18:18.531 --> 18:20.565
[chuckles]

18:31.477 --> 18:32.577
I want you to know

18:32.579 --> 18:38.116
That if you ever
need anything...

18:38.118 --> 18:39.584
Even if you have

18:39.586 --> 18:43.287
The smallest care
in the world...

18:43.289 --> 18:44.489
You can count on me.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.260
Knock on my door day or night.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.630
Thank you.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.333
You're welcome.

19:00.506 --> 19:02.039
And if you give me
a second chance,

19:02.041 --> 19:03.040
I can do better than

19:03.042 --> 19:04.542
Chili and corn bread
at the saloon.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.261
Brilliant.

19:57.263 --> 19:59.096
Simply brilliant.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.198
I think I need to sit down.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.365
Did you hear
what miss thatcher said, ma?

20:01.367 --> 20:03.167
She said I'm smart!

20:03.169 --> 20:04.602
The first step
in helping bo

20:04.604 --> 20:06.270
Was to give him
an intelligence test.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.271
He scored

20:07.273 --> 20:09.540
Extremely high.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.042
I can't wait for pa
to get home so I can tell him.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.044
But I'm confused.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.046
How could he take a test
if he can't read?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.147
I read bo
the questions,

20:16.149 --> 20:18.683
And he remembered all of them.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.052
I think bo has a condition
called "word blindness."

20:21.054 --> 20:22.453
A fancy name for it
is "dyslexia."

20:22.455 --> 20:24.121
I've never heard of
such a thing.

20:24.123 --> 20:25.590
The research
is very new,

20:25.592 --> 20:28.059
But I think with the right
tools and methods,

20:28.061 --> 20:29.694
Bo will be able to
learn to read.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.829
I knew it.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.564
That old bat
of a teacher

20:33.566 --> 20:34.632
We had before you,

20:34.634 --> 20:36.234
She kept calling him
too slow to learn,

20:36.236 --> 20:37.668
But I knew
that couldn't be right.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.403
I have a hunch
it's all about to change.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.438
And bo,

20:40.440 --> 20:42.306
With the techniques
I've been studying,

20:42.308 --> 20:44.475
I think you can be
anything you wish.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.744
A doctor, or a scientist...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.279
Or a teacher, miss thatcher.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.182
Oh... I'm flattered.

20:51.184 --> 20:54.752
So, when do we start?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.864
Oh, my goodness,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.332
Abigail,

21:08.334 --> 21:10.434
Where have you been
all day?

21:10.436 --> 21:11.435
[sighs wearily]

21:11.437 --> 21:13.671
Working on a project.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.873
I'm sorry, I just realized
there's no dinner.

21:15.875 --> 21:19.277
I'm fine.
I just warmed up some leftovers.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.312
So...

21:21.314 --> 21:22.880
What is this project?

21:22.882 --> 21:26.117
Well, I'm not ready to say
just yet,

21:26.119 --> 21:27.818
But when I am, you will be
the first one to know.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.626
[sighs fondly]

21:42.301 --> 21:45.703
Peter was taller than me
by the time he was 13.

21:47.806 --> 21:52.543
This house
has so many memories.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.212
Abigail...

21:55.214 --> 21:57.448
What is it?

22:01.753 --> 22:04.522
I'm no longer a wife,

22:04.524 --> 22:08.492
I'm no longer a mother.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.930
I'm just struggling
to find my purpose now.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.171
Before I came here,

22:20.173 --> 22:21.839
I thought my purpose was

22:21.841 --> 22:23.441
Teaching at one of those
big-city schools.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.911
God shut that door,

22:26.913 --> 22:31.816
And he opened up another one,
a much more meaningful one,

22:31.818 --> 22:36.721
And that is teaching
here in coal valley.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.190
And I just know

22:39.192 --> 22:40.191
God will show you

22:40.193 --> 22:45.196
What he wants for you,
too, abigail.

22:45.198 --> 22:48.299
Thank you, elizabeth.

22:48.301 --> 22:51.402
That's good advice.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.604
Well, I'm bushed.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.239
I'm going to hit the hay.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.474
Good night.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.808
Good night.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.383
[clapping
while reciting together]

23:05.385 --> 23:07.918
"the... Cat... Ran... Fast."

23:07.920 --> 23:10.388
"the cat... Ran fast."

23:10.390 --> 23:11.422
Very good.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.627
Clap along
to this sentence.

23:16.629 --> 23:20.464
[bo's], clapping and reciting]:
"the... Cat... Ran... Fast?"

23:20.466 --> 23:22.833
They switched
the words around that time.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.868
It's all right.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.536
"the... Fast... Cat... Ran."

23:25.538 --> 23:26.937
Do you see?

23:26.939 --> 23:28.739
"the fast... Cat ran."

23:28.741 --> 23:29.974
It's just a little
a different that time.

23:31.309 --> 23:32.576
It's all right,
it's all right.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.446
Let's move on
to this sentence instead.

23:35.448 --> 23:39.383
"jane... Saw...
The... Big... House."

23:39.385 --> 23:40.684
Let's sing it together,
shall we?

23:40.686 --> 23:42.720
[bo's]: But I already
tried singing--

23:42.722 --> 23:44.355
What are you doing,
miss thatcher?

23:44.357 --> 23:45.890
What's this about?

23:45.892 --> 23:48.659
We were just working on
some reading exercises.

23:48.661 --> 23:49.794
What exercises?

23:49.796 --> 23:50.828
All I heard you
talking about

23:50.830 --> 23:51.996
Was some test.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.531
Carl, don't scold them.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.366
I gave miss thatcher
permission

23:55.368 --> 23:56.767
To start
working with bo.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.569
Why didn't you
tell me?

23:58.571 --> 23:59.770
Because I didn't
want you to nix it

23:59.772 --> 24:01.305
Before it even had a chance
to help, that's why.

24:01.307 --> 24:04.708
He needs this.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.045
Bo, would you go
upstairs, please?

24:09.014 --> 24:10.981
I need to have a word
with miss thatcher.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.957
Mr. Grady,

24:19.959 --> 24:23.294
These techniques are going to
help bo learn to read,

24:23.296 --> 24:24.495
I'm just sure of it.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.765
Look, I don't mean to be
ungrateful, miss thatcher,

24:27.767 --> 24:30.034
But I did hear
what was going on in here,

24:30.036 --> 24:32.002
And your fancy techniques

24:32.004 --> 24:33.304
Didn't make
an ounce of difference.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.839
Bo just memorized
what you wanted him to say.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.440
And then he recited it
back to you

24:36.442 --> 24:37.374
Like he's always done.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.009
Until you changed it up
on him,

24:39.011 --> 24:40.377
And then he couldn't do it.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.579
It might take some more time,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.447
But the research says
that with repetition--

24:43.449 --> 24:44.548
I'm sorry,

24:44.550 --> 24:45.716
But I'm not going to
let you get his hopes up

24:45.718 --> 24:46.984
Over somethin'
that's never gonna happen.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.085
Mr. Grady,

24:48.087 --> 24:51.822
Why are you so afraid of
letting bo try this?

24:53.091 --> 24:56.460
Because I love my boy,

24:56.462 --> 24:58.062
And I know how cruel
this world can be,

24:58.064 --> 25:00.064
And I don't aim to see him
crushed by it.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.968
As long as you're not the one
doing the crushing.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.411
His birthday is in a week.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.813
If you have him reading by then,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.983
I'll let him stay
and continue his schooling.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.484
If not,

25:20.486 --> 25:22.620
He's coming to work
in the mine with me.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.121
A week is not enough time.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.589
We have to find
the right combination.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.525
It's like picking a lock.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.093
I'm sorry,

25:29.095 --> 25:32.830
But it's going to be a week.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.452
All right, emily,

25:55.454 --> 25:57.821
It's your turn
to read aloud now.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.959
"the cat ran fast.
The fast cat ran.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.694
"run, run, run

26:03.696 --> 26:05.596
"after the bat,
fast cat.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.764
Run fast!"

26:06.766 --> 26:07.898
This is too easy,
miss thatcher.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.101
May I please
go onto the next level?

26:15.640 --> 26:18.576
Yes, emily,
you may go on.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.078
"now, fanny, toss it
to the top of the wall

26:21.080 --> 26:23.581
If you can."

26:23.583 --> 26:24.982
Very nice.

26:43.835 --> 26:44.868
Elizabeth?

26:44.870 --> 26:46.070
I'm sorry.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.104
I know it's late.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.005
What's wrong?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.039
It's abigail.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.841
She's been coming home
late at night.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.042
She says she's working
on something,

26:52.044 --> 26:53.944
But she seems
really depressed.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.779
She never came home tonight,
and I'm...

26:55.781 --> 26:56.847
I'm worried about her.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.016
I think I know where she is.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.117
You do?

27:00.119 --> 27:01.118
Yeah.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.687
Come on.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.990
I'll take you to her.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.837
I have a feeling

27:19.839 --> 27:20.871
This conversation
is better

27:20.873 --> 27:23.307
Between just
the two of you.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.081
[whispering]
abigail?

27:33.718 --> 27:34.885
What are you doing here?

27:34.887 --> 27:37.688
Elizabeth.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.024
How did you know
where to find me?

27:40.026 --> 27:41.125
Jack brought me.

27:41.127 --> 27:44.695
He says you've been here
every night this week.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.865
What's going on?

27:48.867 --> 27:50.668
Well, actually,
this is all your fault.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.136
[laughs]

27:52.138 --> 27:53.537
The other day,

27:53.539 --> 27:54.872
When you were
enjoying my scones,

27:54.874 --> 27:57.207
And you said all those
fancy chefs at home

27:57.209 --> 27:58.575
Had never concocted

27:58.577 --> 27:59.576
Anything finer,

27:59.578 --> 28:00.744
I got to thinking.

28:00.746 --> 28:03.280
"what if I could
reopen the cafe?"

28:03.282 --> 28:05.215
It would be
a great new start for me.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.518
Oh, abigail,
that's a wonderful idea.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.621
I met with gowen
to try to make a deal,

28:10.623 --> 28:12.690
But I should have known
he would make things hard.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.559
He said he would allow me
to open the cafe,

28:15.561 --> 28:16.894
But I had to give him my home.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.029
Your home?

28:19.031 --> 28:20.831
I have a week to decide.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.266
[gasps]

28:22.268 --> 28:24.068
It's a steep
price to pay,

28:24.070 --> 28:26.704
And my first inclination
was to say no,

28:26.706 --> 28:28.105
But then I realized,

28:28.107 --> 28:30.708
Noah and peter don't live
in that house anymore.

28:32.610 --> 28:34.878
They're with me wherever I go,

28:34.880 --> 28:37.047
And I need to find
a new purpose in life.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.250
I need to find a new reason
to get up in the morning.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.752
I understand,

28:41.754 --> 28:45.355
And I know you would be
a huge success.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.293
But why keep it a secret?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.929
Nobody in town has ever tried
anything like this before.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.964
I didn't want you
to think I was crazy.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.066
I would never
think that.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.768
Well, maybe you should.

28:57.770 --> 28:58.869
[chuckling]

28:58.871 --> 29:00.337
Gowen is betting
against me

29:00.339 --> 29:01.805
And maybe he's right.

29:03.108 --> 29:04.208
I don't know,
elizabeth,

29:04.210 --> 29:07.277
Maybe it's...
It's too risky,

29:07.279 --> 29:10.647
To lose my house
for a foolish dream.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.851
Abigail...

29:13.853 --> 29:16.754
I would never
tell you what to do,

29:16.756 --> 29:18.288
But you are one of
the most remarkable women

29:18.290 --> 29:19.690
I have ever met.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.927
You didn't think you could help
carla deliver those twins,

29:23.929 --> 29:25.295
But all three of them
wouldn't be alive

29:25.297 --> 29:26.597
If it weren't for you.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.599
And none
of those widows

29:28.601 --> 29:29.633
Would have their homes

29:29.635 --> 29:32.336
If you hadn't led them
into the mine.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.737
I believe in you.

29:35.006 --> 29:36.206
And I believe

29:36.208 --> 29:39.643
You can accomplish anything
you set your mind to.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.912
Thank you.

29:41.914 --> 29:42.980
That means a lot.

29:46.851 --> 29:49.953
I was going to bake
some cookies for the kids,

29:49.955 --> 29:54.258
But then I fell asleep,
and the dough went bad.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.926
They're adorable.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.895
[giggling] these shapes...

30:03.034 --> 30:05.903
Do you have
any more of this dough?

30:17.882 --> 30:19.049
Bo...

30:22.821 --> 30:25.189
I'll catch up, pa.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.027
You're going into the mine?

30:30.029 --> 30:32.696
Yes, miss thatcher.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.798
But I just...

30:34.800 --> 30:37.201
I just found something.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.336
The research says
that people with word blindness

30:39.338 --> 30:40.971
Think in
three dimensions.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.306
That's why you're so good at
building your models,

30:42.308 --> 30:44.174
Because they make sense to you.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.275
Miss thatcher,

30:45.277 --> 30:47.344
I don't even understand
what you're saying.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.812
Let me explain!

30:48.814 --> 30:51.148
The reason you can't remember
the words and the letters

30:51.150 --> 30:53.917
Is because they're squiggles
and shapes on the page.

30:55.753 --> 30:56.753
But look...

30:56.755 --> 30:58.455
This is a "c."

30:58.457 --> 31:00.023
I made it into a cat.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.459
Now, the sound for "c"
is "kuh, kuh--"

31:02.461 --> 31:04.294
I already made my decision.

31:05.230 --> 31:06.363
Oh, please, bo!

31:06.365 --> 31:08.398
You still have a week
until your birthday.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.734
This is best.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.238
Thank you for
trying to help me,

31:14.240 --> 31:16.340
But this is best.

31:39.364 --> 31:40.464
[sighs nervously]

31:47.005 --> 31:48.238
I have to say,

31:48.240 --> 31:49.373
I'm surprised

31:49.375 --> 31:50.474
You're going through
with this, mrs. Stanton.

31:51.509 --> 31:53.243
Trust me,
that makes two of us.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.344
All that's left

31:54.346 --> 31:56.380
Is for you sign
at the bottom of the page,

31:56.382 --> 31:57.547
And the cafe is yours to run.

32:10.895 --> 32:12.296
Congratulations.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.031
Thank you.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.236
You widows
put me through hell

32:19.238 --> 32:20.437
Over those row houses.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.240
I'm glad to finally
get one back.

32:24.976 --> 32:26.243
Just for the record,

32:26.245 --> 32:29.012
This town will never
support a cafe.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.315
How do you know?

32:31.317 --> 32:34.885
Well, I don't know much,
but I know business,

32:34.887 --> 32:38.021
And if coal valley were ready
for another eatery,

32:38.023 --> 32:39.890
I would have opened it myself.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.873
[rain pouring]

33:03.381 --> 33:08.218
And some lovely curtains
will spruce this place right up.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.555
[rain dripping]

33:24.836 --> 33:26.903
[rain dripping]

33:32.176 --> 33:37.180
Okay, well, they say
a little rain is good luck.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.586
[rain dripping]

33:46.124 --> 33:48.392
[sighs heavily]

34:40.912 --> 34:42.379
[quietly] he did it.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.549
[chuckles in delight]

34:54.692 --> 34:56.026
[knocking]

34:56.028 --> 34:57.994
I smelled cookies,
mrs. Stanton.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.296
Are you selling them?

34:59.298 --> 35:02.332
Well, miles, I'm not officially
open yet, but, um...

35:02.334 --> 35:03.366
Let me see what I can do.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.675
Here you go,
these are on the house.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.276
Gee, thanks!

35:13.278 --> 35:14.511
Hey, miles,

35:14.513 --> 35:17.147
I guess that makes you
my first official customer.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.616
I sure hope you have more.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.951
Why?

35:20.953 --> 35:22.786
Because
you're gonna need them.

35:51.983 --> 35:52.983
Carl...

35:52.985 --> 35:54.484
Please try to keep
an open mind

35:54.486 --> 35:55.986
And just listen to what
miss thatcher has to say--

35:55.988 --> 35:57.988
Already heard
everything there is to hear.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.624
Bo...

36:01.692 --> 36:03.260
Would you please
read to us?

36:03.262 --> 36:04.327
That's it.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.795
Bo, you don't have to.

36:15.406 --> 36:16.373
"the...

36:16.375 --> 36:17.607
"cat...

36:17.609 --> 36:19.242
Ran... Fast."

36:20.344 --> 36:23.647
"the... Fast... Cat... Ran."

36:25.183 --> 36:27.117
"run, run, run...

36:27.119 --> 36:28.652
"aft...

36:28.654 --> 36:30.587
"aft...

36:30.589 --> 36:31.655
Aft..."

36:31.657 --> 36:33.390
[gently] after...

36:34.792 --> 36:37.761
"after... The... Bat...

36:37.763 --> 36:39.763
"fast cat.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.797
Run fast."

36:40.799 --> 36:41.865
Dear lord.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.235
How?

37:12.830 --> 37:14.364
I can see 'em now, pa.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.600
They finally make sense.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.468
What's this called?

37:18.470 --> 37:21.504
"s." "s" for snake.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.707
"s."

37:23.709 --> 37:24.841
And this.

37:24.843 --> 37:28.712
What's this say?

37:28.714 --> 37:29.813
"cat."

37:30.715 --> 37:32.515
"c," "a," "t."

37:32.517 --> 37:34.718
It says "cat".

37:34.720 --> 37:38.588
Cat...

37:50.401 --> 37:52.302
Gabe!

37:52.304 --> 37:53.336
[laughing]
what's going on?

37:53.338 --> 37:55.572
They're selling cookies
at the old cafe.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.507
Better hurry
before they're gone.

38:03.547 --> 38:05.815
You enjoy that pie.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.150
Thank you...

38:07.152 --> 38:08.818
Oh, my goodness,
abigail.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.287
What is all this?

38:10.289 --> 38:12.555
After I signed the house
over to gowen--

38:12.557 --> 38:14.157
Oh, yes--

38:14.159 --> 38:15.358
I lit the stove.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.893
I guess the smell
of fresh baked goods

38:16.895 --> 38:18.261
Drew all these people.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.729
They've been at my door
since early this morning.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.564
I am so proud of you.

38:21.566 --> 38:23.433
You did it.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.201
Not without
your encouragement.

38:25.203 --> 38:26.770
Excuse me, ma'am.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.606
The line starts back there.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.174
Very funny.

38:31.176 --> 38:32.275
This is amazing, isn't it?

38:32.277 --> 38:34.277
It is.

38:34.279 --> 38:35.578
I guess it proves

38:35.580 --> 38:36.680
If you want something
bad enough,

38:36.682 --> 38:37.681
You find a way to get it.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.749
I guess you're right.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.284
Hello,
miss thatcher.

38:41.286 --> 38:42.786
Mountie jack!

38:42.788 --> 38:43.787
Jolene,

38:43.789 --> 38:45.322
How are those
baby birds doing?

38:45.324 --> 38:46.289
I named one after you

38:46.291 --> 38:47.290
Because his red feathers

38:47.292 --> 38:48.525
Are like your coat.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.293
[chuckles] I'm honored.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.761
Come along, jolene.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.430
You won't have to
fix anything anymore.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.899
My daddy comes home tomorrow.

39:00.204 --> 39:01.204
Only miner
pulled out alive

39:01.206 --> 39:02.272
After the disaster

39:02.274 --> 39:04.407
Is coming home
from the hospital tomorrow,

39:04.409 --> 39:06.576
A new business
is thriving.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.578
This town
is growing fast.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.780
Soon, it will be a big city
just like cape fullerton,

39:10.782 --> 39:13.283
And you won't have
any reason to leave.

39:13.285 --> 39:14.684
True.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.221
But there is another reason
for me to stay.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.390
Is there?

39:20.392 --> 39:21.558
Yes.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.625
I think it's only fair

39:22.627 --> 39:25.895
That you take the same test
you gave me.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.464
Starting with
a basic task

39:27.466 --> 39:29.232
To test your ability
to follow instructions.

39:29.234 --> 39:30.233
[laughs]

39:30.235 --> 39:31.434
Oh, really?

39:31.436 --> 39:34.304
Yeah, it's an important
part of the test.

39:34.306 --> 39:37.540
All right.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.342
Good.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.211
Do you agree
to forgive me

39:41.213 --> 39:43.980
For everything stupid
I've ever said or done?

39:43.982 --> 39:45.415
[laughs]

39:45.417 --> 39:46.516
I don't know.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.418
There are just
so many of them.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.721
Well, no one said it was
gonna be an easy test.

39:53.290 --> 39:55.425
I can follow
those instructions.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.594
I'm glad.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.596
Is that the end
of the test?

39:59.598 --> 40:01.297
[chuckles] oh, no.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.500
Now comes
the written part.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.302
[sighs]

40:15.713 --> 40:17.747
Mm-hmm.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.951
Well, there's
another one

40:21.953 --> 40:23.653
You got wrong.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.555
Are you sure you're
scoring it correctly?

40:25.557 --> 40:28.725
Relax, I graduated
with honors.

40:30.461 --> 40:31.561
Jack, do you stay up at night

40:31.563 --> 40:32.495
Just thinking of ways
to drive me batty?

40:32.497 --> 40:33.696
Nope, don't have to.

40:33.698 --> 40:35.432
Just sort of
comes out naturally.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.000
[sighs]

40:42.339 --> 40:44.541
Okay...

40:46.577 --> 40:47.777
Well, are you
going to tell me or not?

40:47.779 --> 40:49.279
Are you sure you want to know?

40:49.281 --> 40:50.547
Of course I want to know.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.982
See, it turns out,

40:52.984 --> 40:54.784
You're not quite as smart
as I thought you were.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.053
That's not true.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.557
Jack, is this payback
for the test I gave you?

41:00.559 --> 41:01.558
No.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.060
No, you really
didn't do very well.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.595
Let me see.

41:06.964 --> 41:07.964
Jack...

41:07.966 --> 41:09.466
Let me see it.

41:09.468 --> 41:10.633
[giggling]
let me see it!

41:10.635 --> 41:11.601
Give it to me,
please.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.403
Okay, just relax.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.373
[clears throat]

41:34.892 --> 41:38.761
[♪]
