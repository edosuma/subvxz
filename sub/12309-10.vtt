WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:03.710
Previously on Stargate Atlantis.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.950
So I understand you have a proposal.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.999
We've come up with a gene therapy
that alters Wraith DNA.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.115
And we think we can make it

00:11.200 --> 00:14.556
so that you will never need
to feed on humans again.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.437
Here. Try this.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.038
McKAY: His name was Janus.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.709
Causality is not to be treated so lightly.

00:21.800 --> 00:22.994
No one's treating it lightly.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.033
You are. And you are insistent
on continuing these experiments.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.914
We order you to cease these activities.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.354
McKAY: I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.351
If we do this every time
someone comes for a visit,

00:36.440 --> 00:37.429
we'll never get any work done.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.034
- We're just meeting him at the gate.
- We're not just meeting him at the gate.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.159
I've been pulled from my regular duties
to help him with his database research.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.355
I've got stuff on the go, you know,

00:45.440 --> 00:49.274
important, vital projects
for the betterment of the human race.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.557
Apparently, there are other people
doing equally important work, Rodney,

00:52.640 --> 00:54.119
as hard as that is to believe.

00:55.960 --> 00:56.949
An exciting day!

00:57.040 --> 00:59.156
Absolutely.
McKAY: Yeah.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.400
- He's ready to beam.
- Very well.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.950
Dr. Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.792
Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.
It's great to be back.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.235
Colonel Sheppard, Rodney.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.880 --> 02:24.472
I'll have Rodney here
show you to your quarters.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.279
Actually, I'd like to get started right away,
if that's okay with you, Rodney?

02:27.360 --> 02:28.395
Sure, sure. What have you got planned?

02:28.480 --> 02:31.074
An exciting exploration
of insignificant Ancient historical events?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.594
No, not quite. I'm sure you're both familiar
with the Ancient named Janus.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.079
- The inventor?
- Yes, he was their lead scientist,

02:35.160 --> 02:36.229
and apparently a bit of a renegade.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.676
Yeah, and I've been over all of his logs.
Look, this is work we've done already.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.479
Well, I'm pretty sure I have information
that could lead us to his secret lab.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.913
Secret lab?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.911
Yes, a place where he conducted
and subsequently hid

02:46.000 --> 02:48.275
a significant portion
of his unauthorized research.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.830
And if I'm correct,
it's right here on Atlantis.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.149
I've been over Janus's database entries
with a fine-tooth comb.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.798
I never saw any mention of a secret lab.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.677
Janus was doing a lot of work
that wasn't exactly approved

03:02.760 --> 03:04.716
by the Ancient council,
so it's not hard to imagine

03:04.800 --> 03:08.110
he wouldn't include a full accounting
in this very public database.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.668
I mean, do you include all of your research
in your official reports?

03:10.760 --> 03:11.954
Just get to the point.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.359
Okay. He never talked about it
in his entries,

03:13.440 --> 03:14.873
but several of Janus's peers suspected

03:14.960 --> 03:18.077
he had a bastion of unfettered thought
and experimentation.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.390
- Or as one of his lovers put it...
- He had lovers?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.357
..."An isle of solitude
within the city walls. "

03:22.440 --> 03:23.589
Well, that could just mean
he's hard to talk to.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.079
People say things like that
about me all the time.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.878
None of these writers had any idea
where the lab could be,

03:26.960 --> 03:28.473
but one of his young assistants
recalls a day

03:28.560 --> 03:30.516
where Janus turned
a corner down a hallway.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.909
"Today I saw Janus in the hallway. "
There's a real page-turner.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.228
He chased after him
with a question about his work,

03:34.320 --> 03:36.470
but when he rounded the corner,
Janus was gone.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.232
The hallway was a dead end.
He had seemingly disappeared,

03:38.320 --> 03:40.436
and, I think, into his secret lab.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.439
Well, did this assistant
happen to mention...

03:42.520 --> 03:44.590
Which hallway? Yes. He does.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.755
Yeah.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.829
Hmm.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.115
As soon as the Daedalus
unloads its supplies,

03:53.200 --> 03:55.509
we'll be heading off to meet up
with Todd and one of his hives.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.999
You really think
he's going to show up, huh?

03:57.080 --> 03:59.753
And let you guys try out Dr. Keller's
gene therapy on a few of his guys?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.229
Well, we held up our end of the deal.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.596
We let him use Teyla to take control
of an alliance of Wraith hives.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.159
That's what I'm saying.
He's got what he wants.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.231
I should go with you,
because I have a relationship with Todd.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.153
That is precisely
why I don't want you there.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.753
This mission is basically
going to be a negotiation,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.273
and Todd has...

04:17.360 --> 04:20.158
Well, less baggage with me
than he does with you.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.356
I'm not saying you shouldn't
take the lead on this. I'm just...

04:22.440 --> 04:25.034
You're second in command here, Colonel.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.991
I know my predecessors
played fast and loose

04:28.080 --> 04:29.957
with many of the rules set forth
by the IOA,

04:30.040 --> 04:32.270
but protocol plainly states
that in the rare instance

04:32.360 --> 04:35.272
where I am required to leave Atlantis,
you stay put.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.557
You're in command here
until I get back. Understood?

04:39.200 --> 04:40.679
Okay.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.354
- Try not to blow her up while I'm gone.
- No promises.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.233
Yeah, I think this should be the last of it.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.673
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.438
- I was just leaving.
- Yeah, I know.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.397
- Here, let me get that.
- Thanks.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.711
- So you're going on this Daedalus thing?
- Yeah.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.479
Thank you.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.713
I kind of have to. I'm the one that's
going to be administering the treatment.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.190
- If, you know, we ever get to that point.
- Right.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.191
- I think I should come with you on this.
- Really? Why?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.951
I don't really trust these guys.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.678
You don't trust Todd and his Wraith,

05:15.760 --> 05:19.992
or the entire crew of the Daedalus
to protect me if something goes wrong?

05:20.840 --> 05:22.910
I don't know. Both, I guess.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.193
- What?
- Nothing.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.599
- What?
- Nothing! Nothing.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.035
- It'd be great to have the company.
- Okay.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.634
- Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.911
What do you mean, "us"?

05:39.080 --> 05:40.798
Rod? You...

05:46.880 --> 05:47.915
Is that a water line up there?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.468
McKAY: Yeah, this section of the city
flooded the first year we were here.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.437
Anything salvageable
got moved to the main tower.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.112
Well, that's remote.
That's promising.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.714
He wouldn't want anyone around
when he came in and out of his lab.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.189
- Like the Batcave!
- Yes, just like the Batcave.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.874
I'm not picking up anything unusual.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.269
Something used to be attached here.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.353
- And here.
- And another one.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.989
Any idea what they are?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.877
Looks like a run-of-the-mill
sconce interface.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.713
Right. Well, where are the sconces?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.951
I don't know.
Maybe the decorator changed his mind.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.632
You said after the flood,
anything worth salvaging

06:23.720 --> 06:24.709
was moved to the main tower.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.473
Now, please tell me you kept detailed
records of what was found and where.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.949
Did we keep detailed records?
Who are you talking to here?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.872
There. That's the hallway.
Can you zoom in there?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.031
There. There are your light fixtures.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.394
Must have been knocked loose
during the flood.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.754
- Possibly.
- But you salvaged them, right?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.558
They're lights that fell
to the ground during a flood...

06:54.640 --> 06:57.712
Just humor me, okay?
I think we're on to something.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.152
All right.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.118
McKAY: Here they are.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.719
I've got them.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.079
That's odd.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.113
Each of these three lights
made a different tone

07:34.200 --> 07:36.794
when I plugged them in.
Does that usually happen around here?

07:36.880 --> 07:38.393
Not usually, no.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.440
Well, they've been banged around a lot,
underwater for a few days.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.112
Maybe they're just broken.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.189
No, it's a puzzle.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.510
I think we need to activate these
in a specific order.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.589
You mean like a three-digit code?

07:53.680 --> 07:54.669
You know how easy
that would be to break?

07:54.760 --> 07:56.751
- There's only six variations.
- Well, maybe we need to activate them

07:56.840 --> 07:58.159
a number of times in a specific order.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.958
I don't suppose you recognize
any of these three notes?

08:00.040 --> 08:02.759
What, you mean, like, does it remind me
of Janus's favorite Brian Eno track?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.398
No. No such luck.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.789
Janus's assistant said he disappeared
pretty quickly down the hallway,

08:06.880 --> 08:08.677
so it can't be a long code.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.910
Maybe it's just as simple
as three tones in a row.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.914
Go for it.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.673
- McKAY: Hold on for a second.
- What is it?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.432
- Come here and push against this wall.
- Why?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.671
Please. Just humor me.
I think I'm on to something.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.837
Okay, on the count of three,

08:46.920 --> 08:49.070
I want you to push against the wall
as hard as you can, okay?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.195
Okay.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.876
Okay. One, two, three.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.039
Son of a bitch.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.873
McKAY: Controlled magnetic
harmonic resonance.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.029
What?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.394
Apparently, Tesla was close
to something like this

09:15.480 --> 09:17.630
before Edison trashed his lab.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.394
- What are you talking about?
- That wall was specially designed

09:20.480 --> 09:23.119
to de-stabilize when bombarded
with a very specific harmonic resonance.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.349
That's what the tones were.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.510
And the strong magnetic property
of the particles

09:26.600 --> 09:28.352
is what keeps the door
from just crumbling into dust.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.475
It's a great way to hide a door,

09:29.560 --> 09:32.438
because, you know,
if you're looking for a door to open,

09:32.520 --> 09:35.796
it's never going to be found.
It's like a hologram, only better,

09:35.880 --> 09:37.836
because it's solid mass
until the tones are playing.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.434
Right, so you could have just told me
to walk through the door when you did.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.636
- I could have, yes.
- Yes, yes.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.797
Where the hell are we?

10:03.760 --> 10:05.034
Wow.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.712
Janus's secret lab.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.757
Alert the others.
The device has been activated.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.713
- Hey, Mr. Woolsey.
- Dr. Keller.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.236
Where is your burly protector?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.197
It's odd to see you
without him nowadays.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.793
He's in the lab.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.271
What are you working on?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.078
- A speech.
- What for?

11:17.320 --> 11:19.914
Well, this is a fairly momentous occasion.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.954
The Wraith will take a step forward,
not only for their own benefit,

11:23.040 --> 11:25.349
but for that of the entire galaxy.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.271
It's a historic day.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.079
I just think it deserves some recognition.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.751
What have you got so far?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.551
"Today is an historic day. "

11:38.480 --> 11:40.471
It's a good place to start.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.190
Well, it's a work in progress.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.389
- That's pretty cool.
- Harmonic resonance.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.438
Yeah, I was told.
But what happens if the sound goes off

11:59.520 --> 12:01.033
and you're in the middle of the wall?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.473
Well, the wall would
break apart your body.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.549
Maybe we should...

12:03.640 --> 12:05.676
I've set up a subsonic
tone generator outside.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.069
The wall is now permanently open.
Don't worry.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.799
Good. So what have we got?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.552
Well, the good news is
it's definitely Janus's secret lab.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.437
The bad news is,
getting in was the easy part.

12:14.520 --> 12:16.875
There are levels of encryption
on all the data here

12:16.960 --> 12:19.394
that even the most
paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.629
I mean, it is deep.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.835
Some of them
are straight-up math ciphers,

12:21.920 --> 12:23.797
while others
are Ancient knowledge puzzles.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.108
And until we start deciphering,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.191
there's no way to tell
what any of this stuff does.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.158
Sounds like you guys
make a good team, though.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.115
Yeah.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.156
Well, I guess I'll go back to being the boss.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.310
- McKAY: How's that going?
- Pretty boring, actually.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.198
Well, you're more than welcome
to help us crack this first stream cipher.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.794
You know, he could have been in Mensa.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.073
Why don't you contact me when
you two geniuses have a breakthrough?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.309
Will do.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.199
- Sir, we're being hailed.
- Open a channel.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.032
This is Colonel Caldwell
of the Earth ship Daedalus.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.270
We're ready to receive your delegation.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.999
The delegation
is on their way.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.316
Marks, you have the bridge.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.550
I'm going to go meet our guests.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.752
Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having us.

13:58.880 --> 14:03.351
Today is an historic day.
Robert Grosseteste once said...

14:03.440 --> 14:05.749
I would like to get started
as soon as possible.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.869
Yes, of course. But I wanted to recognize...

14:09.960 --> 14:13.032
I have my doubts
that your plan will be effective.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.719
So shall we drop these unfounded
pleasantries and get to work?

14:20.840 --> 14:22.114
Very well.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.956
Dr. Keller, lead the way.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.798
Please come with me.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.550
- Robert who?
- Never mind.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.593
You know, it's almost dawn.
If you want to call it a night, it's...

15:01.680 --> 15:03.079
What? No, no, no, I'm fine, fine.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.391
But, you know, if you need to rest,
completely understand.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.518
Seriously, is everything
a competition with you?

15:10.600 --> 15:12.830
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.480
I just found you a secret lab
full of really cool Ancient stuff.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.312
I kind of think that should score me
some points here.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.914
Okay, I will admit that I may have been
a little brusque with you up until now.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.035
- Just a little.
- But the truth is,

15:21.840 --> 15:24.434
I really didn't think
you were going to find anything.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.556
Well, that much I actually understand.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.994
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.829
I've spent the majority
of my professional life

15:32.920 --> 15:34.273
being ridiculed for my theories,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.272
most of which turned out
to be correct, by the way.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.112
I'm kind of used to it, Rodney.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.792
Doesn't that bother you?

15:42.880 --> 15:46.031
I mean, no vindication,
no recognition, no credit?

15:46.760 --> 15:49.149
Well, I could say
the same thing about you.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.879
The discoveries you've made,
you probably could've won the Nobel Prize

15:51.960 --> 15:53.791
five times over by now.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.274
It's too true.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.068
So, I guess none of us signed up
to get famous, huh?

15:59.160 --> 16:00.752
No, we did it for the money.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.072
Good one.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.519
Wait a minute.
You don't get paid more than I do, do you?

16:10.440 --> 16:11.589
Do you?

16:22.200 --> 16:25.829
- Hyperspace window just opened.
- Daedalus isn't due back yet.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.719
Get Sheppard.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.235
Colonel Sheppard, sir?
- Yeah, just resting my eyes.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.709
Who said that?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.392
I patched into the PA
in your room, sir.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.155
You're going to want to get up here.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.108
What's going on?

17:02.200 --> 17:05.317
We're tracking a small ship,
in atmosphere. It's coming right for us.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.799
Get the Jumpers in the air.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.429
It's closing fast, sir.
It'll be here in less than 10 seconds.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.272
Shields up. I still want the Jumpers ready.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.593
Here it comes.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.874
- That's impossible.
- What did it just do?

17:30.960 --> 17:33.918
It passed through the shield.
- Yeah, but how did it do that?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.592
I'm not sure, sir.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.637
Ancient ships can do it.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.399
All right, tell Teyla and a team of Marines
to meet me at that pier.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.952
They should be right in front of you.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.398
Don't move!

18:45.640 --> 18:47.392
What's at the bottom of this tower?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.315
Rodney.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.432
Rodney, this is Sheppard. Come in.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.319
Rodney!
- What's up?

19:01.160 --> 19:04.277
- You need to get out of there right now.
- Why?

20:08.960 --> 20:11.758
Control Room,
what's the status of that ship?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.912
I'm sorry, Colonel. They're gone.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.711
- Is it alive?
- You tell me.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.039
No. I'm not getting any coherent readings.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.997
Perhaps we should put it
under a medical scanner.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.230
- Okay, do it.
- Go get a gurney.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.318
So is it true
they took Rodney and Dr. Jackson?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.475
Yeah.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.236
McKAY: What the hell happened?
We were attacked.

20:58.320 --> 21:02.711
- That much I got, thanks. By who?
- I was kind of hoping you could tell me.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.109
Okay, there is no way
this is a coincidence.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.317
We discover Janus's super-secret lab,
and less than 24 hours later,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.391
a bunch of aliens show up,
all guns blazing?

21:10.480 --> 21:14.598
- Don't you think that's a little odd?
- Now that you mention it...

21:19.600 --> 21:21.750
They knew exactly
what they were looking for.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.149
Didn't waste any time,
went straight for the lab.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.516
When they came out,
one of them was carrying a device.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.391
Unfortunately,
we haven't had nearly enough time

21:33.480 --> 21:34.754
to go through everything we found in here,

21:34.840 --> 21:37.638
so there's no way
of knowing exactly what they took.

21:38.680 --> 21:41.752
All this stuff came on when
Rodney and Dr. Jackson came in here.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.829
Pretty much.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.036
It activated probably in response
to Rodney's ATA gene. Why?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.870
What if something in here
has been broadcasting?

21:49.760 --> 21:51.478
A subspace signal.
It's the only possible answer.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.232
- What are you talking about?
- We've come across them before.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.311
They're a real-time,
practically instantaneous link

21:55.400 --> 21:56.389
between two Ancient devices.

21:56.480 --> 21:57.959
They can be separated
by, like, half a galaxy.

21:58.440 --> 22:01.477
There's a bunch of aliens out there.
They stumble upon an Ancient lab,

22:01.560 --> 22:03.278
probably built by Janus himself.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.952
It's dormant. It's not working.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.110
Then one day, out of the blue, it activates.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.633
So they're standing around,
scratching their heads.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.039
They have no idea what's going on.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.156
- Then they discover the subspace link.
- Decide to follow it,

22:12.240 --> 22:13.559
they trace it back to us.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.790
And then attack us
and take two of our people hostage?

22:15.880 --> 22:17.791
Rodney and Dr. Jackson
were not the targets.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.359
They were just at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

22:19.440 --> 22:22.193
Whatever that device was,
that's what they were after.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.077
All right, good theory. So what do we do?

22:25.160 --> 22:26.752
Well, we... We've got to get out of here.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.273
We're probably on a ship
traveling through hyperspace.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.759
- Where are we going to go?
- I'll think of something.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.478
- Really?
- Yep. Always do.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.955
Ow!

22:33.040 --> 22:34.519
Oh, yeah, I tried that.
They zap you when you touch them.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.431
You could have told me that
before I touched it!

22:36.520 --> 22:38.112
I could have, yes.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.111
Look, they stripped us of everything
but the clothing on our backs

22:41.200 --> 22:42.349
and surrounded us with laser walls.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.192
I'm not sure how much play we have here.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.635
- We've got one thing going for us, at least.
- What's that?

22:46.720 --> 22:48.392
We're not dead yet.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.235
Good point.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.111
It's no good.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.155
I'm still not getting any useful readings.

23:02.240 --> 23:07.075
The suit is emitting some sort of EM field
that's disrupting the scanner.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.593
I have no idea how to shut it off.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.830
There's no way to penetrate the shield
and see what's under there?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.114
I'm afraid not.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.236
Do you think there's a human
underneath all that armor?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.117
Impossible to say. Could be a robot.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.998
One thing's for sure, it's not like
anything we've ever seen before.

23:19.080 --> 23:22.152
Well, Dr. Weir did say that there were
other technologically advanced societies

23:22.240 --> 23:23.434
that we have yet to encounter.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.670
We just made first contact.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.356
What do you want me to do?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.193
Cut it open.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.190
It's no good. I just dulled out the blade.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.679
- The neck.
- What?

23:50.760 --> 23:53.035
Looks like the softest part. Try the neck.

23:53.200 --> 23:54.758
- But...
- It's already dead, Radek.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.757
- We think.
- Just do it.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.759
It's working!

24:14.640 --> 24:15.789
Uh-oh.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.789
Get out. Everyone, get out!

24:29.320 --> 24:30.833
Everyone okay?

24:30.920 --> 24:31.909
Yes.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.799
Somebody really wants to keep secret
whatever's inside that suit.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.911
We've run close to a hundred simulations

24:43.000 --> 24:47.073
based on full medical scans
of the Wraith we've had in captivity.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.954
- They've all been successful.
We both know very well

24:51.040 --> 24:54.715
that computer simulations
and live trials are very different.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.879
I don't think we're doing this cavalierly.
I stand by the data. It will work.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.118
Perhaps it will.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.594
The question is, do you want it to?

25:16.480 --> 25:18.277
I do see the benefits.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.874
Even if we only use the therapy
on some of my troops,

25:22.960 --> 25:27.033
say, those whose lives, thanks to this war,
are expected to be short.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.712
Why waste perfectly good resources
on them, yes?

25:32.840 --> 25:35.354
But it will be very difficult for me
to ask those around me

25:35.440 --> 25:38.750
to give themselves over
for the good of the human race.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.068
But it's for your benefit, too.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.192
If you don't have to rely on human feeding,
the war would be over.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.514
Perhaps.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.991
But then what would we do?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.913
Who would we be?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.628
Can we talk to somebody in charge?

26:32.720 --> 26:34.278
I think there's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.874
There's no need to treat us this way.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.831
Get the device operational.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.036
I don't even know what it is!

26:53.400 --> 26:55.277
Oh, great. It's sealed shut,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.191
and they've removed
the door controls from this side.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.077
Where the hell are we?

26:59.640 --> 27:02.279
I'd say, judging by the Lantian
architecture, I'd guess, you know,

27:02.360 --> 27:04.590
secret Janus facility,
which is, you know, probably bad for us,

27:04.680 --> 27:06.796
because it probably means
it's hard to find.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.395
So I guess that means
no rescue any time soon.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.479
That look familiar to you?

27:15.560 --> 27:17.357
Yeah, it's the device from the Atlantis lab.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.032
At least we know
why they brought us with them.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.350
Yeah, they need us to get
the device operational. I caught that.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.793
Right, and I don't think
we're gonna get any more info

27:22.880 --> 27:24.233
from Talky McSays-a-Lot out there,

27:24.320 --> 27:27.153
so fire up these consoles,
see what we're dealing with.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.673
Not like that.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.833
Let's see. Yeah, like that.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.793
And then I need to be right there.
Yep. Thanks. There.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.355
We've got five Jumpers in the air

27:38.440 --> 27:40.351
flying a defensive formation
around the city,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.908
and have the chair fired up
and ready for you at a moment's notice.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.558
I want Marine details every five levels,

27:44.640 --> 27:46.676
locked and loaded,
ready for my go-ahead, just in case.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.749
Absolutely.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.876
Colonel, I think I may have something.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.110
I've been working under the assumption
that, as you suggested,

27:52.200 --> 27:53.838
the device they took
must have been broadcasting

27:53.920 --> 27:56.434
- some sort of subspace communication.
- You can trace it?

27:56.520 --> 27:58.511
Well, yeah, if it was broadcasting
from Atlantis, yes.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.636
But, obviously,
it's not doing that anymore.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.392
- So?
- So...

28:02.480 --> 28:05.517
Well, I'm using the work of László Babai
as a stepping stone.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.750
You know? Combinatorics and...

28:08.400 --> 28:10.516
No offense, but the math I'm using
is so complicated,

28:10.600 --> 28:12.636
I don't know if I can dumb it down enough
for it to make sense.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.039
Try.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.749
Well, okay, I've been going over
our recorded subspace logs,

28:16.840 --> 28:18.751
and I'm trying to extrapolate
the single thread

28:18.840 --> 28:21.229
that will lead us to the area of space
associated with the device.

28:21.320 --> 28:22.639
Well, I understand that.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.517
Yes. It doesn't accurately represent
what I'm doing, but...

28:24.600 --> 28:27.068
I get it. What you're doing
is difficult. Just...

28:27.160 --> 28:29.196
Tell me when you get a hit.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.874
This facility is tapped into
some pretty serious power generation.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.359
I've never seen anything like it before.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.509
- You'd need a lot of power.
- What?

28:47.800 --> 28:50.678
- I think I know what this thing does.
- What?

28:50.760 --> 28:53.877
- It's an endgame machine.
- How so?

28:53.960 --> 28:55.029
If it works the way I think it does,

28:55.120 --> 28:57.714
it would mean the end of the Wraith
once and for all.

28:58.320 --> 29:01.596
So how do you destroy the Wraith
once and for all?

29:01.680 --> 29:04.114
Well, I never said "destroy. "
I mean, it would lead to that, I suppose,

29:04.200 --> 29:06.589
but this device would stop them
dead in their tracks.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.956
- How?
- It creates a very specific subspace static.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.758
Turbulence is probably
a better way of looking at it.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.398
- Which...
- Okay, look.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.598
Although they're all based
on a fairly similar technological premise,

29:16.680 --> 29:19.433
each race has a slightly
different type of hyperdrive.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.351
Ours are based on the Asgard drives,
with our own little twist.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.509
The Ancients had
their own particular system,

29:22.600 --> 29:24.989
and the Wraith, again, have
their own separate hyperdrive technology.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.593
- All right.
- Okay, so at its base level,

29:26.680 --> 29:28.511
a hyperdrive allows you
to travel great distances

29:28.600 --> 29:29.828
by entering and exiting subspace.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.319
Okay, this much I already know. Yes.

29:31.400 --> 29:36.190
Okay, so, if this machine is capable
of actually functioning safely,

29:36.280 --> 29:39.431
it disrupts the very specific
subspace frequencies the Wraith use.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.839
So they wouldn't be able
to engage their hyperdrive.

29:40.920 --> 29:43.354
Well, no, that's the genius. They would
be able to engage their hyperdrive,

29:43.440 --> 29:45.749
it's just that their particular channel
of subspace would be destabilized

29:45.840 --> 29:47.398
and their ship would be ripped
into a million pieces.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.469
When this device is turned on,

29:48.560 --> 29:50.596
every time a Wraith ship
enters hyperspace, it self-destructs?

29:50.680 --> 29:52.193
- Yeah.
- That's a pretty effective idea.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.430
Yeah! I mean, because
even if word got back to the other Wraith

29:54.520 --> 29:56.397
that the ships should stop using
their hyperdrives,

29:56.480 --> 29:57.469
they'd be stuck where they were.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.118
They'd only be able to travel
using sublight engines.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.519
And because an Ancient ship's
hyperdrives operate

30:00.600 --> 30:01.715
on a different frequency of subspace,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.995
the Ancients could fly around the galaxy
and pick them off one by one.

30:04.080 --> 30:06.548
Yeah, or just leave them to die
in the vastness of space.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.677
- So, what's the catch?
- Well, the catch is

30:09.760 --> 30:13.070
that Janus ran a three-day test
about 10,000 years ago,

30:13.160 --> 30:17.073
and then shut the whole project down
because of unforeseen side effects.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.232
- Right, which were?
- Well, it's not clear.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.592
But that's the key to the whole shebang.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.398
Janus brought that
back with him to Atlantis,

30:24.480 --> 30:26.436
but kept it connected
to the main system here.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.509
One won't work without the other.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.192
They seem pretty convinced
we can make it operational.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.269
That's 'cause we probably can.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.794
I mean, we have everything we need here.
The question is whether we should.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.632
The last time I went down this road,

30:34.720 --> 30:36.995
- I kind of destroyed a solar system.
- Yeah, and I'm not too keen

30:37.080 --> 30:38.798
about experiencing
those unforeseen side effects.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.160
- So what do we do?
- It's simple. We...

30:42.440 --> 30:44.032
We reason with them.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.395
Oh.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.638
Now, obviously, you're excited
about the possibility

30:50.720 --> 30:53.029
of ending the Wraith's reign
over this galaxy once and for all.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.918
But the reality is, this device
and this facility

30:56.000 --> 30:58.958
were abandoned by their creator
for a very good reason. See,

31:00.080 --> 31:04.392
it doesn't work, at least not safely.
That's from what my friend can tell.

31:07.360 --> 31:11.399
Look, we share the same goal.
Perhaps we have many things in common.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.475
Look, given the right amount of time,

31:16.560 --> 31:18.630
it's possible we could get the device
to function safely,

31:18.720 --> 31:22.508
but we'd have to contact our people
and bring in a much larger science team.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.717
See, I'm not that kind of scientist,
and when my friend here...

31:25.800 --> 31:30.316
Get the device operational
within one hour or I will kill him.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.399
Do you understand?

31:32.480 --> 31:34.118
I understand. Yes.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.157
- Great plan, Danny! Great plan.
- Why the suits?

31:41.240 --> 31:42.434
Huh?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.788
They're not in battle anymore.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.111
Originally, I thought it was just
their version of SWAT gear,

31:48.200 --> 31:51.158
but they still have it on.
Maybe they're more than just armor.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.674
Maybe they're some sort
of protective suit.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.194
Maybe they can't function
in our livable atmosphere.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.599
Maybe we should just add it
to the list of things

31:57.680 --> 31:59.557
that have nothing to do
with the task at hand.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.279
Those suits might be the key
to figuring out who these guys really are.

32:02.360 --> 32:06.069
You work on understanding them,
I'll work on trying not to get us killed.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.635
Well, you got something for me?

32:15.720 --> 32:19.235
Yes. There.
M6H-987, that's my best guess.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.436
- Are you sure?
- Well, about 80% sure.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.875
All right, well, it's our only lead,
it'll have to do.

32:23.960 --> 32:25.313
Doesn't happen to have
a gate on it, does it?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.072
- No.
- Of course not.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.913
Daedalus still out
of communications range?

32:29.000 --> 32:29.989
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.355
And their rendezvous point
with Todd isn't even near a stargate.

32:32.440 --> 32:33.668
All right, I need you to get
to the Jumper Bay,

32:33.760 --> 32:36.593
boost its subspace communications range
as much as you can.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.669
What are you planning?

32:37.760 --> 32:39.398
We've got to get to that planet
as soon as possible.

32:39.480 --> 32:42.074
We're going to get as near as we can
to the Daedalus with a Jumper,

32:42.160 --> 32:43.752
have them pick us up
en route to the planet.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.273
Okay. Give me half an hour.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.476
I'm going to
get the team ready.

32:49.680 --> 32:51.955
McKAY: That main chamber
houses the subspace antenna.

32:52.040 --> 32:55.555
- It harnesses the static into subspace?
- Well, it will once I light it up.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.948
What? You're already ready?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.156
Well, it wasn't broken.
He just shut it down.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.676
All we need is that, a basic understanding
of Janus's coding style,

33:02.760 --> 33:04.671
and here's where I come in again,
the Ancient gene.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.557
I mean, we're ready to roll.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.279
- Rodney, you don't have to do this.
- What?

33:09.480 --> 33:11.630
If turning this thing on means
a solar system is going to explode,

33:11.720 --> 33:12.835
then let's not.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.114
They're going to kill you.
We don't have a choice.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.189
Yes, we do.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.998
Okay, so I do nothing,
they come in here, they kill you,

33:17.080 --> 33:18.593
who gets killed next, huh? Me.

33:18.680 --> 33:20.477
To tell you the truth here,
I'm quite fond of me,

33:20.560 --> 33:23.279
so we might as well do it now,
while you're still alive,

33:23.360 --> 33:25.476
as opposed to, you know, then.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.072
- All right.
- All right.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.833
- We still alive?
- I think so.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.480
I'd hate to think heaven looks like this.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.596
Who says we went to heaven?

33:56.680 --> 33:57.954
Hmm.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.798
It's operational.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.350
Anything out of the ordinary?

34:07.680 --> 34:10.274
No. Everything is in the green.
I mean, it's working great.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.157
What about those unforeseen side effects?

34:12.239 --> 34:15.312
They're still unforeseen. But, for now,
it's working, and we're still alive.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.038
Okay, so what now?

34:17.560 --> 34:19.277
Maybe, a nice pat on the back

34:19.360 --> 34:22.237
and an all-expense-paid trip
back to Atlantis?

34:23.320 --> 34:24.389
Yeah.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.991
You have an urgent message
from your hive.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.833
I assumed you'd want to take it privately.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.268
Go ahead.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.594
Very well.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.911
Permission granted.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.351
I shall remain here.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.353
Is everything okay?

34:58.800 --> 35:02.110
One of our facilities is under attack
by a rival hive.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.318
Our two support ships
must depart for battle.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.191
My hive will remain here,

35:08.680 --> 35:11.194
continue the work with Dr. Keller.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.077
I'm glad to hear that.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.713
Not the under attack part,
that's unfortunate, of course.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.279
I just meant...

35:21.280 --> 35:22.554
Never mind.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.034
Marks, what the hell just happened?

35:40.120 --> 35:42.839
- How did you do that?
- How did we...

35:42.920 --> 35:44.399
Surely you don't think
we had anything to do with that?

35:44.480 --> 35:47.040
- You've tricked me.
What?

35:47.920 --> 35:50.309
This was your plan all along.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.838
Somehow, you've found the Attero device.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.956
The what? We have no idea what you're...

36:06.480 --> 36:08.277
Commander, we've been trying
to contact you.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.079
The other cruisers
were destroyed.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.276
I know. We've been betrayed.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.752
What should we do?

36:15.080 --> 36:17.389
I have control
of the humans ' transport system.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.232
I'll begin beaming in
our troops immediately.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.791
We're taking this ship.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.112
- Come on.
- What's going on?

36:46.200 --> 36:48.156
We're under attack. We gotta get
to the armory and get you a gun.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.389
Come on.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.669
Locked.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.115
Ronon!

37:22.680 --> 37:24.238
We're locked in.

37:27.800 --> 37:32.112
That should limit their movements.
Continue beaming in our troops.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.388
10 minutes and counting, still no problem.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.311
- Oh, boy.
- What? What is it?

37:43.400 --> 37:46.949
McKAY: I think I just found a log entry
that tells us what the side effect is.

37:47.040 --> 37:50.316
- It's not harmful radiation, is it?
- No. No, no, you and I are safe.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.197
It's just the rest of the galaxy
that's going to have problems,

37:52.280 --> 37:55.511
including Atlantis.
I've got to shut this thing down.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.275
Step away from the device.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.352
Okay, wait. There's a very dangerous,
very serious problem with the device,

38:03.440 --> 38:04.429
and we need to talk to your boss...

38:10.240 --> 38:14.028
Okay, all set.
So I'll have Chuck dial M5R-179.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.554
You should be able to contact the
Daedalus via subspace once you get there.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.358
- Nice work.
- Thanks. And good luck.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.396
Thanks, we're going to need it.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.952
All right, dial it up.

38:36.880 --> 38:39.075
What's that? What's that?

38:39.440 --> 38:41.829
We've got a power spike
at the event horizon.

38:41.920 --> 38:46.118
What? Power is building within the gate?
No, no, no. That can't happen.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.390
Colonel, do not lower the Jumper
into the Gate Room.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.708
Why not?
- Well, for some reason,

38:49.800 --> 38:51.916
there's an unprecedented
power build-up within the gate.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.719
A power build-up from where?

38:54.440 --> 38:58.194
It's coming from within the event horizon.
Oh, no. This is very, very bad for us.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.635
Just shut it down.
It's probably a faulty gate at the other end.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.996
I'm... I'm trying! It won't let me!

39:04.800 --> 39:06.791
All right, I'm coming down.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.349
What do we do, wait 38 minutes
and ride the Puddle out?

39:11.440 --> 39:13.670
I wish.
If the power continues to build like this,

39:13.760 --> 39:14.749
the gate will reach critical overload

39:14.840 --> 39:16.671
- and most certainly explode.
- Explode?

39:16.760 --> 39:17.954
Yes, I told you it was very,
very bad for us.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.759
- How does something like this happen?
- I don't know. It's never happened before.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.434
- How long do we have?
- Not very long at all. About 90 seconds.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.636
- Ninety seconds?
- I would say closer to 60.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.312
We've got to evacuate
everyone in the tower.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.516
The gate exploding is equivalent
of a dozen nuclear explosions.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.273
There's nowhere we could evacuate
quickly enough to a safe distance.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.032
- The... The shield.
- What?

39:34.120 --> 39:36.429
Collapse the city's shield around the gate,
we can contain the explosion.

39:36.520 --> 39:38.715
Yes, yes, that might just work.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.108
The gate will reach a critical limit
in five, four,

39:43.880 --> 39:45.233
three, two, one.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.472
Don't look at the blast!
- Could have mentioned that before!

39:51.560 --> 39:53.790
I'll see if I can divert
more power to the shield.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.916
I'll see if I can block more of the radiation.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.879
Okay, now what?

40:08.760 --> 40:11.479
The shield continues to diffuse
the energy of the blast.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.357
Every second that it's contained
within the shield,

40:13.440 --> 40:14.873
the explosion gets weaker.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.279
How long does it take?

40:17.480 --> 40:19.072
- Oh, no.
- What?

40:19.160 --> 40:21.913
The shield needs at least another minute
to contain the full brunt of the blast,

40:22.000 --> 40:23.513
but we're frying out the emitters.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.158
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.514
Shut down the city, transfer all the power.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.919
Yes, I'm trying.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.310
Everyone that doesn't need to be here,
get to the edge of the city.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.308
Move! Everybody!

40:34.080 --> 40:35.149
You're going to want to get out of here.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.196
- John, I...
- Teyla, please.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.955
Come on, you can do it, Radek.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.711
It's going down. We're going to make it.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.191
No. It's not enough.
