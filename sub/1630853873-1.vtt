01:24.084 --> 01:26.128
Can I put my hand in yours?

01:26.211 --> 01:27.838
No, you're too ugly.

03:00.263 --> 03:04.184
<i>The jew and France</i>

03:04.726 --> 03:08.355
GAINSBOURGI A HEROIC LIFE

03:26.915 --> 03:28.709
What now?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.836
My finger slipped-

03:44.891 --> 03:47.644
Do better than that, Lucien.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.605
Play.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.779
What is this?

04:00.282 --> 04:02.617
I don't like the piano!

04:03.160 --> 04:05.954
I'm not interested in music!

04:07.581 --> 04:10.959
Why should I learn?
You play and you earn nothing.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.669
Play.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.504
What are you up to?

04:55.587 --> 04:56.963
Just looking.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.090
No, you're not.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.176
You'll put your dirty paws everywhere!

05:05.263 --> 05:06.973
Take a hike!

05:18.360 --> 05:22.614
<i>Over us the bloodstained banner</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:25.700
<i>Of tyranny holds sway</i>

05:26.409 --> 05:29.037
<i>Of tyranny holds sway</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:32.624
<i>Oh, do you hear there in our fields...</i>

05:32.707 --> 05:37.087
<i>To slaughter sons, wives and kin...</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:40.090
<i>Blood, blood everywhere...</i>

05:44.511 --> 05:47.389
<i>The jew and France</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:48.700
Well, well, Brochaut!

06:49.409 --> 06:51.369
Not only do you smoke at work,

06:51.453 --> 06:54.581
but you also corrupt our youth.
Bravo!

06:54.664 --> 06:57.542
He gave me the cigarette, Mr. Poletti.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.837
Why are you in my office
before opening time?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.965
The kid wants his star
before the others.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.262
Thank you. If I'd been late today,

07:09.346 --> 07:11.222
I'd have been ashamed forever.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.891
<i>Hey, you...</i>

07:12.974 --> 07:15.894
Who do you think you are?

07:15.977 --> 07:20.482
I'm Lucien Ginsburg. I'm Jewish.
My dad plays piano at a bar.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.276
Eager to wear your star?

07:23.360 --> 07:27.739
It's your star, sir.
You want me to wear it.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.075
You're a cheeky one.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.535
Shouldn't you be at school?

07:32.619 --> 07:36.247
I've left school
for the Montmartre Art Academy.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.168
The Montmartre Art Academy!

07:41.336 --> 07:42.921
How about that!

07:43.004 --> 07:47.801
If they take cocky lads like you,
the place must be a disgrace!

07:47.884 --> 07:50.303
You'd be wrong to believe that, sir.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.848
Some very reputable people go there.

07:54.683 --> 07:59.187
For instance, I often see
SS Lieutenant Karl Heinz von Mayer.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.106
He likes me a lot.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.817
One day, he even gave me a brioche.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.986
What is this nonsense?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.781
Shall I introduce you?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.200
He could help your career along...

08:58.204 --> 08:59.831
What are you painting?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.499
An adventure.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.502
A little pianist.
Everyone tells him,

09:04.586 --> 09:07.589
“We're sick of seeing your mug.”

09:07.672 --> 09:10.341
So he's out of work.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.803
Even the worst dives
are sick of seeing his face.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.474
The more they say it,
the bigger his mug gets.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.728
He's helpless.
It's all anyone ever sees.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.230
It makes his life hell.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.400
He realizes he can't get rid of it,

09:27.484 --> 09:30.612
so he makes it swell up
as much as he can.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.780
In the end...

09:33.364 --> 09:34.949
it explodes.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.367
Does he die?

09:36.451 --> 09:37.202
No.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.579
His mug took such a beating,

09:39.662 --> 09:42.624
it turned into something else.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.627
Professor Flipus.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.337
Who's that?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.507
He's a really scary man,
but very elegant,

09:50.590 --> 09:52.050
so people like him.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.887
The way they like the ogres
in Brothers Grimm stories.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.306
They love to hate him.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.810
When he plays, everyone shuts up.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.061
What does he play?

10:03.144 --> 10:06.981
The stuff people like. Women mainly.
He's a ladies' man.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.638
<i>Sorry-</i>

10:38.721 --> 10:42.642
No, carry on.
You play better at night.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.825
I should have asked first.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.913
But I have to leave Paris
and can't come here again.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.251
I wanted to take a drawing of you with me.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.795
There are lots of models here,

12:33.878 --> 12:36.256
but I always wait for you.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.800
Will you pose for me?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.805
I might be a great artist one day.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.102
May I get dressed while you work,
Mr. Great Artist?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.687
Not really.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.563
What nerve!

12:52.647 --> 12:57.235
It's not the clothes.
If you move too much, I can't draw.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.570
I'll stay like this then?

12:59.654 --> 13:00.321
No.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.614
What?

13:02.198 --> 13:06.035
It's the bra...
I don't know how to draw one.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.662
We could take it off...

13:11.833 --> 13:14.794
My family has to hide.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.840
Once the war ends,
I'LL come to find you.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.592
I'll be too old!

13:21.676 --> 13:23.469
No, I'LL still fancy you.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.221
I doubt it.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.641
<i>I'll</i> seduce women who look like you.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.937
What a pretty little girl!

13:34.147 --> 13:35.773
I'm a guy!

13:37.859 --> 13:40.028
Forgive me, little one.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.031
You have a very pretty mom.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.951
Not my mother, my model.
I'm a painter.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.953
- What?
- It's Fréhel!

13:49.037 --> 13:50.913
Madame Fréhel?

13:50.997 --> 13:53.333
If I've made a blunder,

13:53.875 --> 13:57.587
let me buy you a cordial,
to apologize.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.213
Only natural.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.466
What do you say?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.633
Dickhead.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.886
<i>This fellow...</i>

14:05.887 --> 14:09.682
He's my model too.
My little model.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.642
Boss man!

14:11.726 --> 14:14.103
Get out the lemonade!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.567
I had a son too, you know.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.905
But my job kept me too busy
to take care of him,

14:23.988 --> 14:26.866
so I left him with a wretched nurse

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
who let him starve to death.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.873
You mustn't starve to death, ok?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.751
I know one of your songs.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.254
All of it? That's wonderful!
Sing it for me.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.261
- No.
- Not that one?

14:47.345 --> 14:49.972
All the children sing it.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.142
Later. The one I know is The <i>Coke.</i>

14:53.226 --> 14:55.269
That's no song for a boy!

14:55.353 --> 14:57.814
But I'm wiser than my years.

14:59.649 --> 15:03.694
<i>The band played a dashing tango tune</i>

15:03.778 --> 15:07.240
<i>His beauty was spinning in his arms</i>

15:07.323 --> 15:11.411
<i>And, in my hand, I gripped a knife</i>

15:11.494 --> 15:15.706
<i>And I took my bitter revenge</i>

15:22.964 --> 15:27.218
<i>Yes, I was tipsy, I did a dumb thing</i>

15:27.301 --> 15:31.180
<i>I killed my gigolo</i>

15:31.264 --> 15:35.476
<i>In front of my friends,
like a silly tart</i>

15:35.560 --> 15:39.439
<i>I plunged my knife into his heart</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:41.524
<i>Let me have some coke</i>

15:42.233 --> 15:45.111
<i>To give my brain a poke</i>

15:47.488 --> 15:50.032
<i>Let me have some coke</i>

15:50.116 --> 15:52.577
<i>To give my brain a poke</i>

15:55.830 --> 15:58.166
Your teacher is Mademoiselle Lax.

15:58.249 --> 16:01.002
You'll like her.
She's kind.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.421
What else... There's a choir.

16:03.504 --> 16:08.050
Practice is every Wednesday evening
with Father Barratier.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.136
He's very kind, you'll see.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.097
This is the country.
It's nice and quiet.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.654
Lucien, can you put more hairs on mine?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.114
There's no more room!

16:30.198 --> 16:32.575
Not on her pussy, under her arms.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.452
I like hairy armpits.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.370
You're a bunch of hicks!

16:36.454 --> 16:37.955
So are you.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.713
Not bad. You draw well.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.092
Could you draw me Paulette Dubost
in the nude?

17:02.396 --> 17:04.398
Hey, kiddo!

17:05.983 --> 17:09.487
The Germans are coming.
Your mug will give you away.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.948
Take this ax to the woods.

17:12.031 --> 17:17.286
Just say you're the lumberjack's son
off gathering branches.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.913
Let's go.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.584
Come on, we have to hide.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.550
We'll build a hut
<i>like in The Last of the Mohicans.</i>

17:30.633 --> 17:34.220
No fires.
Nothing to give us away to the enemy.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.446
Lucien!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.328
What's going on?

18:00.621 --> 18:04.250
You took no food. Here's some sausage.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.970
You were right to hide.
They looked everywhere for jews.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.806
So? That doesn't concern me.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.684
- Why hide then?
— I have a date.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.770
Scram, she'll be here soon.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.355
She?

18:26.439 --> 18:29.859
Yes. When I have a rendezvous,
it's with a chick.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.237
How else did I learn
to draw pussy hairs?

18:48.836 --> 18:51.672
I'm cold.
I've been waiting too long.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.842
Sorry. I've kept you waiting.

18:56.719 --> 19:00.139
I have to make you pose outdoors today.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.606
You haven't written much.

19:08.689 --> 19:12.318
No. I draw you every day.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.696
Could you take
your clothes off, please?

19:15.780 --> 19:18.199
I'm already naked.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.702
But I feel cold here.
Can I snuggle against you?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.871
If you like.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.430
Lucien, I feel good.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.683
Will you marry me?

19:43.766 --> 19:45.810
No way, baby.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.980
Kiss me on the mouth...
with your tongue.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.649
Really?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.109
If you insist.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.821
Then you pose.
You're not here to mess about.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.030
Yes.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.574
But recite a poem to warm my heart.

20:04.495 --> 20:09.083
“Your eyes where nothing is revealed
Neither bitter nor sweet

20:10.126 --> 20:15.005
Are two cold jewels that mingle
iron with gold

20:15.715 --> 20:19.802
To see you walking in cadence
with fine abandon

20:21.011 --> 20:25.433
One imagines a snake that dances
at the end of a staff

20:26.559 --> 20:31.272
Beneath the weight of indolence
your childlike head

20:32.231 --> 20:36.944
Sways gently with all the sluggishness
of a young elephant.”

20:37.778 --> 20:42.491
<i>And your body leans and stretches
like a slender vessel</i>

20:43.242 --> 20:48.122
<i>That pitches from side to side and dips
its yardarms in the sea</i>

20:49.206 --> 20:53.753
<i>Like a torrent swollen by the thaw
of rumbling glaciers</i>

20:54.837 --> 20:59.300
<i>When the water of your mouth rises
to the edge of your teeth</i>

21:00.217 --> 21:04.472
<i>I feel I'm drinking Bohemian wine
Bitter and conquering</i>

21:05.055 --> 21:10.352
<i>A liquid sky that scatters
stars in my heart</i>

21:10.436 --> 21:12.021
Well, well...

21:12.104 --> 21:14.190
Baudelaire first thing.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.525
Am I here too early?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.820
The light is best at daybreak.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.281
Get undressed.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.824
What for?

21:24.575 --> 21:26.535
I'm not a model.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.333
Sorry. In that case...

21:32.416 --> 21:34.418
I'LL stay dressed for now.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.505
Of course.
I'LL help you set up.

21:55.815 --> 22:00.361
The light in this spot is perfect
if you're right-handed.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.951
Are you always here so early?

22:07.034 --> 22:09.537
I haven't slept. I play the piano.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.413
So do I.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.918
What do you PW?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.336
Bach.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.215
Ah, right...
I play piano bar stuff.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.634
I have no illusions about it.

22:23.717 --> 22:27.388
I only do it to pay for my canvases.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.224
Where do you play?
I'LL come and listen.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.060
No, certainly not.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.646
You can't stop me.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.232
What if I don't tell you where?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.026
That'll be even more fun.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.361
<i>I'll follow you.</i>

22:42.444 --> 22:43.988
What if I forbid you to?

22:44.071 --> 22:47.283
Even better.
I'LL follow you in secret.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.097
I'm not a jukebox!
Who do you take me for?

23:27.531 --> 23:29.867
<i>Because your eyes are blue</i>

23:31.285 --> 23:36.123
<i>Because your hair defies the sun
with its fiery sheen</i>

23:38.918 --> 23:40.669
<i>Because you're twenty</i>

23:42.379 --> 23:47.301
<i>Because you bite in to life
like into a red apple plucked in joy.</i> ..

23:48.260 --> 23:50.054
Pretty. You wrote it?

23:50.137 --> 23:51.263
Aznavour.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.331
He leaves old masters on the floor.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.208
I know.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.753
But his own works go on the wall.

24:24.463 --> 24:28.842
He can spend all evening
looking for his name in the papers.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.596
If he doesn't see Salvador Dali once,

24:32.680 --> 24:34.098
he gets furious.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.559
I do the same,
but I never find my name.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.105
That's tragic.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.148
Absolutely.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.573
I can't really draw you.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.576
I'm easy enough to do.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.328
Yes. But...

24:56.412 --> 24:58.706
I want to kiss you.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.167
How am I supposed to concentrate?

25:04.420 --> 25:07.172
How do you think Klimt managed it?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.719
He was always drawing
irresistible girls,

25:12.219 --> 25:15.264
putting their fingers
in different places...

25:15.347 --> 25:17.725
But his work was clear and precise.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.394
I don't know.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.230
Even drawing you dressed,
I get excited.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.233
Lucien...

25:29.028 --> 25:30.904
I was thinking...

25:32.531 --> 25:34.033
Klimt...

25:34.658 --> 25:38.245
He screwed them first,
then he drew them, right?

25:42.916 --> 25:45.419
I'll finish this later.

26:01.185 --> 26:04.688
<i>Not on... Not on Dali's bed...</i>

26:04.772 --> 26:07.483
<i>Not on Dali's bed. I couldn't...</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:40.891
Elisabeth, I can't sleep.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.977
Count animals.

26:45.229 --> 26:49.817
Imagine a big panda nibbling its way
through a bamboo grove.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.735
Then it vanishes.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.322
Now think of a second panda
in the bamboo grove.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.992
It looks at you...

26:59.952 --> 27:01.995
Then it vanishes as well.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.749
Now a third panda...

27:05.833 --> 27:08.418
All these pandas are freaking me out.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.964
I hear voices night and day.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.925
If I don't write or paint,

27:15.008 --> 27:17.511
they get louder and louder.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.389
It's too much to deal with.

27:21.223 --> 27:24.101
It's not me speaking,
it's another voice.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.228
<i>Yeah...</i>

27:27.187 --> 27:29.064
You're possessed.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.275
Some nuns have that too.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.568
A devil inside.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.862
Don't exaggerate.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.073
The devil is your double.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.870
It's someone you can talk to.
All great writers have one.

27:42.953 --> 27:45.205
Ok, but how do I get to sleep?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.665
You obey me!

27:46.748 --> 27:50.294
Drop the art crap.
I'LL make you a fortune, pal!

27:50.377 --> 27:53.297
But I love painting.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.424
What are you saying?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.510
Don't worry.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.470
She's been asleep for ages.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.931
Who are you? Why are you here?

28:03.015 --> 28:05.100
Hey, don't be so stuck-up.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.810
I'm your mug.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.563
Don't you recognize your ugly mug?

28:10.397 --> 28:12.357
You've grown so much!

28:12.900 --> 28:15.652
You've become hideous.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.029
What do you want?

28:17.112 --> 28:20.449
I have things to offer you.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.954
- Who are you talking to?
- To my mug.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.497
Forget it.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.798
You know Yiddish folklore?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.258
A little.

28:38.342 --> 28:41.011
Russian tunes mainly and jazz.

28:41.094 --> 28:44.890
I'd advise you to be tactful,
not to clown around.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.267
These children are fragile.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.687
They're sick?
I wasn't told about that.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.522
We take in children

28:52.606 --> 28:55.734
whose parents never returned
from the German camps.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.820
It's hard to describe these children.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.616
They seem petrified at times.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.494
I'm not right for this. Sorry.

29:05.577 --> 29:09.122
Won't you spend a little while
with them?

29:09.706 --> 29:12.084
Just today. To help me out.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.049
Go on...

29:19.132 --> 29:20.634
Go on.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.302
Go on!

29:24.805 --> 29:26.974
I'm Lucien.
Take your instruments.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.568
Let's see what you know.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.760
Over to you!

32:09.928 --> 32:11.555
<i>No, I...</i>

32:11.638 --> 32:14.433
I'm useless at improvising.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.686
Go to your dad's
and play piano then.

32:18.645 --> 32:22.023
I learn Django's chords
that you wrote for me.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.859
Django can't write.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.485
You think that helps?

32:25.569 --> 32:28.029
At least he looks at his guitar.

32:28.989 --> 32:30.115
Go on.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.867
Look at it...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.994
and tell yourself a story.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.121
Plain and simple.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.247
With words?

32:37.330 --> 32:38.999
No, just notes.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.333
A minor chord?

32:42.586 --> 32:45.005
Django can't name the notes,

32:46.256 --> 32:48.467
but he can play them.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.478
See you next week?

33:41.144 --> 33:43.647
About the guitar,

33:43.730 --> 33:45.315
go for it!

33:45.398 --> 33:47.526
Work at it night and day

33:47.609 --> 33:50.570
and show him
what you can do next week!

33:51.780 --> 33:54.866
What'll you do
to play like Django Reinhardt?

33:54.950 --> 33:58.370
Django uses two fingers!

33:59.663 --> 34:02.415
The rest, he doesn't need.

34:03.416 --> 34:07.295
The rest can be sacrificed!

34:07.879 --> 34:08.880
<i>Look...</i>

34:08.964 --> 34:11.174
With just two fingers.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.133
That's how it goes.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.635
You need to make sacrifices.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.472
I told you to drop
the painting and all...

35:00.140 --> 35:01.850
I mean...

35:01.933 --> 35:04.394
Take a look around you.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.272
Seen your wife?

35:07.355 --> 35:10.150
What? I find her attractive.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.944
No. You used to.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.988
You're a real scumbag.

35:15.822 --> 35:20.368
<i>She's a Rubens, she's a hippopodame</i>

35:20.452 --> 35:23.371
<i>With a “D” like in marshmallow</i>

35:25.081 --> 35:28.126
<i>I've got a thing
for this hippopodame</i>

35:29.252 --> 35:32.672
<i>Because with her, I get the bulk rate</i>

35:33.673 --> 35:38.094
<i>What suspense on my hippopodame</i>

35:38.178 --> 35:42.182
<i>With a “D” like in take it easy</i>

35:42.515 --> 35:46.478
<i>The springs creak under the hippopodame</i>

35:47.062 --> 35:50.940
<i>But on top of her,
I can get under her skin</i>

35:52.442 --> 35:54.569
<i>All those losers leave me cold</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:57.364
<i>And only Antoine gets me hot</i>

35:57.989 --> 36:01.034
<i>My feelings for him are so deep</i>

36:01.117 --> 36:04.704
<i>Only he has got to the depths of me</i>

36:04.788 --> 36:07.540
<i>Antoine acts tough</i>

36:08.083 --> 36:10.835
<i>But he's never stuck-up</i>

36:11.544 --> 36:14.756
<i>I'm his moll, I'm his chick</i>

36:14.839 --> 36:17.217
<i>Antoine is the man for me!</i>

36:21.179 --> 36:23.932
A song by Lucien Ginsburg!

36:28.561 --> 36:30.355
This is fame, pal.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.233
I'm heading straight back to painting.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.026
Cut the crap.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.194
Boris Vian...

36:36.277 --> 36:39.447
You're lucky. He's come to hear you.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.242
I only heard the last song.

36:42.325 --> 36:45.078
It's good. Keep at it.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.595
“The Fried land Wooden Leg.”

37:05.306 --> 37:09.811
<i>There was once a wooden leg
out looking for a taker</i>

37:10.854 --> 37:13.773
<i>It told itself,
“If no one wants me,</i>

37:13.857 --> 37:16.109
<i>I'll shoot myself in the heart.”</i>

37:16.192 --> 37:21.030
<i>Out on the battlefield
amid the volleys of shots</i>

37:21.114 --> 37:25.118
<i>It met this cannonball
whistling with all its might</i>

37:25.785 --> 37:29.956
<i>It told him, “You look cute.
You're off to kill Cossacks</i>

37:30.039 --> 37:33.626
<i>Be a dear just for me
before launching the attack.</i>

37:34.586 --> 37:37.255
<i>I don't like the Russkies, see</i>

37:37.338 --> 37:40.550
<i>So help me out
and change sides a second</i>

37:40.633 --> 37:43.511
<i>Aim for that French officer there”</i>

37:43.595 --> 37:44.679
That sucks!

37:44.763 --> 37:46.848
Shut up!

37:46.931 --> 37:50.727
<i>“Swipe off his pin
and take my word for it</i>

37:50.810 --> 37:54.481
<i>If gangrene doesn't settle in
I 'II be his wooden leg”</i>

37:54.564 --> 37:55.815
Brilliant!

38:00.069 --> 38:02.614
Don't you feel I lack a little...

38:03.323 --> 38:04.824
What?

38:05.533 --> 38:07.952
Stage presence.

38:08.036 --> 38:12.123
Yes. It's clear it pisses you off.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.503
I'm putting up the Fréres jacques.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.338
I love them!

38:20.673 --> 38:21.883
<i>Look...</i>

38:21.966 --> 38:24.010
They're all here...

38:25.261 --> 38:26.471
<i>Grumpy...</i>

38:29.808 --> 38:31.017
Dopey...

38:34.604 --> 38:35.730
<i>Doc...</i>

38:37.398 --> 38:39.484
sleepy-

38:59.921 --> 39:01.381
<i>I drink</i>

39:01.798 --> 39:04.008
<i>Systematically</i>

39:04.801 --> 39:09.764
<i>To forget my wife's male friends</i>

39:10.557 --> 39:12.058
<i>I drink</i>

39:12.141 --> 39:14.435
<i>Systematically</i>

39:15.353 --> 39:19.691
<i>To forget the worries life sends</i>

39:22.360 --> 39:26.781
<i>I drink way too much</i>

39:26.865 --> 39:30.910
<i>I see pink elephants</i>

39:30.994 --> 39:35.415
<i>Spiders on my tuxedo front</i>

39:35.498 --> 39:40.587
<i>Bats on the ceiling of my living room</i>

39:42.505 --> 39:46.593
<i>I drink whenever! have the time</i>

39:47.010 --> 39:50.972
<i>To be drunk enough to forget my mug</i>

39:51.848 --> 39:56.853
<i>I drink without enjoying it</i>

39:56.936 --> 40:01.608
<i>To avoid thinking I should end it all</i>

40:12.952 --> 40:13.912
<i>Love...</i>

40:13.995 --> 40:15.121
<i>I drink.</i> ..

40:15.204 --> 40:18.416
<i>Means nothing anymore</i>

40:18.499 --> 40:19.584
<i>I drink</i>

40:19.667 --> 40:24.547
<i>The pink elephants
The spiders on my tuxedo</i>

40:24.631 --> 40:26.424
<i>Systematically</i>

40:26.507 --> 40:29.177
<i>The bats on the ceiling</i>

40:29.260 --> 40:31.095
<i>The worries life sends</i>

40:31.179 --> 40:37.644
<i>I drink</i>

40:52.909 --> 40:54.994
Coffee! Some bread, sir?

40:55.078 --> 40:56.454
What time is it?

40:56.537 --> 40:59.832
The right time, sir.
Breakfast for the pianist!

41:08.800 --> 41:10.009
Incredible...

41:10.510 --> 41:12.637
We're all-around athletes

41:12.720 --> 41:17.100
whose biceps serve the cause
of popular songs!

41:17.183 --> 41:21.104
I thought you only did choreography
on stage.

41:21.187 --> 41:25.942
Are you joking? The job requires
total sincerity, as you'll learn.

41:26.025 --> 41:31.030
My girl won't believe
the Frères jacques buttered my bread.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.116
The audience has to believe it.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.910
You don't know her, she's a hellcat.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.538
Time for me to go.
Thanks for the show.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.747
Don't go!

41:39.831 --> 41:41.708
Sir hasn't paid!

41:41.791 --> 41:44.252
— The rascal!
- I'm broke.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.213
Never mind.
Sing us something instead.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.718
A quick one then.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.975
<i>I punch tickets on the metro line</i>

41:59.392 --> 42:01.894
<i>The guy you pass but never see</i>

42:02.437 --> 42:06.357
<i>There's no sun underground
The ride's a weird one</i>

42:06.441 --> 42:10.153
<i>To pass time, I bring
pages from Reader's Digest</i>

42:10.486 --> 42:11.779
And then...

42:11.863 --> 42:13.823
I have to go. My girl will be mad.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.575
Get lost then!

42:15.658 --> 42:19.537
But leave us your song, <i>Mr...</i>
Mr. what?

42:19.620 --> 42:21.789
Lucien. Lucien Ginsburg.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.834
Lucien sounds
like a hairdresser's boy.

42:24.917 --> 42:26.919
You need a new name.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.842
<i>I punch tickets on the metro line</i>

42:32.925 --> 42:36.012
<i>North and South, East and West</i>

42:36.095 --> 42:39.974
<i>I'm sick to death
of life in this pit</i>

42:40.058 --> 42:43.644
<i>I want to get some air
Leave my cap hanging there</i>

42:43.728 --> 42:49.567
<i>A day will come I know
when away from here I'll go</i>

42:49.650 --> 42:53.488
<i>That day I'll hit the road
however heavy my load</i>

42:53.571 --> 42:57.033
<i>And if it comes too late
I'll give up the wait</i>

42:57.116 --> 43:00.036
<i>Punching holes, then more holes</i>

43:00.119 --> 43:03.039
<i>Holes and holes
Holes day in, day out</i>

43:03.122 --> 43:09.087
<i>It's enough to drive you mad
Get a gun, do something bad</i>

43:09.170 --> 43:12.006
<i>And make a hole
One last tiny hole</i>

43:12.090 --> 43:14.550
<i>A tiny hole
One last tiny hole</i>

43:14.634 --> 43:17.470
<i>Then one big hole
And no more holes</i>

43:17.553 --> 43:21.974
<i>No more talk of holes
Of tiny little holes...</i>

43:29.315 --> 43:33.736
Thank you, you apathetic lot.
The first Gainsbourg concerto,

43:33.820 --> 43:35.863
with words and music

43:35.947 --> 43:38.032
by Serge Gainsbourg!

43:42.912 --> 43:44.997
Did you write it?

43:45.456 --> 43:46.874
Absolutely.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.876
That's lucky. I'm a singer.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.504
Serge, let's go.

43:53.172 --> 43:56.175
For a song, write to me at my parents'.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.177
Rue Chaptal, Paris 9.

44:11.732 --> 44:14.694
<i>I punch tickets on the metro line</i>

44:15.111 --> 44:18.030
<i>Heads of state
don't even know my face</i>

44:19.198 --> 44:22.952
<i>My son is a star
A star</i>

44:23.035 --> 44:27.874
<i>But week in, week out
he comes to see his Mom and Dad...</i>

44:29.292 --> 44:32.378
Lucien, I always said
popular songs are shit.

44:32.461 --> 44:33.588
Yes, Dad.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.090
But I'm proud anyway.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.805
I have lots more letters for you.

44:42.889 --> 44:43.973
Show me.

44:44.056 --> 44:46.726
It's none of my business, but some

44:46.809 --> 44:49.145
have fancy writing on them.

44:49.228 --> 44:52.398
I don't think it's government mail.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.570
Your girl will be furious with me.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.405
She hates you already.

44:59.864 --> 45:04.535
What if your mother sees
we're getting love letters for you?

45:04.619 --> 45:07.413
Mom just wants me to dump her.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.873
Maybe.

45:08.956 --> 45:12.168
But leaving and cheating
aren't the same.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.753
Dad!

45:22.887 --> 45:24.764
May I read them?

45:28.267 --> 45:31.771
You can open all these.
<i>I'll</i> open this one later.

45:31.854 --> 45:34.315
Why? Secrets from your dad now?

45:34.398 --> 45:37.235
No secrets. It's work, that's all.

45:37.318 --> 45:39.195
So why hide it?

45:39.278 --> 45:40.279
Don't insist.

45:40.363 --> 45:42.573
It's human nature to insist.

45:43.824 --> 45:48.037
The Lord God gave Adam and Eve
the whole Garden of Eden,

45:48.454 --> 45:50.414
with one tree off-limits.

45:50.498 --> 45:53.668
And that was the one tree
that interested them.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.544
Yes, Dad, I know,

45:55.628 --> 45:59.048
but the Lord's telling you
to give me a break!

46:00.424 --> 46:02.343
Mom! Hide everything!

46:05.221 --> 46:07.390
What a useless family!

46:07.473 --> 46:09.725
Lucien is here and no one told me.

46:10.977 --> 46:12.853
I just got here.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.398
Staying for dinner?

46:15.481 --> 46:16.315
No.

46:16.399 --> 46:18.109
Want some borscht?

46:18.192 --> 46:21.237
No thanks, Morn. Your bottles...

46:21.946 --> 46:24.573
they leak and I get it everywhere.

46:24.657 --> 46:25.700
Here.

46:25.783 --> 46:28.828
I don't know why I bother.

46:28.911 --> 46:31.205
Your woman will throw it out.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.499
- Don't say that.
- I know.

46:40.506 --> 46:41.966
Lucien...

46:42.758 --> 46:45.011
Who's this girl writing to you?

46:45.386 --> 46:47.221
You think <i>I'll</i> tell you?

46:48.681 --> 46:49.932
Is she a singer?

46:50.016 --> 46:51.726
I'm not saying.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.352
Is she famous?

46:53.436 --> 46:55.021
You won't know.

46:58.691 --> 47:00.067
Juliette Gréco.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.696
Who's Juliette Gréco?

47:08.117 --> 47:10.244
Don't go to see her.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.331
Stop exaggerating things...

47:13.414 --> 47:17.293
How many women drive their men
to Gréco's at night?

47:17.376 --> 47:19.045
Men who can't drive...

47:19.712 --> 47:22.590
We'll get a taxi next time.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.988
What are you waiting for?

47:46.822 --> 47:50.493
Get off my back, ok!
I'm catching my breath.

47:50.576 --> 47:52.078
The hell you are!

47:52.161 --> 47:55.122
— Come on!
- Shift just go!

47:56.665 --> 47:59.418
Is this clear enough?

48:00.294 --> 48:03.923
Cut it out. I'm on your side.

48:04.840 --> 48:09.053
If you want to seduce Gréco,
go with the flow.

48:09.804 --> 48:13.599
I'm here to sell songs,
not to seduce her.

48:14.725 --> 48:18.270
You think she sent for you
this late at night

48:18.354 --> 48:21.107
just to hear you sing?

48:21.190 --> 48:23.109
Stop touching me, ok?

48:28.489 --> 48:30.658
Mr. Gainsbourg?

48:31.117 --> 48:34.495
My mistress said
you can wait in the lounge.

48:34.578 --> 48:36.247
Drink what you like.

48:36.330 --> 48:38.290
I have the evening off.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.166
Doing the housework?

49:21.041 --> 49:22.835
I have staff for that.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.017
I like your songs.

49:40.186 --> 49:41.854
And I love you.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.443
See, we do agree on something.

49:48.486 --> 49:51.489
We love each other. We're lucky.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.374
Excuse me, I'm totally hopeless.

50:11.383 --> 50:13.219
You find me funny?

50:13.928 --> 50:15.721
I'll play something.

50:34.156 --> 50:36.283
<i>Because your eyes are blue</i>

50:37.952 --> 50:40.162
<i>Because your hair defies the sun...</i>

50:40.246 --> 50:41.914
I have dark eyes.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.752
If I'd wanted to hear Aznavour,

50:46.835 --> 50:49.755
I wouldn't have sent
for Serge Gainsbourg.

51:08.649 --> 51:11.569
<i>This</i> is <i>called The Javanaise.</i>

51:23.998 --> 51:28.127
<i>I admit I've suffered
Unlike you, my love</i>

51:29.295 --> 51:33.549
<i>Before hearing of you, my love</i>

51:34.633 --> 51:39.346
<i>Like it or not</i>

51:39.763 --> 51:44.351
<i>Dancing the Javanaise</i>

51:44.977 --> 51:48.731
<i>We were in love</i>

51:48.814 --> 51:53.819
<i>As long as the song lasted</i>

51:54.570 --> 51:56.238
I like it.

51:56.322 --> 51:58.741
How do you dance the Javanaise?

51:59.491 --> 52:01.327
I don't dance well.

52:08.292 --> 52:09.960
May I?

52:17.509 --> 52:21.639
<i>What do you think
we've seen of love?</i>

52:22.514 --> 52:26.518
<i>To tell the truth
you tricked me, my love</i>

52:27.561 --> 52:32.399
<i>Like it or not</i>

52:46.997 --> 52:52.002
<i>Like it or not</i>

52:52.086 --> 52:56.674
<i>Dancing the Javanaise</i>

52:57.091 --> 53:00.469
<i>We were in love</i>

53:00.552 --> 53:05.599
<i>As long as the song lasted</i>

53:06.642 --> 53:11.230
<i>Alas, April returns me
to love in vain</i>

53:11.814 --> 53:13.857
<i>I wanted...</i>

53:14.274 --> 53:16.360
Expecting someone?

53:20.614 --> 53:21.865
It's for you.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.283
Corning, Serge?

53:38.257 --> 53:43.303
<i>I wanted to see
that love in you</i>

53:43.846 --> 53:48.267
<i>Like it or not</i>

53:49.184 --> 53:53.313
<i>Dancing the Javanaise</i>

53:54.398 --> 53:58.360
<i>We were in love</i>

53:58.444 --> 54:06.243
<i>As long as the song lasted</i>

54:10.873 --> 54:13.333
Don't you ever sleep?

54:13.417 --> 54:15.377
Come here!

54:15.461 --> 54:17.504
Carry me in your arms.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.100
Serge...

54:30.184 --> 54:31.310
Coming?

54:31.393 --> 54:33.562
Serge...

54:35.022 --> 54:36.148
Coming?

54:56.877 --> 54:58.796
Back to Gréco's?

54:59.296 --> 55:02.174
I was a total flop at Gréco's.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.301
Take me to my parents'.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.262
She loves your songs.

55:07.346 --> 55:09.598
My songs are one thing!

55:09.681 --> 55:11.558
My mug is another!

55:12.851 --> 55:14.436
You're mistaken.

55:14.520 --> 55:18.440
<i>I'LL</i> drop you at your parents'
and head over to Gréco's.

55:18.524 --> 55:21.068
You go nowhere without me!

55:24.613 --> 55:28.867
<i>L-A-E-T-I-T-I-A</i>

56:52.910 --> 56:54.953
That's music, see.

56:56.288 --> 56:57.623
Fantastic.

56:57.706 --> 57:01.251
You'll sell three copies.
To your parents and yourself.

57:01.627 --> 57:03.670
Write for johnny Hallyday.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.547
I'd rather die!

57:05.964 --> 57:08.717
- Sheila then?
— Get off my back!

57:09.801 --> 57:12.554
I don't write for prepubescent girls.

57:12.638 --> 57:16.725
Why are you rereading Lolita then?

57:16.808 --> 57:20.687
That's different.
I'm fine with corrupting youth.

57:20.771 --> 57:21.730
So do that.

57:21.813 --> 57:24.274
You'd give them what they want.

57:24.358 --> 57:27.069
Just pretend.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.655
Make some poisoned apples.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.408
Maybe...

57:35.369 --> 57:37.579
Turn some 20-year-old

57:37.663 --> 57:39.706
into an object of scandal and desire.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.084
France Gall?

57:43.418 --> 57:44.670
No.

57:45.712 --> 57:47.965
I set up a meeting
with her father.

57:51.051 --> 57:54.346
No way. I'm not going.
France Gall!

57:55.764 --> 57:57.391
So, Mr. Gainsbourg,

57:57.474 --> 57:59.476
Joining the popsters?

57:59.851 --> 58:02.646
Take the money where it lies.

58:02.729 --> 58:06.858
Let's not be cynical.
One can be popular and demanding.

58:09.403 --> 58:13.031
Kids' tastes are strange.
They seem to like everything...

58:13.115 --> 58:15.826
They like what they're given.

58:15.909 --> 58:17.577
Not always.

58:18.704 --> 58:20.539
Do you smoke?

58:20.622 --> 58:21.289
No.

58:21.373 --> 58:23.208
Even when Dad's not looking?

58:27.045 --> 58:30.465
It's sad, but I always obey my dad.

58:30.549 --> 58:32.634
Did you like my songs?

58:32.718 --> 58:34.761
I think my father does.

58:34.845 --> 58:36.722
That's not an answer.

58:36.805 --> 58:39.182
It is. My father has taste.

58:39.891 --> 58:42.019
Everyone likes what he picks.

58:42.894 --> 58:45.480
Don't you feel like pissing him off?

58:45.564 --> 58:47.024
Why?

58:48.108 --> 58:50.777
A teacher at art school told me,

58:50.861 --> 58:54.072
“if your parents like your work,
it's shit.”

58:57.075 --> 58:59.453
Shall I write you a dirty song?

59:02.748 --> 59:04.458
See, you're laughing.

59:06.334 --> 59:08.420
My songs are work.

59:09.254 --> 59:11.715
If my father sees me
having fun...

59:11.798 --> 59:13.800
We'll do it in secret.

59:14.593 --> 59:17.554
It's all about a girl
who likes lollipops.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.347
And?

59:19.431 --> 59:23.268
Gentlemen pay her to suck lollipops...

59:24.603 --> 59:26.313
That's kid's stuff!

59:27.481 --> 59:28.940
Sweetheart!

59:29.483 --> 59:30.859
Come and sing.

59:43.789 --> 59:46.875
<i>You have dreams about love</i>

59:46.958 --> 59:50.253
<i>But one day it's bound to happen</i>

59:51.671 --> 59:55.092
<i>You'll be just another poor kid</i>

59:55.509 --> 59:58.136
<i>Alone and abandoned</i>

59:59.513 --> 1:00:02.641
<i>You'll end up getting married</i>

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:06.061
<i>Maybe even against your will</i>

1:00:07.354 --> 1:00:10.524
<i>And on your wedding night</i>

1:00:11.399 --> 1:00:14.986
<i>It'll be too late for regrets</i>

1:00:15.070 --> 1:00:18.323
<i>Sing and dance, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:22.160
<i>As if tomorrow, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:22.661 --> 1:00:25.831
<i>Shouldn't ever, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:26.331 --> 1:00:28.291
<i>Ever come again</i>

1:00:30.001 --> 1:00:33.338
<i>Sing and dance, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:36.842
<i>As if tomorrow, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:40.512
<i>As the new day dawns, Baby Pop</i>

1:00:41.179 --> 1:00:43.014
<i>You were due to die...</i>

1:00:43.557 --> 1:00:45.934
Brilliant! It'll be a huge hit!

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:50.522
Just you wait, Mr. Gainsbourg.
My girl will make you rich.

1:00:52.774 --> 1:00:55.652
<i>The threat of war</i>

1:00:56.695 --> 1:00:59.239
<i>Is clearer by the day...</i>

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:03.785
<i>At that moment, Baby, you know</i>

1:01:03.869 --> 1:01:07.038
<i>As the suns are about to rise</i>

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:11.042
<i>Somewhere on this earth</i>

1:01:12.377 --> 1:01:15.964
<i>Bullets whistle, blood is shed</i>

1:01:16.047 --> 1:01:19.342
<i>Sing and dance, Baby Pop</i>

1:01:19.801 --> 1:01:22.762
<i>As if tomorrow, Baby Pop</i>

1:01:24.014 --> 1:01:26.975
<i>Shouldn't ever, Baby Pop</i>

1:01:27.392 --> 1:01:29.978
<i>Ever come again</i>

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:33.231
<i>Who is in?</i>

1:01:34.733 --> 1:01:36.276
<i>Who is out?</i>

1:01:44.159 --> 1:01:46.578
<i>Up to 9, it's ok,
you're in</i>

1:01:50.624 --> 1:01:52.542
What's going on in there?

1:01:54.085 --> 1:01:55.545
Pardon me?

1:01:55.629 --> 1:01:58.924
This is an artists' residence,
not a bordello!

1:01:59.007 --> 1:02:02.260
No one can sleep
or practice their music!

1:02:03.678 --> 1:02:05.680
But I'm working.

1:02:05.764 --> 1:02:09.893
Sure! We hear more moans than music
from your room.

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:12.479
Been listening at my door?

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:15.357
I moved here for peace.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:19.277
The thing is, life is
chance working against destiny.

1:02:21.780 --> 1:02:23.323
Serge!

1:02:56.314 --> 1:02:58.483
Keep an eye on my dog.

1:03:00.819 --> 1:03:02.404
<i>My prince...</i>

1:03:06.408 --> 1:03:08.159
Excuse us...

1:03:26.553 --> 1:03:29.764
<i>You've read the story of Jesse James</i>

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:34.853
<i>How he lived, how he died...</i>

1:03:36.354 --> 1:03:37.605
<i>You liked it.</i>

1:03:37.689 --> 1:03:39.691
<i>You're asking for more.</i>

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:44.446
<i>So now listen to the story of...</i>

1:03:44.529 --> 1:03:46.781
<i>Bonnie and clyde.</i>

1:03:50.452 --> 1:03:51.870
Hold on.

1:03:53.038 --> 1:03:54.039
What's wrong?

1:03:54.122 --> 1:03:58.668
It's fine, but let's switch.
I start and you finish.

1:04:02.714 --> 1:04:05.925
<i>Now Clyde has a girlfriend.</i>

1:04:07.802 --> 1:04:09.387
<i>She's pretty. Her name's...</i>

1:04:09.471 --> 1:04:11.389
<i>Bonnie.</i>

1:04:11.473 --> 1:04:14.059
<i>Together, they make up the...</i>

1:04:14.142 --> 1:04:16.227
<i>Barrow Gang.</i>

1:04:16.311 --> 1:04:19.564
<i>- Their names...
— Bonnie Parker and James Barrow.</i>

1:04:19.647 --> 1:04:21.441
No, Clyde, not James.

1:04:22.442 --> 1:04:25.653
<i>Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.</i>

1:04:25.737 --> 1:04:27.322
I don't sing well.

1:04:27.405 --> 1:04:28.406
You do.

1:04:28.490 --> 1:04:29.574
I don't.

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:32.911
I can manage other people's songs.

1:04:33.453 --> 1:04:35.830
But you intimidate me.

1:04:35.914 --> 1:04:36.915
Serves you right.

1:04:36.998 --> 1:04:38.375
Watch it!

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:43.296
First time I saw you, I was terrified.

1:04:43.380 --> 1:04:46.549
You're kidding!
You came on to me right away.

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:51.930
No, I'm not talking about this year.
I'm talking about...

1:04:52.389 --> 1:04:55.809
It was ten years ago.
I was a pianist in a film.

1:04:55.892 --> 1:05:00.855
You were a huge star already.
I bet you don't even remember.

1:05:00.939 --> 1:05:02.690
I do.

1:05:02.774 --> 1:05:05.276
<i>It</i> was <i>Come Dance with Me.</i>

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:08.071
See, I do remember.

1:05:09.447 --> 1:05:10.907
And you scared me.

1:05:10.990 --> 1:05:14.536
What then?
I scare you or I intimidate you?

1:05:14.619 --> 1:05:17.539
I could tell it was easy to hurt you.

1:05:17.622 --> 1:05:19.332
That's what scares you?

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:20.458
Yes.

1:05:21.418 --> 1:05:25.755
I don't want to disappoint you
or hurt you.

1:05:27.090 --> 1:05:29.300
And I just can't sing for you.

1:05:30.218 --> 1:05:31.928
Me neither.

1:05:33.221 --> 1:05:35.473
I hear my voice and I hate it.

1:05:36.099 --> 1:05:37.809
Cancel. I'm busy.

1:05:41.312 --> 1:05:43.189
Brigitte, you'll be back soon?

1:05:43.273 --> 1:05:44.357
Of course!

1:05:51.322 --> 1:05:54.701
Just say I can't. Not today.

1:05:55.827 --> 1:05:57.412
What a drag.

1:05:57.495 --> 1:06:00.331
I shouldn't have given them
your number at work.

1:06:17.223 --> 1:06:18.475
Get off.

1:06:24.439 --> 1:06:26.357
Yes, Serge is here.

1:06:28.276 --> 1:06:30.528
Try to guess.

1:06:33.114 --> 1:06:35.658
Yes, I'm very fond of him.

1:06:36.284 --> 1:06:38.995
Can you put her on
so I can tell her?

1:06:39.621 --> 1:06:41.206
No?

1:06:41.289 --> 1:06:42.874
All right.

1:06:42.957 --> 1:06:45.168
You want to speak to Serge?

1:06:46.628 --> 1:06:48.296
Here he is.

1:06:48.379 --> 1:06:50.381
It's your father.

1:06:50.465 --> 1:06:52.050
He wants you.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:58.389
Hello, Dad?

1:06:58.473 --> 1:07:00.892
Your morn won't believe that's Bar dot.

1:07:03.353 --> 1:07:04.896
Me neither, Dad.

1:07:04.979 --> 1:07:08.066
What's wrong? Are you ashamed of us?

1:07:12.487 --> 1:07:14.030
We'll talk later.

1:07:16.157 --> 1:07:18.368
Someone was laughing a lot.

1:07:18.451 --> 1:07:22.038
<i>Brigitte Bar dot...</i>

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:33.925
Let's celebrate at the Rasputin.

1:07:34.008 --> 1:07:36.761
Why? You haven't seduced a star.

1:07:36.844 --> 1:07:39.180
You're my star, my love, my sun,

1:07:39.264 --> 1:07:41.224
and my Brigitte Bar dot...

1:07:44.978 --> 1:07:46.479
Oh, my love.

1:07:46.563 --> 1:07:50.525
Go to the piano and write me
the most beautiful love song.

1:07:52.277 --> 1:07:55.196
Say “Oh, my love” again.

1:07:58.199 --> 1:07:59.617
My <i>love...</i>

1:08:00.618 --> 1:08:01.786
No.

1:08:02.328 --> 1:08:04.747
Say, “Oh, my love.”

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:43.494
<i>Louder.</i>

1:08:45.163 --> 1:08:47.206
I'll keep you awake.

1:08:47.290 --> 1:08:49.667
I don't care.

1:09:29.207 --> 1:09:31.376
Are there any croissants?

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:35.088
No, but I have three songs.

1:09:36.839 --> 1:09:39.300
One's about motorcycles.

1:09:39.384 --> 1:09:41.886
I hate motorbikes.

1:09:41.969 --> 1:09:44.263
Pity. Thigh boots suit you.

1:09:44.347 --> 1:09:46.307
In that case...

1:09:47.475 --> 1:09:49.394
What about the love song?

1:09:50.436 --> 1:09:51.854
I don't know...

1:09:53.064 --> 1:09:55.400
<i>Did you like Barbarella?</i>

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:59.779
I have a comic-strip character...

1:10:07.412 --> 1:10:09.914
Is that how you see me?

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:19.716
<i>Come, little girl, into my comic strip</i>

1:10:19.799 --> 1:10:22.927
<i>Come make balloons, come say...</i>

1:10:29.851 --> 1:10:33.938
<i>I deal out swings and uppercuts</i>

1:11:41.088 --> 1:11:44.592
<i>Don't be scared, baby, hold on tight</i>

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:46.677
<i>I'm here...</i>

1:11:47.220 --> 1:11:49.180
<i>To protect you</i>

1:11:49.764 --> 1:11:53.434
<i>Close your eyes</i>

1:11:53.518 --> 1:11:55.394
<i>Kiss me...</i>

1:12:06.781 --> 1:12:08.741
And the last song?

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:11.619
Tell me you're mine.

1:12:11.702 --> 1:12:13.788
I feel good with you.

1:12:19.377 --> 1:12:22.046
It's my first ever love song.

1:12:23.548 --> 1:12:24.590
Want to hear it?

1:12:24.674 --> 1:12:25.716
Yes...

1:12:26.551 --> 1:12:28.970
We'll need to record it in secret.

1:12:29.053 --> 1:12:30.930
Is it indecent?

1:12:49.615 --> 1:12:53.494
Stay there.
Bardot's here, talking to Lucien.

1:12:54.161 --> 1:12:55.413
Why here?

1:13:02.253 --> 1:13:05.006
The press is at his place. It's bad.

1:13:05.089 --> 1:13:06.841
Lucien wrote her a song

1:13:06.924 --> 1:13:09.927
but her husband's furious
and won't let her sing it.

1:13:10.011 --> 1:13:12.179
Why did he pick a married woman?

1:13:12.263 --> 1:13:13.973
Shut up!

1:13:39.457 --> 1:13:41.042
Sorry to bother you.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:42.251
Not at all...

1:13:42.710 --> 1:13:45.796
ls something wrong?
A glass of water?

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.089
I have to go.

1:13:47.173 --> 1:13:48.174
No.

1:13:48.257 --> 1:13:49.550
— Something to eat?
— Yes!

1:13:49.634 --> 1:13:50.635
No, thank you.

1:13:55.473 --> 1:13:57.433
Was it a pretty song?

1:13:57.516 --> 1:14:00.937
No one has ever
declared love to me like that!

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:20.915
<i>- Lucien, what do you think?
— About what?</i>

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:23.250
<i>- The house?
- I'll take it.</i>

1:14:23.334 --> 1:14:24.460
<i>On your own?</i>

1:14:24.543 --> 1:14:26.545
<i>No, I have lots of friends.</i>

1:14:26.629 --> 1:14:29.799
<i>Didn't Gréco live on Rue de Verneuil?</i>

1:14:29.882 --> 1:14:31.425
<i>Yes, it's a good spot.</i>

1:14:31.509 --> 1:14:34.762
<i>Spend the New Year with us,
not among these boxes.</i>

1:14:34.845 --> 1:14:38.099
<i>I'm throwing a party here with friends.</i>

1:14:38.182 --> 1:14:40.184
<i>With friends, that's good.</i>

1:14:52.530 --> 1:14:55.408
<i>Oh, my love...</i>

1:15:15.553 --> 1:15:19.598
I don't give a damn,
you promised me Marisa Berenson.

1:15:19.682 --> 1:15:21.475
Instead, I get this...

1:15:21.559 --> 1:15:24.520
<i>She's wonderful!
She has a cute accent!</i>

1:15:24.603 --> 1:15:29.942
After an affair with Bar dot,
who cares about some English girl?

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:33.195
<i>Give Bar dot a rest,
I have a film to shoot.</i>

1:15:33.279 --> 1:15:34.697
<i>Go back there and...</i>

1:15:34.780 --> 1:15:39.160
All right, if it's for the film,
I'LL grant her...

1:15:41.328 --> 1:15:43.497
my polite attention.

1:15:50.463 --> 1:15:53.007
I didn't know dinner was over.

1:15:53.090 --> 1:15:55.885
I think you're pissed off at me.

1:15:56.343 --> 1:15:58.971
That's no reason to dump me like a...

1:15:59.055 --> 1:16:02.850
A kid, boring,
stupid and rude.

1:16:02.933 --> 1:16:04.810
Is that how you see me?

1:16:05.436 --> 1:16:07.146
Not at all...

1:16:07.229 --> 1:16:08.814
You detest me.

1:16:08.898 --> 1:16:12.735
If the producer
hadn't trapped us here together,

1:16:12.818 --> 1:16:15.529
you'd never have wanted to see me.

1:16:15.613 --> 1:16:17.281
No...

1:16:18.282 --> 1:16:21.744
You know, that's pretty.

1:16:26.415 --> 1:16:30.586
You said I had legs like a little girl
and a baby's dress

1:16:30.669 --> 1:16:33.339
but now you think that's good?

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:36.926
No, it's pretty when you cry.

1:16:38.177 --> 1:16:39.845
You seem so lost.

1:16:41.097 --> 1:16:42.932
Talking to someone else?

1:16:43.015 --> 1:16:44.767
A jerk of a husband like you!

1:16:44.850 --> 1:16:47.311
I've had husbands who were jerks too.

1:16:49.188 --> 1:16:50.856
You have pretty legs.

1:16:51.565 --> 1:16:55.277
Your dress is pretty too.
You're very brave...

1:16:57.321 --> 1:16:58.823
to wear it in this cold.

1:17:00.449 --> 1:17:03.953
You want me to stop crying
to get some peace.

1:17:20.469 --> 1:17:22.263
I saved your life!

1:17:28.102 --> 1:17:29.937
I always challenge death.

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:32.606
My crib was so close to my coffin.

1:17:32.690 --> 1:17:35.317
Give the fancy talk a rest!

1:17:37.153 --> 1:17:40.906
I'm a wounded animal.
I'm not trying to pick you up.

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:44.702
Talk slowly
or I can't understand a word.

1:17:46.537 --> 1:17:49.540
I said I'm trying to...

1:17:51.167 --> 1:17:53.878
resist the desire to kiss you.

1:17:55.129 --> 1:17:56.630
That's a pity.

1:17:57.381 --> 1:17:59.466
Because I really want you to.

1:19:31.141 --> 1:19:33.185
Sergio, can I see?

1:19:41.610 --> 1:19:44.530
It's no good.

1:19:49.576 --> 1:19:50.953
Let me see...

1:19:51.036 --> 1:19:54.039
No, it's terrible. I'll drown myself.

1:19:54.123 --> 1:19:55.207
Sergio!

1:19:55.291 --> 1:19:57.793
Like Ophelia in Millais's painting.

1:20:00.546 --> 1:20:02.256
You're beautiful.

1:20:02.339 --> 1:20:04.133
You're beautiful!

1:20:05.551 --> 1:20:07.511
I'm so happy!

1:20:24.028 --> 1:20:26.697
It's a tragedy.
I can't draw anymore.

1:21:30.719 --> 1:21:32.388
Sir, could you stop

1:21:32.471 --> 1:21:35.849
playing with a firearm
when we're on the beach?

1:21:35.933 --> 1:21:38.560
— I imagine it's loaded?
- Of course.

1:21:38.644 --> 1:21:41.563
Do you plan to use it in my presence?

1:21:41.647 --> 1:21:44.274
Maybe. My girl's filming with Delon.

1:21:44.358 --> 1:21:48.070
If he touches her, I'll kill them
and then myself. Good idea?

1:21:48.153 --> 1:21:50.114
No doubt, sir.

1:21:52.783 --> 1:21:54.243
What's wrong?

1:21:54.326 --> 1:21:57.413
It's the Lincoln, sir.
It's stuck in the sand.

1:21:58.038 --> 1:22:00.207
Do something, goddamn it!

1:22:00.290 --> 1:22:01.625
Serge!

1:22:05.087 --> 1:22:06.797
Your car's beautiful!

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:10.592
A Continental Blue Lincoln.
just like Delon's.

1:22:10.676 --> 1:22:15.681
A big car is good.
That way, we can fit Kate's things in.

1:22:15.764 --> 1:22:19.935
You're not filming?
Let's take a drive... no, a walk.

1:22:20.018 --> 1:22:22.563
Of course I'm filming.

1:22:22.646 --> 1:22:25.149
But there's no one to look after Kate.

1:22:25.232 --> 1:22:27.317
Serge, can you take her?

1:22:27.985 --> 1:22:30.487
— No, stay with me...
- I can't.

1:22:30.571 --> 1:22:32.865
It's important.
It's Alain Delon!

1:22:45.919 --> 1:22:47.671
What are we going to do?

1:22:55.929 --> 1:22:59.600
You know, I used to come here
when I was little.

1:23:05.647 --> 1:23:11.820
<i>Before turning on the gas
she thinks of her canary</i>

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:21.371
<i>Before putting an end
to this life for good</i>

1:23:24.082 --> 1:23:30.756
<i>She takes the cage
and goes out to the balcony</i>

1:23:33.425 --> 1:23:40.265
<i>The icy winter wind
chills her to the core</i>

1:23:40.349 --> 1:23:43.393
<i>Making her teeth chatter</i>

1:23:44.228 --> 1:23:46.480
Somethings not right.

1:23:46.897 --> 1:23:51.276
It's good.
Your fragility works beautifully.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.613
Sorry.
I wasn't talking about the song.

1:23:55.030 --> 1:23:57.074
I was looking at your clothes.

1:23:57.741 --> 1:23:59.201
They're no good.

1:23:59.284 --> 1:24:00.410
What?

1:24:01.119 --> 1:24:05.165
Maybe you could dress
a bit more casually.

1:24:05.249 --> 1:24:07.042
Open your shirt...

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:09.503
Grow your hair longer...

1:24:09.586 --> 1:24:11.755
Try not shaving...

1:24:15.217 --> 1:24:16.927
Have I upset you?

1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:23.100
A little Brit, teaching me elegance?

1:24:25.769 --> 1:24:27.729
Let's get back to the song.

1:24:31.942 --> 1:24:33.527
<i>As over...</i>

1:24:33.610 --> 1:24:38.073
<i>London night slowly falls</i>

1:24:39.950 --> 1:24:43.745
Hey, stay in the box!
Don't come out yet!

1:24:43.829 --> 1:24:45.747
What's that?

1:24:46.665 --> 1:24:48.584
Meet your new sweetie.

1:24:48.667 --> 1:24:50.294
A surprise for you.

1:24:51.962 --> 1:24:53.463
Your name's Sweetie?

1:26:08.955 --> 1:26:11.333
What the hell's going on?

1:26:12.042 --> 1:26:13.543
I'm sorry?

1:26:15.253 --> 1:26:18.090
Didn't you want to be a Pygmalion?

1:26:18.882 --> 1:26:21.718
Take a girl and shape her?

1:26:21.802 --> 1:26:24.096
You're doing the exact opposite.

1:26:24.179 --> 1:26:27.474
Miss England tells you how to dress,

1:26:27.557 --> 1:26:30.394
how to wear your hair...

1:26:30.477 --> 1:26:33.522
And you obey like a toy poodle.

1:26:33.605 --> 1:26:37.651
A poodle that chooses its master.
I don't need you anymore.

1:26:37.734 --> 1:26:39.736
Get lost.

1:26:39.820 --> 1:26:42.364
You're dumping me? Are you crazy?

1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:44.908
Far from it.

1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:50.205
And never come back!

1:26:52.916 --> 1:26:54.668
What did you say?

1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:57.295
I like my new mug.

1:26:58.130 --> 1:26:59.756
You see.

1:27:07.764 --> 1:27:09.057
Serge...

1:27:10.100 --> 1:27:12.894
What's new in London? Still raining?

1:27:14.813 --> 1:27:16.481
Sit down.

1:27:17.524 --> 1:27:19.025
Listen to this.

1:27:40.464 --> 1:27:42.090
<i>I love you</i>

1:27:46.678 --> 1:27:48.221
<i>Me neither</i>

1:27:51.808 --> 1:27:53.643
<i>Oh, my love</i>

1:27:55.187 --> 1:27:59.441
<i>You're the unbroken wave</i>

1:28:04.321 --> 1:28:07.032
<i>I go and come</i>

1:28:10.619 --> 1:28:13.580
<i>Between your loins</i>

1:28:22.422 --> 1:28:25.926
<i>And I hold myself back</i>

1:28:31.807 --> 1:28:33.642
If we release that...

1:28:34.851 --> 1:28:36.686
we'll end up in jail.

1:28:36.770 --> 1:28:40.565
Me as the publisher
and you as the writer.

1:28:40.649 --> 1:28:44.027
I'm willing to risk prison,
but not for one song.

1:28:44.110 --> 1:28:46.238
So here's what you'll do.

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:50.033
Take your umbrella, go back to London

1:28:50.116 --> 1:28:53.745
and record another ten songs
like that one.

1:28:53.829 --> 1:28:56.540
You have to release that one first.

1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:01.253
Ok, but it'll be a huge scandal.

1:29:02.796 --> 1:29:04.297
Maybe.

1:29:05.006 --> 1:29:08.385
It's going to be one hell of a scandal!

1:29:17.269 --> 1:29:21.731
Right, kid, I'd like to move on
to more serious things now.

1:29:22.607 --> 1:29:24.985
Your big album?

1:29:25.068 --> 1:29:27.529
That symphonic project of yours?

1:29:29.072 --> 1:29:31.449
I'd like to marry a British lady.

1:29:33.285 --> 1:29:34.953
Is she pretty?

1:29:36.746 --> 1:29:38.498
Not bad.

1:29:38.582 --> 1:29:40.709
Does she look like me?

1:29:41.585 --> 1:29:43.295
No, not at all.

1:29:47.883 --> 1:29:49.342
Sergio...

1:29:50.302 --> 1:29:51.595
<i>You know...</i>

1:29:52.304 --> 1:29:54.347
We could have a baby.

1:31:03.708 --> 1:31:04.918
Yes, I agree.

1:31:05.001 --> 1:31:06.962
I agree, it's perfect.

1:31:14.177 --> 1:31:16.137
What's your name?

1:31:16.721 --> 1:31:18.515
Melody.

1:31:18.598 --> 1:31:20.517
Melody Nelson.

1:31:35.281 --> 1:31:37.075
Lucky you could call us.

1:31:37.826 --> 1:31:39.202
Who's your doctor?

1:31:39.786 --> 1:31:41.663
The American Hospital...

1:31:44.249 --> 1:31:47.252
What's that filthy rag?

1:31:47.335 --> 1:31:50.505
There's a Hermès blanket on my bed.
Go and fetch it.

1:31:50.588 --> 1:31:52.465
On the stretcher now.

1:31:52.549 --> 1:31:54.968
No, I'm not lying on that.

1:31:55.051 --> 1:31:58.013
If I leave lying down,
I won't come back alive.

1:31:58.096 --> 1:32:02.225
My job is to get you to the hospital
in one piece.

1:32:03.268 --> 1:32:06.396
Ole, but I want to walk out
of my home.

1:32:07.022 --> 1:32:08.898
Shit, I'm the one paying!

1:32:31.796 --> 1:32:33.339
You asshole!

1:32:34.716 --> 1:32:38.428
My little chicken...
I scared you, huh?

1:32:43.016 --> 1:32:44.684
They said it's benign.

1:32:44.768 --> 1:32:47.187
Quit smoking and messing around.

1:32:47.270 --> 1:32:48.855
Does the press know?

1:32:48.938 --> 1:32:50.315
We kept it quiet.

1:32:50.398 --> 1:32:54.277
Why get sick if no one can pity me?
Pass me the phone.

1:32:58.073 --> 1:32:59.783
<i>France Soir, phase.</i>

1:33:01.117 --> 1:33:03.870
Here's a scoop.
Serge Gainsbourg has had a coronary.

1:33:03.953 --> 1:33:06.498
He nearly died but he's over it.

1:33:06.581 --> 1:33:09.209
He's working on a hot new album.

1:33:11.252 --> 1:33:12.754
Feeling better?

1:33:13.296 --> 1:33:15.256
Get me some cigarettes.

1:33:15.799 --> 1:33:17.217
No.

1:33:24.265 --> 1:33:26.726
Get your mug out of here.

1:33:28.311 --> 1:33:31.314
It's time to smoke the pipe of peace.

1:33:45.411 --> 1:33:47.288
Let's split.

1:33:47.372 --> 1:33:50.250
- Come on, pack. Let's go!
- No way.

1:33:50.333 --> 1:33:53.336
Photographers are coming tomorrow.

1:33:54.129 --> 1:33:55.964
Why didn't you say so?

1:33:56.756 --> 1:33:59.509
I don't want to miss that either.

1:33:59.592 --> 1:34:03.012
The martyrdom of Saint Sebastian!

1:34:03.555 --> 1:34:06.182
Flashbulbs instead of arrows...

1:34:07.517 --> 1:34:10.728
You had a close call.
How will you get over it?

1:34:11.354 --> 1:34:16.067
I plan to step up my intake
of alcohol...

1:34:17.026 --> 1:34:18.570
and cigarettes.

1:34:22.115 --> 1:34:23.867
The greatest singer in the world.

1:34:26.369 --> 1:34:29.831
<i>Monseigneur, the solar star</i>

1:34:29.914 --> 1:34:32.625
<i>Since I don't admire him a lot</i>

1:34:33.543 --> 1:34:36.880
<i>Turns his light off me
but I care not</i>

1:34:36.963 --> 1:34:39.757
<i>My rendezvous is with you</i>

1:34:40.550 --> 1:34:44.095
<i>The light that I prefer</i>

1:34:44.179 --> 1:34:46.890
<i>Is that of your jealous eyes</i>

1:34:47.724 --> 1:34:50.852
<i>Nothing else matters to me</i>

1:34:51.311 --> 1:34:53.980
<i>My rendezvous is with you</i>

1:34:54.772 --> 1:34:58.276
<i>Monsieur, my landlord</i>

1:34:58.359 --> 1:35:01.070
<i>Since I wreck everything</i>

1:35:01.613 --> 1:35:05.033
<i>Has thrown me out
but I care not</i>

1:35:05.533 --> 1:35:08.411
<i>My rendezvous is with you</i>

1:36:26.447 --> 1:36:29.826
Serge, we're running late.

1:36:29.909 --> 1:36:32.161
Do your whining on stage.

1:36:39.627 --> 1:36:42.297
Want to get yourself run over?

1:36:42.380 --> 1:36:44.007
I'm waiting for a taxi!

1:36:47.844 --> 1:36:49.262
Hi, guys.

1:36:49.345 --> 1:36:51.306
Why are you lying there?

1:36:51.389 --> 1:36:53.516
I'm on stage in 30 minutes.

1:36:54.684 --> 1:36:57.562
I don't know how to get there.
I sold my Rolls.

1:36:58.521 --> 1:37:01.399
All that's left is the radiator cap.

1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:09.866
Give me a police badge.

1:37:23.504 --> 1:37:24.839
Use the siren!

1:37:52.408 --> 1:37:54.911
<i>Cover your blond curls, guys</i>

1:37:55.745 --> 1:37:58.289
<i>Slick them back with gel and grease</i>

1:37:58.831 --> 1:37:59.832
<i>Let's dance the...</i>

1:37:59.916 --> 1:38:01.459
<i>Nazi rock</i>

1:38:04.921 --> 1:38:06.631
<i>Let's dance the...</i>

1:38:29.445 --> 1:38:30.571
Lucien,

1:38:31.614 --> 1:38:34.450
even the girls cried less
over the dog.

1:38:35.451 --> 1:38:38.621
You didn't cry this much
when your poor father died.

1:38:44.544 --> 1:38:46.462
Pull yourself together.

1:38:49.215 --> 1:38:50.466
Look at me.

1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:52.969
Comb your hair.

1:38:55.138 --> 1:38:58.349
You want little Charlotte
to see you in this state?

1:38:58.433 --> 1:39:01.477
They're used to seeing me whine.

1:39:02.019 --> 1:39:04.981
Why didn't you ever
get your ears fixed?

1:39:12.864 --> 1:39:17.660
Hey, Gainsbarre, he looks like us, huh?
The cabbage.

1:39:19.745 --> 1:39:22.999
I'm the cabbage head man.

1:39:23.416 --> 1:39:26.377
Half vegetable, half guy.

1:40:52.755 --> 1:40:54.840
What are you doing up?

1:40:56.509 --> 1:40:57.635
And you?

1:40:59.262 --> 1:41:02.306
Put everything back where it belongs!

1:41:03.057 --> 1:41:05.393
Then get to bed. Shit!

1:41:06.394 --> 1:41:11.023
Next time, play in your own room.
This is my room here!

1:41:11.107 --> 1:41:13.776
Your things are disgusting and scary!

1:41:14.777 --> 1:41:20.700
You're scared of Professor Flipus?
Don't be, he's just paper.

1:41:20.783 --> 1:41:22.577
Why is he called Flipus?

1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:26.747
He looks like my brother
and he makes me flip out.

1:41:27.623 --> 1:41:29.542
You don't have a brother.

1:41:39.176 --> 1:41:42.847
Before I was born,
my morn had a little boy.

1:41:42.930 --> 1:41:45.391
He didn't last long.

1:41:45.474 --> 1:41:49.812
But, all my life, I've felt
he was watching me from his grave.

1:41:49.895 --> 1:41:52.315
He's watching us too.

1:41:52.398 --> 1:41:54.734
That's why I don't go to pee at night.

1:41:54.817 --> 1:41:57.069
So she pisses on the carpet.

1:41:57.153 --> 1:41:59.113
Not true!

1:41:59.196 --> 1:42:01.490
It's all right, chicken.

1:42:02.450 --> 1:42:05.911
You're a little snitch, aren't you?

1:42:13.544 --> 1:42:14.754
Check it out...

1:42:14.837 --> 1:42:16.213
Heart hat, Charlotte?

1:42:19.759 --> 1:42:21.636
What are you up to?

1:42:22.219 --> 1:42:24.847
Professor Flipus is sick.
We're operating.

1:42:25.514 --> 1:42:27.224
What's wrong with him?

1:42:27.308 --> 1:42:29.060
It's really bad. He's dead.

1:42:36.359 --> 1:42:38.819
Yeah, he's screwed.

1:42:38.903 --> 1:42:41.197
Let's put an end to his suffering.

1:42:53.876 --> 1:42:56.504
You're a total asshole...

1:42:56.587 --> 1:42:59.173
Calm down, chicken.

1:42:59.256 --> 1:43:01.217
Kate, Charlotte...

1:43:01.717 --> 1:43:02.760
Come here.

1:43:03.344 --> 1:43:06.222
Don't talk to me ever again!

1:43:41.298 --> 1:43:44.176
Take it easy, guys...

1:43:50.933 --> 1:43:52.643
<i>No, kiddo...</i>

1:45:07.176 --> 1:45:09.094
What's their problem?

1:45:09.178 --> 1:45:11.430
They wonder
what you want them to sing.

1:45:12.515 --> 1:45:15.726
It's best not to explain
the sexual songs.

1:45:15.810 --> 1:45:18.229
Why? Don't they fuck?

1:45:18.312 --> 1:45:20.356
Reggae's a serious thing.

1:45:20.439 --> 1:45:22.316
It's sacred music.

1:45:24.693 --> 1:45:27.696
Tell them we'll be singing
the French national anthem.

1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:31.158
How do I explain that?

1:46:12.908 --> 1:46:16.495
<i>Arise you children of our Motherland</i>

1:46:16.579 --> 1:46:19.498
<i>Oh now is here our glorious day</i>

1:46:20.124 --> 1:46:23.460
<i>Over us the bloodstained banner</i>

1:46:23.544 --> 1:46:26.755
<i>Of tyranny holds sway</i>

1:46:27.256 --> 1:46:30.009
<i>To arms, et cetera</i>

1:46:41.103 --> 1:46:44.690
<i>Oh do you hear there in our fields</i>

1:46:44.773 --> 1:46:48.193
<i>The roar of those fierce fighting men</i>

1:46:48.277 --> 1:46:51.238
<i>Who came right here into our midst</i>

1:46:51.780 --> 1:46:55.701
<i>To slaughter sons, wives and kin</i>

1:46:55.784 --> 1:46:58.120
<i>To arms, et cetera</i>

1:47:12.635 --> 1:47:16.347
<i>Into the fight we too shall enter</i>

1:47:16.430 --> 1:47:19.516
<i>When our fathers are dead and gone</i>

1:47:20.100 --> 1:47:23.604
<i>We shall find their bones laid down to rest</i>

1:47:23.687 --> 1:47:26.774
<i>With the fame of their glories won</i>

1:47:27.149 --> 1:47:29.193
<i>To arms, et cetera</i>

1:47:45.542 --> 1:47:47.002
Bastard!

1:47:53.550 --> 1:47:56.971
You shit on our national anthem!

1:48:26.041 --> 1:48:28.460
My jamaicans were...

1:48:29.211 --> 1:48:33.132
It's not their problem.
They come from Kingston.

1:48:33.841 --> 1:48:38.012
They were frightened
by the police deployment...

1:48:39.138 --> 1:48:41.682
and by the bomb scares!

1:48:43.225 --> 1:48:45.436
In every hotel in town!

1:48:46.186 --> 1:48:48.022
I'm a rebel!

1:48:49.648 --> 1:48:52.526
And <i>La</i> Marseillaise is a rebel's song!

1:48:54.486 --> 1:48:56.905
I'd like you to sing it with me.

1:48:57.531 --> 1:49:02.327
<i>Arise you children of our Motherland</i>

1:49:02.411 --> 1:49:05.956
<i>Oh now is here our glorious day</i>

<i>Of tyranny holds sway</i>

1:49:18.886 --> 1:49:23.223
<i>Oh do you hear there in our fields</i>

1:49:23.307 --> 1:49:27.728
<i>The roar of those fierce fighting men</i>

1:49:27.811 --> 1:49:31.857
<i>Who came right here into our midst</i>

1:49:31.940 --> 1:49:36.278
<i>To slaughter sons, wives and kin</i>

1:49:36.361 --> 1:49:40.032
<i>To arms, oh citizens</i>

1:49:40.115 --> 1:49:43.869
<i>Form up in serried ranks</i>

1:49:43.952 --> 1:49:48.373
<i>March on</i>

1:49:48.457 --> 1:49:52.002
<i>And drench our fields</i>

1:49:52.086 --> 1:49:56.131
<i>With their tainted blood</i>

1:50:08.185 --> 1:50:11.438
“With his parody of La Marseillaise

1:50:11.814 --> 1:50:15.067
<i>Gainsbourg thought he'd have a hit.</i>

1:50:15.943 --> 1:50:18.529
<i>When he looks in the mirror,</i>

1:50:18.612 --> 1:50:22.950
<i>Serge Gainsbourg must dream
of a society with his face.</i>

1:50:23.826 --> 1:50:25.410
<i>A gummy eye,</i>

1:50:25.494 --> 1:50:27.329
<i>three days of stubble,</i>

1:50:27.412 --> 1:50:29.123
<i>a droopy lower lip.</i>

1:50:29.957 --> 1:50:33.043
<i>When I see Serge Gainsbourg,</i>

1:50:33.127 --> 1:50:35.045
<i>I become an ecologist,</i>

1:50:35.129 --> 1:50:38.799
<i>fighting the pollution
his person and work give off,</i>

1:50:38.882 --> 1:50:41.510
<i>like certain exhaust pipes.</i>

1:50:42.302 --> 1:50:47.683
<i>The most difficult aspect
of this foul quagmire: anti-Semitism.</i>

1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:50.602
<i>The field has its propagators</i>

1:50:50.686 --> 1:50:54.898
<i>and also, unfortunately,
its agitators.</i>

1:50:55.357 --> 1:50:58.735
<i>Serge Gainsbourg stirs up
anti-Semitism.</i>

1:50:59.236 --> 1:51:02.573
<i>All that to keep the royalties
rolling in.”</i>

1:51:10.956 --> 1:51:13.333
Jane has left me.

1:51:14.918 --> 1:51:18.547
Little Charlotte
is living with her morn now.

1:51:20.549 --> 1:51:23.760
My mom is in the stars.

1:51:24.595 --> 1:51:26.305
And my dad...

1:51:27.055 --> 1:51:29.516
ls my dad proud of me?

1:51:30.225 --> 1:51:32.060
Hey, Gainsbarre.

1:51:38.317 --> 1:51:41.862
Jane left
because I screwed up too much.

1:52:19.775 --> 1:52:23.278
Mr. Gainsbourg
would like to buy you a drink.

1:52:25.405 --> 1:52:27.449
Screw that old jerk.

1:52:41.713 --> 1:52:45.342
The old jerk's here to see you,
you cow.

1:52:49.721 --> 1:52:53.141
I'm warning you, I'm a total wreck.

1:52:53.225 --> 1:52:55.352
You need a daddy?

1:52:55.435 --> 1:52:57.312
I want someone to save me.

1:53:02.317 --> 1:53:03.986
<i>That's life...</i>

1:53:09.449 --> 1:53:11.368
For God's sake!

1:53:11.451 --> 1:53:13.287
Stay here!

1:53:17.332 --> 1:53:19.209
You leave when I say so.

1:53:23.588 --> 1:53:26.091
You match my aesthetic criteria.

1:53:27.217 --> 1:53:28.969
Diaphanous beauty

1:53:29.594 --> 1:53:33.140
with the despair of a tragic character.

1:53:39.563 --> 1:53:41.440
Understand what I mean?

1:53:41.523 --> 1:53:43.191
You want to screw me?

1:53:45.861 --> 1:53:47.362
Maybe.

1:53:50.282 --> 1:53:53.201
But I'm saying it more poetically.

1:53:58.498 --> 1:54:02.753
In any case, you're so plastered
you won't hurt me much.

1:54:03.587 --> 1:54:05.088
Actually...

1:54:08.216 --> 1:54:12.387
On a horizontal level,
I've never had any complaints yet.

1:54:20.395 --> 1:54:24.024

1:54:48.382 --> 1:54:50.258
It's a high price.

1:54:51.343 --> 1:54:53.428
I was ready to bankrupt myself.

1:55:01.686 --> 1:55:03.897
I wanted a daughter.

1:55:14.116 --> 1:55:16.952
Still, you look like your morn.
That's better.

1:55:20.288 --> 1:55:22.124
Let's give you your dad's name.

1:55:22.791 --> 1:55:23.875
King Serge?

1:55:23.959 --> 1:55:28.630
No, Lucien. Lucien ll,
destined to rule France like his dad.

1:55:29.131 --> 1:55:32.050
And Navarre too.
Let's not forget Navarre.

1:55:32.134 --> 1:55:35.554
<i>The sun is rare</i>

1:55:35.637 --> 1:55:38.849
<i>And happiness too</i>

1:55:38.932 --> 1:55:43.478
<i>Love goes astray throughout life</i>

1:55:45.313 --> 1:55:48.400
<i>The sun is rare</i>

1:55:48.483 --> 1:55:51.570
<i>And happiness too</i>

1:55:51.653 --> 1:55:56.867
<i>But everything moves in Melody's arms</i>

1:55:57.784 --> 1:56:00.537
<i>The walls</i>

1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:02.873
<i>Of the labyrinth</i>

1:56:02.956 --> 1:56:07.878
<i>Open up to the infinite</i>

1:56:56.218 --> 1:57:00.847
“Gainsbourg transcends reality.
I much prefer his lies to his truths.”
