01:25.928 --> 01:27.729
<i>This is the formation zone</i>

01:27.762 --> 01:30.832
<i>for tropical storm Hazel.
Now, we've got two models.</i>

01:30.865 --> 01:33.202
<i>The American model
has Hazel turning north,</i>

01:33.235 --> 01:35.670
<i>over Mobile
and the Florida Panhandle</i>

01:35.704 --> 01:36.738
<i>and into Georgia.</i>

01:37.173 --> 01:38.707
<i>The European model</i>

01:38.740 --> 01:40.742
<i>has her slowing down, heading
northwest,</i>

01:40.775 --> 01:43.913
<i>gaining strength and becoming
a potential hurricane.</i>

01:44.146 --> 01:47.582
<i>This could become a major storm
and hit land again anywhere</i>

01:47.615 --> 01:49.517
<i>from Gulfport to New Orleans.</i>

01:49.919 --> 01:51.519
<i>Hazel is moving at
approximately</i>

01:51.553 --> 01:52.821
<i>ten miles per hour</i>

01:53.022 --> 01:54.823
<i>and should make landfall
late tonight</i>

01:54.856 --> 01:56.258
<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

01:56.292 --> 01:58.294
<i>As Hazel makes landfall,
she's gonna become</i>

01:58.327 --> 02:01.529
<i>a tropical storm once again
and bring plenty of rain</i>

02:01.563 --> 02:03.265
<i>and high winds
to wherever she hits.</i>

02:03.498 --> 02:06.868
<i>Now, folks, I feel that Hazel
is most likely to head towards</i>

02:06.902 --> 02:09.038
<i>our friends in Louisiana.</i>

02:17.079 --> 02:18.080
Gorgeous.

02:22.751 --> 02:23.953
What's in there?

02:23.986 --> 02:25.221
- In that?
- Yeah.

02:25.454 --> 02:27.089
- Nothing.
- Define nothing.

02:27.957 --> 02:28.891
Soft shells.

02:29.591 --> 02:32.061
- I thought the molt was over.
- It was. And then it wasn't.

02:32.328 --> 02:33.528
But those are for Fryman's.

02:34.463 --> 02:36.899
What, so they can be drowned
in garlic and black pepper?

02:36.932 --> 02:38.067
You can't even taste them!

02:38.100 --> 02:39.768
They offered 55 a dozen.

02:40.169 --> 02:41.137
I'll give you 60.

02:41.803 --> 02:43.305
Tucker gonna be okay with that?

02:43.339 --> 02:44.839
Are you kidding?
He'll be thrilled.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.308
Soft-shells this late?

02:48.676 --> 02:50.845
If anyone asks,
you didn't get those from me.

02:51.113 --> 02:53.015
Get what?

02:54.616 --> 02:55.918
- Careful out there this weekend.
- Thanks.

03:08.931 --> 03:10.066
Thank you.

03:10.099 --> 03:12.068
Seventeen?
Seventeen right here.

03:12.101 --> 03:14.036
Hi, this is Miranda Wells again.

03:14.437 --> 03:17.139
I got an overdraft fee
of $80 on the third.

03:17.173 --> 03:19.607
But if the check had gone
through like it was supposed to,

03:19.641 --> 03:21.043
everything would've been fine.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.844
So, that fee
needs to be removed,

03:22.878 --> 03:24.779
refunded, rescinded or whatever.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.016
Please call back me today,
if possible.

03:27.049 --> 03:28.217
Thank you.

03:29.185 --> 03:31.353
- Miranda, it's 12:13.
- So?

03:31.387 --> 03:32.922
So you told me
to remind you about

03:32.955 --> 03:34.990
a dentist appointment at noon.
I forgot.

03:39.694 --> 03:41.063
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:41.097 --> 03:43.065
Up five percent
from last year.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.168
People are spending again,
thank God.

03:46.202 --> 03:48.837
- Where are you off to?
- Uh, a dentist appointment.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.306
Oh, listen, um,

03:50.339 --> 03:52.308
- about dinner.
- Oh, I know. With the storm.

03:52.341 --> 03:53.876
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

03:53.909 --> 03:55.945
The weather guy
says it's gonna miss us, but...

03:55.978 --> 03:58.414
- You can never be too careful.
- So you think I should?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.349
What? Board up?
Absolutely.

04:00.382 --> 04:01.884
Look, no matter
how bad things are,

04:01.917 --> 04:03.886
- they can always get worse.
- Oh.

04:04.220 --> 04:06.122
And here I actually got us
in to Shaya.

04:06.388 --> 04:08.891
Oh, babe. It's a school night.

04:09.325 --> 04:10.326
Thank you.

04:11.093 --> 04:12.161
We're fine.

04:12.895 --> 04:14.396
Oh! And, um...

04:14.829 --> 04:16.365
I bought soft-shells from Sang,

04:16.398 --> 04:18.033
who was going to sell them
to Fryman's,

04:18.067 --> 04:20.002
which I said was bogus,
because their chef sucks,

04:20.035 --> 04:21.836
which is why I paid 60 a dozen.

04:22.371 --> 04:24.373
Soft shells this late
in the season?

04:24.406 --> 04:26.375
- Right?
- That's my girl.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.743
Bye.

04:43.025 --> 04:44.360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.739
Hi. Sorry.
Can I help you?

04:57.772 --> 04:58.641
Well, I hope so.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.876
I made a reservation
on Hotel Tonight.

05:03.045 --> 05:04.413
I've got a cousin in Nashville.

05:04.446 --> 05:05.948
Oh, is that so?

05:05.981 --> 05:07.349
Is this your first time
staying with us?

05:07.383 --> 05:09.018
Uh, first time in New Orleans.

05:11.253 --> 05:12.321
What are you studying?

05:14.323 --> 05:16.392
How to get out
from behind this desk.

05:17.426 --> 05:21.397
Well, anything is possible
if you really want it.

05:22.231 --> 05:23.399
Yeah, I guess.

05:23.765 --> 05:26.001
Any chance you have a room
with a view?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.570
No, sorry.

05:27.603 --> 05:30.072
All of the rooms overlooking
the Quarter are fully booked.

05:30.272 --> 05:32.241
No problem.
I'll take whatever I can get.

05:32.908 --> 05:36.312
Room 1 checked out early,
on account of the storm.

05:37.845 --> 05:39.448
Okay, that's so weird.

05:39.481 --> 05:41.483
Room 1 has a view
all the way to the river.

05:41.816 --> 05:43.285
Must be my lucky day.

05:46.788 --> 05:48.357
It's not often I get
a grown up in here

05:48.390 --> 05:49.491
with a cavity this bad.

05:49.525 --> 05:51.093
What do you do,
gargle with sugar?

05:51.126 --> 05:51.927
Uh...

05:52.294 --> 05:55.730
- Saltwater taffy.
- Yep, that would do it.

05:57.299 --> 05:59.001
Devon says I need a root canal.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.270
Well, I think he just misses
your company.

06:01.604 --> 06:04.240
Mm, how about a week
from Monday at 9:00?

06:04.707 --> 06:07.476
Donna, you're not helping.
Don't you have anything, like...

06:08.143 --> 06:09.511
next June?

06:09.545 --> 06:11.914
Who's your provider again?

06:11.947 --> 06:13.215
I opted out.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.985
Um, why?
How much is it out of pocket?

06:16.018 --> 06:19.221
That's 1,700 for a front,
2,300 for a back.

06:19.455 --> 06:22.324
- Is it a front or a back?
- Uh, back.

06:23.959 --> 06:26.061
Well, I'm sure Tucker
wouldn't mind plunking down

06:26.095 --> 06:27.363
that platinum card of his.

06:27.795 --> 06:29.465
That may be so,
but things are...

06:29.999 --> 06:32.901
complicated enough what
with him being my boss and all.

06:33.902 --> 06:37.805
Look, just stay safe tonight.
Okay? I hear Hazel's gonna turn.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.909
I bet she hangs a left
and pounds us straight on.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.878
Oh! Nice cast!

07:50.245 --> 07:52.881
I, uh...
I'm looking for Miranda Wells.

07:53.248 --> 07:54.416
You from the bank?

07:54.917 --> 07:57.119
Can't say that I am. No.

07:57.386 --> 07:58.554
She's at work right now.

07:58.587 --> 08:00.356
You can leave it with me.
I'm her son.

08:01.423 --> 08:02.925
I kinda figured that.

08:04.393 --> 08:06.128
Well, the thing is...

08:07.629 --> 08:10.566
I'm afraid this comes with
a little bit of an explanation.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.569
Any idea what time
she'll be home?

08:13.769 --> 08:15.304
Usually around four.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.639
That's a cool thing
you've got there.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.509
My dad made it for me,
'cause I wasn't getting my line

08:20.542 --> 08:22.044
to where the big ones
are hiding.

08:22.611 --> 08:25.080
He was an inventor.
Sort of.

08:25.514 --> 08:26.648
Pretty good one, I bet.

08:27.116 --> 08:28.951
Well, my mom says
he never sold much,

08:28.984 --> 08:31.553
but that's 'cause
it wasn't his real job.

08:31.587 --> 08:34.056
But he sure solved
your casting problem, didn't he?

08:35.157 --> 08:36.491
Fish don't seem too impressed.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.230
- No school today?
- I have a cold,

08:41.263 --> 08:44.133
but my mom gave me
purple Dimetapp, so it's okay.

08:44.166 --> 08:47.202
Well, you chose a beautiful day
to stay home.

08:47.236 --> 08:50.072
Yeah. The storm's not supposed
to hit us until tonight.

08:50.372 --> 08:52.941
I checked.
A couple times.

08:55.177 --> 08:56.412
Thanks for the help.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.549
Oh, and when you see her,
don't tell her we spoke.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.318
I'm not supposed
to talk to strangers.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.655
Your secret's safe with me.

09:33.215 --> 09:35.150
<i>There is a chance that Hazel</i>

09:35.184 --> 09:37.152
<i>will become a hurricane
before it makes landfall</i>

09:37.186 --> 09:40.322
<i>somewhere between Pensacola
and Morgan City, Louisiana.</i>

09:40.355 --> 09:42.658
<i>Even if Hazel never develops
into a hurricane,</i>

09:42.858 --> 09:45.327
<i>she will be bringing high winds
and tons of rain</i>

09:45.360 --> 09:47.095
- <i>to the Gulf Coast.</i>
- Great.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.198
<i>Hurricane warnings
are off the...</i>

10:32.808 --> 10:33.509
Hi.

10:34.076 --> 10:37.045
- <i>Miranda, it's Bobby.</i>
- I know. I have Caller ID,

10:37.079 --> 10:38.614
and I can see your face,
sort of.

10:38.647 --> 10:40.582
<i>Well, are you listening
to the news?</i>

10:40.782 --> 10:42.651
About the storm?
No. What?

10:42.684 --> 10:45.120
<i>They're only gonna
get worse with climate change.</i>

10:45.153 --> 10:47.389
I blame cows.

10:48.457 --> 10:50.192
- <i>How is your roof?</i>
- My roof?

10:50.626 --> 10:52.661
<i>The leaks.
Did you get 'em fixed?</i>

10:52.694 --> 10:54.596
Bobby,
I can't afford a root canal,

10:54.630 --> 10:56.231
let alone a new roof.

10:56.265 --> 10:58.100
<i>You need to sell that damn
place</i>

10:58.133 --> 11:00.068
<i>and move to higher ground.</i>

11:00.102 --> 11:02.170
- So you've said.
- <i>Oh, did I?</i>

11:02.204 --> 11:03.338
Ever since he died.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.340
<i>And it's as true today
as it was then.</i>

11:05.374 --> 11:07.175
<i>It is not safe.</i>

11:10.279 --> 11:12.080
Look, Bobby, um, I gotta run.

11:12.114 --> 11:14.182
- I'll call you later?
- <i>Well, you never do.</i>

11:14.216 --> 11:16.251
<i>You're always so busy.</i>

11:16.285 --> 11:18.186
It's busy with the kids.
Love you.

11:21.523 --> 11:23.492
Hey, gang.
How was the day?

11:23.859 --> 11:24.760
Awful.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.395
Terrible.

11:26.628 --> 11:28.063
Bessie, honey, what's wrong?

11:28.430 --> 11:30.232
She told some kid
she has a pony.

11:30.265 --> 11:32.200
They called her a liar,
which she is.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.202
I said I wanted a pony.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.337
Since when?

11:35.370 --> 11:36.471
Since always!

11:36.505 --> 11:38.807
I told you not to let
her watch <i>Black Stallion.</i>

11:46.248 --> 11:47.649
You didn't eat your lunch?

11:47.683 --> 11:49.351
Nobody brown bags anymore.

11:49.651 --> 11:51.286
Why can't I just buy food
at school?

11:51.587 --> 11:53.755
You can every once in a while,
but it adds up.

11:53.789 --> 11:55.657
- We've been over this.
- So stupid.

11:57.225 --> 11:59.728
Okay. Talk to me.
What's going on? Hmm?

12:02.564 --> 12:05.400
Kit Riley's having a party
the same night as me.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.536
They're gonna have freaking
food trucks.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.305
Wow.

12:11.173 --> 12:13.408
I don't even want a birthday.
I'm never gonna get

12:13.442 --> 12:15.177
what I want anyway,
so what's the point?

12:15.210 --> 12:17.312
Okay. We can't afford
a computer right now,

12:17.346 --> 12:18.714
but it might be something
for Christmas.

12:18.915 --> 12:21.283
Right.
We'll be lucky to have a tree.

12:24.753 --> 12:26.555
You're not supposed to be
on the phone while...

12:26.588 --> 12:28.490
I wasn't gonna answer it,
I just wanna see who it was.

12:28.523 --> 12:29.725
I'm expecting a call
from the bank.

12:29.758 --> 12:30.459
It says Carol.

12:30.692 --> 12:31.627
- That's the bank.
- Oh, my God.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.528
You're on a first name basis
with the bank?

12:33.562 --> 12:35.330
- Stop being so dramatic.
- This is why I don't want

12:35.364 --> 12:36.899
- a party, we can't afford it!
- Ask if I can call her back.

12:36.933 --> 12:37.866
Please?

12:38.667 --> 12:39.902
Oh, my God, Mom!

12:40.669 --> 12:43.538
You're, like, the worst driver
in the whole world.

12:43.572 --> 12:45.807
That's because no one else
in the entire world

12:45.841 --> 12:47.509
has you as a passenger.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.549
I am so sorry.
It was totally my fault.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.251
Are you okay?
Are your kids okay?

12:56.284 --> 12:57.819
Other than needing
an attitude adjustment,

12:57.853 --> 12:58.787
they're fine.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.224
Well, looks like
you got the brunt of it.

13:07.596 --> 13:08.830
There goes my deductible.

13:13.235 --> 13:14.403
Hey, hey.

13:14.436 --> 13:16.738
Don't waste your insurance
on this.

13:17.406 --> 13:20.342
If you just have a little
duct tape and spray foam,

13:20.375 --> 13:21.476
I can fix this.

13:21.944 --> 13:23.545
I can't ask you to do that.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.281
You didn't. I offered.

13:29.018 --> 13:30.419
My dad was a mechanic.

13:30.953 --> 13:33.622
Hey. Whatever you want.
Totally up to you.

13:38.027 --> 13:41.196
Well... I mean,
we're just up the road.

13:41.563 --> 13:42.698
I'll follow you.

13:42.932 --> 13:44.266
Thanks.

13:44.299 --> 13:45.467
I got it. I got it.

13:50.605 --> 13:53.675
- He's not gonna sue us, is he?
- Nope.

13:54.242 --> 13:55.577
Why is he taking our bumper?

13:55.878 --> 13:57.579
Because he's offered
to come over to fix it.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.248
You're letting him
follow us home?

14:38.720 --> 14:40.689
Bessie,
don't forget your backpack.

14:40.722 --> 14:41.958
Okay, Mommy.

14:47.997 --> 14:51.299
You know, I realize I never got
a chance to introduce myself.

14:51.901 --> 14:54.036
- Bray Johnson.
- Miranda Wells.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.838
- Miranda, nice to meet you.
- Yeah. No, not really,

14:56.872 --> 14:58.607
but I appreciate the gesture.

14:59.108 --> 15:01.878
This is Missy and Bessie.

15:02.145 --> 15:04.746
- Hi, guys.
- What's the "V" stand for?

15:04.780 --> 15:06.782
The "V"?
Oh, uh, Vanderbilt.

15:06.815 --> 15:08.951
I teach engineering up there.

15:08.985 --> 15:10.318
Cool.

15:11.686 --> 15:13.755
So, you've got
your hands full, huh?

15:13.789 --> 15:15.992
Oh, you have no idea.
And that's Greg.

15:18.127 --> 15:19.761
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Greg.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.000
Hey. Uh, Mom?
What happened to the bumper?

15:24.699 --> 15:25.700
Karma.

15:26.202 --> 15:28.570
But Mr. Johnson here
says he can fix it.

15:28.603 --> 15:30.940
Yeah, you wouldn't happen
to have a few screwdrivers

15:30.973 --> 15:33.475
and some wrenches
in your tool shed, would you?

15:34.177 --> 15:36.645
- Of course.
- And how about some spray foam?

15:36.678 --> 15:39.614
You know, the kind you use
to fill a hole or stop a leak?

15:39.648 --> 15:41.416
Tiger Foam or Great Stuff?

15:42.051 --> 15:43.385
Either will do.

15:45.854 --> 15:47.389
Tiger what or Great what?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.524
Shop talk.

15:50.993 --> 15:54.596
Do you want a beer
or a water or a juice box?

15:54.629 --> 15:57.033
Nah, this'll just take a second.

15:57.066 --> 15:59.001
Okay, well,
I'll leave my door open.

15:59.035 --> 16:00.903
If you need anything,
just holler.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.669
Hey, Mom.
Check it out.

16:41.576 --> 16:44.446
There. See? The last honest man.

16:44.479 --> 16:45.982
Now, can you turn on
the Weather Channel

16:46.015 --> 16:47.515
and set the table?

16:56.092 --> 16:58.160
<i>...Pensacola
and Morgan City, Louisiana.</i>

16:58.194 --> 17:01.163
<i>So, hurricane warnings
are up as Hazel becomes</i>

17:01.197 --> 17:03.698
<i>a Category 1 hurricane
later tonight</i>

17:03.732 --> 17:06.768
<i>or early tomorrow morning,
coming onshore somewhere there</i>

17:06.800 --> 17:09.503
<i>between Mobile, New Orleans,
and Pensacola...</i>

17:09.537 --> 17:11.473
Bessie?
Let's not color on the table.

17:11.506 --> 17:13.575
Okay? And can you please
take out the garbage?

17:13.608 --> 17:14.608
Okay, Mommy.

17:16.145 --> 17:19.015
What's for dinner?
Wait. Let me guess.

17:21.017 --> 17:23.585
Red beans and rice
or microwaved chicken nuggets

17:23.617 --> 17:24.519
and a salad.

17:25.154 --> 17:27.521
What would you prefer?
Lobster tails?

17:27.555 --> 17:28.757
Wouldn't you?

17:29.392 --> 17:32.128
- I want pizza.
- Not tonight, honey.

17:40.669 --> 17:42.138
Missy? Come here.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.074
Greg is in geek heaven.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.180
What do you expect? The poor kid
is surrounded by girls.

17:52.048 --> 17:53.950
How much are you paying
this guy anyway?

17:55.284 --> 17:56.484
Nothing.

18:02.857 --> 18:05.694
You gotta admit. You coming
out here looking for her,

18:05.727 --> 18:08.697
then she runs into you?
That's pretty weird.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.101
- Is it?
- Yeah.

18:12.335 --> 18:15.071
Because, you know,
what are the odds?

18:17.940 --> 18:19.808
Or maybe she's just
a lousy driver.

18:25.247 --> 18:27.615
Uh-oh. Here comes Hazel.

18:32.854 --> 18:34.123
Hey, how's it going?

18:34.656 --> 18:37.193
Well, it's good,
if you let this dry.

18:37.559 --> 18:39.561
It'll outlast the apocalypse.

18:39.594 --> 18:42.231
Okay, why don't you come inside,
wash your hands?

18:43.299 --> 18:44.833
Much obliged.

18:47.736 --> 18:48.938
Greg, come on!

18:55.111 --> 18:57.113
I don't want you
missing anymore school.

18:59.949 --> 19:02.018
Uh, you'll have
to excuse the mess.

19:02.251 --> 19:04.753
I wasn't expecting company
as you can probably tell.

19:04.786 --> 19:06.654
The paper towels and dish soap
are right there.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.258
And the beer in the fridge
has your name on it.

19:09.291 --> 19:12.527
- Oh, thank you.
- Mom, Bray's a professor.

19:12.794 --> 19:15.131
I heard.
Uh, what brings you down here?

19:16.265 --> 19:17.866
Well, it's, uh...

19:18.968 --> 19:20.668
kind of a long story, actually.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.173
Oh. I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

19:24.407 --> 19:26.942
No, no,
I don't mean it like that.

19:30.246 --> 19:32.547
- Mom!
- What?

19:32.814 --> 19:34.150
You put the chicken
in the microwave

19:34.350 --> 19:36.618
still in the bag,
and now it's all melted.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.853
Yes, I sure did.

19:40.755 --> 19:42.624
I guess it is red beans tonight.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.161
- Pizza!
- Yeah!

19:45.194 --> 19:49.697
Guys, that's not gonna happen.
Poor people can't afford pizza.

19:50.533 --> 19:53.202
We're not poor. We're broke.
There's a difference.

19:54.236 --> 19:55.637
You were saying?

20:01.277 --> 20:02.378
One second.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.711
Guys?

20:06.681 --> 20:08.250
Nice, huh?
It's our little version

20:08.284 --> 20:10.685
of <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>
With pots.

20:22.864 --> 20:24.266
Wind scares me.

20:26.734 --> 20:28.404
Well, nature can be
very powerful,

20:28.437 --> 20:31.639
- but so are you.
- Me? No way.

20:31.673 --> 20:33.242
Oh, yes, you are.

20:33.675 --> 20:37.046
But we have to be careful...

20:39.048 --> 20:41.083
because we get what we expect.

20:41.783 --> 20:44.819
- Mommy? Is that true?
- What, honey?

20:45.787 --> 20:46.889
What do you call this?

20:47.856 --> 20:49.624
A crab riding a bike?

20:51.026 --> 20:52.027
What else?

20:52.895 --> 20:53.896
A magnet.

20:54.363 --> 20:56.999
Which attracts things

20:57.399 --> 21:01.703
with a force
that you cannot see,

21:02.071 --> 21:05.040
but is definitely real.

21:06.408 --> 21:09.211
Your thoughts work the same way.

21:09.711 --> 21:12.014
The more you think
about something,

21:12.047 --> 21:14.049
the more you draw it to you.

21:14.550 --> 21:18.853
Okay. So, this is me
thinking about pizza.

21:19.088 --> 21:20.956
Are you really being serious
right now?

21:21.457 --> 21:25.094
I like when the cheese
is all melted and gooey.

21:25.127 --> 21:27.029
Mm. And what about you?

21:27.263 --> 21:30.099
- Pepperoni and sausage.
- Oh. And stuffed crust.

21:30.132 --> 21:32.368
That's what makes it.

21:40.842 --> 21:44.880
Okay. I've got a medium cheese
and medium pepperoni

21:44.914 --> 21:47.316
with stuffed crust
for Miranda Wells.

21:48.816 --> 21:49.919
Did you do this?

21:51.086 --> 21:52.188
Don't look at me.

21:55.191 --> 21:59.228
You got the right name,
but we did not order those.

21:59.261 --> 22:00.828
A guy named Tucker called it in.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.464
He even left a tip
'cause of the storm.

22:03.098 --> 22:05.301
That was so nice.
Thank you.

22:05.501 --> 22:07.236
- Stay dry.
- You too.

22:07.802 --> 22:08.803
Thanks.

22:14.944 --> 22:16.045
Okay, girls.

22:16.844 --> 22:19.048
- Wash your hands.
- Okay, Mom.

22:19.315 --> 22:21.450
We got pizza!
How cool is that?

22:22.151 --> 22:26.788
Well, um,
I think I should be going.

22:27.189 --> 22:29.291
Oh, yeah. No.

22:30.025 --> 22:32.094
Of course. Sorry.

22:32.361 --> 22:33.362
Thank you.

22:34.129 --> 22:36.398
Mom?
You smashed his truck.

22:36.432 --> 22:37.865
Ask him to stay.

22:40.035 --> 22:41.904
Tucker is hardcore buying
my love right now

22:41.937 --> 22:43.405
and it is so working.

22:43.439 --> 22:45.773
His family owns a restaurant
on the water.

22:45.807 --> 22:47.876
Middendorf's.
And I run it.

22:48.877 --> 22:51.080
- And him too, I guess.
- Ah.

22:51.113 --> 22:53.748
She doesn't like to call him
a boyfriend because he's 43.

22:54.049 --> 22:55.017
Eat your pizza.

22:55.284 --> 22:58.988
He sounds like a kind man
who recognizes a good person.

22:59.388 --> 23:00.990
Are you, like,
a Buddhist or something?

23:01.023 --> 23:02.790
Missy,
what kind of question is that?

23:02.824 --> 23:05.394
I don't know.
You just seem different.

23:05.661 --> 23:07.496
Unlike Mom.
Always stressed.

23:07.896 --> 23:10.466
- I'm not always stressed.
- You so are!

23:10.699 --> 23:12.234
Bessie,
will you back me up here?

23:12.268 --> 23:13.435
Am I always stressed?

23:13.669 --> 23:15.571
- Yes.
- Traitor.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.339
You're exhausted the minute
you wake up.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.441
Okay. All right.
I see how it goes.

23:19.475 --> 23:22.177
Everybody gang up on Mom,
who works all day

23:22.211 --> 23:24.380
and has friends like Tucker.
And if it wasn't for her,

23:24.413 --> 23:26.515
you guys would all be
eating microwaved plastic.

23:26.749 --> 23:29.418
- Yeah. What he said. Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:31.620 --> 23:32.921
You guys are funny.

23:33.489 --> 23:34.890
Okay. Homework time.

23:34.923 --> 23:36.458
- Dishes in the sink.
- I should be going.

23:36.492 --> 23:38.927
And, no. I'm not a Buddhist.

23:39.395 --> 23:42.064
I just...
I'm open to the possibility

23:42.097 --> 23:44.466
that whatever happens,
even the bad stuff,

23:45.067 --> 23:46.868
can lead to better things.

23:49.238 --> 23:50.339
Not in this house.

23:59.682 --> 24:01.550
Oh! Leave it to a hurricane

24:01.583 --> 24:03.218
to ruin a perfectly
good evening.

24:03.619 --> 24:05.988
You're not driving back
to Nashville tonight, are you?

24:06.021 --> 24:08.290
No. Not tonight.
No. I got a place downtown.

24:09.325 --> 24:10.526
But, uh, listen.

24:11.193 --> 24:13.262
About today.
I just wanna say that everything

24:13.295 --> 24:17.333
was... I don't know,
really unexpected.

24:19.168 --> 24:21.437
Yeah.
I never thought I'd say this,

24:21.470 --> 24:24.206
but it was a pleasure
running into you.

24:24.239 --> 24:26.375
You have quite a family.

24:28.210 --> 24:29.211
Thanks.

24:30.579 --> 24:31.613
They're good kids.

24:36.285 --> 24:37.519
I meant to say
something earlier,

24:37.553 --> 24:40.155
but the timing just...

24:40.189 --> 24:42.958
- <i>Mom! Spider!</i>
- <i>I wanna see!</i>

24:43.192 --> 24:46.028
And, uh, back to my life.

24:46.295 --> 24:48.430
<i>Mom, here. Please.</i>

24:49.498 --> 24:51.367
- Good night.
- Good night.

25:34.276 --> 25:36.578
<i>This is a triple-threat storm</i>

25:36.612 --> 25:38.313
<i>as it heads in.
And it looks like</i>

25:38.347 --> 25:40.516
<i>it's gonna make landfall
probably late tonight</i>

25:40.549 --> 25:41.950
<i>or early tomorrow morning.</i>

25:42.151 --> 25:44.286
<i>As you can see,
the satellite shows it</i>

25:44.319 --> 25:46.188
<i>has a very
circular presentation,</i>

25:46.221 --> 25:48.090
<i>indicative of a healthy storm.</i>

25:48.424 --> 25:51.126
<i>The good news is,
as Hazel makes landfall,</i>

25:51.160 --> 25:53.495
<i>she should become
a tropical storm once again,</i>

25:53.762 --> 25:56.465
<i>with sustained winds
of 50 to 70 miles an hour,</i>

25:56.498 --> 25:58.600
<i>and could miss Louisiana
altogether.</i>

25:58.634 --> 26:02.171
Yeah, right.

26:02.371 --> 26:05.207
<i>...expect to see
when the storm actually hits?</i>

26:05.441 --> 26:08.076
<i>This storm will
have a large amount of rain.</i>

26:08.110 --> 26:10.446
<i>But it will be the wind that
will cause the most damage.</i>

26:10.479 --> 26:12.548
<i>Historically,
wind causes the most damage</i>

26:12.581 --> 26:14.583
<i>in this type of storm,
toppling trees</i>

26:14.616 --> 26:16.585
<i>and downing powerlines...</i>

26:59.461 --> 27:00.562
Oh, my God.

27:05.367 --> 27:07.569
We're just gonna go
into the bathroom, okay?

27:07.769 --> 27:10.472
Hurry up. Why don't you guys
hop in the tub? It's safe.

27:10.506 --> 27:12.074
Why are we getting
in the bathtub?

27:12.107 --> 27:14.142
'Cause it's kind of...
Remember when Daddy

27:14.176 --> 27:16.111
would take us camping and we
all huddled together

27:16.144 --> 27:17.479
like an adventure?

28:29.718 --> 28:30.786
Hey, guys.

28:30.819 --> 28:32.321
Watch your feet.
Watch your feet.

28:50.439 --> 28:51.573
Mom, are you okay?

28:53.876 --> 28:55.143
Trying to be.

28:56.645 --> 28:58.146
What are we gonna do?

29:05.287 --> 29:07.356
If the cereal is dry,
grab a bowl and eat something

29:07.389 --> 29:08.724
before the milk goes bad.

29:08.757 --> 29:11.693
But why does this
always happen to us?

29:12.728 --> 29:14.196
We're unlucky, I guess.

29:16.665 --> 29:18.734
Come on.
Let's get you some Cheerios.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.136
One, two, three!

29:21.737 --> 29:22.905
Good girl.

29:49.498 --> 29:50.499
Huh.

30:23.632 --> 30:24.833
Are you all okay?

30:30.338 --> 30:31.339
I swear.

30:32.708 --> 30:34.676
My whole life
is like that gut feeling

30:34.710 --> 30:36.745
that something really bad
is going to happen,

30:36.778 --> 30:37.880
and then...

30:39.048 --> 30:40.248
it does.

30:42.718 --> 30:43.719
Coffee?

30:44.619 --> 30:45.620
Thanks.

30:48.523 --> 30:49.591
What are you doing here?

30:51.060 --> 30:53.029
Well, I couldn't very well
leave without knowing

30:53.062 --> 30:54.262
you all were all right.

30:56.032 --> 30:58.366
Do you have
homeowner's insurance?

30:59.234 --> 31:00.903
You mean the only one
I could afford,

31:00.937 --> 31:03.572
with the $5,000 deductible?
Story of my life.

31:04.740 --> 31:06.775
You know,
things don't have to be a series

31:06.808 --> 31:08.643
of unfortunate events.

31:08.878 --> 31:10.812
Well, it sure as hell
feels that way.

31:13.415 --> 31:14.549
I know, but...

31:15.350 --> 31:18.320
I've found that when I think
about what I want

31:18.353 --> 31:22.324
instead of what I don't want
my life is just so much better.

31:23.258 --> 31:25.727
You're one of those people
who wakes up happy, aren't you?

31:26.294 --> 31:28.597
- Let me help.
- How?

31:30.398 --> 31:31.500
With more magic foam?

31:31.901 --> 31:35.004
I just renovated this nice
little Tennessee farmhouse.

31:35.037 --> 31:38.340
This won't be a problem.
It'll just take time and...

31:38.540 --> 31:42.644
And money.
Both of which I... I don't have.

31:42.677 --> 31:44.013
Not as much as you think.

31:44.713 --> 31:46.715
Yeah.

31:47.649 --> 31:49.919
Look, with the price of lumber
being what it is,

31:49.952 --> 31:51.653
we might have to improvise
a little.

31:51.686 --> 31:55.024
But the main goal is to get you
back into a dry house. Yeah?

31:55.224 --> 31:56.926
Yeah,
that would be a good start.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.996
- Let's say $500.
- Five hundred?

32:00.229 --> 32:01.363
Materials.

32:02.397 --> 32:04.566
A roof costs, like, 10,000.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.436
Like I said, we might have
to improvise a little.

32:09.005 --> 32:10.872
But I've got all the tools
in the truck

32:10.907 --> 32:12.942
and I don't have to be back
at class for a week.

32:15.144 --> 32:16.645
Why are you helping me?

32:18.713 --> 32:19.882
Because I can.

32:23.718 --> 32:24.719
Okay.

32:26.788 --> 32:27.789
You're hired.

32:35.430 --> 32:36.899
But only 'cause you
brought me coffee.

32:38.034 --> 32:39.035
Thank you.

32:55.817 --> 32:56.919
Oh, honey. No, no, no.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.089
- Don't throw those away.
- They're wet.

33:00.422 --> 33:01.523
Yeah,
but they'll dry.

33:01.556 --> 33:04.026
And these are the most
important things in the house.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.493
This one's my favorite.

33:05.527 --> 33:07.029
Hmm, mine too.

33:07.964 --> 33:09.031
Missy's right.

33:09.798 --> 33:11.968
I said I had a pony
when I didn't.

33:12.467 --> 33:14.536
Okay. Well...

33:15.403 --> 33:18.107
this is a pony,
and you have this, right?

33:20.910 --> 33:22.844
Mom?

33:23.612 --> 33:25.513
What are we gonna do
about my party?

33:25.780 --> 33:26.848
It's in five days.

33:30.752 --> 33:32.787
- We'll figure it out.
- How?

33:33.289 --> 33:34.522
Look at this place.

33:35.724 --> 33:37.026
I think we should cancel.

33:39.494 --> 33:40.495
No.

33:41.197 --> 33:42.397
No.

33:43.099 --> 33:43.900
No.

33:44.267 --> 33:46.601
I know you think that parents
have all the answers,

33:46.635 --> 33:48.703
but we don't.
Not by the longest shot,

33:48.737 --> 33:52.008
but you know what?
You only turn 16 once.

33:52.607 --> 33:54.010
And we're gonna have a party.

33:54.509 --> 33:55.945
Where'd you get the coffee?

33:56.411 --> 33:58.713
So, it looks like
these two rafters are split.

33:58.747 --> 34:00.883
Otherwise, it's a clean hole.

34:01.783 --> 34:02.952
Meaning what, exactly?

34:03.286 --> 34:05.087
- Hey, Bray.
- Hey, guys.

34:06.488 --> 34:09.225
So, to re-skin this section,
I don't know.

34:09.257 --> 34:12.929
It'll be about 150.
And then the two-by-ten's,

34:12.962 --> 34:16.665
a roll of tar paper, some nails,
you're still less than 200.

34:17.033 --> 34:19.567
And sheet-rocking the ceiling
and re-insulating.

34:20.268 --> 34:21.636
Maybe another 200?

34:23.172 --> 34:24.438
What's he doing here?

34:26.574 --> 34:30.512
- He's fixing the roof.
- How? We're broke, remember?

34:30.812 --> 34:32.114
I don't know.

34:33.081 --> 34:34.083
Magnets.

34:38.955 --> 34:41.856
Oh, look! Nana's here.

34:45.226 --> 34:46.527
Oh.

34:47.562 --> 34:48.563
Oh!

34:49.197 --> 34:53.501
Oh, my Lord!
Is everybody okay?

34:53.534 --> 34:55.972
- Anybody get hurt?
- We slept in a bathtub!

34:56.005 --> 34:56.906
You slept in the bathtub?

34:57.139 --> 35:00.242
- There's a hole in the roof.
- Oh, that is so scary.

35:00.276 --> 35:02.278
I have been trying
to call you all night.

35:02.311 --> 35:03.745
Well, cell towers
must have been down.

35:03.778 --> 35:06.182
Mom was so cool.
She didn't panic or nothing.

35:06.215 --> 35:07.984
She didn't panic or "anything."

35:08.351 --> 35:09.718
Look at this mess.

35:10.252 --> 35:12.021
What did I tell you
about that house?

35:12.054 --> 35:13.588
And now... Who is that?

35:14.622 --> 35:15.857
Oh, that's Bray.

35:15.891 --> 35:17.059
He's gonna fix the roof.

35:17.093 --> 35:18.560
Just like he fixed Mom's bumper.

35:18.593 --> 35:19.728
He had pizza with us.

35:19.761 --> 35:21.931
- What pizza?
- Stuffed crust.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.900
Yes. Bray is going to try
to fix the roof.

35:25.267 --> 35:27.036
- Bray?
- Is he licensed?

35:27.470 --> 35:28.803
He's from Tennessee.

35:29.038 --> 35:31.073
Can you say hello
to my mother-in-law, Bobby?

35:31.107 --> 35:33.042
- Bobby, Bray.
- Bobby, Bray.

35:33.075 --> 35:34.977
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh-huh. And you.

35:35.277 --> 35:36.946
Mom smashed into him
with the van.

35:36.979 --> 35:40.715
I didn't smash into him.
I tapped his bumper.

35:40.749 --> 35:43.152
And yours fell off.

35:43.685 --> 35:44.552
What's the verdict?

35:44.987 --> 35:47.689
I'm gonna swing by the lumber
yard, pick up some materials.

35:47.722 --> 35:49.691
Also see if I can snag a blower
or two

35:49.724 --> 35:50.893
and get those floors dry.

35:51.961 --> 35:53.329
Well, we'll be here.

35:53.362 --> 35:56.831
Oh, no, you won't.
These children can't stay here.

35:56.865 --> 35:58.300
Why not?
Their bedrooms are dry.

35:58.334 --> 36:02.038
Honey, I have two words for you,
black mold.

36:02.271 --> 36:04.706
And Greg is sick already
as it is.

36:04.739 --> 36:06.909
- Well, what about school?
- The power's out,

36:06.942 --> 36:09.611
and the radio said they're
closed today and tomorrow.

36:09.644 --> 36:10.645
Yes!

36:11.713 --> 36:13.916
Why not spend a few nights
with me

36:13.949 --> 36:15.850
and just maybe
come up with a plan?

36:16.318 --> 36:18.020
Sure. You're right.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.755
Why don't you guys go pack up
some clothes?

36:20.789 --> 36:22.024
We're gonna go to Nana's.

36:22.557 --> 36:25.995
Two minutes, you have.
Don't pack everything.

36:26.028 --> 36:27.029
Fun!

36:27.695 --> 36:29.731
- Thank you.
- Thank you, honey.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.168
Um, do you think we could stop
by the restaurant

36:32.201 --> 36:33.936
on the way out?
I wanna check on Tuck.

36:34.370 --> 36:36.038
Who is this complete stranger

36:36.072 --> 36:38.573
that you are trusting
your home with?

36:38.908 --> 36:41.043
Not everyone
is a serial killer, Bobby.

36:41.077 --> 36:43.711
I mean, he's a college
professor for goodness sake.

36:44.447 --> 36:47.283
Well, you can't be too careful
these days.

36:48.050 --> 36:50.752
The only thing of value
in that house are the kids,

36:50.785 --> 36:52.354
and they're coming with us.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.857
So, I'm just gonna believe
that he's not gonna screw us

36:55.891 --> 36:58.060
and he's gonna do the best job
he can.

36:58.327 --> 36:59.929
Have you met people lately?

37:08.070 --> 37:09.771
So, we'll get out
of your hair then.

37:10.239 --> 37:11.840
She seems worried about you.

37:12.774 --> 37:15.710
Well, we're all used to playing
defense around here.

37:16.979 --> 37:18.981
But I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

37:20.116 --> 37:22.684
- What am I trying to do?
- Give us hope.

37:23.385 --> 37:25.955
But I am trying to raise
my kids to be realistic.

37:25.988 --> 37:29.657
Their father was a dreamer,
and apparently that's genetic,

37:29.691 --> 37:30.926
especially with Greg.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.895
And I just want to keep
their feet

37:32.928 --> 37:34.662
firmly planted on the ground.

37:35.097 --> 37:36.932
- Roger that.
- And your next question

37:36.966 --> 37:39.101
is about my husband,
but you're too polite to ask.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.904
He died
just over five years ago.

37:43.771 --> 37:45.141
I'm sorry, truly.

37:46.708 --> 37:49.677
Me too.
He's really missing out.

37:51.113 --> 37:53.748
We should exchange our numbers,
right?

37:54.383 --> 37:55.417
Yes, of course.

38:11.934 --> 38:13.202
Oh, Tuck.

38:14.136 --> 38:15.171
Nice, huh?

38:15.504 --> 38:17.273
It's a good thing
we boarded it up.

38:17.306 --> 38:18.806
But we're all right.

38:19.241 --> 38:21.443
- How is everyone?
- Uh, fine.

38:21.477 --> 38:23.245
We had some damage to our roof,

38:23.279 --> 38:24.779
but I have someone
working on it.

38:24.812 --> 38:26.916
And we're gonna head
to Bobby's for a few days.

38:26.949 --> 38:28.250
You all could have stayed
with me.

38:28.284 --> 38:29.285
Do you wanna tell her that?

38:29.318 --> 38:31.153
Hell no.
She'd never forgive me.

38:31.187 --> 38:33.088
And I'm trying to stay
on her good side.

38:33.355 --> 38:34.789
Who's doing your roof?

38:34.822 --> 38:36.125
Oh, just a guy.
You don't know him.

38:36.625 --> 38:38.726
- Okay.
- So, I'm gonna get them settled,

38:38.760 --> 38:40.795
and I'll borrow her car,
and I'll come back and help you.

38:40.828 --> 38:42.097
No. You take care
of business.

38:42.131 --> 38:44.033
- I'll call you later.
- Really?

38:44.366 --> 38:45.467
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

38:45.501 --> 38:47.002
- Okay.
- See you, Bob!

38:51.073 --> 38:53.342
Has Tucker lost weight?
He looks good.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.077
Uh, nope. I don't think so.

38:55.110 --> 38:57.880
Any developments
I should know about?

38:58.180 --> 39:00.782
- Why rock the boat?
- Cause he's a good man.

39:01.617 --> 39:04.486
I know that's a strange thing
for a mother-in-law to say,

39:04.520 --> 39:09.757
but I also know that, you know,
it can be hard to move on.

39:11.826 --> 39:13.861
I'm a widow, too, remember?

39:14.196 --> 39:16.098
I just don't see the point
in forcing something

39:16.131 --> 39:18.133
that neither one of us
needs or wants.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.062
Sign here.

40:21.297 --> 40:22.331
Thank you.

40:23.532 --> 40:26.335
- Hi. Hello.
- Hi, I'm Bray Johnson.

40:27.636 --> 40:29.271
Is that his?
Is that that guy's?

40:29.305 --> 40:30.939
- Excuse me. Is that yours?
- Oh, my God.

40:30.973 --> 40:34.209
- Hey, I'm Matt Wells.
- Bray Johnson. How you doing?

40:34.243 --> 40:36.111
<i>Can I get you
a drink or something?</i>

40:36.145 --> 40:38.080
<i>Okay, I'm just saying,</i>

40:38.113 --> 40:41.150
if I could put pressure at six,
six point zero, six three...

40:42.418 --> 40:44.253
Gentlemen, this is Matt,

40:44.286 --> 40:45.988
the inventor
I was talking about.

40:52.895 --> 40:54.630
Hey, I've been meaning
to call you.

40:54.663 --> 40:55.531
<i>How'd it go?</i>

40:55.964 --> 41:00.069
- Did you survive big bad Hazel?
- <i>Uh, yes and no.</i>

41:00.102 --> 41:02.037
I might have to stick around
a few more days.

41:02.071 --> 41:03.172
Do you mind?

41:03.205 --> 41:05.541
Not at all.
So, what happened?

41:06.041 --> 41:08.510
Huh, I'm not quite sure.

41:08.544 --> 41:10.612
I think the universe
is trying to tell me something.

41:12.481 --> 41:14.416
What did she say
when you gave it to her?

41:16.185 --> 41:18.520
Well, that's the thing. I, uh...

41:19.388 --> 41:20.855
I haven't told her yet.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.425
Well, why the hell not?

41:25.361 --> 41:27.996
That is what I am trying
to figure out.

41:34.169 --> 41:36.038
Where are all the kids?

41:36.638 --> 41:39.575
Well, we're mostly grown-ups
here who've retired.

41:39.608 --> 41:41.076
So, where are they?

41:41.110 --> 41:42.578
They're just sitting
in their houses,

41:42.611 --> 41:44.079
watching <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

41:44.279 --> 41:48.984
It may not look it, but this is
a very active community.

41:49.184 --> 41:53.088
We got golf and swimming
and yoga and...

41:53.522 --> 41:57.326
We just like to keep things
nice and neat and safe and...

41:57.359 --> 42:00.596
Oh, my gosh!
We got a pond and a gazebo.

42:00.629 --> 42:02.564
What's a gazebo do?

42:02.598 --> 42:04.400
Just looks pretty.

42:04.433 --> 42:07.002
It's where old people sit
and complain about their knees

42:07.035 --> 42:08.036
- and stuff.
- Missy.

42:08.070 --> 42:11.306
- What? You said it.
- Let's just go in.

42:29.057 --> 42:30.559
That is a big hole!

42:33.162 --> 42:34.296
Sorry, what?

42:34.329 --> 42:35.697
They were damn lucky.

42:37.132 --> 42:38.133
You the roof guy?

42:38.667 --> 42:41.437
Today I am.
Name's Bray.

42:41.670 --> 42:44.106
Tuck Middendorf.
I own the place on the water.

42:44.139 --> 42:45.541
Miranda wanted me to check in.

42:45.574 --> 42:47.409
Uh, you're the one
who sent the pizza.

42:47.443 --> 42:49.611
- Yeah. How did you...
- You scored a bunch

42:49.645 --> 42:51.280
of points there, my friend.

42:51.680 --> 42:52.981
Oh, yeah?

42:54.583 --> 42:56.051
How do you know Miranda?

42:56.418 --> 42:58.187
Oh, well, I don't, really.

42:59.421 --> 43:00.956
Why are you fixing her roof?

43:01.156 --> 43:03.325
That's a very good question.

43:03.659 --> 43:06.361
Hey, could you, uh, grab me
that parachute bag there?

43:07.396 --> 43:09.965
Yeah.
No, that one, yeah.

43:10.232 --> 43:11.533
You can throw it on up here.

43:22.344 --> 43:23.378
There you go.

43:23.412 --> 43:24.713
- Do you want a hand?
- Yeah.

43:25.414 --> 43:26.415
Thanks.

43:29.585 --> 43:31.053
Heck of a view up here.

43:31.086 --> 43:32.754
Yeah,
that's why guys do roofs.

43:35.123 --> 43:38.126
Oh, yeah, this whole section's
gonna have to be replaced.

43:38.160 --> 43:41.363
Yeah, I'm gonna re-sheet
and re-paper tomorrow.

43:41.396 --> 43:44.366
Forecast says there's no rain
coming, so it's all good.

43:44.399 --> 43:46.168
- But you're not licensed.
- No, no.

43:46.201 --> 43:48.136
I'm just lending a hand.

43:48.337 --> 43:50.305
Well, I wish Miranda had
checked with me.

43:50.339 --> 43:52.107
I would have paid to hire
a real roofer.

43:52.741 --> 43:53.742
No offense.

43:54.543 --> 43:55.611
None taken.

43:57.079 --> 43:58.480
She's stubborn that way.

43:59.748 --> 44:01.483
How long have you two
been together?

44:02.518 --> 44:04.152
Oh, a few years.

44:04.954 --> 44:08.423
She came to work for me about
a year after her husband died.

44:09.191 --> 44:11.593
Good guy too,
from what I hear.

44:12.728 --> 44:14.463
That must have been really
painful.

44:15.230 --> 44:17.199
Widowed. Three kids.

44:17.232 --> 44:19.101
I think it's made her more
cautious.

44:21.236 --> 44:22.070
I'm the same way.

44:22.104 --> 44:23.639
Why I haven't
pushed things farther.

44:24.007 --> 44:24.706
You know?

44:25.008 --> 44:27.276
Well, things can change
if you want them to.

44:28.710 --> 44:30.245
I just want her to be happy.

44:32.381 --> 44:33.815
Can't say I blame you.

44:34.650 --> 44:36.718
- What I want...
- Nice meeting you, Bray.

44:36.752 --> 44:38.120
Oh, yeah. You too, Tucker.

44:38.153 --> 44:39.788
Give me a shout if this
gets to be too much.

44:39.989 --> 44:41.290
Will do.

44:43.893 --> 44:45.193
Oh.

44:48.564 --> 44:50.532
Why do people like puzzles?

44:51.567 --> 44:52.301
They don't.

44:52.668 --> 44:54.636
They just need something
to do when they're bored.

44:54.670 --> 44:57.072
Oh! You make this sound
like prison.

44:57.472 --> 44:59.308
Look at all these pieces.

45:00.242 --> 45:03.312
- This is gonna take us a week.
- Forever.

45:03.612 --> 45:06.348
Now, look.
I know you love that house.

45:06.648 --> 45:09.251
- But I think we...
- Can we not do this right now?

45:09.484 --> 45:11.853
I was in real estate
for 40 years.

45:12.487 --> 45:14.556
That place could sell in a day.

45:15.157 --> 45:17.292
Or it could take a year
and a half.

45:17.326 --> 45:18.827
You don't have that kind
of time.

45:19.062 --> 45:21.898
It's too much for me
to think about right now.

45:21.931 --> 45:25.601
Well, that's all I'm asking
is, you know,

45:25.634 --> 45:27.502
that you think about it.

45:29.538 --> 45:31.740
I mean, y'all
on top of each other.

45:32.441 --> 45:35.177
Those girls
need another bedroom.

45:36.511 --> 45:39.147
You could get your money out
and then some.

45:39.181 --> 45:40.649
Not with a hole in the roof.

45:40.849 --> 45:45.654
Oh, honey, you and I both know
that that house is a tear-down.

46:02.671 --> 46:04.406
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hey! Hey.

46:04.439 --> 46:06.141
I thought you might like
a status update.

46:06.441 --> 46:07.910
Only if it's good news.

46:08.410 --> 46:11.446
Well, I ran out of daylight,
but once the power comes back on

46:11.480 --> 46:13.215
I should be done
the day after tomorrow.

46:13.782 --> 46:16.251
- That's fantastic.
- <i>I got rid of that limb,</i>

46:16.284 --> 46:17.853
<i>I did a little triage
on the hole.</i>

46:18.353 --> 46:20.589
The floors seem fine,
but I'll still run the blower

46:20.622 --> 46:22.791
- all night just to make sure.
- <i>I don't care</i>

46:22.824 --> 46:24.726
<i>about that just as long
as we're dry.</i>

46:25.427 --> 46:27.596
All right. Well,
I'll check back in tomorrow.

46:28.630 --> 46:29.698
Wait, Bray.

46:36.471 --> 46:37.606
Where are you?

46:38.807 --> 46:40.342
What are you doing right now?

46:40.542 --> 46:43.980
I'm sitting on your roof,
taking in this gorgeous sunset.

46:44.013 --> 46:44.914
You?

46:48.784 --> 46:49.785
Stressing.

46:51.386 --> 46:52.654
Is it about the money?

46:52.688 --> 46:55.624
No. It's everything. I...

46:56.625 --> 46:59.828
My job, kids, Tucker.

47:02.831 --> 47:05.434
I think I might actually have
to sell the house.

47:06.568 --> 47:08.004
Ooh, that's a big one.

47:08.037 --> 47:10.439
No kidding. I just know
somebody's going to scoop it up

47:10.472 --> 47:12.975
and tear it down.
And it just breaks my heart.

47:13.675 --> 47:16.645
Look. When the time is right,
you'll know what to do.

47:17.446 --> 47:19.648
Is that another one
of your life lessons?

47:21.316 --> 47:22.784
I went through a divorce
ten years ago.

47:22.818 --> 47:24.553
It really knocked me on my ass.

47:24.987 --> 47:26.254
Were there kids?

47:26.889 --> 47:27.924
No, no.

47:27.957 --> 47:29.624
We wanted to save up
a little money

47:29.658 --> 47:31.526
before starting a family
and it turns out

47:31.560 --> 47:33.462
she started one
with somebody else.

47:34.296 --> 47:35.898
Oh, my God.
That...

47:36.765 --> 47:38.500
You must have been...

47:38.700 --> 47:40.602
Devastated. Yeah.

47:41.269 --> 47:43.505
And then I got angry
and started blaming

47:43.538 --> 47:45.340
everything on everybody else.

47:46.308 --> 47:47.609
That doesn't sound like you.

47:49.478 --> 47:51.680
Not anymore.
That was before.

47:52.215 --> 47:53.415
<i>Before?</i>

47:54.716 --> 47:56.518
Before another kind
of wake-up call.

47:58.921 --> 48:02.959
Well... I didn't mean to pry.

48:02.992 --> 48:04.726
No, no, no, no, you didn't.

48:05.594 --> 48:08.697
It's just that sometimes
the best thing to do is...

48:10.099 --> 48:13.602
wait till everything
becomes clear.

48:18.640 --> 48:22.778
Well, that's great news
about the house, Professor.

48:23.779 --> 48:24.914
Thank you.

48:24.947 --> 48:27.749
You're welcome.
And have a good evening.

48:28.550 --> 48:30.619
- <i>Good night.</i>
- Good night.

49:00.749 --> 49:02.919
- Good morning, Mr. Johnson.
- Good morning, Sloane.

49:03.552 --> 49:05.922
I heard you extended your stay.

49:06.255 --> 49:08.390
Yeah, I'm just trying to make
myself useful

49:08.423 --> 49:09.926
to a friend up in Madisonville.

49:09.959 --> 49:12.694
Which reminds me, I'm expecting
a pretty important package

49:12.727 --> 49:13.762
in the next few days.

49:13.795 --> 49:15.097
Could you keep your eyes
open for it?

49:15.330 --> 49:18.100
- Important package. You got it.
- Thanks.

49:21.503 --> 49:22.972
Keep holding it
over like that,

49:23.005 --> 49:24.773
'cause you won't spill anything.

49:24.806 --> 49:27.409
Oh! Bobby.
What are you doing here?

49:27.442 --> 49:28.743
We're helping Mommy.

49:28.777 --> 49:31.379
Northshore Food Bank
put out a call,

49:31.413 --> 49:33.748
and Miranda thought
you might be able to help.

49:33.782 --> 49:36.052
There are a lot of people
on this side of the lake

49:36.085 --> 49:37.786
without power.
I didn't think you'd mind

49:37.819 --> 49:40.589
- putting all this to good use.
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

49:40.622 --> 49:42.858
But I could have asked Manny
or Charmaine to help.

49:42.892 --> 49:45.928
- You didn't have to come in.
- Oh, well, it is a workday.

49:45.962 --> 49:47.930
Well, maybe
she just missed you.

49:47.964 --> 49:50.765
- You ever think of that?
- You did?

49:51.167 --> 49:52.367
What?

49:52.734 --> 49:54.636
Oh, uh, nothing.

49:54.669 --> 49:56.638
So, after we drop this off,
we're gonna skedaddle.

49:56.671 --> 49:57.572
I'll call you later.

49:57.606 --> 49:59.641
You know, I thought I might
show Miranda

49:59.674 --> 50:02.078
that new housing development
out by me.

50:02.644 --> 50:05.447
You know, 'cause she's thinking
about selling her place.

50:05.948 --> 50:08.516
- You are?
- No.

50:09.185 --> 50:12.654
I checked Zillow this morning.
Lots of listings.

50:12.922 --> 50:15.624
But after this storm,
yours is gonna stand out.

50:15.657 --> 50:17.126
I'm just saying is all.

50:17.425 --> 50:20.729
If we move, how will Santa know
where to find us?

50:20.762 --> 50:21.998
Oh, honey.

50:22.031 --> 50:24.833
When you move,
Mommy will fill out a change

50:24.866 --> 50:26.701
of address card.

50:27.069 --> 50:28.938
And the post office
will send that

50:28.971 --> 50:31.173
straight to the North Pole.

50:31.573 --> 50:33.742
What's wrong with our house?

50:33.775 --> 50:35.510
Oh, everything, sweetheart.

50:35.844 --> 50:36.913
Bobby?

50:38.680 --> 50:42.151
I gotta go. Payroll doesn't stop
just 'cause the power's out.

50:43.718 --> 50:46.055
- I'll call you later.
- Okay. Thank you.

50:48.057 --> 50:51.726
Let's go easy on that pepper.
That will give you the sneezes.

53:21.043 --> 53:22.044
Whoa.

53:25.181 --> 53:26.614
Ladies first.

53:28.918 --> 53:30.252
And the gentleman.

53:32.188 --> 53:34.589
Uh, Nana? Do you have any
Cinnamon Toast Crunch?

53:34.823 --> 53:37.725
Now, that is protein.
That is good for muscles.

53:38.260 --> 53:40.129
We usually just have cereal.

53:40.162 --> 53:42.264
Fresh out of cereal.
I'm sorry, honey.

53:42.298 --> 53:44.666
This bread tastes gross.

53:44.866 --> 53:47.203
Well, that's because
it's gluten-free.

53:47.536 --> 53:50.738
And when you get to be my age,
you'll thank me.

53:51.173 --> 53:52.208
What's gluten?

53:52.241 --> 53:54.276
It's... That's a thing in food.

53:55.743 --> 53:58.780
Mm! "Hi, gang. The power's back
on at the house,

53:58.813 --> 53:59.882
and the roof is fixed."

53:59.915 --> 54:00.950
- Yes.
- Yes.

54:00.983 --> 54:02.218
Oh, no, already?

54:18.033 --> 54:20.402
Whoa, cool!
A skylight.

54:20.869 --> 54:22.804
It's actually kinda legit.

54:23.339 --> 54:26.375
- Whoa! Pretty cool!
- How'd you get that up there?

54:26.408 --> 54:28.743
A new ceiling.
Pretty impressive.

54:28.776 --> 54:31.113
What exactly is that thing
on the roof?

54:32.148 --> 54:35.251
Um, weather-proof Band-Aid.

54:35.284 --> 54:38.420
- Where'd it come from?
- It just appeared.

54:38.621 --> 54:40.890
- Like the pizza?
- No. No, no.

54:40.923 --> 54:43.459
That was because of Tucker,
and this is because Bray

54:43.492 --> 54:45.995
worked really, really hard
to find something that'd fit.

54:46.028 --> 54:48.130
It was probably floating
around in the bayou

54:48.164 --> 54:50.633
waiting to be useful.
And then it found me.

54:51.100 --> 54:53.002
Or it was just a coincidence.

54:53.369 --> 54:57.273
Um, "coincidence is God's way
of remaining anonymous."

54:57.573 --> 54:58.840
Who said that?

54:59.741 --> 55:00.876
Einstein.

55:00.910 --> 55:02.444
E equals MC squared guy?

55:03.078 --> 55:06.916
He also said that every person
should ask themselves,

55:06.949 --> 55:08.816
"Is this a friendly universe?"

55:09.251 --> 55:10.052
Why?

55:10.352 --> 55:14.789
Well, because your answer
determines your life.

55:17.092 --> 55:18.961
Are you sure
you're not from California?

55:18.994 --> 55:21.063
No, ma'am.

55:21.096 --> 55:23.731
So, you're saying the magnet
in your head

55:23.765 --> 55:25.401
connected you to that piece
of fiberglass...

55:25.434 --> 55:27.036
Okay, gang.
That's enough questions.

55:27.069 --> 55:29.104
This man has a life.
Say goodbye to Bray.

55:29.305 --> 55:31.440
- Bye. Thank you for the roof.
- Bye, Bray.

55:31.473 --> 55:33.108
Um, let me get my checkbook.

55:33.808 --> 55:34.809
Okay.

55:35.277 --> 55:37.213
- Let's go to my room.
- Okay, baby.

55:41.050 --> 55:42.451
Could I ask you a question?

55:43.919 --> 55:45.888
- Shoot.
- What happened to the envelope?

55:48.224 --> 55:50.192
I haven't given it to her yet.

55:51.393 --> 55:52.727
Why not?

55:53.062 --> 55:55.431
Well, I put it in the mailbox
after the pizza,

55:55.464 --> 55:57.166
but it flew away.

55:57.633 --> 56:00.236
So, I had to get a new one.

56:00.269 --> 56:01.769
What's in it?

56:02.438 --> 56:03.738
Grown-up stuff.

56:04.907 --> 56:06.741
But definitely something good.

56:15.484 --> 56:16.418
Here you go.

56:16.719 --> 56:18.988
Five hundred very
grateful dollars.

56:19.021 --> 56:21.490
Just do me a favor and don't
cash it until next week.

56:21.523 --> 56:22.790
Understood.

56:24.126 --> 56:25.793
So, you're off to Nashville?

56:26.996 --> 56:28.264
Yeah.

56:28.297 --> 56:30.733
I pretty much got my hands
full until winter break.

56:31.567 --> 56:34.003
I still don't understand why
you helped us.

56:35.271 --> 56:37.206
I think you and I collided
for a reason.

56:37.973 --> 56:41.510
And who's to say?
Maybe we helped each other.

56:41.543 --> 56:42.544
Miranda?

56:44.246 --> 56:46.382
Honey? It's Tuck.

56:46.415 --> 56:48.450
Oh! Will you tell him
I'll call him back?

56:48.484 --> 56:49.918
He says it's urgent.

56:50.419 --> 56:51.387
Excuse me.

56:56.058 --> 56:58.494
Hi. Um, can I call you back
in, like, two minutes?

56:58.694 --> 57:00.862
<i>Hold on. Do you
and the kids want to come</i>

57:00.896 --> 57:02.498
- <i>to the opening tonight?</i>
- Okay.

57:02.531 --> 57:04.099
<i>See if Bobby
wants to come too.</i>

57:04.133 --> 57:04.967
Sure. Let me check.

57:05.301 --> 57:08.170
Tucker wants to take us all out
for the re-opening.

57:08.203 --> 57:10.805
Um, and he wants to know
if you wanna come.

57:11.173 --> 57:12.408
I wouldn't miss it.

57:13.309 --> 57:15.577
- Great. We'll see you at seven.
- <i>All right. Great.</i>

57:15.778 --> 57:17.379
- <i>See you tonight.</i>
- Okay. Bye.

57:20.916 --> 57:21.950
So, you were saying?

57:25.621 --> 57:28.357
Something about us
colliding for a reason?

57:29.325 --> 57:32.294
Yeah. Well, maybe it was just
a chance for me

57:32.328 --> 57:34.363
to meet a really cool woman.

57:34.697 --> 57:37.266
You're doing a hell of a job
raising three kids on your own.

57:38.367 --> 57:39.368
Thank you.

57:40.302 --> 57:43.605
Although, I think I got
the better end of the deal.

57:44.740 --> 57:49.311
Oh, hey, listen, I still have
the chainsaw for another day

57:49.511 --> 57:51.480
if you want me to free up
your van.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.882
I can swing by
on my way out tomorrow.

57:53.916 --> 57:55.084
I could use the firewood.

57:55.117 --> 57:57.486
- By all means.
- Oh, honey.

57:57.519 --> 57:59.221
Tucker can do it.

58:00.055 --> 58:01.856
Tucker with a chainsaw?

58:03.525 --> 58:04.660
Okay.

58:04.693 --> 58:07.496
Um, but I'm making the coffee.

58:08.097 --> 58:09.098
Deal.

58:14.536 --> 58:16.672
Everybody?
If I could have your attention?

58:16.705 --> 58:20.008
Um, I'd like to take this
opportunity

58:20.309 --> 58:22.678
and thank Manny
and all of his peeps

58:22.711 --> 58:25.147
for working their butts off
to get this place

58:25.180 --> 58:27.049
up and running again.

58:27.082 --> 58:28.517
Manny!

58:31.487 --> 58:33.989
Every now and then a storm
comes along

58:34.022 --> 58:36.258
and it not only rattles
your business,

58:36.291 --> 58:40.262
but it rattles your life
and the choices you've made

58:40.295 --> 58:41.497
in that life.

58:41.830 --> 58:45.634
I, uh...
I've always wanted a family.

58:46.468 --> 58:50.272
For whatever reason,
it just wasn't in the cards.

58:50.305 --> 58:54.176
You know, maybe I... I focused
too much on the business.

58:56.044 --> 58:57.045
But, uh...

58:59.081 --> 59:02.317
I would like to change that
right here and right now.

59:12.728 --> 59:15.697
Miranda Wells,
will you marry me?

59:23.405 --> 59:25.107
- Yeah.
- Yes!

59:28.110 --> 59:29.478
All right.

59:32.748 --> 59:34.249
Here we go.

59:35.617 --> 59:36.652
Oh, sorry.

59:36.685 --> 59:39.054
You know what?
Let's just put it...

59:39.087 --> 59:40.289
We'll fix that later.

59:40.622 --> 59:42.624
Whatever!
She said yes!

59:46.628 --> 59:48.130
Thank you.

59:49.498 --> 59:50.934
Thank you.

59:52.234 --> 59:53.235
Woo!

59:53.502 --> 59:55.471
- I love that.
- I'm so excited.

59:55.838 --> 59:58.073
- Okay.
- All right.

59:59.174 --> 01:00:01.310
Hey. What happened to your van?

01:00:01.343 --> 01:00:03.312
Oh, it's still stuck
behind a tree.

01:00:03.345 --> 01:00:06.281
But not to worry. Her handyman
is gonna chop it up

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:07.716
first thing in the morning.

01:00:07.749 --> 01:00:09.051
My handyman?

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:13.489
Hey. Why don't I spend
the night at the house

01:00:13.856 --> 01:00:17.359
so you two lovebirds
can celebrate your engagement?

01:00:17.626 --> 01:00:19.728
Yeah. That would be terrific.

01:00:20.796 --> 01:00:22.297
Yeah. Um,

01:00:22.798 --> 01:00:25.667
you guys don't mind
if Nana stays over? Right?

01:00:26.134 --> 01:00:27.536
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yup.

01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:30.506
I'll see you in the morning.

01:00:30.706 --> 01:00:32.674
Hey. I'm gonna talk to Doug
for one second.

01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:34.643
Kids, do not stay up
all night long.

01:00:34.676 --> 01:00:35.444
Hey, Doug!

01:00:35.811 --> 01:00:38.480
- Congratulations, Mom.
- Congrats, Tucker...

01:00:38.514 --> 01:00:39.515
Thank you.

01:00:40.048 --> 01:00:41.750
Well, let's get in
the car.

01:00:41.783 --> 01:00:43.285
Goodnight, sweetie.

01:00:55.297 --> 01:00:57.466
All right. Here we go.
Keep them closed.

01:00:57.499 --> 01:00:59.535
I got you. I got you.

01:00:59.768 --> 01:01:01.770
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

01:01:02.005 --> 01:01:03.272
Almost there.

01:01:04.206 --> 01:01:05.741
And...

01:01:07.142 --> 01:01:08.143
open.

01:01:12.481 --> 01:01:13.348
I spoke to Doug.

01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:16.285
I told him I wanted it here
first thing this morning.

01:01:16.318 --> 01:01:18.287
And boom. Here it is.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.722
- Tucker?
- I cannot have my fiancÃ©e

01:01:20.756 --> 01:01:23.358
driving around
in some old minivan.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.461
What will the neighbors think?

01:01:27.129 --> 01:01:28.263
Huh!

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.301
Wow.

01:01:33.669 --> 01:01:36.672
It's beautiful. Thank you.

01:01:36.705 --> 01:01:37.773
You like it?

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.309
It's not, uh, too small?

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.543
Like the ring?

01:01:42.011 --> 01:01:44.580
I just need to get that sized.

01:01:44.613 --> 01:01:46.448
Well, let's go do that
right now.

01:01:46.481 --> 01:01:49.217
I can't, babe. I have to run
errands before work.

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:50.419
What errands?

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:52.721
I have to get it together
before Missy's party.

01:01:53.455 --> 01:01:56.425
- Party?
- Her 16th birthday, silly.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:57.894
She talked about it last night.

01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:00.796
Right. Yeah. Sorry,
I was a little distracted.

01:02:01.196 --> 01:02:02.899
Well, she's worried all of her
friends are going

01:02:02.932 --> 01:02:04.766
to another party
that has food trucks.

01:02:05.068 --> 01:02:07.202
Well, I can get a food truck.

01:02:07.235 --> 01:02:09.705
No. She doesn't need
a food truck.

01:02:09.738 --> 01:02:11.273
She needs balloons and a cake.

01:02:11.873 --> 01:02:13.675
Well, what should I get her?

01:02:14.043 --> 01:02:16.311
Oh, nothing. Just a card.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.414
That says what?

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.735
You okay?

01:02:40.836 --> 01:02:42.604
I don't wanna talk
about it.

01:02:47.509 --> 01:02:50.212
- Which part?
- What do you mean?

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.682
Which part do you not wanna
talk about?

01:02:53.715 --> 01:02:57.152
The reason you're pissed or
that thing you just threw away?

01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.821
Both.

01:03:00.856 --> 01:03:01.857
Okay.

01:03:02.391 --> 01:03:04.726
You wanna talk about
the third thing?

01:03:05.727 --> 01:03:06.728
What third thing?

01:03:07.897 --> 01:03:09.798
Well, my guess is the reason
you're upset

01:03:09.831 --> 01:03:12.534
has nothing to do
with that thing you threw away.

01:03:12.902 --> 01:03:14.369
How would you know that?

01:03:15.071 --> 01:03:17.205
Word is your mom got engaged.

01:03:19.976 --> 01:03:21.176
Yeah.

01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:25.547
Which I imagine stirs up
a whole boatload of feelings

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.815
about your dad.

01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:31.219
Yeah.

01:03:33.555 --> 01:03:35.791
Which I suspect
you just took out on...

01:03:36.324 --> 01:03:39.461
whatever it is that was in that
box you just threw away.

01:03:41.563 --> 01:03:44.599
Maybe. Yeah.

01:03:46.401 --> 01:03:47.736
Did it deserve it?

01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:50.472
It was just a stupid invention.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.774
You mind showing me?

01:03:54.476 --> 01:03:56.578
<i>It's supposed to be
an automatic chicken feeder</i>

01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:58.814
for science class.
If it worked,

01:03:59.015 --> 01:04:00.983
I could sell it,
and we could make some money,

01:04:01.184 --> 01:04:03.452
so Mom wouldn't have
to marry Tucker.

01:04:04.453 --> 01:04:05.821
And why would you say that?

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:09.624
- She doesn't love him.
- You sure about that?

01:04:10.592 --> 01:04:11.827
Not like Dad.

01:04:15.764 --> 01:04:17.499
All right. Here's the thing.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:20.635
I think if you took a couple
links out here.

01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.270
Right.

01:04:23.538 --> 01:04:25.307
There. And then...

01:04:25.841 --> 01:04:27.877
you increase the tension here.

01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:31.246
That should work.

01:04:37.786 --> 01:04:38.787
It works.

01:04:40.355 --> 01:04:42.624
- You still wanna throw it out?
- No way!

01:04:43.192 --> 01:04:44.826
Let me tell you something.

01:04:45.293 --> 01:04:48.597
All your dad ever wanted
was for you to be happy.

01:04:49.397 --> 01:04:50.799
How would you know that?

01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:56.038
Well, because dad's
are like that.

01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:16.458
Why are you so nice to us?

01:05:17.126 --> 01:05:18.693
You get what you give.

01:05:20.997 --> 01:05:23.532
- See?
- That's not true.

01:05:23.565 --> 01:05:24.699
Not when you're 15.

01:05:25.367 --> 01:05:28.070
Ah, come on. I think you're
selling yourself short.

01:05:30.806 --> 01:05:33.642
Kit Riley's having her party
tomorrow, same day as mine.

01:05:33.675 --> 01:05:35.044
And she's having food trucks,

01:05:35.077 --> 01:05:37.013
and she's the most popular girl
in school.

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:39.648
Okay. Let me ask you
a question.

01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:42.317
What would you rather have?

01:05:42.717 --> 01:05:45.888
Two hundred Instagram friends
or five real ones?

01:05:47.455 --> 01:05:48.657
Five real.

01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:51.560
And are they coming here
tomorrow?

01:05:51.593 --> 01:05:53.963
- Yep.
- Okay. Then focus on having

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:55.097
a good time with them.

01:05:57.133 --> 01:05:59.835
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

01:06:00.735 --> 01:06:04.040
What would make you happy?
Not your friends, you.

01:06:08.643 --> 01:06:10.112
Wait. If you don't know
what you want,

01:06:10.146 --> 01:06:11.847
how can you ask for it?

01:06:15.918 --> 01:06:16.986
Taffy.

01:06:17.652 --> 01:06:18.620
Hmm?

01:06:19.821 --> 01:06:21.924
We used to make taffy
when I was a kid.

01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:24.961
All of us.
Mom loves taffy.

01:06:24.994 --> 01:06:26.561
Well, there you go.

01:06:26.595 --> 01:06:29.731
And now that you've got all
this firewood,

01:06:29.764 --> 01:06:32.801
you could, uh, maybe have
a bonfire down by the water,

01:06:32.834 --> 01:06:35.604
roast some hot dogs,
make S'mores.

01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:37.006
How do you know about S'mores?

01:06:37.606 --> 01:06:39.876
You don't get this old
without living.

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:51.120
Mom? What the heck?

01:06:53.122 --> 01:06:54.123
Tucker.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.759
Wow. That's lot of firewood.

01:06:58.928 --> 01:07:01.496
I hear congratulations
are in order.

01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:03.698
Imagine my surprise.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:06.501
Mom? Can we make taffy?

01:07:06.534 --> 01:07:09.038
- Taffy?
- Tomorrow. For my party.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.107
There may only be six of us,
but who cares?

01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:13.541
And you're totally coming,
right? You have to.

01:07:13.575 --> 01:07:15.677
- Well, I don't...
- Mom? Tell him he has to.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:17.445
I don't know
what we're talking about.

01:07:17.479 --> 01:07:18.680
You better be there.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:22.952
What did you do?

01:07:25.254 --> 01:07:26.188
No clue.

01:07:27.089 --> 01:07:28.423
Yeah, right.

01:07:31.593 --> 01:07:33.695
Well, I'm just going
to finish cleaning up

01:07:33.728 --> 01:07:35.697
and, uh,
I will get out of your hair.

01:07:54.849 --> 01:07:55.817
Bray?

01:08:01.924 --> 01:08:04.492
I don't understand
what's happening here.

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:08.463
What do you mean?

01:08:09.065 --> 01:08:11.466
Well, I'm just... I don't know.
I'm... I'm...

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:17.471
I'm having a hard time believing
that all of this is...

01:08:18.773 --> 01:08:19.774
any better.

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.613
I guess I just have been...

01:08:27.883 --> 01:08:29.952
worried for so long
that maybe I don't know

01:08:29.986 --> 01:08:32.154
how to be happy anymore.

01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.723
- Hey.
- No. It's...

01:08:34.924 --> 01:08:36.491
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:37.259 --> 01:08:39.228
It's fine. I'm fine. It's...

01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:41.029
Just ignore me.

01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:43.265
Look, there is...

01:08:43.631 --> 01:08:46.568
something I keep meaning
to talk to you about.

01:08:47.103 --> 01:08:48.703
Just come to the party.

01:08:52.274 --> 01:08:53.274
Please.

01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:57.779
I mean, you're kind of the eye
of the storm here anyway.

01:09:02.051 --> 01:09:03.051
All right.

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:07.122
All right.

01:09:15.965 --> 01:09:17.732
What you doing, Nana?

01:09:18.234 --> 01:09:20.269
Just keeping an eye
on your mother.

01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:21.237
How come?

01:09:22.138 --> 01:09:24.706
That's what you do
when you love someone.

01:09:26.008 --> 01:09:28.542
Then I'm gonna watch you
watch them.

01:09:29.979 --> 01:09:32.148
Oh, I'm all done watching.

01:09:39.255 --> 01:09:42.058
Oh.
Let me see.

01:09:42.957 --> 01:09:43.792
Oh!

01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:46.228
Looks the same
as it did last night.

01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:48.729
You are a very lucky girl.

01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:51.133
Aren't I just?

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:53.768
Not many men would be willing
to take on somebody

01:09:53.801 --> 01:09:54.937
with your baggage.

01:09:55.971 --> 01:09:58.107
That's an awful thing to say.

01:09:58.374 --> 01:10:00.675
Why? It's true.

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:03.645
I mean, three kids,
a mountain of debt.

01:10:04.413 --> 01:10:05.780
It's not a mountain.

01:10:06.048 --> 01:10:07.883
Well, it's not
a molehill either.

01:10:08.817 --> 01:10:11.786
You make me sound like
some sort of charity case.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.322
I just don't want you to...

01:10:14.656 --> 01:10:15.958
Oh, forget it.

01:10:17.692 --> 01:10:18.693
No.

01:10:19.261 --> 01:10:20.262
What?

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:23.731
Blow this.

01:10:27.869 --> 01:10:29.871
I have been engaged

01:10:29.905 --> 01:10:33.042
a whole twelve hours
and already...

01:10:35.111 --> 01:10:37.679
Aren't you tired
of living under a cloud?

01:10:38.914 --> 01:10:41.683
Nobody ever said
that life was easy.

01:10:44.086 --> 01:10:46.322
I don't want it to be easy.

01:10:46.721 --> 01:10:49.024
But I do want it to be worth it.

01:10:56.265 --> 01:10:57.266
Bobby...

01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:01.170
when are you going to stop
making everything

01:11:01.203 --> 01:11:04.073
about loss and fear,

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.709
rather than gain and joy?

01:11:08.477 --> 01:11:10.645
Mom!
Come see what I built!

01:11:15.951 --> 01:11:17.353
- Taffy?
- Yeah.

01:11:17.386 --> 01:11:19.955
It's gonna get messy,
so don't wear anything too nice.

01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:21.190
Where is this coming from?

01:11:21.457 --> 01:11:23.825
Oh, Bray got her talking
and she realized

01:11:23.858 --> 01:11:25.895
that she just really
wants to have fun.

01:11:25.928 --> 01:11:27.695
He's gone, right?

01:11:27.729 --> 01:11:30.865
Yeah. No.
She invited him, so...

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.202
To a children's birthday party?
Dressed as what? A clown?

01:11:33.235 --> 01:11:34.869
That wasn't very nice.

01:11:34.904 --> 01:11:37.206
It wasn't meant to be.
I think it's weird.

01:11:37.672 --> 01:11:40.876
He helped me, he helped Greg,
he helped Missy.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.379
Now he's helping himself
to my fiancÃ©e.

01:11:45.014 --> 01:11:46.315
You're being ridiculous.

01:11:47.116 --> 01:11:48.117
Am I?

01:11:48.683 --> 01:11:51.320
He's a family friend,
and he's coming to the party.

01:11:51.353 --> 01:11:52.687
Get over it.

01:12:06.202 --> 01:12:08.304
<i>Engine failure.</i>

01:12:08.337 --> 01:12:10.239
<i>Losing altitude.
Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

01:12:31.826 --> 01:12:33.162
Help!

01:12:41.503 --> 01:12:43.771
Hey! This guy's alive!

01:12:52.314 --> 01:12:54.083
Morning, Mr. Johnson.

01:12:54.516 --> 01:12:56.085
This just arrived for you.

01:12:56.751 --> 01:12:59.021
Ah, yeah.
Thank you very much, Sloane.

01:12:59.054 --> 01:13:01.223
And I printed out
those documents you wanted.

01:13:01.257 --> 01:13:02.157
Excellent.

01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:04.560
Would you possibly have
a manila envelope

01:13:04.593 --> 01:13:07.162
- and a pen I could borrow?
- Sure thing.

01:13:52.341 --> 01:13:53.841
Next time I ask for a party,

01:13:53.876 --> 01:13:55.978
you have permission
to ground me for life!

01:14:06.588 --> 01:14:07.556
Huh?

01:14:14.663 --> 01:14:16.465
I just thought it'd be nice
to show off

01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:19.234
the whole new family, you know.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.639
Okay! Lights are up.
Banner is hung. What else?

01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:27.276
Oh. Um... the taffy
pull needs to go outside.

01:14:27.309 --> 01:14:29.378
- You got it.
- Thank you.

01:14:29.745 --> 01:14:32.314
So? What's the deal with Bray?

01:14:33.015 --> 01:14:34.083
He's hot.

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:36.218
So, does he have a girlfriend,
or what?

01:14:36.652 --> 01:14:38.187
I'm pretty sure he's single.

01:14:39.254 --> 01:14:41.557
Oh. Well, I think
I'll just go see

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:44.193
if he needs some help
with the fire.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:56.338
Oh, no! They're here!

01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:59.274
It's too early.
Pretend I'm not here!

01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:00.342
I'm not here!

01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:06.415
Hi, girls! Welcome!

01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:09.017
Honey, your friends are here!

01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:11.086
<i>What did I just say?</i>

01:15:19.595 --> 01:15:21.497
- Are you thirsty?
- Yeah. Thank you.

01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:22.564
Yeah.

01:15:25.701 --> 01:15:27.269
Like this, Mommy?

01:15:27.302 --> 01:15:29.571
Yes, Bessie, that's perfect.
Just make sure

01:15:29.605 --> 01:15:31.540
you keep it
over the wax paper, okay?

01:15:32.374 --> 01:15:34.443
Who knew taffy
was such hard work?

01:15:34.476 --> 01:15:35.377
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:37.579
Mom keeps her own stash
in the glove box.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.682
Which I noticed
is getting smaller and smaller.

01:15:40.716 --> 01:15:41.950
You snooze, you lose.

01:15:42.418 --> 01:15:43.986
I remember this candy store

01:15:44.019 --> 01:15:45.621
right by LSU
that I discovered back

01:15:45.654 --> 01:15:47.222
when I was gonna be a nurse.

01:15:47.456 --> 01:15:49.525
You? A nurse? No way.

01:15:49.558 --> 01:15:51.727
You mean,
was I actually a human being

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.362
before I became a mother?

01:15:53.996 --> 01:15:54.696
Yes.

01:15:54.963 --> 01:15:57.232
Soon to be again, I hope.

01:15:58.066 --> 01:15:59.134
Wait, what?

01:16:00.702 --> 01:16:02.304
Miranda?

01:16:03.205 --> 01:16:05.641
Could I talk to you inside
for a moment?

01:16:05.874 --> 01:16:08.444
Sure.
Back in a flash.

01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:15.951
I wanna show you this.

01:16:16.652 --> 01:16:18.353
What am I looking at?

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:21.757
"A sensor identifies
and redistributes

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.026
wasted energy into a grid

01:16:24.059 --> 01:16:28.230
that can reassign
the loss into a gain."

01:16:28.564 --> 01:16:30.232
Does that sound familiar?

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.302
It sounds like
one of Matty's projects.

01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:36.071
- Honey, this is Matty's project.
- Bobby.

01:16:36.104 --> 01:16:39.041
Saving energy's not a new thing.

01:16:39.074 --> 01:16:41.977
He called you from the hotel.
He told you he met a fellow

01:16:42.177 --> 01:16:44.112
- inventor...
- Matt wanted to take the heat

01:16:44.146 --> 01:16:46.215
- from the house and make it...
- ...who wanted to introduce him

01:16:46.248 --> 01:16:47.683
- to some people.
- ...into air conditioning.

01:16:47.716 --> 01:16:49.485
- It's not like he had a patent.
- And that is why

01:16:49.518 --> 01:16:50.752
he got on the damn plane!

01:16:50.786 --> 01:16:53.455
So somebody else
came up with it. So what?

01:16:53.489 --> 01:16:55.757
Well, not somebody.
Bray!

01:16:58.393 --> 01:17:00.796
Next time, you might wanna
Google a man you run into.

01:17:00.829 --> 01:17:02.498
That was page two!

01:17:05.167 --> 01:17:06.401
I don't understand.

01:17:06.435 --> 01:17:09.304
Your handyman
was at the same convention!

01:17:10.572 --> 01:17:12.774
This is who Matty
was talking about.

01:17:12.808 --> 01:17:15.477
That's the thief
that stole my son's invention!

01:17:15.511 --> 01:17:16.545
You don't know that!

01:17:16.745 --> 01:17:18.547
Oh, no? Well, ask him.

01:17:30.626 --> 01:17:31.693
Bray?

01:17:33.695 --> 01:17:35.097
Is this what I think it is?

01:17:36.798 --> 01:17:38.767
- Miranda...
- Answer the question.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.402
- Yes, but...
- Did you know Matthew?

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.175
- Yes, I...
- How dare you?

01:17:47.776 --> 01:17:49.545
What the hell is going on?

01:17:49.745 --> 01:17:51.413
Tuck, stay out of this.

01:17:53.448 --> 01:17:54.316
I'm sorry.

01:17:54.349 --> 01:17:56.218
- I should've never...
- Sorry about what?

01:17:57.252 --> 01:17:58.720
For lying to my face?

01:17:58.754 --> 01:18:01.723
Or stealing a dead man's idea
and selling it as your own?

01:18:01.757 --> 01:18:03.125
- Oh, whoa, no.
- "Maybe I'll just check

01:18:03.158 --> 01:18:04.593
on the widow,
see how she's doing!"

01:18:04.626 --> 01:18:07.162
- How creepy is that?
- I didn't steal Matt's idea!

01:18:07.195 --> 01:18:08.363
You need to leave!

01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:11.500
Just give me a second.
We met in Vegas.

01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:14.269
I had developed this
Grey Water Reclamation System,

01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:16.471
and he had this sensor,
which was really smart.

01:18:16.505 --> 01:18:18.874
And he showed it to me.
But sometimes it didn't work.

01:18:18.908 --> 01:18:20.609
So he asked me for my advice.

01:18:20.642 --> 01:18:23.111
We started kicking ideas around
and then suddenly,

01:18:23.145 --> 01:18:25.814
out of the blue,
we came up with this energy grid

01:18:25.847 --> 01:18:28.517
- for office buildings that was...
- And then he died!

01:18:31.219 --> 01:18:32.254
Yes.

01:18:32.287 --> 01:18:33.522
And where were you?

01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:37.793
Sitting right next to him.

01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:43.832
You...

01:18:45.902 --> 01:18:47.135
You?

01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:52.307
The guy who survived.

01:18:58.513 --> 01:19:01.450
Because of a miracle
that not only saved my life,

01:19:01.483 --> 01:19:03.585
but changed everything about it.

01:19:13.328 --> 01:19:14.830
So, you're the guy they found?

01:19:16.298 --> 01:19:18.266
You've got some nerve.

01:19:20.636 --> 01:19:22.404
Miranda, the patent
just cleared last month.

01:19:22.437 --> 01:19:24.573
I brought you the papers
as soon as I had them.

01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:28.644
Then the storm came
and you just...

01:19:29.745 --> 01:19:31.313
You seemed so...

01:19:32.748 --> 01:19:36.251
Frail and helpless?
Is that what you think of me?

01:19:36.284 --> 01:19:37.619
No. Far from it.

01:19:37.653 --> 01:19:39.855
I don't need anyone to fix me.

01:19:43.859 --> 01:19:45.794
I thought that
if I could just show yo...

01:19:45.995 --> 01:19:47.663
You just need to go!

01:19:49.231 --> 01:19:51.299
You just need
to get the hell out!

01:20:02.979 --> 01:20:05.915
You heard the woman.
You gotta go.

01:20:32.674 --> 01:20:34.342
Are you checking out?

01:20:34.743 --> 01:20:35.744
Yep.

01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:38.948
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to charge you for the night.

01:20:38.981 --> 01:20:41.516
Oh, I understand.
Keep it on the same card?

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:42.584
Please.

01:20:42.617 --> 01:20:44.720
Oh, and would you have
a messenger

01:20:44.753 --> 01:20:46.588
deliver that tomorrow morning?

01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:48.991
And you can go ahead
and charge that to my room too?

01:20:49.025 --> 01:20:51.526
- Sure.
- Good luck with the LSAT.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.528
Thanks. I'll need it.

01:20:59.035 --> 01:21:00.535
Let me ask you something.

01:21:03.538 --> 01:21:05.807
Can you see yourself
being a lawyer?

01:21:10.512 --> 01:21:12.748
Yeah. Definitely.

01:21:13.782 --> 01:21:15.484
Then so can I.

01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:32.667
<i>Mom!</i>

01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:35.303
<i>There's a girl here
with a package!</i>

01:21:36.805 --> 01:21:39.008
He was so nice I figured
why make him pay for a messenger

01:21:39.041 --> 01:21:41.543
when I live, like,
five minutes from here.

01:21:43.913 --> 01:21:46.348
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good day.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.721
That from Bray?

01:21:53.655 --> 01:21:54.756
Yeah.

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:56.525
Well, finally.

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.296
- What do you mean?
- He had that with him the day

01:22:01.596 --> 01:22:03.799
I stayed home from school.
I thought he was from the bank.

01:22:03.832 --> 01:22:05.968
Greg,
why didn't you say anything?

01:22:06.002 --> 01:22:08.570
I'm not supposed to talk
to strangers, remember?

01:22:48.978 --> 01:22:50.079
First of all,

01:22:50.712 --> 01:22:54.150
you need to know that
one of your dad's inventions

01:22:54.183 --> 01:22:57.053
sold for a great deal of money.

01:22:57.086 --> 01:22:59.688
Apparently, it could be
the first check of many.

01:22:59.989 --> 01:23:03.558
And I couldn't be
more proud of him.

01:23:03.825 --> 01:23:05.827
Am I getting a pony?

01:23:06.628 --> 01:23:07.629
No, baby.

01:23:08.998 --> 01:23:12.400
But we do need to talk
about the future.

01:23:15.637 --> 01:23:17.439
Okay, um...

01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:20.508
Let me back up a little bit,
um...

01:23:20.809 --> 01:23:22.711
I was caught off guard
the other night

01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:24.113
when Tucker proposed.

01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:27.649
Most people prefer that sort
of thing be done in private,

01:23:27.682 --> 01:23:30.186
because it's a big deal
and very intimate.

01:23:30.219 --> 01:23:33.755
And I think he was afraid
I might say no,

01:23:33.788 --> 01:23:38.094
and so he hedged his bet
a little by doing it in public.

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:40.862
But the truth is,
I should've discussed it

01:23:40.897 --> 01:23:43.798
with you guys first,
because it affects everybody.

01:23:43.832 --> 01:23:45.433
It's not just about me.

01:23:46.302 --> 01:23:48.603
You're the one
who has to sleep with him.

01:23:48.905 --> 01:23:51.806
Well, that's not the point,
but thank you for that.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.841
No.

01:23:53.309 --> 01:23:56.645
The point is,
what do you want, Mom?

01:24:00.782 --> 01:24:02.051
I don't know.

01:24:03.019 --> 01:24:04.753
Well, if you don't know,

01:24:04.786 --> 01:24:06.554
how are you supposed
to ask for it?

01:24:14.829 --> 01:24:17.432
I guess I should figure
that out, shouldn't I?

01:24:19.567 --> 01:24:20.970
Can I go back to bed now?

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:23.505
Absolutely.

01:24:24.206 --> 01:24:25.874
Unless you wanna go
to the Apple store

01:24:25.908 --> 01:24:27.076
and look at a new computer.

01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:29.045
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:30.246 --> 01:24:32.048
It's still
your birthday weekend.

01:24:32.248 --> 01:24:33.748
Oh.

01:24:34.683 --> 01:24:35.985
Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:39.554 --> 01:24:41.623
It's a half hour wait.
We don't have to stay.

01:24:41.991 --> 01:24:43.259
I just thought it'd be fun
for you

01:24:43.292 --> 01:24:44.927
to see where Mom
used to waitress.

01:24:45.962 --> 01:24:47.229
We can go. Come on.

01:24:48.164 --> 01:24:50.832
Maybe we should just
skip lunch and have ice cream?

01:24:50.865 --> 01:24:52.667
- Yay, ice cream!
- Dude? We're leaving.

01:24:53.735 --> 01:24:56.973
Bray told me a running back
once said that before the snap,

01:24:57.006 --> 01:24:59.241
he can see the exact hole
he's gonna run through.

01:24:59.275 --> 01:25:00.409
And then he trusts.

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:03.578
He believes that his guys
are gonna make their blocks.

01:25:04.246 --> 01:25:06.748
- And sure enough...
- Okay, cowboy. Come on.

01:25:09.085 --> 01:25:10.920
Miranda? Party of four?

01:25:11.253 --> 01:25:13.189
I thought
it was a half an hour wait.

01:25:13.222 --> 01:25:16.225
Well, the dad forgot his wallet,
so they left.

01:25:17.226 --> 01:25:18.593
Touchdown! All right.

01:25:18.626 --> 01:25:20.129
Right this way, guys.

01:25:22.831 --> 01:25:25.034
Mom, stop the car!
Stop the car! Stop the car!

01:25:29.704 --> 01:25:31.107
What? What is it?

01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.241
It's our mailbox!

01:25:32.274 --> 01:25:34.676
- Holy crap!
- Missy!

01:25:42.051 --> 01:25:43.152
Wow.

01:25:53.896 --> 01:25:55.031
What's it say?

01:25:56.765 --> 01:25:58.167
"Miranda,
I should've said something

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.169
about all this the moment
I realized who you were,

01:26:00.202 --> 01:26:01.803
and I feel really bad I didn't.

01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:04.240
I only knew Matt a few days.

01:26:04.672 --> 01:26:07.575
He was a special man
who loved his family dearly."

01:26:42.844 --> 01:26:46.115
Oh! I can't believe I have
to go back to work tomorrow.

01:26:47.249 --> 01:26:49.218
Oh, that's what Mondays are for.

01:26:49.684 --> 01:26:51.253
How long was I out?

01:26:51.753 --> 01:26:54.056
Well, long enough for me
to finish the dishes.

01:26:54.457 --> 01:26:56.225
You've got it down to a science.

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:05.633
Bessie?

01:27:06.835 --> 01:27:07.802
What happened?

01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:11.840
I was trying to glue
her tail back on and it slipped.

01:27:11.873 --> 01:27:13.775
Now she's really dead.

01:27:13.808 --> 01:27:16.078
And my fingers are stuck
together forever!

01:27:16.112 --> 01:27:18.047
Oh, no, not forever, sweetie.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.015
We just need a little
nail polish remover, okay?

01:27:20.049 --> 01:27:21.150
Come on.

01:27:21.683 --> 01:27:23.352
But what about Beauty?

01:27:23.718 --> 01:27:25.354
Well, we'll ask your brother.

01:27:25.387 --> 01:27:28.390
But, you know, we might have
to get a new horse.

01:27:30.025 --> 01:27:31.193
It's okay, sweetie.

01:27:40.269 --> 01:27:42.371
- Dead pony?
- Yep.

01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:48.177
Remember when I stuck
a kernel of corn up my nose?

01:27:49.844 --> 01:27:51.947
Yes. And you were terrified
an ear of corn

01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:53.983
was gonna sprout
out of your face.

01:27:54.416 --> 01:27:55.750
What brought that up?

01:27:56.218 --> 01:27:57.286
I don't know.

01:27:57.319 --> 01:27:59.787
Thinking about Bessie
and how when you're younger

01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:01.924
everything seems
so life and death.

01:28:05.461 --> 01:28:06.661
You okay?

01:28:09.431 --> 01:28:11.766
- Did something happen?
- No.

01:28:13.302 --> 01:28:15.070
I just never
would have thought...

01:28:16.505 --> 01:28:18.073
I don't know what I'm saying.

01:28:18.607 --> 01:28:21.676
Yes, you do.
Just finish that sentence.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.181
Bray.

01:28:30.519 --> 01:28:31.887
What about him?

01:28:32.888 --> 01:28:35.690
I never would've thought
of taffy if it weren't for him.

01:28:36.858 --> 01:28:39.727
He just made everything lighter.

01:28:40.896 --> 01:28:42.864
I mean,
look at that skylight.

01:28:42.898 --> 01:28:45.067
It's totally
<i>Goodnight Moon</i> in here.

01:28:52.308 --> 01:28:53.876
You're quite a kid,
you know that?

01:28:56.912 --> 01:28:58.047
Have you called him?

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:03.485
- No.
- Why not?

01:29:03.851 --> 01:29:06.288
Mom, he's everything
he said he was.

01:29:06.322 --> 01:29:09.757
He just couldn't get out
of his own way is all.

01:29:10.192 --> 01:29:12.294
And the sibs and I
were talking.

01:29:12.727 --> 01:29:14.862
You were so much more relaxed
with him.

01:29:20.135 --> 01:29:23.105
- Do your homework.
- What? You were.

01:29:23.138 --> 01:29:24.240
Honey...

01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:26.976
I barely know the man.

01:29:27.643 --> 01:29:30.212
But you liked what you knew.

01:29:41.056 --> 01:29:44.994
Now we turn to deriving
an equation of motion

01:29:45.494 --> 01:29:47.129
from all of these ingredients.

01:29:47.663 --> 01:29:50.366
<i>So let's consider
an extremum principle</i>

01:29:50.633 --> 01:29:53.435
<i>for the motion
of a mechanical system.</i>

01:29:56.038 --> 01:29:58.941
<i>What if we used the system
of an "N" particle,</i>

01:29:59.408 --> 01:30:03.912
subject to active forces F-I
and constrained forces K-I?

01:30:09.885 --> 01:30:12.321
So, what happens
when we add motion

01:30:13.489 --> 01:30:15.391
to a structured system
like that?

01:30:25.367 --> 01:30:26.902
Hey, sweetheart.

01:30:33.509 --> 01:30:35.577
Thank you
for our beautiful kids.

01:30:36.645 --> 01:30:40.082
I wish you could have seen
their faces when I told them.

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:49.992
You are their hero.

01:30:52.928 --> 01:30:54.163
And mine too.

01:31:10.412 --> 01:31:13.282
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:31:13.682 --> 01:31:15.451
I thought you had
a dentist appointment.

01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:18.887
I did.

01:31:20.923 --> 01:31:22.891
Oh, great!
No more pain?

01:31:39.708 --> 01:31:41.210
I'm sorry, Tuck.

01:31:42.344 --> 01:31:43.545
I can't do this.

01:31:52.121 --> 01:31:53.122
Yeah.

01:31:57.092 --> 01:31:58.093
Okay.

01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:03.132
Don't you wanna yell at me
or something?

01:32:07.236 --> 01:32:08.570
Would it change your mind?

01:32:14.710 --> 01:32:15.911
No.

01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:21.583
But I think you're wonderful.

01:32:25.621 --> 01:32:26.688
Right back at you.

01:32:35.998 --> 01:32:37.399
I should probably quit.

01:32:39.034 --> 01:32:40.135
Yeah.

01:32:43.071 --> 01:32:44.173
Thank you.

01:33:00.389 --> 01:33:03.058
<i>It was all right there
in the mailbox.</i>

01:33:03.425 --> 01:33:05.227
Bray made Matt
co-owner of the patent,

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:08.096
even though it took him
another two years to perfect it.

01:33:08.297 --> 01:33:10.399
Well, I still think
he should've said something.

01:33:10.432 --> 01:33:11.433
I know.

01:33:13.101 --> 01:33:14.102
He tried.

01:33:15.504 --> 01:33:17.973
Which reminds me, um...

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:23.278
I broke up with Tucker.

01:33:23.312 --> 01:33:24.713
What? Why?

01:33:27.449 --> 01:33:28.717
Because I don't love him.

01:33:31.587 --> 01:33:33.121
And I'm gonna go back to school.

01:33:33.655 --> 01:33:35.290
What on earth for?

01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:37.192
To continue my life.

01:33:38.427 --> 01:33:40.262
I was gonna be a nurse.

01:33:40.829 --> 01:33:43.532
- Remember?
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:43.967 --> 01:33:46.535
And I was wondering,
if it's not too much to ask,

01:33:46.568 --> 01:33:48.670
if you could babysit the kids
this weekend?

01:33:49.838 --> 01:33:51.139
This weekend?

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.709
They don't know it yet, but...

01:33:54.911 --> 01:33:59.348
I'm going on a little road trip
to check out some grad programs.

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:07.389
Look, I know
that you probably think

01:34:07.422 --> 01:34:11.126
this whole second chance thing
is stupid.

01:34:13.595 --> 01:34:15.197
You'd be wrong.

01:35:54.763 --> 01:35:55.764
Hi.

01:35:56.498 --> 01:35:57.866
Hi, um...

01:35:59.267 --> 01:36:00.535
I'm looking for Bray.

01:36:00.569 --> 01:36:03.171
Oh, I'm afraid he's not here.

01:36:03.205 --> 01:36:06.675
He had to take care
of some business out of town.

01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:09.344
Would you like
to leave a message?

01:36:09.711 --> 01:36:11.313
Oh, um...

01:36:12.547 --> 01:36:14.149
No.

01:36:15.384 --> 01:36:17.719
I was just in town
and thought...

01:36:19.922 --> 01:36:21.390
Um, actually,

01:36:21.657 --> 01:36:23.759
could you tell him Miranda Wells
stopped by?

01:36:24.459 --> 01:36:26.395
You're Miranda?

01:36:26.795 --> 01:36:28.630
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh!

01:36:28.664 --> 01:36:30.532
You're the reason he's not here!

01:36:30.565 --> 01:36:34.336
I'm his sister, Jennifer.
I've heard so much about you!

01:36:34.369 --> 01:36:36.672
- You have?
- Yes! And...

01:36:36.872 --> 01:36:40.442
he's probably knocking
on your front door right now.

01:36:40.475 --> 01:36:42.477
- Come on, Nana!
- All right, okay.

01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:44.379
Oh, my gosh, you're doing it.

01:36:44.413 --> 01:36:45.781
Oh, you see that?
You see that?

01:36:45.814 --> 01:36:47.749
What am I hearing in my house?

01:36:48.684 --> 01:36:50.452
Are we expecting anybody?

01:36:54.556 --> 01:36:56.491
<i>You should have seen my face</i>

01:36:56.525 --> 01:36:58.794
when your sister
opened the door.

01:36:58.827 --> 01:37:01.263
It couldn't have been
any worse than mine

01:37:01.296 --> 01:37:02.831
when Bobby answered yours.

01:37:03.099 --> 01:37:05.500
Yeah. Okay. You win.

01:37:06.002 --> 01:37:09.404
But, in a way,
it all kind of worked out.

01:37:09.438 --> 01:37:11.606
She and I got to clear
the air about, you know,

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.608
pretty much everything, really.

01:37:13.642 --> 01:37:16.311
And your sister and I
got to talk about nursing.

01:37:16.344 --> 01:37:17.914
<i>Hey, I don't mean to be biased,</i>

01:37:18.181 --> 01:37:21.683
but, uh, I hear Vanderbilt's
got a pretty good program.

01:37:25.353 --> 01:37:26.889
Where are you right now?

01:37:27.422 --> 01:37:32.461
Um, headed north on the 59. You?

01:37:33.628 --> 01:37:35.630
I'm heading south on the 65.

01:37:37.033 --> 01:37:39.601
Just two ships passing
in the night, huh?

01:37:39.634 --> 01:37:42.637
Well, unless they wanna stop
for a coffee somewhere.

01:37:42.671 --> 01:37:45.574
And maybe grab a waffle?

01:37:47.476 --> 01:37:48.610
You like waffles?

01:37:48.643 --> 01:37:51.413
Oh, yeah.
I particularly like the ones

01:37:51.446 --> 01:37:54.016
just off exit 47
near Tuscaloosa,

01:37:54.816 --> 01:37:56.852
which we both should be
reaching,

01:37:57.652 --> 01:37:59.354
what, about sun-up?

01:38:03.792 --> 01:38:04.793
Well...

01:38:05.494 --> 01:38:07.897
what's a couple more hours
when it's taken me this long

01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:10.967
to realize I can have
anything I want?

01:38:14.402 --> 01:38:15.704
Then don't hang up.

01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:22.410
Are you on the right street?

01:38:23.678 --> 01:38:24.981
Oh, I see you.

01:39:05.387 --> 01:39:07.522
- You look great.
- So do you.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:12.861
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:39:28.743 --> 01:39:29.879
So, uh...

01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:24.166
Mom, where'd Bray go?

01:40:24.766 --> 01:40:28.070
Oh, he got a call
from Eric Carlson up the road.

01:40:28.104 --> 01:40:29.972
Said he was having trouble
with his barn.

01:40:30.639 --> 01:40:33.042
Nana, I think we need
some more ornaments up here.

01:40:33.376 --> 01:40:34.743
Oh, on that side?

01:40:34.776 --> 01:40:36.078
Yes.
I can see this one.

01:40:45.254 --> 01:40:47.822
Mommy! Look! It's a pony!

01:40:48.224 --> 01:40:49.926
Thank you so much, Bray.

01:40:50.226 --> 01:40:51.660
Imagine that?

01:40:54.997 --> 01:40:57.499
- Say hi?
- Hi!

01:41:00.635 --> 01:41:02.504
That's so cute.
