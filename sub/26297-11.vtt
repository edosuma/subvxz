WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:03.003
ADULT ADAM: Ah, the weddings of the '80s.

00:03.090 --> 00:05.092
It was a night filled
with frilly dresses,

00:05.179 --> 00:06.571
mustachioed bandleaders,

00:06.658 --> 00:08.356
and embarrassing uncles
on the dance floor.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.835
That's why I couldn't wait

00:09.922 --> 00:11.794
for my brother to get married to Lainey Lewis.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.405
We're getting married!
Whoo!

00:14.492 --> 00:16.625
ADULT ADAM: And in my house,
it was all wedding,
all the time.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.235
There she is,

00:18.322 --> 00:19.758
the woman
who made the little devil

00:19.845 --> 00:21.325
who's taking my angel.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.848
And there's the man
who once broke

00:22.935 --> 00:25.895
one of our dining room chairs
'cause he sat down too fast.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.899
You know, I know the bride's
side always does the planning,

00:29.986 --> 00:31.770
but now that
they picked a date
and it's coming fast,

00:31.857 --> 00:33.772
I thought I would
just check in,
make sure I'm on track.

00:33.859 --> 00:34.947
Smart.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.298
So, tell me
about the florist.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.690
Can't,
'cause there ain't one.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.257
You've at least booked
a wedding singer, right?

00:40.344 --> 00:41.780
Strike two!

00:41.867 --> 00:42.607
Please tell me
you booked a venue.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.566
Of course.

00:44.653 --> 00:46.655
I'm deciding between
the parking lot
of my tile store

00:46.742 --> 00:49.571
or nothing,
'cause there is no venue.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.095
ADULT ADAM: And so my mom
sprang into action
and selflessly planned

00:52.182 --> 00:54.445
the dream wedding
she always wanted.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.230
What the hell
is all this?

00:56.317 --> 00:58.014
Groom in the room!
Everybody cover up!

00:58.101 --> 01:00.016
This is not a drill!

01:00.103 --> 01:02.540
Welcome to Wedding HQ.
Don't look at
or touch anything.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.238
I want it to
be a surprise
on your big day.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.804
Mom's sparing no expense,

01:05.891 --> 01:07.676
so Dad will definitely
not be able to retire.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.286
It's scary
and hilarious.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.592
We just finished
our cake tasting,

01:10.679 --> 01:12.289
and this is the one
you like best.

01:12.376 --> 01:15.118
Why the hell is there
a middle-aged blonde lady

01:15.205 --> 01:17.251
between the bride and groom
on my cake topper?

01:17.338 --> 01:18.426
I think
you know why, pal.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.297
Mom,
this room is crazy!

01:20.384 --> 01:21.907
This is all
way too much.

01:21.994 --> 01:24.649
Nothing is too much
for my curly-haired groom.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.608
Which we're going
to feather back
on the wedding day

01:26.695 --> 01:29.828
to make you look just like
a masculine Farrah Fawcett.

01:29.915 --> 01:33.049
I told you, me and Lainey
just want a small wedding

01:33.136 --> 01:34.659
with a deejay
and spaghetti bar.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.705
Well, when it's your wedding,
you can serve spaghetti.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.272
It is my wedding!

01:38.359 --> 01:40.535
Let me explain
exactly how this works.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.233
I know exactly what you want,
not you.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.539
How is that
even possible?

01:44.626 --> 01:47.063
See, your body
grew in my body,

01:47.150 --> 01:50.501
transferring all your thoughts
and choices into me.

01:50.588 --> 01:53.678
But I am me!
I know what me wants!

01:53.765 --> 01:56.377
No, I am you,
and you want what I want.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.595
That's ironclad logic
from where I sit.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.991
Man! This wedding's turning
into a whole thing, huh?

02:02.078 --> 02:03.862
Yeah,
'cause it's a wedding.

02:03.949 --> 02:06.430
You know, I had my doubts
this wildly misguided event

02:06.517 --> 02:07.866
would even happen,
but here we are.

02:07.953 --> 02:10.130
Seems that way,
but nah.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.393
"Nah," what?
"Nah" to getting married,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.438
'cause I'm making
a terrible mistake.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.838
ADULT ADAM:
It was January 9th,
1980-something,

02:22.925 --> 02:24.622
and I had a wedding proposal
of my own.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.842
My one and only business card,
fine sir.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.892
"$1,000 cash or equivalent
in Garbage Pail Kids."

02:33.979 --> 02:35.546
What's
a Garbage Pail Kid?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.592
It's baseball cards
for kids who hate baseball.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.942
Come on! Just hire me.
We're family.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.378
It's like the old saying...

02:41.465 --> 02:43.119
"Always do business
with family."

02:43.206 --> 02:44.338
How can you even ask me
to do this

02:44.425 --> 02:45.469
after what you did

02:45.556 --> 02:46.905
to cousin Susan's
wedding video?

02:46.992 --> 02:49.169
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.477
ADAM: Da party! Party!

02:53.564 --> 02:57.177
Starring Adam Goldberg
as the cameraman.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.004
Also starring Susan.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.136
Um, she's the bride.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.964
It's Beverly... my mom.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.403
Such good grub, man.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.839
That is why
I'm not hiring you.

03:07.926 --> 03:11.234
It's true. Itzel eats so loud.
He's the worst.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.628
Weddings are supposed
to be fancy and special,

03:13.715 --> 03:16.413
not a showcase for
your stupid brand of stupid.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.285
W... Wait, this is
a wedding video?

03:18.372 --> 03:20.939
No, no, Adam.
No, no.

03:21.026 --> 03:22.071
You're turning
on me, too?

03:22.158 --> 03:23.420
But you love
my schtick.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.770
A wedding is
a no-schtick zone!

03:25.857 --> 03:26.902
Oh, yeah?

03:26.989 --> 03:28.469
Well, when I become

03:28.556 --> 03:31.036
the most famous wedding
videographer in the world,

03:31.123 --> 03:34.257
you'll both regret this moment
as long as you live.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.346
I'm totally at peace
with this decision.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.653
ADULT ADAM:
While my dad and Pops
doubted my serious side,

03:38.740 --> 03:40.611
Barry was having serious
doubts about his wedding.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.873
I can't marry Lainey!

03:41.960 --> 03:43.875
I'm just a dumb kid!

03:43.962 --> 03:46.748
I still get super angry
when someone else gets a gift.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.532
The wedding
is weeks away,

03:48.619 --> 03:50.578
and you're just realizing
you're an idiot now?

03:50.665 --> 03:53.537
I always had a sense,
but now it's confirmed.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.800
All this wedding stuff
happened so fast,

03:55.887 --> 03:57.628
I just couldn't figure out
how to stop it.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.456
It happened fast
because you said,

03:59.543 --> 04:00.805
"Let's have
a fast wedding!"

04:00.892 --> 04:02.894
I only did that
'cause people said slow down.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.767
But you proposed
and insisted on doing this.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.465
That's only 'cause people
insisted I call it off.

04:08.552 --> 04:11.033
But you picked a random date
that was alarmingly close!

04:11.120 --> 04:12.817
That's 'cause people said
don't pick a date

04:12.904 --> 04:15.124
until you know
you're absolutely ready.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.908
I had no choice.
They boxed me in.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.693
Dude, this is exactly
why I told you

04:18.780 --> 04:21.565
to not get a crush on Lainey
or ask her out or date her

04:21.652 --> 04:23.567
or fall in love with her
or propose to her.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.569
Which is exactly why
I did all those things!

04:25.656 --> 04:27.267
Great, now you're gonna
devastate her

04:27.354 --> 04:28.703
and completely
ruin my life!

04:28.790 --> 04:30.270
I'm so sorry.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.923
I didn't know this wedding
was all about you.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.361
Of course it is.
Lainey is my best friend.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.450
I dropped out of college
to start a band with her.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.234
Now you're gonna
break her heart

04:38.321 --> 04:40.018
and drive her
straight out of town.

04:40.105 --> 04:43.152
You want me to get married
just to keep
your band together?

04:43.239 --> 04:44.327
Could you?
No!

04:44.414 --> 04:45.676
Well, then,
when you tell Lainey,

04:45.763 --> 04:47.417
I got to be there
to pick up the pieces.

04:47.504 --> 04:48.723
Ooh!

04:48.810 --> 04:50.246
Maybe we'll turn
her heartbreak

04:50.333 --> 04:51.813
into a hit song
about falling in love

04:51.900 --> 04:53.902
with a pasty sewer goblin
who broke her heart.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.469
I don't like that song.
It isn't about you.

04:55.556 --> 04:56.861
Now go break up
with your fiancee for me.

04:58.210 --> 04:59.864
BARRY: Lainey,
please don't cry.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.823
I love you
more than anything!

05:01.910 --> 05:03.825
Thank you so much
for pulling the plug!

05:03.912 --> 05:05.261
Oh, sweet Lord,
thank you.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.436
What?
Seriously?

05:06.523 --> 05:07.524
I mean, when you proposed
under the stars,

05:07.611 --> 05:09.309
it was super romantic,
and I was like,

05:09.396 --> 05:10.440
"Hell yeah,
let's do this."

05:10.527 --> 05:11.659
That's what I was like.

05:11.746 --> 05:12.834
But then everyone
said, like,

05:12.921 --> 05:14.357
"You're too young.
You can't do this."

05:14.444 --> 05:16.316
And I was like,
"Suck it, family and friends.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.882
I'll do it
just to show you I can!"

05:17.969 --> 05:19.710
That was exactly
my train of thought!

05:19.797 --> 05:21.451
But then everyone caved
and got on board,

05:21.538 --> 05:23.410
a...and it all
became too real,

05:23.497 --> 05:24.889
and I was hoping you'd pull
the plug, but you didn't,

05:24.976 --> 05:26.761
so I was like, "Oh, well,
this is my life, I guess."

05:26.848 --> 05:28.197
I was like that, too!

05:28.284 --> 05:29.546
I mean,
I was freaking out

05:29.633 --> 05:30.852
'cause marrying you
would for sure

05:30.939 --> 05:33.289
ruin my dream of becoming
a Hollywood rock superstar.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.204
And I thought you were
gonna hold me back

05:35.291 --> 05:36.945
from all
my hopes and dreams!

05:37.032 --> 05:38.990
Aw, babe! I love you so much
for not wanting to marry me.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.340
BARRY: Yes!

05:40.427 --> 05:42.124
ADULT ADAM: It was
the perfect un-proposal.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.734
Meanwhile, I needed
the perfect way

05:43.821 --> 05:44.866
to become a serious filmmaker.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.389
Hey, is your mom around?

05:46.476 --> 05:47.434
I just finished addressing
all the wedding invitations

05:47.521 --> 05:48.522
'cause she was scary.

05:48.609 --> 05:50.872
Wait,
you're super sensitive.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.003
I need to prove to my dad
that I can make

05:52.090 --> 05:53.483
a wedding video
filled with heart.

05:53.570 --> 05:54.571
Tell me what I need.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.791
Oh, man.
I freakin' love weddings.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.793
The vows, the toasts,

05:58.880 --> 06:01.012
the little flower girl
dancing on her daddy's shoes,

06:01.099 --> 06:02.884
the crusty, old
great-grandfather

06:02.971 --> 06:05.321
who willed himself
to stay alive just
to see the beautiful day.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.540
It's just too much, man!

06:06.627 --> 06:07.889
Interesting, interesting.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.892
Where do you land
on hilarious sound effects

06:10.979 --> 06:13.938
or frequent skits where
I play both Hans and Franz?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.158
Dude, the only funny thing
in a wedding video

06:16.245 --> 06:18.639
should be the groom
jamming a piece
of wedding cake

06:18.726 --> 06:19.944
into the bride's mouth
as she laughs,

06:20.031 --> 06:22.338
but we all know
that she is pissed!

06:22.425 --> 06:23.687
Then I got nothing.
I give up.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.036
You know
what your problem is?

06:25.123 --> 06:27.299
You're obsessed with
making everything funny.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.866
I mean, look at these posters.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.694
Your room's like a museum
for dumb comedy.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.740
Fine, Gene Shalit!
Then what should
I be watching?

06:32.827 --> 06:34.481
The classics
that have real characters

06:34.568 --> 06:35.960
and heart and drama.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.484
I... I mean,
look at this.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.702
You have a poster
for "Time Bandits"

06:38.789 --> 06:39.790
and not "The Godfather."

06:39.877 --> 06:41.444
Ugh. Not a fan.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.794
Not a fan of
the greatest movie
of all time?

06:43.881 --> 06:46.188
I mean, I heard good things,
so I gave it a shot, but woof.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.276
Total snoozefest.

06:47.363 --> 06:48.408
So you really
only watch comedies?

06:48.495 --> 06:49.844
That's what
you're saying?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.499
No! I also watch
sci-fi and horror

06:52.586 --> 06:55.415
and fantasy
and sci-fi horror fantasy

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
and anything set
at a wacky summer camp.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.940
Dude, let me
bottom-line this for you.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.029
Stop filming silly stuff
and just focus on the heart.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.726
That's it!
I'll go to the man

07:02.813 --> 07:04.249
who has more heart
than anyone I know.

07:04.336 --> 07:05.903
ADAM: Pops!

07:05.990 --> 07:08.036
Stop randomly pushing buttons.
I need your help.

07:08.123 --> 07:11.169
And I need your help
to heat up this matzo brei.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.476
Your mom made
too big of a batch,

07:13.563 --> 07:16.261
so I had her seal it
in a baggie
so I could freeze it...

07:16.348 --> 07:17.393
There's no time
to tell me

07:17.480 --> 07:19.351
the colorful history
of that matzo brei.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.918
I need a huge favor.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.617
Okay, but it's a great story
from pan to plate.

07:23.704 --> 07:24.879
Can you tell it fast?

07:24.966 --> 07:27.403
No! I need stories,
but not about matzo brei.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.970
You're gonna help me
prove to Dad

07:29.057 --> 07:30.362
that I can make
a heartfelt video.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.234
You want heartfelt?

07:32.321 --> 07:34.889
I'll make it so there wouldn't
be a dry eye in the house.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.020
Ooh!

07:36.107 --> 07:37.500
Oy.

07:37.587 --> 07:38.675
ADULT ADAM: As my serious
interview was on,

07:38.762 --> 07:40.547
Lainey's dad
had just been told

07:40.634 --> 07:41.983
the sad news
the wedding was off.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.681
Sweet Moses
on buttered toast!

07:44.768 --> 07:46.770
Miracles do happen!

07:46.857 --> 07:48.119
Maybe pull it back
a little, Dad.

07:48.206 --> 07:49.947
I can't help it.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.080
I'm just so glad you're not
throwing away your future

07:52.167 --> 07:54.299
on this boy-shaped
bag of cheese.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.040
That sounds like
it was at my expense.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.694
For sure, buddy.
This is going well.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.435
To be honest,
when I first met you,

07:59.522 --> 08:01.437
I was not a fan.

08:01.524 --> 08:02.438
And then I grew on you.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.570
You have not.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.919
But none of that
matters now,

08:05.006 --> 08:07.138
because you and I
are not gonna be family.

08:07.225 --> 08:07.965
Get in here.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.576
Oh!

08:09.663 --> 08:12.056
O-kay. We should
wrap this up.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.493
Time to go
break the news to Bev.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.059
Oh, you better hop to it.

08:15.146 --> 08:17.105
She left this morning
to hire you a wedding singer.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.759
Wedding singer?

08:18.846 --> 08:20.282
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, Mom schlepped
all the way to Jersey

08:20.369 --> 08:21.675
to hire the hottest
party entertainer around.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.814
ADULT ADAM:
Back then, there was
no better wedding singer

08:30.901 --> 08:32.250
than Robbie Hart.

08:34.165 --> 08:37.081
Holy God, this guy is
the best I've ever seen.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.346
♪ Mazel tov ♪

08:43.348 --> 08:44.045
Ya, ya, ya!
Ya, ya, ya!

08:44.132 --> 08:46.090
Oh, wow!

08:46.177 --> 08:47.265
Time to book me
a wedding singer.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.834
Eat ,
Charles and Diana.

08:50.921 --> 08:53.837
I'm throwing
the wedding of the century.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.273
ADULT ADAM:
In order to prove to my dad

08:55.360 --> 08:56.623
I could make
an emotional wedding video,

08:56.710 --> 09:00.191
I began shooting my first-ever serious interview.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.890
All right, Pops.
I need emotion and heart.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.456
Just look into the camera

09:04.544 --> 09:06.633
and tell Barry and Lainey
everything you feel.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.460
Everything?
Everything.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.375
Barry and Lainey,

09:10.462 --> 09:14.118
words can't describe
how I feel about you two.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.207
Makes me think back
to my own life.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.295
I had no parents.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.993
I had brothers who said,

09:19.080 --> 09:21.212
"If you get married,
we won't help you."

09:21.299 --> 09:23.693
I had a rare condition.

09:23.780 --> 09:27.784
My appendix burst inside
without causing me any pain.

09:27.871 --> 09:31.005
I have one large scar
across my abdomen

09:31.092 --> 09:34.574
and one scar
all the way down
my right side.

09:34.661 --> 09:38.578
And I had my kidney...
One of my kidneys removed.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.580
Can I erase that...
Erase about the kidney?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.451
That's all I have to say.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.887
Uh...

09:43.974 --> 09:45.410
Cut?

09:45.497 --> 09:47.151
That was fun.
How'd I do?

09:47.238 --> 09:48.283
We've had
a lot of fun here.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.415
Maybe too much.
Let's stop.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.896
Well, if you need
anything else,
just let me know.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.376
See you later, kiddo.

09:54.463 --> 09:55.638
Dude,
all you got to do

09:55.725 --> 09:57.553
is show this tale
of personal devastation

09:57.640 --> 09:59.076
to your dad,
and the gig is yours.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.991
You don't think I should
lighten it up a smidge?

10:01.078 --> 10:03.690
You know, cut in a rim shot
or slide whistle?

10:03.777 --> 10:04.778
Dig a few chuckles
out of it.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.606
Do not dig for chuckles!

10:06.693 --> 10:07.911
Here's what I'm thinking.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.044
Barry and Lainey,

10:10.131 --> 10:13.134
words can't describe
how I feel about you two.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.703
It just makes me burst.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.966
Your love is so special.

10:19.053 --> 10:22.273
So big.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.275
Thoughts?
You got serious
problems, man.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.799
Your grandfather
just bared his soul,

10:25.886 --> 10:27.191
and now you want
to fart it up?

10:27.278 --> 10:30.412
I can't help myself.
I can't not make
something funny.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.413
It's the only way
I can deal.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.067
Deal with what?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.025
With my life
in this ridiculous family

10:35.112 --> 10:37.680
and at school,
where I feel
anxious and awkward

10:37.767 --> 10:39.160
and desperately
try to fit in!

10:39.247 --> 10:41.249
And keyboard farts
help you fit in how?

10:41.336 --> 10:42.772
'Cause they make me happy.

10:42.859 --> 10:46.123
That's what big, funny movies
and TV shows do for me.

10:46.210 --> 10:50.780
They let me escape
and forget for
a few lousy hours

10:50.867 --> 10:54.044
that I'm lazy-eyed
Adam Goldnerd.

10:54.131 --> 10:56.046
Wow.
That's really deep, man.

10:56.133 --> 10:56.960
I had no idea.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.096
I think we both know
what has to happen now.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.314
No! D...
Don't do it, man!

11:03.401 --> 11:05.447
We connected!
You got deep!

11:16.763 --> 11:18.765
ADULT ADAM: While I bailed
on making serious videos,

11:18.852 --> 11:21.332
my mom was still
on a serious quest

11:21.419 --> 11:24.031
to book Robbie Hart,
no matter where he was.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.747
I'm sorry to just
barge in on you,

11:44.834 --> 11:46.923
but it's kind of my thing,
and this is really important.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.970
No bother.
It isladies' night,
after all.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.580
Even though it's lunchtime.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.929
What do you need?

11:53.016 --> 11:54.801
Well, my boy-king
is taking a shiksa bride,

11:54.888 --> 11:56.890
so I'm here to lock down
Robbie Hart.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.719
Robbie Hart?
Oh, God, no. He's lost it.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.982
Really? He was wonderful
at the Horowitz Bar Mitzvah.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.418
And that's all he books,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.376
ever since
he tried to strangle
the father of a bride

12:05.463 --> 12:06.290
with a microphone cord.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.770
Lucky for you,

12:07.857 --> 12:10.512
there's a new sheriff
in wedding town,

12:10.599 --> 12:12.166
and his name
is Jimmie Moore!

12:12.253 --> 12:14.690
Listen, you have
a real bullish tenacity

12:14.777 --> 12:16.344
that reminds me of me,

12:16.431 --> 12:18.041
but this wedding
has to be perfect for me...

12:18.128 --> 12:19.129
For them.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.565
And it will be.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.742
Seeing as I have
no other choice,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.004
I guess you're hired.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.527
I'll need a non-refundable
cash deposit.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.268
Consider it non-refundabled!

12:27.355 --> 12:28.704
Mom!
Barry!

12:28.791 --> 12:31.185
I just non-refundably booked
our wedding singer!

12:31.272 --> 12:32.839
About that... Barry has
something very important

12:32.926 --> 12:33.753
he'd like
to share with you.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.189
Barry, speak now.

12:35.276 --> 12:38.061
I just cannot wait
for this wedding.

12:38.148 --> 12:40.411
Lainey, anything
I'm leaving out
that you'd like to say?

12:40.498 --> 12:42.500
Only that
I'm equally excited.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.111
Barry, anything else
you want your mom to know?

12:44.198 --> 12:46.417
That I appreciate her
more than anything.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.593
Lainey, just tell her.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.335
I...can't wait
for you to be my mom.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.989
Oh! Jimmie!

12:53.076 --> 12:54.251
We'll see you
on the dance floor.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.644
Ohh!

12:55.731 --> 12:57.515
Oh, God.

12:57.602 --> 12:58.908
Now your mom just thinks
we totally love
and appreciate her!

12:58.995 --> 13:00.518
We made it so much worse!

13:00.605 --> 13:02.564
Please help us
not get married,
Mr. Wedding Singer.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.218
Well, kids,
I think we all know

13:04.305 --> 13:06.742
there's only
one mature option here.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.222
Go through
with the marriage

13:08.309 --> 13:10.180
and live a painful life
of what-ifs.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.835
This sleazy guy we just met
is right!

13:12.922 --> 13:15.011
There's no going back!
This is our life now!

13:15.098 --> 13:17.448
Let's get you
two lovebirds married.

13:17.535 --> 13:18.841
ADULT ADAM: But Lainey
didn't want that life,

13:18.928 --> 13:20.930
so she turned to a guy
she knew could bail her out.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.976
Hey, pal.
Gah!

13:23.063 --> 13:25.717
It's me... Lainey.
Yeah, I know.
W... What are you doing here?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.719
I need you to help me
make a goodbye video
to everyone I love,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.417
'cause I can't tell them
face-to-face

13:29.504 --> 13:31.071
that I'm getting
the hell out of here
and moving to L.A.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.463
So they have no idea?
None.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.291
My dad doesn't even know.
Why me?

13:34.378 --> 13:36.076
You're the one
who makes movies,
and this is

13:36.163 --> 13:38.208
the most serious,
important one
of your entire life.

13:38.295 --> 13:40.080
I really think
you got the wrong guy.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.169
Dude, all you do
is make videos
for your family.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.605
Now make one for me.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.693
Okay, then.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.825
Challenge accepted

13:45.912 --> 13:48.044
and most likely
not completed correctly.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.654
Hello,
everyone Lainey loves.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.787
Thanks for gathering
on such short notice.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.963
I've prepared a plate
of Teddy Grahams
and juice boxes.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.051
Boopie, hurry it up.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.836
The wedding's
less than two weeks away,

13:56.923 --> 13:58.576
and I still haven't booked
a swan wrangler.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.796
Yeah, I'd put a pin in that
till you watch the video.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.885
Mind you,
it's a bit heavy,

14:02.972 --> 14:05.018

Hey, guys.

Let me begin by saying
this is the hardest thing

14:28.345 --> 14:30.304
I've ever had to tell anyone.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.045
ADULT ADAM: Once again,
I couldn't handle

14:32.132 --> 14:33.350
filming all that emotion,

14:33.437 --> 14:35.309
so I added some laughs.
Literally.

a shot now,

you've put into this wedding,

14:44.013 --> 14:45.623
and all I can say is,
I'm sorry.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.758
Erica, I don't know what this means for our band,

14:49.845 --> 14:52.848
but I do know with your talent, there is nowhere you can't go.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.504
Dad, I know this is
one of my more crazy,
impulsive decisions...

14:58.506 --> 14:59.637
...but it's just something
I have to do.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.729
I will always love you.

So, I guess that's it.

on the next episode!

15:16.002 --> 15:18.221
I tried to tell her I was
the wrong guy for the project!

15:18.308 --> 15:20.267
How could she leave?
What about our band?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.269
What about
my future daughter

15:22.356 --> 15:23.661
What about
my current daughter?

15:23.748 --> 15:25.968
What about all
my non

some sense into that girl.

Where is she?
Heading to the airport.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.017
That's where
the planes take off!

15:31.104 --> 15:32.322
We got to get
over there!

15:32.409 --> 15:34.716
Or maybe
we respect Lainey's wishes

15:34.803 --> 15:36.761
and finally let her
spread her wings on her own.

to the airport.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.593
I'm coming for ya,
French fry!

15:42.680 --> 15:44.247
Okay, everyone stop!

15:44.334 --> 15:46.380
We all know
who needs to do this.

15:46.467 --> 15:47.555
Go.

15:47.642 --> 15:48.991
BILL: Damn it, she's right.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.558
Go bring her back
to us, kid.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.696
Sorry. I couldn't take it
anymore.

15:58.783 --> 15:59.523
You got a problem.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.872
I really do.

16:02.831 --> 16:03.919
ADULT ADAM: Even though
Lainey made the easy choice

16:04.006 --> 16:06.226
to just cut and run,

16:06.313 --> 16:09.055
Barry would never let
the love of his life
fly away without a fight.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.753
Would you like the peanuts
or the pretzels?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.059
She'll have the me.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.321
Barry,
what are you doing here?

16:14.408 --> 16:15.713
Bro,
switch seats with me.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.888
I'm in first class.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.151
Billy Idol's up there.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.804
Sweet!

16:19.891 --> 16:21.284
You're here?
Seriously?

16:21.371 --> 16:23.460
Look, I'm sorry
I followed you.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.593
Don't be.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.377
I didn't say goodbye 'cause
I thought it would be easier,

16:27.464 --> 16:28.509
but it just made me
feel worse.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.641
Well, the good news is,
you don't have to say it,

16:30.728 --> 16:31.773
'cause I'm coming
with you.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.296
Barry...
I mean it.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.124
Wherever you are,
that's where I'll be.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.257
Honestly, I wish
it was that simple.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.085
We both know you can't
just pick up and leave.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.217
And we both know
when it comes to you,

16:41.304 --> 16:43.741
I'd do anything.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.353
BILLY IDOL: Right now, we're bringing you some in-flight entertainment.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.181
One of our first-class
passengers

16:48.268 --> 16:49.834
would like
to sing you a song

16:49.921 --> 16:51.836
inspired by one
of our coach passengers.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.403
Wait, what's Billy Idol
talking about?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.492
There's a whole thing
going on up there.

16:55.579 --> 17:01.281

It is us.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.186
No, these two are just...
so ready to be together,

17:37.273 --> 17:38.535
to grow old together.

17:38.622 --> 17:39.841
So are we.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.712
Bar,
we love each other,

17:41.799 --> 17:43.671
but we're just
two impulsive kids.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.151
We have our whole lives
ahead of us.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.589
As much as I hoped
this flight would be

17:48.676 --> 17:49.459
the start
of something huge for us,

17:49.546 --> 17:51.853
I...

17:51.940 --> 17:53.507
Guess it really means
goodbye.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.248
For now.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.511
Just promise me

17:57.598 --> 17:59.904

17:59.991 --> 18:01.123

ADULT ADAM:
In the end, it took
two strangers madly in love

18:20.969 --> 18:22.405
to show Barry and Lainey

18:22.492 --> 18:24.277
that instead of trying
to grow old together,

18:24.364 --> 18:25.713
they had to grow up first.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.410
Any luck, son?

18:27.497 --> 18:28.629
No.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.065
Aw, schmoopie.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.243
That's okay,
buddy.

18:41.032 --> 18:42.947
Hey. Let's talk.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.558
I know. I'm a moron.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.516
I made you
blow a ton of money on me.

18:46.603 --> 18:47.865
I'll pay you back
somehow, okay?

18:51.304 --> 18:52.566
I don't care
about the money.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.220
I just care about you.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.744
Truth is...

18:56.831 --> 18:58.311
I know how hard
this is for you.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.443
You really don't.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.316
You forget
that I was engaged
to another woman

19:03.403 --> 19:05.535
before your mother.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.538
And like you,
I was young, stubborn,
and stupid.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.019
And what happened?
Lucky for me,

19:11.106 --> 19:12.934
she knew in her heart
that we weren't ready,

19:13.021 --> 19:14.805
and I took it hard.

19:14.892 --> 19:15.850
I thought
my life was over.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.286
I get it.

19:17.373 --> 19:20.550
But then
I met your mom,

19:20.637 --> 19:24.772
and I found out
my life was just beginning,

19:24.859 --> 19:25.990
just like yours is.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.254
ADAM: Hey.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.734
I, uh...
I made you something.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.345
I... I thought
it might cheer you up.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.869
Hey, don't come in here with
another dumbass comedy video.

19:34.956 --> 19:36.697
Actually,

19:36.784 --> 19:38.916
this time,
I kept it real.

19:39.003 --> 19:41.310
I... I think this
is the goodbye
that Lainey wanted.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.225
ADULT ADAM:
Barry and Lainey had
always been the one couple

19:43.312 --> 19:44.400
everyone was rooting for.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.707
Sure, they were mismatched,

19:46.794 --> 19:49.492
but together,
their love just made sense.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.972
That's why it was
so heartbreaking

19:51.059 --> 19:52.800
they never got
their happy ending.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.063
At least, not in this decade.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.283
Lainey's life
took some crazy turns,

19:57.370 --> 20:00.416
but eventually, their paths would cross again.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.549
As for me, I had been
hiding behind jokes

20:02.636 --> 20:04.377
and making silly movies,

20:04.464 --> 20:06.857
but this very moment
changed it all.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.686
I learned that every story
needs a little heart.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.775
And in my family,
we had a lot of it.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.346
ADAM:
Dunn-a dunna dun-a!

20:17.433 --> 20:19.653
Da party! Party!

20:19.740 --> 20:23.091
Starring Adam Goldberg
as the cameraman.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.398
We also have...Susan.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.313
Also Beverly.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.317
Oh, that's so good.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.667
BOTH: I had brothers
who said,

20:33.754 --> 20:36.409
"If you get married,
we won't help you."

20:36.496 --> 20:38.802
I had a rare condition.

20:38.889 --> 20:42.806
My appendix burst inside
without causing me any pain.

20:42.893 --> 20:46.332
I have one large scar
across my abdomen

20:46.419 --> 20:49.857
and one scar
all the way down
my right side.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.642
And I had my kidney...
One of my kidneys removed.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.688
I only have
one kidney now.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.472
Maybe I shouldn't
have said it.
Can I erase that...

20:56.559 --> 20:57.908
Can I erase that...

20:57.995 --> 20:59.867
Erase about the kidney?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.869
Can I erase that?
Erase about the kidney?

21:01.956 --> 21:04.001
I can't believe Pops actually
said all this on camera.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.481
Yeah, this one's a keeper,
all right.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.527
Keeper?
No, you got to erase that.

21:07.614 --> 21:08.963
Come on.
No one besides our family's

21:09.050 --> 21:10.660
ever gonna
see this crazy video.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.706
If I were you,
I'd just tuck it away

21:12.793 --> 21:14.534
and then use it at
my actual wedding to Lainey.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.926
Oh, God.
Please don't go there.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.233
I mean it.
We will end up together.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.279
Maybe not now, but...

21:20.366 --> 21:22.150
Who knows where we'll be
10 years from now?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.935
ADULT ADAM: As off-base
as my brother usually was,

21:25.022 --> 21:26.546
this time, he might've
been onto something.
