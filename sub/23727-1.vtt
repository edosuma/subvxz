03:04.523 --> 03:07.525
Stay as close as you can,
please.

03:21.538 --> 03:24.039
In the reign
of Henry VIII...

03:24.040 --> 03:26.541
When the monasteries
in England were dissolved...

03:26.542 --> 03:28.544
And the occupants tortured,

03:29.044 --> 03:32.046
beheaded in public
or murdered secretly,

03:32.465 --> 03:36.966
some went into hiding to
worship as they pleased.

03:36.967 --> 03:41.971
It is the decaying bodies and skeletons
of these religious martyrs...

03:41.972 --> 03:44.974
That you will see
on your tour.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.477
These catacombs are dangerous.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.979
And I must warn you
to stay with me...

03:50.480 --> 03:52.981
And not lose your way.

04:06.159 --> 04:08.162
Please keep close together.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.803
- My brooch!
- Hmm?

04:38.804 --> 04:41.307
I must have dropped it somewhere.

04:43.808 --> 04:45.811
Thank you.

05:14.419 --> 05:16.419
Well, which way shall we go?

05:16.420 --> 05:19.423
Well, it's a toss-up. Let's try this way.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.833
- Dead end.
- Sorry. Wrong guess.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.710
Well, there's no way out of here.
Let's go back.

06:44.212 --> 06:47.216
There's no way out there.

06:49.134 --> 06:51.636
- Who are you?
- Where did you come from?

06:53.088 --> 06:54.587
All in good time.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.589
Look, how do we
get out of here?

06:56.590 --> 07:00.142
- All in good time.
- I'm in a hurry!

07:00.143 --> 07:02.312
It can wait.

07:02.313 --> 07:05.482
- It really can't wait. I have an appointment.
- Sit.

07:07.484 --> 07:09.485
All of you.

07:11.487 --> 07:13.488
Please sit down.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.492
Sit down.

07:17.493 --> 07:19.993
I assure you,
I have a purpose.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.828
What purpose?

07:25.782 --> 07:28.000
Why did you come in here?

07:28.001 --> 07:31.837
I don't know.
I was just driving by and...

07:33.839 --> 07:35.674
Something made me.

07:35.675 --> 07:39.510
And what are your plans
when you leave here?

07:39.511 --> 07:42.180
Plans?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.300
Plans.

08:50.156 --> 08:53.157
"To Joanne.
The best wife in the World.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.410
Love from Richard."
And a big kiss.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.969
Merry Christmas.

10:44.705 --> 10:46.706
Mummy! Mummy!

10:49.209 --> 10:51.008
Just a minute, darling.

10:51.009 --> 10:53.296
Mummy will be right up.

11:19.151 --> 11:21.953
- Mummy!
- I'm coming, Carol!

11:34.715 --> 11:37.716
- Carol, darling, what's the matter?
- Did Santa come yet?

11:37.717 --> 11:39.718
No, darling, not yet. You be a
good girl and go on to sleep.

11:39.719 --> 11:42.220
- Can I see him when he comes?
- We'll see.

11:42.221 --> 11:44.527
Now you be a good girl and go to sleep.
Otherwise, Santa won't come.

11:44.582 --> 11:48.726
- What's this?
- Nothing. Just a Christmas card from daddy.

11:48.727 --> 11:51.729
- All right? Good night.
- Good night, mummy.

11:51.730 --> 11:54.648
Night, daddy!

13:04.993 --> 13:09.329
We interrupt this
program for a special announcement.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.832
A man described
as a homicidal maniac...

13:12.333 --> 13:15.834
Has escaped from the hospital
for the criminally insane.

13:15.835 --> 13:18.337
He is 6 foot 3 inches tall,

13:18.338 --> 13:22.341
210 pounds,
dark eyes, bald,

13:22.842 --> 13:25.343
and may be wearing
a Santa claus costume...

13:25.344 --> 13:28.346
Taken from a shop in Burley.

13:28.347 --> 13:32.149
All residents of the county are warned
to be on the lookout for this man...

13:32.150 --> 13:36.019
And to phone the police
if they see him.

13:36.020 --> 13:39.990
We now continue our program
of Carols for Christmas Eve.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.691
Blood.

19:02.135 --> 19:04.103
Carol.

19:04.104 --> 19:06.605
Carol!

19:06.606 --> 19:08.857
Carol! Carol.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.860
Carol, where are you?

19:13.362 --> 19:15.363
Carol? Carol!

19:18.866 --> 19:21.652
Oh, no.

19:29.993 --> 19:34.379
He's here, mummy!
I let him in. It's Santa!

20:01.436 --> 20:03.771
Nonsense.
I have no inten...

20:03.772 --> 20:06.907
hadn't you?

20:06.908 --> 20:09.159
And you?

20:09.160 --> 20:11.829
I'm on my way home
to see my wife and children.

20:13.113 --> 20:16.583
- And then?
- Hmm?

20:18.034 --> 20:19.786
And then?

20:23.288 --> 20:25.007
And then?

20:54.783 --> 20:58.284
- Well, I'm all set.
- Must you go tonight, Carl?

20:58.285 --> 21:00.621
Can't you leave it
till the morning?

21:01.038 --> 21:03.039
No, I'm afraid
I can't.

21:03.040 --> 21:06.708
My appointment's in the morning.
I'll have to drive all night to make it.

21:06.709 --> 21:09.494
When will you be back?

21:09.495 --> 21:13.498
I, uh... I don't know.
We'll have to see how it works out.

21:13.499 --> 21:15.333
I'll, um...
I'll phone you.

21:15.334 --> 21:18.169
Did you say good night to the kids?

21:18.170 --> 21:20.422
No. I was just going to.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.089
Good night, daddy.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.960
Good-bye, darling.

22:18.722 --> 22:21.223
Don't forget to ring me
when you get there.

22:21.224 --> 22:23.725
I will. Good-bye, darling.

22:23.726 --> 22:26.979
- Bye. Drive carefully.
- Yes, right.

23:44.846 --> 23:46.847
The removal men came this morning.

23:46.848 --> 23:49.350
Yeah, well, so I see.

23:49.351 --> 23:53.853
- It should all be there by the time we get there.
- Yeah.

23:53.854 --> 23:58.858
- A shame to give up a nice flat like this.
- Yes, I know that, darling.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.228
But we've both had to give up
quite a bit, haven't we?

24:10.485 --> 24:13.487
I love you, Susan.
You know that, don't you?

24:13.488 --> 24:16.490
Yes, of course I do.

24:17.491 --> 24:20.494
You meet someone,
and suddenly that's it.

24:21.996 --> 24:26.800
I kissed my kids tonight
and... and...

24:31.254 --> 24:35.256
Oh, for hell's sake! I mean, it will
be worth it, won't it, for both of us?

24:35.257 --> 24:37.760
Of course it will.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.762
You are tired.
Let me drive.

24:41.262 --> 24:42.764
Yeah, okay.

25:04.666 --> 25:08.419
No. No.

25:09.503 --> 25:11.871
No. No!

25:11.872 --> 25:14.592
No.

25:21.464 --> 25:24.182
No. No!

25:33.307 --> 25:35.309
I'm sorry. Bad dream.

25:39.279 --> 25:42.615
Look out!

26:27.321 --> 26:29.322
Susan.

26:51.341 --> 26:53.843
Susan, where are you?

27:49.258 --> 27:53.261
You crazy fool! Do you want
to get yourself kill...

28:32.095 --> 28:35.297
Darling.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.395
What's the matter then?
Look.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.397
Well, pull yourself together. What's the matter?

28:54.398 --> 28:56.649
Come on now.

29:29.595 --> 29:33.097
- Yes?
- Susan!

29:33.098 --> 29:36.601
- Who is it?
- It's me, Carl.

29:36.602 --> 29:38.603
Carl?

29:39.604 --> 29:42.605
Carl... it can't be.

29:42.606 --> 29:45.107
"Can't be"?
What do you mean?

29:45.108 --> 29:47.610
Carl was...

29:47.611 --> 29:49.612
where have you been?

29:49.613 --> 29:51.614
Please go away.

29:51.615 --> 29:54.083
Look, I've been worried
out of my mind.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.585
What's happened?

29:58.586 --> 30:00.588
The furniture.

30:02.090 --> 30:03.591
I don't understand.
How'd it...

30:04.092 --> 30:07.594
I brought it back
after the crash.

30:07.595 --> 30:10.096
- Huh?
- And I was blinded.

30:10.097 --> 30:12.098
Blinded?

30:12.099 --> 30:14.100
And Carl was killed.

30:14.101 --> 30:16.102
Killed?

30:17.103 --> 30:19.688
Two years ago.

30:29.730 --> 30:32.732
I'm sorry. Bad dream.

30:34.869 --> 30:38.872
Look out!

31:01.976 --> 31:04.560
So that is why you were in a hurry?

31:11.567 --> 31:15.321
- To leave your wife and children?
- What do you mean?

31:17.939 --> 31:21.241
How do you...
who are you?

31:25.112 --> 31:26.863
I assure you,
I have a purpose.

31:29.165 --> 31:32.167
- What sort of game are you playing?
- Game?

31:32.168 --> 31:34.453
You're trying to
frighten us in some way.

31:35.754 --> 31:37.539
What do you want?

31:39.958 --> 31:41.959
To show you something.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.794
Something in your own mind.

31:44.795 --> 31:47.680
Something you are capable
of doing.

31:47.681 --> 31:49.881
I don't wanna know.

31:49.882 --> 31:52.185
Oh, but you must know.

31:54.187 --> 31:56.189
You must.

32:34.806 --> 32:36.673
Thank you.

32:37.175 --> 32:39.675
- We knew it was you.
- You knew it was me?

32:39.676 --> 32:42.178
Dear old punch though,
he's very nice, isn't he?

32:42.179 --> 32:45.180
Ah, I know some of you
have to get home rather soon.

32:45.181 --> 32:48.183
So there's your little
present, my dear. There.

32:48.184 --> 32:51.186
- Thank you, Mr. Grimsdyke.
- That's all right.

32:51.187 --> 32:55.689
Now shall I tell you something? My wife's
name was Helen. Mary Helen Grimsdyke.

32:55.690 --> 32:59.192
I always called her Helen. It's
a nice name, isn't it? Yeah.

32:59.193 --> 33:01.195
- Bye-bye then.
- Come on, Mark. Come on, Julie.

33:01.695 --> 33:03.997
Come and sit here. Bye-bye, Mark.
Bye-bye, Julie.

33:03.998 --> 33:07.834
Bye.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.669
Bye.

33:10.670 --> 33:13.537
Two little dickey birds
sitting on a wall.

33:13.538 --> 33:15.540
One named Peter.
One named Paul.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.042
Fly away, Peter.
Fly away, Paul.

33:18.043 --> 33:20.043
Come back, Peter.
Come back, Paul.

33:20.044 --> 33:22.346
That's it.
You think you could do that?

33:31.304 --> 33:33.305
What are you looking at?

33:33.306 --> 33:35.307
Grimsdyke, of course.

33:35.809 --> 33:37.809
His usual shell out to the kids.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.311
He does it every year
on his birthday.

33:40.312 --> 33:42.813
- I don't know how you stand it.
- Stand what?

33:42.814 --> 33:45.315
Living across the road
from that man.

33:45.316 --> 33:48.318
He's a rubbish collector.
A dustman.

33:48.319 --> 33:50.821
His place is an eyesore.

33:50.822 --> 33:56.325
The toys he give those kids he finds
in the rubbish heap and repairs.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.827
- Why doesn't he sell out?
- I've made him offers.

33:58.828 --> 34:02.331
He's... he's sentimental
about that old dump.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.834
Says he and his wife lived there
for their whole married life.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.335
And now he wants to die
there, just as she did.

34:08.837 --> 34:11.840
Well, it ruins the neighbourhood and
depreciates the value of our property.

34:12.340 --> 34:14.342
The inside must be
like a pigsty.

34:14.842 --> 34:16.342
He owns the place
free and clear.

34:17.844 --> 34:19.679
Nothing we can do about it.

34:19.679 --> 34:23.598
Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.
Shut the gate.

34:23.599 --> 34:25.601
Bye-bye.

34:40.447 --> 34:42.449
Isn't there?

35:27.622 --> 35:29.373
What on earth
have you been doing?

35:29.374 --> 35:33.293
Somebody's just made an awful
mess of Mr. Baker's garden.

35:33.794 --> 35:39.080
Poor Grimsdyke's neighbour.
He was so proud of his prize roses.

35:39.081 --> 35:41.583
My prize roses.

35:41.584 --> 35:44.084
Years of hard work.

35:44.085 --> 35:46.971
It's Grimsdyke's dogs for sure.

35:46.972 --> 35:50.307
This is too much. I'd like to
make an official complaint.

35:50.308 --> 35:52.643
But you mustn't take them away.

35:53.144 --> 35:57.147
They're my friends.
Sergeant, please.

35:57.148 --> 35:59.649
It's a court order,
and they don't have licenses.

35:59.650 --> 36:02.151
- I couldn't afford licenses.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Grimsdyke.

36:02.152 --> 36:04.653
Sergeant, please.

36:15.696 --> 36:19.699
Darling. Darling?

36:19.700 --> 36:21.701
Are you there, darling?

36:23.703 --> 36:25.704
Are you there, darling?

36:28.207 --> 36:30.209
Can you hear me?

36:31.093 --> 36:34.045
Can you hear me?

36:35.046 --> 36:38.550
Is there any... anything
you wish to tell me?

36:48.192 --> 36:51.026
Ah!

36:51.027 --> 36:52.862
Give me the message.

37:17.917 --> 37:20.802
D... d...

37:20.803 --> 37:22.588
wait.

37:32.646 --> 37:35.148
Danger. Danger?

37:37.518 --> 37:40.569
Who to? Who to?

37:40.570 --> 37:43.488
Is it one of the children?

37:43.489 --> 37:46.324
Who to?

37:46.325 --> 37:49.778
Just think it over,
councillor Ramsey.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.282
Grimsdyke's due
to retire in two years.

37:55.283 --> 37:58.286
He's done his job well. There's
no reason why the town council...

37:58.785 --> 38:01.787
he's too old. Don't you
think a younger man...

38:01.788 --> 38:03.789
he'd lose
his retirement pay.

38:03.790 --> 38:06.292
And save the town
some money.

38:31.314 --> 38:33.814
Poor old Grimsdyke.

38:33.815 --> 38:35.651
I do believe
he's out of a job.

38:52.415 --> 38:54.417
Hmm.

38:58.921 --> 39:01.923
Flowers are a little wilted,
aren't they, my dear?

39:01.924 --> 39:03.924
God bless you.

39:03.925 --> 39:07.428
Plenty more in the garden.
I'll get you some tomorrow.

39:19.439 --> 39:21.440
Oh!

39:26.946 --> 39:29.863
Jamie! Jamie!
My little Jamie.

39:29.864 --> 39:32.367
Oh, I wondered
where you were.

39:32.867 --> 39:35.868
Oh, I'm so glad
they didn't get you.

39:35.869 --> 39:39.872
Welcome home. Oh. Better
save money now, hadn't we?

39:39.873 --> 39:43.544
Hey, look. Helen, look who's come back.
Our little Jamie.

39:44.043 --> 39:48.547
Ah, that's wonderful. You're our only friend now.
You and the children.

39:48.548 --> 39:52.017
We thought it might be neighbourly
to let you know what was going on.

39:52.018 --> 39:55.019
It's very kind of you to draw our
attention to this, Mr. Elliot.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.522
It's so difficult to know what one's children
get up to when they're out of one's sight.

39:59.023 --> 40:00.525
After all, last year
I remember...

40:01.025 --> 40:04.527
you can tell from looking at his house
what a filthy old man he is.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.029
Constantly filling it
with children.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.532
Heaven knows what
his motivations are.

40:11.484 --> 40:14.485
Now don't forget what I said.
Just stay away from him.

40:14.486 --> 40:16.488
But, mummy, he's such
a nice old man.

40:16.489 --> 40:19.791
Don't argue with me.
You're not to see him again ever.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.210
Why don't you go and play
in our garden?

40:22.211 --> 40:24.711
And don't take
any more sweets from him.

40:24.712 --> 40:28.497
Carrying rubbish all day.
His house must be filthy.

40:28.498 --> 40:32.251
You and your Mr. Grimsdyke. Now, remember,
I don't want you to go anywhere near him.

40:32.252 --> 40:33.970
Oh, mum...
and that's final.

40:38.891 --> 40:41.393
I don't understand it.

40:41.394 --> 40:44.395
Everyone was so kind.

40:44.396 --> 40:47.898
Now this. No work.

40:47.899 --> 40:50.401
No children.

40:50.402 --> 40:52.404
No one to make toys for.

40:55.406 --> 40:56.906
Well, never mind.

40:58.408 --> 41:01.910
We've always got each other,
haven't we, my dear?

41:01.911 --> 41:04.413
Mmm. That's all that matters.

41:06.416 --> 41:09.917
Just one more turn
of the screw...

41:09.918 --> 41:12.669
And he'll sell his property
for next to nothing.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.839
What's on your mind?

41:17.341 --> 41:19.175
Valentine's day.

41:19.176 --> 41:22.596
It's just two weeks away.
So?

41:24.597 --> 41:28.100
We'll send him valentines...

41:28.101 --> 41:30.853
From everyone in town.

41:32.137 --> 41:34.138
Oh. Lots of mail for you today,
Mr. Grimsdyke.

41:34.139 --> 41:37.140
Good morning.
Thank you very much.

41:37.141 --> 41:40.361
Well, how very kind.

41:41.646 --> 41:43.646
My dear, look.

41:43.647 --> 41:46.148
It's not even Christmas,
is it?

41:46.149 --> 41:49.151
Not that it makes any difference
if it is or not.

41:49.152 --> 41:51.954
Who could be writing to us?
Let's see here.

41:53.405 --> 41:56.574
Oh! It's a Valentine card.

41:56.575 --> 42:00.577
But you're my only sweetheart.
Who can this be?

42:00.578 --> 42:03.080
"Noisy are children,
loud is a bell,

42:03.081 --> 42:06.583
pungent is perfume,
but you only smell."

42:07.084 --> 42:10.086
Hmm? "Noisy are children,
loud is a bell,

42:10.087 --> 42:13.088
pungent is perfume,
but you only smell."

42:13.089 --> 42:15.891
Why, I don't think
I like that.

42:15.892 --> 42:18.261
Let's see what
we have here.

42:23.265 --> 42:26.901
"A tree is beautiful
if its owner prunes it,

42:26.902 --> 42:28.902
"but our town isn't...

42:28.903 --> 42:32.406
'Cause your presence
ruins it."

42:34.408 --> 42:36.409
Oh.

42:45.918 --> 42:47.919
"Some people live
in the country.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.421
"Some people live
in the town.

42:51.422 --> 42:54.425
"Why don't you do
us a service?

42:55.927 --> 42:59.179
Jump in the river and..."

43:24.868 --> 43:28.037
What's Grimsdyke been
doing to that mongrel?

43:28.038 --> 43:31.408
He hasn't stopped
whining for a week.

43:33.910 --> 43:35.910
You know,
come to think of it,

43:35.911 --> 43:38.413
I haven't seen Grimsdyke
for days.

43:40.916 --> 43:43.250
Not since Valentine's day.

43:49.172 --> 43:51.674
He can't be far away
if the door's open.

43:53.676 --> 43:55.677
This place is spotless.

43:55.678 --> 43:57.679
I thought it'd be filthy.

44:35.128 --> 44:38.265
"But the merciful goodness of
the Lord endureth forever and ever...

44:38.266 --> 44:40.266
"Upon them that fear him,

44:40.267 --> 44:42.767
"and his righteousness
upon his children's children.

44:42.768 --> 44:46.771
"For as much as it hath pleased
almighty God of his great mercy...

44:46.772 --> 44:49.224
To take unto himself
the soul of our dear brother"...

44:49.725 --> 44:54.361
Arthur Edward Grimsdyke.
"Here departed.

44:54.362 --> 44:57.364
"We therefore commit
his body to the ground.

44:57.365 --> 45:00.868
"Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

45:00.869 --> 45:02.869
"Dust to dust.

45:02.870 --> 45:05.872
"In sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life,

45:05.873 --> 45:08.874
through our Lord
Jesus Christ"...

45:08.875 --> 45:11.376
it was kind of you
to pay for the burial.

45:11.377 --> 45:13.879
It was the least I could do.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.883
He was a neighbour.

45:58.723 --> 46:01.225
What's that?

46:01.226 --> 46:03.227
Valentine's cards.

46:03.228 --> 46:07.735
The ones left over
from last year when...

46:08.235 --> 46:11.740
- must be a year ago.
- Today.

46:12.240 --> 46:16.245
It's Valentine's day.
February the 14th.

46:16.246 --> 46:18.749
A year ago exactly.

47:40.990 --> 47:42.993
I'm going to bed.
See you in the morning.

47:46.781 --> 47:48.533
Night.

47:48.534 --> 47:50.870
Night.

49:21.740 --> 49:23.743
"You were mean...

49:24.242 --> 49:26.545
"And cruel...

49:26.546 --> 49:30.334
"Right from the start.

49:30.335 --> 49:34.339
"Now you really have...

49:34.340 --> 49:36.342
No"...

49:55.668 --> 49:57.919
It's true.

49:57.920 --> 50:00.923
It's true.

50:00.924 --> 50:03.294
I didn't...

50:05.264 --> 50:08.018
don't like Grimsdyke.

50:18.398 --> 50:20.867
What am I doing here?

50:23.570 --> 50:26.408
You'll see.

50:42.345 --> 50:44.848
Well, that's it,
Ralph, I'm afraid.

50:44.849 --> 50:46.734
It's all gone.

50:46.735 --> 50:51.690
- Everything?
- More than everything. You have debts.

50:51.691 --> 50:56.196
I did warn you, didn't I, not to use the
money that had been entrusted to you?

50:56.197 --> 50:59.116
- The risks were far too great.
- The risks?

50:59.117 --> 51:01.621
The gains could've
been enormous.

51:05.125 --> 51:07.261
What do I do now?

51:08.263 --> 51:11.265
Well, you have two choices.

51:11.266 --> 51:13.135
First, bankruptcy.

51:13.136 --> 51:15.972
And according to you, that would
be dishonourable, wouldn't it?

51:15.973 --> 51:18.442
Oh, come on.
Let's face it.

51:18.443 --> 51:21.780
You've done dishonourable things in your
life before, in your business life.

51:21.781 --> 51:25.735
Hard, ruthless...
oh, perhaps even cruel.

51:25.736 --> 51:28.956
Yes, to build up the Jason empire,
sometimes I had to be.

51:28.957 --> 51:31.993
- No one has to be.
- I did.

51:31.994 --> 51:36.500
Oh, it's easy to talk, but I had
to fight my way up the hard way.

51:36.501 --> 51:38.752
If people got hurt,
they got hurt.

51:38.753 --> 51:42.173
But I always paid my debts.

51:42.174 --> 51:44.176
No, I'm not going
into bankruptcy.

51:44.177 --> 51:47.263
Well, if you intend to try
and pay off your debts,

51:47.264 --> 51:50.651
you'll have to start selling things,
things of value...

51:50.652 --> 51:53.822
properties, your paintings...
everything.

51:53.823 --> 51:58.528
My house? All the beautiful things
I've acquired during the years?

51:58.529 --> 52:00.914
It's the only way.

52:00.915 --> 52:03.419
I won't do it.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.423
I'm afraid you'll have to.

52:09.176 --> 52:11.212
So, there's
nothing else for it.

52:11.213 --> 52:13.215
We have to sell.

52:13.715 --> 52:16.218
Oh, I know it's a blow.

52:16.219 --> 52:20.725
Our whole life's in them.
Everything we've collected all over the world.

52:23.311 --> 52:25.614
I remember that one.

52:25.615 --> 52:28.618
We got it in that strange
shop in Hong Kong...

52:28.619 --> 52:32.123
When you were
selling guns to...

52:32.624 --> 52:36.629
do you remember what the little man in the
shop said to us when he sold it to us?

52:36.630 --> 52:40.634
Yes. "Use it"...
"use it wisely."

52:40.635 --> 52:44.138
Hmm! I wonder what
he meant by that.

52:44.139 --> 52:47.142
Ralph, have you...

52:47.143 --> 52:51.147
have you ever seen this writing that's
inscribed on the bottom of this statuette?

52:51.148 --> 52:54.653
- Writing?
- Hmm, yes, here at the base.

52:57.023 --> 53:02.279
"Three wishes I give
and no more...

53:02.280 --> 53:07.118
"To each owner of me...

53:07.119 --> 53:09.121
"So keep score.

53:10.123 --> 53:14.127
"Each wish will come true...

53:14.128 --> 53:18.268
So take care what you do."

53:19.602 --> 53:22.355
I can't read the rest,
but the last word is...

53:22.356 --> 53:25.643
- "Deplore."
- What does it all mean?

53:25.644 --> 53:27.647
"Use it wisely."

53:29.148 --> 53:31.651
If only it could give us
three wishes.

53:31.652 --> 53:33.653
That's storybook nonsense.

53:33.654 --> 53:37.574
- But it reminds me of a tale I once read. What was it?
- We could pay all our debts.

53:37.575 --> 53:40.378
- "The monkey's paw." That's what it was.
- I wish...

53:40.379 --> 53:42.381
I read it when
I was at school.

53:42.382 --> 53:44.884
I wish for lots
and lots of money.

53:44.885 --> 53:48.889
- Oh, no, no!
- Too late. I already have.

53:48.890 --> 53:51.393
And I've just remembered what
happened at the end of the story.

53:51.394 --> 53:54.897
Why, you said yourself,
it was just a story...

53:54.898 --> 53:58.903
like our three wishes.

54:03.025 --> 54:05.329
Hello? Oh, hello, Charles.

54:05.330 --> 54:08.198
- I'd like you to come down to my office.
- What, right now?

54:08.199 --> 54:10.201
- Yes, straight away.
- What's it all about?

54:10.202 --> 54:12.871
It's very important.
It's about money.

54:12.872 --> 54:15.374
I'd like you
to come straight away.

54:15.375 --> 54:17.545
I'll be right there.

54:21.049 --> 54:24.053
That's Charles.
He wants me to go and see him right away.

54:24.054 --> 54:27.057
- He said something about money.
- Money?

54:42.211 --> 54:45.549
Maybe our wish will come true after all.

56:27.599 --> 56:29.537
- Hello?
- Is that Mr. Gregory?

56:29.598 --> 56:30.246
Yes, yes, speaking.

56:30.247 --> 56:32.605
I'm sorry to tell you, sir,
but your client, Ralph Jason,

56:32.606 --> 56:34.607
has been killed in a car crash.

56:34.608 --> 56:39.113
- In his car?
- Yes, on the road about 10 Miles from his home.

56:39.114 --> 56:41.984
Well, uh, have you told Enid...
Mrs. Jason yet?

56:41.985 --> 56:44.454
No, not yet.

56:44.455 --> 56:46.957
We found some letters
from you in his pocket.

56:46.958 --> 56:50.461
They indicate that you're not only his
solicitor but a close friend of the family.

56:50.462 --> 56:52.881
We thought it better
that you break the news.

56:52.882 --> 56:56.386
Yes, yes.
Yes, of course.

56:56.387 --> 56:58.389
Leave it to me.

56:58.390 --> 57:00.893
- I'll tell her.
- Thank you, sir.

57:08.102 --> 57:11.106
Ralph? Dead?

57:15.613 --> 57:18.115
They found him in
the wreckage of his car.

57:18.116 --> 57:20.618
He'd obviously lost control,
skidded.

57:23.122 --> 57:27.126
Enid, this may not be the best
moment to talk about this, but, uh,

57:27.127 --> 57:30.130
it may alleviate
some of your other worries.

57:30.131 --> 57:33.134
You realize this accident
makes you a rich woman.

57:35.639 --> 57:38.141
Rich?

57:38.142 --> 57:41.144
Ralph's insurance.
He always carried a large policy,

57:41.145 --> 57:44.650
with a double indemnity
against accident.

57:44.651 --> 57:50.157
Oh, Charles, I wished for lots and lots of money.
Ralph warned me not to.

57:50.158 --> 57:53.162
- No, that's a coincidence, surely.
- No, it's no coincidence.

57:53.662 --> 57:55.665
That statuette...

57:56.666 --> 57:59.169
it gave us three wishes.

57:59.671 --> 58:03.174
I used one of them to wish
for lots and lots of money.

58:04.175 --> 58:06.480
Now I'm going to wish for Ralph back.

58:10.767 --> 58:12.770
Charles.

58:12.771 --> 58:15.741
Do you know the story
of "the monkey's paw"?

58:15.742 --> 58:19.244
That's the story of the old couple
who are given a monkey's paw...

58:19.245 --> 58:21.748
Which entitles them
to three wishes.

58:21.749 --> 58:25.703
They wish for money,
and they get the money...

58:25.704 --> 58:28.590
Because their son is killed...

58:28.591 --> 58:30.594
In a machine in his factory,
crushed.

58:30.595 --> 58:35.350
Enid. You mustn't wish Ralph back.
Why not?

58:35.351 --> 58:39.138
Well, in the story, this mother wishes
her son back, and he does come back,

58:39.139 --> 58:43.443
but in the condition in which he died...
mutilated, mangled, torn.

58:43.444 --> 58:46.699
I must be careful not
to make the same mistake.

58:46.700 --> 58:52.540
I shall wish that Ralph were back
as he was before the accident.

58:55.544 --> 58:57.545
I wish...

58:57.546 --> 59:00.549
Ralph were back exactly as he was...

59:00.550 --> 59:03.555
Immediately before the accident.

59:42.639 --> 59:45.642
- Open it! Quickly!
- No, no. Don't look.

59:45.643 --> 59:47.645
His body was mangled in the crash.

59:49.148 --> 59:50.899
Mangled?
It wasn't mangled.

59:50.900 --> 59:55.456
Mr. Jason died of a heart attack
at the wheel.

59:59.461 --> 01:00:03.466
I wished to bring him back as he was
immediately before the accident.

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.485
But he was already dead...
dead from a heart attack.

01:00:06.514 --> 01:00:08.498
So the accident didn't kill him.

01:00:16.817 --> 01:00:19.821
- Only one more wish.
- Enid

01:00:19.822 --> 01:00:21.824
- please go away. Leave me alone.
- Please

01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:24.327
I want to be alone
with him, please.

01:00:42.935 --> 01:00:45.855
Only one more wish.

01:00:45.856 --> 01:00:47.857
Only one.

01:00:47.858 --> 01:00:50.862
I mustn't waste it.
I must be careful.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.792
Oh, please, please,

01:01:01.793 --> 01:01:05.297
I wish Ralph
were alive now.

01:01:05.298 --> 01:01:07.799
I don't want him
to die ever.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.305
I want him moving,
breathing, talking, alive...

01:01:11.306 --> 01:01:13.809
now, forever!

01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:17.681
- Ralph!
- Oh, Enid!

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:20.900
Ralph! Charles!

01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:22.852
- Help me!
- What's happened?

01:01:22.853 --> 01:01:24.939
- Oh!
- What have you done?

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.076
I wished alive again... forever!

01:01:28.077 --> 01:01:31.698
Don't you realize he's been embalmed?
His veins are filled with embalming fluid...

01:01:31.699 --> 01:01:33.535
- Burning into him!
- Oh, no!

01:01:36.956 --> 01:01:39.258
Enid! Do something!

01:01:43.932 --> 01:01:47.219
For God's sake, Enid!
Help me!

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:52.642
No, no! Enid, don't!

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.030
Aah! Aah!

01:02:20.981 --> 01:02:23.983
But don't you see?
You wished him alive forever!

01:02:23.984 --> 01:02:27.906
You can't kill him!
Every piece of him is alive still!

01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:32.996
Alive and... and suffering...

01:02:32.997 --> 01:02:35.165
Forever.

01:02:50.135 --> 01:02:52.472
Well, what did you see?

01:02:59.899 --> 01:03:03.402
- What did he see?
- What's more important is what you will see.

01:03:03.403 --> 01:03:05.405
Who are you?
What do you want with us?

01:03:05.906 --> 01:03:08.909
- To warn you of what may happen.
- I don't care about your warnings.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.911
- I want to get out of here.
- Very well.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.916
But you should heed the warning.

01:03:43.622 --> 01:03:45.623
- Mr. Rogers?
- Major Rogers.

01:03:45.624 --> 01:03:49.012
Show me to my quarters and have
somebody get my kit in, will you?

01:03:49.013 --> 01:03:51.465
Shane, here.

01:03:51.466 --> 01:03:53.469
Good boy.

01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:22.506
There were pictures on the wall.
Where have they gone?

01:04:22.507 --> 01:04:24.810
Personal property
of your predecessor, sir.

01:04:26.094 --> 01:04:28.574
Well, we must get some more.

01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:31.602
I'll go down to London,
have a look around the galleries.

01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:35.106
Where are the men...
uh, the patients?

01:04:35.107 --> 01:04:37.827
They've gone to lunch, sir.

01:04:37.828 --> 01:04:40.330
You mean dinner, don't you?

01:04:41.248 --> 01:04:43.751
Bon appeéétit, Mr. Carter.

01:04:44.752 --> 01:04:46.754
Thank you, Harry.

01:05:22.302 --> 01:05:24.639
Good morning.

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.843
My name is Rogers.
Major William Rogers.

01:05:28.844 --> 01:05:32.231
I've been appointed your new superintendent
here, and take up my duties today.

01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:36.487
I've had considerable experience in dealing
with men as an officer in the army.

01:05:36.488 --> 01:05:39.857
I promise you I will do this job
to the best of my ability.

01:05:39.858 --> 01:05:42.360
I hope we'll all
get along well.

01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:44.363
If there are
any complaints,

01:05:44.364 --> 01:05:47.868
I shall be pleased to deal with
them in my office at any time.

01:05:47.869 --> 01:05:50.955
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:05:50.956 --> 01:05:53.042
Morning.

01:05:57.131 --> 01:05:59.268
Shane.

01:06:11.117 --> 01:06:13.119
Well, Shane,

01:06:13.619 --> 01:06:15.621
after I've made
a few changes,

01:06:15.622 --> 01:06:17.625
I think we're gonna
like it here.

01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:51.753
Stone cold.

01:06:51.754 --> 01:06:54.756
It's always like that now.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:59.262
All right, old boy?

01:06:59.263 --> 01:07:01.264
All right.

01:07:01.265 --> 01:07:03.770
I'll get you an extra blanket.

01:07:45.657 --> 01:07:48.160
Yes?

01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:09.020
The men have asked me
to come and talk to you.

01:08:09.021 --> 01:08:10.807
Yes?

01:08:10.808 --> 01:08:13.193
It's about the heating.

01:08:16.448 --> 01:08:20.618
It's been very cold these past few nights.
We wondered if you...

01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:24.242
for reasons of economy, the heating is now
turned off each evening at 2000 hours.

01:08:27.211 --> 01:08:31.048
You should all be in bed by then.
After all, there's no point in staying up.

01:08:31.049 --> 01:08:34.304
- You can't see anything.
- The beds are cold.

01:08:34.305 --> 01:08:36.673
There aren't enough blankets.

01:08:36.674 --> 01:08:39.676
I'm trying to run this place as
efficiently and as economically as I can.

01:08:39.678 --> 01:08:43.482
I'm afraid the current budget does not
include the costs of new blankets.

01:08:43.483 --> 01:08:46.152
Do you know anything
about blind people?

01:08:46.153 --> 01:08:49.524
No, I can't say I do,
until I took over this job.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:53.828
But I was in the army for over 20 years,
and I learned to handle all kinds of men there.

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:58.033
With all due respect, sir,
we are not soldiers.

01:08:58.035 --> 01:09:00.788
And blind people are not
like people with sight.

01:09:02.256 --> 01:09:04.260
We have lost one sense,

01:09:04.261 --> 01:09:08.265
but the loss of that one sense
only tends to sharpen the others.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:11.635
Do you know what that means?

01:09:11.636 --> 01:09:14.439
We feel things more acutely.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.862
If food is bad,
it tastes worse to us.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:22.368
If a room is dirty,
we feel every speck.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:27.706
If an insect scurries
across the floor, we hear it.

01:09:27.707 --> 01:09:31.379
And if it's cold,
we feel the cold more.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:38.136
Why don't you sell that painting
and buy us fuel or extra blankets?

01:09:38.136 --> 01:09:40.640
I was not aware that the administration
of expenditure for this establishment...

01:09:40.642 --> 01:09:42.643
Had been handed over to you,
Mr. Carter.

01:09:42.644 --> 01:09:44.647
Good morning.

01:10:04.757 --> 01:10:07.760
- Dishwater.
- Filthy muck.

01:10:08.261 --> 01:10:10.264
There's no meat in it.

01:10:28.288 --> 01:10:30.789
Sorry, dad,
there ain't no more.

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:32.793
No second helping?

01:10:32.794 --> 01:10:36.297
Well, rations were cut,
you see?

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:40.169
Superintendent says he's doing the
best he can with prices so high.

01:10:56.442 --> 01:10:59.944
It's customary to knock on the
door of a private office.

01:10:59.945 --> 01:11:02.949
What do you want?
Can't you see I'm having my lunch?

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:07.455
What is it? Nice juicy steak,
while we get nothing but slop?

01:11:07.456 --> 01:11:10.959
I do the best I can for you within the
limits of the budget provided for me.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:15.466
- But you eat meat... And drink wine.
- I am the officer in charge.

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:18.471
- This isn't the bloody army!
- Mr. Carter!

01:11:18.971 --> 01:11:21.975
In the kingdom of the blind,
even the one-eyed man is king.

01:11:22.859 --> 01:11:24.696
Shane!

01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:31.738
Shane, stay.

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:41.918
Here.

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.352
Doctor.

01:12:21.353 --> 01:12:23.857
Get a doctor.

01:12:34.203 --> 01:12:37.158
Do you realize it's gone midnight?

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.664
Doctor!
Who wants a doctor?

01:12:43.165 --> 01:12:44.667
It's Greenwood, sir.

01:12:46.169 --> 01:12:48.171
Well, can't it wait till the morning?

01:12:48.172 --> 01:12:51.676
He's ill, sir. Very ill.

01:12:53.179 --> 01:12:55.681
Well, I suppose
I'd better take a look.

01:12:59.987 --> 01:13:02.323
Shane, wait.

01:13:03.442 --> 01:13:06.078
Blanket.

01:13:25.304 --> 01:13:27.306
Well, which one is Greenwood?

01:13:45.831 --> 01:13:47.332
The man is dead.

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.614
Very well.

01:17:54.575 --> 01:17:56.494
Shane?

01:17:58.496 --> 01:18:00.498
Shane?

01:18:00.499 --> 01:18:02.334
Shane?

01:18:02.836 --> 01:18:06.339
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Go back to your rooms, all of you!

01:18:08.342 --> 01:18:11.346
It's our turn to give the orders now,

01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:14.851
Major Rogers, sir.

01:18:15.852 --> 01:18:18.856
Well, what... what is it?
What...

01:18:18.857 --> 01:18:20.859
wh-what do you want?

01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:00.295
Let me out of here!

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.134
Let me out!

01:19:15.063 --> 01:19:17.433
Shane.

01:19:18.901 --> 01:19:20.321
Shane.

01:19:22.941 --> 01:19:25.944
All right, boy.
All right. All right, boy.

01:19:25.945 --> 01:19:28.364
What are you doing
to my dog?

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:36.342
What are you doing
to my dog?

01:21:19.811 --> 01:21:22.313
Let me go!

01:21:22.314 --> 01:21:24.317
Let me go!

01:21:28.605 --> 01:21:30.608
Let me go!

01:21:31.109 --> 01:21:33.112
Let me go!

01:21:36.116 --> 01:21:38.753
Let me go!

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:06.989
Your dog seems to be getting hungry,
Major Rogers.

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:09.208
Feed him, please.
Please, feed him.

01:22:09.209 --> 01:22:11.411
All in good time.

01:22:11.412 --> 01:22:15.717
Yes, but you must feed him. He... he'll be dangerous.
He'll go wild, berserk!

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.224
I know, Major Rogers, sir.

01:23:36.741 --> 01:23:40.529
What are you...
Doing out there?

01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:45.452
You'll see... soon enough.

01:24:09.117 --> 01:24:12.121
Look, give me something to eat,
please. Please!

01:24:12.621 --> 01:24:16.744
I haven't had anything to eat or drink
for over two days. Please, please!

01:24:23.885 --> 01:24:26.638
Well, at least feed my dog,
please!

01:24:26.639 --> 01:24:28.475
He'll be fed, all right,

01:24:31.679 --> 01:24:34.683
Major Rogers, sir.

01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:14.109
Aah!

01:27:39.476 --> 01:27:41.262
Aah!

01:28:00.789 --> 01:28:02.505
You...

01:28:22.283 --> 01:28:26.121
No! Shane!

01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:35.382
What is all this?

01:28:35.383 --> 01:28:38.387
I'm on my way to a new job.

01:28:38.388 --> 01:28:41.891
I don't know...
Why I stopped here.

01:28:41.892 --> 01:28:44.645
I do.

01:28:49.234 --> 01:28:51.104
Now you may go.

01:29:14.352 --> 01:29:17.437
But how can we...
where are we?

01:29:17.438 --> 01:29:23.278
In a place where people go who
have died without repentance.

01:29:23.279 --> 01:29:26.733
You see,
I wasn't warning you,

01:29:26.734 --> 01:29:30.238
but telling you why
you are here...

01:29:30.239 --> 01:29:32.959
For all eternity.

01:30:21.356 --> 01:30:23.809
And now...

01:30:25.812 --> 01:30:27.815
Who's next?

01:30:29.316 --> 01:30:32.319
Perhaps you?
