<i>Previously on "The Bold Type"...</i>

00:01.640 --> 00:03.768
You're in charge of
tomorrow's accessory shoot.

00:03.808 --> 00:06.099
Follow the Look Book,
but don't let me down.

00:06.176 --> 00:07.876
I'm trying to get this
really cool photographer.

00:07.911 --> 00:09.577
<i>- What about Adena?
- We don't even know</i>

00:09.613 --> 00:11.479
<i>if Adena can do this.</i>

00:11.515 --> 00:12.881
I want to hire Adena.
She deserves a shot.

00:12.916 --> 00:14.616
The fact is, we are very different.

00:14.651 --> 00:16.751
<i>But we never let that stop us.</i>

00:16.787 --> 00:19.554
- You care a lot.
- I love doing what I do.

00:19.589 --> 00:20.755
Like you, I'm guessing.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.457
This is where you belong, Jane.

00:22.492 --> 00:23.892
- I know.
- So what are you going to do?

00:23.927 --> 00:26.594
<i>Go see Jacqueline,
and see if I can come back.</i>

00:26.630 --> 00:29.597
I'm not sure that that is
the best thing for you.

00:29.633 --> 00:32.433
<i>You need to live in this failure.</i>

00:33.804 --> 00:38.473
<i>So, if you're a creative director
into craft beer and street art,</i>

00:38.508 --> 00:39.674
that makes you a douchebag, right?

00:39.709 --> 00:41.443
Mm, probably.

00:41.478 --> 00:44.646
Well, let's live a little. Swipe right.

00:44.681 --> 00:46.915
Oh, my god, that's Brooke Langley,
the influencer.

00:46.950 --> 00:49.918
How does she always look like
she just got off a plane from Tulum?

00:49.953 --> 00:52.720
She did, I'm one of her half
million Insta followers.

00:52.756 --> 00:54.489
She's having breakfast with Oliver.

00:54.524 --> 00:55.623
I bet they didn't put
her name in the system.

00:55.659 --> 00:56.925
- I got to go.
- Go.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.761
She's with me, it's okay. Hey.

00:59.796 --> 01:01.496
I'm Sutton Brady, Oliver's assistant.

01:01.531 --> 01:02.764
Nice to meet you, Sutton.

01:02.799 --> 01:04.566
So how long have you worked
at "Scarlet"?

01:04.601 --> 01:06.734
Uh, four years and three months.

01:06.770 --> 01:09.604
Sorry, I don't know why I just said that
like it was a baby's age.

01:09.639 --> 01:10.772
Part of me regrets
that I never got to do

01:10.807 --> 01:12.474
the whole assistant thing, you know?

01:12.509 --> 01:13.708
Meeting up with the other assistants,

01:13.743 --> 01:15.510
gossiping about bosses. Sounds so fun.

01:15.545 --> 01:16.744
Oh, yeah, and the money.

01:18.448 --> 01:19.781
Brooke, meet Kat Edison.

01:19.816 --> 01:21.292
Head of our social media department.

01:21.327 --> 01:22.517
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:22.552 --> 01:24.652
- I'm obsessed with your Insta.
- Thanks.

01:24.688 --> 01:26.588
Go ahead.

01:27.791 --> 01:29.524
So how long have you been at "Scarlet"?

01:29.559 --> 01:31.526
Um, about four years.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.628
And already a department head,
impressive.

01:33.663 --> 01:35.463
Yeah.

01:35.499 --> 01:37.866
Between building out the team
and helping with our website relaunch,

01:37.901 --> 01:39.534
it's been kind of a crazy few months.

01:39.569 --> 01:41.669
- Great.
- Yeah, speaking of,

01:41.705 --> 01:43.438
I have a meeting
with our editor in chief,

01:43.473 --> 01:44.772
- but it was great to meet you.
- You too.

01:44.808 --> 01:46.574
- All right, see you, honey.
- Bye.

01:46.610 --> 01:49.444
Brooke, so sorry
about your security snafu.

01:49.479 --> 01:50.845
I swear, they treat this place
like it's the Pentagon.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.615
It's not a problem.
Isn't this guy adorable?

01:53.650 --> 01:55.884
When he doesn't have
a mild case of the runs, yes.

01:55.919 --> 01:58.653
The vet has been prepped,
and so have you.

_

02:30.654 --> 02:32.453
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:32.489 --> 02:34.622
This place is cute.

02:34.658 --> 02:37.458
I'm sorry, is this awkward?
I really don't do this often.

02:37.494 --> 02:40.662
What, go on dates with women
who profiled you in a magazine?

02:40.697 --> 02:42.864
Or go on dates period.
I mean, with my work schedule,

02:42.899 --> 02:44.732
I don't really have a lot of free time.

02:44.768 --> 02:46.668
But I did recently try
that Tinder application.

02:47.938 --> 02:50.605
- And how did that go?
- Not so well.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.574
So, um, that's where I'm at.

02:52.609 --> 02:53.841
How'd you end up a writer in New York?

02:53.877 --> 02:58.479
Well, I grew up in Colorado,
and I was kind of

02:58.515 --> 03:00.548
one of those nerds who always knew

03:00.584 --> 03:05.531
what I wanted to do, so then,
after college, I just... did it.

03:05.566 --> 03:06.754
I respect that.

03:06.790 --> 03:09.591
You know, believe it or not,
I was one of those nerds, too.

03:09.626 --> 03:11.726
You don't say?

03:11.761 --> 03:13.528
And...

03:13.563 --> 03:15.563
I know it's cool now
to say you were a nerd,

03:15.599 --> 03:18.566
but I really, really was one.
Then I stayed one.

03:18.602 --> 03:20.835
Which makes me resent
the nerds who became cool.

03:20.870 --> 03:23.471
Yeah, well, you seem
to be doing just fine.

03:23.506 --> 03:24.839
Yeah, I am.

03:24.874 --> 03:27.575
And you? How's the writing going?

03:28.612 --> 03:31.264
Well, um...

03:31.306 --> 03:33.035
I should probably lie

03:33.036 --> 03:36.623
and say that it's going great,
but it's not.

03:36.703 --> 03:38.487
I left a job that I
probably shouldn't have,

03:38.572 --> 03:40.038
and I got fired from another one,

03:40.073 --> 03:43.007
so now I'm just figuring things out.

03:43.043 --> 03:44.446
I'm sure you'll figure it all out.

03:44.478 --> 03:47.178
How do you know? We just met.

03:47.213 --> 03:49.747
Sometimes you just know.

03:52.952 --> 03:53.918
Thank you.

03:57.547 --> 04:00.958
Dear God, we thank you for this food,
and our blessings, Amen.

04:06.267 --> 04:08.367
I'm meeting with Jacqueline
end-of-day tomorrow,

04:08.402 --> 04:10.369
<i>and then I am all yours.</i>

04:10.404 --> 04:12.204
<i>Did you confirm the dinner rez?</i>

04:12.239 --> 04:16.108
Wait, actually, let me
just check our joint calendar.

04:16.142 --> 04:18.142
<i>Hold, please.</i>

04:18.777 --> 04:19.545
Uh...

04:20.176 --> 04:22.214
"Leila Party." Who's that?

04:22.249 --> 04:24.149
I meant to say no to that.

04:24.185 --> 04:27.152
<i>She's an old friend from when
I was running around in New York.</i>

04:27.188 --> 04:30.556
I bumped into her the other day,
and she invited me to some party.

04:30.591 --> 04:32.424
But I don't really feel like going.

04:32.460 --> 04:35.160
Oh, really?
I mean, we can if you want to.

04:35.196 --> 04:37.262
No, that's okay.

04:37.298 --> 04:39.934
I'm kind of tired of that scene, anyway.

04:39.969 --> 04:41.266
What scene is that?

04:41.302 --> 04:45.371
<i>You know, the whole New York
art world lesbian scene.</i>

04:45.406 --> 04:48.201
I don't know, actually.
That's not really my scene.

04:48.236 --> 04:50.309
You're not missing much.
We don't want to go.

04:50.344 --> 04:52.311
<i>I am going to say no.</i>

04:59.107 --> 05:02.554
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Have I ever said no?

05:02.590 --> 05:06.191
So I just got off the phone with Adena,

05:06.227 --> 05:09.954
and she was acting kind of weird
about meeting up with her old friend.

05:09.989 --> 05:13.232
- Should I be worried?
- Uh, it's hard to say.

05:13.786 --> 05:15.102
Why don't you just ask her about it?

05:15.137 --> 05:17.169
Communication is so hard.

05:17.204 --> 05:18.903
Welcome to being in a relationship.

05:18.938 --> 05:20.239
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you something now?

05:20.274 --> 05:22.408
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you get to be a Brooke?

05:24.278 --> 05:26.489
Uh, hard work and hustle?

05:26.524 --> 05:28.969
No, I work hard, I hustle.
It has to be something else.

05:29.004 --> 05:30.449
- That's true.
- Did you know that Brooke's

05:30.484 --> 05:33.419
- mom is a buyer for Barney's?
- Oh, see, there you go.

05:33.454 --> 05:35.120
The Brookes of the world
have connections.

05:35.156 --> 05:36.455
It's much easier to make it to the top

05:36.490 --> 05:39.124
- when you know the right people.
- You're right.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.226
But that's why you're going to make it.

05:41.262 --> 05:43.595
Because nobody's better
with people than you.

05:44.325 --> 05:46.198
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:51.405 --> 05:53.305
- Bye, Brooke.
- Oh, bye, Sophie.

05:53.340 --> 05:57.376
Sutton... cool. Uh, how did that go?

05:57.411 --> 06:00.479
While I prefer that we not glorify
any influencer in print,

06:00.514 --> 06:02.414
especially one who looks
like Captain Hook,

06:02.450 --> 06:04.450
that is a decision above my pay grade.

06:04.485 --> 06:06.418
But I will need you
to pull some dress options

06:06.454 --> 06:09.087
and messenger them to her apartment.

06:09.123 --> 06:10.489
Um... uh...

06:10.524 --> 06:13.759
What if I do the fitting here,
tomorrow in the morning?

06:13.814 --> 06:15.294
You're picking up Nacho
and his worm cream.

06:15.329 --> 06:17.196
Why would you want to create
extra work for yourself?

06:17.231 --> 06:19.331
This is a good experience,
and you know what they say.

06:19.366 --> 06:20.432
You can never have too many fittings.

06:20.468 --> 06:23.101
You can, and I have.

06:23.137 --> 06:25.270
But if you're feeling so inspired,
by all means.

06:31.579 --> 06:34.546
- Hey, girl.
- What's going on?

06:34.582 --> 06:36.448
Oh, you know, just sending out pitches,

06:36.484 --> 06:39.117
- slowly losing my mind.
- Mm-hmm.

06:39.153 --> 06:41.153
But I did go out for lunch with Ben,

06:41.188 --> 06:43.222
and it required me to put on pants.

06:43.257 --> 06:46.425
Ooh, the Hot Doc.
Way to bury the lede, Sloan.

06:46.460 --> 06:48.594
- How was it?
- I really like him.

06:48.629 --> 06:50.462
Yeah, and I think
I'm going to see him again.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.232
He was funny, but like,
unintentionally funny.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.400
He was easy to be around.

06:57.505 --> 06:59.171
Feels like there's a "but" coming.

06:59.206 --> 07:01.139
A big "but."

07:01.544 --> 07:04.793
He's religious.
Like, he prayed before we ate.

07:04.828 --> 07:06.211
You don't see that around New York.

07:06.247 --> 07:07.952
I'm sorry, have you met Adena?

07:07.987 --> 07:10.022
Brown skin, prays five times a day?

07:10.057 --> 07:11.016
Known to wear a head scarf?

07:11.051 --> 07:12.251
Isn't that more of a fashion statement?

07:12.286 --> 07:14.253
Well, yes, but it is also a way for her

07:14.288 --> 07:16.221
to express her Muslim faith
on her own terms.

07:16.257 --> 07:17.489
Yeah, but it's different.

07:17.525 --> 07:19.258
- Why?
- I'm not dating Adena.

07:19.293 --> 07:21.260
But you have dated
religious guys before.

07:21.295 --> 07:23.161
I mean, remember
the one from Park Slope?

07:23.197 --> 07:25.297
He made his own pickles, he was Jewish.

07:25.332 --> 07:27.232
- Oh, uh, Josh.
- Josh.

07:27.268 --> 07:31.854
Yeah, but in New York,
Judaism is like, a lifestyle choice.

07:31.889 --> 07:33.272
Veganism is a lifestyle choice.

07:33.307 --> 07:35.733
Judaism is definitely still a religion.

07:35.768 --> 07:37.509
- True.
- Jane.

07:37.545 --> 07:41.022
It feels like maybe we have
some unresolved issues?

07:41.057 --> 07:43.348
No, the one unresolved issue

07:43.384 --> 07:46.451
is how I'm going to pay
for things until I get a job.

07:52.226 --> 07:54.293
Yeah, just have the realtor
put together a list.

07:54.328 --> 07:56.170
I'll have my assistant
coordinate the viewing.

07:56.534 --> 07:57.529
Yep.

08:02.303 --> 08:05.404
- Moving, huh?
- Yeah, don't ever do it.

08:05.439 --> 08:08.540
It it mice or loud neighbors?

08:08.576 --> 08:11.410
Worse, the ghost of an ex-boyfriend.

08:11.445 --> 08:14.079
- Oh, that is worse.
- Mm-hmm.

08:14.114 --> 08:15.247
We lived together two years,

08:15.282 --> 08:17.249
and then he went
on tour with Steve Aoki.

08:17.284 --> 08:19.151
And let me tell you,
what happens on tour,

08:19.186 --> 08:20.419
doesn't always stay on tour.

08:20.454 --> 08:23.355
Thank God for antibiotics.

08:23.390 --> 08:25.257
Oh, no.

08:29.263 --> 08:31.263
You know what,
if it makes you feel any better,

08:31.298 --> 08:33.365
his music sounds like a dial-up modem.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.133
That does, actually.

08:37.171 --> 08:38.437
Yeah, but my place has bad energy now,

08:38.472 --> 08:41.106
so I'm just making a
clean break and leaving.

08:41.653 --> 08:42.975
I'm recently single too.

08:43.010 --> 08:45.243
I mean, I didn't catch him
cheating on tour or anything,

08:45.279 --> 08:47.212
but it still sucks.

08:48.449 --> 08:52.117
Yeah. It does.

08:52.152 --> 08:55.120
So maybe the two of us should
hit the town one of these days.

08:55.155 --> 08:57.289
- Make our exes jealous.
- Yeah.

08:57.324 --> 08:59.124
#YaBlewIt.

08:59.159 --> 09:00.359
Here, give me your phone.
I'll give you my number.

09:00.394 --> 09:02.294
Okay.

09:05.035 --> 09:08.053
Hi, uh, could I get another water?

09:08.088 --> 09:10.102
You need to order food
to keep your table.

09:10.137 --> 09:15.340
Okay, then I will have a mini biscotti.

09:15.376 --> 09:17.275
Yeah.

09:21.114 --> 09:22.481
Thanks.

09:29.489 --> 09:31.289
_

09:31.425 --> 09:34.426
I see you more as a dog walker,
to be honest.

09:37.164 --> 09:38.230
Hi.

09:40.827 --> 09:42.998
Jane Sloan, long time no see.

09:43.012 --> 09:45.512
Yeah, seriously, what's it been,
like, six weeks?

09:45.547 --> 09:47.647
Less if you count your
appearance on local television.

09:47.683 --> 09:49.749
Ah, yeah, my "Jerry Maguire" moment.

09:49.785 --> 09:51.551
Didn't Jerry Maguire quit his job?

09:51.587 --> 09:54.621
- Hey, too soon.
- I thought you did great.

09:54.656 --> 09:56.723
I meant to text my condolences,

09:56.758 --> 09:58.858
but I couldn't decide
on the perfect emoji.

09:58.894 --> 10:00.660
The poop one would have worked.

10:02.598 --> 10:04.698
Please, step into my office.

10:09.905 --> 10:12.706
- So, how have you been?
- Well, you know I got fired,

10:12.741 --> 10:14.541
and I'm in sweatpants, so...

10:15.944 --> 10:18.712
You look good, though.
Do you have a job interview?

10:18.747 --> 10:23.550
Oh, I had a late night.
Movie premiere, after party.

10:23.585 --> 10:24.718
After-after party.

10:24.753 --> 10:26.720
So this is last night's outfit.

10:26.755 --> 10:29.454
- Wow, congrats.
- I was working last night,

10:29.489 --> 10:30.624
as a matter of fact.

10:30.659 --> 10:32.492
I'm actually stringing for Page Six,

10:32.527 --> 10:35.762
which means, basically,
I get to go out to parties

10:35.797 --> 10:37.631
- and write about it.
- That's so cool.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.833
The best part is, my days are wide open.

10:39.868 --> 10:41.601
I've actually been working on a novel.

10:41.637 --> 10:42.936
Hm.

10:42.971 --> 10:45.772
- Thanks.
- How's the biscotti?

10:49.611 --> 10:51.478
What did you do to that guy?

10:51.513 --> 10:52.912
Um...

10:52.948 --> 10:55.548
Your gig, uh...

10:55.584 --> 10:56.883
I could do that, right?

10:59.888 --> 11:01.855
I'm sorry, what, you think I couldn't?

11:01.890 --> 11:04.524
Sloan, you're a lot of things.

11:04.559 --> 11:05.859
But a gossip writer is not one of them.

11:05.894 --> 11:07.661
What do you have that I don't?

11:07.696 --> 11:09.281
I'm charming, I know how to work a room.

11:09.316 --> 11:10.497
I'm not charming?

11:10.532 --> 11:11.731
That barista doesn't think so.

11:12.801 --> 11:15.568
This is outrageous.

11:15.604 --> 11:17.737
You know what?

11:17.773 --> 11:19.673
- I think you're scared.
- Really?

11:19.708 --> 11:21.441
Tell me what I'm scared of.

11:21.476 --> 11:22.909
You're scared that if
we go out together,

11:22.944 --> 11:24.678
I'll out-report you.

11:24.713 --> 11:27.681
Out-report me? That's not even a thing.

11:27.716 --> 11:31.551
Okay, whatever you say, scaredy cat.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.789
Okay. Come out with me tonight.

11:35.824 --> 11:39.826
If it goes well,
I'll introduce you to my editor.

11:39.861 --> 11:42.495
- Happy?
- Very.

11:42.531 --> 11:45.865
You said I'm not charming,
but I just charmed you.

11:47.969 --> 11:50.937
Honey, I'm home. What are you doing?

11:50.972 --> 11:53.606
Watching "Friends." You want to join?

11:53.642 --> 11:55.709
Well, actually, I had a different idea.

11:55.744 --> 11:57.877
I was thinking, maybe instead of dinner,

11:57.913 --> 12:00.447
we could go to your friend's party.

12:01.883 --> 12:04.784
- I told you, it's really...
- I know, it's a tired scene.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.454
But my friends are
super important to me.

12:07.489 --> 12:08.855
- Mm-hmm.
- You met them all.

12:08.890 --> 12:12.892
And I just think it'd be nice
to meet some of the people in your life.

12:12.928 --> 12:14.594
I want to know everything about you,

12:14.629 --> 12:16.429
and your people are a part of that.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.171
You make fair points.

12:20.736 --> 12:22.602
- Okay.
- Yes!

12:24.573 --> 12:25.739
I got your dress.

12:25.774 --> 12:27.540
Oh, thank you so much, I love you.

12:27.576 --> 12:28.875
I love you.

12:30.912 --> 12:33.513
So, hot date with Ben?

12:33.548 --> 12:35.482
- I'm going out with Pinstripe.
- What?

12:35.517 --> 12:38.485
It's not a date.
We're just going out for work.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.453
You're going out with Pinstripe,
and it's not a date?

12:40.489 --> 12:42.455
He told me that he
would show me the ropes

12:42.491 --> 12:44.657
of being a beat reporter.

12:44.693 --> 12:46.726
- You look like a real newsie.
- Hm.

12:46.762 --> 12:49.462
The only thing that's missing
is a hat with a card in it.

12:49.498 --> 12:50.663
It's not a date.

12:50.699 --> 12:52.766
But I am seeing Ben tomorrow, which is.

12:52.801 --> 12:54.701
Ah, I love me a good triangle.

12:54.736 --> 12:56.703
No, it is not a triangle.

12:56.738 --> 12:58.538
Triangle implies three people.

12:58.573 --> 13:00.874
Ben and I are two, so it's more of a...

13:00.909 --> 13:02.876
- A line?
- Yes, a line.

13:02.911 --> 13:04.544
- Mm-hmm.
- But I don't even know

13:04.579 --> 13:06.646
if it's a line. I like Ben, I do.

13:06.681 --> 13:08.548
I just...

13:08.583 --> 13:11.684
The religion thing,
it just still kind of bothers me.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.486
But as far as this Pinstripe hang,

13:13.522 --> 13:15.588
it is strictly platonic.

13:15.624 --> 13:17.624
So where are you going on this non-date?

13:17.659 --> 13:19.826
The Bronze Bomber.

13:19.861 --> 13:21.895
Yeah, isn't that like,
a really hard door?

13:21.930 --> 13:24.798
Yes, but Pinstripe has
an in because of his job.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.666
Do you think he could
get me and a friend in?

13:26.701 --> 13:28.635
- Who's the friend?
- Brooke Langley.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.471
Fancy, my girl
is moving up in the world.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.840
I, uh, I'm sure it's fine,
but I just asked anyway.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.443
Oh, hey, real quick,
show me your underwear.

13:36.478 --> 13:37.644
What? Why?

13:37.679 --> 13:39.479
Well, if it's really not a date,

13:39.514 --> 13:40.914
the Jane I know is wearing
full-coverage briefs,

13:40.949 --> 13:44.517
but if there is a chance that
Pinstripe might see you naked,

13:44.553 --> 13:47.587
I'm guessing you're going to
be packing a little more heat.

13:47.622 --> 13:49.489
Dump it out.

13:52.694 --> 13:54.494
- These mean nothing.
- Oh, my God.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.528
When is the last time you had a wax?

14:04.773 --> 14:07.507
Huh, so this is
how the other half lives.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.642
Well, more like one percent, but yeah.

14:09.678 --> 14:11.478
All right, we got some work to do.

14:11.513 --> 14:13.847
- Mind if I borrow her?
- Oh, please do.

14:13.882 --> 14:16.683
Okay, drinks on "Scarlet."

14:16.718 --> 14:18.651
Ooh, well, in that case,

14:18.687 --> 14:20.553
I'll have tequila,
lime juice, touch of agave.

14:20.589 --> 14:22.856
Ooh, I like your style. Excuse me.

14:22.891 --> 14:25.859
Two tequilas with lime juice
and a touch of agave.

14:25.894 --> 14:27.827
Close it out,
and I'll take the receipt, please.

14:27.863 --> 14:30.563
- One for the gram?
- Were we here if we don't?

14:30.599 --> 14:33.533
Nope.

14:34.903 --> 14:36.870
- Yes, cheekbone.
- Hey, Brooke.

14:37.182 --> 14:39.706
Hugo, oh, my God.
I haven't seen you in forever.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.641
Listen, I want you
to know that I did fight

14:41.676 --> 14:43.443
for visitation rights in the divorce.

14:43.478 --> 14:44.611
- Really?
- Yes.

14:44.646 --> 14:46.513
Oh, gosh. Sutton, this is Hugo.

14:46.548 --> 14:48.615
The only good thing to come from my ex.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.583
- He does PR for Mansur Gavriel.
- Ooh.

14:50.619 --> 14:51.851
So if you ever need
a bucket bag in coral

14:51.887 --> 14:53.920
in 24 hours for a shoot, he's your guy.

14:53.955 --> 14:56.157
Uh, 48 hours is preferred.

14:56.691 --> 14:58.658
So where would this
hypothetical bag be going?

14:58.693 --> 15:01.528
- I work for "Scarlet."
- Oh, wow.

15:01.563 --> 15:04.764
All right, teach,
so what do you actually do here?

15:04.799 --> 15:06.866
- You're about to find out.
- Oh.

15:06.902 --> 15:09.435
Noah, how goes it?

15:09.471 --> 15:11.704
Hoo-hoo, tough day at the office, huh?

15:12.807 --> 15:14.707
Thank you.

15:14.743 --> 15:16.609
So you got anything good tonight?

15:16.645 --> 15:18.444
Marion Wallace was at that table earlier

15:18.480 --> 15:21.548
- with a couple of other Knicks.
- Thanks, Noah.

15:21.583 --> 15:23.883
So do you bring a lot of dates here?

15:23.919 --> 15:26.467
Oh, do I detect a little jealousy?

15:26.502 --> 15:27.687
Uh, no.

15:27.722 --> 15:29.556
What, you're telling me
you're not dating people?

15:29.591 --> 15:32.659
I am, one person. His name is Ben.

15:32.694 --> 15:34.794
Really, it sounds like
you just made someone up,

15:34.829 --> 15:36.596
and you chose the most basic name.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.631
I'll have you know that Ben is a doctor.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.733
Ah-ha, obviously, he's a doctor.

15:40.769 --> 15:42.869
Yes, a very safe choice, very on brand.

15:42.904 --> 15:45.705
Uh, okay. Can we take it down a notch?

15:45.740 --> 15:48.641
Let's do what we came here to do, work.

15:48.677 --> 15:50.910
So you got this Wallace guy's name.

15:50.946 --> 15:53.713
- What's your next move?
- Wait for my opening.

15:53.748 --> 15:55.648
Most dudes don't like
strange guys coming up to them

15:55.684 --> 15:57.584
at clubs and interrogating them.

15:57.619 --> 16:00.453
Well, maybe they'd like me.

16:12.601 --> 16:15.401
So, that was his agent, his trainer,

16:15.437 --> 16:17.557
and a guy who I think works for Nike.

16:17.592 --> 16:18.538
Wait, why do you think that?

16:18.573 --> 16:20.406
Because he said he was a brand rep,

16:20.442 --> 16:24.577
and his watch, his shoes,
and his socks were all Nike.

16:24.613 --> 16:25.845
He's wearing white socks to a club.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.680
That should be your scandal.

16:27.716 --> 16:31.451
Nike? Wallace is an Adidas guy.

16:31.486 --> 16:33.586
Yeah, sorry,
you're literally just saying words.

16:33.622 --> 16:36.756
Jane, a New York Knick
changing his sneaker endorsement?

16:36.791 --> 16:38.691
That's a story that would sell.

16:38.727 --> 16:42.495
- Huh, I just did that.
- Somehow, you just did that.

16:51.506 --> 16:53.339
<i>♪ That's just the way you make me feel ♪</i>

16:53.475 --> 16:55.475
<i>♪ That's just the way you make me feel ♪</i>

16:55.510 --> 16:58.911
I've never seen this many
ladies in one room, ever.

16:58.947 --> 17:01.714
It's a lesbian bar.
That's kind of the point, eh?

17:01.750 --> 17:04.416
Oh, okay.

17:04.452 --> 17:07.787
So, this room, people you know,
people you don't know?

17:07.821 --> 17:09.454
People you wish you didn't know?

17:09.491 --> 17:11.657
I would say, uh, a healthy mix.

17:11.693 --> 17:15.595
Huh, okay. Oh, can I please get
a vodka soda, and a soda with a lime?

17:15.630 --> 17:17.630
Adena!

17:18.767 --> 17:20.465
Marie.

17:20.502 --> 17:23.403
This is an old friend of mine, Marie.

17:23.438 --> 17:25.538
Marie, this is my girlfriend, Kat.

17:25.573 --> 17:28.608
Girlfriend? Adena's off the market?

17:28.643 --> 17:31.744
Marie jokes, in Istanbul,
she couldn't get rid of me fast enough.

17:31.780 --> 17:34.580
- Memories are so subjective.
- Yeah.

17:34.616 --> 17:35.782
You traveled Turkey together?

17:35.817 --> 17:37.517
Yeah, remember, I sent you pictures.

17:37.552 --> 17:38.685
Yeah, no, I remember it.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.752
I don't remember seeing any of Marie.

17:39.788 --> 17:41.521
Can I borrow?

17:41.556 --> 17:43.623
Our friends in the corner
are getting jealous.

17:43.658 --> 17:45.525
Yeah, sure, no, you go.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.560
I'll get the drinks
and I'll come find you.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.872
You must be Kat.

17:59.908 --> 18:01.808
Yeah, hi, I'm sorry,
do we know each other?

18:01.843 --> 18:03.609
I'm Leila, I'm friends with Adena.

18:03.645 --> 18:05.445
Oh, right, Leila.

18:05.480 --> 18:06.846
She mentioned she had a girlfriend,

18:06.881 --> 18:08.748
that she was bringing her.
I put two and two together.

18:08.783 --> 18:12.585
Right, this is your party.
Learning a lot tonight.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.421
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes, believe it or not.

18:15.457 --> 18:16.589
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:16.624 --> 18:17.824
Well, it's great.

18:17.859 --> 18:20.860
There's a mix of fashion,
art, music people.

18:20.895 --> 18:23.563
All of whom seem to know
Adena's in town.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.467
I'm way too jealous for that.

18:29.437 --> 18:30.603
What do you mean?

18:30.638 --> 18:32.605
They're mostly just friends, right?

18:32.640 --> 18:36.776
Oh, yeah, no, of course. Just friends.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.778
Right.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.332
Okay, thanks!

18:48.886 --> 18:52.528
Nike's official comment is "no comment."

18:52.564 --> 18:54.330
Which means it's true.

18:56.501 --> 18:59.669
Well, a promise is a promise.
I will call my editor

18:59.704 --> 19:03.306
and tell him I found a great
new party reporter,

19:03.341 --> 19:04.440
and we'll set up a meeting.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.242
Uh, could you make it a lunch?

19:06.277 --> 19:08.344
I'm trying to get as much
free food as possible.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.679
Definitely.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.450
Did you just send Dr. Ben
straight to voicemail?

19:14.486 --> 19:15.685
We're working, so...

19:15.720 --> 19:18.621
Oh, I hope you're not letting this

19:18.657 --> 19:20.657
get in the way of that.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.626
- Trust me, it's not.
- On that note,

19:23.662 --> 19:25.929
I'm going home to have a nap.

19:25.964 --> 19:26.696
I thought that you were supposed to be

19:26.731 --> 19:29.118
working on your novel
while I write pitches.

19:29.153 --> 19:30.466
Daddy needs his beauty rest.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.602
There's a party happening
tonight at Bronze Bomber again.

19:32.637 --> 19:34.370
If you want to come keep our

19:34.406 --> 19:35.672
Woodward and Bernstein routine going.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.407
Might help you get the job.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.342
Uh, first of all, please don't ever

19:39.377 --> 19:42.679
call yourself "Daddy" again,
and I appreciate the offer,

19:42.714 --> 19:44.414
but I am seeing Ben tonight.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.648
Text me if you change your mind.

19:51.322 --> 19:52.555
Have a good nap.

19:52.590 --> 19:55.692
- I'm hungover.
- All right, take this.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.660
- And this.
- Stop yelling.

19:57.696 --> 19:59.696
I was feeling bad
about bailing last night,

19:59.731 --> 20:02.598
but now I'm feeling like I made
exactly the right choice.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.357
Oh, how was baby's first lesbian bar?

20:05.392 --> 20:06.335
Still processing it.

20:07.572 --> 20:09.305
- _
- Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

20:09.340 --> 20:10.540
What?

20:10.575 --> 20:13.543
Oh, what, is her liver made of Teflon?

20:14.484 --> 20:15.478
_

20:15.513 --> 20:17.513
Oh, okay, round two, savage.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.550
Yeah, well, it's really hard
keeping up with you.

20:20.585 --> 20:22.752
Me? I never leave my apartment.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.587
We've been working here
for the same amount of time.

20:24.622 --> 20:25.755
You're the head of a department.

20:25.790 --> 20:27.657
I'm still an assistant.

20:27.692 --> 20:29.625
I love that you're crushing it,

20:29.661 --> 20:31.327
but I want to be crushing it too.

20:31.362 --> 20:33.496
Hey, you are crushing it, okay?

20:33.531 --> 20:35.531
It's just, there's a lot
more people trying to make it

20:35.567 --> 20:37.433
in fashion than in social media.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.469
Exactly, which is why I have
to take bigger swings.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.404
I connected with more people last night

20:41.439 --> 20:42.739
than I have in the past six months.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.440
I mean, if this is what it takes.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.375
Yeah, maybe take some of this, too.

20:52.717 --> 20:55.451
Hey, thank you again
for making us go last night.

20:55.487 --> 20:58.387
I know I complained,
but it was fun to see everyone.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.656
Yeah, I had fun meeting your friends.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.592
It was good.

21:02.627 --> 21:07.597
You know, I actually had no idea
you had so many friends.

21:07.632 --> 21:13.603
So many sexy, beautiful friends.

21:13.638 --> 21:15.671
Why are you saying "friends" like that?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.573
I mean, come on,
you could field a softball team

21:17.609 --> 21:19.642
with the amount of girls
you had slept with in that room.

21:19.677 --> 21:23.479
I've never played softball, so...

21:23.515 --> 21:25.481
I'm serious, though,
like, what's your number?

21:25.517 --> 21:28.484
How many women have you slept with?

21:28.520 --> 21:31.554
Kat, I don't ask you how many
people you've been with.

21:31.589 --> 21:33.456
You could, and I'd tell you.

21:33.491 --> 21:36.692
Open communication is good
in relationships, I'm told.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.427
To me, the past is in the past.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.629
It has no bearing on the future.

21:39.664 --> 21:41.764
Uh, okay.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.534
I'm with you now.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.806
Is that not enough?

21:49.841 --> 21:53.643
Yes, I mean, of course it is,
but, you know...

21:58.650 --> 22:00.683
Oh, yeah, so you know I would,

22:00.718 --> 22:02.618
but I'm going to be late
for dinner with Sutton,

22:02.654 --> 22:05.454
and you know I'm always late, and...

22:05.490 --> 22:07.623
Wait, are you really
trying to distract me

22:07.659 --> 22:10.626
- like this right now?
- Is it working?

22:10.662 --> 22:12.628
Um...

22:12.664 --> 22:14.630
Well...

22:21.773 --> 22:24.473
- Ben or Pinstripe?
- Hm?

22:24.509 --> 22:26.409
- Girl, triangle.
- Girl, line.

22:26.444 --> 22:28.411
♪ Triangle ♪

22:28.446 --> 22:30.433
- Enough.
- Hey, what's up?

22:30.468 --> 22:31.581
Jane's just trying to convince me

22:31.616 --> 22:33.783
that she's not into Pinstripe,
even though she's texting him

22:33.818 --> 22:35.718
before Ben comes to pick
her up for their date.

22:35.753 --> 22:38.354
Exactly, I am texting Pinstripe,

22:38.389 --> 22:40.323
but I am seeing Ben tonight.

22:40.358 --> 22:42.592
Methinks m'lady protests too much.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.728
Ugh, me thinks nothing.

22:45.763 --> 22:48.364
You know, Ryan and I get along,

22:48.399 --> 22:50.566
but he's kind of a player.

22:50.602 --> 22:51.801
But you would be into him if he wasn't?

22:51.836 --> 22:54.370
It's moot, because he is.

22:54.405 --> 22:56.372
I'm going out with Ben, and I like him.

22:56.407 --> 22:59.709
He's handsome, and smart,

22:59.744 --> 23:04.380
and he believes in his job,
and his community, and...

23:04.415 --> 23:07.617
Okay, God, but that shouldn't
keep me from giving him a chance.

23:07.652 --> 23:09.719
And yet, you keep bringing it up.

23:09.754 --> 23:14.290
I just think that religious people
can be kind of judge-y.

23:14.325 --> 23:16.392
She says, judgingly.

23:16.427 --> 23:18.327
Your cheeks are flush.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.498
You just had sex, didn't you?

23:22.533 --> 23:24.567
God, she's like
a truffle pig for hookups.

23:24.602 --> 23:26.736
And speaking of, um,

23:26.771 --> 23:28.734
how many people
have you guys slept with?

23:28.769 --> 23:29.372
- Four.
- 28.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.773
- Makes sense.
- Yours too.

23:30.808 --> 23:33.542
And have you ever not told
a guy when he asked you?

23:33.578 --> 23:34.744
Well, I once got embarrassed,

23:34.779 --> 23:36.579
and said that my number was five.

23:36.614 --> 23:39.415
- You are so adorable.
- You know what Adena said?

23:39.450 --> 23:41.484
- The past is the past.
- Oh!

23:41.519 --> 23:44.320
My college boyfriend once told me that

23:44.355 --> 23:49.325
when I asked him if he had hooked up
with anybody in Cancun. It's never good.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.495
Well, I mean, uh,
what are we counting as sex?

23:52.530 --> 23:54.797
You know, I actually don't know
what lesbians count as sex.

23:54.832 --> 23:56.799
See, my 28 is a strict interpretation,

23:56.834 --> 23:59.535
because once you get
into oral and hand stuff,

23:59.570 --> 24:01.404
I'm going to need a bigger boat.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.539
Honestly, I don't even really
care what her number is.

24:03.574 --> 24:05.741
I just want to be able to talk
to her about it, you know,

24:05.777 --> 24:08.644
and get to know her better,
and get to know her world better.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.546
Well, have you said this to her?

24:10.581 --> 24:13.482
That's the problem.
I tried, but she just keeps

24:13.518 --> 24:15.318
avoiding the issue, you know?

24:15.353 --> 24:17.132
It makes me feel like
she's hiding something.

24:17.167 --> 24:18.487
Well, what could she be hiding?

24:18.523 --> 24:20.756
Well, I don't know,
what was Cancun bae hiding?

24:25.596 --> 24:27.697
How about "za"?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.565
Short for pizza.

24:31.042 --> 24:32.435
Isn't that an official word?

24:32.470 --> 24:35.638
Um, maybe in the Outback,
but not in my house.

24:35.673 --> 24:40.343
Well, feel free to challenge.

24:40.378 --> 24:42.578
I'm glad we stayed in. This is fun.

24:42.613 --> 24:45.681
Yeah, so am I.

24:49.336 --> 24:53.789
Wow, I would not have
pegged you as the tattoo type.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.425
Oh, yeah, I got it after my residency.

24:56.461 --> 24:57.426
I like it.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.668
I can't tell if you're confused
about a doctor having a tattoo,

25:05.703 --> 25:08.504
- or the tattoo itself.
- Both.

25:08.539 --> 25:11.273
It's just, you know,
you went to medical school.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.742
I guess that I just
wouldn't think that somebody

25:12.777 --> 25:15.378
that educated and scientific would...

25:15.413 --> 25:18.547
- Have faith?
- Yeah.

25:18.583 --> 25:22.318
Well, working in a hospital
can be rough.

25:22.353 --> 25:25.521
Illness is terrible,
so it's nice to have faith, it helps.

25:25.556 --> 25:27.289
Nice for who?

25:27.325 --> 25:28.624
I mean, if I were in a hospital,

25:28.659 --> 25:33.396
I would rather my life depend
on good health care than prayer.

25:33.431 --> 25:37.533
Well, the faith isn't for my patients,
Jane; it's for me.

25:37.568 --> 25:39.368
Right.

25:44.609 --> 25:46.900
Uh, sorry,
I'm just trying to understand.

25:46.935 --> 25:51.327
So you, a rational human being
with eight years of school

25:51.362 --> 25:52.648
under your belt, you actually think

25:52.683 --> 25:56.619
that up there sits a god who
cannot only hear your prayers,

25:56.654 --> 25:59.208
but act on them and make
sick people better?

26:00.324 --> 26:02.525
We don't have to talk about this.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.326
You're right, we don't.

26:12.435 --> 26:14.623
Hey, hey, just hear me out, okay?

26:14.624 --> 26:17.791
According to Facebook, Adena left Marie,

26:17.827 --> 26:19.827
and immediately started
dating someone else.

26:19.862 --> 26:21.562
- Okay, we're still here?
- Yes.

26:21.597 --> 26:23.631
I mean, you see the problem, right?

26:23.666 --> 26:24.832
No.

26:24.867 --> 26:26.667
It's not the number of partners.

26:26.702 --> 26:28.769
It's the number of relationships.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.771
Like, serious relationships.
That's way worse.

26:30.806 --> 26:32.740
And how is that worse?

26:32.775 --> 26:36.510
Because she just moves
from one to the next.

26:36.546 --> 26:38.479
It's like musical chairs.
The music stops,

26:38.514 --> 26:41.515
and then, she just slides on in
to the next available seat.

26:41.551 --> 26:44.752
Okay, well, maybe,
but maybe that was her past.

26:44.787 --> 26:47.688
No, Sutton, she was dating
Coco when we met.

26:47.723 --> 26:51.692
How do I know she's not lining up
someone new like, right now?

26:51.727 --> 26:52.826
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.428
What happened to Ben?

26:54.463 --> 26:56.530
Uh, don't want to talk about it.

26:56.566 --> 26:59.767
Um, I'm actually
going out to meet Pinstripe.

26:59.802 --> 27:01.802
- Huh.
- Okay.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.572
- Where are you guys going?
- To Bronze Bomber again.

27:04.607 --> 27:06.373
Brooke and I are going
there tonight too.

27:06.409 --> 27:07.808
All right, well,
you guys have a great night.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.677
- I think I'm just going to...
- No.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.612
I'm not letting you stay
home and self-sabotage.

27:11.647 --> 27:14.481
You're coming with us,
and you can invite Adena.

27:14.517 --> 27:15.683
Smooth things over.

27:16.786 --> 27:17.818
Fine.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.658
- Oh.
- Huh.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.661
Oh, there's Brooke,
I'm going to go say hi.

27:27.697 --> 27:29.597
I'm going to go look for the restroom.

27:29.632 --> 27:32.533
Oh, okay, we'll be at the bar.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.436
Wow, this is a pretty sweet gig.

27:35.471 --> 27:37.538
Yeah, you know,
there are worse ways to make a living

27:37.573 --> 27:38.772
- than writing about fancy parties.
- _

27:38.808 --> 27:40.708
It's true, but you're a fancy lady.

27:40.743 --> 27:42.376
- That's why it works.
- Thanks.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.544
You're welcome.

27:49.752 --> 27:53.387
- You good?
- Yeah.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.790
Everything is...

27:56.826 --> 27:59.627
chill.

27:59.662 --> 28:02.429
Seriously, it smelled
like omelets and regret.

28:02.465 --> 28:03.764
I can't even... Sutton!

28:03.799 --> 28:05.766
- Hi, what's up?
- Oh, my God, girl.

28:05.801 --> 28:07.534
- It's been too long.
- I know.

28:07.570 --> 28:08.669
What, like, eight hours?

28:10.573 --> 28:12.339
Um, you guys, this is Sutton.
She is going to run

28:12.375 --> 28:13.440
the "Scarlet"
fashion department one day.

28:13.476 --> 28:15.342
Oh, well, a girl can dream.

28:15.378 --> 28:17.478
Everybody looks like
they need a drink, though.

28:17.513 --> 28:20.347
- Next round on "Scarlet"?
- Hmm, that's sweet.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.721
- Hello?
- Hi.

28:27.757 --> 28:30.357
- Be easy.
- Oh, Jane.

28:30.393 --> 28:32.726
I'm easy. Look, so easy.

28:32.762 --> 28:34.461
She's just talking to

28:34.497 --> 28:35.796
a really beautiful woman.

28:35.831 --> 28:37.698
Hey, it's nothing.

28:37.733 --> 28:39.500
You're so right, it's nothing.
I'll be right back.

28:39.535 --> 28:40.734
Oh, no.

28:44.507 --> 28:47.574
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

28:47.610 --> 28:50.477
- Who's your friend?
- Ah, Vanessa.

28:50.513 --> 28:54.381
She runs a gallery in Chelsea.
I've known her for years.

28:54.417 --> 28:55.382
Cool.

28:57.191 --> 29:00.387
Baby, she's married.
To a war photographer.

29:00.423 --> 29:02.556
Who is a man.

29:02.591 --> 29:04.358
Right, I...

29:05.761 --> 29:09.430
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm kind of spinning out right now.

29:09.465 --> 29:12.399
I'm not a jealous or insecure person.

29:12.435 --> 29:14.535
But you know,
the way you're handling this

29:14.570 --> 29:17.571
is really starting to change that.

29:18.316 --> 29:19.506
Handling what?

29:21.444 --> 29:24.611
It's... it's that. It's exactly that.

29:24.647 --> 29:27.348
I'm asking you really basic
questions about your past,

29:27.383 --> 29:28.816
and you just play dumb.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.418
I've been with more people
than you, Kat.

29:31.454 --> 29:34.388
I thought that I was being considerate
not talking about it.

29:34.423 --> 29:35.723
I'm sorry for trying to protect you.

29:35.758 --> 29:37.558
I actually don't need your protection.

29:37.593 --> 29:40.561
What I need from you is your honesty.

29:40.596 --> 29:42.830
And I need to feel
like I can talk to you

29:42.865 --> 29:44.732
without feeling like a crazy person,

29:44.767 --> 29:46.767
which is exactly how
Coco must have felt.

29:55.611 --> 29:57.578
I'm going to go get a drink.

30:00.449 --> 30:03.384
I bet you get a lot
of famous people in here.

30:03.419 --> 30:05.452
Well, that guy in the corner
is on the news.

30:13.629 --> 30:16.530
Oh, my God.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.432
I thought that my hands were corn dogs,

30:18.467 --> 30:20.534
and I wound up in the bathroom
at the end of the night.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.636
Which is why I don't eat
petit fours anymore.

30:22.671 --> 30:23.871
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, that's so gross.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.639
Is it weird I want a corn dog, though?

30:26.876 --> 30:27.875
Oh, thanks for the drinks, Sutton.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.710
Yeah, thank you.

30:29.745 --> 30:33.480
So, guys,
what do we think about the Bowery?

30:33.516 --> 30:34.681
- Hm, it's cool, yeah.
- Yeah, still cool?

30:34.717 --> 30:35.816
- There's a party there.
- Let's do it.

30:35.851 --> 30:37.684
Sutton, you in?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.586
Um, actually,
can I talk to you really quick?

30:39.622 --> 30:41.455
Oh. Yeah.

30:42.625 --> 30:44.491
- Um...
- What's up?

30:44.527 --> 30:46.894
There is a $500
miscellaneous charge on the bill.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.729
Do you know what that is?

30:48.764 --> 30:50.831
Yeah, yeah, I mean...

30:52.768 --> 30:54.501
Oh, okay, so, one of the owners,

30:54.537 --> 30:56.670
he put a few party favors on the bill.

30:56.705 --> 30:59.473
It's like, so much easier
than cash, you know?

30:59.508 --> 31:01.542
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:01.577 --> 31:04.545
I see, so, I don't think I can put that

31:04.580 --> 31:07.748
- on my company card, though.
- Mm.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.483
So that's why it's
labeled miscellaneous.

31:09.518 --> 31:11.485
It's like, totally hidden.

31:11.520 --> 31:15.489
Um, well, it's still $800, so...

31:16.525 --> 31:19.393
Oh, my God, you're... Oh, sweetie.

31:19.428 --> 31:20.694
Oh, you're so worried.

31:20.729 --> 31:22.629
No, okay, look, this is how it works.

31:22.665 --> 31:24.565
It's fine, I do this
all the time with editors.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.633
- It's just never an issue.
- Right.

31:26.669 --> 31:28.635
Yeah, trust me.

31:28.671 --> 31:31.572
Um, can you just excuse me
for one second, okay?

31:37.121 --> 31:40.721
_

31:44.288 --> 31:46.288
- Hi, we need to talk.
- Okay.

31:48.392 --> 31:50.592
- Wait, what's going on?
- Where's Kat?

31:50.628 --> 31:54.329
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what's up?

31:54.365 --> 31:55.364
Sorry for the emergency huddle,

31:55.399 --> 31:57.499
but I have a major problem.

31:57.535 --> 32:01.470
Brooke just put $500 worth
of cocaine on my "Scarlet" card.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.305
- What, how?
- Oh, my God, I don't know.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.407
It just happened,
and I didn't know what to say.

32:05.442 --> 32:08.163
How about, hey guys, sorry,
but I can't expense narcotics?

32:08.198 --> 32:10.579
Yeah, that would have been great,
but the thing is,

32:10.614 --> 32:12.842
I just started getting in with Brooke.

32:12.877 --> 32:14.316
I didn't want it to
jeopardize the friendship.

32:14.351 --> 32:16.585
Well, if it jeopardizes it,
then it's not a friendship.

32:16.620 --> 32:20.289
I know, but Oliver did say
that I could use the card

32:20.324 --> 32:21.490
to get to know people.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.358
Oh, cabs and work drinks, Sutton!

32:23.394 --> 32:24.593
Kat, you come back from vacation,

32:24.628 --> 32:26.595
and you somehow
have more responsibility.

32:26.630 --> 32:29.698
I still spend half of my day
reorganizing the fashion closet.

32:29.733 --> 32:31.533
Maybe talk to Oliver about it.

32:31.569 --> 32:35.470
- Or pay for it yourself.
- I don't have the money.

32:37.575 --> 32:38.540
Ugh.

32:41.579 --> 32:43.512
Oh, look, Pinstripe.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.649
- I'll be back.
- Yep.

32:56.293 --> 32:57.559
Well, there she is.

32:57.595 --> 33:00.228
Look who finally decided
to show up to work.

33:00.264 --> 33:01.597
Oh, I was just giving you a head start.

33:01.632 --> 33:03.498
- Oh.
- So, get any good scoops?

33:03.534 --> 33:05.434
Actually, yes.

33:05.469 --> 33:08.370
It appears that Chad Horford,
the New York 14 news anchor

33:08.405 --> 33:11.273
that interviewed me
is cheating on his wife.

33:11.308 --> 33:14.102
Whoa, I just saw him
with her at a charity event.

33:14.137 --> 33:16.678
She's six months pregnant.
That's a good story, Sloan.

33:16.714 --> 33:20.582
Wait, what? Is it?

33:21.201 --> 33:23.218
I don't know, I mean...

33:23.253 --> 33:25.687
A cheating story is one thing.

33:25.723 --> 33:29.224
But doesn't the pregnancy thing
make it feel kind of dirty?

33:29.259 --> 33:30.525
It makes it feel scandalous,

33:30.561 --> 33:33.228
and that's what we're
trying to sell here.

33:33.263 --> 33:35.397
Yeah, but you're going
to ruin these people's lives.

33:35.432 --> 33:37.299
Me? It was your story.

33:37.334 --> 33:39.568
And now I'm telling you
that it feels wrong.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.370
Look, this guy's being a jerk,

33:41.405 --> 33:44.539
and we're calling him out.
This is part of the job.

33:44.575 --> 33:46.241
Well, if that's part of the job,

33:46.276 --> 33:48.377
then maybe I don't want to do it.

33:48.412 --> 33:50.312
I mean, you have
to draw the line somewhere.

33:50.347 --> 33:53.682
Ouch, I didn't realize
I was lacking a moral center.

33:53.717 --> 33:55.550
I'm sorry.

33:55.586 --> 33:57.719
I obviously appreciate you helping me,

33:57.755 --> 34:01.356
but I mean, are you happy doing this?

34:01.392 --> 34:02.658
Chasing gossip stories?

34:02.693 --> 34:04.559
I know what kind of
writer you want to be.

34:04.595 --> 34:07.529
- It's not this.
- That's what the novel is for.

34:07.564 --> 34:10.297
- What?
- Come on, Ryan, really?

34:10.333 --> 34:12.400
How much are you
actually working on that?

34:12.436 --> 34:14.302
It's okay if you want to party,
but don't couch it

34:14.338 --> 34:16.237
as some incredible work opportunity.

34:16.273 --> 34:19.206
Well, if you find my life
so distasteful,

34:19.243 --> 34:20.475
then why are you out with me

34:20.511 --> 34:22.543
and not on your date
with the good doctor?

34:24.581 --> 34:28.449
That's a good question. Thank you.

34:28.485 --> 34:31.253
You're right; he is a good guy.

34:33.424 --> 34:35.389
Jane.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.560
She has potential.

34:40.431 --> 34:43.281
- Hey, so it turns out...
- Where have you been hiding?

34:43.315 --> 34:44.607
So, the thing is,
I don't think that I can...

34:44.641 --> 34:45.877
Dude, Sutton, I was just telling Quinn

34:45.911 --> 34:47.210
that you have to come
to our next dinner party.

34:47.245 --> 34:48.370
They are legendary.

34:48.405 --> 34:51.273
Like, literally every fashion
designer fights for an invite.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.708
You will seriously love it.

34:53.318 --> 34:55.243
Oh, oh, guys, the car's here.

34:55.279 --> 34:57.245
Let's go. Hey, come on.

34:57.281 --> 34:58.246
Okay.

34:59.316 --> 35:01.383
We'll wait for you outside.

35:06.623 --> 35:08.590
Love a dinner.

35:18.635 --> 35:20.535
Thanks for coming over.

35:20.571 --> 35:23.605
Look, I owe you an explanation

35:23.640 --> 35:26.241
about how I reacted earlier.

35:26.276 --> 35:28.677
Um...

35:28.712 --> 35:31.213
It didn't come out of nowhere.

35:35.552 --> 35:39.688
When I was little, my mom got cancer.

35:39.723 --> 35:43.425
And she was pretty religious.

35:43.460 --> 35:45.627
But even more so after the diagnosis.

35:46.334 --> 35:48.396
I would go visit her,
and she would tell me

35:48.432 --> 35:52.534
to pray and that it
would make it better.

35:52.569 --> 35:56.671
At the funeral, um,
the priest came up to me

35:56.707 --> 36:00.275
and he took my hands,
and he looked me in the eye,

36:00.310 --> 36:02.611
and he said...

36:02.646 --> 36:05.380
"It's okay, Jane.

36:05.415 --> 36:08.250
God has taken your mom
to a better place."

36:10.454 --> 36:14.256
And I just remember thinking...

36:14.291 --> 36:18.293
I... I prayed to God
to keep her here with me.

36:20.664 --> 36:23.532
Because what better place is there?

36:24.694 --> 36:27.435
Jane, I'm so sorry.

36:32.676 --> 36:36.611
So, um, yeah,
that's kind of when I stopped believing

36:36.647 --> 36:39.514
in the magic power of God.

36:39.550 --> 36:41.383
That's awful.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.386
Thank you so much for telling me.

36:49.326 --> 36:52.394
You know,
you don't have to believe in God

36:52.429 --> 36:54.496
to have faith that you're
going to be okay, Jane.

36:56.366 --> 36:58.466
- Have you always been religious?
- Yes and no.

36:58.502 --> 36:59.668
I mean, when I was growing up,

36:59.703 --> 37:02.304
my parents sent me to Sunday school,

37:02.339 --> 37:05.207
bible camp, the whole thing.

37:05.242 --> 37:06.474
And then, I moved
halfway across the world

37:06.510 --> 37:09.177
to go to college and rejected it all.

37:09.213 --> 37:11.313
But once I started at the hospital,
I don't know.

37:11.348 --> 37:13.615
It just kind of clicked back in.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.220
Yeah.

37:18.255 --> 37:21.623
I guess that's just kind of hard for me
to wrap my head around.

37:21.658 --> 37:25.460
And it made me judge you unfairly.

37:25.495 --> 37:27.462
Yeah.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.664
Leave the judgment to God,
Jane, and you'll be fine.

37:32.436 --> 37:33.635
Oh, God.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.673
I'm glad you called me back tonight.

37:38.709 --> 37:40.675
Me too.

37:52.589 --> 37:54.489
Um...

37:54.524 --> 37:58.660
Just before we take this
relationship any further,

37:58.695 --> 38:02.163
what is your stance on premarital sex?

38:04.534 --> 38:07.369
- I think we're good.
- Okay.

38:21.548 --> 38:23.248
Kat!

38:23.283 --> 38:24.683
Can you just talk to me?

38:26.420 --> 38:28.386
Look.

38:28.422 --> 38:31.456
If it's more bullshit about
the past being the past

38:31.491 --> 38:34.459
and all of that,
then I'm not really interested.

38:34.494 --> 38:37.462
- Thanks, anyway.
- It's not.

38:39.333 --> 38:41.466
You're right.

38:41.501 --> 38:43.635
I haven't been totally honest with you.

38:43.670 --> 38:48.640
And it's not because
I've been trying to protect you.

38:48.675 --> 38:54.312
I'm trying to protect myself, because...

38:54.348 --> 38:57.349
because I'm scared.

38:57.384 --> 38:59.250
What are you scared of?

39:00.687 --> 39:07.425
I'm in a relationship in a country
that does not want me.

39:07.461 --> 39:11.529
My mother turns 60 next week,

39:11.565 --> 39:13.264
and I can't leave to go visit her.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.532
I...

39:14.568 --> 39:16.668
I don't know if I'll
be able to come back.

39:16.703 --> 39:18.436
Why wouldn't you just
tell me that, though?

39:18.472 --> 39:21.206
Because I don't want you to feel guilty.

39:21.241 --> 39:24.209
And I don't want to scare you off.

39:24.244 --> 39:28.313
But I'm... I'm choosing to be here, Kat.

39:28.348 --> 39:30.648
I'm choosing you.

39:35.722 --> 39:38.289
Thank you for saying that.

39:38.325 --> 39:42.427
Then, let me say one more thing.

39:49.369 --> 39:51.569
I love you, Kat.

39:53.673 --> 39:55.640
I love you too.

40:01.548 --> 40:04.416
Hey, um...

40:04.451 --> 40:06.651
Will you, uh...

40:06.686 --> 40:10.355
finally tell me how many
people you've slept with?

40:12.726 --> 40:15.693
- Please.
- A lot.

40:15.729 --> 40:17.562
Yeah, no, that's good,
that'll work for now,

40:17.597 --> 40:20.698
but I will get an actual number one day.

40:30.790 --> 40:33.010
