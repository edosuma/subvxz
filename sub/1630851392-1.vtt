01:19.997 --> 01:21.288
- Hey, babe.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.623
Can you come in
here for a second?

01:22.666 --> 01:24.666
I need to ask you a
question about the wedding.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.919
- Am I in trouble?

01:26.962 --> 01:28.629
- Well, that depends.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.880
Did you and Wyatt go
over to Carrie's shop

01:29.924 --> 01:31.799
to get the final fitting?

01:31.842 --> 01:34.093
- Wyatt has been very
hard to pin down,

01:34.136 --> 01:35.385
but I will get it taken care of.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.887
I promise.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.639
Anything else?

01:38.682 --> 01:39.932
- Do we look good together?

01:42.561 --> 01:43.602
- Yeah, we do.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.146
I love you.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.981
- Love you too.

01:48.818 --> 01:49.608
Oh, your phone's ringing.

01:49.652 --> 01:50.442
- Oh, shoot.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.954
Hello?

02:01.997 --> 02:02.955
- Is this
Professor Dardenswick?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.164
- Yes, this is Jeff Dardenswick.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.415
I was wondering

02:05.459 --> 02:07.376
if yesterday's exam
scores will be posted.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.461
- Yes, the exams will
be posted online.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.462
Do you know when?

02:10.506 --> 02:11.880
I'm a little worried.

02:11.924 --> 02:14.049
- My assistant Dylan
said by end of the week.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.300
Thank you so much.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.260
- You're welcome.

02:16.303 --> 02:16.969
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.889
Almost done with the
online announcement?

02:20.933 --> 02:21.807
- Almost.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.310
And done.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.772
Okay, it's ready to send.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.357
- It's gonna get crazy.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.525
- Wait, do I send
it or not send it?

02:31.569 --> 02:33.569
You said the crazier,
the better, right?

02:33.612 --> 02:34.444
- Send it.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.159
Ooh, there it goes!

02:42.997 --> 02:43.871
What are you doing?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.789
Waiting for the crazy to start.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.166
- Well, sir,

02:47.209 --> 02:50.085
you can stop waiting because
you are already crazy.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.003
- Oh?

02:52.882 --> 02:55.465
- Mm, so sorry.
- That was mean, that was mean.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.514
- Announcing Macy
and Jeff Dardenswick?

03:04.310 --> 03:06.435
He's been mine
since we were kids!

03:07.479 --> 03:10.856
God, how could I
let this happen?!

03:14.737 --> 03:16.111
- Okay,
Carrie, be honest.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.487
How do you think this looks?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.700
- You look gorgeous.

03:21.744 --> 03:23.202
- Thanks.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.203
I mean, this is a contender,

03:24.246 --> 03:26.788
but can I see a ballgown?

03:26.832 --> 03:27.623
- Of course.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.457
I'll go pull it.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.291
- Thanks.

03:37.301 --> 03:38.342
- Hi.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.468
If you'll just
give me one minute,

03:39.511 --> 03:40.052
I'll be right with you.

03:40.095 --> 03:40.928
- Oh, no hurry.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.179
I'll just take a look around.

03:42.223 --> 03:42.888
Take your time.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.306
- Thank you so much.

03:44.350 --> 03:45.432
Okay, Macy.

03:45.476 --> 03:48.685
Try this on and
see what you think.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.853
- Busy day, huh?

03:49.897 --> 03:52.272
- Yes, I am hoping it is.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.274
We could use a few
busy days around here.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.108
- Listen, I'll be fine.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.818
Go help the other customers.

03:56.862 --> 03:57.945
I'm not going anywhere.

03:57.988 --> 03:58.904
- Okay, thank you.

03:58.948 --> 03:59.821
I'll be right back.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.075
- Hey, Jordy.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.201
Come take a look at this dress.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.077
- Oh, yes.

04:06.789 --> 04:07.537
- What do you think?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.497
- Oh, I love.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.414
- Do you?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.249
- Yes.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.333
- Is it too much up here?

04:11.377 --> 04:13.168
Like bling and--

04:13.212 --> 04:14.127
- No, not at all.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.545
- Are you sure?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.672
- Total princess.

04:16.715 --> 04:17.589
Very classy.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.217
- It is really pretty.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.343
- Yeah.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.594
Aw, you're gonna
look like a princess.

04:22.638 --> 04:23.887
- I don't know.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.805
I'm not sure about
the strapless.

04:24.848 --> 04:26.014
It seems too much.

04:26.058 --> 04:26.848
You're right,

04:26.892 --> 04:27.808
I'm getting ahead of myself.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.268
- I'm so sorry for the delay.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.352
How can I help you?

04:30.396 --> 04:31.603
- Maybe I can help you.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.771
I'm a wedding planner.

04:32.815 --> 04:34.106
I saw your information online

04:34.149 --> 04:35.148
and thought maybe I'd drop by

04:35.192 --> 04:37.442
to see if you could
use some help.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.778
- Nice to meet you, but
I can't afford any help.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.238
- Oh, you won't pay me.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.949
I'll give you a piece of all
the wedding planning I do.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.368
I just need a place with
resources like your shop.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.494
- Gosh.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.788
Well, that actually
sounds great.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.790
- I'm Amy, Amy McGraw.

04:51.834 --> 04:52.708
- Amy, I'm Carrie.

04:52.751 --> 04:53.625
- Oh no!

04:54.628 --> 04:55.669
- I'm so clumsy.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.586
- I've got this.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.671
- Thank you.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.215
Gosh, the shop is
so busy right now.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.800
Can you give me your
card and I'll call you?

05:01.844 --> 05:02.592
- Certainly.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.471
Make sure you call me, Carrie.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.723
This can change your life.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.224
I promise.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.101
- Well, I could use the change.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.228
Okay, I'll call you as
soon as I get a chance.

05:16.108 --> 05:16.940
All right.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.066
How are you doing?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.484
- Good, I
think I like this one,

05:19.528 --> 05:21.069
but I'm not sold on it yet.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.698
This hike was a great idea.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.535
- I thought
you could use a break.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.579
- I'm doing
the best I can.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.497
- Mace, you're doing great,

05:32.541 --> 05:33.915
but you need help planning.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.584
And if you don't get help soon,

05:35.627 --> 05:38.754
your wedding is gonna
be all work and no fun.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.714
- Yeah, but I can't
afford any help.

05:41.925 --> 05:45.177
- I could help and I'm
not that expensive.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.553
- No.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.763
I'm not gonna ask you

05:47.806 --> 05:49.931
to spend all your time
planning my wedding.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.391
- I'm not asking.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.684
I'm telling you.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.685
We are gonna plan your wedding

05:53.729 --> 05:56.438
and it's gonna be amazing.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.315
- You sure?

05:58.359 --> 05:59.232
- I'm positive.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.276
- Thank you.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.194
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.321
- We should get back.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.113
It's getting late.

06:05.157 --> 06:05.947
Got a long way.

06:05.991 --> 06:06.823
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.035
See, it's more fun already.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.454
Thank you, Jordy.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.332
It's so gorgeous out here.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.880
- So, Amy,
what do you think?

06:21.924 --> 06:22.839
How's it going?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.716
- Oh, great.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.094
Carrie, thanks so much for
agreeing to do this with me.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.638
Plus, this is way better
than my old office.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.723
- It's just as much
of a win for me.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.600
I don't have another
fitting until00,

06:33.644 --> 06:34.976
so I'll come back and
help you in a bit.

06:35.020 --> 06:35.852
- Thank you.

06:35.896 --> 06:36.728
- Of course.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.532
Restraining order.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.119
Thomas Mannit seeking
protection from Amy McGraw.

06:53.539 --> 06:57.207
She has displayed deep
psychotic delusional behavior

06:57.251 --> 07:00.335
and may be violent
and dangerous.

07:01.755 --> 07:02.796
- Hey, Amy.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.964
- Yeah

07:04.007 --> 07:05.132
- I forgot to tell you

07:05.175 --> 07:07.717
I'm doing a store
wide 20% off discount

07:07.761 --> 07:08.844
for all new customers.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.345
Can I include your services?

07:10.389 --> 07:11.721
- Wow, really?

07:11.765 --> 07:12.639
That's a lot.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.391
Even on the pre-owned dresses?

07:14.435 --> 07:15.684
- Everything.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.561
I really think we can
get this venture going.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.311
What do you think?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.187
You in on the discount?

07:19.231 --> 07:20.730
- Yeah, I agree.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.982
Let's build this business.

07:23.110 --> 07:23.942
- Be right back.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.075
Carrie's Bridal.

07:32.119 --> 07:32.784
This is Carrie.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.827
How can I help you?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.873
- Thomas Mannit.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.919
Blocked.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.046
You can't hide from me.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.423
- Okay, great.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.633
I've got you down for
Saturday the 21st at30.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.677
Mm-hmm, see you then.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.679
Welcome!

07:52.723 --> 07:54.264
It's great to see
you again, Macy.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.390
- You too, Carrie.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.391
- Hi, Jordy.

07:56.435 --> 07:57.601
- Hi, Carrie.

07:57.644 --> 07:58.643
- Okay, let's get started.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.020
I'm on a bit of a schedule,

08:00.063 --> 08:03.482
but I did pull a few ideas
from a couple magazines.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.316
- Fantastic.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.650
Let's take a look at these.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.239
- So, what do you think?

08:12.743 --> 08:14.117
- Champagne?

08:14.161 --> 08:14.868
- Oh, yes.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.620
That is very helpful.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.246
Thank you.
- Thank you.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.164
- This is Amy.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.249
She's our wedding coordinator.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.043
- Hi, have you hired one yet?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.961
- Oh no, I don't need one.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.796
We're just doing a small
wedding at my father-in-law's,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.840
so nothing fancy.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.217
- Even with a small wedding,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.719
there are so many benefits
to having a coordinator.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.846
Discount on flowers and cake,

08:34.890 --> 08:36.097
someone to take care of things

08:36.141 --> 08:38.892
so you don't have to
stress on your big day.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.644
Now, if you want to
take a look at that,

08:40.687 --> 08:42.562
let me know if there are any
changes you want to make.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.855
There is a section in there

08:43.899 --> 08:45.690
that is wedding
planner oriented.

08:45.734 --> 08:46.858
So if you can fill that out,

08:46.902 --> 08:48.485
I'll have Amy take a look.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.694
No pressure, Macy,

08:49.738 --> 08:51.196
but I think it might
be a really good idea.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.324
- That is exactly
what I told her.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.492
How much does it cost?

08:55.536 --> 08:57.118
- Here, let me look
at the information.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.119
Macy, right?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.120
- Yeah.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.330
- Oh, yeah.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.415
I think I can simplify
some things for you.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.750
- Oh, are you sure?

09:03.794 --> 09:05.043
I mean, it's probably too late

09:05.087 --> 09:07.295
and too low of a budget
to even interest you.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.964
- You let me worry about that.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.590
I'm pretty good at
making problems go away,

09:10.634 --> 09:12.342
so I think I can
do that for you.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.470
- Okay, I guess it doesn't
hurt to take a look.

09:15.514 --> 09:16.763
- Oh, perfect.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.557
Well how about you
enjoy your day.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.518
Relax, drink some champagne,
try on some dresses.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.061
I'll look over the information
and get back to you.

09:23.105 --> 09:23.770
Deal?

09:23.814 --> 09:25.188
- Sounds like a plan.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.484
- I'm kind of thinking
white would be better.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.610
I do like white.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.028
Yeah, very classic.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.864
- Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.661
Look at you all grown up.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.496
- I think that one eye
is bigger than the other.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.956
- They look the same to me.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.207
- You're lucky I love you, Jeff.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.626
Some girls might not like
such an imperfect boy.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.836
- What about my ears?

09:47.879 --> 09:49.087
Is one bigger?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.096
- Much better.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.657
Restraining order.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.909
I'll show you violent
and dangerous.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.632
Carrie, I need to run a few
errands before it gets too late.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.091
I'll see you in the morning.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.469
- Okay, lock the
front door on your way out.

10:37.554 --> 10:42.474
See you tomorrow.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.783
- 1-2-3 Alarm,
is this Miss Amy McGraw?

10:59.826 --> 11:00.659
- Yes, it is.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.160
Will you shut off my alarm?

11:02.204 --> 11:05.163
I forgot to put in my
passcode and it won't go off.

11:05.207 --> 11:06.373
- Yes, ma'am.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.624
Would you like us to
send the security car

11:07.668 --> 11:08.750
out to your address?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.126
- No, I'm fine.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.378
That won't be necessary.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.045
- Okay, ma'am.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.672
Have a nice evening.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.125
- What the hell?

11:50.168 --> 11:52.210
Did you forget I have a
restraining order against you?

11:53.922 --> 11:56.381
- We have unfinished business.

11:56.425 --> 11:58.425
- So, you want to have some fun?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.885
I can forget about the
restraining order if you can.

12:00.929 --> 12:02.637
- We slept together.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.098
How could you take out
a restraining order?

12:05.142 --> 12:06.099
- Amy, you have to admit,

12:06.143 --> 12:07.600
things got a little out of hand.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.894
You got pretty nuts for awhile.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.187
- We were in love.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.733
You hurt me.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.317
- We hooked up at a bar.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.861
We were drunk.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.489
- We didn't just hook up at
a bar because we were drunk.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.366
- That's what I did.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.492
We were definitely drunk.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.910
- What about all
those late night texts

12:25.996 --> 12:27.954
asking me to come over?

12:27.998 --> 12:29.581
- They're booty calls, Amy.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.249
Nobody forced you to come over.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.001
You got what you wanted.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.586
- No, I didn't
get what I wanted.

12:34.629 --> 12:36.671
You said you loved me.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.839
- Come on.

12:37.883 --> 12:38.798
We're grownups.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.175
I was being nice.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.427
I didn't want you to feel
like a tramp or something.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.304
- God, you're a ....

12:44.431 --> 12:46.139
- Look, if you're not
here for some fun,

12:46.183 --> 12:47.515
then this is the same
old conversation.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.058
We've already been through this.

12:50.604 --> 12:52.812
- I guess we have.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.815
- Seriously, Amy, just get out.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.027
Leave before I call the
police and have you arrested.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.362
- The police will
be here soon enough.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.697
- What?

13:02.741 --> 13:05.283
Man, you are a crazy chick.

13:05.327 --> 13:08.620
- You have always
underestimated me, Thomas.

13:08.663 --> 13:12.707
So now, you're gonna find
out just how crazy I am.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.751
- They're gonna lock
you up for a long time.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.377
- Oh, don't worry.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.713
You won't be seeing me anymore.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.089
- Good.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.217
I'd advise you to leave
before they answer.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.426
- All right, all
right, I'm leaving.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.598
But just one more thing.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.350
- Amy, no.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.435
This isn't gonna solve anything.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.394
Amy, please.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.147
- It's better to
have loved and lost

13:36.191 --> 13:38.983
than to never have loved at all.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.444
Who said that, Thomas?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.987
Not you, that's for sure.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.448
I think it was Tennyson.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.616
Am I right?

14:00.549 --> 14:02.507
Where's your damn
restraining order now?

14:13.937 --> 14:15.478
- Gosh, I've
got a million things to do.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.689
Finalize the dress
choices, get it altered,

14:17.732 --> 14:19.232
pick out the shoes and veil,

14:19.276 --> 14:20.733
keep on Jeff about his tux,

14:20.777 --> 14:22.694
do a site map and ceremony,

14:22.737 --> 14:25.238
book the caterer, lock
in the guest count,

14:25.282 --> 14:27.574
finalize the menu,

14:27.617 --> 14:28.658
oh, lock the car.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.162
Me, yes, yes, yes.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.373
Call the DJ, get
him a list of music,

14:35.417 --> 14:37.458
A song for our first dance.

14:37.502 --> 14:41.588
Oh God, how am I'm ever
gonna get this done in time.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.339
- In order for a
company to effectively

14:43.383 --> 14:45.425
and efficiently
carry out operations,

14:45.468 --> 14:48.219
they have to account
for contingencies.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.099
Oh, sorry guys.

14:53.143 --> 14:53.933
I ran over again.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.435
Don't forget,

14:55.478 --> 14:57.687
your papers on capital budgeting
are due Monday by00 p.m.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.857
That's Pacific time, not
Hawaii standard time, Steve.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.030
- Hey, babe.

15:07.115 --> 15:07.822
Good job.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.948
- Thank you.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.241
- Hey, can you do
me a huge favor?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.076
Can you give the deposit
to the caterers for me?

15:12.120 --> 15:14.162
I'm gonna run a meet Jordy
and show her a dress.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.164
Oh, and I might have dinner
with her if that's okay.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.832
- Sounds good.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.667
Oh, by the way, I called Wyatt

15:19.711 --> 15:21.002
and left him a
message about the tux

15:21.046 --> 15:23.046
and I'll probably just
have dinner with my dad,

15:23.089 --> 15:23.713
so don't worry about me.

15:23.757 --> 15:24.505
- Okay, sounds good.

15:24.549 --> 15:25.590
Love you.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.175
- Love you more.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.426
- Say hi to your dad.
- All right.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.772
- Well, Jeff, looks
like I'm single again.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.236
Can't wait to spend some
quality time together.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.740
It's been such a long time.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.995
- Well, I don't know.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.749
It was nice, but maybe
I can get better.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.335
- Well, we need to practice
if we're gonna get married.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.387
- It really does look
gorgeous on you, Mace.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.555
- It's only 150 over your price.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.723
Last one I have.

16:15.767 --> 16:16.641
It's discontinued.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.687
- I don't know.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.146
Can I think about
it and come back?

16:22.190 --> 16:24.148
- I understand.
It's a big decision.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.525
I'll hold it for you.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.275
- Thanks.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.448
- Wyatt is in charge
of the planning.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.866
- Wyatt, huh?

16:33.910 --> 16:36.077
Man, Jeff.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.997
Wyatt's never had
the best judgment,

16:39.040 --> 16:41.124
so don't let him take
you to a strip club

16:41.167 --> 16:43.459
the week before
your wedding here.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.628
- I know, but Wyatt's
been my best friend

16:45.672 --> 16:46.629
since we were kids.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.755
- I know.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.674
Look, I have known
plenty of guys

16:49.718 --> 16:51.676
that have screwed
up their marriage

16:51.720 --> 16:53.678
the week before their wedding.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.304
- I'm gonna talk to Macy.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.306
She knows Wyatt can be trouble.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.391
She trusts me.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.308
- Oh my gosh.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.270
I am so hungry.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.605
- Can I refresh your champagne?

17:04.649 --> 17:05.690
- Oh yes please.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.442
- Champagne?
- Yes, please.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.484
- Thank you.

17:08.945 --> 17:09.986
- Up, up.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.113
Oh yes, perfect.

17:12.157 --> 17:12.613
- There you go.

17:12.657 --> 17:13.281
- Thank you.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.825
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.957
Is Jeff having a bachelor party?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.042
- You know, I don't know.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.084
We haven't even talked about it.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.127
- Huh.

17:26.171 --> 17:26.836
Well, I know Wyatt.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.254
He's gonna push for one.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.590
- I think maybe, but he
hasn't said anything to me.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.260
- So do you want a
bachelorette party?

17:34.304 --> 17:35.261
- No.

17:35.346 --> 17:36.262
You know that's not me.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.849
- Okay, but what if
Jeff did want one?

17:39.893 --> 17:40.683
Then what?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.894
Then wouldn't you want one?

17:42.937 --> 17:44.854
- I think you want the
bachelorette party.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.566
- Okay, I'm in a dry spell,

17:48.610 --> 17:49.901
if you know what I mean.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.777
- That's a good good idea.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.111
But look, this is your choice.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.280
This is your wedding, right?

17:54.699 --> 17:55.782
Your party.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.576
If you don't want to
go to a strip club

17:58.620 --> 17:59.577
or do whatever else
he had in mind,

17:59.621 --> 18:02.330
you just say, no.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.915
That'll be the end of it.

18:03.958 --> 18:04.957
- I got this.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.459
Dad, I got this.

18:08.379 --> 18:09.212
- All right.

18:10.632 --> 18:11.130
Making sure.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.674
I trust you.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.387
- So having handsome
hunky men dancing around

18:18.431 --> 18:20.515
is a terrible thing?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.433
- I'm just saying
I wouldn't hate it.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.228
- Look, you know
that's not me, okay?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.562
When you get married,

18:26.606 --> 18:29.065
I will throw you the most
epic bachelorette party.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.776
I don't want that, okay?

18:31.820 --> 18:34.195
I'm in love with Jeff.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.404
I don't need it.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.698
And having handsome
hunky men dancing around

18:37.742 --> 18:39.117
would just be a waste on me.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.452
- Ohhh, I get it.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.664
I'm jealous, but I get it.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.917
So just a girls' weekend then?

18:47.961 --> 18:48.751
- Yes, that would be great.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.295
Look, maybe just me and you,

18:51.339 --> 18:52.797
a relaxing weekend,

18:52.841 --> 18:55.550
and put all the wedding
planning behind us.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.384
- You've got it.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.301
I will plan everything.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.302
You relax.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.429
- You know what?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.472
Cheers to that.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.306
- Cheers.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.954
- Babe, I'm home.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.414
- Hey, beautiful.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.957
Get over here.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.292
Finally.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.668
- Aw, I love you.

19:30.712 --> 19:31.669
I missed you.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.680
- Carrie, you here?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.056
- Yep, in the showroom.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.019
- Morning.
- Good morning.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.187
- I brought coffee.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.855
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.568
So I was kicking around
some ideas last night

19:55.612 --> 19:57.069
about how to grow the business.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.237
- Oh?

19:58.281 --> 19:59.822
- Well, we need
current wedding photos.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.115
I mean, a wedding
that we have done,

20:01.159 --> 20:03.576
not just stock photos
of other people's work.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.785
- That sounds good,

20:04.829 --> 20:06.329
but where are we gonna
get current photos?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.496
We haven't planned
a wedding yet.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.415
- Well, I was thinking

20:09.459 --> 20:11.042
what if we give Macy and Jeff

20:11.085 --> 20:13.544
a free wedding planning package?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.087
- Wow, free?

20:15.173 --> 20:15.963
- Totally free.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.465
I mean, besides,

20:17.508 --> 20:20.301
I'm coming in last minute
and the wedding is very soon.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.928
I know that I can
save them some money

20:21.971 --> 20:24.305
and then we can get what
we need for the website.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.182
- Okay.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.642
Well, let me talk to Macy

20:27.685 --> 20:29.101
and I'll let you
know what she says.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.978
- Oh, well maybe I
should talk to her.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.438
- No, I should do it.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.190
She's been coming here
for almost a year,

20:34.234 --> 20:36.651
so it's best if I do it.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.818
- Okay.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.904
Well, let me know if
you need any help.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.656
- It should be fine.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.033
Free is a good price,
so I think she'll do it.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.791
- Call Macy.

20:51.834 --> 20:52.917
Calling Macy.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.591
- Hello?
- Is this Macy?

21:00.635 --> 21:01.968
- Yes, who is this?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.552
- This is Amy from
the bridal shop.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.553
The wedding coordinator.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.389
I met you yesterday.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.932
- Yes, hey, I remember you.

21:07.976 --> 21:10.351
- Well, I have
good news for you.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.269
You won the drawing.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.771
- What drawing?

21:13.815 --> 21:15.523
- Oh, didn't Carrie tell you?

21:15.566 --> 21:18.651
Everyone who tries on a dress
is automatically entered.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.695
The cutoff was closing
time yesterday.

21:20.738 --> 21:24.699
You won a free silver level
wedding planning package.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.200
- Are you serious?

21:26.244 --> 21:27.660
- Serious.

21:27.704 --> 21:32.331
It's valued at $2,000 and
includes a day of coordination.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.041
- That's amazing.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.501
- Wonderful.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.420
I'd love to go over the
details with you and Jeff.

21:37.463 --> 21:40.089
How's tomorrow,
say around00?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.215
- Yeah, that sounds great.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.008
See you then.

21:42.051 --> 21:42.800
- Bye.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.307
Nice place, Jeff.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.309
You've done well for yourself.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.480
You have a teaching assistant?

21:57.442 --> 21:58.482
She's cute.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.110
We'll need to replace her.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.325
Advanced business marketing.

22:07.368 --> 22:10.119
Sounds like a class
I should take.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.079
Maybe you could teach
me a few things.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.373
That'd be nice.

22:18.921 --> 22:19.837
- All right,
are you excited?

22:19.881 --> 22:21.005
- Yes.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.757
Oh my God, I can't
believe we won.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.924
- I know.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.468
Finally give you the
wedding you deserve.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.388
- Okay, let's see
what she's got to say.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.391
- Hi, Macy.
- Hi.

22:32.435 --> 22:33.851
- I didn't expect
to see you today.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.312
Are you here for the dress
you tried on the other day?

22:36.356 --> 22:38.189
- Oh, no.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.441
I'm still thinking
about that one.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.233
- Well, not a problem.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.443
What can I help you with?

22:42.487 --> 22:43.736
- I'm here to see Amy.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.279
She told me that I won the prize

22:45.323 --> 22:47.114
for the free wedding planning.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.617
I mean, we won the prize.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.618
- Yes, I won it too.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.704
- So, she told you
about the prize.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.581
- Yes, and we're so
excited, aren't we?

22:57.794 --> 22:58.959
Oh no, is something wrong?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.795
Was this a misunderstanding
or something?

23:00.838 --> 23:02.421
- No, no, no, no.

23:02.465 --> 23:03.130
You know what?

23:03.174 --> 23:04.131
Let me go and get her.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.591
- Hi, you two.

23:05.635 --> 23:08.260
I'm so happy to be working
together on your wedding.

23:08.346 --> 23:09.387
Hi, Macy.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.304
I'm Amy.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.390
Can't wait to get started.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.682
- Nice to meet you.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.351
- Do I know you from somewhere?

23:16.312 --> 23:18.020
- Oh, I'm not sure.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.439
I don't think so, but maybe?

23:21.651 --> 23:23.734
- Well, you know, I
hate to interrupt,

23:23.778 --> 23:25.361
but we are on a
bit of a schedule.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.113
We have a wedding
in just a few days

23:27.156 --> 23:29.365
and just wanted to see
what this was all about.

23:29.409 --> 23:30.616
- Of course, Mace.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.326
- Of course, me too.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.160
Follow me.

23:33.204 --> 23:33.953
Lots to do.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.709
- So you're having
a small friends

23:40.753 --> 23:42.795
and family event at
your father's home?

23:42.839 --> 23:44.755
- Yes, at Jeff's father's place.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.799
- First thing,
anything you've booked,

23:46.843 --> 23:49.802
I can get you my discount on
flowers, cakes, et cetera.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.847
20% off anything you
buy in this store.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.765
Everything is going
to be cheaper.

23:54.809 --> 23:57.977
- Oh my god, that
sounds amazing.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.395
Shall we do it?
- Yeah.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.146
- Okay.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.857
Oh, good.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.566
Are you excited?

24:03.609 --> 24:04.775
- So excited.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.320
Can we sit anywhere?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.780
- Yes,
wherever you like.

24:09.824 --> 24:11.198
A server will be right with you.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.743
- Miss Amy Dardenswick.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.497
I like the sound of that.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.464
- I just can't.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.174
How do people get
married in this?

24:28.217 --> 24:29.049
- I don't know.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.093
How do people get
married in this?

24:31.137 --> 24:32.595
- It's too big for you.

24:33.598 --> 24:34.930
- Oh, hey.

24:34.974 --> 24:35.723
- You okay?

24:35.766 --> 24:36.932
- Yeah, I'm fine.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.142
What's up?

24:38.186 --> 24:41.228
- I wanted to talk to
you about Macy and Jeff.

24:41.355 --> 24:42.646
- Certainly.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.273
Do you need my help
with something?

24:44.317 --> 24:47.526
- Well, it's just that we
agreed I would talk to Macy

24:47.570 --> 24:49.069
about the free wedding
planning services,

24:49.113 --> 24:52.072
but then you created
this big story

24:52.116 --> 24:53.115
about winning a contest

24:53.159 --> 24:53.991
and that's not what happened.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.618
- I know.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.995
I was already talking to them
and it just kind of came out.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.705
I thought of the contest
on the spot though.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.665
That was a better way to
do it, don't you think?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.793
- Even so, we agreed
I would talk to them.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.379
I can't have you doing
things that I don't agree to.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.590
It's my shop and
my responsibility,

25:09.634 --> 25:11.425
so don't do that again.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.760
- Sure.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.930
I didn't mean to
overstep my bounds.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.848
God, I didn't think
everything was so strict.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.892
- Amy, don't be like that.

25:19.936 --> 25:21.477
If this is gonna
work between us,

25:21.521 --> 25:23.562
I just need you to
do what's agreed.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.272
There's no other way
that this is gonna work,

25:25.316 --> 25:28.359
so otherwise, we're
gonna need to part ways.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.818
- No, I'll do what
you ask, Carrie.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.903
I'm sorry.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.404
Okay?

25:32.448 --> 25:33.280
I apologize.

25:35.826 --> 25:36.700
We good?

25:36.744 --> 25:38.202
- Yeah, we're good.

25:38.246 --> 25:39.703
Thanks.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.247
This is supposed to be fun, Amy.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.623
Let's make it fun.

25:42.667 --> 25:43.541
- I agree.

25:43.584 --> 25:44.500
Let's make it fun.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.710
- Okay, great.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.254
Thank you.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.922
I'm gonna order something
from across the street.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.382
Do you want anything?

25:52.552 --> 25:54.969
- A Greek salad and
order whatever you want.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.971
I'll pick it up and pay.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.556
- All right, you're on.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.140
Thank you.

26:02.103 --> 26:03.477
- You know, I feel really good

26:03.521 --> 26:05.312
about everything we
accomplished with Amy.

26:05.356 --> 26:07.648
I'm actually kind of excited
about all the wedding planning.

26:07.692 --> 26:08.899
- Wow, I'm really glad.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.317
What did I tell you?

26:10.361 --> 26:11.610
- I know, you're right,

26:11.654 --> 26:14.029
everything always works out.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.031
I was just, I don't know,

26:16.117 --> 26:17.825
kind of sad to plan
it all by myself,

26:17.868 --> 26:18.993
especially since my
mom couldn't be there.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.327
You know?

26:20.371 --> 26:23.289
But, now that we have
a free wedding planner,

26:23.332 --> 26:25.874
I don't have to
worry about anything.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.043
- I'm here to pick up
an order for Carrie.

26:28.087 --> 26:28.836
- Yes,
it's right here.

26:28.879 --> 26:30.087
25.70 please.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.756
- Keep the change.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.466
- Thank you.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.011
- I love that.

26:37.054 --> 26:37.845
- You know what?

26:37.888 --> 26:38.596
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.513
I'll be right back.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.347
- That's funny.

26:40.391 --> 26:41.640
- What?

26:41.684 --> 26:43.601
- Powder my nose, does
anybody still say that?

26:43.686 --> 26:45.311
- Well, I just did.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.563
And it's better than
the alternative.

26:47.607 --> 26:48.814
- Well, that's fair.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.357
All right.

26:50.401 --> 26:53.152
Well, I'm gonna stay here and
I'll powder my nose later.

26:53.195 --> 26:53.819
- You're gross.

26:55.072 --> 26:55.988
- You love me.

27:03.998 --> 27:05.581
- We meet again.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.124
- Oh, I suppose you would
eat here all the time

27:07.168 --> 27:08.667
with your office just
being down the street.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.544
- Oh yeah, food here's terrific.

27:12.423 --> 27:13.839
Well, enjoy.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.007
I gotta go.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.091
- I'll
see you tonight.

27:16.886 --> 27:17.635
- What?

27:17.678 --> 27:19.136
- Have a good night.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.929
- Oh yeah, you too.

27:26.812 --> 27:27.853
- Mace, what do you think?

27:27.897 --> 27:28.854
Seated or buffet?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.190
Buffet's best, yeah?

27:31.233 --> 27:33.484
That way, everyone can
just grab what they want.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.152
- Yeah, that's true.

27:35.196 --> 27:36.612
Hmm.

27:38.115 --> 27:38.989
- Oh.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
This was sitting for
you at the front door.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.751
What is it?

27:57.760 --> 28:00.636
- Join me next weekend at the
Somerset Winery for a sparkle

28:00.680 --> 28:02.346
and spa weekend of relaxation

28:02.390 --> 28:04.306
and an epic bachelorette party.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.724
Love, Jordy.

28:05.768 --> 28:06.642
Oh, how sweet.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.186
- That's a five
star bachelorette.

28:14.402 --> 28:16.318
So Wyatt wants to
throw me a
bachelor party.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.238
- And I'm assuming at
a strip club, right?

28:19.281 --> 28:20.781
- I told him nothing sleazy.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.324
It had to be PG.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.243
- There's nothing
PG about Wyatt.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.370
And since when did he ever
take advice from anyone,

28:26.414 --> 28:29.206
especially about his
terrible taste in women?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.709
- Look, if it makes
you uncomfortable,
I will tell him no.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.628
- It's your decision.

28:34.672 --> 28:35.921
Do what you want to do, okay?

28:35.965 --> 28:37.589
- I'm gonna go meet
Jordy for some drinks

28:37.633 --> 28:38.507
and I'll see you later.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.383
- All right.

29:01.907 --> 29:02.781
- You okay?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.492
Amy?

29:05.536 --> 29:06.577
Everything all right?

29:07.455 --> 29:08.245
Amy?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.789
- Carrie, I'm heading out.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.249
Lock up when you leave.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.336
- Okay,
see you tomorrow.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.016
- Do you remember when we were
here for our 21st birthdays?

29:29.059 --> 29:30.851
I've always loved this place.

29:30.895 --> 29:32.144
Oh, and thank you, by the way,

29:32.188 --> 29:35.314
for the champagne and the
Somerset Winery weekend.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.690
I'm so excited.

29:36.734 --> 29:39.234
- I know, I just wanted
you to relax and have fun.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.404
- Thank you.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.280
Love you.

29:43.324 --> 29:44.198
- I love you.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.574
And you're welcome, by the way.

29:45.618 --> 29:48.243
I mean, what the heck are
best friends for, right?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.661
- You're gonna make me cry.

29:49.705 --> 29:50.537
- No.

29:50.581 --> 29:51.955
Save the crying for the wedding.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.291
Uh-oh.

29:54.335 --> 29:55.334
I know that face.

29:55.377 --> 29:56.418
What's going on?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.380
- Jeff told me that he wanted
to have a bachelor party.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.049
- Oh gosh.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.175
What'd you say?

30:03.219 --> 30:05.010
- I said he can do
what he wants to do

30:05.054 --> 30:07.888
and I was going to come
meet you for drinks.

30:07.932 --> 30:09.139
- Okay, that's good.

30:09.183 --> 30:12.434
And I like being right
every once in a while.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.644
- Yes, you are right.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.563
Wyatt is the one
that's pushing for it.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.525
- Does this mean we are
having a bachelorette party?

30:19.568 --> 30:22.319
- No, nice try.

30:22.363 --> 30:23.904
- A girl can try, right?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.283
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to make jokes.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.285
I know this really bugs you.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.247
- Yeah, it's just.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.456
I mean, when Jeff told me,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.083
it just really hit me, you know?

30:37.878 --> 30:40.087
I don't want him to
have a bachelor party.

30:40.130 --> 30:43.841
I mean, is that bad for me
not wanting him to have one?

30:43.884 --> 30:45.342
- No.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.511
If you don't want him to have
one, you should tell him.

30:47.555 --> 30:48.554
- Yeah, you're right.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.681
I'll think about it.

30:52.142 --> 30:56.770
- So, you just won that big
wedding planning package.

30:56.814 --> 30:58.313
- Oh, yeah.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.983
Amy is going to make
my life so much easier.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.401
And now, I can just relax

31:02.444 --> 31:05.195
and actually enjoy
the whole process.

31:05.239 --> 31:06.905
- Do you like working with her?

31:07.992 --> 31:08.824
- I like her.

31:10.494 --> 31:11.827
Why?

31:11.871 --> 31:13.495
What's wrong?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.205
- No, I just,

31:15.249 --> 31:16.623
I can't put my finger on it,

31:16.667 --> 31:19.960
but there's something
strange about her.

31:20.004 --> 31:21.378
- Really?

31:21.422 --> 31:24.423
- Yeah, I don't know.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.215
There's something.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.717
I don't know what it is.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.510
- Look, whatever it is,

31:28.554 --> 31:33.223
Amy is doing me a huge favor
and you too, by the way.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.559
So even if she's
a little strange,

31:35.603 --> 31:38.437
let's just put it all behind us.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.563
- Gosh, you're right.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.815
That's what I keep
trying to get you to do.

31:41.859 --> 31:42.941
Cheers.

31:42.985 --> 31:44.067
- Cheers.

32:03.005 --> 32:03.795
- Amy?

32:06.800 --> 32:07.591
Hello?

32:09.178 --> 32:10.344
Amy, are you still here?

32:59.603 --> 33:00.560
What?

33:00.604 --> 33:03.230
A restraining order for Amy?

33:03.273 --> 33:06.650
Deep psychotic
delusional behavior

33:06.694 --> 33:10.737
and may be violent
and dangerous.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.435
- This is nice.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.482
Oh, let me fix this.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.988
There, much better.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.199
Touch of class is
always a good thing.

35:22.412 --> 35:23.954
So, Carrie,

35:23.997 --> 35:26.289
what do you have lined
up for me this morning?

35:27.501 --> 35:28.291
Oh, perfect.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.460
A client's coming in soon.

35:30.504 --> 35:31.962
I better get myself together.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.393
You must be Charlotte.

35:46.436 --> 35:48.353
Come on in.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.147
Let's help you find
the perfect dress.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.068
- So I was thinking the bar
and the refreshments over here.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.444
And then I was also thinking

35:56.488 --> 35:59.281
that we could put the food
over here by the kitchen.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.407
- Yeah, all right.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.783
That would make it
easier on a caterer.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.076
- Right, exactly.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.620
- Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.080
It's been a crazy morning.

36:07.124 --> 36:08.290
Carrie had to go out of town

36:08.333 --> 36:10.083
and I've been taking
care of her customers.

36:10.127 --> 36:10.959
- Oh, that's okay.

36:11.003 --> 36:11.835
Thank you so much for coming.

36:11.879 --> 36:13.837
Amy, this is Connor, Jeff's dad,

36:13.881 --> 36:15.964
and Connor, this is Amy,
the wedding planner.

36:16.008 --> 36:16.631
- Nice to meet you, Amy.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.175
- Nice to meet you.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.218
- Hey, how's it going, everyone?

36:20.262 --> 36:21.386
- Great.

36:21.430 --> 36:22.846
Hey, why don't I get
us all some drinks?

36:22.890 --> 36:24.347
- Oh, I'd love some coffee.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.682
- Oh, I'll make it.

36:25.726 --> 36:26.474
- I'll give you a hand.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.601
- Okay, cool.

36:28.729 --> 36:31.855
- So I actually grew
up in this house.

36:31.899 --> 36:33.857
Why don't I show you
around while they're busy?

36:33.901 --> 36:35.275
What do you want to see first?

36:35.319 --> 36:36.776
- Ooh.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.154
Well, let's start with where
everyone plans to get ready.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.363
- Sure, follow me.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.033
- Gladly.

36:50.918 --> 36:52.918
- So, this is my dad's room.

36:52.961 --> 36:56.254
I figure Jordy and Macy
could get ready at my place?

36:56.298 --> 36:57.672
- Sounds good.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.883
Do you mind If I take
pictures while we walk around?

36:59.927 --> 37:01.218
It'll help me remember.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.385
- Sure, of course.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.140
- Here, let's take a selfie.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.058
- Okay.

37:09.853 --> 37:10.602
- Smile, Jeff.

37:14.191 --> 37:14.940
Thanks.

37:14.983 --> 37:15.815
Perfect.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.152
It's always good to get
shots with the clients

37:19.196 --> 37:20.362
for the website.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.404
- Oh, of course.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.201
Oh, not that photo.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.621
Six year old me with a face
only a mother could love.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.289
- I wouldn't say that.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.791
You were a cutie.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.127
- I still don't know how
I found a woman like Macy.

37:38.048 --> 37:39.506
- Where will you and
Wyatt be getting ready?

37:39.549 --> 37:43.426
- Oh, so this is my bedroom.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.594
We have a guest room,

37:44.638 --> 37:46.012
but I think my aunt
is staying in there.

37:46.056 --> 37:48.723
She's coming down from
Little Rock for the wedding.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.267
- This will do just fine.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.980
This is so cute.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.900
Is there a bathroom
I could use up here?

37:58.944 --> 38:00.068
- Oh yeah.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.320
Right down here on
the right hand side.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.405
- Oh, sorry.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.155
- Excuse me, Jeff.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.073
- Sorry.

38:06.743 --> 38:07.867
I'll just be right downstairs.

38:07.911 --> 38:08.702
- Okay.

38:08.745 --> 38:09.536
- Okay, great.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.338
- As I see it, yes.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.144
- It's so uneven.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.822
- Yo, what is up, Jeff?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.324
You ready for this party?

39:29.368 --> 39:31.326
- Listen, nothing
too crazy, okay?

39:31.370 --> 39:32.118
- It's a bachelor party.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.870
It's supposed to be crazy.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.372
- No, I'm not screwing around.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.290
It's gotta be PG-13 at best.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.333
- Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

39:38.377 --> 39:40.126
PG-13, loud and clear.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.086
- You know what?

39:41.129 --> 39:41.795
Do whatever you want.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.213
I gotta get to class.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.422
- Do whatever I want?

39:44.466 --> 39:45.465
Those words are legally binding.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.133
See ya.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.718
- And that's why companies
need to determine

39:48.762 --> 39:52.180
the most cost effective
mix of debt and equity.

39:52.224 --> 39:54.391
Now, how do they do that?

39:59.981 --> 40:01.898
Right, so how do they do that?

40:01.942 --> 40:04.567
Equity capital is generated
through the sale of stock,

40:04.611 --> 40:07.278
so you're essentially giving
away a piece of your company.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.447
Oh, all right, guys.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.241
Go ahead and leave
your tests on your desk

40:11.284 --> 40:12.617
and I will see you all later.

40:16.873 --> 40:18.415
- Hey.

40:18.458 --> 40:19.624
I hope I didn't freak you out

40:19.668 --> 40:21.292
by just showing
up to your class?

40:21.336 --> 40:23.378
- Oh, no, no, did you enroll?

40:23.422 --> 40:25.171
- Well, after you mentioned
you were teaching this class,

40:25.215 --> 40:27.424
I looked it up and saw
that I could audit it.

40:27.467 --> 40:28.925
I'd love to expand my business,

40:28.969 --> 40:32.762
so I thought maybe I could
learn a thing or two from you.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.514
- Well, we're happy to have you.

40:34.558 --> 40:35.765
- Well, great.

40:35.809 --> 40:37.517
Do you think we could
grab a cup of coffee?

40:37.561 --> 40:40.061
I have a few questions
regarding my business plan.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.354
- You know what?

40:41.398 --> 40:42.897
I've actually got about
a half hour right now.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.815
- Perfect.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.949
Your executive
summary looks good.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.539
- Found a typo.

41:01.209 --> 41:04.210
- Your marketing summary
seems a little thin.

41:04.254 --> 41:06.671
- Yeah, I'm having a lot
of trouble with that.

41:06.715 --> 41:07.881
- Right.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.799
Basically, you just have to show

41:09.843 --> 41:13.219
that you understand what
the customer is looking for.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.137
- Makes sense.

41:15.849 --> 41:17.307
I know it's only one day,

41:17.350 --> 41:20.518
but your wedding day's the most
important day of your life.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.895
It's going to sound cheesy,

41:21.938 --> 41:25.315
but that's what I wanted
to get into this business.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.692
I'm not just in the
business of weddings.

41:27.736 --> 41:30.778
I'm in the business of
making dreams come true.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.071
- Well, that's what you're
doing for Macy and I,

41:32.115 --> 41:33.615
so thank you.

41:33.658 --> 41:34.824
- My pleasure.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.243
- There something so
familiar about you.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.829
Have we met before?

41:40.916 --> 41:42.207
- I didn't think
you would remember.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.334
I mean, I've changed so much.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.336
- Remember?

41:46.379 --> 41:47.670
What are you talking about?

41:57.057 --> 41:58.890
- Here, take a look at this.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.433
Maybe this will jog your memory.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.646
- It's a picture
from my dad's house.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.358
- I'm Amy from next door.

42:16.326 --> 42:17.659
- No, this can't.

42:20.205 --> 42:21.454
Amy?

42:21.498 --> 42:22.330
- That's right.

42:23.708 --> 42:24.874
That's me and you.

42:27.462 --> 42:29.921
- That's such a good picture
of us when we were kids.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.298
My mom loved that photo.

42:35.011 --> 42:36.803
I remember when the
accident happened.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.807
- Yeah, I was 13.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.016
It was terrible.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.434
- Amy, I'm so sorry.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.812
I mean, one day
you were just gone

42:45.855 --> 42:47.605
and I never got a
chance to say goodbye.

42:47.649 --> 42:50.775
- I know, I was heartbroken.

42:50.819 --> 42:52.860
We were best friends.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.487
- Yeah, we were.

42:54.531 --> 42:55.863
You were even my first kiss.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.199
- Mine too.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.577
You promised to marry me.

43:03.373 --> 43:04.622
- So what happened to you?

43:06.918 --> 43:09.419
- I was lucky enough to
survive the accident.

43:10.672 --> 43:13.256
I had so many surgeries
on my face and body.

43:14.884 --> 43:16.426
I had no one.

43:16.469 --> 43:17.802
I was completely alone.

43:20.557 --> 43:23.433
After that, they sent me
to live in foster care.

43:24.352 --> 43:26.102
- Oh my God, Amy, I'm so sorry.

43:26.146 --> 43:28.855
I didn't know, I didn't know.

43:28.898 --> 43:30.690
- Oh, sorry.

43:31.860 --> 43:33.359
- No, Dylan, it's fine.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.612
Old childhood
friend of mine, Amy.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.447
- Very nice to meet you, Amy.

43:38.366 --> 43:39.866
Jeff, I just,

43:39.909 --> 43:44.162
I just wanted to see if you
had time to review the tests.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.582
I have them all graded and ready
to go back to the students.

43:47.626 --> 43:49.000
- Yeah, sorry.

43:49.044 --> 43:50.293
I know we're on a
deadline for that.

43:50.337 --> 43:51.586
Amy, I'm so sorry.
I've got to deal with this.

43:51.630 --> 43:52.962
- Oh, no problem.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.672
I didn't mean to barge in
and monopolize your day.

43:54.716 --> 43:55.882
- Oh no, not at all.

43:55.925 --> 43:58.843
Actually, it was really
good to reconnect.

43:58.887 --> 44:00.928
I'm really glad you're
planning my wedding.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.473
What a lucky coincidence.

44:03.516 --> 44:04.766
- Yeah, it is lucky.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.184
And I'm happy to help.

44:06.227 --> 44:07.685
Well, duty calls.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.438
And I will text you and Macy
about the wedding arrangements.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.155
- Ooh, these dresses
are gorgeous.

44:22.369 --> 44:24.369
Ooh, I'm gonna have to
show Jordy this one.

44:26.247 --> 44:29.499
Oh yeah, so Amy's
taking your class?

44:29.542 --> 44:31.626
- Yeah, more auditing, but yeah.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.420
- I wonder why
she didn't tell me

44:34.464 --> 44:36.631
when we were at your
dad's other day.

44:36.675 --> 44:37.965
- I got the impression

44:38.009 --> 44:39.926
it was more of a spur of
the moment kind of thing.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.469
She asked me to take a
look at our business plan

44:41.513 --> 44:43.221
and something tells me

44:43.264 --> 44:45.431
that's not the only
reason she came by.

44:45.475 --> 44:46.849
- What do you think it is?

44:46.893 --> 44:48.267
- So when I was a kid,

44:48.311 --> 44:50.395
I had a neighborhood friend

44:50.438 --> 44:53.106
whose parents were
killed in a car accident.

44:53.149 --> 44:54.857
She moved away to live
with foster parents

44:54.901 --> 44:56.609
and I never saw her again.

44:56.653 --> 44:58.027
- Wait, Amy?

44:58.071 --> 44:59.904
- Yeah, Amy.

44:59.948 --> 45:02.365
- Oh my God, that's terrible.

45:03.576 --> 45:06.661
How old was she when
the accident happened?

45:07.789 --> 45:09.539
- I guess we were
about 13 years old.

45:10.750 --> 45:11.708
I mean, I definitely
didn't recognize her,

45:11.751 --> 45:13.751
it had been so long.

45:13.795 --> 45:16.879
And she had reconstructive
surgery after the accident.

45:16.923 --> 45:19.841
- Wow, that's awful.

45:21.678 --> 45:24.053
- What do you think
about all this?

45:24.097 --> 45:27.682
- Well, I think it's
kind of strange.

45:27.726 --> 45:28.599
- Yeah.

45:28.643 --> 45:29.892
I mean, it was a lifetime ago.

45:29.936 --> 45:32.895
- Yeah, but what do you
want to do about it?

45:32.939 --> 45:34.147
- Whatever makes you happy.

45:35.775 --> 45:38.192
- Well, she is making me happy.

45:38.236 --> 45:39.318
She is helping us out.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.821
I don't see what's so bad

45:41.865 --> 45:43.322
in you helping her
with the business plan

45:43.366 --> 45:45.658
and then she's helping
us plan our wedding.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.077
I mean, it's not like
she's an ex-girlfriend

45:48.121 --> 45:49.454
or an ex-wife, right?

45:50.915 --> 45:52.999
- I'm pretty sure we didn't
get too serious at age 13.

45:53.042 --> 45:53.916
- Let's hope not.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.924
Oh wait, what do you
think about that one?

46:08.266 --> 46:09.640
- This is Amy.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.517
- Amy, it's Connor.

46:11.561 --> 46:13.102
Look, I just want to know
if you received the photos

46:13.146 --> 46:15.480
I sent you of Jeff and Macy.

46:15.523 --> 46:18.649
- I did and these are
exactly what I need.

46:18.693 --> 46:19.859
- Great.

46:19.903 --> 46:21.360
Well, look, if you
need more, let me know.

46:21.404 --> 46:22.612
- Absolutely.

46:22.655 --> 46:23.446
- All right.

46:23.490 --> 46:24.280
Have a good night.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.882
- Let's see what this
suspicious package is.

46:47.722 --> 46:48.888
Mike, I got a body.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.141
- Code 1144X.

46:54.270 --> 46:55.770
- Holy crap, I got a pulse.

46:55.814 --> 46:56.896
Mike, she's alive.

46:56.940 --> 46:57.688
Check that, check that.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.274
Ma'am, ma'am, you're okay?

47:00.318 --> 47:01.359
Help is on the way, ma'am.

47:01.402 --> 47:03.402
Mike, let's get
that emergency kit,

47:03.446 --> 47:04.487
you know, the one with
the thermal blanket.

47:04.531 --> 47:05.446
And let's get a bottle of water.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.490
Ma'am, focus on me.

47:07.534 --> 47:08.658
You're safe.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.785
The ambulance is on the way.

47:10.829 --> 47:13.246
Detective, this is the phone
we found with the body.

47:15.458 --> 47:18.751
Unfortunately, it's locked
and there was no ID.

47:18.795 --> 47:21.003
- You may have saved
a life last night.

47:21.047 --> 47:22.046
Great job.

47:22.090 --> 47:23.589
- Thank you, sir.

47:23.633 --> 47:24.715
- Thanks for the phone.

47:29.430 --> 47:31.597
- Nurse, I want you
to monitor her vitals

47:31.641 --> 47:33.307
and notify me when she wakes up.

47:36.896 --> 47:38.312
Doc, when can I go see her?

47:38.356 --> 47:39.689
- She's in a coma.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.107
Really lucky to be alive.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.234
She has some bruising
around her neck.

47:43.278 --> 47:45.403
For right now, we've
done all we can.

47:45.446 --> 47:46.195
She will wake up.

47:46.239 --> 47:48.698
She's been through a lot.

47:48.741 --> 47:49.866
- Doc, one more thing.

47:49.909 --> 47:50.741
- Sure, what's up?

47:50.785 --> 47:52.159
- I need to unlock this phone.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.619
I need to find out
who this woman is

47:53.663 --> 47:54.996
or maybe a family contact.

47:56.249 --> 47:57.540
Do you think you could go in

47:57.584 --> 47:59.166
and put her thumb on this phone

47:59.210 --> 48:01.419
and maybe it'll unlock it?

48:01.462 --> 48:02.628
- Okay, sure.

48:02.672 --> 48:03.796
I can do that.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.505
- Thanks.

48:04.549 --> 48:05.464
- I'll be right back.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.760
- Hey, Amy.

48:09.804 --> 48:12.388
Sorry, I hope it's
not too early to call.

48:12.432 --> 48:13.347
- Oh no, not at all.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.265
What's up?

48:14.309 --> 48:15.224
- A woman came in last night

48:15.268 --> 48:16.684
asking about the
dress you liked.

48:16.728 --> 48:17.852
So if you want it,

48:17.896 --> 48:20.479
I'd go ahead and pull
the trigger on it.

48:20.523 --> 48:23.691
- Okay, can I come by
and take another look?

48:23.735 --> 48:24.567
- Absolutely.

48:35.038 --> 48:36.078
- Hmmm.

48:39.542 --> 48:40.708
- Anything?

48:40.752 --> 48:42.627
- No luck, sorry.

48:42.670 --> 48:43.961
- She's officially a Jane Doe

48:44.005 --> 48:46.172
until we find more information.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.382
Right now, we're all she's got.

48:48.426 --> 48:49.675
Take care of her.

48:49.719 --> 48:50.593
- Mm-hmm.

48:56.184 --> 48:58.225
- Hey, I've got the
dress hanging up.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.477
- Oh, you're awesome.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.228
Thank you so much
for doing this.

49:05.568 --> 49:06.567
- Okay, I'm gonna go try it on.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.569
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:14.202 --> 49:16.535
- Hey, is Carrie here?

49:16.579 --> 49:19.163
I like to ask her about
a bridesmaid's dress

49:19.207 --> 49:20.665
we saw in a magazine.

49:20.708 --> 49:21.582
- No, she had to run out

49:21.626 --> 49:23.209
and pick up some
office supplies,

49:23.252 --> 49:24.961
but I can help you with that.

49:25.964 --> 49:26.796
- That's okay.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.089
I'll just give her a call later.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.841
Hi.

49:30.885 --> 49:32.885
- You look so amazing.

49:32.929 --> 49:33.803
- Really?

49:34.931 --> 49:36.806
What do you think, Jordy?

49:36.849 --> 49:39.517
- Well, I had hoped you'd
pick something fancier,

49:39.560 --> 49:42.186
but you do look beautiful in it.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.523
- Oh my God, I love it.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.324
- Now, what do you think?

49:57.203 --> 49:58.077
- Yes, this is it.

49:58.121 --> 49:58.911
This is the one!

49:58.955 --> 49:59.996
This is my dress.

50:00.748 --> 50:01.539
- Let me grab some pins.

50:01.582 --> 50:03.624
I'll be right back.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.168
- Are you sure you trust
her to do the fitting?

50:06.212 --> 50:07.378
Would you rather for Carrie?

50:07.422 --> 50:08.504
- Oh, I'm sure she
knows what she's doing.

50:08.548 --> 50:10.006
Oh my God, I found my dress!

50:10.049 --> 50:11.090
Can you believe it?

50:12.510 --> 50:14.260
It's been forever.

50:14.303 --> 50:16.512
- And you do, you look
like an absolute angel.

50:16.556 --> 50:17.638
- Thank you.

50:17.682 --> 50:19.473
Should I add anything
to the waist or?

50:19.517 --> 50:21.017
- No, I think it's--

50:24.105 --> 50:25.563
- Such a relief.

50:27.025 --> 50:30.568
Oh, so Amy, I heard that you
were taking Jeff's class.

50:30.611 --> 50:33.696
- Yeah, I'm really
excited about it.

50:33.740 --> 50:36.282
I've been trying to expand
my business for a while now.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.784
Jeff's a great teacher.

50:40.621 --> 50:43.789
- Oh, that's really
sweet of you.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.791
I'll be sure to let
him know you think so.

50:54.552 --> 50:55.301
- Your phone's ringing.

50:55.344 --> 50:56.135
It's Amy.

50:56.179 --> 50:57.053
- Oh, thanks.

51:00.183 --> 51:01.057
Hey, Amy.

51:01.100 --> 51:01.891
- Hi.

51:01.934 --> 51:03.809
So I have some good news.

51:03.853 --> 51:05.728
The bakery said they have
an opening this weekend

51:05.772 --> 51:06.979
and they can have
the samples ready

51:07.023 --> 51:08.939
by 10 o'clock on Saturday.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.233
- I'll be at the
winery this weekend.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.193
- Oh, that's right.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.986
I completely forgot.

51:14.030 --> 51:16.238
Okay, what do you want me to do?

51:16.282 --> 51:18.032
I could pick one out for you.

51:18.076 --> 51:20.242
I'm not sure what
you like or want.

51:20.286 --> 51:21.410
- Oh, well, Jeff's here too.

51:21.454 --> 51:23.329
Maybe we just don't do a tasting

51:23.372 --> 51:24.789
and just pick the most
popular or something?

51:24.832 --> 51:26.916
- I mean, sure, you can do that,

51:26.959 --> 51:28.959
but she really likes for
someone from the wedding party

51:29.003 --> 51:30.795
to have a tasting beforehand.

51:30.838 --> 51:34.048
But you know, I know time is
tight, so whatever you want.

51:34.092 --> 51:35.174
- I mean, I can just go.

51:35.218 --> 51:37.218
- Yeah, I mean it's
just cake, right?

51:38.429 --> 51:40.179
Jeff said that he can
meet you there too.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.557
- Okay, sure.

51:43.601 --> 51:44.391
You know what?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.643
I'll make it easy on Jeff

51:45.686 --> 51:47.269
and I'll have the
samples sent to the shop

51:47.313 --> 51:48.479
and then he can just pop in.

51:48.523 --> 51:49.939
It will take no time at all.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.190
- All right, sounds good.

51:51.234 --> 51:52.399
See you there.

51:52.443 --> 51:53.776
- Perfect.

51:53.820 --> 51:56.195
Oh, and Macy, have a great
weekend at the winery.

51:56.239 --> 51:57.029
- Thanks.

51:58.658 --> 51:59.949
Easy enough, right?
-Yeah

52:02.870 --> 52:04.203
- It's a date.

52:14.465 --> 52:15.297
- Hi.

52:15.341 --> 52:16.298
- Welcome to Somerset Winery.

52:16.342 --> 52:17.508
How may I help you?

52:17.552 --> 52:19.844
- Yes, we have a room
for Macy and Jordy.

52:19.887 --> 52:20.636
- Wonderful.

52:20.680 --> 52:21.762
Thank you guys for coming.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.264
Who's the room under?

52:23.307 --> 52:24.765
- Mine, Macy.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.058
- And can I have ID

52:26.102 --> 52:27.309
and the credit card that
you put the room under?

52:27.353 --> 52:28.185
- Yes.

52:28.229 --> 52:31.021
Here is my ID and credit card.

52:31.065 --> 52:32.148
- Wonderful, thank you.

52:34.694 --> 52:37.361
Oh, it looks like you guys
are in the penthouse suite.

52:37.405 --> 52:38.529
Let me just grab
those keys for you.

52:38.573 --> 52:39.780
- Amazing.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.574
- Your room is gonna
be right down the hall.

52:41.617 --> 52:42.992
Have a wonderful time, ladies.

52:43.035 --> 52:43.993
- Thank you.

52:50.001 --> 52:52.168
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

52:52.211 --> 52:54.336
- Do you mind locking
the door behind you?

53:01.179 --> 53:01.969
- Door's locked.

53:08.352 --> 53:11.061
- So, what do you think?

53:11.105 --> 53:13.230
- Oh, me? Ahhh..

53:13.274 --> 53:15.482
Yeah, it looks nice.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.109
- Nice?

53:17.153 --> 53:18.944
This is for a bride
that wants her groom

53:18.988 --> 53:21.739
to remember this day for
the rest of his life.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.326
Do you think this dress
has what it takes?

53:26.537 --> 53:29.496
- Yeah, I'm pretty
sure that'll do it.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.665
- Good, thank you.

53:31.709 --> 53:34.585
It's always good to
have a man's opinion.

53:48.017 --> 53:50.184
- Oh, no champagne for me.

53:50.228 --> 53:51.602
Well, maybe one.

53:51.646 --> 53:52.770
- Good.

53:52.813 --> 53:53.938
Well, this will help
us to taste the cake

53:53.981 --> 53:55.356
as it will be on
your wedding day.

53:55.399 --> 53:57.107
- That's a good idea.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.359
- I think so.

54:01.697 --> 54:04.240
- Here, let's make a
toast to you and Macy.

54:04.283 --> 54:05.574
- Oh, sure.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.034
- Here, let's practice.

54:07.078 --> 54:09.995
Wrap your arm around
mine like that.

54:11.207 --> 54:13.040
To you and Macy.

54:21.759 --> 54:22.424
- Hey, Bobby?

54:22.468 --> 54:23.592
- Yeah, what's up, Bill?

54:23.636 --> 54:24.843
- When's the tech guy
gonna come in here

54:24.887 --> 54:25.970
and look at this phone?

54:26.013 --> 54:27.513
- He was supposed to
be here yesterday,

54:27.556 --> 54:29.515
but there was an emergency
over at the West Side station.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.517
- Well, this needs to
be his next emergency.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.102
I've got a Jane Doe in a coma.

54:33.145 --> 54:34.645
I want this phone unlocked.

54:34.689 --> 54:36.230
I want to find out who she is.

54:36.274 --> 54:37.898
- You've got it, Bill.

54:37.942 --> 54:38.774
- Thanks.

54:42.613 --> 54:43.279
- Can't wait for this.

54:43.322 --> 54:44.154
- I know, so excited.

54:46.075 --> 54:47.533
- Oh, how cute.

54:47.576 --> 54:51.370
Cucumber water.
- Little cucumbers.

54:51.414 --> 54:52.246
- Okay.

54:54.000 --> 54:54.999
Ooh, got it?

55:02.300 --> 55:03.215
- Mm, oh, that is amazing.

55:03.259 --> 55:04.425
- Yeah?

55:04.468 --> 55:05.634
I told you.

55:05.678 --> 55:07.052
She's one of the best.

55:07.096 --> 55:07.803
- Hmm.

55:07.847 --> 55:08.846
You want to try it?

55:08.889 --> 55:09.763
- Oh.

55:16.689 --> 55:18.314
Oh my God.

55:18.357 --> 55:20.691
It's like, you don't even
have to try the rest.

55:22.320 --> 55:23.193
- All right.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.737
And we're just getting started.

55:24.780 --> 55:25.612
What's next?

55:32.121 --> 55:35.956
- This would be so much
easier with a fork, right?

55:36.000 --> 55:39.126
This one is a chocolate
raspberry truffle cake

55:39.170 --> 55:40.377
with a chocolate ganache.

55:42.465 --> 55:44.798
- Yeah, the first one's better.

55:44.842 --> 55:45.841
- Oh, crap.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.974
- This feels so good.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.768
- It's the perfect thing
to ease the tension.

55:55.811 --> 55:57.102
- Mm-hmm.

55:57.938 --> 56:00.272
This water is amazing.

56:00.316 --> 56:01.857
Why don't we do this at home?

56:01.901 --> 56:02.900
- I know, right?

56:04.945 --> 56:05.527
- Hey, Mace,

56:06.697 --> 56:08.530
how did you know that
Jeff was the one?

56:10.117 --> 56:15.204
Was it like love at first
sight or more of a cat thing?

56:16.499 --> 56:17.831
- A cat thing?

56:17.875 --> 56:19.041
- Yeah.

56:19.085 --> 56:20.918
You know, like you
act like you like him

56:20.961 --> 56:23.545
and then pretend you
don't for a while.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.341
- And then at suppertime,
you always come around?

56:27.385 --> 56:29.301
- Yeah, right.

56:29.345 --> 56:31.553
Oh my God, it was
a total cat thing.

56:31.597 --> 56:33.013
- No, no.

56:33.057 --> 56:35.182
It's you think he's handsome

56:35.226 --> 56:39.061
and then he becomes
goofy, and funny,

56:39.105 --> 56:40.813
and then the handsome
kind of goes away

56:40.856 --> 56:43.273
and that's how you
know he's the one.

56:44.443 --> 56:45.984
- You don't think
he's handsome anymore?

56:46.028 --> 56:47.277
- No, no, no.

56:47.321 --> 56:48.320
I definitely think
he's handsome,

56:48.364 --> 56:52.574
but kind of think
he's mostly sexy.

56:52.618 --> 56:53.867
- Really?

56:53.911 --> 56:55.244
- Yeah.

56:55.287 --> 56:56.912
I mean, don't you
think he's sexy?

56:56.956 --> 56:58.205
No, no, no.

56:58.249 --> 57:00.541
Actually, I don't want
to know what you think.

57:02.002 --> 57:04.086
- Okay, so just let me make
sure I got this straight.

57:04.130 --> 57:07.047
So you find a guy
that's handsome,

57:07.091 --> 57:08.215
then you find out that
he's kind of dorky,

57:08.259 --> 57:09.425
and that makes him sexy,

57:09.468 --> 57:11.927
and then you know that
he's the one, right?

57:13.222 --> 57:14.596
- Yeah.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.306
And I can trust him.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.684
- This has gotten
very complicated.

57:21.689 --> 57:23.605
I'm going to stick
to simple things

57:23.732 --> 57:26.400
like the simplicity of
this fabulous cucumber.

57:28.863 --> 57:29.903
- We gotta get it done.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.280
- Yeah, I'm on it.

57:31.323 --> 57:33.073
But look, there's some
complicated issues on this case.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.241
- You okay?

57:34.285 --> 57:35.784
- Yeah, it's just
gonna take more time.

57:35.828 --> 57:37.828
- Did you get the fax?

57:37.872 --> 57:38.787
- What?
- The fax?

57:38.831 --> 57:39.788
- You sent me a fax?

57:39.832 --> 57:40.998
- Yes.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.833
- All right, I'll go look.

57:42.877 --> 57:44.042
Yeah.

57:44.086 --> 57:45.294
- So when you get the fax,

57:45.337 --> 57:47.463
look at the bottom to
see the evidence list.

57:51.302 --> 57:54.553
- This one is the
pink champagne cake

57:54.597 --> 57:56.722
with a hazelnut buttercream.

57:56.765 --> 57:57.598
- Oh.

58:06.692 --> 58:08.984
Mm, I think that's the one.

58:09.028 --> 58:10.527
- You can't pick
a winner already.

58:10.571 --> 58:12.404
You have several more to try.

58:12.448 --> 58:14.573
- Macy likes hazelnut,
so it's a safe bet.

58:14.617 --> 58:15.949
- Come on.

58:15.993 --> 58:17.701
The baker went to all this
trouble to make these.

58:17.745 --> 58:19.328
You should at least try them.

58:19.371 --> 58:20.913
- Pink champagne it is.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.122
- You sure?

58:22.166 --> 58:24.249
- Yeah, it's the best one.

58:24.293 --> 58:25.167
- Jeff?

58:26.128 --> 58:27.461
- Yes?

58:27.505 --> 58:29.296
- Do you want to take
some take some cake home?

58:29.340 --> 58:30.714
- No, that's fine.

58:30.758 --> 58:33.175
It'll be a nice surprise
for Macy on her wedding day.

58:33.219 --> 58:35.719
- I need to know what size
cake you want to order.

58:35.763 --> 58:37.721
- What would you recommend?

58:37.765 --> 58:39.139
- Well, I think the
three tier cakes

58:39.183 --> 58:40.307
look better than the two.

58:40.351 --> 58:41.517
Here, I have some
pictures on my phone.

58:41.560 --> 58:42.643
- Three tier sounds great.

58:42.686 --> 58:44.520
As long as it's
enough for 50 people.

58:44.563 --> 58:45.896
Look, I gotta run.

58:45.940 --> 58:47.648
Thank you so much for
setting all this up.

58:47.691 --> 58:50.317
- Don't forget about your
tux fitting in the morning.

58:50.361 --> 58:52.236
Carrie wanted me to remind you.

58:52.279 --> 58:53.070
- I'll be here.

58:56.742 --> 58:58.325
- Damn it, I'm such an idiot.

59:08.295 --> 59:09.878
- Call Wyatt.

59:09.922 --> 59:11.129
Calling Wyatt.

59:12.466 --> 59:13.507
- Hey, what's up, man?

59:13.551 --> 59:15.634
- Hey, what are
you doing tomorrow?

59:20.182 --> 59:21.181
- Did you
find any witnesses?

59:21.225 --> 59:21.974
- Yeah, there were
three witnesses.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.225
- Good.
- I know.

59:23.269 --> 59:25.811
- You've got the fax?
- Yeah, I've got the fax.

59:25.854 --> 59:27.229
- Do you see it?

59:27.273 --> 59:29.398
- Okay, what exactly am I
supposed to be looking at?

59:29.441 --> 59:30.357
- There's a
list of evidence.

59:30.401 --> 59:31.858
- Is this at the scene?

59:31.902 --> 59:32.901
- Yes.

59:32.945 --> 59:33.777
- Yeah.

59:38.826 --> 59:40.742
Hey, Bob, this is my daughter.

59:40.786 --> 59:41.952
Let me call you right back.

59:41.996 --> 59:43.328
- Call me back.
- All right.

59:45.249 --> 59:46.206
Hey, kiddo.

59:46.250 --> 59:47.291
- Hi, daddy.

59:47.334 --> 59:48.333
- What are you up to?

59:49.336 --> 59:50.419
- I'm not sure.

59:51.130 --> 59:52.629
- What do you mean?

59:52.673 --> 59:54.298
- The wedding shop owner
who has been helping us out

59:54.341 --> 59:55.799
has been out sick a lot lately

59:55.843 --> 59:58.927
and we've been
worried about her.

59:59.930 --> 1:00:01.179
- Worried how?

1:00:01.223 --> 1:00:04.391
- We haven't seen Carrie
for about a week or so.

1:00:04.435 --> 1:00:06.935
Amy has taken over the shop
ever since she's been out.

1:00:08.022 --> 1:00:09.396
- Have you had any
contact with her?

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.106
- No, no contact.

1:00:11.150 --> 1:00:14.443
I just called her
phone, but no answer.

1:00:14.486 --> 1:00:17.779
- Look, why don't you text
me her full name and number.

1:00:17.823 --> 1:00:21.116
And when I get some time, I'll
try to locate her for you.

1:00:21.285 --> 1:00:22.117
- Thank you, dad.

1:00:22.161 --> 1:00:23.869
That would be so great.

1:00:23.912 --> 1:00:24.119
- All right, baby.

1:00:26.624 --> 1:00:28.040
- Cheer
Squads, this is Angel.

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:30.751
- Hi, I'm calling about a
bachelor party reservation.

1:00:30.794 --> 1:00:33.920
It's either under Jeff
Dardenswick or Wyatt Morrison.

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:35.130
- Let's see.

1:00:35.174 --> 1:00:36.548
Yes, I have a party
for Jeff on the 14th.

1:00:36.592 --> 1:00:37.591
- Yes.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:39.343
His wife was in a
terrible accident.

1:00:39.386 --> 1:00:40.427
I need to cancel that.

1:00:40.471 --> 1:00:41.845
- I'm so
sorry to hear that.

1:00:41.889 --> 1:00:43.138
Okay, that party's canceled.

1:00:43.182 --> 1:00:44.348
- Thanks so much.

1:00:48.479 --> 1:00:49.978
- Go for Wyatt.

1:00:50.022 --> 1:00:51.396
- Hi, Wyatt.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.148
This is Monique
from Cheer Squads.

1:00:53.192 --> 1:00:54.358
I'm just calling to confirm

1:00:54.401 --> 1:00:57.402
your at home bachelor
party on the 14th.

1:00:57.446 --> 1:00:58.362
- At home?

1:00:58.405 --> 1:00:59.112
No, no, no, no.

1:00:59.406 --> 1:01:00.447
We're going to the club.

1:01:00.491 --> 1:01:02.866
I made a reservation
for six people.

1:01:02.910 --> 1:01:05.202
- Oh, well, there
must've been some mix up.

1:01:05.245 --> 1:01:07.120
I have three girls
coming to your house

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:10.290
for a VIP bachelor party.

1:01:10.334 --> 1:01:13.919
- Okay, can we please
fix that error?

1:01:13.962 --> 1:01:16.463
- Unfortunately, the
club is all booked up,

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:19.549
but I can give you a
discount on the VIP party.

1:01:19.593 --> 1:01:23.929
That package costs twice what
the in club package costs.

1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:25.013
- I don't know.

1:01:25.057 --> 1:01:28.058
You said three
dancers for how long?

1:01:28.102 --> 1:01:29.351
- Two hours.

1:01:29.395 --> 1:01:32.062
And those girls aren't
fettered by club rules,

1:01:32.106 --> 1:01:33.563
if you know what I mean.

1:01:33.607 --> 1:01:34.815
- I see.

1:01:34.858 --> 1:01:36.942
- Oh again, sorry
for the mix up.

1:01:36.985 --> 1:01:39.611
I'll confirm your
address the morning of.

1:01:39.655 --> 1:01:40.904
- Sounds good.

1:02:05.973 --> 1:02:07.139
- Hi, this is Carrie.

1:02:07.182 --> 1:02:09.433
I hope there are wedding
bells in your future.

1:02:09.476 --> 1:02:11.518
Leave a message and
I'll call you back.

1:02:17.192 --> 1:02:18.316
- Jeff, you did not tell me

1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:20.777
that your wedding
planner was this hot.

1:02:20.821 --> 1:02:21.653
- Relax.

1:02:21.697 --> 1:02:23.739
You think every woman is hot.

1:02:23.782 --> 1:02:25.657
- Are you sure that this
is the first kiss girl,

1:02:25.701 --> 1:02:27.367
the spin the bottle thing?

1:02:28.579 --> 1:02:29.870
- Yep, that's her.

1:02:31.707 --> 1:02:32.873
- Well done.

1:02:32.916 --> 1:02:34.916
- All right, who's first?

1:02:37.421 --> 1:02:37.878
- I'll dive in.

1:03:06.116 --> 1:03:06.865
- Hey, what's going on?

1:03:06.909 --> 1:03:07.741
What's the rush?

1:03:07.785 --> 1:03:09.493
I was just packing to go home.

1:03:09.536 --> 1:03:12.412
- Mace, you're not
gonna like this.

1:03:12.456 --> 1:03:13.455
- Oh no, is it Jeff?

1:03:13.499 --> 1:03:15.332
- No, it's not about Jeff.

1:03:15.375 --> 1:03:16.208
- Okay, well, what is it?

1:03:16.251 --> 1:03:18.752
You can't just leave me hanging.

1:03:18.837 --> 1:03:20.003
- Let's talk about Amy.

1:03:20.881 --> 1:03:21.588
- Oh no, now what?

1:03:23.008 --> 1:03:25.550
- She has a restraining
order taken out against her.

1:03:25.594 --> 1:03:26.843
- What?

1:03:26.887 --> 1:03:28.470
A restraining order?

1:03:29.848 --> 1:03:31.473
Where did you even find this?

1:03:32.476 --> 1:03:34.434
- Online record search

1:03:34.478 --> 1:03:35.727
costs me 3.99.

1:03:37.189 --> 1:03:41.191
- Well, that's scary, but
I guess really good for us.

1:03:41.235 --> 1:03:42.901
Okay, well, what does it say?

1:03:42.945 --> 1:03:45.320
- Amy could be
psychotic and dangerous.

1:03:46.406 --> 1:03:47.572
- I didn't get
that vibe from her.

1:03:47.616 --> 1:03:50.075
I mean, did she
threaten you in any way?

1:03:50.118 --> 1:03:51.368
- Nope, you?

1:03:51.411 --> 1:03:52.744
- No.

1:03:52.788 --> 1:03:55.121
- Look, I got a
feeling about her,

1:03:55.165 --> 1:03:58.375
but psychotic and
dangerous wasn't it.

1:03:58.418 --> 1:03:59.292
- Okay.

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:00.001
Well, is there anything else?

1:04:00.045 --> 1:04:01.711
- Yes, it gets worse.

1:04:03.090 --> 1:04:04.422
The court ordered her to
stay away from this guy,

1:04:04.466 --> 1:04:06.258
Thomas Mannit.

1:04:06.301 --> 1:04:07.467
- Okay.

1:04:07.511 --> 1:04:09.177
Well, maybe they were
girlfriend and boyfriend

1:04:09.221 --> 1:04:10.595
and got into a fight

1:04:10.639 --> 1:04:13.431
and so then he filed a
restraining order against her.

1:04:13.475 --> 1:04:17.686
- It could be, but then I
looked up Thomas Mannit.

1:04:17.729 --> 1:04:19.521
Look, here's the news story.

1:04:19.565 --> 1:04:21.273
- Oh my God.

1:04:21.316 --> 1:04:22.607
When did this happen?

1:04:22.651 --> 1:04:25.902
- It just happened like
three or four days ago.

1:04:25.946 --> 1:04:27.279
Shot to death.

1:04:27.322 --> 1:04:30.949
Macy, it was probably Amy.

1:04:30.993 --> 1:04:32.075
- I mean, I know the
restraining order

1:04:32.119 --> 1:04:32.826
makes it seem that way,

1:04:32.870 --> 1:04:34.286
but I just,

1:04:34.329 --> 1:04:36.955
I really don't think she's
capable of something like this.

1:04:36.999 --> 1:04:38.957
- Honestly, I don't
think so either,

1:04:39.001 --> 1:04:42.002
but do you really want
to take that chance?

1:04:44.006 --> 1:04:45.338
- Oh my God.

1:04:45.382 --> 1:04:46.840
She's alone right now with
Jeff at the bridal shop

1:04:46.884 --> 1:04:48.675
doing a tux fitting.

1:04:48.719 --> 1:04:49.593
- Let's go.

1:04:49.636 --> 1:04:50.552
Let's just call him on the way.

1:04:58.478 --> 1:04:59.603
- Nice try, Jeff.

1:04:59.646 --> 1:05:01.688
If you really trusted
yourself with me,

1:05:01.732 --> 1:05:03.398
you wouldn't have
brought Wyatt along.

1:05:06.862 --> 1:05:08.153
- Oh my god, I was so worried.

1:05:08.196 --> 1:05:09.279
- Hey, yeah, I got your message.

1:05:09.323 --> 1:05:10.405
What's going on?

1:05:10.449 --> 1:05:11.698
- So, Jordy has been
suspicious of Amy

1:05:11.742 --> 1:05:12.782
ever since she met her.

1:05:12.826 --> 1:05:14.659
I mean, call it
women's intuition,

1:05:14.703 --> 1:05:17.829
but we were on our trip
at the Somerset Winery.

1:05:17.873 --> 1:05:19.581
- Hey, I've packed your bag.

1:05:20.542 --> 1:05:22.000
- Oh, thanks.

1:05:22.044 --> 1:05:25.295
Yes, so then Jordy found a
restraining order against Amy.

1:05:25.422 --> 1:05:26.713
- Against Amy?

1:05:26.757 --> 1:05:27.505
She seems so nice.

1:05:27.549 --> 1:05:28.965
- I know, but get this.

1:05:29.009 --> 1:05:33.094
The guy is, or well, should
I say was, Thomas Mannit.

1:05:33.597 --> 1:05:34.512
He's dead.

1:05:34.556 --> 1:05:36.848
Shot to death in his own home.

1:05:36.892 --> 1:05:38.016
- Wow, that's pretty serious.

1:05:38.060 --> 1:05:39.142
When?

1:05:39.186 --> 1:05:40.310
- It just happened.

1:05:40.354 --> 1:05:42.395
We just found the
news article online.

1:05:42.439 --> 1:05:44.356
- And you think Amy did that?

1:05:44.399 --> 1:05:46.483
- Well, she seems like the
perfect suspect, right?

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:47.817
- Maybe.

1:05:47.861 --> 1:05:49.110
I'm just not getting
that vibe from her.

1:05:49.154 --> 1:05:50.612
- I know, me either.

1:05:50.656 --> 1:05:52.197
I mean, she's been
so nice to us.

1:05:54.451 --> 1:05:57.744
Wait, what kind of vibe
are you getting from her?

1:05:59.164 --> 1:06:00.038
- Well...

1:06:01.500 --> 1:06:03.124
- Why do I feel like you're
about to tell me something

1:06:03.168 --> 1:06:04.167
I'm not gonna like?

1:06:04.211 --> 1:06:05.460
- Oh no, no, no,
nothing like that.

1:06:05.504 --> 1:06:06.252
Come on, Mace.

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:07.128
I love you.

1:06:08.423 --> 1:06:09.673
- Then what?

1:06:09.716 --> 1:06:12.509
- Amy sorta came onto
me at the cake tasting.

1:06:13.512 --> 1:06:15.720
- She came on to you?

1:06:15.806 --> 1:06:16.972
How?

1:06:17.015 --> 1:06:21.226
- She wore kind of
a sexy wedding gown.

1:06:21.269 --> 1:06:24.354
- She wore a wedding down
to your cake tasting?

1:06:24.398 --> 1:06:25.271
- Yeah, a wedding gown.

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:26.314
That's strange, right?

1:06:30.362 --> 1:06:32.195
- What did this gown look like?

1:06:33.573 --> 1:06:35.198
- It was kind of
lacy through here.

1:06:35.242 --> 1:06:37.325
White flowers around the neck.

1:06:37.369 --> 1:06:38.284
Tight through here.

1:06:40.330 --> 1:06:41.454
Floofy at the bottom.

1:06:53.343 --> 1:06:55.510
- You
have one new message.

1:06:55.554 --> 1:06:57.804
- We just don't know
what to do, Detective.

1:06:57.848 --> 1:07:00.015
- Sounds like this
Amy's a real piece of work.

1:07:00.058 --> 1:07:02.225
Unfortunately, there's
not a lot I can do.

1:07:02.269 --> 1:07:03.560
I'll have someone run
a background check

1:07:03.603 --> 1:07:04.686
when I get back to the station.

1:07:04.730 --> 1:07:05.854
- Thank you.

1:07:05.897 --> 1:07:07.897
- In the
meantime, tell your wife

1:07:07.941 --> 1:07:10.108
that I'd advise her
not to go see Amy.

1:07:10.152 --> 1:07:11.901
- Yeah, better safe than sorry.

1:07:11.945 --> 1:07:13.653
- Okay,
I'll be in touch.

1:07:14.865 --> 1:07:15.530
- Hey, Mace.

1:07:15.574 --> 1:07:16.740
I'm stuck in traffic,

1:07:16.783 --> 1:07:17.949
but I'll meet you
there in five, okay?

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:20.035
Bye.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:36.342
- Macy, hi.

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:37.635
How was your girl's weekend?

1:07:37.679 --> 1:07:39.804
- Oh, it was good.

1:07:39.848 --> 1:07:41.097
- I have got your
dress in my office.

1:07:41.141 --> 1:07:42.515
I'll go get it and
you can try it on.

1:07:42.559 --> 1:07:45.060
- Listen, we actually need
to talk about a few things

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:47.228
- About what?

1:07:48.190 --> 1:07:49.272
- Okay.

1:07:49.316 --> 1:07:52.108
Well, Jeff and I
appreciate everything

1:07:52.152 --> 1:07:53.443
that you've done
for the wedding,

1:07:53.487 --> 1:07:55.945
but we have decided to elope.

1:07:55.989 --> 1:07:58.782
Just us two, a small like
no frills type of ceremony.

1:07:58.825 --> 1:08:00.283
- Why?

1:08:00.327 --> 1:08:02.202
Why would you do that?

1:08:02.245 --> 1:08:04.537
- Because that's
what we want to do.

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:11.419
- After all the time I've spent

1:08:11.463 --> 1:08:15.256
planning the perfect wedding
for you guys for free,

1:08:19.054 --> 1:08:21.638
this is how you repay me?

1:08:21.681 --> 1:08:22.388
- Jeff and I understand
all the effort

1:08:22.432 --> 1:08:23.556
that you've been through

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:26.184
and we're happy to
pay you for your time.

1:08:26.228 --> 1:08:27.602
What do you think
is a fair amount?

1:08:27.729 --> 1:08:28.812
- Fair?

1:08:28.855 --> 1:08:31.439
Oh, you want to talk
about what's fair?

1:08:31.483 --> 1:08:33.650
Nothing is fair.

1:08:33.693 --> 1:08:35.527
Life isn't fair.

1:08:36.655 --> 1:08:38.655
Some people get to
marry their first loves.

1:08:38.698 --> 1:08:39.656
Others don't.

1:08:41.660 --> 1:08:43.118
You think that's fair?

1:08:44.329 --> 1:08:45.495
- Amy, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:08:45.539 --> 1:08:46.788
- Of course you don't.

1:08:46.832 --> 1:08:48.289
You get whatever you want.

1:08:48.333 --> 1:08:50.959
Then when you don't want it
anymore, you throw it away.

1:08:51.795 --> 1:08:53.711
Who cares that I
pulled in favors

1:08:53.755 --> 1:08:56.297
so you guys could
even have a wedding?

1:08:56.341 --> 1:08:57.882
Ridiculously low budget.

1:08:59.511 --> 1:09:00.802
You're so ungrateful.

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:05.890
- Look, I'm just
going to get my dress

1:09:06.017 --> 1:09:07.600
and then I'm going to leave.

1:09:07.644 --> 1:09:08.685
- Hey, guys.

1:09:08.728 --> 1:09:10.895
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1:09:10.939 --> 1:09:12.814
- You couldn't have come
at a better time, Jordy.

1:09:12.858 --> 1:09:13.773
Let's get my dress.

1:09:16.111 --> 1:09:17.360
- You have no right
to be back here.

1:09:17.404 --> 1:09:18.570
- I'm taking that dress.

1:09:24.035 --> 1:09:25.577
- Oh my god.

1:09:28.206 --> 1:09:29.873
- It's not what you think.

1:09:29.916 --> 1:09:31.166
- Not what you think?

1:09:32.669 --> 1:09:35.044
- Is that my dress?

1:09:35.088 --> 1:09:37.338
It has frosting and
champagne on it.

1:09:38.842 --> 1:09:40.300
You're such a bitch, Amy.

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:41.426
- Let's get out of here.

1:09:41.469 --> 1:09:42.969
- You stay away from
me and my husband.

1:09:51.855 --> 1:09:53.855
Oh my God, she's insane.

1:09:53.899 --> 1:09:54.814
Thank you so much for coming.

1:09:54.858 --> 1:09:55.690
- Oh, of course.

1:09:55.734 --> 1:09:57.275
- Wait, Jordy, are you bleeding?

1:09:57.319 --> 1:09:58.359
- I don't think so.

1:09:58.570 --> 1:09:59.652
It doesn't hurt.

1:09:59.696 --> 1:10:01.237
- Well, it looks really deep.

1:10:01.281 --> 1:10:02.280
We'll go to the ER and get
you some stitches, okay?

1:10:02.324 --> 1:10:02.989
- Oh man.

1:10:12.876 --> 1:10:14.334
- Yeah, well, it
really upset Macy.

1:10:14.377 --> 1:10:17.128
I'm feel like going over there
and just going off on her,

1:10:17.172 --> 1:10:19.547
but Macy thinks it's best
to keep our distance.

1:10:19.591 --> 1:10:20.882
- Definitely put
as much distance

1:10:20.926 --> 1:10:23.259
between yourself and that crazy.

1:10:23.303 --> 1:10:25.470
- Oh, by the way, Macy
says she's mad at you.

1:10:25.513 --> 1:10:27.222
- Look, this party
better be great

1:10:27.265 --> 1:10:29.474
'cause I'm gonna be in
the dog house with Macy

1:10:29.517 --> 1:10:31.476
pretty much the rest of my life.

1:10:31.519 --> 1:10:32.769
- We should cancel tonight.

1:10:32.812 --> 1:10:34.145
It's a bad idea,
don't you think?

1:10:34.189 --> 1:10:35.521
- No, no, no.

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:36.481
Jeff, come on.

1:10:36.524 --> 1:10:37.398
Look.

1:10:37.442 --> 1:10:38.983
The party's not really for you.

1:10:39.027 --> 1:10:41.736
It's for us, your
immature friends.

1:10:41.821 --> 1:10:44.864
So please have a beer, relax.

1:10:46.034 --> 1:10:47.075
We'll have a good time.

1:10:48.245 --> 1:10:50.119
- What time are the
other guys getting here?

1:10:50.163 --> 1:10:51.120
- They're on the way.

1:10:52.249 --> 1:10:53.957
So, take a deep breath.

1:10:56.253 --> 1:10:57.252
We got this.

1:10:58.546 --> 1:10:59.379
- All right.

1:10:59.422 --> 1:11:00.171
All right, let's go.

1:11:00.215 --> 1:11:01.005
Let's go.

1:11:03.051 --> 1:11:04.717
- Are you sure you're okay?

1:11:04.761 --> 1:11:06.094
- Yes, it's fine.

1:11:06.137 --> 1:11:07.637
I'm more worried about you.

1:11:07.681 --> 1:11:09.847
We should be focusing on you.

1:11:09.891 --> 1:11:11.099
Speaking of that,

1:11:11.142 --> 1:11:14.060
where did they decide to
have the bachelor party?

1:11:14.104 --> 1:11:16.479
- Oh, just at
Jeff's dad's house.

1:11:16.523 --> 1:11:18.106
- You doing okay
with everything?

1:11:19.651 --> 1:11:20.900
- Mmm hmmm. Yeah.

1:11:20.944 --> 1:11:22.110
Jeff's a good guy.

1:11:22.195 --> 1:11:23.444
- I agree.

1:11:24.990 --> 1:11:25.822
- Keep your masks on.

1:11:25.865 --> 1:11:26.823
You can have any guy you want,

1:11:26.866 --> 1:11:28.366
but stay away from the bachelor.

1:11:37.627 --> 1:11:38.334
Party's here.

1:11:39.671 --> 1:11:42.672
- I really think it's
more for Wyatt anyways.

1:11:42.716 --> 1:11:43.923
- You know, I
think you're right.

1:11:43.967 --> 1:11:45.967
Wyatt would be such a good catch

1:11:46.011 --> 1:11:48.344
if he would just grow up.

1:11:48.555 --> 1:11:51.097
- That is never gonna happen.
- Nuh-uh.

1:12:25.425 --> 1:12:27.342
- The guys have a
surprise upstairs.

1:12:29.429 --> 1:12:30.219
Come on.

1:12:37.312 --> 1:12:39.312
- I told you not
to do this, man.

1:12:39.647 --> 1:12:41.230
- Yeah!

1:12:44.527 --> 1:12:46.277
- It's in here, come on.

1:12:46.321 --> 1:12:47.028
- No, come on.

1:12:47.072 --> 1:12:48.154
This room's off limits.

1:12:49.616 --> 1:12:51.908
- You must have had a lot
of fantasies as a teenager.

1:12:51.951 --> 1:12:54.369
Why don't you tell
me what those were?

1:12:54.412 --> 1:12:55.244
- Come on.

1:12:55.288 --> 1:12:56.079
Let's go back out.

1:12:57.957 --> 1:12:59.082
- Just one kiss.

1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:02.585
I can do more for
you than Macy can.

1:13:04.297 --> 1:13:05.963
- How do you know
my fiance's name?

1:13:06.007 --> 1:13:08.091
- Just one night, one
night with me, Jeff,

1:13:08.134 --> 1:13:09.717
and you can have
the same boring sex

1:13:09.761 --> 1:13:11.010
for the rest of your life.

1:13:11.930 --> 1:13:12.762
- Amy?

1:13:13.890 --> 1:13:15.348
Take your mask off.

1:13:15.392 --> 1:13:16.974
- Oh, Jeff, come on.

1:13:18.395 --> 1:13:19.769
- Take it off.

1:13:19.813 --> 1:13:23.231
- Why don't want me to take
other things off first?

1:13:23.274 --> 1:13:23.689
- Take it off.

1:13:28.405 --> 1:13:30.405
You manipulative psycho.

1:13:30.448 --> 1:13:31.781
Get out of my house.

1:13:31.825 --> 1:13:32.949
Get out.

1:13:32.992 --> 1:13:34.909
- There's the passion
I was hoping for.

1:13:34.953 --> 1:13:36.619
I knew it was in
there somewhere.

1:13:37.997 --> 1:13:38.746
- Get them out of here.

1:13:38.790 --> 1:13:39.622
Get them all out.

1:13:39.666 --> 1:13:41.040
- What the hell?

1:13:41.084 --> 1:13:42.417
Oh, what the hell?

1:13:43.628 --> 1:13:45.628
I'll get the other one.

1:13:45.672 --> 1:13:46.879
- I will ruin you.

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:49.132
Do you understand?

1:13:49.175 --> 1:13:51.551
Well, just wait until you
go to school on Monday.

1:13:51.594 --> 1:13:53.094
- I won't be at
school on Monday.

1:13:53.138 --> 1:13:54.220
I'm going to be
at the courthouse

1:13:54.264 --> 1:13:56.639
filing a restraining
order against you.

1:13:56.683 --> 1:13:58.724
This better be the
last time I see you.

1:13:58.768 --> 1:14:00.101
- This isn't over.

1:14:01.479 --> 1:14:03.521
- Oh yes, it is.

1:14:03.606 --> 1:14:05.106
Goodbye.

1:14:05.150 --> 1:14:07.108
- I am so mad right now.

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:12.113
I can't believe Wyatt would
do something like this.

1:14:12.157 --> 1:14:13.448
- Oh no, this wasn't Wyatt.

1:14:13.491 --> 1:14:14.907
No, this was definitely Amy.

1:14:14.951 --> 1:14:17.702
I mean, she orchestrated
this entire night.

1:14:17.745 --> 1:14:18.870
I don't even know
how she did it.

1:14:18.913 --> 1:14:20.413
Hell, Wyatt doesn't
know how she did it

1:14:20.457 --> 1:14:21.581
and he planned the night.

1:14:21.624 --> 1:14:22.957
- Well then,

1:14:23.001 --> 1:14:24.292
you're going to have to
file a restraining order.

1:14:24.335 --> 1:14:27.086
- Yeah, I'll do that
first thing Monday.

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:28.880
- Look, I'm sorry.

1:14:28.923 --> 1:14:31.090
I'm the one who let
her into our lives

1:14:31.134 --> 1:14:33.092
and then look what happened.

1:14:33.136 --> 1:14:34.635
- You know what I
don't understand?

1:14:35.805 --> 1:14:39.015
If she was so obsessed,
why wait until now?

1:14:39.893 --> 1:14:42.059
I mean, I'm not hard to find.

1:14:42.103 --> 1:14:43.519
- Probably because
she was still obsessed

1:14:43.563 --> 1:14:44.979
with Thomas Mannit.

1:14:45.023 --> 1:14:46.397
- Yeah, and if she killed him,

1:14:46.441 --> 1:14:48.065
then that restraining order
did nothing to save him.

1:14:50.195 --> 1:14:51.611
She did say this isn't over.

1:14:58.411 --> 1:14:59.994
- Hi, Dean Cahill?
- This is Dean Cahill.

1:15:00.038 --> 1:15:02.163
- I understand that you're
Jeff Dardenswick's boss?

1:15:02.207 --> 1:15:02.914
- Yes, I am.

1:15:02.957 --> 1:15:04.415
- Oh, good.

1:15:04.459 --> 1:15:06.125
Well, I would like to file a
sexual harassment complaint

1:15:06.169 --> 1:15:07.793
against Mr. Dardenswick.

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:09.045
- This is a
very serious charge.

1:15:09.088 --> 1:15:10.713
- Yes, I know it's serious.

1:15:12.008 --> 1:15:13.758
- Ma'am, ma'am?

1:15:13.801 --> 1:15:15.384
- Sorry.

1:15:15.428 --> 1:15:18.012
But I do have a witness.

1:15:18.932 --> 1:15:20.223
Her name is Dylan.

1:15:20.266 --> 1:15:21.098
- His teaching assistant?

1:15:21.142 --> 1:15:22.975
- Yes, his teaching assistant.

1:15:23.019 --> 1:15:24.101
Well, I spoke with her

1:15:24.145 --> 1:15:25.811
and she's willing
to sign an affidavit

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:27.939
swearing to what she saw.

1:15:27.982 --> 1:15:30.107
- This is a very
serious accusation.

1:15:30.151 --> 1:15:31.734
I will look into it immediately.

1:15:35.198 --> 1:15:36.072
- Babe, what's wrong?

1:15:36.115 --> 1:15:37.907
What's the emergency?

1:15:37.951 --> 1:15:40.117
- I'm on administrative leave.

1:15:40.161 --> 1:15:41.536
- What?

1:15:41.788 --> 1:15:43.162
Why?

1:15:43.248 --> 1:15:44.830
- She's trying to
ruin my career.

1:15:44.874 --> 1:15:46.791
She said I came on to
her during office hours.

1:15:46.834 --> 1:15:48.584
She even got my assistant
Dylan to sign a statement

1:15:48.628 --> 1:15:51.212
saying she saw me
hug Amy in my office.

1:15:51.256 --> 1:15:52.421
- Are you kidding me?

1:15:53.758 --> 1:15:56.467
Well, did you hug Amy?

1:15:56.511 --> 1:15:57.468
- Yeah, but it was
just a friendly hug.

1:15:57.512 --> 1:15:58.678
It was nothing,

1:15:58.721 --> 1:16:00.763
but Dylan walked in
right at that moment.

1:16:00.807 --> 1:16:02.473
- She's very convincing
and deceptive.

1:16:02.517 --> 1:16:03.349
- She needs help.

1:16:03.393 --> 1:16:05.601
- No, she needs to go to jail.

1:16:05.645 --> 1:16:07.645
- For what, lying?

1:16:07.689 --> 1:16:10.147
I mean, what has she
really done that's illegal?

1:16:10.191 --> 1:16:12.817
- Filing a false report of
sexual harassment for one.

1:16:12.860 --> 1:16:14.402
- I get what you're saying, but.

1:16:16.823 --> 1:16:18.531
- Gosh, I want this
nightmare to end.

1:16:21.953 --> 1:16:23.452
- Come dance with me, Mace.

1:16:23.496 --> 1:16:26.581
Let's take a few minutes and
just forget about everything.

1:16:26.624 --> 1:16:28.541
- This is nice, thank you.

1:16:28.585 --> 1:16:30.209
Feeling better already.

1:16:30.253 --> 1:16:33.629
- Jeff, Jeff,
Jeff, long time, no see.

1:16:33.673 --> 1:16:34.964
- You were even my first kiss.

1:16:35.008 --> 1:16:36.757
- You promised
to marry me.

1:16:36.843 --> 1:16:38.050
This is not what you think.

1:16:38.094 --> 1:16:39.510
You stay away from me.

1:16:39.554 --> 1:16:40.428
- You're
a manipulative psycho.

1:16:40.471 --> 1:16:41.596
- I will ruin you.

1:16:41.639 --> 1:16:42.972
- This better be the
last time I see you.

1:16:43.016 --> 1:16:44.765
- It's not over til
I say it's over.

1:16:47.729 --> 1:16:49.937
- Oh god, ow.

1:16:54.193 --> 1:16:55.526
Jeff, are you okay?

1:16:55.570 --> 1:16:56.444
- It's okay.

1:16:56.487 --> 1:16:57.778
- You're bleeding, oh my god!

1:16:57.822 --> 1:16:58.904
- Yeah, it hurts.

1:16:58.948 --> 1:17:00.281
- Okay, I'm gonna
call the cops, okay?

1:17:07.999 --> 1:17:09.665
- Yeah, no, it was
definitely Amy.

1:17:10.543 --> 1:17:12.501
- Did you see her?

1:17:12.545 --> 1:17:14.795
Did you see what car she was in?

1:17:14.839 --> 1:17:16.130
- It all happened so fast.

1:17:16.174 --> 1:17:18.341
Honestly, all I could
about was protecting Macy.

1:17:18.384 --> 1:17:20.509
- I'm so glad you guys are okay.

1:17:20.553 --> 1:17:23.512
So, daddy said that
we can't arrest her

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:25.181
based off of a hunch,

1:17:25.224 --> 1:17:26.557
but he's working tirelessly

1:17:26.601 --> 1:17:28.392
to find any evidence
that there is.

1:17:28.436 --> 1:17:29.769
- Thanks, Jordy.

1:17:29.812 --> 1:17:30.686
- Of course.

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.690
Oh, he's gonna have a
cop car parked outside

1:17:34.734 --> 1:17:36.275
until all of this is solved.

1:17:36.319 --> 1:17:37.109
- That's great.

1:17:37.153 --> 1:17:37.902
Thank you.

1:17:37.945 --> 1:17:39.612
- Yeah.

1:17:39.656 --> 1:17:40.988
And I know it goes
without saying,

1:17:41.032 --> 1:17:45.076
but please lock your doors
and use the alarm system.

1:17:45.161 --> 1:17:45.951
- Yeah, we will.

1:17:45.995 --> 1:17:47.078
Thank you.

1:17:47.121 --> 1:17:47.953
- Oh, God.

1:17:47.997 --> 1:17:48.913
I love you guys.

1:17:50.333 --> 1:17:51.165
God.

1:18:02.011 --> 1:18:02.677
Hello?

1:18:04.555 --> 1:18:05.429
- Daddy?

1:18:06.933 --> 1:18:08.391
- Jordy?

1:18:08.434 --> 1:18:10.351
- Why are you answering
Carrie's phone?

1:18:13.773 --> 1:18:15.898
- Yeah, I can take care of that.

1:18:15.942 --> 1:18:17.149
Oh, and I spoke to the school.

1:18:17.193 --> 1:18:18.275
I'm no longer suspended,

1:18:18.319 --> 1:18:20.152
but they said for
everybody's safety,

1:18:20.196 --> 1:18:22.113
I should just stay home
until this gets resolved.

1:18:22.156 --> 1:18:23.489
- Okay.

1:18:23.533 --> 1:18:25.116
Well, Jordy and I are going
to go run some errands

1:18:25.159 --> 1:18:26.742
to finish up the final
arrangements for the wedding.

1:18:26.786 --> 1:18:27.535
- Are you sure?

1:18:27.578 --> 1:18:28.703
- Yes.

1:18:28.746 --> 1:18:30.079
We are not gonna let
Amy destroy our wedding.

1:18:30.123 --> 1:18:31.622
We're gonna go back to plan A

1:18:31.666 --> 1:18:33.332
where Jordy and
I plan everything

1:18:33.376 --> 1:18:34.208
and no wedding planner.

1:18:34.252 --> 1:18:35.584
- All right.

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:36.961
Well, let me know
if you need help.

1:18:37.004 --> 1:18:38.003
- I will.

1:18:38.047 --> 1:18:38.879
Love you.

1:18:38.923 --> 1:18:43.884
- Love you too.

1:18:47.682 --> 1:18:48.556
- Hey.

1:18:51.477 --> 1:18:52.309
What?

1:18:54.772 --> 1:18:58.107
- So, I got some news.

1:19:01.154 --> 1:19:02.486
- Carrie Taylor.

1:19:02.530 --> 1:19:04.447
She have any family
that you know of?

1:19:04.490 --> 1:19:06.741
- No, not that I'm aware of.

1:19:06.784 --> 1:19:10.161
- I had the feeling she
might be on her own.

1:19:10.246 --> 1:19:12.580
- So, what happens now?

1:19:12.623 --> 1:19:13.539
- Well, now that we've ID'd her,

1:19:13.583 --> 1:19:15.583
we'll run a background on her,

1:19:15.626 --> 1:19:17.001
find out all we can.

1:19:17.044 --> 1:19:18.878
And between myself
and forensics,

1:19:18.921 --> 1:19:20.546
we'll know more soon.

1:19:20.590 --> 1:19:21.922
- It's so crazy.

1:19:21.966 --> 1:19:24.759
- Your wedding planner
Amy is our prime suspect.

1:19:24.802 --> 1:19:26.802
We will build a
case against her.

1:19:26.846 --> 1:19:30.097
If or when Carrie wakes up,
she'll be our eye witness.

1:19:30.141 --> 1:19:31.223
Her testimony will be enough

1:19:31.267 --> 1:19:33.100
to put Amy away for
attempted murder.

1:19:34.061 --> 1:19:35.686
- And what about Thomas Mannit?

1:19:35.730 --> 1:19:37.104
- She has an alibi for that.

1:19:37.148 --> 1:19:38.355
Her security company verified

1:19:38.399 --> 1:19:40.608
that they spoke with her
right before the murder.

1:19:43.488 --> 1:19:44.570
That case is still ongoing,

1:19:44.614 --> 1:19:47.531
so if I find out any
other information,

1:19:47.575 --> 1:19:48.532
I'll let you guys know.

1:19:50.411 --> 1:19:51.494
- I'm so sorry, Carrie.

1:19:59.712 --> 1:20:01.045
I'm just so nervous.

1:20:01.088 --> 1:20:02.880
- Oh, that's a good
thing though, right?

1:20:04.008 --> 1:20:04.840
- Yeah.

1:20:04.884 --> 1:20:06.550
I mean, I guess.

1:20:06.636 --> 1:20:08.052
- You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

1:20:08.095 --> 1:20:09.345
- No, no.

1:20:09.388 --> 1:20:12.640
I mean, I know it's a big step,

1:20:12.683 --> 1:20:15.267
but I'm ready to marry Jeff.

1:20:15.311 --> 1:20:18.395
- Oh, you are.

1:20:18.439 --> 1:20:20.356
Oh, by the way, that
is freshly chilled,

1:20:20.399 --> 1:20:23.275
courtesy of your friend Jordy.

1:20:23.319 --> 1:20:24.819
- You are a good friend.

1:20:24.862 --> 1:20:25.778
- Good.

1:20:25.822 --> 1:20:26.821
I'm the best.

1:20:34.247 --> 1:20:36.747
Oh my God, look at you.

1:20:36.791 --> 1:20:38.290
Oh, look at this.

1:20:38.334 --> 1:20:39.542
This won't do.

1:20:39.585 --> 1:20:41.794
I am going to get your
refill while you relax

1:20:41.838 --> 1:20:44.213
and check the ETA
of that limo driver.

1:20:44.257 --> 1:20:45.130
You good here?

1:20:45.174 --> 1:20:46.423
- Yes, I'm good.

1:20:54.851 --> 1:20:55.599
- Where is she, dad?

1:20:55.643 --> 1:20:57.184
Has she called?

1:20:57.270 --> 1:20:59.144
What about Jordy, anything?

1:20:59.188 --> 1:21:00.354
- Nothing.

1:21:00.398 --> 1:21:02.231
I called them both and
nobody's picking up.

1:21:38.936 --> 1:21:39.768
- Coming.

1:22:00.249 --> 1:22:01.665
Hello, come on in.

1:22:04.879 --> 1:22:06.462
- I had a call from
the limo driver

1:22:06.505 --> 1:22:07.963
that said he was headed
over to the house,

1:22:08.007 --> 1:22:09.423
but that was over
30 minutes ago.

1:22:09.467 --> 1:22:11.300
He should be there by now.

1:22:11.344 --> 1:22:12.343
- All right, you know what?

1:22:12.386 --> 1:22:13.594
I'm just gonna head over there.

1:22:13.638 --> 1:22:14.637
Will you hold down the fort?

1:22:14.680 --> 1:22:15.804
- All right.
- I'll be right back.

1:22:15.848 --> 1:22:17.014
- You got it.

1:22:17.058 --> 1:22:18.933
And listen, if they show
up, I'll let you know.

1:22:18.976 --> 1:22:19.767
- Thanks, dad.

1:22:36.285 --> 1:22:37.117
- Doctor?

1:22:38.621 --> 1:22:39.244
Doctor, come in here.

1:22:39.288 --> 1:22:39.995
She's waking up.

1:22:40.039 --> 1:22:41.205
- I'll be right there.

1:22:48.381 --> 1:22:49.213
Relax.

1:22:49.256 --> 1:22:50.297
You're okay.

1:22:50.341 --> 1:22:51.924
Can you tell me your name?

1:22:54.220 --> 1:22:55.260
- Hi, this is Macy.

1:22:55.304 --> 1:22:56.261
Leave a message.

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:57.763
- Macy, where are you?

1:22:57.807 --> 1:22:58.973
We're holding the
wedding for you.

1:22:59.016 --> 1:23:00.557
Please call me and let
me know what's going on.

1:23:00.601 --> 1:23:01.433
Thanks.

1:23:08.693 --> 1:23:11.068
- Jordy, I'm ready to do this.

1:23:21.163 --> 1:23:22.579
- Ready?

1:23:22.623 --> 1:23:24.081
Ready for what?

1:23:24.125 --> 1:23:25.541
There's not going to
be a wedding today.

1:23:27.878 --> 1:23:29.044
- What are you doing here?

1:23:29.088 --> 1:23:31.380
- I know you want him
Macy, but he's mine.

1:23:31.424 --> 1:23:33.590
I've loved him for a lot
longer than you have.

1:23:36.345 --> 1:23:38.929
Sometimes, you have to really
fight for what you want.

1:23:38.973 --> 1:23:41.015
Other times, you
have to kill for it.

1:23:43.436 --> 1:23:44.727
- Like you killed Thomas Mannit.

1:23:44.770 --> 1:23:46.520
- Exactly like Thomas.

1:23:47.898 --> 1:23:48.814
- Jeff.

1:23:48.858 --> 1:23:49.648
Hey, babe.

1:23:49.692 --> 1:23:50.983
- Jeff?

1:24:03.164 --> 1:24:04.079
- Jordy!

1:24:04.123 --> 1:24:05.706
Jordy!

1:24:17.636 --> 1:24:18.802
- It's my wedding.

1:24:24.060 --> 1:24:25.309
- Oh my god, hey.

1:24:25.352 --> 1:24:26.310
You okay?

1:24:33.444 --> 1:24:35.778
- See how you like that?

1:24:35.821 --> 1:24:38.947
Try to ruin my wedding
and take my man.

1:24:40.493 --> 1:24:41.617
Jordy, help me!

1:24:41.660 --> 1:24:43.327
- Go, go, go, go.

1:24:43.370 --> 1:24:44.161
I'm fine.

1:24:44.205 --> 1:24:45.329
- Macy!

1:24:45.372 --> 1:24:46.747
- Jordy!
- Macy, you okay?

1:24:53.297 --> 1:24:54.296
What the hell is going on?

1:24:54.340 --> 1:24:55.631
- It's Amy, she has a gun.

1:24:55.674 --> 1:24:56.423
She just came for me.

1:24:56.467 --> 1:24:57.424
She just tried to kill me.

1:24:57.468 --> 1:24:58.801
- Whoa, whoa, Amy, Amy, stop!

1:24:58.844 --> 1:24:59.635
What are you doing?

1:24:59.678 --> 1:25:00.636
There's no way out for you.

1:25:00.679 --> 1:25:01.887
- What are you talking about?

1:25:01.931 --> 1:25:03.097
There's always a way out.

1:25:03.140 --> 1:25:05.099
They can't touch me.

1:25:05.142 --> 1:25:06.308
There are no witnesses.

1:25:07.353 --> 1:25:09.436
Soon, there won't
be any witnesses.

1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:11.021
- What about Carrie?

1:25:11.065 --> 1:25:12.731
Right, that's one
witness you can't touch.

1:25:12.858 --> 1:25:14.399
- Carrie's dead.

1:25:14.527 --> 1:25:16.276
- No, no, she's at the hospital.

1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:17.361
They found her a
few days ago alive.

1:25:19.281 --> 1:25:19.863
- You're lying.

1:25:19.907 --> 1:25:21.031
- No, she's not.

1:25:21.075 --> 1:25:22.199
In fact, she just
woke up an hour ago.

1:25:22.243 --> 1:25:23.408
She already gave her
statement to the police.

1:25:23.452 --> 1:25:26.036
- Then I better
get this over with.

1:25:41.303 --> 1:25:43.011
- Oh my god.

1:25:43.055 --> 1:25:43.887
Macy!

1:25:56.986 --> 1:25:57.818
- She's coming.

1:25:57.862 --> 1:25:59.278
Take your places.

1:26:08.873 --> 1:26:09.955
- We are gathered here today

1:26:09.999 --> 1:26:14.001
to witness the union
of Jeff and Macy.

1:26:15.504 --> 1:26:20.632
Let the bond of marriage be
strong enough that no one,

1:26:21.719 --> 1:26:23.302
and I mean no one,
can tear it apart.

1:26:24.555 --> 1:26:26.388
Jeff, take your ring,

1:26:26.432 --> 1:26:28.765
put it on Macy's finger
and say your vows.

1:26:31.812 --> 1:26:33.687
- Oh, um, um.

1:26:34.982 --> 1:26:35.856
A-ha.

1:26:40.571 --> 1:26:43.363
- Macy, you are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

1:26:44.408 --> 1:26:45.699
And I promise to love you

1:26:47.036 --> 1:26:49.995
and be faithful to you
for the rest of our lives.

1:26:51.123 --> 1:26:52.915
- Macy, take the ring,

1:26:52.958 --> 1:26:55.292
put it on Jeff's finger
and say your vows.

1:26:59.131 --> 1:27:01.632
- Gee, I never thought
this day would come.

1:27:03.594 --> 1:27:06.178
But, Jeff, I just want you
to know that I love you

1:27:06.222 --> 1:27:10.349
and I will always love you and
be faithful to you forever.

1:27:11.435 --> 1:27:13.268
- By the power vested in me,

1:27:13.312 --> 1:27:16.104
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1:27:16.148 --> 1:27:18.232
Jeff, you may kiss your bride.

1:27:22.238 --> 1:27:23.195
- We did it!
