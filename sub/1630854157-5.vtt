The usual, fellas?

00:37.204 --> 00:38.428
Hey, thanks, Jerome.

00:38.447 --> 00:41.098
Whoa, Jerome,
what's with the wheelchair?

00:41.116 --> 00:43.709
Well, it was date night
with my lady friend.

00:43.786 --> 00:45.693
I put on some Teddy Pendergrass,

00:45.713 --> 00:48.622
one thing led to another,
and we started making love

00:48.698 --> 00:50.440
halfway up the stairs.

00:50.534 --> 00:53.260
Then I lost my footing
and tumbled down half a flight,

00:53.445 --> 00:54.386
buck naked.

00:54.613 --> 00:57.948
Well, this is hardly
dinner conversation.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.391
Who's Teddy Pendergrass?

00:59.618 --> 01:03.136
He's America's number one cause
of urgent lovemaking injuries.

01:03.289 --> 01:06.123
If you're not already in bed
when Teddy starts singing,

01:06.141 --> 01:08.049
somebody's going to the E.R.

01:08.069 --> 01:11.570
Anyway, I busted my knee
really bad,

01:11.721 --> 01:12.979
so here I am.

01:13.056 --> 01:14.965
Aw, geez, that stinks, Jerome.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.149
How long you gonna be
in that chair?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.226
Well, that's the problem.

01:18.395 --> 01:21.080
The doctor said I need surgery
if I'm ever gonna walk again,

01:21.307 --> 01:23.140
but I can't afford it. (sighs)

01:23.233 --> 01:25.158
Man, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.327
I've got to get up
on my feet again.

01:27.479 --> 01:28.662
Relax, it's not so bad.

01:28.814 --> 01:30.589
I bet you're gonna discover
some cool new things

01:30.740 --> 01:32.482
that you couldn't do
when you were walking.

01:32.501 --> 01:35.001
-Like what?
-Well, have you yelled
at someone

01:35.096 --> 01:36.578
for using
the handicapped stall yet?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.823
That stall is for the
differently-abled, you know.

01:39.842 --> 01:42.250
Well, how do you know it's not
a handicapped person in there?

01:42.269 --> 01:44.828
Look, no chair, no crutches.
Whoever's in there

01:44.921 --> 01:47.831
definitely shouldn't be!

01:47.924 --> 01:50.109
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:50.294 --> 01:51.443
Yeah, sure you are.

01:51.670 --> 01:53.170
Hey, you mind flushing
for me, pal?

01:53.188 --> 01:54.338
No arms over here.

01:54.431 --> 01:56.840
Well, I suppose
it's the least I could do.

01:56.859 --> 01:58.692
Oh, my God,
it's bigger than you.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.286
(laughs heartily)

02:04.183 --> 02:05.958
Hey, can you guys
hear me all right?

02:06.127 --> 02:07.609
-Yep.
-Loud and clear.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.794
Fr... in the computer.

02:08.945 --> 02:10.187
What-What'd you,
what'd you say, Cleveland?

02:10.205 --> 02:11.130
-You're cutting in and out.
-Damn it.

02:11.357 --> 02:12.539
It's his crappy
Internet service.

02:12.691 --> 02:14.633
-What does he have?
-He hoarded a decade's worth

02:14.860 --> 02:18.378
of those "100 Free Hours" CDs
AOL would send in the mail.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.197
He's chipping away at 'em
one at a time.

02:20.215 --> 02:22.048
Let me... (glitching)

02:22.201 --> 02:24.384
(echoing): ...other room.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.793
All right,
we'll fill him in later.

02:25.888 --> 02:26.887
Look, we got to help Jerome

02:26.981 --> 02:28.538
pay for that surgery, you guys.

02:28.632 --> 02:30.131
Yeah, but where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.966
Hello? Hello?

02:31.986 --> 02:33.819
Wait, what if we did
some sort of fundraiser?

02:33.970 --> 02:35.762
Donna, unplug everything.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.972
I need the Internet.
No, not tha...

02:37.992 --> 02:39.324
You know,
the local firehouse made

02:39.476 --> 02:40.975
a sexy men in uniform calendar,

02:40.995 --> 02:43.311
and it raised a ton of money.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.997
Don't tell anybody,
but I heard

02:45.224 --> 02:47.482
not all 12 of those guys
were from Quahog.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.893
I-- Who-who would we
tell that to?

02:50.062 --> 02:52.896
I don't know.
I'm just saying... don't.

02:53.065 --> 02:54.398
That's actually not a bad idea.

02:54.416 --> 02:56.341
We already got three
men in uniform.

02:56.493 --> 02:58.235
I'm on the roof now.
Is that bet...

02:58.253 --> 02:59.903
-(bird squawking)
-Bird. Bird.

02:59.996 --> 03:02.639
Bird stole my laptop.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.835
All right, now remember,
we're going for "sexy,"

03:07.855 --> 03:09.246
so can you undo your shirt?

03:09.264 --> 03:10.914
(sighs)

03:10.933 --> 03:12.916
There.

03:12.918 --> 03:15.194
(yawns)

03:15.362 --> 03:16.920
Joe, did you skip your nap?

03:16.939 --> 03:19.031
I don't need a nap!
You need a nap!

03:19.200 --> 03:21.349
I want to be done.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.851
(shaky breathing)

03:23.946 --> 03:26.163
(sobbing)

03:27.599 --> 03:29.875
Wait, Joe, Joe, look.
Look over here.

03:30.102 --> 03:32.602
(sniffling) Who's that?

03:32.696 --> 03:34.213
This is our friend Leapy.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.773
Hey, Joe.
Can you do me a favor?

03:36.866 --> 03:38.942
Okay.

03:38.961 --> 03:40.444
Can you be a big boy

03:40.462 --> 03:42.612
and unbutton your shirt
for the picture?

03:42.631 --> 03:44.640
(sniffles) Yeah.

03:46.876 --> 03:48.618
Great, we're all done.

03:48.787 --> 03:49.877
Now take off your pants.

03:49.897 --> 03:50.562
What the hell?

03:50.714 --> 03:51.788
I said take 'em off.

03:51.881 --> 03:53.974
Joe, don't listen to Leapy.
I was wrong.

03:54.126 --> 03:56.652
Leapy is not our friend.
(grunts)

04:02.484 --> 04:04.451
Yeah, that's good.

04:07.397 --> 04:09.489
Okay, Cleveland,
you're mostly out of shape.

04:09.641 --> 04:13.143
Thankfully, all postmen have
mountain climber leg muscles.

04:13.161 --> 04:14.828
Those will be our focus here.

04:14.997 --> 04:16.630
They really that strong-looking?

04:18.241 --> 04:20.259
It's like
a lady bodybuilder's boob.

04:20.410 --> 04:22.261
I'm disgusted,
but I can't look away.

04:22.488 --> 04:24.137
All right, let's get started.

04:26.249 --> 04:28.183
That's it. Now thigh me.

04:31.830 --> 04:35.232
There we go. Now throw that
bad boy up on the mailbox.

04:37.019 --> 04:38.535
Ah, you're a natural.

04:38.562 --> 04:41.780
You're like Gisele, Beyoncé,
and Naomi Campbell all in one.

04:41.931 --> 04:43.097
You're Gisonmi.

04:43.191 --> 04:45.933
That's it, Gisonmi.
Gisonmi, yes.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.011
-Gisonmi.
-Hey, guys,

04:48.104 --> 04:50.372
I'm just gonna go ahead
and close this, okay?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.293
Getting my house assessed.

05:01.618 --> 05:03.552
(indistinct chatter)

05:05.881 --> 05:08.365
-Here you go, fellas.
-Hey, Jerome.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.957
Great to see you back
on your feet already.

05:10.035 --> 05:12.311
You're telling me.
That calendar of yours

05:12.462 --> 05:14.962
paid for my surgery
and then some.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.391
Consider your tab paid up
for the whole month.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.061
Wow, did we really make
that much money?

05:21.213 --> 05:22.303
Who's buying all these?

05:22.397 --> 05:23.730
Yeah, I figured just our friends

05:23.882 --> 05:24.881
would buy 'em for a laugh.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.141
(laughs)

05:27.161 --> 05:29.995
Oh, yeah, we're having
a laugh, all right.

05:30.222 --> 05:34.291
Might say everybody's having
a ball, right, Mr. Brown?

05:35.485 --> 05:37.419
(laughter)

05:40.265 --> 05:43.324
What's going on here?
Give me that.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.828
All right, let's start
at my navel and work down.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.998
Belt buckled at the third notch,
per postal code regulation.

05:51.093 --> 05:52.517
Shorts securely zipped.

05:52.669 --> 05:54.594
Neatly-pressed crease
running down to--

05:54.688 --> 05:56.521
(gasps) my cocoa pebble!

05:56.748 --> 05:59.006
-Let me see that.
-Oh, yeah, that's a half-scrote

05:59.101 --> 06:01.585
-bad dangle angle right there.
-Oh, no,

06:01.678 --> 06:04.421
the whole town's seen it.
What am I gonna do?

06:04.514 --> 06:05.772
Damn, Mr. Brown.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.758
Larry Bird ought to be
diving through here any second

06:08.777 --> 06:10.369
'cause that's a loose ball.

06:10.596 --> 06:14.097
(laughs) Good job, sweetie.
You're doing the work.

06:14.116 --> 06:15.523
Aw, thanks, Dad.

06:15.692 --> 06:18.460
I learned it all by watching
YouTube videos of Les Dawson.

06:19.529 --> 06:20.995
Who the hell is that?

06:21.106 --> 06:23.940
Uh, 1960s British comic
Les Dawson,

06:23.959 --> 06:25.775
famous for his
mother-in-law jokes?

06:25.869 --> 06:27.719
Geez, Spencer, do the work.

06:39.307 --> 06:41.291
You wanted to see me, sir?

06:41.309 --> 06:43.460
Cleveland,
let me ask you something.

06:43.478 --> 06:45.645
Do you have a problem
with the carrying capacity

06:45.739 --> 06:48.907
of your standard-issue
S-1104 canvas satchel?

06:49.134 --> 06:50.075
No, sir.

06:50.302 --> 06:52.411
I see. So then why, may I ask,

06:52.562 --> 06:56.456
do you feel the need
to carry around an extra sack?!

06:58.085 --> 07:00.919
Sir, y-you don't understand.
It was a mistake.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.328
You're damn right it was.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.423
Your little mistake
has made a complete mockery

07:04.650 --> 07:06.483
of the United States
Postal Service.

07:06.501 --> 07:10.095
This is a noble institution
that runs on dignity.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.580
That's the reason
people trusted us to deliver

07:12.674 --> 07:16.509
free COVID tests several months
after it was relevant.

07:16.662 --> 07:19.162
-But, sir, I...
-No buts, Cleveland.

07:19.164 --> 07:22.165
You've left me no choice.
You're fired.

07:22.334 --> 07:25.502
Now turn in your safari hat
and your ladies' Mace.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.853
This is terrible.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.448

saying goodbye.

I'll buy you lunch.

I have a twinkly phone

09:18.800 --> 09:20.075
It's incredibly festive.

09:20.077 --> 09:21.968
You know, I used
to deliver the mail,

12:52.163 --> 12:54.255
See, back in my mailman days,

by destination.

12:56.926 --> 12:58.851

by invoice

12:59.004 --> 13:00.261
rather than by product type,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.688

out on the road.

-Why'd you do it, Peter?
-(sighs) I'm sorry.

17:42.453 --> 17:44.211
It's just, with you doing
so well at the brewery,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.230
I felt like a joke.

17:46.382 --> 17:48.215
I knew I was never
gonna be a big shot here,

17:48.234 --> 17:51.552
but I liked playing my small
part to help make this beer.

17:51.646 --> 17:54.572
Before you started, that
small part felt like enough.

17:54.723 --> 17:58.134
Griffin, I was just informed
that you tried to sabotage

17:58.152 --> 18:00.578
this operation by putting vermin
in the beer tank.

18:00.729 --> 18:02.914
This is the last straw, Griffin.

18:03.141 --> 18:04.582
You are fired.

18:04.733 --> 18:08.628
Fine. I'm not good enough
for this place anyway.

18:12.575 --> 18:13.257
Wait.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.501
You can't fire Peter, sir.

18:15.653 --> 18:18.429
-And why's that?
-Because you need him.

18:18.581 --> 18:21.248
Sure, companies need some people
to work hard

18:21.267 --> 18:23.750
and go the extra mile,
but more than that,

18:23.845 --> 18:25.252
they need guys like Peter,

18:25.346 --> 18:28.088
regular guys who are happy
to do a thankless job

18:28.108 --> 18:31.258
for a mediocre salary,
day in and day out,

18:31.277 --> 18:33.760
so long as that day ends
with a cold beer

18:33.855 --> 18:36.005
and a best friend
to share it with.

18:36.023 --> 18:37.782
If you fire Peter Griffin,

18:37.859 --> 18:40.009
sir, you fire your customer,

18:40.027 --> 18:41.527
the beer-loving everyman

18:41.679 --> 18:45.014
that makes up the hunched
backbone of this country.

18:45.032 --> 18:47.792
Cleveland, you're right.

18:47.943 --> 18:50.186
Griffin here
is perfectly mediocre,

18:50.204 --> 18:52.964
and America runs on mediocre.

In fact, I'm officially
"terndering" my resignation,

19:42.998 --> 19:46.500
With this rubber band, I will
cinch the offending testicle

19:46.519 --> 19:50.188
so that it can never dangle nor
sway where it does not belong.

19:50.415 --> 19:53.232
(deep breath)
Here I go.

19:54.268 --> 19:56.602
-(grunting)
-(rubber band snaps)

19:56.696 --> 19:58.029
It's done.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.607
Cleveland, we sent your
reinstatement forms a week ago.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.201
I never check my own mail.

20:03.428 --> 20:06.111
You know how Pablo Escobar
never did cocaine?

20:06.264 --> 20:08.431
-He did a lot of cocaine.
-Oh.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.857
Then I fear I've made
a terrible mistake.

20:11.026 --> 20:12.210
Turns out, we couldn't fire you

20:12.361 --> 20:14.787
without running it
by the union head.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.940
Welcome back, Cleveland.
(laughs heartily)

20:18.033 --> 20:20.367
Thank you, sir.
It's good to be back.

20:20.461 --> 20:22.678
-(rubber band snaps)
-(bouncing)

20:24.891 --> 20:27.374
And there goes my ball.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.144
-Here's your rubber band back.
-You-you can keep it.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.218
So, Cleveland, you happy
to be delivering mail again?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.403
Oh, yeah.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.556
Yep, sure is nice
to have things back to normal.

20:42.650 --> 20:44.817
Say, Cleveland, how about
you and me get a quick selfie

20:44.911 --> 20:46.410
to remember this crazy week?

20:46.487 --> 20:48.913
Peter, did you make
another insensitive joke

20:49.140 --> 20:51.082
and need to prove you have
a Black friend again?

20:51.233 --> 20:52.399
I'm not gonna say it was bad,

20:52.493 --> 20:54.977
but I have to make you
my profile picture.

20:54.996 --> 20:56.479
It's my only shot.
Oh, hang on,

20:56.497 --> 20:58.905
there's my Jewish friend
Mort Goldman.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.260
Hey, Mort, what's up, pal?
Quick selfie?
