YOUR FATHER WANTS
A WORD WITH YOU.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.226
IN THE YURT.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.165
IS IT REALLY SO DIFFICULT
TO FIND A GIRL

17:14.166 --> 17:15.733
WHO IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.602
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT
RIGHT FOR YOU.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.037
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S RIGHT FOR,

17:19.039 --> 17:20.738
EXCEPT MAYBE
CLOWN SCHOOL.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.441
SHE'S FRIVOLOUS. YOU TOO ARE
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.143

STICK TOGETHER.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.546
YOU MARK MY WORDS.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.781
SHE IS ENTIRELY
WRONG FOR YOU.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.516
WHAT IF
SHE'S THE ONE, DAD?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.451
WHAT IF I MARRY
THIS GIRL?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.586
DO YOU WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR TAINTING OUR RELATIONSHIP?

17:35.588 --> 17:36.821
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.590
WHAT I WANT IS FOR YOU
TO BE REALISTIC.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.658
BE SERIOUS.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.093
THE ONLY WAY
THIS COULD WORK

17:42.095 --> 17:44.228
IS IF SHE GROWS UP.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.230
AND YOU GOTTA ASK YOURSELF,
IS THAT EVER GONNA HAPPEN?

17:46.232 --> 17:49.333
SHE IS TALKING

I DON'T LIKE TESTS.

AND IT WOULD FIT.
THIS IS AMAZING.

22:38.057 --> 22:42.460

- CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT BREAKUP SEX?
- COULD YOU JUST NOT.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.297
COULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK
ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEX

34:28.300 --> 34:30.634
- FOR THE NEXT 10 SECONDS?
- SURE, I'M DOING IT NOW.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.803
OKAY, WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ABOUT

34:32.804 --> 34:36.206
- INSTEAD OF SEX?
- BUFFALO WINGS.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.541
BUFFALO WINGS?
REALLY, JEFF?

34:37.543 --> 34:39.342
COME ON, CHLOE,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.646
YOU KNOW THE THREE MAJOR
HOLIDAYS ARE BEARING DOWN ON US.

34:42.648 --> 34:44.380
THANKSGIVING,

34:44.382 --> 34:45.614
CHRISTMAS,

34:45.617 --> 34:47.117
NEW YEAR'S.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.652
BREAKING UP
IS TOTALLY GONNA SUCK.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.589
YEAH. IT'S GONNA
BE REALLY AWKWARD.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.324
I DON'T WANNA GO THROUGH THE WHOLE
HOLIDAY SEASON AS A VICTIM.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.793
THIS REALLY SUCKS. I DON'T WANNA
GO THROUGH ALL THAT PITY.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.229
OH, YOU POOR THING.
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:59.231 --> 35:02.799
"THAT IS SO SAD
THAT YOU GUYS BROKE UP.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.135
"I NEVER THOUGHT THAT." I
DON'T WANNA GO THROUGH THAT.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.870
IT'S MY FAVORITE
TIME OF YEAR.

35:06.872 --> 35:10.140
WELL, NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.575
YEAH, I GUESS NOT.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.817
- [PHONE RINGS]
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.886
YEAH, YOU FORGOT
TO SAY GOOD NIGHT.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.488
WE CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.356
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- GOOD NIGHT.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.291
ALL RIGHT,
GOOD NIGHT.

35:34.899 --> 35:37.334
HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SUCCUMB

35:37.336 --> 35:40.704
TO ALL THAT ROMANTIC BULLSHIT
SOCIETY THROWS AT YOU.

35:40.706 --> 35:44.508
ROMANCE, LOVE, MARRIAGE.
IT'S ALL A MYTH.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.243
DOES YOUR HUSBAND KNOW
YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

35:46.245 --> 35:48.211
OH, THE RING?

35:48.213 --> 35:52.249
25 YEARS AGO,
I GOT MARRIED TO MYSELF.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.884
I NEVER HAD A HUSBAND.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.318
I DON'T WANT ONE.
I DON'T NEED ONE.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.287
I'M TOTALLY FULFILLED.

35:57.289 --> 36:00.557
AND PERFECTLY HAPPY
BEING SINGLE.

36:00.559 --> 36:01.858
- YOU ARE?
- YES, VERY.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.860
WHERE DO YOU
FIND THE LOVE?

36:03.862 --> 36:06.396
IT'S ALL AROUND YOU IF YOU
JUST OPEN YOURSELF UP TO IT.

36:06.398 --> 36:09.666
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME TO MY HOUSE
AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA TOMORROW?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.334
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.704
SO, WELCOME
TO MY NIRVANA.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.541
JOINING US FOR TEA
WE'VE GOT BUTTONS,

36:17.543 --> 36:21.511
AND THEN WE HAVE
ORLANDO AND NOODLES,

36:21.513 --> 36:24.614
AND OVER THERE WITH THE
CROOKED TAIL IS JO-JO.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.250
ELEQUINN, HE'S ABOUT
TO BE JOINING US FOR TEA,

36:27.252 --> 36:29.553
AND THAT'S, OF COURSE,
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE.

36:34.725 --> 36:37.561
HOW'S JEFF?
HE IS SO HANDSOME.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.262
HAS A GOOD JOB.

36:39.264 --> 36:40.597
YOU KNOW, I WAS
TALKING TO HIS MOM.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.566
SHE SAID HE IS
VERY RESPONSIBLE.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.267
JUST WHAT YOU NEED...
GROUNDED.

36:44.269 --> 36:45.902
- WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF?
- MOM.

36:45.904 --> 36:49.406
DON'T YOU DARE
LET HIM GET AWAY.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.808
UH, DO YOU THINK
THIS BIRD IS BIG ENOUGH?

36:51.810 --> 36:53.810
UH... SURE.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.513
- UH, JEFF, UM, UH... - OKAY,
I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU

36:56.515 --> 36:58.715
BUT YOUR FATHER AND I
ARE IN COUNSELING.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.585
THE THERAPIST ASKED US WHAT STRENGTHS
HOLD OUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER,

37:01.587 --> 37:03.286
AND WE JUST SAT THERE
LIKE THOSE BIG

37:03.288 --> 37:04.788
EASTER ISLAND HEADS
SAYING NOTHING.

37:04.790 --> 37:05.922
WE COULDN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.924
YOU AND DAD
ARE IN THERAPY?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.693
AND WHEN WE'RE IN CRISIS,
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND

37:09.695 --> 37:11.361
SAFE PLACES TO RETREAT TO.

37:11.363 --> 37:13.863
SO, WE GET INTO A FIGHT,
I COME INTO THE KITCHEN,

37:13.865 --> 37:15.665
YOUR FATHER GOES
IN THE BATHROOM.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.601
HE WAS IN THERE
FOR TWO DAYS.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.436
THEN HE ROSE
LIKE LAZARUS,

37:19.438 --> 37:20.804
AND CLAIMED TO HAVE
A GRAND EPIPHANY

37:20.806 --> 37:22.472
AND HE WON'T TELL ME
WHAT IT IS.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.441
AND HOW IS JEFF?

37:24.443 --> 37:26.810
- HE'S, WELL, HE'S...
- BUTTERNUT SQUASH.

37:26.812 --> 37:29.446
FORGOT THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH.
MOVE IT.

37:32.717 --> 37:36.586
WHEN I SEE THAT LOVELY
GIRL, CHELSEA...

37:36.588 --> 37:38.588
- CHLOE, NANA.
- WHEN I SEE THAT LOVELY GIRL, CHELSEA

37:38.590 --> 37:40.657
AND YOU TOGETHER,

37:40.659 --> 37:46.630
OH, WELL, IT'S THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.965
AND I SEE THE BOTH
OF YOU SO HAPPY

37:48.967 --> 37:51.835
AND I REALIZE
IT'S OKAY NOW,

37:51.837 --> 37:54.337
I CAN DIE IN PEACE.

37:54.339 --> 37:58.675
OH, REMEMBER,
WHEN THE HEART SPEAKS,

37:58.677 --> 38:01.411
LOVE LISTENS.

38:01.413 --> 38:05.515
HERE, ONE IS FOR YOU
AND ONE IS FOR CHELSEA.

38:05.517 --> 38:08.818
OH, I'M SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.887
OH, IF I COULD JUST
LIE DOWN RIGHT NOW

38:10.889 --> 38:12.656
AND DIE,
BUT I WON'T.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.958
I WANNA SEE YOU TWO
TOGETHER FOREVER.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.434
- CHLOE! HI.
- CHLOE.

38:24.436 --> 38:25.602
- KELLY.
- HI.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.604
- BRIAN, HEY.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.306
IT'S SO NICE
TO SEE YOU.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.574
YEAH, IS THAT A RING?
IS THAT NEW?

38:31.576 --> 38:33.943
OH, YEAH.
BRIAN GOT PROMOTED.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.078
- REGIONAL MANAGER.
- YES!

38:35.080 --> 38:37.013
- NO BIG DEAL.
- NO, IT IS.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.515
IT'S A HUGE DEAL. IT'S HUGE.
- IT'S A HUGE DEAL.

38:38.517 --> 38:41.651
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH...

38:41.653 --> 38:43.987
WHERE'S JEFF?

38:43.989 --> 38:45.522
JEFF?

38:45.524 --> 38:47.390
OH, MY GOD,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

38:47.392 --> 38:49.759
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
JEFF AND I ARE FINE.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.061
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

38:51.063 --> 38:52.629
- OH, GOD.
- HONEY, YOU'RE SHAKING.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.931
NO, I KNOW, I JUST...
MY HEART STOPPED.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.833
YOU GUYS ARE JUST SUCH
AN ADORABLE COUPLE

38:56.835 --> 38:58.768
THAT I...
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED

38:58.770 --> 39:01.438
I WOULD BE DEVASTATED.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.406
BUT WE'RE FINE.

39:03.408 --> 39:07.043
SO, WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN?
THANKSGIVING.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.779
- WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. YEAH, YEAH,
YOU'LL SEE ME AT THANKSGIVING.

39:09.781 --> 39:10.847
- ALL RIGHT.
- AWESOME.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.881
ALL RIGHT.
GOBBLE GOBBLE.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.116
YEAH.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.952
TAKE CARE.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.021
JUST RAN INTO KELLY
AND BRIAN.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.358
BRIAN GOT HER A RING. APPARENTLY
THEY CAN AFFORD IT NOW.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.727
"WHERE'S JEFF," SHE ASKED.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.929
SHE LITERALLY SAID,
"OH, MY GOD" TWICE.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.864
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE
LOOK OF TERROR IN HER EYES.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.500
WELL, COUPLES DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN FRIENDS BREAK UP.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.469
IT'S AN ATTACK
ON THE STATUS QUO.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.537
THEY IMMEDIATELY START
QUESTIONING THEY'RE OWN CHOICES.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.805
"WHERE'S JEFF?"

39:35.807 --> 39:37.073
THEY COULDN'T
FATHOM THE FACT

39:37.075 --> 39:38.942
THAT WE WEREN'T ATTACHED
AT THE HIP.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.777
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.946
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT
THROUGH THANKSGIVING.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.782
YEAH, NOT TO MENTION BOTH OUR PARENTS
ARE EXPECTING US TO SHOW FACE.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.785
I DON'T WANT TO BE THE
SAD-EYED PATHETIC SINGLE GIRL.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.957
OH, YEAH. HERE.
IT'S FROM NANA.

39:53.959 --> 39:56.760
- SHE REALLY LIKES YOU.
- I REALLY LIKE HER, TOO.

39:56.762 --> 40:01.398
THIS MAKES ME CRAZY. I'M GOING SUICIDAL
HERE JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.800
WE SHOULD HAVE WAITED
UNTIL AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

40:03.802 --> 40:06.903
- WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?
- NO ONE. YOU?

40:06.905 --> 40:09.506
NOBODY.
NOT YET.

40:09.508 --> 40:14.477
WHAT IF WE JUST WENT
TO THANKSGIVING

40:14.479 --> 40:16.813
AS A COUPLE AND PRETENDED
WE DIDN'T BREAK UP?

40:16.815 --> 40:21.084
YOU KNOW, I'M IMPRESSED.
WHAT AN INCREDIBLY DUMB IDEA.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.119
NO, THAT SOUNDS
PROBLEMATIC AND AWKWARD,

40:23.121 --> 40:25.021
NOT TO MENTION
EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.423
- REALLY? MORE AWKWARD... - YES.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.091
THAN STAYING HOME ALONE
OR GOING OUT

40:28.093 --> 40:29.659
AND SUFFERING THROUGH
THE PITY PARTIES?

40:29.661 --> 40:31.428
BEING CONSTANTLY
CONSOLED AND CODDLED

40:31.430 --> 40:33.663
OVER OUR TRAGIC LOSS?

40:33.665 --> 40:36.966
OKAY, SO, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS WE STAY TOGETHER

40:36.968 --> 40:39.536
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE BROKEN UP
IN ORDER TO AVOID

40:39.538 --> 40:41.004
THE BITTER ANGUISH
OF SOLITUDE,

40:41.006 --> 40:42.906
OR ALL THE WELL-MEANING,
BUT SOUL CRUSHING SYMPATHY?

40:42.908 --> 40:44.073
WE CAN DO IT.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.042
MAKE IT FUN.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.877
FOR YOU.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.682
SO I ASSUME I'LL HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH HOURS

40:52.684 --> 40:55.518
OF YOUR CHILDISH
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR?

40:55.520 --> 40:57.720
AS I WILL HAVE TO SMILE
DELIGHTFULLY AS YOU CONTINUE

40:57.722 --> 40:59.088
YOUR PESSIMISTIC
MARCH INTO MIDDLE AGE.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.090
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.625
NO SLIPS OF THE TONGUE.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.561
NO INAPPROPRIATE
TOURETTE'S BLURTING.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.796
BLURTING IS
HENCEFORTH BANISHED.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.765
- DEAL?
- DEAL.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.166
- SEAL IT WITH BREAKUP SEX?
- NO.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.868
- COME ON.
- NOT. NEIN.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.670
WE GOTTA SEAL THE DEAL.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.705
CAPTAIN WINKIE'S GONNA
HAVE TO FIND A NEW OUTLET.

41:15.707 --> 41:16.973
HAVE YOU TRIED
A LAMP SOCKET?

41:16.975 --> 41:19.676
CAN WE AT LEAST HUG?

41:19.678 --> 41:21.911
COME HERE.
BRING IT IN.

41:21.913 --> 41:22.979
OH, YEAH.

41:32.823 --> 41:33.923
- HEY.
- HEY.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.058
WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

41:35.060 --> 41:36.659
I WAS GOING
FOR THE CHEEK.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.261
- OKAY, TAKE THE CHEEK.
- WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU?

41:38.263 --> 41:40.663
IT WAS AMAZING.
CAN WE GO IN NOW?

41:40.665 --> 41:42.065
YEAH, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT WAS LATE, AGAIN,

41:42.067 --> 41:43.933
- AS USUAL, SUNSHINE.
- OKAY, FOR THE RECORD,

41:43.935 --> 41:46.169
AND THIS GOES ON YOUR
PERMANENT RECORD, BY THE WAY,

41:46.171 --> 41:49.639
YOU'RE TOO PUNCTUAL. IT COMES
OFF STODGY AND DESPERATE.

41:49.641 --> 41:51.508
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
GO IN WITHOUT ME?

41:51.510 --> 41:53.276
WELL, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO IN ALONE.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.944
I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE SHOULD GO IN TOGETHER,

41:54.946 --> 41:57.947
- YOU KNOW, AS A COUPLE.
- RIGHT.

41:57.949 --> 42:02.685
NOT JUST ANY COUPLE, BUT THE PERFECT
COUPLE THAT'S MADLY IN LOVE.

42:02.687 --> 42:07.790
OKAY. OH, THE OLD SPICE
IS DRIVING ME WILD.

42:16.901 --> 42:18.968
- MOM!
- WELL, HI, SWEETIE.

42:18.970 --> 42:22.038
YOU REMEMBER TERRIFICALLY
HANDSOME, WONDERFUL JEFF.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.807
OH, OF COURSE I DO. I'M NOT GOING TO
FORGET THE MAN YOU'RE LIVING WITH.

42:24.809 --> 42:27.210
BY THE WAY, SWEETIE,

42:35.320 --> 42:37.954
HEY, GUY,

42:39.758 --> 42:41.658

42:41.660 --> 42:43.560

42:46.164 --> 42:48.665
MOVING IN

42:48.667 --> 42:53.636
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LIVING
WITH THE BUDDHISTS IN ARIZONA,

42:53.638 --> 42:57.040
RANDY, COULD YOU, SWEETIE, COULD
YOU PLEASE GO CHECK ON CONNOR?

42:57.042 --> 42:58.308

42:58.310 --> 43:00.310
- HI, KIDDIES..
- HI.

43:00.312 --> 43:04.080
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAMILY.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.050
AND I... I AM
JUST SO THANKFUL

43:07.052 --> 43:10.587
THAT CHLOE AND JEFF
HAVE FOUND EACH OTHER,

43:10.589 --> 43:14.223
AND I HOPE AND I PRAY THAT
THEIR LOVING RELATIONSHIP

43:14.225 --> 43:17.860
CONTINUES TO BLOSSOM AND...

43:17.862 --> 43:19.662
THERE'S FRUIT IN THE FORM
OF A GRANDCHILD.

43:19.664 --> 43:21.631
OH, GOD, MOM.

43:21.633 --> 43:24.934
- CHEERS. - ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY, LET'S DRINK TO THAT.

43:24.936 --> 43:26.235
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT STRETCH MARKS?

43:26.237 --> 43:27.737
DON'T BE WORRIED
ABOUT THEM.

43:27.739 --> 43:31.140
I HEARD THAT YOU TWO
MOVED IN TOGETHER?

43:31.142 --> 43:33.309
- YEAH.
- YEAH, WE DID.

43:33.311 --> 43:36.112
AND I'M NOTICING ALL THESE
BEAUTIFUL LITTLE QUIRKS ABOUT HIM.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.815
HE SNORES LIKE
A BABY GOAT.

43:38.817 --> 43:41.884
AND WHO KNEW
HE WAS A BED WETTER.

43:41.886 --> 43:44.354
- BUT THAT'S LOVE, RIGHT?
- IT SURE IS.

43:44.356 --> 43:46.289
SO WHERE IS
THIS LOVE NEST?

43:46.291 --> 43:48.691
ON PICO.

43:48.693 --> 43:51.160
PICO? AND WHERE ON PICO?

43:51.162 --> 43:55.231
IT'S ON PICO AND CLAM.

43:55.233 --> 43:58.101
I DON'T... WHERE'S...
WHERE IS THAT?

43:58.103 --> 44:00.103
IT'S... I MEAN, IT'S ON PICO.
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

44:00.105 --> 44:02.839
KELLY, IT'S THERE.

44:02.841 --> 44:04.941
SO HOW'S IT GOIN'?

44:04.943 --> 44:07.944
I MEAN, ARE YOU... ARE YOU GUYS
STILL HOT FOR EACH OTHER?

44:07.946 --> 44:10.079
YES, OH, MY GOD.
WE ARE SO HOT.

44:10.081 --> 44:12.782
I MEAN, WE ARE LIKE ANIMALS.
LIKE, WOW.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.017
SHE IS AN ANIMAL.

44:14.019 --> 44:15.885
I MEAN, I CAN'T
KEEP HER OFF ME.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.287
I'M LIKE ENOUGH ALREADY.
I'M LIKE HURTING IT.

44:18.289 --> 44:20.289
I COULD USE ANOTHER
GLASS OF WHITE WINE.

44:20.291 --> 44:21.691
JEFF?

44:24.828 --> 44:26.162
CUT THE BULLSHIT.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.430
SERIOUSLY.

44:27.432 --> 44:29.932
- GIRL TO GIRL.
- OH, GIRL TO GIRL.

44:29.934 --> 44:31.167
WELL, IF WE'RE DOING
GIRL TO GIRL

44:31.169 --> 44:33.302
THEN I SWEAR
ON MY SACRED CHA-CHA

44:33.304 --> 44:34.971
THAT JEFF AND I
ARE SOUL MATES.

44:34.973 --> 44:37.674
WHEN HE'S NOT AROUND,
I'M A TRAIN WRECK.

44:37.676 --> 44:39.075
OKAY, COME ON.

44:39.077 --> 44:40.910
I'M NOT DUMB.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.012
I'VE GOT BRAINS
AND INTUITION.

44:43.014 --> 44:46.215
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS, JEFFY.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.884
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

44:49.219 --> 44:50.953
JEFFY?

44:50.955 --> 44:52.789
WAS SHE FLIRTING WITH YOU?
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO HER?

44:52.791 --> 44:54.691
NO. NO. KELLY?

44:54.693 --> 44:57.794
[CHUCKLES]
THAT'S... THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

44:57.796 --> 45:01.030
SHE DOES HAVE AN APPEAL
IN A HOEY SORT OF WAY.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.331
MEN LIKE THAT, DON'T THEY?
THEY LIKE HOS.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.400
NO, MEN DON'T LIKE HOS.
THEY LOVE HOS.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.369
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT AM I DOING?

45:06.371 --> 45:09.472
- YOU CAN LET GO NOW.
- NO, HEY, WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS SUSPICIOUS?

45:09.474 --> 45:11.974
NO ONE'S GONNA... JUST GET...
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

45:11.976 --> 45:14.243
JUST LET ME HOLD YOU. HEY.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.813
- DID YOU SHAVE YOUR LEGS?
- DID YOU SMELL ME?

45:16.815 --> 45:19.716
NOPE, NOPE. I DID NOT SHAVE MY LEGS.
I'M GOING FULL MAMMAL.

45:19.718 --> 45:21.317
JANE GOODALL'S
FOLLOWING ME.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.219
- YES, THAT'S SO HOT.
- YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.821
IF YOU DON'T LET... FINE...

45:26.256 --> 45:28.257
SOMETIMES IT DOES GET
A LITTLE OLD THOUGH.

45:28.259 --> 45:31.761
LIKE I WISH THAT RANDY WOULD
ACTUALLY TAKE ON A LOVER

45:31.763 --> 45:35.064
SO HE WOULD QUIT BOTHERING ME
TO TAKE CARE OF HIS NEEDS.

45:35.066 --> 45:38.034
THE ONLY TIME MANDY AND I
HAVE SEX IN THE SAME ROOM

45:38.036 --> 45:40.236
IS WHEN SHE WALKS IN
ON ME MASTURBATING.

45:44.007 --> 45:47.443
AND SHE USED TO WEAR
THESE PANTIES, YOU KNOW,

45:47.445 --> 45:50.046
LIKE A NICE THONG.

45:50.048 --> 45:54.817
BUT NOW IT'S JUST
THESE GIANT...

45:54.819 --> 45:57.420
YOU KNOW, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE
A... LIKE... LIKE A PARACHUTE...

45:57.422 --> 45:59.989
LIKE A PARACHUTE
KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW.

45:59.991 --> 46:02.091
LOOKS LIKE SHE'S IN
A BREAK DANCING MOVIE.

46:02.093 --> 46:05.495
YOU KNOW, HE'S LIKE A REAL
HORNY ORANGUTAN ALL THE TIME.

46:05.497 --> 46:07.897
WOW, HOW OFTEN
ARE YOU GUYS...

46:07.899 --> 46:11.501
- AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH.
- IT'S SO EXHAUSTING.

46:11.503 --> 46:13.870
- THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH.
- THAT IS A LOT.

46:13.872 --> 46:16.239
AND I HAVE THESE FANTASIES.

46:16.241 --> 46:17.840
WELL, THAT'S NORMAL.

46:17.842 --> 46:19.342
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T
LIKE A GOOD FANTASY?

46:19.344 --> 46:24.080
I GO IN THE KITCHEN
AND I GRAB A CAST IRON SKILLET

46:24.082 --> 46:28.417
AND I... I HIT HER
OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.

46:30.087 --> 46:34.557
YEAH. AND THEN I STAND
ABOVE THE BODY...

46:36.493 --> 46:39.061
AND SHE'S NOT DEAD,

46:39.063 --> 46:41.464
BUT I STAND ABOVE
THE BODY...

46:46.203 --> 46:50.439
AND I BASK
IN THE SILENCE.

46:50.441 --> 46:51.474
[MANDY]
RANDY!

46:51.476 --> 46:57.146
[BABY WHIMPERING]

46:57.148 --> 46:58.948
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

46:58.950 --> 47:00.383
I'M GONNA GO
PICK UP HER.

47:00.385 --> 47:03.386
NO, LET HER CRY. THEY NEED
TO CRY THEMSELVES OUT.

47:03.388 --> 47:05.054
YOU NEVER LET
CHLOE CRY,

47:05.056 --> 47:07.089
NOW IMAGINE IF YOU HAD
SHE'S BE DIFFERENT.

47:07.091 --> 47:09.125
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.027
- [BABY CRYING]
- IT'S OKAY. SHH.

47:11.029 --> 47:12.862
DON'T LISTEN
TO FRAULEIN HITLER.

47:12.864 --> 47:15.097
GRANDPA'S HERE,
OKAY, BABY?

47:19.269 --> 47:21.103
WHAT'S GOING ON?

47:21.105 --> 47:23.873
SAME THING THAT'S BEEN
GOING ON FOR 25 YEARS.

47:23.875 --> 47:26.275
YOUR FATHER AND I JUST HAVE VERY
DIFFERENT CONCEPTS OF CHILD REARING.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.110
I KNOW.

47:28.112 --> 47:29.879
REMEMBER THE TIME
YOU TOOK AWAY ALL MY TOYS?

47:29.881 --> 47:32.081
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, CHLOE,
DON'T START ON ME TODAY.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.984
I WAS SIX. YOU YELLED AT ME AND
TOLD ME TO CLEAN UP MY ROOM.

47:34.986 --> 47:38.221
I DID, BUT THE TOYS WANTED
TO STAY OUT AND PLAY.

47:38.223 --> 47:41.023
SO EVEN THOUGH I PUT THEM
BACK IN THE TOY BOX,

47:41.025 --> 47:42.859
THEY WOULDN'T STAY IN.
THEY CAME OUT

47:42.861 --> 47:44.994
ALL BY THEMSELVES
TO PLAY.

47:44.996 --> 47:48.064
NOW I REMEMBER, YOU MADE UP
THAT RIDICULOUS STORY

47:48.066 --> 47:49.599
AND YOU WOULDN'T
LET IT GO.

47:49.601 --> 47:52.101
I WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE,
AND YOU WOULDN'T.

47:52.103 --> 47:53.569
HONEY, TOYS DON'T
CLIMB OUT

47:53.571 --> 47:55.571
OF A TOY BOX BY THEMSELVES,
FOR GOD SAKES.

47:55.573 --> 47:58.641
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE YOU.
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BELIEVE ME,

47:58.643 --> 48:00.610
I WANTED YOU
TO BELIEVE WITH ME.

48:00.612 --> 48:02.311
I THOUGHT THAT IF
YOU COULD DO THAT,

48:02.313 --> 48:04.480
THEN SO MANY OTHER THINGS
COULD BE POSSIBLE.

48:04.482 --> 48:07.450
BUT YOU WOULDN'T EVEN JUST PRETEND.
YOU JUST TOOK AWAY MY TOYS.

48:07.452 --> 48:11.420
- JUST FOR ONE DAY. YOU NEEDED TO LEARN.
- OR MAYBE YOU DID.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.659
WHAT WAS DAD'S
BATHROOM EPIPHANY?

48:16.661 --> 48:20.162
SHE'S SLEEPING NOW.

48:20.164 --> 48:24.600
YOU KNOW, AMAZING THINGS CAN
HAPPEN TO YOU IN THE BATHROOM.

48:24.602 --> 48:28.237
LET ME TELL YOU, PRINCESS,
I REMEMBERED SPINNING

48:28.239 --> 48:32.141
YET ANOTHER FANTASTIC YARN
ABOUT INNOCENCE

48:32.143 --> 48:37.013
OF YET ANOTHER ONE OF MY GUILTY
REPREHENSIVE, UNREMORSEFUL CLIENTS,

48:37.015 --> 48:39.649
AND I SPUN THIS WILD
FABRICATION.

48:39.651 --> 48:44.387
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I
HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS.

48:44.389 --> 48:46.589
CREATING ALTERNATE
REALITIES.

48:46.591 --> 48:48.925
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

48:48.927 --> 48:52.995
WHY CAN'T I DO THAT
FOR MY OWN LIFE?

48:52.997 --> 48:55.231
LET'S JUST CUT TO THE CHASE
AND CONFESS TO YOUR DAUGHTER

48:55.233 --> 48:58.301
THAT YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND...
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.

48:58.303 --> 49:01.003
YOUR FATHER HAS
THIS ALTER EGO, LARRY,

49:01.005 --> 49:03.039
THAT YOU DON'T
NEED A "LAWYER" LAWYER.

49:03.041 --> 49:06.142
- HE'S SHOOTING THESE UTTERLY
USELESS VIDEOS. - TOTALLY USEFUL.

49:06.144 --> 49:07.543
SO USELESS THERE
ARE NO WORDS,

49:07.545 --> 49:09.278
AND HE'S POSTING THEM
ON YOUTUBE.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.248
PEOPLE SPEND THEIR HARD-EARNED
MONEY ON ATTORNEYS.

49:12.250 --> 49:15.318
- IT'S A DISGRACE.
- NOBODY SEES THESE.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.687
MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE.
IT'S PATHETIC.

49:17.689 --> 49:21.324
OH, VISIONARIES ARE RARELY
RECOGNIZED IN THEIR OWN TIME.

49:21.326 --> 49:22.992
MOM, IF IT MAKES HIM HAPPY.

49:22.994 --> 49:24.427
HE'S IGNORING HIS PRACTICE.

49:24.429 --> 49:26.362
HE DOES NOTHING BUT SHOOT
THESE INANE VIDEOS.

49:26.364 --> 49:28.531
ESSENTIALLY, HE'S TRYING TO
PUT HIMSELF OUT OF BUSINESS.

49:28.533 --> 49:31.167
SHE'S EXAGGERATING. IT WAS ALWAYS
HER SECOND BEST ORAL TALENT.

49:31.169 --> 49:34.403
OH, THANK YOU, DEAR. I GUESS A
TAKE AWAY FROM ALL THIS, CHLOE,

49:34.405 --> 49:36.639
IS YOU DON'T LET THINGS BUILD
UP BETWEEN YOU AND JEFF.

49:36.641 --> 49:39.742
BE HONEST.
LET YOUR FEELINGS OUT.

49:39.744 --> 49:41.677
I REALLY LIKE JEFF.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.612
- I THINK HE'S GREAT.
- HMM.

49:43.614 --> 49:46.215
- YOU GOT THOSE PIES FROM GLEASON'S, RIGHT?
- YES.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.616
THEY HAVE TO BE
FROM GLEASON'S.

49:47.618 --> 49:49.352
HE'S CRAZY
ABOUT THE PUMPKIN PIE.

49:55.392 --> 49:57.360
THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE
NOT LISTENING TO ME.

49:57.362 --> 50:00.596
NO, THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYTHING
YOU SAY IS TOTAL BULLSHIT.

50:08.739 --> 50:10.539
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY ARE YOU SO SO SNEAKY.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.707
ARE WE VISITING
OR ROBBING THIS PLACE?

50:11.709 --> 50:13.409
NO, NO, WE'LL GO
IN THE BACK,

50:13.411 --> 50:15.511
WE WON'T HAVE TO MAKE
SOME BIG PHONY ENTRANCE.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.413
[MAN] WE'RE JUST HAVING A CONVERSATION.
WHY ARE YOU OVERREACTING?

50:17.415 --> 50:19.515
[WOMAN] I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D HEAR THOSE WORDS

50:19.517 --> 50:21.617
- COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.
- YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING MY INTENTIONS.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.519
NO, YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF
VERY CLEAR.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.088
YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL ME
AND IT'S WORKING.

50:26.090 --> 50:27.523
I THINK I'M HAVING
AN ANEURISM.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.625
- WHAT DO WE DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

50:29.627 --> 50:33.062
- OKAY.
- NO, WE'LL GO THIS WAY. THEY MIGHT SEE US.

50:34.097 --> 50:37.166
HI, MAMA.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.734
- JEFFY!
- HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.736
OH, HONEY, THANK YOU.

50:40.738 --> 50:45.107
CHLOE.
OH, YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

50:45.109 --> 50:48.778
THANK YOU, SO DO YOU. YOU
HAVE A VERY HEALTHY GLOW.

50:48.780 --> 50:52.782
OH, SWEET. GLEASON'S.

50:52.784 --> 50:55.217
- ARE THOSE PUMPKIN PIES?
- MAYBE.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.153
OH, I'M GONNA GO
TAKE THEM OVER HERE.

51:02.325 --> 51:05.161
SO HOW DO YOU TWO LOVE BIRDS
LIKE NESTING TOGETHER?

51:05.163 --> 51:08.164
OH, THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF

51:08.166 --> 51:09.765
AND THEY START TO GET
ON YOUR NERVES.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.434
OH, SHE'S NOT GETTING
ON MY NERVES.

51:11.436 --> 51:13.836
IN FACT, SHE'S GONE
SO MUCH OF THE TIME,

51:13.838 --> 51:16.439
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
SHE'S THERE.

51:16.441 --> 51:21.544
- I REALLY MISS HER.
- OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

51:21.546 --> 51:23.646
YOU KNOW, YOUR GRANDFATHER,
BERNHARD AND I,

51:23.648 --> 51:25.347
USED TO BE LIKE THAT.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.450
UNTIL HE MET THAT
GUATEMALAN WHORE

51:27.452 --> 51:31.087
AND MOVED TO NEW YORK.

51:31.089 --> 51:35.825
AND THEN, WELL, HAD A HEART
ATTACK, LIKE HE SHOULD.

51:35.827 --> 51:38.561
- WHAT?
- YES.

51:38.563 --> 51:41.130
WHO WANTS GLEASON'S
PUMPKIN PIE?

51:41.132 --> 51:42.698
OVER HERE.
BRING IT ON.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.868
- FROM GLEASON'S.
- OH, I LOVE THAT STORE.

51:45.870 --> 51:48.471
- FRESH.
- OH, LOOK AT THAT.

52:03.687 --> 52:07.423
GIVE ME
THE WHIPPED CREAM.

52:07.425 --> 52:09.625
THANKS.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.393
YEAH, THERE WE GO.

52:19.202 --> 52:22.404
I KNEW IT. THESE PIES
AREN'T FROM GLEASON'S.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.340
THEY'RE FROM
DOLLAR BARN.

52:29.613 --> 52:31.347
[SIGHS]

52:31.349 --> 52:34.250
YOU FORGED PIES? YOU
ACTUALLY BROUGHT COUNTERFEIT

52:34.252 --> 52:36.418
- GLEASON PUMPKIN PIES?
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THEY CHARGE

52:36.420 --> 52:40.656
- FOR THOSE STUPID GLEASON'S PIES?
- YES.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.258
I LOST MY JOB.

52:47.230 --> 52:49.732
WHAT?
LIKE, HOW?

52:49.734 --> 52:51.467
I'D RATHER NOT SAY.

52:51.469 --> 52:54.570
WELL, I'D RATHER YOU
NOT NOT SAY.

52:54.572 --> 52:57.173
I'D RATHER YOU SAY SAY.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.341
OKAY. YOU KNOW FRANK?

52:59.343 --> 53:01.377
YEAH, THE OLD GUY
WHO WORKS IN THE STOCK ROOM?

53:01.379 --> 53:03.512
YEAH, WELL, MY MANAGER
TOOK HER LUNCH BREAK

53:03.514 --> 53:05.681
AND HE DECIDED TO LAY DOWN,
AND, YOU KNOW,

53:05.683 --> 53:09.618
HE WORKS TWO JOBS,
AND HE FELL ASLEEP.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.320
AND?

53:11.322 --> 53:13.289
AND HE LOOKED COLD
SO I LET HIM SLEEP

53:13.291 --> 53:17.693
AND I PUT A BLANKET
OVER HIM.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.795
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

53:19.797 --> 53:21.864
- VIDEO SURVEILLANCE.
- OH.

53:21.866 --> 53:24.266
BIG SISTER
WAS WATCHING.

53:24.268 --> 53:26.468
- OH, WOW. THAT SUCKS. - YEAH.

53:26.470 --> 53:27.670
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO NOW?

53:27.672 --> 53:29.838
THEY TOOK AWAY
ALL OF YOUR TOYS?

53:29.840 --> 53:31.840
I BET YOU HATED
BEING A KID.

53:31.842 --> 53:33.209
I LOVED BEING A KID.

53:33.211 --> 53:36.312
UNTIL MY 12TH BIRTHDAY.

53:36.314 --> 53:38.747

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:42.050
- WELL, WHAT... SHE GAVE US CASH.
- I SAW THAT.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.385
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE ROBBED A BANK.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:45.520
LET'S JUST...
WE'LL TELL HER NOW.

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:47.088
- YOUR MOM'S COMING. LET'S TELL HER NOW.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:48.423
- HI.
- HI, MOM.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.358
- OH, MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.160

- LISTEN TO ME.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:59.901
WE HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:01.369
OH, WHAT'S THIS?

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:04.439
- THIS IS THE KEY TO OUR FAMILY.
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.908
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I KNOW THAT CLARK

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.010
HAS A WAY OF LOCKING
PEOPLE OUT,

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.912
BUT HE PICKED
THIS OUT ESPECIALLY, SO...

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.314
LOOK.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.383
- WOW, THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:19.521
NOW, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN DO WE
GET TO SEE THE LITTLE LOVE NEST?

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:22.057

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:31.166
OH, YOU HAVE A NEW JOB?
HOW WONDERFUL.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:34.436

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.071
WORKING WITH KIDS.
KINDERGARTEN.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.106
YUP, IT'S A PERFECT
FIT FOR HER.

01:04:38.108 --> 01:04:40.075
SHE'S ACTUALLY ENROLLED.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:43.245
JEFF, STOP THAT.
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE TEACHING?

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.480
NO, I'M ACTUALLY
A TEACHER'S ASSISTANT.

01:04:45.482 --> 01:04:48.049
BUT I AM GOING TO SCHOOL
FOR A TEACHING DEGREE.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.418
WELL, YOU MUST
BE SO PROUD.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.922
YOU DO HAVE THAT SHEEN OF
ACCOMPLISHMENT ABOUT YOU, DON'T YOU?

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:56.191
- OH.
- THANK YOU.

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.093
GIVE ME A MINUTE,
I GOTTA GO TALK TO DAD.

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:00.629
YEAH.

01:05:00.631 --> 01:05:02.964
I CAN'T KEEP THIS.
I FEEL WAY TOO GUILTY.

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.533
YEAH, SO MUCH FOR THE HONESTY
AND INTEGRITY THING, RIGHT?

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.269
YOU DIDN'T JUMP IN.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:09.104
[SIGHS]
WHATEVER.

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:10.538
THE KINDERGARTEN
TEACHING THING,

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.407
THAT WAS A SMOOTH MOVE.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.476
JUST SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT FOR A WHILE.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:15.977
- YEAH? - OH, GREAT. INCOMING.

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.579
- HEY.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.181
SO WHAT'S UP... WHAT'S UP
WITH EBENEZER BACK THERE?

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:25.420
OH, YOUR FATHER, HE'S BEEN
IN SUCH A FOUL MOOD.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.656
WELL, YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE
TALKED ABOUT AT THANKSGIVING?

01:05:27.658 --> 01:05:29.157
- YEAH.
- REMEMBER THAT?

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.259
- NO.
- WHAT?

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.395
OH, CERTAINLY
YOU TOLD CHLOE.

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:35.163
JEFF'S NOT MUCH OF A SHARER.

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:36.965
BOYS.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:39.668
ALL RIGHT, SO JEFF'S FATHER
WAS GOING ON AND ON

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.037
ABOUT AN OPEN MARRIAGE,

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:44.973
AND, WELL, NATURALLY,
I WAS... I WAS CRUSHED,

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:47.208
BUT, I GAVE IN,

01:05:47.210 --> 01:05:51.413
AND THERE'S THIS YOUNG MAN
AT THE CLUB, FERNANDO,

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:53.415
THE TENNIS PRO,

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:56.718
AND HE'S SUCH A... HE'S SUCH
A LARGE MAN, YOU KNOW?

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:59.054
AND, WELL, FRANKLY,
I HAD FORGOTTEN

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:01.323
HOW INCREDIBLY
INTENSE SEX COULD BE.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:05.226
IT'S LIKE BIKRAM YOGA. I'VE NEVER
SWEAT SO MUCH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.362
MOM, PLEASE.
I'M BEGGING YOU,

01:06:07.364 --> 01:06:08.997
- DON'T FINISH THAT SENTENCE.
- OH, POOH.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:12.600
- I'M GONNA GO SEE MY PARENTS.
- OKAY.

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:16.671
IT'S REALLY SORT OF DYNAMIC
FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:19.507
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE
TELLING ME THIS ON CHRISTMAS?

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:22.043
- I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED A DANCER.
- BECAUSE YOU PROMISED ME.

01:06:22.045 --> 01:06:23.111
- YOU SAID IT WAS THE ONE THING...
- HEY.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.446
- HEY.
- OH, HI, HONEY.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.748

WHEN I'M AROUND
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS

AND I TEND
TO JIBBER JABBER

I... WHEN I WAS A KID
I PUT MY TOES IN MY MOUTH

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.245
AND I WOULD
SUCK ON... SHIT.

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:32.047
YOU USED TO SUCK
ON SHIT?

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.782
MY TOES, NOT SHIT.

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:37.485
I'M SORRY, IT WAS GOOD
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:39.721
OH, NO, DON'T GO.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:42.290

AND BEING HONEST.
IT'S NICE.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:48.363
SO THE SCARY TOE-SUCKING GUY
DIDN'T SCARE YOU AWAY?

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.765
NOT IF YOU KEEP
YOUR SHOES ON.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:53.368
SO, YOU CAME WITH KELLY?

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:54.636
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME ALONE.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.137
BRIAN DUMPED HER.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:57.739
- OH.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.174
ESPECIALLY RIGHT
BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS.

- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WHAT WAS WHAT?

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:14.649
SHE WAS PRACTICALLY
DRY HUMPING YOU.

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:16.618
AND THAT WOULD
BOTHER YOU BECAUSE...?

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.752
YOU ARE... NOT MY PROBLEM MAKING
A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:19.787
GO AHEAD.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.356
HUMP AWAY.

[KELLY] WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH YOU TWO?

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.710
I MEAN, REALLY?

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:46.581
I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU KEEP
BANGING THAT DRUM, KELLY.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.683
- JEFF AND I ARE FINE.
- RIGHT.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.952
SO, THAT'S WHY HE'S BEEN
SITTING OVER THERE

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.188
WAITING UNDER THE MISTLETOE FOR
SOMEONE TO SUCK HIS LIPS OFF?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.457
OH, HE'S FINE.
HE'S A LONE WOLF.

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:59.260
NO, WHAT? FINE, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DO IT, THEN I WILL.

01:09:59.262 --> 01:10:02.230
NO, OKAY, GOD, COULD
YOU BE MORE ANNOYING?

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:18.413
YOU HAVEN'T KISSED ME
LIKE THAT IN FOREVER.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.515
I WAS MERELY PRESERVING
THE FACADE.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:22.483
IT WAS AN ACT
FOR DETECTIVE KELLY.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:23.918
YOU LIKED THIS KISS,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.920
EH.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:29.824
IT WAS A PERFECTLY
APPROPRIATE KISS

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:32.427
BETWEEN TWO
INCOMPATIBLE ADULTS.

01:10:32.429 --> 01:10:36.531
IT'S ALL MY TRAGICALLY THIN,
LITTLE LIPS HAVE TO OFFER.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:42.370
WELL, I THINK YOUR LIPS
ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER MET.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.707
REALLY?

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:50.645
I SWEAR TO GOD.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:52.413
I FELT LIKE THIS STIRRING IN MY LOINS.
YOU WANNA FEEL IT?

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:54.415
AH, THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
BUT NO THANKS.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:56.684
YOU CAN TELL YOUR LOINS
TO FORGET IT.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.486
I'M GONNA TURN
THE OTHER WAY NOW.

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.560
[JEFF]
YOU GO FIRST.

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.367
A JUGGLING KIT?
YOU BRAT.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.840
"BUILDING YOUR DREAM HOUSE."

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:25.046
THIS IS, UH,
SO GROWN UP OF YOU.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:28.683
I WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING SILLY.

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.318
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.552
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.821
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR HEARTBREAK

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:37.325
AND I PRETENDED LIKE
I DIDN'T HAVE ONE?

01:11:37.327 --> 01:11:38.726
WELL, I DID.

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.930
GINNY.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.832
I WANTED TO MARRY HER.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:51.372
I PUT AN ENGAGEMENT RING
ON HER FINGER,

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:54.542
BUT IT GOT STUCK,
SO SHE CUT IT OFF

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:56.711
AND MAILED IT BACK
TO ME IN PIECES.

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:59.314
I'M SORRY, I... I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DUMPED ON YOU.

01:11:59.316 --> 01:12:00.548
NO.

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.918
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME.

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:15.730
HEY, YOU.

- YOU.
- YOU.

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:21.903
- GOOD NIGHT.
- MMM.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:30.912
YOU KNOW, NEW YEAR'S EVE
IS SNEAKING UP ON US.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:33.047
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE HOME ALONE.
