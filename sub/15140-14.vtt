WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.719
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:01.785 --> 00:03.187
Templeton's boxing us in.

00:03.254 --> 00:05.222
Templeton is not choosing
my vice president.

00:05.289 --> 00:07.691
If you want a man
who's worth a damn in this job,

00:07.758 --> 00:09.560
you gotta make
this job worth a damn.

00:09.627 --> 00:12.730
I'm serious, Mom. You should,
um, move in here with us.

00:12.796 --> 00:17.067
I am moving out of the West Wing and
back to the first gentleman's office.

00:17.134 --> 00:19.003
Do you think what
you did was right?

00:19.069 --> 00:21.338
I am not gonna have
trouble sleeping tonight.

00:21.405 --> 00:23.274
You are relieved of your duties.

00:23.340 --> 00:27.444
See what happens when she
tries to get her nominees confirmed.

00:27.511 --> 00:29.780
- It ends.
- It's just begun.

00:37.087 --> 00:38.989
[siren blares]

00:42.126 --> 00:45.529
[Rod] Attorney General Brantley.
How does that sound, Carl?

00:45.596 --> 00:47.598
Not bad, not bad.

00:47.665 --> 00:49.934
The kids are happy
with the public schools?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.069
Logan's a little nervous
about the move.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.637
Schools are good.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.773
Are you selling
that great house of yours?

00:55.839 --> 00:58.809
We got three offers on it
the day you nominated me.

00:58.876 --> 01:01.645
I couldn't believe
we sold it just like that.

01:01.712 --> 01:03.647
What if he doesn't get confirmed?

01:03.714 --> 01:08.085
[Rod] He ran for governor as
a Republican. The party was behind him.

01:08.152 --> 01:11.422
The committee is majority Republican,
so he is de facto vetted.

01:13.290 --> 01:16.694
Sounds so easy. I don't know why
I am perpetually nervous about it.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.631
For tonight, let's just relax
and have a nice, quiet dinner out.

01:20.698 --> 01:23.567
- [yelling]
- Madam President.

01:26.904 --> 01:30.007
[woman] Mr. Brantley,
how does it feel to be nominated?

01:30.074 --> 01:32.943
Just a nice, quiet dinner out.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.079
[commotion continues]

01:35.145 --> 01:37.314
- [woman on TV] In other news...
- [knocking]

01:37.381 --> 01:40.084
Come on in.

01:40.150 --> 01:43.621
- A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Addison.
- Oh, please. Lance.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.490
Jayne, turn off those televisions.
Come. Sit down.

01:46.557 --> 01:48.959
Sorry it's so damned late.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.362
Day's schedule's been chock-a-block.

01:51.428 --> 01:53.731
Please. Mr. Speaker, my pleasure.

01:53.797 --> 01:57.434
- I'd make time for you at any hour.
- Lance is the best campaign guy around.

01:57.501 --> 02:00.137
Got Lawson elected, Calvino,

02:00.204 --> 02:03.073
- Riggs in Montana.
- Riggs?

02:03.140 --> 02:05.175
- You ran a good race.
- Thank you, sir.

02:05.242 --> 02:07.111
I'd love a chance to work with you.

02:07.177 --> 02:09.647
I think you're the best
presidential candidate.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.881
Thank you.

02:11.448 --> 02:15.052
Before Calvino, I ran Marcia Tucker's
gubernatorial bid in Connecticut.

02:15.119 --> 02:18.555
- Took on Carl Brantley in the primary.
- [Templeton] Oh, Mr. Brantley.

02:18.622 --> 02:22.026
Madam President's best friend,
her choice for attorney general.

02:22.092 --> 02:24.762
Yes. I did opposition
research on Brantley.

02:24.828 --> 02:28.799
We never used it. Tucker dropped out,
and we didn't want to damage Brantley.

02:28.866 --> 02:29.900
What'd you find?

02:29.967 --> 02:33.837
One of his first political appointments
was the Connecticut parole board.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.774
- [laughs]
- Now, during the four years he served,

02:36.840 --> 02:39.710
they granted parole
to almost 15,000 inmates.

02:39.777 --> 02:42.880
These are the briefs
for the cases we found,

02:42.946 --> 02:44.581
and the best one's on top.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.850
Proud boy.

02:47.418 --> 02:52.323
Somebody gets paroled or furloughed,
and then they commit a crime.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.892
- Lenox Walsh.
- What did he do?

02:54.958 --> 02:57.661
Shot an 82-year-old grandmother
in the face.

02:57.728 --> 02:59.396
[inhales deeply] Hmm.

02:59.463 --> 03:01.732
What can I say?
You've had a stellar career.

03:01.799 --> 03:05.536
No, no, no. Ending up here,
that's stellar.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.539
Being the AG of Connecticut,
that falls somewhere between,

03:08.605 --> 03:10.674
uh, pretty good
and not too shabby.

03:10.741 --> 03:14.011
Fast forward two weeks,
attorney general of the United States.

03:15.346 --> 03:18.582
OK, well, that gets
into stellar territory.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.953
Tell the truth.
How is Sue doing with all this?

03:23.020 --> 03:25.556
Well, she's not pleased
about leaving Hartford,

03:25.622 --> 03:28.192
but she... she does know
how much this means to me.

03:28.258 --> 03:31.795
And to me, I hope.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Carl.

03:31.862 --> 03:34.365
Every day around here is hard,

03:34.431 --> 03:38.535
24/7 in a way...
I can't even begin to describe.

03:38.602 --> 03:42.339
It's so important to me to have people
who are at the top of their game.

03:42.406 --> 03:44.942
People I trust.

03:47.711 --> 03:50.914
So tomorrow is gonna be
a hell of a long day for you,

03:50.981 --> 03:54.718
but if I can swing it, I'm gonna have
my VP give you a few pointers.

03:54.785 --> 03:58.555
You recall he went a couple of rounds
with the Senate at his confirmation.

03:58.622 --> 04:00.391
You'll sic General Keaton on me?

04:00.457 --> 04:02.726
He'll chew me up before
I get through the doors.

04:02.793 --> 04:04.995
Be good for you, toughen you up.

04:05.062 --> 04:07.631
Remember how I used
to kick your ass at Ms. Pac-Man?

04:07.698 --> 04:10.100
Oh, yeah. And foosball.

04:10.167 --> 04:11.835
Well, who'd have thunk it?

04:11.902 --> 04:15.839
Mac Allen,
queen of the Hartford Arcade...

04:15.906 --> 04:18.375
...president of the United States.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.614
It was the first gentleman's choice
to withdraw from the president's staff.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.783
[man chattering over earpiece]

04:25.849 --> 04:29.052
Would you be asking these
questions if the president's spouse

04:29.119 --> 04:31.455
were female and the president male?

04:31.522 --> 04:35.292
Mr. Calloway is an
accomplished, talented individual.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.394
He's also a loving father
and, yes,

04:37.461 --> 04:40.731
he's the husband to
the president of the United States.

04:40.798 --> 04:45.068
You seem to have a hard time
reconciling these roles. He doesn't.

04:45.135 --> 04:46.937
- [man] Thank you.
- OK. Thank you.

04:47.004 --> 04:49.339
Anytime.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.708
- Clear?
- [man] All clear.

04:54.178 --> 04:56.547
- That was great.
- For your boss or mine?

04:56.613 --> 04:58.215
Ours.

04:58.282 --> 05:02.019
The longer I know you, the creepier you
are. Have you been lurking back there?

05:02.085 --> 05:04.621
I'm a political consultant.
'Course I'm creepy.

05:04.688 --> 05:06.457
- You see my memo?
- [sighs] Yep.

05:06.523 --> 05:10.060
We have to sell Brantley as
toughest sheriff east of the Pecos,

05:10.127 --> 05:12.463
231 convictions, pro-death penalty.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.731
Nice job with
the first gentleman question.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.900
I'd have called the guy a sexist.

05:16.967 --> 05:19.570
That's the difference
between you and me.

05:19.636 --> 05:23.207
I'm the press secretary. You're not.

05:23.273 --> 05:26.877
And a fine one at that,
but there's being sincere and truthful,

05:26.944 --> 05:29.146
and there's being effective.

05:36.787 --> 05:39.756
My mother was at
an ATM to get money

05:39.823 --> 05:43.794
to buy a birthday present for my
daughter, her youngest grandchild.

05:43.861 --> 05:46.563
The bank's security cameras
recorded the whole thing.

05:46.630 --> 05:49.266
A man came up with a gun.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.402
She cooperated, gave him her money.

05:52.469 --> 05:54.838
And then she started begging.

05:54.905 --> 05:58.475
I can only imagine
what she was saying when he...

05:58.542 --> 06:01.178
- ...shot her in the face.
- [reporters] Mrs. Maxwell!

06:01.245 --> 06:04.915
Are you calling on the president to
withdraw Brantley as her nominee?

06:04.982 --> 06:06.950
Justice for Victims is a family group.

06:07.017 --> 06:09.119
We're not telling
the president what to do.

06:09.186 --> 06:11.755
We're just here
to simply let people know

06:11.822 --> 06:13.924
how victims of crime feel.

06:13.991 --> 06:18.228
Mrs. Maxwell, as a victim of crime, how
do you feel about Brantley's nomination

06:18.295 --> 06:22.032
to the highest law enforcement
position in the nation?

06:24.001 --> 06:28.305
Lenox Walsh was in prison
until Carl Brantley paroled him.

06:28.372 --> 06:30.207
A month later, he killed my mother.

06:30.274 --> 06:34.044
To the president,
Carl Brantley is an old friend.

06:34.111 --> 06:38.215
To me, he's the reason
my mother was murdered.

06:38.282 --> 06:41.418
[man] A victims' rights group
charged the president with cronyism

06:41.485 --> 06:44.421
and being soft on crime
after it was revealed

06:44.488 --> 06:48.292
that Brantley, her attorney general
nominee was responsible for the parole

06:48.358 --> 06:51.695
of a man who subsequently murdered
a Connecticut grandmother...

06:51.762 --> 06:55.399
- Game on.
- It's a start. What's next?

06:55.465 --> 06:58.068
...Senator Joe Peck,
chairing Brantley's hearing.

06:58.265 --> 07:01.138
We should talk to Joe Peck.
Make sure we're on the same page.

07:01.204 --> 07:03.574
I've already got Lance setting it up.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.977
Good girl.

07:07.044 --> 07:11.181
Gonna be an interesting day
at Mackenzie Allen's White House.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.642
[sprinklers rotating]

07:42.346 --> 07:44.414
Kelly, don't take it personally,

07:44.481 --> 07:48.151
but I hate when I see you waiting for me
first thing in the morning.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.153
A group called Justice for Victims

07:50.220 --> 07:53.023
just did a little dog-and-pony
show on the Capitol steps.

07:53.090 --> 07:56.994
You can't go ten feet without somebody
with a picket sign and a problem.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.098
Their problem's Carl Brantley. They're
calling him soft on crime, thereby...

08:01.164 --> 08:04.568
Painting me as soft on crime.
All right, what did we do?

08:04.635 --> 08:07.337
Paroled a man who went on
to kill an elderly lady.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.306
- Good morning.
- Thank you.

08:09.373 --> 08:12.476
Well, it's an unfortunate reality,

08:12.542 --> 08:15.278
but some parolees go on
to commit another crime.

08:15.345 --> 08:17.781
Did they mention when Carl
served with me as D.A.,

08:17.848 --> 08:21.284
he put more criminals behind bars
than anyone in Connecticut history?

08:21.351 --> 08:23.754
Thanks. You wrote
my morning talking points.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.590
Mm... wanna trade jobs?

08:26.657 --> 08:30.494
As stressful as my jobs is,
I think yours is a little harder.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.396
Kelly, Carl's a good man.

08:32.462 --> 08:35.832
- I'm counting on you to hold the line.
- Always.

08:35.899 --> 08:38.435
- Ma'am, they're ready in the Sit Room.
- Thank you.

08:38.502 --> 08:41.138
- Make sure the vice president joins us.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.275
- [beeping]
- [chattering]

08:45.342 --> 08:47.044
- General.
- [man] Morning, madam.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.245
Warren, how are you?

08:48.311 --> 08:51.515
I was fine until I heard about this
situation with the cargo plane.

08:51.581 --> 08:55.619
Yesterday a KC-130 cargo aircraft
experienced mechanical difficulties.

08:55.686 --> 08:59.022
They put down for maintenance on
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.

08:59.089 --> 09:01.958
He checked out fine,
he took off this morning.

09:02.025 --> 09:05.128
About an hour later, the pilot
missed calling in his waypoints

09:05.195 --> 09:07.597
- then missed a refueling rendezvous.
- Crashed?

09:07.664 --> 09:10.133
We've got searchers
going over the flight route,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.469
but we haven't found a crash site.

09:12.536 --> 09:14.871
But there's an added problem, ma'am.

09:14.938 --> 09:18.008
- What was on board?
- Most of the cargo was routine stuff.

09:18.075 --> 09:20.711
It was spare parts,
body armor, things like that.

09:20.777 --> 09:24.681
However, we also had a shipment
of 100 of our latest generation

09:24.748 --> 09:28.318
- Block III Stinger missiles.
- Handheld missile launchers.

09:28.385 --> 09:31.722
We're doing everything we can
to locate and secure the cargo.

09:31.788 --> 09:35.092
With your permission, I'll stay
on top of this on your behalf.

09:36.293 --> 09:38.328
Keep me posted.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.466
Oh, it might rain.
Shouldn't you have an umbrella?

09:42.532 --> 09:44.301
Guys don't use umbrellas, Grandma.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.703
Does that mean
I won't have my soccer practice?

09:46.770 --> 09:49.306
Mm, probably not.
Are you ready for your trig exam?

09:49.372 --> 09:52.075
- [Amy] What's trig?
- Fancy math. I think I need a tutor.

09:52.142 --> 09:55.445
- Uh, I'm good at numbers.
- [Rebecca] Ask Stacy for help.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.980
- Good luck on your test.
- Bye.

09:57.047 --> 09:58.915
- Have a nice day.
- [Rebecca] You too.

09:58.982 --> 10:01.151
Oh. See you later, alligator.

10:01.218 --> 10:05.255
- What are you gonna do till then?
- Oh... well, um...

10:05.322 --> 10:09.693
I... I'm not really sure.
I was thinking maybe I might...

10:09.760 --> 10:11.661
- ...I don't know...
- I gotta go. Bye!

10:11.728 --> 10:14.464
Oh... bye.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.400
Let's put it this way.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.970
The president and I
had a different vision

10:20.036 --> 10:21.805
on how best to run the country.

10:21.872 --> 10:26.576
I wanted to enforce the law of the land
as I had under President Bridges.

10:26.643 --> 10:28.345
- And she?
- She wants to fire anyone

10:28.411 --> 10:31.782
who voices a dissenting opinion
or takes a tougher stand than hers.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.917
Here is the reality
of the modern world.

10:33.984 --> 10:35.619
A criminal's civil rights

10:35.685 --> 10:38.455
cannot outweigh
the rights and safety

10:38.522 --> 10:41.591
we guarantee
our law-abiding citizens.

10:41.658 --> 10:43.693
In other words, she's soft on crime.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.529
Yeah. She's hard on her staff.

10:45.595 --> 10:49.399
I think that's why she surrounds herself
with less than experienced hands.

10:49.466 --> 10:52.569
Are you saying Carl Brantley
isn't qualified?

10:52.636 --> 10:55.238
Well, not if being qualified
means being her buddy.

10:55.305 --> 10:58.909
I mean, come on, it took her
six months to nominate her best friend?

10:58.975 --> 11:03.013
- [Mac] So it's a coordinated attack.
- Melanie's reputation precedes her.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.382
It's sour grapes
and will be taken that way.

11:05.448 --> 11:06.883
Frankly, she's irrelevant.

11:06.950 --> 11:10.020
She's the former attorney general
commenting on the nominee.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.923
And she's bringing home
a twofer for the Templeton camp.

11:12.989 --> 11:16.193
The president's soft
on crime and big on cronyism.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.929
[sighs] What about this
Ilene Maxwell? Her claim.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.697
The guy was in jail for petty theft.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.933
No one could have predicted
he'd take up meth

11:22.999 --> 11:25.001
and become homicidal after parole.

11:25.068 --> 11:28.705
The White House takes a defensive
stance, it'll be perceived as just that,

11:28.772 --> 11:32.609
defensive. I say no comment.
It's one case with a freak outcome.

11:32.676 --> 11:35.312
My opinion? Nominate
the deputy attorney general.

11:35.378 --> 11:38.181
Someone already doing the job.
Harder to remove.

11:39.382 --> 11:42.419
I'm standing by my nominee.
Get parole board statements,

11:42.485 --> 11:46.590
go over the record, prepare
talking points. I'm not backing down.

11:46.656 --> 11:48.558
Yes, ma'am.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.262
- Ma'am?
- He can handle

11:52.329 --> 11:54.431
whatever they throw his way.

11:54.497 --> 11:57.300
- He's committed to staying the course?
- [knocking]

11:57.367 --> 11:59.736
Warren. Tell me you're
here with good news.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.873
- I wish to hell I could.
- We located the missing aircraft yet?

12:02.939 --> 12:07.544
We have Global Hawk UAVs flying
a grid at 65,000 feet over the area.

12:07.611 --> 12:09.312
We haven't found a crash site.

12:09.379 --> 12:13.850
Given the nature of the terrain, it's
highly unlikely we'll find survivors.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.785
- At least, in time.
- We're sure?

12:15.852 --> 12:20.156
Yes, ma'am. I know that American
casualties are hard to stomach,

12:20.223 --> 12:23.226
but we have to turn
our attention to this weapons cache.

12:23.293 --> 12:26.930
Block III weighs 15 pounds. It's
easier to use than a digital camera.

12:26.997 --> 12:31.668
A terrorist, hell, a teenager, could
take himself to the Memorial Bridge,

12:31.735 --> 12:36.373
wait for a jet to leave Reagan National
and blow it out of the sky.

12:36.439 --> 12:39.509
I don't need to tell you
how grave a situation this could be.

12:39.576 --> 12:42.379
And if we fly low-flying planes
or helicopters in there,

12:42.445 --> 12:44.915
we risk the wrath
of the Pakistani government.

12:44.981 --> 12:48.885
I just know we have to get
those weapons back. Let's do it.

12:54.925 --> 12:59.129
[man] And after the brutal murder
of Audrey Maxwell by a killer,

12:59.195 --> 13:00.964
you and your parole board set free,

13:01.031 --> 13:06.002
you didn't think of offering some
sort of apology to her family?

13:06.069 --> 13:10.674
To be honest, the first I heard
of this case was this morning.

13:10.740 --> 13:14.978
You don't recall the case?
It... it wasn't important?

13:15.045 --> 13:18.748
The board reviewed
thousands of cases a year.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.684
At the time this was a petty thief.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.653
He became a cold-blooded killer.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.156
You don't think
parole boards should follow up?

13:26.222 --> 13:29.559
Say, when an innocent
grandmother gets shot in the face?

13:29.626 --> 13:31.494
[Carl] The system does follow up.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.396
But there's no mechanism in place

13:33.463 --> 13:36.566
that would allow
an individual parole board member,

13:36.633 --> 13:39.569
uh, to track decade-old cases.

13:39.636 --> 13:41.604
And you know that, senator.

13:41.671 --> 13:44.107
So is your position that

13:44.174 --> 13:46.743
no one is responsible
for this sort of mistake?

13:46.810 --> 13:50.914
As a society we're just to... accept it?

13:50.981 --> 13:54.417
Would that be your position
as attorney general?

13:57.554 --> 14:00.857
He's a good man with a strong record,
a conservative prosecutor.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.259
He shot an 82-year-old
grandmother in the face.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.929
No, he didn't shoot anyone.
He sat on a parole board

14:05.996 --> 14:08.932
that reviewed thousands of cases.
Of those, one person...

14:08.999 --> 14:11.768
Shot an 82-year-old
grandmother in the face.

14:11.835 --> 14:14.938
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Oh, I don't know.

14:15.005 --> 14:17.374
It's catchy?
It's got a certain ring?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.576
Because we better
get used to hearing it.

14:19.642 --> 14:22.045
They tested those words.
Every variation.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.048
Killed an old lady.
Murdered a woman for $300.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.150
They tested it all. But when they got

14:27.217 --> 14:30.887
to "shot an 82-year-old grandmother
in the face," it blew off the charts.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.890
- Doesn't make them right.
- It doesn't matter what happened

14:33.957 --> 14:37.394
or who he is or what kind of attorney
general he'd make. He's going down.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.096
The only question is
whether we go down with him.

14:48.171 --> 14:50.507
Daddy, have you seen Grandma?

14:50.573 --> 14:52.909
No, I haven't.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.812
She's always here
when get home from school.

14:55.879 --> 14:58.948
- [sighs] Did you check the kitchen?
- Yep.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.884
OK, and her room?

15:02.952 --> 15:06.089
- Maybe she went out for a walk.
- She doesn't like to walk.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.957
It hurts her feet.

15:08.024 --> 15:10.627
Well, I am sure
that she is here somewhere.

15:10.693 --> 15:14.364
I don't think so. She took her purse.

15:15.732 --> 15:18.435
I hate political polling.

15:18.501 --> 15:22.672
Focus groups make my skin crawl.

15:22.739 --> 15:24.441
That being said,

15:24.507 --> 15:26.843
we had Lance Addison
run a little poll for us.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.819
The majority of Americans think
it's wrong to set criminals free.

15:35.885 --> 15:37.720
Shocking, isn't it?

15:39.522 --> 15:40.924
I have to hand it to you.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.927
You really made dollar out
of a dime with Brantley's record.

15:43.993 --> 15:46.129
Thanks to your gracious participation.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.365
Well, anything to help
in your toe-to-toe with our president.

15:49.432 --> 15:51.634
Current president.

15:51.701 --> 15:57.373
Her Lance did another poll.
It seems, contrary to Ms. Allen,

15:57.440 --> 16:00.810
that the American people feel
you cut quite an impressive figure.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.546
You tested ten points higher
than the mayor of New York

16:03.613 --> 16:06.983
when asked who was tougher on crime.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.986
Well, like they say,
hindsight's twenty-twenty.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.455
Well, I look both ways, Melanie.

16:12.522 --> 16:15.625
And to my mind,
you were robbed.

16:16.593 --> 16:19.229
You were robbed of your dignity,
of your position.

16:19.295 --> 16:21.498
American people were
robbed of your wisdom,

16:21.564 --> 16:24.300
of the clarity of your decision-making

16:24.367 --> 16:26.603
when she removed you
as attorney general.

16:26.669 --> 16:28.605
Well, you won't get an argument from me.

16:28.671 --> 16:30.673
Well, it is my hope

16:30.740 --> 16:34.744
that in one year...

16:34.811 --> 16:38.047
...you will be returned
to you rightful position

16:38.114 --> 16:39.649
at the White House,

16:39.716 --> 16:43.086
as the highest law
enforcement officer in the land.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.326
- That's great. Thank you.
- OK.

16:50.393 --> 16:52.929
- Hey.
- Hey. I'm sorry I missed dinner.

16:52.996 --> 16:55.165
- Things have been so crazy.
- Yeah, look, uh,

16:55.231 --> 16:58.668
I know you've got a lot on your plate,
but have you spoken to your mother?

16:58.735 --> 17:01.371
- Not since breakfast.
- She mention going somewhere?

17:01.437 --> 17:04.207
- No. What's going on?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.510
Just, uh, having
a hard time finding her.

17:09.412 --> 17:12.615
At 1:24 this afternoon,
Mrs. Allen exited the residence

17:12.682 --> 17:16.352
through the Diplomatic Reception Room
and through the southwest gate.

17:16.419 --> 17:19.055
And she hasn't signed back in?

17:19.122 --> 17:20.256
Ma'am, if I may...

17:20.323 --> 17:24.060
...I have every reason to believe
Mrs. Allen is safe and secure.

17:24.127 --> 17:28.965
- I'd suggest we just... sit tight.
- Why? Do you know something we don't?

17:30.767 --> 17:33.870
Ma'am, when Mrs. Allen left,
she gave the agent on duty

17:33.937 --> 17:37.707
an address and phone number where
she could be reached in emergency.

17:37.774 --> 17:41.611
- Asked us to respect her privacy.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

17:41.678 --> 17:45.481
She also asked that
we not tell her daughter.

17:46.249 --> 17:49.886
[Rod] Well, the Service
thinks she's fine.

17:49.953 --> 17:51.421
She's a grown woman.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.694
All right. I want to know
the second she gets back.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.196
I'll see to it. Ma'am. Sir.

18:05.235 --> 18:07.503
- Ma'am?
- Let me guess. Sit Room.

18:09.906 --> 18:12.875
One of the UAVs has picked up
a significant heat signature

18:12.942 --> 18:16.479
here in southern Hindu Kush. It's
what we'd expect if we had C-130 down.

18:16.546 --> 18:19.649
Problem is, those hills
are crawling with terrorists.

18:19.716 --> 18:23.052
There's a lot of very bad people
making a beeline for that plane.

18:23.119 --> 18:25.722
- Can we secure the cargo?
- We can get special forces

18:25.788 --> 18:28.024
and munitions recovery guys
in 12 hours.

18:28.091 --> 18:31.194
If terrorists have recovered
the antiaircraft missiles,

18:31.261 --> 18:33.663
we'd be sending our planes
on a suicide mission.

18:33.730 --> 18:36.833
- Intelligence estimate, they aware?
- Hasn't made the papers.

18:36.899 --> 18:39.335
Well, with any luck,
it never will.

18:39.402 --> 18:42.205
Let's just get in and out of there
as quickly as we can.

18:42.272 --> 18:45.608
The president took time out
with AmeriCorps leaders today

18:45.675 --> 18:47.877
to defend her nominee
for attorney general.

18:47.944 --> 18:50.013
I'm only sorry that my opponents

18:50.079 --> 18:52.815
have manipulated a family's tragedy

18:52.882 --> 18:56.352
into an attack on a man who would make
an outstanding attorney general.

18:56.419 --> 18:58.888
And I urge the public
and the press

18:58.955 --> 19:02.825
to look at Carl Brantley's full career
dedicated to law enforcement

19:02.892 --> 19:05.561
rather than one case
taken out of context.

19:05.628 --> 19:08.231
Ilene Maxwell, daughter
of the slain woman,

19:08.298 --> 19:10.933
disagreed with the president's
characterization.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.904
The only context our family needs is
that my mother was murdered.

19:14.971 --> 19:19.175
Victims for Justice today released
footage from an ATM security camera

19:19.242 --> 19:22.345
which captured the murder
of grandmother, Audrey Maxwell.

19:22.412 --> 19:27.450
We should warn viewers this footage
is graphic, violent and disturbing.

19:27.517 --> 19:28.618
[Sue] Turn it off.

19:30.953 --> 19:32.355
[TV clicks off]

19:34.557 --> 19:36.659
This was a big mistake, wasn't it?

19:36.726 --> 19:39.028
No, honey. No. It's just...

19:39.095 --> 19:41.898
- It's part of the process.
- Really?

19:41.964 --> 19:44.200
Calling you a murderer
is part of the process.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.036
It's unfair, I know.
But it will end.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.206
When they convinced everyone
Carl allows killers to go free?

19:50.273 --> 19:53.343
Sue, it's just noise.
They're grabbing at straws.

19:53.409 --> 19:57.113
- Doing what they can to discredit him.
- It's working, isn't it?

19:58.681 --> 20:00.116
Sue, you...

20:01.150 --> 20:03.886
- Maybe I should...
- No, no, no. I'll talk to her.

20:08.925 --> 20:11.394
It's not your fault, you know.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.463
Yeah, it is.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.465
I chose him.

20:29.245 --> 20:32.515
Where the hell have you been?

20:32.582 --> 20:34.550
Good morning.

20:34.617 --> 20:36.753
Uh, here and there.
Out and about.

20:36.819 --> 20:40.490
- All night?
- I-I left word with the Service.

20:40.556 --> 20:44.193
Right. That you were
at some undisclosed location.

20:44.260 --> 20:47.497
Didn't stop Amy from panicking
that her grandmother was missing.

20:47.563 --> 20:50.933
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.702
I meant to get back sooner.

20:52.769 --> 20:55.705
Time just got away from me.

20:55.772 --> 20:59.609
- I'll talk to her.
- Good. Do that.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.311
Right after you talk to me.

21:02.378 --> 21:03.813
Where did you go, Mom?

21:05.548 --> 21:09.419
- Atlantic City?
- No. For heaven's sake...

21:09.485 --> 21:11.988
- I haven't played slots in years.
- Where were you?

21:12.054 --> 21:15.958
[sighs] I was with a friend, Mackenzie.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.962
I do have them, you know.

21:20.029 --> 21:23.132
- Hey. You're home.
- Am I?

21:26.269 --> 21:30.039
- So did she say where she was?
- Not exactly.

21:30.106 --> 21:33.609
- You run out of razors?
- Oh, this?

21:33.676 --> 21:37.513
I got nothing on
the books yesterday, today.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.515
It's not a complaint,
it's just a fact.

21:39.582 --> 21:42.685
I see. Kinda cute.

21:43.453 --> 21:45.188
Did you see Sue this morning?

21:45.254 --> 21:47.657
I haven't seen either one of them.
Have you?

21:48.558 --> 21:50.760
Honey. They're gonna be fine.

21:51.661 --> 21:53.629
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:57.433 --> 21:59.268
[Vince] Kelly.

22:02.638 --> 22:04.106
Kelly.

22:05.775 --> 22:08.644
- Right this way, Mr. Clooney.
- Huh?

22:08.711 --> 22:11.481
- Sorry. I must've dozed off.
- Yeah.

22:11.547 --> 22:15.151
I was with you at the mess yesterday
when you got that mustard stain.

22:15.218 --> 22:17.386
Did you sleep here last night?

22:17.453 --> 22:20.323
This desk is actually
more comfortable than it looks.

22:20.389 --> 22:24.193
Oh, my God, look at the time.
I have the morning gaggle at 7:00,

22:24.260 --> 22:28.064
I have 58 minutes to cram all the
mind-numbing facts I can into my brain

22:28.130 --> 22:31.734
if for no other reason than to remember
things I can't say to reporters.

22:31.801 --> 22:35.204
And two minutes to pee.
That smells good.

22:36.005 --> 22:39.108
Hey, you did a great job with
the Brantley story yesterday.

22:39.175 --> 22:41.611
Thanks.

22:42.411 --> 22:44.780
- And Kelly?
- Hmm?

22:44.847 --> 22:46.682
You rock.

22:51.621 --> 22:54.156
Sue, is everything OK?

22:54.490 --> 22:56.592
I blame myself more than I blame him.

22:56.659 --> 22:58.794
I really just
didn't think it through.

22:58.861 --> 23:01.564
I don't know why
we ever sold the house.

23:01.631 --> 23:05.101
Well, obviously because you
believe in Carl's confirmation

23:05.167 --> 23:06.936
as much as Mackenzie does.

23:07.003 --> 23:10.306
[sighs] Look, I thought I could do this,
but I'm not sure that I can.

23:10.373 --> 23:12.441
I'm not sure that
anyone should have to.

23:12.508 --> 23:15.745
- Is there something I can do?
- Make them stop.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.548
Oh, honey, I wish I could.

23:18.614 --> 23:21.284
I wish Mac could. But she can't.

23:21.350 --> 23:25.821
What I can tell you is that
it is worth sticking it out.

23:25.888 --> 23:28.791
Your husband is going to be
in the position to make history.

23:28.858 --> 23:30.927
[laughs] To be history.

23:33.963 --> 23:37.533
[Sue] It's just...
[sighs] ...a lot.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.704
You're doing a stellar job
with the hearings.

23:42.572 --> 23:45.408
It's having quite an impact.

23:45.474 --> 23:48.911
We have the poor bastard sweating
more than a hooker at high mass.

23:48.978 --> 23:50.913
Yeah, I feel kinda sorry for him.

23:50.980 --> 23:52.048
Not a bad guy.

23:53.382 --> 23:55.985
Pangs of pity from Nathan Templeton?

23:56.052 --> 23:57.787
You want me to throw in the towel?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.755
No, no, no.

23:59.822 --> 24:02.625
Carl Brantley may be a good man,

24:02.692 --> 24:04.393
but it's not about him.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.028
It's about her.

24:06.095 --> 24:08.864
The hearings are hurting
her presidency, no doubt.

24:08.931 --> 24:11.334
- How much longer will they last?
- [scoffs]

24:11.400 --> 24:14.937
- If she doesn't pull the nomination?
- She won't pull the nomination.

24:15.004 --> 24:18.307
She's headstrong.
That's her Achilles heel.

24:20.276 --> 24:22.244
How long do you figure?

24:22.311 --> 24:24.480
Another week, ten days.

24:24.547 --> 24:29.018
I'm calling the victim's family. That
should give us a good shot of press.

24:29.085 --> 24:30.987
That could backfire on you.

24:31.454 --> 24:34.857
Yeah, that could look
like an overt political attack.

24:34.924 --> 24:38.327
From a woman whose mother
was murdered? She'll get a pass.

24:38.394 --> 24:42.498
Probably. But why don't
we take the high road?

24:42.565 --> 24:46.802
[laughs] Do you have
a particular high road in mind?

24:47.770 --> 24:50.740
You know, the president asked us

24:50.806 --> 24:54.243
to examine her nominee's entire career,

24:54.310 --> 24:58.881
not just focus on one case.

24:58.948 --> 25:01.984
So why don't
we respect her wishes?

25:06.288 --> 25:07.690
What's this?

25:07.757 --> 25:10.459
Highlight of Carl Brantley's career.

25:10.526 --> 25:12.895
Cases he declined
to prosecute when he was a DA,

25:12.962 --> 25:14.830
cases he lost,

25:14.897 --> 25:18.300
other prisoners paroled under
his watch who went on to commit crimes.

25:18.367 --> 25:21.871
So he can sit there
and deny he's soft on crime

25:21.937 --> 25:23.606
not just once,

25:23.673 --> 25:26.442
but over and over and over again.

25:29.345 --> 25:31.747
In April of 1999,

25:31.814 --> 25:35.584
your office declined
to prosecute Percy Chilton,

25:36.419 --> 25:38.320
who had prior convictions for

25:38.387 --> 25:40.656
rape and battery,

25:40.723 --> 25:45.361
after he was arrested for attacking
a young woman. Do you recall the case?

25:45.428 --> 25:47.663
No, I don't, sir,
but I can tell you that

25:47.730 --> 25:51.567
none of those previous convictions
would have been admissible in court.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.269
Perhaps not,

25:53.335 --> 25:56.439
but might they have inspired
your office to take a harder look?

25:56.505 --> 25:59.241
We reviewed hundreds
of cases a week, senator,

25:59.308 --> 26:02.812
and we looked hard at each
and every one of them.

26:02.878 --> 26:05.614
If you'd like me to come
and review that file with you...

26:05.681 --> 26:09.218
Let's look at another case
you declined to prosecute.

26:09.285 --> 26:12.254
Leon Korakin. Arrested for conspiracy...

26:12.321 --> 26:15.357
- [chattering]
- General. Gentlemen.

26:16.759 --> 26:19.295
- Where's the vice president?
- He couldn't be here.

26:19.361 --> 26:21.697
- Have we recovered the weapons?
- No, ma'am.

26:21.764 --> 26:24.800
- Pave Hawks took fire.
- From antiaircraft missiles?

26:24.867 --> 26:27.603
No, it was just small arms.
But we had to back off anyway.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.739
Is it terrorists
after the weapons cargo?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.942
That or locals who don't
want us there for their own reasons.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.111
We couldn't reach the crash site.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.313
- We sending Rangers?
- Yes, on their way.

26:37.379 --> 26:39.248
- Let me know when they get there.
- Yes.

26:39.315 --> 26:42.017
Did he have an appointment? Warren.

26:42.084 --> 26:46.222
I don't know, ma'am.
He didn't say, and I didn't ask.

26:46.288 --> 26:48.624
Thank you.

26:49.992 --> 26:52.461
I know you didn't expect it
to get this ugly.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.364
This is a new low. Even for them.

26:56.298 --> 26:59.502
Well, it was a nice idea
while it lasted.

27:00.569 --> 27:03.572
Two old friends... changing the world.

27:03.639 --> 27:05.908
- We still can.
- You can.

27:06.942 --> 27:10.112
I want to make it easy
for you. I'm withdrawing.

27:12.014 --> 27:14.450
I don't want you to do that.

27:14.517 --> 27:16.852
You'll make a great attorney general.

27:16.919 --> 27:19.121
No, I won't. I'm a liability.

27:19.188 --> 27:22.224
Let me worry about whether
you're an asset or liability.

27:22.291 --> 27:24.426
I told myself from the beginning,

27:24.493 --> 27:27.296
if I'm gonna do this job,
I'm gonna do it with integrity.

27:27.363 --> 27:29.732
I'm not gonna walk away
from a good friend

27:29.799 --> 27:31.367
over politics.

27:31.433 --> 27:33.769
This isn't about you
standing up for me.

27:33.836 --> 27:37.239
I want out. At some point,
you admit defeat.

27:38.207 --> 27:41.310
If you don't want to take the heat,
that's your decision.

27:41.377 --> 27:45.848
But I believe in you, and I believe
in what we can do together.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.383
And if you'll keep fighting,

27:47.449 --> 27:50.886
I will commit the full power
of this office to winning.

27:50.953 --> 27:55.791
Even if we could win, it...
it wouldn't end. They'd be all over me.

27:55.858 --> 27:59.195
As your attorney general,
anything I do, they'll use against you.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.532
Welcome to my world.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.606
You really think we can win it?

28:10.673 --> 28:13.209
I have no idea.

28:14.977 --> 28:19.682
But I'll go down swinging with you.
I promise you that.

28:29.158 --> 28:31.927
Their strategy is
to kill us in committee.

28:31.994 --> 28:35.564
If we don't pull that nomination,
they'll tear him apart in the hearings.

28:35.631 --> 28:38.367
What if I demand an up-or-down vote
in the full Senate?

28:38.434 --> 28:40.903
Make the committee stop
raking him over the coals.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.239
Standing by your friend
makes you look strong.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.441
Do we have votes to win
the confirmation?

28:45.507 --> 28:49.111
- Can you deliver the Democrats?
- That's what I'm here for, son.

28:49.178 --> 28:51.480
All right.
Let's get started first thing.

28:51.547 --> 28:55.184
Even if we get the Democrats,
we won't win without some Republicans.

28:55.251 --> 28:57.786
- How many?
- A handful of senators could swing it.

28:57.853 --> 29:00.456
We're not the only ones
putting the screws to them.

29:00.522 --> 29:03.459
Templeton. He's got a good strategy.

29:03.525 --> 29:06.562
Beat up Brantley in committee
while he sits, collects votes.

29:06.629 --> 29:09.899
He doesn't control what happens
on the Senate floor, but...

29:09.965 --> 29:13.135
...the House is his.
Legislation, the budget, careers.

29:13.202 --> 29:17.339
If he goes after the same senators
we do, it's going to be a tough fight.

29:17.406 --> 29:20.409
- He's got a lot to offer them.
- We have to offer them more.

29:20.476 --> 29:22.177
How far are you willing to go?

29:22.244 --> 29:25.214
I'm not gonna make any deals
I can't live with,

29:25.281 --> 29:27.283
but we're gonna have to get creative.

29:31.654 --> 29:34.657
You want to start horse-trading? Now?

29:34.723 --> 29:37.526
[Jim] We want to get things done.
Don't you?

29:37.593 --> 29:40.963
- Depends what we're talking about.
- Well, you tell me.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.266
We all know Carl Brantley
will make a strong attorney general.

29:44.333 --> 29:48.737
[Templeton] So if we put Rea in charge
of the House Committee on Resources,

29:48.804 --> 29:51.407
Carnes in charge of Science,

29:51.473 --> 29:54.143
then you'd control all you need for...

29:54.209 --> 29:57.913
Senator, I brought you the chance to do
right by your commander in chief.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.815
A billion dollar appropriation...

29:59.882 --> 30:03.452
I know you you want her to ease up
on those sanctions against Indonesia.

30:03.519 --> 30:05.120
Half of it could go to your state.

30:05.187 --> 30:07.923
You don't get credit
for your faith-based initiatives.

30:07.990 --> 30:09.758
[Templeton] A question of loyalty.

30:09.825 --> 30:11.827
[Mac] I'd shine
a spotlight on your work.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.062
You can count on the RNC.

30:13.128 --> 30:15.664
We could make farm
subsidies more of a priority.

30:15.731 --> 30:19.134
[Mac] If I thought you could start
working with me in a reasonable

30:19.201 --> 30:22.338
and constructive way, then yes,

30:22.404 --> 30:24.373
you would have my endorsement.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.975
She said she'd endorse Lee?

30:26.041 --> 30:28.877
- She feels she can work with him.
- But Lee?

30:28.944 --> 30:31.113
I like it.
It gives us points on the right.

30:31.180 --> 30:33.515
Does it give us the votes
to get him confirmed?

30:34.149 --> 30:38.654
- [sighs, laughs] I don't see them.
- [Kelly] The vote's not till tomorrow.

30:38.721 --> 30:41.890
- We haven't played our biggest card.
- We've given every gift.

30:41.957 --> 30:44.526
- What's left?
- What's left is the president.

30:44.593 --> 30:46.996
Her conference is at 5:00.
She'll bring it home.

30:47.062 --> 30:51.000
- I hope you're right.
- We're close on Quinn, Duke and Paxton.

30:51.066 --> 30:54.737
We'll close them after
the press conference. Watch and see.

30:54.803 --> 30:56.405
[reporters] Madam President!

30:56.472 --> 30:59.141
By stopping the hearings
and calling for a vote,

30:59.208 --> 31:02.911
aren't you preventing the Senate's
full review of the his qualifications?

31:02.978 --> 31:06.382
If they were sincerely reviewing
Carl Brantley's qualifications,

31:06.448 --> 31:09.518
that might be so.
But we all know that's not the case.

31:09.585 --> 31:12.121
You don't think it's sincere
to look at his record?

31:12.187 --> 31:13.856
What record are they looking at?

31:13.922 --> 31:18.227
His highest conviction rate of any
prosecutor in Connecticut's history?

31:18.293 --> 31:20.129
What about Audrey Maxwell's murder ?

31:20.195 --> 31:24.466
Carl Brantley sat on a parole board
that released a small-time burglar.

31:24.533 --> 31:28.604
The parole board's only failure
was not being psychic.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.407
Make no mistake
about what's going on here.

31:31.473 --> 31:34.710
A tragic event is being
manipulated for political gain.

31:34.777 --> 31:38.680
The people doing it believe that
Americans will react so strongly

31:38.747 --> 31:42.751
to crime-scene footage and provocative
language that the truth won't matter.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.154
I think Americans
are smarter than that.

31:45.220 --> 31:50.092
And I pray that the Senate will rise
above it and do the right thing.

31:50.159 --> 31:53.662
I just spoke with Senator Quinn.
He's in. Along with Paxton and Duke.

31:53.729 --> 31:55.764
- I think we're there.
- Congratulations.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.100
Will it hold until
the vote tomorrow morning?

31:58.167 --> 32:01.570
Templeton will find out. So will Peck.
They'll fight to the last vote.

32:01.637 --> 32:04.073
Do we have a plan B
in case we lose these guys?

32:04.139 --> 32:08.210
- These guys were our plan B.
- And we don't have a plan C.

32:08.277 --> 32:11.680
We'll stay on it all night.
Keep working the options.

32:13.015 --> 32:14.917
Make no mistake
about what's going on.

32:14.983 --> 32:18.387
A tragic event is being
manipulated for political gain.

32:18.454 --> 32:21.957
The people doing it believe
Americans will react so strongly...

32:22.024 --> 32:23.959
- [footsteps]
- [Jayne] Mr. Speaker.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.361
Senators Duke, Quinn and Paxton.

32:26.428 --> 32:30.399
Gentlemen. It's great of you to come.
I knew I could count on you.

32:33.569 --> 32:37.005
Well done. Very good. Ma'am.

32:37.072 --> 32:39.675
Warren. Do you have anything for me?

32:39.741 --> 32:42.211
I just got word
from the Ranger team leader.

32:42.277 --> 32:44.246
They've secured the crash site,

32:44.313 --> 32:47.249
and the accident response group
is on the ground.

32:47.316 --> 32:49.618
- Any casualties going in?
- None.

32:49.685 --> 32:52.821
Apparently whoever was shooting
beat a hasty retreat.

32:52.888 --> 32:54.556
Do we know who it was?

32:54.623 --> 32:57.359
Opium's the cash crop
in that part of the world, ma'am.

32:57.426 --> 33:00.395
I think the Pave Hawks ran
across growers moving product.

33:00.462 --> 33:02.531
Hmm. How soon until
we have the missiles?

33:02.598 --> 33:04.766
- At this point, it's hard to say.
- All right.

33:04.833 --> 33:07.402
- Let me know as soon as they're secure.
- Very well.

33:07.469 --> 33:09.571
Warren? Everything OK?

33:09.638 --> 33:13.075
- Ma'am?
- Just yesterday, the Sit Room.

33:13.142 --> 33:16.411
Just some family matters
I had to look after.

33:16.478 --> 33:19.248
- OK. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:28.891 --> 33:31.927
- Hey.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

33:31.994 --> 33:33.929
I mean, I know I am, but...

33:33.996 --> 33:35.898
Mom, it's OK. What's up?

33:35.964 --> 33:38.834
Um... guilt.

33:40.068 --> 33:42.404
About...?

33:42.471 --> 33:45.240
Not telling you where I was.

33:45.307 --> 33:46.608
You deserve to know.

33:47.643 --> 33:50.379
- OK.
- OK.

33:59.188 --> 34:01.190
- Oh.
- This is Bill Harrison.

34:01.256 --> 34:04.026
- How do you do?
- It's an honor, Madam President.

34:04.092 --> 34:05.928
Thank you.

34:05.994 --> 34:07.629
Bill and I... um...

34:10.566 --> 34:14.603
Bill is my boyfriend.
We have been dating,

34:14.670 --> 34:18.106
uh, on and off for a year now.

34:18.640 --> 34:21.076
- Dating.
- We met in Connecticut

34:21.143 --> 34:25.647
at a country club.
I still live there... in Connecticut.

34:25.714 --> 34:27.783
Right. Right.

34:27.849 --> 34:31.620
- So am I to understand...?
- [stammering]

34:31.687 --> 34:35.390
- We stayed in a hotel, yes.
- OK. Well, you know what, Mom?

34:35.457 --> 34:36.959
You don't have to...

34:37.025 --> 34:40.162
I would have told you
sooner about us, but, um...

34:40.229 --> 34:44.299
- ...there's a little hitch.
- A hitch.

34:45.601 --> 34:48.537
Bill is married.

34:48.604 --> 34:51.707
[stammers] Don't panic.
I am not a home-wrecker.

34:51.773 --> 34:54.443
My wife suffered
a stroke eight years ago.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.379
She's been
in a nursing home ever since.

34:57.446 --> 35:01.450
I figured any way you sliced it,
it wouldn't look good.

35:01.516 --> 35:04.786
So when I moved to the White House,

35:04.853 --> 35:07.756
uh... I put an end to it.

35:07.823 --> 35:10.926
But I just couldn't let her go.

35:10.993 --> 35:13.462
You crazy old coot.

35:15.430 --> 35:18.533
Anyway, there you have it.

35:20.235 --> 35:24.039
OK, then. Uh, not quite sure
what to do with it, but...

35:24.106 --> 35:25.974
- [knocking]
- Sorry to disturb you,

35:26.041 --> 35:28.277
- but I think that...
- Oh, no, please.

35:28.343 --> 35:32.514
We have to go. You get back to work.
We'll see you... later.

35:32.581 --> 35:34.583
Bye-bye.

35:36.585 --> 35:38.687
- Don't ask.
- I won't.

35:38.754 --> 35:40.689
Here. This is from Mr. Gardner.

35:43.392 --> 35:47.763
- What is it?
- We lost Quinn, Duke and Paxton.

35:51.266 --> 35:52.734
What happened?

35:52.801 --> 35:55.437
Best guess is that
Senator Peck got to them.

35:55.504 --> 35:58.006
He chairs the committee.
Where he goes they follow.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.310
- And Templeton got to Senator Peck.
- They work hand in glove.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.513
It's all part of Templeton's
presidential campaign.

36:05.681 --> 36:09.117
Let's get Senator Peck in here,
first thing, before the vote.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.621
Peck is facing a major challenger
in his next election.

36:12.688 --> 36:15.257
Stan Dennison,
banking billionaire, self-funder.

36:15.324 --> 36:18.827
- I know.
- He needs his party's support to win.

36:18.894 --> 36:22.197
That means Templeton's support.
He can't afford to rock the boat.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.566
Because he doesn't want
to lose his seat.

36:24.633 --> 36:27.769
That may be our plan C.

36:29.938 --> 36:33.208
With due respect, Madam President,
the vote's in less than an hour.

36:33.275 --> 36:37.012
There's nothing you can offer
that would change my position.

36:37.079 --> 36:40.115
I understand you have a tough
re-election campaign ahead,

36:40.182 --> 36:43.051
fighting a wealthy opponent,
running behind in the polls.

36:43.118 --> 36:46.688
All the more reason I can't afford
to alienate my party leadership.

36:46.755 --> 36:49.024
Makes sense. Makes sense.

36:49.091 --> 36:51.626
You know, it occurs to me

36:51.693 --> 36:54.463
that we need a new secretary
of the treasury, right, Jim?

36:54.529 --> 36:57.099
- I believe we are.
- [laughs]

36:57.165 --> 37:00.769
You think I'd throw away
a lifetime relationship

37:00.836 --> 37:03.972
with the Republican Party
for a couple years in your cabinet?

37:04.039 --> 37:08.910
No offense, but I've seen
what happens to your nominees.

37:08.977 --> 37:12.781
Oh, no, I...
I wasn't thinking of you.

37:12.848 --> 37:16.785
Uh, I don't really see you as
a treasury secretary. No offense.

37:16.852 --> 37:20.055
No. I was thinking of your opponent.

37:20.122 --> 37:23.258
He got rich as a banker,
he cares about the economy,

37:23.325 --> 37:25.694
I think he'd be
a heck of a guy for the job.

37:25.761 --> 37:28.630
And I don't imagine
it's an opportunity he'd turn down.

37:28.697 --> 37:32.467
At least that's the impression I got
when we met with him this morning.

37:32.534 --> 37:34.836
- You think so?
- He said it's a dream come true.

37:34.903 --> 37:37.539
- There you go.
- It would take is Senate confirmation,

37:37.606 --> 37:39.808
which I'm sure you could arrange.

37:39.875 --> 37:42.144
That would take him out of your race,

37:42.210 --> 37:44.646
clear the field for you.

37:46.047 --> 37:48.717
I'll, uh...

37:48.784 --> 37:51.253
...have to give it some thought.

37:51.319 --> 37:55.090
You can think about it on the way over.
They're getting ready to call the vote.

38:04.199 --> 38:08.303
[woman on TV] In a surprise turnabout,
Senator Joe Peck reluctantly endorsed

38:08.370 --> 38:11.840
the president's candidate
for attorney general, Carl Brantley.

38:11.907 --> 38:16.311
As voting begins, it is clear
that Brantley now has the support

38:16.378 --> 38:18.647
needed for that confirmation.
We are told...

38:18.713 --> 38:22.217
Whatever she gave him, we will make sure
the punishment is worse.

38:22.284 --> 38:24.619
I don't give a damn
about Joe Peck right now.

38:24.686 --> 38:27.823
[Jayne] I'm just a sore loser, I guess.

38:27.889 --> 38:30.025
It's good to lose a battle.

38:30.091 --> 38:34.095
- Teaches you how to better win the war.
- She got her man his job.

38:34.162 --> 38:37.799
- It feels like this war is over.
- No. This war is for the presidency.

38:37.866 --> 38:40.235
Never lose sight of that.

38:40.302 --> 38:43.638
She got her man.
Now she's gonna have to wear him.

38:43.705 --> 38:47.042
Every case his office fumbles,

38:47.108 --> 38:49.511
every failure of justice...

38:50.212 --> 38:52.881
...they're all going to be hers.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.986
From now on, we don't stop.

38:58.053 --> 39:01.356
Attack, attack, attack, attack.

39:05.126 --> 39:08.063
- [knocking]
- Do you take walks-ins?

39:08.129 --> 39:09.598
Come on in.

39:09.664 --> 39:12.434
I'm just packing up for the night.

39:12.501 --> 39:15.704
From the looks of things,
your night is far from over.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.674
So... Attorney General Brantley.
How's it sound now?

39:19.741 --> 39:22.711
Oh, better a week ago,
but I'll take it. I'll take it.

39:22.777 --> 39:26.081
I know that my confirmation hearings
came at a cost to you.

39:26.147 --> 39:27.782
Don't worry about me.

39:27.849 --> 39:31.086
This is not the last time you're
gonna be the target of criticism.

39:31.152 --> 39:33.922
I... I don't know how
you handle it at this level.

39:33.989 --> 39:36.091
Some days better than others.

39:36.157 --> 39:39.227
But on the good days,
I try to remember that

39:39.294 --> 39:42.864
every advancement in history
has been met with opposition.

39:44.065 --> 39:48.236
Remember back in school, I saved your
butt by lending you my con law notes?

39:48.303 --> 39:50.071
- Yeah.
- I recall you telling me

39:50.138 --> 39:53.608
that you owed me one.
Consider it even.

39:56.778 --> 39:58.513
- Ma'am.
- Jim.

40:00.549 --> 40:02.050
It's all right.

40:02.117 --> 40:05.120
The recovery team finished
its sweep of the C-130 crash site.

40:05.186 --> 40:07.889
- Everything OK?
- They've secured most of the cargo.

40:07.956 --> 40:09.391
Most?

40:09.457 --> 40:13.228
The group leader says he
only found 50 handheld launchers.

40:13.295 --> 40:16.765
- And the other 50?
- Missing.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.733
Maybe destroyed in the crash?

40:18.800 --> 40:20.602
What they found was intact.

40:20.669 --> 40:24.139
- Meaning the rest have been stolen.
- Yes, ma'am. They're out there.
