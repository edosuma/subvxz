WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:08.007
- Hey.
- Hey there.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.045
Those magazines
are pretty old, huh?

00:13.047 --> 00:16.582
Well, not according to
"sexiest man alive"
nick nolte.

00:17.717 --> 00:20.119
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.026
Hey, doc.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.794
Who was the skirt?

00:28.796 --> 00:31.730
Why are you talking
like it's 1952?

00:31.732 --> 00:33.699
Well, according to your
"life" magazine out there,

00:33.701 --> 00:36.035
That's current lingo.

00:36.037 --> 00:39.371
Her name is erica.
She owns the little
gift shop downstairs.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.807
She's the reason why
I asked you to stop by.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.375
<i>I want to bounce</i>
<i>an idea off you.</i>

00:43.377 --> 00:46.478
Erica's situation
is kinda interesting.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.113
She's a virgin.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.416
First time in therapy, huh?

00:50.418 --> 00:53.118
- No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.753
- You don't mean that--
- yes.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.756
- No!
- Yes!

00:57.758 --> 01:01.460
- How old?
- 32.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.396
- Childhood trauma?
- No.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.632
- Religious guilt?
- No.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.834
She's been, like,
really busy?

01:08.836 --> 01:11.103
It's the classic scenario.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.472
She was waiting
to fall in love,

01:13.474 --> 01:16.108
Never did,
and past a certain point

01:16.110 --> 01:18.844
It became embarrassing,
so she just never dealt
with it.

01:18.846 --> 01:22.214
Good god.
A virgin at 22.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.384
- She's 32.
- Good god!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.786
So I've been seeing
erica for over a year

01:27.788 --> 01:29.822
And she's anxious
to sleep with someone.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.790
Really?

01:31.792 --> 01:34.560
The idea is causing
her so much stress

01:34.562 --> 01:37.729
That I talked about
arranging a surrogate.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.699
Interesting.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.569
But I'm afraid that
paying someone

01:43.571 --> 01:45.204
For her first
sexual experience

01:45.206 --> 01:46.872
Might feel
kind of clinical.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.776
Especially if he makes her
wear that little paper gown.

01:50.778 --> 01:54.213
So then I thought--
and I know it's unorthodox--

01:54.215 --> 01:56.882
Maybe I should hook her
up with a friend.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.285
I agree with that, too.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.889
Someone who's
sexually experienced,

02:03.891 --> 02:07.493
Generous in bed,
someone I can trust,
sensitive.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.796
Well, if you got
a friend like that,
then you should use him.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.133
The problem is,
ethically,

02:14.135 --> 02:17.569
I can't just come out
and ask him to do this
for me.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.372
So you shouldn't.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.641
- Thanks for hearing me out.
- Always there for you.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.177
( phone chimes )

02:26.713 --> 02:29.548
It's erica.
I should go over
this with her.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.850
Yeah.
Gotcha.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.219
Hi, erica.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.821
Thanks for calling.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.389
I just conferred
with a colleague,

02:37.391 --> 02:38.891
And hearing it out loud
made me realize

02:38.893 --> 02:42.561
We should definitely
go with a professional sex
surrogate.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.396
( chuckles )

02:44.398 --> 02:45.831
I don't know.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.500
It's not something
they list on the resume.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.903
Though, clearly,
he's making a living with it.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.406
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

02:56.309 --> 02:57.943
Have a great day.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.783
- Erica?
- Hey, I know you.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.786
Hi, I'm charlie.
Dr. Wales sent me.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.889
She told me a bit about
you and your situation

03:10.891 --> 03:13.825
And I thought it'd be
a good time to stop by
and say hi.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.794
Wow, that was really fast.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.962
I just got off
the phone with her.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.830
Well, kate doesn't
mess around.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.833
But I do,
that's why she sent me.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.769
Okay.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.338
So you're the guy?

03:26.340 --> 03:28.807
Yup, I'm the guy.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.909
This is really happening.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.544
It's so strange to me,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.613
But I guess you
do this all the time.

03:34.615 --> 03:38.884
Oh, hey, I have dry spells
like everybody else.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.353
I'm just curious,
when did you first realize

03:41.355 --> 03:42.955
You had a talent for this?

03:42.957 --> 03:45.724
Becky johnson, I guess.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.726
She told all her friends

03:47.728 --> 03:50.696
And I've been pretty busy
ever since.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.964
Referrals, huh?

03:51.966 --> 03:54.433
Okay.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.837
Well, I don't know
if my shop is really
the right place for this.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.572
There's not a lot of space
on the counter.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.407
Yeah, this wouldn't work.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.711
Mostly 'cause
I'm only validated
for another 27 minutes.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.614
Anyway, I thought I'd just
come by and introduce myself

04:08.616 --> 04:10.515
And just make sure
that you're comfortable
with all this.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.751
Honestly,
I'm a little nervous.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.620
But that's why
I want to do this,

04:14.622 --> 04:16.555
So I won't be
nervous anymore.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.990
Good for you.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.325
So how about tonight?

04:20.327 --> 04:22.427
Tonight?
Isn't that kind of quick?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.830
You're 32.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.933
You're right.
Tonight's good.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.836
Great. Great.
I'll just need your address
and we're good to go.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.040
So, was this
your major in college?

04:35.042 --> 04:36.908
Pretty much.

04:36.910 --> 04:39.411
This and frisbee.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.483
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.918
How was venice beach?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.588
Did you get that wax
for your surfboard?

04:49.590 --> 04:52.958
No, they turned the surf shop
into a pot dispensary.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.927
Turns out they've been
selling pot the whole time.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.897
So they just got rid
of the surfboards.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.601
But canvas
did get a tattoo.
Want to show her?

05:02.603 --> 05:04.970
It says "free spirit"
in chinese.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.807
Oh, my god.
That's so beautiful.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.343
I'm glad
you like it, mom,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.645
Because I got one, too.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.014
Oh, my god,
that's horrible.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.751
But you just said that
you thought it was beautiful.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.486
That's different.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.889
He's a grown-up.
He's not my daughter.

05:23.891 --> 05:28.627
And I don't think
he's ever going to apply
for a real job.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.329
How could you
let her do this?

05:30.331 --> 05:32.831
Free spirit.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.800
You know what?
I need a minute.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.969
I have to figure out
how I'm gonna handle
this with your father.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.340
You're both grounded.
You, go to your room.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.642
You, go to your van.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.112
Wow, she was
really bummed.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.815
Maybe we should tell
her these are fake.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.652
No way. She's always
bugging me to loosen up
and take chances.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.854
Now that she thinks
I did this, we've got
to let her live with it.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.689
Please,
just one more day.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.759
I get it.
I pulled a prank on
my parents one time.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.627
I told them I was
dropping out of school

06:02.629 --> 06:04.896
And I was gonna
live in my car.

06:06.432 --> 06:10.736
Oh, my god.
My whole life's
been a prank.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.038
That's awesome.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.110
I understand you're looking
for an intimacy specialist

06:18.112 --> 06:20.078
For a 32-year-old virgin.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.547
Yes, and you come
highly recommended.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.384
You know, I was wavering
between going with you

06:25.386 --> 06:28.587
And a layperson,
which ironically sounds

06:28.589 --> 06:31.123
A lot like what you do.
( laughs )

06:32.959 --> 06:35.394
Let's move on.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.095
Thank god you didn't
choose a layperson.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.997
Because that could
be disastrous.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.967
Someone who hasn't been
trained properly

06:41.969 --> 06:44.002
Might cause a sexually
repressed woman

06:44.004 --> 06:46.004
To form unhealthy
attachments

06:46.006 --> 06:49.007
By being, say,
overly romantic.

06:52.645 --> 06:56.114
Wow. Erica,
you look beautiful.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.618
Oh, my god.
This is so romantic.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.655
Well, then I am doing
everything right.

07:09.695 --> 07:12.197
I am not a racist.
I just made a joke.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.865
( laughs )

07:13.867 --> 07:15.634
How did we even
end up on guns?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.169
We were talking about
the weather.

07:17.171 --> 07:21.006
You give ed any topic
and he can get to guns
in six moves.

07:21.008 --> 07:24.209
It's cloudy outside.
Clouds make rain.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.545
Dustin hoffman
played rain man.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.079
Dustin hoffman's a jew.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.848
All jews are liberals.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.783
Liberals want to
take away my guns.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.685
Ha, I did it in five.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.822
Now do cotton candy.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.957
Cotton candy?
I love cotton candy.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.060
Anybody who tries
to take away my cotton candy

07:42.062 --> 07:44.830
Gets shot with my gun.
One.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.132
Hey, guys.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.734
Patrick, can I talk
to you for a second?

07:49.736 --> 07:52.604
Look, I have a big problem.
Sam came home with a tattoo.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.873
I've got to get it removed
before charlie's head explodes.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.709
It's not a tattoo
of charlie's head
exploding, is it?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.811
'cause that would
be a real coincidence.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.215
Look, you told me once
you had a tattoo removed.

08:03.217 --> 08:05.050
I need a referral.
Who did it?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.918
Oh, my god.
Don't do it.
It is too painful

08:06.920 --> 08:08.119
And it never
comes out right.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.489
Doesn't it
just disappear?

08:10.491 --> 08:12.757
Kind of.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.529
Oh, look,
it left a mark.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.568
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.538
You know that feeling
where you've done something
good for somebody

08:26.540 --> 08:29.841
And you got
a little something good
out of it, too?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.677
Yeah, I did something
really good for erica.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.913
Yeah, you did.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.916
Oh, did I tell you
I met with dr. Higgins

08:37.918 --> 08:39.818
And he's gonna be her
sex surrogate?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.754
Dr. Who-gins?

08:42.756 --> 08:46.091
- Higgins.
- What happened with just
going with a friend?

08:46.093 --> 08:48.793
Yeah, I was thinking
of asking my friend miguel.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.996
Who?

08:50.998 --> 08:53.565
( sighs )
thank god I didn't.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.901
I realized you have to go
with a professional

08:55.903 --> 08:57.869
Or else it could be
a real disaster.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.773
Disaster?
I'm sure the guy would
have been very romantic.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.208
Yeah, that's exactly
the problem.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.544
A professional sex surrogate
knows just what to do

09:05.546 --> 09:08.547
To keep the client from
getting emotionally attached.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.715
Obviously.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.819
An amateur might have
brought her flowers and wine

09:14.821 --> 09:17.556
And carried her
into the bedroom.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.060
Ugh, can you imagine?

09:22.062 --> 09:23.862
Pretty clearly.

09:25.965 --> 09:29.000
So, I'm sorry,
I changed the subject.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.570
You were talking
about that feeling

09:31.572 --> 09:33.338
When you do something
good for someone.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.006
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was just gonna say

09:35.008 --> 09:38.677
How quickly that feeling
just goes away.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.848
Charlie:
<i>You don't understand,</i>
<i>michael.</i>

09:43.850 --> 09:45.884
I deflowered somebody
else's virgin.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.253
I parked my car
in a red zone.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.890
And she's 32?
That's crazy.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.626
I mean,
23 and four months

09:54.628 --> 09:56.861
Has got to be about
average, right?

09:56.863 --> 09:59.030
23 is fine.
The four months, though,

09:59.032 --> 10:00.932
I'd keep that part
to yourself.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.301
I've always wanted
to make love to a virgin.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.004
Someone with nothing
to compare me to.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.206
I don't know.
First time I ate
brussels sprouts,

10:08.208 --> 10:10.241
I knew I hated them.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.843
Why do I even
come over here?

10:11.845 --> 10:14.346
I never leave
feeling better
than when I arrive.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.815
I just wanted her first time
to be really special.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.918
By bringing romance into it,
I created an emotional bond.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.820
And now it's going
to blow up in my face.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.688
So you think
she's gonna be clingy

10:23.690 --> 10:25.924
And follow you around
like a baby duck?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.959
Man,
you have got some ego.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.729
( knocks )

10:30.731 --> 10:32.964
Oh, my god.
It's the duck.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.133
( whispers )
one minute.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.735
What should I do?

10:36.737 --> 10:39.137
I would ride
that for as much sex
as I possibly could

10:39.139 --> 10:40.972
<i>Until it blew up</i>
<i>in my face.</i>

10:40.974 --> 10:42.841
And then
I'd crawl weeping

10:42.843 --> 10:45.176
From the emotional
wreckage.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.646
It's not my advice,
it's just what I'd do.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.381
Do me a favor.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.983
Take this into the group.
Tell them I'll be right there.

10:51.985 --> 10:56.655
They'll spend the first
five minutes bitching to
each other about the muffins.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.159
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.394
I didn't know
if you'd be home.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.796
I was just gonna leave
this here for you.

11:04.798 --> 11:08.933
Wow, a flower,
a note,

11:08.935 --> 11:12.771
And you found out
where I live.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.239
I hope I didn't
cross the line.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.141
I just wanted to come
and thank you

11:16.143 --> 11:18.209
For helping me
lose my virginity

11:18.211 --> 11:20.311
And for being
so sweet about it.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.748
Turns out they don't
make a card for that.

11:23.750 --> 11:27.285
Yet they make
get-well cards for cats.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.821
"heard you had a meowie."

11:32.258 --> 11:35.226
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you

11:35.228 --> 11:37.896
That I know what last night
was and I don't expect

11:37.898 --> 11:40.765
To see you again,
but that it was
really great.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.335
So good work.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.304
That's all
you're here for?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.173
Yeah.
That was it.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.474
Well, take care.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.743
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.712
There's something
I got to tell you.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.149
I'm not a professional
sex surrogate.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.251
What?

12:00.253 --> 12:02.487
I'm a therapist.
I'm a colleague of kate's.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.422
Last night was
my first time, too.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.491
As a sex surrogate?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.794
Oh, yeah, obviously
not the other part.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.830
Wow.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.131
Okay.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.133
Let me just process this.

12:15.135 --> 12:18.803
You know what?
It's actually a relief.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.505
I mean, when I thought
you were a professional,

12:20.507 --> 12:23.308
I was afraid you'd slept
with tons of women.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.311
Yeah.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.185
So if you're not
a surrogate,

12:34.187 --> 12:36.287
Does that mean

12:36.289 --> 12:38.089
We're allowed to keep
seeing each other?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.125
How the hell would I know?
I'm not a professional.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.862
I would love to.
I'm just not sure kate would
be too thrilled about it.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.030
Why does kate
have to know?

12:47.500 --> 12:49.968
First the sex,
then the secrets.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.302
What's next?

12:52.304 --> 12:54.205
Anything you want.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.908
Wow. They should
make a card for that.

13:01.247 --> 13:04.082
So how much do you
charge for a belt?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.950
I don't charge.
I barter.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.187
Yesterday,
I traded one
for a dog.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.856
And then I traded the dog
for a guitar.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.092
And then the guitar
for a dog leash.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.960
What do you need
the leash for?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.029
To walk the dog.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.899
Oh, bummer.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.336
Oh, hey,
beauty.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.438
I just saved
both your asses.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.975
Thank you so much.
What are you talking about?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.280
Oh, my god.
You got a tattoo?

13:35.282 --> 13:38.516
Damn right I did.
Mine says "sacrifice."

13:38.518 --> 13:40.952
Now I can tell your dad
it was my idea

13:40.954 --> 13:42.353
That we all got
matching tattoos.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.988
He'll be mad at me,
not you.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.424
And he won't strangle you
with one of your belts.

13:48.260 --> 13:50.829
Okay, what's going on?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.598
Uh, beauty, I...

13:53.600 --> 13:54.866
( inhales )

13:54.868 --> 13:57.035
I have a truth
to share.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.971
- Our tattoos
are fake, mom.
- What?!

13:59.973 --> 14:02.207
I was doing it
to try to make a point

14:02.209 --> 14:04.375
About you accepting
me as I am.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.877
I'm so sorry.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.879
My tattoo's real.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.981
It's gonna be there
forever.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.884
And it's not even tinker bell
wearing a cowboy hat,

14:12.886 --> 14:14.886
Which is what
I always wanted.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.856
We can go back
and you can get that one

14:17.858 --> 14:19.357
And I'll get a real one
just like you.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.993
You think I want you walking
around like some slut

14:21.995 --> 14:24.963
With a tattoo on the back
of your neck?

14:24.965 --> 14:26.297
Oh, my god.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.636
- ( knocks )
- ready for lunch?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.905
It is gorgeous outside.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.940
I just saw a dove
kissing a butterfly.

14:35.942 --> 14:38.042
He was probably eating it.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.946
It's possible.
I mean, I was dead wrong

14:41.948 --> 14:44.983
About that cheetah playing
tag with the gazelle
on animal planet.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.086
Boy, in africa,
when you're it, you're it.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.355
- ( scoffs )
- what's going on with you?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.157
You know that sensitive
professional surrogate

14:53.159 --> 14:55.627
- I hired for erica?
- I've got to go.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.963
That low-life bastard
is dating her now.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.633
- How do you know that?
- I just talked to erica
on the phone.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.935
She's dating someone now,
but she won't tell me
who it is.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.436
Who else can it be?

15:05.438 --> 15:08.573
Can you believe
how unethical that jerk is?

15:08.575 --> 15:11.009
Hell, yeah.
It's totally unethical.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.077
For a professional
surrogate.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.280
I'm gonna file a report
with the apa.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.682
No, no, no, no.
You know what would
be better?

15:17.684 --> 15:20.251
Don't talk to him.
Don't even read his e-mails.
That'll teach him.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.487
- ( knocks )
- kate, I just got
your message.

15:22.489 --> 15:27.258
How dare you take advantage
of one of my patients?

15:27.260 --> 15:30.428
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, so you're the guy.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.431
I got a few things to say
to you, mister.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.301
Kate, would you
give us a minute?

15:36.303 --> 15:38.303
- It's my office.
- You're right.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.271
We'll leave.
Come on, buddy.
Let's go.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.007
No,
I'll take care of this.

15:43.009 --> 15:46.945
Do you have any idea
what an ethical violation

15:46.947 --> 15:48.947
It is for you
to be dating erica?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.982
Dating?
I haven't even
called her yet.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.450
That's a lie.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.319
Yeah, you can't just come in
here with all your lies.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.021
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.190
Now get out of here
and never contact kate again.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.192
I'm gonna call
the ethics board
right now.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.660
Now hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
Don't do that.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.662
Let's just try to look
at this subjectively.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.197
You mean objectively.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.666
No, that's not
gonna help.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.002
All right, let's say
that he is dating her.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.503
I'm not dating her.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.640
Will you shut up?
I'm trying to help you here.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.010
A relationship with
a healthy man like this

16:19.012 --> 16:22.180
Following a sexual awakening
might be the best thing that
ever happened to her.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.983
And a real feather
in your cap.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.019
- Charlie.
- Yeah?

16:28.021 --> 16:31.322
What's going on?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.224
I'll tell you
what's going on.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.094
First of all,
you look beautiful.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.396
I should have said
something when I walked in,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.665
- But, hey, it's never
too late to say--
- what is it, charlie?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.301
- Yeah, what is it?
- Shut up!

16:46.006 --> 16:50.008
Have you ever accidentally
slept with someone before?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.442
No.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.045
You are really not
helping here, pal.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.350
I am so sorry about
the misunderstanding.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.220
- I will call you tomorrow.
- You should report this guy.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.023
Shut up.
You're one step away
from being a whore.

17:09.495 --> 17:12.363
How could you sleep
with my patient?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.033
Your directions
were very confusing.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.068
Sometimes the way
you phrase things,

17:17.070 --> 17:20.738
It sounds like
you want me to have sex
with your patients.

17:22.107 --> 17:25.043
You have no idea
the problems
you've caused.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.744
She actually thinks
she's gonna keep dating you.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.347
We are gonna keep dating.
We have fun together.

17:29.349 --> 17:33.117
In fact, I happen to know
I'm the best lover
she's ever had.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.154
Okay, you misunderstood
me before,

17:36.156 --> 17:37.688
So I'm gonna be
very clear on this.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.059
I do not want you
dating erica.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.395
Kate, I'm a therapist.
I understand the pitfalls.
But I like her.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.831
- It won't work.
- Why not?

17:46.833 --> 17:49.801
Because you can't put
a woman who just got
her driver's permit

17:49.803 --> 17:53.604
Behind the wheel of a guy
who's banged a million women.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.408
Wow. I didn't think
you were gonna pull off

17:57.410 --> 17:59.177
The metaphor,
but you actually did.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.216
So how did you
lose your virginity?

18:05.218 --> 18:07.752
Baseball camp.
There was one girl
on the team

18:07.754 --> 18:10.488
And every day she wanted to
prove she was one of the guys.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.624
And then one night
she decided to prove
that she wasn't.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.826
( laughs )

18:18.097 --> 18:19.497
Good-looking guy, huh?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.765
What? No.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.834
I'm just thinking about
what I wanted to order.

18:22.836 --> 18:24.836
Erica, it's okay.
This is all new to you.

18:24.838 --> 18:29.107
To be with another
super handsome guy.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.875
No, not at all.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.877
( man moans )

18:32.879 --> 18:35.513
I feel like having meat.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.883
- What?
- For dinner.

18:38.885 --> 18:43.387
Erica, I'm not threatened.
It's perfectly natural

18:43.389 --> 18:45.790
For an attractive
person to look at other
attractive people.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.860
Yeah, like that
tall guy over there.

18:48.862 --> 18:51.762
I bet I'd feel so small
and helpless next to him.

18:51.764 --> 18:54.832
( sighs )
okay, we need to talk.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.869
Here's what's happening.
You just had your first steak.

18:57.871 --> 19:02.240
And it was really good.
I'm talking five stars on yelp.

19:03.775 --> 19:07.378
And pretty soon you'll be
curious about indian food

19:07.380 --> 19:09.780
And italian food and...

19:09.782 --> 19:13.151
( sighs )
whatever the hell kind
of food that guy is.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.522
- And that's healthy.
- Is it?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.825
I just think since
I've shut myself off to men
for so long,

19:20.827 --> 19:24.262
Now it's like they're half
the population or something.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.498
It's a shame,
because you're really great.

19:28.433 --> 19:29.700
What are you saying?

19:29.702 --> 19:33.404
I'm saying that
this won't work.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.805
You shouldn't be
tied down by me.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.542
You should be tied down
by lots of guys.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.177
- But I really like you.
- And I like you, too.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.444
But trust me,
you need to get out there

19:40.446 --> 19:42.780
And experience
all kinds of people.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.883
And once you've gotten
that out of your system,
if you're still interested,

19:45.885 --> 19:48.786
Get tested
and come back to me.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.790
So you got this thing

19:52.792 --> 19:55.626
To keep me from
killing canvas?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.662
Yeah, when I thought
he took sam

19:57.664 --> 19:59.730
To get a tattoo,
I overreacted.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.433
No, you got it right.
I would have strangled him
with one of his legs

20:02.435 --> 20:05.203
And then made it
look like a yoga accident.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.339
Hey.
Hey, dig the new tattoo.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.808
Thanks.
It's a long story.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.545
You know, I spent
a few months studying
in shanghai.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.215
Why does it say
"sack of rice"?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.382
What?

20:18.384 --> 20:20.551
It's supposed to
say "sacrifice."

20:20.553 --> 20:22.853
Damn it!

20:24.456 --> 20:26.290
So, you wanted
to talk to me?

20:26.292 --> 20:28.359
Yes. Yes.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.761
I just wanted
you to know

20:30.763 --> 20:33.864
That I thought about
what you said,

20:33.866 --> 20:36.000
So I broke it off
with erica.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.735
It was the right thing
to do.

20:37.737 --> 20:41.572
So she left you to take
a tour of bonertown, right?

20:41.574 --> 20:44.242
Yup.
She's on a cockabout.
