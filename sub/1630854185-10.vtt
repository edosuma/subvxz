00:03.837 --> 00:05.406
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:05.506 --> 00:07.275
Three cases we've worked on
in the last few weeks?

00:07.375 --> 00:09.543
<i>They're all connected.</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:10.544
Richard
Sloan? Anyone home?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.413
Stop!

00:13.781 --> 00:15.216
Sloan's being manipulated
by somebody.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.318
I mean, odds are it's the same
person behind all of it.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.353
<i>A guy told me
that you were attacked,</i>

00:19.453 --> 00:21.222
<i>put in the hospital
and nearly died.</i>

00:21.322 --> 00:23.591
You sleeping okay?
Since your attack?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.693
<i>I know nights can be
the hardest part.</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:27.395
You're the most important
person in my life here.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.263
But you're
with Chavez now.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.899
We can't be friends.

Guys, we have to get these
dance moves down by tonight.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.703
This dance is gonna be
dead by Monday.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.572
Let's go.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.443
All right, ready?

01:15.543 --> 01:17.077
Three, two...

01:17.178 --> 01:18.612
one!

01:18.712 --> 01:19.947
Aah!

01:20.047 --> 01:22.616

01:58.586 --> 02:01.455
That is a lot of blood.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.591
Halfway to a paint job.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.730
Maybe we'll catch a break,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.599
and this guy live-streamed
his own murder.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.602
You never know.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.205
Something
Nateorious would do.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.240
The vic, @ItsNateorious?

02:19.340 --> 02:20.708
I'm not familiar.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.876
I knew I liked you.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.446
Nate and his friends,
the kids who found him,

02:25.546 --> 02:27.781
they're all social
media influencers.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.983
Basically, professional narcissists.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.186
You sure none of them
are lumberjacks?

02:35.022 --> 02:36.424
Boy.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.026
Somebody really didn't
like this guy.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.629
That looks like at least
four deep slashes

02:41.729 --> 02:43.030
to the throat.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.932
Empty solo cup.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.067
I wonder if he was passed out
when they got him.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.603
Would explain the lack
of defensive wounds.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.873
Well, could be bruising
we can't see.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.610
I'm gonna switch to infrared
for a sub-dermal look.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.150
No bruising on the
hands or forearms.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.089
Serena?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.395
Oh, man.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.029
That's not good.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.898
All right, maybe
this is something.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.068
Unsolved homicide
in Henderson.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.272
Case number 16-90030.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.873
Housewife's head
got smashed

03:25.973 --> 03:28.041
into a full-length
mirror in 2016.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.977
Hmm, it's a little dusty.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.313
Do you think there's some
connection one of our perps

03:32.413 --> 03:33.714
or victims
from the Silver Ink cases?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.483
Nothing solid, but...

03:35.583 --> 03:37.017
mirror as a murder weapon.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.919
Shades of Alan Herskovitz.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.088
I mean, it's
worth a look.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.356
Uh, Allie?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.724
Isn't this
your day off?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.726
Yeah. I just,
I thought I'd come in

03:45.826 --> 03:47.227
and look for some new leads.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.297
See if there's any related cases
we might find.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.398
And did you find any?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.032
Nope.
Okay.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.701
So you go home,
you come with me.
Boss, can I just--

03:53.801 --> 03:55.869
Allie, I appreciate
your hard work.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.771
But we don't have
an open case.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.773
It's been three weeks

03:59.873 --> 04:01.642
and I need you working
on active files.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.210
And I need you rested.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.713
Personally, I find
this place very peaceful.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.082
Okay, stay.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.418
Hey, come on.

04:10.518 --> 04:11.985
Where to?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.654
Joshua caught a juicy
one in Green Valley.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.789
And he asked
for you by name.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.301
Somebody call
for the cavalry?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.136
Something like that.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.639
Heard I was your first choice.
I'm flattered.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.974
This one has Chris
written all over it.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.377
Blood spatter central
and it's very reminiscent

04:36.477 --> 04:37.945
of one of your
how-to videos.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.747
This about your
@Chrissolves thingy?

04:39.847 --> 04:41.882
Hey, it's just
a side hustle.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.418
Slice of CSI life,
forensics I find cool.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.888
I never post about anything
confidential or sensitive.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.657
No big deal.
Don't
undersell it, Chris.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.626
It's getting to be a big deal.
How big?

04:58.165 --> 05:00.133
You've got a hundred
thousand followers?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.269
112,126.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.271
How much time you
spending on this?

05:04.372 --> 05:07.040
None at work, I swear.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.942
Chavez really enjoyed "What To
Expect When Dating a CSI."

05:09.042 --> 05:10.711
Thanks for that.
All right.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.713
So you asked for him
specifically. Why?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.048
Because the
killer did, too.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.357
You're gonna want
to see this.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.996
Killer wrote your
handle in... something.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.465
It really pops
under black light.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.300
Sodium carbonate.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.969
I did a post on
invisible ink last week.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.005
Somebody's been
paying attention.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.674
And now they want you
to pay attention to them.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.110
It's worse
than you think.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.080
I know this guy.

Boss, please.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.723
You got to let me
work this case.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.460
The killer wrote your name
on the victim's face.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.794
What if he'd written
all of our names?

06:33.894 --> 06:35.295
Would the entire crime lab
be disqualified?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.830
That's a nice way
to get away with murder.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.298
Man has a point.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.300
No, he doesn't.
The victim, Nate?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.935
It's not like
I knew him personally.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.637
I knew of him, but, then again,

06:43.737 --> 06:45.272
a lot of people do.
He has close

06:45.372 --> 06:46.807
to three million followers.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.677
<i>Had</i> close to three
million followers.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.445
I guess we
can't have killers

06:51.545 --> 06:53.447
kicking us off
cases, huh?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.716
You can work it, but
you're riding shotgun.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.518
You're point. Come on,
what's going on here?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.921
Tell me about Mr. Popular
and all his friends.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.322
I think it's some sort of...

07:02.422 --> 07:04.858
weird revenge thing.
Four years ago,

07:04.958 --> 07:07.060
Nate was charged with killing
a woman with an axe.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.529
I knew his name
sounded familiar.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.030
Not me.
I was in Chicago.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.165
My whole class at the academy
was, like, obsessed

07:12.265 --> 07:13.767
with the entire trial.
It was Nate

07:13.867 --> 07:15.803
and his roommate, Warren,
who were accused.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.772
Two young guys like me--
you know, "extremely online."

07:18.872 --> 07:20.608
Cops said that they killed
their neighbor.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.543
Ana Reynolds.
Someone slashed her throat.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.478
Just like today.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.713
Warren's boot
prints were found

07:25.813 --> 07:27.347
in Ana's yard.
Mm-hmm.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.550
Nate's camping axe turned
up in the dishwasher.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.085
Bleached.
They said that the stab wounds

07:32.185 --> 07:34.522
matched the axe's
pick end, but...

07:34.622 --> 07:36.524
They beat a murder charge.

07:36.624 --> 07:39.392
I might've had a little
something to do with that.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.394
I, uh, made a video
about the murder

07:41.495 --> 07:43.163
and it sort of went viral.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.498
How do you "sort of" go viral?

07:44.598 --> 07:46.399
Fine. It completely blew up.
Show me.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.636
Come on, show me.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.371
Axe murders are crazy and nasty

07:51.471 --> 07:53.406
and out of control.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.009
But the castoff is
way more boring

07:56.109 --> 07:57.711
and predictable,
and nothing like

07:57.811 --> 07:59.647
what we saw
in the leaked crime photos.

07:59.747 --> 08:03.250
The cops found blood ten feet
above Ms. Reynolds.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.686
Why? How'd it get there?

08:05.786 --> 08:08.188
No way an axe did that, chief.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.790
Nothing in this case adds up.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.825
I don't think
Nate and Warren did it.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.661
You posted

08:13.761 --> 08:15.796
about an ongoing murder trial?

08:15.896 --> 08:18.766
There are rules
about this exact thing.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.934
Wait, this was
before I was a CSI.
Yeah, but look.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.236
You're still posting.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.572
I mean, like...
like, a ton of them.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.574
Never about an ongoing case.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.775
Not since you hired me.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.777
Look, I was right.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.746
A few days after I posted this,
I got DM'd by Greg Sanders.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.215
I remember Greg.
I mean, did you two

08:35.315 --> 08:36.650
overlap at the lab?

08:36.750 --> 08:38.151
He left before I started,
but the point is,

08:38.251 --> 08:40.253
he had a lot of the same
questions about Ana's case.

08:40.353 --> 08:42.355
But the D.A. was overzealous.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.824
Took the whole thing
to trial before

08:43.924 --> 08:45.392
anyone could figure out
what really happened.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.194
But you figured out
what didn't happen.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.630
Nate and Warren's lawyers actually

08:49.730 --> 08:51.498
used my theory in court.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.200
It's probably what got them
the acquittal.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.403
I got a lot of flak
from other armchair detectives,

08:56.503 --> 08:57.470
but I was right.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.606
An axe like this

08:58.706 --> 09:00.708
just does not explain

09:00.808 --> 09:02.576
the spatter around Ana Reynolds.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.377
What, is that
the same type of axe?

09:04.477 --> 09:05.512
Actually, I-I...

09:05.613 --> 09:07.514
I think it's the exact same axe.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.716
No.
You think he just had

09:08.816 --> 09:10.651
it lying around,
his old murder weapon?

09:10.751 --> 09:12.252
<i>Alleged</i> murder weapon.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.487
I just do not like
the look of this.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.123
A vengeance killing.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.858
Someone mad at you
about a trial.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.426
We are talking
about something that,

09:19.526 --> 09:22.162
that could be dangerous
for you, Chris.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.765
Nobody knows Nate Taylor's
case better than I do.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.400
LVPD will review
your social media.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.503
And, uh, if they find anything--
They won't.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.574
Okay, you two keep
processing up here.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.209
And I'll make sure
we're collecting

09:36.309 --> 09:38.612
DNA from Nate's housemates.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.916
You know, I never needed
a reason to avoid social media,

09:43.016 --> 09:45.953
but I... appreciate you
inventing a new one.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.791
So, like, physically,
I was here last night.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.994
But psychically,
I was on a whole other plane.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.996
Yeah. I've read about
astral projection.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.166
I don't think it's widely
recognized as a viable alibi.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.436
Uh, fair warning, my dude,
my DNA is copyright protected.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.538
Like, legally.

10:05.639 --> 10:08.575
I'm not sure how to respond
to that, either.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.611
Warren, you let us know

10:11.712 --> 10:13.613
when we have your attention, huh?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.449
You got to get
those likes, huh, Warren?

10:16.549 --> 10:18.585
My best friend was
just murdered.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.420
Okay? Nate was, like...

10:20.520 --> 10:22.189
he was, like, a legend.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.857
I'm devastated.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.458
And I have to share my pain.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.327
Emotional honesty,
that's my brand.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.096
Does your brand have an alibi?

10:29.196 --> 10:30.397
Yeah, I was out last night.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.899
So we had this little pre-party

10:31.999 --> 10:33.500
at the new club
at the Bellagio.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.568
I got so messed up
that by the time

10:35.669 --> 10:37.604
we got back,
I-I missed our own shindig.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.172
I went straight to bed.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.640
That's not exactly an alibi.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.410
Okay, fine, but...

10:43.510 --> 10:45.746
it's the truth.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.517
I didn't think you'd be
a wristband buddy.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.619
Come on, what club were you at?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
Oh, this isn't
from a club.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.289
I got hit on the head
a while back.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.992
It's a nasty business,
trying to cover up for murder.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.696
So I was partying
at WLVU Medical Center.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.765
But, hey, better drugs there.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.266
Uh, let's get specific, Warren.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.401
What time did you get home
last night?
Uh...

11:08.501 --> 11:10.403
probably like...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.072
lawyer o'clock.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.506
Excuse me?

11:13.606 --> 11:15.675
I've been through this before.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.577
Okay?
You've probably heard about me.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.148
I'm Warren Bart.
I was falsely accused of murder.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.083
I'm zipping my lips.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.853
I'm not saying another word
without my attorney present.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.324
Thanks, gents.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.795
Honestly, I don't see how
anyone could've done this.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.663
Look.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.332
Those footprints are Nate's,

11:39.432 --> 11:41.134
we made the rest, but the
killer didn't leave any?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.170
How is that possible?
It gets weirder.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.538
Look at the spatter pattern,
what do you see?

11:45.638 --> 11:48.341
Uh, blood. Everywhere.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.978
<i>You'd expect to see
a break in the blood</i>

11:51.078 --> 11:53.847
<i>where the killer
was standing, right?</i>

11:53.947 --> 11:56.149
But there's no break.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.650
There's no void.

11:57.751 --> 11:58.919
Almost as if Nate was alone

11:59.019 --> 12:00.754
on the balcony
when his throat was slit.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.389
Right. So how does
a killer leave behind

12:02.489 --> 12:03.924
a murder weapon
and a body,

12:04.024 --> 12:06.159
but not a single trace
that he was ever here?

12:06.259 --> 12:08.095
I don't know.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.497
It's like he was
killed by Batman.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.707
Oh.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.676
Sorry to interrupt.
I-I just, I'm expecting some...

12:23.777 --> 12:25.178
It's okay.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
You work here.
You don't have to apologize.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.018
Hey, Beau told me

12:31.118 --> 12:33.220
that you guys got
to meet some e-celebs

12:33.320 --> 12:34.922
whilst you was out on the scene.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.057
Must have been exciting for you.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.028
Well, I quit Myspace
and never looked back.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.530
Sometimes I forget
you're kind of ancient.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.371
Oh.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.506
It's all Nate's blood.
If the killer got nicked

12:53.606 --> 12:55.008
swinging that axe,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.844
he didn't leave
any on the blade.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.512
There's no prints either.
Really?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.282
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a second.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.783
Wait,
go back to your left.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.585
What are those
white crystals?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.654
Sort of looks like salt.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.757
Do you think the killer
could've sweat onto the axe?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.725
Gloves don't cover
the whole arm.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.097
If there's sweat,
there's DNA.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.903
Thanks.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.273
So you're
as millennial as Chris.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.475
You hiding some secret

13:28.575 --> 13:30.310
internet following, too?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.079
I lurk.
I browse.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.646
But nope.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.615
I'd rather not have my life

13:35.715 --> 13:37.550
under the scope for everyone.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.519
I don't see
the attraction.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.753
I guess Chris does.

13:40.854 --> 13:41.989
He wanted to be an influencer

13:42.089 --> 13:43.723
before he put the lab coat on.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.459
I think...
I think he likes the attention.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.761
<i>In case you're living</i>

13:48.862 --> 13:50.297
<i>under a rock, @ChrisSolves</i>

13:50.397 --> 13:53.566
may finally be taking the L
he so richly deserves.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.237
Now some of us have always known
that Warren Bart is a killer.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.873
We didn't need him dropping
a second body to confirm that.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.175
But not @ChrisSolves,
no, you see, he is dedicated

14:02.275 --> 14:04.411
to once again
helping the guilty.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.115
Not sure that's the healthiest
use of your time, my friend.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.684
Nate's murder is trending.
And everyone's talking

14:11.784 --> 14:13.520
about the old
Ana Reynolds case again.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.022
This is why I tell my
daughters they'll get a car

14:15.122 --> 14:16.789
before they get Instagram.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.525
Don't you think that'll
just make them want it more?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.560
That's what spyware is for. Oh.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.962
You're that dad.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.297
♪ThatDad.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.866
Wait, I got to go.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.768
Allie ID'd the guy
who sweat on the axe handle.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.270
Really?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.738
Well, who was it?

14:31.838 --> 14:33.540
Okay, Warren.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.943
Why was your sweat
on that camping axe?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.411
Sorry, Dr. Roby, but the scope

14:38.511 --> 14:41.848
of your warrant is limited
to a blood draw.

14:41.949 --> 14:44.651
My client isn't compelled
to answer any of your questions.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.653
I thought he'd like
a chance to explain why the axe

14:46.753 --> 14:49.589
that was at the center
of the Ana Reynolds murder case

14:49.689 --> 14:50.890
was still
in his house.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.692
I appreciate
your curiosity.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.327
But he's not answering
any questions.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.564
You folks falsely accused him
once before.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.432
If Ms. Willows was in town
to explain herself--

14:59.532 --> 15:02.602
It doesn't matter.
What matters is you have

15:02.702 --> 15:04.471
what you need,
and we're leaving.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.905
Mr. Bart.
Wait, wait.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.340
Warren, wait.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.311
We're trying to find the person
that killed your best friend.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.580
I know you can help us.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.482
No, you need to help me, dude.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.984
You found me
innocent once.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.352
You got to do it again.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.255
I didn't kill Nate.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.656
Then who did?

15:23.756 --> 15:24.891
I don't know.
I don't. Dude...

15:24.992 --> 15:26.793
My client has nothing more
to offer.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.895
You have his DNA
on an implement

15:28.996 --> 15:30.630
you found in his house.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.432
That's all you have.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
That's all you'll ever have.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.569
He's innocent.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.905
We'll see.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.111
I can tell you one thing
about this killer.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.213
He hates subclavian arteries.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.481
This one got severed
in four different places.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.283
Hmm. Brutal.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.453
Extremely. You want
to see something wild?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.523
The blood vessels
in his conjunctiva flared.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.391
That's... wild?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.460
Well, it's not every day
you see trauma so pronounced

16:00.560 --> 16:03.230
that it enflames
the membrane over the eye.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.370
There's a new nightmare.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.805
The lack of defensive wounds
is a lot less surprising.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.308
Tox showed
blood alcohol was at 0.185,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.211
and he had 260 milligrams
per liter

16:18.311 --> 16:19.912
of gamma hydroxybutyrate
in his system.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.448
That's a lot of GHB.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.216
If the killer was planning
ahead, maybe he drugged him.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.752
Some people do take
it recreationally.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.355
Ugh. These kids today.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.024
Anyway, I'm just
getting started here.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.194
But barring any surprises,
I think we all know the cause.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.363
The killer struck
Mr. Taylor's neck

16:36.463 --> 16:38.931
with so much force
that it left grooves in

16:39.032 --> 16:42.135
his clavicle and first rib
here and here.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.238
Wounds generally
consistent with an axe.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.939
"Generally consistent"

16:47.040 --> 16:48.375
is not what we're here for.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.044
What? You want to start
with tool mark analysis?

16:51.144 --> 16:53.580
Better we check
the grooves in his bones

16:53.680 --> 16:55.648
before you make
the "Y" incision.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.550
Warren Bart has a great
attorney, and a history

16:57.650 --> 16:59.652
of tap-dancing his way
out of murder charges.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.321
We can't leave any doubt

17:01.421 --> 17:02.589
that those wounds

17:02.689 --> 17:04.257
were inflicted by this axe.
Well, then...

17:04.357 --> 17:06.393
swing away.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.218
Okay.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.520
Let's try
a different angle. Yep.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.288
Sonya?
Yep.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.794
Let's try the other
side of the axe.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.463
Yeah.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.934
It's not a question
of what angle

17:48.034 --> 17:49.068
or what part of the blade.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.171
Nothing matches.
There's no way

17:51.271 --> 17:53.340
that that axe left those marks
on Nate's neck.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.342
But if the axe isn't
the murder weapon, then...

17:55.442 --> 17:57.009
Then the presence
of Warren's sweat

17:57.110 --> 17:59.612
on the handle is irrelevant. No.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.814
I think the sweat being
on there is the whole point.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.418
Warren Bart is being framed.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.487
He's innocent.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.921
Again.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.898
Your friend Warren
is gaining followers.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.767
Are we sure he's being framed?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.835
The tool mark analysis was
as conclusive as can be.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.971
The axe Warren handled
didn't kill Nate.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.807
The sweat on the handle
actually helped his case, too.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.276
How?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.611
The blood that we drew
from Warren has high levels

18:31.711 --> 18:33.646
of HGH and gonane.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.315
Warren's taking steroids?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.716
It's bulking season, I guess.

18:36.816 --> 18:39.186
But neither chemical was present

18:39.286 --> 18:41.654
in his sweat on the axe.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.790
So, whoever left the axe
for us knew

18:43.890 --> 18:45.625
that Warren had touched it
at some point in the past,

18:45.725 --> 18:47.694
and they just figured,
"Good enough."

18:47.794 --> 18:49.829
There's a new one. "I-I couldn't
have done it, Your Honor.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.698
I'm taking
illegal steroids now."

18:51.798 --> 18:55.302
So if Warren's innocent, and
the axe is out, we're nowhere.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.304
We don't even know what kind
of weapon was being used.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.106
That's your domain.
Get to it.
You got it, boss.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.908
You two, the killer knows
a lot about you,

19:02.008 --> 19:04.911
Nate, Warren,
and the Reynolds case.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.813
You better get shopping
online for followers.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.581
You think it's someone
who follows me and Warren?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.683
That's a suspect pool
of thousands of people.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.052
Yup. You better
get started.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.257
The blood drops on the balcony

19:17.357 --> 19:21.228
that we want to replicate were
all smaller than one millimeter.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.764
Whatever the killer was
slicing and dicing with,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.099
it was moving fast.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.735
All right,
hope you stretched, Beau.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.637
Let's figure out what it was.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.462
Grief and pain.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.830
Product placement.
Grief and pain.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.267
I mean, that is a proper
social media sandwich.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.669
Got to pay the bills.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.904
I once shilled for cat food

20:05.004 --> 20:07.139
in a video I made
about the Menendez brothers.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.276
Chris, you're
allergic to cats.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.845
Warren Bart has killed again,
and now, the only question is,

20:12.945 --> 20:16.283
will Chris Park help him
get away with it... again?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.784
Who the hell is this guy?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.952
That's @SleuthVCF.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.755
Kind of like the Lestrade
to my Sherlock Holmes.

20:22.855 --> 20:27.126
Oh. Sherlock would have
a suspect by now, so, uh...

20:27.226 --> 20:28.828
Sorry.
Mm-hmm.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.663
Warren and Nate are still
gaining followers.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.164
For every suspect
we eliminate,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.534
ten more names pop up
that we need to check out.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.336
It's like troll
whack-a-mole.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.871
Well, human tragedy
does bring the boys to the yard.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.673
Take a look at this.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.409
Wow. There's nothing

20:42.509 --> 20:44.777
like a few hundred people
sliding into your DMs.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.779
With pitchforks in hand.

20:46.879 --> 20:49.015
Forgive me, Chris.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.717
I'm gonna have to be
your mom for a second.

20:50.817 --> 20:54.053
Are you out of your damn mind?

20:54.153 --> 20:57.890
You cannot put yourself out
there like this. It's dangerous.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.327
My little corner of the Internet
was never this extreme.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.195
Well, now someone in your
little corner is killing people.

21:04.531 --> 21:07.534
You never know
who is watching you,

21:07.634 --> 21:09.769
or what they are
capable of.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.672
Now, the next Mark David Chapman
could be lurking

21:12.772 --> 21:14.341
in your damn comments.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.509
Who?

21:16.609 --> 21:19.779
Now I'm gonna talk
to you like your boss.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.916
You need to start carrying a
service piece around the clock.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.718
At home, too?
Mm-hmm.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.721
Don't you always say a CSI's
mind is their best weapon?
I do.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.790
But someone threw your name
into the mix.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.226
So I'd say this case requires
more tangible protection.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.329
And I want you safe.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.905
Keep your head up, mate.

21:46.005 --> 21:49.376
I'm not sifting through
this toxic cesspool alone.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.312
And this is the crime scene
from above...

21:53.413 --> 21:54.914
Hey, that's illegal.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.149
You can't film an active
crime scene like that.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.419
Check it out. Okay,
I know I'm breaking the law

21:59.519 --> 22:00.687
by shooting this, but...

22:00.787 --> 22:02.321
Well, at least
she's self-aware.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.725
Don't forget to like, comment.
Love ya.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.962
Aah!

22:13.566 --> 22:15.802
Nope. Uh-uh. Pay up, Beau.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.371
Damn. Thought for sure
it was a power tool.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.873
Not the first time
Bob Vila's let me down.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.143
Now you know how I felt
when the halberd failed.

22:24.243 --> 22:26.278
And the poleax.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.682
You guys find the murder weapon?

22:29.782 --> 22:32.719
No. We are officially out
of weapons and ideas.

22:32.819 --> 22:35.087
Pretty much the only thing that
we haven't tried is that, like,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.790
razor-sharp boomerang
from <i>The Road Warrior.</i>

22:37.890 --> 22:39.892
I know you're joking, but...

22:39.992 --> 22:41.861
you might be closer
than you think.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.497
This was filmed
by the murder weapon.

22:44.597 --> 22:48.034
Hey, Beau, don't drones
have, like, safety features

22:48.134 --> 22:50.770
that stop them from hitting
buildings or... people?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.539
Yeah, those are easy
to override.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.974
First thing I did when I bought
one of these for my daughters.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.244
Was it really
for your kids, Beau?
Yeah.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.780
They love
watching me fly it.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.419
Whoa. Whoa.
I got it.

23:08.054 --> 23:12.692
And that, gentlemen, is how
you make the perfect mess.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.261
No footprints,
no void in the blood.

23:16.863 --> 23:20.500
Because there was no killer
there. We-we got our answer.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.968
Only one of them-- how, not who.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.437
I guess we got to hope
that the killer left a trace

23:24.537 --> 23:26.038
of himself at the house
when he planted the axe.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.574
They'd never need
to get that close.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.275
<i>The largest
commercially-available drones</i>

23:29.375 --> 23:31.778
<i>could carry a tool that size
as payload.</i>

23:33.312 --> 23:35.347
Well, drones like that are
standard tool of the trade

23:35.448 --> 23:36.683
for some influencers.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.350
Doesn't narrow it down much.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.286
I think MurderHouse might be
a good place to start looking.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.420
MurderHouse?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.421
That's what they're calling it.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.590
Some of Nate's roommates

23:43.690 --> 23:44.757
have rebranded.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.026
Who would want
that kind of a brand?

23:47.126 --> 23:49.762
Bro, check out
my first search warrant.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.765
It's just like on TV.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.735
Do you really need
to be filming this?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.870
You better believe it, lady.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.840
Just another day
in MurderHouse.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.374
It's nonstop
over here, man...

24:02.475 --> 24:03.776
This is harassment, okay?

24:03.876 --> 24:05.978
I'm not talking to you guys
without my lawyer.

24:06.078 --> 24:08.180
Well, you don't need
to talk at all.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.749
We just need to see your drone.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.784
I don't own a drone.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.186
You and literally
every one

24:14.286 --> 24:16.055
of your housemates have
posted drone footage.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.890
Someone in this
house has one.

24:19.258 --> 24:23.896
Warren, if it's here, it'll only
take us five minutes to find it.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.801
Forget it.
It won't even take that long.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.347
Hey.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.761
Two minutes
and 45 seconds.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.429
The propellers are damaged.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.131
We got blood.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.467
We got the murder weapon.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.337
Actually...
What?

25:05.437 --> 25:07.540
It's all rusted
where the blade broke.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.276
I don't think this thing's
been air-worthy for a while.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.786
Could you, uh...

25:19.886 --> 25:22.488
hold that, please?

25:28.928 --> 25:32.932
Nate had O positive blood,
but this...

25:33.032 --> 25:35.267
It's not his blood?

25:37.436 --> 25:40.039
Wonder how long
it's been here.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.508
Four years and three months.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.944
That test did not
tell you that.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.980
The woman Nate and Warren
were accused of killing?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.517
She had A positive blood.

25:51.618 --> 25:54.153
That drone didn't kill
Nate Taylor.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.589
It killed Ana Reynolds.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.094
They really did
murder her.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.632
And I helped them
get away with it.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.341
Look at the photos, Warren.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.843
Look at them.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.845
You can't, can you? I get it.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.580
What you did to Ana was...

26:26.218 --> 26:29.722
We found Ana Reynolds's
dried blood on your drone.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.725
Blood leaves DNA,
and DNA leaves no doubt.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.260
He's not going to talk.
How about this?

26:34.360 --> 26:37.129
Why don't you stop me
when I get something wrong?

26:37.229 --> 26:38.597
Around 11:00 a.m...

26:38.698 --> 26:40.466
What is it you're hoping to...
Around 11:00 a.m.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.669
on August 5, 2018,

26:42.769 --> 26:45.004
you took your new
quadcopter drone

26:45.104 --> 26:46.338
out for a spin.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.142
<i>You saw Ana sunbathing</i>

26:50.242 --> 26:52.111
<i>and decided
to get a closer look.</i>

26:52.211 --> 26:53.980
Maybe you wanted to prank her.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.884
I checked. The drone's safety
features were disabled.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.487
<i>That allowed you
to get way, way too close.</i>

27:03.756 --> 27:05.658
When you ran into Ana's yard,

27:05.758 --> 27:08.094
<i>she was bleeding out, dying.</i>

27:08.194 --> 27:10.029
<i>But instead of calling 911,
you panicked.</i>

27:10.129 --> 27:12.398
<i>You didn't want her telling
the cops what happened,</i>

27:12.498 --> 27:13.800
<i>so you finished the job yourself</i>

27:13.900 --> 27:16.202
<i>with Nate's camping axe.</i>

27:16.302 --> 27:17.503
Perhaps Mr. Taylor...

27:17.603 --> 27:19.038
You ransacked Ana's house

27:19.138 --> 27:21.407
to make it look like a robbery,
you washed the axe

27:21.507 --> 27:22.842
to destroy the evidence.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.410
I want to know why
you kept the damn drone.

27:24.510 --> 27:25.577
I don't own a drone!
Warren.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.713
No, that's right.

27:26.813 --> 27:27.880
We found it
in Nate's closet.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.081
He's the one
who kept it.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.717
Well, that's telling.
It tells me

27:30.817 --> 27:32.685
that by the time
Nate found out what happened,

27:32.785 --> 27:34.486
he was already charged
with murder.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.955
Your fates
were tied together.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.690
Maybe he kept it
for leverage.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.291
Is that what
this was all about, Warren?

27:39.391 --> 27:44.030
CSIs only found your footprints
in Ana's yard, Warren.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.866
Was Nate even there?

27:46.966 --> 27:49.368
Or did you just let
your best friend stand trial

27:49.468 --> 27:51.470
for murder with you
to save yourself?

27:51.570 --> 27:52.705
Was he threatening
to come forward

27:52.805 --> 27:53.906
about what really happened?

27:54.006 --> 27:55.407
Is that why you killed him?

27:55.507 --> 27:56.976
Even if this story was true--

27:57.076 --> 27:59.345
which, for the record,
it is not--

27:59.445 --> 28:01.213
my client
can't be charged.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.315
He's protected
by double jeopardy.
Your client

28:03.415 --> 28:04.751
killed Ana Reynolds.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.786
Mr. Bart was acquitted
of those charges,

28:06.886 --> 28:10.222
so the story you cooked up
is just that: a story.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.059
Wrong. It's what happened.
We have new evidence.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.227
Not nearly
enough evidence

28:15.327 --> 28:18.865
to overpower Mr. Bart's
constitutional protections.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.699
My client can never
be charged again.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.769
And as for Nate Taylor's murder,

28:22.869 --> 28:24.904
Mr. Bart's alibi
remains unchanged.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.306
He was asleep
when Nate was killed.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.575
She's right.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.645
You're free to go, Mr. Bart.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.190
I helped a man get away
with murder.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.225
You knew there was
something wrong

28:46.325 --> 28:48.427
with the prosecution's case,
and you said so.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.229
They hadn't figured out the MO.

28:50.329 --> 28:55.134
Look, Warren's acquittal's
on the D.A., not you.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.303
Not even this lab.

28:57.403 --> 28:58.670
We can't change the past, Chris.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.539
We have to focus on Nate now.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.608
I am.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.410
And I think Warren did it again.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.979
He could have used a new drone
to fake being framed.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.714
Think about it: what better way

29:08.815 --> 29:10.649
to get away with murder
for a second time?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.551
I can barely track that logic.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.053
I sincerely doubt
that Warren could.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.188
He just doesn't have enough
going on upstairs.

29:16.288 --> 29:19.458
Okay, I want to talk
about upstairs, actually.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.660
The balcony. So,

29:21.760 --> 29:24.430
the killer never
set foot up there, which means

29:24.530 --> 29:28.034
that the killer wrote on Nate's
eyelid before he went outside.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.468
Another guest at the party.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.103
That only narrows it
down a little.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.105
It was practically
an open house that night.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.107
Anyone could've
gone in and out.
True, but what is

29:35.207 --> 29:38.010
the one thing that everyone
at that party was doing?

29:38.110 --> 29:40.112
Filming.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.680
Constantly.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.583
Maybe one of them caught
the killer on camera.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.052
I'll scrub all
the housemate's accounts,

29:46.152 --> 29:47.719
try to find anyone
who was hanging around Nate.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.789
Maybe catch Warren in a lie.

29:52.892 --> 29:56.195
Okay, so,
I think it's time

29:56.295 --> 30:00.132
that you and me learn a little
more about invisible ink.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.135
Hey.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.604
Thought you'd want to know. Hmm.

30:05.704 --> 30:09.041
LVPD finished its investigation
into Chris's social media.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.510
And?
He didn't break any rules.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.745
At least
not since joining the lab.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.449
No sanctions recommended,
no suspension.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.786
Good. I'd love to go a full year
without a scandal in my lab.

30:20.887 --> 30:23.155
But there is something
you should see.

30:24.123 --> 30:27.026
Try searching ♪ChrisFails.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.160
Okay.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.265
Who's this guy?

30:33.365 --> 30:35.301
Keep scrolling.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.670
"@ChrisSolves, if we find you,

30:38.770 --> 30:40.672
you'll wish
you'd have ended it."

30:40.772 --> 30:43.209
Okay, that's basically
a death threat.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.911
And that's just
the public posts.

30:45.011 --> 30:48.147
I mean, his DMs are worse.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.749
I told him
that he should be carrying.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.751
What do you think
about putting a uni on him?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.453
At least till this blows over?

30:54.553 --> 30:56.022
Yeah, yeah.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.157
Yeah.

31:00.927 --> 31:03.329
You know, he does seem
a little... idealistic.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.398
Not always conscious of taking
precautions in the field.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.866
Uh-huh.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.369
Sorry. I'm just...

31:11.904 --> 31:13.906
How did
your doctor's appointment go?

31:14.006 --> 31:17.076
It was a routine
post-concussion checkup.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.678
You were admitted
to a hospital.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.781
For an overnight sleep test.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.954
I'm fine.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.756
Okay.

31:30.856 --> 31:33.092
Good.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.398
Lot of people been asking,

31:39.498 --> 31:42.401
"Vincent, how did Warren Bart
get away with murder again?"

31:42.501 --> 31:45.304
Well, let's start
from the beginning.

31:46.238 --> 31:50.076
Hello,
Unknown Blonde Guest Number 14.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.877
You've won
an all-expense-paid trip

31:51.978 --> 31:54.113
to my spreadsheet of suspects.

31:54.213 --> 31:57.149
I mean, there weren't
this many people at my wedding.

31:57.249 --> 31:58.684
It's gonna take days
for us to log everybody

31:58.784 --> 32:00.019
Nate's interacted with.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.520
We out of here-- free Warren!

32:01.620 --> 32:03.755
Peace, love,

32:03.855 --> 32:05.391
truth prevails, baby!

32:05.491 --> 32:07.526
Truth prevails! Let's go!

32:09.461 --> 32:12.331
Excuse me. If you're
gonna self-flagellate,

32:12.431 --> 32:14.200
could you find
someplace private?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.867
We got a lot of party
to go through,

32:15.968 --> 32:17.936
and I can't give it
the Zapruder treatment solo.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.107
Can you tell me why anybody
would want to do this?

32:21.207 --> 32:23.309
Be a... be an influencer?

32:23.409 --> 32:25.911
Yeah, I can.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.148
Having thousands
of people tell you

32:29.248 --> 32:32.684
that what you're doing is cool
feels... awesome.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.786
A little too awesome.
It's addicting, really.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.322
I've been there.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.556
I mean, kind of.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.191
Getting praise for
the wrong reasons.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.759
That's the reason
I left Dow.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.961
I started to care more
about the attaboys than the...

32:43.062 --> 32:44.663
the work itself, the...
All right, so,

32:44.763 --> 32:46.432
invisible ink was a bust.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.834
It just came from a generic,
store-bought pen.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.436
Nothing traceable.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.739
But I did solve
one minor mystery.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.774
Hmm. Oh.

32:55.874 --> 32:58.744
Did Sonya take that for
her collection? I know she was

32:58.844 --> 33:00.279
jazzed about
the burst blood vessels.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.514
No, I-I took that,
thank you very much.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.451
And look--
those aren't burst blood vessels

33:05.551 --> 33:07.053
that caused the trauma
after all.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.088
See that? That's mucus
under the invisible ink.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.622
Nate had conjunctivitis.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.424
The victim had pink eye?

33:12.524 --> 33:15.727
Probably not the worst infection
bouncing around that house.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.531
Boy, he's a tough crowd
today. Usually...

33:19.631 --> 33:21.133
Guys, guys.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.001
I think I found the drone.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.903
In the parking lot earlier,
Beau almost crashed

33:25.003 --> 33:26.372
after slicing
the dummy's neck, right?

33:26.472 --> 33:27.906
Excuse me. Landed it
just fine.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.575
Right, right,
but maybe the killer didn't.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.044
This video was posted
within minutes

33:32.144 --> 33:33.879
of Nate's
estimated time of death.

33:33.979 --> 33:35.947
So where did it land?

33:42.854 --> 33:46.058
Yeah, the drone had to have
landed right around here.

33:55.367 --> 33:56.468
Damn.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.205
Well, it's already been
two days.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.407
We're not that lucky.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.710
But you see that?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.578
What?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.217
Oh, man.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.951
Oh, this bush
is attacking me.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.053
Gotcha.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.523
What is that?

34:18.457 --> 34:20.759
I think it's a piece
of a wet wipe?

34:20.859 --> 34:24.096
Looks like a little-little
critter kind of got to it.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.431
Shredded it up
pretty good.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.065
Yeah, looks like
a rat tore it up for its nest.

34:31.002 --> 34:34.406
Oh. Oh.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.686
That is definitely blood.

34:49.221 --> 34:50.789
So the killer cleaned
Nate's blood

34:50.889 --> 34:53.225
off the drone
after the murder.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.494
A rodent saved a piece
of evidence for us.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.763
If the killer wasn't wearing
gloves, we could have DNA.

34:57.863 --> 35:01.133
Stuart Little might've just
solved your case, Chris.

35:33.432 --> 35:34.666
Still inconclusive?

35:34.766 --> 35:35.867
Looks like any touch DNA

35:35.967 --> 35:38.837
on your sample is beyond hope.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.139
But you still have
the partial alleles.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.176
Can't you reconstruct the DNA
with the PCR thing that you do?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.811
You know, how
they fill in the gaps

35:45.911 --> 35:47.145
like they do
in <i>Jurassic Park?</i>

35:47.246 --> 35:49.181
So, first of all,
that's not a thing.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.317
And secondly, no,
because your sample--

35:51.417 --> 35:53.018
it took a bath in Clorox.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.853
Oh, man. Mm.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.755
If I had thought about
how much bleach is baked

35:56.855 --> 35:58.590
into these wipes, I would've
spared myself the pain.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.359
You got to get
some antibacterial on that

36:00.459 --> 36:01.627
'cause it could
still get infected.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.895
Whoa, hold on. Scratches.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.031
No, it's fine. No.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.267
Scratches.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.269
For those viewers coming over
from @ChrisSolves' channel,

36:10.369 --> 36:14.172
welcome, my friends,
to the right side of history.

36:14.273 --> 36:16.275
Hold still.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.143
No. It hurts.

36:18.244 --> 36:21.179
Isn't swabbing, like,
CSI 101, Chris?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.782
Hey, can you be careful
with that stuff, please?

36:23.882 --> 36:26.184
That's my livelihood.
We got a warrant, bud.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.619
This is a big-time setup.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.689
Yo, how many followers
you got there, @SleuthVCF?

36:30.789 --> 36:33.225
You can call me Vincent.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.160
And, gosh,

36:35.261 --> 36:36.595
I don't know.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.929
How about those scratches?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.531
Where'd you get them?

36:39.631 --> 36:41.367
I went hiking
at Lost Creek last week.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.768
Lost Creek?

36:42.868 --> 36:45.637
That's a paved trail.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.339
I like to go off

36:47.439 --> 36:49.708
the beaten path, Chris.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.878
Got a little too ambitious.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.146
I know you follow me online.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.148
I follow you, too.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.717
You reviewed

36:58.817 --> 37:01.353
a heavy-duty quadcopter drone
six months ago.

37:01.453 --> 37:02.788
I sold it a week later.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.023
It was just too big,
hard to fly.

37:05.123 --> 37:06.191
It didn't, uh...

37:06.292 --> 37:09.395
elevate my content.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.532
It's not here.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.367
All right, well,

37:15.467 --> 37:16.968
if you guys are done, I have

37:17.068 --> 37:19.538
a live stream in ten minutes,
thank you very much.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.407
Take off your glasses.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.010
No. Why?

37:25.110 --> 37:27.078
You can do it,
or I can do it for you.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.180
Our warrant covers
your physical person.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.851
Okay.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.690
Thank you, Vincent.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.360
I'm gonna get
to practice my swabbing.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.362
<i>Right in your eye.</i>

38:07.519 --> 38:09.888
Got some bad news for you.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.990
The kind of pinkeye
you have?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.625
Antibiotics won't help.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.293
It's gonna linger
for a while.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.228
Okay.

38:17.329 --> 38:20.098
I guess nobody should
borrow my mascara.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.134
What are we talking about?

38:23.234 --> 38:24.903
We're talking
about the adenovirus

38:25.003 --> 38:27.272
that's causing
your conjunctivitis.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.508
And the fact that it's...

38:29.608 --> 38:31.910
100% identical

38:32.010 --> 38:34.880
to the strain
we found in Nate Taylor's eye.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.748
<i>You got it when you scribbled</i>

38:36.848 --> 38:38.950
<i>my internet handle
on Nate's face.</i>

38:42.020 --> 38:44.289
You steered Nate out
onto that balcony.

38:44.390 --> 38:47.459
And then you revved up that
drone that you claim you sold.

38:47.559 --> 38:49.528
And you slit
his throat.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.763
You can deny it, but, uh,

38:51.863 --> 38:53.799
going viral here?

38:53.899 --> 38:55.534
It's gonna put you behind bars.

38:55.634 --> 38:57.603
See, Vincent,
it's the little things.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.137
Like, microscopic.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.907
But you already know that,
you're a super sleuth.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.942
I was right.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.277
The whole time.

39:06.378 --> 39:07.913
About everything.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.516
I always said that
Warren and Nate were guilty.

39:10.616 --> 39:13.752
And you said I no idea
what I was talking about.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.687
That my grasp
of evidentiary

39:15.787 --> 39:17.389
procedure was weak.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.957
You remember that?

39:19.057 --> 39:21.092
Do you know what that did
to my credibility?

39:21.192 --> 39:23.395
Do you even realize
what that video cost me?

39:23.495 --> 39:26.231
I lost 20%
of my followers overnight.

39:26.331 --> 39:29.000
You only had 8,000 followers
at your height, Vincent.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.869
You really think that...

39:30.969 --> 39:33.104
a couple thousand people
clicking unsubscribe

39:33.204 --> 39:34.973
justifies murder?
Shut up, boomer.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.009
It's not just the followers.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.311
'Cause you rode that momentum

39:40.412 --> 39:41.880
all the way here.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.549
All the way to my dream job.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.684
If you wanted to be a CSI,
you could've just applied.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.954
I did. And I got rejected twice.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.825
So I used it as fuel.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.161
For what?
To get the truth out there.

39:56.261 --> 39:59.230
About Warren Bart...
and Nate Taylor.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.399
So I did what
you people couldn't.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.902
I figured out
how Ana Reynolds was killed.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.337
All right, let's go.
Now everybody knows, Chris.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.239
Everybody knows
that you're a fraud.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.175
Hands behind your back.

40:10.275 --> 40:11.977
You don't even deserve
to wear a lab coat.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.212
I found you, didn't I?

40:16.381 --> 40:18.684
You helped a murderer walk, Chris.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.286
I just punished one.
Let's go.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.423
<i>I have some good news.</i>

40:25.524 --> 40:27.258
LVPD has cleared you.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.427
You are off the hook
with them.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.497
But you are not
off the hook with me.

40:31.597 --> 40:33.198
These videos
that you post.

40:33.298 --> 40:35.133
Just putting yourself
out there, it's...

40:35.233 --> 40:38.303
After this,
I promise I get it.

40:38.403 --> 40:40.271
And again...

40:40.371 --> 40:42.741
I'll never post
about an ongoing case.

40:42.841 --> 40:43.975
These days...

40:44.075 --> 40:47.479
every time you leave
this office,

40:47.579 --> 40:50.015
you are at risk.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.518
We have to be smart.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.953
And we have
to protect ourselves.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.055
From now on...

40:57.155 --> 40:59.558
I'll stick to Instagram.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.593
Are you kidding me?
Instagram...

41:01.693 --> 41:04.162
I'm kidding.
Kidding, boss.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.166
Do not make yourself a target.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.546
<i>I need to set
the record straight.</i>

41:20.646 --> 41:22.781
I was wrong
about the Ana Reynolds case.

41:22.881 --> 41:24.683
My theory that Warren Bart

41:24.783 --> 41:27.586
didn't kill Ana
with an axe missed the point.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.320
This was the murder weapon.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.889
By now you've all heard
we found one

41:30.989 --> 41:32.423
just like it in Warren's house.

41:32.524 --> 41:35.927
I don't get to say
that Warren Bart is a murderer.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.196
But I can say

41:38.296 --> 41:40.065
that he shouldn't benefit
from the deaths

41:40.165 --> 41:42.400
of Ana Reynolds and Nate Taylor.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.837
So don't like.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.773
Don't subscribe.
Unfollow Warren.

41:47.873 --> 41:51.276
