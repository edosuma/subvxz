08:38.496 --> 08:40.264
Cat got your tongue?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.967
- Victoria.
- Victoria?

08:45.437 --> 08:47.238
You must have another.

08:48.306 --> 08:49.441
Another?

08:51.309 --> 08:54.310
The naming of cats

08:54.312 --> 08:57.045
is a difficult matter.

08:57.047 --> 09:01.016
It isn't just
one of your holiday games.

09:01.018 --> 09:05.087
You may think at first
I'm as mad as a hatter

09:05.089 --> 09:09.292
when I tell you a cat must
have three different names.

09:09.294 --> 09:10.527
First of all,

09:10.529 --> 09:12.462
there's the name
that the family use daily,

09:12.464 --> 09:13.530
such as...

09:13.532 --> 09:15.331
- Peter.
- Augustus.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.534
- Alonzo.
- Or James.

09:17.536 --> 09:21.504
But I tell you a cat needs
a name that's particular.

09:21.506 --> 09:25.341
A name that's peculiar
and more dignified.

09:25.343 --> 09:27.176
Else how can he keep up

09:27.178 --> 09:29.279
his tail perpendicular?

09:29.281 --> 09:31.213
Or spread out his whiskers?

09:31.215 --> 09:33.148
Or cherish his pride?

09:33.150 --> 09:35.083
But above and beyond,

09:35.085 --> 09:37.387
there's still
one name left over.

09:37.389 --> 09:40.222
And that is the name
that you never will guess.

09:40.224 --> 09:44.327
The name that no human research
can discover,

09:44.329 --> 09:48.263
but the cat herself knows
and will never confess.

09:48.265 --> 09:52.502
When you notice a cat
in profound meditation,

09:52.504 --> 09:55.805
the reason, I tell you,
is always the same.

09:55.807 --> 09:57.507
Her mind is engaged

09:57.509 --> 10:01.210
in a rapt contemplation
of the thought,

10:01.212 --> 10:04.514
of the thought, of the thought

10:04.516 --> 10:06.449
of her name.

10:06.451 --> 10:08.551
Her ineffable,

10:08.553 --> 10:10.453
