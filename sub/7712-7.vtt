WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:02.236
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME

00:02.270 --> 00:03.471
BUT IT DID,
TOTALLY DID.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.440
I LOVE CAMPING.
* ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

00:06.474 --> 00:07.641
WELL IT WASN'T CAMPING.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.377
IT WAS MORE
OF A WILDERNESS RETREAT.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.611
MORNING.
MICHAEL.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.380
RYAN INVITED SOME
OF THE BRANCH MANAGERS

00:12.413 --> 00:14.048
AND TOBY INTO THE WOODS

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
FOR A "GET TO KNOW YOU"
WEEKEND.

00:15.816 --> 00:19.320
MICHAEL WASN'T INVITED.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.821
APPARENTLY THEY ALREADY KNEW

00:20.854 --> 00:23.457
EVERYTHING THEY NEEDED TO KNOW
ABOUT HIM.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.825
DID YOU SLEEP IN CABINS?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.627
UNDER THE STARS.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.063
IT WAS REALLY BEAUTIFUL.
YOU SHOULD'VE COME.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.798
BOB AND I TOOK
ROCK CLIMBING LESSONS ONCE.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.666
[Michael chuckles]

00:34.868 --> 00:38.072
MICHAEL WASN'T INVITED
ON RYAN'S CAMPING TRIP.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.774
TOBY WENT,
BUT MICHAEL DIDN'T GO.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.843
HE WASN'T INVITED.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.145
WHO WENT?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.114
ME, DAN FROM BUFFALO,
MARK CHISHOLM,

00:46.147 --> 00:47.748
JEFF FROM ALBANY,

00:47.781 --> 00:49.183
AND RYAN OBVIOUSLY.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.319
WE HAD SO MANY SMORES
I FINALLY HAD TO SAY,

00:51.352 --> 00:54.155
"NO MORE SMORES,
NO MORE SMORES."

00:54.188 --> 00:56.724
[laughing]

00:58.759 --> 01:01.129
(Toby)
RYAN INVITED ME TO GO

01:01.162 --> 01:02.863
ON HIS WILDERNESS ADVENTURE
RETREAT.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.533
IT WAS THIS AMAZING,
BEAUTIFUL--

01:05.566 --> 01:07.868
[loud banging]
HEY, NOBODY CARES.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.869
NOBODY CARES.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.272
I NEED THAT ROOM
AT SOME POINT

01:11.305 --> 01:13.841
SO JUST WRAP IT UP.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.410
MICHAEL WASN'T INVITED.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.413
[cheerful music]

01:19.447 --> 01:27.455
*

01:36.930 --> 01:38.366
HYPOTHETICALLY,

01:38.399 --> 01:41.469
IF I WERE TO ASK YOU
TO GO CAMPING...

01:41.502 --> 01:42.570
MM-HMM.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.138
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
"HYPOTHETICAL" MEANS?

01:44.172 --> 01:46.174
NOT REAL.
GOT IT.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.675
SO IF I WERE TO HYPOTHETICALLY
ASK YOU

01:47.708 --> 01:50.344
TO GO CAMPING WITH ME,
WOULD YOU GO?

01:50.378 --> 01:51.779
ABSOLUTELY, YES.

01:51.812 --> 01:52.913
WHEN MICHAEL PLAYS
THE HYPOTHETICAL GAME,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.216
I ALWAYS SAY YES.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.717
REALLY?
YEAH.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.286
OH, DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY?

01:58.319 --> 02:00.221
AND I AM ALWAYS BUSY.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.555
OH, CAN'T GO TODAY

02:01.589 --> 02:03.257
'CAUSE I'M DONATING BLOOD.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.559
HOW OFTEN CAN YOU ACTUALLY
DONATE BLOOD?

02:05.593 --> 02:08.596
IS THERE A LIMIT?
I DON'T--

02:08.629 --> 02:10.431
YOUR BODY ONLY HAS
A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.733
WELL IS THAT IT, OR...

02:12.766 --> 02:15.269
YEAH, JUST THIS WHOLE TOBY
CAMPING THING.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.805
I DON'T KNOW.
IT SEEMS A LITTLE LAME.

02:17.838 --> 02:18.906
HOW SO?

02:18.939 --> 02:22.543
A BUNCH OF GUYS
IN A TENT MAKING SMORES?

02:22.576 --> 02:23.777
HMM.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.912
WHAT'S THAT?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.214
HELLO, I'M BROKEN MOUNTAIN.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.248
YOU KNOW?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.249
HERE'S THE THING.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.483
THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU GO CAMPING.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.352
I THINK YOU GO CAMPING
BY YOURSELF...

02:31.385 --> 02:32.353
RIGHT.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.821
IN THE WILDERNESS.
MM-HMM.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.888
IT'S NOT WITH A GROUP
OF GUYS

02:34.922 --> 02:36.557
FROLICKING AROUND
IN TENTS.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.359
IT'S ONE GUY,

02:38.392 --> 02:40.294
OR TWO GUYS
IF YOUR PLANS CHANGE.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.061
NOT GONNA CHANGE.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.430
I WANT TO DO IT MYSELF,
YOU KNOW?

02:42.463 --> 02:44.398
I WANT TO GO AND--

02:44.432 --> 02:46.500
AND FIND OUT SOMETHING
ABOUT MYSELF.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.935
I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
MM-HMM.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.905
ALL THE CLIQUES
AND THE OFFICE POLITICS.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.542
FLUORESCENT LIGHTS
AND THE ASBESTOS.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.943
I THOUGHT WE HAD THAT LOOKED AT.

02:55.976 --> 02:57.211
I'M SICK OF IT JIM.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.779
I'M SICK OF THIS PLACE.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.848
WHEN JAN AND I HAD SATELLITE,

03:00.881 --> 03:03.851
WE USED TO WATCH A REALITY SHOW
CALLED SURVIVORMAN.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.954
AND IT WAS INTERESTING

03:06.987 --> 03:08.456
BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT A GUY

03:08.489 --> 03:11.459
WHO WOULD GO OUT
INTO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

03:11.492 --> 03:13.394
AND JUST TRY NOT TO DIE,

03:13.427 --> 03:16.964
TRY NOT TO GET EATEN
BY AN ANIMAL OR...

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
BE OVEREXPOSED.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.701
OKAY, I WILL ONLY NEED
TWO THINGS:

03:20.734 --> 03:22.803
A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE
AND A KNIFE.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.738
I'M ON IT.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.607
OKAY, THIRTY MINUTES OR LESS,
PLEASE COME BACK.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.510
SAVE THE RECEIPT.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.678
HEY, WHAT--

03:30.711 --> 03:31.679
LET'S SEE IF ANY OF THESE
WILL WORK.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.746
HEY HEY HEY!

03:32.780 --> 03:33.914
DWIGHT--

03:33.947 --> 03:34.915
DWIGHT.

03:34.948 --> 03:35.816
I KEEP VARIOUS WEAPONRY

03:35.849 --> 03:37.885
STRATEGICALLY PLACED
AROUND THE OFFICE.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.588
I SAVED JIM'S LIFE
WITH A CAN OF PEPPER SPRAY

03:40.621 --> 03:43.491
I HAD VELCROED UNDER MY DESK.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.394
PEOPLE SAY,
"OH, IT'S DANGEROUS

03:46.427 --> 03:49.029
TO KEEP WEAPONS IN THE HOME
OR THE WORKPLACE."

03:49.062 --> 03:51.499
WELL I SAY IT'S BETTER
TO BE HURT

03:51.532 --> 03:53.701
BY SOMEONE YOU KNOW
ACCIDENTALLY

03:53.734 --> 03:56.637
THAN BY A STRANGER
ON PURPOSE.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.940
DWIGHT AND I ARE GOING OUT.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.676
HE WILL RETURN LATER,
BUT I WILL NOT.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.414
I WILL ALSO BE TAKING
A PERSONAL DAY TOMORROW

04:06.447 --> 04:08.482
AND PERHAPS THE NEXT DAY.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.584
DO YOU WANT ME TO ASK
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

04:10.618 --> 04:12.453
NO.
GREAT.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.454
DWIGHT WILL BE DRIVING ME

04:13.487 --> 04:16.324
DEEP INTO THE PENNSYLVANIA
WILDERNESS...
OH.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.625
WHERE HE WILL THEN LEAVE ME

04:17.658 --> 04:21.295
TO EITHER DIE
OR TO SURVIVE.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.463
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.464
(Jim)
MMM, NO.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.998
THE CHOICE IS ACTUALLY YOURS.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.334
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.502
YES, AND I AM LEAVING YOU

04:28.536 --> 04:31.339
IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY

04:31.372 --> 04:33.040
AND FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.308
DO NOT TRY TO FOLLOW ME.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.208
OKAY, GREAT.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.811
THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL,
PRIVATE EXPERIENCE

04:37.845 --> 04:40.414
IN THE WILD THAT I WISH
TO SHARE

04:40.448 --> 04:42.850
WITH ME, MYSELF, AND I.
YEP.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.418
WHEN I RETURN,

04:44.452 --> 04:46.520
I HOPE TO BE A COMPLETELY
CHANGED HUMAN BEING.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.788
THAT'D BE GREAT.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.591
DO I BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL
POSSESSES THE SKILLS

04:50.624 --> 04:53.627
TO SURVIVE
IN A HOSTEL ENVIRONMENT?

04:53.661 --> 04:56.597
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.632
NO, I DO NOT.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.670
THIS IS WHAT
A TRUE SURVIVORMAN DOES.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.472
YOU SIMULATE A DISASTER,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.106
LIKE A PLANE WRECK.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.609
YOU CAN ONLY WEAR THE CLOTHES
THAT YOU HAVE ON.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.843
AND YOU CAN ONLY USE
THE STUFF

05:09.877 --> 05:11.479
THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR POCKETS.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.646
NOW IN THIS CASE,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.783
THIS DISASTER
IS A SERIAL KILLER,

05:15.816 --> 05:17.718
CREEPY GUY WHO'S ABDUCTED ME,

05:17.751 --> 05:20.621
AND IS TAKING ME OUT
INTO THE WILDERNESS

05:20.654 --> 05:21.722
TO LEAVE ME FOR DEAD.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.123
NO, I WOULD NEVER
LEAVE YOU FOR DEAD.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.425
YOU WOULD NEVER ESCAPE.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.426
WELL YES, I WOULD

05:25.459 --> 05:26.259
AND I WOULD SURVIVE.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.428
I WOULD MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WERE DEAD.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.496
BELIEVE ME.
NO.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.497
THEN I WOULD REMOVE
YOUR TEETH

05:29.530 --> 05:30.531
AND CUT OFF YOUR FINGERTIPS

05:30.564 --> 05:31.432
SO YOU COULD NOT
BE IDENTIFIED.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.666
AND THEY WOULD CALL ME
THE OVERKILL KILLER.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.934
YOU--YOU ARE--

05:33.967 --> 05:36.770
YOU ARE AS CREEPY
AS A REAL SERIAL KILLER.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.705
FOR REAL.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.772
OKAY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.541
I AM PUTTING THIS ON

05:40.574 --> 05:43.010
SO I HAVE NO FAMILIARITY
WITH MY SURROUNDINGS.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.079
NOW THIS WAY
I CAN'T RETRACE MY STEPS.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.615
I DON'T KNOW WHAT STREETS
WE'VE BEEN--

05:47.648 --> 05:49.383
OW!

05:49.417 --> 05:50.283
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:50.317 --> 05:51.885
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS.

05:51.919 --> 05:52.886
NO--GOD!
HERE.

05:52.920 --> 05:53.987
DWIGHT, STOP IT!
STOP IT!

05:54.021 --> 05:55.389
STOP IT!

05:55.423 --> 05:56.557
DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS RIGHT
OR NOT?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.526
PLEASE ALLOW ME TO HAVE

05:58.559 --> 06:02.396
ONE CATHARTIC EXPERIENCE
IN MY LIFE?

06:02.430 --> 06:04.732
JIM, WE NEED TO ORDER
A CAKE

06:04.765 --> 06:05.633
FOR CREED'S BIRTHDAY.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.968
OH, WASN'T IT JUST
SOMEONE'S BIRTHDAY?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.571
YES, KELLY'S WAS LAST WEEK,
REMEMBER?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.705
I DO REMEMBER, YEAH.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.040
IT'S BIRTHDAY MONTH.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.508
CREED'S IS TODAY,

06:14.542 --> 06:16.143
OSCAR'S IS WEEK AFTER NEXT,

06:16.176 --> 06:17.811
MEREDITH'S IS AT THE END
OF THE MONTH.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.846
[sighs]

06:18.879 --> 06:20.080
MICHAEL USUALLY GOES
WITH RED AND WHITE STREAMERS--

06:20.113 --> 06:21.749
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE AN IDEA.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.084
WHY DON'T WE JUST DO
ONE BIG SHARED PARTY?

06:24.117 --> 06:25.686
WHAT?

06:25.719 --> 06:28.155
THERE ARE 13 PEOPLE
WORKING IN THIS OFFICE.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.758
SO 13 TIMES A YEAR,

06:30.791 --> 06:33.761
MICHAEL GETS A CAKE
AND BALLOONS

06:33.794 --> 06:35.629
AND SOME SORT OF JOKE GIFT

06:35.663 --> 06:36.864
AND MAKES A TOAST.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.865
AND THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF TOASTS.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.667
ONE IS A JOKE

06:39.700 --> 06:40.934
ABOUT HOW OLD YOU ARE.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.503
OOH, LOOK AT THOSE WRINKLES.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.804
BLACKS DO CRACK!

06:43.837 --> 06:45.473
NOT CRACK THE DRUG.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.775
(Jim)
AND THE OTHER
IS SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE...

06:47.808 --> 06:49.009
OR HORRIBLE.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.078
OR BOTH.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.245
WHAT ELSE?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.548
HE ONLY SINGS THE HIGH HARMONY
TO HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.751
[falsetto singing]

06:57.785 --> 07:00.521
AND HE IS A VERY BIG BELIEVER
IN SURPRISE PARTIES.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.856
MAYBE EVEN ARGUABLY,
POSSIBLY TO A FAULT.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.124
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
[screams]

07:04.157 --> 07:05.192
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
OH!

07:05.225 --> 07:07.695
[laughing]

07:07.728 --> 07:09.463
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
OH!

07:09.497 --> 07:10.564
[laughing]

07:10.598 --> 07:12.500
(Jim)
SO I THINK, YEAH--

07:12.533 --> 07:13.601
I THINK GETTING THESE
OUT OF THE WAY

07:13.634 --> 07:14.602
MIGHT BE PRODUCTIVE.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.869
AAH!

07:15.903 --> 07:18.839
WE CAN JUST HAVE
ONE BIG FUN PARTY.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.873
AND EVERYBODY'S HAPPY

07:19.907 --> 07:21.041
AND NOBODY WASTES THEIR TIME.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.476
I DON'T LIKE IT.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.884
WOW, YOU'RE SHAKING THINGS UP
A BIT, HUH?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.219
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA,
DON'T YOU THINK?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.854
DO YOU THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA?

07:33.887 --> 07:34.988
NO...

07:35.022 --> 07:37.190
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.792
HMM.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.998
WE'RE HERE.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.736
DWIGHT WILL
TAKE MY BLINDFOLD OFF

07:48.769 --> 07:50.538
WHEN WE ARE DEEP
IN THE FOREST.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.873
JUST THE TWO OF US
FROM THIS POINT OUT.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.743
HERE WE GO.
JUST THE TWO OF US.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.047
HERE WE GO
INTO THE WILD

08:00.080 --> 08:02.583
TO THE MIGHTY FOREST.

08:02.616 --> 08:06.754
CAN YOU SMELL THE TREES
AND THE NATURE?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.856
KEEP GOING.
YOU'RE FINE.

08:08.889 --> 08:13.627
JUST SOME BUSHES
AND SOME THICKETS.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.995
KEEP GOING.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.964
[Michael breathing heavily]

08:16.997 --> 08:19.299
YOU WANTED WILDERNESS,
YOU GOT IT.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.134
YOU KNOW, TRY SENDING THEM
ANOTHER INVOICE.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.003
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:23.036 --> 08:27.708
OH, DID YOU SEE MY MEMO,
BY THE WAY?

08:27.741 --> 08:28.976
"LET'S BE HONEST.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.043
AS FUN AS BIRTHDAY'S ARE

08:30.077 --> 08:31.979
"WE ALL COULD USE A BREAK
FROM THE CONSTANT CAKE.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.715
"SO LET'S CELEBRATE
BIRTHDAY MONTH IN STYLE TODAY."

08:34.748 --> 08:37.851
THIS IS REALLY...

08:37.885 --> 08:38.819
COOL.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.320
RIGHT?
YEAH.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.622
I-I WAS JUST THINKING--

08:41.655 --> 08:43.290
NO, TOTALLY.
TOTALLY.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.192
THIS WAY WE GET IT
ALL OUT OF THE WAY AT ONCE

08:45.225 --> 08:46.827
AND IT COULD ACTUALLY BE FUN.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.829
RIGHT!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.964
EXACTLY.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.966
I KNEW I COULD COUNT
ON YOU.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.104
(Dwight)
THIS IS AS GOOD A SPOT
AS ANY.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.677
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:03.711 --> 09:04.912
STOP IT.
DWIGHT, JUST STOP IT!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.013
I'M JUST--
STOP IT!

09:06.046 --> 09:09.549
SPIN--I'M TRYING TO CONFUSE
YOUR SENSE OF DIRECTION!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.725
(Dwight)
BEHOLD.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.926
(Michael)
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
THANK YOU, DWIGHT.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.860
(Dwight)
HERE'S YOUR KNIFE.

09:19.893 --> 09:20.861
(Michael)
THANK YOU.

09:20.894 --> 09:21.862
(Dwight)
AND HERE'S YOUR DUCT TAPE.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.863
(Michael)
GOOD.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.098
ALL RIGHT.
VERY GOOD.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.034
UH, OKAY.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.869
[voice breaking]
YEP, GOOD LUCK,
MICHAEL.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.205
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.175
OKAY, OKAY...

09:35.208 --> 09:39.212
LEAVE ME BE, DWIGHT.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.115
HEY JIM,
CAN I HAVE MY OWN CAKE?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.250
WHAT'S THAT?

09:43.283 --> 09:44.618
I REALLY PREFER
DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.653
OH, SURE.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.387
YES, AWESOME!
OKAY.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
WOW, THAT WAS EASY.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.024
YEAH, PEOPLE LIKE ME
I GUESS.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.293
[knocking on window]
JIM.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.662
I HATE DEVIL'S FOOD.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.663
WELL I THINK MEREDITH--

09:55.696 --> 09:56.997
SCREW MEREDITH.

09:57.030 --> 09:57.898
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR
TO LET SOMEONE ELSE

09:57.931 --> 09:59.032
PICK THE CAKE THE CAKE
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.033
EVERYBODY'S BIRTHDAY.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.769
TODAY IS ACTUALLY MY BIRTHDAY

10:01.802 --> 10:03.303
AND I WANT TO PICK THE CAKE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.005
I WANT PIE.
I WANT PEACH PIE.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.306
YOU WANT BIRTHDAY PIE?
I WANT A NICE COBBLER.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.307
WELL I'M GONNA TALK
TO ANGELA

10:07.340 --> 10:08.776
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT A PIE.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.810
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU TALK TO

10:09.843 --> 10:11.311
JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN.
IT'LL BE ANGELA.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.880
YOU TELL HER IT'S FOR CREED.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.014
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.986
OKAY.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.854
[clears throat]

10:20.888 --> 10:22.155
DAY ONE.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.891
I'M IN THE INTERIOR

10:23.924 --> 10:26.026
OF THE VAST PENNSYLVANIA
WILDERNESS.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.962
I'VE BROUGHT WITH ME
ONLY THE BARE ESSENTIALS.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.666
A KNIFE, ROLL OF DUCT TAPE

10:32.700 --> 10:34.968
IN CASE I NEED
TO FASHION A SHELTER

10:35.002 --> 10:37.905
OR MAKE SOME SORT
OF WATER VESSEL.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.273
IT'S HOT TODAY.

10:40.307 --> 10:44.077
THE SUN IS IN THE TWO-THIRDS
EASTERLY QUADRANT

10:44.111 --> 10:46.847
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT ABOUT...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.149
2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.218
REALLY BEATING DOWN ON ME NOW.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.988
AND I THINK THAT I WANT
TO GET

10:55.022 --> 10:56.857
A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE

10:56.890 --> 11:01.394
BECAUSE THE SUN IS DEPLETING
MY RESOURCES.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.963
OKAY.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.898
[cloth rips]
OH, THERE WE GO.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.967
WATCH THAT I DON'T HIT

11:07.000 --> 11:09.202
MY CAROTID ARTERY HERE.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.038
I LIED TO MICHAEL.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.439
I SAID THAT I WOULD
LEAVE HIM ALONE,

11:12.472 --> 11:13.941
BUT I WILL NOT.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.342
I WILL REMAIN CLOSE BY

11:15.375 --> 11:17.745
TO PROVIDE UNSEEN
MORAL SUPPORT.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.913
BUT I WILL NEVER HELP HIM.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.082
I WILL LET HARM BEFALL HIM.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.417
I WILL EVEN LET HIM DIE.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.420
BUT I WILL NEVER LET HIM
LOSE HIS DIGNITY.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.057
THERE WE GO.
MUCH BETTER.

11:30.090 --> 11:35.062
NOW EVERYTHING I BROUGHT
WITH ME CAN BE USED.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.865
MY SPORT COAT HERE

11:37.898 --> 11:42.369
CAN BE FASHIONED
INTO A BACKPACK OF SORTS.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.940
I'M GOING TO WEAR
WHAT WAS ONCE...

11:46.974 --> 11:51.078
ONE OF MY PANT LEGS.

11:51.111 --> 11:54.081
SEE THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE
OF MATERIAL.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.283
THIS COULD BE USED
FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS.

11:56.316 --> 12:00.888
SOME SORT OF KERCHIEF...

12:00.921 --> 12:03.256
TO KEEP MY NECK
NICE AND COMFORTABLE.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.960
TUNA.

12:06.994 --> 12:07.995
ANDY.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.263
ME LIKEY THE ICE CREAM CAKE,
OKAY?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.299
"FUDGEY THE WHALE."

12:12.332 --> 12:13.433
NOT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.502
WELL I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU KNOW,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.037
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE
HAPPY,

12:17.070 --> 12:19.807
NAMELY ME, YOU WILL HAVE
A FUDGEY THE WHALE.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.508
ALL RIGHT.
GONNA LOOK INTO IT.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.410
BUT THE ANSWER'S NO.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.846
WOW, OKAY.
HARSH.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.347
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME
TO SHOW UP.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.317
HEY ANDY,
I HAVE SOME CALLS TO MAKE.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.219
LOUD AND CLEAR.
ALL RIGHT.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.023
PIZZA ROLLS.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.225
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
INTO THIS OFFICE HERE

12:38.258 --> 12:40.093
TO DO SOME WORK
SO I WILL BE IN HERE.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.361
MUSHROOM CAPS.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.231
I AM TOTALLY ALONE RIGHT NOW

12:44.264 --> 12:46.166
WITH ONLY MY THOUGHTS.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.434
I LOVE IT.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.869
* I'M LOVIN' IT

12:48.902 --> 12:52.505
I CAN LITERALLY SAY
ANYTHING I WANT.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.242
NO ONE IS GOING TO HEAR ME.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.244
[shouting]
WISH I COULD'VE GONE
WITH RYAN

12:57.277 --> 12:59.847
ON THAT COOL RETREAT!

12:59.880 --> 13:02.115
JAN HAS PLASTIC BOOBS!

13:02.149 --> 13:07.154
I-HAVE-HEMORRHOIDS!

13:07.187 --> 13:09.322
[chuckles]

13:09.356 --> 13:11.291
DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

13:11.324 --> 13:16.029
MICHAEL IS A MAN
OF GREAT DEPTH AND PASSION.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.066
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S SEARCHING
FOR OUT HERE.

13:19.099 --> 13:22.202
AH.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.603
HMM.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.205
BUT I HOPE HE FINDS IT.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.510
[whispering]
LUNCH.

13:30.543 --> 13:34.481
WELL IT IS A LITTLE CHILLIER
THAN I HAD THOUGHT

13:34.514 --> 13:37.317
SO I HAVE FASHIONED MY HAT
BACK INTO MY PANTS.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.319
SEVERAL HOURS IN.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.554
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FIND
SOME NOURISHMENT.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.257
NOW THESE WOODS ARE FULL
OF CREATURES

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
THAT CAN SUSTAIN HUMAN LIFE.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.129
THINGS LIKE, UH, SQUIRRELS.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.264
A NICE, JUICY RABBIT

13:51.298 --> 13:54.267
WOULD BE DELICIOUS.

13:54.301 --> 13:58.271
ABOUT TWO MORE MINUTES.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.441
I HAVE MADE THIS SPEAR

14:01.474 --> 14:06.246
WITH WHICH I WILL IMPALE
MY DINNER.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.981
AND IT COULDN'T COME
A MOMENT TOO SOON

14:08.015 --> 14:10.250
BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN
WITHOUT FOOD

14:10.283 --> 14:14.054
FOR A GOOD THREE HOURS
OR SO.

14:14.087 --> 14:19.092
STARTING TO FEEL IT
A LITTLE BIT.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.062
[sighs heavily]

14:22.095 --> 14:24.164
IT'S CREED'S BIRTHDAY TODAY.

14:24.197 --> 14:29.302
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

14:29.336 --> 14:33.573
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

14:33.606 --> 14:36.143
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY

14:36.176 --> 14:39.646
[falsetto singing]
* DEAR CRE-ED

14:39.679 --> 14:44.884
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU *

14:47.287 --> 14:49.289
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BUDDY.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.259
WHAT IS JIM THINKING?
IT'S A BIRTHDAY.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.661
SO WHAT IF THERE'S
A LOT OF THEM.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.464
YEAH, I WORK HARD ALL DAY.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.400
I LIKE KNOWING THAT
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BREAK.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.669
MOST DAYS I JUST SIT
AND WAIT FOR THE BREAK.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.005
I TOOK AN EXTRA SHOT
OF INSULIN

15:05.038 --> 15:07.074
IN PREPARATION
FOR THIS CAKE TODAY.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.542
IF I DON'T HAVE SOME CAKE SOON,
I MIGHT DIE.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.111
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAVE
AN APPLE?

15:11.144 --> 15:13.046
WHY DON'T YOU MIND
YOUR BUSINESS?

15:13.080 --> 15:13.913
LISTEN, I FIGURED THIS OUT.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.249
JIMMY HAD HIS BIRTHDAY
THREE WEEKS AGO

15:16.283 --> 15:17.517
SO HE DOESN'T CARE.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.452
(Oscar)
I THINK THE POWER
WENT TO HIS HEAD.

15:19.486 --> 15:20.620
HEY, JIM!

15:20.653 --> 15:22.055
HEY GUYS,
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.691
NOTHING.
NOTHING GOING ON.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.194
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOTHING.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.361
COME ON, GANG.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.168
WELL IF YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS--

15:35.202 --> 15:37.670
I TENTED MY PANTS.

15:37.704 --> 15:41.975
I'VE MADE MYSELF A NICE
PANTS TENT SHELTER.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.343
AND THIS LITTLE GUY

15:43.376 --> 15:47.047
MAY BE DUNDER MIFFLIN PAPER
SOMEDAY.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.385
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.021
JUST USING THE SCOPE.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.123
SAFETY IS...

15:56.156 --> 15:59.626
[gun clicks]
ON.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.294
[knock on door,
door opens]

16:01.328 --> 16:03.496
HEY, JIM.
TOBY.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.466
HEY, I JUST GOT THE WORD
ON THE COMMUNAL BIRTHDAYS.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.500
[sighs]

16:07.534 --> 16:09.702
GREAT IDEA.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.204
OH, THANKS, MAN.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.039
YEAH.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.444
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN--

16:17.477 --> 16:19.179
MY BIRTHDAY WAS TWO MONTHS AGO.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.347
OH, OKAY.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.514
THERE WAS NO PARTY.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.515
WHAT?

16:22.549 --> 16:24.184
WELL...THERE WAS.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.021
BUT MICHAEL SCHEDULED IT
FOR 4:58 ON A FRIDAY.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.157
PEOPLE SANG IN THE PARKING LOT.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.324
MMM, I REMEMBER THAT.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.359
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT,

16:32.392 --> 16:33.360
MAYBE YOU COULD...

16:33.393 --> 16:35.295
INCLUDE ME.
SERIOUSLY?

16:35.328 --> 16:36.596
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU COULD ADD ME IN.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.431
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HARM IN THAT IS.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.300
TOBY'S GREAT.
HE'S GREAT.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.735
BUT SOMETIMES HE CAN BE
A LITTLE BIT MUCH.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.304
[imitates Toby]
"I DON'T SEE THE HARM IN THAT."

16:44.337 --> 16:45.705
WELL IT'S A CAKE, TOBY.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.041
SO, COME ON.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.109
OKAY, YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.277
WE'RE JUST GONNA
THROW YOU IN

16:50.310 --> 16:51.411
BECAUSE THE MORE THE MERRIER,
RIGHT?

16:51.444 --> 16:53.746
NO, NO WAY.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.116
I AM NOT A MACHINE, JIM.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.251
YOU CAN'T JUST CHANGE PLANS
WILLIE-NILLIE

16:58.285 --> 17:00.153
AND EXPECT THIS LITTLE MAGIC
PARTY ELVES TO DO YOUR BIDDING.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.588
WE ALREADY HAVE DEVIL'S FOOD,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.290
PEACH COBBLER,
"FUDGEY THE WHALE,"

17:03.323 --> 17:04.491
MUSHROOM CAPS--

17:04.524 --> 17:06.293
I'M ALLERGIC TO MUSHROOMS.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.260
THAT'S A BUMMER.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.163
OKAY, THEN WE NEED TO...

17:10.197 --> 17:11.198
HEY, EVERYBODY.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.632
HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.201
COULD I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,
PLEASE?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.568
'CAUSE WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS BIRTHDAY THING.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.636
CONFERENCE ROOM?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.505
YES, CONFERENCE ROOM.
FIVE MINUTES.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.407
N-N-NO.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.674
NO.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.176
WE'RE GONNA SOLVE IT
RIGHT HERE.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.144
WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY TALK
ABOUT IT OUT HERE.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.446
SO WHO HAS PROBLEMS
WITH THE BIRTHDAY THING?

17:26.479 --> 17:29.349
ONE, TWO, THREE--EVERYBODY.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.818
OKAY, SO THEN WE JUST
SHOULDN'T DO IT.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.154
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH TWO CAKES AND A PIE?

17:34.187 --> 17:35.455
OOH, I'LL TAKE 'EM!

17:35.488 --> 17:37.524
WELL NOBODY'S TOUCHING
MY COBBLER.

17:37.557 --> 17:41.294
HEY MICHAEL--
I MEAN JIM.

17:41.328 --> 17:44.497
YEP, PHYLLIS CALLED ME MICHAEL.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.233
AND I WILL ALWAYS AND FOREVER

17:46.266 --> 17:48.268
BE HAUNTED BY THAT FACT.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.137
UNDER THIS TREE,

17:50.170 --> 17:52.605
I THINK I STRUCK THE MOTHERLOAD.

17:52.639 --> 17:57.610
THOSE ARE NATURE'S
BEST MUSHROOMS.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.313
WILD, AND I HAVE TO SAY,

18:00.347 --> 18:02.315
THESE LITTLE BUGGERS
ARE DAMN TASTY AS WELL.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.384
(Dwight)
NO! NO!

18:04.417 --> 18:05.385
NO, MICHAEL!

18:05.418 --> 18:06.786
NO!

18:06.819 --> 18:08.321
NO!

18:08.355 --> 18:09.689
NO!

18:09.722 --> 18:11.324
(Michael)
UGH!

18:11.358 --> 18:12.359
(Dwight)
NO!

18:12.392 --> 18:13.693
GIVE 'EM UP!

18:13.726 --> 18:15.362
[grunting]

18:15.395 --> 18:17.330
[spitting]

18:17.364 --> 18:21.868
(all)
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

18:21.901 --> 18:25.705
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

18:25.738 --> 18:31.544
[Michael singing in falsetto]
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR CREED

18:31.578 --> 18:37.150
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

18:37.184 --> 18:39.486
YEAH!
WHOO!

18:39.519 --> 18:41.421
(Michael)
* SKIP AROUND THE ROOM

18:41.454 --> 18:43.156
* SKIP AROUND THE ROOM

18:43.190 --> 18:44.257
* WE WON'T--

18:44.291 --> 18:45.758
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.294
YIKE, DON'T TO THAT.
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK SOMETHING.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.929
MAN BECAME CIVILIZED
FOR A REASON.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.565
HE DECIDED THAT HE LIKE
TO HAVE WARMTH

18:52.599 --> 18:55.402
AND CLOTHING AND TELEVISION

18:55.435 --> 18:58.405
AND HAMBURGERS
AND TO WALK UPRIGHT.

18:58.438 --> 19:01.808
AND TO HAVE A SOFT FUTON
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

19:01.841 --> 19:05.478
HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE.

19:05.512 --> 19:06.613
I DON'T NEED THE WOODS.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.383
I HAVE A NICE WOOD DESK.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.452
I DON'T NEED FRESH AIR

19:12.485 --> 19:16.889
BECAUSE I HAVE THE FRESHEST AIR
AROUND: A.C.

19:16.923 --> 19:21.328
AND I DON'T NEED
WIDE OPEN SPACES.

19:21.361 --> 19:25.732
CHECK IT OUT.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.468
I CAN ALSO MAKE IT THE SKY.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.772
HI, BUDDY.
HEY.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.208
WORD UP.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.643
SURE GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.878
YOU ARE RELIEVED.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.580
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.949
SO WHAT DID I MISS?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.551
WELL I TRIED TO PUT
ALL THE BIRTHDAYS

19:44.584 --> 19:45.718
TOGETHER AT ONCE.

19:45.752 --> 19:46.786
UGH.

19:46.819 --> 19:47.854
SO...TERRIBLE IDEA.
YEAH.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.956
OKAY, I DID THAT.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.358
ROOKIE MISTAKE.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.926
YOU DID DO IT?
UH-HUH, YEAH.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.262
JUST WAIT.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.397
TEN YEARS,
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.501
WELL I DON'T THINK I'LL BE HERE
IN TEN YEARS, BUT...

20:01.534 --> 20:03.636
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.909
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!

20:09.942 --> 20:12.545
[chewing loudly]

20:12.579 --> 20:13.613
THAT'S WHAT WHO SAYS?

20:13.646 --> 20:14.847
I NEVER KNOW.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.716
[chuckling]

20:16.749 --> 20:18.651
I JUST SAY IT.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.354
I SAY STUFF LIKE THAT,
YOU KNOW,

20:21.388 --> 20:23.523
TO LIGHTEN THE TENSION

20:23.556 --> 20:24.791
WHEN THINGS SORT OF GET HARD.

20:24.824 --> 20:25.825
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

20:25.858 --> 20:26.826
[snorting]

20:26.859 --> 20:27.827
HEY!

20:27.860 --> 20:30.330
NICE!

20:30.363 --> 20:31.731
REALLY GOOD.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.904
BRAVO, MY YOUNG WARD.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.909
