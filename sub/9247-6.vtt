WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:05.744
- What are you doing?
- Making room in the closet.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.572
I'm taking some of our
clothes down to the basement.

00:07.659 --> 00:10.880
I don't see our clothes,
I see myclothes.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.360
Don't worry,
I left the three shirts

00:12.447 --> 00:13.665
you actually wear in there

00:13.752 --> 00:15.667
including your Blackhawks Jersey

00:15.754 --> 00:18.496
or, as I like to
call it, your weekend muumuu.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.759
How come my things always
get relegated to the basement?

00:20.846 --> 00:22.805
You put my guitar down
there and my rollerblades.

00:22.892 --> 00:25.373
I waited six months for you
to either skate past me

00:25.460 --> 00:28.811
or play me a song,
neither of which ever happened.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.683
Oh, I see, but your old tap
shoes made the final cut?

00:31.770 --> 00:35.426
So you planning on shuffling
off to Buffalo anytime soon?

00:35.513 --> 00:38.995
Hey, my tippy-taps
are a precious childhood memory.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.692
I know,
I've seen the video of you

00:40.779 --> 00:43.086
tippy-tapping
to Electric Avenue.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.348
Show-stopper, and I still have

00:44.435 --> 00:47.569
the burn marks from
the sparklers. Yeah.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.745
Come on, I might want
to wear those someday.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.399
There are five people
in this house

00:51.486 --> 00:52.617
and three closets

00:52.704 --> 00:54.837
and I lived here first.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.057
Maybe we need to start thinking

00:57.144 --> 00:59.581
about getting our own place.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.366
We could, you know,
the wedding is almost paid off

01:02.453 --> 01:04.542
and we can just start putting
aside a little bit of money

01:04.629 --> 01:06.066
for a down payment on a house.

01:06.153 --> 01:07.893
And that'll mean
living on a budget

01:07.980 --> 01:11.810
so I hope you're willing to rein
in your highfalutin' lifestyle.

01:11.897 --> 01:14.074
Highfalutin'? It's not
peanut butter and caviar

01:14.161 --> 01:16.206
I'm bringing to work
every day in that paper bag.

01:16.293 --> 01:19.296
Yes, but you're washing it down
with a four-dollar soy latte.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.299
The coffee in the
teachers' lounge is hot mud.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.823
It's nothing but
powdered creamer

01:24.910 --> 01:26.825
and I'm not an animal!

01:28.523 --> 01:30.220
Maybe you could make
a few extra bucks

01:30.307 --> 01:32.048
tutoring some stupid kid.

01:32.135 --> 01:35.530
Oh, are you gonna start paying
me for these conversations?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.488
- Now you're just being mean.
- Little bit.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.709
Maybe you could get a second
job as a security guard

01:40.796 --> 01:42.711
or a bouncer or, here we go

01:42.798 --> 01:45.409
rollerblading guitarist, huh?

01:45.496 --> 01:47.803
Hey, find a street corner,
you tippy-tap

01:47.890 --> 01:50.371
I'll rock and roll, we'll see
whose hat fills up quicker.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.721
Time and place, buddy,
time and place.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.201
[chuckles]

01:54.288 --> 01:59.510
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:59.597 --> 02:03.732
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:14.351 --> 02:15.526
I'm telling you, Samuel,
you're gonna have

02:15.613 --> 02:17.093
a great time
on this fishing trip.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.399
That's what you said last year

02:18.486 --> 02:20.227
then Chips Ahoy
sank the Bismarck.

02:21.532 --> 02:22.707
I understand your trepidation

02:22.794 --> 02:24.100
that's why this year
we're taking

02:24.187 --> 02:25.623
all the necessary
safety precautions.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.886
Humpty Dumpty's staying home?

02:27.973 --> 02:30.585
Hey, that boat sinking
was about weight distribution

02:30.672 --> 02:31.803
not my actual weight.

02:31.890 --> 02:32.848
So the problem is

02:32.935 --> 02:34.284
we didn't take enough fat men.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.808
Technically, yes.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.288
If I were you,
I'd be more concerned

02:38.375 --> 02:40.247
with the cold weather
and the lake freezing over.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.291
I went ice fishing
with him one time--

02:41.378 --> 02:43.989
Here we go.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.557
The middle of a frozen lake
with a 300-pound man.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.125
Somebody cracked their knuckles,
I almost peed myself.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.475
[chuckles]

02:51.562 --> 02:52.650
Christina.

02:52.737 --> 02:53.999
Hey, Mike.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.697
Carl, can I talk to you?

02:55.784 --> 02:57.916
Samuel, why don't you show
me what's in the pie case.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.049
You know better than me
what's in the pie case.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.138
Move it.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.534
[clears throat]

03:06.621 --> 03:07.970
What's on your mind?

03:08.057 --> 03:09.624
Well, I just wanted
to give you back

03:09.711 --> 03:11.539
some stuff you left at my house.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.975
Oh. You know I could've just

03:13.062 --> 03:14.498
swung by your place
and grabbed it.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.674
Well, that might have
been a little awkward

03:16.761 --> 03:18.285
because James moved back in.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.330
Oh.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.332
You and your ex-husband
are playing house again, huh?

03:22.419 --> 03:23.638
We're trying to make it work.

03:23.725 --> 03:24.900
Well, I hope
the second time's a charm

03:24.987 --> 03:26.118
'cause he really messed up
the first one

03:26.206 --> 03:27.555
but you know that,
you divorced him.

03:27.642 --> 03:30.166
Ooh, just took a nasty turn.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.776
Hold it together, Carl.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.038
[Samuel]
Christina's rising

03:33.125 --> 03:34.562
crossing to the door

03:34.649 --> 03:35.998
giving him that half smile

03:36.085 --> 03:38.087
with the mixture
of pity and relief.

03:38.174 --> 03:41.133
Oh, we've all been on
the bad end of that smile.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.700
Uh-oh, he's going in for a hug.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.963
Abort, Carl, abort.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.444
She blocked it with a handshake.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.534
And now he's kind of
hugging her hand.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.102
Aw, the humanity.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.930
Oh, this is horrible to watch.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.324
And I saw my entire village
burned down by rebels.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.022
What's happening now?

04:00.109 --> 04:01.937
Well, Christina's walking out

04:02.024 --> 04:03.678
uh, Carl's trying
not to look as she leaves..

04:03.765 --> 04:04.983
That's smart. Don't look, Carl.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.855
Uh-oh, he's looking.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.726
Five, four, three, two--

04:08.813 --> 04:11.425
[Carl crying]
'Christina, why?'

04:11.512 --> 04:14.036
[instrumental music]

04:14.123 --> 04:16.995
Alright, Rudolph, work with me.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.215
Stay, boy.

04:19.302 --> 04:20.825
Stay.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.613
'What the hell?'

04:25.700 --> 04:27.267
Molly, is that you?

04:27.354 --> 04:28.616
What are you doing?

04:28.703 --> 04:30.182
It's dangerous down here.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.749
Yeah, because people
keep throwing

04:31.836 --> 04:34.535
boxes of pots down the stairs!

04:34.622 --> 04:37.973
Oh, boy, I haven't been
down here in years.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.236
This used to be your dad's
favorite room in the house.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.238
Yeah, I remember,
he used to come down here

04:42.325 --> 04:43.848
Friday night,
and we wouldn't see him

04:43.935 --> 04:46.329
until he'd stumble up
the stairs for Sunday Mass.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.550
It-it's actually
a really nice space.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.247
There's even a bathroom
and a shower.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.293
It's like a little apartment.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.425
It might be perfect
for a newlywed couple

04:55.512 --> 04:57.601
trying to start a family.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.038
Are you talking about
me and Mike living down here?

05:00.125 --> 05:01.083
Why not?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.519
We can have a yard sale and pawn

05:02.606 --> 05:04.391
all this crap off
on our neighbors.

05:04.478 --> 05:07.132
I, I think,
by the time I get pregnant

05:07.219 --> 05:09.221
Mike and I will be able
to afford a place of our own.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.222
Oh, of course you will.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.223
All you got to do is give up

05:11.311 --> 05:12.964
the European vacations

05:13.051 --> 05:14.966
the mani-pedis, the day spa

05:15.053 --> 05:17.055
and your membership
in the Shoe Of The Week Club.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.669
I, I really could
make it sweet down here.

05:21.756 --> 05:24.324
[instrumental music]

05:25.847 --> 05:27.065
Look on the bright side.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.589
You've been worrying
about whether or not

05:28.676 --> 05:30.199
you guys were ever gonna
get back together again

05:30.286 --> 05:31.331
and now you know.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.985
What a relief, huh?

05:34.072 --> 05:37.119
Man, she wanted no trace of me.

05:37.206 --> 05:39.295
Gave me back my toenail clippers

05:39.382 --> 05:41.253
and my "Home of the whopper"
underpants.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.170
But she'll always
have those memories.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.956
I know I won't forget 'em,
and I just heard about it.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.915
You didn't actually
clip your toenails

05:51.002 --> 05:51.960
in front of her, did you?

05:52.047 --> 05:53.353
I hid nothing from that woman.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.224
Women like a little mystery.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.531
They don't like
stepping on toenails.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.186
I may not bounce back from this.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.753
This is the kind of
hurt that won't go away.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.102
Oh, stop it.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.582
I've seen you get
shot down in a bar

06:05.669 --> 06:07.149
twenty five times in one night

06:07.236 --> 06:08.498
and three times
by the same woman.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.282
You're like
a human whack-a-mole.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.763
I'm just an empty shell of a man

06:12.850 --> 06:14.635
clinging to a box
of what could've been.

06:14.722 --> 06:15.723
Yeah.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.640
You know what you need?

06:19.727 --> 06:21.293
Fishing with the fellas.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.515
I can't carry around a fishing
pole and this heavy heart.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.430
You say that now,
but wait until you're out

06:27.517 --> 06:29.954
in the fresh air,
reeling in the walleyes

06:30.041 --> 06:33.131
breathing in the magnificent
splendor of God's country.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.872
I wouldn't have a good time,
and you guys don't want

06:34.959 --> 06:37.179
to spend the weekend around
a heartbroken, lonely man

06:37.266 --> 06:40.269
desperately needing
a shoulder to cry on.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.358
You know best. See you Monday.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.884
[instrumental music]

06:51.280 --> 06:52.542
Mom, where have you been?

06:52.629 --> 06:53.674
The yard crap crazies

06:53.761 --> 06:55.763
are gonna be here any minute.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.505
You can't have a yard sale
without Kahlua and coffee.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.115
It's a Flynn tradition.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.638
This is our first yard sale.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.423
And so it begins.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.339
Where do we put
the big-ticket items?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.559
We can't sell
prescription drugs.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.082
They'll sell.

07:11.169 --> 07:13.128
They took these painkillers
off the market.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.303
Just 'cause a couple
of lightweights

07:14.390 --> 07:15.870
tried to outrun a train

07:15.957 --> 07:18.220
party's over for everybody.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.700
I'm pretty sure it's illegal.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.658
So is drinking in public,
but here we are.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.879
Put them on the table
with Victoria's bong

07:24.966 --> 07:26.489
and your vibrator.

07:26.576 --> 07:27.969
It's a neck massager.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.188
Then use it on your neck!

07:34.584 --> 07:36.934
Oh, my God! Did we get evicted?

07:38.545 --> 07:41.330
I am too pretty
to live out on the street.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.289
I told you ten times,
we're having a yard sale.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.988
You made the sign.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.207
Go upstairs and clean out
your closet.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.731
No bras or panties.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.081
I don't want to
turn the hose on anybody.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.823
Those are more eBay items,
anyway.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.086
Japanese fellas eat those up.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.391
Literally.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.048
Oh, my God.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.485
First customer of the day

08:05.572 --> 08:07.661
and they're showing up
in a mobile home.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.750
Probably one of those
crazy hoarders.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.142
Mom, we're not
here to cure anybody.

08:11.229 --> 08:14.885
We're here to unload our crap.
Welcome!

08:14.972 --> 08:16.191
Hi-ho, ladies!

08:16.278 --> 08:18.628
Hey, Harry.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.021
Where'd you get the cool wheels?

08:20.108 --> 08:22.066
You mean the '87 Winnebago
Chieftain

08:22.153 --> 08:24.112
that seats ten, sleeps four

08:24.199 --> 08:27.245
and gets over three miles
to the gallon in the cit-ay?

08:28.377 --> 08:29.552
I thought you drove a Vespa.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.033
That's just to
impress the chicks.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.036
This rig's for weekend fun.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.820
I inherited it
from my Grandpa Kevin.

08:36.907 --> 08:40.041
Along with my love of adventure
and child-bearing hips.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.565
Uh-huh.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.567
Hey, maybe some of
Mike's old pants will fit you.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.569
- Oh.
- And we take traveler's checks.

08:46.656 --> 08:49.746
- Never leave home without 'em!
- Ha-ha!

08:49.833 --> 08:52.923
I'm also looking for colonial
glass and state spoons.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.012
Well, you never know
what you're gonna find.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.145
I need Wyoming and Utah
to complete my collection.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.016
Happy hunting.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.847
Hey, Samuel.
Mike should be out in a minute.

folk art or tube socks?

We've got tube socks aplenty

a Sanford and Son lunchbox.

Is there a fitting room,
or should I just

09:22.779 --> 09:24.564
try these on behind the bush?

09:24.651 --> 09:26.870
Harry, drop my pants
and get in the RV.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.743

Are those my socks?

and so should you.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.978
Get out of that car right now!

09:48.065 --> 09:49.676
No. You can't make me go.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.982
I will grab you
by them tiny ears

09:52.069 --> 09:54.158

through that window!

Michael, get him out of that car

10:01.513 --> 10:03.211

that recreational vehicle.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.778
Nana, he said
he doesn't want to go

10:04.865 --> 10:06.127
and I don't think it's
a good idea to make him.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.695
I knew I could
depend on you, Michael.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.435
Now I can have a lovely weekend

10:10.522 --> 10:12.786
with Brother Heywood as planned.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.570
Wait, I kind of said no,
didn't I?

10:14.657 --> 10:16.572
And I said,
"Thanks for taking him".

10:18.443 --> 10:20.576

living in the wild

10:40.901 --> 10:44.034
but in some creepy cabin,
filled with old magazines

10:44.121 --> 10:46.558
and mannequin parts.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.952
Oh, I got this beauty
from my grandpa.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.737
This was his pride and joy.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.652
Gramps loved the outdoors, huh?

10:52.739 --> 10:55.524
No. But he loved antiquing.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.874
Every summer, he and his
best buddy, Steve

10:57.961 --> 11:01.008
would leave the wives behind
and drive from San Francisco

11:01.095 --> 11:05.273
to Key West, purchasing curios
and knickknacks all the way.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.493

in a camper buying antiques?

11:09.843 --> 11:10.974
Huh.

11:13.063 --> 11:16.545
I will say they kept this thing
in pristine condition.

11:16.632 --> 11:20.244
Ah, grandpa and Steve
were both very immaculate.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.291

11:42.571 --> 11:44.486
That's why we brought beer, too.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.968
Look, the best thing
you can do right now

11:48.055 --> 11:49.839
is clear your head,
get out of the city

11:49.926 --> 11:52.189
and leave your old,
familiar routine behind.

can never love a man like me.

18:53.262 --> 18:56.222
Remember when I said
those exact same words?

18:56.309 --> 18:58.789
It was right before I met Molly.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.269
I remember.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.880
But a very good friend
told me something.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.795
He said,
"Mike, you're a good man.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.928
And out there is a good woman

19:07.015 --> 19:09.278
who's waiting to meet you."

19:09.365 --> 19:11.062
- I was right.
- Yes, you were.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.021
And I guarantee you..

19:13.108 --> 19:14.153
...that there's a woman
out there

19:14.240 --> 19:16.590
who will love you
for who you are.

19:16.677 --> 19:19.332
Nah, nobody wants a guy like me.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.768
Are you kidding me?

19:20.855 --> 19:22.291
You're a handsome man.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.814
Fit, well-groomed.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.165
Nobody takes better care
of their toenails.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.646
I always took pride in my feet.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.606
A man's feet
are his calling card.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.130
It's a shame you got to
put shoes on those beauties.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.436
A-and you know,
since Christina dumped me

19:36.523 --> 19:37.959
I've been working out
like a fiend.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.700
Yeah, mostly core work
and upper-body stuff.

19:39.787 --> 19:40.875
I was gonna comment

19:40.962 --> 19:42.833
but I didn't want
to embarrass you.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.532
Oh, no reason to be
embarrassed about this.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.011
- Huh?
- Wow. Look at that.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.666
It's like somebody cut
a pan of brownies.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.538
Right? Touch 'em.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.627
- Really?
- Yeah. I insist.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.324
Alright.

19:55.411 --> 19:57.587
- Huh?
- Wow. Those are hard.

19:58.849 --> 19:59.981
Hey, you guys, we're gonna..

20:00.068 --> 20:01.374
Ah, geez.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.508
Can't men just
camp together anymore?

Yeah, we found a shortcut
on the way back.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.756
It was on, uh, Electric Avenue.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.105

20:38.498 --> 20:40.543
It's not the same

I meant the basement.

Yeah, until then,
it could be my man-cave.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.424

my air hockey game down here
