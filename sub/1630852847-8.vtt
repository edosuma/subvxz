00:12.971 --> 00:14.264
- Previously on "Bel-Air"...

00:14.305 --> 00:16.349
- I've always been enamored
with your work.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.268
- I'm not sure I'm ready

00:18.309 --> 00:20.895
just to show
any of my latest pieces yet.

00:20.937 --> 00:23.106
- You made that choice
to set your art aside, not me.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.108
- Part of me
resents you for it.

00:25.150 --> 00:28.361
- People are even saying that
you'd be an ideal candidate

00:28.403 --> 00:29.988
for the Neeman
Artistic Fellowship.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.365
- What?
That's quite an honor.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.534
- "Thirsty Chef," huh?
- Ugh.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.619
- People are loving
"the Thirsty Chef."

00:36.661 --> 00:38.121
- I don't know.
It just didn't seem like you.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.581
- It's not.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.125
- I don't understand why
it matters if my dad's a cop.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.418
- He's the chief of police.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.003
And if it didn't matter,
why didn't you tell me?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.838
- It's not like you told me
what your dad did for a living.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.506
- Oh, sorry.
I can't answer that question

00:48.548 --> 00:49.841
'cause I haven't seen
the sorry-ass nigga

00:49.883 --> 00:50.884
since he walked out.

00:50.925 --> 00:51.968
- Will's been floating the idea

00:52.010 --> 00:53.636
of heading back to Philly.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.181
Think of all the opportunities
that he could have here.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.141
- Sounds like
you tryna take my place.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.809
- Hey, uh, you seen Will?

00:59.851 --> 01:01.394
- No, sorry.
- LAPD!

01:01.436 --> 01:03.688
We need to speak with
the owner of the house.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.732
You're Chief Wilkes' daughter?
- Yes.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.901
- Party's over.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.117
- Whoo!

01:16.159 --> 01:18.411
Look at that baby fly.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.789
Yeah, ol' Yamacraw
still got it.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.290
All right, come on, son.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.875
Let's catch up
with Assemblyman Hernandez.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.211
- Can we use the golf carts
on the back nine?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.046
They're complimentary.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.131
- Walking's good for my spirit,

01:30.173 --> 01:31.966
and it's part
of your punishment.

01:32.008 --> 01:36.096

01:36.137 --> 01:38.348
- [sighs]

01:40.225 --> 01:41.851
- All right, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.771
- Hey, uh, remind me again.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.565
Why isn't Will being punished,
hmm?

01:47.607 --> 01:49.818
- His punishment's on hold
because it's his birthday.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.319
- Look, this whole thing
is being blown

01:51.361 --> 01:52.696
way out of proportion.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.364
There was minimal damage
to the house.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.574
Plus, the cops only got us
on a noise violation.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.576
- You were lucky Lisa was there
and called her dad

01:58.618 --> 02:00.453
and I was able to persuade
the police commissioner

02:00.495 --> 02:02.872
to keep the matter quiet.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.667
- Wait, you cut a deal
with the police commissioner?

02:05.709 --> 02:08.503
- I just pointed out that
my opponent in the election

02:08.545 --> 02:09.963
is the police chief,

02:10.005 --> 02:13.008
and that it might appear
that our family was targeted

02:13.049 --> 02:14.801
the night of your party.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.512
- Holy shit, uh...

02:17.554 --> 02:20.682
thanks, Dad.
I mean it.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.519
- You're welcome.
Consider it an act of grace.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.859
I'll do everything in my power
to safeguard your future.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.570
You understand?

you and Uncle Phil

on layaway for a little bit.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.542
This gonna be
the best birthday gift ever.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.045
- Well, you only turn 17 once,
right?

02:50.086 --> 02:52.839
Oh, and maybe we shouldn't talk
about the party situation.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.050
- Trust me, I'm not
tryna stress my mama out

02:55.091 --> 02:56.301
any more than I already have.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.428
- Mm-hmm.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.263
- Hey!
- Oh!

03:00.305 --> 03:02.349
Look at her!
Hey, Mama!

03:02.390 --> 03:04.726
[both laughing]

03:04.768 --> 03:06.853
Hey, you made it.
- I love you, baby!

03:06.895 --> 03:09.564
Oh, boy, I wouldn't dare miss
your birthday.

03:09.606 --> 03:13.693
Look at you.
Ooh, I missed you.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.071
I missed you.
I missed you so much.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.572

03:21.368 --> 03:22.911
Seriously, Viv,

03:22.952 --> 03:24.954
it is--it's real good
to see you.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.540
And thank you and Phil
for flying me out here

03:27.582 --> 03:29.626
and for putting up
with this one.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.127
- We're just doing
what families do:

03:31.169 --> 03:32.587
looking out for each other.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.464
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

Oh, boy. Wow.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.011
Boy, I swear you done

03:40.053 --> 03:42.097
- Oh, yeah. No, our coach
be having the whole team

03:42.138 --> 03:44.432
do Pilates and stuff, you know,
strengthen our cores

03:44.474 --> 03:45.934
and align our backs
and all that.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.560

in the country.

03:47.602 --> 03:51.022

[soft R&B in background]

03:55.443 --> 03:56.861
- Yeah.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.863
Tell me
this is the follow-up video

03:58.905 --> 04:00.407
to the one
that put you on the map.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
- No, not yet.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.077
Gotta build up anticipation.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.662
Otherwise,
it can get played out quick.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.790
- Yeah, but the numbers

04:08.832 --> 04:11.292
on that
sexy chef video, though--

04:11.334 --> 04:13.336
3 million views and counting.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.131
And these regular old tutorials
of yours

04:16.172 --> 04:17.716
get a fraction of those hits.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.134
I don't want you
to lose momentum.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.719
- I won't.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.513
- All right.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.973
Well, what's the holdup?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.850
- I told my parents
it was a one-off thing,

04:26.891 --> 04:29.144
so I need
to prepare them for more.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.937
- Your parents?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.939
What, you want them
to sign a permission slip?

04:32.981 --> 04:35.233
- Kylo, there are knives
within my reach.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.735
Do you really wanna go there?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.194
- [laughs] No, it's my bad.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.863
I'm playing.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.489
But I'd hate to see
an opportunity

04:41.531 --> 04:43.742

04:49.706 --> 04:53.418

the little things? *

04:55.795 --> 04:56.755
- Boom.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.922
- Don't you know
you're supposed to

04:57.964 --> 04:59.674
let the highest-ranking
politician win?

04:59.716 --> 05:02.719
- Well, Assemblyman,
I never learned to lose.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.097
- Why don't we let the caddies

05:06.139 --> 05:08.975
stretch their legs
while we ride on ahead?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.560
- If you say so.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.855
- We will see how we do
at this hole, all right?

05:13.897 --> 05:15.982
- [laughs]
You're feeling really good.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.364
- So, Assemblyman Hernandez,

05:22.405 --> 05:24.783
can I count on
your endorsement?

05:24.824 --> 05:28.203
- I like you, Phil,
but you're in a tight race,

05:28.244 --> 05:30.997
and you don't appear
to have your family in order.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.833
- My family
isn't on the ballot.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.418
- But they are
in the voters' minds.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.253
From what I hear,
your wife's vanished

05:37.295 --> 05:38.588
from the campaign trail

05:38.630 --> 05:40.006
since her outburst
at a charity event.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.550
Your daughter's
posting thirst trap videos,

05:42.592 --> 05:44.052
and your son's throwing parties

05:44.094 --> 05:46.096
that get shut down
by the police.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.265
- All that's irrelevant, okay,
as I'm the one running for DA.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.725
There's no stain on me.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.103
- These are the realities.

05:53.144 --> 05:57.148
If you want to win...
get your family in line.

your bags upstairs.

so much fun here.

on a tennis scholarship.

Well, good for her.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.273
I haven't seen Dianne
in 20 years.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.942
How long has it been
since you were last here?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.278
- 20 years?
It was--it was your wedding.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.447
And you couldn't send
for a private plane back then.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.948
We were all broke.

I mean, we ate the leftovers

06:49.159 --> 06:51.369

for two weeks.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.704
- Yeah.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.706
Well, you don't have
that problem anymore.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.458
- You're right.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.335
A lot has changed.

Will is almost a man.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.469
And I think I might...

07:07.510 --> 07:09.679
I might tell him
about his father.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.308
- Tell him what?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.477
- Well, everything.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.686
The whole story.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.021
- Wait, have you thought
long and hard

07:18.063 --> 07:20.982
about how this might
affect Will?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.151
- I realize that it--
it may hurt him,

07:23.193 --> 07:24.402
and he might be upset,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.321
but if we explain our reasons--

07:26.363 --> 07:28.239
- Reasons?
He might hate us.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.593
- Okay, wait.
Mom doesn't cook like this.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.011
- Well, that's because
while I was perfecting

19:38.053 --> 19:39.554
my skills in the kitchen,

19:39.596 --> 19:42.807
your mother was too busy
running out in them streets.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.018
- All right, I need details.
Spill.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.978
- Did she ever tell you
about the time

19:47.020 --> 19:50.648
that she climbed up on stage
at a D'Angelo concert?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.235
- Okay, excuse me.
I did not climb up.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.570
He invited me on stage.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.530
- No, I don't recall him
asking you anything.

19:57.572 --> 19:59.157
- He invited me up
with his eyes.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.327
[laughter]

20:02.369 --> 20:04.829
- So, Auntie,
you have any more secrets

20:04.871 --> 20:07.123
about my mother
that you care to divulge?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.084
- Okay.
- Oh.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.545
- Ooh, did she tell you,
ooh, about the time

20:12.587 --> 20:15.173
that I bought her
her first canvas and paint set?

20:15.215 --> 20:18.885
- Okay, to distract me so you
could go talk on the phone

20:18.927 --> 20:20.512
when you were supposed
to be babysitting me.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.846
- That's a lie.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.349
I did it because I saw
you had talent.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.685
You never give me credit
for that.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.520
- Mm. What you can
take credit for

20:28.561 --> 20:30.271
is taking me
to the beach on my birthday.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.606
It'd be dope. It'd be cool.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.233
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.528
- I can meet you both for
lunch, if that's okay with you.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.699
- Yeah, of course, it is.
Yeah.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.992
It'll give us
all time to catch up.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.536
- Wraps.
And let's get into this food.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.829
- Okay.
Let's do it. Let's eat.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.706
Look, I grated some cheese.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.708
- Oh, you grated
the cheese this time.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.084
- Yes, you know...
- Wow!

20:51.126 --> 20:52.794
She got to Bel-Air,
she started to use the grater.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.629
- I'm trying to step it up.
- By the way,

20:54.671 --> 20:56.589
happy birthday, Will.
- Hey, thanks, man.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.224
- So? Did he agree to meet?

21:06.266 --> 21:07.684
- Yeah. It's all arranged.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.353
No press. Just you and Wilkes.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.772
- Good. Good.
Thank you, Geoffrey.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.694
- You look knackered, man.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.738
What else is going on?

21:23.825 --> 21:24.868
- Well...

21:27.120 --> 21:30.165
Vy might tell Will
about his dad.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.626
- And you don't want that.
For good reason?

21:33.668 --> 21:35.086
- Well, it might derail
all the progress

21:35.128 --> 21:36.463
he's made, you know?

21:36.504 --> 21:39.466
- Yeah.
I suppose it could.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.304
- Which is why
I need your help.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.265
[quiet dramatic music]

21:47.307 --> 21:50.810
* *

21:50.852 --> 21:53.772
I need you to see to it that
Lou doesn't come near Will.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.607
I mean, the last thing
he needs in his life

21:55.648 --> 21:59.569
is more hurt
and disappointment.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.742
* *

22:05.784 --> 22:07.786
- * Don't try to fight it *

22:07.827 --> 22:09.412
* I know you like it

22:09.454 --> 22:11.790
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

22:11.831 --> 22:13.958
* Taking over like a virus *

22:14.000 --> 22:15.293
* Let's start a riot *

22:15.335 --> 22:17.003
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

22:17.045 --> 22:18.421
- Ooh!

22:18.463 --> 22:20.131
- See, Ma?

22:20.173 --> 22:22.634
A piece of home is always near,
no matter how far I go.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.762
- Mmm. Mmm.

22:25.804 --> 22:28.765
A little bit of Philly
definitely goes a long way.

22:28.807 --> 22:30.433
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.769
- Shh, this is crazy.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.646
- It is beautiful.

22:34.688 --> 22:38.066
Sky and mountains and ocean.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.319
- Mm-hmm.
- Really is like a dream.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.363
- Exactly.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.489
Definitely took a minute,

22:44.531 --> 22:46.783
but I think I'm starting
to like Cali now.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.704
- I'm proud of you, son.

22:52.122 --> 22:55.166
Despite how much
I miss my baby,

22:55.208 --> 22:59.295
I am happy to see you
thriving out here.

22:59.337 --> 23:04.175
- Yeah, I mean, if it wasn't
for Uncle Phil and Aunt Viv,

23:04.217 --> 23:07.429
if they hadn't stuck by me,
I don't know where I would be.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.222
- Wait, hold up.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.016
You just gonna give
all the props

23:11.057 --> 23:12.892
to your aunt and uncle
for the past few months

23:12.934 --> 23:14.561
when I'm the one
who raised you on my own?

23:14.602 --> 23:18.189
- Yo, no way.
I see you, Ma.

23:18.231 --> 23:21.109
I mean, if it wasn't for you
sending me out here,

23:21.151 --> 23:24.654
I probably would've never
made it to this birthday.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.199
So thank you.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.326
- No, thank you, baby.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.703
Thank you for being the man

23:31.745 --> 23:34.289
that I always knew
you were meant to be.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.708
I just don't want you
to ever forget the whole story

23:36.750 --> 23:38.960
of where you come from, okay?

23:39.002 --> 23:41.546
[people on ride screaming]

23:41.588 --> 23:42.714
- I hear you.

23:42.756 --> 23:44.257
- Come here.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.887
I love you, baby.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.765
- I love you too.
Wanna go ride that first one?

23:51.806 --> 23:53.099
- I do.
- All right, let's go.

23:53.141 --> 23:53.933
- Yeah.

23:53.975 --> 23:57.395
[soft, punchy music]

23:57.437 --> 24:00.482
* *

24:00.523 --> 24:02.108
- * Remind me
what the caddy say *

24:02.150 --> 24:04.402
* She know I'm a sunny
lemonade *

24:04.444 --> 24:06.738
* For the low,
what you do for the money? *

24:06.780 --> 24:09.908
* Oh no, oh no, oh,
can't play me for no dummy *

24:09.949 --> 24:11.326
* I need VVS...*

24:11.368 --> 24:14.788
- Does this really reflect
who you are?

24:14.829 --> 24:17.332
* *

24:17.374 --> 24:19.250
- * Care if I'm crazy,
who she swervin'? *

24:19.292 --> 24:20.585
* Mm mm *

24:20.627 --> 24:21.711
* Mm mmm *

24:33.473 --> 24:34.683
- You're late.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.059
- Police business.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.852
See, I'm already
a public servant.

24:37.894 --> 24:40.313
- You can quit preening.
There's no cameras around.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.482
- Well, unlike you,
I take the law seriously.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.609
I don't bend it or buy my way
out of following it

24:44.651 --> 24:46.486
like you did
at Carlton's party.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.655
- Your daughter was a guest,

24:48.697 --> 24:50.573
yet no one checked
her alcohol intake.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.033
So you can quit
the saint routine.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.202
We both know
why it doesn't suit you.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.454
- Assemblyman Hernandez
said you had a proposal.

24:56.496 --> 24:58.331
- I do.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.625
This special election
has gotten complicated

25:00.667 --> 25:02.043
since you jumped in.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.670
Now you and I could split
the Democratic vote,

25:03.712 --> 25:04.963
pushing Crawford to the win.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.715
Here's how we avoid that.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.967
Our debate should decide
which one of us continues

25:09.009 --> 25:11.011
to stand in the election.

25:11.052 --> 25:13.638
Whoever's leading afterwards

25:13.680 --> 25:16.224
becomes the sole
Democratic candidate.

25:16.266 --> 25:17.434
Loser bows out,

25:17.475 --> 25:19.310
throwing his full support
behind the winner.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.441
- The debate decides it all.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.526
- Exactly.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.319
Do we have a deal?

25:28.361 --> 25:34.075
* *

25:40.874 --> 25:42.542
- Hey, Kylo.
- Yo.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.128
- So I came up
with four other video ideas

25:45.170 --> 25:48.173
outside of "Thirsty Chef,"
and they're all fire.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.382
- Yeah.

25:49.424 --> 25:51.634
I was worried
you were gonna be like this.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.887
- What is that supposed
to mean?

25:53.928 --> 25:55.847
- It means I did some research
on you, Hilary.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.140
You dropped out of college.

25:57.182 --> 26:00.518
You left two or three jobs,
internships.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.103
You even quit
those online personas

26:02.145 --> 26:03.646
you used to try on
just for fun.

26:03.688 --> 26:05.523
- Yeah, so what?

26:05.565 --> 26:08.485
I--I've been finding myself.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.862
- Well, you have a pattern.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.822
As soon as something
doesn't go your way,

26:12.864 --> 26:15.241
you're pretty quick to take off
on another venture.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.493
It's an easy habit to form

26:16.534 --> 26:19.371
when you never have to pay
a bill.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.872
- You know what?
Fuck you, Kylo.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.957
Don't try to psychoanalyze me

26:22.999 --> 26:24.709
just because
I don't do what you want.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.503
- Don't spin this on me.

26:26.544 --> 26:29.964
You hated that video till
I posted it and it skyrocketed

26:30.006 --> 26:31.132
and earned you
all your sponsors.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.677
- And I will keep
all my sponsors, okay?

26:33.718 --> 26:35.637
I can do it my way without you.

26:35.679 --> 26:40.308
- Yeah, except if you leave,
all the content you've created

26:40.350 --> 26:43.353
in this house belongs to me,
and you owe me a kill fee.

26:43.395 --> 26:46.773
Pretty big one.

26:46.815 --> 26:49.109
You didn't read your contract,
did you?

26:55.949 --> 26:58.243
- Hello, Mrs. Banks.
So good to see you again.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.078
- Oh, thank you so much,
Chef Armstrong.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.871
I'm so looking forward
to another great meal today.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.331
- You know
I won't let you down.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.295
- Sorry, guys.
Sorry for being late.

27:09.337 --> 27:10.839
- No biggie, Aunt Viv.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.841
- It gave us enough time
to spot Christina Aguilera

27:12.882 --> 27:14.634
walk into this fancy jawn.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.386
- Yo, we saw Riri last time
we were here,

27:16.428 --> 27:17.679
right, Aunt Viv?
- Oh.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.264
- She was dope.
- Oh, she sure was.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.267
And she made sure
she got her money's worth.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.060
- Oh, so you--you come here
often, baby?

27:24.102 --> 27:25.812
- Yeah, yeah.
We try to bring the kids

27:25.854 --> 27:27.856
out somewhere nice for dinner
at least once a week,

27:27.897 --> 27:29.274
you know,
to broaden their palate.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.277
- Yeah.
The seafood here is bussin'.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.695
- So, Viv,

27:33.737 --> 27:37.073
tell me what's got you
so busy these days.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.826
- Well, there's a gallerist
who's nominated me

27:39.868 --> 27:41.536
for a Nieman Fellowship.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.329
It's basically like
a genius grant

27:43.371 --> 27:44.914
to visual artists.

27:44.956 --> 27:46.624
- So you're painting again?

27:46.666 --> 27:48.835
- Yeah. Yeah.
Aunt Viv's art is crazy.

27:48.877 --> 27:51.296
She be having people paying
like 20 Gs for her stuff.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.422
- Shh.
- Really?

27:52.464 --> 27:54.382
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great to hear.

27:54.424 --> 27:58.094
I--I was kind of disappointed
when you stopped painting,

27:58.136 --> 28:00.138
you know, especially after
all the sacrifices

28:00.180 --> 28:02.766
that me and Mama made
so you could become an artist.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.310
- Oh, forgive me
for letting you down.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.437
Not like you knew
what I was going through.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.731
After all, though, you were
so busy running after Lou.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.734
- Let's--let's not go there.
- Go where?

28:12.776 --> 28:14.444
- Good afternoon,
ladies and gentleman.

28:14.486 --> 28:15.487
May I take your order?

28:15.528 --> 28:16.905
- Yes. Yes, you may.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.324
And we will enjoy this lunch
on my birthday.

28:19.366 --> 28:21.659
No side orders
of extra energy necessary.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.330
- Happy birthday.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.831
- Thank you.

28:28.541 --> 28:32.379
[edgy music]

28:32.420 --> 28:34.255
- I've been thinking, Phil.

28:34.297 --> 28:35.340
Maybe you should try

28:35.382 --> 28:37.676
a different tack
with Will's dad, huh?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.302
- If you knew Lou,
you wouldn't say that.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.680
He's not someone Will needs
in his life right now.

28:43.181 --> 28:45.183
- Why should you get
to decide that?

28:45.225 --> 28:47.769
Why not Will?
Why not his father?

28:51.356 --> 28:53.024
I think about my son.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.695
You take a minute and think
about Carlton and then tell me

28:56.736 --> 28:58.822
what you would do if you were
in Lou's position, huh?

28:58.863 --> 29:03.284
* *

29:07.539 --> 29:09.582
- Just do what I asked.

29:09.624 --> 29:11.543
- I'm not that kind of brother.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.837
Doesn't sit right with me.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.255
- Too bad.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.382
You work for me.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.302
- Understood.

29:31.896 --> 29:35.525
- Ma, can we talk, like,
straight up?

29:35.567 --> 29:37.027
No holding back?

29:37.068 --> 29:38.737
- About what, baby?

29:40.739 --> 29:42.282
- About my dad.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.284
You and Aunt Viv got me
thinking about him

29:44.325 --> 29:46.161
and what I remember.

29:47.245 --> 29:49.539
- She shouldn't have
drudged him up.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.791
- Honestly, I've been thinking
about it for years,

29:51.833 --> 29:53.418
but I just feel like you
never talk about him,

29:53.460 --> 29:54.794
and every time
I try to bring him up,

29:54.836 --> 29:56.629
you just constantly put me off.

29:56.671 --> 29:59.049
- I mean, it's because
I didn't wanna--I didn't wanna

29:59.090 --> 30:01.259
bad-mouth him in front of you,

30:01.301 --> 30:02.886
especially when
you were younger.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.471
- Well, I'm older.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.015
All right?

30:07.057 --> 30:08.767
And I wanna know everything.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.727
What was he like?
Good and bad.

30:10.769 --> 30:13.897
What qualities
do I get from him?

30:13.938 --> 30:16.232
I mean,
there's gotta be a few, right?

30:16.274 --> 30:17.525
- [chuckles]

30:19.319 --> 30:22.989
[sighs]

30:24.783 --> 30:28.787
- Your daddy, Lou--

30:28.828 --> 30:31.915
he was complicated, baby,

30:31.956 --> 30:33.291
and you don't need his failures

30:33.333 --> 30:35.251
and his shortcomings
in your head.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.295
You know, you're gonna be
a better man

30:37.337 --> 30:39.339
than he could ever be.
- Mom, Mom, Mom, stop.

30:39.381 --> 30:40.423
Stop, all right?

30:40.465 --> 30:44.344
I see what you're doing.
It's not okay.

30:44.386 --> 30:47.222
I'm tired of stonewalling,
all right?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.099
I'm 17 now.
I'm not 7.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.434
I wanna know the full story,
a'ight?

30:51.476 --> 30:53.520

30:57.649 --> 31:00.777
- Okay. Um...

31:00.819 --> 31:02.821
Tss. Ha.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.992
Your father
was a half-ass dreamer

31:08.034 --> 31:11.579
jumping from one get-rich-quick
scheme to another.

31:13.331 --> 31:17.002
And I believed
his promises and his lies.

31:19.546 --> 31:21.089
He owed a lot of money
all over town,

31:21.131 --> 31:23.383
and I paid his debts.

31:26.011 --> 31:29.723
He created mess,
and I cleaned it up.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.933
- Why?
- Because I was young.

31:31.975 --> 31:36.396
* *

31:36.438 --> 31:37.981
- I just can't imagine
you putting up

31:38.023 --> 31:39.816
with no man's bullshit.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.651
Sorry.

31:42.360 --> 31:46.489
- That's because I changed.
I changed once I had you.

31:46.531 --> 31:50.869
I mean, it was like Lou's spell
had been broken, and...

31:53.496 --> 31:55.248
You became my world.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.088
And that's why he ran off,

32:02.130 --> 32:06.051
baby, because...
he couldn't use me anymore.

[falsetto R&B music]

32:22.984 --> 32:24.235
- 'Sup?

32:24.277 --> 32:28.782
- So...I'm very sorry
that I went off on you.

32:30.408 --> 32:32.243
That wasn't cool.
I apologize.

32:32.285 --> 32:33.328
- Well, I appreciate that,

32:33.370 --> 32:36.373
but I would much rather hear,
like,

32:36.414 --> 32:38.208
"Jazz, you were right."

32:39.084 --> 32:42.170
- What about, "Jazz,
you're a pain in the ass"?

32:42.212 --> 32:43.505
But no, you were right.
- Okay.

32:43.546 --> 32:44.881
- I haven't told my parents
yet,

32:44.923 --> 32:48.009
but I told Kylo to fuck off,
and I quit the house.

32:48.051 --> 32:51.471
- Mmm! I bet it felt good
to stand up to Fuckboi 5000.

32:51.513 --> 32:53.348
- It really did.
It really did.

32:53.390 --> 32:56.685
But now I'm in a situation
where I'm staying at a hotel

32:56.726 --> 32:58.144
until I find my new place,

32:58.186 --> 33:01.022
and I owe Kylo $50,000
for breaking the contract.

- I'm gonna figure
something out.

33:05.235 --> 33:07.404
- I know you will.
You always do.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.656
And you fine like Chloe Bailey.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.074

you get him?

- Um...

33:22.377 --> 33:23.795
Ankle weights.
- Mm.

33:23.837 --> 33:25.338
- It's for his vertical.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.841
He's been saying that he wants
to get his bunnies up

33:27.882 --> 33:29.551
so he can catch more bodies
on fast breaks.

33:29.592 --> 33:30.760
- Okay.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.262
- I--I don't know
what it means, but...

33:32.303 --> 33:33.763
- It's very thoughtful.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.181
I don't know
if Will told you this,

33:35.223 --> 33:37.267
but when he was
about five or six,

33:37.308 --> 33:39.602
he used to beg me
to give him a brother.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.856
- That's funny.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.899
I remember,
after Ashley was born,

33:44.941 --> 33:47.152
I used to beg my parents
for a brother too.

I want you to meet someone.

34:07.380 --> 34:08.506
This is Lisa.

34:08.548 --> 34:09.758
- Hi.
- Lisa.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.134
Come on in here.

34:11.176 --> 34:12.677
Give me a hug.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.429
- It's such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Smith.

34:14.471 --> 34:15.972
And I've heard
such great things from Will.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.349
- Same.
So tell me this.

34:17.390 --> 34:20.310
Is my boy treating you
like a gentleman should?

34:20.352 --> 34:21.895
- Mm-hmm.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.104
Well, you know I wouldn't be
with him if he didn't.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.940
- Okay, see?
I like her.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.525
She's not afraid
to speak her mind,

34:27.567 --> 34:30.070
and that is exactly
what you need in a young woman.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.780
'Cause, see,
he gets wild ideas.

34:31.821 --> 34:33.239
Every now and then, you know,

34:33.281 --> 34:35.909

and sit down somewhere.

34:35.950 --> 34:38.411
- What you doin'?

34:38.453 --> 34:41.831

in the 101 traffic.

34:44.084 --> 34:45.669
- Wait, where's the food
coming from?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.379
- Roscoe's.
- Damn!

34:48.588 --> 34:50.965
It's my favorite.
It's really good.

34:51.007 --> 34:52.676
- In that case, we might
as well get it cracking

34:52.717 --> 34:55.053
with the gift opening, huh?
Let's crack open these gifts.

34:55.095 --> 34:56.805
- But maybe we should wait
until after dinner.

your gifts, baby.

Yup, yup. Your mama.

open up mine next?

- Yeah.
Yeah, I'll open it up.

the shoes Phil bought
were so expensive.

- Just couldn't let me have
this moment, could you?

36:26.644 --> 36:29.939
- For once, please do not
make this about our issues.

36:29.981 --> 36:31.858
Will is happy with his gift.
That's all that matters.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.360
Let's drop it.

around

in front of my child.

'Cause that's
what you're mad about.

came true,

so now you gotta cut me down
whenever you get a chance?

36:49.376 --> 36:52.462
- Girl, your dreams came true
because Mama supported you,

36:53.129 --> 36:56.174
Because I supported you,
and then Phil supported you.

36:56.216 --> 37:00.345
You didn't climb no mountain.
You were carried.

37:00.387 --> 37:02.263
And what I gave to you
and now to Will--

37:02.305 --> 37:04.974
it ain't flashy or dramatic
enough to be remembered

37:05.016 --> 37:07.268
or even given credit for.

- You know what's clear?

37:23.076 --> 37:25.370
What's clear is that before--
before this fancy house,

37:25.412 --> 37:28.206
I was the one who helped you
find your voice as an artist.

37:28.248 --> 37:30.542
When you needed materials,
I bought them for you.

37:30.583 --> 37:33.294
I helped you move to LA,
and I paid your bills.

37:33.336 --> 37:34.879
And the second
you didn't need me,

37:34.921 --> 37:36.715
you just--you erased me.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.967
You erased me from your life.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.886
[melancholy music]

And you want my son
to do the same thing.

37:58.737 --> 38:01.239
- Sorry, dawg.

38:08.079 --> 38:09.789
- It's always been
this way with her.

38:09.831 --> 38:12.125
The more I get,
the happier I am,

38:12.167 --> 38:13.752
the more resentful she becomes.

38:13.793 --> 38:16.212
- Mom, take a deep breath.

38:17.630 --> 38:21.384
- I'm just so sorry
you even had to witness that.

38:21.426 --> 38:23.845
- Auntie Vy said
a lot of hurtful things.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.680
- Awful things.

38:25.722 --> 38:27.891
- Have you ever stopped
to ask yourself why?

38:27.932 --> 38:31.770
Maybe, underneath
all of that...anger,

38:31.811 --> 38:34.105
she's just hurt.
- What?

38:34.147 --> 38:36.066
Vy is made of steel.

38:36.107 --> 38:37.776
Vy put herself through college.

38:37.817 --> 38:39.861
Vy raised Will on her own.

38:39.903 --> 38:44.491
Vy...took care of Mom
on her own.

38:47.535 --> 38:50.872
She's just been
doing everything.

38:50.914 --> 38:53.041
- Yeah.

38:56.086 --> 38:59.297
And that's just
a heavy expectation

38:59.339 --> 39:02.634
to put on someone,
don't you think?

39:02.676 --> 39:05.929
- And I've been doing this
to her her whole life.

39:11.309 --> 39:14.729
- Mom, I think that, uh,
you and your sister

39:14.771 --> 39:16.898
need to have a talk, you know,

39:16.940 --> 39:19.109
without all the insults,
of course.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.277
- [small laugh, sniffles]

39:24.447 --> 39:26.783
- So when did you get so wise?

39:26.825 --> 39:28.827
- Uh, I think it was the
hundredth time you told me

39:28.868 --> 39:31.746
to make it work with Will

39:31.788 --> 39:33.873
because we're family.

your party like that, son.

39:58.523 --> 40:00.483
I really didn't.

- Ma, you do know that
there's no way in hell anyone

40:06.114 --> 40:09.492
could ever erase you
from my life, ever.

40:10.994 --> 40:12.579
- Thank you, baby.

40:15.206 --> 40:18.752
In my mind, I had planned
this wonderful trip

40:18.793 --> 40:21.588
to celebrate your birthday,

40:21.629 --> 40:24.841
and your Aunt Viv
just got under my skin.

- Look, I love you, Ma,

40:26.968 --> 40:28.345
but you can't put that
all on Aunt Viv,

40:28.386 --> 40:29.971
'cause you was throwing
some low blows in there too.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.307
- Only when I was trying
to defend myself.

40:32.349 --> 40:34.726
You know, she crossed
the line first.

40:34.768 --> 40:37.062
- Hmm.
So what?

40:37.103 --> 40:39.481
You out here
waiting for an apology?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.819
- I guess this is the part
where you tell me

40:44.861 --> 40:46.905
I should be the bigger person.

40:46.946 --> 40:49.407
- I mean, it's good advice.

40:52.077 --> 40:54.829
- Will, do you mind

40:54.871 --> 40:57.582
if I speak to my sister alone
for a moment?

41:01.586 --> 41:03.088
- Make me proud.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.303
- I--
- You were right.

41:12.472 --> 41:16.851
I haven't always acknowledged
how much I received

41:16.893 --> 41:19.270
and relied upon you and Mama.

41:21.523 --> 41:23.858
I've been unfair
to both of you.

41:23.900 --> 41:26.111
I mean...

41:26.152 --> 41:30.990
you were always the strong one
looking out for me, and...

41:31.032 --> 41:34.411
I'm so sorry
for seeing past that.

41:38.957 --> 41:42.377
Can you ever forgive me?

41:42.419 --> 41:44.713
- Yes, of course.
You're my sister.

41:44.754 --> 41:46.589
[small laugh]

41:47.340 --> 41:51.386
Besides, I can't pin
all my disappointments on you.

41:51.428 --> 41:54.222
I made my choices,
and one of them was Lou.

41:55.682 --> 41:57.434
I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you.

41:57.475 --> 42:02.105
I'm sorry that I held it
against you all these years.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.359
You were right about him.

42:07.736 --> 42:11.281
- Believe me, I wish I wasn't.
- Me too.

42:13.199 --> 42:18.621
But he did give me a gift that
I will always be thankful for.

42:20.123 --> 42:23.710
- Will.
- He is something special.

42:23.752 --> 42:28.506
- Yeah.
He's a fine young man.

42:28.548 --> 42:30.425
And that is why I've decided

42:30.467 --> 42:33.219
not to do anything
to tamper with that.

42:35.513 --> 42:39.142
- So we're gonna wait
to tell him about Lou...

42:39.184 --> 42:42.145
- Yeah.
Maybe down the road.

42:46.900 --> 42:51.029
- I love you, Viv.

42:51.071 --> 42:55.033
- I know.
- [chuckling]

42:55.075 --> 42:57.369
- Girl, I love you too.
Come on.

42:57.410 --> 43:04.542
* *

43:10.340 --> 43:13.218
- Look, after seeing
our moms today,

43:13.259 --> 43:15.512
I can honestly say
I have no intention

43:15.553 --> 43:17.972
of having a decades-long grudge
with you, Will.

43:18.014 --> 43:19.474
- Me either.

43:19.516 --> 43:20.975
But I don't know
how we can move forward

43:21.017 --> 43:24.354
if you can't accept the fact
that I'm with Lisa now.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.189
- All right.

43:26.231 --> 43:28.358
This isn't just
about Lisa, all right?

43:28.400 --> 43:30.485
You coming here sent me
into a spiral.

43:30.527 --> 43:32.278
I was already having
a rough time at school

43:32.320 --> 43:33.780
getting good grades

43:33.822 --> 43:35.865
and leading my lacrosse team
to state championships.

43:35.907 --> 43:38.493
And my parents need me to be
basically fucking perfect,

43:38.535 --> 43:39.911
all right?
It's exhausting.

43:41.913 --> 43:44.582
And you just show up
and hook up with my ex.

43:45.917 --> 43:47.419
- So me being with Lisa

43:47.460 --> 43:49.129
is the straw
that broke the camel's back?

43:49.170 --> 43:50.880
- Exactly.

43:50.922 --> 43:53.967
You just strolled up in here,
and my parents loved you.

43:54.009 --> 43:56.011
The girls at school pretty much
couldn't get enough of you.

43:56.052 --> 43:59.180
And it's like, everything that
I had to work really hard for,

43:59.222 --> 44:01.725
you just had
without even trying.

44:02.475 --> 44:04.185
- I hear you.

44:04.227 --> 44:06.271
So basically,
what you're saying is,

44:06.312 --> 44:08.106
you're a hater?

44:08.148 --> 44:10.900
Yo, yo, I'm playing.
I am joking.

44:10.942 --> 44:14.237
And I feel you.
I get you, sort of.

44:14.279 --> 44:16.489
But I guess, I mean,
my only question is,

44:16.531 --> 44:18.116
moving forward,

44:18.158 --> 44:20.410
do you still have a problem
with me being with Lisa?

44:20.452 --> 44:22.120
'Cause I can't be looking
over my shoulder

44:22.162 --> 44:25.206
every five seconds, bro.

44:25.248 --> 44:28.668
- I mean, look, um...

44:28.710 --> 44:31.963
[sighs]

44:32.005 --> 44:35.759
honestly, it hurts,
but me and Lisa are over.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.720
We have been for a while,
and...

44:38.762 --> 44:42.682
and who she dates next
is none of my business.

44:42.724 --> 44:45.560
Just promise me
you won't hurt her, okay?

44:45.602 --> 44:47.604
She got enough of that from me.

44:48.521 --> 44:49.939
- You have my word.

44:49.981 --> 44:52.942
[soft music]

44:52.984 --> 44:59.949
* *

45:01.868 --> 45:03.953
For real.

45:17.384 --> 45:21.262
[edgy music]

45:21.304 --> 45:28.395
* *

45:29.396 --> 45:31.398
- Yo, G.

45:34.025 --> 45:35.193
I need you to do me a favor.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.778
A huge one.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.572
- [laughs]
Them ones, yeah?

45:39.614 --> 45:41.908
All right. How huge?

45:44.577 --> 45:46.830
- You think you could
look into my pops?

45:46.871 --> 45:48.748
- Huh.

45:48.790 --> 45:51.126
You're right.
That is a huge ask.

45:51.167 --> 45:52.460
- I know. I know.

45:52.502 --> 45:55.171
But I'm just trying
to figure out

45:55.213 --> 45:57.298
where he went after he left me.

45:57.340 --> 46:00.301
You know why, where he's at.

46:00.343 --> 46:03.346
I don't know.
Something, man.

46:04.014 --> 46:07.684
- Look, I'm not sure there are
satisfactory answers

46:07.726 --> 46:10.395
to the questions
concerning why, you know?

46:10.437 --> 46:14.107
People's motives
are difficult to pin down.

46:14.149 --> 46:16.401
[Ebony Tusks "Schuyler"]

46:16.443 --> 46:19.487
But as to where
your father is now...

46:19.529 --> 46:20.822
* *

46:20.864 --> 46:23.575
- * Rebel yet appointed *

46:23.616 --> 46:25.243
- I'll do what I can
to find out for you.

46:25.285 --> 46:27.912
- * What's your name
and where you from *

46:27.954 --> 46:29.497
* And where you headed
half a block from home *

46:29.539 --> 46:33.668
- Hey, man.
Thank you, G.

46:33.710 --> 46:36.796
- Don't thank me yet.
Wait to see if I deliver first.

46:36.838 --> 46:38.840
- Yeah, man. I know you will.

46:38.882 --> 46:40.425
007.

46:40.467 --> 46:42.260
- * Ample reinforcements *

46:42.302 --> 46:44.637
* Attributes you
never knew applied to you *

46:44.679 --> 46:46.348
* Until you fit a portrait *

46:46.389 --> 46:48.850
* Vague enough for you
to fade away behind a badge *

46:48.892 --> 46:52.020
* And brittle motive,
rebel put on notice *

46:52.062 --> 46:55.023
* Hands up in the air
as if you ever doubted *

46:55.065 --> 46:59.819
* Not another word, we got you
and your man surrounded *

46:59.861 --> 47:03.031
* This is what it is
and you can never stop us *

47:03.073 --> 47:05.533
* Catch us riding circles
'round your hood *

47:05.575 --> 47:07.327
* I'm 'bout to tear
your block up *

47:07.369 --> 47:10.955
* Block up, block up,
show me where the cash is at *

47:10.997 --> 47:13.375
* Hey, 'cause once
you disappear *

47:13.416 --> 47:15.752
* Ain't no comin' back *

47:15.794 --> 47:17.295
* That's just the way it is *

47:17.337 --> 47:19.756
* And you can never
stop us, catch us *

47:19.798 --> 47:21.257
* Ridin' circles
round your hood *

47:21.299 --> 47:23.009
* I'ma 'bout to tear
your block up *

47:23.051 --> 47:24.719
* This leper colony
is bogus *

47:24.761 --> 47:26.179
* Little boys
that never grow up *

47:26.221 --> 47:27.597
* Disembodied
from the floor up *

47:27.639 --> 47:29.182
* Sneaker game
a bit atrocious *

47:29.224 --> 47:30.642
* Pants that sag
a little lower *

47:30.684 --> 47:32.060
* Honor roll
at every quarter *

47:32.102 --> 47:33.645
* A pickup game
to hit a floater *

47:33.687 --> 47:35.063
* Your mother call you in
for supper *

47:35.105 --> 47:36.690
* Gobble up a double portion *

47:36.731 --> 47:38.066
* Eat enough
to feed an army *

47:38.108 --> 47:39.859
* But lil' man
is not a soldier *

47:39.901 --> 47:41.152
* Mix the sodium
and the sulfur *

47:41.194 --> 47:42.696
* You're Marie Curie
with the soda *

47:42.737 --> 47:44.072
* Got night employment
in the summer *

47:44.114 --> 47:45.615
* You save enough to cop
a suit and tie *

47:45.657 --> 47:46.908
* For winter formal *

47:46.950 --> 47:48.284
* Scoop a date up,

47:59.671 --> 48:01.673
* Hey,
life is but a dream *

48:01.715 --> 48:03.967
* For those
who never counted *
