WEBVTT

00:00.051 --> 00:01.780
Can I just say that
you're choosing to date

00:01.810 --> 00:02.598
a football player?

00:02.608 --> 00:04.582
He doesn't buy
into the whole jock thing.

00:04.746 --> 00:05.933
People change.

00:05.934 --> 00:07.447
Especially when they're
on the team.

00:08.183 --> 00:09.922
Look, it's just some
pick-me-ups I've been taking.

00:10.169 --> 00:11.406
What are you doing
to my son?

00:11.407 --> 00:12.757
I don't know
what's going on here.

00:12.758 --> 00:13.616
This!

00:13.616 --> 00:16.070
Smash is not gonna be
playing the game Friday night.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.589
What?

00:17.700 --> 00:18.510
Am I off the team?

00:18.514 --> 00:20.188
I should have reported this.

00:20.189 --> 00:21.771
You're gonna get yourself clean.

00:21.907 --> 00:23.461
Dad's down
in Corpus Christi.

00:23.468 --> 00:24.720
He's working on a driving range.

00:24.747 --> 00:26.130
Couple of postcards
every year

00:26.138 --> 00:27.610
and he gets off scot-free!

00:27.617 --> 00:29.002
I'm the one paying the bills
around here,

00:29.018 --> 00:30.951
going out there and watching
your damn football games.

00:30.956 --> 00:31.732
What's this?

00:31.736 --> 00:32.792
You've been served.

00:32.945 --> 00:33.691
Served by who?

00:33.738 --> 00:35.031
Jason Street's family.

00:35.488 --> 00:37.182
It's killing me to have
to do this to coach.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.912
The lawyers, my parents,
maybe they're right.

00:38.918 --> 00:41.210
Maybe if somebody teaches me
how to tackle somebody,

00:41.218 --> 00:42.272
I'm not in a chair.

00:42.318 --> 00:44.250
Why'd you set Lyla up
on a date with Ty Johnston?

00:44.348 --> 00:45.842
I don't want Lyla to be

00:45.848 --> 00:47.920
a caregiver her whole life, son.

00:47.938 --> 00:49.480
These Buddy Garritys of this world,

00:49.496 --> 00:51.143
they're a cancer to you and me.

00:51.147 --> 00:52.160
Lyla Garrity...

00:53.168 --> 00:54.370
will you marry me?

00:57.998 --> 00:59.133
So

00:59.155 --> 01:00.882
there's two cones
on either side of the goal.

01:00.915 --> 01:02.391
There's two goals, one
on either side of the court.

01:02.865 --> 01:04.052
You play on a basketball court.

01:04.328 --> 01:06.513
And the goal is
to get this ball--

01:06.566 --> 01:07.651
Y'all, watch those windows.

01:07.677 --> 01:08.970
And you wheel yourself through
the finish--

01:09.006 --> 01:09.630
That's okay.

01:09.708 --> 01:11.621
You wheel yourself through the goal line
and that's how you score.

01:12.807 --> 01:13.962
The position I really wanted

01:13.967 --> 01:16.190
- is called the "picker."
- It's like the quarterback, right?

01:16.248 --> 01:17.133
Right, right.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.553
He kinda controls the flow
of the game

01:18.587 --> 01:20.661
and he leads the breaks
and everything.

01:21.026 --> 01:22.130
You gotta be really fast.

01:22.157 --> 01:23.560
It's a really, really
hard position but

01:23.678 --> 01:25.263
I think-- I think
I'm good enough for it.

01:25.438 --> 01:27.993
So is this what I see them
playing at the YMCA sometimes?

01:28.036 --> 01:30.760
Oh, no, ma'am,
that's wheelchair basketball.

01:31.468 --> 01:32.800
Oh.There's a huge difference.

01:32.815 --> 01:34.363
Oh, yeah. Huge.

01:36.466 --> 01:38.442
Well, there is
a big difference, Mr. Garrity.

01:38.668 --> 01:40.642
The guys who play quad rugby,
they're world-class athletes.

01:40.706 --> 01:42.373
Three of them won medals last
year at the world championship.

01:42.376 --> 01:43.613
- Did they?
- Yeah.

01:44.007 --> 01:46.461
I know, it's great.
It's a great hobby.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.513
Come on, Dad, it's not a hobby.

01:48.577 --> 01:50.013
You can't make a living from it,
honey, so

01:50.097 --> 01:51.183
it must be a hobby.

01:53.107 --> 01:54.950
You guys, let's come on in
and eat, all right?

01:57.476 --> 01:58.672
You know what, Mr. Garrity?

01:58.728 --> 02:00.592
What exactly do you have
against quad rugby again?

02:00.657 --> 02:01.433
Nothing.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.771
Yes, you do 'cause
every time I come over here,

02:02.816 --> 02:04.280
- you're always making fun of it.
-Sweetie.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.593
All  I'm saying is it's not
a way to make a living.

02:07.645 --> 02:09.410
So what are you
gonna live off of, huh?

02:10.247 --> 02:12.390
- Lawsuit?
- Buddy, enough, okay?

02:12.436 --> 02:14.533
Oh, is that what this is about, Mr. Garrity?
You still pissed off about the lawsuits?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.811
- Yes, I am.
- What, are you a little kid?

02:15.815 --> 02:16.500
Get over it!

02:16.558 --> 02:18.033
Hey, let me tell
you something, son.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.421
You're suing my team.
You're suing my coach.

02:20.467 --> 02:22.561
- How do you expect me to feel?
- It's your team?

02:22.656 --> 02:24.302
How about a little compassion,
Mr. Garrity?

02:24.386 --> 02:26.063
I mean, I am paralyzed now.

02:26.075 --> 02:27.542
- Jason.
- All right, play the game.

02:27.635 --> 02:28.883
- Ply the gasme.
- I don't care. Play the game.

02:28.907 --> 02:30.193
I will play the game,
Mr. Garrity.

02:30.196 --> 02:31.130
- I will, I will.
- Do it.

02:31.135 --> 02:32.181
And when I make
the national team

02:32.198 --> 02:33.383
and I start touring
all over the world,

02:33.385 --> 02:34.421
I'll take your daughter
with me.

02:34.548 --> 02:35.560
How 'bout that?

02:35.727 --> 02:37.280
'Cause we're getting married.

02:38.686 --> 02:40.090
Excuse me?

02:41.106 --> 02:42.650
- That's right.
- Married?

02:42.765 --> 02:44.251
Yeah, we picked out a ring
this morning, didn't we?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.302
Okay.

02:54.076 --> 02:55.270
Daddy, please.

03:01.225 --> 03:02.441
What are you doing?

03:02.455 --> 03:03.830
What am I doing?
He's pushing me.

03:04.087 --> 03:05.121
- Jason.
- Hey.

03:05.367 --> 03:07.372
I'm not doing
anything wrong here, Lyla!

03:08.668 --> 03:09.443
Lyla!

Good evening, football fans!

03:57.896 --> 04:00.030
I'm Ralph Jarrett,
broadcasting live

04:00.037 --> 04:01.300
from Applebee's

04:01.345 --> 04:02.551
in Reiner Junction

04:02.575 --> 04:04.563
for a special playoff edition

04:04.625 --> 04:06.850
of Talkin' Panther Football.

04:09.647 --> 04:11.723
You know, the brackets
have been set

04:11.757 --> 04:15.081
and we know Dillon has drawn
the McNulty Mavericks

04:15.115 --> 04:16.221
in the first round.

04:16.675 --> 04:18.312
I'm going all the way
with him, baby.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.870
The big question all over town
is Smash Williams

04:21.606 --> 04:23.490
who got benched last week
and didn't play.

04:23.738 --> 04:26.071
Is he gonna be able
to play this Friday night?

04:26.168 --> 04:27.542
Let's get to the phone lines!

04:27.686 --> 04:29.472
So who had
the quesadilla burger?

04:29.528 --> 04:30.290
I did.

04:30.297 --> 04:31.981
Anyways, he got exactly
what he deserved.

04:31.988 --> 04:33.060
Shut up, man.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.270
I mean, do you even know
what happened?

04:34.276 --> 04:35.200
Are you a big shot now?

04:35.345 --> 04:37.651
Want to take us
to state by yourself?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.282
The point is, we won last week
without him.

04:39.808 --> 04:42.790
How did your meeting
with Mr. Connolly go?

04:43.006 --> 04:45.333
Um, it actually went
really good.

04:45.338 --> 04:46.652
- Yeah? 
- Um, well, I mean,

04:46.768 --> 04:48.610
what I really want is
I want my own column,

04:48.618 --> 04:51.652
you know, where I could
do reviews on movies and books

04:51.918 --> 04:53.091
and concerts.

04:53.095 --> 04:55.081
- That'd be cool.
- Julie Taylor's column on life.

04:55.415 --> 04:57.233
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a big treat.

04:57.275 --> 05:00.460
I understand starting quarterback
Matt Saracen is in the house.

05:00.485 --> 05:01.982
Maybe he'll come up
and join us.

05:01.985 --> 05:03.633
Come on, Matt!

05:09.516 --> 05:11.711
Sar-a-cen!
Sar-a-cen!

05:12.428 --> 05:14.542
You  really didn't have
to do this.

05:14.547 --> 05:16.183
- I could stay right here.
- No, go, go.

05:17.728 --> 05:19.813
Sar-a-cen!
Sar-a-cen!

05:23.805 --> 05:25.471
And then straight from the radio,

05:25.477 --> 05:27.320
Matt Saracen here.
Matt's sitting down here

05:27.323 --> 05:29.059
talking about football.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.480
I, uh--

05:32.874 --> 05:34.938
Look, I'm so sorry.
I didn't think--

05:35.069 --> 05:36.160
I mean, that guy can talk.

05:36.167 --> 05:37.921
Seriously.
He doesn't stop talking.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.942
No, it's cool.
You're the big star now, right?

05:40.946 --> 05:43.163
No, I'm not a big star.
I didn't know that--

05:43.166 --> 05:44.112
I'm sorry.

05:44.118 --> 05:45.532
I thought it would just be, like, hi,

05:45.546 --> 05:47.422
and then I came back,
and you were--

05:47.427 --> 05:49.691
Matt, they wouldn't even
let me pay for dinner.

05:50.846 --> 05:52.730
Tonight is
your night, my friend!

05:52.737 --> 05:54.653
Saracen.
You're coming with.

05:54.657 --> 05:55.402
No, I'm not.

05:55.405 --> 05:56.703
- Let's go!
- I'm with Julie right now.

05:59.307 --> 06:01.660
- Uh, no no no no--
- Seriously. Get in.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.790
- Wait, where are you taking him?
- Duty calls!

06:03.797 --> 06:04.720
Keep him in there.

06:04.727 --> 06:06.100
- Uh--
- I'm-I'm sorry, but--

06:06.108 --> 06:07.532
You can't just leave me here.

06:07.536 --> 06:08.752
Sorry, it's a football thing.

06:08.757 --> 06:10.131
- Yeah, but I need a ride home.
- Let's go!

06:11.735 --> 06:13.740
They're making me do this.
I don't wanna--

06:15.116 --> 06:16.821
Let's go!

06:17.898 --> 06:19.723
- Whoo!
- Football.

06:20.097 --> 06:22.410
You know, he's not coming back,
if that's what you're thinking.

06:24.847 --> 06:25.903
Want a ride?

06:27.206 --> 06:28.671
Uh, no thank you.

06:28.786 --> 06:30.952
Um,
I'll just call my mom.

06:31.138 --> 06:32.262
Okay.

06:36.018 --> 06:37.350
Wait!

06:39.216 --> 06:40.711
Are you sure you don't mind?

06:41.037 --> 06:41.670
Yeah.

06:41.887 --> 06:42.821
It's no problem.

06:43.857 --> 06:45.260
I just gotta
pick my sister up first.

06:45.385 --> 06:46.583
Okay, well, where's she at?

06:47.195 --> 06:47.981
Working.

06:48.977 --> 06:49.801
Strip club.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.401
Two ways to fold a towel:

07:11.407 --> 07:13.081
my way and the wrong way.
Let's do it right.

07:17.197 --> 07:18.523
Yes, sir.

07:24.587 --> 07:25.853
Game plan for Friday.

07:25.856 --> 07:26.941
I want ten of 'em.

07:26.997 --> 07:29.340
Binders and notebooks
over by the copier.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.580
Right now?

07:33.508 --> 07:34.502
Well, gee, yeah, Smash,

07:34.516 --> 07:35.972
if it wouldn't be too much
of an inconvenience,

07:35.975 --> 07:37.253
I'd appreciate it. 

07:37.977 --> 07:39.102
Hey, let me tell you something.

07:39.105 --> 07:40.620
You think I'd rather be
here right now

07:40.625 --> 07:41.851
with you at the crack of dawn

07:41.855 --> 07:43.651
than be home with my family
cooking breakfast?

07:43.658 --> 07:44.391
- Coach, I'm sorry.
- Huh?

07:44.397 --> 07:45.950
- I'm sorry.
- You thinkin' about that?

07:46.266 --> 07:48.011
Did you bring those test
results from the clinic?

07:48.327 --> 07:49.740
- Yes, sir.
- Lemme see 'em.

07:54.138 --> 07:55.573
-  Coach, I didn't mean--
- You didn't mean what?

07:56.067 --> 07:57.873
You didn't mean to risk my
reputation and my career?

07:57.875 --> 07:58.901
Is that what
you were gonna say?

07:59.176 --> 08:01.201
I got the chairman of the
district executive committee.

08:01.308 --> 08:02.011
You know what he's doing?

08:02.078 --> 08:03.833
He's calling me at home.

08:04.616 --> 08:05.872
So you're not the only one

08:05.878 --> 08:08.133
with your ass
on the line, Smash.

08:10.157 --> 08:10.881
Yes, sir.

08:12.177 --> 08:13.932
That's good!
Congratulations.

08:20.846 --> 08:22.840
Sir, I still don't see
what the big deal is.

08:22.847 --> 08:24.522
Why can't I just pay
the ticket and go?

08:24.537 --> 08:26.691
Well, the problem's not so much
the speeding ticket.

08:26.695 --> 08:28.533
It's your failure to appear.

08:28.745 --> 08:29.752
Yes, sir.

08:29.928 --> 08:31.611
You see,
I had an away game that day,

08:31.615 --> 08:32.962
so I completely forgot--

08:32.966 --> 08:34.210
Look, how about this:

08:34.256 --> 08:35.960
you pay the fine,
you promise me you're not gonna

08:35.967 --> 08:37.832
speed out there,
and I'll drop the charges.

08:37.927 --> 08:39.722
If it's okay
with your folks.

08:40.534 --> 08:43.481
Is it okay
if my brother signs for me?

08:43.528 --> 08:45.162
Is he your legal guardian?

08:46.346 --> 08:47.460
- Billy!
- What?

08:47.545 --> 08:48.990
Are you his legal guardian?

08:49.036 --> 08:50.950
Uh, no, technically
I'm not, but--

08:50.997 --> 08:53.020
Look, you're a minor.
It has to be a parent

08:53.026 --> 08:54.161
or a legal guardian.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.121
Otherwise, I have
to take your license.

08:56.237 --> 08:57.373
This is no joke, son.

08:57.416 --> 08:58.570
Just get that signed.

08:59.418 --> 09:00.380
All right, Your Honor.

09:00.385 --> 09:02.151
Um, I'll just get my father
to sign it.

09:02.157 --> 09:03.621
Just get it signed
and bring it back.

09:04.308 --> 09:06.001
So last night
was the first time

09:06.005 --> 09:07.572
I've ever stepped foot
in a strip club.

09:07.866 --> 09:09.031
You don't say.

09:10.965 --> 09:13.230
I know we were there
for, like, five minutes, but

09:14.056 --> 09:16.151
does your sister ever get,
like, freaked out?

09:16.155 --> 09:17.941
I mean, some of those guys
were completely creepy.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.101
Yeah, well,

09:19.106 --> 09:20.093
she's a big girl.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.343
Plus, those guys
are pretty harmless.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.691
Sad and pathetic,

09:23.695 --> 09:24.672
but harmless.

09:27.147 --> 09:28.723
Guess who her
biggest customer is?

09:29.198 --> 09:30.273
Who?

09:31.625 --> 09:32.791
Buddy Garrity.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.761
Gross!

09:37.946 --> 09:38.562
Okay.

09:40.728 --> 09:42.121
No, it's up there.

09:44.277 --> 09:45.483
That color
looks good on you.

09:46.327 --> 09:47.200
You  should get it.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.200
I don't know.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.003
I don't really
have the money for it.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.102
What are you doing?

10:07.245 --> 10:09.910
Tim, just let me sign
the stupid paper, man.

10:09.978 --> 10:11.140
No, Billy.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.342
I can't risk it.
It's my license.

10:14.438 --> 10:15.383
What is this?

10:15.386 --> 10:17.312
Some sort of work out my stuff
with dad thing?

10:17.777 --> 10:19.380
What are you talking about?

10:19.477 --> 10:20.573
Hey, Tim.

10:22.058 --> 10:24.112
We haven't even seen
the guy in two years, man.

10:24.235 --> 10:25.712
We don't even know
if he still lives here.

10:26.467 --> 10:28.221
I'm sure
it'll be fine, Billy.

10:29.456 --> 10:30.903
All right, I'm good.

10:31.147 --> 10:31.831
Hey.

10:31.967 --> 10:32.860
Come here.

10:33.665 --> 10:35.673
Do not believe a word that
that man says, okay?

10:35.825 --> 10:37.381
Because he is a total liar.

10:38.116 --> 10:39.342
And do not get drunk
with him

10:39.345 --> 10:41.350
because he is a mean son
of a bitch when he's loaded.

10:42.215 --> 10:44.332
Billy, it's a signature.

10:44.708 --> 10:45.783
That's all I'm gettin'.

10:47.615 --> 10:49.323
All right.All right.
You got money?

10:49.546 --> 10:50.473
Yeah, I got money.

10:50.477 --> 10:51.793
Here. Uh, take that.

10:53.747 --> 10:55.201
Whatever you do, do not,

10:55.686 --> 10:57.241
under any circumstances,

10:57.246 --> 10:58.542
give that money to him.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.432
I understand, Billy.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.831
All right.

11:02.025 --> 11:03.462
All right. Thank you.

11:07.057 --> 11:07.850
Hey!

11:08.557 --> 11:09.771
See ya soon!

11:10.797 --> 11:11.661
Yeah.

11:17.237 --> 11:20.812
No, you are not going
to a concert on a weeknight.

11:20.855 --> 11:22.182
But it's not just any concert.

11:22.186 --> 11:24.030
I mean, it's the Old 97s
and they're awesome.

11:24.068 --> 11:26.800
Well, if they're so awesome,
why don't they get a gig on a weekend?

11:26.915 --> 11:28.020
What do I have
to do to make this work?

11:28.026 --> 11:29.651
I will get on the floor
and start groveling.

11:29.758 --> 11:31.092
Honey,
what about your homework?

11:31.197 --> 11:32.662
I'll get it done...

11:32.828 --> 11:34.663
before I leave
and you can check it

11:34.707 --> 11:36.403
and I'll stay in
on Saturday.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.833
And you and me and dad,

11:37.838 --> 11:39.240
we can have, like,
a family night.

11:39.248 --> 11:40.650
Oh, honey, don't grovel.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.960
It's not becoming.

11:44.047 --> 11:44.883
Please?

11:47.826 --> 11:48.680
All right.

11:48.685 --> 11:49.921
You have to be in by 11:00,

11:49.937 --> 11:51.312
not one second later.

11:51.365 --> 11:51.862
Yes, ma'am.

11:51.868 --> 11:54.010
And don't tell your father.
Let me break it to your father.

11:54.028 --> 11:54.901
All you!

11:54.928 --> 11:56.003
Hey, where's your coat?

11:56.015 --> 11:57.133
Put your coat on!

11:57.478 --> 11:58.750
Hurry up.

11:59.388 --> 12:01.830
And make sure the door locks
when you close it!

12:02.926 --> 12:04.140
Hurry up!

12:28.657 --> 12:31.841
Throwed his sorry ass out
six months ago, Sugar.

12:32.575 --> 12:34.303
Well, do you know
where I can find him, ma'am?

12:34.486 --> 12:37.180
Well, he used to hustle golf
down at Jackson Crest.

12:37.335 --> 12:40.691
It's a little piece of crap muni
somewhere out in the boonies.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.331
All right.
I'll try him there.

12:43.866 --> 12:45.152
- Thank you.
- You bet.

12:48.277 --> 12:50.892
Hey, if you see him,
I want you to do something for me.

12:51.277 --> 12:52.800
I want you to tell him

12:52.935 --> 12:55.300
that I want my
Conway Twitty back.

12:55.926 --> 12:58.372
They don't have him
at Target no more.

12:59.086 --> 13:00.300
All right!

13:01.058 --> 13:02.132
Knock her close, buddy.

13:03.268 --> 13:04.683
No, knock her close.

13:06.226 --> 13:08.343
Nice shot, that'll save you
a couple bucks.

13:09.137 --> 13:11.191
Oh, well.
It's just money, right?

13:11.198 --> 13:12.221
The bill is 60.

13:13.018 --> 13:14.021
Thanks, gentlemen.
Enjoy your money.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.340
Oh, I will.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.593
Hit that driving range.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.271
Good God in heaven.

13:27.526 --> 13:28.320
Timmy?

13:33.298 --> 13:34.280
Well come on!

13:34.715 --> 13:36.503
Give your old man a hug!

13:38.675 --> 13:39.581
Come here, boy.

13:45.155 --> 13:46.642
I guess I'm in no position

13:46.656 --> 13:48.770
to be offering up
any fatherly advice.

13:49.166 --> 13:50.030
You know, given--

13:50.796 --> 13:52.413
given the circumstances. 

13:54.728 --> 13:56.072
You just want me
to sign right here?

13:56.825 --> 13:57.552
Yeah.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.090
Thanks.

14:02.316 --> 14:02.892
All right.

14:04.696 --> 14:05.453
Thanks.

14:06.297 --> 14:07.253
So how you doing?

14:07.757 --> 14:08.750
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

14:08.757 --> 14:09.710
-  Really?
- Yeah.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.183
How about you?

14:11.508 --> 14:12.522
Well, I'm good.

14:13.595 --> 14:14.593
Real good.

14:16.896 --> 14:18.683
Yeah, I'm on--I'm on
the wagon now.

14:18.706 --> 14:20.490
You know, I've been sober, uh,

14:20.516 --> 14:22.013
six weeks next Tuesday.

14:22.285 --> 14:22.951
Nice.

14:23.108 --> 14:25.282
Otherwise, I'd be buying
you a beer.

14:26.478 --> 14:27.481
Well, that's all right.

14:27.486 --> 14:29.641
I gotta drive anyways, so--

14:29.646 --> 14:31.070
Oh. Well--

14:37.958 --> 14:38.761
Yeah.

14:39.535 --> 14:41.461
- Anyways, I sh--
- Can you hang out for a while?

14:44.447 --> 14:45.311
Yeah.

14:47.857 --> 14:48.880
Yeah, I could--

14:48.886 --> 14:50.261
I could stay for a bit.

14:50.305 --> 14:53.002
Well, I got $200 burning
a hole in my pocket

14:53.007 --> 14:55.211
from Manny, Moe, and Jack out there.
Are you hungry at all?

14:55.986 --> 14:56.902
I could eat.

14:57.176 --> 14:57.843
Good.

14:58.758 --> 15:00.231
Okay, okay.

15:01.448 --> 15:02.410
I'm sorry.

15:04.115 --> 15:05.322
I didn't want it
to happen like that.

15:05.325 --> 15:06.173
- I really didn't.
- It's okay.

15:06.178 --> 15:06.792
I swear.

15:06.795 --> 15:08.853
I know.
It's kinda my fault too.

15:09.365 --> 15:11.403
I don't know why I felt like
I had to hide it from them.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.583
I know you're gonna think this is

15:17.866 --> 15:20.261
a total girl thing, and I'm crazy, but---

15:21.487 --> 15:23.462
but I just--
I've always had this vision,

15:23.788 --> 15:25.523
you know, of my wedding,

15:25.576 --> 15:27.753
and I'd be 25.

15:28.358 --> 15:30.281
There'd be this huge reception

15:30.307 --> 15:31.552
and dancing and toasts.

15:31.558 --> 15:33.482
You don't know if you can do
all that with me now.

15:34.046 --> 15:35.250
No, Jason.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.383
If you're gonna be honest,
just--

15:36.385 --> 15:38.273
No, that has nothing to do with

15:38.906 --> 15:40.823
it being you. It's just

15:41.178 --> 15:43.263
I haven't even
applied to a college yet.

15:43.605 --> 15:45.712
And you haven't even said
whether or not you're--

15:45.715 --> 15:47.252
Oh, you think I'm not going
to college now?

15:47.338 --> 15:48.350
I don't know.

15:49.956 --> 15:51.543
I mean, I assume you are,

15:51.575 --> 15:52.873
but all you talk about is--

15:52.917 --> 15:55.051
Lyla, I lost my legs, not my brain.

15:55.506 --> 15:56.990
Okay, I'm gonna go to school.

15:57.177 --> 15:58.423
And I'm gonna get a job.

15:58.447 --> 16:00.500
And we'll have friends.
We'll have a big house

16:00.525 --> 16:02.122
and a picket fence
and a couple of puppies

16:02.126 --> 16:03.720
and that whole thing
you dream about.

16:03.728 --> 16:04.412
No, Jason!

16:04.415 --> 16:05.531
Getting married's
not gonna change that.

16:05.537 --> 16:07.121
I have a life too.

16:07.677 --> 16:08.540
- I know.
- No,

16:08.546 --> 16:11.163
sometimes I don't think
you care about that anymore.

16:11.266 --> 16:12.373
Or you think it's lame.

16:12.378 --> 16:13.922
And it scares me, Jason.

16:14.027 --> 16:15.243
- No, that's not it at all.
- I just think that

16:15.246 --> 16:17.313
we're too young right now
and we're rushing into this.

16:17.317 --> 16:18.912
And I don't want to make a mistake.

16:23.296 --> 16:24.492
Message received, Lyla.

16:24.607 --> 16:25.641
Loud and clear.

16:33.097 --> 16:34.580
Can you please
get my chair for me?

16:35.448 --> 16:36.201
Yeah.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.131
Blue, 20, hut!

16:42.157 --> 16:43.582
You gotta get
up on him, Smash!

16:43.627 --> 16:45.773
Get out of the sack!
Come on, Smash! Pick it up!

16:46.386 --> 16:47.812
What the hell
are you walking for?

16:48.498 --> 16:49.341
God.

16:49.496 --> 16:50.090
Dang.

16:50.146 --> 16:51.142
- Coach--
- Let's go.

16:52.635 --> 16:54.530
Not as much fun when
you're blocking, is it, huh?

16:54.696 --> 16:55.982
Just doing my job, man.

16:55.998 --> 16:56.841
Just doing my job.

16:56.847 --> 16:58.452
Smash, you better get
your head out front!

16:58.458 --> 16:59.871
- You gotta drive his ass!
- Yes, sir.

16:59.877 --> 17:02.212
Well, I can see teaching him
a lesson, coach, but--

17:02.217 --> 17:03.092
Let's go!

17:03.097 --> 17:05.053
It's not gonna do us much good
Friday night if he's hurt.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.030
Who said he was gonna play
Friday night? Let's go!

17:07.435 --> 17:09.012
Come on, Eric,
you gotta be kidding me.

17:09.036 --> 17:11.462
Baxter can't hold
Smash's jock.

17:13.026 --> 17:13.921
Let's go!

17:14.006 --> 17:15.502
- Hey, you're the coach.
- Run the ball!

17:15.508 --> 17:16.432
It's your team.

17:16.707 --> 17:18.021
God, I'm tired of this!

17:18.518 --> 17:19.811
But you know tomorrow night
will be good.

17:19.815 --> 17:20.781
That's gonna be
a lot of fun.

17:20.785 --> 17:21.452
You know what, Buddy,

17:21.458 --> 17:22.990
I'm trying to win
a play-off game here.

17:22.996 --> 17:24.960
I don't have time
to talk about a damn TV show.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.230
It's tradition.

17:26.406 --> 17:28.320
It's simple.
All you gotta do is go up there

17:28.338 --> 17:30.692
and smile pretty, talk about
football for half an hour.

17:30.886 --> 17:32.272
It'll be easy.
You'll love it.

17:32.608 --> 17:33.632
It's all about football.

17:33.715 --> 17:35.331
Let's go!
Hustle up now!

17:36.438 --> 17:38.060
- Attaboy!
- How's he gonna get outside--

17:38.117 --> 17:41.083
And besides, remember, you get a nice
little appearance fee for doing it.

17:43.615 --> 17:45.491
Wait a sec!
Hold up, hold up!

17:45.908 --> 17:48.781
Look, I'm really sorry.
I know you wanted to go to the concert

17:48.846 --> 17:51.452
Yeah, that's kinda the point,
saying you invited me.

17:51.526 --> 17:53.492
- Right--
- But, you know, no biggie.

17:53.558 --> 17:56.453
I just pretty much sold my soul
to my mother for permission.

17:56.458 --> 17:57.311
It's just, you know,

17:57.316 --> 17:58.841
your dad asked me,

17:58.917 --> 18:01.381
and well, I've never been
on TV before.

18:04.797 --> 18:07.573
Okay, so if my dad
wasn't involved,

18:09.035 --> 18:10.141
are you excited?

18:10.996 --> 18:12.041
Yeah, a little bit.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.111
Then you should go.

18:13.317 --> 18:14.352
- You rea--
- But!

18:14.498 --> 18:15.632
You have to remember
this moment

18:15.637 --> 18:17.771
when I officially became
the coolest

18:18.245 --> 18:20.302
and most understanding girl
in the world.

18:20.435 --> 18:22.530
Okay, I will.
I'll keep that in mind.

18:23.828 --> 18:24.572
Are you mad?

18:24.617 --> 18:26.150
A little,
but I'll get over it.

18:26.207 --> 18:27.120
Good...

18:27.216 --> 18:28.503
because

18:28.838 --> 18:32.183
I also need you to watch
my grandma while I do it?

18:34.627 --> 18:35.412
Please?

18:36.968 --> 18:38.010
Sure. Why not?

18:38.027 --> 18:41.292
See, you are the coolest, most
understanding girlfriend in the world.

18:41.876 --> 18:42.782
Girlfriend?

18:42.877 --> 18:44.223
All right, girl.

18:44.225 --> 18:45.393
'Cause I'm hoping--

18:45.397 --> 18:46.612
- Please?
- No.

18:46.615 --> 18:48.331
- Do not "no"--
- No!

18:49.477 --> 18:52.130
Yeah, baby, that's
what I'm talking about!

18:52.138 --> 18:53.820
- Fish in a barrel!
- Nice shot.

18:53.825 --> 18:55.011
Not too shabby.

18:55.595 --> 18:56.533
Hey, here she is.

18:56.578 --> 18:57.532
Hanna Banana.

18:57.558 --> 18:59.220
- Come here.
- Oh, hey, Walt.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.530
This is my boy Tim.

19:01.756 --> 19:03.272
Take care of him.
Whatever he wants.

19:03.287 --> 19:04.393
All right,
I'll be back in a minute.

19:04.395 --> 19:05.910
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.983
Oh, my God,

19:08.076 --> 19:10.222
so you're the son, huh?

19:10.228 --> 19:11.581
Nice to meet you.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.313
You know, he talks
about you all the time.

19:15.477 --> 19:16.313
Really?

19:16.318 --> 19:17.133
Oh, yeah.

19:17.137 --> 19:19.803
Every Saturday when he comes
in here for league,

19:20.177 --> 19:21.630
we get the whole update,

19:21.698 --> 19:22.783
who you played

19:22.807 --> 19:23.861
the score,

19:23.865 --> 19:25.552
how many touchdowns you made.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.761
Oh, he is so proud.

19:27.975 --> 19:29.072
And congratulations

19:29.078 --> 19:30.681
for making it
to the playoffs by the way.

19:30.686 --> 19:32.061
- Check it out.
- Check it out.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.310
- Oh, baby!
- My God.

19:35.728 --> 19:36.921
A new ball.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.593
He's only waited
on that for a month.

19:39.858 --> 19:41.180
This is a weapon.

19:41.285 --> 19:42.983
You're in serious trouble,
my friend.

19:43.096 --> 19:44.373
Don't go hurting yourself.

19:44.607 --> 19:46.303
No, I won't.
Thank you.

19:46.307 --> 19:47.432
Okay, honey.

19:48.147 --> 19:49.100
Bye, sweetie.

19:49.148 --> 19:50.243
I'll see ya later.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.380
I appreciate it.

19:53.907 --> 19:54.803
Hey, uh,

19:54.808 --> 19:56.481
if we're still gonna grab
that bite to eat later,

19:56.487 --> 19:58.603
maybe it's best I stay
at your place tonight.

19:58.788 --> 19:59.711
What do you think?

20:00.995 --> 20:02.133
Yeah, man!

20:02.716 --> 20:03.601
Bring it on.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.902
I got a couch with your name
written all over it.

20:06.046 --> 20:06.832
All right.

20:16.116 --> 20:16.933
Hey!

20:21.277 --> 20:23.270
All right, this should be
the screen pass to Riggins

20:23.315 --> 20:24.712
when we finally score here.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.972
- It's the play after this.
- Hang on a second.

20:27.288 --> 20:29.173
No, Coach--
If you hit forward--

20:29.225 --> 20:30.831
Hang on a second.
I know what I'm doing.

20:31.005 --> 20:32.073
I smell Emmy.

20:32.158 --> 20:33.892
Yeah, well, I'm gonna have

20:34.168 --> 20:36.161
to renegotiate
that appearance fee.

20:38.075 --> 20:39.350
- If you just hit it once--
- Stop!

20:41.785 --> 20:43.320
Hey, there's something wrong
with the clicker.

20:44.445 --> 20:45.690
There's something wrong
with the clicker!

20:45.786 --> 20:47.080
- We'll--we'll work--
- Ow.

20:47.546 --> 20:48.070
Okay...

20:48.078 --> 20:50.091
Let's not do
the game film right now.

20:50.096 --> 20:51.832
Obviously we have a problem
with the clicker.

20:52.005 --> 20:53.321
Let's do the interview.

20:53.496 --> 20:54.913
Uh, Coach, just relax,

20:54.937 --> 20:56.220
and have a conversation.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.273
What would you like us
to have a conversation about?

20:59.138 --> 20:59.881
'Bout football.

21:00.087 --> 21:01.061
Oh, that's great.

21:01.198 --> 21:02.212
Okay, let's do that.

21:02.256 --> 21:03.381
Anything specific?

21:05.618 --> 21:08.550
Matt, why don't you ask him,
uh, some questions?

21:08.887 --> 21:09.992
Good? Yeah.

21:10.045 --> 21:10.990
That's a good idea.

21:10.995 --> 21:12.681
Okay. When you're ready.

21:12.726 --> 21:13.803
Well, okay, um...

21:13.848 --> 21:15.880
I think what
everyone wants to know

21:16.256 --> 21:17.303
is, um,

21:17.586 --> 21:19.600
is Smash gonna play on Friday?

21:21.678 --> 21:22.700
What the hell kind
of question is that?

21:22.705 --> 21:24.312
You're supposed to be helping
me out here, Saracen.

21:24.356 --> 21:25.560
- Well, I just thought--
- Don't be goofy.

21:25.566 --> 21:26.802
Just ask a normal question.

21:26.806 --> 21:27.863
Let's get this over with

21:27.865 --> 21:28.953
That's what
everybody's been asking.

21:28.957 --> 21:29.883
Ask him about the tight end.

21:30.925 --> 21:32.492
You find everything
in there, honey?

21:32.538 --> 21:33.200
Uh, yeah.

21:33.218 --> 21:34.401
Everything's good.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.680
Uh, here's your sandwich.

21:37.218 --> 21:38.531
Mm. Thank you.

21:38.985 --> 21:39.753
Good.

21:40.225 --> 21:41.422
I got it.

21:43.047 --> 21:44.360
Is it okay?

21:44.428 --> 21:46.401
Um...
I invited a friend over.

21:47.708 --> 21:48.821
I guess so.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.762
I like company all right.

21:51.427 --> 21:53.103
All right, that's
the end of it, huh?

21:53.516 --> 21:54.591
That's all the other.

21:56.326 --> 21:57.701
That's all
the other we got.

21:57.758 --> 21:59.292
I mean, that's one
of the reasons I swore

21:59.316 --> 22:00.640
I'd never date
a football player.

22:00.696 --> 22:02.622
Oh, honey, Matt's
not really a football player.

22:02.877 --> 22:03.861
No offense.

22:04.325 --> 22:05.461
Oh, that's all right.

22:06.885 --> 22:08.921
All right, but now that
he's acting like one

22:09.327 --> 22:10.510
here's what
you gotta do.

22:10.555 --> 22:12.692
Number one rule
in dating a Dillon Panther,

22:13.407 --> 22:14.920
always let him know
you have options.

22:16.167 --> 22:17.490
But I do have options.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.003
I'm gonna join
the school paper.

22:20.035 --> 22:22.092
I mean, like,
the basketball team.

22:22.286 --> 22:23.312
They hate that.

22:23.787 --> 22:25.641
But I don't know anybody
on the basketball team.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.761
Isn't that just kinda stupid?

22:26.766 --> 22:28.460
Okay, but see,
he doesn't have to know that.

22:29.027 --> 22:30.741
I'm telling you, he's gonna
have these rally girls

22:30.766 --> 22:32.493
fawning all over him
until Spring, okay?

22:32.507 --> 22:33.892
You gotta elevate your game.

22:35.635 --> 22:36.810
Look, Eric,

22:37.198 --> 22:39.451
I have always loved Jason
like my son.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.570
I still do.

22:40.867 --> 22:43.051
But this is my daughter
we're talking about.

22:43.165 --> 22:44.552
And the bottom line is

22:44.815 --> 22:46.032
Jason's a quadriplegic.

22:46.038 --> 22:47.830
Now, I know it's not PC
to say that,

22:47.836 --> 22:49.571
but I have to think
about my daughter.

22:49.697 --> 22:52.441
She's my responsibility.
I gotta think about her life.

22:52.448 --> 22:54.673
I'll tell you something.
Jason Street's a good kid.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.981
He's gonna succeed
no matter what he does.

22:57.277 --> 22:59.471
Just give him some time.
The last thing you wanna do

22:59.537 --> 23:00.521
is pressure them.

23:00.526 --> 23:02.242
That's gonna come around
and bite you in the ass

23:02.248 --> 23:03.091
- if you do that.
- Yeah.

23:03.096 --> 23:04.612
- They're smart kids. They'll deal with it.
- Yeah.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.182
I thought they were smart.

23:06.247 --> 23:08.223
I thought that till they tell me
they're getting married.

23:08.226 --> 23:09.152
They're just in high school.

23:09.156 --> 23:12.270
I mean, maybe someday in the
future if things work out.

23:12.328 --> 23:14.411
So please just talk to Jason.

23:14.467 --> 23:15.723
- I'll do that.
- He respects you.

23:15.967 --> 23:16.933
- Thanks.
- I'll do that.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.511
If someone would talk
to his parents,

23:18.547 --> 23:20.191
maybe I wouldn't be
getting sued right now.

23:20.216 --> 23:22.111
Yeah, I wish I could talk
to them for you. Hey!

23:22.545 --> 23:24.292
That was a great job in there.

23:27.176 --> 23:28.151
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

23:33.765 --> 23:35.080
Child, where you been?

23:35.368 --> 23:37.012
It's almost time for Leno!

23:38.666 --> 23:39.463
Boy!

23:40.717 --> 23:42.390
You been runnin'
this whole time?

23:42.617 --> 23:43.242
Mostly.

23:43.928 --> 23:45.191
I stopped once or twice.

23:45.308 --> 23:46.860
Oh, I think you need
to slow down.

23:47.237 --> 23:49.272
- Don't even worry about it.
- Oh, I do worry about it.

23:49.318 --> 23:50.551
That's my job.

23:51.096 --> 23:51.972
That's your job?

23:53.238 --> 23:54.752
Well, I'm doing
my job too, Mama.

23:55.328 --> 23:56.730
All right, I'm so tired

23:56.998 --> 23:58.342
I can barely finish my sets

23:58.397 --> 24:00.180
without feeling
like I'ma fall over and die.

24:00.197 --> 24:01.291
I know.
It's that poison.

24:02.138 --> 24:03.822
Your body just needs time
to adjust.

24:03.827 --> 24:05.062
Mama, I don't have any time!

24:05.836 --> 24:07.212
You know what it's like
over there?

24:07.355 --> 24:08.732
It's like blood in the water!

24:09.098 --> 24:10.772
I mean, I got Baxter trying

24:10.776 --> 24:11.710
to steal my job!

24:11.718 --> 24:13.722
And Coach watching me
like a hawk!

24:14.098 --> 24:16.540
So, no, no!
I'm not gonna slow down!

24:16.967 --> 24:18.082
At least not right now!

24:18.148 --> 24:19.811
I just worry about you.

24:19.986 --> 24:20.810
I know--

24:27.458 --> 24:29.303
All Jason wanted
to do was slalom.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.610
I bet I was in that boat
with him for three hours

24:33.117 --> 24:34.453
trying to get him up.

24:34.868 --> 24:36.161
Going round and round.
You remember?

24:36.166 --> 24:36.972
Yeah.

24:37.295 --> 24:38.563
I remember.

24:39.255 --> 24:40.820
He was pretty pissed that day.

24:44.518 --> 24:45.873
I don't think J's gonna be doing

24:45.878 --> 24:47.580
too much more skiing anymore
though.

24:47.976 --> 24:49.152
It's a damn shame.

24:49.617 --> 24:50.880
He's good people, that kid.

24:51.437 --> 24:52.073
Yep.

24:53.347 --> 24:54.362
How's Billy doing?

24:55.587 --> 24:56.803
Good.
He actually says

24:57.467 --> 24:58.480
to say hi.

25:00.158 --> 25:01.041
Did he really?

25:02.427 --> 25:04.011
No. Not at all really.

25:08.885 --> 25:10.711
You know, Billy's all right.

25:12.287 --> 25:14.481
I know he hates me.
I don't blame him.

25:15.806 --> 25:16.892
You were

25:19.156 --> 25:19.922
too young,

25:19.927 --> 25:21.052
but he saw some things
that...

25:22.438 --> 25:23.742
I'm not too proud of.

25:25.765 --> 25:27.771
Dad, I was ten.
I wasn't blind.

25:40.978 --> 25:42.240
Hey, did you
call your coach?

25:42.887 --> 25:43.873
Yeah, I did,

25:43.878 --> 25:46.282
and he's pretty rattled
for missing two practices.

25:46.447 --> 25:48.002
Yeah. I reckon.

25:51.035 --> 25:52.222
It's worth it though.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.193
So what do you think of Parcells?

26:00.236 --> 26:01.940
Stick around
for another year or what?

26:02.397 --> 26:03.983
Maybe get a ring.
Friggin' Cowboys?

26:03.986 --> 26:06.132
No, no friggin' Cowboys.
I'm gonna start rooting for the Saints.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.133
No kidding.

26:11.968 --> 26:14.061
Next on number one tee will be

26:14.067 --> 26:15.691
the Riggins twosome.

26:15.868 --> 26:16.683
Riggins.

26:16.998 --> 26:18.203
$5 Nassau.

26:18.415 --> 26:19.403
Automatic presses

26:19.408 --> 26:20.343
when you're down two.

26:20.767 --> 26:22.711
All right, well, that's not fair
'cause I got rentals.

26:22.717 --> 26:24.160
Which is why I'm giving you
six strokes.

26:24.168 --> 26:25.312
Now don't be a whiner.

26:25.905 --> 26:27.840
Well, let's up the ante then.

26:30.485 --> 26:31.403
I win,

26:31.576 --> 26:33.943
you come to Dillon
on Friday to watch me play.

26:34.158 --> 26:34.940
Deal?

26:36.078 --> 26:37.453
Uh-huh.
What if I win?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.012
If you win,

26:40.966 --> 26:42.232
which you won't...

26:45.037 --> 26:47.013
I won't tell that gal Lydia
where you live.

26:48.137 --> 26:49.022
That's a good one.

26:49.685 --> 26:50.650
It's pretty good.

26:50.768 --> 26:51.563
You're on.

26:51.636 --> 26:52.660
Let's see what you got.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.491
Long and wrong.

26:56.748 --> 26:57.813
Did you hit a car?

26:57.935 --> 26:58.721
Maybe.

27:00.605 --> 27:03.133
Nothing another swing can't
take care of, you know.

27:03.196 --> 27:05.292
No, no, this ain't the LPGA,
you weenie.

27:05.298 --> 27:06.431
There's no mulligans.

27:07.305 --> 27:08.481
Come on.

27:09.696 --> 27:10.663
All right.

27:11.985 --> 27:12.700
All right.

27:12.707 --> 27:13.360
Hut!

27:15.067 --> 27:16.061
Get there.
Get there.

27:17.397 --> 27:18.793
Man, these guys
are flat today.

27:19.488 --> 27:20.300
Where's our energy?

27:20.577 --> 27:21.983
All right, come on,
let's hurry back!

27:21.986 --> 27:23.142
I'll tell you
what the problem is...

27:23.917 --> 27:24.492
Come here!

27:24.506 --> 27:26.020
Somebody took the smash
out of the Smash.

27:26.028 --> 27:26.793
Get over here.

27:26.798 --> 27:28.280
What the hell's wrong
with you today?

27:28.747 --> 27:29.651
What?

27:29.658 --> 27:30.500
What the hell's wrong
with you?

27:30.505 --> 27:31.672
Pro left 24 pitch.

27:31.895 --> 27:32.642
I hit the right gap.

27:32.645 --> 27:33.852
Yeah, you did fine.

27:33.858 --> 27:34.513
Congratulations.

27:34.518 --> 27:36.283
You know what though?
Fine doesn't win playoff games.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.571
You're out here to win
or you go home, understood?

27:41.236 --> 27:42.482
I was just doing what I'm told.

27:42.497 --> 27:43.772
You know what?
Don't talk back to me.

27:43.957 --> 27:44.570
Talking back to me.

27:44.577 --> 27:45.553
- Think you're special?
- I'm sorry.

27:45.555 --> 27:46.942
You can talk back to me now?
Know what I what you to do?

27:46.945 --> 27:48.080
I want you to go
down the end zone.

27:48.086 --> 27:49.610
You give me 20 suicides.

27:50.056 --> 27:50.733
Coach!

27:50.737 --> 27:52.151
- 20--
- 20 suicides!

27:52.158 --> 27:53.843
In the end zone right now,
Brian!

27:57.967 --> 27:58.641
Let's go!

27:58.648 --> 28:00.311
Dank, I want some fire out here!

28:00.315 --> 28:01.681
Now let's do something!

28:01.866 --> 28:02.581
Somebody in there.

28:02.588 --> 28:04.651
We're gonna run the slants
and nail on one.

28:04.657 --> 28:05.603
- Ready?
- Break.

28:05.696 --> 28:07.310
- Set!
- Sweetheart,

28:07.975 --> 28:09.080
not for nothing,

28:09.707 --> 28:11.421
but you are tied up

28:11.428 --> 28:12.721
in knots right now.

28:14.088 --> 28:15.671
You're wound up
like a drum.

28:15.756 --> 28:16.720
Wound up?

28:17.327 --> 28:18.281
Yes, you are.

28:18.575 --> 28:19.532
And you know what?

28:19.617 --> 28:21.082
It's where Smash is gettin' it.
You know?

28:21.088 --> 28:22.261
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

28:22.268 --> 28:24.921
Well, I think, you know,
style filters down, babe.

28:25.748 --> 28:27.513
- "Style filters down"?
- Yeah.

28:27.865 --> 28:28.590
What does that mean?

28:29.295 --> 28:31.742
It means, I know
he made a mistake.

28:32.305 --> 28:33.862
I know it really
pissed you off.

28:33.907 --> 28:35.071
It really pissed me off too.

28:35.076 --> 28:36.591
But you know what?
He's a boy...

28:37.448 --> 28:38.542
He made a mistake.

28:38.636 --> 28:40.823
And he is trying so desperately
to get back

28:40.858 --> 28:42.033
in your good graces.

28:42.105 --> 28:45.242
It seems to me
you're so hard on him

28:45.425 --> 28:46.890
that he's losing his confidence.

28:47.168 --> 28:48.430
He's losing his passion.

28:48.535 --> 28:50.632
That's not gonna help you
one bit on Friday night.

28:50.648 --> 28:51.522
Here, put those over there.

28:53.135 --> 28:54.390
I think you need
to talk to him.

28:54.396 --> 28:55.670
I think you need
to turn that around.

29:00.178 --> 29:01.732
Can you put these
in the back pantry, please?

29:09.027 --> 29:10.271
There we go again.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.000
I'm actually getting kinda tired

29:13.005 --> 29:14.342
of hitting the green every time.

29:14.366 --> 29:15.141
Not bad.

29:15.216 --> 29:16.590
A little quick
on your release though.

29:16.667 --> 29:17.872
Thanks, Mr. Nicklaus.

29:18.225 --> 29:20.403
I actually would take
a swing tip from you

29:20.405 --> 29:22.151
if I wasn't kicking your ass
right now.

29:22.158 --> 29:23.051
You're only two up.

29:23.056 --> 29:24.781
There's plenty of golf
left to play.

29:24.895 --> 29:25.692
Yeah, yeah.

29:27.616 --> 29:28.810
Let me ask you something.

29:29.757 --> 29:31.210
You feeling the pressure
right now?

29:32.117 --> 29:33.561
Uh, not really.

29:34.258 --> 29:35.312
I've seen you putt.

29:42.206 --> 29:43.820
Ready, set, go!

29:58.138 --> 29:59.162
Hey,

29:59.815 --> 30:01.020
mind if I sit down?

30:01.466 --> 30:02.621
Oh, no.
Go ahead.

30:11.055 --> 30:12.010
Yeah!

30:13.015 --> 30:13.853
Yeah!

30:15.726 --> 30:16.823
We used
to have a kid like that

30:16.835 --> 30:18.060
in the neighborhood
when I was growing up.

30:18.907 --> 30:19.861
I was that kid.

30:20.457 --> 30:21.813
Yeah, I see
the resemblance.

30:23.457 --> 30:24.603
Yeah!

30:25.905 --> 30:27.013
Yeah!

30:30.446 --> 30:31.920
The reason I've been
so hard on you is--

30:33.287 --> 30:34.460
'Cause I let you down.

30:37.068 --> 30:40.440
Look, I appreciate you coming
down here, Coach.

30:40.947 --> 30:41.773
But

30:42.796 --> 30:44.053
I don't need
you to like me,

30:45.227 --> 30:47.223
okay?
I've made peace with that.

30:47.678 --> 30:49.352
So I'ma just do
what I need to do on my own.

30:49.426 --> 30:51.010
No, that's not what
I want you to do.

30:51.346 --> 30:52.911
That's not what football's
all about.

30:53.348 --> 30:55.391
You wanna fly solo,
you go run track.

30:57.538 --> 30:59.491
Sometimes we take this
so serious,

30:59.537 --> 31:01.510
we lose track of exactly why
it is we love

31:01.516 --> 31:02.613
this damn game so much,

31:02.617 --> 31:04.391
why it is we play this game.

31:09.228 --> 31:10.182
I'm guilty of that.

31:16.495 --> 31:17.141
Hey.

31:17.827 --> 31:20.001
Hey, are you
really Coach Taylor?

31:20.196 --> 31:20.972
I am.

31:21.248 --> 31:22.770
Well, you get ready for me.

31:22.968 --> 31:26.090
I'll be there the first day
of practice in 2014.

31:26.547 --> 31:27.320
Running back.

31:27.327 --> 31:28.660
Remember the name, Coach,

31:28.848 --> 31:29.820
Miles Shepard.

31:30.027 --> 31:31.071
Miles Shepard.

31:31.668 --> 31:32.882
- Shepard.
- Yup, that's my name.

31:33.215 --> 31:34.480
All right,
I'll tell you what.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.980
You give me a call when you get
out of pee-wee.

31:37.245 --> 31:38.303
I'll do that, sir.

31:38.755 --> 31:39.390
Nice.

31:41.135 --> 31:42.470
Smash, you wanna play?

31:42.665 --> 31:44.192
I need a challenge, dog.

31:45.705 --> 31:47.823
- Y'all wanna play some football?
- Yeah!

31:47.826 --> 31:48.431
Let's go!

31:48.438 --> 31:49.351
- All right, let's do it.
- Yeah!

31:49.386 --> 31:51.103
Old Smash wants to get his

31:52.138 --> 31:53.540
head handed to him.

31:55.058 --> 31:56.840
All right, who's on my team?
Who's on my team?

31:57.028 --> 31:58.052
Come here, girls.

32:01.146 --> 32:02.150
Hut-hut-hut!

32:02.195 --> 32:04.362
Go, go, go, go!

32:04.367 --> 32:05.931
Bring her out,
bring her out, bring her out.

32:07.096 --> 32:08.042
Come on, Coach!

32:08.647 --> 32:09.713
I'm gonna give you a flag.

32:19.727 --> 32:20.353
Yes!

32:20.635 --> 32:22.463
It's a ballgame
right there, boy!

32:23.075 --> 32:23.951
Ah!

32:24.147 --> 32:25.582
That was
a good effort, partner.

32:27.127 --> 32:28.800
You had me worried there
for a minute.

32:34.756 --> 32:35.570
What?

32:36.757 --> 32:38.141
You thought I was gonna
let you win?

32:38.248 --> 32:39.982
You know what, if you
didn't wanna come to the game,

32:39.988 --> 32:41.243
you could have just said so.

32:41.647 --> 32:42.953
It would have been
a lot easier.

32:43.776 --> 32:45.261
Listen to me, all right?

32:48.446 --> 32:49.282
This bit--

32:49.838 --> 32:50.512
I mean--

32:50.995 --> 32:52.981
Seeing you, you coming here,

32:52.997 --> 32:54.692
it's great hanging out with you.
And you're welcome here

32:54.718 --> 32:56.193
any time, but me going to Dillon

32:56.196 --> 32:57.730
that's a whole
different thing.

32:58.015 --> 32:58.851
Apparently.

32:58.947 --> 32:59.753
It is, son.

33:00.106 --> 33:00.930
It is.

33:01.816 --> 33:02.823
Billy was right.

33:03.917 --> 33:06.150
I shouldn't have come here
in the first place.

33:06.706 --> 33:08.010
- It was a mistake.
- Hang on, now.

33:08.115 --> 33:09.101
- You made the bet,
- It was a mistake.

33:09.106 --> 33:10.320
and I beat you
fair and square!

33:10.595 --> 33:11.813
Congratulations!

33:12.576 --> 33:14.043
Is that what you need right now?

33:14.047 --> 33:15.073
Hey, you be a man--

33:15.078 --> 33:16.122
- Be a man.
- Is that you win?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.743
- Come over here, and shake my hand.
- You win!

33:18.545 --> 33:19.233
Hey!

33:19.628 --> 33:20.340
Timmy!

33:21.146 --> 33:22.593
You get back over here

33:22.706 --> 33:24.292
and shake my hand!

33:46.367 --> 33:47.191
Hey.

33:50.446 --> 33:51.202
So how was it?

33:51.227 --> 33:52.393
Got the signature.

33:54.656 --> 33:55.671
Dad says hi.

34:00.008 --> 34:01.331
I can't believe
you spent the night.

34:09.757 --> 34:10.723
What the hell is that?

34:10.928 --> 34:11.920
What's going on?

34:11.955 --> 34:13.543
Did you order up
some rally girls?

34:13.657 --> 34:14.380
I don't know, maybe.

34:15.705 --> 34:16.342
Hi, Tim.

34:16.476 --> 34:18.161
- How you doin', ladies?
- It's time to go.

34:19.815 --> 34:21.652
I'll take some mental notes, Billy.

34:22.795 --> 34:23.413
Hey, Matt.

34:24.246 --> 34:24.909
Time to go!

34:24.966 --> 34:26.661
Help these girls
with their fundraising.

34:27.178 --> 34:28.250
Why are you touching me?

34:30.225 --> 34:31.101
Bye!

34:31.108 --> 34:31.831
Bye.

34:38.245 --> 34:39.132
Oh, my God!

34:39.136 --> 34:40.040
Perfect.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.862
That's definitely
Mr. October.

34:48.737 --> 34:50.780
Seriously, I don't know
if I can do this.

34:50.786 --> 34:51.552
What don't you know?

34:51.565 --> 34:53.239
If Julie finds out
about this--

34:53.245 --> 34:54.181
Listen,

34:54.655 --> 34:56.280
you're gonna take
a few pictures.

34:56.286 --> 34:57.473
It's for charity.

34:58.775 --> 35:00.140
Tell me straight up,

35:00.145 --> 35:01.303
are you whipped?

35:01.667 --> 35:04.160
Hey, y'all didn't tell me I need
to bring my own wardrobe.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.301
Smash, hey!

35:05.367 --> 35:07.173
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up, Smash?

35:07.176 --> 35:08.390
- How you doin', Matty?
- Good.

35:08.408 --> 35:09.823
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here, man.

35:12.846 --> 35:14.663
I didn't know you had it
in you, baby.

35:15.606 --> 35:16.323
Come on, Matt!

35:16.326 --> 35:17.822
You're gonna be my Mr. November.

35:17.885 --> 35:19.641
Come on, Matty, give me
a little Hugh Hefner.

35:19.648 --> 35:20.720
Smash, help me out.

35:21.247 --> 35:22.502
Seriously, take it off!

35:24.626 --> 35:26.423
Let me do it with my shirt on.

35:30.575 --> 35:31.761
Wait, this is seriously--

35:35.958 --> 35:36.881
Oh, oh!

35:38.105 --> 35:39.691
That's for charity!

35:46.085 --> 35:47.651
Come on, Matty, strike a pose!

35:52.856 --> 35:54.102
It's infuriating.

35:54.355 --> 35:56.063
- I'm furious.
- I know.

35:56.616 --> 35:58.012
I mean, how could
the Streets

35:58.018 --> 35:59.563
just listen to some lawyer

35:59.568 --> 36:01.802
who tells them
that they need to sue us?

36:01.838 --> 36:03.022
Baby, you know
what you're doing, don't you?

36:03.028 --> 36:04.541
I know, I know. I'm making it worse

36:04.556 --> 36:06.341
I know, I know I need
to just

36:07.215 --> 36:08.031
calm down.

36:08.036 --> 36:09.820
I need to just be supportive.

36:10.135 --> 36:11.683
- I wanna go with you today.
- No

36:11.745 --> 36:12.483
- Yes.
- No.

36:12.485 --> 36:13.751
I can have my appointments

36:13.768 --> 36:15.381
just changed to tomorrow.

36:17.268 --> 36:19.101
You know what?
There's gonna be--I need that.

36:19.688 --> 36:21.600
There are gonna be times
when I need you over

36:21.618 --> 36:23.341
at the courthouse
and times when I don't need you.

36:23.377 --> 36:24.953
Believe me,
today I do not need you.

36:24.957 --> 36:26.051
It's only gonna be a hearing.

36:26.055 --> 36:27.370
If I did need you,
I'd let you know.

36:27.378 --> 36:29.202
But I love you very much
for suggesting it.

36:29.648 --> 36:30.812
I'm all good.

36:34.066 --> 36:34.681
But thank you.

36:37.167 --> 36:38.191
I know.

36:55.326 --> 36:56.180
How you doing?

36:56.445 --> 36:57.740
I'm doing fine, Coach.
How you doing?

36:58.466 --> 36:59.200
Good.

36:59.678 --> 37:02.002
You know we're really not supposed
to be talking too much right now.

37:02.005 --> 37:03.802
Screw the lawyers.
It's not about the case.

37:05.815 --> 37:07.262
I heard about you and Lyla.

37:10.408 --> 37:12.631
I know what I want.
I don't see why it's such a big deal.

37:13.315 --> 37:14.760
I'll tell you what,
it's not a cure-all.

37:15.488 --> 37:18.070
It's the biggest damn commitment
you're gonna be making in your life.

37:19.615 --> 37:21.471
Y'all are young.
You better make sure.

37:21.576 --> 37:23.033
You better make damn sure.

37:24.178 --> 37:25.093
I am sure.

37:26.315 --> 37:27.460
I am sure.

37:27.967 --> 37:29.313
It's her that

37:29.515 --> 37:30.660
maybe is not so sure.

37:30.687 --> 37:32.061
It seems like she needs a little

37:32.248 --> 37:33.623
time to work some stuff out.

37:41.128 --> 37:42.863
No one's telling you
you shouldn't get married.

37:43.226 --> 37:45.122
What they're saying
is just take some time,

37:45.286 --> 37:46.423
feel it out.

37:49.546 --> 37:51.920
Who knows, though? You make
your future father-in-law happy,

37:51.975 --> 37:54.751
you might be able to squeeze
a damn big-ass party out of him.

37:55.536 --> 37:56.381
I don't--

37:57.295 --> 37:59.362
I do not know
about that, sir.

37:59.798 --> 38:01.952
You should have se how pissed
off he was when I told him.

38:02.076 --> 38:03.231
- Was he?
- You shoulda seen him,

38:03.236 --> 38:05.630
]that big head of his.
It was all red and...

38:14.387 --> 38:15.350
All right, Coach.

38:19.726 --> 38:20.512
Hey, Coach.

38:24.887 --> 38:26.650
I'm sorry they're making
you do this on game day.

38:27.256 --> 38:28.520
It wasn't my choice.

38:34.475 --> 38:35.562
See y'all in there.

38:46.217 --> 38:46.953
Hey.

38:46.955 --> 38:48.323
Hey.
I didn't see you in math.

38:49.506 --> 38:50.561
Um,

38:50.956 --> 38:52.052
did, uh...

38:52.636 --> 38:54.170
Did you finish the book?

38:54.555 --> 38:55.332
I did.

38:55.566 --> 38:57.013
What'd you do last night?

38:58.248 --> 38:59.770
Um, nothing, I just

38:59.785 --> 39:00.900
went to work.

39:00.908 --> 39:01.922
And then I went home.

39:04.146 --> 39:05.302
I saw the calendar.

39:05.847 --> 39:06.801
Wh-what?

39:06.975 --> 39:09.750
A bunch of the rally girls were
passing it around this morning.

39:10.966 --> 39:13.283
No, see, they totally
kidnapped me, like,

39:13.285 --> 39:14.942
like, with Riggins
the other night.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.911
But nothing happened.

39:16.915 --> 39:18.043
So it's--

39:18.398 --> 39:20.112
nothing happened at all.

39:21.445 --> 39:22.703
Why'd you lie about it?

39:24.595 --> 39:26.332
I don't know.
That was dumb.

39:27.186 --> 39:30.030
My head's just all foggy

39:30.086 --> 39:31.562
for some reason.

39:31.865 --> 39:33.693
I can't imagine why.

39:34.948 --> 39:36.730
Julie, I'm sorry.
Okay?

39:36.737 --> 39:37.430
You know what?

39:38.328 --> 39:39.351
I'm sorry too.

39:39.487 --> 39:41.571
- No, don't say that.
- I'm sorry for trusting you.

39:42.516 --> 39:44.270
But I don't appreciate
getting lied to.

39:46.085 --> 39:47.272
So why don't you go

39:47.285 --> 39:48.880
with your little rally girls

39:48.886 --> 39:51.780
and your football friends
and just leave me alone.

40:00.618 --> 40:01.901
Pure basic stuff.

40:05.948 --> 40:06.912
I'm sorry.

40:07.066 --> 40:08.682
I was on the other side
of campus.

40:09.026 --> 40:10.310
You wanted to see me,
Coach?

40:13.246 --> 40:14.662
You're starting to tailback
tonight.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.811
What the hell? You want a hug
or something? Get out of here.

40:29.027 --> 40:29.673
Go ahead.

40:36.427 --> 40:37.472
Oh, Lord, God, we just ask

40:37.478 --> 40:40.130
that you be with us
on the field tonight.

40:40.458 --> 40:43.001
God, we just ask that you just
inspire us to greatness right now.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.290
God, we ask

40:44.298 --> 40:45.462
that you protect us, Oh, Lord.

40:45.467 --> 40:48.110
We ask that you make us proud
in defeat

40:48.117 --> 40:49.702
and humble in victory.

40:50.498 --> 40:52.853
But either way, God, we just ask
that you be with us.

40:52.858 --> 40:54.020
God, you know how much we been

40:54.025 --> 40:55.180
through this season.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.741
God, we know that this game
is the key to our destiny, God.

40:58.747 --> 41:01.660
So we just ask that you give us
courage right now.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.981
God, we just ask that you give
us strength right now.

41:03.988 --> 41:05.840
We just ask that you bless

41:05.846 --> 41:07.950
each hand that we hold.
Bless all the fans

41:07.956 --> 41:10.073
and everybody out there
under those lights tonight,

41:11.727 --> 41:12.472
Amen.

41:12.618 --> 41:13.670
Amen!

41:14.245 --> 41:15.371
No tellin', baby.

41:15.746 --> 41:17.053
It's all you done, baby.

41:21.328 --> 41:23.043
Put it up!
Put it up!

41:23.908 --> 41:25.022
I said clear hearts!

41:25.028 --> 41:25.812
Full hearts!

41:25.817 --> 41:26.761
Can't lose!

41:26.768 --> 41:27.850
Clear hearts!

41:27.918 --> 41:28.681
Full hearts!

41:28.685 --> 41:30.460
- Can't lose!
- Clear Hearts!

41:30.475 --> 41:32.122
- Full hearts!
- Can't lose!

41:32.125 --> 41:33.383
Come on, baby! Let's go!

41:40.736 --> 41:41.480
Tim!

41:41.618 --> 41:42.411
Hey, Tim!

41:42.416 --> 41:43.150
What are you doing?

41:43.537 --> 41:44.933
I need
an extra ticket.

41:45.065 --> 41:47.012
Too bad, Billy.
The game's about to start.

41:47.018 --> 41:48.210
- You know that.
- Tim!

41:48.407 --> 41:49.250
What?

41:50.548 --> 41:51.781
Dad's here.
