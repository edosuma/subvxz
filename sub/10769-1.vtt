WEBVTT

00:10.210 --> 00:12.440
Oh, Lord, help me, no!

00:13.213 --> 00:14.305
Pardon me.

00:14.481 --> 00:16.676
Hey, look,
Uncle Phil, no disrespect, man...

00:16.850 --> 00:20.081
...but you got to watch
where you parking that thing.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.980
Man, you know, get some flashing lights
or some horns or something.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.456
I'm gonna just go ahead
and shut up now.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.965
You've been sitting on this couch
all morning. A little bored?

00:36.136 --> 00:39.367
- Oh, no, man. I'm cool.
- Mm.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.507
What you reading?

00:41.841 --> 00:44.639
A postcard from Carlton.
He's doing something with his summer.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.872
"Dear Big Guy.

00:51.084 --> 00:54.144
Thanks a lot for sending me
to Young Republicans Camp.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.686
Yosemite's really neat.

00:56.856 --> 01:00.690
Hey, I'm rooming
with Newt's nephew, Fig."

01:03.363 --> 01:07.129
I wouldn't make fun of them. These kids
are the future leaders of this country.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.567
Come on! Come on! Yeah!

01:11.738 --> 01:14.969
All right! Yeah!

02:34.521 --> 02:37.888
You know why you're bored, don't you?
You miss your cousin Carlton.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.082
Pfft. Ha!

02:40.994 --> 02:45.328
Please, me miss Carlton?
Pfft. I forgot all about him.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.631
Did he say when he coming back?

02:49.802 --> 02:51.702
Hi, everyone, guess what.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.032
Wolfgang Puck
is coming on my show on Monday.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.767
We're doing a cooking segment together.
Ha, ha.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.968
Miss Hilary in the kitchen?

03:03.149 --> 03:04.616
You know what? That's cool, Hil.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.651
What say we go hook something up now?
I'll help you practice.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.922
Help me cook? You must really be bored.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.481
Hey.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.355
So is everything ready
for Judge Walker's dinner tonight?

03:15.762 --> 03:17.696
- To perfection, sir.
Ha, ha.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.594
Oh, don't forget
to put up the plantation shutters, okay?

03:20.767 --> 03:23.133
I've been bragging about your cooking
to the man. Ha, ha.

03:23.303 --> 03:26.534
Hey, hey, can I come? Can I come?

03:26.706 --> 03:29.334
- Unfortunately, yes, you will be there.
- Cool.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.374
The whole family will be there.

03:31.544 --> 03:35.139
He's gonna make his decision about who is
to preside over the Show-Biz Madam Trial.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.114
Ew. She's so scuzzy.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.082
I mean, it's bad enough
that she gets hookers for married men...

03:41.254 --> 03:44.815
...but blue eye shadow? Hello.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.550
Yeah, you know, that is a little stank.

03:48.728 --> 03:54.496
Hey, G, imagine a dude so desperate
that he'll pay for sex.

03:55.668 --> 03:58.000
Imagine that.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.939
In any event,
this is a career-making case...

04:03.109 --> 04:06.044
...so I thought it'd be a good idea
to have the judge over and...

04:06.212 --> 04:08.203
- Kiss his butt?
- Exactly.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.248
And I expect all of you
to be on your best behavior.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.875
Do I make myself clear, Will?

04:15.688 --> 04:17.918
Yo, I'm gonna be cool, Uncle Phil.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.959
It's a couple of these other rabble-rousers
you need to be worried about.

04:22.795 --> 04:26.959
This is perfect. I can prepare for my show
by watching Geoffrey cook dinner tonight.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.500
Oh, dear God.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.370
Guys, I need help.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.337
I'm gonna rehearse with J.L.
and I can't decide what to wear.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.204
- I really like this one.
Ah.

04:38.378 --> 04:43.008
Well, the only way you're gonna wear
this one is if you wear that one over it.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.612
Hey, Ashley, come on,
you don't need J.L. to help you.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.451
I'll rehearse the play with you.

04:52.992 --> 04:54.550
God, Will, you must be really...

04:54.727 --> 04:57.389
Bored! Yes. Yes, I'm bored.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.497
I'll do anything with anybody.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.896
Now, somebody ask me to do something.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.967
- I'm gonna go practice my swing.
- I have better things to do.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.746
Geoffrey, call the club
and confirm our foursome...

05:16.916 --> 05:19.180
...with Judge Walker and his wife, please.
- Sir.

05:19.352 --> 05:20.910
Whoa, a foursome.

05:21.087 --> 05:24.420
You're getting a little freaky
in your old age, huh, Uncle Phil?

05:25.992 --> 05:27.391
Coming, Vivian.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.824
Hey, hey, Uncle Phil.

05:29.996 --> 05:34.194
You know, this is your last chance
to make that a fifthsome.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.696
Call me from the country club, all right?

05:41.207 --> 05:43.539
You know the number.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.612
He'll call.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.552
But, Geoffrey,
you have to teach me how to flambé.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.384
If I don't learn
I'm gonna look stupid on my show.

05:58.558 --> 06:01.118
I'm afraid that ship has sailed.

06:02.362 --> 06:06.765
- Hey, come on, G, I wanna flambé.
- Will, this is a private lesson.

06:06.933 --> 06:10.801
Geoffrey can't be bothered trying
to teach a moron to cook. Right, Geoffrey?

06:14.774 --> 06:18.210
- Come on, G, come on.
- Now then, let's flambé.

06:18.378 --> 06:23.145
First, you sprinkle this liqueur over
the bananas and then light it with a match.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.479
Oh, yo, I could do that, G.
Come on, let me light the bananas, man.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.483
- Because all I gotta do is...
- Out, Master William.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.849
Whoa, who, whoa!
Let me light the bananas.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.321
Out!

06:38.464 --> 06:40.261
All right.

06:40.433 --> 06:42.298
You light it.

06:43.603 --> 06:45.628
- Voilà.
- Ha, ha!

06:45.805 --> 06:48.831
Oh! Hey, come on, come on.
I can do that, G. Voilà.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.704
Come on, man,
you gotta let me try that. Voilà.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.210
I never knew bananas were so flammable.

06:56.949 --> 07:00.248
I'm going to kill you, you little spider jerk.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.483
Hey, yo, G.

07:05.858 --> 07:09.760
G, come on,
I'll let you be the green dude this time.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.825
Dang.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.763
Just up and leave without saying nothing.

07:17.770 --> 07:22.036
Tell me I can't do the flambé. Voilà.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.404
I can't flambé.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.690
Ooh. Ha, ha!

07:39.859 --> 07:41.793
Voilà. Ha, ha.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.091
Shoot.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.379
Oh!

08:14.660 --> 08:18.596
All right, all right. Stay down!
Down! Down!

08:18.764 --> 08:21.028
Voilà in reverse.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.065
Oh, dang!

08:30.243 --> 08:33.405
Get down! Stop it! Stop it!

08:44.924 --> 08:49.725
And I'm telling you that Waterworks and the
Electric Company are depreciable assets.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.421
I don't care,
you still have to pay a luxury tax.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.833
My dad will know.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.001
Hey, hello? Hello?

09:06.178 --> 09:08.908
Hey, Carlton, look, I can't talk right now.

09:09.081 --> 09:11.811
The kitchen's on fire.
I'm burning the house down.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.755
My house is on fire. I have to leave now.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.086
<i>Toro! Toro!</i>

09:25.698 --> 09:27.256
All right.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.579
Oh, man. Oh.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.416
Whoo. Ah.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.455
That was close. That was close.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.216
Oh, man.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.759
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.461
I almost burned the kitchen down.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.561
Oh, no! No!

10:08.708 --> 10:11.905
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!

10:16.115 --> 10:18.743
Mama, no!

10:28.628 --> 10:31.825
Our work here is done.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.828
You okay?

10:35.735 --> 10:37.930
No, I'm not okay, man.

10:38.104 --> 10:42.564
How could I do this? It ain't like I ain't done
some stupid stuff since I been out here...

10:42.742 --> 10:44.710
...but how am I supposed to explain this?

10:44.877 --> 10:48.142
Son, just how did this happen?

10:48.748 --> 10:52.514
I had a little accident cooking the flambé.

10:52.685 --> 10:56.917
Flambé? You torched your uncle's kitchen
cooking flambé?

10:59.392 --> 11:03.385
Black folks ain't supposed to cook flambé.
You stupid.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.366
Hey, guys,
sissy boy been cooking flambé.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.834
I hope I've been of assistance to you.

11:17.109 --> 11:19.805
Good evening, Master William.

11:37.630 --> 11:41.464
Of all the rooms to burn
in your uncle's house.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.465
The kitchen.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.765
Are you mad, boy?

11:45.938 --> 11:48.668
G, G, I'm telling you,
it was an accident, man.

11:48.841 --> 11:52.368
Remember I came in here
and I watched you poof the flambé?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.569
I had liked it.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.476
So then, I came in and I had poofed.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.810
But I poofed big.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.309
Too big.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.546
And I poofed the kitchen down.

12:06.459 --> 12:09.087
G, Uncle Phil's big dinner is tonight.

12:09.261 --> 12:13.095
Hey, hey.
Man, look, you gotta help me fix this.

12:13.265 --> 12:16.792
- Good day, Master William.
- G, G, where you going?

12:16.969 --> 12:19.369
I had a night of work ahead of me
in this kitchen...

12:19.538 --> 12:23.269
...but now, as you can see,
there is no kitchen. Farewell.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.466
- G, hold on.
- Cheerio.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.133
G, wait a minute. G!

12:26.312 --> 12:28.974
Listen, Uncle Phil is gonna kill me.
You gotta help me.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.742
- No.
- G. G. All right. All right.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.976
If not for me, then do it for Uncle Phil.

12:35.087 --> 12:38.215
If Uncle Phil sees this,
he's gonna blow up in front of the judge...

12:38.390 --> 12:40.551
...and that is gonna wreck his chances.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.718
All right, G, I made a mistake.

12:43.896 --> 12:44.988
I made a big mistake.

12:45.164 --> 12:49.658
But it is my mistake, not Uncle Phil's.
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.

12:50.503 --> 12:54.963
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just help me get through this dinner.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.002
Just one night, G.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.979
I'm begging you, man.

13:01.413 --> 13:02.437
Please.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.015
- No.
- G!

13:05.184 --> 13:08.642
- All right. All right.
- Hey, thanks a lot, G. All right.

13:08.821 --> 13:12.814
Look, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'm gonna see
if I can find a restaurant that'll deliver.

13:12.992 --> 13:17.986
Why don't you stay down here and see if
you can pine solve this little problem here?

13:28.207 --> 13:30.300
- Where you going?
- Los Angeles.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.841
- Hop in.
- Oh.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.106
Phew. Thanks for picking me up.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.377
I left my wallet at the hotel.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.386
Couldn't get a cab,
there are no planes or buses.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.683
Phew. Boy, am I glad to see you.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.827
Yeah. I'm glad to see you too.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.488
Halston?

13:52.464 --> 13:55.456
Whoa, this is my stop.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.939
- Excuse me. I'll be right back down.
- Okay.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.734
Well, it's a shame
your wife couldn't join us for dinner.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.467
- Why?
- Uh...

14:06.846 --> 14:10.213
Hey! Hey, look who's back from golfing.

14:10.382 --> 14:14.045
- Will, this is Judge Walker.
- Hey, nice to meet you, judge.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.481
What is that smell?

14:16.655 --> 14:18.179
Uh, well, uh, don't look at me.

14:18.357 --> 14:22.259
You the one been out there swinging them
golf clubs all day, you know what I mean?

14:22.428 --> 14:25.488
No. Mesquite?

14:25.664 --> 14:28.724
Barbecue. Phil, are we having barbecue?

14:28.901 --> 14:31.426
Is there something barbecued back there?

14:31.604 --> 14:34.573
Uh, yeah, you could say that.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.605
Why don't we walk back there
and see what is cooking?

14:36.775 --> 14:38.504
Aah! Ha, ha.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.044
Hey, uh, what, spoil the surprise?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.909
- Will.
- No, he's right.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.449
I wouldn't dream
of interrupting a chef at work.

14:46.619 --> 14:50.146
That's right. Hey, listen. Uncle Phil,
why don't you show him the library?

14:50.322 --> 14:54.759
<i>Man, Uncle Phil got some books.
Britannica, Webster's, Playboy.</i>

15:03.736 --> 15:04.828
Whoo.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.132
- Man, we dodged that bullet that time, G.
- We?

15:08.307 --> 15:11.299
Isn't that a pronoun
that would include me?

15:12.411 --> 15:15.972
You know, that little attitude of yours
isn't helping anything, G.

15:16.148 --> 15:17.945
Man, you...

15:18.117 --> 15:19.880
Got the food.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.485
Oh, my God.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.747
Ashley, all right, hold up. All right, hold...

15:23.923 --> 15:26.790
- How did this happen?
- He did it.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.427
- Does Dad know?
- No.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.495
Oh, he's gonna kill you.

15:31.664 --> 15:35.828
All right, that is exactly why we cannot
let him see this till after the judge leaves.

15:36.001 --> 15:40.335
Because murderers, they're felons,
and felons, they can't be judges.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.565
Kind of get where I'm going
with this here?

15:42.741 --> 15:46.541
So this is our little secret,
me, you and Geoffrey.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.840
Oh, my God.
- And Hilary.

15:51.784 --> 15:56.812
So what I'm saying is,
there shouldn't be a rich or poor.

15:57.222 --> 16:01.591
We should all just share the wealth, man.

16:02.061 --> 16:05.326
Oh, I beg to differ.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.945
Stanley, we didn't get a chance
to discuss this much on the golf course...

16:21.113 --> 16:24.378
...but have you given any more
consideration to the Show-Biz Madam...?

16:24.550 --> 16:28.509
Phil, have you ever eaten at that little
Hungarian place down by the courthouse?

16:28.687 --> 16:30.518
They have a delicious goulash.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.153
Could I, uh, trouble you for some water?

16:34.326 --> 16:36.157
No trouble. Where's Geoffrey?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.159
I'll get him.

16:38.630 --> 16:39.722
What are you doing?

16:39.898 --> 16:42.799
Uh, just trying to be helpful, Daddy.

16:42.968 --> 16:46.369
Hey, listen, why don't y'all just relax?
I'll get everybody some water.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.371
I'll get some water for everybody.
Ha, ha.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.541
Wouldn't it be simpler
if you just got a pitcher, Will?

16:54.380 --> 16:55.574
Good thinking, Uncle Phil.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.182
Excellent judgment,
you know what I'm saying?

16:58.350 --> 17:00.443
He got good judgment.

17:03.155 --> 17:06.646
Ain't that just like a judge?
He a good judge.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.454
G, what is taking so long?

17:13.632 --> 17:17.864
I don't know. Lack of a kitchen?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.436
Look, I need a pitcher.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.464
Ah.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.700
All right, cool.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.314
The best fried chicken in town is this joint
two blocks from the courthouse.

17:40.492 --> 17:43.017
Will, what is this?

17:44.363 --> 17:45.489
Oh, uh...

17:45.664 --> 17:48.861
That's just a little mineral water.
Go ahead, it's good for you. Drink up.

17:49.034 --> 17:52.470
You know, they make it two ways,
extra crispy and extra spicy.

17:52.971 --> 17:58.500
But I can't take the extra spicy.
Lord knows I love it, but it doesn't love me.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.076
Ah.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.440
Excuse me for, uh, just a second.

18:09.988 --> 18:13.424
lxnay on the Indian food.
Judge can't take spicy.

18:15.794 --> 18:20.356
- Come on, don't just stand there. Help me.
- This is insanity.

18:20.532 --> 18:24.434
I want no part of this, Master William.
You have gone too far.

18:24.603 --> 18:28.300
If I got to hose down some poultry
to pull this off, that's what I'm gonna do.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.135
Are you with me? Oh.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.809
Red or brown?

18:35.981 --> 18:39.007
G, red or brown?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.378
Don't make me choose.

18:40.552 --> 18:41.712
Red or brown?

18:41.887 --> 18:43.115
Ooh...

18:43.288 --> 18:45.552
- Brown.
- All right.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.856
And the next thing I know,
I'm on this train heading for home.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.528
So all in all, this has been
the most bizarre night of my life.

18:59.972 --> 19:04.671
Do you ever wonder
what makes your skin stay on?

19:10.449 --> 19:12.940
<i>Bon appétit, mesdames et messieurs.</i>

19:13.952 --> 19:18.013
- Philip, how about a toast?
- Oh. Just make it quick. It's getting cold.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.057
- To warm food. Ha, ha.
Hear, hear.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.027
Hmm.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.428
Mm.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.102
Oh, sweet mama. Now, that's chicken.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.311
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

19:40.479 --> 19:44.415
Show me a man that knows good food
and I'll show you a man of good judgment.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.381
And you, Phil,
are a man of good judgment.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.711
Yes.

19:49.888 --> 19:53.585
But before I congratulate you,
I wanna congratulate your chef.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.956
No.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.959
You know, I think we all should.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.598
Oh, but, Daddy...
Daddy, Geoffrey's so shy.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.290
Oh, we'd just embarrass him.

20:02.467 --> 20:06.130
Hey, you know what I think we all need?
A nice brisk walk around the block.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.897
- Come on, who's with me?
Oh, yeah.

20:08.073 --> 20:10.268
Have fun. Let's go.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.804
Uh, uh...

20:15.847 --> 20:17.212
Please, have a seat.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.974
Yo, Geoffrey!

20:20.452 --> 20:22.852
Ha, ha.
How was your dinner, sir?

20:23.021 --> 20:25.012
Oh, incredible. You are a magician.

20:25.190 --> 20:28.023
Oh, you're too kind. It was nothing.

20:28.193 --> 20:31.526
No more trouble than ordering in.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.560
Oh. You're much too modest.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.497
Oh, thank God you're all right.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.261
- Carlton?
- What are you doing here?

20:39.438 --> 20:42.601
When Will told me the kitchen was on fire
I didn't know what to expect.

20:42.774 --> 20:45.004
What?
- Um...

20:47.980 --> 20:50.778
We had a little mishap
in the kitchen earlier, but...

20:50.949 --> 20:54.009
- Oh!
- It's cool, though. It's cool, though.

20:57.489 --> 21:00.754
- What in the world?
- Oh, my God.

21:00.926 --> 21:05.363
You were able to prepare
a magnificent meal like that in there?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.324
I think if I could steal you away, I would.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.128
Please, hold that thought, sir.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.261
Uh, Uncle Phil, I can explain.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.968
Now, son, well the most important thing
is that you're okay.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.641
What?

21:25.550 --> 21:27.575
Things can be replaced.

21:27.753 --> 21:30.745
This is a special family.

21:30.922 --> 21:35.154
Vivian. Philip.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

21:35.327 --> 21:39.957
And this man will have you
on the Supreme Court in no time.

21:48.106 --> 21:49.937
Uncle Phil?

21:50.108 --> 21:52.668
You gonna let me go anytime soon?

21:52.844 --> 21:54.709
No, Will.

21:54.946 --> 21:56.777
That's cool.
