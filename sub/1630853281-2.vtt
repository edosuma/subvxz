Yeah, well, don't let him!

Point is everyone thinks
Snap's the good guy

No, you're right,
that's not the point.

it will blow all our stock for cash,

who got us into this mess.

You and Snap were headed for a fall
a long time ago.

Tracy was just dumb enough
to get herself in the middle of it.

don't get to 'keep' her.

Because the moment he saw your book
of open Pan Am tickets,

08:03.400 --> 08:06.360
he magically got the idea in his head
that travel was somehow free.

maybe get an advance on my allowance.

10:31.960 --> 10:35.200
Bernard, you have to learn
to live within your means

10:35.200 --> 10:36.640
or we'll have to cut you off.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.920
We will not!

10:37.920 --> 10:39.480
How else is he going to learn?

10:39.480 --> 10:41.320
Learn what? How to starve?

10:41.320 --> 10:44.040
Why should he get a free ride?
It's my choice.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.560
BARRY: There you are, boys.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.200
How old are you?

10:59.200 --> 11:02.080
You've been serving me
for six months, Barry.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.840
Come on, then.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.480
You realise they cut ME off
and WE'RE screwed, you and I?

11:11.480 --> 11:12.960
Come on, man, would they do that?

11:12.960 --> 11:16.680
All I know is if I'm not back in
college, it's over. We're done.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.400
Hey...it's cool. We'll get home.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.960
(SIGHS) Yeah, yeah. How?

11:23.960 --> 11:27.320
Snap, this, uh...this comp -

11:27.320 --> 11:29.240
is there any prize money?

11:29.240 --> 11:31.480
Well, I can float you a new wetty.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.480
And a board.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.040
Oh, is that it?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.040
Alright, mate. Things are a little
bit tight at the moment, so...

11:37.040 --> 11:38.960
So, why are you putting on a comp?

11:38.960 --> 11:40.920
For the vibe, Hunter.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.640
Yes! See that?!

11:44.880 --> 11:47.240

11:48.600 --> 11:51.320

I think I need more motivation.

11:52.320 --> 11:55.800
What if I can get Sharpie to throw
in a ticket home as first prize?

11:58.600 --> 12:00.280
Two tickets,

12:00.280 --> 12:02.320

12:26.240 --> 12:27.720
You're gonna be cold, aren't ya?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.760
Nah, any day I don't have to wear
one of those rubber monsters

12:29.760 --> 12:31.600

12:32.600 --> 12:34.360

Yeah, I'll meet you out there!

We can't wait for Trot any longer,
OK?

22:48.760 --> 22:50.320
The two of us
have been sitting on our bums,

22:50.320 --> 22:51.880
waiting for him to call
and make a decision

22:51.880 --> 22:54.160
when WE know what needs to be done!

22:54.160 --> 22:55.720
I like this new Tracy.

22:55.720 --> 22:59.360
Look, so the town's
going to be full of surfers, yeah?

22:59.360 --> 23:00.800
Yeah.
Mm.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.760
We make up a stack of extra stock and
flog them right under Snapper's nose.

23:04.760 --> 23:07.760
I'm with you, but we are
on the bones of our arse HERE.

23:07.760 --> 23:10.240
I guess it's time
you used that bony arse of yours

23:10.240 --> 23:12.520
to charm our suppliers
and extend our credit then.

23:12.520 --> 23:13.960

Classic, my arse.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.520
What do you reckon?

24:34.520 --> 24:37.360
I reckon the town's full of surfers
and we're out of stock.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.760
Fuckin' Snapper!

24:39.800 --> 24:41.400
When were you gonna tell me
about this, Trace?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.120
Oh, why didn't you call us?

24:43.120 --> 24:45.720
Because we've been
working our arses off up there.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.560
Really? 'Cause your tan's
telling a different story.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.760
Yeah, standing in the carpark,
selling shorts.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.000
Yeah, don't get me started on you.
What did I do?

24:52.000 --> 24:54.160
JULES: Alright,
shut up the lot of you!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.600
Look.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
Hey.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.560
How many of these are there?

25:03.560 --> 25:05.000

25:15.600 --> 25:17.200

25:20.040 --> 25:22.120
Hey, Dani, she should teach you
how to pour a beer.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.680
What would you know, Newbie?
SHARPIE: That American beer sucks.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.120

Hey, hey, come on, he knows beer.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.520
Thank you, thank you. Thank you.
I'm just saying, you know,

25:29.520 --> 25:30.920
she's friendly, right?

25:30.920 --> 25:34.240
I mean, the service,
it just feels nicer.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.840
Shameless, Buddy.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.120
Wait.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.720
You're S Kwong?

26:13.720 --> 26:15.800
Wait, the photographer?

26:15.800 --> 26:18.040
You're a chick!
No offence. I love your work.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.440
Yeah, it's pretty good for a girl,
right?

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
No, no, exactly, yeah.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.840
So, where are we going next?

26:45.840 --> 26:47.520
Oh...

26:47.520 --> 26:49.280
This is it.
(BOTH LAUGH)

26:49.280 --> 26:52.600
That is...very sad.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.040
Yep, I'm sorry. We've let you down.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.760
Nah. All surf towns are like this.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.960
That's why
I'm actually heading to Hawaii.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.240
Obviously.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.080
I mean, well, look,
it's actually not just the surf.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.080
My dad's there. I think.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.720
He walked out on us
when I was really little,

27:07.720 --> 27:09.160
so, I figured...

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
..now's a good time to meet him.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.560
Right.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.440
It's only ever been me and my dad.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.560
(CHUCKLES)

27:21.560 --> 27:23.200
I'm sorry.
(LAUGHS)

27:23.200 --> 27:24.360
Nah.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.600
Never say sorry.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.200
Do you wish
you were competing tomorrow?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.560
For sure.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.200
But there's no way.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.840
They barely tolerate me
out there at all.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.800
Girls get treated like shit.
It drives me crazy.

27:39.800 --> 27:40.920
Right?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.240
I grew up here,
so these boys have no choice.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.240
But the moment I go to another
beach, it's a full-on battle.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.120
So, why do you do it?

27:52.280 --> 27:55.680
There was this local in Bali,
Wayan...

27:55.680 --> 27:58.960
Snapper's taken it on,
but he stole it from Wayan.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.000
(CHUCKLES)
Anyway, um...

28:01.000 --> 28:04.840
..he used to always ask us,
"Who are you on the wave?"

28:05.840 --> 28:07.480
OK.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.320
Uh... What he's asking is, um...

28:12.320 --> 28:15.840
..do you fight it or...

28:15.840 --> 28:17.640
..are you one with the ocean?

28:18.640 --> 28:20.440
That's beautiful.

28:22.760 --> 28:26.800
It's like my head
is full of all this chatter -

28:26.800 --> 28:29.720
who I should be, who I'm not,

28:29.720 --> 28:32.040
who I'm supposed to be.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.200
And when I'm out there
it all just goes away.

28:34.200 --> 28:38.680
It's just me and the ocean.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.680
Listen to me. I sound
like I don't even know who I am.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.840
You know.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.640

at your board.

because, um...

41:40.880 --> 41:42.800
..it...it was, um...

41:43.800 --> 41:45.440
Wrong?

41:45.440 --> 41:50.760
There was more wrong with it
than just him being my best mate.

wanted to be one of them.

Hey.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.440
Are you in here, Trace?

52:33.440 --> 52:35.880
You took your time, didn't you?

52:36.880 --> 52:38.800
I've been looking for you.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.400
Do you actually think...

52:45.400 --> 52:47.400
..everything that happens here
is your idea?

52:47.400 --> 52:49.800
You took all the credit.

52:49.800 --> 52:52.400
I worked my arse off
while you were away.

52:52.400 --> 52:55.480
Yeah, well, I was only away
to fix the mess you put us in, Tracy.

52:55.480 --> 52:56.880
If I hadn't got that money for us,

52:56.880 --> 52:58.840
you'd still be sewing wetsuits
down the road.

52:58.840 --> 53:00.360
Well, at least
I could have held my head up.

53:00.360 --> 53:01.480
Is that all you have?

53:01.480 --> 53:04.240
Your hurt pride?

53:05.240 --> 53:07.600
It could have been anyone.
Why'd it have to be him?

53:08.600 --> 53:12.120
Do you actually think I enjoyed
going to him for help?

53:14.280 --> 53:16.400
Anyway, it's not him.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.920
It's always been you.

53:21.200 --> 53:25.080
If you... If you can't forgive me...

53:27.640 --> 53:29.360
..I'll leave.

53:31.320 --> 53:35.680
That was fuckin' amazing what you did
with the shorts, by the way.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.440
Thanks.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.840
Check it out.

54:11.160 --> 54:13.920
It's a full-page spread. Switchfoot.

54:13.920 --> 54:15.360
Next month.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.800
Is that Reggie?

54:16.800 --> 54:19.080
(LAUGHS)

54:19.080 --> 54:22.120
Yeah, I tried to get him to get
his arse out, but he wouldn't do it.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.440
Mm.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.240
These are...

54:26.880 --> 54:28.440
It's amazing.

54:28.440 --> 54:30.520
You like it?
Yes!

54:30.520 --> 54:32.440
(LAUGHS)

Yep.

54:57.800 --> 55:02.880
SONG: # But you won't fool
the children of the revolution

55:02.880 --> 55:05.560
# No, you won't fool

55:05.560 --> 55:08.320
# The children of the revolution

55:08.320 --> 55:13.720
# No, you won't fool
the children of the revolution

55:13.720 --> 55:16.520
# No, you won't fool

55:16.520 --> 55:19.640
# The children of the revolution

55:19.640 --> 55:21.800

55:23.920 --> 55:26.880
Get up, you lazy black bastard.
(GROANS) Get off me!

55:26.880 --> 55:29.600
Too good for the army, are ya?
Oh, you're done, mate.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.320
(CHUCKLES)

55:53.480 --> 55:54.720
Hey, Margaux.
Mwah!

55:54.720 --> 55:55.840
Oh.
Mwah!

55:55.840 --> 55:57.120
So, you're back.

55:57.120 --> 55:59.160
Old bones don't stay buried forever,
mate.

55:59.160 --> 56:01.360
Oi, Reggie!
Hey!

56:01.360 --> 56:03.400
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

56:03.400 --> 56:06.960
Is this how we raised you? To be
a hustler for your lowlife pals?

56:06.960 --> 56:08.720
Hey.
Hey.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.480
HUNTER:
I wanna make something of my own.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.280
You can pay us back
by working for the family.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.960
I've been watching young Dimma.
I'd love to take him to Indo.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.560
Look after my brother
or I'll kill you.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.560
SNAPPER: We're just going surfing,
that's all.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.960
What's this?

56:20.960 --> 56:22.320
Whoa!
