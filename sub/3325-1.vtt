00:02.170 --> 00:03.831
Previously on "Teen Wolf"...

00:04.046 --> 00:06.628
You can'ljusl go around turning
people into werewolves.

00:06.841 --> 00:07.751
I can if they're willing.

00:07.925 --> 00:09.131
Scott, I'm trying to break up with you.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.126
It's okay, because I know
we're gonna be together.

00:11.471 --> 00:12.802
It's their symbol.
And it means they're coming.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.387
- Who?
- An Alpha pack.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.007
And they're not coming.
They're already here.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.129
Quiet.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.977
Stay with me. We're almost there.

01:07.193 --> 01:08.979
- My neck.
- From their claws.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.650
It's how they share memories.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.273
But I don't remember anything.

01:12.490 --> 01:13.821
Also how they steal them.

01:13.991 --> 01:18.200
Listen to me, no matter what
happens you hold on, okay?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.111
You hold on tight.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.186
I hear something.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.565
Someone's coming.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.743
Faster!

02:22.893 --> 02:24.144
Two of them.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.132
No!

03:07.271 --> 03:08.852
Remember what I said before?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.600
Hold on?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.101
Hold on!

03:39.303 --> 03:40.213
Whoa!

03:50.272 --> 03:52.137
Isaac? Stay with me!

03:52.358 --> 03:53.518
Isaac!

04:54.587 --> 04:55.747
Isaac!

04:56.172 --> 04:57.412
Get down!

05:23.449 --> 05:25.815
I thought I told you to hold on.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.338
Boy, it's a good thing
you drew me a picture.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.423
Hey, Scott, sure you don't want
something like this?

06:34.562 --> 06:35.847
Too soon?

06:36.397 --> 06:37.352
Yeah.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.308
I don't know, man,
are you sure about this?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.231
I mean, these things are
pretty permanent, you know?

06:41.569 --> 06:42.604
I'm not changing my mind.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.651
Okay, but why two bands?

06:44.864 --> 06:45.728
I just like it.

06:45.948 --> 06:46.937
But don't you think your
first tattoo should have

06:47.157 --> 06:48.613
some sort of meaning,
you know, or something?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.191
Getting a tattoo means something.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.654
- I don't think that's...
- He's right.

06:51.996 --> 06:54.157
Tattooing goes back thousands of years.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.539
The Tahitian word "tatua"
means "to leave a mark."

06:58.210 --> 06:59.711
Like a rite of passage.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.836
Yeah, you see? He gets it.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.085
He's covered in tattoos, Scott, literally.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.545
Okay, you ready?

07:09.388 --> 07:11.674
You ain't got any problems
with needles, do you?

07:11.891 --> 07:12.971
Nope.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.436
I tend to get a little
squeamish though, so...

07:19.523 --> 07:20.729
Oh, man.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.520
- You okay?
- Kind of burns.

07:28.157 --> 07:33.072
Yes, you just had your skin stabbed
about 100,000 times with a needle.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.118
Yeah, but I don't think
it's supposed to feel like this.

07:39.043 --> 07:39.953
Oh, God.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.205
No, it's definitely not
supposed to feel like this.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.289
I gotta take this thing off.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.666
No, no, no, no, Scott. Scott, please stop.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.506
Whoa, whoa.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.963
Oh, no, what?

07:50.179 --> 07:51.794
No, no, come on.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.426
It healed.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.975
Thank God. I hated it.

08:05.861 --> 08:06.976
Sorry.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.109
It is not a double date.

08:12.368 --> 08:13.608
It is a group thing.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.154
Do they know it's a group thing?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.577
'Cause I told you that I'm not
ready to get back out there.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.781
You were in France and didn't do
any dating for four months?

08:22.211 --> 08:23.371
Did you?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.498
- I mean, after...
- Do not say his name.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.505
Is he okay?
I mean, did everything work out?

08:29.093 --> 08:31.334
Well, the doctors looked like
total idiots when he turned up alive,

08:31.512 --> 08:32.968
but everyone got over it.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.387
And yes, Derek taught him
the werewolf 101,

08:36.183 --> 08:38.549
like how not to randomly kill people
during a full moon.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.473
So then you've talked to him?

08:43.315 --> 08:45.601
Uh, not since he left for London.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.600
You mean since his dad
moved him to London.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.356
Whatever, he left.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.737
And seriously,
an American werewolf in London?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.028
Like that's not going to be a disaster.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.823
So you're totally over him?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.700
Would I be going
on a double date if I wasn't?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.582
Yes, it is a double date.

09:05.629 --> 09:06.664
It's not an orgy.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.133
You'll live.

09:11.802 --> 09:15.511
Nah, we agreed to give each other
the summer. No texts, no calls.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.046
So then how do you know
she won't be back at school then?

09:20.185 --> 09:22.676
After everything that happened,
I'm not sure she's coming back at all.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.143
I think she is.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.275
I'd say pretty definite, you know.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.982
Like 100 percent.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.880
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.378
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I can't see him, not now.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.793
Can we just drive please, Stiles?

09:56.013 --> 09:56.877
Scott, it's a red light.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.507
- Lydia, go. Just go!
- But the light.

09:58.891 --> 09:59.755
I think we should talk to her.

09:59.975 --> 10:00.885
I just think we should say something.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.637
No. No, no, Stiles, come on.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.143
- Oh, my God, dude, no.
- Hey!

10:11.153 --> 10:12.518
You know, they probably didn't see us.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.151
You all right?

10:27.503 --> 10:28.959
- What are you doing?
- I'm driving.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.001
We're right behind them.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.294
Okay, well, do you see any turns?

10:31.507 --> 10:33.418
I don't want it to look
like we're following them.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.547
Well, what do you want me to do?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.003
I don't know, anything.

10:40.682 --> 10:41.546
Lydia, stop.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.132
We need to go back and talk to them.

10:53.112 --> 10:54.101
They stopped, too.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.530
Why would they stop?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.612
It's Stiles and Scott.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.114
Do you really wanna try
applying logic to those two?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.742
Maybe we should go back.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.952
- Are you okay?
- It came out of nowhere.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.163
- Are you hurt?
- It ran right into us.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.419
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.043
Well, I'm not okay.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.722
I am totally freaking out.
How the hell does itjust run into us?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.354
I saw its eyes right before it hit us.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.974
It was like it...

11:35.154 --> 11:36.564
It was like it was crazy.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.567
No, it was scared.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.536
Actually, terrified.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.680
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.973
I know this one.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.141
What happened, Isaac?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.101
Listen, the girl, all right, she's worse, okay?

12:10.314 --> 12:11.929
- Are you not healing?
- I will. Will you just...

12:12.149 --> 12:13.810
- Would you just help her, please?
- Okay, can you take him?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.436
- We gotta move him, Melissa.
- All right, take him.

12:16.862 --> 12:17.817
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.110
Find him.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.654
- I have to find him.
- What are you saying?

12:21.033 --> 12:23.695
I have to... I have to tell him.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.867
- Who?
- The Alpha.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.952
Find the Alpha.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.701
What do you want with Derek Hale?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.619
- No.
- What?

12:33.295 --> 12:34.159
Okay, let's get her out of here.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.664
Not Hale.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.838
McCall.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.298
Scott McCall.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.667
"Ephemeral."

13:12.876 --> 13:14.412
"Lasting for a short time."

13:15.128 --> 13:17.119
"Transient. Momentary."

13:22.719 --> 13:24.095
Ephemeral.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.559
You ready?

13:34.273 --> 13:35.262
Yeah.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.766
You know, you could wait
till tomorrow if you want.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.727
I know the first day can be tough.

13:42.406 --> 13:43.361
I'm all right.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.733
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.650
Or you could wait a week,
if that would make things easier.

13:50.289 --> 13:52.575
I promised Lydia that I would drive her,
since her car's wrecked.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.622
So I should go.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.968
You know how many vehicle collisions
last year involved deer?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.098
247,000.

14:16.315 --> 14:17.851
Oh, God, please go to school.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.139
But that's crossing the road.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.099
This one last night came
right down the middle.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.189
- I'm not gonna beg you.
- Okay, good.

14:23.405 --> 14:24.861
I'm impervious to your influence anyway.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.153
Would you consider a bribe?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.106
- You couldn't meet my price.
- Extortion?

14:28.744 --> 14:29.824
You got nothing on me.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.118
Yeah.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.247
Dad, what are you doing?

14:36.460 --> 14:38.542
Dad, what are you doing?

14:39.671 --> 14:40.626
Ow.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.148
Looks good on you.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.611
So you think we could go
on a real date sometime?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.157
Hmm.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.535
Uh...

15:16.124 --> 15:17.113
Can we have sex again?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.578
Mmm.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.495
You wanna ask Derek for help?

15:57.707 --> 15:58.571
Why? Why?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.248
He's got the triskele tattooed on his back.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.042
So there has to be a way to
do it without healing, right?

16:03.255 --> 16:06.042
Okay, yeah, but still, doesn't
he have his hands a little full?

16:07.175 --> 16:09.427
Look, these are the applications
for the career advisor.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.625
I need them sorted.

16:11.179 --> 16:15.138
And whatever happened to the library
while I was gone, I want it cleared up.

16:16.184 --> 16:19.347
And what the hell is this?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.645
Go. Go. Go.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.107
Freshmen.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.520
Tons and tons of fresh men.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.397
You mean fresh boys.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.948
Lydia, they're 14.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.867
Uh, some are more mature than others.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.911
You know, it's okay to be single.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.081
Focus on yourself for a little while,
work on becoming a better person.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.202
Allison, I love you.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.878
So if you need to do that thing
where we talk about me

16:48.091 --> 16:52.334
and pretend like we're not actually
talking about you, it's totally fine.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.388
But I don't want a boyfriend.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.051
I want a distraction.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.197
Brothers?

17:18.455 --> 17:19.740
Twins.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.674
Yeah. Yeah, that's healing, visibly.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.350
Wow. They can't see this.
Nobody can see this.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.722
All right, cover it up.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.930
I don't think that's
gonna matter.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.935
I mean, you're scheduled for surgery,
which is obviously

17:48.151 --> 17:49.482
gonna be very confusing for a lot of people.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.309
Okay, can you do something?

17:52.155 --> 17:52.985
Me do something?

17:53.198 --> 17:56.361
I'm relatively new to all of this.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.112
And there's a sheriff's deputy
that's stationed right outside the door.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.318
Have you tried calling Derek?

18:00.622 --> 18:01.737
Like, five times.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.831
Do you have any other
emergency werewolf contacts?

18:05.210 --> 18:06.120
Yeah.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.623
Call Scott.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.965
Believe me, sir. I understand.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.755
But you have to understand me.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.549
- Excuse me. Hey, hey, Melissa.
- Hey.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.046
- Can you help me out here?
- Yeah.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.720
Since the amnesiac in 215
can't tell us anything,

18:19.266 --> 18:22.349
I need the girl with the modified
military stun gun in 216

18:22.561 --> 18:24.051
to answer a few questions.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.268
It's kind of unlikely,
since she's heavily sedated.

18:26.481 --> 18:27.641
Great.

18:27.857 --> 18:32.567
Well, when she un-sedates,
will you give me a call?

18:33.071 --> 18:35.483
'Cause she's got about $10,000 worth
of property damage to answer for.

18:35.699 --> 18:37.405
And I don't want her
just walking out of here.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.572
Okay.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.562
- Is someone...
- No. No, no, no, no.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.197
No, it's all you, all yours.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.612
Uh, It's totally vacant.

19:36.426 --> 19:41.261
"The offing was barred by a black bank
of clouds and the tranquil waterway,

19:41.473 --> 19:44.010
"leading to the uttermost ends
of the earth flowed somber

19:44.184 --> 19:50.896
"under an overcast sky, seemed to lead
into the heart of an immense darkness."

19:51.274 --> 19:54.937
This is the last line
to the first book we are going to read.

19:56.738 --> 20:01.357
It is also the last text
you will receive in this class.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.075
Phones off, everyone.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.909
Come on, Scott, come on.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.287
Pick up.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.133
Hello, Isaac.

20:26.184 --> 20:27.549
- Hi.
- How we feeling?

20:27.894 --> 20:30.135
Good. Listen, I think I could probablyjust...

20:36.403 --> 20:37.859
What is that?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.686
Just an anesthetic.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.274
We don't want you getting
in the way again.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.249
Count along with me, Isaac.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.139
One. Two.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.139
Three.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.658
Mr. McCall?

21:39.048 --> 21:42.336
I'm sure it's an emergency
if your mother needs you to leave school,

21:42.552 --> 21:46.340
but I'm gonna give you a warning
in the nicest possible way.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.139
I am well aware of your attendance record.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.972
I don't wanna see you slip
back into old habits.

21:53.188 --> 21:53.973
I won't.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.304
It's gonna be different this year.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.848
Resolutions are only good
if you stick with them, Scott.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.102
I will.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.021
I promise it won't be ephemeral.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.714
Hey, Lydia.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.093
What is that? Is that from the accident?

22:32.352 --> 22:34.263
No. Prada bit me.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.178
Your dog?

22:36.356 --> 22:37.641
No, my designer handbag.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.648
Yes, my dog.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.859
Has it ever bitten you before?

22:47.158 --> 22:47.988
Mmm-mmm.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.112
Okay. What if it's, like,
the same thing as the deer?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.034
You know, like,
how animals start acting weird

22:52.247 --> 22:53.453
right before an earthquake or something?

22:54.916 --> 22:57.123
Meaning what?
There's gonna be an earthquake?

22:57.293 --> 22:58.749
Or something.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.122
Maybe it means something's coming.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.457
Something bad.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.331
It was a deer and a dog.

23:05.593 --> 23:06.969
What's that thing you say about threes?

23:07.262 --> 23:08.468
Once, twice...

23:43.631 --> 23:45.292
Get down, everyone!

23:53.892 --> 23:55.132
Get down! Get down!

23:55.685 --> 23:56.640
Get down!

23:56.853 --> 23:57.968
Get down!

24:28.885 --> 24:30.000
Why didn't you tell me before?

24:30.219 --> 24:32.346
Honestly, I was hoping I didn't have to.

24:32.555 --> 24:33.965
What do you mean?

24:34.182 --> 24:36.093
Everything that you've been doing,
the extra reading,

24:36.309 --> 24:38.220
the summer school, saving up for the bike,

24:38.394 --> 24:39.975
even though it scares me half to death...

24:40.188 --> 24:41.849
Honey, I just didn't wanna
disrupt a good rhythm.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.309
It's not gonna stop.
I'm gonna be better this year.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.021
A better student, a better son,
a better friend, a better everything.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.647
I promise.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.319
Okay.

24:51.950 --> 24:54.157
He's in room 215
if he isn't already in surgery.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.783
Okay. Thank you.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.552
Would you hit the button
for the second floor, please?

25:23.898 --> 25:25.104
Yeah.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.070
Thank you.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.081
What the hell is this?

25:50.091 --> 25:51.672
Does someone want to explain this to me?

25:54.595 --> 25:56.802
You wouldn't mind helping me
out for a second, would you?

25:57.682 --> 26:00.924
Um, sure.

26:06.983 --> 26:07.938
Here's an idea.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.895
Why don't you wheel this joker
out of here and get somebody

26:10.111 --> 26:11.317
that actually needs to be operated on?

26:12.822 --> 26:13.857
Now!

26:14.741 --> 26:16.527
I'm gonna go smoke.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.842
Don't you realize what
you're dealing with?

28:04.642 --> 28:06.143
I'm an Alpha.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.646
So am I.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.856
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

28:33.171 --> 28:34.126
Ms. Blake?

28:34.338 --> 28:35.839
You okay?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.966
Sorry, just... That.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.305
Next time you're feeling you
wanna stay home, you stay home.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.805
I'm okay.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.930
- But, dad, the deer and now this?
- I know. I know.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.686
It can't be a coincidence.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.938
Mr. Argent, you wouldn't have
any insight into this, would you?

29:02.283 --> 29:03.489
- Me?
- Yeah.

29:03.951 --> 29:06.488
All this bizarre animal behavior, it's...

29:06.829 --> 29:08.660
You must have seen something
like this before, right?

29:09.165 --> 29:11.872
I'm not sure why I would
or why you would think I would.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.081
I'm sorry.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.707
I could've sworn I overheard my son

29:17.924 --> 29:19.539
talking about how you were
an experienced hunter.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.128
Ah, right.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.136
Well, not anymore.

29:27.767 --> 29:28.802
You all right?

29:28.976 --> 29:30.056
Yeah.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.561
We got a serious problem at school.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.317
- Ms. Blake's class...
- Hey, can you tell me about it later?

29:40.529 --> 29:42.611
Uh, well, no, pretty sure this qualifies
for immediate discussion.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.314
- All right, then meet me at Derek's.
- Derek's house? What?

29:45.534 --> 29:47.820
- What the hell are you doing at...
- Just meet us here, okay?

29:52.166 --> 29:54.122
You don't still live here, do you?

29:54.794 --> 29:55.829
No.

29:56.170 --> 29:58.161
The county took it over,
but there's something here that I need.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.921
It'll help heal a wound from an Alpha.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.464
Yeah, but it did heal.

30:04.345 --> 30:05.676
Not on the inside.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.764
Hey, are you gonna tell me
who that was back there?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.398
That Alpha.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.438
A rival pack.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.813
It's my problem.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.406
I know you wanna help, and you did.
I owe you one.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.444
Now go home.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.944
Go back to being a teenager.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.589
Hey, Derek.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.919
If you wanna repay back that favor now,

30:50.057 --> 30:51.797
there is something you can do for me.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.096
Is it me or is Beacon Hills
turning into more like

30:58.566 --> 31:00.648
beacon for the totally bizarre
and supernatural?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.321
Where's Scott McCall?

31:05.573 --> 31:06.858
You're Allison, right?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.106
- Yeah, how do you know...
- Where's Scott?

31:10.036 --> 31:11.492
He had to leave.
He was supposed to be back in class...

31:11.704 --> 31:12.614
- Is he coming back?
- Hey.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.245
Easy with the physicality, sweetheart.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.511
Well, she bruised me.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.311
Huh. Me, too.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.851
Come on, let's get you
two girls out of here.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.100
School can wait another day.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.145
Sweetheart?

31:45.196 --> 31:46.231
Hey.

31:46.864 --> 31:48.695
You don't have to worry
about this anymore.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.114
Remember our agreement?

31:51.452 --> 31:53.693
We stay in Beacon Hills,
but only if we stay out of this.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.403
It's not our problem now.

31:58.167 --> 31:59.122
Okay?

32:03.964 --> 32:06.125
We've had 15 calls in the past hour.

32:07.051 --> 32:10.043
I got a suicidal deer,
birds flying through windows,

32:10.262 --> 32:11.968
pets behaving aggressively.

32:12.181 --> 32:14.763
I gotta tell you, I'm starting to
think there's something in the water.

32:15.393 --> 32:18.135
To be honest, I was gonna give you
a call about an incident of my own.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.314
At first, I thought I might
have had a break-in.

32:23.526 --> 32:27.895
Some sick individual looking to release
a particularly violent impulse.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.192
Until I got a closer look
and realized what actually happened.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.947
They did it to themselves.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.423
Yeah, I see it.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.960
It's two bands, right?

32:51.679 --> 32:53.215
What does it mean?

32:56.434 --> 32:57.970
I don't know.

32:58.519 --> 33:01.135
It's just something I traced with my fingers.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.277
Why is this so important to you?

33:12.950 --> 33:14.611
Do you know
what the word "tattoo" means?

33:15.536 --> 33:17.117
To mark something.

33:18.414 --> 33:20.370
Well, that's in Tahitian.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.958
In Samoan, it means "open wound."

33:26.714 --> 33:29.046
I knew I wanted to get a tattoo
when I turned 18.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.123
I always wanted one.

33:32.344 --> 33:36.053
I just decided to get it now,
to make it kind of a reward.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.343
For what?

33:40.853 --> 33:43.265
For not calling
or texting Allison all summer.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.939
Even when I really wanted to,

33:48.152 --> 33:51.986
even when it was so hard
not to sometimes.

33:55.618 --> 33:58.325
I was trying to give her
the space she wants.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.248
Going four months later, it still hurts.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.172
It still feels like a...

34:11.717 --> 34:13.298
Like an open wound.

34:14.136 --> 34:15.125
Yeah.

34:20.267 --> 34:21.973
The pain's gonna be worse
than anything you've ever felt.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.596
Oh, that's great.

34:24.522 --> 34:25.477
Do it.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.691
Oh, wow.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.143
That's a lot for me.

34:32.363 --> 34:33.944
So I'm gonna take that as my cue.

34:34.156 --> 34:35.316
I'm just gonna wait outside.

34:35.533 --> 34:36.613
Nope.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.695
You can help hold him down.

34:49.338 --> 34:50.748
Oh, my God.

35:01.225 --> 35:02.635
Hold him.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.782
It worked.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.922
Well, it looks pretty damn permanent now.

35:44.101 --> 35:45.136
Yeah.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.350
I kind of needed something permanent.

35:48.147 --> 35:52.265
Everything that's happened to us,
everything just changes so fast.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.938
Everything's so...

35:56.989 --> 35:58.104
Ephemeral.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.399
Studying for the PSATs?

36:01.577 --> 36:02.692
- Yep.
- Nice.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.409
You painted the door.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.584
Why'd you paint the door?

36:18.177 --> 36:19.713
Go home, Scott.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.718
And why only one side?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.815
Scott.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.608
The birds at school and the deer last night,

37:18.821 --> 37:22.405
just like the night I got trampled
by the deer when I got bit by the Alpha.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.032
How many are there?

37:27.204 --> 37:28.785
A pack of them.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.249
An Alpha pack.

38:02.156 --> 38:04.067
All of them? How does that even work?

38:04.324 --> 38:05.860
I hear there's some kind of a leader.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.026
He's called Deucalion.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.595
We know they have Boyd and Erica.

38:33.687 --> 38:36.394
Peter, Isaac, and I have been looking
for them for the last four months.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.349
Let's say you find them.

38:42.237 --> 38:43.852
How do you deal with an Alpha pack?

38:45.157 --> 38:46.567
With all the help I can get.

38:49.161 --> 38:50.401
Where is she?

38:51.747 --> 38:53.237
Where's the girl?

38:56.376 --> 38:57.707
What girl?

39:13.602 --> 39:14.967
Beautiful.

39:17.231 --> 39:19.142
But defiant, aren't you?

39:20.150 --> 39:22.106
Because I know something.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.234
I know you're afraid of him.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.531
Of a teenage boy?

39:27.199 --> 39:29.110
Of the man he'll become.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.276
I'm aware of a certain potential threat.

39:33.372 --> 39:37.240
But then someone once taught me
a very smart way to eliminate threat.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.284
Get someone else to do it for you.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.291
Derek.

39:55.644 --> 39:57.430
This one, it's perfect.

39:57.646 --> 40:00.979
I don't know.
I'm still thinking maybe a shade of blue.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.860
Lydia, look.
