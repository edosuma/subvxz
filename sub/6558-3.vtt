WEBVTT

00:41.000 --> 00:42.543
Uh-oh! Uh-uh!

00:52.178 --> 00:53.971
Shh!

01:36.055 --> 01:39.517
You sure picked a spooky day
to go boating, Freddy.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.770
It didn't start out that way.
What could have happened?

01:42.979 --> 01:46.482
It's very simple.
When the barometric pressure dropped...

01:46.607 --> 01:50.111
and warm air came in
contact with an inland cold front...

01:50.278 --> 01:52.613
we ran into some
unnavigable nubilation.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.366
You're right, Velma,
whatever you said.

01:55.533 --> 01:59.203
- I said, we're lost in a fog.
- You buzzed?

01:59.370 --> 02:01.706
No, Shaggy. Go back to sleep.

02:01.914 --> 02:06.043
Sleep, nothing. I'm fixing me
a super Shaggy sandwich.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.880
Like, wow, my favorite:

02:10.047 --> 02:14.218
A double-triple-decker sardine
and marshmallow-fudge sandwich.

02:14.385 --> 02:20.558
Open the mouth, between the gums.
Look out, stomach. Here it comes.

02:22.435 --> 02:25.730
Well, at least you left me the olive.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.402
With him around, I can't
even get a bite in edgewise.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.948
- Now what happened?
- Looks like we've run aground.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.785
- Yeah, but, like, where?
- Well, if I'm not mistaken...

02:40.036 --> 02:43.039
it looks like we're stuck
on Haunted Isle.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.540
I'm sorry I asked.

02:44.665 --> 02:49.754
The old Vasquez Castle's on this island.
Maybe we can find help there.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.591
This sure is a creepy place.

02:53.758 --> 02:56.927
Yeah, a regular gruesome camp.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.559
Huh?

03:04.643 --> 03:06.479
YikeS!

03:33.464 --> 03:35.132
Like, what's with Scooby-Doo?

03:46.477 --> 03:50.398
Hey, if you wanna play in the sand,
Scooby, leave us out of it, huh?

03:54.819 --> 03:57.655
Hey, what's this?
It's a torn piece of map.

04:00.699 --> 04:05.329
D-A-N-G-E-R.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.498
Danger?

04:08.124 --> 04:09.834
Hey!

04:11.502 --> 04:13.629
Look, it's, like, a message!

04:13.754 --> 04:17.216
It says, "Danger. Leave Haunted Isle."

04:17.425 --> 04:21.429
It sure looks like someone is trying
to scare us off this island.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.639
But who? And why?

04:23.764 --> 04:27.351
I don't know, but it looks
like we found ourselves a mystery...

04:27.518 --> 04:30.563
and maybe we'll find the answer
at that castle.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.858
- Come on, let's go!
- Oh, boy!

04:50.207 --> 04:52.793
Well, here it is. Old Vasquez Castle.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.673
Man, what a pad for a scare-in.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.678
The place looks deserted.

05:07.391 --> 05:11.604
That's Vasquez, the pirate.
He sailed the seas in 1612.

05:12.229 --> 05:15.107
He must have used this old castle
for a hideout.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.277
Come on. Let's take a look around.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.246
Man, like, plenty spooky!

05:34.418 --> 05:37.463
I once read these old castles
were loaded with traps.

05:37.630 --> 05:42.426
Oh, Velma, don't be silly.
That only happens in movies!

05:43.761 --> 05:47.139
- Daphne! Daphne!
- What happened?

05:47.306 --> 05:49.350
Daphne fell through a trap door!

05:52.436 --> 05:54.271
Zoinks!

06:09.161 --> 06:11.288
Come on. We gotta find Daphne.

06:11.455 --> 06:12.831
But what about that:

06:15.042 --> 06:18.170
It was probably just the wind.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.757
That's the first wind I heard
with a sense of humor.

06:21.924 --> 06:26.428
- Come on, put your nose to work.
- Right.

06:30.766 --> 06:33.936
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

06:38.440 --> 06:43.279
Wow! I wonder how I get out
of this creepy inner sanctum.

06:43.445 --> 06:47.616
Well, my intuition tells me that way.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.796
Stop that whistling.
You make me nervous.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.929
Uh-oh!
Like, which way did they go?

07:09.179 --> 07:12.766
- They went thattaway.
- Oh, thanks, man.

07:12.850 --> 07:13.892
It's all right.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.860
- Like, wow! A talking skull.
- Like, wow!

07:23.402 --> 07:24.820
I'm so scared.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.574
I wish I had a ham sandwich
to calm my nerves.

07:30.618 --> 07:34.580
Well, what do you know,
a ham sandwich!

07:34.747 --> 07:37.458
Wouldn't you know,
it needs some mustard.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.878
This has gotta be my imagination.
Otherwise, I'd be scared.

07:44.256 --> 07:49.136
Now, maybe my imagination
can, like, cut it in half.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.980
Someone's coming.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.733
Shaggy!

08:03.233 --> 08:06.612
Ohh. Hi, Daphne.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.074
Hey, look. Shaggy found Daphne.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.576
- For once, he used his head.
- Ohh.

08:12.785 --> 08:14.620
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

08:14.787 --> 08:17.289
Just as soon as I have
six or seven sandwiches.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.750
He's all right, all right.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.174
There goes that crazy wind again.

08:27.383 --> 08:30.594
Crazy wind, nothing. Look!

08:31.762 --> 08:33.472
I warn you.

08:33.639 --> 08:37.267
Leave Haunted Isle and never return.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.938
The phantom has spoken.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.111
Grab that phantom!

09:05.796 --> 09:07.339
Did you see that?

09:07.840 --> 09:08.924
Yeah!

09:09.049 --> 09:11.844
Like, he went through the wall, nonstop.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.848
- There's a logical explanation for this.
- Quick, tell me.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.183
- The place is haunted.
- Thanks a lot.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.979
Why don't we take that
phantom man's advice and clear out.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.355
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:23.522 --> 09:25.983
No, Shag. We're not going.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.361
- Like, why not?
- Three good reasons, Shaggy.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.573
First, no phantom's
gonna scare us away.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.660
Second, why does he want us
off this island so bad?

09:36.827 --> 09:40.247
- And third, we're marooned.
- I'II buy that last one.

09:40.456 --> 09:43.000
Hey, fellas, over here. A clue.

09:43.333 --> 09:47.254
I found a key in this chest.
It must belong to the phantom.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.840
Hey, there's some writing on it.

09:50.007 --> 09:53.844
It says, "Second passage
of the old bell."

09:54.011 --> 09:56.096
- Second passage?
- Old bell?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.890
There's no old bell in this castle.

09:57.973 --> 09:58.973
Hmm.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.020
I've got it. "Passage" must mean
a passage in a book.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.898
Then The Old <i>Bell</i> must be
the name of a book!

10:06.064 --> 10:07.191
That's right.

10:07.399 --> 10:10.778
And the best place to find a book
is in the library.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.988
Right. Come on!

10:15.491 --> 10:17.868
This is the book called The Old <i>Bell.</i>

10:18.035 --> 10:23.207
Look, in the second passage, the
word "catacombs" is underlined in red.

10:23.373 --> 10:29.004
If my knowledge is correct, we should
find catacombs in the basement.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.221
This is the place.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.650
Okay, Scooby. Go in and take a look
around. We'll keep watch out here.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.195
No, I'm not kidding.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.080
There he goes
with his fake-wounded routine.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.082
What a ham.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.257
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.801
- Uh-uh.
- How about two?

11:15.968 --> 11:19.012
- Three?
- Okay, three.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.354
Scooby-Doo!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.905
Huh?

11:45.706 --> 11:47.499
Huh?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.267
Hmm.

12:06.435 --> 12:09.313
Scooby says it's okay.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.443
Man, look at all that
crazy magic stuff.

12:14.651 --> 12:20.198
A saw-them-in-two box,
disappearing cabinets, levitating tables.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.200
Gosh!

12:22.701 --> 12:25.662
But what's all this magic stuff
doing here?

12:26.163 --> 12:29.416
I think I'm beginning
to figure it out.

12:30.334 --> 12:34.588
Shh! Somebody's coming!
Quick! Into the closet! Hurry!

12:38.300 --> 12:41.845
Whoever it was must've gone away.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.225
Look! The phantom!

12:47.392 --> 12:50.979
I warned you to leave the island!

12:51.188 --> 12:52.898
Now you will pay!

12:53.398 --> 12:56.193
I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.196
Not that kind of pay.
Let's get out of here!

13:11.375 --> 13:13.835
- Ugh!
- Huh?

13:14.044 --> 13:15.921
Help! Help!

13:17.214 --> 13:19.424
- Shaggy!
- Help!

13:19.633 --> 13:21.301
Shaggy!

13:25.430 --> 13:28.016
Hey, this is just a dummy head!

13:30.936 --> 13:33.480
Someone mention me?

13:41.947 --> 13:44.866
- Hey, look!
- A magic carpet!

13:45.951 --> 13:49.788
I hope this trick works.
Ali, go oop.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.377
Wait for me!

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
Huh?

14:30.078 --> 14:32.289
- Well, we've lost him.
- Groovy.

14:32.414 --> 14:35.083
- Now we gotta catch him.
- Not groovy.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.295
If we're ever gonna
solve this mystery...

14:38.420 --> 14:42.466
- But how?
- Simple, and with just a few things.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.802
That suit of armor and crossbow...

14:45.969 --> 14:48.847
that cannonball and old spring...

14:50.891 --> 14:52.476
I gotta hand it to you, Fred.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.228
You really know
how to build a better mousetrap.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.397
In this case, a better phantom trap.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.358
But what good is it?
We can't catch a phantom.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.236
I have a hunch that we can,
right, Velma?

15:03.445 --> 15:07.032
Check, but first we'll have to
find him and lure him here.

15:07.199 --> 15:10.952
- But how do we find the phantom?
- We don't. Scooby does.

15:11.119 --> 15:12.913
Scooby does?

15:13.371 --> 15:18.585
Right. With your super-sleuth nose,
you'll be able to sniff him out.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.881
Achoo!

15:23.090 --> 15:24.341
Well, look at him.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.469
Achoo! Achoo!

15:28.220 --> 15:30.847
My nose. Cold in my nose.

15:30.972 --> 15:34.059
Cut it out.
You don't have a cold in your nose.

15:34.226 --> 15:37.771
How do we know the phantom
will chase Scooby-Doo?

15:37.938 --> 15:42.359
- He's a dog.
- Don't worry. We'll soon fix that.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.706
Come on, Scooby. Be brave.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.294
Just think of Rin Din Din.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.839
Lassie.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.134
John Wayne.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.803
John Wayne?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.556
- John Wayne?
- Sure, Scooby.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.142
Scooby-Doo!

16:19.813 --> 16:23.316
Like I said before, what a ham.

16:25.861 --> 16:30.282
Yoo-hoo! Phantom! Yoo-hoo!

16:35.120 --> 16:38.039
Yoo-hoo! Phantom!

16:38.331 --> 16:39.958
Not here.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.801
Hello?

17:18.288 --> 17:20.832
<i>Yah-yah-yah-yah, yah-yah'.!</i>

17:28.506 --> 17:31.384
You cannot escape me.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.388
Scooby-Doo!

17:47.859 --> 17:51.321
Boo! Boo! Boo!

17:53.365 --> 17:55.116
Scooby-Doo!

18:08.171 --> 18:10.715
Get ready! Here they come!

18:13.677 --> 18:15.136
Jump, Scooby!

18:15.303 --> 18:16.388
Huh?

18:20.100 --> 18:22.727
Oh, no! Scooby tripped into our trap.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.343
Now you will not escape me.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.440
- We caught the phantom!
- Thanks to Scooby-Doo!

19:08.940 --> 19:10.608
AWW -

19:12.610 --> 19:17.324
When the fog lifted, we spotted your
beached boat and decided to investigate.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.243
- But who is that?
- This?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.662
This is the end of the mystery.

19:22.829 --> 19:26.166
Well, if it isn't our old friend
Bluestone the Great...

19:26.374 --> 19:30.962
- an ex-magician wanted in six states.
- But what is he doing here?

19:31.171 --> 19:36.718
He must have heard the legend of the
Vasquez treasure. Everybody's after it.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.178
I get it.

19:38.345 --> 19:42.849
He used his magic tricks
to keep people away from the island...

19:43.016 --> 19:46.478
- while he searched for it.
- When he saw us...

19:46.644 --> 19:51.649
- he tried to scare us away.
- Well, his scaring days are over.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.486
He's going to do
a final disappearing act...

19:54.652 --> 19:56.446
courtesy of the local jail.

19:56.654 --> 20:00.950
There's one more thing.
We figured out all those floating tricks.

20:01.159 --> 20:05.330
- Look, no hands!
- See? Wires.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.458
But how did you walk
right through a solid wall?

20:08.666 --> 20:12.587
One of my best acts.
Let me give one last performance.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.506
Hold this rope.

20:14.714 --> 20:19.844
It was merely an illusion done with
trick mirrors and a special projector.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.972
I could cast my image
anywhere I wanted...

20:23.181 --> 20:27.685
and by stepping away from the mirror,
it appears that I walk through walls.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.105
I must admit, Mr. Bluestone...

20:30.271 --> 20:33.483
you're a good magician,
but a bad phantom.

20:33.691 --> 20:38.363
Man, I wonder if, like,
there really is a treasure.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.742
That's Scooby barking.
Come on!

20:46.788 --> 20:50.375
- Look! Scooby found something.
- Maybe it's the treasure.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.431
Well, Scooby-dee-Doo.
