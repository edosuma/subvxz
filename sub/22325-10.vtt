Jacob:
What's a conservatory?

00:59.327 --> 01:02.296
It's a room you grow plants in,
like a -- like a greenhouse.

A greenhouse in your house.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.966

01:05.999 --> 01:08.602
Uh, because I work in
the industry.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.605
Also, there are plants
right there.

He had a gun.

of satisfaction.

defeated the purpose.

You would never do that.

Maybe.

I...

16:20.347 --> 16:21.914
I just named him.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.185
Should I turn off
his phone?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.653
No, leave it on
for awhile.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.856
It's good if it looks like
he drove around a little more.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.627
I turned it off.

16:34.661 --> 16:38.065
I know, but I still
would like to keep it.

16:48.375 --> 16:56.349
**

16:56.383 --> 16:57.817
Shit.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.854

Hi.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.578

Yeah.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.050
And your license.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.852
Oh, shit.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.022
I...I think I left my wallet

17:36.055 --> 17:38.258
at my last appointment.

17:38.291 --> 17:42.529
You know, I took it out to
give 'em my -- my business card.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.798
Shit, I think I must've
left it there.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.202
That's unfortunate, Mister...

17:49.236 --> 17:52.105
Patrick Donnelly.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.407
May I ask why
you pulled me over?

17:54.441 --> 17:56.243
Your left brake light
is out.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.612
Yes.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.064
"I'll handle it."

18:18.097 --> 18:20.667
I love that
he texted you that.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.270
Code for,
"I'm going to kill her."

18:23.303 --> 18:25.238
Blam! Right in her face.

18:25.272 --> 18:30.143
I mean, that is literally
his job.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.478
He's not gonna kill her.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.012
You're right.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.315
He's got so much on his plate
cleaning up your mess,

18:35.348 --> 18:38.751
he probably doesn't wanna
make one of his own.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.254
Why do you sound like
that now?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.990
Like what?
Like a douchebag.

18:44.023 --> 18:46.693
Well,
maybe I was a douchebag.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.295
You had your wife
in your phone as "Honey."

18:48.328 --> 18:50.797
Maybe that's the name of
the stripper I live with.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.300
Honey is
a great stripper name.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.202
Or maybe it is my wife.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.136
And maybe I cheat on her

18:57.170 --> 18:58.871
or I smack her around.

18:58.905 --> 19:02.275
Not anymore.
Right. Thanks to you.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.111
It was an accident.
"It was an accident."

19:05.144 --> 19:06.979
"It's because of my mom."

19:07.013 --> 19:09.682
"Oh, no,
it's because of Sean."

19:09.716 --> 19:10.983
"It's how I was raised."

19:11.017 --> 19:13.853
"It because of the system!"
Shut up.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.988
Isn't it time for you
to admit

19:16.022 --> 19:18.791
that your bullshit
drags everyone down?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.694
You're the worst.
Yeah. Maybe.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.031
But at least I never
murdered anyone.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.718
One of the brake lights
is out. She let me go.

19:45.752 --> 19:49.756

off now. Let's go.

running away from him.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.949
You'll never see him again,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.951
but it is
the smart thing to do

20:18.985 --> 20:22.422
because then, he would never
have to see you again.

I know.

His name was
Patrick Donnelly.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.012
I know.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.614
I had to tell that cop
who pulled me over

24:41.648 --> 24:43.516
that I was Patrick Donnelly.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.821
She believed me.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.495
Why did you wave?

24:56.529 --> 24:58.230
'Cause that's what they do.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.333
It's like, "Hey, bro, we work
for the same company."

25:01.367 --> 25:05.371
You're not a bro. You're in
the passenger seat. Just...

25:05.404 --> 25:07.206
Don't draw attention.

you know I'm Patrick Donnelly,

26:02.795 --> 26:05.097
you've turned me
into a stereotype.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.433

a bloody leprechaun.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.404
They're not gonna find you.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.341
Yeah, they will,
when they find you.

you know.

Oh, you're gonna try to
blame this on me, are ya?

26:21.280 --> 26:24.550
You're a real piece of work.
So stop hanging out with me.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.252
You think that's up to you?

26:26.285 --> 26:28.120
I don't know which version
of "A Christmas Carol"

26:28.154 --> 26:32.391
you're familiar with,
but the ghosts are in charge.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.926
You're not a ghost,

26:33.960 --> 26:36.996
and I'm not gonna let
some leprechaun ruin my life.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.798
We should stop and get
that brake light fixed

26:38.831 --> 26:40.399
so we don't get
pulled over again.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.069
No, we're not stopping.
We're just getting rid of you.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.073
Woman: Donnelly 34.
Donnelly 34, come in.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.407
Patrick: We should stop
and get that brake light fixed

26:48.440 --> 26:51.310
so we don't get
pulled over again.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.611
You just said that.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.782
What?
We should get it fixed.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.086
Don't stop driving.

Them.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.935

"A Christmas Carol"?

27:15.968 --> 27:19.205
I know a lot
of Christmas carols.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.941
No, I mean the book.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.677
Or the movie or whatever.
"A Christmas Carol."

27:24.711 --> 27:27.714
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Yeah, the, uh, ghosts.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.348
Right.

27:29.381 --> 27:33.552
Would you say that the ghosts
are in charge?

27:33.585 --> 27:36.022
Woman: Donnelly 34, we've been
trying your cellphone.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.290
You didn't show up
for your last appointment.

27:38.324 --> 27:41.293
Need your 20.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.295
Man: Yeah, this is 62.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.232
I saw van 34
just outside of Vidalia.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.801
Dude had a girl in
the passenger seat.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.402
She was hot.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.972
Man: Donnelly, I don't know
why you're up in Vidalia

27:53.005 --> 27:54.707
or why you're cheatin'
on Melissa,

27:54.741 --> 27:56.142
but you'd better turn around

27:56.175 --> 27:57.710
because if you don't bring
my van back

27:57.744 --> 27:59.211
before the end of the day,

27:59.245 --> 28:02.081
I'm calling the police
and reporting it stolen.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.859
So I killed the guy
and I made it look like

28:12.892 --> 28:14.660
he was cheating on
his wife.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.600
Wait, that's a motive.

28:21.633 --> 28:26.005
The guy was cheating and he ran
away to start a new life.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.074
Or...killed himself
or something.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.742
If the police
ever get involved,

28:29.776 --> 28:31.811
that's the first thing
they'll think.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.284
**

28:38.317 --> 28:41.053
I never
cheated on my wife.

29:08.014 --> 29:11.717
How many miles was that
from the main road?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.820
18, 19.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.891
That's a long way
to walk back.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.160
If you hadn't driven away...

29:46.819 --> 29:48.254
What are you doing?

29:48.287 --> 29:50.857
I have to set up
the bodies to burn.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.961
You didn't bring
lighter fluid?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.996
That will only burn
their skin away,

29:57.029 --> 29:59.131
and then the fire will
go out.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.045
Okay.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.547
I need your, uh, lighter.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.861
**

30:28.895 --> 30:31.163
S-smack it upside down.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.807
Just give it to me.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.978
**

30:49.848 --> 30:52.551
Fuck.

30:52.584 --> 30:57.189
Maybe the van has one of those
push...lighter things.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.660
Nope.

31:01.693 --> 31:05.031
The hole is there for thing,
but the thing isn't there.

31:05.064 --> 31:08.267
Maybe he has flares.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.539
Yes.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.210
No flares.

31:18.244 --> 31:21.613

Teo. He smoked.

go away now.

Why?

all goodbye *

I mean, compared to...

I never thought you were.

Police are not looking for us.
The house is clean.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.427
Because we mopped up blood
and burned the bodies,

34:21.460 --> 34:23.729
the house is clean?

34:23.762 --> 34:25.231
Yeah.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.599
We will be fine.
The cleanup was flawless.

34:27.633 --> 34:30.902
Stop saying
the house is clean!

34:30.936 --> 34:32.904
It will never be clean,

34:32.938 --> 34:34.573
not to me.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.413
Okay.

34:41.447 --> 34:44.283
Okay. We don't have to
go back there.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.454
Ever.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.423
Thank you.

34:51.457 --> 34:54.793
We have no money, though.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.928
Every penny went into
the house.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.630
So? I'll sell it.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.799
You can't sell it that fast.
Way too suspicious.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.435
Maybe in a year or two.
This is insane.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.737
I know.
No, I mean, I'm not
walking 20 miles.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.273
Well, we have to.
No, we don't.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.775
You're not calling anyone.
Obviously, I am.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.278
I'm calling Christian.

35:18.517 --> 35:21.620
Letty: That house isn't us.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.857
We could never be the people
who live in that house.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.798
I thought we could.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.833
I know.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.136
It was nice.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.505
But three people were
killed in it

35:39.538 --> 35:43.041
within how many days
of you moving in?

35:43.074 --> 35:46.645
Four.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.547
So, yeah,

35:48.580 --> 35:51.250
we're not the people
who live in that house.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.421
Who are we, then?

35:59.090 --> 36:01.760
I think we're hotel people.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.533
Javier:
Look who he brought.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.509
Well, if it isn't Bonnie
and Mexican Clyde.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.177
Thanks for picking us up.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.812
You're lucky we brought
the Sprinter

36:20.846 --> 36:23.014
as opposed to Christian's
Ford Fiesta

36:23.048 --> 36:28.053
or you'd be stuck out here
in East Bumfuck forever. Hop in.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.226
Christian: What are
you guys doing out here?

36:34.260 --> 36:37.028
Javier wanted to go hiking.

36:37.062 --> 36:39.898
Yeah, there were supposed
to be some nice, uh,

36:39.931 --> 36:42.534
waterfalls out here.
Blah, blah, blah.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.337
Look, I don't care what
brought you two out here.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.039
I don't care if you were
burying dead bodies.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.408
I don't give a shit

36:49.441 --> 36:52.378
because I am no longer
Agent Rhonda Lashever.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.045
Well, who are you?

36:54.079 --> 36:56.682
Just Rhonda.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.252
Rhonda Lashever-Woodhill.

37:00.286 --> 37:03.555
-Retired.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.524
Early, thanks to you two.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.892
Congratulations.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.960
-Thanks, dude.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.897
Where to?
Need an address for the Nav.

37:11.930 --> 37:16.568
Uh, the same house I dropped
Letty off at, right?

37:16.602 --> 37:20.572
Actually, we need to stop
somewhere else first.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.974
Here. I'll --
I'll type it in.

37:23.008 --> 37:30.949
**

37:35.153 --> 37:36.755
Christian: "Letty was done
looking over her shoulder.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.224
"All that ugliness and pain
could fade away

37:39.257 --> 37:41.927
into oblivion now."
-Ha!

37:41.960 --> 37:44.963
Barnes & Noble's gonna put it
in the fantasy section.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.967
"It was time to change paths.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.671
"She was going to
settle down, get a job,

37:52.704 --> 37:55.441
"but she had to start
somewhere.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.743
"A sign came into view.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.479
"It said
'East Carolina University.'

38:00.512 --> 38:01.847
"Letty drove through campus,

38:01.880 --> 38:05.250
"eyeing the students
from behind her sunglasses.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.618
"She parked in front

38:06.652 --> 38:08.820
"of the first
brick building she saw.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.924
"Inside, a tiny woman sat
at a large mahogany desk.

38:12.958 --> 38:18.530
'Excuse me,' Letty asked.
'How do I enroll?'"

38:20.799 --> 38:23.068
The end.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.505
You really want my opinion?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.440
Of course, yes.

38:28.474 --> 38:31.577
Letty would never do that.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.647
But it was really good
up until the end.

38:39.518 --> 38:44.122
**

38:48.694 --> 38:51.630
From East Bumfuck
to West Bumfuck.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.900
You two are really
killin' it.
Thanks.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.836
I don't want you to have to
keep picking me up.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.304
Never a problem.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.408
Well, it is, but okay.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.678
I'll call you when I have
an idea for a better ending.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.113
Okay.

39:11.383 --> 39:14.620
**

39:15.587 --> 39:17.389
So where are we?

39:17.423 --> 39:19.024
Our new car.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.860
Called in a favor from
a friend at the scrap yard.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.996
You know, the place where
we burned the Tesla.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.932
Oh. Ricardo.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.101
Good memory.

39:30.135 --> 39:34.440
It's also where you told me
I didn't have a home.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.076
Well, I tried.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.781
You did.

39:52.824 --> 39:56.361
We have to disappear.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.964
Disappearing is expensive.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.369
No. Not that.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.272
Not right now.

40:07.305 --> 40:08.907
What then?

40:14.580 --> 40:17.449
Where did you put
Teo's cocaine?

40:17.483 --> 40:27.559
**

40:27.593 --> 40:29.595
**

40:35.767 --> 40:39.004
I hope that's not where
you put the cocaine.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.906
It's not,
but we should leave.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.675
Why? We're just here
to pick something up

40:43.709 --> 40:45.611
from your storage unit.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.412
What's wrong with that?

40:49.114 --> 40:50.716
Woman: Excuse me.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.753
Can I help you?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.922
We just need to pick something
up from our storage unit,

40:56.955 --> 40:58.123
number 32.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.926
Is everything all right?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.761
What number did you say
yours is again?

41:02.794 --> 41:05.096
32. That one right there.

41:05.130 --> 41:10.435
**

41:10.468 --> 41:12.003
All right, go ahead.

41:12.037 --> 41:14.773
Thank you.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.349
Be right back.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.401
Man: Evenin'.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.904
Oh! Sorry. I...

41:45.937 --> 41:48.239
We're just
picking something up.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.475
You okay?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.711
Yeah. I'm good.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.615
What happened over there?

41:59.184 --> 42:02.020
Husband and wife.
Brutal murder.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.221
Jesus.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.856
You must need something
really bad to hit up

42:04.890 --> 42:07.425
your storage unit
at 3:00 in the morning.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.195
Yeah.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.700
We just finished
building a house.

42:14.733 --> 42:16.334
We're moving in tomorrow.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.738
All of my clothes
are in there, so...

42:20.872 --> 42:22.841
Just couldn't wait
till morning, huh?

42:22.874 --> 42:25.443
We've been staying in
a hotel for two weeks,

42:25.476 --> 42:28.747
but my husband thought it would
be a good idea to go camping

42:28.780 --> 42:32.851
on our last night
as some sort of "thing."

42:32.884 --> 42:36.054
Well, it wasn't a good idea.
It was a shit show.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.956
Where's all your
camping stuff?

42:37.989 --> 42:41.693
Exactly. And I have
no clean clothes left.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.528
So now he's getting
my clothes

42:43.561 --> 42:47.799
so he doesn't have to sleep on
the hotel room floor tonight.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.702
And that's why we're here
at 3:00 in the morning.

42:50.736 --> 42:53.304
Good luck with everything
over there.

42:54.472 --> 43:04.750
**

43:07.919 --> 43:09.320
Two people were killed
in there.

43:09.354 --> 43:13.258
I know. That is how
I paid for your house.

43:22.033 --> 43:25.170
So where do you wanna go?

43:41.787 --> 43:45.456
* I'm not in love

43:45.490 --> 43:48.927
* Don't have the touch

43:48.960 --> 43:51.596
* Don't have the time to bend

43:51.629 --> 43:56.367
* Another little church boy's
mind again *

43:56.401 --> 43:57.936
* Mm, mm, mm

43:57.969 --> 43:59.871
It's so hot here.

43:59.905 --> 44:02.007
* Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm

44:02.040 --> 44:03.809
At least it's a dry heat.

44:03.842 --> 44:06.377
* Mm, mm, mm

44:06.411 --> 44:10.515
How fast do you think
we can sell the cocaine?

44:10.548 --> 44:11.883
In L.A.?

44:11.917 --> 44:13.618
* I'm not the girl you want

44:13.651 --> 44:15.120
Very fast.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.023
* I'm not the debutante

44:18.056 --> 44:21.359
* I'm not a swan,
I'm not a swan *

44:21.392 --> 44:22.894
Plus they have In-N-Out.

44:22.928 --> 44:24.963
* Pretty in a pond

44:24.996 --> 44:28.967
* Mm, mm, mm

44:29.000 --> 44:32.103
* Mm, mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
