00:00.083 --> 00:01.959
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:03.458 --> 00:05.875
I will love her like she is my own.

00:05.959 --> 00:07.917
<i>Lynette made a promise.</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:10.667
His wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead?

00:10.750 --> 00:12.834
I just can't believe
that Orson could do such a thing.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.041
<i>Mike got arrested.</i>

00:14.125 --> 00:15.250
Oh, thank God.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.625
<i>And a friendship hit the rocks.</i>

00:16.709 --> 00:17.959
I'm not playing with a woman

00:18.041 --> 00:20.458
that is willing to let Mike take the fall
for her psycho husband.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.750
<i>Susan made a deal.</i>

00:21.834 --> 00:24.458
I'll hire the best lawyer in town,
on one condition.

00:24.542 --> 00:26.000
You can't see him any more.

00:26.083 --> 00:27.750
<i>And the missing wife returned.</i>

00:27.834 --> 00:29.083
Hello, Alma.

00:33.959 --> 00:36.792
<i>To understand</i>
<i>the journey of Alma Hodge,</i>

00:36.875 --> 00:40.000
<i>you first need to know how it started.</i>

00:41.125 --> 00:44.208
<i>It began the day</i>
<i>she wed Orson Hodge,</i>

00:44.291 --> 00:48.792
<i>a man she had tricked into marriage</i>
<i>by getting pregnant.</i>

00:49.625 --> 00:53.000
<i>Alma was confident</i>
<i>that as their family grew,</i>

00:53.083 --> 00:56.125
<i>Orson's feelings for her</i>
<i>would grow as well.</i>

00:56.959 --> 00:59.208
<i>But then something went wrong,</i>

01:00.166 --> 01:03.583
<i>and the baby she had been</i>
<i>counting on never came.</i>

01:04.875 --> 01:08.458
<i>So Alma found herself</i>
<i>married to a man</i>

01:08.542 --> 01:10.667
<i>who seemed to despise her.</i>

01:12.875 --> 01:15.917
<i>Still, Alma hoped</i>
<i>things would get better.</i>

01:16.959 --> 01:20.458
Mama loves her baby.
Does the baby love Mama?

01:20.542 --> 01:25.500
<i>Until the day she discovered</i>
<i>Orson was having an affair.</i>

01:26.500 --> 01:28.750
<i>And Alma realised the only way</i>

01:28.834 --> 01:32.041
<i>she'd ever get her husband</i>
<i>to appreciate her</i>

01:32.125 --> 01:33.959
<i>was to leave him.</i>

01:34.542 --> 01:36.000
<i>Immediately.</i>

01:46.959 --> 01:49.542
If you don't get
back in your cage right now,

01:49.625 --> 01:52.500
I'm going to have to
leave you behind! Please.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.834
Going somewhere?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.792
I'm staying at a motel tonight.

02:19.417 --> 02:20.500
Why?

02:20.583 --> 02:23.792
I don't have time to discuss it.
I'm late for the bus.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.667
All right.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.083
I'm going away because
I know you're having an affair.

02:40.917 --> 02:42.166
I see.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.583
Aren't you even gonna deny it?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.792
On the contrary,
I want to shout it from the rooftops.

02:49.875 --> 02:53.291
For the first time in my life,
I'm actually in love.

02:53.375 --> 02:56.458
How could you say that to me?
I'm your wife.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.875
We both know why we got married.

02:59.959 --> 03:03.166
And it had nothing to do with affection.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.375
So you don't care if I go?

03:06.667 --> 03:07.792
No.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.875
Wait! This isn't
what's supposed to happen!

03:15.959 --> 03:17.625
You should be begging me
to stay with you.

03:17.709 --> 03:20.625
I deserve to be happy, Alma.
So do you.

03:20.709 --> 03:23.333
And we're clearly
not going to find that together.

03:23.417 --> 03:25.041
Orson, no!

03:26.250 --> 03:29.375
<i>It was at that moment Alma realised</i>

03:29.458 --> 03:32.291
<i>it wasn't enough to leave her husband.</i>

03:33.208 --> 03:35.166
<i>He had to be punished.</i>

03:37.667 --> 03:41.083
<i>Yes, this was</i>
<i>the journey of Alma Hodge.</i>

03:42.750 --> 03:45.333
Bree Hodge? I'm Alma Hodge.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.625
I believe we have someone in common.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.875
<i>And it wasn't over yet.</i>

04:37.500 --> 04:42.291
<i>There is a time of day</i>
<i>all housewives look forward to.</i>

04:42.375 --> 04:46.000
<i>It occurs just after the chores</i>
<i>have been completed</i>

04:46.083 --> 04:49.583
<i>and right before the children</i>
<i>come home from school.</i>

04:51.333 --> 04:54.417
<i>It's a time for good friends</i>
<i>to get together,</i>

04:55.333 --> 04:57.208
<i>have a cup of coffee,</i>

04:57.291 --> 04:59.208
<i>and exchange gossip</i>

04:59.291 --> 05:03.125
<i>about the other good friends</i>
<i>who couldn't make it that day.</i>

05:03.208 --> 05:05.458
Bree let Orson move back in.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.875
- You're kidding. When?
- Yesterday.

05:08.959 --> 05:10.667
I'm so disappointed in her.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.000
Well, the police did arrest Mike.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.542
I mean, I know you think he's innocent,

05:14.625 --> 05:17.333
but surely you can understand
why Bree's feelings have changed.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.917
Well, mine haven't.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.291
And I know something
that Bree probably doesn't.

05:26.458 --> 05:31.083
When Orson was 17,
he spent time in a mental institution.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.041
How did you find that out?

05:33.125 --> 05:36.792
I snuck into his office
and rifled through his things.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.166
Of course you did.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.083
But that doesn't prove he had
anything to do with Monique's murder.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.458
No, but it's a piece of the puzzle.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.709
I mean, he did have an affair with her.

05:45.792 --> 05:49.834
And when you combine that with
the fact that his first wife went missing.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.583
So you're Alma.

05:55.667 --> 05:59.250
- Where have you been all this time?
- In Canada. My aunt lives there.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.208
Well, you should have told someone.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.166
People thought you were dead.

06:03.250 --> 06:06.041
Some even thought
that Orson killed you.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.250
Well, that's sort of what
I wanted them to think.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.083
That's why I left my bird behind
and only took cash,

06:11.166 --> 06:13.291
so they couldn't trace me
through my credit cards.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.417
So you deliberately framed Orson?

06:16.500 --> 06:19.333
I'm not saying it was my finest hour.

06:19.417 --> 06:22.834
But you have to understand,
Orson hurt me very badly.

06:22.917 --> 06:26.709
- He cheated on me.
- Yes, I know, with Monique Polier.

06:26.792 --> 06:29.458
And I thought if I disappeared,

06:29.542 --> 06:33.542
she'd get scared and leave him,
like he left me.

06:33.625 --> 06:35.083
Isn't jealousy awful?

06:35.166 --> 06:36.959
So, why have you come back?

06:37.041 --> 06:39.375
I found this fantastic therapist.

06:39.458 --> 06:42.834
He told me
that by holding on to my anger

06:42.917 --> 06:45.375
I was really just hurting myself,
which was hard to deny.

06:45.458 --> 06:49.750
I mean, hello! I'm here in Winnipeg
with a deaf aunt and no credit!

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
So I thought it's time to make amends.

06:55.041 --> 07:00.792
Darling, Mrs McLean cancelled,
so I'm free for lunch.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.792
Actually, we have a guest.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.125
- Hello, Orson.
- Oh, hello.

07:09.417 --> 07:12.208
So, what is it with you and redheads?

07:18.667 --> 07:21.875
I hope you don't mind me
springing this picnic on you.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.208
I figured it'd be more fun
than some stuffy restaurant.

07:24.291 --> 07:28.291
Are you kidding?
What could be more romantic?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.792
Back off, you son of a bitch!

07:30.875 --> 07:32.583
More wine?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.542
Yes, keep it coming.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.709
Hello?

07:36.792 --> 07:39.583
<i>- Hey, hey! Who's the dork?</i>
- Carlos?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.000
<i>What's with that cap?</i>

07:41.083 --> 07:44.166
<i>Extra, extra, read all about it!</i>

07:44.250 --> 07:46.125
Where the hell are you?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.750
- What are you doing in Mike's house?
<i>- I live here.</i>

07:55.834 --> 07:57.542
What do you mean you live there?
Since when?

07:57.625 --> 07:59.709
Gabby, my car's been in the driveway
for three weeks.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.125
Even you can't be that self-absorbed.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.417
Well, as you can see,

08:05.500 --> 08:08.166
I have more pleasant things
to focus on.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.917
So when are you gonna tell
Jimmy Olsen there

08:11.000 --> 08:12.625
that you hate picnics?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.667
I'm gonna hang up now.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.875
So, where were we?

08:17.959 --> 08:21.583
Your ex-husband
moved in across the street?

08:22.792 --> 08:24.959
What's that gonna be like?

08:26.291 --> 08:28.875
- Yeah?
- Are you gonna kiss him?

08:28.959 --> 08:30.250
That's right, Carlos.

08:30.333 --> 08:35.000
We have had some problems
with raccoons getting into the trash.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.834
So why don't you just put a lid on it?

08:44.083 --> 08:46.166
Okay, they're here.
Now, listen, stand up.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.583
Kayla has been through a lot.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.000
So when she walks in the door

08:49.083 --> 08:50.542
I want you to
make her feel welcome, okay?

08:50.625 --> 08:52.667
Give her a hug and be really nice.

08:52.750 --> 08:56.041
I'm giving her my room.
How much nicer do I have to be?

08:56.125 --> 08:58.583
Well, nicer than that,
or she's gonna get all your toys, too.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.792
Okay.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.625
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey!

09:01.709 --> 09:04.333
Look who I found
wandering around the airport.

09:04.417 --> 09:08.291
Hi, Kayla! We missed you!
We're so glad you're here.

09:12.542 --> 09:13.959
Okay, boys.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.792
Good. Yeah.
Okay, so, give her some room.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.625
Hey, wow, look,
are those presents for Kayla?

09:27.709 --> 09:29.375
Yes, they are.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.125
Hey, look at that.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.417
Preston gave you a harmonica.
Isn't that cool?

09:33.500 --> 09:36.667
Oh, <i>Harriet the Spy.</i>
Sounds mysterious.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.041
Thanks.

09:41.959 --> 09:45.208
- And what did you get for her, Porter?
- A video game.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.792
But I get to play it whenever I want.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.083
Porter!

09:52.125 --> 09:55.041
You know what,
I got you something, too.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.959
This is Nellie.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.542
My grandma gave her to me
when I was little,

10:02.625 --> 10:06.458
and I was hoping
you could take care of her for me.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.583
Thanks.

10:12.166 --> 10:15.041
Hey, honey, why don't you
take your stuff and go upstairs

10:15.125 --> 10:17.750
and then get ready for lunch, okay?
I'm gonna make some chilli.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.709
- Okay, Daddy.
- Okay, baby.

10:22.667 --> 10:27.500
Honey, that was so sweet
to give her your doll.

10:27.959 --> 10:30.417
Well, she didn't seem
that knocked out by it.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.625
Well, just give her some time.
She'll come around.

10:33.709 --> 10:36.125
- It's a tough adjustment.
- Okay.

10:47.083 --> 10:51.583
I must say, Bree, I don't know when
I've tasted such moist pound cake.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.792
Sour cream.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.083
So, whatever happened to my parrot?

11:04.959 --> 11:06.542
I set it free.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.333
Orson, they don't fare well in the wild.
You should have...

11:10.417 --> 11:13.750
For God's sake, Alma,
who cares about the damn bird.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.417
You set me up!

11:16.542 --> 11:21.000
Why don't I wrap up a piece of this
pound cake for you to enjoy later?

11:22.875 --> 11:25.166
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

11:25.250 --> 11:26.625
You almost ruined my life.

11:26.709 --> 11:29.208
You've rebounded nicely. Bree's lovely.

11:29.291 --> 11:30.625
Don't change the subject.

11:30.709 --> 11:34.667
You put me through a lot too, Orson.
But I forgave you.

11:34.750 --> 11:37.000
Can't we just put this behind us?

11:37.083 --> 11:39.875
And that's all you've come back for?
Closure?

11:39.959 --> 11:42.083
Of course. What else?

11:45.709 --> 11:48.959
- I'm out of lipstick. Can I borrow yours?
- Sure.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.834
- Cherry Berry?
- Austin likes the way it tastes.

11:53.917 --> 11:56.834
Oh, I so did not need to know that.

11:56.917 --> 12:01.083
- So, where are you going?
- Down to the jailhouse to talk to Mike.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.291
But didn't you tell Ian
you wouldn't see him any more?

12:04.375 --> 12:07.500
Yeah, but somebody's got to tell him
about his new lawyer.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.458
Otherwise the guy's gonna show up
and he's gonna go,

12:09.542 --> 12:12.166
"Who the hell is he?" Ian gets that.

12:13.792 --> 12:17.542
Besides, why would it be a big deal?
Mike and I are over.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.000
I was just wondering 'cause,

12:21.083 --> 12:24.208
you know, you're putting on lipstick
to go to a prison.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.041
Thank you for clearing things up.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.875
Oh, well, it was the least I could do.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.333
Orson, I'm truly sorry for the pain
I've caused.

12:37.417 --> 12:40.291
And if there's anything else I can do...

12:42.542 --> 12:44.041
Actually, there is.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.834
I'd love it if you could join us
for dinner this weekend.

12:46.917 --> 12:51.959
There are some friends
that I'm just dying for you to meet.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.333
Hey, how you doing?

13:00.542 --> 13:03.792
- You got me a lawyer?
- Yeah, and he is fantastic.

13:03.875 --> 13:07.166
You cannot believe
the scum he has gotten off.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.083
Not that you're scum.

13:10.166 --> 13:13.041
But, you know, if you were,
you'd be sitting pretty.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.458
I'm paying you back every penny.

13:15.542 --> 13:18.667
Oh, well, you know,
we'll figure that out later.

13:18.750 --> 13:23.041
I can't believe I just listened
to all that stuff Edie told me about you.

13:23.125 --> 13:26.417
And it turns out
you're the only one standing by me.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.417
You're a good friend, Susan.

13:33.375 --> 13:35.041
Yeah, about that.

13:35.875 --> 13:37.166
It's Ian.

13:37.250 --> 13:41.083
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

13:41.166 --> 13:44.166
Even an ex who
doesn't remember dating you?

13:46.250 --> 13:49.417
I remember,
and I guess that's enough for him.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.667
I'm sorry.

13:55.291 --> 13:58.625
Well, I can't say that I blame him.

14:04.417 --> 14:07.625
- Take care of yourself, Mike.
- You, too, Susan.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.709
Dinner's ready.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.875
Kayla, I made your favourite, tacos.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.709
Here you go.

14:30.792 --> 14:32.000
Where's my daddy?

14:32.083 --> 14:34.125
Oh, sorry, sweetheart,
he's working late,

14:34.208 --> 14:37.000
trying to get the restaurant ready.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.250
Oh, lovely, Parker.
Go wash your hands. Go on.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.667
- Kayla, where are you going?
- To watch TV.

14:45.917 --> 14:48.166
Oh, sweetie, we don't watch TV
during dinner.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.875
But my show is on.

14:49.959 --> 14:52.709
Well, I'm sorry, those are the rules.

14:53.291 --> 14:55.041
My mommy let me.

14:55.792 --> 14:57.041
Well...

14:59.959 --> 15:01.750
Just this once.

15:09.834 --> 15:12.875
Okay, okay,
I know what you're thinking,

15:12.959 --> 15:15.667
but Kayla's going through a hard time
right now. Come and sit down.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.500
Letting her watch TV

15:17.583 --> 15:21.250
is like me letting you eat ice cream
when you're sick.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.875
But she's not sick.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.709
Well, that's true, but she's sad.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.875
I'm sad I can't watch TV.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.083
Eat your tacos.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.792
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sit your butts down.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.291
It's not fair!

15:43.375 --> 15:45.834
I don't care. We have rules.

15:45.917 --> 15:47.834
- Well, she gets to.
- She is special.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.000
Now, sit down. Come on.

15:53.208 --> 15:56.208
- Does she get dessert, too?
- Of course I do.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.959
What an amazing documentary, huh?

16:05.041 --> 16:08.041
You know, I read the director
shot over 400 hours of film.

16:08.125 --> 16:10.667
Really? I only counted half that.

16:11.750 --> 16:15.041
- I get it. You pick the next one.
- Okay.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.875
Look at you!

16:19.959 --> 16:23.083
Who knew you were such a romantic?

16:23.166 --> 16:25.875
Actually, I didn't send them.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.208
You didn't?

16:32.875 --> 16:35.667
So, who's making me look bad?

16:36.959 --> 16:38.875
There's no signature.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.542
- I'm sorry. This is kind of awkward.
- No, hey, it's...

16:43.625 --> 16:46.458
I don't care
who worships you from afar,

16:48.125 --> 16:50.750
as long as I get to do it up close.

16:51.166 --> 16:55.291
Oh. That's sweet
that you're not jealous.

16:56.959 --> 17:00.500
Carlos would have hit the roof
if some guy sent me...

17:05.834 --> 17:08.166
Would you excuse me a minute?

17:17.917 --> 17:20.083
- Nice try, Carlos.
- Huh?

17:20.166 --> 17:23.917
Oh, don't act innocent.
You know you sent me these flowers.

17:25.500 --> 17:29.625
- Why would I get you flowers?
- To sabotage my new relationship.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.917
Oh, with Picnic Boy?
What do I care if you go out with him?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.291
Oh, you care.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.917
First you move across the street,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.083
and then, earlier today,
I catch you spying on me.

17:39.166 --> 17:42.333
I was not spying. I was mocking you.

17:42.417 --> 17:45.208
- You need to move on, Carlos.
- I have moved on.

17:45.291 --> 17:48.083
You're the one talking to your ex
during the middle of a date.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.125
- Is he that boring?
- Bill is not boring.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.792
He is vibrant.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.583
And sexy.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.125
And yet, here you are.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.458
She threw your doll in the trash?

18:30.542 --> 18:34.792
No, first she ripped off its arms,
stuffed it with chilli,

18:34.875 --> 18:37.500
then she threw it in the trash.

18:37.583 --> 18:41.041
- So what did you do?
- Nothing.

18:42.125 --> 18:45.083
And this is after
you let her watch TV during dinner?

18:45.166 --> 18:47.917
Well, I didn't know what else to do.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.375
I'm trying to win over a little girl
who clearly doesn't want a new mother.

18:52.458 --> 18:56.500
Well, I guess giving her special
treatment isn't going to solve anything.

18:56.583 --> 19:00.417
You know what might solve something?

19:01.959 --> 19:05.166
If you were home once in a while.
You're the one she listens to.

19:05.250 --> 19:09.458
I am trying to open up a restaurant.
Our life savings is riding on this thing.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.291
I know. I know. I know.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.500
You know what?

19:12.583 --> 19:16.208
I don't want you to be afraid
to take a firm hand with Kayla.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.458
She's part of our family now.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.792
You know what that means.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.583
Yeah.

19:23.667 --> 19:27.250
I should treat her as badly
as I treat my own children.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.667
Exactly.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.834
Sorry.

19:43.083 --> 19:46.417
I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.125
That's cool.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.750
You can't blame me for trying, though.

19:53.375 --> 19:56.500
Austin, you know I want to, it's just...

19:56.583 --> 19:58.750
Hey, don't sweat it.

19:58.834 --> 20:01.625
If you're not ready, you're not ready.

20:06.542 --> 20:10.083
So, he didn't pressure you at all?
What a great guy.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.500
I know. I'm so lucky.

20:11.583 --> 20:15.875
Underneath all that "bad boy" posturing
he's a real gentleman.

20:15.959 --> 20:19.625
Wow. You're not only a virgin,
you think like one.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.625
Beat it, eavesdropper!

20:22.542 --> 20:23.917
No, wait.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.834
What did you mean by that?

20:25.917 --> 20:30.667
Well, guys need sex.
All right? It's basic science.

20:30.750 --> 20:34.834
So if he's not getting it from you,
he'll end up getting it somewhere else.

20:34.917 --> 20:38.250
You're a moron.
Not all guys pressure girls for sex.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.750
Yeah, gay guys don't.
But Austin's not gay.

20:41.834 --> 20:44.041
Not even after three beers.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.125
Don't ask.

20:48.417 --> 20:50.583
So, what's your point?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
If a guy has to wait too long
to see you naked,

20:55.083 --> 20:57.625
he'll end up seeing you as a friend.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.583
Again, science.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.166
Don't listen to him.
You hold on to your virginity.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.250
If Austin won't wait,
then he doesn't deserve you.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.041
I just don't want to lose him.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.959
It's better than losing your self-respect.

21:12.041 --> 21:16.375
Take it from a girl who's known at
school as "Little Miss Van De Tramp."

21:16.458 --> 21:17.917
I thought you made that up.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.709
Only 'cause it was nicer
than the other names

21:19.792 --> 21:21.500
they were calling me.

21:28.917 --> 21:31.166
I really appreciate
you donating this stuff.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.959
Anything for a good cause.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.792
Everyone at the shelter's
gonna be so excited.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.417
To you and me,
these are just a bunch of old clothes.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.041
But to a homeless woman,

21:41.125 --> 21:43.917
it's a chance
for her to feel pretty again.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.417
You okay?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.458
- What?
- I asked if you're okay.

21:48.542 --> 21:50.792
You seem kind of distracted.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.333
I am fine.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.333
Yes. I just remembered,
today's my mother's birthday.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.875
Can we stop by the florist
on the way to the shelter?

21:59.959 --> 22:01.250
Yeah.

22:04.792 --> 22:07.000
Detective Ridley?
My name is Susan Mayer,

22:07.083 --> 22:10.792
and I'm calling to
"drop a dime" on someone.

22:10.875 --> 22:12.709
That's the expression, right?

22:12.792 --> 22:15.625
Yes, ma'am.
You've got the lingo down pat.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.875
<i>Good.</i>

22:17.709 --> 22:19.917
His name is Orson Hodge,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.875
and he had an affair with the woman
that you think Mike Delfino killed.

22:23.959 --> 22:25.667
Monique Polier?

22:25.750 --> 22:29.125
Are you sure? Because Mr Hodge
saw her body in the morgue.

22:29.208 --> 22:31.834
- He acted like he didn't know her.
- Well, he does.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.917
And so he's pretending he didn't.
That's suspicious, right?

22:35.000 --> 22:36.291
Well...

22:36.875 --> 22:38.834
Oh, can you hold on?

22:39.542 --> 22:42.125
- Hello?
- Susan, hi, it's Bree.

22:42.208 --> 22:44.542
Bree! Hi.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.417
Can you hold on a second?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.291
It's Orson's wife!
She can't know I called you.

22:50.375 --> 22:53.875
- Then how about you don't tell her?
- Right. Sorry.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.667
I'm just new to this whole snitch thing.
Hold on, okay?

22:59.667 --> 23:03.709
Bree, hi. Sorry about that.
Damn telemarketer.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.709
<i>So, what can I do for you?</i>

23:05.792 --> 23:10.625
I just feel really awful about our fight,
and I think it's time for an apology.

23:10.709 --> 23:13.125
Oh, Bree.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.542
I am so relieved.

23:15.625 --> 23:18.959
Would you join Orson and me
for dinner tomorrow night?

23:19.041 --> 23:20.250
Oh.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.291
Sure.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.000
Good, I'll see you at 8:00.

23:25.083 --> 23:29.625
Bree, I just want you to know that,
no matter what,

23:29.709 --> 23:31.959
your friendship means the world to me.

23:32.041 --> 23:35.375
<i>Oh Susan, you know I feel</i>
<i>exactly the same...</i>

23:35.458 --> 23:36.750
It's me again.

23:36.834 --> 23:40.041
You should also know
that Orson spent a year in an asylum.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.041
Hi. Can I help you?

23:47.125 --> 23:50.000
Hi, I received some flowers
from your shop yesterday

23:50.083 --> 23:52.333
and the card didn't say
who they were from.

23:52.417 --> 23:56.792
- Can you check? The name is Solis.
- Sure. Sure. Just give me a sec here.

23:58.083 --> 23:59.917
- Solis?
- Yeah.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.625
Solis, Solis.

24:04.458 --> 24:05.917
This is odd.

24:06.625 --> 24:08.792
The buyer asked
to remain anonymous.

24:08.875 --> 24:10.458
Really?

24:10.542 --> 24:14.875
Well, the flowers were so beautiful,
I'd like to know who to thank.

24:14.959 --> 24:17.375
Sorry. I have to honour their request.

24:17.458 --> 24:21.542
Why? They're just flowers.
They're not government secrets.

24:21.625 --> 24:26.000
- If you don't mind, I'm busy.
- Okay, wait, wait. Let me explain.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.750
What's to explain?
A pretty girl gets flowers.

24:29.834 --> 24:32.000
Do you know how many girls
never get flowers?

24:32.083 --> 24:35.875
I work in a flower shop.
I've never gotten any freaking flowers.

24:35.959 --> 24:38.166
So stop your whining
about who sent them

24:38.250 --> 24:40.333
and just be glad he did!

24:48.417 --> 24:52.750
You're right. And I am so sorry
for taking up so much of your time.

24:53.709 --> 24:56.417
- Sorry for doing this!
- Hey!

24:56.500 --> 24:59.917
What the hell are you doing?
Hey! Hey! Hey!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.792
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?

25:01.875 --> 25:04.500
Once I'm done, I'll send you flowers.

25:12.792 --> 25:16.750
Hey! You won't get away with this!
I know where you live!

25:16.834 --> 25:19.458
Yeah? Well, stop by, we'll hot tub.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.917
Hey, mister! Help!

25:24.000 --> 25:26.125
She locked me in here!

25:26.834 --> 25:28.166
Gabby?

25:29.083 --> 25:30.750
This is totally her fault.

25:30.834 --> 25:33.875
I mean, I simply asked her
if Carlos sent me the flowers,

25:33.959 --> 25:35.875
and she refused
to show me the order slip.

25:35.959 --> 25:37.917
Are you still hung up on that?

25:38.000 --> 25:39.792
- For God's sake.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait!

25:39.875 --> 25:42.166
I just need a couple more minutes.
I need to know the truth!

25:42.250 --> 25:43.750
What truth is that, huh?

25:43.834 --> 25:46.333
That you're still obsessed
with your ex-husband?

25:46.417 --> 25:49.667
What? No! He's obsessed with me!

25:49.750 --> 25:53.834
You just imprisoned a florist
to find out if he sent you roses.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.917
Okay, I see what you mean.

26:02.542 --> 26:05.583
There. I'm done. Let's go.

26:05.667 --> 26:09.417
Actually, I think I'm done, too.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.125
I'm sorry.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.959
It's okay.
I'm probably not ready to date.

26:36.834 --> 26:38.208
Thanks.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.583
And just so you know,
I am ready to date.

26:44.667 --> 26:46.709
All right, let's hit it.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.750
- Come on, Kayla.
- I haven't finished my ice cream.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.792
Well, I'm sorry, but we gotta go.
I have a dinner party I have to get to.

26:54.875 --> 26:57.500
They got to finish their ice cream.

26:58.125 --> 27:01.750
Well, they, you know, wolfed it down
like kids are supposed to.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.583
So, hurry it up.

27:11.208 --> 27:14.500
Kayla, I'm not fooling around.
We're going.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.417
Okay.

27:20.041 --> 27:23.333
Boys, go to the car.
I'll be out in a minute. Go.

27:29.709 --> 27:32.875
Listen, sweetheart,
I don't blame you for being angry.

27:32.959 --> 27:36.458
Your mom's gone
and you're stuck with me.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.625
But...

27:44.834 --> 27:48.875
The last thing she said to me was,
"Promise you'll take care of Kayla."

27:48.959 --> 27:50.750
And I am going to.

27:51.834 --> 27:54.583
But you're gonna
have to help me, okay?

27:57.458 --> 27:59.667
We can leave when I'm done.

28:08.125 --> 28:09.750
Okay, let's go.

28:10.709 --> 28:13.834
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. What the hell are you doing?

28:13.917 --> 28:16.458
- Stop, stop! Stop screaming, stop!
- Leave me alone!

28:16.542 --> 28:19.166
You're not my mommy!

28:47.959 --> 28:50.709
Guys, how would you like to eat dinner
in front of the television

28:50.792 --> 28:52.709
for a whole week?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.291
What are you guys doing here?

29:06.458 --> 29:09.291
Kayla, stop screaming,
you're hurting my ears!

29:09.375 --> 29:11.208
Just get in the car!

29:12.125 --> 29:14.291
Come on, we're going home!

29:14.875 --> 29:16.542
Get your seat belt on!

29:16.625 --> 29:19.166
Kids, they're always roughhousing.

29:41.834 --> 29:43.583
Why did you stop?

29:44.166 --> 29:48.000
Well, it's getting late,
I got your blouse unbuttoned.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.959
That's usually when we call it a night.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.792
Do you want to call it a night?

29:54.625 --> 29:57.834
What, do you want to grab a pizza
or something?

30:05.291 --> 30:07.834
I want to do what you want to do.

30:09.709 --> 30:12.250
Well, you know what I want to do.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.041
Well, okay.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.542
Are you sure?

30:19.834 --> 30:21.458
Yeah, I'm sure.

30:41.875 --> 30:46.542
You can always spot the new guys
by the way they pick through their food.

30:48.500 --> 30:52.125
So, what did you do
when you thought no one was looking?

30:52.208 --> 30:54.250
The cops say I killed a woman.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.291
But you didn't, right?

30:57.542 --> 30:59.959
Actually, I have no idea.

31:01.709 --> 31:04.417
I got pretty banged up in an accident.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.041
The last two years are a blank.

31:07.458 --> 31:10.000
Well, that's a fresh approach.

31:11.166 --> 31:13.125
Not sure the jury's gonna swallow it.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.875
It's the truth.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.166
I believe you.

31:22.917 --> 31:25.458
Okay, Mrs McCluskey's downstairs

31:25.542 --> 31:28.166
and we will be right across the street
if you need us.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.750
Okay, Daddy.

31:31.542 --> 31:34.542
You know, I heard
what happened with Lynette today.

31:35.959 --> 31:39.458
Hey, she's doing her best.
Why are you being so hard on her?

31:39.542 --> 31:41.959
Because it's her fault my mommy died.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.875
No. No, no, honey, it's not.

31:43.959 --> 31:47.291
Mom only went to that store
because Lynette was trying to steal me.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.458
Okay, that is not true.

31:49.542 --> 31:53.125
Look, honey,
it is way more complicated than that.

31:55.208 --> 31:58.959
I know you miss your mommy,
and she loved you very much.

31:59.875 --> 32:01.458
But guess what?

32:02.500 --> 32:04.542
Lynette loves you, too.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.834
That's why you gotta
give her a chance.

32:09.291 --> 32:11.333
Can you do that for me?

32:13.542 --> 32:15.834
Okay. I'll be good.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.542
That's my girl.

32:18.792 --> 32:21.125
But I'm never gonna love her.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.333
And you can't make me.

32:38.834 --> 32:40.792
Well, you've won.

32:40.875 --> 32:42.542
What did I win?

32:46.291 --> 32:48.375
Bill and I split up.

32:48.458 --> 32:52.625
Can't say I'm surprised.
He wasn't right for you.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.166
I know.

32:54.792 --> 32:57.458
So, just admit you sent the flowers.

32:58.417 --> 32:59.792
I didn't.

33:00.250 --> 33:04.458
Carlos, just tell me.
I won't be mad. I promise.

33:05.709 --> 33:07.333
Gabby, if I was
gonna send you flowers,

33:07.417 --> 33:10.000
I wouldn't send you pink roses.

33:10.083 --> 33:14.250
I'd send you white orchids
because I know they're your favourite.

33:15.375 --> 33:18.792
And if I wanted to cheer you up,
sunflowers.

33:18.875 --> 33:23.125
And for the flu, blue irises.

33:36.083 --> 33:40.041
I hate that you know me so well,
and it took so long for that to happen.

33:40.125 --> 33:43.208
Now I have to start over again
with somebody else.

33:43.291 --> 33:46.083
Yeah. That's what dating is for.

33:46.166 --> 33:48.208
I know, and it sucks.

33:49.166 --> 33:52.000
I mean, you saw me. I went on a picnic
and ate pudding out of a can!

33:52.083 --> 33:53.792
It was horrible!

33:55.417 --> 33:57.500
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

33:57.583 --> 34:00.250
I got dragged to the ballet
the other night.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.417
So, you are dating.

34:04.875 --> 34:07.667
That's why you've been
lifting weights and jogging.

34:07.750 --> 34:12.542
Well, if you wanna bag the big game,
you gotta work on the guns.

34:18.166 --> 34:20.083
I'll give you this.

34:21.250 --> 34:24.417
You're gonna be
a tough act to follow, Carlos.

34:29.792 --> 34:31.542
Back at you, babe.

34:48.959 --> 34:50.750
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,

34:50.834 --> 34:53.917
but I don't want to introduce you
until all my guests are here.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.542
I don't mind.

34:56.166 --> 34:57.625
By the way,

34:58.458 --> 35:00.709
when my friends ask you
what happened,

35:00.792 --> 35:02.542
and they will,

35:02.625 --> 35:06.125
I don't think it's necessary
to go into all that unpleasantness

35:06.208 --> 35:08.291
about Orson and Monique.

35:08.375 --> 35:12.083
All they need to know is that
you're back and we're on good terms.

35:12.166 --> 35:14.291
And Orson didn't kill me.

35:15.083 --> 35:17.250
And Orson didn't kill you.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.208
Okay, just one minute, that'll be Susan.

35:44.792 --> 35:47.083
Hi. I brought you a Bundt cake.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.208
- Don't worry, I didn't make it.
- Oh, you didn't have to do that.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.166
I was really touched by your call.
It was so big of you.

35:53.250 --> 35:56.041
Well, when you're wrong, you're wrong.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.792
Now that we're all assembled,

36:00.875 --> 36:03.375
I'd like to introduce
the guest of honour.

36:03.458 --> 36:07.500
I hope you'll all be
as delighted to meet her as I was.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.458
You can come in now.

36:13.625 --> 36:17.667
Everyone, this is Alma Hodge,
Orson's first wife.

36:22.542 --> 36:26.041
Oh, about that apology,
anytime you're ready.

36:28.959 --> 36:32.000
So, you have been in Canada
this entire time?

36:32.083 --> 36:34.333
Well, my Aunt Agnes
has a place in Winnipeg.

36:34.417 --> 36:38.417
I hadn't planned on staying so long,
but I needed the time to find myself.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.750
Would've been nice
if someone else could've found you.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.417
There was a whole lot of drama
around here.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.583
Yes, I heard.

36:43.667 --> 36:47.667
People actually thought
Orson had done away with me?

36:47.750 --> 36:51.291
Amazing, isn't it,
where some people's minds will go?

36:54.458 --> 36:56.542
Well, you gotta hand it to her.

36:56.625 --> 36:57.750
Just when you think Bree's thrown

36:57.834 --> 36:59.917
every conceivable theme party,
she hosts a

37:00.000 --> 37:02.917
shame-on-you-for-thinking-
my-husband-killed-someone dinner.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.709
So Alma's alive. Big deal.

37:04.792 --> 37:07.125
We still don't know what went down
between Orson and Monique.

37:07.208 --> 37:11.417
Susan, please. We look stupid enough
for suspecting him. Just let it go.

37:15.458 --> 37:18.333
It may be a little late for that.

37:18.417 --> 37:22.792
- Detective Ridley. Can I help you?
- Yes, I'd like to speak to your husband.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.250
Oh, well, I'm afraid he's not here,

37:26.333 --> 37:28.959
but I will be happy to tell him
that you came by.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.875
Who is it, darling?

37:34.917 --> 37:36.291
Excuse us.

37:39.041 --> 37:42.125
Can't this wait?
We're having a dinner party.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.125
- Hello, Dr Hodge.
- Detective Ridley.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.458
We need you to come with us.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.166
We have some questions
about that Jane Doe

37:49.250 --> 37:50.834
we showed you in the morgue.

37:50.917 --> 37:53.542
Why do you think
I'd know anything about her?

37:53.625 --> 37:57.208
Well, you were having
an affair with her when she died.

37:58.750 --> 38:01.083
Well, where did you hear that?

38:05.291 --> 38:06.625
Susan.

38:08.125 --> 38:11.166
I didn't know
they were gonna come tonight.

38:12.500 --> 38:16.166
Well, I'm happy to answer
any questions that you might have.

38:16.250 --> 38:19.583
My apologies.
Please, stay, enjoy the dessert.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.375
I don't believe this.

38:25.458 --> 38:28.792
- You called the police?
- Well, obviously you weren't going to.

38:28.875 --> 38:31.750
They needed to know that that
dead woman was Orson's mistress.

38:31.834 --> 38:33.917
I told you that in confidence.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.208
Did you seriously think I could sit on
information that would exonerate Mike?

38:38.291 --> 38:41.166
If you had seen his face in jail
the other day...

38:41.250 --> 38:44.875
- The other day? You saw Mike?
- Yeah.

38:44.959 --> 38:47.792
Just to tell him about the lawyer.

38:47.875 --> 38:50.333
- I know that Mike is innocent.
- Right.

38:50.417 --> 38:52.875
Just like you knew she was dead.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.166
- I thought we had an agreement.
- We do.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.333
- Can we talk about this later?
- When?

38:59.417 --> 39:02.041
After your next conjugal visit?

39:02.125 --> 39:03.583
Ian, wait!

39:03.667 --> 39:07.125
Boy, when it comes to Mike,
there's no one you won't betray.

39:07.208 --> 39:09.834
- Excuse me?
- Hey, guys.

39:09.917 --> 39:12.125
- Please leave my house.
- Bree!

39:12.208 --> 39:14.250
You heard me. Get out!

39:14.333 --> 39:17.166
Okay, Bree, I know you're angry,
but for the sake of our friendship...

39:17.250 --> 39:20.583
Oh, make no mistake,
our friendship is over.

39:27.291 --> 39:29.792
- Okay, you go...
- Okay.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.667
So, Winnipeg.

39:40.041 --> 39:42.542
It must get pretty cold up there.

39:48.542 --> 39:50.166
I'm just getting my coat.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.333
Ian, please,
I just lost one of my best friends.

39:52.417 --> 39:53.542
I can't lose you, too.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.542
You said that
you wouldn't see him again!

39:55.625 --> 39:58.041
But you had to know
that I would go one more time

39:58.125 --> 39:59.500
to just explain everything.

39:59.583 --> 40:02.375
- Actually, no, I didn't.
- Well, that's just crazy.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.375
Why are you acting
like a crazy person?

40:04.458 --> 40:07.333
Because you've already
left me once for this guy!

40:07.417 --> 40:09.792
Things are different now! I love you!

40:09.875 --> 40:12.500
You don't have to
worry about that any more.

40:12.583 --> 40:14.208
God, if we're gonna make
this relationship work,

40:14.291 --> 40:16.583
then you have to trust me.

40:16.667 --> 40:19.959
- Why are you smiling at me?
- You just said that you love me.

40:20.041 --> 40:22.834
- Yeah. So?
- Well, you've never said that before.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.667
- Yes, I have.
- No, I would've remembered.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.792
Well, I'm saying it now. I love you.
Do you have a problem with that?

40:28.875 --> 40:31.667
- No, ma'am.
- You can't kiss me now.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.667
- I'm yelling at you.
- Well, I'm listening.

40:33.750 --> 40:38.583
Well, don't think that you can
get out of this, you know, by just...

40:38.667 --> 40:42.291
Oh, God. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, right there.

40:42.375 --> 40:43.709
Oh, right there.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.500
Look, I think we should stop doing this.

40:52.417 --> 40:56.333
I know it's my idea,
but it just doesn't feel right any more.

40:57.959 --> 41:00.709
So you slept with Julie. It's no big deal.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.709
Well, it is to her
and I don't wanna see her get hurt.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.166
Me, either.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.709
So let's just not tell her.

41:15.125 --> 41:18.125
There's no place in Fairview
that's more peaceful.

41:18.208 --> 41:20.083
All the floors are hardwood.

41:20.166 --> 41:22.458
Oh, there are brand new appliances.

41:22.542 --> 41:25.667
And the gardens are,
well, they're beautiful.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.917
So, what do you think?

41:31.917 --> 41:33.333
I'll take it.

41:33.417 --> 41:36.166
Really? Oh, that's terrific.

41:36.250 --> 41:39.125
I'll draw up the papers in the morning.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.041
If you don't mind me asking,

41:45.125 --> 41:48.583
why were you so interested
in this particular street?

41:48.667 --> 41:51.667
I've been moving around a lot
in the last few months.

41:51.750 --> 41:54.333
And I need a place
where I can really settle down.

41:54.417 --> 41:56.166
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

41:56.959 --> 42:00.542
<i>I want to live in a place</i>
<i>where children know how to behave,</i>

42:00.625 --> 42:04.208
<i>where people still have</i>
<i>some sense of moral value,</i>

42:04.291 --> 42:10.208
<i>and where friendships are good</i>
<i>and strong and last forever.</i>

42:12.000 --> 42:14.291
That's what I'm looking for.

42:14.667 --> 42:18.208
Then I think Wisteria Lane
is the place for you.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.500
Good.

42:20.542 --> 42:23.542
More than anything, I just want to fit in.

42:25.375 --> 42:27.458
<i>Oh, you will, Alma.</i>

42:27.542 --> 42:29.750
<i>You absolutely will.</i>
