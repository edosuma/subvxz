00:38.413 --> 00:39.998
C'mon!

02:01.330 --> 02:05.125
We haven't got time for that.
C'mon, c'mon!

04:09.958 --> 04:13.921
Run, head to the river!

04:43.158 --> 04:44.910
Get on, c'mon!

04:47.579 --> 04:49.039
Watch out.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.737
You got the ring?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.322
What ring?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.074
The ring!

05:47.139 --> 05:48.724
Dearly beloved,

05:49.266 --> 05:52.561
We gathered here today, to 
celebrate the marriage of...

05:52.561 --> 05:56.690
Carl Brackston to Tilly Ammeson.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.902
If anyone here, should know 
of any impediment ...

05:59.902 --> 06:03.989
why these two should not be joined
in holy wedlock...

06:03.989 --> 06:08.744
let them speak now, or forever
hold their peace.

06:08.744 --> 06:09.745
Carl.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.372
Would thy have this woman, 
thy I wedded wife,

06:12.372 --> 06:17.753
to live together after god ordernents,
in the holiest day to man?

06:17.753 --> 06:22.216
Would I love her,  comfort her, 
honour and keep her...

06:22.216 --> 06:23.383
What is it?

06:23.383 --> 06:26.178
Brackston and Davidson, 
report to G-6 immediately.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.846
Urgent!

06:27.846 --> 06:30.349
We're standing at the altar.

06:30.349 --> 06:31.433
- The altar?
- I will.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.851
I repeat Agent Davidsone.

06:32.851 --> 06:33.810
Immediately!

06:33.810 --> 06:35.771
We got triple red alert!

06:35.771 --> 06:38.982
...okay.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.109
You don't pay me enough for this.

06:41.109 --> 06:46.406
Keep him in sickness and in health...

06:46.406 --> 06:49.076
Excuse me, vicar.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.829
Red alert Carl, we got to get now.
Sorry buddy.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.664
What?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.875
Look honey I got to go, I'm sorry.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.043
Where is he going...?

06:58.126 --> 07:01.088
Carl, you can't go now
We make great bonds.

07:01.088 --> 07:06.718
I know you don't meant it honey,
I love you, bye.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.558
Okay, let's go.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.230
Okay, Carl...

07:18.230 --> 07:21.024
Tell me what you know about,
Colonol Scarf Mulgrew...

07:21.024 --> 07:23.569
Scarf Mulgrew is an ex-British
policeman who was...

07:23.569 --> 07:28.740
jailed by the British, by killing
several men under interrogation.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.494
He's mad, he's a sadist,
he hates the British.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.996
And most of all,

07:33.996 --> 07:35.998
he hates Americans.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.208
Correct.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.043
And this is him.

07:40.043 --> 07:44.214
Now we know for months that, Mulgrew
has been helping Sheik Ali Maksood...

07:44.214 --> 07:48.427
To train their assassins in at old 
British fort, up in the mountains.

07:48.427 --> 07:55.893
And probably paying him several
many years for his favours.

07:55.893 --> 07:59.313
But lately, things got much worst.

07:59.313 --> 08:03.483
Its been confirmed that, those bastards
on the verge of creating a nuclear device

08:03.483 --> 08:05.903
small enough to fit into a suitcase...

08:05.903 --> 08:07.571
to carry it to New York.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.114
Holy shit!

08:09.114 --> 08:11.033
My sentiment, exactly.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.578
Now, here this.

08:14.578 --> 08:18.040
Last week, the President sent in a
secret delta force unit,

08:18.040 --> 08:20.918
to wipe those bastards out,

08:20.918 --> 08:24.004
it was a king size failure.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.175
We got this tape an hour ago.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.065
Who are those guys?

08:43.065 --> 08:44.358
Ninja.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.528
That's the Japanese red vection army.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.530
That's the best them got.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.116
Along with the tapes, we got a message.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.494
All four prisoners will be burn alive,

08:55.494 --> 08:57.955
a week from today.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.792
Unless the United States pays a 
ransom of 50 million dollars...

09:01.792 --> 09:05.254
And release this all of god 
freedom fighters.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.465
Oh, this guys are crazy.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.759
Right, now here's our problem.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.971
We only have a few days before the
media get a hold of this...

09:13.971 --> 09:16.265
and all hell will break loose.

09:16.265 --> 09:20.143
The President will be force to
pay the ransom,

09:20.143 --> 09:25.983
or send in the B-2 bombers.

09:25.983 --> 09:30.237
When do I leave, Gavine?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.072
When you're both ready?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.448
Immediately!

09:33.448 --> 09:35.993
You're parachute in before dawn.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.495
The local operative will 
meet you there.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.833
The password will be: The Big Blue
Racking Crew.

09:42.833 --> 09:48.213
You get the rest of your 
instructions there.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.381
Carl.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.801
Would you excuse us for a moment,
please?

09:52.801 --> 09:56.555
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.568
What the hell is going on, Gavine?

10:09.568 --> 10:10.736
Carl?

10:11.737 --> 10:14.656
Carl is not a field operative.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.617
You haven't red his files.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.910
I have.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.912
He came top of his class.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.831
A brilliant linguist,
a superb marksman.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.375
He's the best train 
operator we have.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.505
He's also a fantastic bowler,
but this is not a game, Gavine.

10:29.505 --> 10:32.090
Those were ninja.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.638
Where did training get 
your Delta Force?

10:37.638 --> 10:42.809
He's the best we have available!

10:42.809 --> 10:44.686
What about Joe Armstrong?

10:44.686 --> 10:45.687
Joe?

10:46.897 --> 10:48.732
Joe is with the peace core.

10:48.732 --> 10:52.528
His head is full of peace, 
love and life.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.820
Give him a call, Gavine.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
I did.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.033
He cut me off.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.625
Okay.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.384
Sean.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.266
Good luck.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.524
We gonna need it.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.777
Hey, Sean, wait up...

11:33.777 --> 11:39.157
40 seconds to jump time.

11:42.411 --> 11:46.373
We are on position.

13:14.670 --> 13:16.964
So where's our contact?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.131
This way.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.100
Hey, what was that?

13:28.141 --> 13:32.187
That could be him.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.534
Okay, that's far enough.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.078
Move, like you're hands on eggs...

13:48.078 --> 13:52.124
Because this thing is lucky to 
get off if I get nervous.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.709
Capisce?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.836
Capisce.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.046
Okay, who the hell are you?

13:58.046 --> 13:59.840
We are the "Big Blue Racking Crew".

13:59.840 --> 14:02.301
Whoa, why the hell didn't you 
say on the first place?

14:02.301 --> 14:04.678
Hi, I'm Pongo.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.263
The contact.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.016
The numbers out back.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.518
It's air conditioned.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.854
I don't know...

14:13.854 --> 14:16.231
I think he's been watching to
many movies.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.232
Yeah.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.985
Come on, get in.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.246
That's ridiculous!

14:31.246 --> 14:32.706
It's a new engine!

14:32.706 --> 14:36.210
Stupid hippo rust!

14:50.432 --> 14:53.227
- Yeah, Cagny no it was Brando.
- No it was Cagny.

14:53.227 --> 14:56.939
- No it was one eye Jackson and 
Marlon Brando... - It was Cagny.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.691
Cagny is my favourite.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.735
Hey, Marlon Brando is the boy, okay?

16:10.929 --> 16:13.473
Pongo, Pongo.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.659
What's so funny?

17:13.659 --> 17:15.743
Mowgli's friends.

17:15.743 --> 17:19.580
Why bother the best unit,
Delta Force could find.

17:19.580 --> 17:26.380
G-6 sent us 2 guys,
who look alike...

17:26.380 --> 17:28.715
That's what funny about.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.716
Hey, Igo.

17:30.384 --> 17:33.428
Throw this bums out of here.

18:38.827 --> 18:43.081
My apologise, gentlemen.
I'll make sure you are the right people.

18:43.081 --> 18:46.293
Come with me.

18:53.592 --> 19:01.433
Geez, guys,
that was really great!

19:04.228 --> 19:07.523
- Family?
- Yeah.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.399
Okay.

19:09.483 --> 19:16.949
Well here's a quick run down 
on the situation.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.702
There's a fort.

19:20.702 --> 19:24.456
Somewhere in the middle of that 
complex, is a bomb making facility...

19:24.456 --> 19:27.918
and the dungeons, holding the
four Americans...

19:27.918 --> 19:31.171
is almost impregnable, but...

19:31.171 --> 19:33.298
not quite.

19:54.862 --> 19:57.239
Hey, It's Mulgrew and O'Reilly!

19:57.239 --> 19:59.950
Holy shit, no!

20:06.874 --> 20:09.710
If anything happens, head straight
for Sulpher Springs...

20:09.710 --> 20:11.461
ask for Doktor Tamba.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.130
He's the only one can help ya.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.965
Okay, Sulpher Springs, Doktor Tamba.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.842
They musn't find you here.

20:32.858 --> 20:35.194
Hello, Freddy.

20:35.194 --> 20:40.741

20:40.741 --> 20:45.037

20:45.037 --> 20:47.456
Sorry colonel,I don't know what
strangers you're talking about.

20:47.456 --> 20:52.544

21:21.406 --> 21:26.787
Where are those two strangers? Huh?

21:27.329 --> 21:29.915
They are in the coffin.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.472
Don't kill them.

21:45.472 --> 21:49.935
I want those bastards alive.

21:59.111 --> 22:03.490
- Now where do we go?
- c'mon.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.785
You two go this way.

22:06.785 --> 22:09.538
You two round the back.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.389
Now what do we do?

22:27.389 --> 22:30.100
We get out of here.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.727
You guys alright?

22:31.727 --> 22:33.979
Where the hell did he come from?

22:33.979 --> 22:36.356
Hey look I'm really sorry ab...

22:36.356 --> 22:37.232
Shh... c'mon.

22:37.232 --> 22:38.817
Let's go.

22:50.621 --> 22:53.957
Okay, quick, this way.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.005
Hey listen, where are you taking us?

23:00.005 --> 23:04.301
Relax, I got this covered.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.889
Hi, Pongo.

23:08.889 --> 23:09.890
What's wrong?

23:09.890 --> 23:13.727
Mulgrew's men are aftering us.

23:13.727 --> 23:14.561
Okay.

23:16.563 --> 23:17.856
This way quick.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.608
C'mon!

23:24.363 --> 23:25.656
Where?

23:25.906 --> 23:26.949
What is this place?

23:26.949 --> 23:29.368
It's a mortuary.

23:29.660 --> 23:31.745
Inside.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.250
Is this what you do for a living?

23:36.250 --> 23:38.335
Inside.

23:47.219 --> 23:49.304
I hope they pay you well.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.640
Okay guys, get on the cloche.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.891
What, you gotta be kidding?

23:54.434 --> 23:55.894
Hurry, hurry...

24:02.568 --> 24:06.572
Kick it open...
Bloody idiots.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.240
Hi, you guys come for bodies?

24:08.240 --> 24:09.575
What bloody bodies?

24:09.575 --> 24:14.329
The bodies from Lipper Colony. They 
brought them in yesterday for autopsy.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.706
Lipper Colony you say?

24:15.706 --> 24:16.707
Yeah.

24:16.957 --> 24:20.127
No, we are looking for two 
very dangerous looking men.

24:20.127 --> 24:22.754
- Seen any?
- No, not since I left Chicago.

24:22.754 --> 24:27.050
Go on have a look around.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.664
Bloody hell.

25:30.531 --> 25:33.700
In second thoughts, I think
they went the other way.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.578
If you seen them, phone police
headquarters immediately.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.621
Okay, sure.

25:37.621 --> 25:40.541
No problem.

25:50.092 --> 25:51.927
Damn, that was close.

25:51.927 --> 25:55.013
I can't believe that worked.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.808
Guys, this is Sarah Pess
peace call.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.726
Saved my ass a dozen times.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.186
A dozen too many.

26:01.186 --> 26:02.187
Hi Sarah.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.897
Carl Brackston, CIA.

26:03.897 --> 26:04.982

26:04.982 --> 26:08.235

26:18.453 --> 26:20.706
Hey, where are you going?

26:20.706 --> 26:22.291
Sarah, look...

26:22.291 --> 26:24.251

26:25.586 --> 26:27.087
But I am involved.

26:27.087 --> 26:30.632
Mulgrew and his men will be after me.

26:33.635 --> 26:38.140
Look I can take you as far as
Sulpher Springs and that's it.

26:38.140 --> 26:38.974

26:39.224 --> 26:40.058
Okay.

26:54.364 --> 26:57.284
Okay Pongo, which way is to Sulpher Springs?

26:57.284 --> 26:58.452
That way.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.622
C'mon, let's make some time.

27:03.665 --> 27:07.419
You are not exactly build for
running are you?

27:07.419 --> 27:10.714
Who are those bastard?

27:10.714 --> 27:14.301
More bloody Americans.

27:15.928 --> 27:19.640
British S.A.S?

27:20.390 --> 27:26.647
Or maybe slime from Sulpher Springs?

27:27.356 --> 27:30.859
What's the matter gentlemen?

27:30.859 --> 27:34.071
Cat got your tounge?

27:39.743 --> 27:40.494
Well?

27:40.494 --> 27:46.500
Please Colonel, I don't know nothing.

27:50.295 --> 27:53.882
Now don't you make me loose my bloody 
temper, you asshole!

27:53.882 --> 27:56.426
Please Colonel, none of us ever 
saw them before.

27:56.426 --> 28:01.390
If we had, we would have told you,
I swear!

28:05.310 --> 28:09.773
This is all such a bore.

28:13.652 --> 28:15.445
You know I like you.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.615
I really really like you.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.867
Look.

28:19.867 --> 28:26.790
I give you 500 dollars and let you go,
if you told me who those men were.

28:26.790 --> 28:30.419
The demons send from hell to get you.

28:30.419 --> 28:35.716
Tell my friend the devil, I'm not
ready to come home yet.

28:38.719 --> 28:41.138
Have a nice day.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.618
Carl...

29:03.243 --> 29:05.329
get them undercover.

29:14.671 --> 29:19.676
Use your gun if you have to.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.637
What do you mean dissapear?

29:21.637 --> 29:24.097
I tracked them down half town 
to the main street...

29:24.097 --> 29:27.184
I have searched the place top to bottom.
There are no sign of anyone.

29:27.184 --> 29:29.978
Except for the American, peace congress,

29:29.978 --> 29:33.899
Well she obviously took them out 
the back way, you little prick!

29:33.899 --> 29:36.276
I should've kill her, when I killed
the father.

29:36.276 --> 29:39.655
Now you get your skinny ass onto the 
street, and find them immediately, 
you understand?

29:39.655 --> 29:41.615
Sir!

29:41.990 --> 29:44.993
Bloody idiot.

35:02.561 --> 35:04.855
My dear Scarfie, what concerned you?

35:04.855 --> 35:06.398
There's a problem.

35:06.398 --> 35:10.694
I think the Americans infiltrated
two more of their damn assassins. 

35:10.694 --> 35:13.614
Why so worried my dear friend?

35:13.614 --> 35:16.408
Have we not always dealt the pigs
of mortal blow everytime...

35:16.408 --> 35:18.118
...our paths have crossed?

35:18.118 --> 35:20.496
There is something that worries me
about this two.

35:20.496 --> 35:22.706
I think you should execute the prisoners
immediately...

35:22.706 --> 35:25.876
And make arrangments to have the bombs
transfer to Bairut as soon as you can.

35:25.876 --> 35:31.091
My dear Scarfie, you are far too impetuous.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.460
Bravo, bravo.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.254
Invincible.

36:52.254 --> 36:54.006
A man of steel.

36:54.006 --> 36:56.341
Amazing.

37:14.943 --> 37:15.944
Yes...

37:16.236 --> 37:22.034
It is as if they are almost proud to 
die like a man.

37:22.034 --> 37:26.663
I always try to impress upon my people
that to die in holy battle...

37:26.663 --> 37:28.999
...is a passport to heaven.

37:28.999 --> 37:34.505
It is always full of shit, Ali.

37:38.550 --> 37:42.471
Are these the Americans
of whom you spoke?

37:42.471 --> 37:43.472
Yes.

37:49.186 --> 37:52.022
I told you my dear Scrafie...

37:52.022 --> 37:56.485
...you worried to much.

38:04.493 --> 38:06.245
Watch.

40:08.492 --> 40:10.494
You American fuck...

40:10.494 --> 40:14.540
I going to teach you a lesson you'll 
never forget, as long as you live

40:14.540 --> 40:23.549
...and I'm happy to say, it won't
be very long.

40:39.022 --> 40:43.068
We will carried out the execution 
in 48 hours.

40:43.068 --> 40:48.657
I will inform the American embassador
and the President this evening.

40:48.657 --> 40:55.747
You didn't have a sense of the 
dramatic, Ali?

40:57.124 --> 40:59.668
So gentlemen...

40:59.668 --> 41:05.674
What're your names and what are
you doing here?

41:05.674 --> 41:07.426
I see...

41:08.135 --> 41:12.848
These other animals once thought they
were superiour to us mere mortals...

41:12.848 --> 41:18.061
Until I gave them a lesson in a foley
of full surprised.

41:18.061 --> 41:19.813
Watch.

41:35.537 --> 41:38.457
Lick my shoe.

42:14.243 --> 42:17.079
Now gentlemen, one more time.

42:17.079 --> 42:22.960
What are you names and what are
you doing here?

42:22.960 --> 42:25.212
Very well, gentlemen...

42:25.212 --> 42:35.347
This will be your first lesson in 
the blind obedience.

42:37.641 --> 42:39.476
Oh god.

42:57.619 --> 43:01.248
Do not kill them my dear Scarf... 

43:01.248 --> 43:06.628
They should give far more pleasure 
to Allah and myself alive.

43:06.628 --> 43:07.421
Come.

43:07.421 --> 43:11.800
Let us call Bairut and make arrangements.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.844
The girl...

43:15.179 --> 43:23.061
what she need is a stiff talking to her. 

43:52.716 --> 44:01.725
I'm gonna have you, but I won't
keep you too long.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.794
Morning, Joe!

44:28.794 --> 44:31.213
Good morning.

44:31.630 --> 44:32.464
Okay.

44:32.965 --> 44:38.512
Today lesson is gonna be about environment.

44:38.512 --> 44:41.598
EN-VIRON-MENT.

44:44.768 --> 44:46.687
What is environment?

44:46.687 --> 44:48.272
Our surroundings.

44:48.272 --> 44:53.652
Everything around us, okay?

44:59.783 --> 45:02.244
Now I want you to go outside...

45:02.244 --> 45:04.830
and find example of our environment.

45:04.830 --> 45:07.958
...when you come back we discuss it, okay?

45:07.958 --> 45:08.792
Okay.

45:18.552 --> 45:21.388
I told you last time, it was 
a last time.

45:21.388 --> 45:22.347
Joe.,,

45:22.347 --> 45:24.933
..you already know what happened
to Delta Force...

45:24.933 --> 45:27.102
Well we sent in two agents...

45:27.102 --> 45:30.522
They both been captured and they
will be executed...

45:30.522 --> 45:34.568
One of them is your friend, Sean.

45:34.568 --> 45:38.655
Everything you need to know is
right here.

45:38.655 --> 45:43.118
...incase you change your mind.

45:43.118 --> 45:47.206
We need you Joe.

46:51.436 --> 46:53.480
American?

46:53.564 --> 46:55.649
What exactly are you doing 
here Mr. Armstrong?

46:55.649 --> 46:56.900
Holiday

46:56.900 --> 47:00.946
- Profession?
- Teacher.

47:01.822 --> 47:06.660
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

47:19.464 --> 47:22.176
Joe Armstrong?

47:23.302 --> 47:25.846
Where to man?

47:32.561 --> 47:35.564
Sulpher Springs.

47:36.982 --> 47:40.777
Okay, quick get in.

47:48.285 --> 47:50.120
Am I glad to meet you.

47:50.120 --> 47:51.705
Hi, Pongo.

47:51.705 --> 47:54.416
Let's get out of here.

48:05.802 --> 48:07.638
Well that's the end of my story.

48:07.638 --> 48:10.557
You know, you got hell of a nerve,
Joe, Coming here.

48:10.557 --> 48:13.101
Sean and Carl couldn't even
handled these guys.

48:13.101 --> 48:15.187
Seems like nobody can.

48:15.187 --> 48:16.980
The guys might even be dead.

48:16.980 --> 48:19.066
Even Sarah.

48:19.066 --> 48:20.108
Who's Sarah?

48:20.108 --> 48:22.444
Americana, work on a peace call...

48:22.444 --> 48:29.243
She was helping us out, but got 
captured with the others.

48:29.243 --> 48:31.537
Tell me more about Sulpher Springs.

48:31.537 --> 48:34.373
Well, Sulpher Springs used to be
a peaceful colony.

48:34.373 --> 48:37.709
But after Bender became President,
the President's took over...

48:37.709 --> 48:39.503
and now, live there ever since.

48:39.503 --> 48:44.633
Nowdays its a rallying point for 
everyone who have pissed off on 
Mulgrew and his rats.

48:44.633 --> 48:47.177
Why hasn't Mulgrew and his men
blowing it up?

48:47.177 --> 48:50.806
They tried a while back, but got
a good kicked up their ass.

48:50.806 --> 48:54.184
That was before the ninjas 
arrived of course.

48:54.184 --> 48:55.811
Who's this guy, Tamba?

48:55.811 --> 48:58.188
Tamba, well he was the 
prison's doctor.

48:58.188 --> 48:59.731
Now he runs the joint.

48:59.731 --> 49:03.610
And now, if you can get Tamba 
and his guys to help you...

49:03.610 --> 49:15.664
there's a good chance you can do
what they been trying to do.

51:27.713 --> 51:29.464
Out!

51:33.427 --> 51:34.553
Who are you?

51:34.553 --> 51:36.013
Hi, I'm Pongo.

51:36.013 --> 51:38.849
...and that's Joe Armstrong.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.851
What do you want?

51:40.851 --> 51:42.936
Guy named Tamba.

51:42.936 --> 51:43.937
Well...

51:45.314 --> 51:48.066
never heard of him.

51:48.066 --> 51:50.152
My friend Freddie said he live here.

51:50.152 --> 51:54.239
And he could used some good men.

51:54.239 --> 51:56.950
Good men?

52:04.958 --> 52:06.126
This way.

52:06.919 --> 52:08.378
In.

53:02.474 --> 53:03.934
Carlos.

53:05.018 --> 53:08.981
We are always looking for good men?

53:08.981 --> 53:13.902
Mr. Armstrong, why don't you show 
us how good you are?

53:13.902 --> 53:15.362
You ain't see nothing yet.

53:15.362 --> 53:17.948
He'll take all three of you in
the same time.

53:17.948 --> 53:20.826
That's a big boost Mr. Armstrong.

53:20.826 --> 53:21.869
The three of us?

53:21.869 --> 53:23.287
Yeah, all three.

53:23.287 --> 53:29.293
Not here.

54:38.028 --> 54:40.364
Hey, stop this!

54:40.531 --> 54:42.449
Stop it!

54:42.449 --> 54:44.993
The man won, fair and square.

54:44.993 --> 54:51.124
We need man like him.

54:58.632 --> 55:01.844
Very impressive Mr. Armstrong.

55:01.844 --> 55:06.598
Welcome to Sulpher Springs.

55:07.432 --> 55:10.269
Come up here.

55:46.138 --> 55:48.515
I am Doctor Tamba.

55:48.515 --> 55:51.226
Joe Armstrong.

55:55.063 --> 55:57.232
Paul Freddie told Pongo about me?

55:57.232 --> 55:59.860
Yea, he said you, the only guy
who can help us.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.487
What can I help you?

56:01.487 --> 56:06.158
Well, we have to rescue the Americans
from the guard executioners.

56:06.158 --> 56:12.414
So, if you can get us to the Dragon fort
and make as many diversion as possible

56:12.414 --> 56:13.999
...we may have a chance.

56:13.999 --> 56:16.919
Getting into the fortress
supposed to be impossible.

56:16.919 --> 56:17.920
Yeah...

56:17.920 --> 56:20.714
but there may just be a way.

56:20.714 --> 56:24.968
Many years ago, the British dug 
ammunition tunnels underneth the fort.

56:24.968 --> 56:28.931
These were flooded when the
Dragon river overflowed.

56:28.931 --> 56:32.392
Over 200 British troops were drown.

56:32.392 --> 56:36.605
The engineers dug in from the other 
side of the mountain to release the water

56:36.605 --> 56:41.068
everybody thinks that this tunnels
were dinamited shut.

56:41.068 --> 56:45.113
But we think, maybe they missed one.

56:45.113 --> 56:48.116
All the engineering plans are
kepted at Pacific Centre.

56:48.116 --> 56:51.829
President Bender is going to
a reception there...

56:51.829 --> 56:54.748
for the Ted welfare finance minister.

56:54.748 --> 57:05.592
Perhaps we could all go as 
uninvited guests, hmm?

57:44.089 --> 57:49.094
Mr. President, my government has
instructed me to inform you that
Sheikh Ali Maksood

57:49.094 --> 57:54.099
and his associates release the
hostages immediately...

57:54.099 --> 57:56.560
I can't believe my eyes.

57:56.560 --> 57:57.811
Mr. President...

57:57.811 --> 58:02.691
who invited that scum?

58:07.696 --> 58:10.574
You were saying, Mr. Ambassador?

58:10.574 --> 58:14.369
I was refering to you and your 
associates as

58:14.369 --> 58:15.829
scum, Sir.

58:17.372 --> 58:21.752
Ah yes, a popular American expression

58:21.752 --> 58:26.507
... when refering to other races.

58:26.507 --> 58:31.512
Mr. Ambassador, we have very important
thing to tell you.

58:31.512 --> 58:34.806
Oh, that so? What do you want?

58:34.806 --> 58:38.519
- Somewhere quite, perhaps.
- After you.

58:38.519 --> 58:40.568
- O'Reilly, keep an eye on things.
- Now, hold this.

58:57.746 --> 59:00.833
...that we have captured another 
two of your adventurers...

59:00.833 --> 59:03.043
and an American nurse.

59:03.043 --> 59:07.506
They will be executed with the
other 'scum'.

59:07.506 --> 59:09.341
What do you mean the 'others'
you pig?

59:09.341 --> 59:11.093
Oh yes...

59:11.093 --> 59:14.388
We also wish to tell you, we have 
move the execution forward,

59:14.388 --> 59:19.810
It will now take place 
tomorrow morning.

59:19.810 --> 59:22.938
Remember, the basement in 9:45

59:22.938 --> 59:23.772
Okay.

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.190
Hey, you!

01:00:06.773 --> 01:00:08.484
Where do you thing you're going?

01:00:08.484 --> 01:00:10.152
There you are.

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:14.239
My son, I'm having confession down
stairs and I like you to come.

01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:15.574
Confession?

01:00:17.201 --> 01:00:18.785
You are under arrest.

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:22.623
Oh no, my son.

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:31.173
Bless you, my son.

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:41.034
You so as much harm one hair...

01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:42.953
on one of those men heads...

01:01:42.953 --> 01:01:46.331
and I will personaly see this
place disintegrated.

01:01:46.331 --> 01:01:53.672
Then New York will quickly follow 
soon, Mr. Ambassador.

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:55.132
You basterds.

01:01:56.341 --> 01:02:02.389
Well, you are such a rat sometimes, Ali.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.891
What's that?

01:02:08.604 --> 01:02:11.565
What the hell are you doing
down there, O'Reilly?

01:02:11.565 --> 01:02:12.816
Bloody priest!

01:02:12.816 --> 01:02:16.945
What bloody priest?

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:23.076
I show you, he's a priest.
He's holding...

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:25.454
confession downstairs
in the basement.

01:02:25.454 --> 01:02:26.705
Are you mad?

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:28.499
There are no bloody priest.
I shot them, old months ago.

01:02:46.767 --> 01:02:47.810
Priest? You idiot!

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:55.067
Some basterds is after the plan
to the fort!

01:03:35.399 --> 01:03:37.067
We can get in here.

01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:39.987
Thru the cliff's loose gate.

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:51.081
They didn't think anyone who'll be
crazy enough to try climb up there.

01:04:08.515 --> 01:04:12.186
How are you doing?

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:16.023
I know we all gonna die.

01:04:17.441 --> 01:04:20.319
Mulgrew kept my father...

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:22.988
I know he's gonna kill us.

01:04:22.988 --> 01:04:29.620
I never thought its gonna end
like this.

01:04:30.746 --> 01:04:33.499
I do not like it, Scarf.

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:35.709
Why did they want the plan
to the fort?

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:42.758
To find a bloody way in of course.

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:53.060
Macca is that way, old chap.

01:04:53.977 --> 01:04:57.147
Anyway, they're isn't one...

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:59.233
trust me.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.904
What are you plans, Ali?

01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:11.036
Helicopter will arrive tomorrow,
to collect the bomb.

01:05:11.036 --> 01:05:15.332
If necessary, we can leave with it.

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:16.875
I'm gonna bet.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:20.087
Wake me in the morning.

01:07:14.952 --> 01:07:17.204
People of Sulpher Springs!

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.122
We have a mission!

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:23.210
- We must fight for our freedom!
- Freedom!!!

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.629
With the help of the American,

01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:29.967
who have proof himself to be our
friend and our equal!

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:38.976
We must finally free ourself,
of the powers of darkness!

01:08:14.136 --> 01:08:17.014
Colonel, come quick!

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:19.057
Colonel!

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:20.559
What do you want?

01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:21.810
It's an emergency.

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:23.145
They are riotting all over the place.

01:08:23.145 --> 01:08:25.104
- Who is?
- Sulpher Springs.

01:08:25.104 --> 01:08:28.649
Well, cut the slime like dogs and 
no mercy, do you understand?

01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:31.448
I don't know the meaning of the
words your honour.

01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:52.299
You are early, Scarfe.

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:55.344
Something's up.

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:03.060
I want to see the prisoners.

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:47.312
All still here, gentlemen.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:49.398
Good.

01:09:51.733 --> 01:09:57.114
Plus the playmate of the month.

01:10:00.284 --> 01:10:02.035
Stop it!

01:10:14.131 --> 01:10:16.884
Damn you!

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:18.177
Silence!

01:10:19.845 --> 01:10:23.599
Prepare them for execution.

01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:28.937
Take me to the lab.

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:56.215
There she is.

01:10:57.424 --> 01:11:00.135
Made by the hand of Allah,

01:11:00.135 --> 01:11:09.353
to bring the great satans, 
to his knees.

01:11:20.864 --> 01:11:24.910
Why the hell do you do 
that old chap?

01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:35.128
It feels me with ectasy, to think that I 
was just 1 second away from meeting Allah.

01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:37.589
Is there another way in to this lab?

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:38.590
No.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:40.050
Good.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:55.149
Tell them to keep on guard, and tell them
to keep their hands off the bloody bomb!

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.333
I got a bad feeling about this, Sean.

01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:17.629
It's not over yet.

01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:36.250
Alright, you basterds.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:38.377
That's far enough!

01:13:38.377 --> 01:13:42.339
This is a legal gathering!

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:10.909
- You all under arrest!
- Attack!

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:56.580
Quick.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.540
Get me into the fort.

01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.000
Bastards.

01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:59.393
Where's that noise coming from?

01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:04.481
From the old ammunition tunnels,
underneth. I think.

01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:07.860
Old ammunition tunnels?

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.195
Bloody hell! there're coming from 
the ammo tunnels...

01:16:10.195 --> 01:16:12.447
that's why they want the engineering plans!

01:16:12.447 --> 01:16:14.783
I must be going bloody senile!

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:16.618
Oh my god!

01:16:16.618 --> 01:16:19.163
Sound the alarm.

01:16:19.163 --> 01:16:23.375
Move the bomb to the helicopter 
immediately and proceed the execution.

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:28.297
The rest of you, get down 
there and kill them.

01:16:28.297 --> 01:16:30.549
Go!

01:17:24.436 --> 01:17:26.355
Is this dangerous?
(in foreign language)

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:29.817
Exquisitely dangerous, my son.

01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:31.735
Treat it with care.

01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:36.532
It does enough power to blow New York
off the face of the earth.

01:17:36.532 --> 01:17:39.284
Allah goes with it.

01:18:08.522 --> 01:18:11.525
Kill!
KIll!

01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:51.059
Sean?

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.868
Sean?

01:21:24.426 --> 01:21:26.053
C'mon, let's go.

01:21:26.053 --> 01:21:27.930
We need to be hurry

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:28.764
You, okay?

01:21:37.564 --> 01:21:40.067
What are you doing?!

01:21:40.067 --> 01:21:41.235
Sean.

01:21:41.527 --> 01:21:42.820
Silance!

01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:46.865
True believers,

01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:51.161
last night

01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:54.039
I heard a jackle

01:21:54.039 --> 01:21:57.543
scream in the mouth.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.753
It was an omen

01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:03.257
sent to me by Allah,

01:22:03.257 --> 01:22:06.969
to tell me, that I have been

01:22:06.969 --> 01:22:09.513
to merciful.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.474
So my children,

01:22:12.474 --> 01:22:15.644
because the great satan

01:22:15.644 --> 01:22:20.858
has not fulfill the just immane...

01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:36.373
Fight Joe.

01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:40.062
This American criminals...

01:24:06.672 --> 01:24:09.383
Get on with it, Ali.

01:24:09.675 --> 01:24:13.262
Let the execution begin!

01:25:16.909 --> 01:25:18.076
No.

01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:20.913
No!

01:25:27.628 --> 01:25:29.713
Please God no!

01:25:29.713 --> 01:25:31.298
Release me!

01:25:31.298 --> 01:25:32.299
No!

01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:31.150
Kill the infidel.

01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:32.609
Hayaku.

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:41.618
You guys okay?

01:27:34.379 --> 01:27:35.714
Kill them.

01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:37.174
Kill the cowards!

01:27:37.174 --> 01:27:40.469
Kill the unbelievers!

01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:17.232
No, you stay here.

01:29:17.232 --> 01:29:26.450
I'll be back for you, 
as soon as I can.

01:30:04.029 --> 01:30:05.322
- Go!
- Where to?

01:30:05.531 --> 01:30:07.491
Macca.

01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:44.403
You Arab prick!

01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:46.196
You bloody were all the same!

01:30:46.196 --> 01:30:51.660
A bunch of inconcinnous!
The whole bloody Arabia.

01:31:11.054 --> 01:31:13.182
Come here you bitch.

01:31:13.182 --> 01:31:14.349
Sean!

01:31:18.937 --> 01:31:20.105
Sean!

01:31:30.199 --> 01:31:31.200
No.

01:32:52.322 --> 01:32:53.615
Sarah.

01:35:20.471 --> 01:35:22.222
Oh God.

01:35:22.222 --> 01:35:24.725
It's over.

01:35:24.725 --> 01:35:28.979
Everything's gonna be okay now.

01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:35.611
Why did the ninja untie you?

01:35:35.611 --> 01:35:38.238
Well, that's a friend of mine.

01:35:38.238 --> 01:35:49.041
He's not much for words, but he
comes through at the end.

01:35:51.502 --> 01:35:52.961
Nice.

01:36:41.218 --> 01:36:42.386
Sean.

01:36:45.097 --> 01:36:49.852
You can find me at the school.
