00:05.880 --> 00:09.926
-[Shadow] What did you do?
-[Tails] Be careful. Sonic, wait!

00:10.010 --> 00:11.344
[screaming, explosion]

00:16.516 --> 00:17.892
Sonic.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.522
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.816
[Amy] The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.652
[Knuckles] I don't need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

00:27.736 --> 00:31.156
[Rouge] You may not like the way
I do things but I get things done.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.616
[Amy] I may be the one
who can bring everyone together,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.703
but there's only one hedgehog
they'll follow into battle.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.003
[Shadow groaning]

00:46.713 --> 00:48.465
[Shadow grunts]

00:56.723 --> 00:58.141
The Chaos Emerald!

01:02.270 --> 01:03.772
[groans]

01:03.855 --> 01:04.731
My shoes.

01:05.356 --> 01:06.274
Attach these.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.445
[Nine] This energy is still a mystery.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.281
[foreboding music]

01:15.742 --> 01:17.952
[Sonic groaning]

01:29.839 --> 01:31.299
Sonic, it's broken.

01:31.382 --> 01:32.926
It's all broken.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.730
[Sonic yelling]

01:51.903 --> 01:52.821
Sonic!

01:59.577 --> 02:01.371
Huh? What's going on?

02:02.205 --> 02:05.250
Sonic! Keep running! Do not stop!

02:13.925 --> 02:15.385
[Sonic yelling]

02:17.011 --> 02:17.846
Ugh!

02:19.389 --> 02:21.307
[Sonic groans]

02:21.391 --> 02:23.143
Shadow?

02:23.226 --> 02:26.312
[theme music plays]

02:33.236 --> 02:36.239
I don't have time
to deal with whoever you are.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.241
I just wanna go home.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.953
Home? Home doesn't exist anymore,

02:42.036 --> 02:43.496
because of you!

02:44.998 --> 02:46.624
[Sonic gasps, groans]

02:50.086 --> 02:53.256
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Ooh! Ooh! Ahh!

02:53.339 --> 02:55.508
[sighs] Can't you just leave me alone.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.678
[yells]

02:58.761 --> 02:59.637
[growls]

03:05.894 --> 03:09.355
Alright, gonna get back to New Yoke City.
Find Nine.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.400
Heh, maybe Nine will pass through
and I can catch a ride.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.654
Ugh, you again. Let me guess,
you're Grumpy Shadow.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.448
Although that would be redundant.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.782
Shadow who needs a shower.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.910
Sheriff Shadow of floating rock world!

03:22.785 --> 03:24.495
[booster rocket roars]

03:24.579 --> 03:25.872
[Sonic yelps]

03:29.876 --> 03:31.002
[Sonic yelps]

03:33.630 --> 03:37.467
I'm stuck in here
and it's all your fault, Sonic!

03:37.550 --> 03:39.969
Yeah, yeah, what else is new?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.138
Wait, how do you know my name?

03:42.222 --> 03:46.184
Unless... [gasps] Shadow, you're you!

03:46.267 --> 03:48.853
-The real you!
-The only me.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.731
[Shadow groans]

03:52.190 --> 03:53.983
You just don't listen.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.862
What part of
"our home doesn't exist anymore"

03:57.946 --> 03:59.739
are you not understanding?

04:01.157 --> 04:03.076
What did you just say?

04:03.159 --> 04:06.204
What do you think
I've been trying to tell you?

04:06.287 --> 04:10.124
When you broke the Paradox Prism,
you broke our reality.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.210
Green Hill is gone.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.212
It doesn't exist anymore.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.549
I know I caused this.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.386
It just keeps getting worse.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.472
-[sombre music]
-[Shadow sighs]

04:25.181 --> 04:26.766
Follow me.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.444
How did you end up in here?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.281
I chased you up the Temple Mountain
and into the cave

04:41.364 --> 04:43.241
just as you shattered the Prism.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.868
So I used the Chaos Emerald
to teleport out.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.955
But when I reappeared, I was here.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.291
Stuck between the Shatter spaces.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.876
[ethereal music]

04:54.544 --> 04:56.546
Yeah. The Void.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.510
[Sonic]
So that must be the New Yoke City Gateway.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.101
Have you been able to see me
this whole time?

05:10.184 --> 05:11.311
Not exactly.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.189
When you get going fast
you kick up Prism energy

05:15.273 --> 05:17.483
and it thins the veil to the Void.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.861
It's like it's opening a portal

05:19.944 --> 05:21.571
through the Gateway.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.700
So that must be how
I teleported into No Place.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.578
I was looking for Nine,
I started running fast

05:28.661 --> 05:31.748
and then suddenly
I portalled out of New Yoke.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.505
I've tracked you
as you've gone from Gateway to Gateway.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.260
No Place.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.724
Boscage Maze.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.064
What's down there?

05:59.484 --> 06:00.610
[Shadow groaning]

06:01.235 --> 06:02.945
[Shadow] Not sure.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.491
From what I can tell,
it's an eternity of darkness.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.119
That decays all life.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.331
[sighs] Game over.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.209
Why didn't you just follow me in?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.297
You can get into those places,
but I can't.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.758
With one exception.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.055
When you unleashed a shockwave
from New Yoke

06:29.138 --> 06:31.599
it blew me back to the outer reaches
of the Void.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.851
And lead me here.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.106
And for reasons I haven't figured out yet

06:38.189 --> 06:40.316
this Gateway let me in.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.069
Maybe it's because the shatter space
isn't fully formed,

06:43.152 --> 06:46.072
or maybe it's decaying, I'm not sure.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.281
But it's not whole.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.951
Like a ghost.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.371
So, then... what is this place?

06:54.580 --> 06:55.957
Come see for yourself.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.460
[forboding music]

07:04.674 --> 07:06.676
[cosmic whirring]

07:07.760 --> 07:09.595
[Sonic yelping]

07:13.599 --> 07:15.435
[Sonic groans]

07:18.813 --> 07:22.108
Whoa, this one looks like home!

07:25.611 --> 07:27.488
The loop de loop!

07:28.698 --> 07:30.575
Hedgehog's Pass.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.411
Tails' lab!

07:34.829 --> 07:36.456
Palm trees!

07:37.665 --> 07:39.834
Mmm, just like home.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.421
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman!

07:45.798 --> 07:46.924
Tails!

07:50.887 --> 07:53.806
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman!

07:54.891 --> 07:59.437
Oh, Tails, you have no idea
how much I've missed hearing that.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.064
The forest is the most beautiful
place on Earth.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.316
Amy!

08:03.399 --> 08:06.444
I don't need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

08:06.527 --> 08:10.865
Ah! Boy, have I missed you guys!
Even you, Knuckles.

08:10.948 --> 08:14.410
You may not like the way I do things
but I get things done.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.747
Nah, no complaints from me, Rouge.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.791
As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.712
Huh? Yeah, you just said that.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.381
Buddy, I'm right here.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.051
The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.138
I don't need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.642
You may not like the way I do things
but I get things done.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.478
As long as I'm around, you'll always...

08:40.561 --> 08:42.146
What's wrong with them?

08:42.230 --> 08:45.107
It's a Shatter space, Sonic,
just like the others.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.735
A cruel version to make us suffer.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.488
[Amy] The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.325
I don't need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.663
You may not like the way I do things
but I get things done.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.166
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.461
[Amy] The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.839
[Knuckles] I don't need the details,
just tell me who to smash.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.133
It was cool the first couple of times.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.386
[sighs]

09:16.222 --> 09:18.849
[Amy] The forest is the most
beautiful place on Earth.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.687
How do I fix this?

09:24.355 --> 09:26.399
[sighs] Come with me.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.527
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.031
-No problem, Sonic.
-[frog croaks]

09:34.991 --> 09:37.785
-No problem, Sonic.
-[frog croaks]

09:39.161 --> 09:41.205
[exciting music]

09:54.844 --> 09:55.886
Sonic.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.314
[electronic whirring]

10:10.901 --> 10:12.236
[Sonic sighs]

10:12.320 --> 10:15.197
I guess that's a ghost, too.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.534
[ethereal music]

10:26.834 --> 10:28.669
[Tails] We don't know
what the Prism's capable of.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.297
[Amy] If Eggman wants it,
it can't be good.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.341
[Sonic] Step away from the rock, egghead.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.925
[Tails] Sonic, wait!

10:35.009 --> 10:37.094
[all] Sonic, no!

10:37.178 --> 10:38.012
[explosion]

10:41.766 --> 10:44.393
I would do anything to be back...

10:45.186 --> 10:46.312
Home.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.775
There is a chance.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.907
Every Shatter space contains a shard,

10:57.990 --> 11:00.826
creates a distorted version
of our reality.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.036
That means this one...

11:02.119 --> 11:03.871
Has to be real!

11:04.538 --> 11:05.831
[pulsating]

11:06.999 --> 11:08.876
Exactly.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.002
Don't!

11:10.711 --> 11:12.588
I wasn't going to touch it.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.758
I was just pointing at it
to tell you not to touch it.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.552
Here's the plan.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.848
The Ghost Prism shows us how the other
shards need to be placed together.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.935
If we bring them back here
and connect them to this one,

11:26.018 --> 11:28.521
this real one, then maybe...

11:28.604 --> 11:31.690
Yeah. Yeah, that could work.
It has to work!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.485
We gotta show Nine.
He's, like, super smart!

11:34.568 --> 11:36.821
-He knows a ton about Prism energy. He--
-No.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.864
-No? Why no?
-No.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.200
I just said he's, like, super smart.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.493
He can't be trusted.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.204
What are you talking about?
Of course he can!

11:45.287 --> 11:46.580
He's just like Tails.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.833
He's just a little angsty, that's all.

11:48.916 --> 11:52.002
No. He's not Tails, he's Nine.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.838
And they're not your real friends.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.216
Dude, he's real. This is his reality.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.717
And you know what else is real?

11:58.801 --> 12:01.345
Nine's tech on my kicks
and punching sticks.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.265
So back up off Nine.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.768
-[groans]
-[sighs] Okay, look.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.146
What matters right now
is that I get the shards.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.814
I'll bring them back here and then we--

12:11.897 --> 12:13.607
That's not the plan.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.776
Wait, dude, not the plan?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.279
I'm totally confused.
I thought a moment ago you said--

12:18.362 --> 12:21.407
Sonic, you literally broke our world.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.908
Why would I trust you to do anything?

12:22.992 --> 12:26.495
Okay, I can see how you might think that.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.122
-But--
-[angry grunt]

12:29.039 --> 12:31.625
-[Sonic groans]
-[intense electronic music playing]

12:31.709 --> 12:33.043
Your turn is over.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.046
I'm taking the tech
and I'm going after the shards myself.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.673
No way, Shadow!

12:37.756 --> 12:40.509
I know what you're capable of,
and that's not gonna happen!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.887
Nine and all the rest of them are real!

12:42.970 --> 12:46.223
So the only way you're taking my tech
is over my dead--

12:46.307 --> 12:48.434
[Sonic groans]

12:48.517 --> 12:49.643
[heavy sigh]

12:49.727 --> 12:52.396
You could've at least let me finish
what I was going to say!

12:53.522 --> 12:54.815
[Sonic grunts]

12:56.442 --> 12:57.902
[Shadow] Ugh!

13:12.750 --> 13:13.709
That's one.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.085
Three to go.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.130
Want it back? Come and get it.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.258
[fight music playing]

13:30.226 --> 13:33.354
[Tails] As long as I'm around,
you'll always have a wingman.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.495
Two and three.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.013
[Sonic spluttering]

14:08.722 --> 14:10.766
[Sonic heavy panting, spluttering]

14:10.849 --> 14:13.143
That's it, I got them all.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.187
Now I can enter the Gateways,
just like you.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.107
You sure about that?

14:18.190 --> 14:19.942
[energetic music playing]

14:23.779 --> 14:26.448
-No problem, Sonic.
-[frog croaks]

14:38.711 --> 14:39.920
[music continues]

14:51.432 --> 14:54.560
[sighs] One left. Come at me, bro!

14:54.643 --> 14:57.104
-Nah, I'm good.
-[tech shimmers]

14:57.187 --> 14:58.814
Huh? No!

15:00.733 --> 15:03.277
So long, Sonic. See ya back home.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.696
No, no, no, no!

15:15.122 --> 15:16.457
What? Ah!

15:27.384 --> 15:28.594
[whirring]

15:29.595 --> 15:31.931
Rrrah! Rrrr!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.224
[groans]

15:36.685 --> 15:38.520
[Shadow] When you get going fast

15:38.604 --> 15:42.566
you kick up Prism energy
and it thins the veil to the Void.

15:42.650 --> 15:47.154
It's like it's opening a portal
through the Gateway.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.697
[music intensifies]

15:53.702 --> 15:56.372
[Sonic groans]

15:57.915 --> 15:59.416
[explosion]

16:08.050 --> 16:10.010
[tense music]

16:19.311 --> 16:20.980
Give me back my te-- Aah!

16:28.529 --> 16:30.072
[crashing, shattering]

16:38.706 --> 16:40.916
[loud whirring]

16:50.467 --> 16:51.927
Come at me, bro.

16:55.723 --> 16:56.974
Huh?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.646
[ominous music]

17:15.701 --> 17:17.453
The Chaos Council?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.457
Oh, no.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.792
They're headed to the Boscage!

17:39.475 --> 17:40.768
[Shadow groans]

17:49.693 --> 17:51.278
[Shadows yells]

17:57.910 --> 17:59.036
Shadow!

18:15.886 --> 18:16.804
No!

18:16.887 --> 18:18.597
No, no, no, no!

18:18.680 --> 18:19.932
Shadow!

18:20.015 --> 18:21.809
Shadow!

18:29.566 --> 18:31.944
[thrilling music]

18:52.422 --> 18:54.591
[panting] Wooo!

18:54.675 --> 18:57.136
I am exhausted!

18:57.219 --> 18:59.012
[Shadow groans]

18:59.763 --> 19:02.599
You're not dead. You're welcome.

19:02.683 --> 19:07.187
On the bright side,
I'll get to hold this over you forever.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.274
Oh, and, er, I'll take my tech back.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.025
[grumbles]

19:13.861 --> 19:16.029
[electronic zapping]

19:16.113 --> 19:17.823
Ha-ha, got ya!

19:19.324 --> 19:21.326
Rrr, I don't understand.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.413
I thought the tech would
get me through the Gateways.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.998
Why didn't it work?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.875
I saw Nine give you the tech.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.626
In the lab,

19:29.710 --> 19:32.504
you kicked up the prismatic energy
when you ran fast

19:32.588 --> 19:34.506
and crossed over into the Void.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.425
I just assumed it was the tech.

19:37.968 --> 19:41.096
But it's something else... it's you.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.642
I guess that makes me
kind of special, right?

19:45.726 --> 19:46.852
[grumbles]

19:46.935 --> 19:49.855
The only way to fix
the reality you shattered

19:49.938 --> 19:52.774
is if we... work...

19:52.858 --> 19:54.359
-together.
-Together?

19:56.778 --> 19:58.071
[groans]

19:58.655 --> 20:01.408
Wow. Coming from you that's, well,

20:01.491 --> 20:03.744
not like you at all.

20:03.827 --> 20:07.664
Man, you must really hate
having to admit you need me.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.625
You need me.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.668
Sure, I'm big enough to admit that.

20:11.752 --> 20:15.464
But, not as much as you need me.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.572
Oh, no.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.616
I won't let you down, Shadow.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.035
Together, we're gonna fix this.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.412
[uplifting music]

20:50.582 --> 20:52.793
[theme music plays]
