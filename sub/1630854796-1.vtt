WEBVTT

03:36.933 --> 03:39.000
-Early start, Professor?
-Yeah.

03:39.033 --> 03:41.033
I guess we're not following
dive protocols today.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.733
-Thanks, Gitundu.
-Right? OK!

03:42.767 --> 03:44.067
Sorry!

03:44.100 --> 03:46.167
And good morning
to you too, Abby!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.767
How you going, little fella?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.100
You miss me?

04:33.367 --> 04:35.267
It's not good news, I'm afraid.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.067
Your home's dying

04:39.100 --> 04:40.933
and I don't know how to help.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.000
Abby?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.500
Hey, you've got a call.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.167
Oh, really? Thanks.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.000
Hi. Is this Abby Jackson?

05:05.033 --> 05:06.167
Yes.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.567
This is Dr Levine from

05:07.600 --> 05:10.500
the Longboat Bay Hospital
in Western Australia.

05:10.533 --> 05:13.033
Apologies about
the different time zones,

05:13.067 --> 05:15.100
but your mother's here with us.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.900
She's suffered a stroke.

05:16.933 --> 05:19.733
How severe was it?
Is she stable?

05:19.767 --> 05:21.900
She's awake now and stable,

05:21.933 --> 05:24.600
but she's unable
to speak at this stage.

05:24.633 --> 05:26.667
We were hoping
you'd be able to get here.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.967
Yes, of course.
I...I need to be there.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.600
-Thanks for...for finding me.
-Yes, of course.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.300
-And letting me know.
-Thanks, Abby.

05:39.567 --> 05:42.567
Abby? Everything OK?

05:42.600 --> 05:44.833
Something's come up.

05:44.867 --> 05:46.567
My mum's had a stroke.

05:47.567 --> 05:49.500
You need to go back home.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.733
Abby?

06:17.533 --> 06:19.133
Abby!

06:32.767 --> 06:34.867
Come on, sleepy head.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.433
Mum, I was dreaming.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.433
Congratulations, Abby.

06:44.133 --> 06:45.733
You're awake.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.133
Come on.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.800
-Today is the day.
-My birthday?

06:51.833 --> 06:54.667
-You're eight years old.
-Yeah.

06:55.667 --> 06:57.233
You know
what that means?

07:00.367 --> 07:02.300
Come on!

07:04.467 --> 07:06.833
Maybe not this year.

07:06.867 --> 07:08.367
Mum!

07:09.567 --> 07:11.533
-Mum...
-Come on.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.233
Whoo!

07:55.600 --> 07:57.367
That's where
you're going.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.200
I can't, Mum. It's too far.

08:00.867 --> 08:02.367
It's just a warm-up.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.900
Abby, you're a big girl now

08:07.933 --> 08:09.900
and you've been
swimming like a fish

08:09.933 --> 08:13.033
since you were
18 months old, yeah?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.300
No, Mum. Please don't.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.333
No, Mum! No!

08:42.200 --> 08:44.133
You're gonna have to try now.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.567
Alright?

08:51.833 --> 08:54.433
Straight down,
follow the chain.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.300
-Equalise.
-OK.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.833
Just glide.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
You got it?

10:15.433 --> 10:17.000
I did it.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.900
Come in.
Come here. Come up.

10:18.933 --> 10:22.967
Oh, I'm so, so proud
of you, alright?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.367
Now I know you can
swim that deep...

10:25.400 --> 10:26.767
Yeah.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.467
..there's something
I want you to see, alright?

10:28.500 --> 10:29.800
OK.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.667
-Come here.
-I did it.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.433
So this here
is Robber's Head.

11:01.867 --> 11:05.067
Now, the reef
splits apart here

11:05.100 --> 11:08.767
so there's caves
and crevices who knows where,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.100
far too deep for you and me.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.733
This is the deepest
part of the bay.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.667
-You up for it?
-Yeah.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.133
Right. OK.

11:28.567 --> 11:30.800
Weight belts
for this dive.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.300
And, remember, we only take...

11:35.333 --> 11:38.267
..one abalone in three.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.800
That way,
they'll still be here

11:40.833 --> 11:44.267
for your children's
children to fish.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.967
Are you coming?

12:54.467 --> 12:55.967
Ohh!

13:09.500 --> 13:11.333
Mum, get in the boat.
There's something down there.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.600
It's OK, love.

13:12.633 --> 13:14.433
-It nearly got me.
-Come on, Abby.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.200
-Abby, Abby, take a look.
-No, Mum.

13:16.233 --> 13:18.467
-Just please get in the boat.
-Abby, Abby, Abby, quick.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.733
-I thought it was a shark.
-No.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.233
That's a groper.

13:37.267 --> 13:40.900
Come on. Let's go say hello.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.033
I really
can't believe it.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.600
He's big enough
to eat your arm off.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.300
Must be old to grow that big.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.267
Yep.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.700
Gropers can live
until their 70s.

15:18.733 --> 15:21.600
Old and wise.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.267
You must have made him
feel safe, Abs.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.067
He'll always be safe with me.

15:28.067 --> 15:31.600
Well, the only way
to make sure he's safe...

15:32.567 --> 15:34.867
..is to keep him a secret.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.367
You see, gropers,

15:36.400 --> 15:39.500
they live in the same place
most of their life.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.733
They don't tend to leave.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.167
Blueback.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.833
We'll call him Blueback

15:50.867 --> 15:54.400
and keep him a secret forever.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.300
Blueback?

15:58.067 --> 16:00.133
I like that.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.300
-Thanks.
-See ya.

16:18.267 --> 16:19.667
What are you doing here?

16:19.700 --> 16:21.233
Briggs, you lunatic.

16:21.267 --> 16:23.867
Professor,
some of us still live here.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.833
Don't 'professor' me.

16:33.867 --> 16:36.167
-You alright?
-Yeah, thanks, Briggs.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.800
Give me your bag.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.333
The first stroke wasn't
so bad. You know Dora.

16:43.367 --> 16:46.800
She said she felt
"a bit ordinary" after a swim.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.900
Didn't even go to the doctor's
till the next day,

16:48.933 --> 16:50.467
and that was in April.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.400
Then...

16:52.433 --> 16:54.967
..she was out by Robber's Head.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.267
What do you think
she was doing there?

16:57.300 --> 16:59.167
I don't know.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.267
Looking for whales again.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.133
A bit secretive, your mum.

17:04.167 --> 17:06.733
A bit sly, the Jacksons.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.300
Anyway...

17:15.833 --> 17:17.667
..it doesn't look
too good, Abby.

17:19.633 --> 17:21.867
They said she might
not speak again.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.667
We'll see about that.

17:29.567 --> 17:31.733
So what do you reckon?

17:31.767 --> 17:33.933
Check out the abalone guy?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.800
The compressor's on.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.567
He must be under the water.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.700
Mum, you can't just get
in someone's boat uninvited.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.767
He's taking too many.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.767
That's like
breaking into someone's house.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.767
Yeah, he's got a licence.
He knows the rules.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.300
-Macka!

18:04.333 --> 18:05.533
-Hey, Macka!

18:05.567 --> 18:07.433
Come on, ya old dog!

18:07.467 --> 18:08.967
Macka!

18:16.833 --> 18:20.567
Dora, what in the living hell
are you doing?

18:20.600 --> 18:22.000
You right there?

18:22.033 --> 18:23.600
Give a man
a heart attack, you will.

18:23.633 --> 18:26.433
Sorry to board
your vessel uninvited, Macka.

18:26.467 --> 18:29.067
Oh, you don't look too sorry.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.433
You're taking too many.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.800
I mean, you know how long
they take to grow.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.933
You're gonna strip this bay
in no time if you keep this up.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.567
It's not
as bad as it looks.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.067
It's pretty
simple, really.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.967
Well, I'm a simple bloke

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
so that's the best news
I've heard all day.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.033
Now, are you the sheriff
or the deputy today?

18:48.067 --> 18:49.333
I think I'm the deputy.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.800
Anyway, I know this
looks a bit crook,

18:52.833 --> 18:54.633
but it's not as bad
as it seems, honestly.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.900
Some of this
stuff's from Henry's.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.500
-Mm-hm.
-Some of it is from the Bluffs.

18:57.533 --> 18:59.967
It's a full day's work there.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Yeah, alright.
Shouldn't they be on ice, then?

19:02.033 --> 19:04.867
Yeah, it should be on ice.
We should all be on ice.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.167
I'm getting a bit sweaty
in my wetty.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.100
-On a day like this?
-Yeah.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.100
How is the water?

19:12.133 --> 19:14.800
It's up about a degree,
a degree and a half, I reckon.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.633
-Jeez.
-Sure is warm.

19:16.667 --> 19:21.133
Righto, if you two
high-sea bandits are finished,

19:21.167 --> 19:23.067
I've got some
gastropods to harvest,

19:23.100 --> 19:25.133
in a sustainable manner,
of course,

19:25.167 --> 19:28.800
in line with all the relevant
health and safety protocols.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
-He can be a bit rough.
-I like him.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.533
-He's not that scary.
-OK.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.633
Mrs Jackson.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.133
Ted Costello.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.267
Wonderful view.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.767
Well, Ted Costello,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it

19:59.800 --> 20:02.500
just as much from the car
on your way home.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.200
I'm just here
to drop off a proposal.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.033
I left it on your kitchen table.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.700
Door was open. I called out.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.333
We don't normally need
to lock our doors around here.

20:19.367 --> 20:23.733
Doesn't mean we expect people
to just walk in uninvited.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.533
Worth taking a look.

20:27.467 --> 20:30.067
-No rush, though.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.533
We're not going anywhere.

20:32.933 --> 20:34.800
Your neighbours
all seem very interested.

20:43.767 --> 20:45.500
We're here, Abby.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.433
You want me to come in?

20:49.467 --> 20:51.300
Thanks, Briggs.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.833
I can take it from here.

20:53.867 --> 20:56.200
What happens if they won't
let you take her home?

20:57.400 --> 21:01.200
Well, I feel sorry for the fella
that says no to you.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.500
Come on, sleepy head.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.333
I'm gonna take you home.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.067
Mum?

21:33.467 --> 21:34.933
It's me.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.100
Here.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.000
Hey.

22:22.233 --> 22:23.433
Come on.

22:27.767 --> 22:30.367
I figured
you might need some supplies.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.567
Thanks.

22:37.400 --> 22:41.233
I...I guess I'll leave you two
villains up to your mischief.

22:42.167 --> 22:43.400
OK.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.900
Mum.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.067
Do you remember the drawings?

25:09.333 --> 25:11.500
This was my first.

25:13.433 --> 25:15.267
Mum?

26:30.100 --> 26:31.733
See ya.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.733
And here she is.

26:38.767 --> 26:41.400
Seven minutes late. New record.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.567
Come on. Come on!
Time to make up.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.067
Been getting many
fish out there?

26:50.100 --> 26:52.900
Yeah, some here
and there. You know how it is.

26:52.933 --> 26:54.733
Like where, for instance?

26:54.767 --> 26:56.433
Fish are where
you find 'em, Merv.

26:56.467 --> 26:58.267
Right!

26:58.300 --> 27:00.300
You Jacksons, I tell ya,

27:00.333 --> 27:02.167
the old apple don't fall
far from the tree.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.667
You gotta give my love to Dora.

27:27.267 --> 27:28.400
-G'day, Merv.
-Morning.

27:28.433 --> 27:29.867
-Hi, Merv.
-Morning, Merv.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.200
-G'day, Briggs.
-Hey.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.567
-Morning, lads.
-Morning, Merv.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.200
Come on, kids. Let's go!

27:50.400 --> 27:51.800
Any ideas?

27:51.833 --> 27:53.633
Yeah, it's a banksia.

27:53.667 --> 27:56.633
I've seen this one
growing down Wilder's Road too.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.200
There's heaps down my place.

27:58.233 --> 28:00.033
Red. Blue. Yellow.

28:00.067 --> 28:02.767
It's a Banksia attenuata,

28:02.800 --> 28:06.200
or 'biara' as it's known in
the local Indigenous language.

28:07.133 --> 28:08.900
Go on. Try and draw it.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.833
Briggs! Abby!

28:14.800 --> 28:15.967
Wait here.

28:29.467 --> 28:31.333
What's going on?

28:31.367 --> 28:33.433
The entry to the bay
is too shallow.

28:33.467 --> 28:35.300
They need to dredge the reef,

28:35.333 --> 28:37.933
create an entry point
for larger boats.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.300
Mum said
they need to pass

28:40.333 --> 28:41.500
an environmental assessment.

28:41.533 --> 28:43.567
The development
isn't even approved yet.

28:43.600 --> 28:46.533
I don't think they're worried
about needing an approval.

28:50.267 --> 28:52.433
Where are you going?

28:52.467 --> 28:54.633
-Abby!
-See ya, Merv!

28:54.667 --> 28:57.900
Oi! What am I
supposed to tell your mum?

28:57.933 --> 29:00.267
Wait for me.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.200
-Hi, Mum!

29:16.233 --> 29:18.200
Hey. Good day at school?

29:31.300 --> 29:34.433
The salmon's in, at last.

29:38.567 --> 29:39.900
Here you go.

29:39.933 --> 29:41.633
Yeah, alright.
Thanks, love.

29:49.033 --> 29:50.333
-Hey, Dad.
-G'day, mate.

29:50.367 --> 29:51.700
-Abby.
-Hey.

29:51.733 --> 29:53.700
Come on.
I'm gonna show you something.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.000
Don't be late!

30:14.033 --> 30:15.867
It's a blue whale.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.633
The biggest animal
on the planet.

30:22.567 --> 30:25.100
This was just a calf, I think.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.033
They must get pretty big, hey?

30:34.733 --> 30:36.467
Dad said
there were whalers here.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.100
Like, way back.

30:39.133 --> 30:40.667
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:42.700 --> 30:46.467
There used to be so many whales,
you could walk across them.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.867
Blues, humpbacks, right whales.

30:50.867 --> 30:52.200
Have you seen one?

30:56.200 --> 30:58.800
Sort of. Not really.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.500
Just like a white puff
in the distance.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.833
Dad says we're killing
a big hole in the world,

31:06.867 --> 31:08.667
all of us...

31:09.800 --> 31:11.900
..and we're all gonna
fall into it together.

31:11.933 --> 31:13.933
You sure he hasn't
been talking to my mum?

31:13.967 --> 31:15.333
I'd like to see that.

31:15.367 --> 31:16.433
Yeah.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.500
So we were just about
to send out a search party.

31:25.533 --> 31:29.200
Sorry, Mrs Jackson. Hey, Dad.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.533
Got the heads-up from Merv
you might be down here.

31:31.567 --> 31:33.200
Sorry, OK?

31:33.233 --> 31:35.967
Briggs just wanted to
show me something. That's all.

31:37.700 --> 31:40.700
Well, the good news is...

31:40.733 --> 31:42.300
..we get a free feed.

31:42.333 --> 31:45.100
-Yeah?
-We've been invited to dinner.

31:45.133 --> 31:46.800
Huh!

32:00.633 --> 32:02.000
Hey, Jimmy!

32:12.400 --> 32:13.933
Abby!

32:15.033 --> 32:18.567
Hey, I saw you today
from my boat.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.733
You were down by the blue whale.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.467
You were with a fella.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.400
-Hey, Macka?
-Yeah?

32:27.433 --> 32:30.133
I assume you've
been invited, yeah?

32:33.800 --> 32:36.333
Well, I can see the flame
from a mile away.

32:36.367 --> 32:39.100
That's an official invitation,
isn't it, hey?

32:39.133 --> 32:42.300
Besides, they'll be glad I came.
The fun's getting started now.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.367
Good one, Merv!

32:43.400 --> 32:44.833
-Whoa! Hey!
-Oh, Macka!

32:46.433 --> 32:47.667
What's going on?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.833
What's going on, kids?
What have we got here?

32:49.867 --> 32:51.900
What have we got here?
Ten-ball shooter!

32:51.933 --> 32:54.667
-Thanks, Macka!

32:54.700 --> 32:56.200
Ooh!

32:56.233 --> 32:59.033
There we go.
Point it upwards, OK?

33:01.067 --> 33:03.067
Nah, next year.

33:03.100 --> 33:04.867
Aww!

33:06.900 --> 33:08.367
-Macka.
-Oh!

33:13.000 --> 33:14.600
Hey, hey, hey! Here we go!

33:29.000 --> 33:31.400
-That's so cool!
-Another one!

33:37.100 --> 33:38.367
Briggs, hey!

33:44.467 --> 33:46.800
-Yeah, baby!

33:48.667 --> 33:50.367
Here we go, everyone!

34:12.533 --> 34:14.167
Here we go!

34:19.300 --> 34:21.067
Your mum's
a good dancer.

34:24.233 --> 34:27.933
Yeah, Merv too, hey?

34:30.600 --> 34:31.833
You think
he likes her?

34:33.500 --> 34:35.300
Sorry.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.767
That was a bit
thoughtless of me.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.467
No, no problem with me,
Briggs. It's fine.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.133
Everyone loved your dad.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.800
That's what my old man says.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.400
He was
a pearl diver, right?

34:57.367 --> 35:01.833
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.533
He headed north for
the pearl season every year.

35:05.633 --> 35:07.367
Mum said he could
come back with, like,

35:07.400 --> 35:09.400
a year's money
in just a few months.

35:10.467 --> 35:13.733
But, I mean, he hated it.

35:14.667 --> 35:16.500
He worked so hard

35:16.533 --> 35:18.833
just to make a life for us.

35:19.833 --> 35:23.633
And then one year...

35:23.667 --> 35:25.100
..one year came around

35:25.133 --> 35:28.300
when he just didn't
come home after the season.

35:29.900 --> 35:34.367
They found his mask
at the bottom of Roebuck Bay.

35:35.833 --> 35:38.233
They just never found his body.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.200
So the sea took him?

35:42.200 --> 35:44.200
A tiger shark most likely.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.033
I mean, that's what they said.

36:10.133 --> 36:13.167
Really? Not a word?

36:16.367 --> 36:19.500
You are so damn stubborn.

36:38.033 --> 36:39.700
OK.

36:40.767 --> 36:43.433
What have we here?

36:44.433 --> 36:46.200
A letter from
the prime minister

36:46.233 --> 36:50.700
and a copy
of your letter to him.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.300
You're being way too polite.

36:55.367 --> 36:57.567
My personal favourite.

37:01.267 --> 37:03.167
Did you get any takers?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.533
OK. One last thing.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.233
The dolphin,

37:09.267 --> 37:11.300
from the protest.

37:17.167 --> 37:18.667
Remember this?

37:20.133 --> 37:22.033
Mum! Seriously!

37:26.000 --> 37:27.600
I was a coward.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.033
It killed me.

37:32.067 --> 37:34.100
Save our bay!

37:34.133 --> 37:35.600
-You can breathe?
-Yeah.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.133
It's not too tight?

37:37.167 --> 37:38.633
Yeah, that's it, Merv.

37:38.667 --> 37:41.167
-You can't get free?
-No, it's good, mate.

37:46.867 --> 37:48.500
Save our homes!

37:48.533 --> 37:50.267
Save our bay!

37:50.300 --> 37:53.267
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

37:53.300 --> 37:54.800
OK, we're in. It's done.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.567
What do you want me
to do with this?

37:56.600 --> 37:58.367
-Eat it, Merv.
-I'm not eating it. I'm not.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.267
Take it to the ocean,
chuck it in.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.633
OK.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.900
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

38:03.933 --> 38:05.567
Run, Merv! Run!

38:07.633 --> 38:09.433
-Come on, Dora.

38:09.467 --> 38:11.267
You've had your fun.
This is pointless.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.867
You know
what's in this truck?

38:12.900 --> 38:14.667
-What?
-Ammonium nitrate.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.133
That's what's in it.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.733
It's your bay too, mate!

38:17.767 --> 38:19.300
-Settle down!
-Save our bay!

38:19.333 --> 38:24.033
Save our bay!
Save our bay! Save our bay!

38:24.067 --> 38:28.833
Save our bay! Save our bay!
Save our bay!

38:28.867 --> 38:30.667
Save our bay!

38:30.700 --> 38:33.567
Save our bay!
Save our bay!

38:45.633 --> 38:47.900
-Thanks, Ray.
-See you.

38:47.933 --> 38:50.433
Say hi to the missus
for me, will you?

38:50.467 --> 38:52.133
Will do.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.300
Hey.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.733
You were there today?

39:08.733 --> 39:10.367
At the protest?

39:11.467 --> 39:13.100
You know I was there.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.633
No, I didn't.

39:15.933 --> 39:18.633
-Must have been hiding, yeah?
-No, I was there.

39:18.667 --> 39:22.300
When it comes to standing up
for what you believe,

39:22.333 --> 39:24.667
there is no place
for cowards, Abby.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.067
I'm not a coward, Mum!

39:26.100 --> 39:28.000
Yeah? It didn't seem
that way to me.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.300
I'm not a coward!

39:29.333 --> 39:30.833
And your dad
would've agreed with me!

39:30.867 --> 39:33.133
Well, that's real mature,
bringing Dad into this!

40:05.800 --> 40:07.300
Hey, Mum.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.133
I just came to say
that I'm sorry.

40:18.033 --> 40:20.133
Day's not over yet.

40:22.367 --> 40:25.400
Should we go find
the old blue bandit?

40:27.033 --> 40:29.267
-Yeah.
-Come on, bub. Come on.

40:30.733 --> 40:32.767
-I'm sorry too.
-It's all good.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.667
-You alright?
-Don't worry about it.

43:07.667 --> 43:10.367
Do you reckon we can get her
out on the open water again?

43:11.500 --> 43:14.133
I'm not so sure.

43:14.167 --> 43:16.600
Come on. You used to be
able to fix anything.

43:17.867 --> 43:19.733
I can give it a try.

43:19.767 --> 43:22.133
Do you think you might
go to Robber's Head?

43:24.933 --> 43:26.633
I'm not sure if I'm up for that.

43:36.133 --> 43:39.267
Hey, you reckon we should
do a quick check-up on Macka?

43:39.300 --> 43:40.867
Yeah.

43:46.900 --> 43:48.333
Hey, Macka!

43:49.333 --> 43:50.900
Hooroo!

43:52.167 --> 43:53.500
-Look out!
-Hello.

43:53.533 --> 43:54.967
Ducks on the pond.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.533
Oh, pirate ducks at that.

43:56.567 --> 43:57.900
Hey, you know
those fireworks

43:57.933 --> 43:59.267
you had the other night, yeah?

43:59.300 --> 44:00.767
I think they're
actually illegal.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.867
Oh, no! You gonna
call the authorities?

44:04.900 --> 44:06.200
I was thinking about it.

44:06.233 --> 44:07.467
How you doing down there, Macka?

44:07.500 --> 44:09.300
I was going OK
till I had a visitor.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.967
Oh, well, if that's how
you feel, we can just leave.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.400
Nah, I'm not talking about you.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.433
I'm talking about a man
in a sharp grey suit.

44:15.467 --> 44:17.433
A shark?
What kind of shark?

44:17.467 --> 44:19.967
Well, the kind you
step out of the dance for,

44:20.000 --> 44:21.333
if you know what I mean,

44:21.367 --> 44:23.167
discretion being
the better part of valour.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.467
A great white.

44:24.500 --> 44:27.567
Pretty great,
pretty white, pretty big.

44:28.533 --> 44:29.933
With all this fresh meat
lying around,

44:29.967 --> 44:31.600
I didn't want to tempt him.

44:31.633 --> 44:34.500
Didn't want to, uh, put his
good manners to the test.

44:34.533 --> 44:37.233
They say I'm a bit tapped,
ladies, but I'm not that mad.

44:37.267 --> 44:39.367
Seems pretty sensible, Macka.

44:39.400 --> 44:41.100
Oh, look out.
Mum's agreeing with me.

44:41.133 --> 44:43.233
-"Dear diary," hey?

44:43.267 --> 44:44.933
Before you go...

44:46.300 --> 44:48.967
..they tell me
that this is the favourite

44:49.000 --> 44:51.033
of the old Achoerodus gouldii.

44:51.067 --> 44:53.100
I beg your pardon,
the what?

44:53.133 --> 44:55.967
Groper, western blue.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.267
Scoffs my popcorn apparently.

44:58.300 --> 44:59.767
We don't catch groper.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.767
Well, most people don't.
Can't say I do myself.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.567
Well, then,
what are the crabs for?

45:04.600 --> 45:05.867
Well, because every old man

45:05.900 --> 45:08.033
likes a snack
every now and then, Dora.

45:08.067 --> 45:09.900
You know about Blueback,
don't ya?

45:10.867 --> 45:12.067
Blueback?

45:13.300 --> 45:15.033
That's a nice name.

45:16.100 --> 45:18.367
Righto, if you
reprobates are finished,

45:18.400 --> 45:19.733
I'm gonna go finish off

45:19.767 --> 45:21.833
this beautiful little snack
I prepared for myself,

45:21.867 --> 45:23.533
and then I'm gonna go...

45:23.567 --> 45:25.600
..back in and check
if old mate's still around.

45:25.633 --> 45:28.700
Come on, mate. Why don't you
just get your boat out of here?

45:28.733 --> 45:30.333
Take it out west somewhere.

45:30.367 --> 45:33.467
I'm big enough and old enough
to look after myself.

45:33.500 --> 45:35.367
Besides, I've always thought
when the time's right

45:35.400 --> 45:37.300
for that sort of thing,
the time's right.

45:37.333 --> 45:39.467
Know what I mean?

45:39.500 --> 45:41.300
No point worrying about
things you can't control.

45:41.333 --> 45:43.167
Isn't that right, Abby?

45:44.333 --> 45:45.767
Yeah.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.800
Righto, back to work.

45:52.300 --> 45:54.000
Take care, Macka.

45:54.033 --> 45:56.433
-Hooroo.
-Hooroo!

46:02.933 --> 46:05.200
Looks like
we've had visitors again...

46:07.433 --> 46:10.233
..laying out their
surveyor's posts.

46:11.467 --> 46:14.700
Planning out where
they're gonna build

46:14.733 --> 46:17.267
when we finally give in.

46:18.633 --> 46:22.000
Well...not today.

46:24.633 --> 46:25.933
Bye-bye!

46:25.967 --> 46:29.633
Yeah. That's the end
of that, then.

46:34.667 --> 46:36.167
What are you reading?

46:38.333 --> 46:41.467
Um, it's a marine encyclopedia.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.667
Mr Carlisle lent it to me.

46:44.667 --> 46:46.200
To prepare for the new school.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.700
Western blue groper.

46:49.733 --> 46:52.267
Achoerodus gouldii?

46:52.300 --> 46:53.433
Yeah.

46:53.467 --> 46:55.100
A leafy seadragon.

46:55.133 --> 46:57.300
A Phycodurus...

46:57.333 --> 46:59.033
..a Phycodurus eques.

46:59.067 --> 47:02.067
What kind of a name is it
if you can't even say it?

47:03.300 --> 47:06.133
And the southern rock lobster,

47:06.167 --> 47:09.100
Jasus ed...edwardsii.

47:11.967 --> 47:14.833
So Briggs said the salmon
didn't come in on time?

47:14.867 --> 47:17.467
Yeah, I spoke to Merv
the other day.

47:17.500 --> 47:19.300
Yeah?

47:19.333 --> 47:21.400
He said that
the sardines are dead

47:21.433 --> 47:23.667
all the way down the coast.

47:23.700 --> 47:27.500
And a dead leopard seal
came in from Antarctica.

47:27.533 --> 47:30.567
So there's something going on.

47:32.700 --> 47:34.833
You'd think
there'd be some way to,

47:34.867 --> 47:36.600
you know, read all these signs.

47:36.633 --> 47:38.333
It's a puzzle.

47:39.333 --> 47:40.733
With an answer?

47:41.767 --> 47:43.633
Yeah, there's always an answer.

47:51.167 --> 47:52.867
Storm's coming.

48:01.167 --> 48:02.600
Hey, Mum!

48:09.200 --> 48:11.900
Macka's still out diving.
He should come in.

48:11.933 --> 48:13.267
Let me see.

48:13.300 --> 48:15.367
I think
the compressor's stopped.

48:19.767 --> 48:21.267
Abby, come on.

48:29.867 --> 48:32.933
-Macka! Macka!

48:32.967 --> 48:34.667
Macka?

48:36.500 --> 48:37.867
The compressor's low on fuel.

48:37.900 --> 48:40.133
-Reckon you can get it going?
-Yeah, I think so.

48:40.167 --> 48:42.533
Macka? Macka?

48:50.533 --> 48:55.067
Do not get in the water, Abby.
Stay on the boat.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.700
-You understand?
-Do you think it's a shark?

48:57.733 --> 48:59.533
Stay on the boat.

49:04.300 --> 49:06.600
-Come on!

49:06.633 --> 49:08.333
Come on, please!

49:08.367 --> 49:09.667
Come on!

49:33.200 --> 49:35.433
Won't be needing that.

49:41.967 --> 49:43.433
Was it that shark?

49:45.233 --> 49:47.033
No, he's just floating
along the bottom.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.700
I reckon he's had
a heart attack.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.267
So he's dead?

50:01.233 --> 50:02.867
Yeah, love.

50:05.367 --> 50:06.667
He's drowned.

50:13.567 --> 50:15.367
I'm sorry.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.800
This isn't gonna
be nice, but, um...

50:20.867 --> 50:23.833
..I want you to
tie off that rope.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.467
I'll go down and secure him

50:27.500 --> 50:29.300
and when I come back up,

50:29.333 --> 50:31.867
we're both gonna have to pull.

50:51.233 --> 50:53.200
OK, alright.

50:53.233 --> 50:56.100
Thanks for checking. OK. Bye.

51:53.700 --> 51:55.700
Oh, Mum...

52:08.367 --> 52:09.800
Gitundu.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.300
Hi, Abby.

52:11.333 --> 52:13.033
How's your mum?

52:13.067 --> 52:14.500
OK.

52:14.533 --> 52:17.067
Not great, but it's good
to be here with her.

52:18.033 --> 52:19.867
And the reef?
Any news from the survey?

52:21.100 --> 52:22.933
That's why I'm calling.

52:23.900 --> 52:26.200
The drones came in
this afternoon.

52:26.233 --> 52:27.933
The bleaching...

52:27.967 --> 52:29.900
Miles of it.

52:30.833 --> 52:33.267
More than we ever predicted.

52:33.300 --> 52:35.233
It's dying.

52:35.267 --> 52:37.333
The whole reef will be gone.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.300
We really need you here.

52:45.300 --> 52:47.100
When are you coming back?

52:47.133 --> 52:48.700
I'm not sure.

52:50.233 --> 52:52.000
About anything.

52:53.367 --> 52:55.033
Abby?

52:59.233 --> 53:01.167
Sorry, Gitundu.

54:29.133 --> 54:33.367
So I saw these amazing
leafy seadragons

54:33.400 --> 54:35.300
down at the point yesterday.

54:35.333 --> 54:37.033
Mm?

54:37.067 --> 54:38.933
Never seen them before.

54:41.500 --> 54:45.400
Oh, come on, Jackson!
Let's get wet. Come on.

54:45.433 --> 54:48.100
Come on! Your new school
can wait.

55:46.767 --> 55:49.367
That's a reef stripper
if ever I've seen one.

55:50.300 --> 55:52.400
They have the abalone licence.

55:52.433 --> 55:54.433
Poor old Macka's
only just left us.

55:56.667 --> 55:58.933
We need to keep
an eye on Robber's Head.

55:58.967 --> 56:02.200
Blueback, he...
he's a big target.

56:02.233 --> 56:04.433
Yeah, I'm gonna
have a word with them.

56:04.467 --> 56:06.233
With a boat that size,

56:06.267 --> 56:09.000
they should be fishing
in open water.

56:14.133 --> 56:18.200
This is the most stupid and
dangerous thing we could do.

56:18.233 --> 56:21.967
You told me, Mum, "To do nothing
would be twice as stupid

56:22.000 --> 56:23.400
"and twice as dangerous."

56:24.400 --> 56:26.067
True.

56:52.100 --> 56:53.833
Abby!

57:04.167 --> 57:06.000
Hey, Mum, come up here.

57:12.567 --> 57:14.333
It's not just abalone.

57:14.367 --> 57:16.733
And so many undersized ones.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.167
It's hard
to be discerning

57:18.200 --> 57:19.833
when you're stripping a reef.

57:21.633 --> 57:24.133
And these fish...

57:24.167 --> 57:26.667
Some of them are
meant to be protected.

57:26.700 --> 57:28.267
How can they do this, Mum?

57:29.833 --> 57:33.000
I'm gonna go down and see
what they're doing down there.

57:34.767 --> 57:37.633
I want you to stay on our boat.
You understand, Abby?

57:37.667 --> 57:40.700
'Cause some of these fish
have been speared.

59:22.533 --> 59:24.733
-Bring it up.

59:26.833 --> 59:28.500
Bring it on.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.667
-Mrs Jackson.
-Costello!

59:32.700 --> 59:34.567
I thought you'd have
something to do with this.

59:34.600 --> 59:37.400
You're drag-netting
open-water style.

59:37.433 --> 59:40.833
You're gonna fish
the reef out completely!

59:40.867 --> 59:43.433
You don't want to talk about
it? No, didn't think you would.

59:43.467 --> 59:46.133
-Don't worry about her.
-Maybe your guys do. Guys?

59:46.167 --> 59:48.400
Do you realise exactly
what you're doing here?

59:48.433 --> 59:50.033
Just ignore her.

59:50.067 --> 59:51.667
You're gonna strip this
entire ecosystem...

59:52.867 --> 59:54.367
..of marine life, so your boss

59:54.400 --> 59:56.200
can push his agenda
through council.

59:57.233 --> 59:59.433
So why don't we talk
about spear guns?

59:59.467 --> 1:00:01.933
There's a whole range
of protected species here.

1:00:01.967 --> 1:00:04.500
Any of you blockheads
know which ones they are?

1:00:04.533 --> 1:00:06.733
No? Didn't think so.

1:00:06.767 --> 1:00:09.633
Well, I'd be asking
my boss if I were you.

1:00:09.667 --> 1:00:11.767
Hey, Mum, there's someone
on Macka's boat.

1:00:13.667 --> 1:00:15.600
Alright. Let's get out
of here. Come on.

1:00:15.633 --> 1:00:17.333
Sleazebag.

1:00:22.167 --> 1:00:23.667
Hey.

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:26.900
What were you doing
on Macka's boat?

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:31.400
That boat's still good
in open water?

1:00:31.433 --> 1:00:33.500
Yeah, sure is.

1:00:33.533 --> 1:00:35.467
Smooth as, even in a storm.

1:00:35.500 --> 1:00:37.367
Even in a storm.

1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:39.000
-You feel safe on it?
-Yeah.

1:00:39.033 --> 1:00:41.600
The man who owned it
took it out every day.

1:00:43.467 --> 1:00:44.867
What was he like?

1:00:46.200 --> 1:00:47.900
The man that
took it out every day?

1:00:50.067 --> 1:00:51.467
Well, his name was Macka.

1:00:52.433 --> 1:00:54.833
And people called him Mad Macka.

1:00:56.833 --> 1:00:58.600
Maybe I did too.

1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:01.333
But I liked him.

1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:03.900
Abby?

1:01:05.067 --> 1:01:08.133
Why don't you head back up
and get the meal going?

1:01:08.167 --> 1:01:11.067
I'll...I'll deal with this.

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:21.533
She helped me
pull him up.

1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:25.367
Big thing for anyone,
seeing death for the first time.

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:27.867
Well, I'm grateful
for what you both did.

1:01:28.933 --> 1:01:30.467
Did you know Macka?

1:01:33.300 --> 1:01:34.800
He was my dad.

1:01:40.133 --> 1:01:41.633
Abby!

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:45.567
It's yours.

1:01:47.533 --> 1:01:49.067
He would've loved
you to have it.

1:02:21.267 --> 1:02:23.200
Are you really sure
that I can have it?

1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:25.967
Macka's son. He said you could.

1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.367
Oh, wow!
What do you reckon?

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:39.133
That's an engine, alright.

1:02:39.167 --> 1:02:42.733
Alright? A bit rusty, but we
could work on it together.

1:02:42.767 --> 1:02:44.933
Make it feel like yours, then.

1:02:47.733 --> 1:02:49.233
Oh, yeah.

1:02:50.467 --> 1:02:52.767
-I can't wait.

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:55.333
OK, where are the tools?

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:00.333
Abby?

1:03:02.333 --> 1:03:03.633
Hey?

1:03:03.667 --> 1:03:05.367
Here. Look.

1:03:24.867 --> 1:03:27.867
-Is that his son?
-Yeah.

1:03:27.900 --> 1:03:29.600
Looks just like him.

1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:42.167
Do you know that the sea holds
more artefacts and remnants

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:45.433
of our history then all
the museums in the world?

1:03:46.533 --> 1:03:48.800
And Mad Macka
has most of them in here.

1:03:50.033 --> 1:03:51.467
What's this?

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:52.800
Careful.

1:03:54.700 --> 1:03:56.900
Oh! It's an otolith.

1:03:58.033 --> 1:03:59.700
I've only seen a picture of one.

1:04:00.667 --> 1:04:02.133
What is it?

1:04:02.167 --> 1:04:03.933
It's a skeleton
of an ear.

1:04:06.267 --> 1:04:07.867
The ear of a blue groper.

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:12.267
See? Here are the lines
along it, yeah?

1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:14.033
-There?
-Yeah.

1:04:15.467 --> 1:04:17.833
Well, it grows
a layer each year.

1:04:19.833 --> 1:04:21.433
You can tell how old it is.

1:04:22.867 --> 1:04:24.233
He was really old.

1:04:24.267 --> 1:04:26.300
Like, really old.

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:28.867
How do you know
that he was a he?

1:04:32.533 --> 1:04:37.133
Well, you see, all blue gropers
are born as girls...

1:04:38.167 --> 1:04:39.700
..and they start off green.

1:04:40.900 --> 1:04:44.667
And it's only when puberty hits
that they change colour

1:04:44.700 --> 1:04:46.600
and some of them become boys.

1:05:10.267 --> 1:05:12.000
I want to show you something.

1:05:14.033 --> 1:05:16.533
Someone, actually.

1:05:16.567 --> 1:05:18.633
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:05:18.667 --> 1:05:20.333
Alright. Come on.

1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:28.067
Now, the throttle
will flood the engine

1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:29.733
if you're too hard
on the old girl.

1:05:29.767 --> 1:05:31.200
-You feel that?
-Like this?

1:05:31.233 --> 1:05:33.767
-That's it. You got it.

1:05:34.800 --> 1:05:36.300
Yeah.

1:05:44.233 --> 1:05:45.733
Come on.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.433
What'd you think?

1:07:34.467 --> 1:07:36.533
Oh, that was amazing.

1:07:36.567 --> 1:07:38.100
So cool!

1:07:39.133 --> 1:07:40.833
Hey, Mum, you alright?

1:07:40.867 --> 1:07:43.267
Yeah.
I'm gonna head home.

1:07:43.300 --> 1:07:46.433
I gotta figure out
what Costello's next move is.

1:07:47.567 --> 1:07:49.833
I'm gonna
see you back at the house.

1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:53.800
-Before sunset this time, yeah?
-OK, yeah.

1:08:15.433 --> 1:08:17.900
Doesn't look like
they've started dredging yet.

1:08:17.933 --> 1:08:20.233
Maybe the protests
slowed them down.

1:08:34.867 --> 1:08:36.667
Just make sure
everyone's there in the morning,

1:08:36.700 --> 1:08:38.233
all the machinery's ready to go,

1:08:38.267 --> 1:08:40.467
and I'll see you after the
council meeting, if not before.

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.300
Yeah, no worries.
See you in the morning.

1:08:54.167 --> 1:08:56.000
I think she looks better.

1:08:56.033 --> 1:08:58.267
Yeah, well, happier.

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:01.067
She still hasn't
said a word, though.

1:09:01.100 --> 1:09:04.433
The doctor said the chance of
another stroke is so high now.

1:09:04.467 --> 1:09:05.667
Yeah, I know.

1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:07.633
That's it's just
a matter of time.

1:09:08.933 --> 1:09:11.167
Time is all we have, Abby.

1:09:14.167 --> 1:09:17.267
I'm sorry it's been so long.

1:09:17.300 --> 1:09:21.267
There were my studies and all
the opportunities overseas...

1:09:21.300 --> 1:09:23.800
It's fine, Abby. We were fine.

1:09:23.833 --> 1:09:25.100
You know Dora.

1:09:25.133 --> 1:09:26.333
She kept us up to date

1:09:26.367 --> 1:09:27.700
with everything you were doing,

1:09:27.733 --> 1:09:29.367
you know,
read each letter out aloud.

1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:32.400
You know, she's very
proud of you. Very proud.

1:09:32.433 --> 1:09:35.267
We are very proud of you.

1:10:15.733 --> 1:10:17.333
Hey, Dad.

1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:28.033
How you been?

1:10:35.167 --> 1:10:37.000
I'm worried.

1:10:41.133 --> 1:10:43.767
I don't know if Mum
can stop them this time.

1:10:46.533 --> 1:10:48.533
And I wish I knew how to help.

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:55.200
I really miss you.

1:11:14.233 --> 1:11:15.667
Mum.

1:11:24.133 --> 1:11:25.633
Well?

1:11:29.167 --> 1:11:30.500
Well...

1:11:30.533 --> 1:11:32.800
..I just need
to finish this proposal

1:11:32.833 --> 1:11:34.533
for the council tomorrow.

1:11:34.567 --> 1:11:36.233
Come on. What do you think?

1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:42.967
I think there's as good
a school as any right here.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.567
Well, yeah, but two years there
and I can head to university.

1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:47.600
It just...

1:11:47.633 --> 1:11:49.067
It feels like
you're trying to get

1:11:49.100 --> 1:11:51.367
as far away from me
as you can.

1:11:54.300 --> 1:11:55.733
Come on.
You know you can visit.

1:11:55.767 --> 1:11:57.567
Maybe live with me over there.

1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:00.467
If I leave here,
this house of ours

1:12:00.500 --> 1:12:03.900
will be bought by developers
and Costello will win.

1:12:03.933 --> 1:12:07.333
Look, I want to save
the world's oceans, Mum,

1:12:07.367 --> 1:12:09.833
and I can't learn everything
I need to at the school here.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:13.500
Abby, this is your home,
alright? You were born here.

1:12:13.533 --> 1:12:15.967
Your father was born here.
Your grandparents. I just...

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.067
I don't understand what
you think you're gonna do

1:12:18.100 --> 1:12:20.167
on the other side
of the world by yourself.

1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:21.833
Just come with me.

1:12:21.867 --> 1:12:25.567
You and me, we can make
a difference together.

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:32.333
Sweetheart, what do you think
I have been doing here

1:12:32.367 --> 1:12:35.267
my whole life?

1:12:51.067 --> 1:12:52.933
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1:12:52.967 --> 1:12:56.367
You look good.
The uniform, all of it.

1:12:59.333 --> 1:13:00.967
It's just...

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.667
It's really hard letting go.

1:14:33.933 --> 1:14:37.033
So I'm here to propose
a marine reserve

1:14:37.067 --> 1:14:39.367
to protect
the diversity of species

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.767
that we have right here
in this bay.

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:46.600
This diversity,
tell us about it.

1:14:46.633 --> 1:14:48.467
What threatens it?

1:14:50.167 --> 1:14:54.100
Well, I'm not...that good
at all this kind of talk.

1:14:55.133 --> 1:14:58.200
I live on the bay
so I've seen what's going on

1:14:58.233 --> 1:15:01.933
and right now,
there are men overfishing...

1:15:14.267 --> 1:15:15.800
Your mum still
banging on in there?

1:15:18.467 --> 1:15:19.633
I'm up next.

1:15:21.333 --> 1:15:22.967
That's how it works.

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:24.800
She speaks and then I get

1:15:24.833 --> 1:15:26.900
an equal chance
to argue my case.

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:29.233
Fair enough, don't you think?

1:15:29.267 --> 1:15:31.633
You and your mum really think
you can stop this.

1:15:31.667 --> 1:15:33.400
-Don't you?
-Yeah.

1:15:33.433 --> 1:15:35.233
That's not how it works.

1:15:35.267 --> 1:15:38.767
You see, governments, they pay
attention to short-term gains.

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:42.367
Jobs. Economic activity.

1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:44.700
They need to get re-elected.

1:15:49.733 --> 1:15:51.033
I'll vote.

1:15:52.333 --> 1:15:53.933
To stop them.

1:15:55.733 --> 1:15:57.400
To stop you.

1:16:01.467 --> 1:16:03.067
Not until you're 18.

1:16:14.167 --> 1:16:15.733
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1:16:15.767 --> 1:16:17.833
that's just stealing from...

1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:25.000
..stealing from our future.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:29.000
My name is Abby Jackson.

1:16:29.033 --> 1:16:31.100
Hello, Abby.

1:16:33.267 --> 1:16:34.933
And I'm 15 years old.

1:16:35.933 --> 1:16:38.400
I've been studying
this bay since I was 8.

1:16:39.867 --> 1:16:41.333
Since then,
I've been documenting

1:16:41.367 --> 1:16:43.667
the unique marine life
in the bay.

1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:46.433
This here is a redlip morwong.

1:16:46.467 --> 1:16:49.433
And there are three different
types of these seadragons,

1:16:49.467 --> 1:16:51.100
three,

1:16:51.133 --> 1:16:54.100
one of which is only found here,

1:16:54.133 --> 1:16:57.267
this incredibly rare
leafy seadragon.

1:16:57.300 --> 1:16:59.233
And each and every one of them

1:16:59.267 --> 1:17:01.900
is threatened by Costello's
planned development.

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:05.633
And we have larger fish,

1:17:05.667 --> 1:17:08.433
like the western blue groper,

1:17:08.467 --> 1:17:10.667
or Achoerodus gouldii.

1:17:11.767 --> 1:17:14.667
They just love
the moderate temperatures.

1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:16.833
They nestle here in...in reefs

1:17:16.867 --> 1:17:19.733
as havens from the weather
along the coastline.

1:17:23.133 --> 1:17:26.767
These pictures show us the many
species unique to this bay,

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:29.267
documented for the first time,

1:17:29.300 --> 1:17:32.867
the diversity of this
marine life, that it's a...

1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:35.167
I mean, it's a gift to us all.

1:17:36.167 --> 1:17:40.900
Well, we all welcome
your work, Abby,

1:17:40.933 --> 1:17:46.333
but do you believe that
we should make a decision today

1:17:46.367 --> 1:17:52.000
based on the, uh...
the drawings of a child?

1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:00.933
Hang on a minute, Abby.

1:18:25.700 --> 1:18:27.633
Down at Robber's Head!

1:19:01.433 --> 1:19:02.767
Abby?

1:19:07.667 --> 1:19:08.900
Abby?

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:34.300
Abby!

1:22:35.233 --> 1:22:36.667
Abby!

1:23:42.667 --> 1:23:44.200
You stupid girl!

1:23:44.233 --> 1:23:46.200
I told you to stay
out of the water!

1:23:46.233 --> 1:23:48.467
-They've got spear guns, Abby!
-I had to save him, Mum!

1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:50.400
-They could've killed ya!
-I had to save Blueback.

1:23:50.433 --> 1:23:51.933
-There was no other choice.
-Oh, Abby!

1:23:51.967 --> 1:23:54.167
He just wanted to play, Mum.

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:55.600
I was running out of air.

1:23:55.633 --> 1:23:57.267
Those men,
they wanted to kill him.

1:23:57.300 --> 1:23:59.600
So what happened?
Did he get away?

1:23:59.633 --> 1:24:01.500
Well...

1:24:01.533 --> 1:24:03.333
-Well?
-Well, I hit him one.

1:24:03.367 --> 1:24:06.800
I...I punched him, OK?
Just to scare him off.

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:10.800
Don't laugh, OK?

1:24:10.833 --> 1:24:12.500
-It's not funny.
-Oh, God.

1:24:12.533 --> 1:24:14.833
You know, he's probably got
some big black eye or something.

1:24:14.867 --> 1:24:17.400
Oh, get on the boat. Come on.

1:24:17.433 --> 1:24:19.767
He's gonna hate me now.
That's for sure.

1:24:20.767 --> 1:24:22.700
OK, so let's
start with the, uh...

1:24:22.733 --> 1:24:25.200
..with the spear guns
and the fact that that kid

1:24:25.233 --> 1:24:26.967
was nearly killed
by one of your blokes.

1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.233
Yeah, look,
I'm very disappointed

1:24:28.267 --> 1:24:29.433
about the spear guns.

1:24:29.467 --> 1:24:31.500
I didn't know these guys
were doing this.

1:24:31.533 --> 1:24:33.833
So what's gonna
happen now?

1:24:33.867 --> 1:24:36.400
Well, they breached
the fishing limits

1:24:36.433 --> 1:24:37.900
set by their licence.

1:24:37.933 --> 1:24:40.600
Turns out that spear guns

1:24:40.633 --> 1:24:43.000
aren't typically used
for fishing abalone

1:24:43.033 --> 1:24:47.033
and almost spearing
a teenage girl

1:24:47.067 --> 1:24:50.233
is...is reckless endangerment.

1:24:54.100 --> 1:24:55.700
And today?

1:24:56.633 --> 1:24:58.567
-How'd it go after I left?
-Well...

1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:02.100
There was six of them
that had to vote.

1:25:03.067 --> 1:25:06.300
Five of them
had hearts of stone.

1:25:06.333 --> 1:25:08.200
There was one, though.

1:25:08.233 --> 1:25:11.133
That woman from the
other side of Cockatoo Bay.

1:25:11.167 --> 1:25:12.433
Yeah?

1:25:13.700 --> 1:25:15.267
She saw the sense in it.

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:20.767
It was you that did it, Abby.

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:22.200
Not me.

1:25:22.233 --> 1:25:23.667
It was your pictures.

1:25:24.633 --> 1:25:26.367
Your research.

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:27.867
Just one vote?

1:25:27.900 --> 1:25:29.567
Oh...

1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.167
Just one for now.

1:25:32.333 --> 1:25:35.567
Next time two, then another,

1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:37.900
then another,

1:25:37.933 --> 1:25:39.400
then another...

1:26:05.067 --> 1:26:06.367
They're here.

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.467
Where's Dora?

1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:10.667
Dora! Dora, come on,
come on. Dora!

1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.367
-See 'em?
-Yeah.

1:26:26.667 --> 1:26:28.167
Thank you.

1:26:30.767 --> 1:26:34.100
Ahh, yeah, yeah,
there's about eight of them.

1:26:34.133 --> 1:26:36.300
Humpbacks!

1:26:36.333 --> 1:26:37.967
New babies too.

1:26:39.133 --> 1:26:42.267
Mrs J, is that why you were
down at Robber's Head?

1:26:42.300 --> 1:26:44.367
'Cause you were waiting
for this mob to come through?

1:26:44.400 --> 1:26:46.367
Patient as ever.

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:49.867
And you know
the best place to view 'em?

1:26:50.833 --> 1:26:51.933
Right here.

1:26:53.367 --> 1:26:56.533
Alright, Mrs J, let's have
a look for some more.

1:26:56.567 --> 1:26:59.200
I reckon there's a few
out there lingering.

1:27:01.633 --> 1:27:04.733
Whoa! Oh, look at that!

1:27:05.967 --> 1:27:08.133
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:06.333
You kept them, Mum.

1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:08.833
Where were they?

1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:18.333
He never came back, did he, Mum?

1:28:22.933 --> 1:28:24.567
I saved him sure enough.

1:28:25.533 --> 1:28:27.267
But I never saw him again.

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:30.833
I truly believed
he would have shared

1:28:30.867 --> 1:28:32.967
the secrets
of the sea with me...

1:28:34.467 --> 1:28:36.267
..if only he'd come back.

1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:50.700
Come on.

1:30:13.833 --> 1:30:15.833
When you were born...

1:30:16.900 --> 1:30:19.767
..we took you down
while the water was warm...

1:30:20.767 --> 1:30:23.533
..and lowered you gently
into the waves.

1:30:26.067 --> 1:30:27.767
Jack and me.

1:30:28.867 --> 1:30:31.900
We couldn't keep
you out of the water.

1:30:40.767 --> 1:30:43.267
We come from water.

1:30:51.133 --> 1:30:53.167
We belong to it, Abby.

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:01.900
What if
he doesn't come back?

1:31:02.900 --> 1:31:05.400
If I never see him again, hey?

1:31:05.433 --> 1:31:07.700
Well, you saved him, Abby.

1:31:07.733 --> 1:31:09.867
That's the main thing.

1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:13.100
If that's the cost,
then it was worth it.

1:31:16.467 --> 1:31:20.800
You ever notice that
just before the sun sets,

1:31:20.833 --> 1:31:22.767
beyond the horizon...

1:31:24.233 --> 1:31:28.300
..the sun burns even brighter
just for an instant,

1:31:28.333 --> 1:31:30.800
lights up the whole sky?

1:31:34.167 --> 1:31:36.233
Yeah, it does.

1:31:39.233 --> 1:31:42.900
One last beautiful hurrah.

1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:46.900
Then it's gone.

1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:04.233
We are
gathered here today,

1:32:04.267 --> 1:32:07.533
looking out across
her beloved bay,

1:32:07.567 --> 1:32:10.667
to celebrate the life
of Dora Jackson.

1:32:12.533 --> 1:32:14.333
Dora devoted her life

1:32:14.367 --> 1:32:17.767
to establishing a marine reserve
for future generations

1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.600
that stretches from here

1:32:19.633 --> 1:32:22.167
all the way out
to Robber's Head.

1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:24.600
A safe place at last.

1:32:25.767 --> 1:32:29.700
She wanted more of them,
other havens along the coast,

1:32:29.733 --> 1:32:32.833
but for now, as she came
to the end of her life,

1:32:32.867 --> 1:32:35.800
she was content with
everything she had achieved.

1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.833
And as we say farewell
to our dear friend,

1:32:39.867 --> 1:32:43.067
I thought I'd play
a very special song

1:32:43.100 --> 1:32:45.633
for fearless Dora.

1:32:55.367 --> 1:32:56.933
Thanks, Briggs.

1:32:58.300 --> 1:33:00.033
No worries.

1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:32.567
I love you.

1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:27.700
Abby!

1:34:27.733 --> 1:34:30.033
Gitundu, you would
not believe it here.

1:34:30.067 --> 1:34:32.467
My mum's marine reserve
is thriving.

1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:35.300
I saw a huge pod
of humpback whales.

1:34:35.333 --> 1:34:37.400
Every day, there are
whales off the shore.

1:34:37.433 --> 1:34:39.200
Amazing.

1:34:39.233 --> 1:34:41.200
A marine reserve?
That's incredible, Abby.

1:34:41.233 --> 1:34:43.367
And it's beautiful.

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:44.767
If you can gather

1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:46.033
my research material

1:34:46.067 --> 1:34:47.533
and the latest footage
of the reef,

1:34:47.567 --> 1:34:48.867
we've got some work to do.

1:34:48.900 --> 1:34:49.867
Great.

1:34:49.900 --> 1:34:51.300
Where do you want to begin?

1:34:51.333 --> 1:34:53.800
-Let's start right here.
-Yep.

1:34:53.833 --> 1:34:56.233
Take a good close look
at what we're fighting for.

1:34:56.267 --> 1:34:57.900
Amazing. We'll be there.

1:34:57.933 --> 1:34:59.333
Thanks, Gitundu.
