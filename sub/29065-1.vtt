WEBVTT

00:27.610 --> 00:28.653
BOSS!

00:30.363 --> 00:31.989
Boss, boss!

00:32.156 --> 00:33.824
You have to hear that!

00:34.075 --> 00:37.119
The sheep! She says,
that she and the Wélfe ...

00:37.203 --> 00:39.080
That they,
I had to tell you that.

00:39.163 --> 00:40.164
This is...

00:42.291 --> 00:43.334
Crazy!

00:43.543 --> 00:46.087
What is the stammering?
Tell me what Ios is!

00:46.128 --> 00:47.129
The Gypsy Héisin.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.341
She says there's a pack of wolves
that lives together with sheep.

00:50.466 --> 00:52.677
And they do not eat them.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.428
What? Unméglich.

00:54.512 --> 00:59.183
She said she told everyone, class
as wolves and sheep live together.

00:59.308 --> 01:00.810
I'm not deaf!

01:00.851 --> 01:02.562
W0 is this hare?

01:02.562 --> 01:03.646
At the back at the intersection.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.438
Get out of my way!

01:14.323 --> 01:18.703
Once upon a time there was a young wolf
called Gray.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.248
He was destined to be the next
Lead Wolf of his pack.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.377
He was in a beautiful Wélfin,
named Bianca, in love.

01:26.794 --> 01:32.466
Although she also loved him, she found him
too unconcerned and too selfish.

01:32.508 --> 01:37.555
Gray pulled Ios, willing to change
and to win her heart.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.599
And to his cluck,

01:40.016 --> 01:45.646
he found the greatest, most brilliant,
wisest and best Gypsy Héisin,

01:45.938 --> 01:49.775
they are also still
was incredibly attractive.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.986
Okay, Marni.
I think we got it.

01:52.194 --> 01:53.529
Do not interrupt me!

01:53.821 --> 01:54.780
Anyway.

01:54.905 --> 01:56.699
Gray came to me.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.035
I helped him to change.

01:59.201 --> 02:02.622
A potion spiiter,
he became a ram!

02:03.414 --> 02:05.041
He had no choice.

02:05.333 --> 02:09.336
So he lived with the sheep
and got to know their culture.

02:10.211 --> 02:13.007
As his old pack
wanted to attack the sheep,

02:13.215 --> 02:16.177
Gray urged the herd
and defended the city.

02:16.927 --> 02:20.389
He defeated bijsen Leitwolf Ragear,

02:20.556 --> 02:22.600
won his dream wife Bianca for herself

02:22.683 --> 02:25.394
and became a wolf again.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.730
He brought peace to them all.

02:27.855 --> 02:30.149
But the most important thing of all:

02:30.316 --> 02:34.028
All of you now
Earn "Gray, The Wolf" merchandise.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.289

for every purpose.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.916
More coat? GrijlSere hooves?

How about a few Hérnern?

02:49.210 --> 02:50.211

02:50.294 --> 02:52.088

02:52.296 --> 02:56.092

there is this special gray calendar.

02:57.885 --> 03:00.429

Hey, do not touch!

03:11.691 --> 03:12.650
As I said.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.403
I have magic trinkets,
for everything you can imagine.

03:15.611 --> 03:17.279

He is for a perm.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.244

03:25.830 --> 03:27.707
Okay Héischen,
What did I just tell you?

03:27.748 --> 03:29.291
That does not belong to you!

03:34.130 --> 03:35.172
Well.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.258
This potion is the First Cry.

03:37.341 --> 03:38.926
I can promise you that much.

03:39.009 --> 03:40.886

very trendy.

03:41.220 --> 03:43.139

03:51.355 --> 03:52.773
Did you ever listen to me!

04:05.703 --> 04:08.956
Gentlemen, you may be
interested in a t-shirt?

04:09.123 --> 04:11.876
I heard Gerblert,

04:11.876 --> 04:13.711
About certain species,
who live together peacefully.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.045
Stories?

04:15.337 --> 04:19.257
About a village,
where wolves and sheep live together.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.802
These are not stories!

04:21.927 --> 04:23.220
It's all true.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.388
You lillgstl

04:24.513 --> 04:26.348
This is against the laws of nature.

I became in my life
already called many things.

04:30.102 --> 04:32.313
But never as a Lijgnerin.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.231
This village exists!

04:34.523 --> 04:38.152
Governed by the valid

04:40.821 --> 04:42.490

04:46.535 --> 04:48.162
Okay, so then. I have to go.

04:52.541 --> 04:55.336

06:20.838 --> 06:23.173
Everyone here is in such a good mood.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.218
Why should it be different?
It's a nice day.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.970
Why are you doing such a thing?

06:28.178 --> 06:29.221
I'm just kidding.

06:29.263 --> 06:30.848
I am, these are your snouts.

06:31.056 --> 06:32.433
Here, take a donut.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.019

You can do it.

06:43.485 --> 06:44.445
Alright.

Friends!

06:58.125 --> 07:00.586

Coat or wool.

07:08.969 --> 07:12.806

and initiating an era of peace,

07:45.881 --> 07:47.967
I pass you my stick.

Belgour!

08:46.358 --> 08:47.401
Belgour!

08:47.443 --> 08:48.485
What's up, Cliff?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.612
Something bad is going on there.

08:50.779 --> 08:52.698
There are strangers outside the gates.

08:52.740 --> 08:56.243
A fox and a sheep.
And two wolves chase her.

08:56.368 --> 08:57.411
W6Ife?

08:57.578 --> 09:00.205
Hey guys,
Now everyone calms down again.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.458
No reason to worry.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.543
I'll take a look.

09:05.669 --> 09:06.712
Do you need help?

09:06.754 --> 09:08.047
No, that's not a big deal.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.673
I'm back in sheep's kiosk ...

09:09.715 --> 09:10.758
Well, you already know what I mean.

09:10.799 --> 09:11.967
Let me go with you.

09:12.092 --> 09:13.969
We are still here
in a celebration.

09:14.094 --> 09:16.221
And I mean,
what should happen to me?

09:16.388 --> 09:18.098
Just stay here
and take care of the others.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.309
And before you know it,
I'm back.

09:22.102 --> 09:24.063
Na Ios, people. Have SpalS!

09:36.158 --> 09:37.201
What is Ios here?

09:38.035 --> 09:39.536
Wow. I am just asking.

09:39.661 --> 09:40.871
Leave us alone.

09:41.038 --> 09:43.332
Hey, I just wanted
where do you two want to go?

09:43.457 --> 09:44.541
That's none of your business

09:44.666 --> 09:45.918
Why are you yelling at me?

09:46.126 --> 09:49.046
Hey, you want her
do not eat, right?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.923
What? Are you crazy?

09:51.006 --> 09:52.216
Do not stray!

09:54.093 --> 09:56.220
Hey, dude, we're talking.

09:56.261 --> 09:58.138
I'm not your buddy, you Kéter.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.473
Keter?

09:59.681 --> 10:02.267
- Do you know this guy?
- Do you want it easy?

10:02.267 --> 10:03.894
or the hard way?

10:04.186 --> 10:06.188
Catch your own Schwiinze,
Blédméinner.

10:06.438 --> 10:07.815
It looks like
as if you needed help.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.109
This is your end. Yes!

10:10.109 --> 10:12.277
Go to the gate down there.
There you will be helped.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.904
- But...
-I'm doing this already.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.240
I will go see the boys here
give a little lesson.

10:18.450 --> 10:19.660
What do you think, who you are?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.086
Hey!

10:32.631 --> 10:33.799
- What's this?
- Right, my fingers!

10:36.510 --> 10:37.553
Excuse me.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.183
Gray. Is that right, right?

10:43.517 --> 10:44.476
You know my name.

10:44.601 --> 10:46.687
Sch6n,
I always wanted to be famous.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.322
Your Bijmdnis with the sheep
is Iicher.

10:57.489 --> 11:00.909
It pulls the name
of every carnivore in the dirt.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.037
You are a wolf.

11:04.580 --> 11:05.622
A Jéiger.

11:05.914 --> 11:08.000
At the top of the food chain.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.836
Beat those stupid ideas
on the head.

11:10.961 --> 11:14.631
The biggest wolf festival
takes place already in three days.

11:14.798 --> 11:19.553
Join our pack
and we celebrate how we do it.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.599
I hope we have then
good sheep meat on our table.

11:24.057 --> 11:26.894
Otherwise we will come to your village

11:27.186 --> 11:29.271
and then just celebrate it there.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.204
Hey, sorry,
Can we help you somehow?

11:45.370 --> 11:46.330
My name is Simone.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.041
I heard about a place
living together peacefully in the world,

11:49.041 --> 11:51.752
with sheep, hamsters, rabbits and ...

11:52.711 --> 11:54.046
With herbivores?

11:54.087 --> 11:57.549
Yes, I just do not want anymore
to be an enemy of herbivores.

11:57.674 --> 12:00.135
Josey and I left,
to see if it is true.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.729
Hey!

12:11.521 --> 12:13.523
Did it hurt,
when you fell from the sky?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.901
You make me crazy.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.778
Wait. No, no, sorry.

12:17.986 --> 12:19.488
Your eyes are like ...

12:19.571 --> 12:21.448
Wait. No, no, sorry.

12:21.531 --> 12:22.574
Are you alright, my friend?

12:22.741 --> 12:23.784
Erzéihl already.

12:23.992 --> 12:25.410
You wanted something
About my eyes say.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.370
No, I did not want that.

12:26.411 --> 12:29.289
I think my eyes are Coelin,
but my wife says they are just blue.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.416
- What do you say?
- That's not what I ...

12:33.794 --> 12:36.964
Gray is still not back.
Something must have happened.

12:52.604 --> 12:54.147
Hey, Gray, how are you?

12:58.110 --> 12:59.653
Hey, Gray.

13:08.870 --> 13:09.830
Hi!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.249
Gray!

13:13.041 --> 13:17.879
If I'm big, then I will
Our village just as you protect.

13:24.886 --> 13:26.138
Of course you will.

13:35.522 --> 13:36.982
I have bad news.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.401
The black wolves threaten us.

13:39.943 --> 13:42.571
They want everything from us
It will be the same again as it used to be.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.282
If we do not,
they will attack.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.201
- Oh no.
- It was just starting to get shy.

13:48.368 --> 13:51.747
- Als0 what should we do? Run?
- They can not do that!

13:52.205 --> 13:54.166
You're right. They can not do that.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.668
We are so tough
worked for peace.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.588
We do not let anyone tell us
as we should.

13:59.629 --> 14:01.465
But how should we defend ourselves?

14:01.548 --> 14:04.551
Everyone, yes, class
the blacks are the stars.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.928
Yes, I have heard
they are really scary.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.139
So you just want to move your head
and give up?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.390
No!

14:10.474 --> 14:13.393
If we run away now, then
we have to hide forever.

14:13.560 --> 14:15.729
We need for our
Convince conviction.

14:15.812 --> 14:17.397
We do not let us
just hanging around like that

14:17.773 --> 14:20.233
We have the right
to live in peace.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.486
You're absolutely right, darling.

14:22.527 --> 14:24.613
I'm 100 percent behind you.

14:25.697 --> 14:27.657
We show you,
from which wood we are carved.

14:28.283 --> 14:30.827
We are giving this barbarian a fight!

14:31.411 --> 14:33.538
Bucho, gather the Stésten of us.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.041
- We have to train for the fight.
- Right.

14:36.124 --> 14:38.085
I will make a defense plan.

14:38.418 --> 14:41.338
What do we need a plan for? We will
to develop something in the meantime.

14:41.421 --> 14:43.048
Go and get all the heaviness,
what you have.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.883
We have to reinforce the main gate.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.135
You will regret it
to have gotten on with us!

15:24.631 --> 15:26.550
- What's this?
-I have no idea.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.343
I have it in
Belgours shed found.

15:59.207 --> 16:00.876
We started
to build a bulwark.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.503
Do you have that?

16:03.587 --> 16:05.672
Yes and we will be there soon
have finished.

16:05.672 --> 16:09.426
Oh, you will be so proud. And then
I show the guys some techniques.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.303
Do you remember the one with the
Téiuschungsmanéver?

16:11.428 --> 16:12.637
Gray, Gray.

16:12.721 --> 16:13.805
- And the other is the ...
- Gray!

16:13.972 --> 16:14.931
Listen to me!

16:14.973 --> 16:18.143
You are now the leader,
from our united society.

16:18.351 --> 16:21.188
You do not have to be uberjede
Report the decision you make.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.772
It's all in your hands now.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.650
- But...
- Everything is in your hands.

16:26.902 --> 16:30.322
- Yes, but I just thought, I had ...
- Fear?

16:31.448 --> 16:33.283
Do not worry.
Fear is completely normal.

16:33.450 --> 16:37.829
We, your people, will always follow you
and help you in the hour of need.

16:38.246 --> 16:39.331
Thanks, Belgour.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.375
And now go.
The bulwark does not build by itself.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.127
Oh yeah. Thanks, Belgour.

16:45.086 --> 16:47.255
Incidentally, the second technique,
that I talked about ...

16:47.255 --> 16:50.175
Come on. You have to go now!

16:50.258 --> 16:51.218
Already gone.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.567
Get me down here!

17:25.627 --> 17:27.712
Well, at least
it will distract her for a while.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.631
Zico, is that supposed to be a joke?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.049
Do you have a better idea?

17:31.132 --> 17:33.260
Natilrlich
I have a better idea than that.

17:33.426 --> 17:36.054
- Who would you like?
- We need a plan for the fortress.

17:36.304 --> 17:38.014
Why are you doing
then not just the plan?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.392
I? You're the chief engineer.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.560
So get to work.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.937
Hurry up, Zico. Hurry up.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.855
We need him in half an hour.

17:55.198 --> 17:58.076
I see you. I see your future.

17:58.451 --> 18:00.287
The cards tell me

18:00.662 --> 18:03.456
that you all have a power
Kick in the butt will get.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.668
Yes, a long journey
ends with a defeat.

18:07.168 --> 18:09.129
Watch what you say, Gypsy.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.632
I beg your pardon? I say
Do not tell the cards what to say.

18:12.799 --> 18:15.343
Here is the long journey,
since the kick in the butt.

18:15.468 --> 18:17.304
And the winner
is the king of hearts.

18:19.014 --> 18:23.059
Tomorrow this Verréiter Gray will
serve the sheep on a tray.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.811
Because he is scared.

18:28.523 --> 18:29.566
WHITE.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.902
I see something.

18:32.944 --> 18:33.945
What?

18:33.945 --> 18:35.697
- What, what do you see?
-I see ...

18:35.947 --> 18:38.575
a stupid, matted idiot.

18:38.658 --> 18:39.743
How dare you!

18:39.868 --> 18:40.994
BOSS!

18:40.994 --> 18:42.203
Boss?

18:42.704 --> 18:44.456
You build a ...
I saw it myself.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.666
Think about that,
they can fight us?

18:46.708 --> 18:48.668
Do not punish the messenger, boss.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.545
If you really want it that way,

18:51.087 --> 18:53.506
then we will bring them
one or two things about nature.

18:54.090 --> 18:56.176
He is a pretty agitated fellow
or?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
Actually, it's even worse.

18:58.845 --> 19:00.138
Call everyone together immediately.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.890
We will attack now!

19:02.098 --> 19:03.058
Yup!

19:03.433 --> 19:05.477
You're dilmmer than I thought, Gray.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.104
Did you better listen to me?

19:09.105 --> 19:10.106
- Garky?
- What?

19:10.148 --> 19:12.692
The first step is
to accept the problem.

19:12.817 --> 19:13.818
What?

19:13.985 --> 19:17.113
You may have forgotten
but you are a prisoner here.

19:17.238 --> 19:18.907
You worthless Hoppler!

19:20.241 --> 19:22.786
That's exactly what the cards say.

19:22.827 --> 19:25.205
If you go out today,
something bad will happen to you.

19:25.246 --> 19:27.582
Schbn and good,
but I say, we attack now.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.501
And you can not stop me!

19:54.818 --> 19:56.736
That is exactly it,
of which I spoke.

19:56.861 --> 19:59.406
Look,
what your temper with you.

20:02.992 --> 20:05.829
As the danger
her hateful face showed

20:05.870 --> 20:10.083
came the cheapest heads of the village
together to defend their people.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.170
What I will show you now
will amaze and amaze you.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.632
Watch out!

20:17.966 --> 20:21.136
If everything goes according to plan, then
This will be the best fortress ever.

20:21.344 --> 20:22.470
A surveillance tower.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.765
An entrance, a bedroom,
a canteen.

20:26.182 --> 20:27.225
Is this a kijrbis?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.518
This is a plastic model.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.438
I can help to build up Vorréite.

20:31.938 --> 20:33.857
Thank you darling. That's great.

20:35.191 --> 20:37.986
Zico, give him a task
and then let's start.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.446
Roger that!

20:42.907 --> 20:43.908
Hobbler, put together a group.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.745
- And me too, right?
-You take care of the foundation.

20:46.911 --> 20:47.912
Or?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.373
Chuck, you're the second team.
You build the tower.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.916
Wait a moment. What is with me?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.710
Winnie, you're for
the defense responsible.

20:55.044 --> 20:56.129
What should I do?

20:56.379 --> 20:57.714
- guys?
- Nothing!

20:57.881 --> 20:59.799
- You just stay calm.
- But I also want to build.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.676
Let me help you.
If Winnie can lead a team,

21:01.801 --> 21:04.345
- Why can not I do it then?
- Because I'm responsible.

21:04.512 --> 21:06.055
I also want to build.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.433
- And I want to live.
- What do you mean by that?

21:08.475 --> 21:09.601
Do not touch anything here!

21:11.561 --> 21:12.896
Who is fijr again
the defense responsible?

21:13.188 --> 21:14.439
You, 5h ... Winnie.

21:14.647 --> 21:16.065
-I?
- Not skinny. Winnie!

21:16.191 --> 21:18.026
-I am Winnie now?
- No, such a kiss.

21:18.109 --> 21:19.694
- What fijlr a Kiise?
- Well, the kéise of you.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.779
You have Kéise fijr me?

21:20.862 --> 21:22.113
- Are you me?
I'm lost.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.364
-I thought you were Skinny?
- I am too.

21:23.364 --> 21:26.117
I just thought about the defense
take care ...

21:26.326 --> 21:27.368
Yes exactly. Winnie.

21:27.535 --> 21:28.703
Well, me and Winnie.

21:28.995 --> 21:30.371
No, only Winnie, not you.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.458
He is oblique.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.751
Who needs help?

22:09.202 --> 22:10.495
Okay, you do not have to.

22:10.578 --> 22:11.996
Bring the Pféihle there.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.249
No, no, no, Phil. Fester.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.503
Moz? M02, what are you doing there?

22:18.628 --> 22:19.838
Do not nail the openings!

22:19.879 --> 22:21.714
- These are hatches.
- hatches?

22:22.340 --> 22:23.633
Why do we need hatches?

22:23.967 --> 22:26.803
Here are grids, which the
black Wijlfe can not overcome.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.555
So you have to come from here.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.098
Then we open this hatch,

22:30.181 --> 22:31.182
And then,

22:31.266 --> 22:32.267
Barn!

22:32.350 --> 22:34.227
Refined and creative.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.104
Why do not we make it grijlSer?

22:38.231 --> 22:39.482
Sorry, as far as I can remember,

22:39.607 --> 22:41.734
I have the order,
to build the fortress.

22:41.901 --> 22:43.611
H6r, go there to help.

22:43.945 --> 22:44.946
- W0?
- Just play it.

22:45.113 --> 22:46.114
Back quite there.

22:46.239 --> 22:49.242
- W0 because exactly?
- Somewhere, but not here.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.040
- Did you see that?
- Yes.

22:56.124 --> 22:58.459
- Sharpen.
- And falling stuff.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.920
I do not want to go under
be falling down.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.505
That's what we have to tell the boss.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.382
- Hurry up.
- But this time,

23:04.549 --> 23:05.592
you have to tell him.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.417
And again Mommy wins.

23:39.542 --> 23:40.668
You are cheating!

23:41.544 --> 23:43.630
No reason to show the Zéihne
Sir.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.506
I'm just smart.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.758
Another game?

23:46.883 --> 23:48.718
- Get lost!
-I can not.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.262
As far as I can remember,
I am your prisoner.

23:51.387 --> 23:53.640
You look so angry all the time.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.141
Have you ever tried camomile?

23:55.266 --> 23:56.517
I am not angry.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.519
Of course not.

23:58.686 --> 24:02.065
- Als0, tell me. How are you?
- Well, it all started with my mother.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.608
Wait. What? No!

24:05.360 --> 24:07.070
Can she maybe one?
get out of here?

24:07.153 --> 24:09.364
- This way, Madame.
- Thank you, young man.

24:09.614 --> 24:10.657
How is your muzzle?

24:10.698 --> 24:13.242
Super. Your uterine envelope has
Worked miracles, Marni.

24:13.952 --> 24:17.413
Why do not you make her another cup?
Tea, if you're there anyway, Dee?

24:17.497 --> 24:18.957
Go out!

24:19.248 --> 24:20.625
WHITE!

24:20.708 --> 24:22.460
- What's this?
- What is what, sir?

24:23.127 --> 24:24.545
This one.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.464
This is a cotton-polyester blend.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.007
It's pretty easy to wash.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.094
Take that away from my eyes,
before I rip you off!

24:31.427 --> 24:33.846
And where is the report,
I'm waiting for?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.264
Dum! The fortress!

24:35.890 --> 24:36.891
I'm already under.

24:36.891 --> 24:39.394
What in the world is Ios here?

24:39.435 --> 24:40.645
I bring the report, boss.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.065
In Grays village they build a fortress
full of traps.

24:45.024 --> 24:47.276
A surprising turn.
I'm right?

24:54.826 --> 24:55.868
Hello Gark!

24:55.910 --> 24:56.911
Did you hear it already?

24:57.036 --> 24:58.121
The location is Ieider the ...

25:18.141 --> 25:19.350
Garky, Garky.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.562
You really should
Pay attention to your blood pressure.

25:22.645 --> 25:23.938
Here, take a break.

25:24.063 --> 25:27.025
A blanket and some tea will help.

25:27.108 --> 25:29.944
So, you do not have to think that Gray ...

25:30.570 --> 25:32.447
Héinde gone, bunny.

25:32.655 --> 25:33.781
I'm fine.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.452
I have somebody in the village, he himself
around this stupid fortress kijmmert.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.620
And if I'm that plaster Ios,

25:39.871 --> 25:43.207
Gray will wish,
that he never met me.

25:45.626 --> 25:46.878
Funny Wolf.

25:59.223 --> 26:00.224
ReingielSen

26:01.893 --> 26:04.854
and now help the others
and leave me alone.

27:41.367 --> 27:44.537
Tell me, are you sure, class
the fortress should look like this?

27:45.496 --> 27:47.456
If it is so drawn,
then it's right.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.458
You have
no idea about these things.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.085
Do not stand in my way.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.378
You only think about it.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.756
Very strange.

28:03.806 --> 28:04.807
Hey what...

28:05.016 --> 28:07.518
Why are you pulling him up his nose?

28:07.685 --> 28:10.605
OK. One should get the doctor.

28:10.771 --> 28:11.981
Hey, Bucho,

28:12.106 --> 28:13.149
How does it work with the training?

28:13.191 --> 28:16.903
Well, they are very rusty.
We are still at the base camp.

28:16.944 --> 28:18.279
Well, how bad is it?

28:18.571 --> 28:20.281
Let's see.
We have fijmf bruises,

28:20.448 --> 28:23.701
three broken bones, seven
Auskugelungen, a broken chin ...

28:24.619 --> 28:28.289
Bucho, catch one
Warm-up on when it gets so bad.

28:28.497 --> 28:30.082
I just talked about that.

28:30.082 --> 28:31.751
These were the consequences
the warm-up.

28:31.751 --> 28:33.211
Now we come to that
proper training.

28:33.377 --> 28:35.546
-23 broken bones ...
- Bucho, Bucho, wait ...

28:37.673 --> 28:38.674
What's that about?

28:38.966 --> 28:41.093
Here we train the power,
by starting with

28:41.302 --> 28:42.970
race with the horns against the tree.

28:43.804 --> 28:45.640
Enjoy me.
W0 Is the current record?

28:45.681 --> 28:46.766
Well, so far,

28:46.849 --> 28:49.352
so far we are still training
to hit the tree.

28:51.562 --> 28:52.605
Help.

28:54.273 --> 28:55.942
Why are not they there with them?

28:56.484 --> 28:58.027
Our medical emergency.

28:58.110 --> 28:59.111
They are

28:59.487 --> 29:01.072
freed, for health Grijmden.

29:01.155 --> 29:02.156
Here are the certificates.

29:02.156 --> 29:03.157
The certificates?

29:03.157 --> 29:04.242
What proof, Bucho?

29:04.283 --> 29:05.284
No exceptions.

29:05.534 --> 29:07.078
The black wolves come.

29:07.161 --> 29:10.539
You will try everything possible
to get to our village.

29:10.665 --> 29:11.832
So we have to open our eyes ...

29:11.999 --> 29:13.918
One more piece. Another small piece.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.462
- Why is that so hard?
- What's this?

29:16.671 --> 29:19.090
Delivery for the village.
Paid by the sender.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.424
Please sign below.

29:21.550 --> 29:22.885
Well, if it is already paid.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.303
Bucho, no!

29:24.387 --> 29:25.596
Bring it back
to the sender.

29:26.138 --> 29:29.058
Bucho, as I said. We have to go now
be extra careful.

29:29.141 --> 29:30.810
Even very careful.

29:31.185 --> 29:34.188
If you do not see how that works.
Then ask Zico.

29:34.188 --> 29:35.564
He gives you a whole lecture on it.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.276
He even has two students
written about it.

29:38.526 --> 29:41.237
Okay, the boys do not do it
especially fit impression.

29:41.445 --> 29:43.364
They are already after the treadmill k.o.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.325
Yes, 3O meters are for the guys
a really brutal route.

29:46.742 --> 29:49.078
3O meters are one for her
brutal route?

29:49.412 --> 29:50.371
Bucho, can ...

29:50.538 --> 29:52.873
Can it, class fijlr diejungs
everything is really brutal?

29:53.082 --> 29:54.583
Yes. That may be.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.585
What? Bucho, show me!

29:56.627 --> 29:59.088
How are the physical
Fitness standards? Weight lifting?

29:59.171 --> 30:02.967
Well, if the weight is heavy,
then it becomes problematic.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.928
What about the long jump?

30:06.012 --> 30:08.931
Well, they do not jump very far.
They fall sooner.

30:10.725 --> 30:11.976
The obstacle course?

30:12.685 --> 30:13.853
Javelin?

30:14.353 --> 30:15.354
Are you serious?

30:15.604 --> 30:17.606
You are a spear to them
give into the hand?

30:17.690 --> 30:18.816
After what you saw?

30:20.484 --> 30:21.819
What about the Wélfen?

30:21.902 --> 30:23.446
The Wélfe should be fit after all.

30:23.571 --> 30:26.157
You have a good sense of smell
and all the necessary instincts.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.909
Well, lately, when we're looking for that
have played,

30:29.285 --> 30:30.911
It did not work out that well.

30:38.294 --> 30:40.463
There drijben! There drilben! There drijlben!
There drilben!

30:40.588 --> 30:42.923
What are you doing here?
in this training camp?

30:42.923 --> 30:45.509
Yes you are right.
The boys are not in good shape.

30:45.551 --> 30:47.261
Oh really? So you think so too?

30:47.261 --> 30:49.055
But it's not just about it.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.599
Someone sabotages our training.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.683
Sabotage?

30:53.100 --> 30:54.101
But who?

30:54.393 --> 30:55.394
Who would do such a thing?

30:55.686 --> 30:57.146
It could be anyone.

30:58.689 --> 31:00.149
It could be anyone.

31:02.109 --> 31:03.110
Anyone could be here.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.153
Every wolf.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.780
Yes, or any sheep.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.656
Hey, do not start that way.

31:07.740 --> 31:10.117
I mean, anyone
plays the boys against each other.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.911
Stéindig there are praises,
they argue.

31:11.994 --> 31:14.246
One gets less food
in the canteen.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.498
The other gets too much ice.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.375
Here is sabotaged, since unrest donated.

31:17.416 --> 31:18.876
Here and there something.

31:18.876 --> 31:22.004
How should they practice with each other,
if they do not trust each other.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.173
Of course, they are angry
and distrust each other ...

31:24.256 --> 31:25.925
Yes, Rudolph, what is it?

31:25.966 --> 31:28.803
I saw you standing here and
thought we could have a chat.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.137
Thanks, but later.

31:31.138 --> 31:33.474
OK. See you then, Gray.

31:33.516 --> 31:35.810
Do you see? He is furious.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.145
I really do my best here.
They all look up to me.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.648
But the mood here
is too tense.

31:40.731 --> 31:41.732
But Bucho,

31:41.732 --> 31:43.192
Who would want to sabotage us?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.986
Are you sure,
that you are not just imagining that?

31:46.529 --> 31:47.655
I should imagine that?

31:47.696 --> 31:50.783
Hey, Fred, Gray asks,
if I'm just imagining that.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.536
As Fred in the
Pool has jumped,

31:53.744 --> 31:55.287
all the water was gone.

31:56.163 --> 31:58.249
Fred, how are you?

31:58.332 --> 32:00.918
He will answer you,
when his hearing is working again.

32:00.960 --> 32:01.961
Oh, you mean GiJte.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.506
Oh, he'll be fine again. He jumps
still in the pool.

32:05.631 --> 32:08.551
Is not it, Fred? How does it heal?
"On the ground, but not dead yet".

32:08.884 --> 32:11.679
Every day one of the boys pats
into one of those awful traps.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.347
Some even more than others.

32:13.389 --> 32:14.557
Let's take an example, imagine:

32:14.723 --> 32:17.852
You're training your progress around this
to make black wolves difficult.

32:18.060 --> 32:21.355
But instead of a normal ball,
do you get a bowling ball!

32:21.689 --> 32:24.442
Then you switch to a safer,
less traumatic sport.

32:24.525 --> 32:27.570
You wait for the shuttlecock,
that you are good at.

32:27.611 --> 32:29.488
But what do you get? A bowling ball!

32:29.697 --> 32:31.532
Then you go to the infirmary,

32:31.657 --> 32:34.493
after you've gone through so much,
and think, "At last I can sleep."

32:34.493 --> 32:36.412
So you pull on the string,
to turn off the light

32:38.205 --> 32:39.457
and then comes the bowling ...

32:39.665 --> 32:41.500
Okay, okay, I got it.

32:41.667 --> 32:42.960
Drum all together.

32:50.759 --> 32:52.887
Soldiers, you are the best,
we ...

32:56.682 --> 32:58.809
Let me show you
how you can defend yourself.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.645
So. Who volunteers?

33:01.770 --> 33:02.771
Then one step ahead.

33:04.106 --> 33:06.108
Okay, Fred does not count Ieider.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.110
- Oh, how long do you want to ...
- Gray!

33:08.861 --> 33:09.987
Gray!

33:09.987 --> 33:12.364
The TiJrme! They are getting involved!

33:16.660 --> 33:17.828
Oh no!

33:23.125 --> 33:24.502
Oh no!

33:30.716 --> 33:31.884
Run!

34:01.372 --> 34:02.498
Gray!

34:08.087 --> 34:09.129
Come, people!

34:09.170 --> 34:10.172
Hurry up!

34:33.654 --> 34:36.489
Oh, you mean GiJte.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.015
Help!

35:01.098 --> 35:02.600
Somebody!

35:04.518 --> 35:05.519
Help!

35:08.480 --> 35:09.815
Help!

35:12.818 --> 35:14.111
- Help!
- skinny!

36:13.003 --> 36:14.171
Are you all unhurt?

36:16.382 --> 36:18.509
- What happened?
I was so scared.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.317
Gray. Gray!

36:36.485 --> 36:37.778
Come here. Gray!

36:38.654 --> 36:39.905
Do you have a moment?

36:40.030 --> 36:41.615
Zico, I'm really busy.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.284
The fortress is closed and
we need a new plan.

36:44.326 --> 36:45.494
Are not you wondering why?

36:45.577 --> 36:47.496
Someone sabotaged our blueprint.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.039
Someone has added a fixture.

36:49.039 --> 36:51.083
This has all the statics
mixed up.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.460
- Worthy of note.
- This is more than strange.

36:53.544 --> 36:54.670
What do you think, who would do such a thing?

36:54.670 --> 36:56.338
I do not want anyone
show with the hoof,

36:56.380 --> 36:59.049
but we do have one indeed
verdicht Neuankémmling among us.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.009
Simone?

37:01.009 --> 37:02.845
As I said,
I do not want to show anyone here.

37:02.928 --> 37:04.179
But she looks so nice.

37:04.346 --> 37:05.514
Maybe she just plays it.

37:05.806 --> 37:08.267
What if they were from the black Wblfen
was secretly introduced?

37:08.517 --> 37:09.852
Do you know that we know it?

37:09.893 --> 37:11.520
And do you know that we know
that they know?

37:11.812 --> 37:13.814
And if we know
that they know, how do we know that?

37:13.939 --> 37:15.983
How do we know them,
that we know it? Because you are?

37:16.275 --> 37:18.986
Zico, I have no idea
what you are talking about at all.

37:19.069 --> 37:20.070
What I said was:

37:20.112 --> 37:21.739
How do we know if they know
that I know, that they know ...

37:21.822 --> 37:24.783
Stop! If someone is with ours
Has plagued Pléinen,

37:24.908 --> 37:26.034
then we should keep our eyes open.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.703
Could you do that for me?

37:27.828 --> 37:28.954
With the griest pleasure.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.680
N / A?

37:50.309 --> 37:53.228
Josey! Hey. Hey! Josey!

38:38.065 --> 38:39.608
Do you see anything of interest?

38:40.776 --> 38:42.194
No. I mean,

38:42.361 --> 38:43.821
not that you are not interesting.

38:44.321 --> 38:45.948
-I just mean ...
- You spy on me.

38:46.031 --> 38:47.699
- since yesterday.
- No!

38:47.908 --> 38:50.452
Not really. No, I was just ...

38:50.619 --> 38:52.663
Are you following me?

38:53.121 --> 38:54.331
What? No.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.374
Of course not.

38:55.415 --> 38:56.500
Is a small village, because you are.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.293
You're here every now and then
About the way.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.421
Would not surprise me if I am myself
One day I myself cross the way.

39:04.091 --> 39:05.133
I understand already.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.468
I'm sorry, Zico.

39:06.677 --> 39:07.803
You're not my type.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.807
That's not the reason for that,
that I followed you

39:12.683 --> 39:14.643
Aha! So you give it to me then?

39:15.477 --> 39:17.521
Yes, but for a different reason.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.273
I just want to know
what you have in mind.

39:20.399 --> 39:22.943
My dream is to become a botanist.

39:23.110 --> 39:25.612
That's why you pluck it
flowers every day?

39:25.779 --> 39:27.865
Yes. Look, how do you like these?

39:29.116 --> 39:33.579
I spend the whole day spying on a spy
after all, she is only a botanist.

39:33.787 --> 39:35.205
What do I say Gray now?

39:35.205 --> 39:37.541
That you are a great botanist
have found.

39:39.042 --> 39:40.502
Gray, what should we do?

39:41.086 --> 39:43.046
The fortress is set.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.215
What should we do now?

39:45.299 --> 39:46.383
Well. So, I think that ...

39:47.926 --> 39:49.011
No. No.

39:49.136 --> 39:52.598
The plan is, you ask
all of you in a row. Yes!

39:52.681 --> 39:56.268
Stand up all in a row and
seek your opponent for defense.

40:04.192 --> 40:06.403
What are you feeling sick, Gray?

40:09.031 --> 40:11.491
I ... Because you are Belgorian ...

40:13.869 --> 40:16.038
I realize that you are desperate.

40:16.038 --> 40:19.249
The black wolves are soon here,
but I am of no use.

40:19.374 --> 40:21.460
I can not help.
I can not teach you either.

40:21.501 --> 40:22.711
I can not be a hero.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.631
Add to that my fortress
almost all killed héitte.

40:25.964 --> 40:28.675
I'm just not an affiliate, I think.

40:29.885 --> 40:31.345
You made a mistake.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.804
How interesting.

40:33.096 --> 40:35.307
You say,
that I made a mistake.

40:35.307 --> 40:37.935
But still believe me
the leader could be.

40:37.976 --> 40:40.103
And you also made a mistake.

40:40.103 --> 40:41.563
So, where is the difference?

40:42.272 --> 40:45.400
Who told you, class
Anfilhrer must not make mistakes?

40:45.484 --> 40:46.485
But I thought ...

41:00.123 --> 41:04.670
Doing no mistakes still makes one
not to the leader or heroes, Gray.

41:05.337 --> 41:07.339
But to admit his mistakes

41:07.673 --> 41:11.176
and they as an ingredient
to accept his journey, it does.

41:11.802 --> 41:12.970
So you mean ...

41:22.270 --> 41:25.273
Every chaos can be transformed

41:25.440 --> 41:27.526
in something beautiful.

41:27.609 --> 41:28.652
Transformed?

41:28.652 --> 41:29.653
That's it.

41:29.653 --> 41:30.696
Mami!

41:30.779 --> 41:32.531
We have to ask Mommy for help.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.993
She can, I do not, the black ones
Wélfe in Kéifer or something like that.

41:36.326 --> 41:38.328
Or she transforms everything
the sheep in wolf warriors.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.122
Stop, that's not what I ...

41:40.205 --> 41:41.373
Thanks, Belgour.

41:41.415 --> 41:42.457
Great idea!

41:45.419 --> 41:46.461
Before I leave,

41:46.628 --> 41:49.589
how are you actually doing
this colorful wind and all the stuff?

41:50.090 --> 41:51.675
No wait. Do not tell me.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.635
I understand already. It's a secret.

41:53.719 --> 41:54.928
OK. See you.

41:55.595 --> 41:57.055
This new generation.

41:57.597 --> 41:59.433
Believe, you just know everything.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.033
Swallow and ears!

42:16.283 --> 42:18.285
Extend hérner and hooves!

42:18.618 --> 42:19.745
OK.

42:19.870 --> 42:20.871
OK.

42:21.747 --> 42:23.874
I'm not sure.
This is by no means possible.

42:23.999 --> 42:25.042
OK.

42:25.208 --> 42:27.919
What you must know about the enemy,
is ...

42:27.961 --> 42:30.505
What are these dignified targets
Bring at all?

42:30.714 --> 42:34.509
Tell blQIS, you do not like that?
The defy even grélSten Hérnerkréiften.

42:34.801 --> 42:35.802
What, Hijrnerkräifte?

42:35.969 --> 42:38.221
The Wélfe will be
shatter those things.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.057
Then we have to start new ones again.

42:40.098 --> 42:43.727
Well, then it's good
If we have more of it.

42:49.399 --> 42:51.526
Who is this? A black wolf?

42:51.818 --> 42:54.780
Let go. Do not hold me tight.
Oh ... Oh, Gray, it's you.

42:56.990 --> 42:58.825
Great, guys. Good work.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.660
You look good. Nice combat kit.

43:01.036 --> 43:03.080
Hey, the head protection is exemplary.

43:03.205 --> 43:05.707
- You do not have to worry about us.
- Yes.

43:05.832 --> 43:07.042
My friend here and me,
we are ready.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.585
It can go Ios, Gray.

43:15.008 --> 43:16.051
Well, how is it here, people?

43:16.635 --> 43:18.428
The weapons for defense
are handed out.

43:18.470 --> 43:19.596
What shall we do now?

43:19.679 --> 43:21.181
We have to find mommy.

43:21.264 --> 43:22.265
And fast.

43:22.349 --> 43:23.350
Mami?

43:23.433 --> 43:25.811
That is impossible.
She could be anywhere.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.020
I know where she is.

43:27.938 --> 43:29.731
She is being held captive by Gark.

43:29.981 --> 43:31.525
He caught her at the intersection.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.486
She is not a spy.
She is just a botanist.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.404
- What?
- Yes, exactly, me.

43:36.446 --> 43:37.656
What is a botanist?

43:37.739 --> 43:39.825
That's ... forget it.
You are hopeless.

43:40.617 --> 43:41.618
<I> GTQY - </ i>

43:41.952 --> 43:43.370
I will free mom.

43:43.995 --> 43:44.996
I go with you.

43:45.038 --> 43:46.123
Bianca. But...

43:46.164 --> 43:48.708
I have you before
almost lost.

44:18.738 --> 44:19.781
Eindringli ...

44:24.286 --> 44:25.453
Not bad.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.926
"Such a strong rude."

45:21.635 --> 45:22.636
Here Iang.

45:23.011 --> 45:26.306
"... learns to establish himself."

45:29.017 --> 45:30.018
Hey.

46:03.009 --> 46:04.344
Very well.

46:04.594 --> 46:07.931
You always pull a page
through the previous one.

46:08.014 --> 46:09.140
Exactly.

46:09.766 --> 46:11.518
- Have a look.
- Yes!

46:11.559 --> 46:14.229
This is how you tackle stitches.
This looks very good.

46:14.479 --> 46:18.400
You just can not pull tight,
otherwise you will do the wool ...

46:20.068 --> 46:21.236
-broken.
- Hey, mom,

46:21.319 --> 46:22.696
do you think griJn suits me?

46:22.779 --> 46:24.447
Dum says no, but I like it.

46:24.614 --> 46:27.367
I think that every color
one likes, one stands.

46:31.329 --> 46:34.082
Yes, my speech. But he means
it does not match my coat.

46:34.165 --> 46:36.167
- It does not.
- No, do not say that.

46:36.209 --> 46:38.420
I tell him that too.
Brown suits everything.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.380
And what does he say?

46:40.505 --> 46:42.590
He says brown does not go well with anything.

46:42.590 --> 46:44.050
What should I do there?

46:44.467 --> 46:46.136
Well, I still have
taken the green yarn.

46:46.303 --> 46:48.596
Simply because sometimes you are against
all the negativity must ask.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.433
That's what I always say.
Stand against the negativity.

46:51.558 --> 46:53.101
Is that so, yes?
- Yes?

46:53.143 --> 46:56.187
Because you have to do that
what makes you happy.

46:56.354 --> 46:57.397
What?

46:57.981 --> 46:59.482
What is this all about?

46:59.566 --> 47:01.818
- Where is the prisoner?
- It just teaches us how to ...

47:05.780 --> 47:07.574
I'll fool you like that
what to teach!

47:07.741 --> 47:10.118
Come on, bring it back right away!

47:11.536 --> 47:13.455
Mommy, we need your help.

47:13.455 --> 47:14.956
Whatever you want,
my liar Wolf.

47:14.998 --> 47:17.292
- We need a potion.
- Oh, Schizitzchen.

47:17.292 --> 47:19.210
They all have my magic powers.

47:19.669 --> 47:21.463
But, that does not matter.

47:21.546 --> 47:24.466
Just leave us a little bit
experiment and see what happens.

47:31.681 --> 47:34.476
A pinch of this and a little bit of it.

47:34.684 --> 47:36.561
So and that was it.

47:40.106 --> 47:41.149
What does the soup do?

47:41.316 --> 47:45.695
It turns you all into
fire-breathing dragons.

47:46.237 --> 47:47.822
However, it can too
Side effects come.

47:47.906 --> 47:51.242
Like a scaly skin, a
heated Gemijt or a dry mouth.

47:51.451 --> 47:53.703
You already are, from the fire and everything.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.456
We do not need a fortress.

47:56.498 --> 48:00.168
Yes. We defeat the black Wélfe
without problems.

48:00.168 --> 48:01.961
I'm not so sure.

48:02.003 --> 48:04.672
Gray, are you still?
when she turned you into a sheep?

48:05.215 --> 48:07.884
- Wies0?
-I'm probably slipped.

48:08.134 --> 48:10.637
All right then,
who would like to try first?

48:11.012 --> 48:12.097
I'll try it.

48:12.263 --> 48:14.474
Are you crazy?
Do not get too close to the stuff.

48:14.474 --> 48:15.600
It is possible...

48:16.351 --> 48:17.435
Oh, poor little creature.

48:17.477 --> 48:18.603
Why so grumpy?

48:18.895 --> 48:20.105
I'm fed up!

48:20.230 --> 48:21.648
First we integrate other species.

48:21.648 --> 48:25.652
Now every squirrel can, rabbits
or every snail ordering us around.

48:25.777 --> 48:26.736
Get out of my way!

48:27.070 --> 48:28.238
Anyone else?

48:28.321 --> 48:31.074
The healthier it is, the lower
is the danger of dying.

48:31.449 --> 48:33.034
Come on, Gray.

48:33.159 --> 48:34.536
I'm so fed up!

48:35.995 --> 48:39.290
Josey, your eyes remind me
to the moon at night.

48:39.457 --> 48:41.543
Or moon cake. Moon cake!

48:41.626 --> 48:43.795
GrQISe chocolate moon cake.

48:45.338 --> 48:47.757
Josey! Do you want to taste the soup,
Josey?

48:48.675 --> 48:50.427
It really smells itchy.

49:08.695 --> 49:09.696
Josey?

49:09.737 --> 49:12.157
Josey, say something, my dear.

49:16.536 --> 49:19.122
I like women,
to be able to grab the right dose.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.248
I am Néichster!

49:20.248 --> 49:23.168
If we drink the soup now, we can
tomorrow we will defeat the black world.

49:23.251 --> 49:24.836
- Right?
- Not so fast.

49:25.170 --> 49:27.172
I'm not,
how long the effect lasts.

49:27.422 --> 49:30.383
It's better if you first
drinking shortly before the fight.

49:30.592 --> 49:31.593
Good idea.

49:31.676 --> 49:34.012
I wonder,
who should guard the potion well.

49:35.472 --> 49:36.723
Sure, the Stéstenste of us.

49:45.899 --> 49:47.192
Are you alright, darling?

49:48.401 --> 49:50.570
Am I doing the right thing here?

49:50.862 --> 49:52.238
By killing them all?

49:52.864 --> 49:55.325
Maybe we should have escaped,
when we still had the chance.

49:56.034 --> 49:58.661
Does Gark lie with what he says
because really so wrong?

49:59.120 --> 50:01.581
We resist, of course
the laws of nature.

50:01.664 --> 50:05.919
Wish it Iieber, again in one
To feed and hunt packs of wolves?

50:06.044 --> 50:07.420
Honestly, I'm a lot of Iieber.

50:07.545 --> 50:09.589
You changed us, Gray.
All of us.

50:09.756 --> 50:12.342
You proved that even
wild predators like us,

50:12.425 --> 50:15.678
can change and how civilized
Sheep can be if we want.

50:15.678 --> 50:19.224
And usually helpless sheep
can assert themselves against predators.

50:19.641 --> 50:22.393
I think we can do it,
when you start us.

50:22.685 --> 50:25.271
We could even have an army of
Defeat Sibelian Tigers,

50:25.438 --> 50:26.981
let alone the black Wélfe.

50:27.106 --> 50:29.192
You are the Iegendéire Gray.

50:29.192 --> 50:32.820
Leader of the first united village
of sheep and wolves.

50:33.947 --> 50:35.323
That was so epic.

50:35.406 --> 50:37.617
You're like Belgour, just as my wife.

50:38.034 --> 50:40.036
I do not mean because of age.
No, I mean because of your wisdom.

50:40.036 --> 50:42.747
And your speech was so powerful
and inspiring.

50:42.872 --> 50:44.791
Gray, I'm serious.

50:44.999 --> 50:46.000
Just like me.

50:46.000 --> 50:49.170
Tomorrow I will be this
teach black Wijlfen a lesson.

51:13.945 --> 51:16.197
What a romantic night.

51:19.492 --> 51:21.035
Do not you agree?

51:29.377 --> 51:31.921
You are always so calm.

51:32.380 --> 51:34.966
You have something Mysteriéses about you.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.927
I saw you directly.

51:37.927 --> 51:39.929
You are not like the other sheep.

51:40.263 --> 51:41.264
It is obvious.

51:41.347 --> 51:43.308
You are, you are,

51:43.641 --> 51:44.767
unique.

51:45.226 --> 51:47.729
I have never met anyone yet
as you met.

51:47.895 --> 51:51.316
I can imagine you such
Compliments are churning out.

51:51.441 --> 51:53.735
And I'm just a regular buck.

51:53.776 --> 51:55.570
What do you want with me?

51:56.946 --> 51:57.947
Are you hungry?

51:58.197 --> 51:59.324
Wait a moment.

52:01.367 --> 52:02.702
Here, grab it.

52:02.827 --> 52:05.872
If I'm honest, I already have it
made for you a long time ago.

52:05.997 --> 52:08.124
But I never dared
to give it to you.

52:08.249 --> 52:10.376
There are two joys in my life.

52:10.543 --> 52:11.711
Eat and...

52:12.211 --> 52:13.254
And...

52:13.463 --> 52:16.299
Well, everyone here is always praising me
for my homemade food.

52:16.341 --> 52:17.467
Serve yourself.

52:17.884 --> 52:20.386
Chamomile cake and cake.

52:23.264 --> 52:25.266
You do not like her, right?

52:25.683 --> 52:26.684
Of course not.

52:26.768 --> 52:30.897
What does a beautiful sheep want?
as you also with my normal pies.

52:31.814 --> 52:33.566
I understand already.

52:42.408 --> 52:43.409
You still like her.

52:43.743 --> 52:46.245
That makes me so happy.
I'm so happy.

52:46.287 --> 52:47.747
I bake more of it.

52:50.500 --> 52:55.213
I love your murder appetite so much.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.092
Do you want more?

52:59.175 --> 53:02.679
Super. Let's go.
I have so much food at home.

53:19.821 --> 53:21.948
All the talk about food,

53:22.031 --> 53:24.117
we completely forgot
to guard the potion.

53:24.575 --> 53:25.576
Wait a moment!

53:31.999 --> 53:33.459
I forgot the Léffel.

53:36.212 --> 53:37.505
Well then everything is all right.

53:37.922 --> 53:42.135
It will not be with all the food
Be a problem to sit here until tomorrow.

54:21.299 --> 54:22.300
Friends!

54:22.341 --> 54:23.968
What awaits you here today?

54:24.135 --> 54:27.388
A kind enemy,
who wants to destroy our lifestyle?

54:27.638 --> 54:30.099
Do you see a dangerous threat?
to approach us?

54:30.266 --> 54:32.435
No, I do not see her.

54:32.685 --> 54:34.020
I see a family.

54:34.312 --> 54:36.189
A village of Wélfen and sheep.

54:36.272 --> 54:39.525
They are in peace and friendship
come together.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.779
Together we cajole against tyranny.

54:43.196 --> 54:45.698
Together we can achieve everything.

54:45.865 --> 54:47.742
Nobody can take that away from us!

54:48.284 --> 54:49.577
Keep your tears ready.

55:00.338 --> 55:01.339
Drink!

55:07.345 --> 55:08.346
What?

55:21.776 --> 55:22.777
No!

55:27.490 --> 55:29.242
Déimlicher Kléiffer.

55:29.325 --> 55:32.912
You thought, the Tréinke the gypsy
help you win

55:33.621 --> 55:37.250
but I was you all the time
one step ahead.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.085
Surprise.

55:39.168 --> 55:40.169
You were that?

55:41.045 --> 55:42.255
That's right, Gray.

55:42.463 --> 55:44.715
The potion, the fortress and the training.

55:44.799 --> 55:46.592
- That was all me.
- But why?

55:46.926 --> 55:49.220
Sheep and wolves can not
living together.

55:49.345 --> 55:50.930
This is against the laws of nature.

55:51.138 --> 55:52.139
Do not you see that?

55:52.431 --> 55:53.432
I almost became crazy.

55:53.516 --> 55:56.936
Ive even with the grass-eaters
to take orders from them.

55:57.144 --> 55:58.354
Gark understands that.

55:58.396 --> 55:59.772
It's because we're superior.

56:00.857 --> 56:01.858
Skinny.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.776
- Hobbler?
- How could you?

56:04.485 --> 56:05.862
Look at your family now.

56:06.028 --> 56:07.446
I only wanted
everything will be like frijnher again.

56:07.530 --> 56:08.698
As it should be mijsste.

56:08.739 --> 56:09.866
That's enough now.

56:10.032 --> 56:12.827
No! Everything is getting better now.

56:12.952 --> 56:16.038
Lock him up.
Drive all pigs together.

56:16.080 --> 56:18.291
Tonight there is a feast!

56:18.332 --> 56:20.334
Wait. What? No!

56:20.543 --> 56:24.088
I thought we want the community
just disconnect, so that everything is as frijher.

56:24.297 --> 56:26.257
Disconnecting does not heal us
equate with us, kid.

56:26.382 --> 56:27.550
But the agreement?

56:27.633 --> 56:29.510
I have not agreed to any agreement.

56:29.677 --> 56:32.972
I owe you nothing.
Wélfe do not owe anything to anyone.

56:33.014 --> 56:35.224
But you, on the other hand, are a Verréiter.

56:35.391 --> 56:38.394
And Verréiter are worse
as a grass eater.

56:38.436 --> 56:40.730
Lock him up to Gray,
I'll take care of him later.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.024
If she does that then
did not already declare yourself.

56:44.483 --> 56:46.485
And find this lousy Héisin.

56:53.659 --> 56:55.536
What have I done? What have
I only done that?

56:55.828 --> 56:58.414
Hobbler! My friend!
They will eat him up.

56:58.581 --> 57:00.374
They will eat them all!

57:00.416 --> 57:02.418
That's not what I wanted.

57:02.835 --> 57:04.420
Gray, do something!

57:04.670 --> 57:06.005
Why do not you say anything?

57:06.297 --> 57:07.465
That's all my fault.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.425
Do something! Something's!

57:09.717 --> 57:11.552
I thought you were the hero,
they always talk about.

57:11.886 --> 57:13.721
Yes. Exactly...

57:13.763 --> 57:16.015
You are also a hero.
You have to save us all.

57:16.933 --> 57:19.393
How could I believe
that Gark is right?

57:19.435 --> 57:21.604
Hobbler, forgive me.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.814
That's all my fault.

57:24.231 --> 57:26.233
No, it's my fault.

57:26.233 --> 57:27.234
What?

57:27.777 --> 57:30.154
We should have fled,
when we still had the chance.

57:31.447 --> 57:33.991
I thought,
we could kevimp side by side.

57:34.575 --> 57:36.202
I'm such an idiot.

57:36.827 --> 57:41.499
Now all the Iies have to eat
and it's all my fault.

57:41.791 --> 57:43.542
No. Gray, that's not true!

57:43.751 --> 57:45.628
I mean, you were right,
But now you are wrong.

57:45.878 --> 57:48.714
If I did not help Gark,
Did you win?

57:48.798 --> 57:52.343
Everyone came together and got the fortress
built until I broke it.

57:52.718 --> 57:54.804
All together were a team.

57:54.887 --> 57:59.308
And me, we, together we can
still defeating the black Wijlfe.

58:00.685 --> 58:03.104
You're right.
We all worked together.

58:03.187 --> 58:04.563
Maybe we still have
a chance.

58:05.022 --> 58:06.691
Now the tail is
not collected.

58:06.691 --> 58:08.317
- Yes!
- It's time to kéimpfen!

58:08.442 --> 58:10.528
Yes! Yes! Excellent! What do we do first?

58:11.570 --> 58:12.989
Okay, I deserve that.

58:13.489 --> 58:15.700
- First we must come out here.
- But how?

58:15.741 --> 58:17.243
Maybe I can break the door.

58:17.368 --> 58:21.163
No chance. That's Belgor's shed.
The TiJr is really solid.

58:21.288 --> 58:22.832
We could get your head
to use as a battering ram.

58:22.957 --> 58:25.751
I do not think so, that ...
Yes, I probably deserve that too.

58:43.144 --> 58:45.396
That is impossible.
Do you have an idea?

58:45.646 --> 58:48.232
- We have to think in peace.
- How should that help us?

58:48.399 --> 58:50.276
Well, that may be enough
then something.

58:50.359 --> 58:53.696
S0? What?
A spell? "Abracadabra"?

58:57.700 --> 59:00.453
Josey! You little cute genius!

59:00.578 --> 59:02.413
Mummy's potion is still working.

59:03.205 --> 59:05.875
The magic potion. That's it!
I'm where we took him.

59:06.083 --> 59:08.961
- And?
- And we can still use it.

59:08.961 --> 59:11.547
Also as pigs we can
defeat the Wélfe. Certainly!

59:11.672 --> 59:13.841
That's the right attitude.
Josey and you, you bring the potion.

59:13.883 --> 59:15.634
I'll fight for Gark.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.136
Are you sure?

59:17.261 --> 59:18.637
He will kill you.

59:18.637 --> 59:21.390
I will do what is necessary,
to stop him.

59:22.725 --> 59:24.852
Let me say one thing.

59:25.978 --> 59:30.066
Our way is the only right one.

59:30.274 --> 59:32.068
Wélfe are Jéiger.

59:32.401 --> 59:34.278
Sheep are prey.

59:34.528 --> 59:36.906
Very easily.

59:36.947 --> 59:38.991
And if the Wélfe itself
want to join the sheep,

59:39.200 --> 59:41.577
then they become prey too.

59:43.329 --> 59:45.206
But that does not matter now.

59:45.456 --> 59:48.125
Yours now anyway
only dirty pigs.

59:49.710 --> 59:55.132
No one contradicts or opposes
the mighty Gark!

59:56.509 --> 59:59.929
Wow! Such remarkable words!

01:00:00.012 --> 01:00:01.222
Nobody contradicts me!

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:02.473
What a speech.

01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:04.058
Just as predicted.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.227
- A strong kick in the butt.
- Keep your mouth shut!

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.479
That's not how you talk to a lady.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:14.777
Is the mighty Gark about wiitend?

01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:16.403
W0 are you?

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:18.447
Right here!

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:19.615
Grab him!

01:00:21.075 --> 01:00:22.368
That was close.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:25.996
Too slow.

01:00:28.582 --> 01:00:31.043
Let it stay. I'll do it myself.

01:00:31.752 --> 01:00:32.753
Can you hijren me?

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.713
I will personally kill you.

01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:38.300
Well, well then let's get started, mate.

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.847
It's time. Now it's our turn.

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:56.337
We prefer to wait.

01:02:27.409 --> 01:02:28.410
Have a drink.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:39.880
Hello.

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:52.977
You have to try them.

01:02:59.441 --> 01:03:01.026
Close miss. Drift here.

01:03:20.129 --> 01:03:22.214
Yes, you are faster than you look.

01:03:22.464 --> 01:03:26.093
Run away from the responsibility
was a good workout.

01:03:26.927 --> 01:03:29.138
You will never enter
be a strong leader.

01:03:29.638 --> 01:03:32.099
If a strong leader something
Looks naughty,

01:03:32.349 --> 01:03:33.684
then he destroys it.

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:39.064
No, a good leader
to stand up for the right thing.

01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:07.426
Mum, please go to the side.

01:04:07.509 --> 01:04:09.553
We do not want to hurt you.
This is not your fight.

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:11.680
Why are you doing this at all?

01:04:11.764 --> 01:04:14.850
Dee, intolerance is not yours.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.935
You should wear something Grijnes to Iever.

01:04:17.102 --> 01:04:20.189
Dum, with your shoes
Do you knit such scarfs.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.608
Why are you using it?
for violence?

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:26.570
The villagers may be able to help you
also teach something about knitting.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.323
Gustav, you love fishing.

01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:32.576
And many from the pack,
that stands here in front of you, as well.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:35.287
You may be right, mommy.

01:04:35.537 --> 01:04:37.456
But what about the laws of nature?

01:04:37.831 --> 01:04:40.751
Wels are Jéiger, sheep are not.

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:41.794
Listen.

01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:45.422
I see, how it starts,
to be forced to the predator.

01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:48.801
My whole life
have all seen me as a predator.

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.511
As a carnivorous fox.

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:51.970
But deep inside

01:04:52.137 --> 01:04:53.889
I really only want one thing:

01:04:54.306 --> 01:04:55.682
Be a botanist.

01:04:55.766 --> 01:05:00.938
And maybe I can
finally being myself.

01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:04.566
Well, maybe you can here too
that's what you really want to be.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.360
It would be worth a try.

01:05:06.693 --> 01:05:07.903
What do you say to that?

01:05:08.278 --> 01:05:10.197
Yes!

01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.271
You do it to me.

01:05:42.729 --> 01:05:44.398
You are so filled with hate,

01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.817
that you own it yourself
you can not find her Glilck.

01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:48.652
Even if it's none of your business.

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:53.073
No! You do it to me!

01:05:53.615 --> 01:05:55.868
Your sentimentality makes you small.

01:05:56.034 --> 01:05:58.036
You protect the weakest
the weak.

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.080
W0 did that take you now?

01:06:01.331 --> 01:06:02.374
I tell you.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:11.341
To the very bottom! Just like you!

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:14.136
We have to fight for them,
the anclers are as we are.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.890
That's the only law of nature,
I follow.

01:06:18.682 --> 01:06:20.225
Leave him in peace.

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:22.728
Is that really serious?

01:06:23.103 --> 01:06:25.647
You choose the way of the weak!

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:28.400
Give up. It's over!

01:06:30.777 --> 01:06:32.362
Past? No!

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.907
It's over for you!

01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:38.619
No! Not the magic potion!

01:06:54.676 --> 01:06:56.720
I will show you!
I'll show you all!

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:07.231
Well, you little Fratz!

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:36.927
Good morning World!

01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:41.557
And so the great leader Gray
proved once again

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:45.852
that good is more important than brute force.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.647
He brought
the different parts together.

01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:50.732
With her newly found peace,

01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:53.777
they were happier than ever.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.945
And as you would expect,

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:57.656
also helped the beautiful,
brilliant, clever

01:07:57.906 --> 01:08:01.451
and absolutely amazing
Héisin Mami,

01:08:01.577 --> 01:08:04.037
to rebuild the city.

01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:07.249
Furthermore, she continued to give knitting courses.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.054
What would you do without me?
