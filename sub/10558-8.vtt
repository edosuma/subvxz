00:47.230 --> 00:49.090
These need to go in
the post immediately.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.850
Oh, and do you have a new pen?
This nib's all clogged up.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.230
Ma'am, I understand,
I sympathise, and I want

00:54.230 --> 00:56.890
you to know I'll do everything I can
to get to the bottom of the matter.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.430
I'm a dog owner myself.

00:58.430 --> 01:01.130
Anyway, you take very good care.

01:01.130 --> 01:04.830
What was that about? Oh, sir, seems
the woman's dog has gone missing.

01:04.830 --> 01:07.550
Oh, and you're going to investigate?
Well, I believe it behoves me.

01:07.550 --> 01:10.570
Crabtree, you don't have time to
go chasing after dogs. There are

01:10.570 --> 01:13.090
more pressing matters to hand. Well,
sir, it's not just the one animal.

01:13.090 --> 01:15.330
Several dogs have gone missing
from this woman's neighbourhood.

01:15.330 --> 01:17.690
It's most likely the work
of a dog-napper.

01:17.690 --> 01:20.170
Most likely the bloody things
are in heat and have just run off.

01:20.170 --> 01:23.130
But, sir...
Crabtree, no wasting your time

01:23.130 --> 01:25.470
on wild dog chases. Understood? Sir.

01:25.470 --> 01:30.890
"Dog-napper"! Oh, Detective?
An envelope brought for you

01:30.890 --> 01:33.130
a short while ago.

01:33.130 --> 01:36.510
I couldn't help but notice
there's no return address.

01:36.510 --> 01:39.230
Any other keen observations,
Constable? Actually, yes, sir.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.090
It's scented of lilac.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.290
At least, I believe that's lilac.
Er, my aunt was very...

01:43.290 --> 01:46.850
Yes, your aunt. ..was fond of lilac.

01:46.850 --> 01:48.930
"Dear Sir, you are cordially invited

01:48.930 --> 01:51.550
"to an event that
will change the future

01:51.550 --> 01:54.870
"to be held in High Park this
evening at seven o'clock."

01:54.870 --> 01:57.590
The invitation said nothing
about bringing a guest, William.

01:57.590 --> 02:00.350
It said nothing about
not bringing one, either.

02:00.350 --> 02:04.630
It's rather exciting, attending an
event with no idea as to its purpose.

02:04.630 --> 02:06.410
Or where it's to be held.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.830
Although I suspect we've found it.

02:13.250 --> 02:17.110
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS
CHATTERING

02:17.110 --> 02:22.310
And you have no idea what this
is all about? None whatsoever.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.330
Father promised something
most astounding.

02:25.330 --> 02:27.290
"Wouldn't miss it for
the world," he said.

02:27.290 --> 02:29.670
Oh, William, I think every professor,

02:29.670 --> 02:31.710
doctor and scientist
in the city is here.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.730
Mm, a who's who of the
intelligentsia. Julia?

02:34.730 --> 02:39.250
Drius! How good to see you! Dr Drius
Algar, Detective William Murdoch.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.130
Pleased to meet you. The same.

02:41.130 --> 02:42.690
It is still Doctor, isn't it?

02:42.690 --> 02:47.330
Only in title. I spend most of
my time these days researching.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.570
Champagne? I'd be delighted.

02:49.570 --> 02:53.190
Detective? No, thank you. Thank you!

02:59.670 --> 03:01.450
Detective?

03:01.450 --> 03:03.770
I see you received my invitation.

03:03.770 --> 03:05.750
Mrs Pendrick! It was you?

03:05.750 --> 03:08.690
And I see you brought a guest.

03:08.690 --> 03:11.070
How wonderful.

03:11.070 --> 03:14.130
Might I ask what
this event is in honour of?

03:14.130 --> 03:16.670
My husband is about
to make matters clear.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
might I have your attention?

03:18.890 --> 03:21.570
Good evening, and
thank you all for coming.

03:21.570 --> 03:24.390
For those of you who don't know,
my name is James Pendrick...

03:24.390 --> 03:26.230
Excuse me. ..and for some
time now, a small group

03:26.230 --> 03:28.550
of like-minded individuals has met.

03:28.550 --> 03:33.430
We share a common interest,
the science of eugenics.

03:33.430 --> 03:38.730
Eugenics is the investigation into
the conditions under which men and
women of a high type are produced.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.610
Now, how is this to be achieved?

03:40.610 --> 03:43.330
We know that by mating
only the best with the best,

03:43.330 --> 03:46.230
any species grows stronger. The
principle's plainly seen in nature,

03:46.230 --> 03:50.270
as Mr Charles Darwin has pointed
out in his theory of evolution.

03:50.270 --> 03:54.010
Why, then, might not the same
principle be applied to mankind?

03:54.010 --> 03:56.130
Yes, why not? Hear, hear!

03:58.250 --> 04:00.650
Rip, c'mon! Here, Rip.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.150
Here, Rip.

04:04.050 --> 04:06.470
Hey! Get out of that, you!

04:06.470 --> 04:09.730
Now our humble group is asking
you, the city's leading minds,

04:09.730 --> 04:13.510
to join us in the noble cause
of bettering the human race.

04:13.510 --> 04:18.850
Now, the last thing you want to
do is to hear me prattling on.

04:18.850 --> 04:22.089
So to explain matters further, I
have invited a very special guest,

04:22.089 --> 04:26.750
no less than the great author
and eugenicist Mr HG Wells.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.850
Julia? Standing with
Mr Wells, isn't that...?

04:32.850 --> 04:36.390
My sister, Ruby. Yes.

04:37.850 --> 04:40.410
Rip, c'mon. Hey, come back here!

04:40.410 --> 04:44.010
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
It is my distinct pleasure to...

04:44.010 --> 04:46.210
SCREAMING

04:49.010 --> 04:51.910
Oh, my! Drop it.

04:59.170 --> 05:01.750
George,
we'll need to organise a search

05:01.750 --> 05:03.670
in case there are more appendages.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.430
I'll have the men get some grappling
hooks in the water straightaway.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.290
How unexpected to
find you here, Ruby.

05:09.290 --> 05:13.110
I hoped my arrival would be
a surprise, but it would seem
I've been upstaged.

05:13.110 --> 05:17.010
I thought you were still
travelling around the world
and writing about Harry Houdini.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.070
A fascinating young man,

05:19.070 --> 05:21.550
but it was time to return
to my work with Mr Wells.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.810
Oh, Bertie? Your work. Of course.

05:23.810 --> 05:27.530
Bertie, there's someone I'd like you
to meet. No need for introductions.

05:27.530 --> 05:29.970
Miss Julia Ogden, I presume.

05:29.970 --> 05:31.670
Charmed.

05:31.670 --> 05:34.810
Why, the same!

05:34.810 --> 05:36.410
There you are, Doctor.

05:36.410 --> 05:40.710
The, er, appendage is now all yours.

05:40.710 --> 05:42.970
Of course. If you'll excuse me.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.370
Certainly.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.110
Hello again, Miss Ogden.

05:47.110 --> 05:50.130
Detective Murdoch, please meet
Mr HG Wells. Yes, of course.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.650
It's a pleasure. I am a fan.

05:52.650 --> 05:55.670
As am I of you. Ruby has told
me all about your exploits.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.650
Oh! Has she?

05:57.650 --> 06:00.130
Indeed.

06:00.130 --> 06:03.730
I'm afraid I can't give you an
accurate time of death, William.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.470
The water makes it
impossible to pinpoint.

06:06.470 --> 06:10.730
Could the limb have been taken from
a corpse, say a medical cadaver?

06:10.730 --> 06:12.390
There's very little indication.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.890
It was either taken from someone
very recently deceased or...

06:15.890 --> 06:17.950
..or someone who was still alive.

06:17.950 --> 06:22.370
If that were the case, could
they have survived the procedure?

06:22.370 --> 06:24.170
Not without receiving
medical attention immediately.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.530
Yes, we checked
all of the hospitals.

06:26.530 --> 06:29.270
No-one with this type of injury
was treated.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.370
Then it's very unlikely they lived.

06:31.370 --> 06:35.990
Hm. Can you tell me
anything else about the victim?

06:35.990 --> 06:37.730
A little. A male.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.350
Judging by the size of the
limb, over six feet in height.

06:40.350 --> 06:42.570
The blotchy skin
suggests someone over fifty.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.470
And given the arm hair, a blond.

06:45.470 --> 06:48.950
Hands are smooth.
He want a labourer. Anything else?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.450
Whoever performed the dismemberment
may have had knowledge

06:51.450 --> 06:53.470
of anatomy and surgical technique.

06:53.470 --> 06:56.490
A number of the guests at the
eugenics meeting were doctors

06:56.490 --> 07:00.650
and scientists who no doubt would
have had the necessary training.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.310
I know many of them personally.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.890
I couldn't imagine a single one
committing such a terrible act.

07:04.890 --> 07:07.670
Hm. Yet they must be considered.

07:07.670 --> 07:11.930
Even so, surely they would have
disposed of the limb somewhere
less obvious. True.

07:11.930 --> 07:15.070
It may be a coincidence, it may not.

07:15.070 --> 07:17.410
Thank you, Julia.
I'll begin my investigation

07:17.410 --> 07:20.470
by searching for missing persons
matching your description.

07:20.470 --> 07:25.290
It's intriguing, the notion
of bettering the human race. Hm.

07:25.290 --> 07:29.890
But it's as if we were discussing
a prize stallion breeding a mare.

07:29.890 --> 07:32.710
Not that
that wouldn't be intriguing as well.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.630
Theoretically.

07:34.630 --> 07:38.210
Well, husbandry has been
practised for centuries.

07:38.210 --> 07:40.510
Mm. Yes, it has.

07:43.370 --> 07:44.950
Well, I must be off.

07:44.950 --> 07:47.290
Yes. Good evening.

07:47.290 --> 07:48.930
Good evening.

08:03.473 --> 08:05.533
Er, Detective?

08:05.533 --> 08:09.993
Sir, this is Miss Estelle Malling
and her fiance, Tobias Allan.

08:09.993 --> 08:13.053
Miss Malling. Mr Allan.
How may I be of assistance?

08:13.053 --> 08:17.513
It seems Miss Malling's father,
Linus, has gone missing.

08:17.513 --> 08:19.533
Linus Malling? The barrister?

08:19.533 --> 08:22.273
Yes.
He didn't return home last night.

08:22.273 --> 08:24.093
Estelle, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation.

08:24.093 --> 08:27.353
Miss Malling, could you
describe your father to me?

08:27.353 --> 08:29.293
He's 54, tall, six foot two inches...

08:29.293 --> 08:31.133
Blond?

08:31.133 --> 08:34.293
Why, yes. Do you know something
of his whereabouts, Detective?

08:35.913 --> 08:40.732
Well, I cannot be certain.
I'm afraid it's possible
I have some disturbing news.

08:45.253 --> 08:48.833
Please start from the
beginning, Miss Malling.

08:48.833 --> 08:54.793
I last saw Father yesterday morning
after breakfast when he left for his
office, as he always does.

08:54.793 --> 08:57.533
Was anything troubling him? Nothing.

08:57.533 --> 09:02.033
The only thing bothering him was a
cold. His head was stuffed terribly.

09:02.033 --> 09:05.853
We should have known something was
wrong when he failed to attend
the eugenics meeting.

09:05.853 --> 09:09.773
He'd have never missed the affair.
Oh? Why not?

09:09.773 --> 09:12.393
After all of his years in court,
Linus was a believer in the need

09:12.393 --> 09:15.133
to rid the human race
of criminal behaviour.

09:15.133 --> 09:18.093
And he saw eugenics
as a means to that end?

09:18.093 --> 09:21.333
He felt that could only
be achieved by never allowing
criminals to breed again.

09:23.013 --> 09:25.633
I take it you both
adhere to this belief.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.873
It's only logical.

09:29.513 --> 09:31.853
Did Mr Malling have any enemies?

09:31.853 --> 09:33.773
Oh, there were disgruntled clients.

09:33.773 --> 09:37.213
But that's to be expected with
any lawyer. Any recent arguments?

09:37.213 --> 09:41.933
Now that you mention it, I overheard
Father quarrelling in his study.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.533
With whom?

09:46.193 --> 09:48.433
The head of the Eugenics Society.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.573
James Pendrick, eh? Yes. And given

09:50.573 --> 09:53.633
my suspicion of his involvement
in the art heist and murders...

09:53.633 --> 09:56.413
A suspicion harboured only by you.
Yes, but Mr Pendrick may have...

09:56.413 --> 09:59.153
Yes, yes, yes, orchestrated
the theft for his own benefit.

09:59.153 --> 10:00.853
Murdoch, the man saved your life.

10:00.853 --> 10:02.993
Mm. And in doing so prevented me

10:02.993 --> 10:06.253
from discovering who was actually
behind the Rembrandt affair.

10:06.253 --> 10:09.073
The simple answer is
staring you in the face.

10:09.073 --> 10:11.373
Linus Malling represented
a lot of bad apples.

10:11.373 --> 10:15.733
Most likely one of them didn't
agree with his defence.

10:15.733 --> 10:21.513
Perhaps, but I would venture few
of them had the skills necessary to
dismember the victim. Point taken.

10:21.513 --> 10:24.253
And you must allow it is odd Mr
Pendrick's name would come up again.

10:24.253 --> 10:26.853
Fine. Look into Pendrick as well.

10:26.853 --> 10:29.333
But I'll tell you what's odd.
It's this whole eugenics business.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.313
Pure bloodlines?

10:31.313 --> 10:33.033
We already practised it.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.073
Now, if that's bettering the
human race, I want no part of it.

10:36.073 --> 10:39.073
Hm, matches. Matches...

10:40.613 --> 10:44.713
George? I take it nothing
was found at the pond.

10:44.713 --> 10:47.073
No, not yet, sir, but the
lads still have a ways to go.

10:47.073 --> 10:51.133
Very well. In the meantime, find out
all you can about Linus Malling's

10:51.133 --> 10:54.953
recent cases and see if anyone had
made any threats toward the man.

10:54.953 --> 10:57.593
Sir. Right away.

10:57.593 --> 10:59.613
Oh, Inspector, might I have a word?

10:59.613 --> 11:01.673
It's not the bloody
dog-nappings again?

11:01.673 --> 11:06.913
Well, sir, I've looked into the
matter further, and I've determined
that all the victims... Victims?!

11:06.913 --> 11:12.033
Sir, all the victims are either
pure-breds or with pup. Now...

11:12.033 --> 11:15.753
Crabtree, I don't want you
investigating these dog-nappings.

11:15.753 --> 11:18.253
Is that clear?

11:18.253 --> 11:20.573
Matches, matches... Transparently.

11:29.353 --> 11:32.253
Detective Murdoch!

11:32.253 --> 11:36.993
I am pleased to see the
constabulary has assigned such
a competent officer to the case.

11:36.993 --> 11:38.913
I'll try to be brief, Mr Pendrick.

11:38.913 --> 11:42.413
I understand you had words
last week with Mr Malling.

11:42.413 --> 11:44.553
Linus? Exchanged words?

11:44.553 --> 11:47.793
What has he got to do with matters?

11:47.793 --> 11:50.273
My God!

11:50.273 --> 11:52.073
It was his arm.

11:52.073 --> 11:54.093
I believe so.

11:54.093 --> 11:55.753
Please, answer the question.

11:55.753 --> 12:00.913
Are you suggesting that I had
something to do with this? Yes.

12:00.913 --> 12:02.693
Yes, you are.

12:02.693 --> 12:04.233
Why, this is preposterous.
I would never...

12:04.233 --> 12:06.633
The question remains unanswered.

12:06.633 --> 12:08.213
Very well.

12:08.213 --> 12:10.113
We had a disagreement.

12:10.113 --> 12:11.933
Linus is a...

12:11.933 --> 12:14.153
Linus WAS a real stick-in-the-mud

12:14.153 --> 12:16.593
when it came to matter
regarding science and eugenics.

12:16.593 --> 12:20.553
Science? Do you know what
transformationism is, Detective?

12:20.553 --> 12:26.133
It's the heart of the evolutionary
argument, that a species over many
generations can be modified.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.833
Very good. I'm a firm
believer in transformationism.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.153
I'm also convinced that,
by applying modern science -
surgery, chemistry -

12:33.153 --> 12:37.253
what took nature millions of years
to accomplish, we can achieve
in a single generation.

12:37.253 --> 12:40.273
The means to do so don't exist. Yet.

12:40.273 --> 12:42.933
But it's only a matter of time.

12:42.933 --> 12:45.893
To that end,
I fund many scientific projects.

12:45.893 --> 12:48.553
A better man is within our grasp.

12:48.553 --> 12:51.273
And I take it Mr Malling
disagreed with you.

12:51.273 --> 12:55.273
Linus felt selective breeding
was the only means
of achieving our goal.

12:55.273 --> 12:57.353
So you quarrelled about this.

12:57.353 --> 13:00.893
"Quarrelled"! No, it was merely
a healthy discourse, nothing more.

13:00.893 --> 13:03.013
I would never have harmed Linus.

13:03.013 --> 13:05.873
And I'm to simply take
your word for this?

13:05.873 --> 13:08.253
The criminal act is a blemish

13:08.253 --> 13:12.013
I intend not to perpetuate,
but remove from society.

13:12.013 --> 13:15.313
I share your goal, sir.

13:15.313 --> 13:18.913
I'll see myself out.
 Yes, please do.

13:29.513 --> 13:31.413
Detective!

13:31.413 --> 13:33.473
Is this a social call?

13:33.473 --> 13:36.593
I'll leave that to your husband
to explain, Mrs Pendrick.

13:36.593 --> 13:38.853
Mm, how cryptic!

13:38.853 --> 13:41.113
Nevertheless,
I trust you will be attending

13:41.113 --> 13:43.653
our rescheduled eugenics meeting.

13:43.653 --> 13:47.433
I've not been invited.
An oversight on James's part.

13:47.433 --> 13:51.653
No doubt. Well, consider
this a personal invitation.

13:51.653 --> 13:54.813
Then I wouldn't dream of missing it.
Excellent.

13:54.813 --> 13:58.653
No, you heard me correctly.
I'm in need of an adult male brain.

13:58.653 --> 14:00.873
Yes, they're difficult
to find, I understand.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.333
Yes. Why, thank you.

14:04.353 --> 14:08.333
Dr Ogden.
Mr Wells! I didn't hear you.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.713
Oh, there is no need for apologies.

14:11.713 --> 14:14.473
Whatever brings you to
my cheery little office?

14:14.473 --> 14:18.953
I came to personally
invite you to hear my address,
rescheduled for this evening.

14:18.953 --> 14:22.453
Well, thank you, but I'm
afraid I'm rather busy with work.

14:22.453 --> 14:27.213
I would be grateful if you
could find the time to attend.

14:27.213 --> 14:30.933
Well then, I shall be there.
Very good.

14:30.933 --> 14:34.673
Is there something else, Mr Wells?
Yes.

14:34.673 --> 14:39.693
I find you most intriguing, Julia,
your accomplishments astounding.

14:39.693 --> 14:43.093
I see. Well, the most
interesting Ogden is my sister.

14:43.093 --> 14:45.893
Clearly, all of the Ogden
women are of fine stock.

14:45.893 --> 14:49.673
Mr Wells, you're being far too
forward. What would Ruby think?

14:49.673 --> 14:52.493
Oh, she would not mind. She had
no objections to my marriage.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.513
You have a wife?

14:54.513 --> 14:57.373
Second wife, actually.

14:57.373 --> 15:01.293
But let's leave that
for later, shall we?

15:01.293 --> 15:03.573
Later... 
Until then.

15:15.573 --> 15:16.533
Ahem.

15:17.653 --> 15:19.573
Detective Murdoch!

15:19.573 --> 15:22.513
Miss Ogden. What brings you here?

15:22.513 --> 15:24.673
Why, you, of course! 
Me?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.253
I'm looking for another
piece to write and thought

15:27.253 --> 15:31.313
perhaps an expose on true crime
might interest the public.

15:31.313 --> 15:33.073
Rather dull, I should think.

15:33.073 --> 15:35.653
Not with an intriguing hero.

15:37.613 --> 15:40.033
Miss Ogden... Ruby, please.

15:40.033 --> 15:44.273
Ruby, I must remind you of what
happened when you inserted yourself

15:44.273 --> 15:46.473
in the Houdini case.

15:46.473 --> 15:48.873
I found the affair most titillating.

15:48.873 --> 15:51.213
Yes, I'm sure you did.

15:51.213 --> 15:54.093
Nevertheless, I fear I must decline.

15:54.093 --> 15:56.393
Oh, William... Excuse me, sir.

15:56.393 --> 15:59.273
Er, sir, the men may have
found something at the pond.

15:59.273 --> 16:01.233
Right. Please excuse me.

16:01.233 --> 16:03.273
Of course.

16:19.073 --> 16:23.573
The men were about to give up
when the grappling hooks snagged
something, sir. Good work.

16:23.573 --> 16:28.393
The sacks are very heavy. Weighted
down with rocks, no doubt. Most
likely. Let's have a look, shall we?

16:31.313 --> 16:33.313
What have we here, Detective?

16:33.313 --> 16:35.713
SHE FAINTS, SLUMPS TO GROUND

16:42.913 --> 16:46.053
Thank you.
 This should help.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.333
The inspector's private stock.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.733
I'm simply mortified.

16:52.733 --> 16:56.253
Fainting like a schoolgirl! Why,
the things I've seen and done...

16:56.253 --> 17:00.513
Yes, well, perhaps if you had
heeded my request,
none of this would have happened.

17:00.513 --> 17:02.473
There is no need to scold me.

17:02.473 --> 17:04.933
Well,
a scolding is what you deserve.

17:04.933 --> 17:09.373
I specifically asked you not to
insert yourself in any of my cases.

17:09.373 --> 17:14.012
Now, I'm afraid I must insist yet
again that you refrain from
doing so in the future.

17:14.012 --> 17:17.492
Very well.
Good. George, have you anything?

17:17.492 --> 17:19.173
Er, very little, I'm afraid, sir.

17:19.173 --> 17:21.992
The burlap sacks are come into
a dozen greeneries across the city,

17:21.992 --> 17:25.953
and the rocks seem to be
of no evidentiary value.

17:25.953 --> 17:27.752
I see.

17:27.752 --> 17:30.153
Well, I'm off to the morgue.

17:30.153 --> 17:33.333
Good day, Miss Ogden. 
Detective.

17:36.213 --> 17:40.413
If it's of any comfort, it still
turns my stomach to see such things.

17:42.033 --> 17:46.053
Crabtree! Sir? The alderman's
foxhound has been snatched.

17:46.053 --> 17:47.653
I thought you were dealing with this.
But, sir... No excuses.

17:47.653 --> 17:51.933
Sort it out once and for all.
Miss Ogden.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.733
Yes, sir.

17:54.813 --> 17:59.733
Not to worry. As usual,
I'm one step ahead of the inspector.

17:59.733 --> 18:02.773
I must bid you good day, Miss Ogden.

18:02.773 --> 18:04.533
Time is of the essence.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.453
I can confirm the remains
are those of Linus Malling.

18:10.453 --> 18:12.093
And the cause of death?

18:12.093 --> 18:14.993
Massive brain injury due to
numerous blows to the head.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.093
Hm. Any defensive wounds?

18:17.093 --> 18:19.293
There was no indication of any other
trauma. He was in perfect health

18:19.293 --> 18:23.113
except for a great deal
of mucus in his nasal passage.

18:23.113 --> 18:24.993
Ah, yes, his daughter mentioned

18:24.993 --> 18:27.953
he was suffering from
a terrible head cold.

18:27.953 --> 18:30.493
Is there something in the mucus?

18:30.493 --> 18:33.333
Yes. I believe it's pollen.
A clue to his final hours?

18:33.333 --> 18:35.873
Perhaps. May I keep this?

18:35.873 --> 18:37.993
Yes, of course.

18:37.993 --> 18:42.153
No-one else is likely to ask! I keep
returning to the Eugenics Society.

18:42.153 --> 18:46.193
So many in attendance had the skills
necessary to dismember a body.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.813
Yes, but for what possible motive?

18:48.813 --> 18:52.393
I'm not sure. But I'll be paying
close attention this evening.

18:52.393 --> 18:55.753
This evening? At Mr Wells' speech?

18:55.753 --> 18:58.513
Yes.
So you know it's been rescheduled.

18:58.513 --> 19:02.253
Er, Mr Wells invited me personally.
And you?

19:02.253 --> 19:05.193
Mrs Pendrick.

19:05.193 --> 19:07.453
I see. Well, good.

19:07.453 --> 19:09.713
Then we can attend with one another.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.653
Yes. Together.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.233
Shouldn't be long now, Higgins.

19:16.233 --> 19:18.513
Are you sure this plan'll work?

19:18.513 --> 19:20.053
Very confident.

19:20.053 --> 19:22.113
How can you be sure the
dog-napper will appear?

19:22.113 --> 19:25.153
Well, we know he steals expecting
dogs from this neighbourhood.

19:25.153 --> 19:27.173
I put up flyers saying that my dog

19:27.173 --> 19:29.793
is expecting pups and I'm
looking to get rid of them.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.853
All we have to do is wait.

19:31.853 --> 19:35.633
The culprit is as good as cuffed.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.093
I don't know about this.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.253
Listen, I think it'd be
best if you went home.

19:40.253 --> 19:43.253
The inspector's been very
mercurial about this investigation.

19:43.253 --> 19:45.033
I don't want you getting
in trouble on my account.

19:45.033 --> 19:46.653
Are you sure? 
I'm positive.

19:50.313 --> 19:52.593
Consider the dog.

19:52.593 --> 19:57.813
Through generations of
selected breeding, a cold-blooded
killer now guards its own prey.

19:58.913 --> 20:02.453
Imagine, if the same
can be done for mankind,

20:02.453 --> 20:05.793
what the future might entail.

20:08.553 --> 20:11.113
Sweet mother of...! Miss Ogden!

20:11.113 --> 20:12.993
I'm sorry I frightened you.

20:12.993 --> 20:17.333
That's OK. I was only frightened
because I was very intently focused

20:17.333 --> 20:20.173
on my dog there in that moment.
But of course you were.

20:20.173 --> 20:25.313
Perhaps some of you are
most familiar with my most
recent work, The Time Machine.

20:25.313 --> 20:27.873
APPLAUSE

20:27.873 --> 20:31.313
In it I portray a far-flung future
filled with the most dreadful

20:31.313 --> 20:37.253
remnants of humanity, monstrous
products of Darwinian evolution.

20:38.293 --> 20:40.593
It is a cautionary tale.

20:40.593 --> 20:43.593
The future need not be such.

20:43.593 --> 20:49.813
If we commit to eugenics, we can
control the evolution of mankind.

20:57.493 --> 20:59.593
Why are you here, Miss Ogden?

20:59.593 --> 21:01.633
Ruby, please.

21:01.633 --> 21:05.193
And I'm here because I'm intent on
writing a story about the realities

21:05.193 --> 21:07.333
of police investigation.

21:07.333 --> 21:11.113
No, I suspect you're really here
to get closer to Detective Murdoch.

21:11.113 --> 21:14.633
How could you accuse me of such a
thing? Why, I am cut to the quick!

21:14.633 --> 21:17.373
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Og... Ruby.

21:17.373 --> 21:22.513
But I simply don't believe you.
Hm... Someone in the yard. What?

21:22.513 --> 21:24.933
In the yard!

21:25.993 --> 21:27.973
My plan has worked.

21:27.973 --> 21:31.333
But why isn't your dog awake?
Now, that's a very good question,

21:31.333 --> 21:33.833
one that will be answered
in a while. A while?!

21:33.833 --> 21:35.813
Aren't you going to arrest him?

21:35.813 --> 21:38.733
I want him to lead me to
the rest of the animals.

21:38.733 --> 21:41.893
I guess there's no point
in telling you to stay put. None.

21:41.893 --> 21:44.133
Fair enough.

21:47.193 --> 21:49.533
Stay behind me.

21:52.690 --> 21:55.130
Miss Malling, Mr Allan.

21:55.130 --> 21:57.450
I'm surprised to see you here.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.170
Father would not want the
criminal element dictating our lives.

22:00.170 --> 22:04.170
The Eugenic Society, our wedding,
everything will go ahead as planned.

22:04.170 --> 22:08.270
Very brave of you. Detective, one
thing occurred to us after we left.

22:08.270 --> 22:12.410
It hadn't seemed important -
no raised voices or such.

22:12.410 --> 22:17.550
Anything might help.
About a week ago, a Eugenics
Society member visited Father.

22:17.550 --> 22:21.310
Afterwards, Father seemed a bit...
off.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.950
This Eugenics Society member,
who was he?

22:25.830 --> 22:27.770
It was Dr Algar.

22:30.930 --> 22:33.470
I see.

22:33.470 --> 22:35.330
Thank you. Please excuse me.

23:16.050 --> 23:18.990
CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS
CHATTERING

23:21.130 --> 23:24.290
Doctor?
I'm so pleased you could make it.

23:24.290 --> 23:27.710
I found your talk most interesting.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.610
I would love to hear your thoughts.
Perhaps over dinner?

23:30.610 --> 23:33.230
Oh! Well... Doctor?

23:33.230 --> 23:35.410
Mr Wells!

23:35.410 --> 23:37.370
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No, not at all.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.190
Your timing is impeccable.

23:39.190 --> 23:41.370
There's an urgent
matter I must attend to.

23:41.370 --> 23:44.290
Oh? Well, we must be off.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.470
Actually, it's work related.

23:46.470 --> 23:49.850
If it's not too much trouble,
I shall leave you in
Mr Wells' capable hands.

23:49.850 --> 23:52.250
No trouble at all, Detective.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.890
I'm most grateful, sir.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.270
Good evening.

23:59.010 --> 24:00.990
WHINING

24:03.710 --> 24:05.650
The missing dogs!

24:05.650 --> 24:08.030
At least a number of them.

24:11.370 --> 24:13.650
The alderman's foxhound.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.590
And yours!

24:19.610 --> 24:21.310
Drugged yet unharmed.

24:21.310 --> 24:23.970
But where's the dog-napper?

24:23.970 --> 24:26.810
Here, there's another room.

24:39.730 --> 24:42.910
My God! What is that?

24:45.730 --> 24:47.210
Dogs.

24:48.770 --> 24:50.830
Or at least...

24:50.830 --> 24:53.170
parts of them.

24:53.170 --> 24:54.630
How horrible!

24:57.230 --> 24:59.790
Is there something
I can help you with?

25:03.470 --> 25:07.090
Detective, I object to the
groundless treatment I am receiving.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.230
Groundless?

25:09.230 --> 25:13.310
Dr Algar, you have been stealing
and experimenting on dogs.

25:13.310 --> 25:18.570
Further, I'm investigating
the murder of a Eugenics Society
member who was expertly dismembered.

25:18.570 --> 25:23.430
You, sir, belong to the same society
and possess expert surgical skills.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.990
What possible reason would
I have to murder Linus?

25:25.990 --> 25:29.450
You and the victim met
shortly before his death.

25:29.450 --> 25:32.530
He was deeply upset by something
that transpired in that meeting.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.830
That is nonsense. Really?

25:34.830 --> 25:37.990
Convince me.
I had no idea the dogs were stolen!

25:37.990 --> 25:39.950
I hired a local to
acquire them for me.

25:39.950 --> 25:43.410
I assumed he was doing so legally.
That's most convenient.

25:43.410 --> 25:47.630
As for my experiments, I really
don't expect you to understand.

25:47.630 --> 25:50.070
I believe they're in the
area of developmental biology,

25:50.070 --> 25:53.690
the study of the embryo
and the growth of unborn organisms.

25:53.690 --> 25:55.610
Perhaps I have misjudged you.

25:55.610 --> 26:01.610
And I you. Imagine being able
to predetermine physical
characteristics in the womb -

26:01.610 --> 26:05.870
athletic ability, intelligence,
height, hair and eye colour,
even gender.

26:05.870 --> 26:09.610
In future, no sickly child need
be brought into this world again.

26:09.610 --> 26:12.290
You believe your
work here to be noble?

26:12.290 --> 26:13.970
It's more than noble.

26:13.970 --> 26:16.110
It's revolutionary.

26:16.110 --> 26:19.710
One day, it will ensure
the very future of mankind.

26:19.710 --> 26:23.250
Detective,
I've answered your questions.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.630
Will you please remove these?

26:25.630 --> 26:27.850
This is outrageous! You have nothing!

26:27.850 --> 26:31.870
I don't consider theft
and animal cruelty "nothing".

26:31.870 --> 26:34.210
What am I to do?
Chat with your neighbour.

26:34.210 --> 26:35.750
Perhaps about dogs.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.670
How'd them coppers
get my name, Doc?

26:38.670 --> 26:42.110
I don't suppose some mangy mutt
gave it to them, now, do I?

26:44.130 --> 26:46.510
MUSIC PLAYS

26:47.810 --> 26:52.870
Your taste in music has gotten
better, Jules. Less stuffy.

26:53.950 --> 26:56.110
Thank you. I think.

26:57.990 --> 27:00.050
You seem well.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.090
Very well.

27:03.170 --> 27:06.310
And Detective Murdoch?
The eternal courtship continues?

27:07.910 --> 27:11.290
Rather than discussing my affairs,
I think we should talk about yours.

27:11.290 --> 27:13.710
Mine? What of them?

27:13.710 --> 27:17.950
There's no easy way to say this, so
I'm just going to come out with it.

27:17.950 --> 27:22.270
I believe Mr Wells is
making advances towards me.

27:22.270 --> 27:23.950
That's just Bertie.

27:23.950 --> 27:27.710
Although his taste is
usually towards the less dowdy.

27:28.770 --> 27:32.070
Ruby, you do know the man is married?

27:32.070 --> 27:34.790
Of course!
And that means nothing to you?

27:34.790 --> 27:38.810
Quite the opposite. I think it
adds a certain frisson to it all.

27:38.810 --> 27:42.210
Oh, Jules, don't be so prudish.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.810
Prudish? I'm not being prudish.

27:43.810 --> 27:46.450
I'm concerned for your heart,
your wellbeing.

27:46.450 --> 27:49.790
For such a seemingly modern woman,
you can be decidedly old-fashioned.

27:49.790 --> 27:53.410
Ruby, you know this will end badly.

27:53.410 --> 27:58.570
I think it would be wise for you
to reconsider your relationship
with Mr Wells.

27:58.570 --> 28:02.430
Thank you for
the unsolicited advice.
I'll be sure to consider it(!)

28:04.490 --> 28:08.070
Dr Algar's right. You've got
nothing on him. Cruelty, theft?

28:08.070 --> 28:10.050
I'm not talking about minor charges.

28:10.050 --> 28:14.150
Look, I don't like the idea
of the bloke going round acting
like he's Dr Frankenstein either,

28:14.150 --> 28:16.430
but there's nothing tying him
to the murder of Linus Malling.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.590
And I'll admit there are
other nagging questions.

28:18.590 --> 28:22.510
Like why would he cut up the body
in a manner that'd
draw attention to himself?

28:22.510 --> 28:25.010
And why was the victim
beaten so brutally?

28:25.010 --> 28:27.790
The killer was filled with rage.

28:27.790 --> 28:31.410
Yet this Algar seems about
as dispassionate as they come.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.150
Do you have anything at all to go on?

28:33.150 --> 28:35.370
There is one thing.

28:35.370 --> 28:38.170
Dr Algar's experiments would
have been rather expensive.

28:38.170 --> 28:40.870
Someone must have been financing him.

28:40.870 --> 28:42.850
And I believe I know
who that individual was.

28:42.850 --> 28:46.090
Of course I funded Dr Algar's work!

28:46.090 --> 28:47.810
Why wouldn't I?

28:47.810 --> 28:52.650
Surely a man with a scientific bent
such as yourself must recognise the
significance of his experiments.

28:52.650 --> 28:57.290
I find them troubling. Troubling?
How? They're for the greater good!

28:57.290 --> 28:59.790
Where's the line
between human and animal?

28:59.790 --> 29:02.170
And what's to stop it
from being crossed?

29:02.170 --> 29:06.490
Ridiculous. No-one would ever
experiment on humans. To suggest
otherwise is scaremongering.

29:06.490 --> 29:09.810
Who's to say that line
hasn't already been crossed?

29:09.810 --> 29:11.710
By Algar?

29:11.710 --> 29:13.390
Or one of his associates.

29:16.550 --> 29:20.370
You are treading
dangerously close to slander.

29:20.370 --> 29:23.210
Please don't make me
report you to your superiors.

29:23.210 --> 29:27.110
If there is a connection between
you and Linus Malling's death,

29:27.110 --> 29:30.690
I will find it, Mr Pendrick.
On that you can count.

29:30.690 --> 29:34.010
Then I have no need to worry.

29:34.010 --> 29:37.670
Excuse me? Detective Crabtree?

29:37.670 --> 29:40.110
Oh, Miss Ogden!
Erm, I'm a constable.

29:40.110 --> 29:42.150
How forgetful of me.

29:42.150 --> 29:46.470
Er, Detective Murdoch's
not in right now. But if...
Actually, I'm here to see you.

29:46.470 --> 29:52.490
To see me? I need to speak
further with you for my article.

29:52.490 --> 29:56.650
Yes, well, I wouldn't want to impede
your writing. No, you wouldn't.

29:56.650 --> 30:00.130
Perhaps later?
Around six in the park?

30:00.130 --> 30:01.670
Yes, certainly.

30:03.910 --> 30:06.030
Miss Ogden, now isn't the time...
Detective.

30:09.870 --> 30:12.170
Actually, sir, she
wasn't here to see you.

30:12.170 --> 30:14.050
Oh!

30:14.050 --> 30:15.770
Oh, well, good.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.950
Er, and your book has arrived.

30:32.210 --> 30:34.990
Mr Wells! Please, please, come in.

30:34.990 --> 30:38.330
I hope I'm not catching you
at too inconvenient a time.

30:38.330 --> 30:40.610
No, not at all. Please, sit down.

30:40.610 --> 30:43.150
What is it that I may do for you?

30:43.150 --> 30:46.070
I am here on behalf of
the Eugenics Society.

30:47.690 --> 30:51.210
For what reason?
They want you as a member, of course.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.770
Me?

30:53.770 --> 30:57.210
I find that hard to believe.
I know what you're thinking, Murdoch.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.990
I had the very same thoughts.

30:58.990 --> 31:03.130
"I'm not worthy.
My stock isn't good enough."

31:03.130 --> 31:05.550
Sir, you know nothing of my stock.

31:05.550 --> 31:08.690
Oh, on the contrary,
I know a great deal about you.

31:08.690 --> 31:13.710
In fact, you were researched
by the Eugenics Society.

31:13.710 --> 31:18.310
Researched? Yes. You and I have very
similar backgrounds, it turns out.

31:18.310 --> 31:25.670
Both born into poverty, held deep
religious beliefs and scientifically
minded, both self-made men.

31:25.670 --> 31:29.390
Mr Wells... Detective,
I'm not asking for an answer.

31:29.390 --> 31:33.630
I'm merely a messenger.
Please consider the Eugenics Society.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.710
Mr Wells, if I may,

31:37.710 --> 31:40.050
you were trained in the
sciences by none other than

31:40.050 --> 31:43.170
Darwin's greatest advocate,
Thomas Huxley, were you not?

31:43.170 --> 31:44.710
I am proud to say yes.

31:44.710 --> 31:48.110
Then perhaps I can
trouble you to confirm that

31:48.110 --> 31:51.930
the specimen on that slide is in
fact the same as the reference?

31:51.930 --> 31:53.390
Of course.

32:02.610 --> 32:04.970
I concur.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.210
Let me guess.

32:13.210 --> 32:15.390
You're here to harass me again.

32:15.390 --> 32:17.710
I am here for the truth, sir.

32:17.710 --> 32:21.450
"The truth"? What the
devil are you talking about?

32:21.450 --> 32:25.130
A pollen sample was recovered
from Linus Malling's body.

32:25.130 --> 32:29.330
It is from the very rare
phantom orchid.

32:29.330 --> 32:33.630
Coincidentally, you have a
specimen right here in your home.

32:33.630 --> 32:38.510
Mr Pendrick, Linus Malling visited
you shortly before his death,

32:38.510 --> 32:41.390
something you failed to mention.
Would you care to explain why?

32:41.390 --> 32:44.890
I am growing tired of defending
my every move to you, Murdoch.

32:44.890 --> 32:46.670
So either arrest me...

32:46.670 --> 32:50.330
Constables, arrest Mr Pendrick.
This is an outrage, Murdoch.

32:50.330 --> 32:52.330
This is a bloody outrage.

32:58.306 --> 33:00.846
Linus called on me the morning
of the eugenics meeting.

33:00.846 --> 33:04.066
For what reason?

33:04.066 --> 33:07.946
To deliver his resignation
to the Eugenics Society.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.826
Resignation? Why?

33:12.126 --> 33:15.086
He felt the gulf between his
selectionist school of thought

33:15.086 --> 33:17.046
and my transformationist
beliefs was too great.

33:17.046 --> 33:20.766
I thought a middle ground
could be found. Linus disagreed.

33:20.766 --> 33:25.826
Mr Pendrick, one thing I am is
an excellent judge of character,

33:25.826 --> 33:27.766
and men of good character
never lie.

33:27.766 --> 33:31.586
However, they are from time
to time less than forthcoming.

33:33.946 --> 33:36.726
Linus was rejecting
the entire notion of eugenics.

33:36.726 --> 33:40.066
But I thought Mr Malling
was a devout believer.

33:41.646 --> 33:43.486
As did I.

33:43.486 --> 33:46.206
So why not simply
tell me this earlier?

33:46.206 --> 33:50.306
Linus left my house alive. I didn't
see how it affected matters.

33:50.306 --> 33:53.306
Again, you are showing less
than good character, sir.

33:53.306 --> 33:55.606
I have had just
about enough of this.

33:55.606 --> 34:01.406
You didn't want it known that a
prominent member of society rejected
your beliefs. That is absurd.

34:01.406 --> 34:05.466
Taken to its logical end, eugenics
will lead to forced sterilisation

34:05.466 --> 34:07.906
and the cruellest
experimentation imaginable.

34:09.466 --> 34:11.525
Detective Murdoch,

34:11.525 --> 34:15.226
the superior man
will be beyond such things.

34:18.126 --> 34:20.706
KNOCK AT DOOR

34:20.706 --> 34:23.466
That is my solicitor.

34:23.466 --> 34:25.866
I suggest you acquaint yourself.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.786
So, they call this Crackerjack?

34:31.786 --> 34:33.726
Yes.

34:33.726 --> 34:37.826
I tried it at the Chicago World's
Fair. It was rather clumpy then.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.226
Well, they seem to have
overcome the clumpiness.

34:40.226 --> 34:42.505
To delicious results, I might add.

34:44.126 --> 34:48.226
I had a look for your writings
on Houdini last year. Did you?

34:48.226 --> 34:51.505
I checked several of the newspapers
and magazines in the library,

34:51.505 --> 34:53.266
but I couldn't find them.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.126
You wouldn't have.

34:55.126 --> 34:59.726
Oh? I write under the nom
de plume Rupert Olssen.

34:59.726 --> 35:01.786
Why?

35:01.786 --> 35:03.986
It's just easier that way.

35:05.066 --> 35:08.066
To be a man?

35:08.066 --> 35:10.126
Yes.

35:10.126 --> 35:12.566
I find that very distressing.

35:12.566 --> 35:16.866
In fact, I find this whole eugenics
affair very distressing. Why?

35:16.866 --> 35:19.466
It would change the
whole world for the better.

35:19.466 --> 35:24.246
Well, I'm simply a man. I'm not
the tallest or the most handsome
or the smartest,

35:24.246 --> 35:28.946
but I consider myself
to be a good man of good character.

35:28.946 --> 35:31.606
I try to do well by others.

35:31.606 --> 35:35.586
I think with perseverance
I could achieve anything I wanted.

35:35.586 --> 35:42.986
And it seems to me that that
opinion would conflict with
the views of the eugenicists.

35:42.986 --> 35:44.846
And you.

35:44.846 --> 35:47.006
I mean, you are one, are you not?

35:47.006 --> 35:51.586
No. My relationship with Mr
Wells is strictly professional.

35:51.586 --> 35:55.086
That's not what I understood.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.986
The situation has changed recently.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.926
I should get back to work.

36:04.866 --> 36:06.346
Please.

36:12.206 --> 36:16.986
I think it's a shame that you
have to write under a man's name.
I think that's a real shame.

36:26.446 --> 36:28.426
CHATTERING

36:29.526 --> 36:32.246
That Pendrick has got a bloody
chilling streak in him.

36:32.246 --> 36:34.586
If you're not up to his standards,
you're no more than a dog to him.

36:34.586 --> 36:37.886
Oh, he's a man like any other,
as capable of murder as the next.

36:37.886 --> 36:41.066
However, I'm less
convinced of his guilt.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.666
You've changed your opinion.

36:42.666 --> 36:45.146
Not about the art thefts.

36:45.146 --> 36:49.106
But I question his involvement in
Mr Malling's murder. Based on...?

36:49.106 --> 36:50.846
For one thing, the manner of death.

36:50.846 --> 36:53.946
Why beat someone to death?
Usually, it's for a personal reason.

36:53.946 --> 36:57.346
Mm. Not some argument over
scientific principles. Agreed.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.906
It may have been embarrassing,
but hardly worth killing over.

36:59.906 --> 37:04.526
Maybe Malling's quitting the
Eugenics Society hurt someone else.

37:04.526 --> 37:06.666
And in a far more personal manner.

37:10.286 --> 37:12.086
Ah, George. Sir?

37:12.086 --> 37:16.246
I'd like us to revisit all of
Mr Malling's journals, logs,
business appointments, everything.

37:16.246 --> 37:17.786
I've been through them
several times.

37:17.786 --> 37:21.186
And I'm sure you did a thorough job.
But let's go over them again,

37:21.186 --> 37:24.566
this time not looking for a suspect.
What?

37:24.566 --> 37:27.626
I'm not sure.
Just anything out of the ordinary.

37:34.306 --> 37:37.686
Excuse me, Doctor. Mr Wells!

37:37.686 --> 37:41.886
I've come to see if you've
considered my dinner invitation.

37:41.886 --> 37:46.146
I have. And...?
And I'm afraid I must decline.

37:46.146 --> 37:48.046
I see.

37:48.046 --> 37:50.026
I confess my disappointment.

37:50.026 --> 37:52.186
Mr Wells, the answer is no.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.226
Of course.

37:54.226 --> 37:57.006
It's been a pleasure, Doctor.

37:57.006 --> 38:00.306
Perhaps we shall meet again.

38:00.306 --> 38:01.826
Perhaps.

38:05.026 --> 38:07.606
Mr Wells?

38:07.606 --> 38:11.886
Had I said yes, was I
simply to be another conquest?

38:11.886 --> 38:14.626
I'll answer with another question.

38:14.626 --> 38:19.906
Were you tempted?
Your silence speaks volumes.

38:19.906 --> 38:22.486
Does it?

38:22.486 --> 38:27.466
You see, Doctor, I sense that
there is something missing...

38:27.466 --> 38:29.366
in your life.

38:29.366 --> 38:34.026
At first I thought it was Murdoch, a
seemingly bland chap at first blush.

38:34.026 --> 38:35.786
He's far from bland!

38:35.786 --> 38:38.866
I've come to realise that.

38:38.866 --> 38:41.486
But there is something missing.

38:43.026 --> 38:44.626
I hope you can address it.

38:46.186 --> 38:48.106
Good day, Doctor.

39:04.146 --> 39:10.666
No disrespect intended, but if
I was as rich as Mr Malling, I'd
have led a more interesting life.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.246
Here's something.

39:12.246 --> 39:16.746
Four weeks ago, Mr Malling
made several trips to City Hall.

39:16.746 --> 39:19.066
Searching the records for something.

39:19.066 --> 39:21.506
I'd have thought a prominent
barrister would have an assistant

39:21.506 --> 39:23.346
to do that sort of thing. Indeed.

39:23.346 --> 39:26.066
Yet he chose to do so himself.

39:26.066 --> 39:28.266
I wonder what he was looking for.

39:52.946 --> 39:57.186
Mr Allan, I'll ask you again,
did you murder Linus Malling?

39:57.186 --> 40:00.086
This is a monstrous accusation
totally without foundation.

40:00.086 --> 40:03.466
Mr Malling had been checking
marriage records at City Hall,

40:03.466 --> 40:05.366
specifically those of your family.

40:05.366 --> 40:08.266
The intelligent work of any father
whose daughter is about to marry.

40:08.266 --> 40:10.846
The diligent work of a eugenicist

40:10.846 --> 40:13.626
checking his future
son-in-law's bloodlines, no?

40:13.626 --> 40:16.686
And what of it?
You failed to achieve his standards.

40:16.686 --> 40:18.906
Rubbish!
Your father died an incurable...

40:18.906 --> 40:22.846
Lies. Your brother was a convicted
thief. You won't defame my family.

40:22.846 --> 40:25.726
Your sister was caught...
There is no need to humiliate me!

40:25.726 --> 40:28.826
Mr Malling demanded you break
off the engagement, didn't he?

40:28.826 --> 40:30.546
I couldn't just give
up and let Estelle go.

40:30.546 --> 40:34.986
So I asked to meet with him
before the eugenics meeting to try
one last time to reason with him!

40:45.306 --> 40:47.786
The next thing I knew,
he was lying on the ground.

40:47.786 --> 40:50.466
You needed to dispose of the body.

40:52.606 --> 40:58.706
I had studied medicine at university,
so I finally put it to good use.

41:00.286 --> 41:02.846
And Dr Algar?
Did you mean to incriminate him?

41:02.846 --> 41:08.286
When suspicions fell on him, I let
matters take their natural course.

41:08.286 --> 41:12.866
The true shame is I believe Mr
Malling had had a change of heart.

41:12.866 --> 41:15.786
He had resigned his
position at the society.

41:15.786 --> 41:17.546
Why would Linus do that?

41:17.546 --> 41:22.926
I believe for Estelle.
He loved her more than anything
in this world, didn't he? He did.

41:22.926 --> 41:27.066
Her happiness superseded
any scientific argument.

41:27.066 --> 41:30.186
Pity he didn't get the
opportunity to tell you.

41:30.186 --> 41:33.006
It wouldn't have mattered, Detective.

41:35.226 --> 41:38.126
I am not fit
for a woman like Estelle.

41:38.126 --> 41:40.846
I'm not fit for any woman.

41:43.246 --> 41:45.546
Hang me.

41:45.546 --> 41:48.586
And put an end to my mongrel blood.

41:56.446 --> 41:59.906
Are you sure you must be off?
I do enjoy your visits.

41:59.906 --> 42:02.926
As do I. However, my next
writing assignment cannot wait.

42:02.926 --> 42:05.346
And what's it to be on? Eugenics.

42:05.346 --> 42:08.626
And the dangers associated with it.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.066
A very worthy subject.

42:11.066 --> 42:14.506
Actually, it'll be the first
piece published under my own name.

42:14.506 --> 42:17.986
Ruby, that's wonderful! Mm.

42:19.826 --> 42:22.026
And Mr Wells?

42:22.026 --> 42:28.706
While Bertie and I share
a special bond, I believe
it is time to move on. Oh!

42:28.706 --> 42:32.146
In fact, there might be
someone else in my future.

42:33.726 --> 42:37.006
Would you care to share?
After all, what are sisters for?

42:37.006 --> 42:40.426
Thank you, but not just yet.

42:42.026 --> 42:43.826
Constable Crabtree.

42:43.826 --> 42:45.666
Ah, Mr Wells.

42:46.706 --> 42:49.426
KNOCK AT DOOR

42:49.426 --> 42:52.546
Mr Wells! I came to say goodbye

42:52.546 --> 42:55.766
and congratulate you on your
investigation. Thank you.

42:55.766 --> 42:58.926
I hope this whole affair hasn't
coloured your opinion of eugenics.

42:58.926 --> 43:00.566
Not in the least.

43:00.566 --> 43:03.606
Eugenics is a matter we
will never see eye to eye on.

43:03.606 --> 43:07.706
That's most unfortunate.
But I respect your opinion.

43:07.706 --> 43:13.086
Goodbye, Detective. Oh,
might I borrow a pencil and paper?

43:13.086 --> 43:17.346
I must write these things down as
they come to me. This whole business

43:17.346 --> 43:20.866
with Dr Algar and the experimentation
on animals has given me an idea,

43:20.866 --> 43:22.866
something perhaps set...

43:22.866 --> 43:24.566
in a desert.

43:24.566 --> 43:28.206
Or perhaps something on the shores
of a remote island. Yes, an island.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.986
With a doctor. Of course, yes.

43:44.906 --> 43:46.626
Mrs Pendrick?

43:46.626 --> 43:49.326
Detective! What brings you here?

43:49.326 --> 43:51.146
To discuss eugenics?

43:51.146 --> 43:52.906
I'm afraid not.

43:52.906 --> 43:55.546
Oh. How disappointing.

43:55.546 --> 43:57.186
But perhaps for the better.

43:57.186 --> 44:01.566
Oh? Given these recent goings-on,
I've revised my opinions.

44:01.566 --> 44:05.026
I suspect your husband
won't take kindly to that.

44:05.026 --> 44:08.186
It has caused some tension.

44:08.186 --> 44:13.026
More than usual, that is. Your
husband is the reason for my visit.

44:13.026 --> 44:14.846
James?

44:14.846 --> 44:18.686
I find his views on eugenics
very disturbing.

44:18.686 --> 44:21.986
Further, given my suspicions
surrounding the recent art theft

44:21.986 --> 44:24.706
and subsequent murders...

44:24.706 --> 44:27.546
It causes me concern. For me?

44:29.106 --> 44:31.706
Surely you're joking, Detective.

44:31.706 --> 44:34.506
Should you have any reason,

44:34.506 --> 44:36.746
do not hesitate to contact me.

44:39.886 --> 44:42.386
Good day, Mrs Pendrick.

44:42.386 --> 44:44.066
Good day, Detective.
