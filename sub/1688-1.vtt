01:00.415 --> 01:03.665
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

01:03.752 --> 01:07.915
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

03:57.927 --> 03:58.508
Shit!

04:39.845 --> 04:43.296
- Tuna on white, no crust, right?
- I don't know. How is it?

04:43.974 --> 04:48.268
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

04:48.353 --> 04:52.102
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

04:52.190 --> 04:54.978
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

04:55.611 --> 04:57.520
- I'll have the tuna.
- No crust?

04:57.613 --> 04:58.692
No crust.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.044
Thank you.

06:11.103 --> 06:13.476
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

06:13.564 --> 06:16.186
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

06:16.609 --> 06:19.361
- That's why you're unloading in third.
- Told you.

06:19.445 --> 06:24.570
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

06:32.417 --> 06:35.038
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

06:35.128 --> 06:39.754
- No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
- Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

06:39.841 --> 06:43.340
- I know what he's slinging.
- He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

06:43.428 --> 06:45.670
- What's up, guys?
- How you doing, Mia?

06:45.763 --> 06:47.922
- How you living, girl?
- Hey!

06:48.516 --> 06:50.924
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

07:01.946 --> 07:05.066
- He's beautiful.
- I like his haircut.

07:07.786 --> 07:08.817
Vince!

07:10.080 --> 07:12.072
- What?
- Can I get you anything?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.114
You look good.

07:19.297 --> 07:21.967
- Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

07:24.886 --> 07:26.843
- Tomorrow?
- I love this part.

07:31.601 --> 07:36.228
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

07:36.314 --> 07:39.814
- I like the tuna here.
- Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

07:39.901 --> 07:41.312
Yeah, well, I do.

07:53.832 --> 07:57.367
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

07:57.461 --> 07:59.786
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

08:04.176 --> 08:06.667
- What did you put in that sandwich?
- That's funny.

08:06.762 --> 08:08.968
- Dom!
- All right.

08:27.491 --> 08:30.362
- Hey, man. He was in my face.
- I'm in your face.

08:31.996 --> 08:34.913
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

08:37.585 --> 08:38.865
Get over there!

08:40.379 --> 08:42.169
Jesse, give me the wallet.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.419
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

08:48.554 --> 08:50.345
- Is that what you are?
- No, man.

08:50.431 --> 08:52.388
Don't come around here again.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.719
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

08:57.772 --> 09:00.772
- You work for Harry, right?
- Yeah. I just started.

09:00.983 --> 09:02.525
You were just fired.

09:15.456 --> 09:18.576
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

09:19.085 --> 09:20.579
Dominic, I owe you.

09:22.505 --> 09:27.048
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

09:27.176 --> 09:31.803
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

09:32.348 --> 09:35.100
- What did Dominic say?
- You don't want to know.

09:35.435 --> 09:38.305
- What did Dominic say?
- He wants you out of here.

09:38.896 --> 09:40.854
- He wants me out of here?
- Yes.

09:40.940 --> 09:44.226
- And what did you say to Dom?
- What do you think I said?

09:44.527 --> 09:47.018
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

09:50.199 --> 09:51.231
Relax.

09:54.913 --> 09:56.158
I need NOS.

09:56.706 --> 09:58.912
- I need NOS.
- No.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.871
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

10:01.961 --> 10:06.374
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

10:07.175 --> 10:10.295
- You'll blow yourself to pieces.
- I need one of these.

10:10.553 --> 10:13.922
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

10:14.432 --> 10:16.591
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

11:28.382 --> 11:31.667
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

11:36.014 --> 11:38.850
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

11:41.603 --> 11:44.474
- Going to make me find out the hard way?
- Hell, yeah.

11:44.565 --> 11:47.435
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

11:48.068 --> 11:50.856
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

11:50.946 --> 11:53.402
- Brian Spilner.
- Typical white-boy name.

11:53.741 --> 11:55.614
Know what I'm saying?

11:57.912 --> 12:02.787
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.910
- Why not?
- I'm going legit, homey.

12:05.002 --> 12:07.671
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

12:07.755 --> 12:10.756
- Hell, yeah.
- So, what's up with you, man?

12:10.966 --> 12:15.130
- I'm just waiting for Toretto.
- Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

12:16.305 --> 12:18.796
- I'm standing next to it.
- That's funny.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.602
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

12:23.771 --> 12:25.977
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

12:26.399 --> 12:29.316
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

12:35.283 --> 12:38.200
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

12:53.593 --> 12:55.384
- Dom.
- Marvin.

12:57.096 --> 13:00.679
- Hey, Dom. How you doing?
- Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

13:05.063 --> 13:07.980
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.853
I smell skanks.

13:13.571 --> 13:17.439
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

13:17.534 --> 13:18.447
Okay.

13:18.701 --> 13:21.371
- Letty, I was just talking.
- Yeah. Whatever.

13:21.788 --> 13:24.789
- Okay, Hector.
- Yeah? What's up, man?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.043
- Yo. What's up?
- Edwin.

13:28.128 --> 13:30.500
- How we doing this tonight?
- One race.

13:31.005 --> 13:35.134
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

13:35.635 --> 13:38.636
- Why Hector?
- Too slow to make away with the money.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.768
- Okay. Good luck, guys.
- Hey, wait. Hold up.

13:44.269 --> 13:48.136
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

13:48.607 --> 13:52.439
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

13:52.652 --> 13:55.902
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

13:56.907 --> 14:00.026
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

14:00.452 --> 14:03.821
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

14:04.456 --> 14:05.487
Respect.

14:07.834 --> 14:10.206
To some people, that's more important.

14:12.339 --> 14:13.667
That your car?

14:17.469 --> 14:22.297
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T 4 turbo, Dominic.

14:22.474 --> 14:27.432
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

14:27.688 --> 14:30.475
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

14:31.483 --> 14:33.559
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

14:36.572 --> 14:38.030
You see that shit?

14:38.907 --> 14:42.193
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.287
- So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
- We don't know yet.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.790
But you're in. Let's go.

14:49.668 --> 14:51.210
- All right.
- Let's go!

15:55.651 --> 15:59.483
- What the hell is going on around here?
- Street's closed, pizza boy.

15:59.989 --> 16:02.907
- Find another way home.
- Goddamn street racers.

16:03.659 --> 16:07.953
<i>Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.</i>

16:54.127 --> 16:55.502
Edwin.

16:57.047 --> 17:00.001
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

17:00.884 --> 17:03.505
But if you win, you get her, too.

17:13.021 --> 17:14.563
You're going to win.

17:15.941 --> 17:17.518
I'm going to win.

18:01.904 --> 18:04.774
<i>We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.</i>

18:04.865 --> 18:09.242
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

18:09.954 --> 18:11.364
- All right.
- Let's race!

18:11.455 --> 18:12.486
Right.

18:22.258 --> 18:23.040
Go!

18:37.189 --> 18:38.304
Hell, yeah!

18:54.373 --> 18:55.998
Damn, that guy's fast.

19:04.175 --> 19:06.333
Let's go! Mčnage!

19:33.371 --> 19:36.158
No! Monica!

19:51.931 --> 19:53.390
Shut up!

20:48.113 --> 20:49.607
Well done, baby!

20:58.999 --> 21:00.908
Come on. Come on. Back up.

21:01.710 --> 21:05.044
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.001
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

21:09.426 --> 21:12.096
My sister holds the money. Count it.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.718
And you're my trophy.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.928
- Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
- What's your problem? You didn't win.

21:26.902 --> 21:28.183
Fuck you then!

21:41.500 --> 21:42.781
Was that fun?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.911
Got a problem there, buddy?

21:51.635 --> 21:54.886
- What are you smiling about?
- Dude. I almost had you.

21:57.725 --> 21:59.516
You almost had me?

22:00.186 --> 22:02.641
You never had me.
You never had your car.

22:05.942 --> 22:09.108
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

22:10.029 --> 22:14.193
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

22:15.451 --> 22:19.829
- Almost had me?
- You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

22:21.207 --> 22:24.291
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

22:24.377 --> 22:26.950
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.760
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

22:37.515 --> 22:41.976
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.598
Yeah!

22:49.194 --> 22:52.278
<i>All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne....</i>

22:52.363 --> 22:54.273
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

22:54.574 --> 22:55.819
Go!

23:07.545 --> 23:09.337
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

24:33.591 --> 24:35.797
<i>Toretto, stop right there!</i>

24:37.511 --> 24:38.626
<i>Toretto!</i>

24:53.652 --> 24:54.851
Get in!

25:41.367 --> 25:44.701
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

25:45.872 --> 25:49.786
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

25:50.043 --> 25:53.376
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

25:54.255 --> 25:57.256
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

25:57.342 --> 25:59.714
- No.
- You boost cars?

26:02.138 --> 26:04.297
- No. Never.
- Ever done time?

26:04.682 --> 26:07.008
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

26:07.769 --> 26:10.805
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

26:13.775 --> 26:15.269
Tucson, right?

26:15.985 --> 26:19.070
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

26:20.615 --> 26:23.782
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

26:24.494 --> 26:25.905
So, why bullshit?

26:27.622 --> 26:29.116
So, what about you?

26:31.585 --> 26:33.079
Two years in Lompoc.

26:36.131 --> 26:37.922
I'll die before I go back.

26:44.055 --> 26:46.048
- Oh, great.
- What?

26:48.977 --> 26:51.349
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

26:55.651 --> 26:57.026
Follow us.

27:47.745 --> 27:51.956
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

27:53.375 --> 27:55.000
Everybody stays happy.

27:55.127 --> 27:57.452
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

27:57.546 --> 28:00.464
- Who's "we"?
- My new mechanic.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.668
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

28:02.802 --> 28:05.803
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

28:05.888 --> 28:09.589
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

28:09.684 --> 28:12.091
- This your ride?
- It was. It's his now.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.011
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

28:17.191 --> 28:20.892
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

28:23.948 --> 28:27.566
- What do you think, Lance?
- It's an amazing machine.

28:28.244 --> 28:29.703
Yes, indeed.

28:31.914 --> 28:33.325
Let's go.

28:35.501 --> 28:39.914
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

28:40.173 --> 28:44.040
- You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
- I got something for you.

28:57.941 --> 29:01.475
- What the hell was that all about?
- Long story. I'll tell you later.

29:01.569 --> 29:03.194
Let's get out of here.

29:30.598 --> 29:31.713
NOS!

29:43.904 --> 29:47.320
- So, what the hell was that all about?
- It's a long story.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.109
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

29:51.119 --> 29:53.242
A business deal that went sour.

29:54.206 --> 29:57.290
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

30:23.485 --> 30:24.730
Take care.

30:29.825 --> 30:31.367
Yo, Spilner.

30:32.786 --> 30:34.993
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

30:35.664 --> 30:37.242
Oh, shit.

31:01.315 --> 31:04.269
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.815
- With all that nitrous.
- Yeah.

31:13.702 --> 31:17.154
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

31:23.087 --> 31:24.367
Where were you?

31:24.463 --> 31:28.710
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

31:28.801 --> 31:31.173
- This your beer?
- Yeah, that's my beer.

31:34.265 --> 31:36.756
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

31:37.435 --> 31:39.973
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

31:40.813 --> 31:43.684
- Can't even get that right.
- You all right?

31:45.860 --> 31:48.731
- Am I all right?
- It was just a question.

31:52.492 --> 31:53.772
Yo, Dom.

31:54.035 --> 31:58.115
- Why did you bring the buster here?
- 'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

31:58.373 --> 32:02.205
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

32:08.091 --> 32:11.839
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

32:12.512 --> 32:15.133
- Thanks, man.
- That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

32:17.141 --> 32:18.386
You.

32:25.525 --> 32:29.605
- Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
- Upstairs. First door on the right.

32:45.837 --> 32:49.253
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

32:49.341 --> 32:52.840
- He's right, Dom.
- There was a time when I didn't know you.

32:53.011 --> 32:54.920
That was in the third grade!

32:58.141 --> 33:01.641
- Yeah. So, what girls are here?
- You name it. You want mine?

33:01.728 --> 33:04.136
- You need to shut the....
- You want two?

33:04.356 --> 33:07.025
- You don't have anything?
- You look a bit tired.

33:07.109 --> 33:09.896
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

33:09.986 --> 33:13.355
- Look at all our guests.
- How about you give me a massage?

33:16.702 --> 33:18.160
Crazy lady.

33:25.836 --> 33:28.505
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

33:33.135 --> 33:34.415
Oh, shit.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.808
Did you wipe the seat?

33:45.063 --> 33:48.433
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

33:50.530 --> 33:55.758
- Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
- We were just about to get along.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.790
- So, what do you want?
- Anything, as long as it's cold.

34:07.419 --> 34:11.002
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.340
- He's a complicated guy.
- Yeah? What about you?

34:17.554 --> 34:19.880
- I'm simpler.
- You're a shitty liar.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.926
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

34:25.603 --> 34:28.274
- But there's a problem.
- What's that?

34:28.357 --> 34:30.563
You need to get some sleep.

34:31.152 --> 34:35.101
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

34:36.072 --> 34:38.362
Come on. I'll take you home.

35:00.181 --> 35:03.098
<i>Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.</i>

35:03.601 --> 35:06.721
<i>Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.</i>

35:07.271 --> 35:10.854
<i>Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.</i>

35:11.067 --> 35:14.436
<i>Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.</i>

35:17.490 --> 35:21.440
- What did I do?
- Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.539
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

35:34.632 --> 35:37.550
- Shit. You put them on so tight.
- I like realism.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.503
You never know who's watching, Brian.

35:44.809 --> 35:48.593
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.900
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.985
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

35:59.741 --> 36:03.075
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.486
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.787
- You told him what happened?
- He knows.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.789
- Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
- The kid's giving me attitude?

36:11.878 --> 36:14.630
It doesn't speak well
for police/FBI relations, Tanner.

36:14.714 --> 36:18.333
- I walk in the door and the guy's already--
- All right, all right.

36:18.427 --> 36:20.633
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

36:20.721 --> 36:24.006
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

36:24.099 --> 36:26.424
- Come on.
- Regular or decaf, Sarge?

36:28.020 --> 36:29.430
Decaf, I think.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.476
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.650
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

36:35.736 --> 36:38.523
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

36:38.614 --> 36:41.449
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.027
That's why you're undercover.

36:44.119 --> 36:48.069
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

36:48.415 --> 36:51.250
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.251
What does the truckdriver say?

36:54.338 --> 36:57.873
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

36:57.966 --> 37:00.920
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

37:01.011 --> 37:05.472
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.262
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

37:08.352 --> 37:12.813
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.606
I tell them we're close.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.727
Are you going to make me a liar?

37:17.820 --> 37:19.362
Look, what do we know?

37:19.446 --> 37:21.937
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

37:22.032 --> 37:25.117
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

37:25.202 --> 37:29.532
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win--

37:29.623 --> 37:33.573
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.455
Just get me something I can use.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.960
Is Harry cooperating?

37:41.052 --> 37:44.634
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

37:44.722 --> 37:46.845
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

37:46.932 --> 37:50.052
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

37:50.144 --> 37:52.516
- He's too controlled for that.
- Wait.

37:52.605 --> 37:55.725
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

37:55.816 --> 37:59.351
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

37:59.445 --> 38:02.565
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.566
Do not turn your back on him.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.535
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.490
- What about parts and service?
- Hold off on it.

38:14.585 --> 38:16.911
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

38:20.008 --> 38:23.840
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

38:25.596 --> 38:28.004
- This is your car.
- My car?

38:28.641 --> 38:31.595
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

38:31.686 --> 38:35.518
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

38:36.816 --> 38:39.734
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.685
No faith.

38:41.779 --> 38:44.187
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

38:44.282 --> 38:46.524
- This is a garage.
- Pop the hood.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.071
- Pop the hood?
- Pop the hood.

38:51.206 --> 38:54.871
- 2JZ engine. No shit.
- And what did I tell you?

38:54.959 --> 38:57.711
- I retract my previous statement.
- You know what?

38:57.796 --> 39:02.374
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

39:02.467 --> 39:06.216
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.384
- We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
- Yes!

39:09.808 --> 39:13.592
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

39:14.145 --> 39:16.850
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

39:16.940 --> 39:19.229
That's where you'll do it.

39:19.609 --> 39:22.943
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

39:23.196 --> 39:26.945
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

39:28.285 --> 39:29.530
...you don't belong near a car.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.498
He owns you now.

40:01.819 --> 40:03.610
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

40:04.446 --> 40:06.653
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

40:06.865 --> 40:10.199
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

40:10.285 --> 40:11.530
All right?

40:12.371 --> 40:14.447
This is your basic layout of the car.

40:14.540 --> 40:18.372
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

40:19.128 --> 40:20.503
Red, green.

40:21.130 --> 40:24.665
- You should be going to MIT or something.
- Yeah, right.

40:25.342 --> 40:28.177
No, I got that.... What's it called?

40:29.263 --> 40:31.421
That attention disorder--

40:31.515 --> 40:35.216
- ADD?
- Yes, that shit. Yeah.

40:36.353 --> 40:40.268
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

40:41.108 --> 40:44.857
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

40:45.738 --> 40:48.858
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

40:48.949 --> 40:52.069
...that calms me down, you know.

41:12.932 --> 41:15.388
- I'm outta here.
- Come on, dog.

41:16.018 --> 41:18.688
- Yo, Dom.
- Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

41:18.771 --> 41:21.689
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

41:35.371 --> 41:38.491
- Mia! The chicken's dry.
- All right. I'm coming out already.

41:43.838 --> 41:45.332
Here you go.

41:47.258 --> 41:48.669
Hey, hold up.

41:49.177 --> 41:54.420
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

42:00.438 --> 42:03.143
- Dear heavenly....
- Spirit.

42:04.818 --> 42:06.478
Spirit. Thank you.

42:07.028 --> 42:12.236
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

42:13.201 --> 42:17.033
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

42:17.205 --> 42:19.696
...and titanium valve springs.

42:20.458 --> 42:22.083
- Thank you.
- Amen.

42:23.211 --> 42:25.168
- Not bad.
- Amen.

42:25.255 --> 42:27.497
He was praying to the car gods, man.

42:28.842 --> 42:30.384
He's not the best.

42:30.468 --> 42:32.627
- What do you want?
- Practice.

42:32.721 --> 42:34.049
Thank you, girl.

42:34.139 --> 42:37.722
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

42:37.809 --> 42:40.561
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

42:40.729 --> 42:43.683
- You know, I gotta eat.
- He's always hungry.

42:43.774 --> 42:45.813
All right, sit down.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.109
How you doing, Mia?

42:58.288 --> 42:59.913
Here you go.

43:06.380 --> 43:09.131
- Jesse, hand me that chicken.
- Let's eat some grub, man.

43:09.216 --> 43:12.336
- Want some of that chicken?
- What, you rent a movie or something?

43:19.435 --> 43:21.344
Need a hand with anything else?

43:21.437 --> 43:24.888
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

43:25.399 --> 43:29.064
- The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
- I'd like to go there.

43:34.241 --> 43:38.453
- I think we should go out sometime.
- No, I don't date my brother's friends.

43:39.163 --> 43:40.657
That sucks.

43:40.748 --> 43:44.081
- I'll have to kick his ass then.
- I'd love to see that one.

43:44.168 --> 43:47.453
I would pay to see that one, actually.

44:01.394 --> 44:03.102
Wash my car when you get done.

44:03.187 --> 44:06.852
- What was that?
- No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

44:07.692 --> 44:10.147
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

44:10.236 --> 44:13.521
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

44:16.826 --> 44:20.526
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

44:21.789 --> 44:25.787
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

44:25.960 --> 44:27.953
The one with the picadillo and--

44:28.045 --> 44:31.829
- With red candles, wooden tables--
- The plantain, food all over the place.

44:31.924 --> 44:33.798
- What it's called?
- Cha Cha Cha.

44:33.885 --> 44:35.842
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

44:37.013 --> 44:39.005
Well, you can take me there.

44:39.140 --> 44:41.761
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

44:42.393 --> 44:44.433
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- Good.

44:50.860 --> 44:54.774
- There's no popcorn.
- Make your own goddamn popcorn!

45:08.795 --> 45:11.368
All right. Now that's valet parking.

45:15.301 --> 45:17.590
- Harry. What's up, dog?
- Nice to see you.

45:17.679 --> 45:19.506
Excellent. Come on in, man.

45:19.597 --> 45:22.717
- Check it. It's yours.
- Damn. What do we got here?

45:23.852 --> 45:26.343
- Hired some new help?
- Don't even think about it.

45:26.438 --> 45:28.893
- What's up?
- What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

45:28.982 --> 45:31.899
- Pretty good. What do you need?
- What's up, man?

45:31.985 --> 45:35.520
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

45:37.157 --> 45:39.114
Why don't you look that over?

45:39.409 --> 45:42.576
- When do you need this stuff by?
- Tomorrow, today, now.

45:42.996 --> 45:45.238
- Right.
- White boys work fast, don't they?

45:48.502 --> 45:49.830
That's right.

45:52.714 --> 45:56.214
- You said you need three of each?
- Yeah, three of everything.

45:57.010 --> 45:59.680
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

48:07.809 --> 48:09.351
He moans like a cop.

48:18.653 --> 48:22.817
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

48:23.575 --> 48:25.567
Nod if you understand me.

48:25.660 --> 48:26.941
Nod!

48:28.788 --> 48:30.199
Sit up.

48:36.463 --> 48:39.132
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

48:39.424 --> 48:41.880
Shit. What I'm doing?

48:44.471 --> 48:45.846
Dom.

48:48.099 --> 48:50.804
I owe you a 10-second car.

48:51.770 --> 48:55.388
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

48:58.568 --> 49:02.436
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

49:02.906 --> 49:05.444
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

49:05.575 --> 49:08.411
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

49:08.495 --> 49:12.742
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

49:14.376 --> 49:16.452
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

49:19.965 --> 49:21.673
So, what are you saying?

49:22.885 --> 49:27.428
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

49:30.309 --> 49:31.767
Yeah.

49:34.605 --> 49:38.519
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

49:40.527 --> 49:41.903
He's a cop.

49:44.239 --> 49:45.354
He's a cop!

49:48.661 --> 49:49.989
You a cop?

49:56.502 --> 49:58.329
Let's go for a little ride.

50:01.340 --> 50:02.715
Walk!

50:22.111 --> 50:23.819
Okay. You stand watch.

50:54.560 --> 50:56.220
Yo, Dominic.

50:57.980 --> 50:59.640
There's no engines.

51:00.775 --> 51:03.527
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

51:03.611 --> 51:06.019
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

51:06.114 --> 51:08.949
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

51:14.122 --> 51:15.071
What?

51:24.215 --> 51:25.544
We got a wolf pack.

51:26.050 --> 51:29.716
<i>It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.</i>

51:30.180 --> 51:32.801
All right, we got company. Spilner.

51:58.792 --> 52:01.081
Come on. Move!

52:01.336 --> 52:03.376
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

52:04.881 --> 52:08.085
- Do you see anything wrong here?
- No.

52:11.972 --> 52:14.379
- We got no engines, do we?
- No.

52:14.474 --> 52:15.755
- Do we?
- No.

52:18.854 --> 52:21.427
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

52:21.523 --> 52:24.559
- ... one week before Race Wars, huh?
- Yeah, probably.

52:24.943 --> 52:27.944
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

52:29.448 --> 52:31.357
What are you feeling, Lance?

52:32.868 --> 52:34.410
40-weight?

52:34.912 --> 52:36.738
50-weight?

52:37.372 --> 52:39.080
A 40-weight sounds nice.

52:54.682 --> 52:56.224
Where are they, Ted?

52:56.392 --> 52:58.218
- Where are they?
- Enough!

52:58.394 --> 53:00.885
- Where are they?
- They're in a warehouse.

53:01.438 --> 53:03.348
They're in a warehouse, man!

53:19.623 --> 53:20.904
Ted.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.660
Kiss my shoes?

53:34.930 --> 53:36.804
Let's go get our engines.

53:37.683 --> 53:40.470
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

53:40.561 --> 53:42.186
I want something to show.

53:42.271 --> 53:44.762
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

53:44.857 --> 53:48.475
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

53:48.569 --> 53:51.903
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

53:51.989 --> 53:55.358
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

53:55.451 --> 53:57.195
Because all we have is behavior.

53:57.286 --> 54:00.371
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just--

54:00.456 --> 54:02.449
What we have is probable cause.

54:02.542 --> 54:06.409
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

54:06.504 --> 54:10.584
- Tell us about Hector, Brian.
- Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

54:10.842 --> 54:14.424
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

54:14.512 --> 54:16.303
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

54:16.389 --> 54:18.512
- Get him a cigarette.
- Don't give him one.

54:18.766 --> 54:21.222
- I thought you quit.
- I did. Just give me one.

54:21.311 --> 54:23.054
- Get him a cigarette.
- No!

54:25.356 --> 54:26.981
Tell me about Toretto.

54:27.233 --> 54:30.020
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

54:30.111 --> 54:34.738
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

54:35.116 --> 54:38.781
- I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
- What did you say?

54:38.870 --> 54:42.453
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

54:45.251 --> 54:46.496
Knock it off!

54:47.670 --> 54:50.208
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

54:54.886 --> 54:57.128
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

54:57.389 --> 54:59.714
- Yeah. I memorized that file.
- Read it again.

54:59.808 --> 55:02.215
No, better still, take a look at these.

55:04.020 --> 55:07.389
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

55:07.816 --> 55:11.101
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

55:11.611 --> 55:13.568
He's a model of self-control.

55:16.491 --> 55:18.199
I need a few more days.

55:20.954 --> 55:22.152
I need a few more days.

55:25.083 --> 55:26.661
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

55:28.045 --> 55:31.912
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

55:32.090 --> 55:34.581
- I got this set up for 24 psi.
- Got it.

55:38.096 --> 55:39.888
You got big plans tonight?

55:42.017 --> 55:44.175
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

55:45.771 --> 55:48.344
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

55:48.982 --> 55:50.477
That's not gonna happen.

55:55.656 --> 55:57.483
I want to show you something.

56:11.755 --> 56:13.463
Me and my dad built her.

56:14.341 --> 56:16.713
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

56:18.012 --> 56:19.257
It's a beast.

56:19.847 --> 56:22.717
- You know what she ran in Palmdale?
- No. What?

56:22.892 --> 56:24.350
Nine seconds flat.

56:25.853 --> 56:27.976
- God.
- My dad was driving.

56:28.522 --> 56:32.734
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

56:33.819 --> 56:35.776
Barely kept her on the track.

56:36.530 --> 56:39.448
- So, what's your best time?
- I've never driven her.

56:39.533 --> 56:40.613
Why not?

56:43.371 --> 56:45.328
It scares the shit out of me.

56:47.750 --> 56:48.995
That's my dad.

56:50.503 --> 56:53.208
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

56:53.631 --> 56:55.339
Last race of the season.

56:56.467 --> 57:00.679
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

57:01.514 --> 57:05.013
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

57:08.187 --> 57:10.559
I watched my dad burn to death.

57:13.109 --> 57:15.185
I remembered hearing him scream.

57:18.364 --> 57:22.907
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

57:29.292 --> 57:31.664
They said it was me who was screaming.

57:35.214 --> 57:37.622
I saw Linder about a week later.

57:39.010 --> 57:42.426
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

57:42.764 --> 57:47.473
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

57:52.857 --> 57:55.146
He's a janitor at a high school.

57:56.277 --> 57:58.815
He has to take the bus to work every day.

58:00.031 --> 58:02.736
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

58:08.373 --> 58:10.864
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

58:12.711 --> 58:15.498
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

58:15.589 --> 58:18.080
...not my team and all their bullshit.

58:19.801 --> 58:22.173
For those 10 seconds or less...

58:23.680 --> 58:25.340
...I'm free.

58:45.827 --> 58:49.078
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

58:49.331 --> 58:50.446
- What?
- The gang.

58:50.540 --> 58:52.948
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

58:53.043 --> 58:55.368
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

58:55.462 --> 58:59.460
- They call themselves a team.
- All right. How did the team come to be?

58:59.925 --> 59:02.214
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

59:03.637 --> 59:07.338
- I've got time.
- Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

59:08.308 --> 59:11.428
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.513
But they were friends as kids.

59:13.731 --> 59:16.304
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

59:16.483 --> 59:19.733
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

59:19.820 --> 59:23.403
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

59:24.074 --> 59:27.739
- And then she turned 16--
- And then she had Dom's attention.

59:28.037 --> 59:30.954
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

59:31.707 --> 59:32.952
Yeah.

59:36.253 --> 59:38.744
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

59:38.881 --> 59:43.839
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

59:44.678 --> 59:47.964
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like....

59:49.517 --> 59:51.474
He's like gravity.

59:52.603 --> 59:54.809
Everything just gets pulled to him.

59:56.440 --> 59:57.816
Even you.

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.403
No.

01:00:01.529 --> 01:00:02.904
No.

01:00:03.364 --> 01:00:06.199
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

01:00:06.284 --> 01:00:09.119
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

01:00:11.873 --> 01:00:13.415
That's good.

01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:18.786
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

01:00:22.425 --> 01:00:23.456
Want to go for a drive?

01:01:02.173 --> 01:01:04.415
- Yeah?
<i>- The hijackers have hit again.</i>

01:01:04.509 --> 01:01:09.586
<i>Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.</i>

01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:11.555
<i>Unless you say otherwise.</i>

01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:13.515
<i>If you agree, just say yes.</i>

01:01:14.144 --> 01:01:16.136
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:20.141
It's just a wrong number.

01:04:12.365 --> 01:04:14.524
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but--

01:04:14.743 --> 01:04:17.412
Yeah. Yes, sir.

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.031
Yeah. I got it.

01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:25.457
The DVD players were purchased legally.

01:04:25.545 --> 01:04:28.795
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:31.171
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

01:04:31.259 --> 01:04:32.919
- So, they're out.
- Yeah.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.714
Father bailed them out.

01:04:35.847 --> 01:04:39.596
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

01:04:44.439 --> 01:04:47.606
- You're gonna put this on me?
- I can put it on whoever I want to.

01:04:47.692 --> 01:04:50.397
- Perks of the job.
- No, you can't put this on me--

01:04:50.487 --> 01:04:52.361
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:56.659
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

01:04:56.743 --> 01:04:59.281
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:02.455
...or you might want to think
about another career.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.926
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

01:05:18.307 --> 01:05:20.180
Tran and Hector are....

01:05:20.601 --> 01:05:22.392
They're just fumes.

01:05:25.647 --> 01:05:28.352
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

01:05:28.442 --> 01:05:32.107
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.733
He won't go back to prison.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.572
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

01:05:44.667 --> 01:05:47.074
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

01:05:48.504 --> 01:05:51.291
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:11.309
You ready for this?

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.555
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

01:06:41.182 --> 01:06:43.755
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:51.435
Smoke him.

01:07:46.373 --> 01:07:48.164
So, what's wrong, Brian?

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:50.833
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

01:07:51.294 --> 01:07:54.544
Come on. Obviously something's off.

01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.790
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

01:07:59.469 --> 01:08:03.052
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

01:08:05.016 --> 01:08:07.852
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

01:08:08.019 --> 01:08:09.478
I got the shrimp.

01:08:09.896 --> 01:08:12.470
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:16.231
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

01:08:17.154 --> 01:08:19.526
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

01:08:19.615 --> 01:08:21.572
What do you mean, like me?

01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:24.737
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

01:08:24.828 --> 01:08:27.533
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try--

01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:29.740
I'm not stupid, all right?

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:34.205
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood--

01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:37.665
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

01:08:37.758 --> 01:08:40.510
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

01:08:41.345 --> 01:08:44.345
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

01:09:07.203 --> 01:09:09.279
- Well, what is this?
- Read it.

01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:12.371
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

01:09:14.377 --> 01:09:16.086
To Race Wars.

01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:18.380
We'll see how you go.

01:09:19.383 --> 01:09:21.008
Then we'll talk.

01:10:07.306 --> 01:10:08.931
- How's it going?
- What's up?

01:10:09.017 --> 01:10:11.686
- Welcome to Race Wars.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

01:10:35.085 --> 01:10:36.792
Baby. Hey, baby.

01:10:37.962 --> 01:10:39.789
You should watch from the side.

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:42.337
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

01:10:42.425 --> 01:10:46.505
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

01:10:46.596 --> 01:10:49.052
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.225
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:55.311
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

01:10:57.983 --> 01:10:59.393
You got it.

01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:21.460
"Another one bites the dust"

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.669
Come on. What you got?

01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:28.846
See ya.

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:07.796
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up, Jesse?

01:12:08.262 --> 01:12:09.542
What's in your hand?

01:12:09.638 --> 01:12:12.010
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:14.720
- The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
- Yeah.

01:12:15.144 --> 01:12:17.682
- You can't bet your dad's car.
- It's all right.

01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:19.052
I ain't losing.

01:12:19.148 --> 01:12:22.647
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

01:12:22.818 --> 01:12:27.361
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:31.066
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:40.666
You visualize the win.

01:12:40.753 --> 01:12:44.418
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

01:12:44.507 --> 01:12:46.049
Who are you racing?

01:12:50.429 --> 01:12:52.636
Jesse, don't do it.

01:12:52.765 --> 01:12:56.430
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

01:13:19.584 --> 01:13:21.161
Too soon, junior.

01:13:24.797 --> 01:13:25.663
No!

01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.000
Shit!

01:13:30.637 --> 01:13:31.799
Oh, God!

01:13:42.232 --> 01:13:44.901
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:46.728
- What?
- Jesse.

01:13:48.238 --> 01:13:50.277
Where's Jesse going?

01:13:50.448 --> 01:13:53.948
- He just raced Tran for slips.
- Oh, shit.

01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:08.750
- Where's he going?
- He went to the car wash.

01:14:08.967 --> 01:14:10.924
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:13.136
Go fetch your car?

01:14:14.097 --> 01:14:15.757
We're not on your block.

01:14:15.849 --> 01:14:18.470
You better watch who you talk to like that.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:20.133
Toretto!

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.314
SWAT came into my house...

01:14:26.276 --> 01:14:30.523
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

01:14:31.239 --> 01:14:33.695
And you know what? It was you!

01:14:58.058 --> 01:15:00.098
Get off of him, man.

01:15:09.445 --> 01:15:11.236
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

01:15:11.322 --> 01:15:13.113
I never narked on nobody!

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.731
I never narked on nobody!

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:55.820
Mia.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.952
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.784
Now I am asking you not to go.

01:16:04.876 --> 01:16:07.746
- I'm doing this for both of us.
- Don't give me that crap.

01:16:07.837 --> 01:16:09.296
You're doing this for you.

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:13.508
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.971
- Mia, what's going on?
- What?

01:16:28.066 --> 01:16:30.557
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.902
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:35.572
What's the matter with you?

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:38.230
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

01:16:38.326 --> 01:16:41.493
- You know about the trucks?
- No, Brian! What trucks?

01:16:41.579 --> 01:16:45.447
- Jesus Christ. What?
- Listen to me.

01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:48.168
Mia, I'm a cop.

01:16:49.712 --> 01:16:52.382
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

01:16:52.465 --> 01:16:55.917
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

01:16:57.178 --> 01:16:58.376
I'm a cop.

01:17:03.435 --> 01:17:05.059
Oh, you bastard.

01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:09.178
You bastard.

01:17:11.568 --> 01:17:13.395
- Mia.
- Get off of me, Brian!

01:17:13.486 --> 01:17:15.230
Mia! Listen to me!

01:17:16.489 --> 01:17:19.063
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

01:17:19.159 --> 01:17:21.780
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:25.488
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

01:17:25.582 --> 01:17:29.033
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

01:17:29.127 --> 01:17:32.876
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

01:17:32.964 --> 01:17:34.672
...is coming down on them.

01:17:34.758 --> 01:17:37.675
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

01:17:37.761 --> 01:17:40.845
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.724
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:49.853
Please, Mia. Please help me.

01:18:01.785 --> 01:18:04.620
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

01:18:04.705 --> 01:18:07.990
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:11.037
- So, what does that leave us with?
- All this.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:22.841
<i>- Nextel.</i>
- This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

01:18:23.015 --> 01:18:27.392
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.639
<i>- Okay. What's the cell number?</i>
- Mia, what is it?

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.941
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:43.990
323-555-6439.

01:18:45.079 --> 01:18:47.652
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

01:19:13.858 --> 01:19:17.690
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:23.323
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

01:19:23.451 --> 01:19:27.579
- Don't do that.
- Something's wrong.

01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:30.499
- Stop.
- We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

01:19:31.626 --> 01:19:34.580
This is the mother Iode.
We've been on this for three months.

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:37.162
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:39.214
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

01:19:42.762 --> 01:19:45.846
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.054
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

01:19:49.435 --> 01:19:51.475
- Really?
- Really.

01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:56.807
Come on. Let's make this happen.

01:19:59.904 --> 01:20:04.400
- Leon, keep on those scanners.
- Copy that.

01:20:07.954 --> 01:20:09.994
All right, let's go.

01:20:20.592 --> 01:20:23.676
<i>Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.</i>

01:20:23.762 --> 01:20:28.258
<i>Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.</i>

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.011
Let me see this.

01:20:34.814 --> 01:20:37.056
I think we're about 40 miles away.

01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.108
What are you gonna do?

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:42.396
What are you gonna do?

01:21:14.688 --> 01:21:16.764
Okay! Go time!

01:21:32.456 --> 01:21:34.912
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.281
Keep going.

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.012
Vince!

01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:54.761
Vince, don't! Get back in!

01:21:56.355 --> 01:21:57.470
Vince!

01:22:03.112 --> 01:22:04.820
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

01:22:04.905 --> 01:22:07.194
Back off! Get him off of there!

01:22:09.869 --> 01:22:11.149
Oh, shit!

01:22:22.214 --> 01:22:24.884
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:29.344
Unhook yourself. Do it!

01:22:29.722 --> 01:22:31.715
- Do it!
- I can't get--

01:22:31.808 --> 01:22:33.183
You can do it!

01:22:34.227 --> 01:22:35.685
Come on, Vince!

01:22:43.194 --> 01:22:45.767
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

01:22:53.246 --> 01:22:54.705
Come on, boy!

01:22:55.915 --> 01:22:58.038
Shot doesn't get better than this.

01:23:03.089 --> 01:23:04.370
Son of a bitch!

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:11.546
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

01:23:11.639 --> 01:23:15.886
Try it again. One, two, three!

01:23:27.906 --> 01:23:29.483
Unhook yourself!

01:23:31.242 --> 01:23:33.116
I can't get my arm free!

01:23:33.203 --> 01:23:35.445
- Vince, grab my hand!
- My arm!

01:23:35.538 --> 01:23:37.330
Listen, give me your hand.

01:23:37.499 --> 01:23:39.954
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

01:23:43.129 --> 01:23:44.754
Vince!

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.832
Hold on!

01:23:46.925 --> 01:23:49.048
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

01:23:55.892 --> 01:23:56.888
Dominic!

01:23:56.977 --> 01:23:58.175
Shit!

01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:03.855
- Dominic!
- Hang on!

01:24:04.443 --> 01:24:07.360
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

01:24:32.471 --> 01:24:33.799
Letty!

01:24:34.598 --> 01:24:35.629
Leon!

01:24:35.724 --> 01:24:36.803
Pull back for Letty.

01:24:36.892 --> 01:24:38.172
<i>Get her out of there!</i>

01:24:38.268 --> 01:24:39.679
I'm on it! Go!

01:24:48.862 --> 01:24:51.532
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

01:24:56.871 --> 01:24:59.112
Letty! Come on, baby.

01:25:00.165 --> 01:25:01.245
You okay?

01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:03.741
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

01:25:03.836 --> 01:25:07.419
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

01:25:21.228 --> 01:25:22.723
Vince!

01:25:51.008 --> 01:25:52.171
Take the wheel.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:54.965
- What do you mean?
- Put your foot on the gas!

01:25:55.722 --> 01:25:58.010
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

01:25:58.099 --> 01:25:59.344
Okay!

01:26:02.729 --> 01:26:05.813
- Come on. Keep it steady.
- I got it!

01:26:07.358 --> 01:26:09.315
All right, hold on, Vince.

01:26:10.111 --> 01:26:13.029
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:14.395
All right.

01:26:15.241 --> 01:26:17.400
- Closer.
- I'm moving in.

01:26:17.785 --> 01:26:19.363
Hold it right there!

01:26:20.205 --> 01:26:21.284
Go!

01:26:23.458 --> 01:26:26.031
You got to hang in here with me now!

01:26:26.127 --> 01:26:28.286
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

01:26:28.379 --> 01:26:30.538
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

01:26:34.511 --> 01:26:37.084
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

01:26:37.889 --> 01:26:40.214
Vince, don't let go!

01:26:44.437 --> 01:26:46.513
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:53.778
Mia, get closer! Come on.

01:26:53.864 --> 01:26:55.737
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:25.091
Shit.

01:27:28.732 --> 01:27:32.267
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

01:27:35.531 --> 01:27:37.155
- Watch her.
- I got her.

01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:40.613
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:47.957
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

01:27:48.043 --> 01:27:50.499
- Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
- I got it.

01:27:56.427 --> 01:27:59.381
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

01:27:59.596 --> 01:28:02.052
I'm off-duty MAPD.

01:28:02.182 --> 01:28:04.970
I need a life flight roll out right away.

01:28:06.103 --> 01:28:10.397
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

01:28:10.941 --> 01:28:13.978
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:16.643
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

01:28:16.822 --> 01:28:20.571
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

01:28:20.659 --> 01:28:25.037
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

01:28:26.957 --> 01:28:28.867
Yeah, he's going into shock!

01:30:08.935 --> 01:30:10.845
Dom, put the gun down now!

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.267
- Move your car.
- No bullshit!

01:30:15.358 --> 01:30:17.814
Put it down now! No more running!

01:30:17.944 --> 01:30:19.487
I'm not running!

01:30:22.616 --> 01:30:25.023
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone!

01:30:25.118 --> 01:30:28.155
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

01:30:28.246 --> 01:30:31.164
- Put the gun down. I swear to God!
- You are the cop!

01:30:31.249 --> 01:30:32.660
You're a cop!

01:30:34.253 --> 01:30:37.622
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

01:30:37.714 --> 01:30:40.585
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

01:30:40.676 --> 01:30:44.376
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

01:30:44.555 --> 01:30:48.006
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.849
Mia, stay out of it!

01:30:55.399 --> 01:30:58.602
Dominic, I am so sorry.

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.192
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.527
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

01:31:05.617 --> 01:31:08.369
What were you thinking, man?

01:31:08.454 --> 01:31:10.945
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.949
I'm scared!

01:31:13.042 --> 01:31:16.126
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

01:31:20.674 --> 01:31:22.169
Dom!

01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:42.357
Jesse!

01:31:42.446 --> 01:31:43.941
No, Jesse!

01:31:58.671 --> 01:32:00.296
No, Dom, no!

01:34:55.182 --> 01:34:58.551
Call 911. You call 911!

01:35:33.388 --> 01:35:36.139
I used to drag here back in high school.

01:35:36.849 --> 01:35:41.013
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

01:35:42.188 --> 01:35:44.810
On green, I'm going for it.

01:38:19.388 --> 01:38:21.630
That's not what I had in mind.

01:39:08.188 --> 01:39:10.097
You know what you're doing?

01:39:10.565 --> 01:39:12.641
I owe you a 10-second car.
