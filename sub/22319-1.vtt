00:34.602 --> 00:35.434
- Hey!

00:35.436 --> 00:36.435
- What the hell?

00:39.473 --> 00:40.372
- Stop!

00:46.246 --> 00:50.816
Please,
somebody's tryin' to kill me.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.820
- What in heaven's name
are you talkin' about?

00:54.822 --> 00:58.123
- They're all, they're all dead.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.625
- Who's dead?

02:23.309 --> 02:27.146
- Help me!

02:27.148 --> 02:29.281
I don't wanna die.

02:37.657 --> 02:38.891
- Where am I?

02:38.893 --> 02:41.193
- I'm Dr. onochectomy.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.429
It appears you've
been in an accident.

02:47.168 --> 02:47.166
A man found you on
the side of the road

02:47.168 --> 02:51.370
and you were fortunate enough
that he brought you in.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.572
The police are on their way,

02:53.574 --> 02:57.709
but why don't you tell
me what you remember.

03:02.783 --> 03:07.186
- We were goin' on a trip
and there were four of us.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.224
- And how did you
guys end up here?

03:12.226 --> 03:12.925
- We...

03:17.597 --> 03:18.497
We, uh...

03:40.687 --> 03:42.487
- Okay, so where
are we going again?

03:42.489 --> 03:43.555
- It's a surprise.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.957
- It's hardly a surprise.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.993
It's a dirty old cabin.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.428
- Seriously.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.563
- It fuckin' sucks.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.699
- It's not that bad.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.666
- I just don't
understand why we have to

03:54.668 --> 03:56.735
go so freakin' far out of town.

03:56.737 --> 03:56.735
- I mean, it is called camping.

03:56.737 --> 04:00.539
- Oh, that's enough time for
you to give your boyfriend

04:00.541 --> 04:02.241
some good road head.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.977
- And I bet you'd
wanna watch, too.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.278
Perv.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.053
- Come on, loser.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.489
- Seriously, five minutes.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.726
- Oh, I have to pee so bad.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.528
Where's the bathroom?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.729
- I don't know.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.897
Hello?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.465
Is anybody here?

05:14.380 --> 05:15.580
Hello?

05:30.597 --> 05:32.431
- What are you doing?

06:12.405 --> 06:14.039
- Who in the hell are you?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.140
- You just scared
the shit out of me.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.109
- What are you doin' back here?

06:17.111 --> 06:18.810
- Man, I was just
lookin' for the bathroom.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.079
- Did you see the sign out
there said we're closed?

06:21.081 --> 06:24.483
You're not supposed to go
through other people's things!

06:24.485 --> 06:26.551
See, they're my tapes!

06:35.862 --> 06:37.829
Bathroom's in the back.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.575
Where y'all from?

06:50.577 --> 06:52.043
- Nashville.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.845
- Nashville?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.148
- Yeah, we're down
here for fall break.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.449
Goin' on a campin' trip.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.083
- Campin' trip?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.518
Where y'all headed?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.853
- It's Kentucky, some
place in goreville.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.656
- You're in Kentucky, stupid.

07:04.658 --> 07:04.656
- Huh.

07:06.826 --> 07:10.495
- I've never heard of goreville.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.032
I live, I was born and
raised here in lowes.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.869
- I'd hate to live here.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.538
Not much around here
to do, is there?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.206
- Not unless you don't
mind killin' somethin'

07:21.208 --> 07:23.208
every once in a while.

07:23.210 --> 07:26.978
Haven't you ever
been huntin' before?

07:26.980 --> 07:27.879
- Oh.

07:27.881 --> 07:32.684
- Every once
in a while we get pricks

07:32.686 --> 07:36.188
like you that don't mind
your own durn business.

07:36.190 --> 07:40.058
I'm just kidding.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.131
You lookin' for somethin' to do?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.703
Check that out.

08:07.553 --> 08:09.521
- All right, I'm ready.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.823
- So, what is it supposed to be?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.992
Some type of theme
park or somethin'?

08:13.994 --> 08:17.262
- What is taking so long?

08:17.264 --> 08:17.262
- Let's go check this out.

08:17.264 --> 08:17.262
They got one of those
haunted house things

08:17.264 --> 08:20.232
you put up for Halloween.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.199
- So?

08:21.201 --> 08:21.199
- We gotta go check it out.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.502
- There's now way Lindsay's
gonna go for that.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.669
- Fuck her.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.504
Quit bein' such a little pussy.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.072
Come on, let's go.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.547
- What is taking so long?

08:35.549 --> 08:39.851
- Okay, so apparently there's
this haunted house, right?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.219
Like, for Halloween?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.587
- And?

08:42.589 --> 08:45.624
- I thought we
could check it out.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.658
- Talon falls.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.628
Let me guess, Lance's idea?

08:49.630 --> 08:50.996
- It could be fun.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.064
- No.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.599
- Seriously?

08:54.601 --> 08:58.169
These things aren't
even that scary.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.938
I bet it's cheesy.

08:59.940 --> 09:00.872
- Okay.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.806
Well, if it's cheesy and stupid,

09:01.808 --> 09:03.642
then we don't have to go.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.711
Great, I'm glad we
got that settled.

09:16.789 --> 09:19.124
- So what's the plan, dude?

09:22.662 --> 09:25.664
- It's only a couple of miles.

10:39.705 --> 10:43.908
- They're here.

10:56.088 --> 10:57.389
- All right.

10:57.391 --> 10:59.057
- Have fun.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.859
- Are you seriously just
gonna stay in the car?

11:00.861 --> 11:01.760
- Yeah.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.129
- See ya.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.831
- I'll be fine.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.732
- Okay.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.008
- If you get bored I guess
you can come find us.

11:17.010 --> 11:17.909
- I won't.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.095
- I guess she's
stayin' in the car.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.830
- Who cares?

12:58.544 --> 13:00.812
- Oh, wish I had my jacket.

13:03.048 --> 13:04.048
- Hey.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.517
You okay?

13:05.519 --> 13:09.287
- Yeah, I just got a little bit
creeped out bein' by myself.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.289
- Well, you can hang out
here with us if you want.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.824
- Yeah, that's fine.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.292
But hey, I brought your jacket.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.527
- Oh thanks.

13:15.529 --> 13:16.494
So, bad news.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.896
- What?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.063
- It's gonna be at least
a couple more hours

13:19.065 --> 13:20.532
that we have to stand in line.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.801
- Are you seriously
gonna wait that long?

13:22.803 --> 13:23.868
- Hell yeah.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.873
- I don't know, dude.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.108
- God, really?

13:30.910 --> 13:33.211
- Hey guys, how y'all doin'?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.813
- Great.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.548
- She always this
sarcastic?

13:36.550 --> 13:38.183
- No, she's a fuckin' bitch.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.855
- It's just cold and the
lines are really long.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.857
- Well, y'all come out on
one of our busiest nights.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.225
- Do you have any idea
how long it's gonna take?

13:47.227 --> 13:50.328
- Probably about three hours.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.497
Y'all guys aren't from
around here, are ya?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.299
- No, we're actually
on a road trip.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.468
We just thought we'd stop
and check this place out.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.538
- Tell ya what, I'm not
supposed to do this,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.307
but since it's your
first time here,

14:02.309 --> 14:03.942
you got a little ways to go,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.877
I've got four speed
passes you guys can have,

14:05.879 --> 14:07.846
take y'all to the
front of the line.

14:07.848 --> 14:08.613
- That's awesome.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.081
- Okay, man.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.883
Dude, what we gotta do?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.919
- Well, just hold
out your right arms.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.258
All right guys, just march
up to the front of the line,

14:20.260 --> 14:21.960
show the gatekeeper your wrist,

14:21.962 --> 14:25.096
and remember, don't tell
anybody I gave you those.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.030
- Hey, thanks, dude.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.065
We really appreciate this.

14:27.067 --> 14:27.932
- No problem.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.267
Y'all have fun.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.392
- Let me outta here!

16:34.394 --> 16:35.226
Let me outta here!

16:35.228 --> 16:36.494
Let me out.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.762
Come on,
let me outta here.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.730
Stop!

16:38.732 --> 16:40.098
Let me out!

16:48.208 --> 16:51.109
- Shit.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.527
- Holy shit.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.166
- No!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.069
- Come on guys, let's just go.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.405
- No, no, please don't.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.040
No!

17:27.746 --> 17:32.183
- Look at his fuckin'
ass.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.124
Die, motherfucker!

17:41.393 --> 17:43.728
- All right, man, let's go.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.307
- Woo!

18:06.618 --> 18:07.518
- Lance.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.503
- I got dibs.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.271
Come on, let's go.

18:54.700 --> 18:55.733
- Shit, it's stuck.
- It's stuck.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.201
- Nice.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.870
- What about that one?

19:00.306 --> 19:01.172
- Nope.

19:04.209 --> 19:04.909
- Well.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.650
At least they can see us.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.920
- See, I told ya
somebody was watchin' us.

19:15.922 --> 19:16.821
- Hello?

19:31.303 --> 19:32.203
- Help me!

19:34.540 --> 19:35.439
Please!

19:36.909 --> 19:39.410
Help!

19:39.412 --> 19:40.311
Please!

19:42.181 --> 19:45.383
Please, help me.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.284
Please!

19:47.753 --> 19:48.920
Help!

19:52.225 --> 19:55.693
Please help me.

19:57.262 --> 19:57.962
Help!

20:01.600 --> 20:03.734
What do you want from me?

20:04.770 --> 20:05.836
Please help!

20:09.908 --> 20:12.310
Get away from me!

20:12.312 --> 20:12.310
Please!

20:13.912 --> 20:17.982
Please don't do this.

20:24.489 --> 20:27.391
Help me.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.231
- Thank god.

20:33.233 --> 20:33.931
- Bye.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.261
Lance, what?

21:07.032 --> 21:09.400
- This is where
these fuckers stay at.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.635
- Nice.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.303
And creepy.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.838
Can we go now?

21:13.840 --> 21:18.276
Lance, we're probably not
supposed to be back here.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.433
- Where'd they go?

21:43.802 --> 21:46.070
- I don't know.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.939
They're probably
just screwing around.

21:48.941 --> 21:49.840
Come on.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.377
It'll be fine, come on.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.550
- Get off me, fucker.

21:59.552 --> 22:00.818
This is stupid.

22:01.753 --> 22:02.787
Lance.
- Come here.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.588
- What are you doing?

22:06.391 --> 22:07.892
Are you crazy?

22:07.894 --> 22:10.628
Someone could find us back here.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.361
Did you hear that?

22:44.863 --> 22:45.896
It sounded like
someone was coming.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.131
- It's just the fuckin' people.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.432
- Shh.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.714
I think I just saw something.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.082
- Oh my god.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.517
All right, you stay here.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.685
I'll go look.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.968
- Lance!

23:36.516 --> 23:39.683
- This girl, was gonna take her
down to the river, you know?

23:39.685 --> 23:41.419
So, they leave and
get down there--

23:41.421 --> 23:42.620
- Lance!

23:48.828 --> 23:49.894
- Yeah?

23:51.831 --> 23:54.665
They need us back
out front, men.

25:53.652 --> 25:55.886
- Ah!

25:55.888 --> 25:58.622
- Can't see a damn thing.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.897
- Do you have your phone?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.299
- Yeah, take it.

26:12.571 --> 26:13.837
- Did you hear that?

28:05.417 --> 28:06.917
- Sure you're okay?

28:22.834 --> 28:24.735
- Put me down, motherfucker!

28:24.737 --> 28:26.370
Let me go!

28:26.372 --> 28:27.237
No!

28:27.239 --> 28:28.739
Let me go!

28:28.741 --> 28:30.274
No!

28:30.276 --> 28:31.842
Let me outta here!

28:34.813 --> 28:35.713
No!

28:35.715 --> 28:37.214
Let me outta here!

28:37.216 --> 28:38.449
No!

28:38.451 --> 28:40.150
No, you guys, don't
leave me here!

28:40.152 --> 28:41.051
No!

28:42.120 --> 28:43.854
Let me out of here!

28:45.291 --> 28:46.490
Lindsay?

28:46.492 --> 28:48.058
Oh my god, Lindsay,
you're bleeding.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.493
- Where's Lance?

28:49.495 --> 28:49.493
- I don't know.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.996
Lance wanted to check out
some hidden door or something.

28:52.998 --> 28:57.234
Next thing I knew some guy
in a mask was chasing me.

28:58.136 --> 28:59.470
Who's this guy?

29:00.905 --> 29:02.806
- So, what happened to you?

29:02.808 --> 29:04.775
- The same thing as
you guys, I guess.

29:04.777 --> 29:05.976
I just woke up in here.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.011
- Well, they can't keep us here.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.147
- I don't think you guys
understand the gravity

29:10.149 --> 29:11.782
of the situation we're in.

29:11.784 --> 29:15.085
- Whatever, this is
fuckin' kidnapping.

29:16.221 --> 29:18.188
- What are you doing?

29:18.190 --> 29:21.158
- I'm trying to
get this door open.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.432
But that's not your problem.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.774
Those dogs are trained to attack

29:36.776 --> 29:38.342
anybody that tries to escape.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.378
They're vicious.

29:59.531 --> 30:00.430
- No.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.500
Help me.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.838
Please help me, please.

30:07.840 --> 30:08.872
No.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.074
No.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.075
Please, no.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.078
No.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.079
Please, no.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.415
What are you doing?

30:18.417 --> 30:22.152
Somebody help me.

30:27.927 --> 30:28.826
Please.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.937
Please god.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.471
Please.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.006
No, I don't wanna die.

30:43.008 --> 30:43.907
No! No!

30:44.909 --> 30:47.444
No!

30:51.583 --> 30:52.850
No! Help me!

30:55.120 --> 30:56.954
I don't wanna die.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.155
No!
- Let her go!

31:00.425 --> 31:02.993
- Please, I don't wanna die!

31:08.000 --> 31:10.267
- Let her go!

32:24.943 --> 32:27.077
- So, what are they
gonna do to her?

32:27.079 --> 32:29.079
- Isn't it obvious?

32:29.081 --> 32:32.049
Who'd you think all those
people were out there?

32:32.051 --> 32:33.550
- Wait, are you
trying to tell me

32:33.552 --> 32:37.554
that all the people that
we've seen have been real?

32:37.556 --> 32:38.989
- But why would they do that?

32:38.991 --> 32:40.157
They could get caught.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.625
- You didn't think it was real.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.993
- It was disgusting.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.262
- Yeah, but what's the point?

32:46.397 --> 32:47.998
- Look around.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.300
There's cameras everywhere.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.105
- So?

33:02.213 --> 33:03.280
- Oh my god.

33:04.749 --> 33:07.084
They're filming this.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.353
- But why would anybody wanna
watch something like that?

33:09.355 --> 33:10.554
- Probably some fucked up perv

33:10.556 --> 33:13.023
still living in
his mom's basement.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.324
- All I know is
I'm not waitin' around here

33:14.326 --> 33:15.559
to find that shit out.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.128
- Well, what are you gonna do?

33:18.130 --> 33:20.230
- Look, I'm pretty sure

33:20.232 --> 33:22.399
I can break outta
here fairly easily,

33:22.401 --> 33:23.433
but I'm gonna need some help.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.417
- What are you doing?

34:13.418 --> 34:16.319
- I wanna get the
fuck outta here.

34:18.589 --> 34:21.058
So, you said you had a plan.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.092
So, what's up?

34:23.194 --> 34:26.063
- I need somebody
to distract the dog.

34:26.065 --> 34:26.797
- How?

34:26.799 --> 34:29.733
- Is there any bread back there?

34:36.541 --> 34:38.708
- Okay, now what?

34:38.710 --> 34:42.079
- This is what we're gonna do.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.097
- No, please.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.466
Please don't.

35:03.568 --> 35:06.570
Stop.

35:07.371 --> 35:08.505
What is that?

35:09.340 --> 35:10.407
Please stop.

35:11.476 --> 35:14.377
Please.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.481
Please stop.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.882
What are you doing?

35:18.884 --> 35:20.183
Please!

35:25.457 --> 35:26.356
Oh please!

35:27.325 --> 35:28.225
Stop!

35:46.612 --> 35:47.444
- Get in there!

35:47.446 --> 35:48.745
You get in that cage!

35:48.747 --> 35:49.913
- Shut up!
- Get in there!

35:54.720 --> 35:56.853
- Please
get me outta here.

35:56.855 --> 36:00.157
Please.

36:00.159 --> 36:00.824
Please.

36:31.722 --> 36:32.889
- I'm dead.

36:32.891 --> 36:33.790
Now what?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.761
Can't we make this
go any faster?

36:37.763 --> 36:39.196
- There's no time.

36:39.198 --> 36:39.963
They're comin'.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.364
- Lindsay.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.269
- What am I supposed to do?

36:48.272 --> 36:48.972
- No!

36:48.974 --> 36:50.574
Leave him alone!

36:51.876 --> 36:53.510
No!

36:53.512 --> 36:54.477
Sean!

36:56.748 --> 36:58.415
No, leave him alone!

36:58.417 --> 37:00.584
- Stay the fuck
away from me, dude.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.487
Help me, please.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.325
Stay the
fuck away from me.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.426
- No, leave him alone!

37:10.963 --> 37:12.796
Stop!

37:16.334 --> 37:17.234
Sean!

37:22.306 --> 37:23.406
No!

37:28.613 --> 37:29.980
No.
- Get away from him!

37:29.982 --> 37:31.615
Let him go!

39:23.894 --> 39:24.794
- Look...

39:28.899 --> 39:30.600
The only way you guys are
ever gonna see him again

39:30.602 --> 39:33.370
is if we actually
get outta here.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.572
- Will you just shut
up for one second?

39:35.574 --> 39:36.873
- Well, we can't just sit here.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.608
- She just lost her boyfriend.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.043
- No, Ryder, he's right.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.778
- If we're gonna try to
escape, we've gotta do it now.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.113
- And how are we gonna do that?

39:43.115 --> 39:44.714
- Ryder, please.

40:59.590 --> 41:00.457
- Help!

41:23.848 --> 41:26.249
- All right, go ahead.

42:34.184 --> 42:37.320
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

42:51.268 --> 42:52.168
Hey, help.

42:53.237 --> 42:54.137
Help me!

43:05.116 --> 43:06.015
Help me!

43:07.685 --> 43:08.585
Please!

44:45.883 --> 44:47.283
Help me, please!

44:48.085 --> 44:49.686
Please, help me.

44:50.422 --> 44:54.190
No, no, no, no.

46:16.808 --> 46:20.276
- Shiny, go
check the holding room.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.573
- Hurry, please.

47:37.888 --> 47:39.989
Please hurry, Lindsay.

47:42.492 --> 47:44.026
Hurry, Lindsay.

47:46.263 --> 47:47.163
Hurry.

48:03.047 --> 48:03.980
- Come on!

51:07.665 --> 51:08.564
- What?

51:16.406 --> 51:17.807
Oh my god, someone's coming.

51:17.809 --> 51:20.409
Oh my god, someone's coming.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.153
- Hello?

51:31.155 --> 51:32.254
Yeah.

51:33.323 --> 51:34.223
Uh-huh.

51:42.132 --> 51:42.832
All right.

51:49.706 --> 51:50.739
All right.

52:08.125 --> 52:08.824
- Help me!

52:09.860 --> 52:10.759

52:19.236 --> 52:20.136
Help me!

53:32.642 --> 53:34.243
- Help!

53:34.245 --> 53:35.277
- Oh my god.
- Somebody!

53:35.279 --> 53:37.413
- He's eating him.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.348
- What the hell?

53:39.350 --> 53:39.982
- Let us out.
- The dog just

53:39.984 --> 53:41.850
fucking ate him, man!

53:41.852 --> 53:42.685
Killed him.

53:42.687 --> 53:43.619
- What the hell?

53:43.621 --> 53:44.653
- Please let us out!

53:44.655 --> 53:46.288
- Shut up!
- It fucking killed him!

53:47.858 --> 53:48.991
- Where are the girls?

53:48.993 --> 53:52.328
- Help,.

53:52.330 --> 53:57.466
- Go get everybody together
and go get the girls now.

53:57.468 --> 53:59.835
Get outta here, you son of
a bitch, and go get 'em!

53:59.837 --> 54:01.270
- Please let us go.

54:01.272 --> 54:02.538
- Please.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.773
- Please let us go.

55:18.081 --> 55:19.515
- What are we gonna do?

55:19.517 --> 55:20.849
- I don't know.

55:25.622 --> 55:27.690
- You go that way.

57:05.488 --> 57:06.588
- Lindsay!

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.043
- Help me.

01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:00.816
- Lance?

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:02.451
Oh my god, Lance.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:03.351
- Help me.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.921
- I thought you were dead.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.256
What have they done to you?

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:11.827
- Where's Sean?

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:12.894
- He's dead.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.034
- It's hot.

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.488
- Hey! Stop!

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.423
Stop!

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.193
Hey!

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:52.894
Hey! Stop!

01:08:54.196 --> 01:08:54.863
Hey!

01:08:54.865 --> 01:08:56.163
Stop!

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.372
Please, somebody's
tryin' to kill me.

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:07.475
- What in heaven's name
are you talkin' about?

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.344
- They're all, they're all dead.

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.678
- Who's dead?

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:17.285
- I ran out in the
middle of the road

01:09:17.287 --> 01:09:19.754
and tried to get him to stop,

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.158
but that's all I remember.

01:09:24.292 --> 01:09:27.662
- You know,
you're lucky to be alive.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.265
It's a good thing Mr.
Levi was driving by.

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:33.434
- Well, where is he?

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.203
- I think he's
around here somewhere.

01:09:36.206 --> 01:09:38.573
Let me go see if can find him.

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:56.291
- Doctor?

01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:00.562
- Did you know that son of
a bitch broke my window?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.829
You better pay me or
else I'll stick his head

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:05.433
up his ass and make a
jug handle outta him.

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:13.274
How you feelin', little lady?

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:16.477
- I'm a little better.

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:20.682
- Can you believe this little
thing almost got away from us?

01:10:20.684 --> 01:10:23.251
It's a good thing I found her.

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.354
Well, I best be goin'.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:30.225
Oh shit, I bet they're
lettin' people through.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:32.427
I got cars to tow, you know.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:34.529
