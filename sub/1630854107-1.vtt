WEBVTT

00:08.509 --> 00:10.311
McGEE:
Is that your former partner?
Yep.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.479
DNA matched the tissue

00:11.579 --> 00:14.248
Jimmy found on the body.
Parker?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.383
Deputy Director,
are you accusing

00:15.483 --> 00:16.750
one of my agents
of murder?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.552
Given Agent Parker's
history with the victim,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.454
he should be on the list
of suspects.

00:20.554 --> 00:24.258
Cute couple there.
You don't think they're, uh...

00:24.358 --> 00:26.360
Nah.
Definitely not, no.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.998
DUCKY:
The Raven went to great lengths
to poison half the city.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.234
And now it appears he blames you

00:33.334 --> 00:34.835
for stopping the attack.

00:34.935 --> 00:35.969
Blames me for something.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.138
Killing my ex-partner

00:37.238 --> 00:38.472
and framing me for the murder.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.074
The Department of Justice
said you agreed

00:40.174 --> 00:41.375
to hand over Agent Parker.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.776
An extra go bag
with a change of clothes

00:42.876 --> 00:44.745
in case the FBI has
your apartment staked out.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.549
Everybody, this is my
ex-wife Vivian.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.617
You sure you want to do this?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.119
This Raven came after me, too.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.021
Whatever bigger plans he has,
I'm already a part of it.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.437
We're sure Parker's in there?

01:09.537 --> 01:11.405
Both Parker and Kolchak, sir.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.840
Dressed for stealth and sitting

01:12.940 --> 01:14.375
in one of the booths
on the left.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.510
Based on one anonymous tip?
More than one.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.612
We had multiple calls
reporting a male and female

01:18.712 --> 01:20.614
matching our BOLO descriptions.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.684
Amazing.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.854
We spend two days scouring
the entire eastern seaboard,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.456
only to find them slumming
in plain sight

01:28.556 --> 01:29.590
at his local diner.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.360
What do you call that,
Agents? Huh?

01:32.460 --> 01:37.030
Is Parker crazy?
Ballsy? Stupid?

01:37.131 --> 01:38.966
Or a genius.

01:39.066 --> 01:41.435
Or a genius.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.205
RAMIREZ:
So, we going in?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.607
This one's all mine.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.076
You two cover the exits.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.447
(bell jingles)

01:55.416 --> 01:56.884
Of all the gin joints

01:56.984 --> 01:58.886
in all the towns
in all the world.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.054
Hey, Sweeney.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.427
Diner is a long way
from Casablanca.

02:06.527 --> 02:10.431
Yeah, and you'd make
a terrible Bogart.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.233
What you've done here is called
aiding and abetting a fugitive.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.700
Not to mention
actively interfering

02:46.800 --> 02:48.101
with an investigation.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.271
All right, all right.
Tap the brakes, Sweeney.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.874
Seriously, no one here is
aiding and abetting anyone.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.644
If anything, you're interfering
with our investigation.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.579
What are you talking about?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.248
KNIGHT: You just blew
our cover, Sweeney.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.515
We're here on a case
of our own.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.517
Well, at least we were.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.585
So you sitting there

03:04.685 --> 03:06.920
has nothing to do
with Parker?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.290
Our convergence here is just
an amazing coincidence.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.559
Well, so much for Rule 39.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.764
But since we are all here,
and you're mentioning Parker...

03:16.864 --> 03:18.599
KNIGHT: Can we at least
talk about the fact

03:18.699 --> 03:20.668
that we all know that
he's being set up?

03:20.768 --> 03:23.437
By whom, exactly?
This Raven character?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.838
Give me a break.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.107
Look, I admit it's
a pretty lame nickname,

03:27.207 --> 03:30.978
but whoever's behind it
did try to poison half of D.C.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.381
Not to mention nearly killing
two of our own.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.482
Which would make him
far too busy

03:34.582 --> 03:36.450
to waste time framing Parker.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.386
McGEE: But if Raven
is framing Parker,

03:38.486 --> 03:39.753
can't we just take a breath,

03:39.853 --> 03:41.589
take some time to consider
his motives?

03:41.689 --> 03:42.890
(bell jingles)
Oh, is that what this is about?

03:42.990 --> 03:44.825
Some shameless appeal
to buy more time?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.160
VANCE:
So where are they?

03:47.261 --> 03:50.864
Leon. Tell me you're not part of
this little charade, too.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.566
Don't insult me, Wayne.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.568
Our tip line
apparently just received

03:54.668 --> 03:55.969
the same anonymous phone calls

03:56.069 --> 03:59.407
about Parker and Kolchak
that you did.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.874
How the hell can that be?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.643
The calls must've come
from a third party.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.812
Like the Raven?

04:04.912 --> 04:07.014
Which only proves that
we need more time.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.181
Enough!

04:08.282 --> 04:10.884
You take all the time
you need, Agents.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.086
You may be blinded
by loyalty,

04:13.186 --> 04:15.155
but as far as the FBI
is concerned,

04:15.255 --> 04:18.559
Parker's time is up.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.798
(bell jingles)

04:26.700 --> 04:31.572
So our tip line didn't
really get a call?

04:31.672 --> 04:34.274
This is a very dangerous game
that you're playing,

04:34.375 --> 04:36.610
and that's the last time
I'm going to bend the truth

04:36.710 --> 04:37.978
to save your asses.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.947
Director, we can explain.
Save it.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.583
Now, I appreciate you wanting to
help Parker as much as I do,

04:42.683 --> 04:45.786
but deliberately poking
the FBI hornet's nest

04:45.886 --> 04:47.154
is no way to do it.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.822
Well, it's crazy to think
that Sweeney might

04:48.922 --> 04:50.023
actually listen to reason.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.825
Or that he would
give us more time.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.060
So what about Parker?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.928
Do we in fact know
where he is right now?

04:55.028 --> 04:57.097
No, sir, he's been
sticking to the game plan.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.132
Not a word since he
and Vivian drove off

04:59.232 --> 05:01.034
with Kasie's list
of accounting firms.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
Trying to figure out
who put his name

05:03.236 --> 05:04.405
on the offshore account.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.474
And you don't have any idea
how to reach him?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.642
Uh, don't answer.
I don't want to know.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.278
But in case any one of you
do hear from him,

05:11.379 --> 05:13.681
tell him to hurry.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.785
(bell jingles)

05:20.488 --> 05:21.489
(exhales sharply)

05:21.589 --> 05:23.491
So much for good intentions.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.258
McGee.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.960
I'm on it.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.331
All right, thanks, McGee.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.666
Well, that didn't sound good.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.101
To put it mildly.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.003
They tried to buy us
some time with Sweeney,

05:36.103 --> 05:38.672
but they just ended up
pissing him off.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.875
You're a lucky man, Park.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.012
Really? That's your takeaway?

05:45.112 --> 05:47.047
Yeah. That's a
credit to you,

05:47.147 --> 05:49.049
endearing yourself
to a new team

05:49.149 --> 05:51.351
that's willing to stick their
necks out for you like this.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.320
Well, that's not on me.
That's just them.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.256
They're a special group.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.426
And you are lucky
to have them.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.060
Okay, fine, I'm lucky.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.063
Not to mention grateful
to have people around me

06:03.163 --> 06:04.965
that I can trust.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.536
(computer chimes)
Yeah.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.837
Finally.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.873
Please tell me we have a winner.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.444
(sighs)
I wish I could.

06:16.544 --> 06:20.180
But there is no link between
this bogus offshore account

06:20.280 --> 06:23.116
in your name
and a Prudhomme Financial Group.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.452
I need a shower.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.719
Well, look on the bright side.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.955
That's two firms
off of Kasie's list

06:28.055 --> 06:29.923
that we've been able
to eliminate in two days.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.959
With only nine firms to go.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.562
We will get there.
(chime)

06:34.662 --> 06:35.963
What was that?

06:36.063 --> 06:39.232
Oh, shoot, that's your laptop
reminding me

06:39.332 --> 06:40.701
to update your firewall.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.770
And I need you on that wall.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.705
Save me some hot water,
Colonel.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.039
No promises.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.241
I may need to soak
my head for a while.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.313
(water running)

07:22.743 --> 07:24.044
What do we do
when we hit a wall?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.178
We go back to square one.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.547
Well, we didn't hit a wall.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
We kind of just scraped it.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.819
Well, either way, let's put
yesterday's bad idea behind us

07:31.919 --> 07:33.821
and start reviewing
every little thing

07:33.921 --> 07:35.656
we've got on Raven
from the first day

07:35.756 --> 07:37.157
he reared his ugly
little head.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.992
Well, not for nothing,
but Jimmy and I have been

07:39.092 --> 07:41.495
doing just that
for the past two days.
Just that?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.797
Searching for anything
that we may have missed.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.599
Mm-hmm. That's all
you've been doing?

07:45.699 --> 07:46.934
Yeah. I mean, I wish I could say

07:47.034 --> 07:48.636
that we found
something new, but...

07:49.703 --> 07:52.239
Really?
McGEE: Okay, guys?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.875
I think that maybe
we are too focused

07:54.975 --> 07:56.243
on who the Raven is

07:56.343 --> 07:58.378
instead of why he is
singling out Parker.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.913
It can't just be about revenge.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.982
I mean, he would have
killed Parker by now.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.752
Instead of setting him up
just to destroy his good name.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.154
That's the end result,
isn't it?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.056
Parker's reputation
in the gutter.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.123
Well, who would that help?

08:10.223 --> 08:11.892
That's it.
If we can figure out

08:11.992 --> 08:13.727
who benefits from
Parker's downfall...

08:13.827 --> 08:15.896
It will lead us to finding
the big, ugly bird.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.532
Now we just need to figure out
how to figure it out.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.800
Oh, we'll figure it out.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.770
Starting with Parker's
FBI history?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.471
Yeah.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.180
So another new home
for your pomato?

08:33.280 --> 08:36.016
It wasn't exactly thriving
in the evidence tray.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.686
And if you ask me,
poor Polly's still in shock

08:38.786 --> 08:40.721
since you and Jess
smashed her first home.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.623
Yeah, again, Kase,
it was such a freak thing.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.592
I turned around really fast,
and then I didn't know that

08:44.692 --> 08:46.059
Agent Knight was passing by...

08:46.159 --> 08:48.896
You know, to be honest,
it's me who's in shock

08:48.996 --> 08:51.632
and just keeping myself busy
to avoid thinking about

08:51.732 --> 08:53.500
the Raven still being out there.

08:53.601 --> 08:56.403
Yeah, I've been somewhat
of a quiet mess myself lately.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.507
In my case, not so quiet.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.777
You know, just the slightest
ping or beep in here

09:03.877 --> 09:06.179
brings back all kinds of bad
memories of the lockdown.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.716
Okay, we can't rehash
that day too much, all right?

09:08.816 --> 09:10.884
It's not quite PTSD, but still.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.120
(ringtone blaring)
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

09:13.220 --> 09:14.321
What-what is it? What...

09:14.421 --> 09:15.856
(stammers, exhales slowly)

09:15.956 --> 09:17.991
Kasie, change your ringtone.
Yeah, no,

09:18.091 --> 09:20.327
I-I have been meaning to.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.529
No caller ID.
What if it's him?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.331
What if it's who?
(whispers): The Raven.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.233
(scoffs)
It's not the Raven.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.301
Kase, just calm down.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.404
I'm sure it is just--
Hello?

09:31.504 --> 09:33.206
Jimmy?
Yes.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.374
I thought I called Kasie.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.276
Oh, yes, you did, you did.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.146
Uh, hold on. Yeah.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.247
She's right here.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.415
Listen, I don't have much time.

09:42.515 --> 09:43.483
I'm gonna have to trust you both

09:43.583 --> 09:45.185
not to tell the team.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.788
Uh, not to tell them what?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.790
I just sent you
a phone number, Kasie,

09:49.890 --> 09:52.159
and I need you to trace it
for me and fast.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.962
Where'd you get the number?
From someone's burner phone.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.529
Someone?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.633
Don't worry about that, just
find me who they're texting.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.301
Sure, but, uh,
isn't tracing numbers

10:01.401 --> 10:02.936
more a McGee kind of thing?

10:03.036 --> 10:05.038
It is, but I'm not quite ready
for McGee

10:05.138 --> 10:07.775
or anybody else upstairs to know
what I'm thinking just yet.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.542
JIMMY:
And what are you thinking?

10:09.643 --> 10:11.211
Well, let's just hope I'm wrong.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.681
Text me when you have a name.
I gotta go.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.282
Hey, who was that?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.884
Just checking in with the team.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.418
Hey, I wouldn't mind
grabbing some breakfast,

10:18.518 --> 10:19.619
uh, before we get on the road.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.454
Hey, how about that
great omelet joint

10:21.554 --> 10:22.723
we went to on our honeymoon?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.625
Actually, I know another place
that has

10:25.726 --> 10:27.594
the best pancakes on earth.
What do you say?

10:27.695 --> 10:30.097
Well, who can say no to that?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.944
Call me crazy, but I may have
found someone who is benefitting

10:44.044 --> 10:45.946
from the warrant
for Parker's arrest.

10:46.046 --> 10:46.980
Put him up.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.917
Steven Mucha, 47, drug smuggler

10:50.017 --> 10:51.384
serving 20 years,
thanks to Parker.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.954
But his lawyer just filed
an appeal

10:54.054 --> 10:56.489
based on Parker's
brand-new fugitive status.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.291
Well, that didn't take long.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.659
And he is not alone.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.763
Milton Elassar, 39,
human trafficker

11:02.863 --> 11:04.564
that Parker put away
six years ago.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.834
Attorney is petitioning
for a retrial.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.636
So with Parker's reputation
suddenly in question,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.471
every crook on his hit parade
is gonna try to use this

11:11.571 --> 11:12.740
to get out of prison.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.808
It's like a slow-motion
jailbreak.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.977
More like opening
the flood gates.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.579
(phones chiming)

11:19.679 --> 11:21.181
KNIGHT:
Talk about bad timing.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.215
Tennant text you, too?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.583
No, this is Ernie.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.952
They're arriving
from Hawaii today

11:25.052 --> 11:26.787
to talk with Vance and SECNAV.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.956
Yeah, Tennant wants to have
lunch when they get in town.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.024
Well, not to be antisocial,
but I mean,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.826
you said it yourself,
this is bad timing.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.661
Yeah, we'll explain.
No big deal.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.196
Well, actually,
it is a big deal.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.831
I mean, we don't want to
explain too much about Parker.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.333
So keep everything
about Parker in-house?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.469
Family matter. Got it.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.804
Yeah.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.873
Any luck with Parker's
mystery number?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.407
Almost. Just waiting
for our database

11:47.507 --> 11:48.909
to put a name to it.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.610
Hey, what about the someone
who owns the burn phone?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.680
The someone Parker
didn't want to talk about?

11:53.781 --> 11:55.582
I'm digging up the credit card
that paid for it.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.384
Is that wrong?

11:57.484 --> 11:59.186
Can't be any harm
in looking, right?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.821
Yeah.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.457
"V. Kolchak"?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.127
Is that Vivian?
Parker's ex?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.962
But she's been with him
the whole time.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.698
Why not just ask her
who she's been texting?

12:11.799 --> 12:15.068
Unless, of course,
she's been compromised?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.737
Pancakes no good?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.273
No. No, they're great.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.441
I'm just, uh...

12:21.541 --> 12:22.675
I should have gone
for the blueberry.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.677
You used to love blueberry.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.680
I used to love a lot of things.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.117
(phone chimes)

12:34.121 --> 12:36.623
(phone chimes)

12:41.394 --> 12:42.662
Could have been worse.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.564
What could have? What's wrong?

12:44.664 --> 12:48.068
What's wrong, Viv, is I know.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
You know what?
What are you talking...

12:50.270 --> 12:53.106
You didn't think I would find
your burner phone text messages

12:53.206 --> 12:54.942
behind my back?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.545
I guess if you were gonna
sell me out,

12:58.645 --> 13:00.180
at least it wasn't to the Raven.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.915
The Raven. You thought I would
sell you out to the Raven?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.217
Don't start. Don't...

13:04.317 --> 13:05.652
Ooh!
Oh, my God.

13:05.752 --> 13:06.653
Park, don't!

13:06.753 --> 13:08.188
Ow. Napkins?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.289
Fornell?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.657
(groans)

13:10.757 --> 13:13.326
Yeah, he's here to help us.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.096
At least I was.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.765
(Fornell groans)

13:25.238 --> 13:27.574
Seriously, Park, the Raven.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.043
How could you think that
I would betray you like that?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.478
How could I not?
Texting Sweeney's

13:31.578 --> 13:32.913
not a whole lot better.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.716
Some might say worse.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.085
Tobias, please!

13:38.185 --> 13:40.954
Okay, Park, yeah,
Sweeney backchanneled me,

13:41.054 --> 13:44.958
somehow thinking that he could
leverage me into cooperating.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.793
What the hell did I
do to this guy

13:46.894 --> 13:47.895
in a previous life?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.262
First he bugs my place,

13:49.362 --> 13:50.730
now he's trying to
turn my ex against me.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.165
In my experience,

13:52.265 --> 13:55.468
that last part is pretty easy.
Tobias.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.170
But since Sweeney
thought so little

13:57.270 --> 13:58.605
of my personal integrity,

13:58.705 --> 14:01.174
I took it as an opportunity
to string him along.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.243
Keep our enemies closer.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.844
Yeah, well, he's not close now.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.947
At least according to
his last text.

14:07.047 --> 14:10.450
So you traced my phone instead
of just asking me, Park.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.585
I'm asking now.
Where's Sweeney?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.388
At the Perryville Diner
in Perryville,

14:15.488 --> 14:16.723
two towns over.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.792
Where he thinks that
I will be delivering you.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.666
Son of a bitch!
(horn honks)

14:29.336 --> 14:31.972
(phone chimes)

14:34.307 --> 14:36.609
Waiting patiently,
as you can see.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.918
This is the Clayton Avenue Café
in Port Deposit,

14:45.018 --> 14:46.519
where I arranged a meeting
with Fornell

14:46.619 --> 14:48.321
on a separate call.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.124
And I am so glad you did.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.360
You should have told me, Viv.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.795
I had my reasons.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.132
Yeah. Well, then...

14:59.232 --> 15:01.234
I don't know what to say.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.236
Say it's all gonna be worth it.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.439
As long as I can help
clear your name

15:06.539 --> 15:08.875
and piss off Sweeney
at the same time.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.278
Oh, come on.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.280
That empty suit
screwed me over, too.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.881
You recall?
Yeah, I do, Tobias.

15:14.982 --> 15:18.085
I appreciate that, but how
are you gonna help, exactly?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.120
Got a friend in Delaware.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.356
He practically wrote the book
on offshore accounts.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.659
If Sammy can't find
who's framing you,

15:26.759 --> 15:27.794
nobody can.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.629
Well, in that case,
I suggest that

15:29.729 --> 15:31.798
we get to Delaware
as soon as possible.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.100
Look, Viv...

15:33.200 --> 15:35.735
Just pay the check.
I'll see you at the car.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.373
You got to learn to trust,
my friend.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.776
Leave the tip.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.712
Take the pancakes.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.319
(phone chimes)

15:54.287 --> 15:56.289
What the... What?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.390
What the what what?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.159
This text from Jimmy.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.893
"FYI, Vivian's
totally not

16:00.994 --> 16:02.729
betraying Parker.
I'll explain later."

16:02.829 --> 16:04.697
Yeah, that does beg
a lot of questions.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.733
Like, who even said
she was?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.502
Oh, here's another
Parker convict

16:09.602 --> 16:11.304
who's filing
an appeal.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.672
Herman Maxwell,

16:12.772 --> 16:15.275
48, criminal hacking
and computer fraud.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.843
We're up to five now.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.278
We should be talking
to these guys.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.080
McGEE: Yeah, agreed.
Let's divvy them up.

16:20.180 --> 16:21.281
TENNANT:
Hey, guys.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.016
KNIGHT:
Special Agent Tennant. Ernie.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.285
Oh, hey.
TENNANT: Lucky us,

16:25.385 --> 16:26.286
you're still here.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.355
Hawaii's in the building!

16:28.455 --> 16:30.023
Hey.
(laughs)

16:30.123 --> 16:33.526
Agent Torres, it is
always a pleasure.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.663
When you said you guys
were super busy,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.331
I was worried
we might miss you.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.733
Ernie Malik,
Special Agent Tennant,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.469
I'm not sure if you know or...

16:42.569 --> 16:44.071
A very Special Agent Tim McGee.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.106
I can't believe
we've never crossed paths.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.775
Oh, believe it. She's been
trying to avoid you for years.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.244
Mm, no, it's you
I've been trying to avoid,

16:51.344 --> 16:52.879
but I can't seem to shake you.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.015
Listen, we'd love to stay,
we just wanted to say hi.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.451
We have all-day meetings
with Vance and SECNAV.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.520
It's final plans before RIMPAC.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.721
What is RIMPAC?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.091
It's a giant
logistical nightmare.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.925
It's a global military exercise,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.628
hosted by our Navy every two
years in the Rim of the Pacific.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.431
And every two years,
it's our team's job to provide

17:11.531 --> 17:13.100
Force Protection Assistance.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.702
Well, as fun as that sounds,
and we would love to help you,

17:15.802 --> 17:18.105
but our dance card
is pretty full right now.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.340
Oh, right. Any word from Parker?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.775
So much for keeping it
in the family.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.844
Well, we didn't
say anything.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.013
You didn't have to.
Word travels.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.316
TENNANT:
And since we are
extended family,

17:29.416 --> 17:31.851
we are happy to help Parker
in any way that we can.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.886
We really appreciate it,
you guys,

17:33.986 --> 17:36.089
but, uh, it's probably best
if you just stick to RIMPAC.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.492
Yeah, no need to, uh,
bring you into our mess.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.994
And what mess would that be,
Agent Torres?

17:43.430 --> 17:46.133
Uh, no mess in particular,
Director.

17:46.233 --> 17:50.170
Good. Well, when playtime is
over, Agent Tennant, Mr. Malik,

17:50.270 --> 17:51.904
SECNAV will be
joining us

17:52.004 --> 17:54.141
in MTAC in about three minutes.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.908
On our way, Director.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.179
Well, look, the offer stands.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.747
Good luck.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.315
Thanks.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.984
Hmm. Okay, bye.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.620
(chuckles)

18:07.720 --> 18:10.657
I really appreciate this, Sammy.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.593
Well, you got me out
of enough jams

18:13.693 --> 18:15.595
over the years, Toby.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.298
It's about time you let me
return the favor.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.533
You have to know
that I couldn't

18:20.633 --> 18:22.802
really imagine you siding with

18:22.902 --> 18:24.237
the Raven.
I got it, Park.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.273
Apology accepted.
You didn't know what to think.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.674
And I still don't.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.842
Like, why didn't you
tell me about Sweeney?

18:29.942 --> 18:32.345
Okay, if you had beat the crap
out of Sweeney like you did

18:32.445 --> 18:34.447
to poor old Fornell over there,
what would that do,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.649
besides end you up in prison
for the rest of your life?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.151
So you still think I'm that guy?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.019
I don't think. I know, I saw.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.921
What I did to Fornell
was a reflex.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.192
No, that was a replay
of the overprotective

18:45.292 --> 18:46.693
jerk that I once married.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
Are you the same person
you were back then?

18:48.861 --> 18:50.730
No, I like to think not,

18:50.830 --> 18:52.765
but old habits die hard, Park,

18:52.865 --> 18:54.667
and I did not tell you because,

18:54.767 --> 18:57.170
back in the day,
if there was even a hint

18:57.270 --> 19:00.707
of betrayal from anyone,
and that would set you off.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.744
So, please, you know how
I feel about you, and how

19:04.844 --> 19:07.747
I will always feel about you.
So, can we please

19:07.847 --> 19:09.682
just...
FORNELL: Hey, guys,

19:09.782 --> 19:12.151
we got something.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.420
(computer beeping)

19:13.520 --> 19:15.955
You ever been to Russia,
Agent Parker?

19:16.055 --> 19:17.557
Russia? No. Why?

19:17.657 --> 19:19.892
Your former partner's
offshore account,

19:19.992 --> 19:21.561
which is now being used
to frame you,

19:21.661 --> 19:24.531
was originally created
out of a bank in Moscow.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.199
Moscow?
You're sure?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.134
What'd I tell you?

19:28.235 --> 19:29.569
Sammy's the best.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.405
Yeah, come to think of it,
the, uh, the biotoxin

19:32.505 --> 19:33.806
that the Raven
tried to unleash

19:33.906 --> 19:36.476
on D.C. had Russian writing
on all the containers.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.579
Well, this account has Russian
written all over it, too.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.180
You still got it,
Sammy.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.250
Oh, stop, Toby,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.285
you're embarrassing me.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.721
(lock buzzes)

19:52.592 --> 19:54.461
Thank you.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.828
(sighs)

19:55.928 --> 19:57.497
Just heard
from Torres,

19:57.597 --> 19:59.466
headed back from
Martinsville Penitentiary.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.700
His interview
with Elassar

20:00.800 --> 20:02.269
went a lot like mine
with Mucha.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.638
Which I bet sounded a lot like
the last two interviews I had.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.807
Lawyers got word
of Parker's fugitive status

20:07.907 --> 20:09.676
and immediately
filed for appeals.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.245
Hmm. Could that be all
the Raven wants?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.981
Set up Parker so that
these cons get new trials?

20:15.081 --> 20:18.685
There are a few already filing
for emergency release.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.219
Like our next
interview.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.689
Herman Maxwell,
convicted hacker.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.791
GUARD (over P.A.):
Inmate H. Maxwell,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.193
report to the visitors' center.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.830
Uh, look,
understand, I have

20:30.930 --> 20:34.000
no animosity
for anyone at the FBI.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.569
I hate to admit it,
I got a little careless, and

20:36.669 --> 20:37.870
Agent Parker

20:37.970 --> 20:39.606
took me down fair and square.

20:39.706 --> 20:43.443
And when your lawyer informed
you of Parker's legal troubles?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.877
Well...

20:44.977 --> 20:47.113
all's fair in love
and the legal system,

20:47.213 --> 20:48.648
so whatever gets me out.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
Well, you'd still be
under house arrest,

20:50.683 --> 20:51.784
wearing an ankle monitor.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.152
Hey, I'll wear a bikini

20:53.252 --> 20:54.754
if it means getting
a shower to myself.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.990
All this, uh, communal living
is, uh, not for me.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.227
One last question:
does the word "Raven"

21:01.328 --> 21:02.862
mean anything to you?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.599
Or "The Unkindness"?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.468
Why are you asking me that?

21:08.568 --> 21:10.269
Well, we're asking all potential

21:10.370 --> 21:12.439
release candidates
the same question.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.873
And none so far have reacted

21:13.973 --> 21:15.942
quite the way that
you're reacting now.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.313
Like you've heard
the name before.
No.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.114
No. No, I never.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.884
I just, um...

21:24.984 --> 21:26.386
No.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.426
Okay.

21:33.526 --> 21:37.163
But it was, uh...
it was years ago.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.899
About 2013.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.068
Before Parker came along,

21:42.168 --> 21:44.671
I worked for a Russian oligarch.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.806
Uh, he's really
more of a gangster.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.108
Called himself "Voron."

21:49.208 --> 21:51.478
Voron?
Which is Russian for...

21:51.578 --> 21:53.112
Raven.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.048
What kind of work?

21:56.148 --> 21:59.218
He had me hacking
into some bio labs.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.788
Um... It was a very
lucrative gig.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.956
And Voron, he wasn't
in it for the money.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.760
I mean, he... he just got off
on creating chaos, you know?

22:07.860 --> 22:09.529
What kind of chaos?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.864
Mass panic.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.900
Guy was super into poisons,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.403
toxins,
nerve gases...

22:16.503 --> 22:17.904
This guy have a real name?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.840
I didn't know it then,
and I still don't want to.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.274
I may be paranoid, but I think

22:22.375 --> 22:24.444
he's been trying
to get to me in here.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.778
Yeah, like,
a few times.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.146
And why would he do that?

22:27.246 --> 22:29.749
Because I am the man
who knows too much.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.184
Then why is he targeting Parker?

22:33.152 --> 22:36.456
Wait-wait a minute. (stammers)
Is that why you guys are here?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.958
Is Voron the one

22:39.058 --> 22:40.693
setting Parker up?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.094
And what if he is?

22:42.194 --> 22:45.364
If he is, then he is just
trying to get to me.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.435
You don't understand.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.269
All Voron wants is a shot at me.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.304
But if that's true,
we'd protect you.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.340
You can't protect me.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.709
He is worse
than you can imagine.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.612
If you guys let me out of here,
it is gonna get ugly fast.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.581
All right, no, no.
Uh, I'm sorry.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.382
Uh, uh, I want
to call my lawyer!

23:03.483 --> 23:06.052
Take me back!
Hell, put me in solitary.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.421
There is no way
that I'm leaving here.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.868
So, this Maxwell,
he's our guy.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.836
He's the guy
Raven might be after.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.172
Or "Voron,"
as he called him.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.640
Either name in our database?

23:27.740 --> 23:30.843
No Ravens yet, but I've got
at least six Vorons.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.311
Yeah, make that seven.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.413
Who knew that "Voron"
was such a popular nickname

23:34.514 --> 23:35.982
amongst Russian gangsters.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.717
Yeah, and finding out
which one Maxwell worked for,

23:37.817 --> 23:39.318
that's gonna
take some time.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.853
Why don't you send me
some of those names?

23:40.953 --> 23:43.055
I mean, Kasie and I need
something to do on this case.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.191
Oh, you read
my mind, Jimmy.

23:45.291 --> 23:46.358
I'm getting good at that.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.728
Sure glad you can't read mine.

23:51.063 --> 23:52.298
Um, check your email.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.867
Yeah. We'll find him in no time.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.404
So that's it?

23:58.505 --> 24:00.973
No more wisecracks?
Huh?

24:01.073 --> 24:02.875
About what?

24:02.975 --> 24:04.410
About me and Jimmy.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.178
I mean, you can bust my chops,
but you don't bust his?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.980
Oh, no, never in front of you.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.448
It's, like, bro code.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.484
You know, you never
tease your buddy

24:11.584 --> 24:14.286
about their "special friend."

24:14.386 --> 24:16.255
Uh, especially
when they're in the room.

24:16.355 --> 24:19.759
Okay, one, bro code?
And two,

24:19.859 --> 24:22.028
Jimmy and I are not special,
we are just...

24:22.128 --> 24:23.630
friends.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.899
Okay, no, so you and I, friends.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.200
You and Jimmy,

24:28.300 --> 24:29.802
something else.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.371
Okay, well,
whatever Jimmy and I are,

24:32.471 --> 24:33.873
no one here's ever
gonna find out about it,

24:33.973 --> 24:35.975
and I'd really love
for you to keep it that way.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.546
You got it. And I'm sorry.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.080
Just got a little protective.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.481
I don't need protecting.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.751
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.
(chuckles)

24:44.851 --> 24:47.053
ERNIE:
Is that Herman Maxwell?

24:47.153 --> 24:49.188
Well, there's
a blast from the past.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.090
Huh.
You know Maxwell?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.626
Ernie never forgets a face,

24:53.726 --> 24:55.995
or a dessert,
or a Neil Diamond song.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.097
It's been a few years, but

24:58.197 --> 25:00.567
back in my old NSA days,
I put together the dossier

25:00.667 --> 25:02.569
that helped the FBI
put Maxwell away.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.637
Well, did a Russian
gangster named Voron

25:04.737 --> 25:06.272
pop up in
your dossier?

25:06.372 --> 25:07.907
Which one?

25:08.908 --> 25:11.811
If I recall, there's a
whole bunch of Vorons out there.

25:11.911 --> 25:12.912
I mean, again,

25:13.012 --> 25:14.547
if there's any help
we can offer

25:14.647 --> 25:15.915
before our flight
tomorrow...

25:16.015 --> 25:18.250
Well, pending on how
McGee and Parker do,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.286
we may need it.
Why, where are they?

25:20.386 --> 25:21.954
Well, Parker
was in Delaware

25:22.054 --> 25:24.557
with former FBI Agents
Fornell and Kolchak.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.826
But Dr. Parker

25:26.926 --> 25:29.095
is meeting McGee in the prison.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.565
Dr. Parker?

25:32.665 --> 25:35.134
(lock buzzes)

25:36.135 --> 25:37.804
Back so soon, Agent McGee?

25:37.904 --> 25:39.371
And...?

25:39.471 --> 25:40.807
This is Dr. Parker.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.643
Judge wants a psych eval
before she'll even consider

25:43.743 --> 25:45.612
releasing Maxwell.
Oh, this late?

25:45.712 --> 25:47.446
Well, the mysteries
of the human psyche

25:47.546 --> 25:49.048
are what keep me
on 24-hour call.

25:49.148 --> 25:51.317
Well, good luck.
According to Maxwell,

25:51.417 --> 25:52.551
he's not going anywhere.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.421
I'm surprised
he's even seeing you.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.658
Remind me to thank Grace

25:58.758 --> 26:00.993
for making me
"Doctor for a Day."

26:01.093 --> 26:02.795
She was happy to help.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.464
You're more popular
than you think.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.208
Hey. Hey,
was I not clear?

26:16.308 --> 26:17.443
I don't need
any psych eval

26:17.543 --> 26:18.711
because I am
not leaving.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.813
That's fine with us, Maxwell.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.749
Parker?

26:22.849 --> 26:25.618
Okay, uh, I didn't
recognize you-- the beard.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.253
Aren't you in trouble?

26:27.353 --> 26:28.520
That's what
they tell me.

26:28.621 --> 26:29.856
So, I could
turn you in right now.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.891
Not while he's in my custody.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.294
So, let's talk about
your buddy Voron.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.797
Voron. He's nobody's buddy.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.867
What is this? Is this-this
some kind of test?

26:40.967 --> 26:43.269
Does he know you're here?
Did he send you?

26:43.369 --> 26:44.704
Maxwell, calm down.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.405
We're still
the good guys here, okay?

26:46.505 --> 26:49.508
But why would he want you dead?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.744
Who said dead?
I never said he'd kill me.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.413
What I'm scared of
is way worse than that.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.648
What could be worse than that?

26:55.748 --> 26:57.283
He could put me back to work.

26:57.383 --> 27:00.653
Doing what?
Nothing good.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.857
(sighs)

27:04.957 --> 27:07.694
I don't even want
to think about it.

27:09.696 --> 27:13.833
So, if, uh, Raven
really wants Maxwell...

27:14.867 --> 27:16.568
You know what that makes him?

27:16.669 --> 27:17.970
I'm thinking live bait.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.638
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.540
Well, I hate
to tell you, Maxwell,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.076
but your appeal's
already been approved, so

27:24.176 --> 27:26.012
you're gonna be released
whether you want to go or not.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.081
What? No, no, no, no.
No, that's crazy.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.850
Well, it's like
you said earlier,

27:30.950 --> 27:33.019
"All's fair in love
and the legal system."

27:33.119 --> 27:35.855
No. I-I'd still be under
house arrest, right?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.957
A-And an ankle monitor?

27:38.057 --> 27:41.660
You guys would still
have to protect me.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.631
(knocks)
I hear somebody's Raven hunting.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.100
Hey, Ernie Malik.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.268
Hey. Hi.
Hi.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.536
Jimmy, and Kasie,
in the flesh.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.204
And in person, finally.
Yeah.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.473
Oh, you know, somehow
I thought you'd be taller.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.175
What? I'm five-ten and a half.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.277
I hear you're in town
prepping for RIMPAC.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.612
Uh, yeah, last-minute meetings,
but it can't stop me

28:00.713 --> 28:02.548
from saying hi and helping you
with your search.

28:02.648 --> 28:03.916
Jess tells me
you guys got

28:04.016 --> 28:06.452
seven Voron-slash-Raven
candidates.

28:06.552 --> 28:07.720
Oh, you know about Voron?

28:07.820 --> 28:09.188
And you're still
calling her Jess.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.090
Oh, yeah, protocol, right.
Agent Knight, of course.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.260
And, yes, Kasie, I know of
many more Vorons in my NSA days.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.062
Hey, and-and since you, uh,

28:16.162 --> 28:18.130
since you mentioned
Agent Knight...

28:18.230 --> 28:19.966
Well, actually,
you mentioned her, but it's...

28:20.066 --> 28:22.401
Well, I also mentioned protocol,
but embarrassing or not,

28:22.501 --> 28:23.535
uh, I have to ask,

28:23.635 --> 28:27.273
what exactly is her... sitch?

28:27.373 --> 28:29.275
As in her... situation?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.844
Yeah, I mean, I assume a woman
with her impeccable qualities

28:31.944 --> 28:35.314
can't possibly be unattached,
but, uh, is she?

28:35.414 --> 28:36.715
I believe...

28:36.816 --> 28:38.851
she is available.

28:38.951 --> 28:39.886
Yes!

28:39.986 --> 28:41.854
That's great!
(forced laugh)

28:41.954 --> 28:45.291
Yeah, that is,
other than... Rocco.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.793
Rocco?
Rocco?

28:46.893 --> 28:48.294
Yeah, she doesn't talk
about him much, you know,

28:48.394 --> 28:49.695
especially
at work, but, um,

28:49.796 --> 28:52.531
I met him once, and,
let me tell you, he is...

28:52.631 --> 28:55.201
one fantastic dude.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.668
Is he?

28:56.769 --> 28:57.870
Fantastic?

28:57.970 --> 29:00.006
Yeah, he's cool, he's kind,

29:00.106 --> 29:02.341
uh, he's very funny,
but in a corny sort of way.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.576
Super smart,
yeah, quite

29:04.676 --> 29:06.512
handsome,
but accessibly so.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.747
Um, I would say he's

29:08.848 --> 29:10.850
an all-around great guy.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.819
And I think I just realized

29:12.919 --> 29:15.454
how my pomato plant
really broke.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.089
It was still an accident, Kasie.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.757
(computer chirps)
Oh, look at that,

29:18.858 --> 29:21.393
we got a hit already.
Ooh, to be continued.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.829
A-a hit on what exactly?

29:22.929 --> 29:24.730
We ran a deep-dive
cross-reference

29:24.831 --> 29:26.632
with, uh, the seven Vorons
in our database

29:26.732 --> 29:30.402
against several keywords like
poison, biotoxins, hacking...

29:30.502 --> 29:32.839
And we got
Dimitri Lopuchin.

29:32.939 --> 29:34.306
Uh, uh, doesn't ring a bell.

29:34.406 --> 29:37.509
It says he's an "at-large
member of the Vory V Zaconia

29:37.609 --> 29:38.744
crime family."

29:38.845 --> 29:40.579
That rings a bell.
Very bad guys.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.014
"Current whereabouts,
unknown."

29:42.114 --> 29:43.850
You know, if I can connect

29:43.950 --> 29:45.617
with my old NSA contacts
from here,

29:45.717 --> 29:47.119
I might know a way to find him.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.856
Oh, by all means,
go ahead. Yeah.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.757
(chuckles) Yeah.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.292
Yeah...

29:53.392 --> 29:54.861
(whispers):
Rocco?

29:54.961 --> 29:56.728
(whispers):
I...

29:59.431 --> 30:01.100
Hey, yo.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.468
So, uh,

30:02.568 --> 30:03.702
you sure you can't stay
another day or two?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.238
Well, sure.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.740
Just got to tell
38 warships, four submarines,

30:08.841 --> 30:11.110
200 aircraft,
and all of their crew members

30:11.210 --> 30:12.778
to hold off
on their little exercise

30:12.879 --> 30:14.813
until after we are done
having brunch.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.116
Hey, I do know
a great brunch place.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.418
(chuckles) I'm sure you do.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.653
Look, you guys more than
have your hands full.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.991
Well, we're only doing
for Parker what he'd do for us.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.658
And what we'd do for each other.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.094
In a heartbeat.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.931
So...

30:32.031 --> 30:35.201
any chance of you
coming our way soon?

30:35.301 --> 30:36.535
You know, I...

30:36.635 --> 30:37.970
I thought about it.

30:38.070 --> 30:41.373
I never did get
to hike that volcano.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.676
Well, I do know one
with a great brunch place.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.378
Hey.

30:46.478 --> 30:49.248
Hate to break this up,
but McGee called.

30:51.283 --> 30:52.985
Hey, how did you know
we were back there?

30:53.085 --> 30:54.887
Women know things.

30:54.987 --> 30:57.023
And you weren't
exactly whispering.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.825
Anyway, uh,
McGee pulled some strings

30:59.926 --> 31:01.060
to speed up Maxwell's release.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.394
TORRES:
But I thought that

31:02.494 --> 31:03.930
Maxwell changed his mind
about getting out.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.098
Well, McGee and Parker
changed it back,

31:06.198 --> 31:07.299
and they want us all to move him

31:07.399 --> 31:08.935
to a safe house
tomorrow morning.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.070
Moving a prisoner
that the Raven's watching?

31:11.938 --> 31:13.039
He'll be all over us.

31:13.139 --> 31:14.873
Well, apparently,
that's the plan:

31:14.974 --> 31:16.976
use Maxwell to get
the Raven's attention.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.477
Force him out of the shadows.

31:18.577 --> 31:19.711
I like it.

31:19.811 --> 31:21.347
Yeah, there's just
one minor detail.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.016
Isn't Parker still a wanted man?

31:24.116 --> 31:25.952
KNIGHT:
Oh, bona fide fugitive, yes,

31:26.052 --> 31:27.819
so that only
gives us all one night

31:27.920 --> 31:29.888
to organize a very
low-key game plan.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.459
Okay, you've now said
"us all" twice,

31:33.559 --> 31:35.594
so I am taking that to mean...

31:35.694 --> 31:38.064
Extended family.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.402
(birds chirping)

31:43.502 --> 31:47.273
All right, next time, let's do
this after I had my coffee.

31:47.373 --> 31:50.242
Makes no difference to me.
My body's on Hawaii time.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.111
That reminds me,
I need a vacation.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.947
Come on, you mean to say
you don't miss this?

31:55.047 --> 31:57.383
Man, look at this all-star team.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.686
Thank you for not saying
"Old Timers Day."

32:00.786 --> 32:02.421
TORRES:
Hey, uh, Parker,

32:02.521 --> 32:03.889
good to see you again.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.357
Good to be seen.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.194
Agent Tennant,
nice of you to join us.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.262
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.498
And, uh, really,

32:12.598 --> 32:14.100
thanks,

32:14.200 --> 32:17.169
to, uh, to all of you.

32:18.337 --> 32:19.638
(lock buzzes)
Hey, how far away

32:19.738 --> 32:20.706
is this safe house again?

32:20.806 --> 32:22.208
About 15 miles.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.410
Just breathe, Maxwell.
You'll be fine.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.445
All right, let's, uh,
review one more time.

32:26.545 --> 32:28.447
All comms are set to
channel four.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.250
Ready, channel four.
Satellite link is a go.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.052
Public frequency
anyone can hear.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.720
Including your Raven, hopefully.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.623
If we get his attention between
here and the safe house...

32:37.723 --> 32:39.225
We'll be ready
for him.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.826
Does Maxwell know
that he's the bait?

32:40.926 --> 32:43.395
He's nervous enough
without knowing,

32:43.495 --> 32:45.031
so, uh...

32:45.131 --> 32:46.365
Speaking of which...

32:46.465 --> 32:48.667
Uh, whoa, whoa,
you know these people?

32:48.767 --> 32:49.735
They're with us.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.070
You're in good hands.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.705
Your chariot
awaits, Maxwell.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.641
I'm gonna sit in back?

32:55.741 --> 32:57.509
You'd prefer to ride shotgun?

32:57.609 --> 32:58.877
Yeah.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.878
Could I?

32:59.978 --> 33:02.348
No. Come on.

33:06.918 --> 33:08.087
KNIGHT:
Maxwell is secure.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.022
All teams confirm comms.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.723
FORNELL:
Comms check, car one.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.159
PARKER:
Comm check, car two.

33:13.259 --> 33:14.693
TENNANT:
Comms check, car three.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.195
McGEE:
Caravan on the move.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.630
Is everyone clear on our route
to the safe house?

33:18.730 --> 33:22.301
We're two miles from
a right turn on Eastchester.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.170
PARKER:
Road is clear.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.906
KNIGHT: Car three has visuals
on cars one and two.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.121
Teams, make a right turn

33:42.221 --> 33:43.422
on Eastchester.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.424
KNIGHT:
All cars turning on Eastchester.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.198
(phone ringing)

33:52.298 --> 33:53.665
(yelps)
What was that?

33:53.765 --> 33:55.401
Oh, shh, shh. Relax.
What was that? What was that?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.568
Relax, Kase. It's just...

33:56.668 --> 33:58.036
Victoria texting me
good morning.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.306
She stayed at her friend's
house last night.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.274
(yawns)
Yeah. We slept here.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.677
Yeah, we all passed out
around 2:00 a.m., waiting on

34:05.777 --> 34:08.514
Ernie's contact at the NSA
to come through.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.849
Unfortunately...
(alert blaring)

34:10.949 --> 34:12.017
What the hell?!
(gasping)

34:12.118 --> 34:13.685
I knew they'd
come through!

34:13.785 --> 34:15.221
NSA must have the location
of our Russian gangster!

34:15.321 --> 34:16.955
Aka the Raven!

34:17.055 --> 34:19.558
Left turn ahead on 12th Street.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.161
Left on 12th. Copy.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.699
Sorry we ever doubted you.
I never doubted him.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.368
(stammers) Neither did I.
I was just saying that...

34:29.468 --> 34:30.836
KASIE:
Oh, no, you just must
be thinking of Rocco.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.104
Lucky man,
that Rocco.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.440
Okay, can we just focus
on Dimitri, uh...

34:34.540 --> 34:35.507
What's his name
again?

34:35.607 --> 34:36.475
Lopuchin. Here he is.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.145
Alias, Voron. Yada yada.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.346
Former KGB operative.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.713
Russian mob captain.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.849
Okay, and what about
his current whereabouts?

34:44.650 --> 34:45.584
Oh, no.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.552
What, no location?

34:46.652 --> 34:47.886
No nothing.

34:47.986 --> 34:48.954
He's dead.

34:49.054 --> 34:49.921
Dead?

34:50.021 --> 34:51.157
Says here that he was killed

34:51.257 --> 34:53.992
by a rival Chechnyan gangster
in 2012.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.562
That's over a year before
Maxwell said he worked for him.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.264
Uh, he could have had
the dates wrong?

34:58.364 --> 35:00.299
JIMMY:
If this is the gangster
we're looking for

35:00.399 --> 35:01.767
and he's
actually dead...

35:01.867 --> 35:03.635
No, NSA seems sure
of both things.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.604
Okay, then who was
Maxwell talking about?

35:05.704 --> 35:07.239
S-Something stinks
really bad.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.574
We need
to contact our team.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.409
Okay, I got Parker.
I got Knight.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.510
I got Tennant.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.245
(phones beeping)
Call failed.

35:13.345 --> 35:14.513
JIMMY:
Mine, too.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.548
What? Of all
three phones?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.617
That's weird.
Keep trying.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.220
(phones beeping)

35:23.088 --> 35:24.623
(sighs)
Hey, are we almost there?

35:24.723 --> 35:25.691
I got to pee.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.026
Told you to go before we left.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.931
Hold it. There's
channel four interference

35:33.031 --> 35:35.066
originating
from the next intersection.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.571
And he's emitting
some kind of signal jammer.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.906
You should...
(feedback screeches)

35:43.442 --> 35:44.443
Oh, hell.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.445
(feedback screeching)

35:46.545 --> 35:48.347
(groans)
What the hell?

35:48.447 --> 35:49.481
(groans)

35:49.581 --> 35:51.116
Someone's jamming
the signal.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.157
There you go. Nine o'clock.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.728
KNIGHT:
They took the bait. Here we go.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.233
Get us back online.
We're trying, Director.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.134
Let's go. Fix it.

36:09.235 --> 36:11.837
Fix it, damn it!
Get us back online!
Yes, sir.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.839
All right. Hang on.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.347
Black SUV.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.283
Is he gonna hit us?

36:24.383 --> 36:26.084
(tires screeching)

36:29.621 --> 36:30.889
FBI!

36:30.989 --> 36:32.658
Sweeney? You kidding me?

36:32.758 --> 36:33.592
Hey, what's going on?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.461
Do not leave this car.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.496
Wh-Where the hell
am I gonna go?!

36:37.596 --> 36:38.730
Sweeney!

36:38.830 --> 36:40.566
Got you now, Parker!

36:40.666 --> 36:41.967
You can arrest me later!

36:42.067 --> 36:44.270
We're transporting a prisoner.
He's in the car!

36:44.370 --> 36:45.904
Stop where you are! Hands!

36:46.004 --> 36:47.539
This is a really bad time!

36:47.639 --> 36:49.375
Not leaving without you, Parker.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.981
(gunfire continues)

37:00.786 --> 37:02.053
You good?

37:02.588 --> 37:03.855
Come on. Come on.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.658
(tires screech)

37:06.758 --> 37:08.627
Who the hell
are these guys?!

37:12.364 --> 37:13.965
Cover me.
Okay.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.337
(panting)

37:21.239 --> 37:22.240
(grunts)

37:24.776 --> 37:26.945
(gunfire continues)

37:36.555 --> 37:37.489
Get out of the car!

37:37.589 --> 37:39.391
Move! Come on!

37:39.491 --> 37:40.959
Viv!

37:44.663 --> 37:45.597
Parker!

37:45.697 --> 37:47.766
He's got Maxwell!

37:48.534 --> 37:49.668
Get him out of here!

37:50.302 --> 37:52.037
(gasps)

38:04.015 --> 38:06.752
(tires screeching)

38:10.389 --> 38:11.690
(groaning)

38:11.790 --> 38:14.426
(distant sirens wailing)

38:14.526 --> 38:17.028
Okay. All right.
Okay. I got you.
I'm-I'm hit, I'm hit.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.630
I got you, I got you.
It's okay.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.031
(groans)

38:20.131 --> 38:21.933
Somebody call
an ambulance.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.237
Hang in there. I got you.
(breathing heavily)

38:27.272 --> 38:29.741
It's okay.
(shuddering)

38:31.343 --> 38:33.278
Hey, the moment they land,
we will, of course.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.646
Director.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.448
Yeah, I understand.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.384
Hey. Hey.
How is she?

38:39.451 --> 38:40.619
She's still in surgery.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.521
But, uh, doctors
seem positive though.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.922
Thank God for that.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.757
(exhales) All right,
what do you guys know?

38:45.857 --> 38:47.859
Don't even worry about it.
Don't worry about it?
You kidding me?

38:47.959 --> 38:49.595
It's okay, Alden.
No.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.530
No, it's not okay.
Just talk to me.

38:51.630 --> 38:53.131
Come on.
Prints confirm

38:53.231 --> 38:55.367
that the shooters we took down
were part of the Unkindness.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.768
Devotees of the Raven.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.438
They somehow managed
to jam our comms

38:59.538 --> 39:01.006
just before taking Maxwell.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.542
They didn't take Maxwell.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.810
What do you mean?

39:04.910 --> 39:07.078
He's the one
who hacked the comm grid.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.580
But we had him in custody.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.549
I knew it the minute
he smiled at me.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.683
Knew what?

39:11.783 --> 39:14.553
Maxwell is the Raven.

39:14.653 --> 39:15.821
He's been
orchestrating this,

39:15.921 --> 39:16.922
the long con,

39:17.022 --> 39:18.424
from his jail cell.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.591
How?

39:19.691 --> 39:20.692
Think about it, McGee.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.628
Prison Internet, burner phones.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.597
It would take a lot of work
and a very long time to do that.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.133
Which he had plenty of.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.868
All to bust himself out
of prison

39:29.968 --> 39:32.303
and then get even with me
as a bonus.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.139
Okay. Couple of things.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.341
In light of today's events,
the FBI has agreed

39:36.442 --> 39:38.710
to suspend all charges,
pending further investigation.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.045
Whatever.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.713
Our team find Maxwell?

39:41.813 --> 39:43.649
They found
his broken ankle monitor

39:43.749 --> 39:45.150
inside a shot-up delivery van

39:45.250 --> 39:46.985
near an abandoned airfield
in Maryland.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.153
Private jet?
Right.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.655
Took off soon after
the shooting.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.156
Turned off its transponders.

39:51.256 --> 39:53.058
Promptly disappeared
from radar.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.594
FAA has its destination
as Hawaii,

39:55.694 --> 39:57.663
but, at this point, we don't
know what's real and what's not.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.831
No, Hawaii is not
an easy place to hide.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.467
Maybe he's not hiding.

40:01.567 --> 40:02.400
What then?

40:02.501 --> 40:03.602
Another target?

40:03.702 --> 40:04.970
Like RIMPAC.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.872
I'm gonna call
Knight and Torres.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.273
Already boarding a C-130

40:08.373 --> 40:10.141
with Agent Tennent
and Mr. Malik as we speak.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.210
Parker, I can hold that flight
if you want to join them.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.045
No. No, thanks.
I'm staying with Viv.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.015
TORRES: Yo, McGee.
Torres, hey,
you on your way?

40:17.816 --> 40:18.750
Nick, it's Parker.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.985
You got Knight with you?

40:20.085 --> 40:22.320
Yeah.
Good. Put me on speaker.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.792
All right, you
got both of us.

40:26.892 --> 40:27.893
Is Vivian okay?

40:27.993 --> 40:29.327
She will be. But I need you both

40:29.427 --> 40:31.362
to promise me something.
Name it.

40:31.463 --> 40:34.432
Go take down
that son of a bitch!
