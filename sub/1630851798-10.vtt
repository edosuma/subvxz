Sorry to interrupt

Murf found the engine room.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.136
Oh, well done.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.756
Nice going, Rok.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.324
Huh?
The Watchers are back on?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.195
Hurry! Get in!

04:03.808 --> 04:07.029
If the Watchers are back on,
that means--

04:07.116 --> 04:08.160
We gotta fix this engine
and get outta here.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.556
Whoa.

04:12.643 --> 04:16.386
Oh boy,
they really toasted the place.

04:16.473 --> 04:18.475
Keep that hatch shut
while Jankom works his magic.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.260
You know,
I can do more stuff

04:20.347 --> 04:21.913
than hold a door.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.440
Uh...uh-oh.

04:26.527 --> 04:30.139
Didn't know you could
fix an engine by staring at it.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.663
The--the blast emptied
the entire energy core.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.099
So let Jankom figure it out.

04:34.186 --> 04:38.452
Uh, unless
you've got a better idea.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.936
What if you interplex
the plasma conduits,

04:45.023 --> 04:48.940
adjust for input variances
in the dilithium matrix,

04:49.027 --> 04:51.203
and siphon off the energy
of the Proto-Core

04:51.291 --> 04:53.162
to jump-start it?
- Uhh...

04:53.249 --> 04:54.729
New plan!

04:54.816 --> 04:58.733
Jankom holds the door,
and you do all of that.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.561
Stay close, Murf.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.607
We're gonna need
some of that juice.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.969
It's okay, little one.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.797
I won't hurt you.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.886
It's time we leave this place.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.196

Ohh--

Zero!

05:34.334 --> 05:37.249
Are you okay?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.816
I'll manage.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.992
Never had
much control of them anyway.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.777
We'll never get everyone
onto the ship

05:42.864 --> 05:44.605

communicators.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.998
There has to be a faster way.

How's that power coming?

05:57.966 --> 05:59.533
Almost there.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.404
Well, they're almost here!

06:10.152 --> 06:10.805

Yeah.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.195
They did it.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.936
They did it!

06:55.023 --> 06:56.198
They've done it!

06:57.765 --> 07:00.507

could you at least keep quiet?

07:06.338 --> 07:08.079
I can't concentrate.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.518
Just...need...

07:11.605 --> 07:13.345

war splintered our people

comes into contact

15:41.766 --> 15:43.159

corrupt their systems,

15:57.043 --> 16:01.003
Starfleet will welcome

apart from within!

16:06.661 --> 16:09.316

16:10.012 --> 16:13.276
Once Starfleet falls to ruin,

16:13.363 --> 16:17.150
