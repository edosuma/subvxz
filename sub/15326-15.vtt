08:36.182 --> 08:39.936
YOU KNOW, EVIDENCE?

08:40.019 --> 08:40.770
- OH, NO REASON TO PANIC,

08:40.852 --> 08:42.980
THOUGH I ENJOY WATCHING IT.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.982
WE'LL JUST CALL
YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY

08:45.066 --> 08:45.650
FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.652
- ACTUALLY, I PAID CASH.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.654
- OH.
I GET IT.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.781
- OH, GOOD.
THANK YOU.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.616
- YOUR MOTHER WOULDN'T LET YOU
BUY THE PANTS

08:53.699 --> 08:54.617
SO YOU STOLE THEM.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.618
SECURITY!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.495
- WHAT?
NO--NO!

08:57.578 --> 08:57.662
I'M GOING!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.792
- I DO LOVE IT WHEN THEY RUN.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.256
- THERE YOU ARE, GABBY.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.967
- PLEASE DO NOT APPROACH
THE PERP.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.927
- "THE PERP"?

09:13.010 --> 09:14.262
REALLY?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.472
- SIR,
YOUR DAUGHTER TRIED TO EXECUTE

09:16.555 --> 09:18.140
A TEXTBOOK "GRAB AND RUN."

09:18.224 --> 09:19.767
- GABBY, IS THIS TRUE?

09:19.850 --> 09:20.434
- OF COURSE NOT, DAD.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.311
both: THIS IS CRAZY.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.396
I PAID FOR THEM.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.815
WOULD YOU STOP DOING THAT?

09:25.898 --> 09:28.025
- TRUST ME.
I'VE HEARD IT ALL.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.277
both: I BELIEVE MY DAUGHTER.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.530
both: SHE'S A GOOD GIRL.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.656
- CUT THAT OUT.

09:33.739 --> 09:34.365
WHAT ARE WE ON,<i> HIDDEN CAMERA?</i>

09:34.448 --> 09:36.701
- CAMERAS!
YES!

09:36.784 --> 09:39.370
LOOK AT THE SECURITY CAMERAS,
AND YOU'LL SEE I PAID!

09:39.453 --> 09:40.663
- THAT'S JUST FOR SHOW.

09:40.746 --> 09:41.956
THE REAL CAMERAS ARE RIGHT HERE.

09:42.039 --> 09:46.252
- LISTEN, MA'AM,
CAN'T I JUST PAY FOR THEM?

09:46.335 --> 09:47.378
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.089
WE HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY
FOR SHOPLIFTERS.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.467
- YOU DO WORK ON COMMISSION,
DON'T YOU?

09:53.551 --> 09:54.844
- CASH OR CHARGE?

09:54.927 --> 09:56.053
- CHARGE.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.763
- SWEETIE, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.180
- I'M SO ANGRY.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.182
I PAID!

10:00.266 --> 10:01.517
SOMEONE JUST FORGOT
TO TAKE OFF THE SECURITY TAG.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.019
- IT'S OKAY.
WE BELIEVE YOU.

10:03.102 --> 10:03.561
- OF COURSE WE DO.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.146
- ALL SET, THEN.

10:05.229 --> 10:05.896
HERE THEY ARE.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.190
THAT'S $200 PLUS TAX.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.942
- WHA--

10:10.026 --> 10:11.861
- YOU STOLE THOSE JEANS!

10:13.696 --> 10:14.864
- CONSIDERING THE FAMILY,

10:14.947 --> 10:16.866
I'M GONNA NEED TO SEE
SOME I.D.

10:21.495 --> 10:24.498
- CHARLIE, STOP BEING SO BLIND!

10:24.582 --> 10:26.292
- I KNOW MY DAUGHTER.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.669
SHE MAY HAVE SPENT WAY,
WAY TOO MUCH ON THESE JEANS,

10:28.753 --> 10:29.879
BUT SHE DIDN'T STEAL THEM.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.881
- YOU'RE IGNORING THE MATH,
CHARLIE.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.299
- OH, THERE'S MATH?

10:33.382 --> 10:34.383
- I WOULDN'T BUY HER THE JEANS.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.509
NOW SHE HAS THE JEANS.

10:35.593 --> 10:39.221
ONE PLUS ONE
EQUALS $200 PLUS TAX.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.057
[doorbell rings]

10:43.893 --> 10:45.561
YOU'RE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE,
YOUNG LADY.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.438
THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE PLAYING AROUND OUTSIDE.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.773
- I'M NOT PLAYING.

10:48.856 --> 10:49.565
YOU DIDN'T LET ME TALK
ALL THE WAY HOME,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.735
AND THEN YOU LOCKED ME OUT.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.278
- GABBY,
THIS CAN ALL BE EASILY SOLVED

10:54.362 --> 10:55.780
IF YOU JUST SHOW US THE RECEIPT.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.073
- I CAN'T.

10:57.156 --> 10:57.740
I SHREDDED IT
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE

10:57.823 --> 10:59.408
THAT I BOUGHT THE JEANS.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.410
- WHERE DID YOU EVEN
GET THE $200?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.121
- ...MOLLY.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.498
- MOLLY!

11:05.581 --> 11:06.999
THERE, THAT'S SETTLED.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.463
- DON'T TELL ME
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE

11:12.546 --> 11:14.423
MOLLY LOANED HER $200.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.591
- I DO.

11:15.674 --> 11:16.717
WHY DON'T YOU?

11:16.801 --> 11:18.928
- BECAUSE ONCE
I WAS A TEENAGE GIRL.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.930
- AND YOU STOLE JEANS?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.849
- NO, BUT I CHEATED ON TESTS,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.017
HAD A FAKE I.D.,

11:25.101 --> 11:26.352
AND ON OCCASION
BORROWED MY MOM'S CAR

11:26.435 --> 11:29.939
WHEN MAYBE SHE DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS BEING BORROWED.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.732
- GREAT.
I MARRIED A FELON.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.484
- [sighs]
YOU MARRIED A WOMAN.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.820
AND PART
OF GETTING TO BE A WOMAN

11:35.903 --> 11:37.613
IS GOING THROUGH
A HIGH CRIME AREA

11:37.697 --> 11:40.574
KNOWN AS TEENAGE GIRLHOOD.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.953
- YOU MAKE TEENAGE GIRLHOOD
SOUND A LOT LIKE BALTIMORE.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.329
- HONEY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.622
THE PRESSURE!

11:46.705 --> 11:49.458
WEAR THESE CLOTHES,
BUY THESE SHOES, TAG THIS BUS--

11:49.542 --> 11:50.459
- "TAG THIS BUS"?

11:50.543 --> 11:53.129
WHO ARE YOU?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.255
- I DIDN'T SAY I DID IT.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.297
I SAID THERE WAS PRESSURE.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.925
AND IT WAS AN OLD BUS.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.969
SHE DID THIS, CHARLIE.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.639
YOU CAN'T SEE IT BECAUSE
YOU WEREN'T A TEENAGE GIRL.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.307
- OR SHE DIDN'T DO IT,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.309
AND YOU CAN'T SEE IT
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T EVEN HERE

12:07.393 --> 12:08.894
FOR THE FIRST
14 YEARS OF HER LIFE.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.148
- OH.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.315
SO I DON'T KNOW HER
AS WELL AS YOU DO

12:13.399 --> 12:15.234
BECAUSE I'M NEW?

12:15.317 --> 12:17.319
- IN THIS CASE, YES.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.405
- FINE,
THEN PREPARE TO BE WRONG,

12:19.488 --> 12:21.323
BECAUSE ON THIS ONE,
I PROMISE YOU,

12:21.407 --> 12:24.910
FORMER TEENAGE GIRL
TRUMPS OUT-OF-TOUCH OLD DAD.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.330
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

12:28.414 --> 12:31.709
I <i> WAS</i> ONCE A TEENAGE GIRL.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.171
I PLAYED MARIA IN A BOYS' SCHOOL
PRODUCTION OF <i> WEST SIDE STORY,</i>

12:35.254 --> 12:36.839
AND I WAS PRETTY AND WITTY
AND BRIGHT!

12:40.759 --> 12:41.677
- YOU...

12:41.760 --> 12:42.845
YOU.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.223
YOU TOLD DAD AND STEPH
ABOUT THE JAMPORIUM.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.808
I HEARD THEY GRILLED YOU
ABOUT THE JEANS.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.685
- I DIDN'T GIVE YOU UP,
ALL RIGHT?

12:49.768 --> 12:53.189
I TOLD THEM
MOLLY LENT ME THE MONEY.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.065
- REALLY?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.525
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

12:56.609 --> 12:59.403
- BECAUSE I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

12:59.487 --> 13:03.199
- SO?
I GIVE LOTS OF PEOPLE MY WORD.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.576
- YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT YOU.

13:05.659 --> 13:09.497
- SO YOU REALLY, TRULY
DIDN'T GIVE ME UP?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.499
- NO.

13:11.582 --> 13:14.502
- THEN I REALLY, TRULY
DIDN'T SLASH YOUR BICYCLE TIRES.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.797
BUT SOMEBODY DID,
SO I WILL NOW GO FIX THEM.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.644
- YOU SUMMONED?

13:31.727 --> 13:33.312
- I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD BE HERE
FOR THE INTERROGATION.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.397
- INTERROGATION?

13:35.481 --> 13:36.398
GABBY ALREADY TOLD US
EVERYTHING.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.483
WHO ARE WE INTERROGATING?

13:37.566 --> 13:37.942
[knock at back door]

13:41.028 --> 13:42.404
- MOLLY.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.116
- HI, MR. AND MRS. PHILLIPS.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.619
I'M SORRY TO STOP BY SO LATE,
BUT GABBY TEXTED ME.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.412
SHE SAID IT WAS AN EMERGENCY--

13:50.496 --> 13:51.413
- AND YOU HAVE TO COME
RIGHT AWAY.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.457
I SENT THAT TEXT.
HAVE A SEAT.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.795
- WOW.
THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.090
- OKAY.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.758
WHAT'S UP?

14:02.841 --> 14:06.345
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL US
WHAT'S UP.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.058
- WELL, IN FIFTH PERIOD TODAY,

14:11.141 --> 14:14.061
JEREMY MCMULLEN
TOTALLY CHEATED OFF OF MY TEST,

14:14.144 --> 14:15.646
WHICH IS ADORABLE.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.856
[giggles]

14:17.940 --> 14:18.566
- LOOK, LITTLE GIRL,

14:18.649 --> 14:20.776
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT

14:20.859 --> 14:22.611
LOAN GABBY $200
TO BUY JEANS?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.780
- THE JEAN-VAL JEANS?

14:24.863 --> 14:27.199
- MOLLY, GABBY SAID YOU DID.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.326
- OBJECTION.
LEADING THE WITNESS.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.953
- OBJECTION.
NOT A TRIAL.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.957
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.251
YES, I DID LOAN GABBY MONEY.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.335
- I KNEW IT!
- LIAR!

14:40.254 --> 14:42.256
- IF I WANTED
TO SEE PARENTS FIGHT,

14:42.339 --> 14:43.591
I COULD JUST GO HOME.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.471
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.639
- YEAH.
MM-HMM.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.266
MM-HMM.
SEE?

14:52.349 --> 14:52.933
GABBY DIDN'T DO IT.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.852
MOLLY BACKED HER UP.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.604
- HONEY,
I KNOW SOMETHING IS GOING ON.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.814
I MAY BE NEW AT THIS,

14:58.897 --> 15:00.733
BUT I'M THE ONE
WITH THE KIDS ALL DAY.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.986
I HAVE A SIXTH SENSE FOR
WHEN THEY'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.530
NOTHING GETS PAST ME.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.493
- HERE'S YOUR CUT, RONNIE.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.495
I HOPE YOUR GIRLFRIEND
STARTS TREATING YOU BETTER.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.997
- OH, SHE DUMPED ME.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.792
I'M GOING TO USE THIS TO BUY
T-SHIRTS LIKE MY OLD T-SHIRTS.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.003
IT WON'T BE THE SAME.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.674
- WOW, I FEEL BAD FOR RONNIE.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.092
- I JUST FEEL BAD...

15:27.176 --> 15:30.596
WHICH IS WEIRD
BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A KILLING.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.139
- DO YOU NEED
TO LOOK AT THE MONEY?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.269
- NOPE.

15:37.353 --> 15:37.978
IT'S NOT WORKING.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.521
I STILL FEEL TERRIBLE.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.190
- THIS IS NOT LIKE YOU.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.442
- I KNOW.
WE'RE WORKING THE PERFECT SCAM.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.736
BUSINESS IS BOOMING.

15:45.819 --> 15:48.072
WE'VE ALMOST MADE ENOUGH
TO BUY THE BIG TV.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.198
NOT TOO GABBY.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.117
SHABBY.

15:52.201 --> 15:52.993
OH, NO!

15:53.077 --> 15:54.495
I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT'S WRONG.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.829
I HAVE...

15:55.913 --> 15:57.581
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.584
- I KNEW THAT.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.045
BUT YOU HAD TO GET THERE
ON YOUR OWN.

16:09.927 --> 16:10.844
- HEY.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.889
- HEY, SON, WHAT'S WRONG?

16:13.972 --> 16:16.725
- ACTUALLY, I'M FEELING
REALLY BAD ABOUT SOMETHING.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.935
- YEAH?

16:18.018 --> 16:22.231
- I LOANED GABBY
THE $200 FOR HER JEANS.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.190
- UH-HUH.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.692
AND HOW DID YOU
GET THIS $200?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.068
- I'VE BEEN GOING ONLINE

16:26.151 --> 16:28.487
AND SELLING THE STUPID
WEDDING GIFTS

16:28.570 --> 16:29.655
YOU'VE NEVER USED...

16:32.157 --> 16:35.077
LIKE THE WAFFLE IRON
AND THE PANINI PRESS.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.871
CONFESSING SEEMED LIKE
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.123
SORRY.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.296
- DID JAMES JUST SAY,
"THE RIGHT THING TO DO"?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.424
- I HAVE A PANINI PRESS?

16:48.507 --> 16:49.550
both: HE'S LYING.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.221
- WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOU

16:54.304 --> 16:56.473
AND YOUR LITTLE CRIME SPREE.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.600
- WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
GET THE MONEY FROM MOLLY.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.935
- JAMES SAID HE GAVE IT TO YOU.

17:00.018 --> 17:00.853
- HE DID?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.062
SO YOU KNOW I'M INNOCENT!

17:02.146 --> 17:02.855
- NO,
I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE BRIBED HIM

17:02.938 --> 17:04.106
TO GET HIM TO COVER FOR YOU.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.108
- AND I KNOW
WE DON'T HAVE A PANINI PRESS.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.612
- JAMES DOESN'T JUST CONFESS.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.281
AND IF HE REALLY WERE RUNNING
SOME CRAZY INTERNET BUSINESS,

17:12.364 --> 17:15.075
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST
RAT HIM OUT LIKE USUAL?

17:15.159 --> 17:17.327
- BECAUSE THIS TIME,
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.788
AND MY WORD MEANS SOMETHING...

17:19.872 --> 17:21.165
TO ME AT LEAST.

17:23.541 --> 17:28.380
- FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
I WANTED TO BELIEVE YOU, GABBY.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.132
BUT IF WE OVERLOOK THIS,

17:30.215 --> 17:31.216
IT'S ON TO CHEATING ON TESTS

17:31.300 --> 17:34.678
AND TAGGING BUSSES
AND STEALING CARS--

17:34.762 --> 17:36.054
- STEALING CARS, WHO DOES THAT?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.519
- WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT YOU
AS OUR DAUGHTER.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.271
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE WHOLE PICTURE.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.274
AND EVERYTHING IS TELLING US
THAT YOU ARE...

17:47.357 --> 17:48.692
- INNOCENT.
- GUILTY.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.902
- I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.029
BUT THE GIRL
YOU JUST DESCRIBED,

17:52.112 --> 17:54.531
THAT WAS ME, NOT GABBY.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.699
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT,

17:55.783 --> 17:58.410
BUT I KNOW
SHE DIDN'T STEAL THE JEANS.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.121
- WHERE WAS ALL THIS CONFIDENCE

18:01.205 --> 18:03.457
WHEN YOU HAD ME LOOKING INTO
SCARED STRAIGHT PROGRAMS?

18:06.085 --> 18:10.088
- HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
I CAN GET FOR THIS STINKY STUFF?

18:10.172 --> 18:10.839
- THAT'S NOT STINKY STUFF.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.008
THAT'S MY PERFUME.

18:13.091 --> 18:15.010
YOU GET THIS ONLY WHEN
YOU PURCHASE THE JEANS.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.553
THIS PROVES I'M INNOCENT.

18:16.637 --> 18:17.971
- I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.225
- YOU WHAT?

18:21.308 --> 18:22.309
- THANK YOU, STEPHANIE.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.228
I'M GLAD SOMEONE BELIEVED ME.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.187
- SOMEONE--

18:25.270 --> 18:26.188
NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.564
SEE, 'CAUSE SHE--

18:27.648 --> 18:28.774
WAIT, WAIT.
I--

18:28.857 --> 18:29.900
- I BELIEVED YOU, GABBY.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.109
THEY JUST HAD
TO GET THERE ON THEIR OWN.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.322
- THIS IS GREAT.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.032
I CAN FINALLY WEAR MY JEANS.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.951
- OH, NO,
YOU'RE NEVER WEARING $200 JEANS.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.494
- WHAT?
I GET NOTHING?

18:40.577 --> 18:41.912
THAT'S SO TYPICAL.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.705
- OR IF YOU'D LIKE,
YOU CAN GET GROUNDED

18:43.789 --> 18:44.623
FOR BUYING JEANS
YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED TO.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.582
- I'M GOOD.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.584
THANK YOU, DADDY.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.212
THANK YOU, STEPHANIE.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.881
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
MY DAUGHTER'S INNOCENT.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.800
THE BAD NEWS IS,
MY WIFE THREW ME UNDER THE BUS.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.218
AND THEN TAGGED THE BUS.

18:56.301 --> 19:00.722
- LET'S NOT LIVE IN THE PAST,
CHARLIE.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.932
- THIS WAS A TOUGH ONE.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.601
- YEAH, I THOUGHT
I WAS GETTING THREE KIDS.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.937
AND NOW IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
TURNING INTO FULL PEOPLE...

19:07.020 --> 19:09.439
ALL COMPLICATED AND DIMENSIONAL.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.484
- THIS MEANS JAMES
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH

19:12.568 --> 19:15.779
ABOUT SELLING OUR WEDDING GIFTS
TO DEFEND HIS SISTER...

19:15.863 --> 19:17.614
WHICH MAKES ME PROUD...

19:17.698 --> 19:19.241
AND HOPEFUL...

19:19.324 --> 19:20.993
YET ALSO ANGRY...

19:21.076 --> 19:23.745
AND TORN ALL OVER AGAIN.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.497
- OH, STOP MAKING THIS
ABOUT YOU.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.082
I JUST LOST A PANINI PRESS
I NEVER KNEW I HAD!

19:27.165 --> 19:29.877
AND YOU ALL KNOW,
I LOVE MY PANINI!

19:35.257 --> 19:36.758
- SO DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET
CLOSE TO $200 FOR THE JEANS?

19:36.842 --> 19:39.052
THEY ARE NEW WITH TAGS.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.096
- MY CUSTOMERS
ARE DISCRIMINATING.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.265
THEY KNOW TAGS CAN BE FAKED.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.975
JUST LIKE WHEN AARON AND I
GOT YOU THAT

19:45.058 --> 19:46.977
"NEW WITH TAGS" DRESS
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.145
- THE BLUE ONE?

19:48.228 --> 19:48.937
I LOVE THAT DRESS!

19:49.021 --> 19:49.980
- SO DID BILLY'S MOM.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.232
I GOT IT OUT OF HER CLOSET.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.860
OH, WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.821
JEAN-VAL JEANS ARE TRENDING UP
AND SELLING OUT.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.783
SO LET'S SAY BUY IT NOW
FOR $185.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.495
[keys clacking]

20:05.579 --> 20:07.122
[computer chimes]
- [gasps] OOH!

20:07.205 --> 20:09.291
SOMEONE ALREADY BOUGHT IT!

20:09.374 --> 20:12.502
THAT IS AMAZING AND SO EASY!

20:12.586 --> 20:14.963
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE I CAN SELL
FROM MY CLOSET.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.382
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

20:17.466 --> 20:18.592
YOUR DAD'S CLOSET.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.135
I LOVE MY STUFF.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.848
- HEY, JAMES.

20:24.932 --> 20:25.807
- LET ME GUESS.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.017
YOU NEED TO BORROW $185.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.311
- PLUS SHIPPING AND HANDLING.
