01:26.280 --> 01:29.159
Thank you for the favour
you're doing me.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.239
This woman's been the worst
disappointment of my life.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.679
Now I'll take care of it
and we'll move on.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.519
I have an army of soldiers
ready to raise hell.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.999
You see, Lady Annalisa...

01:45.800 --> 01:48.279
If we continued this war alongside you,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.839
we'd underestimate
Gennaro Savastano again.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.399
We can't make that mistake again.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.359
What are you saying, Don Ruggero?

02:01.280 --> 02:03.440
He's saying that this time
we're holding the wild card.

02:33.760 --> 02:36.839
This is the message of peace
we're sending Gennaro Savastano.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.959
You don't know how much
this peace will cost you.

02:40.080 --> 02:42.639
This peace has no price, Lady Annalisa.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.720
Now I'm supposed to be scared of you?

03:05.160 --> 03:07.599
You can go wherever you want,

03:07.720 --> 03:10.959
but you'll still be a poor little orphan

03:11.080 --> 03:13.759
who needs someone
to get orders from.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.079
First Don Pietro, then Scianel,

03:17.000 --> 03:18.999
now Gennaro Savastano.

03:19.520 --> 03:21.719
But mark my words,

03:21.840 --> 03:23.999
for me you were more than a sister.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.479
For a man you'll just be a poor female
only good for a fuck.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.439
Don't forget that.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.199
Your Lello was just a fool

03:38.760 --> 03:41.039
and Marinella was
an even bigger fool than him,

03:42.400 --> 03:44.879
because she didn't have the brains
to screw him.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.119
You know who gave Don Pietro
the idea to kill him?

03:51.080 --> 03:54.039
Who convinced
that poor creature Marinella?

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
Me.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.279
It's not true.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.159
Me, Lady Annalisa.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.999
From when I used
to alter your dress with pins

04:14.120 --> 04:16.039
I've wanted to tear your face off!

04:22.960 --> 04:24.839
You taught me that.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.519
Hyenas...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.719
remember?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.639
The Wizard wants peace.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.239
- Good.
- Good how?

05:36.600 --> 05:38.439
Now we gotta kill 'em all.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.479
The Wizard, the Capaccio brothers...
I want to see them dead!

05:41.600 --> 05:43.319
And we need to hurry.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.239
I thought I killed Pietro Savastano.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.919
It's like he's standing
in front of me again.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.199
You didn't do all this
to get your family back.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.559
You did it because you want
to be bigger than your father

06:11.720 --> 06:13.919
and if you win this war, you will be.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.479
No one from Secondigliano
has ever taken Central Naples.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.079
No one.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.799
Just you and me, Ciro,
and we're this close.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.199
But you keep talking only about me,

06:49.240 --> 06:51.439
whereas I've always talked about us.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.959
You don't need to think about me.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.759
Think about yourself,

07:01.800 --> 07:03.879
about your family, about Azzurra.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.919
I don't even have the guts
to visit their graves.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.919
Negotiate with the Confederates,

07:15.920 --> 07:17.879
accept the peace.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.599
They're on their knees,
and can't say no.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.839
Take it from me.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.439
If you do that,

07:27.280 --> 07:28.839
you win.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.719
And without bloodshed.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.119
Gennaro...

07:53.440 --> 07:56.279
The only Pietro Savastano
you need to think about

07:58.600 --> 08:01.199
is that little boy
waiting for you at home.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.319
Sweetheart!

09:02.080 --> 09:03.439
What's wrong?

09:05.520 --> 09:08.559
When they took Pietro
I nearly lost my mind.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.719
- I know.
- No, you don't know.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.439
When they took me to the place for the
handover, you know what I thought?

09:19.200 --> 09:23.559
That if we make it, if we get out alive,
we need to leave.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.879
You need to stop.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.399
You hear me, Gennaro?
You need to stop.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.039
If you don't do it now,

09:37.640 --> 09:39.879
I'll leave you.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.319
Good morning, Don Ruggero.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.119
On whose behalf are you here today?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.799
My conscience sent me.

10:38.920 --> 10:42.719
Conscience is a priest's concern
and I don't see concern in your eyes.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.679
But you do have a conscience.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.359
You know that good and evil
are in our hands.

10:53.960 --> 10:56.759
Gennaro and me
want to patch things up.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.559
Patching things up is what I want too.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.279
- Hi, Ciro.
- Hi, guys.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.719
They'll take the Capaccios
out of your way.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.239
Forcella goes back
to having one boss, you.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.159
You negotiate peace in my name
and you don't tell me?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.399
Forcella is what you've always wanted.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.839
That was always the deal, wasn't it?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.679
And what did Gennaro
get out of the deal?

12:45.480 --> 12:46.480
Ciro...

12:48.360 --> 12:50.319
You and me are brothers.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.559
We've lost blood together.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.599
Valerio's question needs an answer.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.880
Forcella's not enough for me anymore.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.439
For my sister,

13:03.560 --> 13:06.039
for what happened
and for what we did.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.160
We gotta shove the Wizard
and the Capaccios in the shitter.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.199
Whaddaya wanna do? Kill 'em all?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.719
I want what's right.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.239
What's right...

13:25.400 --> 13:26.919
What's right?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.959
I want everything
that was the Charmer's.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.839
That means you and us will split up
the Charmer's turf.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.559
I'll speak to the Wizard and Gennaro.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.999
We'll speak to them together.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.759
I'm done here.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.279
Ciro...

14:06.280 --> 14:08.159
You and me are still brothers...

14:31.320 --> 14:33.839
You noticed too. I could tell.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.759
He said, you and us.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.919
Today, Ciro made it clear
that he puts Gennaro before us.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.799
But I'm not jealous.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.639
I know that Genny and Ciro are friends.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.559
Besides, for me,
an ally's brother is my brother.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.999
Is this any way to be a brother?

15:00.360 --> 15:03.439
If we hadn't asked him for anything,
what would have happened?

15:03.560 --> 15:07.159
Gennaro Savastano
would have kept the Charmer's areas.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.399
And then, what would he do tomorrow?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.359
He'll take everything that's ours.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.959
Today we're allies

15:31.600 --> 15:33.799
and this alliance gives us strength.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.159
But tomorrow, if anything happens,

15:38.920 --> 15:40.639
I'll cut Gennaro into pieces.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.719
I think that tomorrow
has already arrived.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.919
They're just thoughts, Valerio.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.199
See that? They scored a goal!

16:23.720 --> 16:26.319
Uncle Ciro's here. Let's go say hello.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.079
Let's go.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.519
- See?
- Pietro!

16:36.640 --> 16:38.759
See how beautiful he is?

16:41.080 --> 16:42.799
We're doing it today.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.839
- Wanna give him a little kiss?
- He's so beautiful!

16:52.080 --> 16:55.079
Look what I'm going to do...
One, two, three!

16:58.320 --> 16:59.799
You're so beautiful!

17:06.079 --> 17:07.919
The Capaccios gotta do it too.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.999
Everybody's gotta put up
a close relative as collateral.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.598
That will keep us all calm.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.878
- But I'm afraid.
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.359
They want peace more than we do.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.559
I'm not afraid of what I have to do.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.719
I'm afraid that after this,
we won't be the same as before.

17:40.240 --> 17:44.079
Damn straight, we won't be the same,
we'll be much better.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.359
You came back to life?

18:12.480 --> 18:15.079
No, I'm a fuckin' ghost. Get on.

18:16.920 --> 18:20.079
- I'm supposed to get on this thing?
- It'll make you a kid again.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.999
You know how to ride it?

18:24.120 --> 18:26.039
Come on, I'll take you flying.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.319
What's gonna happen
at today's meeting?

19:20.440 --> 19:23.919
Thanks to you,
we're letting monkeys in our house.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.799
The deal they're offering
is inconceivable.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.759
The Wizard knows it,

19:31.880 --> 19:35.199
and this farce is the price to pay
for getting out of this war.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.879
But what's the price we have to pay?

19:39.200 --> 19:43.639
Tomorrow Gennaro gets everything
he always wanted, just for him.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.679
The Charmer's turf.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.359
And then, in his head, everything else.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.319
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.239
For now, me and my brother
are keeping our heads down,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.439
just like you are.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.999
But we still have
another card up our sleeve.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.519
You wanna play it?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.199
Where were you? They're waiting.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.999
I have something to tell you.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.880
Something that will change my mind?

21:50.280 --> 21:51.719
Shall we get started?

21:54.520 --> 21:57.199
We've come together to shake hands

21:57.840 --> 21:59.959
and I want to shake everyone's hand.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.439
But I want to say something to you
personally.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.079
You've made a huge mess, boys.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.359
The shootings, the bashings...

22:16.280 --> 22:17.719
the dead.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.439
If you go on like this, in the System,

22:21.560 --> 22:23.319
you won't even make it to September.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.239
Nobody lives like this
if they're not forced to.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.639
We gotta go on for all the dead

22:34.160 --> 22:36.199
we're grieving.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.479
Forcella's got to be
the Villas' exclusively.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.919
No one must touch it anymore.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.479
While the Charmer's business and turf

23:00.600 --> 23:04.639
will be divided up equally
between the Villas and Savastano.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.119
In exchange, Gennaro Savastano
agrees to sell us coke

23:12.240 --> 23:14.519
at a fixed price that's the same
for everybody.

23:15.320 --> 23:19.479
And each of us agrees
to sell it at set prices.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.399
There won't be competition between us.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.999
Nor any more bloodshed.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.079
The respect that
each of us demands and deserves

23:34.320 --> 23:37.679
is due to everyone who's here today.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.479
We're not allies.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.119
We're definitely not.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.359
But we all belong to the same System.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.559
And it's in the name of this System
that we'll respect each other,

23:56.440 --> 23:58.519
above all else.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.839
You hear the old geezer?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.679
He wanted
to teach us about the System.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.399
Us, who turned the System
upside down!

24:25.520 --> 24:27.919
The main thing is
that we've put them all face down.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.639
Now we need to celebrate,
do something over the top.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.600
If it's OK with you,
I'll take care of it.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.440
All right.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.439
I'll show you this city
like you've never seen it.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.799
- All good?
- Yeah, don't worry.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.119
How did it end up?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.719
The guys from Forcella?

25:17.040 --> 25:19.559
Now we're in the hands
of Little Lord Valerio.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.839
Good.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.079
It all went well.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.080
How do I look?

27:34.440 --> 27:35.559
Do you really have to go?

27:39.960 --> 27:41.519
They'd be offended.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.919
They didn't want this peace.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.279
Can't you send someone else
and say you can't go?

27:57.920 --> 28:00.439
Azzurra, this peace is precious.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.399
Delicate and very precious.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.279
Well, don't stay out too late.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.200
Good evening, Don Ruggero.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.079
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.039
I'm mortified, but we've got something
important to tell you.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.959
What is it?

30:47.480 --> 30:48.920
Something very serious has happened.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.559
What happened?

30:56.280 --> 30:57.800
They killed the Wizard
in his own home.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.239
Guys!

32:32.360 --> 32:33.799
Evening, guys.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.119
Help them aboard.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.240
Come with us, guys.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.959
Cheers!

33:07.200 --> 33:08.639
Hi, Ciro.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.879
- Guys...
- Ciro.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.839
All good?

33:47.640 --> 33:49.839
Guys! Welcome!

33:52.560 --> 33:53.959
Come.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.519
I wanna show you something.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.319
The symbol of the brotherhood.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.360
It means we're all brothers
and we can't ever betray each other.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.559
- You want something to drink?
- Yes.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.319
Valerio?

34:29.880 --> 34:31.559
What's the matter?

34:37.920 --> 34:39.839
Aren't you pleased with how it went?

34:48.520 --> 34:50.279
You gotta forgive him.

34:50.400 --> 34:53.759
The fact I sat down with
my sister's killers drives him crazy.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.039
He didn't like it at all.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.399
People who want to play games
disgust him.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.799
He says that maybe with this peace
you wanted to screw us.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.559
- What the fuck are you saying?
- It's not your problem, Ciro.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.200
Are you serious?

35:26.200 --> 35:27.999
You picked the wrong ally.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.279
- What fucking ally?
- The Wizard.

35:33.120 --> 35:35.839
By now the Capaccio brothers
will have killed him.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.799
Those two idiots
poisoned your mind like this.

35:41.920 --> 35:45.039
It wasn't them.
You were too greedy.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.359
What were you thinking, Gennaro?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.799
With us and the Capaccios gone,
you'd eat up the Wizard in one bite

35:51.920 --> 35:54.319
and all Naples would be yours.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.839
Greedy?

35:58.120 --> 36:01.279
If I wanted to fuck you over,
I already would have, arsehole!

36:05.840 --> 36:07.679
You've always disgusted me.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.799
I only put up with you because of him.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.879
You and me are brothers,
right, Ciro?

36:14.120 --> 36:16.319
You and me aren't brothers, Enzo.

36:17.360 --> 36:19.599
We're two different breeds.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.039
I never had anyone in my life.

36:23.160 --> 36:25.879
You're something else, sons of kings,

36:26.960 --> 36:28.439
so you need to stick together.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.799
Cut it out.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.239
You didn't know shit
and I didn't allow you to.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.879
It was me.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.016
The Wizard
was gonna kill the Capaccios

36:43.040 --> 36:44.040
and I was gonna kill you.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.159
Ciro...

36:45.280 --> 36:46.280
It's not true.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.839
You're just saying that to protect him.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.599
You're exactly the same.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.919
You think that feelings
count more than business.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.519
Someone who's grown up alone like me
knows all too well

37:00.680 --> 37:03.639
that when it comes to business,
feelings don't count for shit.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.199
Stop it.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.199
Isn't Naples beautiful from here?

37:16.280 --> 37:17.639
Am I right?

37:20.960 --> 37:22.759
I've always dreamt about it.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.279
I always wanted this city all for myself.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.439
I didn't want to share it with anyone.

37:29.040 --> 37:32.079
I alone deserved it
because of everything I lost.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.279
And I would have done anything to get it.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.679
I killed Carmela.

37:44.800 --> 37:45.800
Ciro...

37:47.280 --> 37:48.799
Shut up.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.879
You would have stopped.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.319
I needed you to run.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.440
Is that true, Ciro?

38:20.040 --> 38:21.359
Shoot.

38:29.320 --> 38:31.319
Then you'll have to do it.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.759
I can't do this.
