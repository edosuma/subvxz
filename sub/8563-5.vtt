00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>March, 1944...</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>After four months of fierce
jungle combat,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>The marines of the 1st division</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Were withdrawn from
cape gloucester.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Veteran #1: We were absolutely certain
we were going to go back</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>To Melbourne to rest again.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
But no, we ended up on
an island called pavuvu.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Pavuvu, part of the Solomon
island chain,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Is just north of guadalcanal.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Once a thriving coconut
plantation,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>It was abandoned when the
war broke out.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
The guy that picked that out,
he sure didn't know what he was doing.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
It was the nastiest,
dirtiest looking place under the sun.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
All kinds of things
just grew in profusion,

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Especially the rat population.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
The land crabs would
come out at night

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
And you could hear them
clackity-clacking and clicking around.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
And they would get
into your shoes.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Veteran #5: A lot of
training started.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>And it seemed to get
heavier and heavier,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>So you knew we were gonna go
somewhere into combat.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>In late August, 1944,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>The 1st division shipped
out again</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Headed for a small coral island beten
Guam and the Philippines...</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Peleliu.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Only six miles long and
two miles wide,</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Peleliu held an airstrip</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>That was close to the
philippine islands.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>General Douglas macarthur decided</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>That the capture of that airstrip</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Was critical to retaking
the Philippines</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>As a stepping stone
to the invasion</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Of the Japanese mainland.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>The Navy bombarded peleliu
for three days</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>And the marines followed.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>The men were told that the fighting
would last only a few days.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>But the combat on peleliu</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Would last more than two months</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>And would become as deadly</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>As any island invasion
of world war ii.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Veteran #4: I don't think you could
train for anything like that.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>It started when we started in.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
And it didn't cease.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
It was... it was a nightmare.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>For you are about to be awarded
the medal of honor.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Selling U.S. War bonds
is just as important

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
As what you did on guadalcanal.
Now pack your seabag. You're going home.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Home?

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm enlisting tomorrow.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Eugene... - I don't need
your permission, father.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>"dear vera, we haven't seen a
jap for two weeks now.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>They got smart and got the hell out
of this godforsaken spot.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Now our enemy is the
jungle itself.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>The jungle and the rain."</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>Lebec!</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
All you need is a week or two.
That should do the trick.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>They got a hospital
over on banika.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
<i>I'm gonna pull some paper and you'll
be on your way in an hour.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Why am I in with guys who need to
have their razor blades taken away?

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Most of the guys that come
through here are simply...

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Tired.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
My guess is you fall
into that category.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey, you're a dead man,
you know it!

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
Go get Dr. Grant!

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
This isn't the right place for me.
I'm rested, I'm fit.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
I want to return to my
unit and my friends.

00:04.000 --> 00:04.000
I hope it's quick and
easy for you, leckie.

00:04.000 --> 02:42.051
No worries about
ending up like me.

<i>Big smile, miss Grey!</i>

02:57.936 --> 03:00.305
- How's that, fellas?
- You look beautiful, Virginia.

03:00.939 --> 03:03.040
When do we say, "back the attack"?

03:03.074 --> 03:05.209
Every chance you get!

03:05.243 --> 03:08.579
<i>Now the kiss on the cheek
and we gotta go!</i>

03:08.613 --> 03:10.914
Hold that!

03:10.949 --> 03:12.316
This is a shortcut.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.753
That's Virginia Grey.

03:16.955 --> 03:19.757
Hey, excuse me.
I don't believe this.

03:20.726 --> 03:24.228
You're John Basilone.

03:24.263 --> 03:26.263
I'm gonna be in the marine corps.

03:26.298 --> 03:28.399
It's a fine branch
of our armed forces.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.536
I re... report next Tuesday.

03:32.939 --> 03:34.740
Boot camp's a breeze.

03:34.774 --> 03:38.210
You get to sleep in on mondays.

03:38.244 --> 03:39.444
What else?

03:39.479 --> 03:41.180
You coming?

03:41.214 --> 03:45.284
Uh, keep your head
down and keep moving.

03:45.318 --> 03:47.286
Look down, keep moving.

03:47.321 --> 03:49.422
Listen to your n.C.O.S.

03:49.457 --> 03:52.659
Thanks. What's an "n. C.O."?

04:10.145 --> 04:13.580
- You handle it well.
- Handle what well?

04:15.217 --> 04:18.519
Membership in the
famous people's club.

04:18.553 --> 04:23.423
Just don't be surprised if
it's not quite what you expect.

04:24.359 --> 04:26.093
Go on stage,

04:26.127 --> 04:28.863
Say "back the attack" a
couple hundred times,

04:28.897 --> 04:31.999
Get my picture took-
there's not much to it.

04:32.034 --> 04:34.602
You have no idea
what's coming at you.

04:36.572 --> 04:39.942
Better keep your head down.

04:47.283 --> 04:49.150
<i>What kind of message is that?</i>

04:49.185 --> 04:50.719
- Whoo.
- Wow.

04:50.753 --> 04:53.155
My kid brother comes to visit me.

04:53.189 --> 04:55.090
Am I allowed to even speak
to you without saluting,

04:55.124 --> 04:57.693
- Sergeant Basilone?
- Shut up, you jerk.

04:57.727 --> 04:59.695
You know I work for a living.

04:59.729 --> 05:01.262
Early morning, sergeant Basilone.

05:01.297 --> 05:03.431
'morning, al. Hey,
how did they let this palooka

05:03.465 --> 05:05.433
Into a classy joint
like the biltmore?

05:05.467 --> 05:07.035
This is my brother George, al.

05:07.069 --> 05:08.836
Can I get you some coffee,
sir? - Please.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.471
Hey, how about some breakfast?

05:10.505 --> 05:12.306
I got a train to catch at 0717.

05:12.341 --> 05:13.774
No no, al can swing it. Right, al?

05:13.809 --> 05:16.376
Breakfast? Absolutely.

05:16.411 --> 05:19.347
One of us has to go
back to the marines.

05:19.381 --> 05:21.382
Pendleton agreeing with you?

05:21.417 --> 05:23.351
Paradise by the sea.

05:23.386 --> 05:25.386
Virginia Grey agreeing with you?

05:25.421 --> 05:28.289
Hey, don't you be thinkin' about her.
She's in good hands.

05:28.324 --> 05:31.093
Yeah, but is she in
the best of hands?

05:31.127 --> 05:32.794
Sit down!

05:34.330 --> 05:35.865
Here we are, gentlemen.

05:35.899 --> 05:38.067
- Thanks, al.
- You're welcome.

05:42.739 --> 05:45.106
Giovanni, you're everywhere.

05:45.141 --> 05:47.208
Yeah, they keep me running.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.444
Listen to this: 0900 I got a
meeting with the governor,

05:50.478 --> 05:53.146
Then a rally at a
plant in glendale.

05:53.181 --> 05:56.083
Tonight some big deal at
the Hollywood canteen.

05:56.117 --> 05:58.885
I had a six-hour pass.
I go to the movies

05:58.920 --> 06:01.321
And who shows up in the newsreel?

06:01.355 --> 06:06.393
You, mom, pa, and most of new
Jersey at John Basilone day.

06:06.428 --> 06:09.230
That was crazy.

06:09.265 --> 06:12.267
Don't slug me,
but can I ask you a question?

06:12.301 --> 06:14.069
Take your chances.

06:16.206 --> 06:19.608
How scary was it... guadalcanal?

06:21.311 --> 06:24.146
I hope I don't freeze up
or make a mistake, is all.

06:24.181 --> 06:27.316
- I hope I can be as...
- George.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.852
Don't feel like you
need to prove nothin'.

06:29.886 --> 06:32.020
You know what I mean?

06:32.055 --> 06:34.355
- No, I...
- do you know what I mean?

06:37.192 --> 06:38.592
Yeah.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.094
Looks like Hawaii.

07:13.397 --> 07:14.964
No, it doesn't.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.401
Hey, sledge, leyden,
what are you doing?

07:18.435 --> 07:20.102
Looking at land, oswalt.

07:20.136 --> 07:23.471
<i>Man over p.A.: Attention, all hands,
make way to debark station.</i>

07:23.506 --> 07:27.876
<i>Make all preparations to offload
personnel and cargo.</i>

07:29.379 --> 07:32.580
<i>Here we go. Get your
gear squared away.</i>

07:32.615 --> 07:35.082
<i>Look at the new guys.</i>

07:43.891 --> 07:45.992
Lookin' for how company.

07:50.030 --> 07:52.765
- This how company?
- Two in.

07:52.799 --> 07:54.933
No.

07:54.968 --> 07:58.537
<i>Damn.</i>

07:58.571 --> 08:02.074
I could have told you.
I fuckin' warned you, you fuck.

08:02.108 --> 08:05.677
What? Huh? Yeah.

08:05.712 --> 08:09.114
Take that, you fuckin' jap!

08:12.018 --> 08:15.020
And recover.

08:29.669 --> 08:31.637
Hello.

08:33.907 --> 08:35.974
<i>This "k" company?</i>

08:36.008 --> 08:38.844
We're supposed to be in 60 mortars,
second squad.

08:40.179 --> 08:43.515
Jesus, these guys are
supposed to be 60 mortars.

08:43.549 --> 08:45.317
This is second squad.

08:45.351 --> 08:48.420
- Robert oswalt.
- Eugene sledge.

08:48.454 --> 08:50.723
You mortars too?

08:50.757 --> 08:53.825
Riflemen, third platoon.
Bill leyden.

08:53.860 --> 08:57.262
Then we'll ignore you.

08:57.296 --> 09:00.499
That's snafu.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.535
<i>That man's de l'eau and I'm
corporal burgin.</i>

09:03.570 --> 09:06.905
Find yourself a bunk.

09:12.579 --> 09:14.013
Taken.

09:19.419 --> 09:20.719
Taken.

09:24.524 --> 09:26.658
Come on, I'll show you around,

09:26.693 --> 09:28.927
Find you another tent.

09:39.838 --> 09:41.906
Let's go.

09:44.276 --> 09:47.379
This is where they dry-dock us
when we're not killing japs.

09:47.413 --> 09:50.449
<i>- Over there is chow...
- Man: Move it!</i>

09:50.483 --> 09:53.085
...Heads,

09:53.120 --> 09:56.022
King company skipper,
Captain haldane.

09:56.056 --> 09:57.824
<i>Everybody calls him ack ack.</i>

09:57.859 --> 10:00.661
<i>- What's your name?
- De l'eau.</i>

10:00.695 --> 10:02.896
D-e...

10:02.931 --> 10:07.367
L'e-a-u, de l'eau.

10:07.401 --> 10:09.035
Jay de l'eau.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.138
Were you in guadalcanal?

10:11.172 --> 10:15.208
Gloucester. G-l...

10:15.243 --> 10:17.744
Grab a rack in that
second tent over there.

10:17.779 --> 10:19.713
Thanks.

10:19.747 --> 10:21.748
<i>Sure thing.</i>

10:23.684 --> 10:28.222
Oh, you know where I
could find how company?

10:28.256 --> 10:30.091
1st marines?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.661
Somewhere over there.

10:37.901 --> 10:39.869
- Wanna get some chow?
- Been waiting for it.

10:46.009 --> 10:48.044
<i>- Ho ho ho.
- Runner: We know this guy?</i>

10:48.078 --> 10:50.046
Mug's ugly enough
to ring a few bells.

10:50.081 --> 10:51.715
Gloucester,
maybe? Was it gloucester?

10:51.749 --> 10:53.483
<i>- Chuckler: Was it gloucester?
- Was he on gloucester?</i>

10:53.518 --> 10:55.385
- He may have been on gloucester.
- He looks familiar.

10:55.419 --> 10:56.886
Maybe he was on gloucester.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.588
<i>- I don't know. He's ugly.
- Fuck you all.</i>

10:58.622 --> 11:00.657
Looks like a land crab that
once crawled up my pee hole.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.961
Hey, welcome home, cobber.

11:09.032 --> 11:12.168
You have a good vacation?

11:12.202 --> 11:15.338
Anything to get away
from you bastards.

11:15.373 --> 11:16.907
We're not so lucky.

11:16.941 --> 11:18.575
Oh, jeez!

11:18.610 --> 11:21.311
Ho, there you go.

11:21.346 --> 11:22.980
What's in this?

11:23.014 --> 11:26.049
When it tastes this bad,
it's hard to tell.

11:27.318 --> 11:28.918
What you got?

11:28.953 --> 11:31.388
Pens. Tell Santa whether
you been naughty or nice.

11:31.423 --> 11:33.290
Naughty. The naughtiest.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.160
- It's June.
- It's the South pacific.

11:36.194 --> 11:38.696
Christmas comes in June.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.732
For hoosier...

11:40.766 --> 11:43.101
<i>'cause he's always saying his prayers,
making his bed.</i>

11:43.135 --> 11:44.436
- Aw!
- All: Awww!

11:44.470 --> 11:46.404
- Look at that.
- That's beautiful.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.206
<i>- Chuckler?
- Yes?</i>

11:48.240 --> 11:50.675
<i>- Thank you.
- Heavier reading.</i>

11:50.710 --> 11:52.577
- With pictures.
- Here you go.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.246
<i>Something for runner's stocking.</i>

11:54.280 --> 11:56.214
Oh, I read this already.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.799
I don't believe it.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.074
Oh!

12:22.109 --> 12:24.076
Something's wrong.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.679
Something's very wrong if you
made it through boot camp.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.314
Give me a break, you old greaser!

12:28.348 --> 12:31.217
Get up off my deck.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.152
- Captain haldane.
- Sir.

12:33.187 --> 12:36.455
What's this about, marine?
Some rite of greeting new to the corps?

12:36.489 --> 12:39.024
Yes, sir. Um, I mean, no, sir.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.127
- Who are you?
- Private Eugene sledge, sir.

12:42.162 --> 12:45.397
<i>You fellas know each other or is this
some kind of conflict resolution?</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:47.867
Old friends, sir.
Mobile, Alabama, sir.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.269
- Mobile?
- Yes, sir.

12:50.304 --> 12:53.973
- Old friends, huh?
- That explains it.

12:54.008 --> 12:55.709
As you were.

12:55.743 --> 12:58.545
But try not to dislocate a
shoulder or break an arm.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.014
We need both you men healthy.

13:00.048 --> 13:01.215
- Sir.
- Sir.

13:01.249 --> 13:02.816
Carry on.

13:12.862 --> 13:14.929
Get me in hot water
on the first day.

13:14.963 --> 13:17.365
Yeah, well, you deserve it!

13:19.601 --> 13:21.436
Welcome to paradise.

13:23.172 --> 13:25.440
<i>How do you get used to the
smell around here?</i>

13:25.475 --> 13:27.209
Think this shitheap stinks now,

13:27.243 --> 13:29.378
You should have seen it
when we first got here.

13:29.413 --> 13:32.949
It was wall-to-wall rats,
crabs and rotten coconuts.

13:32.983 --> 13:35.585
Thank God I'm rotating home.

13:35.619 --> 13:38.455
I can't believe I finally
get here and you go home.

13:38.489 --> 13:40.190
When you leavin'?

13:40.224 --> 13:42.226
When the marine corps tells me.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.828
- What's your unit?
- K-3-5.

13:44.862 --> 13:47.930
<i>A mortarman, just like you.</i>

13:47.965 --> 13:49.899
Whoo-hoo!

13:52.135 --> 13:55.170
Hallelujah.

13:55.205 --> 13:57.705
The health of the corps

13:57.740 --> 13:59.974
Is only as strong

14:00.009 --> 14:04.245
As the health of the
individual marine.

14:04.280 --> 14:09.151
Marines will make every effort
to keep themselves clean.

14:09.185 --> 14:11.020
- Hey!
- Ahh!

14:11.054 --> 14:13.322
Hey, don't you quit on me, fucker!

14:13.357 --> 14:15.658
- You gotta be kidding!
- Not till I've rinsed.

14:15.693 --> 14:18.095
<i>They get hot chow to you
when they can.</i>

14:18.129 --> 14:20.531
You know, it might
only be crud like this,

14:20.566 --> 14:23.168
But when you been on
the line taking fire,

14:23.202 --> 14:25.470
Hot chow is a miracle.

14:26.973 --> 14:30.508
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- What is that, baby food?

14:33.212 --> 14:35.447
You know, you laugh... you laugh,

14:35.481 --> 14:37.616
But that might be worth its
weight in gold someday.

14:37.650 --> 14:40.485
You get hungry enough,
somebody'll want to trade for it.

14:42.188 --> 14:45.992
You do not trade this... Ever.

14:47.661 --> 14:50.496
.45 will stop a jap better
than a clip of your carbine.

14:50.530 --> 14:53.132
You hit one of the suckers
in the hand with that,

14:53.167 --> 14:55.268
Heh, take his arm right off.

14:55.302 --> 14:58.138
You can write your father a
nice thank-you note for that.

14:58.172 --> 15:01.775
Working party... three of
you boots go with snafu.

15:01.809 --> 15:02.943
Hurry up!

15:02.978 --> 15:06.514
You heard the sergeant... Now!

15:06.548 --> 15:09.083
You don't mind, do you, leyden?

15:09.118 --> 15:12.754
You assholes are gonna miss cleaning
out oil barrels pretty soon.

15:14.189 --> 15:16.925
You're gonna be humping
up some fucking hill...

15:19.295 --> 15:21.363
Or across a beach,

15:21.398 --> 15:23.799
Japs pouring shit for fire,

15:23.833 --> 15:26.835
Pissing your pants,
crying "boo hoo,"

15:26.870 --> 15:29.638
And wishing you were back
here with nothing asked of you

15:29.672 --> 15:31.573
But to scrub oil out of drums.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.343
Why don't you grab a brush

15:36.378 --> 15:37.744
And give us a hand?

15:37.779 --> 15:40.714
Fuck that shit.
I scrub drums for no man.

15:40.748 --> 15:42.649
Can we take a break?

15:42.684 --> 15:45.552
Do whatever you want.
This ain't my detail.

15:45.587 --> 15:50.057
I was supposed to dump you all off here,
then report back to the c.P.

15:50.092 --> 15:52.093
Then why are you still here?

15:52.127 --> 15:56.230
I like to watch the
new guys sweat.

16:13.749 --> 16:16.684
Ahh! Are those the
most butt-ugly creatures

16:16.719 --> 16:19.787
You ever saw before in your life?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.863
Jesus, sid.

16:30.967 --> 16:33.869
When you start pulling them out
of your hooch in the morning,

16:33.903 --> 16:36.606
You won't feel so tenderhearted.

16:59.528 --> 17:02.530
Lost mine in the polk.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.866
Or somebody took it. Maybe one of
the swabbies wanted a souvenir.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.301
Yeah?

17:07.336 --> 17:10.371
Some of the guys think
they're good luck.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.574
I don't know.
You can have this one.

17:13.608 --> 17:16.210
I got a couple.

17:17.679 --> 17:19.646
Here.

17:19.681 --> 17:22.049
- Thank you.
- Sure.

17:29.691 --> 17:32.026
Sid?

17:33.729 --> 17:35.497
What's it like?

17:43.107 --> 17:45.508
I slept with a woman in Melbourne.

17:45.543 --> 17:47.344
I'm not bragging.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.783
But that's at one end, right?

17:52.818 --> 17:57.055
And then way down there
as far as you can go...

17:59.158 --> 18:02.995
And that's what it's like.

18:03.029 --> 18:05.597
And that...

18:05.631 --> 18:08.166
That you could never imagine.

18:13.771 --> 18:15.539
Okay.

18:20.444 --> 18:23.045
I'm gonna miss you, sid.

18:31.087 --> 18:33.221
You'll be all right.

18:58.115 --> 19:00.916
<i>Woman in movie: Are you
angry about mething?</i>

19:00.984 --> 19:03.986
<i>Man in movie: Of course no</i>

19:04.020 --> 19:06.422
<i>I'm glad.</i>

19:06.456 --> 19:08.690
I won't cry.

19:11.394 --> 19:13.829
Dear Christ in heaven,
would you look at her?

19:13.863 --> 19:17.999
<i>I don't know how to kiss
or I would kiss you.</i>

19:20.537 --> 19:22.805
Where do the noses go?

19:28.278 --> 19:31.214
<i>There we go!</i>

19:31.248 --> 19:34.083
What are you waiting for?
Fuck her.

19:34.118 --> 19:36.419
Think she's blonde down there?

19:46.163 --> 19:48.531
<i>Look, pilar!</i>

19:48.565 --> 19:51.000
<i>Roberto fell in the brook.</i>

20:04.550 --> 20:06.851
<i>Cease fire! Re!</i>

20:06.886 --> 20:09.887
Cease fire on the firing line!

20:11.991 --> 20:16.561
You stupid, goddamn
shavetail son of a bitch!

20:19.798 --> 20:22.400
You keep your fucking
weapon pointed downrange

20:22.435 --> 20:27.039
Or I will shove that fuckin'
piece up your sorry fucking ass.

20:27.073 --> 20:29.641
Don't look at me, lieutenant.
The gunny's right.

20:31.344 --> 20:33.378
<i>Next relay!</i>

20:59.740 --> 21:02.208
You seen Phillips?

21:05.278 --> 21:07.446
I believe the angels
are shipping out.

21:07.481 --> 21:10.750
You might catch them
back down at the docks.

21:32.473 --> 21:35.041
Sid was my best customer.

21:35.075 --> 21:37.644
When you've finished,
please return it

21:37.678 --> 21:40.113
To the pacific
library of congress.

21:42.483 --> 21:45.619
Kipling. Always good.

21:45.653 --> 21:48.689
Most of these jokers can't read.

21:50.391 --> 21:52.426
<i>Have you heard the latest
about the other war?</i>

21:52.460 --> 21:53.827
There's another war?

21:53.862 --> 21:57.164
We invaded Europe.
Landed last month in France.

21:57.198 --> 22:00.233
Hell, unless you got a brother over there,
most guys don't give a shit.

22:00.268 --> 22:02.769
My brother landed in Italy,

22:02.803 --> 22:05.906
<i>Tank battalion.</i>

22:05.940 --> 22:08.208
Well, I guess you
get to give a shit.

22:12.213 --> 22:14.581
Just coffee, thanks.

22:30.198 --> 22:33.634
That explains it.
You're a believer.

22:33.669 --> 22:35.937
Yes.

22:38.073 --> 22:40.175
Okay, question:

22:40.209 --> 22:41.943
God created everything, right?

22:41.977 --> 22:46.013
The heavens, the seven seas,
the marine corps...

22:46.047 --> 22:47.847
<i>Sleeping beauty there...</i>

22:47.882 --> 22:49.415
Even him.

22:49.449 --> 22:52.216
...Land crabs, rats, mosquitoes.

22:52.251 --> 22:54.318
The mosquitoes are a little tough
to understand, I guess, but...

22:54.352 --> 22:57.287
God created japs too, right...

22:57.321 --> 23:01.256
Yellow slants who have tried
to kill me on many occasions?

23:01.290 --> 23:03.791
Japs come from the
garden of eden too?

23:05.894 --> 23:07.862
Well, what we do is up to us.

23:07.896 --> 23:10.865
<i>He gives the choice.</i>

23:10.899 --> 23:14.101
Free will. Right.

23:14.135 --> 23:18.238
Except he's God, of course, so he knows
what we're gonna do before we do it.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.674
Predestination.

23:23.277 --> 23:26.078
So the whole game is fixed by
the will of gramps on his throne

23:26.113 --> 23:27.880
While we're down here for what?

23:27.914 --> 23:31.316
His entertainment? That makes
us chumps and God's a sadist.

23:31.351 --> 23:35.553
And either way I
got no use for him.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.722
So what do you believe in?

23:37.757 --> 23:39.691
I believe in ammunition.

23:39.725 --> 23:42.860
<i>Tell you what, though.</i>

23:42.895 --> 23:45.529
Since I'm not on speaking
terms with him anymore,

23:45.563 --> 23:48.132
Next time you're having a
chat with the old geezer,

23:48.166 --> 23:50.534
Can you ask him to sink
a few jap transports

23:50.569 --> 23:52.502
And have them all
fall on their bayonets

23:52.537 --> 23:55.938
So I can get the fuck
out of here and go home?

23:55.973 --> 23:59.140
I sure would appreciate it.

24:04.278 --> 24:06.480
You go ahead and keep it.

24:06.514 --> 24:09.515
I don't know why I have
it in the first place.

24:09.550 --> 24:11.117
No, thanks.

24:13.921 --> 24:16.789
I've got my own.

24:44.247 --> 24:46.582
Follow the man in front of you

24:46.617 --> 24:48.584
And get off that beach.

24:48.619 --> 24:52.355
<i>And when you get to the tree line,
remember to clear your weapons of sand.</i>

24:52.389 --> 24:53.757
<i>- Aye, sir.
- Mortarmen...</i>

24:53.791 --> 24:55.325
- Here you go, marine.
- Thank you, sir.

24:55.359 --> 24:57.727
<i>...Make sure you have four h.
E. Rounds set for fire.</i>

24:57.762 --> 25:00.797
Good luck. God bless.

25:00.831 --> 25:04.034
<i>You heard the skipper!
Get your gear on. Move!</i>

25:07.004 --> 25:09.606
<i>How's my pack?</i>

25:09.640 --> 25:14.243
Let's get it done, Eugene.

25:14.277 --> 25:17.113
<i>Second squad, fourth boat!</i>

25:20.316 --> 25:24.052
<i>Get inside! Easy easy!
Get inside.</i>

25:26.154 --> 25:27.922
<i>Section 1 and 2 loading.</i>

25:27.956 --> 25:29.957
- Good luck, sledge.
- Thank you, sir.

25:29.992 --> 25:32.493
Sergeant.

25:48.476 --> 25:51.045
I don't smoke.

25:51.079 --> 25:52.779
Yeah?

26:15.904 --> 26:17.272
Here we go, boys!

27:36.151 --> 27:38.752
Stay the fuck down!

27:40.689 --> 27:44.726
...My trespasses...

27:59.810 --> 28:02.645
Fire! Open fire!

28:06.050 --> 28:07.684
Load and lock, gentlemen!

28:07.718 --> 28:09.119
<i>Load and lock!</i>

28:09.153 --> 28:11.721
<i>Load and lock!</i>

28:42.151 --> 28:43.952
<i>Stand by, marines!</i>

28:54.730 --> 28:56.965
<i>Here we go! Let's go, let's go!</i>

28:56.999 --> 28:59.468
Move move move! Go go go!

28:59.502 --> 29:01.304
Move out!

29:06.410 --> 29:08.444
Let's move out!
Let's go! Move out!

29:08.478 --> 29:10.279
<i>Ahh!</i>

29:10.313 --> 29:12.081
Keep moving! Keep it moving!

29:12.115 --> 29:17.219
<i>Go go go!</i>

29:17.254 --> 29:20.089
<i>Keep moving!</i>

29:23.560 --> 29:25.661
<i>Sledge, get on the beach!
Let's make a move!</i>

29:25.695 --> 29:28.030
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

29:28.064 --> 29:30.465
<i>Marines, move it!</i>

29:38.475 --> 29:39.842
<i>I'm hit!</i>

29:39.876 --> 29:42.010
<i>I'm hit!</i>

29:42.044 --> 29:45.581
<i>I'm bleeding out!
I'm bleeding out!</i>

29:45.615 --> 29:48.417
<i>I'm bleeding out! Help!</i>

29:59.030 --> 30:01.599
Let's go! Open fire!

30:07.740 --> 30:10.375
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

30:10.409 --> 30:12.511
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

30:29.663 --> 30:31.830
Get up, get up, get up!

30:31.865 --> 30:33.599
Ahh!

30:42.776 --> 30:44.776
Corpsman!

30:45.778 --> 30:48.246
Marine! Let's go this way!

30:49.148 --> 30:52.117
Ahh!

31:10.580 --> 31:13.015
<i>Hold the mortars down!
Hold the mortars!</i>

31:36.421 --> 31:37.955
Easy on the water.
Easy on the water

31:37.989 --> 31:40.490
Where the hell is love company?

31:40.524 --> 31:42.625
- Is this 3/7?
- No, 3/5!

31:42.659 --> 31:44.760
Well, where the hell
is the 7th marines?

31:44.795 --> 31:49.698
You're on orange beach 3!
3/7's supposed to be on our right flank.

31:49.732 --> 31:53.268
Goddamn cocksucking
son of a bitch.

32:05.747 --> 32:08.215
Ahh!

32:24.499 --> 32:28.235
Sledge! Sledge, you gotta...

32:31.740 --> 32:34.041
They got us bracketed.
We gotta move!

32:34.075 --> 32:36.310
Let's go! Get your
ass out of this hole!

32:36.344 --> 32:38.812
We gotta move!

32:40.549 --> 32:42.883
Move! Get up there!

32:45.388 --> 32:47.691
<i>Let's go!</i>

32:57.199 --> 33:00.935
Sledge, God damn it, you gotta get
your ass out of that hole right now!

33:00.969 --> 33:04.338
<i>Move it! Move forward.
Join your squad!</i>

33:04.372 --> 33:06.206
Move!

33:08.877 --> 33:11.145
<i>Move move!</i>

33:12.881 --> 33:15.183
<i>Keep your heads down!</i>

33:18.420 --> 33:19.954
Aw, fuck!

33:23.692 --> 33:25.926
We gotta get off the beach!
I know!

33:25.961 --> 33:29.696
- Leckie, you gotta move!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

33:37.436 --> 33:40.705
<i>I'm fucking bleeding out!</i>

33:54.151 --> 33:56.719
Keep 'em here, gunny.
I gotta find second platoon.

33:56.754 --> 33:59.121
- Aye aye, sir.
- Hillbilly!

33:59.156 --> 34:01.857
You're with me.
Bring a runner. Let's go!

34:01.892 --> 34:03.993
You, let's go!

34:11.967 --> 34:16.036
- "k" company?
- Part of it.

34:16.071 --> 34:18.005
You're supposed to hook up
with the rest of the battalion

34:18.040 --> 34:20.775
In the Southern edge of the airfield,
in the brushline.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.977
Got it.

34:23.011 --> 34:24.945
You guys got any water?

34:24.979 --> 34:27.013
No, we ain't got
any fucking water.

34:27.048 --> 34:28.749
Southern edge of the airfield.

34:28.783 --> 34:31.518
Everybody take another salt pill.

34:32.953 --> 34:34.922
Gunny, bring them up here.

34:34.956 --> 34:36.490
Do it later! We gotta move!

34:36.524 --> 34:38.359
Let's go!

34:43.633 --> 34:46.700
- Keep moving!
- Ahh!

34:52.172 --> 34:54.872
<i>Let's go!</i>

34:59.078 --> 35:00.913
<i>Covering fire!</i>

35:05.351 --> 35:08.219
<i>Shift left!</i>

35:15.826 --> 35:18.929
- Ahh!
- Oh, fuck!

35:18.964 --> 35:21.332
<i>Keep the fire on them!</i>

35:34.581 --> 35:37.885
Oh, bill. Bill.

35:37.919 --> 35:40.088
Dropped my fucking weapon.

35:40.122 --> 35:43.357
Corpsman! Corpsman!

35:44.359 --> 35:46.192
Corpsman!

35:48.128 --> 35:50.495
Corpsman!

35:51.764 --> 35:53.997
Hey, everything's
gonna be fine. Bill!

35:54.032 --> 35:56.865
It ain't shit.
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:59.001 --> 36:00.835
It ain't shit.

36:04.105 --> 36:07.106
Damn it! Corpsman!

36:08.241 --> 36:11.378
There you are, God damn it!

36:11.412 --> 36:13.113
Pressure! Pressure!

36:15.349 --> 36:17.049
- Sorry.
- What?

36:22.487 --> 36:25.421
<i>Bill? - Corpsman:
Help me carry him back.</i>

36:25.455 --> 36:27.655
Bill?

36:29.424 --> 36:32.826
Bill?

36:32.860 --> 36:35.561
Bill?

36:55.346 --> 36:57.780
Son of a bitch.
Those are jap tanks.

36:59.616 --> 37:03.385
Mortars! Get me some h.E.
On those sons of bitches!

37:05.788 --> 37:08.221
- Now! Let's go, let's go.
- You heard the lieutenant.

37:08.255 --> 37:10.422
Let's go! Move out!

37:15.596 --> 37:18.966
Hold here, hold here!

37:20.602 --> 37:22.169
250... three rounds, h.E.!

37:22.203 --> 37:24.437
<i>250... three rounds, h.E.!</i>

37:32.613 --> 37:34.280
Hot load!

37:35.282 --> 37:37.916
- Hanging!
- Snafu: Fire!

37:39.619 --> 37:41.586
- Hanging!
- Fire!

37:44.624 --> 37:46.124
Drop 2-5.

37:51.729 --> 37:53.295
- Hanging!
- Fire!

37:54.530 --> 37:56.498
- Ahh!
- Hot load!

37:56.532 --> 37:58.633
- Hanging!
- Fire!

38:11.542 --> 38:13.642
- Hanging!
- Fire!

38:16.077 --> 38:18.209
Round's complete.

38:19.911 --> 38:22.311
Fall back 50 and dig in!

38:22.346 --> 38:25.612
<i>- Let's go!
- Oh, shit.</i>

38:25.647 --> 38:28.747
<i>- Shit!
- Fall back!</i>

38:42.389 --> 38:44.590
Fuck!

38:53.163 --> 38:56.465
<i>Spread out! Spread out!</i>

39:00.968 --> 39:04.235
Chuckler. Chuckler.

39:06.237 --> 39:08.236
You see chuckler or runner?

39:08.270 --> 39:10.004
Who?

39:10.038 --> 39:11.838
Juergins or conley? H-2-1?

39:11.872 --> 39:13.406
Never heard of them.

39:16.041 --> 39:19.441
<i>Lieutenant wants us up front.
Let's go!</i>

39:24.378 --> 39:26.145
Leckie! Leckie!

39:26.179 --> 39:27.912
Runner!

39:30.983 --> 39:33.783
- Are you okay?
- Thirsty.

39:40.152 --> 39:43.386
Hoosier got hit.

39:45.053 --> 39:46.619
<i>Keep moving, keep moving.</i>

39:46.654 --> 39:49.086
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

39:53.723 --> 39:55.657
You going asiatic?

39:57.426 --> 39:59.160
Feet are soaking wet.

40:02.196 --> 40:04.197
What you gonna do in
your stockin' feet

40:04.231 --> 40:07.299
When the fucking japs
bust through the line?

40:53.019 --> 40:57.221
Get back! Take cover!

41:03.492 --> 41:05.325
You men got enough ammo?

41:05.360 --> 41:07.393
<i>Sure thing, skipper.</i>

41:07.428 --> 41:10.861
Perimeter's 30yds
out from your hole.

41:10.896 --> 41:11.961
L.P.'s out beyond that.

41:11.995 --> 41:14.195
<i>The password's "lilliputian."</i>

41:14.230 --> 41:16.627
One man awake at all times.

41:19.762 --> 41:21.094
Lilliputian?

41:21.129 --> 41:24.196
Hard for the japs to say.

41:25.230 --> 41:27.663
Hard for me to say.

41:36.030 --> 41:38.131
Trade you.

41:48.872 --> 41:52.208
Shit, I forgot about that guy.

42:21.365 --> 42:24.168
We're rich, boys.

42:26.506 --> 42:29.173
Jap's got a shitload
of gold in his teeth.

42:30.308 --> 42:33.175
<i>Gold is what? Bucks an ounce?</i>

42:45.216 --> 42:48.918
Take the first watch.
Wake me up in four hours.

42:48.953 --> 42:51.454
Anything moves, kill it.

43:28.764 --> 43:31.298
Look at that.

43:36.302 --> 43:39.537
You ever been to the grand canyon?

43:39.572 --> 43:41.707
No.

43:41.741 --> 43:44.711
My dad went when he was a boy.

43:44.745 --> 43:48.117
He was always going on
about it when I was little.

43:48.151 --> 43:51.756
I'd ask him about it.
He said I had to see it to understand.

43:53.925 --> 43:56.427
<i>We got there late at night
to these cabins.</i>

43:56.461 --> 43:59.396
<i>Couldn't see a thing on
account of the dark.</i>

43:59.430 --> 44:01.598
<i>Next morning we got up,</i>

44:01.632 --> 44:03.899
Went outside...

44:03.933 --> 44:07.703
10yds from where we slept,
the fucking grand canyon.

44:07.737 --> 44:12.674
<i>A mile down, colors I'd
never seen before.</i>

44:12.708 --> 44:16.877
<i>My dad was right:
Pictures don't show it.</i>

44:18.513 --> 44:20.447
You have to be there

44:20.482 --> 44:22.483
Looking down into it.

44:24.587 --> 44:27.422
Shut the fuck up, you idiot.

44:32.831 --> 44:35.367
We have to go out there tomorrow.
