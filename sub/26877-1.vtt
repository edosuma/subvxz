WEBVTT

00:18.810 --> 00:20.812
[narrator in English]
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.650
But I'll be honest,
it doesn't have a happy ending.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.361
[grunting]

00:29.070 --> 00:31.990
In fact, it doesn't have
an ending at all.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.366
[grunts]

00:33.450 --> 00:34.325
[plastic tie zips]

00:35.243 --> 00:37.620
It's about how a bunch of institutions,

00:37.704 --> 00:39.372
some you're supposed to trust,

00:40.290 --> 00:42.333
got together and started a war.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.585
[tires squeal]

00:45.420 --> 00:47.630
Not the kind of war you're thinking of...

00:48.214 --> 00:51.551
the kind with tanks
and planes and parades and shit.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.845
I'm talking about a drug war.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.264
[grunting]

00:59.142 --> 01:00.935
The kind that's easy
to forget is happening...

01:01.728 --> 01:04.564
until you realize
in the last 30 years in Mexico

01:05.315 --> 01:06.733
it's killed half a million people...

01:08.318 --> 01:09.694
[panting]

01:09.778 --> 01:11.029
...and counting.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.244
Now, a lot of people
don't want to hear this story.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.915
They want to pretend it never happened.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.542
But fuck that.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.295
It happened.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.967
[horn honks]

01:38.681 --> 01:41.309
Look, I can't tell you
how the drug war ends.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.523
Man, I can't even tell you if it ends.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.778
But I can tell you how it began.

01:51.861 --> 01:52.862
[coughs]

01:52.946 --> 01:55.949
Or at least when we realized
we were in it.

01:58.993 --> 02:03.081
Sometimes you need somebody
to wake you the fuck up

02:03.164 --> 02:05.083
and tell you the shooting has started.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.960
[panting]

02:08.586 --> 02:10.296
[grunts]

02:10.421 --> 02:11.339
In this story...

02:13.133 --> 02:16.469
that guy's name is Kiki Camarena.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.847
[panting]

02:20.056 --> 02:22.725
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

03:50.230 --> 03:51.856
Do you smoke pot?

03:51.940 --> 03:55.902
I guess it's okay if you do.
There are laws now that say it's cool.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.615
I don't agree with them.
But it's not up to me.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.743
They say it's a gateway drug. And it is.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.828
It sure is in this story.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.540
If you smoked pot in the late '70s,
whether you know it or not,

04:09.624 --> 04:13.169
that pot probably started life
in the same place our story begins...

04:13.962 --> 04:15.255
Sinaloa.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.634
The third leg of what
they call the Mexican Golden Triangle,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.512
the birthplace of Mexican dope smuggling,

04:23.221 --> 04:25.056
and the guys who would go on
to run the game.

04:26.307 --> 04:32.188
With its fertile fields and hills heavy
with opium poppies and Mexican marijuana,

04:32.272 --> 04:36.109
to potheads and the Sinaloan scumbags
who operated there,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.611
it was a regular Garden of Eden.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.030
[Roberto Jordan's
"No se ha dado cuenta" playing]

05:15.231 --> 05:16.774
[man in Spanish]
Over there.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.077
How's it going? [laughs]

05:28.661 --> 05:31.289
How are things in the land of the future?
[laughs]

05:33.791 --> 05:38.546
Laugh now, but the future finds us all.
Even here in Sinaloa.

05:38.629 --> 05:43.217
Look, my newest student.
This is the real future, you'll see.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.803
Okay, princess. Is this ready to harvest?

05:47.972 --> 05:51.851
No. Too young. At least another week.

05:51.934 --> 05:52.977
What do you think?

05:56.856 --> 05:57.899
[man inhales]

05:58.733 --> 05:59.901
[exhales]

06:02.278 --> 06:03.112
She's right.

06:03.821 --> 06:09.452
He was my student, but would you believe,
now he plays with weeds in greenhouses.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.996
You're like a florist. [chuckles]

06:12.080 --> 06:14.040
[woman]
Hey, you're gonna be late!

06:14.123 --> 06:16.626
-Go on.
-Go on, Princess.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.880
-You guys heard her.
-Come on.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.383
-Yes, sir.
-One more week before picking.

06:26.469 --> 06:30.848
And what are you doing around here?
Did you come out for some fresh air?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.810
The new batch needs to breathe.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.062
Hoping to borrow an exhaust fan.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.272
[dogs barking]

06:38.356 --> 06:41.275
[vehicle approaching]

06:45.321 --> 06:46.614
Go, Rafa!

06:47.115 --> 06:47.949
Andrea!

06:48.324 --> 06:49.867

Tell them to ring the bell!

07:04.006 --> 07:05.716
[girl screams]

07:05.800 --> 07:08.344
[narrator in English]
But nothing golden can stay, man.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.596
When the government
in Mexico City figured out

07:10.680 --> 07:14.851
that a bunch of Sinaloan farmers were
getting rich shipping their dope up north,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.228
they decided to do something about it.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.314
They called it Operation Condor.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.484
It was the code name for
the government's invasion of Sinaloa...

07:23.568 --> 07:27.029
a search and destroy mission designed
to turn the drug trade into ashes.

07:27.822 --> 07:32.660
The army's goal was to burn every field
they could find, arrest every trafficker,

07:33.244 --> 07:36.205
and remind the people living there
who was boss.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.333
[overlapping chatter]

07:47.884 --> 07:50.344

Carefully! Carefully!

WELCOME TO BADIRAGUATO

08:26.464 --> 08:28.424
[grunts]

08:41.187 --> 08:42.772
We are the national army.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.817
We're here to liberate you
from the traffickers of Sinaloa

08:46.901 --> 08:50.196
who have acted in defiance of
the federal government for too long.

08:50.279 --> 08:54.534
Come out with your hands in the air,
or we will enter by force.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.537
-[priest] Get out there, Rafa!
-[Rafa] They'll kill me if I do.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.914
They'll kill us all if you don't.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.551
[car engine stops]

09:22.937 --> 09:25.147
[commander] On my signal,
I want you to shoot at the door.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.483
I just want them to know we're here. Okay?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.235
Good job, Commander.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.737
I'll get him out. The man
you're looking for is Rafa Quintero.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.073
[commander]
Wait! Who the fuck are you?

09:35.241 --> 09:37.076
-Who am I?
-Yes. Who are you?

09:37.493 --> 09:42.123
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.
Sinaloa State Police. At your service.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.959
And do you realize that we're
in the middle of an operation?

09:45.042 --> 09:46.502
[scoffs]

09:47.503 --> 09:49.463
Come on, Commander. It's a church.

09:50.631 --> 09:52.758
There are children in there.
There are women.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.179
You hardly need to make such a fuss
to get a single man, right?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.141
Let me get him out.
Everyone here knows me. Wait.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.019
[Félix]
Father, I'm coming in.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.732
Okay. If he doesn't come out
in 30 seconds,

10:07.815 --> 10:09.859
I want everyone to start shooting.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.487

10:30.755 --> 10:33.799
There you have him...
Rafael Caro Quintero.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.470
An illiterate moron
who works for Pedro Avilés,

10:37.553 --> 10:39.930
the biggest drug dealer in Sinaloa.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.518
The government has sent the army now.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.854
Now you're really fucked.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.522
I want you to tell the gentleman here

10:48.606 --> 10:50.608
the location of the fields
they haven't burned.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.902
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about-- [grunts]

10:52.985 --> 10:54.362
[coughing]

10:55.196 --> 10:57.615
-[Félix] All right, let's try that again.
-[Rafa groans]

10:57.698 --> 11:00.076
Where the fuck are the fields
they haven't burned?

11:01.327 --> 11:02.912
-I don't know!
-[grunts]

11:02.995 --> 11:04.580
[Rafa groans]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.290
Pay attention, moron.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.835
Where are the Tameapa fields
they haven't burned?

11:10.378 --> 11:12.922
Up there, sir! Up there!

11:13.005 --> 11:16.050
On the other side of the hill,
two kilometers past the river. [coughs]

11:20.596 --> 11:23.432
Never met a Sinaloan cop like you.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.645
-What do you say? Can I take him?
-Of course.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.815
We still have a lot more fields to burn.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.734
Gentlemen! Let's go!

11:34.944 --> 11:36.570
There! Hey! Stay calm.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.364
There you go.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.290
[Rafa] Look at what
these fucking assholes have done.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.750
Be quiet.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.687
[muffled speech over loudspeaker]

12:11.188 --> 12:12.356
Don't get out.

[knocks on metal door]

13:01.614 --> 13:03.699
Hey, it's me. I'm going to open the door.

13:07.912 --> 13:08.829
[boy] Dad!

13:09.038 --> 13:11.791
How's it going, son? Are you okay?

13:12.124 --> 13:14.043
We heard them ripping the place apart.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.712
They came back.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.217
Just like you said they would.
As if you'd planned it.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.303
My love, predicting is not planning.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.812
You all right?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.147
Did you protect your mom?

13:35.231 --> 13:37.483
We tried, but we were scared.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.111
Hey, you don't have to be afraid.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.446
-[girl] Okay.
-[Félix] All right.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.615
Uncle!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
Sweetie.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.460
You didn't stay in the car.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.588
Starting to hurt.
They're cutting off my circulation.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.759
Do you see what they did to my greenhouse?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.513
They didn't take all of it.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.649
[chuckles]

14:18.732 --> 14:20.609
[Rafa]
Well, that should be enough.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.571
[chuckles]

14:23.654 --> 14:26.949
I always said you were the brains
in this house, Maria.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.910
-[Rafa laughs]
-Get inside. They're gonna see you.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.453
-Go on, go inside with him!
-[grunts]

14:31.537 --> 14:33.080
Go on, go with your uncle.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.834
-You hit me really hard, asshole.
-Don't be a crybaby.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.087
I considered letting them
take all of it...

14:41.005 --> 14:43.173
buy ourselves another couple of months.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.718
No.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.305
If we don't do it now,
nothing is going to change.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.265
I know.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.851
[sighs]

14:54.894 --> 14:56.395
But I've already told you...

14:57.479 --> 15:00.608
if you want me to stop, I'll stop.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.444
That's why I could never ask it of you.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.616
I think you also predicted that,
you bastard.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.454
All right.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.213
[narrator] Military intervention
never works the way you want it to.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.799
In fact, it usually backfires.

15:26.508 --> 15:31.889
Drug dealers are like cockroaches.
You can poison them, step on them...

15:31.972 --> 15:37.227
fuck, you can set them on fire,
but they'll always come back...

15:37.311 --> 15:38.812
usually stronger than ever.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.649
Any time you think you've knocked out
the dope business,

15:41.732 --> 15:45.277
a smart trafficker, well,
he'll just find a better way.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.739
[man in Spanish]
Half the state is still smoldering.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.867
Mexico City's never cared about us.

15:53.452 --> 15:59.041
They only care about showing the Americans
they can control the marijuana business.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.459
Yes.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.880
But with crisis... comes opportunity.
Right?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.967
-You taught me that, Governor.
-And risk.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.845
I taught you that too.

16:11.929 --> 16:15.182
I came to thank you for everything
you've done for my family.

16:15.265 --> 16:18.394
You had as much to do
with raising Rodolfo as I did.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.855
Could've had a real career
in law enforcement, Miguel.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.485
Head of state police, if you wanted.

16:26.568 --> 16:29.071
Might've even changed things around here.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.573
Maybe, right? [chuckles]

16:31.657 --> 16:34.493
But no...
you never wanted to change things.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.454
-Never wanted something bigger, right?
-[chuckles]

16:38.455 --> 16:40.124
A Sinaloan president?

16:42.042 --> 16:43.085
No.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.255
Have to make a lot of noise
to change things.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.090
I'm not one for noise.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.679
I'll tell Rodolfo you came by.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.559
-He'll be sorry he missed you.
-Yeah.

16:59.935 --> 17:02.938
Whatever you're planning, be careful.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.068
Yes.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.738
All right, Governor. Thank you.

17:16.577 --> 17:19.163
[in English] It's like
four o'clock in the morning, right?

17:19.246 --> 17:21.790
And I'm coming up from Long Beach
with a bunch of vatos.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.542
Then all of a sudden...

17:23.625 --> 17:25.127
[makes siren noise]

17:25.210 --> 17:27.504
Fucking shit, bro. Fuck.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.674
I get pulled over and this dude
is just eyeing me, right?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.844
And I'm looking at him back and he's like,
"Can I get your driver's license?"

17:33.927 --> 17:36.388
I got five pounds in the trunk
and he's fucking gonna stop me

17:36.472 --> 17:37.931
for a fucking taillight?

17:38.766 --> 17:43.353
So, anyway, I look over my shoulder,
and my boy Diaz, you know, he's like this.

17:44.021 --> 17:48.192
He's got the gun pinned against the door,
right? Oof. He's not gonna go back.

17:48.275 --> 17:52.654
If this guy asks me to pop the trunk,
I'm gonna blow his fucking head off.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.615
But all of a sudden, there's...
[imitates static]

17:56.116 --> 17:59.244
Fucking radio chirps.
"Robbery in progress. Blah, blah, blah."

17:59.328 --> 18:02.748
He comes back and he looks at me
and he says, "Hey, you know what?

18:02.831 --> 18:06.919
It's your lucky day.
Fix that fucking taillight."

18:07.002 --> 18:10.380
And I'm thinking to myself,
"My lucky day?"

18:10.464 --> 18:12.091
[laughs]

18:12.174 --> 18:13.425
[Kiki]
Crazy, bro.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.636
Hey, so what's up? We gonna do this?

18:20.682 --> 18:22.101
[sighs]

18:25.479 --> 18:26.605
A fucking quarter?

18:28.899 --> 18:30.025
Are you serious?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.276
[man]
Sample only.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.695
Like what you see, we talk next time.
I set you up with more.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.948
What I want to see is a hundred.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.493
That's not how I work, vato.
Like I said, I'll start you on a sample.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.578
Something you could've bought
off the street, right?

18:41.662 --> 18:45.791
If you want to start me off with a sample,
you take me to your warehouse,

18:45.874 --> 18:48.377
you pull out a bale,
and I take my sample from that.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.214
-What warehouse? I don't fucking know you.
-Chuy's making the fucking introduction!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.507
Thought you had this lined up.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.718
-You're wasting my time with this clown.
-Listen to me, puto...

18:56.802 --> 19:00.055
-He's making the fucking introduction!
-Hey! Chill! Chill! Chill!

19:00.139 --> 19:01.682
[sighs]

19:01.765 --> 19:04.893
[Chuy] Yo, he didn't get that shit off
the street, man. I can speak for that.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.186
[Kiki] All right.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.650
I didn't come here
for a fucking sample. All right?

19:11.733 --> 19:14.903
I came here for a supplier.
Is that gonna be you?

19:14.987 --> 19:18.657
You know what? You're kind of pushy,
homes. Yeah?

19:18.740 --> 19:21.285
So why don't you take a hit?
Chill the fuck out.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.078
You know what?

19:25.247 --> 19:28.167
I'm on parole, so I ain't hitting shit.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.713
You and your little fucking story.
What is it? Some kind of cover, puto?

19:32.796 --> 19:34.923
What, you got your cop buddies
listening in right now?

19:35.007 --> 19:38.594
[in Spanish] Look, motherfucker,
I don't like being called a fucking liar.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.678
And worse...

19:40.762 --> 19:41.972
a fucking cop.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.434
[in English] What's he doing?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.937
[raises volume on TV]

19:49.021 --> 19:51.565
-[feedback screeches]
-Jesus! Fuck.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.944
[in English] Hey, whoever's listening,
they can't hear us right now.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.947
-Hey...
-No, no, no.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.617
-What the fuck?
-Did he just pull out a gun?

20:02.075 --> 20:05.913
See that? Point it at my head.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.373
Point it at me. Point it at me!

20:08.457 --> 20:11.501
-Hey, you're fucking crazy, man.
-Go like this.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.961
Yeah, yeah. There you go.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.923
You'd know what would work better?
Like that.

20:16.006 --> 20:19.259
-Guys, relax. Give it a second.
-Gotta get him out of there. Come on.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.385
Can't hear a fucking thing!

20:20.928 --> 20:23.847
If I was a fucking cop
and I had a gun pointed to my head,

20:23.931 --> 20:27.643
they'd be rushing through that fucking
door and blowing you motherfuckers away.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.936
Get him the fuck out of there!

20:39.029 --> 20:40.656
[turns off TV]

20:41.990 --> 20:43.617
[sighs]

20:43.700 --> 20:45.160
[laughs]

20:45.702 --> 20:47.329
[dealer]
That was crazy, fucker, eh?

20:47.412 --> 20:48.872
-I told you.
-It was funny though.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.458
[dealer in Spanish] Get him a beer.
[in English] I hear you, bro.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.001
-I'm on parole too.
-Yeah.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.879
-It's a bitch, you know? [chuckles]
-[Kiki] Fucking bitch, bro.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.590
"Pull it, pull it." You're fucking crazy.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.384
-I like you, puto. I like you.
-[chuckles]

21:00.467 --> 21:02.302
Oh.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.638
Yeah, yo. So listen.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.056
So it's like this, homie.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.891
I got a shipment landing next week.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.476
-So once it gets here...
-Right.

21:09.559 --> 21:13.313
...you come to my spot, and then you can
feel all the bales you want, carnal.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.357
-[in Spanish] All right.
-[man] All right. Cheers.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.151
[in English] I'm gonna take that quarter
so my homies can get your...

21:18.235 --> 21:19.695
-samples.
-[laughs]

21:20.821 --> 21:21.822
Fresno P.D.!

21:21.905 --> 21:23.782
Fresno P.D.? What the fuck?

21:23.865 --> 21:27.869
Stay down! Turn around! Get the fuck down!
Against the wall! Now!

21:27.953 --> 21:28.996
-Shit.
-Fuck!

21:29.079 --> 21:31.123
-Hang tight. Can we move in on this?
-Fuck!

21:31.540 --> 21:35.335
-Hey, I'm DEA, all right?
-Yeah? And I'm fucking Olivia Newton-John.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.837
Shut the fuck up, chico.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.008
Hey, you ever hear of a DEA?

21:41.758 --> 21:46.263
Yeah, it's like...
Drug Enforcement Agency or something.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.015
-Administration.
-Yeah.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.226
Chico over here keeps saying
he's working undercover for them.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.144
[laughs]

21:52.227 --> 21:54.313
Looks like we picked up
a whole team of undercovers.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.565
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's one of my guys.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.985
Shit. Are you serious?

22:00.068 --> 22:01.778
-Yes.
-He's with you?

22:02.154 --> 22:04.448
Yeah, that's my partner.
And if it wasn't for you guys,

22:04.531 --> 22:07.200
we'd be taking down
a hundred fucking pounds next week!

22:08.952 --> 22:10.746
Well, nothing personal, buddy.

22:11.204 --> 22:13.999
Just tough telling the good hombres
from the bad sometimes.

22:14.082 --> 22:14.916
No, I get it.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.210
-[grunts]
-[all] Oh!

22:17.878 --> 22:20.464
[narrator]
Nowadays, you say you're a DEA agent,

22:20.547 --> 22:22.591
you're gonna get some respect.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.801
But back then,
people didn't know what to make of them.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.846
They'd only been around
for a couple of years.

22:27.929 --> 22:32.726
And compared to our better-known
federal agencies, the FBI and the CIA,

22:32.809 --> 22:34.311
they were nobodies.

22:34.394 --> 22:38.607
In fact, in 1980,
there were more women in the NYPD

22:38.690 --> 22:40.692
than there were agents
in the entire DEA.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.780
The headquarters in D.C.
sat on top of a fucking strip club.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.116
And even though they didn't need
a reminder they came in last

22:48.200 --> 22:51.661
in the law enforcement pecking order,
they got one pretty regularly.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.168
[in English]
It was a rough one out there.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.294
[scoffs]

22:59.378 --> 23:01.880
With all due respect, sir,
it was like working with amateurs.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.966
Like six months of undercover work
down the drain because of those guys.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.094
You don't think to inform
local law enforcement

23:07.177 --> 23:09.137
that you're running an op
in their backyard?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.515
It was only an introduction.
There was no threat.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.226
-There was no need for local P.D.
-Kiki, you had a gun at your head.

23:14.309 --> 23:17.896
Sir, it-- it's more complicated than that.
You read it, sir.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.360
Fuck it. [sighs]

23:24.486 --> 23:26.321
One more scumbag off the street.

23:29.282 --> 23:30.409
Um...

23:31.660 --> 23:34.204
Has a decision been made
about my transfer, sir?

23:35.205 --> 23:36.873
[sighs]

23:39.042 --> 23:40.043
Didn't go your way.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.045
Yeah.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.804
All right.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.723
Who did they give Miami to?

23:55.183 --> 23:56.309
Was it Collins?

23:57.853 --> 24:00.063
-O'Brian?
-Does it matter?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.315
No, just tell me. I can take it.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.567
Just tell me.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.405
Kershaw?

24:09.197 --> 24:10.282
Yeah.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.160
I didn't know he put in for it.

24:13.243 --> 24:18.081
What am I always telling you?
Attitude and experience are factors.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.541
Kershaw has both.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.085
I got attitude! Want more attitude?
I'll give you more attitude.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.337
Your time will come.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.132
Five years on post here isn't enough, sir?

24:29.092 --> 24:30.635
What other post is available, sir?

24:32.596 --> 24:33.597
What do you have?

24:35.557 --> 24:38.185
-[woman in English] Guadalajara?
-That's all that was available.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.604
If I stay here,
my career's just gonna die.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.607
I'm serious.
No, no, I mean-- You know what?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.901
If you don't move on,
you don't move up. That's the way.

24:46.359 --> 24:47.569
That from the handbook?

24:49.654 --> 24:53.033
What do you want me to say, Kiki?
It's not Miami.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.075
[scoffs]

24:54.159 --> 24:58.121
Miami. Fucking Kershaw. I swear.
It's fucking bullshit.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.789
Dunn's a fucking asshole.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.458
Five years for what?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.335
I'll stop. I'll stop.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.253
-Kikito's about to bat.
-All right.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.340
All right, let's go, Kikito.
Just like I said.

25:08.423 --> 25:11.510
Keep your eye on the ball and swing
through it, okay? Hey!

25:11.593 --> 25:14.429
Keep it simple. Remember, remember,
from the ground up, rotate, release,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.223
and keep your eye on the ball. Let's go.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.224
[crowd] Whoa!

25:17.307 --> 25:18.683
[Kiki] That's not how we practiced.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.522
That's your dad's genes at work
right there.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.901
-Good contact, Kikito!
-Yeah, good contact.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.277
[woman] Nice hit!

25:29.361 --> 25:31.488
[overlapping chatter]

25:37.202 --> 25:39.329
I mean, we could always move back
to Calexico.

25:40.038 --> 25:45.252
I got a better idea. Why don't you quit?
Fuck it. Become a fireman again.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.717
No, I can do other things.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.679
I can do other things.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.764
Sure you can, honey.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.454
-[in Spanish] Nervous?
-Yes.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.498
It's time.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.626
Yes, it's time.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.754
It's time you buy some new clothes, man.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.225
Hello, Joaquin.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.810
Are you coming in?

26:44.227 --> 26:49.024
No. I'm just the farmer.
That part's on you.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.235
All right.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.661
[man]
Don't you fuck with me!

27:01.745 --> 27:03.580
Six fucking months!

27:04.289 --> 27:06.166
We need to replant everything again.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.543
That's the thing.
We lost everything, boss.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.004
The entire damn field.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.632
And what were you doing
while they burned my fields?

27:14.841 --> 27:16.468
He lost an eye, Pedro.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.556
Yeah, I see that.
Thank you for your sacrifice, Hector.

27:23.224 --> 27:24.768
But the rest of you?

27:26.269 --> 27:29.230
I see a lot of
two-eyed motherfuckers in here!

27:30.940 --> 27:32.567
What the fuck did any of you do?

27:36.321 --> 27:37.697
Go to Durango.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.284
Tell Gomez to sell us whatever he's got.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.954
-It might be enough to hold us over.
-Done.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.040
[Félix]
Excuse me, boss.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.208
If you'll allow me...

27:49.793 --> 27:54.005
I have an idea to solve this for good.

27:54.089 --> 27:57.717
Well, fuck. Didn't this guy
used to babysit the governor's kid?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.220
Could have gotten a heads-up from him.

28:00.303 --> 28:03.056
He's the governor of Sinaloa.
They don't tell him shit.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.726
With all due respect, boss,

28:06.810 --> 28:10.855
but the army burns our fields,
and what do we do?

28:11.398 --> 28:15.318
We buy Durango weed
and hope to stay alive, really? Again?

28:16.319 --> 28:20.031
We'll end up the same or
even more screwed when they come back.

28:20.490 --> 28:23.118
We have to restart
the business somewhere else.

28:23.660 --> 28:27.163
Where they can't touch us.
Where they wouldn't even try.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.749
We have to go to Guadalajara.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.004
We're nobodies there.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.799
We're nobodies here, Don Neto.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.887
The army invades us, and what?

28:43.263 --> 28:46.057
No fucking journalists
will write about it.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.560
They do this because we are Sinaloans.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.353
We're fucked. Nothing happens here.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.939
Things are different there.

28:54.274 --> 28:58.611
There are banks there,
big businesses, and fancy people.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.947
I'd like to see the government
send the army there.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.117
It would be a huge mess.
Front-page news and all that shit.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.831
I say it's the only way.
But whatever you say, boss.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.167
What does this fucker know?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.377
He's not a trafficker.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.880
-He's a cop.
-Ex-cop.

29:16.963 --> 29:18.590
Even worse.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.925
[all chuckle]

29:21.009 --> 29:25.472
Let's see... Guadalajara
is still run by the Naranjo brothers.

29:25.555 --> 29:29.934
Think those fucking animals are gonna
let us move into their territory, Pedro?

29:30.018 --> 29:31.394
You are the Lion of Sinaloa.

29:32.061 --> 29:34.105
The guy who invented the game.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.441
They'd be fools not to negotiate.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.402
They're going to laugh at us.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.529
No one fucking laughs at me.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.451
Go to Guadalajara.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.578
Sit down with them.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.331
If you can't make a deal...

29:51.831 --> 29:52.999
it's on you.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.211
Sounds good.

29:56.503 --> 29:59.547
I just ask that you send someone with me,
to lend me credibility.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.174
He's right about that.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.091
[laughs]

30:04.219 --> 30:07.305
-Who do you have in mind?
-Don Neto would do.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.224
Well, shit. [laughs]

30:14.020 --> 30:16.189
[over TV in English]
Fast ball here, but you'd never know

30:16.272 --> 30:17.816
the way Horton's got the slider working.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.943
He could be bringing that
on three and two.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.362
Two outs here in the seventh.
Still tied at two.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.781
Lafayette led two-nothing
most of the game

30:24.864 --> 30:28.493
until Ramirez's two-run double
tied it up in a hurry.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.786
How many more you gonna have?

30:31.704 --> 30:33.039
[exhales]

30:33.122 --> 30:36.125
I don't know.
I mean, that's only my sixth one.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.798
[refrigerator door opens and closes]

30:41.881 --> 30:44.092
[glass bottle clanking]

30:44.175 --> 30:47.887
[announcer] ...for four weeks earlier
in the year with a bad elbow.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.013
Pitching coach...

30:49.097 --> 30:50.265
[sighs]

30:52.350 --> 30:56.646
Apparently, he was uploading
a fraction of a second early...

30:56.729 --> 30:59.774
I'd have my own, but I wouldn't want her
to turn out like you.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.860
-Yeah, nobody wants that.
-[chuckles]

31:02.151 --> 31:04.362
[announcer]
He's been stellar all year.

31:04.445 --> 31:07.615
Absolutely.
There's the wind-up and the pitch.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.869
Little flare up the right side.
Danny can't get it...

31:10.952 --> 31:12.704
Why are you looking at me like that?

31:14.455 --> 31:15.832
I think you know.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.251
I don't.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.462
I don't want to stay in Fresno.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.185
You're tired of the same. I am too.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.188
So let's change it.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.275
Together.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.819
Show them what they're not seeing.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.322
You sure you want that?

31:47.822 --> 31:49.115
Don't you?

31:51.075 --> 31:54.329
Take Mexico, Kiki. Prove them wrong.

31:57.957 --> 31:58.958
What about you?

32:00.752 --> 32:03.880
I have to check, but I'm pretty sure
women give birth in Mexico too.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.256
Right.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.387
[Mika sighs]

32:23.066 --> 32:24.442
[in Spanish] Passports.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.992
Welcome to Mexico.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.055
[in Spanish]
I brought those for all of us.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.142
Take the ones I didn't take for myself.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.354
[inhales]

33:03.481 --> 33:04.691
[exhales]

33:09.112 --> 33:10.697
You must think you're pretty smart,

33:10.780 --> 33:13.116
kissing Pedro's ass
to get him to back you.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.744
Let me explain how this shit works.

33:17.453 --> 33:21.290
These guys, the Naranjo brothers,
they're the competition.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.918
They don't give a shit
about the "Lion of Sinaloa."

33:24.002 --> 33:26.212
And they certainly
don't give a shit about you.

33:27.130 --> 33:30.925
I'm treating this like a vacation to
Guadalajara. Gonna have a lot of fun.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.011
I ain't part of your plan.

33:34.053 --> 33:39.308
I'll get you a meeting and then
I'll sit back and watch you go down.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.103
Got it?

33:43.312 --> 33:44.897
Yeah, got it.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.691
And another thing...

33:47.442 --> 33:50.153
that ass-kissing shit? It cuts both ways.

33:50.570 --> 33:56.743
You embarrass Pedro, make him look weak,
he'll blow holes in you.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.537
That goes for you too, cupcake.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.211
[Pedro Infante's "La Calandria" playing]

35:06.521 --> 35:07.563
[Félix]
Go ahead.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.275
[Don Neto]
What's going on?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.278
Rafa!

35:15.571 --> 35:17.532
Once you finish,
go straight to the hotel, okay?

35:18.783 --> 35:20.827
-Okay.
-Brother...

35:22.078 --> 35:23.287
this is serious.

35:23.955 --> 35:24.997
Okay.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.087
Is he looking
for vocational guidance or what?

35:48.521 --> 35:52.024
SCHOOL OF GEOLOGY

35:59.532 --> 36:01.159
I'm getting a drink.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.580
[hotel clerk]
Located on San Pedro Street.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.581
Yes.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.250
Mm-hmm.

36:10.126 --> 36:10.960
Yes.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.087
Perfect.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.256
Yes, sir. You're welcome.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.426
Do you have two rooms?

36:18.801 --> 36:20.261
How long is your stay?

36:21.012 --> 36:23.055
Well, indefinitely.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.700
[man]
Don Neto.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.579
I was surprised to hear you were in town.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.040
It was an unplanned trip.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.126
[Don Neto]
Babysitting this one.

36:56.672 --> 36:57.924
How's your brother?

36:58.758 --> 37:00.051
All good.

37:03.679 --> 37:05.431
I heard about the army.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.937
They burned the goods again, right?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.439
Too bad.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.279
But if you want to kill rats,
guess you have to go into the sewer.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.990
-Right?
-Yes.

37:23.866 --> 37:24.784
Yes, of course.

37:25.618 --> 37:28.829
Anyway, like I said,
I'm here to introduce you to this guy.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.540
He's got a proposal for you.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.670
-A proposal? How nice.
-Yes.

37:36.629 --> 37:37.964
Let's hear it then.

37:38.631 --> 37:42.051
After that mess
that happened in Sinaloa...

37:42.635 --> 37:45.763
an opportunity was born
for our organizations.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.766
We're looking for a partnership.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.810
-Partnership?
-[Félix] Yes.

37:51.727 --> 37:54.063
Well, now I'm interested.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.856
It's very easy.

37:56.482 --> 38:01.737
Basically, we move
our growing operation here.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.739
We move to Guadalajara.

38:03.906 --> 38:08.661
And all we need from you
is police protection.

38:08.744 --> 38:09.745
Uh-huh.

38:09.829 --> 38:14.834
We take care of everything, the labor,
the distribution, all of the costs.

38:15.543 --> 38:20.298
And we're willing
to split the profits 50/50.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.225
Okay.

38:33.227 --> 38:36.981
I mean, we're... we're the best suited
to make this thing grow.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.524
[chuckles]

38:38.607 --> 38:40.443
Well, look at this fucker.

38:42.653 --> 38:47.366
How about this?
We split the profits 60/40.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.954
No, wait... 70/30.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.666
No... 80/20?

38:57.710 --> 39:00.713
No... 90/10.

39:02.631 --> 39:04.383
Here's my final offer.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.970
You get nothing
and get out of my fucking town.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.017
Partners?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.479
[chuckles]

39:17.021 --> 39:19.065
Is this fucking guy serious?

39:21.275 --> 39:23.944
You guys have a lot of fine pussy
in Sinaloa, right?

39:24.028 --> 39:28.657
Well, since everyone is going to starve,
why don't you send us the best you got?

39:28.741 --> 39:30.493
We'll find work for them here.

39:32.661 --> 39:33.746
[chuckles]

39:34.538 --> 39:35.706
[knocks on table]

39:38.417 --> 39:41.420
Tell the Lion that we're laughing at him
in Guadalajara.

39:41.962 --> 39:42.922
"Partnership."

39:43.005 --> 39:45.007
You know what?
I have another proposal for you.

39:45.091 --> 39:46.675
-[gunshot]
-Oh, really? [grunts]

39:46.759 --> 39:48.761
-[screaming]
-[gunshot]

39:48.844 --> 39:50.471
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:53.140 --> 39:55.059
[screaming]

39:55.601 --> 39:57.144
Did you go crazy, motherfucker?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.897
Any minute now, this place is gonna be
crawling with cops, their cops,

39:59.980 --> 40:02.441
who are gonna drive us straight
to his brother to burn us alive.

40:03.609 --> 40:04.443
Rafa.

40:05.945 --> 40:06.904
Come on.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.282
You're crazy. Fuck you both.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.702
Come on. Show me.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.454
Come on, show it to me.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.085
I spoke to the geologist. He said that...

40:22.920 --> 40:24.046
Here.

40:27.007 --> 40:29.760
-Seriously?
-[Rafa] It's closer than we thought.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.429
We just have to dig.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.060
Hey... stick to the plan.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.989
[phones ringing]

40:50.072 --> 40:52.116
[typewriters clacking]

40:52.199 --> 40:55.119
[in English] Hi, I'm Kiki Camarena.
I'm looking for a Jaime Kuykendall.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.329
Mr. Kuykendall is in the back
waiting for you.

40:57.413 --> 40:58.414
Thank you.

41:08.424 --> 41:09.675
[man]
Agent Camarena.

41:10.384 --> 41:13.220
-Yes, sir.
-Jaime. Jaime Kuykendall.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.430
Nice to meet you.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.807
-Welcome to Guadalajara.
-Thank you, sir.

41:16.891 --> 41:17.850
Come on back.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.978
[Jaime]
So how was the trip down?

41:21.061 --> 41:22.688
It was a little long, sir.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.732
Having a six-year-old in the back
didn't help.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.192
[chuckles]

41:28.402 --> 41:31.447
But I look forward to getting started.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.533
I take it you speak Spanish?

41:34.909 --> 41:38.913
[in Spanish] Well, the tan isn't
from the sun. I was born this way.

41:39.371 --> 41:41.916
[in English] Well, how did that
play with the boys up in Fresno?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.292
Uh...

41:43.375 --> 41:44.752
Like you might expect, sir.

41:46.420 --> 41:51.133
[in Spanish] My wife is from Chiapas.
But we like it better here.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.302
[in English]
Yeah, I think you will too.

41:53.385 --> 41:56.472
I mean, the truth is, this office
has been needing someone like you.

41:56.555 --> 41:59.975
Don't get me wrong. Agents Knapp
and Sears, they're strong agents,

42:00.059 --> 42:03.687
but ethnicity poses its limitations
on the locals here.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.147
Sure, yeah. No, I'd imagine

42:05.231 --> 42:07.858
that the informants
probably feel a little safer

42:07.942 --> 42:11.445
-talking corruption to a fellow Mexican.
-So you get how Mexico works.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.572
Uh, well, my grandmother's
from Guadalajara

42:13.656 --> 42:16.158
and I used to spend
a lot of time here as a kid.

42:17.243 --> 42:20.246
Well, the Mex-Feds are crooked as hell,
but they're what we got.

42:20.329 --> 42:22.248
You know, we work with them best we can.

42:22.331 --> 42:25.668
-[chuckles] We try to, anyway.
-Right.

42:25.751 --> 42:29.588
Uh, sir, is there a case
that you want me to jump on?

42:35.511 --> 42:36.470
[clears throat]

42:36.554 --> 42:40.766
It may serve you better
to think about this as more of a, uh...

42:41.392 --> 42:43.477
a data-gathering assignment

42:43.561 --> 42:47.356
rather than a traditional
law enforcement posting.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.650
You know, we can't arrest anyone.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.944
We don't have that power.

42:52.570 --> 42:56.782
We just gather intelligence best we can,
and send it on to the agents up north.

42:56.865 --> 42:57.992
Ah.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.744
Like a neighborhood watch.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.832
We do the best we can.

43:06.166 --> 43:09.420
No, I understand, sir. Sorry.
I understand, like, you know--

43:09.503 --> 43:14.049
If data gathering is what you do,
then, uh, I'm all in, sir.

43:14.133 --> 43:17.344
[knocks on desk] Good. All right.
So we hit the Camelot around 5:00.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.014
That's the bar across the street.
You should join us.

43:20.389 --> 43:24.393
I mean, you've seen the desert.
It's time to meet the snakes.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.494
[in Spanish] Federal Security Directorate!
On your feet!

43:43.162 --> 43:45.247
I want to see your hands! Hands!

43:45.331 --> 43:46.457
Hello.

43:46.540 --> 43:48.334
Don't do anything stupid.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.128
Search them.

43:55.174 --> 43:56.258
Let's go.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.434
We found this fat fuck headed out of town.

44:05.517 --> 44:07.561
They're going to kill us
and it's your fault, asshole.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.772
Let's go. Stop talking. Let's go.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.252
I'm a cop, too.

44:33.837 --> 44:34.963
At least I was.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.133
State police.

44:38.634 --> 44:42.096
I used to patrol the fields at night
back in Sinaloa.

44:42.846 --> 44:48.018
One night, I found a man clipping buds
from the stalks back in the fields.

44:50.020 --> 44:51.271
Poor bastard.

44:52.398 --> 44:55.025
Stealing from men
who don't know how to forgive...

44:56.568 --> 44:58.153
just like you.

44:58.737 --> 45:01.782
They asked me to kill him
and "make him disappear."

45:02.700 --> 45:03.992
Do you know what I did?

45:05.911 --> 45:08.497
I drove him out to the edge
of the desert...

45:09.790 --> 45:12.918
I pulled him out of the car,
and told him to run.

45:14.169 --> 45:17.131
I told him to go straight
until the sun rose.

45:19.758 --> 45:23.554
That man... was the brother of a cop.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.433
He was just starting out.

45:28.892 --> 45:30.811
They called him "El Azul."

45:37.025 --> 45:39.820
But I think you call him
something else, no?

45:41.280 --> 45:43.031
I think you call him "Commander."

45:47.161 --> 45:48.579
Take me to him.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.250
Or we'll see
if you don't end up just like me.

46:00.966 --> 46:06.305
[Knapp in English] We got two whiskeys,
three Cuba libres, and cinco cervezas.

46:06.388 --> 46:10.017
So you just buy them drinks all night
and hope they give you something?

46:10.100 --> 46:11.977
Drunker they get, the more they spill.

46:13.437 --> 46:17.733
Look, nobody talks more shit
than a drunk Mexican cop.

46:19.693 --> 46:20.986
I got it.

46:21.069 --> 46:22.988
[overlapping chatter]

46:30.662 --> 46:32.080
[in Spanish]
You're new here, right?

46:33.290 --> 46:34.583
Just got here.

46:36.001 --> 46:37.085
Welcome to Guadalajara.

46:39.254 --> 46:40.172
Are you on duty?

46:41.673 --> 46:43.300
Everyone here is on duty. Look.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.887
-Kiki Camarena.
-Sammy Álvarez.

46:46.970 --> 46:49.097
-These guys all cops?
-Yeah.

46:49.681 --> 46:52.810
The ones in uniform,
those are the Guadalajara municipal cops.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.062
In other words, local shit.

46:56.104 --> 46:59.316
The ones in blue are
from the Jalisco State Police.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.027
The one over here is my captain.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.113
And the judicial police?

47:05.197 --> 47:07.699
The two tables in the back, the federales.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.286
The one talking to your boss,
that's Commander Rojas.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.873
And the one next to him
is Commander Mendez.

47:15.874 --> 47:17.918
You guys like to buy drinks, eh?

47:19.086 --> 47:20.671
That's the American way.

47:21.755 --> 47:23.966
-Do you want one?
-Sure, I'll take the same.

48:09.386 --> 48:10.679
[Tomás in Spanish]
Commander.

48:11.346 --> 48:12.556
Commander.

48:13.223 --> 48:14.516
Good evening, everyone.

48:15.601 --> 48:17.352
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

48:24.109 --> 48:25.110
Tomás.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.946
Who are your friends?

48:28.030 --> 48:30.616
This is the guy who saved
your brother's life back in Sinaloa.

48:31.116 --> 48:34.077
Thought maybe you'd want to talk to him
before we kill him, boss.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.454
What a good idea.

48:35.537 --> 48:37.372
[chuckles]

48:37.456 --> 48:40.667
Except I don't have a brother,
you fucking idiot.

48:41.335 --> 48:42.920
We're here to make you a proposal.

48:43.003 --> 48:47.758
This is their deal, I'm not with them.
Just to make it clear.

48:48.592 --> 48:50.677
Yeah, they told me you had a proposal.

48:50.761 --> 48:54.431
I heard you had a meeting with
Hernin Naranjo. And it didn't go well.

48:54.973 --> 48:58.518
My deal is only for you.
It was never for the Naranjos.

48:58.602 --> 49:01.897
My offer is in that bag.

49:07.653 --> 49:11.823
It's our new strain. It's much stronger
than the shit you have here.

49:13.241 --> 49:15.953
Jesus! Give me one of our kilos.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.292
They both weigh the same. How?

49:22.376 --> 49:24.503
Tell him, bro.

49:24.586 --> 49:27.214
Well, I bred out the male strain.

49:27.297 --> 49:31.134
The males would cross pollinate the female
and so... there's no seeds.

49:31.218 --> 49:36.431
Your dope's filled with stems, seeds,
shit you can't smoke.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.433
So it takes up less space.

49:38.517 --> 49:41.436
We can transport much more
using the same number of trucks.

49:42.646 --> 49:43.897
I'm looking for a partner.

49:44.523 --> 49:47.109
I'm offering 50 percent.
What do you think?

49:47.859 --> 49:50.320
-And what do you call this?
-What do we call it?

49:51.530 --> 49:53.156
Seedless.

49:54.116 --> 49:55.033
[chuckles]

49:55.117 --> 49:56.410
[Hernin]
Where are the fuckers?

50:00.288 --> 50:02.708
These are the motherfuckers
who killed my brother?

50:02.791 --> 50:04.376
-Calm down.
-No, fuck that!

50:04.459 --> 50:06.962
Want to explain to me why
this fucking guy's still breathing?

50:07.045 --> 50:09.047
These sons of bitches die right now!

50:12.718 --> 50:14.177
[El Azul]
Put the gun down.

50:16.304 --> 50:17.347
Lower it.

50:26.982 --> 50:29.026
This fucking guy just killed my brother!

50:32.696 --> 50:34.364
You'll have to excuse me.

50:36.616 --> 50:38.452
But I've gotta look after my partners.

50:43.415 --> 50:46.251
Go get them! Tomás, take care of it.

50:51.882 --> 50:52.883
And you...

50:53.425 --> 50:55.427
didn't you say you aren't with these guys?

50:56.303 --> 50:58.638
Wait, wait, wait. He's with us.

50:58.722 --> 51:01.016
-It was just a joke.
-Yeah.

51:01.099 --> 51:04.478
-[two gunshots from a distance]
-He was dragging his feet.

51:07.439 --> 51:09.733
[chuckles]

51:10.776 --> 51:11.985
That's good.

51:14.613 --> 51:16.323
I want my money every month.

51:17.449 --> 51:21.661
I figure it'll take a little while...
for it to grow.

51:21.745 --> 51:22.954
Yeah.

51:24.498 --> 51:25.415
All right.

51:27.667 --> 51:30.629
First month is courtesy of the Naranjos.

51:34.299 --> 51:35.550
It's a pleasure.

51:44.976 --> 51:47.938
[in Spanish] My uncle is
from the Jalisco State Police.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.857
One day, he calls me
and tells me to go to his house.

51:50.941 --> 51:53.360
And to bring some money.
And he starts to count it.

51:53.443 --> 51:54.277
Bah, bah, bah.

51:55.320 --> 52:00.408
All of a sudden...
he says that I am now a cop too.

52:00.492 --> 52:05.122
I suppose I was helping someone
get out of trouble,

52:05.205 --> 52:07.791
and in exchange, he got me a job.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.293
At least you have a job, right?

52:10.836 --> 52:13.004
He takes ten percent of what I make.

52:13.088 --> 52:15.215
-What a nice guy, your uncle.
-[chuckles]

52:25.058 --> 52:26.226
Who are they?

52:26.309 --> 52:27.561
[Jaime in English]
The boogeyman.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.564
[in Spanish]
Three whiskies.

52:30.897 --> 52:32.023
[Sammy in English]
Thank you.

52:34.109 --> 52:36.319
[in English]
Those boys are DFS.

52:37.028 --> 52:38.864
Federal Security Directorate.

52:39.739 --> 52:43.827
They're kind of like the KGB
and the Gestapo all rolled into one.

52:43.910 --> 52:45.203
Ah.

52:45.287 --> 52:47.372
-Guess we're not buying them drinks.
-No.

52:47.873 --> 52:49.666
No, they get theirs from the CIA.

52:51.334 --> 52:54.713
Yeah. We steer clear of them,
they do the same for us.

52:55.380 --> 52:56.882
That's just kind of the deal.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.302
Right. No, I get it.

53:01.052 --> 53:04.347
Not our ballgame.
We just provide the refreshments.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.266
You learn quick.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.034
[toilet flushes]

53:24.117 --> 53:25.702
[water running]

53:40.550 --> 53:42.761
[in Spanish]
Hey, could you hand me one?

53:42.844 --> 53:43.845
Sure.

53:46.431 --> 53:47.515
Thank you.

53:48.975 --> 53:51.019
You've got blood on your shoes.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.315
[in Spanish]
This is it.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.651
It's a desert.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.195
But there's a lot of water underneath.

54:42.862 --> 54:46.366
Enough to grow all the dope
the U.S. can smoke in a year.

54:46.866 --> 54:48.743
You learn that at college?

54:48.827 --> 54:52.038
[chuckles] Hey.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.456
[Félix chuckles]

54:54.582 --> 54:57.502
That true? What he said back there?
Did he create that shit?

54:58.128 --> 54:59.713
Yes. It's his baby.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.174
Well, then he's a genius!

55:05.010 --> 55:06.553
That's why you brought him.

55:07.887 --> 55:10.515
We're starting
to understand each other, Don Neto.

55:12.309 --> 55:14.936
[Don Neto chuckles]

55:15.020 --> 55:19.190
If you guys had that magic weed,
why not plant it back home?

55:19.357 --> 55:23.111
It can't be done.
It can't grow near any other dope.

55:23.903 --> 55:25.655
The strain would be contaminated.

55:26.614 --> 55:30.035
For these fuckers to grow...
they have to be alone.

55:33.538 --> 55:34.789
And Avilés?

55:35.832 --> 55:37.876
What's he going to think
about all of this?

55:38.918 --> 55:40.545
I don't know. What do you think?

55:41.755 --> 55:44.507
Being the biggest trafficker in Mexico?

55:45.133 --> 55:46.885
I think he'll like it.

55:47.802 --> 55:50.847
He seems like that sort of guy. [scoffs]

55:52.474 --> 55:53.850
And why me?

55:55.560 --> 55:56.811
I've got a plan.

55:56.895 --> 55:58.813
[chuckles] I don't doubt it.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.858
Either way, you're still fucking crazy.

56:02.984 --> 56:06.404
But maybe you know more
about this business than I thought.

56:08.656 --> 56:11.034
No, I'm not interested in your business.

56:13.953 --> 56:17.248
What I'm doing here...
is building an empire.
