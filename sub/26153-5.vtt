00:08.008 --> 00:09.426
[birds chirping]

00:10.260 --> 00:12.387
-[Peter] You have a beautiful home.
-[Tanner] Thanks.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.973
-[Peter] Ah, you'll be sitting here.
-[Tanner] Okay.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.183
[Peter] If you don't mind.
Thank you so much.

00:17.267 --> 00:21.229
So, we're just curious as to why
you went to the police about Kevin.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.356
I didn't do it out of spite.

00:24.232 --> 00:27.610
I mean, I wasn't setting out
to ruin Kevin's life.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.739
I saw what I saw and I know he did it.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.493
And I've known Kevin for a long time.
When he gets his mind set on something,

00:37.162 --> 00:38.413
there's no stopping him.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.207
I felt a responsibility to stop him.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.378
Look...

00:46.046 --> 00:47.630
Kevin and I used to be like brothers.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.924
And now he won't take any of my calls,

00:50.008 --> 00:52.177
I'm pretty sure he blocked me
on everything.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.763
It's like our friendship never existed.

00:55.638 --> 00:57.640
And then there's Chloe. [scoffs]

00:58.850 --> 01:01.227
Ever since I went to the police,
she won't even talk to me.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.565
All because Kevin went crazy
and did that Turd Burglar stuff.

01:06.441 --> 01:07.776
[paper rustles]

01:07.859 --> 01:10.153
What if Kevin didn't do it?

01:11.821 --> 01:14.574
We wanted to sit down with you
because of something Sam discovered.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.077
So, just bear with me here
while we explain this.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.328
So, for each of the crimes,

01:18.411 --> 01:21.706
the Turd Burglar would post warning post
and an aftermath post.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.501
The aftermath post
is a close-up of the device

01:24.584 --> 01:26.294
used to have committed the crime.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.088
We're calling those "delivery devices."

01:28.171 --> 01:31.800
So, the lemonade dispenser,
the piñata, the T-shirt launcher,

01:31.883 --> 01:33.510
-those are all delivery devices.
-Uh-huh.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.513
Okay, so, on November 30th,

01:36.596 --> 01:40.266
we first have a warning post
warning of a December 4th crime.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.938
Then, on December 4th,
we have another post

01:45.021 --> 01:46.439
of the advent calendar,

01:46.523 --> 01:48.608
which also seemed to warn
of a fourth crime.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.235
The thing is, we have no evidence

01:50.318 --> 01:53.655
of a fourth crime happening,
so we just thought that it never happened.

01:54.155 --> 01:59.410
But to us, this December 4th post
is actually an aftermath post.

01:59.494 --> 02:01.663
Because that's no ordinary
advent calendar.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.957
That's the custom one
from the teachers' lounge,

02:04.040 --> 02:06.167
which, as you know,
no students are allowed in,

02:06.251 --> 02:08.253
but I saw it with my own two eyes.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.797
How did you get into the teachers' lounge?

02:10.880 --> 02:13.883
They're really-- They're super strict
about letting students in.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
Fearless journalism. I don't know.

02:16.052 --> 02:19.180
We were just interviewing
Ms. Montgomery. Anyway.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.975
So, if that advent calendar
is a delivery--

02:22.058 --> 02:24.519
-If this was a delivery device...
-Right.

02:25.728 --> 02:26.604
Then...?

02:27.021 --> 02:28.940
Then there was a fourth crime.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.066
Precisely.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.943
You think there was a fourth crime?

02:32.569 --> 02:33.444
Maybe.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.572
And we actually spoke with the faculty,

02:35.655 --> 02:39.534
and this advent calendar isn't even placed
in the teachers' lounge until December,

02:39.617 --> 02:42.662
and Kevin was placed under house arrest
in November.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.582
In fact, his ankle monitor went on
on November 30th,

02:45.874 --> 02:48.585
and it wouldn't allow him
within 100 yards of the school.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.627
Well, then...

02:52.088 --> 02:52.922
That's it.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
-This looks good for you, Kevin.
-Right?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.969
How would you feel if you maybe
accused your best friend

02:58.052 --> 02:59.429
of something he didn't do?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.264
I-I'd feel terrible.

03:02.932 --> 03:03.933
[chuckles]

03:05.977 --> 03:06.978
I'd feel terrible.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.357
[intro music playing]

03:49.646 --> 03:52.190
[Peter] If a crime did take place
on December 4th,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.275
it would change everything.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.570
It would place the Turd Burglar
still at large,

03:58.029 --> 04:00.198
still actively targeting the school

04:00.490 --> 04:03.117
after Kevin was expelled
and put on house arrest.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.536
It would exonerate Kevin.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.539
But it would also raise more questions.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.751
What exactly happened
in the teachers' lounge?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.544
And why was it never reported?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.255
Who was involved?

04:15.713 --> 04:19.550
We figured the best place to start
was to talk to the C-Hall janitor,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.679
whose duties include cleaning
the teachers' lounge.

04:22.845 --> 04:26.599
[Sam] My first day was December 6th.
It was a really quick hire.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.810
I have no idea why that last guy left.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.646
Could have been 'cause of all the shit.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.273
Who knows?

04:33.731 --> 04:36.109
[Peter] So we learned
that the former C-Hall janitor

04:36.192 --> 04:37.902
quit on December 5th.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.656
If there was a fourth poop crime
in the teachers' lounge the day before,

04:41.906 --> 04:44.158
his exit starts to look suspicious.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.494
It's also worth noting

04:46.577 --> 04:49.038
that his departure
was felt throughout the student body,

04:49.706 --> 04:51.874
because the former C-Hall janitor

04:51.958 --> 04:54.711
had quite a reputation of his own.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.296
[girl] Okay, do it.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.382
[sexy music playing, girls chuckling]

05:00.300 --> 05:02.760
[girl sighs] I can't believe
we lost Hot Janitor.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.346
[girl] Oh, Hot Janitor?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.890
Everyone loves him, especially the girls,

05:07.974 --> 05:08.808
'cause he's hot.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.644
You'd never think
that mopping would be hot

05:11.728 --> 05:12.937
but, like, when he does it...

05:14.022 --> 05:14.939
Fuck.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.318
All the girls were obsessed with him,
but I never really saw it.

05:18.401 --> 05:22.196
But there is one day where someone vomited
and he was mopping that up...

05:23.281 --> 05:26.492
-That's when I saw it.
-♪ I'm just a bachelor... ♪

05:27.493 --> 05:29.370
♪ Looking for a partner ♪

05:29.454 --> 05:32.165
I consider myself, for my age,
you know, not bad looking,

05:32.248 --> 05:35.668
but apparently this was guy was all that,
you know?

05:36.544 --> 05:39.088
[Ms. Montgomery] It wouldn't
be appropriate for a teacher

05:39.172 --> 05:40.423
to say that he's a ten.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.427
But you know, he's at least a nine.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.348
[DeMarcus] Say Steve Harvey did
a Family Feud questionnaire,

05:48.431 --> 05:51.267
and they asked the girls at school,
"Who would you smash?"

05:51.351 --> 05:54.395
I feel like I would definitely
be the top choice,

05:54.479 --> 05:57.857
with, like, 49 points,
and then a close follow-up

05:57.940 --> 06:00.568
would be, like, 24 points
and that'd definitely be Hot Janitor.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.112
Changing the whole janitor game.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.449
I never found out what his real name was,

06:06.532 --> 06:08.201
so I ended up never calling him anything,

06:08.284 --> 06:10.536
'cause I certainly was never
going to call him Hot Janitor.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.581
[male teacher]
Hot Janitor was a distraction.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.876
People would top what they were doing
and watch that guy.

06:19.670 --> 06:20.880
He was muscular.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.258
So, we have our first piece of evidence

06:24.342 --> 06:26.636
that proves that there actually was
a fourth crime

06:26.719 --> 06:28.554
-that took place on December 4th.
-[Sam] Yeah.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.224
The C-Hall janitor quit on December 5th.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.600
That cannot be a coincidence.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.353
No, I don't think so either.
I think something definitely went down

06:35.436 --> 06:37.939
in the teachers' lounge on December 4th
with that advent calendar.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.149
It's saying a lot,
because he stayed after the Brownout.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.819
He did. And the Poop Piñata
and the Shit Launcher.

06:42.902 --> 06:46.489
So whatever this fourth crime was
had to have been fucking disgusting.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.866
The only way we're going to figure out
exactly what happened

06:48.950 --> 06:51.702
-is if we track down the C-Hall janitor.
-That's where things get weird,

06:51.786 --> 06:54.163
'cause I looked him up on social media,
not a thing came up.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.248
Like, nothing at all.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.042
That is weird.
The guy has zero digital fingerprint.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.210
He's off the grid.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.712
And I even asked the other janitors
for his phone number,

07:02.171 --> 07:03.965
-the number's disconnected.
-Huh.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.050
[Sam] You think he's hiding?

07:06.759 --> 07:10.304
[Peter] Hot Janitor is one of the most
documented people at St. Bernardine,

07:10.930 --> 07:13.015
but surprisingly little
is known about him.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.059
Nobody knows very much about him.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.895
Like his name
or where he comes from or anything.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.272
Which is too bad.

07:19.730 --> 07:20.982
But it's also really hot.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.360
[Peter] The Hot Janitor
was looking like another dead end.

07:24.735 --> 07:28.739
Understandably, he didn't reveal much
about his personal life at school.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.575
But thankfully

07:30.658 --> 07:33.870
we learned of someone who had
a relationship with Hot Janitor

07:33.953 --> 07:35.288
outside of school.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.956
[Lil K] Hot Janitor's cool.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.208
My brother gets his mushrooms
from Hot Janitor,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.210
which makes him my mushroom connection.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.628
Which is awesome

07:42.712 --> 07:44.964
because we needed them for Bumbershoot.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.175
It was dope.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.469
We were peaking during Major Lazer.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.806
[Peter] The sale of psychedelic mushrooms
to David Kaczmarowski's older brother

07:54.056 --> 07:56.601
led us to the woods of Sultan, Washington,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.895
an hour from St. Bernardine.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.438
These are lichens.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.231
[Sam] What's a lichen?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.066
Well, it's kind of like an epiphyte.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.320
It grows on some of the Doug firs
and the other trees around here,

08:07.403 --> 08:09.655
but it blows out in some of the high winds
during storms,

08:09.739 --> 08:11.866
so I try to collect it and put it back,
you know.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.034
You put it back in the tree?

08:13.117 --> 08:15.036
Yeah, I mean, that's where it wants to be.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.039
I've been here for a few years now.
It's almost totally off-grid.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.707
I grow most of my own food.

08:19.790 --> 08:22.001
This is mostly
cool season annuals in here.

08:22.084 --> 08:25.046
I've got some violas and pansies
and stuff that attract pollinators,

08:25.129 --> 08:27.924
and then I've got some kale here,
it's Brassica oleracea.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.176
This black kale here is really lovely.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.220
It's got a great texture,
really good flavor.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.096
You want to try some?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.015
I'm good. Thank you.

08:36.098 --> 08:38.017
Actually, we came here to ask you

08:38.643 --> 08:41.312
why you quit your custodial job
at St. Bernardine.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.022
No, I didn't quit.

08:43.314 --> 08:47.318
No, I got transferred to St. B's
sister school, St. Mary's. [sniffles]

08:47.777 --> 08:49.987
-Transferred by who?
-Mrs. Wexler.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.490
But it's cool. I landed in the tall grass.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.700
I got a sweet little raise,
it's a faster commute.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.786
It's good vibes all around over there.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.120
Actually, we wanted to know

08:58.204 --> 09:00.498
exactly what happened on your last day,
December 4th.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.541
Oh, man.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.293
That was a disaster. [sniffles]

09:04.377 --> 09:06.462
It was a huge mess. [sniffles]

09:06.546 --> 09:07.463
How so?

09:09.298 --> 09:11.759
[Hot Janitor] It was teachers' lounge,
second period.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.553
Two people threw up that day.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.389
[Peter] How do you know it was two?

09:16.847 --> 09:20.935
Well, it was two piles of vomit
with different consistencies, you know?

09:21.018 --> 09:22.687
One yacked right into the plant.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.815
We tried to save it, but it died.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.650
And then the next one,

09:27.942 --> 09:30.236
they barfed right into the sink
next to the coffee station

09:30.319 --> 09:31.404
like it was urgent.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.781
Probably trying to keep a clean,
which I appreciate,

09:33.864 --> 09:37.076
except that cleaning throw up out
of a sink is harder than you might think.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.954
There's a lot of scooping involved
and it was chunky.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.372
So it got me thinking, you know,

09:41.455 --> 09:43.249
what could be making
these teachers throw up?

09:43.332 --> 09:44.959
And that's when I found it.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.628
It was like this half-eaten chocolate
on the floor.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.216
I'm pretty sure a teacher took a candy
out of the advent calendar,

09:52.758 --> 09:55.511
but what was inside wasn't nougat

09:55.595 --> 09:56.679
and it wasn't caramel.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.724
It was cat shit coated in chocolate.

10:00.016 --> 10:00.891
[Peter] Oh my God.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.643
I know, man.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.604
I know it was the advent calendar,

10:04.687 --> 10:07.189
'cause Mrs. Wexler had me
bleach the whole thing, man.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.860
[Peter] Wait, so, you only found
one piece of candy on the floor?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.362
-Yeah.
-And why were there two piles of throw up?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.740
It was probably, like,
a sympathy vomit, right?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.450
One person with a weak stomach,

10:17.533 --> 10:19.869
couldn't really handle the sound
or the smell or whatever

10:19.952 --> 10:21.537
and they started barfing, too.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.248
[Peter] Do you know who was in
the teachers' lounge at that time

10:24.332 --> 10:25.583
or who threw up?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.628
No, man, I have no idea.
I mean, I wasn't there.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.212
All I'm saying is

10:30.838 --> 10:32.214
a teacher ate cat shit.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.134
You know? Like, ate it.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.470
-Fuck, that's gross.
-Yeah.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.389
[Sam] These are the five teachers
that we're possibly looking into.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.391
Yes, because if you look
at their schedules,

10:42.475 --> 10:45.061
those were the five teachers
that were free during second period

10:45.144 --> 10:46.812
and could've been in the teachers' lounge.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.773
Which means that there are
five possible victims.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.236
[Sam] So which one of you ate shit? Hmm.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.823
[Peter] Mr. Bernstein and Mrs. Wallace

10:57.907 --> 11:02.453
were off-campus on the 4th of December
for an annual Kairos Retreat.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.082
That left three potential
shit-eating victims.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.626
But when speaking to those teachers,

11:09.126 --> 11:10.544
they didn't offer much help.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.255
Mr. Fernandez, does anything
about December 4th stand out to you

11:13.339 --> 11:14.674
for any particular reason?

11:15.883 --> 11:16.884
As far as I can recall,

11:16.967 --> 11:18.761
there wasn't anything special
about that day.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.096
December 4th...

11:20.805 --> 11:23.891
[inhales deeply, sighs]
To the best of my recollection,

11:23.974 --> 11:26.060
that was a pretty typical day.

11:26.143 --> 11:30.064
That was a long time ago,
but to the best of my memory,

11:30.147 --> 11:32.817
I don't remember
anything unusual happening. [inhales]

11:33.567 --> 11:36.445
So, all the teachers are claiming
that they don't remember

11:36.529 --> 11:40.324
anything happening
on December 4th that nothing stood out.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.119
"To the best of my recollection..." Um...

11:43.202 --> 11:45.204
"To the best of my knowledge,
nothing happened."

11:45.287 --> 11:48.666
They all are kind of using the same exact
kind of verbiage.

11:48.749 --> 11:50.209
They all sound like Mrs. Wexler

11:50.292 --> 11:52.628
from her initial email
that she sent to us a while back.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.840
[Peter] Is it a coincidence
that all three teachers

11:55.923 --> 11:59.135
used the same non-committal language
that Mrs. Wexler used

11:59.218 --> 12:01.429
when we asked her
about her meeting with Kevin?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.432
Wait, so you think Mrs. Wexler
is, you know, steering them?

12:04.515 --> 12:06.976
I mean, it's possible.
But there definitely was a fourth crime.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.564
Whether or not Wexler order a cover-up
is just speculation,

12:11.772 --> 12:14.650
but as much as the teachers
wanted us to believe that

12:14.734 --> 12:18.237
to the best of their memory,
December 4th was just a normal day,

12:18.863 --> 12:20.489
we know that's simply not true.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.409
The 4th wasn't an ordinary day,

12:23.868 --> 12:27.121
because the Turd Burglar
was threatening another crime.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.790
Yeah, I remember December 4th
because of that post.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.169
We were bracing for the worst,
waiting for another Turd Burglar attack.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.629
Honestly, I thought classes
would be canceled,

12:36.005 --> 12:38.507
but it was just treated like a normal day.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.343
I was low-key hoping
for a poop crime on the 4th

12:41.427 --> 12:44.513
because that's when are AP Calc
midterms were in Fernandez's class.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.391
Everyone in first period
said the test was impossible.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.394
So when no poop crime happened,
I was obviously annoyed.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.314
But we get to class and we had a sub.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.900
Fernandez left halfway through the day.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.319
[Peter] On December 4th,

12:58.694 --> 13:00.988
Fernandez leaves
right after second period,

13:01.489 --> 13:04.492
just before Hot Janitor
was called to clean up the mess.

13:05.242 --> 13:08.037
-[Peter whispers] Take it slow.
-[Sam] Just don't overthink it.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.789
[Peter, knocking] Mr. Fernandez?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.249
Hey, is it okay if we ask you
a few questions?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.168
Awesome. Thank you so much.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.714
So, um...

13:19.173 --> 13:21.425
we're just trying to figure out
exactly what took place

13:21.509 --> 13:23.093
in the school on December 4th,

13:23.177 --> 13:25.888
and in speaking with some of the faculty,

13:25.971 --> 13:27.139
we realized that--

13:27.223 --> 13:30.351
Actually, following the Turd Burglar's
Instagram posts, you could see--

13:30.434 --> 13:32.228
Mr. Fernandez, did you eat shit?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.484
No, I did not eat shit.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.529
I've told you, now,  I'm busy here, guys.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.822
I'm so sorry about that.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.699
-Sam had a bit too much coffee--
-I am busy, guys.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.743
-Okay, sorry about that.
-Get out!

13:47.827 --> 13:49.787
-[whispering] Fuck!
-[Sam] He totally ate shit.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.082
[Peter] If Fernandez really ate poop,

13:53.374 --> 13:54.708
why would he deny it?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.919
Wouldn't he want justice?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.880
How was the school keeping him quiet?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.049
And what did he have to gain?

14:02.466 --> 14:03.592
We had to wonder.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.847
Did the school find a way to buy loyalty
from Mr. Fernandez?

14:08.222 --> 14:11.600
Every year, a select group
of students and faculty

14:11.684 --> 14:15.521
embark on a Gifts of the Lamb trip
to Costa Rica.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.983
The kids do a lot of good
for the community.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.360
The first place we go is an orphanage,

14:21.443 --> 14:23.737
and you see little kids running around,
they got dirty feet.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.741
They got dirt floors
and, like, mud houses and stuff,

14:27.825 --> 14:30.911
and it's, like, it's kind of sad.
I mean, I was a little depressed for 'em.

14:31.245 --> 14:35.165
But then we left the poor people part,
and the hotel was crazy, like...

14:35.249 --> 14:36.792
Yo, the hotel was lit.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.669
[EDM music playing]

14:38.752 --> 14:42.756
[girl scoffs] It's a total joke. We spend,
like, two hours painting a shitty shack,

14:42.840 --> 14:45.050
and then we stay at this sick resort.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.928
[Mascot Boy] The hotel is ridiculous.

14:48.012 --> 14:48.929
[loud chatter]

14:49.054 --> 14:51.056
My parents won't pay for spring break,

14:51.390 --> 14:53.392
but they'll pay for Gifts of the Lamb.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.561
-[screaming]
-[blond girl] It's just as good.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.897
We help a lot of poor people out.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.148
[all] Charity, charity!

14:59.231 --> 15:00.900
And some of them
actually work at the hotel,

15:00.983 --> 15:02.568
so they kind of help us out too.

15:02.651 --> 15:04.904
You know, like,
cleaning towels and all that.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.823
[guy] I think we did
some really good things there,

15:08.282 --> 15:10.284
but I don't remember any of it.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.995
[guy #2]
All the guys on the team get to go.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.623
We gotta do a little charity work,
but then we can just kick back,

15:15.706 --> 15:17.249
watch porn in the Jacuzzi, straight up.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.459
It's dope, man.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.461
Every bathroom in the hotel
had a bidet, right?

15:20.544 --> 15:22.296
So, a bidet is like...

15:22.713 --> 15:25.341
you got your regular toilet,
then you got a bidet toilet.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.093
A bidet shoot, like,
a water stream up your ass.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.471
Now, it sound a little gay,

15:30.971 --> 15:31.972
but it's not at all.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.682
It's hella clean and it's hella tight.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.977
It's a vacation for everyone, yeah.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.812
You know, for the teachers, even.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.607
It's so popular.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.235
We literally hold a lottery to determine

15:45.319 --> 15:47.404
who lands the lucky spot as chaperone.

15:47.821 --> 15:48.656
[chuckles]

15:48.739 --> 15:50.449
We pretend it's not a big deal,

15:50.532 --> 15:53.953
but as soon as Mrs. Wexler decides
who it's gonna be,

15:54.036 --> 15:55.746
when she posts it on
that activities board,

15:55.829 --> 15:58.040
we are racing over to find out who won.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.418
[Peter] The Gifts of the Lamb trip
always features four chaperones.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.755
But this year, there was an exception.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.633
The selection process, quite frankly,

16:07.716 --> 16:10.052
is a little mysterious.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.763
I was bummed that my name
wasn't on the list,

16:13.055 --> 16:15.349
but neither was Mr. Fernandez.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.061
Then they revised the list,
and there he was.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.980
[Peter] So this is what I think happened.

16:21.563 --> 16:25.150
I think that Miss Wexler moved Hot Janitor

16:25.234 --> 16:27.528
an hour away to St. Mary's, right?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.905
-Moved him around like a rape-y priest.
-Exactly.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.949
Then all the teachers
that were in the lounge,

16:32.032 --> 16:34.576
she told them all to be quiet
and coached their responses.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.869
And then finally,

16:35.953 --> 16:38.747
she rigs the Gifts of the Lamb
retreat for Fernandez.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.709
Huh. Gave him a nice, free,
little vacation to keep his mouth shut.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.877
-Exactly.
-Well, almost free.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.671
-He did eat poop.
-Exactly.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.965
So, everyone who knew about the crime,

16:48.048 --> 16:49.717
she found a way to keep quiet.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.679
[stuttering] There is clear evidence
of a cover-up here, Sam.

16:54.638 --> 16:56.223
There has to be a fourth crime.

16:59.893 --> 17:04.648
Mr. Fernandez pulls a chocolate-covered
cat poop from the advent calendar

17:04.732 --> 17:06.775
-and eats it.
-[soft crunch]

17:07.651 --> 17:11.196
-He immediately throws up in the plant.
-[muffled barf]

17:11.280 --> 17:12.865
After seeing him vomit,

17:12.948 --> 17:17.244
either Mr. Gesualdi or Sister Ruth
throws up in the sink

17:18.287 --> 17:19.246
Shortly after,

17:19.329 --> 17:22.750
Hot Janitor gets called in
to clean up the mess.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.670
The school was under a lot of pressure
to find the Turd Burglar,

17:26.754 --> 17:29.048
and that all went away
when Kevin was arrested.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.426
Admitting that the Turd Burglar
was still at large

17:32.509 --> 17:34.470
and that Kevin's confession was forced,

17:34.803 --> 17:36.889
would have gotten Mrs. Wexler
and the school

17:36.972 --> 17:38.474
a lot of negative attention.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.101
Perhaps that's why this fourth crime

17:41.602 --> 17:43.103
was swept under the rug.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.022
There was a fourth crime.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.148
Precisely.

17:46.231 --> 17:50.194
Wexler knew
[stuttering] that there was a crime

17:50.486 --> 17:51.820
on December 4th.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.698
[Peter] It was a rare moment of hope
for Kevin.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.493
Vindication felt within reach.

17:57.826 --> 17:58.744
His freedom,

17:59.286 --> 18:01.413
his life outside house arrest,

18:01.997 --> 18:04.291
all of it felt so close.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.627
There is a chance the Horsehead Collective

18:06.710 --> 18:09.296
might be able to perform
at the Gilbert bar mitzvah.

18:09.379 --> 18:12.758
I was worried I'd have to decline
because of the ankle monitor but...

18:13.675 --> 18:16.386
Let's not ahead of ourselves yet.
We still have a lot of work to do.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.180
But I've seen this kind of hope before,

18:18.972 --> 18:21.183
and I know that without definitive proof,

18:22.101 --> 18:23.143
hope means nothing.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.523
We still needed confirmation
that a fourth poop crime happened.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.360
Obviously Mrs. Wexler declined
to sit down with us.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.278
But luckily,

18:33.737 --> 18:36.949
she does meet with students
during office hours.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.159
-Oh. That's okay.
-Sorry.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.579
-Say something for me.
-Hmm... Something.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.748
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.751
All right. And if you feel like
she's on to you at any moment

18:47.835 --> 18:49.837
and you feel uncomfortable
and you want to just bail,

18:49.920 --> 18:52.464
-we totally get it.
-Guys, I got this, okay?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.341
-All right.
-You got this.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.259
Yeah.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.260
[Peter mumbles]

18:56.927 --> 18:57.761
Okay.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.388
Good luck in there.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.976
[Chloe whispering] Can you guys hear me?

19:07.187 --> 19:08.355
I think she's on the phone.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.232
Oh, she's coming.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.650
-Hi, Chloe.
-Hi.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.402
-You have a schedule change?
-Yes. Hmm...

19:13.485 --> 19:14.945
-Come on in.
-All right, thanks.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.323
[Cathy] You can take a seat
right over there.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.534
I'll look up your transcript.
[clears throat]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.077
What's your conflict?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.164
[Chloe] Um... Well, I...

19:26.165 --> 19:27.666
Actually, Mrs. Wexler,

19:27.749 --> 19:29.793
I'm here to talk
about the teachers' lounge.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.337
I know there was a fourth
Turd Burglar crime.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.090
We know that Mr. Fernandez
left halfway through the day

19:35.174 --> 19:37.509
and that Hot Janitor found
a piece of cat poop on the floor--

19:37.593 --> 19:41.263
[Cathy] Does that have something to do
with adjusting your winter schedule?

19:41.346 --> 19:42.556
[Chloe] Well, I mean...

19:43.140 --> 19:46.018
So, if the crime happened in December,

19:46.768 --> 19:50.147
well, then it proves that Kevin
couldn't have done it, because--

19:50.230 --> 19:51.190
[Cathy] Chloe...

19:51.273 --> 19:53.066
[Chloe] Because he wasn't
on school grounds--

19:53.150 --> 19:55.944
[Cathy] Kevin confessed.
Okay? He confessed.

19:56.653 --> 20:00.324
[Chloe] But he couldn't have done it.
He was on house arrest by then,

20:00.407 --> 20:02.826
and it just proves he didn't do anything--

20:02.910 --> 20:05.329
[Cathy] Chloe...
Chloe, I'm not your enemy.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.706
But if a fourth crime occurred,

20:08.332 --> 20:10.542
it sounds like what you're telling me
is that...

20:11.126 --> 20:13.337
one of Kevin's friends helped him out.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.007
I don't think it's in
your best interest for us

20:17.090 --> 20:20.677
to start looking at who
might have conspired with him.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.224
[Chloe] Um...

20:25.641 --> 20:28.477
Is that a threat, Mrs. Wexler?

20:29.102 --> 20:30.896
[Cathy] You need to understand,

20:30.979 --> 20:33.649
these are felony charges
we're talking about, here.

20:34.733 --> 20:38.445
So you might want to rethink
having this conversation right now.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.657
Is that it?

20:45.285 --> 20:47.371
[thump, Kevin sighs]

20:48.413 --> 20:49.957
[Peter] Without definitive proof,

20:50.457 --> 20:51.500
hope means nothing.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.086
And Kevin realized

20:54.169 --> 20:57.506
that Mrs. Wexler wasn't going to give us
the confirmation we needed.

20:58.423 --> 20:59.591
Perhaps nobody was.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.009
[Kevin] Well, then it's over.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.887
And now I'm taking down the people
that I care about with me.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.308
-Oh my God.
-[Peter] I felt for Kevin.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.519
When your hopes are high,

21:11.353 --> 21:12.813
the fall is twice as hard.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.649
[Kevin] No one wants me back at school.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.360
-That's not true!
-It is, Peter.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.444
[crowd cheering]

21:19.528 --> 21:21.822
[Kevin] DeMarcus has the whole school
in his corner.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.200
I-I... [chuckles]

21:26.159 --> 21:27.327
I have no one.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.204
[slurping]

21:30.205 --> 21:33.750
Everybody sees me as this island.

21:35.252 --> 21:39.548
Like I don't need anything from anyone.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.387
I feel like I'm sinking.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.641
You know, I know I can be difficult.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.184
Amen!

21:52.144 --> 21:55.314
That's why my grandma's always
up my ass, and...

21:55.397 --> 21:56.523
[inhales deeply]

21:56.898 --> 21:58.567
probably why Wexler hates me.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.945
It's why my mom left, probably.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.615
[stuttering] It's... [sighs]

22:07.159 --> 22:09.286
It's been a hard couple of years, Peter.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.457
Oh!

22:13.957 --> 22:15.375
And worst of all,

22:15.459 --> 22:19.880
I now have to officially decline
the Gilbert bar mitzvah. Shit.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.508
Myles said there were gonna be
so many older cousins there.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.601
[footsteps, floor squeaking]

22:34.144 --> 22:35.729
[Chloe] Hey, the smell is gone.

22:38.899 --> 22:42.361
Oh, is this the Doomhammer
you were saving up for?

22:42.444 --> 22:43.278
It is.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.490
It'd be totally impractical
in actual combat,

22:46.573 --> 22:47.699
but whatever.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.203
Really? It's really heavy.
I feel like it could do a lot of damage.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.622
I regret the purchase.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.582
[sighs]

22:55.665 --> 22:58.377
I heard what you did, Chloe.

22:59.753 --> 23:03.382
And I appreciate the effort. It, uh...

23:03.465 --> 23:06.593
It... It-it was a "noble" effort.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.345
You're welcome.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.764
[sighs] I need you to stop.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.518
They made up their mind.
They're not going to change their mind.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.189
So, there's just no use
you going down with me.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.191
What?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.193
No, I'm, like...

23:24.111 --> 23:25.445
I'm not stopping.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.031
Come on, we are so close to exposing--

23:28.115 --> 23:30.117
We aren't, Chloe. [chuckles]

23:31.118 --> 23:32.994
And frankly, I don't really know

23:33.078 --> 23:36.373
why you're pretending to care so much
all of a sudden.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.626
-Kevin, we're friends.
-Are we?

23:40.127 --> 23:43.171
You haven't been here in months.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.590
Wow.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.927
Do you know what I've had to do for you?

23:49.344 --> 23:51.430
I called out DeMarcus for you.

23:51.638 --> 23:55.434
And now my teammates hate me
and I'm on Mrs. Wexler's shit list.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.351
[scoffs]

23:57.686 --> 23:58.520
Nothing?

23:59.604 --> 24:00.689
Okay.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.482
I'm gonna leave.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.318
Just have fun with your little
fucking pity party.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.487
At least I'm trying to help you.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.991
[footsteps departing]

24:13.410 --> 24:15.787
[crickets chirping]

24:15.871 --> 24:18.248
[phone line trilling]

24:22.252 --> 24:24.504
Hi, you've reached Peter Maldonado
of PM Productions.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.048
Please leave me a message
and I'll give you a call right back.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.801
[Kevin] Peter, it's Kevin.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.512
I've been thinking about
the teachers' lounge.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.432
My locker, B-542,

24:35.515 --> 24:38.268
it's directly across
from the teachers' lounge.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.605
The combination is 26-37-23.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.985
I thought that perhaps if you put
a camera inside of the locker

24:47.736 --> 24:49.654
that you could record

24:49.738 --> 24:52.741
the daily activity, the ins-and-outs,
of the teachers' lounge.

24:53.950 --> 24:56.953
Also, it occurred to me that

24:57.412 --> 25:01.041
I perhaps have seemed a tad bit ungrateful

25:01.124 --> 25:04.002
for what you've done, and Sam and Chloe,

25:04.085 --> 25:06.755
and that's not true.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.132
I am grateful.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.759
So, yeah.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.762
I hope that the vantage point
from my locker

25:13.845 --> 25:17.516
can be useful in your finding
the true Turd Burglar.

25:17.807 --> 25:21.811
[ominous music playing]
