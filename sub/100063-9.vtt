This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't snuck up on me.

01:12.321 --> 01:15.067
(SCOFFS) Are you actually
gonna blame me for this?

01:15.091 --> 01:17.236
Of course I am. You came out of nowhere,

01:17.260 --> 01:18.403
totally ninja'd me.

01:18.427 --> 01:19.576
That's why I dropped the bottle.

01:19.577 --> 01:21.288
A bottle you never should've
taken in the first place,

01:21.312 --> 01:22.489
because it doesn't belong to you.

01:22.513 --> 01:24.458
Yeah, but it wasn't for me.
It was for a client.

01:24.482 --> 01:25.926
You know the bodyguarding job?

01:25.950 --> 01:28.596
I was gonna wine and dine them...
eh, well, wine them anyway.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.344
I thought you'd be okay with it.

01:30.369 --> 01:31.413
And why would you think that?

01:31.437 --> 01:32.514
Because it was a big payday

01:32.538 --> 01:33.945
that would lead to more work.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.328
I mean, you're the one who told me

01:35.352 --> 01:37.319
that I got to start treating
what we do more like a business.

01:37.343 --> 01:38.653
Yes, but if you recall, Magnum,

01:38.677 --> 01:40.805
I didn't want you to pursue
that client in the first place,

01:40.829 --> 01:42.791
because we already have a job lined up.

01:42.815 --> 01:43.825
Yeah, but that was a probate case.

01:43.849 --> 01:45.397
It was a small little nothing job.

01:45.421 --> 01:47.257
The fee wouldn't have even paid for gas.

01:49.134 --> 01:51.166
Oh, my God.

01:51.190 --> 01:52.930
You didn't.

01:53.692 --> 01:55.070
What?

01:55.094 --> 01:59.074
Magnum, this was a '95 Chateau Saunière.

01:59.098 --> 02:00.809
Yeah. I heard it was pretty good.

02:00.833 --> 02:05.313
This bottle of wine costs $7,000.

02:05.337 --> 02:06.715
What?

02:06.739 --> 02:09.184
It's worth far more
than that job would ever pay.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.521
Okay, well, maybe we should
get the old Shop-Vac.

02:12.545 --> 02:15.257
- We can suck some of it up and...
- Are you for real?

02:15.281 --> 02:17.292
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle.

02:17.316 --> 02:19.361
You mean wine, but, yes,
it's-it's like when you drop

02:19.385 --> 02:21.630
a piece of food on the floor,
if the floor's clean,

02:21.654 --> 02:23.098
food's still good,
and this floor's clean.

02:23.122 --> 02:25.267
Are you referring
to the three-second rule?

Magnum, you need to get to
Kings Medical right away.

02:34.045 --> 02:35.146
Why? What happened?

02:35.171 --> 02:36.378
I was coming up from the hospital morgue

02:36.402 --> 02:37.712
when I saw paramedics wheel in

02:37.736 --> 02:39.314
your detective friend Harry Brown.

02:39.338 --> 02:40.816
Magnum, he's been shot.

(CLAMORING)

02:42.208 --> 02:45.080
- What? Okay.
- You need to get down here.

02:45.105 --> 02:47.689
- You better hurry.
- I'm on my way.

02:47.713 --> 02:51.359
- He's evasive. Got it.
- I want epinephrine now.

02:51.383 --> 02:52.861
Let's shock. Get the pads on him.

02:52.885 --> 02:55.686
- Pull up, and below 150.
- Everyone, clear.

03:04.697 --> 03:06.308
Hey.

03:06.332 --> 03:07.876
- Noelani.
- Hey.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.045
They stabilized him,
and he's in surgery now.

03:10.069 --> 03:11.613
They're doing everything that they can.

Look, I got to get back to

03:16.642 --> 03:18.223
You gonna be okay?

03:21.347 --> 03:22.757
Thanks.

03:22.781 --> 03:25.494
- So, any idea what happened?
- Still gathering info.

03:25.518 --> 03:28.218
He was found in a ditch
by a hiker out in Waimanalo.

03:29.255 --> 03:30.899
- Waimanalo?
- Yeah.

03:30.923 --> 03:33.235
That doesn't make sense. He was
supposed to be in Makakilo.

03:33.259 --> 03:34.411
How do you know that?

03:34.436 --> 03:35.604
HIGGINS: He was working
on a probate case.

03:35.628 --> 03:38.039
The lawyer from the estate
hired us, but we...

03:38.063 --> 03:39.674
But we handed the case off to Harry.

03:39.698 --> 03:42.177
Talked to him this morning,
he said he was following a lead.

03:42.201 --> 03:43.845
Well, CSU's at the scene right now,

03:43.869 --> 03:46.281
and based on tire tracks
and one set of footprints,

03:46.305 --> 03:47.716
it looks like an attempted body dump,

03:47.740 --> 03:51.186
so maybe Harry was in Makakilo
earlier, perp shot him,

03:51.210 --> 03:53.188
tossed him in the trunk,
then drove to Waimanalo.

03:53.212 --> 03:54.789
Well, any luck with Harry's phone?

03:54.813 --> 03:57.125
Wasn't on him. His car's missing, too.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.628
But after the docs remove
the slugs, we'll run ballistics.

03:59.652 --> 04:00.896
Hopefully, that'll get us a lead.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.564
Harry called me a couple hours ago,

04:02.588 --> 04:03.732
didn't leave a message.

04:03.756 --> 04:05.645
I figured he was just checking in, but...

04:06.355 --> 04:07.773
he was in trouble.

04:09.962 --> 04:12.752
Magnum, we can't yet be certain that this

04:12.776 --> 04:14.075
has anything to do with the probate case.

04:14.099 --> 04:16.144
You said it yourself... it's
a small nothing little case.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.879
But maybe I was wrong.

04:17.903 --> 04:20.803
Uh, maybe the person he was looking
for didn't want to be found.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.653
HPD will follow up
with the estate lawyer,

04:24.677 --> 04:26.755
get the name of the heir
Harry was looking for.

04:26.779 --> 04:28.685
- Can you text me the lawyer's info?
- Of course.

04:30.402 --> 04:33.295
Harry's retired HPD, one of our own.

04:33.319 --> 04:35.384
We'll catch whoever did this.

- Where's he going?
- Where do you think?

and it appears the developer
is still moving forward

04:59.475 --> 05:00.953
with plans for construction,

05:00.977 --> 05:04.156
showing little regard for the
site's cultural significance.

05:11.621 --> 05:14.266
They're blocking access
to the construction site,

05:14.290 --> 05:18.170
and guess who's leading the charge, huh?

05:18.194 --> 05:19.297
What's wrong?

05:20.229 --> 05:21.774
Harry Brown's been shot.

05:21.798 --> 05:23.809

He's in surgery, but the doctors
are saying it's-it's pretty bad.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.281
What the hell happened?

05:29.305 --> 05:30.949
It's a long story, but, look,

05:30.973 --> 05:33.018
Harry's car is missing,
and we need to find it.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.720
Could you call your buddy Kawika?

05:34.744 --> 05:36.555
He's got spotters all over
the island, right?

05:36.579 --> 05:38.129
- Yeah.
- Yeah, how about your friend

05:38.154 --> 05:39.193
who has the taxi cab company?

05:39.217 --> 05:40.292
Maybe he can have his guys
keep a lookout.

05:40.316 --> 05:42.461
Done. I also got a guy
who owns a tow truck service.

05:42.485 --> 05:45.731
Perfect. More eyes the better.
Look, this is...

05:45.755 --> 05:48.400
Harry's make and model,
license plate of his car.

05:48.424 --> 05:50.569
All right, I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.217
HIGGINS: I got into Harry's cloud.

06:05.241 --> 06:06.618
Not much there.

06:06.642 --> 06:08.687
He did take some photos
in the last eight hours.

06:08.711 --> 06:10.856
They uploaded automatically,
but they're pretty mundane.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.691
There's two pictures of his dog

06:12.715 --> 06:15.794
and one of a children's pink bicycle.

06:15.818 --> 06:17.129
I guess it's his granddaughter's.

06:17.153 --> 06:19.178
- So we have nothing.
- Well,

06:19.203 --> 06:22.244
not quite. Gordon texted.
HPD has spoken to the lawyer.

06:22.325 --> 06:25.537
The estate belonged to an Alfred Waiola,

06:25.561 --> 06:27.172
and the heir that Harry was looking for

06:27.196 --> 06:29.041
was a man by the name of Kenny McCoy.

06:29.065 --> 06:30.609
- HPD looking for him?
- Yeah,

06:30.633 --> 06:32.377
but they're also considering
the possibility

06:32.401 --> 06:35.347
that Harry may have been targeted.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.683
By someone he put away?

06:37.707 --> 06:39.551
Yeah. They're looking
into people he's caught

06:39.575 --> 06:41.675
who have been released recently.

06:41.699 --> 06:44.679
They think maybe someone
wanted their pound of flesh.

06:46.782 --> 06:48.694
You can't blame yourself, you know.

06:49.123 --> 06:50.756
Why not?

06:51.988 --> 06:55.467
Look, in our line of work,

06:55.491 --> 06:57.536
cases get passed on all the time.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.105
I mean, it wasn't that long ago
that Harry passed on one to you.

07:00.129 --> 07:01.740
Yeah, because of a health issue.

07:01.764 --> 07:03.542
It's not like we gave him the job

07:03.566 --> 07:06.011
because we were too busy helping someone.

07:06.035 --> 07:08.620
I was chasing a payday,
and because of that,

07:10.664 --> 07:11.906
Harry could die.

TC, you really didn't have to come here.

Uh, I didn't sit out here
all Halloween night

just for the heiau to get destroyed.

It's so nice to see you here.

After hearing you talk
about what was happening,

08:03.426 --> 08:04.970
I wanted to come support you.

08:04.994 --> 08:07.739
Oh, mahalo.

08:07.763 --> 08:09.241
I-I did some more research,

08:09.265 --> 08:12.044
and I understand now
how sacred these places are

08:12.068 --> 08:13.979
and why we have to protect them.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.364
Any luck? Yeah, one of his guys

08:32.388 --> 08:34.700
spotted Harry's car
in a parking lot downtown.

08:34.724 --> 08:36.335
So, whoever did this

08:36.359 --> 08:38.537
dumped the car; thereafter,
they tried to dispose of Harry.

08:38.561 --> 08:41.794
- Yeah. Thanks, Rick.
- (PHONE BEEPS)

08:44.133 --> 08:46.278
This isn't the way downtown.

08:46.302 --> 08:48.762
No, I figured I'd stop
by Harry's place first.

08:49.438 --> 08:51.338
There's someone who should
be there when he wakes up.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.450
That's Harry's car.

09:08.224 --> 09:10.035
Stay.

09:10.059 --> 09:12.493
Ah, look at that.
He listens better than you do.

09:34.128 --> 09:35.728
Higgins.

09:38.026 --> 09:39.992
It's fresh blood.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.401
It's got to be Harry's.

09:42.425 --> 09:46.226
So they used his own car
to move his body to Waimanalo.

10:02.912 --> 10:04.656
Harry's six-two.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.259
This seat is way too close
to the steering wheel.

10:07.283 --> 10:09.361
Whoever drove this car
has got to be at least

10:09.385 --> 10:11.136
six inches shorter.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.655
Oh, Magnum.

10:17.626 --> 10:19.304
Inside the seat is a rather strange place

10:19.328 --> 10:20.939
to keep a cell phone, don't you think?

10:20.963 --> 10:22.808
Maybe they planted it there
as a tracking device.

10:22.832 --> 10:24.109
I've done it before.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.745
If somebody was following Harry,
maybe he was targeted.

10:26.769 --> 10:29.247
Whoever's responsible for this
isn't very good.

10:29.271 --> 10:31.283
Firstly, they don't make sure
that Harry's actually dead,

10:31.307 --> 10:33.385
and secondly, they leave
a cell phone in the car.

10:33.409 --> 10:34.586
It's amateur hour.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.923
Hopefully, it'll make it
easier to track them.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.720
The doctor I had to go through
filed a complaint.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.222
How much trouble do you think you're in?

37:37.246 --> 37:38.523
Not sure yet.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.659
But between that and
assaulting Tony Zhao recently,

37:40.683 --> 37:42.883
I'm probably looking at
a disciplinary hearing.

37:44.019 --> 37:45.997
- Sorry to hear that.
- You should be.

37:46.021 --> 37:47.521
The way I see it, it's all your fault.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.068
How do you figure?

37:50.092 --> 37:51.603
Well, before you came into my life,

37:51.627 --> 37:53.538
my professional record was spotless.

37:53.562 --> 37:56.074
Now crossing the line
has become a regular thing.

37:56.098 --> 37:57.709
You're saying I'm a bad influence on you?

37:57.733 --> 37:59.177
That's what I'm saying.

37:59.594 --> 38:02.347
But when we have outcomes like today,

38:02.371 --> 38:03.904
I guess I can't really complain.

38:07.109 --> 38:12.124
♪ Through the smoke, through the fire ♪

38:12.148 --> 38:14.982
♪ Just to save me ♪

38:20.122 --> 38:23.524
♪ I was down to the wire ♪

38:25.161 --> 38:27.828
♪ And then you came for me ♪

38:34.970 --> 38:38.250
♪ Through the smoke, through the fire ♪

38:38.274 --> 38:40.941
♪ Just to save... ♪

38:42.978 --> 38:46.858
So... she told you
everything that happened?

38:46.882 --> 38:48.260
Yeah. Yeah.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.061
Isabella invited Peyton to hang out

38:50.085 --> 38:51.563
at the park with some friends,

38:51.587 --> 38:54.199
and she started to feel sick,
so she went home early.

38:54.223 --> 38:57.502
She was running a fever,
so Melinda ran her a bath,

38:57.526 --> 38:58.737
gave her some medicine.

38:58.761 --> 39:01.973
She ended up passing out
in the bath and drowning.

39:01.997 --> 39:03.975
Oh, God.

39:03.999 --> 39:06.812
So my guess is, at that point,
Melinda panicked.

39:06.836 --> 39:08.914
Well, she was the only one
with Peyton at the time,

39:08.938 --> 39:11.049
and in her paranoia, she
thought she would get blamed,

39:11.073 --> 39:13.685
so she decided to cover it up.

39:13.709 --> 39:16.454
Eventually, over time,
she started to hear voices,

39:16.478 --> 39:19.758
and these voices blamed Isabella.

39:19.782 --> 39:22.060
So she grabbed her and-and what?

39:22.084 --> 39:24.262
Was gonna her until
she gave up the truth?

39:24.286 --> 39:25.397
Which was never gonna happen.

39:25.421 --> 39:27.299
I mean, this was all in her head.

39:27.932 --> 39:30.001
But eventually, the symptoms subsided,

39:30.025 --> 39:33.972
and she realized the-the
horrible mistake she made.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.975
Right, but she was in too deep
with no way out.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.177
She knew that if she came forward,

39:39.201 --> 39:41.479
she'd end up in prison for life.

39:41.503 --> 39:43.548
She was never gonna hurt this girl.

39:43.572 --> 39:46.051
But she couldn't let
her go, either, so...

39:46.075 --> 39:47.507
she held her.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.923
That's the craziest story
I've ever heard, Thomas.

39:51.947 --> 39:54.125
And believe me, I've heard them all.

39:54.149 --> 39:56.061
Yeah.

39:56.085 --> 39:57.829
Definitely one for the books.

39:58.665 --> 40:00.498
Oh, and, um... (CHUCKLES)

40:00.522 --> 40:04.369
turns out the neighbor behind
Melinda's house, Kenny McCoy,

40:04.393 --> 40:05.971
he actually was the heir,

40:05.995 --> 40:07.539
so you solved

40:07.563 --> 40:09.708
two cases, all from a hospital bed.

40:09.732 --> 40:11.698
(CHUCKLING): Yeah, right.

40:16.564 --> 40:18.431
Harry...

40:20.709 --> 40:22.053
I'm sorry.

40:22.077 --> 40:25.457
Kid... please.

40:25.481 --> 40:28.493
I was meant to be there to see that bike.

40:28.517 --> 40:30.362
Now, you call it fate,

40:30.386 --> 40:33.198
call it destiny,
call it whatever you want.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.367
But old Harry was meant to be there.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.957
I truly believe that.

40:42.564 --> 40:44.564
♪ ♪

40:55.311 --> 40:56.777
(HIGGINS CLEARS THROAT)

40:59.448 --> 41:01.726
(CHUCKLES) Can you wear
a bell or something?

41:01.750 --> 41:03.595
Have you not learned anything
from the last time

41:03.619 --> 41:04.729
I caught you down here?

41:04.753 --> 41:07.966
Yes. I have learned,
and I'm not stealing.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.267
I'm replacing.

41:09.291 --> 41:10.634
I beg your pardon?

41:10.658 --> 41:12.871
You know the bottle you
broke... I-I got a new one.

41:12.895 --> 41:15.707
Okay, firstly, that was not my fault.

41:15.731 --> 41:18.009
And secondly, you're telling me

41:18.033 --> 41:19.978
you replaced a $7,000 bottle of wine?

41:20.002 --> 41:21.902
I find that a little hard to believe.

41:22.938 --> 41:24.049
See for yourself.

41:24.886 --> 41:26.986
Yeah.

41:29.912 --> 41:31.222
(CHUCKLING): Okay.

41:31.246 --> 41:34.359
How did you afford this bottle of wine?

41:34.383 --> 41:36.928
Did you sell an organ?

41:36.952 --> 41:38.096
(CHUCKLING): No.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.898
Rick hooked me up with his wine supplier.

41:39.922 --> 41:41.466
He sold it to me for wholesale.

41:41.490 --> 41:45.003
It's still a small fortune,
but I'm making payments,

41:45.027 --> 41:47.472
and I'm gonna do it.

41:47.496 --> 41:49.507
Hmm.

41:49.531 --> 41:51.776
Well, maybe
this lucrative bodyguarding job

41:51.800 --> 41:54.179
will lead to more work
and you can pay it off

41:54.203 --> 41:55.280
sooner than you thought.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.815
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

41:56.839 --> 41:58.883
After I went to investigate
Harry's shooting,

41:58.907 --> 42:00.885
the client picked somebody else.

42:00.909 --> 42:02.687
I see.

42:02.711 --> 42:03.888
Tough break.

42:03.912 --> 42:05.156
Yeah.

42:05.180 --> 42:06.424
You know,

42:06.448 --> 42:09.427
you look like you could use

42:09.451 --> 42:11.896
a glass of wine right about now.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.631
No. After this ordeal, I honestly...

42:13.655 --> 42:15.567
I think I've learned my lesson.

42:15.591 --> 42:17.581
(CHUCKLES)

42:17.606 --> 42:18.616
Doubtful.

42:21.030 --> 42:22.674
This...

42:22.698 --> 42:24.576
is a 2012 Charles Baudet.

42:24.600 --> 42:27.645
Same terroir,
similar minerality and depth,

42:27.669 --> 42:30.382
but considerably less expensive

42:30.406 --> 42:32.117
than the bottle that you broke.

42:32.141 --> 42:33.752
Now, hold on.
So you're gonna help yourself

42:33.776 --> 42:36.287
- to one of Robin's wines?
- Mm-hmm.

42:36.311 --> 42:38.757
(CHUCKLING): That is very
un-Higgins-like of you.

42:38.781 --> 42:41.960
I mean, I guess your boorish behavior

42:41.984 --> 42:43.283
is rubbing off on me.

42:44.319 --> 42:46.531
I guess I am a bad influence.

42:46.555 --> 42:48.433
That you are.
