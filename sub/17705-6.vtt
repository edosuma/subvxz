For reasons I don't pretend

03:14.500 --> 03:15.709
you were stripped

03:53.209 --> 03:54.876
is that it?

- Why do you give a shit

03:54.918 --> 03:56.751
about those men?

03:56.792 --> 04:00.083
- Because it's an opportunity.

03:56.792 --> 04:00.083
Earn their loyalty.

04:01.876 --> 04:04.667
With their support as well

04:49.751 --> 04:52.125

04:53.209 --> 04:55.792

04:57.751 --> 05:01.042
Christ, if you're seen...

05:03.918 --> 05:07.292

you do not need to do it.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.334
Wait! Benton will self destruct.

06:09.626 --> 06:13.167
We have to get to Fort James

06:09.626 --> 06:13.167

This is a token

13:11.834 --> 13:14.292

13:26.209 --> 13:28.834

- Not until we have

13:30.876 --> 13:33.584
an understanding.

13:33.626 --> 13:35.584
- Well, an understanding

13:33.626 --> 13:35.584
requires

13:35.626 --> 13:37.626
that I see what I might buy.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.209
- You put me a great risk, sir,

13:37.667 --> 13:40.209
by coming here.

13:41.834 --> 13:44.209
- A woman of your enterprise,

13:41.834 --> 13:44.209
I assumed had protection.

13:45.250 --> 13:48.167
A redcoat perhaps, hiding

13:45.250 --> 13:48.167
underneath your skirts?

13:48.209 --> 13:49.876
In fact, we should present

13:48.209 --> 13:49.876
ourselves

13:49.918 --> 13:51.792
at the Governor's House,

13:49.918 --> 13:51.792
should we not?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.292
- Yes, sir.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.292
- Yes.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.876
- What business do you have

13:54.709 --> 13:56.876
with Lord Benton?

13:56.918 --> 13:59.250
- None. Never met the man.

13:59.292 --> 14:01.292
Simply a courtesy.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.000
- My proposal was confidential.

14:06.542 --> 14:10.292
Can I trust you to be discrete?

14:06.542 --> 14:10.292

14:10.334 --> 14:13.667
for a woman in your position

14:10.334 --> 14:13.667
is paramount.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.500
There's been a development.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.083
- What sort of development?

20:34.125 --> 20:36.709
- I sent a letter to Montreal

20:34.125 --> 20:36.709
offering to sell Samuel Grant

20:36.751 --> 20:38.834
our stolen furs.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.834
- A letter?

20:38.876 --> 20:42.000
Without informing me?

20:38.876 --> 20:42.000
- The issue is that he's here.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.834
At the Fort.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.834
- Ah, Jesus Christ!

20:44.876 --> 20:46.459
- He showed up with some thug.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.042
They're over at the Governor's

20:46.500 --> 20:48.042
House right now.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.709

20:48.083 --> 20:50.709
keeping your schemes from me.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.751

20:51.876 --> 20:54.751
what they're talking about.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.334
- Fine.

21:01.709 --> 21:05.209
I've been thinking about

21:01.709 --> 21:05.209
what you said this morning.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.375
- And?

21:07.417 --> 21:10.000
- And I've had a revelation

21:07.417 --> 21:10.000
about what should happen

21:10.042 --> 21:11.792
once Benton's gone.

21:11.834 --> 21:14.083
- And what's that?

21:15.584 --> 21:19.042
- You are to become

21:15.584 --> 21:19.042
the new Governor's wife.

21:19.083 --> 21:22.292
A marriage would be good

21:19.083 --> 21:22.292
for business. No more secrets.

21:22.334 --> 21:25.626
We can plot our next steps

21:22.334 --> 21:25.626
without fear of discovery.

21:27.542 --> 21:30.083
And...

21:30.125 --> 21:32.334
perhaps, in-in time,

21:33.500 --> 21:36.542

21:33.500 --> 21:36.542
