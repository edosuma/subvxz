00:01.301 --> 00:03.502
<i>Thanks for
downloading this fox show.</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.738
<i>And don't miss
all-new episodes on fox.</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:08.807
<i>Previously on sleepy hollow...</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:12.644
Hey, demon! To hell,
from whence you came.

00:12.646 --> 00:13.779
No!

00:15.016 --> 00:15.981
Dreyfuss, it's over!

00:15.983 --> 00:16.949
<i>I ask this great stone</i>

00:16.951 --> 00:19.351
<i>to transform to the elixir</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:21.120
<i>of everliving life.</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:26.525
A witness is no different
from any other person.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.659
Except that
they're a monster magnet.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.661
You can try
and deny what's happening,

00:29.663 --> 00:31.330
<i>and sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to you.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:32.631
<i>And Molly, too.</i>

00:32.633 --> 00:33.966
<i>The only thing I have to do</i>

00:33.968 --> 00:36.201
<i>is protect my daughter.</i>

01:00.995 --> 01:02.661
Hey, Manny.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.436
Sorry it took me so long
to come visit.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.587
Hello?

01:28.589 --> 01:29.721
Is someone there?

01:38.732 --> 01:41.667
<i>You ready to smash?</i>

01:42.902 --> 01:46.238
<i>Try that again, bud.</i>

01:46.240 --> 01:48.640
I believe I shall.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.910
Picked up a new friend?

01:51.912 --> 01:54.413
That would be captain beast,

01:54.415 --> 01:57.049
stalwart commander
of the smash force.

01:57.051 --> 01:59.618
"Help captain beast
and his smash force teammates

01:59.620 --> 02:03.155
defend the galaxy
from the forces of evil."

02:04.090 --> 02:05.924
"Collect all five."

02:05.926 --> 02:08.393
I marvel
at these wondrous items.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.497
Dolls that speak,
robots that transform,

02:11.499 --> 02:13.932
putty that... is silly.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.568
In my day, all we had
to entertain ourselves

02:16.570 --> 02:18.604
was a wooden hoop and a stick.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.306
And woe the day the stick broke.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.612
Shopping for an 11-year-old
is surprisingly difficult.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.615
Too old for kiddie toys,
too young for teen stuff.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.251
It's an awkward age.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.786
More awkward for her than most.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.456
If you refer to miss
Molly's role as a witness,

02:37.458 --> 02:40.192
'tis undeniable.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.927
Her position is unique.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.762
I've been thinking.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.997
I know she's the witness,

02:44.999 --> 02:46.798
but what if I...

02:46.800 --> 02:48.300
Fight the monsters for her?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.801
Like a designated hitter.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.637
I'll do exactly
what I have been doing.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.971
It's been working so far.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.941
There must be a reason
there are only two witnesses.

02:55.943 --> 02:59.278
Your role is as parent,
not as her second.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.116
Special agent Diana Thomas.

03:04.118 --> 03:07.386
When did this happen?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.188
I'll be there in 20.

03:09.190 --> 03:12.824
Virginia state troopers
just called in a body

03:12.826 --> 03:14.526
at Arlington national cemetery.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.196
That's dod land,
which makes the case federal.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.498
Very well.
Attend to your duties, agent.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.966
I shall continue alone.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.501
Are you sure?

03:22.503 --> 03:25.537
Yes. Balloons, hats,
festive things.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.306
Remember that Jake and Alex

03:27.308 --> 03:29.041
are stuck
at dhs skills training,

03:29.043 --> 03:30.509
so they're not coming
to the party.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.510
What about Jenny?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.645
She has every intention.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.982
She is still rummaging through
rubble in sleepy hollow.

03:36.984 --> 03:40.319
But miss Jenny knows
as well as I

03:40.321 --> 03:42.554
that evil tends to flare up

03:42.556 --> 03:45.090
just when you think
it's been extinguished.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.744
There you are, demon.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.282
Damn it.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.804
What you doing?

05:38.806 --> 05:41.373
No way... nothing.

05:42.442 --> 05:45.310
In here?
I was looking for a coat.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.512
Not this coat. A misplaced coat.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.548
Maybe it's behind
all those birthday presents

05:49.550 --> 05:50.882
you just stashed.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.652
Birthday?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.454
Birthday presents, um...

05:55.456 --> 05:58.557
It's okay. I won't tell mom.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.661
I need some help with homework.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.396
How are you with history?

06:07.133 --> 06:09.167
What the founding fathers
were seeking to achieve

06:09.169 --> 06:12.003
was nothing short of
the grandest social experiment

06:12.005 --> 06:13.839
in the history of mankind...

06:13.841 --> 06:15.841
The formation of a government

06:15.843 --> 06:18.076
free from the tyrannical rule
of kings.

06:18.078 --> 06:22.013
One that gains all its power,
all its scope

06:22.015 --> 06:25.317
from the simplest,
yet most profound, of concepts:

06:25.319 --> 06:28.320
"We the people."

06:31.023 --> 06:34.025
Sorry.
What was the question again?

06:34.027 --> 06:36.027
How many colonies were there?

06:36.029 --> 06:38.296
Right. 13.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.602
You sure know a lot
about history.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.339
You could say
it is my life's work.

06:47.341 --> 06:49.274
Well, what about
being a witness?

06:51.043 --> 06:53.345
Mom told me that's what we were.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.549
Well, your mother is correct.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.551
That is what we are.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.119
What's that mean?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.888
I mean, she told me that

07:02.890 --> 07:04.389
people will be counting on us

07:04.391 --> 07:05.891
and that we're supposed
to help people.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.225
All true.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.795
How are we supposed to do that
and why us?

07:09.797 --> 07:12.697
These are good questions
and important questions.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.800
But they are questions

07:14.802 --> 07:17.169
best discussed
when your mother is present.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.080
I know you are eager
to learn more.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.951
Think of us as explorers.

07:32.953 --> 07:37.556
Akin to Christopher Columbus
seeking out the new world.

07:37.558 --> 07:41.259
Now, all he had to go on
were his instincts...

07:41.261 --> 07:46.097
The belief that he was heading
in the right direction.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.599
That's what we must do.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.234
Trust our instincts?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.569
Of course.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.937
Always.

07:54.575 --> 07:58.143
We will continue this when
your mother returns. Agreed?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.965
Yes?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.032
Can I help you?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.300
Diana home?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.769
Who may I ask is calling?

08:24.771 --> 08:27.005
An old friend.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.375
Vic was a local kid,

08:30.377 --> 08:31.376
visiting her brother's grave.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.611
No eyewitnesses.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.011
At first, I thought it
was an animal attack,

08:34.014 --> 08:36.615
but then I saw the severe
ossification of the wound site.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.986
Is that... stone?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.120
That's what I'm talking about.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.655
The entire chest cavity,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.290
it's as if it's been petrified.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.025
But naturally
occurring petrifaction

08:47.027 --> 08:48.860
takes millions of years.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.896
Guess we can

08:50.898 --> 08:52.163
rule it out as
"naturally occurring."

08:52.165 --> 08:53.164
I guess.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.034
But I don't know
what that leaves.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.537
How about
supernaturally occurring?

09:02.509 --> 09:04.976
Speak of the devil.
I was just gonna call you.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.912
Got something here
I need you see.

09:06.914 --> 09:11.483
<i>Oddly enough, I was
about to say the same thing.</i>

09:13.754 --> 09:15.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is this thing?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.821
A hoverboard, a
birthday present.

09:16.823 --> 09:19.190
Or a one-way ticket
to a broken neck.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.659
Come on,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.494
let her live a little.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.831
You'll never know what she can
handle unless you let her try.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.200
I will decide what my daughter
can and can't handle.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.635
Our daughter.

09:33.105 --> 09:36.308
Sorry. Look,
let's try this again.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.879
Hi.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.847
It's good to see you, Dee.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.623
I can't believe how
big she's gotten.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.892
That's what kids do,
they grow up.

10:27.894 --> 10:31.763
Yeah, I've been meaning
to check in more.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.264
Two years.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.433
It's been two years
since she's seen you, Mitch.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.602
I know, but it's not like
I could just pop over

10:37.604 --> 10:38.903
from Afghanistan
for the weekend.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.071
You know how it is.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.239
I know.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.441
So does Molly.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.644
She doesn't expect much
from her dad anymore, so...

10:45.646 --> 10:47.612
Ouch. All I meant is

10:47.614 --> 10:50.482
I've made it a point
not to get her hopes up,

10:50.484 --> 10:54.285
so she's gotten used to the idea
of not having you around.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.587
I get it.

10:55.589 --> 10:56.688
You've always been very clear

10:56.690 --> 10:57.756
that you're doing this
by yourself.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.790
It's been tough,

10:58.792 --> 11:01.860
but I don't really let
myself think about it.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.732
I've missed you, too.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.641
So how long are you in town?

11:16.643 --> 11:18.943
Tbd.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.179
Thought I'd take a little time
before deciding what's next.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.280
You didn't re-up?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.616
It's time for a change.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.819
Had a couple of close calls
the last go-around.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.622
Made me reevaluate
my priorities.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.658
Top of that list
were you and Molly.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.193
Mitch, I... Nope.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.195
Before you say anything,

11:37.197 --> 11:40.732
just know that I think
you're an amazing mom.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.134
I respect how hard
you've had to work,

11:43.136 --> 11:44.803
and I don't want
to mess that up.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.172
I just want to...

11:47.174 --> 11:49.407
Want to take you out
for pizza now and then.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.409
Maybe catch a movie.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.511
Or just sit around all afternoon
watching cartoons.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.146
I mean, you know me,

11:55.148 --> 11:56.414
I love cartoons.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.416
I am immature that way.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.855
And I'm not here to get in the
way of you and your boyfriend.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.690
Okay? I'll give you guys
all the space you need.

12:05.692 --> 12:06.691
Boyfriend? Crane?

12:06.693 --> 12:07.859
No, he is not my boyfriend.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.160
Really?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.462
No.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.700
Miss Molly

12:15.702 --> 12:16.935
is quite the athlete.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.036
Mom?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.070
Suzie just texted.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.371
They're almost here. Okay.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.940
Clara's gonna pick you up
from soccer.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.208
Do you have your water bottle?

12:23.210 --> 12:25.543
Water. Great.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.513
Hey, kiddo,
it's great seeing you.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.949
Maybe next time we can
hang out a little longer.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.884
Maybe catch some
Scooby and shaggy.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.619
Who are Scooby and shaggy?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.087
Who's Scooby and shaggy?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.389
You're killing me,
I got a lot to teach you.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.392
Hey, are you gonna be
at my birthday party?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.228
Well, that's...

12:43.230 --> 12:45.797
That's really up to...

12:47.399 --> 12:49.567
Yeah, he'll be there.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.735
Cool.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.036
See you later, dad.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.276
Can I buy you a coffee later?

13:07.553 --> 13:09.387
If I may inquire,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.990
who are Scooby and shaggy?

13:14.894 --> 13:17.262
These wards,

13:17.264 --> 13:21.432
they will not hold me forever.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.101
They'll hold you long enough.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.104
You caught me by surprise
during our last battle.

13:26.106 --> 13:30.141
That will not happen again!

13:30.143 --> 13:33.645
I don't need to
surprise you this time.

13:33.647 --> 13:37.615
Just to figure out
your weakness.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.450
All you hellspawn have one.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.187
Good luck with that.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.790
Warriors greater than you
have tried.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.192
I'm sure they have.

13:47.194 --> 13:50.895
But you see, I'm not a warrior.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.431
I'm a demon killer.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.139
Grand title.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.809
You are...

14:04.811 --> 14:07.045
Experienced

14:07.047 --> 14:09.714
in the ways of demons.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.884
You have had a demon

14:12.886 --> 14:14.485
invade your body,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.721
control...

14:16.723 --> 14:18.323
Your soul.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.192
Be one with you.

14:31.637 --> 14:34.672
Just as a lion knows
when another pride

14:34.674 --> 14:37.542
has tainted his prey.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.786
You're trying to goad me
into making a mistake.

14:50.756 --> 14:54.158
But it's not gonna happen.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.999
We beat you and your boss,
and it wasn't even close.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.201
So you think you've defeated us?

15:03.203 --> 15:06.871
Well, let's see.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.340
The philosopher's stone
is destroyed,

15:09.342 --> 15:11.442
you are my prisoner,

15:11.444 --> 15:13.177
and what's left of
Malcolm dreyfuss

15:13.179 --> 15:15.380
couldn't fill a shoebox, so...

15:15.382 --> 15:17.882
Yeah, I'm chalking one up
in the "w" column.

15:17.884 --> 15:21.019
So you think Malcolm is dead?

15:25.291 --> 15:28.126
What do you know?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.230
<i>I always said</i>

15:32.232 --> 15:34.732
I was not gonna get involved
with another marine.

15:34.734 --> 15:39.137
Being a woman in that
environment is tough enough.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.738
But with Mitch and me...

15:40.740 --> 15:43.708
I mean, we couldn't have even
stopped it if we wanted to.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.476
Well, you're fortunate.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.313
That kind of passion
is most rare.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.647
Passion's one thing.

15:49.649 --> 15:53.117
Having a future
together is another.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.752
It's hard to plan
when you don't know

15:54.754 --> 15:56.587
where your next deployment's
gonna take you.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.489
Which is why you never wed.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.825
Never even talked about it.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.593
And when I got pregnant,

16:02.595 --> 16:06.230
I decided I needed to go
back to civilian life.

16:06.232 --> 16:10.068
Mitch and I weren't
exactly an option.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.241
He helps out financially.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.143
Calls, when he remembers.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.845
That's how it's always been.

16:20.847 --> 16:21.946
I'm fine with it.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.450
And is Molly "fine with it"?

16:25.452 --> 16:26.851
Of course.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.619
Good.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.188
What?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.856
No, nothing.

16:33.459 --> 16:36.461
Far be it from me to say.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.664
All I know is I was
not there for my son,

16:39.666 --> 16:43.034
and it haunted him
for a very long time.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.772
And another thing...

16:47.774 --> 16:49.974
Your connection with Mitch

16:49.976 --> 16:54.645
will not wane simply because
one of you has moved on.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.481
If I didn't know any better,

16:56.483 --> 17:00.151
I'd think you were trying to get
me and Mitch back together.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.719
Hardly.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.554
I'm acutely aware
of the consequences

17:03.556 --> 17:05.323
of leaving certain
things unresolved.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.224
Particularly matters of the...

17:08.727 --> 17:11.162
heart.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.531
Astonishing.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.468
It's as if all
the organic matter

17:17.470 --> 17:19.971
has been drained
from this one area.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.839
The effect is localized
to her chest.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.407
The rest of her body is intact.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.544
Human heart energy
is a rich, coveted target

17:26.546 --> 17:28.012
for a host of creatures.

17:28.013 --> 17:29.414
Succubi,

17:29.416 --> 17:30.648
vetala...

17:30.650 --> 17:32.150
Two other bodies
have been reported.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.352
Wait.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.021
Young girls. Same markings.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.157
Though the time of deaths
predate our victim.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.025
The second was killed
near Philly a day ago.

17:41.027 --> 17:45.029
The first was discovered...

17:45.031 --> 17:46.464
Outside sleepy hollow.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.669
So, you think this thing
that's killing these girls

17:51.671 --> 17:53.538
originated in sleepy hollow?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.173
And is now coming to D.C.?

17:55.175 --> 17:58.342
That is what evidence suggests.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.711
When did the first
incident happen?

18:00.713 --> 18:01.879
Three days ago.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.514
Shortly after
we defeated dreyfuss

18:03.516 --> 18:05.116
and destroyed
the philosopher's stone.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.119
Crane,

18:08.121 --> 18:10.188
I think dreyfuss is alive.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.956
He survived the explosion?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.858
<i>He may have done more
than just survive.</i>

18:13.860 --> 18:15.126
<i>The philosopher's stone
is the most</i>

18:15.128 --> 18:17.028
powerful artifact ever known.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.564
It can transmute lead into gold,

18:19.566 --> 18:20.798
life into death...

18:20.800 --> 18:23.000
Man into monster.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.205
'Tis possible he fell victim to

18:27.207 --> 18:31.742
a consequence
of the artifact's power.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.977
Which means...

18:32.979 --> 18:36.881
Malcolm dreyfuss
is the monster we seek.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.454
We must determine exactly
what form dreyfuss has taken.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.756
Now, the regular intervals
between attacks

18:45.758 --> 18:48.159
would suggest some kind
of feeding pattern.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.496
There were slash marks in
the edge of the chest cavity.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.498
That's consistent
with claws of some kind.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.933
Which would suggest
the beast we seek

18:55.935 --> 18:57.101
is of the lycan variety.

18:57.103 --> 19:01.472
Akin to a demonic wolf.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.074
Here.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.610
Now, there are many different
varieties and subspecies,

19:05.612 --> 19:07.345
each with their
own characteristics.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.149
Damn it.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.684
Supposed to meet Mitch
for coffee.

19:13.686 --> 19:14.685
I'm just gonna cancel.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.254
No, you should go.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.189
We have so much work to do.
It's fine.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.125
Of which I'm more than capable
of handling alone.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.761
Thank you.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.631
Good.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.966
Where is he?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.468
Or should I say where is it?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.802
I don't know what you mean.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.304
Dreyfuss.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.772
We know he's turned
into something else.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.641
Something that's
murdering people.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.876
That's an interesting theory.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.378
But why should I help you?

19:40.380 --> 19:43.648
Sooner or later, I'm gonna
find the thing that hurts you.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.384
And when I do, I can go easy

19:46.386 --> 19:47.652
or I can go all in.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.453
And trust me,

19:49.455 --> 19:51.222
you don't want me to go all in.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.658
Perhaps you have a point.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.060
Let me see if I can locate him.

19:56.084 --> 19:58.084
Torrent downloaded by RARBG.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.006
My senses are dulled from
all these protective wards.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.909
Perhaps if you
eliminate some of them,

20:11.911 --> 20:13.811
I may have better luck.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.813
Not a chance, demon.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.849
Tell me something,
why do you care

20:18.851 --> 20:20.017
what happens to dreyfuss?

20:20.019 --> 20:22.220
I mean, we all know about
the satanic deal he made,

20:22.222 --> 20:24.355
his soul for his success.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.991
But then he tried to do
an end around.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.927
But I'm not sure how
contract law works in hell,

20:29.929 --> 20:33.397
but my guess is that that
would void his warranty.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.700
Meaning...

20:35.702 --> 20:37.168
You don't owe him anything.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.036
Unless it's...

20:39.038 --> 20:41.272
Some kind of
Stockholm syndrome thing?

20:41.274 --> 20:44.709
You've grown attached
to your abuser?

20:44.711 --> 20:48.779
Or maybe you're just
a two-bit genie

20:48.781 --> 20:51.515
bound to the crackpot who
happened to rub the right lamp.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.284
I will dance to your screams

20:53.286 --> 20:57.722
as you roast in hellfire!

20:57.724 --> 20:59.357
I swear it.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.802
Whole milk latte, extra hot.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.738
Dash of chocolate,
dash of vanilla.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.206
You remembered.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.741
Of course.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.609
I remember everything
when it comes to you.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.913
What's this visit
really about, Mitch?

21:22.915 --> 21:26.217
Okay, guess we're
just diving right in.

21:26.219 --> 21:27.618
No, I'm serious.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.886
You show up with no warning,

21:28.888 --> 21:30.921
and now you just want to be
part of our lives again?

21:30.923 --> 21:33.057
I know it seems sudden, but...

21:33.059 --> 21:34.925
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

21:34.927 --> 21:39.597
I'm getting older,
and I realized

21:39.599 --> 21:41.766
my life doesn't
really add up to much.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.502
And the only thing that counts

21:44.504 --> 21:46.070
is you and Molly.

21:48.507 --> 21:52.443
Well, I-i can't just upend
everything I've built.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.279
And I can't subject her
to any more emotional whiplash.

21:55.281 --> 21:56.781
She's already going
through enough right now.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.883
Really? What's wrong?

21:59.851 --> 22:01.319
Nothing.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.853
Nothing we can't handle.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.155
Look...

22:05.758 --> 22:08.926
I know that I'm...
I'm the last guy in the world

22:08.928 --> 22:10.461
to be giving parental advice,

22:10.463 --> 22:13.297
but if Molly's choices
come down to me

22:13.299 --> 22:15.633
or no father at all?

22:15.635 --> 22:18.135
Maybe it would be good to have

22:18.137 --> 22:21.038
a father figure around for her.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.015
We can do this.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.789
So sorry.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.826
Hello.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.662
That's right.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.731
How long ago?

22:48.300 --> 22:49.500
Okay. Thank you so much.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.605
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

23:03.348 --> 23:04.682
Agent.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.017
I have uncovered
some useful information.

23:08.321 --> 23:09.687
How was the rendezvous?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.922
Complicated.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.024
I have an update, though.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.894
Another body was found,
way outside of our radius,

23:16.896 --> 23:18.496
in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.064
And the coroner estimates

23:20.066 --> 23:21.866
the attack happened
almost a week ago,

23:21.868 --> 23:24.201
way before the
philosopher's stone exploded.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.537
Now, that would call
into question our theory

23:26.539 --> 23:28.839
that dreyfuss is the monster.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.709
You say Plymouth?

23:31.711 --> 23:32.910
Yeah.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.217
Here.

23:40.219 --> 23:43.120
<i>The mayflower chronicles.</i>

23:43.122 --> 23:44.722
It's a private account
of the journey undertaken

23:44.724 --> 23:46.457
by the pilgrims
to the new world.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.527
When the pilgrims
arrived on these shores,

23:49.529 --> 23:51.695
they faced a host of hardships.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.632
Starvation, disease.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.701
<i>And something far deadlier.</i>

24:00.639 --> 24:03.207
<i>The settlers had unwittingly
brought something with them</i>

24:03.209 --> 24:05.042
<i>from the old world.</i>

24:05.044 --> 24:07.978
<i>A monster, stowed away
in the bowels of the mayflower</i>

24:07.980 --> 24:10.614
<i>and come to life upon
their arrival in Plymouth.</i>

24:10.616 --> 24:13.083
Young lady!

24:13.085 --> 24:16.153
There's something
I wish to show you. Come here!

24:26.933 --> 24:29.467
<i>The barghest, a wolf-demon</i>

24:29.469 --> 24:32.570
<i>that originated from
the forests of medieval Europe.</i>

24:36.909 --> 24:39.109
During the middle ages,
the barghest terrorized

24:39.111 --> 24:40.611
the black forest in Germany,

24:40.613 --> 24:43.614
preying on young girls,

24:43.616 --> 24:45.950
and spawned a host of legends,

24:45.952 --> 24:47.751
including the one
that came to be known

24:47.753 --> 24:50.754
as "the tale
of little red riding hood."

24:50.756 --> 24:53.757
As in, "what big teeth
you have, grandma"?

24:53.759 --> 24:55.025
Very same.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.193
Now, many cultures

24:56.195 --> 24:58.095
have different
variations on the tale.

24:58.097 --> 25:02.032
The one you know was popularized
by Jacob and Wilhelm grimm.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.268
Their version was a fairy tale

25:04.270 --> 25:07.905
that highlighted the
creature's deadliest trait.

25:09.474 --> 25:12.309
Its ability to adopt human form.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.311
<i>Not only that,</i>

25:14.313 --> 25:16.313
<i>it would disguise itself
as someone trusted,</i>

25:16.315 --> 25:18.282
<i>someone close to them.</i>

25:20.352 --> 25:23.821
<i>In the case of the pilgrims,</i>

25:23.823 --> 25:25.890
<i>the dead girl
mercy Bradford's father,</i>

25:25.892 --> 25:27.791
<i>captain William Bradford.</i>

25:51.082 --> 25:53.183
Ultimately, they
subdued the creature,

25:53.185 --> 25:55.019
buried it in an
underground chamber,

25:55.021 --> 25:57.655
sealed with an enchanted rock.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.690
Plymouth rock.

25:59.692 --> 26:03.494
You just said that
the creature disguised itself

26:03.496 --> 26:05.496
as someone they all trusted.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.031
Why didn't I see this before?

26:07.033 --> 26:08.699
Mitch said his tour was up,

26:08.701 --> 26:10.834
but he has at least
six months more.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.841
<i>Dispatch.</i>

26:17.843 --> 26:19.209
This is special agent
Diana Thomas.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.011
I need an emergency satcom patch

26:21.013 --> 26:22.880
to fob camp blackhorse
in Afghanistan.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.048
<i>Please hold.</i>

26:24.050 --> 26:25.549
Yes, I'll hold.

26:25.551 --> 26:27.785
<i>Blackhorse.</i>

26:27.787 --> 26:28.953
This is an emergency.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.689
I need to speak
with captain Mitch talbott.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.525
<i>Talbott left five minutes ago
for night patrol.</i>

26:34.527 --> 26:37.161
Five minutes ago...

26:39.030 --> 26:41.231
<i>Can I take a message? Hello?</i>

26:41.233 --> 26:43.434
Molly...

26:55.213 --> 26:57.581
Hey, kiddo.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.483
You want to go for a ride?

27:08.126 --> 27:10.094
I'm Diana Thomas,
I called in the 911.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.262
The place was empty
when we got here.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.598
No signs of struggle
or forced entry.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.501
Neighbors didn't report
anything unusual, either.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.169
You said your ex was here.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.338
Is this a custody issue?

27:28.747 --> 27:30.781
Molly's phone.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.316
She doesn't go anywhere
without this.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.686
He must've taken her fast.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.554
Agent Thomas. My god.

27:38.523 --> 27:41.025
Agent Thomas.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.427
Agent Thomas, hear me.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.462
We will find her.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.797
And what if he's already...

27:46.799 --> 27:48.332
He's not. And he will not.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.602
Not before midnight.

27:51.604 --> 27:53.303
Midnight? Her birthday?

27:53.305 --> 27:55.339
When she turns 11.

27:57.842 --> 28:01.779
Mercy Bradford's father had
described her as "special."

28:01.781 --> 28:03.514
He wrote in his journal that she

28:03.516 --> 28:05.616
was one of "two olive trees
that stand"

28:05.618 --> 28:07.217
before the lord."

28:07.219 --> 28:11.055
This is the biblical description
of the two witnesses.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.690
Mercy Bradford was a witness?

28:12.692 --> 28:14.758
Yes.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.361
<i>According to the chronicles,
she was killed</i>

28:17.363 --> 28:19.163
on her 11th birthday.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.632
Because that is when
the witnesses acquire

28:21.634 --> 28:23.300
their powerful mantle.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.335
And the girls
that he killed before her?

28:25.337 --> 28:27.838
Sustenance.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.173
That rental car plate

28:29.175 --> 28:31.842
you gave us, we got a hit on it.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.477
It's headed north on route 97.

28:41.753 --> 28:43.854
Where are we going?

28:43.856 --> 28:45.255
Told you. Ice cream.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.590
Out here?

28:46.592 --> 28:48.358
Yeah. It's just
a little further.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.161
Mom doesn't like it
when I go out on school nights.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.030
Don't worry,
I'll have you back early.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.966
Besides, you got to live
a little, right?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.071
The hoverboard was great.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.941
Even better than the bike
you got me last Christmas.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.509
Remember?

29:06.511 --> 29:07.911
Bike.

29:09.547 --> 29:10.948
Right.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.187
I need to pee.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.856
We're almost there.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.425
No, I mean I really got
to pee, like, now.

29:41.212 --> 29:42.980
Feldspar bolts.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.249
Made of the same stone
as Plymouth rock.

29:45.251 --> 29:48.252
These should suffice
in vanquishing the beast.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.053
How did this thing
even find Molly?

29:50.055 --> 29:52.489
I may have an answer.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.759
I found this in Molly's room.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.494
Here.

29:57.496 --> 29:58.796
Occult symbols.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.165
Some hermetic, some shamanistic.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.267
What? Why would she draw those?

30:03.269 --> 30:05.269
Research.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.904
All her library books
are concerning magic

30:06.906 --> 30:09.306
and the supernatural.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.242
She bookmarked every page
with reference to the witnesses.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.611
She went looking
for answers on her own.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.246
And in doing so,

30:16.248 --> 30:18.248
she may have fired
a flare into the darkness,

30:18.250 --> 30:19.850
attracting the barghest,

30:19.852 --> 30:21.685
which adopted a form best suited

30:21.687 --> 30:24.454
to gaining yours
and Molly's trust.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.523
A father figure.

30:27.959 --> 30:31.161
Miss Jenny may have
more information on the subject.

30:32.798 --> 30:35.265
Do you have any other way
of tracking the creature?

30:35.267 --> 30:37.267
Not as yet.

30:37.269 --> 30:40.370
The police are aiding us
in locating his vehicle,

30:40.372 --> 30:42.539
but that is all
we have to go on.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.808
And by the time you get there,
it may be long gone.

30:44.810 --> 30:47.211
I can help you find him.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.413
I can locate your quarry.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.717
Crane, let me get back to you.

30:55.887 --> 30:59.323
So, what, you would just help us
out of the goodness of your...

30:59.325 --> 31:02.492
Whatever rotted thing
you have in place of a heart?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.394
I believe we can work out
an arrangement.

31:07.498 --> 31:10.167
You tell me where that creature
is and I'll consider it.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.970
You let me out
and I'll help you find him.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.671
As long as I'm in here,

31:14.673 --> 31:17.407
I can't find him,
even if I wanted to.

31:17.409 --> 31:21.311
And from what I understand,
time is running out.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.990
Molly?

31:35.526 --> 31:38.095
Molly...

32:16.901 --> 32:18.568
In case you try
to screw me over.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.537
A deal is a deal.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.873
It is the oath I live by.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.508
I'm gonna hold you
to that, demon.

32:57.608 --> 33:00.877
Crane, I got it.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.791
They're not in here.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.927
Agent Thomas...

33:24.602 --> 33:26.737
She escaped into the woods.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.347
Molly!

33:40.618 --> 33:42.786
Molly?

33:45.890 --> 33:47.290
Molly!

33:47.292 --> 33:49.292
Where are you, honey?

33:49.294 --> 33:52.062
It can get dangerous out here.

33:58.136 --> 34:00.537
Molly?

34:24.696 --> 34:26.530
Molly?

34:26.532 --> 34:28.364
Molly!

34:28.367 --> 34:30.867
Over here.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.003
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

34:33.005 --> 34:36.273
There's no blood.
There's no blood.

34:36.275 --> 34:39.543
He doesn't have her.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.179
But he's probably close.
Come on.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.809
Stay away from my daughter!

35:36.334 --> 35:37.567
Molly? It's mommy.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.401
It's safe. You can come out.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.669
Mom?

35:43.941 --> 35:45.475
Thank you.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.968
Now, of course,
there art many hypotheses

36:11.970 --> 36:14.538
as to what caused
mad king George's madness.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.106
A common theory is syphilis.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.641
What is syphilis?

36:17.643 --> 36:19.876
Well, syphilis is...

36:21.879 --> 36:22.946
It's syphilis.

36:25.650 --> 36:29.052
Soccer! How fares the team
this season?

36:29.054 --> 36:31.655
Doing well in the tournament

36:31.657 --> 36:34.991
and defeating all comers
with great dispatch, I hope.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.193
Surely we'll come home with
the trophy this season, yes?

36:38.629 --> 36:40.530
You got to come see this.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.966
Crane is successfully
freaking out your friends.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.474
Honey, you don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.742
I can send everyone home.

36:52.744 --> 36:56.112
No, it's okay. I'll be there.

37:07.091 --> 37:09.159
I know it was scary.

37:10.528 --> 37:13.997
I was scared. I was terrified.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.699
It's okay to be upset.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.834
So if that wasn't dad...

37:17.836 --> 37:20.604
And it wasn't.

37:20.606 --> 37:24.207
Then what was it?
Was it a monster?

37:24.209 --> 37:28.945
Yes. It was a monster.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.548
I was responsible
for bringing it here.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.717
By drawing those symbols.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.554
What? No. No.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.889
It was my fault.

37:39.891 --> 37:43.193
I should have just
been honest with you.

37:43.195 --> 37:44.728
I should have just
given you answers,

37:44.730 --> 37:49.699
instead of making you go
looking for them on your own.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.801
I am so sorry.

37:57.141 --> 38:00.443
I thought I could shield you.

38:00.445 --> 38:04.414
The truth is, you're
the witness, not me.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.750
I can't do this for you.

38:06.752 --> 38:09.085
Crane told me that, I just
didn't want to listen.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.921
Best thing I can do is
make sure that you're ready.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.157
So from here on out,

38:14.159 --> 38:16.926
I'm just gonna be honest.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.561
Promise.

38:24.502 --> 38:25.702
Cozy.

38:28.939 --> 38:33.343
"And I will give power
unto my two witnesses.

38:33.345 --> 38:36.646
"These are the two olive trees,

38:36.648 --> 38:38.515
"the two candlesticks that stand

38:38.517 --> 38:41.251
"before the god of the earth.

38:41.253 --> 38:44.421
"And if any man will hurt them,

38:44.423 --> 38:47.524
"fire proceedeth
out of their mouths

38:47.526 --> 38:51.261
and devoureth their enemies."

38:53.632 --> 38:55.865
That's what the Bible
says about us.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.200
What does it mean?

38:57.202 --> 38:58.201
What does it mean?

38:58.203 --> 39:00.036
It means we're in this together.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.372
Two witnesses... we look out
for one another.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.641
Anything we face,
we face as one.

39:04.643 --> 39:09.112
It means, birthday girl...

39:09.114 --> 39:11.014
You're not alone.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.920
Come on, let's go.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.290
Hup! Hup! Hup!

39:21.659 --> 39:23.360
Hi.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.196
Please tell me
I didn't miss the cake.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.565
No, not at all.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.467
The festivities have
only just begun.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.001
So Molly's okay?

39:32.003 --> 39:34.304
A little shaken, understandably,

39:34.306 --> 39:35.839
but she's resilient.

39:35.841 --> 39:37.407
She's a tough little girl.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.908
Yes, she is.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.311
She may need to be
in times to come.

39:41.313 --> 39:43.747
Especially since the party
may soon be over.

39:43.749 --> 39:47.851
Dreyfuss is alive,
and jobe is in the wind.

39:47.853 --> 39:51.521
Is there any indication
what they have planned?

39:51.523 --> 39:54.290
No, but it can't be good.

40:00.765 --> 40:02.532
I know no one wants to confront

40:02.534 --> 40:05.034
the reality of the situation,

40:05.036 --> 40:08.037
but the fact of the matter
is that it falls to us

40:08.039 --> 40:11.074
to act in the best interest
of dreyfuss enterprises.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.743
We've had no contact
with Malcolm for days,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.212
and serious decisions
need to be made, so...

40:16.214 --> 40:19.949
Yes, they do.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.552
And here's my first decision.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.854
I've come to believe

40:24.856 --> 40:26.389
I don't need any of you anymore.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.725
Malcolm. My god.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.527
Are you all right?

40:30.529 --> 40:33.963
Helen, the thing is,
is I've never been better.

40:35.232 --> 40:37.567
And I realize that I...

40:37.569 --> 40:39.536
I probably look a little
worse for wear,

40:39.538 --> 40:41.137
but that's only because

40:41.139 --> 40:43.473
I've been reborn.

40:43.475 --> 40:46.376
Birth is a violent process.

40:46.378 --> 40:49.145
The creation of the new
can only come after

40:49.147 --> 40:51.648
the destruction of the old.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.917
What I'm saying is I...

40:53.919 --> 40:56.753
I have successfully destroyed

40:56.755 --> 40:59.489
what I used to be
in order to become

40:59.491 --> 41:00.890
who I need to be.

41:04.595 --> 41:07.263
Malcolm, we'll get help.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.899
Well, thank you, Helen.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.134
Thank you.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.938
But I don't need your help.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.775
What I really need most of all

41:18.777 --> 41:21.544
is for each and
every one of you...

41:22.746 --> 41:24.347
to get out.

41:26.617 --> 41:28.518
Get out!

41:31.690 --> 41:33.556
Is that a little clearer?

41:44.803 --> 41:47.003
Oops.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.643
I've already fired you.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.311
If you insist on lurking,

41:55.313 --> 41:57.647
I will have you
drawn and quartered.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.716
Done that.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.484
It was unpleasant.

42:01.486 --> 42:05.221
Jobe.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.590
Damn it all, jobe.

42:09.326 --> 42:10.994
I...

42:10.996 --> 42:13.496
I have missed you so much.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.832
Where have you been?

42:15.834 --> 42:19.168
I might ask the same
question of you.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.237
I've been on a journey,
my friend.

42:21.239 --> 42:25.174
A long, long,
long journey of the soul.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.743
The kind of journey
that I intend

42:26.745 --> 42:28.411
to take the world on as well.

42:28.413 --> 42:31.347
The world? Yes.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.515
I've been changed, jobe.

42:32.517 --> 42:35.418
This change has helped me see

42:35.420 --> 42:38.688
that I... I have a powerful need

42:38.690 --> 42:40.390
to make sure the entire world

42:40.392 --> 42:41.824
changes for the better, as well.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.002
I swear to you,

42:53.004 --> 42:56.406
I will not rest until
this world is born again.
