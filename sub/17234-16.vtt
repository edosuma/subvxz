WHAT YOU SAID

39:45.583 --> 39:47.352
ABOUT JEFF
NOT RESPECTING ME,

39:47.352 --> 39:51.389
AND I REALIZED
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER RESPECT ME

39:51.389 --> 39:54.092
IF I WENT BACK
TO EDGEHILL.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.593
SO I TORE THE CONTRACT UP.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.328

MM-HMM.

39:57.328 --> 40:00.531
JEFF'S OPINION OF ME
IS NEVER REALLY GONNA CHANGE.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.434
AND YOURS MATTERS
A WHOLE LOT MORE.

40:03.434 --> 40:06.237
SO, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

40:06.237 --> 40:08.473
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER OFFERS?

40:08.473 --> 40:10.975
I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

40:10.975 --> 40:15.380
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
<i>YOU</i> ARE MY BEST OFFER.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.448
CAN WE TRY DINNER AGAIN?

40:17.448 --> 40:19.117

WHEN WE SPOKE.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.554
MY HEAD WAS IN MY WORK.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.022

NOW IT'S IN MY HAT.

40:58.022 --> 40:59.357
[ CHUCKLES ]

40:59.357 --> 41:01.125
