00:08.660 --> 00:09.748
I found a couple of places that
I think are pretty cute.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.881
I need to see my dad.

00:13.883 --> 00:17.408
Russell and I had a fight,
and he's totally cheating on me.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.062
This one is for Hank.

00:19.193 --> 00:22.848
After taking away
your classes, no.

00:22.979 --> 00:24.415
You mean to work it out
with Russell,

00:24.546 --> 00:27.505
and then in like 25 years,
leave him in a cloud of denial?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.941
Oh.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.727
You're talking about Hank.

00:31.857 --> 00:34.686
He won't actually
speak to me now.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.079
Did you know that?

00:39.561 --> 00:40.866
So it's the middle
of the night,

00:40.997 --> 00:42.738
and, uh, I'm naked,

00:42.868 --> 00:44.435
I'm in a museum,

00:44.566 --> 00:46.655
I'm surrounded by
these Roman statues, right,

00:46.785 --> 00:48.918
and I realize
I have to take a leak,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.137
so I go to the bathroom,

00:50.267 --> 00:53.705
and Rodin's Thinking Guy, right,

00:53.836 --> 00:56.230
he's either there already,
or he followed me in.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.883
-Uh-huh.
-I'm trying to take a leak,

00:58.014 --> 01:00.016
but he's staring at me,

01:00.147 --> 01:03.106
and then, suddenly,
the statue starts to pee.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.325
I mean, like,

01:04.455 --> 01:06.501
the longest, loudest pee
that you've ever heard,

01:06.631 --> 01:07.893
like Vesuvius.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.070
-[laughs]
-Like Niagara.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.680
I mean, he's mocking me.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.204
I get no relief,
not even in my sleep.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.555
I'm kind of clogged up.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.732
[blows hard through nose]

01:20.863 --> 01:22.343
[blowing]

01:22.473 --> 01:24.475
Wow. Wow, loud.

01:24.606 --> 01:25.781
That was much louder

01:25.911 --> 01:27.565
than I thought
it was going to be.

01:27.696 --> 01:30.351
It was exactly as loud
as I thought it would be.

01:30.481 --> 01:34.094
Did you look at
the apartments I sent you?

01:34.223 --> 01:36.922
Yeah, whatever you want's fine.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.533
But I want you to feel like
it's your place, too.

01:39.882 --> 01:41.926
You don't have any preferences?

01:42.058 --> 01:43.146
I...

01:43.277 --> 01:44.104
I don't know,

01:44.234 --> 01:45.844
a place with some nature
around it,

01:45.975 --> 01:47.585
and a view of the river?

01:47.716 --> 01:48.586
You know anything like that?

01:48.717 --> 01:49.544
I'm off.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.590
[gasps] Did you just
give me the cheek?

01:53.983 --> 01:55.332
I haven't brushed.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.595
Uh-uh, not today.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.163
Okay.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.687
I will call you from New York.

02:02.818 --> 02:03.688
I love you.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.342
You too.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.346
No jail this time.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.044
Ha!

02:13.045 --> 02:15.135
You're way too happy!

[Hank, thinking]
Oh, good.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.248
Two jars of pickles.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.512
Which are the good ones?

03:28.643 --> 03:30.471
Hmm, what if I choose
the wrong one?

03:30.601 --> 03:33.517
Oh, forget it.

03:33.648 --> 03:37.260
[♪♪]

03:51.013 --> 03:52.928
Uh, yeah.
The green pickles.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.234
Green for good.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.845
Wait. No.
Blue for better?

03:56.975 --> 03:57.672
Was that...

04:03.025 --> 04:07.159
[♪♪]

04:19.998 --> 04:21.043

[woman on TV]
Oh, I'm so glad!

04:35.492 --> 04:37.538
[man] Yeah, yeah.
I have to end it on--

04:37.668 --> 04:39.453
[woman] --on a high note.

04:39.582 --> 04:40.671
[man] Yeah, girl,
yes, absolutely.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.979
[woman]
Oh, I'm so happy about that.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.981
-Hi, Julie.
-Hi.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.157
I've called you,
like, five times.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.551
I know.
I can't find my phone.

04:51.943 --> 04:53.728
This phone?

04:53.858 --> 04:54.772
Oh, there it is.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.774
-Thanks.
-Yup.

04:56.905 --> 04:58.123
Hey.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.777
Has Russell been here at all?

04:59.908 --> 05:00.909
I don't know, was he here?

05:01.039 --> 05:02.040
Dad!

05:02.171 --> 05:03.607
[snapping fingers] Focus.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.914
Have you seen Russell
in the past 24 hours?

05:06.044 --> 05:07.872
[sighs heavily]

05:08.003 --> 05:09.221
No.

05:09.352 --> 05:10.135
-Okay.
-Something wrong?

05:10.266 --> 05:11.311
No.

05:11.441 --> 05:12.312
It's nothing.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.792
When does Mom get back?

05:14.923 --> 05:17.012
In a couple days, I think.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.625
Um...

05:21.756 --> 05:24.019
Russell didn't come home
last night.

05:26.064 --> 05:27.327
Is that unusual?

05:27.457 --> 05:28.719
Yes.

05:28.850 --> 05:29.720
We're married.

05:29.851 --> 05:30.591
You were at the wedding.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.332
You were so pretty.

05:36.727 --> 05:37.815
Well, did you call him?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.384
You didn't think
I'd try calling him?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.908
Well, do you want me
to call him?

05:44.039 --> 05:45.475
Yeah, I guess.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.650
I'd like to know he's okay,
and not, like,

05:46.781 --> 05:48.783
at the bottom
of a lake somewhere.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.612
Are you guys fighting?

05:51.742 --> 05:53.962
We're kind of always fighting,
but it's fine.

05:54.092 --> 05:56.225
Oh.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.270
I can't...
I thought I had his contact.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.315
Do you have his number?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.795
Oh, my God.

06:00.925 --> 06:01.839
Okay.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.101
Forget it.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.190
Thank you so much.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.191
Goodbye.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.323

If you're here
to slaughter my father,

06:18.334 --> 06:18.987

Yeah, I get that about you.

Yeah...

06:29.998 --> 06:32.043
Ew.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.219
I brought your stinkin'
chainsaw back.

06:34.350 --> 06:36.004
Just put it on the bed.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.092
So you can spoon it?

06:40.225 --> 06:42.271
Are you depressed because
you miss our friendship?

I'm sorry.

Nice apology.

You can keep the chainsaw.

-I don't want it.
-It's an expensive one.

Take a look at these.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.843
I see.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.105
I see 'em.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.716
It's a white Trillium,
or Trinity Flower.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.935
See it's got three petals,
one, two, three?

07:38.066 --> 07:39.415
Okay.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.721
They're really rare to find.

07:40.851 --> 07:41.983
Come on.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.463
Take a look.

07:45.334 --> 07:48.119
The Native Americans use them
for medicinal purposes.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.904
That's fine.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.080
Actually,
they're considered endangered

07:52.210 --> 07:54.952
because they take
up to ten years to grow.

07:55.082 --> 07:55.692
[grunts]

07:57.128 --> 07:57.999
Beautiful.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.261

they were endangered.

Yeah, put it back
'cause that's how flowers work.

You know how
when Zelda and I got divorced,

08:15.451 --> 08:17.366
we each took a night table?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.977
I wasn't tracking that,
but sure.

08:20.108 --> 08:22.457
So now she's remarried
and wants the other night table,

08:22.589 --> 08:23.981
and I know it's putting
a lot on a piece of furniture,

08:24.112 --> 08:26.027
but I kind of felt like
we were still connected,

08:26.157 --> 08:28.638
like I wasn't sleeping alone.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.423
I gave Lily the cheek
the other day

08:31.554 --> 08:33.034
when she leaned in
to kiss goodbye.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.861
So we're talking
about you now?

08:34.991 --> 08:36.341

That's why I showed up.

08:36.472 --> 08:37.559
Okay, I had my time.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.996
So are you mad at her
for leaving?

08:40.128 --> 08:41.825
I didn't think I was
till I gave her the cheek,

08:41.956 --> 08:44.698
but I thought
I was happy for her.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.787
Well, the lips know more
than the brain.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.397
Yeah.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.312
My anger has nowhere to go.

08:50.442 --> 08:52.444
It's unhoused.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.359
I'm like
the Count of Monte Cristo,

08:54.490 --> 08:56.753
but instead of plotting revenge
for 40 years,

08:56.884 --> 08:58.538
I've been plotting
a pointed conversation

08:58.668 --> 09:01.018
with my dad,

09:01.149 --> 09:03.891
and now the man that
I wanted to confront is gone.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.457
Gone.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.808
It's like an action movie,

09:07.938 --> 09:09.505
where I go to punch a guy,

09:09.636 --> 09:11.855
and he ducks,
and I hit the guy behind him,

09:11.986 --> 09:14.075
and then I'm feeling guilty,

09:14.205 --> 09:15.163
then the guy behind me

09:15.293 --> 09:16.947
whacks me
in the back of the head.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.470
Look, I've been here.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.168
No one knows
an existential hole

like a divorced person.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.737
Climbing out isn't easy.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.608
Start with one thing.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.566
Something simple.

09:26.696 --> 09:27.871
Could be as easy

09:28.002 --> 09:29.090
as just picking clothes up
off the floor.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.961
Get it done.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.789
Notice the feeling.

09:32.920 --> 09:33.964
Tomorrow,
you'll get two things.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.009
Come on. [claps]
Be present.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.314
Close your eyes.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.621
First thing that comes up
off the top of your head.

09:38.752 --> 09:39.796
Close your eyes.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.322
Um....
Uh, my sink is leaking.

09:44.453 --> 09:46.890
The hose is broken.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.849
Well, you've got to get
right on that.

09:48.979 --> 09:49.850
I will.

09:49.980 --> 09:50.677
It'll get
under your floorboards,

09:50.807 --> 09:51.678
it could cost you 15 grand.

09:51.808 --> 09:52.679
I will.

09:52.809 --> 09:53.549
You'll get black mold
under there.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.811
What are you even doing here?

09:54.942 --> 09:55.682
I'll go.

in the woods,

a Vichyssoise for lunch.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.029
I need a toothbrush, Laurel.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.335
Oh, well, give me 15 minutes.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.641
I'll drive you into town.

10:41.771 --> 10:42.946
I want to drive myself.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.167
Oh, don't start
that again, Henry.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.473
You lived in Manhattan
far too long

10:48.604 --> 10:50.345
to remember how to drive.

10:50.475 --> 10:51.389
We drove upstate last winter.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.783
I love to drive.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.872
We'll go together.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.395
We'll make it an outing.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.529
I don't want a goddamn outing.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.445
I want to drive myself
into town

11:03.575 --> 11:04.925
and get it,

11:05.055 --> 11:06.143
alone.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.843
Well, I won't let you.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.584
I'm sorry, Henry,
it's far too risky.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.340
[cell phone vibrating]

11:33.562 --> 11:34.824
Hey.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.608
[Lily] Hey,
I was thinking about you.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.088
I'm where we had
our second date.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.960
Do you remember
that little cafe on West 4th?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.962
And my realtor,

11:42.092 --> 11:43.311
I swear to you,

11:43.441 --> 11:45.008
he looks just like the guy
from The Bachelor.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.271
You had a crush on him, right?

11:47.402 --> 11:48.882
[Lily] No.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.971
I just thought
he was too good for that girl.

11:51.101 --> 11:55.018
Well, look,
Russell's been gone overnight.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.412
He's probably
in some motel somewhere,

11:57.542 --> 12:00.154
blowing all his money
on whores and drugs

12:00.284 --> 12:01.721
and whatever's
in the mini fridge.

12:01.851 --> 12:02.983
Oh, yeah, she told you?

12:03.113 --> 12:04.027
Yeah, we spoke.

12:04.158 --> 12:04.811
Julie and I,

12:04.941 --> 12:06.464
not Russell.

12:06.595 --> 12:08.336
So what should I do?

12:08.466 --> 12:10.033
It's their marriage.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.644
Just keep your brain
out of their headspace.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.342
It's full of booby-traps.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.258
Julie just needs
to take this time

12:17.388 --> 12:19.303
and figure it out on her own.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.001
Sorry.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.089
[Hank] You've got to be
kidding me.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.525
[Lily] Do you have
a different take?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.353
No, I'm passing my dad.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.050
He's walking.
I heard what you said.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.052
I'll stay out of it.
That's my forte.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.054
Oh, Christ, if I pick him up...

12:31.185 --> 12:33.665
I've got to go to work
and the hardware store.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.234
Hello?

12:37.365 --> 12:38.279
He hung up on me.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.628
Ah.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.238
Lily-Lil!

12:41.369 --> 12:43.458
Today's the day
we find you a new home.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.764
The vibes are strong today.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.464
Hey, partner!

12:49.594 --> 12:50.595
Rodeo is back that way.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.336
You need a ride?

12:52.467 --> 12:53.860
Uh, no thanks.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.600
Dad! Dad, it's me!

12:55.731 --> 12:56.819
Come on.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.125
Come on, get in.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.826
[Hank, thinking]
He's losing his marbles.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.785
Well, I always hated
his marbles,

13:05.915 --> 13:07.743
so maybe
there's something better

13:07.874 --> 13:10.006
rattling around in there now.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.181
A couple of nickels?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.836
Maybe a rare one I could sell?

13:13.967 --> 13:15.446
You can't take me home.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.579
Well, I gotta go to work, so...

13:17.709 --> 13:18.406
I'll go with you.

13:18.536 --> 13:19.799
No, I...

13:22.018 --> 13:23.672
Does Laurel know where you are?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.761
I gotta get my own car.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.632
She keeps me trapped at home

13:27.763 --> 13:29.504
like I'm
in a Stephen King novel.

13:29.634 --> 13:30.505
Could be worse.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.594
It could be
a Jane Austen novel.

13:32.724 --> 13:33.595
Yuck.

13:33.725 --> 13:34.857
All right, buckle up.

13:34.988 --> 13:36.293
[Paul, shouting]
Dammit, Leslie!

13:36.424 --> 13:38.339
That is a bald-faced lie!

13:38.469 --> 13:40.036
[Leslie, on speakerphone]
I'm just the messenger here.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.951
We would...

13:42.082 --> 13:43.692
[clicking off speakerphone]
We would support a strike.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.040
You know we would.

13:45.172 --> 13:46.913
It's the damn French department

13:47.043 --> 13:49.959
and their stupid French berets!

13:52.135 --> 13:53.093
[slams door]

13:53.223 --> 13:54.877
We are and have,

13:55.008 --> 13:56.313
until recently, always...

13:56.444 --> 13:57.053
[Hank] Right through here.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.840
What's going on over there?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.363
Rourke's on
with the union rep.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.539
Something about
the legislature vote coming up.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.975
What did she say?
What did you say?

14:06.106 --> 14:07.759
It's nothing.
It's budget cuts.

14:07.890 --> 14:08.673
What cuts?
What are they cutting?

14:08.804 --> 14:10.110
Uh, right through here.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.546
That wasn't an issue
at Columbia.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.723
Yeah, the Columbia endowment
was $21 billion.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.811
If I needed something,

14:15.942 --> 14:17.465
we'd just call
the president's girl,

14:17.595 --> 14:18.596
and that was it.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.989
You'd call his daughter?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.904
Uh, look,
this is my father, Henry.

14:22.035 --> 14:23.732
This is my assistant, Rachel.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.081
She's going
to take care of you.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.387
Listen, if he gets feisty,

14:26.517 --> 14:28.345
just, uh...

14:28.476 --> 14:31.348
just give him some of
these student papers to read.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.350
She looks gifted.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.352
And so it begins.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.354
Young lady, I'd like your help
with a couple of things.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.921
All right, cool it.

14:39.052 --> 14:39.835
It's okay.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.271
What do you need,
Mr. Devereaux?

14:41.402 --> 14:42.620
First, I'd like a coffee,

14:42.751 --> 14:44.187
light, with two sugars.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.276
Second, I'd like to know

14:46.407 --> 14:48.583
what's on your bedside table.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.193
[Hank] You don't have to answer.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.803
[laughs awkwardly] Excuse me?

14:51.934 --> 14:53.631
What are you reading now?

14:53.762 --> 14:55.503
Oh.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.591
Okay, he can read them,

14:56.721 --> 14:58.027
but don't let him
grade anything.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.772
Our faithful union rep

15:03.903 --> 15:05.513
won't call for a strike.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.862
Why not?

15:06.993 --> 15:07.950
She's prudent.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.430
She's a pussy.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.085
[Paul] Well,
she thinks it will fail

15:12.215 --> 15:16.524
because department chairs
like Hank here

15:16.654 --> 15:18.134
abandoned the union weeks ago.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.615
[exhales]

15:20.745 --> 15:23.009
Remember how
our last strike went?

15:23.139 --> 15:25.533
We lost more ground
than we gained.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.144
[Paul] So then this time,
we do it better.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.192
That's all you ever do,
is nothing!

15:34.020 --> 15:34.759
Your solution
to everything, right?

15:34.890 --> 15:36.805
Don't even try?

15:38.894 --> 15:42.550
You've screwed us all.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.161
Them's the facts.

15:48.730 --> 15:49.949
[slams door]

15:54.910 --> 15:57.695
My car lease is up tomorrow.

15:57.826 --> 15:58.914
Ah, you know what?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.569
I'm just going to assume
the worst and get a Kia.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.484
Where have we landed?

16:03.614 --> 16:05.790
[Teddy] Well, Dickie Pope's
a master tactician.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.706
Our plan can't be
to outsmart him.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.447
Why don't you keep
sucking his balls,

16:10.578 --> 16:11.231
and we seeing
where that gets us?

16:12.797 --> 16:14.669
[Teddy] Look,
I'm just pointing out

16:14.799 --> 16:17.889
that he's executing
his plan brilliantly.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.631
You know,
he hasn't missed a step.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.068
So, realistically,
we're going to lose this.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.374
Aren't we?

16:24.505 --> 16:26.072
Hank?

16:27.595 --> 16:30.076
So, can you at least
tell us what you're thinking?

16:30.206 --> 16:32.208
You're not going to like it.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.124
We're grownups.

16:40.521 --> 16:44.220
I've really got to replace
the hose on my kitchen sink.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.700
[cell phone vibrating]

16:45.830 --> 16:47.049
[Emma] Jesus.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.183
[sighs]

16:50.313 --> 16:52.141
Hey, Julie,
I'm on my way to class.

16:52.272 --> 16:53.186
I just have a minute.
What's up?

16:53.316 --> 16:54.448
I just went to Russell's
pottery class,

16:54.578 --> 16:55.623
which he never misses,

16:55.753 --> 16:56.537
and he wasn't there,

16:56.667 --> 16:57.538
and his teacher said

16:57.668 --> 16:58.713
it was a weird day
for him to miss

16:58.843 --> 17:00.280
because he was about to do
under-glazing,

17:00.410 --> 17:01.716
and he hasn't returned
any of my texts,

17:01.846 --> 17:02.978
and none of his friends
have heard from him,

17:03.109 --> 17:04.719
and I think something's
wrong with him, Dad.

17:04.848 --> 17:05.849
Like, this isn't like him.

17:05.981 --> 17:07.939
Right.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.419
Okay, well, something's
definitely happened to him.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.421
What, do I call the police?

17:11.551 --> 17:13.336
The FBI doesn't get involved
unless it's been three days,

17:13.467 --> 17:14.816
I know that from Euphoria.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.425
[Hank] Look,

17:16.557 --> 17:19.212
what is the most logical
explanation here, okay?

17:19.342 --> 17:21.736
You told Mom you thought
he was having an affair?

17:21.866 --> 17:23.520
Yeah, but that was wrong.

17:23.651 --> 17:24.739
Even Mom said so.

17:24.868 --> 17:26.262
That was about us
not connecting

17:26.393 --> 17:27.959
because I never see him.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.396
[Hank] Well, why is that?

17:29.526 --> 17:31.137
Because of that stupid job
you made him take.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.052
Can you just
tell me what to do?

17:33.182 --> 17:35.010
[clearing throat]

17:35.141 --> 17:38.231
All right, I'm talking about
the simplest reason, okay?

17:38.361 --> 17:39.493
Have you ever heard of
Occam's Razor?

17:39.623 --> 17:41.103
Okay?

17:41.234 --> 17:43.323
It means
the most obvious explanation

17:43.453 --> 17:44.672
is very often the truth.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.978
That sounds dumb.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.069
It just means that
Russell isn't calling you back,

17:50.199 --> 17:51.157
and he's not coming home

17:51.287 --> 17:53.072
because he doesn't want to.

17:54.334 --> 17:55.857
Now I know
why Mom's leaving you.

17:55.987 --> 17:56.771
I...

18:00.688 --> 18:02.907
"...and he sat back
in the doctor's armchair,

18:03.038 --> 18:05.910
and the room got smaller,

18:06.041 --> 18:08.130
and the air got colder,

18:08.261 --> 18:09.914
and the chair got
less comfortable,

18:10.045 --> 18:11.133
and the carpet--"

18:11.264 --> 18:13.179
Okay, Lester, that's...

18:13.309 --> 18:14.528
that's interesting,

18:14.658 --> 18:16.834
interesting take on...

18:16.965 --> 18:19.968
the subject of having
an hour left to live,

18:20.099 --> 18:23.145
but I think we left Jen's story
a little early.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.540
Jen, you said
your protagonist was 24?

18:26.670 --> 18:27.932
22, actually.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.717
Okay, whatever.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.980
She needs help,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.547
but she never
asks her father for help.

18:33.677 --> 18:34.678
Why is that?

18:37.333 --> 18:40.162
Well, her father's
not in the story.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.556
The story's about
how she lost her neighbor's dog.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.473
Yes, yes,
but as a curious reader,

18:46.603 --> 18:48.562
I'm just wondering
if the father gave her,

18:48.692 --> 18:52.305
you know, probably true advice
on how to find a dog,

18:52.435 --> 18:53.654
or manage one,

18:53.784 --> 18:56.265
what...
what would that look like?

18:56.396 --> 18:58.746
Why would she call
her dad, though?

18:58.876 --> 19:00.051
I mean, I don't think the reader

19:00.182 --> 19:01.009
is going to be
thinking about that.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.619
The perceptive reader would.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.794
No.

19:03.925 --> 19:06.014
No call, 'cause...

19:06.145 --> 19:07.233
here's what's going to happen.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.886
She's going to
give her dad a call,

19:09.017 --> 19:11.324
and he's going to give
some messed-up fatherly advice,

19:11.454 --> 19:13.152
and probably get too involved

19:13.282 --> 19:15.023
and take away her agency.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.068
No way she's calling her dad.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.766
You called your father.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.855
What?

19:22.335 --> 19:24.989
Are we talking about my story?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.817
So, what about my story?

19:26.948 --> 19:28.602
No, we're still talking
about Jen's story,

19:28.732 --> 19:30.125
just Jen's story,

19:30.256 --> 19:31.039
but let's--

19:31.170 --> 19:32.432
Take away her agency,

19:32.562 --> 19:35.043
let me push back on that.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.392
[sighs]

19:36.523 --> 19:38.699
She's an adult,
so how does he do that?

19:38.829 --> 19:39.787
He can't.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.832
Also, if he doesn't help her,

19:41.963 --> 19:43.486
isn't he abandoning her?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.488
[Bartow] No, it still
takes away from her story.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.229
Well, it shows that he cares.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.492
He could just care in his head

19:49.623 --> 19:50.885
because I didn't write him
into the story.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.496
[Bartow] If I may, Professor,

19:53.627 --> 19:54.715
I think what you're trying
to say is that...

19:54.845 --> 19:57.326
Well, and this is also true
in my experience,

19:57.457 --> 20:00.373
every character carries
three characters with them--

20:00.503 --> 20:02.026
a father, a mother,

20:02.157 --> 20:03.027
a younger sister.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.942
Yeah!
That's right.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.118
But is this kind of
character work

20:07.249 --> 20:08.859
on people who aren't actually
in the story really important?

20:08.990 --> 20:09.904
[Bartow and Hank together]
It's vital.

20:10.034 --> 20:10.774
[Hank] Yeah, uh...

20:11.732 --> 20:13.081
[stammers]

20:13.212 --> 20:15.910
Yes, I mean,
the father is in her life.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.172
He should be in her story.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.348
Yeah, he should help her
find the dog.

20:20.567 --> 20:21.655
[exhaling] Okay.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.614
Then, um...

20:24.745 --> 20:26.616
her father died
when she was three.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.009
-Aw, that's...
-Okay, yeah,

20:28.139 --> 20:29.053
no, that's just lazy.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.054
Yeah.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.839
[cell phone buzzing]

20:31.969 --> 20:33.319
What?

20:33.449 --> 20:34.668
Have you seen Russell?

20:34.798 --> 20:35.625
[Meg] Nope.

20:35.756 --> 20:36.496
Has he been at work?

20:36.626 --> 20:37.932
[Meg] Nope.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.717
Okay, well, if you see him,
have him call me, okay?

20:40.848 --> 20:41.805
Julie is worried about him.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.111
[Meg] Yup.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.461
Is everything okay?

20:47.855 --> 20:50.510
You can't hide forever.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.076
[exhales]

20:52.207 --> 20:54.557
I know.

20:54.688 --> 20:55.863
To wit,

20:55.993 --> 20:58.431
I have never been
more stuck in the muck

20:58.561 --> 21:01.695
than on that blistery
New York evening,

21:01.825 --> 21:03.262
and, of course,

21:03.392 --> 21:06.743
my mind went directly
to Dickens

21:06.874 --> 21:10.486
and his irrational fear
of hansom cabs.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.098
Um, where was I?

21:14.229 --> 21:15.926
Uh, fear of cabs.

21:16.057 --> 21:16.927
[Henry] Yes.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.539
We know Dickens suffered trauma

21:19.669 --> 21:22.150
from a train derailment
he was in.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.980
He wrote a letter in 1865

21:26.110 --> 21:29.723
to an opera singer
he met in Paris,

21:29.853 --> 21:32.552
Madame Pauline Viardot.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.510
Fascinating...

21:34.641 --> 21:35.468
[quietly] You let him out?

21:35.598 --> 21:36.469
Well, I couldn't just
lock him in--

21:36.599 --> 21:37.470
What did you do to him?

21:37.600 --> 21:39.210
He hates Dickens, okay?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.038
He's written three books
on how much he hates Dickens.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.563
Well, I didn't know.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.478
[Hank, thinking]
What is it about fame

21:45.608 --> 21:47.915
that turns people
into sycophantic morons?

21:48.045 --> 21:50.047
I mean, he can barely tie
his own shoelaces,

21:50.178 --> 21:52.485
and he's spitting out nonsense
from muscle memory here,

21:52.615 --> 21:54.356
and they're riveted,

21:54.487 --> 21:56.140
like he's Taylor Swift,

21:56.271 --> 21:58.969
and they're, you know,
the world.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.797
Scintillating anecdote.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.626
I wonder if you might perhaps
drop by my class.

22:03.757 --> 22:04.497
[Hank] Oh, no, no.

22:04.627 --> 22:05.802
No. We've got to leave.

22:05.933 --> 22:06.847
What?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.327
-He didn't finish his story.
-Yeah.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.067
Yes, he did.

22:10.198 --> 22:12.156
A few more minutes.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.157
Okay.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.376
I'll see you in 10 years.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.334
[chuckles]

22:15.464 --> 22:17.292
Hey...

22:17.423 --> 22:19.076
Your daughter hung up on me.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.077
Good for her.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.427
If you're not careful,

22:21.557 --> 22:22.253
she's going to turn out
like you.

22:23.864 --> 22:24.821
Maybe she's still mad at you.

22:24.952 --> 22:26.823
Mad at me? Why?

22:26.954 --> 22:29.348
Why?
Because you fired her.

22:29.478 --> 22:30.349
You lied to her.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.306
You told her
that you didn't have

22:31.437 --> 22:33.264
any more classes to offer her.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.092
But she doesn't know I lied.

22:35.223 --> 22:37.138
You told her?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.011
Well, she was going to take
a gig in Tennessee.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.273
You know?

22:42.404 --> 22:43.013
So, what am I going to do,

22:43.144 --> 22:44.754
see her once a year?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.190
She's the only daughter I like.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.018
What are my Thanksgivings
gonna be without Margaret?

22:48.149 --> 22:49.629
Sitting in some damn diner

22:49.759 --> 22:51.239
listening
to my stupid son-in-law

22:51.370 --> 22:53.589
talk about monster truck shows?

22:55.243 --> 22:56.026
You handled this perfectly.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.376
Nice job.

22:57.506 --> 22:58.333
Okay, the lecture's over.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.769
Seriously.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.118
Come on.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.293
You've got to get your coat.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.691
If anyone calls,
I've gone fishing.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.040
-Okay.
-[telephone rings]

23:10.171 --> 23:11.128
I got it.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.043
English department.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.351
Uh, okay.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.831
Hey, Gracie?

23:21.225 --> 23:22.618
Dean Rose
would like to see you.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.796
He wants to see me?

23:26.927 --> 23:29.277
Can't I just--
Can I call him?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.541
He said
it's a sensitive matter?

23:35.283 --> 23:37.111
Is-Is someone
from Human Resources

23:37.241 --> 23:38.112
going to be there?

23:38.242 --> 23:40.680
He didn't say?

23:42.159 --> 23:43.639
Well, this can't be.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.859
I mean, you...
you don't think...

23:45.989 --> 23:48.035
You don't think that this is...

23:48.165 --> 23:49.993
I was just published!

24:01.788 --> 24:02.484
[Rourke whistles]

24:07.750 --> 24:09.186
I'm sorry--

24:09.317 --> 24:10.057
It's all right, Jill,
I sent for her.

24:10.187 --> 24:10.710
Gracie, sit--

24:10.840 --> 24:11.537
I will not sit,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.277
and I will not go,

24:13.408 --> 24:14.714
gently or otherwise...

24:14.844 --> 24:15.758
-Gracie--
-...and if I do,

24:15.889 --> 24:17.891
you can count on it
being otherwise.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.414
-Gracie--
-My class enrollments

24:19.545 --> 24:20.371
are the highest
in the department.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.634
All of my courses
have waitlists.

24:21.764 --> 24:24.114
Sometimes, students wait
two or three hours

24:24.245 --> 24:25.594
to see if they're
granted access!

24:25.725 --> 24:27.509
How can you put me
on the chopping block?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.555
Oh, this isn't about that.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.557
This...

24:31.687 --> 24:33.689
I did it.

24:33.820 --> 24:34.734
I'm getting a divorce.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.997
It's finally happening.

24:37.127 --> 24:37.911
You moved out?

24:38.041 --> 24:39.565
Well...

24:39.695 --> 24:41.175
-Oh, my God.
-No, this is real.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.176
I said the words.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.873
She took it well.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.005
Too well, to be honest,

24:45.135 --> 24:46.789
and she actually thanked me

24:46.920 --> 24:47.877
because I brought it up first,

24:48.008 --> 24:50.619
and then she went out
with friends.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.316
You're too late.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.057
Maybe,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.930
maybe if you had come to me
six months ago, but...

24:57.060 --> 24:59.193
I am on the rise.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.587
You had your chance.

25:04.154 --> 25:07.636
We dipped our palms
in chalk to...

25:08.811 --> 25:11.771
...keep our hands
from letting go...

25:11.901 --> 25:13.729
and...

25:16.906 --> 25:19.518
Interesting interpretation.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.435
It's 380 square feet,

25:24.566 --> 25:25.959
massive walk-in closet.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.221
Mm-hmm.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.789
Hardwood floors,

25:29.919 --> 25:32.008
and a cute little alcove.

25:32.139 --> 25:32.966
Oh, yeah.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.445
That's nice.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.970
And you're only two blocks away
from the A and C subway lines,

25:37.100 --> 25:39.625
which takes you
right into Penn Station.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.104
That's where
your school is, yeah?

25:41.235 --> 25:43.411
Yeah.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.587
And this one's 2,900?

25:45.718 --> 25:46.806
2,885.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.024
Oh.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.028
Hmm?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.989
I don't know.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.034
It's very cute.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.689
It's a little small.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.126
I'm just thinking
if my husband comes to visit,

26:03.257 --> 26:04.519
or my daughter,

26:04.650 --> 26:05.651
or what if both of them come
at the same time,

26:05.781 --> 26:06.956
then what do we do?

26:07.087 --> 26:08.523
[chuckles]

26:08.654 --> 26:10.046
Okay, I'm noticing
a pattern here.

26:10.177 --> 26:11.744
Do you see the pattern?

26:11.874 --> 26:13.354
Look, I show you a small place,

26:13.484 --> 26:15.443
you talk about visitors.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.662
I show you a big place--

26:16.792 --> 26:19.012
Oh, yeah, I see.
[chuckling]

26:19.142 --> 26:19.882
Okay,

26:20.013 --> 26:21.754
here's what we're gonna do.

26:21.884 --> 26:24.191
I only do this
for my favorite clients.

26:24.321 --> 26:25.192
Close your eyes.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.063
Okay.

26:27.194 --> 26:32.068
Now imagine your perfect day.

26:32.199 --> 26:32.852
Okay.

26:34.375 --> 26:36.769
I... I wake up early,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.248
and I go for a run,

26:38.379 --> 26:39.859
and then...

26:39.989 --> 26:41.425
I get a cappuccino nearby,

26:41.556 --> 26:43.210
maybe a really good croissant.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.299
Work.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.214
I go to a cafe after

26:47.344 --> 26:48.868
for, like, emails and whatever.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.565
Um...

26:50.696 --> 26:52.262
meet up with a friend or two

26:52.393 --> 26:53.829
for drinks and dinner,

26:53.960 --> 26:55.135
some place new and fun,

26:55.265 --> 26:58.094
and then home,

26:58.225 --> 26:59.052
settle in,

26:59.182 --> 27:00.009
watch TV,

27:00.140 --> 27:01.924
or...

27:02.055 --> 27:03.447
read in bed.

27:03.578 --> 27:04.797
[sighs]

27:04.927 --> 27:06.929
[Eddie]
And that's your perfect day?

27:07.060 --> 27:08.061
Yeah, more or less.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.324
Okay.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.152
Now, here's what I'm hearing.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.457
No husband,

27:13.588 --> 27:15.285
no kids,

27:15.416 --> 27:18.114
no visitors.

27:18.245 --> 27:19.420
Eh...

27:19.550 --> 27:21.204
just sayin'.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.078
I think I picked
the wrong perfect day.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.166
Oh, come on,

27:26.296 --> 27:27.646
he was trying to rent you
an apartment.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.475
I feel guilty.

27:31.606 --> 27:32.607
Why? You're here,

27:32.738 --> 27:33.956
so you're thinking about here.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.305
I have to go to the bathroom.

27:44.445 --> 27:45.664
Oh, shit.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.230
My husband.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.234
[woman laughing nervously]

27:51.365 --> 27:52.671
Shit.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.499
Hey!

27:55.630 --> 27:57.197
What a surprise, right?

27:57.327 --> 27:59.112
I know!

27:59.242 --> 28:01.636
How lucky.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.160
I had a client nearby.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.509
Ooh.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.511
Did you order yet?

28:07.642 --> 28:10.166
No, uh,
just waiting for a menu.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.168
Fantastic.
Okay, great.

28:12.299 --> 28:13.561
It's so good you're here.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.694
Everything okay... at work?

28:19.045 --> 28:20.655
Not really.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.439
It's a tough day for me, too.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.702
Yeah, looks like it.

28:26.487 --> 28:28.968
Well, I heard you say
that it was a good place...

28:29.098 --> 28:30.839
So, uh, Steve and Fiona

28:30.970 --> 28:33.537
invited us up to the Berkshires
this weekend.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.583
You know, their house
in the Berkshires.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.585
Uh-huh.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.762
So I'll just say that we're,
you know, too busy to go, or--

28:40.893 --> 28:41.763
I mean,
how nice is their house?

28:41.894 --> 28:42.764
It's a shithole.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.070
[laughs]

28:49.292 --> 28:49.989
Here we are!

28:50.119 --> 28:52.600
One Italian chopped salad,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.036
and one chicken penne.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.472
That's ours.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.865
I don't think so--

28:56.996 --> 28:58.214
No, that's definitely ours.
We ordered it.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.434
-Mm-hmm.
-Yup.

29:00.564 --> 29:01.609
[clears throat]

29:02.741 --> 29:04.612
Thanks.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.225
Looks tasty.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.881
Do you want to share, or--

29:14.796 --> 29:15.797
Actually, I want a divorce.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.322
But, uh...

29:19.453 --> 29:20.802
But-but why?

29:23.022 --> 29:24.850
Well, I feel like
you're not honest with me,

29:24.980 --> 29:26.242
or with anyone really.

29:26.373 --> 29:27.461
You know, I feel you're--

29:27.591 --> 29:29.506
you're a dishonest person.

29:29.637 --> 29:30.769
Uh, but-but that's not--

29:30.899 --> 29:32.074
Why are you doing this?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.206
And your erections are soft.

29:33.336 --> 29:34.642
Not always.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.122
And you're clingy.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.384
I mean, I can't even
have lunch on my own

29:37.514 --> 29:39.081
without you
having to be all over it.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.997
I thought you liked
having lunch with me.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.609
No, you know what?

29:45.740 --> 29:46.959
It's me.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.047
Yep.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.875
I'm just not fulfilled.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.661
You want to tell me why?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.446
You really wanna know?

29:56.577 --> 30:02.017
I'm not in the same place
as when we met.

30:02.148 --> 30:04.628
I've grown, or...

30:04.759 --> 30:07.762
or at least I'm trying,

30:07.893 --> 30:08.937
and I feel like you haven't...

30:11.113 --> 30:12.854
...or maybe
you're just starting,

30:12.985 --> 30:16.292
but, like,
it's a series of, like...

30:16.423 --> 30:17.554
false starts,

30:17.685 --> 30:20.427
and it never--
it never really goes anywhere,

30:20.557 --> 30:23.473
and...

30:23.604 --> 30:25.214
and I can't just keep...

30:25.345 --> 30:28.130
waiting,

30:28.261 --> 30:29.305
hoping,

30:29.436 --> 30:31.351
for no other reason
than to hope

30:31.481 --> 30:32.961
that we're going to--

30:33.092 --> 30:35.703
that we're going to be
in sync again, so...

30:35.834 --> 30:38.575
I have made some big decisions,

30:38.706 --> 30:40.447
and I'm starting to see

30:40.577 --> 30:43.493
that those decisions
don't involve you anymore,

30:43.624 --> 30:46.453
and I'm really sorry,

30:46.583 --> 30:48.847
but they just don't.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.067
So, um...

30:52.198 --> 30:55.505
am I going to go,
or are you?

30:58.073 --> 30:59.770
Oh, Jesus.

31:16.787 --> 31:17.484
There.

31:17.614 --> 31:18.833
Where are we?

31:18.964 --> 31:20.879
Just sit here, okay?

31:21.009 --> 31:22.881
Don't touch anything.

31:23.011 --> 31:23.882
Don't talk to anyone,

31:24.012 --> 31:25.709
and if you have to pee,

31:25.840 --> 31:26.623
don't.

31:26.754 --> 31:27.798
I'll be right back.

31:40.550 --> 31:41.682
[knocks briskly]

31:49.516 --> 31:50.604
I called the bar.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.736
They told me your shift ended
an hour ago.

31:52.867 --> 31:57.176
I know Billie told you
what I told her,

31:57.306 --> 31:59.743
I mean, about the classes.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.615
I'm sorry that I did that.

32:01.745 --> 32:02.485
I shouldn't have.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.359
I really don't want to talk
about this right now.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.100
Yeah.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.624
Hey, do you think
we can get past this?

32:10.754 --> 32:13.105
Because I want you to know
why I did it.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.019
'Cause I think you're better--

32:14.149 --> 32:15.977
It's just a bad time,
Hank, okay?

32:16.108 --> 32:16.978
Yeah.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.023
Yeah, all right.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.820
Russell?

32:32.951 --> 32:35.736
[Russell, from inside] Yeah?

32:46.573 --> 32:48.488
[whispering] Oh...

32:48.618 --> 32:51.273
Julie is worried about you.

32:51.404 --> 32:52.013
Dad, um--

32:52.144 --> 32:53.841
Just put your pants on.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.452
I'm going to take you home
to your wife.

33:05.766 --> 33:06.462
So, Gramps--

33:06.593 --> 33:07.986
No.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.426
CarMax!

33:13.556 --> 33:15.036
[Hank] What?

33:15.167 --> 33:15.950
CarMax!

33:16.081 --> 33:17.473
That's obviously not a CarMax--

33:17.604 --> 33:19.084
It's a car-looking place.

33:19.214 --> 33:20.215
You know what I'm talking about.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.173
No, it's fine. Leave it.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.043
-I'm not going in.
-Pull over!

33:22.174 --> 33:23.871
-Pull over!
-No, I don't want--

33:24.002 --> 33:25.220
All right, calm down!

33:25.351 --> 33:26.830
Calm down, I'm pulling in!

33:26.961 --> 33:27.875
[Russell laughing]

33:28.006 --> 33:28.876
No laughing!

33:29.007 --> 33:30.704
I'm not ready for you to laugh!

33:30.834 --> 33:31.879
What did he do?
What'd you do?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.315
He cheated on his wife.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.143
Bah! She'll be fine.

33:35.274 --> 33:38.103
All right,
you can look at the cars.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.453
You have as much time
as it takes me

33:40.583 --> 33:41.584
to try to pee.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.073
[cell phone buzzing]

33:55.729 --> 33:57.165
What?

33:57.296 --> 33:59.037
[Hank] You'll never believe
who I've got in my car.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.516
Is he with you?
Is he okay?

34:00.647 --> 34:01.691
Yeah.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.215
He's okay

34:03.345 --> 34:04.694
in the way that you mean it.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.305
Where was he?

34:06.435 --> 34:08.132
Well, I'll let him tell you.

34:08.263 --> 34:09.873
I'll have him home
in 20 minutes.

34:10.004 --> 34:10.918
Okay.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.005
Thank you.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.312
Bye.

34:17.228 --> 34:19.100
You know, you don't know
the whole story.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.364
I only know the dirty parts.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.801
It's just it's hard
with Julie sometimes.

34:24.931 --> 34:26.194
You don't know how she gets.

34:26.324 --> 34:28.675
I get excited
about this great idea,

34:28.804 --> 34:32.460
and all she does is tell me
all the reasons why it's stupid.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.116
Like, they thought Google
was a stupid idea

34:35.246 --> 34:37.118
until it made a million dollars.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.947
I just feel like sometimes--

34:41.079 --> 34:42.775
sometimes, I need somebody
in my corner

34:42.906 --> 34:44.690
who doesn't make me feel like
a complete loser.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.170
All right, well,

34:46.301 --> 34:48.129
maybe you need to find
a different corner.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.784
-What's this?
-[knocking on window]

34:50.914 --> 34:53.134
You're Henry's son, right?

34:53.264 --> 34:54.179
Yeah.

34:54.309 --> 34:55.353
Yeah, well, he's chosen a car,

34:55.484 --> 34:56.485
but, um, he's going to need
a co-signer.

34:56.616 --> 34:57.834
Uh, no.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.010
He-- He can't drive.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.664
and also,
the last thing he needs

35:01.795 --> 35:03.579
is my financial backing.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.015
Yeah, well,
he needs someone's.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.235
No credit,
unpaid credit-card bills,

35:07.366 --> 35:08.454
terrible credit rating,
no savings.

35:11.065 --> 35:13.372
This can't be right.

35:13.502 --> 35:15.113
What?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.247
[car horns honking]

35:22.076 --> 35:23.991
And she thinks you're a loser.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.384
[sighs]

35:27.560 --> 35:29.605
Get in.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.867
[Henry] Okay.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.434
[Hank]
You're not buying a car today.

35:32.565 --> 35:33.827
[Henry] Okay, okay.

35:35.742 --> 35:36.960
[line ringing]

35:37.091 --> 35:38.614
[Laurel] Hank, dear.
Where are you?

35:38.745 --> 35:39.876
Where is Henry?

35:40.007 --> 35:42.357
All right, I'm about to leave
a car dealership

35:42.488 --> 35:43.402
with my esteemed father.

35:43.532 --> 35:46.231
Did you know
that he is completely broke?

35:46.361 --> 35:47.667
[Laurel] Of course, I knew.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.277
Of course, you knew.

35:49.408 --> 35:51.105
All right, I'm putting you
on speaker phone

35:51.236 --> 35:52.976
so you and Dad can get
your stories straight.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.630
Go.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.545
[Laurel] Your father
is a very important man,

35:56.676 --> 35:58.634
the kind of man
who gets taken advantage of.

35:58.765 --> 35:59.983
It was Belinda.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.637
[Laurel] It was Melanie.

36:01.768 --> 36:02.986
A Joyce scholar.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.423
Zero originality.

36:04.553 --> 36:05.337
Let me guess.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.642
You cheated on her,

36:06.773 --> 36:08.427
more than once,

36:08.557 --> 36:11.473
so she got her revenge
by stealing all your money?

36:11.604 --> 36:14.694
My money wasn't
the only thing she stole.

36:14.824 --> 36:17.653
She plagiarized
my theory about Dubliners!

36:17.784 --> 36:19.307
The bitch.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.875
[Laurel] You're being
very unfair, Hank.

36:22.005 --> 36:23.137
Your father's in a crisis.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.399
We're his family.

36:24.530 --> 36:25.879
It's our duty
to take care of him--

36:26.009 --> 36:28.098
My duty is to go see
my daughter,

36:28.229 --> 36:29.709
and I'm going to do that
right now.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.014
[disconnects call]

36:31.145 --> 36:32.625
Give me that.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.249
Hey, Dad.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.381
Is he in the car?

36:49.511 --> 36:51.165
Honey, can we sit down?

36:51.296 --> 36:52.253
No.
Where is he?

36:54.777 --> 36:55.474
He ran away.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.172
Very funny.

36:58.303 --> 36:59.521
Can you tell me where he is?

36:59.652 --> 37:00.609
Julie, you were right.

37:00.740 --> 37:03.656
He was cheating on you.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.358
No.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.360
No, he can't,
he's not a good enough liar.

37:15.145 --> 37:16.277
You have to understand

37:16.408 --> 37:18.061
that guys like Russell, hon',

37:18.192 --> 37:19.933
they're-- they're small.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.196
He's my husband.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.633
I know it's hard to hear,

37:24.764 --> 37:26.461
but I want you to understand,
you know,

37:26.592 --> 37:27.462
so you're not wondering.

37:29.421 --> 37:32.728
He doesn't feel respected.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.252
He doesn't feel smart
around you--

37:34.382 --> 37:35.775
Stop. Stop.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.124
You're just making shit up.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.734
-He wasn't cheating on me!
-I'm not making-- No!

37:39.822 --> 37:40.606
Thank you.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.353
You're an Amazon Prime member?

37:48.483 --> 37:50.659
-That--
-Dad...

37:50.790 --> 37:52.487
-Doesn't that co--
-He wasn't cheating on me!

37:52.618 --> 37:55.795
Look, he's terrified
to face you, okay?

37:55.925 --> 37:56.752
He's a little boy.

37:56.883 --> 37:57.797
Can he even grow a beard?

37:57.927 --> 38:00.147
Why are you taking his side?

38:00.278 --> 38:01.627
I'm not taking his side.

38:01.757 --> 38:05.544
I'm just making excuses for him,
his excuses.

38:05.674 --> 38:08.024
I didn't say--
I'm saying them, but--

38:08.155 --> 38:11.158
[car horn honking]

38:11.289 --> 38:12.812
You left Grandpa in the car?

38:12.942 --> 38:14.335
He's fine.

38:14.466 --> 38:15.336
He can fiddle with the knobs.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.207
It's a wonderland for him.

38:22.343 --> 38:24.171
Where is the fiction section?

38:24.302 --> 38:26.478
Uh, this is not a bookstore.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.741
I saw some paperbacks
over there.

38:28.871 --> 38:31.700
Okay, well,
that's the fiction section.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.137
We had better libraries
at Columbia.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.792
Right, right,

38:36.923 --> 38:40.143
but did Columbia
have a plumbing aisle?

38:40.274 --> 38:42.755
Well, where's your assistant,
the boy?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.147
What boy?
