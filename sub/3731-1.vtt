Oh...

05:09.469 --> 05:12.638
It's painful. I can feel it.

so much work to be done.

and cuddle up in my arms.

done nothing like this in their lives.

and she started bleeding bad.

There was blood everywhere,

- They knew about my sister.
- Knew.

with this chemical, DMT.

their death, worlds beyond this one.

- Dad, you know work is important to me.
- I know.

You sent me to university to get a degree,
not to find a husband.

- I know.
- I heard thunder, and rain.

17:42.096 --> 17:44.849

was the sound of your father's tears,

to give his daughter away.

pleasure... the money, or seeing his face.

23:14.928 --> 23:17.139
And you're a liar. You're a liar.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.934
I'm Tino El Caído.

23:23.645 --> 23:24.688
[sighs]

23:24.771 --> 23:27.316
I'm Tino El Caído. I'm the fallen one.

23:27.399 --> 23:29.276
Diet Coke, please!

23:30.152 --> 23:33.489
What happened in my past nobody knows,
not the writers, not the directors.

23:33.572 --> 23:36.700
I'm a man-- Bah! Bah-pah!

23:36.783 --> 23:39.328
[slurping]

23:39.411 --> 23:42.039
A man with a haunted past,
that's what the script says.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.793
Bah-bah! [low vocalizing]

23:51.048 --> 23:52.841
[sighing] What are you doing to me?

23:52.924 --> 23:55.177
[whispers indistinctly]

23:57.971 --> 24:01.808
- [knocking at door]
- Yeah?

24:03.101 --> 24:04.603
Hey.

24:04.686 --> 24:06.188
Hey.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.525
Just checking everything is OK.

24:09.608 --> 24:11.235
Yeah.

24:11.318 --> 24:12.694
- Yeah?
- Everything's OK.

24:12.777 --> 24:15.322
I just thought maybe
I did something wrong.

24:15.406 --> 24:18.950
No, no. Please, no.
You were great. You were fantastic.

24:19.034 --> 24:22.120
It was me that, you know, I...

24:24.789 --> 24:26.791
You're just always so perfect.

24:27.918 --> 24:30.295
I don't know what is going on with me.

24:43.016 --> 24:45.436
Maybe there's something
that I can help you with?

24:46.311 --> 24:48.397
[exhales]

24:48.480 --> 24:51.483
[belt buckle jingling]

24:53.860 --> 24:55.153
Wait, wait.

24:55.237 --> 24:56.655
Wait, Cassandra.

24:57.573 --> 24:59.699
There is nothing I'd like more.

25:02.536 --> 25:04.996
If only my heart
did not belong to another.

25:09.167 --> 25:10.877
[sighs]

25:10.961 --> 25:12.212
I'm sorry.

25:13.964 --> 25:17.801
- [sighs]
- She's a very lucky woman.

25:19.094 --> 25:21.138
I'm sorry. I...

25:22.806 --> 25:24.182
I'm sorry.

25:29.146 --> 25:30.355
[door slams]

25:46.580 --> 25:49.625
Thank you for coming.
It means a lot to us.

25:50.834 --> 25:52.085
Sorry, Auntie.

26:00.885 --> 26:03.430
Last few days,
all he talked about was your father.

26:04.348 --> 26:07.559
Saddest day in his life,
the day your father died.

26:07.643 --> 26:11.188
You should go say hello.
We'll wait for you.

26:12.314 --> 26:15.942
Pay your respects. He was your father.

26:43.470 --> 26:45.013

[whistles]

27:21.341 --> 27:22.884
[speaks foreign language]

27:27.431 --> 27:29.015
- Yes?
- When are we leaving?

27:29.099 --> 27:30.934
- Right now.
- I have to be downtown by nine.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.644
You'll be there long before nine, Ma'am.

27:32.728 --> 27:35.355
Come rain or shine,
Van Damn is always on time.

27:35.439 --> 27:37.566
- We need to go.
- We need more customers.

27:37.649 --> 27:39.150
We're barely covering the cost of gas.

27:39.234 --> 27:41.361
We don't need customers,
we need a Facebook page.

27:41.445 --> 27:42.821
- Look at this.
- [sighs] Jela.

27:42.904 --> 27:44.281
[engine starting]

27:44.364 --> 27:45.616
[moans]

27:49.202 --> 27:52.539
Every day is the same.
Everybody loves Bat Van.

27:52.623 --> 27:56.501
You dumb fucks!
No one gives a shit about Van Damn!

27:56.585 --> 27:59.129
[cackling]

28:02.882 --> 28:04.718
[sighs]

28:04.802 --> 28:06.804
- Maybe he's right.
- No.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.347
- Maybe Jean-Claude's time is over.
- No! Never!

28:09.431 --> 28:11.975
Come on, Capheus,
Van Damme is a man.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.436
He doesn't need costumes
and gadgets to fight.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.647
He fights with the fist
and with his heart.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.899
Come on!
The Muscles from Brussels never die.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.192
Don't forget that.

28:22.986 --> 28:24.822
- Come on.
- [speaks foreign language]

28:24.904 --> 28:26.782
- And get us more customers.
- I will.

28:26.865 --> 28:28.992
- [man] Excuse me.
- Whoo! [laughs]

28:29.075 --> 28:31.953
Jean Claude is watching over us.
Yes, sir, are you going to the city?

28:32.036 --> 28:33.497
- Yes, please.
- Then take a seat.

28:33.580 --> 28:37.250
- No, but I've got no money.
- Um... Everyone must pay.

28:38.376 --> 28:41.171
- Here.
- What am I supposed to do with this?

28:41.254 --> 28:42.714
This is worth more than the fare.

28:44.924 --> 28:48.178
Look, I believe you, but how
do I return change out of a chicken?

28:48.261 --> 28:50.138
- Save me an egg.
- [chicken squawking]

28:50.221 --> 28:52.349

29:08.699 --> 29:12.661
[woman] Ms. Bak, I have Mr. Jong
from Seoul Citibank on the line again.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.834
[Sun] Tell Mr. Jong that I'm in a meeting.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.808
[sighs]

29:37.686 --> 29:41.105
[indistinct chatter]

29:43.149 --> 29:45.736
Hang on. Riley! Hey!

29:46.528 --> 29:48.279
Me and Nocker have been waitin' for you.

29:49.113 --> 29:51.324
Sorry. I thought you'd gone already.

29:53.577 --> 29:55.495
Nyx has invited us up to his place.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.749
Oh, look, maybe tomorrow, OK?

29:59.958 --> 30:01.585
Riles, this is important.

30:01.668 --> 30:04.838
Look, this headache is killing me.

30:04.922 --> 30:06.590
Tomorrow, OK?

30:07.507 --> 30:09.050
OK...

30:09.133 --> 30:13.263
The stuff that he's talking about,
that is exactly what you need.

30:15.265 --> 30:18.309
[voice echoes indistinctly]

30:26.067 --> 30:29.320
[rock music playing]

30:54.638 --> 30:56.431
Oh! [laughing]

30:56.514 --> 30:57.975
Whoo! [laughs]

30:58.016 --> 31:00.518
- Hi!
- Remember your first brownie?

31:00.602 --> 31:02.103
Our first Pride.

31:05.315 --> 31:11.237
Your lips... are so... amazing.

31:11.321 --> 31:14.115
My God, we were so high.

31:14.198 --> 31:16.994
- [both giggling]
- Oh, my God, we were.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.662
[man] Are you following me?

31:18.787 --> 31:21.999
- Need some delicious, nutritious stuff?
- Um...

31:22.081 --> 31:23.583
Maybe this is what you need.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.502
- [man] Yeah.
- OK, OK, we'll take one.

31:25.585 --> 31:26.670
[man 1] Yeah. All right.

31:26.753 --> 31:27.963
- [man 2] Go for it.
- How much?

31:28.046 --> 31:29.297
You'll never be the same again.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.133
- OK, OK. OK, OK.
- Thank you very much.

31:32.216 --> 31:33.259
Happy journey.

31:33.343 --> 31:34.761
- Happy Pride!
- Happy Pride!

31:34.845 --> 31:36.262
Bye!

31:37.472 --> 31:38.682
[giggles]

31:40.934 --> 31:43.020
[both] Mm...

31:44.312 --> 31:45.897
[sighs]

31:47.858 --> 31:50.485
But you know what I remember best
about that day?

31:52.195 --> 31:54.614
[pop music playing]

31:57.200 --> 32:00.037
[giggling]

32:00.954 --> 32:03.373
Hey, y'all, this is the one
I've been talking about.

32:03.456 --> 32:07.335
Wait, I know you. You're the tranny
that blogs about politics.

32:08.252 --> 32:10.797
I totally disagree with what you said
about dropping LGBT.

32:10.881 --> 32:14.551
- Hey, come on, relax. It's a party.
- We fought hard for that recognition.

32:14.634 --> 32:16.928
I just thought that the distinctions
were separating us.

32:17.012 --> 32:20.891
Bullshit. Just another colonizing male
trying to take up any space left to women.

32:20.974 --> 32:22.767
Sam, say one more thing
about my girlfriend

32:22.851 --> 32:24.477
and I will colonize your face
with my fist.

32:24.561 --> 32:25.770
- Oh, yeah?
- I'm gonna go.

32:25.854 --> 32:27.814
Oh, please.
She's a loud-mouth Berkeley bitch.

32:27.898 --> 32:29.399
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

32:29.482 --> 32:31.109
Hey, No-- Nomi!

32:32.027 --> 32:36.656
Wait! Honey, what is it?
You never cry at stuff like that.

32:39.659 --> 32:41.703
I'm not crying because of her.

32:43.121 --> 32:44.330
Then what?

32:44.414 --> 32:48.251
I'm crying because
no one's ever defended me before.

32:55.717 --> 32:57.468
Mwah!

32:58.511 --> 33:01.014
That's the day I knew
I'd always love you.

33:08.521 --> 33:11.900
[overlapping chatter]

33:11.983 --> 33:14.318
[bell rings nearby]

33:20.450 --> 33:21.993
[tolls]

33:25.622 --> 33:27.415
My Lord Ganesha.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.088
I hope you like this modak.

33:33.171 --> 33:35.214
I made it especially for you.

33:36.591 --> 33:39.052
I put peanuts on top. [chuckles]

33:40.137 --> 33:45.142
I mean, of course, these gifts come
without any attachments or obligations.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.769
I am trying to become a better person.

33:47.852 --> 33:52.149
I know I am not important enough
to deserve your attention

33:52.231 --> 33:56.235
when there are so many terrible things
wrong in this world.

33:58.155 --> 34:01.365
I can't tell you how bad I feel
even being here,

34:01.449 --> 34:05.120
because I know I shouldn't be
asking you this.

34:08.790 --> 34:11.250
But I have no one else to turn to.

34:14.462 --> 34:17.465
OK, um... this weekend,

34:17.548 --> 34:23.013
I am to marry a very important man,
who you probably know, Rajan Rasal.

34:23.096 --> 34:27.851
Um, he is the son of the owner of
the pharmaceutical company where I work.

34:27.934 --> 34:30.269
He's very smart and very handsome,

34:30.353 --> 34:34.649
and all the women at the company
want desperately to marry him,

34:34.732 --> 34:37.235
but he never took an interest in anyone...

34:38.069 --> 34:39.904
except me.

34:41.198 --> 34:45.243
I should tell you, I have never
seen my parents so full of joy

34:45.326 --> 34:48.329
as when they received his proposal.

34:48.412 --> 34:53.584
I mean, I thought they were excited
when I received my degree from university.

34:54.377 --> 34:57.588
Maybe you saw my dad, like,
dancing around the house.

34:58.589 --> 35:00.050
[sighs]

35:02.260 --> 35:04.095
How could I say no?

35:06.181 --> 35:11.186
I mean, Rajan is, according to everyone,
including my mom's astrologer,

35:11.269 --> 35:13.563
the perfect husband for me.

35:17.358 --> 35:19.736
Except for one little fact.

35:22.739 --> 35:23.948
[sighs]

35:27.994 --> 35:29.829
I do not love him.

35:30.830 --> 35:32.707
[whirring]

35:33.875 --> 35:39.756
After you left the funeral...
Sergei started blowing on about your dad.

35:41.549 --> 35:47.097
Said there wasn't a better box man
in the world than your dad, now or ever.

35:48.806 --> 35:50.725
Said the only reason your dad got caught

35:50.808 --> 35:55.730
was because he was obsessed
with trying to crack an S&D safe.

35:55.813 --> 35:58.108
Said they're uncrackable.

35:59.901 --> 36:02.403
Said your father was an idiot for trying.

36:07.450 --> 36:09.077
You sure that gets us in?

36:09.160 --> 36:11.621
Am I sure?
You notice the sign outside?

36:13.998 --> 36:15.416
See you tomorrow.

36:16.709 --> 36:18.753
Wolfgang?

36:18.836 --> 36:22.257
The safe in the house,
it's one of them S&D's, isn't it?

36:23.841 --> 36:25.676
[groans]

36:25.760 --> 36:28.346
- [dance music playing]
- Give 'til it hearts, baby.

36:28.429 --> 36:29.847
My box needs filling!

36:30.807 --> 36:32.225
Mm, thank you, baby.

36:32.309 --> 36:34.227
Hi!

36:34.311 --> 36:37.021
- Oh!
- Wow, she is amazing.

36:37.105 --> 36:39.274
Neets loves her charity work.

36:42.277 --> 36:44.528
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, my God, of course.

36:44.612 --> 36:49.075
- We're so excited to see your new piece.
- A bit nervous about it, actually.

36:49.159 --> 36:53.537
- Why?
- Well, it's kind of a downer.

36:53.621 --> 36:57.000
- So?
- This is Pride. People want to feel good.

36:57.917 --> 36:59.336
I don't.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.839
During the '80s,
Pride was a funeral march.

37:02.922 --> 37:06.176
I know. I want to remember that.
I want to connect to that.

37:06.259 --> 37:09.346
I want to show people
how my life and all of this

37:09.428 --> 37:12.473
is made possible
by those lives and those deaths.

37:16.353 --> 37:19.272
[solemn cello music plays]

37:19.356 --> 37:23.567
[man] I walked in the room
and saw a man in his early 30s

37:23.651 --> 37:26.154
who looked like he was 92,

37:26.237 --> 37:30.491
who was skin and bones,
who weighed maybe 80 pounds,

37:30.574 --> 37:32.451
who was on a respirator.

37:32.535 --> 37:37.623
[sighs] And, uh... [voice breaking]
and he said, he said to me...

37:39.500 --> 37:41.919
"Do me this--
You've gotta do me a favor."

37:42.003 --> 37:44.547
And I said, "Whatever it is, just ask."

37:45.631 --> 37:48.385
And he said, "I can't go on like this."

37:48.467 --> 37:54.307
He said, "You know, I just--
If you could, just carry me up to the roof

37:54.391 --> 37:57.268
and throw me over the... roof."

37:57.352 --> 38:03.858
He goes, "I only weigh about 80 pounds,
and you're strong, you could do it."

38:03.941 --> 38:08.196
And then I said, "Jay, I can't do that.
You can't ask that of me."

38:09.822 --> 38:16.079
And when he died, they came in...
in hazmat... [voice breaks] suits,

38:16.162 --> 38:18.831
and they put him in a body bag.

38:22.877 --> 38:25.004
[cello music fades]

38:25.796 --> 38:29.050
[heartbeat rhythm]

38:41.771 --> 38:44.441
[applause]

39:03.334 --> 39:04.835
It's like I was there.

39:04.919 --> 39:07.546
I could feel the wind coming in
through the broken windows.

39:09.173 --> 39:13.511
The smell of burnt mattress.
It didn't seem like a dream.

39:13.594 --> 39:16.389
Maybe you were astro-projecting,
like Dr. Strange.

39:16.473 --> 39:18.808
Why would I expect anything
different from you?

39:18.891 --> 39:21.602
- Officer Strange.
- Fuck off.

39:21.685 --> 39:24.939
Officer Strange. Whoo!
That's your name.

39:28.651 --> 39:31.154
[indistinct taunting]

39:36.367 --> 39:37.494
Every time I come down here,

39:37.576 --> 39:40.538
I remember how much you can
actually feel how much they hate us.

39:40.621 --> 39:45.251
Gangbangers hate cops,
cops hate gangbangers. It's natural.

39:45.335 --> 39:46.836
How's that natural?

39:48.004 --> 39:51.674
[train passing overhead]

39:54.177 --> 39:58.097
Like dogs hate cats.
They're the enemy.

39:59.474 --> 40:02.018
You certainly got
plenty of reason to hate them.

40:02.101 --> 40:03.853
After what they did to your old man?

40:04.645 --> 40:07.148
Shit, I'd never forgive
something like that.

40:08.566 --> 40:11.402
[man over radio] One-Adam-12,
we have a report of gunfire.

40:11.486 --> 40:13.154
Eleven-12, 10-4.

40:14.197 --> 40:17.325
With any luck,
there'll be a few less cats in the world.

40:17.408 --> 40:19.202
- Let's get 'em, cowboy.
- [siren wailing]

40:22.580 --> 40:24.999
[door unlocks]

40:25.082 --> 40:27.460
Open sesame.

40:31.130 --> 40:32.715
[beeps]

41:06.957 --> 41:08.292
[siren wailing]

41:08.376 --> 41:12.171
- [tires screech]
- [horn honks]

41:14.131 --> 41:16.675
[siren continues, faint]

41:16.759 --> 41:18.469
Was that a siren?

41:19.554 --> 41:22.056
Huh? Didn't hear anything.

41:26.477 --> 41:28.229
You know I brought a drill.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.110
There's no shame in drilling.

41:35.069 --> 41:37.280
[mutters softly]

41:37.363 --> 41:40.241
[soft clicking]

41:43.327 --> 41:47.331
- [music plays indistinctly on headphones]
- [soft clicking continues]

41:51.419 --> 41:55.465
- [music continues on headphones]
- [siren wailing in distance]

42:06.767 --> 42:09.103
[siren continues in distance]

42:11.063 --> 42:14.233
- [siren wailing]
- [tires screech]

42:14.942 --> 42:16.402
[siren stops]

42:17.320 --> 42:18.862
[gunfire]

42:20.030 --> 42:21.699
Shots fired. Requesting backup.

42:52.271 --> 42:53.481
[gasping breaths]

43:03.199 --> 43:04.450
Help me.

43:11.457 --> 43:13.543
- [man] What happened?
- [boy panting]

43:13.626 --> 43:16.629
Gunshot wound. Looks like a hollow point.

43:19.131 --> 43:21.551
- Get an ambulance.
- What?

43:21.634 --> 43:24.721
- You heard me.
- What do you think this is, TV?

43:24.803 --> 43:27.640
Ain't no ambulance coming to Chi-raq
for a gunshot.

43:28.391 --> 43:30.267
Not fast enough
to make a difference anyway.

43:33.437 --> 43:35.314
The fuck you doing, Gorski?

43:35.398 --> 43:37.775
Hey. What's your name, kid?

43:37.858 --> 43:40.737
- Deshawn.
- Deshawn, I'm Will.

43:41.696 --> 43:44.699
I need you to press this
as hard as you can.

43:44.782 --> 43:46.909
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Press as hard as you can.

43:49.828 --> 43:51.789
- Are you kidding me?
- [Will grunts]

43:51.872 --> 43:54.958
I know you, Diego. You do not want to
stand there and let this kid die either.

43:55.042 --> 43:56.794
That's what he'd do if it was you or me.

44:01.549 --> 44:03.551
Goddamnit.

44:03.634 --> 44:05.052
[soft clicking]

44:15.187 --> 44:16.647
Fifty-eight minutes.

44:17.147 --> 44:18.691
[exhales]

44:26.031 --> 44:28.117
Fuck.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.786
[exhales]

44:32.955 --> 44:34.832
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

44:37.752 --> 44:40.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:40.337 --> 44:41.714
What's this?

44:41.798 --> 44:43.257
We're throwing in the towel?

44:44.216 --> 44:45.426
I need a break.

44:46.385 --> 44:48.345
Hey, you understand
we got less than an hour,

44:48.429 --> 44:51.515
unless I'm wrong and Steiner's early,
then we got less than that.

44:51.599 --> 44:53.976
You're never wrong about shit like that.

44:55.686 --> 44:58.606
- [dance music plays on TV]
- [audience cheers]

44:58.689 --> 45:00.274
Really?

45:02.819 --> 45:04.069
[whispers] Really?

45:05.738 --> 45:07.239
It relaxes me.

45:08.866 --> 45:10.951
This shit relaxes you?

45:13.912 --> 45:16.290
- [siren wailing]
- [tires screeching]

45:19.084 --> 45:21.671
- Hang on.
- [tires screeching]

45:21.754 --> 45:24.047
[panting, moans]

45:24.131 --> 45:26.592
- [Will] You OK?
- Just a little cold.

45:31.263 --> 45:33.808
[boy] This your first time
in the back seat, Will?

45:33.891 --> 45:35.852
I've been back here more times
than I care to admit.

45:35.934 --> 45:39.271
[groans] Are you some sort of
gangsta cop or somethin'?

45:39.396 --> 45:43.108
Old man's police. Had my fair share
of teenage rebellion, I guess.

45:44.401 --> 45:47.655
Never met my dad.
He was shot before I was born.

45:50.491 --> 45:53.952
[woman sings slow song on TV]

45:57.331 --> 46:00.000
This girl, she's really good.

46:01.335 --> 46:04.338
Her name's Natalie.
I watched her last week.

46:04.463 --> 46:07.090
She sings like a musical instrument.

46:07.216 --> 46:10.887
She uses a language of pure emotion.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.055
Yeah, yeah, she's good.

46:17.226 --> 46:20.646
- She's never gonna win.
- Why?

46:20.730 --> 46:25.651
Her eyes are too close together.
She looks like a camel.

46:28.654 --> 46:30.030
[Wolfgang] Shut up.

46:31.407 --> 46:32.991
Camel's never gonna win.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.328
Never.

46:40.082 --> 46:42.543
- [low murmurs in audience]
- [woman whispers] Wolfgang.

46:45.588 --> 46:48.382
[sings in German]

46:51.218 --> 46:52.553
[woman whispers] Wolfgang.

46:54.137 --> 46:56.557
[woman sings in German]

46:56.640 --> 46:57.641
[sighs]

47:10.112 --> 47:12.698
[laughs]

47:23.375 --> 47:26.545
[audience applauding on TV]

47:29.006 --> 47:30.967
- [sighs]
- Told you.

47:34.762 --> 47:36.555
[sighs]

47:56.116 --> 47:58.535
- [cracking knuckles]
- [exhales]

48:11.632 --> 48:13.467
[tires screeching]

48:18.889 --> 48:20.474
[boy panting]

48:21.892 --> 48:24.520
Emergency! Kid's bleeding bad here.

48:24.603 --> 48:26.480
- That's a gunshot.
- Yeah, I know.

48:26.563 --> 48:28.774
- I'm sorry, we can't treat that here.
- What?

48:28.858 --> 48:32.528
Are you new? You need to go and get
an ambulance and take him to Mt. Sinai.

48:32.653 --> 48:34.655
The kid's gonna be dead
before we get there.

48:34.738 --> 48:38.701
- I'm sorry. It's policy.
- What kind of policy lets a kid die?

48:38.826 --> 48:41.119
We were losing so many
resources to gunshots,

48:41.203 --> 48:44.164
we couldn't take care of all the other
patients that needed help around here.

48:44.247 --> 48:47.960
We've been a better hospital
since we stopped taking kids like him.

48:48.044 --> 48:51.088
- [boy panting]
- [Will] Please.

48:53.256 --> 48:54.174
Please.

49:05.477 --> 49:08.064
[watch beeping]

49:12.526 --> 49:13.861
That's it.

49:14.695 --> 49:17.322
Fuck. It's over. Hey.

49:19.491 --> 49:22.703
[soft clicking]

49:40.512 --> 49:42.139
Shit.

49:42.222 --> 49:44.182
It's Steiner! We gotta go.

49:44.349 --> 49:46.268
Hey, Wolfgang.

49:46.351 --> 49:47.519
Please.

49:47.603 --> 49:49.187
He's going to fucking kill us.

49:49.271 --> 49:50.856
I don't want to die!

49:54.192 --> 49:56.070
[soft clicking continues]

50:16.132 --> 50:17.257
[clicking]

50:19.342 --> 50:20.677
[exhaling]

50:36.735 --> 50:40.280
- You cracked the uncrackable.
- [sighs]

50:41.615 --> 50:42.950
You did it.

50:44.743 --> 50:46.036
Yeah.

50:47.079 --> 50:48.122
OK.

50:59.883 --> 51:01.010
[beeps]

51:10.644 --> 51:12.146
[grunts]

51:28.578 --> 51:33.250
Dr. Manno just came out of surgery.
Life signs are stable.

51:33.333 --> 51:34.960
He'll probably make it.

51:35.044 --> 51:36.170
OK.

51:37.671 --> 51:38.672
Thanks.

51:38.755 --> 51:40.799
Can I ask you a personal question?

51:42.759 --> 51:46.638
If he lives and he kills someone,
let's say a cop,

51:46.722 --> 51:48.515
how you gonna feel about that?

51:52.186 --> 51:55.189
[soft, mid-tempo music playing]

51:58.525 --> 52:00.694
[no audible dialogue]

53:33.662 --> 53:35.705
[music continues over headphones]

53:38.667 --> 53:39.960
You all right?

53:42.504 --> 53:43.880
You're sweating.

53:51.554 --> 53:54.057
- Your pulse is racing.
- I'm fine.

53:54.141 --> 53:55.558
You're scared.

53:57.227 --> 53:58.561
You needn't be.

54:01.564 --> 54:02.858
You're so beautiful.

54:03.942 --> 54:05.944
I don't just mean in a physical way.

54:07.154 --> 54:11.116
The warmth... pouring out of your heart.

54:13.994 --> 54:16.205
Even though you work hard to hide it.

54:22.794 --> 54:24.838
You don't belong with these men.

54:26.506 --> 54:28.591
You know it's true.

54:30.427 --> 54:31.553
Don't you?

54:35.807 --> 54:38.101
I used to be like you.

54:40.437 --> 54:44.566
Like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth.

54:47.152 --> 54:49.946
I used anything I could to insulate.

54:50.030 --> 54:54.701
Music... books... booze.

54:54.784 --> 55:00.374
Anything I could to keep myself
separate from the rest of the world.

55:02.876 --> 55:05.462
Eventually I felt protected,
you know, I...

55:07.047 --> 55:08.424
I felt safe.

55:12.428 --> 55:14.012
But also...

55:16.181 --> 55:20.727
I never felt so... completely alone.

55:24.398 --> 55:29.819
Then one day a friend, she gave me a gift.

55:29.903 --> 55:32.197
She took away my armor.

55:32.281 --> 55:34.491
She tore down my walls.

55:35.784 --> 55:40.497
Her gift... it reminded me

55:40.580 --> 55:44.667
what it felt like... to be alive.

55:49.589 --> 55:51.425
What did she give you?

55:52.759 --> 55:54.010
This.

56:13.613 --> 56:14.948
[flicks lighter]

56:23.165 --> 56:25.459
[inhaling]

56:30.922 --> 56:34.092
[exhales, breathes deeply]

56:53.236 --> 56:57.657
[slow, ethereal music plays]

57:02.745 --> 57:05.541
[no audible dialogue]

58:51.187 --> 58:52.981
- Stop the car.
- Hm?

58:53.064 --> 58:55.692
- I said stop the car!
- What the fuck?

59:02.532 --> 59:04.367
This is where it happened.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.161
What happened?

59:08.121 --> 59:10.081
It's where she killed herself.

59:13.209 --> 59:15.003
[mutters] Shit.

59:40.028 --> 59:41.237
This is it.

59:41.321 --> 59:43.239
Ah, hell no.

59:43.365 --> 59:45.158
This wasn't a dream.

59:45.241 --> 59:48.203
Of all the partners,
I end up with a Mulder-wannabe.

59:49.746 --> 59:53.041
- D, a woman killed herself right here.
- Where's the blood, Will?

59:53.208 --> 59:55.669
Maybe she only shot herself
in the fifth dimension,

59:55.752 --> 59:56.919
so we can't see the blood.

59:57.003 --> 59:59.255
OK, I've never been here before.

1:00:03.719 --> 1:00:05.428
I know about this.

1:00:05.512 --> 1:00:07.180
Drugs.

1:00:08.682 --> 1:00:10.892
There's a gun, too.

1:00:10.975 --> 1:00:12.268
There's shit everywhere, man.

1:00:12.352 --> 1:00:14.479
Look, you're freakin' me out.

1:00:16.064 --> 1:00:19.359
Show me evidence of a crime,
and you got me.

1:00:19.442 --> 1:00:25.948
So, until then, do your little séance,
and I'll be in the car. All right?

1:00:55.353 --> 1:00:57.480
Uh... Hi.

1:01:00.983 --> 1:01:02.860
This is where she died.

1:01:03.986 --> 1:01:05.739
Did you know her?

1:01:08.450 --> 1:01:10.326
How do you know she died here?

1:01:11.911 --> 1:01:13.455
I saw her.

1:01:14.831 --> 1:01:16.583
Do you live here?

1:01:19.711 --> 1:01:21.713
Where do you live?

1:01:21.797 --> 1:01:23.799
London.

1:01:26.342 --> 1:01:27.594
What are you doing here?

1:01:27.719 --> 1:01:29.721
I don't know.

1:01:30.555 --> 1:01:32.140
[gasps]

1:01:32.223 --> 1:01:33.809
I don't know where I am.

1:01:33.891 --> 1:01:37.437
Chicago, near South Side.

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:39.188
In America?

1:01:42.442 --> 1:01:44.611
I've never been to America.

1:01:48.824 --> 1:01:52.160
[gasps]
Oh, no! What are you doing?

1:01:52.952 --> 1:01:55.204
- Don't you fucking move!
- [gasping]

1:01:56.331 --> 1:01:57.248
[screams]

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.753
- Stop.
- Open the fucking safe!

1:02:07.843 --> 1:02:08.844
Why are you doing this?

1:02:08.926 --> 1:02:13.306
He has just had a shipment come in,
and me and Nocker have been trackin' it.

1:02:13.389 --> 1:02:16.267
We were gonna hit him yesterday,
but he wanted you here.

1:02:17.977 --> 1:02:19.896
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.

1:02:21.022 --> 1:02:25.652
Now, a smart guy like you...
probably has a gun in there.

1:02:25.735 --> 1:02:29.280
- [gasps] Don't hurt him.
- Oh, yeah.

1:02:30.281 --> 1:02:33.785
Is that why you came? 'Cause you wanna--
Do you wanna fuck him?

1:02:33.869 --> 1:02:35.119
[sharp breath]

1:02:36.162 --> 1:02:40.750
Riles, he will kill you without blinking
if I didn't have this.

1:02:43.670 --> 1:02:45.714
- I fuckin' told you. Here.
- I have to go.

1:02:45.797 --> 1:02:49.551
No, no, no, no, no. Riley. You're not--
You're not going anywhere.

1:02:49.634 --> 1:02:51.887
- You're part of this. No, no, no.
- [panting] Let me go.

1:02:52.011 --> 1:02:57.099
Riles, Riles... this is the break
that we've been waiting for.

1:02:58.142 --> 1:02:59.769
Fill it up.

1:03:03.272 --> 1:03:04.524
Fill it up!

1:03:07.819 --> 1:03:11.322
Riles, this is our chance.

1:03:11.447 --> 1:03:16.411
You said that you wanted to go to America.
We wanted a different life.

1:03:16.494 --> 1:03:19.622
That's-- That's what you said, right?

1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:22.500
