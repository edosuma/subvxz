00:06.000 --> 00:08.210
Hey. Yolanda,
can you come downstairs

00:08.210 --> 00:09.920
and help me with
the rest of the groceries?

00:09.920 --> 00:12.290
You got two arms, bitch.

00:12.290 --> 00:15.250
No... I'm sorry. I've been
on this diet for three days.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.710
-I'm a little hangry.
-Great. So you'll help me?

00:17.710 --> 00:19.380
You got two ears, bitch,
I said no.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.290
(quietly)
Yolanda...

00:24.290 --> 00:26.580
Yolanda,
we have a situation.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.620
Alan's leaving you
for someone thinner?

00:29.620 --> 00:31.830
-No.
-Smarter?

00:31.830 --> 00:33.210
Taller?

00:33.210 --> 00:35.290
Someone with a house?

00:35.290 --> 00:38.250
-Someone with a neck?
-Stop!

00:38.250 --> 00:39.830
It's about Josh.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.210
While I was working
on his computer,

00:41.210 --> 00:43.040
an e-mail came in,
from his father.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.460
-What?
-I don't know what to do.

00:44.460 --> 00:46.080
Josh doesn't wanna
hear from the man

00:46.080 --> 00:47.790
who got his mama pregnant
then ran off,

00:47.790 --> 00:49.290
and neither do I.

00:49.290 --> 00:50.460
Read it out loud.

00:52.170 --> 00:54.000
"Josh, I have a lot of regrets
in my life,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.250
"none bigger than
not being a part of yours.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.710
"I'm flying in for the weekend

00:57.710 --> 01:00.170
and there's nothing I want more
than to meet my son."

01:00.170 --> 01:03.120
Oh, hell no.
That man missed his chance.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.670
Delete that.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.670
But it's his father,

01:06.670 --> 01:08.830
and this might be
the one opportunity for us

01:08.830 --> 01:11.170
to find out if Josh
will be hot when he's older.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.120
Hey. What are you two
whispering about?

01:15.120 --> 01:17.380
(giggles nervously)
Uh, hot older men.

01:17.380 --> 01:20.670
Oh, that's easy.
Sean Connery. Number one.

01:20.670 --> 01:23.750
Hypothetically,
if Sean Connery
were your father,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.880
how would you feel
if he contacted you?

01:25.880 --> 01:27.250
How would you think I'd feel?

01:27.250 --> 01:29.250
(à la Sean Connery)
Shaken, not stirred.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.380
Now, hypothetically,

01:34.380 --> 01:36.750
what if it wasn't Sean Connery

01:36.750 --> 01:38.460
but your actual dad
who wants to meet,

01:38.460 --> 01:40.290
and he's flying in tonight

01:40.290 --> 01:43.120
on hypothetical
Delta Flight 48L.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.080
Wow, that's a very
specific hypothetical.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.620
Hypothetically,

01:47.620 --> 01:49.080
I'd have no interest
in meeting him

01:49.080 --> 01:50.580
because he never had
any interest in meeting me.

01:50.580 --> 01:52.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.040
Hypothetically, you wouldn't
want to meet your dad

01:54.040 --> 01:55.790
if he was reaching out to you
after all these years?

01:55.790 --> 01:57.290
I don't wanna meet
the bastard who bolted

01:57.290 --> 01:59.080
'cause he didn't have
the balls to raise his son.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.170
So hypothetically,
this whole conversation's over.

02:02.830 --> 02:03.960
Ooh.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.790
Wow, I can't believe
how upset he got.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.000
Good thing
this was hypothetical.

Hey, Yolanda,
how's the diet going?

02:32.460 --> 02:33.670
Quiet, bitch.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.540
So you're stickin' to it.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.580
I'm trying to get down
to 150 pounds

02:39.580 --> 02:41.000
before my doctor's appointment.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000

(laughing)

02:46.500 --> 02:48.500
It's not funny, Elliot.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.000
I just turned 51,

02:50.000 --> 02:52.460
which is the age my mom passed
and her mom passed.

02:52.460 --> 02:56.250
I just wanna live long enough
to dance on your grave.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.500
Yolanda, you're gonna be fine.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.960
Back then, people didn't know
how to take care of themselves.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
You know, they ate too much,
they drank too much,

03:02.960 --> 03:04.000
they didn't work out.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.750
Oh my damn!
I gotta get to the gym.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.000
-Elliot, can you spot me?
-From space.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.830
Hey. I hope you're hungry.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.000
I made you a papas fritas,

03:19.000 --> 03:20.880
a meat-your-dad-loaf,

03:20.880 --> 03:22.210
and for dessert,

03:22.210 --> 03:26.120
a "father and son-day."

03:26.120 --> 03:28.960
-Gabi--
-I know that was not
a hypothetical conversation.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.380
Yolanda told me.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.330
And I know you're upset about it
because if you weren't,

03:32.330 --> 03:34.170
you wouldn't be staring
at your father's e-mail!

03:35.960 --> 03:38.330
This is a spreadsheet.

03:38.330 --> 03:41.000
Oh. Well, why aren't you
staring at it? I mean,

03:41.000 --> 03:42.670
why don't you wanna meet him?
He's your father!

03:42.670 --> 03:44.040
-Look, this is
none of your--
-Listen.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.250
You can't miss
this opportunity, okay?

03:46.250 --> 03:48.080
I would do anything
to see my mom again.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.290
Not to play the dead mom card,
that wouldn't be fair,

03:50.290 --> 03:53.120
but my mom's dead
and I can never see her again!

03:53.120 --> 03:56.040
Gabi, you wanna know why my
father's "reaching out" now?

03:56.040 --> 03:57.880
It's because my profile
in Forbes just came out.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.290
He's obviously
after my money.

03:59.290 --> 04:01.620
Ugh! Why are you
being so negative?

04:01.620 --> 04:03.880
I mean, maybe
he just wants a kidney.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.290
Come on. Aren't you even
a little bit curious?

04:07.290 --> 04:09.420
I was curious
when I was 12.

04:09.420 --> 04:11.290
I looked him up, found out
his name was Matt Danon.

04:11.290 --> 04:12.920
I even wrote him a letter,
and guess what?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.210
He never responded.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.880
Okay.
That doesn't mean anything.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.420
When I was 12,
I sent a letter

04:17.420 --> 04:19.210
to Joey from Friends
and I never heard back,

04:19.210 --> 04:22.000
not even a simple
"How you doing?"

04:23.710 --> 04:25.250
Look, Gabi,
you don't understand.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.120
Maybe he just
never got the letter.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.080
-Maybe the post office
lost the letter.
-Gabi--

04:29.080 --> 04:32.040
-God, I bet that's why
Joey never wrote back.
-Stop!

04:32.040 --> 04:33.500
I just want you to be happy.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.250
And I just want you
to stay out of it.

04:36.250 --> 04:38.120
Okay, if that's
what you really want.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.080
-That's what
I really want.
-Fine.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.790
I can't believe
we're doing this.

04:43.790 --> 04:47.000
I mean, how lucky are we
that Josh knows Matt Damon,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.620
and he sent you
to the airport
to pick him up!

04:49.620 --> 04:51.460
Uh-huh, so lucky.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.120
Um, Sofia--

04:53.120 --> 04:56.290
Oh, we almost forgot our
super cute chauffeur hats.

04:56.290 --> 04:59.040
Thank you so much
for bringing me.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.620
I wonder if Matt Damon's
happy with his wife.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.460
You gotta admit,
Sofia Maria Consuela
Rafaella Rodriguez Damon,

05:05.460 --> 05:08.080
-does have
a nice ring to it.
-Uh-huh.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.540
Are you kidding me?

05:12.210 --> 05:13.790
You spelled Matt Damon wrong.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.380
Did I?

05:18.880 --> 05:21.080
Yes. Damon has
an "M" in the middle.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.790
But Danon has
an "N" in the middle.

05:24.790 --> 05:28.210
You know,
like Matt Danon, Josh's Dad.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.580
What?

05:29.580 --> 05:31.960
You know,
Matt Damon is so over.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.210
You remember
that Martian movie?

05:33.210 --> 05:34.500
I mean, he's up there
for a whole year

05:34.500 --> 05:36.540
and doesn't see
one Martian!

05:36.540 --> 05:40.710
Gabi, are we gonna pick up
Matt Damon or Matt Danon?

05:40.710 --> 05:43.250
-Do you really not know?
-Oh my God!

05:43.250 --> 05:45.750
-Gabi, you lied to me.
-Oh, so you do know.

05:45.750 --> 05:49.290
What is wrong with you?
Josh specifically told you
to stay out of it.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.540
Yeah, I know, which is why
I told you it was Matt Damon,

05:51.540 --> 05:53.540
so you would come with me
and talk me out of it.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.040
Now? You're telling me
this now?

05:55.040 --> 05:57.960
-His dad's gonna
be here any minute.
-Yeah, I know. Talk fast!

05:57.960 --> 05:59.830
Gabi, this is so wrong,
I mean, so wrong!

05:59.830 --> 06:02.330
What if Josh is right?
What if his dad is only here
because he wants his money?

06:02.330 --> 06:04.790
Yeah, which is why I'm going
to drive him to the hotel,

06:04.790 --> 06:07.210
and get to know him
and make sure he is here
for all the right reasons.

06:07.210 --> 06:10.170
And what if he's not?
Then Josh is gonna more hurt
than he was before.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.170
Oh my God, Sofia,
you're so right.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.880
Why didn't you talk me
out of this earlier?

06:13.880 --> 06:15.330
We gotta get out of here!

06:15.330 --> 06:16.880
-I'm Matt Danon.
-Too late.

06:18.790 --> 06:22.120
-Hey, uh,
Mr. Kaminski sent us.
-Oh, how nice.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.120
Yeah, I'm Gabi,
I'm the head driver and...

06:25.120 --> 06:27.580
this is Sofia, she's my trainee.
She'll take your bags.

06:28.790 --> 06:30.210
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.120
-How are you feeling?
-A little disappointed.

06:41.210 --> 06:44.080
These hospital nachos
just ain't cutting it.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.120
She's talkin' to me, fool.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.290
You're only here
for emotional support.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.290
You chose me for that?

06:50.290 --> 06:52.880
Wow, you really are
all alone in the world.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.330
Okay, Yolanda.
You're done.

06:55.330 --> 06:57.750
(gasps) I knew it!

06:57.750 --> 06:59.210
I'm a goner!

06:59.210 --> 07:02.170
I'm comin', Mama!

07:02.170 --> 07:04.540
No, done
with the test.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.250
Actually,
you did really well.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.250
Oh!
Hold on, Mama.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.580
Your vitals are great,

07:11.580 --> 07:13.670
good blood pressure,
heart rate.

07:13.670 --> 07:15.670
In fact, you are
in tip-top shape.

07:15.670 --> 07:18.000
I think you mean
muffin-top shape.

07:19.210 --> 07:22.080
Honestly, she is
in very good health.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.000
You, on the other hand.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.920
Do you normally
sweat like that

07:25.920 --> 07:28.880
just from sitting
and eating?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.790
Do you normally have
the heat cranked up to 68?

07:44.540 --> 07:46.210
Thanks for letting me
sit up front.

07:46.210 --> 07:48.250
I get car sick.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.080
So does Josh...

07:50.080 --> 07:53.080
Mr. Kaminski, I mean.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.210
So, what brings
you to town?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.290
Well, I'm
actually here to--

07:58.290 --> 08:00.540
Reconnect with
your long-lost son?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.670
I drive Mr. Kaminski
around a lot.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.210
We've gotten close.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.710
You can kiss
that good-bye.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.250
So, uh, Mr. Danon,

08:09.250 --> 08:12.960
if I may ask, why did you
never contact Mr. Kaminski,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.250
even after he wrote to you?
Was it because you were...

08:15.250 --> 08:18.000
young and scared
and didn't know what to say?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.380
-Actually I--
-You thought, you know,

08:19.380 --> 08:21.420
you just missed
so much of his
life already

08:21.420 --> 08:23.500
that contacting him now,
it did more harm
than good?

08:23.500 --> 08:26.080
But now that you're older
and wiser, you realize

08:26.080 --> 08:30.580
nothing is more important than
meeting your son, not for money.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.170
Subtle.

08:33.170 --> 08:35.080
Believe me,
I'm very successful.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.250
This is not about money.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.790
I knew you were here
for the right reasons.

08:40.790 --> 08:41.960
(phone rings)

08:41.960 --> 08:44.420
Oh, excuse me,
I have to take this.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.170
Hello?

08:47.170 --> 08:48.420
Hey, Gaby, it's Josh.

08:48.420 --> 08:49.920
Hey!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.580
Listen, I thought about
what you said about my dad,

08:51.580 --> 08:52.710
and you're right.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.250
Yeah, I was.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.120
In fact, you won't believe
who I'm with right now.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.250
Uh, you won't believe
who I'm with right now.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.790
Thanks to you I'm
sitting right next to my dad.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.830
What?

09:04.830 --> 09:06.540
Yeah his flight got in early,
I met him at his hotel,

09:06.540 --> 09:08.040
and we're in his room right now.

09:10.290 --> 09:11.250
What?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.790
Okay, I gotta go.

09:13.790 --> 09:15.290
Okay, bye!

09:15.290 --> 09:17.620
(mutters)
Possibly forever.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.330
Gabi (thinking):
Okay, Gabi.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.920
You picked up a man
at the airport who

09:25.920 --> 09:29.960
said he was Josh's dad,
who turned out
not to be Josh's dad.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.540
There's gotta be
a simple explanation.

09:32.540 --> 09:35.170
Oh I know...
he wants to put me in a hole

09:35.170 --> 09:36.750
and make me
rub lotion on my body

09:36.750 --> 09:38.620
or else I get the hose again!

09:38.620 --> 09:40.620
All right, calm down.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.290
All I have to do is slow down,

09:42.290 --> 09:44.380
jump out and roll to safety.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.290
Oh damn it!
I can't leave Sofia.

09:47.290 --> 09:50.290
Though, really, what does
she have to live for?

09:50.290 --> 09:53.620
No boyfriend, dead-end job...

09:53.620 --> 09:55.960
Everything okay, Gabi?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.790
Everything's great.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.960
Gabi (thinking):
You freakin' psychopath!

09:59.960 --> 10:01.790
Oh, hell. I can't leave Sofia.

10:01.790 --> 10:03.040
She's the smart one.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.170
She'll know how to
get us out of this.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.790
Sofia!

10:06.790 --> 10:08.580
Sofia!

10:08.580 --> 10:10.250
What is she, deaf?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.120
Sofia, is my purse
back there?

10:14.120 --> 10:15.880
Uh...

10:15.880 --> 10:18.330
(muttering)
This guy isn't Josh's dad.

10:18.330 --> 10:21.120
-What's that?
-This guy isn't Josh's dad.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.710
-(horn honking)
-Oh God, Gabi, watch the road!

10:22.710 --> 10:25.000
Are you trying to kill us?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.120
Gabi (thinking):
I'm not, he is!

10:28.710 --> 10:30.500
Sofia, I have to get
something out of my bag.

10:30.500 --> 10:33.040
-Could you hand it
to me please?
-Yeah.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.330
Gabi (thinking):
Oh God, oh God, oh God!
What's in there?

10:35.330 --> 10:37.170
A gun? A knife?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.250
A gun that shoots knives?

10:39.250 --> 10:41.250
-No!
-Gabi!

10:41.250 --> 10:43.920
He's got a... gum!

10:45.540 --> 10:48.170
-Would you like a piece?
-Oh, no, no thank you.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.120
Clearly, I hate gum.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.210
-I'll take some.
-No, she won't!

10:53.290 --> 10:55.290
Gabi (thinking):
Yeah! That's right.

10:55.290 --> 10:57.290
Gotta wake up pretty
early in the morning

10:57.290 --> 10:59.250
to roofie Gabi Diamond.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.420
I can't believe we went to
my physical, and found out

11:08.420 --> 11:10.790
you're the one
who can die early.

11:10.790 --> 11:12.620
She didn't say die.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.080
She said,
get my affairs in order.

11:15.170 --> 11:16.620
Yolanda,

11:16.620 --> 11:18.250
your plan worked like a charm.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.120
I told Gabi I was
with my dad today,

11:20.120 --> 11:21.750
and she hasn't bugged me
once all day long.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.290
What would I do without you?

11:23.290 --> 11:24.250
(laughs)

11:24.250 --> 11:25.250
Don't worry, turns out,

11:25.250 --> 11:27.670
I'm gonna be here a long time.

11:27.670 --> 11:29.880
But you might want to
say your goodbyes to Elliot.

11:31.170 --> 11:33.120
All right, hey guys, if, uh,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.670
Gabi gets back, tell her me
and my "dad" went on a jog.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.120
Uh, what do you think
of my new gear?

11:37.120 --> 11:40.080
-Cool or douchey?
-Not douchey.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.960
(beeping sound)

11:41.960 --> 11:44.460
-What was that?
-Oh...

11:44.460 --> 11:47.290
It's this stupid health monitor
my doctor's making me wear.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.420
It beeps whenever my heart rate
or blood pressure go up.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.040
Is it anything serious?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.330
No, the doctor said I just have
to lose about five pounds.

11:54.330 --> 11:56.040
-(monitor beeps)
-Ten.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.290
-(monitor beeps)
-Fine! Thirty pounds!

11:59.290 --> 12:02.580
Oh my damn, that thing beeps
every time you tell a lie!

12:02.580 --> 12:05.460
It does?
I can't wear this.

12:05.460 --> 12:07.000
I love lying.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.290
My name's not even Elliot.

12:08.290 --> 12:09.710
It's Jung-yi!

12:12.750 --> 12:14.330
I'll take it.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.880
I can monitor
my heart rate on my jog.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.080
Okay, I'm just gonna get busy
waxing these floors.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.380
Good thing I'm not
wearing that watch.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.250
Okay, here we are
at a gas station.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.120
Wow, look, it's so crowded.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.580
So many witnesses.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.080
Uh, Sofia, let's go pee.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.750
I don't have to go.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.290
Gabi (thinking):
Damn Sofia and her
stupid giant bladder.

12:41.290 --> 12:44.880
Uh, Matt, would you mind
pumping the gas?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.080
You want me to pump it?

12:46.080 --> 12:47.920
Yeah, or is chivalry dead?

12:55.460 --> 12:57.250
That's not Josh's dad!

12:57.250 --> 12:59.380
-What?
-I've been trying
to signal you

12:59.380 --> 13:02.250
for half an hour.
He's a fake! A fraud!

13:02.250 --> 13:03.380
What are you talking about?

13:03.380 --> 13:05.540
He walked right up to us
when he saw your sign
at the airport.

13:05.540 --> 13:08.290
Yeah, what do you think
a fraud does?

13:08.290 --> 13:09.670
Anybody could claim
to be Matt!

13:09.670 --> 13:11.290
I mean, you didn't even ID him!

13:11.290 --> 13:12.580
You're the worst trainee ever!

13:12.580 --> 13:15.580
But he answered all
those questions about Josh.

13:15.580 --> 13:17.290
Who did most of the talking? Me!

13:17.290 --> 13:18.960
He just went along
with everything I said.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.250
-I don't think
that proves anything.
-Really?

13:21.250 --> 13:23.460
How about the fact that Josh
just called me from his hotel

13:23.460 --> 13:25.460
where he's sitting
with his real dad?

13:25.460 --> 13:27.420
What? Why didn't you
lead with that?

13:27.420 --> 13:29.290
We're driving around
with a psychopath.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.210
(both scream)

13:30.210 --> 13:31.960
Oh, my God.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.830
-What do I do? What do I do?
-Floor it! Floor it!

13:34.960 --> 13:38.120
-Oh, my God! (screams)
-Oh, my God!

13:38.120 --> 13:39.420
-I think I hit him.
-Uh...

13:39.420 --> 13:42.080
No it was just his foot,
you're fine! Go, go, go, go!

13:43.330 --> 13:45.250
Oh, my God, I can't look.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.540
How bad is it?

13:47.540 --> 13:49.170
Oh, it's bad.

13:49.170 --> 13:51.120
Josh's whole muffler
fell off.

13:54.170 --> 13:57.080
Um, what am I gonna tell Josh?

13:57.080 --> 13:59.120
Okay, I know, um...

13:59.120 --> 14:00.330
It was so crazy, Josh.

14:00.330 --> 14:02.500
I was down in the garage
getting something,

14:02.500 --> 14:06.120
and I noticed a tiny little mark
on your Range Rover, and so...

14:06.120 --> 14:09.040
you know, I rubbed it to see
if it was a scratch and then,

14:09.040 --> 14:10.710
you know, this just came off.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.250
Hey, what are you
doing here so late?

14:18.250 --> 14:20.080
Uh, not important.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.040
What is important, is that

14:22.040 --> 14:24.750
I am so happy that you
finally met your dad because

14:24.750 --> 14:27.290
now you understand that
having a family is...

14:27.290 --> 14:29.080
is so much more important
than having, you know,

14:29.080 --> 14:32.250
expensive cars,
or expensive stuff, like...

14:32.250 --> 14:33.830
expensive cars.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.210
Gabi...

14:36.210 --> 14:37.580
You are so right.

14:37.580 --> 14:40.250
Meeting my dad was amazing!

14:40.250 --> 14:41.500
(monitor beeps)

14:43.540 --> 14:45.210
-What's that?
-Nothing.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.380
(monitor beeps)

14:47.380 --> 14:49.120
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, why wouldn't I be okay?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.290
I had a great
afternoon with my dad.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.710
-We went for a jog.
-(monitor beeps)

14:51.710 --> 14:52.960
-Out for lunch.
-(monitor beeps)

14:52.960 --> 14:54.210
-The aquarium?
-(monitor beeps)

14:54.210 --> 14:55.620
Damn it!

14:56.960 --> 15:00.500
Gabi, there's something
I need to tell you.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.880
Remember when I told you I was
with my dad this afternoon?

15:02.880 --> 15:05.380
-Yeah.
-I wasn't.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.500
See, the thing is
I never met him,

15:08.500 --> 15:10.210
and I made
the whole thing up.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
What?

15:19.580 --> 15:21.540
I just told you that
so I could get you off my back.

15:21.540 --> 15:24.330
I didn't want to meet him
and I knew you wouldn't let up.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.250
What?

15:26.250 --> 15:29.380
And, I didn't even have
to do that because, I mean,
look at you...

15:29.380 --> 15:32.170
you totally stayed out of it
and respected my feelings.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.540
Mm-hmm, yup,
that's what I did.

15:34.540 --> 15:35.880
Um...

15:35.880 --> 15:39.750
So... hypothetically if
somebody went to the airport

15:39.750 --> 15:41.120
with a sign that said
"Matt Danon,"

15:41.120 --> 15:42.420
and then somebody
came up to them and said,

15:42.420 --> 15:43.580
"Hi, I'm Matt Danon,"

15:43.580 --> 15:45.960
odds are pretty good
it was in fact

15:45.960 --> 15:47.880
your father, Matt Danon.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.170
Gabi...

15:52.170 --> 15:53.210
what did you do?

15:54.250 --> 15:55.500
Really or hypothetically?

15:57.170 --> 15:59.000
I told you to stay out of this!

15:59.000 --> 16:01.210
Yeah, I know, but if you would
have called me with your

16:01.210 --> 16:04.960
fake father story before I got
to the airport, none of this
would have happened.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.540
So this is my fault
you went to the airport?

16:06.540 --> 16:07.710
And ran him over
with your car.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.620
What?

16:09.620 --> 16:12.750
Listen, when you called me
and said you were with
your real dad,

16:12.750 --> 16:15.000
I thought the guy
I was with was a murderer,

16:15.000 --> 16:16.540
and me and Sofia
were going to die,

16:16.540 --> 16:18.330
but it turns out
it was your real dad,

16:18.330 --> 16:20.080
and me and Sofia didn't die,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.500
and neither did he because
the hospital said he's going
to be totally fine.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.330
The hospital?

16:24.330 --> 16:26.170
Yeah, it's okay, all right?
It was just his feet.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.830
Stop! Stop! Stop talking!

16:30.210 --> 16:31.880
I told you to stay out of this,
and what did you do?

16:31.880 --> 16:33.040
I didn't stay out of it.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.290
No, you didn't stay out of it.

16:34.290 --> 16:36.080
You know why?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.960
Because you're sick.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.750
Josh, I know, I know.
I just thought it was

16:39.750 --> 16:41.460
-really important that you--
-See, see? There it is!

16:41.460 --> 16:42.750
This is it this is the sickness!

16:42.750 --> 16:44.580
You know, it doesn't matter
what you think I should do.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.000
How about what I think?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.750
You have no respect for what
I think, or for my feel--

16:47.750 --> 16:50.330
Why is there a piece of my
Range Rover on the floor?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.330
I think you already know.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.580
You know what,
Gabi, just leave.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.210
Okay, all right, that's...

17:01.210 --> 17:03.250
that's what I'll do.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.120
I'm doing it.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.210
I'm doing it.

17:10.670 --> 17:13.210
-But I just--
-Get out!

17:14.250 --> 17:16.080
I did it!

17:20.330 --> 17:23.170
Mr. Danon,
you have a visitor.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.460
I do?

17:25.460 --> 17:28.040
If it's that
crazy chauffeur girl--

17:31.330 --> 17:33.000
Josh.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.540
Don't say anything.

17:35.540 --> 17:38.120
Just listen.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.880
I only came down here
to explain to you that

17:39.880 --> 17:41.880
my chef took my car
without my permission,

17:41.880 --> 17:45.040
and she picked you up
from the airport without
my knowledge.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.210
I am extremely sorry
that she inadvertently
ran you over...

17:48.210 --> 17:49.880
twice...

17:49.880 --> 17:53.080
and I will pay
for your hospital stay,
but that's it.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.080
If you think you're getting
another dime

17:55.080 --> 17:57.460
out of her or me,
you have another thing coming,

17:57.460 --> 17:59.250
because though I am rich,

17:59.250 --> 18:02.210
I'm really, really rich,

18:02.210 --> 18:05.380
I have a team of lawyers
that will keep you tied up
in court for years.

18:05.380 --> 18:06.750
So when you get discharged,

18:06.750 --> 18:08.460
just pack up
your stuff and leave,

18:08.460 --> 18:10.500
like you did when I was born,

18:10.500 --> 18:12.460
because I don't wanna see you.

18:12.460 --> 18:13.750
I don't wanna talk to you.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.080
I don't want to hear from you,

18:15.080 --> 18:16.790
ever.

18:16.790 --> 18:20.210
-Wanna know why I never
wrote you back?
-I do, I really, really do.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.500
And he said he wanted to
write me back, but he just

18:27.500 --> 18:29.330
couldn't find the right words
to say and then,

18:29.330 --> 18:31.380
months went by
and then years went by,

18:31.380 --> 18:33.250
and he felt like
too much time passed.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.500
You know, he still said
he has my letter in his desk.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.420
Aww...

18:39.420 --> 18:41.210
So...

18:41.210 --> 18:43.460
I actually I did
the right thing by...

18:43.460 --> 18:46.170
being interested
in how you feel and...

18:47.080 --> 18:49.120
what you're thinking.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.920
Yes, thank you for
respecting my feelings.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.080
Oh well, that's just who I am.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.790
I mean, the truth is,
I have no idea where me
and my dad go from here,

18:58.790 --> 19:01.250
but I can honestly say that...

19:01.250 --> 19:02.580
I'm glad I met him.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.210
and...

19:04.210 --> 19:06.120
I'm sorry for
yelling at you earlier.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.500
So, your dad's not...

19:09.500 --> 19:11.670
mad about me running him over?

19:11.670 --> 19:13.170
Oh...

19:13.170 --> 19:14.620
No, he got over it.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.790
(monitor beeps)

19:16.790 --> 19:20.880
And you're not mad I destroyed
your super nice expensive car?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.170
Nope, I'm over it.

19:23.170 --> 19:25.250
-(monitor beeps)
-Okay.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.250
Again with that beeping.
What is that?

19:27.250 --> 19:30.920
It's a health monitor
and it seems to beep
every time you lie.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.540
No way!

19:32.540 --> 19:34.670
-Wait. So you
really are mad--
-Gabi!

19:37.290 --> 19:40.080
There is no one in my life that
could've pushed me to do this.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.620
Thank you.

19:41.620 --> 19:44.080
Well, I knew you'd
wanna meet your dad.

19:48.290 --> 19:50.040
(sighs)

19:50.040 --> 19:51.460
So we had a little fight...

19:53.710 --> 19:55.500
and a little make-up.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.420
How about a little
make-up punch?

19:58.420 --> 19:59.710
No, no, no, Josh.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.040
You know the rules, okay?
We can't have punch card sex

20:02.040 --> 20:03.170
if one of us is having...

20:03.170 --> 20:05.210
feelings, and clearly
you're having some feelings--

20:05.210 --> 20:06.830
-No I'm not!
-(monitor beeps)

20:06.830 --> 20:08.080
-I'm not!
-(monitor beeps)

20:08.080 --> 20:09.540
I'm gonna go.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.250
Yolanda,
you know I have to diet.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.540
Why did you order
an extra large pizza?

20:20.540 --> 20:22.330
You're right.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.000
I should've got
an order of wings too.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.500
(knock on door)

20:28.620 --> 20:30.710
As if watching you eat
wasn't torture enough,

20:30.710 --> 20:32.120
that's the personal trainer

20:32.120 --> 20:33.920
my doctor's making me
work out with.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.790
Aw, how about I do
a few reps with you.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.920
One.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.620
Two.

20:42.830 --> 20:44.500
Hey!

20:44.500 --> 20:45.960
Hi, I'm the new trainer, Justin.

20:47.210 --> 20:48.580
I'm looking for Elliot.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.080
Both:
I'm Elliot!

20:50.080 --> 20:52.170
Uh-uh.
Back off, bitch.

20:52.170 --> 20:53.750
Now it's my turn
to be hangry.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.000
Come on, Justin. Oh, oh yes.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.420
Damn!

21:00.420 --> 21:04.040
Why do I gotta be so healthy?

21:04.040 --> 21:05.210
(screams)
