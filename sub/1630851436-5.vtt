00:06.172 --> 00:07.974
- Mom, I don't know
about this hairstyle.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.877
- Tom, it looks so good.
I cannot ease up at this point.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.312
- I just question the blazer!

00:12.379 --> 00:14.214
I question
the blazer/side part combo.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.483
- This is class picture day.
This is a big deal.

00:16.549 --> 00:18.418
I need how you look
in these pictures

00:18.518 --> 00:20.086
to be a reflection of me.

00:21.654 --> 00:23.556
- You're holding up
the drop-off line.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.225
- I'm combing my child's hair.

00:25.325 --> 00:27.694
This is a tender moment,
a-hole.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.729
- You're making your son
look like an idiot.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.264
- Um, he looks adorable.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.333
Like a young
Timothée Chalamet, so...

00:33.400 --> 00:35.568
- Show of hands!
Who thinks this kid

00:35.668 --> 00:37.904
looks like a young
Timothée Chalamet?

00:38.004 --> 00:39.205
- Uh...

00:39.272 --> 00:41.374
- I can kind of see it.
- Thank you.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.842
We've got a consensus here.

00:42.909 --> 00:44.744
Ma, we really
gotta wrap this up.

00:44.844 --> 00:46.579
- Okay, What are you gonna do
when you get in there?

00:46.679 --> 00:48.081
- Sit up straight
and say "cheese."

00:48.181 --> 00:49.616
- I love you, buddy.
This is our life

00:49.716 --> 00:50.917
on the line here, I love you.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.585
- I think you're
expecting a lot from

00:52.685 --> 00:54.020
this hair and blazer combo.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.259
<i>- ♪ Now as our poor
young lungs deflate ♪</i>

00:59.359 --> 01:03.263
<i>♪ I'll admit

01:03.363 --> 01:09.069

01:37.730 --> 01:39.399
- Okay.
Right out of the gate,

01:39.466 --> 01:41.134
let's lose the hairdo
and the blazer.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.570
- Oh, no. My mom just spent
like a half hour on that.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.138
- Oh, did your mom ask me if--

01:45.238 --> 01:46.906
if that was time well spent?

01:46.973 --> 01:49.142
- I don't know, I'm not--
I'm not privy to that.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.343
Hey, what are you doing?

01:50.443 --> 01:51.945
- I saw your yearbook
last year.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.246
It was meh.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.981
It was meh.
- The yearbook was meh?

01:55.081 --> 01:57.283
- Look, we're doing things
a little different this year.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.651
Okay, just--
give me a silly face.

01:58.751 --> 01:59.619
Stick your tongue out.

01:59.686 --> 02:00.820
- My mom explicitly said,

02:00.920 --> 02:02.455
sit up straight
and say "cheese."

02:02.522 --> 02:05.325
- I don't do "cheese" here.
- You don't do "cheese"?

02:05.425 --> 02:07.327
That's the main word.
- Jacob!

02:07.427 --> 02:09.596
- What's happening right now?

02:09.662 --> 02:11.131
- We're trying
to capture the feeling

02:11.197 --> 02:13.266
of what it is to be a child.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.868
So give me a raspberry.
- Raspberry?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.503
- Yeah.
Give me some raspberries.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.371
- Pfft. That kind of thing?
- Y--oh! That was great.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.173
Do that again.
- Pffft. Pbbbbt.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.774
Oh, God, yeah.
Love it, okay.

02:21.841 --> 02:23.376
- Let's get--
let's get a "cheese" one.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.777
- I don't do "cheese."

02:24.844 --> 02:25.845
- You're out of control
at this point.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.046
- Turn your back to me,

02:27.147 --> 02:28.515
and throw a look
over the shoulder,

02:28.615 --> 02:30.049
like--
like peekaboo.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.151
- I'm begging you right now.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.318
We spent all weekend.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.686
We bought a comb!
- You nailed it.

02:33.786 --> 02:34.687
I think we're good.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.289
- Good!
- Jacob!

02:36.356 --> 02:37.524
I'm taking five minutes!

02:37.624 --> 02:39.359
This kid is a handful!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.698
- How's my favorite grandma?

02:45.798 --> 02:47.567
- Livin' and lovin' the world.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.902
- Can I get you a drink?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.737
- Ah, you're a doll, Tommy.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.205
I'll take a tea with honey.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.506
- A little complex.

02:53.573 --> 02:54.874
Can I get you any--
anything simpler?

02:54.974 --> 02:57.911
- Oh, okay,
just the cortado then.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.512
- Cortado?
You know what, forget I asked.

02:59.579 --> 03:00.914
Forget the beverage.
You don't seem thirsty.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.248
- What the hell?

03:02.348 --> 03:04.350
- Guess what I got?
I got the proofs

03:04.417 --> 03:06.052
for Tom's class pictures!

03:06.152 --> 03:07.253
- Oh, no.
- Oh!

03:07.353 --> 03:08.855
Let's take a look.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.390
- Are people still
looking at pictures these days?

03:10.490 --> 03:11.824
I thought that's kind of
come and gone.

03:11.891 --> 03:12.992
- I know you don't know
what it's like

03:13.059 --> 03:14.160
to be a single mom.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.495
Since your dad left,

03:15.562 --> 03:16.930
I feel like I'm judged,

03:17.030 --> 03:18.831
I feel like I gotta
keep up appearances.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.733
I need this picture to scream

03:20.833 --> 03:22.869
success, prosperity,

03:22.936 --> 03:24.737
and family values.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.507
- This is not good.
- What happened?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.776
- Did they retouch these?
What's going on right now?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.878
- Are you trying to ki--
are you trying to kill me?

03:31.945 --> 03:33.246
- It must be
the photographer's fault,

03:33.346 --> 03:34.681
he must of--
- Tom, there's no way

03:34.747 --> 03:36.049
he looked at you and said,

03:36.115 --> 03:38.251
"try to look like
a creep saying peekaboo."

03:38.351 --> 03:39.919
- He literally
said that word for word.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.354
- Tom, you need new pictures

03:41.421 --> 03:42.722
before you come back
in this house.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.524
- I think the kid
is lashing out.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.559
- Grandma, please.
- He ruined his pictures,

03:46.626 --> 03:48.261
and he refuses
to make his grandmother

03:48.361 --> 03:50.029
a simple cortado.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.899
- That is an incredibly complex
drink--you realize that, right?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.902
- It's an espresso
with a drizzle of warm milk,

03:55.969 --> 03:57.937
and it's not that hard, Tom.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.939
- Grandma, would it kill you
to run over to Starbucks?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.274
I mean, seriously.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.609
All right,
I shouldn't have said that.

04:02.709 --> 04:03.776
Now I'm lashing out.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.615
- Senator, yes!
Get up on the raft!

04:08.715 --> 04:10.083
Oh, my God, yes!

04:10.149 --> 04:12.785
- Sir, these are for
my re-election posters.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.120
- You're gonna love these,
okay?

04:14.220 --> 04:15.788
It says dignity
but not without

04:15.888 --> 04:16.956
a sense of whimsy, okay?

04:17.056 --> 04:17.957
Bounce up and down.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.325
- 'Scuse me?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.127
Hey.
I got a question

04:21.227 --> 04:22.629
about the yearbook pictures.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.230
- Are--are you for real?

04:24.297 --> 04:25.765
- Uh, my mom, uh, and grandma

04:25.832 --> 04:27.433
weren't thrilled with the--
the shots.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.302
They didn't really--
they didn't really care for

04:29.402 --> 04:31.804
the peekaboo and
the raspberries and all that.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.139
So could we just
get a quick redo?

04:33.239 --> 04:34.307
Just grab a quick "cheese" shot

04:34.407 --> 04:35.642
like we talked about?

04:35.742 --> 04:37.343
- That's so interesting.
Hey, everybody!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.078
Everybody, gather around!
- Don't make a big thing of it.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.813
- This little boy's
grandmother wasn't thrilled

04:40.913 --> 04:42.515
with my work and would like
a quick redo.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.485
And I guess my 15 years
as a professional photographer

04:45.585 --> 04:48.021
are just garbage bullshit!

04:48.121 --> 04:50.790
- My mom literally wants
a shot where I'm smiling

04:50.857 --> 04:52.125
and looking at the camera.

04:52.191 --> 04:53.593
- Your mom sounds
like a crazy bitch, okay?

04:53.660 --> 04:55.762
- What?
- I shoot for huge magazines.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.664
"New Jersey Living."
You ever heard of that?

04:57.764 --> 04:58.831
- No.
- "Hedge Fancy."

04:58.931 --> 04:59.999
You ever heard of it?
- No.

05:00.099 --> 05:01.634
- "Cat Fancy"?
- Okay.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.503
- The only reason I'm doing
grade school yearbooks

05:03.603 --> 05:05.171
is because I'm nailing
your school nurse.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.606
There.
I said it.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.875
- That's certainly
a lot to take in, uh...

05:08.975 --> 05:10.643
no redo is the recap, right?

05:10.710 --> 05:13.513
No redo?
- Show yourself out.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.383
- Tom!
- What now?

05:17.483 --> 05:19.319
- Get in my office.
Shut my door.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.720
Sit down.
Shut your mouth.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.221
- Oh, okay.
- We have a problem.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.524
Do you see what's on my wall?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.159
- Looks like
a large, framed photo

05:26.225 --> 05:27.660
of a grown man's rear end.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.629
- Exactly.
It's from the photographer.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.364
It says,
"Kiss my butt, I quit."

05:31.464 --> 05:33.900
- It seems like a odd choice
to hang it up.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.401
- He's a famous photographer.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.003
What am I gonna do?
Not hang it up?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.671
Right, now you realize
how stupid that sounds.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.173
- Yeah,
what was I thinking?

05:40.239 --> 05:41.541
- He quit 'cause of
you and your personality.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.376
And he won't hand over
the media drive.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.544
So guess what.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.012
There's not gonna
be a yearbook.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.213
- Oh, my God.
That's the best news ever.

05:47.313 --> 05:48.715
- What are you talkin' about?

05:48.815 --> 05:50.983
Tom, I want you to
tell the yearbook club--

05:51.050 --> 05:53.052
just, go ahead and
tell them it's been cancelled.

05:53.152 --> 05:55.388
- Me--you want me to tell 'em?
You're the principal.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.924
- Oh, God.
Can I be honest with you?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.860
Like, not an adult to a kid,
but just, like, as a friend?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.228
- That's a little weird,
but okay.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.063
- The yearbook club,
they scare me.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.431
Like they're the adults.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.100
And don't ever tell them that!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.901
<i>- Okay, kids.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:10.737
We need a theme
for the yearbook.

06:10.837 --> 06:11.904
Let's brainstorm.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.339
- Uh, leprechauns!

06:13.406 --> 06:14.440
- Awful, keep thinking.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.708
- Paris in the '20s?

06:15.775 --> 06:16.943
- Insipid. What else?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.344
- Uh, fracking!

06:18.411 --> 06:19.846
- That's actually good.
I like that.

06:19.912 --> 06:21.180
Thomas?

06:21.247 --> 06:22.248
- Oh, hey.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.050
Uh, listen, just a quick FYI.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.785
I know you guys
are working on the yearbook,

06:25.885 --> 06:27.420
but there's not
gonna be a yearbook.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.589
- What now?
- I asked for a redo,

06:29.689 --> 06:31.357
due to some
hair and blazer issues.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.093
- So you had
hair and blazer issues?

06:34.193 --> 06:37.230
- The photographer
got angry at me, and he quit.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.098
Not a big thing.
Don't dwell on it.

06:39.198 --> 06:43.236
- Tom, you've just
erased an entire year

06:43.302 --> 06:45.037
from everyone's lives!

06:45.104 --> 06:47.106
- That's a little dramatic.
- Without a yearbook,

06:47.206 --> 06:48.775
it's like it never happened.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.910
Bake sale?
Never happened.

06:50.977 --> 06:52.311
Band recital?
Whoo-hoo!

06:52.412 --> 06:54.213
Au revoir!
Soccer league?

06:54.280 --> 06:56.482
- Never happened!
- Thank you, Dakota.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.251
All because Tom didn't like

06:58.317 --> 07:02.388
how his insipid hair
framed his stupid face.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.724
- How are you
still teaching here?

07:05.625 --> 07:06.959
<i>- Yo, Tom, what's up?</i>

07:07.059 --> 07:08.261
Man, I heard
you screwed up the yearbook,

07:08.327 --> 07:09.662
big time!
- You know, I did.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.297
But, hey, my mom
hated the pictures anyway,

07:11.397 --> 07:13.166
so this is
a rare victory for me.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.333
- Finally.
Good to see you

07:14.434 --> 07:15.468
come out on top for once.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.003
- This is like a whole new era.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.304
Era of prosperity

07:18.404 --> 07:20.106
and good times and fun living.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.175
- Holy cow!
Look, it's Tom's face

07:22.275 --> 07:24.610
on the side of that building!

07:27.413 --> 07:29.315
- The era of prosperity
didn't last that long.

07:29.415 --> 07:30.983
- That was ten seconds
on a bus.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.186
- That's the longest run
we ever had, Tom.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.687
We gotta see
what this is about.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.422
Hey, driver!
Can we hop out here?

07:36.489 --> 07:38.157
- Yeah, of course.
Just look both ways

07:38.257 --> 07:39.959
when crossing the freeway.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.261
- All right,
we gotta find this guy.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.763
- Let's go.

07:43.830 --> 07:48.000
- We're looking for
Fedir's Ukrainian Insurance.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.168
Wait, what?

07:50.503 --> 07:52.038
"Dumb donkey-face"?

07:56.542 --> 07:58.811
What is this guy's
advertising budget?

07:58.878 --> 08:00.513
Okay, we got it.
Fedir's.

08:00.613 --> 08:01.714
This is it.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.850
What do you think?
Is this safe?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.485
- Sure,
sounds like there's

08:05.551 --> 08:07.019
a bunch of grown women
in there.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.821
- That's a good point.
If you got grown women

08:08.888 --> 08:10.690
and insurance,
you're pretty safe.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.158
- Yeah, if it was
a bunch of dudes in there,

08:12.225 --> 08:13.493
I would be terrified,

08:13.559 --> 08:15.995
but something
about it is nurturing.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.698

No, stronger, str--

Ohh.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.369
- Uh, excuse me.
Are you Fadir?

08:23.469 --> 08:24.704
- Fadir died, was poisoned.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.038
I'm son.
I didn't do it.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.673
- You didn't do it?
- Wait, Wait.

08:27.740 --> 08:29.742
Do I know you?
- Do you know me?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.244
I'm the guy
from the ad campaign.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.980
- Oh, my God!
You're donkey ass-faced kid!

08:34.046 --> 08:35.515
- No one calls me that,
but I mean--

08:35.581 --> 08:38.417
- My Verizon guy,
my Taco Bell chihuahua!

08:38.518 --> 08:40.086
- Don't get too excited, Fadir.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.821
You need to pull those ads
right now.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.389
You have no rights
to those pictures.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.391
- Ohh.
But I do.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.561
I buy photos legit
from angry photographer.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.830
- Photographer?
I can't believe he did that!

08:50.897 --> 08:52.398
Can you be a nice guy,
just pull them

08:52.498 --> 08:53.399
and, uh, give them back?

08:53.499 --> 08:55.167

08:55.234 --> 08:57.737
I love kids.
But, I am businessman.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.205
I have to feed my children.

08:59.272 --> 09:03.042
And now I see opportunity,

09:04.710 --> 09:05.745

09:08.614 --> 09:09.949
- Oh, that's
actually a really good idea.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.417
- Mind if we step outside
to get the money?

09:11.517 --> 09:12.552
- I need collateral.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.186
What if you walk out and leave?

09:14.253 --> 09:16.355
- Three-ring binder?
You want a three-ring binder?

09:16.422 --> 09:17.957
- Eh, no.
Leave, uh...

09:18.057 --> 09:19.692
Okay,
you leave other friend here.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.127
- 'Scuse me--
- Great.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.062
You hang on to Nelson,
I'll go get the money.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.600
So are you on
the insurance side

09:27.700 --> 09:29.435

the beautiful lady side?

wee-woo, woo-woo,

09:33.873 --> 09:35.207
hi-hi.

have to make small talk.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.077

09:38.144 --> 09:40.112
- Mr. B.
- This is such great news.

09:40.212 --> 09:43.382
I hopped out of the bath
when I heard your message.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.484
Here's 500 in wet singles.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.153
- Uh, one small request?
- Anything.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.088
- Please, use a normal picture
of me in the yearbook,

09:49.155 --> 09:50.423
something my mom will like.

09:50.489 --> 09:52.825
- Of course, Tom.
- Thank you.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.161
- Freeze, you bald, wet,
robe-wearing son of a bitch!

09:57.763 --> 09:58.965
- Um, Fadir?

09:59.065 --> 10:00.800
Uh, I think we need to go
check outside.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.902
- Oh, no.
If anyone is murdered,

10:02.969 --> 10:04.737
they always know.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.440
- Hey, cue ball, eyes on me!
- What's happening?

10:07.506 --> 10:09.976
- Oh, we've been staking out
this place for weeks.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.578
- Just tons of weird,
pervy behavior going on.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.813
Horses entering,

10:13.913 --> 10:15.314
but not leaving.
- Horses?

10:15.414 --> 10:16.916
- Hot women
giving insurance quotes.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.818
- Hot women?
- Large amounts of baklava

10:18.918 --> 10:19.986
being tossed in the dumpster.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.354
That's as pervy as it gets!

10:21.454 --> 10:22.989
But whatever's
going on with you two,

10:23.089 --> 10:25.157
way weirder.
- What are you intimating?

10:25.257 --> 10:27.493
- You're nude, you're bald,
you're in a robe,

10:27.593 --> 10:29.161

a hard drive labeled

10:29.261 --> 10:31.030

Man,
if you're not getting arrested,

10:32.932 --> 10:34.266
I don't know who is.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.469
- All right,
get this scumbag out of here.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.838
- Should have put a shirt on,
if nothing else.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.139
- That might have helped.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.707
Hey,
aren't you the dumb,

10:41.807 --> 10:43.342
donkey-faced kid
from those ads?

10:43.442 --> 10:44.710

real quick.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.281
No, not like that.
Make the donkey face.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.117
- Make the face?
- Yes.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.485
- How's that?
- Look dumb.

10:52.551 --> 10:54.620
- How's that?
- Dial up the donkey.

10:55.121 --> 10:56.155

10:56.222 --> 10:58.224
Tom!
- You like it?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.359

in your yearbook photo.

11:00.459 --> 11:02.328
You look like Bill Gates,
buddy.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.363

- Aren't you kind of glad

11:04.463 --> 11:06.565
I told you to sit up straight
and say "cheese"?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.734

Great picture in the yearbook,

11:08.834 --> 11:10.302

how to make a cortado.

11:10.369 --> 11:13.205

Pffft.

in front of your children.
