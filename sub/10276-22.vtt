Look, we're here.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.510
- Hi, Jin.
- Hi, Sofia.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.912
Welcome back to
Wei-Ling.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.681
I thought the Festival
of Kites starts tomorrow.

01:22.683 --> 01:26.185
It does. Everyone is just
giving their kites
a practice flight.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.521
Wow. I never knew
there could be so many
different kinds of kites.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.723
Oh, yes. Each village
in Wei-Ling

01:31.725 --> 01:33.692
brings their own
special kite for
the festival.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.862
Some are made of
silk and bamboo,
like in the olden days.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.865
But some of the new kites
are made of just about anything.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.434
Look!

01:42.436 --> 01:44.536
Oh, what's that?

01:44.538 --> 01:46.705
That is a new way
to fly kites.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.874
It's my entry
for the festival,

01:48.876 --> 01:50.609
and it's got
all the bells and whistles.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.444
See? Bells
and whistles.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.447
- ( hooting )
- That sounds like
a real owl.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.717
Father has decreed this
the year of new things.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.919
So I wanted to make
a new kite

02:00.921 --> 02:02.888
that shows off the latest
scientific thinking.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.556
It's all amazing.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.558
Jun must be so excited
for tomorrow.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.394
I can't believe she gets
to open the festival.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.965
Well, there may be
a problem with that.

02:12.967 --> 02:15.968
( sneezing )

02:15.970 --> 02:18.103
Princess Jun
has the summer
sniffles.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.739
A week in bed,
and she'll be
as good as new.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.307
That's good news.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.909
It's the worst
news ever.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.577
If I'm stuck
in bed for a week,

02:25.579 --> 02:28.580
I can't open the festival
tomorrow.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.415
Oh, right.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.484
Wu-Chang, isn't there
anything you can do?

02:32.486 --> 02:35.587
Perhaps. There is a rare
healing herb

02:35.589 --> 02:37.623
I read about
that can--

02:37.625 --> 02:39.658
Ah, Jun, good news.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.594
I have brought my advisor
on all things new.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.263
If anyone can
help you get better,

02:44.265 --> 02:46.331
it is he.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.309
Ah! Very interesting.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.644
Your Highness.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.679
Ancient legends speak of

03:00.681 --> 03:04.283
a rare flowering herb
called mendseng

03:04.285 --> 03:06.785
that will cure
the summer sniffles right away.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.453
If we could just--

03:08.455 --> 03:10.622
My friend, fear not.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.958
The Advisor
On All Things New

03:12.960 --> 03:14.459
is on the case.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.428
But thank you
for your concern.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.465
Have you a diagnosis?

03:20.467 --> 03:22.801
My analysis indicates
the princess has

03:22.803 --> 03:25.304
the Snifflus Lux Aestiva.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.306
The "summer sniffles."

03:27.308 --> 03:29.641
The data indicates
that if the princess

03:29.643 --> 03:32.044
drinks lots of fluid,
stays in bed,

03:32.046 --> 03:34.646
and wears this
sneeze-measuring head gear,

03:34.648 --> 03:36.648
it may reduce
her time in bed

03:36.650 --> 03:38.650
all the way from
seven days

03:38.652 --> 03:42.487
down to six
and a half days.

03:42.489 --> 03:44.556
I, uh... I see.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.625
Thank you.
You may go.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.663
I know your heart was set
on opening the festival, Jun,

03:51.665 --> 03:54.566
but I'm afraid I shall
have to appoint someone else.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.368
I am sorry.

03:56.370 --> 04:05.677
I understand, Father.
( sneezes )

04:05.679 --> 04:07.412
It's just
not fair, Sofia.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.681
She has been
looking forward
to this all year.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.718
Then we have to find
a cure so Jun can open
the festival tomorrow.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.087
But how? Even the Advisor
On All Things New

04:15.089 --> 04:17.356
didn't come up
with anything.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.191
So if new ideas
aren't helping Jun,

04:19.193 --> 04:21.426
maybe we need
an old idea.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.863
What are you making,
Wu-Chang?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.865
A traditional
bamboo kite.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.368
Our people have been
making kites like this

04:29.370 --> 04:31.870
for almost 2,000 years.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.706
Nice, but it could use
some bells and whistles.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.708
Well, I think
it's pretty.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.610
Thank you,
Princess Sofia.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.713
But today, people seem
to prefer the new kites

04:41.715 --> 04:44.549
with their iron gears
and flapping wings

04:44.551 --> 04:46.418
and... ( chuckles )
oh, never mind that.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.886
How may I help you?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.721
We wanted you to help
Princess Jun.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.124
I would like
nothing more.

04:52.126 --> 04:55.727
But I fear the emperor
no longer has any use
for my ancient ways.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.763
I am like the bamboo kite.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.731
I have no place here
anymore.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.234
But you said you could
cure Jun quickly

05:02.236 --> 05:03.435
using the old ways.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.904
Yes, with the mendseng herb.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.775
But unfortunately,
there is only one
place to get it.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.743
JIN: Mount Dashan?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.146
Yes. It is
a long journey.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.648
Then what are we
waiting for?
Let's go.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.819
Well, if there's a chance
it'll help Jun,

05:20.821 --> 05:22.754
I'm willing to try
anything.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.756
Even old stuff.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.658
Please, Wu-Chang.
For Princess Jun?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.593
Ah, very well.

05:28.595 --> 05:32.030
For my princess,
I will do what I can.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.935
Sorry. I had to pack
a few things we might need

05:36.937 --> 05:38.303
to get the job done.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.772
- Like what?
- All the newest gadgets.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.308
My Easy Breezy,
my Perfect Pointer,

05:43.310 --> 05:44.810
my Quintessential Quill.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.446
Oh. I just brought
water and snacks.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.181
I knew I was
forgetting something.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.949
Come along, children.

05:50.951 --> 05:54.419
Walking will get one
farther down the road
than talking.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.790
What's that?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.125
My Perfect Pointer.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.960
It tells you what
way you're going.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.628
- What way are we going?
- That way.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.465
I use the ancient method
to find which way to go.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.466
What's that?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.801
I look at the sun.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.336
What do you do
when it's cloudy?

06:11.338 --> 06:12.804
( stammers )

06:12.806 --> 06:15.173
You know, you should
really get one of these.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.042
Hmm.

06:19.846 --> 06:22.647
Wow. This wall is huge.

06:22.649 --> 06:27.552
Yes. The Dah-Tiang Wall
runs around all of
Central Wei-Ling.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.660
JIN: But where's the gate?

06:35.662 --> 06:37.396
Many miles away.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.331
So we must go
over the wall.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.832
But fear not.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.168
I know an ancient
levitation spell

06:43.170 --> 06:45.170
to get us
up the side.

06:45.172 --> 06:48.206
Be patient, young ones.
This may take some time.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.841
( chanting )

06:49.843 --> 06:52.544
How long are we
supposed to wait?

06:52.546 --> 06:53.845
I don't know.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.014
( chanting continues )

06:56.016 --> 06:57.749
Okay, that's it.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.352
We don't have all day
if we're going to help Jun.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.498
- All right, children. Ready?
- SOFIA: Come on, Wu-Chang.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.102
( groans )

07:35.054 --> 07:36.922
Wu-Chang, are you okay?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.291
Oh, I have not levitated
in years.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.626
I had forgotten the energy
it takes,

07:41.628 --> 07:43.895
especially on
a hot summer day.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.063
Would you like some water?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.232
No, thank you, princess.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.835
With my fan, I should
cool down in no time.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.905
My Easy Breezy cools you off
super fast.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.975
See? New gadgets
get the job done.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.277
Perhaps the emperor
is right

07:59.279 --> 08:01.746
to set aside old ways
like mine.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.816
Well, new ideas couldn't
cure Jun's sniffles in time,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.618
but you can.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.753
And when you do that,
the emperor will remember

08:08.755 --> 08:10.322
how important
the old ways really are.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.091
- ( loud rustling )
- Are you hearing that?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.659
What is it?

08:16.095 --> 08:19.865
Big finish.
Ta-da!!

08:21.334 --> 08:23.101
An audience.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.505
A real audience,
and they like me.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.507
Thank you so much.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.476
You must be one of
the magical talking pandas

08:31.478 --> 08:33.945
from the north forest.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.981
Greetings.
I am Wu-Chang.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.782
Hi. I'm Kai.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.819
I am Prince Jin,
and this is Princess Sofia.

08:40.821 --> 08:44.122
The Imperial Sorcerer,
the prince of Wei-Ling,

08:44.124 --> 08:46.324
and a princess?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.627
I am at your service.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.962
You are such a good dancer.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.864
Thank you.
It's so great to hear that.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.966
There's no one to
watch me dance in
the bamboo forest,

08:54.968 --> 08:56.701
and I know, like,
a billion dances.
Wanna see them?

08:56.703 --> 08:59.137
I'm so sorry, but I don't
think we have time.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.872
We have to get to
Mount Dashan

09:00.874 --> 09:02.707
and back to the palace
by sundown.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.809
Oh, okay.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.978
You're in a hurry.
Sure. I understand.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.813
I was a little lonely,
I admit,

09:08.815 --> 09:09.981
and I got
a little worked up.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.217
I'll just go dance
for myself

09:12.219 --> 09:14.052
some more then
over here.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.488
- By myself.
- Wait.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.823
No, it's okay.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.859
It was so nice to finally
dance for someone. Thank you.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.994
Farewell,
and good luck on your journey.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.196
Can't we just stay
for one dance?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.998
He's so lonely,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.667
and it would make him
so happy.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.669
We're trying to help Jun,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.671
and we're barely going to
make it back to Mount Dashan,

09:32.673 --> 09:36.007
get the mendseng,
and get back
in time as it is.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.009
Ah, but, Prince Jin,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.679
those who turn aside
to help someone in need

09:40.681 --> 09:43.048
may also be
helping themselves.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.016
Do you mean,
if we help him,

09:45.018 --> 09:46.751
he might help us, too?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.688
Exactly so.
Come.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.656
( snoring )

09:55.094 --> 09:57.028
( laughing )
You're back.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.397
This is my lucky day.
Please sit.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.266
Pull up a rock,
take a load off.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.203
This is so great.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.038
See, lizards
don't like dancing.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.873
Bamboo rats
are not friendly.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.943
So my only audience
is that sloth.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.779
But he never really
says anything.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.982
I'm not even sure
he's awake.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.419
Oh, he is. Hi.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.556
Well, Kai, we have time
for one dance,

10:24.558 --> 10:26.224
so what would you
like to show us?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.892
Right. Of course.
You're in a hurry.

10:27.894 --> 10:29.894
So let's see.
Which dance?

10:29.896 --> 10:31.296
Which dance?

10:32.965 --> 10:34.466
I know.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.403
Oh, and feel free
to get up and dance

10:38.405 --> 10:40.138
if the feeling strikes ya.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.075
♪ My family
just wanted me ♪

10:44.077 --> 10:47.612
♪ To do like
all pandas do ♪

10:47.614 --> 10:50.615
♪ Climb up into
the trees ♪

10:50.617 --> 10:54.619

Ta-da!

12:58.211 --> 13:00.278
That was great.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.113
It really was.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.215
But walking will get one
farther down the road

13:04.217 --> 13:06.551
than talking, right?
So...

13:06.553 --> 13:08.253
Hey, my dad used to
say the same thing.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.088
'Cause I talk all the time
was his point.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.422
So I won't keep you
by gabbing.

13:11.424 --> 13:14.225
But thank you so much
for being my audience.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.794
Where you going again?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.796
To get some mendseng
for a sick friend.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.798
It is found on
Mount Dashan.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.966
Oh, that's a long way off.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.735
You'll never reach it
by sundown.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.070
I knew this would happen.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.305
Don't worry.
You did me a favor.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.940
Now I'll do you one.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.308
I'll get you that mendseng
in no time.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.578
With this.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.648
- What is it?
- Why, it's bamboost.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.584
I thought it was all gone
from this part of the kingdom.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.921
Bamboost was very popular
with the ancients.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.589
Why was it so popular?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.624
It's not because
of how it tastes, I can
tell you that much.

13:46.626 --> 13:51.095
Bamboost was known for
its magical elastic properties.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.096
Like bendable?

13:52.098 --> 13:54.332
Exactly.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.835
Come on, I'll show you.
Do what I do,

13:56.837 --> 13:59.504
and I'll get you to
that mountain before
you know it.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.281
Bamboost is awesome!

14:10.283 --> 14:12.684
That was a blast!

14:12.686 --> 14:15.620
Ah. Made me feel like
a young man again.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.455
You were right,
Wu-Chang.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.324
Stopping to help Kai
did help us.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.658
We got here
so fast.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.528
But where is Kai
anyway?

14:25.698 --> 14:30.068
Big finish!
Ta-da! Ow.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.471
Thank you.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.206
That means a lot.
Thanks.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.711
- So where do we find
the mendseng?
- There.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.718
How do we get
all the way up there?

14:46.720 --> 14:48.386
Bamboost won't bounce us
that high.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.388
We? You're coming too?

14:50.390 --> 14:53.324
I told you I'd get you
to the mendseng, remember?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.660
Hey, Jin, can we use
your grappling hook

14:55.662 --> 14:57.228
to go up the cliff?

15:03.002 --> 15:05.670
I don't think
it'll reach.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.071
What are we
gonna do?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.173
Turn to the old ways,
Prince Jin.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.342
I shall use
my ancient magic

15:11.344 --> 15:13.378
to get us to the top
of the mountain.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.647
Now, everyone
on this log. Please.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.855
I move well for my size.

15:23.857 --> 15:27.258
( chanting )

15:52.785 --> 15:54.552
We are too heavy.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.387
I do not think I can
hold us.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.390
Look. There's a ledge.
Can you reach it, Kai?

15:59.392 --> 16:00.525
I think so.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.429
Climb over me.

16:16.608 --> 16:20.078
I am so sorry.
You could've been hurt.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.413
I wanted to prove
the old ways were better,

16:22.415 --> 16:25.416
but perhaps they really do
belong in the past.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.418
It's okay, Wu-Chang.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.153
My grappling hook should
reach the top from here.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.476
This is
incredible.
So much color.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.778
There is more than
enough mendseng

16:53.780 --> 16:56.614
to brew a healing tea
for Princess Jun.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.485
And that sunset
is spectacular!

17:00.487 --> 17:01.853
Sunset?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.389
Oh, no. I didn't realize
it was getting so late.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.657
We'll never get back
with the mendseng

17:06.659 --> 17:07.658
in time to help Jun.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.627
Do not feel bad,
young prince.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.630
My old ways caused problems
from the beginning,

17:12.632 --> 17:14.632
and delayed us far too much.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.001
But, Wu-Chang,
without your old ways,

17:17.003 --> 17:19.203
we would never have
become friends with Kai

17:19.205 --> 17:20.304
and found the bamboost.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.306
And without your new ways,

17:22.308 --> 17:24.475
we would still be stranded
on that ledge.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.677
I'm no expert. I mean, I'm
just a magical talking panda

17:26.679 --> 17:28.846
who happens to be
an amazing dancer.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.150
But it sounds to me like
there's a place for both ways,

17:32.152 --> 17:34.986
- is what I'm saying.
- SOFIA: Wait.
That's the answer.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.155
If we want to get back
in time to help Jun,

17:37.157 --> 17:39.490
we need old ideas
and new ideas.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.826
I'll show you.
Let's make a kite.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.895
A great big kite,
just like the one

17:43.897 --> 17:45.863
you made, Wu-Chang,
only bigger.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.665
Way bigger.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.667
Ah, I see now,
princess.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.502
Yes, that could work.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.271
But we must hurry.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.083
WU-CHANG: There. One
traditional bamboo kite,

18:05.085 --> 18:07.185
big enough
to carry us home.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.754
An old idea,
and a great one.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.689
But there isn't
enough room up here

18:11.691 --> 18:13.391
to run with the kite
and get it up in the air.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.094
That's where the new idea
comes in.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.599
Hmm.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.540
This should give us
the extra lift we need.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.211
Excellent. Come.
Let us gather the mendseng.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.080
No need. I did that
for you. Ta-da!

18:36.082 --> 18:38.049
Wow.
Thanks, Kai.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.118
No, thank you. You don't
know what it means to me

18:40.120 --> 18:41.552
to know someone
likes my dancing.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.722
We love your dances.
Why don't you come with us?

18:44.724 --> 18:47.558
It's so lonely out
in the bamboo forest
all by yourself.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.894
Thanks for the invite,
Sofia, but I think

18:49.896 --> 18:51.929
it's about time
I go back to my family.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.264
Why now?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.966
You helped me realize

18:54.968 --> 18:56.601
I need to honor
my family's old ways

18:56.603 --> 18:59.137
and make them appreciate
my new ones.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.472
The dancing. I mean,
and I miss my mom.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.808
I'm so glad,
but I'll miss you.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.576
Thanks again,
my old new friends.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.647
My path takes me
that way.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.652
- Hurry. We must be going.
- Right.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.354
Bye!

19:17.623 --> 19:19.991
Okay, everyone,
on the count of three.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.528
One, two, three!

19:25.631 --> 19:27.698
Climb on, Jin!

19:36.775 --> 19:38.342
It's working.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.957
( gasps )
What are those?

19:52.959 --> 19:56.694
Night kites.
We're almost home.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.774
Come on.
We have to hurry.

20:12.678 --> 20:17.248
( sneezing )

20:18.717 --> 20:22.486
Sofia, I want you to do
something for me.

20:22.488 --> 20:25.990
I want you to be the one
who... who...

20:25.992 --> 20:27.658
( sneezes )
Excuse me.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.827
- Jun, listen.
- No, wait.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.230
I told my father
I want you to be the one

20:32.232 --> 20:34.165
who opens the festival
tomorrow.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.534
Well, I don't think
we'll both be able to do it.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.836
But I...

20:38.838 --> 20:40.738
( sneezes )
Excuse me.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.540
But I can't.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.442
To your health,
Princess Jun.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.846
It is a healing tea,
my emperor,

20:48.848 --> 20:51.649
brewed from the rare
mendseng herb.

20:53.685 --> 20:56.187
It's worth a try,
isn't it, Your Majesty?

20:56.189 --> 20:58.222
We went through a lot
to get it, Father.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.625
Proceed.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.899
Ah... ah... ah...

21:08.901 --> 21:11.702
( relieved sigh )
I don't have to sneeze.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.804
Wu-Chang, thank you.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.775
A most excellent solution.

21:20.245 --> 21:23.547
Please accept my apology,
Wu-Chang.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.884
I believed that newer
always meant better.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.287
But from now on,
I will heed the advice

21:29.289 --> 21:31.922
of my wisest counselor.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.891
Huh?

21:33.893 --> 21:36.694
You, my old friend.
( laughing )

21:38.263 --> 21:40.531
( people cheering )

21:42.901 --> 21:45.903
Honoring the old
and celebrating the new,

21:45.905 --> 21:48.406
I hereby open
the Festival of Kites!

21:48.408 --> 21:50.474
Release the Wei-Ling dragon!

22:06.625 --> 22:08.826
( playing joyful tune )

22:12.798 --> 22:14.765
- Kai?!
- I was on my way home,

22:14.767 --> 22:17.134
but I saw all those kites
and I just had to come

22:17.136 --> 22:18.703
and check this out first.

22:20.939 --> 22:23.240
Big finish!

22:24.776 --> 22:26.010
Ta-da!
