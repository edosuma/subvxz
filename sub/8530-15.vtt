WEBVTT

00:02.041 --> 00:04.166
We need to ask Horace for a raise.

00:04.250 --> 00:07.959
I feel like I spend
half of my paycheck on tipping alone.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.959
Because you try to be a big shot.

00:10.041 --> 00:12.875
When you go to the bank,
you don't have to tip the teller.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.166
Or the ATM machine.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.583
That's your opinion.

00:19.208 --> 00:22.041
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for your opinion.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.750
Look, we can't ask for a raise.

00:26.834 --> 00:29.875
Last time we did,
Horace said the hospital was going broke

00:29.959 --> 00:32.709
and then sobbed uncontrollably
for 10 minutes.

00:33.208 --> 00:34.417
It was super creepy.

00:35.709 --> 00:36.959
Okay, how about this?

00:37.041 --> 00:39.041
If Horace doesn't give us the raise,

00:39.125 --> 00:40.500
then we'll threaten to quit.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.625
And what if he calls
our bluff and tells us to quit?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.875
He can't.

00:43.959 --> 00:45.417
Dude, we're irreplaceable.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.291
There's no one else like us here.

00:49.375 --> 00:52.125
Whoa, look at this place!

00:53.417 --> 00:55.125
Hey, there's Blue Tornado!

00:57.083 --> 00:58.625
And Solar Flare!

01:01.166 --> 01:03.458
This must be some kind
of secret superhero hospital!

01:05.041 --> 01:08.083

Um, who are you guys?

02:01.625 --> 02:04.125
Hi. I'm Gulliver and this is Chaz.

02:04.208 --> 02:06.834
Gulliver and Chaz? What dorky names.

02:08.542 --> 02:10.041
How did you two find this place?

02:10.125 --> 02:12.250
We were hanging out
at our favorite comic book shop,

02:12.333 --> 02:15.458
and I bet Chaz he couldn't bust down
a door with his head, like Gray Granite.

02:15.959 --> 02:17.208
I lost.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.417
The bet and my peripheral vision.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.000
See? Nothing.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.041
Anyway, at the hospital,
Chaz followed this guy

02:27.125 --> 02:30.250
who looked exactly like Blue Tornado
into a janitor's closet.

02:30.375 --> 02:32.959
We then solved the Caduceo
puzzle and here we are.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.208
Where are we, by the way?

02:38.083 --> 02:41.458
You're at Mighty Med,
a secret superhero hospital.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.375
So you guys are superheroes?

02:43.875 --> 02:45.667
Great alter-egos.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.375
How do you hide your muscles like that?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.166
We're not superheroes.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.291
We work here, helping superheroes.

02:52.375 --> 02:53.875
And for the record,

02:53.959 --> 02:56.250
under this shirt
I have a serious one-pack.

02:58.875 --> 03:02.125
Hey, do you think you could
get us jobs here too?

03:02.208 --> 03:05.000
I'm sorry, but you guys can't work here.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.875
You're just two comic book geeks
who stumbled in here off the street.

03:07.959 --> 03:09.709
You're completely unqualified.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.417
So were we.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.792
We know that, but they don't know that.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.291
We do now.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.625
You guys are really bad at whispering.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.333
(together) Sorry.

03:22.417 --> 03:25.792
Boys, stop badly whispering
about being sorry

03:25.875 --> 03:27.166
and get over here.

03:27.875 --> 03:31.041
Serge is crashing.
He's turning red and barely breathing.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.041
Just like in issue 351.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.750
He was exposed to the Aldebaran Crystal,
his mortal weakness.

03:35.834 --> 03:38.125
Which can only be cured by a massive...

03:38.208 --> 03:40.291
(together) Negative electrical charge.
Horace, we figured it --

03:43.625 --> 03:47.041
Outstanding work,
normos I've never seen before.

03:48.542 --> 03:51.583
Every couple of years
I like to impulsively hire

03:51.667 --> 03:54.208
someone with no experience
and grossly underpay them,

03:54.291 --> 03:55.458
so welcome aboard.

03:57.458 --> 03:58.709
Horace, are you kidding?

03:58.792 --> 04:00.458
Yeah, you can't hire them.

04:00.542 --> 04:02.417
The hospital doesn't have the money.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.917
Right. I forgot.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.792
So, Kaz, Oliver,
you'll have to take a pay cut.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.959
Good thing you're not hurting for money.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.166
Yesterday Kaz tipped me 20 bucks
just for giving him his paycheck.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.208
Horace, can I talk to you for a minute?

04:24.709 --> 04:27.125
Sorry, Skylar, my schedule is wide open.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.083
We're going to have to talk for 5 minutes.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
Well, it seems like everyone's
in a bad mood lately.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.417
I think we should do something
to boost morale.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.333
Please. I haven't seen
a single example of low morale.

04:41.417 --> 04:42.625
Really?

04:46.917 --> 04:49.917
Cro Magno sad. Morale low.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.625
All right, fine!

04:54.709 --> 04:57.291
If you have any ideas
for how to cheer people up,

04:57.667 --> 04:59.959
you're welcome to put them
in the suggestion box.

05:00.583 --> 05:01.792
It's right here,

05:01.875 --> 05:04.250
where I keep everything
I couldn't care less about.

05:09.834 --> 05:11.959
Is this the sweater
I made for your birthday?

05:14.291 --> 05:16.625
Is it?
I thought I put it in the trash.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.166
Wait.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.417
Let's put the suggestion box
up on the wall.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.917
If people feel
like their voices are being heard,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.709
it could really help morale.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.125
I'm telling you, morale isn't bad.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.333
People love it here.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.500
Like Lizard Man, playing a happy tune.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.166
Maybe that's just how the song goes.

05:53.166 --> 05:56.750
Okay, I'm just saying,
I don't like these new guys showing us up.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.375
Plus, being the only normos
at Mighty Med is our thing.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.542
It's bad enough
I have to share it with you.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.208
Kaz, let it go.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.125
Horace is probably gonna put them
on opposite shifts from us,

06:08.208 --> 06:09.750
so you'll never
have to see them again.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.375
Guys, come meet my new friends
Chaz and Gulliver.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.250
They're just like you,
only much, much better.

06:23.417 --> 06:26.000
Yes! High score! Oh, yeah!

06:26.083 --> 06:28.458
They even "oh, yeah" better than you do.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.500
But not better than me.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.125
Oh, yeah!

06:35.458 --> 06:38.542
Oliver, these guys are stealing our lives.
We have to take them down.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.458
Maybe instead of feeling threatened,

06:40.542 --> 06:43.125
you should view them
as friendly competition.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.000
Hey, there's my cute little buddy.

06:51.625 --> 06:55.208
Thank you so much for supporting
my idea of putting up the suggestion box.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.583
-Horace said yes.
-Anytime.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.834
Hey, do you want to go
on a date with me Friday?

07:00.583 --> 07:01.792
Hmm.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.625
Dating someone I work with
and see every day?

07:04.291 --> 07:05.750
That would be so...

07:05.834 --> 07:07.375
convenient.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.125
That's it. These guys are going down.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.875
What are you doing?

07:21.959 --> 07:24.625
Well, I noticed that morale has been low
in the hospital lately,

07:24.709 --> 07:27.375
so I'm putting up a suggestion box,
so people can voice their opinions.

07:27.458 --> 07:29.959
You can't put it there.
That's where I go to lean.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.583
It's my leaning spot.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.542
What if you try leaning over here?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.500
I don't like it.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.333
Besides, if you really
want to help people,

07:42.417 --> 07:44.250
you should form a riot club,

07:44.333 --> 07:47.125
where we start a riot
and the people can fight each other.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.875
Okay, I have two comments about that.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.750
First, since it's a suggestion,
it should go in the box.

07:53.834 --> 07:57.125
And second,
it's an unbelievably stupid suggestion.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.542
Hey, you think I'm going to stand here
and let you criticize me like that?

08:03.166 --> 08:04.208
I'll stand here.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.166
This is where I get criticized.

08:06.250 --> 08:07.500
It's my criticism spot.

08:13.458 --> 08:16.917
Man, I can't believe Horace
is letting Chaz and Gulliver

08:17.000 --> 08:18.291
assist in surgery,

08:18.375 --> 08:21.458
and we have to eat
all the expired DNA samples.

08:23.417 --> 08:24.625
What are you doing?

08:24.709 --> 08:27.750
Horace didn't say we have to eat them,
he just said get rid of them.

08:27.834 --> 08:31.291
Yeah, I know, but the trash can's
all the way over there.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.583
Wait. I have an idea
of how to get rid of Chaz and Gulliver.

08:36.667 --> 08:40.375
I'm on board if it involves
putting on sunglasses

08:40.458 --> 08:42.041
and walking down the hallway
in slow motion.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.959
I was going to suggest
checking their employee files

08:46.041 --> 08:48.667
and looking for some dirt on them
so we can get them fired.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.000
There's no reason we can't do both.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.709
This is taking
a lot longer than I expected.

09:14.792 --> 09:17.792
Hurry. We need to find
Dr. Wrath's ashes.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.208
Dr. Wraith, Dr. Wrangler...

09:20.291 --> 09:22.542
Here he is.
"Dr. Wrath, comma, ashes of."

09:24.291 --> 09:26.959
Don't worry, Dr. Wrath,
soon you will be resurrected.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.500
And then we will exact
our revenge on Kaz and Oliver

09:29.583 --> 09:30.625
for what they did to you.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.083
-(squeaks)
-Hey!

09:38.500 --> 09:40.208
Okay, don't worry, I got this.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.792
Tell you what.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.250
Why don't you just forget
that we were ever here?

09:48.458 --> 09:49.583
Oh!

09:54.750 --> 09:56.291
I can't believe you guys are evil,

09:56.375 --> 10:00.750
although it does make me feel better
about hating you guys for no good reason.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.125
You think we're evil now?

10:03.208 --> 10:05.500
Wait until we bring
our favorite professor back to life.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.458
-Professor?
-That's right.

10:07.542 --> 10:08.875
We go to Villain University,

10:08.959 --> 10:10.917
the world's best college
for super criminals.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.959
We destroyed Villain State this year.

10:14.625 --> 10:17.041
Literally. We blew it up
with a bunch of missiles.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.083
Villain University?

10:21.166 --> 10:24.500
Do you guys learn powers there?
And if so, do they offer an online course?

10:26.667 --> 10:28.583
Dr. Wrath taught us everything we know.

10:28.667 --> 10:32.583
I learned to take any hero's power
and reflect it back at them.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.709
And I learned to create mirages.
Like this.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.917
That was really mean.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.375
You guys are wasting your time.

10:51.458 --> 10:54.500
The only one
who can bring Dr. Wrath back to life

10:54.583 --> 10:56.792
is Caduceo, and nobody knows who that is.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.333
It's Horace Diaz.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.375
What? How did you know that?

11:03.041 --> 11:05.750
I mean, Horace Diaz?

11:05.834 --> 11:07.667
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.333
Wow, you're as bad at lying
as you are at whispering.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.792
Yeah, you need to take Intro
to Lying and Whispering at Villain U.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.458
(whispering) I got an A-plus.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.750
-I can't hear you.
-(whispering) Exactly.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.792
Anyway, before Dr. Wrath died,

11:25.875 --> 11:28.834
he told the entire villain world
that Horace is Caduceo.

11:28.917 --> 11:32.083
And we're going to trick Horace
into using his powers on those ashes.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.208
All right, well, clearly
Dr. Wrath didn't teach you

11:35.291 --> 11:36.709
that in comic books,

11:36.792 --> 11:39.583
explaining your whole plan
always ends badly.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.250
Oh, it'll end badly for you,

11:42.333 --> 11:47.000
because we're going to eliminate you
in the most ironic way possible.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.041
How is this ironic?
I'm not laughing at all.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.959
What do you think ironic means?

11:56.041 --> 11:58.667
I don't know, ticklish?

12:00.208 --> 12:01.834
It means that in 10 minutes,

12:01.917 --> 12:04.458
you'll be a couple of cardboard standees,

12:04.542 --> 12:07.625
and your favorite hangout
will become your tomb.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.375
I can't move.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.000
We're turning two-dimensional.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.959
(laughs)

12:16.041 --> 12:18.959
Wait. Remember
what Dr. Wrath taught us:

12:19.041 --> 12:21.250
always stay to make sure
the hero doesn't escape.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.166
(both) I'm bored.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.917
As if this wasn't bad enough,
I think my fly is open.

12:47.542 --> 12:48.667
Thank you all for coming,

12:48.750 --> 12:51.458
and for filling the suggestion box
with all your great ideas.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.417
We are not having a riot club.

12:56.959 --> 12:59.333
Now let's see what you all had to say.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.083
"Cro Magno, it's the 21st century,
nobody uses a pager anymore."

13:06.166 --> 13:07.667
(beeping)

13:07.750 --> 13:09.625
Oh, snap!

13:10.208 --> 13:11.959
(growls)

13:12.041 --> 13:16.208
It's okay, Cro Magno.
Um, I love your pager.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.667
You can use it as a hair clip.

13:21.709 --> 13:22.959
Okay.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.959
Okay, next suggestion.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.083
"Mesmera, not to sound catty,
but wear less eye shadow.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.917
You look like a floozy."

13:42.709 --> 13:43.917
(hisses)

13:44.000 --> 13:45.625
It's okay, it's okay.

13:45.709 --> 13:46.792
Mesmera,

13:46.875 --> 13:49.291
I think what Alley Cat is trying to say

13:49.375 --> 13:52.417
is that you should go
for a more natural look.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.542
Natural look?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.625
The freak's got an eye in her hand.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.667
I have a suggestion.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.375
We should stop reading suggestions.

14:04.458 --> 14:07.333
No, this is fun. Let's do another one.

14:09.875 --> 14:13.250
"Maybe Alan could do a better job
of keeping his temper in check."

14:13.333 --> 14:14.458
Huh, yeah.

14:18.250 --> 14:22.667
What?!

14:32.875 --> 14:36.750
(grunting)

14:36.834 --> 14:39.834
(roars)

14:39.917 --> 14:44.458
(grunting)

14:45.667 --> 14:47.709
Huh? Fire bad!

15:00.458 --> 15:02.166
They closed the shop?

15:02.250 --> 15:04.333
Wow, that nap really got away from me.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.834
Gus. Help.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.667
Kaz? Oliver?

15:18.542 --> 15:21.041
What's going on?
Am I still dreaming?

15:21.834 --> 15:23.375
Uh, yes.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.667
Yes, you're having a lucid dream.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.667
And you can do anything you want in it.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.667
And you know what would make
this dream even cooler?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.333
If you rescued us.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.250
Oh, that would be cool.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.709
But first, I've always wanted
to make one of you talk like a robot,

15:36.792 --> 15:39.125
and one of you
talk like my Uncle Steve.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.542
(robot voice) Hello, Gus.
How are you today?

15:45.750 --> 15:48.959
That's amazing.
You sound just like my Uncle Steve.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.709
Oliver, you do a robot.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.709
(robot voice) Gus, now pick us up

15:56.792 --> 15:59.333
and take us exactly
where we tell you to go.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.917
Okay, but that sounds
nothing like a robot.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.625
But it does sound exactly
like my Aunt Rebecca.

16:18.417 --> 16:21.041
What is going on here?

16:21.125 --> 16:23.625
I suggest you all stop this right now!

16:28.417 --> 16:29.959
Horace, I can explain.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.333
Actually, Uncle Horace,

16:32.208 --> 16:33.458
this is all my fault.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.417
What did you do, Alan?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.792
Well, it's not what I did,
it's what I didn't do.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.875
I didn't try harder to stop Skylar
from putting up the suggestion box,

16:42.959 --> 16:45.166
which she used
to stir people into a frenzy,

16:45.250 --> 16:48.208
as if this were some sort of riot club.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.166
You did that. That was your idea.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.625
Yeah, like I have ideas.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.917
Shame on you, Skylar,
starting a riot club.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.792
That's it. You know what?

17:02.875 --> 17:05.375
I am done trying to help people.

17:11.667 --> 17:12.959
(exhales loudly)

17:14.417 --> 17:16.000
Evil box gone.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.959
Morale good!

17:18.041 --> 17:19.583
(cheering)

17:21.500 --> 17:22.834
I was right.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.417
A suggestion box does improve morale...

17:26.000 --> 17:27.667
when you destroy it.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.250
Wow, you were right.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.583
My dream has gotten even cooler.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.333
Check this out.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.083
That's the biggest M I've ever seen.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.458
Gus. Quick.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.750
Use the silver device on the cart.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.542
Thank you, Gus. You saved our lives.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.917
Ah-ah-ah. Uncle Steve voice.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.000
(robot voice) Thank you, Gus.

18:20.083 --> 18:25.125
Now go back to The Domain
and wake up from this dream.

18:25.709 --> 18:27.250
Beep-boop-bop.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.542
We need to find Chaz and Gulliver

18:31.625 --> 18:34.083
before they trick Horace
into resurrecting Dr. Wrath.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.792
-What are you doing?
-That's an M?

18:38.875 --> 18:41.041
I have never noticed that before.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.250
Hmm.
He doesn't look dead enough.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.959
Horace might try to check his pulse

18:55.041 --> 18:56.792
and realize he's a mirage.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.500
Oh!

19:01.041 --> 19:02.291
There. That's much better.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.917
I got your text. What's the emergency?

19:07.375 --> 19:08.417
(gasps)

19:10.291 --> 19:13.125
Gulliver and I found Alan on the floor!
He's not breathing!

19:13.208 --> 19:15.083
And he has an axe in his back!

19:16.125 --> 19:17.834
Who would have done such a thing?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.917
I mean, besides Axehand,
who not only hates Alan,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.542
but has an axe for a hand.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.000
This is terrible!

19:24.083 --> 19:27.000
Well, can't you do something?
Maybe call Caduceo?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.583
I don't need to call him.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.500
I am him.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.041
Thanatoi bios--

19:37.125 --> 19:38.667
Horace, don't!

19:39.208 --> 19:40.166
That's not Alan.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.583
What are you talking about?

19:41.667 --> 19:43.083
It's Dr. Wrath's ashes.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.375
Look.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.417
Freeze, new boys.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.458
(grunts)

19:50.542 --> 19:52.333
He reflected my power!

19:52.417 --> 19:54.500
My freezing hand is frozen!

19:55.500 --> 19:57.333
I am so good at irony.

19:59.375 --> 20:00.875
And now...

20:14.083 --> 20:16.125
Gamma Girl, Gearhand...

20:16.208 --> 20:18.291
Ah! Glove comma magnetic!

20:22.625 --> 20:23.959
Kaz!

20:35.834 --> 20:37.417
Man, this does take forever.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.458
No wonder you guys didn't
stay for the whole thing.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.083
Boys, thank you.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.917
I almost wasted
my last Caduceo power on Dr. Wrath.

20:57.417 --> 21:00.083
Even using it on Alan,
I was kind of like, "Eh, should I?"

21:02.250 --> 21:04.208
Well, if you really want to thank us,

21:04.291 --> 21:06.125
I think I know how you can:

21:06.625 --> 21:08.083
by giving us a raise.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.500
Oh, Kaz. I wish I could. I really do.

21:12.583 --> 21:16.083
But with the hospital facing
such financial hardship,

21:16.166 --> 21:19.500
I just can't pay you
what you rightfully deserve.

21:19.583 --> 21:22.250
It's so unfair.

21:22.333 --> 21:25.625
( crying )

21:26.250 --> 21:28.083
Told you it would get creepy.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.125
(blows nose)

21:30.208 --> 21:31.417
Ugh.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.959
(theme music playing)
