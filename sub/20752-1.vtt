Oh.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.059
I'm not getting
the height I need.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.474
I have chok in the
kitchen for breakfast.

01:04.498 --> 01:05.928
And it's time for school.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.069
Julie doesn't have
to go to school today.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.366
- None of my friends do.
- You're not Julie. You're Ivy.

01:10.438 --> 01:11.968
And Ivy's going
to Chinese school

01:12.039 --> 01:14.339
like last Saturday and the
Saturday before that.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.878
What if I skip it and promise

01:15.943 --> 01:18.313
to help Gung Gung and Po Po
at the restaurant later?

01:18.379 --> 01:20.079
All their customers
speak Chinese.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.378
I'd learn a lot of it.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.949
Like learning how
to order plum sauce?

01:24.017 --> 01:25.387
Off the tape.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.653
Beam.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.960
Come right home
after school today.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.462
We have to clean the whole house

01:30.524 --> 01:32.464
from top to bottom
before Chinese New Year.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.637
How many people
are coming again?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.731
We invited everyone
in the family.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.426
Is everyone staying here?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.998
I hope Cousin Jerry likes
sleeping in the bathtub.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.597
Some are staying at hotels,

01:41.669 --> 01:43.213
some are staying
with your grandparents.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.407
Get a little excited, Ivy.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.043
We've never celebrated
Chinese New Year

01:47.107 --> 01:48.837
with the whole family before.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.290
Mom.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.658
What do I do?

02:01.722 --> 02:03.422
Oh. I'll sew it up.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.431
But you'll fix it before the
all-city gymnastics meet, right?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.434
This is our approved
competition uniform.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.696
It has to be fixed by then.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.833
I'll get it all done, I promise.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.400
Here.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.337
Not all children get
to go to Chinese school.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.907
- You're lucky.
- Lucky?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.184
Mom, trust me.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.013
You're the only person
in San Francisco

02:24.077 --> 02:25.247
who feels that way.

Andrew, class is over.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.716
Said to be fluent,

03:34.782 --> 03:37.082
we should practice
speaking all the time.

Julie, you're back!

She comes back every weekend.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.760
So what do you want to do today?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.199
Clean the house.
Mom and Dad said so.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.625
Start without me, and if
I'm not there in ten minutes,

03:53.701 --> 03:54.771
just keep going.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.935
You know, in China,

03:56.003 --> 03:57.514
the eldest son doesn't
have to lift a finger.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.108
Cool. You should go
there right now.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.383
Donations for your plane ticket.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.548
Oh, there's even one

04:06.614 --> 04:08.684
of the new
Bicentennial quarters.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.919
- Lucky Andrew.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:10.984 --> 04:12.224
That was hilarious.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.386
Well, this is
a collector's item,

04:14.455 --> 04:15.815
so the joke's on you.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.829
Ooh. Is this new?
I like it.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.364
Mom designed them
exclusively for her store.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.031
She says every successful shop

04:25.098 --> 04:28.338
must have a signature item
to get people in the door.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.912
Mom's store has become
the talk of Haight Asbury.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.412
I'm definitely buying one

04:33.474 --> 04:35.144
with my new Chinese
New Year's money.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.808
Oh. I almost forgot.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.307
We got our official invite
to the... drum roll, please...

04:40.381 --> 04:41.951
Ling New Year's Eve dinner.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.115
And?

04:43.183 --> 04:45.053
The Albrights
will be attending...

04:45.118 --> 04:47.048
Mother, Tracy, and myself.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.420
Thanks!

04:48.489 --> 04:50.659
Thanks for inviting us.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.594
We haven't done anything
as a family in a while.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.295
So today, Washington Square Park

04:57.365 --> 04:58.695
or listen to records in my room?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.073
I got to clean the house.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.644
Oh. Uh, I'll help.
It'll be fun.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.274
Another airline pilot got sick.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.940

05:10.177 --> 05:11.477
Groovy.
Let's go.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.949
Hi, Mrs. L. Hi, Mr. L.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.021
Hi, Julie.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.319
Oh! Hi, Missy.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.691
Welcome to the Ling
spring cleaning

05:25.759 --> 05:26.689
in January.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.400
How are you? How's Tracy?

05:28.462 --> 05:30.062
Uh, we're both fine, I guess.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.430
Everyone's just getting used

05:31.499 --> 05:33.169
to the divorce and everything.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.003
It's weird living in two houses.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.508
Adjusting to change
always takes time huh?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.311

Let's go to my room.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.479
Uhh!

05:53.954 --> 05:58.034
So the superstition is that
dust is considered bad luck?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.291
That's why you get rid of it?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.759
Yeah.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.028
I think so.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.495
I have no idea.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.704
My grandma always says

06:04.765 --> 06:06.595
we have to sweep out
the old bad luck

06:06.667 --> 06:08.645
and bring in the new good
luck for the coming year.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.269
Out with the old,
in with the new.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.638
I like that.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.936
Are you changing your
hair this year, too?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.549
Out with the old.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.111
That includes hair.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.249
You're lucky. Your mom
lets you grow your hair out

06:22.315 --> 06:23.615
like Marcia Brady's.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.124
I liked your short hair
last year.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.856
You looked like Nancy Drew.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.762
I look nothing like Nancy Drew.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.034
Come on. We'll find you
a groovy new hair style.

Is it new?

07:04.692 --> 07:07.502
I love it.
We got them last week.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.361
It took three bake sales
and a car wash

07:09.429 --> 07:10.959
to pay for them.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.471
I meant the dress.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.303
Oh. Mom bought that
for New Year's dinner.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.768
Hey, you're coming to the
all-city gymnastics meet, right?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.539
Whoo-hoo!

07:20.608 --> 07:22.238
That's me practicing my cheer

07:22.309 --> 07:23.979
when you and the
tumblers win it all.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.684
- When is it?
- The 30th. 6:00.

Yeah.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.602
Ah, I hate this holiday.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.698
The date changes every year.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.570
Sometimes it's in January,
sometimes February.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.240
You know, regular New Year's
is always January 1.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.909
What am I going to do?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.748
Maybe if you explain it
to your parents...

07:59.813 --> 08:01.353
They won't understand.

08:01.414 --> 08:02.759
We've never celebrated
Chinese New Year's

08:02.783 --> 08:04.823

I don't hear much sweeping.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.564
Julie, you staying for dinner?

08:13.627 --> 08:16.557
It's going to be
rice or noodles again.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.130
It's still better
than PB&J by myself.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.544
When are you going
to tell your mom

08:22.603 --> 08:24.103

feet pointed all the way

Good. Cathy,

08:47.527 --> 08:48.557
faster on that turnover.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.699
- Yeah.
- Better.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.936
You okay?

09:01.008 --> 09:01.908
Good as gold.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.295
If this was a fall
in competition,

09:03.343 --> 09:05.088
you'd have missed your
10-count to get back up.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.922
Back to basics.
Handstand kick-down.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.821
- Basics?
- You're hesitating up there.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.383
I don't want to risk an injury.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.551
When you're ready,

09:12.620 --> 09:14.720
you can move up to low beam.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.658
That fall you took
at our last meet

09:16.724 --> 09:17.934
was a hard one.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.891
Sometimes two steps back
is a step forward.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.887
Ivy.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.324
Not bad today, tumblers,

09:49.389 --> 09:51.189
but all-city is in two weeks.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.358
We still have work to do.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.885
But I know we can get there.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.601
This is our year to win.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.133
See everyone tomorrow.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.478
What's that thing?

10:16.549 --> 10:17.819
Nothing.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.145
Boy, coaches really,
really worked us today.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.820
Yeah, but it's all-city.
We want to win.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.620
Of course. I know that.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.632
Missy: Ivy!

10:31.665 --> 10:33.565
Mom, did you bring
a towel or water?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.843
Ivy, I went from school
to the store

10:36.904 --> 10:39.144
to the law library
to picking up Missy, then...

10:41.709 --> 10:43.679
I forgot to pack your bag.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.954
I'm sorry, Ivy.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.013
It's fine.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.577
One more thing, tumblers.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.519
Since all-city is right
around the corner,

10:51.584 --> 10:52.824
I'm reserving the Youth Center

10:52.886 --> 10:56.356
for additional mandatory
practice on Saturdays.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.763
Gloria, hi.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.185
Hey, Marilyn.
How's it going?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.029
Long time, no see.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.533
It's going well, thank you.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.604
Any chance you can move
this new practice to Sundays?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.495
- Mom.
- The boys' team

11:07.567 --> 11:09.567
has this space on Sundays.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.066
- Is there a problem?
- No.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.979
Ivy has Chinese school
on Saturdays.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.882
Girl, whispering:
What's Chinese school?

11:16.944 --> 11:18.714
Mom, seriously.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.847
Okay, well, uh,

11:20.914 --> 11:22.091
we'll just have to work harder

11:22.115 --> 11:23.445
on the days when you are here.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.894
Thanks.

11:28.421 --> 11:29.991
, Ivy.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.027
Mom, shh.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.162
Sorry.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.226
Let's go home.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.662
I got it.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.301
Hold on a sec.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.165
Okay. I can talk now.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.167
What's up?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.568

12:06.559 --> 12:07.929
It's not a big deal.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.995
- Julie.
- ♪ I-yi-yi-yi... ♪

12:10.063 --> 12:12.803
My dad's coming to your
New Year's dinner, too.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.496
It's not my dinner.
It's my parents'.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.543
Why did they invite your dad?

12:18.605 --> 12:19.635
I guess they thought

12:19.706 --> 12:21.006
it would be rude to exclude him,

12:21.074 --> 12:23.084
since they were all friends
before the divorce.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.583
My mom's actually okay with it.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.405
You don't sound okay with it.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.720
Remember the last time
my whole family was together?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.394
Christmas?

12:32.452 --> 12:33.922
My sister yelled at my dad

12:33.987 --> 12:35.187
and blamed him for the divorce

12:35.255 --> 12:37.715
and stormed
out of the Fairmont Hotel.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.891
They haven't spoken since?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.230
Dad says he's
giving Tracy her space.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.095
That seems like a good idea.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.074
Yeah, but meanwhile,

12:46.133 --> 12:47.843
she's barely talking to me.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.901
What did you do?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.870
She thinks I'm betraying her

12:51.939 --> 12:53.439
by coming to Dad's
on the weekends,

12:53.506 --> 12:57.106
like I'm just supposed
to stop visiting Dad?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.847
That's not fair to him.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.282
I'm sorry, Julie.

13:00.347 --> 13:04.817
I just want us to learn
how to be a family again.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.615
Maybe your dad coming
to dinner is a good thing.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.557
Maybe they'll talk there.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.133
Yeah.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.560
I didn't think about that.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.797
Maybe if I get them

13:15.863 --> 13:17.133
to break the ice at the dinner,

13:17.197 --> 13:18.667
they'll move past
their differences.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.971
Out with the old.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.901
Got to go. Dinnertime.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.341
Bye, Julie.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.405
Thanks, Ivy.

13:26.439 --> 13:27.909
- ♪ Have a ball ♪
- Bye.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.305

13:30.377 --> 13:31.607
Marilyn: Ivy, Andrew!

13:31.678 --> 13:34.078
Chinese food again?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.917
Do we have to eat takeout

13:35.983 --> 13:37.783
from the Happy Jade every night?

13:37.851 --> 13:38.951
Ivy.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.219
I mean, it's fine.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.007
But I walk past ten
pizza parlors every day.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.155
Marilyn, we're heading
back to the restaurant.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.425
Do you want us to pick Missy
up tomorrow after school?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.055
Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.830
I don't know what we'd
do without you.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.129
Probably starve.
Thank you.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.171
Bye, Po Po. Bye, Gung Gung.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.636
Thank you
for the delicious food.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.909
Way to go.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.579
I didn't know they were there.

14:08.648 --> 14:09.758
You'll apologize to them later.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.582
Here. Eat your gai lan.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.651
Here.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.661
My uncle called today.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.026
He got time off work.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.734
The whole family
will be flying in

14:22.795 --> 14:23.995
Chinese New Year morning.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.274
That's everyone, then.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.702
I can't remember the last time

14:26.766 --> 14:28.036
the whole family was together.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.541
Not since our wedding.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.002
Andrew,
how's your kung-fu?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.471
Learning a lot?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.077
Marilyn: There's
still so much to do.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.213
I'll plan the menu this week.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.608
Now, Ivy,

14:39.679 --> 14:41.849
we'll probably have Chinese food

14:41.915 --> 14:43.175
for Chinese New Year's dinner.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.220
Try not to insult
our grandparents over it.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.585
- Very funny, Andrew.
- Ha ha ha.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.124
Ling: I'll get back to you.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.289
That was the Bay Street
Youth Center.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.788
They wanted to know
how many tickets we'd need

14:53.860 --> 14:56.430
for Ivy's all-city
gymnastics meet.

14:56.496 --> 15:00.666
Reminded me that it starts
at 6:00 on the 30th.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.643
I was going to tell you.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.983
You let Andrew miss
Ana Yee's wedding

15:09.042 --> 15:10.512
because he had
a kung fu tournament.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.107
There weren't people flying
in from all over the States

15:13.180 --> 15:14.750
for Ana Yee's wedding.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.384
The groom didn't even
want to go.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.349
Andrew.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.588
So I'm going to miss the meet?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.664
Your dad and I will
talk about this later.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.764
She should have told us.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.129
She knew we wouldn't
have let her go.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.369
Of course she can't go.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.844
Everyone has rearranged
their schedules to get here.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.674
People took time off,

15:39.739 --> 15:41.339
bought plane tickets.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.738
I know.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.309
And it doesn't look good

15:44.377 --> 15:47.177
if our eldest daughter couldn't
be bothered to show up.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.281
She's coming to the dinner.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.657
Ivy just doesn't realize
how important a family is.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.960
I mean, law school
would be impossible

16:00.027 --> 16:01.587
if my parents weren't
helping us out

16:01.661 --> 16:02.961
every single day.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.198
We tell her over and over again

16:07.267 --> 16:09.037
how important family is.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.573
Seems like it's in one ear,

16:11.638 --> 16:12.908
out the other with her.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.842
But if we make her
miss the meet, though,

16:14.907 --> 16:16.277
she'll.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.153
I can definitely see her sulking

16:18.211 --> 16:19.781
through the eight courses.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.446
If we force this
down her throat,

16:21.514 --> 16:24.124
she might end up resenting
the entire family.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.624
You're right.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.557
But we can't just
let her skip out

16:28.621 --> 16:29.891
on Chinese New Year's.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.426
I want her at the dinner,
too. I just...

16:34.127 --> 16:37.097
I just want her
to want to be there.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.441
We've talked it over,

16:42.502 --> 16:46.172
and we're going
to let you decide.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.539
You're letting me decide?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.438
We both think
you're mature enough

16:50.510 --> 16:53.010
to make the right decision.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.480
For the family.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.059
I need to think about it.

17:08.627 --> 17:09.728
Nice.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.032
Hold your core.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.608
Let's see the walkover, Ivy.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.647
Kick harder. Push out
of both shoulders.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.877
Yeah.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.121
Coach Gloria?

17:34.421 --> 17:36.391
Is there practice tomorrow?

17:36.456 --> 17:39.256
Of course. It's the last
Saturday before all-city.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.293
But don't sweat it.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.761
I know you have
family obligations.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.297
See you, Mom. Don't want
to be late for Chinese school.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.468
Let's go, Andrew.

18:08.855 --> 18:09.855
Ivy?

18:09.922 --> 18:11.992
I'll meet you at school.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.328
Ivy.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.463
Don't tell Mom.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.598
Oh, I'm so doing
the opposite of that.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.204
Come on, Andrew.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.526
What if you had a big
kung fu tournament?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.941
Wouldn't you want
to practice and practice

18:24.003 --> 18:25.414
until you were,
I don't know, perfect?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.338
Wouldn't you want to win?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.107
Or would you give it up
before you even tried?

18:31.378 --> 18:33.208
Don't drag me into this.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.496
Good job today, tumblers.
See you Monday.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.735
Go, Ivy, go. Whoo-hoo!

18:55.802 --> 18:57.042
I like that cheer.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.373
I'll be yelling it
at all-city,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.268
uh, if you decide to go.

19:00.340 --> 19:03.940
Oh. I guess you wouldn't be
coming to our family dinner

19:04.010 --> 19:05.550
if I'm not going.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.452
What about your plans
for Tracy and your dad?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.045
Maybe I can time it
so Tracy takes out the trash

19:11.117 --> 19:13.087
next time Dad comes
to pick me up.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.692
I don't know.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.024
Oh.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.688
Hey, no big deal.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.587
I'm talking spilled milk
on a white carpet small.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.790
As far as I know,

19:21.861 --> 19:23.731
they'll see each other
and argue again.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.504
It is a good feeling
to know that we're friends.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.910
And you know I like you
just the way you are.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.313
I'll be back tomorrow.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.175
Marilyn:
How was Chinese school?

19:39.045 --> 19:40.105
Hi, Mom.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.922
Ha ha! You're in trouble.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.824
Thanks, Andrew.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.456
Mrs. Lu called.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.061
She wanted to know if you knew

19:50.122 --> 19:51.662
what the homework
assignment was.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.359
Tomorrow you'll
help your grandparents

19:54.427 --> 19:55.697
clean the restaurant.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.638
Mom, I'm sorry I lied.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.273
But gymnastics
is important to me.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.439
And it's all-city.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.978
Sounds like you've
made a decision.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.423
I'll go back to Chinese
school next weekend.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.153
Ivy.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.661
What if the tumblers
win all-city?

20:23.723 --> 20:27.033
Then we compete in regionals.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.263
That's a big deal, right?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.628
- I know.
- So, more than likely,

20:30.697 --> 20:33.297
there'll be more of these
extra Saturday practices, too.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.144
You know the Woo
family next door?

20:37.203 --> 20:41.443
Their children don't speak
any Mandarin or Cantonese.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.386
Their whole family tries
so badly to be American,

20:43.410 --> 20:45.710
they forget
that they're Chinese.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.046
Our culture

20:48.114 --> 20:50.454
is important in this family.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.751
I'll go back to Chinese
school next weekend.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.027
Julie Albright's room.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.364
Julie Albright speaking.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.900
- Aah!
- Uh-oh.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.974
She doesn't understand anything.

21:07.033 --> 21:10.543
Why do I have to learn
a language I'll never use?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.273
You're not wasting
your Saturdays

21:12.339 --> 21:14.869
at German-Dutch-Irish school.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.481
Actually, my family
is also 1/13 Hungarian.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.275
Not important.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.317
I'm sorry, Ivy.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.722
It's like I keep
trying to tell everyone

21:24.784 --> 21:26.754
how important
gymnastics is to me.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.519
It's more than important.
It's... It's...

21:29.589 --> 21:31.189
It's your signature item.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.557
Exactly.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.425
W-What does that mean?

21:34.494 --> 21:35.934
Gymnastics is the one thing

21:35.995 --> 21:37.155
that you specialize in

21:37.229 --> 21:38.529
to attract people to your store.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.228
Andrew gets the good grades.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.499
Missy gets all
the cute baby attention.

21:42.569 --> 21:45.609
Gymnastics is the one
thing that defines you.

21:45.672 --> 21:46.672
Exactly.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.190
Ivy?

21:59.251 --> 22:00.521
Where's your sewing kit?

22:06.192 --> 22:08.332
I'll do my homework later.

22:08.395 --> 22:09.925
Now, please.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.048
Ow.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.956
You're up late.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.157
Are you hungry?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.698
And tired.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.934
Is this your last final?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.270
Mm-hmm.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.665
And then I promise
it'll be less crazy.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.638
I said that last semester,
too, didn't I?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.637
Is this the New Year's menu?

22:56.709 --> 22:57.839
Mm-hmm.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.752
Oh.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.646
Do we really need
three of every dish?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.019
We're not feeding
all of China Town.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.688
I skipped the roast pig
for our wedding banquet,

23:11.758 --> 23:14.428
and Yuwahi never
lets me forget it.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.064
We're sticking to this menu.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.599
It's not that much food.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.125
I mean, the whole family
is coming.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.795
Well, maybe minus Ivy.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.871
So she decided to
go to the meet?

23:26.939 --> 23:29.809
She skipped
Chinese school today.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.876
I heard.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.205
Andrew.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.980
That's right. We're either
raising a Nobel laureate,

23:37.049 --> 23:38.279
or a mob snitch.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.659
So Ivy, what do we do about her?

23:42.722 --> 23:44.692
I'm all out of ideas.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.696
We're never gonna
find time to make all this.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.902
My parents offered to help,

23:50.963 --> 23:54.533
but they already do
so much for us, I...

23:54.601 --> 23:56.741
I want this dinner to be
a thank you to them.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.073
Just don't take on too much.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.613
Ningo.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.678
We can skip that.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.653
But that's your favorite.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.545
None of the kids like it.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.347
If I'm making it for me,

24:13.419 --> 24:14.589
I can do without.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.264
Hi, Po Po.
Hi, Gung Gung.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.499
Ivy.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.844
I, uh...
I came to help you

24:29.902 --> 24:31.342
clean the restaurant
for New Year's.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.673
All done.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.709
Andrew came over yesterday
after Chinese school.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.605
Brought his own broom.

24:49.388 --> 24:50.558
Ivy.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.891
Have you eaten lunch yet?

24:58.230 --> 25:02.200
Mm. Mm-mm.

25:02.268 --> 25:05.968
You know, it's the juiciest
hamburger in North Beach.

25:06.038 --> 25:10.578
We get tired of eating Chinese
food all the time, too.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.983
When we first came here
from China,

25:13.045 --> 25:14.445
we didn't speak the language

25:14.513 --> 25:16.253
so we never ate a restaurant.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.885
It was not until
I was 19 before I had

25:18.951 --> 25:21.221
my first bite of the
American hamburger.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.859
How old were you when you
first moved here, Gung Gung?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.785
Moved here?
That makes it sound like

25:27.860 --> 25:30.630
we relocated from
Berkeley to Oakland.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.667
We immigrated here.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.732
We uprooted our entire lives,

25:34.801 --> 25:37.271
and left everything behind.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.536
Let's see.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.536
I was a little older than you.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.208
My grandfather was brought here

25:43.275 --> 25:45.775
to work on the Trans
Continental Railroad.

25:45.845 --> 25:50.515
Now, he intended to
make money, return to China.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.623
You know, he ended up
settling in San Francisco.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.756
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hm.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.022
He lived here by himself?

25:57.089 --> 26:00.889
Yeah. Eventually,
they passed a law

26:00.960 --> 26:02.930
so he could bring
his family over.

26:02.995 --> 26:07.025
By then, his only
child, my father,

26:07.099 --> 26:08.639
was already a grown man.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.401
He had children of his own.

26:10.469 --> 26:11.639
- You?
- Mm-hm.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.344
But he promised that
we would have

26:14.406 --> 26:17.506
a better life for
the family in America.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.546
That's why we came.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.452
Was it better?

26:21.513 --> 26:25.223
With everything that's going
on in China right now...

26:25.284 --> 26:28.694
cultural revolution...

26:28.755 --> 26:30.755
we're certain that
we're lucky we're here.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.863
But in the beginning,
nothing was easy.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.256
We were foreigners in this land.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.269
My first week in school,

26:39.331 --> 26:42.231
I had to do a report
about my family.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.541
I was to read it in front
of the entire class.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.074
I... I was so nervous.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.910
I hate speaking
in front of the group, too.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.777
I remember changing everyone's
Chinese names to American ones.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.747
My sister Yinwa
became my sister Karen.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.547
Sumwa became Janet.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.264
Why?

27:03.322 --> 27:04.662
I was embarrassed.

27:04.724 --> 27:08.164
I did not like being
so different.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.827
When we arrived,

27:09.896 --> 27:11.796
we did not know anyone.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.074
We only had our families
for support.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.603
Eight brothers and sisters
is a lot of support.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.339
She could have start a whole
China Town by herself.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.105
- - You will meet them
at the New Year's dinner, Ivy.

27:22.174 --> 27:24.584
Some of them haven't even
seen the restaurant yet.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.853
I can't wait to show it off.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.456
We would not have
all these opportunities

27:28.480 --> 27:31.820
had our families not taken
the risk to come here.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.824
Always remember that, Ivy.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.534
Is this you, Po po?

27:46.598 --> 27:47.868
Yes.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.804
This is you, Gung Gung.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.739
- You were young.
- Still am.

27:54.573 --> 27:57.243
My sister Sumwa.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.509
She's your yipaw.

28:00.579 --> 28:03.079
Thanks Yinwa.
Another yipaw.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.787
You have her chin.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.589
I'm sorry about what I
said the other night.

28:13.659 --> 28:14.729
I love the food you make,

28:14.794 --> 28:16.804

28:18.965 --> 28:20.765

Po Po, Gung Gung. You know
how to make ningo, right?

28:29.641 --> 28:31.941
Ningo.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.404
What's that?

28:49.461 --> 28:51.401
- Ningo. I made it.
- That's cool.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.833
Jerry and I can
throw them like Frisbees.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.396

28:58.470 --> 29:00.140
Yeah. So did Mom.

- Even on beam.

If this was Andrew and he

33:11.490 --> 33:13.890
In fact, they'd
probably love it.

Can I?

34:10.916 --> 34:12.246

34:12.318 --> 34:15.447
if you'd just make me
go to the dinner.

that's right for everyone?

34:24.330 --> 34:26.199

34:26.264 --> 34:28.465

34:28.534 --> 34:30.373
About going to law school.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.596
And it helped you decide to go?

34:32.670 --> 34:35.011
Not in the least.

said stay away.

grandparents' restaurant

34:40.312 --> 34:42.052

have been easier.

I don't know.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.757
I don't know about that.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.725
People are defined...
