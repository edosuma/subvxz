WEBVTT

00:06.624 --> 00:08.661
(Dana breathing heavily)

00:11.399 --> 00:16.175
(Kevin groans, coughs)

00:21.486 --> 00:22.789
(Kevin groans)

00:27.499 --> 00:28.801
Kevin.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.403
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I...

00:31.205 --> 00:32.643
I--

00:32.676 --> 00:35.046
Everything was happening
so fast. I didn't mean--

00:37.217 --> 00:39.122
It was instinct. I'm sorry.

00:39.155 --> 00:40.457
Where's Rufus?

00:41.426 --> 00:42.729
I don't know.

00:47.539 --> 00:48.641
Rufus?

00:54.385 --> 00:56.289
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

00:56.858 --> 00:58.727
Blow your whistle
if you find him first.

01:14.392 --> 01:15.762
RUFUS: Carrie.

01:15.795 --> 01:18.166
(Rufus coughing)

01:18.199 --> 01:19.468
Carrie.

01:21.807 --> 01:23.544
KEVIN: Where the fuck
are you, kid?

01:24.546 --> 01:25.848
Hold it right there, fella.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.326
You think I don't know a thief
when I see one?

01:31.359 --> 01:32.663
What? No. No. No, no.

01:32.696 --> 01:34.633
I'm not a thief. I'm a friend.

01:34.666 --> 01:37.538
I'm a friend of the Wey-- of,
uh, of the Weylins, of Tom.

01:38.607 --> 01:39.743
I'm Kevin.

01:40.912 --> 01:42.548
What's your name?

01:44.218 --> 01:46.524
-(Rufus groaning)
-DANA: Rufus?

01:46.557 --> 01:48.360
RUFUS: Over here.

01:48.393 --> 01:50.598
Rufus. Oh, my God.

01:53.369 --> 01:55.708
(whistle blows)

02:08.233 --> 02:11.172
I-- I think
you should follow me.

02:17.418 --> 02:19.322
(Rufus groaning)

02:19.355 --> 02:21.258
Is this what made you sick?

02:24.933 --> 02:27.371
-KEVIN: Dana?
-DANA: Kevin.

02:27.404 --> 02:29.408
Hey, I think
it's alcohol poisoning.

02:30.578 --> 02:32.616
Slave and I
heard a child in distress.

02:32.649 --> 02:34.886
It was Rufus, so, uh,
we came running for help.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.694
-Rufus.
-(Rufus groaning)

02:38.727 --> 02:40.532
God damn.

02:40.565 --> 02:42.735
You'd think your daddy's son
could hold his liquor.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.274
Dana?

02:45.307 --> 02:46.944
What happened?

02:46.977 --> 02:48.748
Rufus has had himself
a little party.

02:48.781 --> 02:50.751
Jake, you can go on
and get back to work.

02:51.385 --> 02:53.924
-He okay?
-Yeah, I think so.

02:54.325 --> 02:56.463
Carrie came to me running,
crying.

02:56.497 --> 02:59.469
Dragged me all the way out here.
Course she couldn't tell me why.

02:59.503 --> 03:00.839
Must have been
with Young Marse Rufus

03:00.872 --> 03:02.374
when he took ill.

03:02.407 --> 03:03.978
I take that back, Rufus.

03:04.011 --> 03:05.915
You're a lot more like
your daddy than I thought.

03:05.948 --> 03:07.586
(laughs)

03:07.619 --> 03:09.789
I said get back in the fields.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.535
Have you lost your mind?

03:15.568 --> 03:17.304
Drinking in here
with young marse.

03:19.743 --> 03:22.348
RUFUS: Carrie didn't
do nothing wrong.

03:22.381 --> 03:24.520
I'm the one
who stole the whiskey.

03:24.553 --> 03:27.391
Let's, uh, get him
to the kitchen, sober him up.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.328
I'll take you both
to the cookhouse.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.837
(Rufus groaning)

03:37.545 --> 03:39.315
DANA: Hey, hey, Kevin.

03:39.348 --> 03:40.852
Before everything,

03:40.885 --> 03:42.689
Denise told me that
Carrie's a family name.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.425
You're related to Carrie?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.528
I think that's why I'm here.

03:45.561 --> 03:46.931
I think I'm supposed to...

03:46.964 --> 03:48.901
secure the family line
or something.

03:49.268 --> 03:52.308
If anything happens to Carrie,
I don't exist.

03:52.341 --> 03:54.011
KEVIN: Holy shit, Dana.

03:55.615 --> 03:57.485
Was Jake giving you much trouble
back there?

03:57.519 --> 04:00.357
-The new overseer? Sorta.
-(chuckles) Overseer?

04:00.390 --> 04:01.927
He calls himself that?

04:02.862 --> 04:04.800
After Mr. Broadus sold his land,

04:04.833 --> 04:06.670
the Marse Tom plantation
near doubled in size.

04:06.703 --> 04:08.073
Marse thought
I could use a helping hand,

04:08.106 --> 04:10.745
so he brought in Jake,

04:10.778 --> 04:11.981
Margaret's little cousin.

04:12.014 --> 04:13.885
Jake works for you?

04:13.918 --> 04:16.690
I would not call
what Jake does "working."

04:16.723 --> 04:18.761
Ms. Olivia said
you'd be back someday,

04:18.794 --> 04:20.531
but I didn't think
it'd be this long.

04:21.065 --> 04:23.002
I suppose you'll be wanting
to see her.

04:29.014 --> 04:30.985
(chatter)

04:36.997 --> 04:39.669
Carrie, we had a ham
from the smokehouse.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.074
LUKE: Make room for Marse Rufus.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.710
(Rufus groaning)

04:44.244 --> 04:47.384
Somebody get me some water.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.754
Something wrong with him?

04:48.787 --> 04:49.856
LUKE: The boy's drunk.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.560
He don't seem drunk.

04:52.127 --> 04:54.065
Uh, coffee will help.

04:54.098 --> 04:56.035
Oh, coffee?

04:56.068 --> 04:59.542
I'm sorry, sir, I ain't learned
to make that just yet.

05:03.383 --> 05:05.454
-Where's Sarah?
-LUKE: She's in town.

05:05.487 --> 05:08.392
Winnie here, she's been
handling supper of late.

05:11.465 --> 05:13.069
And where have you been
all morning?

05:13.638 --> 05:15.440
Don't act like
you don't hear me.

05:15.473 --> 05:16.944
LUKE: I can take you both
to Miss Olivia,

05:16.977 --> 05:18.514
but it has to be now.

05:18.547 --> 05:19.850
Before Miss Margaret
and Marse Tom

05:19.883 --> 05:21.019
come back with Nigel.

05:21.052 --> 05:23.524
(groans) You can't go.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.761
What if Kevin
stays here with you?

05:35.681 --> 05:37.051
KEVIN: You're not leaving
without me.

05:37.084 --> 05:39.455
Someone has to watch
after Rufus.

05:39.488 --> 05:41.125
What if you get scared?
I'm gonna be stranded.

05:41.158 --> 05:42.896
No, you won't.

05:42.929 --> 05:44.766
Every time he thinks he's
gonna die, I come back.

05:44.799 --> 05:46.469
Okay? If anything happens to me,

05:46.503 --> 05:48.641
-just make sure that happens.
-Sure, okay.

05:48.674 --> 05:50.945
You're not gonna
have to do that. Okay?

05:50.978 --> 05:53.850
But I'm not gonna let you
get stuck here. I promise.

05:54.586 --> 05:55.821
Here.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.696
Tylenol for Rufus.

06:15.528 --> 06:16.963
DANA: Why isn't Sarah
cooking as much?

06:17.865 --> 06:19.603
Fell from Tom's favor.

06:19.636 --> 06:21.640
I'd say it started
a few months back

06:21.673 --> 06:23.644
when Miss Margaret overheard
Sarah calling her a bitch.

06:23.677 --> 06:24.812
(chuckles)

06:25.480 --> 06:28.720
Things between the two of them,
they're getting pretty vile.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.593
Sarah always took it too far.

06:32.762 --> 06:34.766
That's around
when Tom bought Winnie.

06:35.501 --> 06:37.872
It sure wasn't
for her talents in the kitchen.

06:37.905 --> 06:39.910
Why did he buy her?

06:39.943 --> 06:41.847
Tom likes
to have himself a girl.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.717
Right now, that's Winnie.

06:46.923 --> 06:48.627
Olivia said you'd be back,

06:48.660 --> 06:50.029
but she never said nothing
about Mr. Kevin.

06:51.198 --> 06:52.802
What's he to you, anyway?

06:53.336 --> 06:55.039
I know he not your master.

06:56.275 --> 06:58.446
Uh, it's complicated.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.125
What else did she say about me?

07:04.158 --> 07:06.195
Just that she knew you
way back when.

07:07.064 --> 07:08.567
Not much more than that.

07:13.510 --> 07:16.950
-RUFUS: Where's Dana?
-She'll be back soon.

07:16.983 --> 07:20.491
-My head hurts.
-KEVIN: Keep drinking
the coffee.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.093
You know, Rufus,

07:23.195 --> 07:26.704
alcohol is not something
you want to be playing with.

07:26.737 --> 07:27.906
Why'd you steal it?

07:27.939 --> 07:29.810
I was bored.

07:29.843 --> 07:32.180
Why don't you play
with your friends instead?

07:34.953 --> 07:36.556
I don't got no friends.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.595
Daddy either sold 'em
or they got to work now.

07:49.047 --> 07:51.619
I didn't have a lot of friends
when I was your age either.

07:52.353 --> 07:54.726
RUFUS:
Well, how did you find Dana?

07:58.767 --> 08:00.103
(knocking)

08:07.752 --> 08:08.820
Hey.

08:09.454 --> 08:11.493
OLIVIA: You made it back.

08:13.162 --> 08:14.732
(chuckles)

08:18.774 --> 08:19.876
Well...

08:21.212 --> 08:22.715
come on in then.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.661
DANA: I brought some supplies

08:28.694 --> 08:29.763
in case there's anything
you need.

08:29.796 --> 08:31.265
Wait. Is this...

08:34.672 --> 08:36.676
Oh, my God.

08:37.144 --> 08:38.647
Oh!

08:38.680 --> 08:40.818
(chuckles) I could die.

08:42.287 --> 08:46.963
I haven't tasted chocolate
or coconut in... how long?

08:47.698 --> 08:49.268
Mmm!

08:49.301 --> 08:51.539
I can't stay long.
Kevin's back at the house.

08:52.207 --> 08:53.911
You brought that white boy back?

08:53.944 --> 08:55.180
Yeah, well,
every time I come here,

08:55.213 --> 08:56.884
I get beat up or poisoned, so...

08:56.917 --> 08:58.219
Girl, I ain't poison you.

08:59.221 --> 09:00.289
I scared you.

09:02.093 --> 09:03.296
And it worked, didn't it?

09:03.329 --> 09:05.032
I got you out of here.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.705
Yeah, for a couple hours.

09:07.738 --> 09:10.577
A couple of hours has been
three years for me.

09:11.345 --> 09:14.184
Three years really stuck here.

09:15.053 --> 09:16.155
No.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.927
No, you're not stuck.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.200
It made the trip.

09:24.171 --> 09:25.339
So you can too.

09:27.344 --> 09:29.348
OLIVIA: That's just
a piece of metal.

09:29.381 --> 09:30.884
What do you...

09:32.153 --> 09:34.258
Things have changed, Dana.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.996
There is no more going
back for me, not anymore.

09:37.598 --> 09:40.136
There is no
easy way to say this, but...

09:41.238 --> 09:43.977
Alice and I
are leaving Maryland.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.816
We're heading north.

09:47.952 --> 09:49.756
You're what?

09:49.789 --> 09:52.795
Maybe as far as Canada
if we can.

09:52.828 --> 09:55.701
-So you're just gonna leave me?
-She's my responsibility. I--

09:55.734 --> 09:57.906
You said you were gonna find
someone to take care of her.

09:57.939 --> 10:00.243
-OLIVIA: I tried.
-She's not even your kid!

10:00.276 --> 10:01.746
OLIVIA: Dana.

10:03.784 --> 10:05.319
Look at what is happening here.

10:06.055 --> 10:07.290
All around you.

10:08.794 --> 10:10.697
There are people
who are suffering.

10:11.232 --> 10:12.936
Real people.

10:12.969 --> 10:14.806
People who need to be
taken care of.

10:14.839 --> 10:17.077
That's what I've chosen to do
with my situation.

10:17.110 --> 10:19.014
Our situation.

10:19.047 --> 10:21.152
There's actually more
you could be doing.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.323
You could be
helping other folks.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.327
Instead of worrying about me,

10:25.360 --> 10:26.996
why don't you ask yourself...

10:29.301 --> 10:30.805
what should you be doing?

10:30.838 --> 10:32.006
(knock at door)

10:36.081 --> 10:37.751
LUKE: It's time I head back.

10:38.118 --> 10:40.758
Dana, you need a ride, or are
you good to find your way back

10:40.791 --> 10:42.126
-on your own?
-Nope. Coming with you.

10:44.031 --> 10:45.132
(clatter)

10:51.412 --> 10:53.048
LUKE: What's the matter?

10:54.451 --> 10:55.955
(Dana sobs)

10:55.988 --> 10:57.725
I don't know. (sobs)

11:25.380 --> 11:29.054
Mr. Franklin.
What a wonderful surprise!

11:29.087 --> 11:30.924
Have you been waiting long?

11:33.930 --> 11:36.102
Rufus, you're fidgeting.
What is the matter?

11:36.135 --> 11:37.471
Oh, he's just got
a little chill.

11:37.505 --> 11:39.241
Nothing to worry about.

11:39.274 --> 11:43.049
Still a man of, uh, fashion,
I see. (chuckles)

11:43.082 --> 11:44.318
MARGARET:
Well, where's his coat?

11:44.351 --> 11:45.955
Let's get him dressed.

11:45.988 --> 11:47.457
To what do we owe
this unforeseen visit?

11:47.490 --> 11:49.061
Well, you see, I was just, uh,

11:49.094 --> 11:52.267
traveling north back home.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.204
Passing through.

11:54.237 --> 11:56.041
Thought I'd say hello
while I was in Maryland

11:57.410 --> 11:59.883
And your slave?
Have you sold her?

11:59.916 --> 12:04.124
Sol-- Oh, no, no! Oh, no, no.
Uh, just sent her on an errand.

12:08.366 --> 12:12.942
You know, Kevin, last time
you were here, around Christmas,

12:13.811 --> 12:17.017
I recall the festivities
got a little out of hand.

12:17.050 --> 12:19.154
-Yes, and I'm so sorry for that.
-Nonsense.

12:19.187 --> 12:22.260
I assume you fled into
the night out of embarrassment,

12:22.293 --> 12:24.264
but no matter.

12:24.297 --> 12:29.274
What you told me then
about Broadus', uh, deviance,

12:29.909 --> 12:33.349
I let him know that my silence
came at a price.

12:33.851 --> 12:37.157
He signed his land over to me
the very next day.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.994
Virgin soil.

12:39.027 --> 12:42.333
We doubled our crop output
every year since.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.006
Well, Mr. Franklin,
you must stay for supper.

12:45.039 --> 12:46.543
-TOM: Absolutely.
-(Margaret chuckles)

12:46.576 --> 12:48.379
MARGARET: This way.

12:48.412 --> 12:50.283
SARAH: There is no time
to make another one.

12:50.316 --> 12:52.254
WINNIE: But there
is a slice missing.

12:52.287 --> 12:54.825
Carrie, get over here.

12:56.896 --> 12:59.100
Did you see who took this cake?

13:00.637 --> 13:03.342
Carrie, I swear,
if you don't tell me--

13:03.375 --> 13:05.046
DANA: Rufus had a slice
earlier in the barn.

13:05.079 --> 13:07.116
-And who are you?
-It's Dana.

13:08.987 --> 13:10.122
Dana.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.164
Rufus must have stole a slice
this morning.

13:14.197 --> 13:15.300
I saw him with it.

13:15.333 --> 13:16.903
Is this true?

13:20.309 --> 13:21.378
Now go on.

13:22.982 --> 13:25.286
My cake's still ruined.

13:25.319 --> 13:27.457
If you don't calm down
and use your head...

13:27.490 --> 13:29.562
Just cut it up into slices.

13:29.595 --> 13:33.302
Shoot, Massa Tom don't care
how your food tastes.

13:33.335 --> 13:35.306
He know you gonna
make it up to him tonight.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.882
I'll be setting a table.

13:46.930 --> 13:48.132
And you.

13:48.968 --> 13:51.172
What brings you
back into my cookhouse?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.308
I go where Mr. Kevin goes.

13:55.547 --> 13:58.085
And wasn't you with child
last you left here?

13:58.987 --> 14:00.289
I, um...

14:01.993 --> 14:03.228
lost the baby.

14:14.417 --> 14:17.357
Don't matter if they're gone
with God or to Virginia.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.027
Hurts the same.

14:24.237 --> 14:25.941
Carrie all I got left.

14:31.385 --> 14:35.259
I didn't notice a horse
in our carriage house.

14:35.828 --> 14:37.531
How did you get here,
Mr. Franklin?

14:38.399 --> 14:40.103
I walked.

14:40.136 --> 14:41.672
You must be staying
in Easton then.

14:42.574 --> 14:44.579
I had wondered
where your things were,

14:44.612 --> 14:46.516
your instruments.

14:46.549 --> 14:49.288
I don't suppose
you were robbed again.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.392
No, that would be crazy.

14:51.425 --> 14:53.095
We're trying to--

14:53.128 --> 14:56.268
I mean, I'm-- I'm--
I'm trying to live simply.

14:56.301 --> 14:57.403
Mmm.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.178
No. Thanks.

15:01.211 --> 15:03.049
Not a smoking man.

15:03.082 --> 15:04.618
You're no fun.

15:07.190 --> 15:08.493
Winnie.

15:09.027 --> 15:11.566
-Do come here.
-Yes, Marse.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.235
TOM: What...

15:17.176 --> 15:20.483
Why are you not wearing
your new dress?

15:20.517 --> 15:23.222
I didn't want it getting
dirty in the cookhouse, sir.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.692
TOM: Mmm.

15:24.725 --> 15:27.965
Well, do put it on
before dinner, mmm?

15:29.569 --> 15:30.971
Yes, sir.

15:33.309 --> 15:34.377
Okay.

15:37.217 --> 15:38.285
Hmm.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.028
I have her set up
in her own lodging.

15:43.563 --> 15:45.734
It's quite a privilege
for a slave.

15:46.502 --> 15:47.705
Oh, yeah.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.441
Yes, I much prefer it

15:49.474 --> 15:51.478
to ruttin' in the dirt
like a pair of hogs,

15:51.512 --> 15:53.182
and it...

15:53.215 --> 15:55.554
provides us
a modicum of privacy.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.363
The other slaves refer to it
as the Jezebel Cabin.

16:00.396 --> 16:02.033
(laughs)

16:02.066 --> 16:05.005
Which, I must confess,
it delights me.

16:06.275 --> 16:11.218
She provides a comfort
I have not felt

16:11.251 --> 16:13.088
since my Hannah departed.

16:14.492 --> 16:16.696
It's only fitting
that she wear her dress.

16:18.399 --> 16:19.501
Hmm.

16:21.572 --> 16:23.576
Dana, come help grind this.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.630
When young Master Rufus
stole that cake,

16:34.498 --> 16:36.034
anything happen to him?

16:36.836 --> 16:38.338
What do you mean?

16:39.775 --> 16:41.378
He didn't get sick or nothing?

16:42.380 --> 16:44.217
You mean from the whiskey?

16:44.250 --> 16:45.587
What whiskey?

16:47.791 --> 16:49.662
I put a little something
in the icing.

16:49.695 --> 16:51.532
DANA: What do you mean?

16:52.066 --> 16:55.205
Two bites and won't nobody
ask Winnie to cook supper
ever again.

17:04.492 --> 17:05.760
TOM: Mmm. Thank you, Winnie.

17:09.134 --> 17:10.270
(Tom clears throat)

17:10.303 --> 17:13.342
(leather squeaking)

17:15.313 --> 17:17.417
Corn pudding was inedible.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.387
No one touched it. Look around.

17:20.356 --> 17:21.860
Apologies, Ms. Margaret.

17:21.893 --> 17:23.830
(shoe squeaking)

17:24.699 --> 17:25.801
TOM: Rufus.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.672
(squeaking continues)

17:27.705 --> 17:30.109
-I said stop, boy.
-(squeaking stops)

17:30.611 --> 17:32.146
(Margaret clears throat)

17:35.721 --> 17:38.693
(knife scraping)

17:39.361 --> 17:40.564
What did I say?

17:40.597 --> 17:42.802
-It's my fault.
-What?

17:42.835 --> 17:45.741
I, uh, I gave him
a cup of coffee earlier

17:45.774 --> 17:47.410
to help his headache.

17:47.443 --> 17:49.782
Tom, sit down, please.

17:52.588 --> 17:55.125
You know, he's always
like this, hmm?

17:55.660 --> 17:59.836
Insolent and distracted.
He evades education.

17:59.869 --> 18:01.706
I mean,
if you heard the boy read,

18:01.739 --> 18:04.143
you'd think he came
from the same pig farm as Jake.

18:04.845 --> 18:08.619
Yeah, I noticed that you don't
drink much, Mr. Franklin.

18:09.020 --> 18:13.195
I've always found temperance
in a man rather admirable.

18:13.228 --> 18:14.899
Oh, thank you.

18:14.932 --> 18:17.337
You know,
Preacher Wilson tells us

18:17.370 --> 18:18.840
that alcohol...

18:20.476 --> 18:22.715
diverts us
from a righteous path.

18:22.748 --> 18:24.283
Shut up, Margaret.

18:25.185 --> 18:27.490
Why don't you ask
your son about his detour

18:27.524 --> 18:29.293
from the righteous path
this morning?

18:29.895 --> 18:31.465
Jake, please don't.

18:31.499 --> 18:32.802
TOM: What are you talking about?

18:32.835 --> 18:35.741
I caught him
in the tobacco barn.

18:35.774 --> 18:37.343
Negress with him too.

18:37.376 --> 18:39.214
Carrie.

18:39.247 --> 18:40.750
Two of them was canoodling,
I'm pretty reckon sure.

18:42.253 --> 18:43.957
-Margaret.
-How dare you?

18:43.990 --> 18:45.728
JAKE:
I'm just telling the truth.

18:45.761 --> 18:47.330
Well, it is not true.

18:47.363 --> 18:48.934
Ask him then.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.570
He was there too.

18:53.643 --> 18:55.580
Mr. Franklin, is this true?

19:06.803 --> 19:09.509
Tom, I want
that mute little slut gone.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.278
-We were just playing.
-Sit down.

19:11.311 --> 19:13.917
I will not let her
corrupt my son!

19:13.950 --> 19:15.521
-Not under my own roof.
-She's my friend!

19:15.554 --> 19:17.223
She is a temptress.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.361
Sell her
along with her bitch mother

19:19.394 --> 19:21.499
when you get rid of her
at month's end.

19:21.532 --> 19:22.868
Now, Rufus!

19:24.939 --> 19:27.645
Rufus! Rufus!

19:27.678 --> 19:30.450
You're a goddamn fool for saying
that in front of Margaret.

19:30.483 --> 19:31.619
I'm just telling the truth.

19:32.253 --> 19:34.826
-Unlike some people.
-Quiet!

19:34.859 --> 19:37.430
-I told her.
-JAKE: Hmm?

19:37.463 --> 19:39.802
I cannot sell Sarah until
Winnie is properly trained.

19:39.835 --> 19:42.440
My house
will fall into disarray.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.877
(sighs)

19:43.910 --> 19:45.713
You know, I had hoped
to keep Carrie.

19:46.247 --> 19:49.488
There's no point
in losing a female in her prime.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.693
But perhaps Margaret is correct.

19:51.726 --> 19:55.500
And Carrie serves no purpose
without Sarah.

19:56.836 --> 19:58.806
Uh, please excuse me.

20:01.444 --> 20:03.550
Hey. Hey. There you are.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.419
Hey. Sorry, I got caught up
with Sarah.

20:05.452 --> 20:08.292
They want to sell
Carrie and Sarah.

20:08.325 --> 20:09.528
-What?
-What'd you say?

20:11.799 --> 20:12.934
Sarah.

20:13.703 --> 20:16.308
My God, I knew they
was preparing Winnie
to take my place,

20:16.341 --> 20:17.677
I knew it,
but I never thought...

20:20.617 --> 20:23.757
I've been here longer than
that entire no-good family.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.326
What did Tom say?

20:25.359 --> 20:27.498
I don't think
Tom wants to sell Carrie.

20:27.531 --> 20:29.569
Margaret, she found
out about Rufus and Carrie

20:29.602 --> 20:31.472
being together
in the tobacco barn earlier,

20:31.506 --> 20:32.874
and she lost it.

20:34.612 --> 20:36.549
Carrie's safe. Okay?

20:37.518 --> 20:39.020
We can convince Tom to keep you.

20:39.053 --> 20:40.322
We?

20:41.358 --> 20:43.428
How you gonna convince him?

20:46.502 --> 20:48.607
I will not be separated
from my daughter.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.511
I'd rather run.

20:50.544 --> 20:51.712
MARGARET: Help!

20:52.380 --> 20:54.618
Help! Help!

20:55.086 --> 20:57.724
There's something wrong! Please!

20:58.626 --> 21:01.599
(Tom groaning)

21:01.632 --> 21:04.404
-RUFUS: Mommy?
-(Tom groaning)

21:04.437 --> 21:07.343
(Margaret vomiting, coughing)

21:07.376 --> 21:12.587
(Jake and Tom vomiting
and coughing)

21:14.725 --> 21:21.872
(Margaret, Tom,
and Jake groaning)

21:27.049 --> 21:29.689
Maybe Carrie and I
ought to run right now

21:29.722 --> 21:30.958
while the white folk indisposed.

21:30.991 --> 21:33.730
No. No, you can't run.

21:33.763 --> 21:35.500
This is your home.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.005
I will not let us get sold.
You hear me?

21:38.038 --> 21:39.809
I will not.

21:39.842 --> 21:42.347
Even if that means
I got to crawl through the dirt

21:42.380 --> 21:44.050
and make it to Philadelphia.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.722
-OLIVIA: Where would
you even go?
-I don't know.

21:49.127 --> 21:50.964
Sarah. Sarah.

21:50.997 --> 21:52.534
Look at me.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.506
Look at me.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.046
You're not gonna run,
and you're not gonna get sold.

22:00.850 --> 22:02.821
-I'm gonna take care of this.
-SARAH: How?

22:02.854 --> 22:04.691
What you gonna do?

22:06.428 --> 22:08.633
I can't tell you.
I-- You just have to trust me.

22:10.737 --> 22:12.641
Sarah spiraling
is gonna fuck us.

22:12.674 --> 22:14.946
DANA: Sarah told me she
laced the cake with some root.

22:14.979 --> 22:16.816
I don't know, but that's what
made Rufus ill earlier,

22:16.849 --> 22:19.054
not the alcohol.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.091
She wanted to make everyone sick
and blame it on Winnie.

22:21.124 --> 22:22.995
And now she's threatening
to run away with Carrie,

22:23.028 --> 22:24.130
which is just as bad.

22:24.163 --> 22:26.603
How is that just as bad?

22:26.636 --> 22:28.005
Because she'll get caught.

22:28.038 --> 22:29.809
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

22:29.842 --> 22:31.546
She'll get sold down south
or worse,

22:31.579 --> 22:33.415
and that will cosmically fuck me

22:33.448 --> 22:35.553
because we need Carrie
and Rufus here together.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.931
I have a plan, but I can't tell
if it's brilliant

22:40.964 --> 22:42.534
or the dumbest thing
I've ever done.

22:43.603 --> 22:44.705
(Dana sighs)

22:44.738 --> 22:46.843
I convince Winnie to run away.

22:46.876 --> 22:48.947
Dana, no, that's-- that's crazy.

22:48.980 --> 22:51.451
You said it yourself,
Tom needs a cook.

22:51.484 --> 22:53.556
There are too many slaves
to go without one.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.092
That way, they'll have to keep
Sarah and Carrie.

22:58.165 --> 22:59.935
I'm gonna take her to Olivia's.

23:05.513 --> 23:07.116
Winnie?

23:08.820 --> 23:10.857
Why are you here?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.026
Um...

23:14.130 --> 23:16.134
Mr. Franklin sent you?

23:16.167 --> 23:17.971
Mmm-mmm, no. Uh...

23:20.610 --> 23:21.845
I came to warn you.

23:23.750 --> 23:24.885
Warn me?

23:28.793 --> 23:30.630
Tom wants to sell you.

23:34.237 --> 23:36.642
Yeah, I heard him talking
to Mr. Kevin.

23:36.675 --> 23:40.583
-What happened wasn't my fault.
-But that's not what Tom thinks.

23:41.151 --> 23:42.688
Then I'll tell him myself.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.990
He won't believe you.

23:46.662 --> 23:49.034
Then I'll beg.
I'll beg for forgiveness.

23:49.067 --> 23:50.737
It's too late.

24:03.663 --> 24:06.969
Last month,
he sent a girl down to Carolina

24:07.002 --> 24:08.171
for talking back.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.912
I heard it's real bad
down there.

24:13.716 --> 24:15.653
I can make sure
that doesn't happen to you.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.189
How?

24:19.528 --> 24:20.930
I'm not really a slave.

24:24.003 --> 24:25.807
Then why are you here?

24:26.876 --> 24:28.144
To help people,

24:29.113 --> 24:30.482
people like you...

24:33.990 --> 24:35.058
to be free.

24:38.131 --> 24:39.835
Do you want to be free?

24:39.868 --> 24:42.941
-I-- I don't understand.
-Do you want to be free?

24:49.621 --> 24:51.826
I always knew
Winnie was a shit cook,

24:51.859 --> 24:53.763
but I never thought
it would be this bad.

24:55.567 --> 24:57.270
Maybe I ought
to see Winnie tonight.

24:57.303 --> 24:59.107
No. No.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.543
You...

25:03.048 --> 25:06.522
You don't want her
to see you weakened.

25:07.156 --> 25:08.693
Mmm.

25:08.726 --> 25:09.861
Take a seat.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.609
So... (clears throat)

25:16.642 --> 25:19.246
...tell me, Kevin,
what are your goals?

25:20.617 --> 25:21.786
Goals?

25:21.819 --> 25:25.059
TOM: Your intentions.

25:25.092 --> 25:26.729
What has brought you here?

25:26.762 --> 25:28.600
What is it you plan
to do with yourself?

25:28.633 --> 25:29.968
To own land?

25:34.912 --> 25:36.582
Mr. Franklin...

25:37.918 --> 25:39.253
let us tell each other
the truth.

25:40.757 --> 25:42.293
The truth?

25:42.326 --> 25:45.967
I do not believe
your belongings are in Easton.

25:46.502 --> 25:49.006
Or that you have even
procured lodging there.

25:50.677 --> 25:54.217
You are penniless, are you not?

25:54.250 --> 25:56.087
And you've come through here

25:56.120 --> 25:58.692
hoping that I might provide
some kind of patronage.

25:59.962 --> 26:01.632
You're right. I...

26:04.103 --> 26:06.642
I was hoping, uh,

26:06.675 --> 26:09.881
that if--
if you would allow it, Tom...

26:11.217 --> 26:13.889
that I could stay here awhile.

26:15.192 --> 26:16.895
You know,
find a way to earn my keep.

26:19.835 --> 26:21.270
Hmm...

26:22.373 --> 26:24.343
Your honesty is appreciated.

26:25.747 --> 26:27.918
Well, I suppose Rufus
might benefit

26:27.951 --> 26:30.189
from your music tutelage.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.928
I do not have high hopes
for the boy's musicality,

26:32.961 --> 26:34.931
but you will do your best, hmm?

26:36.100 --> 26:37.169
I, uh...

26:37.837 --> 26:39.207
Thank you.

26:39.240 --> 26:41.177
We'll discuss terms
in the morning.

26:48.358 --> 26:49.962
Are you okay? Winnie.

26:49.995 --> 26:51.063
Are you okay?

27:03.723 --> 27:06.127
-DANA: Let's go.
-WINNIE: Are you sure?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.664
DANA: Yes.

27:45.807 --> 27:47.944
(sighs) Come on, Dana.

27:50.917 --> 27:52.286
Where are you?

28:10.556 --> 28:11.892
WINNIE: We close?

28:11.925 --> 28:13.796
Should be somewhere around here.

28:19.006 --> 28:20.141
So...

28:20.910 --> 28:23.282
where were you
before you came to Easton?

28:23.315 --> 28:25.085
WINNIE: Virginia.

28:25.554 --> 28:27.189
Few months back,
the old master died

28:27.222 --> 28:29.928
and every last one of us
got sold.

28:29.961 --> 28:31.331
Is that where Tom bought you?

28:31.364 --> 28:32.900
Tom...

28:33.969 --> 28:35.807
took a liking to me.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.913
All the others hated him for it,
you could tell that bit.

28:38.946 --> 28:41.752
But at least he took me
out of them fields.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.191
DANA: We're here.

28:47.296 --> 28:48.866
(knocking on door)

28:52.841 --> 28:54.277
OLIVIA: Dana.

28:54.310 --> 28:56.949
You brought a runaway
into my home?

28:56.982 --> 28:58.352
She didn't know we was coming?

28:58.385 --> 29:00.055
Winnie, it's gonna be fine.

29:00.088 --> 29:01.926
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

29:01.959 --> 29:03.462
I shouldn't have come here.

29:03.496 --> 29:04.898
-I should not be--
-Shh!

29:06.869 --> 29:09.107
I thought you wanted me to do
more for the people here.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.342
So I am.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.213
I-- I-- I'm trying to help.

29:12.246 --> 29:14.483
You must know
how Tom treats her.

29:24.203 --> 29:25.338
Come in.

29:41.003 --> 29:42.172
Get in.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.294
Here. Take this.

29:53.796 --> 29:55.265
I'll bring you something to eat.

29:55.298 --> 29:56.935
Come on.

30:02.045 --> 30:04.383
-Where you going?
-I have to get back to Kevin.

30:05.285 --> 30:07.122
I thought you not a slave.

30:07.924 --> 30:09.226
I'm not.

30:11.330 --> 30:13.468
You think he loves you,
don't you?

30:15.338 --> 30:16.407
He don't.

30:17.276 --> 30:18.378
He can't.

30:18.780 --> 30:20.415
It ain't in their nature.

30:23.221 --> 30:25.058
I'm ready.

30:25.091 --> 30:28.364
OLIVIA: Okay. Now, sit tight
and I'll be right back.

30:40.489 --> 30:42.460
You of all people
know it's dangerous

30:42.494 --> 30:43.996
to walk these woods at night.

30:46.602 --> 30:50.442
Don't come back until I figure
out how to get the girl out.

30:53.949 --> 30:55.051
I'll send word.

30:58.626 --> 31:00.329

DANA: It's done.

31:43.549 --> 31:45.151
Winnie's at Olivia's.

31:47.757 --> 31:49.494
Did anybody see you?

31:52.700 --> 31:55.005
No. Just Luke.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.708
Is that something
we need to worry about?

31:58.278 --> 31:59.346
No.

32:00.181 --> 32:01.651
I don't think so.

32:16.147 --> 32:18.652
Olivia doesn't wanna
come back home with me.

32:19.153 --> 32:21.124
-Really?
-OLIVIA: Yeah.

32:21.157 --> 32:23.194
She wants to stay with Alice.

32:39.260 --> 32:42.365
-Sorry.
-No. I'm sorry.

32:44.069 --> 32:45.739
I shouldn't have
brought you back here.

32:50.081 --> 32:51.483
Why did you?

32:55.826 --> 32:58.498
I want to say
it was instinct, but...

33:00.603 --> 33:02.339
I think a part of me
just realized

33:02.372 --> 33:04.577
how much harder
all this would be without you.

33:05.713 --> 33:07.583
I just got so scared.

33:11.324 --> 33:13.394
I don't wanna
have to do this alone.

33:23.649 --> 33:26.153
I took a job tutoring Rufus.

33:28.659 --> 33:30.630
It'll put us close to him
for the time being,

33:30.663 --> 33:34.370
and if we go back tomorrow,
great,

33:34.403 --> 33:36.608
but if not,
then at least we have a cover.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.248
-Kevin.
-KEVIN: And Rufus,

33:40.281 --> 33:42.386
he's gonna be
in charge of this place someday,

33:42.419 --> 33:47.195
and maybe he'll be like Tom,
but maybe not.

33:48.197 --> 33:49.701
Maybe I'm naïve,

33:49.734 --> 33:52.239
but I think us being here
could be good for him,

33:52.272 --> 33:56.280
and he's young, he's malleable,

33:58.484 --> 34:00.389
and he loves you.

34:00.422 --> 34:02.727
(chuckles) He doesn't love me.

34:02.760 --> 34:05.633
Oh, oh, yeah, he does.

34:05.666 --> 34:08.639
Big time.
I've got major competition.

35:52.814 --> 35:54.450

35:54.483 --> 35:56.655
You stay. You stay. I'll go.

(chatter and bell ringing
continue)

36:04.269 --> 36:05.405
TOM: Luke!

36:18.832 --> 36:20.870
You are to dress me from now on.

36:20.903 --> 36:24.410
Celeste has become too unsightly
with her vulgar pregnancy,

36:24.443 --> 36:27.783
and this way,
I can keep my eye on you.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.327
You ought to learn from
your father's mistakes, Rufus.

36:36.968 --> 36:39.808
But you are becoming
a young man.

36:39.841 --> 36:41.711
Perhaps it's time
for you to find a wife.

36:46.855 --> 36:50.295
Massa let me know you're going
to be staying a good long while

36:50.328 --> 36:51.765
since Mr. Kevin
gonna tutor the boy.

36:53.735 --> 36:56.273
I suppose that means
I'll be putting you to work.
