(SIGHS)

00:15.028 --> 00:17.008
What's the matter?

00:17.068 --> 00:18.728
Nothing.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.328
Very convincing.

00:22.388 --> 00:24.128
Look, I know
I'm the sunshine of your life.

00:24.188 --> 00:25.528
The...?
Sunshine of your life.

00:25.588 --> 00:26.608
I avoid the sun.

00:26.668 --> 00:28.168
It's important for you
to be able to look at me

00:28.228 --> 00:29.568
and see me having a great time.

00:29.628 --> 00:30.728
Never really thought about it.

00:30.788 --> 00:32.488
But even the sun has to go down
sometimes.

00:32.548 --> 00:33.648
Every day.

00:33.708 --> 00:36.728
It's just...you know I love it here,

00:36.788 --> 00:40.328
but recently, I've been...
missing the mainland a bit.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.608
Do you hate me?

00:41.668 --> 00:43.328
No, it's normal.
You miss your family.

00:43.388 --> 00:44.928
Shops.
The shops?

00:44.988 --> 00:46.408
The services.

00:46.468 --> 00:48.008
Three-storey buildings.

00:48.068 --> 00:49.928
Those rental bikes
people throw in trees.

00:49.988 --> 00:51.168
The city?

00:51.228 --> 00:54.488
I think mainly I miss being able to
get whatever service I wanted to get

00:54.548 --> 00:55.928
whenever I wanted to get it.

00:55.988 --> 00:58.328
You know, like...getting a tattoo.

00:58.388 --> 01:00.568
Or...laser tattoo removal.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.728
Or...reiki.
What is reiki?

01:02.788 --> 01:05.608
I don't know, and now I never will,
because we don't have it here.

01:05.668 --> 01:06.728
You can google it.

01:06.788 --> 01:09.008
And Rosehaven doesn't even have
somewhere you can get a massage.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.408
Or a facial.
Or pampery things like that.

01:11.468 --> 01:12.888
What about the noticeboard?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.968
Reading the noticeboard
is not pampering yourself.

01:15.028 --> 01:17.488
No, no, you can put something up.
"Hi. I'm Emma. I want a massage."

01:17.548 --> 01:18.928
That makes me sound desperate.

01:18.988 --> 01:20.608
You could add,
"Not a big deal, though."

01:20.668 --> 01:23.208
I don't know why Rosehaven
doesn't have a massage place.

01:23.268 --> 01:25.168
Probably just not enough demand
for one.

01:25.228 --> 01:28.328
Course there is.
The market is anyone with a body.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.728
Maybe I should open a day spa.

01:29.788 --> 01:30.888
I've never had one.

01:30.948 --> 01:33.368
I just don't see how a stranger
prodding me could help me relax.

01:33.428 --> 01:35.648
That clinches it.
You can be my first customer.

01:35.708 --> 01:36.768
I'm doing it!

01:36.828 --> 01:39.928
I'm gonna open Rosehaven's first,
soon to be world-famous,

01:39.988 --> 01:41.728
massage centre and day spa!

01:42.708 --> 01:45.208
Well, you'll need to get certified if
you want to start operating as a...

01:45.268 --> 01:46.608
Ugh! Too hard. I'm not doing it.

01:46.668 --> 01:49.088
# Yeah, we know

01:49.148 --> 01:52.728
# Even if we had so far to go

01:52.788 --> 01:55.728
# Even if the pace is slow

01:55.788 --> 01:59.048
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again

02:01.068 --> 02:03.688
# If we find

02:03.748 --> 02:07.648
# Something to feel that we belong

02:07.708 --> 02:10.768
# If we could right all the wrongs

02:10.828 --> 02:14.008

to you again. #

for 14 kilometres.

02:26.228 --> 02:28.048
Jesus! How far away is this place?

02:28.108 --> 02:30.648
Well, at least 14 kilometres.
Ugh!

02:30.708 --> 02:32.208
Think of it as a great opportunity

02:32.268 --> 02:34.368
to view the beautiful
Tasmanian countryside.

02:35.508 --> 02:36.888
It's fine.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.368
OK, after this appraisal,

02:38.428 --> 02:41.408
why don't you and I do something
we used to do on the mainland?

02:41.468 --> 02:43.608
Like what? Go on a pub crawl?

02:43.668 --> 02:46.968
Well, there's only one pub,
but we can go there twice.

02:47.028 --> 02:48.128
I mean, that's just it.

02:48.188 --> 02:50.608
Once you've lived here a while,
you've done everything heaps.

02:50.668 --> 02:51.848
There's nothing new.

02:51.908 --> 02:54.328
That's not true.
There is one thing you haven't done.

02:54.388 --> 02:55.688
What?

02:55.748 --> 02:57.008
It's a secret.

02:57.068 --> 02:58.328
What is it?!

02:58.388 --> 03:01.648
It is a special Rosehaven activity
that you can only do here.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.528
I was saving it
for a special occasion,

03:03.588 --> 03:05.368
but being bored also counts.

03:05.428 --> 03:07.968
First, never keep anything
from me again.

03:08.028 --> 03:10.968
Second, thank you for keeping this
from me this time!

03:11.028 --> 03:12.808
You're welcome.

03:18.388 --> 03:20.088
Give me a clue of what it is?

03:20.148 --> 03:21.208
No clues.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.488
Is it sticky-taping popcorn
to the engine of Greg's police car

03:24.548 --> 03:27.288
so that when the engine heats up,
he'll think he's in a shoot-out?

03:27.348 --> 03:29.328
"Pa! Pa-pa! Pa!"
No. No, not that.

03:30.948 --> 03:32.728
The appraisal won't take long,
right?

03:32.788 --> 03:34.968
Like, we just walk around and figure
out how much we could sell it for

03:35.028 --> 03:36.608
and then convince him
to let us sell it?

03:36.668 --> 03:38.288
Yep.
Five minutes?

03:38.348 --> 03:40.448
Ish. To an hour.

03:40.508 --> 03:41.688
An hour?!

03:41.748 --> 03:44.048
Well, as long as it takes
to land the listing.

03:44.108 --> 03:45.888
I'm gonna convince him
in one minute.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.048
How?

03:47.108 --> 03:49.568
Beg, cry, threaten, in that order.

03:49.628 --> 03:51.528
Let me try first.

03:51.588 --> 03:53.608
Your map lady hasn't said anything
in a while.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.008
It's off.

03:57.068 --> 03:58.528
There's no reception!
Hmm?

03:58.588 --> 04:00.048
How long has it been off?

04:00.108 --> 04:02.488
How long have we been going
in the wrong direction?

04:02.548 --> 04:04.048
Are we lost? Do you have any flares?

04:04.108 --> 04:05.808
We're fine. Just keep your eye
on where we're headed.

04:05.868 --> 04:08.448
I can't.
There's no blue line anymore.

04:08.508 --> 04:10.648
We should go back. I think
I can remember how to get home.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.008
We're OK. Open the glove box.

04:15.428 --> 04:16.968
This?
Yeah, it's a map.

04:17.028 --> 04:18.288
Look up Backers Creek.

04:18.348 --> 04:19.928
I think that was
the last sign we saw.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.168
This looks pretty old.
What if it's wrong?

04:22.228 --> 04:24.488
Oh, the roads wouldn't have
changed much out here.

04:24.548 --> 04:26.168
But how does it know where we are?

04:28.748 --> 04:34.328
Errrrrmmmmm...

04:34.388 --> 04:35.848
You've been making that sound
for a long time.

04:35.908 --> 04:37.608
It's my concentrating sound.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.288
You think I don't know your sounds?

04:39.348 --> 04:42.368
Your concentrating sound
is "ehhhhhh".

04:42.428 --> 04:45.008
And this is your
getting-out-of-a-low-chair sound.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.928
"Huh!"
It IS my concentrating sound.

04:46.988 --> 04:49.688
And if I can't hear myself doing it,
I can't concentrate.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.968
Is it upside down?

04:51.028 --> 04:54.488
In movies, 90% of map problems are
because it's upside down.

04:54.548 --> 04:55.888
It's not upside down.

04:55.948 --> 04:57.768
Have you tried
turning it off and on again?

04:59.988 --> 05:01.408
Still the same.

05:03.988 --> 05:05.928
OK, I think I see where we're going.

05:05.988 --> 05:07.328
Do you?

05:07.388 --> 05:09.008
Yep. Yep.

05:09.068 --> 05:10.368
Yeah, we're fine. We're good.

05:11.668 --> 05:14.208
Is it like a magic eye puzzle?
Because I'm not seeing anything.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.928
I can guide.
Oh.

05:22.068 --> 05:25.048
Errrrrhhhh...

05:25.108 --> 05:26.888
Just admit you don't know
where we are.

05:26.948 --> 05:28.328
I would not admit that.

05:28.388 --> 05:29.688
Let's go home.

05:29.748 --> 05:31.848
No, we haven't had a new listing
in a while.

05:31.908 --> 05:33.608
It's becoming a safety issue.

05:33.668 --> 05:35.648
I'll give them a call
so they can give us directions.

05:35.708 --> 05:37.448
Did you bring a can and some string?

05:37.508 --> 05:39.208
What?
Hello? No reception.

05:39.268 --> 05:40.328
Oh, yeah.

05:40.388 --> 05:42.808
I'm turning around.
No, no, I-I can...I can get us...

05:42.868 --> 05:44.528
No, we're lost, we've no reception.

05:44.588 --> 05:46.688
I'm turning around and saving
our lives. You're welcome.

05:46.748 --> 05:48.568
No, no, just give me a second.
I can still...

05:50.668 --> 05:52.568

05:54.348 --> 05:55.768

05:59.028 --> 06:00.648
This is a disaster.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.408
It's not. I'll just change it
and then we can go.

06:02.468 --> 06:05.488
Oh, I don't know how to change
a tyre because I'm a woman?

06:05.548 --> 06:07.408
No, because you don't know
how to change a tyre.

06:07.468 --> 06:08.528
Lucky guess.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.408
You can get the spare out of the boot
if you like.

06:10.468 --> 06:12.208
It's empty.
Under that.

06:13.108 --> 06:15.728
I know that. I was kidding.
Gallows humour.

06:15.788 --> 06:17.288
That's not gallows humour.

06:17.348 --> 06:19.088
It is, because we're gonna die.

06:19.148 --> 06:22.088
Well, then all humour is gallows
humour, 'cause we're all gonna die.

06:25.988 --> 06:27.168
Shit.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.208
What's the point of having
a flat tyre in the boot?

06:29.268 --> 06:31.928
It's not supposed to be flat.
I...forgot to replace it.

06:32.948 --> 06:34.488
We are gonna die out here,
aren't we?

06:34.548 --> 06:36.208
Please stop saying that.
We can drive on a flat tyre.

06:36.268 --> 06:37.648
Until it disintegrates

06:37.708 --> 06:40.088
and hopefully the...sparks
don't light the car on fire.

06:40.148 --> 06:42.728
Are you serious? Hopefully no fire?
That's your plan?

06:42.788 --> 06:44.208
Well, it's very unlikely.

06:44.268 --> 06:46.488
We can call a tow truck
as soon as we get to the house.

it's about the journey"?

What if the journey sucks?

it wouldn't be very deep.

08:08.828 --> 08:10.288
Why don't I follow the road
for a while

08:10.348 --> 08:12.008
and see if I can find a driveway?

08:12.068 --> 08:13.608
Or we could stay with the car.

08:13.668 --> 08:15.208
Well, I was thinking
you could stay with the car

08:15.268 --> 08:17.888
in case someone drives past,
and I can look for help over there.

08:17.948 --> 08:19.088

you can't think of an example,

Nature?

09:05.468 --> 09:08.048
Why is it everywhere?
I think it's nice.

09:08.108 --> 09:09.448
Is this one of those situations

09:09.508 --> 09:11.768
where the only reason you're calm
is because I'm panicked,

09:11.828 --> 09:13.528
but secretly, you're also panicked?

09:13.588 --> 09:15.288
I'm a little worried
we'll miss the appraisal

09:15.348 --> 09:17.008
and my shoes are a bit muddy.

09:17.068 --> 09:18.528
But that's all?
Yeah.

09:18.588 --> 09:20.128
We're not in the jungle, Em.
This is Tassie.

09:20.188 --> 09:21.728
There are no animals out here
that can eat us.

09:21.788 --> 09:23.288
And we're on a road. We're fine.

09:23.348 --> 09:24.888
This would never happen
on the mainland.

09:24.948 --> 09:26.848
There'd be a taxi rank right there.

09:30.668 --> 09:32.048
Can you say something?

09:32.108 --> 09:34.448
All that's going around in my head
is, "It's quiet. TOO quiet.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.968
"It's quiet. TOO quiet,"
over and over. Distract me.

09:37.028 --> 09:38.928
With what?
Anything!

09:38.988 --> 09:41.128
That's a lot of pressure.
It's not. Just say something.

09:41.188 --> 09:43.288
You know, tell me a story.
Ask me a question.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.408
Well, you've given me a blank slate.
I don't know where to start.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.008
Come on!

09:47.068 --> 09:52.248
OK, um, imagine you're...
trapped in an elevator...

09:52.308 --> 09:54.408
..with...no shoes...

09:54.468 --> 09:57.368
OK, I'm gonna need you
to up your distraction game.

09:57.428 --> 09:58.768
I'm being serious now.

09:58.828 --> 10:01.568
We don't have any water,
it gets really cold at night,

10:01.628 --> 10:02.888
and it's gonna be dark soon.

10:02.948 --> 10:05.128
There is a chance
we don't get out of this.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.328
(SCOFFS) It's a really small chance.

10:07.388 --> 10:09.608
But there is a chance!

10:09.668 --> 10:12.008
Em, it's...it's, like, so close
to zero, it's zero.

10:12.068 --> 10:13.968
Like, the...the smallest
of smallest ch...

10:14.028 --> 10:15.448
It's minus zero chance
we don't get out.

10:15.508 --> 10:17.448
There are so many things
that I haven't eaten.

10:17.508 --> 10:18.848
That's what you're worried about?

10:18.908 --> 10:20.848
And I can't even give you
instructions for if I die,

10:20.908 --> 10:22.128
because you're gonna be dead too.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.368
Now you're really jumping ahead.

10:23.428 --> 10:24.968
Unless I die and you don't,
in which case I assume

10:25.028 --> 10:26.448
you'll kill yourself out of loyalty.

10:26.508 --> 10:29.008
I think you'd want me to live on.
I wouldn't.

10:29.068 --> 10:31.888
Well, you don't have to decide now.
I'm telling you now, I wouldn't.

10:34.028 --> 10:36.328
Mailbox. Which means
that's a driveway.

10:36.388 --> 10:39.008
So, no-one has to die.
We can eat everything we want.

10:39.068 --> 10:40.288
We're fine.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.208
That's a driveway?

10:42.268 --> 10:43.688
Hate to take the bins out.

10:44.788 --> 10:47.928
Or get the mail. Should have said
that first, 'cause of the mailbox.

10:47.988 --> 10:49.608
Do you want to...
Yep.

10:49.668 --> 10:51.128
OK.

10:51.188 --> 10:53.008
Still got a rock in your shoe?
Yep.

10:56.108 --> 10:57.968
See? I told you we'd be fine.

10:58.028 --> 11:00.808
We can use their phone, see if we can
get the appraisal moved till later.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.528
(LOUD CHOPPING)

11:06.428 --> 11:08.088
Hello?

11:08.148 --> 11:09.608
G'day.

11:09.668 --> 11:11.448
Did you hear us coming?
No.

11:11.508 --> 11:13.088
But you weren't surprised.

11:13.148 --> 11:14.208
You lost?

11:14.268 --> 11:15.488
No.
Yes.

11:15.548 --> 11:18.168
We definitely are lost.
We got stuck driving down the road.

11:18.228 --> 11:19.528
Can we use your phone?

11:19.588 --> 11:20.688
It's out.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.088
It's out?
Yeah.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.968
The line's fine. Just, one of
the dogs chewed the handset.

11:25.028 --> 11:26.648
I never got round to replacing it.

11:26.708 --> 11:29.968
Um, you don't have, like,
an emergency radio?

11:30.028 --> 11:31.288
Wi-Fi?

11:31.348 --> 11:32.568
What's the problem?

11:32.628 --> 11:35.248
Oh, mate, just hit
a really muddy patch of road, mate,

11:35.308 --> 11:36.808
and, uh, got her bogged.

11:36.868 --> 11:38.088
Yeah, she wouldn't budge, mate.

11:38.148 --> 11:39.528
She was drivin'.

11:39.588 --> 11:41.608
We also have a flat tyre. His fault.

11:41.668 --> 11:42.968
Double trouble.

11:43.028 --> 11:45.088
Yeah, mate, yeah. It's, um...
Why are you saying 'mate' so much?

11:45.148 --> 11:47.848
Well, I can come down, have a look.
We should be able to get you out.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.328
Yes! Uh, thank you.

11:50.388 --> 11:52.608
Um, I'm Emma, by the way.
Daniel.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.128
Yes?
What?

11:54.188 --> 11:55.888
No way!
What?

11:55.948 --> 11:57.248
Is your name Daniel?
Yeah.

11:57.308 --> 11:58.488
Like you!
What?

11:58.548 --> 12:00.528
His name is Daniel.
Hi.

12:00.588 --> 12:01.768
That's amazing.

12:01.828 --> 12:03.288
Well, not really.
It's a pretty common name.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.168
Do people ever call you Danny?
No.

12:05.228 --> 12:10.328
Um...are there any neighbours around
whose phone we could use, or...?

12:10.388 --> 12:12.408
I mean, you wouldn't even see
the postman,

12:12.468 --> 12:14.488
'cause your mailbox is so far away.

12:14.548 --> 12:16.848
Not wrong about that.
Where'd you travel from?

12:16.908 --> 12:18.768
Rosehaven.
(CHUCKLES) Rosehaven?

12:18.828 --> 12:20.448
Jeez, you ARE lost, aren't you?

12:20.508 --> 12:23.088
I mean, we've got to still be
in Tasmania, right?

12:23.148 --> 12:25.808
So, it's just...it's just you here?

12:25.868 --> 12:26.928
Yeah.

12:26.988 --> 12:29.528
You can go wait inside if you want.
I'll just finish up here.

12:29.588 --> 12:31.088
Do you ever cut yourself?

12:31.148 --> 12:32.888
What, with this?

12:32.948 --> 12:35.168
Wouldn't be standing here
looking at you if I did.

12:35.228 --> 12:37.048
Sharp as a fox's wit, this thing.

12:37.108 --> 12:39.928
Yeah. They're sharp.

12:39.988 --> 12:41.368
Come on, mate.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.128
You were right.

12:49.188 --> 12:51.008
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:51.068 --> 12:54.528
OK, this is gonna sound crazy,
but just don't get too comfortable.

12:54.588 --> 12:55.648
What?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.608
Well, we're in the middle of nowhere
and there's a guy there

12:57.668 --> 12:59.328
who I don't think either of us
could beat in a fight.

12:59.388 --> 13:00.768
Speak for yourself.

13:00.828 --> 13:01.808
Well, he has an axe.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.488
Hard to chop wood without one.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.128
Yeah, and he says
his phone isn't working?

13:05.188 --> 13:07.248
Your phone isn't working.
I just want us to be careful.

13:08.148 --> 13:10.528
I like him.
Well, course you do.

13:10.588 --> 13:12.328
What is that supposed to mean?

13:12.388 --> 13:14.328
Well, I mean, he's a...
What?

13:14.388 --> 13:16.528
He's a strong, rugged, manly man.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.968
Is he?
Yeah, he's like a hot lumberjack.

13:19.028 --> 13:20.808
He's not my type.
Yes, he is.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.088
He isn't.
He's everyone's type!

13:22.148 --> 13:23.488
It...it doesn't matter.

13:23.548 --> 13:26.088
If he offers us any food or drink,
we just say, "No, thank you."

13:26.148 --> 13:27.208
I'm really thirsty.

13:27.268 --> 13:28.528
He could spike our drinks.

13:28.588 --> 13:30.088
You've watched
too many horror movies.

13:30.148 --> 13:31.328
Yeah, that's how I know this stuff.

13:31.388 --> 13:32.848
I was kidding.
You don't watch horror movies.

13:32.908 --> 13:33.888
They're too scary for you.

13:33.948 --> 13:35.888
No, no, I watch 'em all the time
now I live with Grace.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.008
She's there when I go to bed,
so I don't get scared anymore.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.968
She's like a human night-light.
That's so sweet.

13:40.028 --> 13:40.968
Yeah, thanks.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.408
So, if he pours us a drink
out of the tap

13:42.468 --> 13:43.768
and we see him pour it, that's fine,

13:43.828 --> 13:45.208
but if he gets us a drink
out of the fridge

13:45.268 --> 13:47.808
or he hides pouring the drinks
from us, we don't drink it.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.848
So if he brings us two glasses
of water, we just stare at them?

13:50.908 --> 13:52.128
Well, we say we're not thirsty.

13:56.348 --> 13:57.928
Thanks, mate. We're not thirsty.

14:04.908 --> 14:06.368
So, you've got a flat tyre?

14:06.428 --> 14:07.808
Two.
Two?

14:07.868 --> 14:09.288
Daniel's spare is also flat.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.848
AND you're bogged?
Correct.

14:10.908 --> 14:12.648
He thought it was quicksand.
Right.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.928
Well, you've got
a couple of options.

14:14.988 --> 14:19.528
Could be a tow job, winch,
or we could snatch you out of there.

14:19.588 --> 14:20.888
Snatch us out?

14:20.948 --> 14:23.168
Snatch strap.
What's that?

14:23.228 --> 14:24.368
Oh, it's a, uh...

14:25.668 --> 14:27.048
Sorry, you were saying?

14:27.108 --> 14:30.048
It's, uh, an elastic strap.
It'll sling you out.

14:30.108 --> 14:32.688
Lay down a couple of tracks too,
depending on how deep you are.

14:32.748 --> 14:33.928
I'll bring a shovel.

14:33.988 --> 14:35.488
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

14:35.548 --> 14:36.928
Sounds good.

14:36.988 --> 14:39.088
Righto. We'll head down
and have a look.

14:39.148 --> 14:40.768
I'll grab some tools
and I'll meet you at the ute.

14:40.828 --> 14:42.488
Great. Thanks, mate.
Thanks.

14:44.268 --> 14:45.848
Stop drinking it!

14:47.668 --> 14:49.928
You can carry me
if I've been poisoned.

14:49.988 --> 14:51.848
There's no point
both of us being thirsty.

14:53.668 --> 14:55.648
(EMMA GIGGLES)

14:57.988 --> 14:59.488
Whee!

14:59.548 --> 15:01.008
Can you at least
hold on to something?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.168
I'm gonna stand up!
Don't stand up.

15:03.228 --> 15:04.968
Aren't you having fun?!

15:05.028 --> 15:08.208
I'm having a small amount of fun
while still keeping my guard up.

15:08.268 --> 15:10.368
Do you really think
if he was gonna murder us

15:10.428 --> 15:12.728
he would take us on an awesome ride
on the back of his ute?

15:12.788 --> 15:14.968
Well, the ride to the slaughterhouse
is probably fun for the cows.

15:15.028 --> 15:16.248
What?

15:16.308 --> 15:18.968
I'm just saying, we don't know
this guy, no-one knows where we are,

15:19.028 --> 15:21.208
and now we're on the back of his ute
and you drank his poisoned water.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.408
It's not poison. I feel f...

15:23.468 --> 15:25.128
I feel f...

15:25.188 --> 15:26.848
That's not funny.

15:26.908 --> 15:29.288
Have you always been
this scared of strangers?

15:29.348 --> 15:30.768
How do you do inspections?

15:30.828 --> 15:33.248
Well, if a tenant kidnapped me,
I'd have a key to get out.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.888
If I got kidnapped, how much ransom
would you pay to have me released?

15:36.948 --> 15:38.608
I guess whatever's
in my bank account.

15:38.668 --> 15:41.208
What if they said,
"We want a million dollars now"?

15:41.268 --> 15:42.808
I'd say, "Put Emma on the phone,"

15:42.868 --> 15:45.168
and then I'd say, "Hey, mate.
Just wanted to say goodbye."

15:49.668 --> 15:51.208
There's the car.

15:51.268 --> 15:52.848
See? He's gonna help us.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.448
Or, now he knows where our car is,

15:54.508 --> 15:56.568
he's gonna remove any evidence
that we were ever here.

15:56.628 --> 15:58.888
How many horror films
have you watched lately?

15:58.948 --> 16:00.048

30?!

16:23.228 --> 16:25.408
You did it! That was so cool.

16:25.468 --> 16:27.288
I've got a spare tyre.

16:27.348 --> 16:30.448

you know, take it easy going back.

No showing off, leadfoot.

16:32.068 --> 16:33.808
I'll try. Thanks, mate.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.288
What are you doing out here, anyway?
Oh, we're real estate agents.

16:36.348 --> 16:37.928
We were doing an appraisal
and we got lost.

16:37.988 --> 16:39.368
Oh.

16:39.428 --> 16:41.608
Well, there's not a lot of houses
around here. Where are you headed?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.968
Oh, j...
3455 Ridgeblade Road?

16:44.028 --> 16:46.248
Wedge Nest.
Wedge what?

16:46.308 --> 16:48.408
Well, it's easier to go by the house
names out here than numbers.

16:48.468 --> 16:50.568
Wedge Nest - that's the only one
I can think of in Ridgeblade.

16:50.628 --> 16:52.368
Bill's house.
That's his name!

16:52.428 --> 16:53.648
It's not far.
I can run you up there.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.008
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that, mate.

16:55.068 --> 16:57.208
Just point us in the right direction
and we'll get out of your hair.

16:57.268 --> 16:59.048
No, no. You can follow me.
Only take a couple of seconds.

16:59.108 --> 17:01.288
The roads are confusing
if you don't know 'em.

17:01.348 --> 17:04.848
That is so lovely and helpful
and kind of you, Dan.

17:04.908 --> 17:06.888
Isn't it, Dan?
Yes.

17:06.948 --> 17:09.008
Righto.
Thank you.

17:09.068 --> 17:10.888

17:27.108 --> 17:30.128
See? Safely to our destination.

17:30.188 --> 17:33.528
OK, there is a small, unlikely thing
I'd like you to consider.

There's a tree swing!
Sorry, what did you say?

17:36.108 --> 17:38.488
At the risk of sounding paranoid...
Too late.

17:38.548 --> 17:42.288
..there is a small possibility
that Dan is Bill.

17:42.348 --> 17:43.688
What?!

17:43.748 --> 17:46.688
Pretending to be a farmer
when really, he's another farmer?

17:46.748 --> 17:48.008
We never met Bill.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.368
Dan could have lured us here
to, I don't know...

17:50.428 --> 17:51.528
Do a murder on us.

17:51.588 --> 17:54.248
I'm just saying, why didn't he
just drop us off and go?

17:54.308 --> 17:57.928
He's still here,
or Bill and him are in it together.

17:57.988 --> 17:59.088
I mean, that's kind of nice.

17:59.148 --> 18:00.888
You know, best friends
sharing a common interest.

18:00.948 --> 18:02.288
"Would you like to murder
this one, Bill?"

18:02.348 --> 18:04.288
"Oh, no, Dan. Please, after you."
I know it sounds crazy.

18:04.348 --> 18:06.928
I would just like us to have
some sort of phrase or signal

18:06.988 --> 18:08.768
that means, "Run back to the car."

18:08.828 --> 18:11.088
OK, the phrase is,

18:11.148 --> 18:13.328
"I'm Daniel. I don't understand
that horror films aren't real."

18:13.388 --> 18:14.688
Yeah, well, that's too long,

18:14.748 --> 18:17.288
and most of the ones set in rural
Australia are based on true events.

18:20.948 --> 18:23.368
(KNOCKS)

18:25.828 --> 18:28.408
(CONTINUES KNOCKING)

18:28.468 --> 18:30.208
Doesn't look like he's home.

18:30.268 --> 18:32.528
Oh, well, we were running
pretty late, so...

18:32.588 --> 18:33.848
Oh. She's open.

18:35.028 --> 18:36.888
(CALLS OUT) Hey, Bill? You home?

18:38.228 --> 18:39.688
Hello, Bill?

18:55.748 --> 18:57.528
Thought he was about.

18:57.588 --> 18:59.488
Must have been hearing things.

18:59.548 --> 19:00.928
Yeah, well, we've probably
missed him.

19:00.988 --> 19:03.568
We'll...we'll head back to the office
and call him from there.

19:03.628 --> 19:05.728
Emma, he might be round the back
if you want to have a look.

19:05.788 --> 19:07.008
Sure.

19:07.068 --> 19:08.288
I'll come with you.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.768
Daniel, can I borrow you
for a minute?

19:11.028 --> 19:15.328
Uh...yeah, I've actually got to go
to the bathroom, sorry, mate.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.568
So, we should head back.

19:16.628 --> 19:19.328
Well, the dunny's through there. I'm
sure Bill won't mind you using it.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.448
OK. Great.

19:23.668 --> 19:25.008
Off I go.

19:31.428 --> 19:32.968
(TURNS OFF TAP)

19:36.668 --> 19:38.608
(DOOR OPENS)

19:41.668 --> 19:43.008
Hi.

19:43.068 --> 19:45.008
How'd you go?

19:45.068 --> 19:46.568
In the toilet?

19:47.708 --> 19:49.488
Good...

19:49.548 --> 19:51.528
I've been trying to get you
one on one.

19:51.588 --> 19:54.768
Sure. Just for a...
just for a chat in the bathroom.

19:55.748 --> 19:57.488
That's...that's normal.

19:57.548 --> 20:00.648
Thing is, I kind of
tuck myself away out here.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.888
Don't really get to meet
new people that often.

20:04.108 --> 20:06.408
Now that I have, I don't want
to miss an opportunity...

20:06.468 --> 20:07.888
I am, uh...I'm sorry to interrupt.

20:07.948 --> 20:12.288
Um...I've just been doing
the appraisal and, um...

20:12.348 --> 20:14.528
..d-d-does this look like
water damage to you?

20:15.668 --> 20:17.408
Is that...

20:17.468 --> 20:18.888
It's hard to tell...

20:19.748 --> 20:21.288
(TOWEL RAIL CLATTERS)

20:21.348 --> 20:22.288
Em!

20:22.348 --> 20:24.448
(CRASH!)
Oh! Not again. Em!

20:31.268 --> 20:32.688
Oh, my gosh! Em!

20:32.748 --> 20:34.728
What? I'm flying!

20:34.788 --> 20:36.408
Oh! We have to go NOW!

20:36.468 --> 20:38.328
What? Wait!
(CAR APPROACHES)

20:38.388 --> 20:39.408
He's got backup!

20:44.668 --> 20:47.008
Hey! Are you from the real estate?!

20:47.068 --> 20:48.528
Yeah!

20:48.588 --> 20:50.448
Are you Bill?
Yep.

20:50.508 --> 20:52.128
And you're five hours late.

20:52.188 --> 20:54.888
I assumed you weren't coming,
so I went fishing.

20:57.228 --> 20:59.128
Oh, g'day, Dan.
Bill.

21:00.148 --> 21:01.688
Who knocked over my stuff?!

21:05.028 --> 21:07.888
So you thought that
I was gonna kill you?

21:07.948 --> 21:09.168
No.

21:09.228 --> 21:11.208
Maybe.

21:11.268 --> 21:13.688
Probably would have been easier
to do it back at mine.

21:13.748 --> 21:15.208
I could have spiked your drinks.

21:16.228 --> 21:17.768
Do I seem scary?

21:17.828 --> 21:19.408
No.
Yes. No.

21:19.468 --> 21:21.608
Well, maybe I need to come
into town a bit more.

21:21.668 --> 21:23.688
Never used to have people think
I was gonna murder 'em!

21:23.748 --> 21:27.088
It's not you, Dan. It's him, Dan.
Very suspicious.

21:27.148 --> 21:28.928
Spent too much time
on the mainland, I reckon.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.888
Doesn't understand the country life
like we do.

21:30.948 --> 21:32.688
Bill, I am so sorry about all this.

21:32.748 --> 21:33.928
Should you decide to list with us,

21:33.988 --> 21:36.928
we could definitely negotiate
a much lower commission.

21:36.988 --> 21:38.448
As if I'd list with you!

21:38.508 --> 21:40.688
You kicked over my towel rack.
And my plant.

21:40.748 --> 21:42.008
And I will never do it again.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.608
I just got that bloody ficus.

21:43.668 --> 21:46.728
Bill, I've seen what these two
have been through to get here.

21:46.788 --> 21:48.408
Two flat tyres...
Two?

21:48.468 --> 21:50.088
Daniel has a spare flat tyre
in the boot.

21:50.148 --> 21:52.288
She was driving.
Then they got bogged.

21:52.348 --> 21:55.088
Then they had to walk to my place,
and they still made it here.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.088
For what it's worth,
I reckon they're alright.

21:57.148 --> 21:58.368
Thanks, mate.

21:59.868 --> 22:02.528
80% off your commission.
Mate's rates.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.568
Well, we'd be paid almost nothing...
Deal.

22:08.508 --> 22:11.968
Sorry about scaring you before
in the bathroom, mate.

22:12.028 --> 22:14.128
What I did want to ask you
privately before you took off

22:14.188 --> 22:15.768
was if Emma was single.

22:15.828 --> 22:16.928
Me?

22:17.988 --> 22:20.848
You are not good at whispering.
I'm a bit out of practice.

22:21.828 --> 22:23.928
Does Rosehaven still have that pub?

22:23.988 --> 22:27.128
Pub? Um...I think it does.

22:27.188 --> 22:29.528
Well, I could take you down there
in me ute.

22:29.588 --> 22:32.288
Or I could meet you down there.

22:32.348 --> 22:34.488
Or we could go for a walk
along the fence line.

22:34.548 --> 22:36.728
Go spotlighting.
What's that?

22:36.788 --> 22:39.528
Night walk looking for possums.
Thought so.

22:39.588 --> 22:44.288
Uh, all lovely options,
and I am single, and I am flattered,

22:44.348 --> 22:46.408
but, uh, no, thank you, for a date.

22:46.468 --> 22:48.568
Thanks anyway.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.408
No harm, no foul. Had to ask.

22:53.308 --> 22:55.048
Thanks for everything, mate.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.768
No worries. I'll kill you next time.

22:57.828 --> 22:59.208
(CHUCKLES)

22:59.268 --> 23:01.768
If you could add "just kidding", that
would really help me sleep at night.

23:12.228 --> 23:13.848
So you really don't want to date him?

23:13.908 --> 23:16.088
Nope! Ha! Suck it!

23:16.148 --> 23:17.528
I told you he wasn't my type,

23:17.588 --> 23:19.688
and in your head you were like,
"Yeah, right, he's not her type."

23:19.748 --> 23:22.048
Well, guess what?
Yeah, right, he's not.

23:22.108 --> 23:24.048
Got me.
It is a bit of a shame.

23:24.108 --> 23:26.568
Imagine how good your best man
speech would be if I married him.

23:26.628 --> 23:28.808
"When I first met Dan,
I thought he was gonna murder me,

23:28.868 --> 23:31.408
"so I knocked over a plant
and soiled myself..."

23:31.468 --> 23:32.848
No, I didn't soil myself.

23:32.908 --> 23:34.528
You got soil on yourself,
so you soiled yourself.

23:34.588 --> 23:36.208
And you shit your pants.

23:36.268 --> 23:38.088
I'm glad you're having fun now.
I am.

23:38.148 --> 23:40.008
Do you still miss
three-storey buildings?

23:40.068 --> 23:41.128
Nope.

23:41.188 --> 23:43.048
Although, I am a bit sad
I didn't get a photo of him

23:43.108 --> 23:44.728
so I could show people
who asked me out.

23:44.788 --> 23:46.928
Oh, well, you can get a photo
when you return his spare tyre.

23:46.988 --> 23:50.008
No, I rejected him. That'd be
awkward. You have to take it back.

23:50.068 --> 23:52.328
Well, you can come with me.
Are you still scared, mate?

23:52.388 --> 23:54.808
Mate, you're still bloody scared,
ya drongo. Oh, mate, you...

23:54.868 --> 23:56.288
You know he never said
"just kidding"?

23:56.348 --> 23:57.768
He just smiled and walked off.

23:57.828 --> 23:59.728
Oh, you're right. He didn't, did he?
Oh, don't do that.

23:59.788 --> 24:02.408
And he knows where you work.
You're the one who broke his heart.

24:02.468 --> 24:04.888
No, I'm serious. I think he might
actually be coming for you.

24:04.948 --> 24:06.648
Oh...
Did you check the boot when we left?

24:06.708 --> 24:09.208
Did you hear that thudding?
He'd be more angry at you than me.

24:09.268 --> 24:10.968
He's left a hook in the car!
I didn't reject him...

24:11.028 --> 24:12.528
Daniel, there's a hook
on the side of the car!

24:12.588 --> 24:13.768
Very funny.

24:20.468 --> 24:23.328
Just go! With your health!
You don't care.

24:23.388 --> 24:25.048
I do care, just from a distance.

24:25.108 --> 24:26.928
How are you feeling
about the open home today?

24:26.988 --> 24:29.248
I can handle it.
You won't have Emma to help.

24:29.308 --> 24:31.048
Everyone, just make sure
you give me your contact info

24:31.108 --> 24:32.328
so I can update you
about the property.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.328
My fish is gone.

24:33.388 --> 24:34.808
Well, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

24:34.868 --> 24:36.808
A fish got stolen
from the open home today.

24:36.868 --> 24:39.008
Do you know who did it?
Was it a cat?

24:39.068 --> 24:40.208
You're the fish thief.

24:43.468 --> 24:45.408
Very few locals know about it,

24:45.468 --> 24:48.768
but this tree, when you come here
at a certain time,

24:48.828 --> 24:54.288
Rosehaven's oldest bat will come
and sit on your shoulder...

24:54.348 --> 24:55.608
..and sing...

24:55.668 --> 24:57.808
There is no secret
Rosehaven activity, is there?

24:57.868 --> 24:59.528
No, I was hoping
you'd forget I said it.
