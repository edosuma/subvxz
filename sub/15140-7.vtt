00:00.167 --> 00:02.127
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.211 --> 00:05.172
[man] Mr. Speaker,
the president of the United States!

00:05.255 --> 00:07.674
[Rod] You have a country
of people who believe in you.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.843
Templeton is not choosing
my vice president.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.054
- She picked somebody.
- It's Warren Keaton.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.283
If you want a man
who's worth a damn in this job,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.391
you gotta make this job worth a damn.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.061
He won't be confirmed.
Not with what I know.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.522
Do yourself a favor, Rod.
Stay in your lane.

00:21.605 --> 00:24.525
- If I've got an idea...
- You have her ear at bedside.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.944
We want you as the next
commissioner of baseball.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.655
No first person has ever worked
outside the White House.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.324
There's no legal reason
I can't take that job.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.409
You might be happier.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.829
She really is all over you. How's a guy
supposed to kiss you good night?

00:37.913 --> 00:40.415
- Aren't you the president's daughter?
- Get off me!

00:40.499 --> 00:42.251
So you're just gonna take this job?

00:42.334 --> 00:44.336
Can you make me a better offer?

00:45.879 --> 00:48.215
[police siren in distance]

00:49.633 --> 00:50.968
[footsteps approaching]

00:51.885 --> 00:53.136
[Rod] You're up early.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.222
- Yeah. Went for a run.
- Mmm.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.016
I couldn't sleep. I keep thinking
about the hearings.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.393
It's a big day, all right.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.228
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.981
Gonna tour the Baseball Commission
this morning?

01:04.064 --> 01:07.317
They want to make a big deal
out of the contract signing.

01:07.401 --> 01:11.738
Well, there hasn't been a new baseball
commissioner in a decade now.

01:11.822 --> 01:15.117
So... how's this gonna work?

01:15.200 --> 01:17.661
You're gonna be spending
a lot of time in New York?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.247
Well, there's gonna be, uh, long days.

01:20.330 --> 01:23.208
Some overnights, some travel.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.546
- I guess we should sit the kids down.
- Yeah.

01:27.629 --> 01:31.592
Amy, especially. I mean, she's used
to having both of us around full-time.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.011
- Yeah.
- Madam President, Mr. Calloway,

01:34.094 --> 01:37.097
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I got an advance copy.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.766
- Of what?
- The new Evan Hutchins book.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.060
That wasn't supposed
to come out for two days.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.229
A friend works
at the publishing house.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.733
It's pretty rough, ma'am.
The epilogue, it... [sighs]

01:47.816 --> 01:48.984
It's rough.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.194
They changed the title.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.531
Oh, my God.
How much of this have you read?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.491
Only what my friend alerted me to read.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.785
Advance copies aren't out
for a couple of days,

01:58.869 --> 02:00.871
so I think we can get
ahead of this story.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.956
Kelly, I'll see you later.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.917
Have a great trip.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.212
Mac, this is a big deal.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.591
I have a vice president to confirm,
my first executive order to sign

02:12.674 --> 02:15.344
and a country to run.
Those are big deals. That's a book.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.804
- By Evan Hutchins.
- Right. By Evan Hutchins.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.186
- All right, tell me the worst of it.
- Page 337, in the epilogue.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.147
- What the press will latch on to.
- So will Templeton.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.231
[Kelly sighs]

02:28.315 --> 02:29.816
On the day of the hearings.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.943
- [slams book shut]
- Damn it!

02:32.027 --> 02:34.196
Obviously, there's someone
close to us

02:34.279 --> 02:36.239
who should not be close to us.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.660
All right, let's get senior staff
assembled as quickly as possible.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.662
Thought you were going to New York.

02:41.745 --> 02:44.831
Evan Hutchins is not going
to bring down this administration.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.503
I thought Hutchins was writing
a Bridges bio, not a Mac smear job.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.004
Focus shifted after he died.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.673
- Into attack mode.
- Yeah,

02:52.756 --> 02:56.385
thanks to
"senior White House officials."

02:56.468 --> 02:58.595
Kelly, what's this
about you getting caught

02:58.679 --> 03:01.264
making out with George Clooney
at the inauguration?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.267
Eli, focus. We have to get
on serious damage control mode here.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.395
We can't have her painted
as out of the loop.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.356
- Disloyal?
- [Rod] Morning, everyone.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.274
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.610
- Everything OK, Thad?
- Uh, yes, sir.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.363
That's good.
Everyone's seen the book?

03:16.446 --> 03:17.614
Piece of garbage, sir.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.492
Well, despite that, we have
to preempt it as best we can.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.078
We have 48 hours until it goes public.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.331
Let's start divvying up chapters
and documenting inaccuracies.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.375
- Already on it.
- Anything that can be used

03:28.458 --> 03:30.711
to challenge
Hutchins' credibility, do it.

03:30.794 --> 03:34.089
Hard to slam Evan Hutchins.
He already has two Pulitzers.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.174
Watch me.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.599
You'll be second to the last
in the rotation of the questioners.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.394
You'll have ten minutes, no more,
so get to it quickly.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.814
- Who else knows about this?
- Keaton told me about five years ago.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.608
It was... We were close friends.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.528
I think I'm the only guy
he ever unloaded to.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.156
Yeah, Willy's an old compadre
of the general's.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.867
Which is why I know he can't be
vice president.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.162
Look, if you even hint at this,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.497
Keaton's a hothead, he'll walk away.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.000
He'll hit the lecture circuit.
He'll write a book.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.626
He'll forget about being VP.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.712
Bloody hell, guys.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.131
Teddy Bridges is dead.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.259
We forgot how fragile life is.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.096
We forgot that the vice presidency
is not an irrelevancy.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.514
[chuckles]

04:24.598 --> 04:27.225
Thank God we got the power
of the 25th Amendment,

04:27.309 --> 04:29.311
that's all I can say.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.356
- Ma'am.
- Jim, good.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.567
- Ready for today?
- Your husband, ma'am.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.779
He's in the Roosevelt Room
running a meeting of some kind.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.655
He stayed, huh?

04:40.739 --> 04:43.241
He was supposed to begin
his new job today.

04:43.325 --> 04:47.287
Well, he's here, and...
Look, Kelly filled me in on the book.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.623
If you want to combat it
don't you think I...?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.166
No, Jim, I don't.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.502
Listen, Rod is just protecting me.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.462
That's what he does. I can't stop him.

04:55.545 --> 04:58.840
What we need to focus on is
monitoring these confirmation hearings.

04:58.924 --> 05:01.259
We have this executive order
to consider.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.137
You know it's been impossible
to set any sort of agenda

05:04.221 --> 05:06.556
when there's constantly
a fire to put out.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.684
Ma'am, you assumed office
at a tragic time.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.438
Job one was holding the country
together, and you've done that.

05:13.522 --> 05:17.067
We can get fully into the Allen agenda
once Keaton is confirmed.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.236
Right. Well,

05:19.319 --> 05:22.364
I'm certainly not gonna let
a journalist derail our work.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.490
OK, ma'am.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.618
In any case, Kelly says the book
is still a couple of days out.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.830
Any inaccuracies in it
can be dealt with ahead of time.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.834
Rod will find 'em all, trust me.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.963
- [man on radio] Velour's in the quad.
- I can't believe it, another new agent.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.590
Man, who knew Greer was so cool.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.050
It sucks that I got her fired.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.594
No, you didn't. Your dad just sorta...

05:45.262 --> 05:47.931
Overreacted? He's a dad, you know.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.183
Yeah. I know we're never gonna be alone.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.854
Why don't you come to the residence?
Secret Service doesn't go upstairs.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.065
Yeah, your mom was real happy
when she caught me there last time.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.318
What about your house?

06:00.402 --> 06:03.113
- Can you pull it off?
- Probably not.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.824
Well, maybe if there were
other kids there, you know.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.993
I could have a party.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.953
Oh, your parents
would have to be home.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.872
I'm at my dad's this weekend.
He's cool.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.249
[bell rings]

06:14.332 --> 06:15.834
Huh?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.128
- OK.
- You're a genius.

06:19.462 --> 06:23.383
President Allen will carefully follow
General Keaton's confirmation hearings

06:23.466 --> 06:25.969
- at the House.
- [reporters clamoring]

06:26.052 --> 06:29.222
Is it true the hearings will be
the first C-SPAN program

06:29.306 --> 06:31.683
to be blocked by the V-chip
for coarse language?

06:31.766 --> 06:33.226
[chuckling]

06:33.310 --> 06:37.606
Kelly, does the president have
any comment on Evan Hutchins' book?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.026
- I'm sorry?
- Specifically the charge he makes

06:41.109 --> 06:43.153
that, on his deathbed,
President Bridges

06:43.236 --> 06:45.488
asked Mackenzie Allen to resign

06:45.572 --> 06:47.866
rather than assume the presidency.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.131
[man] What was most frustrating
to the Bridges team was

07:03.214 --> 07:06.343
Mackenzie Allen putting
her principles over party loyalty.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.512
- I can't hear myself think.
- At a meeting with donors who raised

07:09.596 --> 07:12.015
- over $250,000 in...
- [mutes sound]

07:12.098 --> 07:13.433
You can't ignore this, Mac.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.685
If the country feels
you betrayed his wishes

07:15.769 --> 07:17.520
they'll view you as illegitimate.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.689
They'll view me
as even more illegitimate

07:19.773 --> 07:21.358
if I don't do my job as president.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.777
I am determined to sign
my first executive order,

07:23.860 --> 07:26.821
and I want it to be
the Richmond education initiative.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.281
- Good.
- Jim is pushing me

07:28.365 --> 07:30.367
to sign Bridges' space initiative.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.661
He thinks it will be
a nice tribute to Teddy.

07:32.744 --> 07:38.500
Mac, are you getting this? This book
is symptomatic of a bigger problem.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.962
A lot of these details only
a very few people have access to.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.173
We have a dangerous, dangerous leak.

07:46.549 --> 07:50.178
- Jim was first to ask you to resign.
- Melanie was there next to him.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.973
The entire cabinet was aware
of what Bridges was asking.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.351
- Jim was outside that hospital door.
- Look, Jim's hardheaded,

07:56.434 --> 08:00.230
but something like this, it's
completely outside of his character.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.564
I'm not buying it.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.610
- You need to read this, Mac.
- Why?

08:05.694 --> 08:07.862
Because there is chapter after chapter

08:07.946 --> 08:10.323
of how Bridges wanted you out.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.659
How he didn't trust your instincts.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.204
You need to know what Bridges
really thought of you.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.374
Once you do that,
you can break the chain to him.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.837
[knock on door]

08:25.964 --> 08:27.382
Jim.

08:27.465 --> 08:31.011
- Madam President, the Keatons are here.
- Oh. Thank you.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.141
Abigail. Hey, Hunter.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.892
- Madam President.
- Warren.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.853
- General. Good to see you.
- Hello, Rod.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.312
Remember Abigail and Hunter?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.064
What do you think
of the White House?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.608
- Looks bigger in Independence Day.
- [chuckling]

08:45.692 --> 08:48.695
Jim, give the General the news
out of Gallup. This is great.

08:48.894 --> 08:51.364
- Seventy-thirty, fave-unfave.
- In other words,

08:51.448 --> 08:54.451
I'll soon give you the scoop
on the vice presidential mansion.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.703
- In all your spare time.
- [knock on door]

08:56.786 --> 08:58.455
General, we need to leave.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.707
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.919
They're giving me a microphone today.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.504
I can say whatever you need.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.758
Tell 'em to go to hell in a flatbed
truck if they believe that book...

09:09.841 --> 09:13.928
- General...
- I'll behave, Jim.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.388
Unless you don't want me to.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.474
Go kick some tail.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.101
Just like you did
in the Senate, Warren.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.314
Ma'am, I've scheduled some time
for a presentation by NASA

09:24.397 --> 09:27.650
on the Mars initiative. I think
it could be a hell of a first EO.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.321
OK. Well, I certainly will listen
to what they have to say.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.115
Any thoughts on that book, Jim?

09:35.283 --> 09:36.659
I haven't read it yet.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.787
Not sure if I'm going to.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.166
It's 'cause he knows what's in it.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.129
Hey, Vince.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.174
How many did you get?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.967
What are you talking about?

09:53.051 --> 09:54.844
Entries in the index.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.013
Did you come here to give me
a hard time?

09:57.097 --> 10:00.100
Your lucky number came up.
Random drug screening today.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.601
Sign here.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.648
[sighs] Lucky me.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.202
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.121
The hearings are about to begin.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.836
I am proud to chair this hearing

10:27.919 --> 10:30.547
that celebrates the 25th Amendment.

10:30.630 --> 10:35.009
This is only the third time that
such a hearing has taken place.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.823
- General, we welcome you.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.308
Will you please stand for
the administration of the oath?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.689
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony

10:47.772 --> 10:50.275
that you will give before
this confirmation committee

10:50.567 --> 10:52.902
will be the truth, the whole truth

10:52.986 --> 10:55.155
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

10:55.238 --> 10:56.656
I do so affirm.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.369
Well, this should be painless.
Sit, please.

11:03.788 --> 11:07.041
Some of you were less interested
in analyzing Mr. Sinclair's book

11:07.125 --> 11:11.045
than in regurgitating its contents.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.881
I've read The Jungle, guys.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.300
- I know what happens.
- [school bell rings]

11:16.467 --> 11:18.720
[cell phone beeps]

11:21.598 --> 11:22.932
Horace.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.895
About your essay...

11:26.978 --> 11:29.397
Yeah, I guess I kinda waited
till the last minute.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.316
It's not like it's the first time.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.319
Look, you're gonna have to get
that one signed by a parent.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.654
- Seriously?
- And I need a rewrite by Monday.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.616
OK.

11:39.699 --> 11:43.077
I noticed you signed up to meet with
the Annapolis reps on college night.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.120
Yeah.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.081
Any private college would love
to have the president's kid.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.543
Annapolis, on top of being the toughest
school in the nation to get into,

11:50.627 --> 11:53.296
- is funded by the government.
- I'm sorry?

11:53.379 --> 11:57.342
You picked the only school you can't
just skate into based on who you are.

11:57.425 --> 12:00.261
Or rather, who your mother is.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.099
General, how vital is it
for a vice president

12:05.183 --> 12:07.268
to be loyal to the president?

12:07.352 --> 12:10.230
Well, there are many definitions
of loyalty, Mr. Chairman.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.816
But personally, I always took it
as a mark of loyalty

12:13.900 --> 12:17.320
when the officers under my command
gave me their honest opinion.

12:17.403 --> 12:20.156
But you never expected them
to disagree with you in public

12:20.240 --> 12:23.743
- or in the line of duty?
- That would be safe to say, sir.

12:23.826 --> 12:24.911
I bet.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.372
You'd expect them to obey an order,

12:27.455 --> 12:30.458
- once given, to the letter. Yes?
- Without fail.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.462
So, what is your opinion of
then-Vice President Mackenzie Allen's

12:34.545 --> 12:37.131
alleged refusal to obey a direct order

12:37.215 --> 12:39.926
from her president to resign?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.763
Well, without firsthand information

12:43.846 --> 12:46.516
I'm hardly qualified to comment, am I?

12:47.892 --> 12:52.397
Still, um, it's hard not to think
if... if she had stepped down,

12:52.480 --> 12:54.816
let's see, uh,

12:54.899 --> 12:57.860
the next in line would've been, uh...

12:57.944 --> 13:00.530
- [crowd laughing]
- The name escapes me.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.865
[applause]

13:04.784 --> 13:08.496
How about this comment
from the vice presidential debates?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.999
You said, and I quote,

13:11.082 --> 13:14.377
"Mackenzie Allen was chosen

13:14.460 --> 13:19.465
because Teddy Bridges
needed help with soccer moms."

13:22.760 --> 13:25.096
Do you stand by that comment?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.973
I do, sir.

13:27.056 --> 13:31.227
And I'm extremely grateful to all
those soccer moms that elected her.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.774
For someone who is
hardly qualified to comment,

13:36.858 --> 13:39.068
you comment a lot, don't you, general?

13:46.617 --> 13:49.162
Come on, Kelly.
Did he ask her to resign?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.331
You know the rules.
We don't comment on...

13:51.414 --> 13:54.417
[man] Anonymous sources.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.128
- We off the record?
- Depends on what you're selling.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.839
Misquotes and inaccuracies
about the president.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.299
Report on that for a change.

14:01.382 --> 14:05.261
We're not shills for Mackenzie Allen,
Kelly. I gotta get inside.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.975
So, uh, what's the "what"
with you and Clooney?

14:11.059 --> 14:13.227
Oh, come on. A lady never tells.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.983
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.235
What's up, honey?

14:21.319 --> 14:24.655
Um, I have a question for you,
but, you know, it's probably bad timing.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.492
- You're gonna say no anyway.
- What am I gonna say no to?

14:27.575 --> 14:31.537
There's a party tomorrow night. There's
gonna be lots of other kids there.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.540
- Whose party?
- Mike's.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.666
You're right. No.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.545
Listen, Dad, I know I messed up last
week, and I'm... I'm really sorry but...

14:40.880 --> 14:43.257
Dad, I just need to be
with other kids my age

14:43.341 --> 14:45.927
where I'm not being watched
every second.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.597
- I don't know, Rebecca.
- Dad, I'm a 4.0 student.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.724
I don't drink, I don't do drugs.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.644
I mean, haven't I earned your trust?

14:54.727 --> 14:56.396
Are there going to be adults there?

14:56.479 --> 14:59.524
Mike's dad and about
30 Secret Service agents.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.028
- OK.
- Really? Because, Dad...

15:04.112 --> 15:06.781
Just take yes for an answer, Becca.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.742
- OK.
- OK.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.623
General, when I look
at your financial statements,

15:15.706 --> 15:17.667
I have to admit, I am a little envious.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.711
- Well, Bill Gates sure isn't.
- [chuckling]

15:22.296 --> 15:24.424
You sit on seven corporate boards.

15:24.507 --> 15:28.678
Two of those companies do billions of
dollars of business with the Pentagon,

15:28.761 --> 15:32.181
where a former officer of yours
is head of procurement and...

15:32.265 --> 15:36.352
Congressman, if you'll check
page 36 of these documents,

15:36.436 --> 15:39.230
I think you'll see that any fees
I've received

15:39.313 --> 15:41.524
as director of these corporations

15:41.607 --> 15:43.234
have been donated to charity.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.870
Hey, Vince. You have something
to go to the NSC?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.580
Yeah.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.582
- It's here. Thanks.
- Thank you.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.543
Did you know all this was happening
between Mac and Bridges?

16:00.626 --> 16:03.421
I didn't know a thing.
I think it's a bunch of bull.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.883
- She's cool.
- She is.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.261
Hey, Andrew, how long does it
usually take to get a drug test back?

16:10.344 --> 16:14.015
What do you care? You wouldn't recognize
a bong in a Cheech and Chong film.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.233
- Hey, Vince.
- Hello, Horace.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.696
- What's that?
- It's called an autopen.

16:28.779 --> 16:32.158
Saves your mom many hours
of work a day. Came in during JFK.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.244
Cool. Is she around?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.830
Uh, she's in a meeting.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.791
She should be wrapping up soon.
You can wait if you want.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.335
Ah, thanks.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.966
Want to get this book off the front
page? You have to create news.

16:49.050 --> 16:52.094
This education initiative of yours
is solid, but it's not sexy.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.138
This space initiative was Teddy's dream.

16:54.222 --> 16:57.725
You sign it, you eliminate the charges
that you were disloyal to him.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.103
What's the temperature
with our friends in the press?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.606
So far, the press isn't biting
on the inaccuracies,

17:03.689 --> 17:06.776
since we haven't denied the allegations
he asked you to resign.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.862
Tomorrow's papers are gonna be full
of attacking editorials.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.865
Polling about whether or not
you should remain in office.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.535
- Good thing I don't govern by polls.
- [knock on door]

17:16.536 --> 17:19.497
- Ma'am, your son is here to see you.
- Thank you, Vince.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.417
- Let's keep talking about this.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.964
[male announcer]
This is The War Room…

17:28.047 --> 17:30.007
Hey, baby.

17:30.091 --> 17:33.010
- Thought I'd give you a lift home.
- Oh, thank you.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.179
- [Jim] I'll be in my office.
- Hey, uh, Jim?

17:35.263 --> 17:38.724
Why don't you call it a night? This'll
all still be here in the morning.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.935
Right, ma'am.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.897
Hey, so you came all the way
downstairs just to walk me upstairs?

17:44.981 --> 17:48.317
That's very sweet. I do have
to stay here a little bit longer.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.487
Well, there's this...
there's this one thing. I got this...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.030
Kelly, Vince, go home.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.075
A good employee never leaves
before his boss, ma'am.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.953
I'm gonna get a jump
on tomorrow's briefing. Good night.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.539
- Good night, Kelly.
- What were you saying?

18:01.622 --> 18:04.917
Uh, nothing, really. I mean, I...

18:05.001 --> 18:09.797
You know, I'm sorry. Just give me
one second here. Sorry.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.551
[man on TV] One of them is dead, and
the other is not exactly talking to you.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.679
She doesn't have to.
I can cite Ms. Allen's words.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.018
[Hutchins] "Tonight,
from his hospital bed,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.854
our beloved president
has asked me to honor his wishes

18:24.937 --> 18:28.024
and resign the office
of the vice president."

18:28.107 --> 18:31.569
This is handwritten. It was delivered
anonymously to me this morning.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.155
That was supposed to be
the resignation speech

18:34.238 --> 18:36.365
that Mackenzie Allen
was gonna deliver...

18:40.119 --> 18:41.787
Mom?

18:44.040 --> 18:47.460
- Everything's gonna be OK, right?
- Oh, yeah. It'll just go away.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.088
Um, I am gonna have
to stick around for a little bit.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.090
- Yeah.
- Was there something you needed?

18:53.174 --> 18:56.886
- Nah. I'll see you later.
- Sure. OK. 'Night, baby.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.311
[clock ticking]

19:11.651 --> 19:13.736
- [knock on door]
- [Bridges] Yeah. Come on.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.863
I'm gonna lose 20 bucks
to Hendrickson.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.532
Miami's not gonna cover.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.619
Watch this. OK, he's open.
Hit 'em. Hit 'em.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.913
- Wow.
- Oh, well.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.083
Miami never covers on AstroTurf
when it's below freezing.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.294
The receivers aren't used
to the kind of cleats they have to wear.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.799
- You're happily married, right?
- To my job.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.636
Yeah. So did you see
the schedule for the summit?

19:38.719 --> 19:40.346
Sure.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.765
- Took a pencil to it, re-routed things.
- Mm-hm.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.184
I thought we'd find
a more appropriate use for you

19:45.267 --> 19:48.354
than meeting with their defense minister
about the West Bank Wall.

19:48.437 --> 19:52.525
OK. Well, you know, I'm pretty
well ensconced in that region. Wall…

19:52.608 --> 19:55.611
Oh, yeah, I know you are.
But Francis is all up in arms about it.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.779
He thought it should be

19:56.862 --> 20:00.658
more of a defense minister to defense
minister kind of thing. Oh, baby!

20:03.786 --> 20:07.248
So how can I be of service, if it's not
meeting with the defense minister?

20:07.331 --> 20:10.710
Uh, Jim wants you to hook up
with the culture minister.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.128
- Jim does? OK.
- Yeah.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.756
The Israelis think you might be able
to help out with a cultural exchange.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.717
It's a whole PR thing. It's great.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.511
OK, then, I better get with Jim.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.138
Get briefed.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.140
- Mac.
- Yeah.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.518
It's important, you know.
It's culture and all.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.147
Then thank you
for the vote of confidence.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.399
You're welcome.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.152
- [Rod] Mac?
- [clock chiming]

20:36.235 --> 20:37.903
Hey.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.158
We've found several dozen mistakes.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.494
You should stop, you know.
Trying to discredit him.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.247
He got most of it right.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.750
It began with Israel.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.169
That's when they decided
to get rid of me.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.171
That's when it started.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.924
I didn't see it before,
but it's clear now.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.803
Those are some anonymous sources
Hutchins had.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.973
Oh, anonymous my ass.
It was Jim.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.851
You should just outright ask him.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.519
You were a prosecutor.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.688
Look him in the eyes
when he answers you.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.398
You'll know if he's lying.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.695
- You coming up?
- I want to finish the book.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.865
I want to see how it ends
with Kelly and George Clooney.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.788
[woman] As many as 300 protesters

21:28.896 --> 21:30.790
gathered in front of
the White House today

21:30.873 --> 21:34.043
in reaction to allegations made
in Evan Hutchins tell-all book.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.045
- Hey, Amy.
- Two arrests were made...

21:36.128 --> 21:38.297
You know, you shouldn't be
watching this.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.092
Why do all those people
hate Mommy?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.347
It's just the way people are sometimes.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.265
But they don't even know her.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.018
I know. It's just…

21:51.101 --> 21:53.395
That's what's hard about
being president

21:53.479 --> 21:56.398
is people think they do.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.901
Do you hate Mommy too?

21:59.777 --> 22:00.945
Why would you say that?

22:01.028 --> 22:03.739
'Cause you didn't want her
being president either.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.825
You said she should step aside.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.371
Can I tell you a secret?

22:10.454 --> 22:13.791
But you can't tell anyone. Promise?

22:14.625 --> 22:18.629
I think Mommy is
a great woman. [laughs]

22:18.712 --> 22:20.798
But hey, you need
to get ready for school.

22:22.675 --> 22:26.512
So who was there that night?
At the Observatory.

22:26.595 --> 22:30.266
- Now, who had access to the letter?
- Full house from what I remember.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.102
Lots of staffers. Melanie Blackston,

22:33.185 --> 22:34.979
Speaker Templeton...

22:36.397 --> 22:37.648
Gardner.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.280
Look at that anger.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.292
- Hi, Agent Powers.
- Hi. Where's Rebecca?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.627
- Uh…
- Sorry. I just had to get my stuff.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.089
- Becca, can I have a minute?
- Um, sure.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.842
Uh, I understand that you want
to go to a party tonight

23:04.925 --> 23:07.344
at 1327 Claremont Street?

23:07.428 --> 23:08.554
Yeah.

23:08.637 --> 23:11.557
We've done a background check
on the family that lives there.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.101
We'll secure the location,
set up a perimeter,

23:14.184 --> 23:18.522
place agents in the residence and be on
alert for any illegal underage activity.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.858
- What?
- Just messing with you.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.985
We are putting a detail
outside the house,

23:23.068 --> 23:26.196
- and you'll have a panic button.
- Um, sure.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.115
[man] Kelly, we'd like a statement.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.534
I'd like a week in Maui,
but we both have to wait.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.703
Shouldn't the president resign
this time?

23:32.786 --> 23:35.331
- I won't comment.
- There's national outrage...

23:35.414 --> 23:37.166
And no comment means no comment.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.127
Kelly, I'm not asking about
the resignation speech, OK?

23:40.210 --> 23:42.171
- What then?
- No politics.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.882
You and Clooney.
A human interest piece.

23:47.885 --> 23:49.470
I'll tell you what.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.348
You write a piece on
the president's first 50 days in office

23:52.431 --> 23:56.685
and all she's accomplished in it,
and in return... Clooney.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.191
- Ma'am? You asked to see me?
- Yes. I did.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.819
Listen, I know you feel strongly
about Teddy's executive order,

24:05.903 --> 24:08.280
but I have decided to stick with my own.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.492
Ma'am, as I've said before,
right now, it is important to show...

24:11.575 --> 24:14.495
My agenda. Do you know how many
more people would go to college

24:14.578 --> 24:16.705
if they had interest-free student loans,

24:16.789 --> 24:20.334
in exchange for teaching
three years at our public schools?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.921
I know Teddy was in love
with a manned mission to Mars,

24:24.004 --> 24:25.339
and I am too,

24:25.422 --> 24:29.385
but not as much as I am with fixing
what needs to be done here, on Earth.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.221
- I'll make sure that it gets drafted.
- It already has been.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.264
I had it done when I was vice president.

24:34.348 --> 24:37.017
The president put it in a drawer.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.189
- Have you seen the protestors on TV?
- I did.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.067
Teddy never should have
asked me to resign

24:45.150 --> 24:49.571
or put me in the position of having
the citizens question my presidency.

24:49.655 --> 24:53.450
- Ma'am, with all due respect...
- But perhaps not with all due loyalty.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.870
Jim, I need to know.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.415
Are you the source of the leaks?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.876
Did you tell Evan Hutchins
that Teddy asked me to step down?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.628
No.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.298
But if you believe I did,
then we've got a problem.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.892
You'll have my resignation on your desk
by the end of the business day.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.665
[muttering]

25:43.042 --> 25:45.377
[footsteps approaching]

25:47.129 --> 25:50.507
- Wanna play chess? I'm pretty good.
- Not right now.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.636
Yesterday at school,

25:54.720 --> 25:58.515
we spelled all the words
we could think of starting with a D.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.226
[sighs] Can you leave me alone, Ames?

26:01.310 --> 26:04.980
- Like dinosaurs, dolphins, dummy...
- Amy!

26:05.064 --> 26:07.733
I can't think. Go.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.402
You're mean.

26:15.032 --> 26:18.077
[dance music playing]

26:23.373 --> 26:25.000
- [Rebecca gasps]
- Whoa, watch it.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.293
Sorry.

26:26.376 --> 26:30.255
- Do you have a towel or something?
- Yeah, uh, upstairs.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.342
You wanna go up to my room?
It's getting kinda crowded in here.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.385
Um, well, where's your dad?

26:35.469 --> 26:37.846
Ah, watching football somewhere.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.557
Don't worry. The door's got a lock.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.684
- Oh, great.
- [cell phone beeps]

26:42.768 --> 26:44.895
- [boy] Where is everyone?
- Hello?

26:44.978 --> 26:48.398
Leave me alone, Ricky.
Becca, where are you?

26:48.482 --> 26:50.067
Hey, I'm over here by the stairs.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.528
- Where are you?
- Oh, OK. I see you.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.740
- Oh, hey.
- [Ricky] But you rode with me.

26:56.824 --> 27:00.035
- Is Horace here yet?
- He's home working on a school paper.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.829
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.080
[Ricky] Jen!

27:03.872 --> 27:04.998
Bec, come on. Let's go.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.543
Don't you dare leave me alone
with him. I'm serious.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.628
- Please stay.
- I'll see you later.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.884
[phone rings]

27:23.684 --> 27:25.769
[click, machine humming]

27:28.230 --> 27:29.648
What's going on, Horace?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.777
My teacher asked me
to get Mom's autograph.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.572
- I didn't want to bug her...
- You shouldn't be using that.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.158
- Vince should've put it away.
- Uh, sorry.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.371
So I smiled.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.622
And then he smiled at me.

27:45.706 --> 27:49.626
And when he walked across the room,
it was like he was, um...

27:49.710 --> 27:51.712
I don't know, gliding.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.422
- Gliding?
- Yeah.

27:53.505 --> 27:57.259
And, uh, he didn't say a word. He just
put his hand on the small of my back...

27:57.342 --> 28:00.429
- Uh, go on.
- ...and kissed my neck.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.015
You ever start spinning
from a kiss, Steve?

28:03.098 --> 28:05.184
[chuckles] Uh, yeah, sure.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.811
Yeah. And then he, um,
he pulled me closer...

28:07.895 --> 28:10.939
- Wow. Um, this is for real?
- No.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.942
- No?
- No. No. None of it.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.112
Check the inauguration guest list.
He's not even on it.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.989
It's just one of the 37
other mistakes

28:19.072 --> 28:21.450
our staff has found
in the Hutchins book so far.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.370
- Which means I have nothing?
- Yes, but you have it exclusively.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.832
You post the story on
President Allen's first 50 days yet?

28:28.916 --> 28:32.044
- Runs tomorrow.
- Great.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.009
[Templeton] The gentleman
from Texas has the floor.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.845
[Ferrer] Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.805
I know everyone's tired,

28:43.889 --> 28:46.475
so before we adjourn,
I was wondering, general,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.936
if we could get to know you
better as a man.

28:50.771 --> 28:52.648
[Ferrer] You played football for Army.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.108
I got knocked around
a little bit. Yes, sir.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.069
Hope you're a Redskins fan.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.822
- Compromise is part of the job.
- [crowd laughing]

29:00.906 --> 29:03.784
- And you've been married...?
- Thirty-five years.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.370
My wife says we have
a good first marriage.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.455
[laughing]

29:08.538 --> 29:11.375
[Ferrer] I've read you lost
your daughter.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.709
I'm very sorry.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.087
She sounded
like a remarkable woman.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.672
She was.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.841
Abby and I are raising our grandchild.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.886
- Single mother, was she?
- Not that it matters,

29:22.970 --> 29:25.555
but yes, she was.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.308
[Ferrer] A doctor who herself
became a patient.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.435
Tragic.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.689
It was.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.192
Excuse my ignorance here,
but, um...

29:37.276 --> 29:40.070
...I fail to understand
the relevance of any of this.

29:40.153 --> 29:44.157
Everything about a candidate
is subject to consideration.

29:44.241 --> 29:48.078
- So your daughter...
- The gentleman from Texas will yield.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.998
[Ferrer] I will, sir.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.379
The hour is late.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.966
I propose we resume these hearings

30:01.049 --> 30:03.218
on Monday morning.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.430
- Thank you, general.
- Mr. Chairman.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.660
[Templeton laughs]

30:28.744 --> 30:30.120
You're doing great.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.457
In the old days I would've
challenged you to a duel.

30:36.752 --> 30:38.712
You know my chief of staff,
Jayne Murray.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.630
- How do you do?
- General.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.091
Sit down. Please.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.593
- Drink?
- No.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.553
- Boss?
- No, thanks.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.848
You know exactly where this line
of questioning is headed, don't you?

30:49.931 --> 30:51.683
I do.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.770
I assume it was my good friend
Congressman Wilcox

30:54.853 --> 30:58.774
who put me in this situation,
who betrayed me.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.360
There's one thing I can't abide.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.990
Private lives, personal tragedies
must be respected.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.243
What do you want, Nate?

31:10.327 --> 31:12.788
You want me to withdraw my name?

31:12.871 --> 31:15.290
You want to embarrass
the president? Me?

31:15.374 --> 31:18.085
Tell me what the agenda is,
and we can get to it.

31:18.168 --> 31:20.253
We'll take an up-and-down vote.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.299
[scoffs] Ferrer is just grandstanding.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.385
He's not fooling anybody on the Hill.

31:26.468 --> 31:30.263
Your good buddy Wilcox?
He disgusts me.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.182
His disloyalty to you.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.601
And your grandchild?

31:34.684 --> 31:36.812
Don't you worry about a thing.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.897
It's done. Buried.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.982
Gone away with, I promise you.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.404
So you just call a vote?

31:45.487 --> 31:48.281
- You can do that?
- I'm the boss.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.659
[Murray] Democrats love you,
most Republicans

31:50.742 --> 31:52.994
just want the government back
into one piece.

31:53.078 --> 31:57.124
The whip says that right now, the
confirmation's pretty much in the bag.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.292
But if we let this Ferrer thing go...

32:00.168 --> 32:01.294
...it could get dicey.

32:01.378 --> 32:05.298
I'd have preferred it if she'd chosen
somebody from my party, but she didn't.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.968
She's a loose cannon.
With you we got lucky.

32:08.051 --> 32:10.637
You're a bona fide leader.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.640
You're somebody who can say
good night to this country,

32:13.723 --> 32:15.142
and we'll sleep OK.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.311
[Murray] By tomorrow you could be
vice president, general.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.731
We've put out a quorum call.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.366
I won't forget this.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.034
I'm counting on that.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.203
Hey.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.792
It's crazy, isn't it?

32:40.876 --> 32:46.214
The politics of personal destruction,
of character assassination.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.094
It's gotten so mean up here.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.348
- It has.
- [clasping hands]

32:55.432 --> 32:57.100
Take care.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.565
With what we've got...

33:03.648 --> 33:05.317
...we own him.

33:07.027 --> 33:09.196
I think I'll have that drink.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.661
[Ricky] The funniest part
was he was like...

33:16.745 --> 33:18.872
- [Horace] Jenny.
- Hey.

33:18.955 --> 33:21.917
I thought you had to write
a paper or something.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.710
Yeah, I took care of it.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.796
- Great.
- So where's the beer?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.929
[knock on door]

33:34.012 --> 33:35.555
Ma'am. A minute?

33:37.474 --> 33:39.809
- That for me?
- Yes, ma'am.

33:41.311 --> 33:45.524
I wanted you to know that
regardless of what you may think,

33:45.607 --> 33:48.151
it's been my honor to serve you.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.987
Thank you.

33:51.071 --> 33:54.407
[footsteps leaving]

33:55.742 --> 33:57.994
Ma'am, I have to say,

33:58.078 --> 34:02.958
I found a passage in the book regarding
the North Korean disarmament talks.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.877
When you suggested
a secret bilateral negotiation,

34:05.961 --> 34:09.214
- how Teddy berated you for it.
- I remember that night well.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.549
My ears are still ringing.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.426
There was just the three of us,
and I never spoke of it again.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.428
I'm fairly certain you didn't either.

34:15.512 --> 34:19.808
And yet Hutchins details it
with remarkable accuracy.

34:22.894 --> 34:25.981
Are you saying Teddy himself
was Hutchins' source?

34:28.775 --> 34:30.610
The truth is

34:30.694 --> 34:34.114
he would use Hutchins often when
he wanted to get something out there.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.658
They were friends in that way.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.035
Why would Teddy
want to paint me so badly?

34:39.119 --> 34:41.580
I think he saw you as someone
whose presence

34:41.663 --> 34:44.916
was becoming larger
than the presidency itself.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.086
And he was right.

34:48.169 --> 34:51.631
The difference is that he thought
that you were a threat to his legacy,

34:51.715 --> 34:54.551
that you were overshadowing him.
And I thought...

34:56.886 --> 35:00.015
I thought you yourself
were the legacy.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.983
He couldn't have given him
my resignation speech.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.819
That's as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.991
Good night. And good luck.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.836
- [Vince] Mr. Gardner.
- What is it, Vince?

35:29.919 --> 35:33.590
I need to talk to you. I could talk to
the president but thought the chain...

35:33.673 --> 35:36.259
Maybe you should go to her directly.
I gotta get home.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.887
I'm gonna come back positive.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.847
- From the drug screening.
- Pardon me?

35:40.930 --> 35:43.725
When the tests come back,
I'm gonna come up positive...

35:43.808 --> 35:46.311
Stop. Now you need to get a lawyer.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.605
It's not for coke or meth
or anything like that.

35:48.688 --> 35:51.900
- Vince.
- It's... I'm HIV-positive.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.945
My God, Vince.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.158
Nobody knows. About the disease.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.534
About the drug.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.995
About anything.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.124
- I just don't know what to do.
- Look, Vince, I want to help you.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.503
I really do, but you gotta trust me,
I can't hear another word.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.254
But what should I do?

36:15.006 --> 36:17.801
They don't test for that.
Only for controlled substances.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.095
Anything else is a violation
of your privacy.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.431
I doubt if you have anything
to worry about.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.350
At least on that score.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.940
Hey, kiddo.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.360
I just signed it.
My first executive order.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.612
- The education initiative.
- Mm-hm.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.698
Wow. I mean, that's it?

36:39.781 --> 36:43.159
No fanfare? Just signed it? Alone?

36:43.243 --> 36:45.245
I'm a no-fanfare kind of president.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.417
Jim offered me his resignation.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.503
- Good.
- He's not the leak.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.965
He's not the one who betrayed me.
I did what you said.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.926
I asked him. I looked in his eyes
when he answered.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.845
He didn't do it.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.389
OK.

37:04.472 --> 37:08.393
But this whole situation
has taught me something.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.730
That no matter what happens,

37:11.813 --> 37:17.152
there is only one person
that I know has my back.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.453
Well... Madam President.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.748
I don't want you to go to New York.

37:29.831 --> 37:33.293
I don't want you to be baseball
commissioner. I want you to stay here,

37:33.376 --> 37:34.711
with me.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.505
I'd like that.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.175
What's my title?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.845
I haven't given it any thought.

37:44.846 --> 37:47.056
We can talk about it, though.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.434
Kelly's waiting for us.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.774
[rock music playing]

38:03.448 --> 38:05.950
- Mike.
- It's OK. I got some right here.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.494
[Rebecca] Mike, no.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.996
- Mike.
- What's wrong? It's OK.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.040
- Mike, you know what?
- It's OK, it's OK…

38:12.123 --> 38:14.250
No, Mike. [sighs]

38:14.334 --> 38:16.461
I don't know. I just...

38:18.129 --> 38:20.006
I'm sorry, I just can't.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.384
It's all right.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.094
Really, it's fine.

38:25.178 --> 38:29.349
- I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.
- No. I'm not, OK?

38:29.432 --> 38:31.100
I'm not.

38:32.268 --> 38:36.606
Bec, look, I don't want you to do
anything that you're not ready to do.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.734
It's cool.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.111
Really?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.578
You leave first...

38:50.662 --> 38:52.997
...so we're not seen
going down together.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.834
OK.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.009
- Sorry.
- Hey.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.934
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

39:21.860 --> 39:23.361
[beep]

39:29.534 --> 39:32.871
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.082
Good evening. Please be seated.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.086
A short time ago,

39:40.169 --> 39:42.881
I signed my first executive order
as president,

39:43.251 --> 39:45.592
EO 23019.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.803
It establishes a national program

39:48.887 --> 39:51.723
of interest-free student loans.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.643
This order will allow
thousands of students

39:55.727 --> 39:58.646
who otherwise would not have
a shot at a four-year education

39:58.730 --> 40:00.356
to be provided with one.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.235
It will be known as
the Bridges Student Loan Program.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.614
With that, I am happy to open
the floor to any questions.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.949
[reporters clamoring]

40:10.033 --> 40:11.284
- Luis.
- Madam President,

40:11.367 --> 40:14.495
did President Bridges call on you
from his deathbed to resign?

40:19.083 --> 40:21.002
You all want to know about this book,

40:21.085 --> 40:23.713
about what is and isn't true?

40:23.796 --> 40:25.131
OK.

40:25.882 --> 40:28.176
This country deserves to hear
my answers.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.596
So I am going to stand here
and give you answers,

40:31.679 --> 40:34.706
until you have no more questions,

40:35.099 --> 40:38.186
and then I will not speak
to this subject again.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.939
- Agreed?
- [reporters murmuring]

40:42.023 --> 40:44.442
I may be wrong, but I think
I'm going to need a seat.

40:52.617 --> 40:56.496
The answer to your question,
Luis, is yes.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.333
President Bridges was
a great leader and my friend,

41:00.416 --> 41:03.378
but he had no authority
to ask that of me.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.547
The Constitution not only empowers me,

41:06.631 --> 41:09.717
it requires me to become president.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.178
The people elected me to this position,

41:12.261 --> 41:15.056
and only the people
and their representatives

41:15.139 --> 41:17.308
can ask me to step down.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.921
I will never apologize
for doing my job.

41:23.398 --> 41:26.317
If anything, from this point on,

41:26.401 --> 41:29.070
I only pledge to do it better.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.991
- Next question.
- [reporters clamoring]

41:49.549 --> 41:51.884
[Murray] Jim, you should see this.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.264
The ayes are 386,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.766
and the nays are 46.

41:58.850 --> 42:02.395
- Your guy's about to be confirmed.
- The resolution to confirm is carried.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.605
Ladies and gentlemen,

42:04.689 --> 42:08.818
I present to you
General Warren Fitzgerald Keaton,

42:08.901 --> 42:12.905
vice president of
the United States of America.
