00:10.037 --> 00:12.718
- You're only making this
harder on yourself mate.

00:13.158 --> 00:15.578
(Song, 9 to 5 plays
in the background)

00:15.678 --> 00:17.679
- You'll never take me alive.

00:19.279 --> 00:21.519
- Come on mate, keep up.
- I'm trying.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.401
(Song, 9 to 5 plays
in the background)

00:28.041 --> 00:29.541
- My feet are killing me.

00:29.641 --> 00:31.901
I've seen 20 bloody flats
already this week.

00:32.001 --> 00:33.942
- Yeah, I'm sorry
you can't use my spare room,

00:34.042 --> 00:35.062
I need it for my home gym.

00:35.162 --> 00:36.382
- It's clearly working.

00:36.482 --> 00:37.943
- Oh!

00:38.043 --> 00:38.943
Gotcha.

00:39.043 --> 00:41.043
- Nice one, Fran.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.304
Run again and I'll shoot you.

00:43.404 --> 00:45.584
- Do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?

00:45.684 --> 00:47.024
I'm serving a Mafia mate.

00:47.124 --> 00:48.985
You kill me, someone
will come after you.

00:49.085 --> 00:50.865
- Who, Long John Silver?
- Crazy, no.

00:50.965 --> 00:52.065
- What are you doing?

00:52.165 --> 00:53.866
- Head shot.
- His heads not up there, mate.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.666
He's not ten foot tall.
- You sure?

00:55.766 --> 00:57.766
- Honestly.

00:58.567 --> 00:59.947
See.

01:00.047 --> 01:02.147
- Wait, I'll cut in on our next
shipment full of steroids.

01:02.247 --> 01:04.728
Worth a fortune.
- So where is the head then?

01:05.168 --> 01:06.428
- Surprise, bitches.

01:06.528 --> 01:08.529
(gunshot)

01:08.889 --> 01:10.889
- 'Bout there.

01:13.049 --> 01:16.370
♪ Don't you want me, baby? ♪

01:17.330 --> 01:20.531
♪ Don't you want me, Oh ♪

01:21.371 --> 01:22.471
- Oh, oh, oh.
Found it.

01:22.571 --> 01:26.872
- Oh my god. Stonely High
class of 89 reunion.

01:26.972 --> 01:28.913
- Woo hoo.

01:29.013 --> 01:31.273
Oh, my gosh.

01:31.373 --> 01:34.194
- I am so excited
that you've actually allowed

01:34.294 --> 01:35.754
us to go to one
of these things.

01:35.854 --> 01:37.474
- You know what? I'm actually
looking forward to it, you know

01:37.574 --> 01:40.915
we've got the jobs rolling in.
- Yeah we've got some proper dosh at last.

01:41.015 --> 01:42.275
Exactly.
Thank you very much.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.156
God, who would've thought
we'd be rocking up to our old

01:44.256 --> 01:46.636
school in a Mercedes B Class.
- Yes.

01:46.736 --> 01:49.117
- We've come a long way
from those two girls who left

01:49.217 --> 01:51.877
that place with just an A level
and three STDs between them.

01:51.977 --> 01:53.237
- Oh, my God.

01:53.337 --> 01:55.198
- Do you think Danny Kemp's
gonna be there tonight?

01:55.298 --> 01:58.278
He was so freaking hot.
- Hot? Are you serious?

01:58.378 --> 02:01.079
Wasn't he the guy that had a
danger wank at the back of RE?

02:01.179 --> 02:03.079
- What can I say?
I've always liked a bad boy.

02:03.179 --> 02:04.560
- Oh, here we are mate.

02:04.660 --> 02:06.880
Let's give it the old salute.

02:06.980 --> 02:09.100
(mimics guitar)

02:11.181 --> 02:13.661
(upbeat 80's pop music)

02:14.942 --> 02:16.942
- Oh.

02:21.743 --> 02:26.344
(Heavy Metal Rock music)

02:29.064 --> 02:30.325
- It's gonna be so nice

02:30.425 --> 02:32.285
to just have one night where
we can just have some fun

02:32.385 --> 02:34.245
and not worry about
getting our heads blown off.

02:34.345 --> 02:37.546
- As Danny Kemp yelled
at the black of RE, "Amen!"

02:38.066 --> 02:42.067
(upbeat music)

02:45.028 --> 02:46.688
One more time, what
do we do for a living?

02:46.788 --> 02:50.129
- Okay, we definitely don't
kill people for a living.

02:50.229 --> 02:52.249
We work in security.
- Exactly.

02:52.349 --> 02:54.129
- It's fake but cool.

02:54.229 --> 02:55.490
And just a slight hint of danger.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.730
- And in our downtime we
breed and train pedigree dogs.

02:57.830 --> 03:00.291
- What? I didn't
sign off on that bit.

03:00.391 --> 03:02.371
- Oh, yes.
I still hold the record

03:02.471 --> 03:06.272
for the school shot put.
- It's all flooding back.

03:06.832 --> 03:08.832
The bunking off, the cheeky (fakes smoking).

03:10.513 --> 03:13.053
That time you got
so nervous that you

03:13.153 --> 03:15.694
pissed yourself
on stage during Oliver.

03:15.794 --> 03:18.214
(crowd laughing)

03:18.314 --> 03:21.095
Why would you bring that up? I
still have nightmares about that

03:21.195 --> 03:22.575
- Still too soon?
- Yes.

03:22.675 --> 03:24.775
- Okay, got it.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.096
- You don't think anyone else is
going to remember that, do you?

03:27.196 --> 03:29.616
- Of course they won't. We're
not twelve anymore, are we?

03:29.716 --> 03:30.977
- Yeah, they'll have moved on.

03:31.077 --> 03:34.657
- Hey, hey, hey, Oliver Piss!

03:34.757 --> 03:36.218
- And I'm out of here.

03:36.318 --> 03:39.138
- That is one drunk, come on.

03:39.238 --> 03:42.939
It's our night off, let's
have some fun, yeah?

03:43.039 --> 03:46.460
- Absolutely, just don't
leave me on my own.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.060
- Of course not mate.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.160
- Come on, come on.

03:53.121 --> 03:56.522
(dramatic music)

03:59.042 --> 04:02.283
(intense music)

04:03.843 --> 04:06.163
- Oh
(glass hitting the ground)

04:06.484 --> 04:09.064
(intense music)

04:09.164 --> 04:11.585
- It's so weird. Everyone's
back in their old cliques.

04:11.685 --> 04:17.006
I know, you've got goths,
the nerds, the footy lads.

04:18.006 --> 04:19.786
- Meanies.

04:19.886 --> 04:22.907
Why aren't we in a clique?
- What are you talking about?

04:23.007 --> 04:25.667
We were the funky fresh crew.
You, me,

04:25.767 --> 04:28.688
and occasionally a
foreign language student.

04:29.408 --> 04:32.089
- Oh, it's our song.
Clear a space.

04:32.689 --> 04:36.569
(upbeat music)
(Song: David Bowie, Let's Dance)

04:38.570 --> 04:43.531
(upbeat music)
(Song: David Bowie, Let's Dance)

04:48.572 --> 04:55.173
♪ Let's dance. Put on your red
shoes and dance the blues ♪

04:56.613 --> 04:59.134
(music fades)

05:00.174 --> 05:02.235
- Fran, you looking
exactly the same.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.635
- When you find an iconic look,
you tend to stick with it,

05:04.735 --> 05:07.756
you know Steve Jobs,
Karl Lagerfeld, Kim Jong-un.

05:07.856 --> 05:12.316
- Oh, Danny Kemp
(cat purrs)

05:12.416 --> 05:14.997
- You're literally (mimics
cat purr) over a child mate.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.618
He was held back three
years, it's actually fine.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.598
- Who's she?

05:20.698 --> 05:24.479
- Now I think she left
quite soon after you arrived.

05:24.579 --> 05:26.079
- Yes.
- We were quite good mates

05:26.179 --> 05:29.120
before that, though.
- Wasn't she incredibly shy?

05:29.220 --> 05:31.280
- Yeah.
- She didn't say anything at all

05:31.380 --> 05:33.081
I remember it, she
was a bit creepy, to be honest.

05:33.181 --> 05:36.101
What was her name?
- Kat Gateskill

05:36.421 --> 05:38.422
- Kat!

05:38.862 --> 05:40.162
- It's so good to
see you, Jamie.

05:40.262 --> 05:41.762
- You look amazing.

05:41.862 --> 05:43.203
- You look amazing.

05:43.303 --> 05:44.763
Where did you get that outfit?

05:44.863 --> 05:47.183
Because I want it now.

05:49.144 --> 05:51.284
Hey, Fran.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.285
So what are you both up to?

05:53.385 --> 05:55.205
Still doing
everything together?

05:55.305 --> 05:57.125
The Inseparable duo.

05:57.225 --> 05:59.326
- We do work
together, actually.

05:59.426 --> 06:03.046
- Oh, nice.
- For a security company.

06:03.146 --> 06:04.247
- Okay.

06:04.347 --> 06:07.127
- Events, crowd control,
that sort of stuff.

06:07.227 --> 06:09.128
It's a little bit more
complicated than that, Jamie.

06:09.228 --> 06:10.608
It's surveillance.
As such,

06:10.708 --> 06:13.248
it's gathering, close
protection. That sort of stuff.

06:13.348 --> 06:16.129
I won't bore you with details,
but it's high end stuff.

06:16.229 --> 06:18.610
How about you?
- So sorry to interrupt,

06:18.710 --> 06:21.430
but would you mind signing
a copy of your book for me?

06:22.430 --> 06:25.951
- Thanks to you, I am becoming
who I always wanted to be.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.531
Turns out it's divorced and
living in a relationship

06:28.631 --> 06:30.052
with my former therapist.

06:30.152 --> 06:33.112
- That's great.
Thank you.

06:35.033 --> 06:36.653
Oh, so embarrassing.

06:36.753 --> 06:39.414
I run a little business.

06:39.514 --> 06:43.734
A few bestselling self help
books, speaking tools across

06:43.834 --> 06:45.295
the world of minor
luxury products.

06:45.395 --> 06:48.695
I guess it's more of a
brand than a business.

06:48.795 --> 06:50.216
- That's incredible.

06:50.316 --> 06:52.316
- I've never heard
of your stuff.

06:52.676 --> 06:55.337
Probably because it's targeted
more towards people who need help.

06:55.437 --> 06:58.637
And I'm in a really
good space right now.

07:00.678 --> 07:07.439
(Kat laughs)

07:09.840 --> 07:13.040
- At least you've still got that
sharp sense of humour, Fran.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.181
Oh, I better go
check on the buffet.

07:15.281 --> 07:17.101
I'm head of the
organising committee.

07:17.201 --> 07:21.322
Control free alert.
- [robot voice] Control freak detected.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.362
- I'll catch you later.

07:26.683 --> 07:27.783
What does she mean,

07:27.883 --> 07:30.284
at least I've still got
that sense of humour?

07:32.804 --> 07:36.325
(upbeat music)

07:37.445 --> 07:38.865
(water splash)

07:38.965 --> 07:41.146
- Who are you and
what you're doing here?

07:41.246 --> 07:43.666
- I don't know what you mean.
I'm here for the reunion.

07:43.766 --> 07:46.007
We were in school together.

07:46.687 --> 07:48.807
(water splashing)

07:49.407 --> 07:50.788
- Listen mate. I've been
doing this job

07:50.888 --> 07:52.548
long enough to know exactly
what it means when some dodgy

07:52.648 --> 07:54.708
little weirdo approaches us
with his hand in his jacket.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.749
Please, I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:56.849 --> 07:59.069
Sure you don't I guess you
were innocently reaching for

07:59.169 --> 08:01.230
- Business cards.

08:01.330 --> 08:03.870
I'm in office supplies now.
It's me,

08:03.970 --> 08:06.211
it's Robin Sharma.

08:09.851 --> 08:12.312
- Robin, we are so sorry.

08:12.412 --> 08:13.832
- Honestly, don't
worry about it.

08:13.932 --> 08:17.793
It's just when you're in private
security. It can get a little bit edgy.

08:17.893 --> 08:19.313
Itchy trigger fingers.

08:19.413 --> 08:21.754
Oh, literally.
Obviously.

08:21.854 --> 08:23.854
- Oh, gosh,
that sounds exciting.

08:24.374 --> 08:26.715
I mean, it's not every day you
get waterboarded when you sell

08:26.815 --> 08:29.015
toner cartridges
for a living.

08:29.855 --> 08:32.276
- It's mad, isn't it.
You see, it's been so long.

08:32.376 --> 08:34.576
I didn't recognise you at all.

08:35.896 --> 08:38.517
Probably the glasses.
Went a bit crazy

08:38.617 --> 08:41.318
and treated myself
to some laser surgery.

08:41.418 --> 08:44.358
My 50th, it was either that or
installing a smart meter.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.559
But I thought no better
to have something to really

08:46.659 --> 08:48.159
look forward
to for your 60th.

08:48.259 --> 08:50.599
- Well, you are looking
good, my friend.

08:50.699 --> 08:52.360
- Robin Sharma.

08:52.460 --> 08:53.440
Robin Sharma.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.880
I used to sit next
to you in geography.

08:55.980 --> 08:57.161
- Pretty sure it
was chemistry.

08:57.261 --> 08:59.921
- Oh, my bad with Mr.
Dunham.

09:00.021 --> 09:01.762
- Mr. Dunham was history.

09:01.862 --> 09:04.842
Chemistry was Ms. Bole.

09:04.942 --> 09:06.943
Ms. Bole.

09:07.423 --> 09:10.223
I always thought it
was Ms. Bole.

09:11.944 --> 09:14.324
- Right!
Ms. Bole.

09:14.424 --> 09:17.625
She was always very
insistent on that.

09:18.785 --> 09:21.565
- She was, yes she was.

09:21.665 --> 09:22.806
Robin Sharma.

09:22.906 --> 09:25.126
It's amazing what you
remember from way back.

09:25.226 --> 09:26.566
- Oh, don't get me started.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.747
If these walls could talk.

09:29.707 --> 09:32.168
We have some fun, didn't we?

09:32.268 --> 09:37.769
Tell you what, I found some
cannabis in my stepson's

09:37.869 --> 09:39.489
bedroom and Fran,

09:39.589 --> 09:42.450
I seem to remember you
were partial to wacky

09:42.550 --> 09:47.330
Becky, want to go outside
for a cheeky puffer-roni?

09:47.430 --> 09:49.711
Come on, schools out.

09:52.151 --> 09:55.132
- We better go mingle.
- Yeah, of course.

09:55.232 --> 09:57.613
No worries.
Catch you in a bit.

09:57.713 --> 09:59.893
- See you in there mate.

09:59.993 --> 10:04.074
(dramatic music)

10:05.634 --> 10:10.335
- Man, I have not thought
about Robin Sharma in years.

10:10.435 --> 10:14.296
Office supplies? It's crazy what some
people end up doing, isn't it?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.536
- Yeah, it's bonkers, isn't it?

10:16.636 --> 10:20.357
(upbeat music)

10:24.438 --> 10:26.098
- Oh, it's Danny Kemp.

10:26.198 --> 10:28.419
- Oh, shit.
- I know, and

10:28.519 --> 10:30.379
he's still got it.

10:30.479 --> 10:32.379
Check it

10:32.479 --> 10:35.120
- You're all good.
- Wish me luck.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.381
- Listen, I need a signal if
you're going back to the van.

10:39.481 --> 10:41.181
Do you want to put a sock
on the exhaust or something?

10:41.281 --> 10:44.642
The signal will be the van
bouncing up and down mate.

10:45.082 --> 10:49.203
(upbeat music)

10:50.483 --> 10:54.244
(upbeat music)

10:55.564 --> 10:58.264
- So you still got that little
convertible, I seem to

10:58.364 --> 11:00.985
remember the back seat
being very comfortable.

11:01.085 --> 11:02.185
- Of course I do.

11:53.615 --> 11:54.956

11:55.056 --> 11:56.796

to do about it?

11:56.896 --> 11:58.476
- Yeah.

11:58.576 --> 12:01.437
Oh my God.
Did you see Oliver Piss?

12:01.537 --> 12:04.797
- Yes. Please sir, can I
piss some more?

12:04.897 --> 12:06.078
(laughter)

12:06.178 --> 12:09.098
- You got a piss
a pocket or two.

12:11.299 --> 12:12.799
- I wonder what
she does now.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.959
- Who cares?

12:14.059 --> 12:15.320
- If that was all I
was remembered for,

12:15.420 --> 12:18.900
I would've been way too
embarrassed to show my face.

12:19.620 --> 12:23.401
- Yeah, does she even know
how tragic she looks?

12:23.501 --> 12:25.562

You know, just hanging

15:22.216 --> 15:23.757

mind if I butt in?

15:23.857 --> 15:25.517
Seriously, what
is your problem?

15:25.617 --> 15:28.477
- Tina, your husband's on the
phone in the school office.

15:28.577 --> 15:30.438
He said he couldn't get
through on your mobile.

15:30.538 --> 15:34.459
It sounds quite urgent.
- One night. That's all I ask for.

15:37.099 --> 15:40.600
I don't know if you remember me.
- It's Jamie, isn't it?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.320
Of course, I remember you.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.681
You're always so bubbly

15:44.781 --> 15:49.382
and if I remember
correctly, very naughty.

15:50.982 --> 15:55.023
(slow music plays)

15:58.503 --> 16:00.044
- So why do I listen
to these idiots?

16:00.144 --> 16:01.564
You know I am who I am and if

16:01.664 --> 16:04.205
they don't like it, they can
just shove it up their ass.

16:04.305 --> 16:05.725
- Exactly.

16:05.825 --> 16:07.945
I mean, at the end of the day
we just have to be ourselves.

16:08.505 --> 16:10.826
No point in pretending
to be someone we're not.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.287

- God,
yeah, the nickname.

16:35.031 --> 16:38.411
Who cares about that now?
- Everyone apparently.

16:38.511 --> 16:40.372
I mean,
you're the only one

16:40.472 --> 16:44.392
that hasn't brought it up.
Haven't mentioned it once.

16:44.792 --> 16:48.093
- I remember how upset
you used to get about.

16:48.193 --> 16:50.454
I mean, you wet yourself

16:50.554 --> 16:54.374
in a school production
of Cats and suddenly you're

16:54.474 --> 16:56.475
Mr. Pisstofolies for life.

16:58.515 --> 17:03.716
- Mr. Pisstofolies.
Kids can be so cruel.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.417

still offering

17:07.517 --> 17:09.517

handle that spliff.

17:09.837 --> 17:12.918

to all that.

I've got some gum. Keep you from vomming.

18:12.570 --> 18:15.910

18:17.171 --> 18:18.791
- Yeah.
- Bye.

18:18.891 --> 18:21.271
- What's up?
- Sharma is trying to kill us.

18:21.371 --> 18:22.752
- Sharma?

18:22.852 --> 18:25.072
- Not Sharma, someone
pretending to be Sharma.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.993
- Then who's that then?

18:27.093 --> 18:29.473
- Some kind of weird, footy,
dumb, pirate meat head.

18:29.573 --> 18:32.714

when he said he knew people.

mate.

19:47.388 --> 19:48.689
- Ah, come on.
What are friends for?

19:53.950 --> 19:55.890

19:55.990 --> 19:57.730

clique of two. Never,

19:57.830 --> 20:00.591
never mess with the
funky fresh crew.

20:02.551 --> 20:04.292
Just you and me now.

20:04.392 --> 20:05.612
- Hey, guys.

20:05.712 --> 20:07.572
Fran, are you sure
you're okay to drive?

20:07.672 --> 20:09.493
Or did you manage
to get most of it out?

20:09.593 --> 20:13.293
- Yeah, I wasn't actually drunk.
- Oh right?

20:13.393 --> 20:17.334
Okay, so that's just
your normal pallor then?

20:17.434 --> 20:20.755
- Well, I mean, some of us
like to keep it natural.

20:22.675 --> 20:27.076
- Jamie, I wanted you
to have a copy of my book.

20:27.836 --> 20:31.077
Danny Kemp could be just
a start of you becoming.

20:32.317 --> 20:33.617

20:33.717 --> 20:35.258
you crashing
at mine for a bit.

20:35.358 --> 20:37.858
Honestly, I'd be delighted to
have you. My card is in the book.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.339
- Thanks, Kat.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.439
I'll be in touch.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.740
Oh.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.701
Oh.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.901
- Sorry, you're moving
in with Kat Gateskill?

20:53.001 --> 20:54.301
- When I told her about

20:54.401 --> 20:55.762
my living sitch and she's
offered me a room when I look

20:55.842 --> 20:58.622
for a new place, it's
really kind of her, right?

20:58.722 --> 20:59.703
Wow.

20:59.803 --> 21:03.163
Look how cool
Kat's business card is.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.704
I'll tell you what, I'm
going to have some made up.

21:05.804 --> 21:07.504
- Oh no, I think that's
a really good idea.

21:07.604 --> 21:08.824
Yeah.
Like your name,

21:08.924 --> 21:11.345
phone number, and "I kill
people for a living".

21:11.445 --> 21:12.665
- The number's fake,

21:12.765 --> 21:15.586
and when you phone it,
you get the talking clock.
