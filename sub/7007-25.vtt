WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.969
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:03.069 --> 00:05.230
- Tool Time!
- That's right!

00:05.338 --> 00:09.707
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim The Tool Man Taylor!

00:14.047 --> 00:16.413
Great. Thank you all. Hey!

00:16.516 --> 00:21.180
Whoo! Boy, nice audience.
Thank you, Heidi. Thank you, everyone.

00:21.254 --> 00:24.189
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
I am Tim The Tool Man Taylor.</i>

00:24.257 --> 00:27.920
But, of course, you know that.
That's probably why you tuned in.

00:27.994 --> 00:31.555
And you all know my assistant,
Al Borland. Give it up for Al here.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.065
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

00:35.135 --> 00:39.663
<i>As you might have noticed by our clever
sign, it is Hot Rod Week on Tool Time.</i>

00:39.739 --> 00:41.707
And we are just counting down the days

00:41.808 --> 00:44.936
when I finish
my '46 Ford convertible right here.

00:45.011 --> 00:48.071
We're calling this
our Countdown to Coolness.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.619
We never devote a week to my car.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.053
<i>That'd be exciting.
Tool Time salute to old station wagons.</i>

01:00.860 --> 01:03.795
- Can we get on with the first segment?
- Why don't we?

01:03.863 --> 01:07.128
There's been big historical moments
in all of television.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.930
Remember the first step on the moon?
Right in a...

01:10.003 --> 01:11.971
Oh, yuck!

01:13.473 --> 01:15.304
The Berlin Wall falling down.

01:15.375 --> 01:19.505
Those big bricks,
they hurt me, dude! Look out!

01:19.579 --> 01:24.539
But today we're gonna break all records
in the history of television.

01:24.617 --> 01:27.916
I'm gonna pick out the color
of my convertible top. Huh!

01:30.090 --> 01:34.857
So why don't we bring out the man who
will show Tim all of his color choices,

01:34.961 --> 01:38.829
auto design specialist,
George Sparky Henderson!

01:40.900 --> 01:43.061
- Hey, Al.
- Welcome to the show.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.262
- Thanks for coming, Sparky.
- Tim.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.865
It's an honor, your having me here
as part of this historic moment.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.206
Let's take a look at some colors.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.508
Love to, Tim.
We've got lots of samples here.

01:54.581 --> 01:58.677
But our wheel, thank you, Heidi,
is going to help determine

01:58.751 --> 02:01.584
what is the best color
for the top of your car.

02:01.654 --> 02:07.615
Now, we have here the color that you've
used for the exterior, a ruby pearl.

02:07.694 --> 02:10.253
- Excellent choice, Tim.
- Well, yes.

02:10.363 --> 02:15.858
Then the interior, Tim. You chose Rhone,
so we line up these two colors,

02:15.935 --> 02:20.872
and then the inner wheel will show which
color will best complement these two.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.967
- The burgundy's awfully tasteful.
- Wrong!

02:26.079 --> 02:28.843
Now, you have
an awful lot of options here, Tim.

02:28.948 --> 02:31.883
Stop right there.
I think I know exactly what I want.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.283
You still haven't seen
all of your options.

02:34.354 --> 02:37.016
Once I make a decision, Al,
I've made my decision.

02:37.090 --> 02:40.253
That's right, Al.
When a man sees something, he buys it.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.523
- That's it. Case closed.
- Not like a woman buying a purse.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.565
"I don't know.
Does this go with my house?"

02:46.633 --> 02:49.158
All right.
So what color are you going with?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.396
I'm gonna go with...

02:51.471 --> 02:54.440
Klaus, a drum roll, please.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.873
I'm gonna go with honky.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.108
- Honky?
- White.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.114
Oh, white, white. Yes.

03:02.182 --> 03:07.449
I get that. White.
Well, now, that's a very bold choice.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.488
But tan is very nice.

03:09.589 --> 03:14.117
No, no. Absolutely positively
going with white... or beige.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.924
So much for a man
being able to make up his mind.

03:16.996 --> 03:20.056
Well, you have an awful lot of beiges
to choose from.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.567
Ecru. Now, there's a fun beige, hm?

03:22.635 --> 03:25.536
- Let's not forget eggshell.
- Oh, I love eggshell.

03:25.605 --> 03:29.473
- Snappy, snappy, snappy.
- What do you think about cashew?

03:29.542 --> 03:33.774
Al, we're talking about convertible
tops, not what you store for the winter.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.731 --> 04:28.861
Sparky asked me to call. We're looking
for a fabric for a new convertible top.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.199
Well, is Big Jim there?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.831
How about Spanish Bob?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.465
One-Eyed Ned?

04:36.542 --> 04:40.205
It sounds like
he's calling a pirate ship.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.077
Hi, guys.
You'll never guess what happened today.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.311
- You bought me a Ferrari.
- Even better.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.656
<i>I was asked to be on that talk show,
Talk to Me.</i>

04:50.757 --> 04:52.850
- I'm gonna be on television.
- Not now.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.383
I'm talking to One-Eyed Ned.
He's got a bum ear.

04:56.462 --> 05:00.626
No, no, no! I have no gum in my rear!

05:00.733 --> 05:04.294
Look, when Big Jim comes,
just have him call me. Thanks.

05:05.171 --> 05:09.039
Now, what do you wanna...?! What
would you like to watch on television?

05:09.108 --> 05:11.133
No, I'm gonna be on television.

05:11.210 --> 05:13.371
Did you witness a crime or something?

05:13.446 --> 05:16.506
No. I'm gonna be
on Barbara Canfield's talk show.

05:16.582 --> 05:19.415
<i>This particular segment is called
Women on Top.</i>

05:19.485 --> 05:21.749
I rented that once.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.783
It's about professional women
who want it all.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.292
That's the one.

05:28.361 --> 05:32.263
- OK, I won't bore you with the details.
- Come on. Tell us all the details.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.495
- How much are they paying you?
- I'm not doing this for money.

05:35.568 --> 05:39.595
This is an honor. I'm gonna be on a
panel with two very distinguished women.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.300
One's an economist.
The other one's a doctor.

05:42.375 --> 05:47.711
Wow. You really balance out the group.
Part-time student with no income.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.914
The chairman of the psychology
department recommended me.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.316
They wanted somebody
who'd raised a family

05:54.387 --> 05:56.651
and is about to re-enter the work force.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.987
That is great. What do you think, guys?

05:59.058 --> 06:02.494
- Yeah, it's cool. Whers the show?
- Four o'clock tomorrow.

06:02.562 --> 06:06.931
Oh, too bad. I gotta go with Sparky
to check out some car colors.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.001
It's very important.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.137
Well, what am I thinking?

06:12.238 --> 06:16.572
Not as important as watching my wife
on a show talking about womers issues.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.408
- What are you writing, Benny?
- A birthday note to my mom.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.452
How do you spell I.O.U.?

06:28.488 --> 06:31.013
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Timmy.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.058
Oh, Tim, what's it gonna be?

06:33.159 --> 06:36.595
- The dusty sand or the sandy beach?
- What's going on?

06:36.662 --> 06:39.631
We've been all over town
fabric shopping.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.892
For my top.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.130
I always saw you in a slinky
off-the-shoulder number.

06:45.271 --> 06:48.399
Convertible top for my car, you idiot.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.567
You thought of a toasted marshmallow?

06:50.643 --> 06:52.611
Not as often as you have, Al.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.875
I'm late for my step-aerobics class.
I'll leave this here.

06:55.948 --> 06:58.280
Make a decision.
I'll be back in a half an hour.

06:58.351 --> 07:01.081
So, Tim, we haven't seen
much of you lately.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.452
Should I take that personally?

07:03.523 --> 07:07.050
Yes. I'm working really hard
on my hot rod.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.492
I was trying to get this thing done
by Friday.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.962
You must have been busy. You haven't
spent any money here in weeks.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.865
I had to cancel my trip to Hawaii.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.200
I just talked to Dolores.
She didn't say anything about a trip.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.298
Dolores wasrt invited.

07:22.375 --> 07:27.278
Besides, she's on her own vacation.
She's scaring the bulls in Pamplona.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.178
Oh, man. Look at the time.
I'm supposed to watch Jill on TV.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.745
- Tell Sparky I'll be back in an hour.
- Hey, watch it here.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.485
- Hey, good idea.
- What's she doing?

07:39.559 --> 07:43.518
<i>She's on that talk show, Talk to Me.
The segment's called Women on Top.</i>

07:43.629 --> 07:46.928
That was a video, wasrt it?

07:53.339 --> 07:57.002
<i>And welcome to Talk to Me.
Today's topic is Women on Top.</i>

07:57.076 --> 07:59.374
<i>We'll meet women
who had it all, gave it up,</i>

07:59.445 --> 08:02.005
<i>got it back,
and are doing it better than ever.</i>

08:02.081 --> 08:05.141
This looks good.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.346
My guests today are Kathleen
Fitzsimmons, mother of two,

08:08.421 --> 08:11.117
now an economist with Allied Bank.

08:11.190 --> 08:15.923
Jill Taylor, mother of three, just about
to complete her masters in psychology.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.761
And Dr. Diane Peck,
mother of two, now a pediatrician.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.801
This reminds me
of my first appearance on TV.

08:22.869 --> 08:26.134
Yeah, when you set your hair on fire.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.169
My first question is
how did your husbands react

08:30.243 --> 08:33.804
when you told them you were going to
re-enter the work force? Diane?

08:33.913 --> 08:38.679
It's amazing. I get a job with one
of the top pediatric groups in Detroit

08:38.784 --> 08:42.948
and all my husband could say was,
"Who's gonna cook for me?"

08:43.054 --> 08:45.888
What's wrong with that?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.222
Jill, how did your husband react

08:48.294 --> 08:51.058
when you told him
you were going back to school?

08:51.130 --> 08:52.290
Tim?

08:52.398 --> 08:54.525
If that's your husband.

08:55.234 --> 09:00.934
Well, as memory serves,
he was very supportive.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.033
Boy, I wish I had a husband like yours.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.738
- Mine's a total caveman.
- Mine, too.

09:06.812 --> 09:11.374
When I told him I wanted my own career,
he couldn't even articulate words.

09:11.484 --> 09:15.750
He just kind of went...

09:18.457 --> 09:22.553
- How did you know that?
- Lucky guess.

09:22.628 --> 09:26.860
What kind of dirt you got on Jill?
She's making you look good.

09:26.933 --> 09:32.098
What do you think it would take
for me to get a date with the host?

09:32.171 --> 09:34.935
A miracle not even God could pull off.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.377
Jill, you're the psychologist.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.446
What is going on under the surface
with these guys?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.745
Well, it's very common.
Often a man feels threatened

09:44.817 --> 09:47.911
when a woman usurps his role
as hunter-gatherer.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.615
That's why their husbands
reacted the way they did.

09:50.690 --> 09:54.182
Why is your husband so understanding,
the exception to the rule?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.991
Well, Tim is one of a kind.
I mean, Tim breaks all the rules.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.032
Tim breaks everything.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.970
Upon closer inspection,
Jill's looking...

10:07.073 --> 10:09.041
Hey! Hey!

10:10.843 --> 10:14.711
You're very lucky to have a husband
who's made the transition easier.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.682
I wish my experience had been
a walk in the park like Jill's.

10:18.751 --> 10:19.911
It wasrt exactly...

10:19.986 --> 10:24.218
In a perfect world, I guess we'd all be
skipping through life like Jill.

10:24.290 --> 10:28.659
I'm not skipping through life. I mean,
I've struggled like the rest of you.

10:28.761 --> 10:33.027
Believe me,
my husband is far from perfect.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.601
Look out. Incoming.

10:37.503 --> 10:41.769
What did your husband say when you told
him you wanted to be a psychologist?

10:41.841 --> 10:44.401
- His exact words?
- Yeah.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.776
"What for? You should
become a turret lathe operator."

10:48.848 --> 10:52.215
- Yeah.
- They make good money!

10:52.284 --> 10:54.445
I never talk to him
about what I'm studying.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.612
He thinks psychology is totally bogus.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.021
- So you must be pretty resentful.
- Oh, no.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.618
Don't misconstrue what I'm saying
as anger towards my husband.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.994
I could never be angry at a man

11:06.065 --> 11:09.501
who's in such a vulnerable state.

11:13.773 --> 11:17.209
Exactly what do you mean
by a vulnerable state?

11:17.276 --> 11:20.541
Well, he's in mid-life crisis.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.071
I mean, he's emotionally fragile.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.914
Oh, you poor hunter-gatherer, you.

11:31.290 --> 11:34.453
Let me get you a tissue.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.528
Would a hug help?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.360
It's really wonderful
that you can be so empathetic.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.163
Well, I have to be.
Tim is emotionally off-center.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.796
He's... crying out for help.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.874
Hey, you guys hear something?

11:51.944 --> 11:54.310
Help! Help!

11:56.482 --> 12:00.179
It's very interesting
the way that this manifests itself.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.412
Tell us.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.818
He comes up
with all kinds of crazy ideas.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.517
He wanted to buy
and move up to a hunting lodge.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.856
- With the kids? The whole family?
- Yeah.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.796
- And he wanted to fly into outer space.
- Oh, now, that is crazy.

12:12.865 --> 12:17.234
In the middle of writing
my masters thesis,

12:17.303 --> 12:20.363
he decided he wanted
to have another baby.

12:20.439 --> 12:24.535
- At your age? That's a lot of nerve.
- Oh, you poor thing.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.841
No, no, no, no, wait.
No, he's the one that's suffering.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.405
That's why it is so important
for me to listen to all of his ideas,

12:31.484 --> 12:33.975
no matter how stupid or pathetic.

12:34.053 --> 12:38.387
I think we should give a big hand
to the woman who has it all

12:38.457 --> 12:42.325
in spite of the man who wants
to take it away and keep it for himself.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.798
That went well.

12:53.873 --> 12:56.137
Man, Dolores rags on me,

12:56.208 --> 12:59.575
but it's in the privacy
of a bowling alley.

12:59.678 --> 13:02.010
At least this is on
late in the afternoon.

13:02.081 --> 13:06.609
Who's gonna watch the stupid thing?
Eight people watch this damn thing.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.653
- Tim.
- What is it?

13:08.754 --> 13:11.314
I saw what Jill said about you
on the TV.

13:11.390 --> 13:15.850
- Where?
- The guys in the gym felt your pain.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.897
A lot of them tried to cover up
by laughing.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.992
Were you one of them, Sparky?

13:23.068 --> 13:25.036
I'd rather not say.

13:39.385 --> 13:44.049
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Mom. Great job on the show.

13:44.123 --> 13:49.060
Really? So you don't think
that I went overboard?

13:49.128 --> 13:54.225
Well, it's hard to say. Why don't you
ask your stupid, pathetic husband?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.559
Is he upset?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.695
Never came home to watch the show.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.935
- Oh, thank God.
- We taped it. You want us to hide it?

14:03.042 --> 14:05.101
No, I want you to burn it.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.380
Hello, Jill.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.719
Goodbye, Mom.

14:19.191 --> 14:23.321
So I heard that you never made it home
to watch the show.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.056
No, I didn't make it home.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.360
That's OK.
It was really not interesting.

14:27.433 --> 14:28.764
- You don't think?
- No.

14:28.834 --> 14:32.531
I was able to catch it at the hardware
store in front of all my friends.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.565
How are they doing? You know,
I really have been missing Benny.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.612
Benny's really great.
He's been laughing a lot lately.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.681
They've all been laughing a lot.

14:42.781 --> 14:45.443
They thought your performance
was really funny.

14:45.517 --> 14:49.613
<i>You should remember some of the things
you've said on Tool Time about women.</i>

14:49.688 --> 14:52.452
Such as women aren't decisive,

14:52.524 --> 14:55.823
uh, my wife this, my wife that.

14:56.929 --> 14:59.489
<i>I am paid to be a character
on Tool Time.</i>

14:59.565 --> 15:03.126
Your character just happens to be
married to a character named Jill?

15:03.202 --> 15:05.534
Jill's a very common name.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.200
The Jill you said drools in her sleep

15:09.308 --> 15:12.402
and the Jill you said
had bad morning breath was this Jill.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.912
The only two times
I've mentioned your name.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.438
You said I was suffering
a mid-life crisis, told everybody that,

15:18.517 --> 15:20.678
that it was stupid
to want another child.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.346
You called me fragile.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.188
I was just trying to get a psychological
perspective on men in general.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.318
I didn't mean you.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.454
The only one you mentioned was me.

15:31.530 --> 15:36.263
I wasrt talking about you specifically.
I was referring to the global you.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.065
- Oh, yeah. The global me.
- Yeah.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.904
Well, now the global me
is walking around without any globes.

15:46.578 --> 15:50.207
<i>That's why it's so important
that I listen to all of his ideas,</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.842
<i>no matter how stupid or pathetic.</i>

15:55.554 --> 15:59.513
<i>...that I listen to all of his ideas,
no matter how stupid or pathetic.</i>

16:00.793 --> 16:03.091
What was I thinking?

16:03.162 --> 16:05.130
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

16:12.805 --> 16:15.171
Wilson, is that you?

16:15.240 --> 16:19.609
Oh! I am so sorry, neighborette.
Good thing I wasrt juggling chain saws.

16:19.678 --> 16:21.043
Yeah.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.775
- I didn't know you juggled.
- Oh, yes, indeedy.

16:23.849 --> 16:27.683
I'm a little bit rusty.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.051
But in my younger days...

16:31.790 --> 16:33.758
I worked in the circus.

16:35.394 --> 16:37.692
I roomed with a two-headed man.

16:37.763 --> 16:40.630
Did you split the utilities three ways?

16:40.699 --> 16:41.996
No, five ways.

16:42.067 --> 16:46.436
We also lived with Nicky The Lobster Boy
and Margo The Human Corkscrew.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.837
I'm rooming with
Tim The Ticked-Off Tool Man.

16:49.908 --> 16:53.241
I was on a talk show and I said
some things I shouldn't have said.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.542
<i>Well, Tim's done that to you
on Tool Time.</i>

16:55.614 --> 16:59.175
Yeah, but I said
that he was stupid and pathetic.

16:59.284 --> 17:02.344
Oh, my, my, my!
What caused you to do that?

17:02.421 --> 17:05.720
I don't know. All these women
were trashing their husbands.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.921
And I didn't wanna do that, you know.
I wanted to explain Tim's behavior.

17:09.994 --> 17:12.054
Well, who were these women?

17:12.131 --> 17:14.656
They were very successful
professional women.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.098
One was a doctor.
The other was an economist.

17:17.169 --> 17:19.603
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

17:19.671 --> 17:22.231
Oh, I see what you're saying.

17:25.676 --> 17:28.111
All I said was,
"Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm."

17:28.180 --> 17:30.614
But what you meant
was that I was analyzing Tim

17:30.682 --> 17:33.150
was because I was insecure
around these women

17:33.218 --> 17:36.244
and needed to show off
how much I knew about psychology.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.687
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.850
You make another good point.

17:42.561 --> 17:46.691
I mean, I was validated for what I said,
so I went on and on and on and on.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.393
Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.469
I sold Tim out to make myself look good.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.598
Mm.

17:55.674 --> 17:59.542
Wow. You're really tough on me
sometimes, Wilson.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.307
But you don't make me feel judged.
You know?

18:05.384 --> 18:08.012
You are just a genius.
How do you do that?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.419
I just tell it like it is.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.390
- Hi.
- Hi there.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.695
How are you doing?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.497
Not as good as the woman
that had it all, got it back,

18:24.570 --> 18:27.403
dumped it on the ground
and rubbed my nose in it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.667
What's all this?

18:31.777 --> 18:33.938
I know I shouldn't have said what I did,

18:34.046 --> 18:37.504
so I cooked your favorite meal
as a sort of peace offering.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.348
Hm. Bratwurst, knackwurst.

18:42.421 --> 18:46.482
And as an appetizer, liverwurst.

18:46.558 --> 18:50.221
I guess you could say
this is my "wurst" meal.

18:51.563 --> 18:55.021
- I say that about all your meals.
- Yeah, I know.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.331
I didn't mean to talk
about our private life on television.

18:58.403 --> 19:01.770
I guess once I got surrounded
by all those successful women,

19:01.840 --> 19:05.742
my self-esteem issues were triggered
and I wanted to impress them.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.644
- So I overcompensated by...
- Honey, honey, honey.

19:08.714 --> 19:11.683
Back the Freud Fairlane up here.

19:11.783 --> 19:15.344
You got carried away. You were trying
to show off for the girls.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.322
- I was the butt of your tirade.
- Yeah, that's right. You got it.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.690
<i>I do it all the time on Tool Time.
Now I know how you feel.</i>

19:24.663 --> 19:27.223
So you're not gonna
hold this against me?

19:27.299 --> 19:31.736
No, I'm a guy. I let this stuff go.
I do wanna ask one thing, though.

19:31.803 --> 19:36.103
Are you ticked off at me for making you
go through this mid-life thing?

19:36.175 --> 19:39.941
Sometimes it is hard for me to keep up
with the changes you're making.

19:40.012 --> 19:44.847
But I love that you're experiencing new
emotions you never thought you'd have.

19:44.917 --> 19:50.150
I hate new emotions.
I hate all emotions.

19:50.222 --> 19:54.249
It did make me appreciate
what you have to go through every day.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.658
What? Being married to you?

19:57.863 --> 20:01.959
Being in front of the camera, putting it
out there in front of everybody.

20:02.034 --> 20:06.198
- How do you get over being nervous?
- There's a little thing I do to relax.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.773
I... I make fun of women.

20:13.245 --> 20:16.681
It's spring again, the time
when a young mars fancy turns to...

20:16.748 --> 20:19.046
Cheese!

20:19.117 --> 20:22.678
That's right. And check out Saginaw's
new line of spring cheeses.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.383
When it's springtime, it's string time.

20:26.458 --> 20:31.589
Sparky, pull me off a little bit
of that string cheese. Saginaw Cheese.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.631
Cheese, it's good!

20:39.404 --> 20:42.168
<i>Welcome back to Tool Time.
It's that magic moment.</i>

20:42.274 --> 20:46.233
That's right. We're about to reveal
Tim's completed hot rod.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.350
Oh, thank God. I can't wait.

20:55.420 --> 20:58.184
I've never seen you this excited
about a car before.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.623
I'm excited
because it's finally finished.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.388
Yeah, we can get our lives back.

21:03.462 --> 21:07.023
If I were you,
I'd go with a whole new one.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.964
OK, on three, we're going to reveal

21:09.034 --> 21:12.526
Tim's totally tricked-out
'46 Ford convertible!

21:12.604 --> 21:16.973
Everybody... One! Two! Three!

21:17.042 --> 21:19.010
- Yeah!
- All right!

21:23.582 --> 21:27.074
Hey, Tim,
there's no upholstery, nothing.

21:27.152 --> 21:29.120
You were supposed to finish this.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.189
After we changed the color of the top,

21:31.290 --> 21:34.748
the seats didn't match,
neither did the side panels.

21:34.826 --> 21:38.057
The maroon didn't match the rim,
so I'm gonna repaint that.

21:38.130 --> 21:42.430
- That's gonna take, like, three months.
- Oh, yeah.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.265
Oh, no.

21:49.007 --> 21:52.568
Klaus, drum roll, please.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.274
- Funny color, Tim?
- It's a funny color.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.817
That Jill was this Jill.

21:59.885 --> 22:04.447
The only two times I've ever mentioned
your names were that time...

22:04.523 --> 22:07.651
How are they? I've been missing Benny.

22:10.195 --> 22:14.029
In my younger days,
I worked in the circus.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.067
Ah!
