20:12.367 --> 20:14.400
I AM NOT A GEEZER.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.233
I'M A COLORFUL
OUTDOORSMAN.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.767

20:32.700 --> 20:35.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU PRETENDED
TO FIND THIS FOOD IN THE WILD.

20:35.600 --> 20:40.367
TROOPER CODY, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO STRIP YOU
OF YOUR KOALA STATUS.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.867

20:48.600 --> 20:50.500
HEY. AREN'T YOU COMING?

20:50.500 --> 20:54.767

20:54.767 --> 20:57.400

20:57.400 --> 21:01.100
YEAH, I KNOW.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.000
WHY?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.300
BECAUSE YOU'RE
MR. JUNGLE GUY,

21:05.300 --> 21:07.400

AND BRINGING HOME FISH.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.300
AND I'M JUST AN EGGHEAD
NERD WHO'S AFRAID
OF A BEARCOON.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.133
SO YOU WERE JEALOUS OF ME.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.600
WELL, YOU DID SO WELL
IN THE WOODS,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.233
AND I DID NOTHING
BUT CHEAT.

21:17.233 --> 21:19.367
MAN, YOU'RE HARD ON YOURSELF.

21:19.367 --> 21:21.900
YOU KNOW, I NEVER WOULD HAVE
FOUND OUT WHAT KIND
OF CAMPER I WAS

21:21.900 --> 21:23.800
UNLESS YOU STARTED
THIS TROOP.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.200
GOOD POINT.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.367
SO, WHEN I SCREW UP,
I MOVE ON.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.500
FORGIVE AND FORGET,
THAT'S MY MOTTO.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.967
COME ON.

AT MERLE'S CABIN.

21:34.967 --> 21:36.934

BABY-SIT FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

21:51.767 --> 21:54.000

21:54.000 --> 21:57.467
OUT OF TOWN?
WHERE WOULD SHE GO?

21:57.467 --> 22:00.400
OH, THAT'S IT.
HOLD THAT POSE!

22:02.567 --> 22:06.367
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
A KISS FROM A WOMAN

22:06.367 --> 22:09.567
IN A LONG TIME.

22:09.567 --> 22:12.500
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.400
OH, OK.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.367
WORKS FOR ME.
