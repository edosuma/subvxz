00:06.473 --> 00:09.044
In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.109 --> 00:11.180
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:11.245 --> 00:14.089
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.956
These are their stories.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.062
I don't know what you expect me to say.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.031
I want an explanation.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.762
I'm getting calls from Mr. Tyler every day.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.431
Obviously, there's been a mix-up.

00:28.328 --> 00:29.534
Obviously.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.007
Mr. Hagman, the florist is here.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.566
He's got a couple of questions for you.

00:32.633 --> 00:36.206
Thank you, Mr. Rivera. You have
the weekend to straighten this out.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.139
If I hadn't happened to check.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.741
It's just a mix-up.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.288
What am I gonna tell him come Monday?

00:45.345 --> 00:47.347
Part of being a successful businessman

00:47.414 --> 00:49.553
is knowing when to worry and when not to.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.527
- He's gonna make trouble, I know it.
- No, he's not.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.826
He doesn't want the publicity.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.334
Appearances count, Russell.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.808
All I'm saying is, this could
be a big problem for me.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.040
- I got to catch the ferry back.
- Russell,

01:09.770 --> 01:12.683
problems are just solutions in work clothes.

What are you doing in here?

01:30.123 --> 01:32.262
You know you're not supposed to be here alone.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.999
Sorry, Mr. H.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.631
We got Mr. Knowles on deck.

01:35.696 --> 01:39.542
His chart says he died
from cirrhosis of the liver.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.580
That's drinking, right?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.248
Scotty, why don't you go home tonight?

01:44.304 --> 01:45.908
Mr. H, I was...

01:46.106 --> 01:48.347
We'll talk about it next week.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.046
You just go home.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.153
Tell your mother Happy Easter.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.460
(phone ringing)

02:05.359 --> 02:07.134
Hi. They all asleep?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.733
No, not yet.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.709
I wanna finish up Mr. Knowles' body tonight.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.877
The viewing's at noon.

02:15.268 --> 02:16.941
No, don't wait up.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.406
Love you, too.

02:20.273 --> 02:21.650
Hey, Doug.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.517
Long time, no see.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.380
Do I know you?

02:56.343 --> 02:58.380
How's my Easter Bunny?

02:58.445 --> 03:00.584
You got in late last night.

03:00.647 --> 03:03.423
I know. The traffic was backed
up all the way to Melwood.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.156
You work too hard.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.667
Do you know what happens to
little boys who work too hard?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.998
Look what the Easter Bunny brought!

03:11.058 --> 03:13.561
(exclaiming)
Look at all that candy.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.506
Hey, I bet there's more.

03:16.563 --> 03:19.407
Who wants to go on an Easter egg hunt?

03:19.466 --> 03:21.446
Both: Me! Me!

03:21.935 --> 03:24.040
Start looking.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.013
(growling)

03:30.777 --> 03:33.223
Douglas, are you back here?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.027
Oh, God.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.521
Oh, my God.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.846
Crucifixion pose.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.353
No characteristic mutilation.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.723
No nail holes. No crown of thorns.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.254
Just these.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.024
His wife said he didn't
have a medical condition.

04:49.489 --> 04:52.698
You must've been so much
fun in biology class.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.632
(COPS CHATTERING)

04:56.196 --> 05:00.338
Actually, my biology teacher, Mr. Dixon,
didn't think I was much fun at all.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.041
There was no sign of forced entry.

05:04.104 --> 05:08.143
There's only one employee
with a key, Mr. Rivera.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.321
He's been with Hagman for 11 years.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.653
There's something floating
in the embalming fluid.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.077
It's a marijuana seed.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.715
Hagman had this kid working
for him. Scotty Calderon.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.155
Yeah, my mom was a cosmetician for Mr. H.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.784
She got sick, so he lets me work part-time,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.124
you know, showing me the ropes.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.496
I'm sure you could show him
a few ropes yourself.

05:54.721 --> 05:57.395
Like the many profitable uses

05:57.457 --> 05:59.960
for embalming fluid.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.503
I don't know about that, man.

06:02.562 --> 06:07.136
You don't know about fry
sticks, clickums, wet daddies?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.308
Damn.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.144
Damn is right, Scotty.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.740
Joints soaked in embalming fluid

06:12.806 --> 06:15.047
sell for $20 bucks a pop on the street.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.579
Mr. H found out what you were doing?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.489
He didn't know about that, I swear.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.020
I just...

06:23.083 --> 06:24.960
He knew I was getting high.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.759
That's why he sent me home early last night.

06:26.820 --> 06:30.097
Early? His wife told us you
quit work every day at 6:00.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.430
Not the last couple of weeks.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.402
He had me stay late till he locks up.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.666
Why?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.838
I don't know, man.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.475
Well, anything unusual happen two weeks ago?

06:44.537 --> 06:47.017
Anything that had Mr. H worried?

06:47.474 --> 06:49.977
Well, there was that message
on the answering machine.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.216
Some guy was reading from the Bible.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.690
Well, do you remember what he said?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.285
Something about

06:57.751 --> 07:00.891
eating the bread, going back
in the ground, like that.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.326
(SCOTT LAUGHING)

07:02.389 --> 07:03.561
Okay, Scott.

07:04.724 --> 07:08.001
Just follow the officer out.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.574
So that's what a brain looks
like on embalming fluid.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.112
Hagman was getting harassing phone calls.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.675
"In the sweat of thy
face shalt thou eat bread,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.210
"till thou return unto the ground

07:22.275 --> 07:24.619
"for out of it wast thou taken."

07:24.711 --> 07:26.088
DEAKINS: Genesis.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.225
I need to use my most
important investigative tool.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.784
My library card.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.561
The ME analyzed the bumps on Hagman.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.129
They were filled with a
blend of mineral spirit,

07:38.191 --> 07:41.434
propylene glycol, surfactant, lanolin, aloe.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.236
You think that's some kind of soap?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.604
The lab's not sure.

07:44.664 --> 07:47.543
The bumps were made
post-mortem using a syringe.

07:47.600 --> 07:51.343
The skin was red from being
burned with a lighter or a torch.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.747
The Sixth Plague.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.884
Boils were the Sixth Plague
sent by God to the Egyptians.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.794
Each plague was meant to discredit

08:05.785 --> 08:07.765
a different Egyptian god.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.427
Boils were aimed at Imhotep,
the god of medicine.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.731
Hagman was killed by a religious fanatic?

08:12.792 --> 08:14.931
Yeah, who opposes embalming.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.037
Well, he's probably not the only
undertaker in town who was targeted.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.548
FRITZ: Ryan took the call.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.347
The person asked for me by my first name.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.580
Fritz.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.479
Was this someone you knew?

08:32.712 --> 08:34.623
I didn't recognize the voice.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.354
He had a whole spiel.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.953
Mostly about embalming
being against God's plan.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.867
How every time I insert a trocar
into a corpse, I desecrate the body.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.301
What's a trocar?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.804
Tool of the trade.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.738
It's inserted near the navel

08:49.796 --> 08:53.835
and used to puncture the stomach,
bladder, large intestines and lungs.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.744
Then... Let's leave it at tool of the trade.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.476
That was the term the caller used? Trocar?

09:00.807 --> 09:01.877
Yes.

09:02.609 --> 09:05.920
Mr. Vaughn, where did you
study for your license?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.749
Queens College of Mortuary Sciences.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.493
I was just about to go home.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.999
I just wanted to see how you were.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.831
Did you ever hear from that man, Hagman?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.962
- No. He was...
- I told you.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.299
Things have a way of working themselves out.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.774
Harry, he got killed over the weekend.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.469
Right in the funeral home.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.412
God has a very peculiar sense of humor.

09:30.136 --> 09:34.107
"Careers in advertising." What is all this?

09:34.207 --> 09:37.279
I got this idea on how to sell advertising.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.617
You know when you call up a
business and they put you on hold?

09:40.680 --> 09:43.889
What if instead of playing
music they played commercials?

09:43.950 --> 09:46.954
See, this is where companies get into trouble.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.096
They squander all their capital
by extending themselves

09:50.156 --> 09:53.797
into areas where they have no
track record, no expertise.

09:54.060 --> 09:58.338
Stop dreaming and start reaping.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.511
I'm going to take a look out back.

10:00.567 --> 10:04.344
Out back? Well, why? Is there a problem?

10:04.904 --> 10:06.679
No problem yet, Russell.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.344
I wanted to offer comfort
to the grief-stricken.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.481
The mortuary college was teaching us

10:12.545 --> 10:14.582
to shake every dime loose from them.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.183
- That's why you dropped out?
- Yes.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.320
And why you made threatening phone calls

10:18.384 --> 10:21.194
to your classmate Fritz
Vaughn and to Doug Hagman?

10:21.254 --> 10:24.326
I don't threaten. I call to open a dialogue.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.897
To rant against what your literature calls,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.999
"The ritual desecration of the human body."

10:31.064 --> 10:35.706
Do you have any idea what
embalming actually entails?

10:36.302 --> 10:39.715
Do you want your anus stuffed with cotton,

10:40.507 --> 10:42.544
your mouth glued shut,

10:43.510 --> 10:46.150
all to preserve the illusion that
death doesn't change anything?

10:46.212 --> 10:47.623
GOREN: Well, there's always cremation.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.853
No. Don't you understand?

10:50.216 --> 10:51.752
Death and decay

10:52.118 --> 10:55.725
are eternal truths of man's existence.

10:56.022 --> 10:58.764
Any interference, any desecration

10:59.392 --> 11:01.394
is a stain in God's plan.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.144
Any desecration at all of humans remains?

11:13.973 --> 11:15.077
Yes.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.055
He's a true believer.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.357
He wouldn't have desecrated Hagman's body.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.796
- Not even to make a point?
- You heard him.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.889
It would put a stain on God's plan.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.663
The fake boils, the crucifixion pose,

11:31.724 --> 11:33.294
it was all just to throw us off.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.532
- It's impressive.
- It's demented.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.869
It worked.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.001
Whoever it is killed Hagman,

11:39.065 --> 11:41.067
I can't wait to meet them.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.918
Mr. Hagman didn't mention any
problems with other funeral homes.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.924
What about your customers, Mr. Rivera.
You ever get any complaints from them?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.085
No. People are always grateful.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.787
Mr. Hagman did good work.

11:57.850 --> 12:02.162
There's a Mr. Tyler here who
doesn't sound very grateful.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.763
He's threatening a lawsuit.
Do you remember him?

12:05.825 --> 12:08.931
He brought in his wife and his mother
a couple of weeks ago for cremation,

12:08.995 --> 12:10.997
but I don't know of any trouble.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.876
GOREN: "if as you told me the ashes aren't
lost, then where the hell are they?

12:14.934 --> 12:17.744
"You have no idea what agony
you've put my family through.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.751
"if you don't return the ashes
by the end of this week,

12:20.807 --> 12:23.981
"you'll get a taste of
what we've had to endure."

12:25.578 --> 12:28.024
It's dated Tuesday, last week.

12:28.815 --> 12:31.227
Did you get him his ashes back?

12:31.918 --> 12:34.660
Well, I don't remember any paperwork about it.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.428
You do the cremations here?

12:36.489 --> 12:40.130
No, we send the remains to the Fox
Hills Crematory on Staten Island.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.136
Right. Tyler, poor guy
lost his wife and mother.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.433
He called here.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.571
I told him I sent the ashes back to Hagman's.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.206
You got any paperwork on that?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.375
Sure.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.755
"Problems are just solutions in work clothes."

12:58.811 --> 13:00.222
I like that.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.949
You had the business long?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.690
Couple of years, since my dad died.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.232
Family business. Interesting work?

13:09.956 --> 13:11.697
You get used to it.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.334
Burning bodies?

13:14.694 --> 13:18.232
Really? You know, I heard they
don't burn all the way through.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.440
You have to, you know, roll them
over like a log in a fireplace

13:23.136 --> 13:24.774
and shove them back in.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.043
It's called repositioning.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.879
And you get used to that?

13:32.278 --> 13:34.519
Yeah. You get used to anything.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.586
Here.

13:38.618 --> 13:42.896
Hagman's signature accepting receipt for
the urns containing the Tyler ashes.

13:42.955 --> 13:47.199
Can you think of any reason why Mr.
Hagman didn't return the ashes to Tyler?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.364
No.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.469
But, look, I don't mean to sound callous,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.135
I mean, the guy just lost his family,

13:53.199 --> 13:57.739
but on the phone, he was
ranting like some crazy man.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.589
He promised I'd get the ashes
back within three days.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.421
- He promised.
- So you threatened him.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.461
I told him I was gonna sue.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.224
To make sure he never did
business in this state again.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.558
Your mother lived with you?

14:17.623 --> 14:19.864
Yes, she wasn't in good health.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.774
She had a heart problem?

14:24.163 --> 14:28.168
She had an arrhythmia. It was
partially controlled by medication.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.208
Partially. She had a pacemaker?

14:31.270 --> 14:32.749
Yes, she did.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.786
Do you know if it was removed at the hospital

14:37.844 --> 14:39.881
before they sent her to the funeral home?

14:39.946 --> 14:41.482
I have no idea.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.786
What difference does it make?

14:45.184 --> 14:46.629
GOREN: The hospital didn't remove it

14:46.686 --> 14:48.165
before sending the body to the funeral home.

14:48.221 --> 14:51.100
Hagman's inventory of everything
he removed from Mrs. Tyler's body

14:51.157 --> 14:52.727
doesn't mention the pacemaker.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.533
And this is a big deal because?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.665
Pacemakers have to be
removed before cremation

14:56.729 --> 14:58.402
otherwise, the lithium batteries explode.

14:58.464 --> 15:02.276
Gives off a toxic fume and could
damage the cremation chamber.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.373
Yeah, I heard silicon
implants had to be removed.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.918
My buddy Martinelli in the
3-7 married a stripper.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.386
Did Mr. Matthews mention any
problems with Mrs. Tyler?

15:10.443 --> 15:11.615
No. You'd think he'd remember

15:11.677 --> 15:13.213
if she exploded in his furnace.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.488
Maybe the pacemaker popped out
in the accident or the hospital.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.522
Do we have a list of Hagman's clients

15:18.584 --> 15:20.825
who were cremated at Fox Hills?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.067
I ironed your gray shirt.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.377
I worry about you driving at night.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.804
Don't.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.745
I'm careful.

15:38.070 --> 15:41.210
I'll call you from the motel
as soon as I get there. Okay.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.178
My clients need to see me.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.417
They like the personal contact.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.454
I know you do, too.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.830
Oh, I almost forgot. Molly made
you some cookies for the road.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.198
I found only one family who would let
me examine their relative's ashes.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.400
Their Aunt Edith.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.377
She was cremated six months ago at Fox Hills.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.912
I ran the test twice, just to be sure.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.006
These so-called ashes are nothing but debris.

16:12.071 --> 16:13.311
Debris?

16:13.506 --> 16:17.283
Cement dust, dried clay, bits of
charcoal briquettes, wood chips.

16:17.343 --> 16:18.617
Nothing human?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.055
Not a spec.

16:20.279 --> 16:24.284
Just an urn filled with three pounds of dirt.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.962
So, where's Aunt Edith?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.831
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

16:29.889 --> 16:32.995
Detectives, I didn't expect to see you back.

16:33.059 --> 16:36.336
Couple of things came up in
connection with Damon Tyler.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.376
Did you run into any problems
when you cremated his mother?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.207
No. Why?

16:41.267 --> 16:43.838
It came to our attention she had a pacemaker.

16:43.903 --> 16:47.009
Oh, well, that would've been
removed before we got the remains.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.781
That's the problem. See, there's no record

16:49.842 --> 16:51.879
that it was removed by anybody.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.948
Well, if it hadn't been removed,

16:55.381 --> 16:57.759
I would've found out the hard way.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.353
It's a slow day.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.692
Excuse me?

17:00.753 --> 17:03.427
There's no smoke coming from the chimney.

17:03.489 --> 17:08.233
Oh, well, we only run the cremation
chamber at specific times.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.031
When was the last time?

17:11.097 --> 17:12.440
Yesterday.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.742
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.548
Because there's birds nesting
directly downwind from the chimney.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.682
- Well, I don't know much about birds.
- Yeah.

17:24.743 --> 17:28.556
But you'd think with the smoke
they'd keep from nesting there.

17:29.348 --> 17:33.296
Well, like you said, you don't
know much about birds, so...

17:33.786 --> 17:35.629
But I like fresh air.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.998
Doesn't smell so fresh here.
What do you think?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.265
It's a little ripe.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.206
Well, Fresh Kills Landfill is not far.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.270
What's back there?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.445
It's just some land my dad
bought with the crematory.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.709
Hey, you think we could take a walk?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.350
You know, I'm real busy,

17:54.407 --> 17:58.549
and my insurance won't allow anybody
back there without me, so...

17:58.611 --> 18:00.818
So that's a no on the nature walk?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.358
Yeah. Sorry. It's...

18:02.415 --> 18:05.862
This is Goren. We're
at the Fox Hills Crematory.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.325
Right.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.736
The DA's will be faxing you a search warrant.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.335
MAN: We got two over by those rocks.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.875
Four, could be five down in that little gully.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.808
Some are buried deep.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.870
Some are just covered with branches.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.483
Some look a few weeks old, some...

18:27.540 --> 18:28.883
Who knows?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.222
Rough count so far is north of 30.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.796
I've never seen anything like this.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.988
You and me both, brother.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.633
Dad left a lot of debt.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.539
Like when he got the furnace fixed.

18:52.598 --> 18:53.872
So you saved on your gas bill

18:53.933 --> 18:56.106
by dumping bodies in your backyard?

18:56.168 --> 18:57.647
Is that where the $70,000

18:57.703 --> 18:59.842
we found in your bank account came from?

19:00.840 --> 19:04.310
It's just a mistake, I swear.
I never wanted this.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.550
You never wanted what?

19:07.680 --> 19:11.423
The crematory? Your dad's business?

19:11.484 --> 19:14.590
You had other plans for your life?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.367
You wanted to be what,

19:19.425 --> 19:21.666
an advertising executive?

19:22.428 --> 19:24.601
A webpage designer?

19:24.697 --> 19:28.406
Oh, and look at this, an alpaca rancher.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.775
Anything but a guy who repositions

19:32.838 --> 19:35.614
half-burnt corpses on the grill.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.624
This is what you buried back there.

19:42.515 --> 19:46.759
Your dreams. Your frustrated ambitions.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.730
That's why you defrauded these families.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.200
- That's what Hagman found out.
- No, no.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.998
I didn't... I didn't defraud anybody.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.199
Come on, Russell, take
some pride in your work.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.971
Look at the books that you kept.

19:59.031 --> 20:03.980
Every decimal in its place.
Every penny accounted for.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.513
You covered yourself like a pro.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.814
Where did you learn to do this?

20:10.476 --> 20:11.750
Nowhere.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.723
You went to business school?

20:13.779 --> 20:14.814
No.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.550
You had someone help you keep the books?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.328
No. No one.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.865
I don't need to do this
anymore. I want a lawyer.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.733
I want a lawyer, now.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.707
DEAKINS: I just got the
latest tally from the ME.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.904
They broke 100 about an hour ago.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.004
That's 100 counts of larceny.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.141
Not to mention, an innumerable
violations of the public health laws.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.585
But I'd trade it all for a
single count of murder.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.854
Matthews isn't sophisticated
enough to have pulled off

20:46.912 --> 20:49.051
Hagman's murder or this scam.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.088
He's a pie-in-the-sky dreamer

20:52.651 --> 20:55.393
with no practical experience in business.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.703
But his books and his records
would stand up to a tax audit.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.030
Does he have a bookkeeper?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.265
None we could find.

21:02.328 --> 21:03.568
GOREN: And it's not just that.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.542
It's marketing techniques,
the ads and the journals.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.045
It speaks to a professionalism

21:09.702 --> 21:11.875
that's well beyond his grasp.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.090
This kind of professionalism.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.854
"Problems are just solutions in work clothes"

21:23.783 --> 21:28.493
"Enthusiasm is the rocket fuel that
propels you up the ladder of success."

21:28.554 --> 21:30.363
"If you think you can, you can."

21:30.422 --> 21:33.699
Matthew's silent partner
is a motivational speaker?

21:34.527 --> 21:37.906
"Don't get what you want. Want what you get."

21:39.565 --> 21:42.307
It's M & H Consulting, Queens, New York.

21:46.672 --> 21:50.210
Russell is my cousin on my mother's side.

21:50.476 --> 21:55.084
He asked for my advice when he
took over Uncle Leon's business.

21:55.915 --> 21:57.656
So I instructed him

21:59.285 --> 22:02.425
on the basics, you know, a
little bookkeeping, marketing.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.899
He took your lessons to heart.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.563
He runs his business in a
very professional manner.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.942
Except in the one respect.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.805
Right. I don't know what got into him.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.642
Greed, for one thing.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.306
That's probably it.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.214
Well, greed only gets you so far.

22:22.074 --> 22:26.545
It takes a special kind of
callousness to do what Russell did.

22:27.980 --> 22:31.928
Russell never struck me as especially callous.

22:32.751 --> 22:36.198
You should see what it looks
like behind his crematory.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.337
Half-buried, bloated corpses,

22:42.094 --> 22:46.668
crawling with vermin,
rotting entrails seeping out,

22:48.367 --> 22:50.973
bodies piled one on top of the other,

22:51.570 --> 22:54.915
flesh decaying into each other like a...

23:00.179 --> 23:01.920
Like a putrid soup.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.566
Of course,

23:13.759 --> 23:16.296
those people were dead to begin with.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.803
Like I said, I don't know what got into him.

23:19.865 --> 23:23.244
Harry, lunch is ready.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.949
They're detectives.
They're asking about Russell.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.543
Be right there.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.521
That's my wife.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.153
You didn't need her, did you?

23:38.284 --> 23:39.820
- No.
- I didn't think so.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.599
This is a terrific little
workshop you have here.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.406
It's the one thing I miss
about being in the city.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.376
No room for a workshop.

23:56.936 --> 24:01.146
No room to, I don't know,
get away from the family.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.981
Well, I don't look to get
away from the family.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.350
Oh, jeez.

24:09.014 --> 24:10.584
Do you mind?

24:12.418 --> 24:13.522
Well,

24:15.387 --> 24:17.993
we'll let you get back to your family.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.968
Thanks for giving us your time, Mr. Rowan.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.371
You okay?

24:27.433 --> 24:29.845
I need to get my hands to the lab.

24:31.036 --> 24:33.038
The lab sent me their analysis

24:33.105 --> 24:35.051
of the clean-up goop from your hands.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.214
It has the same chemical composition

24:37.276 --> 24:39.654
as the fluid found in the boils on Hagman.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.056
Not a conclusive match but
well within the hash marks.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.391
How about that. Not only does Mr.
Harry Rowan have a green thumb,

24:45.451 --> 24:47.397
he has an aptitude for murder.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.460
I think he does it for a living.

24:50.522 --> 24:53.867
His lifestyle, his personality,

24:56.095 --> 24:59.941
his obsessive concentration
on the task at hand.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.480
It fits the profile.

25:03.535 --> 25:07.176
So why is a professional hitman
interested in a crematory?

25:07.239 --> 25:09.276
Well, I'd like to say
he was cremating his victims,

25:09.341 --> 25:11.446
but there's no cremation going on.

25:14.446 --> 25:18.258
You're cataloging the DNA from the crematory?

25:18.917 --> 25:20.328
Of course.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.896
Could you start running it
through the national database?

25:29.628 --> 25:31.073
EAMES: Albert Lundy.

25:31.130 --> 25:35.340
His remains were found buried behind the
crematory and identified through DNA.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.745
He died in October last year.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.840
Which is odd because his DNA

25:39.905 --> 25:43.443
matched the DNA found at a murder
scene in Brooklyn three months ago,

25:43.509 --> 25:45.511
under the fingernails of the victim.

25:45.577 --> 25:49.286
Lyle Curicelli. He was
found strangled in an alley.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.727
Curicelli was in debt to the Masucci family.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.765
His murder was a suspected hit.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.357
The skin samples and the DNA
found under his fingernails

25:57.423 --> 25:59.164
were thought to belong to his assailant.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.897
The DNA belonging to Grandpa Lundy?

26:00.959 --> 26:02.131
GOREN: Right.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.764
Next we have Kenneth Hemmerick.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.105
Mr. Hemmerick died in June, 1999.

26:06.165 --> 26:09.009
His DNA turned up in a
blood sample from Newark,

26:09.068 --> 26:12.072
on the body of a bookie James Hurly.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.516
Mr. Hurly was stabbed to
death in January, 2000.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.451
Another suspected Masucci hit.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.614
We found 4 more bodies behind the crematory

26:19.678 --> 26:21.783
whose DNA turned up at Masucci hits.

26:21.847 --> 26:26.318
The DNA from the crematory was
harvested from those remains

26:26.385 --> 26:28.763
and then planted on these victims

26:28.821 --> 26:31.301
to mislead the murder investigators

26:31.356 --> 26:34.963
and create reasonable doubt
in the event of a trial.

26:36.161 --> 26:39.904
Harvested and planted by Harry Rowan.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.005
That's our theory.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.613
In the past, the Masuccis
have used two known hitmen.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.081
Frank Curtis,

26:46.171 --> 26:48.947
he's been in federal custody
for a year and a half

26:49.007 --> 26:50.315
and Eddie Ferguson.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.321
He's been missing for the last 6 months,

26:52.377 --> 26:55.620
presumed to be in hiding or to
have fled the jurisdiction.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.883
So Harry picked up the slack.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.659
Well, we don't think he works
exclusively for the Masuccis.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.893
There's a lot of blood on his hands.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.739
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.045
What are you doing out here?

27:21.106 --> 27:23.279
Mommy said we need more ice cream.

27:23.342 --> 27:26.255
Ice cream? What do we got in here?

27:26.311 --> 27:27.654
Chocolate!

27:29.448 --> 27:32.327
Or there's Rocky Road.

27:32.384 --> 27:33.454
(GIGGLING)

27:33.519 --> 27:34.554
What do you think?

27:34.620 --> 27:35.963
Chocolate.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.069
Chocolate it is.

27:40.859 --> 27:42.133
(GROWLING)

28:08.387 --> 28:10.731
NUNEZ: We got an anonymous phone call
from a concerned jogger.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.132
He said he saw two guys last week

28:12.191 --> 28:13.727
arguing on the Roosevelt Boardwalk.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.898
A couple of days ago, he recognized one
of them from his picture in the papers.

28:16.962 --> 28:19.442
Russell Matthews. He said
the other guy had a goatee.

28:19.498 --> 28:20.704
So we took a look.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.370
Guess what we found caught between the rocks?

28:22.434 --> 28:23.777
Eddie Ferguson.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.314
NUNEZ: Fingerprints confirmed it.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.680
Dead of blunt force trauma to the head.

28:27.906 --> 28:28.941
That's not all.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.647
There were hairs caught
under his fingernails.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.213
Same coloration as Russell Matthews.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.259
I obtained a hair sample from Mr. Matthews.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.317
- The hairs matched?
- Yes.

28:38.850 --> 28:41.956
Well, he looks well-preserved.
How long's he been dead?

28:42.020 --> 28:44.398
Without a full autopsy, it's hard to tell.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.129
I'd say a week or two.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.364
I heard Major Case was
looking for a Masucci hitman

28:48.427 --> 28:51.374
that was doing business with
Russell Matthews. Here's your guy.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.967
Nice of him to drop out of the sky like that.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.145
What's this?

28:59.838 --> 29:01.249
Could be a number of things.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.711
Looks like a freezer burn to me.

29:06.111 --> 29:08.648
The hitman who came in from the cold.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.393
RUSSELL: (ON INTERCOM) I'm telling you,
I've never seen this guy before.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.265
I don't know what my hair
is doing on his hands.

29:19.324 --> 29:20.894
Maybe you were in business with Ferguson,

29:20.959 --> 29:23.235
maybe you let him take DNA
from your backyard,

29:23.295 --> 29:24.968
maybe you got in an argument with him.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.771
No, no.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.846
We like this story, Russell.

29:30.669 --> 29:33.513
I mean, unless you have one we like better

29:33.905 --> 29:38.752
about your cousin Harry using your
backyard as his own petri dish.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.784
I am not saying anything against Harry.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.159
Who do you think

29:45.217 --> 29:47.925
put your hair under Eddie
Ferguson's fingernails?

29:47.986 --> 29:49.192
Let me get this straight.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.564
You think this whole Ferguson
thing was set up by Harry Rowan?

29:51.623 --> 29:54.433
I don't care. I'm not going against Harry.

29:55.327 --> 29:58.274
I've seen Harry go after his own kid brother.

30:00.032 --> 30:03.343
Harry'd kill you and wash his
hands in your own blood.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.579
We'll never get anything out of this mutt.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.549
Did the autopsy on Mr. Ferguson prove

30:08.607 --> 30:10.518
he'd been frozen then thawed?

30:10.575 --> 30:12.577
The autopsy proved when it
comes to medical science,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.453
you're better off asking the Magic 8 Ball.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.993
Any luck on a search
warrant for Rowan's place?

30:17.049 --> 30:20.826
Since the hairs connect the late Mr.
Ferguson to Russell Matthews,

30:20.886 --> 30:23.924
Judge Whitman feels there's
already a viable murder suspect

30:23.989 --> 30:26.993
lying in the morgue on Staten Island.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.595
So Rowan's little ruse paid off.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.662
The guy doesn't leave anything to chance.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.505
Well, chance is probably
what keeps him up at night.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.705
There's no such thing as a margin
of error in his line of work.

30:36.768 --> 30:39.044
Not unless he wants to stay out of jail.

30:39.237 --> 30:41.979
The fear of making a mistake,

30:43.809 --> 30:46.813
for him must be overwhelming. Consuming.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.720
Like an itch he can't scratch.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.960
Hi, Ms. Rowan. Let me give you a hand.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.261
You're the detectives
my husband was talking to?

30:57.322 --> 31:00.166
That's right. We need to ask you
about his consulting business.

31:00.225 --> 31:03.570
Well, I'm sure my husband will be happy
to answer all of your questions.

31:03.628 --> 31:06.199
Oh, I'm not sure that he'd want to.

31:06.264 --> 31:09.473
Does he ever talk about his
business travels, his clients?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.638
We have two kids,

31:10.702 --> 31:13.683
so we have plenty to talk
about besides his business.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.776
You ever met his clients?

31:15.907 --> 31:18.683
We have some photos to help you remember.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.223
Eddie Ferguson.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.226
Actually, last time your husband saw him,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.593
this is how he looked.

31:28.186 --> 31:30.598
And then there's James Hurly.

31:31.356 --> 31:33.700
This is Mr. Hurly the last
time he had a business meeting

31:33.759 --> 31:35.432
with your husband.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.742
And this job, Tommy Dunne.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.478
Shotgun blast to the head
while waiting at a stoplight.

31:43.535 --> 31:44.707
Why are you showing me this?

31:44.770 --> 31:46.681
This is what your husband does for a living.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.342
He kills people.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.715
This is how he paid for this car,

31:54.045 --> 31:56.787
for your house, for the Florida condo.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.350
It's not true.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.394
Okay, you ask your husband.

32:06.391 --> 32:10.464
You show him these and then ask him.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.466
That day that we came over,

32:14.533 --> 32:17.377
did you notice that he didn't want you around

32:17.436 --> 32:19.473
when he was talking to us?

32:21.373 --> 32:24.752
You ask him. If he's got nothing to hide,

32:25.010 --> 32:28.321
then why is he afraid
to talk to us in front of you?

32:41.793 --> 32:44.672
We got your message. But I bet my partner...

32:44.729 --> 32:46.834
We came here to return these.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.874
Stop harassing my family.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.875
Do we understand each other?

32:56.408 --> 32:59.412
You're not gonna stay and
talk, clear the air?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.424
What did I tell you, Ms. Rowan?

33:02.080 --> 33:03.821
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

33:08.220 --> 33:10.200
We can go in there.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.671
You can wait right here and see everything.

33:27.305 --> 33:28.648
After you.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.198
Let's start with a softball.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.570
The Saturday night before
Easter, where were you?

33:51.496 --> 33:53.476
I was stuck on the Taconic.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.239
Where had you been?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.338
Scouting an industrial park in Ossining.

33:58.637 --> 34:02.278
We'll want a list of your clients.
Your consulting clients.

34:06.511 --> 34:08.956
Do you read the Bible, Mr. Rowan?

34:11.815 --> 34:13.090
Not much.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.230
Exodus 9:8. The Sixth Plague.

34:20.759 --> 34:21.829
This

34:23.194 --> 34:24.672
Was very...

34:25.931 --> 34:28.241
It was a very elegant

34:29.400 --> 34:31.244
and inspired staging.

34:34.005 --> 34:37.918
I'm looking at this as a professional.

34:38.643 --> 34:42.556
What's most impressive
is the attention to detail.

34:44.549 --> 34:46.460
The posing of the body,

34:47.552 --> 34:49.690
the reddening of the skin with a torch,

34:49.754 --> 34:52.428
the injection of mineral spirit,

34:52.489 --> 34:54.400
propylene glycol, lanolin.

34:54.458 --> 34:59.169
It's the same composition as your
hand cleaner in your little workshop.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.910
The same careful planning
went into these crimes.

35:04.970 --> 35:06.347
The timing,

35:07.038 --> 35:09.382
lack of forensic evidence,

35:11.710 --> 35:13.348
except of course,

35:14.279 --> 35:17.192
for what the perpetrator
chose to leave behind.

35:18.483 --> 35:21.464
And this is where I step back in awe.

35:21.519 --> 35:23.362
The planting of the DNA

35:23.421 --> 35:27.062
and the harvesting from human remains.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.599
You know, as a pre-emptive measure.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.933
It's a...

35:33.999 --> 35:35.535
It's a stroke of genius.

35:38.403 --> 35:41.646
I mean, watching the police fumbling around

35:42.107 --> 35:44.553
must've been tremendous fun

35:45.977 --> 35:47.979
for the perpetrator, don't you think?

35:51.316 --> 35:53.057
Speaking as a concerned citizen,

35:53.118 --> 35:55.530
I wish the police were half as capable

35:55.587 --> 35:58.761
as this fellow seems to be.

36:00.225 --> 36:02.205
(STUTTERING)
Oh, everyone

36:03.561 --> 36:06.872
wants us to think that Eddie
Ferguson is this fellow,

36:07.632 --> 36:11.444
but we think that Eddie was
killed by, you know, this fellow.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.946
Killed 6 months ago and kept in a freezer.

36:15.206 --> 36:18.483
The reality is in this fellow's line of work,

36:18.777 --> 36:22.054
you live with the knowledge
that the smallest thing

36:23.882 --> 36:25.555
can give you away.

36:31.189 --> 36:35.865
Things like this freezer burn
right here on Eddie's shoulder.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.898
I mean, that tells us that

36:43.535 --> 36:46.345
whatever Eddie was wrapped in

36:48.773 --> 36:50.047
got loose

36:51.476 --> 36:52.955
or torn.

36:53.011 --> 36:57.756
Just a small mistake to remind
us that no one's perfect.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.209
Not that most of us need reminding.

37:24.142 --> 37:25.485
Excuse me.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.405
Why is he talking to my wife?

37:48.466 --> 37:49.945
I don't know.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.670
- Porcelain cap?
- Yeah.

37:52.737 --> 37:55.183
Like from a tooth.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.184
You don't remember seeing it in the garage?

38:05.817 --> 38:07.160
Mr. Rowan,

38:07.452 --> 38:09.796
thank you so much for coming in.

38:09.854 --> 38:12.960
The officers will show you downstairs.

38:24.602 --> 38:27.549
He said a porcelain cap, like for a tooth.

38:27.605 --> 38:29.141
Why would he ask me that, Harry?

38:29.207 --> 38:30.743
- What else did he say?
- Harry.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.015
What else, Susan?

38:32.076 --> 38:34.522
He wanted to know if the kids
would be home tomorrow morning.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.820
I told him they'd be at school.
Harry, what is going on?

38:36.881 --> 38:38.121
Just get in the car.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.795
One search warrant. Limited to the garage.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.861
Give me a chance to call
home, and I'll go with you.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.067
We're not executing the warrant tonight.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.577
We want to make sure that Harry
Rowan gets a good night's rest.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.150
What did you find out?

39:04.442 --> 39:06.080
Can we fight it?

39:07.045 --> 39:09.685
You are my lawyer, you tell me.

39:10.782 --> 39:11.886
Okay.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.488
Okay.

39:14.452 --> 39:17.990
Yes, I have an idea when they'll be here.

40:04.602 --> 40:05.945
(GRUNTING)

40:31.396 --> 40:32.636
Harry.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.340
It's late.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.043
What're you doing?

40:39.904 --> 40:41.542
Go to bed, Susan.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.145
Go to bed!

41:42.800 --> 41:44.541
You didn't find it, did you?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.245
The porcelain cap.

41:50.742 --> 41:53.086
You told him I asked you about it?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.013
Yes, but...

41:56.447 --> 41:58.188
I don't understand.

41:59.417 --> 42:01.055
The porcelain cap

42:01.619 --> 42:04.225
that fell out of Eddie Ferguson's mouth

42:05.289 --> 42:09.032
through the tear in the plastic
that you wrapped him in

42:11.229 --> 42:14.301
before stuffing him

42:15.199 --> 42:18.305
into the freezer six months ago

42:19.737 --> 42:24.015
right next to the leg of lamb
and the Rocky Road ice cream.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.652
Oh, my God.

42:26.944 --> 42:29.652
Oh, my God, Harry. What did you do?

42:31.749 --> 42:34.855
How long do you think it'll
take us to find it, Harry?

42:35.386 --> 42:36.888
It's not here.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.591
It can't be here. I looked.

42:41.492 --> 42:43.494
I didn't make a mistake.

42:43.995 --> 42:46.532
Sounds like an admission of guilt to me.

42:46.597 --> 42:49.976
Harry Rowan, you're under arrest for murder.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.784
A costly mistake.

43:05.883 --> 43:07.328
Harry didn't make a mistake.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.729
Eddie Ferguson doesn't wear caps.
