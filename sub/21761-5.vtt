stares right at you.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.765
Uh... Yeah. I got that.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.311
By putting this poster of me
in each and every household,

01:01.395 --> 01:04.606
I will bring happiness
to all of my peeps!

01:04.690 --> 01:05.733

01:06.274 --> 01:10.070
Um, you sure everyone wants that
in their bedrooms, Your Majesty?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.030
Mm.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.700
Ted, I can't sleep with him
staring at me like that.

01:14.783 --> 01:15.993
I know. Me, neither!

01:16.076 --> 01:19.872
It's just so exciting to have the King
right here in our boudoir.

01:19.955 --> 01:20.789
Ted!

01:20.873 --> 01:23.918
Hm, you're right, Clover.
The bedroom is good.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.421
But what are the peoples
going to look at in the bathroom?

01:27.504 --> 01:30.883
We will need posters
for every room of every house!

That will bring happiness
to the entire kingdom.

Mort, how's that coming along?

01:37.723 --> 01:40.976

I am unhappy!

Mort, if you are having a fit,
take it outside like always.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.000
Come on, fella.
You know the rules.

02:46.083 --> 02:50.629
No, wait! King Julien,
I have brought you something. A game.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.715
This will cure your unhappiness.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.469
What's this?
A cure for unhappiness?

02:57.552 --> 03:00.055
It says here this is a game
about money.

03:00.139 --> 03:04.059
You're supposed to use money
to buy stuff and obtain happiness.

03:04.143 --> 03:08.147
Look at that guy. He's got a lot of stuff
and happiness. Let's play!

03:08.647 --> 03:11.525
I don't know.
This game's got a lot of rules.

Great! Because I hate games,
but I love rules.

is so many ways.

fill themselves, Maurice.

Hm. "Sell this card to the person
across from you for twice its value."

04:09.875 --> 04:11.376
Here you go, Your Majesty.

04:12.794 --> 04:16.297
Oh, this little card was worthless

04:16.381 --> 04:18.633
and now it's worth twice as much.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.635
Amazing! [laughs]

04:20.719 --> 04:22.721
I love this game! [chuckles]

04:22.804 --> 04:26.100
Hurry, Mort, I want to keep playing.

So... pretty!

to buy a candy store."

-Oh, I love candy, too!

of what I could do with a candy store!

-Mort, I want that candy store.
-Okay.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.538
Stop there, Mort!
Can't just give it to him.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.915
But I want to.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.168
It's against the rules.
You have to play by the rules!

04:53.252 --> 04:55.712
-It's all right there! Memorize it!
-Okay.

04:55.796 --> 05:00.550
I should've known it would've gone down
like this. It always goes down like this.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.721
Everybody starts, "Oh, Clover,
I'll play by the rules. I'm so innocent.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.642
Me and Maurice would never cheat."
But they do! They always cheat!

Then it's a slippery slope
into total game anarchy!

-Nobody wants to play fair. Nobody!

aren't going to play by the rules,

then I am done. I'm out!

Wait. That's it!
I know what we must do.

05:30.664 --> 05:34.168
I will bring the happiness of this game
to the peoples!

[Mort] Hooray!

05:39.840 --> 05:43.551
-Huh? What is that?
-Pure happiness, Maurice.

05:43.635 --> 05:47.639
I've learned from playing the game
that money  does  buy you happiness.

05:47.722 --> 05:51.101
And now I'm giving that same happiness
to all of my peeps.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.743
No, new things scare me.
Get it away.

What is wrong with you, man?

06:20.505 --> 06:24.092
Hold on to-- Yes, someday
we will die, okay? But not now.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.678
So please,
you don't have anything to fear.

06:26.761 --> 06:32.100
Money has never caused any harm
to anyone ever!

06:32.391 --> 06:33.768
[all] Oh!

06:34.853 --> 06:36.188
[all] Huh?

06:38.397 --> 06:41.735
Okay, now everybody
has an equal amount of the money.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.987
So, we can let the happiness begin!

06:44.071 --> 06:46.948
Oh, I love this money even more!

06:47.032 --> 06:49.117
It has King Julien's face on it.

I love you. I love you.

Oh, I love this game so much.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.417
[groans] Mort, stop it.
It's a little creepy.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.921
Well, Mort's having fun...

07:01.546 --> 07:03.965
but I'm confused. I don't feel happy.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.092
Me, neither.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.307
I don't understand.
Why isn't it working, Maurice?

07:12.391 --> 07:14.935
Did we cook up a bad batch of the money?

07:15.018 --> 07:18.563
Come on, money, bring the happy.
Bring it!

07:19.147 --> 07:20.274
Pretty please?

07:20.399 --> 07:24.527
You can't rub it all over yourself
and expect it to work, Your Majesty.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.405
You gotta buy stuff, remember?

07:26.487 --> 07:28.907
Maurice, you're right.
Just like the game.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.202
We have to commence
with the buying of the stuff!

07:32.286 --> 07:34.996
-I'm gonna be rich!
-Keep it to yourself, Mort!

07:35.080 --> 07:38.250
Listen up, my peoples!
A little update happening here.

07:38.333 --> 07:43.755
Money does bring happiness
when you "buy stuff" with it.

07:43.838 --> 07:44.839
Observe.

07:44.923 --> 07:49.928
Clover, I'll give you
$100 for that coconut.

07:50.011 --> 07:50.929
What coconut?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.013
Oh.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.018
Here you go, Your Majesty.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.271
[laughs exultantly]

08:00.021 --> 08:02.357
Do you see?
Buying stuff is fun!

08:02.441 --> 08:07.028
Look at me! I have this coconut now
and I'm so much happier.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.573
Oh. And I have money now, too.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.743
And I am so happy now, too.

08:13.994 --> 08:18.165
But why should we use money
to buy things that are already free?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.291
Like coconuts!

08:19.707 --> 08:23.920
Clearly you do not understand
the concept of happiness, Hector.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.046
Big surprise.

08:25.130 --> 08:25.964
[growls]

Willie, I'll give you
$600 for that mango.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.932
I'll buy that mango for $700!

08:36.766 --> 08:39.811
Wow! Money is amazing!

08:39.894 --> 08:41.980
You got that right, baby! [chuckles]

08:42.105 --> 08:44.774
I'll give you $800 for that banana.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.902
Yeah, yeah, give it to me!
Give it to me! I got $100!

-Look at this cash.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.991
Anybody want a book?

08:53.074 --> 08:56.495
I'll take six of those
and I'll sell you four of these.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.622
-How much?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:59.706 --> 09:04.002
Whoa! I bought this fancy protective gear
to keep me safe. [screams]

09:04.085 --> 09:04.961

09:05.920 --> 09:09.174
It works! I'm alive!

09:09.257 --> 09:11.968
I think you've actually done it,
Your Majesty.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.262
-They look happy.
-Of course, Maurice.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.598
Money plus buying stuff equals happiness.

to be touching the Kingly Stool!

11:04.831 --> 11:06.791
How am I gonna buy a mango?

11:06.874 --> 11:08.585
Well, I'm out, too.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.837
What are we gonna do, Willie?

11:10.920 --> 11:11.754
Oh!

11:11.838 --> 11:13.214
[mumbling indistinctly]

11:13.298 --> 11:14.882
Oh, perfect!

11:14.966 --> 11:17.135
I can help you.
[giggles]

11:17.385 --> 11:18.261
[both] Huh?

11:20.721 --> 11:23.057
-I'll give you $500.
-Sold.

11:24.142 --> 11:29.481
Oooh. Look at this amazing book.
So beautiful!

11:29.564 --> 11:31.858
I could never part with it,

11:31.941 --> 11:35.278
but I'll sell it to you for $10,000.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.365
Oh, you are so right.
I just gotta have it!

11:38.448 --> 11:42.619
Uh... can I owe you? Just, you know,
maybe write it down somewhere?

11:42.701 --> 11:44.579
Sure. We'll work something out.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.746
[cash register dings]

11:45.830 --> 11:46.873
[giggles evilly]

11:47.499 --> 11:48.583
[humming]

11:48.667 --> 11:49.543
[screams]

11:49.626 --> 11:53.254
Don't you just love these?
I spent my last eight grand on 'em.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.340
-You sure they're worth it?
-Yeah!

11:55.423 --> 11:58.885
Because I use them to see something
I want to buy even more!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.512
I must own this.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.473
I call it a "Rear View Mirror".

12:03.557 --> 12:07.185
Because I can view
my rear with it.

12:07.686 --> 12:08.853
[grunts]

12:10.063 --> 12:11.730
Quick, give me twenty grand!

12:11.814 --> 12:14.025
Sorry, Your Majesty, I'm all out.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.068
Out?

12:15.527 --> 12:18.905
I need to make some money.
What do I have that I can sell?

12:18.988 --> 12:20.281
Think. Think.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.453
Um, Your Majesty,
why are you looking at me?

12:25.537 --> 12:29.207
Clover, stand right here.
I'd like to open the bidding at $100!

12:29.290 --> 12:32.793
King Julien, you can't auction me off.
I'm not your property.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.671
Oh, Clover, don't be silly.

12:34.753 --> 12:39.884
Okay! Who'll give me $450? $500!
Give me five! Give me five! Give me five!

12:39.967 --> 12:43.388
-You in the back! Six!
-$600 for the aggressive lady lemur.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.390
$800 and a really big hug.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.308
$20,000.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.810
-Sold to the little mousy lemur!
-[gasps]

12:49.894 --> 12:52.230
How could-- You mean I have to-- Mort?!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.190
[giggles]

12:55.609 --> 12:59.320
Oh, hello.
Where have you been all my life?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.573
I was sitting on you earlier.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.325
Objects are closer than they appear!

13:05.201 --> 13:06.578
Oh, you saucy thing.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.537
Huh?

13:08.371 --> 13:09.706
[exclaiming excitedly]

13:13.960 --> 13:15.128
I'm poor!

13:22.469 --> 13:26.389
Welcome to  The Super Fabulous Life
of the Filthy Rich.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.434
And there's nobody richer
or filthier than--

13:29.517 --> 13:30.393
[thud]

13:30.477 --> 13:32.437
Me! I'm the filthiest!

13:32.520 --> 13:33.521
[laughs]

13:33.605 --> 13:36.441
Filthy rich!
Filthy dirty rich! Yeah!

13:37.233 --> 13:40.236
Mort, do you ever feel like
you have too much money?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.363
That's a good question, Xixi.

13:42.781 --> 13:43.698
Um...

13:44.240 --> 13:47.535
-Um, no!
-Please, Mort, I have no money.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.329
Take my baby and raise her.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.706
Give her a better life than I can.

13:51.790 --> 13:52.749
Okay!

13:52.831 --> 13:56.835
Don't worry, everybody!
I'm a-gonna raise your babies right!

13:57.086 --> 13:59.922
[Xixi]  Whether it's raising
other people's babies

14:00.006 --> 14:04.302
or relaxing atop a pile of money
on his yacht, the S.S.  Peepee Pants...

14:04.385 --> 14:06.387
[giggles]
You said, "Pants"!

14:06.471 --> 14:09.056
...he is a true inspiration for us all.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.642
Thank you, Xixi.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.812
By the way, how much do you want
for that beak, huh?

14:13.894 --> 14:16.272
I really need a new angle
for this thing.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.316
Oh, that's much worse.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.862
Maurice, I need more money to buy
something new to make me happy.

14:23.070 --> 14:26.157
Can't, Your Majesty.
The money's gone. All of it!

14:26.282 --> 14:27.575
Everybody spent it.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.952
What? No more money?

14:30.036 --> 14:33.956
It's all in the hands of the top 1%
of the population, namely Mort.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.669
[exclaiming in delight]

14:42.465 --> 14:44.801
So hungry!

14:45.844 --> 14:46.678
Oh!

14:46.761 --> 14:48.763
We're starving.

14:48.847 --> 14:52.016
My insides are eating themselves.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.267
Oh, drama!

14:53.351 --> 14:54.894
You can't be starving.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.980
There's a mango tree right there
full of mangoes!

14:58.064 --> 15:00.107
Mort owns all the mango trees.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.860
And we don't have any money.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.571
Plus, Clover's standing guard.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.323
[whimpers]

15:07.990 --> 15:09.617
Poor Todd.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.911
You look so hungry.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.248
I think maybe you can have a mango.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.041
What's going on, Clover?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.252
Are you not playing by the rules?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.629
[laughs awkwardly]
Of course I am, boss.

15:21.713 --> 15:26.760
I was just offering Todd
a mango so I could do this!

15:26.843 --> 15:28.553
-You want a mango?
-Yes.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.098
Well, tough. Go get a job
and earn enough money to buy one!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.224
[whimpering]

15:33.307 --> 15:34.475
[giggles]

15:34.893 --> 15:37.896
Listen, Todd, sorry about that.
Those are the rules.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.981
Don't make 'em. Just enforce 'em.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.902
We're all gonna die! Ooh!

15:44.778 --> 15:49.323
According to the contract,
you owe me your soul now.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.200
Are you really good with that?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.285
Uh-huh.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.536
Okey-dokey!

15:54.788 --> 15:56.330
This is so wrong.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.375
I should own the kingdom's souls,
not Mort!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.461
The little guy's good with money.

16:01.544 --> 16:05.590
No offense, King Julien, but this all
kind of happened because of you.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.302
[snarls] Roar, hiss, Maurice.
Just roar, hiss!

16:13.556 --> 16:15.516
Oh, King Julien!

16:15.600 --> 16:17.685
Do you want to sell me your soul?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.771
It's a dream come true.

16:19.854 --> 16:23.566
No, Mort. I like my soul
right where it is, thank you very much!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.945
It's right-- It--
Well, it's in here somewhere!

16:27.654 --> 16:28.947
Anyway, Mort, listen.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.866
The peoples,
they are starving for happiness.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.118
And they're also starving!

16:34.619 --> 16:36.078
We need some money.

16:36.162 --> 16:40.207
And I thought we could, you know,
work something out.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.752
I can't!
The rules say that...

16:42.836 --> 16:44.420
Wait! I've got it!

16:44.504 --> 16:48.007
I could give you money
if you did favors for me.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.468
Mort! Are you trying
to corrupt the King?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.220
Hah-a-hah-a-hah!

16:53.304 --> 16:54.764
[sniffs]

16:54.848 --> 16:57.600
Now, now, Maurice,
let's not be too hasty.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.937
-[groans]
-What kind of favors exactly?

17:02.313 --> 17:05.859
Oh, I can't tell you
how I've dreamed of this moment.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.528
You, me, together!

17:10.196 --> 17:11.906
No, Mort, no, too much!

17:11.990 --> 17:13.867
Come on, foot, we're outta here.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.743
[crying]

17:17.161 --> 17:18.371
Mort, I've had it!

17:18.454 --> 17:20.999
-I am putting my feet down!
-[excitedly] Oh!

17:21.081 --> 17:24.460
I demand you turn all the money
over to me.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.671
Now! I demand it as your king.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.924
Gimme the money.
Give it here this instant. All of it!

17:30.008 --> 17:32.010
But that would be cheating.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.636
King Julien is cheating!

17:33.720 --> 17:36.848
[gasps, crying] No!

17:36.931 --> 17:38.432
Clover, help me out here.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.769
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You auctioned me off, remember?

17:41.853 --> 17:43.062
I work for Mort now.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.733
People! People!
Good news!

17:46.858 --> 17:48.651
We're not gonna starve?

17:48.735 --> 17:52.154
Uh, okay, I got confused there.
I meant to say...

17:52.238 --> 17:53.823
terrible news!

17:53.907 --> 17:57.785
Mort won't give us the money back
and you're all going to starve.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.245
[grunts]

17:59.328 --> 18:01.664
But I have a new plan.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.957
Come on, peoples!

18:03.041 --> 18:05.585
If we really pull together
and gather up

18:05.668 --> 18:07.461
everything we have left,

18:07.545 --> 18:10.715
maybe we can trade it to Mort
for some food.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.342
Here, take my beverage.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.054
Use our wedding rings.
They were my mother's.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.304
Here's my teeth.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.433
I'm not using them to eat anyway.
I can't afford it.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.726
[Maurice] Hm? Hm!

18:26.856 --> 18:28.357
King Julien!

18:28.608 --> 18:30.484
Mort, I'm desperate.

18:30.985 --> 18:35.364
I've come with the very last possessions
of everybody in the kingdom,

18:35.448 --> 18:38.993
all in the hopes
that I could trade it for some food.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.328
Sure, you could trade it for food.

18:41.412 --> 18:45.792
Or you could trade it for this.

18:45.875 --> 18:50.088
It's extra amazing and guaranteed
to bring happiness.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.174
But the peoples and their hungriness!

18:54.258 --> 18:56.094
Don't worry about it.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.721
The people are gonna love this.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.847
Really?

19:00.807 --> 19:01.975
Whoa-oohhhh.

19:02.516 --> 19:04.393
Great news, everybody!

19:05.061 --> 19:06.437
You got us some food?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.440
Ah... oh. Food. Well, no.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.401
-I didn't actually get any food.
-[groans]

19:12.485 --> 19:15.071
But I did get something pretty amazing

19:15.154 --> 19:18.240
to help make you all feel a lot happier!

19:18.491 --> 19:22.078
It's some kind of jumping bean.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.245
[laughs]

19:23.329 --> 19:26.582
See? It's a bean and it jumps!

19:26.666 --> 19:27.708
[chuckles]

19:27.792 --> 19:30.210
Isn't it great? Come on, jump!

19:30.336 --> 19:34.674
Dorothy, hold my head up
so I can give one last,

19:34.757 --> 19:36.342
"Oh, no, you didn't."

19:37.176 --> 19:39.178
Oh, no, you didn't!

19:39.261 --> 19:40.096
[sighs]

19:40.179 --> 19:42.264
But Mort said you would love it.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.433
It jumps! See?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.477
Jumping... bean!

19:46.978 --> 19:49.105
[laughs]

19:49.188 --> 19:50.606
[people muttering]

19:56.195 --> 19:59.740
This isn't bringing happiness.
Oh! Mort tricked me!

19:59.824 --> 20:03.786
King Julien, you just sold
every last possession for a jumping bean.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.497
Your people are starving!
You gotta fix this!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.207
That's exactly what I'll do.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.877
I'll be strong!
I'll be forceful!

20:10.960 --> 20:14.172
I'll stand my ground
like the king that I am!

20:14.505 --> 20:16.298
[crying]

20:17.341 --> 20:19.677
Please, Mort, please!

20:19.927 --> 20:21.888
I'm really, really desperate now.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.389
I was wrong.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.101
There is no happiness in this...
[gulps] ...money.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.979
Everyone is starving! [coughs]

20:30.063 --> 20:32.481
Please, Mort, please!

20:32.565 --> 20:35.026
What will end this madness?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.570
What do you want from me?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.697
-What do you got?
-Nothing.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.365
You have it all, Mort.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.409
All I have left is my...

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
The crown is the last thing I have.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.376
The very last thing in all the kingdom.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.671
Here, it is yours.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.507
Just give the peoples back their stuff...

20:58.591 --> 20:59.967
and their money...

21:00.467 --> 21:01.928
and their souls.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.555
Take it!

21:04.638 --> 21:05.848
Take it all!

21:07.183 --> 21:08.935
Now you have everything!

21:09.018 --> 21:11.229
You have everything, okay?

21:11.311 --> 21:13.189
You win, Mort!

21:13.731 --> 21:14.690
You win!

21:15.233 --> 21:17.193
What? I win? Really?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.236
Hooray!

21:18.318 --> 21:21.030
I won! I won! I won! [laughs]

21:21.114 --> 21:22.823
I won! Oh, yeah!

21:22.907 --> 21:24.408
So filthy dirty rich!

21:24.491 --> 21:25.534
Filthy dirty!

21:25.618 --> 21:27.078
I have everything!

21:27.161 --> 21:28.955
I won! I won it all!

21:29.038 --> 21:32.083
Yes! Yes! Yes!

21:32.499 --> 21:33.584
Ah, that was fun.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.504
Okay, everybody, game's over!

21:37.588 --> 21:39.298
You can have your stuff back!

21:39.381 --> 21:42.260
Here you go. Here's your stuff back.
Game's over.

21:42.342 --> 21:45.512
We don't need money anymore.
I'm putting it all away.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.266
No more money.
Game's over. I won.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.226
See, King Julien?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.853
Playing that game made everybody happy.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.354
Wait a minute.

21:54.438 --> 21:58.025
Mort, have you been playing
the game this entire time?

21:58.234 --> 22:00.569
Uh... Wasn't everybody?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.406
Phew! Well, thank the gods,
that's over!

22:04.490 --> 22:05.866
I second that emotion.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.327
Over? Oh, no, no, no.

22:08.410 --> 22:11.164
Do either of you realize what this means?

22:11.497 --> 22:14.458
Life is more important
than money and buying stuff?

22:14.541 --> 22:17.711
You shouldn't auction off
your friends and colleagues?

22:17.795 --> 22:19.213
Don't be silly, you two.

22:19.297 --> 22:22.716
It means Mort just beat me

22:22.800 --> 22:24.135
at a board game!

22:24.218 --> 22:25.343
A board game!

22:26.304 --> 22:27.805
Mort, stop.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.641
Best two out of three, buddy?

22:30.724 --> 22:33.686
[giggles] Yes! Yes!
A thousand times yes!

22:34.937 --> 22:35.980
[Clover sighs]

22:36.063 --> 22:40.193
[Maurice] Okay. Just as long as I don't
have to go back to prison.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.779
[upbeat pop music playing]
