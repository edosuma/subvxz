00:10.410 --> 00:15.181
Mars will enter Capricorn
on the 17th, but beware,

00:15.248 --> 00:20.887
Mercury is moving retrograde
through Scorpio, which can
mean only one thing.

00:20.954 --> 00:23.356
A vital letter will
be lost in the post.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.159
I'll look out for that.
Can you see anything else?

00:26.226 --> 00:28.361
What if I do go ahead
and leave the carpet shop?

00:28.428 --> 00:29.963
Will I find another job?

00:30.029 --> 00:34.667
Yes. Saturn signifies a new
occupation, in communications.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.237
I see a call centre.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.305
With better money?

00:39.372 --> 00:44.511
Jupiter,
the planet of abundance,
is traversing the fifth house.

00:44.577 --> 00:49.182
There will be better
money for all those born
under the sign of Gemini.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.384
Fantastic.
Oh, for both of us.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.520
You're Gemini, too,
aren't you?

00:53.586 --> 00:56.656
Sign of the twins. Two faces.

00:57.590 --> 00:59.692
(ALARM BEEPING)

00:59.759 --> 01:01.561
This session's over, Cheryl.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.830
Thanks.
You're brilliant, Martin.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.932
My husband thinks
I'm mad coming to see you.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.701
He says none of your
predictions come true.

01:08.768 --> 01:10.003
Like when I was
gonna win that holiday

01:10.069 --> 01:11.604
and we were gonna
move to Scotland.

01:11.671 --> 01:15.241
But I told him
the stars work in
mysterious ways.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.843
They do indeed.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.212
I said,
"So what if we fall behind
on the mortgage?

01:19.279 --> 01:21.948
"Martin is worth every penny."

01:22.015 --> 01:25.385
No, no, stop. Cheryl,
I can't take your
mortgage money.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.921
What?

01:28.121 --> 01:30.023
(SIGHING) I'm a fraud.

01:30.623 --> 01:33.560
Say again?

01:33.626 --> 01:36.930
I won't take your money,
'cause I was just
making it all up.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.399
There's no power in the stars.

01:39.466 --> 01:43.102
(SCOFFING) Please, please.
I can't take the money.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.839
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.807
The stars guide
everything we do.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.409
(CHUCKLING) You think
anything up there

01:49.476 --> 01:53.146
has any influence
down here, on you and me?

01:53.213 --> 01:55.849
Do you really believe
there is such
a thing as destiny?

02:00.153 --> 02:01.488
If only there was.

02:02.255 --> 02:03.957
When I was a kid,

02:04.023 --> 02:07.227
I was convinced
I was going to
do great things.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.027
It was fate.

02:09.095 --> 02:12.932
But I failed in
everything I tried.
All my life.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.935
And I end up like this.
A con artist.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.815
What was that? Martin?

02:30.383 --> 02:33.453
Mr Trueman?
You all right?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.888
At last!

02:37.490 --> 02:38.858
What just happened there?

02:38.925 --> 02:42.629
Gemini.
You are going on
a long journey.

02:42.695 --> 02:43.897
A very long journey.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.867
(SCREAMING)

03:06.152 --> 03:09.088
The only reason I'm down here
is because this is free.

03:09.155 --> 03:12.158
All these horoscopes,
signs of the zodiac.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.826
It's so sad.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.797
Come on, Clyde.
Everyone checks their stars.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.832
I'm Aries.
Confident, a great leader.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.402
-What sign are you?
-I'm not getting into this.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.437
His birthday is
June the 5th.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.273
Right. Gemini.
Funny, popular.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.275
Yeah? Maybe there
is something in it.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.843
Lazy, shallow.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.112
There. You see? It's rubbish.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.315
RANI: How about you, Luke?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.750
Astrology has
no scientific basis.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.719
It's based on
primitive observations

03:39.786 --> 03:42.589
and a misunderstanding
of the way the universe works.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.190
(CHUCKLING) Thanks for that.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.726
I meant, what's your sign,
when's your birthday?

03:46.793 --> 03:48.428
I don't have one.

03:49.228 --> 03:50.597
Good evening.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.467
If I could just
ask you to write down

03:54.534 --> 03:59.072
your names and dates of birth
and put them in the box here?

03:59.138 --> 04:01.274
-Do we have to?
-Everyone has to.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.077
It's part of the show,
an essential part of the show.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.182
What do I put?
I don't have a star sign.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.517
-I wasn't born.
-Sorry, I forgot.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.353
What about the day you were...

04:13.419 --> 04:14.921
-Switched on.
-Activated.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.557
Oh, man.
What am I doing here?

04:17.624 --> 04:19.291
This is no way to
spend a Friday night.

04:19.358 --> 04:22.395
I should be out there,
moving, shaking.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.830
Or perhaps
doing your homework?

04:23.896 --> 04:25.231
Dad! You said
you weren't coming.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.000
He's so narrow-minded.
I said to him,

04:27.066 --> 04:29.168
"How can you dismiss
something, Haresh,

04:29.235 --> 04:30.703
"if you don't give it
a chance?"

04:30.770 --> 04:32.605
Wasn't expecting
to see you here, Mum.

04:32.672 --> 04:35.241
Nice to spend time
with some adults,
for a change.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.411
Trueman's come from nowhere,
now he's pulling in people.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.279
Who knows?
There might be a story in it.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.581
You work too hard.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.650
I've been telling her
she needs a night out.

-No.

04:55.395 --> 04:56.829
But I'm always willing
to be convinced.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.698
Just not expecting
to be convinced.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.369
Cheryl, I need to talk to you.

05:03.436 --> 05:07.073
Stuart, how nice to see you.
Why not come and see the show?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.442
No, I don't want
to see the show.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.210
I want you to
come back home.

05:11.277 --> 05:15.848
I've made my decision, Stuart.
I'm staying with Mr Trueman.

05:15.915 --> 05:17.483
He's done something to you.

05:17.550 --> 05:21.354
I can see it, Cheryl.
It's in your eyes.

05:21.421 --> 05:25.425
Typical Scorpio,
jealous and obsessive.

05:26.592 --> 05:28.461
I'm the same
as I've always been.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.631
I'm not leaving here
without you.

05:31.698 --> 05:36.569
Go, Stuart.
Or should I call the police?

05:36.636 --> 05:37.870
Maybe it's me
that should be calling them.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.473
Something's wrong here.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.475
Hang on! There's your story.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.811
-I knew it.
-What's wrong?

05:44.877 --> 05:46.279
I can't even have
one night out

05:46.345 --> 05:48.781
without something
weird happening.
Come on.

Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight, I'd like to share
my journey with you.

07:07.393 --> 07:11.998
I was a nothing,
a nobody, until I learnt
the secrets of the stars.

07:12.064 --> 07:15.301
In some ways,
I feel as if I was chosen.

07:15.368 --> 07:19.372

more in the universe
than what we see from Earth.

There are 200 billion stars
in our galaxy alone.

Huge, shifting stellar forces,
pulsing with ancient light.

07:28.014 --> 07:32.685

come here for a science
lesson, did you? No.

for my three accomplices.

08:14.827 --> 08:15.962
The power of suggestion.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.731
Oh, simple stuff.

that again, okay?

indicates a love of learning.

perhaps you've just
gone back to college?

shall we?

09:03.476 --> 09:05.678
Where's Rani Chandra?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.346

09:07.413 --> 09:09.081
(ALL LAUGHING)

09:09.148 --> 09:12.518

would you confirm that
you and I have never met?

09:12.585 --> 09:14.954
No, we've never met before.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.357
Thank you.
Now, in your chart, Rani,

09:18.424 --> 09:20.993
Mercury is in conjunction
with Neptune.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.562
Am I right in thinking
you've just moved house?

09:23.629 --> 09:25.831
(CHUCKLING) Yes. You're right.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.470
In fact,
your whole life is changing.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.407
You suddenly
see the world
in a new light.

09:34.473 --> 09:38.611
-It's exciting
and you love it.
-Yes. Incredible.

09:38.678 --> 09:42.882
There's an anchoring
influence in your life,
represented by Saturn.

A Taurus man,
someone very
calm and reliable.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.355
Is it your dad?
A teacher?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.291
It's my husband!
He's here.

09:52.358 --> 09:56.095
And there's Mum,
a Gemini, of course.
Thank you, Rani.

10:01.901 --> 10:05.972
Now I'm being
strangely drawn to
a Sarah Jane Smith.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.109
That's me.

10:10.176 --> 10:14.847
Ah, Taurus!
Strong, determined.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.650
Now, you were born under
a very special star,

10:17.717 --> 10:20.319
Neptune in your fifth house.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.289
Some years ago,
you travelled far and wide

10:23.356 --> 10:26.092
and, ah, the things
you have seen.

10:26.158 --> 10:30.363
And there was a man,
a very special man.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.199
No, no. Let me think.
It wasn't a romance, no.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.501
It was something
much, much more than that.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.904
He taught you so much.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.607
There was
laughter and adventure

10:41.674 --> 10:46.245
and you prayed that
your time with him
would never, never end.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.049
But then,
suddenly, he left you.

10:50.116 --> 10:51.484
(WHISPERING) I knew
there was a bloke.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.352
-What did I say? Broken heart.
-A man with no name.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.688
-He's upsetting her.
-A scientist?

10:56.856 --> 10:58.824
No, a doctor.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.726
The Doctor!

11:00.793 --> 11:01.861
Hello, Sarah Jane.

11:01.927 --> 11:04.730
Doctor. It's you, isn't it?

11:04.797 --> 11:06.732
-Am I right?
-Yes. You're right.

11:06.799 --> 11:09.035
Tell me, right now,
how do you know that?

11:09.101 --> 11:11.170
It's all in your stars.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.372
There's Jupiter
in your 12th house.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.241
You are the
keeper of secrets.

11:15.307 --> 11:18.244
If you're so clever,
tell me about the future.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.812
If you want.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.850
Oh, I'm afraid Saturn
is transiting Taurus.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.620
You have fought
many battles in your life.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.422
You're about
to fight another,

11:29.488 --> 11:31.924
but, this time,
it will be different.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.860
This time, Sarah Jane,

11:36.595 --> 11:38.397
you lose.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.002
He probably looked it up
on the internet.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.471
(SCOFFING)
He didn't have the time.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.007
He got it exactly
right for everyone.

11:48.074 --> 11:51.410
And as for you,
Secret Sarah,
woman of mystery.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.679
Come on,
what are you hiding?

11:53.746 --> 11:55.714
Who is this doctor?
He sounds gorgeous.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.184
-Come on, Mum. See you later.
-Bye!

11:58.250 --> 11:59.785
See you on Monday, lads.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.290
How could he know
so much about you?

12:04.356 --> 12:06.392
How could he make me
bounce up and down?

12:06.459 --> 12:07.927
It was like I had to.
I didn't want to.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.762
If he knows
about the Doctor...

12:09.829 --> 12:11.530
Excuse me.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.999
-He could be an alien.
-No. I did a scan.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.868
Trueman is human.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.870
We'll see what Mr Smith says.

12:22.141 --> 12:25.311
Another good show, Martin.
Wonderful.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.446
Pity it had to be
the last performance.

12:27.513 --> 12:30.583
But the shows have
served their purpose.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.385
Tomorrow I will speak
to the entire world.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.789
But how?
Only people here
know of you, Martin.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.692
It is destined.
Any moment now.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.093
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

12:45.064 --> 12:48.501
Hey, Mr Trueman.
Great show.
Lisa Trotter.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.469
I've seen you on TV.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.905
<i>Paranormal Planet,</i>
on the Psychic Channel?

12:52.972 --> 12:56.108
That's right. We're doing
a live interview tomorrow,

12:56.175 --> 12:57.743
but we've had
a bit of bad luck.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.412
We had the Celestial
Deirdre lined up,
you know her?

13:00.479 --> 13:02.882
I am familiar
with her work.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.118
Anyways,
she's had an accident,
had to drop out.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.988
Oh, dear.
Nothing serious, I hope?

13:09.054 --> 13:12.024
She says she fell down
the stairs at home.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.826
Which is a bit
strange, actually,

13:13.893 --> 13:16.762
because, come to think of it,
she lives in a bungalow.

13:16.829 --> 13:20.199
How very unfortunate.
Is there anything
I can do to help?

13:20.266 --> 13:22.701
Well, I know
it's a bit short notice,

13:22.768 --> 13:25.504
but I'd really love you
to step in as our guest.

13:25.571 --> 13:29.708
-That would be wonderful.
-(SIGHING) Great.
You're a lifesaver.

13:29.775 --> 13:35.080
Yes. I want to get
my message across to
as many people as possible.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.715
What a wonderful surprise.

13:36.782 --> 13:40.853
(LAUGHING) Yeah.
Surprised you
didn't see it coming!

13:41.754 --> 13:42.922
(DOOR OPENING)

13:45.925 --> 13:48.794
Mr Smith, I need you.

13:56.268 --> 13:59.104
MR SMITH:
<i>Good evening, Sarah Jane.</i>
<i>What can I do?</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:02.808
Mr Smith,
scan the area around the
New Theatre, East Acton.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.910
Look for anything
unusual or alien.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.746
Psychic energy, yeah?
We know that's real.

14:07.813 --> 14:10.382
You almost brought
the moon crashing down
with your almighty brain.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.318
No, that is not
what Trueman is about.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.920
He can see into
people's lives and destinies.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.755
Yeah, by mind-reading.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.691
No,
by calculating the positions
of stars and planets

14:18.757 --> 14:20.659
when they were born,
which is impossible.

14:20.726 --> 14:22.728
MR SMITH: <i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>scan completed.</i>

14:22.795 --> 14:25.397
<i>I've detected</i>
<i>no irregularities</i>
<i>in the vicinity.</i>

14:25.464 --> 14:28.634
There must be something.
An atmospheric disturbance,
an energy spike?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.569
<i>There has been no such event.</i>

14:30.636 --> 14:32.905
What if it's real?
How could we detect it?

14:32.972 --> 14:36.875
-We don't even believe in it.
-Say that again?

14:36.942 --> 14:40.145
Wow. Have I finally done it?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.514
Yes! I have confused you.

14:42.581 --> 14:46.085
Think, think, think,
think, think, think.

14:46.151 --> 14:49.755
Of course!
He must be
using a bio-damper.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.390
What's that?
Washing powder?

14:51.457 --> 14:54.627
An alien device for shielding
high-technology emissions.

14:54.693 --> 14:58.030
Mr Smith, I need you
to locate a man
called Martin Trueman.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.801
TRUEMAN: I can feel
the power of the stars,

15:02.868 --> 15:04.703
not just the ones we can see.

15:04.770 --> 15:07.873
Suns, planets, whole galaxies,

15:07.940 --> 15:12.811
shifting and turning cogs
in the great machine
of the universe.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.083
The conjunction is perfect.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.686
Right now,
across that infinite distance,

15:20.753 --> 15:25.157
the Ancient Lights
are aligned precisely with me.

15:25.224 --> 15:29.395
-And tomorrow,
the television broadcast.
-It is destined.

15:29.461 --> 15:32.197
Soon the whole world
will know my blessing.

15:32.264 --> 15:36.035
But I have an opponent.
Sarah Jane Smith.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.505
Now that Taurus is rising,
she will try to
prevent the broadcast.

15:39.571 --> 15:40.906
But you will stop her?

15:40.973 --> 15:43.309
Oh, yes. She can't interfere.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.712
All the forces of destiny
are gathered against her.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.550
(MAN TALKING ON TV)

15:53.719 --> 15:55.788
I'm off to see Trueman.

15:55.854 --> 15:59.391
I've reset the scanner to
search for bio-damper
interference patterns.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.826
It might just work.

16:03.095 --> 16:04.863
Hey. What's up?

16:08.734 --> 16:12.604
Last night, everyone
was talking about
their star signs.

16:12.671 --> 16:14.406
And I don't have one.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.076
I could give you
a birthday if you want.
The day I found you.

16:17.142 --> 16:20.512
-I put that on
the adoption forms.
-I wasn't born, Mum.

16:20.579 --> 16:24.483
I was activated.
"Happy Activation Day!"

16:24.550 --> 16:27.786
It doesn't
sound right, does it?
It's another strange thing.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.689
Something else
that sets me apart.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.192
Whatever day it is,
that doesn't matter.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.928
You're not
celebrating the day,
but the person.

16:36.128 --> 16:40.499
But where you
come from, a childhood,
it makes people who they are.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.102
I come from nowhere.
I was never a baby.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.904
Oh, Luke.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.107
I thought it
would get easier,

16:48.173 --> 16:51.844
but there are
always new things
coming along, like this,

16:51.910 --> 16:53.912
to make me feel different.

16:53.979 --> 16:58.384
Just remember.
You're strong.
I've seen you learn.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.853
You're my son
and you're brilliant.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.689
That's me.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.325
What's my brilliant son
going to do today?

17:06.392 --> 17:09.928
Look for clues.
Read up on astrology
with Mr Smith.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.766
Fantastic.
Well, I'd better be off,
if you're all right?

17:13.832 --> 17:14.867
See you later.

17:18.503 --> 17:19.838
(DOOR CLOSING)

17:21.373 --> 17:22.808
(CAR LOCK BEEPING)

17:26.912 --> 17:29.515
-Morning, Sarah Jane.
-I'm off to see Trueman.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.283
-You made an appointment?
-Oh, no.

17:31.350 --> 17:34.720
This is going to
be an old-fashioned
foot-in-the-door job.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.122
Need another pair of feet?

17:37.189 --> 17:40.859
MR SMITH:
<i>The origins of astrology</i>
<i>are lost in the mists of time.</i>

17:40.926 --> 17:44.163
It says that
the earliest record
of astrology was in Babylon,

17:44.229 --> 17:47.366
-in the16th century BC.
<i>-It is older than that.</i>

17:47.433 --> 17:49.468
<i>And not just here on Earth.</i>

17:49.535 --> 17:53.205
<i>Primitive cultures</i>
<i>across the universe</i>
<i>charted patterns of stars.</i>

17:53.272 --> 17:57.009
<i>This is</i>
<i>the zodiac of the planet</i>
<i>Ventiplex, for example.</i>

17:57.075 --> 17:59.611
<i>And this is</i>
<i>the zodiac of Draconia.</i>

17:59.678 --> 18:02.247
There's astrology in the
cultures of other planets?

18:02.314 --> 18:04.249
<i>Yes, Luke.</i>
<i>A similar system operates</i>

18:04.316 --> 18:07.085
<i>in the culture of almost</i>
<i>every inhabited planet.</i>

18:07.152 --> 18:08.454
So it's everywhere.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.623
That's the one.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.927
What if he tells us
to clear off?

18:14.993 --> 18:19.031
First rule of journalism,
never take "no" for an answer.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.199
(LAUGHS)

18:20.265 --> 18:22.534
I learnt that lesson
a long time ago.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.874
Miss Smith!
Please, come in.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.612
I've done some research,

18:33.679 --> 18:36.782
and until two months ago,
you led a pretty quiet life.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.084
Oh, no, no, no, Miss Smith.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.254
I made a lot of noise
but nobody ever listened.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.425
Two months ago,
you declare yourself
the new messiah of the zodiac.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.161
She's good.
Your protege.

18:49.228 --> 18:51.463
Just like when you were
the Doctor's protege.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.799
Is she your companion?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.601
How do you know
about the Doctor?

18:55.667 --> 18:58.270
We come from two
different worlds.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.740
I'm a believer.
You are a skeptic.
No common ground.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.309
How can I explain myself?

19:04.376 --> 19:06.044
How can you tell
I don't believe you?

19:06.111 --> 19:09.114
I've read your chart.
You're both fighters.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.317
(CHUCKLES)
Adventure, excitement,

19:12.384 --> 19:14.353
battles against the
most remarkable things.

19:14.419 --> 19:15.654
(BUZZING)

19:15.854 --> 19:19.925
Oh, scan away, please.
You won't find anything.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.228
(LAUGHING) People like you
have to scan everything.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.197
Where does that
get you in the end?

19:25.264 --> 19:27.366
There is no end.
There doesn't have to be.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.468
Learning, finding out
about the universe,

19:29.535 --> 19:32.304
that's all the wonder, beauty
and strangeness I'll need.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.672
Often it's
more than enough.

19:33.739 --> 19:37.242
It's such a shame
that it has to end.

19:37.309 --> 19:40.512
And I can't have you
standing in my way.

19:40.579 --> 19:43.749
I've got things to do.
Such amazing things.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.918
Whatever you're planning,
I'll stop it.

19:45.984 --> 19:49.655
Oh, a threat!
He taught you well, didn't he?

19:49.721 --> 19:53.859
The Doctor?
But he's not here.
Not this time.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.729
And poor little Rani.

19:57.796 --> 20:01.033
You've been
lying to her mother,
haven't you?

20:01.099 --> 20:03.835
Oh, dear, Miss Smith.

20:03.902 --> 20:07.506
Allowing children
into your dangerous world.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.007
Come on, Rani, we're leaving.

20:09.074 --> 20:10.542
Yes. Yes, you are.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.446
You see, I have
received a special gift.
Observe!

20:17.382 --> 20:21.420
I can channel
all the power of the stars!

20:23.989 --> 20:26.892
Your choice, Sarah Jane.
Keep away from us,

20:29.861 --> 20:32.531
or the Ancient Lights
will destroy you!

20:33.098 --> 20:34.399
Get in!

20:34.466 --> 20:37.869
-Now she'll keep away.
-No, no, she's a Taurus.

20:37.936 --> 20:42.474
Among other things,
determined, brave.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.243
She'll keep interfering.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.545
I'll deal with her.

20:46.612 --> 20:49.147
No, no, I need you with me.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.784
I shall have to
use somebody else.

20:52.851 --> 20:57.022
Wait! Last night.
That boy sitting on her right.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.157
-Clyde Langer.
-Gemini.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.862
I'll see you then, Finney.
Laters.

21:06.932 --> 21:09.434
Clyde, we need to talk.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.704
-What?
-About your destiny.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.074
Stand still. Turn to me.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.978
You won't be needing that.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.153
-Mr Smith, I need...
-Mum? What's happened?

21:28.220 --> 21:29.721
We nearly got
zapped by Trueman.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.157
We need to find out
where he gets his power.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.559
He said "Ancient Lights,"
whatever that means.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.396
Mr Smith,
analyse the damage
to this fabric.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.730
What caused it?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.932
<i>The fabric has been burnt.</i>

21:41.133 --> 21:43.368
-By what?
<i>-By nothing.</i>

21:43.435 --> 21:44.770
That doesn't make any sense.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.571
<i>Nothing has burnt the fabric.</i>

21:46.638 --> 21:49.641
-But it's been burnt.
-By something
Mr Smith can't detect.

21:49.708 --> 21:53.145
Like Clyde said,
how can we detect something
we don't believe in?

21:53.211 --> 21:56.481
The power of
the Ancient Lights.
What if it is astrology?

21:56.548 --> 21:58.850
-What if astrology is true?
-It can't be true.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.986
It's completely contrary
to the laws of physics.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.888
I'll call Clyde.
He won't want to miss this.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.593
(STAMMERING) Whoa.
How did I get here?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.629
I made you want to come here.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.998
You're lucky.
It's your destiny.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.700
-(MOBILE PHONE RINGING)
-Oh!

22:14.766 --> 22:15.934
Rani calling!

22:16.134 --> 22:17.869
-Hey, give that back.
-Down.

22:19.071 --> 22:22.207
-Not today, thank you.
-(DISCONNECTS)

22:22.274 --> 22:25.277
-What will you do to me?
-Nothing to be afraid of.

22:25.343 --> 22:28.847
You have been chosen
to join my inner circle.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.683
Life is going to be
far less complicated for you.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.852
Accept the Ancient Lights.

22:38.757 --> 22:41.326
No answer.
It must be on Silent.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.196
He never puts it on Silent.
Not even in school.

22:44.262 --> 22:46.031
He's probably got
his headphones on.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.367
So, this energy.
We saw it. It exists.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.170
Hang on.
Astrology breaks
the laws of physics.

22:52.237 --> 22:53.638
What are you getting at?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.874
What if the Ancient Lights
come from somewhere else?

22:55.941 --> 23:00.011
Where the laws of
physics are different,
so they can break ours?

23:00.078 --> 23:02.280
That's like saying
you could break
the law of gravity.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.250
Maybe that's why
Mr Smith said
nothing burnt my jacket.

23:05.317 --> 23:09.187
What if the Ancient Lights
is a different kind of energy?

23:09.387 --> 23:11.089
No, Rani.
The laws of physics,

23:11.156 --> 23:14.192
-they're the same
across the universe.
-Our universe.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.528
What if the Ancient Lights
are from another one?

23:18.730 --> 23:20.932
I'll do as
you said, Mr Trueman.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.703
I know I can
rely on you, Clyde.

23:24.770 --> 23:29.841
Now we must be on our way.
One last performance.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.410
It wouldn't do
to keep the world waiting.

23:32.477 --> 23:36.948
Mr Smith said every galaxy
has its own form of astrology,
not just Earth.

23:37.015 --> 23:39.151
What if astrology
is a kind of memory

23:39.217 --> 23:41.186
-of a time before?
-Explain.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.089
Thirteen billion years ago,
the universe was created,

23:44.156 --> 23:45.924
a massive explosion,
the Big Bang.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.993
-What was there before?
-Nobody knows.

23:48.059 --> 23:49.628
What if there was
another universe?

23:49.694 --> 23:52.197
Where the laws of physics
were different
and astrology worked.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.266
And this energy
survived the Big Bang.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.968
The Ancient Lights,
so they're very ancient.

23:57.035 --> 23:58.870
What have they been doing
for 13 billion years?

23:58.937 --> 24:00.705
Why have they picked Trueman?

24:00.772 --> 24:03.542
<i>-May I make a suggestion?</i>
-Go ahead, Mr Smith.

24:03.608 --> 24:07.279
<i>If Luke's theory is correct,</i>
<i>the energy form</i>
<i>has been waiting</i>

24:07.345 --> 24:11.149
<i>for exactly the right</i>
<i>astrological conditions</i>
<i>across the universe.</i>

24:11.216 --> 24:14.619
<i>Trueman's birth chart</i>
<i>is a vital part</i>
<i>of that equation.</i>

24:14.686 --> 24:17.022
<i>He is the channel</i>
<i>the energy needs.</i>

24:17.088 --> 24:19.224
It needs him for what?
What does it want?

24:19.291 --> 24:23.028
It can't have waited
that long just to appear
on a stage in Acton.

24:23.094 --> 24:26.531
<i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>my media sensor reports</i>
<i>that Martin Trueman</i>

24:26.598 --> 24:28.967
<i>is about to appear live</i>
<i>on the television.</i>

24:29.034 --> 24:30.936
<i>-Shall I relay the image?</i>
-Yes, please.

24:33.038 --> 24:36.141
<i>We're here at</i>
<i>the New Theatre</i>
<i>in East Acton,</i>

24:36.208 --> 24:38.310
<i>where astrologer</i>
<i>Martin Trueman</i>

24:38.376 --> 24:42.480
<i>has been creating a buzz</i>
<i>with some amazing live shows.</i>

24:42.547 --> 24:44.516
-Hi, Martin.
-Hello, Lisa.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.219
Before the show,
I gave you my date of birth,

24:47.285 --> 24:49.321
so what can you
tell me about myself?

24:49.521 --> 24:52.757
<i>Lisa, you are</i>
<i>a very trusting person.</i>

24:52.824 --> 24:55.527
-I don't like this.
-It's only the
Psychic Channel.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.596
We probably
doubled their ratings
by switching on.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.465
MR SMITH: <i>Information!</i>
<i>This television programme</i>

25:00.532 --> 25:04.269
<i>is now being broadcast</i>
<i>on all channels</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

25:04.336 --> 25:07.672
Oh, it's him! Martin Trueman.

25:07.739 --> 25:10.408
-Why are you watching this?
-I wasn't.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.410
Must've sat on the remote.

25:12.477 --> 25:15.647
<i>...are using you</i>
<i>just to get what they want?</i>

25:15.714 --> 25:19.718
And you find yourself
somehow pushed aside.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.153
Again, that is so true.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.156
Yes, and it's very
convenient for me.

25:25.223 --> 25:29.427
You see, you are not
important any more.
You've served your purpose.

25:38.570 --> 25:39.871
Remove them.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.544
<i>That's better.</i>

25:46.611 --> 25:48.947
<i>Now, we can begin.</i>

25:49.014 --> 25:51.149
<i>This is a very important day.</i>

25:51.216 --> 25:52.450
(STATIC)

25:54.953 --> 25:56.554
<i>The most important day...</i>

25:56.621 --> 25:57.989
He can't be on
all the channels.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.424
Come on.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.027
Just one thing,
before we get started.

26:02.093 --> 26:04.930
I cast a horoscope
earlier today, for a...

26:04.996 --> 26:08.867
<i>A client.</i>
<i>And I think she</i>
<i>might be looking in.</i>

26:08.934 --> 26:12.671
<i>She's going to be</i>
<i>having quite a difficult</i>
<i>time of it right now.</i>

26:12.737 --> 26:15.941
<i>Her problem is</i>
<i>she can't help</i>
<i>asking questions.</i>

26:16.007 --> 26:18.276
-How is he doing it?
-Mr Smith?

26:18.343 --> 26:21.479
MR SMITH:
<i>I detect no interference</i>
<i>with the television signal.</i>

26:21.546 --> 26:25.350
How could you?
It's the power of the stars,
the old universe.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.986
<i>Interfering in</i>
<i>other people's affairs,</i>

26:28.053 --> 26:29.487
<i>she really should stop,</i>

26:30.822 --> 26:33.191
<i>or people could get hurt.</i>

26:33.258 --> 26:34.759
We're going to the theatre.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.761
How will we stop Trueman?

26:36.828 --> 26:39.130
You can't stop him.

26:39.197 --> 26:41.766
Clyde? Where have you been?

26:41.833 --> 26:45.570
I've turned to the stars.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.705
(RUMBLING)

26:50.008 --> 26:53.078
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
don't be scared.

26:53.144 --> 26:55.847
-Clyde!
-Clyde, what's happening?

26:55.914 --> 26:58.116
What's Trueman done to you?

26:58.183 --> 27:00.852
He's given me power.

27:03.488 --> 27:04.956
No! Clyde, no!

27:05.023 --> 27:07.225
Mr Smith, what's happening?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.995
MR SMITH:
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>

27:10.061 --> 27:11.596
<i>-Nothing is happening.</i>
-Clyde!

27:11.663 --> 27:14.366
<i>-Nothing is happening.</i>
-It's the dawning
of a new age.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.635
The power of
the Ancient Lights
is reborn!

27:17.702 --> 27:19.237
MR SMITH:
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>

27:19.304 --> 27:21.139
Welcome to the future.

27:21.206 --> 27:26.478
Sarah Jane,
you must be destroyed.

27:26.544 --> 27:29.381
MR SMITH:
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>

27:29.447 --> 27:30.849
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>

27:35.286 --> 27:37.088
TRUEMAN: I have
a message for the world.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.991
Children of Gemini,
join the Ancient Lights.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.027
Clyde, this thing that's
possessed you, it's alien.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.329
Sarah Jane!
It's got my mum.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.931
<i>Since the broadcast,</i>
<i>some people</i>
<i>have been hypnotised</i>

27:47.132 --> 27:48.800
<i>and have walked</i>
<i>out of their homes.</i>

27:48.867 --> 27:52.003
<i>Children of Leo,</i>
<i>join the circle.</i>

27:52.070 --> 27:54.472
They're taking over
all the star signs
one by one.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.909
My destiny is now.
