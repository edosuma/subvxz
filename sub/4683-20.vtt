WEBVTT

00:20.100 --> 00:22.533
I'll be back! I'm free!

00:45.800 --> 00:47.066
Dad..

00:47.133 --> 00:49.466
...where do babies come from?

00:49.533 --> 00:51.266
'Uh..'

00:51.333 --> 00:54.966
'Well, Mikey, that's sort of
a complicated story.'

00:55.033 --> 00:55.966
C-come here.

00:56.033 --> 00:59.600
First, there's this magic store.

00:59.666 --> 01:03.233
And then come the bees..

01:03.300 --> 01:05.366
...and the daisies.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.566
Snips, snails, and..

01:08.633 --> 01:11.466
...puppy dog tails.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.033
You whiny yuppies

01:14.100 --> 01:16.033
you call that a story?

01:17.666 --> 01:19.500
I'll give you a story.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.600
But first..

01:24.666 --> 01:27.133
...let's deal with daddy!

01:29.300 --> 01:32.266
S-so you see, son

01:32.333 --> 01:34.566
that's how babies are made.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.233
Yo, mama. What a crock!

01:51.433 --> 01:52.766
Fetch, Fido.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.766
Aw, the little kid's

02:03.833 --> 02:06.800
afraid of the dark!

02:06.866 --> 02:10.233
Now, that's something
I can make a story out of.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.233
Hello?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
Where is everybody?

03:05.433 --> 03:07.533
It's too dark in here.

03:28.733 --> 03:30.033
Hello?

03:50.400 --> 03:52.333
Anybody there?

04:05.966 --> 04:08.066
Right, naturally.

04:12.366 --> 04:14.566
'Are you alright?'

04:14.633 --> 04:16.700
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

04:18.033 --> 04:20.800
Well, no, actually.

04:20.900 --> 04:22.033
Hoo!

04:24.100 --> 04:25.633
Ooh.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.233
That was a really weird dream

04:27.300 --> 04:30.933
uh...about this kid

04:31.000 --> 04:32.866
and he's-he's trapped in this..

04:32.933 --> 04:35.633
...some sort of tunnel
and there's this creature

04:35.700 --> 04:39.533
who, who comes after him
and, and he runs and..

04:41.900 --> 04:43.433
What time is it?

04:43.500 --> 04:45.533
- It's noon, Michael.
- Ah!

04:45.600 --> 04:46.966
That would explain the, uh

04:47.033 --> 04:49.100
big bright thing
in the sky, then.

04:49.166 --> 04:52.400
- I give up.
- Hey, I win!

04:52.466 --> 04:54.433
Stop it. You know
what I'm talking about.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.066
This can't go on!

04:56.133 --> 04:58.500
You watch TV all night,
you sleep away the day

04:58.566 --> 05:00.000
you watch TV all afternoon--

05:00.066 --> 05:02.666
Uh, sometimes
I go to the movies.

05:02.733 --> 05:06.066
Michael, you have to find a job!

05:06.133 --> 05:08.200
Think about your future.

05:10.133 --> 05:13.466
I have struck out
on hundreds of job interviews.

05:13.533 --> 05:16.300
Listen to me, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to nag.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.200
I gotta go.

05:19.266 --> 05:20.966
Murray, the boss from hell
only gives us

05:21.033 --> 05:23.000
15 minutes for lunch.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.400
Let me see.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.433
"Great job, great hours

05:37.500 --> 05:38.866
great pay, great future."

05:38.933 --> 05:40.366
Yeah. "Call now."

06:00.100 --> 06:03.233
Oh, "Crabmen From Venus?"
Is it good?

06:03.300 --> 06:06.233
I'll tell you, man,
no peer, no pay!

06:06.300 --> 06:08.366
Well, actually,
if you want my honest--

06:08.433 --> 06:10.300
Is it good? Are you kidding?

06:10.366 --> 06:12.466
This thing is a sci-fi classic.

06:12.533 --> 06:15.266
It has got monsters
like you wouldn't believe.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.133
Blood, gore, guts,
slime, rape, pillage.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.366
You name it, it's got it.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.133
What? I have small children.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.033
And yet..

06:25.100 --> 06:28.100
...it is a real family film.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.433
I mean, it's charming.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.133
Poignant...heartwarming.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.700
It's about a boy
and his crabs.

06:37.766 --> 06:38.733
Three dollars a day

06:38.800 --> 06:40.833
and have it in by 11 tomorrow.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.133
Don't forget to rewind!

06:52.700 --> 06:54.700
Somebody wanna
get that phone, please?

06:59.233 --> 07:01.200
So, uh, how about it?

07:02.433 --> 07:05.433
'Dinner, a little Jacuzzi?'

07:06.533 --> 07:09.900
Some late night
satellite dish TV?

07:09.966 --> 07:12.033
Don't listen to the slime.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.200
Congratulate me.

07:15.266 --> 07:16.633
I got a job.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.466
Terrific! Where?

07:18.533 --> 07:19.833
There was this ad in the paper

07:19.900 --> 07:22.166
and when I called up,
this guy hired me.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.033
I'll see you tonight.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.333
Hey, yo!

07:32.266 --> 07:34.366
Look, I'm..
I-I got no change, okay?

07:34.433 --> 07:36.833
I'm-I'm practically homeless
myself, so..

07:36.900 --> 07:39.866
- Bowman, right?
- Yeah.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.800
H-how did you know my name?

07:41.866 --> 07:44.600
You told me.
On the phone, remember?

07:44.666 --> 07:47.466
I'm Al Canian,
lord of the underworld.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.366
Lord of the underworld?
You're the guy that hired me?

07:50.433 --> 07:52.300
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

07:52.366 --> 07:53.466
Al, where are you going?

07:53.533 --> 07:54.933
Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.033
- Come on.
- No, no, this is a mistake!

07:57.100 --> 08:00.133
"It's a mistake."
It's no mistake! Come on!

08:00.200 --> 08:02.200
Step into my office, kiddo.

08:07.566 --> 08:09.600
Okay. It's just a job.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.866
It's just a job.

08:11.933 --> 08:13.100
I'm not gonna have a secretary

08:13.166 --> 08:15.200
but it's...a job.

08:15.266 --> 08:16.333
Hello?

08:21.566 --> 08:24.266
Okay, take off your clothes.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.266
Uh, take off my clothes?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.333
Why?

08:28.433 --> 08:30.000
'Cause there's where
you're gonna be working.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.866
'Yeah, like I always say'

08:39.933 --> 08:42.633
'wonder what the world
would be like without sewers.'

08:42.700 --> 08:44.900
Before sewers
there was nothing, you know?

08:46.133 --> 08:47.766
Think about it.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.100
Personal hygiene used to be, uh

08:50.166 --> 08:52.433
to say the least,
a little bit crude.

08:52.500 --> 08:53.700
Then came
the industrial revolution.

08:53.766 --> 08:54.966
As that progressed

08:55.033 --> 08:56.700
more and more people
started living in one area

08:56.766 --> 08:59.066
Disease became
a major problem.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.200
Man, we need sewers, kiddo

09:01.266 --> 09:04.500
Al...what exactly is my job

09:04.566 --> 09:07.866
here, in humanity's
lower intestine?

09:07.933 --> 09:10.600
Oh, yeah, look for cracks,
smell for gas, uh

09:10.666 --> 09:12.133
watch for blockages.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.666
Depending on the rainfall
you're gonna have to, uh

09:13.733 --> 09:16.833
check valves and, uh,
re-channel pipelines.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.633
Overflow control,
you understand?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.700
Overflow control.

09:20.766 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, but, uh,
you gotta be careful.

09:24.066 --> 09:26.600
It ain't all
a bowel of cherries down here.

09:28.033 --> 09:29.466
That's a joke. You get it?

09:29.533 --> 09:31.700
Ah, a bowel of cherries.

09:31.766 --> 09:33.833
Good one, Your Lordship.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.933
Yeah, the centipedes are okay,
the snakes aren't too bad.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.466
After a few bites
you build up an immunity.

09:38.533 --> 09:41.166
It's, uh, the alligators.

09:41.233 --> 09:43.533
Yeah, right.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.100
So don't believe me.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.900
You see, folks buy these
little gators for their kids

09:47.966 --> 09:50.766
at the pet stores and circuses
and like that.

09:50.833 --> 09:54.366
And, uh, they get big,
they get loose.

09:54.433 --> 09:56.566
They go to the gutters,
they jump down the toilets

09:56.633 --> 09:58.400
Either way,
they wind up down here.

09:58.466 --> 10:02.100
And they grow and they breed.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.233
And they turn white becaus
there's no light down here

10:05.300 --> 10:08.666
- Albino alligators? Come on.
- You don't laugh.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.266
I got a three-inch scar
on my right calf to prove it.

10:12.733 --> 10:14.666
Hey, please, will ya?

10:14.733 --> 10:16.900
- I'm sorry.
- What's the matter with you?

10:16.966 --> 10:18.533
I'm sorry, Al, I..

10:18.600 --> 10:19.600
It's just
I'm having some problem

10:19.666 --> 10:20.933
with the dark, that's all.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.400
The dark?

10:22.466 --> 10:23.800
That's something

10:23.866 --> 10:25.233
you're gonna
have to get over fast.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.633
Come on.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.633
'Hey, Al.'

10:31.900 --> 10:33.133
Al?

10:50.500 --> 10:51.533
What is it?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.533
Did I mention that I was working
for a nutbar?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.100
Perhaps you've heard of him,
Al Canian

10:55.166 --> 10:56.266
lord of the underworld.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.066
Did I mention that?

10:58.133 --> 11:00.633
Only about
half a dozen times tonight

11:04.100 --> 11:06.900
I mean, the man actually owns
a white rubber alligator.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.900
He used it to initiate
new recruits.

11:08.966 --> 11:11.066
Oh, it sounds to me
like he has a sense of humor.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.600
I don't know
what you're so concerned about.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.666
I'm having a little trouble
with the dark, okay?

11:17.733 --> 11:19.600
Like, I'm terrified of it.

11:19.666 --> 11:21.800
You're acting like a kid.

11:22.766 --> 11:26.066
Linda...I just spent my day

11:26.133 --> 11:29.233
in the dark with Mr. Wackoid
and his rubber pal.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.333
So please allow me

11:30.400 --> 11:33.633
this one little
childhood phobia, okay?

11:33.700 --> 11:36.566
I have a job now
and not a very respectable one.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.066
But it will pay the bills.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.066
I'm sorry.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.466
And I'm proud of you,
I really am.

11:43.533 --> 11:47.000
Working in the sewer
is nothing to be ashamed o

11:47.066 --> 11:49.700
as long as you take a shower
before you come home.

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
Oh.

11:51.866 --> 11:53.033
That was cold.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.300
Oh, oh, oh, poor baby.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.466
I'll protect you.

11:58.533 --> 12:00.966
- I know what you need.
- Hm.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.266
Something to keep
your mind off it

12:03.333 --> 12:05.133
something to help you sleep.

12:09.633 --> 12:12.233
Couldn't we do this
with the lights on?

12:36.533 --> 12:39.400
Mom says
it's just my imagination.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.333
'Nothing to fear.'

12:52.466 --> 12:54.033
Easy for her to say.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.600
I like this, don't you?
This is good, don't you think?

13:06.666 --> 13:09.000
Makes the room, like,
a whole lot...brighter.

13:09.066 --> 13:11.066
Michael, this has got to stop!

13:11.133 --> 13:14.300
Please, Linda, please.
Just for tonight, please.

13:25.966 --> 13:27.333
'Pay attention, kid.'

13:27.400 --> 13:29.300
We got a blockage
on the 3rd main.

13:29.366 --> 13:30.933
That's under
the old part of town.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.166
Now, nobody's checked it out
for a couple years.

13:33.233 --> 13:35.666
The back up valve
is right there.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.300
All you gotta do is open it,
and you're done. Clean flush.

13:38.366 --> 13:40.033
You got it?

13:40.100 --> 13:42.466
Clean flush. I got it.

13:42.533 --> 13:43.933
Good boy.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.333
Aren't you coming?

13:54.400 --> 13:57.433
No, no, you're going solo today.
Have fun.

13:59.533 --> 14:00.900
Solo, huh?

14:03.700 --> 14:04.833
Huh.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.100
Ed Norton, eat
your heart out, huh?

14:08.700 --> 14:11.166
Hey, Ralph.

14:11.233 --> 14:13.266
Ha, I got this licked.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.700
Hey, I got this beat, eh?

14:15.766 --> 14:18.900
I'm smarter
than the average bear.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.233
Babbling Billy.
Yeah, that's what I am.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.333
Okay. No problem.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.733
It's just
a little walk in the park.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.900
It's just a walk in the woods.

14:35.766 --> 14:37.733
It's just a walk on the beach.

14:39.033 --> 14:40.300
It's just a walk in..

14:45.766 --> 14:48.033
It's just a walk.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
Now, I've seen that before.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.300
Oh, no.
God, no, please. No.

15:38.533 --> 15:40.533
Al, Al, Al,
there's something down there

15:40.600 --> 15:41.800
i-in the old valve.

15:41.866 --> 15:43.600
There was this hatchway
and it opened by itself

15:43.666 --> 15:45.500
and then this thing
came at me, it came at me with--

15:45.566 --> 15:47.566
Hold it!

15:47.633 --> 15:49.766
Okay, take it easy, don't worry.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.200
Did you get the valve open?

15:52.266 --> 15:55.433
No, I didn't get the valve open!

15:55.500 --> 15:56.866
Okay, look, don't worry,
it'll be alright

15:56.933 --> 15:58.433
as long as it don't rain
and overflow.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
- Al, Al, Al.
- Look, go home.

16:00.666 --> 16:01.800
I..

16:03.600 --> 16:05.033
Go home.

16:14.566 --> 16:16.066
I don't know.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.333
This one's one of the
pretty tight

16:17.400 --> 16:18.833
huh, Ralphie?

16:29.433 --> 16:32.500
'Okay, that's it.'

16:33.966 --> 16:35.900
Come and get me, sucker.

16:37.833 --> 16:40.033
No, no, no!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.733
Michael, that's it!
It's either me or the lights!

16:42.800 --> 16:45.066
Please, Linda, I'm going nuts.

16:45.133 --> 16:46.933
I understand, okay?
I'm sympathetic.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.233
But you kept me up
all last night.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.466
I need to get some sleep!

16:50.533 --> 16:53.366
Now, get a grip
on yourself, Michael.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.700
I'm here.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.833
It's okay, I'm here.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.766
You're right, you're right.
You're right.

17:04.733 --> 17:05.833
That does it!

17:05.900 --> 17:08.133
Please, Linda,
just one little light!

17:08.200 --> 17:09.766
You're 25 years old, Michael.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.000
You're not supposed
to be afraid of the dark.

17:12.066 --> 17:13.766
- You're a grown man!
- L-Linda, please.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.900
- Just for tonight.
- I don't care.

17:15.966 --> 17:17.233
If I have to get on the bu

17:17.300 --> 17:19.800
I am gonna get some sleep.

17:19.866 --> 17:20.833
Linda..

17:20.900 --> 17:21.866
...all the men in the worl

17:21.933 --> 17:23.833
I have to date..

17:23.900 --> 17:24.866
- Linda.
- Goodbye, Michael.

17:24.933 --> 17:27.166
Linda. Linda!

17:37.633 --> 17:39.633
It'll be okay, kid

17:39.700 --> 17:41.933
as long as it doesn't rain.

18:02.566 --> 18:04.200
Hey, kiddo.

18:04.266 --> 18:06.666
It rained last night.

18:06.733 --> 18:09.866
Valve, old tunnel.

18:09.933 --> 18:10.866
I'm on it.

18:12.666 --> 18:13.700
Clean flush.

19:13.466 --> 19:14.933
What the hell?

19:18.533 --> 19:19.900
Okay, I'm outta here.

20:04.466 --> 20:05.500
Are you alright, mister?

20:07.300 --> 20:08.933
I think so.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.366
What the hell is that thing?

20:11.433 --> 20:13.833
The thing in your closet

20:13.900 --> 20:15.666
under your bed in the dark

20:15.733 --> 20:17.700
It's whatever scares you.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.800
- Who are you?
- Michael Bowman.

20:22.866 --> 20:26.000
Oh. Hold it, okay?

20:26.066 --> 20:28.566
I'mMichael Bowman.

20:28.633 --> 20:30.233
How'd you get my gun?

20:33.466 --> 20:36.400
- How did you getmygun?
- I don't know.

20:36.466 --> 20:39.900
You kids should not
play with guns.

20:39.966 --> 20:43.600
Grown-ups should not be afraid
of the dark.

20:43.666 --> 20:46.233
If you are me,
you are me grown up.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.500
I can't believe
what a geek I'm gonna be.

20:48.566 --> 20:50.066
Hey, do you think growing up

20:50.133 --> 20:52.733
is like playing a Nintendo game?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.733
You know, my mom..

20:54.800 --> 20:56.766
...our mom always says

20:56.833 --> 20:58.933
you have to face
what scares you.

21:01.033 --> 21:02.533
She's right.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.133
Here.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.133
Keep this for luck.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.766
You will need it.

21:09.833 --> 21:13.233
And, um,
sorry about the geek crack

21:13.300 --> 21:15.233
Oh. Oh, no sweat.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.400
One question.

21:21.466 --> 21:23.833
- If you're really me, that is.
- Hm.

21:25.466 --> 21:27.933
Girls. We finally get one,
don't we?

21:29.066 --> 21:31.933
- Yeah.
- Worth the wait?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.433
Yeah.

21:44.533 --> 21:47.633
Clean flush. I'm on it.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.666
Al, I got it!

21:51.733 --> 21:55.233
I got the valve! Clean flush!

21:55.300 --> 21:58.433
Take it easy.
You done good, kid.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.666
You done good.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.700
'Yeah, victim fell down
a sewer entrance.'

22:05.766 --> 22:07.500
'Condition critical,
we're coming in.'

22:09.733 --> 22:11.066
Hey!

22:15.233 --> 22:16.533
What a fall!

22:17.700 --> 22:19.633
It was no fall.

22:20.466 --> 22:22.500
Albino alligators.

22:24.666 --> 22:26.333
Gets 'em every time.

22:39.300 --> 22:43.033
There's nothing to fear
but fear. Trust me.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.200
You know, anyone can talk to me.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.533
I don't know what he was sayin'.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.833
What do you mean
you don't have "Royal Blend?"

23:19.900 --> 23:22.000
- Everybody has it.
- Sorry, kid.

23:22.066 --> 23:24.333
But if I ain't got it,
I ain't got it.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.600
I mean, what do
you want me to do?

23:25.666 --> 23:27.133
Sneak into somebody's hous

23:27.200 --> 23:28.966
and wrestle it out of their VCR?

23:29.033 --> 23:31.066
- Okay, huh?
- Fine.

23:31.133 --> 23:32.966
Then I'll just have
my mom drive me over

23:33.033 --> 23:35.666
to some other
stupid video place.

23:35.733 --> 23:36.800
Wait a minute.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.500
Here. Try this.

23:40.566 --> 23:42.733
What is it?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.400
"Chainsaw Bikers"
that'll knock your socks off.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.933
Yeah, right.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.200
Hey, come on.
It's got babes and bazookas.

23:49.266 --> 23:50.600
You can't lose.

23:55.933 --> 23:57.633
Hey, kid, you wanna work for me?

23:57.700 --> 23:58.833
For you, scuz?

23:58.900 --> 24:01.466
No way. I make more
with my allowance.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.266
And my parents are cheap.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.033
Oh, yeah, right!
Don't forget to rewind!

24:07.800 --> 24:10.200
- Where the hell have you been?
- I've been at the hospital.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.000
My boyfriend's had an accident.

24:12.066 --> 24:13.233
He's really messed up.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.133
Oh..

24:15.200 --> 24:17.600
Lover boy's out of action, huh?

24:17.666 --> 24:19.400
Leave me alone, please.

24:19.466 --> 24:23.433
Mm, I love a little
resistance when I lay pipe.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.233
It heightens the rush.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.500
Back off, toad.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.700
Toad?

24:29.766 --> 24:32.366
Wanna play leapfrog?

24:32.433 --> 24:33.733
It's for you.

24:37.233 --> 24:39.400
- Yello.
- 'Sexual harassment hotline.'

24:39.466 --> 24:40.766
'May I help you?'

24:44.466 --> 24:46.333
Hey, John Love.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.566
I pay you
to watch for shoplifters

24:48.633 --> 24:50.533
not "Suzy Suckle Seattle."

24:50.600 --> 24:53.200
Yes, sir, Mr. McKenna.

24:53.266 --> 24:56.466
Out of here!
Take your clumsy outta here!

24:59.133 --> 25:00.600
I need a manicure.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.033
Raymond Jordan,
Black Night Audio?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.100
Do you have a minute?

25:05.166 --> 25:06.833
Oh, I'm a busy man, Mr. Jordan.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.000
I'm a busy man.

25:08.066 --> 25:10.300
I'm a collector
for Black Night Audio.

25:10.366 --> 25:12.266
You owe us
a lot of money, Mr. McKenna.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.233
For a self help
audio cassettes we advanced you.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.566
Ha ha.

25:15.633 --> 25:17.433
Audio cassettes.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.233
Sorry, but I'm in the, uh,
video cassette business.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.500
So can you, uh

25:21.566 --> 25:23.400
show me a contract.

25:23.466 --> 25:25.166
No...because you already

25:25.233 --> 25:26.533
sold the cassettes.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.133
And as for a contract

25:28.200 --> 25:29.966
we shook hands.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.166
Art of the deal, Mr. Jordan.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.533
Art of the deal.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.400
Sotha

25:50.366 --> 25:52.633
"How To Be A Mega Success

25:52.700 --> 25:54.300
or your money back."

25:55.500 --> 25:57.466
It's a joke, right?

25:59.100 --> 26:01.633
This is special.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.066
This is the prototype
of our new subliminal

26:04.133 --> 26:06.800
sleep-learnin'
light enhancement tape.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.300
It is designed to activate
the innate inner talent

26:09.366 --> 26:11.133
of the person who uses it.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.166
Bring them to the surface.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.833
Use it tonight
when you go to bed.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.633
With your knowledge
of making money..

26:18.700 --> 26:20.500
...if it works for you..

26:20.566 --> 26:22.200
...imagine..

26:22.266 --> 26:25.866
...you can wake up tomorro
and become a rich man.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.900
Beyond your wildest dreams

26:30.100 --> 26:31.600
Eh, I don't know.

26:31.666 --> 26:33.600
I mean, I'm a busy man.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.166
What's the hook?

26:39.233 --> 26:40.533
Maybe you'll..

26:41.500 --> 26:43.033
...square your bill?

26:43.100 --> 26:45.466
Carry the line of them.

26:45.533 --> 26:47.000
What do you say?

26:51.933 --> 26:53.800
No strings.

26:53.866 --> 26:55.333
No strings.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.400
A poem

27:04.066 --> 27:06.900
"I once met a guy who was sleaze

27:06.966 --> 27:10.433
"Whose throat
I then slit with much ease

"He thought he had smarts

"Till I cut off his parts

"And then all he had left

27:17.800 --> 27:20.300
were his .."

Daddy?

28:37.466 --> 28:39.633
Where did we go wrong?

28:39.700 --> 28:41.033
Wrong?

28:41.100 --> 28:42.766
What wrong?

28:42.833 --> 28:44.300
We failed you, son.

28:45.366 --> 28:47.233
I'm a success.

29:01.566 --> 29:03.933
Ate his spinach, made his bed!

29:04.633 --> 29:06.233
Not enough discipline!

29:07.000 --> 29:08.533
Son?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.033
Wait a minute.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.800
The two of you are dead.

29:14.433 --> 29:17.366
This is going
to hurt you much worse

29:17.433 --> 29:19.533
than it's going to hurt us, son.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600

was that all about?

29:39.400 --> 29:40.533
Rebecca.

29:42.733 --> 29:44.700
Honey, I just had
the weirdest dream.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.733
I was a kid again and..

29:48.933 --> 29:50.633
...my parents came into my room

29:50.700 --> 29:52.300
and they wonked off my..

29:53.866 --> 29:55.133
Oh.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.633
How stupid of me.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.033
You're my girl.

30:02.766 --> 30:04.500
With the blood test together

30:04.566 --> 30:06.800
we have great safe sex.

flat nose piece of

coagulated yellow boogers and I

30:32.533 --> 30:34.066
I, yo man,
I'm sick of your insults

30:34.133 --> 30:38.300
you peer, you bossin' me
like you own the whole world!

30:38.366 --> 30:40.366
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa.
W-w-wait a, wait a minute. I..

30:40.433 --> 30:42.133
H-h-how about a raise, huh?

That's it.

31:02.533 --> 31:04.433
That's it,
that security guard is fired

Huh?

31:24.666 --> 31:25.800
Huh?

31:37.700 --> 31:40.666
What kind of hangover is this?

32:04.733 --> 32:06.433
Mm, mm?

32:06.500 --> 32:08.133
Mm..

32:08.200 --> 32:09.300
Mm..

32:18.133 --> 32:19.233
Oh..

32:44.433 --> 32:45.533
Dream.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.400
Oh, it was just a dream.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.033
Hello, maggot!

33:21.333 --> 33:24.566
You really had me
going there for a while.

33:24.633 --> 33:27.766
- Did I?
- 'Oh, yeah, sure.'

33:27.833 --> 33:30.433
Dream after dream after dream.

33:30.500 --> 33:34.166
Ooh, cool effect. Ha ha.

33:34.233 --> 33:37.366
Still don't get
the drift, do you, Murray?

33:37.433 --> 33:39.833
- What drift?
- 'You don't wake up.'

33:39.900 --> 33:41.900
Till Isay&lt;row16

33:42.666 --> 33:44.366
Go suck an egg.

33:44.433 --> 33:47.133
Ooh. Mm-mm.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.966
Bad attitude.

33:49.033 --> 33:51.733
You know that's somethin'
you should work on.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.866
'You got no respect.'

33:53.933 --> 33:55.666
'You use people'

33:55.733 --> 33:57.200
'you hurt people'

33:57.266 --> 33:59.266
and it means nothin' to you.

33:59.333 --> 34:01.300
But that can change.

34:01.366 --> 34:02.933
In fact

34:03.000 --> 34:05.100
I'll even help you change.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.333
Back to normal? Uh-uh.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.333
Not so fast, brother-in-law.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.600
You..

34:29.666 --> 34:32.466
Get out of my dream.

34:32.533 --> 34:34.133
Get out!

34:35.333 --> 34:37.033
Wake up.

34:37.100 --> 34:38.533
Wake up.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.800
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake the hell up!

34:41.866 --> 34:43.766
You wake up

34:43.833 --> 34:45.800
when Iwantyou to wak

34:47.633 --> 34:48.933
Oh, no.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.366
Everything is gonna be alright.

34:54.433 --> 34:58.133
Everything is gonna be just fine

34:58.200 --> 35:00.100
because I am going

35:00.166 --> 35:02.833
to will you out of my mind

35:03.766 --> 35:05.433
Om..

35:05.500 --> 35:07.600
Oh, will me a pepperoni pizza,
will you, Murray?

35:11.633 --> 35:13.433
Oh, this isn't possible.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.000
It isn't.

35:15.066 --> 35:16.466
What do you want from me?

35:16.533 --> 35:18.400
What are you doing to me?

35:18.466 --> 35:21.133
We have been down this block

35:21.200 --> 35:22.933
brother-in-law.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.933
Subliminal manipulation?

35:26.100 --> 35:27.700
Power of suggestion?

35:29.233 --> 35:30.666
The tape.

35:30.733 --> 35:32.033
It was a bullet

35:32.100 --> 35:34.066
with your name on it.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.433
So..

35:35.500 --> 35:38.133
...Murraybaby!

35:38.200 --> 35:39.400
You best..

35:40.033 --> 35:42.100
...go with the flow.

35:42.166 --> 35:45.166
Getwiththe program.

35:45.233 --> 35:48.233
Because your subconscious

35:48.300 --> 35:49.366
is mine!

35:57.166 --> 35:58.433
Murray, baby.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.833
That won't do any good.
This is a dream.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.933
And that is the dream
version of the tape.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.533
The real you
is still lying in bed.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.533
Stillsnoozing.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.266
While the real tape
is stillrolling along

36:12.333 --> 36:14.600
and rolling along

36:14.666 --> 36:16.766
and along and along.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.366
Alright!&lt;TO

36:19.433 --> 36:21.000
I surrender!

36:21.066 --> 36:23.166
Uncle! Are you happy now? Huh?

36:23.233 --> 36:25.033
You happy? You won! Okay?

36:25.100 --> 36:26.700
I give up!

36:26.766 --> 36:28.800
What do you want?

36:28.866 --> 36:31.500
What you owe us.

36:32.366 --> 36:34.800
Half your store, your money.

36:34.866 --> 36:36.700
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!

36:36.766 --> 36:38.500
You're dreamin' now, pal!

36:38.566 --> 36:39.566
Never!

36:41.000 --> 36:43.400
Have it your way.

36:43.466 --> 36:46.233
The Black Night
collection department

36:46.300 --> 36:48.333
will pick up from here.

36:49.733 --> 36:51.966
Finalpayment

36:52.033 --> 36:53.033

36:57.900 --> 36:59.833
Just let 'em tr..

37:15.900 --> 37:17.433
Oh.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.900
Hold them off for me, pal.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.833
I've been here before.

40:05.233 --> 40:07.600
I've been here before.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.700
And I didn't like it
the last time either.

40:14.966 --> 40:16.400
Oh, no!

40:38.966 --> 40:41.366
No.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.733
&nbsp;
No!

40:48.700 --> 40:50.700
Okay! I give up!

40:50.766 --> 40:53.133
Uncle!

40:53.200 --> 40:55.166
Murray MacNeil surrenders!

40:55.233 --> 40:57.200
Are you happy?

40:59.333 --> 41:00.933
I give up!

41:14.600 --> 41:16.533
Need a lift?

41:31.566 --> 41:33.433
Had enough?

41:33.500 --> 41:36.600
Alright. Okay!

41:36.666 --> 41:38.400
You win, I give up!

41:38.466 --> 41:40.700
Do you agree

41:40.766 --> 41:42.833
Yes! Done!

41:42.900 --> 41:45.300

half your assets.

41:45.366 --> 41:46.733

41:46.800 --> 41:48.433
Anything! I'll do anything!

41:48.500 --> 41:51.800
Just let me wake up please!

41:51.866 --> 41:53.133
Get out.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.833
All of that
only took 25 minutes?

42:21.300 --> 42:22.600
Okay, pal.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.500
You win.

42:24.566 --> 42:27.133

42:54.700 --> 42:56.766

down to the store.

42:56.833 --> 42:57.900
Now.

42:57.966 --> 42:59.733
Then everything will be fine.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.633
Everything's gonna be copacetic.
Everything's gonna be cool.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.100

43:30.900 --> 43:31.900
No! It's me!

'Operator, operator.'

43:51.766 --> 43:53.700
'Operator,
a man about to go Babylon!'

43:55.266 --> 43:56.766
Oh, no. Boss.

43:56.833 --> 44:00.600
- I just shot you?
- You're fired, you putz.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.966
Oh, no!

44:11.033 --> 44:12.333
No way! But..

44:13.400 --> 44:15.566
I'm still dreaming?

44:15.633 --> 44:17.633

44:17.700 --> 44:21.233
Alright! Now you're catchin' on!

44:21.300 --> 44:23.366
Very good.

44:25.866 --> 44:29.066
A-and I owe you

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
We shook on it!

44:33.666 --> 44:35.066
What was it you told me

44:35.133 --> 44:37.100

44:37.166 --> 44:39.033
"Art of the deal."

44:41.700 --> 44:44.133
