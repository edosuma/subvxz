-What's this?
-Thanks...

38:15.710 --> 38:18.702
...for showing me Smallville
had more to offer than a tax break.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.088
It's a little something from the movie.
Every superhero needs one.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.917
I signed onto Warrior Angel
for publicity and a paycheck.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.715
But after meeting you...

38:28.890 --> 38:32.553
...l'm starting to believe
that heroes really do exist.

38:38.066 --> 38:41.229
There's something special
about this one, Lana. Hold on to him.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.900
I sure hope that comment
about a sequel was a joke.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.872
You okay?

38:57.460 --> 38:59.917
Just thinking about what Ben said.

39:00.088 --> 39:05.754
Oh, Lana, don't. Ben was a crazy fan
who got locked up in Belle Reve.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.211
He needed hope. And he's not wrong.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.802
Millions of people look up
to Warrior Angel.

39:13.101 --> 39:16.343
What if those people could look up
to you instead?

39:18.231 --> 39:21.223
Lana, there's not even a million people
in Smallville.

39:24.863 --> 39:28.276
Clark, I just wanna grab onto you...

39:28.450 --> 39:30.862
...and never let you go.

39:32.162 --> 39:35.529
But one day the world will need you
more than I do.

39:35.957 --> 39:39.666
And I don't wanna be the one
holding you here.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.053
I'm not going anywhere.

39:49.929 --> 39:52.261
For the ﬁrst time in my life,
I have everything...

39:52.432 --> 39:55.515
...and it's right here
on this farm with you.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.859
Okay.

41:34.576 --> 41:36.567
