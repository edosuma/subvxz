10:17.100 --> 10:18.400
I didn't do it.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.600
You didn't do what?
it doesn't matter what.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.000
Where were you then ????

10:22.000 --> 10:22.700
I was.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.200
So ???

10:24.200 --> 10:26.000
Happy hour.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.600
Little neighborhood place
drinking belfast carbombs

10:28.600 --> 10:30.300
With some
of my westie pals.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.500
You got anyone that can
verify that for me?

10:33.500 --> 10:37.200
Yeah. i got about 30 people
or so can.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.100
Conservative estimate.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.300
How come
i got this crazy hunch

10:41.300 --> 10:44.300
That most of those people
got records a lot like yours?

10:44.700 --> 10:47.600
Well, i wasn't drinking tea
at the plaza.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.000
Look, u want more elblwiess.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.400
Give me an hour or so,
i'll see what i can do.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.700
Must be
pretty well connected.

10:56.700 --> 11:01.500
Friends in high places.
who's mary with the manicure?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.800
I know he's not a cop,
not with that haircut.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.000
I'm assisting detective beckett
in the investigation.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.400
Assisting?

11:08.900 --> 11:11.800
What's the matter, sweetie? you
can't hack it out there alone?

11:12.400 --> 11:13.800
You wanna play?

11:17.300 --> 11:19.100
Let's play.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.100
I got an ex-con with a gun

11:22.100 --> 11:25.500
And two fresh homicides
just looking for a home.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.400
You can fish all you want,
detective.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.100
Smart fish don't bite.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.400
We could hold him
on the gun,

11:38.400 --> 11:41.100
But there's no match with
ballistics on mrs. delgado.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.500
And without other evidence to
link him to the other homicide-

11:43.500 --> 11:45.600
I'll find something, sir.
not if his alibi checks out.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.000
Sir, it's just pots and kettles.
on the last robbery, not the first.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.900
Mitchell was being arraigned
on an unrelated burglary

11:50.900 --> 11:52.600
The same day this crew struck.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.000
Unless you can break his alibi
on this one, he's a dead end.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.800
You gotta watch
those silhouettes.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.600
They can be shifty
little bastards.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.800
Do you mind?
i'm trying to concentrate.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.400
Man, when i hit a wall, all i
got's one of those stress balls

12:09.400 --> 12:11.200
And internet porn.
castle-

12:11.200 --> 12:13.800
Look, i get it, all right?
you made a promise

12:13.800 --> 12:15.300
To a daughter
to find her mother's killer.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.700
It doesn't take freud
to see what's what.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.600
But you're gonna run up
some blind alleys

12:19.600 --> 12:23.800
Before you get out of the maze. look, as much
as i appreciate your folksy dr. phil aphorisms,

12:23.800 --> 12:25.500
I just wanna-

12:26.100 --> 12:27.500
Wouldn't it be
more of a challenge

12:27.500 --> 12:29.500
If they
weren't standing still?

12:32.900 --> 12:37.000
Okay, castle.
you show me how it's done.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.200
All yours.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.000
It's not a duel,
scaramouche.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.200
Here.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.200
Square off to the target.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
Feet
shoulder-distance apart.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.100
Okay. gauntlet your
right fist in your left palm.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.900
Shot too soon.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.500
Yeah, well...

13:06.500 --> 13:08.400
You know, we could always
just cuddle, castle.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.100
Oh, funny.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.600
And a smile. good.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.800
That's better.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.600
You know, i, uh, came down
to ask you if i could, uh,

13:21.600 --> 13:24.900
Take home some of those
stolen property photos.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.900
Photos of the jewelry?
why?

13:26.900 --> 13:29.200
I don't know. i just thought
it might spark something.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.500
That kinda hurt.
tell you what.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
You put any of the next three
in the ten ring,

13:35.900 --> 13:38.200
And i will give you the files. yeah?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.700
Yeah.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.300
You're a very good teacher.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.500
Hey, dad. hey, how was
your date with owen?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.800
Dad, it wasn't a date.
it was a study group.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.300
Okay, how many in the
group? just the two of us.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.100
Pilfering evidence again,
i see.

14:05.100 --> 14:08.000
<i>borrowing. and these
are just copies. mm-hmm.</i>

14:08.000 --> 14:09.800
Insurance companies
like to maintain photos

14:09.800 --> 14:11.400
Of pieces like these
for identification

14:11.400 --> 14:12.600
In case anything
gets lost or stolen.

14:12.600 --> 14:15.500
Hello, gorgeous! ooh!

14:15.500 --> 14:17.300
Where have you been
all my life?

14:17.400 --> 14:18.500
You know, i'm thinking
of installing

14:18.500 --> 14:24.400
A new security system, maybe even a panic
room. panic room? what for, panic attacks?

14:24.900 --> 14:25.700
If anyone comes,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.200
We'll beat them off
with swords.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.400
Or pens, since they're mightier. no,
i'm serious. i just want us to be safe.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.500
Oh, life isn't safe,
especially not in new york-

14:35.500 --> 14:36.700
Cranes collapse,

14:36.700 --> 14:38.900
Air conditioners fall out
of the sky.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.100
In the end, there's just
a few short years.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.200
The most you can do
is make the most of it

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
Before something
knocks you down.

14:45.700 --> 14:49.700
"people living deeply
have no fear of death."

14:50.300 --> 14:52.800
Anais nin? mother, how many
of those have you had?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.200
Oh, shh.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.500
These are
pretty incredible pieces.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
You wouldn't use
a normal fence for these.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.400
You'd need someone
with impeccable taste,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.900
Someone who appreciated
their value,

15:02.900 --> 15:06.600
Someone who had high-end
buyer connections. powell.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.400
Oh, now there was a man.
and you had to ruin it.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.800
Who's powell? that was years ago. i'm
sure he's forgotten all about that.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.500
Who's powell? forgotten? you
forced him into retirement.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.500
You ruined his life. he threatened to
slit your throat. dad, who's powell?

15:20.500 --> 15:21.900
You remember
that character of mine-

15:21.900 --> 15:24.800
Um, bentley silver? the
jewel thief in "storm rising"?

15:24.800 --> 15:29.300
Yeah, i kinda based him on powell. kind
of? you stole the man's entire life.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.200
And then your father,
genius that he is,

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
Thanked him
in the acknowledgments,

15:32.600 --> 15:35.300
Completely blowing his cover.
yeah, he can't still be mad.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.400
I'm gonna go see him.
dad!

15:37.400 --> 15:41.800
No, i'll be okay. don't worry. i think it'll
be fine. if he doesn't slit your throat,

15:41.800 --> 15:45.300
Tell him he owes me an
evening at le cirque. dad!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.700
Dad!

16:25.700 --> 16:29.700
I have been waiting
a long time for this, castle.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
What can i say, rick?

16:33.300 --> 16:35.000
You really had it coming.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.100
Yes, i did.
thanks for not killing me.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.700
The carpet's an antique...

16:38.700 --> 16:41.400
Turkish, mid-1600s.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.400
A blood stain on it
would've been a disaster.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.200
Besides, i was ready
to retire.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.600
Being a ghost
is a young man's game.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.600
Good to see you again,
old friend.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.400
And you, as well,
dear boy.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.700
Tell me,
how is martha?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.600
Still a one-woman show
in search of an audience.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.200
She says you owe her
an evening at le cirque.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.900
And to what
do i owe the pleasure?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.200
You're not planning
a sequel, i hope.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.300
What's this?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.300
Stolen jewelry

17:13.300 --> 17:15.300
From that rash
of home invasions.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.500
So very lovely.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.800
I was wondering if anyone's
tried to fence them.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.900
I've heard nary a whisper
of anything in this range.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.300
The police are holding a guy
named mitchell.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.400
Haven't had the pleasure.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.500
Anything special
about these?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.100
Anything they have
in common?

17:35.100 --> 17:37.500
These are hardly
everyday wear.

17:37.500 --> 17:42.600
I suppose one dusts them off
for that very special occasion.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.100
So then how did our thieves
know they were there?

17:45.100 --> 17:47.800
Seeing comes
before wanting, rick.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.300
These chaps...

17:50.900 --> 17:53.600
May actually live
among their victims

17:53.600 --> 17:56.000
And move
through their world.

17:56.300 --> 17:58.100
Anything else special
about them?

17:58.500 --> 18:00.800
Without seeing
the scene of the crime,

18:00.800 --> 18:05.000
Anything more would be
mere speculation.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.600
Well, the crime scene's
all locked and sealed.

18:07.600 --> 18:13.000
<i>i don't think i could get you in there.
let that be the least of our concerns.</i>

18:19.300 --> 18:22.300
You, uh, don't seem
out of practice.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.400
Just like riding a bike.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.200
Our thieves used
a bump key.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.300
This new generation...
how utterly vulgar.

18:29.700 --> 18:30.800
Rick...

18:30.800 --> 18:34.000
You didn't tell me
they put her in the safe.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.800
What's the significance?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.400
The significance...

18:37.400 --> 18:40.200
Is it's unnecessary.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.600
It's brutality
for brutality's sake.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.500
This used to be
a gentlemen's game.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.700
We were like ghosts.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.900
We could walk through walls
and simply disappear.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.300
But whoever did this...

18:56.800 --> 18:59.300
They're more like vampires.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.900
Just the blood
makes them feel alive.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.300
These aren't the sort of chaps
a fellow in my line of work

19:06.300 --> 19:09.200
Would care to meet by chance
in the dark.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.700
How often
does that happen?

19:10.700 --> 19:12.700
More often than you'd think,
actually.

19:12.700 --> 19:16.100
Ours is a very small
community. and then what?

19:16.100 --> 19:19.800
In my day, we'd usually come
to some sort of an agreement.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.500
You see, there was a code of
conduct among professionals.

19:34.300 --> 19:36.000
Powell.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.200
Castle?

19:44.500 --> 19:45.800
Hey.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.500
What's going on?

19:47.500 --> 19:50.000
You brought a thief
to a crime scene.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.500
It was very helpful.
it was criminal trespassing.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.500
To-may-toh, to-mah-toh. tell your
friend to keep up his disappearing act.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.300
And the next time you show up
at a crime scene without me,

19:57.300 --> 20:00.700
I'll show you how my
taser works. promise? ah.

20:01.300 --> 20:05.100
So why were you there? seeing
if there's anything i missed.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
So?

20:07.800 --> 20:08.900
So?

20:08.900 --> 20:10.100
Was there?

20:10.100 --> 20:13.400
Did mitchell make bail yet?
paperwork's not done yet.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.800
I'm holding him
out of spite.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.800
I want to talk to him. why? we
already know he wasn't involved.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.300
Something powell said.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.100
I think mitchell knows more
than he's saying.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.300
And what makes you think
he'll share it with us?

20:25.300 --> 20:28.300
Not us. just me.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.500
So what are you,

20:30.500 --> 20:33.100
A forensic psychiatrist,
some kind of profiler?

20:33.100 --> 20:37.300
Actually, uh, i'm a writer.
an embedded reporter, huh?

20:37.300 --> 20:38.900
What, are you gonna
make me famous?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.400
Not that kind of writer.
i'm a novelist.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.400
Yeah? uh, anything that, uh,
i might've heard of?

20:45.600 --> 20:50.000
Uh... "storm's last stand."

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
"storm season."
derrick storm?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.700
Yeah. i love that guy. why
the hell did you kill him?

20:55.700 --> 20:57.600
It's a long story,
but i'm working on a new one.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.700
And i gotta tell you,
it is very cool.

20:59.700 --> 21:04.000
But i want to get the details right.
they never get the details right,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.800
Not in books, movies.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.600
They always write us
as clowns and thugs.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.900
They never stop to think
that maybe we got mortgages,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.100
Families...
exactly.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.700
Okay, so...
in the new book,

21:15.100 --> 21:17.000
It's about this crew
of home invaders,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.800
Based on the crew
we're looking for right now.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.300
I got this one scene
where a guy just like you

21:21.500 --> 21:23.600
Runs into these guys
by accident

21:23.600 --> 21:29.500
In the middle of a job. wouldn't happen
to me. i'm not doing residentials.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.800
Not at least
until you catch these guys.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.700
These guys are dark.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.100
What, you know 'em?

21:39.300 --> 21:41.800
Their shot caller came into
the bar a few months back,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.100
Looking to put together
a crew.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.500
Wanted to bring me on,
said he had eyes inside

21:46.500 --> 21:47.900
Working up scores for him,

21:47.900 --> 21:49.500
Feeding him
the glengarry leads-

21:49.500 --> 21:51.500
Items, names, addresses.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.500
Said that all he needed
was one of my bump keys.

21:55.500 --> 21:56.600
Did you give it to him?

21:56.800 --> 21:59.600
<i>yeah, i gave it to him,
but just to get rid of him.</i>

21:59.600 --> 22:01.800
<i>i wasn't about to join
his crew. i'll be damned.</i>

22:01.800 --> 22:05.600
<i>why not? like i said,
these guys were dark.</i>

22:05.600 --> 22:07.300
And i'm a 2-minute man,
in and out.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.700
That's my one hard-and-fast.
but this sadistic whack job?

22:10.700 --> 22:15.100
Whoa. he said he liked to play
with his food before he ate it.

22:17.100 --> 22:20.100
All right, this, um,
this shot caller...

22:20.100 --> 22:24.000
If i put him in the book,
i want it to feel authentic.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.900
How would you describe him?

22:34.400 --> 22:36.000
This is the man
who killed her?

22:36.000 --> 22:37.500
We think so.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.700
We believe he may have had
more than just

22:39.700 --> 22:41.200
A passing relationship
with your mom.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.200
And he could be anyone-
a waiter, dog walker,

22:44.500 --> 22:48.300
Doorman, personal trainer...
no, i don't recognize him.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.100
Maybe one of
the other victims knows?

22:53.500 --> 22:55.800
Your mom
wear jewelry often?

22:56.000 --> 22:58.200
No, just to
special events.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.300
What kind
of special events?

22:59.300 --> 23:01.600
Uh, a fashion show
last year...

23:02.600 --> 23:05.000
Gallery openings,
fund-raisers...

23:05.000 --> 23:07.300
My mother
loved her causes.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.200
You know, opera companies,

23:09.200 --> 23:11.000
Environmental groups...

23:11.900 --> 23:13.300
Eyes inside.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.700
Why are we doing this again?
well, according to mitchell,

23:15.700 --> 23:17.500
The shot caller
who wanted the bump key

23:17.500 --> 23:20.100
Had someone feeding him
inside information

23:20.100 --> 23:23.800
About our victims. and powell says
the pieces of jewelry being stolen

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
Are the kind you save
for special occasions.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.800
Special occasion,
like a charity event.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.100
So we find
an organization

23:29.100 --> 23:31.000
That all of our victims
supported.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.700
And we find our guy.

23:34.700 --> 23:38.200
Delgado and pastori both gave
to the manhattan opera society.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.400
But not
the last two victims.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.500
I got three families that
donated to a.i.d.s. america-

23:42.500 --> 23:44.900
Delgado, bruner and kesler.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.900
But not pastori.

23:47.900 --> 23:51.500
Maybe pastori was a guest of
one of the other three victims.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.400
No, none of
the families knew each other.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.800
Wait a second.
m.a.d.t.-

23:55.800 --> 23:59.100
That's the metropolitan american dance
theater. metropolitan american dance theater.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.300
Metro american dance...
m.a.d.t.

24:01.300 --> 24:03.900
That's the non-profit our
invaders are profiting from.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.800
Find out who was in charge
and how i can find them.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.300
Right on.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.700
There she is-anne greene,
the company's director.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.700
She can invade my home
anytime.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.300
Yeah, well,
if she's in on it,

24:19.300 --> 24:20.600
She's doing it
purely for kicks.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.200
Textile heiress, no record
and clean dmv.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.900
White centerpieces
go on the angel tables.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.100
Red centerpieces
go on sponsor tables.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.900
Ms. greene,
i'm detective beckett,

24:29.900 --> 24:33.100
And this is-
ricky? ricky castle?

24:34.200 --> 24:36.300
I've heard perfectly
awful things about you

24:36.300 --> 24:38.500
From my friend cheney.
cheney?

24:38.500 --> 24:41.100
Tall, brunette,
aftermarket nose.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.300
Cheney... of course.
how is cheney?

24:43.300 --> 24:46.200
Oh, i hear she's a great
scandal in st. moritz.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.100
Oh.
and you?

24:47.100 --> 24:49.200
Currently between
scandals, actually.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.300
Oh, you two aren't...

24:51.300 --> 24:52.800
Not yet.
no.

24:52.900 --> 24:57.100
<i>never. in fact, um,
ricky here is assisting me</i>

24:57.100 --> 24:59.000
With a homicide investigation.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.100
How exciting. yes, and it
involves your organization.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.700
All of our employees go through
an extensive background check.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.600
I can assure you
none of them are involved.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.600
I'm still gonna need a list
of the employees

25:10.600 --> 25:14.200
Who had access to donor
records. of course.

25:17.300 --> 25:20.000
Detective, i'm sure
this is all a coincidence.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.700
Unfortunately, i'm not,
and that's why

25:21.700 --> 25:26.300
I'm gonna need a copy of your
donor list. that may be a problem.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.300
The people who give publicly-
they're not an issue.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.000
But some of our donors
cherish their anonymity.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.500
We're contractually obligated
to protect that.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.200
What about their lives?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.300
Do your donors
cherish those, as well?

25:38.300 --> 25:41.000
I assure you, my office
will contact each of them

25:41.000 --> 25:42.500
And alert them
to the situation.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.200
I'd really like
to contact them myself.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.400
I'm sorry, detective,
but my hands are tied.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.500
If you want
my confidential donor list,

25:51.500 --> 25:54.000
You're gonna need
a court order.

25:55.700 --> 25:57.700
Awkward.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.200
We ran employees
and volunteers.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.200
None have priors or records.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.500
Hello?
shh, shh!

26:07.500 --> 26:09.900
What's she doing? writing an
affidavit for a court order.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.500
That no one is going to sign.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.000
Did you see that list
of board members?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.900
Half the judges in town are on it. what am
i supposed to do, just let someone else die?

26:16.900 --> 26:19.100
Whoa, hey. you seem
a little stressed.

26:19.100 --> 26:22.900
Hey, you know what you need?
a night out on the town.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.000
A what now?

26:26.100 --> 26:26.900
What are those?

26:26.900 --> 26:29.500
The gateway
to another world.

26:29.800 --> 26:30.700
Castle.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.900
They hold
four fund-raisers a year.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.900
The last one took place a week
before the robberies began. no.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.800
It is perfect. you don't have
to ask who the donors are,

26:39.800 --> 26:42.800
Because they'll all be there,
wearing their jewelry.

26:42.800 --> 26:46.800
If the employees and volunteers
are clean, then our perp... skell.

26:46.800 --> 26:50.100
<i>could be working the party.
and we can work the door.</i>

26:50.100 --> 26:52.500
So it's settled.
pick me up at 8:00?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.600
Oh, it's, uh,
a black-tie event.

26:55.600 --> 26:58.800
That's not a problem, is it? uh, no.

26:58.800 --> 26:59.800
No.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.500
No, no, unh-unh. that one
goes to the thrift store.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.600
Whoa! "karma chameleon."

27:09.600 --> 27:14.200
The girl at saks said fluorescent is
in. well, then she was on commission.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.000
Too "showgirls"?

27:20.100 --> 27:21.400
You know
what he's trying to do?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.000
He wants to humiliate me.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.200
Lanie, can you
get that, please?

27:26.200 --> 27:29.000
All right, but you better not
be wearing your prom dress

27:29.000 --> 27:30.400
When i get back.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.700
My dad,
nervous for a date?

27:35.700 --> 27:38.700
It's not a date. it's an
undercover operation. uh-huh.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.500
Would you?
yeah.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.100
I don't know why you won't
tell me where the party is.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.400
Because you'll show up.

27:46.700 --> 27:47.300
Who was it?

27:47.300 --> 27:48.600
Delivery.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.800
From who?
let's find out.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.400
"bippity boppity boo"?

27:55.000 --> 27:57.600
"cinderella."
it's from him.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.800
Oh, please, it's a dress.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.200
Now open it up,
girlfriend.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.100
Oh, i knew
he was arrogant,

28:03.100 --> 28:06.500
But this-
this is complete-

28:07.300 --> 28:08.700
Oh.

28:11.900 --> 28:12.800
Stunning.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.100
Simply stunning.
come in, come in.

28:16.100 --> 28:19.100
Oh, hang on. hang on...

28:19.100 --> 28:20.600
You look incredible.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.500
Really?

28:21.500 --> 28:26.300
Really. you clean up nice,
detective beckett. thank you, castle.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.100
I was nominated

28:28.100 --> 28:31.000
For a, uh, tony once...

28:31.000 --> 28:32.500
Oh, no, martha, i couldn't.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.500
Yes, you can. let me-
oh, it's brilliant.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.600
So where are you guys
headed tonight?

28:37.600 --> 28:42.200
Uh, uh, uh, we're going
to the, uh, waldorf.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.300
Man, these guys are guilty
of tax evasion,

28:56.300 --> 28:58.700
Not home invasion.
yeah, well...

28:59.200 --> 29:02.200
Appearances
can be deceiving.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.200
Nice dress. yeah, what there is of it.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.600
I'd let you borrow it,
esposito,

29:11.600 --> 29:13.500
But you stretched out
the last one.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.300
Big cheese!

29:20.300 --> 29:22.300
Ricky! ricky!

29:22.300 --> 29:24.100
Hey, hey, hey!

29:24.100 --> 29:26.200
Why didn't you tell me you were
gonna be at this shindig?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.900
I would've given you a ride. oh,
last-minute thing. listen, mr. mayor,

29:28.900 --> 29:31.200
I'd like to present to you
detective kate beckett.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.100
Kate beckett, you know the mayor.
so this is detective beckett.

29:35.100 --> 29:38.700
It's an honor to meet you,
sir. oh, please, call me bob.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.700
Rick, she's even
prettier than you said.

29:43.300 --> 29:45.100
Excuse me a minute.
of course.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.500
You talk about me
to "bob"?

29:47.500 --> 29:48.600
Well,
we play cards together.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.600
Well, that, and you are the
subject of my next book. huh.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.000
Can i get you a drink?
yeah. vodka.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.800
Lots of vodka. but...

29:58.800 --> 30:01.600
I'm on duty, so... water? yeah.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.400
Vodka.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.700
Could i get two very stiff
vodka martinis?

30:07.700 --> 30:11.500
Don't shake 'em. just swirl
'em around a bit. richard. hi...

30:11.500 --> 30:15.800
Rachel maddox. we spoke on the phone. oh, and
thank you very much for getting me the tickets.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.700
Thanks for the signed
first edition for the auction.

30:17.700 --> 30:23.000
I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for
my blood. my boyfriend paul reynolds. he's a huge fan.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.300
Oh, always nice to meet a fan. hi.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.700
Don't sweat it.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.100
That's just rachel,
anne's head of development.

30:29.100 --> 30:31.900
She's only after his money,
so to speak.

30:31.900 --> 30:34.300
Oh, i'm ruthie.
um, beck-

30:34.500 --> 30:36.800
I'm s-i'm kate.
nice to meet you.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.600
Do you work
for the charity?

30:38.800 --> 30:41.800
No. no, but i am
on the circuit.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.500
You know, breast cancer,
land mines.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.800
Oh, you know
what the best one is?

30:44.800 --> 30:47.000
Um, uh, project...
what do you call it?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.400
The one with the lips.
there are a lot of, uh,

30:49.400 --> 30:52.900
Plastic surgeons there
- fish in a barrel. really?

30:53.300 --> 30:55.200
Oh, not that you
need any help from me.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.400
I see you've got
a big one on the line.

30:57.400 --> 31:01.500
Settle in, katie. i hear he's
a fighter. uh-sorry, castle?

31:01.500 --> 31:03.100
Oh, most of the girls
on the register

31:03.100 --> 31:04.800
Have tried to land him.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.700
Rich and handsome-
we call him "the white whale."

31:13.000 --> 31:13.800
Listen, we're having

31:13.800 --> 31:16.500
A little gathering next month
for our top donors.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.600
We're going to unveil plans
for a new rehearsal space.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.200
If you're free, we'd love for you and
alexis to come. you know my daughter?

31:22.200 --> 31:24.000
We make a point to know
as much as we can

31:24.000 --> 31:26.700
About our potential donors
so we can match their interests

31:26.700 --> 31:27.700
With our programs.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.000
So many places just ask you
to write a check.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.200
<i>we want you to know that your
money is making a difference.</i>

31:33.400 --> 31:36.000
Would you excuse me
just for a second? sure.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.000
So creepy.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.300
Negative on anyone
matching our sketch.

31:40.300 --> 31:44.200
How are we doing on vendors
and staff? no red flags yet.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.400
Hey, so what's it like
in there?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.300
Is it buffet
or passed hors d'oeuvres?

31:47.300 --> 31:49.900
Both. hey,
have you seen, uh-

31:51.100 --> 31:53.100
Castle,
what are you doing?

31:53.100 --> 31:54.400
Sorry,
this is the only place

31:54.400 --> 31:57.700
I knew we could talk and
not be overheard. sure it is.

31:58.000 --> 31:58.600
I was just talking

31:58.600 --> 32:01.700
To the head of, uh,
donor development over there...

32:04.800 --> 32:07.300
She seems to know
an awful lot about me.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.800
She's not the only one.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.500
Did you know that they
call you "the white whale"?

32:11.500 --> 32:12.800
The white whale?
mm-hmm.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.300
Not moby-
no.

32:15.900 --> 32:18.400
She's in donor development.
it's her job to know about you.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.000
Besides,
she doesn't strike me

32:20.000 --> 32:23.900
As a criminal mastermind. still, i
think we should take a second look.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.900
Two, three... dip.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.500
Castle, a little help.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.100
It's powell.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.800
The jewel thief?

32:40.600 --> 32:43.700
I don't believe this.
the two of you are in on it?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.900
Don't look at me.
it was his idea.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.500
You really had me going,
didn't you?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.600
The wine, the cheese,
the code of conduct-

32:50.600 --> 32:54.900
And here you are, making me look the
fool. i just wanted to have a bit of fun.

32:54.900 --> 32:58.400
Fun? you call what you're doing
"fun"? castle, what's going on?

32:58.400 --> 33:01.200
They're in on it together.
they've all but admitted it.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.500
I am so sorry. i had no idea
it was such a big deal.

33:04.500 --> 33:07.200

33:07.500 --> 33:10.300

Good lord, rick.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.200

33:14.200 --> 33:17.500

It's perfect.
he i.d.'s the jewels

34:57.300 --> 34:58.600
And then uses

To build profiles on
the victims. yo! yahtzee.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.200
Paul reynolds,
a.k.a. chad nellis.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.800
He served on check fraud,
embezzlement,

35:05.800 --> 35:07.800
Forgery and grand larceny.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.400
Well, it does no good
to be coy.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.600
I've seen the looks you've been
throwing me all night. shopping, are we?

35:13.600 --> 35:15.300
Paul reynolds,
you're under arrest

35:15.300 --> 35:19.200
On suspicion of theft and conspiracy
to commit murder. let's go.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.800
Where was the badge?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.100
Don't ask.

35:24.900 --> 35:28.100
Yo. b&e, firearms-

35:28.100 --> 35:30.000
Definitely
a step up for this guy.

35:30.400 --> 35:31.700
He's just
a foot soldier.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.200
We're looking for his general.
what happened to the dress?

35:34.600 --> 35:38.200
You didn't think i was gonna interrogate
him in it, did you? we were kinda hoping...

35:41.100 --> 35:42.200
Outta my chair, castle.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.400
Yes.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.000
So you know him?

35:45.000 --> 35:48.600
We met in green haven prison.
a guy like me-

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
You know they've would've
eaten me alive in there.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.900
But he looked out for me
in the yard.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.300
They-they were all afraid
of him, even the guards.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.400
And when he got out,
he found me. i don't know how.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.700
So it was his idea
to infiltrate the charity.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.700
I was already seeing rachel
at the time.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.000
I mean, i was trying
to go straight,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.100
But he said that i owed him. and so
you just fed him all the top donors.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.300
Everything he needed was
already in the dossiers-

36:09.300 --> 36:11.100
Names, addresses.

36:11.100 --> 36:13.100
I took photographs
of all their jewelry,

36:13.100 --> 36:17.500
Put it all on a flash drive,
but he wanted more and more.

36:17.700 --> 36:21.400
Detective, after he beat
that guy to death,

36:21.400 --> 36:23.200
I told him i wanted out.

36:23.200 --> 36:25.200
But he said that if i quit,

36:25.200 --> 36:28.400
That he'd do everything
he saved me from in prison.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.900
<i>he'd do it to me
and rachel.</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Then tell me
where i can find him.

36:46.700 --> 36:48.200
Castle, as a friend,

36:48.200 --> 36:50.700
I am asking you
not to leave this car,

36:50.700 --> 36:53.400
'cause your little hardy boy act...
is gonna get me killed, i know.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.700
More like
get one of them killed,

36:54.700 --> 36:57.600
And i can't have that on
my conscience. understood?

36:57.600 --> 36:59.400
What if i have to pee?

37:04.500 --> 37:06.200
Go, go, go.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.000
Nypd! we have a warrant!

37:31.500 --> 37:33.300
Look, his coffee.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.900
Still warm.
must've just missed him.

37:35.900 --> 37:36.800
And roger.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.300
Can i have your, uh,
next position after 1-7-0-8?

37:45.200 --> 37:47.200
This is detective castle
to all units.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.200
That's a negatory
on the backup.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.500
This dirtbag's all mine.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.400
Looks like
we got the right place.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.100
Police! police!

38:11.100 --> 38:12.800
Stop, police!

38:17.700 --> 38:19.400
Follow him out back!

38:28.200 --> 38:29.400
God.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.000
Out of the car!

38:39.000 --> 38:41.600
I- she told me i actually
have to stay in here-

38:41.600 --> 38:44.800
Out of the car now! okay, okay,
okay, here i come. i'm coming.

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
God.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.800
Go ahead...

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400
I need the practice.

39:02.300 --> 39:03.200
We got him.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.300
Get up.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I tried to stay in the car.
i really did.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.200
He hit me in the face,
you know. yeah, i saw that.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.800
That, uh, "go ahead,
i need the practice"-

39:15.800 --> 39:17.000
That was classic.

39:22.300 --> 39:23.100
Castle!

39:23.100 --> 39:24.000
Sorry.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.200
The other pieces
are still in evidence,

39:30.200 --> 39:35.500
But i don't see the harm
in returning this.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.900
How do you get over it?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.200
You don't.

39:46.900 --> 39:48.600
But one day you'll wake up
and you'll find

39:48.600 --> 39:51.600
That you don't mind
carrying it around with you.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.900
At least that's as far
as i've come.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.900
Thank you, detective.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.600
My name's kate.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.600

to talk...

40:22.200 --> 40:24.800

Oh, no, i just came to return your
mom's jewelry. you saved my life.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.500
The least i can do is make you some eggs. no, really, i

40:35.500 --> 40:37.600
Nonsense!

40:37.600 --> 40:42.000
