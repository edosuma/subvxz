02:09.026 --> 02:10.777
John! John, straight!

02:10.902 --> 02:11.904
Move it along.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.574
John. John, straight.

02:16.909 --> 02:17.910
Move it.

04:13.525 --> 04:14.526
Let's go now!

04:14.651 --> 04:16.028
Let's go!

04:16.153 --> 04:18.404
Time and tide wait for no man.

04:28.457 --> 04:29.458
Ready for work.

04:29.583 --> 04:30.834
Sick list.

04:31.585 --> 04:32.795
Keep loading 'em.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.297
Fong good. No sick.

04:36.423 --> 04:38.300
- All better.
- Sick list.

04:38.675 --> 04:41.428
Keep it moving.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.431
- Boss man.
- Let's go, Tao. Get on that train.

04:52.272 --> 04:54.274
Mr. Bohannon.

04:54.817 --> 04:57.486
I'm obliged for the hard service
you have laid down for me.

04:58.028 --> 04:59.321
It is what I expect,

04:59.446 --> 05:03.951
what is ordained from on high
that you should put suffering in my path.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.412
Best get to shoveling then.

05:07.538 --> 05:10.249
I was right to put you down
in that well,

05:10.958 --> 05:15.128
just as now it is right that you set
me to shoveling snow, far away,

05:16.046 --> 05:20.133
in the wilderness,
where my brethren freeze and starve.

05:20.259 --> 05:21.844
We pay you enough to keep 'em fed.

05:21.969 --> 05:24.054
It is what I have said,

05:24.721 --> 05:29.226
that to be tested by you
is the making of my soul.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.563
You are God's instrument.

05:35.065 --> 05:37.150
I come to remind you, is all.

05:37.276 --> 05:38.402
You remember,

05:40.279 --> 05:42.239
got you in my line of sight.

06:00.632 --> 06:01.967
- Mr. Chang.
- Mr. Gundersen.

06:02.092 --> 06:03.176
Yeah. Please, sir?

06:03.302 --> 06:04.946
I hope nothing is wrong with your order.

06:04.970 --> 06:05.970
No, no.

06:06.013 --> 06:10.601
One box of rice, as requested.

06:11.894 --> 06:13.854
Our agreed-upon sum.

06:15.022 --> 06:16.565
- Sir, very good.
- Very good indeed.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.317
In fact,

06:18.442 --> 06:20.527
I would like to treble the order.

06:20.903 --> 06:22.237
Three times the order?

06:22.738 --> 06:25.032
Three crates instead of one?
Yes.

06:26.491 --> 06:27.659
In that case...

06:27.784 --> 06:29.453
ls there a problem?

06:29.578 --> 06:30.704
No, no. No.

06:32.331 --> 06:35.334
But you have purchased so much
from me by now.

06:35.792 --> 06:40.297
Allow me to ask,
what is the purpose for so much rice?

06:40.714 --> 06:45.385
Well, I do not see
where that is your concern, Mr. Chang.

06:45.510 --> 06:49.848
Only that, if someone were to become
aware of the business we do together,

06:49.973 --> 06:51.475
if there was any trouble...

06:51.600 --> 06:54.561
That will not happen.

06:56.396 --> 07:01.068
But if you wish, I'm sure I can acquire
another source of supply in the future.

07:03.111 --> 07:06.990
I will do so.
Good day, Mr. Chang.

07:07.950 --> 07:10.494
It's not necessary, Mr. Gundersen.

07:10.619 --> 07:13.789
Perhaps it was just my curiosity.

07:13.914 --> 07:16.208
Three crates, the 10th of next month.

07:16.333 --> 07:22.965
Although I must ask for another $20
per crate, due to costs and risks.

07:24.841 --> 07:25.926
10.

07:31.181 --> 07:32.307
10.

07:43.652 --> 07:46.655
- All is ready.
- All right. Matches.

07:48.782 --> 07:49.825
Tao.

07:55.288 --> 07:56.623
Say your piece.

07:57.624 --> 07:59.126
You forbid Mei to work.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.294
No women on the railroad,
plain and simple.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.755
The men will ask questions.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.467
I'll keep a tight lip, but that's as far
as I go with this. Light the damn fuse.

08:07.592 --> 08:11.054
She does good work.
She works like a man.

08:11.179 --> 08:12.179
Nope.

08:12.264 --> 08:14.850
- She better than two men...
- No, I said.

08:16.435 --> 08:20.188
If Mei does not work,
the men wonder why.

08:20.731 --> 08:22.315
Not safe for her.

08:23.483 --> 08:27.279
You let her work
or I take her away from here.

08:29.614 --> 08:30.907
And go where?

08:31.575 --> 08:35.662
We left everything behind already.

08:37.246 --> 08:38.832
Much more than this.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.833
Bohannon! What's the hold-up?

08:40.958 --> 08:42.711
Calm the hell down.

08:45.297 --> 08:46.882
Shit.

08:48.425 --> 08:50.260
I need you on the railroad.

08:51.053 --> 08:54.264
One week sick list, no more.

08:55.682 --> 08:57.142
Or we both go.

09:19.414 --> 09:20.415
Take us up.

09:55.617 --> 09:58.495
Spectacular! Three inches before lunch.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.020
That is what I call an improvement.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.583
We'll be makin' four foot a week.
If it holds up.

10:03.708 --> 10:07.879
Mr. Bohannon, you are like Hercules,
triumphant after his seven labors.

10:08.004 --> 10:11.800
I believe in this Colossus of yours.
If you blow any more smoke up his ass,

10:11.925 --> 10:14.344
you're liable to start a fire,
Mr. Huntington.

10:14.469 --> 10:17.013
The Minotaur speaks.
The sour, disputatious

10:17.139 --> 10:21.476
back-looking voice of a beast
locked away in a labyrinth of the past.

10:22.144 --> 10:24.938
The word is progress,
Mr. Strobridge.

10:25.063 --> 10:28.400
That steam engine machine
is also gonna save me $5 a day.

10:28.525 --> 10:29.526
Times three.

10:29.651 --> 10:32.696
The men that turned that wheel,
Colossus, put 'em out of work.

10:32.821 --> 10:34.281
Plenty work to go around.

10:34.406 --> 10:36.199
Reassign them to the tunnel.

10:36.324 --> 10:37.868
Making me money with one hand

10:37.993 --> 10:40.078
and taking it back with the other
doesn't win a race.

10:40.495 --> 10:43.373
Neither does a short-handed crew.
Mr. Strobridge.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.710
Jake's work, Jake's wages.

10:46.835 --> 10:49.379
That's a dollar a day.
These men are seeing five now.

10:49.504 --> 10:52.883
Either that or fire them.
I'm getting cold, gentlemen.

10:56.428 --> 10:59.764
- He ain't wrong on the numbers.
- If you think like a boss.

11:02.517 --> 11:04.936
That's the difference, then, ain't it?

11:06.104 --> 11:07.314
All right.

11:10.859 --> 11:11.985
Wait.

11:13.987 --> 11:15.488
They're my guys-

11:20.535 --> 11:21.870
<i>What I done, boys,</i>

11:21.995 --> 11:25.665
is set you up nicer than an
umbrella salesman in a hurricane.

11:25.790 --> 11:28.335
You and your crew stay out of the sun.

11:28.460 --> 11:32.047
You don't lift a finger but to point
John Chinaman toward a pile of rock.

11:32.172 --> 11:34.174
I'm paying you to babysit,
is what I'm doing.

11:34.299 --> 11:37.052
- Paying us a dollar a day?
- That's what the hole pays.

11:37.177 --> 11:40.847
- What it pays John Chinaman.
- We got families to feed, Stro.

11:40.972 --> 11:43.225
How can we do that on a dollar a day?

11:43.642 --> 11:48.230
I promise you, I will get you
out of that hole as soon as I can.

11:48.355 --> 11:49.940
One tin goddamn dollar?

11:50.065 --> 11:53.193
- Is better than eating leather, ain't it?
- But it ain't enough to live on.

11:53.568 --> 11:55.111
Not to live like a white man, anyway.

11:55.237 --> 11:57.781
We gave you sweat and blood,
and you cut us to nothin'

11:57.906 --> 11:59.950
and send us back down
that shithole of a tunnel.

12:00.075 --> 12:03.245
I worked that tunnel myself.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.955
Says the stakeholder.

12:05.580 --> 12:07.958
Well, pay us in stock,
we'll go down whatever hole you want.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.877
You don't want to work,
pack your gear.

12:12.128 --> 12:13.608
- You got it wrong...
- That's enough.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.882
You told these men what we got for 'em.

12:16.424 --> 12:20.095
They don't want it,
train leaves in the morning for Sacramento.

12:33.275 --> 12:34.651
You wanted to see me?

12:34.776 --> 12:36.820
Yeah.

12:37.570 --> 12:39.730
- Is something wrong?
- I believe not. It is only that,

12:39.823 --> 12:45.578
there are some figures here
I cannot seem to reconcile.

12:46.121 --> 12:48.373
- You are the accountant.
- And yet there is something,

12:48.498 --> 12:50.667
perhaps I'm not
looking at it correctly,

12:50.792 --> 12:53.837
or there's an error I've made.
If you would just have a look?

12:55.380 --> 12:57.382
You see these entries,
under receivables?

12:57.507 --> 12:58.842
- These here?
- Yeah, precisely.

12:58.967 --> 13:02.512
Now, if you set aside the interest
and carry these figures over...

13:02.637 --> 13:05.432
- Brother Gundersen, I'm sure it's fine.
- But it is not fine!

13:06.349 --> 13:09.978
I am thinking it is a discrepancy
in how the sums

13:10.103 --> 13:12.355
were entered but if not...

13:12.480 --> 13:14.274
Well then, you see,

13:14.399 --> 13:17.861
perhaps something is wrong

13:21.031 --> 13:22.490
on the other end.

13:23.700 --> 13:27.495
There would seem to be a shortfall
going back several months.

13:30.373 --> 13:31.750
In the funds we receive?

13:31.875 --> 13:34.461
In, Salt Lake City.

13:37.964 --> 13:39.466
Are we being cheated?

13:40.508 --> 13:42.385
I can only think it is my mistake.

13:42.510 --> 13:44.846
Forgive me for even mentioning it, Brother.

13:49.893 --> 13:51.811
It is your job to mention it.

14:02.614 --> 14:06.951
I said it before, I'll say it again,
race comes down to one thing, water.

14:07.077 --> 14:09.871
We dispatch a crew to Reno today,
have them start digging wells,

14:09.996 --> 14:12.624
we'll have all the water we need
to survive the Nevada desert.

14:12.749 --> 14:13.949
Bohannon signed off on this?

14:14.042 --> 14:15.543
I need Bohannon's signature now?

14:15.668 --> 14:18.713
It... It doesn't impugn us. I thought
Bohannon's plan for water was sound.

14:18.838 --> 14:21.841
I know three good men
hauled rock for me since Sacramento,

14:21.966 --> 14:24.427
they can lead a crew.
Three good men?

14:24.552 --> 14:26.805
Them plus some Jakes, yeah.

14:27.639 --> 14:30.809
Next time you want a favor, spare me
the song and dance, Mr. Strobridge.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.185
They're capable.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.146
They are dead weight.
Expensive dead weight,

14:35.271 --> 14:40.360
at a time when I need all of my resources
focused on breaking through that tunnel.

14:40.485 --> 14:43.446
And Jim, Charlie Crocker
found you five years ago.

14:43.571 --> 14:45.782
You were digging ditches
in San Jose for pennies a day,

14:45.907 --> 14:50.286
and you make $125 a month
as construction manager

14:50.412 --> 14:52.872
for the greatest enterprise
in the history of America.

14:52.997 --> 14:56.376
All I'm saying is, $15 a day
means a whole lot more to those men

14:56.501 --> 14:58.378
than it does to this enterprise.

14:59.921 --> 15:02.632
Back in Sacramento,
during the rush of '49,

15:02.757 --> 15:06.636
everyjackanape with a dollar and a dream
wanted to turn up his fortune in gold.

15:06.761 --> 15:08.972
Now, the thing about gold is,
it's buried in the ground.

15:09.097 --> 15:11.474
If you wanna get it out,
you gotta dig it up.

15:11.599 --> 15:15.562
In order to dig it up,
you need one thing.

15:16.938 --> 15:21.484
At that time, a shovel cost $15.

15:21.609 --> 15:23.945
A plot of land, $75.

15:24.446 --> 15:28.825
I had $90 to my name, exactly $90.

15:28.950 --> 15:31.161
Just enough to buy a plot of land
and a shovel.

15:31.286 --> 15:33.204
Or enough to buy six shovels.

15:34.122 --> 15:37.333
The first six sold
by Huntington Hardware Incorporated.

15:37.459 --> 15:40.587
And Jim, you can be a man
with a shovel in your hand

15:40.712 --> 15:45.592
or you can be the man that sells the shovel
to the man with a shovel in his hand.

15:47.135 --> 15:49.512
That'll be $15, Mr. Strobridge,
if you're interested.

15:49.637 --> 15:53.892
<i>Matt Keane, Pete Jones, Dan Cakes.
They're good men.</i>

15:54.476 --> 15:57.020
They're good men with families.

15:57.395 --> 15:59.981
Good men with families
get fired every day.

16:00.982 --> 16:02.609
Don't be one of 'em.

16:05.570 --> 16:07.572
Good day, Mr. Strobridge.

16:09.407 --> 16:10.575
Yeah.

16:58.122 --> 17:00.917
"By three methods
we may learn wisdom."

17:01.626 --> 17:06.589
"First, by reflection,
second, by imitation..."

17:06.714 --> 17:08.758
"And third, by experience."

17:08.883 --> 17:10.926
"Which is the bitterest."

17:11.051 --> 17:17.183
Wisdom gained through experience is the
reason young men must respect their elders.

17:18.726 --> 17:22.605
You are right, Tao, forgive me.

17:22.730 --> 17:23.731
Lili!

17:29.070 --> 17:31.906
Lili is one of our most experienced girls.

17:32.574 --> 17:35.285
Imagine the wisdom she could provide.

17:36.077 --> 17:39.914
A free night for you, out of respect.

18:10.945 --> 18:15.491
Now I told you not to fool with that.
Give me here.

18:20.121 --> 18:22.790
Run along, go wash up for dinner, Janie.

18:27.503 --> 18:29.964
I just didn't want her
to prick her finger, is all.

18:31.799 --> 18:33.801
Listen.

18:37.096 --> 18:39.932
Whatever it is,
you'll find a way through.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.102
You always do, James.

18:51.277 --> 18:52.654
Mr. Bohannon.

18:56.157 --> 18:58.117
Aren't you going to ask your boss
to sit down?

19:01.496 --> 19:04.165
Perhaps I'll fix you two some dinner,
it's nearly time.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.584
I was gonna take Jim away from here,
get us a drink.

19:19.347 --> 19:21.683
I'm used to you running your mouth.

19:25.228 --> 19:27.397
You might not like what I gotta say.

19:29.482 --> 19:31.734
Damn it.

19:33.486 --> 19:36.197
You cut me down today with my men.

19:36.906 --> 19:38.533
Clean gelded me.

19:40.076 --> 19:42.787
Implies you had a pair to begin with.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.207
I had it under control.

19:46.791 --> 19:50.294
- Hell you did.
- It was moving in the right direction.

19:52.255 --> 19:53.673
Hell it was.

20:03.516 --> 20:07.270
Ask nice, Johnny Reb.

20:08.229 --> 20:09.772
I ain't asking.

20:26.873 --> 20:28.666
Tread light, son.

20:31.294 --> 20:32.462
You got this?

22:17.942 --> 22:20.069
They're takin' money from our pockets,

22:20.194 --> 22:23.281
food from our bellies
and roofs from over our heads.

22:24.115 --> 22:27.994
They come over here and do they even bother
to learn our language? No.

22:28.536 --> 22:32.874
Do they live like normal people should? No.

22:33.457 --> 22:37.128
They don't contribute a goddamn thing.

22:37.503 --> 22:39.088
They just take.

22:39.213 --> 22:41.757
They can afford to
work for nothing, sure,

22:41.883 --> 22:43.634
when they're willing to eat rats and worms.

22:43.759 --> 22:45.428
Listen to me now, boys.

22:45.553 --> 22:49.390
I have no love for the Chinamen,
but they work hard.

22:49.515 --> 22:52.018
We've all seen it.
You only gotta show 'em a thing but once,

22:52.143 --> 22:54.061
and they do it as good
as any white man.

22:54.186 --> 22:56.397
They keep to themselves
and they don't complain.

22:56.522 --> 22:59.275
Belly-achin' ain't gonna send
the yellow man back to China.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.070
Them slant eyes need to be taught
a lesson's what they need.

23:04.238 --> 23:05.865
That's enough.

23:09.535 --> 23:12.455
I gave you a chance.
I said I'd look out for you.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.790
It's more than I gave
any one of them Jakes.

23:15.541 --> 23:18.586
Now I'm goin' home to my family.

23:19.128 --> 23:21.088
I think you should turn in, too.

23:21.213 --> 23:23.090
Think about this fresh tomorrow.

23:24.091 --> 23:26.260
We ain't working for you no more, Stro.

23:27.094 --> 23:28.679
You don't tell us what to do.

23:28.804 --> 23:31.766
No, no, no, boys. He's right.

23:32.975 --> 23:34.602
There's no good we can do.

23:37.438 --> 23:39.732
We'll finish up our drinks and then...

24:00.586 --> 24:04.173
I wanna talk about this once
and put it behind for good. All right?

24:15.643 --> 24:16.894
If I no work...

24:17.019 --> 24:19.146
You're in danger. I get it.

24:23.609 --> 24:28.030
When rebel burn our village,
Taiping war,

24:28.781 --> 24:31.158
they take all women.

24:32.785 --> 24:37.999
Rebel leader, he choose me for...
for his bride.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.837
Rebel leader,
he Sze Yup Company now.

24:44.130 --> 24:47.216
Many workers here Sze Yup Company.

24:48.134 --> 24:52.013
Chang, is he Sze Yup?

24:57.309 --> 25:00.855
Chang work for rebel leader
in San Francisco.

25:03.274 --> 25:08.571
If Sze Yup find me,
make me Daughter of Sun and Moon.

25:14.076 --> 25:16.328
I belong to them.

25:16.954 --> 25:18.706
That's Why I hide.

25:19.707 --> 25:22.543
This is America.
Ain't nobody belongs to nobody.

25:22.668 --> 25:24.211
We fought a war over it.

25:26.589 --> 25:28.424
But we still Chinese.

25:45.357 --> 25:46.358
Tomorrow morning.

25:50.112 --> 25:51.655
Eight o'clock sharp.

25:53.699 --> 25:56.327
I need all the good men I can get.

25:57.328 --> 25:58.913
Fong included.

26:08.255 --> 26:10.382
Welcome.
Can I help you gentlemen?

26:10.508 --> 26:13.302
Yeah, we want what you got,
China Jake.

26:13.427 --> 26:16.639
You like fine ladies?
You want honey girls?

26:16.764 --> 26:18.349
- Fine ladies?
- "Fine ladies..."

26:18.474 --> 26:19.892
Filthy whores, is more like it.

26:23.604 --> 26:26.816
- Is this Chang's place?
- What kind of a slut shop is this anyway?

26:30.277 --> 26:32.196
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

26:35.032 --> 26:38.160
Is there a problem?
Surely we have something to soothe you.

26:40.121 --> 26:42.998
We got a fancy one here, boys.

26:43.124 --> 26:45.751
This yellow monkey's
speakin' the king's English.

26:45.876 --> 26:48.045
Perhaps one of our pleasure-ladies?

26:48.170 --> 26:49.755
I wouldn't put my finger in 'em.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.258
A pipe of dreams, then?
There will be no charge.

26:52.383 --> 26:54.051
We don't want your charity.

26:55.636 --> 26:58.264
Then there is no way we can help you.
Sorry to say.

26:58.889 --> 27:03.185
Go ahead then. Throw us out.
See how that goes for you, Jake.

27:04.228 --> 27:05.896
My name is Chang.

27:27.418 --> 27:29.086
Now march, Jake.

27:35.426 --> 27:37.803
Chop, chop.
You think you're better than us?

27:37.928 --> 27:40.431
Yeah, he does, you know.
We'll show him who's better.

27:40.556 --> 27:41.557
Move!

27:58.949 --> 28:02.077
Where's them fancy English
words now, Chinaman?

28:11.962 --> 28:12.963
Get them ropes.

28:16.592 --> 28:17.593
Do it!

28:22.306 --> 28:23.599
<i>That'll do.</i>

28:31.315 --> 28:32.608
What's that you're sayin'?

28:32.733 --> 28:36.695
I said it would be best for you
to kill me. Now that you've begun.

28:51.585 --> 28:54.380
Pray you do not live long enough
to change places with him.

28:58.592 --> 29:02.221
Get back to your tents!
Go on, get back!

29:10.604 --> 29:11.772
Pull him up!

29:24.243 --> 29:25.786
Come on, let's go. Move.

29:41.135 --> 29:42.428
Trouble! Chang!

31:07.805 --> 31:10.933
I was right, then.

31:11.058 --> 31:14.436
You have found some grievous error of mine.

31:14.561 --> 31:16.605
I found an error, all right.

31:19.191 --> 31:20.943
But it wasn't yours.

31:23.695 --> 31:25.406
Salt Lake City?

31:27.408 --> 31:28.409
My father.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.079
No. No, it can't be.

31:32.204 --> 31:36.750
My father, The Lion of the Lord,
Brother Brigham...

31:36.875 --> 31:40.754
the Prophet, the
deliverer of his people,

31:40.879 --> 31:44.800
a liar, a thief, a cheat.

31:44.925 --> 31:49.555
- Boy, you must not utter such blasphemy.
- He has cheated me

31:50.514 --> 31:51.932
since the moment that we got here!

31:52.057 --> 31:54.935
Is that not what those books of yours say?
I...

31:55.269 --> 31:56.812
Is it or isn't it?

31:58.397 --> 31:59.440
Yes.

31:59.898 --> 32:05.571
But I'm sure there is
a viable explanation.

32:05.696 --> 32:07.197
Damn you, man.

32:25.048 --> 32:26.592
I want justice.

32:33.807 --> 32:36.226
It's not easy to know what that means.

32:38.395 --> 32:41.482
And frankly, Mr. Chang, I...
I'm not sure what's possible.

32:42.316 --> 32:43.817
What's possible?

33:07.341 --> 33:11.261
A 20-year-old Chinaman gets on a boat
in Guangdong, China.

33:11.845 --> 33:15.682
He sets sail with a Sze Yup Company flyer
and a ticket for passage.

33:16.099 --> 33:18.769
He arrives in San Francisco,
where a team of men herd him

33:18.894 --> 33:23.190
and a hundred others into freight cars
that transport them to Cisco.

33:23.607 --> 33:28.070
In Cisco, another team
loads the men into wagons.

33:28.195 --> 33:31.782
Then three days later,
after traversing the Sierra Summit,

33:32.741 --> 33:35.619
they deliver those Chinamen
to the railroad.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.122
Now neither you, you

33:40.791 --> 33:45.671
or you has the capability
to reproduce that impossible feat once,

33:45.796 --> 33:49.007
let alone 15,000 times.

33:49.132 --> 33:53.303
So when I ask for justice,
I mean justice.

33:54.721 --> 33:56.723
The kind reserved for civilized men,

33:58.392 --> 34:00.477
free from the danger of a rope.

34:07.192 --> 34:11.196
Well, Mr. Chang, I'll tell you.

34:11.321 --> 34:14.366
Now, what justice means in America is,
we have a trial.

34:14.491 --> 34:15.951
You want justice, that's it.

34:16.076 --> 34:19.121
We don't go hanging people in
this country without a trial.

34:19.246 --> 34:23.917
What we are, as you have pointed out,
a civilized nation after all.

34:30.882 --> 34:32.301
A trial, then.

34:58.660 --> 35:00.704
He's no ordinary Chinaman.

35:00.829 --> 35:03.206
He's our one and only provider
of Chinese workers.

35:03.332 --> 35:06.001
And we must be perceived
to do right by him.

35:07.336 --> 35:09.880
I count on you two to keep control
of these things.

35:10.005 --> 35:12.382
I mean, need I remind you,
there's 12,000 Chinese sleeping

35:12.507 --> 35:13.884
not 100 yards from here.

35:14.009 --> 35:17.220
Well, if they see us walking a man
after they strung up one of their own?

35:17.346 --> 35:19.640
A judge and jury's
never gonna convict those men.

35:19.765 --> 35:21.016
We promised him a trial.

35:21.933 --> 35:23.685
You need to telegram Stanford.

35:24.102 --> 35:26.063
My son-of-a-bitch partner?

35:26.188 --> 35:28.315
I'd rather feed my scrotum
to a grinder monkey.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.777
He's a lawyer. He can serve as a judge.
Impanel a jury.

35:33.570 --> 35:35.864
God damn it, you're right.

35:38.700 --> 35:40.285
You come with me.

35:44.706 --> 35:46.708
- Where are we goin'?
- To arrest them men.

35:47.125 --> 35:48.519
- Arrest them?
- It's for their own good.

35:48.543 --> 35:51.338
They ain't safe walkin' around.
Whose side are you on, anyway?

36:00.263 --> 36:03.058
You get that outta your system?

36:08.021 --> 36:10.482
Same side as you.
The railroad's.

36:14.945 --> 36:16.154
Now let's go.

36:24.996 --> 36:27.457
Stand up. You're under arrest.

36:28.083 --> 36:30.377
- Arrest? For what?
- Murder. Stand up.

36:31.461 --> 36:33.338
<i>- Sire, come on.
- Stand up.</i>

36:33.839 --> 36:35.841
- They were Chinamen.
- Yeah.

36:36.591 --> 36:38.260
The wrong Chinamen.

36:47.227 --> 36:49.354
When you read this, Father,

36:50.814 --> 36:53.942
you'll say, "Phineas is whining
and complaining again."

36:54.317 --> 36:57.404
You'll say that you should have sent
one of my brothers.

36:58.363 --> 37:03.160
You've never trusted me
and now you have set me an impossible task,

37:03.744 --> 37:06.496
in wild and miserable country,

37:06.997 --> 37:10.834
and have cheated me
of the money I need to succeed.

37:11.501 --> 37:14.671
You've made sure that I'd fail, always.

37:15.505 --> 37:17.215
But this time, I have the proof.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.884
Stop, Stop-

37:19.009 --> 37:23.388
You must not do this. You must not.

37:23.764 --> 37:28.977
To address the Lord's servant in this way,
His sainted presence on earth...

37:29.102 --> 37:31.563
By whom you mean my cruel,
unjust father?

37:31.688 --> 37:32.898
Please, Brother.

37:33.023 --> 37:35.400
Who has ignored me my whole life?

37:35.525 --> 37:37.611
Who has undermined my every effort?

37:37.736 --> 37:40.947
Control yourself.

37:42.741 --> 37:44.409
For your own good.

37:44.910 --> 37:47.412
Let me have that, and go.

37:59.132 --> 38:00.550
One of my brothers.

38:02.302 --> 38:04.179
- You don't understand.
- Shh.

38:06.973 --> 38:12.687
Have you asked yourself what...
what will be the consequence of...

38:12.813 --> 38:14.314
of this letter?

38:17.317 --> 38:23.198
- I have...
- You have said what is in your heart,

38:24.324 --> 38:25.826
and what is true.

38:27.077 --> 38:31.998
But truth... truth does
not always serve us.

38:32.582 --> 38:33.750
When it is...

38:34.751 --> 38:39.005
when it is so naked and hot,

38:40.257 --> 38:42.342
it will not allow us to...

38:43.343 --> 38:45.846
to enact God's will.

38:54.271 --> 38:57.566
You must learn this.

38:59.025 --> 39:00.819
Then you must teach me, Brother.

39:03.321 --> 39:05.156
You must tell me what to do.

39:06.867 --> 39:10.370
Now that we have the evidence...

39:12.581 --> 39:13.915
But no.

39:14.291 --> 39:19.004
No, you will see for yourself,
when anger no longer clouds your eyes.

39:19.129 --> 39:20.255
No.

39:22.716 --> 39:24.342
You must show me.

39:28.471 --> 39:30.432
I have no one to trust but you.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.565
All right, my son.

39:40.442 --> 39:41.526
All right.

39:47.991 --> 39:49.784
Spoken like a native.

39:50.452 --> 39:52.537
Native of Vermont. Come on!

39:53.914 --> 39:55.248
All right.

39:56.374 --> 39:57.709
All right what?

39:58.084 --> 40:00.503
All right, the railroad comes first.

40:02.547 --> 40:04.090
It's all we got, you and me.

40:04.841 --> 40:06.384
Actually, boss,

40:08.094 --> 40:09.554
I have a wife.

40:10.138 --> 40:15.727
Five sons, a daughter, two dogs, eight
hens, a couple of cats, and a canary.

40:15.852 --> 40:17.354
I liked you better quiet.

40:28.031 --> 40:29.741
Fong ready for work.

40:34.204 --> 40:36.539
Get to it then.

40:41.586 --> 40:45.173
Mr. Bohannon, from Stanford.

40:54.099 --> 40:55.433
All right.

40:57.602 --> 40:59.020
I'll talk to him.

41:04.609 --> 41:07.862
There won't be a trial.
That'd be a waste of time.

41:09.114 --> 41:13.535
And they wouldn't be convicted,
'cause the only witnesses is you and Tao.

41:14.577 --> 41:18.707
And Chinamen ain't allowed to testify
against white men under California law.

41:23.378 --> 41:24.754
So this is America.

41:26.715 --> 41:30.677
It may be the law, Mr. Bohannon,
but it is not justice.

41:31.636 --> 41:32.887
No, it ain't.

41:35.306 --> 41:37.434
Them men will leave Truckee,

41:38.893 --> 41:40.437
and you're gonna let 'em.

41:43.606 --> 41:45.567
Do we understand each other?

41:50.071 --> 41:52.574
I think we understand
each other very well.
