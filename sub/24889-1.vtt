01:31.063 --> 01:32.146
Oh, my God.

01:37.529 --> 01:38.362
Oh, fuck!

02:49.684 --> 02:50.888
Jenna.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.254
No. Jenna.

02:52.805 --> 02:56.672
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, what happened?

02:57.746 --> 03:01.128
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, Jenna,
Jenna, no, no, no, baby,

03:01.130 --> 03:03.239
no, no, no, no, Jenna,
Jenna, Jenna, Jenna.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.343
Monica, Monica, Monica!

03:13.054 --> 03:15.043
Monica, who did this?

03:15.045 --> 03:16.511
Who did this?

03:23.627 --> 03:25.352
Monica, Monica!

04:00.426 --> 04:03.833
911,
what's your emergency?

04:03.835 --> 04:05.148
Yes, I uh...

04:06.935 --> 04:07.818
I...

04:11.085 --> 04:13.633
Yeah, I'm very sorry, I meant to dial

04:13.635 --> 04:15.352
411, not 911.

04:16.605 --> 04:17.993
Very sorry.

04:17.995 --> 04:18.827
Thank you.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.658
I wanna propose a toast.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.278
Let's drink to our friendship,
and let's not wait another

04:38.280 --> 04:40.540
freaking two years
before we meet up again.

04:52.524 --> 04:53.946
What's up, boy?

04:53.948 --> 04:54.948
Jason!

04:54.950 --> 04:56.447
Fuck, it's been a minute.

04:56.449 --> 04:59.008
Oh, I missed you so much, man, so much!

05:00.035 --> 05:00.866
Jenna.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.153
Eric.

05:02.155 --> 05:03.803
Looking beautiful as always.

05:03.805 --> 05:05.083
Oh, thank you.

05:05.085 --> 05:06.303
Long time no see.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.443
Too long, I'd say.

05:07.445 --> 05:08.278
Too long.

05:09.385 --> 05:10.453
Here, this is for you.

05:10.455 --> 05:11.603
Oh, thank you.

05:11.605 --> 05:15.247
2008, it's a terrible
year for real estate,

05:15.249 --> 05:17.293
great year for champagne though.

05:17.295 --> 05:18.145
Come on in, guys.

05:20.297 --> 05:21.434
Hey, you, guys!

05:21.436 --> 05:23.489
Hi, it's so good to finally meet you.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.840
Yeah, me too.

05:24.849 --> 05:25.766
Hey.
Hey.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.242
Eric has told us so much about you.

05:30.655 --> 05:32.213
Dude.

05:32.215 --> 05:33.048
For you.

05:33.955 --> 05:34.786
What's this?

05:34.788 --> 05:35.796
Open it up, man.

05:43.215 --> 05:44.388
Oh, my God!

05:47.705 --> 05:49.408
Dude, I thought we lost this picture.

05:49.410 --> 05:51.080
Yeah, right, crazy, huh?

05:51.082 --> 05:52.288
Where did you find this?

05:52.290 --> 05:53.923
Behind an old dresser, by chance.

05:53.925 --> 05:56.133
I thought you might like to have it.

05:56.135 --> 05:57.133
Yeah, you kidding?

05:57.135 --> 05:58.148
Thank you.

05:59.095 --> 06:02.203
This was right in the
middle of my divorce.

06:02.205 --> 06:03.553
Best getaway ever, dude.

06:03.555 --> 06:06.183
Yeah, except that fish hooked in my ass.

06:07.485 --> 06:08.979
You mean my favorite part?

06:10.395 --> 06:11.833
Dude, look at you!

06:11.835 --> 06:12.835
Damn!

06:12.837 --> 06:14.543
Wow!
That's nice.

06:14.545 --> 06:15.866
Thank you, you like it?

06:15.868 --> 06:16.723
Yeah.

06:16.725 --> 06:17.678
Monica did that.

06:19.014 --> 06:22.117
Aw, she's so modest,
but she's so talented.

06:22.775 --> 06:24.283
Dude, this is a great place.

06:24.285 --> 06:25.588
Great neighborhood too.

06:25.590 --> 06:27.023
Great, great neighborhood, man.

06:27.025 --> 06:28.543
That's what I keep saying, man.

06:28.545 --> 06:31.640
They're putting up 24 new
houses on this street alone.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.543
We're the first ones to move in.

06:33.545 --> 06:34.803
You know what that means?

06:34.805 --> 06:35.988
No, sir.

06:53.669 --> 06:56.763
We can party as loud
as we want to, dude!

06:56.765 --> 06:58.525
That's awesome, that's what's up!

06:58.527 --> 07:00.583
Oh, come on in, let's
open the champagne bottle.

07:00.585 --> 07:02.875
Yeah, sounds good.
How about that?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.543
I wanna propose a toast.

07:10.545 --> 07:12.695
Let's drink to our
friendship, and let's not wait

07:12.697 --> 07:15.407
another freaking two years
before we meet up again.

07:15.409 --> 07:16.410
Yes, sir.

07:16.412 --> 07:17.662
Cheers!

07:19.962 --> 07:21.393
That's it.

07:21.395 --> 07:23.688
I am so happy to see you, guys.

07:23.690 --> 07:25.946
We were hoping to have
you guys over once we had

07:25.948 --> 07:27.228
fully moved in, but...

07:28.165 --> 07:30.813
Dude, Jenna tells me
you're shipping off to Iraq

07:30.815 --> 07:32.933
again next week?

07:32.935 --> 07:36.313
Yes, sir, my third and last tour.

07:36.315 --> 07:37.148
Thank God.

07:39.369 --> 07:40.523
What's it like over there?

07:40.525 --> 07:42.967
Oh, you know, hot and
dirty just the way I like it.

07:42.969 --> 07:44.843
Aren't you scared?

07:44.845 --> 07:45.676
Of what?

07:45.678 --> 07:46.518
Dying?

07:47.093 --> 07:49.173
No, no, ma'am.

07:49.175 --> 07:50.551
How about that?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.634
What's it called, PT...?

07:52.636 --> 07:53.833
Oh, PTSD?

07:53.835 --> 07:54.666
Yeah.

07:54.668 --> 07:55.803
Posttraumatic stress disorder.

07:55.805 --> 07:58.693
We hear so much about
that in the news lately.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.235
Nah, I have seen some pretty awful stuff

08:01.237 --> 08:02.295
over there, but...

08:03.230 --> 08:05.630
But for some reason it
doesn't really affect me.

08:06.615 --> 08:08.173
You got any stories?

08:08.175 --> 08:09.111
Eric.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.570
He said it doesn't affect him.

08:11.572 --> 08:14.403
Nah, it's cool, it's cool, I don't mind.

08:14.405 --> 08:16.002
Most people are afraid to ask.

08:17.525 --> 08:18.939
So, yeah, my...

08:19.781 --> 08:21.943
My best buddy over there was
John, this big black dude,

08:21.945 --> 08:22.861
tough as nails.

08:24.265 --> 08:26.913
But he did have one weakness.

08:26.915 --> 08:29.313
He had a soft spot for the stray dogs.

08:29.315 --> 08:31.442
And the dogs, they knew it too.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.341
They would follow him around until

08:33.342 --> 08:35.649
he fed them his last beef jerky and stuff.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.484
It's cute.

08:37.965 --> 08:41.059
So, yeah, this real
sad-looking dog showed up one day

08:41.062 --> 08:43.136
and went directly up to big John.

08:43.953 --> 08:45.913
And the two hit it off right away,

08:45.915 --> 08:46.983
it was amazing to watch.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.936
It was like they already knew each other.

08:48.938 --> 08:51.919
John said to me: "Yo
Jason, dude, brother man!

08:53.062 --> 08:55.545
"This is the one, this is the one

08:55.547 --> 08:57.153
I'm gonna take home with me!

08:57.155 --> 08:58.063
And uh...

08:59.375 --> 09:01.619
He was cool as shit, Eric.

09:01.621 --> 09:03.963
He was cool as shit, man.

09:03.965 --> 09:06.423
Next thing we know there
was this huge explosion

09:06.425 --> 09:07.933
and we all got thrown back.

09:08.837 --> 09:12.163
And once the dust settled,
I turned to John and one arm

09:12.165 --> 09:13.838
and half his face was blown off.

09:15.279 --> 09:16.275
My God.

09:16.277 --> 09:17.903
Yeah, it was horrendous.

09:17.905 --> 09:20.893
He struggled in pain to
ask me one last thing.

09:20.895 --> 09:23.973
He asked if I could take
care of his new dog.

09:23.975 --> 09:26.898
I said, "Yes, sir, yes, absolutely."

09:28.357 --> 09:30.715
And... Then he died
right there in my arms.

09:35.265 --> 09:37.412
The thing he didn't know though

09:37.414 --> 09:40.401
was that the terrorists had put explosives

09:40.403 --> 09:44.026
within the dog's belly and
detonated it from afar.

09:44.028 --> 09:45.583
I'm sorry, man, that's terrible.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.613
Yes, sir, a lot of crazy
shit happens over there.

09:48.615 --> 09:51.237
Believe you me, and that's
just one of the mild stories,

09:51.239 --> 09:52.072
but uh...

09:52.690 --> 09:55.333
Anyway, we needn't gotta
talk about all that.

09:55.335 --> 09:56.620
So what have you been up to, dude,

09:56.622 --> 09:58.370
for the last couple of years

09:58.372 --> 09:59.703
that you can afford a place like this?

09:59.705 --> 10:00.743
God damn!

10:00.745 --> 10:01.843
Crazy!

10:01.845 --> 10:04.383
Well, you know, after
my divorce was finalized,

10:04.385 --> 10:07.273
I switched real estate
companies, same job description,

10:07.275 --> 10:09.899
just a fuck-ton more money.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.437
And that is where I met my sweetheart.

10:13.439 --> 10:14.272
Aw!

10:16.042 --> 10:16.875
Cute.

10:17.957 --> 10:21.333
Could you believe it, she was
working as the receptionist?

10:21.335 --> 10:22.243
Are you kidding me?

10:22.245 --> 10:24.843
First thing I see when I
walk in there, I'm thinking,

10:24.845 --> 10:26.376
"Wow, this chick's hot."

10:26.378 --> 10:27.211
Right?

10:28.285 --> 10:30.143
So I gotta get in for a closer look.

10:30.145 --> 10:33.273
I come up and that's when
I see the memento card

10:33.275 --> 10:35.543
she's got hanging behind
her and it's got a picture

10:35.545 --> 10:37.843
of a sold house on it and
it says, "If you liked it..."

10:37.845 --> 10:40.840
"If you liked it you
should've put a ring on it."

10:43.165 --> 10:46.356
I mean, for me it was
love at first sight.

10:46.358 --> 10:47.820
And for me it was love at...

10:47.822 --> 10:49.513
About the 10th sight?

10:50.985 --> 10:53.113
I wanna see your ring.

10:53.115 --> 10:53.948
Sure.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.983
Ooh, well done, Eric.

10:57.985 --> 10:58.816
Thank you.

10:58.818 --> 11:01.077
We'll be married end of next year.

11:01.079 --> 11:03.183
Oh, congratulations!

11:03.185 --> 11:05.043
That's really great, man.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.520
Thank you, thank you.

11:06.522 --> 11:08.163
You know what the best part is...

11:08.165 --> 11:10.703
She's got a 12-year-old
daughter named Emily.

11:10.705 --> 11:12.503
So we're gonna be like a real family.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.073
Oh, that's awesome, I'm
so happy for you, guys.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.013
Thank you.

11:16.015 --> 11:17.483
Where's the kiddo now?

11:17.485 --> 11:19.073
Oh, she's in her room,
watching all of the

11:19.075 --> 11:20.923
Lord of the Rings films.

11:20.925 --> 11:22.903
It's her birthday tomorrow.

11:22.905 --> 11:24.053
Nice.

11:25.273 --> 11:26.184
Ooh!

11:26.186 --> 11:28.126
That must be the Chinese food!

11:28.128 --> 11:29.295
Yay!

11:31.660 --> 11:33.577
This smells so amazing.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.013
Guys, this is Emily.

11:37.015 --> 11:37.846
Hi, everyone.

11:37.848 --> 11:39.113
Hi, Emily.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.987
- Hi, mom.
- Aw, you're so adorable!

11:41.989 --> 11:43.473
And some veggies, please.

11:43.475 --> 11:45.333
So, Emily, how is the movie?

11:45.335 --> 11:46.233
Oh, TD!

11:46.235 --> 11:48.205
I'm doing a Lord of the Rings marathon.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.013
TD means To Die.

11:50.015 --> 11:52.285
Yeah, I know, trust me.

11:52.287 --> 11:53.288
Oh, you do?

11:54.373 --> 11:56.583
How is the new tablet working
out with the headphones?

11:56.585 --> 11:57.543
Oh, great.

11:57.545 --> 11:58.643
Excellent.

11:58.645 --> 12:00.145
This is for you.
You want some of this?

12:00.147 --> 12:00.978
Uh-huh.

12:02.446 --> 12:04.173
How about some chicken?

12:04.175 --> 12:05.848
Yeah.
And veggies, please.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.303
All right, Mom
says you gotta have veggies.

12:08.305 --> 12:09.981
Throw some of those on your plate.

12:09.983 --> 12:11.144
Okay, okay.

12:14.129 --> 12:15.820
Is that dead fish?

12:27.358 --> 12:29.191
Light it up.

12:30.611 --> 12:32.610
Don't be stingy.

12:34.832 --> 12:37.108
I'm so glad you guys could make it.

12:38.935 --> 12:40.723
It's about time, right?

12:40.725 --> 12:41.558
It is.

12:46.045 --> 12:47.103
Like it?

12:47.105 --> 12:51.263
Oh, man, that's some
good shit right there!

12:51.265 --> 12:52.815
Nothing like that over in Iraq.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.683
No? What do they deal over there?

12:55.685 --> 12:56.638
Mainly weapons.

12:57.705 --> 13:00.221
I mean, they have some weed,
heroin and amphetamines,

13:00.223 --> 13:02.713
but let me tell you, they
ain't got weed like that!

13:02.715 --> 13:04.807
More drugs, less guns, I say.

13:04.809 --> 13:05.756
Good.

13:05.758 --> 13:06.828
I mean, really...

13:06.830 --> 13:08.423
Look at this room, okay?

13:08.425 --> 13:11.032
We've got four completely
different human beings,

13:11.034 --> 13:13.663
but we all get along.

13:13.665 --> 13:15.741
You know, we got the crazy military guy

13:15.743 --> 13:19.583
who's braver than any
son-of-a-bitch I've ever met.

13:19.585 --> 13:23.103
We've got the lovely and
caring kindergarten teacher

13:23.105 --> 13:26.793
shaping the future of this nation.

13:26.795 --> 13:31.483
We've got my sexy
receptionist-artist soon-to-be wife,

13:31.485 --> 13:33.607
who couldn't hurt a fly.

13:33.609 --> 13:35.659
And, you know, you got the asshole.

13:36.944 --> 13:39.196
Legit, you guys are here,
but I'm already thinking

13:39.198 --> 13:40.393
about my next deal.

13:40.395 --> 13:41.226
You know...

13:41.228 --> 13:44.905
But the fact is we all get along.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.561
And I just don't understand why the

13:46.563 --> 13:48.828
world can't just get along like that.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.113
Oh, you guys know, it's because

13:51.115 --> 13:52.738
of the different ideologies, man.

13:54.173 --> 13:59.043
You see, America, with all
its flaws, still stands

13:59.045 --> 14:01.203
for freedom and the pursuit of happiness.

14:01.205 --> 14:04.293
Our ideology here is to
create an environment for man

14:04.295 --> 14:08.640
to give them a shot, not
a guarantee, but a shot.

14:08.642 --> 14:10.803
A shot to become and
evolve into the person they

14:10.805 --> 14:13.233
really wanna be, you
know, self-determination,

14:13.235 --> 14:15.488
freedom of expression,
all that good stuff.

14:16.735 --> 14:20.263
But on the other hand,
we've got radical, crazy-ass

14:20.265 --> 14:23.232
Islamic terrorists who don't
give a shit about freedom.

14:23.823 --> 14:25.806
They only care about establishing a global

14:25.808 --> 14:27.320
totalitarian caliphate.

14:28.015 --> 14:29.511
A what?

14:31.595 --> 14:33.393
A caliphate, man.

14:33.395 --> 14:36.433
You know, a caliphate
means, it's an Islamic

14:36.435 --> 14:38.533
world with total control.

14:38.535 --> 14:42.373
They reject democracy, they
reject human rights values,

14:42.375 --> 14:44.253
they don't give a fuck.

14:44.255 --> 14:47.453
I just don't understand why
anyone would wanna do that.

14:53.615 --> 14:56.103
Because it's their ideology, man.

14:56.105 --> 14:58.213
They truly believe the end times are here,

14:58.215 --> 15:00.615
and they believe that
they're part of some cosmic

15:00.617 --> 15:02.103
struggle, and, of course...

15:02.105 --> 15:04.813
Of course, these assholes
are convinced they're

15:04.815 --> 15:08.988
the good guys, and with
the help of Allah...

15:11.395 --> 15:13.786
They're gonna defeat all
the enemies of Islam in a

15:13.788 --> 15:15.353
final climactic battle.

15:15.355 --> 15:17.443
And let me tell you something,
rest assured they are

15:17.445 --> 15:20.081
determined to use the
sword until everybody

15:20.083 --> 15:22.638
is a Muslim and obeys sharia law.

15:23.611 --> 15:25.513
Sharia law, that I heard of.

15:25.515 --> 15:26.346
Yeah.

15:26.348 --> 15:27.456
You see what I mean?

15:27.458 --> 15:29.243
Two different ideologies
opposed to each other,

15:29.245 --> 15:31.253
and that's why we have war, my friends.

15:31.255 --> 15:33.663
Yeah, different ideologies.

15:33.665 --> 15:36.530
It does make a lot of sense.

15:38.455 --> 15:40.283
It is so screwed up.

15:40.285 --> 15:43.533
So, speaking of ideologies...

15:43.535 --> 15:45.403
What's you guys' ideology?

15:45.405 --> 15:48.891
What's the most important
thing on the planet to you?

15:50.335 --> 15:52.353
Be all you can be.

15:52.355 --> 15:54.523
Yeah, okay, but what
does that like really mean?

15:54.525 --> 15:57.053
You gotta follow your heart.

15:57.055 --> 15:59.723
You gotta follow your true inner feelings.

15:59.725 --> 16:02.063
And you will ultimately
become all you can be.

16:02.065 --> 16:03.843
Give me that joint.

16:03.845 --> 16:05.173
Give me that.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.696
Your highest self.

16:09.465 --> 16:11.703
Sounds like someone's
been drinking too much

16:11.705 --> 16:12.998
of the army kool-aid.

16:14.525 --> 16:15.450
What about you, Jenna?

16:15.452 --> 16:16.427
What do you think?

16:16.827 --> 16:21.178
Oh, I don't know, I don't
usually ponder stuff like that.

16:25.725 --> 16:30.333
But I would say I am looking
forward to getting married...

16:33.045 --> 16:35.313
Having a family.

16:35.315 --> 16:38.290
Good kids is one of the
most important things.

16:38.292 --> 16:40.203
That is important.

16:40.205 --> 16:42.283
What about freedom?

16:42.285 --> 16:43.512
Or happiness?

16:45.525 --> 16:46.826
Or love?

16:46.828 --> 16:48.333
Or health?

16:48.335 --> 16:50.278
Well, maybe.

16:51.108 --> 16:53.227
Maybe it's a combination
of all those things.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.453
But first you need to have life

16:55.455 --> 16:56.918
before you can have anything.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.447
And that life needs to be free,

16:59.449 --> 17:01.811
then it can pursue happiness.

17:02.293 --> 17:06.042
Right, like life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness.

17:06.045 --> 17:08.063
That sounds familiar, right?

17:08.065 --> 17:08.896
Bingo!

17:08.897 --> 17:12.306
Declaration of Independence,
a very clever document!

17:14.230 --> 17:17.269
Let me ask you this, since
we're talking about ideologies

17:17.271 --> 17:19.869
and the meaning of life
and all that stuff...

17:21.444 --> 17:23.762
Have you guys ever tried DMT?

17:23.765 --> 17:25.403
You mean the spirit molecule?

17:25.405 --> 17:26.522
Yes, sir.

17:26.525 --> 17:27.358
No, sir.

17:27.967 --> 17:31.130
But I have heard a lot about
it from my military buddies

17:31.132 --> 17:34.033
and it's definitely on my bucket list.

17:34.035 --> 17:35.763
How about you, Jenna?

17:35.765 --> 17:36.613
Nope.

17:36.615 --> 17:40.343
Never tried it, but a friend
of mine told me about it.

17:40.345 --> 17:43.846
She said it was the most
amazing experience ever.

17:43.848 --> 17:45.883
It is.

17:45.885 --> 17:46.787
Actually.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.443
You tried it?

17:48.445 --> 17:49.803
Twice.

17:49.805 --> 17:53.853
I mean, it is literally
the best experience

17:53.855 --> 17:56.793
you will have in your life.

17:56.795 --> 18:00.623
It will change your point
of view on everything.

18:00.625 --> 18:03.238
You're getting me all
fucking excited over here.

18:04.155 --> 18:06.178
Tell me more, man, how's the trip?

18:07.205 --> 18:08.713
I don't know.

18:08.715 --> 18:12.323
But I can tell you what
I felt and what I felt

18:12.325 --> 18:15.393
was pure acceptance.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.843
Legit, I felt pure love.

18:18.845 --> 18:21.588
I mean it's something you got
to experience for yourselves.

18:23.205 --> 18:24.213
Do you want to?

18:26.135 --> 18:27.351
Say that again?

18:28.255 --> 18:30.112
Would you like to have this

18:30.114 --> 18:32.047
experience for yourself?

18:36.025 --> 18:37.158
Are you serious?

18:39.387 --> 18:42.068
A friend of mine happens
to be a very talented

18:42.070 --> 18:47.070
drug designer and he mixed
up a bag for me last week.

18:47.605 --> 18:51.738
95% pure DMT...

18:52.581 --> 18:54.713
With a little extra kick for you.

18:54.715 --> 18:55.856
Whoa.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.330
What's the extra kick?

18:59.264 --> 19:00.797
Who cares?

19:01.343 --> 19:04.086
He told me about it, but
I'm not good with all that

19:04.088 --> 19:07.055
scientific gobbledygook,
but I can tell you

19:07.057 --> 19:09.638
that it works like a charm,

19:09.640 --> 19:12.163
and it will open up your heart

19:12.165 --> 19:13.332
completely.

19:13.835 --> 19:15.209
What do you think, baby?

19:15.211 --> 19:16.119
You want some?

19:17.705 --> 19:20.083
I don't know, I'm a little scared.

19:20.085 --> 19:23.643
No, it's not dangerous at all.

19:23.645 --> 19:25.853
It's a natural product.

19:25.855 --> 19:30.633
Actually, DMT is what your
brain naturally releases

19:30.635 --> 19:32.061
when you dream.

19:32.063 --> 19:33.456
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.059
Yeah.

19:35.061 --> 19:36.063
Uh-huh.

19:36.065 --> 19:40.168
So, we've taken it twice, seriously.

19:42.475 --> 19:44.125
I definitely want to do it again.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.518
Hm.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.725
What do you think, you guys, game?

19:52.385 --> 19:55.865
Jason, don't be a pussy!

19:55.867 --> 19:57.693
Whoa, whoa, pussy?

19:57.695 --> 19:58.903
Oh!

19:58.905 --> 20:01.293
Don't push the puss.

20:01.295 --> 20:02.363
I won't push it.

20:02.365 --> 20:03.696
Fuck it, let's do it...

20:03.698 --> 20:04.879
I won't fuck it either.

20:04.881 --> 20:05.940
Light that shit up.

20:05.942 --> 20:08.317
Light that shit up,
motherfucker, light it up!

27:22.273 --> 27:24.083
Yeah, yeah.

27:24.085 --> 27:26.133
Hey, baby, where you been?

27:26.135 --> 27:27.813
Oh, I was just in the bathroom.

27:27.815 --> 27:28.648
I'm good.

27:31.035 --> 27:32.343
Hey, sweetie.

27:32.345 --> 27:33.176
Everything okay?

27:33.178 --> 27:34.486
How was the trip, sweetie?

27:34.488 --> 27:37.438
Dude, it was fucking amazing!

27:39.835 --> 27:40.893
Hm.

27:40.895 --> 27:43.290
I did it, guys, I became
a part of the entire

27:43.292 --> 27:46.673
collective unconsciousness.

27:46.675 --> 27:47.506
It was amazing.

27:47.508 --> 27:48.923
I wasn't even myself anymore.

27:48.925 --> 27:51.773
I was just this like
vibrating mass of light

27:51.775 --> 27:54.743
that got rid of everything bad in me.

27:54.745 --> 27:57.373
You know, and then my
heart completely opened up

27:57.375 --> 28:00.613
and pure love just poured in.

28:00.615 --> 28:01.773
Wow.

28:01.775 --> 28:02.925
It was amazing, dude.

28:04.945 --> 28:07.153
What about you, babe, how was your trip?

28:07.155 --> 28:08.608
It was incredible.

28:09.750 --> 28:13.065
I mean, I was propelled to this place

28:13.067 --> 28:16.023
filled with colored rings.

28:16.025 --> 28:17.807
They engaged in...

28:18.115 --> 28:20.488
In an activity of some sort.

28:21.329 --> 28:24.953
Like a bright world of living

28:24.955 --> 28:29.005
Geometry, infinite spirit or something.

28:30.605 --> 28:33.288
I mean, I know it sounds weird, but...

28:33.612 --> 28:35.712
my heart opened...

28:36.439 --> 28:38.693
just like Eric said.

28:38.695 --> 28:43.136
And negativity just left me...

28:44.136 --> 28:47.361
And I felt pure love.

28:52.335 --> 28:53.793
How was your experience?

28:55.909 --> 28:59.071
Oh, yeah, mine wasn't so great.

28:59.073 --> 29:01.481
It started off all right,
and I saw all kinds

29:01.483 --> 29:02.895
of beautiful shit, but...

29:06.130 --> 29:08.447
Then everything suddenly
turned dark, and this

29:08.449 --> 29:12.136
black fucking smoke,
you know, like in Lost,

29:12.138 --> 29:13.828
freaking attacked me, man.

29:15.245 --> 29:18.158
I woke up and had to run to
the bathroom to throw up.

29:18.650 --> 29:21.463
Oh, baby, I'm sorry to hear that.

29:21.465 --> 29:22.470
Are you feeling better?

29:22.472 --> 29:24.648
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.070
Sorry, I've never heard
of anyone having a bad trip

29:28.072 --> 29:28.930
on that stuff.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.976
Yeah, I was thinking,
maybe it was that something

29:31.978 --> 29:34.193
extra your buddy mixed in there.

29:34.195 --> 29:35.028
I don't know.

29:36.085 --> 29:37.813
Yeah, maybe.

29:37.815 --> 29:40.023
Uh, beer, anybody?

29:40.025 --> 29:41.723
Yeah, I'll have one, thanks.

29:41.725 --> 29:43.275
Sounds great, thanks...

29:43.277 --> 29:45.110
I'll have one.

33:11.925 --> 33:13.783
Oh, hey, Emily, what's up?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.293
How's the movie?

33:15.295 --> 33:16.408
Uh, great.

33:17.718 --> 33:19.643
What are you doing?

33:19.645 --> 33:20.633
Nothing.

33:20.635 --> 33:23.700
I'm just chatting online
with a friend of mine.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.542
Hm, you're funny.

33:26.334 --> 33:27.740
Yeah...

33:28.985 --> 33:30.698
And you're so beautiful, Emily.

33:31.862 --> 33:33.713
Oh, no, I'm not.

33:33.715 --> 33:34.971
What are you talking about?

33:34.973 --> 33:36.021
Of course you are.

33:36.023 --> 33:37.833
You're incredibly beautiful.

33:37.835 --> 33:38.993
Look at you!

33:38.995 --> 33:40.693
No, your girlfriend is beautiful.

33:40.695 --> 33:43.113
Yeah, well, that's true...

33:43.115 --> 33:46.503
But compared to you, you are perfect.

33:46.505 --> 33:47.861
Come here for a second.

33:49.185 --> 33:51.185
Oh, come on, I'm not gonna bite you.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.298
Okay.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.178
Good.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.339
Roll up your shirt a little bit

33:56.341 --> 33:57.883
so I can see your belly button.

33:59.183 --> 34:00.089
Uh.

34:00.091 --> 34:01.683
Oh, come on, just roll it up.

34:01.685 --> 34:03.168
I wanna show you something.

34:04.635 --> 34:08.920
Good, just a little bit higher,
just below your chest there.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.348
Nice.

34:12.262 --> 34:13.888
Now pull down your pajama pants.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.052
Uh.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.435
Just a little
bit below your hip bones.

34:18.614 --> 34:19.447
Okay.

34:19.871 --> 34:21.313
Just a little further.

34:22.554 --> 34:23.783
Wow!

34:23.784 --> 34:25.853
You are perfect.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.655
You know, you could be a supermodel.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.978
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.

34:31.748 --> 34:35.518
Give me one of those supermodel
smiles, with some attitude.

34:36.755 --> 34:37.620
Damn!

34:37.621 --> 34:38.725
Work it.

34:39.415 --> 34:41.614
Yeah, that's it, nice.

34:42.299 --> 34:43.132
Very nice.

34:43.826 --> 34:46.783
Now turn the mirror and look at yourself.

34:46.784 --> 34:47.618
Yeah.

34:48.925 --> 34:49.757
Wow!

34:50.891 --> 34:53.241
Look at your long brown beautiful hair.

34:55.072 --> 34:57.667
Your sexy flat tummy.

34:57.669 --> 34:59.108
You're silly.

34:59.110 --> 35:01.021
And you're a supermodel.

35:01.023 --> 35:03.283
Uh... I'm gonna finish my movie now.

35:03.285 --> 35:05.482
Yeah, okay, you go do that.

35:59.259 --> 36:00.090
Deeper?

36:21.340 --> 36:24.645
Jason, don't be a pussy!

36:24.647 --> 36:27.122
We've got the crazy military guy.

36:27.124 --> 36:28.621
How was the trip?

36:28.623 --> 36:31.814
Dude, it was fucking amazing!

37:20.573 --> 37:21.581
Angry.

37:42.265 --> 37:43.098
Fuck!

37:44.950 --> 37:46.892
You're fucking right!

37:46.901 --> 37:48.026
Motherfucker!

37:55.885 --> 37:56.973
Speaking of lunch.

37:56.975 --> 37:57.878
You hungry at all?

37:57.887 --> 37:59.293
You want any food?

37:59.295 --> 38:03.310
We've got some snacks for you
chips, peanuts, chocolate.

38:03.312 --> 38:06.153
Oh, no, no, I'm stuffed, thanks.

38:06.155 --> 38:07.623
It's not a problem.

38:07.625 --> 38:08.604
Hey, what's going on?

38:08.606 --> 38:10.170
What are you guys talking about?

38:10.172 --> 38:12.170
Just offering your missus some snacks.

38:13.275 --> 38:14.483
Snacks?

38:14.485 --> 38:15.316
Hm.

38:15.318 --> 38:17.301
You know, Jenna doesn't
need to be catered to,

38:17.303 --> 38:18.545
especially not by you, brother.

38:20.145 --> 38:22.325
Um, okay, buddy.

38:22.327 --> 38:24.955
Oh, no, don't buddy me, man.

38:26.785 --> 38:28.173
Honey, what's wrong?

38:28.175 --> 38:29.113
Nothing.

38:29.115 --> 38:30.969
Go on, what were you guys talking about?

38:30.971 --> 38:32.260
We were talking about...

38:32.262 --> 38:33.828
Dude, seriously, man.

38:35.265 --> 38:36.828
I was asking my girlfriend.

38:37.745 --> 38:39.213
Why you always cut everybody off?

38:39.215 --> 38:40.298
It's rude, man.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.143
Okay.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.072
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

38:44.074 --> 38:46.178
Go on, Jenna, what were you saying?

38:49.095 --> 38:52.363
Um, yeah, so we were
talking about never discussing

38:52.365 --> 38:54.433
politics and religion at work.

38:54.435 --> 38:56.033
I see.

38:56.035 --> 38:57.202
You agree with that?

38:58.575 --> 39:00.513
Yeah, I think it's probably a good idea.

39:00.515 --> 39:01.932
And why is that?

39:02.495 --> 39:04.796
Because, Jason, these
could be sensitive subjects

39:04.798 --> 39:06.808
for people and you might offend someone.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.703
You think I might get offended?

39:11.125 --> 39:12.233
I don't know.

39:12.235 --> 39:13.633
You don't know?

39:17.122 --> 39:19.405
Dude, aren't we something
like best friends, man?

39:20.345 --> 39:22.373
Yeah, I think so.

39:22.375 --> 39:24.233
But you have no idea
if you can talk to me

39:24.235 --> 39:25.513
about religion or politics?

39:25.515 --> 39:28.163
I'm just saying, maybe
we're not as good of friends

39:28.165 --> 39:28.996
as we thought?

39:28.998 --> 39:31.343
Maybe we're not best friends, at all.

39:31.345 --> 39:32.856
Baby, what are you doing?

39:34.905 --> 39:36.163
You gonna answer me?

39:37.595 --> 39:39.623
I don't know what to say.

39:39.625 --> 39:41.614
You don't know what to say?

39:41.616 --> 39:43.568
You're a sneaky motherfucker, aren't you?

39:44.502 --> 39:45.333
What?

39:45.335 --> 39:46.873
You heard me.

39:46.875 --> 39:48.428
Why would you say that to me?

39:49.493 --> 39:51.558
Do you look me in the
eye and tell me you have

39:51.560 --> 39:53.427
no idea what I'm talking about?

39:54.362 --> 39:57.273
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

39:57.275 --> 39:58.108
Is that right?

40:05.671 --> 40:07.004
What the fuck?

40:13.255 --> 40:15.583
Be careful with that,
Jason, it's a powerful tool.

40:15.585 --> 40:17.373
It holds three-inch nails, bro.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.793
What the fuck are you doing?

40:19.795 --> 40:20.628
Okay, buddy.

40:21.975 --> 40:22.806
Let's think again.

40:22.808 --> 40:24.383
Isn't there anything you wanna tell me?

40:24.385 --> 40:26.033
Baby, what are you doing?

40:26.035 --> 40:28.903
Oh, I'm sorry, is there
something you wanna tell me?

40:28.905 --> 40:29.736
No!

40:29.738 --> 40:30.569
Jason.

40:30.571 --> 40:32.546
One more word and I'm gonna shoot you

40:32.548 --> 40:33.379
in your fucking face.

40:33.381 --> 40:34.382
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

40:34.384 --> 40:35.663
What the fuck is wrong with you?

40:35.665 --> 40:37.723
You like my girlfriend, don't you, bro?

40:37.725 --> 40:38.556
What?

40:38.558 --> 40:39.575
You heard me, man!

40:39.577 --> 40:41.170
Don't you fucking play innocent!

40:41.172 --> 40:42.133
I know what's going on here.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.383
What the fuck are you talking about?

40:43.385 --> 40:44.566
There's nothing going on.

40:44.568 --> 40:46.832
You better fucking man up and admit it!

40:46.834 --> 40:47.665
Admit what?

40:49.921 --> 40:51.709
Are you fucking crazy?

40:51.711 --> 40:52.925
Stop it!

40:52.927 --> 40:53.758
Sit down!

40:53.760 --> 40:54.591
Sit the fuck down!

40:54.593 --> 40:55.622
And don't you move again!

40:55.624 --> 40:56.708
You understand me?

40:56.710 --> 40:57.541
Jason!

40:57.543 --> 40:58.374
Listen to me.

40:58.376 --> 41:00.248
You stay right where
you at and don't you

41:00.250 --> 41:01.356
fucking move either!

41:05.055 --> 41:07.060
I know you fucked my
girlfriend, but I wanna hear it

41:07.062 --> 41:07.893
from you now!

41:07.895 --> 41:09.203
What?

41:09.205 --> 41:11.043
You better fucking come
clean or I'll put one

41:11.045 --> 41:12.703
right in your motherfucking skull!

41:12.705 --> 41:14.843
What the fuck has
gotten into you, Jason?

41:14.845 --> 41:16.453
I've never laid a finger on her, ever!

41:16.455 --> 41:18.345
You're lying to
me, you son of a bitch!

41:18.347 --> 41:20.253
No, he is telling the truth!

41:20.255 --> 41:22.023
I don't know why you
would even think that!

41:22.025 --> 41:23.343
Nothing happened between us.

41:23.345 --> 41:24.935
Stop lying to me the both of you!

41:24.937 --> 41:26.933
I'm not fucking stupid!

41:26.935 --> 41:28.553
This is your last chance to admit it.

41:28.555 --> 41:30.793
Please, stop!

41:30.795 --> 41:31.626
One...

41:31.628 --> 41:33.502
- Please, please, please!
- Two...

41:34.284 --> 41:35.532
- Three.
- Okay!

41:35.534 --> 41:36.622
I'm sorry.

41:36.624 --> 41:38.338
Yes, we had sex, one time!

41:39.497 --> 41:40.478
I fucking knew it!

41:40.480 --> 41:41.570
Why would you say that,

41:41.572 --> 41:42.445
you know it's not true.

41:42.447 --> 41:44.626
Because I'm trying to
save my fucking life, Jenna!

41:44.635 --> 41:46.334
Yeah, he just did.

41:59.816 --> 42:01.847
No, no, don't!

42:07.282 --> 42:08.883
Jason, you're fucking paranoid!

42:08.885 --> 42:09.918
Please!

42:13.577 --> 42:16.376
Sit your ass
on that fucking chair!

42:16.378 --> 42:17.211
Relax!

42:26.078 --> 42:27.228
What the fuck, Jason?

42:27.230 --> 42:28.286
Shut your mouth!

42:28.288 --> 42:29.196
Jason, let her go!

42:33.385 --> 42:34.218
Okay.

42:35.435 --> 42:37.433
Now it's your turn to tell me the truth.

42:37.435 --> 42:41.393
Jason, we've been telling
you the truth this whole time!

42:41.395 --> 42:44.427
There has never been
anything between Eric and me.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.492
Uh-huh.

42:45.494 --> 42:47.183
Never!

42:47.185 --> 42:49.863
I love you, and only you.

42:49.865 --> 42:51.895
Yeah, that's what I thought too, but...

42:53.285 --> 42:55.143
things are obviously different now, so...

42:55.145 --> 42:58.803
No, nothing is different,
you're just confused.

42:58.805 --> 42:59.913
No, no, no, no.

42:59.915 --> 43:01.743
I'm not confused!

43:01.745 --> 43:03.603
Quite the opposite, I've never seen things

43:03.605 --> 43:05.098
so fucking crystal clear!

43:11.407 --> 43:13.717
You lie to me one more fucking
time and I'm gonna shoot you

43:13.719 --> 43:15.323
right in your fucking eye.

43:15.325 --> 43:17.148
You would never do that to me.

43:18.405 --> 43:19.953
You love me, don't you?

43:19.955 --> 43:20.788
One...

43:23.155 --> 43:24.680
Fucking two...

43:27.265 --> 43:28.230
Three!

43:28.232 --> 43:29.326
Fuck!

43:29.793 --> 43:31.025
Fuck!

43:34.635 --> 43:36.950
Jason, no, leave her alone!

43:39.732 --> 43:40.746
Stop!

43:40.748 --> 43:42.429
Jason, let her go!

43:42.431 --> 43:44.497
Please, let her go, please!

43:45.445 --> 43:46.853
Jason, she can't breathe!

43:46.855 --> 43:47.688
Stop!

43:52.428 --> 43:53.928
And?

43:54.902 --> 43:56.441
Are you ready to tell me the truth now?

43:58.170 --> 44:00.013
Stop it, are you fucking crazy?

44:00.015 --> 44:00.990
Stop!

44:00.992 --> 44:02.637
You're gonna kill her, man.

44:03.580 --> 44:04.413
Jason, please!

44:09.423 --> 44:11.273
Are you gonna tell me now?

44:11.873 --> 44:12.839
No?

44:14.037 --> 44:15.363
No!
Stop!

44:15.365 --> 44:16.931
No, please! I admit it!

44:16.933 --> 44:19.325
What, what did you say?

44:19.327 --> 44:21.541
I admit it.

44:23.518 --> 44:25.613
I thought you
said nothing happened.

44:25.615 --> 44:30.208
No, we had sex, once, just as Eric said.

44:31.889 --> 44:34.958
It was a mistake and we both regretted it.

44:37.735 --> 44:38.568
I'm sorry.

44:48.245 --> 44:49.636
Okay, folks.

44:50.835 --> 44:52.278
I got a solution.

44:55.105 --> 44:57.038
There's only one way to make this even.

45:03.345 --> 45:05.723
You fucked my girlfriend...

45:05.725 --> 45:07.313
Now I'm gonna fuck yours.

45:07.315 --> 45:08.148
Fuck you!

45:10.585 --> 45:11.538
Monica, get up.

45:11.938 --> 45:12.769
Please.

45:12.771 --> 45:14.643
Monica, don't do
it, don't do what he says!

45:14.645 --> 45:17.003
Do not fucking touch her!

45:17.005 --> 45:18.313
Do you hear me?

45:18.315 --> 45:19.148
Don't touch her!

45:19.995 --> 45:22.138
Jason, leave her alone!

45:22.739 --> 45:24.450
Jason, stop!

45:24.452 --> 45:26.267
Fuck, don't even think about it!

45:33.562 --> 45:35.473
Didn't I say get up?

45:35.475 --> 45:36.428
Fuck you!

45:37.095 --> 45:39.763
Just do what I say,
everybody's gonna be A-okay.

45:39.765 --> 45:40.667
Fuck you, Jason!

45:40.669 --> 45:42.008
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

45:42.010 --> 45:43.013
Oh, dude, really?

45:43.015 --> 45:44.004
Are you serious?

45:44.006 --> 45:45.168
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

45:47.145 --> 45:49.763
Dude, I'm telling you, man,
one more fucking word from you

45:49.765 --> 45:52.480
and I swear to God you're
not gonna survive this, okay?

45:52.482 --> 45:53.313
Fuck you!

45:53.315 --> 45:55.587
Do you want your future husband
to have a hole in his head

45:55.589 --> 45:56.926
or are you gonna do this for him?

45:56.928 --> 45:58.284
No, please!

45:58.286 --> 45:59.231
Huh?

45:59.233 --> 46:00.630
- I'll do whatever you say.
- Yeah?

46:00.632 --> 46:01.470
Monica, no!

46:01.472 --> 46:02.994
Don't fucking do it!

46:02.996 --> 46:04.573
Don't do anything he says, Monica.

46:04.575 --> 46:06.631
Don't fucking, please,
don't fucking do it!

46:09.467 --> 46:10.736
Stop!

46:10.738 --> 46:12.907
Stop, you can have me!

46:12.909 --> 46:14.237
You can have me.

46:14.239 --> 46:16.341
You see, that wasn't so hard, was it?

46:16.343 --> 46:17.803
That was pretty easy.

46:17.805 --> 46:19.413
And look, look at here.

46:19.415 --> 46:20.863
He's gonna be fine.

46:20.865 --> 46:22.833
You don't have to worry about him.

46:22.835 --> 46:24.533
Yeah, yeah, you stand right there

46:24.535 --> 46:25.653
in the middle of the room.

46:25.655 --> 46:28.133
Right here in front of Eric.

46:28.135 --> 46:29.783
Yeah, that's it.

46:29.785 --> 46:31.285
Now turn and face me.

46:34.755 --> 46:35.898
Take off your dress.

46:37.025 --> 46:38.965
Monica, please,
don't fucking do it!

46:38.967 --> 46:41.158
Please, don't fucking do it!

46:46.000 --> 46:47.192
That's it.

46:50.716 --> 46:52.299
Wow, you're pretty.

46:54.341 --> 46:56.033
Take off your bra, Monica.

46:57.241 --> 46:58.072
It's okay.

46:58.074 --> 46:59.396
Please.

46:59.398 --> 47:00.398
It's okay.

47:08.787 --> 47:10.323
Wow.

47:10.325 --> 47:11.763
Very, very nice, Monica.

47:11.765 --> 47:13.238
Now take off your panties.

47:14.875 --> 47:15.708
Take them off.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.638
That's fucking hot right there.

47:21.893 --> 47:22.775
Huh?

47:24.383 --> 47:25.949
What do you think, Jenna?

47:25.951 --> 47:27.962
Look at her.

47:27.964 --> 47:29.876
Isn't she hot?

47:29.878 --> 47:31.196
Huh?

47:31.198 --> 47:32.059
Look.

47:32.061 --> 47:34.321
No, don't look at me, look at her, look.

47:34.329 --> 47:36.163
Isn't she hot?

47:36.165 --> 47:38.487
Oh, come on, you like her too, don't you?

47:38.489 --> 47:39.335
Don't you?

47:39.337 --> 47:41.063
You wouldn't mind getting it
on with her either, would you?

47:41.065 --> 47:42.143
Huh?

47:42.145 --> 47:43.372
I knew it.

47:43.989 --> 47:44.843
I knew it.

47:45.001 --> 47:45.901
I knew it.

47:47.095 --> 47:48.673
Yeah.

47:48.675 --> 47:51.723
Monica, come lay down
on the couch over here.

47:51.725 --> 47:52.753
Don't you fucking touch her!

47:52.755 --> 47:55.304
You lay a finger on her
and I'm gonna kill you!

47:55.306 --> 47:56.403
It's a fucking promise!

47:56.405 --> 47:59.633
I swear to God, man,
first of all, first of all,

47:59.635 --> 48:02.213
don't promise something
you can't keep, okay?

48:02.215 --> 48:05.083
And second, second!

48:05.085 --> 48:06.878
Don't be so fucking dramatic!

48:07.725 --> 48:09.673
You're the one that touched
my girlfriend first,

48:09.675 --> 48:11.633
and I didn't fucking
kill you either, did I?

48:11.635 --> 48:13.853
I never fucking laid a finger on her!

48:13.855 --> 48:15.293
Oh, boy, oh boy!

48:15.295 --> 48:17.110
Here we go, here we go, here we go!

48:17.112 --> 48:19.623
With all the fucking craziness!

48:19.625 --> 48:22.963
Lying-ass, motherfucker,
you're lying to me!

48:22.965 --> 48:25.883
You just let your little
sweetheart Monica make up

48:25.885 --> 48:27.403
for your fucking mistakes.

48:27.405 --> 48:30.179
Monica, come over here
and lie down on the couch.

48:30.181 --> 48:31.213
And stop crying.

48:31.215 --> 48:32.048
Get over here.

48:33.102 --> 48:34.883
There you go.

48:34.885 --> 48:36.120
Fuck you!

48:36.122 --> 48:36.955
Fuck you!

48:44.723 --> 48:46.169
Motherfucker!

48:46.171 --> 48:47.379
Son of a bitch!

48:49.821 --> 48:51.779
No, you fucking monster!

48:51.781 --> 48:53.731
Monica, Monica!

48:54.419 --> 48:56.518
You fucking killed her!

48:56.520 --> 48:58.065
- Wake up.
- You fucking killed her!

48:58.067 --> 48:59.164
Wake the fuck up.

48:59.166 --> 48:59.999
Wake up!

49:00.958 --> 49:02.657
Fucking shit!

49:03.440 --> 49:05.106
You're fucking dead, you hear me?

49:05.108 --> 49:07.423
Dude, what are you
babbling about now for?

49:07.425 --> 49:08.413
What, what?

49:08.415 --> 49:09.613
Look at you!

49:09.615 --> 49:10.553
You got nothing.

49:10.555 --> 49:11.386
No power.

49:11.388 --> 49:12.903
Zero, bro!

49:12.905 --> 49:13.763
Zero!

49:13.765 --> 49:15.093
And I'm not even, you know what?

49:15.095 --> 49:16.848
I'm not even fucking done here yet.

49:17.825 --> 49:18.658
Huh?

49:19.613 --> 49:20.863
How about that?

49:21.368 --> 49:22.590
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

49:23.024 --> 49:24.474
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

49:28.715 --> 49:29.548
Monica!

49:30.935 --> 49:32.483
Fuck you, you fucking bastard!

49:32.485 --> 49:34.401
I'm gonna kill you, you fucking monster!

49:38.412 --> 49:40.815
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

49:40.817 --> 49:41.842
Fuck you!

49:41.844 --> 49:42.677
Fucking monster!

49:43.003 --> 49:43.836
Monica!

49:44.475 --> 49:45.631
Monica!

49:45.633 --> 49:46.574
Fuck you!

49:46.576 --> 49:48.107
I'm gonna destroy you!

49:48.109 --> 49:49.948
Oh, my God!

49:49.950 --> 49:51.438
Now we're even.

49:51.440 --> 49:52.703
Oh, my God!

49:52.705 --> 49:56.676
Eric, that was, amazing, bro.

49:56.678 --> 49:58.133
Fuck you, you
fucking piece of shit!

49:58.135 --> 50:00.014
You're never gonna get away with this.

50:00.016 --> 50:01.493
I'm never gonna get away with this?

50:01.495 --> 50:03.493
I think I just did, man.

50:03.495 --> 50:04.843
You're the one who got caught.

50:04.845 --> 50:05.838
Look at you!

50:05.840 --> 50:07.293
What can you do?

50:07.295 --> 50:08.243
Nothing!

50:08.245 --> 50:09.403
Zero!

50:09.405 --> 50:10.676
You have no power, dude!

50:10.678 --> 50:13.953
Wow, dude, you're so delusional, man!

50:13.955 --> 50:15.573
It's embarrassing.

50:15.575 --> 50:16.773
It really is.

50:16.775 --> 50:19.614
It's pathetic.

50:19.616 --> 50:21.798
You should be ashamed of yourself.

50:23.826 --> 50:25.196
Monica.

50:56.751 --> 50:57.584
Wow.

51:12.465 --> 51:15.113
What the fuck is wrong with him?

51:15.115 --> 51:16.537
I have no idea.

51:16.539 --> 51:18.322
I've never seen him like this.

51:20.235 --> 51:23.398
Hey, what's going on, guys?

51:24.385 --> 51:25.378
Just hanging out?

51:26.310 --> 51:27.600
That's nice.

51:39.039 --> 51:41.042
Hm, that's...

51:41.725 --> 51:42.558
Nice.

51:44.975 --> 51:46.375
That would be something new.

51:47.365 --> 51:48.565
What do you think, Eric?

51:50.185 --> 51:51.318
Any last words?

51:52.835 --> 51:53.938
Fuck you, Jason.

51:54.917 --> 51:56.163
Really?

51:56.165 --> 51:59.955
I think it would make a lot
more sense if you would beg or

51:59.957 --> 52:03.273
ask for forgiveness or something!

52:03.275 --> 52:04.275
Go to hell, Jason.

52:04.983 --> 52:06.159
Okay.

52:06.161 --> 52:07.952
Go to fucking hell!

52:12.505 --> 52:14.332
Jason, leave him alone!

52:14.334 --> 52:16.858
Oh, God, now you're talking again.

52:19.605 --> 52:24.418
It's your last chance to
consider your last words.

52:24.420 --> 52:27.543
You are the biggest piece
of shit I've ever seen.

52:27.545 --> 52:29.935
You're a little fucking bitch, Jason.

52:29.937 --> 52:31.423
A little fucking bitch.

52:31.425 --> 52:36.241
Narcissist, evil motherfucker,
that's what you are.

52:36.243 --> 52:37.358
Wow!

52:38.595 --> 52:41.188
You know, after all these years, man...

52:41.190 --> 52:44.099
I really thought we were best friends.

52:44.101 --> 52:44.979
Fuck you!

52:44.981 --> 52:46.833
You're fucking pathetic!

52:47.191 --> 52:48.024
You see?

52:49.656 --> 52:51.110
You see?

52:51.635 --> 52:53.598
The real truth finally comes out.

52:54.617 --> 52:56.821
Jason, please, don't hurt anyone else.

52:56.823 --> 52:58.667
Why did we pretend for so long?

53:03.215 --> 53:05.303
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this.

53:05.305 --> 53:06.452
Don't do it!

53:30.960 --> 53:33.576
Whoa, whoa!

53:35.014 --> 53:36.273
Oh, my God!

53:54.159 --> 53:56.283
Oh, I feel good.

53:56.285 --> 53:57.935
I gotta tell you something, Jenna.

53:57.937 --> 53:59.637
I've never felt more...

54:02.055 --> 54:03.188
Powerful...

54:05.378 --> 54:06.803
In my entire life.

54:06.805 --> 54:08.978
I mean, I feel completely free.

54:09.925 --> 54:11.108
Can you smell that?

54:27.324 --> 54:28.597
Mmm.

54:48.087 --> 54:49.503
Look at this.

54:50.345 --> 54:52.567
Oh, my God!

54:53.475 --> 54:55.213
Oh, my God!

54:55.215 --> 54:57.748
I'm fucking getting more powerful...

55:00.045 --> 55:00.968
By the minute.

55:01.842 --> 55:04.638
You've gone completely crazy.

55:04.640 --> 55:05.471
I've gone crazy?

55:05.473 --> 55:06.304
Okay.

55:06.306 --> 55:08.086
Look, let me tell you something:

55:08.088 --> 55:11.291
What happened here, right here, tonight...

55:14.295 --> 55:15.523
Was not my fault.

55:15.525 --> 55:16.356
Okay?

55:16.358 --> 55:17.396
It wasn't.

55:17.398 --> 55:19.943
Monica was the one who
attacked me, didn't she?

55:19.945 --> 55:21.153
Didn't she?

55:21.155 --> 55:22.578
Can you blame her?

55:23.715 --> 55:26.060
Sweetheart, we had a simple deal!

55:26.062 --> 55:27.523
We had a simple deal!

55:27.525 --> 55:31.389
And she had to go and screwed it all up.

55:33.172 --> 55:36.746
I mean, fuck me, it wasn't my fault!

55:36.748 --> 55:37.579
Okay?

55:37.581 --> 55:39.283
It wasn't my fault.

55:39.285 --> 55:40.647
You're delusional.
Oh, God.

55:40.649 --> 55:41.982
And you're a monster!

55:45.005 --> 55:47.468
Okay, put the guilt trip
on me, I'm the bad guy,

55:47.470 --> 55:50.112
I'm the bad guy, I'm the bad guy!

55:51.275 --> 55:52.623
Why am I the bad guy?

55:52.625 --> 55:55.293
Because I'm seizing the
opportunity to step up

55:55.295 --> 55:59.010
to the next level here
and become who I truly am?

55:59.012 --> 56:01.020
Who I truly am!

56:02.215 --> 56:03.443
Who are you truly?

56:03.445 --> 56:05.423
Something more than
I am fucking right now,

56:05.425 --> 56:06.893
that's for sure.

56:06.895 --> 56:09.313
I can tell you that, I can tell you that.

56:09.315 --> 56:11.706
I can clearly feel it in my heart!

56:13.417 --> 56:15.278
Just pounding.

56:16.845 --> 56:18.978
And you know, and as you know...

56:20.125 --> 56:21.583
"The heart wants what it wants."

56:21.585 --> 56:23.618
Emily Dickinson wrote that.

56:24.335 --> 56:26.473
Fuck, she was wrong.

56:26.475 --> 56:28.043
And she was a recluse.

56:28.045 --> 56:30.074
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

56:30.076 --> 56:31.443
And what about Steve Jobs?

56:31.445 --> 56:34.288
"Be brave enough to follow your heart!"

56:37.275 --> 56:38.106
Really?

56:38.108 --> 56:40.040
"And your feelings, because they know

56:40.042 --> 56:41.118
what you really want."

56:41.120 --> 56:45.044
Well, everybody knows that
Steve Jobs was an asshole!

56:45.046 --> 56:46.883
Why listen to him?

56:46.885 --> 56:50.453
Because he was extremely
successful, and he did,

56:50.455 --> 56:53.133
he influenced a lot of people, Jenna.

56:53.135 --> 56:56.023
Hitler was extremely
successful and influenced

56:56.025 --> 56:57.603
a lot of people.

56:57.605 --> 56:58.436
Jesus Christ!

56:58.438 --> 57:01.203
You're fucking stressing me out!

57:01.205 --> 57:02.493
Jesus Christ.

57:02.495 --> 57:05.073
You do this every fucking time, you know.

57:05.075 --> 57:07.823
But this argument here
you're not gonna win,

57:07.825 --> 57:09.833
let me tell you that.

57:09.835 --> 57:11.213
Mm-mm.

57:11.215 --> 57:12.498
Those days are over.

57:14.345 --> 57:17.258
That's, that's for damn fucking sure!

57:18.355 --> 57:19.548
That's for damn sure!

57:22.249 --> 57:23.082
For sure.

57:29.867 --> 57:31.092
Anybody home?

57:34.714 --> 57:35.547
For sure.

57:48.028 --> 57:49.368
I feel great!

58:01.087 --> 58:01.920
Yeah.

58:10.830 --> 58:12.155
That's how I feel.

58:20.941 --> 58:21.772
Phew!

58:21.774 --> 58:22.799
Wow, Jenna...

58:26.562 --> 58:28.393
Phew!

58:28.395 --> 58:30.143
Keep your seatbelt on.

58:30.145 --> 58:31.643
This is a rough fucking ride...

58:31.645 --> 58:32.648
Fuck you!

58:33.577 --> 58:35.219
When I first met you.

58:36.075 --> 58:36.906
Huh?

58:36.908 --> 58:38.550
When I first met you...

58:39.145 --> 58:41.218
I was so crazy in love with you.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.068
Fuck!

58:44.070 --> 58:45.963
What I love you for
now, I love you for what

58:45.965 --> 58:47.023
you represent to me.

58:47.025 --> 58:50.503
I love you for giving me
the opportunity to step up

58:50.505 --> 58:51.885
to the next level.

58:51.887 --> 58:53.295
What next level?

58:55.219 --> 58:57.453
Levels of power!

58:57.455 --> 59:01.753
Soon I'll be unleashed and, and, and...

59:01.755 --> 59:03.353
I'll become whatever I wanna be.

59:03.355 --> 59:05.705
What do you think you're
gonna do after this?

59:07.909 --> 59:10.693
Do you really think that you're
gonna get away with this?

59:10.695 --> 59:12.648
Yeah, I am. Here's what I'm gonna do:

59:12.650 --> 59:15.220
I'm gonna go back to Iraq
and I'm gonna show them

59:15.222 --> 59:16.405
what I can really do!

59:18.075 --> 59:20.052
Soon I'll become Captain...

59:21.102 --> 59:23.377
Then Colonel, then General, and...

59:24.152 --> 59:24.985
You know.

59:25.442 --> 59:26.436
Are you serious?

59:26.438 --> 59:28.533
Yeah, I am, I'm very fucking serious.

59:28.535 --> 59:30.733
Maybe I'll even become
Secretary of Defense,

59:30.735 --> 59:33.593
and maybe still even
after that, I'll become

59:33.595 --> 59:36.303
fucking president of the
United States of America!

59:36.305 --> 59:38.298
In what world do you live in?

59:39.195 --> 59:41.123
Well, isn't this the
American dream here?

59:41.125 --> 59:43.368
Isn't this what America is all about?

59:43.370 --> 59:44.623
No, it's not.

59:44.625 --> 59:48.233
You told me yourself that it
was about the American Trinity.

59:48.235 --> 59:49.273
Don't you remember?

59:49.275 --> 59:50.393
I sure do.

59:50.395 --> 59:55.098
E Pluribus Unum, Liberty,
Liberty, Liberty and uh...

59:57.185 --> 59:58.533
Liberty and...

59:58.535 --> 59:59.883
You don't remember?

59:59.885 --> 01:00:01.352
Yeah, I do, uh...

01:00:02.085 --> 01:00:03.758
How could you forget?

01:00:06.315 --> 01:00:08.033
It's all over our currency.

01:00:08.035 --> 01:00:08.868
It is?

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.956
Oh, fuck, you know what?

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:12.184
I'm sure you're right.

01:00:12.186 --> 01:00:15.065
You're right, when you're
right, you're right.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.148
There it is.

01:00:20.182 --> 01:00:21.328
Right there.

01:00:23.528 --> 01:00:25.536
And that's exactly what I'm doing.

01:00:30.547 --> 01:00:32.723
You know, I still love you.

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:34.048
But...

01:00:35.185 --> 01:00:38.048
I mean, fuck me, man, look at this mess!

01:00:39.395 --> 01:00:40.846
After everything that happened here,

01:00:40.848 --> 01:00:42.395
I don't know if we can go on.

01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:43.940
You're fucking delusional!

01:00:58.395 --> 01:01:00.319
That's it, that's it, that's it...

01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:01.202
That's it...

01:01:02.586 --> 01:01:03.419
That's it.

01:01:11.176 --> 01:01:12.009
Phew!

01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:02.227
What?

01:03:41.815 --> 01:03:42.648
Fuck!

01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:45.635
Fuck me!

01:05:06.731 --> 01:05:08.394
What are you doing?

01:05:08.396 --> 01:05:09.565
Nothing.

01:05:09.567 --> 01:05:11.917
I'm just chatting online
with a friend of mine.

01:05:13.331 --> 01:05:15.289
Hm, you're funny.

01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:23.434
Emily?

01:06:09.894 --> 01:06:11.035
It's good.

01:06:51.946 --> 01:06:54.263
Ah, fucking motherfucker!

01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:56.223
Fuck!

01:06:56.225 --> 01:06:58.183
God damn it!

01:06:58.185 --> 01:06:59.251
Motherfucker!

01:07:21.895 --> 01:07:23.503
Oh, hi, Kelly, what's up?

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:25.155
Hi, Jason, how are you?

01:07:26.915 --> 01:07:28.964
I'm good, I'm good.

01:07:28.966 --> 01:07:30.523
How are you?

01:07:30.525 --> 01:07:31.370
Good.

01:07:31.372 --> 01:07:32.795
I heard you're back in town.

01:07:32.797 --> 01:07:35.228
I thought we might get
together to have lunch or so?

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:36.236
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:36.238 --> 01:07:37.503
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:07:37.505 --> 01:07:38.522
Sure.

01:07:38.524 --> 01:07:41.243
Seeing as though you're
the preacher's daughter

01:07:41.245 --> 01:07:42.218
and all, you know.

01:07:43.089 --> 01:07:45.193
Yeah, but don't call me that.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.353
Yeah.

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:47.768
Okay, so here it goes:

01:07:49.324 --> 01:07:53.143
Who, uh... Who knows everything about me?

01:07:53.145 --> 01:07:53.995
Google.

01:07:55.225 --> 01:07:56.056
What?

01:07:56.891 --> 01:07:58.143
I'm kidding.

01:07:58.145 --> 01:08:00.448
Only God knows everything about you.

01:08:01.285 --> 01:08:02.768
And yourself, of course.

01:08:03.935 --> 01:08:05.803
Does God know my thoughts?

01:08:05.805 --> 01:08:06.638
Yes.

01:08:07.758 --> 01:08:09.222
And what about the Devil?

01:08:09.224 --> 01:08:10.783
Does he know my thoughts too?

01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:15.463
No, as far as I
know, the scripture doesn't

01:08:15.465 --> 01:08:18.468
say Satan or his demons can
read your mind or thoughts.

01:08:19.505 --> 01:08:21.087
Why do you ask?

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:25.053
I was just curious, that's all.

01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:26.412
What else do you know?

01:08:26.415 --> 01:08:28.803
Satan can't
read your mind, but he

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:32.013
can ascertain the general
flow of your thoughts

01:08:32.015 --> 01:08:35.444
by the words you speak
and the actions you take.

01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:38.212
He can make a well-educated
guess as to what you're

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:41.705
thinking, and then attempts
to use it to his advantage.

01:08:43.571 --> 01:08:45.305
Were you tempted?

01:08:45.313 --> 01:08:47.734
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

01:08:47.737 --> 01:08:48.960
nothing like that.

01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:49.795
I was...

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:52.778
I was just curious, that's all.

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:55.837
Do you speak Arabic by chance?

01:08:56.747 --> 01:08:59.715
No, I only studied
some Latin, but not much.

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:06.263
So you don't know
what means?

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.361
No, I've no idea.

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.738
Who said that to you?

01:09:13.386 --> 01:09:16.609
Oh, it was just some dude
over in Iraq, that's all.

01:09:16.612 --> 01:09:17.919
It's no big deal.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:19.853
Look it up on the Internet.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.002
Yeah, you know what...

01:09:21.005 --> 01:09:23.042
Yeah, yeah, I think I'll do that.

01:09:23.045 --> 01:09:25.219
Say, can I call you back
in a couple of days?

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:28.459
And we'll we'll grab lunch?

01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:30.063
Cool, see you then!

01:09:30.064 --> 01:09:32.106
Okay, cool, you take care.

01:09:48.505 --> 01:09:52.171
The Devil will get you.

01:12:14.235 --> 01:12:15.301
Hey, Jason.

01:12:19.426 --> 01:12:20.952
Where you going, Jason?

01:12:22.655 --> 01:12:24.243
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:12:24.245 --> 01:12:25.616
I'm Pastor Warren.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.258
Pastor Warren?

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:32.043
I'm sorry, how's it that you know my name?

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:36.148
I'm not sure, I just somehow know it.

01:12:38.275 --> 01:12:43.275
Oh, I see, you must be Kelly's
dad, the preacher, right?

01:12:43.785 --> 01:12:44.685
Where you going?

01:12:45.785 --> 01:12:48.333
Oh, I was going camping.

01:12:48.335 --> 01:12:49.893
I see.

01:12:49.895 --> 01:12:51.226
What's in the suitcase?

01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:53.688
Well, camping stuff, what else?

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:58.743
Where's Eric, Monica, and Emily?

01:12:58.745 --> 01:13:01.316
Oh, yeah, they already took
off in the camper a while ago.

01:13:01.318 --> 01:13:03.273
I had to come back to get some extra

01:13:03.275 --> 01:13:05.533
camping gear that we forgot.

01:13:05.535 --> 01:13:06.368
What gear?

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.771
Dude, what's with
all the questions, man?

01:13:11.623 --> 01:13:13.415
I know what's in the suitcases.

01:13:14.315 --> 01:13:16.743
And I know you're not going camping.

01:13:16.745 --> 01:13:17.913
Is that right?

01:13:17.915 --> 01:13:19.893
I even know where you're really going.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:21.845
So where is it that I'm really going?

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:27.865
You're going to prison, Jason,
for a very, very long time.

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:29.743
What?

01:13:29.745 --> 01:13:31.733
Solitary confinement actually.

01:13:31.735 --> 01:13:33.243
What?

01:13:33.245 --> 01:13:35.383
Death row, to be exact.

01:13:35.385 --> 01:13:38.242
Man, what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:13:38.244 --> 01:13:40.410
Do you honestly think
you can get away with all

01:13:40.412 --> 01:13:41.823
that you've done?

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:43.173
Okay, look...

01:13:43.175 --> 01:13:44.543
I'm really busy right now.

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:45.376
I got shit to do.

01:13:45.378 --> 01:13:46.933
I'm already actually running late, so...

01:13:46.935 --> 01:13:50.878
For God's sake, stop denying
what both of us already know.

01:13:52.125 --> 01:13:54.553
To whom did you talk with yesterday?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.103
Who did I talk to yesterday?

01:13:56.105 --> 01:13:58.913
None of your fucking business
is who I talked to yesterday!

01:13:58.915 --> 01:14:02.148
Jason, everything has already happened.

01:14:03.415 --> 01:14:07.463
I just wanna help you to
finally see the truth.

01:14:07.465 --> 01:14:08.923
The real truth.

01:14:08.925 --> 01:14:12.048
Come on, at least tell me who
you talked with yesterday.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:14.826
You know what?

01:14:14.828 --> 01:14:16.658
I'm gonna tell you who
I talked to yesterday.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.606
I talked to a very
evolved being yesterday,

01:14:18.608 --> 01:14:20.553
someone who knew everything about me.

01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:21.386
Okay?

01:14:21.388 --> 01:14:23.723
Someone who showed me the path to God.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.233
That's who I talked to.

01:14:25.235 --> 01:14:26.453
The path to God?

01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:27.605
That's right.

01:14:28.585 --> 01:14:31.703
Did that someone tell
you, by any chance,

01:14:31.705 --> 01:14:35.118
that you could be like God, or Godlike?

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.143
Please, don't tell me
you fell for the oldest

01:14:38.145 --> 01:14:39.228
lie in the book.

01:14:40.065 --> 01:14:40.896
What?

01:14:40.898 --> 01:14:41.731
What lie?

01:14:43.485 --> 01:14:45.048
Satan's first lie.

01:14:46.045 --> 01:14:49.719
Ah, here it is: "Eat of this fruit...

01:14:49.721 --> 01:14:54.359
"And your eyes will be opened,
and you will be like God."

01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.758
Well, you know, I just
listened to my heart.

01:15:00.005 --> 01:15:01.103
Yeah.

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.528
You think your heart is connected

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.055
to something bigger than you?

01:15:04.825 --> 01:15:09.168
Something you may call
spirit, the unconscious,

01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:15.105
your higher-self, the
universe, or even God?

01:15:15.725 --> 01:15:19.173
Yeah, you know, what's wrong with that?

01:15:19.175 --> 01:15:20.743
How could that be wrong?

01:15:20.745 --> 01:15:22.778
Yeah, how could that ever be wrong?

01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:27.503
I can see you were
never exactly a diligent

01:15:27.505 --> 01:15:29.583
student of the word, were you?

01:15:29.585 --> 01:15:32.273
Hey, man, in God we trust, right?

01:15:32.275 --> 01:15:33.138
Exactly.

01:15:35.275 --> 01:15:37.093
So here is what God says.

01:15:37.095 --> 01:15:42.050
Jeremiah 17:9: "The
human heart is the most

01:15:42.052 --> 01:15:46.203
deceitful of all things,
and desperately wicked."

01:15:46.205 --> 01:15:47.788
Hold on. Let me see this.

01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:49.248
Does it really say that?

01:15:50.975 --> 01:15:52.058
It's over, Jason.

01:15:58.807 --> 01:16:01.833
Let me tell you something,
man, nobody can stop me.

01:16:01.835 --> 01:16:04.363
I'm in control, motherfucker, you hear me?

01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:06.093
I'm in charge!

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:06.928
No.

01:16:15.849 --> 01:16:16.905
What the fuck?!

01:16:16.907 --> 01:16:19.533
Jason, you're so hopelessly
delusional you can't

01:16:19.535 --> 01:16:21.642
even see what's in front of you.

01:16:23.985 --> 01:16:25.208
I can see you, man.

01:16:26.445 --> 01:16:27.923
Try to see beyond me.

01:16:31.345 --> 01:16:34.810
Don't you see the police
car, all the cops...

01:16:35.728 --> 01:16:37.711
And all the weapons
that are pointed at you?

01:16:42.929 --> 01:16:43.812
There's no escape.

01:16:46.526 --> 01:16:47.501
It's over.

01:16:48.295 --> 01:16:51.794
There's a small prison
cell waiting for you.

01:16:51.796 --> 01:16:55.293
And in about 10 years, the electric chair.

01:16:57.015 --> 01:16:57.905
No, no, no.

01:16:58.772 --> 01:17:00.214
No, this can't happen.

01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:02.360
Just give up.

01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:03.695
I'll be there for you.

01:17:04.805 --> 01:17:06.619
Nobody can stop me, man.

01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:09.004
No!
