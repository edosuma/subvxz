WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:08.167
Only thing stronger than your craving
for blood is your love for this girl.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.806
Your humanity is killing you.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.561
Turn it off!

00:12.760 --> 00:14.444
- What did you do?
- I fixed him.

00:14.600 --> 00:16.921
Fight for it.
Feel something. Anything, Stefan.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.009
If you don't, you're gonna lose me.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.440
Klaus killed your mother.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.682
He has a hold on you, on me,
on everyone.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.242
He has for a thousand years.
We have to make it stop.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.690
They're looking for Mikael,
the vampire who hunts vampires.

00:29.880 --> 00:31.769
Don't wake him. He will kill you.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.888
Thought you might know
how to kill Klaus.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.122
I can kill Klaus, and I will.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.726
As long as Klaus is alive,
I do what he says.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.645
- Mikael.
- Get Klaus back to Mystic Falls...

00:41.800 --> 00:44.610
and I will gladly drive a stake
through his heart.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.969
Fail, I'll drive it through yours.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.323
Portland is fantastic,
once you get over the whiney music.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.960
It's literally a breeding ground
for werewolves.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.288
Your father's dead.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.880
What did you say to me?

01:06.080 --> 01:10.722
Oh, my mistake.
Not your actual father, and not dead.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.490
Mikael.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.007
Daggered.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.687
What do you want me to do
with the body?

01:19.360 --> 01:23.524
Well, first, I want you to explain to me
exactly what happened.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.086
Let's say Mikael followed Elena. Tried to
grab her so he could use her as bait.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.484
And you, what, Vervained him?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.847
No, we Vervained him.
Guy's an Original.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.082
- We have to make it realistic.
- Okay, fine.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.001
We Vervained him, and in the process
discovered that he had a dagger.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.965
Which he planned to use on Rebekah.
But instead...

01:44.160 --> 01:45.764
We drove it through his heart.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.207
What happens when he asks to see
Mikael's body?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.449
Good point. You have been compelled
to do what Klaus says.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.888
So if the idea is to lure him back here
and kill him...

01:55.040 --> 01:57.884
the last thing we need
is you getting tongue-tied.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.044
Don't look at me.
I'm just in charge of getting him here.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.524
Klaus is smart. If we tell him
that Mikael's dead, he'll want proof.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.722
Then I shall be dead.

02:12.480 --> 02:16.041
- What if he wants to see you in person?
- It means our plan is working.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.409
Klaus will absolutely want
to see my body.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.723
You lure him here, and I will kill him.

02:22.920 --> 02:26.208
With what?
Those daggers won't work on him.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.567
Oh, I am in possession of a stake...

02:28.720 --> 02:31.963
fashioned from the wood
of the ancient white oak tree.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.205
The one that left these ashes
when it burned.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.210
Where is it?

02:37.360 --> 02:38.521
Not here.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.247
Knowing its location
is my insurance policy.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.930
Against what?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.084
You leaving this in my heart.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.323
You see, a vampire can't dagger
an Original without dying.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.570
So it falls to you.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.841
You want me to actually dagger you?

03:01.000 --> 03:04.004
Klaus will leave nothing to chance...

03:04.360 --> 03:06.442
especially when it comes to trust.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.408
I wanna see him.
I want to see his rotting body.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.688
<i>- For myself.
- Well, he's here.</i>

03:19.520 --> 03:20.567
Come by whenever.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.809
If you're lying to me, Stefan,
your compulsion will expose you.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.962
So answer with your life.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.202
Is what you're saying the truth?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.520
<i>It's true.</i>

03:38.640 --> 03:41.530
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- I want to talk to Rebekah.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.770
That's not a problem. She's right here.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.644
<i>- Hello, Nik.
- Rebekah, love.</i>

03:57.840 --> 04:01.481
What's this I hear about Mikael's
tragic run-in with a dagger?

04:05.160 --> 04:06.685
It's true.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.807
He's finally out of our lives for good.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.125
I miss you.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.690
I'm miserable here.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.363
- I'll be home soon.
- Good.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.767
I'll see you then, brother.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.842
He bought it.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.605
He's coming home.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.521
Now, was that easy or what?

04:38.520 --> 04:40.204
Let's just get this over with.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.722
Finally.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.126
Took you long enough.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.407
Rebekah.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.251
Whatever fatherly rubbish
you're thinking, save it.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.767
Nothing you say matters to me.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.130
I see.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.088
- Where's my dagger?
- Elena has it.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.004
Forget your plans to use it on me.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.924
You were never the one I was after.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.406
Nik was my family.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.767
If you were after him,
you were after me.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.208
He blinded you, Rebekah.
He killed your mother.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.128
I know what he did.
And he'll pay for it with his life.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.931
But Nik was not born a killer.
None of us were.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.811
You did this to us
when you turned us into vampires.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.288
You destroyed our family.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.447
<i>Not him.</i>

06:13.640 --> 06:15.642
Rebekah.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.802
I hate everything in my closet.
I have nothing to wear to homecoming.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.486
So don't go.
Let's stay home, order take-out...

06:24.680 --> 06:27.490
and analyze ancient hieroglyphic
thingies with Alaric.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.808
We have to go. Caroline will kill us.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.247
Caroline actually has a date.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.167
You know you can talk to me
about Jeremy, right?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.401
I don't need to.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.450
He fell in love with his ghost girlfriend
and lied about it.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.171
- What's done is done.
- You have to talk about it.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.971
He hurt you, Bonnie.
I'm mad at him too.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.804
You're mad at your little brother.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.850
You'll yell at him a little,
teach him a life lesson...

06:59.000 --> 07:01.287
But you can't really be mad
like I'm mad.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.689
- Bonnie...
- And you shouldn't have to be.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.005
He's your brother.

07:09.480 --> 07:15.203
So, no, I can't really talk to you
about it.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.971
We can't trust Rebekah
not to turn on us.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.360
Oh, really?

07:24.520 --> 07:28.206
Because those Original vampires
are usually so reliable.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.044
Bonnie was right.

07:30.520 --> 07:34.366
Rebekah may be mad at Klaus now,
but he is her brother.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.366
Her lying, mama-killing,
dagger-happy brother.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.641
Wolfsbane's ready.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.007
There are too many things
that can go wrong.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.481
Too many people
that can make it go wrong.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.042
Well, I am formulating
a secret contingency plan.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.043
Really? What is it?

07:50.280 --> 07:52.965
Well, if I told you,
it wouldn't be a secret.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.326
- I need to borrow a tie.
- You have your own ties.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.690
I'm 162 years old
and I'm going to a homecoming dance.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.684
- I need better ties.
- You could not go.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.251
I'm compelled to protect you.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.088
And if I look at your track record
at high-school dances, it's pretty tragic.

08:11.280 --> 08:15.524
My luck, you'll go and get yourself
murdered by the homecoming queen.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.207
- Ah-ah! Nope.
- I know how to do it.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.885
- Alaric taught me.
- Elena...

08:23.040 --> 08:27.284
this thing blows up in our face,
remember, only one of us heals quickly.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.487
Ah...

08:30.200 --> 08:33.885
Please tell me that you have
a better plan than wolfsbane grenades.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.850
Never you mind, brother.
The less you know, the better.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.570
My freedom from Klaus...

08:38.720 --> 08:42.611
rests entirely upon you two
executing your plan perfectly.

08:42.760 --> 08:46.401
So excuse me if I'm a bit cynical.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.404
You're the one that we should be
worried about.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.240
If Klaus asks you one wrong question,
whole thing falls apart.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.610
You do have reason to worry.

08:56.840 --> 09:00.208
But if I look back at our history
of epic plan failures...

09:00.360 --> 09:04.649
it's usually because one of us
let our humanity get in the way.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.646
So if I'm taking odds
on how this thing goes down...

09:08.840 --> 09:12.367
it's certainly not gonna be me
who screws it up.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.646
I'll see you at homecoming.
I can't wait.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.006
Hey, can you hand me the glitter gun?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.165
Please?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.445
Thanks.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.805
Hey, can't we ditch the decorating
and go grab a bite?

09:34.960 --> 09:37.691
Oh, I have a thermos in my bag.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.329
I mean a real bite.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.801
Rebekah knows some people
who like to be fed on.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.531
They're into it.
We don't even have to compel them.

09:45.680 --> 09:49.446
Okay, first of all, I finally almost just
got your mother to stop hating me...

09:49.600 --> 09:51.648
so I probably don't wanna
get caught...

09:51.800 --> 09:54.963
in some weird vampire threesome
with her son.

09:55.120 --> 09:58.329
And, secondly, quit hanging out
with Rebekah, the evil blood slut.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.768
Just keep the claws in tonight
at the dance, okay?

10:01.920 --> 10:03.490
For me?

10:05.160 --> 10:08.130
So who has the misfortune of being
compelled to be her date?

10:08.280 --> 10:09.520
Matt said he'd take her.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.648
Wait, you set her up with Matt?

10:11.800 --> 10:14.280
She wants to go,
he didn't have anyone to go with.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.001
He drinks Vervain, she can't feed on him.
What's the big deal?

10:18.160 --> 10:23.451
The big deal, Tyler, is that Matt
is an innocent, good person...

10:23.640 --> 10:26.564
who should not be going to dances
with evil blood sluts.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.803
Matt's a guy, Caroline.
And Rebekah's hot.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.041
Don't overthink this.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.565
This is a sire thing, isn't it?

10:35.560 --> 10:40.851
Please tell me this is some weird family
extension of your sire bond to Klaus.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.005
I'm here hanging streamers
and have glitter all over my hands.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.521
If I'm sired to anybody, it's you.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.040
Getting a head start, huh?

11:02.360 --> 11:06.251
This is my first high-school dance.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.000
Ever?

11:09.160 --> 11:11.606
I never really had time
for high school before.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.923
Nik and I were always moving around.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.208
Running.

11:18.040 --> 11:20.771
Anyway, I didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.410
Have you heard any more from him?

11:27.560 --> 11:31.610
No, but I'm sure that when he does
return, he'll do it with ï¬‚air.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.124
And Damon and my father are all set
with their plan?

11:36.760 --> 11:37.921
Yes.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.045
Don't tell me.

11:42.280 --> 11:47.923
I don't want to know. I just want to go to
the dance and leave the rest to Mikael.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.760
I know it's really hard.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.644
So thank you for helping us
get Klaus back into town.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.722
Just be careful.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.804
I've been running for a thousand years
for a reason.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.048
Mikael is not a good person.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.969
And he definitely can't be trusted.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.568
No one in my family can.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.731
Are you okay?

12:17.840 --> 12:23.324
I've spent my whole life loving and
hating my brother with equal measure.

12:25.920 --> 12:30.608
I never thought that I'd be the one
to help drive a stake through his heart.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.567
No tears.
I don't want to ruin my makeup.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.328
How do I look?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.684
You look amazing.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.442
But you're missing one thing.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.648
My mother's necklace.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.891
You should wear it tonight.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.003
May I?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.643
Thank you.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.131
I'm so sorry.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.691
I can't leave anything to chance either.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.126
In the back.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.844
Harsh.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.330
It had to be done.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.921
Rebekah was never gonna be
completely on our side.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.366
Hey, I'm not judging you.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.000
It's very Katherine of you.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.811
Not the way to make me feel better
about myself, Damon.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.167
It was a compliment. Sort of.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.970
Stefan is right.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.282
Someone's gonna let their humanity
get in the way and screw this thing up.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.329
And it's probably going to be me.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.130
Elena...

14:22.840 --> 14:26.606
you just daggered somebody.
You're gonna be fine.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.848
Yeah, but I feel bad about it.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.641
I care too much.
That's the problem, Damon.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.691
I'm the weak link.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.810
If it makes you feel any better,
she's not really dead.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.244
Do you trust him?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.369
- Mikael?
- Nope.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.482
- What about Stefan?
- Nope.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.167
Not as long as
he's under Klaus's control.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.324
- Then we need a better plan.
- I know what to do.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.164
You're just not going to like it.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.481
Why not?

14:58.640 --> 15:02.929
Because when this all goes down,
I don't want you having any part of it.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.764
What does that mean?

15:06.520 --> 15:07.646
Do you trust me?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.330
Yes.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.847
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.521
- What happened?
- The gym's flooded.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.683
- The dance is canceled.
- Excuse me?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.207
Well, what are we
supposed to do now?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.209
So does that mean I don't have to go?

15:36.360 --> 15:38.886
You wish. No, Tyler's moving the party
to his house.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.687
Kegs and beer pong for homecoming?
That's different.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.365
Just say you're still coming.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.324
I'll see you there.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.726
Elena.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.609
- Matt, hey.
- Hey.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.047
Um, slight problem
with your homecoming date.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.130
What happened?

15:59.320 --> 16:01.209
How would you feel
about a backup date?

16:19.640 --> 16:23.964
How did he plan
a better party than me so fast?

16:24.760 --> 16:28.242
- Is that a band outside?
- Who are all these people?

16:28.400 --> 16:31.563
This is weird. Where is Tyler?

16:31.760 --> 16:35.765
<i>You wanna freak out?
C'mon!</i>

16:36.120 --> 16:39.761
<i>You wanna freak out?
C'mon!</i>

16:39.920 --> 16:43.402
<i>Yeah</i>

16:43.760 --> 16:45.091
Hey, Stefan. What's up?

16:45.240 --> 16:47.641
Hey, Tyler.
Nice party you got going on here.

16:48.760 --> 16:53.288
Thanks, but I'm not the one throwing it.
I'm just doing what Klaus wants.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.847
What do you mean?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.527
It's not a party, man. It's a wake.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.446
Good evening, everyone.

17:05.119 --> 17:08.806
I wanna thank you all for being here
with me to celebrate.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.446
It's been a long time coming.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.884
So much for homecoming.

17:29.800 --> 17:30.801
This is weird.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.088
Us being here together.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.291
There's Caroline.
She doesn't know anything. Act normal.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.488
- Hey, Klaus is here.
- What?

17:41.680 --> 17:44.490
Our sired hybrid friend, Tyler,
thought it would be okay...

17:44.680 --> 17:46.489
to let his master throw a party.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.607
I expected more surprise.

17:52.320 --> 17:56.006
I've learned not to be surprised
by anything Klaus does.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.808
I'm gonna go find Bonnie.

18:00.640 --> 18:01.687
What's going on?

18:01.840 --> 18:03.683
What are you two doing here
together?

18:03.840 --> 18:06.127
You were supposed to be here
with Rebekah.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.328
Plans changed.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.329
I need a drink.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.845
<i>First light tonight</i>

18:16.840 --> 18:18.763
<i>First light tomorrow</i>

18:21.440 --> 18:25.650
<i>First light this morning
First light this evening</i>

18:25.880 --> 18:27.564
<i>First light tonight</i>

18:30.600 --> 18:33.524
<i>Been looking back</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:36.121
Quite the homecoming.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.601
Been planning my father's funeral
for 1000 years.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.646
In no version of it were these people
invited, but you get the idea.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.883
So, what now? You stop running?

18:46.880 --> 18:50.282
- Now I reunite my family.
- Your family?

18:50.480 --> 18:52.960
You mean the people you cart around
in caskets?

18:53.120 --> 18:56.203
None of that matters anymore.
Mikael's gone.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.890
Bygones will be bygones.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.010
- Really great party.
- I like the band.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.884
Seems the homecoming queen
still walks among the living...

19:05.080 --> 19:08.163
which leads me to believe
Rebekah isn't here. Where is she?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.688
I have no idea.
I thought she was coming with Matt.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.207
Oh, be honest now, Stefan.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.691
Where's my sister?

19:15.880 --> 19:19.089
I said, I have no idea.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.486
Now, would you like me to take you
to your father?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.923
Well, it wouldn't be a party
without the guest of honor, would it?

19:26.080 --> 19:28.560
Bring him to me.

19:31.920 --> 19:35.367
All right.
Perhaps there's something in it for me?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.929
My freedom from your compulsion.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.082
Oh, you want your freedom?

19:41.280 --> 19:45.444
Once he's dead and his weapon
destroyed, you'll have your freedom.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.967
It would be my pleasure
to give it back to you.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.968
Did my daughter go to the dance?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.451
Yep.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.165
You missed the photo op.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.810
- Did you get the stake?
- I did.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.370
I'm not gonna take your word for it.
No offense to your honor.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.170
None taken.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.650
Fancy.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.325
May I?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.767
It's the only weapon
that can kill an Original.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.809
So I think I'll hold on to it.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.769
No offense.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.161
I'd offer you a drink...

20:34.320 --> 20:37.290
but Katherine tells me
you're a vampire-on-the-rocks guy.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.522
Well, technically, you could still offer.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.486
Why feed on vampires?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.808
Don't tell me
it's the smooth aftertaste.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.167
I had a hand in creating vampires...

20:51.320 --> 20:54.164
but the blood lust
was never my intention.

20:54.680 --> 20:58.366
Over the centuries,
I learned to feed from the predator...

20:58.520 --> 20:59.806
not the innocent.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.809
Change of plans.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.849
Klaus is back.
He's at the Lockwoods'...

21:05.040 --> 21:07.884
and he wants your body
delivered to his doorstep.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.884
I'm afraid he's in for
a colossal disappointment.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.684
He's not going to come here.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.367
- Hope your plan didn't depend on that.
- It didn't depend on that.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.844
- But you do have a plan, right?
- Oh, yeah. We got a plan.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.363
It just doesn't involve you.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.169
Couldn't just break his neck?

21:36.360 --> 21:38.727
Well, it certainly occurred to me.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.766
My mom would freak
if she saw all these people here.

21:55.040 --> 21:59.284
Your mother won't be a problem.
I compelled her to go to church.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.881
What are you talking about?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.526
I want you to look around.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.205
There's Bonnie.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.561
There's Elena...

22:10.800 --> 22:12.723
and Matt...

22:12.920 --> 22:15.969
and there's your pretty
little girlfriend, Caroline.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.889
Their dance was wrecked tonight...

22:18.080 --> 22:20.242
and who came through with a party?

22:20.440 --> 22:21.521
You did.

22:22.240 --> 22:24.004
What a pal.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.080
But who are all these
other people here?

22:30.960 --> 22:32.121
I have no idea.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.760
I've never seen
half these people in my life.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.884
That's because I invited
a few dozen friends of my own.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.480
That's my friend Mindy.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.126
I picked her up
along the way in Kansas.

22:46.280 --> 22:51.002
Did you know there's an entire bloodline
of werewolves in the heartland?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.362
There's Tony, from North Dakota...

22:53.640 --> 22:56.041
and let's not forget
the Seattle contingent.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.846
Hold on.
Are those people all hybrids?

22:59.040 --> 23:01.042
And they also love a good party.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.443
They, like you, were sired by me.
They wish to serve their master.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.803
So if anyone should so much as
make a move against me...

23:07.960 --> 23:10.042
they may feel obligated to retaliate.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.007
Feel free to warn your friends.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.403
What are you up to with Klaus?

23:28.240 --> 23:30.527
- Nothing.
- He's onto you, Caroline.

23:30.760 --> 23:34.845
Whatever you all think you're about to
pull off, he's two steps ahead of you.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.441
Okay, I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.161
You're lying to me.

23:40.320 --> 23:44.962
Ha, ha. You know, actually, I'm not.
I don't know anything.

23:45.160 --> 23:48.881
Even if I did, I wouldn't tell you
because you're sired to Team Klaus now.

23:49.040 --> 23:50.280
And you can't be trusted.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.691
So can we please just go back
to the party?

24:04.720 --> 24:08.691
<i>La, Ia, Ia, la
La, la, Ia, Ia, Ia, la</i>

24:14.480 --> 24:16.050
Where's your date?

24:16.200 --> 24:17.725
Getting me a drink.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.531
Seems I have you to thank
for Mikael's demise.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.769
He came at me. I didn't have a choice.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.570
Still, I'm impressed.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.081
It's not easy for a human
to dagger an Original.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.968
- It wasn't the first time.
- Right.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.004
Elijah.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.000
You seem nervous.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.163
I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.647
Well, I'll get straight to the point, then.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.885
People have been after me
for a thousand years.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.560
And I am always one step ahead.

24:53.800 --> 24:57.805
So whatever it is you're thinking
of trying, go for it.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.369
Give it your best shot.
You won't succeed.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.886
Invite only, vampire.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.162
Here's my RSVP.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.569
Hybrid.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.166
What'd you do to her?

25:20.360 --> 25:22.408
It's just Vervain.

25:22.560 --> 25:25.211
She'll be fine.
I need you to get her out of here fast.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.691
What's going on?

25:26.840 --> 25:28.683
Something's going down
against Klaus...

25:29.040 --> 25:32.647
and this house is full of hybrids
that can't let anything happen to him.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.121
- What do you mean, can't?
- I can't explain it.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.089
I can't fight against it.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.170
I just need to protect him
no matter who gets in my way.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.407
By attacking Caroline?

25:41.640 --> 25:43.210
I'm protecting her, Matt.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.089
This is the only way to keep her safe.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.042
Please, just get her out of here safely.
Get everyone out.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.765
Ugh!

26:10.000 --> 26:14.324
As host, you should know these hybrids
don't make the best first impression.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.370
Whatever move you're making,
Klaus is ready for you.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.244
He'll kill anyone if he has to.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.204
Tell someone who cares.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.407
Bonnie!

26:36.080 --> 26:38.401
Bonnie.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.440
The hell's wrong with you?

26:46.640 --> 26:48.768
You're not supposed
to witchy migraine me.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.004
- You weren't supposed to kill Tyler.
- He tried to bite me!

26:53.640 --> 26:56.883
- What is that?
- Nothing.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.804
Oh, my God, is that the...?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.126
<i>They're everywhere.</i>

27:01.200 --> 27:02.645
Why do you have it?

27:02.880 --> 27:05.042
I'm the only one
who can get inside the house!

27:07.560 --> 27:09.722
You have a visitor.

27:09.880 --> 27:13.089
Well, tell my visitor
I'm on the brink of victory here.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.964
He said his name is Mikael.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.681
Then I mustn't keep him waiting.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.565
Move everyone out back.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.491
I'm gonna have a little chat
with my dad.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.931
Tony, you know what to do.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.604
Hello, Niklaus.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.804
Hello, Mikael.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.123
Won't you come in?
Oh, that's right. I forgot, you can't.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.089
Or you can come outside if you want.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.608
Or I could watch my hybrids
tear you limb from limb.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.603
They can't kill me.

28:05.800 --> 28:08.451
True, but it'd make
a hell of a party game.

28:10.440 --> 28:15.321
All I have to do is rub these two fingers
together, and they'll pounce.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.246
The big bad wolf.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.249
You haven't changed.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.842
Still hiding behind your playthings
like a coward.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.444
Oh, and you forget.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.484
They may be sired by you,
but they're still part vampire.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.564
And they can be compelled by me.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.041
Come out and face me, Niklaus...

28:54.480 --> 28:56.209
or she dies.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.483
Go ahead. Kill her.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.047
No. Klaus. He'll do it.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.003
If she dies...

29:05.160 --> 29:07.845
this lot will be the last
of your abominations.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.004
I don't need them.
I just need to be rid of you.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.010
To what end, Niklaus?

29:14.200 --> 29:15.929
So you can live forever...

29:16.160 --> 29:18.049
with no one at your side?

29:18.880 --> 29:21.008
Nobody cares about you
anymore, boy!

29:22.520 --> 29:23.646
Who do you have...

29:23.840 --> 29:28.004
other than those whose loyalty
you've forced?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.361
No one.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.851
No one.

29:35.440 --> 29:40.207
I'm calling your bluff, Father.
Kill her.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.442
Come outside...

29:43.680 --> 29:48.527
and face me, you little coward,
and I won't have to.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.281
My whole life,
you've underestimated me.

29:52.440 --> 29:56.411
If you kill her, you lose your leverage.
So go ahead.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.726
Go on, kill her.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.685
Come on, old man.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.211
Kill her.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.408
Kill her!

30:07.720 --> 30:10.405
Ah... Your impulse, Niklaus.

30:11.960 --> 30:15.931
It has, and will forever be,
the one thing...

30:16.120 --> 30:18.691
that keeps you
from truly being great.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.084
Unh!

30:31.680 --> 30:32.727
Heh, heh.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.287
Katherine.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.286
Ka-boom.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.847
What are you doing?

31:21.960 --> 31:25.009
What the hell did you do?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.409
He's earned his freedom.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.809
Thank you, my friend.

31:45.040 --> 31:48.487
<i>You no longer have to do as I say.
You're free.</i>

32:19.960 --> 32:21.200
Heh.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.208
- Are you okay?
- What do you think?

32:32.360 --> 32:33.725
I'm sorry I stabbed you.

32:34.680 --> 32:36.842
Only thing I could think of
to get you out.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.566
Oh, yeah? Not, "Oh, hey, Caroline.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.200
I'm worried about what might happen
this evening...

32:42.360 --> 32:46.160
<i>so maybe you should go just home
and watch Dancing with the Stars."</i>

32:46.640 --> 32:50.042
If you knew all your friends
were gonna try and take down Klaus...

32:50.200 --> 32:51.406
would you have left?

32:52.880 --> 32:53.927
No.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.044
So there you go. I saved you
from your own stubbornness.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.401
This isn't funny, Tyler.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.164
How am I supposed to be with you
when you're sired to him?

33:02.720 --> 33:05.724
I need you to understand, Caroline.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.046
Understand what?

33:07.200 --> 33:10.682
- That you're one of the bad guys now?
- Understand that this is who I am.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.087
There's nothing I can do about it.

33:13.240 --> 33:17.131
Klaus can't be killed. I can't be fixed.

33:17.280 --> 33:22.047
- Understand that I'm okay with it.
- But how are you okay with it?

33:22.240 --> 33:24.368
Because it's better.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.087
I don't have to turn, Caroline.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.481
Not unless I want to.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.763
I never have to go through
that pain again.

33:37.880 --> 33:41.601
If being sired to Klaus
is the price that I have to pay...

33:42.280 --> 33:43.611
so be it.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.285
But...

33:46.440 --> 33:49.569
you don't have
any true control over yourself...

33:49.720 --> 33:53.486
I never did before.
The full moon controlled me.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.804
After everything
that we've been through...

34:01.760 --> 34:04.525
you've been there for me
through all of it.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.809
Don't turn your back on me now.

34:20.719 --> 34:21.766
Tyler...

34:22.320 --> 34:23.924
Right.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.010
- I just...
- Got it.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.610
- How did this happen?
- We thought of everything, Elena.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.848
Klaus having hybrids,
Mikael turning on us.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.367
We brought in Katherine
so you weren't in danger.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.966
Anything that could've gone wrong,
we were prepared.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.851
I don't understand.
Stefan wanted Klaus dead.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.331
More than anything.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.164
That's what we were counting on.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.806
We blew it.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.325
- Where's Katherine?
- She ran for the hills, like usual.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.966
The minute things got bad.
And who blames her?

35:02.160 --> 35:03.844
Klaus would have crushed her.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.080
I had him, Elena.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.847
I had Klaus.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.530
This could have all been over.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.327
Hey.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.683
Damon, hey. Hey, listen to me.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.291
We'll survive this.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.051
We always survive.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.606
Trust me.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.842
We're never getting Stefan back.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.204
You know that, don't you?

35:35.720 --> 35:37.051
Then we'll let him go.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.004
Okay?

35:42.560 --> 35:44.608
We'll have to let him go.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.364
Not interested in a play-by-play
of our failure, Katherine.

35:58.120 --> 35:59.849
I'm just calling to say goodbye.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.408
I don't know what to tell you.
You had a good plan, Damon.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.881
And that's high praise
coming from me.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.606
That's not very comforting
at the moment.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.125
You going back into hiding?

36:10.360 --> 36:12.601
At least my life's not boring.

36:12.760 --> 36:15.969
<i>- Goodbye, Damon.
- Take care of yourself, Katherine.</i>

36:30.120 --> 36:32.726
He doesn't know
where it all went wrong.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.009
He doesn't need to know.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.281
Are you good from here?

36:46.440 --> 36:51.446
I need to put a million miles between
myself and Klaus as soon as possible.

36:51.640 --> 36:52.687
Stefan.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.490
Stefan.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.129
- Elena.
- Not exactly.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.931
Pep up. We've only got a minute
before they realize I'm not at the party.

37:04.120 --> 37:06.964
- You seem nervous.
- I'm not nervous. I just don't like you.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.885
People have been after me
for a thousand years.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.487
And I am always one step ahead.

37:12.680 --> 37:16.651
So whatever it is you're thinking
of trying, go for it.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.007
Give it your best shot.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.924
You won't succeed.

37:22.160 --> 37:23.685
It won't be for lack of trying.

37:23.960 --> 37:27.806
You'd be smart to tell Damon
to mind his manners tonight.

37:28.320 --> 37:33.042
Because if I die, I've already ensured
that he'll die along with me.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.485
Even in death,
my hybrids have their orders.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.001
So you kill me,
you're killing him too.

37:43.520 --> 37:46.808
How did you know
that I would stop Damon?

37:47.000 --> 37:48.490
I didn't.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.329
I was just hoping
that you would want to.

37:54.040 --> 37:56.850
If Klaus gets killed,
he's taking Damon down with him.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.644
So we pull the plug on the plan.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.241
And face the wrath of Mikael?
We'll all be dead.

38:02.880 --> 38:06.168
Okay, look. I know you've turned off
your humanity and don't care...

38:06.320 --> 38:09.005
- ...so there's only one solution.
- What's that?

38:09.720 --> 38:11.449
Care, Stefan.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.082
Care enough to save Damon's life.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.209
Because I am going back to that party
and I am seeing this through.

38:19.400 --> 38:23.041
Klaus will be killed.
And we'll have our freedom.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.251
But then Damon will be dead.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.242
Your brother will be dead, Stefan.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.367
Unless you care enough
to do something about it.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.965
You've wanted Klaus dead
for 500 years.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.044
Why would you risk all that
just to save Damon's life?

38:44.240 --> 38:47.483
I wasn't just trying to save
Damon's life, Stefan.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.530
I was trying to save yours.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.246
Your humanity.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.405
- Let's just say I like the old you better.
- Aah.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.248
Come on, Katherine.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.444
You don't care about anybody
but yourself. You never have.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.604
You and I both know
that that is not true.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.289
I loved you.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.765
I loved Damon too.

39:14.320 --> 39:17.085
Humanity is a vampire's
greatest weakness.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.331
No matter how easy it is to turn it off...

39:20.560 --> 39:23.928
it just keeps trying
to fight its way back in.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.125
Sometimes I let it.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.651
I can't let it all back in.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.489
I don't want to,
not after everything I've done.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.246
Of course you don't want to.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.761
But if you don't let yourself feel...

39:44.920 --> 39:47.491
you won't be able to do
what I need you to do next.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.806
What's that?

39:50.080 --> 39:51.650
<i>Get mad.</i>

40:03.840 --> 40:05.649
Rebekah, where are you?

40:05.840 --> 40:08.002
Pick up the phone, darling.
Daddy's dead.

40:08.160 --> 40:09.844
It's time for a family reunion.

40:11.440 --> 40:13.886
Stefan. Miss me already?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.282
I'm calling to thank you
for my freedom.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.802
Well, I like to believe
I'm a man of my word, more or less.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.203
The thing is,
it came at too high of a price.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.842
You took everything from me, Klaus.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.651
Let bygones be bygones.
Trust me...

40:29.840 --> 40:31.683
<i>resentment gets old.</i>

40:31.840 --> 40:33.683
You know what never gets old?

40:36.600 --> 40:37.840
Revenge.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.600
No.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.370
What's the matter, Klaus?

40:43.600 --> 40:45.489
Missing something?

40:45.680 --> 40:47.045
What are you doing?

40:47.200 --> 40:49.931
I'm just enjoying my freedom.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.881
I will kill you
and everyone you've ever met.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.886
You do that,
and you'll never see your family again.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.089
I wonder, Klaus...

41:01.240 --> 41:05.723
as someone who's been one step
ahead for a thousand years...

41:05.880 --> 41:08.565
were you prepared for this?
