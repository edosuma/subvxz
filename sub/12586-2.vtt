00:31.740 --> 00:33.742


00:36.202 --> 00:37.245


00:37.328 --> 00:39.706
When is Principal Moss gonna wrap it up?

00:39.789 --> 00:43.334
I'm useless until I've had my second soda
of the day.

00:43.418 --> 00:47.422
Yeah, I know. Oh, and by the way,
I can't eat with you today.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.549
I'm studying with Russ during lunch.

00:49.632 --> 00:53.094
Again? What could you possibly
be studying?

00:53.178 --> 00:56.097
Mainly him. He's brilliant.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.141
But he's got the good looks
of someone much dumber.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.601


01:01.144 --> 01:03.563
So what are you thirsty for, Bobby?
Cherry cola?

01:03.646 --> 01:05.857
I need something dignified.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.402
What do you have in the Mister
or Doctor variety?

01:11.112 --> 01:12.322


01:13.323 --> 01:14.157


01:14.240 --> 01:15.450
Lift with your legs, Emily.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.785


01:20.205 --> 01:22.165
I can't believe we have to sell sodas

01:22.248 --> 01:24.501
to pay for our educational conference
this year.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.836
Well, thanks to those vending machines,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.380
we're 200 dollars closer to Cancun!

01:33.218 --> 01:36.262
At this rate, we can make the trip
all inclusive!

01:36.346 --> 01:38.431
-All right!
Yeah!

01:40.016 --> 01:44.229
In a perfect world, I'd have longer arms
so I could shave my back.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.357
In a perfect world,
you'd have no back hair.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.193
Hank, that was unfathomably deep.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.571
We should start a quote notebook,
so we remember all these gems.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.282
Yeah, man.
Dang ol', talking about that time...

01:56.366 --> 01:57.534
Boomhauer, not yet!

01:57.617 --> 01:58.952
Save it for the book!

02:01.246 --> 02:03.540
It seems like everybody's pairing up.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.667
What happened to keeping it casual?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.211
Yeah. And everybody's always making out.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.172
And then I'm late for class
because I'm always watching.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.507
Hi, Joseph.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.801
Oh, yeah. I have a girlfriend too.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.761
What?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.474
<i>Hey there, Landry Longhorns,</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:24.185
<i>if you haven't yet experienced</i>
<i>the</i><i>refreshing</i><i>taste</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:29.232
<i>of an ice cold soda today, why not</i><i>stop</i>
<i>by</i><i>one of our</i><i>six</i><i>new</i><i>machines?</i>

02:29.315 --> 02:30.150
<i>I just did.</i>

02:31.901 --> 02:33.111
<i>Aah...</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:48.334
I'm so bored.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.211
Bobby, why aren't you playing video games?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.212
Eeh.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.716
Or why don't you go over
and hang out with your friends?

02:54.799 --> 02:58.928
Because Joseph and Connie
and everyone else I know has a date!

02:59.762 --> 03:01.097
I want a date!

03:01.181 --> 03:04.058
Bobby, if you want to meet a girl,
you have to do the work.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.894
Find out what she's interested in.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.729
If you're lucky, it'll be sports.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.023
Interests, huh?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.363
Hello, ladies.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.616
I noticed you ordered the pizza.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.704
Are you, uh, interested in pizza?

03:34.047 --> 03:34.881
Pfft.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.175
At least you're always here for me.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.516
Aah.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.644
I have no one else to sit with.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.689
All my friends are dating but me.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.776
What's wrong with me?

03:54.859 --> 03:56.361
Don't blame yourself, Bobby.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.487
Blame that soda.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.280
What are you talking about?

03:59.364 --> 04:03.910
Last night on TV, they said a cartel
of industrial corn farmers

04:03.993 --> 04:07.038
is putting high-fructose corn syrup
into all our food!

04:07.121 --> 04:08.873
And soda is the worst!

04:08.957 --> 04:11.668
Yeah, it's making us all fat
and have bad skin.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.503
We're all in their death grip.

04:20.551 --> 04:22.345
Oh, my God!

04:22.428 --> 04:24.764
This explains everything!

04:24.847 --> 04:26.849
If it wasn't for this soda,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.059
I'd be thinner!

04:28.142 --> 04:30.645
Maybe even more handsome!

04:30.728 --> 04:33.273
Maybe I'd have a girlfriend!

04:38.194 --> 04:40.280
So, Cancun, huh?

04:40.363 --> 04:42.657
Boy, do I wish I was still a teacher!

04:42.740 --> 04:45.368
School board retreats are so boring.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.162
Do you remember the Acapulco retreat
in '96?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.873
I remember driving to the airport.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.795
Dangit! This is all because of you!

04:55.878 --> 04:58.464
You're the reason I'm fat and lonely!

04:58.548 --> 05:01.009
Make your purchase and move on, booby!

05:01.092 --> 05:03.303
Don't you think if I could move on,
I would?

05:03.386 --> 05:05.013
This machine's got me!

05:05.096 --> 05:06.597
It's got all of us!

05:07.598 --> 05:10.518
I used to be thinner and more mellow!

05:10.601 --> 05:11.811
But I can't help myself!

05:13.187 --> 05:15.023
Look at me! I'm buying...

05:15.148 --> 05:16.316
...a soda right now!

05:16.399 --> 05:17.567
Bobby's going crazy!

05:17.650 --> 05:19.235
-What's happening?
-When was he thin?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.281
-Come on, get those out of here!
-You tell him, Bobby!

05:23.364 --> 05:25.241
All right, kids. Back to your tables.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.328
Principal Moss, you have to help!

05:28.411 --> 05:30.872
Take these soda machines
out of this school!

05:30.955 --> 05:32.290
They're ruining us!

05:32.373 --> 05:33.374
That's enough, Bobby!

05:33.458 --> 05:35.460
I can't avoid them. They're everywhere.

05:35.543 --> 05:40.131
Every time one breaks down,
two more pop up in its place!

05:40.214 --> 05:42.342
How many machines do you have, Carl?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.178
Go on, kids. Get back to class.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.016
This isn't over!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.269
Why are you looking at me that way, Steve?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.439
Carl, I wish I hadn't seen
what just happened here.

05:56.522 --> 05:57.523
But I did see it.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.401
And more importantly,
I was seen seeing it.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.654
Obesity is the new hot button issue.
They got to go.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.409
Okay.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.787
Somebody say something immortal.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.000
Well, I was at the grocery store
yesterday.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.085
Ooh.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.503
This is gonna be good.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.588
You say great things to clerks.

06:20.671 --> 06:21.589
Continue.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.550
Well, I told the cashier,
“Usually I give a penny.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.469
But today, I'm gonna take a penny.”

06:28.513 --> 06:31.182
Huh. Okay. Just gonna get rid of that.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.859
Be strong. Keep moving.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.154
Oh, I got to have one!

06:52.412 --> 06:54.997
Hey, they're taking them out!

06:55.081 --> 06:55.998
Really?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.959
What's happening?

06:58.042 --> 07:01.754
I don't like it when I don't know
what's happening.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.132
Bobby told Principal Moss
the machines were killing us

07:04.215 --> 07:05.800
and to get rid of them, and they did!

07:05.883 --> 07:07.385
Bobby did it for all of us!

07:07.468 --> 07:08.886
-Great!
-Way to go!

07:09.929 --> 07:10.805
Cool.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.559
-Huh.
-You really made a difference today.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.561
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows about it!

07:16.644 --> 07:18.896
You're my next article
for the school paper!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.774
So why'd you do it?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.068
-I don't know.
-I think I do.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.820
It's because you care.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.573
I guess I do.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.287
So, uh, is that something
you're interested in?

07:34.370 --> 07:36.164
People who care?

07:36.247 --> 07:39.083
Well, yeah! It's, like, everything to me!

07:39.167 --> 07:40.710
I mean, if more kids cared,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.170
there'd be no war!

07:43.838 --> 07:45.465
Caring is good!

07:45.548 --> 07:46.924
There, I said it.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.469
I don't care if it angers people!

07:53.723 --> 07:55.892
Now, if you walk with me to class,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.478
I'll tell you what I think
about mean people.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.112
Remember that one time
we had breakfast for dinner?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.739
Never again.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.574
Guess what happened to me today?

08:11.657 --> 08:14.577
I got interviewed for the school paper

08:14.660 --> 08:16.370
by a cute girl.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.997
Well, good for you, Bobby.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.000
Yeah! She was really impressed
that I got the soda machines

08:21.083 --> 08:22.835
taken out of the school.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.378
You got them taken out?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.630
Well, all right!

08:25.713 --> 08:28.508
You must have written one heck of a letter
to the school board!

08:28.591 --> 08:30.426
No. I was just yelling about them.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.386
And then some other kids joined in.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.763
And they started yelling.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.058
Before I knew it, the machines were gone.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.520
Dear Lord, it sounds like
you were protesting!

08:40.603 --> 08:42.021
I don't know what you call it.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.857
But Olivia sure found it interesting.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.319
Bobby, protesting is a last resort after

08:48.402 --> 08:50.738
all proper channels have been exhausted.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.741
Unless, of course,
you're the French or movie stars

08:53.824 --> 08:56.536
who have fallen on hard times
and need attention.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.453
It's true.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.081
I noticed George Clooney
became very political

09:00.164 --> 09:02.458
after his Gong Show movie bombed.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.045
Bobby, do you want to end up
like George Clooney?

09:10.716 --> 09:12.218
Mmm. No.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.310
Hi, Olivia.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.145
I liked your article.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.565
It totally captured what I'm all about.

09:25.648 --> 09:29.735
And it really helps the cause
and/or movement.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.779
Che Guevara would be proud.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.031
You're both such men of passion.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.449
You're right.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.244
And you know what else
I'm passionate about?

09:38.327 --> 09:39.912
Going to a movie,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.999
this Friday, with you.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.417
There's no time, Bobby!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.711
The soda-machine incident really woke
people up!

09:46.794 --> 09:48.337
There's just so much to do!

09:51.132 --> 09:52.842
You care about me.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.262
The deposit for the hotel is due
in three days.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.680
And we still don't have the money.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.223
It's all because of that Bobby Hill!

09:59.307 --> 10:02.059
I can't return my bathing suit
in good conscience.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.520
I've already tried it on
without underwear.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.898
You know, Debbie...
We have a lot in common.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.693
Guess why I can't return these pants.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.195
Good news, people.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.197
I just found the answer
to our revenue problem.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.284
It's an electronic news ticker.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.953
How is that gonna work?
You can't put change in there!

10:21.037 --> 10:22.288
-I don't see how...
-Put your coffee down

10:22.371 --> 10:23.539
and get a hold of yourself.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.666
The ad company pays us to put it up.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.462
And all we have to do is let them promote
their new energy bars on it.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.381
Folks, the trip's back on!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.800
Thank goodness!

10:38.721 --> 10:39.680
What?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.807
-Did you say something?
-No.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.022
So in addition to my editorials,

10:48.105 --> 10:50.650
I'm thinking we should start circulating
a few petitions.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.027
One to stop the polar ice caps
from melting.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.987
And one to stop the Middle East.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.155
Okay.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.657
Hey, what is that?

10:57.740 --> 10:59.575
Yeah. Check it out.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.662
Wow, Bobby!
She sure talks a lot about stuff.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.914
-Are you scoring yet?
-No!

11:04.997 --> 11:07.500
She's too busy trying to save the world!

11:07.583 --> 11:10.086
Cut her loose, dude. She's a handful.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.921
Bobby, come look at this.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.297
Can you believe this?

11:13.381 --> 11:16.759
All those tickers do is show ads
for those stupid energy bars.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.886
Most of them have more sugar than a soda.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.137
Oh, boy.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.889
See, my dad is a professor.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.892
And his girlfriend says that all we're
being taught in school is consumption

11:24.975 --> 11:25.976
and commercialism.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.437
And she should know.
She's his best student.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.438
Okay.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.525
Let's just say I get rid of this ticker,

11:32.608 --> 11:34.360
would you then feel like you could,

11:34.443 --> 11:39.323
you know, celebrate this victory
by going to a movie?

11:39.407 --> 11:40.741
Sure, I'd go to a movie.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.326
But it has to be a documentary.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
I'm on it!

11:45.287 --> 11:48.749
I've, uh, drawn up some
possible sleeping arrangements.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.711
Now, these can all change mid-trip
if necessary.

11:51.794 --> 11:52.670
Good news.

11:52.753 --> 11:56.006
The tour operators say that alcohol
is permitted on the hang glider.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.091
Yeah!

11:57.174 --> 12:01.178
Excuse me, teachers and Principal Moss.

12:01.262 --> 12:07.685
On behalf of the students of Tom Landry,
I demand you remove the tickers!

12:09.895 --> 12:13.774
I am the kid who cares.
And I am here to say no to tickers!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.609
No to commercialism!

12:15.693 --> 12:17.945
No to "consumptionalinism."

12:20.239 --> 12:21.699
Everybody relax.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.075
Carl's got this covered.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.371
-Bobby, let's talk frankly.
-No.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.416
This ain't about those tickers, is it?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.919
It's about impressing that little girl
out there.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.548
I don't know what to do!

12:37.631 --> 12:40.176
I finally have a girl interested in me!

12:40.259 --> 12:43.137
But it's just because I got rid of those
soda machines.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.680
I got to keep it going!

12:44.764 --> 12:45.931
I hear you, Bobby.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.516
I was a chubby kid.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.685
I even joined the Peace Corps
to get girls.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.188
But all the girls of the village
liked Olunga!

12:52.271 --> 12:56.317
He was seven feet tall,
could run for miles, played the guitar.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.154
I'm digging wells and giving vaccines,
and Olunga would swoop in

13:00.237 --> 13:03.199
with a love song
and a handful of fried grasshoppers.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.952
What you need to do is romance this girl.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.704
Fine. But how?

13:10.206 --> 13:11.332
With a dance!

13:13.918 --> 13:14.835
How'd it go?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.837
Well, the tickers aren't going anywhere.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.424
But, we're having a dance!

13:22.676 --> 13:24.136
You can pick the theme.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.184
It can be depressing.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.186
Bobby, I thought you cared.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.562
I thought you were radical.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.357
I was even thinking about giving you
my school jacket.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.984
That's right.
A girl giving a jacket to a guy.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.986
We would have blown their minds!

13:44.448 --> 13:45.407
No deal!

13:45.491 --> 13:47.785
If you don't get rid of those tickers,

13:47.868 --> 13:53.207
I'm gonna have to escalate this protest
to the next level of escalation!

13:53.290 --> 13:55.042
Like what? A student walkout?

13:55.125 --> 13:58.254
If you even try to walk out,
you little twerp...

13:58.337 --> 13:59.755
It's not up to me.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.799
It's up to all of you.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.467
So are the tickers in

14:03.551 --> 14:04.718
or out?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.431
Walk out!

14:09.515 --> 14:12.351
Oh, my God!
Bobby, are you leading a walkout?

14:12.434 --> 14:15.396
That's right! People, we're outta here!

14:15.479 --> 14:19.775
Walk out! Walk out!
Walk out! Walk out!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.903
Walk out! Walk out! Walk out!

14:22.987 --> 14:27.491
Walk out! Walk out!
Walk out! Walk out!

14:32.204 --> 14:34.123
Moss tried to bribe me!

14:34.206 --> 14:37.376
And to that I say shame!

14:37.459 --> 14:41.046
I could have sold you all out
for my own gain.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.548
But I did not!

14:42.631 --> 14:45.551
-Do you know why?
-Because you care!

14:45.634 --> 14:47.344
Because I what?

14:47.428 --> 14:48.971
Because you care!

14:50.139 --> 14:53.309
-What are we going to do now, Bobby?
-We're walking out!

14:54.602 --> 14:56.228
We already did that.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.188
Oh!

14:58.272 --> 15:00.149
What are we gonna do next?

15:00.816 --> 15:03.402
What do you think we're gonna do next?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.865
I think we're gonna march into town!

15:07.948 --> 15:09.950
-Yeah!
-To town, I say!

15:10.034 --> 15:12.202
Revolution!

15:13.454 --> 15:17.333
The kids united will never be divided!

15:17.416 --> 15:21.128
The kids united
will never be divided!

15:21.211 --> 15:24.965
The kids united will never be divided!

15:25.049 --> 15:30.596
-The kids united will never be divided!
-Yeah, they've finally come to kill us.

15:30.679 --> 15:34.975
Oh, well, I liked it when we could just
stick them in factories.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.896
The kids united
will never be divided!

15:38.979 --> 15:43.400
The kids united will never be divided!

15:43.484 --> 15:48.822
The kids united will never be divided!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.577
Take it all down, man!

15:53.661 --> 15:55.829
Maybe we should take you down!

15:55.913 --> 15:57.247
Yeah!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.168
Come on!

16:03.545 --> 16:05.547
Guys, we can't do this!

16:05.631 --> 16:08.050
It's just looting and random violence!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.636
That's not what this protest is about!

16:10.719 --> 16:12.930
-Right, Olivia?
-Bobby's right!

16:13.013 --> 16:17.518
Although if we burned down city hall,
it would send a powerful message!

16:17.601 --> 16:18.560
Mm-hm.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.812
What?

16:19.895 --> 16:22.356
Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby. You're leading us.

16:22.439 --> 16:24.024
You tell us what to burn down.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.150
Nothing!

16:25.234 --> 16:27.444
We're not gonna burn anything down!

16:27.528 --> 16:30.155
Is that the message we want to send?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.365
Yeah! Yes!

16:31.907 --> 16:34.368
Well, uh, okay then.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.251
Follow that truck!

16:43.127 --> 16:45.212
Come on!

16:54.513 --> 16:55.889
Goddang! Man, I can't take it!

16:55.973 --> 16:57.975
Man, I don't want dang old,
coming out with ol' quotes, man!

16:58.058 --> 16:59.727
That's talking about too much pressure,
man!

16:59.810 --> 17:02.146
I just want to come down
from my dang ol' day, man!

17:06.942 --> 17:07.818
Come on!

17:07.901 --> 17:09.153
Whoo!

17:09.236 --> 17:11.071
Dear lord! Truants!

17:14.199 --> 17:15.034
Dad!

17:15.743 --> 17:16.660
Bobby?

17:21.248 --> 17:22.458
Start talking!

17:22.541 --> 17:24.793
Things just got crazy so fast!

17:24.877 --> 17:28.297
I was arguing with Principal Moss
about some ticker thing.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.883
And before I knew it, someone said,
“walk out!”

17:30.966 --> 17:33.969
And then I said, “Okay.”
And then we were outside!

17:34.053 --> 17:35.971
You're protesting again, aren't you?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.140
Yes. But I don't really mean it.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.392
Bobby, I thought we were clear on this.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.729
But you said to find out what girls
are interested in.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.732
And this is what she's interested in.

17:46.815 --> 17:49.193
Well, then maybe she's not the girl
for you.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.444
I know that now.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.072
She wants to burn down city hall!

17:53.155 --> 17:54.698
And you brought them here?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.366
Whoo!

17:56.450 --> 17:58.494
I just want this to go away, Dad.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.957
All right. I tell you what,
I'll help you make this go away.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.709
But that doesn't mean you're off the hook.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.003
We'll discuss punishment later.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.254
Okay.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
-Yeah!
-All right!

18:10.589 --> 18:11.924
-All right.
-Yeah!

18:12.007 --> 18:13.383
All right, everyone. Listen up.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.011
-We want a plane to Disneyworld!
-Yeah!

18:16.095 --> 18:17.805
And one hundred hamburgers!

18:17.888 --> 18:20.432
And we're not leaving
until our demands are met!

18:20.516 --> 18:23.185
Relax, kids.
I'm not here to tell you to go home.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.686
I'm on your side.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.355
-All right! Yeah!
-Yeah! Yes!

18:26.438 --> 18:29.775
Now, for a great cause like this,
you need to be prepared.

18:31.777 --> 18:36.031
Now, when the cops come, they're probably
gonna shoot the high-powered hoses at you.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.534
If you don't want them
to knock you down the street,

18:38.617 --> 18:42.621
the best thing to do is tie yourselves
to trees or poles.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.374
-What?
-That doesn't sound fun.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.458
Oh, it's not.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.127
Especially if they have dogs.

18:49.169 --> 18:52.339
And then when they arrest you,
make sure they know you're a juvenile.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.467
That way they can only keep you in jail
until you're 21.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.885
-Okay...
-And about jail,

18:56.969 --> 19:00.848
the good news is they have a library
so you can still go to school.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.648
Tell me more about jail.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.817
Just go home, son.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.572
I can't believe everybody bailed.

19:17.072 --> 19:21.118
You know, Principal Moss can't put up more
news tickers if he's in the hospital.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.244
Right, Bobby?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.121
Ehh.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.624
Olivia, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.751
See, you're crazy.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.337
Bobby, I thought you had passion!

19:32.421 --> 19:34.923
Hey, dude. I got all kinds of passion.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.638
Well, there she goes.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.558
That was a bumpy ride.

19:44.641 --> 19:45.559
Geez!

19:46.476 --> 19:50.647
Hey, Dad, how did you know what was gonna
happen with the protest anyway?

19:50.731 --> 19:54.359
Well, when I was your age,
I went to protests all the time.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.778
But I thought you hated protests.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.614
Yeah. But my dad loved them.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.575
Cotton used to take me to watch
the hippies get beaten up

20:01.658 --> 20:03.285
and shot with water cannons.

20:03.994 --> 20:06.038
Boy, I never saw him happier!

20:06.121 --> 20:07.789
He'd set up lawn chairs

20:07.873 --> 20:10.375
and a big cooler stocked with cold drinks.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.381
Now, finish cleaning up
so you can get back to the school

20:16.465 --> 20:18.300
and apologize to your teachers.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.721
Hey, Bobby.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.598
Do you need any help?

20:25.307 --> 20:27.726
Oh, Shelley. Sure.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.189
I kind of liked those energy bars.

20:32.272 --> 20:35.108
I don't think I could have made it
the last two miles without one.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.152
But I guess they're still wrong.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.487
Yeah.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.448
Maybe we should write a letter
to get rid of them.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.408
Or start a petition.

20:43.492 --> 20:49.122
Or maybe we could just go to the movies
and forget about all that stuff.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.707
I like movies.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.802
Woo-hoo!

21:05.305 --> 21:06.765
Look at him!

21:08.767 --> 21:09.935
You go get him!

21:11.853 --> 21:12.729
Mmm.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.564
I'm okay!

21:52.185 --> 21:54.771
-<i>Do you want to end up
like George Clooney?</i>
