LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:02.461 --> 00:04.546
<i>Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:06.173
<i>Let's dive right in, shall we?</i>

00:04.546 --> 00:06.173
<i>So Jane was married to Michael,</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:07.758
<i>and friends</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:07.758
<i>with her baby daddy Rafael.</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:09.259
<i>Although, the terms</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:09.259
<i>of that relationship</i>

00:09.259 --> 00:10.552
<i>had recently changed.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:12.095
I'm finally over you.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.014
Oh, and now...

00:12.095 --> 00:14.014
I'm kind of like,

00:14.014 --> 00:15.641
"Oh, so what if

00:14.014 --> 00:15.641
Jane's upset?"

00:15.641 --> 00:17.643
<i>Yeah. So that made life</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:17.643
<i>more difficult.</i>

00:17.643 --> 00:18.894
<i>On the bright side,</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:20.479
<i>Jane had recently gotten</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:20.479
<i>in touch</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:21.939
<i>with her fabulous cousin</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:21.939
<i>Catalina.</i>

00:21.939 --> 00:24.023
JANE:

00:21.939 --> 00:24.023
<i>She's incredible, Michael.</i>

00:24.023 --> 00:25.818
After Oxford, I met

00:24.023 --> 00:25.818
this guy in a rock band

00:25.818 --> 00:27.194
and followed him to Paris.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.654
We broke up within days,

00:27.194 --> 00:28.654
but I decided to stay

00:28.654 --> 00:30.280
and take culinary classes,

00:30.280 --> 00:32.407
which is when I studied under

00:30.280 --> 00:32.407
Ludo before living in Berlin.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.117
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

00:32.407 --> 00:34.117
<i>In fact, Jane liked her so much</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:36.036
<i>she invited Cat to stay</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:36.036
<i>with them in their new place.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:39.665
<i>And things were going great,</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:39.665
<i>until this happened.</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:40.875
JANE: This is my

00:39.665 --> 00:40.875
cousin Catalina.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.501
<i>Yup, they hit it off.</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:44.378
<i>And hey, personally,</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:44.378
<i>I'm like,</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:46.213
<i>you're Jane's cousin,</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:46.213
<i>find a different guy.</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:47.840
<i>But they seemed to really like</i>

00:46.213 --> 00:47.840
<i>each other,</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:49.216
<i>so who am I to judge?</i>

00:49.216 --> 00:50.467
<i>And speaking of judging,</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:52.636
<i>Xo ran into</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:52.636
<i>her old flame Bruce,</i>

00:52.636 --> 00:54.179
<i>who Jane hated.</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:55.973
He was married,

00:54.179 --> 00:55.973
and he didn't tell Mom.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.725
That was a different time

00:55.973 --> 00:57.725
in my life.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.977
I can't even imagine

00:57.725 --> 00:59.977
being with Bruce now.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.269
<i>But then this happened.</i>

01:01.269 --> 01:03.313
<i>And Rogelio saw! I know!</i>

01:03.313 --> 01:05.566
<i>Yikes! And speaking of yikes...</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:07.693
<i>Rafael's mother was</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:07.693
<i>the crime lord Mutter,</i>

01:07.693 --> 01:09.319
<i>and she was murdered.</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:10.696
<i>But she left a clue,</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:12.239
<i>which led to a secret</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:12.239
<i>bank account,</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.991
<i>which the police</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:13.991
<i>were trying to track.</i>

01:13.991 --> 01:16.243
So we have 12 numbers.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.243
Bank accounts have 12 numbers.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.661
<i>And, man, Michael really wanted</i>

01:17.661 --> 01:19.705
<i>to get back</i>

01:17.661 --> 01:19.705
<i>to being a detective.</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:21.749
Hey, you're looking better.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.749
Oh, let's hope the doctor

01:21.749 --> 01:23.709
agrees with you--

01:21.749 --> 01:23.709
I just had my physical.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.502
<i>Yup. He can't yet,</i>

01:23.709 --> 01:25.502
<i>because of his</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.212
<i>getting shot in the chest</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:27.212
<i>and all.</i>

01:27.212 --> 01:30.215
<i>Good news: he was getting</i>

01:27.212 --> 01:30.215
<i>stronger every day,</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:31.926
<i>and settling in</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:31.926
<i>to married life with Jane,</i>

01:31.926 --> 01:34.595
<i>which is where we left off.</i>

01:36.055 --> 01:38.390
<i>You'll recall,</i>

01:36.055 --> 01:38.390
<i>when Catalina Maria Mora</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:42.561
<i>first came into Jane's life,</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:42.561
<i>well, it felt like a dream.</i>

01:42.561 --> 01:45.230
<i>But alas,</i>

01:42.561 --> 01:45.230
<i>the thing with dreams is,</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:47.232
<i>eventually you wake up.</i>

01:47.232 --> 01:50.652
( Catalina laughing

01:47.232 --> 01:50.652
and talking loudly )

01:50.652 --> 01:52.821
Just tell her to be quiet.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.821
She's gonna wake...

01:52.821 --> 01:54.364
( Mateo crying )

01:54.364 --> 01:55.908
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

01:54.364 --> 01:55.908
<i>Too late.</i>

01:55.908 --> 01:57.659
( continues crying )

01:55.908 --> 01:57.659
Shh...

01:57.659 --> 01:59.703
( whispers ):

01:57.659 --> 01:59.703
We have to get rid of her.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.580
<i>I should explain.</i>

01:59.703 --> 02:01.580
<i>Catalina's one-night layover</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:04.416
<i>had turned into</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:04.416
<i>a two-week layover,</i>

02:04.416 --> 02:06.043
<i>and counting.</i>

02:04.416 --> 02:06.043
Four more days.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.669
It's just four more days.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.129
I saw her book

02:07.669 --> 02:09.129
the plane ticket.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.506
It's the teething.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.506
I know. That's why

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
it's a miracle he was

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
actually sleeping.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.052
( Catalina laughing )

02:13.174 --> 02:15.052
Whoever she's speaking to

02:15.052 --> 02:17.137
must be a bloody riot.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.313
<i>Oh, man. It's been a while</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:29.066
<i>since high school French--</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:29.066
<i>I think maybe she's talking</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:31.819
<i>about a hair stylist</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:31.819
<i>that does great highlights.</i>

02:31.819 --> 02:33.904
<i>Or having coffee at the ballet.</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:35.238
Hey. Psst.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.782
Do you mind keeping it down?

02:36.782 --> 02:39.576
Oh.<i> Je suis tres--</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:39.576
I mean, I'm so sorry.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.620
I came out here 'cause

02:39.576 --> 02:41.620
I didn't want to wake you.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.374
CATALINA ( laughing ):

02:43.371 --> 02:46.374
Oh, Igor!

02:46.374 --> 02:48.794
CATALINA: That was actually

02:46.374 --> 02:48.794
my friend Igor calling

02:48.794 --> 02:50.629
from the bathroom

02:48.794 --> 02:50.629
at the Isabel Marant show.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.965
<i>Blah, blah, blah. We get it.</i>

02:50.629 --> 02:52.965
It's apparently chaos.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.342
<i>You go to fabulous places</i>

02:52.965 --> 02:55.342
<i>and know fabulous people.</i>

02:55.342 --> 02:57.260
Can I get a teething biscuit?

02:57.260 --> 02:59.638
My finger's feeling

02:57.260 --> 02:59.638
pretty abused right now.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.306
I can't find them.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.306
Catalina!

03:02.641 --> 03:04.018
Those are Mateo's

03:02.641 --> 03:04.018
teething biscuits.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.184
Shut up!

03:05.184 --> 03:06.603
( chuckles )

03:05.184 --> 03:06.603
Well, every bit

03:06.603 --> 03:08.939
as good as the biscotti

03:06.603 --> 03:08.939
at La Bella Ferrara.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.440
( laughing ):

03:08.939 --> 03:10.440
So sorry!

03:10.440 --> 03:12.943
<i>Inhala, exhala, Jane.</i>

03:12.943 --> 03:15.863
<i>Remember, just four more days.</i>

XIOMARA:

03:18.532 --> 03:20.742
<i>She's still here?</i>

03:20.742 --> 03:22.452
Yup. Apparently,

03:20.742 --> 03:22.452
she and Raf are...

03:22.452 --> 03:24.538
( imitating Catalina ):

03:22.452 --> 03:24.538
...getting on so well--

03:24.538 --> 03:25.831
plus, she wants to be

03:24.538 --> 03:25.831
great mates with me.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.499
I don't know

03:25.831 --> 03:27.499
how you can stand her.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
Just the other day

03:27.499 --> 03:29.668
I was telling Gloria Estefan

03:29.668 --> 03:31.461
what a shameless namedropper

03:29.668 --> 03:31.461
Catalina is.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.672
Did you tell Oprah too?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.672
No, just Gayle.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
XIOMARA:

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
How's Michael holding up?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.385
Better than I am.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.385
Mostly because he's so excited

03:38.385 --> 03:39.761
to go back to work.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.596
He got the all-clear?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.596
Any day now.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
But what do I do about Catalina?

03:43.306 --> 03:44.474
I've been dropping subtle hints,

03:44.474 --> 03:46.267
and she is not

03:44.474 --> 03:46.267
picking up on them.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.353
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

03:46.267 --> 03:48.353
<i>And speaking of subtle hints...</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:50.271
Mmm!

03:50.271 --> 03:52.691
What a miracle that

03:50.271 --> 03:52.691
my Tiago product integration

03:52.691 --> 03:56.236
has yielded me

03:52.691 --> 03:56.236
my new favorite cereal!

03:56.236 --> 03:58.780
It is super delicious.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.616
Subtle is overrated.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.035
Just kick her out.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.035
But I feel bad.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.162
I was the one who

04:03.035 --> 04:05.162
invited her to stay.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.789
And, I mean, it's not like

04:05.162 --> 04:07.789
she'll be on my couch forever.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.332
Right?

04:07.789 --> 04:09.332
Jane!

04:09.332 --> 04:11.501
I didn't know you were here.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.794
Are you coming to church

04:11.501 --> 04:12.794
with me?

04:12.794 --> 04:14.171
Oh, sorry, Abuela,

04:14.171 --> 04:16.339
I'm meeting my discussion group

04:14.171 --> 04:16.339
at school.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.966
My new chapter's being

04:16.339 --> 04:17.966
critiqued, and I threaded in

04:17.966 --> 04:20.802
some suspense,

04:17.966 --> 04:20.802
so I want to see how it landed.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.512
<i>Oh. I'm on the edge of my seat.</i>

04:22.512 --> 04:23.847
It's always something.

04:23.847 --> 04:26.558
What?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.558
Nothing.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.853
It's just that you haven't

04:26.558 --> 04:29.853
been to church in a while.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.813
That's not true.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.813
I just went last...

04:31.813 --> 04:33.107
Mm-hmm.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.608
Father Gustavo was

04:33.107 --> 04:34.608
asking about you.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.359
I wasn't sure

04:34.608 --> 04:36.359
what to tell him.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.195
<i>Wow. She's really</i>

04:36.359 --> 04:38.195
<i>laying on the guilt.</i>

04:38.195 --> 04:39.696
Ma, come on,

04:39.696 --> 04:41.448
she's busy.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.448
Oh, I get it.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.409
I'm just worried

04:41.448 --> 04:44.409
for Mateo, that's all.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.037
What? Why?

04:47.037 --> 04:50.999
Well, you're responsible

04:47.037 --> 04:50.999
for his spiritual upbringing.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.918
I mean, if not you, who?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.878
<i>El diablo?</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:57.505
Anyway, I don't mean

04:54.878 --> 04:57.505
to make you feel guilty.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.716
( chuckles ):<i> Yeah. Right.</i>

04:57.505 --> 04:59.716
You just have to decide

04:59.716 --> 05:03.678
if you want Mateo

04:59.716 --> 05:03.678
to have God in his life.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.889
And if he doesn't, well,

05:05.889 --> 05:10.102
I guess he'll deal

05:05.889 --> 05:10.102
with the consequences.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.395
( laughs ):<i> Damn, Jane,</i>

05:10.102 --> 05:12.395
<i>you just got Abuela'd.</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:26.160
about anything, Xiomara?

05:26.160 --> 05:27.661
No. Why?

05:27.661 --> 05:30.122
No reason.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.122
Just curious.

05:30.122 --> 05:33.208
Well, uh, I should go too.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.459
Oh.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.044
Where are you going?

05:34.459 --> 05:36.044
I told you.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.754
Meeting with the electrician

05:36.044 --> 05:37.754
at the studio.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.507
Interesting.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.507
Not really.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.425
Hey, why don't I come with you?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.425
I have a lot

05:42.425 --> 05:44.136
of questions

05:42.425 --> 05:44.136
about electricity.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.138
No, that's okay,

05:44.136 --> 05:46.138
you don't have to.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.473
Oh, but I'd like to.

05:46.138 --> 05:48.473
Oh, it's gonna be boring.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.934
You underestimate my

05:48.473 --> 05:50.934
fascination with electricity.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.436
And it'll take hours.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.436
Stop the nonsense, Xiomara!

05:53.436 --> 05:54.813
I know you're

05:53.436 --> 05:54.813
meeting Bruce!

05:54.813 --> 05:56.606
What?

05:54.813 --> 05:56.606
I saw you kissing him

05:56.606 --> 05:58.233
the other night.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.194
I don't understand.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.194
You said you told him off.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.655
I did. But then...

06:00.194 --> 06:03.655
we started talking

06:03.655 --> 06:05.866
and... he's different.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.659
He-- He got a divorce.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.659
Then why are you

06:07.659 --> 06:09.286
keeping it a secret?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.412
Because Jane would be really

06:09.286 --> 06:11.412
upset if we were together.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.291
And-- And we're not yet.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.291
We're-- We're just exploring.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.043
Please, don't say anything.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.921
I don't want to be

06:16.043 --> 06:19.921
in the middle.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.921
Just give me some time.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.633
And, look...

06:23.633 --> 06:27.179
I know it must have been hard

06:23.633 --> 06:27.179
seeing me with someone else.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.763
( stifled laugh ):

06:27.179 --> 06:28.763
Oh, please.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.307
I have hundreds

06:30.307 --> 06:33.227
of women lining up

06:30.307 --> 06:33.227
to meet me. Literally.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.188
So while you are meeting

06:33.227 --> 06:36.188
with your one measly lover,

06:36.188 --> 06:39.316
I will be meeting

06:36.188 --> 06:39.316
with a matchmaker.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.568
WOMAN:<i> First of all,</i>

06:39.316 --> 06:41.568
<i>I'm not a matchmaker.</i>

06:41.568 --> 06:43.320
I am a love dealer.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.905
That's trademarked.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.040
So it says you want

06:51.870 --> 06:55.040
someone fertile?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.876
Exactly. I need a woman who

06:55.040 --> 06:57.876
wants children right away.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.460
That's nonnegotiable.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.004
And while I heard

06:59.460 --> 07:01.004
that thing about beauty

07:01.004 --> 07:04.507
being only skin deep,

07:01.004 --> 07:04.507
I have to look at that skin,

07:04.507 --> 07:06.843
so let's... double down on that.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.843
Okay.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.970
Anything else?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.970
Bilingual a plus.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.430
Fluent in social media.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.765
Comfortable with my fame.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.141
And with sharing my penis

07:13.141 --> 07:14.559
with the world. Oh.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.978
I will be shooting

07:14.559 --> 07:16.978
a full-frontal role next week.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.106
Tell the ladies that.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.106
My penis is

07:19.106 --> 07:20.690
big-screen-worthy.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.690
I'm sure.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.690
But you won't be

07:20.690 --> 07:22.359
showing it to any of my girls.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.653
That's one of my three rules.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.117
No talking about exes.

07:31.659 --> 07:32.911
No heavy drinking on dates.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.205
And most importantly,

07:35.205 --> 07:37.457
no shtupping

07:35.205 --> 07:37.457
until it's serious.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.545
Rogelio de la Vega

07:39.751 --> 07:42.545
doesn't<i> shtup.</i>

07:42.545 --> 07:45.132
He makes love.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.132
Whatever.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.050
No lovemaking

07:45.132 --> 07:47.050
until it's serious.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.593
This is about building

07:47.050 --> 07:48.593
a strong foundation

07:48.593 --> 07:52.806
for a real relationship,

07:48.593 --> 07:52.806
Rogelio.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.182
Oh, I understand.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.725
But you should prepare the women

07:55.725 --> 07:57.477
for the devastation

07:55.725 --> 07:57.477
they will feel

07:57.477 --> 08:00.063
once they learn they

07:57.477 --> 08:00.063
won't be able to immediately...

08:00.063 --> 08:02.065
make love to me.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.817
I don't want to shock them.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.444
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

08:03.817 --> 08:05.444
<i>And speaking of shocks...</i>

08:05.444 --> 08:07.654
( door closes )

08:05.444 --> 08:07.654
( screams, gasps )

08:07.654 --> 08:08.863
You scared me.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.282
Oh. Sorry.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.825
I'm four hours

08:10.282 --> 08:11.825
into a Hitchcock binge.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.493
What? Why?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.493
My writer's group.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.578
They all agree

08:13.493 --> 08:15.578
that I should push farther

08:15.578 --> 08:17.872
with this whole

08:15.578 --> 08:17.872
<i>Rear Window</i> thing in my novel.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.374
I just played along.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.626
I had no idea what they meant.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.626
But I'm catching up.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.087
Turns out this Alfred Hitchcock

08:21.626 --> 08:24.087
is pretty good.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.881
Four years I've been trying

08:24.087 --> 08:26.881
to get you to watch.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.468
Four years.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.468
Live in the here and now, baby.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.719
Oh, are those notes

08:29.468 --> 08:31.719
you're taking?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.805
Uh, I'm not experienced

08:31.719 --> 08:33.805
with suspense,

08:33.805 --> 08:35.807
but I'm learning a lot--

08:33.805 --> 08:35.807
He had this

08:35.807 --> 08:38.268
"bomb under the table" theory.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.268
Oh, that's easy.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.354
Controlled detonation's really

08:38.268 --> 08:40.354
your only hope to defuse a bomb.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.896
Here's how it works.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.896
Take a scene

08:41.896 --> 08:43.773
with two people sitting

08:41.896 --> 08:43.773
at a table talking.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.941
Really boring, right?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.860
( yawning ):

08:44.941 --> 08:46.860
<i>Yes. Much like a scene</i>

08:46.860 --> 08:49.029
<i>with two married people</i>

08:46.860 --> 08:49.029
<i>sitting on a couch talking.</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:51.614
Now tell the audience

08:49.029 --> 08:51.614
that there's a bomb

08:51.614 --> 08:53.158
under the table.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.742
<i>I'm listening.</i>

08:54.742 --> 08:56.995
And you're waiting

08:54.742 --> 08:56.995
for that bomb to go off.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.830
You have to give

08:56.995 --> 08:58.830
the audience information

08:58.830 --> 09:01.500
the protagonist doesn't have

08:58.830 --> 09:01.500
to build tension.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.464
Then you let one character

09:04.878 --> 09:07.464
know about the bomb,

09:07.464 --> 09:09.341
but they can't tell anybody.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.925
Now you're on the edge

09:09.341 --> 09:10.925
of your seat

09:10.925 --> 09:12.593
wondering what

09:10.925 --> 09:12.593
that person's gonna do.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.517
And just when the audience

09:15.096 --> 09:18.517
can't stand the tension,

09:18.517 --> 09:20.268
you defuse it!

09:18.517 --> 09:20.268
In the nick of time,

09:20.268 --> 09:21.520
someone throws the bomb

09:20.268 --> 09:21.520
out the window,

09:21.520 --> 09:22.854
it never goes off.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.276
I still think a SWAT team

09:25.524 --> 09:28.276
and controlled detonation's

09:25.524 --> 09:28.276
the way to go.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.528
( grunts )

09:29.528 --> 09:30.987
( laughs )

09:30.987 --> 09:32.947
<i>Hmm, I like these rules.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:35.700
<i>In fact, I'm going to try out</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:35.700
<i>rule number one.</i>

09:37.244 --> 09:40.080
<i>See this?</i>

09:37.244 --> 09:40.080
<i>What's in that envelope</i>

09:40.080 --> 09:42.582
<i>is going to change</i> everything.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.211
<i>Did it work? Are you</i>

09:42.582 --> 09:46.211
<i>on the edge of your seat?</i>

09:46.211 --> 09:49.005
<i>In any case,</i>

09:46.211 --> 09:49.005
<i>we're not there yet.</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:50.424
<i>Some groundwork to lay first.</i>

09:50.424 --> 09:52.342
So your mother's

09:52.342 --> 09:55.762
coded bank account number links

09:52.342 --> 09:55.762
to this convent in Italy.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.806
A convent?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.806
I take it she wasn't religious.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.142
Well, we certainly

10:01.142 --> 10:03.103
never went to church.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.103
<i>Hmm.</i>

10:03.103 --> 10:04.729
<i>Suspicious.</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:07.815
(<i> theme to</i> Alfred Hitchcock

10:04.729 --> 10:07.815
Presents<i> playing</i> )

10:15.990 --> 10:18.034
The convent's

10:15.990 --> 10:18.034
in Orvieto.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.495
That's where my mother was born.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.495
She's been paying them

10:20.495 --> 10:22.705
ten grand a month since 1984.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.584
Any idea what those payments

10:22.705 --> 10:25.584
might be about?

10:25.584 --> 10:28.044
I have no idea.

10:25.584 --> 10:28.044
I hardly knew her.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.546
( grunts )

10:29.546 --> 10:31.548
But monthly payments...

10:31.548 --> 10:34.134
Why, that sounds like...

10:34.134 --> 10:36.761
A bribe... or blackmail.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.472
RAFAEL:

10:36.761 --> 10:38.472
So, what now?

10:38.472 --> 10:39.722
We wait to see

10:39.722 --> 10:41.641
what the Italian

10:39.722 --> 10:41.641
authorities dig up

10:41.641 --> 10:44.644
on those-those-those-those

10:41.641 --> 10:44.644
crooked little nuns.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.396
Stop it right there.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.316
All nuns aren't crooked.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.316
( hissing )

10:49.316 --> 10:51.610
Seriously, you can't assume

10:49.316 --> 10:51.610
that all nuns are evil.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.320
Watch it with the knife.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.946
All we know right now

10:54.946 --> 10:57.324
is someone in the convent

10:54.946 --> 10:57.324
deposited those checks.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
Finding out exactly who

10:59.159 --> 11:02.162
is like a needle in

10:59.159 --> 11:02.162
an Italian haystack, for now.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.373
So while we're on

11:02.162 --> 11:05.373
the subject of...

11:05.373 --> 11:07.167
Catholic stuff,

11:07.167 --> 11:09.503
I was wondering if I could

11:07.167 --> 11:09.503
take Mateo Sunday mornings.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.004
Every Sunday?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.671
Yeah. I want to start

11:11.004 --> 11:12.671
bringing him to church.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.757
No. No, he's too young.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.635
Well, I went to church

11:14.757 --> 11:16.635
when I was his age.

11:16.635 --> 11:17.969
And you can't just say, "no."

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
Well, I can't just say

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
"yes," either.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.721
It's part of

11:19.387 --> 11:20.721
a bigger conversation.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.349
What is?

11:20.721 --> 11:22.349
I just don't

11:22.349 --> 11:24.267
want him to be super religious.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.103
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

11:24.267 --> 11:27.103
<i>Ah, yes. As you recall,</i>

11:24.267 --> 11:27.103
<i>the new dynamic</i>

11:27.103 --> 11:30.064
<i>between Jane and Rafael</i>

11:27.103 --> 11:30.064
<i>involves Rafael</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:32.484
<i>feeling much more comfortable</i>

11:30.064 --> 11:32.484
<i>disagreeing with Jane.</i>

11:32.484 --> 11:34.235
<i>Which Jane really hates.</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:35.987
And by super religious,

11:34.235 --> 11:35.987
you mean...

11:35.987 --> 11:38.072
Church every Sunday,

11:35.987 --> 11:38.072
before he's able

11:38.072 --> 11:39.866
to make the choice

11:38.072 --> 11:39.866
to go for himself.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.201
That's not super religious.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.201
It is to me.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.452
And wait,

11:41.201 --> 11:42.452
I already told you,

11:42.452 --> 11:43.828
if I disagreed,

11:42.452 --> 11:43.828
I'm gonna push back.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.164
Yeah, but I was hoping,

11:43.828 --> 11:46.164
like, once a year.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.790
You're the one

11:46.164 --> 11:47.790

11:47.790 --> 11:50.001

11:58.092 --> 12:00.094

11:58.092 --> 12:00.094

18:13.342 --> 18:14.635

the DRIA gala Web site,

18:14.635 --> 18:16.679

18:14.635 --> 18:16.679

18:16.679 --> 18:19.223

18:24.812 --> 18:27.023
Don't be condescending.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.023
I'm sorry.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.414

18:43.414 --> 18:44.624

18:44.624 --> 18:46.793
Right.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.544
So, remember our

18:46.793 --> 18:48.544
favorite Italian convent

18:48.544 --> 18:50.880
getting 10K a

18:48.544 --> 18:50.880

18:48.544 --> 18:50.880
Mm-hmm.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.506
They also had several

18:50.880 --> 18:52.506
significant pieces

18:53.841 --> 18:56.510

18:59.179 --> 19:00.974

25:01.417 --> 25:03.252
I thought it was weird

25:03.252 --> 25:04.920
that you suddenly

25:03.252 --> 25:04.920
bailed on your gala.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.215
And... I didn't find your name

25:04.920 --> 25:08.215
anywhere on that Web site.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.716
Because I'm an

25:08.215 --> 25:09.716
anonymous benefactor.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.010
What does that

25:09.716 --> 25:11.010
have to do with my bag?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.345
I saw cash and jewels.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.929
I mean, that's suspicious,

25:12.345 --> 25:13.929
right?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.389
Not when you've just

25:13.929 --> 25:15.389
reentered the States

25:15.389 --> 25:16.640
from Venezuela,

25:15.389 --> 25:16.640
where it's recommended

25:16.640 --> 25:18.184
non-residents carry

25:16.640 --> 25:18.184
U.S. dollars.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.853
Darling, ATMs aren't safe.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.563
Foreign credit cards

25:20.853 --> 25:23.563
aren't reliable.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
The jewels are family heirlooms

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
I intend to place for auction

25:25.565 --> 25:27.401
at Sotheby's

25:25.565 --> 25:27.401
once I'm back in the city.

25:27.401 --> 25:30.070
At which point, I'll send

25:27.401 --> 25:30.070
the money back to Venezuela,

25:30.070 --> 25:32.365
where our family

25:30.070 --> 25:32.365
is desperately poor,

25:32.365 --> 25:34.241
along with the rest

25:32.365 --> 25:34.241
of the country.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.249

DARCI:

25:42.249 --> 25:43.959
<i>I had you all wrong.</i>

You are just the kind

25:43.959 --> 25:45.919
of entitled client

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
I do not tolerate as one of

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
my High Dollar Rollers!

25:48.797 --> 25:50.883
Clearly,

25:48.797 --> 25:50.883
you're hung up on your ex.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.385
You've wasted my time

25:52.385 --> 25:54.470
and the time of 27 quality girls

25:52.385 --> 25:54.470
I brought you,

25:54.470 --> 25:55.929
including Denise Richards,

25:55.929 --> 25:57.764
an Olsen twin

25:55.929 --> 25:57.764
and a Duggar.

25:57.764 --> 26:01.352
I will send Denise Richards

25:57.764 --> 26:01.352
a Ropology basket.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.644
You're out of the club, Rogelio.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.399
I understand.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.527
Maybe I'm not looking

26:06.399 --> 26:09.527
for love after all.

26:09.527 --> 26:11.487
Would have been nice to know

26:09.527 --> 26:11.487
before I put your picture on

26:09.527 --> 26:11.487
Twitter.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.531
I just mean,

26:11.487 --> 26:13.531
I might have to accept

26:13.531 --> 26:15.991
it's not gonna happen right now,

26:13.531 --> 26:15.991
which is okay.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.660
What's more important to me

26:15.991 --> 26:18.660
is a baby.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.914
If you don't mind my asking,

26:21.914 --> 26:24.124
why are you so obsessed

26:21.914 --> 26:24.124
with having a kid?

26:24.124 --> 26:26.377
Well...

26:26.377 --> 26:28.337
I only met my daughter Jane

26:26.377 --> 26:28.337
recently,

26:28.337 --> 26:31.507
and being her dad has been

26:28.337 --> 26:31.507
the greatest joy in my life.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.633
But I didn't get to do it

26:33.633 --> 26:35.886
from the beginning.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.679
And I want that, Darci.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.226
I don't believe it.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.895
( chuckles ): Stop.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.895
She went through your bag.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.646
Life's too short to stay mad.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.024
As the Italians say:

26:49.024 --> 26:51.860
<i>Oggi in figura,</i>

26:49.024 --> 26:51.860
<i>domani in sepoltura.</i>

26:51.860 --> 26:53.946
( laughs ):

26:51.860 --> 26:53.946
Sorry.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.198
( voice fading ):

26:53.946 --> 26:56.198
It means, "Today in person,

26:53.946 --> 26:56.198
tomorrow in the grave."

26:56.198 --> 26:59.285
Kind of like carpe diem.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.285
(<i> church bell tolls</i> )

26:59.285 --> 27:05.332
You think you're a good person,

26:59.285 --> 27:05.332
but you should be ashamed!

27:08.544 --> 27:12.131
I told you

27:08.544 --> 27:12.131
Mommy would be back.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.799
Now, come on.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.973
RAFAEL:<i> It wasn't a church</i>

27:18.845 --> 27:20.973
<i>I remembered.</i>

27:20.973 --> 27:22.724
It was a convent.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.352
There was a nun who spoke

27:22.724 --> 27:25.352
Italian and this creepy statue.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.354
It was a woman's head

27:25.352 --> 27:27.354
wearing a veil.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.772
MICHAEL:

27:27.354 --> 27:28.772
Is that it?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.774
Yeah.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.401
Yeah, that looks right.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.820
It's in St. Genevieve's

27:32.401 --> 27:34.820
Convent here in Miami.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.489
And guess where

27:34.820 --> 27:36.489
their mother superior,

27:36.489 --> 27:38.073
Constantine Ciancuilli,

27:38.073 --> 27:39.783
did her junior nun training.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.910
It's her novitiate,

27:39.783 --> 27:41.910
not junior nun training.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.910
Right.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.703
She was at the convent

27:41.910 --> 27:43.703
in Orvieto.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.038
Okay. So, what now?

27:43.703 --> 27:45.038
You question her,

27:45.038 --> 27:46.873
you search her

27:45.038 --> 27:46.873
office, or what?

27:46.873 --> 27:49.251
MICHAEL: Your childhood memory

27:46.873 --> 27:49.251
isn't enough for a warrant.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.752
Plus, if she was involved

27:49.251 --> 27:50.752
with your mom

27:50.752 --> 27:54.173
and dealing stolen art,

27:50.752 --> 27:54.173
she could run.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.216
Okay, this is interesting.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.345
Mother Constantine visits St.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.345
Vincent's Hospital every weekday

27:59.345 --> 28:00.846
at 2:00 pm, and there are tours

28:00.846 --> 28:02.640
of the convent

28:00.846 --> 28:02.640
every day at 2:30.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.975
So you want me to take a tour,

28:02.640 --> 28:04.975
see if it triggers anything?

28:04.975 --> 28:08.479
Exactly. Anything more specific

28:04.975 --> 28:08.479
could get us a warrant.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.481
RAFAEL: Yeah, cool. Okay, so

28:08.479 --> 28:10.481
I'll-I'll just go in there

28:10.481 --> 28:12.316
like a tourist and look

28:10.481 --> 28:12.316
around at all the nun stuff.

28:12.316 --> 28:13.733
Oh, my God.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.277
You can't go in there

28:13.733 --> 28:15.277
calling it "nun stuff."

28:15.277 --> 28:16.529
Let me go with him.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.364
I'll know

28:16.529 --> 28:18.364
the right questions to ask.

28:18.364 --> 28:22.034
Otherwise, he's gonna stick out

28:18.364 --> 28:22.034
like a rich, godless sore thumb.

28:28.999 --> 28:33.003
Yes, uh, we hear

28:28.999 --> 28:33.003
the main chapel is awesome.

Amen.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.653
is Rafael Solano.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.447

29:00.447 --> 29:02.157

SISTER JULIA:

29:05.160 --> 29:06.786
<i>Our convent</i>

29:06.786 --> 29:10.541
is in the Gothic style,

29:06.786 --> 29:10.541
rare to the Miami area.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.876
In modern times,

29:10.541 --> 29:12.876
service to the community

29:12.876 --> 29:15.128
has always been

29:12.876 --> 29:15.128
our main priority.

29:15.128 --> 29:18.257
In fact, originally, this

29:15.128 --> 29:18.257
convent<i> was</i> European.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.342
The structures were

29:18.257 --> 29:20.342
dismantled stone by stone,

29:20.342 --> 29:21.677
bound with

29:20.342 --> 29:21.677
protective hay...

29:21.677 --> 29:23.220
What?

29:23.220 --> 29:27.224
Uh, I don't know.

29:23.220 --> 29:27.224
Something feels familiar.

Yes.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.896
During my novitiate

33:00.896 --> 33:04.983
in Orvieto, the convent

33:00.896 --> 33:04.983
was in financial trouble.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.403
Our orphanage, it needed money.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.489
And then your father

33:08.403 --> 33:10.489
approached me.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.908
So he paid you to steal it?

33:12.908 --> 33:15.034
In my idealistic youth,

33:15.034 --> 33:18.997
I saw myself as a Robin Hood

33:15.034 --> 33:18.997
of sorts,

33:18.997 --> 33:21.625
taking from the rich

33:18.997 --> 33:21.625
to help the orphans.

33:21.625 --> 33:25.211
Why did my mother pay you

33:21.625 --> 33:25.211
every month, even after he died?

33:25.211 --> 33:28.340
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<i> Okay.</i>

33:25.211 --> 33:28.340
<i>I think this is the big reveal.</i>

33:28.340 --> 33:30.133
<i>Brace yourself, buddy.</i>

33:30.133 --> 33:33.637
Elena discovered the deal

33:30.133 --> 33:33.637
I made with Emilio

33:33.637 --> 33:36.974
and threatened

33:33.637 --> 33:36.974
to expose me.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.351
Unless I did something for her.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.060
She continued

33:39.351 --> 33:41.060
to pay me

33:41.060 --> 33:44.230
every month, even though

33:41.060 --> 33:44.230
I wanted her to stop.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.316
To remind me,

33:44.230 --> 33:46.316
I think.

33:46.316 --> 33:48.777
As if I could

33:46.316 --> 33:48.777
ever forget.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.280
In any case, the truth.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.574
You deserve it.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.875
Go on.

34:02.875 --> 34:04.417
Open it.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.512
About... the flying buttresses.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.014
Sorry, dear,

34:17.014 --> 34:18.765
but we've been over

34:17.014 --> 34:18.765
everything I know

34:18.765 --> 34:20.642
about the building's

34:18.765 --> 34:20.642
architecture.

34:20.642 --> 34:23.061

34:20.642 --> 34:23.061
<i>not the mother superior.</i>

34:23.061 --> 34:24.604
Wait, please!

34:24.604 --> 34:26.857
There is something else

34:24.604 --> 34:26.857
I need to talk about.

34:26.857 --> 34:30.235
It's... personal.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.528
It's a...

34:31.528 --> 34:33.739
r-really personal problem.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.240
Yes?

34:39.369 --> 34:42.915
What do you do if you

34:39.369 --> 34:42.915
and your child's father differ,

34:42.915 --> 34:44.791
in terms

34:42.915 --> 34:44.791
of religious upbringing?

34:44.791 --> 34:47.961
Oh, well, that's a problem

34:44.791 --> 34:47.961
many families face.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.588
Exactly, exactly.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.173
See, I've always gone

34:49.588 --> 34:52.173
to mass regularly.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.426
I mean, not lately, but...

34:52.173 --> 34:54.426
And why do you think

34:54.426 --> 34:55.677
that is?

34:55.677 --> 34:58.304
Oh. Well, I don't know.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.639
Life got in the way,

34:59.639 --> 35:02.350
I guess,

34:59.639 --> 35:02.350
and then, um...

35:02.350 --> 35:05.771
Well, my husband got shot,

35:02.350 --> 35:05.771
and he almost died.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.736
Yeah, so that was big.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.613
Um...

35:16.448 --> 35:21.078
And I felt mad at God,

35:16.448 --> 35:21.078
honestly.

35:21.078 --> 35:25.498
Because... why did that happen?

35:25.498 --> 35:28.001
Why would he do that?

35:25.498 --> 35:28.001
I mean, what is the reason?

35:28.001 --> 35:29.461
( sniffles )

35:29.461 --> 35:31.170
I'm sorry.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.256
No, no, no.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.256
It's all right.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.676
Even nuns experience doubt

35:33.256 --> 35:36.676
at times.

35:36.676 --> 35:41.264
And I can see that having

35:36.676 --> 35:41.264
a relationship with God

35:41.264 --> 35:42.849
is important to you.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.351
And as with all

35:42.849 --> 35:45.351
relationships,

35:45.351 --> 35:48.939
sometimes they take work.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.693
So we should go.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.570
Are you okay?

35:55.570 --> 35:57.489
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.033
Thank you.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.080
( quietly ): Sorry. I was trying

36:02.661 --> 36:05.080
to distract the mother superior.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.082
That's not

36:05.080 --> 36:07.082
the mother superior.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.334
So, nothing?

36:09.334 --> 36:11.461
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

36:09.334 --> 36:11.461
<i>Wait, what was in the envelope?</i>

36:11.461 --> 36:13.630
No. Nothing.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.381
And I'm returning

36:13.630 --> 36:15.381
the stolen art

36:15.381 --> 36:17.009
and turning myself in

36:15.381 --> 36:17.009
to the police.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.385
What?

36:17.009 --> 36:19.385
I don't want you

36:17.009 --> 36:19.385
to withhold any evidence

36:19.385 --> 36:21.304
that could help

36:19.385 --> 36:21.304
with this investigation.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.224
You don't have to make

36:22.848 --> 36:25.224
a decision right now.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.768
I've already decided.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.021
I want to set a good example

36:26.768 --> 36:29.021
for Mateo.

36:29.021 --> 36:31.690
So I have to stop

36:29.021 --> 36:31.690
this completely insane

36:31.690 --> 36:34.317
and corrupt cycle

36:31.690 --> 36:34.317
that is the Solano family.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.823
So I've been thinking,

36:39.823 --> 36:42.617
I should work on my relationship

36:39.823 --> 36:42.617
with God right now.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.452
Hold off a little

36:42.617 --> 36:44.452
with Mateo.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.538
Yeah?

36:46.538 --> 36:47.956
I think that's a good idea.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.249
And I'm happy to go to church

36:47.956 --> 36:50.249
with you.

36:50.249 --> 36:51.501
Occasionally.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.378
I'm gonna be

36:51.501 --> 36:53.378
busy soon,

36:53.378 --> 36:54.880
back to work.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.464
Plus, you and Abuela could use

36:54.880 --> 36:56.464
the quality time.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.299
Thank you.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.843
Mwah. Now leave me alone.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.761
I've got to get

36:59.843 --> 37:01.761
some writing done.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.761
Okay.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.429
Oh, yeah.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.429
Here we go.

You're up early.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.952
I want to finish this chapter

37:22.908 --> 37:25.952
before brunch at Abuela's.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.205
I'm changing it from a

37:25.952 --> 37:28.205
first-person narrative to third.

37:28.205 --> 37:30.749
An omniscient point of

37:36.379 --> 37:37.881
Okay.

37:37.881 --> 37:40.926
What's wrong? What's going on?

37:40.926 --> 37:43.845
I didn't pass my physical.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.847
I can't go back to the force.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.225
What? No.

37:48.225 --> 37:49.684
They said desk duty.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.811
I can do desk duty.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.943
I'm sorry about Michael.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.945
Yeah. He just needs

37:57.943 --> 37:59.945
a little time alone.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.154
Yeah.

38:01.154 --> 38:02.948
Sit?

I know you know.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.836
About Bruce.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.379
What are you doing, Mom?

38:18.379 --> 38:20.381
He's changed. He has.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.381
Stop.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.050
He's a good person.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.552
He's a jerk who broke

38:22.050 --> 38:24.552
your heart over and over.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.721
Not to mention he's a

38:24.552 --> 38:26.721
liar who hid the fact

38:26.721 --> 38:28.181
that he was

38:26.721 --> 38:28.181
married from you.

38:30.183 --> 38:33.186
No. He didn't.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.063
What?

38:35.063 --> 38:37.941
I knew.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.736
I knew he was married

38:37.941 --> 38:41.736

38:41.736 --> 38:43.863
Great.

Thank you, Darci Factor,

38:48.576 --> 38:51.121
thank you.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.665
Because I've found just

38:51.121 --> 38:53.665
what you're looking for.

38:53.665 --> 38:57.752
This girl shares your values,

38:53.665 --> 38:57.752
your desires.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.338
No attachments.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.338
Has her own money.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.215
And most importantly,

39:00.338 --> 39:02.215
wants a baby.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.009
You're not trying to pawn off

39:02.215 --> 39:04.009
Chelsea Handler on me again,

39:04.009 --> 39:05.218
are you?

39:05.218 --> 39:07.804
Rogelio, it's me.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.097
Not to date.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.932
Just to have a baby with.

39:10.932 --> 39:12.267
Think about it.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.685
We'd be very

39:13.685 --> 39:14.936
compatible parents.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.688
Two aging narcissists.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.648
We'd only have the kid

39:16.688 --> 39:18.648
half the time.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.399
The other half,

39:18.648 --> 39:20.399
we'd get to have lives.

39:20.399 --> 39:24.737
I can't believe

39:20.399 --> 39:24.737
you called me aging.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.782
Will you at least think

39:25.864 --> 39:27.782
about it?

39:27.782 --> 39:30.202
I'm having a baby!

39:33.412 --> 39:36.082
So congratulations

I'll check in on him.

And with

40:07.197 --> 40:08.447
my mother's jewels?

Oh, no. Does this mean

you're mad?

40:38.603 --> 40:39.979
What is it?

40:43.816 --> 40:47.195
Mother Constantine

40:43.816 --> 40:47.195
gave it to me.

It's a secret she kept for Elena

40:47.195 --> 40:51.241
for 32 years.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.034
Open it.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.707
What is it?

My birth certificate.

I was born

41:03.628 --> 41:06.005
in Italy.

Right around the time

41:06.005 --> 41:09.968

She bribed the nuns,

41:09.968 --> 41:12.720
and they brought me over.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.680
What?

41:16.641 --> 41:18.393
I'm not a Solano.
