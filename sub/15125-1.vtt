WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.075
Maw Maw! Hurry up!

00:07.108 --> 00:08.476
It's time for the yard movie.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.311
Who's the pygmy?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.313
What's it doing in my seat?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.648
Maw Maw, this is your
great-granddaughter, Hope.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.250
Who the heck are you?

00:16.284 --> 00:18.486
Yeah, I think
Maw Maw's confused again.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.488
Maw Maw, what's the
last thing you remember?

00:20.521 --> 00:23.591
That dopey looking kid went out
to get bubblegum ice cream.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.594
Wow. She's forgotten, like,
the last three years.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.597
Get out the instruments,
she needs a memory reset.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.199
One, two, three...

00:31.232 --> 00:32.900
*

00:32.933 --> 00:35.203
* Jimmy brought home
a serial killer *

00:35.236 --> 00:37.771
* And he nailed her
before he knew *

00:37.805 --> 00:40.040
* They locked her up without
a key, but in her guilty belly *

00:40.074 --> 00:41.942
* A darling baby grew

00:41.975 --> 00:44.345
*

00:44.378 --> 00:46.046
* Jimmy was a struggling
single father *

00:46.080 --> 00:48.549
* Till he found a girl
to help him cope *

00:48.582 --> 00:51.285
* That's your
great-grandson Jimmy *

00:51.319 --> 00:53.554
* And his wife
Sabrina *

00:53.587 --> 00:55.889
* And...

00:55.923 --> 00:57.191
* Their daughter...

00:57.225 --> 00:59.427
Monkey?

00:59.460 --> 01:02.029
Maybe some specifics
would jog her memory.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.364
Maw Maw, remember how...

01:03.397 --> 01:05.466
* Hope got stuck
in Virginia's shed *

01:05.499 --> 01:08.136
* You Jenga-ed her out
or she'd be dead *

01:08.169 --> 01:10.471
* We went to Vegas
with Virginia's cousin *

01:10.504 --> 01:12.873
* Burt was Jewish
* And then he wasn't

01:12.906 --> 01:15.042
* Pitched our inventions
to Andrew Dice Clay *

01:15.075 --> 01:17.378
* Jimmy married Frank,
although he's not gay *

01:17.411 --> 01:20.381
* We met Jimmy's almost family,
a bunch of racists *

01:20.414 --> 01:22.316
* We caught a squirrel
who was a rapist *

01:22.350 --> 01:24.785
VIRGINIA:
* We busted you out
of a nursing home *

01:24.818 --> 01:27.321
* They fought a bear,
we danced with some *

01:27.355 --> 01:28.556
* Bought a used
time machine *

01:28.589 --> 01:30.658
* Fought a giant candy war
* Trained a pig

01:30.691 --> 01:31.992
* Sold pigurines

01:32.025 --> 01:37.598
* And so, so, so much more...

01:37.631 --> 01:39.667
Maw Maw, do you
remember it now?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.602
Are you still confused?

01:41.635 --> 01:43.471
Nope. That's...

01:43.504 --> 01:45.973
* Barney, Frank,
the odd one's Shelley *

01:46.006 --> 01:47.308
* Dancin' Dan

01:47.341 --> 01:48.942
* I know I'm Maw Maw

01:48.976 --> 01:50.344
* My granddaughter,
Virginia *

01:50.378 --> 01:52.746
* Her husband Burt,
my great-grandson Jimmy *

01:52.780 --> 01:54.182
* His wife Sabrina

01:54.215 --> 01:57.851
* And... their daughter...

01:57.885 --> 02:00.154
(holding note)

02:01.789 --> 02:03.691
I want to say...

02:03.724 --> 02:05.159
Edgar.

02:05.193 --> 02:06.827
(groans)

02:06.860 --> 02:08.196
Hope!

02:08.229 --> 02:09.997
I hope your name is Edgar, too--

02:10.030 --> 02:12.132
that would be hilarious.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.203
* Whoo!

02:15.236 --> 02:17.838
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

02:17.871 --> 02:19.807
* Oh, oh, oh!

02:35.823 --> 02:37.225
(grunting)

02:37.258 --> 02:38.892
VIRGINIA:
Burt!

02:38.926 --> 02:40.394
You got to come with me.
I saw him again.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.062
That guy who looks like
white Morgan Freeman?

02:42.095 --> 02:43.564
No. Déjà Vu Man!

02:43.597 --> 02:44.898
Damn, I always miss him.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.000
What are they
talking about?
Déjà Vu Man.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.402
He's mom's imaginary friend.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.871
He's not imaginary.
He's real.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.574
He shows up every few years.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.676
The first time,
I was waiting for Paw Paw

02:55.709 --> 02:58.212
to pick me up from school.
I just thought he was

02:58.246 --> 03:00.848
a pervert, but then when I saw
he didn't have a mustache,

03:00.881 --> 03:02.683
I assumed
I was being discovered

03:02.716 --> 03:04.685
by an undercover
modeling talent scout.

03:08.121 --> 03:11.625
He always shows up when
I'm at my least photogenic.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.001
The last time before today
was about a year ago.

03:21.034 --> 03:21.769
Hey!

03:21.802 --> 03:23.070
(shutter clicks)

03:23.103 --> 03:24.372
Hey!

03:27.708 --> 03:28.676
Wha...?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.177
(groans)

03:30.210 --> 03:31.445
We got to get
there quick.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.680
I followed him
to the barbershop

03:32.713 --> 03:34.047
and he doesn't have
a lot of hair.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.019
Someone gonna spin, or what?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.689
VIRGINIA (whispering):
There he is.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.291
Let me see.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.726
VIRGINIA:
You see him?

03:45.759 --> 03:48.128
BURT: No. The Hair-monizers
are in the way.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.431
They look like
they sound great.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.900
Hey! Cookie Man
is in there, too!

03:52.933 --> 03:54.034
Which one?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.036
The guy by the window
getting a shave.

03:56.069 --> 04:00.040
But... the guy by the
window getting a shave,
that's Déjà Vu Man!

04:00.073 --> 04:03.711
Then Déjà Vu Man
is also Cookie Man!
(gasps)

04:03.744 --> 04:05.713
SABRINA:
Okay, fine, I'll bite--

04:05.746 --> 04:07.548
who's Cookie Man?
Dad's imaginary friend.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.550
BURT: Cookie Man started
coming around years ago

04:09.583 --> 04:11.051
when Jimmy was little.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.554
He would show up at the park
and share his cookies with us.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.155
He was always
asking about Jimmy.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.890
(mouth full):
He's a very smart baby.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.126
I think he gets it from me.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.129
Are you drinking breast milk?
Yeah. You want some?

04:22.162 --> 04:23.864
Uh, no, I'm gonna pass.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.735
Well, that's an
interesting mask.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.737
Uh, what's he
supposed to be?

04:29.770 --> 04:32.740
We asked him what he
wanted to dress up as
for Halloween--

04:32.773 --> 04:34.141
he said, "Jimmy."

04:34.174 --> 04:36.510
It's the only word he knows.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.579
Isn't that
right, boy?
Jimmy.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.147
Want some more cookies?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.148
Jimmy.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.149
How old are you?

04:42.182 --> 04:43.250
Jimmy.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.251
What's your name?

04:44.284 --> 04:45.486
Cookie!

04:45.519 --> 04:47.688
Hey! He learned a new word!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.490
Told you he was smart.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.859
(loud crack)

04:51.892 --> 04:53.361
(laughing)

04:53.394 --> 04:54.662
He even showed up last month

04:54.695 --> 04:56.697
when I was
in the park with Hope.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.466
You know, there's
a lot of strangers

04:58.499 --> 05:00.801
who hand out treats
to kids in this town,

05:00.834 --> 05:03.136
but your cookies
are by far the best.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.473
Burt, please,
I'm not a stranger.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.108
I'm Cookie Man.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.643
I'm really
sorry, Burt.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.612
I always thought you
made up Cookie Man

05:11.645 --> 05:13.614
just to cover for
spoiling Jimmy's dinner.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.550
I'm sorry, too. I sometimes
wondered if Déjà Vu Man

05:16.584 --> 05:19.219
was just another one of your
crazy conspiracy theories,

05:19.252 --> 05:20.788
like UFOs or Bigfoot

05:20.821 --> 05:22.456
or that Delaware
doesn't actually exist.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.625
Name one person that's
ever been to Delaware.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.727
Did you say that
Déjà Vu-slash-Cookie Man

05:26.760 --> 05:28.896
was the one in front
getting a shave?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.732
Yeah. Why?
'Cause that's also
Super Curious Guy!

05:31.765 --> 05:33.401
VIRGINIA AND BURT:
Who's Super Curious Guy?

05:33.434 --> 05:36.303
That would be Jimmy's
imaginary friend.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.971
He is not imaginary.

05:38.005 --> 05:41.208
He's this guy who
shows up every now and
then on the loading dock

05:41.241 --> 05:42.810
and asks me tons
of questions.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.546
(chuckles) I remember
once that he said...

05:45.579 --> 05:47.247
Jimmy! There's no time!
I'm sure you got

05:47.280 --> 05:48.816
two or three funny memories
you could describe,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.818
but we need to figure
out what to do next.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.021
Ooh! White Morgan Freeman!

06:02.530 --> 06:04.264
SABRINA:
Oh, my God.

06:04.297 --> 06:07.668
Déjà Vu Man, Cookie Man,
and Super Curious Guy is also

06:07.701 --> 06:11.038
Roofie Surgeon, who I saw steal
my mother's kidney in 1996.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.172
Really?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.007
No, I just
felt left out.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.676
Okay, Burt, how
should we play this?
You guys,

06:15.709 --> 06:16.777
why don't you just
go over there

06:16.810 --> 06:18.011
and ask him
what's going on?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.346
(both laughing)

06:19.379 --> 06:20.881
You make suggestions
like that,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.349
you wonder why
you get left out?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.451
VIRGINIA:
Thanks, Sabrina.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.519
For all we know, he
works for the government

06:25.553 --> 06:28.856
and can lock us all up in
Geronimo Bay for the
rest of our lives.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.691
Oh, he's leaving,
we've got to follow him,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.192
find out who
he works for.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.794
Good idea.
Good idea.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.364
Jimmy, do you remember
how we talked about not
letting your parents

06:37.397 --> 06:38.866
drag us into something
crazy every week?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.434
Guys, I got to go
pick up Hope.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.435
(imitates whip cracking)

06:41.469 --> 06:42.536
I am trying to be

06:42.570 --> 06:43.804
a responsible parent.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.872
(imitates whip cracking)

06:44.905 --> 06:47.608
Oh, crap,
he's getting on his bike.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.878
Should we get the truck,
or follow him on foot?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.747
BURT:
Neither.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.654
(whispering):
I got him.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.064
I don't know who this guy is,
but he must be loaded.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.066
He's staying
at the Three Seasons Motel.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.267
(door closes)

07:15.268 --> 07:17.505
What is he doing in there?

07:17.538 --> 07:20.574
VIRGINIA:
He's either doing solo charades

07:20.608 --> 07:21.942
or Tai Chi.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.578
Or both,
if the clue is "Tai Chi."

07:24.612 --> 07:26.680
I got to be honest, he sounds
like an interesting guy.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.915
I'll bet he works
for the government.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.182
I just don't understand

07:29.216 --> 07:31.251
why they care so much
about what we're doing.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.453
Well, when I'm bored,
I like to look up

07:33.487 --> 07:35.188
how to build bombs
on the Internet.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.424
And I was a bit of a firebug
in the '90s.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.593
Maybe he's following us
for a good reason.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.095
Maybe he's one of those guys
from The Matrix.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.264
Then he could explain
The Matrix to me.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.098
(door closes)
Shh!

07:45.132 --> 07:46.934
VIRGINIA:
Oh, he's leaving.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.602
All right, here's our chance--
we're gonna break into

07:48.636 --> 07:50.037
his room and find
out who he is.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.038
Sounds like a plan.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.372
All I'm gonna need
is a lighter,

07:52.405 --> 07:53.941
a bottle
of toilet bowl cleaner,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.375
and an old-fashioned
alarm clock.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.611
We'll blow a hole
right through his door.

07:57.645 --> 08:01.114
Or we could just jimmy
it open with the "Do
Not Disturb" sign.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.215
Yep.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.456
Whoa! Fancy.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.125
This is the type of room
a rock star would O.D. in.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.293
Hey, check this out.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.294
What? What is it?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.964
(exhales)
The greatest bed ever made.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.732
You got to try this.
Burt,

08:18.766 --> 08:20.300
we can't.
We got to...

08:20.333 --> 08:21.802
Oh, my God.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.137
Huh?
(gasps)

08:24.171 --> 08:25.806
Ah...
Ah...

08:25.839 --> 08:27.975
It's both firm and soft.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.143
It's like lying on Santa Claus.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.779
Mmm.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.815
What the hell?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.016
(gasps)

08:36.049 --> 08:38.418
It's, like,
my whole life.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.653
This is creepy.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.188
Let's get out
of here quick,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.992
before he comes back and makes
masks out of our faces.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.227
Now I got a picture of him.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.428
(phone snaps shut)

08:48.461 --> 08:50.097
Wow. We both looked
really good

08:50.130 --> 08:51.565
in that shot.
You're right.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.334
If he doesn't turn out to be
a weirdo pervert killer,

08:54.367 --> 08:57.037
we should have him take
our Christmas card.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.375
Making a flyer to find out who
this guy is was a great idea.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.679
Flyers? Did that dopey son
of yours wander off again?

09:05.713 --> 09:06.847
No.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.048
Well, who's lost, then?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.850
Your crazy old grandmother?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.018
That's you, Maw Maw.

09:11.051 --> 09:15.088
Arnold! Get this picture
out of my house.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.223
You know who this is?

09:16.256 --> 09:19.026
Yeah. That's the bastard
who knocked my daughter up.

09:19.059 --> 09:24.031
BURT:
So the guy who knocked up
your daughter... would be...

09:24.064 --> 09:26.767
My father?!
No. Wait.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.405
Your father!

09:38.746 --> 09:41.548
I knew this no-good, disgusting
excuse for a man was trouble

09:41.581 --> 09:43.717
the minute I laid eyes on him.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.385
But he's my father.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.720
Paw Paw was your father.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.656
Arnold's just an immoral,
horrible person.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.224
You don't want to associate
with people like that.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.493
So you just made up a story
about Virginia's father dying

09:53.526 --> 09:54.795
in a horse racing accident?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.163
Why would you do that?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.398
Because you wanted
a pony and a father,

09:58.431 --> 10:01.234
and it solved
two problems at once.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.803
(sighs)

10:02.836 --> 10:05.639
Well... guess we'd
better go meet your dad.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.408
No way. If he wanted
to be a part of my life,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.310
he had plenty of chances
to talk to me.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.846
But I think you're gonna
need some of that...

10:12.880 --> 10:15.916
emotional stuff Dr. Phil's
always talking about.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.753
The... "You can't fix
a flat tire with a
red-handled hairbrush."

10:19.787 --> 10:21.254
Nah, that's not it.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.756
Ma! Dad!

10:22.790 --> 10:25.092
Check out the moves
I just taught Hope

10:25.125 --> 10:26.827
for the father-daughter dance!

10:26.860 --> 10:28.796
Ya-ta... holla...

10:28.829 --> 10:30.163
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.866
How is she supposed to ever
learn to dance on her own?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.535
What the hell kind of father
smothers his daughter like that?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.270
BURT:
Virginia, you're
obviously upset.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.540
"I don't always drink
beer, but when I do..."

10:40.573 --> 10:43.643
(sighs) Nah, that's
not Dr. Phil.
And for God's sake,

10:43.677 --> 10:46.546
you're letting
all the bugs in.
Close the door.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.715
Closure-- that's it!

10:47.748 --> 10:49.850
You got to go meet
your dad for closure.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.152
(sighs)
Fine, I'll go.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.354
But it's not because
I trust Dr. Phil.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.724
It's 'cause that closure thing
always seems to work

10:56.757 --> 10:58.091
on Grey's Anatomy.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.563
Oh, my hand's shaking.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.066
I haven't been this nervous
since Jimmy was born.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.235
At least I had cigarettes
to get me through that.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.703
Don't be nervous.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.371
Just picture your dad
in his underwear.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.806
Burt, I've never met the man.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.842
I don't know what sort of
underwear he wears.

11:16.009 --> 11:16.977
Oh, uh...

11:17.010 --> 11:18.645
No, sorry,
no, uh...

11:18.678 --> 11:21.381
no housekeeping or
lawn care today.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.483
Assuming that's
what you do.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.919
Cut the crap.
I know who you are

11:25.953 --> 11:28.655
and I know what you've been
doing all these years,

11:28.688 --> 11:30.323
and it needs
to stop.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.725
Stay away
from my family...
Okay.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.727
...and delete all those
creepy pictures of us.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.996
And then I want
you to go away

11:36.029 --> 11:37.164
and never come
near us again.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.331
Right.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.499
Right after
you tell me

11:39.532 --> 11:41.668
what possible reason
a person could have

11:41.701 --> 11:43.436
to abandon
his precious baby girl.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.539
I'm gay.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.243
I'm confused.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.279
So was I, back then.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.881
You see, it all
started backstage

11:53.914 --> 11:55.916
after a dinner theater
performance of Pippin.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.050
I played Pippin,

11:57.084 --> 11:59.419
local critic said
I was "mesmerizing."

11:59.452 --> 12:00.888
After the
cast party,

12:00.921 --> 12:04.124
your mom, me, and a
bottle of apple wine--

12:04.157 --> 12:07.127
we, uh, made our way
into the, uh, prop closet.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.528
(whispering):
Virginia, that's probably
where you get

12:08.561 --> 12:09.830
your love
of fruit-based alcohol.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.533
Pretending to enjoy
sex with a woman

12:13.566 --> 12:17.204
was perhaps my second great
performance that evening.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.538
Your mom got pregnant,

12:18.571 --> 12:19.706
and I got...

12:19.739 --> 12:22.709
I got the guts to admit
that I am gay.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.377
I wanted
to stay,

12:24.411 --> 12:27.547
but no, the-the people
of Natesville in 1973,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.483
they did not want to be
associated with, uh,

12:30.517 --> 12:31.819
"my kind."

12:31.852 --> 12:34.221
That's what Maw Maw
was talking about.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.722
She hates you.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.225
Yeah, Paw Paw wasn't
so thrilled either.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.659
You ever tried
dodging buckshot

12:39.692 --> 12:41.094
in cashmere
bell-bottoms?

12:41.128 --> 12:42.395
I can only imagine.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.464
I did it in jean shorts
and that wasn't easy.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.967
I am so sorry.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.735
It wasn't your fault.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.170
Was my fault.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.771
I didn't want
you to grow up

12:51.805 --> 12:53.406
with the stigma of
having a gay father.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.476
I can only hope
you'll forgive me.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.311
Daddy!

12:58.345 --> 12:59.646
JIMMY:
Once my mom understood
why her dad had left,

12:59.679 --> 13:01.781
it was hard to stay mad at him.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.084
And they both wanted
to make up for lost time

13:04.117 --> 13:06.619
doing all those father-daughter
things they missed out on.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.692
MAN:
Vos mamelons sont
comme des roues de Brie.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.094
He said...

13:14.127 --> 13:15.762
(whispering)

13:15.795 --> 13:17.764
(laughs)

13:17.797 --> 13:18.999
What'd he say?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.868
(woman speaking French)

13:21.869 --> 13:23.871
(bicycle horn squeaking)

13:38.318 --> 13:39.619
Oh...

13:39.652 --> 13:41.121
I was really looking forward
to taco night.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.522
Oh, come on, Burt.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.957
Your palate is so pedestrian.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.358
Why don't you try something new?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.861
Sushi is the taco
of the Far East.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.762
Now, look.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.299
You've got your protein,

13:52.332 --> 13:53.901
you've got your rice,

13:53.934 --> 13:56.236
and instead of a corn tortilla,

13:56.269 --> 13:57.470
it's all wrapped

13:57.504 --> 13:59.539
in a delicious piece of mori.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.976
If you ignore-i what it's
made of, it tastes pretty good.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.012
(chuckles)

14:06.213 --> 14:07.847
How is that
sea urchin, Burt?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.851
It's like the ocean sneezed
in my mouth.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.255
You know, all those years
I've been following you guys

14:15.288 --> 14:18.191
around with a camera,
and I feel like I've just walked

14:18.225 --> 14:19.226
right into the picture.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.929
You know, we should
have a family photo.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.331
I love family photos.
With a theme.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.766
I love family photos
with themes!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.269
(sobbing quietly)

14:30.603 --> 14:31.671
This is amazing.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.839
I love costumes.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.407
Oh, boy, do I
have a parade

14:34.441 --> 14:35.842
to take you to
next summer.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.178
This is gonna be
the best family photo ever.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.213
Virginia, I gotta talk to you.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.017
Isn't this the cat's pajamas?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.285
Yes.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.120
But only because I think
cat's pajamas are stupid.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.421
I look like
an idiot

14:48.455 --> 14:50.023
in this thing
your dad picked out.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.024
Oh, come on, Burt.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.025
This is fun.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.260
No, it's not fun.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.228
Nothing's been fun
since Arnold showed up.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.064
Are you jealous

14:57.097 --> 14:58.565
because I'm spending time
with my dad?

14:58.598 --> 15:00.300
No. But I just know that

15:00.333 --> 15:01.534
he doesn't like the way I act

15:01.568 --> 15:03.403
or what I say
or what I like to eat.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.737
He doesn't like anything
about me.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.539
So what do you want me to do?

15:06.573 --> 15:07.707
He's my father.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.209
Am I supposed
to not see him anymore?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.810
I didn't say that.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.580
I just would like him to go away
and never come back.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.149
He makes me
uncomfortable, Virginia.

15:16.183 --> 15:17.584
He's just too
different than us.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.387
Wish I could say I was surprised

15:20.420 --> 15:21.754
to hear that kind of intolerance

15:21.788 --> 15:22.990
from someone in this town.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.724
(gasps)

15:24.757 --> 15:26.493
He's right behind
me, isn't he?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.595
Burt, that only works
if he hasn't said anything.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.803
Sorry to be so different
from you, Burt.

15:36.836 --> 15:37.837
Obviously

15:37.870 --> 15:40.473
your husband doesn't approve
of my lifestyle.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.508
No, no.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.742
Honestly,
I didn't mean that.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.677
It's just that
everything you like to do

15:44.711 --> 15:46.413
makes me
uncomfortable or sick.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.847
(sighs)

15:47.880 --> 15:49.916
Trying to be a part of your life
was clearly a mistake.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.185
I'm not one for melodrama, so...

15:52.219 --> 15:55.422
good-bye forever.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.589
Burt...

15:56.623 --> 15:58.358
I just got my dad back,

15:58.391 --> 15:59.926
and now you drove him away.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.094
I can fix this.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.462
Like when I broke
your favorite mug.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.764
The mug that makes me dizzy
every time I drink from it?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.099
Good point.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.934
I promise I will not use
the same toxic glue

16:07.967 --> 16:08.968
to fix your dad.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.640
JIMMY:
Dad felt so bad

16:13.673 --> 16:15.142
about what happened
with Grandpa Arnold

16:15.175 --> 16:17.110
that he not only posed
for the family picture,

16:17.144 --> 16:18.645
he decided to throw a party

16:18.678 --> 16:20.647
so the rest of Natesville
could welcome Arnold home.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.115
* For he's a jolly gay fellow

16:22.149 --> 16:25.785
* For he's a jolly
gay fellow... *

16:25.818 --> 16:27.487
I forgive you, Natesville.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.289
* Which nobody can deny.

16:29.322 --> 16:33.960
And then I left a...
a tenured position

16:33.993 --> 16:36.796
to become a freelance
ethnomusicologist.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.699
I once saw a man
in a small African village

16:39.732 --> 16:41.801
who could perform
an entire symphony

16:41.834 --> 16:44.371
using nothing but a rock
and a human tooth.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.139
Ah...
Oh!
Was it amazing?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.208
Oh, no, it was...
it was excruciating.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.310
(laughing)

16:50.343 --> 16:52.545
ARNOLD:
But you had to admire
the effort, right?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.381
He's been all
over the world.
Even Canada.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.982
Do your Canadian accent, Dad.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.417
Virginia's my daughter, eh?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.652
(laughing)

16:59.686 --> 17:01.020
It's like we're
at a hockey game.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.323
This my birthday or my wake?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.724
Go get her back inside.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.993
I don't want her to see my
father and start gay-bashing.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.195
Okay.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.762
It's your wake and you're early.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.164
Let's get you back inside.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.834
What the hell is that depraved
son of a bitch doing here?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.369
He's my father,

17:16.403 --> 17:18.037
and I invited him here.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.372
This is still my house,

17:19.406 --> 17:21.508
and I don't want
that kind of disgusting,

17:21.541 --> 17:22.942
immoral, deviant...

17:22.975 --> 17:24.844
ALL:
Oh!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.880
Maw Maw, you can't say
stuff like that anymore.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.383
Okay? It's 2013.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.120
Damn it, this life
is taking forever.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.887
Look...

17:34.921 --> 17:37.290
we all accept my dad
for who he is.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.327
Nobody in Natesville cares
anymore that he's gay.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.929
He's gay?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.364
Well, I don't have a problem
with gays.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.199
I mean, Jimmy's gay,
and I love him

17:46.233 --> 17:47.367
and his little husband.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.535
Oh, that's the
nicest thing

17:48.568 --> 17:49.702
she's ever
said to me.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.703
But that guy?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.539
He's a first-class narcissist.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.441
Oh, "narcissist."

17:54.474 --> 17:56.276
I think we know
what that's code for.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.544
You fall asleep
in the middle
of sentences?

17:57.577 --> 17:59.479
He's a selfish jerk.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.813
He doesn't care
about anybody but himself.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.749
That's why he left you
and your mother.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.217
He didn't leave.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.785
He was run out of town.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.053
Right?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.388
Well, "run out of town,"

18:08.421 --> 18:09.889
"made to feel unwelcome,

18:09.922 --> 18:12.225
unappreciated..."
same diff.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.560
I don't think it
really is the same.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.894
That's easy for you to say.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.096
You try being gay
and raising a child

18:17.130 --> 18:19.566
in this town in the '70s.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.067
BARNEY:
You know, now that
you mention it...

18:21.100 --> 18:23.836
my lesbian mothers raised me
in this town in the '70s.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.938
Sure, one of them had
to dress up like a man

18:25.972 --> 18:27.440
to take me on
the father-son canoe trip,

18:27.474 --> 18:29.242
but they toughed it out.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.077
It didn't hurt that
she already had a mustache

18:31.110 --> 18:32.679
and a closet
full of flannels.

18:32.712 --> 18:33.746
Lesbians.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.582
Everybody loves lesbians.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.417
You could've at least
written her a letter.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.352
Or not even a phone call?

18:39.386 --> 18:41.421
They had phones in the '70s.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.422
Right?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.590
Yep.
Right.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.926
Um, the phone company
and-and gay people...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.661
You're clearly using
your homosexuality

18:48.695 --> 18:49.996
as an excuse

18:50.029 --> 18:51.998
to cover up for your refusal

18:52.031 --> 18:54.000
to accept your parental
responsibilities.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.535
By the way,
we haven't met.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.103
I'm Frank.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.171
It's a pleasure.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.207
Once again,
the haters of Natesville

19:00.240 --> 19:01.608
rear their ugly heads.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.975
You know, you people
are very interesting,

19:03.009 --> 19:04.844
because you don't seem to be
able to change, do you?

19:04.877 --> 19:06.946
Maybe you're the one
who hasn't changed.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.849
'Cause now that
I'm thinking about it,

19:09.882 --> 19:11.117
everything that
we've done this week

19:11.150 --> 19:12.952
has been something
you wanted to do.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.688
We had that sushi dinner
'cause you wanted it.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.689
You suggested
Taco Tuesday.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.191
Do you honestly
expect me

19:18.225 --> 19:20.960
to eat the street food
of a migrant people?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.230
We went to that French movie
'cause you picked it.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.131
Already saw the
Swedish version.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.734
And you insisted

19:27.767 --> 19:29.736
on the theme for
our family picture.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.472
Because I wanted to
share it with my friends.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.840
Don't you understand?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.141
Do you honestly expect me

19:35.174 --> 19:37.644
to show a photo
of-of you guys

19:37.677 --> 19:39.646
dressed the way
you normally do?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.349
Forgive me for trying
to raise you to a higher level.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.318
Wow.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.487
I think you should leave...

19:47.520 --> 19:48.521
again.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.058
But this time, it's my choice.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.396
Good-bye forever.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.499
(clears throat)

19:59.532 --> 20:02.769
I'm gonna take this
because I look fantastic.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.373
Oh...

20:07.540 --> 20:10.510
* Sometimes your dad's
not here *

20:10.543 --> 20:12.345
* Sometimes your dad's
a big selfish... *

20:12.379 --> 20:13.846
Quit it, Shelley.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.283
(film projector whirring)

20:16.316 --> 20:19.686
JIMMY:
Dad invited everyone over that
night to meet Mom's father.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.589
But in the end, it turned out
they already knew her father,

20:22.622 --> 20:25.492
because Paw Paw
was Mom's real dad.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.436
I'm sorry
your gay father

20:36.469 --> 20:39.872
turned out to be
a narcissist.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.441
You okay?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.875
Yeah.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.311
The truth is,

20:44.344 --> 20:47.046
I had a pretty good
father figure.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.715
And I guess it's
good Arnold left

20:48.748 --> 20:50.116
when I was a baby.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.384
Think of all
the macaroni art

20:51.418 --> 20:53.653
I would have wasted
on that guy.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.787
Finger-paintings.

20:54.821 --> 20:55.788
Ashtrays.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.956
Ugly ties.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.425
He probably would've
given me zero stars

20:58.458 --> 21:00.460
on the Father's Day
breakfast I made him.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.330
And besides...

21:03.363 --> 21:05.332
if I didn't have
some daddy issues,

21:05.365 --> 21:08.401
I might not have got
knocked up at 15.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.337
Then where would I be?
