00:01.200 --> 00:03.520
PREVIOUSLY

00:03.840 --> 00:05.360
The police are looking for you.

00:05.560 --> 00:08.200
I want to go where my accident happened,
then I'll go back.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.760
You took an overdose and
only just pulled through.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.400
I would like some information regarding
my treatment by Dr Mommaerts.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.160
Oh, Mie.
- Not all of them.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.120
Here.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.680
MEDICAL RECORDS
ANNEMIE D'HAEZE

00:22.880 --> 00:24.600
Vronsky.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.120
Goddammit.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.040
You're a dirty rat.
Vronsky the rat.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.680
Only one lunatic in here rips pages
out of books and that's you.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.040
Bob.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.400
I met Benoit at a premiere,
he was there with Veronique.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.280
He finished with her first
before he started seeing me.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.040
I'll tell you what happened.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.600
While my daughter suffered from depression
because she was at her wit's end with Romy

01:00.800 --> 01:05.160
and sir here had to go and fuck his ex.
- Yes, that happened.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.720
I had nothing more to do with Veronique
from then on.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.640
CALL ME XXX V.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.600
I want to leave. With you.
- OK.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.640
Back here at 4 o'clock.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.560
Benoit, I'm leaving you.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.080
You have to remember
what happened to that Thomas Spectre.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.000
He's the drunk
who drove into your car, Mie.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.960
We cannot tear out
a single page of our life,

02:42.160 --> 02:45.200
but we can throw the whole book
in the fire.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.920
George Sand.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.560
TODAY
13 DECEMBER

03:22.560 --> 03:23.920
Mie?

03:30.280 --> 03:32.920
How are you doing?
- OK.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.280
Mie, Jan Peeters died in hospital
this morning.

03:36.720 --> 03:37.760
Who's he?

03:38.440 --> 03:42.080
Vronsky.
- The patient with the split personality.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.360
But you only knew him as Vronsky.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.440
Where did you get that?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.920
He gave it to me.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.680
And... how did he get hold of
that model airplane and the methanol?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.480
I don't know.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.920
Mr Peeters didn't have any visitors.
Nor did Vronsky.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.800
You had a good relationship with him, eh?
- Inspector Wolkers visited him.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.800
Would he give an inflammable toy
to a pyromaniac?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.440
He must have had matches too.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.800
Did he get those
from the inspector as well?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.440
I don't know.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.840
Then we'll have to ask
the inspector himself, won't we?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.480
I don't retire till tomorrow.
- No, Jacques, it stops here.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.280
I have the right to finish my case,
don't I? Dammit.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.480
You're stuck, Jacques.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.720
And not just in your case.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.640
We took the husband's complaint seriously.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.600
I've also taken the time
to look at your case.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.480
It's not ethical, goddammit.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.960
I suppose he got his good looks
from his mum?

05:14.160 --> 05:19.240
You know the rules. Covering up personal
involvement means immediate suspension.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.320
And I'd prefer it if we can ensure
your career doesn't end with a blemish.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.240
Right, come on. E1 to H1.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.480
24 more hours.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.200
No, no, no.
We are going to do it by the book.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.120
You do remember
how you ended up on that chair, eh?

05:46.320 --> 05:50.520
And I'm very grateful to you.
I'm just trying to protect you.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.680
You're not going to deter me.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.680
A2 to A1.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.800
Stalemate.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.320
Here, your leaving gift.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.840
From your own party that you missed.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.760
It may come in handy.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.640
24 hours.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.240
Use them well.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.320
Inspector? Inspector, a quick word
about Jan Peeters' death?

06:42.520 --> 06:43.880
A very unfortunate affair.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.720
He wasn't the first to take his own life
here but the way he did it...

06:47.920 --> 06:52.240
What mainly worries us is how he got hold
of that model airplane and the matches.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.720
Model airplane?
What has that got to do with it?

06:54.920 --> 06:58.400
It used methanol. It's highly inflammable.
- I know what methanol is.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.200
Shouldn't you be more worried about
Annemie D'Haeze being able to escape?

07:04.440 --> 07:06.560
And now you'll have to excuse me.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.040
I have a disappearance to solve
and other things to worry about

07:10.240 --> 07:13.600
than some sad lunatic
who barbecued himself.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.920
Well? Why did we run away?

07:25.520 --> 07:28.200
I've heard the terrible news
about your friend.

07:28.880 --> 07:32.000
Come on, Mie. Why did we run away?

07:32.640 --> 07:34.680
I had to see
where your son and my daughter...

07:34.880 --> 07:37.440
We've had that conversation already, Mie.

07:37.800 --> 07:41.200
And my relationship with my son
has nothing to do with this.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.520
You're looking for a scapegoat.
- And you have a motive.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.720
I'm not the only one.
- That's true.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.000
But your husband was at work.
His colleagues have confirmed that again.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.120
And he wasn't the last person
seen with Thomas, Mie.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.080
That's Bob.
- Bob?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.240
Yes.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.120
I'm Gust.

08:46.880 --> 08:49.440
Why do you say Bob?
- The gamekeeper.

08:49.640 --> 08:53.040
Yes, the gamekeeper.
He found you in the woods.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.040
Sit down, Gust. Sit down.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.280
Tell me what you saw.

09:06.240 --> 09:12.440
First I saw the young lady go into
the woods and a bit later Mr Spectre.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.920
Together? You saw them together?

09:15.240 --> 09:18.760
Yes. Earlier in the day.
In that little chalet.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.880
I think they often met up there.

09:23.080 --> 09:27.080
What happened there?
What did they do?

09:31.840 --> 09:33.080
They had sex there?

09:36.120 --> 09:40.920
Then what? What happened afterwards?
Did they leave together?

09:41.320 --> 09:46.440
No. I didn't see the man again that day.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.480
But I did see the young lady.
Later in the woods.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.320
Completely exhausted. Covered in blood.
In a right state.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.120
I knew where she lived.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.320
Of course you know where I live.
You've been watching me for months.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.200
Carry on, Gust.

10:08.400 --> 10:12.200
I tried to calm her down
and took her home.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.240
That's true. Your mother confirmed that.
She was at your house.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.600
And then a few days later
I saw that missing person notice.

10:22.800 --> 10:27.800
So I called the police immediately.
- This isn't Gust.

10:28.760 --> 10:33.160
He's lying. This is Bob. His name is Bob
and he's trying to trick me.

10:33.760 --> 10:38.280
He is. Can't you see through him?
Can't you see through his little game?

10:38.480 --> 10:41.800
Of course he came forward as a witness.
I told you, he knows all about me.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.560
He hangs around my house. He knows
everything, he knows about my amnesia.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.280
He knows about Romy. He knows about
my husband and Tom, where we meet.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.840
He knows everything. He killed Tom.
And you're trying to blame it on me.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.680
Miss.
- Look at his jacket. There's blood on it.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.560
Calm down. Calm down.
- No. Don't.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.000
Calm down.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.400
Gust, Gust.
Tell me, Mie.

11:05.600 --> 11:09.080
He's done something terrible to Tom...
You have to... Let go of me.

11:09.280 --> 11:13.120
He's... He's got a cabin in the woods.
Let go of me. You have to check it.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.840
He did it. He killed Tom.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.920
Calm down, calm down.
- Let go of me. No, don't touch me.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.120
TODAY
14 DECEMBER

12:26.200 --> 12:27.320
Hello, Mie.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.240
Hi.
- I need something to write with.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.840
What?
- Something to write with.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.760
Hurry up... Hurry up...

12:42.320 --> 12:43.760
Here you are.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.400
Did they put you in here
because you ran away?

13:00.120 --> 13:02.320
Wolkers was right.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.520
That Bob isn't the gamekeeper.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.720
The Bob in my dream isn't a person.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.720
I have to take Mrs D'Haeze
back to her room.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.320
Right.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.320
But we've searched these woods already,
haven't we?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.960
Uh, chief. We've already done this once.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.760
Fed up with your job, Meulemans? You can
go and issue parking tickets, if you want.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.720
May I stay a while longer? I'm her doctor.
- I want her to stay.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.080
Mie, what is this?

14:03.680 --> 14:06.360
There was someone else.
- Where?

14:06.560 --> 14:11.440
At my accident. There was someone
with a key ring like that.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.920
A paramedic or a fireman.
- No, no, no. Before that.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.160
Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure. I saw it.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.080
In my dream.
- A dream?

14:23.280 --> 14:28.680
No, it was... It was more than a dream.
I remember it.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.840
Yes, but... how we remember things
is almost never how it really happened,

14:33.040 --> 14:35.280
certainly not in the case of
people with amnesia.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.040
The doctors did warn you
about confabulations.

14:39.240 --> 14:44.040
People who lose their memory often
try to fill the gaps with a fantasy.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.520
Romy was a fantasy for a long time.
- No, it's more than a fantasy.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.920
I'm telling you, they are trying to
trick me. They want to keep me here.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.440
Mie, your paranoia is destroying
everyone around you.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.480
Your mother, Benoit, yourself.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.880
You have to help me.
I have to get out of here.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.640
I want to help you, I really do, but you
are focussing too much on the accident,

15:07.840 --> 15:12.440
you should concentrate on Thomas Spectre.
- But the two are connected.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.920
Jonas.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.720
Fuck.

15:33.600 --> 15:38.040
Mie, come on... You slept with Thomas,
the man who killed your child.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.600
What did you do
after you found that out?

15:41.280 --> 15:43.120
I don't know.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.640
Try to go back to those feelings.
It will help you remember.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.520
Mie, you had sex with the man
who killed your daughter.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.840
But I didn't know.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.040
You have to remember.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.840
Now is the time. There is no other way.
You have to do it.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.160
Thomas Spectre is the drunk...

16:06.360 --> 16:07.640
DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE

16:07.840 --> 16:09.920
... who drove into your car, Mie.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.640
Go and fuck our daughter's killer.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.320
HALF, NO MORE
SLEEP WELL XXX

17:26.960 --> 17:28.440
You're here.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.600
Put that photo away.
I know who you are.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.280
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.280
Me too.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.760
You haven't got much with you.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.240
I don't need much.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.880
To us?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.280
I'm going to make you happy, Mie.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.120
Are you going to make me happy?

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
Mie.
- Don't say my name.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.680
What else are you going to tell me? Eh?

19:12.360 --> 19:17.240
That it wasn't on purpose?
That you didn't kill my child on purpose?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.360
Why did you come looking for me?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.400
Why?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.600
Why did you start following me?

19:36.040 --> 19:38.400
You just screwed me over, you did.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.720
You took everything away from me.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.520
I couldn't help it.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.640
You suddenly turned up at the...
recycling centre.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.320
You didn't recognise me.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.040
I wanted to know if you were OK.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.720
You should've left me alone.

20:18.640 --> 20:19.960
I wanted...

20:20.800 --> 20:22.600
I was given a second chance...

20:23.800 --> 20:25.760
to make amends.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.440
For the first time since the accident

20:37.200 --> 20:38.920
I felt a sort of...

20:39.960 --> 20:41.320
peace...

20:42.720 --> 20:44.200
when you looked at me.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.440
I tried to fight it but...

20:50.800 --> 20:54.000
You felt it too.
- No. Don't say that.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.400
It was real.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.880
I'm sorry, Mie.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.680
I'm sorry that I killed your child.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.960
I love you, Mie.
- Don't say that.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.440
Mie.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.440
Mie.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.280
Mie.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.280
TODAY
14 DECEMBER

22:45.480 --> 22:48.960
How long have I been here?
- About ten days.

22:49.960 --> 22:55.480
Then he's been there more than a week.
- Mie? Mie, take it easy. No, sit down.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.640
What's the matter?

23:02.560 --> 23:04.240
I forgot about him.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.640
I shut him in the cellar of the cabin
in the woods and he's still there.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.000
OK.
You'll have to call Inspector Wolkers.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.920
I can't do that.
I have a duty of confidentiality.

23:18.120 --> 23:22.920
The sooner you tell him, the more chance
there is of Thomas being found alive.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.440
And?
- Just animal remains.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.360
No human remains.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.400
Are you sure?
- Yes.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.720
Wolkers?

23:59.840 --> 24:01.320
Mrs D'Haeze?

24:06.360 --> 24:07.400
Cabin in the woods, now!

24:20.800 --> 24:23.000
Do you still remember your dream?

24:24.320 --> 24:27.040
About forgetting about your rabbit
in the cellar?

24:29.600 --> 24:31.520
Dreams are strange things.

24:32.520 --> 24:36.120
They're the only place
where we can talk to our subconscious.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.400
What have I done?

24:48.160 --> 24:49.880
Oh, the letters.

24:50.720 --> 24:51.680
Letters?

24:51.880 --> 24:54.840
I probably wrote
all these letters myself too.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.920
I'M SORRY

24:59.120 --> 25:02.120
You wanted to tell yourself what you did.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.440
Beware the wolf in sheep's clothing.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.880
Their lies are so powerful
that eyes become blind.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.440
You were right.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.760
There wasn't anyone else.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.800
It's all in my head.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.400
Move that sofa.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.000
Goddammit.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.520
Christ, what a stench!

25:48.280 --> 25:51.000
Mie, is it OK
if I take my phone back?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.800
Thank you.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.240
We can carry on seeing each other,
if you want.

26:10.760 --> 26:15.400
Excuse me, the police have asked us
to put Mie in isolation so...

26:15.600 --> 26:20.200
I'm going to take this too.
I'll keep it for you, Mie.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.640
You don't need to worry
and you can stay in your room,

26:23.840 --> 26:27.240
but no visitors for now.
Until there is more news.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.840
I understand.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.000
It'll all be fine.

27:31.240 --> 27:34.000
<i>You have one new message.</i>

27:34.200 --> 27:38.400
<i>Hello, Mrs D'Haeze, St Anthony's here.
About your hospital treatment,</i>

27:38.600 --> 27:42.120
<i>you were treated during that period
by psychiatrist Dr Mommaerts.</i>

27:42.320 --> 27:45.840
<i>You were his last patient.
The man has since retired.</i>

27:46.040 --> 27:48.280
I hope that...
- Message deleted.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.120
<i>You have listened to all new messages.</i>

28:11.640 --> 28:17.720

28:36.760 --> 28:41.600
Hi, Benoit, this is Veronique.
Can you call me back, please? Bye.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.120
Hi. Veronique.
- Hi.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.040
How are you?

29:06.160 --> 29:07.280
Are you still cross?

29:07.480 --> 29:11.560
No, it's a long time ago. But
you could've invited me to your wedding.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.520
I thought you may've still been hurt
at the time and...

29:14.720 --> 29:17.480
How are you?
- I've got a little girl now.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.320
Are you happy?
- Yes.

29:20.520 --> 29:25.640
Well, our Romy isn't an easy child
and Mie finds it hard to cope.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.360
She's got depression.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.400
I miss you.

30:03.720 --> 30:08.120
LAST FEBRUARY

30:09.280 --> 30:13.520
My mother-in-law saw us.
I need to make a decision. I have to...

30:13.720 --> 30:15.000
I have to choose.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.720
Choose us, Benoit.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.320
Hi.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.320
Veronique...

30:31.120 --> 30:32.640
Sorry, but I'm not coming.

30:32.840 --> 30:37.040
What do you mean, you're not coming?
- That... I'm not coming.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.760
Benoit, we arranged to meet
to decide what we would do.

30:41.960 --> 30:47.040
Veronique, Mie took an overdose of
sleeping pills yesterday.

30:49.000 --> 30:54.560
This... We can't see each other anymore.
We can't. I have to choose my family.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.280
Sorry.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.160
He's left me for that bitch again.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.320
Mie has taken my life away from me.

31:17.520 --> 31:21.360
I should've been on that stage and not
in the fucking courtroom like my father.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.760
I should wake up
next to Benoit every morning.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.320
Why didn't she take enough pills?

31:29.480 --> 31:31.120
Benoit is mine.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.160
Mine.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.880
He is the only one
I have ever really loved.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.280
Apart from Daniël, your little brother?
- He has nothing to do with it.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.080
Daniël is dead, Benoit is alive.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.480
Your happiness shouldn't depend on others.

31:44.680 --> 31:48.520
We are all the architects of
our own happiness.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.800
We have to take control of it ourselves.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.920
Is anyone sitting here?

33:25.400 --> 33:29.120
Is anyone waiting for you at home?
- My cat.

33:32.120 --> 33:35.320
You've got beautiful eyes.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.400
Did you come by car?
- By car.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.640
Weren't we going to have sex?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.640
Professional.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.960
Do you come here often?

35:04.560 --> 35:09.160
I'm glad Grandma Lola is ill.
- That's not a very nice thing to say.

35:09.760 --> 35:14.160
Because then I can come with you.
Your rehearsals are fun.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.800
But we have an agreement.
- Yeah...

35:19.000 --> 35:22.280
Seriously. Otherwise it's the last time
you go to work with Mummy.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.840
Yeah...

35:26.400 --> 35:29.720
Oh, Mummy... Can we play a game?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.280
I'm going on a trip and I'm taking...

35:33.040 --> 35:34.120
a flannel.

35:49.920 --> 35:54.160
Sit back in the seat. Put your belt on.
- And my spotty dress.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.680
Sit back down.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.800
Mr Bear.
- I said sit back down.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.040
Clean knickers.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.480
Sit back down. This is the last time.
Sit back down. Put your belt on.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.520
Come on.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.040
Come on.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.440
Fuck.

37:06.800 --> 37:11.000
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

38:00.280 --> 38:03.720
Hello?
- Hi, Benoit. It's Veronique.

38:03.920 --> 38:06.920
It has been so long,
I just wanted to hear your voice again.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.320
I miss you.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.360
Veronique,
now really isn't the time, OK?

38:12.720 --> 38:14.240
What's the matter?

38:17.520 --> 38:21.240
Mie had an accident yesterday and Romy...

38:22.920 --> 38:25.000
My daughter is dead, Veronique.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.480
Oh, that's terrible, Benoit.
Is Mie OK?

38:30.160 --> 38:33.760
Yes, Mie is... Mie is stable.
Mie will pull through.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.520
Is there anything I can do?
- No, Veronique, no.

38:38.720 --> 38:43.920
You really need to leave us alone now, OK?
Mie needs me now.

38:48.720 --> 38:53.600
LAST MARCH -APRIL - MAY - JUNE -
JULY - AUGUST - SEPTEMBER

38:53.800 --> 38:58.440
Once the fire insurance has paid out,
we'll move back to the city, honeybird.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.360
Romy, get back in the car,
Mummy is trying to open the gate.

39:18.600 --> 39:19.840
<i>Close door.</i>

39:20.040 --> 39:23.360

- Close door.

<i>Close door.</i>

39:27.880 --> 39:30.000
Close door.
<i>- Hello, Mie speaking.</i>

39:34.040 --> 39:35.400
Benoit?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.400
Who is it?
- My imagination.

39:40.240 --> 39:41.880
Hello, Benoit speaking.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.280
LAST DECEMBER

39:51.480 --> 39:55.520
He's been missing for 48 hours.
- That crazy woman with amnesia?

39:55.720 --> 39:58.880
In the woods, with that child.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.760
She was picked up and
put in the lunatic asylum.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.280
Really?
- We know what happened there then, eh?

40:09.640 --> 40:11.480
MOVED!

DR T. MOMMAERTS

40:29.000 --> 40:30.800
Dr Mommaerts.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.760
I counselled Mrs D'Haeze
after her car accident last March.

40:34.960 --> 40:38.040
Visits are only allowed
on certain conditions, Doctor.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.680
Because of the police investigation.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.800
Can you just sign here?

40:44.240 --> 40:48.560
You wouldn't be the first patient
to have a nap during my consultation.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.680
TODAY
14 DECEMBER

41:12.960 --> 41:15.760
Hi, Benoit.
- You called.

41:16.640 --> 41:20.760
Why have you been ignoring me?
- Sorry I haven't been in touch.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.240
But I... I...
- Is everything OK, Benoit?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.680
Hold on, no, everything isn't OK.
- What's up?

41:25.880 --> 41:29.080
Nothing's OK. OK? Nothing's OK.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.080
Sorry. Sorry about the texts I sent.
I shouldn't have done that.

41:33.280 --> 41:37.880
Veronique, please!
This isn't about text messages. OK?

41:40.680 --> 41:44.920
The bastard that drove into Mie
has disappeared.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.520
That drunk who is in prison?

41:46.720 --> 41:49.800
He was released in the summer.
Mie contacted him.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.120
Or he did her. Or vice versa.
I don't know.

41:52.320 --> 41:56.600
But Mie has done something to him,
Veronique... The guy is probably dead.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.200
Shit.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.520
I don't really want to bother you
with this but I'm going to need help.

42:02.720 --> 42:06.960
You're the only one I can still trust
and Mie will need a good lawyer.

42:07.160 --> 42:10.240
OK, hold on, calm down.
I'll come and see you, OK?

42:11.000 --> 42:14.040
Where are you?
- At home.

42:15.480 --> 42:18.680
I'll come there, Benoit.
- Is that a good idea?

42:30.040 --> 42:33.960
Why are you doing this to yourself,
Benoit? You deserve better.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.080
You mustn't say that, Veronique.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.720
I'm telling you,
you have no future with that woman.

42:38.920 --> 42:41.000
It's not that simple.

42:42.720 --> 42:44.760
Mie needs me. OK?

42:46.000 --> 42:51.320
Mie will forget everything as usual and
you'll be left with the mess, on your own.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.280
I can put you in contact with the best
lawyers but Mie will be locked up anyway.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.720
Benoit?

43:00.920 --> 43:04.400
Yeah, yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
- You're entitled to a life too, eh?

43:04.600 --> 43:08.400
I can't just erase everything
and start again. I can't do that.

43:08.600 --> 43:12.080
You can. Yes, you can, Benoit, you can.
Tabula rasa.

43:12.280 --> 43:16.120
Your child is gone. You have nothing left.
Sorry to put it like that but it's true.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.960
I'll come to you and
we'll carry on our chat then, OK?

43:37.160 --> 43:39.640
Jacques?
- Dammit. Please, not now.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.800
All we've got is a hand.
I'm sorry about your son...

43:43.000 --> 43:45.280
We mustn't get ahead of ourselves.
We have to...

43:45.480 --> 43:48.600
We don't have to do anything.
All you have to... Listen a moment.

43:48.800 --> 43:52.080
All you have to do is
think of yourself, OK?

43:52.280 --> 43:55.800
You have officially retired.
The case will be passed on.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.080
Here. I don't want your junk.
- Jacques.

44:23.000 --> 44:23.880
Lunatic.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.120
Must have a tiny dick!

45:32.120 --> 45:33.360
Hello?

45:33.560 --> 45:36.960
I saw you.
- Uh, who is this?

45:37.160 --> 45:39.400
I saw you at the hospital.

45:40.040 --> 45:42.200
Uh, what are you talking about?

45:43.440 --> 45:46.720
It took a while
before I realised who you are.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.520
But I know now.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.280
I saw you.

46:02.200 --> 46:05.800
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you've got the wrong number.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.080
You know who I am, Veronique.
From that bar, remember?

46:13.040 --> 46:15.480
Or would you prefer me
to call you Dr Mommaerts?

46:16.800 --> 46:22.320
Don't worry. This is the first and
last time you'll hear from me.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.240
Be careful.
- Hold on. Hold on.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.160
Did you go and see Mie?

46:28.960 --> 46:30.320
No.

46:31.640 --> 46:35.560
Seeing you there stopped me.

46:37.200 --> 46:43.120
Those letters... that was you.
- Someone had to help Mie.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.720
Fuck.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.120
Fuck, fuck.

47:04.880 --> 47:09.480
Dear Father,
we have never said much to each other,

47:09.680 --> 47:11.760
so I promise to keep it that way.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.520
Mie D'Haeze is innocent.

47:17.040 --> 47:20.880
I've had to carry out
my own investigation in recent days.

47:21.840 --> 47:24.800
You'll find the result with this letter.

47:33.240 --> 47:36.920
I believe in justice but not in courts.

47:39.040 --> 47:43.400
I have to make amends to Mie,
the woman I destroyed.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.920
I now have the chance to save her

47:48.120 --> 47:51.600
and take revenge on
the monster who destroyed my life.

48:15.960 --> 48:20.080
It is the only way to save myself.

48:23.240 --> 48:26.280
I hope you understand
why this is the only solution for me.

48:29.640 --> 48:33.240
Forgive me if I have been
a disappointment as a son.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.800
It may surprise you

48:39.000 --> 48:44.280
but there was a time, when I was
a child, that I looked up to you.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.640
I have always had one good memory of you.

48:50.760 --> 48:53.160
A present I've never thrown away.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.280
I hope you can now do the same.

48:58.960 --> 49:03.360
Always have a good memory of me.

49:30.120 --> 49:33.080
Yes?
- Your mail.

49:34.480 --> 49:37.360
Is there any news from the police?
- Not yet.

49:49.280 --> 49:52.760
A DAY WITHOUT LAUGHTER IS
A DAY WASTED, LOVE MUM

50:02.360 --> 50:05.760
Mie, this is my last letter.

50:05.960 --> 50:09.200
Don't feel guilty.
I was able to free myself.

50:09.400 --> 50:13.920
You are entitled to the truth
but it doesn't always help.

50:14.120 --> 50:19.680
You deserve a new chance with Benoit,
to get on with your life together again.

50:19.880 --> 50:24.560
I once said that being able to forget
seemed like bliss.

50:25.320 --> 50:27.000
The choice is yours.

51:25.760 --> 51:26.640
Hi.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.680
We've been told you are allowed to
go home. That's good, eh?

51:31.160 --> 51:33.200
The police say
the case has been cleared up

51:33.400 --> 51:36.480
and the doctors say
you're getting better, so...

51:37.000 --> 51:38.680
Someone is waiting for you.

52:04.040 --> 52:06.760
Shall we go and put some flowers
on her grave?

52:09.240 --> 52:10.640
I'd like that a lot.
