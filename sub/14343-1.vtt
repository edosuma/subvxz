01:11.800 --> 01:13.600
<i>He was growing into middle age...</i>

01:13.600 --> 01:17.200
<i>and was living then in a bungalow
on Woodland Avenue.</i>

01:19.100 --> 01:21.300
<i>He installed himself in a rocking chair...</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:23.500
<i>and smoked a cigar down
in the evenings...</i>

01:23.700 --> 01:26.600
<i>as his wife wiped her pink hands
on an apron...</i>

01:26.800 --> 01:29.900
<i>and reported happily
on their two children.</i>

01:35.900 --> 01:37.500
<i>His children knew his legs...</i>

01:37.800 --> 01:41.000
<i>the sting of his mustache
against their cheeks.</i>

01:41.800 --> 01:47.000
<i>They didn't know how their father made his living 
or why they so often moved.</i>

01:47.700 --> 01:50.600
<i>They didn't even know their father's name.</i>

01:52.900 --> 01:56.800
<i>He was listed in the city directory
as Thomas Howard.</i>

01:57.000 --> 01:59.400
<i>And he went everywhere unrecognized...</i>

01:59.600 --> 02:02.600
<i>and lunched with Kansas City
shopkeepers and merchants...</i>

02:03.200 --> 02:06.100
<i>calling himself a cattleman
or a commodities investor...</i>

02:07.100 --> 02:10.600
<i>someone rich and leisured
who had the common touch.</i>

02:13.700 --> 02:17.200
<i>He had two incompletely healed
bullet holes in his chest...</i>

02:17.300 --> 02:18.900
<i>and another in his thigh.</i>

02:19.100 --> 02:21.600
<i>He was missing the nub
of his left middle finger...</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:25.000
<i>and was cautious,
lest that mutilation be seen.</i>

02:26.800 --> 02:30.500
<i>He also had a condition that was referred to 
as "granulated eyelids"...</i>

02:30.700 --> 02:33.700
<i>and it caused him to blink 
more than usual...</i>

02:34.500 --> 02:38.600
<i>as if he found creation
slightly more than he could accept.</i>

02:40.200 --> 02:42.800
<i>Rooms seemed hotter
when he was in them.</i>

02:43.300 --> 02:45.000
<i>Rains fell straighter.</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:46.900
<i>Clocks slowed.</i>

02:47.600 --> 02:49.900
<i>Sounds were amplified.</i>

02:51.000 --> 02:53.800
<i>He considered himself
a Southern loyalist and guerrilla...</i>

02:53.900 --> 02:56.900
<i>in a Civil War that never ended.</i>

02:57.100 --> 03:02.400
<i>He regretted neither his robberies,
nor the 17 murders that he laid claim to.</i>

03:09.000 --> 03:13.200
<i>He had seen another summer under
in Kansas City, Missouri...</i>

03:13.400 --> 03:17.700
<i>and on September 5th
in the year 1881...</i>

03:18.800 --> 03:21.500
<i>he was 34 years old.</i>

03:28.300 --> 03:32.200
You just... You just slide them things
right in there, right in your sleeve...

03:32.300 --> 03:35.400
and then, when you get ready,
you just shake it out.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.900
Like that, right there. You shake it out.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.400
Mary Todd Lincoln, tyrant's wife, 
fall into hysterics when the moon was full.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.200
President's men would tie her up
with hay-baling wire...

03:48.300 --> 03:50.500
keep her from ripping
her husband's ears off.

03:50.700 --> 03:55.200
You never heard word one about the wife 
of the Confederacy's Jefferson Davis, did you?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.700
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.800
He did his duty by her.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.700
- Oh, my God, I'm speaking to children.
- No, I get it, I get it, I get it.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.000
The president of the Confederacy discerned
his wife's needs and satisfied them...

04:09.300 --> 04:13.800
with the utmost skill
and the utmost courtesy.

04:15.700 --> 04:19.100
- Charley, you spit all over my boot.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, Jesse.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.200
- Here, get it off.
- I'll wipe it... I'll wipe it off.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.800
But Abraham Lincoln probably sent his wife
on a shopping expedition.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.700
- A three-act play.
- With money stole from us.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.700
Chow!

04:36.500 --> 04:39.600
I think insanity run on both sides
of that Lincoln family.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.600
You're right about that.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.400
The river... 
You jump in the river.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.900
- Chow!
- Don't be shy now, Dick.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.600
- One more piece of meat.
- When you diddle a lot...

04:52.700 --> 04:55.200
There's a good piece of bacon fat
in there for him.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.200
Excuse me.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.300
I see I've traipsed right on in
and interrupted you.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.400
Who are you, then?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.900
Bob Ford.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.500
Charley's brother?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.400
Yeah.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.700
I was lying when I said
I just happened down here.

06:05.900 --> 06:10.200
I've been looking for you. I feel lousy
I didn't say so at the outset.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.300
Folks take me for a nincompoop...

06:14.500 --> 06:18.200
on account of the shabby first impression I make, 
whereas I think of myself...

06:18.400 --> 06:20.800
as being just a rung down
from the James brothers.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.700
I was hoping if I ran into you
aside from those peckerwoods...

06:24.900 --> 06:28.900
I could show you how special I am.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.400
I honestly believe I'm destined
for great things, Mr. James.

06:44.500 --> 06:48.900
I got qualities that don't come shining
through right at the outset.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.700
You give me a chance, I'll get the job done. 
I guarantee you that.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.200
Hey, Dick, is it true you diddled a squaw?

07:04.500 --> 07:08.700
Come on, you can tell me. 
I've always wanted to lay down with a redskin.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.700
Well, Charley...

07:12.200 --> 07:15.600
there's a feeling that comes over you...

07:15.800 --> 07:19.400
getting inside a woman whose hands
has scalped a congregation.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.400
There's this thunderous sound
that comes from their cooch...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.900
on account of the fact 
that they birth a child standing upright...

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
- like a wild animal.
- What's it sound like?

07:29.200 --> 07:33.500
Whatever a thunderous cooch sounds 
like there, Charley. I don't know.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.500
No.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.100
They got a noisy quim
on account of the fact that...

07:38.200 --> 07:43.100
they use their cunnis as a saddlebag
to carry sundries across the plains.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.200
Come on, what'd it really feel like?
Did it feel good?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.800
Come on, fess up, now.

07:49.900 --> 07:51.800
I like you, Charley.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.400
I like you too, Charley.

07:55.900 --> 07:56.900
Well...

07:58.900 --> 08:00.900
You're not so special, Mr. Ford.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.800
You're just like any other tyro
who's prinked himself up for an escapade.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.800
Hoping to be a gunslinger like them 
nickel books are about.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.700
You may as well quench your mind of it...

08:14.900 --> 08:18.000
because you don't have the ingredients, son.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.500
Well, I'm sorry to hear you feel that way...

08:35.700 --> 08:38.900
as I put such stock in your opinions.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.200
As for me being a gunslinger, I've just got
this one granddaddy Paterson Colt...

08:48.300 --> 08:50.800
and a borrowed belt to stick it in.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.300
But I also got an appetite
for greater things.

08:57.500 --> 09:01.600
I hoped by joining up with you, 
it'd put me that much closer to getting them.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.100
Well, what am I supposed to say to that?

09:09.500 --> 09:11.200
Let me be your sidekick tonight.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.500
Sidekick?

09:12.700 --> 09:14.800
So you can examine my grit and intelligence.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.700
I don't know what it is about you...

09:16.900 --> 09:19.900
but the more you talk,
the more you give me the willies.

09:20.400 --> 09:24.000
Now, I don't believe I want you anywhere
within earshot this evening, okay?

09:24.200 --> 09:25.700
You understand?

09:29.800 --> 09:33.200
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Why don't you just get now? Scat.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.500
All right.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.800
I was with a girl once, wasn't a squaw.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.800
But she was pretty.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.600
She had yellow hair like a...

09:55.300 --> 09:57.100
Oh, like something.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.300
Like hair bobbed from a ray of sunlight?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.400
Yeah. Yeah, like that.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.700
Boy, you... 
You talk good.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.600
You can hide things in vocabulary.

10:11.500 --> 10:16.100
Maybe you and me could write her a note,
send it by post?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.000
See, all you gotta do, Ed...

10:18.100 --> 10:21.400
is predict her needs
and beat her to the punch.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.400
Well, this girl, she has a real specific job.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.500
- Specific?
- We was only together once.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.900
She...

10:32.600 --> 10:37.200
She was afraid of lightning,
and she came up under the wagon and...

10:37.300 --> 10:40.300
just cuddled right up to me.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
She give me a kind price too.

10:44.400 --> 10:48.500
Well, I'll be. That is specific.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.500
Yeah, sure,
she'd been with other people...

10:53.700 --> 10:55.700
but the kind of things she said to me...

10:55.900 --> 10:59.000
people just don't say
unless they really mean it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.300
<i>My love said she would marry only me</i>

11:03.100 --> 11:06.200
<i>And Jove himself could not make her care.</i>

11:06.300 --> 11:08.900
<i>For what women say to lovers, you'll agree</i>

11:09.100 --> 11:13.200
<i>One writes on running water or on air.</i>

11:14.700 --> 11:18.300
My God, that's good.
Let's write her that.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.900
No.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.600
Poetry don't work on whores.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.800
How do you do?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.300
Am I too late to wish you a happy birthday?

11:35.900 --> 11:37.100
How'd you know?

11:37.700 --> 11:40.000
You'd be surprised
at what I got stored away.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.700
I'm an authority on the James boys.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.400
Is you?

11:46.100 --> 11:50.600
Well... Well, your brother Frank and I,
we just had a real nice visit.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.900
Just chit-chatting about this and that,
right over there.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.200
And must've been a hundred subjects entertained...

11:58.400 --> 12:00.800
Good Lord, you know what this stew needs?

12:05.500 --> 12:07.100
Dumplings?

12:07.300 --> 12:09.000
Noodles.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.800
You eat yourself some noodle stew
and your clock'll tick all night.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.800
You ever see that woman up in Fayette?
Suck noodles up her nose.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.400
- In Fayette?
- I don't believe I have.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.900
You never heard of her, huh?

12:23.700 --> 12:26.400
You got canals up there
you never dreamed of.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.200
I don't like to harp on a subject...

12:32.400 --> 12:35.000
I don't care who comes with me.
Never have.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.800
That's why they call me gregarious.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.400
I hear you and young Stovepipe here
had a real nice visit.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.900
Your boys have got about a acre of lumber 
to haul, dingus.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.600
You better goose them down yonder.

12:59.800 --> 13:04.000
<i>The James Gang committed over 25 bank,
train and stagecoach robberies...</i>

13:04.200 --> 13:07.700
<i>from 1867 to 1881.</i>

13:08.600 --> 13:10.600
<i>But except for Frank and Jesse James...</i>

13:10.800 --> 13:14.900
<i>all the original members
were now either dead or in prison.</i>

13:15.300 --> 13:19.900
<i>... mine eye
All my soul and all my every part.</i> 

13:20.800 --> 13:23.600
<i>And for this sin, there is no remedy</i>

13:24.300 --> 13:27.100
It is so grounded inward in my heart.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.600
<i>So for their last robbery at Blue Cut...</i>

13:29.700 --> 13:33.300
<i>the brothers recruited a gang
of petty thieves and country rubes...</i>

13:33.500 --> 13:36.200
<i>culled from the local hillsides.</i>

14:52.000 --> 14:54.200
Right on schedule, Buck!

14:56.900 --> 14:59.000
Snuff those lanterns!

14:59.100 --> 15:02.900
Look at those fools. They're gonna trip
and shoot each other into females.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.200
I bet you I could find them husbands
if they do.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
Fan out!

16:56.300 --> 16:58.300
Hold your fire!

17:01.300 --> 17:02.500
- Watch him!
- Going down.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.200
Hold your fire, you idiots!

17:19.400 --> 17:21.500
Hold your fire!

17:31.600 --> 17:33.300
Let me in.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.900
Buck! Boys!

17:36.100 --> 17:38.100
Buck, this way!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.400
Do you think that lock will hold?

17:43.000 --> 17:44.700
No, I don't.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.100
Let's go, let's go.

17:59.300 --> 18:02.700
Let's not get clever, nor courageous,
any of you.

18:15.100 --> 18:18.300
Hey there, boys!
These are all for me?

18:21.100 --> 18:23.600
Looks like Christmas morning in here.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.000
Hey, friend.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.500
You mind if I have a peek around?

18:30.900 --> 18:33.100
This shit. Nope.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.200
Nope.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.200
You got anything good here?

18:40.100 --> 18:41.600
It could be.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.300
Open that safe.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.200
Do it!

19:08.700 --> 19:11.800
- You didn't have to bop him.
- Yeah, he did. They needed convincing.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.400
They got their company rules,
I got my mean streak...

19:14.600 --> 19:17.000
and that's how we get things done around here.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.900
- Get on over here and attend to this thing.
- Come on, go.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.900
Hold your fire, you idiots!

19:29.300 --> 19:31.100
Dig deeper.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.000
- Come on!
- Give me your money.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.100
- And you, stand up.
- Let's see your hands.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.000
What have you got?

19:42.700 --> 19:44.500
Speak English.

19:45.900 --> 19:49.300
Money. Money. You understand that?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.300
Give me your money!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.700
There's some receipts.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.300
I got fives.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.300
Jesse. Jesse.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.600
Don't look good.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.200
There ain't no 100,000 dollars
in here, Dick.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.600
Get down on your knees.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.400
Why?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.100
Well, you ought to pray.

20:41.400 --> 20:42.500
I'm gonna kill you.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.900
Get at!

20:53.700 --> 20:55.500
You're gonna have to make me.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.500
All right.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.100
Don't shoot him! No, don't shoot him.

21:41.800 --> 21:45.100
Don't tell me what I can
and cannot do, Ed.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.900
Round them up!

22:14.000 --> 22:17.800
<i>Chicago newspaper publishers made a great deal 
of the Blue Cut train robbery...</i>

22:17.900 --> 22:19.900
<i>alleging that in no state but Missouri...</i>

22:20.100 --> 22:23.600
<i>would the James brothers be tolerated
for 12 years.</i>

22:24.200 --> 22:25.600
Hey.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.400
Can you keep a secret?

22:30.500 --> 22:33.100
It depends on what you're concealing.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.600
You afraid of the dark?

22:37.500 --> 22:39.000
No.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.600
You superstitious?

22:44.000 --> 22:49.000
I put... I put an acorn in the window
to keep the lightning out.

23:37.500 --> 23:42.200
Kid, you must've crept up on cat's paws.

23:43.100 --> 23:46.600
I'll wager that's the first and last time
you'll ever be caught off-guard.

23:49.800 --> 23:50.900
How old are you?

23:52.300 --> 23:53.700
Twenty.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.100
Except, well, 
I guess I won't really be 20 till...

24:00.600 --> 24:02.800
till January, so...

24:03.600 --> 24:05.500
I'm 19.

24:07.900 --> 24:11.000
Yeah, you feel older than that, though,
don't you?

24:15.800 --> 24:17.600
Yeah, I do.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.900
Hey, Frank, you...
You think the sheriff's out already?

24:36.500 --> 24:39.700
- More than likely.
- Yeah.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.400
I had a real fine time tonight.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.800
- You think so?
- Yup. Yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.100
Hey, I wasn't just flapping my lips
about my kid brother and me.

24:51.500 --> 24:56.100
What I figured was if you and Jesse could gauge 
our courage and our daring...

24:56.300 --> 24:58.500
you might just make us
your regular sidekicks.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.900
Your courage and your daring.

25:02.200 --> 25:07.300
I about heard all I want to about sidekicks.
You sound like your damn brother.

25:07.400 --> 25:11.900
Yeah. Well, I'll be square with you,
it's Bob who put me up to it. He's...

25:12.500 --> 25:15.800
He's got plans for the James boys
I can't even get the hang of.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.800
- They're that complicated.
- Yeah?

25:18.800 --> 25:21.500
Well, you can just get shed of that idea.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.200
Because after tonight,
there'll be no more shenanigans.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.700
You can jot that down in your little diary.

25:27.900 --> 25:32.700
September 7th, 1881, the James Gang
robbed one last train at Blue Cut...

25:32.800 --> 25:35.300
and gave up their nightriding for good.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.500
Wait.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.600
Well, how are you gonna make your living?

25:52.600 --> 25:55.000
Maybe I'll sell shoes.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.900
I can't believe I woke up this morning...

26:07.000 --> 26:10.300
wondering if my daddy
would loan me his overcoat...

26:10.500 --> 26:12.400
and here it is just past midnight...

26:12.500 --> 26:16.100
I've already robbed a railroad train
and I'm sitting in a rocking chair...

26:16.300 --> 26:18.500
chatting with none other than Jesse James.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.900
Yeah, it's a wonderful world.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.100
What's this?

26:32.300 --> 26:34.000
Oh, yeah.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.300
I was real agitated this morning, 
so I was wondering if I would know you or Frank...

26:39.400 --> 26:44.600
tell you all apart, 
and so I had this clipping that described you both.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.800
Want me to read it?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.600
Go on.

26:48.700 --> 26:52.800
Well... 
I gotta find it. Hold on.

26:53.700 --> 26:56.000
Here. Here.

26:56.100 --> 27:00.300
"Jesse James, the youngest, 
has a face as smooth and innocent as a schoolgirl.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.800
The blue eyes, very clear and penetrating,
are never at rest.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.500
His form is tall and graceful
and capable of great endurance...

27:08.700 --> 27:10.100
and great effort.

27:10.300 --> 27:14.300
Jesse is lighthearted, reckless,
and devil-may-care.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.700
- There's always a smile on his lips..."
- All right, all right, all right.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.600
Well, yeah, then it just... Frank, Frank, Frank. 
That's nothing. And then...

27:35.100 --> 27:37.000
You know what I got right next to my bed?

27:37.600 --> 27:42.700
Is The Train Robbers, or, 
A Story of the James Boys by R.W. Stevens.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.800
I mean, many's the night I stayed up...

27:46.200 --> 27:48.400
with my eyes open and my mouth open...

27:48.500 --> 27:51.700
just reading about your escapades
in the Wide Awake Library.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.500
They're all lies, you know.

27:58.900 --> 28:00.900
Yeah, of course they are.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.400
You don't have to keep smoking that
if it's making you bungey.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.600
<i>Alexander Franklin James
would be in Baltimore...</i>

28:33.800 --> 28:37.500
<i>when he would read of the assassination 
of Jesse James.</i>

28:50.900 --> 28:55.500
<i>He had spurned his younger brother
for being peculiar and temperamental.</i>

28:56.900 --> 29:00.200
<i>But once he perceived
that he would never see Jesse again...</i>

29:00.800 --> 29:05.400
<i>Frank would be wrought-up,
perplexed, despondent.</i>

29:44.100 --> 29:47.400
My brother and me are hardly 
on speaking terms these days.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.100
Well, I wasn't gonna mention it.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.000
Are you scared?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.000
No, I'm just surprised a little.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.700
They ain't as succulent as I like,
the devil to clean...

30:08.900 --> 30:11.900
but if a man skins them and fries them 
in garlic and oil...

30:12.100 --> 30:15.000
mercy, them's good eating.

30:15.100 --> 30:18.500
Well, I never been that hungry.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.300
I give them names.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.200
Such as?

30:28.900 --> 30:31.400
Such as enemies.

30:32.300 --> 30:35.100
I give them names of enemies.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.900
Go tell Wood and Charley
to get their gatherings together.

30:52.300 --> 30:53.900
All right.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.900
Me too?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
You can stay.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
All right.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.900
Hey.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.800
- What do you want, peckerwood?
- Nothing.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.600
Except to say Jesse wants you two 
to gather your parts...

31:20.800 --> 31:23.300
get on your horses and get out of town.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.600
And me to stick around.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.100
Well, whoa, I'm his cousin...

31:31.300 --> 31:33.000
I'll have you know.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.300
My mama's his daddy's sister.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.900
Is that how they described it to you, Wood?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.700
You better watch your tongue,
young sapling.

31:41.900 --> 31:45.300
Why is it me who's gotta rattle his hocks
out of town and not you, Bunny?

31:45.400 --> 31:47.200
Put your horns away.
If I know Jess...

31:47.300 --> 31:50.600
there's some real nasty
sad-suzie work's gotta be done...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.800
and Bob's the ninny that has to do it.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.300
Oh, yeah, I'm sure that's it, Charley.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.700
You only met him 12 hours ago.
He doesn't even know your name.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.200
Wood! You tell your daddy
I'll be in Kentucky in October.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.000
We can hunt some birds together.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.000
All right.

32:13.700 --> 32:17.200
So how come it's Bob who gets to stay?

32:19.800 --> 32:22.800
Bob's gonna move my gear to a house
down the street.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.900
See?

32:25.600 --> 32:28.200
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, well.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.400
Sounds like an adventure.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.100
<i>They moved to 1017 Troost Avenue at night...</i>

32:38.300 --> 32:42.800
<i>so that the neighborhood couldn't get
a good look at them or their belongings.</i>

32:44.500 --> 32:47.200
<i>Then Bob thought Jesse
would give him eight hours' sleep...</i>

32:47.300 --> 32:49.700
<i>and a daydreaming goodbye.</i>

32:52.700 --> 32:55.700
<i>But with a second day
in the Thomas Howard house...</i>

32:55.900 --> 32:57.900
<i>Bob thought he might never go...</i>

32:58.800 --> 33:02.600
<i>but might be brought in
as a good-natured cousin to the boy...</i>

33:04.000 --> 33:06.800
<i>and a gentleman helper to Zee.</i>

33:09.800 --> 33:11.500
<i>He went everywhere with Jesse.</i>

33:11.700 --> 33:14.000
<i>They made trips
to the Topeka Exchange Saloon...</i>

33:14.200 --> 33:18.000
<i>where Jesse could spend nearly 60 minutes 
sipping one glass of beer...</i>

33:18.100 --> 33:21.400
<i>and still complain about feeling tipsy.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
<i>Bob would rarely vouchsafe his opinions
as they talked.</i>

33:25.200 --> 33:28.700
<i>If spoken to, he would fidget and grin.</i>

33:29.500 --> 33:33.500
<i>If Jesse palavered with another person,
Bob secretaried their dialogue...</i>

33:33.700 --> 33:37.500
<i>getting each inflection,
reading every gesture and tic...</i>

33:37.600 --> 33:40.800
<i>as if he wanted to compose
a biography of the outlaw...</i>

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
<i>or as if he were preparing an impersonation.</i>

33:59.800 --> 34:01.700
Go away.

34:04.600 --> 34:08.300
Used to be couldn't no one sneak up
on Jesse James.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.000
Now you think otherwise?

34:13.100 --> 34:16.300
I ain't never seen you without your guns, neither.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.900
I can't figure it out.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.900
Do you wanna be like me...

34:35.400 --> 34:36.900
or do you wanna be me?

34:42.800 --> 34:45.000
I'm just making fun, is all.

34:47.699 --> 34:50.900
<i>Bob was sent away cordially the next day...</i>

34:51.100 --> 34:52.600
<i>with a goodbye from Jesse...</i>

34:52.800 --> 34:56.699
<i>but nothing from Zee
beyond what good manners demanded.</i>

35:00.300 --> 35:03.100
<i>It was 40 miles to his sister's farm
from Kansas City.</i>

35:04.400 --> 35:08.700
<i>And it was well into the afternoon
by the time he arrived there.</i>

35:09.700 --> 35:13.800
<i>Mrs. Martha Bolton rented
the Harbison farm in 1879...</i>

35:13.900 --> 35:16.500
<i>just after becoming a widow.</i>

35:17.000 --> 35:19.700
<i>And she made a good income
by giving rooms and meals...</i>

35:19.900 --> 35:25.000
<i>to her brothers Charley, Wilbur and Bob,
and to members of the James Gang...</i>

35:25.200 --> 35:27.700
<i>who would appear
whenever they needed seclusion.</i>

35:27.900 --> 35:29.600
Dick! You're gonna make her sick!

35:29.800 --> 35:32.700
She's gonna upchuck
if you don't watch out!

35:33.300 --> 35:36.500
<i>Wood Hite had been spurned by Martha
in his affections...</i>

35:36.700 --> 35:39.400
<i>and his attempt to switch his pursuit
to her daughter...</i>

35:39.500 --> 35:41.400
<i>was being thwarted by Dick Liddil.</i>

35:41.600 --> 35:44.900
Wait a second, 
you assured me that you were not ticklish.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.100
Howdy!

35:46.300 --> 35:48.100
What's going on, now?
What's going on...?

35:48.300 --> 35:51.100
- Howdy!
- Were you fibbing about that?

35:51.300 --> 35:53.100
- No.
- Not at all.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.300
You're not supposed to peek, Dick.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.900
Well, you're just so pretty
I can't help myself.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.600
- You need to be warning him about that.
- Howdy.

36:01.800 --> 36:05.700
Worry about the field instead,
might be able to worry about the work...

36:05.900 --> 36:07.700
Howdy!

36:08.500 --> 36:11.500
- Finally home.
- I'm so glad, Bob.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.300
I'm in that room too, Bob.
Don't mess with my things.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.500
All right, Grandpa.

36:22.300 --> 36:27.900
"July 9th. Diligence, tact,
and a keen sense of responsibility...

36:28.100 --> 36:32.500
capacity for detail are your dominant traits. 
Your sense of duty's strong."

37:16.800 --> 37:18.400
How long you been there?

37:18.600 --> 37:21.500
Just now arrived. Did I miss much?

37:23.200 --> 37:26.700
Not unless you never seen a man
wash his dirty carcass before.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.300
Boy, you got a big old pecker
for being such a little squirrel.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.500
That what you come here to see, Dick?

37:34.400 --> 37:35.900
No.

37:36.900 --> 37:40.300
Your brother said that Jesse kept you 
in Kansas City some extra days.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.500
What was the reason?

37:43.700 --> 37:47.600
Well, I'm not at liberty to say exactly.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.500
Let me ask you this. Did Jesse mention
that me and Cummins were in cahoots?

37:54.700 --> 37:55.900
Is that so?

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh, dear. I went on and said too much,
have I?

38:00.300 --> 38:02.400
Well, who else is partners with you two?

38:04.800 --> 38:09.300
See, he'll cut our throats if he finds out.
You don't know him like I do.

38:09.500 --> 38:13.400
You do Jesse dirt,
you connive behind his back...

38:13.600 --> 38:16.400
boy, he'll come after you
with a cleaver.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.600
So, what are you two cahoots cooking up?

38:24.600 --> 38:26.300
Don't know that I should say.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.500
I'm not gonna wheedle
the dang news from you.

38:29.700 --> 38:31.500
How about we'll leave it a mystery...

38:31.700 --> 38:35.900
and then we won't neither one of us
regret our little chat?

38:41.700 --> 38:44.400
Can you hand me that six-gun there, Bob?

38:53.500 --> 38:57.600
If you so much as mention my name
to Jesse...

38:57.800 --> 39:00.100
boy, I'll find out about it.

39:00.300 --> 39:03.300
You had better believe that.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.500
And I'll look you up.

39:05.700 --> 39:10.600
I'll knock on your door,
and I will be as mad as a hornet.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.500
I will be hot.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.100
You be careful with that iron, Dick.

39:26.500 --> 39:30.100
You know where I stand on these matters
and that's all there is to it.

39:30.200 --> 39:33.800
Me and you can be as friendly as pigs
from now on.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.800
I'm Bunny Ford, 
stick your hands up in the air!

40:03.000 --> 40:04.700
Mister.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.200
Oh, you have some nerve.

40:13.500 --> 40:18.900
We were just reading about the James boys
among the Mexicans.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.300
What's this? This ain't Jesse.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.600
- You don't know that.
- He would've never wore no mustache.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.100
Never was anywheres near a cannon.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.700
Let me see that picture.

40:31.900 --> 40:34.600
Boy, I can't even calculate
what I'm looking at.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.000
- Give me that.
- Ever since he was a child...

40:37.200 --> 40:40.400
Bob's collected whatsoever he could find
about the James brothers.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.700
Yeah, got himself a little museum
in his room.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.500
Next time you come snooping around,
you better strap on a shooting iron!

40:47.000 --> 40:49.500
Well, you can see how scared I am.

40:49.700 --> 40:53.600
You too, Wood Hite. Cross me again,
I'll put a bullet through your head!

40:54.600 --> 40:55.800
Boy, you...

40:56.500 --> 40:59.100
Son, you better recollect
who my cousin is...

40:59.300 --> 41:03.400
because you've seemed to misremembered
that Jesse loves me like the Good Book.

41:03.500 --> 41:07.200
Now, you may play it like you're
a dangerous person in the grocery store...

41:07.300 --> 41:09.700
but don't misremember who you be accounting to...

41:09.900 --> 41:12.300
- if I so much get my feelings hurt.
- I don't care!

41:12.500 --> 41:14.100
Do I have to yell "suwee"?

41:14.200 --> 41:16.200
Why don't we make up,
be pleasant for once?

41:16.400 --> 41:19.200
Why don't we pass the evening
like pleasant human beings?

41:19.400 --> 41:21.600
I like your nickel suit, cowboy.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.200
You see something?

41:50.500 --> 41:52.300
Just a bird.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.900
<i>The month of October came...</i>

41:58.100 --> 42:01.600
<i>and Jesse began seeing Pinkerton operatives 
in every floor walker...</i>

42:01.700 --> 42:06.100
<i>street sweeper, and common man
poking about in a store.</i>

42:08.400 --> 42:10.900
<i>On the morning of the 11th,
he would wake his wife...</i>

42:11.100 --> 42:15.300
<i>with the Scripture pertaining 
to the Holy Family's flight into Egypt.</i>

42:19.000 --> 42:23.900
<i>Overnight, the Thomas Howard clan
vanished from Kansas City.</i>

42:34.400 --> 42:37.100
<i>Shortly thereafter,
four of the Blue Cut train robbers...</i>

42:37.300 --> 42:40.100
<i>were arrested in shacks near Glendale.</i>

42:45.100 --> 42:48.800
<i>How Jesse could have known remains a mystery.</i>

43:00.900 --> 43:03.900
<i>Theirs was a wandering existence.</i>

43:04.000 --> 43:05.700
<i>Men who choose to be outlaws...</i>

43:05.900 --> 43:09.900
<i>cannot afford to remain in one place
for very long.</i>

43:18.900 --> 43:23.200
- Well, goodness. Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

43:23.300 --> 43:25.600
- Martha.
- Buck up, man.

43:25.700 --> 43:29.300
<i>Wood and Dick would bicker
across the entire state of Kentucky...</i>

43:29.500 --> 43:34.400
<i>until they made Russellville, 
home of Major George Hite, Wood's father...</i>

43:34.600 --> 43:37.700
<i>and uncle to Frank and Jesse James.</i>

43:45.800 --> 43:48.000
You stay away from this one.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
She's my daddy's wife.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.100
You got it?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.600
Did you cook this, ma'am?

44:21.900 --> 44:24.200
I've got a nigger woman.

44:26.300 --> 44:27.300
How's that?

44:31.800 --> 44:35.100
Dick asked if I cooked this.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.900
Did you?

44:39.400 --> 44:40.500
No.

44:49.700 --> 44:52.100
She knew what he was like
when she married him.

45:18.600 --> 45:22.900
I guess we're the night owls, you and I.

45:24.300 --> 45:26.100
I'm glad.

45:28.400 --> 45:29.900
How come?

45:30.900 --> 45:33.500
You're interesting to look at.

45:34.400 --> 45:37.900
You have a real pleasant disposition.

45:39.500 --> 45:43.400
And I don't know, you sort of
make me feel warm all over.

45:45.400 --> 45:50.100
You know, I'm what they call a...
An inamorato.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.700
Well, I knew there had to be a name for it.

46:02.500 --> 46:04.700
You and the Hites
don't get along too well...

46:04.900 --> 46:08.100
if I'm to trust Wood 
and his version of the situation.

46:09.300 --> 46:12.800
We hate each other like poison,
if you wanna know the truth.

46:13.500 --> 46:17.200
Most of the Hites wouldn't spit on me
if I was on fire.

46:19.400 --> 46:22.200
They say that when a woman's on fire...

46:22.400 --> 46:26.800
you're supposed to roll her around on the ground 
and cover her with your body.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.900
Well, you are a naughty tease.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.800
Isn't it about bedtime?

46:41.100 --> 46:44.000
Well, I'll just kiss those dainty nubbins.

46:57.900 --> 46:59.300
Good night.

47:13.800 --> 47:14.900
Would you stop?

47:20.200 --> 47:24.200
Boy, I believe I drank too much coffee.

47:27.900 --> 47:31.200
I gotta go visit the privy,
something terrible. 

48:00.500 --> 48:02.800
This is embarrassing.

48:03.500 --> 48:07.600
Now, you go ahead and do your duty.
I don't mind.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.800
I've sort of got stage fright 
with a strange man in the commode with me.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.500
I ain't strange.

48:14.800 --> 48:17.700
I'm built just like the rest of them.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.600
You look awful pretty.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.700
Do I?

48:27.100 --> 48:31.800
I haven't never in my life seen
such well-shaped limbs.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.500
Is Wood awake?

48:43.700 --> 48:45.000
It's just me.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.800
And I bet you thought I was a lady.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.900
Well, you ain't much of a housekeeper,
are you?

49:49.300 --> 49:50.900
You didn't just happen by.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.100
Why not?

50:22.300 --> 50:25.200
Go on and take a load off your feet.

50:50.200 --> 50:52.300
You ought to get yourself a wife.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.000
Yeah.

50:54.300 --> 50:56.100
I suppose.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.700
I was gonna ask Martha. Charley's sister.

51:02.900 --> 51:06.300
I was gonna ask her
if she could imagine it.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.400
But I guess Wood has plans of his own.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.600
And there's always Dick Liddil
getting in the way.

51:14.700 --> 51:16.700
I'll give it some thought, though.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.400
Your crops come in?

51:20.600 --> 51:25.700
No, I don't got much.
Just a garden patch and a pasture.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.300
I was sick at planting time.

51:31.400 --> 51:32.800
So...

51:35.000 --> 51:37.300
Ed, how you feeling now?

51:40.100 --> 51:41.200
Why?

51:43.100 --> 51:45.300
You're acting queer.

51:53.800 --> 51:57.500
Well, you and me ain't been
just real good friends lately.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.500
That's not your fault,
you understand that.

52:03.900 --> 52:05.500
You hear talk, though.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.000
Talk?

52:12.900 --> 52:15.100
People tell you things.

52:22.600 --> 52:24.700
Why don't you give me an example?

52:29.000 --> 52:31.200
Jim Cummins come by here.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.100
Jim Cummins.

52:35.400 --> 52:37.600
Oh, and Jim says:

52:40.200 --> 52:43.900
"You know them boys
that got caught in the Blue Cut deal?"

52:47.000 --> 52:50.600
Well, Jim says he got word...

52:53.300 --> 52:57.300
that you're planning to kill them.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.400
Why would I do that?

53:03.400 --> 53:05.500
That's just talk probably.

53:09.500 --> 53:13.400
Jim Cummins. He say anything else?

53:13.700 --> 53:17.600
Nope. No, that was it, basically.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.400
That still don't explain why you're scared.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.900
Well, I'm in the same situation, you see.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.700
I was terrified I saw you ride up.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.300
- I just happened by, Ed.
- Suppose you heard gossip, though.

53:43.500 --> 53:46.400
Suppose you heard Jim Cummins come by, 
you might have thought...

53:46.600 --> 53:51.500
that we were planning to capture you
or get that reward, and that ain't true.

53:51.700 --> 53:54.000
But you might have suspected it.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.000
Haven't heard a lick of gossip lately.

54:15.200 --> 54:19.600
I got 600 dollars stashed away.
I don't need no governor's reward.

54:22.500 --> 54:24.400
Well, it's the principle too.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.900
Well...

54:31.200 --> 54:34.700
- I'm glad I stopped by.
- Oh, me too.

54:59.500 --> 55:02.600
What do you say
if we were to go for a ride?

55:07.500 --> 55:10.400
We can go into town. I'll buy you dinner.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.300
Then I'll be on my way.

55:23.300 --> 55:25.000
Okay.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.200
You ready to go for a ride?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.300
We going to your place?

56:50.200 --> 56:52.300
You seen Ed Miller lately?

56:53.700 --> 56:55.800
Nobody has.

56:59.600 --> 57:02.200
Must have gone off to California.

57:06.300 --> 57:08.600
I'd still like to know where we're going.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.700
If you were going to see Jim Cummins,
wouldn't you follow this road?

57:23.100 --> 57:24.900
I guess so.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.400
Howdy.

58:20.200 --> 58:22.400
Oh, are you friends of my pa's?

58:27.400 --> 58:29.300
We're friends of Jim Cummins.

58:33.400 --> 58:36.300
Well, it so happens he's been gone since August.

58:36.500 --> 58:38.500
And never said where he gone to.

58:43.500 --> 58:46.700
- I'm Matt Collins.
- Albert Ford.

58:46.900 --> 58:48.800
Very happy to meet you.

58:54.500 --> 58:58.000
- Dick Turpin.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

59:10.700 --> 59:12.700
I don't know where he is!
Leave me alone!

59:12.900 --> 59:14.700
Shut your mouth!
You shut your mouth!

59:16.700 --> 59:19.500
- You shut your mouth.
- I don't know where he is!

59:20.200 --> 59:22.200
- I don't know!
- Get in there.

59:23.100 --> 59:24.100
Shut up.

59:24.300 --> 59:26.800
- I don't know where he is!
- Shut up.

59:27.900 --> 59:29.400
- I don't know!
- Shut up.

59:29.500 --> 59:30.600
- Jesus.
- Shut up.

59:30.800 --> 59:32.900
Jesse, he's just a kid.

59:33.300 --> 59:36.900
He knows where his uncle Jim is 
and that's gonna make him old soon enough.

59:37.100 --> 59:39.400
- Maybe he doesn't know.
- He knows!

59:39.600 --> 59:41.200
You need to ask and ask sometimes.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.000
Sometimes a child don't remember so much at first. 
But it'll come back to him.

59:47.100 --> 59:49.600
My goodness, she's about to rip off,
sweetie.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.800
Just a little more here to get her started.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.700
Then I think I can rip her off
like a page from a book.

59:54.900 --> 59:57.000
Jesus, he can't even talk.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.400
Where's Jim?

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.000
Where's Jim?

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.700
Where's Jim? Where's Jim? Where's Jim?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.300
- Where's Jim?
- Quit it!

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.200
You bastard! I don't know where he is!

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.200
You won't believe me!
You never even gave me a chance!

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.400
You kept my... 
You kept my mouth shut!

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.200
I never know where Jim is or when he comes! 
So leave me alone.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.800
Get off me, you son of a bitch!

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.800
I'm worn out.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.900
I can't. No, see...

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.500
My mind's all tangled anyway.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.500
Little deals like this
just make me feel dirty.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.600
Are you all right, Jesse?

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.000
<i>Jesse was sick...</i>

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.600
<i>with rheums, and aches
and lung congestions.</i>

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.800
<i>Insomnia stained his eye sockets like soot.</i>

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.600
<i>He read auguries 
in the snarled intestines of chickens...</i>

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.400
<i>or the blow of cat hair
released to the wind.</i>

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.200
<i>And the omens promised bad luck,
which moated and dungeoned him.</i>

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:35.400
How come it's you
that's gotta do all the chores?

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.800
Charley and Bob pay extry to Martha
so that they don't have to.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.200
It still don't seem fair.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.500
Martha.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.900
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:01.900
You come from Kentucky?

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.200
Why do you have your head in a hole, Martha?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.900
Wood and Dick had a shooting scrape
a few months ago.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.800
Cover the kettle, Ida.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.400
And what did you and Dick
get in a scrape about?

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.200
Well, he tampered with my daddy's wife...

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.800
while a pork chop burned on the skillet...

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.500
so I shot at him.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.900
Ida! Do not stick your thumb
in the cream when you skim it.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:55.300
His chicanery and his philandering ways...

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
has instigated such malice.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.600
He's a yellow snake in the grass
and he can't be trusted, Martha.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.800
Dick told me a complete other version
of that affray.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:12.000
Wood Hite's downstairs.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:14.400
You mean he's here?

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.800
Yeah, he come in late last night.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600
Hey, simmer down!

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:29.300
Don't get into a fracas up there, you boys!
I've got breakfast almost ready.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.400
He's still sucking air.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.800
But I think he's a goner.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.200
Maybe y'all better come wish him well
on his journey.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.500
Wood?

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.200
You were a good fellow, Wood.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.899
Oh, I sure hope you're not
in frightful pain, Wood.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.200
I'd get you something to drink,
but I'm afraid you'd just choke on it.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.800
Little Ida's gonna miss you.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.100
So is the rest of the family.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.899
Well, one thing's settled.
Can't take him into Richmond.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.100
Why not?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.100
Well, one, sheriff'll put Bob in jail.

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:03.100
And two, Jesse'll find out 
his cousin Wood's been shot in our house...

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.700
and then that'll be the end
of each and every one of us.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.300
"And in one merciless, violent thrust,
broke in...

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.600
and carried all before him,
and scented and brewed...

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.300
reeking with blood of my virginity...

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:31.000
up to its utmost length in my body."

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.399
He ain't disappeared,
if that's what you were hoping.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:41.899
What chapter you on?

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:47.399
She's met some Algerian corsair
down at Gibraltar.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.899
Got herself all agitated.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.700
How's that leg?

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.600
Full of torment, Bob. Thanks for asking.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.200
<i>Blessed are the poor in spirit...</i>

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.600
<i>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.600
Blessed are them that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.700
Blessed are the...

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.700
Meek.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.900
Blessed are the meek.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.900
- Is it him?
- Yeah.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.100
Why is he here? 
Does he know about Wood, do you think?

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.700
I don't know. 
All I know is he don't miss very much.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.800
- What should I say about you if he asks?
- Tell him I'm in K.C. with Mattie.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:04.300
He was buffalo hunting.
He was thrilled to meet yours truly.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:08.400
Yeah, over there in Europe there's only two Americans 
they know for certain...

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.500
Mark Twain and Jesse James.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:16.100
- Why, it's the kid.
- How's everything?

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.200
- I never take off my gun belts.
- Yeah?

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.900
Good thinking.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.300
Well, Charley, did you hurt your leg?

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800
Yeah, I slipped...
I slipped off the roof...

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.600
and I smacked down into a snow bank
like a ton of stupidness.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.400
One second I'm screaming,
"Whoa, Nelly!"

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.300
Next second, poof,
I'm neck-deep in snow.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.000
Well, whatever possessed you
to climb a roof in December?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.500
There was a k... A kite. What am I saying?
There was a cat.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.100
A cat. It was on the roof
and I went after him.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.900
It was a tomcat yowling and what all, 
and I slipped.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.000
I thought maybe your club foot
was gaining on you.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.700
Oh, yeah.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.700
Dick went to Kansas City to be with his wife. 
He was here for a bit.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:02.200
Hey, here's a cute story, Jess.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.700
Bobby was what, 11 or 12...

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.100
and you were by far
his most admired personage.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.700
He couldn't get enough.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.100
It was "Jesse this" and "Jesse that" and "Jesse this" 
from sunrise to sunset.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.400
Fascinating.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.300
No, there's more. This is cute.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:23.200
We're at supper and Bob asks,
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.100
- Charley, Jesse doesn't wanna hear this.
- Shush, now, Bob, let me tell it.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.300
Bob says... He says, 
"You know what size boot Jesse wears?"

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:33.700
He says, "Six and a half." He says,
"Ain't that a big enough boot...

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.700
for a man 5'8" tall?"

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.700
I decided to josh him a little, you know,
he being my kid brother and everything.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.900
So I said, "He doesn't have toes is why."

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.600
That's a really stupid story.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.400
"He was dangling his feet off a culvert
and a catfish nibbled his toes off."

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.300
Bob taxed himself trying to picture it.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.800
That'd be a good joke if it was funny.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.200
Isn't that a cute story, Jess?

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.000
Give me some more conversations, Bob.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.200
I got one. This one's about as crackerjack...
It's the one about your...

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.300
Let Bob tell it.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.400
All right.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I don't even know what you're talking about.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:46.200
About how you and Jesse
have so much in common.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.900
Go on, Bob.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Yeah, come on, Bob.

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:56.000
Tell us a story.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:02.500
- Nope. No.
- Come on, entertain Jesse. He's here.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.000
Come on.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:21.800
Well, if you'll pardon my saying so,
I guess...

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
it is interesting the many ways 
you and I overlap and whatnot.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.100
I mean, you begin with our daddies.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.200
Your daddy was a pastor
at the New Hope Baptist Church...

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.100
and my daddy was a pastor
at the church in Excelsior Springs.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.900
You're the youngest of three James boys,
and I'm the youngest of five Ford boys.

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.400
Between Charley and me,
there's another brother, Wilbur...

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.600
with six letters in his name.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:56.500
And between Frank and you, 
is another brother Robert, also with six letters.

01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:00.500
And my Christian name is Robert, of course.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.000
You have blue eyes, I have blue eyes.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.100
You're 5'8" tall, I'm 5'8" tall.

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:18.300
Me, I must have had a list as long 
as your nightshirt when I was 12, but...

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.900
I seem to have lost some curiosities
over the years.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.300
Ain't he something?

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:59.100
Did I ever tell you the story about
that scalawag, George Shepherd?

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.300
Shepherd's one of Quantrill's lieutenants.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.200
He give me a story much like Bob's 
what bring him to mind.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.200
Going on about how much we had in common, 
and so on...

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.900
so he could get in the gang.

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.200
How could I have known
he had a grudge against me?

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.900
How could I have known
he was lying to get on my good side?

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:23.000
I said, "George, come on aboard.
Glad to have you."

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.000
George thought he was smart,
except he wasn't.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.100
One morning, George rides into camp...

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.500
and about 20 guns open up on him.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:42.700
See, old George, he only had one eye. 
You gotta have two eyes, you wanna get Jesse.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.700
You ought not think of me
like you do George Shepherd.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.300
You brought him to mind.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:57.500
Well, it's not very flattering.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.300
Sure is good eating, Martha.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.400
Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.700
How come George
had a grudge against you?

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.700
I said, how come George
had a grudge against you?

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:31.200
Well, you see, George had a nephew
he wanted me to protect during the war.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.600
This nephew had 5,000 dollars on him.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.400
It just so happens he winds up killed
and someone swipes that money.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.400
And when George is in prison,
someone whispers to him:

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:46.300
"It was Jesse James slit the boy's throat." 

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.500
It was just mean gossip, was it?

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.600
Bob's the expert. Let's put it to him.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.100
Oh, dear, I made him cranky.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:10.100
I'm not cranky. 
I just been through this before is all.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.400
Most people get around on making fun of me. 
They don't ever let up.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.600
Someone's getting awful fresh over there.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.500
Woman, shut your face for once.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.800
Don't want you to skip off
to your room and pout...

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.500
without knowing why I come by
for this visit.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.600
Why? So you could tell us 
how sorry you are...

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.300
you had to slap our cousin Albert around?

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.800
I come by...

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.300
to ask if one of you two Fords...

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:58.900
would care to ride with me
in a journey or two.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:02.700
I guess we both agree it ought to be Charley.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.600
You've been acting sort of testy.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.800
Have you seen Wood Hite lately?

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.900
No. Not at all.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.500
I swear that stew
had some squirrel meat in it.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.400
- Still arguing with you, is it?
- Yeah.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.100
- You're Charles Ford?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.300
You've seen me once or twice before.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.600
I got a letter from George Hite.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.100
He hasn't seen hide nor hair of him.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:11.800
And you say you haven't seen Wood?

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:15.700
No, I... 
I can't imagine where he could be.

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:44.200
Yeah?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.500
You finished with your sleeping?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.500
I could use a couple more hours
if it's no trouble.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.800
Yeah.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.800
I been holding a discussion with myself over 
if I ought to tell you this or no.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.700
My good side won out and...

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.800
Well, I wanna make a clean breast of things.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:25.100
Yeah, my mind's a little cobwebby
is the only drawback.

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.000
I could use a little...
a little more sleep.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.600
You know I went to Kentucky?

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.000
Yeah.

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.100
I come back through Saline County and...

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.400
I think to myself:

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.700
"Why not stop by and see Ed Miller?"

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:52.600
So I do.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.800
Well, things are not to my satisfaction.

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.700
Ed's got himself all worked up
over something.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.500
I can see that he's lying like a rug.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:15.900
So I say to myself, "Enough's enough."

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.200
And I say to Ed, "Come on, Ed.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.500
Let's go for a ride."

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.200
You understand what I'm saying?

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.400
Going for a ride is like...

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.600
Going for a ride
is like giving him what-for?

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.300
Exactly.

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:45.300
So...

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.800
Ed and Jesse...

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.500
they argue on the road.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.300
Did you ever count the stars?

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.700
I can't ever get the same number.
They keep changing on me.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.600
I don't even know what a star is exactly.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.500
Well, your body knows.

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.900
It's your mind that forgot.

01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:34.700
You go on ahead, partner.
I'll catch up with you.

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.800
It's okay.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.000
It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.500
And when push came to shove...

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:57.800
Jesse shot and killed him.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.000
Jesse did.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.200
You got it.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.600
You...

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:29.200
So, you see, your...

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.800
Your cousin, he got off easy.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.600
I was just playing with Albert.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:38.800
Yeah, I made him squeal once or twice myself.

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:42.100
I'm just not as thorough as you are.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.500
You got a tale to swap with me now?

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.600
I don't get your meaning.

01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:15.000
Seems to me, 
if you have something to confess in exchange...

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.300
it'd only be right...

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.600
that you'd spit it out now.

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.500
I can't think of a single thing.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.200
About Wood Hite, for example.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:46.200
I'm not gonna... I been saying over and over 
I can't figure out where he's gone.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.400
Now, I'm not gonna change my story
just to have something to spit.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.300
- Why was your brother so agitated?
- Which?

01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:54.400
Bob.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.700
That's just his way. He's antsy.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.000
You know?

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.700
You go on back to sleep now.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.500
You got me agitated now, you see?

01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:35.100
Yeah, just ain't no peace
when old Jesse's around.

01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.700
You ought to pity my poor wife.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.500
Ed Miller was a good friend of mine.

01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:47.100
He introduced me to you
at that one poker game.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.900
I'm a little angry with you, 
if you wanna know the God's honest truth.

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:56.800
You ought to pity me too.

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.300
<i>As proof of his confederacy with the James Gang, 
Bob told the authorities...</i>

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:50.000
<i>that Dick Liddil was sleeping over
at the rented farmhouse...</i>

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.000
<i>while his ruined leg mended.</i>

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.800
<i>And then, created a map
of the Harbison property...</i>

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.200
<i>leaving out the creek 
where Wood Hite's remains now moldered.</i>

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.200
Right, you boys are cornered!

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.900
Come on out peaceably 
and nobody'll get shot up!

01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:22.100
Don't shoot!

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.700
Come on out and show yourself!

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.300
Hello.

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.300
We got him.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.700
Give me that Colt, son.

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:57.200
- All right.
- Andrew James Liddil...

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.400
I have a warrant here for your arrest...

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:04.900
<i>Snowstorms would move over Missouri
that Sunday, February 19th...</i>

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.100
<i>shutting down commerce
for more than two days.</i>

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.400
- Go, go, go.
- Are the papers here?

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:16.200
- He wanted to know if the papers are here.
- I don't care what he wants.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.300
<i>Yet this wouldn't prevent Robert Ford...</i>

01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:20.900
<i>from presenting himself
to Governor Crittenden...</i>

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.100
<i>at the Craig Rifles Ball on Wednesday.</i>

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:27.900
I deem it a great privilege
on this glorious occasion...

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
to recognize publicly...

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.900
the intelligent and effective assistance...

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.800
that Captain Henry Craig has rendered
the state of Missouri and myself...

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.500
in our joint quest to rid Jackson County...

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:43.800
of the James band.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.600
The task that Captain Craig has assumed...

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:51.000
will require fearless courage,
extraordinary vigilance...

01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.100
and an unerring selection of instrumentalities.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.900
Well, I've gotten the signal from my wife
that enough is enough.

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:02.400
However, before I sit...

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.700
I would like to ask you
to join me in a toast...

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:09.900
to a great son of the state of Missouri...

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.900
- my friend, Henry Craig.
- Here, here.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:28.200
Yes.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.000
Just let my attorney know.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.900
Who is that? Who is it?

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.800
Get out of the way now.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.900
You know, you're more goddamn trouble
than you're worth, Bob.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.800
I was just gonna say hello.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:03.200
No, you weren't gonna do that, Bob.
That's not why you're down here.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:08.600
You think it's your goddamn coming-out.
You think you're the belle of the ball.

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.000
Now you get upstairs and try to keep your identity secret, 
you silly little bastard.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:16.000
The governor'll see you in good time.
Take him up, boys.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.700
<i>Bob would later be cross-examined repeatedly...</i>

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.000
<i>about the exact nature of the deal
he had made with the authorities.</i>

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.200
<i>And he was never consistent
in his recollections.</i>

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:39.600
My wife's asleep in the other room,
so let's speak as quietly as we can.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.500
So you're Dick Little.

01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:45.900
Liddil.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.500
I beg your pardon?

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.400
I spell it with two D's.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.000
He's given us a full confession, governor.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.200
Newspapers haven't caught onto it yet.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:58.900
And you've guaranteed him
a conditional pardon...

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.000
and amnesty for all the robberies
he's committed.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:05.900
You Robert Ford?

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.700
How old are you?

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:14.200
Twenty.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.000
You surrender to Sheriff Timberlake
as well?

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.100
No, no, governor. That's his brother,
Charley Ford, he's in the James Gang.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.000
But little Bob here,
we got nothing on Bob.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:26.700
He's just acting in capacity as a...

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:31.100
private detective.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.300
Jesse James sent me a telegram last month...

01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.600
saying he'd kill me
if he had to wreck a train to do it. 

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:40.400
He said once I got in his hands,
he'd cut my heart out...

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:43.100
and eat it in strips like it was bacon.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:45.200
I'll wreck his train first.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:56.900
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.
I was thinking about something else.

01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.400
Jesse James is nothing more
than a public outlaw...

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.400
who made his reputation
by stealing whatever he wanted...

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.800
killing whoever got in his way.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.600
You'll hear some fools say he's getting back
at Republicans and Union men...

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.500
for the wrongs his family suffered
during the war.

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.400
But his victims have scarcely been selected
with reference to their political views.

01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.600
I'm saying his sins will soon find him out.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.500
I'm saying his cup of iniquity is full.

01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.300
I'm saying Jesse James is a desperate case...

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.500
and may require a desperate remedy.

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:35.000
Y'all got the right man for the job.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:53.600
Come on. Come on, now.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:55.800
Come on, now.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.700
Have you ever considered suicide?

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.100
I can't say that I have. 
There's always something else I wanted to do.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.100
Or my predicaments changed,
or I saw my hardships from a different slant.

01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.600
You know all what can happen.
It never seemed respectable.

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.200
I'll tell you one thing that's for certain.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.400
You won't mind dying
once you've peeked over the other side.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.200
You'll no more wanna go back
to your body than...

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.800
you'd wanna spoon up your own puke.

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:34.100
Hey, since we're looking to rob banks...

01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:38.900
I was wondering if we could
add another fella to the gang...

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:42.700
and sort of see if we couldn't come out 
of our next job alive.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:50.200
Bob wanted to know could he ride with us
next time we took on a savings bank or...

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:59.000
A savings bank or a...

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.400
A railroad.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.100
Bob isn't much more than a boy
to most appearances.

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:16.000
But there's about two tons of sand in him.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.400
And he'll stand with a shooter
when that's what's called for.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.900
And he's smart too.
He's about as intricate as they come.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.700
You forget I already met the kid.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.800
Hell, he surely thinks highly of you.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:36.100
All of America thinks highly of me.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:40.000
Still, not like you got two million names
to snatch out of a sock...

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.300
whenever you need a third man.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.900
I can see you trying to wear me down on this.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.200
That's my main intention.

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:03.000
<i>Robberies would be conceived
but never carried out...</i>

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:06.700
<i>in Nebraska, Colorado and Missouri.</i>

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.500
<i>During this time...</i>

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.700
<i>Henry Craig enjoined Robert Ford 
to return to Elias' Grocery Store in Richmond...</i>

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.900
<i>and await instructions
from Sheriff James Timberlake.</i>

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:18.600
All right, three cans...

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:22.500
peaches. Two cans...

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.300
Two cans sifted peas.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.200
One bottle...

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.200
Mary's Morning Tonic, and a half...

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.900
Half a sack of flour.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.100
I'll be right with you.

01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.400
I haven't seen any sign of him.

01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:05.300
Well, do you know where he's living?

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:07.800
No.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:10.400
No?

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.900
Well, I can't guess how he does it...

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.300
but he is always knowledgeable
about what's going on.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.800
He's gonna know I've been here with you.
You ought to take that for granted.

01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.300
And he will kill you if he gets the chance.

01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.100
Are you willing to risk that?

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:43.400
Yes, I am.

01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:48.200
I've been a nobody all my life.

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.000
I was the baby.

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.700
I was the one they made promises to
that they never kept.

01:41:55.900 --> 01:42:00.600
And ever since I can remember it,
Jesse James has been as big as a tree.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.300
I'm prepared for this, Jim...

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.400
and I'm gonna accomplish it.

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:11.700
I know I won't get
but this one opportunity...

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.800
and you can bet your life
I'm not gonna spoil it.

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:27.900
Well...

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:31.100
wait for your chance.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:35.000
Don't let yourself be found alone with him,
and do not...

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.200
let him get behind you.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:07.600
You been chosen.

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:14.100
Well, what do you mean?

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.900
Well, your brother said 
that you might wanna join us.

01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.400
But maybe you like this grocery store
more than you said you did.

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.800
- So you missed me?
- Oh, yeah.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:30.100
I been crying myself to sleep every night.

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.700
Don't let him see us so much as wink.

01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.700
He's suspicious as a damn coyote,
and he don't trust you one iota.

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.200
- Well, I guess that makes...
- Hey.

01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:52.800
He already put away Ed Miller. 
He said so like it was something piddly he'd done.

01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:38.000
If we're ever alone for more than a minute,
I'd like a chance to talk to you further.

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:20.000
They gave me ten days.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.400
For what?

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.200
For arresting him.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:37.000
You and me, huh?

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.900
It's gonna happen one way or another, Charley. 
It's gonna happen.

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.700
So it might as well be us
who get rich on it.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.100
- Bob, he's our friend.
- He murdered Ed Miller.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.900
And he's gonna murder Liddil and Cummins
if the chance ever comes.

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:59.900
It seems to me Jesse's riding from man to man, 
saying goodbye to the gang.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.800
So your friendship could put you
under the pansies.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:10.300
I'll grind it fine in my mind, Bob. 
I can't go any further than that right now.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.400
You'll come around.

01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:19.000
You think it's all made up, don't you?

01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.500
You think it's all yarns
and newspaper stories.

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.700
He's just a human being.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:44.000
From now on, you two
won't go anywhere without me.

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:49.400
From now on, you'll ask for my permission!
From now on, you'll ask to be excused!

01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:49.600
Charley, take them horses around the barn. 
Bob, you go on inside.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:51.800
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.100
Look at this rotten parsnip
I found in the compost heap.

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.200
You never mentioned Bob would be here.

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:14.500
Maybe he was saving it as a pleasant surprise.

01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:21.800
Got two cousins for company now.

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:33.800
How it's gonna be is...

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.400
we'll leave next Monday afternoon
and ride down to Platte City.

01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:43.200
How far is that from Kansas City?

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.700
Platte City's 30 miles south.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:53.900
You and me and Charley'll sleep 
in the woods overnight...

01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:58.900
and we'll strike the Wells Bank
sometime before the court recesses.

01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.600
What time will that be exactly?

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.800
Well, you don't need to know that.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.800
You know, I'm real comfortable
with your brother.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.500
Hell, he's ugly as sin,
he smells like a skunk...

01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:39.800
and he's so ignorant
he couldn't drive nails in the snow...

01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.400
but he's sort of easy to be around.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.700
I can't say the same for you, Bob.

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:51.500
Well, I'm sorry to hear you say that.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:57.400
You know how it is when you're with your girlfriend 
and the moon's out...

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:01.600
and you know she wants to be kissed,
even though she never said so?

01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:06.500
Yeah.

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.600
Well, you're giving me signs
that grieve my soul...

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.600
and make me wonder...

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.400
maybe your mind's been changed about me.

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.200
Well, what do you want me to do?
Swear my good faith on the Bible?

01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:41.600
You two having a spat?

01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.400
I was getting ready to be angry.

01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:57.200
Sit over here closer, kid.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:00.700
Come on.

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.200
Charley, you'll stay with the animals.

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:16.700
Me and the kid...

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:20.900
will walk into that bank just before noon.

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:25.400
Bob will move that cashier...

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.100
away from the shotgun
that's under the counter...

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.200
and I'll creep up behind that cashier...

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:34.700
and I'll cock his head back like so.

01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:36.000
And I'll say:

01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:38.900
"How come an off-scouring like you 
is still sucking air...

01:51:39.100 --> 01:51:41.300
when so many of mine are in coffins?" 
I'll say:

01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:44.800
"How did you get to reach 20
without leaking out all over your clothes?"

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:49.200
And if I don't like his attitude,
I will slit that phildoodle so deep...

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.500
he will flop on the floor like a fish.

01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:58.500
My God, what just happened?

01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.100
Boy, I could hear your gears grinding...

01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:14.800
hear your little motor wondering,
"My gosh, what's next?

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.400
What's happening to me?"

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.100
You were precious to behold, Bob.

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:22.900
You were white as spit in a cotton field.

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:25.900
You got him. You got him.

01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:31.600
You wanna know how that feels?
Unpleasant. I honestly can't recommend it.

01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:39.600
The old Charley looked stricken!

01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.100
I was. I was.

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:47.200
"This is plumb unexpected", old Charley was thinking.
"That done ruined my day."

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.500
Hell. Hell.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:31.300
<i>Jesse slept with Bob
in the children's room that night.</i>

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:35.200
<i>And Bob remained awake.</i>

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.400
<i>He could see that there was a gun
on the nightstand.</i>

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.300
<i>He could imagine its cold nickel
inside his grip...</i>

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:50.700
<i>its two-pound weight reached out 
and aimed.</i>

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.900
I need to go to the privy.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.500
You think you do, but you don't.

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:53.900
You wait for grace, now.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.200
- Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Zee. God, that looks good.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.000
- Thank you, Zee.
- You're welcome.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.200
Well, is this fit to eat or will it just do?

01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:08.300
Woman's cooking's always been a scandal.

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.800
Cut her meat and the whole table moves.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.800
You want a biscuit?
You gonna have a biscuit?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.800
Here's some butter.
Come on. Come on.

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.000
Oh, shoot.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.000
<i>And so it went,
Jesse was increasingly cavalier...</i>

01:55:25.100 --> 01:55:28.900
<i>merry, moody, fey...</i>

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.100
<i>unpredictable.</i>

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:35.800
<i>He camouflaged his depressions
and derangements...</i>

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
<i>with masquerades of extreme cordiality, 
courtesy...</i>

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:42.900
<i>and goodwill towards others.</i>

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:48.300
<i>But even as he jested,
or tickled his boy in the ribs...</i>

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:52.100
<i>Jesse would look over at Bob
with melancholy eyes...</i>

01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.200
<i>as if the two were meshed
in an intimate communication.</i>

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.600
<i>Bob was certain that the man
had unriddled him...</i>

01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:04.500
<i>had seen through his reasons
for coming along...</i>

01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.600
<i>that Jesse could forecast 
each of Bob's possible moves and inclinations...</i>

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.700
<i>and was only acting the innocent...</i>

01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:15.800
<i>in order to lull Bob
into stupid tranquility and miscalculation.</i>

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.600
How long you been studying me?

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:44.300
You're gonna break a lot of hearts.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.400
How do you mean?

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.400
It's a present.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.600
It's heavy.

01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.300
Well, you gonna look inside?

01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:16.700
It's April Fools' Day, you know.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.100
It ain't no joke.

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:28.200
Oh, such extravagance.

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.400
Don't that nickel just shine, though?

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:34.200
It's more than I could hope for.

01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.100
I figured that granddaddy Colt
may blow into fragments...

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:40.100
next time you try to squeeze the trigger.

01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.700
Well, you might have something there.

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:45.800
Tom, supper's ready.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I'll be right there, sweetheart.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.500
I might be too excited to eat.

01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:57.300
You know what John Newman Edwards
once wrote about me?

01:57:58.300 --> 01:58:01.200
He said I didn't trust two men in 10,000...

01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:04.000
and even them I was cautious around.

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.800
Government's sort of run me ragged.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:11.800
I'm going the long way around the barn
to say that...

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:15.600
I been feeling cornered
and just plain ornery as of late...

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:21.000
and I'd be pleased if you'd accept that gun 
as my way of apologizing.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:26.200
Heaven knows I'd be ornerier
if I were in your position.

01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:29.400
No. No, I haven't been acting correctly.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.800
Seems I hardly recognize myself
when I'm greased.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:40.300
I go on journeys out of my body...

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.600
and look at my red hands
and my mean face...

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:49.100
and I wonder about that man
that's gone so wrong.

01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:55.900
I've been becoming a problem to myself.

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:09.900
Well...

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:21.200
- I better wash my hands if supper's on.
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.500
<i>The day before he died was Palm Sunday.</i>

01:59:38.500 --> 01:59:41.800
<i>And Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Howard,
their two children...</i>

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.100
<i>and their cousin Charles Johnson...</i>

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:49.400
<i>strolled to the Second Presbyterian Church 
to attend the 10:00 service.</i>

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.100
<i>Bob remained at the cottage...</i>

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:57.700
<i>and slyly migrated from room to room.</i>

02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:02.100
<i>He walked into the master bedroom...</i>

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:06.100
<i>and inventoried the clothes
on the hangers and hooks.</i>

02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.700
<i>He sipped from the water glass
on the vanity.</i>

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.300
<i>He smelled the talcum and lilacs
on Jesse's pillowcase.</i>

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.400
<i>His fingers skittered over his ribs...</i>

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:36.500
<i>to construe the scars
where Jesse was twice shot.</i>

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.900
<i>He manufactured a middle finger
that was missing the top two knuckles.</i>

02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.200
<i>He imagined himself at 34.</i>

02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.200
<i>He imagined himself in a coffin.</i>

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:04.000
<i>He considered possibilities...</i>

02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:07.500
<i>and everything wonderful
that could come true.</i>

02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.200
He's not gonna kill us.

02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.600
Yeah, he is.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.400
Well, I'll stay awake so he can't.

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.200
You're imagining things.

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:19.500
Ain't gonna be no Platte City.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:23.800
That's Jesse fooling with us.

02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.500
Go to sleep, Charley.

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.700
Morning.

02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.000
Charley.

02:03:52.900 --> 02:03:55.300
Bob, how much did you want to eat?

02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.200
I'm feeling sort of peculiar.

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.900
Why is it you're looking so interested?

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.300
You think it's intelligent
to go out like that...

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.300
so all creation can see your guns?

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.500
Hi.

02:04:59.800 --> 02:05:02.700
Come on, let's go see
what your mama's doing.

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.900
Timmy, get that door, would you?

02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:13.300
- Well, you lost your shoe, sweetheart.
- Yeah, I did.

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:17.600
That's gonna be a problem.
They don't sell those one at a time.

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:21.100
We lost a shoe, Mama.

02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:25.300
Will you put that up for Daddy,
would you?

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:31.100
- What you doing, you lose a shoe?
- Yeah.

02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:51.300
It's only meant to go on top,
to complement.

02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:53.400
Yeah, I know. Sometimes, I...

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.900
Bob, everything's getting cold!

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:25.000
- Where's Mary?
- She's outside, darling.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.800
Mary?

02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:34.100
What do you think goes on
in that noggin of his?

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:38.800
Nothing.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:42.100
I was talking about his mind, not yours.

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:44.800
Oh, yeah.

02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:47.000
Oh, I get it.

02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:44.300
Well, hello now.

02:07:44.700 --> 02:07:47.800
"The arrest and confession of Dick Liddil."

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.200
You don't say so.

02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:11.600
That's very strange.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.900
Says here Dick surrendered three weeks ago.

02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.700
You must have been right in the neighborhood.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:21.000
Well, apparently, they kept it a secret.

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.300
If I get to Kansas City soon,
I'll ask somebody about it.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.700
You two ready?

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.000
I will be, by noon.

02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.600
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:02.500
<i>She's loaded deep
As deep can be</i>

02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:05.000
<i>But not as deep
As the love I'm in</i>

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:09.200
<i>I know not if I sink or swim</i>

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:11.900
<i>The water is wide</i>

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.600
<i>I can't cross o'er
And neither have I wings to fly</i>

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.800
<i>Give me a boat
That can carry two</i>

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.900
<i>Both shall row
My love and I</i>

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.500
<i>For love is gentle
And love is kind</i>

02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:33.700
<i>Sweetest flower
When first it's new</i>

02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:37.400
<i>But love grows old
And waxes cold</i>

02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:40.900
<i>And fades away
Like the morning dew</i>

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.100
<i>There is a ship
She sails the sea</i>

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.000
I guess I'll take my guns off...

02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:49.300
for fear the neighbors might spy them.

02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.100
Don't that picture look dusty?

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.200
What have...? 
What have you done?

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.200
Jesse.

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:20.800
Jesse?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.100
Jesse? Jesse?

02:13:24.800 --> 02:13:26.700
Jesse!

02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:29.800
No!

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.300
No. Jess...

02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:41.300
Come back. Oh, come back.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.600
Oh, Jesse! No!

02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:52.000
Oh, Bob. Have you done this?!

02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:54.600
I swear to God I didn't.

02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:57.000
It was an accident, Zee.

02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:02.600
Come on. 
Pistol went off accidentally.

02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.100
Put my name.

02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:51.800
Why, what'd you do? I shot him.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
You might wanna keep that.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Thank you all very much.

02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:51.700
<i>The resulting prints
sold for 2 dollars apiece...</i>

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:56.500
<i>and were the models for the lithographed covers 
on a number of magazines.</i>

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.200
<i>Soon a thousand strangers 
were making spellbound pilgrimages to the cottage...</i>

02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:12.100
<i>or were venerating the iced remains
in Seidenfaden's cooling room.</i>

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.500
<i>The man who offered 30,000 dollars 
for the body of President Garfield's assassin...</i>

02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:21.600
<i>sent a telegram to City Marshal Enos Craig 
offering 50,000...</i>

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:24.100
<i>for the body of Jesse Woodson James...</i>

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:27.000
<i>so that he could go around the country
with it...</i>

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:34.400
<i>or at least sell it to P.T. Barnum
for his Greatest Show on Earth.</i>

02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:41.500
<i>Another photograph was taken
of the renowned American bandit...</i>

02:16:41.700 --> 02:16:44.299
<i>nestled in his bed of ice.</i>

02:16:44.500 --> 02:16:48.799
<i>And it was this shot that was most available 
in sundries and apothecaries...</i>

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:52.600
<i>to be viewed in a stereoscope
alongside the sphinx...</i>

02:16:52.799 --> 02:16:56.799
<i>the Taj Mahal,
and the catacombs of Rome.</i>

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.900
Hello, here!

02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:26.700
"The arrest and confession of Dick Liddil."

02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:32.000
Young man, I thought you told me
you didn't know Dick had surrendered.

02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.100
You mean he did? I didn't know.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.900
But I knew I had not fooled him.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:42.900
And he knew, as well as I, in that moment 
that I intended to bring him to justice.

02:17:43.799 --> 02:17:47.400
But he would not kill me
in the presence of his wife and children.

02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:50.799
And so he was smiling to throw me off-guard.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.700
Well, it's all right, anyway, Bob.

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:01.500
<i>It was widely felt that Bob 
possessed some acting talent...</i>

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.900
<i>and Charley, not a jot.</i>

02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:07.000
That picture's awful dusty.

02:18:07.799 --> 02:18:10.900
<i>Charley was only expected
not to slouch or mutter...</i>

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:15.799
<i>and to transport his sicknesses
to the alley before letting them go.</i>

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.000
And that's...

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:50.299
how I killed Jesse James.

02:18:53.799 --> 02:18:57.299
<i>By October of 1883, 
Bob Ford could be identified correctly...</i>

02:18:57.500 --> 02:19:01.700
<i>by more citizens than could
the president of the United States.</i>

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:07.100
<i>He was as renowned at 20 as Jesse was
after 14 years of grand larceny.</i>

02:19:07.299 --> 02:19:09.500
You won't get your hooks into me.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.799
That's right. That's right.
Sit next to your boyfriend. Jezebel.

02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:17.000
<i>Charley was increasingly superstitious...</i>

02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:19.900
<i>increasingly subject
to the advice of soothsayers...</i>

02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:24.100
<i>who promised to cure his miseries
with pipe smoke and poultices.</i>

02:19:24.299 --> 02:19:27.500
You been spending too much time
with Gypsies, Charley.

02:19:33.299 --> 02:19:34.600
Shit.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.500
The picture's awful dusty.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.799
<i>Something began to change
in Charley's stage portrayal of Jesse.</i>

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.500
<i>His gait seemed more practiced.</i>

02:19:48.700 --> 02:19:52.000
<i>His voice was spookily similar to the man's.</i>

02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:54.500
<i>His newly suggested dialogue was analogous...</i>

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:57.700
<i>to a script Jesse might have originated.</i>

02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.000
<i>He began to look at his younger brother
with spite...</i>

02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:05.800
<i>as if he suspected 
that in some future performance...</i>

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:10.500
<i>he might present himself
to a live cartridge in Robert Ford's gun.</i>

02:20:11.800 --> 02:20:13.700
Murderer!

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.700
Cur!

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:18.100
Coward!

02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:26.200
You wanna investigate my courage?
Do you?

02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:30.400
Find out! Find out!

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.900
Nobody.

02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:53.300
Coward!

02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:24.000
<i>By his own approximation, 
Bob assassinated Jesse James over 800 times.</i>

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:28.000
<i>He suspected no one in history
had ever so often or so publicly...</i>

02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:31.300
<i>recapitulated an act of betrayal.</i>

02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.300
<i>Bob always challenged
the allegations of cowardice...</i>

02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:42.400
<i>but Charley seemed to agree with them.</i>

02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:46.500
<i>He spoke of Mrs. Zee James
as certain priests might the Madonna...</i>

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:49.700
<i>and composed long soul-describing letters
to her...</i>

02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:52.100
<i>begging her forgiveness...</i>

02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:56.000
<i>none of which he mailed.</i>

02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:29.500
<i>Charley Ford became all that his countrymen 
wanted an assassin of Jesse James to be.</i>

02:22:33.700 --> 02:22:39.600
<i>Jesse James was a man
Who killed many men</i>

02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:45.200
<i>He robbed the Glendale train</i>

02:22:45.500 --> 02:22:51.300
<i>And he stole from the rich
And he gave to the poor</i>

02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:56.500
<i>He had a hand
And a heart and a brain</i>

02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:02.800
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:08.100
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:13.800
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:19.100
<i>Has laid Jesse James in his grave</i>

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:25.200
<i>It was Robert Ford
That dirty little coward</i>

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.400
<i>I wonder how does he feel</i>

02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:36.300
<i>For he ate at Jesse's bread
And he slept in Jesse's bed</i>

02:23:36.400 --> 02:23:41.500
<i>And he laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

02:23:41.900 --> 02:23:47.500
<i>Well, Jesse had a wife
To mourn for his life</i>

02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:52.500
<i>Three children
They were brave</i>

02:23:52.700 --> 02:23:58.300
<i>But that dirty little coward
Who shot Mr. Howard</i>

02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:02.700
<i>Has laid poor Jesse in his grave</i>

02:24:14.200 --> 02:24:16.300
I'm Robert Ford.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:30.700
It was two children, not three.

02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:43.400
Hey.

02:24:44.300 --> 02:24:46.900
You get yourself home, son, okay?

02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:51.600
Come on. Get out of here.
Get out of my place.

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.600
<i>He thought, at his angriest...</i>

02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:29.500
<i>about visiting the kin
of Jesse's slaughtered victims:</i>

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:34.800
<i>Mrs. William Westfall in Plattsburg...</i>

02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:40.400
<i>the Wymore family in Clay County...</i>

02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:49.800
<i>perhaps even Mrs. Joseph Heywood
in Northfield, Minnesota.</i>

02:25:52.900 --> 02:25:55.900
<i>He would go to their homes
and give his name as Robert Ford...</i>

02:25:56.100 --> 02:25:59.000
<i>the man who killed Jesse James.</i>

02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:03.500
<i>He imagined they would be grateful to him.</i>

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:59.500
<i>It was only with Dorothy Evans
that Bob spoke revealingly or plainly...</i>

02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:04.100
<i>and it was with her that he spoke of things 
he didn't know he knew.</i>

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:29.800
<i>He told her that he had no real memory
of the shooting and its aftermath.</i>

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.900
<i>He could remember lifting the gun
that Jesse had given him...</i>

02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:38.600
<i>and then it was Good Friday 
and he was reading about the funeral proceedings...</i>

02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:41.300
<i>as if they'd happened a long time ago.</i>

02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:45.000
Why did you kill him?

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:51.400
Well, he was gonna kill me.

02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.800
So you were scared 
and that's the only reason?

02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:04.000
Yeah.

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:06.500
And the reward money.

02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:15.100
Do you want me to change the subject?

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:25.700
You know what I expected?

02:28:26.700 --> 02:28:28.700
Applause.

02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:35.400
I was only 20 years old then.
I couldn't see how it would look to people.

02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:42.200
I was surprised by what happened.

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:45.200
They didn't applaud.

02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:50.500
<i>He was ashamed of his boasting...</i>

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:53.600
<i>his pretensions of courage
and ruthlessness.</i>

02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:57.600
<i>He was sorry about his cold-bloodedness,
his dispassion...</i>

02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:03.700
<i>his inability to express
what he now believed was the case:</i>

02:29:06.300 --> 02:29:09.300
<i>That he truly regretted killing Jesse...</i>

02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.100
<i>that he missed the man
as much as anybody...</i>

02:29:13.600 --> 02:29:16.700
<i>and wished his murder
hadn't been necessary.</i>

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:38.300
<i>Even as he circulated his saloon...</i>

02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:42.200
<i>he knew that the smiles disappeared
when he passed by.</i>

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:45.200
<i>He received so many menacing letters...</i>

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:48.800
<i>that he could read them
without any reaction except curiosity.</i>

02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:57.400
<i>He kept to his apartment all day,
flipping over playing cards...</i>

02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:03.400
<i>looking at his destiny
in every king and jack.</i>

02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:11.900
<i>Edward O'Kelly came up from Bachelor
at 1 p.m. on the 8th.</i>

02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:17.300
<i>He had no grand scheme, no strategy...</i>

02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:19.900
<i>no agreement with higher authorities...</i>

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.800
<i>nothing beyond a vague longing for glory...</i>

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:28.100
<i>and a generalized wish
for revenge against Robert Ford.</i>

02:30:35.900 --> 02:30:39.200
- How'd it go last night?
- Not so bad.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:43.800
The other one.

02:30:46.300 --> 02:30:49.100
<i>Edward O'Kelly would be ordered
to serve a life sentence...</i>

02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:52.200
<i>in the Colorado Penitentiary
for second-degree murder.</i>

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:55.100
<i>Over 7000 signatures
would eventually be gathered...</i>

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.500
<i>on a petition asking for O'Kelly's release...</i>

02:30:57.700 --> 02:31:02.700
<i>and in 1902, Governor James B. Orman
would pardon the man.</i>

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:07.700
You shouldn't be wearing that stickpin
again there, Bob. Opals are unlucky.

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:13.400
My luck's not very good as it is. 
I don't think an opal's gonna change that much.

02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:15.700
I hear you.

02:31:29.300 --> 02:31:31.200
<i>There would be no eulogies for Bob...</i>

02:31:32.900 --> 02:31:37.000
<i>no photographs of his body
would be sold in sundries stores...</i>

02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:42.000
<i>no people would crowd the streets
in the rain to see his funeral cortege...</i>

02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:46.800
<i>no biographies would be written
about him...</i>

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:49.500
<i>no children named after him.</i>

02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:55.800
<i>No one would ever pay 25 cents
to stand in the rooms he grew up in.</i>

02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:02.100
Hello, Bob.

02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:07.700
<i>The shotgun would ignite,
and Ella Mae would scream...</i>

02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:12.200
<i>but Robert Ford would only lay on the floor 
and look at the ceiling...</i>

02:32:12.300 --> 02:32:14.800
<i>the light going out of his eyes...</i>

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.700
<i>before he could find the right words.</i>
