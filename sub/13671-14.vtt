WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
 'Previously...'
 I took this job to run
 my own department.

00:05.080 --> 00:08.160
 Love the people you meet
 in public service.

00:08.160 --> 00:12.080
 The bag lady...
 there's something
 else wrong with her.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.200
 Tourette's syndrome is
 a neurological disorder.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.840
 Drugs may help.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.640
 I was 7 when
 my parents died.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.320
 Congratulations,
 orphan of the year.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.520
 Victor, I don't know how
 to tell you this.

00:24.520 --> 00:28.520
 Victor,
 we're your parents.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.880
 This is where
 our son works...

01:55.880 --> 01:57.320
 a place of healing.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.760
 We're so proud.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.640
 What was the colour
 of my security blanket?

02:01.640 --> 02:03.080
 Blue...
 and white checks.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.200
 Damn.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.640
 Exact time
 of birth?

02:05.640 --> 02:08.440
 7.33am,

02:08.440 --> 02:09.800
 which makes you a Libra
 with Leo rising.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.240
 First French kiss?

02:11.240 --> 02:14.480
 Carolyn Stolper,
 front seat

02:14.480 --> 02:16.720
 of Charice's
 Oldsmobile
 Vista Cruiser.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.880
 With or without braces?

02:17.880 --> 02:19.360
 Her with,
 you without.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.920
 How can you possibly
 know about Carolyn?

02:20.920 --> 02:23.720
 Our intelligence
 is excellent.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.360
 OK, so you've
 done your research.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.960
 Probably tortured it
 out of Aunt Charice.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.160
 I tried calling her
 to confirm your story.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.200
 She give us the seal
 of approval?

02:34.200 --> 02:37.040
 Phone's disconnected.
 Ditto my brother and sister.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.960
 What have you
 done with them?
 Who sent you?

02:39.960 --> 02:43.560
 Don't get hysterical.
 Accept us as your parents.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.240
 Where have you been
 all these years?

02:45.240 --> 02:48.320
 We're not
 at liberty to say.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.200
 That's convenient.
 Not at liberty
 about the big things.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.160
 The little things...the braces,
 the Oldsmobile...you know.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.640
 I told you he
 wouldn't believe us.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.560
 He will.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.360
 Holga, Victor
 takes after you...

03:01.360 --> 03:03.280
 same eyes,
 blond hair.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.400
 Same suspicious
 nature.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.440
 She has red hair.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.640
 Henna. Used
 to be blonde.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.200
 Our son, the surgeon.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.160
 We're so lucky, Lech.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.080
 Yeah.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.920
 Lech, Holga.
 It sounds so foreign.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.720
 Do you have
 green cards?

03:15.720 --> 03:19.720
 I feel like I'm having
 brain dialysis.

03:20.680 --> 03:24.080
 How long will this
 feasibility study take?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.200
 I told the trustees
 a couple days.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.720
 Now that I'm here...

03:28.720 --> 03:30.360
 Fiscus,
 how you feeling?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.760
 Sore. Scar itches
 like crazy.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.480
 How's the class
 at U Mass?

03:34.480 --> 03:36.640
 Fine, except for
 non-majors math.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.240
 Look at
 this problem.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.160
 "If 152 businessmen
 are in line

03:42.160 --> 03:43.840
 "to be audited
 by the IRS,

03:43.840 --> 03:46.520
 "and twice as many of them
 are wearing blue suits as grey,

03:46.520 --> 03:49.800
 "but only 1/3 as many
 are wearing magenta as blue,

03:49.800 --> 03:52.080
 "how many
 are wearing magenta?"

03:52.080 --> 03:55.200
 The kind of businessman
 who wears a magenta suit

03:55.200 --> 03:56.800
 don't pay taxes.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.120
 We need more facts.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.400
 Two-piece or vests?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.400
 Polyester, wool,
 or blends?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.160
 How will
 solving this

04:03.160 --> 04:05.600
 help me become a better
 physician's assistant?

04:05.600 --> 04:09.000
 Teaches you the
 importance of accessories.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.800
 I'd look into some
 red and black Pentels.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.240
 Psst!

04:15.240 --> 04:16.560
 Luther.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.920
 They are,
 aren't they?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.040
 You're late.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.720
 I came straight
 from class.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.520
 Mr Ree's
 still not improving.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.120
 You can
 read a chart.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.280
 Good for you.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.200
 Checking his vitals
 every half hour?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.840
 Didn't your shift
 already start?

04:29.840 --> 04:30.880
 Yes.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.120
 Planning on scrubbing
 bedpans in school duds?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.680
 Got my clothes here.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.680
 Sharp. Hope that pocket
 holster comes back in style.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.960
 Salt on your
 cantaloupe,

04:43.960 --> 04:47.320
 or just
 glad to see me?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.040
 Out of season.
 Flabby cantaloupe. Perks them up.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.920
 Surprising, though. I mean,
 heart surgeon, sodium.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.520
 Oh, this coffee
 is so delicious.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.720
 Scrumptious.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.040
 I prefer mine
 with mocha mix.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.480
 You sound so sullen

05:01.480 --> 05:03.880
 with a mouthful
 of melon, dear.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.760
 That's what
 I missed most,

05:05.760 --> 05:07.760
 real coffee with
 half-and-half.

05:07.760 --> 05:08.840
 Missed most?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.280
 When we were away.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.720
 And cantaloupe,
 dream on.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.320
 Mangoes, mangoes,
 more mangoes.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.920
 An occasional
 papay...

05:14.920 --> 05:16.040
 Ahem.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.120
 Papaya.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.600
 You look tired, dear.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.440
 Don't mother me.
 You aren't my parents.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.320
 My real parents
 died in a car crash.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.760
 I've been an orphan,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.680
 then, ta-da!
 You show up last night.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.040
 What better time to find out
 you have parents

05:31.040 --> 05:33.920
 than after winning
 Orphan of the Year award?

05:33.920 --> 05:37.920
 I'm late for rounds.
 Meet me at the elevators.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.200
 Uh...

05:51.160 --> 05:55.160
 Duh-duh-duh.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.400
 Oh, excuse me.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.800
 In addition to
 lower quadrant tenderness,

06:07.800 --> 06:09.240
 the patient is febrile,

06:09.240 --> 06:10.680
 with an elevated
 white cell count.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.000
 Course of treatment?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.120
 History shows
 allergy to penicillin.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.120
 We'll begin gentamycin
 and continue to monitor CBC.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.720
 Stay here. I'll be back
 after rounds.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.320
 Congratulations
 on your sonhood.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.720
 Don't mean to be churlish,
 but cool the kudos.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.760
 It's wonderful
 you found your parents.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.600
 They found me.
 Maybe they're not mine.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.040
 Maybe they're impostors
 running some scam,

06:33.040 --> 06:34.800
 after my inheritance.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.720
 If they're not your parents,
 there is no inheritance.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.120
 Ehrlich, next case.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.560
 Yes, sir?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.000
 Next case.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.320
 Oh, right.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.160
 Renacia, Gerald, male,
 45, meatpacker,

06:45.160 --> 06:46.480
 intermittently   febrile,

06:46.480 --> 06:47.720
 probably   brucellosis.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.160
 Not probably.
 Definitely.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.320
 Good.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.200
 Not Renacia...
 Potter, you lunkhead.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.120
 Axelrod presented
 that case 20 minutes ago.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.000
 I'm not over
 the shock

06:57.000 --> 06:58.480
 of last night's
 revelations.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.360
 Leave the melodrama
 at home,

07:00.360 --> 07:02.320
 and get here
 on time.

07:02.320 --> 07:05.680
 Rounds are over.
 Grow up, Ehrlich.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.920
 Victor.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.320
 Looks like I'm
 the senior resident.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.760
 What's on the agenda?

07:10.760 --> 07:13.680
 We frosh scrubs anticipate
 some pithy insights.

07:13.680 --> 07:16.520
 It's tough being
 a first year resident,

07:16.520 --> 07:20.320
 everybody trying to show you
 how much you don't know.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.720
 I'm different.
 I want your input.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.120
 I'm easy,
 so chime right in.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.280
 Sounds great.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.360
 Let's roll.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.680
 Oh, wait.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.120
 Paulette, meet
 Larry Darnell.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.040
 He's making
 a financial assessment

07:32.040 --> 07:33.480
 of St Eligius.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.320
 Dr Kiem is director
 of medical education.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.760
 Nice to meet you.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.920
 My pleasure.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.320
 I'll see you shortly.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.240
 I'm speaking to all
 the department heads

07:43.240 --> 07:46.120
 about the hows and whys
 of cost efficiency.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.520
 Routine inspection?

07:47.520 --> 07:50.440
 No. Board is conducting
 a feasibility study

07:50.440 --> 07:52.320
 to determine
 if St Eligius

07:52.320 --> 07:53.720
 can continue
 operating efficiently.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.200
 What's the alternative?

07:55.200 --> 07:59.200
 Tighten the budget
 or close the doors.

07:59.320 --> 08:03.320
 I'm not brain-damaged,
 just brain-different.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.520
 OK.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.960
 Oh, no.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.880
 Kevin is coming
 to town this evening.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.200
 You're lucky
 he could get away.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.600
 His weekend is
 Thursday and Friday.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.920
 Once the Sunday 0p-ed
 goes to bed, he's free.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.800
 I've heard commuter marriages
 keep relationships fresh.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.080
 Too fresh.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.520
 Married 21 years.

08:26.520 --> 08:29.400
 Now I feel obligated
 to entertain Kevin

08:29.400 --> 08:30.840
 every time
 he visits.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.280
 Tonight,
 the symphony,

08:32.280 --> 08:34.200
 tomorrow,
 the Bruins.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.120
 A big time
 in Beantown.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.039
 Courtesy Kiem Travel.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.960
 Kevin's a hockey fan?

08:39.960 --> 08:43.480
 I am! Not a lot of ice skating
 in Vietnam.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.640
 Hockey, c'est
 tres exotique.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.240
 Until someone creases
 your skull with a puck.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.480
 This arrangement has been tough
 on both of us.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.120
 You get used to
 living alone.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.000
 Then this stranger
 shows up and says,

08:56.000 --> 08:57.400
 "Where's my striped
 sweater?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.280
 "Why did you rearrange
 the silverware drawer?"

09:00.280 --> 09:02.200
 By the time
 we're comfortable,

09:02.200 --> 09:05.240
 one of us
 is back on the shuttle.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.560
 Save energy
 for Kevin.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.040
 Leave as soon
 as possible today.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.920
 Work is easy, Donald.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
 Fun is hard.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.360
 Ahem.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.480
 What?

09:22.480 --> 09:25.080
 How did you...
 don't you knock?

09:25.080 --> 09:26.360
 Forgive us.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.440
 We're out of practice.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.880
 Haven't knocked
 for years.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.280
 No reason to.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.480
 Who are you?

09:31.480 --> 09:32.960
 Victor Ehrlich's
 parents.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.720
 Oh, so you do exist.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.600
 I thought maybe
 the whole business

09:38.600 --> 09:41.960
 was a figment of Ehrlich's
 febrile imagination.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.480
 Well, sit down.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.480
 Oh, thank you.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.160
 We need your help.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.600
 Talk to our son.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.000
 He looks up to you...
 figuratively.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.280
 You're his idol,
 his Allen Dulles.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.920
 Dulles? I don't
 follow you.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.280
 He doesn't believe
 we're his parents.

09:59.280 --> 10:00.680
 There's lots
 we can't reveal...

10:00.680 --> 10:02.600
 where we've been...

10:02.600 --> 10:04.440
 ..What we've been doing. Naturally,
 Bernie's sceptical.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.640
 Bernie?

10:05.640 --> 10:07.080
 Bernie is Victor's
 real name.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.480
 Changed when he was a baby
 for his protection.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.920
 I can see why.

10:11.920 --> 10:14.000
 Look, Mr And Mrs, Uh...

10:14.000 --> 10:15.200
 Oseransky.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.080
 I don't know your story,

10:17.080 --> 10:20.920
 but I suggest you spill
 the beans to your boy.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.840
 He's been more useless
 than usual today.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.680
 I'd like to squelch
 this soap opera

10:26.680 --> 10:28.160
 in the opening aria.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.640
 Maybe Dr Craig's
 right.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.080
 Bernie
 is very upset.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.320
 Trust me.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.240
 If Ehrlich hyperventilates
 about something,

10:35.240 --> 10:39.040
 he can suck the oxygen
 right out of a room.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.640
 We'll have to
 get clearance.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.800
 Mm-hmm.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.720
 Obviously you're
 ridden with guilt,

10:43.720 --> 10:45.160
 abandoning your kids

10:45.160 --> 10:48.000
 without so much
 as a Christmas card

10:48.000 --> 10:49.440
 for 20 years.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.800
 Take my suggestion.
 Make a clean breast of it.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.200
 If only life
 were that simple.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.080
 Could I see you alone
 for a minute?

10:58.080 --> 10:59.480
 Would you mind, dear?

10:59.480 --> 11:03.480
 Of course. A pleasure, Dr Craig.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.080
 Ah. Well...

11:10.080 --> 11:11.640
 you see, Doctor...

11:11.640 --> 11:15.640
 the thing is, um...

11:15.800 --> 11:19.160
 I have this   burning sensation   every
 time I urinate.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.160
 What do you think
 that could be?

11:26.880 --> 11:29.720
 "Scarlet was pretty,
 and she knew it.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.640
 "She would have Ashley
 for her own

11:32.640 --> 11:34.520
 "before the day
 was over."

11:34.520 --> 11:37.440
 Mr And Mrs Klein,
 I'm sorry to interrupt.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.320
 No, no problem.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.720
 Harry always
 reads to me.

11:41.720 --> 11:45.720
 In 52 years of marriage,
 we've read...

11:46.760 --> 11:48.320
 Over 1,000 books.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.240
 Gone With The Wind.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.200
 It's a wonderful novel,

11:52.200 --> 11:54.040
 but it's too long.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.760
 We'll never finish.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.720
 Oh, Anita, stop.
 We will so.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.560
 And War And   Peace, too.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.920
 We aced that
 on our honeymoon.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.760
 Now we're going to start
 Winds Of War...

12:05.760 --> 12:08.160
 in all three volumes.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.960
 Harry...he reads to me while
 I do the housework.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.960
 It's, uh, it's his way
 of ducking the chores,

12:16.360 --> 12:18.560
 but I don't mind.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.400
 Anita, I do the reading
 so that you don't strain

12:22.400 --> 12:24.280
 your beautiful
 hazel eyes.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.720
 When I'm gone,

12:25.720 --> 12:29.560
 I hope he finds another listener
 as good as me.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.480
 24 maybe,
 and, uh, blonde?

12:32.480 --> 12:33.920
 Anita, stop teasing.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.640
 Don't even think
 about leaving me.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.320
 Where you and I are attached,
 it's a vital organ.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.760
 Dr Kiem, uh...
 are you married?

12:43.760 --> 12:47.760
 Yes...every weekend.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.840
 So, you going
 to join us?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.280
 I don't think so.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.120
 I don't want have a meeting
 of the minds solo.

12:59.120 --> 13:03.000
 Parents and paella? No thanks.
 Too many shells to crack.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.920
 I don't blame you.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.360
 What are they like?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.760
 Strange, secretive,
 wandering around the hospital.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.680
 I found them
 taking pictures

13:10.680 --> 13:14.040
 of the magnetic   resonance scanner
 with their wrist watches.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.640
 They said they liked to relax
 with clandestine photography.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.840
 They're playing tourist.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.960
 They're not
 the real thing.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.520
 You're the real
 Inspector Hound?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.000
 Precisely, but I need
 more evidence.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.720
 What could anybody
 possibly gain

13:26.720 --> 13:29.000
 by claiming to be
 your parents?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.120
 A lifetime
 of free consultations?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.560
 But seriously, folks...

13:32.560 --> 13:34.320
 Oh...you got a package.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.360
 Bingo!

13:35.360 --> 13:37.320
 Had this zapped
 to me.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.120
 My best friend Dogger works
 at the archives in Sacramento.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.120
 I asked him to send   everything
 available   on my real parents.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.520
 What are they?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.960
 Louis and Helen Ehrlich.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.760
 OK, death certificates.
 So far, so good.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.640
 Traffic accident.
 This is all according to Hoyle.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.640
 I'm telling you,
 my real parents are dead.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.240
 OK...

14:00.240 --> 14:02.160
 Hah! California
 driver's licenses.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.160
 Pre-snapshot era.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.160
 OK. Ooh, passports.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.560
 Uh-oh.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.280
 Lech and Holga,
 alive and well.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.200
 Mrs Lopez has a fever of 102.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.680
 She's run-down,
 exhausted.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.600
 Gave birth
 two months ago,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.520
 her second
 in two years.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.000
 Could be
 bacterial pneumonia.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.840
 We should give her
 broad spectrum antibiotics.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.120
 Pneumonia?
 Maybe.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.520
 Her lungs
 are full of rhonchi.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.000
 Antibiotics
 are overkill.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.840
 Don't swamp her
 with mycins

14:40.840 --> 14:42.800
 until   the cultures   come back.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.200
 Let's try
 a saline IV.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.600
 and lower her fever with aspirin.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.040
 Do you think?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.000
 When I was
 a nurse,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.880
 I saw this
 100 times.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.880
 It's viral bronchitis.
 She'll shake it.
 We shouldn't   be bombing patients
 indiscriminately

14:57.080 --> 14:58.280
 with antibiotics.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.280
 Why use artillery
 when a roach motel will do?

15:10.280 --> 15:11.760
 I don't know.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.120
 It can't hurt
 to be cautious.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.560
 Elliot, up to you.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.000
 Yeah, it's
 your decision.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
 OK, we'll wait   for the lab   results.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.160
  KNOCK ON DOOR

15:38.960 --> 15:41.960
 What do I hate more than letters
 to the editor?

15:41.960 --> 15:45.960
 Waiting for
 a taxi at Logan.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.400
 Chablis?

15:53.400 --> 15:54.560
 Chardonnay.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.000
 When we were dating,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.880
 you'd always have a
 glass of white wine

15:58.880 --> 16:00.320
 before I came by.

16:00.320 --> 16:01.760
 I excited you.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.360
 Paris excited me.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.400
 How are the kids?

16:05.400 --> 16:07.800
 Donna is studying
 hard for exams

16:07.800 --> 16:09.680
 and Jim isn't.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.080
 Why should college
 change his life?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.120
 He'll get A's   like always.

16:14.120 --> 16:17.520
 He's taking next semester off
 to go out west.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.800
 What for?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.040
 Rock climbing.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.720
 El Capitan in Yosemite.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.040
 No, absolutely no.
 Out of the question.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.960
 You talk to him then.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.000
 I will.
 This is hot.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.400
 My favourite, little weenies
 in diapers.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.800
 What am I,
 cocktails for six?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.240
 Don't get
 too comfortable.

16:36.240 --> 16:40.080
 We have one half hour to get
 to Symphony Hall.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.200
 Mahler.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.320
 Mahler?

16:42.320 --> 16:45.080
 You like Mahler.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.200
 In theory.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.000
 Is there time to shave?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.440
 If you hurry.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.960
 OK.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.360
 How is work?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.760
 Oh, such
 an exciting week.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.760
 Big series on boondoggle
 and pork barrel.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.520
 Op-ed is where
 the action is.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.040
 I missed you.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.040
 Me, too.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.200
 Terrific crab, Holga.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.599
 Thank you.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.040
 When you said
 home-cooked meal,

17:24.040 --> 17:27.079
 I thought beans
 and franks.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.600
 Takes me back.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.880
 Lech, we never
 had paella

17:30.880 --> 17:32.240
 on the Isle of Pines.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.200
 It's the yellow rice.
 Arroz amarillo.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.360
 Don't show off.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.840
 Isle of Pines.
 You were there?

17:37.840 --> 17:40.280
 Yeah, for more
 than 20 years.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.280
 Is that a Club Med?

17:42.280 --> 17:45.680
 You're running a resort
 and couldn't send a postcard?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.880
 No day at the beach.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.680
 Victor, don't
 suck your crab.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.840
 Yes, ma'am.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.680
 Wait a minute,
 you're not my mother, OK?

17:53.680 --> 17:55.640
 Stop beating around
 the bouillabaisse

17:55.640 --> 17:57.080
 and start lying.

17:57.080 --> 18:01.080
 So you don't know
 about the Isle of Pines?

18:02.960 --> 18:06.960
 Bay of Pigs
 ring a bell?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.560
 Luther, they said
 you were working.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.400
 Polly, you look nice.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
 I got a job
 packing books.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.080
 That's terrific.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.800
 What are you doing here?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.640
 I wanted the doctor to
 change my medication,

18:27.640 --> 18:29.800
 but he wouldn't.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.200
 Everything OK?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.600
 Sure.
 I'm not spitting

18:32.600 --> 18:35.600
 or whooping
 or swearing, am I?

18:35.600 --> 18:37.920
 And no more uncontrollable
 racial slurs?

18:37.920 --> 18:40.520
 No, but...

18:40.520 --> 18:42.160
 What?

18:42.160 --> 18:44.480
 Luther...

18:44.480 --> 18:46.880
 I miss the
 Tourette's Syndrome.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.280
 The Haldol makes
 me feel like

18:49.280 --> 18:51.160
 I'm living
 in slow motion.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.000
 After 30 years
 of behaving one way,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.040
 you need
 time to adjust.

18:56.040 --> 19:00.040
 I'm going off the Haldol
 for a day or two.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.640
 Not unless you're
 under medical supervision.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.080
 You could
 supervise me.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.760
 You're almost
 a doctor.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.160
 I'm a physician's
 assistant.

19:07.160 --> 19:11.160
 Polly, please don't
 go off the medicine.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.200
 I need to be
 quick again.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.440
 Fast.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.280
 When I was living
 on the streets,

19:20.280 --> 19:23.840
 I loved to drum
 with my hands.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.280
 You were good.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.800
 Not twitchy and
 played in rhythm.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.800
 I bought a conga with
 my first paycheck.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.240
 I wanted one for years.

19:34.240 --> 19:37.160
 Except now I don't
 feel like playing.

19:37.160 --> 19:40.320
 I'm not any happier
 than I was before.

19:40.320 --> 19:44.320
 I'd feel safer
 if you were with me.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.800
 Did you use my razor
 on your legs?

19:51.800 --> 19:53.240
 Yes, I'm sorry.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.120
 There's some new
 blades in your drawer.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.880
 A drawer,
 a shelf in the
 medicine cabinet,

19:58.880 --> 20:01.720
 part of the closet.
 Home away from home.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.480
 What are you
 complaining about?

20:03.480 --> 20:05.880
 Nothing.

20:05.880 --> 20:07.000
 Mahler maybe.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.440
  PHONE

20:08.440 --> 20:09.720
 Keim, here.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.960
 Yes.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.280
 I'll be right over.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.240
 Don't tell me.
 Somebody's dying.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.080
 Mrs Klein has gone
 into respiratory arrest.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.520
 OK, go ahead.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.480
 I'm not dying,
 just tired.

20:21.480 --> 20:23.600
 I shouldn't be
 too long.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.480
 I'm afraid we're
 going to miss
 the concert.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.040
 What a disappointment.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.480
 Tomorrow night
 the Bruins.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.480
 Now you're talking.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.520
 I should have married
 a dermatologist.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.520
 I'll be back soon.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.120
 April 17, 1961.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.520
 We trained rebels
 for the company.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.360
 She's an expert in
 hand-to-hand combat.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.800
 Mano a mano.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.720
 I still have
 my brown belt.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.680
 We parachuted
 with the invasion.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.280
 A botched operation.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.120
 Your father's flair
 for understatement.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.560
 We were captured,
 imprisoned,

20:59.560 --> 21:02.480
 and sent to
 the Isle of Pines.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.560
 Tortured?

21:03.560 --> 21:05.680
 Don't ask.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.520
 The company arranged
 the death certificates,
 name changes...

21:08.520 --> 21:09.960
 Please don't
 remind me.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.360
 Bernie Oseransky
 is a beautiful name.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.800
 In December of 1962,

21:13.800 --> 21:17.160
 the Cuban rebels
 were traded to
 the United States

21:17.160 --> 21:20.040
 for 53 million
 in food and medicines,

21:20.040 --> 21:21.480
 but not us.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.880
 The company couldn't
 acknowledge our presence.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.720
 We were Castro's
 ace in the hole.

21:26.720 --> 21:30.720
 Finally, a deal
 was sealed for us,
 25 years later.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.840
 The company agreed
 to stop

21:32.840 --> 21:35.240
 all their crazy schemes
 against Castro...

21:35.240 --> 21:38.080
 hiring the Mafia
 to bump him off

21:38.080 --> 21:40.480
 and making his beard
 fall out.

21:40.480 --> 21:43.360
 Plus, they built
 Fidel a fertiliser
 processing plant.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.280
 I don't
 care about
 fertiliser.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.680
 Why didn't you
 let me know
 you were alive?

21:48.680 --> 21:50.560
 We never thought
 we'd get out.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.440
 You were better off
 thinking we were dead.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.320
 We never
 forgot about you.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.240
 Our salaries went
 to your Aunt Charice.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.080
 That's how she put you
 through medical school.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.000
 When you were
 horsing around
 with Carolyn Stolper,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.440
 your mother and I

22:05.440 --> 22:08.280
 were chopping sugar cane
 and rolling cigars.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.200
 How did you
 know about me
 and Carolyn?

22:11.200 --> 22:12.640
 Trade secret.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.520
 Oh, Lech,
 don't kid Victor.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.920
 That's not a classified
 intelligence, dear.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.920
 There are some things
 that a mother just knows.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.680
 No, no, no,
 please.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.680
 I'm still
 not buying.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.640
 We gave her
 some morphine
 for the pain.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.640
 She's as
 comfortable as
 we can make her.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.840
 Will...

22:42.840 --> 22:45.680
 will she come out
 of the coma?

22:45.680 --> 22:47.040
 Will she wake?

22:47.040 --> 22:51.040
 She's close
 to the end.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.360
 Anita always
 listens to me.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.240
 Who's going
 to listen to me now?

22:57.240 --> 23:01.240
 I told the cab driver
 three times where
 I was going.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.200
 He didn't hear me.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.360
 My voice is shot.

23:06.360 --> 23:10.360
 Do you mind if...if
 I hang around until...

23:14.000 --> 23:16.720
 I can't go home.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.080
 There's nobody there.

23:18.080 --> 23:22.080
 Of course
 you can stay.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.480
 Good night,
 Mr Klein.

23:26.480 --> 23:27.760
 Thank you.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.200
 Thank you, Dr Kiem.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.760
 Excuse me.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.600
 Would you
 mind waiting
 for a moment?

23:34.600 --> 23:38.440
 Thank you, Phillip.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.320
 What can I do
 for you, Mr Klein?

23:41.320 --> 23:43.240
 Wait just
 a little while.

23:43.240 --> 23:46.920
 I want to read
 to Anita.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.320
 And I don't
 trust my voice.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.760
 It may give out.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.160
 I want to finish
 the chapter.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.080
 Maybe you could
 help me.

23:55.080 --> 23:59.080
 Of course,
 I'll be glad to.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.080
 "The sun was warm
 and tender

24:10.080 --> 24:12.960
 "and the glory of
 the Georgia spring

24:12.960 --> 24:16.960
 was spread before
 her eyes."

24:26.880 --> 24:29.760
 Dr Westphall, do you
 remember Mrs Lopez?

24:29.760 --> 24:32.160
 Yes. I saw her
 on rounds.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.560
 Fever, heavy cough,
 exhaustion.
 What's wrong?

24:34.560 --> 24:36.000
 Her temperature
 is soaring.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.840
 Dr Axelrod
 is waiting for
 the lab report

24:38.840 --> 24:41.720
 to tell him
 it's pneumonia.
 It is.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.160
 I'll look at her.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.160
 When you see Axelrod,
 aim him toward my office.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.040
  # FUNK

24:54.040 --> 24:58.040
 Come on in.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.640
 # See the girl
 with the diamond ring

25:00.640 --> 25:03.640
 # She knows how to shake
 and sing, all right #

25:03.640 --> 25:06.240
 No Mongo Santamaria,
 but not bad.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.360
 Hi, Luther!

25:08.360 --> 25:09.520
 Feeling good?

25:09.520 --> 25:11.400
 Yeah, the Haldol's
 worn off.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.720
 I feel light, fast.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.560
 The rhythm's back.
 I'm not spitting
 or swearing.

25:15.560 --> 25:16.920
 I'm OK. I'm myself.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.880
 Don't let me
 stop you.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.880
 Go ahead. Hit it.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.800
 Mr Klein.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.920
 Dr Kiem,

25:37.920 --> 25:40.680
 thank you for being
 with us last night,

25:40.680 --> 25:43.920
 for staying with her
 until she died.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.240
 I was happy
 to do that.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.080
 The nurse told me
 that your husband
 is in town.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.520
 Bet he missed you.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.520
 He came from DC.

25:53.520 --> 25:54.880
 Kevin didn't mind.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.760
 Anita and I,
 52 years,

25:56.760 --> 26:00.120
 and I can count
 the fingers on
 one hand

26:00.120 --> 26:02.960
 the nights we were
 ever separated.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.280
 Kevin and I are
 often separated.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.760
 You can stand that?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.600
 We get used to it.

26:08.600 --> 26:12.600
 I could never get
 used to being alone.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.040
  KNOCK ON DOOR

26:15.040 --> 26:16.720
 Oh, bad time?

26:16.720 --> 26:20.040
 Yes.

26:20.040 --> 26:23.800
 Do you have family?

26:23.800 --> 26:24.920
 No.

26:24.920 --> 26:28.640
 We were all the family
 we ever needed.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.040
 Can you hear me?

26:30.040 --> 26:32.120
 Yes, perfectly.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.000
 My voice sounds
 so far away to me,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.600
 like I got
 off an airplane.

26:37.600 --> 26:41.600
 But Dr Kiem, you sound
 so far away, too.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.160
 If you ever need
 someone to talk to,

26:45.160 --> 26:48.440
 please call me.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.440
 I will do that.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.560
 Goodbye, doctor.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.760
 You know, uh...

26:59.760 --> 27:03.600
 one of the last
 things she said
 to me was...

27:03.600 --> 27:06.000
 "Harry, you're mad...

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
 "because I'm going
 someplace without you
 for a change,

27:12.240 --> 27:15.920
 and it's high time."

27:15.920 --> 27:17.360
 Oh, God in heaven.

27:17.360 --> 27:19.840
 What will I do
 without her?

27:19.840 --> 27:21.280
 How will I live?

27:21.280 --> 27:25.280
 Where will I go?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.520
 Please forgive me.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.640
 I'm sorry.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.560
 I just didn't
 mean to...

27:31.560 --> 27:35.560
 Forgive me, please.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.680
 I love those.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.080
 You made me splatter
 Winter Wonderland.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.000
 How long have
 you been there?

27:53.000 --> 27:56.840
 Paperweights
 with snow and Santa.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.200
 They always say
 holidays to me.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.600
 He's collecting
 fingerprints, Lech.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.560
 That's where
 all the drinking
 glasses went.

28:04.560 --> 28:07.440
 If it's prints
 you want, just ask.

28:07.440 --> 28:10.320
 We'll do anything
 to prove you're ours.

28:10.320 --> 28:13.440
 You'll accept
 thumbprints,
 I assume.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.920
 There we are.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.320
 Check these with
 the California DMV.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.920
 Write
 to Sacramento.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.320
 I already have.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.240
 Our old passports.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.120
 Not a very flattering
 photo of you, Lech.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.240
 Clever kid.

28:26.240 --> 28:29.120
 You got the makings
 of a good operative.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.040
 These prove
 we're your parents.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.920
 The absentee
 ballots aren't in.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.600
 I'm sending these
 to the FBI.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.000
 Name the director
 of the Bureau.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.440
 Haven't a clue.

28:39.440 --> 28:40.800
 Neither have I.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.160
 If you're my parents,
 why did you run off

28:44.160 --> 28:46.720
 to Central America
 to play spy?

28:46.720 --> 28:49.840
 We had a duty
 to our country.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.720
 What about your kids?

28:51.720 --> 28:54.640
 We never dreamed
 we couldn't come home.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.520
 If you're not
 my parents,

28:56.520 --> 28:58.000
 you're extremely
 sick individuals.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.440
 If you are
 my parents,

28:59.440 --> 29:02.320
 why did you bother
 to come back?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.240
 I knew this
 wouldn't work.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.560
 We came as soon
 as they let us out.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.000
 I begged
 for furlough.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.280
 We're supposed
 to be in Nicaragua.

29:11.280 --> 29:12.720
 I can't take this.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.720
 Just one more
 night. Then O-U-T.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.280
 Elliot, hear
 the bad news?

29:26.280 --> 29:27.400
 No, what?

29:27.400 --> 29:29.320
 Mrs Lopez
 took a dive
 last night.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.720
 What happened?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.160
 Temperature shot up.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.120
 The cultures came back,
 pneumococcal pneumonia.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.040
 Westphall put
 her on a broad
 spectrum regime.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.880
 She's responding.
 Looks like
 she'll be OK.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.480
 What a relief.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.720
 Westphall wants
 to see you.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.440
 Oh, no.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.320
 He's probably
 torquing himself
 into a corkscrew.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.320
 It's too bad.
 You made a good call.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.480
 Look, don't
 patronise me.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.640
 What?

29:56.640 --> 30:00.480
 You think of me
 as some dumb, fat
 aquarium plant.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.400
 Every time
 you look at me,

30:02.400 --> 30:04.800
 I'm a tube
 of hair food.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.680
 I knew
 Mrs Lopez had
 bacterial pneumonia,

30:07.680 --> 30:10.080
 and I let you
 and Novino

30:10.080 --> 30:12.920
 talk me out
 of my diagnosis.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.920
 I'm sorry.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.440
 No.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.480
 What?

30:19.480 --> 30:21.760
 I don't accept
 your apology.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.160
 Why are you
 so upset, Elliot?

30:24.160 --> 30:26.080
 The worse
 that can happen

30:26.080 --> 30:28.960
 is Westphall
 pulls the plug
 on your career,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.840
 you limp home
 and settle
 into a life

30:31.840 --> 30:35.840
 of spaying cats
 at the pound.

30:38.440 --> 30:42.440
 I was just
 trying to help.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.600
  KNOCK AT DOOR

30:46.880 --> 30:47.840
 Fine.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.400
 I should be home
 around 7:00.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.440
 We'll take it
 from there, OK?

30:53.440 --> 30:57.120
 Bye.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.040
 You look beat,
 my friend.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.320
 So do you.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.200
 I haven't been tired
 since medical school.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.640
 How was the symphony?

31:04.640 --> 31:07.360
 Didn't go.
 I've been here
 with Anita Klein.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.280
 She died early
 this morning.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.960
 Haven't even
 been home.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.240
 That was Kevin.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.440
 He's mad
 and threatening
 to leave today.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.320
 To tell
 you the truth,

31:19.320 --> 31:22.040
 I'm so tired,
 I don't even care.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.960
 I hope he stays,
 Paulette.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.840
 Time together
 should be treasured.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.560
 We don't know how much
 time we have left.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.000
 When my wife died,

31:31.000 --> 31:32.920
 I remembered
 every cross word,

31:32.920 --> 31:34.360
 every wasted moment,

31:34.360 --> 31:35.800
 every lost opportunity.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.720
 Harry and Anita Klein
 were inseparable.

31:38.720 --> 31:42.200
 They fit together
 like Chinese boxes.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.720
 52 years.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.600
 Vintage marriage
 is very rare.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.600
 I envy them.

31:50.720 --> 31:54.720
 But now I've got
 to be in OR.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.680
 Ha!

32:06.680 --> 32:07.760
 Polly.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.160
 When I was
 on the streets,

32:10.160 --> 32:14.160
 I loved the rhythm
 of the dryer...

32:14.160 --> 32:15.760
 and the washer...

32:15.760 --> 32:17.160
 spin...

32:17.160 --> 32:19.920
 I think we should
 get something to eat.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.120
 We've been out all day.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.560
 Take it easy, OK?

32:24.560 --> 32:25.960
 Just take it easy.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.200
 Oh! Ha!

32:27.200 --> 32:28.240
 Just relax.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.160
 Hey! Hey,
 what's going on?

32:30.160 --> 32:32.120
 No. She has
 Tourette's syndrome.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.240
 I'm calling the cops.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.840
 I want you out.

32:34.840 --> 32:35.920
 She's sick.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.080
 I don't need this.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.760
 Drip-dry
 someplace else.

32:38.760 --> 32:41.080
 Hey, these don't
 belong to us.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.520
 Are you OK?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.480
 Yeah.

32:43.480 --> 32:45.080
 Take it easy, Polly.

32:45.080 --> 32:49.080
 Slow down, Polly.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.720
 Polly.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.640
 How long have
 you been here?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.080
 An hour. Two.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.520
 You look prunish.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.920
 Be sure to replenish
 your fluids.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.920
 Yes, sir.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.480
 What are you
 sulking about?

33:18.480 --> 33:21.280
 I'm plucking
 a mental daisy.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.080
 They are my parents,
 they aren't my parents.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.800
 There must be
 some way to find out.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.960
 Even if they are
 who they say they are,

33:29.960 --> 33:31.320
 who'll confirm
 their existence?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.640
 Both a couple
 of stress fractures.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.400
 Crazy as baffle plates.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.440
 Which tends to indicate
 you are related.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.280
 Maybe Aunt Charice
 or my sibs can
 shed some light...

33:42.280 --> 33:44.680
 if I ever
 see them again.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.560
 I may never
 know for sure.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.920
 Not easy
 being a son,

33:49.920 --> 33:51.400
 or a father.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.280
 All the years I spent
 in this hospital

33:54.280 --> 33:58.280
 Stephen held against me.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.600
 Never even tried
 to understand why
 we were separated.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.800
 Then after we lost him

34:04.800 --> 34:08.800
 there was no way to ever
 make the world the same.

34:11.120 --> 34:15.120
 I hope
 Lech and Holga
 are my folks.

34:15.199 --> 34:18.719
 I want parents.

34:18.719 --> 34:22.719
 I'd like to be
 somebody's son.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.440
 Come on, Ehrlich.
 Stop.

34:29.440 --> 34:33.440
 Dr Craig?

34:33.760 --> 34:37.400
 Could I please
 have a hug?

34:37.400 --> 34:38.360
 Um...

34:38.360 --> 34:39.960
 listen, Ehrlich.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.960
 Men don't hug
 other men in steam rooms.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.120
 Except on Masterpiece Theatre.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.920
 Why don't you just
 go play some handball,

34:49.920 --> 34:53.920
 and that will get
 your endorphins cooking.

35:02.520 --> 35:04.760
 Yeah?

35:04.760 --> 35:08.760
 Sit down.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.160
 Dr Westphall...

35:14.160 --> 35:16.280
 I won't listen
 to any excuses.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.600
 You treated
 Mrs Lopez like
 she had jewellery rash.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.000
 You're lucky Papandrao
 caught your mistake.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.920
 I felt she had pneumonia.
 I wanted to make sure.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.320
 There isn't
 always time

35:27.320 --> 35:29.720
 for labs to confirm
 your suspicions.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.360
 You have to have
 the courage to trust
 your instincts.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.680
 Trust your
 clinical skills.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.520
 Courage,
 trust instincts, yes.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.720
 I understand Novino
 and Griffin participated
 in this decision?

35:40.720 --> 35:42.640
 Mrs Lopez was my call.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.080
 I was in charge.

35:44.080 --> 35:46.200
 I have to live
 with the consequences.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.720
 All right.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.160
 You see, Dr Westphall...

35:49.160 --> 35:51.120
 Look...
 I said OK, Elliot.

35:51.120 --> 35:54.080
 Quit while
 you're ahead.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.520
 Am I ahead?

35:55.520 --> 35:56.920
 For the moment.

35:56.920 --> 36:00.920
 Oh.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.440
 She's responding
 well to the Haldol.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.720
 You're doing fine.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.680
 Sure.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.680
 Whoop!

36:16.680 --> 36:20.680
 I was just kidding.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.160
 Luther, let's talk.

36:23.160 --> 36:27.160
 See you later.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.360
 How did it happen?

36:31.360 --> 36:34.800
 Polly wanted
 to experience
 life without Haldol.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.200
 You agreed to that?

36:36.200 --> 36:39.160
 She was going
 to go off it anyway.

36:39.160 --> 36:41.400
 This way,
 I was with her.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.080
 She made good progress
 with the medication.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.800
 If you mean she no
 longer bothers people,

36:46.800 --> 36:47.800
 you're right.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.200
 But Polly's unhappy.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.720
 What if the drug
 makes her dead inside?

36:51.720 --> 36:54.160
 Polly's used to being
 constantly manic.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.280
 She needs help
 adjusting to her
 emotional changes.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.000
 What about
 what she wants?

36:59.000 --> 37:02.800
 You have to learn
 that what's best
 for the patient

37:02.800 --> 37:04.720
 isn't always
 what they want.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.600
 Who gives us
 the right to decide?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.280
 What about
 personal freedom?

37:09.280 --> 37:11.120
 Free will...

37:11.120 --> 37:14.400
 Often our behaviour is
 just a matter of chemistry.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.560
 Blood sugar, hormones...

37:17.560 --> 37:20.400
 If the chemicals in
 our brain are unbalanced,

37:20.400 --> 37:22.760
 we become prisoners
 to irrational impulses.

37:22.760 --> 37:26.760
 We have to care
 for those who aren't
 in control of themselves.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.960
 They can't do
 as they please.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.240
 Polly never
 hurt anybody.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.520
 Except herself.

37:32.520 --> 37:33.800
 True.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.720
 I saw that
 happen today.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.160
 She couldn't
 stop herself.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.720
 She couldn't
 help herself.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.720
 Then it's up to us
 to help her.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.120
 How'd it go
 with Westphall?

37:50.120 --> 37:52.520
 Does he want
 to see me?

37:52.520 --> 37:55.400
 See you? Mrs Lopez
 was my patient.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.760
 Thanks for covering.
 It took guts.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.200
 Don't flatter yourself.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.080
 I wasn't covering,
 and I don't have guts.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.000
 I did learn something.

38:04.000 --> 38:04.960
 What?

38:04.960 --> 38:06.080
 I'm alone.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.520
 All doctors are alone.

38:07.520 --> 38:11.360
 And if you screw up,
 screw up your own way.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.760
 The situation could
 have been reversed.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.200
 What does matter was,

38:15.200 --> 38:17.120
 I didn't
 believe in myself.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.560
 It won't happen again.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.000
 You're not
 alone, Elliot.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
 Tell me another
 one, Novino.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.680
 I just have to put
 the little umbrellas in.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.960
 Parasols, dear.

38:35.960 --> 38:39.640
 For a woman who's been
 out of circulation 25 years,

38:39.640 --> 38:42.040
 your mother moves
 are pretty sharp.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.000
 Hey!

38:43.000 --> 38:45.080
 Oh, my.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.200
 Wow.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.160
 How festive.

38:47.160 --> 38:48.600
 Thank you.

38:48.600 --> 38:51.480
 I think I'd like
 to propose a toast.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.440
 Good.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.520
 To our son,
 Victor Ehrlich.

38:54.520 --> 38:57.120
 Salud, dinero,
 y amor.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.560
 Y tiempo
 para gustarlos.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.680
 Which means?

39:00.680 --> 39:02.200
 Health, money, and love.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.640
 And time to enjoy them.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.480
 Fantastic. Cheers.

39:06.480 --> 39:10.480
 Cheers.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.840
 Oh. Sweet.

39:15.840 --> 39:16.880
 Cuba libres.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.320
 Rum and coke.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.440
 Very good.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.880
 Seemed apropos.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.200
 Uh, listen.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.280
 Lech, Holga...

39:23.280 --> 39:26.000
 I didn't mean that
 about kicking you out.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.040
 Stay as long
 as you like.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.800
 Very kind of you.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.000
 Are you going to visit
 the other kids?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.600
 Well, that was
 our original plan.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.480
 But now that
 we realise

39:37.480 --> 39:40.400
 what havoc
 we've wreaked
 in your life...

39:40.400 --> 39:42.920
 We've been
 thinking of returning
 to Central America.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.400
 We don't
 belong here.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.800
 Our visit's been
 so hard on you.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.160
 No. The fact is, I have
 been totally selfish,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.000
 wrapped up in
 my own self-pity.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.840
 Prison must have been
 terrible for you.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.360
 Wasn't too
 many laughs.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.200
 Imagine how I felt
 separated from my children.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.600
 Not seeing them grow up.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.720
 I'm sorry.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.320
 So are we.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.760
 All I'm trying
 to say is,

40:07.760 --> 40:10.120
 let's get to know
 each other.

40:10.120 --> 40:13.960
 Do you really have
 to destabilise some
 unfriendly regime?

40:13.960 --> 40:15.400
 We'll see.

40:15.400 --> 40:19.400
 OK.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.720
 Donna will meet you.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.160
 Was Steve Berman there?

40:25.160 --> 40:26.120
 Yes.

40:26.120 --> 40:27.640
 I'm worried
 about them.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.000
 What?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
 You had that talk,
 didn't you?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.400
 Years ago. She's 17.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.120
 She knows more
 than you at that age.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.400
 When I ask her
 about Steve,

40:39.400 --> 40:41.320
 she stares
 at the ground.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.920
 I'm no good
 as a single parent.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.400
 Don't tell me that.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.680
 You are not
 a single parent.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.200
 They see me
 as much as ever.

40:50.200 --> 40:52.000
 Unfortunately,
 that's true.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.720
 We were looking forward
 to seeing you more.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.160
 Your presence is fading.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.560
 You blow in
 every two weeks!

40:58.560 --> 41:02.560
 We don't know if you're
 a guest or a ghost.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.280
 Do you want me
 to give this up?

41:05.280 --> 41:06.400
 No...

41:06.400 --> 41:08.200
 you need your work.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.080
 You didn't marry
 a housewife.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.360
 True.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.200
 I never wanted to
 come home from work

41:14.200 --> 41:18.200
 and be told
 how many times
 the cat threw up.

41:20.280 --> 41:22.120
 I brought up
 two children.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.880
 We brought up
 two children.

41:23.880 --> 41:25.920
 Nobody got short-changed,
 did they?

41:25.920 --> 41:28.440
 No...

41:28.440 --> 41:32.120
 to the contrary.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.000
 I was thinking about
 that cafe in Montmartre.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.840
 I remember
 that night you
 pounded on the tables

41:38.840 --> 41:41.240
 screaming, "I will
 not be ordinary.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.600
 I've come too far
 to be ordinary."

41:44.600 --> 41:46.560
 You got what you wanted.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.440
 Like Scarlett O'Hara?

41:48.440 --> 41:51.760
 More like Madame Nhu.

41:51.760 --> 41:55.760
 Why don't you
 stay the night?

41:57.520 --> 42:01.520
 I always hate
 the last long goodbye.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.560
 The person on
 the way out saying,

42:04.560 --> 42:06.480
 "Well, I've got to go."

42:06.480 --> 42:08.400
 The person
 staying thinking,

42:08.400 --> 42:11.560
 "Leave, so I can
 return to my life."

42:11.560 --> 42:14.800
 I'm not thinking that.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.200
 See you next week.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.280
 Two weeks.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.600
 Two weeks. Right.

42:19.600 --> 42:23.600
 I'll get tickets
 for the Kennedy Centre.

42:34.440 --> 42:38.440
 Now get out of here.

42:49.320 --> 42:50.280
 Need a lift?

42:50.280 --> 42:51.240
 Just psychologically.

42:51.240 --> 42:55.240
 This is a very
 depressing place.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.600
 Luther.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.760
 Hi, Polly.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.440
 Feeling better?

43:05.440 --> 43:06.880
 Yeah. I guess so.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.960
 I'm sorry about that
 scene in the Laundromat.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.320
 Could have
 got you in trouble.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.480
 No harm, no foul.

43:14.480 --> 43:16.320
 Glad you could catch me.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.200
 Looks like your medication
 ought to be full-time...

43:19.200 --> 43:20.360
 and permanent.

43:20.360 --> 43:22.080
 Yeah. I guess so.

43:22.080 --> 43:25.600
 Hope I can get used
 to feeling this slow.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.240
 Well, we'll find someone
 you can talk to

43:29.240 --> 43:31.480
 and help you with that.

43:31.480 --> 43:32.800
 Thanks.

43:32.800 --> 43:36.800
 Maybe I can figure out
 how to drum in slow motion.

43:38.720 --> 43:42.200
 Yeah.

43:42.200 --> 43:46.200
  DOOR CLOSES

44:13.880 --> 44:14.800
 Lech?

44:14.800 --> 44:18.800
 Holga?

45:00.800 --> 45:03.280
  HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRR

45:03.280 --> 45:04.880
 Mom?

45:04.880 --> 45:08.880
 Dad?

45:10.280 --> 45:11.720
 Mama!

45:11.720 --> 45:15.720
 Papa!

45:21.480 --> 45:24.520
 Papa.

45:24.520 --> 45:28.520
 Mama.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.400
 Ma.

45:51.400 --> 45:55.400
 Da.
