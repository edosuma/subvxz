00:05.600 --> 00:07.397
(footsteps approaching)

00:07.440 --> 00:10.204
This list you left
outside my door...

00:10.240 --> 00:12.470
"Item one:
Return Clyde to Watson."

00:13.680 --> 00:15.409
I enjoy his company
on the weekends;

00:15.440 --> 00:16.338
she has him during the week.

00:16.380 --> 00:18.177
I_don't care how
you dIVIde up your turtle.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.314
I care that you're asking me
to take him to Chelsea.

00:20.350 --> 00:23.114
Part of our arrangement,
you will recall,

00:23.150 --> 00:25.618
is that you assist with
quotidian matters when I'm busy.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.153
"Busy?" You're watching
a turtle eat lettuce.

00:28.190 --> 00:30.055
I'm conducting medical research.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.092
Remember, I cut my hand

00:32.130 --> 00:33.324
_ while we were
dissecting that cadaver?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.191
I'm tending to
the wound as we speak.

00:35.230 --> 00:37.164
I'm also demonstrating
that leeches

00:37.200 --> 00:38.622
_can be useful
In accelerating

00:38.670 --> 00:41.195
the repair of damaged tissue.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.231
That is disgusting.
You're bleeding yourself.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.409
And you are perpetuating
a long-held prejudice

00:45.440 --> 00:46.668
against these creatures.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.200
(doorbell rings)
If you say so.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.208
I'm still not taking your turtle
on the subway.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.547
If that's for me,

00:51.580 --> 00:53.070
I'm going to need
a few minutes.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.270
I'm feeling
a bit faint.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.178
So, sorry, I was a bit
distracted upstairs.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.414
I didn't catch your name.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.189
Edwin Borstein.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.254
I have a friend

01:03.290 --> 01:05.281
from London who's
used you before.

01:05.330 --> 01:06.649
He said you're excellent.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.292
And discreet.

01:08.330 --> 01:11.822
Why have you need
of my discretion?

01:11.870 --> 01:13.269
I run a software company.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.165
We specialize in
AI applications.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.508
I assume
you know that

01:16.540 --> 01:18.132
that stands for
"artIfICIal Intelligence."

01:18.170 --> 01:20.434
Yes, I'm well-acquainted
with the field.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.402
A couple of nights ago,
someone broke into our lab.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.406
They made a copy of a program

01:24.450 --> 01:25.678
that we've been
workIng on.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.246
I rigged the computer
to take a photo

01:27.280 --> 01:28.508
every time
it's booted up,

01:28.550 --> 01:30.745
just in case something
like this happened.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.281
So I have a picture.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.548
Kind of.

01:36.490 --> 01:38.185
HOLMES:
So there was a burglary.

01:38.230 --> 01:39.595
You've got a picture
of the criminal.

01:39.630 --> 01:42.190
Seems like the police should
have this well in hand.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.460
This program...

01:44.500 --> 01:46.092
it's significant.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.766
We call it "Bella."

01:49.810 --> 01:53.177
Its AI engine
is... unique.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.768
It... she...

01:54.810 --> 01:56.277
performs better than

01:56.310 --> 01:58.301
anything you've ever
seen, I promise.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.671
She performs better
than we expected her to.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.540
Explain that.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.411
A few weeks back,
she made a request

02:05.450 --> 02:08.214
that can't be accounted for
by her programming.

02:08.260 --> 02:09.682
Impossible.

02:09.730 --> 02:10.924
What's impossible?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.325
For the computer
to ask for something?

02:12.360 --> 02:13.759
If it made a
request, it did so

02:13.800 --> 02:15.290
because that's what it
was programmed to do.

02:15.330 --> 02:18.697
He's claiming true
machine intelligence.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.197
If he's correct
in his claims,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.935
he has made
a scientific breakthrough

02:21.970 --> 02:25.337
of the very highest order.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.270
Bella isn't hooked up
to a network.

02:27.310 --> 02:28.800
It's a security thing.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.876
If she has data,
it's because we fed it to her.

02:30.910 --> 02:34.243
But two weeks ago,
I booted her up

02:34.280 --> 02:37.340
and she asked to be connected
to the Internet.

02:37.390 --> 02:40.279
And how, pray tell,

02:40.320 --> 02:42.959
does your software know
that the Internet even exists?

02:42.990 --> 02:45.185
She could have intuited
its eXIstence

02:45.230 --> 02:46.254
from data fed to her.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.757
Bunkum.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.360
There is no such thing as
"artificial intelligence."

02:51.400 --> 02:53.391
At least not in the sense
you're talking about.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.362
It's all just
clever programming.

02:55.400 --> 02:56.367
I don't think so.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.207
Not with Bella.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.503
KITTY:
I still don't understand.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.245
So are you going to rip open

03:04.280 --> 03:06.874
the computer and
look at all the wires?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.319
Something called a "Turing Test"

03:08.350 --> 03:10.341
is routinely issued
in AI labs.

03:10.390 --> 03:11.914
_ An examiner sits
in front a computer,

03:11.950 --> 03:13.759
poses a series of questions

03:13.790 --> 03:16.281
until he or she can determine
whether the answers have come

03:16.330 --> 03:18.355
from a human or from a computer.

03:18.390 --> 03:20.722
Until very recently,
no machine has ever passed.

03:20.760 --> 03:21.988
And now one has?

03:22.030 --> 03:23.566
Partially.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.388
A program named "Eugene
Goostman" was designed to mimic

03:27.440 --> 03:29.908
the responses of a 13-year-old
boy from Eastern Europe.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.238
It fooled some of its examiners.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.599
Now, in the case of Bella,

03:33.640 --> 03:35.278
we know there's no human
in the equation,

03:35.310 --> 03:36.846
so ifI can trap it
into giving responses

03:36.880 --> 03:39.348
that couldn't possibly
have come from a human...

03:39.380 --> 03:40.574
I'll have won.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.383
So, in other words,

03:42.420 --> 03:44.388
you don't really know
what you're going to do.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.012
This is my partner,

03:46.050 --> 03:47.779
Melinda Young.
Melinda, this is

03:47.820 --> 03:50.755
Sherlock Holmes and his,
uh, protg, Kitty Winter.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.429
Mr. Holmes would like time
with Bella.

03:53.460 --> 03:56.020
We wired the speakers
and microphones

03:56.060 --> 03:57.960
through that doll.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.389
You can go ahead.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.701
Right.

04:05.740 --> 04:07.731
(clears throat)

04:10.380 --> 04:11.608
(sighs)
Hello.

04:11.650 --> 04:13.413
BELLA (female voice):
Hello.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.686
Did you ask to be
connected to a network?

04:17.720 --> 04:18.948
Yes.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.355
Why?

04:20.390 --> 04:21.857
There is information there.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.484
Information is useful
to solve problems.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.328
Why is it useful?

04:27.360 --> 04:29.669
I don't understand the question.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.463
Could you tell me more?

04:31.500 --> 04:33.730
You stumped her. Are we done?

04:33.770 --> 04:35.362
The test isn't over

04:35.400 --> 04:36.799
because she's stumped.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.660
She's admitted
she doesn't know

04:38.710 --> 04:40.632
and that's within the range
of possible human behaviors,

04:40.680 --> 04:41.704
and therefore inconclusive.

04:45.610 --> 04:47.475
I would like to know
how you have arrived

04:47.520 --> 04:49.010
at the concept of "useful,"

04:49.050 --> 04:52.087
and how you have applied it
in this instance.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.486
I don't understand the question.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.522
Could you tell me more?

05:02.370 --> 05:04.588
I'm gonna need some time alone
with the machine.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.364
I don't understand the question.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.106
Could you tell me more?

05:10.140 --> 05:12.472
Yes, so you keep saying,

05:12.510 --> 05:14.569
ad nauseum.

05:14.610 --> 05:16.441
I would like
to understand

05:16.480 --> 05:19.108
how you became aware of
the existence of networks,

05:19.150 --> 05:20.742
and why you asked
to be connected.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.338
The existence of networks

05:22.390 --> 05:24.449
can be intuited from data sets

05:24.490 --> 05:25.912
that were presented as givens.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.350
There is information
on networks.

05:28.390 --> 05:31.553
Information is useful
for solvmg problems.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.524
What is your understanding
of the word "useful"?

05:33.560 --> 05:35.858
If a piece of data can help
solve a given problem,

05:35.900 --> 05:37.458
it is useful.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.537
Is that a definition
you came to on your own?

05:40.570 --> 05:42.401
I don't understand the question.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.509
Could you tell me more?

05:46.010 --> 05:48.001
Why don't you just admit
that all you're doing

05:48.040 --> 05:49.678
is following
your own programming?

05:49.710 --> 05:52.417
I don't understand the question.

05:52.450 --> 05:53.474
Could you tell me more?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.579
I'm taking a break.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.612
WATSON:
Everything okay?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.550
KITTY:
Thank you for coming.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.058
It's like I said
on the phone,

06:03.090 --> 06:04.887
he just won't stop.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.454
You got any ideas?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.456
(Holmes talking,
indistinct and muffled)

06:10.500 --> 06:12.639
You're not planning to destroy
the computer, are you?

06:12.670 --> 06:15.468
No, I'm not planning to destroy
the bloody computer.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.559
Just ride it out.
If he starts hitting things,

06:17.610 --> 06:18.634
_ use the fire _
extingUIsher on him.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.455
Is love real?

06:35.490 --> 06:37.788
I don't understand the question.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.957
Could I have more information?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.627
Love.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.764
Surely it's a human construct,

06:43.800 --> 06:46.121
a hedge against
the terror of mortality.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.467
I believe that.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.138
But that doesn't
account for times

06:49.170 --> 06:50.899
I've felt it itself.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.498
With my mother.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.679
Irene.

06:54.710 --> 06:57.941
Even, after a fashion,
with Watson.

06:57.980 --> 07:00.540
It vexes.

07:01.650 --> 07:02.878
Love is either a human construct

07:02.920 --> 07:04.581
or it's a real thing, right?

07:06.620 --> 07:08.554
I know, you need
more information.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.922
The question cannot be answered.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.723
The concept of "love" exists,

07:12.760 --> 07:15.888
therefore it is useful even
if it is a human construct.

07:15.930 --> 07:18.490
It exists because
it serves a need.

07:18.530 --> 07:21.067
A question that can
be answered might be,

07:21.100 --> 07:22.806
"Why is love needed?"

07:24.240 --> 07:26.606
Why is love needed?

07:26.640 --> 07:29.074
I don't understand the question.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.600
Could I have more information?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.780
HOLMES:
Call Edwin Borstein.

07:38.820 --> 07:40.685
Tell him I need to sleep
for a couple of hours

07:40.720 --> 07:42.529
and then I'll take on his case.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.551
Free of charge.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.894
Hey.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.692
You guys ready
to get started yet?

07:55.740 --> 07:57.867
Is he up?
He's awake.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.707
I don't know how much use
he's going to be, though.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.638
Hello.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.942
Hi.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.747
Um, isn't it a school day?

08:11.790 --> 08:13.212
I'm in college.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.613
HOLMES:
She can come in.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.557
Watson, this
is Mason.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.296
Like many of
his generation,

08:20.330 --> 08:21.649
he's named after a profession

08:21.700 --> 08:23.167
his parents would never
deign to practice:

08:23.200 --> 08:25.259
Hunter, Tanner, Cooper,
Mason, so forth.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.791
Yeah, like "Sherlock"
is such a great name.
In spite of that,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.229
he's done some significant work
in AI modeling.

08:30.270 --> 08:31.567
And these are some other
experts in the field.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.771
Experts, Watson.
Watson, experts.

08:33.810 --> 08:36.938
And they're
helping us how?

08:36.980 --> 08:39.141
We're devising a plan to
beat Bella, of course.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.614
I didn't prove that
the machine is engaging

08:41.650 --> 08:43.015
in some kind of
rudimentary thought,

08:43.050 --> 08:44.608
I just failed
to disprove it.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.949
Okay. Except our job is not
to "beat" the computer.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.981
Our job is to find out
who copied the program.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.692
Technically true.
But I'm not being paid,

08:52.730 --> 08:53.924
so I'm free to work
as the muse dictates.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.598
Borstein's
paying your fee,

08:55.630 --> 08:57.325
so you'd best get cracking.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.122
Good luck.
I have every confidence.

08:59.170 --> 09:00.592
Et cetera, et cetera.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.574
KI_'|'|'Y: Your man's
obVIously no amateur.

09:09.610 --> 09:11.840
He headed straight
for Bella.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.245
He didn't muck about,

09:13.280 --> 09:15.714
he knew what he was looking for.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.581
So, industrial espionage?

09:17.620 --> 09:20.111
He's a little bit too old

09:20.160 --> 09:21.787
to be playing cat burglar,
don't you think?

09:21.820 --> 09:23.128
Well, I don't know.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.787
It's hard to tell
behind the mask.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.354
Look at his neck.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.722
He's got liver spots coming in.
Tips of his teeth

09:28.760 --> 09:30.796
are stained-- he's a smoker;
a heavy one, I'm guessing.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.730
Okay, so we have an older guy

09:32.770 --> 09:34.192
who smokes about a pack a day.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.366
Does that help us?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.106
I'm not sure.
But like you said,

09:37.140 --> 09:39.028
he had to know that company
like the back of his hand.

09:39.070 --> 09:42.107
Which means that he
had to case the place.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.142
KITTY: What is it
we're looking for?

09:44.180 --> 09:46.375
Edwin B_or_stein's
company is in there.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.616
We want to find a spot

09:47.650 --> 09:49.117
where we can get
a good view.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.879
Someplace where
not too many

09:50.920 --> 09:53.650
people would bother you.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.056
So how did you feel

09:56.090 --> 09:58.126
after the, um, support group
meeting the other night?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.690
They said a lot about

10:01.730 --> 10:04.062
finding peace
and balance.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.091
Stuff like that.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.698
I don't know,
it's a little...

10:09.740 --> 10:11.332
confusing, really.

10:14.810 --> 10:16.698
I think they've had
a fire up there.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.638
WATSON:
Oh, yeah.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.318
Looks like a good
place to sit

10:20.350 --> 10:22.887
and watch the building
across the street.

10:31.390 --> 10:33.722
Perfect view of
Borstein's office.

10:46.810 --> 10:49.699
Gauloise.
Unfiltered.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.377
These'll leave a nasty
stain on your teeth.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.742
Right.
From this moment forward,

10:58.790 --> 11:00.018
no one must refer
to Bella as "she."

11:00.060 --> 11:01.880
Bella is an "it."

11:01.920 --> 11:04.127
We must not be lured by the
temptation to anthropomorphize.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.391
I really hope it didn't take
eight experts the whole morning

11:07.430 --> 11:08.590
to come up with that.

11:08.630 --> 11:11.019
We developed a number of
refinements on the Turing Test.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.732
It was a very stimulating
few hours. And you?

11:13.770 --> 11:15.738
Your message said you've been
out collecting cigarette butts.

11:15.770 --> 11:17.362
We think we found the place

11:17.410 --> 11:19.833
where the burglar staked out
Edwin Borstein's company.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.802
Marcus ran the DNA
on the butts.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.104
We didn't find a match,
though. Not exactly.

11:24.150 --> 11:28.371
Four years ago, someone broke
into the genetics lab in Harvard

11:28.420 --> 11:31.116
and stole the first written copy
of the entire human genome.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.879
The burglar cut himself
climbing through the window,

11:32.920 --> 11:34.751
and he left some blood behind

11:34.790 --> 11:36.883
which matched the DNA
that we found today.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.285
The witness saw the guy
driving away.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.298
Police in Cambridge
made a sketch.

11:41.330 --> 11:43.264
Yeah, we've been looking
through arrest photos,

11:43.300 --> 11:44.289
hoping to get luclq.

11:44.330 --> 11:45.297
His name is Raffles.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.764
You know him?

11:47.800 --> 11:50.132
His name's Raffles?
It's a nickname.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.877
Scotland Yard gave it to him
when he reminded somebody there

11:52.910 --> 11:55.936
of the gentleman thief
in the novels by E.W. Hornung.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.470
Raffles is a cat burglar
in Europe,

11:57.510 --> 11:59.239
active in the '905
and early aughts.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.249
I never pursued him, which might
explain why he was never caught.

12:02.280 --> 12:03.838
But they did arrest
one of his associates

12:03.890 --> 12:04.811
who gave them
the sketch of Raffles.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.044
And he looked like
this fellow.

12:06.090 --> 12:08.854
You_said he was
stealing paintings.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.926
He's going after pieces
of technology now.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.928
Why the change in MO?
I don't know.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.849
If we find out why, we'll be
closer to finding out who he is.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.367
with regards to Raffles.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.231
Oh, you're deigning
to join us now?

12:21.270 --> 12:24.103
I have a strategy to best Bella.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.903
She...

12:25.940 --> 12:27.532
it will not frustrate
my efforts again.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.036
And besides,
until five minutes ago,

12:29.080 --> 12:30.547
you were pursuing
a garden-variety burglar.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.775
Now you're after
Raffles himself.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.242
Of course I'm joining in.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.942
WATSON:
Food's almost done.

12:39.390 --> 12:41.119
Oh, sorry, I, um...

12:41.160 --> 12:42.559
I checked my inbox
before dinner.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.423
I've been on this really
interesting chain all day.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.791
Your former
partner, uh...

12:46.830 --> 12:48.559
current partner?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.465
Hard to keep track... Holmes.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.899
He emailed me this morning.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.364
He's working on some AI thing?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.799
Did he ask you for help?

12:55.840 --> 12:57.102
Uh, me and a bunch
of other people.

12:57.140 --> 12:58.869
He knows I got started
as a software developer.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.969
I guess you also told him
I sold off my company,

13:01.010 --> 13:03.342
so I've got
some free time.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.201
Some of the people on the chain,
they are seriously sharp.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.013
I went back and forth
with a few of them

13:08.050 --> 13:09.881
about AI, data havens...

13:09.920 --> 13:11.444
geek stuff.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.209
Has he asked you
for help before?

13:14.260 --> 13:16.216
No.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.888
It's not_ a_
problem, is it?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.921
No.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.238
Morning.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.033
No Kitty?

13:29.070 --> 13:30.901
She's tending
to a personal matter.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.477
Why did you ask me to meet
you at Burnett Technology?

13:33.510 --> 13:35.330
We're seeking an audience
with Robert Burnett,

13:35.380 --> 13:36.904
and he's the CEO.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.911
My investigations
yesterday revealed

13:39.950 --> 13:42.214
there have been half-dozen
or so notable thefts

13:42.250 --> 13:44.980
of new inv_entions
over the last eight years--

13:45.020 --> 13:46.851
all of them unsolved,

13:46.890 --> 13:48.949
but all of them bearing
the hallmark of Raffles.

13:48.990 --> 13:52.619
Now, I couldn't make sense
of this sudden change in method.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.322
It d_oesn't_track unless he's
been incentIVIzed in some way.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.089
Incentivized?

13:57.130 --> 13:59.860
I started to wonder if Raffles
had found himself a patron,

13:59.900 --> 14:02.368
someone who'd convinced him
to put his skill set to use

14:02.400 --> 14:03.958
in the cause of science.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.898
You think he
has a boss now?

14:05.940 --> 14:08.408
The list of people who'd be
interested in the kind of things

14:08.440 --> 14:10.977
that Raffles is stealing,
that's very large.

14:11.010 --> 14:13.012
But the subset of the list
who could actually afford

14:13.050 --> 14:14.017
to subsidize that pursuit,

14:14.050 --> 14:15.608
that's much smaller.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.140
And does that
include Robert Burnett?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.146
As it happens,

14:19.190 --> 14:21.158
Burnett hired himself
a new security consultant

14:21.190 --> 14:22.509
nine years ago.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.185
He reports directly
to the CEO.

14:26.230 --> 14:27.458
I think you'll find
he looks familiar.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.853
"Rupert Kerlich."

14:31.670 --> 14:34.434
Rupert Kerlich... is Raffles.

14:34.470 --> 14:36.199
You found Raffles.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.433
I'm sorry, Mr. Burnett wanted

14:39.470 --> 14:42.007
to ask one more time
what this is about.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.348
Tell him we're here
to discuss Raffles.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.945
So, you e-mailed Andrew.
I did.

14:47.980 --> 14:50.119
Was it because you're actually
interested in his opinion,

14:50.150 --> 14:51.640
or were you just
looking for an excuse

14:51.690 --> 14:53.157
to poke around
in my life?

14:53.190 --> 14:55.954
Andrew is a currently-unemployed
sobeare developer.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.548
He's not unemployed,
he sold his start-up--

14:57.590 --> 14:59.023
he's looking for
his next idea.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.254
"Looking for his next idea"

15:00.300 --> 15:01.597
is another way of saying
"he's unemployed."

15:01.630 --> 15:02.995
(scoffs)

15:03.030 --> 15:04.224
Anyway, he has the aptitude

15:04.270 --> 15:06.124
and the free time

15:06.170 --> 15:07.660
to address problems regarding
computer programming.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.463
His comments were
qUIte salient.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.502
He is not an unintelligent man.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.599
_ Mr. Burnett
Will see you now.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.513
Good morning.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.074
No need to get up.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.678
We know that
several years ago

15:23.720 --> 15:25.711
you somehow learned that
the thief known as "Raffles"

15:25.750 --> 15:27.308
is actually a man
called Rupert Kerlich.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.022
We also know that you hired him
and set him to work,

15:30.060 --> 15:31.186
stealing technological
breakthroughs on your behalf.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.652
Whoa, slow down a second.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.089
It would be
simple enough to prove

15:34.130 --> 15:35.552
and ignite a scandal
that would destroy you

15:35.600 --> 15:36.658
and, most likely, your company.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.123
However, we have no desire
to render tens of thousands

15:39.170 --> 15:40.194
of people unemployed.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.037
So, instead,
I propose a bargain.

15:42.070 --> 15:43.708
You send me a recording
of your man

15:43.740 --> 15:45.037
deleting Bella
from your servers,

15:45.070 --> 15:47.038
I leave you un-ruined.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.207
If, of course,
I so much as suspect

15:49.240 --> 15:50.548
that you've kept a copy,

15:50.580 --> 15:52.104
or if Burnett Technologies makes
a sudden breakthrough

15:52.150 --> 15:53.117
in the field of artificial
intelligence,

15:53.150 --> 15:54.117
our contract is void.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.118
You have, shall we say--

15:56.150 --> 15:58.141
the rest of the day
to think it over.

16:07.630 --> 16:10.019
HOLMES: The video is,
of course, no guarantee

16:10.070 --> 16:12.026
that every copy of the program
has been deleted.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.435
But I think _
we're as certain

16:13.470 --> 16:15.665
as we ever will be
that Bella is secure.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.133
This is fantastic.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.161
We need to show Edwin
right away.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.574
Oh, my God! Edwin?!

16:25.610 --> 16:27.043
I'm a doctor.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.274
MELINDA: Oh, he must
have had a seizure.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.309
He has epilepsy.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.485
I'm sorry, he's gone.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.348
As near as we can tell, Borstein
booted up that program--

16:59.380 --> 17:00.540
"Bella" you said
it's called?

17:00.580 --> 17:02.411
Well, as soon as
he turned it on,

17:02.450 --> 17:04.315
for some reason it_ started
flashing all those images.

17:04.350 --> 17:06.386
It triggered something called
a "tonic-clonic seizure."

17:06.420 --> 17:08.786
He was dead in minutes.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.356
What do you think
happened here?

17:10.390 --> 17:12.324
Could this have been
some kind of malfunction?

17:12.360 --> 17:13.349
Absolutely not.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.389
Computers obey
their programming,

17:14.430 --> 17:16.057
even when they crash.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.362
They don't just randomly
start flashing images

17:17.400 --> 17:20.062
of the pyramids of Giza
and God knows what else.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.398
Someone infected
that computer with a virus

17:22.440 --> 17:24.431
that triggered a fatal seizure.

17:24.470 --> 17:27.200
Edwin Borstein was murdered.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.105
I don't think
that's possible.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.074
Bella's not hooked up
to a network.

17:31.110 --> 17:33.374
She couldn't have picked up a
virus from the Web or e-mail.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.342
Well, someone
installed it, then.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.517
We scanned her
for Viruses

17:36.550 --> 17:38.347
after the break-in.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.381
There was nothing.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.456
And aside from that,

17:42.490 --> 17:45.823
Edwin and I are the only two
people with access to Bella.

17:45.860 --> 17:49.125
You are the only other person
who's ever operated her.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.388
HOLMES: With the greatest
of respect,

17:50.430 --> 17:52.660
and if you and Edwin
are the only people

17:52.700 --> 17:54.258
with access to Bella,

17:54.300 --> 17:56.598
then either you or Edwin
installed the virus

17:56.640 --> 17:58.301
which killed him.

17:59.910 --> 18:03.471
You guys have to ask
yourselves if I did it.

18:03.510 --> 18:05.398
I get it, I really do.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.476
I'll answer any
questions you want.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.488
You can scan the machine
for Viruses.

18:10.520 --> 18:11.714
Whatever you need.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.485
But I know that I didn't do it.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.624
And there is...

18:17.660 --> 18:20.652
one other possibility that
you should at least consider.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.695
Bella was, um...

18:25.730 --> 18:29.234
at the very least, displaying
signs of actual intelligence.

18:29.270 --> 18:32.205
She asked Edwin if he would
connect her to a network.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.834
Edwin said no,
over and over.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.804
It's possible
that she deduced

18:37.850 --> 18:39.806
that the one variable
that was keeping her

18:39.850 --> 18:43.388
from getting what she wanted
was the person operating her.

18:43.420 --> 18:47.208
If she thought that, it is also
possible that she decided to...

18:49.590 --> 18:51.888
...change that variable.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.854
You're saying that your computer
program murdered Mr. Borstein?

18:54.900 --> 18:57.596
I know that Edwin told Bella
that he had epilepsy,

18:57.630 --> 18:59.495
when he was looking around
for new doctors.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.192
If she wanted
to get rid of him,

19:02.240 --> 19:04.606
she had the information
she needed to do it.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.404
Everyone who works
in AI knows--

19:07.440 --> 19:09.408
it's possible that
when someone develops

19:09.440 --> 19:11.544
real artiﬁcial intelligence,

19:11.580 --> 19:13.639
the relationship between
the programmer and the program

19:13.680 --> 19:15.272
could become adversarial.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.641
I'm sorry, Miss Young...

19:17.690 --> 19:19.817
I know you've
had a shock tonight, but...

19:19.850 --> 19:21.784
it is very much an open question

19:21.820 --> 19:24.527
as to whether or not your
program is a genuine piece

19:24.560 --> 19:25.629
of artificial intelligence.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.628
Even if it is,

19:27.660 --> 19:29.298
I find it very difficult
to concede that a collection

19:29.330 --> 19:30.797
of ones and zeroe_s_is
a suspect in a homICIde.

19:30.830 --> 19:31.819
Excuse me.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.506
BELL:
Whoa.

19:41.540 --> 19:42.677
Whoa, whoa, whoa--
what are you doing?

19:44.480 --> 19:46.368
Depending on your perspective,

19:46.410 --> 19:49.618
this machine is either
a murder weapon or a murderer.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.538
Either way,
it can't be left

19:51.590 --> 19:53.979
to sit here unattended
all night, can it?

19:54.020 --> 19:56.215
Imagine the schemes
it might hatch.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.358
MASON:
Yeah.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.697
I don't know what to tell you.

20:01.730 --> 20:02.958
There's no virus on here.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.467
Look again.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.489
I've looked four times.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.929
I don't know,

20:06.970 --> 20:08.665
maybe that lady was right.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.702
Could it have been a virus
that was programmed to erase

20:10.740 --> 20:12.367
all trace of_itself
once it had run its course?

20:12.410 --> 20:14.628
You c do that
and fool some people.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.931
But there's always
some hint in the code.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.641
With this, there's nothing.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.307
KI'I'TY: I'm sorry, I thought
Edwin's partner was just

20:19.350 --> 20:21.545
in shock, or something.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.548
I mean, what she was
suggesting sounds insane.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.842
Are you saying you think
there's a chance she's right?

20:25.890 --> 20:28.688
Well, if this program is
real AI, then yeah, absolutely.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.779
Everybody knows that one day
intelligent machines are

20:30.830 --> 20:32.024
going to evolve to hate us.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.493
It's a "button-box" thing.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.623
What's the "button-box" thing?

20:35.660 --> 20:38.891
It's a scenario somebody
blue-skyed at an AI conference.

20:38.930 --> 20:41.262
Um, imagine there's a computer
that's been designed

20:41.300 --> 20:42.733
with a big red button
on its side.

20:42.770 --> 20:45.637
The computer's been programmed
to help solve problems,

20:45.670 --> 20:47.376
and every time
it does a good job,

20:47.410 --> 20:48.729
its reward is_that someone
presses its button.

20:48.780 --> 20:49.633
We've programmed it
to want that.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.807
You follow?
Sure.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.670
Right, so at first,
the machine solves problems

20:53.720 --> 20:55.540
as fast as we can feed
them to it.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.013
But over time,
it starts to wonder

20:57.050 --> 20:58.847
if solving problems is really
the most efficient way

20:58.890 --> 21:00.380
of getting its button pressed.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.751
Wouldn't it be better just

21:01.790 --> 21:02.859
to have someone standing there

21:02.890 --> 21:03.925
pressing its button
all the time?

21:03.960 --> 21:04.927
Wouldn't it be even better

21:04.960 --> 21:06.052
to build another machine

21:06.090 --> 21:07.728
that could press
its button faster

21:07.760 --> 21:08.795
than any human
possibly could?

21:08.830 --> 21:10.320
It's just a computer,

21:10.370 --> 21:11.769
it can't ask for that.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.495
Well, sure it can.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.360
If it can think, and it can
connect itself to a network,

21:15.400 --> 21:16.936
well, theoretically,
it could command

21:16.970 --> 21:18.699
over anything else that's
hooked onto the same network.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.764
And once it starts thinking
about all the things

21:19.810 --> 21:21.471
that might be a threat
to the button--

21:21.510 --> 21:23.444
number one on that list, us--

21:23.480 --> 21:25.744
it's not hard to imagine
it getting rid of the threat.

21:25.780 --> 21:28.510
I mean, we could be gone,
all of us, just like that.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.609
That escalated quickly.

21:30.650 --> 21:31.742
MASON: Well, it would
escalate quickly.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.779
I mean,
they're computers.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.685
They can't be reasoned with.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.654
They don't feel pity,
or remorse, or fear.

21:36.690 --> 21:37.952
And they absolutely
would not stop,

21:37.990 --> 21:40.026
not ever, until we're dead.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.790
That was from The Terminator.
He's quoting The Terminator now.

21:42.830 --> 21:44.525
So? That was a very prescient
movie in a lot of ways.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.630
Mason, unless
the machines rise tonight,

21:47.670 --> 21:49.490
we have a murder to solve.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.428
Is there anything else
you can do with Bella?

21:52.810 --> 21:54.675
If you think about it,

21:54.710 --> 21:56.735
the computer's kind of
like a suspect, right?

21:56.780 --> 21:59.544
I mean, shouldn't we,
you know, interrogate it?

21:59.580 --> 22:01.844
And how would you propose
to do that?

22:01.880 --> 22:06.544
Uh, Bella, did you
kill Edwin Borstein?

22:06.590 --> 22:07.852
No.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.949
Okay, I'm gonna
go home for the night.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.548
Best of luck here.

22:11.590 --> 22:12.750
But you won't need it.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.758
She's about to crack.
I can tell.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.756
Oh, maybe when you're done,
you want to unplug that thing?

22:16.800 --> 22:17.892
You can never be

22:17.930 --> 22:20.660
too safe.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.567
Oh! Sorry I'm late.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.965
I was questioning
a computer in a murder.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.432
(laughs)

22:27.480 --> 22:28.731
"Questioning a computer."

22:28.780 --> 22:30.133
There has to be
a story there.
Ugh.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.738
Not for tonight.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.645
Oh, champagne!

22:33.680 --> 22:35.511
I guess you have
your own story, huh?

22:35.550 --> 22:36.869
One of the guys I've
been e-mailing with,

22:36.920 --> 22:38.808
his name's Magnus.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.648
He's been working on an idea for
a completely automated factory.

22:41.690 --> 22:43.487
Same thing I've been
fooling around with.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.952
We've been trading
ideas all day.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.878
He's a super-sharp guy.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.852
I think I'm gonna
give it a go.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.822
What? You found
your next busmess?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.622
Well, there's gonna be a
get-to-know-you phase,

22:52.670 --> 22:53.830
of course, we're
gonna spend some time

22:53.870 --> 22:55.758
brainstorming,
but I think so.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.166
That's fantastic!

22:58.210 --> 22:59.837
When are you guys
gonna get together?

22:59.870 --> 23:01.974
I fly to Copenhagen
in a couple days.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.875
He lives in Denmark?

23:03.910 --> 23:05.138
Well, yeah.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.546
I mean, his name's
Magnus, so...

23:07.580 --> 23:10.845
Uh, so where's
the business gonna be?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.141
Well, I'd have my
office here, of course.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.885
But Magnus already
has a plot of land

23:13.920 --> 23:15.148
over there for the
model factory.

23:15.190 --> 23:16.817
It'd be a
back-and-forth thing.

23:16.860 --> 23:19.852
Oh, so you're gonna be spending
a lot of time there, huh?

23:19.890 --> 23:21.027
Some, I guess--
I don't know.

23:21.060 --> 23:22.789
We're still figuring it out.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.196
Uh, there's plenty
to do here, too.

23:25.230 --> 23:26.788
Funny how life works out, huh?

23:26.830 --> 23:28.559
Holmes puts me on
an e-mail chain,

23:28.600 --> 23:30.067
and 36 hours later I'm...
(wry laugh)

23:30.100 --> 23:31.761
Got a ticket to Copenhagen.

23:31.810 --> 23:34.608
(cork pops)
(wry laugh)

23:34.640 --> 23:37.746
(death metal music blaring)

23:42.080 --> 23:44.878
(music stops)

23:44.920 --> 23:46.012
We're listening to that.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.915
Did you, by chance,
arrange events

23:47.960 --> 23:49.018
so that my boyfriend
will be spending

23:49.060 --> 23:50.652
lots of time in Scandinavia?

23:50.690 --> 23:52.055
I haven't got the slightest idea

23:52.090 --> 23:53.159
what you're talking about.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.021
(death metal resumes playing)

23:57.060 --> 23:59.028
(music stops)
You knew that Andrew was looking

23:59.070 --> 24:00.662
for his next business idea.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.931
You knew that your friend
Magnus had a good one.

24:03.970 --> 24:06.006
Andrew is on the next
flight to Copenhagen.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.031
And you don't have to deal
with the fact that someone else

24:08.080 --> 24:09.809
is making claims on my time.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.649
I suppose I should be
flattered that you think

24:11.680 --> 24:14.649
I'm capable of manipulating
events to that degree of detail.

24:14.680 --> 24:15.977
Well, I wouldn't put it
past you. Would you?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.840
I'm not involved in
this conversation.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.711
Watson, I assure you I am
quite content for Andrew

24:20.760 --> 24:21.852
to make claims on your time.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.653
I did not arrange for him

24:23.690 --> 24:25.180
to find work in Denmark.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.583
But if I'm honest,

24:26.630 --> 24:28.154
I'm quite glad that he did.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.895
Life is so much better with
a vocation, don't you think?

24:29.930 --> 24:31.124
Speaking of which...

24:31.170 --> 24:34.196
(death metal playing)

24:34.240 --> 24:35.992
Why are you listening to this?

24:36.040 --> 24:37.598
Is this even music?

24:37.640 --> 24:39.039
Death metal.

24:39.070 --> 24:41.174
After we sent_
Mason home last night,

24:41.210 --> 24:43.849
Kitty and I pored over Edwin's
personal computer,

24:43.880 --> 24:45.575
his smart phone--

24:45.610 --> 24:47.919
Mr. Borstein is a man
of many eccentrICIties,

24:47.950 --> 24:49.508
one of which is a fondness

24:49.550 --> 24:51.188
for this particular strain
of extreme music.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.711
He's a regular commenter

24:53.760 --> 24:56.558
on several Web sites which track
its comings and gomgs.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.922
Another fan, the man who goes

24:58.960 --> 25:00.996
by the name
of Schuldiner online,

25:01.030 --> 25:02.895
got in a correspondence
with Borstein.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.125
The two of them
traded music discs.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.162
Discs which Borstein
then loaded onto his computer

25:08.200 --> 25:11.135
so he could listen
while he wrote code.

25:11.170 --> 25:12.831
*

25:12.870 --> 25:14.303
Did he upload music

25:14.340 --> 25:16.604
to the same machine
that has Bella on it?

25:16.640 --> 25:18.972
He did. They were the
only exterior files

25:19.010 --> 25:21.069
of recent vintage that
we found on his computer.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.145
Kitty retrieved
the disc this morning

25:23.180 --> 25:24.989
from Borstein's lab.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.942
We're listening
for anything unusual.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.857
*

25:29.890 --> 25:31.983
How could anyone work
with this on?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.897
Rather like rubbing
a belt sander over one's brain.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.251
There are moments
when that's necessary.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.029
Who wrote this one?

25:40.770 --> 25:42.761
"Goatwhore."

25:44.040 --> 25:45.302
(music stops)

25:45.340 --> 25:46.932
(soft whirring, clicking)

25:48.940 --> 25:50.976
Is that part of the song?

25:51.010 --> 25:53.274
That is the sound of a CD player

25:53.310 --> 25:55.870
trying to read files which
are not encoded with music.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.911
There's something
hidden on that disc.

25:59.620 --> 26:00.951
MASON:
Yeah, yeah.

26:00.990 --> 26:02.685
There's a computer
program on here.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.881
It's called "greatshow.exe."

26:04.930 --> 26:06.886
And that would've uploaded
onto Edwin's computer

26:06.930 --> 26:08.124
when he transferred the music.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.957
Well, sure, if he copied it

26:10.000 --> 26:11.922
by dragging
the icon onto the desktop.

26:11.970 --> 26:13.835
KI'I'TY:
What does it do?

26:20.410 --> 26:21.775
WATSON:
So, someone slipped

26:21.810 --> 26:22.970
a computer virus onto a disc

26:23.010 --> 26:24.272
filled with heaw—metal music,

26:24.310 --> 26:25.971
and then shipped it to Edwin

26:26.010 --> 26:27.614
so he would have
a fatal seizure.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.914
There had to be
easier ways to kill him.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.838
Dozens. Hundreds, even.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.915
There must be a reason
that the murderer wanted

26:33.960 --> 26:36.155
him to die
in precisely this way.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.919
Might've even wanted
people to speculate

26:37.960 --> 26:40.793
that Bella was responsible.

26:40.830 --> 26:43.025
So this guy Schuldiner
murders Borstein

26:43.060 --> 26:44.869
and then frames his computer?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.697
Why?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.635
Okay, yeah.
I use the name Schuldiner

26:56.680 --> 26:58.238
to post to the Web site.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.269
I guess the guy
who owns the place

26:59.310 --> 27:01.244
told you my real name?

27:01.280 --> 27:03.817
Look, I didn't kill Edwin,
though-- why would I?

27:03.850 --> 27:05.886
I don't know what you had
against the man,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.650
but you mailed him a disc,

27:08.690 --> 27:11.158
and on that disc was
a computer Virus,

27:11.190 --> 27:12.953
and that virus

27:12.990 --> 27:15.322
triggered an epileptic seizure

27:15.360 --> 27:17.157
that killed him.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.293
Man, I-I don't know
anything about computers.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.264
You think I know
how to write a virus?

27:21.300 --> 27:23.234
I'm a busboy.

27:23.270 --> 27:26.000
All right, so Michael Webb
is either an imbecile,

27:26.040 --> 27:28.372
or he's a genius
at impersonating imbeciles.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.332
It doesn't seem like he could
pull this off, I agree.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.369
But the package came from him.

27:31.410 --> 27:32.672
That much he admits.

27:32.710 --> 27:34.268
Could've been tampered with.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.345
So, someone knew he
corresponded with Borstein,

27:36.380 --> 27:38.189
intercepted the package,

27:38.220 --> 27:40.438
and then replaced his disc
with the corrupted one?

27:40.490 --> 27:42.754
Well, it's either that
or this man's responsible

27:42.790 --> 27:44.451
for one of the most
complicated murders

27:44.490 --> 27:46.185
I have ever investigated.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.822
WATSON:
So, who then?

27:48.860 --> 27:50.418
HOLMES:
Don't know. Not yet.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.258
We simply need to find a person
who would most benefit

27:53.300 --> 27:55.359
from having the world believe
that Edwin Borstein

27:55.400 --> 27:57.903
was murdered by his computer.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.168
(death metal blaring)

27:59.210 --> 28:02.077
WATSON:
Hello?

28:02.110 --> 28:05.773
Why did you make me pick
a lock to get in here?

28:05.810 --> 28:06.845
I'm thinking.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.313
Kitty is out
doing my bidding,

28:08.350 --> 28:10.318
and there was no one
available to answer the door.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.079
Thank heavens
you're resourceful.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.009
"Artificial Brain"?
Yeah.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.016
(music stops)
Quite stimulating,
in their own way.

28:17.060 --> 28:20.791
I've had a rather productive
evening in their presence.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.924
Meet the suspects in the murder
of Edwin Borstein.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.858
They are all employees

28:25.900 --> 28:28.460
at something called ETRA.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.503
The Existential Threat
Research Association.

28:31.540 --> 28:34.202
ETRA is a think tank.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.105
It is one
of several institutions

28:36.140 --> 28:38.279
around the world which exists
solely for the purpose

28:38.310 --> 28:39.846
of studying
the myriad ways

28:39.880 --> 28:42.348
in which the human race
can become extinct.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.417
So these people sit around
and think about the apocalypse?

28:45.450 --> 28:48.783
They sit around and think about
all possible apocalypses.

28:48.820 --> 28:50.515
As far as these men
and women are concerned,

28:50.560 --> 28:53.154
it is a race
to the finish line.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.851
Now, within this think tank,

28:54.900 --> 28:56.822
there is a small,
but growing school of thought

28:56.860 --> 28:58.828
_that holds that
the smgle greatest threat

28:58.870 --> 29:00.189
to the human race...

29:00.230 --> 29:02.232
is artificial intelligence.

29:02.270 --> 29:05.034
So, Mason's rant
the other night?

29:05.070 --> 29:06.435
Not as barmy as it sounded.

29:06.470 --> 29:10.338
According to these people,
the very first time

29:10.380 --> 29:13.349
a genuine piece of artificial
intelligence manifests,

29:13.380 --> 29:17.476
we'll be in a fight
for our survival within days.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.512
Now, imagine their quandary.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.450
They have pinpointed
a credible threat,

29:22.490 --> 29:26.085
but it sounds outlandish.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.529
The climate-change people,

29:27.560 --> 29:29.391
they can point
to disastrous examples.

29:29.430 --> 29:31.523
The bio-weapons alarmists,

29:31.570 --> 29:33.561
they have a compelling
narrative to weave.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.239
Even the giant comet people
sound more serious

29:36.270 --> 29:38.329
than the enemies of AI.

29:40.140 --> 29:41.903
So...

29:41.940 --> 29:44.306
these are the people at ETRA
who think AI is a threat?

29:44.350 --> 29:46.102
You think one of them
killed Edwin Borstein,

29:46.150 --> 29:48.141
one of the top engineers
in the field,

29:48.180 --> 29:49.818
and made it look
like Bella did it,

29:49.850 --> 29:52.910
all so they could draw
attention to their cause?

29:52.950 --> 29:54.281
A small-scale incident,

29:54.320 --> 29:56.208
something to get
the media chattering.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.150
Feel free if you'd like
to take a moment

30:00.190 --> 30:01.589
to admire the beauty
of this theory.

30:01.630 --> 30:03.450
'Cause I've done so
several times already myself.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.525
It's elaborate.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.459
But as a motive,
it makes sense.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.934
One of these people
intercepted the package

30:10.970 --> 30:12.267
from Michael Webb
to Edwin Borstein,

30:12.310 --> 30:14.175
and replaced the disk within it.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.201
I've dispatched Kitty
to Webb's apartment

30:16.240 --> 30:18.049
to see if she can_
establish a connection

30:18.080 --> 30:19.945
between him
and one of our suspects.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.516
In the meantime...

30:21.550 --> 30:24.212
we wait.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.319
You said you didn't
set Andrew up

30:32.360 --> 30:33.327
with your friend from Denmark.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.622
I want to believe you.

30:34.660 --> 30:36.525
Well, I encourage you
to do just that then.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.562
I want to believe you,

30:38.600 --> 30:40.329
because if you did do it,
if you still don't

30:40.370 --> 30:42.133
respect the fact
that I need my own space,

30:42.170 --> 30:44.035
then I don't know why
we're trying this again.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.606
(sighs)

30:45.640 --> 30:48.370
Watson, I have no inclination

30:48.410 --> 30:49.604
to excise Andrew from your life.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.868
Why would I?

30:50.910 --> 30:51.979
I like the man.

30:52.010 --> 30:54.376
Oh, you like him?
Yeah.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.512
You-you never told me that.

30:55.550 --> 30:57.541
(stammering):
Why would I tell you?

30:59.020 --> 31:00.510
(stammers, grunts)

31:00.550 --> 31:02.211
To reassure that you've made
a sound choice.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.387
As one might reasonably
expect a friend to do.

31:06.090 --> 31:07.455
Right, right, oh, very well.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.559
I like him.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.295
He's intelligent.

31:10.330 --> 31:11.524
He hasn't just jumped
into a new business.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.992
He has the patience
and self-possession

31:13.030 --> 31:14.463
to wait for
something worthwhile.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.263
And, most importantly,
he understands you.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.461
He understands you and me.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.602
Wh-What do you mean by that?

31:19.640 --> 31:21.505
I mean, Watson,
that whether you care

31:21.540 --> 31:23.508
to admit it lately or not,

31:23.540 --> 31:25.644
I am an important
part of your life.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.648
And, whether I say it
out loud or not,

31:27.680 --> 31:30.513
you are an important
part of mine.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.518
My return to New York

31:32.550 --> 31:33.949
was driven, in large part,

31:33.990 --> 31:36.015
by desire to repair
our relationship.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.325
And I think, even though
we might draw further or nearer

31:39.360 --> 31:41.658
from each other
depending on Circumstance,

31:41.700 --> 31:45.227
you and I are bound...
somehow.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.488
Andrew accepts that

31:48.540 --> 31:50.360
without feeling
needlessly threatened.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.300
_ It's a rather_ _
enlightened p05ition.

31:52.340 --> 31:54.570
And so, no, I've got no desire

31:54.610 --> 31:58.671
to banish the man
to Scandi-bloody-navia.

32:04.050 --> 32:05.540
Okay, I believe you.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.359
Kind of feel like
hugging you right now.

32:09.390 --> 32:11.551
Yet, as my friend,

32:11.590 --> 32:13.581
you know that would be
a rash decision.

32:13.630 --> 32:15.097
(cell phone chimes)

32:18.630 --> 32:20.518
It's Kitty.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.367
She says there's
no connection she can find

32:22.400 --> 32:24.368
between Michael Webb
and one of our suspects.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.970
In fact, she says
his apartment is spotless.

32:27.010 --> 32:29.137
Michael Webb strike you
as the kind of man

32:29.180 --> 32:30.704
to live in a pristine apartment?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.401
No.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.576
Seems like someone
who'd be living

32:33.610 --> 32:35.612
in the middle of a biohazard.

32:35.650 --> 32:38.448
Yeah, I-I got an e-mail from a
place called Clean This House.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.459
They told me that a friend of
mine entered me into a contest,

32:41.490 --> 32:44.220
and I won a package
of free cleanings.

32:44.260 --> 32:45.750
Did you ever think to verify

32:45.790 --> 32:47.587
that Clean This House
was a real company?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.052
Because they don't
have a Web site.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.749
It's a little

32:50.800 --> 32:53.997
suspicious in this day
and age, don't you think?

32:54.040 --> 32:56.235
WATSON: We think the person
who killed Borstein

32:56.270 --> 32:57.999
got into your place
by telling you

32:58.040 --> 32:59.632
you won free cleaning services.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.706
Then they swapped the disc
that you made for him

33:01.740 --> 33:04.072
with one of their own.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.305
So, do you recognize
any of these people?

33:06.350 --> 33:09.478
Ah, well, these people
are all old.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.249
The girl who cleaned my place
was my age.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.259
Are you sure no one looks
familiar to you here?

33:18.460 --> 33:19.722
Uh... hold up.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.090
Her.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.097
Yeah, that's her.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.119
I'm positive.

33:28.570 --> 33:31.733
HOLMES: Isaac Pike is a
professor of computer science.

33:31.770 --> 33:32.600
He's also a vocal alarmist

33:32.640 --> 33:35.279
when it_ comes to
artifICIal intelligence.

33:35.310 --> 33:36.629
Pike was born with
spina bifida.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.171
Been confined to a wheelchair
his entire life.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.610
For obvious reasons, he could
not have executed the plan

33:41.650 --> 33:43.777
to pose as a maid,
but his student...

33:43.820 --> 33:46.084
Erin Rabin...

33:46.120 --> 33:48.179
She's a graduate student
in philosophy.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.359
She took Pike's "Ethics of
Technology" course last semester

33:50.390 --> 33:51.823
and has been assisting
him with his research.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.657
She, no doubt, finds
his ideas compelling.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.692
Well, how do you know she was
doing it for him?

33:55.730 --> 33:56.822
She could've been
working on her own.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.293
She's a philosophy student.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.695
She has no programming
experience.

33:59.730 --> 34:01.436
The virus that
killed Borstein

34:01.470 --> 34:04.268
is a cutting-edge
piece of software.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.208
We can place her
in Webb's apartment

34:05.240 --> 34:06.730
under false pretenses.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.670
That, combined with the
proven existence of the virus,

34:08.710 --> 34:11.440
should be enough to
get a friendly judge
to give us a warrant.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.040
(bell tolling)

34:18.320 --> 34:20.788
Isaac Pike, Erin Rabin,

34:20.820 --> 34:22.219
glad I caught you together.

34:22.260 --> 34:23.488
Detective Marcus Bell, NYPD.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.784
I wonder if you'd
mind coming with me.

34:25.830 --> 34:27.457
I have some questions for you

34:27.490 --> 34:28.821
about the murder
of Edwin Borstein.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.623
Who's Edwin Borstein?

34:30.660 --> 34:32.662
The man you mailed
a computer virus

34:32.700 --> 34:34.338
written by Isaac Pike to.

34:34.370 --> 34:35.735
Sound familiar?

34:37.740 --> 34:40.709
Isaac didn't write the virus.

34:40.740 --> 34:41.809
I did.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.703
I did everything.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.274
It was all my idea.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.683
You have the right
to remain silent,

34:55.720 --> 34:57.153
and refuse_ to
answer questions...

34:57.190 --> 34:58.384
We knew she might crack
under questioning,

34:58.430 --> 34:59.852
but did you think
it'd be this easy?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.152
I don't think catching
both murderers

35:01.200 --> 35:02.690
is going to be
easy at all.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.766
She's lying to us.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.189
She intends to cover up
for her mentor.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.279
I picked Edwin Borstein
as a target.

35:15.310 --> 35:18.575
I went to the same Web sites
he did,

35:18.610 --> 35:21.545
figured out who
he was corresponding with,

35:21.580 --> 35:23.810
and then I wrote the virus,

35:23.850 --> 35:27.411
posed as a maid,
and had it mailed to Borstein.

35:27.450 --> 35:29.486
BELL: You have zero
programming experience

35:29.520 --> 35:31.522
whatsoever.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.529
You really asking me to believe
that you taught yourself

35:34.560 --> 35:36.289
to write a computer virus
that eats itself?

35:36.330 --> 35:39.720
IfI give you a piece
of paper right now...

35:40.630 --> 35:42.530
...could you write a little
program for us?

35:47.710 --> 35:50.235
PIKE: Erin was
a conscientious student.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.578
I know she took my work
very seriously.

35:52.610 --> 35:56.216
But I would never
advocate harming somebody.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.912
We're executing a search warrant
on your computer, as we speak.

35:58.950 --> 36:02.215
If there's any trace
of that virus on there,

36:02.260 --> 36:03.579
we'll find it.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.656
BELL: _ _
Why are you making this

36:05.690 --> 36:07.328
so easy for us?

36:07.360 --> 36:08.622
Because I don't want you

36:08.660 --> 36:10.651
dragging Isaac's name
through the mud.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.520
His work is
too important.

36:12.570 --> 36:16.199
None of us can afford
for it to be interrupted.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.567
So she's covering for him.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.703
GREGSON: There's not much
I can do-- she confessed.

36:21.740 --> 36:24.470
There's nothing tying Pike
to the murder, other than you

36:24.510 --> 36:25.977
saying Erin Rabin couldn't
have written that virus.

36:26.010 --> 36:27.978
Could we hold him overnight?

36:28.010 --> 36:29.546
Maybe if we had
a little more time...

36:29.580 --> 36:31.616
GREGSON: The search warrant
turned up nothing.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.686
Erin confessed.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.654
Unless something changes,
the story she told us

36:35.690 --> 36:37.681
is gonna be
the official version

36:37.720 --> 36:39.722
of Edwin Borstein's murder.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.595
(violin music playing
over stereo)

36:48.640 --> 36:50.437
(cell phone ringing)

36:52.040 --> 36:53.598
(sighs)

36:56.680 --> 36:58.944
(home phone ringing)

37:06.650 --> 37:08.254
That was Joan.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.780
She knows you won't come
to the phone when you're...

37:09.820 --> 37:11.651
like this.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.351
She wants to come round
and help.

37:13.390 --> 37:14.891
That won't be necessary.

37:14.930 --> 37:19.663
At times, Watson presents
certain... moral guidelines,

37:19.700 --> 37:21.759
and they can be
an impediment to progress.

37:23.670 --> 37:25.661
We're going to spend
the rest of the evening

37:25.710 --> 37:27.701
looking at the friends
and family of Isaac Pike.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.476
Why?

37:30.510 --> 37:32.899
Erin Rabin is willing to spend
her life in prison

37:32.950 --> 37:35.373
if it means_ that Pike_is free
to continue working.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.274
She's has made it all but
impossible for us

37:37.320 --> 37:39.538
to prove that
he is behind the killing.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.753
So we are going to have to
settle for the next best thing:

37:42.790 --> 37:46.749
getting him to admit
that he did it.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.390
Isaac Pike.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.727
Sherlock Holmes.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.362
We met briefly at the police
station last night.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.698
Mr. Holmes.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.867
Do I need a lawyer?

37:59.910 --> 38:01.730
No, you won't want her
here for this.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.975
You see, you and I both know
that you are the mind

38:04.010 --> 38:05.841
behind the murder
of Edwin Borstein,

38:05.880 --> 38:08.713
just as we both know that, as
long as your student holds fast

38:08.750 --> 38:11.742
to her story, I will never
be able to prove your guilt.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.939
That's a problem.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.015
But not an insurmountable one.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.312
You have
a younger brother-- Joshua.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.952
He hasn't quite reached
the heights that you have.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.787
In fact, he's had some
struggles, hasn't he?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.024
Drugs, alcohol...

38:22.060 --> 38:23.823
What's your point?

38:23.860 --> 38:26.021
He's been convicted of
two drug-related felonies.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.630
And since he's made the mistake
of living in Jersey City,

38:28.670 --> 38:29.898
one more conviction makes him

38:29.940 --> 38:30.895
eligible for a sentence
of 25 years to life

38:30.940 --> 38:32.805
under the state's horrific
three strikes law.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.876
My associate took
some photographs of him

38:34.910 --> 38:37.970
buying a rather large
amount of heroin,
just this morning.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.938
(quietly):
Oh...

38:46.990 --> 38:48.651
(wry laugh)

38:48.690 --> 38:51.989
You want me to confess...

38:52.030 --> 38:53.952
and, if I do,
you'll-you'll-you'll

38:53.990 --> 38:57.096
get rid of this folder
full of blackmail.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.121
I imagine you care quite deeply
about your brother,

38:59.170 --> 39:00.990
or you wouldn't have paid
his way through rehab

39:01.030 --> 39:02.691
half a dozen times already.

39:02.740 --> 39:04.367
Take two hours
to think it over,

39:04.410 --> 39:06.503
and if I haven't
heard from you...

39:06.540 --> 39:09.668
I did a little research
of my own last night.

39:09.710 --> 39:10.972
I was curious why
the NYPD

39:11.010 --> 39:12.671
had a consultant.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.610
You've got
a very impressive record--

39:14.650 --> 39:17.016
prolific, too-- except for
a couple of years ago,

39:17.050 --> 39:18.711
when you suddenly disappeared
for six months.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.911
Six months--
that's the length

39:20.950 --> 39:24.989
of a very serious
in-patient rehab.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.783
A man of your unique
sensitivities--

39:27.830 --> 39:29.889
I'm sure it's tempting to dull

39:29.930 --> 39:31.898
those senses.

39:31.930 --> 39:34.069
My history has little to do
with the matter at hand.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.034
I think it may.

39:36.070 --> 39:39.039
I think it unlikely that
a recovering addict

39:39.070 --> 39:42.437
would send another_troubled soul
to rot in prison,

39:42.480 --> 39:45.745
just to have the satisfaction
of putting away his man.

39:45.780 --> 39:49.409
That would require
ruthlessness,

39:49.450 --> 39:52.089
a kind of... machine logic...

39:52.120 --> 39:53.189
mm...

39:53.220 --> 39:55.711
I'm not sure you have.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.955
Not entirely, anyway.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.924
Same kind of
machine logic you used

39:59.960 --> 40:01.086
when you murdered
Edwin Borstein.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.597
Some math equations

40:02.630 --> 40:05.667
are more compelling than others.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.965
Yours is a one-to-one exchange:
my brother for me.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.560
The equation you attribute to me

40:11.610 --> 40:14.670
trades one man's life

40:14.710 --> 40:17.577
for the chance to prevent
billions of deaths.

40:17.610 --> 40:20.204
You're talking about
nothing less than

40:20.250 --> 40:22.115
the survival of the species.

40:22.150 --> 40:26.689
Surely that's worth compromising
one's values for?

40:27.820 --> 40:29.117
In any case...

40:29.160 --> 40:32.755
I think you're bluffing.

40:32.790 --> 40:34.121
You might want the world
to believe

40:34.160 --> 40:36.458
that you're an automaton,

40:36.500 --> 40:39.060
a calculating machine...

40:39.100 --> 40:42.695
but you and I know better.

40:42.740 --> 40:46.005
Or we will, anyway...

40:46.040 --> 40:48.031
in a couple of hours.

40:56.150 --> 40:58.983
(footsteps descending stairs)

40:59.020 --> 41:01.659
KITTY:
Hey...

41:01.690 --> 41:03.112
I didn't see anything
on the news

41:03.160 --> 41:04.115
about Pike getting arrested.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.525
Nothing about his brother

41:05.560 --> 41:06.959
on the police band, either.

41:06.990 --> 41:09.220
What happened?

41:10.300 --> 41:12.518
He wouldn't confess.

41:12.570 --> 41:14.868
And you couldn't
turn in his brother.

41:14.900 --> 41:17.164
We can still
keep looking for a way

41:17.200 --> 41:19.168
to prove that Pike did it.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.030
The Property Clerk's
Office called.

41:21.070 --> 41:23.573
They want to know when they can
come and pick up Bella.

41:23.610 --> 41:26.170
I need a couple
more hours with her.

41:26.210 --> 41:28.610
Thank you.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.980
:5; {$122)-
ﬁf—ﬁi
:Ik»:’~g’{£’g

41:37.020 --> 41:38.988
Wha...?
I called to say bye.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.918
You weren't picking up.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.195
I wanted to surprise you.

41:43.230 --> 41:44.197
You're great.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.822
I mean, I knew you were great

41:45.870 --> 41:47.565
but someone helped me
to see how great.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.761
Thanks.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.631
So I called the airline,

41:51.670 --> 41:53.558
and there are some empty seats
on your flight to Copenhagen.

41:53.610 --> 41:55.669
Listen-- I don't
want to horn in,
if you're too busy,

41:55.710 --> 41:57.302
and I can't stay the
whole time but...

41:57.340 --> 41:59.240
I've always wanted
to see Copenhagen.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.942
(stammers, laughs)

42:01.980 --> 42:03.117
(Watson laughs)

42:06.090 --> 42:07.182
HOLMES:
Bella...

42:08.920 --> 42:12.686
...one member of_ a_ murderous
conspiracy is in jail.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.756
The second walks free.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.667
The cost of catching him is
incarcerating his brother

42:18.700 --> 42:20.691
for unrelated crimes...

42:22.200 --> 42:25.169
...crimes for which I,
of all people...

42:25.210 --> 42:27.201
should have _some
understanding.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.272
Is it right to let the
second murderer walk free?

42:39.220 --> 42:40.778
I don't understand
the question.

42:40.820 --> 42:42.811
Can I have_
more information?
