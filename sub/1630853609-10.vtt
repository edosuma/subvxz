WEBVTT

00:24.024 --> 00:25.901
- What terminal?
- Four.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.822
International. Nice. Where you off to?

00:31.615 --> 00:32.616
Corsica.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.786
It's an island in the Mediterranean.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.913
Wow, that sounds nice. You ever been?

00:37.996 --> 00:40.415
No. I haven't traveled in a while.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.417
My last vacation was in Fresno.

00:42.501 --> 00:45.003
I went to
a police brutality protest there.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.298
And a garlic festival.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.760
Wow. Sounds like a hell of a trip.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.438
These homeless tents
are just everywhere now.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.277
Yeah. We could be doing better
for our unhoused population.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.779
You ask me,
we should just call a bulldozer

01:10.863 --> 01:12.114
and sweep 'em all up.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.575
Well, that's not really a solution.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.326
We can't criminalize poverty.

01:16.869 --> 01:19.329
I don't really see any other way
of fixing this.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.623
There are ways to help. Structural change.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.542
There's a lot of work being put into--

01:23.625 --> 01:26.628
Yeah, I heard all that shit.
That shit doesn't really work.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.840
I think those people need to
get off their asses and get a job.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.885
- Okay. Pull over.
- What?

01:33.468 --> 01:36.305
I have a lifelong policy
that if someone says "those people,"

01:36.388 --> 01:38.307
I end the conversation. So, thank you.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.808
You have a nice day.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.519
You just gonna get out here,
in the middle of…

02:23.060 --> 02:26.021
Welcome to Corsica, everyone!

02:26.104 --> 02:27.689
I missed you guys.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.525
Isn't it gorgeous here?

02:29.608 --> 02:34.530
They have horseback riding, scuba diving,
the most beautiful beaches.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.614
Although, I did check,

02:35.697 --> 02:38.325
there are no nude beaches,
unfortunately, Rhonda.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.952
You did bring your bathing suit, right?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.996
Oh, yes, of course, dear.
It's flesh-colored.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.791
- She's lying. She didn't pack one.
- I didn't.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.085
All right.
Everyone, keep an eye on Rhonda, please.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.504
Now, enjoy some mirto.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.257
It's a Corsican liqueur made from berries.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.050
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, yeah.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.179
I just want to say again
how sorry I am for missing your play.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.765
Don't worry about it. It's stupid.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.183
It was terrible.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.602
I don't even know
why I got three curtain calls.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.271
You're not mad, are you? You promise?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.108
How can I ever be mad at you?
You're you, you know.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.778
You're my boss, my mom,
my American Girl doll,

03:14.862 --> 03:15.863
all wrapped up into one.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.448
We have a very healthy relationship.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.493
I'm so glad. Cheers.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.287
Yeah.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.790
I'm gonna go and claim my room,
just flip on some Anderson Cooper,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.792
sit there in the dark
and watch it for 45 minutes.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.460
You know, just get over the jet lag.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.089
- It's pretty cool here, huh?
- It's something.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.216
What time is the run-through
for the water presentation?

03:36.300 --> 03:40.721
- I just have a few concerns about--
- Sofia. Come on!

03:40.804 --> 03:43.182
You have got to relax.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.185
You're on island time now, man.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.437
That was Jamaican, wasn't it?
Wrong country.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.565
Yes. If we're being problematic, you
should probably get your geography right.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.484
- Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
- Okay, it's okay. Cheers.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.413
This is wonderful.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.791
Great atmosphere, great company,
great food and drinks.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.337
Y'all know what this "proscuttio"
tastes like?

04:13.921 --> 04:14.755
Freedom.

04:15.631 --> 04:19.051
Cheers to Howard
for finally being free of Tanya.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.761
I know she took the tires
off your Corolla,

04:20.844 --> 04:22.304
but breakups can be messy.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.265
All good.
Walking more, better for my heart health.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.477
You know, while we're on the subject,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.146
I actually ended things with Chelsea too.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.856
- What-- Why?
- Why would you do that?

04:34.399 --> 04:36.652
I don't know. Similar reasons.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.487
For freedom.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.821
No, that does not apply to you.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.448
Yeah, we're talking about Chelsea here.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.658
She's smart and cool,

04:42.741 --> 04:45.994
and you are the living embodiment
of an Olive Garden breadstick.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.080
- What happened?
- Well, nothing, really.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.666
There just, you know,
wasn't a love connection.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.044
You know, we weren't simpatico.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.047
Not the right puzzle pieces. You know?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
No "Yahtzee."

05:00.968 --> 05:03.679
You are low-key
the weirdest dude I've ever met.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.098
Yeah, you're being so vague
and withholding right now,

05:06.181 --> 05:07.641
I'm, like, 5% attracted to you.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.059
You know what I think?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.020
I think we're wasting time
just sitting around here gabbing.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.232
There is a whole beautiful island
out there waiting to be discovered.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.276
Carpe diem! Am I right, fellas?

05:17.359 --> 05:20.404
But… we got all these meats.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.492
Well, we should probably go after him.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.619
White people are very attracted
to waterfalls,

05:27.703 --> 05:29.371
and I don't want him to fall.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.252
Wow.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.046
This machine is actually
kind of beautiful up close.

05:38.881 --> 05:41.508
Should I be jealous
you've been spending so much time with it?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.635
No. Nothing to worry about.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.637
Hey, guys!

05:45.721 --> 05:48.515
Why don't we test the lights on Molly
for her introduction?

05:49.808 --> 05:51.894
Wow, look at that. Is that for me?

05:51.977 --> 05:53.478
Wow, I feel like a star.

05:54.104 --> 05:58.734
Okay, I was actually wondering,
what if I came from this side?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.235
Can I audition that?

06:00.319 --> 06:03.155
So, I'm walking. "Hi, how are you?"

06:03.238 --> 06:07.117
And then I say, "Welcome, everybody,
to the future of water."

06:07.201 --> 06:08.535
That feels pretty good, actually.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.870
What do you think, Sofia?

06:09.953 --> 06:11.455
Should I come
from stage left or stage right?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.208
- Both seem fine to me. Doesn't matter.
- Yeah?

06:14.291 --> 06:17.002
And I'm gonna have
a gold feature in my dress.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.754
Will that affect my lighting?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.757
God, this light is really fun.
It follows you wherever you go.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.133
I'm loving this.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.889
I should get
one of these lights in my house.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.309
For the karaoke room!
Wouldn't that be fun, Sofia?

06:33.519 --> 06:34.853
Where'd she go?

06:39.650 --> 06:41.068
Wow.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.570
Look at this place.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.989
- Isn't it spectacular?
- Yeah, I don't know.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.450
I just kind of feel like
I'm in someone's backyard right now.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.244
Is it leading us to something cool?

06:50.327 --> 06:52.871
Like a ancient temple
we can zip-line into?

06:52.955 --> 06:57.167
Guys, this is one of the most unique
botanical gardens on Earth.

06:57.251 --> 07:01.964
There are 47 species of plants
only native to Corsica.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.342
Just look at the flowers.
Look at the birds.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.888
Oh, my God. You guys, look at that one.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.890
You mean that tiny brown bird

07:11.974 --> 07:15.269
that looks like every other bird
I've ever seen in my life?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.645
Yeah.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.314
To me, it's not boring.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.817
Not at all.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.195
To me, it's perfect.

07:27.614 --> 07:28.907
Are you crying?

07:29.616 --> 07:30.576
No.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.119
No, I'm just…

07:33.453 --> 07:37.374
admiring this small creature's
simple beauty.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.130
There he goes. He flew away.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.299
Gone forever.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.510
I am so uncomfortable right now.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.930
What do we do? Do we just go home?
Do we go back to America?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.933
All right!

07:55.017 --> 07:58.103
That was cool as hell. Am I right, guys?

07:58.937 --> 08:01.690
Wow! All right.
What are we doing next, huh?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.692
What's next on the old cal-cal?

08:03.775 --> 08:06.570
Oh, my God, come on.
There's 27 more acres back here.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.114
Okay, I officially don't feel safe.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.000
Hey! I was looking for you.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.752
I wanted to run some of my speech by you.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.754
I'm sure
whatever you're going to say is fine.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.047
It seems like you got this.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.673
Okay, now I know something's up,

08:26.757 --> 08:29.301
because you're always very afraid
of what I'm going to say.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.385
What is going on?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.679
You really wanna know?

08:33.263 --> 08:36.390
- I don't think you should do this.
- What?

08:36.475 --> 08:38.602
Don't do this presentation tomorrow.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.520
Make up an excuse, pack up and go home.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.440
There's plenty of work for us there.
LA still needs our help.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.193
But this isn't helping people.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.862
It's just some weird sales pitch
to God knows who.

08:48.946 --> 08:51.323
Why are we talking about lighting
and the color of your dress?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.409
Listen, maybe this sort of thing isn't
in your comfort zone,

08:54.493 --> 08:56.328
but if you try to have a little vision--

08:56.411 --> 08:58.914
Sorry, whose vision
are we talking about, exactly?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.249
Do you think this is yours?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.751
What's that supposed to mean?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.295
When you first walked into my office,

09:05.379 --> 09:07.089
you told me you wasted 20 years

09:07.172 --> 09:09.341
getting swept up
in the life of a man you were with.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.093
Well, where I'm standing right now,

09:11.176 --> 09:13.220
it looks a lot like
that's happening again.

09:15.472 --> 09:19.560
Well, I'm sorry I tried
to find a little happiness with a guy.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.480
I'm not surprised
you're judging me though,

09:23.564 --> 09:27.985
because nothing I do
will ever be good enough in your eyes.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.530
You have never liked me,

09:31.613 --> 09:34.366
and I am always going to be
a problem for you.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.952
We should just stop pretending
that that's ever gonna change.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.871
You know what? Maybe you're right.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.206
I am. It's going to go great tomorrow,

09:41.290 --> 09:43.709
and I don't need your permission
to do anything,

09:43.792 --> 09:45.252
because it's my money!

09:46.003 --> 09:48.422
That's true.
You'll always be the one with the money.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.008
So, ultimately,
who cares what I think, right?

09:51.842 --> 09:53.343
You go on and enjoy that.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.692
Look at the three of us!
Three cowboys on the prowl.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.486
Well, we haven't even taken a step yet.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.616
You guys have probably
never even ridden a horse before, huh?

10:15.699 --> 10:17.201
Now, why would you assume that?

10:18.410 --> 10:19.786
No reason.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.915
No, I wa-- I didn't-- No, I--

10:22.998 --> 10:25.042
You know I grew up on a farm, right?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.835
I've been riding horses for a while.

10:26.919 --> 10:30.255
My family's horse was actually the only
one who ever showed me any affection.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.340
Juanita.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.592
We celebrated my eighth birthday together.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.929
The theme was "Broadway or bust."

10:37.012 --> 10:38.222
Oh, my God.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.890
Well, if that is true,

10:39.973 --> 10:43.435
then you just might be able to keep up
with this cowboy right here.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.854
I'll race you to those rocks over there.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.442
What the fuck?

10:51.610 --> 10:54.905
Is it dislocated? It feels dislocated.
Just pop it back in.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.075
- Someone give me a stick to bite down on.
- Sir, it's not dislocated.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.619
No broken bones. You'll be fine.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.871
Okay. Thank you.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.374
You okay, Arthur?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.835
Yeah, thanks. It's just--

11:08.877 --> 11:12.714
When I fell off that horse, it felt like
my whole life was flashing before my eyes.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.633
I knew I shouldn't have come.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.052
All this natural beauty

11:17.135 --> 11:21.056
just highlighting the irony
of the darkness that I feel inside of me.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.726
Arthur, what the hell is going on?
You've been weird this whole trip.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.603
You sound like a goth teenager right now.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.147
Yeah, seriously,
stop talking in Billie Eilish lyrics,

11:29.231 --> 11:30.399
and just tell us what's happening.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.234
I'm in love with Molly, okay?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.697
I'm in love with Molly,
and I don't know what to do.

11:50.002 --> 11:53.547
Hey. Where did you go?
Is everything all right?

11:54.298 --> 11:55.674
Yeah. Everything's fine.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.636
It all looks good, I just--
I need to go work on my speech.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.229
That's why I've been acting this way.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.981
That's why I broke up with Chelsea.

12:11.732 --> 12:15.235
I kept comparing her to Molly,
and it just wasn't fair to her.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.280
Oh, man. I'm sorry, Arthur.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.991
Yeah, that sounds like a lot to deal with.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.952
It's just embarrassing, you know?

12:24.036 --> 12:27.539
She's with some incredibly handsome
French billionaire

12:27.623 --> 12:29.541
who owns multiple casinos.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.669
A big part of my life is
using Bed Bath & Beyond coupons.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.797
They never expire.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.633
Look, it's not that embarrassing.

12:37.716 --> 12:41.053
You two definitely have
some type of old-people vibe going on.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.222
- I've seen it.
- Yeah, me too.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.723
Honestly, I can't believe I'm saying this,

12:44.806 --> 12:48.310
but I don't necessarily think that
Jean-Pierre is the best guy for Molly.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.687
I think he's kind of a bad influence.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.441
Are you guys saying
you think I might have a chance?

12:54.525 --> 12:58.070
I mean, I don't know about that,
but I do think that a guy like you,

12:58.153 --> 13:01.573
who's decent and kind and grounded,

13:01.657 --> 13:03.992
could be really good for Molly.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.786
Okay, that is so nice.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.871
Later, I'm gonna need you to list
my good qualities.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.166
It feels really good to talk about this.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.586
I think my cat was getting tired
of hearing about it.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.883
Well, if I can give you some advice,
as a guy who is just now living his truth,

13:19.967 --> 13:21.510
you can't keep these things bottled up.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.220
You gotta let your heart sing.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.055
Yeah. And if I can give you advice,

13:25.138 --> 13:28.433
as someone who's been bravely living
their truth since before it was cool,

13:28.517 --> 13:30.769
it's the only way
you're ever gonna feel better.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.023
Thank you, guys. That's good advice.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.733
No problem.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
Now, can we circle back

13:39.403 --> 13:42.573
and address that whole
"horse birthday party" situation?

13:42.656 --> 13:45.993
Okay, fine. But I am skipping over the
part where I had to shoot her in the head.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.037
Oh, my God in heaven.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.498
We all need so many hugs.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.254
So what we are talking about here
is not just a step forward.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.383
It's a revolution,
unlike anything ever attempted before.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.889
Now I'm honored to introduce
the wonderful, generous,

14:08.056 --> 14:11.518
beautiful Ms. Molly Wells.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.942
Thank you.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.945
Thank you so much.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.699
There's a reason we had him give
most of the presentation.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.951
Everything sounds good in that accent,
am I right?

14:29.745 --> 14:33.081
But we'd like to welcome
a very special surprise guest now

14:33.165 --> 14:35.209
to join us for the demonstration portion.

14:35.292 --> 14:39.671
Rapper, actor, multimedia superstar,

14:39.755 --> 14:41.590
GaTa! GaTa, everyone!

14:41.673 --> 14:43.091
What? Okay!

14:46.553 --> 14:47.554
What's up, Corsica?

14:47.638 --> 14:49.848
Can y'all make some more noise
for my girl Molly?

14:49.932 --> 14:50.849
Thank you.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.354
Well, I know you're performing
a song for us later today.

14:55.437 --> 14:58.565
Have you been staying hydrated,
keeping that throat ready?

14:58.649 --> 15:00.817
Actually, I could use a glass of water.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.736
Well, you're in luck.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.988
The Arroyo is about to deliver us

15:05.072 --> 15:10.369
two glasses of fresh,
clean, delicious water.

15:10.452 --> 15:15.499
And it's going to make that happen
using this.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.753
Should I pour it in, guys?

15:19.837 --> 15:23.173
- Let's do it!
- Yeah? All right.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.177
The Arroyo works within seconds!

15:27.761 --> 15:33.141
It combines a thermal drying process
with reverse osmosis purification.

15:33.225 --> 15:37.187
And not only that,
it produces electricity at the same time.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.232
All right.
You ready to see this thing in action?

15:40.315 --> 15:42.067
- I'm ready.
- Here we go.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.153
Okay. Drumroll, please.

15:52.411 --> 15:55.831
Okay. That doesn't seem right.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.543
You guys turned the machine on, right?

16:00.252 --> 16:03.714
Yeah? And it's working? Really?

16:06.425 --> 16:08.844
Well, I am being told
the color is not a problem.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.806
- It's still clean and perfectly safe.
- Clean?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.601
So, here we go. Cheers.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.645
- What is this?
- Just drink it, please.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.106
- We spent three billion on this thing.
- I don't want to.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.858
I'll double whatever we're paying you.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.110
There's no way I'm drinking this.
I don't think you should either.

16:25.194 --> 16:26.528
Okay. Great.

16:26.612 --> 16:29.573
I'll go first, solo style.

16:30.449 --> 16:33.744
And here we go. Down the hatch.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.497
The drinking is about to begin.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.750
In just a moment.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.878
With me drinking it.

16:43.795 --> 16:44.838
In my mouth.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.052
Oh, God, I don't think I can watch this.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.763
Cousin Molly, stop!
That shit's murky as hell!

16:59.311 --> 17:00.562
It's…

17:01.647 --> 17:05.901
it's not… bad.

17:06.652 --> 17:10.781
Feels like drinking directly from a river.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.619
I am so glad there's
over half a glass left to enjoy.

17:34.388 --> 17:35.430
Oh, God!

17:39.434 --> 17:41.019
And it's done!

17:41.603 --> 17:43.397
Look out, Evian.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.317
I gotta go, everyone.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.029
Fuck!

17:51.113 --> 17:55.158
A disaster at the Silver Moon
philanthropic conference earlier today.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.786
<i>The country's third-richest woman,
Molly Wells,</i>

17:57.870 --> 18:00.873
<i>was seen onstage
drinking clearly tainted water</i>

18:00.956 --> 18:02.416
<i>produced by a filtration machine</i>

18:02.499 --> 18:05.377
<i>she's poured billions of dollars
into designing.</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:09.381
<i>What a black eye for Molly Wells
and all these billionaire philanthropists.</i>

18:09.464 --> 18:12.467
-<i>She was up onstage drinking human waste!</i>
-<i>Yeah!</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:35.115
This is bad. Really bad.

18:36.742 --> 18:37.784
How are you feeling?

18:38.744 --> 18:40.662
I mean, not great.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.498
What happened out there?

18:44.082 --> 18:47.211
I don't know.
They are checking the machine.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.172
Obviously, something didn't work
as well as we thought.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.632
No shit.

18:52.758 --> 18:56.303
What are we going to do now?
We look like idiots.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.888
You and I have to go away.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.307
Go away? Where?

19:00.390 --> 19:03.185
I have a chalet in Switzerland.
It's very private.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.521
What about all the promises we made?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.524
Those people will still be there
in a few years.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.320
Do you have a better idea?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.600
Has anybody seen Molly?

19:43.684 --> 19:46.228
No, and I'm getting kinda worried.
I've looked for her everywhere,

19:46.311 --> 19:48.063
and she's not answering any of my texts.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.692
I couldn't find her anywhere either,
but I got this note sent to my room.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.659
"Dear Wells Foundation,

20:01.243 --> 20:03.287
Since the day I walked through your door,

20:03.370 --> 20:05.289
all I've done is make your lives harder.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.793
That's why I've decided to completely
step away from the foundation.

20:12.004 --> 20:15.215
You'll always have my money
to keep doing amazing, meaningful work.

20:15.299 --> 20:17.551
I'm honored to have my name on the door.

20:18.760 --> 20:19.970
Molly."

20:20.762 --> 20:22.139
She quit?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.891
That's what it sounds like to me.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.185
Damn, coz.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.770
So, what do we do now?

20:31.565 --> 20:33.066
I think we should pack up and go home.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.445
Like she said, we get back to work.
There's plenty to do, right?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.002
<i>I hope you're seated comfortably,
Ms. Wells.</i>

20:52.085 --> 20:54.880
<i>We will be departing Corsica
in approximately 15 minutes.</i>

20:54.963 --> 20:58.175
Ms. Wells, can I get you anything
before we take off?

20:58.258 --> 20:59.760
I'll just have a ginger ale, please.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.887
My stomach's
still not feeling quite right.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.149
Thank you.

21:16.693 --> 21:17.736
Sofia?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.072
I'm not opening that for you, by the way.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.326
Where's Jean-Pierre?

21:25.702 --> 21:27.120
I broke up with him.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.583
He wasn't exactly
the person I thought he was.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.922
What are you doing here?

21:41.301 --> 21:44.429
I'm here because I have
a key chain I won at Dave & Buster's

21:44.513 --> 21:47.224
because you made us all go there
after the award show.

21:47.933 --> 21:52.563
I'm here because I started using
mineral sunscreen after going to your spa.

21:53.397 --> 21:55.941
Me, Rhonda and Ainsley all use it now.

21:57.860 --> 22:01.238
I'm here because of the night
we went to Lucy's when you first started.

22:02.823 --> 22:04.533
Look, I've worked here for seven years,

22:04.616 --> 22:08.203
but that was the first night I actually
started getting to know our team,

22:08.287 --> 22:09.621
thanks to you.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.499
That was a good night.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.299
You know how big of a part of me
wants to hate you, Molly?

22:21.884 --> 22:25.637
But I can't. I like you, and we need you.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.932
You pulled us together,
and you made us better.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.103
I may know more
about this world's problems than you,

22:34.104 --> 22:35.355
but you know people.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.906
Thank you for saying that.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.868
You don't know how much that means to me.

22:50.996 --> 22:54.291
I do not accept your resignation.
We need you back.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.169
I can't do this without you.

23:01.173 --> 23:03.217
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Don't do that.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.844
Because if you cry, then I'll cry,
and we do not want that.

23:05.928 --> 23:08.388
I've had dreams
where we actually cry together,

23:08.472 --> 23:09.848
and it's really beautiful.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.391
I think if we just tried it now--

23:11.475 --> 23:13.310
- No, we're not doing that.
- Okay.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.980
But I'm glad we had this talk.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.815
Yeah.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.195
Are you sure about this?

23:23.779 --> 23:27.115
I mean, I'll never have
the moral compass you have.

23:27.199 --> 23:29.117
You're not the problem, Molly.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.663
The money is the problem.
Look at this shit.

23:33.247 --> 23:34.748
It makes people crazy.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.419
It makes them think that they're geniuses
who get to tell everyone else how to live.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.630
You don't have to be like that.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.509
- But how do we come back from this?
- I don't know.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.428
It's not an easy fix.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.603
What are you thinking about?

23:58.313 --> 24:00.440
What if we changed the story?

24:04.945 --> 24:07.030
We're calling them "intuitive shelters."

24:07.114 --> 24:08.740
They self-react to the weather.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.411
Heat themselves in the winter,
cool themselves in the summer.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.038
It's like you're living inside an app.

24:20.335 --> 24:24.381
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

24:25.257 --> 24:27.217
Wow, hi.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.928
Let's give a round of applause
for Molly Wells.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.016
Thank you.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.852
Hi.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.813
A little surprised to see you
after yesterday's…

24:39.897 --> 24:44.484
Yesterday's huge fuckup.
Let's call it what it is.

24:44.568 --> 24:46.445
It's okay. I'm fine.

24:48.572 --> 24:51.909
If you don't mind, I would like to speak
about everything else

24:51.992 --> 24:53.869
that's going on here this weekend?

24:53.952 --> 24:56.622
- Sure. The floor is yours.
- Thank you.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.210
We've heard a lot

25:01.293 --> 25:07.132
about magic water machines
and robot houses,

25:08.592 --> 25:11.678
but these aren't solutions.

25:12.638 --> 25:13.847
They're distractions.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.101
I mean, look at who's onstage right now.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.270
It's me and two other billionaires.

25:22.397 --> 25:23.398
If you think about it,

25:23.482 --> 25:28.987
we're probably the worst people
to be talking about changing the world.

25:29.821 --> 25:34.159
I mean, why would we wanna change
a system that lets us live like kings?

25:34.660 --> 25:37.788
That's why we have
these stupid conferences

25:37.871 --> 25:41.625
where all we do is talk to each other.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.963
If we actually stopped
to listen to someone

25:46.046 --> 25:48.632
who wasn't in our bubble,

25:49.883 --> 25:52.219
they'd tell us that we are the problem.

25:55.973 --> 25:58.976
Billionaires shouldn't exist.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.853
I shouldn't exist.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.441
I'm grateful
that I've gotten to know a few people

26:06.525 --> 26:10.112
who have been telling me this
for a while now.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.364
And…

26:14.074 --> 26:16.159
I think I'm finally starting to hear them.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.581
So starting today,

26:21.623 --> 26:23.917
I'm going to give away all my money.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.880
All 120 billion.

26:29.715 --> 26:33.510
Remember when I had 87 billion?
Well, it grew.

26:34.511 --> 26:40.309
Just now while I've been talking to you
I've probably made about 20 million?

26:42.186 --> 26:45.480
How fucking sick is that?

26:47.399 --> 26:51.653
Anyway, I know I'm definitely gonna
screw some things up along the way.

26:53.864 --> 26:58.368
But I promise to do my best to get to zero

26:59.453 --> 27:02.497
and to help as many people as I can.

27:03.916 --> 27:10.005
And I challenge any other ridiculously
wealthy people who are watching this

27:10.923 --> 27:12.090
to do the same.

27:15.469 --> 27:17.346
'Cause otherwise, it's not philanthropy,

27:17.429 --> 27:21.058
it's… just PR bullshit.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.562
Thank you.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.275
Yeah, coz! Tell 'em!

27:45.165 --> 27:48.710
<i>And I challenge any other
ridiculously wealthy people</i>

27:48.794 --> 27:51.004
<i>who are watching this to do the same.</i>

27:51.088 --> 27:52.798
<i>'Cause otherwise, it's not philanthropy,</i>

27:52.881 --> 27:55.217
-<i>it's just PR bullshit.</i>
- Just PR bullshit.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.468
Look at that guy's face.

27:58.971 --> 28:01.598
Holy fucking shit.
Do you know what you just did?

28:01.682 --> 28:04.309
Kind of. I think I blacked out
up there a little bit.

28:04.393 --> 28:05.561
Okay.

28:05.644 --> 28:07.187
- I don't know. Is this crazy?
- Yeah.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.355
I mean, can we really do this?

28:08.438 --> 28:11.525
No idea. All I know is
you're a complete fucking badass.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.068
Let's give it up for this queen.
She's back!

28:13.151 --> 28:15.070
Thank you.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.990
Now, listen, coz,
when you finally do get down to broke,

28:18.073 --> 28:19.491
you're welcome to crash at my place.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.118
I appreciate it, Howard.

28:21.910 --> 28:23.704
Okay, but just between inner circle here,

28:23.787 --> 28:25.664
you are gonna keep
some of the money, right?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.624
Like, 20 billion, 10 billion?

28:27.708 --> 28:30.210
Well, I think the whole point is
to give all of it away,

28:30.294 --> 28:31.295
not just some.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.213
Okay, so, one billion?

28:33.297 --> 28:36.383
You're not gonna need that money,
because from what I hear,

28:36.466 --> 28:39.595
you are a brilliant actor
with a bright future.

28:40.262 --> 28:43.724
And I am never going to miss
another performance again.

28:44.892 --> 28:45.934
I promise.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.228
Unless it's a musical.

28:48.312 --> 28:49.646
Oh, my God.
I'd never put you through that.

28:49.730 --> 28:51.023
Thank you.

28:53.358 --> 28:57.946
Okay, so I asked Ainsley to make this
to show us what our new mission is.

28:58.030 --> 29:00.282
- We get this down to zero. Y'all ready?
- Oh, yeah.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.909
Yeah!

29:01.992 --> 29:05.621
Thank you, guys, really.
From the bottom of my heart.

29:05.704 --> 29:08.457
Now, I haven't given away
all my money yet.

29:08.540 --> 29:12.294
So, tonight, it's all on me.

29:12.377 --> 29:16.048
Let's just drink this berry stuff
and fuck up Corsica.

29:17.257 --> 29:19.426
- Let's get drunk.
- Cheers to that.

29:19.510 --> 29:20.719
Yeah.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.680
Should we open a bottle of champagne?

29:23.764 --> 29:25.307
That's worse than that stuff
I drank onstage.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.892
Yeah. It turns on you quick.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.612
You ever think about
being in an animated movie?

29:38.695 --> 29:40.781
I can't just start being in movies.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.741
Well, not with that attitude, you can't.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.159
But what if it's this?

29:44.243 --> 29:47.871
You play a funny little clam in the ocean,
but you can't make a pearl,

29:47.955 --> 29:50.582
so you're like,
"Is there something wrong with me?"

29:50.666 --> 29:53.919
But there isn't.
You don't need a pearl to be beautiful.

29:54.002 --> 29:57.297
Okay, buddy, how about
we take a break from the mirto for now?

29:58.048 --> 29:58.882
Good job.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.178
- Excuse me, guys.
- Yeah.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.188
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:13.272 --> 30:14.565
How are you holding up?

30:15.440 --> 30:17.109
What do you mean? Did something happen?

30:19.278 --> 30:22.614
What you said up there was incredible.

30:23.282 --> 30:25.826
I've never seen anyone
do anything like that before.

30:26.952 --> 30:27.870
Thanks.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.998
Part of me is freaked out a little bit,

30:31.081 --> 30:34.084
because I really don't wanna move in
with Howard.

30:34.168 --> 30:35.794
Yeah.

30:35.878 --> 30:40.090
But part of me is excited.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.050
Yeah, I can see that.

30:42.134 --> 30:45.137
I mean, your life is gonna be
completely different.

30:46.138 --> 30:47.764
I think maybe that's a good thing.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.601
I've been living
at the extremes for so long,

30:50.684 --> 30:54.813
maybe it's time for a quieter,
more normal life.

30:56.356 --> 30:58.233
I think that could be really nice.

30:58.775 --> 30:59.776
Yeah.

31:04.364 --> 31:08.076
Actually, there is something that
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.247
What is it?

32:09.054 --> 32:10.514
Oh, my God.

32:12.099 --> 32:14.476
Things got pretty crazy last night,
didn't they?

32:21.525 --> 32:22.693
Yeah.

32:24.778 --> 32:27.072
Yeah. Things got really crazy.
