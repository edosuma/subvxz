WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:08.959
The Duncans are back.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.834
Mom, are you gonna keep doing that?

00:12.250 --> 00:15.000
You did that on the street,
in the driveway,

00:15.083 --> 00:16.583
last night in front of the mirror...

00:16.667 --> 00:19.375
That's because the Duncans are back.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.792
Hey, look, Toby.

00:23.125 --> 00:25.083
Our old house just like new.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.709
Toby's not gonna stay in the hotel?

00:29.041 --> 00:29.959
No.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.625
Can we talk about it?

00:34.458 --> 00:36.125
Hey, guys. What's wrong with Mrs. Dabney?

00:36.208 --> 00:37.583
She's on her porch sobbing.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.917
I don't know she started doing that
the second we drove up.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.125
Mystery solved.

00:42.834 --> 00:43.750
Where's the couch?

00:44.041 --> 00:45.500
Oh, Sweetie, don't you remember?

00:45.583 --> 00:47.583
It was broken by the bed
that fell through the ceiling,

00:47.667 --> 00:49.875
that was eaten by termites, that
daddy brought into the house.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.208
Um, the house that daddy's job pays for.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.917
So long as we're dotting the "I"s.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.667
Anyway... I already found us a new one.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.333
All you have to do is go down to
the store tomorrow and pay for it.

01:02.041 --> 01:03.709
With the money from your job.

01:04.208 --> 01:07.000
A job that brought termites into our
home and destroyed it.

01:08.417 --> 01:10.583
As long as you're dotting the
"I"s, I'm gonna cross the "T"s.

02:09.333 --> 02:11.709
Oh, it's really great. You know,
I finally made it to a baseball game.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.667
Oh, at Funway Park?

02:15.041 --> 02:16.250
It's Fenway.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.375
You know...

02:18.458 --> 02:20.834
The truth is I really don't know
much about sports.

02:20.917 --> 02:22.041
I know.

02:22.583 --> 02:25.625
I was your boyfriend.
We spent all of our time together.

02:25.709 --> 02:28.458
Oh, I thought you looked familiar.

02:33.417 --> 02:36.625
Okay. I guess Toby's done
with his breakfast.

02:36.709 --> 02:39.083
Time for a Mom hand off.
I'll be right back.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.291
Come here, littles. Yes.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.083
Hey, Mr. Duncan.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.000
Spencer. Hey.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.417
Did you happen to see me...

02:59.792 --> 03:00.792
Scratching your butt?

03:01.375 --> 03:02.542
Yes, Sir. I did.

03:05.125 --> 03:08.375
Always seem to catch me
at an embarrassing moment.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.542
Or maybe you just scratch your butt a lot.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.417
- Hey, dad.
- Oh hey!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.542
Honey, you know what would be
a great place to video chat?

03:14.667 --> 03:15.834
Not the kitchen.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.291
Okay.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.583
Now, where were we?

03:22.250 --> 03:23.375
So listen. Um...

03:23.917 --> 03:25.625
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

03:25.917 --> 03:29.041
Yeah, of course. You can tell me
anything. We're friends.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.000
I have a date tonight.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.083
Oh.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.875
Well, that's great. I mean, we knew
this would happen at some point.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.458
And you're okay?

03:40.542 --> 03:41.750
Yeah. Of course.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.041
Tell me about her.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.333
She's smart. And beautiful.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.250
Okay, that's enough. I'm good.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.250
Wow.

03:59.709 --> 04:02.834
First day of cooking school.
How exciting is this?

04:03.208 --> 04:05.083
- I'm PJ.
- I'm Winnie.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.083
But back in school, people
always called me Lose-y.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.458
People can be so mean.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.458
That is kind of clever though.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.458
My brother took this class.

04:16.709 --> 04:18.959
He said the teacher always chooses
one guy to pick on,

04:19.166 --> 04:20.917
and I just know that guy's gonna be me.

04:21.417 --> 04:23.875
Back in school, people
always called me Lose-y.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.500
We covered that.

04:26.583 --> 04:27.875
Good morning, students.

04:28.417 --> 04:31.250
And welcome to the Wainwright Academy

04:31.333 --> 04:34.083
of Culinary and Kitchen Operations.

04:34.458 --> 04:35.667
Better known as...

04:36.041 --> 04:37.375
"WACKO".

04:39.000 --> 04:41.542
My name is Chef Byron Wainwright.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.500
But from now on,

04:43.583 --> 04:45.834
you should only call me Chef.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.542
As in "yes, Chef".

04:48.125 --> 04:49.125
"No, Chef".

04:49.709 --> 04:51.375
And "you're quite brilliant, Chef".

04:52.959 --> 04:54.834
Now, everyone, take out your knives.

05:03.250 --> 05:04.166
Hello.

05:05.959 --> 05:06.792
Hi.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.250
What is your name?

05:10.125 --> 05:11.166
I'm PJ.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.834
Does that stand for "Pathetic Jerk"?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.875
No. It stands for Potty John.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.041
Potty John?

05:19.834 --> 05:21.291
That is actually your name?

05:21.917 --> 05:24.208
- Yes, Chef.
- And you shared that out loud?

05:24.417 --> 05:26.458
- Yes, Chef.
- Was that a good idea?

05:26.709 --> 05:27.792
No, Chef.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.667
I think you're the guy.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.291
Thanks.

05:39.583 --> 05:42.458
Yeah. This is the one your mom wants.
Rght, Gabe?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.458
Gabe?

05:44.792 --> 05:46.250
Hey, dad. Come over here.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.333
Check this out.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.083
Oh!

05:51.166 --> 05:52.917
Triple recliner.

05:54.583 --> 05:56.834
It's called "The Relaxinator 3000".

05:56.917 --> 05:58.542
It's got built-in surround sound.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.542
What?

06:01.375 --> 06:02.750
And a mini fridge!

06:03.291 --> 06:04.500
Are you kidding me?

06:04.583 --> 06:07.125
No more getting up and going all the way
into the kitchen?

06:07.458 --> 06:09.834
- When did we arrive at the future?
- Oh.

06:10.625 --> 06:14.333
This couch is so great.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.125
- Hey, let's get this one instead.
- No.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.500
We are getting the couch your mom wants.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.208
Push that button.

06:22.959 --> 06:23.834
Oh!

06:23.917 --> 06:25.667
- It's massaging me.
- Yeah.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.458
Oh, we gotta make this work.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.166
I don't know. I guess...

06:37.583 --> 06:40.125
Maybe I just wasn't ready
for Spencer to start dating.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.834
This is why I never stay friends
with any of my ex-boyfriends.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.125
I'm more of a love-'em-and-leave-'em type.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.625
Yeah. Well, that's easy for you to say.
You dated Emmett.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.709
I'm not talking about Emmett.
I'm talking about Raymond.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.500
Didn't Raymond break up with you?

06:55.583 --> 06:57.083
When did we start talking about me?

06:59.875 --> 07:01.417
Maybe you should start dating too.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.667
There's got to be somebody
you have your eye on.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.125
Well,

07:05.542 --> 07:06.750
actually...

07:07.375 --> 07:08.583
There is, uh,

07:08.667 --> 07:10.792
one special fella on the old...

07:11.250 --> 07:13.250
Teddy Duncan boy-dar.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.834
Ease into it, girl.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.458
His name is Zack.

07:19.875 --> 07:21.000
He works at the Mall.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.250
- Is he cute?
- Is he cute?

07:23.750 --> 07:25.375
Oh, he is way cute.

07:25.917 --> 07:28.417
He puts the "U" in cute.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.917
I'm talking cute-alicious.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.458
Yeah, ease way into it, girl.

07:40.959 --> 07:45.500
Let's see how your tomato sauce is coming.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.542
Hope you enjoy it, Chef.

07:51.709 --> 07:52.709
Rancid.

07:53.041 --> 07:54.875
Putrid. Inedible.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.333
Whoa.

07:56.417 --> 07:58.000
Good thing I only know one of those words.

07:58.583 --> 08:00.083
Class dismissed.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.125
You're coming back tomorrow, right?

08:09.083 --> 08:09.917
Chef,

08:10.250 --> 08:11.333
can I talk to you?

08:11.417 --> 08:12.667
Yes, Potty?

08:13.625 --> 08:15.458
I just wanna tell you a little bit
about myself,

08:16.125 --> 08:17.291
PJ...

08:17.750 --> 08:19.875
Which is what most people
really enjoy calling me.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.166
Oh, good. The PJ story.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.333
I've been dying to find out more.

08:25.667 --> 08:26.875
Well,

08:27.375 --> 08:29.458
I've always been really good
at cooking, and...

08:29.959 --> 08:32.333
my parents are paying a
lot of money for me to be here.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.917
What I'm saying is,
I don't wanna be the guy.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.333
The guy?

08:37.417 --> 08:39.750
I've heard you always
choose one guy to pick on.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.667
I don't wanna be him.

08:43.542 --> 08:45.667
I didn't realize that I pick a guy.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.000
But now that I think
about it, I guess I do.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.458
My goodness.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.792
I've been doing it all these years.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.959
You've really held a mirror up to me.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.125
I need to make a change.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.500
Next year.

09:07.667 --> 09:08.750
Till then,

09:09.166 --> 09:10.667
you're the guy.

09:13.041 --> 09:13.917
You know, Sir,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.959
- Winnie is not--
- Get out!

09:22.375 --> 09:24.583
All right. Hon'! The couch is here.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.250
Amy: Woo!

09:26.333 --> 09:28.250
This is so exciting. Let me see.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.417
What is that?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.041
That's what I'd like to know.

09:36.291 --> 09:39.959
Guys, you spend all afternoon
going downtown to buy a tasteful couch,

09:40.041 --> 09:42.542
and then we end up with this monstrosity?

09:42.625 --> 09:44.792
It's a disappointment. That's what it is.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.375
It'll be a few days until we can
get the right couch delivered.

09:48.458 --> 09:49.625
Oh!

09:49.709 --> 09:53.083
Well, you may as well leave this
one so we got somewhere to sit.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.792
Beats the floor.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.041
- Barely.
- Oh.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.834
Oh, I can't even look at it.

10:01.875 --> 10:04.166
- Nicely done.
- Thanks.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.291
Well, plug it in!

10:09.083 --> 10:11.000
Let's start relaxinating!

10:13.583 --> 10:14.792
Okay.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.417
Oh, there we go.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.834
Oh, my first date post-Spencer.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.208
This is so exciting.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.750
I know. So how did you get Zack
to go out with you?

10:27.834 --> 10:29.959
- I gave him the look.
- What's the look?

10:30.041 --> 10:30.792
It's...

10:36.709 --> 10:38.667
Nice. I'll have to try that.

10:38.959 --> 10:40.417
What, you don't have a look?

10:40.667 --> 10:41.792
I have a laugh.

10:46.667 --> 10:47.709
Stop.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.667
Oh, that's good.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.875
I'm saying.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
That's him.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.500
You know, I have to say it
feels good to be moving on.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.792
Yep. Bye-bye, Spencer.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.083
Both: Hi.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.166
And welcome back, Spencer.

11:17.917 --> 11:20.500
Zack, this is Ivy. Ivy, Zack.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.250
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.000
In fact, I feel like I already know you.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.750
That is so sweet, Ivy.

11:28.542 --> 11:29.417
Is it?

11:30.417 --> 11:31.917
Well, I gotta go.

11:32.166 --> 11:35.291
But first, can I have a special
goodbye with you in the kitchen?

11:35.375 --> 11:37.208
- Well, why can't we just--
- In the kitchen, T!

11:37.291 --> 11:39.458
It's not special unless
it's in the kitchen.

11:39.542 --> 11:40.500
Okay.

11:44.417 --> 11:45.750
What is going on?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.750
Zack looks exactly like Spencer.

11:47.834 --> 11:50.000
What? No he doesn't.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.542
Are you kidding me? They could be twins.

11:52.959 --> 11:53.917
Well, I don't see it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.667
You know what this means, don't you?

11:55.917 --> 11:57.500
Mm-hmm. You're not over Spencer.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.250
That is ridiculous. I am so over Spencer.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.458
Fine,

12:01.542 --> 12:02.625
pretend it isn't weird...

12:02.709 --> 12:04.166
even though it is.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.500
This is the worst special goodbye
that we've ever had.

12:08.583 --> 12:09.458
Oh...

12:12.500 --> 12:14.208
- Say goodbye to Ivy.
- Goodbye, Ivy.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.625
Bye, Zack.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.250
Have fun, you two.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.959
So, um, what do you wanna do?

12:32.041 --> 12:33.959
Grab some pizza, catch a movie?

12:35.083 --> 12:36.208
You know what might be fun?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.208
Makeovers.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.500
Makeovers.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.417
Why?

12:44.542 --> 12:45.667
Well...

12:46.083 --> 12:47.959
I just think that it would be super neat,

12:48.041 --> 12:50.375
if we look completely different
than we do right now.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.041
Let's start with you.

12:59.792 --> 13:02.291
Hey. There's my favorite cooking student.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.834
How's school going?

13:05.375 --> 13:06.500
It's pretty good.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.583
Really?

13:09.875 --> 13:11.291
Yeah. It's not bad.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.208
- 'cause you know, you're crying.
- Mm-hm.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.250
Yeah, onions.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.667
- That cooking school's terrible.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

13:23.250 --> 13:25.458
It's a complete disaster, Dad.
I'm gonna drop out.

13:25.542 --> 13:29.333
PJ, come on. You can't quit cooking
school. You're following your dream.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.625
Well, my dream has turned
into a nightmare.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.500
If you quit, is the
money we paid refundable?

13:34.583 --> 13:35.417
No.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.333
Well,

13:36.417 --> 13:38.458
Then that really is bad news.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.458
What are we gonna do?

13:41.625 --> 13:42.500
Um,

13:42.583 --> 13:44.375
I think we need to step away
from the onions.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.208
Okay.

13:49.542 --> 13:50.709
Wow.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.625
Look.

13:54.125 --> 13:58.333
Sometimes things aren't gonna be easy, but
that doesn't mean you can just give up.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.333
Why not?

13:59.417 --> 14:01.125
Because you're good at cooking.

14:01.583 --> 14:02.792
You're really good.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.542
I can't tell you what to do.

14:06.834 --> 14:07.709
But...

14:08.875 --> 14:09.750
I think...

14:10.709 --> 14:12.375
so long as you believe in yourself,

14:13.333 --> 14:14.458
you're gonna do great.

14:16.417 --> 14:17.834
I'll give it one more day.

14:17.917 --> 14:19.125
Oh, yes!

14:20.333 --> 14:21.417
There we go.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.041
Are you happy because this is
what I should be doing,

14:24.125 --> 14:25.750
or because you won't lose
your tuition money?

14:28.125 --> 14:29.333
What? Coming!

14:35.709 --> 14:36.834
Wow.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.667
You look great.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.333
I do?

14:41.875 --> 14:44.458
Oh. Oh yeah. Completely different.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.875
And, you know, I must say,

14:46.959 --> 14:49.166
you're rocking my cowboy boots.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.750
It's amazing they fit.

14:51.834 --> 14:53.208
Yeah, they really don't.

14:54.583 --> 14:55.625
Look.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.291
I like you and everything, but...

15:00.375 --> 15:02.417
This is all kind of weird.

15:04.041 --> 15:05.000
What's going on?

15:05.709 --> 15:06.834
What do you mean?

15:09.208 --> 15:12.291
I may be a blonde now, but I still know
something isn't right here.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.125
All right, Zack. Uh...

15:17.458 --> 15:18.667
Here's the thing.

15:18.750 --> 15:19.792
So,

15:19.875 --> 15:22.875
you happen to look a lot
like my ex-boyfriend,

15:23.458 --> 15:25.709
which would bring up the
whole disturbing question,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.083
"Is that the only reason
I'm attracted to you?"

15:28.166 --> 15:30.667
Which is why I wanted
to change your look...

15:30.750 --> 15:32.375
to prove that that wasn't the case.

15:32.709 --> 15:33.875
And...

15:34.583 --> 15:36.250
now that I've done that...

15:37.166 --> 15:39.417
and you look completely different...

15:40.667 --> 15:42.750
- Well...
- You're not interested anymore?

15:43.208 --> 15:44.834
Not so much.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.083
Maybe you shouldn't be dating yet.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.000
Maybe I shouldn't.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.417
This will wash out, right?

15:56.792 --> 15:57.875
Yeah.

16:02.375 --> 16:04.166
I really shouldn't be dating yet.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.041
Hey, look at you.

16:12.458 --> 16:14.583
Glad to see you taking on
some responsibility.

16:14.667 --> 16:15.917
Oh, please.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.166
The only reason I'm doing this is because
Mom hasn't left the couch in five hours.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.875
Your mom likes the couch now?

16:21.959 --> 16:22.959
Likes it?

16:23.375 --> 16:24.542
Go see for yourself.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.500
Did you see that?

16:29.875 --> 16:30.750
Honey?

16:31.834 --> 16:32.875
What you doing?

16:32.959 --> 16:35.417
Oh, loving the new couch, Bob.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.917
Oh, I was so wrong about the other one.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.792
- It's heaven, isn't it, Charlie?
- Loving it.

16:44.709 --> 16:47.000
Well, I'm... I'm glad you like it.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.208
Um, but there's stuff around
here that needs to be done.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.750
Oh, then do it.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.166
Honey, what about dinner?

16:54.250 --> 16:55.208
Oh.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.250
Dinner sounds great.
What do you think, Charlie?

16:57.375 --> 16:58.542
I can eat.

17:03.625 --> 17:06.834
Hey, hey, hey. We gotta do something.
We created a monster.

17:06.917 --> 17:08.583
I know. It's not fair.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.625
They're just sitting there doing nothing.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.917
Dad, that was gonna be our thing.

17:13.792 --> 17:16.291
We should have just bought the couch
your mom told us to buy.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.625
This is what I get for
thinking for myself.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.417
You didn't think for yourself.
Dad, I told you what to do.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.000
Hey, I am still your father

17:24.083 --> 17:26.709
and I am the one who should be
coming up with the plans here.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.458
And I'm open to any
input you two might have.

17:37.250 --> 17:39.250
I will now sample your gazpachos.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.041
Bland. Boring.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.792
Winnie, if you ever open a Restaurant,
you should call it "Losey's".

17:52.000 --> 17:53.500
And there it is.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.417
Ah.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.333
Gazpacho a la Potty.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.417
Taste buds,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.208
prepare to die.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.125
That's odd.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.208
Confirming my initial impression.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.542
This is not completely horrible.

18:21.625 --> 18:22.750
Yes!

18:22.834 --> 18:24.375
Not completely horrible!

18:25.375 --> 18:27.250
I believed in myself and it paid off!

18:27.500 --> 18:28.875
Woo-hoo!

18:28.959 --> 18:30.709
Dial it down, Potty.

18:31.125 --> 18:33.125
It's just some vegetables in a blender.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.250
This is the best day of my life.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.291
Are you crying?

18:41.583 --> 18:42.750
Are there onions around?

18:42.834 --> 18:44.500
- No.
- Then I guess I am.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.917
So, I have a funny story to tell you.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.542
It's about this guy I dated.

18:55.625 --> 18:58.917
- Oh, you're dating.
- Well, I mean it was just one date.

18:59.709 --> 19:02.375
- So, what happened?
- Here's the funny part.

19:02.917 --> 19:07.041
I realized that the only reason
I wanted to date him,

19:07.125 --> 19:08.625
was because...

19:08.709 --> 19:09.709
Oh, hang on.

19:09.834 --> 19:12.250
Hey. Oh, come in. This is great.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.417
As long as you're here, there's
someone I want you to meet.

19:14.875 --> 19:16.291
This is Gigi.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.250
The girl I'm dating.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.750
How you doing?

19:23.959 --> 19:25.583
Nice to meet you.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.875
So Teddy, what did you wanna tell me?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.542
Um...

19:30.083 --> 19:32.000
You know what, you guys go have fun.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.583
It can wait.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.667
And so can I.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.375
- It's so fun to go...
- Hey.

19:47.458 --> 19:51.291
Hey, guys. What happened?
Where's my couch?

19:51.375 --> 19:52.500
This is your couch.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.458
Yeah, the one you wanted
in the first place.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.959
But I like the other couch now.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.458
This one's good too.

19:59.542 --> 20:01.625
Come on, come on. Sit down. Try it out.

20:02.458 --> 20:04.417
Try it out. There we go. There we go.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.875
Bob: Yeah. No, no, no.

20:06.959 --> 20:08.250
No, no, no.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.709
There's no buttons. This is for the TV.

20:12.709 --> 20:14.000
Where's the cooler?

20:14.792 --> 20:16.083
There is no cooler either.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.834
If you want something to drink,
you have to go into the kitchen.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.083
You remember the kitchen, right?

20:21.959 --> 20:23.583
That's where the dinner comes from.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.250
All right, Dad. Let's give her a minute.

20:34.709 --> 20:38.083
And that is how Mommy got the
couch she wanted all along.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.291
You're good, Mommy.

20:40.709 --> 20:41.834
I know.

20:42.917 --> 20:44.166
And scary.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.417
Thank you.

20:53.166 --> 20:57.834
Hey, Charlie. So, pretty exciting
first week back in the Duncan house.

20:58.166 --> 20:59.375
We got a new couch,

20:59.959 --> 21:02.542
PJ almost quit another school.

21:02.834 --> 21:07.000
And I went on a date with a guy
who looked a lot like Spencer.

21:07.792 --> 21:08.750
He used to.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.458
Now, he's blonde...

21:10.750 --> 21:12.375
and angry.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.250
And he walks with a limp.

21:16.667 --> 21:17.542
What... Dad!

21:17.625 --> 21:19.291
I'm doing the video diary.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.333
Oh! I gotta get this looked at.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.917
If he's still doing
that when you're my age,

21:26.458 --> 21:28.834
I should probably wish you both
good luck, Charlie.

21:30.041 --> 21:32.166
Don't touch the food now!

21:38.959 --> 21:42.166
If you like a guy and the laugh
doesn't work, then what do you do?

21:42.667 --> 21:44.333
I go with the bigger laugh, girl.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.417
Woo!

21:53.041 --> 21:54.250
Yeah, that's good.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.917
So, what if your look doesn't work?
What do you do?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.417
Then I do the walk.

22:10.834 --> 22:11.792
I like it.

22:11.875 --> 22:12.875
I like it.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.500
I also have a special call.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.709
Check it out.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.583
Well, if their not into that,

22:26.041 --> 22:27.250
they might be into this...
