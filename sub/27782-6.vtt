WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:02.801
ex may be the king
of Siesta Key,

00:02.870 --> 00:05.938
but this summer
I'm the queen.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.906
We miss you,
and, like, it sucks.

00:07.975 --> 00:10.309
Hey, can you not
touch hands?

00:10.378 --> 00:11.877
(both laughing)

00:11.946 --> 00:13.445
(Juliette)
Cara's using both Garrett

00:13.514 --> 00:15.681
and Chloe to get closer
to Alex.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.516
Cara seems like
the type of person

00:17.585 --> 00:20.586
that's always just gonna,
like, come after you.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.954
(Juliette)
But at least Chloe's finally

00:22.023 --> 00:23.689
clued into Cara's bull(bleep).

00:23.758 --> 00:25.891
Do you not understand why
that would be a betrayal?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.826
You know (bleep), dude.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.361
(Juliette)
Brandon, on the other hand,

00:29.430 --> 00:30.829
totally clueless.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.765
I have a song
that I'm coming out with.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.433
Are you down to be in
a music video?

00:34.502 --> 00:35.734
Yes, yes.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.102
(Juliette)
When he asked Madisson

00:37.171 --> 00:38.871
to be the romantic lead
in his music video,

00:38.939 --> 00:41.340
it pissed literally
everyone off.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.641
What the (bleep)
just happened?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.876
Like, why would
you do that?

00:43.944 --> 00:46.011
I'm so, like,
thrown off by that.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.613
(Juliette)
Madisson should be careful.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.949
Ben may be new to our crew,
but he's already got options.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.052
Does that mean
you're actually together?

00:53.120 --> 00:55.287
(chuckling)
Why are you asking?

00:55.356 --> 00:57.089
Why do you think?

00:57.158 --> 00:59.491
(Juliette)
Canvas has bigger
relationship problems.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.959
Mama's back.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.761
(Juliette)
Both with her mother...

01:02.830 --> 01:04.696
What is it that
I'm not doing?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.799
Acknowledge the fact
and really, actually
own up to maybe the fact--

01:06.867 --> 01:08.534
Show me, 'cause I don't
know how to do it.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.436
(Juliette)
...and with her best friend.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.704
I always just kinda thought,
like, we were just friends.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.007
I don't really date girls.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.809
(Juliette)
Something's happening
in Siesta Key,

01:16.877 --> 01:19.111
and somehow I feel like
no one's relationship

01:19.180 --> 01:23.315
is safe this summer...
not even mine.

Oh, look who it is!

02:15.102 --> 02:16.768
The newest couple
in the town.

02:16.837 --> 02:20.305
(Juliette)
Cara and Garrett-- can we
just call 'em "Carrett"?

02:20.374 --> 02:23.175
They're the Key's newest
and most unexpected couple.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.611
If you ask me,
it's just weird.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.713
But it doesn't change the fact

02:27.781 --> 02:29.615
that whenever Cara
is around Alex,

02:29.683 --> 02:30.782
all they do is flirt.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.117
Hey, guys!

02:32.186 --> 02:33.919
(man)
Oh, with the Balenciago bag.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.522
It's Valentino.
Thank you, though.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.691
(laughter)

02:39.760 --> 02:41.527
(Juliette)
Cheers!

02:41.595 --> 02:43.529
(Alex)
Summer in Siesta Key!

02:43.597 --> 02:47.499
(Chloe)
Oh my God!
What do we do?!

02:53.073 --> 02:55.674
(Juliette)
Garrett, stop looking at me.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.644
You looked at me!

02:58.712 --> 03:02.214
Pretend you like me, please.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.372
Why is it your fault?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.274
I literally don't know.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.710
She said that
I looked at her.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.512
I guess, like,
I can't look at people

03:33.581 --> 03:35.214
or look around.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.216
What up?
Why are you mad at Ju?

03:37.284 --> 03:39.351
She just provokes me.
Whatever she--

03:39.420 --> 03:41.286
She told Garrett to
stop looking at her.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.088
Yeah, but now--
Wouldn't you rather
have a girlfriend

03:43.157 --> 03:44.590
that tells her ex to stop?
No, I have--

03:44.658 --> 03:46.225
I have a hot girlfriend,
that's gonna happen,

03:46.293 --> 03:47.926
but she does it
and looks at me right away,

03:47.995 --> 03:49.494
like, to try to provoke me.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.063
'Cause you're my boyfriend,

03:51.131 --> 03:52.431
and when someone's looking
at me weird,

03:52.499 --> 03:54.433
I'm like, this (bleep) guy's
looking at me weird.

03:54.501 --> 03:57.536
All right, so, a girl
that I've hooked up with,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.371
and we're out,
and I'm gonna be like,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.006
"Oh my God, she keeps
looking at me,"

04:01.075 --> 04:02.808
we'll see how
you react to it.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.509
Wanna try it out?

04:04.578 --> 04:07.212
How many of
your ex-girlfriends
am I around right now?

04:07.281 --> 04:09.014
How many of the girls
have you banged...

04:09.083 --> 04:10.415
But I don't literally--
...am I around right now?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.284
I don't bring it
to your attention

04:12.353 --> 04:13.952
that they're looking at me.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.388
I'm not gonna let you drag
me down, that's the problem.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.056
You dragged me down.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.626
Then go drag your ass
(bleep) somewhere else.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.561
Whatever.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.130
(Paul)
How does he drag you down?
He pays for everything.

04:25.199 --> 04:27.332
I literally put
this bitch on a pedestal.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.735
He literally goes
out of his way to
make you happy.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.303
My cousin hates pasta,

04:31.372 --> 04:33.071
he's cooking you pasta
with salmon last night.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.806
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.141
I know what
I'm talking about,

04:36.210 --> 04:38.243
I know Alex way better
than you, honey.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.945
That has nothing to do with
what we're talking about.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.380
Well, I guarantee you
he cares about me

04:41.448 --> 04:44.850
way more than
he does about you.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.653
You better get
the (bleep) up right now,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.721
or I'm gonna pour this drink
all over your (bleep) face.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.491
You've disrespected my cousin
for the last (bleep) time.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.992
Get out, get out.
I'm not going anywhere.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.127
Walk away.
I'm not going
anywhere.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.595
Your stupid-ass
inside-out shirt.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.563
Idiot.
Juliette, are you
really gonna blame

04:58.632 --> 05:00.399
your relationship
problems on me?

05:00.467 --> 05:04.036
Are you not gonna do
anything about this?

05:07.608 --> 05:09.341
I'm not getting
involved with you.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.276
You're literally
a (bleep) loser, Juliette.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.913
No, no one's even explaining
what the hell's going on.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.181
Paul, go away.
You and I,

05:16.250 --> 05:18.116
we're broken up right now.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.352
Get up, I'm leaving.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.355
(Alex)
I'm shaking in my boots.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.923
(Paul)
Alex is always gonna like me
better than you, hon.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.558
Go away.
So, don't let the door

05:26.627 --> 05:29.161
hit you and your
fake-ass purse on the way out.

05:29.229 --> 05:33.265
Oh, shoot, I'm single.
(chuckling)

05:33.334 --> 05:37.302
(bleep) right.
I'm single.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.906
(Juliette, crying)
Alex is a stupid
boyfriend. We're done!

05:40.974 --> 05:43.175
(laughing)

05:43.243 --> 05:44.676
Oh, Juliette, Juliette,

05:44.745 --> 05:46.645
"Days of Our Lives,"
did you see that episode?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.748
(Cara)
It's 'cause Garrett's
blond-tipped hair!

05:49.817 --> 05:51.550
It's all your fault.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.218
Just take
a deep breath, though.

05:53.287 --> 05:54.753
I'm going home.
Okay.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.421
Just take a deep breath.

06:01.095 --> 06:02.694
Like, I do everything
for that girl.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.262
I mean, I didn't
do anything wrong.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.131
You didn't do
a thing wrong.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.833
You've done too much,
you've spoiled her.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.001
Now, I'm gonna
steal Cara back.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.503
What?!
You wanna bet?

06:11.572 --> 06:15.607
(laughter)

06:15.676 --> 06:17.576
Do you not give
a (bleep) about Juliette?

06:17.644 --> 06:19.745
Are you done?
You never want to
be with her again?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.313
Do you not love her?

06:21.382 --> 06:24.116
I do.
Go after your girl.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.751
No.
(man)
It's raining.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.319
I did nothing wrong!
You let-- you let
Paul attack her

06:27.388 --> 06:29.020
and you didn't
defend her at all.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.490
What's wrong with you?!
It's all your fault,
apparently.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.458
I think she's jealous
of my highlights.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.560
She's like, "Why can't
my highlights
look that nice?"

06:35.629 --> 06:38.163
(Chloe)
It's not how a man
should treat his girlfriend.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.265
You should (bleep)...
I didn't do anything wrong.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.167
Your own cousin
just attacked her.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.202
Everything he said
was the truth.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.472
That's disgusting.
You're disgusting.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.209
We'll see how long
this breakup lasts.

06:51.278 --> 06:56.148
Cara! Cara!
I need company.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.183
Hold on,
I'll be right back.

06:58.252 --> 07:01.453
Are you going
over there?

07:01.522 --> 07:03.422
I don't... whatever.

07:03.490 --> 07:07.325
Watch my Balenciaga-Valentino
bag, please, thank you.

07:07.394 --> 07:10.595
(Chloe)
Cara, don't do that.
What are you doing?

07:10.664 --> 07:12.364
Sit right next
to Santa's lap.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.366
What do you want
for Christmas?

07:14.435 --> 07:14.866
As far away
as I can be.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.169
For what?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.438
You don't think
I'm getting you back?

07:19.506 --> 07:23.041
I know you're in happy,
happy everland with Garrett,

07:23.110 --> 07:24.876
but you always
give me that look.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.913
Like, I don't need
to elaborate.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.749
I'd go say something
if I were you.

07:30.818 --> 07:34.319
(Chloe)
Smile!

07:34.388 --> 07:35.554
Cheers!

07:35.622 --> 07:37.522
Juliette's gonna love it!

07:39.927 --> 07:42.027
Can you get a little
closer, please?

07:42.095 --> 07:45.197
No, no.
No.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.966
You think it's so funny.
You love to see me suffer.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.670
I do, I love it.

07:51.738 --> 07:55.340
(phone vibrating, chimes)

08:03.183 --> 08:06.651
(Juliette)
Excuse me, can you please
take me back to the bar?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.091
(rain falling)

08:16.096 --> 08:18.930
(people chattering)

08:18.999 --> 08:20.499
(Paul)
Oh, (bleep).

08:29.676 --> 08:33.278
Okay, so why did you go up
and talk to Alex?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.881
You know, if I was
around, you would
never have done that.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.916
It wasn't a big
(bleep) deal.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.951
Would you have dragged
Alex over there

08:40.020 --> 08:41.319
if I was standing
right there at the bar?

08:41.388 --> 08:42.754
I didn't drag him here.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.357
Okay, well, one of you
initiated the conversation.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.492
I don't come up to Garrett.
I wouldn't do that.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.861
I wouldn't be like, "Garrett,
come on, let's talk."

08:49.930 --> 08:51.429
We already, like, all think

08:51.498 --> 08:54.032
you're not even really
truly into Garrett.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.902
You're here for a reason.
Don't tell me you're not.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.104
Dude, I have
(bleep) apartments
all around the world.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.273
Why would I come here,
you stupid (bleep)?

09:01.341 --> 09:04.142
'Cause you piss me off,
that's why you're here.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.611
And you know that.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.123
Hi.
That's messed up.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.892
Like, how can you just
dump me like that?

09:20.961 --> 09:22.594
Garrett was staring at me.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.496
You're a pretty girl,
he's gonna stare at you.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.531
Regardless, I go,
"Stop looking at me."

09:26.600 --> 09:28.567
It looked like you were
trying to provoke me.
I thought--

09:28.635 --> 09:30.135
I honestly thought
you would have been,

09:30.203 --> 09:32.337
like, happy that
I did that, 'cause I--

09:32.406 --> 09:35.407

You broke up with me.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.142

You hurt me, you didn't--

No, I'm not. Listen.
Fine, I'm gonna walk away.

Okay, fine.
Stop!

That's exactly my point.

gonna go back to Australia.

Okay.

with a question,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.627
like, would you be willing
to be in my music video,

16:02.696 --> 16:04.963

way back when, like,

16:08.201 --> 16:10.601

you worried about?

it's like invasive of him

19:15.355 --> 19:17.221
why you would ever even
talk (bleep) about me.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.323
I've been nothing but
a good friend to you,

19:19.392 --> 19:21.659
and I have no idea why
you would ever say, like,

19:21.728 --> 19:24.462
I'm too much to handle,
or you can't stand me,

19:24.531 --> 19:25.730
I'm annoying.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.632
Chloe, that wasn't me
talking (bleep).

19:27.700 --> 19:31.402
Like, what I said to Alex
was the same things
I would say to your face.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.437
But you didn't.
Like, you also know
you're a lot to handle.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.106
Like, that's the thing.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.008
I totally get
why you feel that way.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.143
But at the end of the day,
like, I still stand

19:39.212 --> 19:41.812
with my feelings,
and it really hurt to hear

19:41.881 --> 19:44.515
that you were talking
crap about me.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.118
Listen, I'm sorry
for what I said

19:47.187 --> 19:48.586
and for who I told it to,

19:48.655 --> 19:50.588
but you just need
to understand how I feel.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.757
Like, at the gala,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.692
I was completely
attacked by you,

19:54.761 --> 19:58.362
and you were also standing
alongside Alex and Juliette,

19:58.431 --> 20:00.431
these people that just
don't like me

20:00.500 --> 20:02.366
or have had
a problem with me.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.035
Yeah, no, I--
I get that.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.938
I mean, honestly,
like, since Miami,

20:07.006 --> 20:09.807
I feel like you've treated me
as like a second-tier friend,

20:09.876 --> 20:13.044
and, like, obviously,
that makes me upset.

20:13.112 --> 20:16.614
But sending that picture
to Juliette just really
was not cool.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.953
I wanted to show Juliette,

20:22.021 --> 20:23.454
like, see, the second
you leave,

20:23.523 --> 20:25.790
look at what he's doing.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.059
And I'm sorry that you just
happened to be the one,

20:28.127 --> 20:29.860
but I don't even know
why you were going

20:29.929 --> 20:33.397
over there anyway,
when you were with Garrett.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.968
Looking back, like, I don't
feel good about the situation

20:37.036 --> 20:39.070
because it looked
really bad on Garrett.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.205
And I know he was upset
about the whole situation.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.675
So, I did not like hurting
Garrett's feelings

20:44.744 --> 20:46.310
because, like,
surprisingly enough,

20:46.379 --> 20:49.180
I'm starting to have, like,
real feelings for him.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.015
Really?
Yes.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.319
So, I obviously don't plan on
doing that ever again to him.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.789
But it's a little bit
of a stab in the back

20:58.858 --> 21:00.758
for you to just, like,
go out of your way

21:00.827 --> 21:03.794
to take a picture of me
and text it to her.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.297
Like, you knew
she was gonna have a fit.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.503
You're completely
in the right
about that part.

21:12.572 --> 21:15.339
The way I handled it
was so poorly.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.109
I'm-- I am sorry that
I came at you that way.

21:18.177 --> 21:21.012
I never want you to feel
attacked by me, especially.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.081
Yeah, it was not fun.
Yeah.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.516
But thank you,
I'm glad you can, like,

21:25.585 --> 21:27.985
admit that it wasn't such--
No, 100-- no, no, no,

21:28.054 --> 21:30.988
100% I was in the wrong.
...such a great approach.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.723
I just don't want them
to come in between us.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.592
I know, I agree.
We need to stick together.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.661
For sure.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.830
♪♪

21:45.138 --> 21:47.972
(sighing)
Oh, it's such a nice day.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.407
Yeah, it really is,
it's amazing.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.142
So, how are you feeling?

21:51.210 --> 21:52.810
'Cause I know
you went through a lot.

21:52.879 --> 21:56.113
Like, I'm exhausted.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.983
That's why we're here
in Siesta Key relaxing,

21:59.052 --> 22:00.785
the most beautiful
place in the world.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.121
All right, so you
ready to talk about
your mom conversation?

22:04.190 --> 22:05.756
How did it go?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.192
I think it went...
well enough.

22:08.261 --> 22:10.294
I feel better.

22:10.363 --> 22:14.198
But I just-- it's definitely
just the very first baby step

22:14.267 --> 22:17.968
into what could
possibly be, if anything.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.637
'Cause I know one of, like,
the things we talked about,

22:19.706 --> 22:22.139
your goal was to get her to
realize what she did to you

22:22.208 --> 22:24.875
or how she affected your life
by the actions she made.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.678
I feel like--
Do you think that
she understood that?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.246
She's getting there.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.415
I have to see how she goes
from here on out,

22:31.484 --> 22:33.651
and like, what happens,
and like, if she's actually

22:33.720 --> 22:37.088
gonna take, like...
put the energy

22:37.156 --> 22:38.489
and to be a little
less selfish,

22:38.558 --> 22:40.424
and like, put energy into,
like, actually having

22:40.493 --> 22:43.194
a relationship and, like,
actually trying.

22:43.262 --> 22:46.163
I'm just scared that, like,
I'm gonna get attached

22:46.232 --> 22:48.199
and I'm gonna put
my emotions into something

22:48.267 --> 22:50.267
that I shouldn't
put my emotions into.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.869
In this situation
specifically,

22:51.938 --> 22:53.804
you need to let
yourself be vulnerable

22:53.873 --> 22:55.306
to getting hurt.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.708
(sighs)
I'm really (bleep) trying.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.810
I know you are.
That's good.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.381
I mean, letting yourself
be open is steps

23:03.449 --> 23:05.416
to making closer
connections with people.

23:05.485 --> 23:08.052
You sharing this with me
has made us so much closer.

23:08.121 --> 23:09.720
I know.
So, being vulnerable--

23:09.789 --> 23:12.156
And I wouldn't wanna (bleep)
talk to anyone else about it.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.958
I know.
Like, you're the only
person that doesn't judge me

23:14.026 --> 23:17.428
for all the (bleep) hot-mess
brokenness that I am.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.063
You're gonna get
through it.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.132
I'm being open.
I'm gonna be open to it.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.633
It's not like you're
ever gonna be alone.

23:22.702 --> 23:26.537
You're right.
You usually are.

23:29.809 --> 23:33.277
(Brandon)
So, there's a couple scenes
I wanna do for the video.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.346
Right.
And the first sort
of scene I wanna do

23:35.415 --> 23:37.314
is with Madisson on, like,
the pier right here,
on the top.

23:37.383 --> 23:40.584
Uh-huh?
And like, the part where,
like, you're singing,

23:40.653 --> 23:43.220
I want it to be
like right here, you know?

23:43.289 --> 23:44.955
Oh yeah!
That'd be so dope.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.390
(Juliette)
Brandon's making a music video

23:46.459 --> 23:48.926
about his relationship
with Madisson.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.361
Are you down to be in
a music video?

23:50.430 --> 23:51.462
Yes, yes.

23:51.531 --> 23:52.897
(Juliette)
And that's causing problems

23:52.965 --> 23:54.665
for his current girlfriend.

23:54.734 --> 23:55.666
What the (bleep)
just happened?

23:55.735 --> 23:57.101
Like, why would you do that?

23:57.170 --> 24:00.070
I wanna, like, sort of
relive the moments

24:00.139 --> 24:01.505
that me and Madisson had
when we were happy.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.340
And honestly,
the reason I chose it,

24:03.409 --> 24:05.309
it's so much more than just,
like, a nice beach.

24:05.378 --> 24:07.445
Like, this was,
like, the first place

24:07.513 --> 24:11.115
that me and Madisson became
official at as well.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.250
Does Camilla know that?

24:13.319 --> 24:17.121
I mean, Camilla will be here
to watch the video, you know?

24:17.190 --> 24:19.723
I mean, I think
it's kinda weird.

24:19.792 --> 24:20.958
I honestly think
it's weird.
Why?

24:21.027 --> 24:22.660
Because it's like,
when you write songs

24:22.728 --> 24:24.261
about exes,
that's one thing.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.830
But when you have 'em
in the video,

24:25.898 --> 24:28.866
it's just... weird.
Mm.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.901
I mean, I'm...
whatever you decide to do,

24:30.970 --> 24:33.871
and I know you want her
in the video, that's
completely fine.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.539
I mean, I get it.
And-- and I know,

24:35.608 --> 24:37.107
like, you think it's weird.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.843
Like, Camilla also thinks
it's really weird.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.045
And in my--
Camilla thinks it's weird

24:41.113 --> 24:42.980
that I'm in the video,
I'm sure, so...

24:43.049 --> 24:44.782
I mean, probably,
but you know, like...

24:44.851 --> 24:46.550
I don't know, that's just
something that, like,

24:46.619 --> 24:50.087
she still hasn't, like,
completely, like,

24:50.156 --> 24:51.856
gotten over yet,
is like, my lifestyle,

24:51.924 --> 24:53.324
and what's in my lifestyle.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.059
And like,
I completely understand

24:55.127 --> 24:57.061
where she's coming from,
because this is obviously

24:57.129 --> 24:58.963
so new to her and everything.
Yeah.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.232
But you're gonna be
performing and recording

25:01.300 --> 25:03.334
with a lot of women.
Yeah.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.135
There's obviously
gonna be groupies,

25:05.204 --> 25:06.871
there's gonna be
girls after you.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.539
Yeah.
That just comes
with the business.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.075
It does.
And she needs
to get over it.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.309
I-- what I try to do
is put myself

25:12.378 --> 25:14.144
in her, like,
position though, like...

25:14.213 --> 25:16.413
If I was in her shoes,
I would suck it up.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.716
No, and I get that.
Because I know my boyfriend,

25:18.784 --> 25:20.384
this is his passion,
this is something

25:20.453 --> 25:21.986
that he loves
and wants to do.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.354
Yeah, no,
you're absolutely right.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.389
So, how long is it
gonna get dragged out for?

25:25.458 --> 25:30.594
Because that can't affect you
and that can't affect me.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.430
Because then that means,
like, we can't work together.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.566
Or if we work together,
she can't be there.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.402
No, I agree.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.309
♪♪

25:45.378 --> 25:48.979
All right, let's see who
can catch one in their mouth.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.748
You suck.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.450
Okay, let's see
if I can do it.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.652
(gasps)

25:54.720 --> 25:56.053
That was a weak throw.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.788
Better throw than yours.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.623
So, what'd you do today?

25:59.692 --> 26:02.393
Um... not too much,
just the usual.

26:02.461 --> 26:03.827
What about you?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.729
I talked to Chloe earlier.

26:05.798 --> 26:06.964
Oh, man,
how'd that go?

26:07.033 --> 26:08.232
It was fine.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.800
She, like, claims
to feel really bad

26:09.869 --> 26:11.535
about the whole
gala situation.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.971
I don't know, I just,
like, don't understand

26:14.040 --> 26:16.340
how she thinks she can
talk to, like, her friends

26:16.409 --> 26:18.075
the way she talks
to her friends.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.644
She's literally been
like that since high school.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.212
Like, hasn't
changed one bit.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.948
She loves the drama.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.716
Yeah, that's how Chloe is.
Mm-hmm.

26:25.785 --> 26:30.020
She also tried to apologize
for sending the picture

26:30.089 --> 26:31.855
of Alex and I to Juliette.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.426
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.161
Mm.

26:37.229 --> 26:40.364
You have nothing
to say on that?
I mean...

26:40.433 --> 26:43.367
Didn't...
I just don't like seeing
you, like, around Alex.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.570
It just annoyed
the (bleep) out of me.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.472
I just don't really think
of it as a big deal.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.574
Like, if Paul or Brandon
called me over,

26:50.643 --> 26:52.376
I would have also
walked up to them

26:52.445 --> 26:54.511
and had a conversation
with them.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.747
Yeah, and I would have been
a lot more fine with that,

26:56.816 --> 26:59.917
because those are guys that
you actually didn't date.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.419
It pisses me off because
I just don't like the kid.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.221
Like, his intentions
are never good.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.589
They're always bad.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.725
Okay, like, I get it.
I just can't stand it.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.993
And I told you
that I feel bad.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.527
But like, we've talked
about this before,

27:10.596 --> 27:12.262
and it's, like,
starting to get annoying

27:12.331 --> 27:14.031
because it keeps coming up.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.966
And I know that
you feel bad,

27:16.035 --> 27:18.469
but like, we need
to let it go now.

27:18.537 --> 27:19.570
Yeah, we do.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.171
We need to stop
talking about it,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.007
and you also need to
stop talking to Alex.

27:23.075 --> 27:26.176
Got it, crystal clear.
Won't do it again.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.548
And can you stop doing that,
please, with your hand?

27:31.617 --> 27:34.518
Stop what?
Like, squeezing my fat.

27:34.587 --> 27:36.553
You know I don't like that
and you keep doing it.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.323
I'm not squeezing your fat,
I'm just holding your leg.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.026
No... you do it on purpose.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.028
No, I do it
as an affection,

27:44.096 --> 27:45.896
that you're very beautiful.
Okay, well, I'm just saying
that I've talked to you

27:45.965 --> 27:47.264
about this before,
and I don't like

27:47.333 --> 27:48.632
when you squeeze, like...

27:48.701 --> 27:50.100
I'm sorry.

How was Brandon's shoot?

37:28.714 --> 37:31.448
You know I wasn't, like,
super thrilled about that.

37:31.516 --> 37:33.516
Yeah, no, it actually
went really well.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.719
Did you have to do, like,
lovey-dovey Brandon stuff?

37:35.787 --> 37:37.887
Yes.
We were holding hands

37:37.956 --> 37:41.725
at one point, and then, like,
he kissed me on the cheek.

37:41.793 --> 37:45.262
But like, Brandon and I, like,
ended on a terrible note,

37:45.330 --> 37:47.530
and you know about, like,
what we went through.
Yeah, I get it.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.099
And so, for me, it was
really important to, like,

37:49.167 --> 37:51.368
come through and have, like,
a friendship with him.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.669
Like, that's
important to me.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.137
To, like, create
a friendship with him.

37:54.206 --> 37:55.639
Yeah, yeah.
And, like, I don't
want to have

37:55.707 --> 37:57.741
that negative energy,
and, like, the fact that

37:57.809 --> 37:59.509
we were able to do, like,
that music video together,

37:59.578 --> 38:02.045
it meant a lot.

38:02.114 --> 38:06.283
♪♪

38:06.351 --> 38:09.519
I think it's all
really weird, like, but...

38:09.588 --> 38:11.721
I don't think
it should be, though.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.357
Like, I don't think
it should be
a big deal at all.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.993
Yeah.
Okay.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.596
I mean, moving forward,
like, I think we should

38:19.665 --> 38:21.765
probably have better
communication as far
as this stuff.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.034
You know, like,
I'm moving here for you.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.870
I don't want you to
move here just for me.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.605
What do you mean?
Like, I'm not--

38:28.674 --> 38:30.840
Like, I want you here.
I do want you here.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.842
Yeah.
But I just don't
want the pressure

38:32.911 --> 38:37.247
of having me be the only
reason you're here.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.748
I mean, I just want to
make sure that

38:38.817 --> 38:40.183
you're just
as serious as I am,

38:40.252 --> 38:43.320
'cause, like, you are the reason
that I'm coming here.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.954
There's other things for me.
Ben, of course I'm serious.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.590
I'm just-- I don't
think at our age

38:47.659 --> 38:50.260
picking up and moving
to a whole new city

38:50.329 --> 38:53.596
just for a relationship
is necessarily
the best idea.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.866
I get it.
Just... act a little excited.

(Juliette)
I thought everything was okay,

39:16.321 --> 39:19.689
but then something
terrible happened.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.131
Hey, babe.

39:30.102 --> 39:33.069
You sounded upset.
Are you okay?

39:33.138 --> 39:35.538
Yeah... I'm all right.

39:35.607 --> 39:36.806
What's going on?

39:36.875 --> 39:39.809
Um...

39:39.878 --> 39:43.213
So I woke up really
early this morning,

39:43.281 --> 39:47.016
and I just, like,
felt the need

39:47.085 --> 39:49.719
to go to Alex's
to get my wallet.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.855
And, uh...

39:51.923 --> 39:55.091
'Cause, like, I just
had this weird feeling
in my stomach.

Alex is standing
in front of his room

39:57.529 --> 40:00.196
with a pair
of shorts on, no shirt.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.432
And there's a girl
in his bed.

40:02.501 --> 40:05.935
I literally walked in on him
sleeping with a girl.

40:06.004 --> 40:09.572
Don't cry, babe.
I know, I know.

I'm sorry.
It's the last thing

40:21.486 --> 40:22.685
in the world
I wanted to do.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.654
You did, though.
What were you thinking?

40:24.723 --> 40:27.857
If I lost Juliette,
that's gonna kill me.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.160
I'm gonna (bleep)
someone up!

Are you coming
to his tour?

No, actually, I'm not.
So, you're going?
Yeah, I'm performing.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.566
Oh, really?
Yeah.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.001
You hiding it from me
makes me think that,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.869
like, there's
something going on.
That what?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.504
So you don't trust me
is basically what
you're saying.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.273
You know who's still
texting me?
Who?

40:43.341 --> 40:45.141
Ben. Talking about
very sexual things.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.544
Like that he wants to
tie me to my headboard
and stuff like that.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.479
He's bad!
