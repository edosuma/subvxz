WEBVTT

00:56.139 --> 00:59.268
…a furnished basement
is quite unusual for the area.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.019
Fifteen-foot ceilings throughout.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.480
Library on the second floor
with the fireplace.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.276
Of course, the grand fireplace
is on the first floor.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.611
This is quite a desirable neighborhood.

01:09.695 --> 01:13.323
It's unusual to have three units
available here on Spruce Street.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.367
All right.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.954
Well, if you guys are ready,
we can take a look inside.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.250
Lovely neighborhood, isn't it?
Just a dream.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.127
Come on.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.171
Garlic. Try the garlic
and olive oil with that or--

02:51.255 --> 02:53.966
Jericho, look. Mommy's awake.
Say, "Hi, Mommy."

02:54.049 --> 02:55.425
-Hey, honey.
-Hey, Dottie.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.970
Hey, you hungry? Sit. I got breakfast.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.848
You want some juice?
I'll make you some juice.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.601
-There's coffee on the stove, Dorothy.
-Yeah, or coffee. Whatever you need.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.145
Figured today would be the day
you made it down,

03:07.229 --> 03:10.399
so I have a savory amaranth porridge,

03:10.482 --> 03:14.611
mulberry scones,
a satsuma preserve and slab bacon.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.614
How you feeling? Rested?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.491
Yeah, well, trazodone will do that.

03:20.576 --> 03:21.743
Those are the park people.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.454
Oh, yeah, said he wanted to help out.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.833
We fought Frank on those pills.
You shouldn't have to take those.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.711
And I told our ass of a father
if he ever forgets his keys

03:30.794 --> 03:34.089
or single lyric to a Steely Dan song,
I'm having him locked up for dementia.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.550
He's not welcome back in this house.
Not until you say so.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.801
Agreed.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.929
We all know that Frank
isn't the problem here.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.557
It's us. You and me.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.647
What you tried to do to me,
having me sent away…

03:52.566 --> 03:54.735
A lot of people wouldn't be able
to get past that.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.489
But I came here to help you,

04:00.616 --> 04:02.201
and that's what I'm going to do.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.287
Even if you don't want it.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.666
So I just need you to stop fighting me

04:09.750 --> 04:11.919
so that we can all go back
to being a family.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.173
I wanna start fresh.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.636
And you don't have to worry about me
being angry with you, Dorothy.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.346
Because I forgive you,

04:24.223 --> 04:25.891
and I will always forgive you.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.897
I pushed things too far.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.070
You were just trying to help.
I see that now.

04:41.532 --> 04:45.202
I'm sorry, Leanne. Won't happen again.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.584
I think a fresh start
sounds like a good idea.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.093
Come on, you can do it.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.594
Come on.

05:02.678 --> 05:05.514
You want your monkey?
You gotta crawl to it.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.226
You buying this?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.144
You're doing it.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.688
Yeah, me neither.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.190
-Good job.
-Good job.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.443
She's being smart. She's playing the game.
Keeping us out of it.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.153
I can see why she's being cautious.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.990
Dorothy only plays games
when she's already won in her head.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.159
Leanne's so innocent
'cause you're fucking her now?

05:26.243 --> 05:28.787
I just know Leanne
would never hurt Dorothy.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.164
She's harmless.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.833
Right.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.753
We should keep an eye on both of them.
In case this goes south.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.684
Do you wanna stop?

05:51.894 --> 05:54.771
Yes, maybe. You don't mind, do you?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.273
No, of course not.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.030
Let's do this again tomorrow though.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.282
I didn't realize how badly
my body needed it.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.035
Mine too.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.786
Should I take Jericho?

06:12.748 --> 06:14.917
Yes. That'd be good.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.005
Maybe I could get a little nap.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.050
Just don't let him crawl without me.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.469
Push him down if he tries.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.733
All the years we've been together,
do you know how many times

06:39.816 --> 06:41.944
you've apologized and meant it?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.779
I'm sorry, Sean. How many?

06:45.781 --> 06:48.742
Let me in on this.
Whatever it is you're planning.

06:48.825 --> 06:53.247
Planning? I'm just trying to be agreeable.
That's what you wanted.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.624
Come on, I know you.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.627
You're plotting something against us
so that when we least expect it, you can--

06:58.710 --> 06:59.795
I can what?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.674
What exactly can I do, Sean?

07:08.637 --> 07:11.807
When Dr. Mackenzie said
I was a danger to Jericho,

07:13.183 --> 07:14.726
I looked right in your eyes.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.397
You may not have wanted me to leave,

07:19.648 --> 07:21.984
but you did believe I could hurt our son.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.446
I'll never forget that.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.572
Did you hear something about Milo?

08:52.824 --> 08:53.825
I'm sorry.

08:54.952 --> 08:55.994
There's nothing.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.289
They did this to him.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.750
To hurt us.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.089
I will not suffer injustice.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.709
Do you believe her?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.672
When we were in middle school,

09:50.465 --> 09:53.468
Dottie punched this little asshole
called Kevin Parker.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.514
She got suspended for a week
and forced to write a letter of apology.

09:58.015 --> 10:01.560
Instead, she writes him a note saying
he deserved it for making fun of me.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.355
My sister isn't one to suffer injustice.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.321
I think it's time we put
the past behind us.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.589
Is everything okay, Sean?

11:15.717 --> 11:16.718
No.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.266
Did you have anything to do with Isabelle?

11:23.350 --> 11:24.935
I think you've had too much to drink.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.354
That's not an answer.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.232
Is it Dorothy?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.318
She's angry.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.779
I think she's gonna do something stupid.

11:38.115 --> 11:39.116
I see.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.326
Thank you for telling me.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.789
I don't know why it's so hard
for her to love us.

11:45.873 --> 11:49.334
Wait. If she does do something,
don't hurt her.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.713
You got to promise me.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.256
Is that why you're out here?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.093
You actually believe
that I would hurt Dorothy?

12:00.721 --> 12:01.805
Good night, Sean.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.169
Boop!

12:33.420 --> 12:36.381
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
It's almost 9:00.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.177
Is everything okay?

12:40.886 --> 12:42.137
Of course.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.265
I just thought maybe we could go
for a walk.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.353
Coffee's on the bedside.
I'll see you downstairs in a few.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.951
Yes.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.600
I wanted to bring you here
because I want you to see for yourself

13:28.684 --> 13:30.435
how safe you are with my friends.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.981
I tell them about you.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.612
About what you mean to me.
About what our family means.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.872
Eleven News is looking
for a new morning anchor.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.001
What?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.503
One of my friends found it
in the dumpster by the TV studio.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.715
Jannette Dash is retiring this summer.

14:02.509 --> 14:06.346
Dorothy, this could be
an amazing opportunity for you.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.350
You wouldn't have to be out in the field
reporting on things that are beneath you.

14:12.311 --> 14:14.146
The hours are steady.

14:14.229 --> 14:18.442
You could be home in time to have
dinner with Sean, put Jericho to sleep.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.570
It's everything that you have ever wanted.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.532
They won't have me.

14:25.616 --> 14:26.825
They might.

14:28.410 --> 14:33.040
I'm just trying to show you
that we're all on the same side.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.215
You're getting it in your eyes.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.011
Who's my clean little angel?

14:49.598 --> 14:50.682
Mama.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.477
Yes.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.646
Mama.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.981
That's me!

14:58.732 --> 15:00.192
I'm your mama.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.820
Your first word was "Mama."

15:06.698 --> 15:08.825
Mama. Mama.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.353
I dressed up nice, like you people asked.

15:37.688 --> 15:40.566
-Anyone gonna throw me a compliment?
-No time.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.109
Almost through here.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.444
Taste?

15:51.952 --> 15:52.995
That's amazing.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.289
Perfectly balanced.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.416
Where did you learn to make that?

15:57.958 --> 16:00.377
You made this for me the week we moved in.

16:02.296 --> 16:06.133
I didn't know you were watching.
What other secrets are you hiding?

16:14.683 --> 16:16.727
No. Absolutely not.

16:16.810 --> 16:17.811
Really? Now?

16:17.895 --> 16:19.563
-Why not?
-What is it?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.858
It's our mother's '78 Romanée-Conti.
It's fucking nectar ambrosia.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.485
Zeus himself is still sitting
on his bottles.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.738
Well, we're not Zeus.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.033
It's Tuesday. On a Tuesday, Dorothy?

16:31.116 --> 16:32.993
Tuesday never stopped Mom.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.622
And unless you plan on relapsing,
I don't think you have much of a say.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.707
That's not fair.
This isn't about my sobriety.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.167
This is about Mom.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.129
-As soon as we open that…
-She's gone.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.465
I know.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.509
That's why it's perfect.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.970
We could all use a fresh start.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.181
Right?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.768
One glass won't hurt.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.771
Said every alcoholic, ever.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.648
You've quit once. You can quit again.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.358
Trust me. I won't let you fall.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.194
Julian, you don't have to--

17:09.279 --> 17:10.989
I can do this. Open it.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.367
-Are you sure?
-We all knew I was gonna relapse anyway.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.872
Might as well be this glass.

17:19.665 --> 17:22.709
Okay. Well, then I'm getting the decanter
and the burgundy crystal.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.978
To mothers.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.147
And to new beginnings.

17:54.825 --> 17:55.993
What do you taste?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.124
Old fireworks.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.003
A barn in fall.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.673
Violets.

18:10.966 --> 18:11.967
Mom's favorite.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.430
Fuck.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.541
Dorothy?

18:46.335 --> 18:48.795
Let me speak, Sean.

18:56.929 --> 19:00.974
It's clear you and I haven't been
seeing things the same way.

19:01.058 --> 19:05.395
Sometimes I wonder if you even like
this life we've built together.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.898
Or if I somehow got it wrong. But…

19:10.817 --> 19:12.986
You have these beliefs now…

19:15.572 --> 19:17.115
that I just can't share.

19:19.868 --> 19:25.123
And I have been so angry with you
about it.

19:25.541 --> 19:26.875
I'm not anymore.

19:27.501 --> 19:28.836
You turned to faith.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.673
I turned to anger.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.716
I suppose that makes you more noble.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.891
I'm sorry.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.729
Dorothy.

19:48.272 --> 19:50.607
I'm so sorry too. I--

20:11.170 --> 20:12.588
It took me a while.

20:13.839 --> 20:15.257
But I got her to trust me.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.601
I'll be able to do what we need--

20:28.353 --> 20:31.857
Hush.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.321
Her story begins.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.574
It feeds on darkness.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.577
Grows stronger each night.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.289
Things are decaying.

20:48.749 --> 20:52.127
The house is filled with parasites.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.802
Do you smell the rot?

21:10.812 --> 21:12.523
What the hell happens now?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.317
The end.

22:48.202 --> 22:51.496
God, where's your Binky?
It was just right here.

23:04.218 --> 23:05.511
He's going to be cold in that.

23:11.016 --> 23:12.601
Get out of my way.

23:14.353 --> 23:15.771
Where will you go?

23:17.356 --> 23:19.024
Somewhere far from here.

23:19.942 --> 23:21.401
What will you do there?

23:23.862 --> 23:25.614
I'll start over.

23:26.365 --> 23:27.866
Can I come?

23:27.950 --> 23:29.076
No.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.079
Don't you get it? No!

23:32.829 --> 23:34.790
I'll follow you wherever you go.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.793
It doesn't matter how far.

23:37.876 --> 23:40.629
Leanne, you can have it all.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.172
It's yours.

23:42.256 --> 23:44.341
The house, my brother, my husband.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.093
Whatever you want. Take it.

23:46.176 --> 23:49.346
Please, just let me take
my child and leave.

23:50.848 --> 23:52.474
I'm doing this for you.

23:55.769 --> 23:58.021
Sean! Julian!

23:59.773 --> 24:01.942
What the fuck is going on?
Dorothy, why are you dressed?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.443
-Dorothy, stop!
-Give me Jericho.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.445
-No!
-Why don't we all just calm down?

24:05.529 --> 24:08.574
-Shut up, Julian! Move.
-Why do you want to leave me?

24:09.449 --> 24:11.076
I'm not your fucking mother.

24:12.119 --> 24:14.580
I'm not your friend. I am your boss.

24:14.663 --> 24:18.208
And you are just a sad and delusional girl
who needs help.

24:18.292 --> 24:21.253
And you somehow convinced
these two fucking idiots to believe you.

24:21.336 --> 24:23.213
Dorothy, why don't I hold him?

24:23.297 --> 24:26.550
Don't you dare look at me like that.
Not now.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.051
No. No one's looking at you any way.

24:28.135 --> 24:31.889
I will never let anything bad
happen to him. Never.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.640
I know. I know.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.602
I'm leaving now.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.689
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.653
No!

24:58.123 --> 25:01.543
Dorothy! Jesus! Julian!

25:02.127 --> 25:04.046
Fuck, fuck! Julian, dial 911!

25:04.129 --> 25:05.964
-Oh, shit! Shit!
-Hurry up! Now!

25:06.048 --> 25:07.341
I'm calling them!

25:07.424 --> 25:10.093
-Julian, do something!
-Give me a minute!

25:10.177 --> 25:11.428
Please, we need help!

25:11.512 --> 25:15.057
Dorothy! Dorothy!

25:15.140 --> 25:17.434
-I called an ambulance.
-Julian!
