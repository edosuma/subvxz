00:00.961 --> 00:02.629
<i>Previously on</i> iZombie...

00:02.837 --> 00:04.631
I want my life back, Ravi.
I eat brains.

00:04.839 --> 00:07.634
This is all we have.
One dose of the cure.
Two perhaps.

00:08.093 --> 00:09.302
<i>Zombies are real, Liv.</i>

00:09.511 --> 00:10.845
<i>I'm gonna kill 'em all.</i>

00:13.223 --> 00:15.016
I feed Seattle's zombies.

00:15.225 --> 00:17.102
Kill my crew, I'll make more.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.231
Make more now, bitch.

00:21.439 --> 00:22.524
<i>You turned me
into a zombie.</i>

00:22.732 --> 00:24.234
If it's what you
thought I wanted,

00:24.442 --> 00:26.361
then you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

00:28.655 --> 00:30.657
Whatever happens now,
I hope you can forgive me.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.909
<i>It looks like Suzuki
must've gone down swinging.</i>

00:33.118 --> 00:34.494
I need you to bring in
Major Lilywhite.

00:35.495 --> 00:37.998
Oh, my...

00:38.206 --> 00:39.624
<i>Your brother
has lost a lot of blood,</i>

00:39.833 --> 00:41.501
<i>and he's gonna need
more in order to survive.</i>

00:41.710 --> 00:43.003
- Liv is O-negative.
- Can you come with me,
Miss Moore?

00:43.211 --> 00:44.170
No.

00:49.634 --> 00:51.386
<i>Time heals all wounds.</i>

00:53.930 --> 00:57.350
<i>Time heals all wounds.</i>

01:08.737 --> 01:09.738
Hey, buddy.

01:13.158 --> 01:15.660
<i>Another surgery
to remove shrapnel.</i>

01:15.869 --> 01:18.246
<i>Three months, three surgeries.</i>

01:20.498 --> 01:22.167
You need to leave.

01:22.375 --> 01:24.044
Right now.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.588
Please, Mom. Let me be here
when Evan wakes up.

01:26.755 --> 01:27.922
It kills me
that he thinks I...

01:28.131 --> 01:29.174
You were gonna let him die?

01:31.176 --> 01:33.636
If Dr. Long hadn't been
on duty...

01:33.845 --> 01:35.805
If he hadn't shared
your blood type...

01:37.724 --> 01:40.852
Your brother has gotten
your texts, your emails,
your voicemails.

01:41.061 --> 01:42.520
If he wanted to see you,
you would know.

01:44.147 --> 01:46.399
It's drugs, isn't it?

01:46.608 --> 01:47.901
No. I'm not on drugs.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.277
What, then?

01:49.486 --> 01:51.696
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

01:51.905 --> 01:53.865
You'd try to
have me committed,

01:54.074 --> 01:57.911
or you'd try to fix things
in ways that would only
make it all worse.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.621
You'd put us all in danger.

02:01.915 --> 02:03.208
Liv.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.380
Hey.

02:10.381 --> 02:11.508
I'm here.

02:15.220 --> 02:16.262
Go away.

02:19.057 --> 02:20.809
Don't come back.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.732
<i>I couldn't have
given Evan my blood</i>

02:27.941 --> 02:30.902
<i>even if I had been willing
to turn him into a zombie.</i>

02:31.111 --> 02:33.905
<i>The second some nurse
took my pulse,
took my temperature,</i>

02:34.114 --> 02:36.157
<i>they would've quarantined me.</i>

02:36.366 --> 02:39.744
<i>Maybe it's better
I'm radioactive, that I repel
the people I love.</i>

02:39.953 --> 02:41.412
<i>Keeps things simple.</i>

02:41.621 --> 02:44.916
<i>Harden yourself, Liv.
You're a monster.</i>

02:45.125 --> 02:46.918
<i>Act like one.</i>

03:13.611 --> 03:16.614
If I'd said,
"Yeah, Mom, heroin.
You're right.

03:16.823 --> 03:19.033
"I'm riding the white horse,
chasing the dragon,"

03:19.242 --> 03:21.035
she'd have put me
through hell,
but she'd forgive me.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.745
You can't give up
on your family, Liv.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.747
- Or Peyton.
- And Major?

03:24.956 --> 03:26.708
- Thought so.
- Or Major.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.960
He just...

03:29.169 --> 03:31.254
He hasn't been himself.
Helton Shelter won't give
him a good reference.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.298
He can't find a job
that gives his life
any meaning.

03:33.506 --> 03:35.049
Well, he forgave you.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.844
That's just a simple case
of bros before... Ex-fiances.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.436
But it would be wrong to say
I'm completely forgiven.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.937
Things are still...

03:48.146 --> 03:49.939
Watch out for the blood.

03:50.148 --> 03:52.025
This is why I pay someone
to fix my car.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.638
Victim was
Wendell Gordon Gale, 77.

04:21.846 --> 04:24.766
He died at 10:32 p.m.
Several people heard
the victim scream.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.851
And we're sure it's a murder?

04:27.060 --> 04:29.479
Well, CSI guy says
the jack is fully functional.
It didn't fail.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.189
Someone had to
kick the release.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.233
Check out this print.
Wafflestomper.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.567
The killer stood there
watching long enough

04:34.776 --> 04:36.027
for the blood
to reach his feet.

04:36.236 --> 04:37.820
He must've enjoyed
watching him die.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.697
Or he was in shock.

04:39.906 --> 04:41.032
Well, either way,
he made his way over
to the basement.

04:41.241 --> 04:42.992
Did you see that?

04:43.201 --> 04:45.370
The killer might've been
on a bike.

04:45.578 --> 04:46.746
Or a medical scooter.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.250
Are you the detective
in charge?

04:50.458 --> 04:51.876
Yes, ma'am.

04:52.085 --> 04:53.461
One of the officers said
you wanted to talk to me.

04:53.628 --> 04:55.672
I discovered the body.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.048
Wendell was my brother-in-law,

04:57.257 --> 04:58.675
my late husband's
older brother.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.176
Do you know anyone who
might've wanted to kill him?

05:00.385 --> 05:02.095
Honestly, Detective.
I'd be hard-pressed

05:02.303 --> 05:04.097
to think of anyone
in a three-mile radius

05:04.305 --> 05:07.225
whose day isn't brightened
by the news that he's gone.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.018
Not particularly
well-liked, huh?

05:09.227 --> 05:10.561
Well...

05:10.770 --> 05:13.314
Once upon a time,
Wendell was a decent fellow.

05:13.523 --> 05:15.733
But he's been a cantankerous
son of a bitch

05:15.942 --> 05:17.735
for the past 30 years,
give or take.

05:17.944 --> 05:19.320
You name it, he hates it.

05:19.529 --> 05:21.948
The laughter of children,
puppies,

05:22.156 --> 05:23.700
other races, his own race,

05:23.908 --> 05:25.702
trick-or-treaters,
Christmas carolers.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.287
What happened 30 years ago?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.914
Well, that's when
the fibromyalgia set in.

05:30.123 --> 05:33.251
He went on disability,
became embittered.

05:33.459 --> 05:35.586
His wife left him,
took the two kids with her.

05:35.795 --> 05:37.588
What was your relationship
like with your brother-in-law?

05:37.797 --> 05:39.382
I took pity on him.

05:51.811 --> 05:53.604
Have you noticed that
Final Hope hates me?

05:53.813 --> 05:56.274
Her name is New Hope,
not Final Hope.

05:56.482 --> 05:57.859
You know this.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.485
If I wanted to give her
a depressing name,

05:59.694 --> 06:01.863
I would've gone
with Phantom Menace.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.657
And she doesn't hate you.
She just feels like

06:04.866 --> 06:06.993
you don't put enough
energy into the relationship.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.828
And she is not gonna
let herself be a bit player

06:09.037 --> 06:10.288
in your grand drama.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.124
At least that's what
she insinuated to me.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.085
Sorry, New Hope.
I can't be trusted
with secrets.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.129
I am serious about this.

06:19.839 --> 06:21.174
I think someone's
feeling sorry for herself.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.343
- Who, me? Or...
- Oh, you.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.720
Well, I do feel
sorry for myself.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.598
But that doesn't mean that
I'm wrong about Final Hope.

06:28.806 --> 06:31.726
She looks traumatized
every time I get close
to her cage.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.103
Well, maybe it's
the cannibalism.

06:34.312 --> 06:36.230
- She is squeamish.
- Great.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.149
I'm grossing out a rat.

06:38.358 --> 06:39.525
That's it.

06:39.734 --> 06:42.820
I am throwing in the towel.
I am done.

06:43.029 --> 06:45.990
Until I'm human again,
no more interpersonal
relationships.

06:46.199 --> 06:47.950
I am all business.

06:48.159 --> 06:49.827
I'm one of the
Riders of the Apocalypse,

06:50.036 --> 06:52.789
leaving pestilence and
misery in my wake.

06:52.997 --> 06:54.999
I take it drinks with the
new roommate didn't go well.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.542
It was fine.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.336
She's fine.

06:58.544 --> 07:01.172
It's not like I'm gonna find
another Peyton on Craigslist.

07:01.381 --> 07:04.008
I mean, the girl works for
the IRS, for crying out loud.

07:04.217 --> 07:07.428
Well, if you're going
to be pathetic until
you're human again,

07:07.637 --> 07:10.056
I suppose we should try
to make that happen.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.682
Now, let me see...

07:11.891 --> 07:14.394
What do I need to
replicate the cure?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.729
Hmm... Ah, yes.

07:16.938 --> 07:18.648
Utopium from the night
of the boat massacre.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.525
The tainted stuff.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.820
I remember having
a limited supply...

07:24.028 --> 07:26.739
I remember asking you
not to use up the last bit...

07:26.948 --> 07:28.241
Whatever happened to that?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.284
Passive aggressive
is not a good look on you.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.870
Three months of trying
to recreate it has
gotten me nowhere.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.705
I mean, the cure wasn't even
properly tested.

07:34.914 --> 07:36.874
What if it wears off?
What if Major grows horns?

07:37.083 --> 07:39.043
How many times
can I say "I'm sorry"?

07:39.252 --> 07:41.921
- Well, one more would be good.
- I'm sorry.

07:42.130 --> 07:44.048
All right, then.

07:44.257 --> 07:47.385
But would we prefer
that Blaine was out there
making more zombies?

07:47.593 --> 07:51.389
That's why I gave him
the cure, to make sure that,
that couldn't happen.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.767
Plus, I got the distinct
impression that Major would've
put a shotgun in his mouth

07:54.976 --> 07:56.352
before he'd eat brains.

07:56.561 --> 07:58.729
Okay, so,
in the grand scheme,

07:58.938 --> 08:01.566
maybe it was
a little short-sighted.

08:01.774 --> 08:02.942
Let's find that Utopium.

08:03.151 --> 08:04.444
Where do we start?

08:04.652 --> 08:06.112
- Blaine.
- Of course.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.823
All roads lead to
your new mortal enemy.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.450
And where might he be?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.368
Who the hell knows?

08:12.577 --> 08:13.828
Death.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.997
I can't sugarcoat it.
This won't be easy.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.916
But I'm here
to make the process...
What's the word?

08:19.125 --> 08:20.209
Palatable.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.003
It's what I do.

08:22.170 --> 08:24.589
You'd be hard-pressed to find
anyone with more experience.

08:24.797 --> 08:26.257
I'll bet ever since
you got the news,

08:26.466 --> 08:28.593
you've been walking around
like a zombie, am I right?

08:28.801 --> 08:31.429
Yeah. I thought so.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.806
Just know this.

08:34.015 --> 08:36.684
My number-one priority
is your peace of mind.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.145
I never stop
thinking about it.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.771
So,

08:40.980 --> 08:43.232
let's take this
journey together.

08:43.441 --> 08:44.859
What do you say? Hmm?

08:54.952 --> 08:56.537
- Lieutenant Suzuki
died a hero.

08:56.746 --> 08:58.664
In recognition of his heroism,

08:58.873 --> 09:01.375
he has been awarded
the Seattle Police Department
Medal of Honor.

09:06.005 --> 09:10.218
How many more people might
have died had your husband
not waded into a firefight

09:10.426 --> 09:14.263
and dispatched members
of a drug ring responsible
for so many deaths?

09:19.727 --> 09:21.854
<i>With the German Army
focused on Patton</i>

09:22.063 --> 09:23.689
<i>the main force bided its time</i>

09:23.898 --> 09:26.484
<i>waiting for better weather.</i>

09:28.694 --> 09:29.612
Liv.

09:34.367 --> 09:35.993
Liv!

09:36.869 --> 09:38.287
What, already?

09:38.496 --> 09:39.830
Late night?

09:40.039 --> 09:42.166
Suddenly you're Matlock?

09:42.375 --> 09:44.961
Neighbor of the deceased
called the tip line, left an
unintelligible message.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.379
I was gonna run it down.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.423
Any visions yet?

09:49.632 --> 09:52.260
Yeah. I got a vision of you
leaving me the hell alone,
so I can catch some shut-eye.

09:53.803 --> 09:55.763
Fine. I'll handle this solo.

09:55.972 --> 09:58.391
You take care
of that hangover.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.393
Oh, brush the sand
out of your crack and relax.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.812
I'm just busting
your chops, flatfoot.

10:05.982 --> 10:08.401
Turn your hat around, punk.
Show some respect!

10:09.277 --> 10:10.945
What?

10:11.153 --> 10:14.198
Is he crouching
behind home plate
at Yankee Stadium?

10:14.407 --> 10:16.242
Captain came down
to Homicide today,

10:16.450 --> 10:18.786
presented Suzuki's widow
with the Medal of Honor.

10:18.953 --> 10:21.414
- He deserved it.
- Did he?

10:23.457 --> 10:25.876
So you and Major are
back together, huh?

10:26.085 --> 10:28.296
- How's that going?
- What? No. We're not together.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.631
We're the opposite
of together.
What makes you say that?

10:30.840 --> 10:32.800
Well, you're his alibi
for the Meat Cute murders.

10:33.009 --> 10:34.468
He spent the night
at my place.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.012
Must be how
I got the impression
you were back together.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.431
We talked about this.
He was on the couch.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.142
He just had a few
sleepless nights after he got
out of the mental hospital.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.269
- He didn't like being alone.
- So at the time
of the shooting,

10:43.477 --> 10:44.937
you were in your room,
he was on the couch.

10:45.146 --> 10:47.023
- You're sure he couldn't
have snuck out?
- I'm sure.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.817
We talked most of the night,
and he passed
the gun residue test.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.944
No one could find him
for 24 hours.

10:52.153 --> 10:54.655
He could've scrubbed
his clothes clean.
It just doesn't add up, Liv.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.991
The wound in Suzuki's thigh
looked self-inflicted.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.410
Julien, the guy Major claimed
was murdering his kids,

10:59.619 --> 11:01.454
the one Major said
he shot three times?

11:01.662 --> 11:03.497
Was one of the victims.

11:03.706 --> 11:06.709
The teenager found
in the deep freeze
was a Helton Shelter kid.

11:08.002 --> 11:09.545
It's a closed case, isn't it?

11:09.754 --> 11:12.340
Someone was satisfied
with the investigation.

11:12.548 --> 11:14.967
We do love making
one of our own a hero.

11:18.429 --> 11:19.513
Hello?

11:19.722 --> 11:20.681
Byron Thistlewaite?

11:20.890 --> 11:22.933
Yeah.

11:23.142 --> 11:25.686
I'm Detective Clive Babineaux,
and this is medical examiner
Olivia Moore.

11:25.895 --> 11:28.606
You left a message on
the SPD tipster hotline.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.859
Yeah, isn't that hotline
for anonymous tips?

11:32.068 --> 11:33.861
We don't claim it's anonymous.

11:34.028 --> 11:37.573
The implication, though.
I didn't leave
my name or number.

11:37.782 --> 11:40.284
- How'd you even find me?
- We sprung for caller ID.

11:40.493 --> 11:42.536
Thought it might come in
handy for solving murders
and whatnot.

11:43.496 --> 11:45.289
"T-shirts are passe"?

11:45.498 --> 11:48.000
I don't get it.
You're wearing a T-shirt.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.294
It's meant to be ironic.

11:50.503 --> 11:51.379
It's a joke.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.589
Good one.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.174
Your T-shirt's stupid.

11:55.383 --> 11:57.259
That's meant to be literal.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.428
<i>Hi, I'm willing to report
an accident.</i>

11:59.637 --> 12:01.889
<i>These punks have been
hitting my neighbor's house
with eggs.</i>

12:02.098 --> 12:04.517
<i>And, um...
Yeah, I'm pretty sure...</i>

12:04.725 --> 12:08.062
Something about eggs
and somebody threatening
somebody?

12:08.270 --> 12:12.149
Listen, I wanted to do
my civic duty, but I don't
wanna get involved.

12:12.358 --> 12:14.026
Why?

12:15.444 --> 12:17.988
This... This kid,

12:18.197 --> 12:20.741
he's, like, the terror
of the neighborhood.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.076
What kid?

12:22.284 --> 12:24.370
Rodney Ricks.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.874
Okay, he's from
a couple blocks over.
He's a real thug.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.043
He's a teenager. Not a bear.

12:31.252 --> 12:34.964
Pretend you got a pair
and speak up, son.

12:35.172 --> 12:39.260
The other night,
I hear some commotion, and
I look out across the street,

12:39.468 --> 12:44.557
and Rodney and a few of
his homies are egging
Wendell's house.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.309
And Wendell comes
charging out and he tases him.

12:47.518 --> 12:51.856
Rodney drops like a rock,
and Wendell just starts
kicking the hell out of him.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.816
And finally, when Rodney
gets up, he's shouting,

12:54.024 --> 12:58.988
"I'm gonna bleep you up,
old man."

12:59.196 --> 13:00.698
Where were you standing
when you heard all this?

13:03.409 --> 13:05.578
You could make out
what they were saying
all the way from here?

13:05.786 --> 13:08.414
All the shouted bits, yeah.
I had the window open.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.751
You do all these
paint by numbers, or you have
a slow nephew or something?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.544
No, I found them at a gallery.

13:13.753 --> 13:15.212
Were they in the garbage?

13:19.175 --> 13:21.177
Sorry.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.971
I would've been back sooner,
but we got stuck behind
an Asian driver.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.848
Hey, Archie Bunker,

13:26.056 --> 13:27.850
- I'm of Asian descent.
- Great.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.852
Explain to your people
how turn signals work.

13:32.188 --> 13:34.899
Mind prepping drawer six
for transfer?

13:35.107 --> 13:37.318
"Body going to Shady Plots."
New funeral home?

13:37.485 --> 13:38.986
Uh, change of ownership.

13:39.153 --> 13:43.657
Says here the new owner
is John Deaux.
That's D-E-A-U-X.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.660
It's a known alias for
my least favorite of
our cured zombies.

14:02.343 --> 14:04.094
Oh, the humanity.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.765
You see anything you like?

14:07.973 --> 14:10.434
It's so rare the dead
get to choose.

14:10.643 --> 14:12.144
I got one with a breakaway lid

14:12.353 --> 14:14.730
that's a real time-saver
for today's zombie
looking to make

14:14.939 --> 14:19.527
that classic hand-shooting-up-
through-the-dirt
big entrance.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.906
I don't mind admitting
you were an inspiration
behind this venture.

14:24.114 --> 14:28.202
Letting the brains
come to you.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.080
Fortunately my previous
enterprise provided me
enough startup capital

14:31.288 --> 14:32.540
I needed to diversify.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.875
And Seattle's zombie
population feeds off

14:35.084 --> 14:37.711
already-deceased people,
as God intended.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.549
How low must the bar be
for me to be able to say,
with some sincerity,

14:41.757 --> 14:42.758
that I am proud of you?

14:44.552 --> 14:46.554
- Chocolate?
- Rain check.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.431
Oh, forgot.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.350
Taste buds as kaputski
as the rest of you.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.397
Ah... Mmm.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.108
Are you eating that
or impregnating it?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.152
I'm curious.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.905
Why?

15:05.114 --> 15:06.824
Why are you still suiting
up for Team Z?

15:07.741 --> 15:09.201
The uniform sucks.

15:09.410 --> 15:13.789
Morale is, let's be honest,
consistently low.

15:13.998 --> 15:16.667
Don't tell me you've actually
developed a taste for brains.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.130
Hold the phone! You dig it.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.300
You get off on being the hero,
don't you?

15:24.508 --> 15:26.343
Oh, would you...
Would you look at that.

15:26.552 --> 15:29.346
That's a... That's a
crime-solving zombie.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.433
Roger, get in here!
She's a... She's a credit
to her species.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.560
Why can't they all
be like her?

15:34.768 --> 15:36.353
This isn't by choice.

15:36.562 --> 15:38.147
So you gave
all the cure to me,

15:38.355 --> 15:40.274
and you can't make more?

15:40.482 --> 15:42.943
That must
stick in your craw.

15:44.612 --> 15:46.405
Did you get a look
at the place?

15:46.614 --> 15:47.740
Did you?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.033
Come on.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.619
Check it out.

15:51.827 --> 15:53.495
Viewing and services
in the chapel there,

15:53.704 --> 15:55.122
refreshments served here.

15:55.331 --> 15:58.500
Embalming and
brain-harvesting
in the basement.

15:58.709 --> 16:01.211
It's got great flow,
don't you think?

16:01.420 --> 16:03.422
I've been meaning to ask you.

16:03.631 --> 16:04.924
After our last encounter,

16:05.132 --> 16:08.218
you might recall it as
the night you shot me,

16:08.427 --> 16:11.013
I was watching the coverage
of the gunfight
at the Meat Cute corral,

16:11.221 --> 16:13.057
and guess what I didn't see?

16:13.265 --> 16:15.142
Your boyfriend's name
among the deceased.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.645
Now, I'm no medical examiner,
but when I left,

16:17.853 --> 16:21.106
I would've have put
dollars to donuts that
Dudley Do-Right was a goner.

16:21.315 --> 16:22.942
Which could only mean
one thing.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.069
Somewhere out there,

16:25.277 --> 16:28.280
Major Lilywhite,
the most presciently named
zombie of all time,

16:28.489 --> 16:31.283
- roams the Earth.
- Whitey Shamblemoore
begs to differ.

16:31.492 --> 16:33.452
Well, next time
you see your beau,

16:33.661 --> 16:35.287
remind him he owes me
a million dollars

16:35.496 --> 16:39.708
and a whole deli's worth
of imported meat-slicing
appliances.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.503
The night of the boat party,
you were selling Utopium.

16:42.670 --> 16:46.173
But it wasn't pure.
It was cut with something.

16:46.382 --> 16:48.342
We need more of it
if we're gonna make
more of the cure.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.843
Mmm-hmm.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.679
And why would I want to help?

16:51.887 --> 16:54.139
I'm human.
I've got a thriving business.

16:54.348 --> 16:56.684
I just learned
I've been pre-approved
for a Best Buy card.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.394
I've gone legit.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.689
Put my criminal ways
behind me.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.441
We're not sure
your cure is permanent.

17:06.360 --> 17:09.780
The first batch killed the
test rat inside of two days.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.075
And which batch
did you shoot me up with?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.869
The second.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.163
So let me appeal
to your self-interest.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.626
You're likely on borrowed
time, and if we don't get
that tainted Utopium,

17:22.835 --> 17:27.172
you may wake up finding
yourself with a hankering
for some of the pink stuff.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.800
Shipment just arrived.

17:30.009 --> 17:31.343
Mmm-hmm.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.888
Tell you what, Liv Moore,

17:35.097 --> 17:38.058
I'll make some inquiries
about that special
boat-night Utopium.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.352
Inquire like your life
depends on it.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.484
Oh, and you can save your
respectable businessman
jiggery-pokery

17:47.693 --> 17:49.194
for someone who might buy it.

17:49.403 --> 17:52.072
Hand to God.
Your boyfriend
scared me straight.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.782
I'm a changed man.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.993
You'll see.
I'll earn your trust.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.579
We should go out some night,
bust some criminals' skulls.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.670
Gentlemen.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.839
Let's take a look
at this bad boy.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.305
Who's gonna rule Seattle?

18:17.139 --> 18:18.766
We are.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.935
One hundred percent
pure and uncut.

18:43.665 --> 18:44.917
I'm gonna come clean
with you, Major.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.960
I'm an emotional eater,
and last night,

18:47.169 --> 18:49.463
I was feeling all
stuffed-crust pepperoni.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.799
I'm your trainer, Bill,
not your priest.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.050
Ready to work?

19:00.432 --> 19:02.768
Two, three, four,

19:02.976 --> 19:06.438
five, six, seven...

19:22.746 --> 19:24.331
You're determined.
I'll give you that.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.291
I get it.
You're not talking to me.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.585
Look, I told you.
I just need some time.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.504
This isn't a social call.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.215
And it's not a message
you'd want recorded
for posterity.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.467
- Yeah?
- It's Clive.

19:35.676 --> 19:38.137
He's grilling me about
your Meat Cute alibi.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.848
He's like a dog with a bone.
Those five dead henchmen?

19:41.056 --> 19:42.891
<i>He suspects you killed them.</i>

19:45.269 --> 19:47.479
Where've you been?

19:47.688 --> 19:50.482
They brought in
that Rodney Ricks kid
who killed Wendell.

19:51.692 --> 19:52.693
He did it?

19:52.860 --> 19:54.153
- You had a vision?
- No!

19:54.361 --> 19:56.947
Good God, Lemon, patience!

19:57.156 --> 19:59.074
That kid screams guilty.
He's wearing makeup,

19:59.283 --> 20:02.744
and his pants are
hanging so low, they look like
a bra for his ass.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.497
Obama.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.711
So, I went to see
your brother this morning.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.713
You did? Why?

20:12.880 --> 20:15.299
I took your favorite
police sketch artist, Jimmy,
to see him.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.844
Had Evan describe the man
who hired him at Meat Cute.

20:20.137 --> 20:23.056
This is what
Jimmy came up with.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.643
Now I worked with
the sketch artist at
the 48th Precinct last month,

20:26.852 --> 20:30.105
described the man
I met at Meat Cute
on that decapitation case.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.316
Here's my sketch.

20:34.443 --> 20:38.071
There was a name
written in Suzuki's own blood
at Meat Cute.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.199
Blaine.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.577
I think this is our Blaine.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.537
You ever see him?

20:45.746 --> 20:46.914
Maybe with Major?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.457
Nope.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.085
I'm warning you, son.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.213
A bunch of good men didn't
die face-down in the muck

20:54.421 --> 20:56.840
so you could paint your face
like a $2 whore.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.717
I think what
she means to say is,

20:58.926 --> 21:01.428
did you or did you not
threaten Mr. Gale?

21:01.637 --> 21:05.182
That douche
from across the street went
running to the cops, huh?

21:05.390 --> 21:07.267
He tell you
the old son of a bitch
tased me?

21:07.476 --> 21:10.562
So, you have motive
and no alibi.

21:10.771 --> 21:13.106
You know who you
should be going after?

21:13.315 --> 21:15.525
- Who?
- Squirrels.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.446
Talk about motive.
He hates 'em for
getting into his bird feeders.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.950
We thought it'd be hilarious
to toss bags of
sunflower seeds into his yard

21:23.158 --> 21:24.701
every time we went by.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.955
After a while, his place was
just overrun with squirrels.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.123
Then, one day, poof!

21:30.332 --> 21:32.542
They're all dead.
Like, a hundred of them.

21:32.751 --> 21:35.295
He poisoned 'em,
stacked 'em up like firewood,
and burned 'em.

21:37.256 --> 21:38.548
Who does that?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.175
Would you mind putting your
foot up on the table?

21:45.764 --> 21:47.307
You know,
if we were in Baghdad,

21:47.516 --> 21:48.767
this would be like me
flipping you off.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.853
Should I put the other one
up here, too?

21:52.062 --> 21:54.106
Does this look like
your gynecologist's office?

21:58.902 --> 22:01.071
Haven't you heard?
That stuff'll rot your brain.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.115
I think we're too late.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.284
Ah.

22:05.492 --> 22:08.662
<i>"Max Rager, Minimum Return."</i>

22:08.870 --> 22:11.331
<i>That was the headline
in the</i> Journal <i>yesterday.</i>

22:11.540 --> 22:13.333
<i>I'm sure you saw it.</i>

22:13.542 --> 22:14.793
Yesterday?

22:15.002 --> 22:16.837
Yesterday

22:17.045 --> 22:20.507
I biked up Buck Mountain,
sailed back down
in a hang glider.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.342
I had my breakfast,

22:22.551 --> 22:24.428
made love to my companion,

22:24.636 --> 22:26.346
sent her on her way.

22:26.555 --> 22:30.142
Then I took my
Asian investors ballooning
in wine country,

22:30.350 --> 22:32.728
I secured a deal which
opened up Vietnam and Laos,

22:32.936 --> 22:35.022
then I jetted back home
where I accepted...

22:36.690 --> 22:39.026
...a Chamber of Commerce
innovator award.

22:39.234 --> 22:41.862
Gee, I guess I must've
missed the <i>Journal</i> headline.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.947
Why don't you email it to me?

22:44.156 --> 22:45.032
<i>No one
on the board doubts
your commitment to</i>

22:45.240 --> 22:47.492
<i>being the face of the company.</i>

22:47.701 --> 22:50.037
<i>Since the article
detailing how Max Rager
consumers have experienced</i>

22:50.245 --> 22:51.413
<i>manic, violent episodes,</i>

22:51.621 --> 22:52.956
<i>sales have dropped 30%.</i>

22:53.165 --> 22:54.833
<i>And, of course,
there are the lawsuits.</i>

22:55.042 --> 22:56.335
Last year, we did sales of...

22:56.543 --> 22:57.669
Seven point eight.

22:57.878 --> 23:00.297
Eight b-b-billion dollars.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.550
I'm more than the face,
and I hope you and the board
don't forget that.

23:03.759 --> 23:06.261
And when Super Max
hits the market, well...

23:06.470 --> 23:09.306
<i>You've been
promising us Super Max
for a year, Vaughn.</i>

23:09.514 --> 23:12.225
<i>And can you guarantee
Super Max won't have
the same side effects</i>

23:12.434 --> 23:14.353
<i>that plagued Max Rager?</i>

23:14.561 --> 23:18.732
Well, I can guarantee that
we will all be so wealthy,
we won't care.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.362
Lighten up, people.
Lighten up.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.281
I am
Mr. Social Responsibility.

23:26.490 --> 23:28.617
Our best and brightest
are on it.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.452
And as always,

23:30.660 --> 23:35.749
your encouragement and advice
are valued and taken to heart.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.501
So, one love,

23:37.709 --> 23:38.752
sayonara,

23:38.960 --> 23:41.338
<i>hasta pronto.</i>

23:41.546 --> 23:44.674
Remind me again why
we can't put all of them
into the company plane

23:44.883 --> 23:46.843
and fly it right into
a volcano?

23:49.930 --> 23:52.057
We need their money.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.143
Once Super Max hits shelves,
you'll be untouchable.

23:55.352 --> 23:58.188
Assuming we're not
mid-zombie apocalypse.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.689
That's not gonna happen.

23:59.898 --> 24:03.735
- Oh?
- Our surveillance
has paid off.

24:03.944 --> 24:06.863
- We've solved
the zombie problem.
- And how's that?

24:07.072 --> 24:09.366
We've located the instrument
of their destruction.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.078
Is that my cue to start
cackling maniacally,

24:13.286 --> 24:16.289
or shall I wait for you
provide the details?

24:27.467 --> 24:29.302
Hi. I'm here for Mr. Addis.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.055
The new trainer.
Yeah, come in.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.891
You know, my dad's not fat,
but his job is killing him.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.437
High stress,
and he refuses to get his
blood pressure checked.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.647
I mean, I keep bugging him
to start working out,

24:40.856 --> 24:42.732
but he's a heart attack
waiting to happen.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.819
That's Kyle.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.821
- He won't notice you unless
you're a zombie he can kill.

24:48.029 --> 24:50.740
Hey, Dad! Your trainer's here.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.535
No pressure,
but we're counting on you
to save his life.

24:53.743 --> 24:54.953
No pressure.

25:02.419 --> 25:03.545
Hey there.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.714
Is it too soon to start
begging for mercy?

25:20.353 --> 25:23.023
That, uh, chin-up contest
you talked about?

25:23.190 --> 25:24.649
Yeah, it's on. Right now.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.319
You go first.

25:28.445 --> 25:30.322
So, listen, uh...

25:30.530 --> 25:33.366
Look, I know you've not been
in a great head space
these days,

25:33.575 --> 25:36.077
but I wanted to talk to you
about the house, generally.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.330
The kitchen, specifically.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.041
The goop in the sink?
It's developed consciousness
and opposable thumbs.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.793
So I showed up to train
a new client today,

25:44.002 --> 25:44.961
and he was a zombie.

25:47.005 --> 25:48.965
What, like,
blonde hair, pale skin?

25:49.174 --> 25:50.342
No.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.843
- He was normal-looking.
- So how did you know?

25:52.052 --> 25:54.387
I... Look, I can't explain it,
all right,

25:54.596 --> 25:55.847
but I knew.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.725
My hair stood on end,
my pulse was racing.

25:58.934 --> 26:01.394
Like a wild animal's fear
instinct telling you to run.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.896
Look, I've experienced it
once before.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.564
With Liv.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.441
No, I was in a crowd.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.568
Liv, uh, doesn't seem
to set it off.

26:09.236 --> 26:11.071
Huh...

26:11.279 --> 26:13.198
Because she domesticated you.

26:13.406 --> 26:16.284
Like a lap dog or a pigeon
that would eat crumbs
out of your hand.

26:18.662 --> 26:20.038
Why don't I take care
of them dishes?

26:23.667 --> 26:24.584
Hey, what's up, pale beauty?

26:24.793 --> 26:26.753
Dream on, Tupac. Pfft.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.255
Oh, it's like that?

26:28.463 --> 26:29.631
You rang?

26:29.839 --> 26:31.925
So, three days before
Wendell Gale was killed,

26:32.133 --> 26:34.010
he filed an insurance claim.

26:34.219 --> 26:37.264
Someone apparently
keyed his car to the
tune of $1,300 in damages.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.349
Rodney Ricks?
Sounds like something

26:39.558 --> 26:41.851
- that kid would do.
- I know you feelin' me, girl,
stop playin'.

26:42.060 --> 26:44.312
Yeah, my thoughts, too.

26:44.521 --> 26:48.108
None of Rodney's shoes matched
our wafflestomper print,
but he could've ditched 'em.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.443
- You wanna go pay him a visit?
- Hey, snowflake.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.572
You look like you could use
a little color in you,
you know what I'm saying?

26:53.780 --> 26:55.615
Sir.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.325
Unless you wanna
spend the night in a cell

26:57.534 --> 26:59.786
with the Aryan Knights
of the New Confederacy,

26:59.953 --> 27:00.996
you're gonna need to zip it.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.208
Thanks, Clive.
You're one of the good ones.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.801
I'm gonna go get myself
a coffee and try very hard
to forget you said that.

27:14.968 --> 27:15.927
What?

27:17.637 --> 27:19.055
Oh, it was a compliment.

27:24.352 --> 27:25.895
Enjoying your day off?

27:26.104 --> 27:28.064
I think we've discovered
a new side effect of the cure.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.317
- Yeah?
- Well, more than once now,

27:30.525 --> 27:33.320
Major's run into people and
he's just utterly convinced
they're zombies.

27:33.528 --> 27:35.947
His heart starts racing,
his hair stands on end.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.033
He's a human zombie detector.

27:38.241 --> 27:41.828
So New Hope has had the cure.
That's why she runs away
from me.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.788
My thoughts exactly.

27:43.997 --> 27:46.124
Then that stands to
reason that all of
the patients who...

27:49.002 --> 27:51.463
Oh, for God's sake.

27:51.671 --> 27:52.964
Now, you listen here,
young lady.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.091
I have had it
with your shenanigans.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.012
You stubborn,
mean-spirited bastard.

27:59.220 --> 28:03.516
Think I can sell my place,
when I'm living next to this
hell hole?

28:03.725 --> 28:06.728
You sleep with one eye open,
Wendell.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.356
No, no!

28:09.564 --> 28:13.693
No, not my car!
Get back here, you old hag!

28:13.902 --> 28:16.404
...your sense of entitlement,
your complete lack
of manners...

28:16.613 --> 28:20.200
Did they find the guy
who did that to your hair,
or is he still at large?

28:20.408 --> 28:21.951
Jimmy. Jimmy.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.120
Hey, never mind her.

28:24.329 --> 28:26.373
There are some bear claws
in the break room.
Why don't you take mine?

28:26.581 --> 28:27.791
I'm taking hers, too.

28:27.999 --> 28:30.835
- Oh, you'll lose a hand.
- I'm not scared of you!

28:31.044 --> 28:32.545
What's your deal?

28:32.754 --> 28:34.172
Do you need some aspirin?

28:34.381 --> 28:35.507
Like, some lady aspirin?

28:35.715 --> 28:37.509
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry, it's just...

28:37.717 --> 28:39.010
I had a vision.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.680
It wasn't Rodney
who keyed Wendell's car.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.723
It was Wendell's
sister-in-law, Clara.

28:43.932 --> 28:48.269
She can't sell her house
because Wendell's place
is like Little Calcutta.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.855
She told him to
"sleep with one eye open."

28:51.064 --> 28:52.732
She's in one of those
wheelchair things.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.234
How's she gonna kick
out the jack?

28:54.442 --> 28:55.819
In my vision, she was jogging.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.408
Open up.

29:01.616 --> 29:04.744
I'm here on business.
I can hear you
moving around in there.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.914
I was sorry to hear
about your brother.

29:08.123 --> 29:11.167
I wanted to be at the funeral,
but, you know. Things came up.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.254
Look, I need to talk to you
about the night of
the boat party.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.297
Someone cut the
Utopium that night.

29:16.506 --> 29:18.842
It was you, right?
You and your twin?

29:19.050 --> 29:22.637
There's a payday. A big one.

29:22.846 --> 29:25.807
For whoever can show me
how it was done.

29:26.015 --> 29:27.517
Don't make me
huff and puff, man.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.274
Don E.

29:36.192 --> 29:37.527
Long time, brother.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.362
I didn't cut it.

29:39.571 --> 29:41.281
But I know who did.

29:41.489 --> 29:42.991
So is there
some kind of finder's fee?

29:52.125 --> 29:53.293
Come in!

29:55.587 --> 29:59.591
Oh, watch it, ladies,
it's the po-po.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.761
And what can I do
for you, Officers?

30:02.969 --> 30:05.555
We have reason to believe
you vandalized
your brother-in-law's car

30:05.764 --> 30:07.640
a couple of weeks ago,
and then threatened him.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.225
Am I a suspect now?

30:09.434 --> 30:13.354
Ladies, they think I might've
killed Wendell.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.064
But you were with us.

30:15.273 --> 30:17.066
Damn right, I was.

30:17.275 --> 30:19.903
We all heard the scream.
We couldn't figure out
what it was.

30:20.111 --> 30:22.906
- You all can vouch that
Clara was with you?
- She was.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.073
Sitting right there.

30:27.577 --> 30:30.538
You poor, dear thing.

30:30.747 --> 30:33.500
You're white as a ghost.
And so skinny.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.877
You need to eat something.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.962
- Oh, that's okay.
- Oh, no, go on. Have a bite.

30:38.171 --> 30:40.006
Be a good girl.

30:41.883 --> 30:44.385
That's it.
Be a good girl.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.429
Eat up, you ugly bitch.

30:46.638 --> 30:49.140
Think you can crap
in my yard, do you?

30:51.893 --> 30:53.895
Hello? Anybody home?

30:57.440 --> 31:00.527
Wendell was offering a dog
a rolled-up piece of bologna.

31:00.735 --> 31:03.279
He wanted to punish it
for pooping in his yard.

31:03.488 --> 31:04.656
You think he was
poisoning the dog?

31:04.864 --> 31:06.950
Well, that's what it
looked like.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.535
It was a spaniel.

31:10.703 --> 31:13.039
Like our reluctant
tipster Byron's.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.334
I don't remember a dog.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.628
Precisely.

31:18.837 --> 31:22.715
He had dog toys and all
those paintings of spaniels,
but no actual spaniel.

31:22.924 --> 31:26.219
What if Wendell
poisoned Byron's dog,
and Byron found out?

31:26.427 --> 31:28.429
Byron crushes Wendell,

31:28.638 --> 31:31.266
then calls in
an anonymous tip fingering
the local juvenile delinquent.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.478
Let's pay the man a visit.

31:41.234 --> 31:42.694
- Officers?
- Evening, Mr. Thistlewaite.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.946
- We had a few more...
- Where's your dog, Byron?

31:45.697 --> 31:46.990
Uh...

31:47.198 --> 31:48.992
"Uh. Uh. Uh."

31:49.200 --> 31:50.994
It's a simple question.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.122
Don't stall for time.
Don't invent a story.
Produce the dog.

31:55.707 --> 31:56.833
Lana!

31:57.041 --> 31:58.751
Come here, girl.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.297
Hmm.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.386
As we suspected...

32:08.595 --> 32:10.305
You have a dog.

32:10.513 --> 32:12.515
That's just a little game
we play called,

32:12.724 --> 32:14.559
"Does the person
we're questioning have a dog?"

32:14.767 --> 32:17.645
- So why'd you...
- Mr. Thistlewaite, we were
just doubling back,

32:17.854 --> 32:19.772
asking a few more questions.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.190
Can you tell us where
you were between
the hours of 10:00 and 11:00

32:21.399 --> 32:22.859
on the night
Wendell was killed?

32:23.067 --> 32:25.737
At the Foggy Duck. It's a pub
a couple blocks over.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.989
- There was a football game.
- Do you remember
who was playing?

32:28.197 --> 32:29.866
- Arsenal-Chelsea.
- Soccer.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.203
Recognize him?

32:34.412 --> 32:36.039
Is that Byron?

32:36.247 --> 32:38.875
Heading into the Foggy Duck
an hour before the murder.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.836
He gets in his car and leaves
an hour after the murder.

32:42.045 --> 32:45.048
I looked into it,
there was an Arsenal-Chelsea
rebroadcast that night.

32:45.256 --> 32:48.885
So his alibi checks out.
He was busy hating America.

32:49.093 --> 32:51.054
Why does it look like
you swallowed a canary?

32:51.262 --> 32:52.680
Because when I went
to the pub,

32:52.889 --> 32:54.807
I saw that there was
a second exit around the side,

32:55.016 --> 32:57.143
one that can't be seen by
the surveillance camera.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.853
But most importantly,

32:59.062 --> 33:02.732
look what I found
tacked up at the pub.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.735
Judging by the flyers
underneath this one and the
ones partially covering it,

33:05.944 --> 33:07.445
I'd guess it's been
up there for about a week.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.322
But we know the dog is alive,
so what does...

33:09.530 --> 33:11.282
What if on the night
of the murder,

33:11.491 --> 33:13.701
Byron sat in this pub
downing pints.

33:13.910 --> 33:17.288
His dog was missing,
and he was sure
Wendell was responsible.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.873
He gets enough
liquid courage in him

33:19.082 --> 33:21.167
that he decides to go
have a chat with Wendell.

33:21.376 --> 33:26.130
He finds the old man
underneath his car,
loses it, kicks out the jack.

33:26.339 --> 33:28.466
Then, a day or two later,
Lana comes wandering back.

33:28.675 --> 33:31.427
- Well, good luck to us
proving it.
- There's the bonus.

33:31.636 --> 33:32.887
Take another look
at the screen, there.

33:33.096 --> 33:34.639
What do you see?

33:40.937 --> 33:43.773
His shoes. Wafflestompers.

33:43.982 --> 33:45.233
Let's hope they're a match.

33:48.403 --> 33:51.572
I'm gonna need you to step
outside while the officers
conduct the search.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.627
Watts, master closet first.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.508
You failed to mention you
misplaced your dog last week.

34:10.717 --> 34:11.968
Was that even relevant?

34:12.176 --> 34:14.804
Well, once we asked
about your dog? Yeah.

34:15.013 --> 34:18.141
I went back and checked out
that Arsenal-Chelsea match.

34:18.349 --> 34:22.103
Right about the time Mr. Gale
was murdered, an Arsenal
player headed in a goal.

34:22.311 --> 34:24.564
Which one was he? Which guy?

34:28.151 --> 34:29.318
This what you were
looking for, Detective?

34:30.695 --> 34:32.030
Thanks, Eric. It is, indeed.

34:37.744 --> 34:40.288
Right here,
we have a boot print
left in Wendell's blood.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.790
What do you know?
It's a match.

34:53.676 --> 34:55.511
I thought he killed her.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.184
He threatened to.
Multiple times.

35:01.392 --> 35:04.520
He said if he caught her in
his yard one more time...

35:04.729 --> 35:06.355
<i>Lana had been missing
a few days,</i>

35:06.564 --> 35:08.024
<i>and I'd searched
the neighborhood.</i>

35:08.232 --> 35:10.860
<i>But in my heart, I knew what
had happened to her.</i>

35:11.069 --> 35:13.863
I had more than a few beers
in me that night.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.948
I know it was you.

35:17.408 --> 35:19.368
What did you do to my dog?

35:19.577 --> 35:22.288
That's one dog
that won't be crapping in
anyone else's yard.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.999
He pretty much admitted
to it, to killing her.

35:31.631 --> 35:34.217
<i>It was one second.</i>

35:34.425 --> 35:37.011
It was one second of my life
that I can't take back.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.351
And that's when I heard it.

36:03.121 --> 36:06.082
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to leave you.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.669
Yes, I am.

36:19.095 --> 36:21.139
A momentary lapse in reason,
and now

36:21.347 --> 36:24.100
Byron will likely spend
his next 20 years in prison.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.686
Well, you did your job.
People don't get to
kill each other willy-nilly.

36:26.894 --> 36:27.812
We're cremating Wendell?

36:29.230 --> 36:31.149
We couldn't find
any next of kin?

36:31.357 --> 36:33.568
We found them.
They just weren't interested
in claiming his body.

36:38.823 --> 36:41.200
<i>What do you have to say
for yourself, Wendell?</i>

36:41.409 --> 36:44.662
<i>Life dealt you a lousy hand,
so you just folded tent,</i>

36:44.871 --> 36:47.707
<i>decided it was easier to be
a rotten bastard.</i>

36:48.875 --> 36:50.209
<i>That's not gonna be me.</i>

36:52.336 --> 36:54.088
<i>I'm going down swinging.</i>

36:55.631 --> 36:58.009
Zombies don't
deserve our mercy, so just

36:58.217 --> 37:00.428
put that thought
out of your head.

37:00.636 --> 37:02.930
How to explain?

37:03.139 --> 37:05.850
I love submarine movies.

37:06.058 --> 37:07.852
Big fan.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.188
And there's always
this moment...

37:10.396 --> 37:13.691
It's the moment where
the sub is torpedoed,

37:13.900 --> 37:15.401
and the compartment
is flooding,

37:15.568 --> 37:19.405
and the captain's gotta give
the order to "seal it up,"

37:19.614 --> 37:24.452
even though he knows
that there are men
still alive in there.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.871
Cut to the sailor
who receives that order,

37:27.079 --> 37:28.706
tears in his eyes,

37:28.915 --> 37:32.210
closing that hatch
on his comrades.

37:34.587 --> 37:37.131
The man that closes that
hatch is a hero, isn't he?

37:37.340 --> 37:39.508
<i>But we are both doing
what needs to be done.</i>

37:39.717 --> 37:42.553
<i>We are saving lives.</i>

37:42.762 --> 37:47.016
<i>- There are zombies
living among us.</i>

37:48.851 --> 37:51.187
<i>And they are feasting
on human brains.</i>

37:51.395 --> 37:54.482
<i>Where do they get
these brains? Who knows?</i>

37:55.233 --> 37:56.234
Ahhh!

37:58.819 --> 38:03.032
But don't you think it's a
good idea to put an end to it?

38:03.241 --> 38:04.867
Sure, they look like us,
they sound like us,

38:05.076 --> 38:08.246
but if you think of them as

38:08.454 --> 38:11.832
brain-eating atomic bombs,
you'll sleep like a baby.

38:13.251 --> 38:14.627
You've got the wrong
man for the job.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.546
Oh, I have the only man
for the job.

38:17.755 --> 38:19.840
<i>More than once now,
Major's run into people</i>

38:20.049 --> 38:22.385
<i>and he's just utterly
convinced they're zombies.</i>

38:22.593 --> 38:24.929
<i>His heart starts racing,
his hair stands on end.</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:27.223
<i>He's a human zombie detector.</i>

38:27.431 --> 38:28.766
See?

38:28.975 --> 38:30.559
You're singularly qualified.

38:32.270 --> 38:34.772
Now, we've learned a few
things about zombies.

38:34.981 --> 38:39.777
Weird as it sounds,
they can't get enough
of spicy food.

38:39.986 --> 38:44.490
And in order to blend in,
they require pretty regular
tanning and hair dyeing.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.119
Our tech boys have
developed an algorithm

38:48.327 --> 38:53.916
which scans credit card
statements for charges which
fit this zombie profile.

38:54.125 --> 38:57.461
Those 322 people are
suspected zombies.

38:57.670 --> 39:01.882
Your mission, determine which
ones are the real deal

39:02.091 --> 39:03.759
and close that hatch on them.

39:03.968 --> 39:04.885
Kill them?

39:06.846 --> 39:07.888
Yes.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.142
After all...

39:11.350 --> 39:13.936
<i>Aren't you the greatest
zombie killer alive?</i>

39:19.025 --> 39:20.026
You forgot your list.

39:20.234 --> 39:22.528
I'm not doing this.

39:22.737 --> 39:25.156
<i>It's Clive.
He's grilling me about
your Meat Cute alibi.</i>

39:25.364 --> 39:27.867
<i>He's like a dog with a bone.
Those five dead henchmen?</i>

39:28.075 --> 39:29.785
<i>He suspects you killed them.</i>

39:31.162 --> 39:33.998
I've got you over a barrel,
big guy.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.460
Five murders, that's a lot
of years in the pokey.

39:40.171 --> 39:41.422
Do what you gotta do.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.841
Major, we are doing
our civic duty here.

39:45.509 --> 39:48.846
We played a big part in
creating this problem.

39:49.055 --> 39:51.557
And we are gonna be
very aggressive
in cleaning it up.

39:52.767 --> 39:54.727
We do know of one zombie,

39:54.935 --> 39:56.354
Liv Moore.

39:56.562 --> 40:00.191
We don't have
to start with her,

40:00.399 --> 40:01.984
but we've gotta
start somewhere.

40:34.809 --> 40:38.270
<i>When I was 21,
it was a very good year.</i>

40:38.479 --> 40:40.439
<i>27? Less great.</i>

40:40.648 --> 40:43.567
<i>Best friend gone.
Love of my life avoiding me.</i>

40:43.776 --> 40:46.987
<i>And my brother and mom still
unwilling to hear me out.</i>

40:47.196 --> 40:50.241
<i>Tomorrow I'll eat a new brain,
get Wendell out of my system.</i>

40:50.449 --> 40:52.284
<i>Maybe someday
I'll be forgiven.</i>

40:52.451 --> 40:54.578
<i>With any luck, someone with
a winning personality</i>

40:54.787 --> 40:57.081
<i>is out there getting
murdered right now.</i>

40:57.289 --> 40:59.250
<i>Whoa. Uncool, Liv.</i>

40:59.458 --> 41:00.751
<i>Get out of my head, Wendell.</i>

41:02.837 --> 41:04.255
- Yeah?
- Hey, roomie.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.590
Wanna watch the season
premiere of <i>Zombie High?</i>

41:06.799 --> 41:08.259
<i>Not really.</i>

41:08.467 --> 41:10.094
<i>I want to stay in here
feeling sorry for myself,</i>

41:10.302 --> 41:12.555
<i>not listen to IRS
break room gossip.</i>

41:12.763 --> 41:14.390
Sounds great.
I'll be right there.

41:18.185 --> 41:19.520
Hmm.

41:19.728 --> 41:21.856
What are those pesky zombies
up to this week?

41:23.607 --> 41:26.235
Death and mayhem.

41:26.444 --> 41:27.987
The ush.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.488
Hey, uh, how was work?

41:30.739 --> 41:32.241
Oh, my God.

41:32.450 --> 41:35.369
You would not believe
the guy we hired.

41:35.578 --> 41:38.789
Super freaking hot.
Like, stupid hot.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.374
<i>Magic Mike</i> hot.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.002
Right on.
Are you gonna work
your Gilda magic on him?

41:43.210 --> 41:45.546
It's under
serious consideration.

41:47.798 --> 41:49.675
Maybe I'll just toy
with him for a while.

41:49.884 --> 41:51.802
Oh, he doesn't stand a chance.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.181
No, zombie!

41:55.389 --> 41:57.016
Dumb, dumb zombie.
