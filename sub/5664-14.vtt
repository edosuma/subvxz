WEBVTT

00:04.416 --> 00:06.625
Come on, Mills.

00:06.625 --> 00:08.000
You got this.

00:11.250 --> 00:15.000
(groans)

00:15.000 --> 00:18.166
Quick and nimble,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.166
quick and nimble.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.416
(people chattering)

00:27.416 --> 00:28.958
(whoops)

00:28.958 --> 00:29.958
(laughing):

00:28.958 --> 00:29.958
Nice.

00:29.958 --> 00:31.375
You picked up some moves.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.916
Yeah, that's the thing

00:31.375 --> 00:32.916
about being trapped

00:32.916 --> 00:35.791
in a timeless dimension

00:32.916 --> 00:35.791
filled with sheer rock walls.

00:35.791 --> 00:37.750
You find your inner

00:35.791 --> 00:37.750
Spider-Man real fast.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.708
(grunts)

00:43.708 --> 00:45.291
Sorry, I didn't mean

00:45.291 --> 00:47.500
to bring back bad memories.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.916
I just thought coming here

00:48.916 --> 00:49.916
might be a good way

00:48.916 --> 00:49.916
to blow off steam.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.125
No sweat.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.500
No more

00:51.125 --> 00:52.500
withdrawal symptoms

00:52.500 --> 00:53.750
from the symbol?

00:53.750 --> 00:55.375
I'm getting

00:53.750 --> 00:55.375
a handle on it.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.166
Crane has been helping me

00:57.166 --> 00:59.375
through some behavior

00:57.166 --> 00:59.375
modification techniques,

00:59.375 --> 01:00.708
or as he insists on calling it,

01:00.708 --> 01:03.083
"A diet of the mind."

01:03.083 --> 01:04.208
Franklin?

01:04.208 --> 01:06.041
No,  A Beautiful Mind.

01:06.041 --> 01:07.458
I never should have gotten him

01:06.041 --> 01:07.458
the Netflix subscription.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.916
(laughs)

01:08.916 --> 01:10.708
At least it didn't

01:08.916 --> 01:10.708
slow you down any.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.000
You're in kickass shape.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.500
We'll see.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.583
Reynolds has scheduled

01:13.500 --> 01:15.583
an FBI survival

01:15.583 --> 01:16.791
training exercise this weekend.

01:16.791 --> 01:18.541
Are you sure you're up for that?

01:18.541 --> 01:20.333
I mean,

01:20.333 --> 01:22.083
are you sure you're up for a

01:20.333 --> 01:22.083
weekend with Daniel Reynolds?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.041
Yeah, Danny and I are good.

01:24.041 --> 01:25.791
He told you he loves you.

01:25.791 --> 01:26.958
Loved.

01:26.958 --> 01:28.666
Past tense.

01:26.958 --> 01:28.666
Okay.

01:28.666 --> 01:31.166
Whatever we were,

01:28.666 --> 01:31.166
he's my boss now.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.750
It's all about timing.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.750
Hmm.

01:33.750 --> 01:34.791
You, of all people,

01:34.791 --> 01:36.458
should know that.

01:34.791 --> 01:36.458
Hmm?

01:36.458 --> 01:38.500
Didn't Joe just

01:36.458 --> 01:38.500
buy you a trailer?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.333
Did it come

01:38.500 --> 01:40.333
with a white picket fence?

01:40.333 --> 01:42.125
(scoffs) I mean, he means well,

01:42.125 --> 01:45.041
but sometimes

01:42.125 --> 01:45.041
he can just be such a...

01:45.041 --> 01:46.250
guy, you know?

01:46.250 --> 01:48.291
(laughs)

01:46.250 --> 01:48.291
MAN: Hey, hold on,

01:48.291 --> 01:49.791
it looks like you're

01:48.291 --> 01:49.791
having some trouble.

01:49.791 --> 01:51.125
Let me help you with that.

01:51.125 --> 01:52.166
Thanks, I'm good.

01:52.166 --> 01:53.458
No, no, no, it's okay.

01:53.458 --> 01:55.250
This can be a little

01:55.250 --> 01:57.166
challenging, so...

01:55.250 --> 01:57.166
Oh!

01:57.166 --> 01:59.208
It's got to be strong.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.208
Mm.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.250
Go ahead.

02:10.708 --> 02:12.125
(grunting)

02:15.250 --> 02:17.458
(panting)

02:19.708 --> 02:21.375
It can be challenging.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.250
PANDORA:

02:27.125 --> 02:29.250
My love,

02:29.250 --> 02:31.708
I have excellent tidings.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.708
I have recovered another

02:33.750 --> 02:36.708
fragment of the Box.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.791
The Beacon's siren call

02:50.625 --> 02:53.791
will now be heard

02:53.791 --> 02:56.208
in the depths

02:53.791 --> 02:56.208
of every corner of this world.

02:56.208 --> 03:01.083
Creatures of darkness

02:56.208 --> 03:01.083
will awaken...

03:01.083 --> 03:03.750
and come to give

03:01.083 --> 03:03.750
their spirits to you.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.375
You have done well.

03:06.375 --> 03:10.208
I am down to the dregs of

03:06.375 --> 03:10.208
the energy we collected.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.833
I hunger for more.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.666
They will come.

03:13.666 --> 03:16.000
Soon you will be restored

03:13.666 --> 03:16.000
to your full glory...

03:17.250 --> 03:19.708
...and then you can

03:17.250 --> 03:19.708
restore my Box.

03:22.375 --> 03:26.250
Do not mar this moment

03:22.375 --> 03:26.250
with your selfish needs.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.333
All will be made whole...

03:30.333 --> 03:32.583
...in time.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.291
Of course, my love.

03:48.583 --> 03:51.166
Now that's some Willy Wonka

03:48.583 --> 03:51.166
setup you got here.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.000
Thank you, Lieutenant.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.041
Though it is not

03:53.000 --> 03:55.041
chocolaty treats

03:55.041 --> 03:56.250
we endeavor to find here,

03:56.250 --> 03:58.166
but answers.

03:58.166 --> 03:59.250
Just...

03:59.250 --> 04:00.416
please.

04:00.416 --> 04:02.000
Careful with this one.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
This caused the Great Fire

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
of Chicago.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.250
And...

04:05.250 --> 04:07.000
Krakatoa.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.541
You getting anywhere?

04:10.541 --> 04:11.875
Unfortunately, no.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.333
As far as I can tell,

04:13.333 --> 04:15.708
this is unlike any material

04:13.333 --> 04:15.708
known to man.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.541
And my investigation

04:17.541 --> 04:20.500
has been somewhat curtailed

04:17.541 --> 04:20.500
by our limited resources,

04:20.500 --> 04:21.958
which is why I have sought

04:21.958 --> 04:25.250
the help of

04:21.958 --> 04:25.250
an outside expert,

04:25.250 --> 04:26.250
Professor Cranston

04:26.250 --> 04:27.666
of Rochester.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.625
He specializes

04:27.666 --> 04:29.625
in arcane materials.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.458
He's agreed to meet us

04:29.625 --> 04:32.458
in his laboratory tomorrow.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.750
I'm hoping he could

04:32.458 --> 04:34.750
shed some light

04:34.750 --> 04:36.000
on some of

04:34.750 --> 04:36.000
our other artifacts...

04:36.000 --> 04:37.875
Rochester?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.625
I have the FBI

04:37.875 --> 04:39.625
training exercise;

04:39.625 --> 04:40.625
it's gonna take all weekend.

04:40.625 --> 04:42.000
Of course.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.291
Well, I can reschedule.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.833
No, you should go.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.000
Are you certain?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.375
I would not want to derail

04:52.375 --> 04:53.916
any of the progress we made.

04:53.916 --> 04:55.250
You've done enough, Crane,

04:55.250 --> 04:56.833
and besides,

04:55.250 --> 04:56.833
the exercise will help

04:56.833 --> 04:58.125
get my mind off of things,

04:58.125 --> 04:59.291
dive into something

04:58.125 --> 04:59.291
work-related.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.083
I would get Jenny

04:59.291 --> 05:01.083
to go with you,

05:01.083 --> 05:02.375
but she's with Joe...

05:02.375 --> 05:05.041
following up

05:02.375 --> 05:05.041
on a Sumerian artifact

05:05.041 --> 05:06.208
that just hit

05:05.041 --> 05:06.208
the black market.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.416
As well they should.

05:07.416 --> 05:09.625
Anything Sumerian

05:07.416 --> 05:09.625
these days

05:09.625 --> 05:10.875
is surely related

05:09.625 --> 05:10.875
to Pandora

05:10.875 --> 05:12.458
and the Hidden One,

05:10.875 --> 05:12.458
and their plans.

05:12.458 --> 05:16.458
Plans about which we still

05:12.458 --> 05:16.458
know precious little.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.125
Which is why we need to get

05:16.458 --> 05:19.125
to the bottom of what that is,

05:19.125 --> 05:20.708
and the thing

05:19.125 --> 05:20.708
about these symbols

05:20.708 --> 05:22.625
of evil is they tend to just

05:20.708 --> 05:22.625
be the tip of the iceberg.

05:22.625 --> 05:27.000
Very well,

05:22.625 --> 05:27.000
I shall to Rochester alone.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.375
You know what,

05:27.000 --> 05:29.375
I knew Colonel Rochester.

05:29.375 --> 05:30.708
Peevish sort.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.708
(chuckles)

05:31.708 --> 05:32.875
It seems a surprise

05:32.875 --> 05:35.041
they'd name a city after him.

05:35.041 --> 05:37.083
He hardly deserves that honor.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.875
You haven't seen Rochester.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.583
My sources can't find

05:44.166 --> 05:45.583
any more details

05:45.583 --> 05:47.166
on that mystery artifact.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.125
Just that it's getting

05:47.166 --> 05:49.125
a lot of attention

05:49.125 --> 05:50.791
and it's going on

05:49.125 --> 05:50.791
the block tomorrow night.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.875
Who's the seller?

05:50.791 --> 05:52.875
Anonymous.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.875
Most likely a relic hunter

05:52.875 --> 05:54.875
who stumbled on something

05:54.875 --> 05:56.541
that's out of his league

05:54.875 --> 05:56.541
and he wants to unload it.

05:56.541 --> 05:58.541
These auctions

05:56.541 --> 05:58.541
are set up on the fly.

05:58.541 --> 06:02.333
Fast, in-and-out,

05:58.541 --> 06:02.333
no questions asked.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.583
Oh.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.166
That's a lot of heavy hitters

06:05.166 --> 06:06.500
on the invite list.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.416
Look, $10,000

06:06.500 --> 06:09.416
minimum reserve.

06:09.416 --> 06:12.208
Though I guess that's not

06:09.416 --> 06:12.208
a problem for you anymore,

06:12.208 --> 06:15.208
unless you spent it all buying

06:12.208 --> 06:15.208
another trailer for someone.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.000
Wow, you are not letting

06:15.208 --> 06:18.000
that go any time soon, are you?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.416
Not in this lifetime.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.125
Okay.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.375
Okay, you want to know

06:21.125 --> 06:23.375
why I bought you that trailer?

06:25.375 --> 06:26.958
Because I could.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.125
Well, that explains everything.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.291
No, no, no,

06:28.125 --> 06:29.291
I'm serious, listen,

06:29.291 --> 06:30.458
I mean, like, most of the time,

06:30.458 --> 06:31.458
we are in your world.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.125
It's like...

06:33.125 --> 06:35.791
black market auctions,

06:33.125 --> 06:35.791
supernatural artifacts...

06:35.791 --> 06:38.041
okay, so...

06:35.791 --> 06:38.041
I thought that

06:38.041 --> 06:39.208
it was kind of

06:38.041 --> 06:39.208
great that, like,

06:39.208 --> 06:41.291
just this one time,

06:41.291 --> 06:43.708
I could be the one

06:41.291 --> 06:43.708
steering the boat.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.833
Or... steering the ship, or...

06:45.833 --> 06:48.416
the trailer--

06:45.833 --> 06:48.416
whatever-- okay?

06:48.416 --> 06:51.625
Mm, Joe...

06:51.625 --> 06:54.166
I love that you want to step up.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.958
And I know that you want

06:54.166 --> 06:55.958
to do the right thing.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.583
So, I guess...

07:00.583 --> 07:03.166
we just both need

07:00.583 --> 07:03.166
to remember that

07:03.166 --> 07:04.875
what's important...

07:04.875 --> 07:06.791
is that you never...

07:06.791 --> 07:08.250
ever...

07:08.250 --> 07:10.416
touch my stuff.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.458
Should have seen that coming.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.583
REYNOLDS:  All right, everyone,

07:17.583 --> 07:18.958
I'm guessing it's been awhile

07:18.958 --> 07:20.125
since your last

07:18.958 --> 07:20.125
refresher course

07:20.125 --> 07:21.625
in survival training.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.125
I know I haven't done

07:21.625 --> 07:24.125
a course since Quantico.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.041
So, this weekend

07:24.125 --> 07:26.041
may be challenging.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.416
That's why

07:26.041 --> 07:28.416
we're working in teams.

07:28.416 --> 07:29.541
Work with your teammates.

07:29.541 --> 07:30.666
Cover their backs,

07:30.666 --> 07:32.458
and they'll cover yours.

07:34.041 --> 07:36.541
Hello, agents,

07:34.041 --> 07:36.541
My name is Robbie Malone

07:36.541 --> 07:38.333
and I'll be one

07:36.541 --> 07:38.333
of the wilderness guides.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.083
Now, the rules are simple.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.958
Each team will be given a map

07:41.958 --> 07:43.875
showing a designated waypoint.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.791
You'll have 48 hours

07:43.875 --> 07:45.791
to get there.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.208
You'll be provided

07:45.791 --> 07:47.208
with basic equipment,

07:47.208 --> 07:49.333
but no cell phones.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.708
Any questions?

07:51.708 --> 07:53.208
If you grab your packs, you'll

07:51.708 --> 07:53.208
find your group assignments.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.625
Mm-hmm.

07:57.125 --> 07:58.625
Looks like

07:57.125 --> 07:58.625
we're teammates.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.500
Yeah.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.500
Along with Ramirez.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.708
Where is he?

08:02.708 --> 08:04.041
Mount Sinai Hospital.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
Appendicitis.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.541
Called in this morning.

08:07.541 --> 08:09.416
Are we getting a sub?

08:09.416 --> 08:10.916
Yeah, me.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.458
That good with everyone?

08:14.458 --> 08:16.625
Absolutely.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.500
Good, let's get going.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.833
No, this isn't gonna

08:21.333 --> 08:23.833
be awkward at all.

08:26.125 --> 08:27.916
SOPHIE:

08:26.125 --> 08:27.916
I got to say,

08:27.916 --> 08:30.541
I've never been

08:27.916 --> 08:30.541
an outdoors-y type.

08:30.541 --> 08:31.958
Closest I ever got

08:30.541 --> 08:31.958
to camping

08:31.958 --> 08:33.708
was watching

08:31.958 --> 08:33.708
Friday the 13th  movies.

08:33.708 --> 08:35.458
(laughs)

08:35.458 --> 08:38.208
Yeah, I didn't spend much

08:35.458 --> 08:38.208
time in the wild either.

08:38.208 --> 08:39.500
Until I had to.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.875
You mind

08:39.500 --> 08:41.875
if I ask you something?

08:41.875 --> 08:43.250
Hmm?

08:43.250 --> 08:45.500
When you were trapped

08:43.250 --> 08:45.500
in that other dimension,

08:45.500 --> 08:46.625
did you ever think

08:45.500 --> 08:46.625
you weren't gonna

08:46.625 --> 08:48.583
get out of there?

08:46.625 --> 08:48.583
I had moments...

08:48.583 --> 08:49.708
but I knew Crane was

08:48.583 --> 08:49.708
out there looking for me.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.333
I held onto that.

08:51.333 --> 08:52.750
And he told me

08:51.333 --> 08:52.750
that you helped him

08:52.750 --> 08:54.375
a lot while I was gone.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.416
So I appreciate that.

08:55.416 --> 08:56.541
I mean,

08:55.416 --> 08:56.541
I don't know if

08:56.541 --> 08:58.250
I "helped" very much.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.583
Mostly I just

08:59.583 --> 09:01.083
asked a lot

08:59.583 --> 09:01.083
of questions about monsters

09:01.083 --> 09:02.291
and made a face like, uh...

09:02.291 --> 09:03.791
Yeah?

09:02.291 --> 09:03.791
No, it was more like...

09:03.791 --> 09:05.333
(stammering)

09:05.333 --> 09:07.041
Something like that.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.041
(laughing ): Whatever.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.541
No, it was.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.541
It was like that.

09:08.541 --> 09:09.916
You have adjusted to

09:08.541 --> 09:09.916
this craziness

09:09.916 --> 09:11.791
better than most.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.541
Maybe it's because

09:13.500 --> 09:15.541
I always wanted to believe

09:15.541 --> 09:17.375
that this other world

09:15.541 --> 09:17.375
was out there.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.875
When I was a kid,

09:19.875 --> 09:23.291
my parents disappeared

09:19.875 --> 09:23.291
under mysterious circumstances,

09:23.291 --> 09:25.625
and I never got a good

09:23.291 --> 09:25.625
explanation for what happened.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.291
So when I found out that

09:28.291 --> 09:32.375
magic and mystical dimensions

09:28.291 --> 09:32.375
were actually real,

09:32.375 --> 09:34.875
it gave me hope

09:32.375 --> 09:34.875
that someday,

09:34.875 --> 09:37.333
I may actually get some answers.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.166
My first run-in

09:39.375 --> 09:41.166
with the supernatural,

09:41.166 --> 09:42.958
I was a kid, too.

09:42.958 --> 09:46.041
It messed me and my family up

09:42.958 --> 09:46.041
for a long time.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.291
The supernatural...

09:48.291 --> 09:49.916
took a lot away from me.

09:49.916 --> 09:54.166
So I guess I got used

09:49.916 --> 09:54.166
to looking at it that way,

09:54.166 --> 09:56.625
and then here you are...

09:56.625 --> 09:59.041
seeing the upside.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.333
ROBBIE:

10:01.958 --> 10:03.333
So...

10:03.333 --> 10:05.250
when you can't

10:03.333 --> 10:05.250
see the sun,

10:05.250 --> 10:06.500
you can always remember that

10:06.500 --> 10:08.791
moss grows on

10:06.500 --> 10:08.791
the north side of trees,

10:08.791 --> 10:10.000
and...

10:18.041 --> 10:19.916
Who'd put a well

10:18.041 --> 10:19.916
way out here?

10:19.916 --> 10:21.750
Look at this.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.750
The Dutch...

10:23.750 --> 10:24.833
they settled this area

10:24.833 --> 10:28.041
back in the 1600s,

10:28.041 --> 10:29.375
and judging

10:28.041 --> 10:29.375
from the looks of this thing,

10:29.375 --> 10:30.500
it could be that old.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.666
The cover's freshly broken.

10:32.666 --> 10:36.041
Almost as if it was

10:32.666 --> 10:36.041
busted from the inside out.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.625
Whatever the case,

10:36.041 --> 10:38.625
this thing is a hazard.

10:38.625 --> 10:41.833
I have to report it

10:38.625 --> 10:41.833
to the rangers.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.541
All right, come on,

10:41.833 --> 10:43.541
we better catch up.

10:54.083 --> 10:55.666
(screeching)

10:55.666 --> 10:57.875
REYNOLDS:

10:55.666 --> 10:57.875
Robbie, come on.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.291
(growling)

11:11.791 --> 11:14.791
♪ ♪

11:49.416 --> 11:51.500
This seems familiar.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.583
We're in the woods.

11:52.583 --> 11:53.791
Everything looks familiar.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.166
Yeah, this looks familiar,

11:55.166 --> 11:56.500
like the same,

11:55.166 --> 11:56.500
like we have

11:56.500 --> 11:57.833
walked in a circle,

11:56.500 --> 11:57.833
haven't we?

11:57.833 --> 12:01.375
We may have gone

11:57.833 --> 12:01.375
in a circle-like direction.

12:03.333 --> 12:06.208
You think you could do better,

12:03.333 --> 12:06.208
Davy Crockett?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.750
(laughing):

12:06.208 --> 12:07.750
I can't do worse.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.625
So...

12:15.625 --> 12:17.583
it's tough news

12:15.625 --> 12:17.583
about Ramirez.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.000
He'll be okay.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.000
It's a routine procedure.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.791
I'm glad it worked

12:20.000 --> 12:21.791
out this way, though.

12:21.791 --> 12:23.333
Not that Ramirez

12:21.791 --> 12:23.333
got sick, but...

12:23.333 --> 12:25.583
I'm glad you're on my team.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.375
I've been, uh...

12:29.375 --> 12:30.833
sorting through

12:29.375 --> 12:30.833
some stuff lately,

12:30.833 --> 12:33.583
and a part of

12:30.833 --> 12:33.583
that process involves me

12:33.583 --> 12:35.666
clearing the air with people

12:33.583 --> 12:35.666
that I care about,

12:35.666 --> 12:38.166
and I owe you

12:35.666 --> 12:38.166
some answers, so...

12:38.166 --> 12:39.625
it's good that we'll have

12:38.166 --> 12:39.625
some time together.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.750
I'm glad you're

12:39.625 --> 12:41.750
working things out,

12:41.750 --> 12:43.291
but I didn't plan on this.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.250
Your group needed a third

12:45.250 --> 12:46.333
and I was available.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.458
That's it.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.000
I got it from here.

12:54.750 --> 12:57.916
(classical music plays)

13:03.541 --> 13:05.625
Thank you.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.750
Encrypted burner phone.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.875
Allows for anonymous bidding.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.541
Folks in this crowd

13:10.541 --> 13:12.333
don't always like

13:10.541 --> 13:12.333
to advertise their interests.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.500
Plus, they love

13:12.333 --> 13:14.500
the cloak-and-dagger of it all.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.125
Jenny Mills.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.083
I'd heard you were no longer

13:16.125 --> 13:18.083
in acquisitions.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.416
I still dabble.

13:19.416 --> 13:20.416
Joe,

13:20.416 --> 13:21.500
this is Hans Christinger,

13:21.500 --> 13:22.916
a dealer out of...

13:22.916 --> 13:24.375
I'm between places

13:22.916 --> 13:24.375
at the moment.

13:24.375 --> 13:25.958
Joe Corbin.

13:25.958 --> 13:26.958
Corbin?

13:26.958 --> 13:28.791
As in August's son?

13:28.791 --> 13:30.250
Following in

13:28.791 --> 13:30.250
the family business, are we?

13:30.250 --> 13:31.708
Yeah, something like that.

13:31.708 --> 13:32.791
So what have you heard

13:31.708 --> 13:32.791
about the product?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.583
Sumerian fragment.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.750
Early Dynastic period.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.625
It has some...

13:37.625 --> 13:39.791
intriguing characteristics.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.375
(crowd murmuring)

13:48.375 --> 13:50.000
Oh, my God.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.416
That's part

13:50.000 --> 13:51.416
of Pandora's box.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.000
That thing still

13:51.416 --> 13:53.000
has residual energy.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.583
Joe, the Box is the source

13:53.000 --> 13:55.583
of Pandora's power.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.125
I've seen what

13:55.583 --> 13:57.125
she can do with it,

13:57.125 --> 13:58.166
up close and personal.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.375
If she somehow manages

13:59.375 --> 14:00.791
to collect the pieces

14:00.791 --> 14:01.833
and put it back together...

14:01.833 --> 14:03.208
She and the Hidden One

14:03.208 --> 14:04.708
are gonna be back in business.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.583
(sighs)

14:21.125 --> 14:22.250
(twig snaps)

14:30.375 --> 14:31.250
(distant screech)

14:36.458 --> 14:37.750
(screeching)

14:37.750 --> 14:39.708
(screaming)

14:39.708 --> 14:42.333
(screaming continues)

14:43.791 --> 14:45.166
(screeching)

14:54.416 --> 14:55.791
(screeching continues)

14:55.791 --> 14:57.208
(screams)

15:02.250 --> 15:04.166
(gasping)

15:04.166 --> 15:06.625
Holy hell,

15:04.166 --> 15:06.625
what was that thing?

15:06.625 --> 15:07.625
Okay, okay.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.291
Robbie, stay with me.

15:10.291 --> 15:11.458
Here, just apply pressure.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.000
Yeah.

15:15.666 --> 15:16.666
What happened?

15:16.666 --> 15:18.583
Uh...

15:18.583 --> 15:20.166
Coyote. We chased it off.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.291
Coyotes?

15:21.291 --> 15:22.833
Out here?

15:21.291 --> 15:22.833
Yeah.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.541
What are you doing?

15:27.541 --> 15:28.791
The guides carry

15:28.791 --> 15:30.541
satphones in case

15:28.791 --> 15:30.541
of an emergency.

15:30.541 --> 15:32.416
Damn it, it's broken.

15:32.416 --> 15:33.416
He must have landed on it.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.041
How's he doing?

15:36.041 --> 15:37.541
We got to get him to help.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.041
Okay, Foster,

15:37.541 --> 15:39.041
you stay here with him.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.458
Mills, you come with me.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.458
We got to build something

15:40.458 --> 15:42.625
to get him out of here.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.625
Sir.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.583
(whispering):

15:42.625 --> 15:45.583
All right.

15:45.583 --> 15:47.625
SOPHIE:  I've got the bleeding

15:45.583 --> 15:47.625
under control.

15:47.625 --> 15:48.708
He's stable for now.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.291
(softly):

15:48.708 --> 15:50.291
His feet.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.750
All right,

15:53.333 --> 15:54.750
let's lift him up gently.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.416
Okay.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.416
Let us take

15:54.750 --> 15:56.416
the first shift.

15:56.416 --> 15:58.583
You figure out where

15:56.416 --> 15:58.583
we're going, lead the way.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.125
You sure?

15:58.583 --> 16:01.125
Yeah.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.875
You're the one been practicing

16:01.125 --> 16:02.875
with the compass, right?

16:02.875 --> 16:04.416
Yeah.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.000
(sighs)

16:08.958 --> 16:11.166
I found some images

16:08.958 --> 16:11.166
on Robbie's camera.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.708
It looks like they

16:11.166 --> 16:12.708
stumbled across something,

16:12.708 --> 16:15.125
something that had

16:12.708 --> 16:15.125
been hidden away.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.208
Those markings?

16:17.208 --> 16:18.625
They're Dutch.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.583
About 400 years old.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.583
It's a warning.

16:20.583 --> 16:21.625
That word there...

16:21.625 --> 16:22.916
Verslinder,

16:22.916 --> 16:24.375
means "one who devours."

16:24.375 --> 16:27.125
As in our bite-happy

16:24.375 --> 16:27.125
friend, okay, so...

16:27.125 --> 16:30.333
we have a 400-year-old

16:27.125 --> 16:30.333
Dutch monster on the loose,

16:30.333 --> 16:32.750
but no way to warn anyone

16:30.333 --> 16:32.750
or call for help.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.666
(sighs)

16:32.750 --> 16:34.666
Great.

16:34.666 --> 16:37.458
I thought

16:34.666 --> 16:37.458
this was gonna be tough.

16:47.333 --> 16:48.875
There's something out there.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.375
We need to tell him

16:51.541 --> 16:53.375
what's going on.

16:53.375 --> 16:54.916
We can't tell him.

16:54.916 --> 16:56.958
Every time I let somebody

16:54.916 --> 16:56.958
into this world,

16:56.958 --> 16:58.208
their lives are ruined.

16:58.208 --> 17:00.000
Truth is dangerous.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.375
No.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.583
We handle this without him.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.041
(sighs)

17:05.083 --> 17:06.541
Danny!

17:06.541 --> 17:08.375
Can you come over?!

17:08.375 --> 17:09.666
What are you doing?

17:09.666 --> 17:12.041
You and Reynolds

17:09.666 --> 17:12.041
get him out of here.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.500
I'm going after this thing.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.041
By yourself?

17:15.041 --> 17:16.875
Mm-hmm.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.333
Hey, I'm tired.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.458
Can we switch?

17:19.458 --> 17:20.500
Yeah, we can all take a break.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.666
Uh...

17:21.666 --> 17:24.541
no, I'm actually-- I'm good.

17:24.541 --> 17:25.875
Okay, you take a breather.

17:25.875 --> 17:26.875
Catch up when you can.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.916
Will do.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.041
Be careful.

17:34.041 --> 17:36.083
Yeah.

17:53.125 --> 17:55.416
(panting)

18:02.125 --> 18:03.833
(groans)

18:03.833 --> 18:05.208
(sighs)

18:06.250 --> 18:07.875
Lieutenant, please.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.041
(gasping)

18:19.625 --> 18:20.875
(heart beating)

18:20.875 --> 18:23.250
(heartbeat increasing)

18:26.166 --> 18:27.333
(screeching)

18:27.333 --> 18:28.458
(grunting)

18:28.458 --> 18:29.583
(screeching continues)

18:34.125 --> 18:37.708
(gasping)

18:37.708 --> 18:39.250
(screeching continues)

18:41.000 --> 18:42.666
(gasping)

18:45.583 --> 18:46.583
(screeching continues)

18:46.583 --> 18:47.583
(screaming)

19:08.041 --> 19:09.625
(panting)

19:11.875 --> 19:13.000
I'm making that face again,

19:11.875 --> 19:13.000
aren't I?

19:18.458 --> 19:21.166
ABBIE:

19:18.458 --> 19:21.166
Good news is we've knocked

19:18.458 --> 19:21.166
that thing back twice now,

19:21.166 --> 19:23.000
so it should lay low

19:21.166 --> 19:23.000
for a while.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.791
Bad news is

19:23.000 --> 19:24.791
it can regenerate.

19:24.791 --> 19:27.708
Which means it may be

19:24.791 --> 19:27.708
impossible to kill.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.458
That explains why it

19:27.708 --> 19:29.458
was sealed up in that well.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.000
There was no other way

19:29.458 --> 19:31.000
to get rid of the thing.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.333
Mm-hmm.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.583
Wait, that explains

19:32.333 --> 19:33.583
something else, too.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.083
I took a closer look

19:33.583 --> 19:35.083
at those photos

19:35.083 --> 19:37.416
and found another phrase:

19:35.083 --> 19:37.416
"There is no end."

19:41.208 --> 19:42.791
Look...

19:42.791 --> 19:44.000
I know you said the supernatural

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
has taken a lot from you,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.291
but you gotta remember

19:46.291 --> 19:47.500
the supernatural

19:46.291 --> 19:47.500
has given you

19:47.500 --> 19:49.458
a lot of good, too.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.916
It led you to Crane.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.375
Hey...

20:03.375 --> 20:05.625
It's gonna be dark soon.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.083
We need to find

20:05.625 --> 20:07.083
a place to make camp.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.750
I saw an abandoned cabin

20:07.083 --> 20:09.750
over the ridge.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.083
Not much, but...

20:11.083 --> 20:12.541
it can provide us

20:11.083 --> 20:12.541
with some shelter.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.375
All right, let's get going.

20:26.958 --> 20:27.958
Thanks.

20:27.958 --> 20:29.291
Yeah.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.583
I'm gonna go gather some wood

20:32.583 --> 20:34.666
and make a fire, all right?

20:32.583 --> 20:34.666
(sighs)

20:35.708 --> 20:37.791
He's getting worse.

20:37.791 --> 20:39.333
I never seen

20:37.791 --> 20:39.333
an animal bite

20:39.333 --> 20:40.625
get infected this quickly.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.250
How far do you think

20:40.625 --> 20:42.250
it is to help?

20:42.250 --> 20:44.916
Five, six miles,

20:42.250 --> 20:44.916
as the crow flies.

20:44.916 --> 20:47.291
I could cover that

20:44.916 --> 20:47.291
a lot quicker going solo.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.916
Let's wait till morning.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.791
I'm not sure he has that long.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.791
And if you get lost

20:51.791 --> 20:53.250
out there, then what?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.208
Then that's on me.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.458
This group, this entire outing,

20:55.208 --> 20:57.458
is my responsibility.

20:57.458 --> 20:58.458
I'm not losing anyone,

20:58.458 --> 20:59.958
not on my watch.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.375
Hey, you're not the only

20:59.958 --> 21:01.375
one that cares about...

21:01.375 --> 21:02.666
You don't get it.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.666
I'm in charge.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.083
Okay.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.666
That means if someone gets hurt,

21:04.083 --> 21:05.666
I get help.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.333
If someone's in trouble,

21:05.666 --> 21:07.333
I save them.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.833
And if they go missing,

21:07.333 --> 21:09.833
I will find them.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.250
I don't give up on people.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.750
Danny, when I went away,

21:12.750 --> 21:14.791
it was never about giving up,

21:14.791 --> 21:16.375
and it was never about you.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.791
That's just it, isn't it?

21:17.791 --> 21:19.708
It's never about anyone else.

21:19.708 --> 21:20.916
There's no room

21:19.708 --> 21:20.916
for supporting players

21:20.916 --> 21:21.958
on the Abbie Mills' show.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.083
Well, if you

21:21.958 --> 21:23.083
felt that way,

21:23.083 --> 21:24.291
why'd you ask me back?

21:24.291 --> 21:25.750
Maybe I didn't want to.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.666
What does that mean?

21:29.666 --> 21:30.958
Let's just say

21:30.958 --> 21:32.625
I can't explain

21:30.958 --> 21:32.625
everything to you,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.375
just like you can't

21:32.625 --> 21:34.375
explain everything to me.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.750
I want to be honest with you.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.291
Really.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.000
You know, sometimes

21:40.291 --> 21:42.000
we lie to people so much,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
we forget that we're also

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
lying to ourselves.

21:45.541 --> 21:48.000
I'm going to get help.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.250
You take care of Robbie.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.666
ANNOUNCER:

21:52.333 --> 21:54.666
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.333
We will begin the auction now.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.250
Minimum bid to start

21:57.333 --> 22:00.250
at $10,000.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.625
Please, enter your bids now.

22:03.791 --> 22:05.000
And let us begin.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.166
$20,000.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.458
These people even know

22:09.458 --> 22:10.916
what this thing is?

22:09.458 --> 22:10.916
Probably not,

22:10.916 --> 22:12.333
but it's active.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.333
A lot of what they

22:12.333 --> 22:14.333
see is long dead.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.333
People will pay a lot

22:14.333 --> 22:16.333
of money for real magic.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.125
ANNOUNCER: $30,000.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.500
$100,000.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.125
(crowd murmuring)

22:29.125 --> 22:31.833
$200,000.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.333
(whispering):

22:36.166 --> 22:37.333
Hans.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.250
Okay.

22:49.583 --> 22:50.916
(crowd gasping)

22:50.916 --> 22:52.875
ANNOUNCER:

22:50.916 --> 22:52.875
The bid is one million.

22:52.875 --> 22:55.250
(crowd chattering)

22:55.250 --> 22:56.875
Told you.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.291
I want to steer the boat.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.958
ANNOUNCER:

22:59.291 --> 23:00.958
Going once...

23:00.958 --> 23:03.375
going twice...

23:03.375 --> 23:06.041
sold.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:12.375 --> 23:14.583
please return to...

23:14.583 --> 23:15.875
I'm going to

23:14.583 --> 23:15.875
go close out.

23:15.875 --> 23:16.958
You keep an eye on our prize.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.083
You bet.

23:18.083 --> 23:20.541
(crowd chattering)

23:27.500 --> 23:29.375
(sighs)

23:40.375 --> 23:41.375
W-w-wait, don't...

23:42.958 --> 23:44.791
Come on.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.166
Let's get this thing

23:44.791 --> 23:47.166
out of here.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.125
I felt your call.

24:04.458 --> 24:07.458
(whispering):

24:04.458 --> 24:07.458
Despoiled by mortal hands.

24:08.458 --> 24:10.458
Not for long.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.291
Come on, buddy.

24:14.291 --> 24:16.416
Hang in there.

24:16.416 --> 24:17.583
SOPHIE:

24:16.416 --> 24:17.583
Hey...

24:18.708 --> 24:19.875
I think

24:18.708 --> 24:19.875
you should see this.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.250
I was looking for stuff

24:21.250 --> 24:22.625
we might be able to use.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.041
Pulled away some of the flooring

24:24.041 --> 24:25.083
upstairs, and found this.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.416
"Journal

24:26.208 --> 24:28.416
of Christopher Dampier."

24:28.416 --> 24:29.916
He was an English trapper.

24:29.916 --> 24:31.458
Worked mostly

24:29.916 --> 24:31.458
in the northern territories,

24:31.458 --> 24:34.083
until he came down

24:31.458 --> 24:34.083
to this area around 1650.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.750
He describes coming

24:34.083 --> 24:36.750
with his brother

24:36.750 --> 24:39.291
to a village

24:36.750 --> 24:39.291
not far from here.

24:39.291 --> 24:42.041
"Thomas and I

24:39.291 --> 24:42.041
arrived at Rondout,

24:42.041 --> 24:44.500
"a Dutch trading post

24:42.041 --> 24:44.500
on the banks of the Hudson.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.750
"The villagers have recently

24:44.500 --> 24:47.750
endured a terrible calamity,

24:47.750 --> 24:50.375
"an attack

24:47.750 --> 24:50.375
by a devilish creature.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.250
"A creature they call...

24:52.250 --> 24:53.333
the  Verslinder."

24:55.541 --> 24:58.250
"The beast felled

24:55.541 --> 24:58.250
nearly two score

24:58.250 --> 25:00.541
"before the Dutch

24:58.250 --> 25:00.541
were able to capture it.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.125
"The townsfolk paid us

25:02.125 --> 25:03.333
"handsomely to dispose

25:03.333 --> 25:04.958
"of the monstrosity.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.625
"Our plan was to toss

25:04.958 --> 25:07.625
the creature

25:07.625 --> 25:09.875
into the bowels

25:07.625 --> 25:09.875
of the earth..."

25:09.875 --> 25:11.083
(whinnies)

25:14.291 --> 25:15.750
(screeching)

25:15.750 --> 25:17.625
(screaming)

25:19.250 --> 25:21.333
"After the accident,

25:21.333 --> 25:23.250

25:21.333 --> 25:23.250

25:27.250 --> 25:28.875
"Thomas deteriorated quickly.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.916
"And despite my utmost

25:30.916 --> 25:34.625
"ministrations,

25:30.916 --> 25:34.625
my brother expired.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.416
"Then a most

25:37.416 --> 25:39.500
"disturbing event occurred.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.583
Like a twisted,

25:39.500 --> 25:41.583
demonic Lazarus..."

25:44.250 --> 25:46.541
"...Thomas rose again."

25:46.541 --> 25:47.666
(screeching)

25:47.666 --> 25:49.500
"Thomas rose again"?

25:49.500 --> 25:51.541
"There is no end."

25:51.541 --> 25:53.083
That's what it said

25:51.541 --> 25:53.083
on the stones.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.833
What if that wasn't

25:53.083 --> 25:54.833
about the monster?

25:56.666 --> 25:58.750
What if that was

25:56.666 --> 25:58.750
about the victims?

26:00.375 --> 26:01.583
Robbie?

26:01.583 --> 26:03.500
(growling)

26:08.625 --> 26:10.291
(screeching)

26:24.333 --> 26:26.708
(growling)

26:46.625 --> 26:48.625
I mean, he hasn't

26:46.625 --> 26:48.625
fully transformed yet.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.375
It's the only reason why

26:48.625 --> 26:51.375
we were able to subdue him.

26:51.375 --> 26:52.458
So, he'll get stronger,

26:52.458 --> 26:53.458
which means

26:52.458 --> 26:53.458
we're running out of time.

26:53.458 --> 26:54.916
There's got to be a way

26:54.916 --> 26:55.916
to reverse this process.

26:55.916 --> 26:56.916
Not according

26:56.916 --> 26:57.916
to Dampier's journal.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.000
The villagers ended up

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
burning all the bodies.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.625
No one infected survived.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.708
I'm not giving

27:01.625 --> 27:03.708
up on him.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.708
Okay.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.583
Then what's the plan?

27:06.583 --> 27:09.375
In the Archives, there's a book.

27:09.375 --> 27:13.291
It describes a creature genus:

27:09.375 --> 27:13.291
Morphic monsters.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.958
They are...

27:14.958 --> 27:16.541
beings that transform

27:16.541 --> 27:19.125
their victims

27:16.541 --> 27:19.125
via physical infection.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.916
Like vampires.

27:20.916 --> 27:23.125
Typically,

27:20.916 --> 27:23.125
the way to cure the victim

27:23.125 --> 27:24.250
is to kill the original.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.625
Eliminate the

27:24.250 --> 27:26.625
source of infection.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.333
We destroy the  Verslinder,

27:26.625 --> 27:28.333
we save Robbie.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.416
Mm.

27:28.333 --> 27:30.416
Right.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.875
So, all we have to do

27:30.416 --> 27:33.875
is figure out how to kill

27:33.875 --> 27:36.291
an immortal slime creature

27:33.875 --> 27:36.291
with a bad case of worms.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.958
I wish we had some

27:36.291 --> 27:38.958
antibiotic cream.

27:44.166 --> 27:45.500
Antibiotics?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.625
What, you think we can defeat

27:47.625 --> 27:49.458
this thing with some penicillin?

27:53.833 --> 27:54.875
Something like that.

27:54.875 --> 27:56.916
Oh, okay.

27:56.916 --> 27:59.583
Except we are miles

27:56.916 --> 27:59.583
from the nearest drugstore.

27:59.583 --> 28:01.916
In fact, we are miles

27:59.583 --> 28:01.916
from anything.

28:01.916 --> 28:02.916
We have no weapons,

28:02.916 --> 28:04.708
no reinforcements,

28:04.708 --> 28:06.250
and no way of calling for help.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.041
In other words...

28:08.041 --> 28:09.708
should be right up my alley.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.708
You should have let me win.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.583
I have

28:18.750 --> 28:20.583
a very motivated buyer

28:20.583 --> 28:22.583
lined up for that piece,

28:20.583 --> 28:22.583
and you know

28:22.583 --> 28:24.833
how I hate to disappoint

28:22.583 --> 28:24.833
my clients.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.875
Hans, you don't know

28:24.833 --> 28:26.875
what this is.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.125
It's dangerous.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.958
I'll take the risk.

28:29.958 --> 28:30.958
All right, how much are

28:29.958 --> 28:30.958
you getting for it, man?

28:30.958 --> 28:32.583
I'll double it.

28:32.583 --> 28:34.500
Tempting...

28:34.500 --> 28:36.333
but I have my reputation

28:36.333 --> 28:37.916
to consider.

28:37.916 --> 28:38.916
Now hand it over.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.541
I suppose I should thank you

28:45.541 --> 28:47.291
for recovering my property.

28:49.750 --> 28:52.250
Return what is mine

28:49.750 --> 28:52.250
and I may spare your lives.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.291
It's funny how

28:52.250 --> 28:53.291
you always end up

28:53.291 --> 28:54.291
wanting something from me.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.541
Maybe you should take

28:55.875 --> 28:57.541
better care of your stuff.

28:57.541 --> 28:59.041
(gunshots)

29:03.250 --> 29:05.833
(choking)

29:07.333 --> 29:08.416
(door closes)

29:15.250 --> 29:17.083
You know, certain roots

29:15.250 --> 29:17.083
and herbs

29:17.083 --> 29:20.041
have natural

29:17.083 --> 29:20.041
antibiotic properties.

29:20.041 --> 29:21.541
They can be

29:20.041 --> 29:21.541
very effective

29:21.541 --> 29:23.875
in getting rid of parasites

29:21.541 --> 29:23.875
like worms.

29:23.875 --> 29:24.875
You think that will

29:23.875 --> 29:24.875
be potent enough

29:24.875 --> 29:25.916
to kill the creature?

29:25.916 --> 29:27.416
The way this thing propagates

29:27.416 --> 29:28.416
is like a...

29:28.416 --> 29:30.083
infectious disease.

29:30.083 --> 29:33.583
And unlike the Dutch

29:30.083 --> 29:33.583
at the 1600s,

29:33.583 --> 29:35.750
we know how to fight

29:33.583 --> 29:35.750
something like that.

29:35.750 --> 29:38.625
It's been a long time

29:35.750 --> 29:38.625
since I took survival training,

29:38.625 --> 29:41.458
but I am pretty sure that

29:38.625 --> 29:41.458
wasn't covered in the course.

29:41.458 --> 29:42.958
Yeah.

29:42.958 --> 29:43.958
In the Catacombs,

29:43.958 --> 29:45.250
I learned how to make

29:45.250 --> 29:46.750
my own medicine.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.750
Ah.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.750
Mm-hmm...

29:48.750 --> 29:50.166
That means it's ready.

29:50.166 --> 29:52.625
Now all we need

29:50.166 --> 29:52.625
is a delivery system.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.750
Remarkable.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.791
I'm so glad you brought

30:06.791 --> 30:09.291
this symbol

30:06.791 --> 30:09.291
to my attention, Mr. Crane.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.083
This is

30:09.291 --> 30:11.083
an incredible discovery.

30:11.083 --> 30:12.500
(muttering)

30:12.500 --> 30:13.916
A-and where did you say

30:12.500 --> 30:13.916
you found this?

30:15.083 --> 30:16.875
Oh, it's, uh...

30:16.875 --> 30:18.750
family heirloom.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.916
Passed down

30:18.750 --> 30:20.916
through generations.

30:22.833 --> 30:25.458
Well, it's unlike anything

30:22.833 --> 30:25.458
I've seen.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.916
A form of bronze,

30:25.458 --> 30:27.916
though it dates back

30:27.916 --> 30:29.375
before the Bronze Age.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.375
It's warm to the touch,

30:31.375 --> 30:32.958
almost as if

30:31.375 --> 30:32.958
it has its own power.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.458
Power?

30:35.458 --> 30:37.250
What sort of power?

30:37.250 --> 30:39.958
Might be a function

30:37.250 --> 30:39.958
of its binary nature.

30:39.958 --> 30:43.875
Oh, well, you do

30:39.958 --> 30:43.875
know it's two pieces?

30:43.875 --> 30:44.958
Uh...

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
Some metals

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
are known to pair,

30:49.500 --> 30:51.583
like poles of a magnet.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.166
When joined together,

30:51.583 --> 30:53.166
they can create energy.

30:53.166 --> 30:54.833
Never underestimate the power

30:53.166 --> 30:54.833
of a natural bond.

30:54.833 --> 30:55.833
(chuckles)

30:55.833 --> 30:57.166
(phone buzzing)

30:57.166 --> 30:58.500
Ooh, um...

31:00.583 --> 31:03.250
Excuse me.

31:03.250 --> 31:04.916
Yes.

31:13.625 --> 31:16.583
This tablet could hold

31:13.625 --> 31:16.583
the key to our mission

31:16.583 --> 31:18.000
as Witnesses.

31:57.750 --> 31:58.916
(screeching)

32:03.750 --> 32:05.666
(panting)

32:05.666 --> 32:07.541
Mr. Crane?

32:08.541 --> 32:10.500
Are you okay?

32:08.541 --> 32:10.500
Uh...

32:13.541 --> 32:15.583
My partner...

32:15.583 --> 32:17.750
she is in trouble.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.083
Your partner?

32:19.083 --> 32:20.958
Wh-Where is she?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.666
(whispering):

32:24.000 --> 32:25.666
I have no idea.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.083
Come on, Pandora can't

32:33.125 --> 32:35.083
be that far behind.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.458
We can't outrun her.

32:36.458 --> 32:38.458
She's psychically linked

32:36.458 --> 32:38.458
to that thing.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.458
Got to find a way

32:38.458 --> 32:40.458
to shield it or...

32:40.458 --> 32:41.458
(choking)

32:41.458 --> 32:42.458
Jen!

32:42.458 --> 32:43.458
Hey.

32:45.708 --> 32:47.375
Let her go!

32:47.375 --> 32:50.000
No longer will I tolerate

32:50.000 --> 32:52.666
anyone's meddling!

32:52.666 --> 32:54.666
My power is my own,

32:54.666 --> 32:56.625
and no one will take it

32:54.666 --> 32:56.625
from me ever again.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.625
(choking)

32:57.625 --> 32:58.625
(grunts)

33:01.125 --> 33:02.833
Here, take it,

33:01.125 --> 33:02.833
just let her...

33:02.833 --> 33:04.083
(grunting)

33:07.000 --> 33:08.916
(groans)

33:08.916 --> 33:11.458
(panting)

33:11.458 --> 33:13.291
(in deep voice):

33:11.458 --> 33:13.291
What's happening to me?

33:13.291 --> 33:15.375
You are a creature of darkness.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.625
(screams)

33:17.625 --> 33:19.000
(snarling)

33:19.000 --> 33:21.708
You have been hiding it

33:19.000 --> 33:21.708
from yourself,

33:21.708 --> 33:24.083
but you cannot hide it

33:21.708 --> 33:24.083
from the Box.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.000
This is your true form.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.833
No!

33:29.583 --> 33:31.250
(screams)

33:31.250 --> 33:32.291
(shouts)

33:32.291 --> 33:33.500
(roaring)

33:33.500 --> 33:35.125
(coughing)

33:37.250 --> 33:39.666
Joe!

33:37.250 --> 33:39.666
(grunts)

33:41.625 --> 33:42.750
Joe...

33:42.750 --> 33:44.083
Joe!

33:44.083 --> 33:45.083
Joe.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.625
(groans)

33:46.625 --> 33:47.625
Hey, hey.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.083
Go away.

33:49.083 --> 33:50.875
No. Not a chance.

34:15.541 --> 34:16.791
Look...

34:16.791 --> 34:18.041
both times it attacked,

34:16.791 --> 34:18.041
it waited

34:18.041 --> 34:20.000
until its target was isolated.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.458
Okay, so we split up.

34:22.458 --> 34:23.458
You go north.

34:23.458 --> 34:24.458
You encounter it,

34:24.458 --> 34:26.041
you call me.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.041
All right.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.625
Trust me, if I find it,

34:26.041 --> 34:27.625
you'll hear me.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.875
(whispering):

34:30.750 --> 34:32.875
Quick and nimble.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.875
Quick and nimble.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.375
(sighs)

34:36.375 --> 34:37.541
Quick and nimble...

34:37.541 --> 34:40.208
(faintly):

34:37.541 --> 34:40.208
Quick and nimble.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.541
(screeching)

34:52.458 --> 34:54.708
(screeching)

34:57.875 --> 34:59.750
(screeching)

35:00.625 --> 35:02.666
(grunts)

35:05.625 --> 35:06.791
Sophie!

35:06.791 --> 35:08.458
He's heading your way!

35:12.208 --> 35:13.291
(screeching)

35:16.958 --> 35:18.833
I lost it!

35:22.500 --> 35:24.333
(screeching)

35:33.666 --> 35:34.875
(screeching continues)

35:38.083 --> 35:39.583
(gunshot)

36:02.208 --> 36:03.458
Well...

36:05.166 --> 36:08.250
The answer to this might

36:05.166 --> 36:08.250
be self-evident, but...

36:08.250 --> 36:10.541
how is your survival exercise?

36:10.541 --> 36:13.125
We survived.

36:14.833 --> 36:17.583
So, you could see me

36:14.833 --> 36:17.583
just by touching the symbol?

36:17.583 --> 36:19.333
Not only that, I could

36:17.583 --> 36:19.333
feel your presence,

36:19.333 --> 36:20.750
as if I were in

36:19.333 --> 36:20.750
the very room with you.

36:20.750 --> 36:21.916
And that's how you found us?

36:21.916 --> 36:23.541
No, once I saw

36:21.916 --> 36:23.541
you in peril,

36:23.541 --> 36:26.000
I needed to determine

36:23.541 --> 36:26.000
a way to locate you.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.958
Fortunately, I had taken

36:27.958 --> 36:30.000
several artifacts

36:27.958 --> 36:30.000
to the doctor's laboratory,

36:30.000 --> 36:31.250
including...

36:31.250 --> 36:33.333
The Blavatsky Map.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.000
Able to track

36:33.333 --> 36:36.000
demonic presence.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.833
I simply followed it

36:36.000 --> 36:37.833
to the creature

36:37.833 --> 36:39.875
that bedeviled you.

36:41.375 --> 36:42.500
Crane...

36:42.500 --> 36:43.625
if the symbol works

36:43.625 --> 36:45.208
with the tablet of Witnesses,

36:45.208 --> 36:47.791
and it was able to help you...

36:47.791 --> 36:50.500
Then it may not be

36:47.791 --> 36:50.500
an implement of evil.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.041
It may be a tool

36:50.500 --> 36:53.041
for our cause.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.750
A very powerful tool.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.125
The symbol is not evil.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.083
SOPHIE:

36:57.708 --> 36:59.083
Hey...

36:59.083 --> 37:01.041
Robbie's a lot better.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.041
No more worms.

37:01.041 --> 37:02.500
Oh, good, I'm sure

37:02.500 --> 37:04.208
he'll be very grateful

37:02.500 --> 37:04.208
for your help.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.375
Yeah.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.125
I'll go get our gear.

37:07.125 --> 37:08.500
Hey, um...

37:08.500 --> 37:10.750
you were right about something.

37:10.750 --> 37:13.583
Um... supernatural

37:13.583 --> 37:16.666
brought a lot of good people

37:13.583 --> 37:16.666
into my life.

37:16.666 --> 37:17.958
And I don't just mean Crane.

37:20.541 --> 37:22.625
Thanks.

37:23.625 --> 37:25.708
(sighs)

37:32.500 --> 37:34.666
Lieutenant?

37:34.666 --> 37:35.791
Are you all right?

37:35.791 --> 37:38.750
It's the symbol, Crane.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.208
This whole time I thought

37:40.208 --> 37:43.041
I was succumbing

37:40.208 --> 37:43.041
to darkness, and...

37:43.041 --> 37:45.041
it's not at all

37:43.041 --> 37:45.041
what we thought it was.

37:45.041 --> 37:47.250
I know, it is confusing.

37:47.250 --> 37:50.666
We thought the symbol

37:47.250 --> 37:50.666
was tormenting you,

37:50.666 --> 37:53.666
when, in fact,

37:50.666 --> 37:53.666
it was here to help us.

37:53.666 --> 37:55.166
But...

37:55.166 --> 37:56.291
'tis an invaluable lesson.

37:57.916 --> 38:00.083
Sometimes the things

37:57.916 --> 38:00.083
we think will hurt us

38:00.083 --> 38:03.250
will actually save us.

38:16.958 --> 38:18.875
Thanks.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.416
You are welcome.

38:20.416 --> 38:23.125
Hospital called,

38:20.416 --> 38:23.125
says Robbie's gonna be fine.

38:23.125 --> 38:24.500
He doesn't remember much,

38:24.500 --> 38:25.625
which is probably

38:24.500 --> 38:25.625
for the best.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.416
You and Foster did a great job

38:27.416 --> 38:29.000
keeping him alive.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.208
You made the right call

38:29.000 --> 38:32.208
in going for help.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.166
Danny... (sighs)

38:39.166 --> 38:40.958
I did a lot of thinking

38:39.166 --> 38:40.958
when I was away.

38:40.958 --> 38:43.791
I came to see

38:43.791 --> 38:46.458
that there are things

38:43.791 --> 38:46.458
missing in my life.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.625
I got friends and family,

38:47.625 --> 38:49.916
you know,

38:47.625 --> 38:49.916
but I don't have, like...

38:49.916 --> 38:52.458
what we had...

38:52.458 --> 38:54.458
and because of the way

38:52.458 --> 38:54.458
that my life is,

38:54.458 --> 38:56.958
I may never have that...

38:56.958 --> 38:59.500
and figuring that out is scary.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.166
And having

38:59.500 --> 39:02.166
this conversation...

39:02.166 --> 39:04.291
is scary.

39:04.291 --> 39:07.833
So, I'm gonna tell you

39:04.291 --> 39:07.833
that I...

39:07.833 --> 39:10.875
don't think of us

39:10.875 --> 39:13.666
as something in the past tense.

39:13.666 --> 39:15.291
And I never will.

39:17.416 --> 39:19.250
Thank you for telling me

39:17.416 --> 39:19.250
the truth.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.125
The truth...

39:23.458 --> 39:24.750
For the longest time,

39:24.750 --> 39:26.375
I thought that

39:24.750 --> 39:26.375
the truth was dangerous,

39:26.375 --> 39:27.875
and it still can be, but...

39:27.875 --> 39:30.375
now I'm starting

39:27.875 --> 39:30.375
to know that

39:30.375 --> 39:33.500
the thing that we think will

39:30.375 --> 39:33.500
hurt us may actually save us.

39:47.541 --> 39:48.666
Where'd you put it?

39:48.666 --> 39:50.125
Somewhere safe.

39:50.125 --> 39:51.208
Neither you nor Pandora

39:51.208 --> 39:52.208
should be able to sense it.

39:52.208 --> 39:53.833
(sighs)

39:53.833 --> 39:55.916
We should have

39:53.833 --> 39:55.916
seen this coming.

39:55.916 --> 39:59.375
Pandora's box summons monsters,

39:55.916 --> 39:59.375
and I'm a monster.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.666
You are not a monster.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.083
As long as we keep you

40:01.666 --> 40:03.083
away from that Box...

40:03.083 --> 40:04.541
No, that Box

40:03.083 --> 40:04.541
isn't the problem.

40:04.541 --> 40:06.458
The problem is that

40:04.541 --> 40:06.458
the Wendigo is still

40:06.458 --> 40:08.166
inside me.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.416
You could get hurt.

40:09.416 --> 40:10.875
Hey, no, no, no,

40:09.416 --> 40:10.875
that's not gonna happen.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.000
Okay?

40:12.000 --> 40:14.458
Remember, you're in control.

40:14.458 --> 40:15.458
You.

40:15.458 --> 40:18.500
Joe Corbin.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.666
And Joe Corbin is someone

40:18.500 --> 40:21.666
I trust with my life.

40:24.416 --> 40:26.916
HIDDEN ONE: They dared to lay

40:24.416 --> 40:26.916
a hand upon you?

40:26.916 --> 40:28.541
The humans?

40:28.541 --> 40:30.750
He was not human.

40:30.750 --> 40:33.250
He had seeds of darkness

40:30.750 --> 40:33.250
within him.

40:33.250 --> 40:34.958
He is a creature of chaos.

40:34.958 --> 40:38.208
I thought their kind

40:34.958 --> 40:38.208
heeded your word.

40:40.208 --> 40:43.541
Only when my Box and power

40:40.208 --> 40:43.541
are complete.

40:43.541 --> 40:47.875
My abilities

40:43.541 --> 40:47.875
are at a low ebb.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.500
This situation

40:47.875 --> 40:49.500
must be addressed.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
(whispering):

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
Yes.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.916
Yes.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.750
(sighs)

40:58.750 --> 41:01.291
I must destroy the Witnesses.

41:04.791 --> 41:06.208
My love?

41:06.208 --> 41:08.958
Your failure has made

41:06.208 --> 41:08.958
my path clear.

41:08.958 --> 41:11.666
You let the mortals

41:08.958 --> 41:11.666
get the better of you

41:11.666 --> 41:12.708
at every turn.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.208
So now, I must do

41:16.208 --> 41:18.208
what should have been

41:16.208 --> 41:18.208
done long ago.
