17:33.707 --> 17:35.708
I wasn't in time.

17:35.743 --> 17:37.510
It's all my fault.

17:37.545 --> 17:38.912
She's in shock.

17:38.946 --> 17:40.547
We need to get her
back to the hospital.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.948
<i>They're telling me</i>
<i>she never even checked out.</i>

17:41.982 --> 17:44.450
I'm not going back
to the hospital.

17:44.484 --> 17:47.352
It's okay, Deputy.
I'll take it from here.

17:51.023 --> 17:52.766
It just doesn't add up.

17:52.791 --> 17:53.892
Yeah, just give me a few
minutes with her.

17:53.893 --> 17:56.094
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:56.129 --> 17:58.163
- You okay?
- It was Rabbit.

17:58.197 --> 18:00.366
He was right there
on the playground.

18:00.391 --> 18:01.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:01.001 --> 18:02.264
He's not gonna hurt him.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.703
- He's not gonna hurt Max.
- You don't know that.

18:03.704 --> 18:05.238
He's using him as bait
to get to you and me.

18:05.272 --> 18:07.073
- That's what he wants.
- He's gonna kill all of us.

18:07.107 --> 18:08.375
He's not gonna kill anyone.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.121
You have no idea what
he will or will not do!

18:15.783 --> 18:18.184
I won't let anything
happen to your family.

18:18.218 --> 18:20.986
I promise.
I'll find Rabbit.

18:21.021 --> 18:24.189
You don't have to.
He's already found you.

18:32.466 --> 18:34.433
Emmett, will you keep
an eye on Deva for me?

18:34.468 --> 18:35.702
Sure, Gordon.

18:35.736 --> 18:37.638
I mean it. Do not let her
out of your sight.

18:37.672 --> 18:39.306
Understood.

18:41.110 --> 18:43.546
I want to talk
to my wife alone.

18:45.016 --> 18:46.452
Get the fuck out!

18:55.506 --> 18:57.511
Gordon:
<i>Who has our son, Carrie?</i>

19:01.019 --> 19:03.645
Carrie:
<i>My father.</i>

19:05.182 --> 19:07.853
Your father?

19:09.622 --> 19:12.657
You mean the one that died
when you were 13?

19:12.691 --> 19:14.292
That father?

19:17.963 --> 19:19.997
Yes.

19:27.507 --> 19:30.543
Jesus Christ.
Sheriff Hood.

19:30.577 --> 19:32.445
What the hell
happened to her?

19:34.681 --> 19:38.316
Mrs. Hopewell-- she was
attacked yesterday.

19:38.350 --> 19:40.118
And now they've
grabbed her son.

19:40.153 --> 19:43.155
And she was the one who was
assaulted by those bikers

19:43.189 --> 19:44.890
- a few weeks ago, wasn't she?
- Yes.

19:44.924 --> 19:47.827
Has it occurred to anyone else here
that Mrs. Hopewell

19:47.862 --> 19:50.701
is far and away the unluckiest woman
in the state of Pennsylvania?

19:50.736 --> 19:52.707
Obviously she's mixed up
in something.

19:52.741 --> 19:54.578
You think?

19:54.613 --> 19:56.983
Did she get a look
at whoever took the boy?

19:58.553 --> 20:01.589
She may have.
She's still very upset.

20:03.191 --> 20:04.692
But the teacher,

20:04.726 --> 20:07.895
she saw an older man
in a dark suit.

20:07.929 --> 20:10.331
All right, I want a sketch
artist here within the hour.

20:10.365 --> 20:11.999
And if they can't get
anyone local,

20:12.034 --> 20:13.914
get somebody on a goddamn
chopper from Quantico.

20:13.935 --> 20:15.402
Do you have anything
else for me?

20:15.437 --> 20:17.071
- We're just getting into it.
- Yeah.

20:17.105 --> 20:19.273
Deputies, could I have
your attention, please?

20:19.307 --> 20:22.577
As of right now, this is officially
a federal investigation.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.785
You will all brief
Agents Carlson and McAvoy

20:25.819 --> 20:27.722
on any interviews that
you've conducted thus far

20:27.757 --> 20:30.225
as well as any and all evidence
gathered at the scene.

20:30.259 --> 20:32.260
I've got a team
on the way here from DC,

20:32.294 --> 20:35.364
but until they arrive, you will
be assisting us with the legwork.

20:35.398 --> 20:37.533
This is a felony
kidnapping.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.403
It is federal by a mile,
so do not fuck with me.

20:40.437 --> 20:43.574
Until the boy is sleeping
in his bed again,

20:43.609 --> 20:46.911
everyone in this room
works for me.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.680
Do you understand?

20:51.551 --> 20:53.051
Okay.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.721
I'm gonna go in
and talk to the mother now.

21:14.574 --> 21:18.409
<i>( tools buzzing,</i>
<i>hammering )</i>

21:21.413 --> 21:25.013
As you can see, we haven't
wasted any time getting to work.

21:25.048 --> 21:28.316
At our current pace, we're
looking at a grand opening

21:28.350 --> 21:30.250
a month ahead of schedule.

21:30.284 --> 21:32.718
And my people are working closely
with the gaming commission

21:32.752 --> 21:34.519
to ensure that our licensing
is in order by then.

21:34.554 --> 21:38.122
Afternoon, gentlemen.
I hope you like what you see.

21:38.156 --> 21:40.257
Excuse me a minute.

21:42.393 --> 21:44.995
Proctor.

21:46.398 --> 21:47.832
This is coming up nicely.

21:47.866 --> 21:50.434
And ahead of schedule.

21:50.468 --> 21:53.269
Oh, let me introduce my niece.
This is Rebecca Bowman.

21:53.304 --> 21:54.971
She'll be sitting in,
learning the business.

21:55.005 --> 21:57.406
And this is
Alex Longshadow.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.340
Sorry, this is
Chief Alex Longshadow.

22:00.375 --> 22:03.176
He is the leader
of the Kinaho tribal council.

22:03.211 --> 22:05.645
What are you doing here,
Proctor?

22:05.680 --> 22:07.481
I thought you said
you had a meeting.

22:07.515 --> 22:08.849
Oh, we do.

22:08.884 --> 22:11.285
It's just that Alex here
forgot to mention to me

22:11.319 --> 22:13.720
that he was bringing in
a new round

22:13.754 --> 22:16.089
of potential investors
for our project.

22:17.658 --> 22:19.225
I don't take that
personally.

22:19.259 --> 22:22.328
It's just there's a give-and-take
in every partnership.

22:23.630 --> 22:25.098
We're not partners.

22:25.132 --> 22:27.433
<i>I don't know how to make that</i>
<i>any more clear to you</i>

22:27.467 --> 22:28.667
<i>than I already have.</i>

22:28.702 --> 22:31.403
Now I'm gonna ask you
one last time

22:31.437 --> 22:33.204
to stay out
of the tribe's business

22:33.239 --> 22:35.707
and then I'm going
to stop being polite.

22:38.143 --> 22:39.910
Listen to his tone.

22:39.945 --> 22:41.946
Look at his posture.

22:41.981 --> 22:45.350
How certain he is he is the one
with all the power here.

22:52.158 --> 22:53.691
Get out now.

22:53.726 --> 22:56.927
Your father and I
had a deal, Alex.

22:56.962 --> 22:58.963
You didn't like it,
I know that.

22:58.998 --> 23:02.543
But you inherited it
just like you inherited all this.

23:02.577 --> 23:04.950
Now the smart thing
for you to do--

23:04.985 --> 23:07.953
no, the only thing
for you to do

23:07.988 --> 23:09.889
- is to honor that deal.
- ( chuckles )

23:09.923 --> 23:12.926
If you continue to think you can break
your father's promises,

23:12.961 --> 23:15.763
you may cause me
to rethink my own terms.

23:18.967 --> 23:20.434
You know what this is?

23:22.804 --> 23:24.304
It's a whistle.

23:24.339 --> 23:27.374
It's a lesson
in power.

23:27.408 --> 23:29.609
( blows )

23:29.644 --> 23:31.778
- <i>( air horn blows )</i>
- <i>( construction stops )</i>

23:31.812 --> 23:35.215
Let's go.
We're done.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.208
Very nice to meet you.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.255
That was fun.

24:13.290 --> 24:15.191
That was a waste
of our time.

24:15.226 --> 24:17.327
I need
those workers working.

24:17.361 --> 24:18.996
Then why did you do it?

24:21.132 --> 24:24.034
Because I promised his father
I wouldn't kill him.

24:32.145 --> 24:34.446
( coughing, wheezing )

24:42.388 --> 24:43.789
( inhales )

24:43.823 --> 24:46.592
Hey, Max.
You are okay?

24:46.627 --> 24:49.930
Just let me go home.
I want to see my mom.

25:00.675 --> 25:03.677
Hey.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.180
You don't have
to be scared of me.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.685
I would never hurt you.

25:11.888 --> 25:13.422
I just want to go home.

25:13.456 --> 25:16.459
( coughing )

25:20.489 --> 25:22.591
What is it?
What's wrong?

25:22.625 --> 25:24.894
I can't breathe.

25:24.929 --> 25:26.930
I need my nebulizer.

25:26.965 --> 25:29.667
( coughing )

25:30.903 --> 25:33.438
Just calm down.
Take a deep breath.

25:33.473 --> 25:36.242
I can't.

25:36.276 --> 25:37.410
I have asthma.

25:37.444 --> 25:39.879
( coughing )

25:52.554 --> 25:54.715
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

26:03.753 --> 26:05.554
Door was unlocked.

26:05.588 --> 26:07.922
No it wasn't.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.575
I, uh...

26:28.609 --> 26:30.710
I need your help.

26:33.114 --> 26:34.948
You want my help?

26:34.982 --> 26:36.783
Yeah.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.754
First I have to
ask you something.

26:42.190 --> 26:45.593
The Amish girl,
Rebecca--

26:45.627 --> 26:47.528
did you fuck her?

26:49.064 --> 26:51.065
What's that got to do
with anything?

26:51.099 --> 26:53.100
She's my niece.

26:53.135 --> 26:55.303
( sighs )

26:55.337 --> 26:57.071
Small fucking towns.

26:57.106 --> 26:59.040
- So that's a yes.
- Yeah, I didn't know she--

26:59.074 --> 27:01.575
( grunts )
Hang on.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.548
I said hang on.

27:43.983 --> 27:45.917
( groans )

27:51.723 --> 27:54.058
( both groaning )

27:58.062 --> 27:59.863
You had enough?

28:01.231 --> 28:03.165
( spits )

28:07.837 --> 28:09.371
( machine humming )

28:45.802 --> 28:47.970
( shouts )

29:26.115 --> 29:29.117
- ( Lucas panting )
- ( Kai groans )

29:42.299 --> 29:43.565
I think I've had enough.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.834
( panting )

29:49.873 --> 29:51.944
Good.

30:09.913 --> 30:12.548
So what did you want
to talk about?

30:15.953 --> 30:19.589
There's some men in town.

30:19.623 --> 30:22.191
They came here for me.

30:23.494 --> 30:25.128
Seems to me
I'd be better off

30:25.163 --> 30:26.864
letting these men have
what they came for.

30:26.898 --> 30:28.966
No.

30:29.001 --> 30:31.402
You're too smart for that.

30:31.437 --> 30:33.271
Why's that?

30:34.240 --> 30:36.775
Because I'll owe you one.

30:39.645 --> 30:41.446
Huh.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.329
One thing.

30:58.532 --> 31:01.768
Rebecca--
she's off-limits.

31:05.006 --> 31:07.641
- Deal.
- It's not a deal.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.243
It's a fact.

31:22.691 --> 31:27.461
<i>♪ Was I too dumb</i>
<i>to notice ♪</i>

31:29.798 --> 31:34.302
<i>♪ The pale light</i>
<i>in your eyes? ♪</i>

31:37.204 --> 31:41.769
<i>♪ Was I too distracted? ♪</i>

31:44.940 --> 31:48.276
<i>♪ Did I turn away? ♪</i>

31:52.080 --> 31:56.917
<i>♪ I can't exactly say... ♪</i>

32:27.989 --> 32:31.293
So how long have you had that
stuff buried in our backyard?

32:38.067 --> 32:40.235
There's things you don't
know about me, Gordon.

32:40.269 --> 32:43.105
I'm sorry.
Things from my past.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.741
Yeah, but you were
holding that gun today.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.682
Gordon, I love you...

32:56.120 --> 32:58.489
but I can't do this now.

32:58.523 --> 32:59.857
Max needs me.

32:59.891 --> 33:01.592
Is anything about us true?
About you?

33:01.626 --> 33:03.894
Is Carrie even
your real name?

33:06.565 --> 33:08.666
Not now.

33:12.938 --> 33:14.205
Shit.

33:26.253 --> 33:27.887
Ah, here she is.

33:27.921 --> 33:29.689
( Deva gasps )

33:29.723 --> 33:32.324
I bet you didn't know your mother
could handle a gun, did you?

33:32.359 --> 33:36.161
She was just about your age
when I taught her.

33:36.195 --> 33:37.929
Go upstairs, baby.

33:37.963 --> 33:40.732
No. Stay here.

33:40.766 --> 33:42.467
Leave her out of this.

33:42.501 --> 33:44.636
Put the gun down.

33:44.670 --> 33:47.171
( speaks Ukrainian )

34:08.126 --> 34:09.659
Deva,

34:09.694 --> 34:12.295
how old are you?

34:12.331 --> 34:14.399
I'm 15.

34:15.534 --> 34:18.402
- 15.
- Please don't.

34:18.437 --> 34:19.904
Who are you?

34:21.172 --> 34:22.574
I'm your grandfather.

34:22.641 --> 34:24.542
My grandfather is dead.

34:24.577 --> 34:26.244
No.

34:26.279 --> 34:27.879
Not yet.

34:30.248 --> 34:32.617
Deva.

34:39.391 --> 34:41.493
Is this him?

34:43.228 --> 34:45.429
- Dad!
- Carrie: <i>Gordon, no! Gordon!</i>

34:45.464 --> 34:48.632
You tell me where my son is,
you son of a bitch.

34:49.969 --> 34:52.136
Your son is missing
for five hours

34:52.170 --> 34:54.304
and you are angry
and terrified.

34:54.340 --> 34:58.308
My daughter was gone
for 15 years.

34:58.343 --> 35:00.409
Get Deva out of here.

35:00.444 --> 35:03.909
Gordon. Gordon.

35:03.944 --> 35:08.038
If you shoot him,
his men will slit Max's throat.

35:13.394 --> 35:15.558
- ( Deva gasps )
- Carrie: <i>No!</i>

35:16.990 --> 35:20.688
Is that any way to greet
your father-in-law, Gordon?

35:20.723 --> 35:24.115
Please.
Please don't hurt my father.

35:25.513 --> 35:28.237
This is not your father.

35:29.202 --> 35:31.396
Please, don't.

35:41.935 --> 35:43.331
Okay.

35:43.365 --> 35:45.958
Please,

35:45.992 --> 35:49.886
can we all just sit down?

35:54.333 --> 35:56.155
Like a family.

36:11.183 --> 36:14.869
- Um, my brother Max--
- All in good time.

36:18.728 --> 36:22.855
Your mother has told you
many lies, Deva.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.920
And I think maybe she lied

36:24.955 --> 36:27.353
<i>to your stepfather, too.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:30.219 --> 36:31.685
Look, you see?

36:31.719 --> 36:34.949
Look at her face.
It's true.

36:36.651 --> 36:38.649
- Mom?
- I'm sorry.

36:38.684 --> 36:41.614
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

36:44.213 --> 36:47.411
Deva, your brother
has a breathing machine.

36:47.445 --> 36:49.710
- His nebulizer.
- Yes.

36:49.745 --> 36:51.743
Go get it for me, please.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.208
Is he having attacks?

36:56.108 --> 36:57.507
He could die.

36:57.541 --> 36:59.773
Then you'd better hurry.

37:12.234 --> 37:13.599
( speaking Ukrainian )

37:39.054 --> 37:41.519
Anastasia.

37:45.951 --> 37:49.082
Where is Olek?

38:11.780 --> 38:14.378
Let me come with you.
I can take care of him.

38:14.412 --> 38:16.709
You're such a sweet girl.

38:20.239 --> 38:22.303
I will see you again.

38:22.338 --> 38:24.268
( chuckles )

38:31.989 --> 38:33.885
Hey.

38:35.884 --> 38:38.282
I'm gonna kill you.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.907
You already have.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.887
<i>( car leaves )</i>

39:10.899 --> 39:13.368
<i>( slot machines chiming )</i>

39:13.403 --> 39:15.838
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

39:17.074 --> 39:19.905
- Alex: <i>Jeffrey Thompson.</i>
- Yeah?

39:19.939 --> 39:22.541
You're a big fucking guy

39:22.575 --> 39:25.787
with a big fucking
gambling problem.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.828
Rick knows I'm good
for the money.

39:33.845 --> 39:37.488
<i>Rick works for me</i>
<i>and it's not his call.</i>

39:37.523 --> 39:39.528
That money belongs
to the Kinaho tribe

39:39.563 --> 39:41.336
and it's my job
to safeguard that money.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.845
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

39:46.382 --> 39:48.856
You're into us
for 46 grand.

39:48.890 --> 39:50.627
Yeah, I know.

39:50.662 --> 39:52.170
I made some calls.

39:52.204 --> 39:54.346
Ours is not the only
casino you play in.

39:54.381 --> 39:56.991
You're into Fox Valley
for 60 grand.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.302
Those guys are
some tough bastards.

40:00.336 --> 40:02.473
I don't see how that's
any concern of yours.

40:02.507 --> 40:05.279
It's not, but we have
a working relationship.

40:05.314 --> 40:07.890
<i>See, we do</i>
<i>each other favors.</i>

40:07.924 --> 40:10.496
I could wipe
your slate clean.

40:10.531 --> 40:12.403
And why would you
want to do that?

40:15.851 --> 40:17.720
You used to work
for Kai Proctor, right?

40:17.755 --> 40:20.358
- Yeah.
- <i>What happened?</i>

40:20.392 --> 40:22.526
Let's just say
we parted ways.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.194
I heard he fired you.

40:26.197 --> 40:28.530
Just when you were
paying off your debt, too.

40:34.535 --> 40:36.935
All right, look,

40:36.969 --> 40:40.337
you know you have me
and I know you have me.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.440
So just tell me
what the plan is.

40:43.474 --> 40:45.608
( laughs )

40:47.410 --> 40:49.643
I like where
your head's at, Jeffrey.

41:08.487 --> 41:10.520
You look like shit.

41:12.122 --> 41:13.689
Long day.

41:15.558 --> 41:17.658
You know,

41:17.693 --> 41:20.991
sometimes you spend so long
waiting for something,

41:21.025 --> 41:24.794
it simply can't measure up
to your expectations.

41:24.828 --> 41:27.128
So maybe you should
just go home, huh?

41:27.163 --> 41:28.996
( chuckles )

41:30.699 --> 41:33.399
So you're a pretend
policeman now?

41:33.434 --> 41:36.100
Inspired, but stupid.

41:36.135 --> 41:38.268
This was always
the way with you--

41:38.336 --> 41:42.504
<i>always in the moment,</i>
<i>blind to the consequences.</i>

41:42.538 --> 41:45.339
You'd make a terrible
chess player.

41:45.373 --> 41:48.742
Is this your plan?
To insult me to death?

41:50.144 --> 41:54.316
You spent all those years
locked up with animals.

41:54.350 --> 41:56.257
<i>Then you come here</i>

41:56.291 --> 41:58.432
<i>only to find she's married</i>

41:58.467 --> 42:01.369
with a family.

42:02.905 --> 42:04.806
Where's the boy, Rabbit?

42:04.840 --> 42:07.377
You can't help him.

42:07.411 --> 42:09.846
You're gonna kill
a little boy?

42:09.881 --> 42:11.715
Is that gonna
satisfy you?

42:11.750 --> 42:14.419
That's not
your concern anymore.

42:16.522 --> 42:20.226
Are you going
to shoot me or what?

42:20.260 --> 42:21.727
I'm considering it.

42:21.761 --> 42:23.796
Well, decide quickly.

42:27.368 --> 42:29.437
No?

42:34.816 --> 42:36.617
Okay.

42:41.595 --> 42:42.928
What do you want, Rabbit?

42:42.963 --> 42:45.832
I just wanted to look
into your eyes

42:45.867 --> 42:48.601
for the last time.

42:48.636 --> 42:51.405
To be the last face
you ever saw.

43:03.023 --> 43:05.058
Good-bye.

43:28.684 --> 43:30.117
