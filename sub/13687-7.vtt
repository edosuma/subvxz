07:51.204 --> 07:53.272
{\an1}So Corey's not
confusing things for you?

07:53.339 --> 07:56.275
{\an5}Um, I just don't think
it's gonna work between
me and him.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.711
{\an1}Nicole, how are things
with you and Chad?

07:58.778 --> 08:01.347
{\an5}We're good.
I feel like you're gonna
(bleep) it up though,

08:01.414 --> 08:03.216
so bring on the exes.

By the end of this
whole experience,

08:04.750 --> 08:06.986
some of you may find new love,

rekindle with an old love,
or just say (bleep) love.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.559
But the real question:
Are you completely over your ex?

08:13.626 --> 08:16.362
It's time.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.362
{\an3}No.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.297
Let's bring 'em out.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.365
(bleep).

08:23.236 --> 08:26.072
{\an8}My ex coming in?
Like, he doesn't need
to be here.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.941
{\an8}Just throw him back
in the water.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.943
{\an8}It's like, how much more
can I take?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.111
{\an8}I haven't cracked yet,
but I feel like if an ex

08:33.179 --> 08:36.381
{\an8}comes out of the water,
I might reach my cracking point.

{\an1}What happened between
y'all two?

09:35.508 --> 09:37.243
I ended up moving
to Los Angeles.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.879
{\an5}It was too much
of long distance
got in the way and--

09:39.946 --> 09:43.349
{\an5}So you left him hanging?

09:51.157 --> 09:52.692
Yeah, I'm flustered
because I'm already living

09:52.758 --> 09:55.561
{\an5}with two exes,
and now you're
tossing in a third.

{\an1}Even from the other ones,
I'm feeling something.

10:00.967 --> 10:04.303
{\an5}I think there is
a genuine connection,
but it's difficult

10:04.370 --> 10:07.173
because I got some issues
back at the house.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.175

of this house, and he's honestly
pretty boring.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.929
{\an7}Jay came in the house.
I kind of rekindled things
with him.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.665
{\an7}Then Corey came in,
so it was kind of like...

11:03.996 --> 11:06.665
{\an5}Double whammy.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.801
{\an7}...a weird messy

figured out till you
walked up on the beach.

{\an8}Me and Monte had a great
relationship before this.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.610
{\an8}It didn't end badly.
My family loves him.

11:17.676 --> 11:21.080
{\an8}He's unfortunately the exact
kind of guy that my dad

11:21.147 --> 11:23.182

Everything happens

13:56.368 --> 13:57.870
What's up?

13:57.937 --> 14:02.975
{\an8}So I've had a night
to cool down, relax.

14:03.042 --> 14:06.445
{\an8}Going in the house, for me,
it is stressful

14:06.512 --> 14:08.147
{\an8}because I'm dealing
with the fact

14:08.214 --> 14:11.784
{\an8}that I really am, like,
heartbroken for real.

14:11.850 --> 14:14.520
{\an8}Diandra, can I talk to you?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.520
{\an7}Yes.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.956
{\an8}My main point
to pull Diandra aside

14:17.022 --> 14:19.625
{\an8}was to apologize to her
and let her know that, hey,

14:19.692 --> 14:21.293
{\an8}I know we've had our beefs
in the past.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.896
{\an8}Like, I know we personally
don't care for each other,

14:23.963 --> 14:28.000
{\an8}but the attack I made on her
was not personal at all.

14:31.937 --> 14:36.108
{\an4}So basically I just wanted
to genuinely apologize
for putting my hands on you.

14:36.175 --> 14:42.181
{\an5}Like, my issues are with him.
Like, I should conduct myself
better just as a human being.

14:42.248 --> 14:45.317
You (bleep) kiss her?!
You're gonna kiss her?!

14:45.384 --> 14:46.719
That is her ex.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.721
Oh, (bleep).
Oh, you ain't tell me that.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.055
{\an1}(bleep) you laughing,
bitch?!

14:50.122 --> 14:52.658
{\an5}Janelle! Janelle! Janelle!

14:50.122 --> 14:52.658
You (bleep)hole!

14:52.725 --> 14:55.361
{\an5}So I apologize.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.361
I accept your apology.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.296
Um, I wasn't
laughing at you.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.832
{\an5}Like, I'm sorry.
Like, when I get nervous,
I'm like...

14:59.898 --> 15:02.134
(nervous chuckle)
But I literally--

15:02.201 --> 15:04.503
all I said, I looked back,
like, this is crazy.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.940
{\an5}And thankful that you came
to apologize for putting
your hands on me.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.342
{\an4}No problem.
Like, I meant it, but I
shouldn't be hitting people.

15:10.409 --> 15:15.014
{\an8}I saw Janelle go up to Diandra,
apologize for the whole thing,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.750
{\an8}argument they had,
and just literally broke down.

15:17.816 --> 15:21.720
{\an8}And you know what?
It takes a grown person
to apologize and to admit that.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.355
{\an8}I accept your apology.

15:23.422 --> 15:28.227
{\an8}With me, if someone says sorry
and they genuinely mean it,

15:28.294 --> 15:29.628
{\an8}I will forgive you.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.531
{\an8}Will I forget?
No. I'm not stupid.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.066
{\an8}I will definitely keep
my eyes up open,

15:34.133 --> 15:37.269
{\an8}but the minute you say sorry,
all right, clean slate.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.039
{\an8}I'ma do a handshake.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.039
{\an9}Okay.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.173
We'll take it slow.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.173
{\an1}Yes.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.342
{\an5}Okay. Okay, thank you.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.342
All right.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.145
{\an5}(announcer)
Now that Janelle and Diandra are
on the same page,

15:46.211 --> 15:49.114
the house vibes seem to be
in a good place.

15:49.181 --> 15:52.685
Maybe Farrah and Nurys
can squash their beef too?

15:54.253 --> 15:56.488
Hello, house.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.556
Hey, Farrah.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.824
Hello.

15:58.891 --> 16:00.225
There's another one.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.127
So I'm back today
and I'm going in the house

16:02.194 --> 16:05.097
{\an8}and I'm just staying away
from literally everything,

16:05.164 --> 16:07.499
{\an8}everyone, and (bleep) them.

16:07.566 --> 16:08.867
{\an5}Aww.

16:07.566 --> 16:08.867
Have a drink.

16:11.970 --> 16:15.107
I'm back.
I'm back.

16:15.174 --> 16:18.410
(screaming)

16:18.477 --> 16:20.479
(laughter)

16:20.546 --> 16:23.248
{\an8}I'm extremely happy
that Nurys came back here.

16:23.315 --> 16:27.086
{\an8}She did nothing wrong,
but I understand as to why
she had to leave.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.456
{\an8}But I am genuinely upset
that Farrah is still here.

16:30.522 --> 16:34.093
{\an8}I'm gonna go ahead and leave it
in the fate of the Lord

16:34.159 --> 16:36.428
{\an8}and He will take care of that.
Karma's a bitch.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.931
(indistinct chatter)

16:38.997 --> 16:41.800
{\an5}Good.

16:38.997 --> 16:41.800
So if I started talking
to another girl,

16:41.867 --> 16:42.968
{\an5}she'd probably find out.

16:41.867 --> 16:42.968
Hey, can we talk?

16:43.035 --> 16:44.603
Hi, how are you?
Sure.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.205
{\an5}In private?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.205
Okay.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.107
{\an8}I don't have
to (bleep) apologize

16:48.173 --> 16:50.642
{\an8}because I reacted like
a normal human being,

16:50.709 --> 16:52.611
{\an8}but better than a normal
human being,

16:52.678 --> 16:55.481
{\an8}'cause a normal human being
wouldn't have stopped
(bleep) hitting her.

16:55.547 --> 16:57.850
(announcer)
Actually, a normal human being

16:57.916 --> 17:00.519
probably wouldn't kick someone
in the vagina.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.655
{\an5}I guess I just wanted
to ask where your head
was at yesterday.

17:03.722 --> 17:07.792
{\an5}'Cause I'm confused
as to where all that
animosity came from.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.361
{\an5}All that, like--

17:07.859 --> 17:09.361
Okay, so I'm
not confused.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.998
{\an1}I'm very aware about
what happened yesterday.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.800
{\an1}When I come in
to just hear what

17:14.867 --> 17:17.301
{\an1}my friend's ex-boyfriend
is saying,

17:17.368 --> 17:20.973
{\an1}all I'm hearing is insults,
um, from you about me,

17:21.039 --> 17:23.040
{\an1}acting like you know me.
I think--

17:23.108 --> 17:25.577
{\an5}That all was brought up
afterwards, so that's not
what we're talking about.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.547
{\an4}And continuation of that
and that was--

17:25.644 --> 17:28.547
No, see, now you're
trying to play victim.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.449
{\an5}That's not what
we're gonna do.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.449
So I'm not a victim.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.085
{\an4}So I know you
were just drinking.
I'm not drinking.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.454
{\an6}Okay. Okay.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.454
{\an1}I'm wide awake.
I have no patience for that.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.056
{\an4}I apologized for you
insulting me, you touching me.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.056
{\an3}No.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.459
{\an5}See, that's that--
no, no.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.459
And I'm the bigger woman.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.694
{\an5}Okay. Ha, okay.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.694
{\an1}So I'm a real woman who knows
what really happened.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.163
{\an6}Okay, okay.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.163
You're out of control.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.531
{\an5}Oh, my God.
She's literally
delusional.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.765
{\an1}So stop.
Get in control.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.233
{\an5}This bitch is delusional, yo.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.233
{\an1}Okay!

17:48.300 --> 17:49.935
{\an8}Farrah does not care about
anybody in this house

17:50.002 --> 17:52.104
{\an8}except for herself and sleeping.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.439
{\an1}(Nurys)
You're so embarrassing.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.008
Sha, we don't have time
for trash like that.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.376
{\an1}(Nurys)
Bitch, you're the trash.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.711
{\an1}You kicked me in the vagina
because I was having

17:59.778 --> 18:01.079
a conversation
with someone.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.015
Like, (bleep) psychotic.

18:03.081 --> 18:06.185
Get ahold of yourself,
out-of-control groupie.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.688
{\an5}What's wrong?

18:06.251 --> 18:09.688
No, she's still lying
and is a trash can.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.290
{\an8}I know I'm a bigger person.

18:11.356 --> 18:12.424
{\an8}She's a whore.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.159
{\an8}Do I need to apologize
to someone

18:14.226 --> 18:16.395
{\an8}who put that on themselves,
who caused that for themselves,

18:16.462 --> 18:18.597
{\an8}who (bleep) deserves worse
than what she got?

18:18.664 --> 18:19.798
{\an8}No.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.637
This bitch
is delusional, yo.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.139
{\an5}It's (bleep) delusional.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.139
Trash can!

18:27.206 --> 18:29.374
{\an4}Trash?
Have you seen the way
that you carry yourself?

18:29.441 --> 18:31.176
Wow, like, what are you--
What the (bleep)?

18:31.243 --> 18:34.146
{\an1}Trash can outside
is a liar.

18:34.213 --> 18:38.484

the vagina, point blank, period.

Props to Nurys
for at least trying.

18:44.723 --> 18:47.526
You know what would solve
all these problems?
