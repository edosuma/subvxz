08:58.198 --> 09:01.268
but you're something better:
the salty old pro

09:01.301 --> 09:03.336
who's seen it all
and lived to tell about it.

09:03.369 --> 09:04.437
I do have a lot of things
to tell.

09:04.470 --> 09:06.006
So go tell them!

09:06.039 --> 09:07.674
Oh, and I guess
look for our target.

09:07.707 --> 09:09.142
Are we still doing that?

09:09.175 --> 09:11.011
[soft percussive jazz music]

09:11.044 --> 09:13.413
-Still no sign of him.
-Keep looking.

09:13.446 --> 09:14.681
He's here somewhere.

09:14.714 --> 09:16.149
-[gasps]
-Huh?

09:16.182 --> 09:18.151
Sorry, I-I have
a gasping disorder.

09:18.184 --> 09:19.619
The doctors are stumped.

09:19.652 --> 09:21.655
[gasping]

09:21.688 --> 09:23.290
[Lana]
This is unbelievable.

09:23.323 --> 09:25.759
Half our budget is just
labeled "miscellaneous."

09:25.792 --> 09:28.628
Originally we called it bribes,
but the--[laughs]

09:28.661 --> 09:31.631
...then we had to bribe the IRS
to not arrest us, so.

09:31.664 --> 09:33.733
We spend half our budget
on bribes?

09:33.766 --> 09:35.969
I mean, the blackmail
covers some of that.

09:36.002 --> 09:37.304
But Ms. Archer always said that

09:37.337 --> 09:39.573
there's no such thing
as free blackmail,

09:39.606 --> 09:42.676
which is why blackmail expenses
are labeled "et cetera."

09:42.709 --> 09:45.278
Yeah, we're not doing
any of this anymore.

09:45.311 --> 09:47.146
Well, tell that
to Mr. Persistent.

09:49.482 --> 09:52.018
Hi. I don't wanna be rude.
Maybe you were in the bathroom.

09:52.051 --> 09:53.587
But this Agency doesn't
do bribes anymore.

09:53.620 --> 09:56.356
[chuckles]
Oh, I heard. Very noble.

09:56.389 --> 09:59.226
I'm Gary.
Trust me--you want to bribe me.

09:59.259 --> 10:01.728
Actually, Gary, I don't.

10:01.761 --> 10:04.564
Because this is my Agency.
A new Agency.

10:04.597 --> 10:07.267
So take whatever deal
you had in the past,

10:07.300 --> 10:10.570
crumple it up into a tiny ball,
and shove it up or down

10:10.603 --> 10:13.106
or through any hole
of your choosing.

10:13.139 --> 10:14.508
Mm, okay then.

10:14.541 --> 10:16.142
I'll just wait
until you change your mind.

10:16.175 --> 10:17.677
Well, then prepare
to wait forever,

10:17.710 --> 10:19.379
Gary,
because nothing is gonna--

10:19.412 --> 10:20.413
-[rumbling]
-[yelps]

10:20.446 --> 10:22.148
Was that the Costa Rican
embassy?

10:22.181 --> 10:24.117
Yeah, we've been bribing
some cartel

10:24.150 --> 10:25.986
-not to blow it up.
-Why?

10:26.019 --> 10:27.320
Because if they do,

10:27.353 --> 10:29.756
it will make
the Panamanian Mafia furious.

10:29.789 --> 10:30.991
-[explosion]
-Wha--

10:31.024 --> 10:32.626
-See?
-[gunshot]

10:32.659 --> 10:35.328
-That could be a coincidence.
-[Gary chuckles] Mm-hmm, yeah.

10:35.361 --> 10:38.431
It's a real coincidence spree
out there.

10:38.464 --> 10:41.668
Wrong nose. Wrong forehead.

10:41.701 --> 10:44.337
Right nose, right forehead,
but a lady.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.206
-Señora.
-Cheers.

10:46.239 --> 10:48.475
-You're being rather attentive.
-[laughs]

10:48.508 --> 10:50.477
Only when the lady
is worth attending.

10:50.510 --> 10:53.246
And might I say,
your work is exquisite.

10:53.279 --> 10:55.582
I would love to see some
pictures of your grandchildren.

10:55.615 --> 10:58.084
Grandchildren? I'm 25!

10:58.117 --> 10:59.719
I see, señorita. [chuckles]

10:59.752 --> 11:02.189
Apologies,
but you are not my type.

11:02.222 --> 11:04.457
Ugh. I hate this place.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.560
[groaning] We have a problem.

11:06.593 --> 11:08.295
Yeah, you're interrupting me

11:08.328 --> 11:10.330
while I share
my years of wisdom

11:10.363 --> 11:12.098
with these beautiful
young ladies.

11:12.131 --> 11:13.500
-[both laugh]
-Why is that funny?

11:13.533 --> 11:16.036
You sound just like
my grandson.

11:16.069 --> 11:18.104
Grandson? I hate this place.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.673
I don't think
we're the only ones

11:19.706 --> 11:21.541
-looking for El Cambiante!
-[metallic clatter]

11:21.574 --> 11:23.310
-Ay!
-Hang on.

11:23.343 --> 11:26.112
Perfect nose, dimpled chin,
lifted buttocks.

11:26.145 --> 11:28.448
[gasps]
The waiter is El Cambiante?

11:28.481 --> 11:31.251
A disguise within a disguise?
I knew it!

11:31.284 --> 11:34.020
-After him!
-Hey! Be careful who you shove!

11:34.053 --> 11:35.589
Everyone here is older
than they look.

11:35.622 --> 11:37.257
[grunts] Ha!

11:37.290 --> 11:39.326
Oh, no, he's whimsically
getting away!

11:39.359 --> 11:41.361
And he took the only harness!

11:41.394 --> 11:43.530
[chuckles]
Oh, Zara. First zipline?

11:43.563 --> 11:46.433
[grunts] Hey!
What was wrong with your belt?

11:46.466 --> 11:48.435
[Archer] The wire is really bad
for the leather.

11:48.468 --> 11:50.103
[Zara grunts]

11:50.136 --> 11:51.404
-[Pam grunts]
-[Cyril groans]

11:51.437 --> 11:53.240
[dramatic music]

11:53.273 --> 11:54.407
-Gah-ha!
-[drink slurping]

11:54.440 --> 11:55.976
What the--you still have
your drink?

11:56.009 --> 11:57.577
I'll drop it if I have to.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.013
Good news: I saw a sloth!

12:00.046 --> 12:01.681
-Where is he?
-Probably still back that way.

12:01.714 --> 12:04.217
-You know, he's pretty slow.
-I mean El Cambiante, you knob!

12:04.250 --> 12:06.686
-Oh. [chuckles] No idea.
-[groaning]

12:06.719 --> 12:08.655
Cyril, I know this is
basically a vacation,

12:08.688 --> 12:10.190
but you still
have to wear pants.

12:10.223 --> 12:12.626
They fell off
because you took my belt.

12:12.659 --> 12:14.261
Or because your pants
were too loose.

12:14.294 --> 12:16.096
That's what the belt was for.

12:16.129 --> 12:18.165
A belt shouldn't be functional,
Cyril!

12:18.198 --> 12:19.699
-It's an accent piece!
-There he is!

12:21.034 --> 12:21.968
Split up!

12:23.636 --> 12:25.171
[Cyril yelps]

12:26.072 --> 12:28.308
-Can anyone see him?
-Need a little help, please!

12:28.341 --> 12:31.211
-[Pam] I gotcha!
-[Cyril grunts]

12:31.244 --> 12:32.646
And I've got a new friend.

12:32.679 --> 12:35.048
I shall call you Norman,
because--

12:35.081 --> 12:36.616
-[sloth snarling]
-Ow! Why are you so fast?

12:36.649 --> 12:38.385
There's a whole sin about it!

12:38.418 --> 12:40.520
[grunts, screaming]

12:42.322 --> 12:45.125
-[groans]
-Guys! He's up!

12:45.158 --> 12:46.560
I'm supposed to say that!

12:46.593 --> 12:49.029
Well, now I gotta
knock him out again.

12:49.062 --> 12:52.332
-Let's just keep him up.
-Hey, bud. Recovery mai tai?

12:52.365 --> 12:54.568
I got you this tiny fan
from the gift shop.

12:54.601 --> 12:55.735
They had flowers,
but I thought,

12:55.768 --> 12:57.637
"Everyone buys flowers,"

12:57.670 --> 13:00.340
-so... tiny fan!
-What happened?

13:00.373 --> 13:02.309
You fell 50 feet
onto jagged rocks.

13:02.342 --> 13:04.544
Also, you held
that asshole sloth

13:04.577 --> 13:06.146
to break its fall
with your body.

13:06.179 --> 13:08.114
And, uh, it bit you
when you landed.

13:08.147 --> 13:10.116
And just soaked you in piss.

13:10.149 --> 13:11.985
That's... amazing!

13:12.018 --> 13:13.186
Uh, but is it?

13:13.219 --> 13:14.988
I was worried
I was getting old.

13:15.021 --> 13:17.090
But I just survived an accident
that should have killed me.

13:17.123 --> 13:18.391
I might be invincible.

13:18.424 --> 13:20.327
-[crackling]
-[groaning]

13:20.360 --> 13:22.429
Yeah, that'd be
the 30 stitches.

13:22.462 --> 13:25.298
Or the nanobots,
if they decided to rebel.

13:25.331 --> 13:28.468
[sighs] Fine, I'm probably
not invincible.

13:28.501 --> 13:30.403
Just lucky to the point
of being immortal.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.305
So where are we on the mission?

13:32.338 --> 13:34.040
We lost El Cambiante
in the jungle,

13:34.073 --> 13:35.475
but now that we know
what he looks like,

13:35.508 --> 13:37.344
I was able to find him
in the hospital database.

13:37.377 --> 13:39.045
It looks like
he got his surgery.

13:39.078 --> 13:41.114
He's in recovery
with a new face.

13:41.147 --> 13:43.116
Yeah. His last face.

13:43.149 --> 13:45.452
Ooh, scary!

13:45.485 --> 13:47.721
[belches] I'm drunk.

13:47.754 --> 13:49.456
And I have rounds
with Dr. Spencer.

13:49.489 --> 13:52.492
We're taking plastic surgery
to new and forbidden places.

13:52.525 --> 13:54.327
Places we probably
shouldn't go.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.229
Places that, deep down,
make me wonder

13:56.262 --> 13:57.998
if I've awoken something
in this woman

13:58.031 --> 13:59.366
that should have
remained asleep.

13:59.399 --> 14:01.034
[foreboding music]

14:01.067 --> 14:02.636
Or not.

14:02.669 --> 14:05.405
Authorities are baffled
as violence consumes the city.

14:05.438 --> 14:07.674
We now go live to a fire
at the Chilean embassy--

14:07.707 --> 14:09.376
There is no way
this is because of us.

14:09.409 --> 14:11.411
This is a coincidence!

14:11.444 --> 14:14.047
Me finding a dollar on
laundry day is a coincidence.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.683
This is a city melting down
'cause we hit the brakes

14:16.716 --> 14:18.585
on a criminal money train.

14:18.618 --> 14:21.721
Ugh! I tried to tell you!

14:21.754 --> 14:23.323
I mean, not very hard, though.

14:23.356 --> 14:26.326
I guess, deep down,
I wanted the city to burn.

14:26.359 --> 14:27.594
[phone rings]

14:27.627 --> 14:29.729
The Agency. Hmm, I'll check.

14:29.762 --> 14:32.532
Do we care if the yakuza kills
the Australian ambassador?

14:32.565 --> 14:34.601
[Lana] Yes!
But we'll call him back.

14:34.634 --> 14:36.102
Start with the toes, please.

14:36.135 --> 14:37.971
-Ray, what have you got?
-[sighs]

14:38.004 --> 14:40.373
A tangled web
of criminal nonsense.

14:40.406 --> 14:42.542
We're bribing gun runners
to arm militias

14:42.575 --> 14:44.744
so they won't steal guns
from other militias

14:44.777 --> 14:47.180
who we're also bribing
to protect banks

14:47.213 --> 14:49.449
'cause the banks are full
of money from our other bribes.

14:49.482 --> 14:51.585
God, just tell me you have
a solution.

14:51.618 --> 14:52.752
I do. You're gonna hate it.

14:52.785 --> 14:55.088
[Lana] Ugh. Seriously?

14:55.121 --> 14:56.556
All roads lead to Gary.

14:56.589 --> 14:58.692
We pay him, it buys us time
on the others.

14:58.725 --> 15:00.660
God damn it, fucking Gary.

15:00.693 --> 15:03.196
Hey, I heard my name.
Did you decide to bribe me yet?

15:03.229 --> 15:05.532
No! And stop being
so cavalier about it.

15:05.565 --> 15:07.267
Copy that. I'll be out here.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.036
Also, I opened a new oat milk.
Is that cool?

15:10.069 --> 15:11.304
What's the big deal?

15:11.337 --> 15:13.974
A bribe's just a service,
like a haircut

15:14.007 --> 15:15.342
or a dog's haircut.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.510
The big deal is, I'm trying

15:16.543 --> 15:18.144
to do things aboveboard,
all right?

15:18.177 --> 15:20.180
And I'd rather die
than betray my principles.

15:20.213 --> 15:22.349
[ominous music]

15:22.382 --> 15:24.150
[Ray] I think
that just became an option.

15:27.487 --> 15:29.523
Guys, I think this is him!

15:29.556 --> 15:32.259
-Great, shoot him and let's go.
-The mission is to capture him!

15:32.292 --> 15:34.628
You can't yell at me; I just
got out of the hospital.

15:34.661 --> 15:37.230
Uh, what's this hospital's
policy on kidnapping?

15:37.263 --> 15:39.499
Because those nurses
don't look thrilled.

15:39.532 --> 15:41.501
Hey, those are the guys I saw
at the party.

15:41.534 --> 15:43.303
I think they're
after El Cambiante too.

15:43.336 --> 15:45.639
Which makes us allies, right?

15:45.672 --> 15:47.073
-[gunshot]
-[yelps]

15:47.106 --> 15:49.643
[groans] I'm not
supposed to jump yet!

15:49.676 --> 15:52.345
My calf implants are combing
into the backs of my knees!

15:52.378 --> 15:53.647
Who the hell are these guys?

15:53.680 --> 15:55.615
[Pam] And why do they get guns?

15:55.648 --> 15:57.384
Archer? What are you doing?

15:57.417 --> 15:58.718
Immortal, remember?

15:58.751 --> 16:00.620
Maybe he is.
All the bullets are missing--

16:00.653 --> 16:02.656
-Ow!
-Yeah, he's not.

16:02.689 --> 16:04.357
[gunfire]

16:04.390 --> 16:06.993
[dramatic music]

16:07.026 --> 16:09.396
Out the back! Go!

16:09.429 --> 16:10.697
Still think you're immortal?

16:10.730 --> 16:12.465
Obviously. Look!

16:12.498 --> 16:14.267
The bullet went
straight through.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.070
I'm made of non-vital organs
and luck!

16:17.103 --> 16:20.273
[groans] But I am losing
a lot of blood.

16:25.044 --> 16:26.112
[gasps]

16:26.145 --> 16:27.380
[dramatic music]

16:27.413 --> 16:28.982
-[Zara] Did we lose them?
-Lose them?

16:29.015 --> 16:30.217
It's a mid-sized hospital,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.018
not the Trastevere neighborhood
of Rome.

16:32.051 --> 16:34.688
What? It's an easy place
to lose people.

16:34.721 --> 16:36.389
Also, it seems like
we lost them.

16:36.422 --> 16:37.691
Ooh! Not these guys, though.

16:37.724 --> 16:40.093
[gunfire]

16:40.126 --> 16:43.096
Guys, the small penis hospital
is, uh, down the road.

16:43.129 --> 16:44.631
Can we not
taunt the men with guns

16:44.664 --> 16:46.266
while we're all so injured?

16:46.299 --> 16:49.135
A positive attitude is the key
to recovery, Cyril.

16:49.168 --> 16:52.506
Although I'm feeling pretty
negative about this dead end.

16:52.539 --> 16:54.374
[gunfire]

16:54.407 --> 16:56.343
[yelps]

16:56.376 --> 16:58.245
[grunts]
Do all your missions end

16:58.278 --> 17:00.013
with you cornered
and waiting to die?

17:00.046 --> 17:02.215
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a lot of 'em.
