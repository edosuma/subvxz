WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:08.927
<i>Think about Witness Protection.</i>

00:09.010 --> 00:11.596
<i>Dad, we should do this way more often.</i>

00:11.680 --> 00:14.349
<i>Wherever I go,
part of me is with you.</i>

00:14.432 --> 00:16.059
<i>I don't think I can do this.</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:20.438
<i>I have to go. It's the only
way to keep our family safe.</i>

00:26.986 --> 00:29.114
Hands up. Don't move.

00:30.907 --> 00:34.327
Oh. You scared the bejesus outta me.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.038
Oh, my God, what happened?

00:38.289 --> 00:39.541
Oh!

00:40.458 --> 00:42.252
It's Iris.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.944
Wally warned me
that something was off with Iris.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.904
And then... Sunshine attacked Frost.

01:09.988 --> 01:13.908
I noticed that she was
being weird with you.

01:13.992 --> 01:14.993
Cold, even.

01:16.453 --> 01:18.121
I just didn't say anything.

01:18.705 --> 01:21.082
- It's not your fault.
- Well, it feels like it.

01:22.834 --> 01:26.171
- Where are the other duplicates now?
- Iris' copy is gone.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.216
She... It...

01:31.050 --> 01:33.511
shattered into a million pieces
right in front of me.

01:34.471 --> 01:35.972
I know it wasn't her.

01:36.055 --> 01:39.225
But right before it happened,
she seemed so...

01:40.810 --> 01:42.145
alive.

01:43.897 --> 01:45.565
Almost like she was really back.

01:46.441 --> 01:48.419
I'm trying to have hope
that it's all gonna work out,

01:48.443 --> 01:51.696
but I can't help feeling...

01:54.324 --> 01:56.201
Joe, what if I can't save her this time?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.619
I believe that you can.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.038
But, do you?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.839
They're just gone?

02:09.923 --> 02:13.009
What does that even mean, "Mirrorverse"?
Can we even get them back?

02:13.092 --> 02:15.845
Oh, my God,
we have to warn David's husband.

02:15.929 --> 02:17.889
I've been living with
some copy of Kamilla...

02:18.640 --> 02:20.683
while the real one's trapped somewhere?

02:20.767 --> 02:22.685
Eva said they're safe for now.

02:22.769 --> 02:24.479
And you're taking her word for it?

02:25.855 --> 02:28.650
- For all we know, they're dead already...
- They're not.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.294
So just...
You don't even think about that.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.403
We have to think about that.

02:33.363 --> 02:37.367
What if creating Kamilla's duplicate
actually killed the real Kamilla?

02:37.450 --> 02:39.869
Same thing with Singh,
same thing with Iris.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.206
- Hello?
- What do you want me to say?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.542
Anything! That we have a plan,
that we'll get them back.

02:45.625 --> 02:48.086
I don't have a plan, Cisco!

02:48.169 --> 02:49.688
Eva can move anywhere, through any
mirror in the universe

02:49.712 --> 02:51.005
in the blink of an eye.

02:51.089 --> 02:54.342
She's faster than I am,
and somehow I'm supposed to stop her?

02:54.425 --> 02:57.679
And still hope to God that Iris and
everybody else is still alive in a world

02:57.762 --> 02:59.073
that we don't even understand!

02:59.097 --> 03:00.765
Hey! Hey.

03:00.849 --> 03:03.393
You're both right, okay?
You're both right.

03:03.977 --> 03:05.937
But we cannot fall apart.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.523
We need to work the problem,
not tear each other down.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.025
So here's what I'm gonna do.
I am gonna call David's husband,

03:11.109 --> 03:13.361
and I'm gonna see
if he has seen Singh's duplicate.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.405
I'll check the Bentley Building.

03:15.488 --> 03:17.866
Mirror-Iris and Kamilla
were alone there a lot.

03:17.949 --> 03:19.260
Maybe they left something behind.

03:19.284 --> 03:20.451
You want company?

03:20.535 --> 03:22.215
Maybe you should find
something else to do.

03:23.079 --> 03:24.181
Look, you can come with me.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.125
I'm gonna see if I can dig up any
details on this Eva McCulloch.

03:32.839 --> 03:35.049
If the Mirrorverse
is just another dimension,

03:35.133 --> 03:37.218
there might be a way
to enter vibrationally.

03:37.802 --> 03:40.430
Caitlin's still on the mend,
so I can't ask her for help.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.392
I guess that means
I'm doing this one on my own.

03:47.645 --> 03:50.273
Barry, look,
I understand how you're feeling.

03:50.356 --> 03:52.567
Cecile, I know you're trying to help me.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.445
I appreciate it, but...

03:56.112 --> 03:58.823
right now, I'm gonna work
on the Artificial Speed Force, I just...

03:58.907 --> 04:01.284
There's no point in finding Eva
if I'm useless against her.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.958
I read Eva's secret files,

04:09.042 --> 04:13.046
and now I know that
there's a mirror version of Kamilla,

04:13.129 --> 04:16.341
which means that the real Kamilla
must be in here somewhere.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.510
I have to find her.

04:22.347 --> 04:23.681
I can't think straight.

04:25.058 --> 04:27.310
Eva calls it "neural dissonance,"

04:27.977 --> 04:31.814
the way that your mind changes here.

04:31.898 --> 04:35.360
I'm leaving this here
for you in case you find it.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.028
But don't find me.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.491
Barry...

04:44.285 --> 04:46.788
no matter what worlds
try to keep us apart...

04:48.498 --> 04:50.375
I will always be with you.

05:06.516 --> 05:07.934
How dumb am I, huh?

05:09.477 --> 05:11.479
Yeah, that feeling's going around.

05:11.562 --> 05:15.274
I've been working side-by-side
with duplicates this whole time.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.318
Some budding reporter I am.

05:17.944 --> 05:20.697
Wait, does that mean
I'm in charge of <i>The Citizen?</i>

05:20.780 --> 05:22.198
How the hell am I supposed to...

05:37.922 --> 05:38.840
Godspeed.

05:38.841 --> 05:40.883
You're the one
who stopped the others.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.427
I'm not impressed.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.430
What do you want?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.477
Thank you.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.648
I was looking for a reason
to test out this Pulse Cannon.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.437
This isn't over.

06:15.877 --> 06:18.755
Didn't you say all four Godspeeds
were locked up at Iron Heights?

06:18.838 --> 06:21.299
Those are just cybernetic drones
with modem-speak.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.176
This one was talking. And, by the way,

06:23.259 --> 06:25.928
do you not happen to have
protective protocols for this place?

06:26.012 --> 06:27.180
Do not put this on me.

06:27.263 --> 06:30.641
I'm trying to figure out a way into the
Mirrorverse. What were you doing?

06:30.725 --> 06:32.268
I was saving our speedster.

06:32.351 --> 06:33.662
Oh, good for you. You did something.

06:33.686 --> 06:34.913
Thank you. Could I have a parade?

06:34.937 --> 06:36.415
You don't seem to be doing
anything else.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.959
- What? What?
- Stop. Just give it a...

06:40.359 --> 06:41.569
What are you thinking?

06:42.028 --> 06:43.196
Uh...

06:47.158 --> 06:49.243
Cisco, you're the schmiencey guy.

06:49.327 --> 06:51.037
Must have some kind of a plan, right?

06:53.706 --> 06:55.625
Cisco, you still...
You still with us, bud?

06:55.708 --> 06:58.294
Ralph, please, I'm trying to
get our friends back right now.

07:02.048 --> 07:03.883
Okay. Okay.

07:05.384 --> 07:06.385
Allegra, you said...

07:06.594 --> 07:10.098
Godspeed's lightning
caused some sort of blast.

07:10.181 --> 07:13.684
Yeah, he was like a friggin'
lightning storm in the room.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.978
But it was his thunder
that did the damage.

07:16.646 --> 07:17.939
Not thunder.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.524
Vibrations.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.442
Makes sense.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.736
You go fast enough,
you create a sonic boom,

07:24.362 --> 07:27.698
velocity transmutes
into vibrations in the air.

07:27.782 --> 07:30.576
Only this Godspeed figured out a way...

07:32.161 --> 07:34.580
to reverse those vibrations,

07:34.664 --> 07:37.708
and use them to
extract speed from a speedster.

07:37.792 --> 07:41.003
Okay, so he's power hungry.
How do we stop him?

07:41.087 --> 07:45.299
Well, we'd need a really, really deep
understanding of vibrational sonics.

07:45.383 --> 07:46.759
Great. Do we have that?

07:47.343 --> 07:48.344
Not really. No.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.887
I know who could help us.

07:50.805 --> 07:52.849
Hartley.

07:52.932 --> 07:54.392
Hartley Rathaway.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.145
Who's Hartley Rathaway?

07:57.228 --> 08:00.857
He is an expert in psychoacoustics
and sonic vibrations.

08:00.940 --> 08:04.735
He used to work for S.T.A.R. Labs.
Also, a jerk who hates us so much

08:04.819 --> 08:07.155
he tried to julienne your insides.

08:07.238 --> 08:09.740
It turns out that he hates the Flash
even more post-Crisis,

08:09.824 --> 08:11.742
only we don't really know why.

08:11.826 --> 08:13.494
Correction. I know why.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.830
My Crisis research
dug up the answer to that.

08:27.258 --> 08:29.177
Henchmen?
No, it was only me and Hartley.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.803
Not in this timeline.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.640
<i>The Pied Piper's Band of Merry Men</i>

08:35.725 --> 08:39.645
<i>tried to flank you while you were
distracted playing Musical Cars.</i>

08:39.729 --> 08:42.940
<i>Yeah, you clocked them, but when
one of them tried to shoot at you,</i>

08:43.024 --> 08:44.483
<i>you countered with a lightning bolt.</i>

08:44.567 --> 08:48.738
<i>That lightning collided
with the weapon's blast, and...</i>

08:51.949 --> 08:54.118
Turns out, that was
Hartley's right-hand man,

08:54.911 --> 08:56.204
Roderick Smith.

08:58.456 --> 09:01.125
It's Frost. Sorry, guys, I gotta...

09:01.209 --> 09:02.460
I gotta check on this.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.045
Roderick Smith is being held

09:04.128 --> 09:06.214
in an energy-containment unit
in Mercury Labs.

09:06.297 --> 09:07.673
Apparently, it's the only thing

09:07.757 --> 09:10.218
that's keeping him
from completely disintegrating.

09:10.301 --> 09:12.386
I guess that's a no
to Pied Piper's help.

09:12.470 --> 09:13.971
Well, he did almost kill us, so...

09:14.055 --> 09:17.350
Let's not bicker over who killed who.
We can fix this.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.186
Just make his right-hand man
right again,

09:20.269 --> 09:21.538
this Roderick fellow, and then maybe

09:21.562 --> 09:23.282
Hartley will agree
to a little quid pro quo.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.317
I have a theory.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.116
I got your text. Are you okay?
Is the wound getting worse?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.910
Ralph, I'm fine.

09:36.035 --> 09:38.913
As fine as anyone with
a chronic light bullet avulsion

09:38.996 --> 09:40.414
can be in their chest.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.293
This patch is keeping me stable for now.

09:44.377 --> 09:45.711
Then, what's the emergency?

09:45.795 --> 09:46.795
Payback.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.258
I just wanted to say thank you...

09:50.758 --> 09:53.177
for everything you've done
for me this year. For...

09:54.095 --> 09:56.264
taking me to an art show, and...

09:56.347 --> 09:59.433
teaching me to how to get in touch
with emotions I didn't even know I had.

09:59.517 --> 10:01.686
Hey. That's what life coaches are for.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.896
Well, I know
I've still got a long way to go,

10:03.980 --> 10:07.817
but I'm leaving soon,
so we might not be able to finish this.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.528
You getting better
is our number-one priority.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.322
And your mom is
the expert on all things ice,

10:13.406 --> 10:15.449
so she'll patch up that wound
of yours, and then...

10:15.533 --> 10:17.034
we can pick up where we left off.

10:17.118 --> 10:20.121
- I could be gone for a long time.
- Okay.

10:22.832 --> 10:24.959
But you are coming back, right?

10:25.042 --> 10:27.044
Look, Ralph, forget it. I just...

10:27.670 --> 10:29.463
I wanted to say goodbye
to an old friend.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.551
Look...

10:33.634 --> 10:36.137
friends say, "So long," or,

10:36.220 --> 10:39.265
"Until we meet again." They...
They don't really say goodbye.

10:40.516 --> 10:43.436
So, why don't you just tell me
what's really bothering you?

10:43.519 --> 10:46.605
I'm fine. Just stop trying to
smell a mystery or whatever.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.358
Too late. The Tannhauser tech...

10:51.068 --> 10:52.945
it's the only stuff
that can fix you, but...

10:53.946 --> 10:55.257
you don't really wanna go, do you?

10:55.281 --> 10:56.824
Just drop it.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.744
It's not the tech, is it?

11:00.619 --> 11:01.662
It's the person behind it.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.750
Frost, why don't you wanna see Carla?

11:05.833 --> 11:09.337
Because she's not my mom, okay?
She's Caity's.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.963
- You don't really mean that.
- Yeah.

11:11.047 --> 11:12.047
I do.

11:12.882 --> 11:14.258
Carla doesn't know me.

11:14.342 --> 11:17.261
After all these years,
it's just been her and Caity.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.013
Hey...

11:19.096 --> 11:20.264
you're her daughter, too.

11:20.348 --> 11:23.809
I'm the cold, dark part of
her daughter that she tolerates.

11:23.893 --> 11:25.227
If that were even true...

11:26.270 --> 11:29.190
why would I be sitting here,
worried about you?

11:29.273 --> 11:30.691
'Cause you're a good guy, Ralph.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.956
And you're an equal member
of Team Flash...

11:34.945 --> 11:36.364
just like Caitlin.

11:37.365 --> 11:39.575
And you are just as important.

11:41.369 --> 11:44.163
And if you can't see that
for yourself...

11:48.918 --> 11:50.044
then maybe you're right.

11:51.796 --> 11:53.589
Maybe you do have a long way to go.

12:11.107 --> 12:12.108
Hello, Flash.

12:17.530 --> 12:19.490
I heard you coming from a mile away.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.075
Hartley...

12:21.158 --> 12:23.202
I know what happened now,

12:23.285 --> 12:24.495
and I'm sorry.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.249
Something wrong with your speed?

12:28.332 --> 12:29.332
Look...

12:30.084 --> 12:32.086
I'm trying to make things
right with you.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.169
Now you're sorry?

12:33.212 --> 12:35.381
I think I can help Roderick.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.600
What do you know about Roderick?

12:46.684 --> 12:48.352
I know his condition's my fault.

12:48.436 --> 12:51.480
But I think I can fix it,
if you'll give me the chance.

12:51.564 --> 12:52.606
And?

12:52.690 --> 12:55.109
And, if you're willing,
I could use your help.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.528
- There's a new speedster...
- Hmm. Here we go.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.405
He's a threat
to the whole city, Hartley.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.948
He's using sound waves.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.868
You're the only person
we know that can stop him.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.119
- Lives...
- I don't care.

13:05.953 --> 13:06.996
I swear,

13:07.121 --> 13:09.206
- I wanna help Roderick.
- Well, you can't.

13:09.290 --> 13:12.418
- Let me try.
- I said you can't help him.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.627
Don't you get it?

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
No one can.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.551
<i>I thought I could stabilize
his molecules with my sonics, but...</i>

13:30.311 --> 13:31.770
I wasn't strong enough.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.230
So you sent him to Mercury Labs.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.066
We think we can help him.

13:37.526 --> 13:38.569
Let us show you.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.863
Who is this "we," and "us"?

13:44.909 --> 13:46.243
Harrison Wells?

13:47.411 --> 13:49.955
Nash Wells, actually.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.457
Harrison Wells was my doppelganger.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.792
Your doppelganger?

13:53.876 --> 13:55.127
How to explain... Okay,

13:55.211 --> 13:57.838
so there was this big event.
We called it Crisis...

13:57.963 --> 13:59.882
- He's his twin.
- He's my twin.

14:00.716 --> 14:02.426
Huh. Twice blessed.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.931
We think that there may actually
be a way to help Roderick.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.308
I've seen this kind of
molecular disembodiment before.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.391
All right, bear with me.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.479
I think if we combine
concentrated light energy

14:13.562 --> 14:16.857
with an inert gas
with a high thermal conductivity,

14:16.941 --> 14:19.151
it may actually slow down...

14:20.110 --> 14:22.404
Roderick's molecules,
and give him his body back.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.740
So basically combine light with helium.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.244
I'm the smartest guy
in the room, I get it.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.829
Fine.

14:31.622 --> 14:32.706
You fix Roderick...

14:34.041 --> 14:35.376
then maybe I'll help you.

14:49.890 --> 14:50.975
Kamilla?

14:52.977 --> 14:53.977
Wait, what are you doing?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.520
- It's me, Iris.
- You're the one who sent me here.

14:56.564 --> 14:58.857
No! Whoever she was,
that was not me, I swear.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.647
Then tell me something
only the real Iris would know.

15:03.362 --> 15:06.198
Cisco is the love of your life.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.616
Uh...

15:08.284 --> 15:10.744
And you knew it
from the moment you met him,

15:12.621 --> 15:14.832
when you were bartending
at the Liquid Kitty.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.461
He is the most brilliant man
that you know,

15:19.545 --> 15:22.756
and he always makes you laugh.

15:27.094 --> 15:30.889
You are the only person allowed to wear
his Chewbacca t-shirt.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.726
The one that his parents gave him
when he was 14 years old.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.437
It's you.

15:38.439 --> 15:41.191
Thank God. After you or...

15:41.275 --> 15:43.253
whoever looked like you
shot me with that Mirror Gun,

15:43.277 --> 15:44.903
I just woke up here totally alone.

15:45.571 --> 15:46.614
You never saw Eva?

15:47.448 --> 15:49.617
Eva McCulloch, Carver's wife.

15:49.700 --> 15:50.993
She's alive?

15:51.785 --> 15:52.828
She's here?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.413
She's the meta behind all of this,

15:54.496 --> 15:56.624
and now she's escaped into our world.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.626
Then we have to get back.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.296
I gathered all the items
that the Mirror Gun sent here.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.732
I've been analyzing them for clues,

16:03.756 --> 16:06.967
but the data keeps getting all wonky
when I try to see the screen.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.889
Hey, you okay?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.933
No. No, I'm not.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.687
But you are.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.816
The neural dissonance
hasn't affected you yet.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.111
It's this condition that affects
our minds in this Mirrorverse.

16:26.195 --> 16:28.113
That explains the screens.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.008
When I look at them too long,
I get a headache.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.492
Yeah, that's how it started for me.

16:31.575 --> 16:35.412
With Eva's computers,
everything was broken and fractured,

16:35.496 --> 16:37.623
but now I can read them.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.666
You can help us
get out of here.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.919
Uh, you know, I can't.

16:42.628 --> 16:45.214
Shh. It hurts. The truth hurts.

16:45.339 --> 16:47.883
We shouldn't be here.
We should not be here.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.426
I should not be here.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.101
Not much has changed.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.229
Ugh. S.T.A.R. Labs,

17:00.312 --> 17:03.315
still keeping mediocre engineers
around, I see.

17:03.399 --> 17:04.751
Do we have to work with this douchebag?

17:04.775 --> 17:08.112
Look, I've heard that you two
hate each other, but let's just focus.

17:10.155 --> 17:14.576
A few months ago, I theorized
there might be a mechanical way

17:14.660 --> 17:16.704
to open a breach
to an alternate dimension.

17:16.787 --> 17:19.915
Looks like an engine for
focusing subatomic vibrations,

17:19.998 --> 17:21.583
or, as you would say, "vibes."

17:22.751 --> 17:24.837
Oh, please, I figured that out ages ago.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.631
The hair? Dead giveaway, Ramon.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.883
You too, Flash.

17:30.884 --> 17:32.636
It was only three facilities
in the state

17:32.720 --> 17:35.013
that could build a suit
with that much bleeding-edge tech.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.517
But only one of them had
someone brilliant enough to build it.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.269
- Thanks.
- Harrison Wells.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.032
- There it is.
- What I don't get

17:42.104 --> 17:44.982
is why you need a machine,
when you could just use your damn vibes.

17:45.607 --> 17:48.402
Unless... you can't vibe anymore.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.113
Ooh, ouch.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.031
You lost your meta mojo.

17:53.574 --> 17:56.410
Well, you could try
being a barista, maybe.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.370
I gave up my powers by choice.

18:00.122 --> 18:03.417
You know, I'm making this so that
I can save the person I love the most.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.588
But I wouldn't expect you
to understand that, Hartley.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.216
The person you love the most
is yourself.

18:13.302 --> 18:15.702
Come find me when you're ready to work.

18:16.597 --> 18:19.767
Cecile just got Roderick back
from Mercury Labs. He's here.

18:28.609 --> 18:29.961
Here's what I need from you.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.447
I need you to direct a concentrated
UV blast into the reception conduit.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.824
Now, this containment unit,
I am going to release

18:35.908 --> 18:38.243
helium into it,
and when those two things collide,

18:38.327 --> 18:41.830
pop, it should lock Roderick's molecules
back into human form.

18:41.914 --> 18:44.333
You ready? We'll go on three.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.629
One, two...

18:50.172 --> 18:51.298
three.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.517
It's working.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.902
No, no, wait. Stop.

19:13.362 --> 19:14.363
Wells, enough.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.242
- Stop! You're hurting him!
- Nash.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.129
Hartley, I'm sorry. But we can try...

19:31.213 --> 19:32.965
I was stupid for trusting you.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.926
Don't ask me for anything, ever.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.180
My world is over. I hope yours burns.

19:46.979 --> 19:49.648
Give me your velocity,
or your city pays.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.816
You have one hour.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.736
You're not fast enough to stop me.
None of you are.

19:54.820 --> 19:59.741
Death will rain down on your city,
Flash, unless you give me what I want.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.827
Choose wisely.

20:19.761 --> 20:23.432
I don't think these equations
are gonna help fix Roderick that much,

20:23.515 --> 20:25.976
plus, we simply need
a better bonding agent.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.479
You do that. I'm working
on the artificial Speed Force right now.

20:33.734 --> 20:35.986
Nash! Hey, Nash, what the hell?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.905
I've been working on these all day.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.823
You're wasting time, why?

20:42.910 --> 20:45.120
You don't have to tell me,
we don't know each other.

20:46.413 --> 20:50.792
You'd talk to Joe and Iris...
but they're not here.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.669
Whose fault is that?

20:52.753 --> 20:55.172
- Whose fault is that?
- Mine! All right?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.841
Is that what you want me to say?

21:03.889 --> 21:05.307
I'm supposed to lead this team.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.269
Now, I don't even know
what to tell them.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.563
When I lost Maya...

21:13.273 --> 21:14.709
Every day since then, I wanted to say,

21:14.733 --> 21:16.485
"Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
It was my fault."

21:17.694 --> 21:18.694
But she's gone.

21:18.946 --> 21:23.784
When I was Pariah, and I watched
my mistake burn down the multi-verse,

21:23.867 --> 21:27.329
I wanted to tell those people I'm sorry,
but they were gone, and it was over.

21:27.412 --> 21:33.043
And this is not over for you!
You can find your way out of this.

21:35.087 --> 21:38.090
All you have to do is trust yourself.

21:38.173 --> 21:41.343
How am I supposed to do that? I just
lived with an impostor for five weeks.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.638
Forgive yourself.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.431
You showed me that.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.186
Now it's time for you to do it for you.

21:52.562 --> 21:57.359
And you know what, if you can't,
do it for Iris.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.195
I just miss her so much.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.115
Without her here, it feels like...

22:13.333 --> 22:15.210
I know why Hartley's world is over.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.632
Thank you, Nash.

22:34.813 --> 22:36.273
Whoa. Whoa, hey.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.153
Look, I know you're hurting. I do.

22:42.362 --> 22:46.491
But... I was with Kamilla
when Bloodwork's monsters attacked.

22:46.575 --> 22:50.454
And you gotta trust me
that no matter where she is,

22:50.537 --> 22:52.581
your girl knows
how to take care of herself.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.667
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.

22:56.835 --> 22:57.835
It's just...

23:00.630 --> 23:04.176
When Kamilla's around,
I want to show her I'm strong.

23:05.343 --> 23:08.180
I want to believe
I'm making the right decisions.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.308
She gives me the confidence I need,
but she's...

23:16.146 --> 23:17.606
She's not here.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.903
And all I can think about
is the hero I used to be.

23:24.404 --> 23:30.869
He was just full of life, and he wasn't
afraid to do the impossible. He was...

23:34.414 --> 23:37.751
He was Vibe, you know?

23:38.585 --> 23:40.003
He had all the answers.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.464
Sometimes, he was the answer.

23:46.093 --> 23:48.970
If Kamilla is not here,
and Vibe is gone...

23:51.306 --> 23:52.641
What if...

23:52.724 --> 23:54.768
What if you don't have all the answers,

23:55.268 --> 23:58.313
and you're making the wrong decisions?

23:59.940 --> 24:01.191
Cisco,

24:01.274 --> 24:03.944
Kamilla did not fall in love
with your powers.

24:06.113 --> 24:07.572
She fell in love with you.

24:08.365 --> 24:13.453
You and that big,
beautiful brain of yours.

24:13.787 --> 24:16.790
Boo-hoo, Cisco Ramon isn't Vibe anymore.

24:17.791 --> 24:18.917
You know what he is?

24:19.376 --> 24:22.003
He is a damn brilliant engineer

24:22.087 --> 24:25.340
who has never backed down
from doing the impossible before.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.264
You gonna start now?

24:34.891 --> 24:36.143
No, ma'am.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.867
You okay?

24:58.248 --> 25:00.500
I let Eva
manipulate me all this time...

25:00.959 --> 25:02.961
and now the neural dissonance
is getting worse.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.214
How did I let that happen?

25:06.923 --> 25:09.885
My skill as a reporter is
being able to see the truth,

25:09.968 --> 25:13.680
but Eva proved to me
that I can't trust my instincts...

25:15.056 --> 25:16.141
or myself.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.977
You weren't the only one she tricked.

25:19.060 --> 25:22.439
Your duplicate tricked me,
everyone, even Barry.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.358
Don't beat yourself up
for not being perfect.

25:26.109 --> 25:29.237
Of course, Eva would want you
to see your strength as a weakness.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.323
That's how she's kept you trapped.

25:32.157 --> 25:35.702
But if you want to escape,
you have to trust yourself again.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.080
I do.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.337
So, where do we start?

25:46.755 --> 25:50.133
There is one other duplicate
that Eva created, Chief Singh.

25:51.468 --> 25:52.468
We should find him.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.723
If we're gonna go home,
we're all going home, together.

26:04.397 --> 26:05.398
Get out!

26:06.107 --> 26:08.735
- I know why you're so upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

26:11.905 --> 26:15.158
I know what it's like to be responsible
for losing the person I love.

26:17.494 --> 26:21.289
Roderick, he's not just another
hired gun, is he?

26:22.832 --> 26:24.459
He's my boyfriend.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.879
The love of my life.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.592
I put him in the line of fire
when I fought you,

26:32.759 --> 26:35.303
meaning that what happened to him
is my fault.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.832
You're not the only one to blame.

26:37.681 --> 26:38.741
I threw the lightning, remember?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.976
I gave him the weapon
that made you defend yourself.

26:43.311 --> 26:45.063
And then, when I couldn't help him...

26:45.647 --> 26:47.732
You got him the help he needed.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.735
He was better off at Mercury Labs
than with me.

26:52.737 --> 26:54.614
I was useless.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.122
Someone just reminded me that...

27:03.206 --> 27:06.459
we're no good
to the people that we love if...

27:06.543 --> 27:09.045
we can't find the strength
to move forward,

27:09.129 --> 27:10.797
and forgive ourselves.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.010
Thanks, Oprah.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.710
<i>Hey, we got
a big problem at Iron Heights.</i>

27:20.473 --> 27:21.891
You can stay here,

27:23.310 --> 27:25.550
or you can be the person
that Roderick fell in love with.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.316
It's your call.

27:39.659 --> 27:40.659
Hey.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.330
Satellites just picked up
a massive energy surge in the Meta-Wing.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.337
It's gone.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.297
Get a video feed.
What happened in there?

27:52.422 --> 27:53.715
I'm trying.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.843
Oh, crap.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.472
Every Godspeed we caught till now,
he took all their speed.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.196
Record this. You have one minute, Flash.

28:16.738 --> 28:20.617
<i>After that, someone dies every 60
seconds until you surrender what's mine.</i>

28:22.869 --> 28:23.787
I have to stop him.

28:23.788 --> 28:25.164
- Wait, wait. Barry.
- What?

28:25.246 --> 28:29.501
Look, I know you want to do this,
but you don't have a lot of speed, okay?

28:29.584 --> 28:32.337
We need to call C.C.P.D.
or A.R.G.U.S., anyone who...

28:32.420 --> 28:35.256
Godspeed is my responsibility.
I have to face him.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.759
- Barry...
- I have enough speed left to do this.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.344
Even if I don't, I have to try.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.306
<i>I have to try.</i>

28:43.390 --> 28:46.101
<i>Someone dies every 60 seconds</i>

28:46.184 --> 28:48.728
<i>- until you surrender what's mine.</i>
- ...<i>a lot of speed.</i>

28:48.812 --> 28:51.052
...<i>speed is my responsibility.
I have to face him.</i>

28:51.106 --> 28:54.025
<i>I have to try.
I have enough speed left to do this.</i>

28:54.109 --> 28:55.294
<i>- Someone dies...
- I have to try.</i>

28:55.318 --> 28:58.321
<i>- Someone dies...
- Even if I don't, I have to try.</i>

28:58.405 --> 29:01.157
<i>I have to try. I have to try.</i>

29:03.368 --> 29:04.786
Time's up, Flash.

29:08.331 --> 29:10.083
Have you come to give me what's mine?

29:10.166 --> 29:11.246
You have to catch me first.

29:18.049 --> 29:20.718
He's running at Mach Five.
He's moving faster than you.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.387
But I know this city better than him.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.498
Barry!

29:56.171 --> 29:57.129
You're pathetic.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.966
You don't deserve the speed
you were given. We do.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.186
I didn't think you were coming.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.836
I didn't save you so we could chat.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.547
That's your backup?
It won't help.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.966
Hartley, I can't stop Godspeed,
he's too powerful.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.093
God, how thick are you?

30:44.177 --> 30:46.030
Roderick got hurt
when the lightning you threw collided

30:46.054 --> 30:48.014
with the vibrational force
of his weapon.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.016
The result was a thermogenic blast

30:50.099 --> 30:52.519
capable of rendering him unstable
at a molecular level.

30:52.977 --> 30:55.939
- Just duplicate that force...
- And Godspeed's toast.

30:56.022 --> 30:56.940
Bingo-bango.

30:56.942 --> 30:57.942
Flash!

30:58.775 --> 31:02.612
Now you'll feel
the real power of speed.

31:09.661 --> 31:10.661
You ready?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.121
Let's do it.

31:14.624 --> 31:16.834
Where is he going?
Barry, you're going the wrong way.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.044
Wait for it.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.304
Now, Flash!

31:41.484 --> 31:43.528
- They crossed streams!
- They crossed streams!

31:56.791 --> 32:00.211
- Hartley, thanks for coming after me.
- Yeah, don't mention it.

32:00.295 --> 32:02.255
You won another battle
against some speed-freak,

32:02.338 --> 32:03.840
and I lost everything.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.259
I promise we'll figure something out.

32:08.261 --> 32:11.389
Okay,
haven't seen that one before.

32:12.265 --> 32:14.017
Is that Godspeed's blood?

32:17.729 --> 32:19.897
Satellite readings
indicate it could be

32:19.981 --> 32:23.484
some kind of biogenic
electrolyte secretion.

32:24.861 --> 32:27.071
- It's charged sound.
- It's charged sound.

32:28.114 --> 32:30.074
<i>Oh, boys...</i>

32:30.241 --> 32:32.910
I do believe
we found the solution we're looking for.

32:45.757 --> 32:46.757
How does it work?

32:47.634 --> 32:51.137
Normal sound waves need to have
a transmission medium to move through,

32:51.220 --> 32:52.847
but charged sound builds its own.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.392
Normal sound can temporarily
reattach molecular bonds.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.269
A charged sound can
permanently attach them.

32:59.395 --> 33:01.648
It's like a permanent bonding agent.

33:03.232 --> 33:06.486
Hartley, this will stabilize Roderick.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.031
If you hurt him, I'll hurt you.

33:12.742 --> 33:14.160
- Ready?
- Ready.

33:26.756 --> 33:29.592
- Hartley. Hartley.
- I'm here.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.888
I thought I'd lost you.

33:34.555 --> 33:36.950
Come on. You know I'm a little harder
to get rid of than that.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.897
So... what happened?

33:44.273 --> 33:48.569
Last thing I remember,
we were at the dam, and the Flash, he...

33:49.696 --> 33:51.239
He helped bring you back.

33:53.908 --> 33:55.201
We'll give you guys some space.

34:03.543 --> 34:07.797
I'm glad we reunited the happy couple,
but I have to say, I am super relieved

34:07.880 --> 34:09.632
to finally get rid of Godspeed.

34:09.716 --> 34:11.342
And this one talks, so now we know

34:11.426 --> 34:13.025
we got the real
August Heart behind bars.

34:13.511 --> 34:15.054
That's not the real Godspeed.

34:16.013 --> 34:18.474
Once he was placed
in a meta-dampening cell,

34:18.558 --> 34:20.685
I questioned him as the Flash, and...

34:21.351 --> 34:23.146
all he could say was,

34:23.228 --> 34:26.023
"The one who sent me
wants infinite velocity."

34:27.567 --> 34:31.487
When you were fighting Godspeed,
he said, "We deserve your speed."

34:31.571 --> 34:35.199
- Who's "we"?
- Does "we" include the one who sent him?

34:35.366 --> 34:37.784
- He couldn't tell me.
- Because he stopped talking.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.330
And started chirping
like a broken modem...

34:43.416 --> 34:44.876
just like the rest of them.

34:49.839 --> 34:53.760
So, I came to apologize.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.139
So you broke in?
My front door is locked.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.933
I may have slipped under the doorframe.

35:01.017 --> 35:05.646
Literally. So I guess I actually have
two things to apologize for.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.272
Um...

35:07.273 --> 35:10.359
Listen, I shouldn't have been so harsh.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.155
It's okay. You were right.
I have a long way to go.

35:14.489 --> 35:15.740
No, you don't.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.119
A "dib-ploma"?

35:20.203 --> 35:22.413
Congratulations on graduating
Life Coach school.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.778
- Ralph, this is ridiculous.
- You know what's ridiculous?

35:25.208 --> 35:27.335
You thinking that
you're not as important as Caitlin.

35:27.835 --> 35:31.798
And being intimidated by a parent?
That's normal.

35:37.136 --> 35:41.474
Frost, I was ten when my dad walked out
on Mom and me.

35:42.809 --> 35:44.852
You don't think a day goes by
where I'm not...

35:45.394 --> 35:48.689
absolutely terrified that he's going to
show up at my front door?

35:49.232 --> 35:51.984
- He walked out on you guys. He's a jerk.
- Yeah...

35:53.027 --> 35:55.571
and a part of me still wants to see him.

35:57.573 --> 36:01.744
I guess I'm afraid Carla might actually
want to get to know me, and then...

36:02.954 --> 36:06.874
- she'll see me for who I really am.
- And that is the ironic part to me.

36:07.834 --> 36:11.379
'Cause, Frosty,
you are one awesome human being.

36:12.213 --> 36:16.092
You were just afraid that Carla
was gonna reject you,

36:16.175 --> 36:18.052
so you rejected her first.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.182
Not anymore.

36:26.936 --> 36:29.146
And that is why
you're ready to graduate.

36:30.898 --> 36:33.484
Damn, I really am
one hell of a life coach.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.611
Yeah, you are.

36:43.703 --> 36:46.080
I don't know how to thank you. I...

36:47.039 --> 36:50.459
We lost everything
when we lost each other.

36:51.961 --> 36:55.965
Even hope. Thank you for not giving up.

36:56.966 --> 36:58.509
You gave us back us.

37:00.845 --> 37:03.556
I owe you. We both do.

37:05.391 --> 37:09.979
Good luck. Just, maybe stay out of
diamond stores for a while?

37:10.062 --> 37:11.647
No promises.

37:12.773 --> 37:15.109
- Will you give us a sec?
- Yeah.

37:17.862 --> 37:21.824
Okay, look, you know I'm not exactly
the "let's hug it out" type,

37:21.908 --> 37:23.910
so I'll just say this.

37:23.993 --> 37:28.789
You gave me my world back.
You'll get your world back, too.

37:28.873 --> 37:31.792
But you have to do more than
just forgive yourself.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.716
You have to believe
that your world can change.

37:35.087 --> 37:36.367
That's the part I had forgotten.

37:38.132 --> 37:40.301
Thanks for reminding me.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.415
We've all lost so much this year.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.209
Our power.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.544
Our love.

38:16.921 --> 38:18.422
Our family.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.759
At times, it's even felt
like there's nothing left to lose.

38:22.510 --> 38:26.514
Like everything that matters
has already been taken...

38:26.597 --> 38:31.644
and our lives are empty, hollow inside.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.733
Some things can't be taken.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.569
Look around this room.

38:42.697 --> 38:45.449
We still have our faith in each other,

38:45.533 --> 38:48.744
and our will to fight for those we love.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.163
This is what we'll never lose.

38:55.042 --> 38:58.254
Eva McCulloch has never faced us
head-on.

38:59.630 --> 39:02.008
That's about to change.

39:03.884 --> 39:07.596
We're gonna find her. Beat her...

39:10.224 --> 39:11.684
and get back everyone.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.185
Amen to that.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.146
You just tell me where to stretch.

39:15.229 --> 39:16.313
And blast.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.357
Sounds violent. I'm in.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.120
I have an idea.

39:31.787 --> 39:34.623
A way to get our people
out of the Mirrorverse.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.712
We need a lossless, self-sustaining
source of perpetual energy.

39:40.921 --> 39:43.966
Sounds like you're talking
about the holy grail of science.

39:44.050 --> 39:47.053
- A perpetual motion machine.
- That's right.

39:47.136 --> 39:48.554
Hartley had some ideas.

39:49.513 --> 39:52.183
I actually think we can build one.

39:52.266 --> 39:53.768
We're just missing one component,

39:53.851 --> 39:56.812
and thanks to my travels,
I know exactly where to find it.

39:58.147 --> 40:00.107
Atlantis.

40:00.191 --> 40:02.777
Finally, Crisis pays off
in a good way for once.

40:03.277 --> 40:07.531
I know time is crucial, but don't worry.
I'll hurry back.

40:07.656 --> 40:08.741
Can I come?

40:08.824 --> 40:11.264
Actually, if you don't mind,
I'd like for you to stay.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.704
Team Flash needs as many hands on deck
as possible.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.378
Now let's get to work.

40:55.329 --> 40:57.665
I'm coming for you, Joseph.
