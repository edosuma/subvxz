Who are you?

00:02.851 --> 00:03.944
I'm your grandfather.

00:03.969 --> 00:06.414
I bet you didn't know your mother
could handle a gun, did you?

00:06.439 --> 00:07.201
I'm gonna kill you.

00:07.226 --> 00:08.402
You already have.

00:08.427 --> 00:10.282
There's some men
they came here for me.

00:10.307 --> 00:12.019
- You want my help?
- I'll owe you one.

00:12.044 --> 00:14.441
Max, you don't have
to be scared of me.

00:14.466 --> 00:15.806
I would never hurt you.

00:15.831 --> 00:17.129
You'll always have a home here.

00:17.154 --> 00:18.352
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.002
Don't seem right

00:22.027 --> 00:24.300
burying the sheriff
with that pond scum.

00:24.387 --> 00:25.830
Your father and I
had a deal.

00:25.855 --> 00:27.016
We're not partners.

00:27.041 --> 00:29.342
You may cause me
to rethink my own terms.

00:29.668 --> 00:31.626
So you're a pretend
policeman now?

00:31.651 --> 00:34.880
I just wanted to be
the last face you ever saw.

Not really.

00:50.514 --> 00:53.282
<i>Every week you just sit</i>
<i>in silence on that couch.</i>

00:54.784 --> 00:58.019
- Do you know why you're here?
- I got caught.

00:58.054 --> 01:00.222
No, why you're here
with me.

01:01.991 --> 01:04.259
I have to go through you
to get parole.

01:04.293 --> 01:06.795
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

01:06.829 --> 01:08.964
It's my job
to evaluate you,

01:08.999 --> 01:11.124
the progress
of your rehabilitation.

01:11.158 --> 01:14.653
Come on, you really think
anyone in here gets rehabilitated?

01:14.687 --> 01:16.254
I think we rehabilitate
ourselves.

01:19.290 --> 01:21.791
You've been in here
for what now, seven years?

01:21.825 --> 01:24.691
- Yeah, something like that.
- You've had your share of fights.

01:24.725 --> 01:27.092
It's kind of what
we do in here.

01:27.126 --> 01:29.160
You're eligible for parole
in four months.

01:29.195 --> 01:31.162
I would think a man
of your obvious intelligence

01:31.196 --> 01:33.930
and skill would at least
create the impression

01:33.965 --> 01:35.716
of cooperation with me
to manipulate me into

01:35.741 --> 01:37.433
recommending parole.

01:37.434 --> 01:41.468
Well, maybe I just know
not to bullshit a bullshitter.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.247
<i>Fair enough.</i>

01:42.272 --> 01:44.418
<i>But believe it or not,</i>
<i>I am here to help you.</i>

01:44.738 --> 01:46.104
Yeah, right.

01:46.138 --> 01:48.773
I'm just another file
you got to process

01:48.807 --> 01:51.174
before you go home
to your cats.

01:51.209 --> 01:53.943
What makes you think
I have cats?

01:53.978 --> 01:56.044
Well, I know
you have a cat.

01:56.079 --> 01:58.378
Cats was a guess.

01:58.412 --> 02:00.211
What else?

02:00.246 --> 02:03.847
You're wearing a black bra
under a white blouse again.

02:03.882 --> 02:05.982
It's happened before,

02:06.017 --> 02:09.018
so it's not because you
didn't get your laundry done.

02:09.051 --> 02:11.586
If that were the case,
you'd go with no bra.

02:11.620 --> 02:15.156
<i>Your tits aren't that big.</i>

02:15.190 --> 02:18.124
<i>No, you deliberately</i>
<i>project your sexuality.</i>

02:18.158 --> 02:22.157
Maybe because
of a recent breakup

02:22.192 --> 02:24.092
or a divorce.

02:24.127 --> 02:27.395
<i>Either way, you get off</i>

02:27.430 --> 02:30.131
<i>on sitting across from men </i>
<i>who haven't seen a woman in years</i>

02:30.165 --> 02:31.966
knowing that we're gonna
go back to our cells

02:32.000 --> 02:34.635
and rub one out
thinking of you.

02:34.669 --> 02:38.638
<i>I mean, why else would</i>
<i>a woman that looks like you</i>

02:38.672 --> 02:40.740
work in a place like this?

02:43.343 --> 02:45.778
And, yeah, you have cats.

02:45.812 --> 02:49.547
Every time you wear
dark clothing like that navy pantsuit

02:49.582 --> 02:52.248
that you had tailored to cling
to your ass like a second skin,

02:52.283 --> 02:54.483
I see hairs on you.

02:54.518 --> 02:57.018
You're exceptionally
observant.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.752
- Occupational hazard.
- <i>Of a thief.</i>

02:58.787 --> 03:00.721
- Inmate.
- Are you gonna steal again?

03:00.755 --> 03:01.888
- No.
- Are you sure?

03:01.922 --> 03:04.124
- It's a trick question.
- <i>Why so?</i>

03:04.158 --> 03:06.993
If I say no,
I'm full of shit.

03:07.027 --> 03:09.895
If I say yes,
I don't get parole.

03:09.930 --> 03:13.032
Not everything's a trap.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.036
Never say that to a man
who's living in a cell.

03:19.973 --> 03:21.573
I like you.

03:23.510 --> 03:25.277
Isn't that
against the rules?

03:26.846 --> 03:28.447
Yes.

<i>What happened here?</i>

09:02.187 --> 09:05.222

Hood?
Sheriff Hood!

09:12.762 --> 09:15.363
I don't know what happened.

09:15.397 --> 09:17.231
They just started shooting.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.566
These are
military grade M4s.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.568
That's pretty high-end hardware for
this neck of the woods.

09:23.603 --> 09:25.770
All I care about now
is finding that boy.

09:25.804 --> 09:28.673
No, that's my priority
and that's my jurisdiction.

09:28.707 --> 09:29.983
In my estimation, Sheriff,

09:30.008 --> 09:32.428
you've become an impediment
to this investigation.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.778
I can make a phone call
to a judge

09:34.812 --> 09:37.547
and have a writ within the hour
suspending you from duty.

09:51.433 --> 09:55.369
Hood. Where the hell do you
think you're going?

10:02.010 --> 10:05.946
If you want to stop me,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.258
Let me have your weapon.

10:28.606 --> 10:30.140
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

10:30.174 --> 10:32.475
I'll know it when I see it.

10:32.510 --> 10:34.510
I can help you.

10:34.545 --> 10:36.279
I've lived
my whole life here.

10:36.313 --> 10:39.181
Which explains why you haven't
grasped the concept of personal space.

10:39.216 --> 10:41.617
Just tell me what you got.

10:41.652 --> 10:45.187
<i>This is from the traffic camera</i>
<i>at the county line yesterday morning.</i>

10:45.222 --> 10:47.223
- How do you know that's him?
- New York plates.

10:47.257 --> 10:49.391
And Rabbit usually rolls
four cars deep.

10:49.425 --> 10:51.426
I tried calling our friendly
neighborhood sheriff

10:51.460 --> 10:54.295
<i>to put out an APB,</i>
<i>but he's apparently not taking calls.</i>

10:54.329 --> 10:56.427
<i>At least not mine.</i>

10:56.462 --> 10:58.061
I ran the plates,
they're counterfeit.

10:58.095 --> 11:00.026
But I ain't got no picture
of them leaving.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.127
- They're here.
- Think he's okay?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.662
<i>He's not okay.</i>

11:04.696 --> 11:07.330
<i>If Rabbit's here,</i>
<i>no one's okay.</i>

11:09.032 --> 11:11.200
<i>I told him, man.</i>
<i>I said over and over again</i>

11:11.234 --> 11:13.267
<i>we need to get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

11:13.302 --> 11:15.968
<i>This has never been anything</i>
<i>but a terrible idea.</i>

11:16.003 --> 11:18.671
How do we find the boy?

11:18.705 --> 11:21.541
We hack into street cameras,
we look for the cars.

11:21.575 --> 11:23.643
We review security footage
from mini-marts

11:23.678 --> 11:25.912
and supermarkets--
someone had to do a food run.

11:25.947 --> 11:28.115
We reroute spy satellites
from the CIA

11:28.149 --> 11:31.085
and look for heat signatures
where they shouldn't be.

11:31.119 --> 11:35.456
This is a tiny needle
in a big motherfucking haystack.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.224
There's just too much
ground to cover.

11:37.259 --> 11:40.628
<i>I need 20 men doing this</i>
<i>and I ain't got 'em.</i>

11:40.662 --> 11:42.530
It's just us two.

11:53.256 --> 11:55.933
Or us three.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.118
Hey, Job.

12:02.152 --> 12:03.757
Long time.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.768
Gang's all here.

12:17.645 --> 12:19.613
Please.

12:19.648 --> 12:21.415
Keep trying.

12:50.658 --> 12:53.293
You know they're just here
to keep us safe.

12:55.129 --> 12:56.963
Hey.

12:56.998 --> 12:59.099
You okay?

13:09.477 --> 13:13.781
Deva, I'm sorry
about all this.

13:15.518 --> 13:18.086
Why would she
lie to us?

13:23.961 --> 13:27.230
Everything's not going
to be all right, is it?

13:30.969 --> 13:33.939
I don't know, honey.

13:34.006 --> 13:35.874
I honestly don't.

14:11.376 --> 14:13.508
I must admit

14:13.542 --> 14:17.043
you have an admirable
knack for survival.

14:19.813 --> 14:22.015
I'm already dead.

14:23.184 --> 14:25.718
- I know that.
- <i>Yes?</i>

14:26.920 --> 14:29.255
So why do you resist?

14:30.457 --> 14:33.126
You haven't offered
any other options.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.395
<i>Such as?</i>

14:39.300 --> 14:40.933
Surrender.

14:42.168 --> 14:45.137
You would sacrifice
yourself for the boy?

14:49.709 --> 14:51.576
No.

14:54.047 --> 14:55.883
For all of them.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.557
So...

14:58.591 --> 15:00.660
finally you admit

15:00.694 --> 15:03.230
your responsibility
in all of this.

15:06.735 --> 15:08.970
Yes, I do.

15:26.414 --> 15:28.315
<i>Uncle Kai?</i>

15:29.183 --> 15:32.018
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:33.554 --> 15:35.988

<i>of wine downstairs.</i>

15:38.025 --> 15:41.427

15:41.461 --> 15:44.197
So good night.

15:45.633 --> 15:47.867
Good night, Rebecca.

16:35.276 --> 16:36.709
Ah!

16:54.125 --> 16:55.425
Who sent you?

16:58.095 --> 17:00.363
Fucking Indians.

17:47.803 --> 17:49.270
<i>Go help your uncle.</i>

18:07.722 --> 18:09.757
<i>You've been in a fight.</i>

18:09.791 --> 18:11.827
Just a misunderstanding.

18:11.861 --> 18:13.898
Do you want to tell me
about it?

18:13.932 --> 18:16.567
Someone had a crush on me,

18:16.601 --> 18:18.903
I just wanted to be friends.

18:37.256 --> 18:39.691
- Are we done?
- Not quite.

18:45.231 --> 18:47.998
Must be exhausting.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.801
What?

18:51.503 --> 18:53.737
Being on guard
24 hours a day.

18:53.771 --> 18:56.173
<i>Wondering where the next</i>
<i>attack is gonna come from.</i>

18:58.643 --> 19:01.145
Can you ever rest?

19:05.517 --> 19:08.319
I've been looking at
your initial police report.

19:10.389 --> 19:12.757
There were two of you
in that building.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.662
The police said that you had
made it as far as the woods

19:17.697 --> 19:20.237
where your chance of escape
would be much greater,

19:20.271 --> 19:22.710
<i>but yet you turned around.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

19:28.850 --> 19:30.985
Your accomplice...

19:33.455 --> 19:35.089
it was a woman.

19:39.027 --> 19:42.096
<i>These sessions are confidential</i>
<i>and inadmissible in court.</i>

19:42.130 --> 19:44.398
<i>You can't incriminate her.</i>

19:47.836 --> 19:50.338
You must have loved her
very much.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.610
<i>And you haven't seen</i>
<i>or heard from her since?</i>

20:01.883 --> 20:03.917
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

21:01.642 --> 21:03.977
You okay?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.113
Yeah.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.918
So where you been?

21:11.953 --> 21:14.554
You know, around.

21:17.482 --> 21:19.714
Will you stay
for awhile

21:19.749 --> 21:22.080
now that he's gone?

21:25.648 --> 21:27.652
I could really use you.

21:29.156 --> 21:31.422
Well, that's not really
my bag, big brother.

22:02.891 --> 22:04.557
Ugh.

22:04.592 --> 22:06.424
Well, this is interesting.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.258
Oh, that motherfucker!

22:08.292 --> 22:10.425
<i>This is my home.</i>

22:10.459 --> 22:12.992
So you're upset
that the man

22:13.026 --> 22:15.359
who cut off the head
of the guy

22:15.393 --> 22:18.693
you sent to kill him
isn't respecting your privacy?

22:22.760 --> 22:24.192
What's this?

22:28.294 --> 22:30.427
It's one of ours.

22:36.094 --> 22:38.027
I'm thinking

22:38.061 --> 22:40.661
maybe I will stick around
for a while.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.899
This man will take
you home, Max.

23:28.267 --> 23:29.933
It's okay, Max.

23:32.101 --> 23:33.700
Hey.

23:36.068 --> 23:37.867
No one's gonna hurt you.

23:40.202 --> 23:42.235
Go.

23:56.206 --> 23:59.239
You trusted me
to keep my word?

24:01.808 --> 24:03.274
You always have.

24:13.613 --> 24:17.279
<i>Your call has been directed</i>

24:39.953 --> 24:43.153
<i>It's okay.</i>

24:46.455 --> 24:48.255
Gordon.

24:48.290 --> 24:49.855
<i>Sugar.</i>

24:49.890 --> 24:52.122
What are you doing here?

24:55.524 --> 24:56.990
We got Max back.

24:57.024 --> 24:59.424
What? What do you mean?
How is he?

24:59.492 --> 25:02.458
He's safe.
He and Deva are with the FBI.

25:02.492 --> 25:04.225
He came home
a little while ago.

25:04.259 --> 25:06.492
- How?
- <i>He just rang the doorbell.</i>

25:06.527 --> 25:08.859
Said that they dropped
him off a block away from the house.

25:08.894 --> 25:12.127
I don't understand.

25:12.161 --> 25:14.595
What do you mean?
They just--

25:15.835 --> 25:18.372
they just dropped him off
just like that?

25:18.407 --> 25:20.842
No, not just like that.

25:22.278 --> 25:25.214
Your father told him
to tell you something.

25:25.248 --> 25:26.982
What?

25:28.451 --> 25:31.553
He said that you
were forgiven.

25:35.291 --> 25:38.692
- Hood.
- Max said they have him.

25:40.293 --> 25:42.259
He traded himself
for Max.

25:42.293 --> 25:44.928
I don't understand why Hood
would think that that's something--

25:44.962 --> 25:46.996
His cell phone.

25:49.133 --> 25:51.634
- What?
- I got a tracker on his cell phone.

25:51.669 --> 25:52.827
There you are.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.137
<i>What is that?</i>
<i>Where is that?</i>

25:54.138 --> 25:57.240
<i>The Bottoms near</i>
<i>the North Valley Woods.</i>

25:57.275 --> 25:59.542
What the fuck are the Bottoms?
What's out there?

25:59.577 --> 26:02.178
Well, nothing
that I can think of.

26:02.213 --> 26:04.448
Wait.

26:04.482 --> 26:07.584
The metalworks.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.921
We've been here all day
looking at these maps,

26:10.954 --> 26:12.988
moving satellites around
in outer fucking space,

26:13.023 --> 26:14.989
and then he says,
"Wait, wait, the metalworks."

26:15.024 --> 26:17.691
<i>Well, the Bottoms</i>
<i>aren't on most maps.</i>

26:17.726 --> 26:20.327
Is that it?
Is that it right there?

26:20.361 --> 26:21.895
Yeah.

26:27.034 --> 26:29.236
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26:29.270 --> 26:31.471
You call the FBI
and you let them handle this.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.173
- I can't.
- <i>You have to.</i>

26:33.207 --> 26:35.308
Now, I don't know what
Hood's role in all this is,

26:35.343 --> 26:37.266
<i>but we have two children</i>

26:37.291 --> 26:39.611
<i>whose lives have been</i>
<i>turned upside down.</i>

26:39.613 --> 26:43.649
Now, nothing and no one else
is more important than that.

26:49.690 --> 26:52.324
Come on, man.
Come on.

26:56.730 --> 26:59.198
Now, you lied to me.

26:59.232 --> 27:01.700
You lied to our kids.

27:01.734 --> 27:03.668
I don't know if you can
ever make that right,

27:03.703 --> 27:05.637
but if you're gonna try,

27:05.671 --> 27:08.473
you need to come home
with me right now.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.508
Gordon, don't do this.

27:12.845 --> 27:14.446
Don't make me choose.

27:14.480 --> 27:17.783
You go with them, you're
making that choice yourself.

27:23.790 --> 27:25.457
Um, what are you doing?

27:25.492 --> 27:28.394
Look, I've seen you drive.
Get in.

27:40.074 --> 27:42.342
We're probably gonna die.

27:44.578 --> 27:46.679
Probably.

27:49.016 --> 27:50.483
If we do die,

27:50.517 --> 27:53.252
I just want you to know
I don't like you very much.

27:58.458 --> 28:00.293
Duly noted.

28:00.327 --> 28:02.962
Well, if you're going
to drive, then drive.

28:02.996 --> 28:05.197
I want to be dead
or home by morning.

28:20.445 --> 28:21.980
Just drive.

28:29.489 --> 28:32.390
So your parole hearing
is in two weeks.

28:32.424 --> 28:34.292
Do you feel ready?

28:35.627 --> 28:38.663
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I think so.

28:38.697 --> 28:41.132
I know you're ready
to get out of here.

28:42.868 --> 28:44.836
You think
they'll let me out?

28:44.870 --> 28:47.472
You present as intelligent
and capable,

28:47.506 --> 28:49.641
as remorseful
and articulate.

28:49.676 --> 28:51.796
Plus, you have the single
best psych eval ever written

28:51.811 --> 28:53.979
in the history
of the prison system, so...

28:55.949 --> 28:58.250
Thank you.

28:58.285 --> 29:00.152
I just wish...

29:00.187 --> 29:02.288
What?

29:02.322 --> 29:04.123
Nothing.

29:04.157 --> 29:05.958
- <i>Come on, what?</i>
- Nothing, no. I'm sorry.

29:05.992 --> 29:08.060
- <i>I forgot myself for a moment.</i>
- It's our last session.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.328
You're never
gonna see me again.

29:13.365 --> 29:16.401
Um, I was gonna say
I just wish

29:16.435 --> 29:18.836
we had met under
different circumstances.

29:21.106 --> 29:23.574
I know it's
a pathetic cliché.

29:23.609 --> 29:26.745
No, no.
It's not.

29:28.315 --> 29:31.083
Um, you saved me in here.

29:32.719 --> 29:34.486
Are you scared?

29:34.520 --> 29:36.422
Terrified.

29:37.691 --> 29:40.229
Are you gonna see Ana
when you get out?

29:40.264 --> 29:42.033
Uh, yeah.

29:42.067 --> 29:45.670
Yeah, I've got a few places
I think I can...

29:49.675 --> 29:51.543
look for her.

29:55.315 --> 29:58.518
- Who are you?
- What?

29:59.853 --> 30:01.921
Who the fuck are you?

30:03.724 --> 30:05.458
I never told you her name.

30:07.394 --> 30:10.029
Mr. Rabbit
has a message for you.

30:11.198 --> 30:13.533
Mr. Rabbit says
there'll be no parole.

30:13.567 --> 30:15.602
<i>You will serve out</i>
<i>the remaining eight years.</i>

30:15.637 --> 30:16.452
And he wants you to know

30:16.477 --> 30:18.477
that when you do get out,
he'll be waiting for you.

30:18.674 --> 30:22.544
<i>There's nowhere you can go</i>
<i>that he won't find you.</i>

30:22.578 --> 30:24.846
Help me!

30:24.881 --> 30:26.949
Guard, help me!

30:31.555 --> 30:34.624
- Get off! Get off!
- Oh, God!

30:52.276 --> 30:56.445
It's funny
being here with you.

30:58.282 --> 31:01.718
I think of all that time
we were together,

31:01.752 --> 31:03.887
the three of us.

31:07.992 --> 31:09.560
We were a family.

31:09.594 --> 31:11.762
Don't kid yourself.

31:12.964 --> 31:14.998
We were never
a family.

31:15.033 --> 31:19.898
Me and Ana,
we were family.

31:21.099 --> 31:22.599
Not you.

31:22.633 --> 31:26.202
I think maybe we both
kid ourselves sometimes.

31:26.237 --> 31:28.137
Oh, fuck you.

31:28.172 --> 31:31.274
You betrayed me for love.

31:31.308 --> 31:33.276
Then you got out
of prison

31:33.310 --> 31:35.611
to find your love
had betrayed you.

31:35.646 --> 31:38.546
And then a few days ago,

31:38.581 --> 31:41.182
she barters your life
for her own.

31:43.751 --> 31:46.186
My daughter is better
at punishing you

31:46.220 --> 31:48.421
than I could ever be.

31:50.657 --> 31:52.958
However,

31:52.993 --> 31:55.094
a man can still try.

32:16.551 --> 32:18.219
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

32:19.654 --> 32:21.122
What is it?

32:21.156 --> 32:23.891
Shit. I don't know.

32:23.925 --> 32:25.960
Shit!

32:25.994 --> 32:27.728
Were you speeding?

32:27.763 --> 32:29.931
I knew I shouldn't
have let you drive.

32:45.782 --> 32:47.850
Evening, folks.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.888
<i>Mrs. Hopewell, I don't know</i>
<i>if you heard yet,</i>

32:52.922 --> 32:55.123
<i>but your son</i>
<i>turned up safe.</i>

32:55.158 --> 32:57.359
I know.
Thank you.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.362
And...

33:01.798 --> 33:04.600
<i>you--</i>

33:04.635 --> 33:07.036
you three are clearly
not going to a PTA meeting.

33:07.071 --> 33:09.205
Can you step out of the car,
Mrs. Hopewell?

33:16.714 --> 33:18.815
<i>There.</i>

33:18.850 --> 33:20.517
That's better, right?

33:41.872 --> 33:45.407
You took my only
daughter from me.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.811
There are no words
to express the pain.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.380
The rage I feel.

33:52.414 --> 33:55.015
Oh, believe me,

33:55.050 --> 33:58.052
she couldn't get away
from you fast enough.

34:19.074 --> 34:21.909
<i>She hated you</i>

34:21.944 --> 34:25.280
more than she ever
loved me.

34:26.581 --> 34:29.150
You're right.

34:29.184 --> 34:32.650
I took your little girl.

34:32.685 --> 34:34.686
And there is nothing

34:34.719 --> 34:36.955
that you can do to me

34:36.989 --> 34:39.024
that can ever change that.

34:39.058 --> 34:42.193
At least I can watch you
pay for your betrayal.

34:42.226 --> 34:45.260
Why don't you shut the fuck up
and get on with it?

34:59.135 --> 35:02.162
We got the call.
What's going on?

35:02.196 --> 35:04.394
She's telling me that Hood
has been kidnapped

35:04.429 --> 35:06.095
by the same guys
that took her son.

35:06.129 --> 35:08.094
He wasn't kidnapped.

35:08.129 --> 35:11.058
He traded himself for Max.

35:11.092 --> 35:13.056
And they're gonna kill him
if I don't get over there.

35:13.091 --> 35:15.211
Look, if Hood is in trouble,
why wouldn't you call us?

35:15.221 --> 35:16.987
Because I can't
involve you in this.

35:17.021 --> 35:19.581
It's an abduction and you can't involve
the sheriff's department?

35:19.590 --> 35:20.923
<i>That's kind of strange,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

35:20.958 --> 35:22.124
<i>You think that's strange?</i>

35:22.158 --> 35:24.993
<i>Take a look at who</i>
<i>she called instead.</i>

35:27.629 --> 35:30.430
Oh, and Mrs. Hopewell
was strapped with these.

35:30.464 --> 35:32.431
<i>Two Springfield DX9s.</i>

35:32.466 --> 35:35.200
You want to tell us
what the hell's going on?

35:37.369 --> 35:40.969
The man who has Hood
is a gangster named Rabbit.

35:41.003 --> 35:42.770
He and I have a history.

35:42.804 --> 35:45.305
It's me he's here for.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.207
That's why he took Max.

35:47.242 --> 35:49.877
He's got a small army with him
and he's not gonna think twice

35:49.911 --> 35:53.513
about killing you or me or anyone else
who gets in his way.

35:53.547 --> 35:57.149
Well, what were you and the
A-Team over here planning to do?

36:02.087 --> 36:04.688
He's going to kill him.
He may already have.

36:04.722 --> 36:06.489
Please, we are wasting
time right now.

36:06.524 --> 36:08.491
This-- this is crazy.

36:08.526 --> 36:10.493
Sorry, I don't--

36:10.528 --> 36:13.363
- You're the sheriff.
- I know I am.

36:17.334 --> 36:18.434
What?

36:18.468 --> 36:21.270
If it was you they had,
or any one of us,

36:21.304 --> 36:23.372
what do you think
Hood would do?

36:34.516 --> 36:36.183
Shit.

36:42.490 --> 36:44.591
I don't care what kind
of gangsters they are.

36:44.625 --> 36:46.626
They picked
the wrong fucking town.

36:48.496 --> 36:50.631
Well, all right.

37:08.781 --> 37:11.717
- You sure about this?
- Do I look sure?

37:19.826 --> 37:22.260
Gregor, tell the men
to start packing up.

37:22.295 --> 37:24.062
<i>We're leaving soon.</i>

37:43.651 --> 37:46.286
When I was a teenager...

37:47.889 --> 37:50.991
I found two boys
in a field.

37:52.193 --> 37:54.694
They had tied
a stray dog to a tree

37:54.728 --> 37:57.663
and they were beating it
with sticks.

38:01.133 --> 38:04.835
<i>He was badly hurt,</i>
<i>bleeding.</i>

38:06.171 --> 38:08.639
<i>His front leg was broken.</i>

38:08.673 --> 38:12.008
After I finished
with the boys...

38:14.345 --> 38:17.447
I decided I would care
for the dog.

38:19.717 --> 38:22.819
But when I went
to untie him,

38:22.853 --> 38:25.055
he bit my leg.

38:25.089 --> 38:27.757
<i>The dog meant me no harm.</i>

38:27.791 --> 38:30.595
He was acting on instinct.
I knew that.

38:30.630 --> 38:33.599
But I also knew
I had to kill him...

38:35.736 --> 38:38.037
because I, too,

38:38.072 --> 38:41.675
was acting on instinct.

38:43.011 --> 38:45.315
We're all animals, really.

39:03.115 --> 39:05.219
Gentlemen.

39:11.603 --> 39:13.072
Who the fuck are you?

39:13.106 --> 39:16.616
I'm gonna need you
to open this here gate.

39:19.288 --> 39:22.257
This is private property.
No one enters.

39:22.292 --> 39:26.263
Oh, honey, if I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.799
Now open
the motherfucking gate.

39:30.668 --> 39:31.701
Fuck you.

39:31.735 --> 39:34.404
Oh, it's gonna
be like that, is it?

39:37.142 --> 39:41.246
Eenie meenie
miney mo.

39:43.450 --> 39:45.884
My bad.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.293
Nice shooting.

39:54.328 --> 39:56.095
I've been taking lessons.

40:13.081 --> 40:14.561
I should have killed you
15 years ago.

40:15.916 --> 40:19.687
But there was a part of me
that hoped that you'd--

40:19.721 --> 40:21.956
both of you--

40:21.990 --> 40:24.091
would change your minds.

40:30.933 --> 40:33.000
All right, hold up.
Hold up.

40:33.034 --> 40:35.303
The only entrance
to this place is on the other side.

40:35.337 --> 40:36.971
We're gonna be outnumbered
and outgunned.

40:37.005 --> 40:39.640
We have to surprise them.
I'll create a diversion.

40:39.675 --> 40:41.776
You guys go up front
and wait for my signal.

40:41.810 --> 40:43.211
And then what?
What's your plan?

40:43.245 --> 40:46.014
Save Hood,
shoot everybody else.

40:46.048 --> 40:50.685
Like you,
I was blinded by love.

41:01.231 --> 41:03.165
No.

41:05.368 --> 41:07.970
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about love.</i>

41:08.938 --> 41:12.841
We spent two years

41:12.875 --> 41:16.111
figuring out
how to fuck you over.

41:22.786 --> 41:25.120
<i>And we did.</i>

41:26.222 --> 41:29.558
That's why you're angry.

41:29.592 --> 41:31.994
'Cause you got played.

41:33.396 --> 41:35.331
<i>So do me a favor.</i>

41:35.365 --> 41:38.001
Stop whining

41:38.035 --> 41:40.303
about fucking love.

41:40.338 --> 41:42.639
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what love is.</i>

41:45.710 --> 41:48.578
You're wrong.

41:57.257 --> 41:59.425
This...

41:59.459 --> 42:02.428
is love.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.542
Go now! Go, go!

42:15.576 --> 42:16.976
Fuck!

42:20.849 --> 42:22.916
Sugar!

42:22.950 --> 42:24.451
Sugar!

42:24.485 --> 42:25.953
Go!

42:40.135 --> 42:42.369
I knew she'd come
for you.

42:42.404 --> 42:44.639
Now she can watch
you die.

42:46.375 --> 42:48.776
Yes!

43:19.941 --> 43:22.108
Brock!

43:22.143 --> 43:23.476
Motherfucker!

43:23.511 --> 43:24.811
Brock's hit.

43:24.845 --> 43:26.446
I know. There's no way
I can get to him.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.948
He's too far away.
Go around and I'll cover you.

44:02.514 --> 44:04.449
I'm running out of ammo!

44:16.028 --> 44:18.429
God damn it!
Emmett!

44:22.265 --> 44:24.600
<i>Shit, I'm running out.</i>

44:59.871 --> 45:01.305
How you doing?

45:01.339 --> 45:04.442
Oh, fuck, that hurts.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.747
- Sugar?
- He's okay. He's over there.

45:09.649 --> 45:11.250
I'm fine.

45:12.619 --> 45:14.287
- Did we win?
- We didn't lose.

45:30.638 --> 45:32.772
Suck my tit.

46:03.438 --> 46:05.038
Stay away from him.

46:05.073 --> 46:07.908
I forgave you.

46:07.942 --> 46:10.810
<i>I gave you back your son.</i>

46:13.480 --> 46:15.581
Well, I never forgave you.

46:18.987 --> 46:21.422
So what now,

46:21.456 --> 46:23.557
<i>clever girl?</i>

46:24.459 --> 46:26.093
Good-bye, Daddy.

46:47.682 --> 46:49.783
Hey. Let me see you.

46:49.817 --> 46:51.951
Oh, God.

46:51.986 --> 46:53.519
Oh, my God.

46:58.726 --> 47:00.394
My God.

47:00.428 --> 47:01.928
Max?

47:01.963 --> 47:04.431
He's safe.
He's okay.

47:10.605 --> 47:13.741
Next time, I say
we just run away.

47:13.775 --> 47:16.310
Hang on, okay?

47:20.182 --> 47:22.650

50:30.273 --> 50:31.874
Hey, boss.

50:37.147 --> 50:39.482
Listen, Janie.

50:39.516 --> 50:41.951
I'm sorry that I've been
so distant.

50:41.985 --> 50:44.955
You know, I've just been so
obsessed with taking down Proctor.

50:44.989 --> 50:47.157
I never meant
to shut you out.

50:47.192 --> 50:48.592
He's everywhere,
you know?

50:48.627 --> 50:51.295
I worked with the Kinaho
to try to get this new casino built

50:51.329 --> 50:53.364
and now he has his hands
in that, too.

50:53.398 --> 50:56.934
That's the hotel.

50:56.968 --> 50:59.971
And on the northern side
will be the casino.

51:00.005 --> 51:02.107
That's why Longshadow
wanted you killed?

51:02.141 --> 51:03.641
Yeah.

51:03.676 --> 51:06.511
So now what?

51:07.680 --> 51:10.048
Well, I could
just get rid of Alex,

51:10.083 --> 51:13.185
but that would create a power vacuum
within the tribe

51:13.220 --> 51:16.155
and there's no telling
who would take over.

51:16.189 --> 51:19.492
Better let Alex understand
who his friends are.

51:21.861 --> 51:23.960
And how do we do that?

51:26.763 --> 51:29.231
We could start
with a phone call.

51:34.737 --> 51:37.038
You just hit send.

51:48.350 --> 51:50.518
Hello?

51:52.187 --> 51:54.556
Is anyone here?

52:05.668 --> 52:09.271
Well, I guess we'll have to settle
for leaving a message.

52:20.083 --> 52:24.220
<i>♪ I'll take these wings</i>

52:24.254 --> 52:29.225

<i>yay, yay. ♪</i>

52:52.650 --> 52:54.752
Any word on Rabbit?

52:56.454 --> 52:59.891
The FBI turned
the woods upside down.

52:59.925 --> 53:02.494
Full-on search grids,
dogs, the works.

53:02.528 --> 53:04.205
So far, the theory is that

53:04.230 --> 53:06.112
he crawled into a hole
somewhere and died.

53:08.367 --> 53:10.801
Hey.

53:10.836 --> 53:13.437
- They'll find him.
- Yeah.

53:18.076 --> 53:20.011
There.

53:20.045 --> 53:21.712
Now that's what
a sheriff looks like.

53:24.283 --> 53:26.484
When do you have
to change it again?

53:28.487 --> 53:30.823
Tomorrow.

53:30.857 --> 53:32.691
All right, then.

53:32.726 --> 53:35.494
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:36.663 --> 53:38.831
Thanks.

54:15.336 --> 54:17.271
Deputy Yawners.

54:18.774 --> 54:20.441
Agent Xavier.

54:20.476 --> 54:22.910
One of the two active
officers of the BSD.

54:22.945 --> 54:25.346
How long you plan
to keep us on a leash?

54:25.380 --> 54:27.615
I don't like this
any better than you do.

54:27.650 --> 54:30.619
But Sheriff Hood, his behavior
throughout all this

54:30.653 --> 54:31.831
has been somewhere between

54:31.856 --> 54:33.650
highly questionable
and outright criminal.

54:33.857 --> 54:36.425
And what went down
at the metalworks,

54:36.459 --> 54:38.494
that's gonna take
some time to sort out.

54:38.528 --> 54:41.096
The Bureau is assigning
a special investigator.

54:41.131 --> 54:42.474
Look, in the meantime,

54:42.499 --> 54:44.619
you're just gonna have to
deal with federal oversight.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.904
So, never a dull moment
around here, huh?

54:49.939 --> 54:53.007
Couple of hunters
found them this morning.

54:53.042 --> 54:54.975
Based on the level
of decomposition,

54:55.010 --> 54:56.844

56:30.841 --> 56:33.543
Hi, it's Jason Hood.

56:35.179 --> 56:37.147
I was wondering
if you had heard

56:37.181 --> 56:38.849
from my old man at all.

56:40.418 --> 56:42.319
<i>Sorry, Jason.</i>
<i>Still nothing.</i>

56:42.353 --> 56:44.688
All right.

56:44.722 --> 56:46.356
Thanks anyways.

56:57.568 --> 56:59.636
Fuck me.
