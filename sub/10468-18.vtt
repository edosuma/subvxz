OK. ALL RIGHT, BYE.

00:08.747 --> 00:11.011
ANOTHER SATISFIED
CUSTOMER.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.099
HEY, GUS.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.187
HEY.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.840
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE FOR A WHILE.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.059
WELL, I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,

00:16.059 --> 00:17.408
BUT I COULD
GET USED TO THIS.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.237
I JUST TOOK MY GRANDSON
TO A BALL GAME,

00:20.237 --> 00:22.848
PLAYED 36 HOLES
AT PEBBLE BEACH--

00:22.848 --> 00:23.849
AND TRUST ME,
IT'S EASIER

00:23.849 --> 00:25.895
TO GET TEE TIME
DURING THE WEEK.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.071
WELL, YOU'VE EARNED IT.

00:28.071 --> 00:30.900
THAT'S, UH,
KIND OF WHY I CAME IN.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.470
I GOT A CALL FROM
STANDARD HOME FURNISHINGS
LAST WEEK.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.602
THEY WANT TO
BUY ME OUT, CHARLIE.

00:37.602 --> 00:40.388
S.F.?

00:40.388 --> 00:42.694
WHAT HAPPENED, WE STOLE
THE MILL VALLEY JOB,

00:42.694 --> 00:45.958
AND THEY FIGURED
IF YOU CAN'T
BEAT 'EM...

00:47.569 --> 00:49.614
WAIT, GUS,
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY--

00:49.614 --> 00:51.747
WELL, YOU GOT
TO FACE FACTS, CHARLIE,

00:51.747 --> 00:54.793
I'M NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.404
HOLD ON, I DON'T--
I DON'T GET IT.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.232
I MEAN WE'RE JUST
STARTING TO TURN
THINGS AROUND HERE.

00:58.232 --> 01:02.323
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHY NOW
IS THE PERFECT TIME
TO SELL.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.807
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

01:08.807 --> 01:10.374
NOW, WE TALK EVERY WEEK,

01:10.374 --> 01:13.116
AND YOU NEVER ONCE
MENTIONED A WORD
ABOUT WANTING TO SELL.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.727
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
I'D GET THE RIGHT PRICE.

01:15.727 --> 01:17.207
BUT NOW, THANKS TO YOU--

01:17.207 --> 01:19.122
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
WHAT BOTHERS ME, GUS.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.471
I MEAN, YOU ASK ME
TO RUN THE PLACE,

01:20.471 --> 01:22.560
AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY
PULL THE RUG OUT LIKE THIS?

01:22.560 --> 01:25.041
LOOK, RELAX. THOSE GUYS
KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.217
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE YOU
A VERY NICE OFFER
TO STAY.

01:27.217 --> 01:29.219
THAT'S NOT IT, GUS.
THAT'S NOT IT.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.619
I'VE GOT PLANS HERE,
YOU KNOW.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.099
I MEAN, WE'RE JUST
INTO PRODUCTION

01:39.099 --> 01:40.100
ON THE BEDROOM LINE NOW,

01:47.672 --> 01:50.371
IT'LL JUST BE

01:50.371 --> 01:53.287
THEY HAVE MUCH DEEPER
POCKETS THAN I HAVE.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.985
IF ANYTHING, YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO DO MORE.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.509
IT'S THE BEST THING,
CHARLIE,

@UH, WELL,

@AND, UM, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

04:37.712 --> 04:38.800
@EXCUSE ME?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.106
@WHO SAID EVERYTHING@HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING?

04:43.413 --> 04:44.588
@WELL, THAT KIND@OF SOUNDS LIKE

04:44.588 --> 04:46.111
@A RULE ITSELF,@DON'T YOU THINK?

04:46.111 --> 04:47.722
@THE POINT IS,@IS THAT I DON'T THINK

04:47.722 --> 04:49.637
@I CAN TELL YOU THE RULES.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.901
@ANYMORE THAN YOU@CAN TELL ME.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.441
@LET'S STOP HERE@FOR A SECOND

05:11.441 --> 05:13.356
@'CAUSE WE HAVE QUITE@A LIST ALREADY.@OK.

05:13.356 --> 05:16.141
@LET'S TRY TO NARROW@THIS DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.101
@LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE@YOU'VE BEEN HEADED SO FAR.

05:19.101 --> 05:20.407
@WHAT'S YOUR DEGREE?

05:20.407 --> 05:24.019
@UM, ACTUALLY,@I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE

05:24.019 --> 05:25.194
@MY SOPHOMORE YEAR.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.326
@REALLY, WELL--

05:26.326 --> 05:28.458
@BUT, DON'T WORRY.@I'VE GOT A GREAT RESUM .

05:28.458 --> 05:30.242
@I RAN MY FAMILY'S@RESTAURANT BUSINESS

05:30.242 --> 05:31.940
@FOR OVER 2 YEARS.@@THE FAMILY BUSINESS?

05:31.940 --> 05:34.029
@YES, AND I@COMPLETELY TURNED@THAT PLACE AROUND.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.160
@I CAN PRINT UP@THE FINANCIALS.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.598
@I'M GONNA HAVE@TO INTERRUPT.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.860
@YOU NEED A DEGREE.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.427
@BUT I'M SAYING

05:40.427 --> 05:42.559
@THE AVERAGE BUSINESS@SCHOOL GRADUATE KNOWS@LESS THAN ME.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.779
@YES, BUT THAT'S@NOT HOW THEY HIRE.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.389
@THE FIRST THING THEY ASK ME,

05:46.389 --> 05:47.564
@IS "WHAT'S HIS DEGREE?"

05:47.564 --> 05:50.872
@I JUST--I CAN'T BELIEVE@THAT IF THEY MET ME

05:50.872 --> 05:52.656
@AND THEN THEY'VE@HEARD ABOUT EVERYTHING@THAT I'VE DONE--

05:52.656 --> 05:54.919
@IT DOESN'T MATTER@WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.138
@WITHOUT THAT@PIECE OF PAPER,

05:56.138 --> 05:58.009
@I CAN'T EVEN@GET YOU IN THE DOOR.

06:16.071 --> 06:19.466
@SO, WITH OUR SALES@AND DISTRIBUTION,

06:19.466 --> 06:21.772
@PRODUCERS LIKE YOU@ARE JUST FREE TO BUILD.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.078
@TAKE YOUR MIND OFF@THE HASSLES

06:23.078 --> 06:25.776
@THAT MOST INDEPENDENTS@GET SWAMPED BY.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.909
@HOW'S THAT SOUND?

06:27.909 --> 06:30.433
@UH, IT SOUNDS GREAT.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.826
@IT REALLY DOES.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.393
@AND, UH, BY THE WAY,@THANK YOU.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.133
@I REALLY APPRECIATE@ALL THIS TROUBLE.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.134
@IT'S NO TROUBLE.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.788
WE WANT YOU TO BE
PART OF STANDARD.

06:37.788 --> 06:38.789
DID YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO LOOK OVER

06:38.789 --> 06:40.443
THE SALARY
AND BENEFITS PACKAGE?

06:40.443 --> 06:41.444
YEAH, YEAH,

06:41.444 --> 06:43.403
AND, UM,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.753
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.058
IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

06:47.058 --> 06:48.799
I SENSE A "BUT."

06:48.799 --> 06:51.019
NO, NO, IT'S JUST, UH...

06:53.369 --> 06:55.371
THE MAIN REASON
THAT I TOOK OVER FOR GUS,

06:55.371 --> 06:58.156
WAS SO I COULD
BUILD CERTAIN THINGS.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.332
TERRIFIC. THAT'S
WHY WE WANT YOU.

07:00.332 --> 07:01.377
WE LIKE WHAT
YOU'RE BUILDING.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.684
WELL, THERE'S
OTHER STUFF, TOO.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.729
DESIGNS THAT ARE STILL
ON THE DRAWING BOARD.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.991
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THEM.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.689
JUST PUT TOGETHER
A PORTFOLIO

07:08.689 --> 07:10.821
AND WE'LL RUN IT
BY THE E.D.G.

07:10.821 --> 07:13.737
THE--THE E.D.G.?

07:13.737 --> 07:15.086
OUR EXECUTIVE DESIGN
GROUP.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.393
THEY REVIEW ALL
OF OUR PRODUCT LINES.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.395
I NEED THEIR APPROVAL
BEFORE I CAN BUILD ANYTHING?

07:19.395 --> 07:22.093
DON'T WORRY. THE GROUP
JUST HELPS US TRACK
BUYER PREFERENCES.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.660
SO ONCE THEY'VE
SIGNED OFF,

07:23.660 --> 07:25.140
THEN THAT'S IT.
I'M ON MY OWN.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.315
WELL, ACTUALLY,

07:26.315 --> 07:27.664
MARKETING HAS
TO SIGN OFF, TOO.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.231
BUT THAT'S
JUST A FORMALITY.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.232
PROVIDED, OF COURSE,

07:30.232 --> 07:31.668
CONSUMER TESTING
GOES WELL.

07:41.025 --> 07:44.507
5 WHOLE DAYS
IN THE BIG APPLE.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.639
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.163
YOU SHOULD DO
SOMETHING FUN, YOU KNOW?

07:48.163 --> 07:49.425
GO TO A GREAT JAZZ CLUB,

07:49.425 --> 07:51.383
OR, SEE IF WOODY
IS PLAYING ELAINE'S.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.602
LIKE WHEN?
I'M GONNA BE LOCKED

07:52.602 --> 07:54.561
IN A SMELLY
RECORDING STUDIO

07:54.561 --> 07:57.041
WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER
SESSION GEEKS.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.260
TOLD THE SAME THING
TO MABEL

07:58.260 --> 08:00.392
WHEN SHE SAID
WE SHOULD GO OUT.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.437
WHO'S MABEL?

08:01.437 --> 08:04.614
OH, JUST THIS GIRL
I KNOW THERE.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.312
GIRL?

08:07.312 --> 08:09.837
SHE'S THE CELLIST
THAT WE'RE USING.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.361
OH, OK.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.841
YOU KNOW,
YOU NEVER MENTIONED HER.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.799
WELL, WE'RE
OLD FRIENDS AND, UM,

08:15.799 --> 08:16.931
WE GREW UP TOGETHER

08:16.931 --> 08:19.107
AND THEN SHE MOVED
TO NEW YORK FOR WORK.

08:19.107 --> 08:20.195
WHAT WORK?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.501
MODELING.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.458
TODD.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.068
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
EACH OTHER

08:24.068 --> 08:25.592
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.811
YEAH, BUT I MEAN, YOU'VE
OBVIOUSLY KEPT IN TOUCH.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.292
WELL, SHE WRITES ME
THESE LETTERS, AND...

08:30.292 --> 08:31.728
WHY? I MEAN,

08:31.728 --> 08:33.295
DID YOU GUYS DATE
OR SOMETHING?

08:33.295 --> 08:35.732
DATE? NO.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.212
I MEAN, MAYBE,
YOU KNOW,

08:37.212 --> 08:38.213
SHE KISSED ME ONCE.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.388
KISSED YOU?

08:39.388 --> 08:40.389
NO, IT'S
NOT LIKE THAT.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.433
I MEAN MAYBE
SHE WAS JUST

08:41.433 --> 08:42.565
A LITTLE BIT
IN LOVE WITH ME--

08:42.565 --> 08:43.958
IN LOVE WITH YOU?!

08:43.958 --> 08:45.742
SEE...NO.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.527
BUT IT WAS EONS AGO.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.789
NOTHING ELSE
EVER HAPPENED.

08:48.789 --> 08:49.790
RIGHT, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW,

08:49.790 --> 08:52.140
SHE'S TOO BUSY
BEING A MODEL.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.794
CLAUDIA,

08:53.794 --> 08:55.447
OH, MAN, MAN,

08:55.447 --> 08:56.710
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.321
NO, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SAID MORE.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.627
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID
EVERYTHING.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.628
I MEAN, 'CAUSE NOW
I FEEL LIKE

09:01.628 --> 09:04.413
YOU HID THIS FROM ME
FOR A REASON.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.806
WHAT?

09:05.806 --> 09:09.244
NO, I DIDN'T MEAN...

09:09.244 --> 09:12.464
OK.

09:12.464 --> 09:15.380
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST, UH, JUST FORGET IT.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.994
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

09:19.994 --> 09:21.865
NO.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.475
NO.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.744
SO, THE ANSWER'S NO.

09:30.744 --> 09:31.919
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO COLLEGE.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.269
JUST A FLAT-OUT,
ARBITRARY NO.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.575
IT'S NOT ARBITRARY.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.315
IT'S BASED ON YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.796
YEARS THAT SEEMED
LIKE DECADES.

09:39.796 --> 09:43.191
YOU KNOW, SCHOOL ISN'T
THAT BORING, BAILEY.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.586
LATISSIMUS DORSI.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.196
OH, GOD.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.414
THIS LATIN.
I'VE GOT TO STOP

09:49.414 --> 09:51.242
TRANSPOSING THE Is
AND THE Us.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.331
SEE? EVEN YOU CAN'T
GET INTO THIS STUFF.

09:53.331 --> 09:56.073
NO. I ACTUALLY
LOVE THIS STUFF.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.466
OK, FOR INSTANCE,
DID YOU KNOW

09:57.466 --> 09:59.686
THE LIVER CAN FILTER
OVER 2,000 POUNDS

09:59.686 --> 10:01.165
OF MINERALS EVERY YEAR?
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T TELL ME

10:01.165 --> 10:02.297
THAT'S NOT EXCITING.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.081
FOR YOU.
YOU'RE PREMED.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.040
WELL, YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO FIND YOUR "PRE."

10:06.040 --> 10:09.043
OH, THAT'S IT?
JUST FIND MY "PRE?"

10:09.043 --> 10:10.261
WHY DIDN'T
I THINK OF THAT?

10:10.261 --> 10:11.262
I JUST MEANT
WHAT BETTER PLACE

10:11.262 --> 10:12.263
TO FIGURE STUFF OUT?

10:12.263 --> 10:13.308
I MEAN, COLLEGE
HAS COURSES

10:13.308 --> 10:15.397
ON EVERY
CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.747
WHAT BETTER PLACE?

10:17.747 --> 10:19.488
HOW ABOUT
THE REAL WORLD?

10:19.488 --> 10:21.316
THAT'S WHAT
INTERESTS ME.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.144
SO FOR YOU ANY SUBJECT

10:23.144 --> 10:24.580
IS AUTOMATICALLY
LESS INTERESTING

10:24.580 --> 10:26.277
IF IT'S EXPERIENCED
IN A BOOK.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.279
YUP. PRETTY MUCH.

10:28.279 --> 10:29.759
I GUESS THAT MAKES US
PRETTY DIFFERENT, THEN,

10:29.759 --> 10:31.761
BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK

10:31.761 --> 10:33.415
OF ANY ASPECT
OF WHAT I'M STUDYING

10:33.415 --> 10:35.809
THAT I WOULDN'T CHOOSE
TO READ MORE ABOUT.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.419
OH, YEAH?

10:37.419 --> 10:38.768
THANK YOU.

10:44.165 --> 10:47.342
THE, UM, EXTERNAL...

10:47.342 --> 10:48.343
OBLIQUES?

10:48.343 --> 10:51.302
YOU WANNA LOOK UP
THE SPELLING?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.174
MAYBE CHECK
THE CLASSIFICATION?

10:53.174 --> 10:55.829
THAT'S NOT A FAIR
ARGUMENT, BAILEY.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.178
COME HERE.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.354
I DON'T KNOW, KIRSTEN,

10:59.354 --> 11:00.964
I DON'T KNOW IF I
COULD WORK THAT WAY.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.792
SOMEONE OVER MY SHOULDER
EVERY SECOND,

11:02.792 --> 11:04.272
TELLING ME HOW
TO DO MY JOB.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.708
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

11:05.708 --> 11:07.884
LOOK, I TOOK A LOOK
AT THEIR CATALOGS,

11:07.884 --> 11:10.670
AND, I MEAN,
THEY PUSH THIS WHOLE

11:10.670 --> 11:12.062
CUTTING-EDGE
IMAGE THING,

11:12.062 --> 11:13.585
BUT REALLY THEY'RE ALL
ABOUT MARKET SHARE,

11:13.585 --> 11:15.283
JUST LIKE
ANY BIG COMPANY.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.937
WHICH MEANS, YOU KNOW,

11:16.937 --> 11:19.635
MAKING A PRODUCT
THAT EVERYBODY LIKES.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.897
WHICH MEANS SOONER
OR LATER

11:20.897 --> 11:23.073
ME HAVING TO MAKE
STUFF THAT I HATE.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.075
OK, THEN DON'T TAKE IT.

11:25.075 --> 11:28.688
JUST LEAVE AND FIND
SOMEPLACE ELSE TO WORK.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.211
I WOULD...

11:30.211 --> 11:33.301
EXCEPT ALL MY DESIGNS
BELONG TO GUS.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.563
EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN DRAWING

11:34.563 --> 11:36.608
FOR THE LAST
6 MONTHS.

11:36.608 --> 11:37.914
I WANT TO BUILD THAT
STUFF, KIRSTEN,

11:37.914 --> 11:40.482
I CAN'T--I CAN'T
JUST WALK AWAY.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.487
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BUY
THE COMPANY AND NOT THEM.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.186
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

11:49.186 --> 11:51.841
WHAT?!

11:51.841 --> 11:53.800
THAT WAS A JOKE.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.759
I KNOW, BUT, I MEAN,

11:56.759 --> 11:58.456
WHY NOT?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.720
THEY'RE ASKING ME TO RUN
THE COMPANY FOR THEM,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.809
WHY NOT RUN IT FOR MYSELF?

12:02.809 --> 12:05.289
CHARLIE,

12:05.289 --> 12:07.117
HOW MUCH
WOULD THAT COST?

12:07.117 --> 12:09.380
A LOT.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.468
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

12:10.468 --> 12:12.601
BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
THEY HAVE BANKS.

12:12.601 --> 12:15.082
IT'S JUST...

12:15.082 --> 12:16.648
I MEAN IT'S HUGE.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.215
I KNOW.

12:18.215 --> 12:21.958
I MEAN IT'S LIKE
MILLIONS HUGE.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.134
I MEAN, I KNOW--

12:24.134 --> 12:26.397
I'M SURE THAT YOU
COULD DO IT, BUT...

12:26.397 --> 12:28.660
BUT, CHARLIE,

12:28.660 --> 12:30.880
THAT'S HUGE.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.452
HEY.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.193
HEY, YOU.

12:40.934 --> 12:41.935
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:41.935 --> 12:43.588
SPRING CLEANING.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.939
OUT WITH THE OLD...

12:45.939 --> 12:47.636
IN WITH THE NEW.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.290
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.595
YEAH.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.121
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.515
WHAT, NO "HELLO.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY"?

12:57.515 --> 12:58.821
I KNOW HOW YOUR DAY WAS.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.170
I SPENT IT WITH YOU.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.171
MMM, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.130
YOU DID.
YOU WERE THERE.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.349
SO YOU COULDN'T
HAVE MISSED IT.

13:05.349 --> 13:08.352
MISSED WHAT?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.485
ADAM, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOU TODAY

13:10.485 --> 13:12.617
IN WALKER'S CLASS?

13:12.617 --> 13:15.446
I MEAN, IT WAS SWEET IF
YOU WERE DEFENDING ME,

13:15.446 --> 13:16.796
BUT I COULDN'T TELL.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.754
AND I KNOW HE'S BEEN
GIVING YOU

13:18.754 --> 13:19.799
A HARD TIME
ABOUT SPELLING--

13:19.799 --> 13:22.584
THAT LITTLE
DISCUSSION WE HAD?

13:22.584 --> 13:24.194
IT WASN'T JUST
A LITTLE DISCUSSION.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.892
YOU WERE REALLY
GETTING ON HIS CASE.

13:25.892 --> 13:30.766
WELL, HE SHOULD HEAR
STUFF LIKE THAT MORE OFTEN.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.768
MM-MMM.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.943
HE'S A PROFESSOR.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

13:33.943 --> 13:36.250
HEARING STUFF LIKE
THAT FROM HIM.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.471
JULIA, PLEASE.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.691
DON'T SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.215
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DON'T MAKE SENSE?

13:45.215 --> 13:46.695
UH, YEAH.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.827
EXACTLY.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.132
WHY NOT?

13:49.132 --> 13:51.221
'CAUSE IT'S DEPRESSING
WATCHING MY GIRLFRIEND

13:51.221 --> 13:52.527
TURN INTO A DRONE.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.398
A DRONE?

13:54.398 --> 13:55.399
HOW AM I A DRONE?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.706
YOU ARE TAKING
THEIR CRAP

13:57.706 --> 13:59.229
AS THE GOSPEL.

13:59.229 --> 14:00.230
WHY?

14:00.230 --> 14:02.929
WHY, 'CAUSE
THEY HAVE TENURE?

14:02.929 --> 14:04.713
I MEAN, WH-WH-WHAT
DOES THAT PROVE?

14:04.713 --> 14:07.063
I MEAN, HOW DOES THAT
QUALIFY THEM TO JUDGE YOU?

14:07.063 --> 14:08.195
HUH?

14:08.195 --> 14:10.327
ADAM, IT'S CALLED
SCHOOL.

14:10.327 --> 14:12.503
I PAY THEM THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS TO JUDGE ME.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.679
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHY I'M THERE.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.553
REALLY?

14:20.947 --> 14:21.948
YOU MEAN THAT?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.167
WELL, YEAH.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.058
HEY.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.189
HEY.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.715
YOU KNOW,
I WAS JUST THINKING

14:50.715 --> 14:52.587
THAT YOU SPEND ALL
THIS TIME IN OUR HOUSE,

14:52.587 --> 14:55.546
AND YOU PRACTICALLY
KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT US,

14:55.546 --> 14:59.028
BUT WE'RE KIND
OF CLUELESS ABOUT YOU.

14:59.028 --> 15:01.552
I MEAN, YOU LIKE
TO SALSA.

15:01.552 --> 15:03.946
YOU PUT CHOCOLATE
IN YOUR CHILI,

15:03.946 --> 15:06.079
BUT THAT'S KIND OF IT.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.211
YOU KNOW? I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU GREW UP.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.909
I DON'T KNOW YOUR
FAMILY.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.041
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
MOVED FROM SOMEWHERE.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.304
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT
YOU, CLAUDIA,

15:14.304 --> 15:16.002
BUT THERE REALLY
ISN'T MUCH TO TELL.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.403
OK, SO, I'LL ADMIT,

15:26.403 --> 15:27.927
YESTERDAY WITH OWEN

15:27.927 --> 15:30.407
KIND OF MADE ME
A LITTLE CURIOUS.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.062
IT SEEMED LIKE
THERE WAS SOMETHING

15:33.062 --> 15:34.846
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO SAY.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.457
BUT YOU DECIDED
TO ASK ME ANYWAY?

15:36.457 --> 15:39.155
NO, I JUST--

15:39.155 --> 15:40.940
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS
BECAUSE OWEN WAS THERE.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.071
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING

15:42.071 --> 15:43.768
YOU THOUGHT
HE WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:43.768 --> 15:47.903
MAYBE IT'S JUST
PERSONAL.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.470
OK?

15:49.470 --> 15:51.341
RIGHT.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.603
RIGHT, OK.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.736
I'M NOT GONNA PUSH.
IT'S JUST--

15:54.736 --> 15:57.304
IF YOU EVER DO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING,

15:57.304 --> 15:58.305
I MEAN,

15:58.305 --> 15:59.480
VICTOR, YOU'RE OUR FRIEND.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.569
YOU KNOW? JUST BECAUSE
YOU DON'T THINK

16:01.569 --> 16:02.918
IT'S IN YOUR
JOB DESCRIPTION
DOESN'T MEAN THAT--

16:02.918 --> 16:06.095
I JUST SAID
IT WAS PERSONAL.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.489
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
SAY THAT?

16:13.450 --> 16:14.712
I DON'T WANT
TO PITCH THIS

16:14.712 --> 16:16.410
LIKE IT'S SOME BIG
LONG SHOT, YOU KNOW?

16:16.410 --> 16:17.802
I WANT TO PITCH IT
LIKE IT'S A LAY-UP.

16:17.802 --> 16:19.065
I MEAN, OUR NEXT
COUPLE LINES COME OUT,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.109
HIT THE MARKET,

16:20.109 --> 16:21.415
WE MAKE A BALLOON PAYMENT,

16:21.415 --> 16:23.199
AND BANG! THE BANK'S
BACK IN THE BLACK

16:23.199 --> 16:25.593
IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.116
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.813
BAILEY, THE NUMBERS
ARE GOOD.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.250
IF ANYTHING,
I'M BEING CONSERVATIVE.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.468
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE NOT.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.774
IT'S JUST...

16:32.774 --> 16:34.471
WHAT?

16:34.471 --> 16:36.734
IT'S SO HUGE.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.388
YEAH. SO I HEAR.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.043
NOT THAT I'M SAYING
THAT YOU CAN'T
DO IT, AT ALL.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.479
BAILEY, YOU KNOW
HOW IT IS.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.437
EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.091
IT'S JUST AN EXTRA
ZERO OR TWO.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.657
BUT IT'S MORE ZEROES
THAN ANYTHING

16:46.657 --> 16:47.832
I'VE EVER COME NEAR.

16:47.832 --> 16:48.964
THIS IS MORE ZEROES

16:48.964 --> 16:51.662
THAN ALL THE EXPANSIONS

16:51.662 --> 16:52.750
AT SALINGER'S
PUT TOGETHER.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.405
ARE YOU SAYING
I'M MAKING A MISTAKE HERE?

16:57.712 --> 17:00.497
NO, I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.717
IT'S JUST...

17:02.717 --> 17:04.675
IT'S SO...

17:04.675 --> 17:06.373
HUGE.
HUGE.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.201
THANKS, THAT, UH,

17:08.201 --> 17:10.072
REALLY TAKES
ALL THE PRESSURE OFF.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.179
SO WHY DO YOU NEED
ALL THESE BOOKS AGAIN?

18:13.179 --> 18:15.964
WELL, I'VE GOT 2 LABS
AND A PAPER DUE,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.748
AND YOU'RE CARRYING
MY BIBLIOGRAPHY.

18:17.748 --> 18:21.970
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
HAVE ROOM IN YOUR HEAD
FOR ALL THIS.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.363
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.973
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.540
OK, SEE YOU LATER.
BYE.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.019
BAILEY,

18:28.019 --> 18:29.804
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO TRY IT?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.936
JUST ONE LITTLE LECTURE?

18:31.936 --> 18:33.068
HOLLY,

18:33.068 --> 18:35.157
YOU DON'T WANT ME
IN THERE.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.638
OK, I SNORE AT LECTURES.
REALLY LOUD.

18:37.638 --> 18:40.684
BUT IT'S REPRODUCTIVE
BIOLOGY, AND IF THAT
DOESN'T--

18:40.684 --> 18:42.033
HOLLY, DROP IT.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.513
LOOK, IT;S JUST...

18:43.513 --> 18:45.994
SCHOOL.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.475
IT'S THESE PEOPLE
AND THESE CLASSROOMS,

18:48.475 --> 18:50.390
I JUST DON'T
FIT IN HERE.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.218
WHY NOT?

18:54.568 --> 18:56.135
THEY MAKE ME
FEEL STUPID.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.527
WHAT?!

18:59.834 --> 19:01.575
I'M NOT A GREAT READER.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.011
I'M NOT A GREAT WRITER.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.448
AND EVERYBODY ELSE HERE,
THEY'RE LIKE YOU.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.667
THEY CAN DO THIS.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.798
SO...

19:07.798 --> 19:09.974
OK, LISTEN--
NO.

19:09.974 --> 19:12.890
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA WORK.

19:12.890 --> 19:14.936
SO, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.503
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

19:16.503 --> 19:17.678
OK.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.203
Walker:
I WANT TO START TODAY

19:21.203 --> 19:23.031
BY TALKING ABOUT
SUBTEXT.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.641
NOW, THERE'S
A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT

19:24.641 --> 19:26.077
THAT HOLDS
THAT THE BEST WRITER

19:26.077 --> 19:27.209
NEVER LET'S
HIS CHARACTER SAY

19:27.209 --> 19:28.254
WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY
THINKING.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.429
EXCUSE ME, WALKER?

19:29.429 --> 19:31.474
WHAT'S THIS NOTE MEAN?

19:31.474 --> 19:33.824
UH, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THAT AFTER CLASS.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.043
NO, WHERE IT SAYS

19:35.043 --> 19:39.265
"BREVITY, SHARPNESS.
WE NEED A POINT"?

19:39.265 --> 19:40.831
I'M JUST CURIOUS,
YOU KNOW.

19:40.831 --> 19:41.832
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.138
[WHISPERING]
Adam, don't be an idiot.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.967
COULD YOU EXPLAIN
WHY YOU SAY THAT?

19:45.967 --> 19:48.099
ALL RIGHT, UM,

19:48.099 --> 19:49.231
IN A NUTSHELL,

19:49.231 --> 19:51.407
THE LANGUAGE DID NOT
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME,

19:51.407 --> 19:52.669
AND I FELT
THAT IT TOOK ME

19:52.669 --> 19:53.714
LONGER TO READ
THE STORY,

19:53.714 --> 19:55.150
THAN IT PROBABLY
TOOK YOU TO WRITE IT.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.022
BUT WHAT IF THERE'S
NOTHING SPECIFIC

19:58.022 --> 19:59.067
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.808
YOU KNOW? WHAT IF
I WANTED THE READER

20:00.808 --> 20:02.723
TO LOSE HIMSELF
IN THE LANGUAGE?

20:02.723 --> 20:04.115
WELL, OK, ADAM.
BUT YOU KNOW,

20:04.115 --> 20:05.943
IF YOU JUST THROW WORDS
DOWN ON A PAGE,

20:05.943 --> 20:07.597
AND THEY DON'T ADD UP
TO ANYTHING,

20:07.597 --> 20:09.469
THEN YOU'RE DOING
THE READER A DISSERVICE.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.427
AND YOURSELF.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.516
YOU'RE, UH, PRETTY
SURE ABOUT THAT, HUH?

20:13.516 --> 20:16.432
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU'RE
JUST WASTING MY TIME.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.395
BECKETT'S LANGUAGE
IN THE LOST ONES

20:22.395 --> 20:24.048
IS EXTREMELY PLAYFUL,

20:24.048 --> 20:26.399
YET STILL ERUDITE.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.923
THE AUTHOR DEALS
BRILLIANTLY

20:28.923 --> 20:30.577
WITH ISSUES
OF ISOLATION AND DOUBT

20:30.577 --> 20:32.231
BY LETTING
THE READER DRIFT

20:32.231 --> 20:35.495
WITH HIS OWN
AMBIVALENCE.

20:35.495 --> 20:38.324
SLEEPING GIANT
REVIEW,

20:38.324 --> 20:39.673
1954.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.458
WHAT?

20:42.458 --> 20:44.547
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
SAMUEL BECKETT?

20:44.547 --> 20:46.419
HE DIDN'T WRITE
JUST PLAYS, YOU KNOW.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.725
THERE WAS ALSO
SHORT STORIES
AND OTHER STUFF.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.770
YOU KNOW, BUT THEY
WERE EASY TO MISS.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.425
THERE WERE ONLY LIKE
19 COPIES PRINTED.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.165
THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUNNY?

20:54.165 --> 20:55.645
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE A POINT.

20:55.645 --> 20:56.907
WELL, IT'S GOOD WORK.

20:56.907 --> 20:57.908
PUTTING ALL YOUR ENERGY

20:57.908 --> 20:59.519
INTO A BIG, RAISED
FINGER.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.129
YOU TRYING TO SAY

21:01.129 --> 21:02.609
I SHOULDN'T BE
TEACHING THIS CLASS?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.132
NAH, I JUST...

21:06.047 --> 21:08.179
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE NOBODY SHOULD.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.238
YEAH, THE COMPANY'S
HAD SOME GROWING TO DO,

21:23.238 --> 21:25.588
AND IT'S BEEN
A LOT OF WORK.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.374
WHEN I COMPUTERIZED
THE BILLING SYSTEM,

21:28.374 --> 21:30.506
IT WAS LIKE I INVENTED
FIRE OR SOMETHING.

21:30.506 --> 21:33.422
CHARLIE, THERE IS NO ONE
I'D RATHER SEE RUN
THIS COMPANY THAN YOU.

21:33.422 --> 21:36.904
WE WERE ABOUT
TO FORECLOSE
UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.079
SO?

21:38.079 --> 21:40.168
SO, THEIR OFFER,

21:40.168 --> 21:42.344
THIS FIGURE
WE HAVE TO BEAT--

21:42.344 --> 21:44.825
PLEASE...DON'T SAY
IT'S HUGE.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.567
NO. IT'S THE PREMIUM
THEY'RE PUTTING ON IT.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.700
IT'S TOO MUCH FOR
THE COMPANY'S ASSETS
TO FULLY COLLATERALIZE.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.747
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE BANKING ON ALL
MY OUTSTANDING ORDERS.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.444
WHICH MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.098
I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE
PAYING TOO MUCH MONEY.

21:57.098 --> 22:01.320
SO IF IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM,
THEN WHY NOT FOR US?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.104
THEY'RE NOT COMING TO ME
FOR THE MONEY.

22:03.104 --> 22:07.064
IF THEY WERE, I'D
WANT EXTRA COLLATERAL
FROM THEM, SAME AS YOU.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.892
COLLATERAL?

22:08.892 --> 22:11.112
MARK...

22:11.112 --> 22:13.767
ON A LOAN THIS BIG,
I DON'T HAVE MONEY LIKE THAT.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.465
I'VE GOT CREDIT CARDS
I CAN'T PAY DOWN YET.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.123
CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING
CREATIVE HERE?

22:22.123 --> 22:24.386
I MEAN,
THIS DEAL IS GOOD, MARK.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.606
YOU KNOW ME.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.390
SEE, WE'RE A BANK,
CHARLIE.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.871
FIDUCIARY OFFICERS,
LOAN COMMITTEES.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.352
CREATIVITY'S NOT
REALLY OUR THING.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.182
I'M SORRY.

22:59.552 --> 23:03.382
PEELING BACK
THE EXTERNAL OBLIQUE
SHOWS THE IRREGULAR PATTERN.

23:03.382 --> 23:08.125
THE TENDINOUS INSCRIPTION
WEAVES ACROSS
THE RECTUS ABDOMINI

23:08.125 --> 23:13.479
LATERALLY, DIAGONALLY,
AND THEN VERTICALLY.

23:13.479 --> 23:17.178
NOW I SUGGEST YOU PAY CAREFUL
ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING
SECTION.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.745
I GUARANTEE...

23:18.745 --> 23:20.703
Man: SO, YOUR COMPANY'S
IN THE BLACK.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.836
YOU'VE HAD REVENUES
POURING IN,

23:22.836 --> 23:24.490
YOUR R&amp;D IS PAID FOR,

23:24.490 --> 23:27.580
YOU'RE ALREADY TOOLED UP
WITH CASH ON ACCOUNT,

23:27.580 --> 23:28.972
WHICH IS GROWING
AND GROWING.

23:28.972 --> 23:29.973
IT'S MONEY
IN THE BANK, RIGHT?

23:29.973 --> 23:32.280
HOW CAN THAT BE
A BAD THING?

23:32.280 --> 23:34.325
YOUR BALANCE SHEET
STRENGTHENS.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.240
YOUR DEBT EQUITY RATIOS
RIGHT THEMSELVES.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.591
WHAT COULD BE WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE?

23:38.591 --> 23:42.072
IT'S CALLED
THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.813
NOW, WHO COULD HELP ME
WITH THIS?

23:43.813 --> 23:46.512
IS THIS THE INTEREST
THAT YOU'RE EARNING

23:46.512 --> 23:49.819
OR THE INTEREST
THAT YOU'RE PAYING?

23:49.819 --> 23:53.040
NEITHER.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.302
YES.

23:54.302 --> 23:56.565
UH...NEITHER?

23:56.565 --> 23:57.566
CORRECT.

23:57.566 --> 23:58.654
VERY GOOD.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.874
IT'S THE VALUE
THAT YOU COULD BE ADDING

24:00.874 --> 24:02.832
BY INVESTING IT ELSEWHERE,

24:02.832 --> 24:05.618
AN OPPORTUNITY
YOU MIGHT BE MISSING.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.925
THERE'S A MARKET
FOR YOUR MONEY,

24:08.925 --> 24:10.710
AND YOU WANT THE BEST VALUE

24:10.710 --> 24:12.973
WHEN YOU'RE GOING
TO SELL IT TO SOMEONE.

24:12.973 --> 24:16.759
NOW, WHAT IS
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY
TO DETERMINE THAT VALUE?

24:16.759 --> 24:19.588
IS IT THE EQUITIES MARKET?

24:19.588 --> 24:22.025
IS IT A LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP?

24:22.025 --> 24:24.245
IS IT STARTING
A FRUIT STAND?

24:24.245 --> 24:26.203
COME ON, HELP ME HERE.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.340
EQUITIES.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.341
YES.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.342
EQUITIES.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.517
WRONG.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.477
THE EQUITIES MARKET
SEEKS APT VALUATIONS,

24:38.477 --> 24:41.001
BUT ITS LIMITS TO KNOWLEDGE
ARE FAR TOO GREAT.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.045
LET ME JUST ADD THIS.

24:42.045 --> 24:44.091
THIS KIND OF THINKING,
THIS, UM...

24:44.091 --> 24:46.702
THIS STREET-SMART
DAY TRADING,

24:46.702 --> 24:49.226
BLIND FAITH
IN THE MARKETS

24:49.226 --> 24:53.622
IS ANATHEMA
TO TRUE WEALTH CREATION.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.145
SO I KEEP WATCHING,

24:55.145 --> 24:59.454
AND SHE SLIPS HIM
THIS PACKAGE OF WHATEVER
AND JUST WALKS AWAY.

24:59.454 --> 25:00.803
I DON'T KNOW, TODD.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.458
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DON'T TRUST HIM.
IT'S JUST...

25:03.458 --> 25:04.546
Girl: HELLO?

25:04.546 --> 25:07.810
OH, SORRY, TODD.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE ON.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.203
TODD, WHO WAS THAT?

25:09.203 --> 25:10.726
IT'S NO ONE.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.598
THAT WASN'T NO ONE.

25:12.598 --> 25:16.166
WELL, IT'S SOMEONE.
UH...

25:16.166 --> 25:17.516
IT'S JUST,
SHE'S NOT...

25:17.516 --> 25:19.256
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
ANYTHING BAD.

25:19.256 --> 25:22.433
TODD, WHAT DID I SAY
BEFORE ABOUT...

25:22.433 --> 25:26.089
I MEAN, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS,
ABOUT NOT WITHHOLDING.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.090
UM...

25:27.090 --> 25:30.006
OK, LOOK...

25:30.006 --> 25:32.966
ME AND MABEL...

25:32.966 --> 25:36.186
WE WERE LEAVING
THIS CLUB
IN THE VILLAGE.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.711
SHE JUST WANTED
TO WALK HOME,
BUT IT STARTED TO RAIN,

25:38.711 --> 25:42.062
AND HER BODY SUIT
SOAKED THROUGH,

25:42.062 --> 25:44.238
AND THE ONLY REASON
THAT SHE CAME UP
TO MY ROOM

25:44.238 --> 25:46.240
WAS TO TAKE A HOT BATH.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.981
PLUS,
SHE LOST HER PURSE,

25:47.981 --> 25:51.941
SO THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON THAT SHE'S
SPENDING THE NIGHT.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.772
UH...CLAUDIA?

25:56.772 --> 25:59.166
ARE YOU THERE?

25:59.166 --> 26:00.297
UM...

26:00.297 --> 26:02.648
[CLICK]

26:06.521 --> 26:08.044
HEY, MAN, CHECK IT OUT.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.351
I TALKED TO A COUPLE
OF V.C. GUYS I KNOW.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.482
V.C.?

26:11.482 --> 26:13.049
VENTURE CAPITAL.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.051
AND THIS WHOLE THING'S
NOT REALLY THEIR BAG.

26:15.051 --> 26:16.792
EVERYBODY OWNS
A DOT-COM THESE DAYS.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.141
BUT I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

26:18.141 --> 26:20.317
THEY TOLD ME
IF YOU COULD SCRAPE UP

26:20.317 --> 26:22.581
THE LITTLEST BIT
OF COLLATERAL--
BAILEY...

26:22.581 --> 26:23.930
AND I GOT TO THINKING.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.453
COLLATERAL.
WE GOT STUFF, MAN.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.021
WE GOT THE HOUSE,
WE GOT THE RESTAURANT,
WE HAVE CARS.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.152
NO WAY.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.198
WE CAN STILL
MAKE THIS DEAL.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.503
CHARLIE, DON'T
GIVE UP ON IT.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.767
I'M NOT GIVING UP.
I'M JUST...

26:34.767 --> 26:36.203
I'M JUST
CHANGING MY MIND.

26:36.203 --> 26:40.294
CHANGING YOUR MIND?
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG?

26:40.294 --> 26:44.733
LOOK, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
EVERY WAY THAT I COULD
SWING THIS DEAL, OK,

26:44.733 --> 26:48.345
AND I REALIZED THAT
I'M ASKING A LOT OF PEOPLE
TO TAKE BIG RISKS HERE--

26:48.345 --> 26:51.000
THE MONEY PEOPLE,
THE WORKERS, KIRSTEN,
EVEN YOU GUYS.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.915
AND WHY? SO THAT I
CAN BE IN CHARGE?

26:52.915 --> 26:55.483
SO THAT I CAN BE ASSURED
OF BUILDING THE DESIGNS
THAT I WANT TO BUILD?

26:55.483 --> 26:58.181
NO, BECAUSE THIS COMPANY
NEEDS YOU, CHARLIE.

26:58.181 --> 26:59.618
YOU HAVE AMAZING PLANS
FOR THIS PLACE.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.271
AND I'LL PROBABLY
STILL BE ABLE TO DO
ALL THAT STUFF

27:01.271 --> 27:02.751
IF I TAKE THE JOB
THAT THEY'RE OFFERING.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.100
I'LL GET PAID VERY WELL.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.059
I'LL GET TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH KIRSTEN.

27:06.059 --> 27:10.280
CHARLIE, YOU HAVE WORKED
SO HARD FOR THIS, MAN,
AND IT'S RIGHT.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.195
IT IS SO RIGHT FOR YOU.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.849
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.374
MAYBE SO...

27:17.374 --> 27:19.202
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT,

27:19.202 --> 27:21.640
THERE'S OTHER STUFF
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THAT.

27:29.735 --> 27:30.779
WHAT?

27:30.779 --> 27:32.433
YOU THINK YOU CAN HIDE?

27:32.433 --> 27:36.524
VAL, I WILL COME DOWN THERE
IF I HAVE TO.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.178
LOOK, JUST...

27:38.178 --> 27:39.658
I WILL CALL YOU LATER.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.668
IS EVERYTHING OK?

27:50.930 --> 27:53.280
YES. WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

27:53.280 --> 27:56.283
OK, LOOK, I KNOW
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.632
NOTHING'S WRONG, CLAUDIA.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.895
VICTOR, I SAW YOU.

27:59.895 --> 28:02.506
TODAY I GOT OFF THE BUS,
AND I SAW YOU.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.117
SAW ME WHAT?

28:04.117 --> 28:06.597
YOU'RE LIKE THE QUEEN
OF NONSEQUITURS LATELY.

28:06.597 --> 28:09.209
YOU WERE FIGHTING WITH
SOME WOMAN IN THE STREET.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.951
YOU HANDED HER SOME MONEY,
AND SHE GAVE YOU SOMETHING.

28:11.951 --> 28:15.998
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING YOU
WERE DOING ANYTHING WRONG,

28:15.998 --> 28:17.913
BUT I WISH YOU'D TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

28:17.913 --> 28:21.656
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SAW, HMM?

28:21.656 --> 28:22.918
A LITTLE STREET ACTION?

28:22.918 --> 28:26.008
SOME CRACK WHORE SELLING
THE PUERTO RICAN GUY
DRUGS?

28:26.008 --> 28:28.445
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.621
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.188
VICTOR, YOU TAKE CARE
OF MY BROTHER.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.017
I HAVE GIVEN YOU
NO REASON EVER
TO DOUBT ME.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.019
YOU'RE MAKING IT WORSE
BY NOT ANSWERING ME,
VICTOR.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.455
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO INTERROGATE ME.

28:38.455 --> 28:39.892
AND IF THAT'S NOT OK,

28:39.892 --> 28:42.242
IF HAVING NO PRIVACY
IS A CONDITION
OF MY EMPLOYMENT,

28:42.242 --> 28:43.417
THEN YOU LET ME KNOW

28:43.417 --> 28:47.726
'CAUSE MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BE WORKING HERE ANYMORE!

29:01.435 --> 29:02.741
WHAT?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.394
WHY ARE YOU SO QUIET?

29:04.394 --> 29:06.657
WHAT'S GOING ON, ADAM?

29:06.657 --> 29:07.876
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

29:07.876 --> 29:09.660
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

29:12.794 --> 29:15.057
ONE MINUTE
YOU'RE PICKING FIGHTS
WITH PROFESSORS,

29:15.057 --> 29:17.016
THE NEXT, YOU'RE SWEET
AND ROMANTIC.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.495
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

29:18.495 --> 29:21.542
NOTHING IS WRONG WITH ME,
JULIA.

29:21.542 --> 29:26.112
ADAM, THAT SCHOOL IS
ABOUT TO SUSPEND YOU
OR WORSE.

29:26.112 --> 29:29.463
HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
SIPPING YOUR COFFEE LIKE
NOTHING HAS HAPPENED?

29:29.463 --> 29:30.507
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?

29:30.507 --> 29:31.465
DON'T YOU CARE THAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE

29:31.465 --> 29:32.466
KICKED OUT OF COLLEGE?

29:32.466 --> 29:33.772
I DON'T KNOW.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.338
MAYBE NOT.

29:35.338 --> 29:38.689
MAYBE I DON'T BELONG
IN THIS PLACE.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.649
I DON'T GET YOU
RIGHT NOW.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.347
I DON'T GET YOU.

29:44.347 --> 29:47.263
NO, I AM NOT LETTING YOU
DO THAT AGAIN.

29:47.263 --> 29:48.961
YOU MIGHT THINK I'M
A LEMMING OR SOMETHING

29:48.961 --> 29:52.094
FOR LISTENING TO
TEACHERS WHO HAVE YEARS
MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ME,

29:52.094 --> 29:54.618
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
AT LEAST I'M COMMITTING
MYSELF TO SOMETHING.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.577
LIKE YOUR BOOK?
WHAT?

29:56.577 --> 29:57.839
YOUR BOOK ABOUT NED

29:57.839 --> 30:00.450
THAT YOU WERE SO SCARED
TO LET OUT OF YOUR HANDS

30:00.450 --> 30:03.018
BECAUSE 2 LOUSY PEOPLE
REJECTED IT.

30:03.018 --> 30:03.976
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.673
YOU TOLD ME YOURSELF,
JULIA.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.458
YOU SAID YOU REREAD IT
AND COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.547
MAYBE NOTHING WAS WRONG.

30:10.547 --> 30:14.987
LOOK, YOU HAVE
ALL THIS TALENT.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.642
YOU SLINK AROUND BEGGING
FOR SCRAPS OF APPROVAL.

30:18.642 --> 30:21.602
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
YOUR WRITING IS NOT GOOD

30:21.602 --> 30:24.779
UNTIL SOMEONE ELSE
SAYS SO.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.478
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:28.478 --> 30:32.831
MAYBE I COULD STAND
TO COMMIT TO SOME THINGS.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.008
BUT AT LEAST
I COMMIT TO MYSELF.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.029
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:57.029 --> 30:58.857
UH, NOTHING.
I'M JUST...

30:58.857 --> 31:00.032
JUST READING.

31:00.032 --> 31:03.165
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.167
READING WHAT?

31:10.564 --> 31:13.175
MY FRESHMAN ECON TEXT?

31:13.175 --> 31:16.048
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
READING THAT FOR?

31:16.048 --> 31:18.050
WHAT?

31:18.050 --> 31:20.879
JUST A COUPLE HOURS.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.363
ON THE THEORIES
OF MICROECONOMICS?

31:27.363 --> 31:31.411
THIS PROFESSOR
SAID SOMETHING TODAY
THAT'S GOT ME THINKING.

31:31.411 --> 31:32.412
WHAT PROFESSOR?

31:32.412 --> 31:35.284
IT SOUNDED WRONG TO ME,
WHAT HE SAID.

31:35.284 --> 31:38.679
BUT I LOOKED IT UP
IN THIS BOOK,
AND HE WASRIGHT,

31:38.679 --> 31:40.028
ACCORDING TO THIS.

31:40.028 --> 31:42.596
SO I JUST FIGURED
I'D KEEP ON READING,
YOU KNOW,

31:42.596 --> 31:46.034
AND SEE WHAT I THOUGHT
OF THE REST OF IT.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.775
AND IT'S GOOD.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.559
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

31:49.559 --> 31:54.129
SOME OF IT'S JUST WEIRD,
SPACEY THEORY

31:54.129 --> 31:57.654
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BUSINESS, BUT...

31:58.960 --> 32:00.092
BAILEY...

32:02.311 --> 32:04.357
YEAH, I KNOW.

32:04.357 --> 32:08.491
2 YEARS AGO,
YOU COULDN'T HAVE PAID ME
TO SLOG THROUGH THIS THING.

32:08.491 --> 32:11.103
BUT NOW YOU'VE BEEN
OUT IN THE WORLD.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.931
YES.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.845
RIGHT.

32:14.845 --> 32:17.631
SO IT'S NOT JUST IDEAS NOW,
YOU KNOW.

32:17.631 --> 32:21.069
THERE'S STUFF THAT I'VE DONE
THAT MAKES THIS REAL.

32:21.069 --> 32:24.203
SO, UM...
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

32:24.203 --> 32:29.121
DOES IT CHANGE HOW YOU
FEEL ABOUT COLLEGE?

32:32.472 --> 32:34.387
I GUESS MAYBE...

32:37.129 --> 32:39.740
I COULD GIVE IT A TRY.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.311
MAYBE.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.668
HEY.
HEY.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.191
HI.
HEY.

32:56.191 --> 32:57.714
CLAUD, HI.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.021
LISTEN,
ANY TIME FAMILY DINNER
TURNS INTO FAMILY LUNCH,

33:00.021 --> 33:01.762
IT'S GREAT FOR ME.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.721
I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE DELI
ALONE AT MY DESK.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.549
IT'S NOT REALLY
A FAMILY LUNCH
THING.

33:06.549 --> 33:09.770
ACTUALLY, WE ASKED
YOU GUYS HERE TO TALK.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.077
WHAT'S UP?

33:12.077 --> 33:13.948
IS ANYTHING WRONG?

33:18.039 --> 33:20.476
WE WANT YOU TO BUY
YOUR COMPANY, CHARLIE.

33:20.476 --> 33:23.001
BAILEY...

33:23.001 --> 33:25.046
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.917
AND WE WANNA BUY IT
WITH YOU.

33:29.311 --> 33:30.704
WHAT?

33:30.704 --> 33:32.227
BAILEY TOLD US
WHAT'S GOING ON,

33:32.227 --> 33:35.491
THAT YOU NEED
TO PUT SOMETHING UP
TO GET THIS LOAN,

33:35.491 --> 33:38.016
AND SO
WE TOOK A VOTE,

33:38.016 --> 33:40.931
AND WE WANT TO
PUT OUR SHARES OF
THE RESTAURANT IN.

33:45.371 --> 33:50.071
OK, LOOK, UM,
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS,
YOU GUYS, BUT--

33:50.071 --> 33:51.986
NO, IT'S NOT GENEROUS.
IT'S SMART.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.728
IT'S A BIG RISK, OK,
TO PUT ALL YOUR MONEY IN.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.686
WELL, WE THINK IT'D BE
RISKIER NOT TO.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.733
CHARLIE, IF WE DO THIS,

33:59.733 --> 34:02.562
THEN WE WOULD
OWN A PIECE
OF YOUR BUSINESS,

34:02.562 --> 34:04.912
AND WE FEEL LIKE...

34:04.912 --> 34:08.959
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO
OWN A PIECE OF SOMETHING
THAT'S GROWING

34:08.959 --> 34:11.266
THAN A PIECE OF
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.097
THIS IS DAD'S RESTAURANT.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.099
IT'S THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.449
I MEAN, IF SOMETHING
WERE TO GO WRONG,

34:20.449 --> 34:24.236
AND IT EASILY COULD,
AND WE WERE TO LOSE THAT...

34:24.236 --> 34:26.281
YEAH.

34:28.588 --> 34:32.244
YEAH, WE'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.984
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE THING IS,

34:33.984 --> 34:37.249
THE FAMILY
IS DIFFERENT NOW.

34:37.249 --> 34:41.949
I MEAN,
THE FAMILY IS US.

34:41.949 --> 34:45.344
AND MAYBE THE FAMILY
BUSINESS SHOULD BE
DIFFERENT, TOO.

34:49.304 --> 34:51.959
LISTEN, THEY TELL YOU
IN BUSINESS SCHOOL

34:51.959 --> 34:55.005
THAT YOU SHOULD PUT
YOUR MONEY IN SOMETHING
THAT YOU KNOW.

34:55.005 --> 34:59.140
WELL, I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU RUN THAT PLACE,
CHARLIE,

34:59.140 --> 35:02.143
AND WE ALL KNOW
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.668
THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
WE WOULD FEEL SAFER
IN BETTING ON RIGHT NOW

35:05.668 --> 35:07.757
THAN YOU.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.338
HERE YOU GO.

35:25.601 --> 35:28.474
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO,
GO CLEAN YOUR ROOM UP.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.084
ALL RIGHT.

35:30.084 --> 35:31.564
HI, CLAUD.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.695
HEY.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.396
VICTOR, WE HAVE TO TALK.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.659
LAST NIGHT FELT BAD.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.444
I KNOW.
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I LOST MY TEMPER.

35:42.444 --> 35:45.317
I'M NOT SAYING
I HAVE ANY RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE

35:45.317 --> 35:48.624
OR THAT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE
HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR JOB.

35:48.624 --> 35:49.756
IT'S JUST...

35:49.756 --> 35:53.803
ACTUALLY,
IT HAS EVERYTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

35:53.803 --> 35:56.328
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:58.156 --> 36:02.203
CLAUDIA, THE WOMAN
YOU SAW ME WITH,
HER NAME IS VALERIE.

36:02.203 --> 36:07.426
I KNEW HER BACK HOME
IN BROOKLYN. SHE WAS...

36:07.426 --> 36:10.472
I GUESS YOU WOULD
CALL HER MY GIRLFRIEND.

36:10.472 --> 36:12.822
YOU HAD A GIRLFRIEND?

36:12.822 --> 36:15.216
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THEN--

36:15.216 --> 36:19.655
GAY, STRAIGHT,
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.005
I WAS 19.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.490
WE DATED AWHILE...

36:30.710 --> 36:32.842
AND WE GOT PREGNANT.

36:35.410 --> 36:41.199
SHE WANTED TO MARRY ME,
BUT I SAID I COULDN'T.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.113
I WAS...

36:43.113 --> 36:47.596
STARTING TO REALIZE
SOME THINGS
ABOUT MYSELF.

36:47.596 --> 36:51.121
AND WHEN SHE ASKED ME TO
HELP HER WITH THE BABY,

36:51.121 --> 36:55.038
I GOT SCARED
AND CONFUSED...

36:57.519 --> 37:01.610
AND I JUST DIDN'T.

37:01.610 --> 37:05.353
SO SHE MOVED
OUT HERE TO LIVE
WITH HER PARENTS.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.921
VICTOR, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.444
LATER ON,

37:09.444 --> 37:14.362
WHEN I REALIZED
THAT I NEEDED
TO BE HERE FOR HER...

37:14.362 --> 37:16.843
FOR MY DAUGHTER...

37:19.237 --> 37:21.891
I SOLD EVERYTHING
AND MOVED.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.723
BUT VAL'S PARENTS
WON'T LET ME SEE HER,

37:27.723 --> 37:30.596
SO I DON'T GET
TO SEE HER.

37:33.294 --> 37:37.472
ANYWAY, UM, VAL LETS ME
GIVE THEM SOME MONEY
SOMETIMES,

37:37.472 --> 37:40.170
WHICH IS--THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAW, CLAUDIA.

37:43.435 --> 37:47.874
AND SHE GAVE ME
THIS PICTURE.

37:51.225 --> 37:54.054
IT WAS CHARLOTTE'S
6th BIRTHDAY.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.490
CHARLOTTE.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.449
SHE LOOKS LIKE YOU.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.146
YEAH.

38:02.192 --> 38:07.763
VAL'S PARENTS DON'T THINK
THAT I WANT THIS, BUT I DO.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.983
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

38:12.551 --> 38:15.989
I JUST WANT TO BE
A GOOD FATHER.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.304
ADAM!

38:26.304 --> 38:29.785
ARE YOU IN THERE?
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.096
YOU KNOW, ADAM,
I LISTEN TO YOU.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.402
WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST--

38:37.402 --> 38:38.403
OH, HEY.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.621
YOU MUST BE JULIA,
RIGHT?

38:39.621 --> 38:41.231
I'M BLAIR.

38:41.231 --> 38:42.755
HI.

38:44.452 --> 38:45.975
WHERE'S ADAM?

38:45.975 --> 38:47.803
UH, SPLIT FOR A WHILE.

38:47.803 --> 38:50.676
I'M CRASHING UNTIL
HE GETS BACK INTO TOWN.

38:50.676 --> 38:53.635
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE CABLE HOOKUP IS
IN HERE?

38:53.635 --> 38:54.984
I'M SORRY. DID YOU SAY
"BACK TO TOWN"?

38:54.984 --> 38:55.985
YEAH.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.770
KINDA IN BETWEEN
PLACES.

38:57.770 --> 39:00.381
OH, YEAH.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.949
HE LEFT
A MESSAGE FOR YOU
ON THE MACHINE.

39:14.830 --> 39:16.702
Adam: HEY, JULIA.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.965
WHAT CAN I SAY?

39:18.965 --> 39:21.141
I...I'M SORRY.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.404
I FEEL REALLY BAD
AND CONFUSED,

39:23.404 --> 39:24.927
SO I'M GONNA
TAKE OFF FOR A WHILE,

39:24.927 --> 39:26.929
YOU KNOW, TRY AND
WORK SOME STUFF OUT.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.454
I HAVE SOME FRIENDS
AT THIS COMMUNE IN MEXICO.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.847
UM, ANYWAY...

39:31.847 --> 39:33.806
JUST TRY AND FORGIVE ME.

39:33.806 --> 39:38.985
YOU SEE, YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
RIGHT IN MY LIFE NOW AND, UH...

39:38.985 --> 39:42.336
THAT'S KINDA NOT ENOUGH.

39:42.336 --> 39:46.514
SO, UH...SO I'LL SEE YOU.

39:46.514 --> 39:49.474
YEAH. I'LL SEE YOU.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.786
OK, LOOK, YOU CUT ME OFF
ON THE PHONE,

39:57.786 --> 40:01.007
AND THING IS,
THERE'S AN EXPLANATION
FOR EVERYTHING.

40:01.007 --> 40:02.400
TODD--

40:02.400 --> 40:03.705
CLAUDIA,
JUST LET ME SAY THIS.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.968
YOU ARE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL,

40:05.968 --> 40:09.494
MOST TALENTED,
MOST AMAZING GIRL
THAT I'VE EVER DATED.

40:09.494 --> 40:15.021
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
THE ONLYGIRL THAT I'VE
EVER DATED, BUT STILL...

40:15.021 --> 40:17.327
WHENEVER IT IS
THAT YOU NEEDED TO KNOW,

40:17.327 --> 40:19.417
OR WHENEVER IT IS THAT
I NEED TO TELL YOU--

40:19.417 --> 40:20.548
TODD, WAIT.

40:20.548 --> 40:23.812
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.035
YOU SHOULD JUST TELL ME
IF I NEED TO WORRY.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.645
WORRY?

40:30.645 --> 40:32.081
OF COURSE NOT.

40:32.081 --> 40:35.607
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.666
WHAT TIME IS IT?

40:53.363 --> 40:56.802
3 MINUTES LATER THAN
THE LAST TIME YOU ASKED.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.284
THINK WE SHOULD
CALL HIM?

41:01.284 --> 41:05.288
GUS WASN'T EXPECTING
A SECOND OFFER,
ESPECIALLY FROM ME.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.813
NOW, HE SAID HE WOULD CALL
WHEN HE HAD AN ANSWER.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.684
DID HE SPECIFY A YEAR?

41:11.164 --> 41:12.470
[RING]

41:20.390 --> 41:21.566
HELLO.
