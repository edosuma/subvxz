this purely hypothetical

01:51.198 --> 01:53.025
Say there was a killer

01:53.069 --> 01:56.159
whose modus operandi involved
clubbing his victims to death,

More alarming how?

02:28.931 --> 02:31.063
What if he no longer
feels any remorse?

02:31.107 --> 02:33.065
That he's somehow...

02:33.109 --> 02:36.068
energized by the killing?

02:38.114 --> 02:40.551
Well, that would suggest
an escalation,

02:40.595 --> 02:44.076
and we would be witnessing
the birth of a serial killer.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.731

03:34.692 --> 03:36.781

his latest victim.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.354

03:44.398 --> 03:46.530
Not necessarily. The castle's
been closed for a long time

It could just be

03:48.010 --> 03:50.230

to dump Jay's body.But if this killer

03:50.273 --> 03:52.754
is escalating, he may have
already planned his next kill.

An ancient form of
torturous murder,

05:31.635 --> 05:33.768
also as known
as "The Boats."

05:33.811 --> 05:36.640
It comes from the Greek word
"skáphe," meaning "scooped out."

05:36.684 --> 05:39.426

the Achaemenid Empire

05:39.469 --> 05:41.428

05:55.877 --> 05:59.054

on Plutarch.

09:53.810 --> 09:54.768
How is that relevant?

09:54.811 --> 09:56.117
It's not. Dr. O'Hare,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.249
we don't think
your husband made it to Sedona.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.251
We ran his fingerprint.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.339
Every lawyer
in New York is fing...

10:01.383 --> 10:02.819
Fingerprinted, yes, I know.
Well...

10:02.863 --> 10:05.996
run it again.
There must be some mistake.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.956
Did your husband have
an unusual tattoo on his arm?

10:08.999 --> 10:10.653
Looks like... something

10:10.697 --> 10:12.133
from a law review citation?

10:12.176 --> 10:15.266
He did. How...?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
How did this happen?

10:17.268 --> 10:19.444
When was the last time
you saw him?

10:19.488 --> 10:23.144
We went to dinner and The Met
the night before he left.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.275
What did you see?

10:24.319 --> 10:27.452
Tosca,his favorite.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.151
Oh, my God. Poor, sweet Tom.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.631
DYLAN:
I thought

10:31.674 --> 10:33.807
you two were...
separated.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.418
We are, yes.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.463
Our marriage,
like a lot

10:38.507 --> 10:39.987
of others, is complicated.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.337
But if he died, you stood
to inherit his millions.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.905
I would, yes.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.908
So you should know that
Tom asked me to move back home.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.781
I said okay if he cut back
his hours at work.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.000
Did he agree to that?

10:53.043 --> 10:55.176
Tom's a workaholic,

10:55.219 --> 10:57.395
which is why
he went on that retreat--

10:57.439 --> 10:58.701
to examine his life.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.008
LIZZIE: Given your
husband's profession,

11:01.051 --> 11:03.010
I imagine he had a few enemies.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.707
Hundreds.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.405
He had a 20-year practice.
He was a formidable enemy.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.538
But if he was
on your side,

11:09.581 --> 11:11.845
there's nothing he
wouldn't do for you.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.063
Did any of those enemies

11:13.107 --> 11:15.109
ever make
a specific threat against him?

11:15.152 --> 11:16.676
Constantly.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.156
I think he enjoyed it.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.463
Although there was one
recently that was so bad

11:21.506 --> 11:23.291
he had to take out
a restraining order.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.728
LIZZIE:
Do you have a name?

11:25.772 --> 11:28.905
Next time, how about we--
and by "we," I mean you--

11:28.949 --> 11:30.254
not browse the books.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.821
We were there to
investigate a murder,

11:31.865 --> 11:33.823
not geek out
about Plato.Plutarch.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.912
[groans] He could be
Plut-o for all I care.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.393
Except Plato wasn't one
of the two historical writers

11:38.436 --> 11:40.612
to document scaphism,
and Pluto is a cartoon dog.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.658
So don't knock
book browsing.
I wasn't.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.834
And Toscais full
of depictions of torture,

11:44.878 --> 11:47.750
murder and suicide,
so don't knock opera, either.

11:47.794 --> 11:48.882
I wasn't.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.884
Margot's dissertation was
on Plutarch,

11:50.927 --> 11:53.538
so the whole "poor sweet Tom"
thing was an act?

11:53.582 --> 11:55.671
On the one hand,
if she divorced O'Hare,

11:55.715 --> 11:56.977
she'd be going up against
one of the most

11:57.020 --> 11:59.283
ruthless divorce lawyers
in New York City.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.764
She stood to lose
a lot of money, hers andhis.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.027
On the other hand,
this wasn't just a murder,

12:04.071 --> 12:06.203
it was torture.
Whoever did this to O'Hare

12:06.247 --> 12:08.510
wanted to be with him
to see him suffer.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.729
We should do
some digging,

12:09.772 --> 12:11.643
find out where she's
been the past few weeks,

12:11.687 --> 12:13.036
look at her financials.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.169
If she knocked him out,
she'd have to put one canoe

12:15.212 --> 12:16.953
on top of another
with his body in between.

12:16.997 --> 12:18.302
I'm not sure
she's capable of that.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.175
Love and hate can make
people do crazy things.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.265
As my mom always said, "You
want to get to know someone,

12:24.308 --> 12:26.484
divorce them."

12:26.528 --> 12:27.747
You put a lot of thought

12:27.790 --> 12:30.227
into your threats
against O'Hare, Sara.

12:30.271 --> 12:31.838
Ever try to act
on any of them?

Words were the
only ammunition

12:33.491 --> 12:35.450

12:35.493 --> 12:37.669
You certainly caught
his attention.

12:37.713 --> 12:38.888

12:38.932 --> 12:40.542
A restraining order.
Can you believe it?

12:40.585 --> 12:42.370
The big bad wolf afraid
of little old me?

12:42.413 --> 12:44.459
You don't seem too broken up
about his death.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.461
The fact that
I am not doing cartwheels

12:46.504 --> 12:47.810
demonstrates progress.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.944
My life coach helped
me realize that

12:50.987 --> 12:54.512
I was letting Tom
live rent-free, up here.

12:54.556 --> 12:55.818
It's not healthy.

12:55.862 --> 12:57.951
So it's a slow-moving eviction?

12:57.994 --> 13:00.997

I met my husband
on a dating app.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.259
He was Mr. Perfect.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.000
Then, once we
get married,

13:04.044 --> 13:06.437
I notice money being drained
from my bank account.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.526
He did it to
four other women.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
Mr. Perfect
was a con man.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.573
So why threaten O'Hare?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.836
Why? O'Hare represented him.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.882
He knew my ex was
a lying lowlife,

13:15.925 --> 13:17.709
and yet I lost my town house

13:17.753 --> 13:20.147

it took me seven years to build.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.844

His name is Lon Vicars.

O'Hare represented

a confession?

a successful jewelry store

14:42.751 --> 14:44.840

during the divorce proceedings

14:44.884 --> 14:47.669
that Vicars had beaten his wife.

14:47.712 --> 14:48.800
Was it true?

14:48.844 --> 14:51.281
Yes. But from
Vicars' perspective,

14:51.325 --> 14:52.630
he felt his life had been ruined

14:52.674 --> 14:55.068
because O'Hare had tarnished
his reputation.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.766
Vicars blamed O'Hare

Getting revenge can often make

Yeah.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.145
Well, now who's
gonna punch me in the face?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.017
He was a med student,

19:09.060 --> 19:10.323
studying abroad from Germany.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.325
We used protection,
so I guess I'm one

19:12.368 --> 19:14.588
of the lucky two percenters
it didn't work for.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.329
[chuckles] Maybe I
should play the lottery.

19:16.372 --> 19:18.331
But he was
really smart,

19:18.374 --> 19:19.854
and tall,

19:19.897 --> 19:22.073
so hopefully the baby
will inherit that.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.424
I told him about it,
and lo and behold,

19:24.467 --> 19:26.948
he had to go back to
Stuttgart. [chuckles]

19:26.991 --> 19:30.212
Sorry. Pregnancy brain.
What was your question?

19:30.256 --> 19:32.475
Do you like lemon
in your ice tea?

19:32.519 --> 19:34.042
Oh, right. Love it.

19:34.085 --> 19:37.263
But it makes me hurl
ever since I got pregnant.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.181
No.Oh.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.966
The articles I read said we
should stick to light subjects.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.490
I think we probably
read the same ones.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.666
So how about
this heat wave, huh?

19:50.972 --> 19:53.279

in a bar-- yourbar--

19:53.322 --> 19:54.802

19:54.845 --> 19:57.021
I hate small talk.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.937
Can we just be real?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.112

Andy told me
I'd like you.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.289
Are you...

20:03.332 --> 20:05.421
still thinking
of moving back to Sacramento?

20:05.465 --> 20:08.946
I made that decision
in a moment of panic.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.688
And then Igot real.

20:11.732 --> 20:14.082
I can't be a single mom.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.476
This baby deserves

20:16.519 --> 20:19.957
a good, happy life,

20:20.001 --> 20:24.005
and that is something
I know I won't be able to give.

20:24.048 --> 20:27.443
Well, we would give this baby
all the love and care

20:27.487 --> 20:29.271

20:29.315 --> 20:30.664
Thank you.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.014
That means a lot.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.364
Is there anything
you want to know about us?

Triple Paste,

20:38.324 --> 20:40.630
rice formula, car seats?

20:40.674 --> 20:42.284
Actually, since you
mentioned car seats,

20:42.328 --> 20:44.155
I couldn't help but
notice that helmet.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.375
Oh, yeah.
That's mine.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.594
I-I ride a motorcycle.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.683
But not every day.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.339
My uncle died in
a motorcycle accident.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.558
Oh, I'm a very safe rider.
I've never had an accident.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.734
I'd be happy to share
my driver record with you.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.697
So you prefer I lie to her?

21:03.740 --> 21:06.700
Did you hear
what she was saying?I've been riding

21:06.743 --> 21:08.528
a motorcycle longer
than she has been alive.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.356
I know the risks
and I avoid them.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.228
Dylan, all Sam sees when she
looks at that motorcycle helmet

21:13.272 --> 21:15.056
is her dead uncle,
who didn't drive

21:15.099 --> 21:16.710
as safe as you.I know there are

21:16.753 --> 21:18.059
certain sacrifices
that have to be made

21:18.102 --> 21:19.539
when we bring a child
into our home.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.236
But you know what
that bike means to me.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.759
Where do we draw the line, Andy?

21:22.803 --> 21:24.805
Do we let someone else
dictate our entire lives?Dylan,

21:24.848 --> 21:26.372
this is not
a lecture hall, okay?

21:26.415 --> 21:28.330
This is about us,
about our family.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.897
What if Sam's uncle had died
of alcohol poisoning

21:29.940 --> 21:31.507
and she wanted you
to give up the bar?

21:31.551 --> 21:33.161
Come on,
you're being ridiculous.Why?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.728
Because it's your thing
and not my thing?

22:04.888 --> 22:07.761
or have you just...
been here for two weeks?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.632
Of course I left.
I wouldn't lie to you.

You just never say anything.

I knew you were working,

22:15.682 --> 22:17.640

later tonight.

22:17.684 --> 22:21.122
Why? Why does everything
always have to be a surprise?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.297
It's romantic.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.821
No, it's convenient for you.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.171
I'm not even available tonight.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.175
Okay.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.180
Sorry.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.190
I missed you.

22:48.192 --> 22:52.196
Going to work has never
been so burdensome.

beautiful you are.

It's nothing.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.147
What happened?

23:30.191 --> 23:32.193
I can't talk about it.

23:35.196 --> 23:38.199
Then we have
nothing left to say.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.164
Good night.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.692
I don't want to talk about it.
How was your meeting with Sam?

23:52.735 --> 23:54.041
I don't want to talk about it.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.608
Oh.

23:55.651 --> 23:58.088
Well, good thing
we have a murder to solve.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.090
So...

24:00.134 --> 24:02.092
I was in the ring with Ryan.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.007
What?

24:04.051 --> 24:06.009
You were sparring with Ryan?

24:06.053 --> 24:07.228
Please don't be jealous.

24:07.271 --> 24:09.926
Anyway, he hit me
with a hard left,

24:09.970 --> 24:12.276
which made me rethink the
bruise on O'Hare's head.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.104
So I went to the morgue
to look at it again.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.541
It's a pretty serious dent.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.368
And it's on the right-hand side
of his head.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.545
Yes, and now Doug thinks
that he was hit from the front,

24:19.588 --> 24:21.721
which means odds are strong
that whoever did it

24:21.764 --> 24:23.462
was a lefty.Which rules out Lon Vicars

24:23.505 --> 24:25.028
because he only drank
with his right hand.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.553
Maybe Vicars had a partner
he didn't tell us about.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.206
Maybe he was protecting
his partner. But who?

24:30.338 --> 24:32.601
LIZZIE:
The wife. Goddess of Plutarch.

24:32.645 --> 24:35.038
She had motive
and knowledge of scaphism.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.563
But nothing on Vicars' phone
suggests that he knew her.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.695
Lon Vicars was a victim
of O'Hare's lawyering.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.262
Maybe someone
with a similar motive?

24:41.305 --> 24:42.524
Like chirpy little Sara?

Well, she's one of thousands
who hate O'Hare.

we can find the rest.

That marriage
was killing Mr. O'Hare.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.975

28:40.675 --> 28:43.112
Definitely you.Me? Why me?

28:43.156 --> 28:45.811
Seriously? Uh, one:
you're a guy.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.813
Two: you're older than me.

28:47.856 --> 28:50.816
Three: I can't die until I run
screaming through the woods

28:50.859 --> 28:52.731
and trip in front
of a masked killer.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.471
Well, I think you
would die first

28:54.515 --> 28:55.646
because one: you're blonde.[Lizzie scoffs]

28:55.690 --> 28:57.518
Two: blondes always die
before brunettes.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.216
And three: though I may not
be brunette anymore,

29:00.260 --> 29:01.783
I am definitely not a blonde,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.480
so you...

29:03.524 --> 29:06.527
die... first.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.195
Police! Open up.

29:25.676 --> 29:26.808
Ready?

29:26.852 --> 29:28.810
[grunts]
Oof.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.813
[coughs] Oh, God.Oh, oh.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.859
[flies buzzing]

29:37.688 --> 29:39.690
[Lizzie exhales]

29:41.301 --> 29:44.304
[coughing]

29:47.176 --> 29:49.135
[Lizzie groans]

29:57.621 --> 30:00.015
Well, we found the kill site.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.582
[Dylan coughs]

30:01.625 --> 30:03.540
DYLAN:
Sweet Sara's

30:03.584 --> 30:05.673
weaponized words
have got nothing on this.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.893
Good thing she likes to talk.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.156
I have nothing to say.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.553
Any luck?He spilled his guts,

30:16.597 --> 30:18.729
but without a lawyer,
Sara won't say a word.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.775
Keep me posted.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.520
Any luck?

30:26.563 --> 30:29.175
Yes, Sara uses an
encrypted chat client.

30:29.218 --> 30:32.004
What's that?It's a way
of sharing anonymous messages

30:32.047 --> 30:33.875
without being tracked
or identified.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.879
So, let's see what Sara doesn't
want anyone else to know.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.100
This is interesting.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.058
Here's a thread between
three different users

30:43.102 --> 30:45.191
that might be helpful.

30:45.234 --> 30:46.714
There was a third person
involved?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.194
Seems that way, yes.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.196
So they're not just partners.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.719
A conspiracy.

30:58.030 --> 31:00.902
"Next week he leaves for his
retreat. We'll subdue him

31:00.946 --> 31:02.773
at his house and take
him to your cabin."

31:02.817 --> 31:04.166
DYLAN: A second user
replied, "Okay,

31:04.210 --> 31:06.821
all materials will
be ready there?"

31:06.865 --> 31:08.301
To which the third
user answers,

31:08.344 --> 31:10.303
"Are you sure there are no
cameras around his place?"

31:10.346 --> 31:12.827
And that's when the first user
responded again.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.786
"Yes. Stop worrying about that.
Get your head straight."

31:15.830 --> 31:17.049
Okay, so, we know

31:17.092 --> 31:18.877
that one of these people
is probably Sara

31:18.920 --> 31:20.313
because her cabin is referenced.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.315
Vicars could be the anxious one
asking questions.

31:22.358 --> 31:25.318
So the two of them are
merely minions taking orders

31:25.361 --> 31:27.233
from an autocratic leader.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.974
Three strangers brought together

31:29.017 --> 31:30.497
by their mutual
and intense hatred

31:30.540 --> 31:32.847
of one common enemy:
Thomas O'Hare.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.588
But how did
these three strangers

31:34.631 --> 31:36.242
initially find one another?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.591
JULIAN: Well, the first
user is very aware

31:37.634 --> 31:39.158
of O'Hare's intimate details,

31:39.201 --> 31:41.725
like his home address
and alarm codes.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.989
Sounds like
it could be his wife.HARRIS: Speaking of his wife,

31:44.032 --> 31:46.121
her department head finally
called back. Turns out

31:46.165 --> 31:48.297
Margot took a last-minute
personal absence leave

31:48.341 --> 31:50.256
three weeks ago.How long for?

31:50.299 --> 31:51.910
Two weeks. And when
she returned, she refused

31:51.953 --> 31:55.391
to tell anyone where she went,
why, what she was doing.

31:55.435 --> 31:56.566
That's about the same window
of time

31:56.610 --> 31:57.916
it took Tom to be kidnapped,

31:57.959 --> 32:00.396
tortured and killed.Time to bring her in.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.837
Scaphism?

32:06.881 --> 32:08.927
That's how Tom died?

32:08.970 --> 32:10.841
So you're familiar
with the practice?

32:10.885 --> 32:14.149
It's unimaginable. Then and now.

32:14.193 --> 32:15.498
DYLAN:
You would know.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.196
So knowledge equals guilt?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.719
LIZZIE:
Among other things.

32:18.762 --> 32:21.330
You had motive, and shortly
after Tom left for his trip,

32:21.374 --> 32:23.158
you were a no-show at
work for two weeks.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.986
You also made
a sizable withdrawal

32:25.030 --> 32:26.596
from your bank account.LIZZIE:
Did you pay

32:26.640 --> 32:27.858
Vicars to help you?

32:27.902 --> 32:29.251
No.

32:30.861 --> 32:33.995
I paid Dr. Corinne Naylor

32:34.039 --> 32:36.041
to do my face-lift.

32:36.084 --> 32:37.868
And tummy tuck.

32:37.912 --> 32:40.436
I was getting ready
for what I thought

32:40.480 --> 32:42.482
would be my second honeymoon.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.441
I loved Tom.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.008
So you keep telling us.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.923
But you're also a teacher.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.881
Maybe you taught Vicars
about scaphism.

32:50.925 --> 32:55.103
I mention it a few times a year
in my lectures.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.366
I am no expert.

32:57.410 --> 32:59.020
You're welcome to read them.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.717
How soon can you
get them to us?

33:00.761 --> 33:03.024
I'd have to ask Becca.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.548
Becca Horner?

33:05.592 --> 33:09.596
Tom's paralegal, she transcribes
them for me for extra cash.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.991
Oh, my God.

33:13.034 --> 33:16.298
She had all of his alarm codes.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.605
She knew his schedule.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.781
Turns out Becca Horner
wasn't born Becca Horner.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.304
Her given name
was Rebecca Johnson.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.132
Horner was her
mother's maiden name.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.439
She changed it after her parents
divorced a few years ago.

33:26.482 --> 33:29.050
Let me guess, O'Hare represented
her father in that divorce?

33:29.094 --> 33:31.922
Indeed.
Despite a string of DWIs

33:31.966 --> 33:34.534
and a history of alcohol abuse,
O'Hare made sure

33:34.577 --> 33:37.276
that dear old dad got custody
of her younger sister.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.713
That's a story that probably
doesn't end well.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.280
It ends with Becca's kid sister

33:41.323 --> 33:43.108
being fatally injured
in a boating accident.

33:43.151 --> 33:46.067
Dad blew twice the legal limit
on the Breathalyzer.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.635
And that may be why she used
the boats as a murder method.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.419
LIZZIE:
Becca was studying abroad
when all of this happened,

33:50.463 --> 33:52.595
the custody decision,
the accident...

33:52.639 --> 33:55.250
Her sister suffered for 12 days
in extreme pain

33:55.294 --> 33:56.947
before succumbing
to her injuries.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.645
LIZZIE:
The same amount of time
the ME estimated

33:58.688 --> 34:00.516
that O'Hare was tortured.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.909
Good story.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.476
Very circumstantial, though.

34:03.519 --> 34:04.520
We need a confession.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.740
We think we know
how to get one.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.698
What'd you have in mind?

34:08.742 --> 34:10.744
We put Sara in the conference
room with Detective Clark.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.354
He'll be undercover
as another suspect;

34:12.398 --> 34:14.226
that way, she'll trust him more.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.358
LIZZIE:
Officer Clark will encourage
her to play a game with him.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.447
Something that requires
putting pen to paper.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.058
DYLAN:
And then,
after we pick up Becca,

34:20.101 --> 34:22.190
we'll parade her past Sara.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.236
Oh, looks like Sara hasn't
finished writing out

34:24.279 --> 34:25.889
her confession
for Detective Clark yet.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.109
LIZZIE:
Hmm. She must have a lot to say.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.546
DYLAN:
That's when we turn up
the heat. Literally.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.897
We put her in the stuffy,
unventilated box

34:33.941 --> 34:35.595
and let her stew
in her own thoughts.

34:35.638 --> 34:36.813
LIZZIE:
After an hour or two,

34:36.857 --> 34:39.033
when her anger reaches
a boiling point,

34:39.077 --> 34:41.209
we bring in
our secret ingredient.

34:41.253 --> 34:42.906
JASMINE:
Do you think that'll work?
That Becca will turn on Sara?

34:42.950 --> 34:45.213
DYLAN:
When push comes to shove,

34:45.257 --> 34:47.433
Becca's survival instinct
will kick in.

34:47.476 --> 34:50.088
Untrustworthy people have
difficulty trusting others.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.090
Even when they're telling
the truth.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.919
Did you have a nice talk
with the detective?

34:55.963 --> 34:58.574
What are you talking about?
I didn't say anything to anyone.

34:58.618 --> 35:01.316
I saw you in the conference
room, writing your confession.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.231
Confession?

35:03.275 --> 35:06.930
I was playing word search
with another suspect.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.933
You must think I'm a special
kind of stupid.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.244
It crossed my mind
when the body turned up.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.203
You said no one
would ever find it.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.769
That Lon weighed it down
with stones.

35:19.813 --> 35:20.901
Would you keep your mouth shut!?

35:20.944 --> 35:22.250
[screams] Oh, God.
Get your hands off me.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.992
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.She attacked me.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.037
Whatever she told you, don't
believe her, she's a liar.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.387
Not my impression.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.953
I didn't say anything.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.520
I am still waiting
for my lawyer.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.740
Yeah, right. Did she tell you
that I never touched Tom?

35:33.783 --> 35:35.133
That she and Lon did
all the torturing?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.221
She killed him.

35:36.264 --> 35:39.572
You ran the whole operation.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.530
She spent months looking

35:41.574 --> 35:43.489
for people who hated O'Hare
as much as she did.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.099
She's the one
who got us all together.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.579
What they did
to Tom was sick.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.755
I was joking about all that
scaphism stuff!

35:48.798 --> 35:51.714
Oh, please.
She was at the cabin, too.

35:51.758 --> 35:54.195
I recorded all our phone calls.
You can hear for yourself.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.849
I can't believe
you sold me out.

35:55.892 --> 35:58.417
Actually,
yousold herout first.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.070
What about her
written confession?

36:00.114 --> 36:02.160
No, Sara was telling
the truth.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.291
They were just doing
a word search.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.772
Detective Clark.
Nice to meet you.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.606
Just stick to the facts.

36:13.649 --> 36:14.998
The Chief of Ds does not need

36:15.042 --> 36:17.436
an entire dissertation
on the nature of revenge.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.439
Oh, then I guess I'm done.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.442
And since I am,
could you call Margot?

36:23.485 --> 36:25.792
Tom did want her back.

36:25.835 --> 36:28.447
Julian checked his computer
and found out that his retreat

36:28.490 --> 36:30.797
was actually a rehab
for workaholics.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.320
Huh.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.975
New Yorkers are messed up.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.107
It's called a boat
and a fishing rod.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.022
[chuckles]

36:40.981 --> 36:42.678
How did Julian sound?

36:44.637 --> 36:46.160
Why don't you call him?

36:51.426 --> 36:53.994
DYLAN: Well, thanks
for your help today.

36:54.037 --> 36:56.649
Glad I could make progress
on somebody's case.

36:56.692 --> 36:59.173
Hmm. Go, go, go,
and patience.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.392
Duality.
Mm-hmm.

37:00.435 --> 37:01.654
Thanks for the ride.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.917
Hey, what happened
to your bike?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.485
Oh, I just thought
I might enjoy

37:06.528 --> 37:09.227
driving something else
for the moment.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.012
Hmm.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.057
[chuckles]

37:39.648 --> 37:42.260
Has he killed again?

37:43.913 --> 37:46.264
Or are you next?

37:50.920 --> 37:55.229
Seeing you hurt...
that's hard.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.275
I know.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.235
Not knowing
where you were...

38:01.279 --> 38:05.892
when or if I'd ever
hear from you again.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.894
It's the nature of my work.

38:07.937 --> 38:11.724
I know and I respect
what you do for a living.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.769
But...

38:15.858 --> 38:19.732
But I've been through that
in the past.

38:19.775 --> 38:24.302
And... before this gets
any more serious,

38:24.345 --> 38:27.261
maybe we should
just cut our losses

38:27.305 --> 38:30.395
before one of us
really gets hurt.

38:30.438 --> 38:33.441
Well, it's too late for me.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.097
I've already fallen in love
with you.

38:40.056 --> 38:43.190
But I do understand.

38:43.233 --> 38:46.149
My job isn't something
I can walk away from.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.417
It doesn't mean
they can't coexist.

38:52.460 --> 38:56.464
[crying]:
Maybe they... can.

38:56.508 --> 39:01.121
But... n-not for me.

39:01.164 --> 39:05.647
I can't live like this, Julian.

39:05.691 --> 39:09.434
It's why I need to walk away
from us.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.177
[sniffles]

39:27.843 --> 39:29.149
[exhales]

39:30.846 --> 39:32.152
Hey.

39:32.195 --> 39:35.155
Hey.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.983
Okay, so the
heatwave broke,

39:37.026 --> 39:39.942
the AC is fixed and
now you're sweating?

39:39.986 --> 39:42.205
Mm. Hyperhidrosis.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.294
[clears throat]
Emotional sweating.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.861
Okay. And why is
this happening?

39:45.905 --> 39:47.036
Because...You know what?

39:47.080 --> 39:49.256
Before you even
say anything, I...

39:49.299 --> 39:51.867
I would like to apologize.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.827
You were right.
You-you shouldn't have to...

39:54.870 --> 39:57.177
give up something you love just
so that we can start a family.

39:57.220 --> 40:00.485
I've decided to sell
my motorcycle.Oh, thank God.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.357
Nothing is or should be
more important

40:03.401 --> 40:04.706
than us starting a family.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.448
What made you change your mind?

40:07.492 --> 40:10.843
Well, I've been reflecting
a lot, recently,

40:10.886 --> 40:13.498
on the nature of duality...You know what?

40:13.541 --> 40:15.195
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.936
I am gonna call Sam
and let her know.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.328
Oh, I-I already did.

40:18.372 --> 40:19.808
I-I thought we could
tell her together.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.201
Absolutely.

40:21.244 --> 40:22.550
Yes, uh, great.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.857
W-When?[doorbell rings]

40:25.814 --> 40:27.599
How about now?
[chuckles]

40:27.642 --> 40:28.861
Is-is now good?

40:34.170 --> 40:36.912
Sam, come on in.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.656
Thanks-thanks so much
for coming over.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.831
It sounded important.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.442
Uh, it is.

40:44.485 --> 40:45.660
Can I get you anything?

40:45.704 --> 40:47.532
Uh, without any lemons,
of course.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.011
No, I'm good. Hey, Andy.

40:49.055 --> 40:51.710
Hey, Sam.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.712
What did you need to talk about?

40:53.755 --> 40:56.889
[clears throat]

40:56.932 --> 41:00.675
I got my first motorcycle
when I was 16.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.286
Back then,
it was the only thing

41:03.330 --> 41:05.811
that made me feel free.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.988
It came to feel
like a part of me.

41:09.031 --> 41:13.688
But, I realized, not nearly
as much as our child will be.

41:15.255 --> 41:18.519
I understand your concerns and
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna sell my bike.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.869
Wow.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.915
I definitely wasn't expecting
to hear that.

41:22.958 --> 41:25.700
No pressure.

41:25.744 --> 41:28.050
[exhales]

41:28.094 --> 41:30.400
Actually, I've been doing
a lot of thinking, too.

41:30.444 --> 41:33.055
When I left, I realized
I've been through almost

41:33.099 --> 41:36.102
a dozen birth parent
applications.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.408
Everybody has pluses
and minuses.

41:38.452 --> 41:41.237
I know I do.

41:41.281 --> 41:45.764
It was between you guys
and one other couple.

41:45.807 --> 41:50.116
Until you, uh... found out
I ride a motorcycle.

41:50.159 --> 41:52.248
Yes.

41:52.292 --> 41:55.861
And what I want for my child
more than anything

41:55.904 --> 41:59.429
is that he or she is loved.

41:59.473 --> 42:02.258
When I think about
how Andy lights up

42:02.302 --> 42:06.001
every time he talks to you
or about you,

42:06.045 --> 42:08.090
or when you two held hands
the other day,

42:08.134 --> 42:11.572
I realized...

42:11.616 --> 42:14.662
this child will be loved.

42:14.706 --> 42:18.405
Because with you two,
it's already baked in.

42:18.448 --> 42:20.755
Are...

42:20.799 --> 42:21.930
Are you saying...?

42:21.974 --> 42:25.412
I'm asking...

42:27.457 --> 42:30.156
Will you be this baby's parents?

42:32.158 --> 42:33.942
Yes. Yes.

42:33.986 --> 42:35.509
Yes, yes.
A thousand times yes.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.641
[laughing, crying]

42:36.684 --> 42:39.992
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.474
W-We're gonna have a baby.[chuckles]
