00:00.067 --> 00:03.235
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> my brother and I</i>
<i> never liked the same music.</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:07.172
<i> That is, until we heard</i>
<i> a group that would change</i>
<i> our lives forever.</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:09.274
<i> ¶ Well, I'm Mike D,</i>
<i> and I'm back from the dead</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:11.910
<i> ¶ Chillin' at the beach</i>
<i> down at club med ¶</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:12.945
ADULT ADAM:
<i> The Beastie Boys.</i>

00:12.947 --> 00:15.280
<i> To us,</i>
<i> they weren't just</i>
<i> a rap group.</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:16.248
<i> They were a way of life.</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:19.585
<i> We copied their videos</i>
<i> and memorized</i>
<i> every single lyric.</i>

00:19.587 --> 00:22.554
<i> Simply put,</i>
<i> they were a game-changer.</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:24.223
I'm telling you, dude,
if Mike D met us,

00:24.225 --> 00:27.693
he would be like,
"We should be best friends."
For sure!

00:27.695 --> 00:28.794
We're practically related.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.964
They rap, they party hard,
and they're in the tribe.

00:31.966 --> 00:35.267
All three of them!
What are the chances?

00:35.269 --> 00:35.868
Wait a minute.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.636
Do you realize
what this means?

00:37.638 --> 00:40.205
If the Beasties
can make it,
so can we.

00:40.207 --> 00:40.939
Answer me this.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.841
Do we not have
a license to ill?

00:42.843 --> 00:45.511
Dude, you spelled
"license" wrong.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.312
Don't pass this offer up,
Ad-Rock.

00:47.314 --> 00:48.580
I think you have
what it takes

00:48.582 --> 00:52.451
to join my Beastie Boys
inspired supergroup,
The Tasty Boys.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.920
Could we give it
five more minutes
on the name?

00:54.922 --> 00:55.754
No!
The name has stuck.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.624
You'd really let me
into your rap supergroup?

00:58.626 --> 00:59.124
Of course.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.760
Your weird voice sounds
like you have a young man

01:01.762 --> 01:03.228
and an old woman
stuck in your body,

01:03.230 --> 01:05.064
so I'll clearly be
the breakout star.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.598
I accept!

01:06.700 --> 01:08.033
Ill.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.601
We are so ill.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.837
Who's ill?
Oh, my God, get to bed.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.539
No one's
going to school today.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.340
But...
Ba-ba-ba!

01:15.476 --> 01:16.275
We're both ill and sick.

01:16.277 --> 01:20.746
I guess the only thing
I can do is wait on you hand
and foot in front of the TV.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.413
Come on. Yeah.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.049
Being a rap star
is awesome!

01:27.288 --> 01:28.520
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:28.522 --> 01:32.991
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:35.062 --> 01:35.794
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:35.796 --> 01:40.332
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:40.334 --> 01:42.434
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> January 6, 1980-something.</i>

01:42.436 --> 01:44.336
<i> The fateful day my mom</i>
<i> first laid eyes</i>

01:44.338 --> 01:47.106
<i> on our neighbors'</i>
<i> new kitchen.</i>
Ta-da!

01:47.108 --> 01:47.906
<i> Everything was brand-new.</i>

01:47.908 --> 01:53.078
<i> It was an '80s architectural</i>
<i> masterpiece of Formica</i>
<i> in every shade of brown.</i>

01:53.080 --> 01:56.014
Is that a lazy Susan?
It is!

01:56.016 --> 01:57.683
Is this almond-colored?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.051
It's beautiful.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.185
Like dirty snow.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.088
This linoleum,
it looks like real tile.

02:03.090 --> 02:05.057
Oh, it spins around!

02:05.059 --> 02:07.793
Look! The cinnamon
was in the back,
and now it's in the front!

02:07.795 --> 02:11.730
And the best part,
Charles did
the whole thing himself,

02:11.732 --> 02:12.998
and it cost
half the price.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.399
Get out.
I swear.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.100
No, get out of my way.

02:15.102 --> 02:19.771
Move your body.
I must speak to Murray now.
Wha...

02:19.773 --> 02:21.340
We're getting
a new kitchen.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.841
What's wrong
with the old kitchen?

02:22.843 --> 02:23.942
You just said it.
It's old.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.645
It doesn't have
what I need in a kitchen.
Hello, Bill.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.615
All you need in the kitchen
is food and forks.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.482
And maybe a cup or two.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.918
Also, you'd be surprised
how often you use a juicer.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.988
Then it's settled.
We're gonna get a juicer.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.723
Damn it, Bevy,
you win again.

02:37.725 --> 02:40.192
I mean it.
We need to renovate.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.261
This thing
should be in a museum.

02:42.263 --> 02:45.864
A museum
of ugly refrigerators.
Blech!

02:45.866 --> 02:46.932
And look at this floor.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.568
No, don't.
It'll give you a seizure.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.703
And what about these
lazy-Susan-less cabinets?

02:51.705 --> 02:55.240
I've got to move the other
spices out of the way
like a wild animal.

02:55.242 --> 02:58.477
Like, "Oh, here's
the tarragon." Oh.
(CLATTERING)

02:58.479 --> 03:00.179
And now
I'm stressed out.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.013
She did make a mess.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.782
Bevy, I'd love to give you
a new kitchen,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.384
but it would cost
a fortune.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.718
And the
materials alone...

03:06.720 --> 03:09.488
I'm a tile man.
I'll hook you up
for free.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.191
Yeah, but the labor.
I'll install it myself.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.659
Bill, read the room.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.426
I see
what this is about.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.129
You don't want this
'cause you're
afraid of change.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.031
(SCOFFS)
What are you
talking about?

03:19.033 --> 03:19.932
You're
a creature of habit.

03:19.934 --> 03:24.169
For the last 10 years,
you've had the same job,
same car, same clothes.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.804
Just because I like
things a certain way

03:25.806 --> 03:27.673
doesn't mean
I'm a creature of habit.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.907
Then how do
you explain this?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.810
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> Coca-Cola announced new coke,</i>

03:31.812 --> 03:33.912
<i> which sent their old-school</i>
<i> customers into a tailspin.</i>

03:33.914 --> 03:38.016
The second
you find out that coke
is changing their recipe,

03:38.018 --> 03:38.984
you start to stockpile.

03:38.986 --> 03:43.488
What kind of person
is afraid of new coke?
It's nuts.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.289
I'm not afraid.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.824
I just like
the old-timey original kind.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.326
Okay, see?
You're just
proving my point.

03:47.328 --> 03:51.530
Bevy, I try new stuff.
Like that big pink orange
I ate that one time.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.497
The grapefruit?

03:52.499 --> 03:54.633
Yeah.
Never again.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.868
The point is,
I love change.

03:56.870 --> 04:01.173
Well, there's gonna be
some big changes
around here.

04:01.175 --> 04:01.740
Big changes!

04:01.742 --> 04:03.342
ADULT ADAM: <i> As my mom</i>
<i> was laying down the law,</i>

04:03.344 --> 04:05.644
<i> Barry was laying down</i>
<i> some tracks.</i>
(BEATBOXING)

04:05.646 --> 04:07.713
<i> ¶ Good afternoon,</i>
<i> my name is Barry</i>

04:07.715 --> 04:11.416
<i> ¶ I came to get down,</i>
<i> and my rhymes are scary ¶</i>

04:11.418 --> 04:12.317
You morons!

04:12.319 --> 04:14.119
I told you to stop going
in my room

04:14.121 --> 04:15.487
and stealing
my old glasses.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.990
But we need 'em
to get the cool
fisheye-lens effect.

04:17.992 --> 04:22.261
Your jacked-up eyeballs
are our hip-hop
supergroup's game.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.528
I'm sorry.
Supergroup?

04:23.530 --> 04:25.597
You may play the guitar
and sing like an angel,

04:25.599 --> 04:28.100
but I'm the real musician
in the family.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.269
I'm just happy
he's including me.

04:30.271 --> 04:31.169
Like DJ Jazzy Jeff.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.571
Dude, you're not
a real musician.

04:32.573 --> 04:36.541
You can't sing or read music
or play an instrument,

04:36.543 --> 04:38.510
unlike me,
who can do all of it.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.244
Hiding in your bedroom.

04:39.246 --> 04:43.382
You've written tons
of lame chick songs,
but no one's ever heard them.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.683
I'm just...

04:44.685 --> 04:45.751
Perfecting each one.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.453
No. You're stalling
'cause you're afraid

04:48.455 --> 04:50.188
of what people
might think of you.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.090
I, on the other hand,
don't think at all.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.792
It's true.
He does not think.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.727
Just because
you like Beastie Boys

04:55.729 --> 04:57.663
doesn't mean
you can be them.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.864
They're three
awesome musicians,

04:58.866 --> 05:00.966
and you're two
clueless idiots.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.467
You're right.
We need a third.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.635
I feel like
I could say anything,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.304
and you would just do
whatever you want.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.273
She's right!
We should
hold auditions!

05:10.611 --> 05:13.078
(RAPPING)
<i> ¶ Check it. One, two</i>

05:13.080 --> 05:14.546
<i> ¶ Two, one</i>

05:14.548 --> 05:15.614
<i> ¶ Three, two, one</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:17.549
<i> ¶ One, two, three</i>

05:17.551 --> 05:19.084
<i> ¶ Three, two, one ¶</i>

05:19.086 --> 05:21.286
Ah, wait. I messed up.
Can I start over, guys?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.855
(JAZZ RIFF PLAYING)

05:24.158 --> 05:27.259
Before you say yes,
I have a list
of 200 demands.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.861
<i> ¶ My rhymes are hotter</i>
<i> than a candle's wick</i>

05:29.863 --> 05:32.331
<i> ¶ Call a doctor</i>
<i> 'cause my flow is sick</i>

<i> ¶ The ladies say</i>
<i> Rob's gonna make it</i>

05:34.101 --> 05:37.102
<i> ¶ 'cause when I rock the mike,</i>
<i> I get buck naked ¶</i>

05:37.104 --> 05:37.969
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

05:37.971 --> 05:40.972
Is there any way
Naked Rob can rap
without getting naked?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.575
Nudity, or I walk.

05:45.012 --> 05:45.811
Yeah, no, okay.
(STUTTERING)

05:45.813 --> 05:48.613
You guys, I thought I could
do this to impress Erica,
but I just... I can't.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.382
(STUTTERING)
I get wicked stage fright.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.483
You're in.
What?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.552
Dude! You look
just like Ad-Rock.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.387
The resemblance
is uncanny.

05:55.389 --> 05:56.722
Oh, my God.
It really is, bro.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.692
Does Ad-Rock
break into hives onstage?
Oh, no.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.394
The room is spinning.
I'm going down.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.429
He said yes!
The Tasty Boys are in!

06:04.431 --> 06:07.366
ADULT ADAM: <i> While my brother</i>
<i> and I had assembled</i>
<i> our new group,</i>

06:07.368 --> 06:09.701
<i> my dad had come home</i>
<i> to his old habits.</i>

06:09.703 --> 06:10.736
BEVERLY:
Oh, look at that.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.905
My creature of habit
dropped his pants
at the door.

06:13.907 --> 06:14.673
What a surprise.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.041
TOGETHER:
Damn it, I just got home!

06:16.043 --> 06:19.344
See? I knew
that was gonna be
your reaction.

06:19.346 --> 06:22.047
TOGETHER:
Stop aggravating me.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.882
TOGETHER:
Drop it already!

06:23.884 --> 06:24.716
TOGETHER: Gah!

06:24.718 --> 06:27.452
If you do just
one of the things
on my list

06:27.454 --> 06:29.788
I've been begging you
to do for ages,

06:29.790 --> 06:32.157
I'll forget
all about the kitchen.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.493
"Wear a turtleneck."
No.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.461
"Couples massage."
No.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.264
"Floss."
No one does that.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.899
"Yoga?" Never.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.667
"Picnic." pass.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.169
"Boxer shorts?"

06:44.171 --> 06:44.970
How dare you?

06:44.972 --> 06:48.373
This is the worst list
ever made.
I hate this list.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.342
Just pick one.
Fine.

06:50.344 --> 06:51.843
"Jean dungarees."

06:51.845 --> 06:53.245
I'll wear your damn
jean dungarees.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.848
ADULT ADAM: <i> For the</i>
<i> first time ever,</i>

<i> to prove to my mom</i>
<i> he could be flexible.</i>

06:59.520 --> 07:02.187
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> he could barely move.</i>

07:02.189 --> 07:02.788
I like them.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.891
Well, tell me what exactly
you like about them, huh?

07:05.893 --> 07:06.425
Be specific.

07:06.427 --> 07:10.595
Well, I like that there's
one leg for each of my legs.

07:10.597 --> 07:14.099
I love the stiff,
unforgiving fabric.

07:14.101 --> 07:14.699
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

07:14.701 --> 07:16.568
Nope! I can't
sit in them!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.236
They chafe, Bevy!
They chafe!

07:18.238 --> 07:20.605
My God,
you can't even wear
a new pair of pants

07:20.607 --> 07:21.606
for 30 seconds?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.508
Fine. I'm a creature
of habit.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.076
And you're still not
getting that new kitchen.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.746
Well, I don't need you
to give it for me to get it.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.281
I can get it
without you giving it.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.751
I don't get it.
I'm gonna build it myself.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.852
Wait!

07:33.854 --> 07:35.420
I can't move!

07:35.422 --> 07:36.288
Take them off!

ADULT ADAM: <i> While my mom</i>
<i> was on a mission,</i>

07:37.424 --> 07:42.360
<i> Barry made a precise game plan</i>
<i> on how we'd become rap stars.</i>

07:42.362 --> 07:42.828
Okay!

07:42.830 --> 07:47.799
First up, we need a fly style
to set us apart from the pack.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.401
Run-DMC has Adidas.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.169
Public Enemy
wears clocks.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.137
The Fat Boys
have obesity.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.640
I got it! We each
dress like a Fraggle.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.310
You be Boober.
Geoff is Wembley.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.177
I'll be a Doozer.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.446
No. A Gorg.
No! Doozer!

08:01.448 --> 08:03.081
You're mispronouncing
"dork" and "loser."

08:03.083 --> 08:04.382
Next.
Oh, I know.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.818
What if we dress
like things that
Erica likes?

08:06.820 --> 08:07.919
I could go
into her room,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.955
poke around,
see what makes her tick.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.090
No, no.
That's weird.

08:12.092 --> 08:12.724
You're both weird.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.760
I know exactly the style
we're gonna rock.

08:17.364 --> 08:18.830
Boom!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.365
Now, this is a look.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.702
But aren't we just
dressed exactly like
Beastie Boys?

08:23.971 --> 08:24.603
No.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.972
Mike D
wears Volkswagen.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.841
I'm wearing
Station Wagon.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.910
MCA wears
a leather jacket.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.678
Yours is pleather.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.181
Ad-Rock wears
a Stuyvesant
Phys-ed shirt.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.883
Yours is from
Jenkintown Elementary.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.651
Nice.
Super-different.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.219
Now that we're
rocking our look,

08:41.221 --> 08:43.121
there's only
one thing left.

08:43.123 --> 08:43.588
Entourage?

08:43.590 --> 08:45.123
You can massage
our shoulders,

08:45.125 --> 08:46.424
polish our gold,
lie to our wives,

08:46.426 --> 08:49.761
and romance
second-tier groupies
not hot enough for us.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.462
We're in.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.997
Picking up the crumbs!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.100
<i> And even though the Tasty Boys</i>
<i> didn't have any actual songs,</i>

08:55.102 --> 08:58.770
<i> the next logical step</i>
<i> was to shoot an album cover.</i>

08:58.772 --> 09:01.406
ERICA: Hey.
It's the Pasty Boys.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.407
What are you
wannabes doing?

09:02.409 --> 09:04.075
Just locking down
our album cover.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.810
Without writing
any songs?

09:05.812 --> 09:08.580
Songs.
We got that covered.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.281
Actually, she's right.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.416
We haven't, like,
written anything.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.386
Hello? Ever hear
of Eric B. & Rakim?

09:14.388 --> 09:15.320
We're just like them!

09:15.322 --> 09:17.722
We don't write.
We feel the beat,

09:17.724 --> 09:19.925
let it flow, freestyle.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.328
Wait. Like
make it up as we go?
That seems hard.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.195
Is it?

Boom!
Oh! Oh!

09:31.104 --> 09:33.872
Whoo!
He just rhymed
'Barry' with 'scary'

09:33.874 --> 09:36.641
All you're gonna do
is embarrass yourselves.

09:36.643 --> 09:39.044
Erica, we're not like you.

09:39.046 --> 09:39.945
We don't live in fear.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.913
Okay. You're delusional.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.082
You can't have
an album without songs.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.317
And you can't be superstars

09:45.319 --> 09:47.586
without ever
performing a concert.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.954
She's right.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.922
We need a gig.
Huge one!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.223
Okay, not what I meant.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.224
Entourage...

09:53.226 --> 09:54.492
You run west.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.093
You run east.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.663
Spread the word
that the Tasty Boys
are coming.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.599
All right.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.701

<i> the entire kitchen.</i>

10:11.912 --> 10:12.577
What are you doing?

10:12.579 --> 10:16.247
Oh, since you won't
build my dream kitchen,
I'm gonna build it myself.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.816
You were serious
about that?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.718
You call a hammer
a 'poundy thingy.'

10:19.720 --> 10:20.885
Well, now I don't
need your help,

10:20.887 --> 10:24.255
because now I have
someone on my side
who loves change.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.158
Bob Vila from
<i> This Old House.</i>
Ha!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.593
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That's right. In the '80s,</i>

10:28.595 --> 10:32.664
<i> Bob Vila was</i>

10:32.666 --> 10:34.399
Fine. Go ahead.
(DRILL WHIRRING)

10:34.401 --> 10:37.068
But I'm not gonna
clean up your mess.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.136
Shows what you know!

10:38.138 --> 10:41.840
With Bob Vila on my side,
I can build anything!

10:41.842 --> 10:44.576

10:49.082 --> 10:50.582
What the hell happened?

10:50.584 --> 10:52.083
I wrecked the kitchen.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.119
Now I have
no place to cook.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.621
We're gonna have
to order italian takeout,

10:56.623 --> 10:57.555
like a bunch of hobos.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.457
That Bob Vila
is a real piece of work.

10:59.459 --> 11:03.662
Building us up,
making us think
we could lay tile.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.562
We can't lay tile.

11:04.564 --> 11:08.033
I'll call Bill,
and we'll fix this.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.536
Oh, you would
do that for me?

11:11.538 --> 11:14.906
Oh, thank you, honey.
You're the best.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.808

11:18.111 --> 11:19.678
Where did all the tears go?
What's happening?

11:19.680 --> 11:24.315
What's happening is,
I ruined the kitchen
on purpose.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.484
No. You wouldn't.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.118
I mean, you would.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.255
I know he'll be happier
when it's all said and done.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.490
I mean, sometimes
creatures of habit

11:32.492 --> 11:36.294

bit of nudging.

11:42.502 --> 11:46.438
Oh, my God!
You're playing
the pep rally?

11:46.440 --> 11:47.439
This is so out of hand.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.940
No, the Tasty Boys
are the real deal.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.911
I heard after the pep rally,
they're playing Live Aid.

11:52.913 --> 11:53.578
I heard Capitol Records

11:53.580 --> 11:55.380
gave them each a Porsche
as a signing bonus.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.282
Plus, they're
bonkers hot.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.950
No. None of that is true.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.285
You're not true.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.687
Oh, my God,
here they come!

12:07.894 --> 12:10.695
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, miss.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.463
This is a VIP area.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.630
It's okay.
She's a groupie.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.333
I am not...
just let me through.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.367
This is crazy.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.669
Why does everyone
think you guys

12:17.671 --> 12:20.071
are an actual group
with a record deal?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.005
'Cause we told them!

12:21.007 --> 12:23.708
Isn't that genius?
It's called hype.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.110
No, it's called lying.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.745
Oh. I see what this is.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.814
You're just mad
'cause we're getting
all the attention.

12:29.816 --> 12:32.317
Kind of seems like
someone's jealous.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.985
Oh, my God,
you are insane.

12:33.987 --> 12:36.721
I'm annoyed.
I'm not jealous.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.556
I'm so jealous!

12:38.558 --> 12:39.524
Well, you should be.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.827
I heard
they're teaming up
with Eric B. & Rakim

12:42.829 --> 12:43.661
for their next record.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.697
What? The hype
has reached you, too?

12:45.699 --> 12:49.000
Who told you?
I heard it from
Naked Rob.

12:49.002 --> 12:49.601
Dear God.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.870
I've been
working on my music
my whole life,

12:51.872 --> 12:55.039
and just watch...
Those idiots are
gonna get famous.

12:55.041 --> 12:57.909
Honey, just focus
on your own music.

12:57.911 --> 12:58.877
That's what matters.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.147
Now come on.
Show me what you got.

13:02.149 --> 13:06.184
I'd love to, but I have
a scratchy throat.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.486
And lucky ate my music.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.861
Play me something.

13:17.764 --> 13:18.463
Okay.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.798
Now, you need
to keep in mind

13:19.800 --> 13:23.268
that these songs are still
a work in progress.
Gotcha.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.869
And the lyrics
kind of suck.
Okay.

13:24.871 --> 13:28.540
And I hate
the way I sound.
Maybe no intro.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.280
I'm just not ready.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.381
Got to go.
Bye-bye.

I can't wait to see
your new kitchen.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.388
Oh, the boys have been
working hard all weekend.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.222
How's it looking, bill?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.757
I called in
a bunch of favors.

13:45.759 --> 13:47.992
Anything for my
best bud's lady.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.727

I'm a good reader of people,
and you don't seem pleased.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.376
You did this
just to spite me.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.779
Because you
manipulated me.

14:07.781 --> 14:08.646
You think I don't know

14:08.648 --> 14:10.281
that you wrecked
the kitchen on purpose?

14:10.283 --> 14:13.685
Fine. You want
to play it that way?

14:15.689 --> 14:18.990
Stop it! That's liquid gold
you're throwing away!

14:18.992 --> 14:20.391
So, we're gonna go now.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.159
No, no.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.460
You helped him.
Now you're gonna help me.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.697
No, I'd like to...
I'm not gonna do this...
BEVERLY: No.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.232
Pour it out, Bill!
No.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.499
No, I'm not...
pour it out.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.534
Go. Pour it out.
No.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.135
I'm not gonna pour it out.
Do it.
Yes, you are.

No, no!

I don't know.

manipulated me.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.555

how hard it is

14:51.825 --> 14:54.626

you could compromise,

16:09.569 --> 16:13.037
<i> my dad finally decided</i>
<i> to try a few new things.</i>

16:13.039 --> 16:16.574
Hey! Come on down
and cop a squat.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
Let's eat without
back support.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.111
What is this?
What are you doing?

16:20.113 --> 16:21.980
I'm just trying out
all the new things
you wanted.

16:21.982 --> 16:26.017
We got a picnic,
a long-neck shirt thingy.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.619
And I'm sitting,
which counts as yoga.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.322
Stop. Get up.
I can't do that.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.790
Just get up.
I can't.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.760
Just stand up like
a normal human being.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.096
Come on.
Ow. I'll try.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.498
(BOTH GROANING)

16:43.136 --> 16:45.570
Ow.
Damn it, that's it.

16:45.572 --> 16:46.738
I'm a floor person now.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.438
Are you crazy?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.874
Why would you
sit on the floor?

16:49.876 --> 16:50.408
(SIGHS)

16:50.410 --> 16:53.878
Because I felt bad
about what happened.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.179
It's all right.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.448
I'll... I'll be fine
without a new kitchen.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.916
You've got
to understand...

16:58.918 --> 17:02.253
just because I don't
like things to change

17:02.255 --> 17:04.288
doesn't mean you
don't matter to me.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.025
I never thought
I'd be happy.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.161
But you built
this life for us,

17:10.163 --> 17:13.097
and I love it
just the way it is.

17:13.199 --> 17:13.831
Ah, Mur.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.000
But if it means
that much to you,

17:16.002 --> 17:17.935
maybe I can change
the kitchen.

17:17.937 --> 17:18.603
I'll get the tools!

17:18.605 --> 17:20.471
And the little
poundy thingy!

17:20.473 --> 17:23.474
Wait! Don't leave me
down here!

17:23.476 --> 17:24.509
(ALL CHANTING)
Tasty boys! Tasty boys!

17:24.511 --> 17:26.744
ADULT ADAM: <i> We were</i>
<i> at minute 10 of stalling,</i>

17:26.746 --> 17:28.746
<i> and the crowd</i>
<i> wasn't giving up.</i>

17:28.748 --> 17:30.114
Why won't they
stop chanting?

17:30.116 --> 17:33.951
Making the fans wait
is a classic hype move.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.119
The hype has backfired!

17:35.121 --> 17:36.254
What's the
holdup, guys?

17:36.256 --> 17:39.057
The monster you created
is waiting to eat you alive.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.093
I can't do this.
Erica, look away!

17:43.029 --> 17:45.063
Geoff, no!

17:47.434 --> 17:49.400
Man, he's, like,
really fast.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.236
Our supergroup
is falling apart.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.271
What do we do?

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
I don't know!

17:55.108 --> 17:55.773
Erica was right.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.775
I should have just
kept my stupid dreams
to myself

17:57.777 --> 18:00.845
and stayed in my room
so no one would ever
chant my name.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.815
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> Erica realized something.</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:05.850
No.
<i> As clueless as Barry was,</i>

18:05.852 --> 18:08.352
<i> he was still smart</i>
<i> to put himself out there.</i>

18:08.354 --> 18:10.955
Everyone's chanting
your name.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.390
You can't just
give that up now.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.326
We have no music.
We got nothing.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.061
You still got
Beastie Boys.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.763
But we lost
our Ad-Rock.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.530
Well, you've got me.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.265
ADULT ADAM: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i> forming a rap supergroup</i>

18:21.267 --> 18:24.068
<i> is, like, way harder</i>
<i> than it looks,</i>

18:24.070 --> 18:24.836
<i> which is why we decided</i>

18:24.838 --> 18:27.038
<i> to leave it to the</i>
<i> people who did it best.</i>

It's beautiful.

How about a new coke

<i> ...because trying</i>

Want to hear it?
So, what?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.474
You spent all weekend
writing a rap,

20:43.476 --> 20:44.842
and now you're trying
to make me think

20:44.844 --> 20:46.277
that you're making
it up on the spot?

20:46.279 --> 20:48.246
No. It's off the top
of my head.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.247
Check it.
No, no, no, no.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.683

I pick the topic.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.187
Bicycles.
Got it.
