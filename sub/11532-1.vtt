So I left it at home.

12:30.057 --> 12:32.857
Can I go to my mom?

23:32.200 --> 23:36.200
The fuck!

23:52.720 --> 23:56.720
"I love you ..."

24:35.080 --> 24:37.600
So what? Today we're not talking
me more?

24:37.800 --> 24:41.800
No.

24:42.800 --> 24:46.800
Sam, I know you can hear me! Stop it.
Get up, get ready, and pressure.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.880
Yesterday it felt like when the guy
asked me what I would do with pleasure.

24:51.080 --> 24:55.040
Okay, I wash my hands of you, Sam.

24:55.240 --> 24:59.240
I am really disappointed.

25:29.240 --> 25:33.240
Come!

27:47.040 --> 27:48.320
What are you looking at?

27:48.520 --> 27:50.520
You.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.720
So beautiful.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.200
Not.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.400
I think instead it's you.
What do you think you are beautiful?

28:06.680 --> 28:07.760
No?

28:07.960 --> 28:10.280
I think so.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.080
Do you want to wear makeup?

28:12.280 --> 28:14.120
Okay.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.160
Have you wearing?

28:16.360 --> 28:17.200
No.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.200
Not?

28:19.400 --> 28:21.240
Your mother is not never anointed?

28:21.440 --> 28:25.440
I did not live with him.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.200
Would you like some lipstick too?

28:31.400 --> 28:32.440
Okay.

28:32.640 --> 28:36.640
Do this ...

28:36.920 --> 28:40.920
Very good will.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.920
Is it true? Then we can go.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.440
The other is that your daughter?

30:57.760 --> 30:59.560
What's the problem? I just asked.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.760
How's the other girl?

31:04.920 --> 31:07.440
This has nothing to do with here.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.360
- Why?
- Just because.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.520
Just asking ...

31:10.720 --> 31:12.280
Fucking astray.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.400
It is not true.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.440
But yes.

31:14.640 --> 31:18.080
Aileron fucking, screw,
to avoid getting to.

31:18.280 --> 31:22.280
All I ask, tell them that
love him, but this is incapable of.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.200
This is not true.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.520
Him we have ...

31:27.720 --> 31:28.960
- That's fucked up ...
- ... What's his name?

31:29.160 --> 31:30.440
A fucked up, okay?

31:30.640 --> 31:32.560
Why? Why? Why?

31:32.760 --> 31:36.760
- What do you want me to say?
- Because he's not fucking you, you know?

31:54.760 --> 31:58.760
I'm scared.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.880
I know.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.680
Yes, only of you.

32:06.880 --> 32:10.880
From me?

32:53.080 --> 32:57.080
Kiss me once more.

33:00.584 --> 33:02.984
It's so beautiful.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.880
Today I visit my mother.

33:29.080 --> 33:29.920
Yes?

33:30.120 --> 33:34.120
Yes.

33:57.440 --> 33:59.880
Please empty your pockets?

34:00.080 --> 34:01.680
Certain that the same man?

34:01.880 --> 34:04.360
Watching you, I know that.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.240
- Are you sure?
- Szemtelenkedsz?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.880
No, not at all. You know,
I mean. I did not do anything.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.719
You put something in your pocket.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.360
I swear I did not do anything.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.840
Turn out or call the police,
And I will bring.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.120
I do not care ...
I did not do anything.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.560
- It was you, I saw you.
- You can not do anything.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.520
- Can you tell me your name?
- I do not.

34:24.268 --> 34:28.027
- We can do another way, we speak
the cops. - Then what you gonna do?

34:28.148 --> 34:29.868
Arrested for shoplifting.

34:29.947 --> 34:33.706
Not move when they come out ...
Up to 20 minutes obstruct.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.480
I do not think so.

34:35.679 --> 34:37.000
- How old are you?
- 14

34:37.199 --> 34:38.120
- It is not true.
- Yes, many.

34:38.706 --> 34:42.388
- No, you look much older.
- I do not. - How old are you, girl?

34:42.545 --> 34:45.069
- 11
- And it's not supposed to be in school?

34:45.148 --> 34:48.469
- Changes schools, and there are no
We found a new one. - I see.

34:48.547 --> 34:52.268
- Where are your parents?
- I do not live with them. - No?

34:53.828 --> 34:56.908
- Who is this girl? - Friendly.
- He's my friend.

34:57.027 --> 35:02.948
- It's not nice to steal a little girl immediately.
- That's not a nice thing you are doing.

35:03.029 --> 35:05.869
- It's not nice to splash in me.
- Rummage through your pockets.

35:06.109 --> 35:09.068
- Are you police?
- It does not matter.

35:09.147 --> 35:12.669
- No, a security guard. Wanted to get into
cop, huh? - I'm calling the police.

35:12.749 --> 35:17.909
I bet that occurred
but failed badly failed

35:17.989 --> 35:20.790
- Melףzik so fucking drugstore.
- I know the kind of ...

35:20.869 --> 35:24.831
- Are you cursed? - Yes!
- Stand up to בtkutathassalak?

35:25.069 --> 35:27.629
- You would not mind if we search your pocket?
- Inquires only, who cares.

35:28.269 --> 35:31.430
- It's beautiful. Point your color!
- Yes, it is.

35:31.700 --> 35:33.399
As the tongue is ... blue.

35:33.790 --> 35:37.390
May I? Yes, these
What about Hassels.

35:37.469 --> 35:40.960
- He admitted the theft. - So what?
What are you going to do with me?

35:41.160 --> 35:43.120
Coming out of the police and arrested.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.400
Why? Why? Robbery?
Come on, you can do it.

35:45.600 --> 35:47.800
Please tell me your real name?

35:47.871 --> 35:51.399
- Carol. - I know her first name.
- Vorderman. - In his first name?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.440
- Carol.
- Lauren.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.750
- Lauren? - Yes, Lauren.
- Laurel Verderman or Vorderman?

35:55.872 --> 35:58.751
- Lauren.
- Know the last name?

35:59.591 --> 36:02.511
- What's your name, honey?
- Lucy Manvers.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.240
Let go of me, you bitch!

36:12.440 --> 36:13.280
Give me a break!

36:13.480 --> 36:15.040
Hey! Calm down! Calm down!

36:15.240 --> 36:19.080
Let go of me!

36:19.280 --> 36:20.480
Lauren, calm down.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.080
You're an idiot! Let go of me! Listen ...

36:22.280 --> 36:25.280
Get off me, now!

36:25.480 --> 36:29.480
Take it easy.

37:02.083 --> 37:04.563
If you accept a good advice,
Do not hang out with him a lot,

37:04.763 --> 37:06.208
or every day will be the guest
in this car.

37:06.408 --> 37:07.288
This is a very malicious ...

37:07.488 --> 37:08.488
Now we go back.

37:08.688 --> 37:09.088
How do you say?

37:09.288 --> 37:11.688
- I find it very malicious.
- Then what?

37:11.888 --> 37:14.728
"You should not hang out with him,
because da da da ... "

37:14.928 --> 37:16.888
I do not think he knows anything,
Lawrence police public.

37:17.088 --> 37:20.328
- To truly understand the essence.
- Really, Lauren?

37:20.528 --> 37:24.128
- You can only do this.
- A real comedian. Laugh.

37:24.328 --> 37:27.568
- Laugh. - What about girls
what you planned for Christmas?

37:27.768 --> 37:30.008
We get drunk fucking, dude.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.848
- Intelligent, huh?
- I can not wait.

37:33.048 --> 37:36.248
So, since you made the home
Christmas?

37:36.448 --> 37:38.648
How to cook a damn shit lunch.

37:38.848 --> 37:39.488
I see.

37:39.688 --> 37:42.448
Odacsesznek three boxes.
's About it.

37:42.648 --> 37:44.648
What do you want, Cooper cop?

37:44.848 --> 37:47.528
Not to see Lauren
at least a week.

37:47.728 --> 37:50.008
And you're Lucy?
You are what you planned?

37:50.208 --> 37:51.408
I do not know.

37:51.608 --> 37:52.648
You do not know?

37:52.848 --> 37:55.408
I look forward to Lucy?

37:55.608 --> 37:56.288
Sort of.

37:56.488 --> 37:57.328
Something like that?

37:57.528 --> 38:00.208
- How to create Santa's gift.
- Oh, God.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.048
I do not know.

38:02.248 --> 38:05.448
# St. Nicholas came ... #

38:05.648 --> 38:06.328
Okay, Lauren ...

38:06.528 --> 38:10.528
# The city. Hu hתתתתת! #

38:13.328 --> 38:14.448
What is it?

38:14.648 --> 38:15.528
Can we go?

38:15.728 --> 38:19.048
We have your permission? If it is not,
then come the fuck are you, man.

38:19.248 --> 38:20.568
I have a permit.
Come on, Lauren.

38:20.768 --> 38:22.608
- Show the license.
- Let me.

38:22.808 --> 38:24.968
This did not work without permission!

38:25.168 --> 38:26.928
Relax, take it easy.

38:27.128 --> 38:28.368
Come on, girls. Take it easy.

38:28.568 --> 38:30.168
Take it easy.

38:30.368 --> 38:31.288
Okay. All right, guys?

38:31.488 --> 38:35.488
We continue straight.
To Lauren.

38:38.368 --> 38:41.608
I will ask Lee to arrange it, okay?

38:41.808 --> 38:43.768
Just sit down here.

38:43.968 --> 38:46.488
- Should I go out?
- All right, see you later.

38:46.688 --> 38:49.248
A little paperwork

38:49.448 --> 38:51.288
just the usual.

38:51.488 --> 38:53.808
Read it and you should just write in below.

38:54.008 --> 38:56.768
And if even this evening, even you sign-G71 ...

38:56.968 --> 38:59.248
I do not want to see you again, okay?
Merry Christmas, you guys.

38:59.448 --> 39:03.448
Happy Christmas.
Take it easy, buddy. Hey.

39:11.528 --> 39:15.528
What is it, girls?

39:16.488 --> 39:19.248
Why were the police?

39:19.448 --> 39:23.128
Lauren, why the police were brought in?

39:23.328 --> 39:27.328
Okay, Lucy, why are the police
brought home to you?

39:27.848 --> 39:30.208
We went to the mall.

39:30.408 --> 39:33.208
What did you do there?

39:33.408 --> 39:35.368
Then came the police.

39:35.568 --> 39:39.568
Why go out?

39:40.168 --> 39:43.088
Because ...

39:43.288 --> 39:46.648
Lauren without paying
things in it,

39:46.848 --> 39:51.688
- And walked out of the store with them.
- Lauren, why are you kidding me?

39:51.888 --> 39:55.888
What do you play? Why are you looking at air?
Why can not you just answer?

39:56.808 --> 40:00.808
You know what irresponsibility?

40:03.328 --> 40:07.328
I swear to God, Lauren,
that you're not normal.

40:19.728 --> 40:22.648
This is not funny.
It's not funny.

40:22.848 --> 40:24.728
Why did not you say a word of what?

40:24.928 --> 40:27.848
- Your party should have to hold him?
- Yes. Why did not you get out?

40:28.048 --> 40:29.268
I can not do anything.

40:29.480 --> 40:32.922
My rose, faszfejnek called
you told me I'm an idiot ...

40:33.088 --> 40:35.487
- Somewhat right. Come on ...
- Why did not you say anything?

40:35.488 --> 40:38.207
You brought back the cops ...
You were caught stealing ...

40:38.260 --> 40:40.800
- You are not an Einstein. So?
- The little girl did not do anything.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.687
I stole it, he does not, and can not understand why
keeps saying that it does not hang with me.

40:46.688 --> 40:48.364
Child or adult, or?
You always told me:

40:48.564 --> 40:50.568
"Do not Treat you like them.
I'm not a child. "

40:50.768 --> 40:52.888
- Yes, because obviously ...
- As a child ...

40:53.088 --> 40:55.328
I do not see why not
You stood up for me!

40:55.528 --> 40:59.528
Leave me to speak,
or continue the equivocation?

40:59.808 --> 41:03.368
It is not clear why we should stand up for you,
When reaching for shoplifting,

41:03.568 --> 41:06.408
and twisting him into trouble.
Still, that can I?

41:06.608 --> 41:09.928
Would not it make sense, does not it?
Did you dress her for yourself, Lauren.

41:10.128 --> 41:14.128
You also need to eat.
That's it.

41:16.768 --> 41:20.768
Hi ... you.

41:58.284 --> 42:00.764
- Are you all right?
- Fuck you.

42:00.883 --> 42:03.165
- Fuck off you.
- Get out.

42:03.803 --> 42:07.003
- What was I supposed to do?
Stand up next to you? - I do not care.

42:07.083 --> 42:10.244
I am currently Cutlets from Michael.

42:11.003 --> 42:13.524
- Not a big heart, you know it.
- No?

42:13.608 --> 42:15.447
- Come down, watch a movie.
- I do not want to!

42:15.448 --> 42:17.087
- Oh, come on.
- I do not ...

42:17.204 --> 42:21.684
- Come on. - Fuck off! - Should I go on?
- I do not want to! - Put this on.

42:21.805 --> 42:25.044
I'm going down, I put a cup of tea.
You get two minutes.

42:26.365 --> 42:28.806
- You also get to.
- Shut up.

42:28.926 --> 42:32.525
- Then you come down?
- Come on, Ben. - All right.

44:03.048 --> 44:05.408
Move over.

44:05.608 --> 44:08.608
Come on Lucy. Come on, sit down.
Look at us.

44:08.808 --> 44:11.008
It seems insane.

44:11.208 --> 44:15.208
French film look.

44:59.928 --> 45:02.168
Okay, guys, I think,
time for bed.

45:02.368 --> 45:04.448
It's okay, Michael.
I told him to stay up.

45:04.648 --> 45:06.848
A little late. I think everyone
I should be in bed.

45:07.048 --> 45:09.008
Yes, but if I said okay,
okay then, right?

45:09.208 --> 45:11.568
We strongly believe that Lucy ...
Would you like to have sex?

45:11.768 --> 45:12.448
Yes, I do.

45:12.648 --> 45:14.208
Yes? You can get a lot.

45:14.408 --> 45:18.928
- As if at least the "Texas
Lבncf�rיszes "was looking at. - Come on, Lucy.

45:19.128 --> 45:19.688
Do not be called into question ...

45:19.888 --> 45:21.168
You do not poיnkodok.

45:21.368 --> 45:23.688
Needless to jokes, man.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.648
Fuck.

45:25.848 --> 45:26.888
What is it?

45:27.088 --> 45:28.288
Clean joke.

45:28.488 --> 45:29.928
Evening 'Kevin.
It's all good?

45:30.128 --> 45:33.128
Okay.

46:14.888 --> 46:16.208
Shh!

46:16.408 --> 46:19.248
Lauren!

47:10.615 --> 47:13.096
- In the morning.
- Fuck off.

55:29.768 --> 55:31.088
Are you okay?

55:31.288 --> 55:34.808
Yes.

55:35.008 --> 55:39.008
I made you some toast
it's milk, if you want.

55:42.328 --> 55:45.368
Okay.

55:45.568 --> 55:46.248
Thank you.

55:46.448 --> 55:50.448
Eat.

55:52.008 --> 55:56.008
I was worried about you.

56:00.448 --> 56:02.128
Good?

56:02.328 --> 56:06.328
Yes.

Do you believe in God?

56:30.068 --> 56:32.030
Yes.

56:32.230 --> 56:36.230
Sometimes it's not easy, but yes,

56:42.110 --> 56:46.110
You know him?
An Indian god Krishna.

56:47.070 --> 56:51.070
Did you learn about the different religions
in school, right?

56:52.910 --> 56:54.710
Only Christianity to know.

56:54.910 --> 56:56.910
All I?

56:57.110 --> 56:59.510
Jesus?

56:59.710 --> 57:03.710
Jesus is great.

57:04.830 --> 57:06.790
Are you married?

57:06.990 --> 57:08.630
No, I'm not.

57:08.830 --> 57:10.390
Is your partner?

57:10.590 --> 57:13.910
"Partner"?
Yes, I have a boyfriend.

57:15.955 --> 57:18.596
We look at the range.

57:34.910 --> 57:38.630
Okay, it was ticklish?

57:43.030 --> 57:45.870
Okay, according to the size of 33.

57:46.070 --> 57:48.710
Okay, you can remove.
So, what are you looking for?

57:48.910 --> 57:50.230
Something kimenץset.

Trainers do you want?

57:52.910 --> 57:55.230

57:55.430 --> 57:58.430
Shiny.
I know one that blinks, little lady.

57:58.630 --> 58:00.510
I really do!

58:00.710 --> 58:02.870
And no lace.

58:03.070 --> 58:04.910
But it's up to you. Like it?

58:05.110 --> 58:08.590
Pצrצgj it a bit.
Move your fingers.

58:08.790 --> 58:10.590
They look really good.

58:10.790 --> 58:14.790
If I could have colored wigs,
What kind do you want?

58:15.110 --> 58:16.470
Let's just say they are?

58:16.670 --> 58:18.270
Probably blond.

58:18.470 --> 58:21.470
Szץkיbץl blonde?

58:27.590 --> 58:29.350
I like it because it goes on ...

58:29.550 --> 58:33.550
The pink goes in your shoe.

58:33.790 --> 58:35.870
Would you like to stay in it?

58:36.070 --> 58:37.510
Okay, let me take off the label.

58:37.710 --> 58:38.710
Can I get an invoice?

58:46.030 --> 58:49.750
Do you want tea or coffee?

58:49.950 --> 58:54.030
- Are you okay?
- Yes, hi.

58:54.230 --> 58:57.750

59:05.230 --> 59:05.350
Okay ...

59:05.550 --> 59:07.110
Minimum of five minutes.

Place your szerzemיnyeidet well.
Jackie Show me what you bought.

59:23.110 --> 59:27.110
Right.

59:28.990 --> 59:32.310
What about your family, Lucy?
They contacted you?

59:32.510 --> 59:36.510
No.

59:44.510 --> 59:47.710
Dental examinations have you been?

59:47.910 --> 59:51.550
I think not.

59:51.750 --> 59:55.750
Okay ...

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.870
We are trying to get into
a Catholic school,

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.070
if we find one nearby.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.830
Here we describe, escaped, Lucy.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:22.030
What is this all about?

01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:48.470
I'm sorry I have not been here for a while, the
director of the office is not my gas money.

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:52.670
But now it's envelope,
many times I will be here, okay?

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:57.830
You need to call if anything
need, right?

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:05.470
Right.

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:13.070
Okay, I need a date
fel�lvizsgבlatodhoz solution for this.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:17.270
Do you think I ask
How can I live with my mom?

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:23.430
This is something ... What you will
review we can talk.

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.790
I'll be there, and maybe Vicky ...

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:32.830
Here you go, the tea livestock.

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.310
It is very nice.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.670
You and I have a glass of milk
Lucy, right?

01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:41.750
I'll let you talk to
but if you need me, sikםtsatok.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.030
Okay.

01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:47.070
So to test, I'll be there,

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.270
as a senior social worker,
Vicky and will be there as well.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:57.030
They will talk together.

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.950
But I do not know about him?

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.950
No.

01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:09.150
Not a letter or anything?

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:46.470
Are you okay?

01:02:57.889 --> 01:03:00.169
- Hide!
- No, you hide!

01:03:05.691 --> 01:03:07.491
Hide.

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.609
Smile.

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:39.390
Lauren?

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:43.590
I am ... Lucy.

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:35.110
I'm all right, Lucy.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:39.310
You do not have to worry about me.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.630
Hey ...

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:29.670
Hey, wake up.

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:32.110
- What was that all about?
- ... What ...?

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:34.190
You know what it is.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:35.750
What are you doing?

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.230
I came to talk.

01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:38.750
It would not be worth tomorrow?

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:41.990
No, I'm supposed to talk about, is not it?

01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:46.190
Ben, what are you doing?

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:50.620
- Do you have?
- Yes.

01:07:51.019 --> 01:07:53.019
- What?
- Yes!

01:07:53.139 --> 01:07:55.538
Idefordulnבl?

01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:01.070
Lauren, I need to see your face.
Look at me.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.750
It's so beautiful, you know?

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:12.750
- You do not know how, right?
- ... I do not ...

01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:20.381
No, Ben.

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.941
Ben, please.

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:33.630
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:39.870
Lucy is undoubtedly a short time
staying with us

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:43.029
it is difficult to form a complete picture.

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:46.390
But this is the first
Placing children at home,

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:49.630
One of which is the inclusion
hardest test.

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.430
So far there has been little continuity.

01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:53.510
Vulnerable due to age,

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.310
and we have policies, rules
to be set up.

01:09:56.510 --> 01:10:00.510
Lucy and I think in order for me
This is the primary goal and priority.

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:03.070
I think it would be a ...
Another very important thing is,

01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:06.910
the school, which I think
misses.

01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:10.590
Or, maybe you can talk to Lucy
week with a counselor,

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:14.670
or gyermekpszicholףgussal,
if it fits in the kצltsיgvetיs�nkbe.

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:19.184
Lucy spent together with you some time,
and for me, it's one thing sz�rץdצtt,

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:23.104
you can try based on
vulnerable due to age,

01:10:23.225 --> 01:10:27.945
therefore, the unauthorized departure ...
I think one of the children did not

01:10:28.025 --> 01:10:30.345
appropriate, he is
of particular concern.

01:10:30.424 --> 01:10:32.506
I mean, as we discussed together,
but you may need ...

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:36.070
more ... conversations with
together, and ...

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:39.550
felבllםthatnיk for slightly
kצvethetץbb guidelines.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.710
Would you like to say something, Lucy?

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:46.590
Anything that is not clear, or amine
You would like to re-בtmennיnk?

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.790
For now have this capability.

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:57.870
I do not understand why I can not live
my mom.

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:02.590
Unfortunately, at the moment,

01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.790
Only the court can decide about it.

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:53.990
Which ghost train?
Both of ...

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:58.190
- The color was different.
- Ezekiel is not good?

01:14:15.829 --> 01:14:19.829
Hey.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:56.029
Here, juice.

01:15:37.509 --> 01:15:38.589
I miss you.

01:15:38.789 --> 01:15:40.749
You can.

01:15:40.949 --> 01:15:41.749
Yes?

01:15:59.469 --> 01:16:03.469
Here you are.

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:05.549
That you know who?

01:16:05.749 --> 01:16:09.749
You!

01:16:11.013 --> 01:16:15.013
The little cocky.

01:16:18.053 --> 01:16:21.653
Between five and six in the evening.

01:16:21.853 --> 01:16:25.853
Then you were born.

01:16:26.053 --> 01:16:30.053
A little something ...

01:16:31.773 --> 01:16:35.173
The head was lying in ...

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:39.373
The tiny lבbacskבd it hung.

01:16:43.093 --> 01:16:47.093
You know, you did not give it to anybody there?

01:16:47.613 --> 01:16:51.613
Are leejtenיnek.

01:16:53.933 --> 01:16:57.933
This treasure.

01:17:04.213 --> 01:17:08.213
Do you know what your mom said,
when we met?

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:15.333
That:
"Have we met?"

01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:19.533
Pretty corny ...

01:17:19.733 --> 01:17:23.213
But I meant it.

01:17:23.413 --> 01:17:27.413
We were not ready for you.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.519
Finally, we convinced ourselves
they both want ...

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.920
And so it was ... okay.

01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:01.653
You can ... He wanted to be the mom.

01:18:02.293 --> 01:18:06.093
A mother, but I just ...

01:18:06.293 --> 01:18:10.293
He was not in it.

01:18:11.133 --> 01:18:15.133
Beloved, do you know?
I love you, he loved you.

01:18:20.893 --> 01:18:24.893
Something is just missing.

01:18:31.053 --> 01:18:34.253
The fast life flies away, Lucy.

01:18:34.453 --> 01:18:38.453
Do you think the world
All time is yours.

01:18:39.893 --> 01:18:43.893
Then it was over.

01:18:49.013 --> 01:18:53.013
Forever haunted by the error.

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:17.053
"The people living half way mark,

01:20:17.253 --> 01:20:21.253
I got a great darkening woods,

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:25.533
because you can not find the true path. "

01:21:57.173 --> 01:21:59.173

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.453
Amen.

01:22:00.653 --> 01:22:04.653
Amen.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:16.173
Come quickly.
Come on, Lucy!

01:22:16.373 --> 01:22:20.373
Come on.

01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:35.413
Lauren?

01:22:35.613 --> 01:22:38.013
Yes.

01:22:38.213 --> 01:22:40.853
I love you.

01:22:41.053 --> 01:22:45.053
Yes?

01:22:45.853 --> 01:22:49.853
I love you too.

01:23:08.213 --> 01:23:12.213
Hey!

01:23:12.853 --> 01:23:16.853
Hear!

01:24:11.653 --> 01:24:15.653
Please take a joke.

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:24.013
What will happen if you crossed
a skeleton and a detective?

01:24:26.533 --> 01:24:30.533
Sherlock Bones.

01:24:53.893 --> 01:24:57.893
# Dreams burnt out forever

01:25:02.133 --> 01:25:06.053
# Lying still in a chair rogyva

01:25:06.253 --> 01:25:10.253
# Wondering why such a 'clean the room,

# I can not get up,

# Turns off the lights
Turn off the light

01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:31.293
# The girl with whom he came

# I can not remember the name

01:25:38.813 --> 01:25:42.813
# Do not matter anymore

01:25:43.573 --> 01:25:47.213
# The shoes were still on it,

# Dreams burnt out forever. #

01:26:15.933 --> 01:26:19.933
One, two, one, two, three, four!

01:26:54.693 --> 01:26:58.493
Guess who's next?
Who is next?

01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:01.093
Girls, girls, just relax.

01:27:01.293 --> 01:27:02.559
Why are you burned?

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:06.373
What menץzצl?
You're ruining others' fun.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.420
- Shut up!
- Bohףckodsz. Why do not you go upstairs?

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.103
Take the small gצncצdet,
then go up the stairs.

01:27:12.813 --> 01:27:15.852
Who might be asking,
"Lauren ass kicked,

01:27:15.853 --> 01:27:18.412
Bיkavבr you? ", it has the answer:
Bיkavבr.

01:27:18.413 --> 01:27:21.332
You shame us!
Embarrassing to me,

01:27:21.333 --> 01:27:24.772
Darren's embarrassing for everyone,
who for wasting your time.

01:27:24.773 --> 01:27:27.852
Your work.
Get up and go.

01:27:27.853 --> 01:27:29.132
Fuck you.

01:27:29.133 --> 01:27:32.053
I can not eat it.
You can eat it at the top.

01:27:32.253 --> 01:27:33.773
Take the stairs.

01:27:33.973 --> 01:27:37.973
Get out! Get out!

01:27:38.333 --> 01:27:42.253
Eat it!
Come on! Come on!

01:27:42.453 --> 01:27:45.053
- Go to your room! Get out!
- No!

01:27:45.253 --> 01:27:47.613
Exactly!
Sikםtozףs Lauren!

01:27:47.813 --> 01:27:49.973
It's a Christmas party.

01:27:50.173 --> 01:27:52.013
I'm not interested in excuses.

01:27:52.213 --> 01:27:54.813
You can not talk to them.
Unacceptable to me.

01:27:55.013 --> 01:27:56.933
I do not care ... what's your point.

01:28:50.153 --> 01:28:51.053
In my behavior?
