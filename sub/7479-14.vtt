00:01.234 --> 00:04.204
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:04.405 --> 00:06.873
Mowahd Dusa. Goes by Moe.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.905
- I brought him here.
- From Sudan?

00:09.076 --> 00:11.601
Moe's father was killed.
It was the least I could do.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.474
Moe?

00:13.681 --> 00:14.773
What happens now?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.482
You'll be placed under arrest.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.276
I'm still your brother.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.048
The time has come.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.654
Do it well.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.274
Enough.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.056
Welcome to your new family,
Mowahd.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.705
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.173
- We're here to listen.
- No, I'm fine.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.904
Let her eat her feelings in peace.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.676
All right.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.752
I decided to go on a second date
with the graphic artist.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.719
Okay, and let me guess,
mommy issues?

02:36.890 --> 02:39.859
- He talk in a baby voice?
- No, we had a great night.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.187
Even took me to Medieval Times.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.227
As a joke?

02:44.398 --> 02:46.161
It was cute.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.664
I told him on our first date

02:47.835 --> 02:49.598
that I wanted to go
since I was a kid.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.998
You got a second date?

02:52.573 --> 02:55.041
Where did it go wrong?
He challenge you to a joust?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.904
You do get grumpy when you lose.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.611
He steal your giant turkey leg?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.872
You guys are really funny.
Forget about it.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.673
Go on, Kensi.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.178
I realized
I forgot my wallet in his car,

03:07.554 --> 03:09.112
so I went over this morning,

03:09.289 --> 03:11.450
and I saw him
standing in his driveway,

03:11.658 --> 03:13.558
kissing this blond wench.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.696
- Ooh, language.
- No, no, an actual wench.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.424
Our beer wench
from Medieval Times.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.391
That hurts.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.229
Hello.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.068
This is Oakville Prison.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.403
You're listed as next of kin
for Mowahd Dusa.

03:30.577 --> 03:31.976
He's been assaulted.

03:32.179 --> 03:35.114
- Where is he now?
- He is at Hatfield Hospital.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.045
All right, thanks.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.985
That was Oakville Prison.
Moe was attacked.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.816
Why did they call us?

03:47.594 --> 03:48.925
Not us, me.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.428
I'm listed as his next of kin.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.928
Sam.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.900
Take it easy, Moe.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.096
They should not have called.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.835
Who did this to you?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.836
It's not what you think.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.075
I knew it was coming.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.212
Initiation.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.250
A gang initiation?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.218
I thought
you would've learned by now.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.289
I had no choice.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.791
Of course you had a choice.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.658
You can't let these people
use you like this.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.494
I'm gonna see what I can do
to get you a transfer.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.996
No. I need to go back there.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.534
Why?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.602
Who said
you have to go back there?

04:35.375 --> 04:38.674
They moved me to Oakville
to get close to someone.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.774
They said if I helped them,
they would reduce my time in prison.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.678
Who do you have to get close to?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.786
His name is Abdul Habaza.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.013
And he did this to you?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.494
Abdul is planning something,
I heard them talking.

04:55.662 --> 04:59.564
- It will happen soon.
- Who made you that promise, FBI?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.298
NCIS.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.501
Sorry.
They're here to take him back.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.670
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.348
Sam,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.814
this is my only way out.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.857
- Moe...
- You said we're just like brothers.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.387
Then let me do this.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.896
Please, brother.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.245
The boatshed and not my office.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.478
I'm intrigued, Mr. Callen.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.122
Left on my sister's grave.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.398
A Prussian hussar.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.597
Lead, hand-painted.

06:47.774 --> 06:51.608
Older than I am, if I'm not mistaken.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.073
Significance?

06:55.482 --> 06:57.143
When I was a kid,

06:57.317 --> 07:00.946
a man at a beach handed me
a toy soldier like that.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.924
It brought back the memory.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.091
A message from someone
in your past?

07:16.536 --> 07:21.667
Anyone of interest on the camera
you hid in the birdhouse?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.001
Two visitors.

07:33.153 --> 07:37.055
A walk through the cemetery
clears my mind,

07:37.224 --> 07:40.022
puts everything into perspective.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.719
Second visitor?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.995
You know him?

07:47.434 --> 07:49.026
No.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.995
But I almost met him.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.196
Once.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.234
Hey.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.209
The man you couldn't catch.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.016
I think he wants to meet with me.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.085
Dangerous.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.954
Necessary.

08:16.697 --> 08:17.959
I can't sanction it.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.659
I'm not asking you to.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.063
But I do have time owed.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.000
Indeed you do, Mr. Callen.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.575
Don't get lead poisoning
from this thing.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.426
Guy in the middle's the leader.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.860
Brought in four of his guys
to do the job.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.093
That's a classic gang jump in.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.230
Moe didn't even put up a fight.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.401
You should've told me.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.606
That's precisely why I didn't.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.577
Moe isn't trained for this.
He shouldn't be in there alone.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.410
He isn't in there alone.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.917
You underestimate me, Mr. Hanna.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.420
One of our best people
is in there with him.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.384
Uh, Eric,

09:20.560 --> 09:28.560
ISP number 579.72.351.462.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.270
Access Camera 7.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.804
Okay.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.036
I'm sorry, where is this?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.407
Oakville Federal Prison.

09:42.349 --> 09:46.046
I'm sure Nate
is more than capable of this.

09:59.531 --> 10:02.864
Nate's been tracking
this terrorist organization,

10:03.035 --> 10:08.496
the Warriors for Islam,
since I sent him to Afghanistan.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.075
When we learned that one
of the members of their group

10:12.244 --> 10:14.235
was doing time at Oakville,

10:14.713 --> 10:18.615
I placed Nate there
as a prison psychologist.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.775
You did the same thing with Moe.

10:20.986 --> 10:23.454
Planted him there to get closer
to the organization.

10:23.622 --> 10:24.680
Yes.

10:25.224 --> 10:29.422
So, what about this terrorist,
Abdul Habaza?

10:29.595 --> 10:31.688
He's a member
of Warriors for Islam,

10:31.863 --> 10:35.526
a well-financed terrorist organization
based in Yemen.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.635
They're responsible
for multiple bombings

10:37.803 --> 10:40.294
across the Middle East,
Africa and Europe.

10:40.505 --> 10:43.531
So how is getting close to Abdul
going to get us information

10:43.709 --> 10:46.701
about a terrorist group
halfway around the world?

10:46.878 --> 10:50.939
Because Abdul's brother
is Sadaat Habaza,

10:51.116 --> 10:53.710
head of the Warriors for Islam.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.217
What do we know
about the Warriors for Islam?

10:56.388 --> 10:59.221
Uh, virtually nothing.

10:59.524 --> 11:01.617
You understand, Mr. Hanna?

11:01.827 --> 11:04.455
Guys, Moe's prison bank account
just received funds

11:04.630 --> 11:06.962
from an offshore account
in the Caymans.

11:07.132 --> 11:10.101
It's under the name, uh,
Truftin Industries.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.262
And it's not the first deposit
to be made to an inmate in Oakville.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.166
They jumped Moe in,
now he's on the payroll.

11:17.409 --> 11:20.810
Truftin Industries
is a shell company worth $20 million,

11:21.179 --> 11:23.010
funding several businesses
in the U.S.,

11:23.181 --> 11:25.547
one in West Hollywood.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.082
Got an address for me?

11:27.286 --> 11:29.982
- You just got it.
- Okay.

11:30.255 --> 11:31.654
Stakes just went up.

11:32.624 --> 11:34.148
Yes, they did.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.761
I need to be there.

11:36.962 --> 11:40.420
Is this about taking down a terrorist

11:40.599 --> 11:44.831
or about protecting Moe
because you feel responsible for him?

11:48.307 --> 11:50.002
Mr. Beale,

11:50.375 --> 11:52.707
please start creating
Mr. Hanna's cover.

11:52.878 --> 11:57.838
We'll need IDs, prison records.
Go back at least ten years.

11:58.517 --> 11:59.779
Where's Callen?

11:59.985 --> 12:02.180
Temporarily unavailable.

12:04.856 --> 12:06.289
Keep him safe, Hetty.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.647
Psych Evaluation is in there.

12:33.618 --> 12:35.142
In here.

12:38.724 --> 12:40.715
He's all yours, doc.

12:44.996 --> 12:46.691
Not even a postcard.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.894
I send one every month.

12:51.269 --> 12:52.634
Check Hetty's desk drawer.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.739
- It's good to see you, Sam.
- It's good to see you too.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.167
How's Moe?

12:59.711 --> 13:01.576
He's in the infirmary for now.

13:04.049 --> 13:05.778
He's not cut out for this.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.282
Not many are.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.581
But he is determined
to get out of here,

13:10.756 --> 13:13.919
and right now, that determination
is winning over his fear.

13:14.526 --> 13:16.357
I'm gonna need to stay close to him.

13:22.734 --> 13:26.192
Orderly in the infirmary.
Close enough?

13:27.539 --> 13:28.904
It's close enough.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.904
Are you sure this is the right address?

13:31.076 --> 13:34.739
Well, it's what Eric gave me.
Truftin Industries owns this joint.

13:34.913 --> 13:38.906
Oh. Best assignment ever.

13:39.117 --> 13:40.141
Can I help you?

13:40.318 --> 13:41.580
- Hi, yes.
- Yes.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.915
Uh, I'm Jennifer.
And this here is my brother, Edward.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.114
Edward.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.156
He's shy,
so he made me come with him,

13:48.326 --> 13:51.454
but he is dying
to take your pole dancing class.

13:51.696 --> 13:54.631
I think he wants to surprise
his special friend,

13:55.100 --> 13:56.567
Phil,

13:56.802 --> 13:59.202
with a birthday lap dance.

13:59.404 --> 14:02.635
Anything for Phillipa. Phillipa.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.134
She's English, yeah.
You know those Brits.

14:06.344 --> 14:09.336
Good lap dance really helps them
come out of their shell.

14:09.581 --> 14:11.276
Ha, ha. Not just the Brits.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.815
- Oh, not just...
- Ha, ha.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.852
- Follow me, and I'll give you a tour.
- Absolutely.

14:17.088 --> 14:19.079
Did you hear that, Jen? Hmm?

14:19.257 --> 14:21.418
- Not just the Brits.
- I did, yeah.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.992
- Yeah, you did.
- Ha-ha-ha.

14:24.162 --> 14:25.686
By the way, excuse me.
I'm sorry.

14:25.864 --> 14:28.355
- Where is the ladies' room?
- Upstairs to the right.

14:28.533 --> 14:29.591
Great. You go ahead.

14:30.302 --> 14:33.100
Come this way, Edward,
and I'll show you the warm-up room.

14:33.305 --> 14:34.772
To the warm-up room. I can...

14:34.940 --> 14:37.374
Hi. All right, I'll just go... Hi.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.489
Eric, we're plugged in.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.527
And we have access
to their financial records,

14:58.697 --> 15:01.291
but they're encrypted.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.263
All right, give me a second.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.158
I got a receipt.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.771
Current rental on a silver panel van.

15:08.773 --> 15:09.797
All right. I'm in.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.876
I got a bunch of wire transfers
into various prison accounts.

15:13.044 --> 15:16.013
From the same offshore account
that's paying Moe in prison.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.911
Warriors for Islam
is using this business to send funds.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.053
They have a sophisticated
hard drive wiping system in place.

15:22.220 --> 15:25.587
It's set to delete all files
permanently on Thursday.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.917
Same day their rental van
is due back.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.857
I'm looking at
the leasing agreement for X-Pole.

15:31.062 --> 15:34.259
They look like they have
an assigned garage space out back.

15:34.432 --> 15:35.490
Thanks, guys.

15:50.615 --> 15:52.549
Number six.

16:18.643 --> 16:20.235
Well, no van.

16:26.351 --> 16:27.409
Ammonium nitrate.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.620
Diesel.

16:30.288 --> 16:34.588
Wires and part of a blasting cap.

16:36.928 --> 16:38.987
So we got al Qaeda members
with a panel van,

16:39.164 --> 16:41.860
fertilizer and fuel.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.762
We have two days
to stop a truck bomb.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.681
Hey, Louie,
he'll be with you in a minute.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.122
Sam.

17:09.326 --> 17:11.351
I'm in B Block.
I got assigned up here.

17:11.528 --> 17:13.928
We got eyes on you at all times.

17:14.131 --> 17:15.530
What do you need me to do?

17:20.604 --> 17:22.799
For one, call me Hakeem, not Sam.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.768
Get in with Abdul.
I'm gonna get in with him too.

17:27.711 --> 17:29.178
How?

17:29.346 --> 17:31.644
With a little help from our friends,
the Aryans.

17:39.056 --> 17:42.856
Grey, white, red.

17:43.027 --> 17:45.393
Silver. I got si...

17:45.562 --> 17:47.291
That's Nevada plates, damn it.

17:47.464 --> 17:49.022
You have anything? Kensi.

17:49.233 --> 17:52.464
Put it down. Put the doughnut down.

17:52.670 --> 17:55.298
A moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

17:55.673 --> 17:57.072
I don't know what that means.

17:57.241 --> 17:59.641
Food is not your friend.
We've talked about this.

17:59.810 --> 18:02.643
If you wanna talk some more about
Sir Lancelot, we can.

18:02.813 --> 18:04.246
We were done when you said,

18:04.448 --> 18:06.382
"He's not your knight
in shining armor."

18:06.550 --> 18:09.178
Know what?
I'm staging a one-person intervention.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.378
- Hand over the doughnut. Give it.
- Argh.

18:11.555 --> 18:13.455
Hey, guys. I got a hit.

18:14.992 --> 18:16.584
The van was clocked running a red

18:16.760 --> 18:19.354
at Los Feliz Boulevard
in Silver Lake four days ago.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.589
Couldn't make out the driver
or passenger.

18:21.765 --> 18:24.825
Well, the guys in the van
are Abdul's men on the outside.

18:25.002 --> 18:26.663
Focus your search in Silver Lake

18:26.837 --> 18:28.896
- and find that van, Nell, okay?
- Mm-hm.

18:29.773 --> 18:32.071
- Really?
- What?

18:32.543 --> 18:34.374
- I'm saving you from yourself.
- Yeah?

18:34.545 --> 18:36.536
That's what real friends do.

18:36.914 --> 18:39.576
Where you going? Kensi?

18:41.618 --> 18:43.916
That's not gonna make you happier.

18:45.089 --> 18:49.253
I have put money into your account,
Mowahd Dusa.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.522
From this day on,
you will not want for anything.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.927
But tell me,
who is this new Muslim here?

19:00.137 --> 19:01.195
I do not know,

19:01.371 --> 19:04.898
but he's been very good to me.

19:06.944 --> 19:08.502
Salaam alaikum, my brother.

19:09.546 --> 19:12.071
- What is your name?
- Hakeem Fayed.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.409
Come.

19:17.888 --> 19:19.412
Join us. Talk.

19:20.624 --> 19:21.989
I don't join anything.

19:30.234 --> 19:32.862
Got it. 25 minutes ago,
our silver van turned into.

19:33.036 --> 19:35.664
Saticoy Street in North Hollywood,
and it's still there.

19:35.839 --> 19:36.897
How do we know that?

19:37.074 --> 19:39.269
It's a dead end.
Went in, hasn't come back out.

19:39.443 --> 19:42.412
Saticoy leads
into a warehouse complex.

19:42.579 --> 19:43.910
Lot of places to hide a van.

19:44.081 --> 19:45.139
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

19:51.188 --> 19:53.019
Eric, I need a license check.

19:53.190 --> 19:56.091
Nine-Quebec-49905.

19:56.660 --> 19:58.321
This place looks deserted.

20:01.331 --> 20:04.425
Registered to Mark James Walker.

20:05.636 --> 20:08.537
Kensi, he's employed
as a prison guard at Oakville.

20:08.705 --> 20:10.002
Okay. Thank you.

20:10.207 --> 20:11.868
Owned by a prison guard
at Oakville.

20:12.075 --> 20:13.474
Bingo.

20:27.658 --> 20:29.626
I count two.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.557
And that's our missing rental van.

20:32.729 --> 20:33.821
That's the bomb.

20:40.470 --> 20:43.462
- Did you change the battery?
- All set, man.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.834
Clear.

20:45.008 --> 20:47.374
All right, we're ready to roll.

20:49.046 --> 20:50.411
Federal agents.

21:00.524 --> 21:01.991
Really?

21:02.159 --> 21:04.354
A machine gun?
Isn't that a little excessive?

21:07.931 --> 21:09.398
He doesn't know how to use it.

21:09.633 --> 21:11.362
He seems to be using it
well to me.

21:11.568 --> 21:15.004
He's blowing his entire magazine.
He's gonna have to reload every time.

21:15.172 --> 21:18.437
It will take him at least five seconds.
Antagonize him.

21:18.675 --> 21:20.165
- Get him to fire again.
- What?

21:20.344 --> 21:22.335
What do you want me to do?
Call him names?

21:22.546 --> 21:24.275
- Get him to shoot at you.
- Aw.

21:24.448 --> 21:27.144
You gotta be kidding me.
Okay. Um...

21:27.351 --> 21:30.013
Hey, uh... Hey, man, you suck.

21:30.187 --> 21:32.712
And you look fat in those jeans.

21:33.590 --> 21:36.286
- Stick your head up.
- You want me to stick my head up?

21:36.526 --> 21:39.620
I know we've had our differences
and I'm sorry I stole that doughnut.

21:39.796 --> 21:41.195
Just do it, Deeks. Come on.

21:41.398 --> 21:43.798
- Oh, God.
- Come on, be courageous.

21:44.034 --> 21:46.059
One, two, three.

21:46.236 --> 21:47.430
Hey, listen. Are you...?

21:50.674 --> 21:51.902
- Cover me.
- Five.

21:52.109 --> 21:55.306
Four, three, two.

21:55.545 --> 21:56.876
- One.
- Drop it.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.655
- Clear.
- Okay, clear.

22:12.829 --> 22:15.297
But just for the record,
that was insane.

22:19.202 --> 22:20.396
Locked and loaded.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.765
I don't think
this was a terrorist attack.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.999
What else does one use
a bomb like this for?

22:27.577 --> 22:29.477
Apparently, a prison break.

22:29.713 --> 22:32.773
The plan was for the truck
to blow a hole in the north wall,

22:32.950 --> 22:34.747
while Abdul and Syed
were in the yard.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.476
That's a big-budget escape plan.

22:36.653 --> 22:39.315
Abdul's brother is the leader
of the Warriors for Islam.

22:39.489 --> 22:42.322
Getting him out of a U.S. Prison
is not only high priority,

22:42.492 --> 22:44.653
it's an incredible show of force.

22:45.362 --> 22:48.126
There's something more here.

22:48.298 --> 22:50.459
Maybe we should pull up the file... Hey.

22:50.634 --> 22:52.158
- Hey, guys.
- Nate.

22:52.336 --> 22:54.133
Hi.

22:54.671 --> 22:57.162
- Careful, Eric will get jealous.
- Welcome back.

22:58.108 --> 22:59.735
- Hi, Nate.
- Hi, Nell.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.373
You two know each other?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.607
We go back a few years.

23:05.816 --> 23:07.306
Something wrong?

23:07.517 --> 23:08.643
Maybe.

23:09.486 --> 23:11.613
Excuse us.

23:11.989 --> 23:13.718
Warriors for Islam are as dangerous

23:13.890 --> 23:16.882
as any of the radical groups
I've encountered.

23:17.060 --> 23:20.223
They recruit young, disenchanted
Muslims in prison,

23:20.397 --> 23:22.991
and send them to training camps
in the Horn of Africa.

23:23.166 --> 23:27.159
Yes, I read your report.
That's not why you're here.

23:27.371 --> 23:28.804
It's Sam.

23:29.539 --> 23:33.236
He's always looked out for everyone.
He sees himself as the protector.

23:33.410 --> 23:35.207
He would die for one of us

23:35.379 --> 23:38.007
without giving
the slightest thought for himself.

23:38.181 --> 23:41.014
This is about Moe, isn't it?

23:41.885 --> 23:45.184
Sam sees Moe as part of his family.

23:45.789 --> 23:46.915
Hetty, he's too close.

23:47.090 --> 23:51.652
I send my agents into harm's way
every day, Nate.

23:51.828 --> 23:55.696
Sometimes getting too close
is what they need to do.

23:56.533 --> 23:58.194
Agents becomes friends.

23:58.802 --> 24:00.997
And friends become family.

24:01.204 --> 24:04.935
And they can protect each other.

24:05.509 --> 24:07.067
Moe can't.

24:07.310 --> 24:08.834
Sam is on his own in there.

24:09.012 --> 24:10.673
No.

24:10.847 --> 24:12.747
He has you.

24:13.517 --> 24:16.714
Uh, excuse me, Hetty,
but I ran analysis on all the chatter

24:16.887 --> 24:18.354
that was coming out of Yemen,

24:18.522 --> 24:20.387
and it seemed odd
that so much chatter

24:20.590 --> 24:23.388
would relate to a prison break
happening over here.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.323
But the timing was too coincidental.

24:25.529 --> 24:27.793
I think the plan
is to get Abdul out of prison

24:27.964 --> 24:30.023
because his brother is
planning something.

24:30.233 --> 24:31.860
And from the volume of chatter,

24:32.035 --> 24:34.833
it looks like it's gonna be
something pretty big.

24:37.340 --> 24:41.936
Then we have no choice
but to help Abdul with his plan.

24:42.112 --> 24:43.636
Help him escape?

24:43.847 --> 24:49.649
All the way back
to his family in Yemen.

25:00.396 --> 25:02.694
Chow time will end in 15 minutes.

25:02.899 --> 25:04.730
Chow time will end in 15 minutes.

25:14.043 --> 25:15.772
- Aw...
- Watch yourself.

25:17.546 --> 25:20.777
Abdul is planning a breakout,
but the guard he paid off is dead.

25:20.950 --> 25:24.386
Hetty wants us to break him out
ourselves, but it has to be convincing.

25:25.221 --> 25:29.385
She wants you to stay with him
all the way to Yemen, if you can.

25:29.792 --> 25:33.057
- How long do we have?
- The sooner the better.

25:33.629 --> 25:35.688
Okay, we're gonna need a plan.

25:38.567 --> 25:42.230
Tell Eric to cut the cameras off
in the Aryan block in 15 minutes.

25:42.405 --> 25:46.068
Damn, doc, I said I was sorry.
Send me a dry cleaning bill.

25:46.509 --> 25:47.999
I might.

25:52.515 --> 25:54.346
White boys sure look cute together.

25:54.517 --> 25:56.815
Those stories they tell about you
must be true.

25:56.986 --> 25:58.851
Can you believe this, man?

26:05.594 --> 26:09.690
I'm gonna do something right now.
You just remain calm, okay?

26:09.865 --> 26:11.992
Just stay behind me.
It's all gonna be good.

26:12.168 --> 26:13.601
You trust me?

26:13.769 --> 26:15.532
I trust you.

26:16.305 --> 26:19.297
- But I don't think this is a good idea.
- It's gonna be fine.

26:20.476 --> 26:22.967
Every time I see you ladies,
you get prettier.

26:23.145 --> 26:24.840
You look better in red than me.

26:25.014 --> 26:26.675
Keep talking, Jack.

26:26.849 --> 26:28.874
You're dead, pretty boy.

26:52.641 --> 26:53.903
Break it up.

26:54.076 --> 26:56.544
We got code 3 in the hallway
outside the cafeteria.

26:56.712 --> 26:58.270
All right. That's enough.

26:58.481 --> 27:01.882
Break it up. Get him out of here.

27:02.051 --> 27:03.382
Let's go.

27:03.586 --> 27:05.349
Against the walls.

27:05.988 --> 27:07.819
What are you looking at, dirt bags?

27:08.424 --> 27:10.585
Show's over. Eyes forward.

27:16.098 --> 27:18.089
You could learn from him, Syed.

27:18.300 --> 27:21.827
Turn around.
You two, against the wall.

27:23.406 --> 27:26.842
You're gonna have to figure out
a way to get comms to Sam.

27:27.009 --> 27:30.069
What's his status?
Is he still being questioned?

27:30.246 --> 27:32.737
Guards bought the story
it was an unprovoked attack.

27:32.915 --> 27:34.576
You can turn the cameras back on.

27:34.817 --> 27:37.513
All right, cameras are back online.

27:39.088 --> 27:42.854
Eric, Camera 12 outside my office,
guard talking to Abdul.

27:43.059 --> 27:45.619
Huh. Abdul is not a happy camper.

27:45.861 --> 27:47.920
Guard's name is David Jacobs.

27:48.097 --> 27:50.292
Abdul's got the power.
Jacobs is taking orders.

27:50.466 --> 27:52.957
Okay, Jacobs is an associate
of Mark Walker,

27:53.202 --> 27:55.227
the prison guard killed
at the warehouse.

27:55.438 --> 27:57.406
We need audio.

27:57.573 --> 27:59.973
Nate, is there a chance
you can get close to them?

28:00.209 --> 28:01.233
We need an audio feed.

28:01.410 --> 28:04.243
Hanging up now,
switching to comms.

28:14.957 --> 28:16.618
Okay.

28:20.262 --> 28:23.095
- A name.
- He wants $10,000 in cash.

28:23.265 --> 28:25.426
Can you get any closer?

28:30.072 --> 28:31.630
Closer.

28:31.941 --> 28:33.568
If he gets any closer,

28:33.742 --> 28:36.677
he might as well just ask them
what they're talking about.

28:37.746 --> 28:39.475
Game's up, Nate. Walk away.

28:40.116 --> 28:41.947
Did you get anything?

28:42.151 --> 28:43.948
Maybe.

28:56.665 --> 28:58.394
An impressive display, Hakeem.

28:59.969 --> 29:03.996
I could, uh, use somebody
with your skills.

29:04.840 --> 29:08.003
Like I said, it's not my thing.

29:08.177 --> 29:09.474
Even a man like you

29:09.645 --> 29:11.943
needs somebody
to watch his back sometimes.

29:12.114 --> 29:15.982
Yeah?
Let me know when the time comes.

29:16.318 --> 29:18.650
There are other benefits.

29:20.156 --> 29:23.319
Members of this family
are extremely well paid,

29:23.526 --> 29:25.721
even inside here.

29:25.961 --> 29:30.398
You seem like a good man
and a good Muslim.

29:32.301 --> 29:35.134
But the truth is,
I don't intend on being here too long.

29:36.372 --> 29:38.636
With all due respect,

29:40.342 --> 29:41.639
shukran, my friend.

29:43.712 --> 29:45.475
Shukran, my brother.

29:50.553 --> 29:51.815
He's planning something.

29:52.021 --> 29:53.852
Stay close to him.

29:56.492 --> 29:58.392
But make sure he understands
that my reach goes

29:58.561 --> 30:00.654
well beyond these walls.

30:00.863 --> 30:02.763
Yes, brother.

30:10.573 --> 30:12.700
Any progress, Mr. Beale?

30:12.908 --> 30:15.502
Uh, almost got it.

30:20.382 --> 30:23.442
He was in admin, saw some
paperwork he shouldn't have.

30:23.619 --> 30:25.109
I need a name. Who is it?

30:27.790 --> 30:29.485
I can't tell you who it is.

30:30.359 --> 30:32.350
- Why not?
- I just can't.

30:32.561 --> 30:34.927
Come on. Give him a name.

30:35.097 --> 30:38.430
- Right now.
- He wants $10,000 in cash.

30:38.601 --> 30:40.262
Give me the account number.

30:40.436 --> 30:43.496
I will transfer the money as soon
as you give me the name.

30:43.706 --> 30:45.640
If we don't know
who's selling the name...

30:45.808 --> 30:46.866
We're on a clock.

30:47.042 --> 30:49.306
We don't even know
whose name he's actually got.

30:49.511 --> 30:50.603
It could be Sam or Moe.

30:50.813 --> 30:52.212
Or Nate.

30:52.381 --> 30:53.712
We need to abort.

30:53.882 --> 30:56.043
This is our chance to infiltrate

30:56.218 --> 31:00.416
one of the most dangerous
terrorist groups in Yemen.

31:00.623 --> 31:05.083
The choice is never easy
when the stakes are lives.

31:05.828 --> 31:08.023
We stay in.

31:21.475 --> 31:23.966
Abdul's about to make
one of us. We gotta move.

31:24.145 --> 31:25.203
Everything's ready?

31:25.446 --> 31:27.073
I'm sending him to you momentarily.

31:27.248 --> 31:30.581
Drink some water.
It will help with your hearing.

31:32.453 --> 31:34.751
- Eric, I have ears.
- Indeed you have, Sam.

31:34.989 --> 31:37.355
Hakeem can be very useful to us.

31:37.525 --> 31:38.924
We need him.

31:39.093 --> 31:40.754
Abdul Habaza, right?

31:40.961 --> 31:43.395
- Yes.
- Oh.

31:43.564 --> 31:45.555
Well, you are being
transferred tomorrow.

31:45.733 --> 31:49.225
So I need to get you in
for your out-processing evaluation.

31:51.238 --> 31:52.762
I'm being transferred?

31:53.340 --> 31:56.605
I thought they already told you.

31:58.179 --> 32:00.272
I'm... I'm sorry. Uh...

32:01.382 --> 32:03.373
Let me get back to you.

32:11.926 --> 32:13.621
Hakeem.

32:15.563 --> 32:16.689
Salaam alaikum, my brother.

32:18.499 --> 32:21.991
I've been informed you are working
on a plan to get out of here.

32:23.804 --> 32:26.534
- Syed and I need to come.
- You were misinformed.

32:26.707 --> 32:29.073
What if I could get you
out of the country

32:29.243 --> 32:31.871
to a place
where you will be hailed as a hero?

32:32.046 --> 32:33.513
Where there are no prisons?

32:33.714 --> 32:36.148
I can get you papers
and safe passage.

32:36.317 --> 32:39.775
You can start life anew
among brothers.

32:43.824 --> 32:45.758
Not interested.

32:46.327 --> 32:48.056
You may escape,

32:48.229 --> 32:52.165
but understand I have people
that will hunt you down.

32:52.433 --> 32:54.924
And when they do,
your fighting prowess

32:55.102 --> 32:58.094
will be of no use to you
because you will not see them coming.

32:58.539 --> 33:03.602
I am a man that you should be
working with, not against.

33:08.182 --> 33:09.649
I can get you out today.

33:12.953 --> 33:15.751
But it will cost you. Human life.

33:15.956 --> 33:18.481
Killing is a means to an end,
my brother.

33:26.267 --> 33:28.633
You and Syed play basketball.

33:30.070 --> 33:31.094
Twist your ankle.

33:31.272 --> 33:33.570
Get the guards
to bring you to the infirmary.

33:36.076 --> 33:37.976
I'm gonna need him.

33:49.323 --> 33:50.984
We've got a problem.

33:51.158 --> 33:54.184
That's one of the assistant wardens,
Michael Shainby.

33:54.395 --> 33:56.886
I just caught him accessing
Sam's prison records.

33:57.097 --> 34:00.032
And the other guy is Sam's cell mate,
Brandon Bassner.

34:00.234 --> 34:02.293
He's one of Abdul's followers.

34:02.469 --> 34:05.199
I think we just found our snitch.

34:07.641 --> 34:08.665
- Nate?
- I heard.

34:08.842 --> 34:10.969
That's how they had access
to the paperwork.

34:11.145 --> 34:12.476
Shainby's bank account

34:12.679 --> 34:14.841
just received payment
from Truftin Industries,

34:15.014 --> 34:18.074
the same shell company that was
paying Abdul's gang members.

34:18.252 --> 34:20.914
Sam, your cover's been blown.
Brandon's just found out.

34:21.121 --> 34:22.418
That's great.

34:25.926 --> 34:26.984
Nurse here?

34:27.161 --> 34:28.185
Inside.

34:28.362 --> 34:30.023
Stay here.

34:30.496 --> 34:31.759
Anyone seen Abdul?

34:31.931 --> 34:34.992
He hurt his ankle,
went to the infirmary.

34:37.036 --> 34:39.437
Sam, clock is ticking.

34:39.672 --> 34:40.731
I got it. I got it.

34:41.242 --> 34:43.870
Help me. Help me.

34:46.647 --> 34:48.842
Help me get him on the gurney.

34:50.050 --> 34:51.677
Help me.

34:55.456 --> 34:57.924
- What the hell happened here?
- He's bleeding out.

34:58.092 --> 35:01.084
I take my finger off this artery,
he's gonna die.

35:01.262 --> 35:04.595
- We got a stabbing at the infirmary.
- We need an ambulance.

35:04.798 --> 35:07.699
- Call an ambulance.
- Copy, I'll check.

35:10.037 --> 35:12.471
Brandon's about to tell Abdul.

35:12.973 --> 35:15.066
Step aside. Step aside.

35:16.043 --> 35:18.273
Nate, you need to stop him.

35:19.079 --> 35:21.138
Keep it coming, let's go. Heads up.

35:21.315 --> 35:23.977
Eric, turn off the security cameras
in Cell Block E.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.217
Done.

35:27.388 --> 35:30.323
Abdul needs to speak with you.

35:47.808 --> 35:49.571
It's done. Brandon's down.

35:51.011 --> 35:53.946
Eric, shut down the cameras
between Sam and the loading dock,

35:54.114 --> 35:55.445
and trigger the fire alarms.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.440
Guard. Guard.

35:57.618 --> 36:00.485
There's a race riot down by the library.
They need everyone.

36:00.654 --> 36:02.332
Take this guy in the ambulance,
find another guard

36:02.356 --> 36:04.517
and get those two back to B Block,
all right?

36:04.725 --> 36:06.022
I need you to come with me.

36:06.226 --> 36:08.217
And you. Let's go.

36:13.167 --> 36:16.102
Hey, wait. What are you doing here?

36:17.237 --> 36:20.035
What's going on? No, no, no, don't.

36:22.509 --> 36:25.307
I told you there'd be a cost.
Help me hide the body.

36:27.781 --> 36:29.544
Hide in there.

36:42.396 --> 36:44.125
Paramedic.

36:51.071 --> 36:52.834
Let's move.

36:55.042 --> 36:58.068
Syed, get him inside, get in here.

37:10.824 --> 37:12.985
Civilian admin personnel

37:13.160 --> 37:15.492
are instructed to leave the premises.

37:15.696 --> 37:17.095
All admin civilian personnel

37:17.297 --> 37:19.822
are instructed
to leave the premises.

37:23.904 --> 37:26.839
Hold up. I need to check the back.

37:33.313 --> 37:35.372
Careful, this guy's got hepatitis C.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.241
Good luck with that, pal.

37:42.423 --> 37:44.323
Let them through.

37:56.103 --> 37:58.901
We did it. We did it.

38:02.709 --> 38:03.733
We are free.

38:10.284 --> 38:11.979
Okay, got any clothes?

38:13.787 --> 38:15.982
Sure you don't wanna spend the night?

38:29.236 --> 38:31.329
Hakeem, get rid of the ambulance.

38:31.505 --> 38:33.234
Mowahd and Syed
will come with me.

38:33.407 --> 38:35.500
Meet us at the motel.

38:50.324 --> 38:52.121
Here's the Overwatch marker.

38:52.292 --> 38:53.657
Just press down the top.

38:53.894 --> 38:57.489
All we need's a little bit in the back
of the neck to track his movements.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.492
Good luck.

39:20.621 --> 39:21.986
You make your contact?

39:22.189 --> 39:23.622
We have a problem.

39:25.225 --> 39:27.386
I have been informed
that someone close to me

39:27.561 --> 39:29.153
is working for a federal agency.

39:29.329 --> 39:31.627
He might have just made Sam.

39:31.798 --> 39:33.993
Mowahd said he might know.

39:36.436 --> 39:39.303
- Any idea who?
- Take the shot?

39:39.473 --> 39:42.237
Not until he says the distress word.

39:42.476 --> 39:44.376
- I'll ask him.
- No, no, no.

39:44.545 --> 39:46.672
I already have.

39:49.016 --> 39:50.847
At first I thought it was you.

39:52.686 --> 39:56.053
But when I saw you kill
the doctor and the EMTs...

39:59.259 --> 40:01.056
Mowahd give you a name?

40:05.232 --> 40:06.699
Syed.

40:09.203 --> 40:13.333
Mowahd reminded me that for a few
months he was in 24-hour lockdown.

40:13.507 --> 40:16.999
The FBI worked him
until he agreed to spy for them.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.544
Syed never trusted me.

40:22.583 --> 40:23.948
He was in a rival gang.

40:24.117 --> 40:27.018
He only agreed to join the cause
before going into solitary.

40:27.854 --> 40:29.287
Here.

40:30.591 --> 40:32.616
An e-mail account.

40:34.261 --> 40:36.525
When the time comes,
I will contact you.

40:37.097 --> 40:38.530
I will arrange for a passport

40:38.699 --> 40:43.636
so you can leave the country
and join our cause, my brother.

40:49.943 --> 40:52.377
I will see you in Yemen, Hakeem.

41:05.826 --> 41:07.123
Syed's dead.

41:07.327 --> 41:09.022
I'm going.

41:11.398 --> 41:13.423
Moe?

41:13.634 --> 41:14.794
Moe?

41:20.240 --> 41:21.764
Moe...

41:34.588 --> 41:36.055
They killed Moe.

41:36.256 --> 41:37.814
I'm sorry, Moe.

41:37.991 --> 41:39.549
I'm sorry.

41:41.662 --> 41:44.597
- Sam, there's a bigger picture here.
- Get out of my way.

41:44.998 --> 41:46.625
Sam.

41:48.268 --> 41:50.202
I'm sorry.

41:50.671 --> 41:53.697
This is the way it has to be.

41:58.445 --> 42:00.811
That's Abdul's Overwatch signature.

42:00.981 --> 42:03.643
He just got off a plane in Sana'a.

42:06.887 --> 42:09.879
Because of your work, Mr. Hanna,

42:10.090 --> 42:15.858
we're on the verge of exposing
a very dangerous terrorist network.

42:16.096 --> 42:19.588
You can't protect everyone.

42:22.402 --> 42:24.393
Mr. Hanna.

42:26.306 --> 42:31.642
There will be a time and a place
for what you want.

42:32.145 --> 42:35.740
And I promise you, you'll have it.

43:05.679 --> 43:07.112
Leave a message.

43:07.280 --> 43:11.216
Mr. Callen, it's been 48 hours.

43:11.385 --> 43:12.943
You're missed.

43:13.153 --> 43:15.018
Please call me.
