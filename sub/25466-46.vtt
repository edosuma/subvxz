08:33.382 --> 08:34.775
So, Bumblebee,

08:34.818 --> 08:36.951
which team
will you choose?

08:36.994 --> 08:39.910
[Bumblebee] Hmm.
These prizes are amazing.

08:39.954 --> 08:41.738
I don't know if I can decide...

08:41.782 --> 08:43.610
Allows me to make that decision

08:43.653 --> 08:45.655
a little easier for you,
Honeymama.

08:45.699 --> 08:48.876
[elephant trumpeting]

08:48.919 --> 08:49.920
Hey. That's not fair.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.835
Two can play at that game.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.534
[dolphin squeaking]

08:55.665 --> 08:56.840
Yeah, so...

08:56.884 --> 08:58.233
I'm going to go be Batman, now.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.451
Not so fast.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.802
There's one last way
to decide your fate.

09:01.845 --> 09:02.977
Let me guess...

09:03.020 --> 09:06.110
[all] The viewers.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.765
[Robin] It's the
Bumblebee Telethon!!

09:08.809 --> 09:10.332
Viewers at home,

09:10.375 --> 09:11.986
call that number
at the bottom of the screen

09:12.029 --> 09:13.596
and make your voice heard.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.555
For Titans East,

09:23.824 --> 09:28.611
Or for Titans West,
enter code: 4.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.614
Now, let's throw it over
to Raven in the phone room.

09:31.658 --> 09:32.833
-Robin...
-[telephone ringing]

09:32.876 --> 09:34.748
...these phones are ringing
off the hook

09:34.791 --> 09:36.358
as callers
from all over the world
are casting their votes.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.752
Ooh...

09:38.795 --> 09:40.971
Doesn't seem like Titans East
is getting too many calls.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.625
Gee, I wonder why.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.714
Time is running out, call now.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.847

09:46.890 --> 09:49.632
Looks like them

09:49.676 --> 09:50.807
They voted for us!

09:50.851 --> 09:52.940
[crowd cheering]

09:52.983 --> 09:54.594
Read it and weep, chumps.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.683
[all cheering]

09:58.249 --> 10:00.512
We won, whoo-hoo!

10:00.556 --> 10:02.471
In your face, Titans East.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.081
Bumblebee is ours.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.039
Uh...

10:05.082 --> 10:06.954
Yo, Bumblebee left.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.086
Uh, who cares.

10:09.130 --> 10:09.913
We won.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.480
[all cheering]

10:11.523 --> 10:12.655
[Cyborg] All right.

10:12.699 --> 10:13.656
STARFIRE:
We are the winners!

10:15.789 --> 10:16.746
[intense music playing]

10:16.790 --> 10:18.574
I am vengeance.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.228
I am the night.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.621
I...

10:21.664 --> 10:22.622
am Batbee.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.537
[both cackling]
