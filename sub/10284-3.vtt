WEBVTT

00:05.300 --> 00:07.146
Previously on E.R.:

00:07.200 --> 00:10.440
- I am no longer Chief of Staff.
- I need my job back!

00:10.440 --> 00:12.423
Kovac is going to offer you the job.

00:12.423 --> 00:15.367
- We're colleagues. We're contemporaries.
- Hey, no touch, no touch.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.426
Every day, I keep thinking they're going
to come and arrest me.

00:17.426 --> 00:18.904
Well, just stop worrying about that.

00:19.287 --> 00:22.183
- Just focus on Alex.
- He knows his dad is gone.

00:22.183 --> 00:24.449
No, no, no, Gates!
You cannot put in an EJ.

00:24.449 --> 00:26.445
E.R. said okay on the EJ!

00:26.446 --> 00:28.400
- I told you not to do that!
- You're dead.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.542
Take it easy!
All right! Okay, okay, okay!

00:30.551 --> 00:33.418
But you're in my E.R. now,
so put on the damn coat.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.622
You're a new intern?

00:37.539 --> 00:40.220
Resident in-service exam is Friday.

00:40.227 --> 00:42.863
Practice questions and instructions
are in the packet.

00:42.865 --> 00:43.982
We just got here, boss.

00:43.985 --> 00:45.790
Shouldn't we learn something
before you start testing us?

00:45.795 --> 00:48.223
It's to get a baseline.
We'll retest you at the end of the year.

00:48.225 --> 00:50.183
Um, is there a makeup date?

00:50.187 --> 00:52.963
'Cause Friday's my day off.
I volunteer at Big Sister/Little Sister.

00:52.966 --> 00:56.041
Yeah, well, I'm post-call, which means
I volunteer to sleep all day.

00:56.045 --> 00:58.742
Too bad. Conference Room, 8:00 a.m.

00:59.006 --> 00:59.830
Come on, guys.

00:59.837 --> 01:00.941
All right.
Who else is on?

01:00.946 --> 01:03.402
Weaver's on at 12:00.
Until then, you're in charge.

01:03.407 --> 01:04.393
What about Morris?

01:04.397 --> 01:05.381
He just called.

01:05.385 --> 01:07.501
He's running late.
Says to start without him.

01:07.507 --> 01:09.943
Late? For his first shift as an Attending?
Did he say why?

01:09.947 --> 01:13.600
I couldn't really understand him.
It was windy, and the music was loud there.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.711
Windy ?

01:16.235 --> 01:24.261
# Believe it or not, I'm walking on air
I never thought I could feel so free #

01:24.605 --> 01:28.301
# Flying away on a wing and a prayer... #

01:28.385 --> 01:30.403
Rat-bite kid is in bed C.

01:30.406 --> 01:32.831
Waiting on a shot of penicillin
and a piece of pizza.

01:32.836 --> 01:35.401
- Ah! The surgeon is in.
- I think I left my badge here.

01:35.516 --> 01:36.270
Are you nervous?

01:36.278 --> 01:38.733
No, I'm okay.
Happy rounding.

01:39.306 --> 01:41.453
First day on rotation.
Don't let those eggheads haze you!

01:41.455 --> 01:43.600
Sidewalk was crooked, damn it!
I want to talk to Johnnie!

01:43.606 --> 01:45.341
Ma'am! You're gonna have
to call them back later!

01:45.345 --> 01:47.881
Look here, J-Lo!
I got ten minutes left on my card,

01:47.888 --> 01:50.530
and I ain't signing anything
until I talk to my attorney!

01:50.537 --> 01:52.403
Don't you tell me
that Johnnie Cochran's dead!

01:52.406 --> 01:54.243
- Lady, give me a break.
- What about Al Sharpton?

01:54.248 --> 01:56.671
- It's not heavy.
- They found some bad wiring after the shootout.

01:56.677 --> 01:58.263
Turns out the whole place
is like a tinderbox.

01:58.268 --> 01:59.810
Really? Got a light?

02:00.005 --> 02:02.883
James Anderson, shortness of breath,
history of congestive heart failure.

02:02.885 --> 02:04.771
Gave Nitrospray and 40 of Lasix.

02:04.776 --> 02:08.062
40? The guy's a chronic CHF'er.
40 won't do the trick. He needs 80.

02:08.067 --> 02:11.291
Protocol says 40. Not that I'd expect
you to know, or give a damn.

02:11.295 --> 02:13.381
Picked him up in the hall
of his apartment.

02:13.385 --> 02:15.152
- All right, on the count. Ready?
- Place had some wild stuff--

02:15.155 --> 02:17.841
- feather boas, stiletto heels, wigs.
- One, two, three!

02:17.938 --> 02:20.161
Sounds like your locker.
What meds is he on?

02:20.166 --> 02:22.723
It's right there on the paramedic sheet,
which is also part of the...

02:22.727 --> 02:24.983
Protocol. Right.
I smell a theme.

02:24.985 --> 02:26.222
80 of Lasix.

02:26.788 --> 02:27.841
Sats suck.

02:28.745 --> 02:30.850
- Must have a bad lead.
- Oh, yeah, he does. Look at this.

02:30.856 --> 02:33.373
It's on his chest hair.
Is that part of the... what do you call...

02:33.375 --> 02:34.471
protocol?

02:35.767 --> 02:38.991
Isodril, Bumex, Glyburide...

02:39.406 --> 02:40.961
Benzoin for the chest lead.

02:42.785 --> 02:46.991
All right.
Protonix, Diovan, Carvedilol.

02:47.708 --> 02:48.701
Let me help you.

02:48.958 --> 02:51.412
- All right, sats are up.
- Lasix in.

02:51.496 --> 02:52.790
Hey, can you look at me?

02:53.805 --> 02:54.752
That's good.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.451
Saved your ass again, Zades.

03:00.907 --> 03:03.201
Hey, where's that famous sense
of humor of yours?

03:03.208 --> 03:04.800
It was bad enough before.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.693
Now I got to roll in here
and have you playing me

03:06.698 --> 03:08.943
'cause somebody was dumb enough
to give you a white coat?

03:08.947 --> 03:11.452
- What are you so pissed off about?
- I'm on probation!

03:11.506 --> 03:12.520
For a month!

03:12.527 --> 03:16.191
Limited shifts, no extra runs,
and one wrong move, I'm finished.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.710
What? Those two drunk guys
outside of Ike's? They press charges?

03:18.717 --> 03:22.262
No. The bar manager filed a complaint,
so Chief's got to make sure I feel it.

03:22.318 --> 03:23.533
I didn't hear anything about it.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.940
Well of course not.
You're Mr. Teflon.

03:25.948 --> 03:28.231
- Only now it's Doctor Teflon.
- This is no big deal.

03:28.236 --> 03:32.271
- What's probation a month?
- It's my job, man! My job.

03:34.956 --> 03:38.150
You know, the one good thing
about you working here,

03:38.157 --> 03:41.783
you may just have to listen to somebody
besides yourself once in a while.

03:42.066 --> 03:44.823
And I can't wait to see those sparks fly.

03:45.005 --> 03:47.150
I'll catch you later, killer.

03:54.806 --> 03:57.780
Well, he didn't mean "killer" killer.
He meant...

03:57.908 --> 03:58.982
You know.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.533
All right, back to work, everyone.

04:00.536 --> 04:02.651
Barack! Barack Obama!

04:02.656 --> 04:04.660
Don't waste my time!
Put him on!

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.008 --> 04:41.011
Benny?

04:41.015 --> 04:42.332
Your neighbor's on the phone.

04:42.337 --> 04:43.723
Something about Jim.

05:02.146 --> 05:03.142
Triage desk.

05:03.146 --> 05:05.512
I know, I'm here for someone.
James Anderson.

05:05.515 --> 05:07.520
They brought him in about
an hour ago, I think.

05:07.528 --> 05:09.511
Triage desk.

05:17.445 --> 05:19.922
- Hello. I...
- Fill out this form, sir.

05:19.926 --> 05:21.303
I'm here to see a patient.

05:21.308 --> 05:24.582
Oh. Okay. Then try this one.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.130
Easy, now.
We got enough patients already.

05:34.276 --> 05:37.513
- Charity, I got one for you.
- Um... Hope. My name is Hope.

05:37.515 --> 05:39.631
Right.
Eight-year-old girl fell off her bike.

05:39.637 --> 05:41.620
Oh, poor little angel.

05:42.858 --> 05:45.230
- Hey, think fast!
- What's this?

05:45.236 --> 05:48.343
It's your lucky day. Residents get
to wear the new transport beeper.

05:48.657 --> 05:49.992
Wait a minute.
If this thing goes off,

05:49.996 --> 05:51.990
I can sign out my patients and go, right?

05:52.005 --> 05:55.542
Well, if your Attending-- i.e. me--
agrees that the patient is critical

05:55.545 --> 05:58.823
and needs a physician transport,
then yes, Ray, you may go.

05:58.828 --> 06:01.610
Sweet. I'm going to go check
the transport locker.

06:01.658 --> 06:03.093
Is Dr. Kovac around?

06:03.298 --> 06:04.570
Hey, how you doing?

06:04.575 --> 06:06.580
I think Dr. K ran upstairs,

06:06.585 --> 06:09.071
but I'm pretty sure
I can help you with anything you need.

06:09.075 --> 06:13.531
You represent this hospital, and that's how you
approach people asking for help at this desk?

06:13.537 --> 06:17.580
Angela, I was waiting for you upstairs.
I'm sorry. My train was late,

06:17.586 --> 06:20.971
but I had the lovely opportunity
to meet Dr. Pratt.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.090
Impressive.

06:23.626 --> 06:25.363
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.210
Haleh, what the hell just happened?

06:30.216 --> 06:32.152
I think you got served.

06:32.538 --> 06:34.381
Greg Pratt, Timmy Rawlins.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.260
- He's going to be filling in for Jerry.
- Really ?

06:36.267 --> 06:39.422
In fact, he was Jerry
before Jerry was Jerry.

06:40.507 --> 06:43.363
Back in the mid-'90s, I got stuck
in a rut. I had to get out of here.

06:43.366 --> 06:45.741
- Out of the hospital?
- No. Out of Chicago.

06:46.008 --> 06:49.502
I lived in the Kalahari for a while,
selling biltong outside of Kakamas.

06:49.505 --> 06:53.063
Then I spent a couple years mining
uranium in the Siberian tundra.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.512
Ran into a misunderstanding in Thailand.

06:55.518 --> 06:57.783
That landed me in a Bangkwang prison.

06:57.925 --> 07:01.041
- But most of the '90s are still a blur.
- Wow. Sounds rugged.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.593
Hell, I'd take Bangkwang over E.R.
this time of year.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.191
I hear that.

07:04.198 --> 07:07.302
Yeah. You know, them new interns will
mess you up worse than Chinese hash.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.802
Ain't that the truth.

07:12.138 --> 07:14.233
It's about the Curtis Ames case.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.923
Risk management wants to meet
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.370
Curtis Ames?

07:18.506 --> 07:21.350
Left-sided paralysis following
an embolic stroke.

07:21.354 --> 07:25.632
You placed a central line for pneumonia,
and he boarded down here for three days.

07:26.201 --> 07:27.598
February of '04.

07:27.620 --> 07:31.172
Oh, oh, oh.
But I thought the case had no merit.

07:31.309 --> 07:34.090
- The guy wants his day in court.
- But the lawyers said...

07:34.096 --> 07:36.181
I mean, it's been over a year
since my deposition.

07:36.187 --> 07:38.152
Excuse me?
Are you Angela from Staff Affairs?

07:38.206 --> 07:39.563
- "Ms. Gilliam."
- Ms. Gilliam,

07:39.565 --> 07:40.970
there's a Dr. Tremons on the phone.

07:40.978 --> 07:42.443
He says his privileges
have been suspended.

07:42.447 --> 07:45.291
Tell him the Anesthesia Chair
has to keep his ACLS current

07:45.296 --> 07:47.901
just like every other physician
in this hospital.

07:48.528 --> 07:50.602
Okay. I got you, baby.

07:52.506 --> 07:56.610
Look, malpractice suits are
a waste of time and resources,

07:56.615 --> 07:59.702
but it happens to almost
every doctor at some point.

08:00.108 --> 08:03.013
It doesn't reflect on
your abilities as a physician.

08:04.367 --> 08:05.622
See you tomorrow.

08:09.708 --> 08:11.502
Ultrasound confirmed cholecystitis.

08:11.506 --> 08:13.532
Hang a bag of ertapenem,
and send her up to surgery.

08:13.537 --> 08:15.903
- I'll give the nursing report.
- Scaphoid fracture.

08:15.905 --> 08:17.622
Thumb spica.
In bed A.

08:18.095 --> 08:20.433
- Discharge with clinic referral.
- No problem.

08:20.905 --> 08:22.072
This one over here?

08:22.075 --> 08:24.123
Curling iron upper inner thigh.

08:24.575 --> 08:26.791
Dressing, tetanus,
and send her on her way.

08:26.795 --> 08:29.162
- How do you even do that?
- Don't ask, don't tell.

08:29.368 --> 08:31.720
Pratt, sign Gates up for some more.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.942
- Man knows how to clear a bed.
- Really?

08:33.945 --> 08:35.822
So why do I have two patients
with blank charts,

08:35.825 --> 08:37.743
and I haven't heard
about your CHF guy yet?

08:37.746 --> 08:39.610
He's stable.
We're waiting on labs.

08:39.615 --> 08:42.892
- Sats are 91. He's hypoxic.
- That was before oxygen and lasix.

08:43.065 --> 08:45.541
- Well, what's the EKG show?
- Nothing to worry about.

08:45.606 --> 08:47.632
This gentleman is here
for James Anderson.

08:49.345 --> 08:50.313
You family?

08:50.466 --> 08:53.681
We're business partners.
My name's Cray. Bennett Cray.

08:53.688 --> 08:56.030
All right, Dr. Gates can take you in.
But keep me apprised.

08:56.035 --> 08:56.972
All right.

08:57.006 --> 08:59.363
We're waiting on some test results,
but...

08:59.367 --> 09:01.581
we could use some more information
on his medical status.

09:01.587 --> 09:04.340
Yes, I can help that.
I brought in his meds.

09:05.388 --> 09:08.733
Your, uh... mascara's running.

09:09.437 --> 09:11.252
It was a long night.

09:12.555 --> 09:15.392
You round twice a day, 5:30 a.m.
and 7:30 p.m.

09:15.397 --> 09:17.943
In between, you'll cover floor
patients and consults.

09:17.947 --> 09:19.791
And, hopefully,
scrub in on a few cases.

09:19.798 --> 09:21.003
Sure.

09:22.008 --> 09:26.041
Neela, this is Jill Connely
and Ken Maser, your fellow interns.

09:26.046 --> 09:27.612
This is Dr. Crenshaw.

09:28.136 --> 09:30.273
- Dustin? Dustin?
- No, I don't think so.

09:30.285 --> 09:33.760
What I asked for was
a freakin' ginger ale!

09:34.705 --> 09:36.703
Dr. Crenshaw is our new Chief Resident.

09:36.798 --> 09:38.013
Neela Rasgotra.

09:38.107 --> 09:41.943
Put in two years in the E.R.,
then defected to become a real doctor.

09:42.117 --> 09:45.091
Wow! Took you that long to figure out
you were wasting your time?

09:45.235 --> 09:48.612
- Well, I don't think of it that way.
- Really? And why is that?

09:50.028 --> 09:53.773
I developed clinical
and procedural skills.

09:54.257 --> 09:57.821
I became proficient at ultrasounds,

09:58.605 --> 10:00.993
central lines, chest tubes, cut downs.

10:01.705 --> 10:03.293
You know what worries me?

10:03.355 --> 10:06.760
Maybe all of this is going
to seem too easy.

10:06.768 --> 10:09.022
You think? Maybe there's a chance
you might actually be...

10:09.026 --> 10:11.190
oh, I don't know, what's the word, um...

10:11.195 --> 10:14.181
bored... by what we do up here?

10:14.506 --> 10:15.782
I don't think so.

10:16.008 --> 10:17.072
Good.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.490
Good. Then I think I'll leave you all to it.

10:19.497 --> 10:20.610
Bye.

10:20.805 --> 10:25.191
Someone want to explain to our international
prodigy here how we do wound rounds?

10:34.005 --> 10:35.243
Mr. Cray.

10:35.668 --> 10:36.550
Doctor.

10:37.155 --> 10:39.373
His oxygen level is up.
He should be waking soon.

10:39.378 --> 10:40.912
Is there any family he'd like here?

10:40.917 --> 10:43.280
Uh, just me. That's all.

10:43.635 --> 10:45.043
It's just the two of us.

10:45.915 --> 10:49.221
We each come from a long line
of homophobes and bigots.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.800
The closet reflex dies hard.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.752
How long have you two been together?

10:54.756 --> 10:56.680
It's been over 15 years now.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.931
We found each other late.

10:59.356 --> 11:00.982
He thought no one would ever love him,

11:00.988 --> 11:04.840
and I'd already resigned myself
to being a lonely old drag queen.

11:05.538 --> 11:09.602
In the right light, he looks like
Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve.

11:09.605 --> 11:11.010
To you, maybe.

11:11.116 --> 11:13.392
Now I look more like Mrs. Doubtfire.

11:13.436 --> 11:17.222
I'll let you two talk, and I'll be back
as soon as I know anything, okay?

11:20.078 --> 11:21.383
Hey, Luka.

11:21.386 --> 11:23.832
Can you sign a wrist X ray order
for the Obama lady?

11:23.836 --> 11:24.830
Sure.

11:25.328 --> 11:27.112
I hear the baby's doing well.

11:27.498 --> 11:30.501
- He's starting to hold his head up.
- Ah, that's great.

11:31.906 --> 11:34.530
You know, we never got to talk
about everything that happened.

11:34.535 --> 11:35.992
It's not your fault, Sam.

11:36.006 --> 11:39.392
- If it wasn't for me...
- If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

11:40.007 --> 11:41.320
How is everything?

11:43.215 --> 11:44.242
It's good.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.190
You know, pretty good. I, uh...

11:47.295 --> 11:50.212
Alex is seeing this shrink lady,
but he's not really into it.

11:50.706 --> 11:52.610
You know how he is.
He keeps everything bottled up...

11:52.615 --> 11:54.030
I meant with you.

11:54.507 --> 11:56.900
I'm fine. Really.

11:58.788 --> 12:00.743
You want me to try talking to Alex?

12:00.747 --> 12:03.502
No. You've got enough on your plate.

12:04.037 --> 12:05.873
- But thank you.
- Sam, hey.

12:06.478 --> 12:08.563
Just don't beat yourself up.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.953
You did what you had to do.
It was self-defense.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.502
Born in a poor village in central Guatemala,

12:15.507 --> 12:19.160
Soledad Gutierrez is a deeply devout
immigrant who works cleaning houses.

12:19.167 --> 12:21.601
She's had a hard time adjusting
to life in the U.S.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.242
Wow, you really bonded with her.

12:23.248 --> 12:25.781
Okay, Felicity, come on, hurry up
and get to the point, will ya?

12:25.788 --> 12:27.540
Soledad is worried every day

12:27.547 --> 12:29.960
and prays all the time for her husband
and four-year-old son

12:29.965 --> 12:34.053
back in their hometown of...
"Chichicastenango."

12:34.455 --> 12:39.382
Oh, sure I got down to Chichi for
el dia de los muertos back in '96.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.583
Still, there's no denying that.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.840
...of the boy, but she's getting older
now and might not be able to...

12:43.845 --> 12:45.183
Look, look, look, look.

12:45.666 --> 12:47.402
I don't need her whole life story.

12:47.405 --> 12:49.191
Why is she in the ER today?

12:50.347 --> 12:54.671
Well... she had a great-uncle
who died of a heart attack.

12:54.675 --> 12:57.193
His wife and children were left
without anyone to care for them,

12:57.195 --> 12:59.490
so they actually had to move in with
her parents, which was weird, because...

12:59.495 --> 13:01.210
All right, stop, stop, stop.

13:02.128 --> 13:03.860
What brought her to the ER?

13:05.008 --> 13:06.312
Her heart.

13:06.315 --> 13:07.462
- It's her heart.
- Good.

13:07.467 --> 13:10.670
So do you think it's an MI?
Pericarditis? Dysrhythmia?

13:12.795 --> 13:17.201
Well, she's been unable to find
a suitable church,

13:17.208 --> 13:20.210
so I believe that she feels
so alone in this world

13:20.218 --> 13:24.350
that her heart is aching
for her family and her homeland.

13:24.708 --> 13:29.070
Okay, okay, well, diagnostically,
what you just said is nothing.

13:29.077 --> 13:31.670
- Need a hand here!
- Group home resident, 23 years old.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.330
Release me, you merchants of destruction!

13:34.776 --> 13:37.573
- You need to stay in bed, Ernie.
- Good to see you.

13:37.928 --> 13:39.383
Pleasure's all mine.

13:40.328 --> 13:42.682
The home thinks he might have
ingested something.

13:43.218 --> 13:46.593
All right, ten of Haldol
and two of Ativan I.M.

13:46.598 --> 13:48.761
Oh, this is Rodney King all over again.

13:48.765 --> 13:51.640
- Hey, lady, no pictures in here.
- You ain't fooling nobody, brother.

13:51.646 --> 13:54.290
- Harriet, get back to your bed.
- Obama going to see this.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.692
How you feeling, Mr. Anderson?

14:01.447 --> 14:02.623
Better.

14:04.008 --> 14:05.651
Tell him he can go.

14:06.007 --> 14:07.471
He's got a show tonight.

14:07.475 --> 14:11.123
We're having a fund-raiser for
the Chicago HIV-AIDS Coalition.

14:11.126 --> 14:13.812
And I don't want you missing it
on account of me.

14:14.107 --> 14:15.962
He never misses a show.

14:17.588 --> 14:20.350
All right, listen,
we have some test results

14:20.356 --> 14:22.750
and the good news is,
you did not have a heart attack.

14:22.757 --> 14:24.080
Oh, thank God.

14:24.276 --> 14:26.971
But you're not making urine,
which means your kidneys aren't working

14:26.978 --> 14:29.031
so you'll have to go on dialysis.

14:29.698 --> 14:31.190
I don't think so.

14:31.195 --> 14:32.460
- Jim...
- It's pretty urgent.

14:32.777 --> 14:34.502
I've been to enough doctors already.

14:34.505 --> 14:37.050
I've had enough tubes and machines
and treatments.

14:37.056 --> 14:38.581
No, I'm not going to do it.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.340
- Don't ask me...
- It's okay, Jim. It's okay.

14:42.225 --> 14:45.400
So what else can we try?
What are his other options?

14:45.597 --> 14:47.083
His options?

14:48.327 --> 14:50.951
He'll die. Very soon.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.930
- No, it's enough already.
- Jim, there's no choice.

14:57.935 --> 15:00.220
Dialysis can substantially
prolong your life.

15:00.705 --> 15:02.520
I've already got the bad heart.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.472
I'm sick of being sick.

15:04.477 --> 15:07.361
I'm not going to be
some broken-down cripple.

15:07.368 --> 15:09.270
You're tired, I know that...

15:09.278 --> 15:11.570
- But remember what we always said--
- It's enough, it's enough.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.373
- Whatever's going to happen...
- You choose more life

15:13.375 --> 15:15.423
- no matter what, remember?
- I don't want to do this to you.

15:15.427 --> 15:18.423
More life, no matter what.

15:18.915 --> 15:20.862
You promised.

15:31.807 --> 15:33.080
Okay.

15:33.688 --> 15:36.183
But you've got to do something for me.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.982
Call Lorraine, and tell her
what's going on.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.870
- Jim...
- Call her.

15:42.955 --> 15:45.192
Just tell her to bring the boy.

15:45.807 --> 15:47.343
I want to see him.

15:48.366 --> 15:49.913
It's not a good idea.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.833
Don't get into it all.

15:52.315 --> 15:54.323
Don't try to explain it.

15:54.326 --> 15:58.000
Just tell her I want to see them.

15:58.008 --> 16:00.091
It's been too long.

16:01.677 --> 16:03.602
Please, Benny.

16:03.608 --> 16:06.511
You... you got do...

16:07.246 --> 16:08.470
Okay.

16:17.407 --> 16:19.002
His sister and her son.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.021
I've never met them.

16:23.718 --> 16:25.091
So, dialysis?

16:25.096 --> 16:26.880
Yeah. Let's get him up
as soon as we can.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.152
I'll make the call.

16:31.087 --> 16:34.180
He was already 50 by the time
he figured it out.

16:34.626 --> 16:38.131
He wanted to tell his family,
but they shut him down.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.323
So he just left.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.622
Disappeared one day.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.553
Found me.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.780
No openings now.
I told them we could start him down here.

16:49.787 --> 16:51.512
His Serum K level is still high.

16:51.515 --> 16:56.060
All right, amp of bicarb, 25 grams of D50,
ten units of regular insulin.

17:02.608 --> 17:03.833
May I use that phone?

17:03.836 --> 17:06.359
Sure. There's one down the hall
if you want more privacy.

17:06.367 --> 17:07.632
Thank you.

17:09.007 --> 17:10.092
Oh, excuse me.

17:10.096 --> 17:13.221
Gates, rheumatology came down
on your polymyositis patient

17:13.228 --> 17:14.492
and there was no H and P on the chart.

17:14.494 --> 17:15.720
Didn't get to it yet.

17:15.728 --> 17:17.800
No, that's not good enough.
Sam, you got this?

17:17.817 --> 17:19.522
- You come with me.
- All right.

17:19.525 --> 17:21.573
Give me an ETA on the dialysis.

17:22.046 --> 17:24.282
Listen, I've got enough problems
without you pissing off

17:24.287 --> 17:26.321
the other departments by not keeping
current on your charts.

17:26.326 --> 17:28.230
- I'm just trying to use my time well.
- No, not well enough.

17:28.234 --> 17:29.532
Get that up to date.

17:29.535 --> 17:31.351
Oh, thank God,
someone who understands this game.

17:31.358 --> 17:33.741
- Rough morning, Greg?
- I'm glad to have you on the floor.

17:33.745 --> 17:35.972
Dr. Pratt, will you come check
my vertical mattress?

17:35.975 --> 17:37.642
I think I everted the edges too much.

17:37.647 --> 17:39.782
Not until he listens
to my bronchiolytic.

17:39.787 --> 17:40.980
You try a neb yet?

17:40.985 --> 17:42.540
Don't worry, I'll show you.

17:42.548 --> 17:44.781
Uh, I'm with Dr. Pratt today.

17:44.786 --> 17:46.111
Okay.

17:46.505 --> 17:48.661
And I still need to present
my barbell-on-the-toe guy.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.620
Well, I can help you with that.

17:52.418 --> 17:55.910
Hey, guys, this is the esteemed
Dr. Weaver in the house, okay?

17:55.916 --> 17:57.681
So take advantage-- present to her.

17:57.686 --> 18:01.450
- Soak up all her decades of experience.
- Decades? What am I, a fossil?

18:02.005 --> 18:04.650
All right, go, run and hide, all right?
We'll be in there in a minute.

18:04.657 --> 18:06.602
You know what, I'm fine.

18:06.727 --> 18:09.590
I'll push charts, help clear some beds.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.581
- I hope this isn't awkward.
- What?

18:11.588 --> 18:14.481
- That you and I are equals now?
- I guess.

18:14.587 --> 18:17.221
Hector Rodriguez, 38, found down
on the sidewalk.

18:17.225 --> 18:19.110
Hey, there's Tony... Tony man!

18:19.117 --> 18:22.392
- Cue Ball, what are you doing here?
- Some kind of misunderstanding.

18:22.397 --> 18:24.033
- History of ETOH.
- Yeah, we know.

18:24.038 --> 18:25.781
- Did you vomit any blood?
- Not this time, bro.

18:25.788 --> 18:28.692
I was just sleeping
and some skank called 911.

18:28.697 --> 18:30.251
- Where do you want him?
- Did you fall?

18:30.256 --> 18:31.910
No, no, that's old.

18:32.105 --> 18:33.971
A junkie rolled me
a couple of weeks ago.

18:33.977 --> 18:35.703
Occupational hazard.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.062
- Get this dude to Exam Three.
- I got him. I know him.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.061
Check a crit and look for signs
of occult trauma.

18:41.067 --> 18:42.772
- Yes sir, Dr. Pratt.
- I can get him.

18:43.006 --> 18:44.193
You finish that.

18:45.556 --> 18:47.401
Is that the bleeding heart of Jesus?

18:47.408 --> 18:48.713
Sure is.

18:49.707 --> 18:51.212
Isn't God great?

18:51.408 --> 18:53.652
You ain't so bad yourself, honey.

18:58.007 --> 19:02.081
There are no open spots upstairs,
so we're starting him on dialysis here.

19:03.117 --> 19:05.271
Is that Uncle Jimmy in there?

19:09.428 --> 19:10.881
Hello. Lorraine?

19:11.375 --> 19:13.252
You're the man I talked to on the phone?

19:13.257 --> 19:14.663
Bennett Cray.

19:15.377 --> 19:19.062
My brother Harold and my son Brian.

19:19.477 --> 19:21.111
James asked you to call us?

19:21.115 --> 19:22.830
He wanted to see his family.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.591
Now, like this?

19:26.648 --> 19:28.621
That's par for the course, I guess.

19:29.807 --> 19:31.521
He's having ectopy.

19:31.526 --> 19:34.361
Damn it. Get Gates and Pratt in here.
His K's going up again.

19:35.005 --> 19:36.922
Ejection fraction is ten percent.

19:37.188 --> 19:38.412
What does that mean?

19:38.606 --> 19:40.650
It means his heart's not pumping
well enough.

19:40.968 --> 19:42.490
Does he have an advanced directive?

19:42.496 --> 19:43.600
You mean like a DNR?

19:43.605 --> 19:45.401
No. I talked to the other doctor about this.

19:45.407 --> 19:47.350
Why are you asking about a DNR?

19:47.925 --> 19:50.270
We need to know how far
he'd want us to go.

19:50.275 --> 19:52.102
- Whatever you can do.
- We knew he was sick, but...

19:52.106 --> 19:54.251
I talked to him on the phone.
He said he was having...

19:54.325 --> 19:58.312
problems with his diabetes and having some
trouble with his congestive something.

19:58.317 --> 19:59.642
He called you?

20:00.235 --> 20:03.291
- In June, when I graduated.
- What are his chances?

20:05.007 --> 20:07.222
Well, it's possible
if we put him on dialysis,

20:07.225 --> 20:09.350
- and avert a cardiac incident...
- Can he take all that?

20:09.385 --> 20:11.990
He's very resilient.
He's been through a lot.

20:11.998 --> 20:13.102
He's been sick for years.

20:13.106 --> 20:15.611
He's not the type to want
to be kept alive on machines.

20:15.835 --> 20:18.720
Your brother and I have discussed
these matters quite a bit.

20:18.726 --> 20:20.462
Look, we need a few minutes
to figure this out.

20:20.466 --> 20:21.223
Sure.

20:21.227 --> 20:24.290
Maybe I can be of some help.
Jim and I are good friends.

20:24.296 --> 20:26.243
We've been working together
for quite awhile now.

20:26.248 --> 20:28.180
Thank you.
This is a family matter.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.351
We appreciate all you've done.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.182
We'd like some privacy now.

20:37.187 --> 20:40.681
Oh, yes, all right, I'll...
I'll just step outside.

20:40.718 --> 20:43.143
- QRS complex is widening.
- Ready to start the run.

20:43.148 --> 20:44.721
Wait a minute, hold on.

20:45.237 --> 20:46.220
Sam.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.653
Where the hell is Gates,
and why is this chart blank?

20:50.655 --> 20:53.343
He goes fast. He probably fills out
the paperwork later.

20:53.345 --> 20:55.780
You got this guy's meds
in your nursing notes?

21:00.308 --> 21:03.402
Okay, amp of calcium chloride.

21:03.407 --> 21:05.192
- We doing this?
- In a minute.

21:05.385 --> 21:07.442
I'm going to give him calcium
to stabilize his heart.

21:07.447 --> 21:09.632
Once we do that,
we'll figure out what's next.

21:09.637 --> 21:10.760
Okay.

21:13.226 --> 21:16.251
Hey, Haleh, can you pass me a head sheet
and a three-pack of Vicodin?

21:16.256 --> 21:18.073
I'm getting him started
on something for the pain.

21:18.075 --> 21:20.382
Sorry. We got rid of head sheets
about a year ago.

21:20.388 --> 21:23.412
And we're not allowed to dispense meds
from the ER anymore.

21:23.955 --> 21:26.900
So what's a patient supposed to do
if they can't get to a pharmacy?

21:26.908 --> 21:28.681
You are preaching to the choir, sister.

21:28.686 --> 21:30.810
I liked it better when you ran the joint.

21:35.617 --> 21:37.463
- Charged.
- Clear.

21:38.897 --> 21:41.390
Still v fib.
Resuming compressions.

21:43.005 --> 21:44.791
- What happened?
- Amp of epi.

21:44.796 --> 21:45.983
Why isn't he dialyzed?

21:45.986 --> 21:48.692
QRS widened, we gave him calcium,
now he's crashing.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.410
- Is-Is-Is my uncle dying?
- What's that alarm?

21:51.415 --> 21:52.571
It's time for his meds.

21:52.578 --> 21:56.121
He gets afternoon doses of Glyburide,
Lasix and Didge.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.803
What? Did you say Didge?

21:58.807 --> 22:02.881
Digoxin. 0.25 milligrams.
It's right here.

22:03.827 --> 22:06.782
Okay, can everybody step back for a minute
while we work on him, please?

22:06.788 --> 22:08.633
Charge to 360 again.

22:08.955 --> 22:10.851
You help my brother with his medications?

22:10.857 --> 22:12.020
Sometimes, yes.

22:12.027 --> 22:14.391
No one said anything about Didge.
You showed me Diovan, Sam.

22:14.397 --> 22:17.042
- That's what I was told.
- By who? The paramedic?

22:20.907 --> 22:22.523
What's Zadro's sheet say?

22:23.787 --> 22:24.871
Digoxin.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.910
- You don't look at his med bottles?
- We didn't have them yet.

22:28.277 --> 22:29.052
Here's the deal--

22:29.058 --> 22:31.532
he has high levels of intracellular
calcium from the Didge,

22:31.536 --> 22:33.062
and I pushed a whole bunch more--

22:33.067 --> 22:34.681
enough to stop his heart-- why?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.511
Because you couldn't slow down enough
to read the med sheet right.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.153
Can you tell me what's going on?

22:42.808 --> 22:46.060
The drugs we gave him to treat
his QRS has irritated his heart.

22:46.607 --> 22:48.180
Clear. Clear

22:50.438 --> 22:54.423
- No change.
- Uh, so what now? What else can we do?

22:55.107 --> 22:56.672
What about Digibind?

22:57.506 --> 23:00.621
Depends on his DNR status.
Have you all come to a decision?

23:03.536 --> 23:05.583
We've decided it's enough now.

23:05.907 --> 23:07.940
- It's time to let him go.
- What? No.

23:07.945 --> 23:09.051
Our brother's an old man.

23:09.056 --> 23:11.953
- He's been very sick for a long time.
- No, no, no. He wants to fight.

23:11.956 --> 23:14.012
- He's got no one to look after him.
- He has friends,

23:14.018 --> 23:17.151
- he has a support system.
- And who's gonna take care of him, you?

23:17.156 --> 23:19.363
- I always have.
- But we're his blood,

23:19.366 --> 23:22.180
and we don't think he'd want to suffer
through all this for a little extra time.

23:22.188 --> 23:24.442
Well, you don't know that, because
you don't know him, but I do.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.970
- And that was his choice, not ours.
- I know him, I live with him. I...

23:26.978 --> 23:28.480
...love him.

23:30.305 --> 23:31.760
I love him.

23:35.097 --> 23:37.752
I asked you once politely to go.

23:37.905 --> 23:39.860
You have no part in this.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.690
We could treat your brother
with something called Digibind.

23:46.697 --> 23:48.823
It'll give him a fighting chance. Pratt.

23:49.098 --> 23:50.573
He's been in arrest for seven minutes.

23:50.578 --> 23:53.811
His heart isn't salvageable.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cray, but...

23:54.506 --> 23:57.053
- this is what his family wants...
- Please, wait.

23:57.328 --> 24:01.130
We'll continue CPR as long as there's hope
for a meaningful recovery, but...

24:03.925 --> 24:06.201
You can all come closer
if you'd like to be with him.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.121
Call it in five minutes.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.040
Excuse me.

24:24.028 --> 24:25.272
I'll be right back.

24:28.407 --> 24:30.902
Hey, we caused this to happen.

24:30.905 --> 24:34.381
- No, you caused this to happen.
- All right, so give me a shot at fixing it.

24:34.386 --> 24:35.742
You're never gonna save him.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.411
The family are not the caretakers here--

24:37.417 --> 24:39.821
- ...that man is.
- There's no living will, no durable power.

24:39.828 --> 24:41.843
- You gotta go with the blood relatives.
- We have a chance.

24:41.845 --> 24:45.063
- This is a teaching hospital.
- Teach me.

24:45.146 --> 24:48.553
Oh, you want to learn. Okay.
Well, here you go--

24:48.655 --> 24:50.183
that man's gonna die.

24:50.185 --> 24:53.333
That's what needs to happen right now.
So forget about the Digibind.

24:53.766 --> 24:58.263
Lidocaine, one more round of epi and then
you can pronounce him. Understood?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.661
You need a break?

25:21.245 --> 25:22.273
Sure.

25:24.908 --> 25:29.231
All right, 100 of lidocaine,
get ready for some more epi.

25:29.865 --> 25:31.273
And, uh...

25:34.667 --> 25:36.353
ten vials of Digibind.

25:36.607 --> 25:38.160
Wait, I thought the other doctor said...

25:38.165 --> 25:41.262
Your brother expressed a clear
desire for resuscitation earlier.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.710
This is a fixable condition,
we're gonna give it a go.

25:44.307 --> 25:45.792
Did you discuss this with Pratt?

25:45.798 --> 25:47.762
Yes. We discussed it.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.343
Am I going blind?

25:59.347 --> 26:00.950
Oh, bless your heart.

26:00.957 --> 26:03.832
First thing-- check the intra-ocular
pressure with a Tonopen.

26:03.837 --> 26:06.851
- I'm not sure how to use that.
- All right, I'll be right back.

26:12.507 --> 26:16.033
- So how's that new intern doing?
- She's very, uh... devoted.

26:16.036 --> 26:19.341
Diligent, inquisitive,
likes to discover new things--

26:19.346 --> 26:22.321
all attributes I like in a newbie. Ugh.

26:22.326 --> 26:24.122
God, you're disgusting.

26:24.945 --> 26:25.991
Who left this here?

26:25.998 --> 26:27.660
- Ray.
- Whoa, what?

26:27.665 --> 26:30.013
If I get a page, I got less than
five minutes to get on the roof.

26:30.018 --> 26:31.582
Where's the Tonopen?

26:31.655 --> 26:33.342
Had two stolen, wound up on eBay.

26:33.347 --> 26:35.431
JAY-CO makes us lock everything up now.

26:35.507 --> 26:38.401
Syringes, eye drops,
even Quaiac Developer.

26:38.516 --> 26:41.811
- Only Attendings get a key.
- I am an Attending.

26:42.287 --> 26:44.143
Make sure you check under the hood.

26:47.398 --> 26:51.382
Hey, look... is there any rule about
desk clerks dating doctors?

26:51.797 --> 26:54.241
Shut up, Not-Jerry.
I got dibs.

26:54.428 --> 26:56.391
Oh, sweet.

26:56.758 --> 26:58.363
There's a pile-up in Northbrook.

27:00.107 --> 27:01.692
I am so out of here.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.023
Let's see what we got.

27:06.705 --> 27:07.981
Sinus tach at 110.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.790
- Got a pulse with that?
- Strong carotid.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.843
Excellent.
Cycle the Dynamap.

27:12.706 --> 27:14.070
We got him back for now.

27:14.107 --> 27:15.062
Jimmy...

27:15.498 --> 27:16.890
I'm right here, Jimmy.

27:17.258 --> 27:18.983
BP's 105 over 62.

27:18.987 --> 27:21.733
That's good enough for dialysis.
Get the tech back down here.

27:22.657 --> 27:25.103
Mr. Cray, there are
two friends of yours here.

27:25.465 --> 27:27.220
Would you tell them
I'll be out in a minute.

27:34.747 --> 27:36.293
Uh, they work with us.

27:37.968 --> 27:40.830
Our brother was a lot more screwed-up
than we realized.

27:41.028 --> 27:44.952
- I'm sorry he never told you.
- We knew he was an oddball, anti-social.

27:44.955 --> 27:48.863
We thought he just fell into some sad,
lonely life. We never realized he was...

27:49.968 --> 27:51.212
- a degenerate.
- Harold...

27:51.215 --> 27:53.033
He's not a degenerate.

27:53.295 --> 27:54.632
And his life hasn't been a waste.

27:54.638 --> 27:56.703
I know it would be easier for you
to believe that.

27:56.787 --> 28:00.022
- He lied to us for years.
- He didn't want to--

28:00.025 --> 28:02.493
he didn't see any other way.

28:02.496 --> 28:04.270
You need to go now.

28:04.275 --> 28:06.001
I'm not going anywhere.

28:06.006 --> 28:07.950
You want to take care of him?!
Fine.

28:07.957 --> 28:10.181
It doesn't have to be like this.

28:10.187 --> 28:12.363
We need another doc in here,
this guy is crashing!

28:12.368 --> 28:17.383
All right, call for a vent.
100%, AC 14, tidal volume 600.

28:17.387 --> 28:19.091
Yo, Cue Ball, what's up?

28:20.927 --> 28:22.480
Oh, that didn't sound good.

28:22.858 --> 28:23.872
Pressure dropped to 80.

28:23.875 --> 28:28.283
All right, normal saline wide open,
five liters O2.

28:28.905 --> 28:30.071
What is she doing?

28:30.407 --> 28:31.963
I think it's the 23rd Psalm.

28:32.307 --> 28:34.011
- He doesn't have a line.
- Why doesn't he have a line?

28:34.017 --> 28:35.673
Will you stop that, please?

28:35.908 --> 28:39.350
His vitals were stable, crit's 32.
His only complaint was shoulder pain

28:39.356 --> 28:41.050
- and the x-ray was negative.
- Wait, wait, calm down, calm down.

28:41.055 --> 28:42.473
- Did you just say shoulder pain?
- Yeah.

28:42.478 --> 28:43.993
Type and cross four units.

28:44.397 --> 28:45.441
What happened?

28:45.447 --> 28:49.330
Alcoholic with distant trauma history
presents with shoulder pain and hypotension.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.390
Prep the belly for ultrasound.

28:58.106 --> 28:59.862
I thought you said you were coming alone.

28:59.868 --> 29:04.402
- Oh, come on, it's me-- Uncle Archie!
- Oh, he's so cute.

29:04.407 --> 29:05.772
He looks more like Kovac.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.593
They say they usually look more
like the father in the beginning.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.601
It's nature's way of making sure daddy doesn't
get all insecure and club us both to death.

29:12.608 --> 29:15.492
Can I hold him?
Sure, he wants me to hold him.

29:15.496 --> 29:18.362
Oh, a little spit-up there.
No problem.

29:18.366 --> 29:20.202
Whoa... little bit more.

29:20.206 --> 29:23.660
- I missed this part with my kids.
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

29:23.725 --> 29:26.100
I was going stir crazy in the apartment,
so I thought I'd take a walk

29:26.105 --> 29:27.992
and try paging you.
How's surgery?

29:27.997 --> 29:30.822
Well, I thought it would be nice
to get back to work, and

29:30.825 --> 29:35.051
distract myself from stuff, but my new
chief is such rectal tissue, it's all misery.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.473
Okay, you better take him.
It's starting to get gross.

29:37.475 --> 29:40.082
- Thanks a lot, Morris.
- Here you go.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.010
So, are you loving motherhood?

29:44.107 --> 29:47.092
Yeah, it's a... it's bizarre.

29:47.197 --> 29:49.190
- Sore nipples?
- Shut up.

29:51.225 --> 29:53.202
- Oh, I think he's hungry.
- Yeah, maybe.

29:53.265 --> 29:54.892
Oh, damn it.
I've got to get back.

29:54.895 --> 29:58.972
- Well, thank you for coming.
- Well, it's very nice to see you.

30:00.337 --> 30:02.053
And nice to see you.

30:02.126 --> 30:05.982
- And, uh, call me if you need anything.
- Okay. I'll be back to work next month.

30:06.777 --> 30:10.190
- Okay, I think I need to feed him.
- Yeah, I'm down with that.

30:10.195 --> 30:13.110
Breast feeding is a beautiful, natural
thing, nothing to be ashamed of...

30:13.115 --> 30:15.052
You're not sneaking a peek at my tits,
Morris.

30:21.408 --> 30:24.701
- Come on, Mr. Rodriguez, wake up.
- Got a 14 gauge in the right wrist.

30:24.708 --> 30:27.613
You got a 14 gauge in?
Gonna have to teach me that one.

30:28.047 --> 30:29.190
This the ruptured spleen?

30:29.228 --> 30:30.383
Foley's in.

30:31.398 --> 30:33.602
- Who's touching my dick?
- Ah, not me, Cue Ball.

30:33.605 --> 30:35.452
That was only one time
when I was extremely lonely.

30:35.456 --> 30:37.383
It's a catheter, Mr. Rodriguez.

30:37.546 --> 30:38.861
Abdomen's flat.

30:38.865 --> 30:40.501
Pressure's up to 100 systolic.

30:40.508 --> 30:43.110
Hey... angel face.
What's going on?

30:43.115 --> 30:44.583
I'd like to ditto that--
what is going on?

30:44.588 --> 30:46.573
I thought we were going upstairs, no?

30:46.576 --> 30:49.222
Dr. Gates discovered that
there was some internal bleeding.

30:49.225 --> 30:51.421
- Based on Kehr's sign.
- You caught that?

30:51.488 --> 30:55.770
That's my boy. Everybody knows,
you be tripping on some fent-laced powder.

30:55.775 --> 30:58.453
Tony's the one you want pushing that Narcan.

30:58.506 --> 31:02.281
- High praise indeed.
- Check him out now with his fancy MD.

31:02.288 --> 31:03.590
Chest sounds clear.

31:03.988 --> 31:06.121
- What do you think you're doing?
- Examining him.

31:06.125 --> 31:07.703
Yeah, it's a little crowded.

31:07.708 --> 31:09.122
Step back.
Write up the H & P.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.592
- Well, I can't do that unless...
- I will dictate to you.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.083
Chest clear...

31:17.107 --> 31:20.083
Cardiac S1, S2 without murmur,
rub or gallop.

31:20.085 --> 31:21.560
Am I going too fast for you?

31:23.407 --> 31:25.950
Hey, I heard Faith's guy was crashing.

31:25.957 --> 31:27.292
Her name is "Hope."

31:27.376 --> 31:28.550
I think it's okay.

31:28.868 --> 31:31.283
Good. Well, we're done in there.
You guys called it?

31:31.706 --> 31:34.042
Uh, no, actually.
The Digibind worked.

31:38.078 --> 31:39.683
Neela, check a quick rectal.

31:39.807 --> 31:41.202
You want me to do the rectal exam?

31:41.207 --> 31:43.322
What part of "no Digibind"
did you not get?

31:43.325 --> 31:44.881
- It worked.
- So what?

31:44.886 --> 31:46.851
You got his heart back,
but his brain is shot.

31:46.908 --> 31:49.203
Now he'll be comatose in the ICU
for three weeks

31:49.208 --> 31:52.371
- until every one of his organs fail.
- You don't know that for sure.

31:52.885 --> 31:55.482
- What'd you just say to me?
- I'm an intern, not an idiot, all right?

31:55.488 --> 31:57.042
- I've been patching up guys from...
- Then maybe next time

31:57.047 --> 31:59.772
you'll know the difference
between diovan and Didge.

31:59.777 --> 32:02.560
..if what I'm told doesn't make sense
to me, you got that?

32:03.248 --> 32:06.922
I've been in this ER for five years
working my way up as an Attending,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.962
so if you think that
you're gonna stand there

32:08.967 --> 32:10.850
and spout some crap like that to me,

32:10.856 --> 32:13.000
oh, then we got a lot more to talk about.

32:15.178 --> 32:16.641
Now get the hell out.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.240
Okay, I was out of line.
Can I just check...

32:19.246 --> 32:21.260
- Get the hell out of here, Gates!
- We're working on this guy!

32:21.267 --> 32:22.621
Not anymore.

32:22.788 --> 32:24.351
- Shift's over.
- Oh, yeah?

32:24.357 --> 32:26.670
- Pressure stable.
- OR is ready.

32:26.706 --> 32:28.972
Sats 92 on four liters.

32:29.425 --> 32:33.533
- Stool is brown, guaiac negative.
- Good, let's squeeze in two units,

32:33.535 --> 32:35.701
portable monitor, let's move him up.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.473
Thank you, Jesus.

32:51.526 --> 32:52.883
I thought you were gone.

32:53.468 --> 32:55.192
Working on my charts.

32:56.895 --> 33:00.003
So, I know I made a mistake, but
that guy would've needed calcium anyway.

33:00.726 --> 33:03.300
And if I'd known about the Didge,
I would've used a much lower dose,

33:03.307 --> 33:05.101
- pushed it very slowly.

33:05.107 --> 33:07.103
I said I was wrong--
what do you want from me?

33:07.505 --> 33:10.480
How about "I won't ever again
flat-outisregard

33:10.488 --> 33:12.702
something you tell me to do
or not do, Dr. Pratt"?

33:12.708 --> 33:14.782
He would've wanted the Digibind--
his partner wanted it.

33:14.788 --> 33:17.053
- So what?
- So what? It's got to matter.

33:17.058 --> 33:19.483
It was a judgment call
that wasn't yours to make.

33:19.488 --> 33:23.013
If you can't give way to my judgment
on a patient that I've been treating...

33:27.395 --> 33:28.291
What?

33:28.315 --> 33:29.141
No.

33:29.146 --> 33:31.402
No, no, no, go ahead,
finish the sentence.

33:31.405 --> 33:32.432
Nope.

33:33.265 --> 33:34.361
Yeah.

33:35.655 --> 33:37.650
From now on, you chart as you go.

33:37.655 --> 33:40.302
No more of this saving the paperwork
for the end of the day.

33:40.305 --> 33:42.340
And the next time you don't do
what I tell you to do,

33:42.345 --> 33:44.442
or any other Attending tells you to do,

33:44.447 --> 33:47.771
you're gonna find yourself getting
bum-rushed right out of this program.

33:51.787 --> 33:53.670
I realize I was wrong from
your point of view...

33:53.677 --> 33:54.852
From my point of view?

33:54.857 --> 33:57.222
But because of the Digibind,
that guy has a chance.

33:57.226 --> 34:00.361
You really think that you saved him,
is that what you think?

34:01.306 --> 34:03.770
Oh, then he's got to have
a corneal reflex.

34:06.205 --> 34:06.850
No.

34:06.856 --> 34:08.813
- Cold calorics?
- Absent.

34:09.706 --> 34:11.621
And negative doll's eyes, right?

34:12.726 --> 34:16.931
That means no sign of brain activity,
no chance for recovery.

34:17.235 --> 34:23.362
So as your, uh, your favorite new mentor,
let me just say, great save, Dr. Gates.

34:40.906 --> 34:42.003
Hey.

34:42.275 --> 34:43.643
How's your first day going?

34:44.335 --> 34:47.411
Guy comes in with a few scrapes,
ends up with a spleenectomy.

34:47.416 --> 34:49.092
Well, sounds like a good case.

34:49.206 --> 34:50.219
Yeah, it does.

34:50.708 --> 34:51.860
Sounded like one.

34:51.864 --> 34:54.812
Unfortunately, I wouldn't know,
because Dr. Crenshaw won't let me scrub in.

34:54.815 --> 34:56.530
Sent me to do dressing changes
on the floor.

34:56.534 --> 34:59.601
Yeah, he's a stern taskmaster,
that Dusty.

34:59.608 --> 35:01.810
I'm an intern, Lucien.

35:01.818 --> 35:03.902
Nurses do wound changes.

35:03.906 --> 35:06.011
You know what? Uh...
That's his call.

35:06.018 --> 35:08.320
You know, you assured me
this would be a step up.

35:08.325 --> 35:11.602
Two months ago, I was harvesting
saphenous veins for a CABBAGE procedure.

35:11.655 --> 35:13.360
Now I can't hold a friggin' retractor?

35:13.368 --> 35:14.471
It's only the first day.

35:14.475 --> 35:17.323
Well, why recruit me to this program
if you won't allow me to do anything?

35:17.326 --> 35:19.520
Look, he's tough, I know that,
but his methods work, okay?

35:19.525 --> 35:22.780
He needs to break you down in order
to unlearn you of your bad habits.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.470
Wha-What am I, a pony?

35:24.596 --> 35:26.942
I don't need to be broken,
and I'm not gonna learn

35:26.948 --> 35:29.193
or unlearn anything by standing out
in the hall.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.822
Neela, you're in a different culture now.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.070
This is how we...

35:33.077 --> 35:37.020
shake the E.R. out of you
and build you up again as a surgeon.

35:37.278 --> 35:40.303
Well, does it have to be so humiliating?

35:40.306 --> 35:43.560
No. It's just much
more effective that way.

36:00.805 --> 36:02.282
I was wondering where you went.

36:02.288 --> 36:04.230
Yeah, I was taken off the case.

36:04.307 --> 36:08.032
Yes, I thought I detected some tension.

36:08.907 --> 36:10.251
Where are the Andersons?

36:10.325 --> 36:12.620
Oh, they won't stay as long as I'm here.

36:13.145 --> 36:14.620
Even Brian.

36:16.248 --> 36:18.002
Well, it's nice your friends came.

36:18.436 --> 36:21.371
They want me to go to the club,
do the show.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.780
Well, you know they're gonna
move him to ICU.

36:24.786 --> 36:28.591
We won't know anything for 24 hours.
Maybe you should... go.

36:30.327 --> 36:32.560
He's not coming back from this, is he?

36:35.598 --> 36:38.141
Mr. Cray, there's something
I should tell you.

36:38.805 --> 36:42.551
You made a mistake,
got something wrong about the Didge.

36:42.555 --> 36:45.393
It contributed to his heart problems--
I've...

36:45.398 --> 36:48.861
been around hospitals long enough
to get that much.

36:50.896 --> 36:52.771
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

36:53.825 --> 36:55.300
You treated him well.

36:55.508 --> 36:56.583
Both of us.

36:56.588 --> 36:57.861
We appreciate it.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.251
Maybe they were right.

37:03.478 --> 37:05.343
Maybe he was ready.

37:06.195 --> 37:08.501
This has been coming for a long time.

37:11.758 --> 37:13.911
But here's the thing--

37:14.215 --> 37:18.931
as bad as it all may sound,
I belong to a rare tribe,

37:18.935 --> 37:22.911
constitutionally incapable
of giving up on fantasy.

37:24.008 --> 37:28.972
I can get up like a lady, and...
sell a torch song to a crowd.

37:29.555 --> 37:35.030
And I sure as hell can hold on
to the hope that maybe...

37:36.076 --> 37:39.521
somehow Jimmy's gonna be okay.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.082
You make me wish I were a drag queen.

37:46.428 --> 37:50.510
Ah, we are all liars,
just like they said.

37:51.137 --> 37:54.871
The makeup, the wig, the padded dress.

37:55.356 --> 37:58.710
All a beautiful lie we tell ourselves.

38:00.407 --> 38:02.451
But it makes us feel better.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.501
Nothing wrong with that.

38:06.506 --> 38:09.103
No. Nothing at all.

38:16.178 --> 38:17.901
Thank you, Doctor.

38:18.305 --> 38:19.370
Hope.

38:20.158 --> 38:22.123
Impacted cerumen needs a washout in one,

38:22.128 --> 38:23.602
and migraine lady needs an H and P--

38:23.638 --> 38:26.341
the abridged version, please --
in curtain four.

38:27.007 --> 38:30.843
Oh, and hey, uh... you know,
once we're done here,

38:30.846 --> 38:33.523
maybe-maybe we could go over
some procedures and stuff,

38:33.525 --> 38:37.063
help orient you... maybe over dinner.

38:37.755 --> 38:39.211
You're asking me out?

38:39.555 --> 38:42.011
No, no, not... not exactly.

38:42.016 --> 38:43.772
I mean, you know, yeah.

38:44.748 --> 38:47.003
Have you accepted Jesus in your life?

38:47.478 --> 38:49.972
Jesus in Accounting, or...?

38:51.147 --> 38:52.931
Oh. Yeah, well, sure.

38:52.936 --> 38:54.360
Yeah, I mean, I've thought about it.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.440
- You haven't, have you?
- Yes, yes, I have.

38:56.447 --> 38:59.862
Jes-Jesus is totally... cool.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.780
I mean, to me anyway.

39:02.767 --> 39:04.550
You should come
to my Bible group sometime.

39:04.557 --> 39:05.953
I think you'd really like it.

39:06.398 --> 39:07.513
Bible group?

39:07.645 --> 39:08.661
Okay.

39:08.718 --> 39:11.830
Great. Next one's Wednesday night.

39:11.836 --> 39:13.030
Wednesday.

39:15.685 --> 39:16.983
Bible group.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.261
That... that's hot, right?

39:20.607 --> 39:24.602
Trust me, carrot boy, you ain't
anywhere near tapping that.

39:24.956 --> 39:27.540
You know, if there's...
anything you need...

39:27.727 --> 39:31.452
I mean, if I can help make your adjustment
smoother... in any way...

39:31.456 --> 39:32.952
I'll let you know.

39:33.347 --> 39:35.403
Um... things are a bit complicated
right now.

39:35.635 --> 39:37.112
Yeah, for me, too.

39:37.525 --> 39:39.921
But maybe we can... get some...

39:39.926 --> 39:41.391
- Coffee.
- Coffee, something...

39:41.395 --> 39:43.822
- ...sometime.
- Coffee would be good.

39:52.347 --> 39:53.470
Okay, then.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.312
Good... good night.

40:02.237 --> 40:03.092
Hey, kiddo.

40:03.097 --> 40:03.991
Hey, Mom.

40:05.086 --> 40:07.983
I, uh, talked to Dr. Alice today.

40:07.986 --> 40:09.851
She said you were quiet.

40:12.437 --> 40:13.801
Do you not like her?

40:18.417 --> 40:19.440
Scoot.

40:24.966 --> 40:26.693
Now, you been through a lot, you know.

40:26.695 --> 40:27.950
We both have.

40:28.778 --> 40:31.042
I just wanted you to have her to talk to.

40:31.978 --> 40:33.211
I can't.

40:34.007 --> 40:35.072
Yeah, you can--

40:35.077 --> 40:36.940
- that's what she's there for.
- No, Mom, I can't.

40:40.698 --> 40:41.822
I saw.

40:43.647 --> 40:46.621
You know,
Dad on the ground just sleeping.

40:47.126 --> 40:48.942
I saw what you did.

40:56.508 --> 40:57.871
Did you remember the wine?

40:59.646 --> 41:01.933
I knew there was a reason
I let you live here.

41:02.207 --> 41:04.452
So, were you the best one there?

41:04.676 --> 41:06.652
How many people did you save ?

41:06.766 --> 41:08.122
Did you rock?

41:25.608 --> 41:31.361
# You're nobody till somebody loves you #

41:33.517 --> 41:39.332
# You're nobody till somebody cares #

41:41.827 --> 41:45.722
# You may be king #
# You may possess #

41:46.798 --> 41:48.810
# The world and all of its gold. #

41:49.776 --> 41:54.030
# But gold won't bring you happiness. #

41:54.037 --> 41:57.410
# When you're growing old. #

41:57.806 --> 42:03.690
# The world is still the same. #
# You'll never change it. #

42:05.308 --> 42:12.512
# As long as the stars shine above. #

42:13.178 --> 42:20.993
# You're nobody till somebody loves you #

42:21.155 --> 42:25.092
# So find yourself somebody. #

42:25.546 --> 42:29.651
# Get yourself somebody. #

42:29.658 --> 42:37.183
# Find yourself somebody to... love. #

42:42.037 --> 42:46.663
