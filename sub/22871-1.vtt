01:01.853 --> 01:06.149
It all keeps us separate,
distant from ourselves.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.528
We're all wearing
masks, and don't even realize it.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.824
It's a natural defense
of our subconscious.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.786
What a sad veil we all wear...

01:18.787 --> 01:20.246
Will we ever wake up?

01:21.122 --> 01:23.583
Take off the mask's and
realize who we really are?

01:24.834 --> 01:28.670
Is it possible one day decades from now,
that we could share a common belief?

01:29.088 --> 01:31.091
A purpose…

01:31.341 --> 01:33.341

good of the people in this city.

Every year my Aunt, my Uncle
would take us to a book store...

04:02.909 --> 04:08.122

bravest man in the world…

04:16.797 --> 04:18.466
I saw him get really scared.

04:19.007 --> 04:25.056
It was a fantastic Lemonade
stand we had every summer.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.998
We would set this up and we made
the absolute worst lemonade!

We could all see the
Lemonade stand and taste

04:40.810 --> 04:43.157
it from her description,
excellent job!

04:43.908 --> 04:45.159

she never picked us up.

05:59.525 --> 06:03.196
Get in the car boys!
I said get in the car!

06:03.571 --> 06:05.740
She said she wanted to go for
a ride in the Country.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.452
We drove for about an hour
and a half.

06:11.162 --> 06:15.833

08:04.759 --> 08:08.689
a personal side of their life,
you can only thank them.

08:12.409 --> 08:16.329
As actors we have to be able to tap
into these emotions from our own life.

08:16.530 --> 08:19.984
And intertwine them with
the character that we

08:19.996 --> 08:23.461

I went to the window asked for his license
and registration.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.225
- And he wouldn't
role down the window.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.019
So I asked him again…

10:47.229 --> 10:49.315
License, registration?
He didn't do it.

10:51.569 --> 10:55.946
He reaches underneath his legs,
with the glare, what it looked like…

10:56.030 --> 10:58.590
- You thought it was a gun?
- I thought it was a gun, so I fired.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.369
Did he live? -Oh yeah nothing
happen to him thank God!

11:03.120 --> 11:06.165

couple of weeks.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.090
So ah, why did you want to become a lawyer?

11:14.548 --> 11:18.427
Well I think your case is a
a perfect example.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.347
There was a kid on the block his
name was Freddy and…

11:21.724 --> 11:26.145
He was a great kid, he was a dork
he wasn't one of the cool kids.

11:27.271 --> 11:32.400
He was chasing after the girls
and none of them wanted him.

11:32.828 --> 11:36.780
But he was harmless. They always say that.
“he's harmless he would never hurt anyone.”

He wouldn't he was
a really good kid.

11:38.932 --> 11:42.016

couple of blocks from where we were.

11:42.201 --> 11:43.703
Freddy matched the description…

11:43.936 --> 11:45.037
…So the cops just hauled him off.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.631
He had no attorney, he had no
money

11:46.774 --> 11:48.263
he ended up coping a plea
even though he didn't

11:48.275 --> 11:49.558
do it even after hours
of interrogation…

11:49.675 --> 11:52.676
Which is another thing, I know
you have to do that..

11:52.870 --> 11:56.963
But imagine your a sixteen year old,
Freddy was younger than that he was 13.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.344
Imagine being 13 and a bunch of dudes
just grab you and say, ”you did this”

12:02.391 --> 12:06.685
they stared him right in the face,
and he coped to it and went down

was there for him!

And we were walking to school and walking
through the park, that gnats were out

43:13.057 --> 43:17.811
It was slightly humid, and something
just flew by me really quickly

43:18.178 --> 43:20.663

43:21.238 --> 43:24.891
She says… it's a Rhopalocera

43:25.027 --> 43:27.000

43:27.246 --> 43:29.907
She said it means Butterfly…

43:31.025 --> 43:34.228
She said it was her favorite
because it reminded her of me.

43:34.587 --> 43:38.874
Because in Native American my name
means Butterfly.

a lot from a butterfly,

you can watch them
they're so graceful…

you should try to be like them.

realized what she meant.

I mean first butterflies
don't live that long.

Really it's the fact that in order to be
happy in life you've got to be graceful,

44:09.779 --> 44:14.698

what life is gonna give you.
