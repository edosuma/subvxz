<i>Ned: Thank you all for coming.</i>

00:33.977 --> 00:36.345
Now, let's start with the
words everyone loves to hear:

00:36.413 --> 00:38.781
"welcome to bible study!"

00:38.849 --> 00:40.516
Today, my readin'
ribbon's smack-dab

00:40.584 --> 00:41.917
In the middle of matthew 23.

00:41.985 --> 00:45.955
Now let us download the
holy tweet of the lord.

00:46.023 --> 00:47.990
Stop making this relatable.

00:48.058 --> 00:49.725
Hey, as a youth,

00:49.793 --> 00:52.194
If I don't hear a computer
word every couple sentences,

00:52.262 --> 00:53.929
I am outta here.

00:53.997 --> 00:55.631
Duly noted.

00:55.699 --> 00:58.167
But we will make sure not
to dilute the sacred gospel.

00:58.235 --> 01:00.569
Mousepad! Double click! Skype!

01:00.637 --> 01:02.571
Skype!

01:02.639 --> 01:03.906
(clears throat)

01:03.974 --> 01:05.574
Matthew 23:

01:05.642 --> 01:07.877
"then spake jesus to the multitude,

01:07.944 --> 01:10.146
And to his disciples, saying..."

01:10.213 --> 01:13.049
Homer: Hey,
my bathing suit came off!

01:13.116 --> 01:15.384
Whoo!

01:15.452 --> 01:16.919
Whoa!

01:16.987 --> 01:18.621
Hey, it floats!

01:18.689 --> 01:20.690
(sighs) I'll handle this.

01:23.994 --> 01:26.562
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

01:26.630 --> 01:27.997
(ringing) (homer cheering)

01:29.299 --> 01:30.766
(groans)

01:30.834 --> 01:32.101
Homer simpson.

01:32.169 --> 01:34.103
You are the most infuriating,

01:34.171 --> 01:37.173
Netflix dvd-burglaring,
barbecue-not-putting-out...

01:37.240 --> 01:40.042
(hooting)

01:40.110 --> 01:41.310
...Man I ever met!

01:41.378 --> 01:43.045
Hold that thought.

01:43.113 --> 01:45.014
Oh!

01:45.082 --> 01:47.483
That man is beyond redemption.

01:47.551 --> 01:49.885
That might seem to be true...

01:49.953 --> 01:51.654
I sense a "but" coming, reverend...

01:51.722 --> 01:54.123
Homer: Here comes the butt!

01:54.191 --> 01:57.693
But I think you're up
to the challenge, ned.

01:57.761 --> 01:59.929
Oh, reverend, I've been
working my bible to the bone

01:59.996 --> 02:01.464
Trying to save that man.

02:01.531 --> 02:04.400
You know, ned, god has
never given up on anyone.

02:04.468 --> 02:05.835
What about sodom and gomorrah?

02:05.902 --> 02:07.703
He lovingly destroyed them.

02:07.771 --> 02:09.505
Instead of pushing homer away,

02:09.573 --> 02:13.542
Can't you find a way to
reach out and bring him in?

02:20.350 --> 02:24.186
(chanting)

02:31.461 --> 02:32.595
Homer?

02:32.662 --> 02:34.096
Homer?

02:34.164 --> 02:35.331
(clears throat)

02:35.399 --> 02:36.899
You know, our bible study group

02:36.967 --> 02:39.802
Is going to the holy
land next month.

02:39.870 --> 02:43.172
I'd like you and your
family to come as my guests.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.007
Hmm, let me think...

02:45.075 --> 02:47.610
Take my family to a war zone

02:47.677 --> 02:50.246
On a bus filled with
religious lame-os

02:50.313 --> 02:52.648
In a country with no pork

02:52.716 --> 02:56.419
In a desert with no casinos...

02:56.486 --> 03:01.223
Ooh, where do I sign up?

03:01.291 --> 03:04.226
Homer, I can hear your sarcasm
from inside the house.

03:04.294 --> 03:06.028
And the dishwasher's on!

03:06.096 --> 03:07.363
What's going on here?

03:07.431 --> 03:09.398
Mr. Flanders invited us to israel.

03:09.466 --> 03:11.333
I think he wants to
get dad into heaven.

03:11.401 --> 03:13.936
Great. More hell for me.
(bart and homer laugh)

03:14.004 --> 03:17.940
Ned flanders, you would take
our family to the holy land

03:18.008 --> 03:20.776
Just to try to make my
husband a better man?

03:20.844 --> 03:24.013
Yep. I also want to try
something called "pita bread."

03:24.080 --> 03:26.248
Well, we will take
you up on your offer.

03:26.316 --> 03:27.683
Oh...

03:27.751 --> 03:29.218
But we insist on
paying our own way.

03:29.286 --> 03:30.820
Oh!

03:30.887 --> 03:32.621
And homer, put on some pants.

03:32.689 --> 03:34.457
(screaming) oh!

03:34.524 --> 03:37.026
The man hates pants.

<i>All: L'chaim!</i>

03:51.029 --> 03:53.230
Homie, just tell them
what they want to hear.

03:53.298 --> 03:54.032
I can't!

03:54.200 --> 03:55.967
Latkes aren't as good
as american pancakes.

03:56.535 --> 03:57.802
(groans)

03:57.870 --> 03:59.637
They're okay with applesauce.

03:59.705 --> 04:01.506
True enough.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.375
(grunts)

04:04.443 --> 04:08.880
A truckload of applesauce! Eh...

04:12.451 --> 04:14.452
Krusty, I've been meaning to ask.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.353
What are you doing on this tour?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.956
I believe that every jew
should make a pilgrimage

04:19.024 --> 04:20.992
To israel before he dies.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.427
Yes, it is fitting.

04:22.494 --> 04:23.594
(laughs)

04:23.662 --> 04:25.196
Don't want to end up in hell.

04:25.264 --> 04:26.431
Jews don't believe in hell.

04:26.498 --> 04:27.665
No hell?

04:27.733 --> 04:29.867
Thank you, kid. You made my day.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.043
(fiddle playing)

04:42.414 --> 04:44.515
You're being paid to
clean the gutters!

04:48.921 --> 04:51.155
This country's so historic.

04:51.223 --> 04:54.926
For all we know,
jesus could have given a talk

04:54.993 --> 04:56.394
In conference room c.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.295
Man: Welcome, welcome!

04:57.362 --> 04:58.863
(clears throat)

04:58.931 --> 05:00.798
My name is jacob.

05:00.866 --> 05:04.368
You may notice I speak the
english with a slight accent.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.504
This is because,
as you have probably guessed,

05:06.572 --> 05:08.272
I used to live in london,

05:08.340 --> 05:10.108
And that is why I
sound like hugh grant.

05:11.510 --> 05:13.111
Come on. Let's go.

05:13.178 --> 05:15.046
We've got a lot of holy
sites to see. Yallah!

05:15.114 --> 05:16.614
We finish early,

05:16.682 --> 05:18.516
We go to jewelry store
owned by my cousins.

05:18.584 --> 05:19.917
(all laughing)

05:19.985 --> 05:21.719
No joke. Is true. Great prices.

05:21.787 --> 05:23.955
You got to haggle.
Otherwise they don't respect you!

05:24.022 --> 05:25.056
Come on. Let's go!

05:25.124 --> 05:26.824
Do you have any safety tips?

05:26.892 --> 05:28.226
What are you talking about?

05:28.293 --> 05:30.428
Israel is the safest
country in the world.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.997
The only danger
here is dehydration.

05:33.065 --> 05:35.099
Drink water. Don't die.
Looks bad on me.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.901
Come on. Shut your face. Let's go.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.636
But it says here in the brochure...

05:38.704 --> 05:40.438
Brochure? Brochure?

05:40.506 --> 05:42.740
Brochure? Who wrote your brochure?

05:42.808 --> 05:45.009
The same schmuck who
wrote the new testament?

05:45.077 --> 05:46.611
I can't talk to you.

05:46.678 --> 05:47.879
You talk to my niece, doreet.

05:47.946 --> 05:49.547
Doreet, talk to the stupids.

05:49.615 --> 05:50.982
Shalom, goyem!

05:51.049 --> 05:52.583
Shalom to you!

05:52.651 --> 05:55.820
Shalom is the "aloha"
of this place.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.789
Okay, okay, lady.
You done talking now?

05:57.856 --> 06:00.324
Who is licensed tour
guide here, you or me?

06:00.392 --> 06:02.627
Now, everybody,
we have no time to see masada.

06:02.694 --> 06:04.796
Everybody died there for nothing.

06:04.863 --> 06:06.697
Okay, first stop: Old city.

06:06.765 --> 06:08.633
Come on. Let's go.
Please shut your face!

06:08.700 --> 06:10.301
(gasps): The old city.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.937
Where b.C. Turned into a.
D.! Let's go!

06:13.005 --> 06:15.573
Flanders, that stuff's been
here for thousands of years.

06:15.641 --> 06:17.642
But the breakfast
buffet at our hotel,

06:17.709 --> 06:19.243
Which is included in our package,

06:19.311 --> 06:20.945
Closes in ten minutes!

06:21.013 --> 06:23.281
Homer, that's not why we're here.

06:23.348 --> 06:25.216
We can see the
stations of the cross.

06:25.284 --> 06:28.186
After we see the stations
of the omelet bar.

06:28.253 --> 06:29.654
(groans)

06:29.721 --> 06:32.356
Okay, let's just put it to a vote.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.726
I can't believe we lost, reverend.

06:35.794 --> 06:37.528
Mm-hmm.

06:37.596 --> 06:39.197
These blueberry muffins are bigger

06:39.264 --> 06:40.865
Than the ones we had at pechanga.

06:40.933 --> 06:44.268
Finally, something you
like better than pechanga.

06:47.739 --> 06:50.741
Okay, everybody. Please
shut your face. Here we go.

06:50.809 --> 06:53.911
This sacred spot on mount
zion is king david's tomb.

06:53.979 --> 06:55.780
Also, where your jesus,

06:55.848 --> 06:57.748
Who was a native-born israeli,
by the way--

06:57.816 --> 06:59.183
Sandals, circumcised,

06:59.251 --> 07:01.252
Perfect english accent,
the whole deal...

07:01.320 --> 07:03.221
This is where he
had his last supper

07:03.288 --> 07:04.989
Before they took him away

07:05.057 --> 07:06.757
And hammered him up on that cross.

07:06.825 --> 07:08.693
(laughing)

07:08.760 --> 07:10.828
Hey, you. You're not part
of the group. No listening!

07:10.896 --> 07:13.197
Hey, is israel. Is free country.

07:13.265 --> 07:15.533
(yelling in hebrew)

07:20.606 --> 07:21.572
(continues yelling)

07:30.582 --> 07:31.883
Okay, that's it.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.318
Because of him,
no armenian quarter.

07:34.386 --> 07:35.720
Forget it. It's gone.

07:35.787 --> 07:38.589
All thanks to mr. Listen-for-free.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.524
Lord, please help homer

07:40.592 --> 07:44.862
Experience the redemptive
power of this sacred land.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.530
He's going for the record.

07:46.598 --> 07:47.765
He's going for the record!

07:50.535 --> 07:52.803
Flanders, you're not
supposed to help him.

07:52.871 --> 07:54.906
Yeah, thanks a lot, flanders.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.607
(sighs)

07:56.675 --> 07:58.376
Homer, do you think you could show

07:58.443 --> 08:00.945
Just the slightest
bit of reverence?

08:01.013 --> 08:03.447
Ned, I'm an american tourist.

08:03.515 --> 08:06.484
I'm just here to see some sights,
try goofy new food

08:06.551 --> 08:10.087
And spread some shekels with my
carolina panthers credit card.

08:10.155 --> 08:11.822
Panthers!

08:11.890 --> 08:14.725
Could you at least
turn the camera off?

08:14.793 --> 08:18.062
If you say it like dracula, I will.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.064
Homer... Please, please, please...

08:20.132 --> 08:21.499
Bleh!

08:21.566 --> 08:23.034
(laughing)

08:23.101 --> 08:25.269
That is going right
on stupidflanders.Org.

08:25.337 --> 08:27.905
You know, homer,
you might really benefit

08:27.973 --> 08:31.842
From opening your heart to the
spirituality of this place.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.443
Please, neighbor?

08:33.511 --> 08:35.246
This really means
a lot to you, huh?

08:35.313 --> 08:37.914
Yes, but it means more to you.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.017
Boy, are you lousy
at reading minds.

08:40.085 --> 08:41.552
Okay, okay.

08:41.620 --> 08:44.255
For you, I'll try.

08:44.323 --> 08:48.159
<i>Flanders: Lord, I think I may
have finally reached him...</i>

08:49.995 --> 08:52.763
Flanders (on recording):
Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!

08:52.831 --> 08:54.632
Homer, quit playing that back.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.934
I'm not. It's my ring tone.

08:57.002 --> 08:58.169
Yello. This is he.

08:58.236 --> 08:59.904
Yeah, I wanted to know:

08:59.972 --> 09:02.440
Do you deliver falafels
to the top of mount zion?

09:02.507 --> 09:04.642
Great. I'd like a large falafel

09:04.710 --> 09:06.644
With pepperoni, sausage,
and extra cheese.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.512
Yes, I know what a falafel is.

09:08.580 --> 09:09.613
(sighs)

09:13.258 --> 09:15.058
<i>This, eh... Everybody,
look at my face.</i>

09:15.526 --> 09:18.828
This is the western,
or as you say, wailing wall.

09:18.896 --> 09:21.531
It is believed that the
lord will grant the prayers

09:21.599 --> 09:23.266
That are stuck into the cracks.

09:23.334 --> 09:26.603
Please, no graffiti,
no making the pishen. Yallah.

09:26.671 --> 09:29.806
"dear lord: Please fix the
following parking tickets:

09:29.874 --> 09:32.442
"a647253,

09:32.510 --> 09:36.046
"sp90325,

09:36.113 --> 09:39.482
Shelbyville 932871..."

09:41.185 --> 09:42.919
Sad.

09:42.987 --> 09:44.487
Sad.

09:44.555 --> 09:46.356
Never gonna happen.

09:46.424 --> 09:48.091
Sad.

09:48.159 --> 09:49.726
Maybe, if you were brad pitt.

09:49.794 --> 09:51.094
Hey, boy, we're supposed
to be acting religiousy.

09:51.162 --> 09:52.862
What are you up to?

09:52.930 --> 09:55.532
Reading prayers and ignoring them,
just like god.

09:55.599 --> 09:57.600
Hey, this one's from you.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.436
"dear lord,
don't let marge find out

09:59.503 --> 10:02.605
The hotel leaves chocolates
on the pillows at night."

10:02.673 --> 10:03.807
Why, you little...

10:03.874 --> 10:06.509
(choking)

10:06.577 --> 10:08.478
"give my dad another
heart attack?!"

10:08.546 --> 10:10.747
(shouts)

10:16.754 --> 10:19.422
Smite him like the
firstborn of egypt.

10:19.490 --> 10:23.093
Dead baby, dead baby, passover,
dead baby, dead baby...

10:44.548 --> 10:46.750
(man crying prayer call)

10:48.819 --> 10:50.587
Hey, why am I running from a girl?

10:50.654 --> 10:53.022
Call me when you're old
enough for your bat mitzvah.

10:53.090 --> 10:54.758
I'll bring you an
envelope full of nothin'.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.059
(grunts)

10:56.127 --> 10:57.594
Karate!

10:57.661 --> 10:58.962
Krav maga!

10:59.029 --> 10:59.996
Krav ma-wha?

11:00.064 --> 11:01.464
Israeli karate.

11:01.532 --> 11:03.066
Less hyah,

11:03.134 --> 11:04.434
More hyah

11:04.502 --> 11:05.769
Ha-mee-ha-gee!

11:05.836 --> 11:06.436
(grunts)

11:08.205 --> 11:09.639
(grunting)

11:09.707 --> 11:11.241
You don't fight like a girl.

11:11.308 --> 11:12.642
Or even a milhouse.

11:12.710 --> 11:14.344
<i>I don't know what is "milhouse."</i>

11:14.412 --> 11:15.512
(grunting)

11:15.579 --> 11:17.514
I work security for the tour.

11:17.581 --> 11:19.449
Dealing with american
punks like you

11:19.517 --> 11:21.184
Counts as my military service.

11:21.252 --> 11:23.052
<i>And we know all about you.</i>

11:24.255 --> 11:25.955
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

11:26.023 --> 11:28.224
Hey, is that the ark
of the covenant?

11:29.093 --> 11:30.059
(grunting)

11:30.127 --> 11:31.161
Karate!

11:31.228 --> 11:34.631
Once again, krav maga!

11:34.698 --> 11:36.666
(grunting)

11:36.734 --> 11:38.168
Quit going for my groin!

11:38.235 --> 11:39.836
No groin, no krav maga.

11:41.472 --> 11:43.072
Hello, groin.

11:45.309 --> 11:46.810
(speaks hebrew) come on, come on!

11:46.877 --> 11:49.312
Everybody finish lemon ice-
not allowed inside.

11:50.848 --> 11:53.550
Before us stands the church
of the holy sepulchre,

11:53.617 --> 11:56.586
Believed to be the home
of the tomb of your lord.

11:56.654 --> 11:59.155
Or as he's known here,
"the man in the underpants."

11:59.223 --> 12:00.457
<i>Beautiful tachtoonim.</i>

12:00.524 --> 12:01.658
Oh, what abs!

12:01.725 --> 12:03.326
He was a real good-looking one.

12:03.394 --> 12:05.829
Nice hair. Conditioner? I think so.

12:05.896 --> 12:08.064
And, lord, thank you
for letting me see

12:08.132 --> 12:10.533
This wonderful place where
the end of the world

12:10.601 --> 12:12.135
Will soon begin.

12:12.203 --> 12:14.838
And thank you again for the
challenge of homer simpson.

12:14.905 --> 12:16.573
We've all got our crosses to bear.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.309
Me homer, you... The cross.

12:19.376 --> 12:21.678
And now, let me gaze with reverence

12:21.745 --> 12:23.246
Upon the holy resting place that...

12:23.314 --> 12:24.647
(snoring) (yells)

12:24.715 --> 12:26.149
(mutters): Uh, wha...?

12:26.217 --> 12:28.852
Homer, this is the most sacred spot

12:28.919 --> 12:31.554
In christendom,
not your backyard hammock!

12:31.622 --> 12:33.022
I'm sorry.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.525
It's just that these
tours are so exhausting.

12:35.593 --> 12:37.894
You're jet-lagged.
You're walking around all day.

12:37.962 --> 12:41.030
It's so hard to sleep
knowing marge and the kids

12:41.098 --> 12:43.266
Are all stuck in one
small room, and...

12:43.334 --> 12:45.134
It's so nice and cool

12:45.202 --> 12:47.837
In the tomb of the
unknown savior. Unknown?!

12:47.905 --> 12:50.607
This is the tomb of the most
famous man who ever lived!

12:50.674 --> 12:51.741
Porky pig?!

12:51.809 --> 12:53.376
Porky pig's not a man!

12:53.444 --> 12:56.513
He's a pig, and he's
not even a real pig!

12:56.580 --> 12:59.349
<i>But he is buried here, right?</i>

12:59.416 --> 13:01.584
That's it! I'm losing it!

13:01.652 --> 13:03.720
I'm losing it! You come all the way

13:03.787 --> 13:05.688
To jerusalem,
the happiest place on earth,

13:05.756 --> 13:08.925
And all the photos in your
camera are of funny soda pops?!

13:08.993 --> 13:09.826
(groans)

13:09.894 --> 13:11.027
Oh, will you...

13:11.095 --> 13:12.262
You are such a...

13:12.329 --> 13:13.596
Ah!

13:13.664 --> 13:16.065
(chuckles): Chickpea fizz!

13:16.133 --> 13:18.268
Delete. Delete. Delete.

13:18.335 --> 13:19.769
<i>Whatever. It's your camera.</i>

13:19.837 --> 13:20.937
(screams)

13:21.005 --> 13:22.138
(grunts)

13:22.206 --> 13:24.207
(grunting, thumping)

13:24.275 --> 13:25.508
(grunts)

13:27.978 --> 13:29.879
Please, you've got
to let me back in.

13:29.947 --> 13:32.348
I sold 6,000 rolls of
wrapping paper to get here.

13:32.416 --> 13:33.383
<i>That's your problem.</i>

13:33.450 --> 13:34.951
You, my friend, are banned

13:35.019 --> 13:36.653
From ever entering
this church again.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.520
(slams door)

13:37.588 --> 13:39.756
B-banned for life?

13:39.823 --> 13:42.292
Homer, do you know
why I'm a christian?

13:42.359 --> 13:43.760
Your parents made you?

13:43.827 --> 13:46.195
It's because I believe every soul

13:46.263 --> 13:48.331
Has the possibility of salvation.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.867
At least I thought so till now.

13:50.935 --> 13:54.837
Homer simpson,
you are not worth saving.

13:54.905 --> 13:58.341
What? But I thought we'd
be neighbors in heaven.

13:58.409 --> 14:00.476
Goofing on all the new
dead people. Not...

14:00.544 --> 14:02.912
Worth... Saving!

14:02.980 --> 14:04.981
Homer: Ned! Ned, wait up!

14:10.354 --> 14:11.621
(gasps)

14:11.689 --> 14:13.756
Ned's run off into the desert!

14:13.824 --> 14:15.024
Aha!

14:15.092 --> 14:18.294
A sand horse-- car of the desert!

14:25.336 --> 14:26.502
(camel grunting)

14:32.910 --> 14:34.444
Mmm!

14:34.511 --> 14:36.479
Nothing like a tall
glass of lukewarm water

14:36.547 --> 14:39.582
(wind whooshing) to
jekyll down this hyde.

14:39.650 --> 14:41.618
Ooh, looks like a
sandstorm's brewing.

14:41.685 --> 14:43.920
I'll just wait it out at a movie.

14:47.591 --> 14:48.558
Orthobot prime,

14:48.626 --> 14:51.127
The battle begins!

14:51.195 --> 14:54.297
Not so fast-- we can't
transform on the sabbath!

14:54.365 --> 14:58.134
Let us power down and
contemplate the torah.

14:58.202 --> 15:00.737
(mechanical whirring)

15:00.804 --> 15:03.473
(robots praying)

15:05.809 --> 15:09.245
<i>(orchestral theme from lawrence
of arabia playing)</i>

15:09.313 --> 15:11.147
Flanders!

15:11.215 --> 15:13.583
Stupid flanders!

15:13.651 --> 15:15.585
(wind whooshing)

15:15.653 --> 15:18.721
(grunting, spitting)

15:18.789 --> 15:22.225
Oh! There's sand in my shoe, too!

15:22.292 --> 15:24.594
(relieved sighs): Oh! Oh...!

15:24.662 --> 15:25.828
Oh.

15:25.896 --> 15:28.531
(camel grunting)

15:28.599 --> 15:31.968
Good luck surviving without me!

15:32.036 --> 15:34.404
<i>(to lawrence of arabia theme):
¶ thirsty ¶</i>

15:34.471 --> 15:37.507
¶ I am so thirsty ¶

15:37.574 --> 15:41.644
¶ and hungry and horny ¶

15:41.712 --> 15:45.982
¶ but mostly just thirsty ¶

15:46.050 --> 15:49.252
¶ I am so thirsty ¶

15:49.319 --> 15:51.020
Huh?

15:51.088 --> 15:52.488
(gasps): Water!

15:55.125 --> 15:56.959
(hoarsely): Oh! So salty!

15:57.027 --> 16:00.663
Maybe if I add a little salt.

16:10.441 --> 16:12.842
(wind whistling)

16:18.015 --> 16:20.316
(sobbing)

16:20.384 --> 16:23.319
(sobbing loudly)

16:23.387 --> 16:24.353
(stops sobbing)

16:24.421 --> 16:25.354
(resumes sobbing)

16:28.726 --> 16:30.727
You have been chosen, homer.

16:30.794 --> 16:33.296
Chosen for what, o mighty gherkin?

16:33.363 --> 16:36.199
Rise and listen, my child.

16:36.266 --> 16:39.635
Yours is a great destiny.

16:39.703 --> 16:41.637
Pickle, carrot, tomato, pickle,

16:41.705 --> 16:43.039
Carrot, tomato, pickle, carrot,

16:43.107 --> 16:44.540
Tomato, pickle, carrot, tomato...

16:46.777 --> 16:49.679
Oh, homie, you're alive!

16:49.747 --> 16:52.648
I am more than alive, woman.

16:52.716 --> 16:54.751
I am the chosen one

16:54.818 --> 16:57.820
Who shall unite all the
faiths of the holy land!

16:57.888 --> 17:01.023
I am... The messiah!

17:01.091 --> 17:03.226
But you still have
our passports, right?

17:03.293 --> 17:04.727
Oh, yeah.

17:04.795 --> 17:06.996
Got to keep track of those.

17:07.064 --> 17:08.998
(shouts): The messiah...

17:09.066 --> 17:10.833
(normal voice): Has the passports.

17:13.404 --> 17:16.906
Dad, are you okay?
I am more than okay!

17:16.973 --> 17:19.742
I am the messiah,
come to save the world!

17:19.810 --> 17:21.577
Look upon me and shudder!

17:21.645 --> 17:22.779
I already do that.

17:22.846 --> 17:24.781
Uh... Messiah?

17:24.848 --> 17:27.817
Do you mind if I have a word
with your wife? As you wish.

17:27.885 --> 17:29.752
But look not upon her with lust,

17:29.820 --> 17:31.687
And do not send her
friendly e-mails.

17:31.755 --> 17:33.322
That's how it begins.

17:33.390 --> 17:34.557
(chuckles)

17:36.060 --> 17:37.827
Homer is suffering
from what's called

17:37.895 --> 17:39.429
"jerusalem syndrome."

17:39.496 --> 17:41.664
Ah, yes, jerusalem syndrome:

17:41.732 --> 17:43.966
The name given to religious
delusions or psychoses

17:44.034 --> 17:46.069
That occur when people
visit jerusalem.

17:46.136 --> 17:49.172
Have you ever noticed that
dad always gets the disease

17:49.239 --> 17:51.274
They write about in the
in-flight magazine?

17:51.341 --> 17:52.608
Marge: Oh, my god!

17:52.676 --> 17:53.943
Homer's gone!

17:55.079 --> 17:56.179
(groans)

17:56.246 --> 17:58.114
What's he gonna do now?

17:58.182 --> 18:01.884
Hmm, dad said he was going
to unite all faiths.

18:01.952 --> 18:05.822
And only one site is sacred to muslims,
christians and jews:

18:05.889 --> 18:06.989
The dome of the rock!

18:07.057 --> 18:08.324
Dome of the rock?

18:08.392 --> 18:09.659
Messiah away...!

18:09.726 --> 18:12.195
(grunts)

18:12.262 --> 18:15.498
(gasps): This one says
"carolina panthers"!

18:15.566 --> 18:18.101
Messiah says "rowrr!"

18:18.168 --> 18:21.471
Jacob: (speaks hebrew) okay,
everybody, come on.

18:21.538 --> 18:23.239
This shrine contains the rock

18:23.307 --> 18:26.008
On which abraham was going
to sacrifice his son.

18:26.076 --> 18:28.578
And muslims believe something, too.

18:28.645 --> 18:30.646
To find out,
hire a muslim tour guide.

18:30.714 --> 18:31.981
<i>That's a barrel of laughs.</i>

18:32.049 --> 18:33.749
Anyway, shut your face.
Thanks, thanks.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.818
You can stop giving the tour now.

18:35.886 --> 18:38.721
You don't want to do a photo with me?
You can hold my gun.

18:38.789 --> 18:41.891
I used it in entebbe.
I killed three ugandans. No, thanks.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.759
Before you go in,

18:43.827 --> 18:45.094
You fill out comment card.

18:45.162 --> 18:46.262
(groans): Okay.

18:48.899 --> 18:50.700
Uh, eh, don't forget the back.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.502
You people are so pushy.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.504
What, israeli people are pushy?

18:54.571 --> 18:56.906
How about you experience
a couple of genocides

18:56.974 --> 18:58.608
<i>And see how laid-back you are?</i>

18:58.675 --> 19:01.144
We were purged from Spain!
Throw out of there!

19:01.211 --> 19:03.146
They allow everybody in Spain!

19:03.213 --> 19:05.915
But for us, jews,
no flamenco, get out!

19:05.983 --> 19:07.717
I'm pushy? Please.

19:07.784 --> 19:09.218
You stay there,

19:09.286 --> 19:11.787
Surrounded by your
great enemy, canada!

19:11.855 --> 19:15.258
Try syria for two months,
then we'll see who's pushy!

19:17.127 --> 19:20.830
<i>Attention, christians,
muslims, and jews:</i>

19:20.898 --> 19:23.299
I have come to gather
you into a new faith.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.535
From now on, you shall be called...

19:25.602 --> 19:27.570
Chrismujews.

19:27.638 --> 19:29.472
(unenthusiastic murmuring) man:
I-I don't know.

19:29.540 --> 19:33.543
Because when you get down to it,
aren't all religions the same?

19:33.610 --> 19:35.444
They tell you what to eat,

19:35.512 --> 19:36.812
When to pray,

19:36.880 --> 19:39.115
How this imperfect
clay that we call man

19:39.183 --> 19:42.151
Can mold itself to
resemble the divine.

19:42.219 --> 19:44.387
But we can never attain
that ultimate grace

19:44.454 --> 19:47.089
While there is hatred in
our hearts for each other.

19:47.157 --> 19:48.291
(quietly): I did it.

19:48.358 --> 19:49.559
I reached him.

19:49.626 --> 19:51.394
Celebrate your commonality.

19:51.461 --> 19:53.229
Some of us don't eat pork.

19:53.297 --> 19:55.598
Some of us don't eat shellfish.

19:55.666 --> 19:58.467
But all of us love chicken.

19:58.535 --> 19:59.902
(excited murmuring) man:
He's right!

19:59.970 --> 20:01.637
<i>You can simmer it in a tagine.</i>

20:01.705 --> 20:03.406
In a soup, you can boil it!

20:03.473 --> 20:04.674
Spread the word!

20:04.741 --> 20:07.143
Peace and chicken.

20:07.211 --> 20:09.445
Crowd: Peace and chicken!

20:09.513 --> 20:11.581
Don't listen to this fat idiot!

20:11.648 --> 20:13.149
<i>I am your messiah!</i>

20:13.217 --> 20:16.018
Avert your eyes from
my wrinkly arms!

20:16.086 --> 20:18.854
Uh-oh. Got another case
of jerusalem syndrome.

20:18.922 --> 20:21.257
This looks like a job for...

20:21.325 --> 20:22.758
The messiah!

20:27.998 --> 20:29.465
I want the window seat!

20:29.533 --> 20:31.133
Krav maga!

20:31.201 --> 20:32.802
You can't hurt what's already dead.

20:32.869 --> 20:34.370
(grunts) (groans): I guess you can.

20:34.438 --> 20:36.672
Homer, my friend,
of all the false messiahs today,

20:36.740 --> 20:38.741
I think you came
closest to the truth.

20:38.809 --> 20:40.810
Well, if I made any sense today,

20:40.877 --> 20:43.779
It's because all the stuff
you've told me all these years

20:43.847 --> 20:45.681
Has finally seeped in.

20:45.749 --> 20:48.150
Can I buy you a $12
turkey sandwich?

20:48.218 --> 20:49.619
I'd like that.

20:49.686 --> 20:51.520
How about a greg
norman executive putter

20:51.588 --> 20:53.956
From the skymall?
You'd probably get a better deal

20:54.024 --> 20:55.291
At a mall back home.

20:55.359 --> 20:56.959
They have malls on land?

21:01.999 --> 21:03.699
<i>Jacob: Why don't you try
having your people</i>

21:03.767 --> 21:05.401
<i>Being thrown out of Spain?!</i>

21:05.469 --> 21:08.504
<i>Spain! No tapas!
I love eating tapas!</i>

21:08.572 --> 21:10.106
<i>I love the tiny portions!</i>

21:10.173 --> 21:11.841
<i>You don't get too full,</i>

21:11.908 --> 21:14.477
<i>But you have a whole
variety of flavors!</i>

21:14.544 --> 21:17.146
<i>Not for me! Every day
hummus and pita!</i>

21:17.214 --> 21:20.950
<i>Occasionally, once a week,
a little bit of falafel!</i>
