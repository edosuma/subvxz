Danny the Dog
(Unleashed)

01:22.129 --> 01:24.048
M?talos.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.108
Danny!

02:41.363 --> 02:43.202
Atta Boy.

02:44.442 --> 02:47.721
If you must money for me, one assumes
that you must pay to me.

02:47.722 --> 02:51.559
Pay I, the Collar has left position.
You do not pay to me, the Collar loosen.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.184
It is very simple.

02:53.521 --> 02:54.681
Lev?ntate.

02:55.241 --> 02:56.281
Quiet Qu?date!

02:57.400 --> 02:58.880

03:02.200 --> 03:05.081
We will be back.
Come on Danny Boy.

03:10.119 --> 03:11.680
I dreamed Last night …

03:11.680 --> 03:13.520
It was seated in a house…

03:13.520 --> 03:16.639
… Umbrella, those
in order to decorate drinks.

03:16.639 --> 03:19.840
And there was a beautiful girl
with the golden skin…

03:19.840 --> 03:23.079
… dressed only in one
short skirt…

03:23.079 --> 03:25.799
… that adjusted to its skin.

03:25.799 --> 03:28.878
And the girls went and came…

03:28.878 --> 03:32.958
… and one of them brings a drink to me.
A Coco milkshake.

03:32.958 --> 03:37.117
And as soon as it brings the drink to me, happens to me
the teats by all the face.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.037
That wonder!

03:38.357 --> 03:40.598
Hey head, seems that Georgie
he is a little excited.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.837
Shut Up Lefty, you are the one get
 the fuck enough, not me.

03:44.277 --> 03:48.236
Well, that is the aim
of the best part.

03:48.236 --> 03:51.156
After the girls, everything went
to the excrement.

03:51.276 --> 03:55.356
She appeared that Joe Mumpet with
a machine gun…

03:55.356 --> 03:57.715
… and it began to destroy it everything…

03:58.236 --> 04:01.755
… leaving not more blood and
corpses by all sides.

04:01.755 --> 04:03.395
That it dehorns!

04:03.875 --> 04:05.516
The real nightmare.

04:10.955 --> 04:13.474
Good looking that you never had
a dream truth?

04:17.434 --> 04:22.072
It must have been peaceful.
Hey, have a little this.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.153
Hatred the dreams.

04:29.073 --> 04:30.073
Hello old!

04:30.593 --> 04:32.273
Righty, bastard!

04:32.273 --> 04:33.872

04:33.872 --> 04:36.072
Hello head, all good.

04:39.312 --> 04:41.672
Head what happens to him to Danny?

04:42.392 --> 04:45.712
Ay?dalo, its face continues bleeding.
Ay?dalo.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.552
Somebody has some problem?

04:48.151 --> 04:50.752
Put everything here.
Ah, very good.

04:56.431 --> 04:58.111
We go Danny.
You already heard the head.

04:58.271 --> 05:00.230
This is its part

05:01.030 --> 05:03.190
This is for you well?

05:05.151 --> 05:06.909
They see, Danny.

05:07.149 --> 05:08.910
Danny, Come on!

06:51.740 --> 06:53.981
They see, we make a toast.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.822
That is, that is. Yes!

06:57.460 --> 06:59.740
Beautiful.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.940
Back in the car.
Stupid idiot!

07:04.180 --> 07:05.660
Fuckin one up!

07:05.660 --> 07:08.429
I want one of but close.
That is, that is.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.939
You do not put your hands in the photo.
Still she is fresh.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.219
Everything for him.

07:18.619 --> 07:20.659
- No, not here.
- Yes.

07:20.659 --> 07:23.898
Yes, you are right.
We go to a more comfortable place.

07:25.939 --> 07:27.378
He is hard.

07:30.738 --> 07:31.617
turn the lights.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.258
- Without lights.
- turn on the lights.

07:39.057 --> 07:42.417
- I like to see how making love with you
- Oh damn it.

07:47.777 --> 07:52.776

Sick Pork

07:54.416 --> 07:56.297
- To where you go?
- It vetoes to the excrement.

07:58.495 --> 08:02.496
Thanks!
Excrement.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.613
Atta Boy.

08:19.774 --> 08:22.974
- I go away.
- Hey, Natham.

08:24.853 --> 08:26.694
She is either head, is or.

08:27.413 --> 08:28.734
Is this what wants?

08:45.412 --> 08:48.292
Mant?n the ready car
and it pays attention.

08:49.051 --> 08:51.411
- Good luck.
- We did not need it, friend.

09:12.530 --> 09:16.888
Sabes what is most fascinating of
this situation, friend?

09:17.849 --> 09:22.088
That basically you have turned
to a man in a dog.

09:22.088 --> 09:24.409
Good, it is like my santa mother
it used to say…

09:24.409 --> 09:27.969
… “Ag?rralos of young people
and your possibilities are infinite. “

09:28.049 --> 09:30.528
At this moment I am
like you.

09:30.728 --> 09:34.927
Then, we are going to see if
I understand.

09:35.047 --> 09:36.567
I do not pay to you…

09:37.527 --> 09:39.647
-… and you remove the collar to him.
- Correctomundo.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.527
Him extractions the collar
and it strikes until killing.

09:42.527 --> 09:45.167
Vaya, that shining mind!

09:45.767 --> 09:48.567
Then it is of my interest
to maintain that collar on.

09:49.766 --> 09:50.887
Danny!

09:51.127 --> 09:54.606
Kill Him!

09:57.766 --> 09:59.287
Danny!

10:07.445 --> 10:10.444
When you finish with this master
kills the dog.

10:20.924 --> 10:21.803
Taste in seeing it, Mr. Youssef.

10:34.482 --> 10:36.442
M?talos!

10:39.483 --> 10:43.722
- Something Found that pleases to him.
- Not yet.

10:52.282 --> 10:53.442
Stops him!

11:15.720 --> 11:16.800
Pretty puppy.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.598
Atta Boy.

11:29.679 --> 11:31.478
Not who you are created?

11:31.878 --> 11:34.278
It seems that I was not well clear.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.639
Ll?vate which you want.

11:35.758 --> 11:38.638
No, you do not take me by one
of those pigs…

11:38.759 --> 11:40.877
… like some people
that I know.

11:41.157 --> 11:42.757
I only take what
he corresponds to me.

11:43.238 --> 11:44.958
But this time…

11:47.076 --> 11:47.997
Yes.

11:49.277 --> 11:55.836
… I am going away to take what wants.
Because your you are a damn bastard.

12:04.715 --> 12:06.155
Vamonos.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.555
- That you are watching?
- I only enjoy the spectacle.

12:11.756 --> 12:12.714
Well.

12:17.314 --> 12:19.674
Does not return to me to leave single!

12:19.674 --> 12:21.114
But you said that I had left
in the car.

12:21.154 --> 12:22.234
C?llate!

12:23.594 --> 12:25.115
Sube the car, stupid idiot!

12:33.633 --> 12:37.273
I cannot believe it! They gave one me
beating that almost kills to me…

12:37.353 --> 12:41.753
… having a dog, that it does not have
brain to protect its master.

12:41.753 --> 12:44.112
To beat to them, to bite them, to piss them…

12:44.112 --> 12:45.952
… something you had done
by the love of God.

12:45.952 --> 12:48.887
- Jesus.
- Head, that does not see itself very well.

12:51.072 --> 12:53.031
Another original thinker.

12:53.031 --> 12:54.271
Perhaps head, we would have to continue…

12:54.271 --> 12:55.151
What follows?

12:55.151 --> 12:58.551
- To the house of antiques.
- Well. We go then.

12:58.551 --> 12:59.751
Is sure that it is
well for this?

12:59.831 --> 13:04.430
If you leave to that it does not pay they turn
all in “original thinkers”

13:04.430 --> 13:06.670
Let us pass first by a pub.
I want to drink a “premium”.

13:07.271 --> 13:09.750
Judas piece of excrement!

13:16.150 --> 13:17.430
It leaves.

13:29.028 --> 13:32.588
Well, this it is the plan…

13:33.068 --> 13:37.388
… I am going to try to solve this
of a pacific and professional way.

13:37.629 --> 13:40.827
If that is not
we will have…

13:40.827 --> 13:42.268
Oye, quick attention!

13:42.268 --> 13:44.108
When it pushes east button…

13:44.108 --> 13:47.107
… this red light will begin
to blink you understand?

13:47.426 --> 13:50.067
If the red light blinks,
you enter by that door…

13:50.067 --> 13:53.426
… fast, attacking…
Saca your hands from there!

13:53.706 --> 13:55.907
And you it lets bother.

13:55.907 --> 13:59.065
If the red light blinks…
M?rame, conc?ntrate.

13:59.065 --> 14:01.146
If the red light blinks,
you enter by that door…

14:01.146 --> 14:02.666
… he is everything what you must do.
you understood?

14:02.666 --> 14:07.385
Light, door!

14:07.385 --> 14:08.305
It hears.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.664
You do not clear the eyes of the light.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.224
And you do not fail this time to me.

14:14.384 --> 14:15.905
- Georgie.
- Yes, head.

14:15.945 --> 14:17.744
- That of there Hangs.
- There above?

14:23.305 --> 14:24.184
Ready.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.664
The light Danny, the light.
Red it means enters.

14:28.664 --> 14:30.503
Understood?
We go.

15:20.459 --> 15:23.179
It seems that there is somebody here needs my aid.

15:25.179 --> 15:28.059
Hello how are you?

15:28.419 --> 15:32.698
I am only going to sharpen these pianos.
I will take two hours.

15:34.898 --> 15:36.338
If it does not bother to you.

15:41.537 --> 15:46.017
You like the pianos?
To me also.

15:46.137 --> 15:48.097
The problem is that this piano
it is a “Leka”…

15:48.097 --> 15:50.616
… and it is as if there were
bought a “Chest”.

15:51.577 --> 15:54.857
Probably it would need everything
a month to put it in conditions.

15:56.776 --> 15:59.696
You know, to sharpen pianos is
a hard work…

15:59.776 --> 16:01.456
… and my back is not
what used to be.

16:02.855 --> 16:04.816
You are making something important?

16:04.816 --> 16:07.936
Because I really need
an aid here. You can?

16:09.816 --> 16:11.215
Please?

16:13.216 --> 16:14.455
You are there still?

16:18.815 --> 16:20.334
You are there, truth?

16:22.174 --> 16:23.413
If

16:24.735 --> 16:27.494
Well. They see.

16:36.052 --> 16:39.813
You know, much people thinks that because
a piano is so great and resistant…

16:39.813 --> 16:41.572
… you can touch it of the way
that you want…

16:41.572 --> 16:43.732
… and nothing will happen to him,
but it is not thus.

16:43.812 --> 16:45.252
The pianos are like
the people…

16:45.252 --> 16:49.092
… if you treat them bad, of they desafinan.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.452
The same with a piano.

16:50.772 --> 16:52.092
I strike it and…

16:53.332 --> 16:54.812
Listening this.

16:54.891 --> 16:56.411
… it sounds like a baby crying.

16:56.651 --> 16:58.012
I am going to you to say what
I want that you do.

16:58.571 --> 16:58.971
When it says “presses”…

17:00.091 --> 17:03.491
… I want that pressures these keys
beginning by this of here…

17:03.491 --> 17:08.250
… and following towards the right.
One, two and three.

17:08.329 --> 17:09.611
You can do that?

17:10.131 --> 17:13.010
Very well, now
it puts your hand here, thus.

17:16.290 --> 17:19.450
Oh, by God! Delay a little.
You are very tense…

17:19.490 --> 17:21.328
… relajate a little. Ves?

17:21.448 --> 17:23.329
Music must float
of the piano you know?…

17:23.329 --> 17:25.209
… if it cannot float,
it cannot stay signs.

17:25.209 --> 17:26.169
Here and there.

17:26.888 --> 17:29.768
Only relajate.
There is nothing no to fear here.

17:31.609 --> 17:35.728
These ready?
It presses.

17:37.848 --> 17:42.047
More fort.
Thus, again. Well.

17:42.087 --> 17:44.568
Esc?chate. You have a great one
talent for this type of work

17:44.927 --> 17:48.487
Well, it presses again.
Presiona!

17:49.287 --> 17:54.205
Wonderful. Once again.
Ready?

17:55.927 --> 17:57.687
Presiona! Presiona!

17:57.687 --> 17:58.647
It drives the pedal.

17:58.647 --> 18:01.766
The USA your soul. It lets leave
the magic.

18:01.966 --> 18:06.126
Either, very or.
Excellent, excellent.

18:07.805 --> 18:09.205
Please, it waits for a little.

18:10.846 --> 18:17.445
- Quieres to see what we obtained?
- If.

18:17.485 --> 18:18.364
It listens to this.

18:19.884 --> 18:21.805
This is the sound or no?

18:22.444 --> 18:24.925
- Yes.
- Quieres to prove?

18:25.924 --> 18:30.084
Dame your hand.
Pon the fingers there, that is.

18:31.404 --> 18:32.604
Thus.

18:33.203 --> 18:35.003
Next shutdown:
“Carnegie Hall”.

18:37.043 --> 18:38.924
Sabes what is “Carnegie Hall”?

18:40.243 --> 18:42.362
It is a very famous place
in New York City.

18:42.362 --> 18:45.123
All the great musicians want
to touch in “Carnegie Hall”.

18:45.804 --> 18:46.962
I also wanted.

18:47.481 --> 18:50.202
When it was growing
that was my greater ambition.

18:51.122 --> 18:54.921
But never I was a good musician.

18:59.321 --> 19:03.200
- You are well.
- If.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.041
Well.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.601
As you are called?

19:09.040 --> 19:13.520
This good. I will call to you “without name”.
My name is Sam.

19:20.679 --> 19:22.319
Enchanted of conocerte.

19:24.279 --> 19:28.120
Either, very or.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.399
It tell me a thing, Mr. “without name”…

19:32.638 --> 19:35.118
I am oyendo a sound
like “click”…

19:35.159 --> 19:38.239
You hear It? Or simply it is…

19:52.837 --> 19:56.277
I am going to you to sell.
That is what I am going to do.

19:58.236 --> 20:01.236
If you are not going to do what I trained to you
in order to do so that excrement I have to you?

20:01.236 --> 20:05.275
You are not to me of any damn one
utility. That is the answer.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.516
I raised to you, I fed…

20:07.995 --> 20:09.395
… I gave a ceiling you.

20:09.395 --> 20:11.276
And I wasted my time.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.195
A effort in vain.

20:13.916 --> 20:16.596
The man who raised to you…

20:16.596 --> 20:18.914
… he is furious reason why it has received.
Mira how I am!

20:18.914 --> 20:22.035
It seems that I was in
World War I.

20:22.035 --> 20:24.914
Outside here!
Takes it to it of my Vista!

20:24.914 --> 20:26.914
We go small dog, we go.

20:27.034 --> 20:28.794
I am becoming old
for this excrement.

20:29.674 --> 20:31.554
We go dog
Entra!

20:31.554 --> 20:32.474
Entra there!

20:32.593 --> 20:35.353
- I am occupied!
- I am making It enter.

20:35.513 --> 20:38.233
- There is a type that wants it to see.
- I finish saying that I am occupied.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.553
It says that it has a proposal
of businesses for us.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.033
It said something on the spectacle
of today.

20:45.192 --> 20:47.312
- M?ndalo to carajo.
- I already did it.

20:49.393 --> 20:51.312
It is well.
D?jalo to enter.

20:52.872 --> 20:54.631
Who excrement will come to joder.

21:09.231 --> 21:10.431
Dejennos single.

21:13.029 --> 21:14.190
I listen to it.

21:14.911 --> 21:18.749
It was an impressive unfolding
of its man today in the jewelry shop.

21:18.749 --> 21:21.390
I assure to him that it was
totally justified.

21:21.390 --> 21:22.670
And surely that was it.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.630
That of the collar. Brilliant.

21:25.669 --> 21:27.389
And the object of this
conversation is…?

21:27.429 --> 21:29.270
The object of this conversation is…

21:29.270 --> 21:31.829
… that I would like to offer to him
a lucrative proposal.

21:31.830 --> 21:35.062
- So lucrative What?
- Very lucrative.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.907
Contin?o?

21:37.428 --> 21:38.388
Please.

21:41.628 --> 21:44.667
It is an entertainment that adjustment
every month for friends…

21:44.667 --> 21:46.388
… only for members,
I do not know if I explain myself.

21:48.027 --> 21:50.427
And we always walked in search
of new talents.

21:50.707 --> 21:52.627
The first fight is a test…

21:52.667 --> 21:54.547
… by that it will receive 15.000.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.946
By second, 20,000 plus
percentage of the bets.

21:56.946 --> 21:58.866
A person who receives the commissions…

21:58.866 --> 22:01.266
… and it bets to itself can
to gain means million in a fight.

22:01.747 --> 22:03.625
Clear. That in case it wins.

22:04.506 --> 22:07.426
- And to win?
- To fight until dying.

22:10.224 --> 22:13.986
Enchanted from which it has come.
Please, s?game.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.465
Where is the money?

22:17.665 --> 22:20.185
Good, the money comes later.

22:20.585 --> 22:21.945
After?

22:22.064 --> 22:24.784
After overcoming it to him,
our present champion.

22:24.784 --> 22:27.224
Invicto in 15 fights.

22:29.065 --> 22:30.783
It would like a glass of
champaigne?

22:30.783 --> 22:31.744
Is difficult, ah?

22:36.863 --> 22:37.984
M?talo.

22:52.261 --> 22:54.262
M?talo. And express
damn stupid idiot.

23:03.741 --> 23:05.901
That is my boy!

23:10.260 --> 23:14.021
- Thanks for the opportunity.
- It was a pleasure. Very impressive.

23:14.101 --> 23:18.139
- That of the collar how does?
- As my mother used to say…

23:18.139 --> 23:21.100
… ag?rralos of young people and your
possibilities are infinite.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.100
It was Jaswett that said that.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.819
Probably it listened to it
of my mother.

23:25.740 --> 23:28.020
If it needs, knows to me where
to find me.

23:28.498 --> 23:30.459
Surely that we will have it this way
again.

23:30.938 --> 23:35.459
Only that I would like that the next one
time is a little more entertained.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.458
I will see that I can do.

23:54.536 --> 23:56.577
Recuerdas that dream that you
I said had had?

23:56.657 --> 23:57.937
That of the girls.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.217
- Yes.
- Yes, it memory.

23:59.217 --> 24:02.416
Finally I understood.
Sabes who is Freud?

24:02.416 --> 24:03.856
- No
- It does not matter.

24:03.856 --> 24:09.535
Freud was a genius, and said that when
you dreamed something, that meant another thing.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.215
Yes.

24:10.215 --> 24:14.655
The girls, the islands, the drinks,
they are all symbols.

24:14.815 --> 24:16.855
What truely they represent…

24:16.855 --> 24:20.136
… it is our comfort, tranquility,
not to have preoccupations.

24:20.215 --> 24:23.975
And this type comes and us
it offers more money…

24:23.975 --> 24:25.494
… del that we could win
in 20 years.

24:25.534 --> 24:27.813
What can be clearer
that that?

24:27.813 --> 24:30.494
The dream, the money. It means
that it is hour of which retires to me.

24:30.494 --> 24:32.334
- Entiendes?
- Yes.

24:33.454 --> 24:34.894
Not more casts…

24:35.013 --> 24:36.653
… not more extorsion.

24:37.774 --> 24:39.093
I will say something to you…

24:39.773 --> 24:41.253
… I feel very well today.

24:41.933 --> 24:45.493
And I feel generous.
Danny what you want?

24:46.133 --> 24:48.852
- A piano.
- Disculpa?

24:49.813 --> 24:52.412
- I want a piano.
- A piano?

24:52.453 --> 24:53.652
By God!

24:54.251 --> 24:55.611
What so a place to have supper?

24:56.732 --> 24:58.972
- I want a piano.
- And that so a woman?

24:58.972 --> 25:02.012
- You never were with one.
- I want a piano.

25:02.892 --> 25:07.290
- Danny, you begin to get upset to me.
- I want a piano.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.650
That is what it pleases to me
of you, Danny.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.170
Four words and already you said everything.

25:18.331 --> 25:22.530
For that reason we make a good equipment.
I am the brain and you them muscles.

25:22.649 --> 25:27.769
I will say something to you, this one is going to be
a spectacular day.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.647
Vamonos!

26:14.046 --> 26:18.125
Good day young ladies.
How is this morning?

26:20.245 --> 26:25.564
They have had much patience stops
to hope to me, ladies…

26:25.603 --> 26:30.165
… asique I am going to dedicate to them
the whole day.

26:39.603 --> 26:41.124
Who is there?

26:42.084 --> 26:43.283
Are you, truth?

26:45.043 --> 26:45.922
Yes.

26:46.283 --> 26:47.682
That is good.

26:49.562 --> 26:53.162
You know, the other day when I returned
to house I told of you Victory…

26:53.362 --> 26:57.162
… she is my hijastra. I told everything him on you.

27:41.878 --> 27:46.677
Hello? You still do not say to me that
you are sleeping.

27:58.636 --> 28:03.421
Good, if I awoke
in one stranger marries…

28:03.796 --> 28:06.836
… using the pajamas of another person…

28:06.836 --> 28:08.756
… he would be quite nervous…

28:08.756 --> 28:13.115
… and it would try to hide to me in
place more surely than found.

28:14.115 --> 28:19.355
When he was young, the place more surely
of the world to hide to me it was…

28:20.035 --> 28:21.475
… just there where you are now.

28:22.155 --> 28:24.194
Feels well surely there, truth?

28:24.835 --> 28:29.274
I thought that if a person is two days
without eating one would awake very hungry…

28:30.594 --> 28:32.634
… asique I brought a little to you
jam and mantequilla.

28:33.834 --> 28:35.434
My name is Sam you remember?

28:37.393 --> 28:38.393
Tomato your time.

28:38.833 --> 28:41.874
Neither Victory nor I will do to you
questions…

28:41.954 --> 28:43.952
… because we think that when
be ready…

28:44.433 --> 28:46.193
… you will give the answers us.

28:46.753 --> 28:48.113
Is well?

28:53.232 --> 28:54.552
It is well

29:55.068 --> 29:56.187
Hello!

29:59.547 --> 30:00.547
He is pretty.

30:00.547 --> 30:01.307
You create?

30:01.347 --> 30:02.585
I like his cut of hair…

30:02.667 --> 30:04.946
… it seems when it was six years old
and it cut the hair to me i myself.

30:04.946 --> 30:06.867
-, Yes good…
- You did not say that he was so pretty.

30:06.867 --> 30:07.786
It is not six years old.

30:07.786 --> 30:09.546
But it seems as if
it had.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.386
- It likes to read?
- I do not know.

30:12.386 --> 30:14.747
It likes to write, to draw?

30:14.747 --> 30:17.665
I do not know anything on him.

30:17.706 --> 30:21.585
Good, only one thing.
It likes music.

30:23.025 --> 30:24.269
What good.

30:28.264 --> 30:33.344
Hello. Sam said to me that
you like music.

30:33.944 --> 30:37.023
You know It to touch?
Sight.

30:39.944 --> 30:42.423
Is good, ah?
Taking.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.944
It was of my papa. It passed away
before I was born…

30:44.944 --> 30:47.863
… and soon my mother me gave it.
But she died in an accident…

30:47.863 --> 30:51.303
… but before one had married with Sam,
that he was the best friend of my papa.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.983
I am speaking too much?
Because I do that sometimes.

30:53.983 --> 30:56.261
If uncomfortable you
and single I follow and continue speaking…

30:56.261 --> 30:57.662
… simply you warn to me.
Is well?

30:58.822 --> 31:01.061
I am going to help Sam
with the supper.

31:01.061 --> 31:02.740
If you want you can have supper
with us…

31:02.740 --> 31:04.182
… or you can eat here.

31:04.182 --> 31:07.461
You know, to eat there you have
where sentarte…

31:07.741 --> 31:09.501
It is not much, but…

31:10.501 --> 31:12.381
My name is Victory.

31:29.299 --> 31:34.379
- I am going It to look for?
- No, it leaves comes single.

31:34.379 --> 31:39.099
- Perhaps it does not know how.
- Then we give the opportunity him to learn.

31:39.699 --> 31:43.498
Nothing like the own learning of
to become as a child to man.

31:43.578 --> 31:46.698
- How you know if never you had a son?
- It spoke by personal experience…

31:46.698 --> 31:49.978
-… you do not forget that sometimes I was young.
- You do not say to me.

31:49.978 --> 31:51.178
Yes, I say to you.

31:52.497 --> 31:53.377
They see.

31:53.937 --> 31:56.217
Thanks for the food
that we are going to eat…

31:56.217 --> 31:58.817
… thanks for La Paz that there is
in this house,…

31:58.817 --> 32:01.257
thanks for another day of
health and happiness…

32:01.257 --> 32:02.336
… and, please…

32:02.856 --> 32:06.377
… beam that Victory is a successful
tremendous in its concert of piano.

32:06.416 --> 32:08.095
One assumes that you cannot request
those things.

32:08.256 --> 32:09.016
Who said?

32:09.016 --> 32:12.897
You were. From small that you say to me
that that is one of the rules.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.336
You say that never I said to you about
the special exception…

32:15.456 --> 32:16.696
… for the piano concerts
important.

32:16.816 --> 32:19.655
Ah sure exceptions!
And I am created it.

32:20.174 --> 32:23.455
I know, likes more when you agree
yet what I say.

32:23.455 --> 32:24.696
I will use a little as soup.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.375
- There it comes.
- Good…

32:30.375 --> 32:33.894
… you arrive at just in time.
This it is your place.

32:36.294 --> 32:37.494
They see, si?ntate.

32:44.573 --> 32:47.572
- Victory, you could…
- Ah, insurance.

32:50.973 --> 32:55.812
Sam cooked this. He is his world-wide
famous soup of Popes and vegetables.

32:55.852 --> 32:57.293
“World-wide famous”.

33:00.692 --> 33:04.652
- This is your napkin.
- Bread?

33:21.570 --> 33:26.649
No, it watches. This is a spoon.
This is your spoon.

33:29.169 --> 33:30.331
Thus, it watches.

33:56.247 --> 33:57.488
A dueto.

34:09.926 --> 34:12.085
My name is Danny.

34:20.364 --> 34:22.245
We will not put the dressing to him
again…

34:22.245 --> 34:23.605
… we cannot more do.

34:23.605 --> 34:24.964
It seems that it is cured.

34:26.284 --> 34:28.085
It was about to to ask to you…

34:29.844 --> 34:30.964
… what is this?

34:31.844 --> 34:35.643
It is well, is no problem.
I do not go to quit?rtelo.

34:36.965 --> 34:39.123
When he was young had
cattle tender hat.

34:40.524 --> 34:43.844
I slept with him, ate with him,
he bit it…

34:44.443 --> 34:47.123
… and if somebody me it tried it to remove,
it had the same reaction.

34:49.444 --> 34:52.242
It was thinking, you have been
here by…

34:52.242 --> 34:53.282
… some weeks…

34:53.882 --> 34:55.523
You would like…

34:55.963 --> 34:57.482
… to breathe a little fresh air…

34:57.883 --> 35:00.922
… to stretch the legs.
He is pretty outside.

35:01.322 --> 35:03.122
It is well
in here.

35:04.601 --> 35:07.722
You are scared to leave
and that you cannot return here.

35:08.881 --> 35:11.880
You will return, you I promise it.

35:15.081 --> 35:19.440
To tell the truth, I need
little of your aid.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.521
With the pianos?

35:20.600 --> 35:22.641
Accompanying Victoria
to the school.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.240
Taken care of with the path.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.999
- It is here.
- Listening, we will come by you to 3.

35:36.999 --> 35:38.158
I have 18 years, Sam.

35:38.158 --> 35:40.079
- And all one average week and. To 3.
- It is well.

35:40.119 --> 35:41.199
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

35:41.199 --> 35:42.559
Good bye.

35:46.359 --> 35:49.039
- You are well?
- She kissed to me.

35:49.039 --> 35:51.758
If, already I know it.
How was?

35:53.197 --> 35:55.118
- Humid.
- That is everything?

35:56.077 --> 35:57.396
- Pleasant.

35:57.517 --> 36:01.517
Humid and pleasant. Thus it is like
a kiss feels.

36:01.517 --> 36:02.876
We go, we have much to do.

36:09.956 --> 36:12.076
- Hello wanted!
- Good day, Mandy.

36:12.797 --> 36:15.435
Mandy has the best supermarket
of this zone of Glasgow.

36:15.516 --> 36:18.315
- Mandy, this is Danny.
- Hello, Danny.

36:18.796 --> 36:20.035
He is a little timid.

36:20.116 --> 36:22.116
I like that my men
be timid.

36:22.116 --> 36:24.075
That does everything a challenge
for the girls.

36:25.075 --> 36:27.435
Only queria to teach the 5 keys to them
in order to make a good purchase.

36:27.595 --> 36:29.034
Never fu?ste a good teacher.

36:29.034 --> 36:29.994
It is certain.

36:30.474 --> 36:34.954
My mother took two rocks and one cup from
water and made a food for 3.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.434
Asique when I already had
sufficient age…

36:37.434 --> 36:39.474
… it gave the secrets me
of the good kitchen…

36:39.593 --> 36:40.874
and now you I am going them to teach
to you.

36:41.274 --> 36:43.314
You are ready to learn the secrets
of the good kitchen?

36:43.314 --> 36:45.473
- Yes.
- Well, we begin then.

36:45.794 --> 36:48.792
- The fruits speak.
- The fruits speak.

36:49.353 --> 36:50.272
You did not know it, truth?

36:50.313 --> 36:52.793
- No
- The fruits speak.

36:53.193 --> 36:55.472
They will say everything to you what
you need to know…

36:55.632 --> 36:56.632
Everything what you have
that to do it is…

36:56.712 --> 36:57.872
… to learn the language.

36:58.552 --> 37:00.472
We will take this melon,
for example…

37:02.471 --> 37:03.471
… what you think that it is saying?

37:08.511 --> 37:12.151
Yes, but also it is saying
“I am Already mature”.

37:12.911 --> 37:14.990
- Sabes what means “mature”?
- No

37:15.031 --> 37:19.071
“Mature” it means “candy”,
and “candy” means “good”

37:20.231 --> 37:22.351
The kiss was mature.

37:23.470 --> 37:28.270
No, the kiss was sweet,
the melon this mature one.

37:28.270 --> 37:30.869
But mature it means candy.

37:31.310 --> 37:34.469
Good, but that if you are
speaking of fruits.

37:34.469 --> 37:39.629
The kisses are a notion in case
same, the kisses are… complicated.

37:39.629 --> 37:41.908
So far only llev?monos
this melon.

37:43.869 --> 37:46.069
The good bread is fresh.
It smells.

37:46.069 --> 37:51.308
-, Yes fresh.
- Fresh.

37:51.628 --> 37:53.947
Well, it brings breads.

38:00.547 --> 38:05.827
Very well, now the part comes
difficult. To cook.

38:06.947 --> 38:10.987
In that closet there is a great pot
and round. Me you could bring?

38:11.466 --> 38:12.386
Yes.

38:16.026 --> 38:20.545
When you are cooking, the food
it speaks to us in another language…

38:20.545 --> 38:22.626
… that we listened
with our language…

38:22.626 --> 38:25.346
… like the flavor.
It watches these beauties.

38:27.024 --> 38:28.064
If!

38:30.064 --> 38:33.025
One knows that it has good sausages
when they know thus.

38:38.984 --> 38:42.423
You found something truth?
D?jame to see.

38:45.343 --> 38:48.823
That is Victory when
she was baby.

38:49.943 --> 38:56.902
This is Victory with its mother.
His father was my better friend.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.821
It passed away before Victoria
it was born.

39:03.182 --> 39:05.742
Her mother also was
my better friend…

39:07.140 --> 39:13.020
… for that reason, after he
it passed away, we married.

39:15.020 --> 39:18.461
Then there was an accident
when Victory was seven years old…

39:19.061 --> 39:21.779
… her mother died and I
I lost the Vista.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.020
Victory remained
with me.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.020
The form in which is strange
our family formed truth?

39:31.781 --> 39:34.219
- You have family?
- I do not know it.

39:34.819 --> 39:38.380
Surely that yes. All have
a family in some place.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.139
Not them memory.

39:43.979 --> 39:46.298
Perhaps someday you do it.

39:48.337 --> 39:50.298
The pots are here.

39:59.337 --> 40:02.418
- Earth to Danny!
- Sam sent to me by you.

40:02.457 --> 40:05.937
Single? It is a great day then.
We are going to celebrate.

40:06.376 --> 40:10.817
- What is that?
- “To celebrate”, it means that beams somewhat special.

40:10.897 --> 40:13.055
Sam said that fueramos direct
to house.

40:13.896 --> 40:14.936
It walks, we go.

40:18.974 --> 40:20.696
Thanks.

40:21.055 --> 40:23.816
This it is a cone,
and this is frozen.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.655
Sometimes you ate ice cream?

40:27.175 --> 40:31.174
- No
- Good, this is frozen of vanilla, and is white.

40:31.575 --> 40:33.494
Vanilla is white.

40:33.494 --> 40:34.735
We go, pru?balo.

40:45.253 --> 40:47.613
No, only dalo returned
in your mouth.

40:51.453 --> 40:54.293
Oh, by God!
Sabes a thing of ice creams?

40:54.293 --> 40:57.173
First he is cold and later sweet…

40:57.293 --> 41:00.972
… and if you are never congealed the mouth
you will be able to savor the sweet part.

41:00.972 --> 41:03.852
- Then, we are going to do it thus… - Sweet it is good.

41:03.892 --> 41:05.132
, Yes certain.

41:05.292 --> 41:06.691
Sight, you lick it…

41:08.612 --> 41:09.811
… something thus.

41:12.531 --> 41:13.731
Also.

41:16.291 --> 41:17.212
How is everything?

41:22.891 --> 41:24.849
Sight, you have stained yourself
by all sides.

41:27.290 --> 41:29.930
We must worry to us.
We go.

41:31.730 --> 41:34.329
- You are well?
- Yes.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.450
Fast Term?natelo.

41:36.769 --> 41:39.249
If Sam asks where we were
d?jame to speak to me.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.849
If one finds out that we ate ice cream
before the supper…

41:40.849 --> 41:43.568
… one is going away to anger by the one of
appetite, you understand?

41:43.889 --> 41:45.289
What is “appetite”?

41:45.368 --> 41:48.409
“Appetite” is what you are not going to have
if you have the full ice cream stomach.

41:48.409 --> 41:51.007
- How is my mouth?
- Pretty.

41:51.248 --> 41:53.928
No, she is not pretty.
She is full of apparatuses.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.607
But not for a long time.

41:56.488 --> 41:57.727
Strange to your mother?

41:59.167 --> 42:02.288
Every day.
You strange to your mother?

42:03.408 --> 42:04.847
Nonmemory to my mother.

42:05.647 --> 42:08.647
Sometimes I believe that it would be
easier not to remember.

42:13.206 --> 42:15.166
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.326
They arrive behind schedule.

42:16.766 --> 42:18.525
It was a so pretty day
that we decided…

42:18.606 --> 42:20.286
… to take the long way.

42:20.326 --> 42:25.125
I did not say to you that they came
direct to house.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.685
Sam, is my fault.
Not of him.

42:27.685 --> 42:31.084
If you wanted to take
long way, Victory…

42:31.124 --> 42:32.365
… you could have gone to that
school in Kansas…

42:32.365 --> 42:34.845
… where you could take a way
of 50 km and it would not matter to me.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.123
- 50 km of maize fields!
- The maize is safe.

42:37.204 --> 42:39.644
The maize is boring.
In addition this school is better.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.923
And for that reason we are here and no
with cereals, correct?

42:43.443 --> 42:46.443
Hazme a favor,
you do not make worry me.

42:46.443 --> 42:48.004
It is well, Sam.

42:51.123 --> 42:53.683
- What is that?
- What?

42:54.043 --> 42:55.123
It smells of ice cream.

42:55.844 --> 42:58.083
- Ice cream of vanilla.
- Vanilla is white.

42:58.083 --> 43:01.603
First he is cold, later sweet.

43:02.203 --> 43:03.921
Sweet is good!

43:20.321 --> 43:21.321
Victory…

43:22.200 --> 43:23.001
Yes?

43:25.640 --> 43:27.960
… sometimes it worries to me this
boy.

43:28.799 --> 43:32.320
It is as if something or somebody had
closed its heart so strongly…

43:32.320 --> 43:34.319
… that with himself not to enter
contact with him.

43:34.800 --> 43:37.079
He is that what treatment to do.

43:38.679 --> 43:40.599
With vanilla ice cream?

43:41.440 --> 43:44.399
I believe that we would have to think
in a different strategy.

43:45.798 --> 43:48.239
- Good night.
- Good night.

44:03.237 --> 44:04.557
They see.

44:10.876 --> 44:14.317
When she was small, it used to do this
with my mother and Sam.

44:14.796 --> 44:17.035
It was when I discovered
that I liked music.

44:17.116 --> 44:18.396
Ves this of here?

44:18.556 --> 44:21.795
- “Notes” are called.
- Notes.

44:23.276 --> 44:27.036
- The notes are signals.
- Notes are signals.

44:27.036 --> 44:27.636
Well.

44:27.636 --> 44:28.954
The notes are signals.

44:29.355 --> 44:34.235
Then, you see this note here?
It is the signal to touch this key.

44:36.354 --> 44:40.194
And this one of here, this key.

44:40.675 --> 44:43.713
And this one, this key.

44:45.754 --> 44:48.513
Well, now you are going to touch…

44:48.513 --> 44:49.833
… and you are going it to make more express.

44:59.234 --> 45:01.512
Very well prepared?

45:03.232 --> 45:04.592
Now I go.

45:11.632 --> 45:13.751
It follows, noneven.

45:43.149 --> 45:44.429
She is not mature.

45:44.429 --> 45:46.109
- Hello Sam.
- Hello, Mandy.

45:46.189 --> 45:49.908
- How goes the lessons?
- They go by the best way…

45:49.988 --> 45:51.468
Well mature.

45:52.388 --> 45:54.268
Here bastard Ven!

45:59.747 --> 46:01.107
Went away this way, express!

46:03.628 --> 46:04.347
Take hold it.

46:07.026 --> 46:08.346
Where is Danny?

46:12.187 --> 46:12.866
Danny!

46:14.146 --> 46:15.466
She is mature.

46:18.627 --> 46:19.545
Largu?monos of here.

46:19.585 --> 46:20.546
Danny!

46:23.146 --> 46:24.346
This one is mature.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.825
Danny, you remember when I said to you…

46:29.866 --> 46:32.985
that neither Victory nor I would do
questions…

46:32.985 --> 46:35.384
… because the moment in which would arrive
you would be ready to give answers?

46:35.745 --> 46:37.465
- I decide to Me.
- Good…

46:37.465 --> 46:41.584
… after which it happened in
supermarket, I need some answers…

46:41.584 --> 46:44.184
… that I do not believe that it is going to obtain
without hacerte some questions.

46:44.184 --> 46:46.343
- Is well?
- It is well.

46:46.623 --> 46:51.224
In the supermarket,
men were fighting.

46:51.464 --> 46:53.262
- Sab?as that, truth?
- Yes.

46:53.543 --> 46:55.702
- But did not bother to you?
- No

46:55.822 --> 46:57.424
- You were not scared?
- No

46:57.743 --> 47:00.823
Generally the people
before situations like that…

47:00.902 --> 47:02.983
… they feel fear.

47:02.983 --> 47:04.502
To my they do not scare to me.

47:06.062 --> 47:07.781
One more a question…

47:09.142 --> 47:12.742
When you arrived here
you were seriously wounded.

47:12.901 --> 47:14.181
How is that it happened?

47:14.341 --> 47:15.822
I requested a piano.

47:17.541 --> 47:18.860
To whom you requested a piano to him.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.100
To my uncle.

47:20.341 --> 47:21.741
Then yes you have family?

47:22.540 --> 47:25.140
- No
- But you finish to me saying that you have an uncle.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.300
He is dead.

47:31.021 --> 47:34.100
- Is good this?
- Magnificent.

47:49.938 --> 47:51.258
Oh, God!

47:52.617 --> 47:55.338
These making the ridiculous situation.
It is not for as much.

49:00.653 --> 49:03.293
We are going to remove a photo.

49:10.652 --> 49:13.452
- Sight, seems a globe.
- Where is?

49:13.492 --> 49:18.771
- There same.
- Yes, where it must be.

49:28.411 --> 49:32.089
- Hello, I can enter?
- Yes.

49:33.610 --> 49:36.050
- Where you learned that?
- What thing?

49:36.210 --> 49:37.969
Music that you finish touching.

49:39.090 --> 49:40.929
It is what I hear in my head.

49:41.369 --> 49:42.928
T?cala again.

49:49.408 --> 49:52.409
It is difficult. Somebody must to you
to have taught.

49:53.048 --> 49:55.408
- You do not remember.
- No

49:56.048 --> 49:59.008
Surely which it was in your other life,
the one that you had before knowing us.

49:59.207 --> 50:00.328
I do not know it.

50:00.409 --> 50:02.687
All yours
he is new now…

50:02.886 --> 50:05.447
… your clothes, your hair,
all your life.

50:05.447 --> 50:06.407
This is the latest…

50:11.247 --> 50:13.927
I believe that it is hour to leave
the last thing back.

50:14.567 --> 50:15.806
You do not create?

51:09.642 --> 51:11.802
Everything what there is in you
he is new now.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.040
Good night.

51:57.358 --> 52:03.598
Friend, we go away a
to amuse much.

52:10.637 --> 52:13.478
Very either, very or.

52:16.317 --> 52:20.875
You know, the concert of Victoria
it is the month that comes.

52:20.995 --> 52:21.956
Yes?

52:22.396 --> 52:26.316
You remember that I to you said that
it had grown in New York City.

52:26.316 --> 52:27.956
Where is Carnegie Hall?

52:29.875 --> 52:34.035
Yes, well, of it is there of where Victoria
and I we are. It is our house.

52:34.115 --> 52:38.155
- This one is its house.
- No, this one is only one temp house.

52:38.275 --> 52:41.474
We only came here so that Victoria
it could go to that school.

52:43.715 --> 52:45.755
What I mean, Danny,
he is that…

52:47.074 --> 52:50.913
… after Victory graduates
we will return to house.

52:52.714 --> 52:54.353
We are going to return to New York.

52:55.273 --> 53:00.512
And… not how decirte
this, but…

53:01.673 --> 53:04.233
… we would like that you came
with us…

53:04.633 --> 53:08.552
… because your already you are part
of the family…

53:09.632 --> 53:12.352
… and, well, that is what
the families do…

53:13.711 --> 53:14.951
… to stay together…

53:15.191 --> 53:16.872
… or at least that is
that this family does.

53:18.792 --> 53:21.831
Then, what you say to me?

53:26.111 --> 53:27.751
Very either, very or.

53:32.389 --> 53:38.071

This one is your pay.

53:40.350 --> 53:43.310
50/50, partners, you and I.

53:44.629 --> 53:48.588
- Satisfied.
- And what I do with this?

53:49.069 --> 53:50.869
What you want.

54:11.108 --> 54:13.307
Hey, f?jate by where you walk.

54:14.266 --> 54:18.625
Danny!
Hello, Danny. M?rate nothing else!

54:18.625 --> 54:22.747
You see yourself very well,
and you smell divine!

54:22.747 --> 54:24.586
It tell me, where you have yourself been
dressing.

54:25.306 --> 54:27.505
All it has gone to you of
wonders, ah?

54:27.505 --> 54:28.466
The head commands to me to buy…

54:28.466 --> 54:31.226
handles and papayas
and they watch what I am…

54:31.226 --> 54:32.345
… a lemon.

54:36.265 --> 54:39.664
Your uncle Bart has very been
worried about you.

54:40.465 --> 54:42.705
Its small lost friend
in the world.

54:42.705 --> 54:44.425
Sincerely, it does not stop
to say…

54:44.425 --> 54:46.024
… where she is my
small Danny?

54:46.184 --> 54:47.144
It is dead.

54:47.384 --> 54:48.544
- Who said that to you?
- I saw.

54:48.544 --> 54:52.304
Then it dresses bad, because it is
vivito and fishtailing…

54:52.304 --> 54:54.703
… and wishing fervent
that you return to house.

54:54.863 --> 54:57.423
- That is not plus my house.
- “It is not plus my house”.

54:57.423 --> 54:58.583
“It is not plus my house”.

54:58.663 --> 55:01.663
Because?
Tienes a new house, Danny?

55:04.263 --> 55:06.182
Tienes new family also?

55:09.062 --> 55:13.182
I say this to you because if you do not return
to house like good puta…

55:13.182 --> 55:16.463
… your uncle Bart will send boys
to hacerte a visit to your new house.

55:16.542 --> 55:20.021
You would like that. It would not be very difficult
to find it, since purchases here.

55:25.581 --> 55:30.381
Mira who has returned with his
uncle Bart! Dame a hug.

55:31.101 --> 55:34.141
That is my boy.
Hum, you smell well.

55:34.660 --> 55:38.179
M?ralo to him.
He himself atuendo.

55:39.379 --> 55:41.260
We surprised Danny to you.
Truth that we did it?

55:41.260 --> 55:42.699
If, really you
we were strange, Danny.

55:42.699 --> 55:44.059
You are due to have scared…

55:44.059 --> 55:46.420
… in that accident,
with the shooting.

55:46.420 --> 55:47.819
If, I also.

55:47.819 --> 55:48.859
Hey, m?rame.
M?rame…

55:49.260 --> 55:51.218

55:51.218 --> 55:55.659
… but now I am of return,
and ready for the combat.

55:55.699 --> 55:57.258
You are ready for the combat?

55:57.697 --> 55:59.098
I have a question.

56:01.338 --> 56:03.178
Tienes a question?

56:03.697 --> 56:05.258
This wonder never finishes.

56:05.258 --> 56:08.058
- Will not be again the one of the piano, truth?
- No

56:08.098 --> 56:13.378
Well, it listens. As I am so contented
of tenerte in house…

56:14.777 --> 56:18.016
… I will respond a question to you.
We go, tell me.

56:18.696 --> 56:20.537

56:22.537 --> 56:27.016
To your mother? How you want
that it knows your mother?

56:27.815 --> 56:32.616
I found you in the street, wire drawing
in the pavement, left.

56:33.215 --> 56:36.295
You could not nor speak.
You were only thrown there.

56:38.375 --> 56:43.054
Nobody wanted to you. To anybody it mattered to him
if you were alive or dead…

56:43.654 --> 56:44.934
… except a me.

56:45.534 --> 56:48.374

You have been speaking with somebody?

57:12.532 --> 57:13.612

57:17.212 --> 57:20.091
A good advice listens

57:22.451 --> 57:25.332
You do not league together to the past…

57:25.332 --> 57:27.810
… it watches towards the future.

57:28.691 --> 57:32.690
The past it is behind you.

57:33.091 --> 57:36.290
The future this in front of you.

57:37.209 --> 57:40.771
A shining brilliant and
gold mountain.

57:42.170 --> 57:45.010
Quieres to know which is
your future, Danny?

57:48.489 --> 57:52.769
I am very contented of which it appeared.

57:53.769 --> 57:55.248

The fight is about to to begin.

It was never better.

58:03.087 --> 58:06.167

in staying tonight with life.

58:06.167 --> 58:07.728
For that reason I dressed it like
one puta shining.

58:12.687 --> 58:15.846
We hoped that it offers something us
more of spectacle tonight.

58:15.846 --> 58:17.286
One does not worry.

58:17.286 --> 58:20.087
We have worked in that.
Is not certain, Danny?

58:53.684 --> 58:57.723
Listening, dales to these ignorantes
a little spectacle.

58:57.723 --> 58:59.324
It pretends by a time.

58:59.364 --> 59:01.763
Beam that seems that
they have the opportunity…

59:01.763 --> 59:05.924
-… of derrotarte.

59:05.924 --> 59:08.402

Who has filled the excrement head to you?

59:29.081 --> 59:31.280
Some problem, horsemen?

59:31.280 --> 59:33.480
No, no, no.
We are well.

59:33.719 --> 59:36.160
We only are
discussing the strategy.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.360
By all means.

59:38.520 --> 59:42.640
Excrement listening, dog. You are going to go

We will make a treatment. If your you go there down

01:00:05.839 --> 01:00:07.397

V? by them, tiger!

01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:48.274
Vamos!

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:10.112
- What is what it is happening?
- You said that you wanted more entertainment.

01:01:10.832 --> 01:01:12.951
But he is not fighting.

01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:25.430
Fight!

01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:28.471
M?talo!

01:01:28.471 --> 01:01:29.702
Danny!

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:49.029
Danny!

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.629
It seems that we have problems.

01:01:59.629 --> 01:02:00.268
What happens?

01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:03.429
This people came to see a fight.
Not a sample of affective hugs.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:11.227
- Does not matter to him makes something more creative?
- It is its show.

01:02:57.664 --> 01:03:01.903
Danny, these ruining to me.
Is hour to gain something of money!

01:03:02.584 --> 01:03:05.863
Danny, you are going to cause that they kill to you.
At?calos also.

01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:11.743
Danny!

01:03:35.902 --> 01:03:37.300
Arms!

01:04:46.615 --> 01:04:50.213
M?talos!
If not them bushes, do not pay to me!

01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:53.815
Danny, by the love of God…

01:04:58.333 --> 01:04:59.814
Or I will kill myself.

01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:01.094
M?talo!

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.093
Stupid…

01:05:13.972 --> 01:05:15.772
Not more deaths!

01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:19.572
I decide when
there are no more deaths, I!

01:05:19.572 --> 01:05:22.572
The master orders and
the dog obeys!

01:05:23.371 --> 01:05:25.331
I will kill to you.

01:05:27.252 --> 01:05:28.491
Put it in its place.

01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:30.771
It enters there.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.290
So that one went away?

01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:50.850
Perhaps it had something to do.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:54.049
I thought that he was happy here.

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:57.410
Oh, affection.
It happens that sometimes…

01:05:57.529 --> 01:05:59.448
… to be happy it is not sufficient.

01:05:59.608 --> 01:06:01.528
Sometimes the people
they must return…

01:06:01.728 --> 01:06:04.888
… to solve the things that did them
poor devils before they were happy.

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:07.047
I could help it.

01:06:08.607 --> 01:06:13.647
I know it. But sometimes the people
they must solve the things by themselves.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.081
You lay to Me!

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.679
Bastard!

01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:50.799
What you are doing in
my office, stupid idiot?

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.839
You lay to Me!
This is my mother.

01:07:55.159 --> 01:07:56.479
You yes knew my mother.

01:07:57.039 --> 01:08:01.399
Puta was one.
Sabes what puta is one, Danny?

01:08:01.438 --> 01:08:02.998
Money by sex.

01:08:03.519 --> 01:08:04.918
When this woman
she appeared this way…

01:08:05.277 --> 01:08:07.678
… I did everything what I could to help it.

01:08:10.838 --> 01:08:14.597
I liked your mother.
It included/understood to me.

01:08:16.278 --> 01:08:19.397
If it had had somebody special one,
she had been she.

01:08:19.957 --> 01:08:21.156
When she died…

01:08:21.636 --> 01:08:23.077
… I replaced it…

01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:27.475
… cri?ndote, protegi?ndote.

01:08:28.357 --> 01:08:32.915
Sight, this is a photography
of her, it watches.

01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:45.755
Excuse haberte lain, Danny…

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:50.115
… I did it because I love you.

01:08:52.634 --> 01:08:53.473
And now…

01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.874
… you are going to cause that it recovers the money
that you made me lose the other night.

01:08:57.874 --> 01:08:58.633
Certain?

01:09:03.674 --> 01:09:10.354
You know, Danny, sometimes in the families
a tragedy is necessary…

01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:14.153
-… to unite them again.
- Absolutely, head…

01:09:14.153 --> 01:09:16.393
… the family is the unique thing
really irreplaceable.

01:09:16.393 --> 01:09:17.871
- We were used to going to…
- Disc?lpame…

01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:19.712
Modales What are those?
I am speaking.

01:09:19.712 --> 01:09:20.832
It was only thinking, head.

01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:23.072
- I asked something to You on you family?
- No, head. He only is that…

01:09:23.072 --> 01:09:25.350
You could callarte of once?

01:09:26.231 --> 01:09:27.832
Now I lost the thread of which
it was thinking.

01:09:27.911 --> 01:09:30.192
- What was saying?
- Family.

01:09:30.192 --> 01:09:31.830
Certain, certain. Yes.

01:09:31.830 --> 01:09:32.830
That they had to be together.

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:36.591
Exactly, the families would have
to stay united.

01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:39.109
- Without concerning nothing.
- Without concerning nothing.

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:47.149
- Detente! What you are doing?
- Danny!

01:10:49.904 --> 01:10:53.385
My mother was one puta.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:57.824
Sight, is not that is an expert,
but I must say…

01:10:57.824 --> 01:10:59.663
… it does not seem to be that.

01:11:00.264 --> 01:11:02.703
You know, that type of woman.

01:11:03.182 --> 01:11:04.464
What you mean?

01:11:05.103 --> 01:11:07.024
Good, it is touching the piano.

01:11:07.424 --> 01:11:09.222
What plus has in the photo?

01:11:09.622 --> 01:11:12.223
There is a group of students
in uniform…

01:11:12.223 --> 01:11:14.423
… and a great window
with vitr?.

01:11:15.782 --> 01:11:17.902
It seems a music academy
or something of the sort.

01:11:17.902 --> 01:11:20.062
There are two great pianos
at heart.

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:21.422
What class of great piano?

01:11:21.982 --> 01:11:23.462
“Pleyel”, both.

01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.341
I have one devises.

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:31.381
Excellent work did with
pianos of the conservatory.

01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:33.261
Thank you very much, lady.

01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:38.300
The last tuner that we had was
always drunk. He did not have time.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:42.539
It ended up desafinando everything.
A disaster.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.259
Danny.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.139
Although I see so many faces
every year, never forgetfulness one.

01:11:56.699 --> 01:11:58.139
Specially this.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.498
- What had this face of special?
- A shining girl, absolutely…

01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:05.138
-… the best one of the class.
He was destined to excel.

01:12:05.138 --> 01:12:10.738
Then a day she
simply it disappeared.

01:12:10.978 --> 01:12:12.378
Pensabamos that had returned
to its house…

01:12:12.378 --> 01:12:16.218
… or that it had received some news,
or that had money problems.

01:12:16.858 --> 01:12:21.416
But later a family
of China she wrote to us…

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:23.257
… to know its whereabouts.

01:12:24.217 --> 01:12:27.536
It had a small son…
and everything becomes strange there.

01:12:27.536 --> 01:12:28.776
A sad history, the truth.

01:12:31.257 --> 01:12:33.297
Ah! Here it is.

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:14.172
- You are well?
- I am well.

01:13:14.812 --> 01:13:18.492
- Surely?
- Surely.

01:13:19.012 --> 01:13:20.252
It is well.

01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.052
Hello.

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:38.971
Boys? Sam?

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:42.970
Danny?

01:13:58.009 --> 01:13:59.648
One assumed that you would go to me
to look for.

01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:02.289
I feel it.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.048
Tienes another photo?

01:14:09.848 --> 01:14:12.847
That woman said that she was
an excellent pianista.

01:14:12.847 --> 01:14:14.128
Surely that was it.

01:14:18.568 --> 01:14:22.368
- Quieres to hear touch it?
- How?

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:29.007
Ves? Those are the notes
of the sonata N? 19.

01:14:32.886 --> 01:14:37.006
Your mother not only touched music,
she touched beautiful music.

01:14:37.287 --> 01:14:40.646
Magical music.
An excellent music.

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:34.797
Excuse that it bothers it, but really
I need to know how where to find it to him.

01:16:36.116 --> 01:16:38.635
I have never seen it in my life.

01:16:42.196 --> 01:16:44.276
D?jeme to ask to him again.

01:16:51.554 --> 01:16:54.754
- What is this?
-!Oh Sam, Sam!

01:16:54.794 --> 01:16:57.154
He remembered it, I I was touching
the piano… music…

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:59.755
-… and one remembered
- Delay, hopes, remembered what?

01:16:59.755 --> 01:17:01.594
Of its mother, it remembered who
it killed its mother.

01:17:01.715 --> 01:17:03.513
- Recordaste who killed your mother?
- Sam, we must go to us…

01:17:03.513 --> 01:17:06.033
Delay, son. Before leaving
running…

01:17:06.033 --> 01:17:08.074
… we are going to take itself a little while stops
to understand what is what it is happening.

01:17:08.074 --> 01:17:11.913
Cu?ntame from the beginning.

01:17:24.711 --> 01:17:27.192

01:17:32.392 --> 01:17:33.871
Danny.
Danny, hopes!

01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:57.469
Those types will not be able with him,
he is very hard.

01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:59.269
It also sees you.
Espera!

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.469
I want it alive. It does not serve to me
of excrement if he is dead.

01:18:02.549 --> 01:18:03.829
Mu?vete!

01:18:42.505 --> 01:18:47.026
Excrement. It will be better than
you enter.

01:19:09.343 --> 01:19:10.823
You and you, that way.

01:19:16.582 --> 01:19:17.903

01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:14.487
Very well.

01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:16.279
He is a boy who escapes
of the bullets, eh?

01:22:39.846 --> 01:22:44.365
Damn you are.
Grand?simo son of puta.

01:22:47.485 --> 01:22:51.045
All this is in your account,
Danny. You are listening to Me?

01:22:51.045 --> 01:22:53.004
Everything is in your account.

01:22:57.324 --> 01:22:59.203
And now you are going it to pay.

01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:17.002
You know, in fact was your fault.

01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:22.843
Your eras an incredible fighter,
and I saw your potential.

01:23:23.163 --> 01:23:24.682
With the training
correct…

01:23:24.962 --> 01:23:27.162
… God had done you.

01:23:27.763 --> 01:23:29.082
It hears, Danny…

01:23:29.282 --> 01:23:31.481
… I know that we had some
bad moments,…

01:23:31.481 --> 01:23:33.762
… all the families have them.

01:23:34.522 --> 01:23:34.721
Listening, if you only leave me

… we will have many more
bad moments.

It lets breathe in my
damn ears.

01:24:15.079 --> 01:24:16.038
Vamos, apartate backwards!

01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:37.556
This bastard is intelligent.

01:24:38.916 --> 01:24:42.076
Wait for all here.

01:24:43.435 --> 01:24:44.555

01:24:47.395 --> 01:24:48.316
Danny!

01:24:49.675 --> 01:24:50.634

01:25:14.714 --> 01:25:15.753

01:25:23.912 --> 01:25:26.752
Dejaste that good life

01:25:27.673 --> 01:25:29.032
Is here?

01:25:29.032 --> 01:25:30.832
This is your refuge, your new home
ever since you were yourself of house?

01:25:32.032 --> 01:25:34.072
This is the place where…

01:25:35.551 --> 01:25:37.632
… “you woke up”?

01:25:37.711 --> 01:25:40.752
Art, books…

01:25:42.631 --> 01:25:44.111
… music?

01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:47.591
So that?

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.950
That does one better person to you?

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:53.230
Sight which you do fact of that.

01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:55.310
Those likeable people
they let to you enter…

01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:56.269
… and they gave everything you.

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:59.990
And it watches how these paying to them,…

01:26:00.511 --> 01:26:03.230
… you are destroying its lives…

01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:05.989
… as you destroy any life.

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:09.908
That that because you are not done
for this type of life, Danny.

01:26:09.908 --> 01:26:13.029
You are a dog, my dog!

01:26:13.029 --> 01:26:17.188
I fed to you, I trained to you.
I am your owner…

01:26:17.188 --> 01:26:21.427
… and as so it would have to kill to you,
like a any dog…

01:26:21.427 --> 01:26:26.388
… that causes its master so to him
misfortune, such suffering.

01:26:34.667 --> 01:26:36.867
But…

01:26:42.025 --> 01:26:43.866
… I will not do it.

01:26:50.266 --> 01:26:57.345
We go, Danny. Perd?name.
You will be out of danger.

01:26:57.466 --> 01:27:01.304
We will return to the world
that you understand.

01:27:02.424 --> 01:27:04.984
In no other world
that alive you will understand.

01:27:06.823 --> 01:27:08.824
What you say?

01:27:10.664 --> 01:27:12.224
Perdonar and to forget?

01:27:15.382 --> 01:27:19.823
I know difficult that the world
it is possible to be returned sometimes.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.023
We will cause it that it returns a
to be easy again.

01:27:24.023 --> 01:27:29.862
You and I, will have one
conciliadora life.

01:27:30.382 --> 01:27:32.741

01:27:33.221 --> 01:27:34.102

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.261
Yes.

01:27:37.741 --> 01:27:44.341
Yes, they see.
They see.

01:27:44.821 --> 01:27:46.661
Welcome to house, Danny.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.541
I already am in house.

01:28:08.059 --> 01:28:11.779
- No, Danny! Va to kill it!
- No, Danny! No!

01:28:11.779 --> 01:28:12.939

- You do not do it, Danny!
- He killed my mother!

01:28:16.179 --> 01:28:17.858
You will be just as he.

01:28:17.858 --> 01:28:20.258
He is I! We are equal!

01:28:20.258 --> 01:28:22.538
- Excrement Dog!
- No, you are not an animal!

01:28:22.538 --> 01:28:26.577
If it bushes, everything what you did
to be happy it will have been in vain.

01:28:26.577 --> 01:28:27.537
You do not listen to those excrements!

01:28:27.537 --> 01:28:29.257
They will lock up to you in a cell
for always.

01:28:29.257 --> 01:28:30.417
We are animals!

01:28:30.417 --> 01:28:31.738
No, Danny, no!

01:28:31.738 --> 01:28:32.216

01:28:32.536 --> 01:28:34.977

It made enjoy every day.

01:28:45.135 --> 01:28:48.575
It mounted it, like puta
that it was.

01:28:55.336 --> 01:28:57.215
You will never be more than a dog.

01:28:57.575 --> 01:29:02.334
You will never escape of which you are.
You will never escape of which I did of you.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:04.934
An assassin.

01:29:06.054 --> 01:29:09.174
That is what you are,
and that is what you will always be.

01:29:09.174 --> 01:29:15.934
Now I know a good dog and m?tame.
It ends this… Vamos, m?tame!

01:29:18.612 --> 01:29:20.453
C?llese the damn mouth.

01:29:24.572 --> 01:29:26.732
That man really spoke
pure excrement.

01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:52.851
You feel well with that thing
around your neck?

01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:54.730
Is this well?

01:29:57.970 --> 01:30:00.570

01:30:15.969 --> 01:30:20.288

- No, he is not of me of whom is speaking.

01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:27.607

saved by music.

That's you my boy.
