00:29.864 --> 00:31.196
<i>Shit.</i>

00:39.707 --> 00:40.708
<i>Ah, ah.</i>

01:17.477 --> 01:18.476
<i>Fuck.</i>

02:35.990 --> 02:36.991

02:39.827 --> 02:40.828
Oh!

02:41.996 --> 02:43.163
I know, Ma.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.167
I don't know what I'm doin'.

02:48.368 --> 02:51.037
Well, why don't you come down?

02:51.039 --> 02:52.239
It's freezin'.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.344
Are you sure you want me to come
down?

03:01.716 --> 03:02.850
I'm sure.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.186
Really?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.257
Really, come on.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.025
Ma, come on, okay?

03:13.027 --> 03:16.729
- Oh Jesus Christ, Ma.
- Oh yeah.

03:16.731 --> 03:19.098
Oh god.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.866
Maybe bacon and eggs

03:20.868 --> 03:22.434
- will do me...
- Ma, I'm so tired.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.370
Well, a big, greasy
breakfast and a nice nap,

03:25.372 --> 03:26.739
- that'll help.
- No, I don't want

03:26.741 --> 03:28.273
to go to the fuckin' diner now.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.374
I've been up all night.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.375
Lookin' for me.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.376
What?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.945
No, why would I look for you?

03:32.947 --> 03:34.212
You're always in the same spot.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.214
Yeah, guess I am.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.784
I guess I just thought if
anybody

03:38.786 --> 03:40.418
in the world would be lookin'
for me,

03:40.420 --> 03:43.124
it'd be you, you know.

03:45.893 --> 03:46.728
I'll treat ya.

03:47.762 --> 03:49.895
- With whose money?
- I'll pay ya back

03:49.897 --> 03:51.899
when I get my check.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.802
Huh?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.434
I don't want fuckin' eggs.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.937
I wanna sleep.

03:57.939 --> 03:59.941
Jesus, crabby.

04:01.109 --> 04:04.242
Lord love a duck, this
car is a piece of shit.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.079
Bacon and toast

04:07.081 --> 04:09.414
and two eggs, easy over.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.317
I mean, easy over, just like.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.753
You know what I'm saying?

04:13.755 --> 04:16.822
They just kiss
the, kiss the, you know...

04:16.824 --> 04:18.124
The same as always, Doreen.
Frying pan.

04:18.126 --> 04:19.992
Same thing.
Yeah, thank you,

04:19.994 --> 04:20.993
and toast on the side.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.828
Ah, I'm good, thank you.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.262
You know.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.465
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.770
I hope they don't fuck up my
eggs, yeah?

04:30.772 --> 04:33.471
How hard is it to cook a fuckin'
egg?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.440
She knows I like it easy over,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.777
and they always come
cooked straight through,

04:37.779 --> 04:40.012
and then they look at
you like you're the one

04:40.014 --> 04:41.346
with the fuckin' problem.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.448
Oh yeah, I am.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.020
I'm talkin' shit about you,
Doreen.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.287
What a bitch.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.957
She's mean-spirited since high
school,

04:51.959 --> 04:54.294
always with that mean fuckin'
mouth.

04:56.197 --> 04:57.830
Didn't her son get you pregnant?

04:57.832 --> 04:59.632
- Jesus Christ.
- I thought he did.

04:59.634 --> 05:01.534
For fuck's sake, Ma.

05:01.536 --> 05:03.836
What's his name, Greg?

05:03.838 --> 05:04.839
Greg?

05:06.207 --> 05:08.373
Reggie, it was Reggie.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.308
And we don't even get a free
coffee.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.477
- Stop.
- I'm just sayin'.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.180
You pay for an abortion,

05:14.182 --> 05:16.148
the least you should get is a
free coffee.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.482
You don't pay for an abortion.

05:17.484 --> 05:20.186
No, but you gotta pay for the
taxi,

05:20.188 --> 05:21.854
and then you got to pay

05:21.856 --> 05:23.889
for the time off work and all
that.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.158
I'm just sayin', you know.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.325
You pay for an abortion,

05:27.327 --> 05:30.998
the least you should get is a
free coffee.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.168
You're so fuckin' embarrassing.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.506
Oh, I'm embarrassing?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.377
Sorry my manic fuckin'
depression is so

05:46.379 --> 05:47.378
embarrassing to you.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.379
Don't, don't diagnose yourself.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.515
I'm not.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.517
I saw it on one of them shows,

05:51.519 --> 05:53.552
one of them shows with doctors
on 'em.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.555
Jesus!

05:57.258 --> 05:58.358
- Ma?
- Yeah?

05:59.694 --> 06:01.527
You're depressed, 'cause
you drink all the time.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.866
No, I drink all the time,
'cause I'm depressed.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.242
Look, I'll calm down for a bit.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.212
- Right.
- I will, I swear.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.888
For fuck's sake.

06:50.912 --> 06:54.980
<i>So your relationship
with your father was abusive?</i>

06:54.982 --> 06:58.449
<i>You know, it didn't feel
that way at the time,</i>

06:58.451 --> 07:00.087
<i>because it wasn't physical.</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:02.590
<i>It was emotional.</i>

07:04.091 --> 07:05.624
<i>So I normalized his behavior.</i>

07:05.626 --> 07:10.596
<i>I thought every family was like
this.</i>

07:10.598 --> 07:14.432
<i>And now that he's dead,
my life is finally mine.</i>

07:14.434 --> 07:15.601
<i>Thank you, Linda.</i>

07:15.603 --> 07:17.435
<i>You're so brave for showing up.</i>

07:21.108 --> 07:22.109
I know.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.276
They never come back.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.680
Relax, Mike, take a
break, have a sandwich.

07:27.682 --> 07:30.117
I don't want no fuckin'
sandwich.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.620
I want you to come and visit.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.121
Eat your sandwich.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.456
You can have your beer back
when you down your sandwich.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.128
Dougie, I'm, I'm so sorry.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.998
I took a nap and slept
clear through my alarm.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.465
That's okay.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.466
I'm right upstairs.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.503
No, honestly.

07:50.972 --> 07:52.470
How is she?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.474
Doug, it's the end of the month.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.310
You know how she is.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.313
Okay.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.148
- Fresh pot.
- Mm.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.985
Okay, so, him, he's in timeout.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.052
He's on a different planet
today.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.053
Look at him.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.321
Always is.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.057
Alright.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.829
Hey, button, Sunday night, you
and me?

08:16.831 --> 08:19.198
Yeah, Sunday.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.503
Hey, can I get
a vodka cranberry, hun?

08:24.505 --> 08:25.506
Yeah, sure thing.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.341
Hey, good night, Dougie.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.909
<i>You've been...</i>

08:30.911 --> 08:32.511
<i>I know two nights ago, you
were on stage with Don Rickles.</i>

08:32.513 --> 08:34.713
<i>I was on stage with
my darling Don Rickles.</i>

08:34.715 --> 08:35.714
<i>Love Don, I love him.</i>

08:35.716 --> 08:37.082
<i>I adore him.</i>

08:37.084 --> 08:39.086
<i>I watched that man at 86.</i>

08:40.054 --> 08:42.354
<i>He's a masterclass at comedy.</i>

08:42.356 --> 08:43.722
<i>You just stand there and you go</i>

08:43.724 --> 08:46.258
<i>that's how you tell a joke.</i>

08:47.361 --> 08:49.395
- <i>Icon.</i>
- <i>True icon.</i>

08:49.397 --> 08:50.696
<i>Next up for everybody is
the Look...</i>

08:50.698 --> 08:53.532
<i>Now, gorgeous case,</i>

08:53.534 --> 08:55.200
<i>it's not about the case.</i>

08:55.202 --> 08:56.201
<i>Look at the case.</i>

08:57.905 --> 09:01.206
<i>Amazing, that wonderful animal
print case, I mean, gorgeous,</i>

09:01.208 --> 09:03.275
<i>but look what is in the case,</i>

09:03.277 --> 09:07.212
<i>'cause nobody buys a
sunglass case for a case.</i>

09:07.214 --> 09:10.883
<i>All the great looks that
people like Jackie O.</i>

09:10.885 --> 09:12.718
<i>We did them in two colors.</i>

09:12.720 --> 09:14.221
<i>We did them in the black.</i>

09:16.724 --> 09:22.895
<i>The lenses on the tortoise
are in a brown family going,</i>

09:22.897 --> 09:25.397
<i>they're all on braid, and in the
black,</i>

09:25.399 --> 09:27.766
<i>they're more of a dark gray,
going down.</i>

09:27.768 --> 09:29.468
<i>You wore these on the
plane.</i>

09:29.470 --> 09:30.569
<i>I wear these with other
stuff.</i>

09:30.571 --> 09:32.271
<i>I love these.</i>

09:32.273 --> 09:36.275
<i>I love them because they're
kind of rounded, a little.</i>

09:36.277 --> 09:37.276
<i>Yes.</i>

09:37.278 --> 09:38.644
<i>Which is very good.</i>

09:38.646 --> 09:40.145
<i>They are beautifully done.</i>

09:40.147 --> 09:42.650
<i>They are lightweight but very
sturdy.</i>

09:43.751 --> 09:47.319
<i>They're not that horrible, cheap
glass</i>

09:47.321 --> 09:48.587
<i>that you get at the drugstore</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:51.590
<i>that twists off and breaks in a
second.</i>

09:51.592 --> 09:55.596
<i>And UVA, UVB, UVC, UVD,</i>

09:56.430 --> 10:00.799
<i>whatever it is, yes, the lens
is totally treated for that.</i>

10:02.303 --> 10:04.436
<i>And, yeah, full protection,
full protection.</i>

10:04.438 --> 10:05.439
Uh-uh-uh.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.941
<i>Everything I do,
because I'm gonna wear it,</i>

10:08.943 --> 10:12.512
<i>and it sounds very selfish,
I want the best quality</i>

10:12.514 --> 10:14.646
<i>for me and for you.</i>

10:14.648 --> 10:16.815
<i>This is not a secondary line of
mine.</i>

10:16.817 --> 10:20.520
<i>This is not like a better thing
going on at Neiman Marcus.</i>

10:20.522 --> 10:22.524
<i>This is it for me.</i>

10:23.691 --> 10:26.158
<i>Gorgeous case, it's not about
the case.</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:28.293
<i>Look at the case, let's start
with that.</i>

10:28.295 --> 10:31.697
<i>Amazing, that wonderful animal
print case,</i>

10:31.699 --> 10:33.632
<i>I mean, gorgeous, but look...</i>

10:33.634 --> 10:35.467
You smell like a bathhouse.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.637
You smell like a brewery.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.676
<i>You buy it for
what's in it, but take...</i>

11:06.333 --> 11:07.900
Oh, oh yeah,
babe.

11:07.902 --> 11:09.334
- Yeah.
- Oh my god.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.869
God, that feels so fucking good.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.671
Yeah, fuck me, Reggie.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.207
Yeah, baby.
Just like that.

11:15.209 --> 11:16.241
Yeah, look.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.545
Fuckin' go now, baby,
go.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.219
There are nets up there, Reggie.

11:27.221 --> 11:29.356
She knows there are fuckin' nets
up there.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.192
Yeah.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.392
Yeah, but she could still die,
though.

11:33.394 --> 11:35.761
She could hit her head on the
ledge,

11:35.763 --> 11:37.231
tangle the nets, bleed out,

11:38.399 --> 11:39.698
get found the next day, I mean...

11:39.700 --> 11:40.699
Found by who?

11:40.701 --> 11:42.535
City worker, probably.

11:42.537 --> 11:43.735
You think that's a job,

11:43.737 --> 11:45.370
and there's like a
suicide net checker guy?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.874
Yeah, probably.

11:48.242 --> 11:49.942
That's a shitty fuckin' job.

11:49.944 --> 11:52.379
Yeah, that or she could
just get paralyzed.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.048
All right, I got to go.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.449
Okay.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.450
You got to jiggle it.

11:58.452 --> 11:59.451
- What?
- Jiggle it.

11:59.453 --> 12:00.953
Lift the handle sideways.

12:00.955 --> 12:02.287
- What do you mean jiggle it?
- You just fuckin' jiggle it.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.455
Jiggle the fucking handle!

12:03.457 --> 12:04.456
Okay, all right, you know what,
fuck this.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.558
- Fuck it.
- Oh my god.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.459
Excuse me, sorry, ah.

12:07.461 --> 12:08.727
- Fuckin', really, Reggie?
- You want to just help?

12:08.729 --> 12:10.262
Can you get out of the way?

12:10.264 --> 12:11.465
Oh, here we go.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.633
For fuck's sake.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.268
Jesus.

12:16.270 --> 12:18.638
Your car's a piece of
shit.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.072
Well, I'm gettin' a new one.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.242
Yeah, sure.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.246
Okay, well, I'll call ya.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.079
Sure, call me.

12:27.081 --> 12:28.780
Okay.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.415
Okay, yeah.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.931
No hat.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.633
Tacky.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.467
Classes up the whole ensemble.

13:01.616 --> 13:03.949
So tonight,

13:03.951 --> 13:07.819
I am Gustav.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.987
Ooh.

13:08.989 --> 13:09.990
And you?

13:11.025 --> 13:13.492
Um, Ingrid.

13:13.494 --> 13:14.627
Ingrid?

13:14.629 --> 13:15.662
I love it.

13:15.664 --> 13:16.962
Tell me about Ingrid.

13:16.964 --> 13:19.965
Okay, so Ingrid, well,
she was in an orchestra.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.833
- Here?
- No, god, no,

13:21.835 --> 13:25.971
somewhere in Europe, and she had
an affair

13:25.973 --> 13:27.806
with the conductor or something.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.474
- As one does.
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.476 --> 13:33.478
But now she's retired,
and she lives in Bali

13:33.480 --> 13:36.481
or Ibiza or somewhere like that.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.688
Hmm, well, Gustav is, um,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.021
- a baron.
- Ooh.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.356
Madame and Monsieur,

13:44.358 --> 13:46.024
what can I get you?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.560
Oh, French.

13:47.562 --> 13:48.827
I'm learning French.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.663
It's going very badly,
but a man can dream.

13:50.665 --> 13:51.731
Oh, I think you're fabulous.

13:51.733 --> 13:52.831
Thank you.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.667
So she is an orchestra.

13:54.669 --> 13:55.735
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

13:55.737 --> 13:57.369
And I am royalty.

13:57.371 --> 13:58.403
Of course.

13:58.405 --> 14:03.075
And we would like two gin
martinis

14:03.077 --> 14:04.510
- ...with a twist.
- With a twist.

14:04.512 --> 14:05.511
Already started.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.681
Una momento, por favor.

14:07.549 --> 14:08.882
I realize that's not French.

14:10.384 --> 14:11.383
He's nice.

14:11.385 --> 14:14.754
Mm, for me or for you?

14:14.756 --> 14:16.522
Please.

14:16.524 --> 14:20.192
So let's get into character,
shall we?

14:20.194 --> 14:22.863
Ay, voila, two martinis.

14:37.612 --> 14:38.778
<i>The fuck is wrong</i>

14:38.780 --> 14:41.616
<i>with you?</i>

15:21.255 --> 15:23.589
<i>Fuck off, fuck off!</i>

15:23.591 --> 15:25.426
<i>Fuck you, too!</i>

15:38.105 --> 15:39.106
Hey.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.448
Oh yeah.

16:28.823 --> 16:31.323
<i>Today, we welcome
back to the show Linda Black,</i>

16:31.325 --> 16:33.992
<i>whose story of her father's
death has captured the</i>

16:33.994 --> 16:35.994
<i>attention of our
audience since day one.</i>

16:35.996 --> 16:38.664
<i>Welcome, Linda.</i>

16:38.666 --> 16:40.500
<i>So tell us about your book.</i>

16:40.502 --> 16:42.835
<i>The book is called
"I Survived."</i>

16:42.837 --> 16:44.336
<i>It's half biographical</i>

16:44.338 --> 16:47.005
<i>and half what I like to
call identifi-courage.</i>

16:47.007 --> 16:50.543
<i>So first, you have to
identify what is toxic</i>

16:50.545 --> 16:52.177
<i>about your relationship.</i>

16:52.179 --> 16:55.715
<i>And second, you must find
the courage to leave.</i>

16:58.553 --> 17:00.051
<i>Linda Black, everyone,</i>

17:00.053 --> 17:03.221
<i>transforming her pain
into this wonderful book</i>

17:03.223 --> 17:05.190
<i>with the help of the Gordon
Baker Show.</i>

17:05.192 --> 17:07.259
<i>And if everyone looks under
their seat,</i>

17:07.261 --> 17:09.027
<i>they're gonna find one.</i>

17:09.029 --> 17:10.228
<i>You get a book!</i>

17:10.230 --> 17:11.597
<i>You get a book!</i>

17:11.599 --> 17:13.031
<i>You get a book!</i>

17:28.048 --> 17:29.049
Hey!

17:30.718 --> 17:32.620
Goddam!

17:33.922 --> 17:36.889
Fuckin' Deadsville in here.

17:36.891 --> 17:37.892
Hi, fellas.

17:39.226 --> 17:43.598
Let's get some tunes goin'
in this funeral parlor.

17:44.599 --> 17:46.799
Okay, uh...

17:47.802 --> 17:49.902
No, no!

17:49.904 --> 17:51.236
Baby, no!

17:51.238 --> 17:52.239
Yeah!

17:53.140 --> 17:54.141
Okay, oh!

17:57.244 --> 17:58.245
Yeah, oh!

18:00.247 --> 18:01.248
Oh, yeah!

18:03.116 --> 18:05.985
Oh my god, I love this song.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.420
I got everybody a present.

18:11.659 --> 18:13.793
Beautiful, for you.

18:13.795 --> 18:15.128
Okay, one moment.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.663
Look what I got for you.

18:17.665 --> 18:20.098
It's the color of your eyes.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.300
Oh great, you're way too smart.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.638
And my Dougie,

18:26.941 --> 18:28.676
look what I got you.

18:29.944 --> 18:30.945
Come here!

18:31.946 --> 18:33.280
Okay, okay, okay!

18:34.281 --> 18:36.782
Yeah !

18:40.153 --> 18:41.954
Fuck.

19:41.883 --> 19:42.882
Ma!

19:42.884 --> 19:44.917
Jesus, come down!

19:44.919 --> 19:45.920
I can't.

19:47.922 --> 19:49.023
I can't!

19:51.693 --> 19:53.695
You cannot help me!

19:55.029 --> 19:57.197
You don't fucking help me!

19:58.032 --> 19:59.865
Nobody fucking helps me.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.701
It's not fair.

20:01.703 --> 20:03.370
It's not fucking fair!

20:05.740 --> 20:07.039
It's never enough.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.710
It's never fucking enough!

20:12.446 --> 20:14.446
Hey, can I,

20:14.448 --> 20:16.050
Cathy, can, oh!

20:25.793 --> 20:26.794
Ma!

20:35.136 --> 20:36.902
- For fuck's sake!
- So what now?

20:36.904 --> 20:38.436
Now that the nets work,

20:38.438 --> 20:39.905
what, what, are you gonna stick
your head

20:39.907 --> 20:41.239
in the oven, at the end of every
month?

20:41.241 --> 20:43.408
I don't got a gas oven.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.409
Don't be stupid.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.444
I'm stupid?

20:46.446 --> 20:49.247
Yeah, just set it to a cool 375

20:49.249 --> 20:52.920
and bake my skull like a
Thanksgiving turkey, stupid.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.163
There's a million ways to die,
honey.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.435
Took you a minute, though.

21:14.108 --> 21:15.442
What are you talkin' about?

21:20.447 --> 21:22.950
All I'm sayin' is it
just took you a minute.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.290
Where are you goin'?

21:33.961 --> 21:34.962
To the bathroom.

21:36.130 --> 21:38.130
Don't look at me like that.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.965
When I actually fuckin' go
somewhere,

21:39.967 --> 21:41.301
trust me, you'll know!

21:46.306 --> 21:47.307
Jesus.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.346
Micky!

22:28.348 --> 22:30.348
Micky, Jesus, hey!

22:30.350 --> 22:31.349
I'm talkin' to you.

22:31.351 --> 22:32.350
Here.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.586
Stop it.

22:33.588 --> 22:36.190
Reggie, Reggie, take
your kid, for fuck sakes.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.025
What are you lookin' at, girlie?

22:40.027 --> 22:42.029
Nothing, I'm just shopping.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.035
Yikes.

22:53.541 --> 22:56.210
Why are you here?

23:05.720 --> 23:07.054
Ma, what are you doing?

23:07.922 --> 23:10.289
Uh ,

23:10.291 --> 23:12.124
I gotta talk to you.

23:12.126 --> 23:14.727
It's my one day off.

23:14.729 --> 23:17.062
Yeah, it can't wait, Cathy.

23:17.064 --> 23:18.931
Jesus Christ, one day,

23:18.933 --> 23:21.466
one day to myself, please.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.469
I'm dyin'.

23:25.239 --> 23:26.240
Wait, what?

23:27.074 --> 23:28.142
What, what is this?

23:29.977 --> 23:32.077
Just what I said,

23:32.079 --> 23:35.249
I, I'm dying.

24:05.513 --> 24:07.012
I hate this.

24:07.014 --> 24:08.446
Well, you shoulda thought of
that

24:08.448 --> 24:10.184
before you smoked for 40 years.

24:11.118 --> 24:12.184
You smoke.

24:12.186 --> 24:13.621
Don't be a fuckin' hypocrite.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.122
Tammy MacDonald?

24:18.292 --> 24:19.358
Nice to meet you.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.329
I'm Dr. Miller, your oncologist.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.497
I don't like her.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.533
- Ma.
- Too pretty.

24:27.535 --> 24:29.467
I don't want a pretty doctor.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.468
I'm so sorry.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.037
It's no offense, lady.

24:32.039 --> 24:33.471
I just want to fall apart in
front

24:33.473 --> 24:36.344
of somebody a little less
together.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.480
Well, I'm gonna be frank with
you, Tammy.

24:41.983 --> 24:44.149
You don't have time to shop
around.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.651
Well, that's a harsh
thing

24:45.653 --> 24:48.320
to say to a dying woman.

24:48.322 --> 24:49.555
The cancer is stage
IV.

24:49.557 --> 24:50.656
Hmm.

24:50.658 --> 24:52.658
It's spread to your liver.

24:52.660 --> 24:55.327
Best case scenario, you
have six to ten months,

24:55.329 --> 24:58.065
and the only way to live
that long is with treatment.

25:04.005 --> 25:05.537
What does she have to do?

25:05.539 --> 25:08.340
We should begin chemotherapy
as soon as possible.

25:08.342 --> 25:11.043
The sooner you start, the
more time you'll have.

25:11.045 --> 25:13.014
But ultimately, it's your
decision.

25:16.751 --> 25:18.417
No.

25:18.419 --> 25:20.686
Can we have a little bit
of time to think this over?

25:20.688 --> 25:21.687
Of course.

25:21.689 --> 25:22.855
I do strongly suggest

25:22.857 --> 25:25.190
that you make these decisions
soon, tough.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.425
We will.

25:26.427 --> 25:27.428
Okay.

25:28.696 --> 25:31.098
Let me know
what you decide, okay.

25:33.734 --> 25:38.372
Let me know what you decide.

25:39.774 --> 25:41.273
I don't want no chemo.

25:41.275 --> 25:42.541
I don't know, Ma.

25:42.543 --> 25:45.377
Maybe we should just listen to
the doctor.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.445
Oh, I was listening.

25:46.447 --> 25:48.282
You're the one that wasn't
listenin'.

25:53.621 --> 25:55.120
I need a drink.

25:59.293 --> 26:00.626
Oh , yeah.

26:00.628 --> 26:04.463
Fuck yeah .

26:23.117 --> 26:24.249
Hey.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.584
Hey, Pascal.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.419
Can I get a shot, huh, vodka,
lime?

26:27.421 --> 26:28.422
Sure.

26:31.659 --> 26:33.759
I saw your ma over at Scully's

26:33.761 --> 26:35.496
with some asshole, getting
ripped.

26:37.431 --> 26:38.797
Oh, really?

26:38.799 --> 26:39.798
It's okay.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.300
My ma was a wreck, too,

26:41.302 --> 26:42.601
and I'm just fuckin' fine.

27:10.698 --> 27:14.168
Okay, um, Victoria.

27:15.469 --> 27:17.803
She is a ballet dancer.

27:17.805 --> 27:19.506
What, you want to be a ballerina
again?

27:19.508 --> 27:21.140
Well, you can be someone
you've been before.

27:21.142 --> 27:22.474
There's no rules about that,
right?

27:22.476 --> 27:25.644
No, no, I want someone new.

27:25.646 --> 27:27.181
I'll think of something new.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.982
I'll just get you guys some
drinks, yeah?

27:29.984 --> 27:31.150
No, you know what?

27:31.152 --> 27:32.653
Maybe we should just hold off a
bit, okay?

27:34.488 --> 27:35.489
Yeah.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.894
We should just go home, button.

27:41.896 --> 27:44.331
No, I don't, I don't want to go
home.

27:45.499 --> 27:48.402
We're gonna have to
talk about this at some point.

27:50.004 --> 27:51.405
She wants to die.

27:52.706 --> 27:54.507
Let her die.

27:54.509 --> 27:55.843
Jesus, Cathy, I...

27:56.844 --> 27:59.344
No, I don't want to
talk about it, not here.

27:59.346 --> 28:01.516
I just wanna play the game,
okay?

28:03.918 --> 28:05.252
Okay.

28:13.694 --> 28:15.196
What the fuck?

28:48.429 --> 28:50.062
You have a hole in your wall.

28:50.064 --> 28:51.063
Yeah.

28:51.065 --> 28:52.601
It's the size of a head.

28:53.635 --> 28:56.301
It's the size of my head.

28:56.303 --> 28:57.738
Oh Jesus, Tammy.

28:58.939 --> 28:59.938
So this is it?

28:59.940 --> 29:01.406
This is your life?

29:01.408 --> 29:03.408
You, you just drink rye

29:03.410 --> 29:05.744
and fuck the trash you bring
home?

29:05.746 --> 29:07.479
We're all trash.

29:07.481 --> 29:08.914
Well, at least some of us have a
sense

29:08.916 --> 29:10.617
of fuckin' decency about it.

29:10.619 --> 29:11.618
Oh .

29:16.457 --> 29:19.091
We got to talk about your
treatment.

29:19.093 --> 29:20.761
- No.
- Tammy!

29:21.929 --> 29:23.495
I'm scared to be sick.

29:23.497 --> 29:25.264
You've always been sick.

29:25.266 --> 29:28.603
This time, you're just
sick with cancer .

29:30.639 --> 29:31.640
What about Cathy?

29:32.773 --> 29:34.507
You have a responsibility to
her.

29:34.509 --> 29:36.609
You never take that seriously.

29:36.611 --> 29:38.777
- I do.
- No, you don't.

29:38.779 --> 29:40.848
Well, it's no help you being
around.

29:41.949 --> 29:44.116
And you make it so fuckin' hard.

29:44.118 --> 29:45.518
- Me?
- Yeah.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.853
I can't compete with you.

29:47.855 --> 29:52.457
You, you come in here with
your suits and your hotels,

29:52.459 --> 29:54.960
and you make it look like I,
you know, I don't even try.

29:54.962 --> 29:56.629
'Cause you don't.

29:56.631 --> 29:57.963
I could.

29:57.965 --> 29:59.831
If you'd just give me some
time with her, I could.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.801
You want time with her?

30:02.803 --> 30:03.804
Okay.

30:04.639 --> 30:07.472
Oh, I'll give you time with her.

30:07.474 --> 30:10.142
But you got to listen to the
doctor.

30:10.144 --> 30:12.813
And you have to promise to
be good to your daughter.

30:16.817 --> 30:19.818
Yeah, I'll do my best.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.988
No, more than that.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.491
You have to go out a better
woman.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.996
Now have some tea.

30:42.510 --> 30:43.511
It's real.

30:44.845 --> 30:47.846
It's the real thing, Cathy.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.350
- Mm-hmm.
- She needs you.

30:55.055 --> 30:56.056
Right.

32:10.799 --> 32:11.800
Fuck.

32:22.142 --> 32:24.109
I'm gonna make you pee in
your little uniform .

32:24.111 --> 32:26.278
She told me you moved in with
her.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.781
Yeah, we don't have a lot of
money,

32:28.783 --> 32:32.451
so we figured we'd pool our
resources,

32:32.453 --> 32:34.019
well, my resources.

32:34.021 --> 32:35.788
She doesn't have any resources.

32:35.790 --> 32:38.524
So it's like a, a puddle,

32:38.526 --> 32:41.159
a puddle of my resources.

32:41.161 --> 32:42.695
There is government assistance.

32:42.697 --> 32:44.996
I make too much money to get any
help

32:44.998 --> 32:48.133
and too little to pay for any,
so...

32:48.135 --> 32:50.503
Government-subsidized home care.

32:50.505 --> 32:53.806
I don't see her playing
too well with others.

32:53.808 --> 32:56.308
She's too proud.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.976
Grief counseling.

32:57.978 --> 32:59.478
Took enough convincing to get
her here.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.816
I really don't think
that therapy's an option.

33:02.983 --> 33:04.151
I didn't mean for her.

33:06.487 --> 33:07.488
Oh.

33:09.323 --> 33:10.658
I'm good, thanks.

33:29.911 --> 33:31.078
You're having a party.

33:33.013 --> 33:34.547
I fuckin' see you,

33:34.549 --> 33:37.015
in my fuckin' shed when
my fuckin' kids are home.

33:37.017 --> 33:38.686
What kind of woman are you, hmm?

33:39.554 --> 33:40.853
The only difference between you
and me is

33:40.855 --> 33:42.053
that I fuckin' kept mine, and
you didn't,

33:42.055 --> 33:43.255
so don't think for one second

33:43.257 --> 33:44.924
that it couldn't be the other
way around.

33:44.926 --> 33:46.191
Okay.

33:46.193 --> 33:47.194
Thanks.

33:48.897 --> 33:50.865
He's not your fuckin'
prince.

34:20.093 --> 34:21.963
Like a fuckin' funeral.

34:25.733 --> 34:26.899
Oh, hot, that's fuckin' hot.

34:26.901 --> 34:29.401
Oh, it's fuckin' fine.
Mm-mm.

34:29.403 --> 34:30.970
Don't be a baby, come here.

34:30.972 --> 34:33.071
Well, don't treat me like one.

34:33.073 --> 34:35.073
I can take a bath by myself, you
know?

34:35.075 --> 34:36.076
Well...

34:36.911 --> 34:37.910
Okay?

34:37.912 --> 34:38.913
Fine.

34:42.650 --> 34:43.783
Jesus Christ, Mom.

34:43.785 --> 34:45.317
Alright.

34:45.319 --> 34:47.753
You made your fuckin' point.

34:47.755 --> 34:49.624
Okay, down, down, down.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.260
Ah!

34:53.995 --> 34:55.628
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.996
Alright.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.764
Oh.

34:58.766 --> 35:00.131
Okay.

35:06.306 --> 35:09.609
You just gonna watch me, eh?

35:09.611 --> 35:13.278
Just perv out over there on the
can?

35:13.280 --> 35:15.115
Do you think that I want to be
here?

35:17.785 --> 35:20.151
No, no, I do not.

35:22.356 --> 35:25.024
Get off the can in case I gotta
puke.

35:25.026 --> 35:26.027
Thank you.

35:29.030 --> 35:30.130
Ah.

35:32.132 --> 35:37.137
Hey, "The Nutcracker" is on
at the community center soon.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.039
What?

35:40.041 --> 35:41.206
"The Nutcracker," I thought,

35:41.208 --> 35:44.144
I thought we could go, like the
two of us.

35:46.981 --> 35:49.147
I don't want to go to
"The Nutcracker," Ma.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.148
You sure?

35:50.150 --> 35:52.150
You used to love to go and laugh

35:52.152 --> 35:53.318
at all the little fat kids.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.319
No, I didn't.

35:54.321 --> 35:56.354
Yeah, yeah.

35:56.356 --> 35:57.723
We'd have a couple drinks,

35:57.725 --> 36:00.325
and we'd go and laugh at the fat
kids.

36:00.327 --> 36:01.727
That wasn't me.

36:01.729 --> 36:02.995
Sure?

36:02.997 --> 36:04.229
Yeah, Ma, I'm sure.

36:04.231 --> 36:06.999
I was in "The Nutcracker"
when I was little.

36:07.001 --> 36:08.000
I was in it.

36:08.002 --> 36:09.003
Oh.

36:10.905 --> 36:11.906
Were you fat?

36:13.240 --> 36:14.239
Yeah.

36:14.241 --> 36:16.842
Oh , shit.

36:16.844 --> 36:17.845
Yeah, shit.

36:21.015 --> 36:23.181
It wasn't nothin' towards you.

36:23.183 --> 36:24.182
It wasn't.

36:24.184 --> 36:26.351
I, I'm sure you were great.

36:26.353 --> 36:30.190
I'm sure I was so proud of you.

36:35.228 --> 36:36.227
Dougie'll take you.

36:36.229 --> 36:37.732
He loves the ballet.

36:39.701 --> 36:43.368
Hm, you like him more than me.

36:43.370 --> 36:44.369
No, I don't.

36:44.371 --> 36:45.905
Yeah, you do.

36:45.907 --> 36:50.912
Well, he's, he's fun.

36:53.047 --> 36:54.714
He's fun?

36:54.716 --> 36:55.715
I'm fun.

36:55.717 --> 36:57.215
I taught that guy how to be fun.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.216
Right.

36:58.218 --> 36:59.217
I did.

36:59.219 --> 37:02.888
He used to just be this sad,

37:02.890 --> 37:06.391
- black, gay kid with asthma.
- I get it, Ma.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.394
I get it.

37:10.932 --> 37:12.734
So you don't wanna go?

37:16.403 --> 37:17.737
No.

What the fuck, Cathy?

38:24.038 --> 38:26.172
What are you doing on the floor?

38:26.174 --> 38:27.975
It was fucking hot.

38:28.976 --> 38:32.011
I thought you were, I thought
you were,

38:32.013 --> 38:33.012
I thought you were...

38:33.014 --> 38:34.647
What, dead?

38:34.649 --> 38:39.051
Jesus, well, don't look so
fuckin' excited about it.

38:42.890 --> 38:44.158
Borrowed your underwear.

39:02.409 --> 39:03.911
We need to cut your hair.

39:04.679 --> 39:05.678
No, I like my hair.

39:05.680 --> 39:07.014
I like it long.

39:08.348 --> 39:11.018
Ma, it looks kinda...

39:12.854 --> 39:14.220
- What?
- Nothing.

39:14.222 --> 39:15.221
Never mind.

39:15.223 --> 39:17.525
I'm not gonna fight with you.

39:19.260 --> 39:23.229
Remember when you played
the flute?

39:23.231 --> 39:25.197
- What?
- The flute,

39:25.199 --> 39:27.533
the fuckin' flute?

39:28.536 --> 39:30.102
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

39:30.104 --> 39:32.370
- I remember.
- Yeah, you were awful.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.373
Yeah, well, it didn't last long.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.374
No, it did not.

39:36.376 --> 39:38.210
'Cause I was bad at it.

39:38.212 --> 39:41.213
Yeah, and you quit,
'cause you're a quitter.

39:41.215 --> 39:42.380
Yeah.

39:42.382 --> 39:44.116
I never met a person so fast to
run away.

39:44.118 --> 39:45.553
There's no fight to ya.

39:49.624 --> 39:50.892
Fuck you.

39:52.392 --> 39:53.393
What?

39:54.929 --> 39:55.928
I'm here, aren't I?

39:55.930 --> 39:57.131
I'm fucking here.

39:58.933 --> 39:59.934

40:01.135 --> 40:02.568
I'm sorry.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.136
I'm tryin' here, Cathy.

40:04.138 --> 40:05.239
I really am.

40:08.475 --> 40:09.476
I know.

40:13.413 --> 40:15.415
Hey, I'm trying, too.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.789
Here's your candy.

40:40.007 --> 40:41.008
Okay.

40:45.613 --> 40:46.614
No.

40:48.481 --> 40:49.480
Hmm?

41:55.683 --> 41:57.349
You guys going?

41:57.351 --> 42:00.019
Alright, I'll see you
tomorrow.

42:00.021 --> 42:01.186
- Have a good day.
- Yeah, I'll be back.

42:01.188 --> 42:02.187
Bye, get home safe,

42:02.189 --> 42:03.188
- alright?
- Yeah, see you, hun.

42:03.190 --> 42:05.726
See you, sweetheart.

42:06.694 --> 42:08.427
Button, how are you?

42:08.429 --> 42:09.695
How's, how's your mom?

42:09.697 --> 42:12.564
Oh, uh, she's, she's fine,

42:12.566 --> 42:15.603
just hard and fine, but I was
thinkin',

42:16.704 --> 42:18.570
Sunday, you and me?

42:18.572 --> 42:19.740
No, I don't think so.

42:21.275 --> 42:22.775
What?

42:22.777 --> 42:25.377
Why don't you do something
with your ma, something nice?

42:25.379 --> 42:26.378
I don't want to.

42:26.380 --> 42:27.546
I want to go to the hotel.

42:27.548 --> 42:28.881
Oh Catherine, you're a little
old

42:28.883 --> 42:30.416
to pretend to be a ballerina,

42:30.418 --> 42:32.219
every time shit gets hard.

42:33.054 --> 42:34.787
But you're the one who
taught me how to do that.

42:34.789 --> 42:36.057
Yeah, I know.

42:39.226 --> 42:41.126
Let me take over, huh?

42:41.128 --> 42:42.795
I was just gonna go upstairs
and watch TV, anyway.

42:42.797 --> 42:44.396
You can have the rest of the
night off.

42:44.398 --> 42:45.399
No, it's okay.

42:46.567 --> 42:48.634
- Cathy, I...
- It's fine.

42:48.636 --> 42:50.237
I would rather be here.

43:02.750 --> 43:04.149
<i>She told me she know me.</i>

43:04.151 --> 43:05.918
<i>She don't know me.</i>

43:05.920 --> 43:07.920
<i>She comin' up in here and
talkin' all kinds of bullshit,</i>

43:07.922 --> 43:10.089
<i>talkin' about she know me.</i>

43:10.091 --> 43:11.090
<i>She don't know me.</i>

43:11.092 --> 43:12.426
<i>I don't know her.</i>

43:27.775 --> 43:29.143
Motherfucker.

43:41.455 --> 43:44.524
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

43:44.526 --> 43:46.794
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

44:09.717 --> 44:10.718
Okay.

44:14.388 --> 44:15.389
Okay.

44:53.528 --> 44:54.860
Excuse me, little one.

44:54.862 --> 44:56.929
Someone is out there fuckin' up
your ride.

44:56.931 --> 44:58.430
What?

45:00.401 --> 45:02.367
Oh what the fuck are you...

45:02.369 --> 45:04.036
Oh my god!

45:04.038 --> 45:05.574
Fuck you, skank!

45:08.709 --> 45:10.244
My fucking car.

45:13.414 --> 45:14.415
Hey!

45:16.618 --> 45:17.617
What the hell, Cathy?

45:17.619 --> 45:18.717
My kids are sleeping.

45:18.719 --> 45:19.885
Look at this.

45:19.887 --> 45:20.886
What?

45:20.888 --> 45:21.887
What?

45:21.889 --> 45:22.888
This!

45:22.890 --> 45:23.956
Who did that?

45:23.958 --> 45:25.791
Oh my god, take a fucking guess,
Reggie.

45:25.793 --> 45:27.728
Oh shit.

45:29.396 --> 45:30.729
Are you laughing?

45:30.731 --> 45:31.730
Don't you fucking laugh.

45:31.732 --> 45:32.731
Don't you fucking dare laugh.

45:32.733 --> 45:33.932
What do you want me to do about
it?

45:33.934 --> 45:35.968
I want you to call off your
fucking dog.

45:35.970 --> 45:37.269
Hey, now that is the mother

45:37.271 --> 45:38.571
of my children you're talkin'
about.

45:38.573 --> 45:39.905
Well, then she should be writing
skank

45:39.907 --> 45:41.907
on the side of your fuckin'
vehicle.

45:41.909 --> 45:42.941
Weren't you gonna get a new car?

45:42.943 --> 45:44.810
That's not the fucking point.

45:44.812 --> 45:45.944
Then who gives a shit what's
written

45:45.946 --> 45:47.248
on a pile of garbage?

45:48.583 --> 45:50.816
Fuck you, Reggie.

45:50.818 --> 45:51.651
Fuck me?

45:51.653 --> 45:52.585
Fuck you, Cathy!

45:52.587 --> 45:53.752
You're the one that calls me.

45:53.754 --> 45:54.820
You're the one that pulls me
into the shed

45:54.822 --> 45:56.088
when my wife and children are at
home.

45:56.090 --> 45:57.089
Don't you dare.

45:57.091 --> 45:58.257
Don't you dare put this all on
me.

45:58.259 --> 45:59.424
Do you like me?

45:59.426 --> 46:00.325
What does that have to do with
anything?

46:00.327 --> 46:01.460
Do you think she likes me?

46:01.462 --> 46:03.428
I don't know.

46:03.430 --> 46:04.429
You want me to leave her?

46:04.431 --> 46:06.765
No , god, no.

46:06.767 --> 46:07.933
Then take your lumps.

46:07.935 --> 46:08.936
She does.

46:13.941 --> 46:15.440
You're a piece of shit, Reggie.

46:15.442 --> 46:16.441
Yeah.

46:16.443 --> 46:17.978
That's the only reason you like
me.

46:19.514 --> 46:22.114
What am I supposed to
do about my fucking car?

46:22.116 --> 46:23.817
Don't know, not my problem.

46:25.019 --> 46:26.018
- Get a paint job.
- Nice.

46:26.020 --> 46:27.786
Oh fuck off.

46:27.788 --> 46:28.789
Paint job.

46:50.712 --> 46:51.713
Hmm?

47:02.856 --> 47:03.824
Hmm?

47:19.541 --> 47:20.673
Fuck.

47:20.675 --> 47:21.676
Shit!

47:23.511 --> 47:25.511
I broke the wall.

47:25.513 --> 47:27.012
Oh fuckin' hell, Ma.

47:27.014 --> 47:29.416
I, I fixed it, and then I
broke it,

47:30.685 --> 47:32.518
and that is always the way.

47:32.520 --> 47:35.020
Yeah, it is.

47:35.022 --> 47:36.855
Alright, okay, help me out
here.

47:36.857 --> 47:38.593
Ah, ow!

47:39.860 --> 47:40.861
Oh!

47:41.596 --> 47:42.595
Oh god.

47:42.597 --> 47:43.598
- Oh!
- Alright.

47:45.032 --> 47:46.532
I, uh...

47:46.534 --> 47:47.533
I know, Ma.

47:47.535 --> 47:48.867
Oh, I did somethin'.

47:48.869 --> 47:50.435
Yeah, I fuckin' know.

47:50.437 --> 47:51.903
You don't.

47:51.905 --> 47:53.575
- Let's get you to bed.
- Okay.

47:54.942 --> 47:57.376
I need you to tell me I'm a good
person.

47:57.378 --> 48:00.112
You're a good person.

48:00.114 --> 48:01.549
Okay.

48:06.453 --> 48:07.454
Oh my god, Mom.

48:08.723 --> 48:11.089
You look like him.

48:11.091 --> 48:14.627
Who?

48:14.629 --> 48:15.630
Oh.

48:16.598 --> 48:17.599
One of 'em.

48:26.574 --> 48:27.908
Oh god, I need,

48:29.644 --> 48:31.243
I need to...

49:34.308 --> 49:35.675
Now jump.

49:37.978 --> 49:40.680
Come on, get dressed
for your fuckin' chemo.

49:40.682 --> 49:42.047
Cathy.

49:55.062 --> 49:56.228
What?

49:56.230 --> 49:58.230
I mean, I don't know what to
say.

49:58.232 --> 49:59.732
Your mother could be around a
bit longer

49:59.734 --> 50:00.835
than we anticipated.

50:01.669 --> 50:04.236
Now this isn't to say the cancer
is gone.

50:04.238 --> 50:07.507
But she's responding
really well to the chemo.

50:07.509 --> 50:09.575
Isn't this the most fun you've
ever had

50:09.577 --> 50:11.011
with your clothes on ?

50:12.580 --> 50:13.848
It is, isn't it?

50:14.883 --> 50:17.349
Oh my god, my poor daughter.

50:17.351 --> 50:18.918
You should come and visit.

50:23.056 --> 50:24.024
Oh.

50:25.192 --> 50:27.862
Christ, that shit makes me so
nauseated.

50:34.536 --> 50:35.935
How fucking dare you.

50:35.937 --> 50:37.870
What'd I do now?

50:37.872 --> 50:40.205
At the bar, at the hospital,

50:40.207 --> 50:42.742
pretending to be a good fucking
person.

50:42.744 --> 50:44.276
I'm not a good person.

50:44.278 --> 50:45.547
I'm a good time.

50:47.882 --> 50:49.047
I coulda left.

50:49.049 --> 50:50.716
Oh, really?

50:50.718 --> 50:54.887
And done what, been a fat
ballerina,

50:54.889 --> 50:57.255
played the fucking flute?

50:57.257 --> 50:58.724
What, what would you have done?

50:58.726 --> 50:59.459
Stop.

51:00.562 --> 51:01.596
- I could've...
- You could have, huh?

51:02.730 --> 51:05.096
Nothin', no, nothin', takin'
care

51:05.098 --> 51:07.600
of me is the only thing
you've ever been good at.

51:07.602 --> 51:10.605
I mean, name one thing, one
thing you ever been good at.

51:13.608 --> 51:16.241
We exist on a planet filled with
people,

51:16.243 --> 51:18.911
and some of 'em are nothin'.

51:18.913 --> 51:20.646
We are those people, you know.

51:20.648 --> 51:23.116
We are nothing people.

51:31.759 --> 51:32.925
Why don't...

51:32.927 --> 51:34.159
Why what?

51:34.161 --> 51:37.164
Why won't you just

51:40.167 --> 51:41.168
die?

51:43.004 --> 51:46.271
Why won't you just fucking die?

51:52.614 --> 51:55.113
Get out of the car.

51:55.115 --> 51:57.783
Get out of the car, get out of
the car.

51:57.785 --> 51:59.284
Get out of the car.

51:59.286 --> 52:00.318
Hey.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.622
You can't, you can't...

52:02.624 --> 52:03.789
Get out of the car!

52:03.791 --> 52:04.792
Alright.

52:05.359 --> 52:07.629
Jesus, it's in a puddle.

52:40.828 --> 52:41.829
Fuck.

53:33.380 --> 53:35.380
<i>My name is Catherine MacDonald,</i>

53:35.382 --> 53:38.283
<i>and I want to be on
"The Gordon Baker Show."</i>

53:38.285 --> 53:40.086
<i>For years, my mother used to try</i>

53:40.088 --> 53:42.955
<i>to throw herself off a
bridge, and I always had</i>

53:42.957 --> 53:45.059
<i>to talk her down, because she
needed me.</i>

53:46.060 --> 53:47.893
<i>But now she's dead.</i>

53:47.895 --> 53:49.764
<i>She died of cancer.</i>

53:50.932 --> 53:52.900
<i>And I want my tragedy to have
value.</i>

54:00.407 --> 54:03.075
Button, you're not
scheduled till Thursday.

54:03.077 --> 54:04.309
- I'm leaving.
- What?

54:04.311 --> 54:05.911
I'm going to the city.

54:05.913 --> 54:06.912
For how long?

54:06.914 --> 54:08.246
The rest of my life.

54:08.248 --> 54:09.247
Honey, you can't.

54:09.249 --> 54:10.783
Like hell I can't.

54:10.785 --> 54:11.784
Oh come on, Cathy,

54:11.786 --> 54:12.785
- you gotta understand.
- No.

54:12.787 --> 54:13.919
I'm not listening to you.

54:13.921 --> 54:15.420
You don't know shit.

54:15.422 --> 54:17.322
You give her booze when she's
happy

54:17.324 --> 54:19.125
and food when she's
sad, but you don't know.

54:19.127 --> 54:20.926
You don't know what she's like.

54:20.928 --> 54:22.094
This isn't about her.

54:22.096 --> 54:23.763
This is about the woman you
become

54:23.765 --> 54:25.099
when this shit is all over.

54:26.333 --> 54:27.432
What about the woman I am now?

54:27.434 --> 54:28.435
What about her?

54:32.272 --> 54:34.108
Yeah, that's what I thought.

54:36.010 --> 54:37.342
You know what?

54:37.344 --> 54:40.478
Killing herself would be
the least selfish thing

54:40.480 --> 54:41.816
she's ever done!

55:12.013 --> 55:13.145
Good afternoon, my lady.

55:13.147 --> 55:14.816
Would you like a seat at the,
um...

55:16.483 --> 55:17.484
Everything okay?

55:18.986 --> 55:20.186
I need a room.

55:20.188 --> 55:22.655
That's not really my
job.

55:22.657 --> 55:23.825
I know.

55:26.493 --> 55:28.062
I only have $84.

55:29.329 --> 55:31.232
Like, in the world?

55:32.667 --> 55:33.835
Yeah.

55:35.503 --> 55:38.671
Alright, welcome to mi casa.

55:38.673 --> 55:43.177
Uh, it's tiny, but I work a
lot, so I won't bother you.

55:44.178 --> 55:45.410
Shoes off, please.

55:45.412 --> 55:46.881
Oh, sorry about the crap.

55:48.348 --> 55:50.516
<i>♪ Bom, bah ♪</i>

55:50.518 --> 55:52.184
Yeah.

55:52.186 --> 55:53.353
- Uh...
- Wow.

55:54.188 --> 55:55.189
This is you.

55:56.858 --> 55:59.193
Luckily, you get a pullout
couch.

56:00.027 --> 56:01.026
That's great.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.027
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

56:02.029 --> 56:03.030
- Thanks.
- No problem.

56:04.599 --> 56:06.098
Yeah, that's the tour .

56:06.100 --> 56:07.535
- It's nice.
- Mm.

56:08.536 --> 56:11.203
Jamie, you really don't have to
do this.

56:11.205 --> 56:12.204
Sure, I do.

56:12.206 --> 56:13.205
I like you.

56:13.207 --> 56:14.206
You're nice.

56:14.208 --> 56:15.209
You're a nice person.

56:18.713 --> 56:19.712
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:19.714 --> 56:21.080
Thank you.

56:21.082 --> 56:22.083
That's alright.

56:49.243 --> 56:51.409
Sorry for your loss.

56:54.481 --> 56:55.482
Hmm.

56:57.652 --> 56:59.151
<i>Yes, she's in a meeting
right now.</i>

56:59.153 --> 57:00.819
<i>If you'd like to leave a
message,</i>

57:00.821 --> 57:04.156
<i>or would you like me to
transfer you to her voicemail?</i>

57:04.158 --> 57:05.624
<i>Yes, why don't I do that?</i>

57:05.626 --> 57:08.260
<i>Okay, I'll put you through to
her office.</i>

57:08.262 --> 57:10.129
<i>Where's my line at five?</i>

57:10.131 --> 57:12.264
Ms. Weisman's ready for you now.

57:12.266 --> 57:13.267
Okay.

57:38.359 --> 57:39.360
Ms. Weisman?

57:41.461 --> 57:42.462
Catherine.

57:44.131 --> 57:45.132
Sit.

57:53.140 --> 57:56.644
So my assistant tells me you
have a story for the show.

58:24.672 --> 58:26.171
Cathy!

58:26.173 --> 58:27.341
- Cath!
- What?

58:28.676 --> 58:29.677
Doug's here again.

58:31.345 --> 58:33.178
- Jamie, no.
- Okay.

58:33.180 --> 58:34.179
- Tell him...
- Okay, okay.

58:34.181 --> 58:35.180
I don't care what.

58:35.182 --> 58:36.183
Yeah.

58:42.356 --> 58:44.356
Sorry, Doug, she doesn't want to
come out.

58:44.358 --> 58:45.357
Alright.

58:45.359 --> 58:46.358
You have a good one.

58:46.360 --> 58:48.029
- Yeah.
- Alright, take care.

58:56.537 --> 58:57.603
There's tissues, right there.

58:57.605 --> 58:58.606
Okay.

59:10.384 --> 59:11.717
I, I don't know what's
happening.

59:11.719 --> 59:13.118
I cry all the time.

59:13.120 --> 59:15.056
Don't worry, tears will come.

59:17.625 --> 59:19.727
Maybe try to fold into yourself
more.

59:23.264 --> 59:24.396
That's better.

59:24.398 --> 59:25.397
Are you comfortable?

59:25.399 --> 59:26.432
- Not really.
- Good.

59:26.434 --> 59:28.569
Now, what do you want to start
with?

59:29.737 --> 59:31.070
- Leaving.
- No, no,

59:31.072 --> 59:32.404
don't start at the end.

59:32.406 --> 59:33.739
Okay.

59:33.741 --> 59:36.575
Maybe the drinking or the
suicide.

59:36.577 --> 59:38.412
Or the men.

59:39.246 --> 59:41.115
But that's, um...

59:41.816 --> 59:43.084
What?

59:45.586 --> 59:47.655
Well, that's, that's all about
her.

59:48.656 --> 59:49.657
And?

59:52.293 --> 59:53.627
Well, I thought that they,

59:56.330 --> 59:58.764
I thought that they
wanted to hear about me.

59:58.766 --> 1:00:01.268
Oh, they do, honey, just not
yet.

1:00:03.604 --> 1:00:04.605
Hm.

1:00:05.639 --> 1:00:08.674
There, there she is.

1:00:08.676 --> 1:00:10.778
There's the broken girl we need
to see.

1:00:11.645 --> 1:00:13.278
I have something for you.

1:00:21.789 --> 1:00:23.956
Just a small token of our
appreciation,

1:00:23.958 --> 1:00:26.627
but if the show goes
well, there'll be more.

1:00:36.303 --> 1:00:37.304
Thank you.

1:00:38.839 --> 1:00:39.840
Wow.

1:00:41.709 --> 1:00:43.642
You are welcome.

1:00:45.646 --> 1:00:46.979
Just take a look around?

1:00:46.981 --> 1:00:48.149
Just see.

1:01:11.005 --> 1:01:12.406
This is the one.

1:01:16.578 --> 1:01:19.845
Okay, so I'm just going
to feather it a bit.

1:01:21.048 --> 1:01:23.751
I'm gonna give you my
specialty, Mia Farrow.

1:01:28.355 --> 1:01:29.688
You saw her.

1:01:29.690 --> 1:01:30.756
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

1:01:30.758 --> 1:01:31.759
Yeah, she looks great.

1:01:33.528 --> 1:01:37.532
You know, she's, she
looks fresh-faced, shiny.

1:01:38.899 --> 1:01:40.201
She's got a good job,

1:01:40.935 --> 1:01:41.934
good friends, too.

1:01:41.936 --> 1:01:43.204
They're good people.

1:01:44.606 --> 1:01:46.405
So she's happy?

1:01:46.407 --> 1:01:47.708
Yeah, yeah, she's great.

1:01:54.549 --> 1:01:55.550
It's all my fault.

1:01:58.719 --> 1:01:59.920
It's always been my fault.

1:02:02.223 --> 1:02:04.890
Tammy, you are not the center
of everyone's universe.

1:02:04.892 --> 1:02:05.891
Oh thank you.

1:02:05.893 --> 1:02:06.892
No, she's happy.

1:02:06.894 --> 1:02:07.895
She's fine.

1:02:27.982 --> 1:02:29.250
No.

1:02:30.251 --> 1:02:31.416
Oh god.

1:02:49.604 --> 1:02:51.770
Oh, uh, I forgot to tell you.

1:02:51.772 --> 1:02:52.971
Doug came by the bar again.

1:02:52.973 --> 1:02:54.339
Stop telling me about that.

1:02:54.341 --> 1:02:56.008
He just wants to talk to you.

1:02:57.945 --> 1:02:58.944
You okay?

1:02:58.946 --> 1:02:59.947
What'd you do to your face?

1:03:00.814 --> 1:03:03.683
Oh .

1:03:03.685 --> 1:03:04.952
I can't cry.

1:03:06.787 --> 1:03:07.786
Okay.

1:03:07.788 --> 1:03:08.854
I used to cry all the time,

1:03:08.856 --> 1:03:09.955
and now I can't even do that.

1:03:09.957 --> 1:03:11.823
Why do you need to cry

1:03:11.825 --> 1:03:12.793
For the show.

1:03:14.795 --> 1:03:16.795
Cathy, you don't need
to cry for those people.

1:03:16.797 --> 1:03:17.796
Yes, I do.

1:03:17.798 --> 1:03:18.864
That's what they want.

1:03:18.866 --> 1:03:20.635
Nobody wants to see me be fine.

1:03:22.469 --> 1:03:23.470
Okay.

1:03:24.471 --> 1:03:26.138
- Jamie.
- Mm-hmm.

1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:27.507
Haven't you ever wanted your
life

1:03:27.509 --> 1:03:29.009
to really mean something?

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.482
Honestly, I've never
really thought about that.

1:03:36.850 --> 1:03:39.719
You've always just been happy?

1:03:39.721 --> 1:03:40.988
Yeah, for the most part.

1:03:42.056 --> 1:03:43.658
I've always just been happy.

1:03:45.059 --> 1:03:46.327
Wow.

1:03:47.662 --> 1:03:48.661
That's insane.

1:03:50.331 --> 1:03:52.665
Oh <i>.</i>

1:03:56.504 --> 1:03:59.505
<i>For the
24-in-one chopper, call now.</i>

1:04:15.523 --> 1:04:18.760
<i>Tracy, do you
know who the father is?</i>

1:04:20.562 --> 1:04:21.728
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:04:24.699 --> 1:04:25.698
<i>Does that make
you worry</i>

1:04:25.700 --> 1:04:26.900
<i>about raising this child?</i>

1:04:28.035 --> 1:04:29.034
<i>Yes.</i>

1:04:29.036 --> 1:04:30.035
<i>It's okay.</i>

1:04:30.037 --> 1:04:31.036
<i>You can let go.</i>

1:04:34.709 --> 1:04:35.710
<i>Let it all out.</i>

1:04:37.044 --> 1:04:38.546
<i>You're in a safe space here.</i>

1:04:43.585 --> 1:04:46.918
Catherine, the show is tomorrow.

1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:48.887
This is a problem.

1:04:48.889 --> 1:04:51.390
If you can't cry, we're
gonna have to find other ways

1:04:51.392 --> 1:04:53.058
to up the ante of your
victimhood.

1:04:53.060 --> 1:04:54.061
How?

1:05:01.068 --> 1:05:02.069
I've got it.

1:05:02.936 --> 1:05:04.102
Doug.

1:05:04.104 --> 1:05:05.137
Doug?

1:05:05.139 --> 1:05:06.438
Did he touch you?

1:05:06.440 --> 1:05:07.439
What?

1:05:07.441 --> 1:05:08.440
Could he have?

1:05:08.442 --> 1:05:10.643
No, absolutely not.

1:05:10.645 --> 1:05:12.612
It's odd, right?

1:05:12.614 --> 1:05:15.113
A grown man, not a blood
relative,

1:05:15.115 --> 1:05:18.150
hanging out with a little
girl, taking her to bars.

1:05:18.152 --> 1:05:19.752
No.

1:05:19.754 --> 1:05:23.422
Look, you can either be the hero

1:05:23.424 --> 1:05:25.424
or the victim of this narrative.

1:05:25.426 --> 1:05:27.159
And honey, you're a bummer.

1:05:27.161 --> 1:05:29.096
And bummers aren't heroes.

1:05:34.435 --> 1:05:36.168
How do we fix that?

1:05:36.170 --> 1:05:38.504
If you refuse to go there,

1:05:38.506 --> 1:05:42.508
you'll have to break in front
of them, full waterworks.

1:05:42.510 --> 1:05:44.943
How you get there is your
business.

1:06:12.807 --> 1:06:15.040
<i>How many of you
have experienced this?</i>

1:06:15.042 --> 1:06:19.645
<i>Yes, yes, oh, don't be
shy, put your hand up.</i>

1:06:19.647 --> 1:06:20.813
<i>You are in a safe, comfortable
space...</i>

1:06:20.815 --> 1:06:22.981
I saw your episode yesterday.

1:06:22.983 --> 1:06:24.151
You were great.

1:06:25.185 --> 1:06:26.485
What is wrong with you?

1:06:27.988 --> 1:06:29.354
<i>There is beauty
in pain, and I say that</i>

1:06:29.356 --> 1:06:31.189
<i>to a lot of people, and they
doubt me.</i>

1:06:31.191 --> 1:06:33.693
<i>But on this show, you're
going to see the beautiful...</i>

1:06:33.695 --> 1:06:35.227
Go change.

1:06:35.229 --> 1:06:36.495
<i>Do you know why?</i>

1:06:36.497 --> 1:06:37.996
<i>Because on the other side of
pain...</i>

1:06:38.999 --> 1:06:40.666
Psst, psst!

1:06:40.668 --> 1:06:41.667
Over here!

1:06:41.669 --> 1:06:42.668
No!
I forgot!

1:06:44.873 --> 1:06:45.907
Let your hair down.

1:06:47.040 --> 1:06:48.240
Yeah.

1:06:48.242 --> 1:06:50.175
Okay, now don't be nervous.

1:06:50.177 --> 1:06:51.176
Just be yourself.

1:06:51.178 --> 1:06:53.178
This isn't me, though.

1:06:53.180 --> 1:06:54.179
Well, then be this girl.

1:06:54.181 --> 1:06:55.247
You ready?

1:06:56.684 --> 1:06:57.717
Yeah.

1:06:57.719 --> 1:06:58.718
You'll do great.

1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:00.185
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:07:00.187 --> 1:07:05.090
our next guest is a woman
who has no education,

1:07:05.092 --> 1:07:10.063
no romantic partnerships,
no friends, no life,

1:07:10.765 --> 1:07:14.199
and had a suicidal and alcoholic
mother.

1:07:14.201 --> 1:07:16.869
So let's give a big welcome
to Catherine MacDonald.

1:07:16.871 --> 1:07:18.069
Go, go.

1:07:21.041 --> 1:07:23.578
Yes, let's keep that applause
going.

1:07:25.212 --> 1:07:28.716
Thank you, Catherine, take a
seat there.

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:34.787
Thank you for being here.

1:07:34.789 --> 1:07:36.722
Thank you for having me.

1:07:36.724 --> 1:07:38.960
So tell us about your mother.

1:07:41.729 --> 1:07:44.396
Well, first, I think it's
important

1:07:44.398 --> 1:07:45.598
to understand how I...

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:47.234
Yes, yes, you.

1:07:48.570 --> 1:07:50.572
But before we get to you,
Catherine,

1:07:51.238 --> 1:07:53.271
let's talk a little bit about
your mother,

1:07:53.273 --> 1:07:57.244
a volatile woman, an addict,
impulsive.

1:07:58.111 --> 1:07:59.581
Tell us about the bridge.

1:08:00.648 --> 1:08:03.783
Well, there was a, uh, a bridge.

1:08:03.785 --> 1:08:06.284
She would try to jump off of it.

1:08:07.589 --> 1:08:10.088
That was before she was
diagnosed with cancer?

1:08:10.090 --> 1:08:11.258
Yeah, before.

1:08:13.928 --> 1:08:15.763
And then you had to watch her
die.

1:08:17.765 --> 1:08:19.099
You had to watch her die.

1:08:20.668 --> 1:08:23.270
Slowly, painfully,

1:08:24.438 --> 1:08:25.640
you watched her die.

1:08:28.442 --> 1:08:31.777
No, that's not what happened.

1:08:34.949 --> 1:08:38.116
No, I mean, she had cancer, but
that's,

1:08:38.118 --> 1:08:39.621
that's not how she died.

1:08:45.026 --> 1:08:47.292
Then how did she die?

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:54.466
The bridge.

1:08:57.337 --> 1:08:58.640
She went to the bridge.

1:09:02.476 --> 1:09:06.313
I saw her,

1:09:07.715 --> 1:09:09.147
and she was someone else.

1:09:09.149 --> 1:09:12.183
She wasn't crying, and she
wasn't messy.

1:09:12.185 --> 1:09:15.655
She was awake,

1:09:15.657 --> 1:09:17.355
and I knew.

1:09:17.357 --> 1:09:21.994
I knew that she wasn't mine
anymore, and I wasn't hers,

1:09:21.996 --> 1:09:23.361
and all that shit that made us

1:09:23.363 --> 1:09:26.034
what we were before was
just dead air between us.

1:09:28.069 --> 1:09:31.338
She looked at me like I was
somethin',

1:09:33.407 --> 1:09:35.677
somethin' more than what she
made me.

1:09:37.011 --> 1:09:38.178
She looked at me.

1:09:40.848 --> 1:09:42.016
And she saw me.

1:09:44.852 --> 1:09:49.857
And then she let me go.

1:09:51.191 --> 1:09:53.358
We're just gonna take a little
break,

1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.193
and we'll be right back, after
this.

1:09:56.196 --> 1:09:58.030
That crying is great, nice job.

1:10:02.036 --> 1:10:03.871
I'll be back in five.

1:10:16.084 --> 1:10:18.117
Well, it's over.

1:10:18.119 --> 1:10:19.552
They probably won't even air it,

1:10:19.554 --> 1:10:21.388
those disgusting people.

1:10:22.389 --> 1:10:24.424
I sold my soul for a Toyota
Camry.

1:10:28.129 --> 1:10:29.731
I think you should sit down.

1:10:31.099 --> 1:10:32.100
What?

1:11:36.964 --> 1:11:38.831
Miss you, buddy.

1:11:55.315 --> 1:11:56.818
You came back.

1:12:02.355 --> 1:12:06.225
I did.

1:12:18.172 --> 1:12:19.173
Oh, Doug.

1:12:47.235 --> 1:12:48.236
Hi.

1:12:49.203 --> 1:12:50.204
Hi.

1:12:51.239 --> 1:12:52.540
I guess you heard.

1:12:54.441 --> 1:12:55.442
I heard.

1:12:59.113 --> 1:13:01.914
I called and called.

1:13:01.916 --> 1:13:02.917
I know, Ma.

1:13:04.384 --> 1:13:05.385
It's okay.

1:13:11.726 --> 1:13:13.294
My room still got a bed in it?

1:13:16.130 --> 1:13:17.131
Sure.

1:13:22.069 --> 1:13:23.436
Let me help you with that.

1:13:25.405 --> 1:13:28.408
That is one fancy fuckin'
vehicle.

1:13:31.478 --> 1:13:32.947
- Right?
- Right.

1:13:35.917 --> 1:13:36.918
Okay.

1:13:38.418 --> 1:13:39.620
- Alright?
- Yeah.

1:13:41.255 --> 1:13:42.590
Okay, yeah.

1:13:46.627 --> 1:13:47.993
Come on.

1:13:47.995 --> 1:13:49.096
This thing is heavy.

1:13:59.607 --> 1:14:01.474
I know the wrong one of us died.

1:14:02.977 --> 1:14:04.444
Please know that I know that.

1:14:07.615 --> 1:14:09.449
You got any rye for this here
tea?

1:14:13.287 --> 1:14:15.455
I don't even know who
I'm hidin' this from.

1:14:21.629 --> 1:14:24.029
I kicked the smokes, though.

1:14:24.031 --> 1:14:25.166
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

1:14:28.302 --> 1:14:29.971
I told people you were dead.

1:14:31.471 --> 1:14:32.472
I know.

1:14:34.308 --> 1:14:36.310
To be fair, I basically am.

1:14:43.317 --> 1:14:45.152
I never even saw him get sick.

1:14:46.821 --> 1:14:50.490
You can never see what's
broken in a happy person.

1:14:57.832 --> 1:14:59.164
He died.

1:15:03.504 --> 1:15:07.041
I left, and he died.

1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:16.348
Cathy, what I said to
you before you left...

1:15:16.350 --> 1:15:17.349
It's okay.

1:15:17.351 --> 1:15:18.686
No, it isn't.

1:15:20.388 --> 1:15:24.525
Look, you're a part of me, you
know.

1:15:29.563 --> 1:15:31.432
When I talk about you,

1:15:33.367 --> 1:15:36.604
sometimes I'm just talkin' about
myself.

1:15:45.246 --> 1:15:47.713
Yeah, which one's
got the flowers on it?

1:15:47.715 --> 1:15:48.714
Here.

1:15:48.716 --> 1:15:49.715
Mm-hmm.

1:15:49.717 --> 1:15:50.718
Yes, very good.

1:15:52.386 --> 1:15:53.387
This one?

1:16:07.568 --> 1:16:08.569
Hey.

1:16:10.404 --> 1:16:11.737
What do you want?

1:16:11.739 --> 1:16:16.742
I just wanted to say that
I feel like shit about...

1:16:16.744 --> 1:16:17.745
You should.

1:16:21.148 --> 1:16:22.581
I don't need you to
apologize to me, Cathy.

1:16:22.583 --> 1:16:24.085
That's never what I needed.

1:16:27.788 --> 1:16:29.621
Yeah, baby, yes.

1:16:29.623 --> 1:16:30.624
Okay.

1:17:35.656 --> 1:17:36.857
Hi.

1:17:38.492 --> 1:17:39.858
Hey.

1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:41.160
I went to Scully's,

1:17:41.162 --> 1:17:43.328
thought I'd see if they
needed any barmaids.

1:17:43.330 --> 1:17:44.398
Why?

1:17:46.667 --> 1:17:48.501
'Cause I'm gonna stay.

1:17:48.503 --> 1:17:49.502
What?

1:17:49.504 --> 1:17:51.172
I'm not your fault.

1:17:52.006 --> 1:17:54.675
I know, but,

1:17:58.345 --> 1:17:59.680
I'm just no good out there.

1:18:00.681 --> 1:18:04.185
Don't let one sad thing
tell you who you are.

1:18:07.354 --> 1:18:08.355
Not just one.

1:18:10.191 --> 1:18:11.690
I made up my mind.

1:18:11.692 --> 1:18:15.427
I'm gonna go take a shower,
'cause I'm freezing.

1:18:15.429 --> 1:18:16.430
Cathy.

1:18:17.364 --> 1:18:18.365
Yeah, Ma.

1:18:21.536 --> 1:18:24.238
I always loved you more than I
could show.

1:18:29.710 --> 1:18:30.711
Yeah.

1:18:31.946 --> 1:18:33.380
Okay.

1:19:47.622 --> 1:19:48.787
Hmm?

1:19:48.789 --> 1:19:50.457
Ma?
