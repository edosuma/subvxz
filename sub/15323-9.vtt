WEBVTT

00:00.335 --> 00:02.345
WILL YOU JUST
LOOK AT THIS, PLEASE?

00:02.345 --> 00:04.786
IT'S T.J. KARSTEN'S IMPALA.
IT WAS PARKED AT THE GARAGE

00:04.786 --> 00:07.416
WHERE LIL' D WAS --
THE CASE IS CLOSED.
YOUR C.I. O.D.'d IN THE TUB.

00:07.416 --> 00:09.151
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:09.151 --> 00:11.153
I ASKED YOUR DAUGHTER
ON A DATE.

00:11.153 --> 00:12.421
YOU ASKED VAL ON A DATE?

00:12.421 --> 00:13.622
SHE LIKES GIRLS.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.757
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:14.757 --> 00:15.791
I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:17.526 --> 00:18.660
LET'S TRY AGAIN.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.262
IT'S NOT A CASUAL THING.

00:20.262 --> 00:22.531
I HAVE FEELINGS --
DON'T SAY ANY MORE.

00:22.531 --> 00:23.665
I GET IT.

00:23.665 --> 00:25.534
YOU EITHER WORK FOR ME
OR YOU DON'T,

00:25.534 --> 00:27.102
AND RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T.

00:27.102 --> 00:28.670
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU HERE, SON.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.305
WELCOME BACK TO WORK.

00:30.305 --> 00:32.641
I-I WAS THINKING

00:32.641 --> 00:34.643
I-I COULD HELP WITH
THE NEW STREETERVILLE PROPOSAL.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.479
WELL, THAT'S OKAY, SON.
I'VE ALREADY PUT SOMEONE ON IT.

00:37.479 --> 00:39.982
WELL, I COULD CHECK
THE BREAKDOWN.

00:39.982 --> 00:41.617
I'M GOOD WITH NUMBERS,
YOU KNOW.

00:41.617 --> 00:43.252
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE
ACCOUNTANTS FOR.

00:43.252 --> 00:45.587
I WANT TO HELP, DAD.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.756
I-I KNOW IT'S HARD
WITH JACK GONE.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.057
T.J., WE'RE FINE.

00:49.057 --> 00:51.460
EVERYTHING'S
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.

00:51.460 --> 00:53.962
POP?
WHAT?!

00:53.962 --> 00:56.698
JACK'S GONNA COME BACK
REAL SOON, ISN'T HE,

00:56.698 --> 00:58.700
WHEN HE GETS OVER
ALL THIS?

00:58.700 --> 01:00.969
T.J., I HAVE A MEETING
RIGHT NOW.

01:00.969 --> 01:03.172
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT
OVER LUNCH?

01:07.075 --> 01:09.077
<i> Jack McAllister.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:10.412 --> 01:15.083
JACK, I KEEP GETTING
YOUR DAMN VOICEMAIL.

01:16.585 --> 01:20.255
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D CALL ME BACK.

01:23.158 --> 01:25.327
I MISS YOU, SON.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.385
REMEMBER TO BRING
YOUR CLEATS TO SCHOOL.

01:50.385 --> 01:52.054
YOU'VE GOT PRACTICE TODAY.

01:52.054 --> 01:54.490
I'M GONNA PLAY GOALIE,
BLOCK A GOAL WITH MY HEAD.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.158
WELL, MAKE SURE IT'S YOUR HEAD
AND NOT YOUR FACE.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.127
BREAKFAST TIME!
DAD!

01:59.127 --> 02:00.596
SOMEBODY ORDER
HAM AND PINEAPPLE?

02:00.596 --> 02:03.098
OH, AWESOME!

02:03.098 --> 02:06.034
FOR BREAKFAST? REALLY?
IT'S OUR NEW THING.

02:06.034 --> 02:10.706
OLLIE AND I FOUND
A 24-HOUR PLACE DOWN THE STREET.

02:10.706 --> 02:13.775
WE ALSO WATCH CLASSIC SPORTS
WHILE WE EAT IT.

02:13.775 --> 02:17.045
OKAY, WELL, OLIVER'S GOT
A BIRTHDAY PARTY ON SATURDAY.

02:17.045 --> 02:18.480
INVITE'S ON THE FRIDGE.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.315
YOU'LL NEED TO GET A PRESENT.
GOT IT.

02:20.315 --> 02:23.986
LAUNDRY'S DONE.
I CHANGED THE LINENS ON THE BED.

02:26.154 --> 02:27.689
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

02:29.424 --> 02:32.094
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

02:32.094 --> 02:34.229
OPEN IT LATER.

02:38.934 --> 02:42.271
OKAY. BYE, LOVEBUG.

02:42.271 --> 02:43.605
I'LL SEE YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.

02:43.605 --> 02:45.107
BYE, MOMMY.

02:45.107 --> 02:46.942
DAD, THE BLACKHAWKS
JUST SCORED!

02:46.942 --> 02:48.944
WHAT?!
AH, MISSED IT.

02:48.944 --> 02:51.780
LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN.

03:19.107 --> 03:22.110
-- Captions by VITAC --

03:37.826 --> 03:39.161
HELLO?

03:39.161 --> 03:43.398
MR. McALLISTER, THIS IS
QUINCY THERINGER FROM THE FBI.

03:43.398 --> 03:44.900
You've been ducking
my calls.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.469
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
Your help. That's all.

03:47.469 --> 03:50.038
WE'RE CIRCLING THE WAGONS
AROUND THE KARSTEN FAMILY.

03:50.038 --> 03:53.041
WELL, ACTUALLY, UH, MY SITUATION
HAS CHANGED, SO --

03:53.041 --> 03:55.143
You quit Karsten Allied.
We know.

03:55.143 --> 03:57.779
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY YOU
AND I NEED TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN

03:57.779 --> 03:58.880
BEFORE THIS GETS MESSY.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.716
LISTEN --
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

04:00.716 --> 04:02.751
WE'RE NOT TARGETING YOU, JACK.
NOT YET.

04:02.751 --> 04:04.753
Don't make us come
after you, okay?

04:11.526 --> 04:13.362
HEY.

04:13.362 --> 04:14.896
HEY.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.565
WHERE ARE THE BOWLS?

04:16.565 --> 04:17.899
IN THE KITCHEN.

04:17.899 --> 04:21.169
OH.

04:21.169 --> 04:23.171
I DID NOT SEE THEM.

04:23.171 --> 04:25.173
I'M MAKING EGGS.
YOU LIKE EGGS, RIGHT?

04:25.173 --> 04:27.175
SURE.
WELL, GO AHEAD AND REST.

04:27.175 --> 04:28.844
I'LL -- I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE READY.

04:28.844 --> 04:30.345
NO, NO. I'LL HELP YOU.

04:30.345 --> 04:33.515
OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR
BECAUSE YOU'RE A PRO,

04:33.515 --> 04:34.916
AND I'M A RANK AMATEUR.

04:34.916 --> 04:39.254
WELL, AT COOKING, MAYBE,
BUT NOT AT EVERYTHING.

04:41.089 --> 04:43.925
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING...

04:43.925 --> 04:45.961
WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY BEEN
ON A REAL DATE.

04:45.961 --> 04:48.363
WHAT DO YOU SAY, TONIGHT?

04:48.363 --> 04:51.867
OR ARE YOU ASHAMED OF
BEING SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH ME?

04:51.867 --> 04:52.968
MM, YEAH.

04:52.968 --> 04:55.203
WELL, YOU COULD WEAR A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD.

04:55.203 --> 04:56.872
YEAH.
YEAH, I'LL DO THAT.

04:56.872 --> 04:57.873
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

04:59.441 --> 05:00.776
BRUNCH IN 10 MINUTES.

05:00.776 --> 05:01.877
OKAY.
OKAY.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.027
HEY.
HEY.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.531
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.366
MM.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.835
I GOT THEM TODAY.
GOT WHAT?

05:26.835 --> 05:30.505
IT'S A SHOCK SEEING IT
IN WRITING.

05:30.505 --> 05:33.775
I CAN IMAGINE.

05:33.775 --> 05:35.610
HEY.

05:37.946 --> 05:40.949
LET'S TAKE OFF, GET OUT OF TOWN,
AND CLEAR OUR HEADS.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.651
AND GO WHERE?

05:42.651 --> 05:45.821
ANYWHERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
MY CAR IS OUT FRONT.

05:45.821 --> 05:48.323
LET'S JUST GO
AND DO SOMETHING SPONTANEOUS,

05:48.323 --> 05:50.325
HAVE AN ADVENTURE.

05:50.325 --> 05:53.662
JACK, I CAN'T.
YOU CAN, AND YOU NEED TO.

05:53.662 --> 05:54.896
COME ON.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.732
YOU HAVE THREE DAYS BEFORE
YOU'RE BACK ON OLIVER TIME.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.200
CALL THE MAGAZINE,

05:58.200 --> 06:02.604
MOVE MEETINGS, POSTPONE
ASSIGNMENTS, WHATEVER IT TAKES.

06:02.604 --> 06:05.107
LET'S JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING
BEHIND.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.675
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

06:06.675 --> 06:10.212
I'LL GO
GET MY TOOTHBRUSH.

06:10.212 --> 06:12.881
MM!

06:22.424 --> 06:23.692
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

06:23.692 --> 06:25.360
OKAY.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.363
I MAY NOT HAVE SAID
THIS BEFORE,

06:28.363 --> 06:30.599
BUT I'M -- I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU'RE BACK.

06:32.667 --> 06:36.338
I THINK I KNOW WHY JACK
CAN'T GIVE UP THIS GIRL.

06:36.338 --> 06:38.140
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

06:38.140 --> 06:41.476
LIKE ME AND BRANDY.

06:41.476 --> 06:43.078
OKAY.

06:43.078 --> 06:46.414
DON'T FORGET TO TAKE
YOUR MEDICATION.

06:47.849 --> 06:51.353
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS
TO YOU WHEN YOU DIE?

06:51.353 --> 06:55.157
DO YOU GO SOMEWHERE,
O-OR DO YOU JUST DISAPPEAR?

06:55.157 --> 06:58.360
EVERYBODY'S GOT
THEIR OWN OPINION ABOUT THAT.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.594
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IN?

06:59.594 --> 07:04.266
I BELIEVE IN...NOTHING.

07:04.266 --> 07:06.034
AFTER YOU DIE,
THEY CREMATE YOU,

07:06.034 --> 07:08.170
OR THEY PUT YOU IN A HOLE
IN THE GROUND,

07:08.170 --> 07:10.238
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

07:10.238 --> 07:13.708
NO SOUL, NO AFTERLIFE,
NO REINCARNATION.

07:13.708 --> 07:17.579
SO BRANDY'S
JUST NOWHERE NOW? AND MOM?

07:17.579 --> 07:20.415
T-THEY'RE NOT IN PAIN.
THEY'RE NOT SUFFERING.

07:20.415 --> 07:24.352
THEY'RE JUST...GONE.

07:24.352 --> 07:28.690
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:28.690 --> 07:31.193
I THINK BRANDY'S
IN A BETTER PLACE.

07:31.193 --> 07:33.695
MOM, TOO.

07:33.695 --> 07:35.530
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE.

07:37.132 --> 07:40.468
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:40.468 --> 07:43.305
DON'T FORGET YOUR MEDS.

08:48.167 --> 08:50.827
YEAH, MY FAMILY USED TO TAKE
A LOT OF ROAD TRIPS.

08:50.827 --> 08:53.663
I'D SQUEEZE BETWEEN MY PARENTS
IN THE FRONT OF MY DAD'S PICKUP.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.498
AND WHENEVER WE CROSSED
A STATE LINE,

08:55.498 --> 08:57.834
I'D MAKE A WISH
AND HE'D LET ME HONK THE HORN.

08:57.834 --> 09:01.170
BUT I THOUGHT THAT IF I HONKED
THE HORN AT THE EXACT MOMENT

09:01.170 --> 09:03.206
WHEN THE FRONT WHEEL
WAS IN ONE STATE

09:03.206 --> 09:05.108
AND THE BACK WHEEL
WAS IN ANOTHER,

09:05.108 --> 09:06.442
THE WISH WOULD COME TRUE.

09:08.077 --> 09:10.746
YOU DON'T TALK
ABOUT YOUR PARENTS MUCH.

09:10.746 --> 09:14.250
WELL, THEY'VE BEEN DEAD
A LONG TIME.

09:19.255 --> 09:23.759
AND WHEN THE KARSTEN FAMILY
ADOPTED YOU,

09:23.759 --> 09:26.729
DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY KIND
OF HELP, SOMEONE TO TALK TO?

09:26.729 --> 09:30.299
NO.

09:32.401 --> 09:35.071
WHY DID THEY DO IT,
ADOPT YOU?

09:35.071 --> 09:38.074
WELL, DAD WAS
A CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN

09:38.074 --> 09:41.077
AT KARSTEN ALLIED
FOR 17 YEARS.

09:41.077 --> 09:43.513
THATCHER CAME TO TRUST HIM,
RELY ON HIM.

09:45.848 --> 09:48.684
I THINK MAYBE HE FELT

09:48.684 --> 09:52.889
THAT HE OWED IT TO MY FATHER
TO TAKE ME IN.

09:54.557 --> 09:55.725
LOOK.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.894
MAKE A WISH.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.739
SHE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER
FOR<i> WICKER PARK MAGAZINE.</i>

10:09.739 --> 10:13.042
OH, LOOK. HER PHOTO ESSAY
ON CHICAGO'S BEST BURGER,

10:13.042 --> 10:14.710
REALLY
CUTTING-EDGE STUFF.

10:14.710 --> 10:17.380
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST
IN BONDING WITH MY DOG, DO YOU?

10:17.380 --> 10:19.215
MUSHROOM HUNTERS.
FASCINATING.

10:19.215 --> 10:21.217
IF YOU AND I ARE GONNA GET
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS, YOU GOT TO

10:21.217 --> 10:23.252
GET SERIOUS ABOUT GEORGE, OKAY?
HE'S PART OF THE DEAL.

10:23.252 --> 10:26.722
CABBAGE ROSES
AND BABY STROLLERS.

10:26.722 --> 10:28.824
OH, MY GOD.

10:28.824 --> 10:30.293
MY GRANDFATHER.

10:30.293 --> 10:31.627
OOH! THE PLOT THICKENS.

10:31.627 --> 10:33.462
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S HOW SHE MET YOUR DAD?

10:33.462 --> 10:36.465
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T CARE.

10:38.801 --> 10:40.803
I LEFT MY KEYS AT YOUR HOUSE.
I GOT TO RUN BACK.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.805
CAN YOU PLEASE STAY
AND TRY TO BOND WITH MY DOG?

10:42.805 --> 10:46.609
HEY, STRANGER.
BEEN A WHILE.

10:46.609 --> 10:48.344
I'M NOT USED TO SEEING YOU
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.

10:48.344 --> 10:49.845
DELPHINE, VAL.
VAL, DELPHINE.

10:49.845 --> 10:50.880
HEY.
HI.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.549
HI, GEORGE! HOW YOU DOING?!
I MISSED YOU!

10:53.549 --> 10:55.518
DEL, I GOT TO RUN.
TAKE CARE, OKAY?

10:55.518 --> 10:57.353
YEAH, YEAH.

10:57.353 --> 10:58.955
YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER?

10:58.955 --> 11:00.122
YEAH.

11:00.122 --> 11:02.625
WATCH OUT.
SHE'S A WILD RIDE.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.161
AS SOON AS SHE'S GOT YOU,
SHE'S BORED.

11:05.161 --> 11:07.697
BROKE A LOT OF HEARTS
IN MY CROWD.

11:07.697 --> 11:09.999
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
THIS?

11:09.999 --> 11:12.168
SORRY.
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

11:12.168 --> 11:15.538
SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING.
NICE MEETING YOU.

11:17.707 --> 11:18.708
BRING.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.821
DO YOU GUYS NEED ANY HELP?
YES!

11:31.821 --> 11:34.323
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BROKEN FUEL LINE.

11:34.323 --> 11:36.659
GREAT --
I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE

11:36.659 --> 11:38.694
HAD THE CAR CHECKED OUT
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

11:38.694 --> 11:39.862
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

11:39.862 --> 11:41.364
NO.
NO, NOT US.

11:41.364 --> 11:43.399
UH, MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE,
HELEN,

11:43.399 --> 11:45.134
IS MARRYING
TOM'S CLIMBING PARTNER.

11:45.134 --> 11:47.136
WE INTRODUCED THEM,
AND I'M IN THE CEREMONY.

11:47.136 --> 11:49.805
TOM'S GIVING A TOAST.
AND IF WE MISS IT...

11:49.805 --> 11:52.375
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.343
WHERE'S THE WEDDING?
ABOUT 90 MILES AWAY.

11:54.343 --> 11:57.413
THEY RENTED SOME OLD HOUSE IN
THE MIDDLE OF FRIGGING NOWHERE.

12:00.149 --> 12:02.918
WE'LL TAKE YOU.
NO. WE COULDN'T
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

12:02.918 --> 12:04.820
NO, SERIOUSLY.
WE HAVE NOWHERE TO BE.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.657
OH, MY GOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

12:07.657 --> 12:10.760
SEE? KARMA AT WORK.
THANK YOU.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.168
HELLO.

12:20.903 --> 12:22.571
HI.

12:22.571 --> 12:24.373
I'M JULES.
AIDAN.

12:24.373 --> 12:25.708
I WAS JUST CLEANING UP.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.544
OKAY.
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.

12:28.544 --> 12:30.279
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR MY KEYS.

12:30.279 --> 12:31.747
OH, YOU'RE VAL'S FRIEND,
RIGHT?

12:31.747 --> 12:32.948
YOU GOT IT.

12:32.948 --> 12:36.352
YOU WORK AT KARSTEN ALLIED?
UH, YES.

12:36.352 --> 12:39.355
WHAT DO YOU DO THERE?

12:39.355 --> 12:41.357
I.T.

12:41.357 --> 12:43.025
I'M A PISCES,
I GREW UP IN TAMPA,

12:43.025 --> 12:44.760
AND I LIKE LONG WALKS
IN THE PARK.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.463
SORRY.
I DON'T MEAN TO BE NOSY.

12:47.463 --> 12:49.298
SO, WHO ARE YOU?

12:49.298 --> 12:51.600
I AM A FRIEND OF ELAINE'S.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.270
FRIEND, HUH? GOT IT.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.205
OH.

12:56.205 --> 12:59.275
HERE THEY ARE.
I GOT TO GET GOING.

12:59.275 --> 13:00.609
NICE MEETING YOU.

13:00.609 --> 13:03.279
YEAH.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.920
YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS,
WE'RE BOTH DOWN ON THIS WEDDING.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.922
WHY?
EH, THEY'RE 22.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.224
YOU KNOW,
WHO GETS MARRIED AT 22?
I DID.

13:15.224 --> 13:17.727
I WAS 23.
IT WAS DIFFERENT BACK THEN.

13:17.727 --> 13:19.562
HEY. EASY, NOW.

13:19.562 --> 13:20.696
WE'RE GENETICALLY
PROGRAMMED

13:20.696 --> 13:23.032
FOR RELATIONSHIPS
TO LAST 3 TO 5 YEARS.

13:23.032 --> 13:25.534
HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO
BEEN TOGETHER?

13:25.534 --> 13:26.602
3 1/2 YEARS.

13:26.602 --> 13:27.937
SO OUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED,
REALLY.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.772
STOP, TOM.

13:29.772 --> 13:32.808
THE LONG-TERM THING IS
CLEARLY WORKING FOR THESE TWO.

13:32.808 --> 13:34.076
EH,
WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT.

13:34.076 --> 13:36.312
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW

13:36.312 --> 13:37.980
THAT THE PERSON
YOU WANT TO BE WITH NOW

13:37.980 --> 13:40.583
IS THE PERSON YOU'RE GOING TO
WANT TO BE WITH IN 20 YEARS?

13:40.583 --> 13:43.152
I GUESS,
ULTIMATELY YOU DON'T.

13:43.152 --> 13:44.587
YOU DON'T?

13:44.587 --> 13:46.822
NO.
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH.

13:46.822 --> 13:49.825
WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT FAITH.
IT'S ABOUT OUR DNA.

13:49.825 --> 13:52.661
I MEAN, WHEN YOU START OUT,
THERE'S THIS SURGE OF MAGIC.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.330
BUT ALL THAT'S JUST
AN EVOLUTIONARY TRICK

13:54.330 --> 13:56.298
TO MAKE PEOPLE HAVE BABIES.

13:56.298 --> 13:58.167
I REALLY HOPE THIS
ISN'T YOUR WEDDING TOAST.

13:59.769 --> 14:02.938
WE NEED CITY HALL TO --
I DON'T CARE ABOUT EXCUSES,
BYRON.

14:02.938 --> 14:03.939
WE NEED TO BREAK GROUND.

14:03.939 --> 14:05.274
MR. KARSTEN,
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS --

14:05.274 --> 14:07.176
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU'D BE IN HERE.

14:07.176 --> 14:09.345
T.J., THIS IS
A MEETING ABOUT STREETERVILLE.

14:09.345 --> 14:10.379
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

14:10.379 --> 14:13.048
IT SMELLS LIKE FISH
IN HERE.

14:13.048 --> 14:16.452
LAURA, WOULD YOU MIND?

14:16.452 --> 14:19.722
I'M NOT UNDER THE HOOD.

14:19.722 --> 14:21.690
NOW,
ABOUT THOSE PERMITS.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.526
I WILL HEAD DOWN TO --

14:30.399 --> 14:32.067
SOMEONE CALL 911!

14:32.067 --> 14:34.136
NO. GET GROVES.
HE'S IN THE SYSTEM.

14:34.136 --> 14:36.539
BUT MR. KARSTEN,
HE NEEDS AN AMBULANCE!

14:36.539 --> 14:38.040
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
IT'S A SEIZURE.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.609
JUST CALL GROVES NOW!

14:46.454 --> 14:49.686
I'D LIKE TO BRING HIM IN
FOR SOME TESTS.
WHY?

14:49.686 --> 14:52.522
SO YOU CAN TELL ME
SOMETHING I ALREADY KNOW?

14:52.522 --> 14:54.991
YOU USED TO TREAT
HIS SEIZURES AT HOME.

14:54.991 --> 14:57.327
BUT HE HASN'T HAD ONE
IN ALMOST TWO YEARS.

14:57.327 --> 14:58.361
WHY NOW?

14:58.361 --> 15:00.697
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
HE WENT OFF HIS MEDS.

15:00.697 --> 15:03.533
I'D LIKE TO CHECK
HIS DRUG LEVELS, RUN AN E.E.G.,

15:03.533 --> 15:05.835
PROPERLY ASSESS
THE SITUATION.

15:05.835 --> 15:07.504
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?
HE'S POSTICTAL.

15:07.504 --> 15:10.406
I WON'T BE ABLE TO EVALUATE HIS
NEUROLOGICAL STATUS FOR HOURS.

15:10.406 --> 15:12.375
WELL, THEN MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE.

15:13.643 --> 15:16.479
WOW!
NOTHING LIKE MY WEDDING.

15:16.479 --> 15:17.914
LET ME GUESS.

15:17.914 --> 15:19.349
FORMAL HOTEL-BALLROOM
SORT OF THING?

15:19.349 --> 15:21.851
300 GUESTS.

15:21.851 --> 15:23.553
HEY. SO, I TALKED TO OUR
FRIENDS, AND IT'S SETTLED.

15:23.553 --> 15:24.888
YOU'RE STAYING
FOR THE WEDDING.

15:24.888 --> 15:26.189
OH, NO, WE COULDN'T.

15:26.189 --> 15:28.691
YOU HAVE TO.
YOU'RE THE HEROES OF THE NIGHT.

15:28.691 --> 15:30.360
IT'S GONNA START
ANY MINUTE.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.695
WELL,
IT IS PRETTY HERE.

15:32.695 --> 15:33.830
EXCELLENT.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.331
OH, AND ALSO, THERE'S THIS.

15:35.331 --> 15:37.567
EVERYONE HAD ONE
AT COCKTAIL HOUR.

15:37.567 --> 15:41.004
IT MAKES EVERYTHING...
WAY MORE FUN.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.943
MIGHT AS WELL GO WITH IT.

16:00.723 --> 16:02.725
TAKE.

16:02.725 --> 16:04.594
T-A-K-E.

16:04.594 --> 16:07.263
DRIVE.

16:07.263 --> 16:10.767
D-R-I-V.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.069
NOPE, TOLD YOU BEFORE,
GOT TO ADD AN "E" AT THE END.

16:13.069 --> 16:14.804
WELL, HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER?

16:14.804 --> 16:16.272
YOU JUST HAVE TO
MEMORIZE IT.

16:16.272 --> 16:18.107
WELL,
THAT'S NOT WHAT MOM DOES.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.276
SHE DRAWS A PICTURE.

16:20.276 --> 16:22.278
A PICTURE OF WHAT?

16:22.278 --> 16:24.280
LIKE FOR "DRIVE,"
SHE WOULD DRAW A CAR

16:24.280 --> 16:27.750
WITH AN "E" ON THE SIDE
SO I DON'T FORGET THE "E."

16:27.750 --> 16:30.787
WELL, I'M NOT MUCH
OF AN ARTIST.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.121
THEN HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER?

16:32.121 --> 16:33.957
YOU JUST HAVE TO WRITE IT DOWN
A BUNCH OF TIMES.

16:33.957 --> 16:35.458
I DON'T WANT TO.
OLIVER.

16:35.458 --> 16:38.294
I DON'T CARE
IF I GET IT WRONG.

16:38.294 --> 16:40.129
YES, YOU DO.

16:42.999 --> 16:46.336
I KNOW THINGS ARE HARD
SOMETIMES,

16:46.336 --> 16:50.840
AND YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GONNA
GET EVERYTHING RIGHT IN LIFE.

16:50.840 --> 16:57.614
BUT IT IS REALLY, REALLY
IMPORTANT TO NEVER GIVE UP,

16:57.614 --> 16:59.782
TO NEVER STOP TRYING.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.622
HOW'S THAT?

17:05.622 --> 17:07.190
WEIRD.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.492
IS THAT EVEN A CAR?

17:09.492 --> 17:12.695
YEAH. IT'S AN IMPALA.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.299
HMM.

17:16.299 --> 17:18.468
OH, THIS WAS FUN.

17:18.468 --> 17:21.471
"WAS"?
WELL, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

17:21.471 --> 17:23.673
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO OVER.
OH!

17:23.673 --> 17:25.675
OH, WELL, I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN
ON A REAL DATE

17:25.675 --> 17:27.176
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.178
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA
GET USED TO IT.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.849
HEY. CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

17:32.849 --> 17:35.618
WHY ARE YOU STILL WEARING
YOUR WEDDING RING?

17:35.618 --> 17:38.454
UM...

17:38.454 --> 17:40.790
I DON'T KNOW. I...

17:40.790 --> 17:43.459
I MEAN, I'VE HAD IT ON
FOR SO LONG, IT'S --

17:43.459 --> 17:46.029
IT'S LIKE A PART
OF MY HAND NOW.

17:46.029 --> 17:48.831
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

17:48.831 --> 17:50.500
OH, YOU DON'T?

17:50.500 --> 17:53.002
WELL, BY ALL MEANS,
EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

17:53.002 --> 17:56.839
OKAY,
I THINK THAT YOU ARE SINGLE

17:56.839 --> 17:59.709
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 20 YEARS,
AND IT SCARES YOU.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.045
YEAH.

18:02.045 --> 18:05.081
YEAH, WELL,
IT DEFINITELY DOES.

18:05.081 --> 18:09.852
WELL, I HOPE IT'S NOT ME
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF.

18:09.852 --> 18:11.854
SHOULD I BE?

18:11.854 --> 18:16.259
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

18:16.259 --> 18:19.329
GOOD.

18:22.765 --> 18:24.267
LOOK, ELAINE,
THERE'S SOMETHING I --

18:24.267 --> 18:25.535
OH, WAIT! WAIT!

18:25.535 --> 18:27.370
AHH!

18:27.370 --> 18:28.371
OH!

18:28.371 --> 18:31.541
QUICK, MAKE A WISH.
OKAY.

18:31.541 --> 18:34.777
GOOD?
MM-HMM.

18:37.513 --> 18:39.382
SO,
WHAT DID YOU WISH FOR?

18:39.382 --> 18:45.321
I...WISHED THAT LIFE
WAS LESS COMPLICATED.

19:00.069 --> 19:03.406
TEA AND COFFEE
ARE ON THE PORCH!

19:04.974 --> 19:06.976
I DON'T KNOW
ANY THESE PEOPLE,

19:06.976 --> 19:10.980
BUT I THINK I LOVE THEM,
ALL OF THEM.

19:13.616 --> 19:16.786
DO YOU KNOW YOUR EYES ARE BLUE,
BUT THEY'RE ALSO GREEN

19:16.786 --> 19:21.391
AND THEN THERE'S THIS RIM
THAT'S KIND OF ORANGE?

19:21.391 --> 19:23.559
I WAS HANDED
DIVORCE PAPERS TODAY.

19:23.559 --> 19:27.730
I SHOULD BE HERE THINKING
ALL LOVE IS DOOMED.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.400
BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT COUPLE --
THAT COUPLE BELIEVES,

19:30.400 --> 19:33.436
AND THAT IS
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

19:33.436 --> 19:36.105
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE
ALL LOVE IS DOOMED.

19:36.105 --> 19:37.407
THAT'S GOOD.

19:39.575 --> 19:40.743
BUT WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT?

19:40.743 --> 19:45.081
WHAT IF IT IS ALL
JUST AN EVOLUTIONARY TRICK?

19:45.081 --> 19:49.419
I BELIEVE THAT
WE ARE MORE THAN OUR DNA.

19:49.419 --> 19:52.755
BUT ALL WE CAN
EVER HOPE FOR

19:52.755 --> 19:56.325
IS THAT WE ARE WHERE
WE'RE MEANT TO BE,

19:56.325 --> 20:01.197
WHICH I'M CERTAIN OF
RIGHT NOW.

20:37.733 --> 20:39.569
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:39.569 --> 20:42.004
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING OVER.

20:42.004 --> 20:45.174
OKAY.
IS THIS ABOUT THE DOG?

20:45.174 --> 20:47.643
BECAUSE SERIOUSLY,
I CAN STOP PUSHING IT.

20:47.643 --> 20:50.346
DID YOU USED TO DATE THAT GIRL
THAT WE MET AT THE PARK TODAY?

20:50.346 --> 20:53.850
BABE, JEALOUSY?
SERIOUSLY?

20:53.850 --> 20:56.018
IT'S A HORRIBLE,
DESTRUCTIVE EMOTION,

20:56.018 --> 20:57.520
AND IT'S A TOTAL TURNOFF.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.523
I'M INTO THIS. OKAY?

21:00.523 --> 21:02.191
I PROMISE TO BE
STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH YOU,

21:02.191 --> 21:03.526
AND I PROMISE NOT TO LIE.

21:03.526 --> 21:06.529
YOU CAN'T PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T BREAK MY HEART.

21:06.529 --> 21:09.031
NO ONE
CAN PROMISE THAT.

21:09.031 --> 21:12.201
I'M JUST -- I'M GETTING
THIS REALLY STRONG FEELING

21:12.201 --> 21:15.872
THAT I NEED TO GET OUT
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

21:15.872 --> 21:17.540
NOW WHO'S
BEING THE DRAMA QUEEN?

21:17.540 --> 21:19.375
OKAY,
CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.877
BUT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT LATELY,

21:20.877 --> 21:23.045
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
I'M UP FOR THE INEVITABLE DAY

21:23.045 --> 21:24.714
WHEN
YOU MEET SOMEONE ELSE

21:24.714 --> 21:27.550
OR I GO OFF TO COLLEGE OR THIS
THING JUST RUNS ITS COURSE.

21:27.550 --> 21:32.054
SO, WE'RE BREAKING UP NOW
TO AVOID BREAKING UP LATER?

21:32.054 --> 21:34.891
THIS SCARES ME.

21:34.891 --> 21:38.060
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

21:47.470 --> 21:50.473
I'LL GO GET YOUR JACKET
FROM THE CAR.
OKAY.

21:50.473 --> 21:53.643
I'M GONNA GO AND GET
A MASSIVE SLICE OF CAKE.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.395
HEY, JACK.

22:12.395 --> 22:13.629
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

22:13.629 --> 22:17.099
QUINCY THERINGER, FBI.

22:18.768 --> 22:21.604
GOT IT. THANKS.

22:21.604 --> 22:25.274
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

22:26.776 --> 22:28.277
HIS TOPIRAMATE LEVEL
WAS SKY-HIGH,

22:28.277 --> 22:30.446
BUT THE OTHER MEDS
WERE UNDETECTABLE.

22:30.446 --> 22:34.784
HE PROBABLY MIXED UP
HIS MEDICATION BY MISTAKE.

22:34.784 --> 22:36.686
I'LL HAVE A TALK
WITH HIM.

22:36.686 --> 22:39.355
MIGHT REQUIRE
MORE THAN A TALK.

22:42.692 --> 22:44.694
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
INTENTIONAL.

22:47.530 --> 22:51.200
IT'S BEEN 22 YEARS,
CASEY.

22:51.200 --> 22:55.538
YOU PROMISED ME
IT WOULDN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.

22:55.538 --> 22:57.540
SEIZURE DISORDERS
CAN BE HARD TO MANAGE.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.475
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT HIS SEIZURES.

22:59.475 --> 23:02.311
I'M TALKING
ABOUT HIS MIND.

23:02.311 --> 23:04.146
YOU SAID
THERE'D BE ADVANCES --

23:04.146 --> 23:07.883
STEM-CELL THERAPY,
NEURONAL REGENERATION.

23:07.883 --> 23:09.952
I SAID I HAD HOPE
FOR THOSE THINGS.

23:09.952 --> 23:13.623
YEAH. SO DID I.

23:13.623 --> 23:16.459
I CLUNG TO THAT HOPE.

23:16.459 --> 23:20.796
HE'S NEVER
GETTING BETTER.

23:20.796 --> 23:22.298
IS HE?

23:24.634 --> 23:25.801
I HAD YOUR CAR TRACKED.

23:25.801 --> 23:28.137
WE HAVE A FANCY SETUP
BACK AT MY OFFICE.

23:28.137 --> 23:30.473
I DIDN'T LIKE SEEING
THAT JACK McALLISTER BLIP

23:30.473 --> 23:31.807
HEADED
ACROSS STATE LINES.

23:31.807 --> 23:33.643
LOOK -- IT'S ONLY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

23:33.643 --> 23:36.479
YEAH, A LITTLE IDYLL IN THE
WOODS, WHILE ROME IS BURNING.

23:36.479 --> 23:39.382
HUH?
GOOD THING IS,
THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO CHAT.

23:39.382 --> 23:42.184
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET HOME.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

23:42.184 --> 23:43.719
WE'VE GOT
AN ALDERMAN CLAIMING

23:43.719 --> 23:46.088
KARSTEN WAS RUNNING
A REAL-ESTATE-CORRUPTION SCHEME

23:46.088 --> 23:48.924
INVOLVING BRIBERY, EXTORTION,
AND A NAIL GUN,

23:48.924 --> 23:51.494
A WAREHOUSE WORKER
WILLING TO TESTIFY

23:51.494 --> 23:53.396
THAT YOU SMUGGLED
ILLEGAL SHIPMENTS FROM CHINA.

23:53.396 --> 23:56.065
SO TALK TO ME NOW.

23:56.065 --> 23:58.701
THIS WHOLE THING IS
AT A BREAKING POINT.

24:03.362 --> 24:04.830
I'LL GO DOWN THE ROAD
A FEW MILES.

24:04.830 --> 24:08.008
I SHOULDN'T BE LONG.
DO YOU WANT ME
TO COME RUNNING WITH YOU?

24:08.008 --> 24:09.309
NO, YOU STAY HERE.

24:09.309 --> 24:11.177
I'LL BE BACK SOON.
OKAY.

24:11.177 --> 24:13.513
MISS HANLEY.

24:13.513 --> 24:15.115
OH, "SARA," PLEASE.

24:15.115 --> 24:17.284
EVER SEEN
A RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD?

24:17.284 --> 24:20.587
NO. BUT I HAVE A FEELING
I'M ABOUT TO.

24:26.226 --> 24:29.229
HEY, YOU.
HI, MOM.

24:29.229 --> 24:30.897
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS,

24:30.897 --> 24:33.667
THAT CAMPING TRIP WE TOOK?

24:33.667 --> 24:35.669
YEAH, VIC GOT BIT
BY A SNAKE.

24:38.838 --> 24:42.575
I BROKE UP WITH JULES.

24:42.575 --> 24:44.644
WHY?

24:44.644 --> 24:48.148
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
WE GET ALONG REALLY WELL.

24:48.148 --> 24:51.151
BUT SHE'S OLDER,
MORE EXPERIENCED.

24:51.151 --> 24:54.487
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I TRUST IT.

24:54.487 --> 24:57.190
HOW DO I KNOW SHE'S NOT
GONNA BREAK MY HEART?

24:57.190 --> 25:01.027
YOU DON'T.
BUT YOU NEVER DO.

25:03.029 --> 25:08.001
LISTEN, WHATEVER'S, UH,
GOING ON WITH ME AND YOUR DAD,

25:08.001 --> 25:10.003
I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVER,

25:10.003 --> 25:13.840
EVER THINK THAT
IT'S ALL NOT WORTH IT.

25:15.375 --> 25:18.044
BECAUSE IT IS WORTH IT.

25:18.044 --> 25:21.047
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:37.964 --> 25:41.067
OH, LOOK.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.403
IT'S TABITHA.

25:43.403 --> 25:44.971
WOW, WHAT IS SHE?

25:44.971 --> 25:47.640
SHE'S A PEREGRINE.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.810
SHE'S LOOKING FOR ALONZO.
HE MUST BE NEARBY.

25:50.810 --> 25:54.481
ALONZO?
HER PARTNER.

25:54.481 --> 25:56.883
THESE FALCONS
MATE FOR LIFE.

25:59.319 --> 26:00.653
I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

26:00.653 --> 26:01.988
I'LL GET
TO THE POINT THEN.

26:01.988 --> 26:04.090
YOU NEED TO GET OVER
YOUR LOYALTY TO KARSTEN.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.159
YOU NEED TO START HELPING US.
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

26:06.159 --> 26:08.828
JACK, DO YOU UNDERSTAND --
LOOK, THEY'RE FAMILY, OKAY?

26:08.828 --> 26:10.597
WITHOUT THEM,
I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'D BE.

26:10.597 --> 26:12.098
I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T BE --

26:12.098 --> 26:14.601
ON EVERY PAGE OF A FEDERAL PROBE
IMPLICATING YOU

26:14.601 --> 26:17.637
IN A LIST OF CRIMES AND
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES A MILE LONG.

26:17.637 --> 26:20.940
I'M NOT GONNA TURN ON HIM.
THEN YOU'RE GONNA SINK
WITH HIM.

26:20.940 --> 26:23.109
'CAUSE WE'RE COMING HARD,
AND WHEN WE DO,

26:23.109 --> 26:25.345
YOU CAN EITHER BE
WITH KARSTEN OR WITH US.

26:25.345 --> 26:27.514
ARE YOU READY
TO GO TO PRISON FOR HIM?

26:37.657 --> 26:41.161
YOU KNOW
WHERE TO FIND ME.

26:41.161 --> 26:43.630
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU.

26:58.378 --> 27:01.214
DID YOU SEE SOMETHING?

27:01.214 --> 27:03.716
UM...NO.

27:03.716 --> 27:06.719
FOR A SECOND,
I THOUGHT I DID.

27:14.627 --> 27:16.463
SO, YOUR BUDDY FOUND THAT GUN,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE?

27:16.463 --> 27:18.465
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

27:18.465 --> 27:19.632
QUITE A COINCIDENCE,

27:19.632 --> 27:22.135
YOU HAVING T.J.'s IMPALA
PARKED IN YOUR GARAGE,

27:22.135 --> 27:24.204
AND LIL' D HAPPENS
TO GET KILLED

27:24.204 --> 27:27.740
HOLDING THE LOU MROZEK
MURDER WEAPON.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.243
I WENT TO SEE
YOUR BROTHER, OMAR.

27:30.243 --> 27:32.245
STILL GOT
ANOTHER 18 MONTHS, RIGHT?

27:32.245 --> 27:34.747
YEAH,
YOU'RE GOOD AT MATH.

27:34.747 --> 27:36.249
I HEARD THEY MIGHT
HAVE TO TRANSFER HIM.

27:36.249 --> 27:37.917
OVERCROWDING, YOU KNOW.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.086
HERE'S THE THING.

27:40.086 --> 27:43.089
THERE'S THIS SWANK ADULT
TRANSITION FACILITY, CROSSROADS.

27:43.089 --> 27:45.091
IT'S GOT SOME
GREAT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS.

27:45.091 --> 27:47.594
COULD GET A G.E.D.,
LEARN SOME TRADE.

27:47.594 --> 27:49.062
PLACE IS LIKE A DAMN SPA.

27:49.062 --> 27:50.396
SOUNDS GOOD.

27:50.396 --> 27:52.732
ON THE OTHER HAND,
YOU KNOW STATEVILLE?

27:52.732 --> 27:54.067
IT'S HOME
TO THE UGLIEST BUNCH

27:54.067 --> 27:57.237
OF KILLERS AND RAPISTS
IN ILLINOIS.

27:57.237 --> 27:59.639
I WOULD HATE TO SEE OMAR
END UP THERE.

28:07.447 --> 28:09.449
CALL ME.

28:09.449 --> 28:12.452
I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF I HEAR
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

28:14.220 --> 28:18.224
HEY. HEY.

28:18.224 --> 28:20.894
THE GUN WAS
IN THE KID'S CAR.

28:33.072 --> 28:35.241
I JUST
GOT BACK INTO TOWN.

28:35.241 --> 28:37.410
IS THIS REALLY SO IMPORTANT
IT COULDN'T WAIT?

28:37.410 --> 28:40.380
I'M IN TROUBLE, QUINCY.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.649
I NEED OUT OF MY COVER.

28:48.467 --> 28:51.137
HEY, BREAKFAST SOON.
OH, GREAT.

28:51.137 --> 28:53.639
HOW YOU DOING?
HEY.

28:53.639 --> 28:55.975
HOW FAR DID YOU GO?

28:55.975 --> 28:58.144
OH, NOT TOO FAR.
A COUPLE MILES.

28:58.144 --> 29:01.180
YOU RUN THE WHOLE WAY?
YEP.

29:01.180 --> 29:03.482
I'M NOT AS FAST
AS I USED TO BE.

29:05.818 --> 29:07.653
I HEAR THERE'S GONNA
BE PANCAKES SOON.

29:14.693 --> 29:16.195
IS T.J. KARSTEN IN?

29:16.195 --> 29:18.597
I'M DREW STAFFORD,
STATE'S ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

29:18.597 --> 29:20.933
MR. STAFFORD?

29:20.933 --> 29:23.235
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

29:23.235 --> 29:26.405
YES, I BOUGHT HIM
THE IMPALA.

29:26.405 --> 29:28.407
WELL, I HAVE EVIDENCE
IT WAS PARKED

29:28.407 --> 29:29.575
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

29:29.575 --> 29:31.010
AT THE GARAGE
WHERE LIL' D WORKED.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.245
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THAT IS.

29:33.245 --> 29:35.080
REAL NAME,
DARIUS MILLER.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.750
HE WAS FOUND DEAD WITH THE GUN
USED TO SHOOT LOU MROZEK.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.618
LIL' D IS
THE PRESUMED KILLER.

29:39.618 --> 29:41.954
PRESUMED BY SOME,
BUT NOT BY YOU, IS THAT IT?

29:41.954 --> 29:43.455
NOW YOU'RE CATCHING ON.

29:43.455 --> 29:45.457
AND WHY IS THAT,
MR. STAFFORD?

29:45.457 --> 29:47.059
BECAUSE
THIS CAR BEING THERE

29:47.059 --> 29:49.261
AND LIL' D USING
THE MROZEK MURDER WEAPON,

29:49.261 --> 29:51.230
THAT'S JUST TOO BIG
OF A COINCIDENCE.

29:51.230 --> 29:52.698
I ALSO HAVE A WITNESS
WHO TELLS ME

29:52.698 --> 29:54.366
LIL' D GOT THE GUN
FROM YOUR SON'S CAR.

29:54.366 --> 29:56.602
WHY WOULD IT
HAVE BEEN THERE?

29:56.602 --> 29:57.736
SOMEONE WAS HIDING IT --

29:57.736 --> 29:59.371
SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY
KILLED LOU MROZEK.

29:59.371 --> 30:01.240
T.J. AGAIN?
OR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HIM,

30:01.240 --> 30:03.609
SOMEONE WITH ACCESS
TO THE IMPALA.

30:03.609 --> 30:06.946
THIS INVESTIGATION
IS ACTIVE.

30:06.946 --> 30:08.614
I'M GONNA FIND OUT
WHO PUT THE GUN THERE.

30:08.614 --> 30:12.284
AND WHEN I DO, SOMEONE IS
GOING DOWN FOR MURDER.

30:12.284 --> 30:14.253
TALK TO YOUR SON.

30:22.061 --> 30:25.231
WHY ARE WE STOPPING HERE?

30:25.231 --> 30:27.399
JACK?

30:32.805 --> 30:35.975
JACK? ARE YOU OKAY?

30:37.476 --> 30:40.813
LOOK. I DIDN'T GO
RUNNING BEFORE.

30:40.813 --> 30:44.016
I KNOW.
WHO WAS SHE?

30:44.016 --> 30:46.852
IT'S A FEDERAL AGENT,
LOOKING INTO KARSTEN.

30:46.852 --> 30:49.355
SHE WANTS ME
TO HELP THEM.

30:49.355 --> 30:52.024
WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

30:52.024 --> 30:55.361
THAT I CAN'T
AND THAT I NEVER WILL.

30:55.361 --> 30:57.429
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

30:57.429 --> 31:00.165
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET YOU
INTO IT.

31:00.165 --> 31:01.967
BUT I AM IN IT, JACK.
WE'RE BOTH ARE.

31:01.967 --> 31:04.470
IT'S HARD...
TO PROTECT YOU

31:04.470 --> 31:06.438
AND -- AND TELL YOU EVERYTHING
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:06.438 --> 31:08.107
I NEVER ASKED
TO BE PROTECTED.

31:08.107 --> 31:10.109
WHAT I WANT IS TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

31:10.109 --> 31:12.811
FOR US TO BE REAL
WITH EACH OTHER.

31:16.782 --> 31:19.451
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID,

31:19.451 --> 31:21.453
HOW TO MAKE IT LAST,

31:21.453 --> 31:23.989
NOT LET IT JUST BE
SOME EVOLUTIONARY TRICK.

31:23.989 --> 31:25.658
I WAS BEING SILLY.

31:25.658 --> 31:30.362
NO, HERE'S HOW --
BY BEING TOGETHER.

31:30.362 --> 31:32.965
REALLY TOGETHER,

31:32.965 --> 31:35.000
IN A WAY THAT I NEVER WAS
WITH ELAINE

31:35.000 --> 31:36.669
AND YOU NEVER WERE
WITH DREW.

31:36.669 --> 31:40.239
AND WHATEVER COMES,
WHATEVER CHALLENGES,

31:40.239 --> 31:43.409
WE'LL FACE THEM TOGETHER.

31:43.409 --> 31:47.246
WELL,
THAT'S WHAT<i> I</i> WANT.

31:47.246 --> 31:49.315
I HOPE WE CAN DO THAT.

31:49.315 --> 31:51.817
WE CAN.

31:55.321 --> 31:59.992
I PROMISE...THAT I WILL NEVER
SHUT YOU OUT AGAIN.

31:59.992 --> 32:04.830
AND I WILL NEVER HIDE ANYTHING
OR HAVE ANY SECRETS.

32:06.598 --> 32:08.767
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

32:14.807 --> 32:17.810
YES.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.479
I DO.

32:37.262 --> 32:39.264
LOOK, I'M JUST BACK FROM
TRYING TO POSITION McALLISTER,

32:39.264 --> 32:40.766
AND HE'S HOLDING FIRM.

32:40.766 --> 32:42.768
YOUR LEAD ON HIS WIFE MIGHT BE
THE ONLY WAY TO FLIP HIM.

32:42.768 --> 32:43.936
BUT WHAT IF WE GOT
SOMEBODY BETTER?

32:43.936 --> 32:45.938
LIKE WHO?
JULES WHITMAN.

32:45.938 --> 32:48.107
SHE'S AN I.T. TECH
AT KARSTEN ALLIED,

32:48.107 --> 32:51.643
AND SHE'S VALERIE'S GIRLFRIEND,
KARSTEN'S GRANDDAUGHTER.

32:51.643 --> 32:52.945
SHE'S GOT A RECORD.

32:52.945 --> 32:54.947
LOOK.

32:54.947 --> 32:56.949
SHE WAS CONVICTED LAST YEAR
IN SEATTLE

32:56.949 --> 33:00.452
FOR COMPUTER HACKING WITH INTENT
TO DISRUPT THE I.R.S.

33:00.452 --> 33:02.755
SHE'S A RADICAL
WITH A RECORD

33:02.755 --> 33:04.757
AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS
AT KARSTEN ALLIED.

33:04.757 --> 33:06.492
THIS GIRL COULD BE
A GOLD MINE.

33:06.492 --> 33:07.659
WHAT ABOUT ELAINE?

33:07.659 --> 33:09.728
I DON'T THINK
SHE HAS MUCH VALUE TO US.

33:09.728 --> 33:11.063
SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

33:15.300 --> 33:18.637
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
IT'S AN OBSTACLE.

33:18.637 --> 33:20.506
WHAT SORT OF OBSTACLE?

33:20.506 --> 33:23.208
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP.

33:25.310 --> 33:27.813
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.

33:32.584 --> 33:36.588
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.
YOUR ASSIGNMENT'S NOT CHANGING.

33:53.839 --> 33:54.840
HELLO?

33:54.840 --> 33:57.709
Sara Hanley?

34:09.154 --> 34:12.658
MR. KARSTEN.
I'M LOOKING FOR JACK.

34:12.658 --> 34:14.893
HE'S GONE TO PARK THE CAR.

34:14.893 --> 34:18.063
FINE. I'LL WAIT.

34:26.404 --> 34:30.075
COME IN.

34:32.210 --> 34:35.213
HEY.

34:35.213 --> 34:37.215
I THINK I NEED TO GET
MY HOUSE KEY BACK FROM YOU.

34:38.783 --> 34:40.619
LOOK, I DON'T WANT US
TO BE OVER,

34:40.619 --> 34:42.320
AND I DON'T THINK YOU DO,
EITHER.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.657
THERE'S JUST TOO
MUCH UNCERTAINTY
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

34:45.657 --> 34:49.060
WE'RE TEENAGERS.
NOTHING IS CERTAIN.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.228
AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW,

34:50.228 --> 34:52.697
THIS RELATIONSHIP FEELS LIKE
KIND OF A BIG DEAL,

34:52.697 --> 34:54.466
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THROW IT AWAY

34:54.466 --> 34:56.468
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED
OF GETTING HURT.

34:56.468 --> 34:59.170
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

35:04.175 --> 35:06.344
I PROMISE
NOT TO CHEAT ON YOU...

35:06.344 --> 35:12.017
...OR LIE TO YOU,
OR FORCE YOU TO LOVE MY DOG.

35:20.659 --> 35:23.161
UH, YOU HAVE TO GO.

35:23.161 --> 35:25.463
MY KIDS COULD BE HERE.

35:25.463 --> 35:28.466
SO?
YOU SAID VAL KNOWS.

35:28.466 --> 35:30.302
WELL, KNOWING YOU EXIST
IS ONE THING,

35:30.302 --> 35:33.638
BUT SEEING ME DRAG YOU
INTO MY BEDROOM IS...

35:33.638 --> 35:35.640
THAT'S ANOTHER.

35:35.640 --> 35:39.144
SO, IS ANYBODY HOME?

35:39.144 --> 35:41.980
NO.
GOOD.

35:58.697 --> 36:02.200
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.370
AWW, I LIKE YOU, TOO.

36:05.370 --> 36:10.709
BUT I JUST ENDED A 20-YEAR
MARRIAGE 5 MINUTES AGO,

36:10.709 --> 36:13.878
AND, UH, I'M INCREDIBLY LATE
FOR WORK.

36:13.878 --> 36:17.215
I HAVE TO CLOSE TONIGHT.

36:17.215 --> 36:21.953
ELAINE, I NEED TO SAY
SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE.

36:26.257 --> 36:29.928
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
GET SOMEONE ELSE TO CLOSE.

36:37.002 --> 36:39.337
I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG JACK WILL BE.

36:39.337 --> 36:43.508
IT'S BIZARRE, ISN'T IT?
THIS IS HOW IT ALL STARTED.

36:43.508 --> 36:45.176
IF YOU HADN'T CHOSEN ME
AS A SUBJECT,

36:45.176 --> 36:47.679
IF YOU'D BEEN
ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER,

36:47.679 --> 36:50.849
WE'D ALL BE A LOT HAPPIER
RIGHT NOW, WOULDN'T WE?

36:50.849 --> 36:53.918
I WISH THINGS
COULD BE DIFFERENT. I DO.

36:53.918 --> 36:55.253
WHAT?

36:55.253 --> 36:57.956
YOU THINK ALL THIS
WAS INEVITABLE?

36:57.956 --> 37:02.293
IT'S NOT ALL THAT HARD TO WALK
AWAY, YOU KNOW, TO JUST MOVE ON.

37:02.293 --> 37:03.795
PEOPLE
DO IT ALL THE TIME.

37:03.795 --> 37:07.265
LOOK, MR. KARSTEN.
JACK CARES ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

37:07.265 --> 37:09.034
HE'LL NEVER TURN ON YOU.

37:09.034 --> 37:12.637
PEOPLE WANT HIM TO,
BUT HE WON'T.

37:12.637 --> 37:14.773
THAT'S HOW LOYAL HE IS
TO YOU.

37:14.773 --> 37:18.109
LOYALTY IS NOT THE FIRST WORD
THAT COMES TO MIND

37:18.109 --> 37:21.780
TO DESCRIBE JACK,
AT LEAST NOT SINCE HE MET YOU.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.987
THATCHER.

37:28.987 --> 37:32.190
I'LL BE IN THE BACK ROOM.
I HAVE SOME PRINTS DRYING.

37:35.827 --> 37:39.330
IS THIS REALLY
WHAT YOU WANT, JACK?

37:39.330 --> 37:42.167
TO LIVE OUT
THIS RIDICULOUS DREAM?

37:42.167 --> 37:45.637
YOU'RE NOT 20 YEARS OLD
ANYMORE.

37:45.637 --> 37:48.807
HOW LONG BEFORE YOU STOP
AND ASK YOURSELF,

37:48.807 --> 37:51.342
"WHAT WAS I THINKING?

37:51.342 --> 37:55.346
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
A YEAR?

37:55.346 --> 37:58.850
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT HAPPENS,
WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS.

37:58.850 --> 38:02.320
YOU WAKE UP.

38:02.320 --> 38:06.024
I'M NOT COMING BACK,
THATCHER.

38:06.024 --> 38:10.528
I'M NOT GONNA ASK AGAIN,
YOU KNOW.

38:10.528 --> 38:13.298
YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.188
HELLO?

39:10.188 --> 39:11.856
Jules Whitman?

39:11.856 --> 39:14.526
This is Quincy Theringer
from the FBI.

39:14.526 --> 39:17.328
We need to talk.

39:18.997 --> 39:20.665
<i>OH, COME ON.</i>

39:20.665 --> 39:22.834
<i>OKAY. MY TURN.</i>

39:22.834 --> 39:27.172
<i>COME ON. LET'S GO.</i>
<i>I GOT IT! I GOT IT!</i>

39:27.172 --> 39:29.240
POP?

39:31.242 --> 39:34.579
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME
TONIGHT.

39:34.579 --> 39:36.714
I T-THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE MAD AT ME.

39:36.714 --> 39:39.617
YOU FEELING BETTER?

39:39.617 --> 39:43.054
YEAH. ALL BETTER.

39:43.054 --> 39:46.891
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY,
T.J.?

39:46.891 --> 39:49.861
DID YOU MAKE A MISTAKE TAKING
YOUR MEDICATION?

39:49.861 --> 39:52.530
I DID.

39:54.699 --> 39:56.367
WAS IT ON PURPOSE?

39:56.367 --> 39:59.537
WELL, I GOT CONFUSED.

39:59.537 --> 40:02.607
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
I PROMISE.

40:02.607 --> 40:05.944
COME HERE.

40:08.980 --> 40:12.317
<i>I MADE IT!</i>
<i>YAY!</i>

40:12.317 --> 40:15.653
IS THAT ME AND JACK?
YEAH.

40:15.653 --> 40:18.323
YOU BOTH TRIED OUT
FOR FOOTBALL THAT YEAR.

40:18.323 --> 40:20.592
YOU MADE IT. HE DIDN'T.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.094
BUT YOU WOULDN'T JOIN THE TEAM
WITHOUT HIM.

40:23.094 --> 40:26.731
WELL,
HE WAS MY BROTHER.

40:28.633 --> 40:31.135
HE WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING FOR YOU.

40:31.135 --> 40:34.806
YEAH, HE WOULD.
DON'T SAY THAT.

40:37.775 --> 40:41.713
JACK'S NEVER COMING BACK,
IS HE, DAD?

40:44.883 --> 40:47.051
NO.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.522
WE HAVE TO FORGET
ABOUT JACK.

40:51.522 --> 40:53.524
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW.

40:58.997 --> 41:02.500
ARE YOU OKAY?

41:05.003 --> 41:06.504
HE SAVED ME.

41:06.504 --> 41:10.341
I MEAN, HE TOOK ME
INTO HIS FAMILY

41:10.341 --> 41:12.176
WHEN HE COULD HAVE
JUST LET ME DISAPPEAR

41:12.176 --> 41:14.846
INTO THE FOSTER SYSTEM,

41:14.846 --> 41:19.517
SOME IMMIGRANT KID LOST
IN THE MESS.

41:19.517 --> 41:22.854
MAYBE SOMEDAY
HE'LL FORGIVE YOU.

41:25.189 --> 41:27.191
NOT A CHANCE.

41:35.466 --> 41:38.136
YOU'RE LATE.

41:38.136 --> 41:40.972
MY APOLOGIES.

41:40.972 --> 41:43.841
THANKS FOR COMING.

41:43.841 --> 41:46.244
MAKE IT WORTH MY WHILE.

41:46.244 --> 41:49.447
I WANT TO COOPERATE.
DO YOU?

41:49.447 --> 41:51.482
SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

41:54.018 --> 41:57.555
IT'S --
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

41:57.555 --> 42:02.226
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY
I WANTED TO KEEP THIS A SECRET.

42:02.226 --> 42:05.730
THOSE REASONS ARE NOT AS
COMPELLING AS THEY USED TO BE.

42:05.730 --> 42:08.099
WHAT SECRET IS THAT?

42:08.099 --> 42:13.504
THE PERSON WHO PUT THE GUN IN
T.J.'s CAR WAS JACK McALLISTER.

42:15.506 --> 42:19.477
JACK IS THE ONE
WHO KILLED LOU MROZEK.
