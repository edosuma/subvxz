WEBVTT

01:19.557 --> 01:20.950
: That's the cleanup crew

01:20.993 --> 01:22.995
up on the track,
and that's a lot of racers

01:23.039 --> 01:25.737
involved there, folks.-

01:38.446 --> 01:42.450
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

01:42.493 --> 01:44.689
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.169
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.150
- Last two laps.
- On it!

01:47.194 --> 01:48.456
Get those plug wires!

01:48.499 --> 01:50.153
Jakob! Now.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.895
Hey, pop.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.331
Tell me what you see, dom.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.743
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.465
Bell's driving safe.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.269
Corbin's got a sponsor in
the stands, so he's pushing it.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.598
: Talking about me?

02:00.642 --> 02:02.209
You got a real problem
with car 23.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.820
- Linder.
- Man: About to whip your ass, toretto!

02:04.863 --> 02:06.604
- Settle down, pretty boy!
- That's right.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.538
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you. You want to tell your driver

02:08.562 --> 02:10.062
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- What'd you say?

02:10.086 --> 02:11.237
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

02:11.261 --> 02:12.741
He's just pissed I got that spot

02:12.784 --> 02:14.371
in the busch series
next season, not him.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.049
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny linder.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.268
You're good!

02:20.836 --> 02:23.795
It's not about being
the stronger man, dom.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.884
It's about being the bigger one.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.480
I swear to god, this guy.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.750
Pop, turn two, turn two!

03:09.711 --> 03:12.235
-Got it. I'm walking him in.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.546
Shit!

03:28.512 --> 03:29.948
Tell me what you see, dom.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.695
He's gonna come at you for that.

03:44.789 --> 03:45.921
Get ready on your left.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.596
Three-eighths ratchet.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.081
Three-eighths driver.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.910
Six-inch extension.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.089
Are you sure?

05:18.927 --> 05:21.190
Remember what your daddy
told you.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.671
Be precise in life.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.194
It can make all the difference.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.935
Now, watch this.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.286
- See how it's working now?
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.375
And you see what's happening?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.899
It's turning the screw.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.249
You're right.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.077
Water heater's out again.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.863
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.214
Want to come and give us a hand?

05:49.044 --> 05:51.481
Are you expecting someone?

05:54.136 --> 05:55.659
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.034
Yo, yo!

06:23.078 --> 06:26.908
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

06:29.737 --> 06:32.130
It's me!

06:32.174 --> 06:34.437
Roman?
Maybe you don't recognize me

06:34.481 --> 06:36.439
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.402
B, come out, son.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.455
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.520
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

06:54.544 --> 06:56.416
We would've called first.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.201
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.681
You know that, right?

07:00.724 --> 07:02.509
- Little b!
- Wow, you're so big.

07:02.552 --> 07:03.901
- Hi. -Tej: Wow. Hi.
-

07:03.945 --> 07:06.904
now, I know you don't carpool.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.603
So what's up?

07:09.646 --> 07:11.213
: Mayday! Mayday!

07:11.256 --> 07:14.390
My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!

07:16.784 --> 07:19.613
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.397
I need you to assemble the team.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.268
: Still alive. I'll explain...

07:25.140 --> 07:28.622
It's an sos transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.711
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

07:30.754 --> 07:32.539
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.212
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.630
He sent it only to us.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.806
Why just us?

07:47.379 --> 07:48.598
He caught cipher.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.382
But there was a midair attack,

07:50.426 --> 07:52.123
and she was extracted.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.083
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

07:55.126 --> 07:57.477
over the northwest region
of montequinto.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.001
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.698
But the whole area's sealed off.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.395
Isolationist, run by military.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.310
We're not on call anymore.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.055
Wait, wait.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.797
Dom, this is cipher.

08:13.841 --> 08:17.105
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.371
Things change.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.858
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 A.M.,

08:30.901 --> 08:33.337
if you change your mind.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.905
Thank you.

08:37.604 --> 08:40.345
Daddy, do you know where god is?

08:40.389 --> 08:42.433
- Where is god?
- In your heart.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.959
He's in your heart, too.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.569
And you know something?

08:46.613 --> 08:49.311
I'll always be in your heart.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.573
Hey, little guy.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.836
I have a gift for you.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.839
Your father gave this to me.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.713
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.630
It's very special.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.196
Take care of it.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.171
: Good night.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.097
This isn't who we are.

09:39.448 --> 09:42.712
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.237
We're not them.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.846
: Under attack by a rogue agent!

10:29.890 --> 10:33.197
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.546
: Assemble the team.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.461
Still alive. I'll explain...

10:37.767 --> 10:39.682
alive. I'll explain...

11:18.765 --> 11:21.028
Y quiero velocidad...

11:30.951 --> 11:32.909
Coming up on the signal,
two miles.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.651
It's deep in the militarized
zone of montequinto.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.827
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.481
Y'all want to make jokes
about me

11:39.524 --> 11:41.309
not making practical decisions?

11:41.352 --> 11:43.267
This is as prepared as it gets.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.095
We all see you, man.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.794
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.283
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.590
Careful's when you get hurt.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.431
Right now, we have

12:16.474 --> 12:18.128
a ten-minute window
between patrols.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.043
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.437
but we've got
to move quickly, guys.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.613
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.772
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

13:10.485 --> 13:14.402
The source of the sos signal is
coming from inside this thing.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.711
Somebody wanted in.

13:19.755 --> 13:22.802
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.674
Or it was sent down
on purpose to stop 'em.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.807
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.287
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

13:32.855 --> 13:34.030
Dom.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.989
There's not a soul in sight.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.252
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

13:38.295 --> 13:39.993
Got it.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.653
What the hell is this?

13:48.697 --> 13:51.569
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

13:52.483 --> 13:53.702
How's that work...-

13:53.745 --> 13:55.486
go!

14:32.828 --> 14:35.787
What?! You don't know who I am?!

14:35.831 --> 14:37.267
You think I'm scared?!

16:02.091 --> 16:04.354
Roman, where the hell are you?!

16:10.317 --> 16:13.973
Who's compensating now, tej?!

16:37.213 --> 16:39.999
"Peligro minas."
What does that mean?

16:40.042 --> 16:41.454
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

16:41.478 --> 16:42.958
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

16:43.002 --> 16:44.240
- what I think you're thinking.
- Why?

16:44.264 --> 16:46.005
What does "peligro minas" mean?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.181
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.486
Somebody answer me!

16:49.530 --> 16:50.966
What does "peligro minas" mean?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.272
"Peligro minas" means

16:52.315 --> 16:54.230
- "danger, land mines"!
- What?!

16:57.146 --> 16:58.930
How fast, tej?

16:58.974 --> 17:00.584
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius

17:00.628 --> 17:03.413
and a-a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.762
I can't!

17:04.806 --> 17:06.982
My speedometer
only goes up to 70.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.202
- What do I do?!
- You put your foot to that floor,

17:09.244 --> 17:10.244
and you pray!

17:56.423 --> 17:59.643
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

18:39.814 --> 18:40.945
Whoa!

18:52.261 --> 18:54.045
Whoa!

18:56.918 --> 18:58.137
Roman, you good?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.578
My ass is en fuego!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.676
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

20:31.012 --> 20:33.014
How in the hell
are you not dead?

20:43.590 --> 20:45.853
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.595
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

20:48.638 --> 20:51.467
Good. The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.211
Letty, on the right.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.990
The device.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.142
Get in.

22:18.206 --> 22:21.340
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

22:51.848 --> 22:54.068
Always check your mirrors,
bitches!

22:55.112 --> 22:56.375
Oh, hell no.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.656
Are we supposed to drive
across that?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.074
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

23:12.826 --> 23:15.655
Oh, my god!

23:35.326 --> 23:36.980
The military's not giving up.

23:37.024 --> 23:38.417
We got to get past the border.

24:35.648 --> 24:36.779
Where's the bridge?

24:41.218 --> 24:43.133
No. No, no.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.483
Dom.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.694
Well, that was new.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.193
Look, we're in the clear.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.109
But this thing is a mess.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.329
The headlines out there?

25:48.372 --> 25:51.724
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

25:51.767 --> 25:55.423
Followed by some kind of
covert ops firefight?

25:55.466 --> 25:58.034
I'll get you where you need...

25:58.078 --> 26:00.123
And then I'm gonna need
to back off.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.174
I appreciate the favor.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.267
I got to stop doing
so many favors.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.794
What we doing, Ramsey?

26:18.838 --> 26:20.187
Like, where are we going?

26:20.230 --> 26:23.059
I-I was able to decrypt the data

26:23.103 --> 26:24.931
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's sos,

26:24.974 --> 26:28.587
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.982
You knew about Jakob?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.856
Question: Who is Jakob?

26:36.899 --> 26:39.641
Jakob is...

26:39.685 --> 26:41.382
Or was dom's brother.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.692
Oh, my-my bad.

26:46.735 --> 26:49.651
I'm sorry. I'm just processing.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.871
Brother?

26:51.914 --> 26:53.742
You got a brother?

26:53.786 --> 26:57.398
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

26:57.441 --> 26:59.748
with his own private army,

26:59.792 --> 27:02.316
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

27:02.359 --> 27:04.710
who preplanned an aerial jump

27:04.753 --> 27:07.016
and landed at the bottom
of an airplane?

27:07.060 --> 27:09.149
Who does that?

27:09.192 --> 27:12.543
Who does that? A toretto.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.287
That's my dad! That's my dad!

27:17.331 --> 27:19.681
-He's gone! He's gone!

27:19.725 --> 27:21.291
We got to get him out of there.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.642
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

27:25.731 --> 27:28.995
That's my dad! That's my dad!

27:29.038 --> 27:30.649
That's my dad!

27:30.692 --> 27:33.086
Get him out of there!

27:33.129 --> 27:34.565
That's my dad!

27:40.267 --> 27:44.184
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.273
Few clearances.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.888
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

28:18.261 --> 28:20.176
Hey.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.266
Nobody's supposed to be
around here.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.791
You toretto's other son?

28:25.834 --> 28:27.793
You're the useless one, right?

28:33.799 --> 28:35.626
What is that?

28:35.670 --> 28:38.978
Get out of here. Go.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.328
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

28:41.371 --> 28:42.808
That's what that is?

28:42.851 --> 28:43.983
No.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.375
No, not you.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.725
You're the one that killed him.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.639
No, racing killed him.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.313
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall.

28:50.337 --> 28:51.947
He knew that.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.533
Now, I don't know if
he dropped gear. I don't know.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.777
I swear... I swear to god,

28:55.821 --> 28:57.866
- if you don't get out of here...
- What? What?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.085
Go find buddy.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.869
Now!

29:05.961 --> 29:09.312
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.491
Leave.

29:15.492 --> 29:17.233
You here to make threats, too?

29:17.277 --> 29:19.932
"Leave" is a simple word.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.543
Man, what is it
with you torettos

29:22.586 --> 29:24.806
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

29:24.850 --> 29:27.548
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

29:27.591 --> 29:31.030
You, your dad, me...
We're all stuck,

29:31.073 --> 29:34.294
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.383
And we ain't never getting out.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.779
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

29:42.215 --> 29:44.695
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

29:44.739 --> 29:46.610
Get off me!

29:46.654 --> 29:48.090
Dom! Dom!

29:48.134 --> 29:50.266
Dom!-

29:50.310 --> 29:52.225
dom, no! Dom!-

29:52.268 --> 29:53.835
no, man!-

30:11.070 --> 30:12.811
In here.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.532
Jakob.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.727
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.537
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.017
I got this off the cockpit feed.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.193
Oh, I love being rich.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.282
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.502
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

30:52.546 --> 30:55.418
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

30:55.462 --> 30:58.073
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

30:58.117 --> 31:00.162
Is that weird?

31:02.991 --> 31:04.819
Nice operation.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.474
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

31:07.517 --> 31:09.606
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.044
Money well spent.

31:13.480 --> 31:16.570
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.745
Do you?

31:20.226 --> 31:22.924
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

31:25.100 --> 31:29.539
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.627
Isn't it?

31:33.587 --> 31:37.939
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than dom.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.854
Smarter than dom.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.988
Stronger than dom.

31:44.685 --> 31:50.169
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

31:52.084 --> 31:53.781
: Still?

31:56.218 --> 31:58.394
All these years later?

32:02.137 --> 32:03.834
I should've just hired you

32:03.878 --> 32:06.576
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.100
I don't work
for the competition.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.797
That's cute.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.320
You thinking
you're the competition.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.540
Says the woman in the box.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.327
Look familiar?

32:18.371 --> 32:19.981
The other half's hidden

32:20.025 --> 32:23.071
in one of the agency's
thousands of vaults.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.856
I need you to find out
which one.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.469
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.210
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

32:31.253 --> 32:33.038
Pre-Internet.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.517
To make sure you don't go

32:34.561 --> 32:36.563
hack into anything
we don't want you to.

32:38.478 --> 32:41.394
Say you get what you're after.

32:41.437 --> 32:43.526
A weapon so dangerous
it shouldn't exist

32:43.570 --> 32:44.614
for another half century.

32:44.658 --> 32:45.964
What would you do with it?

32:46.007 --> 32:48.227
Launch some global attack?

32:48.270 --> 32:50.533
Sell it to the highest bidder?

32:50.577 --> 32:53.928
Or maybe you see yourself

32:53.972 --> 32:56.670
as a necessary shock
to the system.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.803
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

32:59.847 --> 33:03.024
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

33:03.068 --> 33:06.245
I read your second-grade
report card.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.334
That's what I do.

33:17.256 --> 33:20.172
Your chin... it's distinctive.

33:21.956 --> 33:25.003
I know the torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

33:25.046 --> 33:28.006
but I never detected
a nordic strain.

33:37.363 --> 33:41.584
Finding the two halves of
project aries is the easy part.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.673
Add in your brother dom
to the mix?

33:43.717 --> 33:45.980
: You don't have a chance.

33:46.981 --> 33:49.114
Plans are in motion.

33:52.943 --> 33:54.902
Qasar Khan.

33:56.643 --> 33:57.687
What?

33:58.688 --> 34:00.342
Genghis Khan's little brother.

34:04.129 --> 34:05.782
Nobody's heard of him either.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.462
Talk about off the grid.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.725
I don't think they had grids

34:35.768 --> 34:37.422
when this place was built.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.730
If a ninja turtle pop out on me,

34:40.774 --> 34:42.732
tell you right now, I'm out.

34:42.775 --> 34:45.605
No way this place was
sanctioned by the agency.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.695
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.270
What now, dom?

35:00.489 --> 35:02.535
Whoever Jakob has become...

35:05.015 --> 35:07.061
and whatever he's up to...

35:11.544 --> 35:14.024
it's on me.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.156
And me alone.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.636
Nah.

35:16.679 --> 35:20.814
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

35:20.857 --> 35:22.511
Let's get to work.

35:39.224 --> 35:43.141
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on?

35:43.184 --> 35:45.360
How we somehow...

35:45.404 --> 35:47.710
- Always survive?
- Yeah.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.148
- So far, so good, I guess.
- It's just luck.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.106
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.239
Think about this.

35:54.282 --> 35:57.416
We've now been
on insane missions

35:57.459 --> 36:01.246
around the world,
doing what most would say is

36:01.289 --> 36:02.899
damn near impossible.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.772
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

36:05.815 --> 36:08.035
I mean, look at my jacket.

36:09.210 --> 36:13.649
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

36:13.693 --> 36:15.216
clean off its shoulders.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.306
We've taken out
cars, trains, tanks.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.265
I'm not gonna even
mention the submarine.

36:20.308 --> 36:23.224
And yet we're still here.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.747
Exactly.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.575
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

36:26.619 --> 36:29.665
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

36:29.709 --> 36:31.189
A hypothesis becomes fact.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.775
But you're not actually
suggesting that...

36:32.799 --> 36:34.714
I don't know,
but when the improbable happens

36:34.757 --> 36:37.630
again and again,
that's more than luck.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.807
Maybe we're not so normal.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.765
That's what I'm saying.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.332
We are not normal.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.813
Okay, um...

36:46.856 --> 36:48.815
Just to clarify,

36:48.858 --> 36:51.687
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

36:51.731 --> 36:53.341
invincible?

36:54.342 --> 36:56.779
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

36:59.173 --> 37:01.001
Or maybe...

37:01.044 --> 37:02.481
You're just a dumb-ass.

37:06.528 --> 37:10.097
Take your dumb-ass jacket
with you, man.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.585
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.023
You miss the old life.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.330
Do you?

37:28.898 --> 37:30.073
Every day.

37:31.901 --> 37:33.338
Guys.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.255
We got a little company.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.648
Think you know this person.

37:41.084 --> 37:44.523
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.481
Thank you.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.222
: Of course.

37:51.486 --> 37:53.532
You should've told me.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.231
She deserved to know.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.540
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

38:01.583 --> 38:05.370
You get involved here, you put
everything you have at risk.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.678
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.551
We're all risking something.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.816
Dom, listen to me.

38:16.859 --> 38:21.037
My kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible.

38:21.081 --> 38:22.125
With Brian.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.738
Our world's grown, dom.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.871
I got this one.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.011
The firewall on this old thing

38:38.054 --> 38:39.360
is actually pretty good.

38:39.404 --> 38:42.102
But, you know, port scan,
udp message peek,

38:42.145 --> 38:44.104
pop to root shell, and...

38:46.149 --> 38:48.456
say hello to project aries.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.979
What is it?

38:50.023 --> 38:51.677
It's what we got from
Mr. Nobody's plane.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.983
Or at least part of it.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.942
Aries was designed
to override and assimilate

38:55.985 --> 38:57.683
anything that runs on code.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.380
Any computer anywhere.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.556
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.516
If you take aries
and upload it to a satellite,

39:04.559 --> 39:06.866
it'll spread like a virus.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.303
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

39:09.347 --> 39:12.175
any weapon system...
Traditional, nuclear,

39:12.219 --> 39:13.568
stuff we haven't even seen yet...

39:13.612 --> 39:16.179
And just point it
wherever they want.

39:16.223 --> 39:21.750
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

39:21.794 --> 39:24.492
Ares is the god of war, right?

39:24.536 --> 39:26.538
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

39:26.581 --> 39:29.758
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

39:29.802 --> 39:31.717
Because of how dangerous it was,

39:31.760 --> 39:33.196
the aries prototype
was recovered

39:33.240 --> 39:35.285
and split into two halves
by Mr. Nobody.

39:35.329 --> 39:38.767
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

39:38.811 --> 39:41.204
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.424
He'll be going after
the other half next.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.862
As for the key, it's...
It's vanished.

39:46.906 --> 39:48.081
So we find it.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.865
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,

39:49.909 --> 39:51.432
we're gonna have to split up.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.608
Roman, tej,
I know a couple of guys

39:53.652 --> 39:56.394
operating out of Germany that
could get us anything we need.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.917
I'm on it.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.179
Wait, there's one more thing.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.833
Mr. Nobody's transmission

40:00.876 --> 40:03.139
had one name
connected to the key.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.534
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.281
No way.

40:14.324 --> 40:16.109
That's exactly what I said.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.720
So you're saying
han's death is connected

40:18.764 --> 40:20.069
to all of this?

40:20.113 --> 40:22.245
He has to have
something to do with it.

40:22.289 --> 40:23.464
I'll look into it.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.074
Tej, can you send me

40:25.118 --> 40:27.207
- all the files you have on han?
- Yeah.

40:27.250 --> 40:29.470
I'll go with you.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.558
Letty.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.520
I got this the day han died.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.261
Mexico.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.828
Check the postmark.

40:39.872 --> 40:44.093
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.530
Tokyo.

40:45.573 --> 40:48.663
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

40:48.707 --> 40:51.144
I'm gonna find him.

40:53.538 --> 40:54.713
How?

40:55.714 --> 40:57.237
An old friend.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.527
Yo, what do you think?

41:26.571 --> 41:29.835
¿Es una ilusión o es real?

41:29.878 --> 41:31.924
It doesn't matter.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.534
It's all about
how you choose to see it.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.928
Shit. I told you I was right.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.279
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

41:39.322 --> 41:41.237
Dom. What are you guys in for?

41:41.281 --> 41:42.935
Driving while brown.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.165
You see that?

41:56.209 --> 41:57.950
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

41:57.993 --> 42:00.039
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

42:00.082 --> 42:01.997
Lean condition?

42:17.447 --> 42:19.406
And tasting the blood

42:19.449 --> 42:21.234
when she screamed and dropped

42:21.277 --> 42:22.888
caught the slug

42:22.931 --> 42:24.454
relate this to no choice-

42:24.498 --> 42:25.804
this straight-up man

42:27.370 --> 42:29.372
to the rhythm of a pop

42:29.416 --> 42:31.418
run is the first to get shot

42:31.461 --> 42:33.463
whoever said that what I say

42:35.161 --> 42:37.163
in the city with me

42:37.206 --> 42:39.426
in fact, they take that back

42:39.469 --> 42:40.949
deal with that...

42:49.218 --> 42:51.656
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

42:51.699 --> 42:54.006
That's what I'm talking about!

42:58.488 --> 43:00.142
Who wants next?

43:00.186 --> 43:01.927
I said, who wants next?!

43:01.970 --> 43:03.319
I got next.

43:05.931 --> 43:07.672
Dom.

43:08.673 --> 43:10.370
Well, when'd you get out, man?

43:10.413 --> 43:12.459
I said I got next.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.505
Come on, dom.

43:16.811 --> 43:19.553
You don't want to race me
in buddy's old charger.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.599
Car don't make the driver.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.912
Here's how this goes.

43:30.956 --> 43:33.001
You win...

43:33.045 --> 43:35.613
You can come back home.

43:35.656 --> 43:37.745
You lose...

43:37.789 --> 43:40.400
You keep driving,
you don't stop,

43:40.443 --> 43:43.185
you don't ever come back.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.797
Ever.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.189
What do you mean, dom?

43:47.233 --> 43:48.800
I know what you did.

43:50.758 --> 43:54.806
The day we lost him, dad kept
talking about a misfire.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.285
Remember?

43:57.460 --> 43:59.898
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

44:01.987 --> 44:04.598
A minute later, he was gone.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.906
Tell me why you killed dad.

44:15.130 --> 44:17.002
Now let's race.

44:22.442 --> 44:24.096
Armed robbery in echo park.-

44:24.139 --> 44:26.620
- fourth street bridge is open.
- Clear, clear, clear!

44:46.248 --> 44:48.729
Ready?-

44:48.773 --> 44:49.817
set.

44:51.297 --> 44:53.516
Go.-

44:53.560 --> 44:55.823
for the battleground

44:55.867 --> 44:57.085
will hunt you down

44:58.783 --> 45:00.523
you're not safe underground

45:00.567 --> 45:03.657
has been polarized

45:03.701 --> 45:05.746
to reveal the zeal

45:05.790 --> 45:07.400
get mobilized

45:07.443 --> 45:09.097
the American dream

45:10.708 --> 45:12.361
for the fighter jets

45:12.405 --> 45:13.928
to the middle east

45:13.972 --> 45:16.061
ten billion more dollars

45:16.104 --> 45:17.453
to feel safe to breathe

45:21.588 --> 45:24.417
what, what-

45:26.027 --> 45:29.074
and breathe.

46:01.802 --> 46:04.413
And breathe.

46:17.644 --> 46:18.776
Too soon.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.524
No!

46:54.333 --> 46:56.030
We gon' ride the night

46:56.074 --> 46:57.858
ride the night

46:57.902 --> 46:59.599
out the parking lot

47:01.731 --> 47:03.342
we gon' drag and drift

47:03.385 --> 47:05.257
and we pack the clip

47:05.300 --> 47:07.650
sound mad as hell

47:07.694 --> 47:11.176
whoa, whoa-

47:11.219 --> 47:14.962
na-na-na, whoa-

47:15.006 --> 47:17.399
: And beating the shortstop.

47:17.443 --> 47:20.489
-Line drive
over the head of Gonzalez

47:20.533 --> 47:22.535
on the field for a base hit.

47:24.493 --> 47:25.843
Up next...

47:28.846 --> 47:30.848
Place still looks the same.

47:32.719 --> 47:34.895
Just like your dad left it.

47:34.939 --> 47:37.506
I'm looking for Jakob.

47:40.727 --> 47:42.903
Can't help you, man.

47:42.947 --> 47:47.777
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

47:47.821 --> 47:50.693
The worst thing
you can do to a toretto

47:50.737 --> 47:52.782
is take away their family.

47:54.480 --> 47:57.352
That's what you did to Jakob.

47:57.396 --> 48:01.879
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

48:01.922 --> 48:04.055
He ain't got no one.

48:04.098 --> 48:05.795
You get in his way,
this ain't gonna end

48:05.839 --> 48:07.667
until one of you guys
are in the ground.

48:07.710 --> 48:10.191
I know you did
the best you could, buddy.

48:11.845 --> 48:15.370
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

48:27.426 --> 48:30.255
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

48:31.952 --> 48:34.172
But I'm no Jack toretto.

48:51.450 --> 48:54.322
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

48:56.542 --> 48:58.674
if you want hope for the future.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.380
He's in London.

49:08.423 --> 49:10.469
That's all I know.

49:21.132 --> 49:22.916
Dom.

49:26.137 --> 49:28.313
I hope you find your peace.

49:31.403 --> 49:34.449
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

49:58.865 --> 50:00.301
Arigato.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.263
This place is a dead end.

50:05.306 --> 50:08.135
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the han connection?

50:09.310 --> 50:12.531
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.971
I never told dom...

50:19.712 --> 50:22.758
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

50:23.890 --> 50:27.111
He was over at buddy's
for about a year, and then...

50:27.154 --> 50:29.374
He was gone with
a message not to follow.

50:30.592 --> 50:32.788
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

50:32.812 --> 50:35.728
that I would've...
Would've done anything.

50:35.771 --> 50:37.730
I even broke into
a police archive,

50:37.773 --> 50:39.123
but I didn't find anything.

50:39.166 --> 50:40.689
You what?

50:40.733 --> 50:42.169
You were like 16.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.346
I did what I had to do.

50:46.608 --> 50:48.349
Yeah.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.093
How about you?

50:53.137 --> 50:54.964
How are you doing?

50:55.008 --> 50:56.792
: It's a change of pace, huh?

50:58.838 --> 51:00.883
Just as I was remembering...

51:02.842 --> 51:04.844
who I was,

51:04.887 --> 51:06.933
everything changed.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.805
It slowed down.

51:10.806 --> 51:13.244
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

51:13.287 --> 51:16.986
It's like I... I need to face
the world head-on or something

51:17.030 --> 51:18.423
to feel alive.

51:19.424 --> 51:22.253
Seeing little Brian

51:22.296 --> 51:25.430
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company...

51:27.084 --> 51:28.737
that got to me.

51:30.217 --> 51:32.698
We never used to hide.

51:34.482 --> 51:37.920
Hey, dom's my brother, but you
will always be my sister.

51:38.921 --> 51:41.968
Funny how we all have secrets.

51:47.930 --> 51:49.889
What?

51:49.932 --> 51:52.239
You got to be kidding me.

51:52.283 --> 51:53.980
What is it?

51:54.023 --> 51:56.374
Remember what han used to say
about Tokyo?

51:59.159 --> 52:01.379
You mean how
in all the old westerns,

52:01.422 --> 52:03.357
cowboys would make a run
for the border to get away

52:03.381 --> 52:05.426
from the law,
how Tokyo was his...

52:05.470 --> 52:06.645
Mexico.

52:10.997 --> 52:12.651
No way.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.792
Die for my gang member

52:23.836 --> 52:26.665
dope man dope dealer

52:29.015 --> 52:30.669
she's ready to roll.

52:30.712 --> 52:32.845
No. No!

52:32.888 --> 52:34.238
No, Sean!

52:34.281 --> 52:35.891
Tell me you are not modding

52:35.935 --> 52:37.391
the quick disconnect valve
on the lox line.

52:37.415 --> 52:38.372
Hey, man, chill out.

52:38.416 --> 52:40.026
All right? It's all good.

52:40.069 --> 52:42.507
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good"?

52:42.550 --> 52:45.074
This isn't top gun, maverick.

52:45.118 --> 52:46.400
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

52:46.424 --> 52:48.600
Hey, come on. That's a bit much.

52:48.643 --> 52:50.819
When you know what too much
pressure in the lox line

52:50.863 --> 52:52.081
can do, come talk to me.

52:52.125 --> 52:53.387
Till then, stay in your Lane.

52:53.431 --> 52:55.215
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my Lane.

52:55.259 --> 52:57.261
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

52:57.304 --> 53:00.133
how to let us build
rocket engines and get paid.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.440
This whole thing was my idea.

53:02.483 --> 53:05.007
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

53:05.051 --> 53:07.358
this glorified mechanic...

53:07.401 --> 53:08.881
Or a rocket scientist?

53:08.924 --> 53:10.709
Without me, you'd be
working at jiffy lube.

53:10.752 --> 53:11.971
Guys, guys.

53:12.014 --> 53:13.059
Look, it's all good.

53:13.102 --> 53:14.365
Who cares about who did what?

53:14.408 --> 53:16.105
Kind of hard for you
to do anything

53:16.149 --> 53:17.822
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, twinkie.

53:17.846 --> 53:19.718
Did I hear that right?

53:19.761 --> 53:22.068
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

53:23.548 --> 53:25.463
"Twinkie"?

53:25.506 --> 53:29.162
So you must be
ding dong and snoball.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.382
- Right?
- Yo, uh...

53:31.425 --> 53:33.035
I don't go by that name anymore.

53:33.079 --> 53:35.560
You went by that name ever?

53:35.603 --> 53:36.909
Like, ever?

53:36.952 --> 53:38.389
: I... that's-that's-that's...

53:39.912 --> 53:42.306
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

53:44.046 --> 53:45.265
Hey, fellas.

53:45.309 --> 53:47.224
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

53:48.225 --> 53:51.880
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

53:58.931 --> 54:02.151
Is that a Pontiac fiero

54:02.195 --> 54:03.892
strapped to a rocket engine?

54:03.936 --> 54:05.894
Impressive, I know.

54:05.938 --> 54:06.982
No.

54:07.026 --> 54:08.854
No, that's not impressive.

54:10.638 --> 54:12.901
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

54:30.136 --> 54:31.180
Plane's taking off!

54:31.224 --> 54:32.747
Go, go, go, go!

54:49.111 --> 54:50.852
Yes!

54:52.245 --> 54:53.246
We did it!

54:59.905 --> 55:03.778
Uh... I'm confused.

55:03.822 --> 55:05.519
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

55:05.563 --> 55:07.434
It didn't explode.

55:07.478 --> 55:09.218
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

55:09.262 --> 55:11.003
She's still in one piece.

55:17.009 --> 55:18.619
You mean "pieces"?

55:18.663 --> 55:22.667
Hey, jiffy lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

55:24.408 --> 55:26.801
Look, we heard y'all could
get us some wheels.

55:26.845 --> 55:29.151
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

55:29.195 --> 55:30.936
Is that possible?

55:30.979 --> 55:33.895
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

55:33.939 --> 55:36.071
Dominic toretto sent us.

55:43.818 --> 55:45.733
Who's Dominic toretto?

56:35.435 --> 56:36.871
Hmm.

56:39.570 --> 56:41.572
Nice necklace, queenie.

56:42.877 --> 56:46.315
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

56:46.359 --> 56:48.405
Dominic toretto.

56:50.276 --> 56:53.061
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

56:53.105 --> 56:56.151
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

56:56.195 --> 56:58.327
When are they gonna learn?

56:58.371 --> 57:00.286
Some birds can't be caged.

57:00.329 --> 57:02.462
Are you looking for
one of me sons?

57:03.681 --> 57:06.118
Not tonight.

57:06.161 --> 57:08.642
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

57:12.690 --> 57:15.257
My thieving days are over.-

57:16.215 --> 57:17.651
mine ain't.

57:19.044 --> 57:20.872
You coming?

57:52.207 --> 57:53.992
I'm looking for someone.

57:54.035 --> 57:56.864
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

57:56.908 --> 57:59.824
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

57:59.867 --> 58:01.956
Oh, yeah, yeah,
word did go round

58:02.000 --> 58:04.742
on a crew that just turned up,
led by an American.

58:10.704 --> 58:13.011
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

58:13.054 --> 58:15.927
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

58:21.062 --> 58:23.325
Local seller, huh?

58:23.369 --> 58:25.806
She wouldn't happen to be
wearing a stolen necklace,

58:25.850 --> 58:27.112
- would she?
- He paid well.

58:27.155 --> 58:28.940
What was I supposed to do?

58:33.640 --> 58:35.599
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

58:35.642 --> 58:38.123
Similar features.

58:39.124 --> 58:41.866
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

58:41.909 --> 58:43.955
He's my brother.

58:47.741 --> 58:49.541
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

58:58.883 --> 59:01.668
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

59:03.714 --> 59:05.542
He offered payment
for something else.

59:08.109 --> 59:09.546
You.

59:30.305 --> 59:33.178
In your mouth

59:37.138 --> 59:38.923
you know,
nothing's more powerful

59:38.966 --> 59:40.751
than the love of family.

59:40.794 --> 59:44.276
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

59:44.319 --> 59:46.931
nothing's more dangerous.

59:52.153 --> 59:53.851
Dom?

59:53.894 --> 59:56.549
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

59:56.593 --> 59:58.290
You're my favorite American.

01:00:09.344 --> 01:00:12.696
Rio cuando lloras

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.393
la-la-la-la-la-

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:25.926
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, dom?

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.929
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:30.888
You know, best security, too.

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:33.673
I'm Otto.
I'm your brother's partner.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.245
Well, fi-financier.

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.073
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:44.031
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:45.163
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:46.643
Everything you see here, I own.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:48.470
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:49.863
maybe two, maybe three,

01:00:49.907 --> 01:00:51.691
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.302
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan,
too. Huh?

01:00:54.346 --> 01:00:55.782
Where is Jakob?

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:57.654
He's inside.

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:40.435
The brother
you're looking for...

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:42.133
He's from an old life.

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:46.050
- He's long gone.
- All I see is the same

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:48.400
scared little kid
that killed our father.

01:01:50.663 --> 01:01:52.534
That's your mistake.

01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:56.800
The spy game...

01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:58.540
This is my world.

01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:05.069
So here's my offer.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.985
It's the same one you gave me.

01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:12.554
You leave.

01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:14.556
Now.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.431
You drive away,
and you never come back.

01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:20.519
Ever.

01:02:20.562 --> 01:02:22.390
A deal?

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:25.437
I showed you mercy!

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.658
And I won't show it
to you again.

01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:40.757
Toretto.

01:02:42.454 --> 01:02:45.196
Since my dad is head of state,

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.459
it makes me a foreign dignitary

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:50.244
and this place an embassy.

01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:52.594
Which means you just trespassed

01:02:52.638 --> 01:02:54.379
into my country
and attempted murder.

01:02:54.422 --> 01:02:56.511
So, naturally, I called in
a little favor

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:58.687
with all my good friends
from Interpol.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:02.082
You keep digging around
in the past, dom,

01:03:02.126 --> 01:03:04.215
you're not gonna like
what you find.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.226
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:19.099
But your family is
a train wreck.

01:03:19.143 --> 01:03:22.363
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:24.409
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:28.674
Get the second piece, maybe
do a little sightseeing, huh?

01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.459
Any news on the key?

01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:33.548
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.598
One week from now, there won't
be a superpower in the world

01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:41.339
can take a piss
without our permission.

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:43.341
One week from now,
your dad will be asking you

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.430
for an allowance.-

01:03:45.473 --> 01:03:46.561
I'd like that.

01:03:48.259 --> 01:03:49.782
I'd like that.

01:04:02.186 --> 01:04:04.057
Whew.

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:06.364
What's up?

01:04:08.322 --> 01:04:10.977
- Well done, leysa.
- Please.

01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:14.024
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the d.R.

01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:16.069
So queenie treating you right?

01:04:16.113 --> 01:04:17.244
Like a princesa.

01:04:17.288 --> 01:04:18.637
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.552
Cara's little sister done good.

01:04:20.595 --> 01:04:21.988
Good?

01:04:22.032 --> 01:04:23.990
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

01:04:24.034 --> 01:04:25.774
You see how I been rocking shit?

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:28.473
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.083
I been around the world.

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:31.389
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:04:31.432 --> 01:04:33.304
You might need this.

01:04:33.347 --> 01:04:36.307
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:39.179
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

01:05:16.869 --> 01:05:18.305
Hey, letty.

01:05:19.524 --> 01:05:20.655
Yeah.

01:05:20.699 --> 01:05:22.919
Come look at this.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:24.224
What the hell?

01:05:24.268 --> 01:05:27.053
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.014
Letty, Mia!-

01:05:31.057 --> 01:05:32.102
down, now!

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.784
You okay?

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:34.849
Welcome to Saint giles'
cathedral of Edinburgh.

01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:39.550
The high kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:41.987
Renowned for
its stained glass windows,

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:44.946
you can see
the intricate craftsmanship...

01:08:47.993 --> 01:08:49.821
-We're a go.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.743
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:00.745
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

01:09:00.787 --> 01:09:02.225
and the algorithm I've run says.

01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:04.357
Jakob's team is
right on top of us.

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.751
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:09.448
80 meters?
That's a lot around here.

01:09:09.493 --> 01:09:12.234
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

01:09:12.278 --> 01:09:14.237
: So, we don't know

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:17.240
where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,

01:09:17.283 --> 01:09:18.502
now, do we?

01:09:18.545 --> 01:09:20.765
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

01:09:20.808 --> 01:09:22.375
: You know what?

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.638
I'm starting to think
your little English accent

01:09:24.682 --> 01:09:26.727
makes you sound smarter
than you are.

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:34.082
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned

01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:35.562
tracking chip would've put us

01:09:35.606 --> 01:09:37.173
within like
six feet of this dude?

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.392
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

01:09:39.435 --> 01:09:41.394
and facial recognition imaging.

01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:43.395
Feels like we looking
for where's Waldo

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.225
- in Harry Potter world.
- Yeah, uh,

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:49.010
strong argument there, tej, but
tracking chips follow the chip.

01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:51.099
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:53.493
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:56.017
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

01:09:57.628 --> 01:09:59.020
Wait.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:01.022
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.478
Cameras are going down
all around us,

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:05.157
and my equipment is
freaking out.

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:09.161
What the hell, Jimmy?-

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.207
security alert.
Cameras are down.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.080
Damn.

01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:16.734
You see anything suspicious?

01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:18.518
Uh, where do I start?

01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:22.043
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:24.263
I even seen
these two ladies walking

01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:27.527
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:30.574
I feel like I'm in transylvania
or some damn where.

01:10:43.064 --> 01:10:45.197
Ramsey,
we're looking everywhere.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.590
I just grew a new bunion.

01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:48.374
This is hopeless.

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:51.290
What?

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:53.466
- You see that?
- See what?

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:55.120
The ears.

01:10:55.163 --> 01:10:57.078
They got cauliflower ears.

01:10:57.122 --> 01:10:58.993
They fight for a living.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.867
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.304
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of crocs

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:08.786
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.400
Where are my shoes, man?!

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:19.449
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:23.975
Hey, dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.818
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.326
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

01:11:29.676 --> 01:11:31.156
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:33.550
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

01:11:34.507 --> 01:11:36.901
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:39.251
You know what?
Sh... just shut up.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.644
Just shut up.

01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:42.907
Ramsey, say we had
a big electromagnet

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.605
turned up right around here.

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:48.391
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

01:11:48.434 --> 01:11:50.349
Including security systems.
That's it.

01:11:50.393 --> 01:11:52.395
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

01:11:56.877 --> 01:11:58.009
Guys?

01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:00.054
Guys?

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:05.408
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:08.193
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:24.601
I got eyes on Jakob.

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:34.350
I see Otto.

01:12:36.395 --> 01:12:37.962
I'm gonna tail him.

01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:48.973
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:50.148
Okay, follow him.

01:12:50.191 --> 01:12:52.411
Me? I can't.

01:12:52.455 --> 01:12:53.717
Why not?

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.347
Okay, this is a bad time
to tell you this,

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.111
but I don't drive.

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:59.220
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

01:12:59.244 --> 01:13:01.464
And, you know, no one
really drives in London.

01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:04.075
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

01:13:04.118 --> 01:13:05.163
It's you or no one.

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:19.743
Shit.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:21.614
Guys, come on, man.

01:13:21.658 --> 01:13:23.050
I feel like,
between the six of us,

01:13:23.094 --> 01:13:25.183
we can work this out, right?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.541
Okay. I've got...

01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:44.376
Ramsey, shut it off!

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.682
Shut it off!

01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:48.206
Go, go, go!

01:13:48.249 --> 01:13:50.295
Okay. Uh...

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.558
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:56.823
Oh.

01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:49.833
-Shit.

01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:54.881
Hey!

01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:09.722
Oh! Sorry!

01:15:27.697 --> 01:15:29.481
Whoa!-

01:15:53.766 --> 01:15:55.812
Oh, no!-

01:15:57.683 --> 01:15:59.119
move!

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:00.947
Hey, that was not my fault!

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:11.697
Okay, that one was my fault.

01:16:45.688 --> 01:16:47.646
See?

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.692
What'd I tell you?

01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:51.084
Not even a scratch.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.101
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

01:17:15.369 --> 01:17:17.284
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.325
Otto, where are you?

01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:01.024
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:04.070
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:39.758
That's my car, pal!

01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.412
Dom!

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:47.853
Go!

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:52.423
Damn it.-

01:19:23.846 --> 01:19:25.064
You're a natural.

01:19:25.108 --> 01:19:27.763
Of course I am.

01:19:41.341 --> 01:19:42.734
Okay, listen up!

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:45.519
I want 50 of the best men!
I want guns!

01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:48.653
I want wheels, freaking
x-wing fighters... I don't care!

01:19:48.696 --> 01:19:49.959
The millennium falcon,

01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:51.699
Chewbacca if you can
get a hold of him.

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:54.050
Money's no object. Go.-

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:56.139
go!-

01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:07.193
What?

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:10.544
What's so funny?

01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:13.765
I...

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.855
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

01:20:16.899 --> 01:20:18.378
this would be the moment

01:20:18.422 --> 01:20:21.947
where the villain has
an unexpected setback,

01:20:21.991 --> 01:20:24.645
overcompensates without
thinking it through

01:20:24.689 --> 01:20:26.822
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

01:20:28.562 --> 01:20:32.958
No offense, but you have
no idea what we're about to do.

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:36.005
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

01:20:36.048 --> 01:20:38.529
Me? I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

01:20:38.572 --> 01:20:40.052
Are you sure about that?

01:20:40.096 --> 01:20:43.273
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

01:20:45.144 --> 01:20:47.146
Look at what you've built.

01:20:48.539 --> 01:20:50.497
Really? Luke?

01:20:51.672 --> 01:20:53.109
You're right.

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:55.415
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

01:20:56.416 --> 01:20:57.853
No.

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:01.334
You're Yoda.

01:21:01.378 --> 01:21:03.249
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:04.685
No. The little green guy?

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:06.426
- Yeah.
- No.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.256
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.171
Because he's
a powerful jedi, right?

01:21:12.215 --> 01:21:14.391
No.

01:21:14.434 --> 01:21:15.914
Yoda's a puppet.

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:21.137
With someone's hand up his ass.

01:21:44.377 --> 01:21:46.336
So what now, dom?

01:21:46.379 --> 01:21:49.774
No one outruns their past.

01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:51.645
And yours just caught up to you.

01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:02.308
Man.

01:22:02.352 --> 01:22:04.180
There is
literally zero industrial

01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:06.269
or weapons-grade electromagnets
I can find

01:22:06.312 --> 01:22:07.835
that are this powerful.

01:22:07.879 --> 01:22:09.291
Look at the pull strength
level here.

01:22:09.315 --> 01:22:11.404
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

01:22:11.448 --> 01:22:13.450
: Wait, watch this.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.121
:
Every time. I can't believe it.

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:33.992
What are you doing, bruh?

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.385
I'm hungry.

01:22:35.428 --> 01:22:37.343
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

01:22:37.387 --> 01:22:38.866
Surprise.

01:22:42.435 --> 01:22:44.655
Nice clubhouse.

01:22:55.057 --> 01:22:56.710
'Sup, man?

01:23:01.237 --> 01:23:02.586
Nice to meet you.

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.518
So you got my postcard, huh?

01:23:38.361 --> 01:23:41.842
I'm just still
trying to figure out...

01:23:41.886 --> 01:23:43.931
How are you still alive?

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:49.589
Well, after Gisele died...

01:23:49.633 --> 01:23:51.678
I didn't know what to do.

01:23:52.679 --> 01:23:54.029
I was aimless.

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.336
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.860
But can you get
to the part where

01:23:59.904 --> 01:24:02.385
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

01:24:02.428 --> 01:24:04.300
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:06.258
Can you just be quiet
for one minute?

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:08.347
We made plans.

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:11.133
We had dreams.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.874
So what's our next adventure
after this?

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:19.576
How about...
We stay in one place?

01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:23.232
- Where you thinking?
- Tokyo.

01:24:23.275 --> 01:24:26.017
We always talk about Tokyo.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.627
Tokyo it is.

01:24:28.889 --> 01:24:31.718
You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,

01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:34.678
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.638
But it became home.

01:24:40.162 --> 01:24:42.729
Then one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:44.731
I worked with Gisele.

01:24:44.775 --> 01:24:46.733
Back when I was a CIA operative

01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:49.867
running the drug trade
in Central America.

01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:52.783
The good old days.

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:55.307
Gisele was my best.

01:24:55.351 --> 01:24:57.396
You can lose an asset
at any time.

01:24:59.355 --> 01:25:02.880
Bullet, knife, wire.

01:25:02.923 --> 01:25:05.883
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

01:25:05.926 --> 01:25:07.363
To love.

01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:11.845
What do you want?

01:25:11.889 --> 01:25:15.153
I'm offering you a job, han.

01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:17.286
Here, in Tokyo.

01:25:17.329 --> 01:25:18.852
Why me?

01:25:18.896 --> 01:25:21.072
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.553
I saw that she trusted you.

01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:27.948
And that means I can trust you.

01:25:27.992 --> 01:25:32.866
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:40.396
And all I knew
was that I had to steal

01:25:40.439 --> 01:25:43.181
some tech from the home
of a scientist couple.

01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:49.579
But as usual...

01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:51.885
Mr. Nobody didn't
tell me everything.

01:25:53.452 --> 01:25:55.889
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:02.635
I was 11.

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:05.595
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

01:26:05.638 --> 01:26:07.988
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:11.644
I was so excited to go

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:15.344
I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.

01:26:22.046 --> 01:26:24.091
At first, I didn't see it.

01:26:26.268 --> 01:26:28.313
By the time
I looked out the window...

01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:33.492
Mom and dad were gone.

01:26:33.536 --> 01:26:35.364
Turns out I wasn't the only one

01:26:35.407 --> 01:26:36.887
looking for this thing.-

01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:05.263
Get down!

01:27:14.707 --> 01:27:16.143
Han saved me.

01:27:16.187 --> 01:27:18.755
Wouldn't leave me behind.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:23.238
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

01:27:25.979 --> 01:27:27.851
We became a family.

01:27:30.027 --> 01:27:32.247
"Always be a target"?

01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:35.641
Why?

01:27:35.685 --> 01:27:37.513
'Cause she is the key.

01:27:42.039 --> 01:27:45.260
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

01:27:45.303 --> 01:27:47.566
It was a person all along.

01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:49.351
My parents didn't want

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:52.049
project aries to fall
into the wrong hands,

01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:55.487
so they locked it with their
own DNA, something we share.

01:27:56.706 --> 01:27:59.099
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

01:27:59.143 --> 01:28:02.668
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

01:28:02.712 --> 01:28:04.583
So when deckard Shaw
came calling,

01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:06.063
we used it as cover.

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:15.115
But you got killed
in a car crash, han.

01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.294
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

01:28:27.214 --> 01:28:29.869
Pretty nifty magic trick.

01:28:29.913 --> 01:28:31.958
Yeah, I've done better.

01:28:33.873 --> 01:28:35.919
Now for the hard part.

01:28:38.008 --> 01:28:39.662
Keeping you dead.

01:28:42.055 --> 01:28:43.666
My death...

01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:45.450
Became the best way
to stay alive.

01:28:51.282 --> 01:28:52.564
- What's happening?
- It's some kind of

01:28:52.588 --> 01:28:54.285
hidden subroutine
the system follows.

01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:20.267
That's it, right there.

01:29:20.311 --> 01:29:22.922
Yeah, nobody moves...

01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:24.924
Everybody lives.

01:29:29.799 --> 01:29:31.061
Jakob.

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:34.456
I'm sorry, Mia.

01:29:38.416 --> 01:29:40.418
I was the rogue agent.

01:29:40.462 --> 01:29:41.506
Me.

01:29:42.986 --> 01:29:45.380
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:47.947
Think he just dropped
out of the sky and chose you?

01:29:47.991 --> 01:29:52.082
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:57.522
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, dom.

01:29:58.784 --> 01:30:00.395
And you just handed her over.

01:30:01.744 --> 01:30:03.180
I told you.

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:05.878
This is my world.

01:30:06.879 --> 01:30:09.229
Got it.-

01:30:09.273 --> 01:30:11.014
got a lot of guys here.

01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:13.190
You trust 'em?

01:30:13.233 --> 01:30:14.321
Trust this.

01:30:19.936 --> 01:30:22.199
You know the only good thing
to come from dad dying?

01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:28.727
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

01:30:31.817 --> 01:30:35.865
And now you're gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine.

01:30:39.521 --> 01:30:43.089
Only good thing
about dad dying...

01:30:43.133 --> 01:30:45.483
Was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

01:30:46.528 --> 01:30:48.834
You never deserved
the toretto name.

01:30:51.228 --> 01:30:52.882
You think you knew dad, huh?

01:30:52.925 --> 01:30:55.125
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

01:30:55.885 --> 01:30:57.495
Okay?

01:30:57.539 --> 01:30:59.454
You want the truth?

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:05.198
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

01:31:06.199 --> 01:31:08.288
We were in deep debt.

01:31:08.332 --> 01:31:11.074
'Cause of how he felt about you,

01:31:11.117 --> 01:31:13.076
he had to ask me for help.

01:31:13.119 --> 01:31:15.774
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:18.951
A good son would've said no.

01:31:19.996 --> 01:31:22.564
And a real brother
would've come to me.

01:31:22.607 --> 01:31:24.304
Come to you?

01:31:29.179 --> 01:31:31.660
He made me promise
you would never find out.

01:31:32.878 --> 01:31:35.402
And through all of it...

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:37.883
I kept that promise.

01:31:45.282 --> 01:31:46.979
The girl comes with me.

01:31:47.023 --> 01:31:48.067
Jakob!

01:31:51.331 --> 01:31:53.812
I will stop you.

01:31:53.856 --> 01:31:55.510
And that's my promise.

01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:01.254
Hey!

01:32:06.042 --> 01:32:08.435
Sue. Sue. Ah.-

01:32:08.479 --> 01:32:09.741
come on. Come on.

01:32:38.204 --> 01:32:39.379
-Down!

01:32:49.302 --> 01:32:50.434
Go! Go!

01:32:50.477 --> 01:32:51.653
Come on!

01:33:02.402 --> 01:33:03.578
This way!

01:33:24.033 --> 01:33:26.078
I'm always here.

01:33:26.122 --> 01:33:27.253
Tell him.

01:33:29.168 --> 01:33:32.476
No...!

01:33:32.519 --> 01:33:34.391
No!

01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:50.075
No!

01:35:09.181 --> 01:35:10.922
Dom.

01:35:10.966 --> 01:35:13.011
Tell me what you see, son.

01:35:20.497 --> 01:35:23.152
See, cars like this
are immortal.

01:35:28.766 --> 01:35:31.595
'70 chargers are
designed so well

01:35:31.638 --> 01:35:36.034
that if you take care of 'em,
they'll run for 100 years.

01:35:36.078 --> 01:35:37.557
Immortal?

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.736
Just like a family, dom.

01:35:43.259 --> 01:35:45.914
Build it right,
you take care of it...

01:35:47.393 --> 01:35:48.786
it'll live beyond you.

01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:50.832
Daddy.

01:35:58.883 --> 01:36:00.276
Little b.

01:36:00.319 --> 01:36:02.539
When are you coming home?

01:36:02.582 --> 01:36:04.410
Com...

01:36:22.428 --> 01:36:25.605
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:10.104
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

01:37:10.128 --> 01:37:11.651
- Last two laps.
- On it!

01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:13.740
Get those plug wires!

01:37:14.916 --> 01:37:17.832
Jakob! Now.

01:37:41.986 --> 01:37:43.945
-You're good!

01:38:00.962 --> 01:38:04.052
No!

01:38:49.314 --> 01:38:51.490
You came to me, letty.

01:38:51.534 --> 01:38:56.539
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

01:38:56.582 --> 01:38:58.933
: Do you hear me?

01:39:00.717 --> 01:39:02.937
Is this who we are?

01:39:08.072 --> 01:39:09.856
: Yeah.

01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:16.254
From here, things move quickly.

01:39:16.298 --> 01:39:17.864
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

01:39:17.908 --> 01:39:19.431
Once he activates aries,

01:39:19.475 --> 01:39:21.148
all he needs to do is
send the signal global.

01:39:21.172 --> 01:39:23.000
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

01:39:23.044 --> 01:39:25.437
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

01:39:25.481 --> 01:39:27.570
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

01:39:27.613 --> 01:39:30.007
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

01:39:30.051 --> 01:39:32.749
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

01:39:32.792 --> 01:39:34.446
Our odds are zero here, han.

01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:36.405
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

01:39:36.448 --> 01:39:38.122
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

01:39:38.146 --> 01:39:39.843
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

01:39:39.886 --> 01:39:41.714
Jakob on the ground...

01:39:41.758 --> 01:39:43.412
With his own private army.

01:39:43.455 --> 01:39:45.457
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:47.218
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically,

01:39:47.242 --> 01:39:50.636
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit.

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.508
Orbit?

01:39:52.551 --> 01:39:53.988
We need help.

01:39:54.031 --> 01:39:55.815
Otherwise, we have no chance.

01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:58.122
We do it ourselves.

01:39:59.123 --> 01:40:02.170
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

01:40:02.213 --> 01:40:04.215
No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:40:04.259 --> 01:40:06.652
Do y'all not understand?

01:40:06.696 --> 01:40:08.350
Clearly, y'all don't.

01:40:08.393 --> 01:40:11.440
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

01:40:11.483 --> 01:40:12.615
like a normal person.

01:40:12.658 --> 01:40:13.920
Orbit.

01:40:13.964 --> 01:40:15.748
That's outer space.

01:40:15.792 --> 01:40:18.142
That's another level.

01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:21.232
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

01:40:21.276 --> 01:40:22.625
Put rockets on our backs?

01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:26.411
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

01:40:26.455 --> 01:40:28.022
What?

01:40:42.514 --> 01:40:44.473
There goes my father's
diplomatic ties

01:40:44.516 --> 01:40:45.822
with Eastern Europe.

01:40:45.865 --> 01:40:47.104
This place is
going to be crawling

01:40:47.128 --> 01:40:49.086
with every cop in the city.

01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:51.175
Time to get the hell
out of here.

01:41:11.543 --> 01:41:12.805
Keep her close.

01:41:23.555 --> 01:41:25.731
It's activated.

01:41:28.908 --> 01:41:30.475
As soon as the satellite
reaches orbit,

01:41:30.519 --> 01:41:32.695
we start the uplink.

01:41:35.524 --> 01:41:38.092
Ah, damn.

01:41:38.135 --> 01:41:40.268
What?

01:41:40.311 --> 01:41:42.052
You see that?

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:44.576
We can't have an air leak, man.

01:41:47.275 --> 01:41:49.973
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

01:41:50.016 --> 01:41:51.279
Yes.

01:41:51.322 --> 01:41:52.932
I don't know
if you noticed or not,

01:41:52.976 --> 01:41:55.326
but this whole operation is
band-aids and duct tape.

01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:57.372
Man, this is insane.

01:41:57.415 --> 01:41:59.852
We are headed to outer space.-

01:41:59.896 --> 01:42:02.507
you acting like
we on our way to home depot.

01:42:02.551 --> 01:42:03.900
This is ridiculous, man.

01:42:03.943 --> 01:42:05.554
I'm about to abort
this whole mission

01:42:05.597 --> 01:42:07.860
and take my black ass home.

01:42:07.904 --> 01:42:10.428
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

01:42:10.472 --> 01:42:11.429
Freefall?

01:42:11.473 --> 01:42:12.996
What does that even mean?

01:42:13.039 --> 01:42:15.825
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

01:42:15.868 --> 01:42:17.783
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

01:42:17.827 --> 01:42:20.438
then we'll be fine, okay?

01:42:20.482 --> 01:42:22.440
It's just all math and science.

01:42:22.484 --> 01:42:24.486
I knew I should've listened
to my teachers.

01:42:24.529 --> 01:42:25.922
: Four minutes to launch.

01:42:25.965 --> 01:42:27.576
You fellas good to go?

01:42:28.794 --> 01:42:31.536
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.886
You know, that's what tej do.

01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:36.759
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

01:42:36.802 --> 01:42:39.370
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

01:42:39.414 --> 01:42:42.025
This is the same car
that we watched

01:42:42.068 --> 01:42:43.679
do a test run and explode.

01:42:43.722 --> 01:42:46.160
- This is not smart, tej.
- Don't worry, man.

01:42:46.203 --> 01:42:48.814
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

01:42:48.858 --> 01:42:51.295
You're 100% fireproof.

01:42:52.122 --> 01:42:53.210
Exactly.

01:42:53.254 --> 01:42:54.951
All eight thrusters

01:42:54.994 --> 01:42:56.344
fully functional.

01:42:59.390 --> 01:43:00.913
Hey, please don't tell me

01:43:00.957 --> 01:43:02.915
you're still running
launch simulations.

01:43:02.959 --> 01:43:05.135
Virgin galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:07.920
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

01:43:07.964 --> 01:43:09.487
Our last test run
with this load means

01:43:09.531 --> 01:43:10.856
we'll have to go higher...
Way higher!

01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.403
If we don't get them
high enough,

01:43:12.447 --> 01:43:14.318
these guys are gonna be
pancakes at ihop

01:43:14.362 --> 01:43:15.774
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

01:43:15.798 --> 01:43:16.973
Hey!

01:43:17.016 --> 01:43:18.279
We can still hear you!

01:43:18.322 --> 01:43:20.672
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

01:43:20.716 --> 01:43:22.457
We do got this, right?

01:43:52.443 --> 01:43:54.793
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

01:43:54.837 --> 01:43:56.404
And I've got a lock
on the aries signal.

01:43:56.447 --> 01:43:57.847
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

01:43:57.883 --> 01:43:59.339
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

01:43:59.363 --> 01:44:00.862
by the time Roman and tej
are in position.

01:44:00.886 --> 01:44:03.324
Ramsey, power us up.

01:44:06.675 --> 01:44:09.155
Satellite is in low orbit.

01:44:10.766 --> 01:44:11.941
Begin.

01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:30.176
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.222
Time to get ready, boys.

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:33.876
What we supposed to be doing

01:44:33.919 --> 01:44:36.400
with these old-ass suits

01:44:36.444 --> 01:44:38.141
that ain't been used
since world war I?

01:44:38.184 --> 01:44:39.751
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:42.798
Astronauts "r" us was closed
for shopping today.

01:44:42.841 --> 01:44:45.583
Listen, these suits are
just like space suits.

01:44:45.627 --> 01:44:47.498
They both account
for pressure differential.

01:44:47.542 --> 01:44:49.108
Only thing is we may

01:44:49.152 --> 01:44:51.197
blow up like balloons
just a little bit.

01:44:51.241 --> 01:44:52.523
- That's the only difference.
- What?

01:44:52.547 --> 01:44:54.200
We just hit the launch altitude.

01:44:54.244 --> 01:44:56.377
- You guys ready for a five count?
- No, man!

01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.858
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

01:44:59.902 --> 01:45:01.382
Don't listen to him. We ready!

01:45:01.425 --> 01:45:02.818
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

01:45:02.861 --> 01:45:04.472
I thought you was invincible.

01:45:04.515 --> 01:45:06.952
Let's see how invincible
your black ass is after this.

01:45:06.996 --> 01:45:08.650
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

01:45:12.088 --> 01:45:14.656
Oh, my god! I don't want to die!

01:45:14.699 --> 01:45:16.353
Ignition!

01:46:00.528 --> 01:46:03.879
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

01:46:07.578 --> 01:46:09.363
We're in outer space!

01:46:10.451 --> 01:46:13.584
Told you numbers don't lie.

01:46:13.628 --> 01:46:15.673
This is crazy, bro!

01:46:26.771 --> 01:46:28.947
Man, how much candy did you eat?

01:46:28.991 --> 01:46:31.733
Well, i-i... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

01:46:41.395 --> 01:46:43.397
I thought you said
you took care of this.

01:46:44.963 --> 01:46:46.965
Yeah. Hey.

01:46:47.009 --> 01:46:50.186
You take them back to the
freaking junkyard right now!

01:48:25.586 --> 01:48:27.196
All right, han, Mia, you're up!

01:48:40.644 --> 01:48:42.080
Now.

01:48:47.738 --> 01:48:49.523
Letty.

01:49:09.194 --> 01:49:10.544
Han!

01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:10.342
Not all of us.

01:50:24.052 --> 01:50:27.185
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:29.013
There.

01:50:29.057 --> 01:50:30.362
Right there. You see it?

01:50:30.406 --> 01:50:31.842
Got it.

01:50:31.886 --> 01:50:34.192
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

01:50:34.236 --> 01:50:37.631
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

01:50:38.675 --> 01:50:40.677
Driving is what I do.

01:50:47.641 --> 01:50:50.818
Two dudes from the ghetto...
Outer space.

01:50:52.863 --> 01:50:54.822
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

01:50:54.865 --> 01:50:57.172
You're right.

01:51:05.354 --> 01:51:07.269
Something's wrong with
the satellite array.

01:51:07.312 --> 01:51:09.750
It's, uh, interfering
with the uplink.

01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:14.102
I'll handle it.

01:51:32.033 --> 01:51:33.077
Han?

01:51:34.339 --> 01:51:36.298
Grab the wheel.

01:51:36.341 --> 01:51:37.691
Something's up.

01:51:39.388 --> 01:51:41.607
I think I can link
into their feed.

01:51:53.794 --> 01:51:56.231
- Something you want to tell me, Otto?
- My bad.

01:51:56.274 --> 01:51:59.234
Satellite uplink is
actually going splendid.

01:51:59.277 --> 01:52:01.932
Oh, and by the way,
I have a new business partner.

01:52:01.976 --> 01:52:03.978
Maybe you know her.

01:52:04.021 --> 01:52:06.850
Guess who's
out of the box, Jakob.

01:52:06.894 --> 01:52:08.939
But I did try to warn you.

01:52:11.463 --> 01:52:13.639
You were never my competition.

01:52:13.683 --> 01:52:16.512
- Otto, there's something you should know.
- Yeah, go on.

01:52:16.555 --> 01:52:18.688
- Lay it on me, dude.
- You're a spoiled rich prick,

01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:21.343
- and I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.

01:52:21.386 --> 01:52:23.127
No one told you, huh?

01:52:23.171 --> 01:52:27.175
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

01:53:50.345 --> 01:53:53.348
Come on. Come on!

01:54:11.932 --> 01:54:13.150
Go.

01:54:52.886 --> 01:54:54.931
- What's happening?
- Uh, well,

01:54:54.975 --> 01:54:58.369
we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

01:54:58.413 --> 01:55:00.023
And, well, dom is making things

01:55:00.067 --> 01:55:01.807
a little bit difficult here,
but it's fine.

01:55:01.851 --> 01:55:03.809
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

01:55:03.853 --> 01:55:05.376
I'll finish this myself.

01:55:09.598 --> 01:55:12.470
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

01:55:12.514 --> 01:55:13.776
You ready, Elle?

01:55:27.007 --> 01:55:28.834
Crank it.

01:55:28.878 --> 01:55:30.924
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

01:56:01.911 --> 01:56:04.174
Guys, that thing is
not slowing down

01:56:04.218 --> 01:56:05.871
and the download's almost done.

01:56:05.915 --> 01:56:09.049
Dom, we don't get
out of here now, we're dead.

01:56:18.319 --> 01:56:20.408
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

01:56:20.451 --> 01:56:22.018
What?

01:56:22.062 --> 01:56:23.735
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

01:56:23.759 --> 01:56:25.979
we flip it
and we hit the underside.

01:56:26.022 --> 01:56:28.720
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

01:56:28.764 --> 01:56:30.374
Flatten these clowns!

01:56:48.914 --> 01:56:50.699
- Letty, the wires.
- You read my mind.

01:56:50.742 --> 01:56:52.396
Han, get in front of me.

01:56:54.398 --> 01:56:56.531
Dom, I can't get to you.

01:56:57.532 --> 01:56:59.012
But I can.

01:58:14.348 --> 01:58:16.654
All right,
the satellite is in range.

01:58:16.698 --> 01:58:18.439
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

01:58:18.482 --> 01:58:20.005
All right, take our time.

01:58:30.407 --> 01:58:31.974
Okay. All right.

01:58:33.584 --> 01:58:36.326
- Tej!
- Hold on. Come on, baby.

01:58:36.370 --> 01:58:38.067
Power up. Power up.

01:58:40.896 --> 01:58:42.027
Shit.-

01:58:42.071 --> 01:58:44.465
- shit, shit, shit.
- What?

01:58:44.508 --> 01:58:46.293
Talk to me. What's going on?

01:58:46.336 --> 01:58:48.358
The pressure of the launch...
It must have jammed the cables

01:58:48.382 --> 01:58:50.079
to the power source.

01:58:50.123 --> 01:58:53.169
Damn it, how did I
not think of that?

01:58:53.213 --> 01:58:55.171
Guys, where are you?

01:58:55.215 --> 01:58:58.566
The upload is almost complete.

01:58:58.609 --> 01:59:01.395
Why don't you just kill it?

01:59:01.438 --> 01:59:03.527
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

01:59:03.571 --> 01:59:07.575
No. If we crash into that
satellite, we'll probably die.

01:59:07.618 --> 01:59:09.098
And even if we don't,

01:59:09.142 --> 01:59:11.100
the fuel that it would take
to smash it...

01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:13.407
We'd be stuck out here forever.

01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:15.017
You got to have faith, bro.

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:17.759
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

01:59:17.802 --> 01:59:19.500
You know what, tej?

01:59:20.805 --> 01:59:22.416
You're probably right.

01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.507
We're not invincible.

01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:32.600
We probably just been lucky
this whole time.

01:59:38.388 --> 01:59:40.303
This might be it.

01:59:42.958 --> 01:59:45.613
But you know what?

01:59:45.656 --> 01:59:47.180
If we're gonna go out...

01:59:49.138 --> 01:59:51.271
let's go out
on top of the world.

01:59:52.315 --> 01:59:54.535
Guys, what's happening up there?

01:59:54.578 --> 01:59:56.624
We've got seconds left.

01:59:58.452 --> 02:00:00.323
Let's do it.

02:00:00.367 --> 02:00:01.411
Let's go.

02:00:06.286 --> 02:00:09.289
Five, four, three,

02:00:09.332 --> 02:00:11.421
two, one.

02:00:29.657 --> 02:00:31.528
We did it.

02:00:31.572 --> 02:00:33.226
-We did it!

02:00:33.269 --> 02:00:35.010
Let's go.

02:00:36.533 --> 02:00:38.535
-Shit.

02:00:38.579 --> 02:00:40.015
Not bad, man.

02:00:40.058 --> 02:00:41.538
Not bad at all.

02:00:53.333 --> 02:00:55.770
Hold on!-

02:01:03.256 --> 02:01:04.257
Dom!

02:02:04.795 --> 02:02:06.536
Got to be kidding me.

02:02:41.397 --> 02:02:43.094
-Shit!

02:03:35.495 --> 02:03:37.497
Think these belong to you.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:50.031
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

02:03:50.074 --> 02:03:52.294
Yeah.

02:03:52.337 --> 02:03:54.035
This is the world I chose, dom.

02:03:55.906 --> 02:03:59.040
You know, dad wasn't perfect.

02:03:59.083 --> 02:04:01.521
And he loved us all the same.

02:04:04.915 --> 02:04:08.658
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car...

02:04:08.702 --> 02:04:10.660
As a second chance.

02:04:12.401 --> 02:04:14.621
I owe you that, little brother.

02:04:27.938 --> 02:04:30.506
I lost you once.

02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:32.421
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

02:05:13.506 --> 02:05:16.030
-We come in peace!

02:05:16.073 --> 02:05:17.814
Hey!

02:05:46.103 --> 02:05:48.758
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

02:05:50.891 --> 02:05:52.414
This is where he raced.

02:05:52.457 --> 02:05:54.895
Did you race here, too, daddy?

02:05:54.938 --> 02:05:56.113
No.

02:05:56.157 --> 02:05:58.202
But I'll tell you something.

02:06:00.378 --> 02:06:02.380
Everything I needed
to know about life,

02:06:02.424 --> 02:06:03.904
I learned on this track.

02:06:03.947 --> 02:06:05.296
You did?

02:06:06.297 --> 02:06:07.908
I did.

02:06:50.428 --> 02:06:53.388
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

02:06:57.087 --> 02:06:59.133
We got some rough times ahead...

02:07:01.439 --> 02:07:03.485
but it's gonna be okay.

02:07:05.574 --> 02:07:07.358
'Cause we're family.

02:07:28.641 --> 02:07:32.732
Y haz lo rápido...

02:07:32.775 --> 02:07:34.951
- Fellas.
- Hey.

02:07:36.736 --> 02:07:39.869
Pero rápido...

02:07:39.913 --> 02:07:41.828
What?

02:07:41.871 --> 02:07:44.395
No way.

02:07:55.145 --> 02:07:57.191
: What's going on?

02:07:58.496 --> 02:08:01.543
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

02:08:05.982 --> 02:08:07.810
It's a long story.

02:08:09.159 --> 02:08:11.684
But for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

02:08:11.727 --> 02:08:13.381
Guys, this is Elle.

02:08:13.424 --> 02:08:15.600
-Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

02:08:15.644 --> 02:08:17.428
Just call me t.

02:08:17.472 --> 02:08:19.169
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

02:08:20.170 --> 02:08:21.868
Mia.

02:08:25.785 --> 02:08:27.787
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

02:08:36.926 --> 02:08:39.450
- Mm.
- Hey.

02:08:39.494 --> 02:08:41.583
How much longer on this food?

02:08:41.626 --> 02:08:44.238
Like, I'm-i'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

02:08:44.281 --> 02:08:46.762
I've been eating space food
for weeks.

02:08:46.806 --> 02:08:50.113
Oh. So tootsie rolls
are space food?

02:08:50.157 --> 02:08:51.375
'Cause that's all you ate.

02:08:51.419 --> 02:08:53.073
It was fat free, bruh.

02:08:53.116 --> 02:08:54.639
Snickers and Twix fat free, too?

02:08:54.683 --> 02:08:56.424
- My forehead hungry.
- Yeah, okay.

02:08:56.467 --> 02:08:58.787
- I'll see you later.
- Tej: Y-your forehead is overweight.

02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:00.689
Oh!

02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:04.519
You drive just like your dad.

02:09:04.562 --> 02:09:07.565
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

02:09:07.609 --> 02:09:09.698
Do you know, this is...

02:09:09.742 --> 02:09:12.092
This is where I met your mom
for the first time.

02:09:12.135 --> 02:09:13.833
Right there.

02:09:13.876 --> 02:09:16.139
She's watching over you
from heaven.

02:09:16.183 --> 02:09:18.228
- She is?
- Mm-hmm.

02:09:21.144 --> 02:09:23.538
I think daddy has
a question for you.

02:09:27.934 --> 02:09:30.023
You ready to say grace, kid?

02:09:30.066 --> 02:09:31.981
But I don't know what to say.

02:09:32.982 --> 02:09:34.375
Oh, it's easy.

02:09:35.724 --> 02:09:37.813
Just say whatever's
in your heart.

02:09:37.857 --> 02:09:38.858
: You ready?

02:09:38.901 --> 02:09:39.989
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

02:09:47.127 --> 02:09:48.476
Hey, guys.

02:09:48.519 --> 02:09:50.826
Hey.

02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:52.828
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

02:09:52.872 --> 02:09:55.178
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.-

02:09:55.222 --> 02:09:57.441
now, hold on.

02:09:57.485 --> 02:09:59.139
There's still an empty chair.

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:01.402
He's on the way.

02:10:33.913 --> 02:10:36.785
Through the fast Lane

02:10:36.829 --> 02:10:39.744

and make the wheels go up

02:10:59.503 --> 02:11:00.983

02:11:01.027 --> 02:11:03.681

02:11:09.122 --> 02:11:12.038
and a lambo on two necklaces

02:11:12.081 --> 02:11:14.518
I'm too reckless

02:11:14.562 --> 02:11:17.086

02:11:17.130 --> 02:11:19.567

02:11:33.363 --> 02:11:35.975

02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.224
and make the wheels go up

02:12:09.704 --> 02:12:11.184

02:12:13.838 --> 02:12:16.537

02:13:07.718 --> 02:13:09.111
You mean this drive?

02:13:13.420 --> 02:13:15.248

02:18:06.755 --> 02:18:08.932
Ni me pelas El día

02:18:10.673 --> 02:18:12.370
para la portería
