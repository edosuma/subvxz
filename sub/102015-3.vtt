WEBVTT

00:14.223 --> 00:15.224
Spit.

00:17.643 --> 00:21.438
When the devil comes into your life,
do you recognize him?

00:21.522 --> 00:28.320
Because he comes to us in many disguises.
He is the wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.616
He may appear to you as an angel of light,

00:33.242 --> 00:38.038
or perhaps he masquerades
in the shape of a woman.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.458
Indeed, the devil's
greatest trick of all...

00:41.542 --> 00:42.960
Don't give the minister the finger.

00:43.043 --> 00:47.089
...may be to persuade you
that he doesn't exist.

00:51.635 --> 00:52.636
Jesus.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.473
That sermon was kind of sexist,
don't you think?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.767
No. I thought it was
a real wake-up call.

00:58.851 --> 01:02.896
Yeah. Women possess black magic,
and it needs to be controlled.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.233
-Ship.
-Yeah?

01:07.276 --> 01:09.069
I don't think I'm the right girl for you.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.696
Of course you are.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.197
You're nothing like Lola.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.449
Who's Lola?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.161
Just a girl I knew in Nevada.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.539
Lola Montez.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.709
Lola Montez?

01:23.792 --> 01:27.629
She was a dancer.
An actress. An adventuress.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.340
One time, she shot me with a gun.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.510
Whoa. She sounds awesome.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.305
No. She was the devil.
She couldn't be trusted.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.391
She was nothing like you.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.935
You're prim, proper, obedient.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.605
I think I need some space.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.900
Sue! Sue, wait.

01:47.983 --> 01:48.984
What is it?

01:50.194 --> 01:52.738
I went on a walk the other night with Sam.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.781
I know. He told me.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.868
He did? What did he say?

01:58.368 --> 02:02.831
He said that you're a brilliant poet,
and he wants to publish you.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.541
Oh, I was afraid of him saying that.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.792
Why are you afraid?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.544
Emily, this is an incredible opportunity.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.716
A man like Sam Bowles has the power
to completely change your life.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.093
You should give him your poems now.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.345
I'm scared.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.722
-What are you scared of?
-Getting published.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.308
Why? Isn't that your greatest dream?

02:21.808 --> 02:25.562
Imagine how good it would feel
to be recognized.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.647
I just...

02:28.148 --> 02:29.274
need a little time.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.734
You don't have time.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.861
Sam isn't going to
stay focused on you for long.

02:32.945 --> 02:36.031
He's got a million things on his mind.
His attention span is short.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.660
-Can I at least talk it over with you?
-I've already told you what I think.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.579
I don't have time
to go down a rabbit hole with you.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.664
I have to go get ready.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.458
I promised I'd make a quick appearance
at a ball tonight in Concord,

02:46.542 --> 02:48.001
and I don't wanna flake.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.507
Hey. Are you okay?

02:55.759 --> 02:58.095
No. I need help.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.639
Me too.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.474
Like...

03:03.350 --> 03:04.643
spiritual help.

03:06.478 --> 03:07.479
Same.

03:10.774 --> 03:11.942
Let's have a séance.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.835
Oh, deary.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.463
Thirty-two lost in a shipwreck
off the coast of Norway.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.632
That's a lot of fish food.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.760
How terrible. Let me see.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.310
That's just awful news.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.270
Sometimes I wish
we didn't even get the newspaper

03:48.353 --> 03:51.940
so we wouldn't have to read about
every last shipwreck that happens in the--

03:52.024 --> 03:54.526
Oh. Look at the captain.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.694
Quite a looker, isn't he?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.738
"Captain Thomas Taylor."

03:58.363 --> 04:00.240
My goodness, he is strapping.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.534
That jawline could cut celery.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.786
Celery's a luxury now, you know.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.625
Are you all right, madam?

04:10.584 --> 04:13.879
Yes. I just had an odd sort of twinge.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.380
Sadness, I suppose.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.925
Such a tragic loss.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.384
Maybe he's not dead.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.720
What do you mean?
The ship sank in the storm.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.640
Aye, but his body has not been found.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.850
You know, one time in Ireland,

04:26.934 --> 04:30.812
a drowning seaman
telepathically transmitted his coordinates

04:30.896 --> 04:32.523
to a housewife in Kilkenny.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.982
Got a psychic message, she did,

04:34.066 --> 04:37.277
and don't you know,
she saved the entire crew.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.321
That sounds like Irish nonsense.

04:39.404 --> 04:43.033
Maybe so,
but I'd keep my mind open for a message.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.618
You could be saving a life.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.495
Want me to scrub your back?

04:46.578 --> 04:47.579
Mom?

04:47.663 --> 04:50.040
Mom, we need to use the parlor tonight.
It's an emergency.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.124
What do you need it for?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.919
Just to have a few girls over,
talk about our feelings...

04:54.002 --> 04:56.046
-And seek wisdom from the dead.
-Yeah, and that.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.381
Please?

04:57.923 --> 04:59.550
Yes, just be quiet.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.682
We have enough of a racket now that your
father brought home those dreadful teens.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.350
It's crazy how young they are.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.603
I know. Think about it. They don't
even remember a time before telegrams.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.064
How the world has changed.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.943
Look at me. I'm taking a lukewarm bath
in the comfort of my own kitchen.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.444
I never thought I'd have it so good.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.904
I call shotgun on the next bath.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.906
Last time, I had to wait
till everyone took theirs already

05:22.990 --> 05:24.658
and the water was disgusting.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.451
It's already pretty disgusting.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.453
We're gonna need more candles.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.710
This isn't worth it. It's too dangerous.

05:34.793 --> 05:37.421
I already told you. I'm being careful.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.089
I don't want you to worry.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.424
How can I not be worried?

05:40.507 --> 05:44.595
Henry, our lives are at stake.
I don't even know--

05:44.678 --> 05:45.679
Listen--

05:47.181 --> 05:49.099
It's not safe.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.274
I'm sorry to intrude.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.069
I was just looking for some candles.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.452
I don't think
we subscribe to this one.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.456
"The Political Power of Slave Masters"
by Anonymous.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.583
Who's Anonymous?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.797
Henry? Is it you?

06:23.425 --> 06:24.843
I didn't know you were a writer.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.221
No one can know.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.430
Is this your newspaper?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.557
The paper belongs to the people.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.768
So this is what you and Betty
were just arguing about.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.978
No one can know.

06:36.355 --> 06:37.564
I won't tell a soul.

06:39.816 --> 06:40.817
I promise.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.072
Henry, can I ask you something?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.990
All right.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.744
If you could put your name
on what you wrote, would you?

06:54.373 --> 06:55.582
I guess I would.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.378
Who wouldn't?

07:03.590 --> 07:04.842
Oh, great spirits...

07:07.469 --> 07:08.679
I bring to you...

07:10.848 --> 07:11.849
a poem.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.856
I ask you to show me the way.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.862
Tell me, spirits...

07:28.782 --> 07:33.662
if I should open the curtains
and let the light shine on me,

07:37.165 --> 07:38.917
or if I should remain in the dark.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.679
Hi.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.239
We're here. Where's the altar?

08:10.699 --> 08:14.161
Please be responsible for the energy
that you bring into this home.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.082
Please be responsible for the energy
that you bring into this home.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.418
-Please be responsible for the--
-We get it, Lavinia.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.503
Good vibes only.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.637
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.265
I just found these two in the backyard,
lighting matches and chasing crows.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.434
So thought you might want them back home.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.895
Yeah, they're definitely not
supposed to be doing that.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.524
Hey! I am your cousin.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.401
Hattie. I thought I heard your voice.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.363
-Hi. Is there something that you need?
-Yes. We're having a séance.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.656
-Another one?
-Yeah.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.825
-Can you stay?
-Why do you want her to stay?

08:54.409 --> 08:56.370
-She's a medium.
-I thought she was the maid.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.287
Okay.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.998
I'm a maid, a medium,
a washerwoman and a seamstress.

09:00.082 --> 09:04.503
I also write plays and autobiographical
sketches, sing in a quartet,

09:04.586 --> 09:08.006
sell my own hair care products and create
a unique line of floral centerpieces.

09:08.090 --> 09:08.924
Wow.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.509
I'm just a freelancer.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.386
Well, you're a very powerful clairvoyant,

09:12.469 --> 09:14.721
and I need to commune
with the spirits ASAP.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.766
You were so amazing last time.
We talked to so many ghosts.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.644
Yeah, I don't need to talk
to any more dead white people.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.937
Hattie, please.

09:22.938 --> 09:23.772
We can pay you.

09:23.856 --> 09:26.733
Well, then, yes. I would love to stay.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.819
Great. You guys should join too.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.238
You know, young women
make the most effective channels,

09:31.321 --> 09:34.074
because they are deeply susceptible
to otherworldly influences.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.077
Emily, they might not be ready.
They're too young. They might get scared.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.830
Getting scared is the whole point.

09:42.541 --> 09:46.170
Please be responsible for the energy
that you bring into this home.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.673
Palms down.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.010
Let us hum.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.724
Witchcraft was hung in History

09:59.933 --> 10:02.978
But History and I
Find all the Witchcraft that we need

10:03.061 --> 10:05.314
Around us, every day.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.360
Tonight, we hold this gathering...

10:11.695 --> 10:14.031
this ritual, this--

10:14.114 --> 10:15.824
-Moon circle.
-Thank you, Vinnie.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.286
As an opportunity to reflect...

10:20.621 --> 10:25.292
to renew, reprogram our consciousness.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.673
I personally have been feeling
a lot of uncertainty recently.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.091
Classic Sagittarius.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.761
And I'm hoping that through
tonight's channeling of energy,

10:35.844 --> 10:37.054
I will gain a higher clarity.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.058
And I just hope I don't lactate
through my séance garments.

10:41.934 --> 10:42.768
Ew.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.729
So, let us all start
by planting an intention,

10:46.396 --> 10:50.275
like a seed within the earth, that may
one day blossom into a flower of truth.

10:50.359 --> 10:55.113
And if anyone has jewelry or crystals,
feel free to charge them by the moonlight.

10:55.197 --> 10:57.157
-Jane, isn't that my necklace?
-Abby! Shh.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.951
-Okay, can I start?
-Go for it.

10:59.034 --> 11:04.831
So, first, I want to warn you all that my
energy may be particularly potent tonight,

11:04.915 --> 11:06.583
as I just got my period.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.211
Oh, my God. Me too. We're synced.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.005
Ideally, by the end of tonight,
we will all be synced.

11:13.423 --> 11:17.719
So, this Saturn retrograde
has got me questioning things with Ship.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.099
I mean, I know he's really hot, and he
lives in my house, and that's convenient,

11:22.182 --> 11:25.477
but I think he may have
the wrong idea about me.

11:26.144 --> 11:30.399
He thinks that it's my dream to become
some obedient housewife, but it's not.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.401
I wanna be free.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.529
I wanna have adventures.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.323
I wanna be like Lola Montez.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.492
-What?
-Who?

11:40.576 --> 11:42.953
Look, I don't even know
if I believe in monogamy.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.705
Why should I have to be with one person,

11:44.788 --> 11:46.582
and one person only,
for the rest of my life?

11:46.665 --> 11:48.375
You won't be if your husband dies, so...

11:48.458 --> 11:50.836
Yes, but it's bigger than that.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.462
What?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.548
I think marriage is just
a patriarchal system

11:54.631 --> 11:56.341
designed to make women less autonomous.

11:56.425 --> 12:00.679
You become your husband's property.
You have to bear his children.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.140
You even have to take his name.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.350
What if I don't want a last name?

12:05.434 --> 12:09.396
What if I just wanna be Vinnie? A symbol.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.691
These are such brave questions.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.193
I learned from the best.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.489
Does anybody else have any intentions?

12:21.033 --> 12:24.161
I'm feeling blessed.
I'm feeling activated.

12:24.703 --> 12:29.041
I'm feeling thankful to the spirits
for this fertile body.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.544
But sometimes it's hard
being a hot young widow.

12:32.628 --> 12:37.382
The time has come for me to finally deal
with my intergenerational trauma.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.014
My intention for tonight is to tell my
dead uncle that he's being inappropriate.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.850
I'm trying to clear the clutter
from my house,

12:46.934 --> 12:49.186
and I can't decide
what to do with all my swords.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.605
I wanna find out
if I'm allergic to anything.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.149
I wanna make spooky shit happen
and get paid.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.192
-Yes.
-Yeah.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.276
Respectfully.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.911
Tonight, I call upon the spirits
to guide me...

13:07.788 --> 13:08.872
to light my way...

13:11.375 --> 13:15.504
and help me find the path
that I must follow to reach my destiny.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.049
Great spirits, tell me.

13:20.259 --> 13:22.678
Please, tell me.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.515
Should I seek fame?

13:29.393 --> 13:33.730
Is there a spirit present
that can answer us?

13:35.649 --> 13:36.817
What was that?

13:37.943 --> 13:39.403
Goddess, you have the floor.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.166
So cool that you guys
have an indoor toilet.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.586
Goals, man.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.090
She's right. It doesn't go here.

14:00.174 --> 14:01.341
Where is your wife?

14:02.134 --> 14:04.303
I don't know. She's at some party.

14:04.386 --> 14:05.971
Oh, you let her go without you?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.348
I'm not gonna keep her from going.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.475
I just don't have
the same appetite for social life.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.853
That's cool.
You can do your own thing, I guess.

14:12.936 --> 14:13.770
Yeah.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.231
Sue can go to parties,
and I can stay at home

14:16.315 --> 14:18.942
and feel depressed
about my bad taste in art.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.154
Bad taste?
Dude, that sheep painting is boss.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.740
-Thanks, bro.
-Yeah.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.660
One day,
when my business ventures pay off,

14:29.411 --> 14:31.121
I'm gonna have a big house like this.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.665
With mad paintings of livestock.

14:33.749 --> 14:39.129
It's gonna be like: Sheeps, boom!
Cows, boom! Oxen, why not?

14:39.588 --> 14:42.216
Framed in gold, frickin' gleaming, man.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.009
And my wife's gonna decorate
the whole joint.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.969
Any idea who that wife will be?

14:46.386 --> 14:50.015
Well, it'll be Vinnie if she says yes.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.850
If she says yes?

14:52.976 --> 14:55.604
I think she will. She's always
been desperate to get married.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.730
I don't really get it.

14:57.356 --> 15:01.235
I'm like, "We're in our 20s.
It's time to settle down."

15:01.318 --> 15:04.905
I don't wanna be that loser
who's 30 and doesn't have a wife.

15:07.032 --> 15:11.078
Plus, these business guys, they just take
you more seriously if you have a wife.

15:11.995 --> 15:15.207
And also, I want kids. Lots of kids.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.960
Yeah, man. I hear you.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.839
You guys been tryin', or...

15:23.590 --> 15:24.716
It's complicated.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.929
When we got married,
Sue wasn't ready, I guess.

15:31.139 --> 15:37.271
And I keep waiting
for the right time to come, but...

15:38.856 --> 15:40.065
I don't know.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.734
What if it never does?

15:46.321 --> 15:48.073
We have our hands full, don't we?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.202
-Yeah.
-These modern women.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.999
Everybody stay centered.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.542
Witchcraft is no joke.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.378
We must honor the ancestors
who passed down their wisdom to us.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.505
The witches of Salem walked
so we could run.

16:03.589 --> 16:07.092
Dark spirits, we await you.

16:20.898 --> 16:24.818
Edward, I had
the most refreshing bath today.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.122
"Captain Thomas Taylor."

16:47.049 --> 16:50.511
Edward. Can you hear that?

16:55.224 --> 16:58.227
Captain, is that you?

17:03.357 --> 17:05.692
Look! Look, look, look, she's possessed!

17:05.776 --> 17:08.529
She's 1,000% possessed right now.
This is wild!

17:08.612 --> 17:13.075
Oh, my God. A musical medium. This is how
the spirits present themselves.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.992
-There is no other way to explain this.
-Oh, my God.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.412
She's classically trained.
We have the same piano teacher.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.829
She's faking.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.169
-See?
-I'm still not convinced.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.214
You guys, this is--
You have to take this seriously.

17:28.298 --> 17:32.386
I am trying to find the answer
to a question that can change my life.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.346
We're leaving 'cause we're bored.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.722
Rude!

17:36.640 --> 17:37.850
Let us hold hands.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.274
Spirits, we welcome you.

17:51.947 --> 17:53.115
Is that...

17:53.782 --> 17:55.075
Millard Fillmore?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.412
Yeah. It's the ghost
of Lavinia's dead cat.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.080
My familiar.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.457
-A familiar is, like, a pet a witch has.
-Please stop.

18:02.541 --> 18:06.795
Here, kitty, kitty. Here--

18:06.879 --> 18:08.172
You guys, help me.

18:08.255 --> 18:12.217
Here, kitty, kitty.

18:14.970 --> 18:17.931
Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
I'm fine. We're fine.

18:19.975 --> 18:24.563
Captain, if you are still alive
in the waves...

18:25.939 --> 18:29.067
give me your location.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.488
Tell me your latitude, your longitude.

18:41.955 --> 18:42.956
Sixty.

18:46.126 --> 18:51.423
47 out of 100 degrees north.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.219
Eight.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.679
Four hundred and sixty-eight

18:57.763 --> 19:03.310
out of 1,000 degrees east.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.397
You say something, dear?

19:10.859 --> 19:11.860
No, Edward.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.865
Someone spoke to me.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.579
What is happening?

19:22.663 --> 19:24.373
There is a dark energy in the room.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.457
I'm scared.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.168
No, no, this is good.
This is what we want. Keep focusing.

19:30.087 --> 19:31.547
Oh, God.

19:31.630 --> 19:32.548
What the--

19:32.631 --> 19:33.799
Oh, my God.

19:38.846 --> 19:40.389
What the--

19:59.491 --> 20:00.742
Oh, shit. This is real.

20:04.788 --> 20:05.998
Oh, shit!

20:06.707 --> 20:08.375
Oh, my God! Spirits!

20:11.044 --> 20:12.212
Show me the light!

20:22.389 --> 20:24.016
-We're scared.
-I'm scared.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.100
Me too.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.060
Everybody stay calm.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.647
Let me find some matches.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.275
Be careful.

21:02.179 --> 21:05.182
Come on. Okay.

21:16.151 --> 21:17.152
Help me.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.372
What do you want from me?

21:30.791 --> 21:33.293
I recognize you. I do. Just...

21:34.962 --> 21:36.171
tell me.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.466
Who are you?

21:39.550 --> 21:40.717
I'm nobody!

21:41.760 --> 21:42.970
Who are you?

21:44.805 --> 21:47.099
Are you - nobody - too?

21:47.683 --> 21:49.977
Why do you keep asking me that?

21:51.937 --> 21:53.146
Am I nobody?

21:56.316 --> 21:57.776
You know, maybe I am.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.361
Then there's a pair of us!

22:01.113 --> 22:04.908
don't tell! they'd advertise - you know!

22:05.325 --> 22:09.538
How dreary - to be - Somebody!

22:38.734 --> 22:42.279
Sue! Sue, I need to talk to you.

22:47.701 --> 22:48.994
Last night was crazy.

22:49.745 --> 22:50.746
I know.

22:52.456 --> 22:55.792
I think I gotta take a break
from these séances.

22:55.876 --> 23:00.923
-Emily. You look exhausted.
-Sue. I wanna be published.

23:01.757 --> 23:02.925
-You do?
-Yes.

23:04.843 --> 23:07.387
I have to be published, or I'll die.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.807
This is quite a change from yesterday.

23:10.891 --> 23:11.892
I had a vision.

23:12.935 --> 23:17.314
A terrible... terrible vision
of what it would mean to be anonymous.

23:18.732 --> 23:22.110
I don't want to disappear from this earth
without anybody knowing who I am.

23:22.194 --> 23:26.240
I have this demon in my mind
that keeps trying to stop me,

23:27.407 --> 23:28.408
but I won't let it.

23:29.201 --> 23:30.619
I don't want to be a nobody.

23:30.702 --> 23:33.413
That is exactly
what I have been trying to tell you.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.290
I'm so glad you're seeing this.

23:35.374 --> 23:41.505
I want you to give my poem to Sam Bowles,
to publish in The Springfield Republican.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.299
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

23:45.342 --> 23:46.677
He's right here in the parlor.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.359
-Hi.
-Hi, yourself.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.280
Sam stayed at the inn last night
after the ball in Concord.

24:07.531 --> 24:08.532
You were at the ball?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.659
I'm at all of the balls.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.619
I'm a baller.

24:12.703 --> 24:16.081
Sam, Emily has something
that she wants to tell you.

24:19.209 --> 24:22.504
-I want to be published in your--
-I think I overheard already.

24:24.756 --> 24:25.757
It's exciting.

24:26.717 --> 24:30.512
Yes. Yes, I just--
I want to put myself out there.

24:32.681 --> 24:33.682
Great.

24:35.726 --> 24:37.895
It'll go straight to the top of my pile.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.023
To the top of your pile?

24:41.106 --> 24:43.692
Yeah. I'm just super underwater right now.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.611
I've got a lot of submissions
to go through,

24:45.694 --> 24:48.113
but I'm really looking forward
to reading this one.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.158
When will it be published?

24:51.241 --> 24:53.493
If it's accepted, then...

24:54.161 --> 24:55.162
fairly soon.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.289
And when will I know
if it's been accepted?

24:58.373 --> 24:59.833
I'll...

25:00.584 --> 25:01.668
I'll keep you posted.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.212
Okay.

25:04.588 --> 25:05.589
Okay.

25:06.507 --> 25:08.008
Okay, great.

25:10.302 --> 25:11.303
It's wonderful.
