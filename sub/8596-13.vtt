WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:02.337
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.421 --> 00:04.798
There are
consequences, bell.

00:05.006 --> 00:07.258
Lincoln is dead.

00:07.467 --> 00:11.429
We bring you chancellor pike
of the sky people.

00:11.638 --> 00:12.597
Where are you
taking him?

00:12.806 --> 00:13.640
To the new
commander.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.684
May I join you?

00:15.892 --> 00:18.520
Luna, we're on our way.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.730
Nightblood.
Luna has it.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.857
That's why we
have to find her.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.485
If she can
access Alie 2--

00:25.694 --> 00:28.029
then she can tell us
how to stop Alie 1.

00:28.238 --> 00:30.281
Jaha is using the chips
to control everyone.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.367
The more minds
turned to the task,

00:32.575 --> 00:34.619
the more powerful
Alie becomes.

00:34.828 --> 00:36.287
Now that Arkadia
has fallen,

00:36.496 --> 00:38.123
we'll move on to stage two.

00:38.331 --> 00:39.833
What we're doing
is too important,

00:40.041 --> 00:43.169
and we won't be done
until everyone is with us.

01:09.946 --> 01:11.740
About what
I expected.

01:11.948 --> 01:14.117
Shut your mouth.

01:15.994 --> 01:18.204
Hey...

01:18.413 --> 01:21.207
We should leave.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.959
Think you're
gonna find peace

01:23.168 --> 01:24.836
with the new
commander?

01:40.143 --> 01:41.561
Go on. Move.

01:57.577 --> 01:59.621
Chancellors.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.456
Jackson?

02:01.664 --> 02:02.999
What the hell
are you doing here?

02:05.335 --> 02:06.628
Those aren't
necessary.

02:06.836 --> 02:08.713
This man belongs
to the commander.

02:15.386 --> 02:18.056
It's all right,
Jackson.

02:19.390 --> 02:20.391
Mm.

02:32.737 --> 02:35.365
Thelonious,
what is this?

02:35.573 --> 02:38.243
This is the chip.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.332
I thought you were crazy.
Now I know you are.

02:44.541 --> 02:48.628
This is unity,
like you always wanted.

02:48.837 --> 02:52.215
Everyone back away,
or the commander dies.

02:52.423 --> 02:55.218
Thank God. Briggs,
grant, get behind me.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.803
Uh!

02:57.011 --> 03:00.598
Huh huh huh! Rrgh!

03:00.807 --> 03:04.936
Uh! Briggs!
You're farm station. Rrgh!

03:05.145 --> 03:07.772
There are no
stations here,

03:07.981 --> 03:11.693
just the
city of light.

03:11.901 --> 03:14.779
Join us,
Charles, please.

03:14.988 --> 03:16.948
There's no more need
for fighting.

03:17.157 --> 03:18.992
We both know

03:19.200 --> 03:22.328
there's no way in hell
I'm taking that thing.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.666
Sorry it has
to be this way.

03:26.875 --> 03:31.713
No! Uh!
Uh! Uh! No.

03:33.506 --> 03:36.926
How about you,
Marcus?

03:37.135 --> 03:40.221
We need him.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.265
He can help us
find Clarke

03:42.473 --> 03:45.852
and the other a.I.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.321
That was a mistake.

03:56.529 --> 03:58.740
I don't think so.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.992
You will.

04:01.201 --> 04:03.369
Oh! Let me go!

04:03.578 --> 04:08.833
We are still experiencing
a 3% rejection rate.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.461
Don't put Marcus
with the others.

04:12.587 --> 04:15.256
Leave him to me.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.094
She can be
persuasive.

05:09.394 --> 05:12.230
Chancellor,
Dr. Griffin.

05:12.438 --> 05:13.815
Thank you for
coming, Charles.

05:14.023 --> 05:16.693
I didn't know
I had a choice.

05:16.901 --> 05:20.029
So what is
all this?

05:20.238 --> 05:22.073
What I'm about
to tell you

05:22.282 --> 05:23.408
is classified.

05:23.616 --> 05:25.326
If you tell anyone
any part of it--

05:25.535 --> 05:29.122
I'll be floated.
I understand.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.581
Good.

05:30.790 --> 05:32.750
I need you to teach
a crash course

05:32.959 --> 05:35.044
in wilderness
survival--

05:35.253 --> 05:38.006
farming, hunting,
building shelters.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.590
To the prisoners?

05:39.799 --> 05:42.302
Yes.

05:42.510 --> 05:46.681
Well, can I ask why?

05:52.562 --> 05:54.856
We're sending them
to the ground.

05:56.858 --> 05:59.360
We have 99
prisoners here.

05:59.569 --> 06:01.070
We've divided
them into small,

06:01.279 --> 06:02.447
more manageable
groups.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.824
They'll be dead
the moment the door opens.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.451
The ground
won't be survivable

06:06.659 --> 06:09.537
for another hundred
years or more.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.252
What did you find?
Tell me.

06:16.461 --> 06:17.545
We're only
telling you

06:17.754 --> 06:19.172
what you need
to know, Charles,

06:19.380 --> 06:21.758
nothing more.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.926
Your daughter's
in the sky box.

06:24.135 --> 06:25.595
It must be pretty
compelling evidence

06:25.803 --> 06:27.138
of survivability
if you're willing

06:27.347 --> 06:29.182
to risk her life.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.268
Clarke's in solitary.

06:32.477 --> 06:34.979
You won't
be seeing her.

06:35.188 --> 06:37.273
That's OK.

06:37.482 --> 06:40.151
She paid attention
the first time.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.779
Look. I've--I've taught
most of these kids already

06:42.987 --> 06:44.072
or--or tried to.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.533
They're not exactly
receptive learners,

06:47.742 --> 06:49.369
though I suppose
they will be now.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.329
They don't know
they're going.

06:51.537 --> 06:52.663
And if you
tell them--

06:52.872 --> 06:55.958
I'll be floated.
Got that.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.419
Think of it
this way.

06:58.628 --> 07:00.546
You finally get
to teach earth skills

07:00.755 --> 07:04.008
to kids who might
actually use them.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.514
Admittedly, it's--

07:09.722 --> 07:11.849
it's a leap
of faith, Charles.

07:13.518 --> 07:15.603
Take it with us.

07:18.398 --> 07:20.566
I can have them
ready in 4 months,

07:20.775 --> 07:21.818
3 if I--

07:22.026 --> 07:24.362
they leave
in two weeks.

07:26.906 --> 07:29.700
Ha ha! Uh...

07:38.042 --> 07:39.919
When do I start?

07:45.049 --> 07:47.635
Let's go.

07:51.931 --> 07:54.058
Take a seat.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.894
OK. Come on.

08:00.106 --> 08:01.983
OK. Keep moving.

08:03.985 --> 08:05.111
Oh...

08:30.636 --> 08:32.930
It's the girl
under the floor.

08:35.641 --> 08:38.019
Welcome to earth skills.

08:51.115 --> 08:54.285
It's been an hour since
we passed the airplane wreckage.

08:54.494 --> 08:57.497
Seeing as we're using a map
without any distances,

08:57.705 --> 08:59.832
it could be days before
we reach Luna's village.

09:00.041 --> 09:00.917
At least we know
we're going

09:01.125 --> 09:02.168
the right direction.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.669
We're running
out of daylight.

09:03.878 --> 09:05.213
We should stop in the sun,
recharge the battery.

09:05.421 --> 09:08.090
What sun? We keep
going until it dies.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.343
We keep going until
we get to Luna.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.765
This her?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.099
Yes.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.185
What do you think
she's gonna say

09:19.393 --> 09:21.646
when we show up asking
to put an a.I. In her head?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.148
Lincoln
said she helps

09:24.357 --> 09:25.316
those that are
in trouble.

09:25.525 --> 09:26.484
She'll help us, too.

09:33.199 --> 09:34.617
Think she can help us
find a better map?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.202
Backtrack.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.788
We'll find somewhere where
the trees aren't so bad.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.414
Hey! Ohh...

09:40.623 --> 09:41.916
Guess we're
going on foot.

09:46.337 --> 09:49.882
Anyone hear the part
where I said it could be days?

09:50.091 --> 09:51.217
Stop.

09:53.678 --> 09:55.346
You hear that?

09:55.555 --> 09:57.390
Water.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.852
Eyes sharp. They
could be hostile.

10:02.061 --> 10:04.730
They're not hostile.
Put the guns down.

10:25.501 --> 10:28.421
Where's the village?

10:39.640 --> 10:43.060
No.
Oh, no. It can't be.

10:54.822 --> 10:58.326
Isn't a village. It's
just a bunch of rocks.

10:58.534 --> 11:01.495
She's gone.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.081
What do we do now?

11:34.945 --> 11:36.781
The ability to make fire

11:36.989 --> 11:39.492
kept the human race alive
during the ice age.

11:41.619 --> 11:45.373
There we go.
Here we go.

11:45.581 --> 11:47.625
Yeah.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.251
Who knows?

11:49.460 --> 11:52.338
It may do the same
for us someday.

12:00.638 --> 12:03.307
Ahh...Voila--

12:03.516 --> 12:07.311
the difference
between life and death.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.945
Thank you,
Mr. Murphy.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.197
Perhaps you'd
like to tell us

12:18.406 --> 12:20.950
the key to surviving
on the ground.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.869
No, not really.
No.

12:26.497 --> 12:29.083
Ms. Blake,
how about you?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.670
The key to survival
on earth, what is it?

12:34.004 --> 12:35.506
Not dying?

12:39.135 --> 12:41.095
You can laugh all you want,

12:41.303 --> 12:43.139
but we've got
a lot to learn here--

12:43.347 --> 12:45.558
making fire, tying knots,

12:45.766 --> 12:48.352
how to navigate using the stars,
how to hunt.

12:48.561 --> 12:51.772
You have to learn which plants
you can eat and which--

12:51.981 --> 12:54.608
which ones
we can smoke?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.569
Mr. Jordan,
that is precisely why

12:56.777 --> 12:59.864
we had to separate you
and Mr. green.

13:00.072 --> 13:04.243
Listen. The answer
to my question.

13:04.452 --> 13:08.914
The key to surviving
on the ground and on the ark

13:09.123 --> 13:12.418
is to keep fighting
at all costs

13:12.626 --> 13:15.629
against all odds.

13:15.838 --> 13:21.761
The minute you give up,
you're dead.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.641
Am I boring you,
Mr. Murphy?

13:30.561 --> 13:32.980
I'll survive.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.575
Uh uh...Uh!

13:44.784 --> 13:46.535
Uh! Uh...

13:48.829 --> 13:50.706
Uh...Uh!

13:50.915 --> 13:55.169
Uh! Hey, you want
to kill me, kill me!

13:55.377 --> 13:57.963
Uh...Ah! Ugh!

14:01.342 --> 14:03.177
Uh! Uh!

14:04.428 --> 14:06.555
Briggs, you don't
have to do this.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.098
You're strong!
Fight it!

14:08.307 --> 14:11.143
We'll get our people
and get out of here.

14:11.352 --> 14:14.730
Briggs! Uh!

14:14.939 --> 14:16.941
Who's ready
to take the key?

14:23.239 --> 14:25.115
Ohh...

14:25.324 --> 14:26.116
Uh!

14:29.411 --> 14:32.414
What are the odds?

14:32.623 --> 14:35.209
John Murphy?

14:35.417 --> 14:38.462
Told you
I'd survive.

14:38.671 --> 14:42.216
You should have
killed me on that battlefield.

14:43.843 --> 14:46.470
I won't make
the same mistake.

15:01.026 --> 15:05.281
You killed 300
of my people.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.909
Now you'll take
300 cuts

15:09.118 --> 15:11.662
by my hand.

15:13.789 --> 15:16.375
Get on with it.

15:23.716 --> 15:27.219
Hnngh! Ohh...

15:32.099 --> 15:33.309
Hnngh!

15:34.643 --> 15:36.645
Uhh!

15:38.856 --> 15:43.027
Rrgh! Ugh!

15:43.235 --> 15:45.487
Uh...

15:45.696 --> 15:49.199
Aah!

15:56.206 --> 15:58.459
It'll be dark soon.

15:58.626 --> 16:00.586
We need to talk about
what we're gonna do.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.212
We wait until
first light,

16:02.421 --> 16:03.881
and then we split up
and search the shore

16:04.089 --> 16:05.841
in both directions

16:06.050 --> 16:08.052
heh. Ah...

16:09.178 --> 16:10.971
Nice.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.767
Yes.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.567
I agree.

16:23.776 --> 16:24.860
Lincoln wouldn't
have put this spot

16:25.069 --> 16:26.278
on the map
unless it was important.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.948
Don't touch that.

16:37.498 --> 16:41.418
Come on, o.
How long?

16:42.461 --> 16:44.421
I don't know.

16:44.630 --> 16:47.633
I can't even
look at you...

16:49.134 --> 16:50.594
Because every
time I do,

16:50.803 --> 16:53.055
I see pike putting that
gun to Lincoln's head.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.309
I hear the gunshot.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.605
I see him fall.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.819
I didn't kill Lincoln.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.114
No, but he is dead
because of you.

17:10.322 --> 17:12.616
I came to you.

17:12.825 --> 17:15.119
You didn't
take my help.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.871
If you had just
trusted me, I--

17:35.055 --> 17:36.890
What did you
just do?

17:37.099 --> 17:40.477
Nothing. I just threw
these in the fire.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.106
What is it?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.371
Huh. Signal fire.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.165
He was trying
to tell us.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.876
This is how
we contact Luna.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.130
I'll get more.

18:29.485 --> 18:32.613
Uh!

18:32.821 --> 18:34.656
Abby.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.492
Marcus,
oh, thank God.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.786
Are you all right?
Did they hurt you?

18:38.994 --> 18:42.998
They found me hiding
in the woods near the camp.

18:43.207 --> 18:46.877
Please tell me you
know where Clarke is.

18:47.086 --> 18:49.963
No. I thought
she was here.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.299
He's telling
the truth.

18:52.508 --> 18:56.386
No. I saw them
shoot at her.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.348
She got in the rover
with Jasper,

18:59.556 --> 19:01.975
and they got away,
I'm--I'm sure.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.268
Well, that's good.

19:03.477 --> 19:04.394
If the others
found her,

19:04.603 --> 19:05.646
that means
she's safe.

19:05.854 --> 19:09.733
Listen to me.
They're after Clarke.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.027
How do you know
they're after her?

19:12.236 --> 19:15.072
They questioned me
for hours.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.243
She has something
that they want.

19:19.451 --> 19:22.788
What? What?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.124
I don't know.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.876
We don't have
time for this.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.503
If Ontari is right

19:29.711 --> 19:31.797
and Clarke finds
another nightblood,

19:32.005 --> 19:34.842
she'll be able to
activate the other a.I.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.886
We can't let
that happen.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.680
Marcus...

19:44.101 --> 19:45.894
I'm afraid.

19:55.696 --> 19:58.282
Try harder.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.229
He knows.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.065
Marcus.

20:35.611 --> 20:39.239
You've taken
the chip.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.456
Put him on the cross.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.374
Abby...

20:49.583 --> 20:50.667
Abby.

20:50.876 --> 20:52.961
Abby, wait!

20:53.170 --> 20:55.380
Uh! Abby!

20:55.589 --> 20:58.759
Uh! Oh! Abby.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.179
This is madness.
Please.

21:02.387 --> 21:05.349
Uh! Oh! Don't.

21:05.557 --> 21:09.853
Oh...Abby,
this is madness!

21:10.062 --> 21:11.980
- This is unity.
- Abby, please--

21:12.189 --> 21:16.735
- take the key.
- Please...Wake up.

21:16.944 --> 21:20.197
Just tell us where Clarke
and the others are hiding.

21:22.074 --> 21:25.619
I can't do that.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.912
I--

21:36.505 --> 21:37.714
Yaah!

21:38.840 --> 21:39.925
Gaah!

21:42.678 --> 21:43.762
Yaah!

21:45.389 --> 21:47.808
Aah! Ohh...

21:58.485 --> 22:00.529
Agh!

22:00.737 --> 22:05.617
Agh! Aah! Aah!

22:05.826 --> 22:09.162
Aah! Aah!

22:09.371 --> 22:11.748
Aah!

22:11.957 --> 22:15.627
Aah! Aah!

22:25.429 --> 22:29.683
Let me guess, you
came here to fix things,

22:29.891 --> 22:33.937
Wanheda
the peacemaker.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.605
I came to see
if you're OK.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.317
Well, I don't
need your help.

22:49.745 --> 22:53.165
Clarke,
I've lost her.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.175
Give her time,
Bellamy.

23:04.718 --> 23:05.802
There may be
blood on your hands,

23:06.011 --> 23:08.096
but it's
not Lincoln's.

23:08.305 --> 23:11.350
Some of it is.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.643
Maybe, but you

23:13.852 --> 23:16.605
didn't want
that to happen.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.233
You tried
to stop it.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.362
Octavia will forgive
you eventually.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.697
The question is,

23:25.906 --> 23:29.409
will you
forgive yourself?

23:34.289 --> 23:37.250
Forgiveness
is hard for us.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.970
I was so angry at you
for leaving.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.227
I don't want to feel
that way anymore.

24:00.899 --> 24:02.818
You know, you're
not the only one

24:03.026 --> 24:06.238
trying to
forgive yourself.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.907
Maybe we'll
get that someday...

24:11.701 --> 24:14.830
But we need
each other, Bellamy.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.750
What we're
doing now,

24:18.959 --> 24:21.461
the only way we're
gonna pull this off

24:21.670 --> 24:24.047
is together.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.035
Huh! Uh!

24:54.244 --> 24:55.537
Uh! Uh!

24:58.540 --> 24:59.624
Mmph mmph!

25:10.927 --> 25:13.472
No. No. It's OK.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.100
Uh! Oh!

25:29.863 --> 25:32.532
Skaikru,
bringers of death.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.493
Why should we give you
safe passage?

25:36.661 --> 25:38.622
Lincoln.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.628
He sent us.

25:54.513 --> 25:57.432
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.108
What is that?

26:08.610 --> 26:09.945
Safe passage.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.698
What does it do?

26:19.871 --> 26:22.082
Octavia, wait.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.417
I trust Lincoln.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.254
If only she drinks,
only she goes.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.506
See you
on the other side.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.927
O.

26:34.135 --> 26:35.845
Oh, crap.

26:36.054 --> 26:37.681
Oh, God...

26:39.349 --> 26:41.977
Last chance.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.272
Together.

27:31.318 --> 27:34.988
I'm sorry to hear
about your son's arrest.

27:35.196 --> 27:38.158
Will he be in
my class today?

27:38.366 --> 27:41.745
No. We're
keeping Wells

27:41.953 --> 27:44.247
in solitary until
launch tomorrow.

27:49.336 --> 27:52.422
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

27:52.631 --> 27:55.008
You don't want him
telling the others

27:55.216 --> 27:56.468
that the ark
is dying.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.677
Charles--

27:57.886 --> 27:59.763
it's the only thing
that makes sense.

27:59.971 --> 28:01.765
Why else would
you send kids,

28:01.973 --> 28:04.517
and not scientists?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.853
Do you even care
if they live or die?

28:10.815 --> 28:12.525
We are talking
about my son.

28:12.734 --> 28:15.320
Yes. Then send me
with them.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.739
Out of the question.

28:17.947 --> 28:18.865
What you
teach them will--

28:19.074 --> 28:21.826
well, I've taught
them nothing!

28:24.621 --> 28:28.083
They don't care,
so they don't learn.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.126
They don't pay attention
because they don't think

28:30.335 --> 28:31.795
they have a reason to.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.005
Let me tell them we're
sending them down,

28:34.214 --> 28:35.590
and maybe if they're
afraid, then--

28:35.799 --> 28:37.967
no. No.

28:38.176 --> 28:40.136
Please.

28:40.345 --> 28:43.682
I've only got one more
class to reach them.

28:43.890 --> 28:48.019
Then figure out
a way to reach them

28:48.228 --> 28:51.690
because you
are all they've got.

29:02.951 --> 29:05.078
Ha ha!

29:05.286 --> 29:08.498
All right. Can we just
get out of here, seriously?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.500
You got better things
to do, Murphy?

29:10.709 --> 29:12.460
Oh, it that
an offer, McIntyre?

29:12.669 --> 29:14.629
You're an epic
dick, Murphy.

29:23.888 --> 29:28.268
Everybody take
your seats. Now!

29:31.187 --> 29:35.692
I'm sure all of you
will be glad to know

29:35.900 --> 29:39.320
that we are officially done
talking about earth skills.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.197
Oh, great.
In that case--

29:41.406 --> 29:43.825
sit down.

29:52.417 --> 29:55.086
How would you feel
about assisting me

29:55.295 --> 29:58.465
with today's lesson,
Mr. Murphy?

29:59.924 --> 30:01.676
Sign me up.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.264
What the hell
was that fo--

30:06.473 --> 30:09.142
- oh!
- Oh! Oh, jeez.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.117
I know all about
you, John Murphy.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.161
- Ah, you do, huh?
- Yeah. I do.

30:29.287 --> 30:31.164
Mother drank
herself to death

30:31.372 --> 30:33.458
after father
was floated

30:33.666 --> 30:37.420
for stealing medicine
to save you.

30:37.629 --> 30:39.130
That's a tough
row to hoe.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.757
I'll give you that.

30:40.965 --> 30:44.010
So what does he do
with the second chance

30:44.219 --> 30:48.640
his father gave his life
to buy for him?

30:48.848 --> 30:51.476
Wasted it

30:51.684 --> 30:53.269
setting the
arresting officer's

30:53.478 --> 30:56.856
quarters on fire.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.275
Say something.

31:01.152 --> 31:02.028
Uh!

31:05.406 --> 31:08.159
Do something.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.998
You know, I get it--

31:14.207 --> 31:16.668
trying to teach us
to fight back.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.295
- Wrong.
- Hey! Hey!

31:19.504 --> 31:21.214
Uh! Uh!

31:21.422 --> 31:22.966
- Stop it!
- Uhh!

31:23.174 --> 31:25.051
- Oh!
- Leave him alone!

31:25.260 --> 31:27.303
No one is coming
to help you.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.305
No one is coming to help
any of you.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.683
Uh! Uh!

31:32.809 --> 31:35.687
Get off him!
Get off him!

31:38.857 --> 31:40.692
Is that all you got?

31:42.026 --> 31:44.487
It's gonna take
more than the kids

31:44.696 --> 31:47.448
from your own
station to save you.

31:47.657 --> 31:51.953
- Who will save you?
- Open the door! Help!

31:54.622 --> 31:55.790
Override.

31:55.999 --> 32:01.337
Don't you see?
This is life or death.

32:01.546 --> 32:02.589
Uh!

32:04.090 --> 32:05.758
Open the door! Help!

32:08.386 --> 32:09.304
Hey!

32:12.640 --> 32:15.351
- Charles, you all right?
- Fine.

32:15.560 --> 32:18.813
Are you out of your minds?
What the hell is this?

32:20.982 --> 32:24.319
This is
graduation.

32:28.907 --> 32:31.576
Congratulations.

32:31.784 --> 32:34.537
Class dismissed.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.211
Nngh! Aah!

32:42.420 --> 32:44.172
Agh! Ah!

32:46.174 --> 32:49.218
You can't break me,
grounder. Aah!

32:49.427 --> 32:51.679
If you want her to stop, maybe
you should try shutting up.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.139
Only one way
this stops.

32:53.348 --> 32:54.974
Nngh!

32:55.183 --> 32:57.060
What is wrong
with you people?

32:57.268 --> 32:58.686
He's strong.

32:58.895 --> 33:00.480
We need him if we're gonna
fight our way out of here.

33:00.688 --> 33:02.565
- Listen to me!
- Agh! Nngh!

33:04.901 --> 33:07.570
Our real enemy
is out there.

33:10.531 --> 33:12.992
Jaha has an army
of chipped soldiers.

33:13.201 --> 33:15.328
They don't feel any pain.

33:15.536 --> 33:16.829
That means they're not
gonna stop until all of us

33:17.038 --> 33:19.248
either join them
or die.

33:21.668 --> 33:23.670
Don't waste
your breath, kid.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.518
Ask yourself this.

33:38.726 --> 33:41.479
Do you want your
revenge,

33:41.688 --> 33:43.898
or you want
your people to live?

33:49.278 --> 33:51.531
Both.

33:54.659 --> 33:57.578
I'll get my revenge,

33:57.787 --> 34:00.164
just not today.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.136
Go float yourself.

34:13.344 --> 34:16.472
Everything I learned,
I learned on the ground.

34:18.307 --> 34:19.767

Marcus,
let me stop the pain.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.807
He's strong.

37:05.016 --> 37:09.854
Yes,
always has been.

37:10.062 --> 37:13.524
Marcus, I'm afraid
we're out of time.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.946
We need to know
where the resistance

37:19.155 --> 37:23.618
you led against
pike hides.

37:24.869 --> 37:28.414
Just shoot me.
Shoot me.

37:28.623 --> 37:32.001
If I shoot you,
I won't get the answer.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.716
Oh...Oh...Oh...

37:39.842 --> 37:41.844
Wait.

37:42.053 --> 37:43.596
You can stop this.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.556
All right.

37:46.974 --> 37:48.351
I'll do it.

37:49.769 --> 37:51.354
I'll do it.

39:18.149 --> 39:19.942
My sword's gone.

39:20.151 --> 39:21.277
Guns, too.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.348
Luna.

39:54.268 --> 39:56.896
Where's Lincoln?

39:58.564 --> 40:00.441
Lincoln is dead.

40:07.031 --> 40:09.492
Lincoln said that
you would help us.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.243
Did he?

40:11.452 --> 40:15.081
Luna, you're the
last of your kind,

40:15.289 --> 40:17.458
the last nightblood.

40:17.666 --> 40:21.337
So Lexa's dead,
as well.

40:21.545 --> 40:22.755
Her spirit has
chosen you to become

40:22.963 --> 40:24.673
the next commander.

40:24.882 --> 40:26.634
Titus entrusted me
with the flame

40:26.842 --> 40:28.177
to give to you.

40:28.386 --> 40:30.638
Then he should have
told you that I left

40:30.846 --> 40:33.849
my conclave swearing
to never kill again.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.478
You don't
have to kill.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.271
To lead is
your birthright.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.233
How you lead
is your choice.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.692
Here.

40:47.655 --> 40:51.242
I recognize
the sacred symbol,

40:51.450 --> 40:52.952
but what is that?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.954
This is the flame

40:55.162 --> 40:57.456
that holds the spirits
of the commanders,

40:57.665 --> 40:59.750
of Lexa.

40:59.959 --> 41:01.794
Will you take it
and become

41:02.002 --> 41:04.171
the next commander?

41:13.389 --> 41:14.265
No.

41:22.565 --> 41:25.860
Hey, wait.
