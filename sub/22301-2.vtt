00:13.513 --> 00:16.683
[Dan] <i>I believe strongly</i>
<i>that good cooking is physical.</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:23.065
<i>It demands a kind of conditioning.</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:27.944
<i>Because of the drudgery</i>
<i>and the hours and the exhaustion</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.822
<i>that this kind of work demands...</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:35.910
<i>it does attract people who are</i>
<i>attracted to a certain kind of abuse.</i>

00:38.913 --> 00:39.997
<i>It's exhilarating,</i>

00:40.082 --> 00:44.043
<i>and the challenge is sort of,</i>
<i>"How much of it can you stand?"</i>

00:44.961 --> 00:47.505
And is that the way to live,
you know, a happy life?

00:47.589 --> 00:51.968
I don't have the answer to that...
at all. I wonder.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.054
[opening theme playing]

01:54.989 --> 01:58.993
There's a real advantage
to creating a cuisine, a menu

01:59.076 --> 02:02.705
where the vectors don't
all point at you, at the chef.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.169
<i>Where the food you're eating</i>
<i>or the place that you're at</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:09.879
<i>points out to something larger...</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:14.217
<i>a restaurant that has</i>
<i>an overriding message and purpose.</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:16.093
<i>It's about something.</i>

02:26.854 --> 02:30.817
[Ruth] <i>Dan is really a model</i>
<i>of who the modern chef is...</i>

02:30.900 --> 02:33.445
Welcome. Nice to have you.
Here we go. We'll start right now.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.698
...whose goal is to do more than

02:36.781 --> 02:40.535
just feed people
a delicious dinner in their restaurant,

02:40.618 --> 02:44.997
<i>but wants to change his community</i>
<i>and, ultimately, the world.</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:48.460
<i>That's a very different place</i>
<i>for a chef to be</i>

02:48.543 --> 02:51.463
than a chef has ever been before.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.964
[man] The ecology,

02:53.047 --> 02:56.718
the profitability for the farmer,
the sustainability...

02:56.801 --> 03:00.263
What makes Dan different
is that he is an investigative reporter.

03:02.599 --> 03:07.729
<i>The fascination of</i>
<i>eating in Blue Hill,</i>

03:07.812 --> 03:09.606
<i>and Blue Hill at Stone Barns,</i>

03:09.689 --> 03:14.193
<i>is everything that comes out there,</i>
<i>you can look so deeply into.</i>

03:14.277 --> 03:16.904
[Dan] Okay, white pepper egg
with cheddar cheese.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.407
[Ruth] <i>With Dan's cooking,</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:24.161
you taste things that just taste better

03:24.246 --> 03:28.625
<i>than any pea you've ever had before,</i>
<i>any radish you've ever had before.</i>

03:28.708 --> 03:33.087
<i>A carrot that is, like,</i>
<i>the carrotness of carrot.</i>

03:33.170 --> 03:35.673
He's looking for the "a-ha" moment
where you go...

03:35.757 --> 03:42.347
<i>"Oh! This is what this tastes like?</i>
<i>Tell me about this. Why is this so great?"</i>

03:42.430 --> 03:47.394
That's a new notion
of who a chef is in the world.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.104
So your next course is a...
is a piece of bread.

03:50.187 --> 03:51.606
It's a piece of toast,

03:51.689 --> 03:55.318
but it's a very special piece of toast
because it's a new wheat.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.654
[Ruth] <i>He did start out</i>
<i>just wanting to be a chef</i>

03:57.737 --> 03:59.406
<i>and wanting to serve delicious food,</i>

03:59.489 --> 04:03.743
<i>but he's got such a restless mind</i>
<i>and such a curious imagination</i>

04:03.826 --> 04:05.662
<i>that he always asks the next question,</i>

04:05.745 --> 04:07.079
"Why is this better?"

04:07.163 --> 04:09.291
[Dan] What's new? What's good?
What's different?

04:09.374 --> 04:14.211
[Ruth] <i>When you question everything,</i>
<i>you very quickly get to the ethics</i>

04:14.296 --> 04:19.050
<i>and to the biology</i>
<i>and to the deeper questions.</i>

04:19.133 --> 04:20.217
<i>"How do we use the planet?</i>

04:20.302 --> 04:22.345
<i>What are our responsibilities</i>
<i>to our neighbors?</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:24.556
<i>What are our responsibilities</i>
<i>to the future?"</i>

04:24.639 --> 04:27.434
<i>Dan asks himself</i>
<i>all those questions as a chef,</i>

04:27.517 --> 04:31.646
but he started with the very basic,
"I just wanna cook good food."

04:51.958 --> 04:56.671
[Dan] <i>We opened Blue Hill, New York</i>
<i>in the spring of 2000.</i>

04:57.964 --> 05:01.258
[David] <i>The idea came up</i>
<i>that we could open a NYU bistro,</i>

05:01.343 --> 05:03.678
<i>a sort of neighborhood place.</i>

05:03.761 --> 05:06.931
I figured, you know, if we can break even
and cover the rent of this thing

05:07.014 --> 05:10.685
and have a showcase for Dan's food
and start to build something,

05:10.768 --> 05:11.769
it'll lead somewhere,

05:11.853 --> 05:13.938
<i>and that is kind of the way</i>
<i>that restaurant opened.</i>

05:16.899 --> 05:21.404
I think the food was good.
I don't think we opened with great food.

05:22.238 --> 05:26.409
<i>We'd been open a couple months.</i>
<i>We were tired and it was grinding along.</i>

05:26.493 --> 05:28.411
<i>It was deep into asparagus season</i>

05:28.495 --> 05:30.913
<i>and I had come back</i>
<i>from the farmer's market</i>

05:30.997 --> 05:32.957
<i>with a couple of cases of asparagus,</i>

05:33.040 --> 05:34.959
and I opened up
the walk-in refrigerator

05:35.042 --> 05:39.088
and there were just cases
lined to the ceiling of asparagus,

05:39.171 --> 05:42.425
and here I was with four more,
and I just-- I lost it.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.767
<i>I was just like, "How the fuck</i>
<i>is this thing on the market list?"</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:56.022
So I did this kind of edict thing where,
"Every dish is getting asparagus tonight.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.068
<i>Every goddamn dish has asparagus.</i>

06:02.404 --> 06:05.364
<i>We're gonna do asparagus ice cream.</i>

06:06.198 --> 06:08.242
<i>Every single dish."</i>

06:08.325 --> 06:11.287
It was one of those things where
it was like, "This is ridiculous."

06:14.707 --> 06:18.420
<i>I was just like, you know, "We're gonna</i>
<i>freaking embarrass ourselves tonight."</i>

06:18.503 --> 06:21.255
<i>But I was so dug in to my damn position</i>

06:21.338 --> 06:24.216
<i>that there was no way</i>
<i>I was going back on it.</i>

06:25.217 --> 06:29.764
<i>I felt like this was a test</i>
<i>I couldn't afford to fail,</i>

06:29.847 --> 06:32.058
<i>and so I went with it.</i>

06:36.020 --> 06:37.855
<i>Two hours later, Jonathan Gold,</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:41.901
the most important, respected
restaurant reviewer in the country,

06:41.984 --> 06:42.985
walks in the door.

06:46.363 --> 06:51.118
<i>What was clearly</i>
<i>a very stupid decision on my part</i>

06:51.202 --> 06:54.497
<i>played itself out</i>
<i>in the worst possible way.</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:57.667
<i>I just thought we were gonna get skewered.</i>

06:57.750 --> 07:00.878
<i>Jonathan Gold doesn't</i>
<i>show his emotions on his sleeve.</i>

07:00.962 --> 07:04.173
<i>So I had no goddamn clue</i>
<i>what the man thought of the meal</i>

07:04.256 --> 07:06.342
<i>until the article hit.</i>

07:09.471 --> 07:11.639
<i>He loved it.</i>

07:11.723 --> 07:14.559
<i>He defined us before</i>
<i>we really knew who we were.</i>

07:14.642 --> 07:17.311
<i>He named us the new epitome</i>
<i>of farm-to-table,</i>

07:17.394 --> 07:20.106
<i>a restaurant that was not shy</i>

07:20.189 --> 07:24.861
<i>about advertising a product</i>
<i>that was at the height of its flavor.</i>

07:24.944 --> 07:27.989
It's not as if that idea
was a foreign concept to us.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.617
We opened Blue Hill,
naming after a family farm.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.828
<i>But people who read the review</i>
<i>wanted to work here</i>

07:33.911 --> 07:35.872
<i>'cause it was an up and coming idea.</i>

07:35.955 --> 07:37.289
<i>That was very important,</i>

07:37.832 --> 07:41.252
<i>the level of interest</i>
<i>in wanting to carry a message forward.</i>

07:50.344 --> 07:52.680
Broth for, uh, mushroom here, please.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.560
Hey, one new egg, please.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.311
[Dan] Okay, broth, yeah.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.190
[cook 1] Is that on the go?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.569
Make two eggs going to 23.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.070
[cook 2] Getting on that broth.
[cook 1] Eggs, 23.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.322
[Dan] Pick up. Uh, 54.

08:13.075 --> 08:16.078
[Ruth] <i>Dan... became the voice</i>

08:16.162 --> 08:20.542
of the "farm-to-table" movement
very consciously.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.544
<i>He cooks with the seasons.</i>

08:22.627 --> 08:26.338
<i>He uses what comes from the farm today.</i>

08:26.422 --> 08:30.677
Farm-to-table is exactly
what's in season right then.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.346
-First of the Crispino.
-First of the Crispino, yes.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.932
From the greenhouse to 21.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.183
Yes, Chef.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.518
[Ruth] <i>It's an old way of eating.</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:40.603
I mean, it's the way our ancestors ate

08:40.687 --> 08:44.190
until there was
refrigeration and air-freight,

08:44.273 --> 08:47.109
but we've completely
turned that on its head

08:47.193 --> 08:50.738
in the 20th and 21st centuries
where we just think,

08:50.822 --> 08:51.864
"The world is our oyster.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.117
We can have
everything we want all the time,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.911
and it doesn't matter
how good it tastes."

09:01.874 --> 09:05.419
We're a nation of immigrants,
and when we came here,

09:05.502 --> 09:08.840
we had abundance
like no one had ever seen.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.094
<i>Imagine entering the Garden of Eden.</i>

09:13.177 --> 09:15.429
<i>You've got everything</i>
<i>you could ever dream of.</i>

09:15.512 --> 09:18.015
<i>Why become a culture of great cooking</i>

09:18.099 --> 09:23.062
<i>when you have the abundance to make steaks</i>
<i>and eat tremendous amounts of meat?</i>

09:24.355 --> 09:28.067
But most of the greatest cuisines
of the world came out of hardship.

09:28.150 --> 09:32.071
<i>They were all forced into a negotiation</i>
<i>between peasants and a landscape,</i>

09:32.154 --> 09:34.156
<i>and that landscape was not</i>
<i>producing the abundance</i>

09:34.240 --> 09:36.283
<i>that we associate with American abundance.</i>

09:36.367 --> 09:37.660
<i>That was never a problem here,</i>

09:37.744 --> 09:40.121
<i>and so we didn't adopt</i>

09:40.204 --> 09:43.499
the more difficult,
less-coveted cuts of meat

09:43.583 --> 09:47.294
or varieties of vegetables and grains
because we didn't need to.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.214
<i>That's a real tragedy of our history.</i>

09:51.257 --> 09:54.468
<i>You have the recipe</i>
<i>for what is American cuisine today,</i>

09:54.551 --> 09:56.262
<i>which isn't really a cuisine.</i>

09:56.345 --> 09:59.891
Not great ingredients in large abundance,
that's sort of... that's the story.

10:00.975 --> 10:04.145
<i>How do you get out of that?</i>
<i>How do you get away from that?</i>

10:04.228 --> 10:06.773
[Ruth] <i>What Dan has understood is,</i>

10:06.856 --> 10:08.565
it doesn't matter
how good your technique is,

10:08.650 --> 10:11.568
if you don't have good ingredients,
you can't make good food.

10:13.154 --> 10:17.116
[Dan] <i>I'm not an activist. You know,</i>
<i>I wouldn't put that on my business card.</i>

10:17.199 --> 10:18.660
But what I've come to understand,

10:18.743 --> 10:23.289
and I have yet to find any example
that flies in the face of this,

10:23.372 --> 10:26.793
<i>that when you are</i>
<i>chasing after the best flavor,</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:28.628
<i>you are chasing after</i>
<i>the best ingredients,</i>

10:28.711 --> 10:30.504
<i>and when you're chasing after</i>
<i>the best ingredients,</i>

10:30.587 --> 10:33.883
<i>you are in search of great farming.</i>

10:45.937 --> 10:48.230
<i>My grandmother often talked about</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:52.944
<i>the mesmerizing beauty</i>
<i>of Blue Hill Farm in the 1960s.</i>

10:53.027 --> 10:56.322
With the sun over here,
this is beautiful.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.617
<i>Every summer,</i>
<i>all I wanted to do was be at the farm.</i>

11:02.829 --> 11:07.124
<i>I remember working really hard</i>
<i>in the fields, really long hours,</i>

11:07.208 --> 11:10.419
and lifting heavy bales of hay
and loading them into the barn,

11:10.502 --> 11:14.590
<i>and I found it very exhilarating</i>
<i>to be a part of that.</i>

11:14.673 --> 11:17.259
It's very purpose-driven work.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.723
Remember it took, like, three weeks
to do just this, these two fields.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.640
<i>When my grandmother took over the farm,</i>

11:23.725 --> 11:26.352
<i>she understood that you needed</i>
<i>to have cows on the land</i>

11:26.435 --> 11:28.312
<i>to get the nutrients from the cows</i>

11:28.395 --> 11:31.774
<i>and produce good grass,</i>
<i>which ended up being good hay.</i>

11:33.067 --> 11:34.485
<i>But when she died,</i>

11:34.568 --> 11:41.325
<i>we had 20 years of no animals on the land</i>
<i>and a yearly haying operation...</i>

11:42.576 --> 11:47.164
<i>and we ended up seeing</i>
<i>a wholesale decline in Blue Hill Farm.</i>

11:47.248 --> 11:49.751
There was a sense that
there wasn't gonna be pasture,

11:49.834 --> 11:52.128
it wasn't gonna look like
anything we had remembered,

11:52.211 --> 11:55.047
<i>if we didn't do something.</i>

11:55.131 --> 11:56.465
[Dan] <i>My brother and I were thinking,</i>

11:56.548 --> 11:58.968
<i>"How do we preserve what</i>
<i>my grandmother wanted to preserve,</i>

11:59.051 --> 12:00.177
<i>which is open landscape,</i>

12:00.261 --> 12:03.806
<i>and how do we make the farm</i>
<i>and the landscape productive?"</i>

12:03.890 --> 12:07.059
<i>What was needed was animals.</i>

12:08.227 --> 12:11.605
<i>And so, dairy was a great way</i>
<i>to think about that.</i>

12:14.733 --> 12:16.861
<i>And if I want great milk,</i>
<i>I have to support</i>

12:16.944 --> 12:20.614
the continuing improvement of the pasture.
Well, now we're in the chicken business.

12:22.324 --> 12:27.246
<i>Because what better way to break up</i>
<i>the manure from these dairy cows</i>

12:27.329 --> 12:30.582
<i>and spread it in the fields?</i>
<i>Chickens.</i>

12:30.666 --> 12:35.712
Okay, we're in the chicken business
and we're getting lots of eggs.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.090
<i>But there is a serious problem,</i>
<i>as there always is,</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:39.801
<i>with encroaching forest.</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:43.012
We're surrounded by dense, thick forest

12:43.095 --> 12:45.514
that continually wants to
encroach on the field.

12:45.597 --> 12:48.767
<i>And so how do we push it back? Goats.</i>

12:48.851 --> 12:52.479
<i>Goats will eat this bramble,</i>
<i>the things that cows won't eat,</i>

12:52.563 --> 12:55.566
and so, all of a sudden,
we're in the goat business

12:55.649 --> 12:58.194
<i>and I'm figuring out</i>
<i>how to cook with goat.</i>

12:58.277 --> 13:00.362
Blue Hill Farm goat shoulder,
Blue Hill Farm.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.073
<i>And then when you start</i>
<i>pushing back the forest,</i>

13:02.156 --> 13:03.782
<i>well, you've got</i>
<i>the opportunity to do pigs,</i>

13:03.866 --> 13:06.702
<i>and so why wouldn't we be</i>
<i>in the pig business?</i>

13:06.785 --> 13:10.747
As you get deeper
into these symbiotic relationships,

13:10.832 --> 13:13.792
you're only improving the grass,

13:13.876 --> 13:15.336
and if you're improving the grass,

13:15.419 --> 13:18.089
you're improving every bite
that the dairy cows are taking,

13:18.172 --> 13:20.174
and if you're improving every bite
the dairy cows are taking,

13:20.257 --> 13:21.300
you're improving the milk.

13:21.383 --> 13:25.847
<i>To support the continual improvement</i>
<i>of the whole system</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:28.265
<i>is the goal for better flavor...</i>

13:30.351 --> 13:33.980
<i>which, in another sense,</i>
<i>is all going to support</i>

13:34.063 --> 13:38.275
<i>the vision that our grandmother had</i>
<i>to preserve the open space.</i>

13:38.359 --> 13:40.069
It's not just the support
of the open landscape,

13:40.152 --> 13:43.447
not just support of the dairy,
it's the support of better flavors.

13:43.530 --> 13:45.157
<i>One and the same.</i>

13:50.246 --> 13:52.957
[Jack] <i>Stone Barns Center's</i>
<i>more than just a working farm.</i>

13:53.707 --> 13:55.126
<i>We're a farm laboratory,</i>

13:55.209 --> 13:59.505
<i>so we do a lot of projects with</i>
<i>different universities and seed companies,</i>

13:59.588 --> 14:02.841
<i>and we also have</i>
<i>a really strong educational focus,</i>

14:02.925 --> 14:06.678
<i>so we're able to have this kind of</i>
<i>inter-disciplinary relationship</i>

14:06.762 --> 14:12.018
<i>between educators, farmers, engineers,</i>
<i>health care practitioners, chefs.</i>

14:12.101 --> 14:14.811
We wanna show
really good farming practices,

14:14.896 --> 14:16.438
the best farming practices,

14:16.522 --> 14:17.773
<i>and Blue Hill at Stone Barns</i>

14:17.856 --> 14:21.402
<i>is a restaurant companion</i>
<i>for this organization.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:26.240
[Ruth] <i>The magic of</i>
<i>Blue Hill at Stone Barns is...</i>

14:26.323 --> 14:30.494
<i>first of all, you pull up to</i>
<i>this gorgeous location.</i>

14:30.577 --> 14:34.831
<i>You're in the country</i>
<i>and you pass these fields</i>

14:34.916 --> 14:39.211
<i>and you watch the light fade</i>
<i>and you're in this beautiful room.</i>

14:39.962 --> 14:41.213
<i>You're given the menu.</i>

14:41.297 --> 14:46.802
<i>It's just a list of what</i>
<i>they've reaped from the farm.</i>

14:48.262 --> 14:53.809
<i>Then they bring</i>
<i>this profusion of foods out</i>

14:53.893 --> 14:59.148
<i>that are beautiful, that are seasonal,</i>
<i>that are completely delicious.</i>

14:59.231 --> 15:01.943
<i>It's an amazing experience.</i>

15:04.111 --> 15:05.196
[Dan] <i>I wanna make sure</i>

15:05.279 --> 15:08.365
<i>that the diner is understanding</i>
<i>where this ingredient is coming from,</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:10.784
<i>and usually there's a lot of interest</i>
<i>for people who come here on,</i>

15:10.867 --> 15:12.869
"What am I eating?
Where's it from? Who's growing it?

15:12.954 --> 15:14.830
How's it getting to me
and what's this about?"

15:14.914 --> 15:18.167
And that's a starting point
for a conversation.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.086
We're gonna start here
with weeds from the farm,

15:20.169 --> 15:21.170
tomatoes on the vine.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.256
[Ruth] <i>It's another idea</i>
<i>of what a restaurant can be</i>

15:24.340 --> 15:28.802
<i>because it aims to educate people.</i>

15:28.885 --> 15:31.138
[server] Heirloom tomato with basil seed,

15:31.222 --> 15:34.558
followed by Jim Myers'
Indigo Rose experimental tomatoes

15:34.641 --> 15:35.726
and smoked goat cheese.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.312
[diner 1] Great. Looks nice.
[diner 2] Thank you.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.064
[Dan] <i>Plates are pretty simple.</i>

15:40.147 --> 15:44.610
I do that so that we don't lose
the overall idea of what we're doing.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.699
<i>You want the feeling of the meal</i>
<i>and the holistic idea of the meal</i>

15:50.782 --> 15:52.534
to resonate with you
long after you leave.

15:55.037 --> 15:59.541
<i>It's not just about the dish.</i>
<i>It's about what the radish represents.</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:02.586
<i>It has to add up to something</i>
<i>larger than a plate of food.</i>

16:02.669 --> 16:04.213
[man] Vegetables from the farm.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.632
[diners] Thank you.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.386
Single-udder butter comes from
the milk of one single cow.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.222
This is from three cows at Blue Hill Farm.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.266
Invite you to taste
each individual butter

16:15.349 --> 16:17.018
and see the differences you find.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.560
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.481
[Michael] <i>I've always been an admirer</i>
<i>of Dan's philosophy.</i>

16:22.564 --> 16:27.028
<i>Looking at it as more of a relationship</i>
<i>with farmers, with agriculture,</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:30.322
thinking of utilizing the whole farm,
instead of,

16:30.406 --> 16:32.908
you know, just buying always
the product that you want.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.495
<i>Getting creative with the product</i>
<i>that not everybody wants.</i>

16:36.578 --> 16:39.123
[Dan] ...organizes this.
This we're thinking about.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.584
This we have to really think about,
'cause we got three cases.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.546
This we gotta start thinking about.
This is for this week.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.840
Next week, we have, um...

16:48.924 --> 16:51.010
We have the dogfish.
We gotta figure that one out.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.720
-I was thinking we could do the dogfish...
-Okay.

16:53.804 --> 16:58.642
...fried today in Adam's beer batter
and then serve it with phytoplankton.

16:58.725 --> 16:59.935
-Fish and chips?
-That's good, actually.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.313
[Michael] We could slice it thin
and almost do, like, the tacos...

17:02.396 --> 17:03.480
but fried fish.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.399
That and they can swipe it
through the phytoplankton.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.525
Whoa.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.527
[cook] Like a Baja fish taco,
like the fried fish taco.

17:08.610 --> 17:09.903
-That's great. Great.
-Okay.

17:09.986 --> 17:13.907
[Ruth] <i>It's so easy</i>
<i>just to eat high on the hog.</i>

17:13.990 --> 17:16.243
<i>I mean, the artistry in cooking</i>

17:16.327 --> 17:19.830
comes not from taking a chop
and throwing it on the fire,

17:19.913 --> 17:24.251
but from knowing how to make sausage,
how to make head cheese.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.753
<i>That requires real knowledge,</i>

17:26.837 --> 17:31.883
<i>and one of the things that Dan</i>
<i>is doing at Blue Hill is using everything.</i>

17:31.967 --> 17:35.554
-Pig face, rib and blood.
-Pig face, rib and blood with Crispino.

17:37.514 --> 17:40.392
[Dan] <i>We need to redefine</i>
<i>our definition of fine dining</i>

17:40.476 --> 17:45.021
<i>to help lead us</i>
<i>in a redefinition of everyday eating.</i>

17:45.106 --> 17:51.862
That's gonna take some wit, you know,
and creativity and some technique.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.366
<i>But that's the challenge</i>
<i>and that's part of the craft of cooking,</i>

17:55.449 --> 17:57.284
<i>which is why I keep</i>
<i>coming back to cooking.</i>

17:57.368 --> 18:00.829
I don't see how this movement
continues its advance

18:00.912 --> 18:03.999
without real culinary application.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.588
[Ruth] <i>He has two</i>
<i>different briefs right now,</i>

18:09.671 --> 18:13.425
<i>and one is, as a chef and restaurateur,</i>
<i>to please his customers</i>

18:13.509 --> 18:17.763
<i>and make that a really</i>
<i>wonderful experience for people.</i>

18:17.846 --> 18:20.141
-Hello, good evening! How are you?
-Hi. Good.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.892
Welcome. Nice to have you.

18:21.975 --> 18:24.770
[Ruth] <i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>a responsibility</i>

18:24.853 --> 18:31.485
to be an ever-curious and ever-vigilant
voice for ethical, sustainable food.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.196
[Jack] We did something
a little bit different this year.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.615
[Dan] <i>I think that chefs</i>
<i>play a really key role</i>

18:36.698 --> 18:40.035
<i>because we have this power</i>
<i>now that we never had.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:41.203
<i>Not that long ago,</i>

18:41.287 --> 18:44.456
<i>chefs were in the dungeons of the kitchen</i>
<i>and they were never heard from.</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:47.668
That's changed, for the good,
whether you believe that

18:47.751 --> 18:51.130
chefs should have the celebrity
status they have now or not...

18:51.213 --> 18:56.510
<i>but to use chefs as the canvas</i>
<i>to broadcast these ideas</i>

18:56.593 --> 18:58.220
<i>is the right way to think about it.</i>

18:58.304 --> 19:00.096
This is a buttercup squash.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.559
Great. Super exciting.
[exclaims]

19:03.642 --> 19:04.810
[David] <i>It's bigger than Dan.</i>

19:04.893 --> 19:08.647
<i>None of this works without</i>
<i>the collaboration of a lot of people,</i>

19:08.730 --> 19:11.942
<i>and those people need to be like-minded</i>

19:12.025 --> 19:14.611
<i>in the sense that they're</i>
<i>trying to change the status quo,</i>

19:14.695 --> 19:17.948
and that's where he can be
a really inspirational leader.

19:18.031 --> 19:21.160
Very exciting experiment
happening at Blue Hill Farm.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.453
As you know, we...

19:22.536 --> 19:24.955
[Adam] <i>The biggest challenge</i>
<i>of working with Dan is</i>

19:25.038 --> 19:28.334
we're always moving, pushing,
looking for something new,

19:28.417 --> 19:33.004
looking for a new angle, looking for
a way to rethink what we're doing.

19:33.088 --> 19:37.301
<i>I've never felt like we've arrived,</i>
<i>and I don't think we ever will arrive.</i>

19:37.384 --> 19:40.387
There are times that can be
very difficult and frustrating.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.389
I'll be totally honest.
It can be quite frustrating,

19:43.056 --> 19:46.768
<i>but it's also incredibly exciting</i>
<i>to be a part of something like that.</i>

19:46.852 --> 19:48.895
We got our work cut out for us this fall

19:48.979 --> 19:53.317
to bring this message to the dining room
and share the excitement.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.819
Friend of mine said,
"The world needs more zealots,"

19:55.902 --> 19:57.153
referring to my brother.

19:57.238 --> 20:00.115
<i>It's true. You need somebody</i>
<i>who's gonna keep driving,</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:02.201
<i>devoting their life to their pursuit...</i>

20:02.284 --> 20:04.911
<i>and Dan is about change.</i>

20:04.995 --> 20:06.580
Okay, guys, we gotta go to work.
Thank you.

20:06.663 --> 20:08.999
-Thank you, Chef.
-Let's go do some good.

20:09.082 --> 20:14.921
And the volume of that responsibility
and the ripple effects are intoxicating.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.136
[Dan] Are you cool for this
or you got it already?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.013
[cook] It's all yours.

20:23.096 --> 20:26.975
[Michael] <i>I've never worked with a chef</i>
<i>that is in the trenches with you.</i>

20:27.058 --> 20:31.647
From our menu meetings in the morning
to running around all service long.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.399
[Dan] Yeah, let's do this together, no?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.192
[Michael] <i>He's in there,</i>
<i>cooking with us every single day.</i>

20:36.277 --> 20:38.737
[Dan] Now we wanna do toast, right?

20:39.363 --> 20:42.198
[David] <i>People who don't give up</i>
<i>get other people's attention,</i>

20:42.283 --> 20:45.286
<i>and I think that determination with Dan</i>
<i>runs through every vein.</i>

20:45.369 --> 20:47.913
I mean, he just does not quit...

20:47.996 --> 20:49.039
ever.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.124
We're plating four pig, right?
Four pig, yes?

20:51.207 --> 20:52.208
[cook] Yes, Chef!

20:52.293 --> 20:54.210
-Behind that, eight duck.
-[cook] Yes!

20:54.295 --> 20:57.005
[David] <i>You know, it's inspiring,</i>
<i>but it's also daunting</i>

20:57.088 --> 21:02.511
to watch them throw their entire life
behind the pursuit of being better,

21:02.594 --> 21:04.763
being more knowledgeable,
being more thorough.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.224
If it's not gonna be perfect, don't do it.

21:08.309 --> 21:12.103
[Adam] <i>I think people really just think</i>
<i>he sits and writes a lot and is a thinker,</i>

21:12.187 --> 21:16.567
<i>but he's truly a working chef</i>
<i>this far into his career.</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:21.112
A lot of other chefs aren't doing that.
He's there all the time.

21:21.196 --> 21:24.658
Too much... for his own good,
but that's just me.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.496
[Dan] <i>That kind of drive or devotion</i>
<i>to what you're doing is expensive.</i>

21:29.580 --> 21:31.164
<i>What's the cost?</i>

21:35.502 --> 21:36.837
[David] <i>He has a daughter.</i>

21:36.920 --> 21:39.172
<i>He started a family.</i>
<i>He's got an 18-month old.</i>

21:39.255 --> 21:43.302
<i>So I hope that that proves</i>
<i>a joy and a reward for him.</i>

21:44.094 --> 21:46.555
You know, I hope that there's a balance.

21:47.180 --> 21:50.392
-Tonight, we have beet salad with plums.
-[Aria] Beets?

21:50.476 --> 21:52.436
Yum. Thank you.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.482
Want a little plum, baba?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.734
-You want plum-a?
-[babbling]

21:58.817 --> 21:59.860
You want me to have it?

21:59.943 --> 22:02.613
That's for Daniel?
Okay, that seems fair.

22:06.742 --> 22:10.871
[David] <i>As I reflect back on him as a kid,</i>
<i>he was a relatively quiet kid.</i>

22:10.954 --> 22:13.374
<i>You know, he wasn't bursting with talent.</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:16.335
My mother died when I was four.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.214
<i>She had cancer, so I ended up</i>
<i>doing a lot of cooking for myself,</i>

22:21.297 --> 22:23.467
<i>and that's probably</i>
<i>where this all started.</i>

22:23.550 --> 22:26.052
[David] <i>I think we were consciously</i>
<i>and unconsciously</i>

22:26.136 --> 22:27.513
<i>quite protective of one another</i>

22:27.596 --> 22:31.600
and making sure that things went
as best as they could at the time.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.354
<i>He was always observant.</i>
<i>He was articulate but not outspoken,</i>

22:36.438 --> 22:39.691
<i>and he was a good learner.</i>
<i>He was a good studier.</i>

22:39.775 --> 22:42.611
<i>It took a disproportionate</i>
<i>amount of his time,</i>

22:42.694 --> 22:43.779
<i>and people would question,</i>

22:43.862 --> 22:45.489
"Do you really wanna
spend that kind of time reading?

22:45.572 --> 22:47.073
Do you really wanna
spend that kind of time

22:47.157 --> 22:48.158
working on your writing?"

22:48.241 --> 22:49.367
Like, "What's your goal?"

22:50.577 --> 22:54.998
<i>And I think along the way, he was deciding</i>
<i>what he was gonna put his efforts to.</i>

22:55.081 --> 22:58.502
<i>His first love in food</i>
<i>that I was aware of was bread.</i>

22:58.585 --> 23:02.756
I came to visit him at college
and he had, like, six bags of bread

23:02.839 --> 23:05.676
and he had me tasting
all these different breads

23:05.759 --> 23:07.010
and wanting to know what I thought

23:07.093 --> 23:09.721
and why I thought this was different
and what he liked about this or that,

23:09.805 --> 23:11.723
and I was like, "What's with the bread?"

23:12.849 --> 23:15.894
<i>He's just like, "I don't know.</i>
<i>I think when I graduate, I wanna bake."</i>

23:17.938 --> 23:21.442
[Dan] <i>I moved to LA to work with</i>
<i>Nancy Silverton and La Brea Bakery</i>

23:21.525 --> 23:25.571
which was, at the time,
considered the best in America

23:25.654 --> 23:29.115
and one that was sort of redefining
how we think about bread.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.826
<i>I figured, "If I'm gonna</i>
<i>learn how to bake bread,</i>

23:30.909 --> 23:32.285
<i>I wanna go with the best."</i>

23:32.368 --> 23:35.789
<i>Drove down to LA and showed up at her door</i>
<i>and just begged her for a job,</i>

23:35.872 --> 23:37.749
<i>and that's how I got in there.</i>

23:37.833 --> 23:41.086
<i>But I was really not talented at all.</i>

23:41.169 --> 23:43.379
<i>I was not a good baker,</i>
<i>and there was a big account,</i>

23:43.464 --> 23:46.550
and I mixed 1,300 pounds
of rosemary dough.

23:47.175 --> 23:50.512
<i>But for this particular day,</i>
<i>I forgot to add the salt in the recipe.</i>

23:50.596 --> 23:54.265
I just remember looking into the ovens
and we saw this bread going up,

23:54.349 --> 23:59.437
and then just like as if
the crescendo of a concert or whatever,

23:59.521 --> 24:02.357
they all fell flat like pizza...

24:02.440 --> 24:05.861
and just in that one moment,
I was like, "Jesus, man."

24:05.944 --> 24:09.322
<i>Nancy was there,</i>
<i>talking to her manager,</i>

24:09.405 --> 24:11.700
<i>and she was just like,</i>
<i>"I can't let this kid ruin my business."</i>

24:11.783 --> 24:14.495
<i>It was my first time</i>
<i>I ever got fired from a job,</i>

24:14.578 --> 24:16.371
<i>so I learned a lot through that.</i>

24:16.454 --> 24:20.501
[Ruth] <i>When Nancy Silverton fired him,</i>
<i>it became a challenge.</i>

24:20.584 --> 24:25.255
"Let me figure out
how to make the best bread."

24:27.382 --> 24:29.676
[cook] This one is amazing.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.470
So...

24:33.639 --> 24:36.558
Smell that. Fucking beautiful.
I mean, beautiful.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.810
[Dan] <i>When we think of</i>
<i>Western civilization,</i>

24:38.894 --> 24:41.730
<i>you start to realize</i>
<i>it was built from wheat.</i>

24:42.689 --> 24:46.151
<i>Grains represent 65% of our agriculture.</i>

24:46.234 --> 24:49.487
<i>Vegetables and fruits are about 6%.</i>

24:49.571 --> 24:51.322
We eat more wheat
than just about anything.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.910
<i>The problem is that we don't eat</i>
<i>true, whole wheat.</i>

24:54.993 --> 24:57.495
We eat wheat that's dead and denuded.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.081
<i>So it'll last. It's shelf stable.</i>

25:01.166 --> 25:03.418
<i>Part of the reason</i>
<i>that it has absolutely no flavor</i>

25:03.501 --> 25:06.254
<i>is because agri-business</i>
<i>is looking for crops</i>

25:06.337 --> 25:09.591
that can last a long time in travel
or last a long time in your refrigerator.

25:09.675 --> 25:14.012
<i>They're not looking for flavor.</i>
<i>They're not looking for nutrition.</i>

25:14.095 --> 25:17.057
<i>The real disaster is that in all of this,</i>

25:17.140 --> 25:21.144
<i>we lost the taste of wheat</i>
<i>and we lost all the health benefits,</i>

25:21.227 --> 25:24.815
and for something that we eat so much of,
it's really a true disaster.

25:26.232 --> 25:28.276
<i>If we're gonna change the food system,</i>

25:28.359 --> 25:32.530
<i>we have to change</i>
<i>how we grow and consume wheat.</i>

25:34.700 --> 25:38.662
[Ruth] <i>I've never really met</i>
<i>another chef like Dan.</i>

25:38.745 --> 25:41.832
<i>He's just endlessly thoughtful.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:44.710
Taking it back and back
and back and back

25:44.793 --> 25:47.295
until he gets to the soil.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.760
[Dan] <i>If you think of soil</i>
<i>like a bank account,</i>

25:53.844 --> 25:57.889
<i>many of the crops that we love require</i>
<i>a tremendous amount of soil fertility,</i>

25:57.973 --> 26:01.309
<i>which is to say they require</i>
<i>a big withdrawal from the bank.</i>

26:02.477 --> 26:06.481
<i>Every time we eat,</i>
<i>we are withdrawing from a communal bank.</i>

26:06.564 --> 26:10.652
<i>The question is, "How do you</i>
<i>make a deposit into this bank account?"</i>

26:10.736 --> 26:14.656
[Klaas] These two are rye.
This was triticale.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.575
[Dan] <i>You need to return fertility</i>
<i>back to the soil to get another crop.</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:21.412
<i>So you can't count on the idea that soil</i>
<i>will continue to give you a harvest,</i>

26:21.496 --> 26:22.497
<i>'cause it won't,</i>

26:22.580 --> 26:27.377
<i>unless you're using chemicals like</i>
<i>most conventional American agriculture.</i>

26:27.460 --> 26:29.921
<i>One of the responsibilities</i>
<i>of organic farming</i>

26:30.005 --> 26:33.800
is to return fertility
without using chemicals.

26:33.884 --> 26:36.720
[Klaas] Actually, we just stepped
over something here.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.221
[Dan] Red Dock.

26:38.304 --> 26:43.184
Red Dock means that there is a shortage
of soluble calcium in the surface.

26:43.268 --> 26:47.188
Now, we don't have a lot of Red Dock,
so I know this field has enough calcium.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.025
[Dan] <i>One way to do it</i>
<i>is to use rotation crops.</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:51.526
<i>Plant actual crops</i>

26:51.609 --> 26:55.321
that create a lively community
of microorganisms in the soil

26:55.405 --> 26:59.200
that will ultimately translate into
your tasting something more delicious

26:59.284 --> 27:02.620
<i>than a plant grown</i>
<i>in denuded soil in chemicals.</i>

27:02.704 --> 27:05.999
[Dan] You're planting soy.
You're favoring doing it after rye?

27:06.082 --> 27:09.210
-Yes, based on what we're seeing.
-That's what you're seeing.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.046
[Dan] <i>You cannot taste great flavor</i>

27:11.129 --> 27:15.759
<i>unless the soil's a fully active</i>
<i>biological community,</i>

27:15.842 --> 27:18.469
and the mechanics of that
are difficult to explain.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.807
I've spent a long time researching.
I've talked to a ton of people.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.935
<i>All we know for sure is that</i>
<i>the more life there is in the soil,</i>

27:25.018 --> 27:27.813
<i>the more potential you have</i>
<i>for the creation of flavor.</i>

27:27.896 --> 27:29.815
You have to stick to the rotation here

27:29.898 --> 27:33.318
because you have to have a crop
following its most suitable predecessor.

27:33.401 --> 27:34.652
[Dan] <i>Organic farmers have to do it.</i>

27:34.736 --> 27:37.155
<i>They have to return that fertility</i>
<i>back to the soil.</i>

27:37.238 --> 27:39.615
<i>And what we've become accustomed to</i>

27:39.700 --> 27:41.868
<i>is that they're going to</i>
<i>plant these crops at a loss</i>

27:41.952 --> 27:45.663
and they'll make up the difference
with a wheat crop or a crop that we covet.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.957
<i>What we ought to do is</i>

27:47.040 --> 27:51.211
<i>be encouraging them</i>
<i>to grow these rotation crops</i>

27:51.294 --> 27:54.380
<i>not just to feed the soil,</i>
<i>but also to feed us.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:58.134
It seems like everywhere you turn,
rye is such an important crop.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.803
Yeah, that's right.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.304
How much would it help you

28:01.387 --> 28:04.725
if people were eating more rye and
creating more of a market for your rye?

28:04.808 --> 28:05.934
It would help a lot.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.144
[Dan] <i>I'd like to give</i>
<i>an economy to the farmer.</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:12.398
I'd like to give an incentive
to the farmer to grow more rotation crops.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.985
[server] In front of you is a risotto
of sorts, but instead of rice,

28:15.068 --> 28:17.320
-you have a variety of legumes and grains.
-[diner] Thank you.

28:17.403 --> 28:18.989
[Dan] <i>And that's the challenge here.</i>

28:19.072 --> 28:23.159
<i>How do we put the pieces together</i>
<i>and celebrate the Hudson Valley</i>

28:23.243 --> 28:25.536
in a way that supports
good agriculture and good farming?

28:25.620 --> 28:27.413
So that's what we're after.

28:32.377 --> 28:36.589
<i>I wanna think about ways</i>
<i>to upend people's expectations</i>

28:36.672 --> 28:39.885
and there's a little bit of tension
on the high wire act.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.928
Gaga, where are my flowers?

28:42.012 --> 28:44.055
<i>The chef I used to work for, David Bouley,</i>

28:44.139 --> 28:48.101
always said,
"If you're not about to maybe fall,

28:48.184 --> 28:49.770
then you're not really working,

28:49.853 --> 28:51.980
you're not really cooking,
you're not really creating,"

28:52.063 --> 28:53.940
and I believe in that.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.150
Come on, we gotta move!

28:55.233 --> 28:56.276
<i>I like the tension.</i>

28:56.359 --> 29:00.781
<i>The tension is where I think you can</i>
<i>really achieve some excitement.</i>

29:01.364 --> 29:03.324
That's it. That'll cook
while it's sitting in there, man.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.076
That's like... Come on, dude.
You don't have to-- Just--

29:05.160 --> 29:06.912
That's enough.
It's cooked. It's cooked.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.538
<i>When I was in my early 20s,</i>

29:08.621 --> 29:12.834
I got an internship at a restaurant
called Michel Rostang in Paris,

29:13.668 --> 29:15.837
<i>and I ended up getting inculcated</i>

29:15.921 --> 29:18.548
<i>in this rigor and the history</i>
<i>of French cooking</i>

29:18.631 --> 29:22.468
<i>and the tradition around food</i>
<i>and the obsession with quality,</i>

29:22.552 --> 29:24.805
<i>and that's when the bug, I think, hit.</i>

29:24.888 --> 29:26.097
[Dan] <i>Ordering Farmer's Feasts for two.</i>

29:26.181 --> 29:29.059
Two tomatoes. Two lobster.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.519
Two duck. Ending, two pig.

29:31.602 --> 29:32.603
[cooks] Yes!

29:32.687 --> 29:36.566
[Dan] <i>All French chefs of the old school</i>
<i>had huge tempers.</i>

29:36.649 --> 29:39.820
I've adopted from those experiences,

29:39.903 --> 29:42.989
a temper that
I'm just not proud of at all.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.365
[Dan] What is this?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.201
[cook] Just the one I made with chicken.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.161
Well, forget it.
Throw it away, man.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.789
Just forget it.
Throw the whole thing away.

29:50.872 --> 29:56.711
You know, to shout at cooks mercilessly,
it's not a good way to be successful.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.922
I know that, but I do have a temper,

29:59.005 --> 30:02.342
<i>and a really bad one</i>
<i>and one that I regret.</i>

30:02.425 --> 30:04.177
It looks like, just...
It looks like shit.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.636
Look at your fucking station.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.431
It's easy for me to say,
"Well, look at my history.

30:08.514 --> 30:11.226
It's the language that I learnt."

30:11.309 --> 30:16.106
<i>And to a certain extent, I believe that,</i>
<i>but I really do have to think about this</i>

30:16.189 --> 30:19.650
because I don't wanna be
the kind of chef that intimidates

30:19.734 --> 30:23.029
and acts in a way that's, uh...

30:25.031 --> 30:26.241
you know, that's just abhorrent.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.618
That's all, it's just abhorrent.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.536
So... I'm working on it.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.538
[Dan] Don't bang the pots, okay?
[cook 1] Yeah, okay.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.125
Don't bang the fucking pots.

30:36.501 --> 30:37.919
[cook 2] Where is he?

30:39.880 --> 30:41.214
[Dan] Ordering VIP ticket.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.175
Two tomato, two lobster,
two goose, two carbonara,

30:44.259 --> 30:46.761
two lamb belly,
and, ending, two pig tasting.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.138
[cooks] Yes!

30:48.221 --> 30:51.099
<i>Last night, a chef came in.</i>
<i>We were quite busy</i>

30:51.182 --> 30:53.684
<i>and I hopped off the line</i>
<i>to talk with him for a second.</i>

30:53.768 --> 30:55.770
He's like, "Wow, man. You still cook?"

30:55.854 --> 30:57.063
The off-the-cuff response is,

30:57.147 --> 30:59.440
"Of course I'm cooking.
That's what chefs do."

30:59.524 --> 31:01.817
And the other thing is like,
"He had a point to make.

31:02.610 --> 31:08.074
<i>Why haven't I set up two kitchens</i>
<i>where they truly run on their own?"</i>

31:08.158 --> 31:12.245
I mean, Michael here, along with
Adam and the rest of the team,

31:12.328 --> 31:13.746
they're very good.

31:13.829 --> 31:16.917
Extraordinarily talented
and driven themselves.

31:18.293 --> 31:22.881
<i>So why is it that I haven't figured out</i>
<i>a formula where I've extricated myself...</i>

31:24.049 --> 31:26.551
<i>from the daily rigors of the restaurant?</i>

31:26.634 --> 31:29.262
I think there's something there
that's driving me.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.932
It's not just because
I wanna drive the team.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.893
It also fulfills something in me
that I need, apparently.

31:40.231 --> 31:44.735
<i>There's one way to look at my life</i>
<i>as really exemplary</i>

31:44.819 --> 31:47.863
in the sense that we have two restaurants
that have been very successful,

31:47.948 --> 31:51.910
and then there's another way
to look at it. It's quite sad.

31:54.704 --> 31:57.540
<i>A lot of this work is the attempt</i>
<i>to fill some kind of sadness</i>

31:57.623 --> 32:02.212
<i>or something that I didn't</i>
<i>have in my life that I wish I had.</i>

32:02.295 --> 32:03.838
<i>Filling a void.</i>

32:07.592 --> 32:09.928
<i>I don't know that a mother...</i>

32:10.761 --> 32:14.765
dying when you're that age
ends up ever getting filled.

32:18.394 --> 32:19.562
<i>Are we doing a lot of this</i>

32:19.645 --> 32:23.984
<i>because we had this void in our life</i>
<i>we're trying to make up for?</i>

32:24.067 --> 32:25.568
<i>We build a restaurant.</i>

32:25.651 --> 32:28.029
<i>There's always this</i>
<i>unconscious thought of, like,</i>

32:28.113 --> 32:29.489
"Who's gonna
come into the restaurant?"

32:29.572 --> 32:33.743
So is building a restaurant a way
to get our mother back to the table,

32:33.826 --> 32:35.495
so to speak, you know?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.750
That could be part of it... yeah.

32:43.211 --> 32:47.090
<i>Isn't our life one attempt</i>
<i>to fill a void after another?</i>

32:49.300 --> 32:52.971
I don't know if I'm succeeding or not,
but I'm trying hard.

32:55.723 --> 33:01.479
<i>Who knows where this stuff originates</i>
<i>and where it ends and... I don't know.</i>

33:02.480 --> 33:05.025
There's a lifetime to work out here.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.192
[sighs]

33:08.528 --> 33:09.904
Oy.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.747
[Sean] <i>I started farming</i>
<i>about 13 years ago.</i>

33:19.830 --> 33:22.125
<i>I wanted to know more about food</i>
<i>and where it comes from.</i>

33:22.208 --> 33:26.046
<i>So I bought some meat chickens</i>
<i>and it sort of grew from there.</i>

33:27.005 --> 33:31.301
The average age of the American farmer
is in the 60s or something like that,

33:31.384 --> 33:33.844
which is a little bit ridiculous.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.932
<i>The toughest challenge is always gonna be</i>

33:38.016 --> 33:41.394
how to do what feels right
and what tastes good

33:41.477 --> 33:44.147
and isn't just about the bottom line.

33:47.192 --> 33:51.779
[Dan] <i>We have this great</i>
<i>milking operation going,</i>

33:51.862 --> 33:55.908
and suddenly,
we have males born on the farm.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.327
[Sean] They may go right past you.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.037
[Dan] <i>Now, I knew what a veal calf is,</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:00.996
<i>but I never put together</i>
<i>that if we have a dairy,</i>

34:01.081 --> 34:04.709
<i>we're gonna have to eventually</i>
<i>deal with the males that are born.</i>

34:04.792 --> 34:05.793
<i>They're not gonna be milked...</i>

34:05.876 --> 34:07.087
[Sean] That's not your mom.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.214
[Dan] <i>...and either they're gonna</i>
<i>become an asset to the farm</i>

34:09.297 --> 34:11.299
<i>or they're gonna become a liability,</i>

34:11.382 --> 34:12.675
and from a dairy perspective,

34:12.758 --> 34:16.512
the last thing you want
is a male sucking down your profits.

34:16.596 --> 34:19.307
Yes, the veal business
and the dairy business are--

34:19.390 --> 34:22.227
Other than the fact that
the veal calves come from a dairy,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.354
they're completely disconnected.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.857
The reputation of veal is terrible.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.609
It's of a tortured animal,

34:29.692 --> 34:31.236
<i>and for good reason.</i>

34:31.319 --> 34:35.781
<i>What most people do, 99%,</i>
<i>is you take the calf off the mother</i>

34:35.865 --> 34:40.035
and you feed it, you know, junk,

34:40.120 --> 34:44.624
and it gets very sick and
you have to intervene with antibiotics.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.084
<i>Conventional veal's white.</i>

34:46.167 --> 34:48.628
<i>It's blanch white</i>
<i>because the calves are anemic.</i>

34:48.711 --> 34:52.006
I can't eat that kind of veal.
I mean, I just like... Ugh.

34:53.007 --> 34:56.219
<i>So I started to realize,</i>
<i>"Okay, I gotta get with this veal</i>

34:56.302 --> 34:59.555
<i>if I really wanna support</i>
<i>the farm and the milk."</i>

34:59.639 --> 35:03.268
<i>And what Sean and I decided</i>
<i>was to push this for the menu,</i>

35:03.351 --> 35:05.353
<i>to create a revenue stream for the farm</i>

35:05.436 --> 35:10.108
and to humanely raise
a truly delicious, extraordinary veal.

35:11.192 --> 35:16.281
He's kept these calves on their mother
throughout the course of the day

35:16.364 --> 35:19.159
and they have free-choice milk.

35:19.242 --> 35:23.413
Conventional veal versus veal
that's on pasture and on its mother...

35:23.496 --> 35:24.997
it's a different product.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.499
<i>It's another world.</i>

35:27.750 --> 35:30.795
<i>The highest order of humaneness</i>
<i>produces the best flavor,</i>

35:30.878 --> 35:36.259
<i>and it pushes me and the chefs here</i>
<i>to reinvent the menu constantly.</i>

35:37.092 --> 35:39.053
[indistinct]

35:39.137 --> 35:42.598
[Sean] <i>My hope is that people</i>
<i>will start to recognize flavor</i>

35:42.682 --> 35:43.933
and they're like,
"Oh, my God,

35:44.016 --> 35:46.227
I didn't realize that food
could taste this good,"

35:46.311 --> 35:47.603
and they change the way they eat

35:47.687 --> 35:50.981
<i>and it's a life-changing experience.</i>

35:51.065 --> 35:53.067
[cook] <i>Pick up, two toasts!</i>
[all] <i>Yes!</i>

35:55.403 --> 35:57.947
-Two marmalade on the fly, now!
-[cook] Yes!

35:59.865 --> 36:01.326
-Forty-two.
-Forty-two.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.453
-Exact, okay.
-Right.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.581
Thirty-two. Come on, come on,
come on, come on! Pick up!

36:18.008 --> 36:20.803
We're headed to Mott Street.

36:20.886 --> 36:25.015
I haven't been to this spot in...
yeah, 15 years.

36:26.141 --> 36:30.271
I sort of stayed away
because I think it brings back...

36:33.023 --> 36:34.650
bad juju.

36:37.445 --> 36:41.991
<i>In 1997, when I ended up</i>
<i>coming back from France,</i>

36:42.074 --> 36:44.410
<i>I had this catering company started.</i>

36:44.494 --> 36:48.080
<i>I was doing an event every week.</i>

36:48.163 --> 36:51.000
I was desperately trying to
make a go of it, of the catering.

36:53.085 --> 36:56.381
<i>I was preparing a wedding for 300 people.</i>

36:56.464 --> 37:00.676
I was in this ridiculously
illegal kitchen in Chinatown,

37:00.760 --> 37:04.138
<i>just below ground,</i>
<i>had no ventilation for the stove.</i>

37:04.222 --> 37:06.474
Right down in here.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.894
It's, like, the most illegal kitchen
in the history of the world.

37:09.977 --> 37:12.522
To ventilate, I kept the thing open.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.149
This was a snail-cleaning operation.

37:15.233 --> 37:20.446
So every time he washed out the snails,
to clean the dirty water,

37:20.530 --> 37:25.243
it would just completely flood my kitchen.
It was so fucking crazy.

37:26.160 --> 37:30.080
<i>It was, like, 4:00 in the morning</i>
<i>and I was just making the dessert soup,</i>

37:30.164 --> 37:35.002
<i>and I was like, "I'm gonna run out</i>
<i>and just get a snack at the corner."</i>

37:35.085 --> 37:36.921
I closed the door
to my kitchen downstairs,

37:37.004 --> 37:42.593
I went up to the sidewalk and I realized
that the door had locked behind me.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.684
<i>Then I started having, like,</i>
<i>these visions of firefighters coming.</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:52.395
<i>My whole mindset</i>
<i>was that this was so illegal.</i>

37:52.478 --> 37:54.605
<i>"I'd be in jail,"</i>
<i>that's what I kept thinking.</i>

37:54.689 --> 37:56.231
So I was just like,
"Who the hell am I gonna call?

37:56.316 --> 37:59.109
Who am I gonna scream to
because of the illegality of it?"

38:02.697 --> 38:06.826
I just... I like... I had,
what I guess one would say... I lost it.

38:06.909 --> 38:10.037
I just, physically, I lost it
and I got this itching attack.

38:13.666 --> 38:18.170
<i>It was just the weirdest</i>
<i>physical manifestation of pain.</i>

38:18.253 --> 38:22.508
<i>I was in this, like, crouched position,</i>
<i>itching, itching, itching, itching.</i>

38:22.592 --> 38:24.844
<i>Nothing could have been worse.</i>

38:26.220 --> 38:29.557
<i>All of a sudden, this guy touched me</i>
<i>and was like, "You okay, man?"</i>

38:29.640 --> 38:31.476
<i>Like, "What's going on?"</i>

38:31.559 --> 38:33.353
<i>I think I was crying.</i>

38:34.645 --> 38:38.107
<i>I've not felt more</i>
<i>depleted or low in a moment.</i>

38:38.190 --> 38:40.818
Every chef I know that's successful

38:40.901 --> 38:43.946
has had moments
of just really intense failure.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.452
<i>Failure is very important.</i>

38:49.535 --> 38:55.165
It introduces you to an idea
that you don't ever wanna return to.

38:58.503 --> 39:02.297
Hang on a second. No, no, no, no.
Real nice, man. Real nice.

39:04.967 --> 39:07.177
Okay. Forty-three's first pick up.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.596
[cook 1] Yes.
[cook 2] Yes.

39:15.395 --> 39:17.980
[Dan] Where did this start?
What are you doing? What's going on?

39:18.063 --> 39:21.984
So, the two things we try to do
are to either remove the heat completely

39:22.067 --> 39:24.737
or to be able to just set
an upper threshold limit.

39:24.820 --> 39:29.033
[Dan] <i>We need to look at modernity</i>
<i>and science when it comes to flavor.</i>

39:29.116 --> 39:32.495
That is the future of really great cooking
and really great farming.

39:32.578 --> 39:35.540
And so, what we are working to do
is take some of these paprika types

39:35.623 --> 39:37.833
and cross them with peppers
that really excel here,

39:37.917 --> 39:39.877
-that ripen really early.
-Nice.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.546
[Mazourek] It might be hot.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.088
[all laughing]

39:43.172 --> 39:44.256
[Mazourek] Okay?

39:45.716 --> 39:47.760
[Michael] Is it a hot one or a sweet one?

39:49.178 --> 39:51.556
My mouth is a three-alarm fire right now.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.724
[laughing continues]

39:53.808 --> 39:54.809
[Dan] Okay.

39:56.143 --> 39:59.939
Can you show us the red peppers
you're developing for these special eggs,

40:00.022 --> 40:01.399
these red pepper eggs?

40:01.482 --> 40:03.358
[Dan] <i>We came up with the idea of</i>
<i>pureeing peppers</i>

40:03.443 --> 40:05.110
<i>and feeding them to chickens.</i>

40:05.194 --> 40:08.573
<i>Mike wanted to breed us</i>
<i>a pepper at a concentrate.</i>

40:08.656 --> 40:13.077
<i>The diet for the chicken would allow</i>
<i>for the yolk to be truly a red egg yolk.</i>

40:13.160 --> 40:15.580
[Mazourek] They'll have about
10 times the red pigment.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.165
[Dan] No shit. No shit.
God, that's awesome.

40:18.248 --> 40:20.334
<i>The famous Michael Pollan expression is,</i>
<i>"You are what you eat,</i>

40:20.418 --> 40:22.587
<i>but you are what you eat eats, too."</i>

40:22.670 --> 40:26.006
We have the opportunity here
to put that into action,

40:26.090 --> 40:29.760
to get people to think about
not just what they're eating

40:29.844 --> 40:31.929
but what they're eating is eating.

40:32.346 --> 40:36.141
<i>Why would you waste</i>
<i>a perfectly great pepper on a chicken</i>

40:36.225 --> 40:37.977
<i>instead of feeding it to people?</i>

40:38.060 --> 40:40.145
[Mazourek] Peppers evolved
to be eaten by birds.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.439
So all the really hot ones--

40:41.522 --> 40:43.941
-[woman] They can't taste the capsaicin.
-Yeah, they can't taste it.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.693
So it's actually...

40:45.776 --> 40:48.779
It's the natural system
of birds eating peppers.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.740
-Whoa! [imitates exploding]
-It's the natural system.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.908
[woman] Which came first?
[Dan] I love that.

40:52.992 --> 40:56.245
[Dan] <i>Mike came here for dinner.</i>
<i>I had a butternut squash.</i>

40:56.328 --> 41:00.374
<i>I was like, "Mike, why don't you</i>
<i>breed a squash that has a lot more flavor</i>

41:00.458 --> 41:02.793
<i>and shrink the thing</i>
<i>and get the water out of it?"</i>

41:02.877 --> 41:04.378
He looked at me
and I'll never forget it.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.548
He adjusted his glasses like this,
he looked up to me and he said,

41:07.632 --> 41:12.386
"In all my years of breeding, no one
has ever asked me to breed for flavor."

41:12.470 --> 41:16.390
It's something that really, as a breeder,
you're really discouraged from working on.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.560
Everything is supposed to fit
this one uniform size,

41:19.644 --> 41:21.979
this conception
of what the produce should be,

41:22.062 --> 41:23.814
<i>and so this relationship,</i>

41:23.898 --> 41:26.066
<i>the beautiful thing is</i>
<i>it's really set us free.</i>

41:26.150 --> 41:27.818
[Dan] <i>Yeah, he ran with it</i>
<i>and then four years later,</i>

41:27.902 --> 41:31.739
<i>here we are with</i>
<i>this new variety of squash.</i>

41:31.822 --> 41:34.492
It's just amazingly delicious.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.787
The flavor's more concentrated.
It's sweeter.

41:37.870 --> 41:39.329
It's more complex.
It's not just sweetness.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.957
<i>And it just blows away</i>
<i>people in the dining room.</i>

41:43.417 --> 41:44.752
<i>I look at my challenge</i>

41:44.835 --> 41:48.297
<i>as creating that cuisine</i>
<i>around the things that I believe in.</i>

41:48.380 --> 41:52.927
I want the pieces to come together
and I want more farms and more diversity.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.555
<i>I'd like to keep pushing.</i>

41:55.638 --> 41:58.933
<i>How do we think about this</i>
<i>20 years down the road</i>

41:59.016 --> 42:00.184
<i>and how do you put this together</i>

42:00.267 --> 42:03.604
in a way that speaks to
a true Hudson Valley cuisine?

42:05.439 --> 42:08.526
<i>That's where we're headed.</i>
<i>It's a lot of work.</i>

42:09.318 --> 42:10.820
A lot of work.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.489
<i>It takes a lot of time</i>
<i>and a lot of devotion.</i>

42:21.413 --> 42:25.042
<i>I was 43 when I had Edith, my daughter.</i>

42:25.125 --> 42:27.837
<i>Anyone can have a family</i>
<i>and raise children.</i>

42:27.920 --> 42:30.673
<i>The question is--</i>
<i>You wanna do it in a way that, like...</i>

42:30.756 --> 42:32.883
people are reasonably happy.
[laughs]

42:32.967 --> 42:37.805
Part of that requires time and investment
in the same way that the kitchen does.

42:38.764 --> 42:41.308
[Dan] One more slide and then we gotta go.

42:44.478 --> 42:45.520
Oop! Okay.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.022
[Aria] Ready?

42:52.778 --> 42:54.113
[Dan] <i>I was attracted to cooking</i>

42:54.196 --> 42:59.076
<i>'cause it's so beautiful</i>
<i>when you look at it from afar.</i>

42:59.159 --> 43:01.453
What I didn't understand
when I was looking at the beauty

43:01.536 --> 43:04.081
is just how torturous it is, and...

43:05.875 --> 43:09.128
and that's a lesson learned late.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.633
<i>It's still so difficult.</i>

43:13.716 --> 43:17.637
<i>I still feel the sort of sadness.</i>

43:17.720 --> 43:22.975
I feel this extreme sadness
when I'm not with her on a Sunday...

43:23.058 --> 43:24.184
like yesterday.

43:25.310 --> 43:27.021
<i>I know that I'm not</i>
<i>gonna get that time back.</i>

43:27.104 --> 43:30.107
It's prosaic to say that, but it's...

43:30.190 --> 43:33.027
When you're actually living in it,
it feels-- I feel a lot of pain.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.111
Bye, Edith.

43:34.194 --> 43:36.071
-Bye, Daddy.
-Bye.

43:36.155 --> 43:39.909
First time she's putting words together,
and starting to form a sentence,

43:39.992 --> 43:42.452
you're like,
"Fuck, I missed that, dude!"

43:42.536 --> 43:44.079
[laughing]

43:44.163 --> 43:47.416
Anyway... I'm gonna spend
some time with her tomorrow.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.469
<i>It's really the existence of being a chef.</i>
<i>You have this crazy life.</i>

43:59.553 --> 44:01.138
This is an absolutely crazy life,

44:01.221 --> 44:04.684
the hours, intensity, pressure,

44:04.767 --> 44:08.979
<i>and the brink of failure</i>
<i>that is just constant.</i>

44:09.063 --> 44:11.606
[David] <i>Being a leader,</i>
<i>there's a high expectation</i>

44:11.691 --> 44:15.360
<i>and I think that became a calling</i>
<i>that made it clear to him</i>

44:15.444 --> 44:19.114
<i>that the work he had in front of him</i>
<i>was probably vastly different</i>

44:19.198 --> 44:22.409
from what he might have imagined
when he started cooking.

44:22.492 --> 44:25.746
This breeding experiment
is not about us just tasting something.

44:25.830 --> 44:29.541
"Oh, I like that wheat,"
or, "Oh, I like that squash."

44:29.624 --> 44:32.544
I think the more productive
use of our time

44:32.627 --> 44:36.841
is to go straight to the breeder
and help them realize our goals.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.383
<i>That's the trick to all of this.</i>

44:38.467 --> 44:42.429
He has very knowingly
taken on the responsibility

44:42.512 --> 44:48.060
<i>of becoming the voice</i>
<i>for the ethical restaurateur.</i>

44:48.143 --> 44:49.770
[Dan] I'm here to introduce
your next course.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.480
<i>Chefs play a huge role.</i>

44:51.563 --> 44:53.648
We have this power now
that we never had.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.235
<i>We can introduce change for the good.</i>

44:56.318 --> 44:57.820
A breeder by the name of Steve Jones

44:57.903 --> 45:02.032
is breeding some of the best wheats
of the future for flavor.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.951
Which is why I'm so excited about wheat

45:04.034 --> 45:07.287
as one of the answers
to looking at this holistically.

45:07.371 --> 45:11.291
We need to breed the bran
for flavor and for functionality.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.127
That's where it's at.

45:13.210 --> 45:16.130
[whistles]
They drunk off that.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.924
This is new. This is like--
This is the future. Revolution.

45:19.008 --> 45:22.427
I'd love people to leave here and
think that they've connected with nature,

45:22.511 --> 45:25.765
and it sounds fucking weird
when I say that, but I really mean it.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.432
Well, it's 100% whole wheat.

45:27.516 --> 45:29.935
This isn't, [mocking] "Oh,
whole wheat croissant, it's 10%."

45:30.019 --> 45:31.520
100%.

45:31.603 --> 45:34.356
And so here, we gotta pass this around.
Grab a bite of them.

45:34.439 --> 45:37.526
The role of the menu
is to put the pieces back together,

45:37.609 --> 45:41.030
<i>and we can do that</i>
<i>through what the land provides.</i>

45:41.113 --> 45:42.865
[Dan] Right? It's good.

45:42.948 --> 45:43.949
-Really.
-Wow! I'm blown away.

45:44.033 --> 45:45.200
That's delicious.

45:45.284 --> 45:47.536
It's not at all what I expected.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.830
[Dan] <i>That's the gift of nature, really.</i>

45:49.914 --> 45:54.251
When you treat nature well,
it gives you the gift of great food.

45:57.129 --> 46:02.717
[Ruth] <i>I am actually very hopeful</i>
<i>about the sustainable food movement.</i>

46:02.802 --> 46:06.138
<i>We now have a generation</i>
<i>of young people</i>

46:06.221 --> 46:08.598
who understand
that eating is an ethical act

46:08.682 --> 46:12.102
<i>in a way that</i>
<i>no previous generation ever did.</i>

46:13.062 --> 46:17.149
So I feel like the challenge for
this whole deal, for my lifetime really,

46:17.232 --> 46:20.652
<i>is turning our expectation</i>
<i>for dinner on its head.</i>

46:24.323 --> 46:28.410
<i>How can I create a dish around veal</i>
<i>or Mike Mazourek's squashes...</i>

46:28.493 --> 46:30.037
The future's gonna be great.

46:30.120 --> 46:34.041
<i>...or Klaas' lowly grains and</i>
<i>leguminous crops?</i>

46:34.124 --> 46:36.210
[Klaas] There's likely to be
a very impressive crop here.

46:37.502 --> 46:40.089
[Dan] <i>How do you create dishes</i>
<i>like Rotation Risotto</i>

46:40.172 --> 46:42.925
<i>that become important</i>
<i>to someone to repeat?</i>

46:44.927 --> 46:46.136
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

46:46.220 --> 46:50.140
<i>What if you had, like all cuisines,</i>
<i>200 of those kinds of dishes?</i>

46:54.103 --> 46:57.272
<i>And what if people started</i>
<i>requesting them over and over again?</i>

46:57.356 --> 46:59.233
<i>Does it become a cuisine</i>
<i>in my lifetime?</i>

46:59.316 --> 47:01.526
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but as Wes Jackson likes to say,</i>

47:01.610 --> 47:04.238
"If you're thinking about an idea
that you can solve in your lifetime,

47:04.321 --> 47:06.240
you're thinking too small."

47:06.823 --> 47:10.077
<i>That gives me great hope</i>
<i>and also great energy...</i>

47:11.078 --> 47:14.039
<i>because I don't know where else</i>
<i>all of these ideas come together.</i>

47:14.123 --> 47:15.540
<i>If you're a nutritionist,</i>

47:15.624 --> 47:18.460
<i>you're looking at this</i>
<i>from a very myopic view.</i>

47:18.543 --> 47:20.004
<i>It's an important one, but it's myopic.</i>

47:20.087 --> 47:23.340
<i>If you're an agricultural economist,</i>
<i>you have a different view of it.</i>

47:23.423 --> 47:25.968
