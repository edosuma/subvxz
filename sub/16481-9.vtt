WEBVTT

00:02.672 --> 00:04.108
(call button buzzing)

00:04.108 --> 00:05.979
Nurse Hoffel was
pretty adamant

00:05.979 --> 00:08.250
about us working the
night shift tonight.

00:08.250 --> 00:09.520
(call buttons buzzing,
phones ringing)

00:09.520 --> 00:10.688
Where's Zayday?

00:10.688 --> 00:11.924
Why doesn't she
have to work, too?

00:11.924 --> 00:13.360
I don't know.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.632
She hasn't slept in her
bed in, like, two days.

00:15.632 --> 00:18.136
Wait...
Zayday lives with us?

00:26.119 --> 00:29.125
Okay, time to check your blo...

00:29.125 --> 00:30.294
(gasps)

00:35.505 --> 00:37.842
(screams)

00:40.147 --> 00:42.151
(screams)

00:42.151 --> 00:44.155
(screams)

00:45.190 --> 00:47.094
(all screaming)

00:47.094 --> 00:48.196
What the hell is this?

00:48.196 --> 00:50.200
What do you think it is?!

00:50.200 --> 00:51.937
It's the Green Meanie
trying to scare us,

00:51.937 --> 00:53.674
so we're all freaked out
right before he attacks us.

00:53.674 --> 00:54.676
That makes zero sense.

00:54.676 --> 00:55.745
With our adrenaline flowing,

00:55.745 --> 00:56.747
we'd be, like,
ten times faster

00:56.747 --> 00:58.116
and stronger
and more alert.

00:58.116 --> 01:00.087
Does anyone else find it weird
that that Chanel mannequin

01:00.087 --> 01:01.155
is dressed like a Kappa sister?

01:02.391 --> 01:04.730
I get why the
Green Meanie

01:04.730 --> 01:06.232
would fill this bed
with swamp goo,

01:06.232 --> 01:08.638
I mean, totally
in his milieu,

01:08.638 --> 01:11.209
but the Kappa stuff,
very out of character,

01:11.209 --> 01:12.979
very two years ago.

01:13.981 --> 01:14.983
We need to split up.

01:14.983 --> 01:16.085
It's one against three.

01:16.085 --> 01:17.354
He can't chase us all down

01:17.354 --> 01:18.356
before we escape.

01:18.356 --> 01:20.027
I mean, yes, one of us

01:20.027 --> 01:21.496
will probably die and, yes,

01:21.496 --> 01:23.199
it'll probably be Number Five
because the joints

01:23.199 --> 01:25.070
in her lower body don't seem
to move when she runs,

01:25.070 --> 01:27.274
but I am willing
to make that sacrifice.

01:27.274 --> 01:28.577
Me, too.

01:28.577 --> 01:29.880
Last one to the Starbucks

01:29.880 --> 01:31.015
down the street buys lattes.

01:31.015 --> 01:32.117
The last one to the Starbucks

01:32.117 --> 01:33.119
down the street is dead.

01:33.119 --> 01:34.288
(whimpers)

01:34.288 --> 01:35.290
(whimpers)

01:41.804 --> 01:43.273
(screams)

01:49.720 --> 01:51.155
(screams)

01:55.898 --> 01:58.236
(screams)

01:58.236 --> 02:01.109
(screams)

02:01.109 --> 02:02.946
Help, he's right behind me.

02:02.946 --> 02:05.250
I don't want to die
in this outfit!

02:05.250 --> 02:07.187
Run, he's coming!

02:08.256 --> 02:09.526
(screams)

02:13.066 --> 02:14.101
(screams)

02:17.976 --> 02:19.378
CHANEL #5:
Look! Hurry, he's coming!

02:19.378 --> 02:20.380
(screams)

02:22.284 --> 02:23.286
(gasps)

02:25.323 --> 02:26.660
(gasps)

02:46.499 --> 02:48.804
(gasping)

02:52.277 --> 02:54.315
No, please,
I hate this hospital, too!

02:55.116 --> 02:57.120
(Chanel shouts)

03:09.679 --> 03:12.585
Oh!

03:12.585 --> 03:15.524
Well... they all got away.

03:15.524 --> 03:17.094
You guys ruined everything.

03:17.094 --> 03:19.164
Us?
Yes.

03:19.164 --> 03:20.300
I set this
whole thing up

03:20.300 --> 03:21.603
by making the
Chanels work late

03:21.603 --> 03:22.705
and then you're bogarting

03:22.705 --> 03:24.809
my revenge murders.

03:24.809 --> 03:26.012
Wait a minute.

03:26.012 --> 03:27.347
Aren't you the
hairball guy?

03:27.347 --> 03:28.851
Mm‐hmm.
What the hell
are you doing here?

03:28.851 --> 03:30.220
Wait, what happened?

03:30.220 --> 03:31.389
I told you to stay
away from Chanel #3.

03:31.389 --> 03:32.558
No, no, wait, no, no, no.
Wah‐wah.

03:32.558 --> 03:34.161
You are not the boss
of who she gets to kill.

03:34.161 --> 03:35.297
HOFFEL: Oh, you look
like a pickle!
(whistles)

03:40.373 --> 03:44.415
Looks like we're gonna need
to call a Green Meanie Summit.

03:49.224 --> 03:51.530
ANNOUNCER:
<i>It's</i> Lovin' the D

03:51.530 --> 03:55.003
<i>with your host,</i>
<i>Dr. Scarlett Lovin.</i>

03:58.877 --> 04:00.113
Thank you, thank you.

04:00.113 --> 04:03.988
Hello and welcome
to <i>Lovin' the D.</i>

04:03.988 --> 04:05.357
I'm Dr. Scarlett Lovin.

04:05.357 --> 04:07.628
Today we have
a very special guest.

04:07.628 --> 04:09.231
His name is Garrett.

04:09.231 --> 04:12.204
His is a story of bravery
and perseverance.

04:12.204 --> 04:13.406
Truly, he's an inspiration...

04:13.406 --> 04:14.475
Oh, my God.

04:14.475 --> 04:16.178
I love this show!
Shh!

04:16.178 --> 04:18.584
Let's bring him out.
I don't get it, though.

04:18.584 --> 04:20.186
Why do they call it
<i>Lovin' the D?</i>

04:20.186 --> 04:21.188
What?

04:21.188 --> 04:22.592
The "D" stands for doctor.

04:22.592 --> 04:23.727
She's Dr. Scarlett Lovin.

04:23.727 --> 04:25.397
<i>Lovin' the D</i> as in doctor.

04:25.397 --> 04:27.267
CHANEL #5: But why don't
they just call the show

04:27.267 --> 04:28.336
Lovin' the Doctor?

04:28.336 --> 04:30.173
Shut up, Number Five!

04:30.173 --> 04:32.244
God, I wish I was
Dr. Scarlett Lovin.

04:32.244 --> 04:33.179
Well, yeah, we all wish

04:33.179 --> 04:34.516
we were Dr. Scarlett Lovin.

04:34.516 --> 04:37.087
I mean, she's the
queen of daytime TV.

04:37.087 --> 04:39.425
She's a hot doctor
with her own TV show

04:39.425 --> 04:42.064
and she's a former Kappa sister.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.867
She's basically us.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.907
Do you think we should tell
someone that there are

04:46.907 --> 04:48.877
at least two Green Meanies
trying to kill everyone?

04:48.877 --> 04:50.080
I told Nurse Hoffel.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.718
She said she would handle it.

04:52.718 --> 04:55.156
So, another thing
I had to take care of.

04:55.156 --> 04:57.461
You're welcome!

04:57.461 --> 04:59.566
Oh... Chanels.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.168
Um, this is

05:01.168 --> 05:03.172
Arthur Annenburg.
He is the editor

05:03.172 --> 05:04.776
of <i>The Northeast</i>
<i>Journal of Medicine.</i>

05:04.776 --> 05:06.212
Didn't we already
have a reporter

05:06.212 --> 05:07.380
from <i>The Northeast</i>
<i>Journal of Medicine?</i>

05:07.380 --> 05:09.118
Yes, his name
is Slade Hornborn

05:09.118 --> 05:10.588
and he's gone missing.

05:10.588 --> 05:12.558
That's one of the
reasons why I'm here.

05:12.558 --> 05:14.128
And...

05:14.128 --> 05:15.463
I'm not a reporter.

05:15.463 --> 05:17.467
I'm the journal's editor,

05:17.467 --> 05:19.939
and also a
practicing surgeon

05:19.939 --> 05:21.710
and an adjunct
board member

05:21.710 --> 05:23.947
of the American
Medical Association.

05:23.947 --> 05:27.087
Do you also have a PhD
in bragging, Dr. Annenburg?

05:27.087 --> 05:29.324
Yes, sick burn,
Number Three.

05:29.324 --> 05:30.493
Before his disappearance,

05:30.493 --> 05:32.497
Mr. Hornborn
had stumbled upon

05:32.497 --> 05:35.003
some unorthodox
practices here

05:35.003 --> 05:36.138
at the C.U.R.E. Institute

05:36.138 --> 05:37.808
that I'm here
to follow up on.

05:37.808 --> 05:40.246
Um, if I may.

05:40.246 --> 05:42.117
ANNENBURG:
<i>They're med students,</i>

05:42.117 --> 05:43.687
I presume?
Of course.

05:43.687 --> 05:45.190
I'll need to see
their credentials.

05:45.190 --> 05:46.927
Um...
(clears throat)

05:46.927 --> 05:49.097
...I'm sorry, what?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.505
Undergraduate
transcripts,

05:52.505 --> 05:53.540
MCATs.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.544
What? What's an MCAT?

05:55.544 --> 05:57.314
Medical College
Admission Test.

05:57.314 --> 05:59.318
We get it,
you're real smart.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.088
I will handle this.

06:01.088 --> 06:02.725
Um...

06:02.725 --> 06:04.562
I'm not sure
if you're aware,

06:04.562 --> 06:07.167
but at the Institute
we take a...

06:07.167 --> 06:10.808
more fluid approach
to higher learning.

06:10.808 --> 06:13.412
Are you familiar
with the Montessori method?

06:13.412 --> 06:15.016
Admitting
improperly credentialed

06:15.016 --> 06:18.022
med school applicants
is a brazen violation

06:18.022 --> 06:20.426
of ethical standards.

06:20.426 --> 06:21.796
Arthur...

06:23.132 --> 06:25.804
... of course the girls
took the MCATs.

06:25.804 --> 06:28.042
I just think that, uh,

06:28.042 --> 06:31.215
it was probably not memorable
for them because

06:31.215 --> 06:33.687
(whispering):
they found the test so easy.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.632
Why don't I, uh, get you
the transcripts?

06:39.632 --> 06:41.168
Come on.
Um...

06:41.168 --> 06:43.874
you know what,
I'll be right back.

06:43.874 --> 06:45.678
I just forgot something.

06:47.213 --> 06:48.884
(whispering):
You are taking the MCATs.

06:48.884 --> 06:50.086
No questions asked.

06:50.086 --> 06:51.155
What? No!
Why?

06:51.155 --> 06:53.059
We're not taking
that stupid test.

06:53.059 --> 06:55.864
We want to be TV doctors,
not real doctors.

06:55.864 --> 06:57.568
(whispering):
You are doing it.

06:57.568 --> 06:59.171
Coming.

06:59.171 --> 07:01.175
CHANEL:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

07:01.175 --> 07:02.712
I can't believe it.

07:02.712 --> 07:03.947
Am I dreaming?
Someone wake me up.

07:03.947 --> 07:05.216
There's no way
this is actually happening.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.185
Please, tell me I'm having
a heart attack.

07:06.185 --> 07:08.155
No freaking way, I...

07:08.155 --> 07:09.324
I don't deserve this.

07:09.324 --> 07:10.460
(crying):
Stupid little me

07:10.460 --> 07:12.030
doesn't deserve this.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.167
MUNSCH:
Girls, allow me to introduce you

07:14.167 --> 07:16.171
to Dr. Scarlett Lovin.

07:16.171 --> 07:17.340
Yeah, we know who she is!
Do you think
we're idiots?

07:17.340 --> 07:20.213
Ladies, Dr. Holt...

07:21.181 --> 07:22.250
...it is such a pleasure

07:22.250 --> 07:23.252
to meet you.

07:23.252 --> 07:24.421
What...

07:24.421 --> 07:25.691
glorious circumstances

07:25.691 --> 07:27.227
brought you to us?

07:27.227 --> 07:31.201
This is, uh, my producer,
Lenk Van D'Vlonne.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.605
Lenk was, uh,

07:32.605 --> 07:33.874
doing some research
for our show

07:33.874 --> 07:35.109
and told me about

07:35.109 --> 07:37.447
the parasitic twin
surgery you performed

07:37.447 --> 07:40.621
and I was absolutely
blown away.

07:40.621 --> 07:42.257
Oh, my God, thank you!
I can't believe
this is happening.

07:42.257 --> 07:44.695
I hate to be a
squeaky wheel, but...

07:44.695 --> 07:46.566
I was the one who did
most of the surgery.

07:49.705 --> 07:51.543
You absolutely did

07:51.543 --> 07:56.218
and it was the most spectacular
surgery of the last 25 years.

07:56.218 --> 07:57.287
That is why

07:57.287 --> 07:59.391
I want you four

07:59.391 --> 08:00.694
to perform a surgery,

08:00.694 --> 08:02.230
live on television

08:02.230 --> 08:04.367
for a special episode
of <i>Lovin' the D.</i>

08:04.367 --> 08:05.704
(screams)
(cries)

08:08.442 --> 08:09.545
Garrett has

08:09.545 --> 08:10.781
a 16‐pound tumor

08:10.781 --> 08:11.883
on his face.

08:11.883 --> 08:14.254
Dr. Holt, you will remove it

08:14.254 --> 08:16.091
and the Chanels will assist you.

08:16.091 --> 08:19.197
(Chanels shouting "yes"
over and over)

08:19.197 --> 08:24.207
The first live surgery in the
history of daytime television.

08:24.207 --> 08:26.311
You see, ladies, Dr. Holt,

08:26.311 --> 08:30.554
there's something we
in showbiz call "it.".

08:30.554 --> 08:32.223
And you four,

08:32.223 --> 08:34.261
you got it.

08:34.261 --> 08:35.564
All right,
just a couple things here.

08:35.564 --> 08:37.233
First of all,
this is a very complicated

08:37.233 --> 08:40.774
and dangerous procedure and
the Chanels aren't doctors.

08:40.774 --> 08:41.976
They're not even
real medical students.

08:41.976 --> 08:43.279
(gasps)

08:43.279 --> 08:45.016
CHANEL (whispering):
Shut up.

08:45.016 --> 08:47.186
Really? Hmm, uh...

08:47.186 --> 08:48.155
(under breath):
that's, uh...

08:48.155 --> 08:49.592
What are you doing?
We need them.

08:49.592 --> 08:50.761
Who's "we"?

08:50.761 --> 08:53.934
The C.U.R.E. Institute
needs them.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.771
That jerk from <i>The Northeast</i>
<i>Journal of Medicine</i>

08:55.771 --> 08:57.808
is so far up my grill‐‐

08:57.808 --> 09:00.714
high‐profile surgery,
this one on TV‐‐

09:00.714 --> 09:02.150
it would make
it impossible

09:02.150 --> 09:04.087
for them to close
these doors.

09:04.087 --> 09:05.423
I'm sorry.

09:05.423 --> 09:07.060
We are, uh, concerned

09:07.060 --> 09:10.066
with <i>Lovin' the D's</i>
legal exposure.

09:10.066 --> 09:11.603
LENK:
If we were to say
the Chanels were

09:11.603 --> 09:12.805
medical students
when they are not,

09:12.805 --> 09:14.240
Lovin' the D Productions

09:14.240 --> 09:15.611
could face a lawsuit.

09:15.611 --> 09:17.013
Of course.

09:17.013 --> 09:19.250
We'll take the MCATs.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.286
Yeah! Why not?

09:20.286 --> 09:22.256
We're fine with it.
We'll take the MCATs.

09:22.256 --> 09:24.094
I couldn't agree more.
I, for one, can't wait.

09:24.094 --> 09:25.262
Uh, we can take them
somewhere today.

09:25.262 --> 09:26.264
Is there, is there a place?

09:26.264 --> 09:27.668
Um, uh... the DMV?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.639
Great.

09:29.639 --> 09:30.607
(chuckles)

09:30.607 --> 09:32.210
We'll get back to you

09:32.210 --> 09:34.447
and as soon as
the test scores come in,

09:34.447 --> 09:36.619
we'll do the surgery.

09:36.619 --> 09:37.821
Good luck, ladies.

09:37.821 --> 09:39.659
(cries)
(sighs)

09:39.659 --> 09:41.829
Hear ye, hear ye.

09:41.829 --> 09:45.136
The inaugural Green Meanie
Summit has come to order.

09:45.136 --> 09:46.238
Now...

09:46.238 --> 09:47.407
we are here to review

09:47.407 --> 09:48.810
the past and future kills,

09:48.810 --> 09:50.046
and divvy up
the remaining murders,

09:50.046 --> 09:52.083
so that no one's feelings
get hurt.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.853
And as someone
who has orchestrated

09:53.853 --> 09:56.726
a mass murder before,
I am happy to adjudicate.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.429
Oh, and I‐I promise
to be impartial,

09:58.429 --> 10:00.901
but, no spoiler here...
Wes is my dad.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.871
Wait, what?
Seriously?

10:02.871 --> 10:03.873
That's right.
HESTER:
Yeah, it's real.

10:03.873 --> 10:05.109
Believe me,

10:05.109 --> 10:06.946
I was as surprised as you
when I found out.

10:06.946 --> 10:08.449
Okay!

10:08.449 --> 10:10.854
We're just gonna run
through a little review here

10:10.854 --> 10:12.256
so that we're all
on the same page

10:12.256 --> 10:14.094
with a segment
that I like to call...

10:15.463 --> 10:17.100
..."Who Killed Who?"

10:17.100 --> 10:18.102
Segment?

10:18.102 --> 10:19.104
Wait, is this like a game show?

10:19.104 --> 10:21.141
Wolf Lady.

10:21.141 --> 10:22.911
That was me.
(bell dings)

10:22.911 --> 10:24.749
And... Tyler.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.751
Also me.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.621
(bell dings)

10:27.621 --> 10:28.556
Randal.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.092
Me. Douche.
(bell dings)

10:30.092 --> 10:31.562
Winning this one.

10:31.562 --> 10:32.765
Um, what about Sheila?

10:32.765 --> 10:35.302
Oh, that was me.
Finally.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.672
Yeah. I arrived in town
earlier that day

10:36.672 --> 10:39.110
from the Stanford Insane Asylum
visiting Grace,

10:39.110 --> 10:40.346
so I was super pissed.

10:40.346 --> 10:42.183
I killed Sheila but I ran off

10:42.183 --> 10:43.953
when I saw Zayday because her
and Grace were like...

10:43.953 --> 10:45.256
(chuckles)
they're like besties.

10:45.256 --> 10:46.692
Oh, I also killed, um...

10:46.692 --> 10:48.295
yeah, the candy striper.
(dings)

10:48.295 --> 10:51.034
The chubby guy.

10:51.034 --> 10:52.436
Who killed Chad Radwell?

10:53.438 --> 10:54.675
(dings)
Me!

10:54.675 --> 10:57.280
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah,

10:57.280 --> 10:58.650
and I also poisoned
the apple bobbing water

10:58.650 --> 10:59.952
at the Halloween party.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.488
And I attacked Number Five,

11:01.488 --> 11:04.728
thinking that I had killed her,
but she survived.

11:04.728 --> 11:06.064
But then I went
after Denise Hemphill.

11:06.064 --> 11:08.101
Serves her right for
freaking shooting at me.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.609
She's not dead.
Suspended animation.
You're kidding.

11:11.609 --> 11:13.947
Who killed all the Hamiltons?

11:13.947 --> 11:15.316
Oh. Right here.
(dings)

11:15.316 --> 11:16.953
Also, Chanel Pour Homme

11:16.953 --> 11:19.290
and Chanel #11.
(dinging)

11:19.290 --> 11:21.194
Which, by the way, was not easy,
'cause it was, like,

11:21.194 --> 11:22.931
right in the middle
of a work day.

11:22.931 --> 11:24.200
And Chanel #9, too. Yeah.
(dings)

11:24.200 --> 11:26.137
HOFFEL: Wa‐Wa...
Excuse me. I also killed

11:26.137 --> 11:28.977
Chanel #9, and Chanel #10.
(dinging)

11:28.977 --> 11:31.181
A‐And that reporter guy, um...

11:31.181 --> 11:34.020
Slade Hornborn.
(dings)

11:34.020 --> 11:36.191
Dr. Cascade. Looks like
you've had the lion's share

11:36.191 --> 11:38.495
of the murders, which we will
take into consideration

11:38.495 --> 11:41.903
when we move into my next
segment, that I like to call,

11:41.903 --> 11:44.975
"Who Gets to Kill the Chanels?"
(dinging)

11:44.975 --> 11:48.148
Look. I've had
the opportunity to enjoy

11:48.148 --> 11:49.083
some great kills,

11:49.083 --> 11:51.154
so I'm happy to sit out

11:51.154 --> 11:52.925
the rest of the murders
and let you guys finish,

11:52.925 --> 11:54.728
as long as I get to take care

11:54.728 --> 11:57.033
of Number Three.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.003
When you say, "Take care of,"

11:59.003 --> 12:01.776
you don't mean kill.
You actually mean take care of,

12:01.776 --> 12:03.478
because you are
in love with her.

12:03.478 --> 12:05.349
That's right. I am. Okay?

12:05.349 --> 12:07.788
But there's no reason we have
to kill all the Chanels.

12:07.788 --> 12:09.625
Uh, this is a murder summit.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.063
If you're not gonna kill anyone,
you can't take the picture.

12:12.063 --> 12:13.498
Okay. Fine. I'll murder her.

12:13.498 --> 12:16.171
Uh! Are you really
gonna murder her?

12:16.171 --> 12:18.175
Yes! Did you hear me?
I just said yes.
Oh, please.

12:18.175 --> 12:20.547
The only thing you're gonna
kill her with are kisses.
Ugh...

12:20.547 --> 12:22.049
Look, Nurse Hoffel, I know you
haven't gotten the opportunity

12:22.049 --> 12:24.087
to kill very many people,
so I am happy

12:24.087 --> 12:25.389
to let you kill Chanel #5,

12:25.389 --> 12:26.859
and I will take care of Chanel.

12:26.859 --> 12:28.763
Oh, what the hell
are you talking about?

12:28.763 --> 12:31.401
I don't give a rat's bottom
about that cow, Number Five.

12:31.401 --> 12:34.207
Chanel Oberlin fried
my sister's face off.

12:34.207 --> 12:36.912
Chanel Oberlin drove
my daughter insane.

12:36.912 --> 12:39.017
Well, does your insane daughter
still have a face,

12:39.017 --> 12:40.085
or did she get it fried off?

12:40.085 --> 12:41.889
Dad! Nurse Hoffel!

12:41.889 --> 12:43.125
Uh, don't call me that, okay?

12:43.125 --> 12:44.928
It's so embarrassing.

12:44.928 --> 12:46.699
She has a point.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.303
Grace is still alive,
and Ms. Bean died in, like,

12:49.303 --> 12:50.874
the most awful way,

12:50.874 --> 12:53.478
so she has an honest reason
for revenge.

12:53.478 --> 12:56.719
Look, Hoffel. I will give you
Number Five, Number Seven,

12:56.719 --> 12:59.725
Number Eight, and Number Three.
Whoa! Whoa!
Number Three's mine.

12:59.725 --> 13:02.063
Hey, can it, Cascade!
Look, that's Five,

13:02.063 --> 13:04.100
Seven, Eight and Three.
All I want is Chanel.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.237
That's four Chanels
for the price of one.

13:06.237 --> 13:07.908
No. Kiss my ass.

13:07.908 --> 13:10.446
Fine, I will throw in
a Dean Munsch. I love her.

13:10.446 --> 13:12.349
Oh, go suck a hot fart.

13:12.349 --> 13:13.920
L‐Let's take a vote!

13:13.920 --> 13:15.089
A vote? A vote...

13:15.089 --> 13:16.625
What is this? A PTA meeting?

13:16.625 --> 13:18.361
Raise your hand if you think
that Nurse Hoffel

13:18.361 --> 13:20.132
should kill Chanel.

13:21.936 --> 13:24.107
How could you? I am your dad!

13:24.107 --> 13:25.643
Congratulations, Nurse Hoffel.

13:25.643 --> 13:27.914
You get to kill Chanel Oberlin
in any way that you see fit.

13:27.914 --> 13:29.785
God, this summit is a joke.

13:29.785 --> 13:31.922
Oh, Wes. Come on.
You still get to kill

13:31.922 --> 13:34.393
Moebius girl, Marfan, Number
Five, and Dean Munsch.

13:34.393 --> 13:35.797
It's not that bad.

13:35.797 --> 13:37.299
And remember, Dr. Cascade.

13:37.299 --> 13:40.105
It is your responsibility
to kill Number Three.

13:40.105 --> 13:41.642
Yeah, like that's
really gonna happen.

13:41.642 --> 13:44.515
It is.
I'm gonna kill her so hard.

14:22.423 --> 14:24.628
It's a complicated situation.

Not really.
It's a simple ultimatum.

14:26.832 --> 14:28.536
If you want to be my boyfriend,
then you have

14:28.536 --> 14:30.940
to stop killing people,
which, honestly,

14:30.940 --> 14:32.711
makes me the most
super low‐maintenance.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.084
Fine. I'm scared of her.

14:53.084 --> 14:55.222
We can go talk to her together.

14:55.222 --> 14:58.428
Our love will make you brave.

14:58.428 --> 15:00.867
That's a terrible idea.

Look, she's...

15:04.106 --> 15:06.144

Look, I know you're hot

15:39.544 --> 15:42.282
challenging standardized test
there is in the world. Now,

15:42.282 --> 15:44.453
you're gonna need to understand
nuances of complex articles

15:44.453 --> 15:46.090
filled with technical
medical vocabulary,

15:46.090 --> 15:48.629
there's, uh...
math equations

15:48.629 --> 15:51.067
that even M. I. T. students
would get lost in.

15:51.067 --> 15:54.106
People study for years
to pass this test.

17:36.177 --> 17:37.179
Why?

17:37.179 --> 17:39.551
Because...

17:39.551 --> 17:42.624
in all my years as a nurse,
and hospital administrator,

17:42.624 --> 17:45.295
I have never met a woman

17:45.295 --> 17:48.301
who I thought had the stuff

17:48.301 --> 17:51.374
to be a doctor
more than you, Chanel.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.244
Really?

17:53.244 --> 17:56.818
Which is why I'm gonna give you
this secret to passing the MCAT.

17:56.818 --> 17:57.820
(inhales)

17:57.820 --> 17:59.390
The answer to all the questions

17:59.390 --> 18:00.492
is B.

18:00.492 --> 18:01.628
Seriously?

18:01.628 --> 18:04.033
That makes so much sense.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.368
I know, a‐and you know,
I probably didn't even need

18:05.368 --> 18:07.840
to tell you.
You girls are so smart.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.443
And you would do
well on your own.

18:09.443 --> 18:12.215
Now that you have
the inside tip,

18:12.215 --> 18:15.188
I think you ladies
can ace the MCATs.

18:15.188 --> 18:17.225
(squeals)
Thank you!

18:17.225 --> 18:18.962
Oh!

18:18.962 --> 18:20.231
Hey, why are you
filling up the tub

18:20.231 --> 18:21.968
with fry oil?

18:21.968 --> 18:25.341
Because this is a new
experimental therapy

18:25.341 --> 18:28.247
for making your skin soft.
You should try it.

18:28.247 --> 18:29.918
When it's all ready.

18:29.918 --> 18:31.888
No thanks.

18:31.888 --> 18:34.026
I have some bad memories
with fry oil.

18:34.026 --> 18:36.397
(chuckles)
Later.

18:36.397 --> 18:38.401
♪ ♪

18:47.219 --> 18:49.456
BROCK:
Hester.

18:49.456 --> 18:51.227
Can I ask you a question?

18:51.227 --> 18:53.197
(whispers):
In private?

18:53.197 --> 18:54.534
Ask away.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.938
Mrs. Wainwright died
a couple of hours ago.

18:56.938 --> 18:59.778
Why isn't she tagged?
'Cause I haven't
told anyone yet.

18:59.778 --> 19:02.517
I like taking advantage of
having access to a fresh corpse.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.353
Right.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.323
Listen.

19:06.323 --> 19:09.831
You've had some issues in the
past with killing people, right?

19:09.831 --> 19:12.837
One person. Okay?
I killed one person.

19:12.837 --> 19:14.072
But to be fair, I did oversee

19:14.072 --> 19:15.743
the killings
of a few other people.

19:15.743 --> 19:17.379
All right, for the purpose
of our conversation,

19:17.379 --> 19:18.447
that'll do.

19:18.447 --> 19:19.951
Now,

19:19.951 --> 19:21.955
I used to think
that I wanted to kill Chanel

19:21.955 --> 19:24.561
because I had the hand
of a serial killer.

19:26.297 --> 19:29.771
But now that I have
the hand of a normal person,

19:29.771 --> 19:32.910
I still really want to kill her.

19:32.910 --> 19:34.914
More than ever,
to tell you the truth.

19:36.217 --> 19:37.485
I see.

19:37.485 --> 19:39.156
(sighs)

19:39.156 --> 19:43.097
I see three possible conclusions
that we can draw from this.

19:43.097 --> 19:45.569
Number one, the twin
that was subsumed in the body

19:45.569 --> 19:48.241
of Anna Plaisance
was also a serial killer,

19:48.241 --> 19:50.813
so you were yet again given the
hand of another serial killer.

19:50.813 --> 19:52.817
Highly unlikely.
Statistically speaking.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.821
I agree. Number two,

19:54.821 --> 19:56.591
is that Chanel
is a terrible person,

19:56.591 --> 19:59.196
and the more time you spend
with her, the more you realize

19:59.196 --> 20:00.933
she needs to die.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.170
I'm beginning
to get behind that.
Mm.

20:03.170 --> 20:05.108
And what's option number three?

20:05.108 --> 20:07.012
That it was never
really about the hand.

20:10.552 --> 20:12.857
The hand was just an excuse.

20:12.857 --> 20:16.831
That, of course, it's in your
true nature to save lives,

20:16.831 --> 20:19.369
but it's also to end them.

20:21.006 --> 20:23.879
That you, Dr. Brock Holt,

20:23.879 --> 20:25.148
are a killer.

20:25.148 --> 20:28.689
And you need to be
with a woman who...

20:28.689 --> 20:30.693
shares your taste

20:30.693 --> 20:32.997
for murder.

20:32.997 --> 20:35.068
Someone who celebrates

20:35.068 --> 20:38.240
the hot, hard,

20:38.240 --> 20:41.681
dangerous parts of you
that are so desperate

20:41.681 --> 20:44.286
to get out.

20:56.644 --> 20:57.980
(gasps)

20:57.980 --> 21:00.719
Snickerdoodles? My favorite!

21:15.716 --> 21:16.918
(gagging)

21:16.918 --> 21:19.724
(restrained screaming)

21:23.230 --> 21:24.466
(gasping)

21:26.470 --> 21:27.873
(leash stretching)

21:29.744 --> 21:32.248
(distant screaming)

21:33.284 --> 21:34.921
(Chanel #5 screaming)

21:34.921 --> 21:36.290
She's dead!

21:36.290 --> 21:37.827
Chanel Number...

21:37.827 --> 21:39.664
uh, she's dead.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.302
We need to
call the police!

21:42.302 --> 21:43.137
No, no, no.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.306
This young woman suffers

21:44.306 --> 21:46.110
from Marfan syndrome.

21:46.110 --> 21:48.180
Um, complications from that

21:48.180 --> 21:49.917
can include the heart and aorta.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.957
There's an increased risk
of mitral valve prolapse

21:52.957 --> 21:54.660
and aortic aneurysm.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.929
Very likely she just died

21:55.929 --> 21:56.931
of a heart attack.
(chuckles)

21:56.931 --> 21:57.867
How do you know that?

21:57.867 --> 21:59.269
I've worked in a hospital

21:59.269 --> 22:00.672
for months now.

22:00.672 --> 22:02.375
I pay attention.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.947
How do you explain
the marks on her neck?

22:07.887 --> 22:09.757
Oh, my God.

22:09.757 --> 22:11.393
Oh.

22:11.393 --> 22:12.395
Oh, I'm fine.

22:12.395 --> 22:13.397
I'm fine, I'm fine.

22:13.397 --> 22:14.600
You don't seem fine.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.936
No, no, I'm fine.

22:15.936 --> 22:18.474
You should have a doctor
examine you.

22:18.474 --> 22:20.478
Yes. Um,

22:20.478 --> 22:22.348
in fact, maybe Arthur,
you could

22:22.348 --> 22:23.919
help me back to my office.

22:23.919 --> 22:25.154
Yes, of course.
Such a gentleman

22:25.154 --> 22:26.524
and so strong.

22:26.524 --> 22:29.262
Um, Chanel #5,

22:29.262 --> 22:30.498
make sure that you
alert the authorities

22:30.498 --> 22:32.101
about Chanel #7.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.939
And you and the rest
of the Chanels

22:33.939 --> 22:36.210
should take her to
my special morgue.

22:36.210 --> 22:38.180
Special morgue.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.449
Got it.

22:44.326 --> 22:46.798
(panting)

22:49.135 --> 22:50.973
Funny running
into you here.

22:50.973 --> 22:52.977
You've been following me
since I left the hospital.

22:52.977 --> 22:54.346
I'm was trying
to stay in shape.

22:54.346 --> 22:56.149
Killing people demands
serious cardio.

22:56.149 --> 22:58.053
And strength.

22:58.053 --> 22:59.557
Man, that damn Marfan girl,

22:59.557 --> 23:02.161
she almost gave me a hernia.

23:02.161 --> 23:04.266
(panting)

23:04.266 --> 23:06.804
What do you want?

23:08.642 --> 23:10.679
Nurse Hoffel doesn't care
about us.

23:10.679 --> 23:12.448
About the community
of Green Meanies.

23:12.448 --> 23:13.685
She's a lone wolf.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.856
So?
So what happens

23:15.856 --> 23:17.860
when this is all done
and the hospital closes down?

23:17.860 --> 23:19.162
I'll tell you what.

23:19.162 --> 23:21.701
The biggest unsolved murder case
of all time.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.070
It'll make Zodiac
and Jack the Ripper

23:23.070 --> 23:24.406
look like a game of <i>Clue.</i>

23:24.406 --> 23:26.143
I hadn't thought about that.

23:26.143 --> 23:27.378
Because you're not that smart.

23:27.378 --> 23:29.482
But Nurse Hoffel is.

23:29.482 --> 23:31.654
I can guarantee you
that she has a plan

23:31.654 --> 23:33.424
for framing one of us.
And considering

23:33.424 --> 23:34.894
that it's just a matter of time

23:34.894 --> 23:36.263
before someone figures out
who your mom is,

23:36.263 --> 23:39.235
I will bet my sweet ass that

23:39.235 --> 23:41.239
she's painting that
bull's‐eye on you, big guy.

23:41.239 --> 23:43.243
So, what are you suggesting?

23:44.079 --> 23:45.849
An alliance.

23:45.849 --> 23:47.586
I'm gonna take out Chanel
before Hoffel can,

23:47.586 --> 23:49.456
but I need you to back me up
when I do.

23:49.456 --> 23:51.594
She can't take
the both of us on.

23:51.594 --> 23:53.397
And once this is all done,

23:53.397 --> 23:54.867
we pin the whole thing on her

23:54.867 --> 23:57.806
and everybody walks away happy.

23:57.806 --> 23:59.877
Deal?

24:02.148 --> 24:04.185
Deal.

24:11.901 --> 24:15.107
(moaning, gasping)

24:15.107 --> 24:16.677
Help!

24:16.677 --> 24:17.880
Help me!

24:17.880 --> 24:21.052
(door opening)

24:25.261 --> 24:27.566
No point screaming, dear.

24:27.566 --> 24:28.968
(exhales)

24:28.968 --> 24:30.104
I'll just tell anyone that comes

24:30.104 --> 24:31.874
that I was watching television

24:31.874 --> 24:33.878
very loudly.

24:33.878 --> 24:36.483
My friends are gonna
come looking for me.

24:36.483 --> 24:38.253
From what I hear from my son,

24:38.253 --> 24:41.092
they haven't even realized
that you're missing yet.

24:41.092 --> 24:42.161
CASSIDY:
Mom?

24:44.165 --> 24:45.401
Mom, are you home?

24:45.401 --> 24:47.305
Cassidy Cascade?

24:47.305 --> 24:50.110
(door closing)
He's the baby in the belly.

24:51.112 --> 24:53.918
Mazel tov, Nancy Drew.

24:53.918 --> 24:55.154
Cassidy!

24:55.154 --> 24:56.691
Cassidy...

24:56.691 --> 24:59.162
(faintly):
Cassidy Cascade!

25:06.309 --> 25:08.213
Hello, my love.

25:08.213 --> 25:10.719
I was just checking in on...

25:11.754 --> 25:13.223
And who's this?

25:13.223 --> 25:14.425
I'm Chanel #3,

25:14.425 --> 25:15.762
Cassidy's girlfriend.

25:15.762 --> 25:16.998
Hasn't he mentioned me?

25:18.066 --> 25:20.304
The name sounds familiar.

25:20.304 --> 25:22.275
Okay, knock it off, Mom.
(kisses)

25:23.778 --> 25:26.016
If you're coming here
to try to convince me

25:26.016 --> 25:27.786
to stop Cassidy

25:27.786 --> 25:29.022
from murdering people
in service of

25:29.022 --> 25:30.190
shutting the hospital down,

25:30.190 --> 25:31.827
you're wasting your time.

25:31.827 --> 25:34.032
Slow down, Mom.
Don't you want to

25:34.032 --> 25:36.036
get to know Chanel #3
a little?

25:36.036 --> 25:37.839
(scoffs) I know everything
I need to know,

25:37.839 --> 25:39.510
from her social media footprint.

25:39.510 --> 25:41.781
She's heiress
to the Swenson

25:41.781 --> 25:44.185
frozen food fortune,
but was disowned

25:44.185 --> 25:46.189
when she was put
into an insane asylum.

25:46.189 --> 25:47.325
For a crime I didn't commit.

25:47.325 --> 25:48.327
JANE:
Says you.

25:48.327 --> 25:50.164
She describes herself
on Facebook

25:50.164 --> 25:51.867
as "pansexual,"

25:51.867 --> 25:53.170
which as far as I can tell,

25:53.170 --> 25:55.040
is just "bisexual"
for Millennials

25:55.040 --> 25:56.476
who want even more attention.

25:56.476 --> 25:58.815
And don't even get me started
on the earmuffs.

25:58.815 --> 26:00.184
Mom, stop.
I'm not finished.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.188
Finally, she thinks that

26:02.188 --> 26:04.425
just because she's
waxing my son's knob,

26:04.425 --> 26:05.929
she can come into my house

26:05.929 --> 26:08.000
and tell me how to raise my boy.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.603
I have heard enough.

26:09.603 --> 26:11.439
I'm sorry your husband died
and it made you sad.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.043
But can't you see
the major logic fail

26:13.043 --> 26:15.014
in closing down a hospital
that is actually curing people?

26:15.014 --> 26:16.684
Isn't that what you
were so upset about

26:16.684 --> 26:18.186
in the first place?

26:18.186 --> 26:19.355
No one who worked at
the hospital back then

26:19.355 --> 26:20.992
still works there.

26:20.992 --> 26:22.863
You're mad at architecture

26:22.863 --> 26:24.833
and geography.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.204
It would be like murdering all
the guests at a Hilton hotel

26:27.204 --> 26:30.044
just because you got bummed out
listening to Paris' awful song.

26:30.044 --> 26:31.479
You don't know what it's like

26:31.479 --> 26:33.417
to lose someone that you love.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.054
Yes, I do.

26:35.054 --> 26:37.224
And I don't want it
to happen again.

26:37.224 --> 26:39.028
What would happen
if Cassidy got caught?

26:39.028 --> 26:40.197
I'd take the fall.

26:40.197 --> 26:42.234
Really hot girls

26:42.234 --> 26:43.604
and sweet old ladies

26:43.604 --> 26:46.242
can pretty much get away
with anything.

26:46.242 --> 26:47.946
I should know.

26:47.946 --> 26:49.215
I've been both.

26:49.215 --> 26:51.419
Why don't we ask Cassidy
what he wants.

26:51.419 --> 26:53.256
Yes.

26:53.256 --> 26:55.127
Let's.

26:55.127 --> 26:57.231
Sweetheart,

26:57.231 --> 26:59.603
would you rather
betray the memory

26:59.603 --> 27:01.540
of your saint of a father

27:01.540 --> 27:02.909
and break your mother's heart,

27:02.909 --> 27:06.416
and run off with
Earmuffs here, or

27:06.416 --> 27:09.055
finish the job you were raised
from a pup to complete?

27:09.055 --> 27:11.092
I know what it's like
to have parents that are

27:11.092 --> 27:12.696
more interested in themselves
than what's best for you.

38:04.565 --> 38:06.368
we would like
to hire the Chanels

38:06.368 --> 38:08.840
as her permanent replacement
on <i>Lovin' the D.</i>

38:08.840 --> 38:10.644
Wait, what? I'm the one
who did the surgery.

38:10.644 --> 38:11.712
Yeah, and you were great.

38:11.712 --> 38:12.714
Let me get this straight.

38:12.714 --> 38:14.017
Your boss just got poisoned,

38:14.017 --> 38:15.554
and you want to
replace her right away?

38:15.554 --> 38:17.190
I think we should be
calling the cops.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.660
No. Look.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.362
Dr. Lovin was a nightmare.

38:20.362 --> 38:23.035
We all hated her and we're not
that surprised she got poisoned.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.037
It's probably
one of the P. A.'s

38:24.037 --> 38:25.439
she fired for farting.

38:25.439 --> 38:26.943
You know she had a rule
that you got fired

38:26.943 --> 38:28.078
if you farted around her?

38:28.078 --> 38:29.548
Hold on!

38:29.548 --> 38:31.084
I'm not sure
if I heard you correctly.

38:31.084 --> 38:32.386
Did you just...

38:32.386 --> 38:34.792
offer us our own show?

38:34.792 --> 38:36.228
We sure did.

38:37.063 --> 38:39.935
(cries)

38:39.935 --> 38:41.539
(screams)

38:42.574 --> 38:44.745
(crying)

39:00.810 --> 39:01.913
WES:
Can you believe this?

39:01.913 --> 39:03.081
Now they're TV stars.

39:03.081 --> 39:04.718
I mean, for the love of Pete,

39:04.718 --> 39:06.188
those girls could fall
into the Grand Canyon

39:06.188 --> 39:07.023
and land on the moon.

39:07.023 --> 39:08.626
Hmm?

39:09.728 --> 39:11.966
Because they fail upward.

39:11.966 --> 39:13.636
Have you never heard
that term before?

39:13.636 --> 39:15.206
No, never.
Okay.

39:15.206 --> 39:16.776
What do you want to talk
to me about?

39:16.776 --> 39:19.247
This.

39:23.590 --> 39:25.994
You tried to poison Chanel,

39:25.994 --> 39:27.965
thus breaking the
binding resolution

39:27.965 --> 39:30.236
we all agreed to at
the Green Meanie Summit.

39:30.236 --> 39:31.404
Chanel was mine.

39:31.404 --> 39:32.440
Binding resolution?

39:32.440 --> 39:33.843
This isn't the U. N.

39:33.843 --> 39:35.747
We are independent actors,

39:35.747 --> 39:37.951
pretending to work
for the common interest,

39:37.951 --> 39:39.989
but really, really,
we're all just worried

39:39.989 --> 39:42.794
about getting what is best
for us, what we want.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.330
Okay.

39:44.330 --> 39:47.638
Okay, m‐m‐maybe
that's exactly like the U. N.,

39:47.638 --> 39:49.642
but I am really pissed off
at Chanel.

39:49.642 --> 39:53.382
Hey... you were right
about one thing, Wes.

39:53.382 --> 39:55.854
The heat is getting a little
too intense right now.

39:55.854 --> 39:57.223
Yeah, the heat is on.

39:57.223 --> 39:59.127
It's getting harder
and harder to kill

39:59.127 --> 40:01.197
'cause everyone's so on edge.

40:01.197 --> 40:02.300
That's why we decided

40:02.300 --> 40:04.070
we had to let
everyone know that

40:04.070 --> 40:06.007
the Green Meanie
was dead.

40:06.007 --> 40:08.378
A false security to set up

40:08.378 --> 40:12.053
one final orgy
of blood and murder.

40:12.053 --> 40:14.525
Okay, yeah, no, I‐I vote
we frame and kill Hester.

40:14.525 --> 40:15.660
Your own daughter?

40:15.660 --> 40:16.762
Look, look, look, look, look,

40:16.762 --> 40:17.764
I‐I‐I‐I'm sorry.

40:17.764 --> 40:18.766
You know, I mean, clearly...

40:20.169 --> 40:23.075
...I am not built to be
a psycho killer,

40:23.075 --> 40:25.714
so, uh... I'm out.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.085
Look, all I want is
the Chanels to die

40:28.085 --> 40:30.623
and it to be, like,
super painful for them.

40:30.623 --> 40:32.126
I'm good.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.637
Crap.

40:40.409 --> 40:42.246
You guys are gonna kill me,
aren't you?

40:42.246 --> 40:44.752
(chuckles)

40:44.752 --> 40:46.121
Any last words?

40:52.233 --> 40:54.237
Playlist.

40:57.611 --> 41:01.117
(Wes screaming)

41:06.094 --> 41:08.098
(elevator dings)

41:08.098 --> 41:10.068
I must admit

41:10.068 --> 41:12.440
that was amazing work
with that surgery.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.279
You have a very special
team, Dean Munsch.

41:15.279 --> 41:17.717
And you run a tight ship
in terms of regulations.

41:17.717 --> 41:20.122
The devil is in the details.

41:20.122 --> 41:23.261
We need to make sure you
put a stop to the murders.

41:23.261 --> 41:27.102
But there is no rule in the
AMA hospital regulation guide

41:27.102 --> 41:29.975
that relates to serial killers
so I can't ding you for that.

41:29.975 --> 41:31.912
Ah.
I think it's clear

41:31.912 --> 41:35.419
that Hornborn had a breakdown
before his disappearance.

41:35.419 --> 41:38.693
I just need to
check the pH balance

41:38.693 --> 41:41.197
in your hydrotherapy tubs
and then I'll be on my way.

41:41.197 --> 41:42.534
Oh. They're right here.

41:43.936 --> 41:46.775
... tight ship, and
that's how we do it.

41:46.775 --> 41:48.946
(both screaming)

42:00.202 --> 42:02.741
(medical monitors
beeping quietly)

42:11.859 --> 42:12.961
Where's Arthur?

42:12.961 --> 42:14.263
Oh, he left, but don't worry,

42:14.263 --> 42:15.867
he's not gonna shut us down.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.837
Especially now that
the Green Meanie's dead.

42:17.837 --> 42:20.142
CHANEL #5:
So weird that it was Grace's
sexy dad all along.

42:20.142 --> 42:21.645
Uh, not weird at all.

42:21.645 --> 42:23.281
I mean, he used to sit outside
of our house

42:23.281 --> 42:24.851
in his Jeep all night
and stalk us.

42:24.851 --> 42:26.822
He was Creepy McCreeperson.

42:26.822 --> 42:29.528
It looks like he came here
to get revenge on the Chanels

42:29.528 --> 42:30.997
for what they did
to his daughter,

42:30.997 --> 42:33.301
but he slipped
and fell in the tub

42:33.301 --> 42:34.571
while getting it ready

42:34.571 --> 42:36.642
presumably to burn
the Chanels alive.

42:36.642 --> 42:37.978
Well, now that the
Green Meanie's dead

42:37.978 --> 42:39.180
we can all finally relax

42:39.180 --> 42:40.583
and enjoy being med
students for real.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.852
Yeah, sure.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.823
Totally.
Speaking of which,

42:43.823 --> 42:44.992
I'm pretty positive
that Zayday's,

42:44.992 --> 42:46.227
like, officially missing.

42:46.227 --> 42:47.831
Her Snapchat feed has
gone totally dark,

42:47.831 --> 42:49.233
and I have zero idea
what the gag has been

42:49.233 --> 42:50.570
for, like, a week now.
(sighs)

42:50.570 --> 42:53.341
Why is this the first
I'm hearing of this?

42:53.341 --> 42:55.078
W‐W‐We have to go
find her immediately.

42:55.078 --> 42:56.114
BROCK:
No, no, no, no, no.

42:56.114 --> 42:58.084
I guess.

42:58.084 --> 42:59.921
I mean, sure.

42:59.921 --> 43:01.525
One small thing first,
Dean Munsch.

43:01.525 --> 43:04.163
Arthur says this wasn't the
first time that you fainted.

43:04.163 --> 43:06.234
Yeah. I'm gonna run
some more tests on you.

43:06.234 --> 43:08.506
What I have doesn't
show up on tests.

43:11.010 --> 43:13.415
I have a disease called Kuru.

43:13.415 --> 43:15.586
It is terminal and incurable.

43:18.926 --> 43:20.930
I'll be dead in a month.
