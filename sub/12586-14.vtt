WEBVTT

00:33.491 --> 00:35.410
-

00:35.493 --> 00:37.829
There he is. Go on, ask him.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.373
Oh, no. What's this?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.168
Mr. Hill?

00:43.251 --> 00:46.504
Uh, oh, uh, hey there, Inez.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.423
Will you speak at my quinceanera?

00:48.506 --> 00:51.009
Uh, well, what's a quinceanera?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.343
It's a celebration, Hank!

00:52.427 --> 00:55.555
Inez is turning 15,
and in Mexican culture,

00:55.638 --> 00:57.849
that's when she's recognized
to be a woman.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.893
I'm so happy, Hank!

00:59.976 --> 01:03.104
Uh, well, I'd love to speak at her,

01:03.188 --> 01:05.315
-uh, party, but, uh,

01:05.398 --> 01:07.525
I don't really know your daughter
all that well.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.818
The party's a month away,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.862
so you have plenty of time
to get to know her.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.281
Why don't you come over
to my house tomorrow?

01:13.364 --> 01:16.868
Uh, well, the thing about that is...

01:19.704 --> 01:22.540
I'm kind of on the spot here.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.376
Great! So I'll see you tomorrow
at my place!

01:29.589 --> 01:30.965
Man of honor?

01:32.050 --> 01:33.802
That's quite an honor.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.347
I would not be involved
in a quinceanera, Hank.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.432
Do you know what goes on at those things?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.391
I do.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.936
They sacrifice the oldest woman
in the room

01:43.019 --> 01:45.230
to make room for the new, younger woman.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.774
Well, I can't back out of it now.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.026
I already told Enrique I'd speak.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.070
At least he thinks I did.

01:52.153 --> 01:57.408
What can I say about a 14-year-old girl
that I only see a couple times a year?

01:57.492 --> 02:00.954
All I know is she ate fruit salad
at the company picnic.

02:01.704 --> 02:02.789
What did you eat?

02:04.415 --> 02:06.793
This could be your own
private hideaway.

02:07.919 --> 02:10.672
Ugh! What's with those guys in the alley?

02:10.755 --> 02:13.174
Oh, those guys? They're never there.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
So what do you think of this house?

02:16.594 --> 02:18.263
Pretty freaking cool, huh?

02:18.346 --> 02:20.682
Uh, no. I hate it here.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.851
I mean, why don't you understand
what I'm looking for?

02:22.934 --> 02:24.477
I want something real.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.604
This is real, man.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.023
Honey, this is real estate.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.817
You don't get it.

02:30.900 --> 02:37.115
Asa, I have shown you over 30 houses now,
and I still have no idea what you want.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.576
I want a house.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.411
This is a house.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.663
This neighborhood is nowhere.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.707
I feel like I'm nowhere.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.794
Okay, let's keep looking then.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.216
Sorry about the instant potatoes.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.178
That whiny client
is taking up all of my time.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.513
You're still working
with that giblet-head?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.974
Why don't you just pass him off
to another realtor?

03:03.057 --> 03:06.978
Because I have invested
too much time with him to do that.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.190
It's like when you've lost
so much money at blackjack

03:10.273 --> 03:13.318
that the only smart thing
to do is keep playing.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.904
Well, I'd trade places
with you if I could.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.741
I really don't think I'm the right person
to speak at Inez's party.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.284
I don't speak Spanish,

03:21.367 --> 03:25.455
and most of the people who will be there
will probably want to hear some Spanish.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.584
Well, I do know a lot
about Mexican girls and quinceaneras.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.087
Why don't I come over
to Enrique's tomorrow and help you?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.507
Right after I show Asa
five more houses he won't like.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.053
You know, everybody
gets a big party except for me.

03:40.136 --> 03:45.600
Mexicans have 15, Jews have 13,
rich girls have sweet 16.

03:45.683 --> 03:49.646
Everyone has some crazy day
except for Christian boy.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.232
Your baptism was amazing.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.733
So I've heard.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.028
I don't think anyone has dibs on 14,

03:57.111 --> 03:58.696
so that could be mine.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.241
It could be called a Sweet Fourteen-o.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.159
There could be dancing and music,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.663
and then I'd have
to eat 14 hot dogs before sunset,

04:06.746 --> 04:09.499
or I shall remain a boy forever!

04:13.336 --> 04:14.837
Where is Peggy?

04:19.008 --> 04:20.468
Hey, Hank!

04:20.551 --> 04:22.929
Come in, come in. Inez is waiting!

04:23.596 --> 04:25.348
Oh!

04:28.768 --> 04:30.270
This is where I watch TV,

04:30.353 --> 04:32.563
and in there, that's my bedroom.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.023
-That's where I sleep.
-Hm.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.149
And that's a bathroom.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.484
We don't need to talk about

04:36.567 --> 04:38.778
what goes on in there, huh, Hank?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.368
Yeah, that looks like
a pretty sturdy stage.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.746
That's for the quinceanera
for the band and for you.

04:48.830 --> 04:52.166
I'm also going to make a trellis
for Inez to walk through,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.376
like a symbol.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.922
On that side, she's a girl,
then on that side, she's a woman.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.050
I might try sending my wife Yolanda
through it backwards!

05:02.343 --> 05:04.178
Uh, this is gonna be some party.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.722
I always do it up.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.307
And you haven't heard the best part.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.350
Right after Inez becomes a woman,

05:09.434 --> 05:10.727
she's going to spin around

05:10.810 --> 05:14.856
as a thousand rose petals
rain down on her from above.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.274
-Wow.
-Yeah.

05:16.357 --> 05:18.651
It's great. I spare no expense.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.861
Come on, Yolanda.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.280
Hank and Inez have a lot to talk about.

05:35.710 --> 05:40.048
Uh, so, uh,
tell me a little bit about yourself.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.053
That's a pretty bird.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.596
Birds, huh?

05:46.679 --> 05:49.057
Okay. Birds.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.978
Come on, Peggy.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.106
No!

05:57.190 --> 05:59.525
Come on, you haven't even seen
the house yet.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.152
Take me somewhere else.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.783
What are we doing here?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.327
I just have to run in
and help my husband learn

06:09.410 --> 06:10.912
about a 14-year-old Mexican girl.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.538
I'll crack the window for you.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.420
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.005
You must be Inez.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.924
Such a beautiful woman.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.344
I cannot believe
you haven't been quinceanerad yet.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.390
I'm glad you're here.
It's not going so well.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.432
Don't worry.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.142
People naturally open up to me.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.062


06:37.563 --> 06:39.023
Okay, I broke the ice.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.483
Now you take it from here.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.822
Uh, I should actually get going, too.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.618
I hope you got everything
you need for your speech,

06:50.701 --> 06:52.286
because Buck Strickland's coming.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.164
You have to do a good job
so he understands

06:55.248 --> 06:57.667
why I chose you
to give the speech over him!

06:57.750 --> 07:00.628
Buck really wanted
to give the speech, Hank.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.507
Oh, no.

07:05.758 --> 07:06.592
He ran.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.929
I'll take it!

07:10.596 --> 07:11.597
Really?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.641
Oh, yeah, I love it here.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.101
This is real.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.228
This is what I was talking about!

07:17.311 --> 07:18.938
No whiteys.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.569
Oh, he, he doesn't live here.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.945
Enrique does.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.281
Enrique, meet your new neighbor!

07:28.364 --> 07:30.074
<i>Viva La Raza!</i>

07:30.825 --> 07:32.243
Uh... okay.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.421
Okay, see you at 10:00. Sweet.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.923
Hank, that is the fifth cool person
I've talked to

07:46.007 --> 07:47.967
that wants to move
into Enrique's neighborhood.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.803
Asa's friends are a honey pot,

07:50.887 --> 07:53.764
and I'm the only realtor bear
with my paw in them.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.477
Why does that Asa guy want to live
in Enrique's neighborhood anyway?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.812
Why do you ask, because he's white?

07:59.896 --> 08:01.481
No, because he's weird.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.066
Well, that weird guy's loan
was pre-approved.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.068
Probably because he has rich parents.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.945
And all of his friends are young,

08:08.029 --> 08:10.698
starving artists
who also have rich parents.

08:10.781 --> 08:11.741
Artists?

08:11.824 --> 08:14.368
But that neighborhood
seems pretty family-oriented.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.996
Hank, cool, young people
are good for neighborhoods.

08:17.079 --> 08:18.789
They come in and bring new life...

08:18.873 --> 08:21.459
art, music, a funky night life.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.919
Yeah, if you say so.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.670
I just need help with this speech.

08:24.754 --> 08:28.174
I didn't get much out of Inez
except that she likes birds.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.717
You got to help me, Peggy.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.053
I'm sorry, but I do not have time today.

08:32.136 --> 08:36.140
I have to find a three-bedroom loft space
for someone named DJ Peanut Butter.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.433
Maybe Bobby can help you.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.268
He knows some 14-year-old girls.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.771
Well, there is one in my class.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.815
But she was held back
because she's a dumb-dumb.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.984
Bobby, now, just help your father.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.110
Fine,

08:48.194 --> 08:51.239
but we should really be working
on my Sweet Fourteen-o.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.491
That's gonna sneak up on us.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.159
Okay.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.994
The thing about girls is,

08:57.078 --> 08:59.872
they're all obsessed
with the popular girls.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.875
Love 'em or hate 'em,
they want to talk about 'em.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.002
Bring up the popular girls,

09:05.086 --> 09:08.965
and I promise your problem
will be getting her to shut up.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.596
Uh, tell me about the popular girls.

09:16.597 --> 09:18.808
Well, there's this girl Gabriella.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.977
She wears eyeliner
and bracelets up to here.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.019
And then there's Amelia.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.479
She wears boots,
and she says she has a car,

09:23.563 --> 09:24.730
but I don't think she has a car.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.983
And then there's Anna,
and she's got glitter in her eyeball,

09:27.066 --> 09:28.734
and I think her hair
might be fake, but I don't know,

09:28.818 --> 09:29.986
but she put a towel on her head one day...

09:30.069 --> 09:30.903
What did I tell you?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.738
I knew she'd open up to you.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.532
Do your <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, Inez.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.242
You stole my man.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.618
I know your secret.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.204
I'll tell everyone.
You burnt down my house.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.708
It's like we live on Wisterias Lane, Hank!

09:44.375 --> 09:46.502
Okay, maybe I could ask a question,

09:46.586 --> 09:49.046
and then Inez
will just answer that question.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.214
Does that sound good?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.632
Sure!

09:52.883 --> 09:55.803
First question, do you have any hobbies?

09:55.886 --> 09:59.223
I like soccer,
and I like to go to the movies.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.558
Really, soccer?

10:00.641 --> 10:02.560
So you like sports, kinda?

10:38.137 --> 10:40.598
Well, you got some girl there, Enrique.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
Everyone in the neighborhood
just loves her.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.101
Yeah, she's like me, Hank.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.022
This is the best fish taco yet.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.441
And I could drink horchata forever.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.694
<i>Hola, mi familia!</i>

10:53.778 --> 10:55.863
<i>Cervezas, amigo!</i>

10:55.946 --> 10:57.114
Yeah, man.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.200
These guys.

10:59.283 --> 11:02.036
Check it out.
My boy, Chester, just produced this.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.454
Let me know what you guys think.

11:14.715 --> 11:18.219
This music makes me feel weird
and depressed.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.845
I'm changing it back.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.350
Whoa.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.436
I think this ese might be
in the wrong barrio.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.230
You know where you are, gringo?

11:29.313 --> 11:30.231
What?

11:30.314 --> 11:34.026
Hey, Hank, you want another taco?
Because I just ate your last one.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.486
Oh, right.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.529
He's with you.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.447
Yeah, Hank's my friend.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.450
Any friend of mi hermano
is a friend of mine.

11:42.618 --> 11:46.038
I don't even know these guys, Hank,
but they always know me.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.373
It's real weird.

11:49.959 --> 11:54.130
I think this place is just perfect
for your gallery.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.466
I'm looking for someplace to, uh,

11:57.550 --> 11:59.760
something a little more...

12:00.886 --> 12:02.012
I dunno.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.849
Like a loft?

12:06.350 --> 12:09.979
Every house in this neighborhood
can be converted into a loft.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.856
I'm in.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.441
Do you have a light?

12:13.524 --> 12:14.400
Always.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.532
Boy, Enrique's neighborhood
sure has changed, I tell you what.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.452
All these "artists" moved in so fast.

12:24.535 --> 12:28.122
And they all look the same,
real skinny and walk slowly.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.916
The people you are referring to
are hipsters.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.712
They walk slowly
because they got no place to be, man.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.922
Yeah, well, Inez and I don't like 'em.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.759
It's hard enough to be a girl
on the verge of womanhood

12:39.842 --> 12:41.886
without everything changing around you.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.971
And things are changing fast now.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.055
Oh, Hank.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.390
That's beautiful.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.933
Don't tell us that.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.060
Save it for the quinceanera.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.270
You know, Bill, you're right.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.397
That could be a good angle for my speech.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.232
I gotta write this down.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.360
Hank! It's salmon!

12:58.444 --> 13:00.863
They put salmon in the fish tacos, Hank!

13:00.946 --> 13:02.114
What are you talking about?

13:02.823 --> 13:04.116
Look at it!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.619
It's salmon! They're ruining everything!

13:06.702 --> 13:09.121
Oh, no, not the fish tacos.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.915
Maybe you could talk to Peggy.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.502
Maybe she could sell
those funny people houses somewhere else.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.920
Well, I did, and Peggy says

13:16.003 --> 13:18.464
that those people
are actually good for your neighborhood.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.799
Bring in some new life.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.468
And salmon is very high in omega-3's.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.386
I don't want a new life, Hank.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.056
I liked my life
and my tacos the way they were.

13:27.139 --> 13:31.143
Okay, Enrique, just calm down.
You need to be focusing on Inez's party.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.186
I'll talk to Peggy.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.479
Thanks, Hank.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.147
And show her this.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.695
Peggy, we gotta get going
to that quinceanera.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.113
You should get ready.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.573
What are you doing?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.867
Texting is the new talking, Hank.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.913
That thing looks kind of expensive, Peggy.

13:50.996 --> 13:51.831
Well, it is.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.624
But I've been making
a lot of money lately.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.461
I am flipping Little Mexico
like a giant, golden quesadilla!

13:57.545 --> 13:59.213
Uh, yeah, about that.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.714
Enrique wanted me to talk to you

14:00.798 --> 14:02.883
about the people you're bringing
to his neighborhood.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.094
Hank, neighborhoods change with time.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.054
Hispanics didn't always live there.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.931
Who knows who lived there before them?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.475
Native Americans
probably owned those houses.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
But they're hipsters, Peggy.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.355
I promise you, Hank,
Enrique will thank me.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.233
His neighborhood
has become the hot spot of Arlen.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.943
And if he really doesn't like it,

14:21.026 --> 14:23.821
he can just sell his house
for a huge profit.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.239
Well, I guess you're right.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.449
Ooh, someone just texted me back.

14:27.533 --> 14:30.786
QRS smiley face.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.288
What do you think that means?

14:41.922 --> 14:44.508
I can't believe how far we had to park.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.386
All these electric cars
can't be for Enrique's.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.264
No. DJ Donkey-Oats
is also having a party tonight.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.683
Is everyone a DJ?

14:52.766 --> 14:53.726
Yes.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.280
Hey, Hills, thanks for coming.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.948
This is a happy day.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.825
Let's all be happy, okay?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.037
So Hank, you got your speech ready?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.623
I think I'll do Inez proud.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.212
Inez, you look beautiful.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.506
So are you ready
to walk through that trellis?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.009
I can't believe this is happening.
It's like a dream.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.844
Oh, and guess who came?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.220
Anna and Gabriella!

15:30.304 --> 15:31.889
Really? They're talking again?

15:31.972 --> 15:33.057
That's great!

15:33.140 --> 15:36.685
But what about Carlos?
This could get really uncomfortable.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.605
Hank. I'll be videotaping your speech.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.149
And the sacrifice.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
Everyone, welcome!

15:47.363 --> 15:49.949
Thank you all for coming
to this special day.

15:50.032 --> 15:53.994
When Inez was born,
it was the happiest day of my life.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.120
Aww.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.080
Yes.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.332
I'm so happy I can do this for Inez.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.834
And a great man made this possible.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.087
My boss, Hank Hill.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.838
Oh, and I could have done it.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.384
Hank spent the last few weeks
getting to know my family better,

16:08.467 --> 16:11.178
and he brought his wife Peggy with him.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.681
Peggy started selling houses around here.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.350
She really changed things, huh?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.478
And now our rent has gone up,

16:19.561 --> 16:23.357
and we can't afford
to stay here anymore so we have to move.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.276
I don't know where I'm going to go.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.862
I don't know where Inez will be a woman!

16:28.946 --> 16:30.406
I don't want to move!

16:30.489 --> 16:31.865
I'm scared, Hank!

16:39.707 --> 16:41.417
Yeah, Hank, get up there!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.751
Do it to it, buddy!

16:42.835 --> 16:44.169
Woo!

16:52.970 --> 16:55.514
Well, that was a disaster.

16:55.597 --> 16:59.268
I can't believe that
Enrique doesn't own his own house.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.562
He's lived there for over 20 years.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.064
Who rents a house for 20 years?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.859
I'm pretty sure
Inez's room is an addition.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.819
But the neighborhood is getting nicer.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.613
If anything,
the skyrocketing rents attest to that.

17:13.198 --> 17:16.201
Oh, Hank, I've been a bad Realtor.

17:16.285 --> 17:20.039
I abused my power, I sold irresponsibly.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.124
Well, it's not all your fault.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.335
Uh, yeah, yeah, it is.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.088
Hipsters were attracted
to me because I am cool.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.465
And I played it up.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.883
Peg, the cool Realtor,

17:30.966 --> 17:33.552
slapping fives
and throwing up peace signs.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.346
I'm disgusting.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.309
<i>Please, God,</i>

17:40.392 --> 17:42.186
give me one more crown!

17:42.895 --> 17:43.979
Pineapple?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.814
Oh, pineapple!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.068
I just wanted you to know

17:49.151 --> 17:51.153
that Peggy feels terrible
about what's happened.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.154
We both do.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.447
I'm freaking out here.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.742
Yolanda doesn't want to move,
and I don't know what to do.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.035
Well, I don't get it.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.788
You make good money here.
Why don't you own your house?

18:00.871 --> 18:04.041
Aww, you sound like my cousin.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.668
"You gotta buy, interest rates are good."

18:06.752 --> 18:08.295
I live for today, okay?

18:08.378 --> 18:09.922
I like to have a good time.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.174
You mean you spend
all your money on parties?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.175
And funerals.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.552
What am I gonna do?

18:15.636 --> 18:17.179
None of us want to move.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.515
Inez doesn't want to go to a new school.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.350
She can't go to a new school.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.686
She just started eating lunch
with Anna and Gabriella.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.358
Okay. How about this?

18:29.441 --> 18:30.984
Now, I'm just thinking out loud here.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.487
There was a practice
in realty called red lining

18:33.570 --> 18:36.323
that kept blacks from owning
in certain neighborhoods.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.992
Now, that was obviously bad.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.578
But if we used it against hipsters,

18:41.662 --> 18:44.832
in my hands, I think
it would be a very effective tool.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.166
Peggy, no.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.417
This could work, Hank.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.503
The neighborhood
would go back to the way it was,

18:49.586 --> 18:53.340
housing prices will stabilize
and Enrique can afford to stay.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.801
Or how about this?

18:55.884 --> 18:57.678
What do hipsters like?

18:57.761 --> 18:59.138
Cool things.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.683
So we invent a place called "Cooltown."

19:02.766 --> 19:03.976
In Cooltown,

19:04.059 --> 19:07.646
music's always playing,
and everybody drives convertibles.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.107
Ugh, it sounds like Austin.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.359
Bobby, you are almost right!

19:12.442 --> 19:13.443
Really?

19:13.527 --> 19:14.528
Almost.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.697
The thing that I've learned
about these people

19:16.780 --> 19:19.158
is that it's not about
where they want to be,

19:19.241 --> 19:21.702
but where they don't want to be.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.078
Brilliant!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.836
Welcome to the neighborhood!

19:31.795 --> 19:32.838
Who are you?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.590
Hey, man, we're dang ol' neighbors, man.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.300
Talking 'bout... go watch football, man.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.760
Come on, talkin' 'bout
"Go Longhorns," man.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.305
So you guys want to come over for Grey's?

19:41.388 --> 19:43.265
Idol? How about game night?

19:43.348 --> 19:44.850
Aah.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.083
Hey, neighbor!

20:10.167 --> 20:11.335
I'm Bill!

20:20.844 --> 20:22.721
-
I own my own house.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.139
I am a homeowner.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.725
Now I pay mortgage instead of rent.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.185
I'm building equity!

20:28.268 --> 20:29.436
We should celebrate!

20:29.519 --> 20:31.563
Well, I'm really happy for you, Enrique.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.815
But maybe you should lay low for a while.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.818
My neighbors and I have to keep pretending
like we live here

20:36.902 --> 20:38.779
until we get rid of the rest of the guys.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.864
Yeah, then we're going to celebrate!

20:40.948 --> 20:44.785
You heard of a housewarming,
this is going to be a house inferno!

20:44.868 --> 20:47.788
How about for now
we celebrate with a beer.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.584
Yep.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.669
Yep.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.088
Maybe just some donkey rides for the kids.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.095
Thanks, Mr. Hill. This is really great.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.724
Now then, I believe
we have a little unfinished business.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.937
And now I'd like to say a few words
about a young girl...

21:12.020 --> 21:16.066
uh, I mean a young woman named Inez...

21:54.271 --> 21:56.898
-<i>They put salmon
in the fish tacos, Hank!</i>
