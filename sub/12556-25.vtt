00:09.968 --> 00:12.426
<i>(narrator) YOU'RE TRA VEL ING'
THROUGH ANOTHER DIMENSION.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:15.426
<i>A DIMENSION NOT ONLY OF SIGHT
AND SOUND, BUT OF MIND.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:19.180
<i>A JOURNEY INTO A WONDROUS LAND WHOSE
BOUNDARIES ARE THAT OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:19.228 --> 00:23.017
<i>THAT'S THE SIGNPOST UP AHEAD. YOUR
NEXT STOP, THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:30.687
I CAN TELL YOU, GENTLEMEN, THE MOST IDIOTIC
THING OCCURRED IN THE MARKET TODAY.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.819
JUST IDIOTIC. I'\/E BEEN DOING A
LITTLE DABBLING IN THE SYNDICATE.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.276
IT HAS SOME OIL HOLDINGS IN
THE VVESTERN PART OF TEXAS.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.032
<i>JACK BREWER HANDLES OUR NEW
YORK OPERPCHON FOR US.</i>

00:39.081 --> 00:42.244
ANYVVAY, HE CAME ON THE FLOOR TODAY.
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE THERE.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.372
THIS WAS ABOUT 10:00,
10:30 THIS MORNING.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.295
HE HAS A SHEAF OF PAPERS IN
HIS HAND HE VVA\/ES TO ME.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.500
NOVV, I CAN ASSURE YOU IF THERE IS
ANYBODY THAT I DON'T VVANT TO SEE

00:51.593 --> 00:54.551
BEFORE NOON ON ANY GIVEN
DAY, IT IS JACK BREVVER.

00:54.638 --> 00:59.098
HE'S A RAUCOUS SORT, A LITTLE CRUDE,
NOUVEAU RICHE. YOU KNOVV THE TYPE.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.643
CHARLIE, OLD MAN, YOU DON'T MIND
IF I SIT HERE, DO YOU, BOY?

01:02.729 --> 01:05.107
<i>WELL, WELL, WHERE WAS I?
OH, YES, JACK BREWER.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:08.273
<i>HE, UH, WALKS ACROSS THE FLOOR
TO ME AND WITH AN INTENSE VOICE,</i>

01:08.360 --> 01:11.523
<i>A VOICE ABSOLUTELY
SHAKING WITH INTENSITY.</i>

01:11.613 --> 01:13.650
HE SIDLES UP TO ME
AND HE WHISPERS,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.323
HE'S GOT THE MOST MISERABLE HABIT
OF VVHISPERING SOTTO \/OOE,

01:16.410 --> 01:19.243
SO THAT EVERYONE IN THE VVORLD CAN
HEAR HIM. ANYVVAY, HE SAYS TO ME,

01:19.288 --> 01:21.746
<i>"JIM, I GOTTA SCRAPE UP
A QUARTER OF A MILLION,</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:25.496
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT OAN HANDLE IT
FOR ME." THIS IS BREVVER SPEAKING TO ME.

01:25.586 --> 01:29.500
<i>A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS! AND I
AM SUPPOSED TO SCRAPE IT UP FOR HIM.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:33.174
<i>I MEAN, IAM SUPPOSED TO SCRAPE IT UP
AS THOUGH IT WERE SOME KIND OF RESIDUE</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:35.922
THAT COULD BE LITERALLY
SCOOPED UP OFF A FLOOR!

01:35.971 --> 01:39.180
<i>TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, HE ARRIVES
AT THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE MORNING,</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:42.179
<i>ABSOLUTELY THE BUSIEST
TIME, AND HE SAYS TO ME,</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:44.431
<i>"JIM, I'VE GOT AN
OPPORTUNITY TO CORNER--</i>

01:44.521 --> 01:46.137
I JUST GOT
YOUR LETTER.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.973
SH! OUR YOUNG FRIEND
IS DISCOURSING AGAIN.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.525
I LOOKED A LITTLE
ASKANCE AT HIM

01:51.612 --> 01:55.230
BECAUSE THE BOOR WOULDN'T KNOVV A CORNER
OF THE MARKET FROM A RAILROAD ROUNDHOUSE!

01:55.324 --> 01:58.942
THE ONLY THING VVORSE THAN HIS
TALKING SO MUCH IS HIS TRANSPARENCY.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.198
IN ABOUT
3O SECONDS, ALFRED,

02:01.288 --> 02:05.998
HE VVILL VERY NONCHALANTLY ASK FOR A
LOAN FROM ANYBODY VVITHIN EARSHOT.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.872
AS A MATTER OF FACT, JUST
LAST VVEEK HE ASKED ME

02:08.961 --> 02:11.294
FOR THE LOAN OF A QUARTER
OF A MILLION DOLLARS.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.207
THE LETTER YOU SENT ME IS THE MOST
INCREDIBLE THING I HA\/E E\/ER READ.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.793
ARCHIE, WE'RE OLD FRIENDS.
I MUST TELL YOU THAT--

02:16.887 --> 02:22.633
MY COMMUNICATION TO YOU, ALFRED, VVAS NOT
AS AN OLD FRIEND, BUT AS MY LAVVYER.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.722
IS THE WAGER
I HAVE IN MIND LEGAL?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.803
NO WAGER IS LEGAL
IN THIS STATE.

02:27.898 --> 02:32.017
VVELL, IS IT AGAINST THE LAVV, THEN?
ANYTHING CRIMINAL IN IT?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.147
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING
CRIMINAL IN IT, NO.

02:34.196 --> 02:39.566
ALFRED, THAT IS EXACTLY VVHAT
I VVANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.654
<i>[rings bell,
man continues talking]</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:46.739
FRANKLIN, WOULD YOU TAKE
THIS NOTE ACROSS THE ROOM

02:46.833 --> 02:49.040
TO YOUNG MR.
TENNYSON OVER THERE.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.586
YOU TELL HIM IT'S FROM ME. ASK
HIM TO READ IT IMMEDIATELY.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.586
WHY, YES, SIR.

02:55.676 --> 02:59.044
<i>(narrator) THE NOTE THAT THIS MAN
IS CARRYING ACROSS A CLUB ROOM</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:01.674
<i>IS IN THE FORM
OF A PROPOSED WAGER,</i>

03:01.723 --> 03:05.216
<i>BUT IT'S THE KIND OF WAGER
THAT COMES WITHOUT PRECEDENT.</i>

03:05.310 --> 03:08.348
<i>IT STANDS ALONE IN THE
ANNALS OF BET MAKING</i>

03:08.397 --> 03:12.356
<i>AS THE STRANGEST GAME OF CHANCE
EVER OFFERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER.</i>

03:12.401 --> 03:14.938
IN JUST A MOMENT, VVE'LL SEE
THE TERMS OF THE VVAGER

03:15.028 --> 03:17.190
AND VVHAT YOUNG MR.
TENNYSON DOES ABOUT IT.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.864
AND IN THE PROCESS, VVE'LL VVITNESS
ALL PARTIES SPIN A VVHEEL OF CHANCE

03:20.951 --> 03:25.946
IN A VERY BIZARRE CASINO
CALLED THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

03:28.709 --> 03:33.203
DO YOU KNOVV VVHAT IOOULD DO VVITH A QUARTER
OF A MILLION DOLLARS IN A DEAL LIKE THIS?

03:33.255 --> 03:36.213
VVELL, I CAN TELL YOU THIS. I
COULD TREBLE IT, QUADRUPLE IT.

03:36.258 --> 03:40.593
<i>WITH AN INITIAL INVESTMENT OF A QUARTER OF A
MILLION DOLLARS, I COULD TAKE THIS PLASTICS--</i>

03:40.679 --> 03:44.593
EXCUSE ME, MR. TENNYSON. A NOTE
FOR YOU FROM COLONEL TAYLOR.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.015
JUST PUT IT DOWN
SOMEWHERE, FRANKLIN.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.936
EXCUSE ME, MR. TENNYSON, HIS INSTRUCTIONS
ARE THAT YOU READ IT IMMEDIATELY.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.184
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.453
ACTS LIKE HE HAD
SEEN A GHOST.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.997
THIS IS-THIS IS
ABSOLUTE NONSENSE.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.458
WHAT ABOUT IT, TENNYSON?

04:13.545 --> 04:17.083
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE? I MEAN,
REALLY, COLONEL, IF IT IS A JOKE,

04:17.132 --> 04:19.339
IT SUGGESTS A SENSE OF
HUMOR QUITE BEYOND ME.

04:19.426 --> 04:23.920
IT IS NOTA JOKE. YOU KNOVV ME
REASONABLY VVELL, TENNYSON.

04:24.014 --> 04:28.929
<i>YOU KNOW THAT HUMOR IS PERHAPS THE LEAST
DEVELOPED ASPECT OF MY CHARACTER.</i>

04:29.019 --> 04:32.262
I AM QUITE SERIOUS.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.271
WOULD YOU MIND
TERRIBLY, TENNYSON,

04:38.320 --> 04:42.109
IF I AOOUAINTED THE MEMBERS
VVITH MY PROPOSITION?

04:42.157 --> 04:46.367
VVELL, THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS,
COLONEL, QUITE YOUR BUSINESS.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.787
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU VVILL
MAKE YOURSELF HIGHLY SUSPECT.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.118
I'LL TAKE THAT RISK.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.208
I PROPOSE A WAGER
TO MR. TENNYSON HERE.

04:58.298 --> 05:04.135
THE VVAGER IS TO TAKE THE FOLLOVVING FORM.
I VVILL BET HIM $500,000.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.053
<i>[men murmur]</i>

05:06.139 --> 05:09.348
THAT HE CANNOT REMAIN
SILENT FOR ONE YEAR.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.894
THE WAGER CARRIES WITH IT
THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:

05:13.980 --> 05:16.062
HE WILL BE PLACED IN
A ROOM FOR OBSERVATION

05:16.149 --> 05:19.062
BY ME OR BY ANYONE OF
US, AT OUR DISCRETION.

05:19.152 --> 05:23.567
HE VVILL BE FURNISHED VVITH ANYTHING
HE DESIRES BY VVAY OF DIVERSION.

05:23.657 --> 05:28.743
BUT HE VVILL NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK
ONE SINGLE VVORD FOR 12 MONTHS.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.662
NOT ONE SINGLE WORD.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.705
<i>HE WILL MAKE
HIS WANTS KNOWN</i>

05:33.792 --> 05:37.535
<i>IN WRITING,
NOT BY VOICE.</i>

05:37.629 --> 05:40.496
WHAT ABOUT IT, TENNYSON?

05:40.549 --> 05:44.383
VVELL, MAY I ASK VVHAT IS
THE REASON FOR THIS VVAGER?

05:44.469 --> 05:48.554
VVHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY MIGHT
HORRIFY THE AVERAGE PERSON,

05:48.640 --> 05:52.599
BUT TO SOMEONE AS INSENSITIVE AS YOU
IT PROBABLY VVON'T MEAN A THING.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.061
I DISLIKE YOU
INTENSELY, TENNYSON.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.860
IT GOES MUCH BEYOND
THE ORDINARY DISTASTE

06:03.905 --> 06:06.442
I FEEL FOR SOMEONE
WITHOUT BREEDING,

06:06.533 --> 06:09.776
WITHOUT PRINCIPLES,
WITHOUT MANNERS.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.862
YOUR VOICE HAS
BECOME INTOLERABLE.

06:12.914 --> 06:18.785
I SIT HERE EACH NIGHT AND THE
SOUND OF IT MAKES ME VVINCE!

06:18.879 --> 06:23.874
I CANNOT ASK YOU TO RESIGN FROM THE CLUB.
I HAVEN'T GOT THAT RIGHT.

06:23.925 --> 06:28.840
SO IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I'D BE
VVILLING TO OFFER A LARGE SUM OF MONEY

06:30.223 --> 06:34.308
JUST TO HAVE SOME QUIET.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.558
<i>YOU SEE, TENNYSON, YOU COULD NOT
POSSIBLY REMAIN SILENT FOR A YEAR.</i>

06:38.607 --> 06:40.974
<i>IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE.</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:45.402
YOU'RE A SHALLOW, TALKATIVE,
EMPTY-HEADED NE'ER-DO-WELL.

06:45.488 --> 06:49.152
<i>AND TO REMAIN SILENT
WOULD DESTROY YOU.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:53.611
<i>SO WHAT I ASSUME WILL HAPPEN, YOU
WILL PERHAPS WITHSTAND THE PRESSURES</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:57.824
FOR THREE OR FOUR WEEKS,
MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS

06:57.918 --> 07:01.832
AND THEN YOU VVILL SUCCUMB.
THAT'S, AGAIN, YOUR NATURE.

07:01.922 --> 07:05.836
IN THE MEANTIME,
IWILL DERIVE,

07:05.926 --> 07:09.419
OH, SEVERAL MONTHS
OF EXQUISITE SILENCE.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.129
[chuckHng]

07:12.223 --> 07:14.260
WELL, TENNYSON,

07:14.351 --> 07:17.264
DOES IT APPEAL TO
YOUR SPORTING BLOOD?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.849
ODDLY ENOUGH, IT DOES APPEAL
TO MY SPORTING BLOOD.

07:19.940 --> 07:25.185
NOVV, THAT, TOO, IS PATENTLY RIDIOULOUS.
THERE'S NOTHING SPORTING ABOUT YOU, TENNYSON.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.021
I HAPPEN TO KNOVV THAT YOU'RE DELIVERING
YOUR NIGHTLY FINANCIAL FOLDEROL

07:29.115 --> 07:31.368
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN
DESPERATE STRAITS.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.442
YOU'VE RUN THROUGH
YOUR INHERITANCE,

07:33.495 --> 07:35.827
YOUR DEBTS ARE
INSURMOUNTABLE,

07:35.914 --> 07:39.623
AND YOU'D DO PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING FOR MONEY.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.997
EXCEPT, PERHAPS, TO
REMAIN SILENT FOR A YEAR.

07:43.088 --> 07:47.503
IF THIS VVERE EUROPE, COLONEL, OR THE
COMPANY VVERE A BIT MORE SOPHISTIOATED,

07:47.592 --> 07:51.210
I SHOULD BE FORCED TO IN\/ITE YOU OUT
FOR THE THINGS YOU'\/E SAID TO ME.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.218
<i>THE GROUND RULES HERE, HOWEVER,
ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.</i>

07:55.308 --> 07:59.472
I CAN EITHER IGNORE YOU
OR CALL YOUR BLUFF.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.897
VVELL, I CHOOSE TO DO THE LATTER.
I ACCEPT YOUR VVAGER.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.021
UH, JUST A
FEW QUESTIONS.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.073
WHERE AM I
TO BE INCARCERATED?

08:13.159 --> 08:16.242
VVELL, IN THE OLD GAME ROOM DOVVNSTAIRS.
IT ISN'T BEING USED.

08:16.329 --> 08:20.197
VVITH THE PERMISSION OF THE BOARD OF
GOVERNORS, I'LL HA\/E SOME VVORK DONE ON IT.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.750
YOU'LL BE IN A GLASS-ENCLOSED
LIVING ROOM AND BEDROOM.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.499
THERE WILL BE MICROPHONES
PLACED ALL AROUND THE ROOM

08:26.548 --> 08:29.040
WHICH YOU ARE
TO LEAVE UNTOUCHED.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.923
YOUR EVERY MOVEMENT VVILL BE
RECORDED AND SO VVILL YOUR VOIOE

08:33.013 --> 08:35.846
WHEN YOU DECIDE
TO GIVE UP.

08:35.932 --> 08:41.928
<i>YOU WILL PERMIT ME OR ANYONE OF
US TO OBSERVE YOU AT ANY TIME.</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:44.684
WHEN, UH, IS THIS
SUPPOSED TO START?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.857
VVELL, THE ROOM COULD BE
PREPARED BY TOMORROW NIGHT.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.893
I'VE MADE ALL THE
NECESSARY INQUIRIES.

08:49.988 --> 08:53.026
YOU COULD ENTER
ANYTIME AFTER 10:00 P.M.

08:53.116 --> 08:58.202
AND SO, AT 10:OO
P.M., JUNE 3, 1962

08:58.246 --> 09:00.578
YOU MAY LEAVE THE ROOM.

09:00.665 --> 09:05.626
<i>AT THAT TIME I WILL HAVE A CHECK
FOR $500,000 WAITING FOR YOU,</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:09.125
ASSUMING, OF COURSE,
THAT THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENS

09:09.215 --> 09:12.833
AND YOU'RE ABLE TO REMAIN
SILENT FOR THOSE 12 MONTHS.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.420
I'LL BE BACK
TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:18.433 --> 09:22.722
UH, COLONEL, I VVOULD LIKE TO
HA\/E THAT CHECK CERTIFIED

09:22.771 --> 09:24.978
AND PLACED ON
DEPOSIT IN MY NAME.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.399
A PHOTOSTAT OF IT AVAILABLE AND
VVITNESSED BY EVERY MEMBER OF THIS CLUB.

THAT MIGHT BE THE USUAL PROCEDURE
IN A FISH MARKET ORA PAVVN SHOP.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.816
BUT NOT IN THIS CLUB
AND NOT WITH ME.

09:36.910 --> 09:42.326
MY CREDIT IS VVELL-KNOVVN SO IS MY HONOR,
AS E\/ERY MEMBER HERE VVILL \/OUOH FOR.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.828
THERE WILL BE NO CHECK
PLACED ON DEPOSIT.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.162
YOU'LL HAVE
TO TAKE MY WORD.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.922
I SEE.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.172
IT'S MY COURAGE
AGAINST YOUR CREDIT.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.927
VVELL, A YEAR FROM TOMORROW
NIGHT BOTH OAN BE PROVED.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.928
FRANKLIN, GET
ME MY COAT.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.760
YES, SIR.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.359
TENNYSON, I'\/E KNOVVN COLONEL
TAYLOR FOR A LONG TIME.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.864
THIS IS NOT
A CAPRICIOUS MAN.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.869
I WARN YOU, HE IS
IN DEADLY EARNEST.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.202
DO YOU KNOVV MY VVIFE, SIR?
HER NAME IS DORIS.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.879
SHE'S A LOVELY THING.
FRAIL, BEAUTIFUL, FRAGILE.

10:32.966 --> 10:37.551
LIKE A CAMEO BROOCH, BUT HER
TASTES RUN TO UNFRAGILE THINGS.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.720
SIZABLE BAUBLES TO
SIZABLE PRICE TAGS.

10:40.807 --> 10:45.347
SHE SHOPS AT TIFFANY'S THE VVAY
OTHER VVOMEN ENTER A SUPERMARKET.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.725
MY MISERABLE MISFORTUNE IS THAT I HAPPEN
TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE VVITH HER.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.979
I AM ALSO DESPERATE
IN NEED OF MONEY.

10:53.069 --> 10:57.028
I MAY SOUND MELODRAMATIC,
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.

11:20.096 --> 11:24.260
ANY TIME NOVV, MR. TENNYSON.
ANY TIME.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.658

YES, SIR.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.559
IS HE EATING WELL,
APPETITE GOOD?

12:09.604 --> 12:13.598
<i>NOT VERY MUCH UP TO A WEEK AGO,

<i>WELL, THAT'S NICE. AND I HOPE
HE STAYS IN PERFECT HEALTH.</i>

12:18.196 --> 12:21.564
<i>I WOULDN'T WANT THIS EXPERIENCE

12:21.658 --> 12:25.151
QUITE THE CONTRARY, SIR. HE
SEEMS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.739

VVEEKS TODAY THAT HE'S BEEN IN THERE.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.960
<i>NINE WEEKS?</i>

12:32.043 --> 12:34.375
<i>WELL, THAT'S REALLY
QUITE INCREDIBLE.</i>

12:34.462 --> 12:39.252
<i>I GAVE HIM FOUR WEEKS POSSIBLY,
TO HOLD OUT, SIX AT THE OUTSIDE.</i>

12:39.342 --> 12:42.334
NINE WEEKS!

12:42.428 --> 12:46.342
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE GRISTLE
THERE THAN I GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.819
WILL THERE BE
ANYTHING ELSE, SIR?

14:08.264 --> 14:12.178
OH, HELLO, ALFRED. FRANKLIN
TOLD ME YOU VVERE VVAITING.

HOVV LONG ARE YOU GONNA KEEP ON VVITH
THIS-THIS PROLONGED PRACTICAL JOKE?

14:24.655 --> 14:28.193
WELL, NOT MUCH LONGER.
THANK YOU, FRANKLIN.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.696
YOU SHOULD SEE
OUR BOY DOWN THERE.

14:30.787 --> 14:35.372
FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS, NOT A SOUND
OUT OF HIM. IT'S INCREDIBLE.

14:35.458 --> 14:39.452
THAT FOP VVON'T TAKE IT FOR ANOTHER MONTH.
THIS I'LL GUARANTEE YOU.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.037
FOR YOUR SAKE,
I HOPE THAT'S THE CASE.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.548
MY SAKE?

14:44.634 --> 14:47.467
YOU HAVE
THE MONEY, ARCHIE?

14:47.553 --> 14:50.295
I FIND THAT
INSULTING, ALFRED.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.722
I'M SORRY IF IT IS.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.050
I THINK HE'S GONNA
BEAT YOU, ARCHIE.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.978
I THINK THAT BOY DOVVN THERE IS GONNA
REMAIN SILENT FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.558
AND I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA OWE HIM $500,000.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.610
I JUST HOPE
YOU'VE GOT IT.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.760
YOU CAN HEAR ME,
TENNYSON, CAN'T YOU?

15:29.804 --> 15:32.466
I'VE BEEN GIVING THIS
CONSIDERABLE THOUGHT.

15:32.557 --> 15:36.016
YOU FULFILLED YOUR PART
OF THE BARGAIN ADMIRABLY.

15:36.102 --> 15:40.847
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU HA\/E
COMPLETELY SURPRISED ME, TENNYSON.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.524
BUT THE FACT IS I FEEL THE
VVHOLE THING HAS GONE TOO FAR.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.352
IT'S BECOMING INHUMAN.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.860
I'M PREPARED TO OFFER
YOU $1,000 DOLLARS

15:50.950 --> 15:53.282
AND YOU MAY
WALK OUT TODAY.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.820
RIGHT THIS MOMENT,
IF YOU CHOOSE.

16:22.899 --> 16:27.518
IT'S GOING TO BE AN EARLY
SPRING THIS YEAR, TENNYSON.

16:27.612 --> 16:31.071
YOU OUGHT TO SEE IT.

16:31.157 --> 16:35.651
IN THAT TIME OF THE YEAR VVHEN A
YOUNG MAN'S FANCY LIGHTLY TURNS--

16:35.703 --> 16:38.741
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN I DO.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.823
AND YOUNG LADIES, TOO.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.083
FOR EXAMPLE YOUR WIFE.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.586
SHE MUST BE LONELY
FOR YOU, TENNYSON.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.338
DESPERATELY LONELY.

16:53.429 --> 16:59.095
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE-SHE HAS
BEEN SEEN VVITH OTHER YOUNG MEN.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.769
IT'S ODD SHE HASN'T PAID
YOU A VISIT, ISN'T IT?

17:02.855 --> 17:05.186
DON'T YOU
THINK IT'S ODD?

17:05.233 --> 17:09.271
I HAPPEN TO KNOVV YOU'VE WRITTEN HER
MANY NOTES REQUESTING A \/ISIT.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.444
SHE HASN'T RESPONDED,
EVEN TO THE NOTES.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.867
YOU MAY LOSE
YOUR WIFE, TENNYSON.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.412
<i>I HOPE YOU'RE
FULLY AWARE OF THAT.</i>

17:20.498 --> 17:22.865
<i>WHILE YOU STAY
HERE BEHIND GLASS,</i>

17:22.959 --> 17:26.577
<i>THE VERY REASON FOR ALL YOUR AGONY
MAY BE SLIPPING AWAY FROM YOU.</i>

17:29.131 --> 17:32.874
VVHY DON'T YOU LEA\/E, TENNYSON?
VVHY DON'T YOU LEA\/E RIGHT NOVV?

17:32.969 --> 17:36.963
IT STILL MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
TO SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.244
<i>[voice echoing] TENNYSON,
I SAW YOUR WIFE AGAIN.</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:05.415
<i>SHE WAS GETTING INTO A
LITTLE EUROPEAN SPORTS CAR.</i>

18:05.459 --> 18:09.293
THERE VVAS A, YOU KNOVV, A
NICE YOUNG FELLOVV DRIVING IT.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.623
<i>YOUR WIFE, WIFE, WIFE,
WIFE, WIFE, WIFE, WIFE.</i>

18:14.343 --> 18:17.256
<i>TODAY IS APRIL
FOOLS' DAY, TENNYSON.</i>

18:17.305 --> 18:20.423
YOU REMEMBER APRIL FOOLS' DAY.
I THINK IT VVAS NAMED FOR YOU,

18:20.516 --> 18:23.975
FOR ONLY A FOOL WOULD STAY
IN THERE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE

18:24.061 --> 18:28.180
KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT'S
HAPPENING ON THE OUTSIDE.

18:28.274 --> 18:32.768
YOUR WIFE, I MEAN, TENNYSON,
YOUR WIFE, WIFE, WIFE.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.197
TENNYSON, THIS
NONSENSE MUST CEASE!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.945
YOU'\/E GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
YOU REALLY DO.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.745
VVHY, I COULD TELL YOU SOME
STORIES ABOUT YOUR VVIFE.

18:46.042 --> 18:50.707
HOVV ABOUT IT, TENNYSON? I MIGHT SEE
MY VVAY CLEAR TO GIVING YOU $5,000.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.709
THAT WOULD PAY OFF
A LOT OF YOUR DEBTS.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.632
AND A LITTLE BRACELET
FOR YOUR VVIFE.

18:56.719 --> 19:01.464
<i>SOMETHING TO COMPENSATE
FOR THE MONTHS OF LONELINESS.</i>

19:01.557 --> 19:05.391
<i>HOW ABOUT IT,
TENNYSON? $5,000?</i>

19:05.478 --> 19:08.561
$6,000, TENNYSON.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.813
<i>YOU'RE AN IDIOT, YOU
KNOW THAT, TENNYSON?</i>

19:14.904 --> 19:17.817
<i>YOU'RE GOING OUT OF YOUR MIND IN THERE.
I KNOW YOU ARE.</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:20.072
YOU'RE READY TO
CRAWL UP THE WALLS.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.402
<i>LISTEN, TENNYSON, YOU CANNOT
STAY IN THERE ONE MORE HOUR.</i>

19:23.496 --> 19:25.954
<i>NOT ANOTHER HALF HOUR.</i>

19:31.754 --> 19:34.246
<i>(man) I WOULDN'T
HAVE BELIEVED IT.</i>

19:34.340 --> 19:37.708
<i>A YEAR IN THAT ROOM AND
NOT ONE WORD OUT OF HIM.</i>

19:37.802 --> 19:41.591
<i>TWO MINUTES IS ALL THE POOR DEVIL
HAS GOT NOW. TWO MORE MINUTES.</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:45.094
<i>LOOK AT ARCHIE. NOT THE FACE
OF A HAPPY MAN, WOULD YOU SAY?</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:48.518
A RATHER MONUMENTAL
OCCASION, ISN'T IT, ARCHIE?

19:48.604 --> 19:52.689
<i>TWELVE MONTHS AGO TO THE
MOMENT YOU DESTROYED YOURSELF</i>

19:52.775 --> 19:54.732
MUCH AS I TOLD
YOU YOU WOULD.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.937
YOUR LITTLE REMINDERS
ARE GRATUITOUS, ALFRED.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.068
BESIDES, IT'S
NOT YET 10:00.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.115
WHETHER IT IS
OR WHETHER IT ISN'T,

20:03.202 --> 20:06.536
THE DESTRUCTION I'M TALKING
ABOUT HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.958
THERE HAVE BEEN
UGLY RUMORS, ARCHIE,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.078
THINGS YOU'VE
DONE TO HIM.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.126
LIKE LITTLE ASIDES
INNUENDOS, SUGGESTIONS,

20:14.213 --> 20:17.046
GOSSIP ABOUT HIS WIFE.

20:17.133 --> 20:20.046
YOU PLACE SUCH A
PREMIUM ON HONOR, ARCHIE,

20:20.136 --> 20:22.548
BUT YOU HAVEN'T ACTED
LIKE AN HONORABLE MAN.

20:22.596 --> 20:26.965
PLEASE, DON'T GO TO THE TROUBLE OF
DENYING IT. I'M SURE MUCH OF IT IS TRUE.

20:27.059 --> 20:31.053
BUT THE UGLY AFFAIR HAS PROVED
TVVO THINGS HASN'T IT, ARCHIE?

20:31.147 --> 20:34.731
THAT THAT BOY DOVVN THERE IS STRONGER
THAN YOU GAVE HIM CREDIT FOR,

20:34.817 --> 20:38.310
AND YOU ARE
CONSIDERABLY WEAKER.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.148
HOVV COULD HE HA\/E DONE IT?
HOVV COULD HE HA\/E DONE IT?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.072
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

20:47.163 --> 20:51.578
<i>[clock bell
rings ten times]</i>

21:34.835 --> 21:38.373
YOU, UH, HA\/E ME AT A DISADVANTAGE, MR.
TENNYSON.

21:39.882 --> 21:43.375
IN A RATHER
COMPROMISING SITUATION.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.710
YOU FORCE ME
INTO A POSITION OF

21:47.097 --> 21:49.805
RATHER DISTASTEFUL CANDOR.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.220
THE TRUTH IS
I AM A FRAUD.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.806
<i>I HAVEN'T ANY MONEY.</i>

21:57.900 --> 22:01.393
<i>I OFFERED YOU
$1,000. THEN $5, 000.</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:05.230
I VVOULD HA\/E HAD TO GO OUT INTO THE
STREET TO BEG E\/EN THAT AMOUNT,

22:05.324 --> 22:08.567
LET ALONE A HALF
A MILLION DOLLARS.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.238
IT'S TRUE THAT
I HAVE PRIDE,

22:13.332 --> 22:16.245
BEARING, TASTE,
EXCEPTIONAL BREEDING,

22:18.921 --> 22:22.835
<i>BUT I LOST MOST OF MY
MONEY SOME YEARS AGO.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:31.006
NOW YOU HAVE FORCED ME
TO UNCOVER THE SITUATION,

22:31.100 --> 22:35.185
PROVING, MR. TENNYSON, PROVING
THAT OF THE TVVO OF US,

22:35.229 --> 22:39.268
YOU ARE BY FAR
THE MORE SUBSTANTIAL.

22:44.947 --> 22:49.737
AND I VVILL NATURALLY RESIGN. I VVILL NOT
ASK YOU TO SUFFER MY PRESENCE ANY LONGER.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.246
TENNYSON, YOU CAN TALK,
YOUR TIME IS UP.

22:55.332 --> 22:59.166
YOU CAN TALK, GURGLE, SING,
CHORTLE, ANYTHING YOU WANT.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.378
<i>(man) WHAT'S HE WRITING?
WHAT IS HE DOING?</i>

23:06.468 --> 23:09.426
<i>WHY DOESN'T HE TALK?</i>

23:12.349 --> 23:13.726
WHAT DOES IT
SAY, ARCHIE?

23:13.767 --> 23:15.053
WHAT DID
HE WRITE?

23:15.144 --> 23:17.306
WHY DIDN'T HE
SAY SOMETHING?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.602

<i>EVEN WITH LOADED
