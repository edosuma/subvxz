01:32.802 --> 01:36.555
<i>The Girl Without Hands</i>

05:29.580 --> 05:31.457
Are you that hungry?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.752
Have you no bread?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.594
I have neither bread nor water.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.430
My purse is as dry as the river.

05:47.473 --> 05:51.643
I can fill your purse
if you give me what's behind your mill.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.188
My apple tree?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.941
What is behind your mill.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.820
Without my apples,
I'll have no food.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.908
Why live on apples
when you are rich?

06:08.243 --> 06:10.662
If you're thirsty for wealth,

06:11.288 --> 06:12.623
well then...

06:13.832 --> 06:15.167
drink.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.888
Water...

07:11.682 --> 07:12.850
No.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.519
Gold.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.606
How did it happen?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.108
I don't know.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.360
There was a gust of wind.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.155
And where's your father?

07:27.573 --> 07:29.992
He took his axe into the forest.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.619
All this gold...

07:35.080 --> 07:37.124
Our life is going to change.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.793
Run and tell your father.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.135
This gold is so shiny...

07:48.552 --> 07:51.096
yet it seems so dirty.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.056
Dad!

07:56.810 --> 08:00.481
Look, look!
The water has come back.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.566
It's not water.

08:12.534 --> 08:16.497
We're rich forever!

08:19.249 --> 08:22.377
What's behind your mill?
What's behind it?

08:22.544 --> 08:26.673
Yes, why eat apples when we're rich?!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.592
Your daughter was there.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.512
- My daughter?
- Yes, your daughter.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.306
In that tree you sold so dearly.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.600
My daughter...

08:37.476 --> 08:39.520
She was sold, too.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.385
Your new room's ready. Come on.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.640
My destiny is tied up with this tree.
I won't leave it.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.017
Come have a look anyway!

10:43.185 --> 10:44.353
Come on.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.356
I made it for you.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.192
Look.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.986
Look how it shines!

10:54.237 --> 10:55.572
It's your room.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.741
You'll be fine here.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.494
Just fine, you'll see.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.599
I'm the master of the house.
And you?

12:46.683 --> 12:49.311
Remember the pact in the forest?

12:50.020 --> 12:52.522
Isn't that gold refreshing?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.026
It is.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.361
I'm delighted.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.616
I've come for my dues.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.452
It won't take long.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.635
She's too clean.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.386
I can't take her.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.097
Stop her washing, you hear?

13:26.765 --> 13:30.185
Like that gold, I want her dirty.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.064
See you soon.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.776
If you want to keep your gold,

13:38.401 --> 13:39.861
do what's necessary.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.055
How can you give away
your own daughter?

14:49.306 --> 14:50.807
I gave my word.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.060
We received what we were promised.
We'll lose it all.

14:55.604 --> 14:58.481
We were poor for so many years.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.735
She'll be well treated.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.320
Well treated!

15:03.486 --> 15:05.071
By that devil?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.907
Oh, don't exaggerate.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.826
That gold has changed you.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.494
Give it back.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.457
We were poor,
but it wouldn't have lasted.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.126
The water would have come back.

15:21.546 --> 15:22.714
Give it back.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.967
There's nothing I can do.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.052
It's you.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.804
So you say.

17:36.639 --> 17:40.393
My wife died yesterday.
Won't you leave us in peace?

17:41.770 --> 17:45.023
You wanted to be rich.
How could you be in peace?

17:47.108 --> 17:50.278
Go on, bring her down.
She's ready.

17:50.862 --> 17:53.323
I can smell her stench from here.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.077
Come down.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.661
Louder!

17:58.787 --> 18:00.455
You're a father, damn you!

18:00.622 --> 18:03.083
Come down. Come down!

18:04.209 --> 18:06.169
- You won't?
- That's it.

18:06.336 --> 18:07.253
You'll see.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.671
Good.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.117
What a fine thing
to see a man at work!

18:55.552 --> 18:58.555
Her foul odor masks her defense:

18:58.721 --> 19:01.558
she's wept on her hands,
so I can't take her.

19:02.892 --> 19:03.935
Never mind.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.604
Cut off her hands.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.065
I gave you my word,

19:10.066 --> 19:13.361
but I can't cut off my daughter's hands.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.739
Cut or I'll take you.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.200
And you'll have lost everything.

19:19.409 --> 19:20.702
Father!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.835
Father, here are my hands.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.004
Do as you will.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.427
I'm your daughter,
I don't want to cause you misfortune.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.263
You are all I have left.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.677
Miller,

20:19.844 --> 20:22.555
you did your duty
like a good father.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.599
Have no regrets.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.271
Girl, tell your father
your hands are no use to you

20:30.563 --> 20:31.898
and he should enjoy

20:32.106 --> 20:33.858
his treasure as he sees fit.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.485
Be certain

20:35.568 --> 20:38.446
he will have sweet thoughts
for his daughter.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.451
Such a good girl!

20:44.869 --> 20:46.746
She cried on her stumps!

20:48.206 --> 20:50.833
Miller, why is your daughter

20:51.000 --> 20:53.544
so pure?
A tear is enough.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.174
I'll be generous.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.343
Keep your riches.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.471
I'll find a way to get my gains.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.640
With interest.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.777
Miller you are,
miller you will remain.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.241
All the world's gold
doesn't make you a lord.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.787
I reached out
for you to protect me.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.081
Did I have any choice?

21:30.540 --> 21:32.709
I throw my gold at your feet.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.836
My feet care not
for your gold.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.757
They just want to walk.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.427
As much as possible.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.971
Away from you.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.125
How come such a young girl

26:24.584 --> 26:27.086
comes to my bed?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.255
Are you here to die?

26:29.672 --> 26:31.048
On the contrary.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.925
I wish only to live.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.178
I just wanted to eat a pear.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.681
The pears are in an orchard.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.100
The orchard is in a garden.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.811
This garden belongs to a prince.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.397
You're not here by chance.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.210
Go.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.879
Eat.

27:10.546 --> 27:11.839
And live.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.587
Master!

27:52.672 --> 27:53.881
Master!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.717
Master, there's a strange glow

27:56.884 --> 27:58.260
in the garden.

27:59.053 --> 28:00.513
Did you see it?

28:01.764 --> 28:02.765
I did.

28:03.265 --> 28:04.350
She's an angel.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.977
The one I've been waiting for.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.481
Let's go find her.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.014
Master!

28:45.057 --> 28:46.142
Look.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.239
The river said
I could eat your pear.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.410
I was so hungry.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.328
Don't be scared.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.164
I want to help you.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.001
Let me look at you.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.379
Your hair is lighter

29:15.546 --> 29:16.881
than my barley.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.469
Your eyes brighter than my fountains.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.598
Your lips redder than my grapes.

29:31.020 --> 29:33.105
Your skin cooler than the river.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.611
You are so gentle.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.782
You are as I always dreamed.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.701
In my tree,

29:46.285 --> 29:48.621
I thought only of you, prince.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.831
You who talk to the river,

29:51.040 --> 29:52.458
I bid you welcome.

29:54.335 --> 29:57.713
You may now eat what you want.
That is my wish.

29:59.215 --> 30:01.509
This castle is your castle.

30:01.842 --> 30:02.551
No!

30:07.306 --> 30:09.391
You have come to me as you are.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.777
If you want hands,

30:19.944 --> 30:21.487
I will give you hands.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.614
I'll give you anything.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.823
The wedding of the prince
and the young girl

31:47.907 --> 31:49.700
was just like them.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.704
The local people were invited.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.706
And they all came.

31:56.749 --> 32:00.419
They drank our wine
and ate our fruit.

32:01.503 --> 32:04.131
The prince offered the girl

32:04.298 --> 32:07.635
carefully-crafted golden hands.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.347
The gold was so fine

32:11.513 --> 32:14.558
that they looked like real hands.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.511
What's wrong?

33:32.761 --> 33:35.097
I am sad for I must leave.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.350
War has been declared
on my distant borders.

33:39.143 --> 33:40.144
Look.

33:40.811 --> 33:42.438
My army is getting ready.

33:43.439 --> 33:44.857
I knew it.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.192
I dreamed of it all night.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.112
I dreamed of your skin.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.239
Don't worry.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.408
I'll be back soon,

33:54.616 --> 33:55.868
victorious.

34:06.462 --> 34:07.713
Take my lips.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.132
They're warmer than my hands.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.514
This war won't last long.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.309
Look after my land

34:20.516 --> 34:21.435
and my castle.

34:21.601 --> 34:23.312
I will look after your land

34:23.478 --> 34:26.398
so that when you return,
it may feed my master,

34:26.815 --> 34:29.650
my mistress,
and the child that will soon come.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.277
Thank you, gardener.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.489
If she is with child,
inform me immediately.

34:35.824 --> 34:36.784
Let's go.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.578
Wait!

34:39.911 --> 34:41.038
Wait!

34:45.876 --> 34:46.877
Wait...

34:48.087 --> 34:49.254
Wait...

37:24.534 --> 37:26.286
My prince gave me hands...

37:26.912 --> 37:28.705
but they are of no use to me.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.751
This war is endless.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.045
I'm bored in this castle.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.090
My prince went away months ago.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.883
The news is good.

37:41.510 --> 37:42.761
He's alive.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.848
I carry some of him inside.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.519
This child will look like him.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.188
I can't wait for his return.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.242
You won't have to wait long now.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.712
My baby!

39:42.631 --> 39:44.716
He'll be returned tomorrow.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.512
You must rest now.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.889
Thank you, gardener.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.141
I'm so happy.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.727
Tell the prince the good news.

39:55.894 --> 39:59.314
In the cold of the war,
my message will be a torch.

40:15.163 --> 40:16.373
Master...

40:16.915 --> 40:20.210
Your wife has given birth to a son.

40:21.962 --> 40:25.090
He has his mother's lips
and his father's hands.

40:25.674 --> 40:27.092
One can't imagine

40:27.259 --> 40:28.427
such perfection.

40:29.219 --> 40:31.430
The castle is transformed!

40:33.098 --> 40:35.350
We all hope
you will be back soon

40:35.976 --> 40:38.937
so that we may share
in the beauty of this.

40:41.148 --> 40:43.942
May this thought
give you strength.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.978
"Master...

41:20.395 --> 41:23.482
Your wife has given birth to a monster."

41:24.441 --> 41:25.609
A monster?

41:26.651 --> 41:28.612
"He has a carp's lips

41:28.862 --> 41:30.447
and a dog's paws.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.908
One can't imagine

41:33.074 --> 41:36.578
such a creature.
The whole castle is horrified."

41:46.087 --> 41:46.755
No!

41:48.423 --> 41:49.591
Gardener...

41:50.342 --> 41:51.801
Gardener!

41:52.761 --> 41:54.387
- My hands...
- He's fine.

41:54.554 --> 41:56.765
- I can't cope.
- He's fine.

41:56.848 --> 42:00.393
Do not worry.
He won't remain a baby forever.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.272
You'll see him grow alongside you.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.440
But my milk...

42:06.024 --> 42:08.443
Your milk will run out.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.278
Someone else's milk

42:10.445 --> 42:12.364
will be just as good for him.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.199
Do not worry.

43:17.804 --> 43:18.680
Princess!

43:21.516 --> 43:24.019
Princess, I see that you're suffering.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.104
The cold won't help.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.356
If you like,

43:28.523 --> 43:30.609
this will soothe your pain.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.844
"Loyal gardener...

43:58.386 --> 44:02.015
I mixed my blood with a sorcerer's.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.892
I don't want

44:04.059 --> 44:06.936
this child. Tear his eyes out

44:07.062 --> 44:09.022
and throw him in the river.

44:09.439 --> 44:10.774
Kill his mother, too.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.984
I don't want to see them."

44:14.069 --> 44:16.071
"Kill his mother, too.

44:16.529 --> 44:18.573
I don't want to see them."

45:08.164 --> 45:10.250
"Loyal gardener...

45:10.458 --> 45:15.672
This son you describe as a monster
is my most precious possession.

45:16.756 --> 45:19.634
Look after him and his mother.

45:19.801 --> 45:21.970
I cherish them from afar,

45:22.053 --> 45:24.597
but my return is imminent."

46:25.742 --> 46:27.035
Princess...

46:27.452 --> 46:28.787
Take this.

46:28.912 --> 46:31.581
These seeds come from a new world.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.834
They're said to be magic.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.462
Keep them in memory of me.

46:38.797 --> 46:41.883
Gardener, I can't believe
what you say is true.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.219
My prince can't have ordered that.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.429
And yet...

46:46.971 --> 46:48.890
that is the message I received.

46:49.974 --> 46:51.059
Go.

46:51.476 --> 46:52.602
Go quickly.

47:13.164 --> 47:15.583
This route
leads straight to my prince...

47:16.584 --> 47:18.336
who wants my death

47:18.711 --> 47:20.255
and that of our child.

48:06.676 --> 48:08.469
For a reason I do not know,

48:09.220 --> 48:11.264
your father doesn't want us.

48:14.976 --> 48:17.145
This war has driven him insane.

48:20.732 --> 48:23.735
The gardener told me
to go far, far away.

48:24.903 --> 48:26.279
I am doing so.

48:27.196 --> 48:30.074
Fleeing from the one
I thought good for me.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.415
I know not
where this path leads.

48:42.128 --> 48:43.838
But don't worry, son.

48:45.506 --> 48:47.216
On that mountain...

48:48.593 --> 48:49.761
we can hide.

51:14.155 --> 51:16.199
I know not
where this route goes.

51:17.158 --> 51:19.368
But I remember
the river was my ally.

52:35.987 --> 52:37.405
Young girl...

52:37.822 --> 52:40.825
You chose to follow me.
You're now at the source.

52:42.702 --> 52:44.453
You're nearly there.

52:45.413 --> 52:46.914
On the other side

52:47.081 --> 52:50.459
of this rock
is the house of a hermit

52:50.668 --> 52:52.420
who died long ago.

52:53.296 --> 52:54.755
You'll live in peace

52:54.964 --> 52:57.216
and you'll want for nothing.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.427
Your child will grow,

52:59.677 --> 53:01.179
and so will you.

53:04.932 --> 53:05.850
Go.

56:16.248 --> 56:17.333
You see...

56:17.792 --> 56:19.668
this house has become ours.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.631
No-one will find us.

56:26.008 --> 56:27.635
I'll look after you.

56:28.677 --> 56:30.221
I'll look after myself.

56:43.401 --> 56:47.071
The Prince has come back!
The war is lost!

56:47.988 --> 56:49.407
The war is over!

56:49.657 --> 56:52.284
- The Prince!
- The war is over!

57:30.531 --> 57:31.532
Gardener...

57:32.616 --> 57:35.286
The war was lost, but I have come back.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.788
Has my wife been told?

57:38.747 --> 57:41.125
And my boy, how is he?

57:42.501 --> 57:44.003
How has he grown?

57:44.462 --> 57:46.088
I do not understand.

57:48.174 --> 57:49.508
Go get them.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.343
- I want to see them.
- No!

57:51.510 --> 57:53.512
- I want to see them!
- Rest.

57:54.388 --> 57:56.140
You have lost your mind.

57:57.433 --> 58:00.394
Sorrow has befallen this castle.

58:14.492 --> 58:16.285
Where are my wife and son?

58:16.452 --> 58:17.870
Your son is here.

58:18.287 --> 58:19.163
In this box.

58:20.498 --> 58:22.041
As you instructed me.

58:22.208 --> 58:23.542
What are you saying?

58:24.251 --> 58:26.378
How awful!
Whose eyes are these?

58:26.545 --> 58:27.963
What instructions?

58:28.130 --> 58:29.381
Master...

58:34.470 --> 58:35.721
This letter...

58:38.140 --> 58:40.100
My sight is blurred. Read it.

58:48.317 --> 58:49.568
I see clearly.

58:52.196 --> 58:54.698
But I don't recognize
the ink or the words.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.450
I didn't write this.

58:59.495 --> 59:00.788
My son...

59:02.039 --> 59:02.998
Master...

59:03.207 --> 59:06.126
I didn't carry out
the orders in the letter.

59:06.377 --> 59:11.090
Your wife and son have set out
in search of shelter.

59:11.215 --> 59:14.051
Far from you, they live and grow,

59:14.510 --> 59:15.886
fearing your return.

59:16.387 --> 59:18.264
Gardener, you did well.

59:18.639 --> 59:19.598
Thank you!

59:20.724 --> 59:21.725
Thank you.

59:25.437 --> 59:26.939
I will find them.

59:28.691 --> 59:29.608
Go.

59:30.693 --> 59:32.319
Get my horse ready.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.126
I'll catch you!

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:29.056
Coming!

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.915
<i>At my father's mill...</i>

01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:22.044

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:33.722

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.277
<i>At my father's mill...</i>

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:51.239
<i>my loss and my path...</i>

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:54.868
<i>My loss...</i>

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.206
<i>and my path...</i>

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:12.339
A beard...

01:08:13.507 --> 01:08:14.800
An axe...

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.345
That man is your father.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.515
He's come to kill us.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.125
Wait!

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.502
I don't want to hurt you. Wait!

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:53.296
Wait!

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.173
Calm down.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.301
I won't hurt you.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:00.428
I looked all over.

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.140
Even at your father's mill.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.100
God, you're beautiful!

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.602
You haven't changed.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.274
Mother!

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:15.819
Your hands!

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:30.876
The note the gardener received
was a fake sent by an evil spirit.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:32.961
I never wanted to hurt you.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:38.049
I came to love you
as I did when I left.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.385
Our child, too.

01:09:44.305 --> 01:09:45.473
Mother!

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:33.855
Clearly there's no way
I can harm you,

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.941
young girl.

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.735
I'll leave you to your occupations.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:40.487
Others await me.

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:42.906
They're less annoying than you.

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.826
Farewell...

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:50.455
since you won't go to the devil...

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:16.898
You saved me.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.947
I'm no longer the one you left.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.950
I've forgotten how you were.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.037
But you are in front of me.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.749
I want to discover who you are...

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.294
who you will be.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.173
Let's go back to the castle.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:44.509
I don't want to.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.429
And I don't want to stay here.

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:51.516
I want to go away with you...

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:53.143
to find a home.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:56.896
