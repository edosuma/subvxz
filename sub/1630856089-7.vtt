to be the first significant painting
of the Renaissance.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.960
It encourages an emotional connection
with the viewer.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.720
How do you think Giotto achieves this?

14:41.720 --> 14:44.800
Is it by painting people
as quite lifelike and realistic?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.960
[professor] Exactly.
Giotto was one of the first artists

14:47.960 --> 14:51.800
to create three-dimensional figures
in Western European art.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.480
Plan tonight?

14:54.840 --> 14:56.200
- Pint, golf?
- Yeah.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.240
- Ooh...
- Both at the same time.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.160
- Go! Go, go.
- Wish me luck.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.480
[William's friend] Absolutely.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.760
- Very down for it.
- I would love--

15:03.760 --> 15:05.480
Excuse me, Your Royal Highness...

15:05.480 --> 15:07.480
- Oh, please don't call me that.
- Sorry.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.960
Could you sign this, please?
It's for my grandma.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.160
She's a huge fan of the royal family.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.240
- Sure.
- Thank you.

15:27.000 --> 15:27.880
Thanks.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.800
At least you're a hit
with the grannies, Will.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.640

- These books on the list?
- I've got her phone number.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.760
Already?

15:48.760 --> 15:50.600
I salute you. Respect.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.960
We're on the same course,
which means I automatically get it.

15:53.960 --> 15:54.880
That's a bit lazy.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.640
We've already crowned her
the fittest girl in Sallies.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.680
Yeah, but not literally crowned,
of course.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.600
- That's, you know, your thing.
- Ha-ha.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.680
What's her name?

16:04.880 --> 16:06.520
- Kate.
- Beautiful Kate.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.560
- Puts the Kate in intoxic-Kate-ing.
- Oh, that was good.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.600
Yeah. Yeah.

- What about girls?

16:36.440 --> 16:40.080
[chuckles] Well, obviously,
there are girls.

- Hello.

Actually, I'm done with it now.

- Great.

- I think she promised it to someone else.
- Yeah.

But you're welcome to the notes I made.
And the essay I've written if it'll help.

23:52.280 --> 23:54.600
It's no masterpiece,
but I put the research in there.

Oh, so it's you
that's been keeping me up at night.

Oh, my roommate. If it's any consolation,
her noise keeps me up too.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
Yeah.

24:12.440 --> 24:16.160
I only know it's you in the room below
because they came to sweep us for bugs.

I could have just done that in Chile.

- I did, yeah.

We missed each other by a week.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.160
Really? Um...

24:31.440 --> 24:32.400
It was... [chuckles]

24:33.760 --> 24:36.560
- [sighs] It was tough, wasn't it?
- It was, yeah.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.040
Yeah, but hacking through rainforest...

- Yeah.

With my trusty machete.

[both chuckle]

24:47.520 --> 24:48.480
Yeah.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.040
I bet you excelled.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.240
You seem like the type
who excels at everything.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.600
There are people
with high expectations of me.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.680
I don't want to let them down.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.600
I'm sure I don't have to tell you
what that's like.

- Yeah.
- [girl] Hi.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.120
Oh.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.360
Hi. Hi.

25:10.320 --> 25:11.160
Hi.

25:12.600 --> 25:13.520
Sorry, Lola, Kate.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.680
We were just discussing--

25:16.680 --> 25:19.640
How Kate excels at everything she does.
I overheard.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.920
Well, Lola is an exceptional person too.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.640
In which area?
Apart from her hearing, that is.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.880
[William] Oh, drama.
She's done a bit of acting.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.640
You're speaking for me now?
"This is Lola, my ventriloquist puppet."

25:33.320 --> 25:36.080
And what is
your area of exceptionalism, Kate?

25:36.080 --> 25:39.320
We were just discussing an expedition
we both did in South America.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.000
You're speaking for her now too?

25:41.680 --> 25:44.360
[Kate] Which involved weeks
of long-distance hiking

25:44.360 --> 25:47.040
and living off those ration packs.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.360
Bathing in ice-cold buckets of water
each morning.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.040
Bracing and outdoorsy.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.680
Such fun.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.080
I'm learning that about you.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.000
We haven't been dating very long.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.400
How much you like outdoorsy.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.360
- Well, I do, actually.
- [Lola] Sneaky.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.600
After telling me you were interested in
cinema and politics.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
I, uh...

26:08.120 --> 26:11.080
Don't outdoorsy, cinema,
and politics go together?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.320
Only as oxymorons, yeah.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.200
And you also like flirting
as soon as my back is turned.

26:17.720 --> 26:19.560
- And hitting on other people.
- What?

26:19.560 --> 26:20.640
We're on the same course.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.600
- We were just talking about an essay.
- And how exceptional Kate is.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.360
- Would you mind signing this?
- Yes, as it happens, I would.

26:26.360 --> 26:27.560
We're talking.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.640
Just go away.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.640
- [Kate scoffs]
- Please.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.720
Oh, okay.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.000
Wow.

26:36.000 --> 26:36.960
What?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.480
- That was--
- Weirdly rage-aholic.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.040
[Kate] They were only being friendly.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.680
Interrupting someone when they're talking
is the opposite of friendly. It's rude.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.680
- Okay. I really should go.
- Me too.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.480
No, I don't think you understand.
I get that all the time.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.480
You have no idea what it's like
to live with that day-in, day-out.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.480
Don't we?

26:54.200 --> 26:55.200
What, being ogled?

26:55.200 --> 26:57.720
Looked at and judged constantly?

26:57.720 --> 26:59.520
Try being a girl.

26:59.520 --> 27:00.640
A fit girl.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.360
[Lola] No, try being <i>any</i> girl.

27:02.360 --> 27:05.040
Failing that, you could
at least try to be a human being,

27:05.040 --> 27:07.560
while not reducing every woman
to whether she's fit.

27:10.080 --> 27:10.920
[William] Oh f...

27:10.920 --> 27:12.800

I just don't want you to be seeing Finchie
'cause you're making a point to me.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.960
Come on.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.000
Especially since
I've heard on the grapevine that

41:13.480 --> 41:15.200
William is miserable.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.720
And wants to leave university.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.200
[soft choral music playing faintly]

41:34.920 --> 41:35.840
All right?

41:36.520 --> 41:37.400
[Harry] Hello.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.360
[can opens]

41:46.440 --> 41:47.440
[Harry] Thanks.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.080
- [Harry exhales]
- [can opens]

41:53.360 --> 41:54.920
You're not really gonna do it.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.600
[William] What?

41:57.640 --> 41:58.640
Leave uni.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.520
Haven't decided.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.400
Stop muscling in on my territory.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.440
I know my job, to be the fuck-up
in this family. Don't you start too.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.720
Go back to St. Andrews.

42:17.720 --> 42:19.840
If not for your sake,
then for mine. I need a...

42:21.840 --> 42:22.840
purpose in life.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.600
Screw up and make you look

42:26.640 --> 42:27.640
good.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.160
[laughs]

42:30.960 --> 42:32.040
[Harry chuckles]

42:37.880 --> 42:39.440
What's going on with you and Pa?

42:40.600 --> 42:43.320
He found out about the weed, didn't he?

42:44.480 --> 42:47.360
Went ballistic.
Said I could have got myself expelled.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.720
Now he wants me
to go to a treatment center

42:50.720 --> 42:52.640
to spend the day with some addicts.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.640
[William] What?

42:55.480 --> 42:57.560
"Bit of an overreaction," I said.

42:57.560 --> 43:00.800
"Remorse and responsibility," he said.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.040
Thanks. [scoffs]

43:04.920 --> 43:06.800
'Cause it'll be in all the papers.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.920
And make me look like a lost cause. Again.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.360
People will say,
"Poor boy, ever since his mother died..."

43:22.480 --> 43:24.760
But I guess
it's all working out perfectly.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.520
'Cause there's no need
for a number two in this family.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.520
Except as entertainment.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.760
I can't be normal or a success, can I?
And eclipse you in any way.

43:38.760 --> 43:40.840
That would make a mockery
of the whole show.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.240
So it's Willy Gold Star,
Harry Black Sheep.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.320
Willy Saint, Harry Sinner.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.480
Willy Solid, Harry Lost.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
[somber music plays]

43:58.240 --> 44:00.040
A fucking treatment center.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.880
[both chuckle]

44:06.600 --> 44:08.800
Can you imagine
how people would freak out if

44:09.920 --> 44:12.560
<i>you</i> were the one
who was going to a treatment center?

44:12.560 --> 44:15.080
It would be like
the temple was falling down.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.400
With me, it's just what people want.

44:21.680 --> 44:22.600
Fucking up.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.480
"Ah, that's Harry Wales' job."

44:29.840 --> 44:31.840
[footsteps departing]

44:45.720 --> 44:47.720
[water running]

44:48.400 --> 44:49.280
[spits]

44:49.840 --> 44:50.840
[water stops]

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
[tapping keys]

45:30.480 --> 45:32.480
[phone chiming]

46:00.960 --> 46:02.960
[somber music fades out]

46:07.280 --> 46:11.040
["Music Sounds Better With You"
by Stardust playing]

47:18.720 --> 47:20.480
[music fades out]
