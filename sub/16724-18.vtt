00:20.626 --> 00:22.128
(yawns)

00:22.129 --> 00:23.329
My birthday.

00:23.362 --> 00:25.231
Boy... (coughs)

00:25.231 --> 00:27.833
Ah. Oh. I can't even
say it to myself.

00:27.835 --> 00:29.367
Forty-f... (groans)

00:29.368 --> 00:30.870
Forty-f...

00:30.870 --> 00:32.905
Oh. Maybe I'll sleep
through this one.

00:32.905 --> 00:34.140
(sleepy murmuring)

00:34.173 --> 00:36.008
Mom!
Are you up yet?

00:36.042 --> 00:37.643
We may or may not have
a surprise for you.

00:37.643 --> 00:38.844
We're coming in!

00:38.878 --> 00:40.412
Put your boobs away.

00:40.414 --> 00:43.415
Excuse me, young lady,
we're looking for our mother,

00:43.417 --> 00:45.784
to serve her breakfast in bed
on her birthday.

00:45.819 --> 00:47.552
Yeah, we don't mean
to bother you.

00:47.554 --> 00:49.655
You're obviously in the
middle of a photo shoot,

00:49.655 --> 00:51.055
'cause you're a
youthful supermodel.

00:51.057 --> 00:52.692
Guys, this <i> is</i> Mom.

00:52.725 --> 00:55.060
What?!
Oh!

00:55.094 --> 00:56.695
Happy birthday, Mom!

00:56.697 --> 00:58.398
Happy toast, eggs and
orange juice, pretty mom!

00:58.399 --> 00:59.499
Thank you, kids.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.732
It's lovely.

01:00.734 --> 01:02.234
The best part of my birthday

01:02.235 --> 01:05.004
is my babies bringing me
breakfast in bed every year.

01:05.004 --> 01:06.338
Ah-ah-ah,
not so fast.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.240
There might be more this year.
Oh.

01:08.275 --> 01:11.010
Okay, "add a drop of witch hazel
to the egg whites

01:11.043 --> 01:13.579
for even tighter,
smoother skin."

01:13.614 --> 01:16.081
Don't have witch hazel,
but how about vinegar?

01:16.082 --> 01:17.417
Same thing. Maybe.

01:17.418 --> 01:18.918
Linda is gonna love this.

01:18.918 --> 01:20.186
(high-pitched voice):
"You're right, Bob.

01:20.186 --> 01:21.521
You're the best husband."

01:21.521 --> 01:22.754
Thank you, vinegar.

01:22.756 --> 01:24.090
I'm glad witch hazel's not here.

01:24.091 --> 01:25.591
Oh.

01:25.591 --> 01:27.293
Oh, the toast is a little burnt.

01:27.293 --> 01:29.262
Yep, just the way
you like it.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.097
Oh, and hard.
Burnt and hard.

01:31.097 --> 01:33.365
Every year I say, "Why does
she like it this way?"

01:33.366 --> 01:35.801
But then I say, "Hey, make
it the way she likes it."

01:35.802 --> 01:37.270
BOB: Kids, I could use
a little help in here.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.438
But we like
to watch her graze, Dad.

01:39.439 --> 01:40.740
Go on, I'm good.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.275
Maybe bring me some new toast!

01:42.308 --> 01:43.709
Stir until frothy.

01:43.710 --> 01:44.944
That's subjective.

01:44.944 --> 01:46.412
Kids, does this look frothy
to you?

01:46.447 --> 01:47.879
Mm... I've seen
frothier.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.115
What is that, egg whites?

01:49.115 --> 01:50.917
Mostly. And vinegar.

01:50.918 --> 01:52.784
Gene, would you slice up that cucumber?
On it.

01:52.786 --> 01:54.219
And, Tina, can you do this?

01:54.221 --> 01:55.787
A mayonnaise hair treatment?

01:55.789 --> 01:57.789
Mom's hair is gonna shine
like a beautiful sandwich.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.259
Why is home spa
day so delicious?

02:00.260 --> 02:02.161
Oh, Louise, and can you just
clean up this mess?

02:02.162 --> 02:03.629
What?!
You're the youngest.

02:03.629 --> 02:06.599
I'm also the worst at cleanup.
Look.

02:06.632 --> 02:09.235
Gene, after you're done with
the cucumbers, clean up. No.

02:09.235 --> 02:10.469
Tina, after you do
the hair treatment,

02:10.471 --> 02:11.737
can you clean up?
Okay.

02:13.272 --> 02:14.574
Can I come out now?

02:14.574 --> 02:15.807
BOB:
Not yet, Lin!

02:15.808 --> 02:17.075
What?

02:17.076 --> 02:18.443
How about now?

02:18.444 --> 02:19.679
Almost!

02:19.680 --> 02:21.013
Now?

02:21.014 --> 02:22.949
Not really close
at all, sorry.

02:22.949 --> 02:25.918
Oh... Well, did you happen
to get milk yesterday?

02:25.919 --> 02:27.252
Huh?

02:27.253 --> 02:28.653
No, I forgot.

02:28.655 --> 02:30.256
I was preoccupied
with something

02:30.257 --> 02:32.125
(singsongy): That I think
you're gonna like!

02:32.126 --> 02:33.425
(singsongy):
That's nice,

02:33.426 --> 02:35.728
but somebody has
to do the shopping!

02:35.763 --> 02:38.831
(singsongy):
I'll do it this afternoon!

02:38.865 --> 02:41.300
Okay, I'm getting a little
cabin fever in here.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.135
What if I go to the store
and do our shopping

02:43.137 --> 02:44.370
while you guys do
whatever you're doing

02:44.371 --> 02:45.604
that I don't know about?

02:45.639 --> 02:46.872
Stay in there!

02:46.873 --> 02:48.441
Don't make us chain you up!

02:48.442 --> 02:50.308
Actually, that could
work out perfectly.

02:50.310 --> 02:52.211
We could use the extra time.
What?

02:52.211 --> 02:53.545
I'm gonna blindfold her.

02:53.546 --> 02:55.147
Double-bag the head.

02:55.182 --> 02:57.283
Ow.
Doing good.

02:57.317 --> 02:58.550
Ow.

02:58.551 --> 02:59.819
Little to the left.

02:59.819 --> 03:01.052
Ow! Louise!

03:01.054 --> 03:02.388
I-I said to your left.

03:02.389 --> 03:04.056
Ow. Ow.
And we're here.

03:04.056 --> 03:05.858
Ugh. Why'd I have
to be blindfolded?

03:05.859 --> 03:07.259
'Cause you're a sneaky peeky.

03:07.294 --> 03:08.427
Hey, take your time, Lin.

03:08.461 --> 03:10.163
Uh, treat yourself.

03:10.163 --> 03:11.798
Go to the good store.
You mean the one that's further away?

03:11.799 --> 03:12.798
Yeah!

03:12.800 --> 03:13.800
The good store?

03:13.800 --> 03:15.200
Get the premium fudge pops!

03:15.201 --> 03:16.902
Don't you come home
without them!

03:16.903 --> 03:18.336
Yeah, for your birthday.

03:18.337 --> 03:19.938
Right, happy birthday!
See you when you get back!

03:19.973 --> 03:21.973
Bye.
TINA: Oh, and can you get more mayonnaise?

03:21.974 --> 03:23.175
We're out and
I need it today.

03:23.210 --> 03:24.743
But not for a surprise.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.012
Just, um, 'cause I need it.

03:26.013 --> 03:27.747
Okay, Tina.
Thank you.

03:27.747 --> 03:29.748
Good-bye.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.050
It was nice, Ginger.
It was nice, as always.

03:32.051 --> 03:34.052
But then they wanted me
to stay in my room forever

03:34.054 --> 03:35.320
while they set
something else up.

03:35.322 --> 03:36.788
I was going crazy in there!

03:36.824 --> 03:38.324
Meanwhile, no one
did the shopping,

03:38.324 --> 03:39.525
so that's what I'm doing.

03:39.526 --> 03:41.526
Ugh, chalk festival.

03:41.527 --> 03:43.562
What's next,
a crayon convention?

03:43.597 --> 03:45.031
A pencil parade? Right?

03:45.031 --> 03:46.566
Anyway, I know
my family means well,

03:46.599 --> 03:49.201
but I wish I could just
tell them I hate my birthday.

03:49.203 --> 03:51.437
You get to a certain age
and they're no fun.

03:51.437 --> 03:53.338
In my 20s, I had va va voom,

03:53.340 --> 03:55.074
now I just have
va va (blows raspberry).

03:55.074 --> 03:57.409
And it feels like breakfast
in bed is just practice now

03:57.411 --> 03:59.444
for when they put me
in a home, right? (chuckles)

03:59.445 --> 04:01.848
Well, anyway, thanks for
letting me vent, Ginger.

04:01.848 --> 04:03.449
Sorry for the long voice mail.

04:03.449 --> 04:04.717
Call me when you can.

04:04.717 --> 04:05.951
Love you, kid. Bye.

04:07.287 --> 04:08.587
(sighs)

04:08.622 --> 04:10.355
This is taking forever.

04:10.356 --> 04:12.258
I can help whoever's next
on check stand three!

04:12.259 --> 04:13.492
Oh, great.

04:13.526 --> 04:15.895
Thank you.
Uh, hey, excuse me!

04:15.929 --> 04:17.629
He said whoever's next.
That's me.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.865
I'm next in line.

04:18.865 --> 04:20.098
You were behind me, 'member?

04:20.100 --> 04:21.733
You were just over there...
Oh, it's okay.

04:21.735 --> 04:22.968
I only have a few things.

04:22.970 --> 04:25.204
This and that
and this other thing.

04:25.204 --> 04:27.406
A few things?
She's got a cart full of juice.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.242
Deirdre! How's it going?
Hi!

04:30.244 --> 04:31.576
Oh, my God,
they know each other.

04:31.612 --> 04:33.211
Is all of this for
"Chalk of the Town"?

04:33.213 --> 04:35.213
Yeah, we're hoping for
a bigger turnout this year.

04:35.249 --> 04:37.783
Ugh, that stupid
chalk festival.

04:37.817 --> 04:39.752
I'm not sure about
these cups though.

04:39.752 --> 04:41.220
Mm, good instinct.

04:41.221 --> 04:43.656
Since you brought it up,
these are not the good cups.

04:43.656 --> 04:44.923
What?

04:44.925 --> 04:46.692
Tell me everything.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.795
They leak. I don't know
why I even sell them.

04:48.795 --> 04:50.295
We have better cups
for the same price.

04:50.297 --> 04:51.930
The ones on the bottom shelf,
ironically.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.865
Well, clearly I got to have
those cups.

04:53.901 --> 04:55.100
Go get them.
I'll wait for you.

04:55.101 --> 04:56.636
(chuckles):
Oh, thanks.

04:56.637 --> 04:58.937
I'm here till 3:00, I don't care.
Unbelievable.

04:58.939 --> 05:00.906
Oh, and you might want to
grab some more ice, too.

05:00.908 --> 05:02.408
It's a hot one.
DEIRDRE: Good idea!

05:02.408 --> 05:04.209
She'll just be a second.
You don't mind, right?

05:04.244 --> 05:05.644
(growls)
Great, thanks.

05:05.646 --> 05:07.612
So, you're not done yet.

05:07.648 --> 05:09.081
Let's take a look
at this receipt,

05:09.081 --> 05:10.283
see how much you saved today.

05:10.317 --> 05:11.384
Oh, gosh, yes.

05:11.418 --> 05:12.584
Oh, my God, please!

05:12.586 --> 05:13.819
Just end this!

05:13.821 --> 05:15.788
We're not getting
any younger over here!

05:15.788 --> 05:17.689
Well, don't blame us for that.
(gasps)

05:17.690 --> 05:19.324
(both laughing)

05:19.326 --> 05:21.360
Anyway, thanks again
for the tip on the cups.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.596
Hey, no problem. Let me
know how they work out.

05:23.596 --> 05:25.130
Nice, uh, chalking with you.

05:25.132 --> 05:26.699
(laughs):
Oh-ho-ho, you!

05:26.699 --> 05:27.966
Finally!

05:27.968 --> 05:29.367
You sure you guys are done?

05:29.369 --> 05:31.971
Hold on. I have to put these old cups back.
(groans)

05:31.971 --> 05:33.439
Stupid birthday.

05:33.439 --> 05:35.106
I hate cups.

05:35.108 --> 05:36.509
Nuts!

05:36.543 --> 05:38.577
Old flower petals
from Mort's? Check.

05:38.612 --> 05:40.045
That's great, Tina.
We'll spread them

05:40.047 --> 05:42.380
from the front door into
the bathroom to the tub.

05:43.449 --> 05:44.649
Huh.

05:44.685 --> 05:46.485
Hmm.
Huh. Yeah.

05:46.519 --> 05:48.321
BOB:
That's, like, six... six petals.

05:48.355 --> 05:50.156
Yeah, not a lot of
funerals this month.

05:50.156 --> 05:51.858
Mort said to check back
around the holidays.

05:51.858 --> 05:54.627
Maybe just one in the hallway,
one in the doorway,

05:54.627 --> 05:56.495
and then one at the tub?
Yeah.

05:56.497 --> 05:58.230
Well, we could get some branches.
Yeah, I don't...

05:58.231 --> 05:59.865
I'm not sure that will
have the same impact.

05:59.867 --> 06:00.932
Hmm.

06:00.968 --> 06:02.834
Okay, well, just
float those in the tub.

06:02.836 --> 06:04.237
That'll still be nice.

06:04.237 --> 06:06.572
And here's my New Age
relaxation CD.

06:06.572 --> 06:08.975
A lady having a garage sale
forced me to take it.

06:08.975 --> 06:11.276
(whale song playing)
That's pretty relaxing, I guess.

06:11.310 --> 06:13.312
Is... is
that whales?

06:13.312 --> 06:15.148
I think it's...
the saddest whale.

06:15.149 --> 06:16.682
This isn't that
bad, you guys.

06:16.682 --> 06:18.417
I think we may have actually
pulled this together.

06:18.418 --> 06:21.353
I mean, I know your mom, and
she's really gonna like this.

06:21.355 --> 06:23.322
This could end up being
a pretty decent birthday.

06:23.322 --> 06:24.557
Pretty decent birthday?

06:24.557 --> 06:26.091
More like best birthday!

06:26.093 --> 06:27.360
Best birthday?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.661
Best day of her life!

06:28.694 --> 06:30.495
(grunts)
Oh, mm...

06:30.497 --> 06:32.999
Oh, come on!

06:33.033 --> 06:35.168
(grunting)

06:35.201 --> 06:37.370
Aw, gum?

06:37.403 --> 06:39.838
Ew! (groans)

06:39.872 --> 06:41.439
(grunting)

06:46.079 --> 06:47.646
(grunts)

06:47.680 --> 06:49.981
Damn it! Wha... oh!

06:50.016 --> 06:52.185
No, no, no, no, no, no!

06:52.185 --> 06:53.718
I hate my birthday!

06:58.814 --> 07:00.649
Hi. Me again.
(chuckles)

07:00.649 --> 07:03.250
Uh, I locked my keys in
my car and I was wondering

07:03.252 --> 07:05.286
if I could use your phone
to call my husband.

07:05.288 --> 07:06.555
Mm, I'm sorry.

07:06.555 --> 07:08.055
Our phone is for employees only.

07:08.057 --> 07:09.423
It's an emergency!

07:09.425 --> 07:10.492
Locking your keys in your car

07:10.492 --> 07:11.725
is not an emergency.
What?

07:11.761 --> 07:13.060
You can't check into
a hospital with

07:13.062 --> 07:14.762
a bad case of "you locked
your keys in your car."

07:14.797 --> 07:16.130
You know what? Fine.

07:16.132 --> 07:17.432
I'll ask to borrow
someone's cell phone.

07:17.466 --> 07:19.100
No harassing our customers.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.100
Did you know
your pants are ripped?

07:20.136 --> 07:22.269
Yes!

07:27.076 --> 07:29.244
Uh, excuse me, sir,
can I borrow your cell phone?

07:29.245 --> 07:31.779
I locked my keys in my car,
and I got to call my husband.

07:31.781 --> 07:33.915
Uh, I don't, uh,
have a cell phone.

07:33.915 --> 07:35.449
You don't?
(ringtone playing)

07:35.483 --> 07:36.750
What's that right there?
What's that?

07:36.752 --> 07:38.420
(stuttering):
I don't know. I got to go.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.322
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
come back!

07:40.322 --> 07:41.322
I'm a good person!

07:41.324 --> 07:43.091
(ringing)

07:43.091 --> 07:45.192
Hmm. Your mom's not
picking up her phone.

07:45.194 --> 07:46.661
Um, let me try Aunt Gayle.

07:47.697 --> 07:48.997
Hi, Gayle, it's Bob.

07:48.997 --> 07:50.999
Uh, have you heard
from Linda today?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Yes, I know
it's her birthday, Gayle.

07:53.002 --> 07:54.536
I just don't know
where she is.

07:54.536 --> 07:56.103
(Gayle shrieking)

07:56.105 --> 07:58.305
Yeah... calm down, Gayle.
I-I'm sure she's fine.

07:58.307 --> 07:59.307
Gayle, pull yourself...

07:59.307 --> 08:01.209
Gayle. Gayle! Gayle!

08:01.209 --> 08:02.978
Oh, my God, there she is.

08:02.978 --> 08:04.379
Hi, Linda.

08:04.379 --> 08:05.547
Uh, Gayle,
she just walked in.

08:05.548 --> 08:06.781
She's fine, she looks great.

08:06.781 --> 08:08.617
Call you back later. Bye.

08:08.617 --> 08:10.117
You know Mom's not
really here, right?

08:10.119 --> 08:11.286
Yes, Tina.

08:11.286 --> 08:13.120
Because you said she was...
you saw her.

08:13.122 --> 08:14.689
I know, but I was...
Forget it.

08:14.723 --> 08:16.324
Were you lying?
All right. Yes.

08:16.324 --> 08:19.394
Listen, your mom probably just
ran out of gas or something.

08:19.394 --> 08:22.630
I'll call Teddy and see if he
can drive us out to the store.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.533
Wow. Going to the store with
Teddy?

08:24.533 --> 08:26.033
Happy birthday to us.

08:28.571 --> 08:30.404
Hi.
Hi.

08:30.406 --> 08:33.607
I know I look a little crazy,
but I'm having a rough day.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.009
Uh-huh.
It's my birthday...

08:35.043 --> 08:36.845
Happy birthday!
...and I locked my keys

08:36.846 --> 08:39.313
and my cell phone
in my car at the grocery store.

08:39.315 --> 08:40.981
Oh! The worst.
Yeah.

08:40.982 --> 08:42.484
And I'm just trying to get home.

08:42.485 --> 08:43.985
Does this bus go to the wharf?

08:43.985 --> 08:45.019
You're in luck, yes!

08:45.020 --> 08:46.354
Oh! Please take me.

08:46.355 --> 08:47.989
I swear I will pay you the fare

08:47.990 --> 08:49.549
once I get it from my apartment.
Please.

08:49.558 --> 08:51.025
Okay. Come on up.

08:51.027 --> 08:52.394
Oh! Oh, thank God.

08:52.394 --> 08:53.727
Thank you! Ha.

08:53.763 --> 08:55.864
Finally,
something's going right.

08:55.865 --> 08:57.432
(chuckles)
You won't regret this.

08:59.769 --> 09:01.702
<i>Wait, wait, wait,
where you going?</i>

09:01.703 --> 09:03.104
The wharf is the other way!

09:03.105 --> 09:04.572
This is the express
to Wildwood Wharf.

09:04.573 --> 09:05.907
What wharf did you think?

09:05.908 --> 09:08.576
Wonder Wharf! The one I was
pointing at! (stammers)

09:08.577 --> 09:10.412
I just thought you
were a bad pointer.

09:10.413 --> 09:12.047
(sighs) Pull over
so I can get off.

09:12.081 --> 09:14.048
I can't pull over;
We're on the highway.

09:14.049 --> 09:16.217
You'll have to wait until
we get to our next stop.

09:16.219 --> 09:17.519
Oh, my God.

09:17.519 --> 09:19.587
Uh, well,
I guess I'll just get on

09:19.588 --> 09:21.389
the next bus going
the other way, right?

09:21.423 --> 09:23.591
That'd be me on my way back.
Oh!

09:23.592 --> 09:25.259
Shouldn't be more
than an hour and a half.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.561
Might as well just stay on.

09:26.562 --> 09:28.062
Hey, we can play
the alphabet game!

09:28.063 --> 09:29.397
An hour and a half?

09:29.398 --> 09:31.099
Oh. I'll just walk back.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.802
Fine, we'll play till the next stop.
(groans)

09:33.802 --> 09:35.604
There's an "A" on that sign.
(groans)

09:35.605 --> 09:37.538
I'm winning. There's a "B."
(groans)

09:37.539 --> 09:38.773
You're falling behind!
I got two!

09:38.774 --> 09:40.207
(driver laughs, Linda groans)

09:40.209 --> 09:41.243
BUS DRIVER:
<i>It's gonna be fun.</i>

09:41.277 --> 09:43.711
Ugh, those poor fudge pops.

09:43.712 --> 09:45.046
They don't stand a chance.

09:45.047 --> 09:47.448
They'll refreeze though,
right? Right?!

09:47.450 --> 09:49.451
Sure they will, but
they'll be in weird shapes.

09:49.451 --> 09:51.586
Ugh, super weird.
Yeah.

09:51.586 --> 09:52.921
Where are you, Mom?!

09:52.922 --> 09:55.423
Okay, she's not in the store,
but she definitely was.

09:55.423 --> 09:57.325
The checker did not like her.

09:57.326 --> 09:59.326
That was clear.
How could you tell?

09:59.327 --> 10:00.562
It was clear.
What do you mean?

10:00.562 --> 10:02.264
He said so. He hated her.

10:02.298 --> 10:03.597
He said he hate...
"I hated..."

10:03.633 --> 10:04.899
"...your wife."
Huh.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.001
But he did say he thinks
she took off walking.

10:07.003 --> 10:08.669
And we didn't see her
on the drive here,

10:08.671 --> 10:10.105
so she must have walked
in a different way?

10:10.139 --> 10:11.472
We'll never find her!

10:11.474 --> 10:13.408
There are dozens
of ways to walk home!

10:13.408 --> 10:14.643
And dozens of women walking!

10:14.644 --> 10:16.610
How will we know
which one is her?

10:16.611 --> 10:18.279
I'm already forgetting
what she looks like.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.481
She's a woman.
I think she's... tall.

10:20.515 --> 10:21.783
Does she have glasses?

10:21.783 --> 10:23.018
I can't remember.

10:23.019 --> 10:24.286
Yes! Yes, she does.

10:24.287 --> 10:25.586
All right, let's focus, okay?

10:25.587 --> 10:27.489
She has a hook for
a hand! I'm sure of it!

10:27.490 --> 10:28.523
Gene, no.

10:30.793 --> 10:32.494
Okay, so if I'm gonna walk it,

10:32.528 --> 10:34.528
I could cut through that way?

10:34.529 --> 10:36.630
You're pointing at me.
Where did you learn to point?

10:36.631 --> 10:38.500
No, I'm pointing through you.

10:38.533 --> 10:40.302
But it's at me.
The other side of the...

10:40.302 --> 10:41.503
Oh, behind me?

10:41.504 --> 10:43.038
Well, that makes
a lot more sense.

10:43.038 --> 10:44.338
Yeah, no, that's where
you want to walk.

10:44.373 --> 10:45.673
Okay, thanks, Andrew.

10:45.707 --> 10:46.674
Bye, Linda.

10:46.676 --> 10:48.509
Bye.
Okay, bye, Linda.

10:48.510 --> 10:50.544
Happy birthday.
Beep-beep.

10:50.546 --> 10:51.980
That's me; The horn
doesn't work.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.148
Bye.

10:55.717 --> 10:57.985
Well, this is the only other
street your mom could've taken.

10:57.986 --> 10:59.453
Where is she?
We got to find her.

10:59.455 --> 11:00.788
Every minute
we're not with her,

11:00.789 --> 11:02.350
she's having a worse
and worse birthday.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.826
She must have stopped somewhere,
but where would she go?

11:04.860 --> 11:06.494
Is Chaka Khan in town?

11:06.495 --> 11:08.296
Nope, she doesn't come
through till December.

11:08.297 --> 11:09.663
Mom probably got hungry.

11:09.664 --> 11:11.131
She needs to eat
every 15 minutes

11:11.133 --> 11:12.701
or she becomes a monster.

11:12.701 --> 11:14.134
But she doesn't have
any money.

11:14.135 --> 11:15.503
She locked her purse
in the car.

11:15.504 --> 11:17.038
Oh, Devendorf's Bakery.

11:17.038 --> 11:18.907
They're really generous
with their samples.

11:18.908 --> 11:20.341
Mom and I go there a lot.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.177
You do?
Well, it's actually been a while.

11:22.177 --> 11:24.144
We're both worried
about bathing suit season.

11:24.145 --> 11:25.980
I guess it's worth a try.

11:25.981 --> 11:27.148
To Devendorf's Bakery!

11:27.149 --> 11:29.216
To free samples!

11:29.251 --> 11:31.385
(bird cawing)

11:32.355 --> 11:34.855
Ugh, mud.

11:34.856 --> 11:36.057
(groans)

11:36.057 --> 11:37.158
Okay, Linda.

11:37.158 --> 11:38.726
Try to look on the bright side.

11:38.727 --> 11:41.096
How often do you get to walk
through a field?

11:41.096 --> 11:42.530
It's kind of neat. Look around.

11:42.532 --> 11:44.198
It's a nice day.

11:44.232 --> 11:45.866
Oh, here's a pretty flower. Oh!

11:45.902 --> 11:47.201
Oh, God, uh-oh, it's skunk.

11:47.235 --> 11:48.769
Oh, he's sleeping.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.773
Just gonna tiptoe away
and not bother you.

11:51.774 --> 11:53.008
Oh, God!

11:53.009 --> 11:54.543
Oh, my face!

11:58.009 --> 11:59.209
(muttering)

11:59.210 --> 12:00.876
(groaning)

12:00.912 --> 12:03.879
Oh, God, that stupid skunk!

12:03.880 --> 12:05.014
Nocturnal idiot!

12:05.048 --> 12:07.350
Whoa!
(cracking)

12:07.350 --> 12:08.350
Oh, for the love of Pete!

12:08.385 --> 12:09.952
(chuckles)

12:09.953 --> 12:11.754
I can still see out of one side.

12:11.755 --> 12:13.590
Sort of.
What's that black fuzzy thing?

12:13.624 --> 12:15.057
(screams)

12:15.058 --> 12:17.193
Oh, you little skunk!

12:17.227 --> 12:19.696
BOB: So this is where you go
with your mom, huh?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.230
Yeah, now let me do
the talking.

12:21.231 --> 12:22.532
You just look cute.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.033
Hey, you, long time no see.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.235
How's the pumpernickel today?

12:25.235 --> 12:26.870
Dry? Better try a sample.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.538
Hello, uh, I'm looking
for my wife.

12:28.538 --> 12:30.407
She's got black hair
and red glasses.

12:30.408 --> 12:32.375
And amazing wrists,
but huge hands.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.376
Teddy.
What? I'm just trying to be specific.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.946
You mean her?

12:35.980 --> 12:38.148
Yes. Wait, why do you have
a photo of...

12:38.149 --> 12:40.216
Wait, what does that say
on the picture?

12:40.217 --> 12:41.418
It says "Do not feed."

12:41.451 --> 12:43.419
What?
Do not feed.

12:43.453 --> 12:46.489
Your wife was abusing
our free sample policy.

12:46.490 --> 12:48.625
She hasn't been in here
since we posted the photo.

12:48.658 --> 12:50.393
She's been coming here
without me?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.561
What did that guy do?

12:51.596 --> 12:52.796
He wants his crusts cut off.

12:52.797 --> 12:54.129
What did she do?

12:54.130 --> 12:55.599
She touches everything.
Everything.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.633
What did he do?

12:56.634 --> 12:57.834
He's really racist.

12:57.835 --> 12:59.134
What did that baby do?

12:59.135 --> 13:00.803
He's just a jerk.
Okay, fine.

13:00.837 --> 13:02.404
Thank you. Uh, we're leaving.

13:02.405 --> 13:03.807
Kids, let's go.

13:03.807 --> 13:05.509
You know, maybe don't
give out free samples

13:05.509 --> 13:07.777
and then get mad at people
when they eat them.

13:07.778 --> 13:10.447
Well, you know, unfortunately,
we can't bake enough in a day

13:10.447 --> 13:12.182
to fill your wife's giant hands.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.083
There's only so much
pumpernickel in the world.

13:14.118 --> 13:15.818
What did you say?

13:15.852 --> 13:17.854
Oh-ho, you poor dumb baker.

13:17.855 --> 13:18.955
Here comes the thunder.

13:18.990 --> 13:20.624
Guess what?
No one talks about...

13:20.625 --> 13:21.624
Hey.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.326
My wife's giant hands...

13:24.361 --> 13:26.495
- Easy.
- On her birthday!

13:26.496 --> 13:28.999
Except for Teddy, because...

13:29.033 --> 13:31.534
All right... he also...

13:31.536 --> 13:34.270
complimented...
her wrists!

13:34.272 --> 13:36.438
And this pumpernickel <i> is</i> dry!

13:36.440 --> 13:38.040
And a little dirty.

13:42.408 --> 13:44.080
Please give me a ride!

13:44.115 --> 13:45.682
- I locked my keys in my car...
- Oh, God, go, go!

13:45.682 --> 13:47.562
And I got on the wrong bus
and it's my birthday!

13:53.124 --> 13:55.024
All right, let's all think.

13:55.025 --> 13:57.092
Where else could your mom
have possibly gone

13:57.094 --> 13:58.662
between the grocery store
and home?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.197
Okay, okay, I'm Mom.

14:00.197 --> 14:01.697
I'm walking around, I'm singing.

14:01.698 --> 14:03.799
(gasps) She stopped to poop!

14:03.801 --> 14:05.469
Of course!
Why didn't I think of that?

14:05.470 --> 14:06.836
We should check the bathroom
in the lobby

14:06.837 --> 14:08.238
of the Royal Oyster Hotel.

14:08.239 --> 14:09.972
Why that one?
It's Mom's favorite.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.640
What?
So that's what Mom means

14:11.642 --> 14:13.643
when she says she's going
to shuck an oyster.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.845
Oh, my God.

14:14.846 --> 14:16.212
I want to see this bathroom.

14:16.213 --> 14:17.547
I could go.
(sighs)

14:17.548 --> 14:19.381
Let's go to
the Royal Oyster Hotel.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.150
GENE: <i>Should we call ahead
to let them know</i>

14:21.152 --> 14:22.418
<i>we'll all be pooping?</i>

14:25.490 --> 14:27.057
(horse whinnies)

14:28.359 --> 14:30.860
Oh, like you guys
smell so good.

14:38.402 --> 14:40.736
Uh, turns out
it was just number one.

14:40.738 --> 14:41.871
Thank you, Teddy.

14:41.905 --> 14:43.706
Not for me.
I hit a grand slam.

14:43.707 --> 14:45.040
Really good job, Gene.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.509
Thank you.
No Mom.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.878
But they did get
a new potpourri.

14:47.879 --> 14:49.178
Mom's gonna love it.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.114
Excuse me, are you
guests of the hotel?

14:51.115 --> 14:53.884
No, uh, we're, uh, we're...
we're just looking for my wife.

14:53.884 --> 14:57.086
She sometimes comes here to...
use the... restroom.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.388
Oh, Linda?

14:58.389 --> 14:59.688
You must be Bob!

14:59.690 --> 15:01.557
Yes. Wait, y-you know her?

15:01.591 --> 15:03.592
Well, as much
as you can know a woman

15:03.594 --> 15:05.695
who comes to your hotel
once or twice a week to poop.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.697
Hey, isn't it
her birthday today?

15:07.697 --> 15:08.865
Uh, yes.

15:08.865 --> 15:11.100
Hey, Tim.
Have you seen Linda today?

15:11.101 --> 15:12.936
Oh, please, it's barely noon.

15:12.937 --> 15:16.206
♪ She does her B.M.
in the p.m. ♪

15:16.240 --> 15:17.441
Hi, Tim.

15:17.442 --> 15:18.808
♪ Hey, Tina ♪

15:18.809 --> 15:20.443
♪ How you doing, girl? ♪

15:20.445 --> 15:24.246
Huh, well, she's not here,
so we better go.

15:24.282 --> 15:26.249
What? No, stay a little.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.717
We finally get to meet you
after all these years.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.453
Years?
Where does the time go?

15:30.455 --> 15:32.154
We-we really
got to find my wife.

15:32.155 --> 15:33.389
Nice meeting you though.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.724
Bye.
Bye.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.058
Say hi to Linda for me.

15:36.059 --> 15:37.427
Tell her we got new potpourri.

15:37.427 --> 15:38.727
She was absolutely right.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.929
Uh, will do.

15:39.963 --> 15:43.332
(panting):
Just four more blocks.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.068
Oh, God, this thing?

15:46.104 --> 15:47.636
Welcome to Chalk of the Town.

15:47.638 --> 15:48.904
Oh, God, it's you.

15:48.905 --> 15:50.273
Oh, you and your dumb cups.

15:50.274 --> 15:51.307
What happened?

15:51.308 --> 15:52.743
(sniffs)
Oh, you smell.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.044
It's been a rough morning,
Deirdre.

15:55.078 --> 15:56.913
What is that,
some sort of street diaper?

15:56.913 --> 15:57.947
You're a street diaper.

15:57.981 --> 16:00.116
No, you're the street diaper.
No, you!

16:00.150 --> 16:02.018
Okay, you're the one actually
wearing a street diaper,

16:02.019 --> 16:03.986
so if anyone is a
street diaper, it's you.

16:03.988 --> 16:06.322
Step aside, street diaper.
I'm going through.

16:06.323 --> 16:08.325
Oh, not without a
ticket, I'm afraid.

16:08.326 --> 16:09.926
Well, I'm afraid
it's a public street,

16:09.927 --> 16:11.461
so get out of my way.

16:11.461 --> 16:12.928
You should have been nicer
at the grocery store

16:12.929 --> 16:14.130
and maybe I would.

16:14.131 --> 16:15.631
Uh-oh! Your cups are spilling!

16:15.666 --> 16:17.267
What are you do... Oh, my God.

16:17.301 --> 16:19.269
I guess these weren't
the good ones after all.

16:19.302 --> 16:20.504
Oh, don't!

16:20.538 --> 16:22.004
Stop! No!

16:22.005 --> 16:24.441
My chalksterpiece!

16:24.442 --> 16:26.442
Do not move.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.945
Just carefully step off.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.846
What is this?

16:30.847 --> 16:32.448
It's the story of America,

16:32.450 --> 16:34.551
and you're scuffing it up,
you hag!

16:34.552 --> 16:36.452
(gasps)
Hag?!

16:36.453 --> 16:38.654
Yep.
You know what I think?

16:38.688 --> 16:40.023
I think I'm gonna do
a little twist.

16:40.057 --> 16:41.857
No. No.
A little twist and shout.

16:41.859 --> 16:44.494
No! Don't you do it.
A twist a twisty shout.

16:44.528 --> 16:45.729
How-how about the Charleston?

16:45.730 --> 16:48.631
(grunting)
(humming)

16:48.633 --> 16:50.801
(screams)

16:50.802 --> 16:54.037
I'm gonna Charleston
on your face!

16:54.038 --> 16:55.639
(screams)

16:58.981 --> 17:00.615
(screaming)

17:00.649 --> 17:01.850
Come back here!
I'm gonna get you!

17:01.884 --> 17:03.751
Help!

17:03.787 --> 17:05.118
She's crazy!
Get back here!

17:05.121 --> 17:07.056
She's destroying the art!

17:07.089 --> 17:09.892
No, I'm not! You're the one
stepping all over everything!

17:09.925 --> 17:11.594
Sorry, sorry!

17:11.627 --> 17:14.153
Ooh, good manhole!

17:14.163 --> 17:15.631
Ooh, space!

17:15.632 --> 17:16.932
Hi, aliens!
Whoa!

17:17.968 --> 17:20.669
Whoa! Whoa!

17:28.912 --> 17:30.346
(laughs, whoops)

17:31.080 --> 17:32.882
Damn it!

17:32.915 --> 17:35.851
Wow. People are
very divided on your mom.

17:35.852 --> 17:36.986
Where is she?

17:36.987 --> 17:38.153
Does this town have cults?

17:38.153 --> 17:39.755
Maybe she joined
one of those.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.957
I might know a place
where she could be.

17:41.958 --> 17:43.265
Where?
She's probably not there.

17:43.292 --> 17:44.593
I shouldn't have said anything.

17:44.594 --> 17:46.095
Let's definitely not go.

17:46.128 --> 17:47.462
(barking)

17:47.463 --> 17:49.464
Well, she's not here.
Let's call it.

17:49.465 --> 17:51.634
Wait, Louise,
you and your mom come here?

17:51.667 --> 17:53.025
Used to come.

17:53.036 --> 17:54.603
To pet the puppies?

17:54.637 --> 17:56.538
No. (scoffs) I guess.

17:56.539 --> 17:58.641
I don't know; I've never even
come inside the store.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.442
I'm always outside
just pitching pennies,

18:00.442 --> 18:02.144
breaking bottles,
you know, being a hoodlum.

18:02.144 --> 18:03.444
Hey, Louise,
I thought that was you.

18:03.445 --> 18:04.779
Oh, hi, Robert.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.281
Want me to get out
Colonel Fluffles again?

18:06.282 --> 18:07.449
He missed you.

18:07.483 --> 18:09.117
Hi, Louise, how you doing?

18:09.152 --> 18:10.853
Oh, God, don't
make eye contact.

18:10.854 --> 18:12.020
He's reeling me in.

18:12.021 --> 18:14.190
(giggles)
Colonel Fluffles!

18:14.191 --> 18:15.824
You're so...

18:15.858 --> 18:18.527
♪ Someone comes
to the pet store with Mom. ♪

18:18.528 --> 18:20.796
I'm beginning to think my
secret bathroom trips with Mom

18:20.797 --> 18:22.364
aren't as fun
as what you guys do.

18:22.398 --> 18:23.531
Uh, he's getting old.

18:23.532 --> 18:25.000
I'm just a puppy.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.501
Well, he's got cloudy
eyes this time.

18:26.502 --> 18:27.970
Yeah, I know,
his eyes are a little...

18:27.971 --> 18:29.837
But I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

18:29.838 --> 18:31.073
I'm a scrapper.

18:31.074 --> 18:33.008
Oh, he looks lumpier
than last time.

18:33.009 --> 18:35.192
I'm a little bit lumpy,
but that's just more to love.

18:35.211 --> 18:36.644
Yes, that is.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.180
Want to say hi
to Uncle Feathers?

18:38.181 --> 18:39.381
All right!

18:39.415 --> 18:40.715
Did it just say "all right"?

18:40.717 --> 18:42.084
All right!

18:42.085 --> 18:43.852
Wow. Your mom leads a rich,

18:43.853 --> 18:46.721
kind of odd life
that I did not know about.

18:46.756 --> 18:48.656
Bobby, does this parrot
make me look cool?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.159
Oh, crap. I just realized,

18:50.160 --> 18:51.559
if Linda gets home,
she can't get in.

18:51.560 --> 18:52.894
She doesn't have her keys.

18:52.895 --> 18:54.329
One of us
should have stayed behind.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.998
Not it.
Gene, it's too late.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.067
N-Never mind. Let's go.

18:58.101 --> 18:59.234
Ha!

18:59.236 --> 19:00.769
Ha! Ha-ha!

19:00.769 --> 19:02.570
I did it!
I actually made it home.

19:02.605 --> 19:04.105
Bob! Kids!

19:04.106 --> 19:05.240
Let me in!

19:05.241 --> 19:06.241
Mommy's home!

19:06.276 --> 19:07.675
It's the birthday girl!

19:07.676 --> 19:08.810
(groans)

19:08.845 --> 19:10.078
Where are they?

19:10.079 --> 19:11.228
(grunting)

19:11.248 --> 19:12.438
Aah!

19:17.019 --> 19:18.186
Ooh.

19:18.188 --> 19:19.188
Aah!

19:20.423 --> 19:22.124
Not gonna let this birthday win.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.125
(grunting continues)

19:28.097 --> 19:30.031
Yes! I win!

19:31.201 --> 19:33.335
Son of a bitch.

19:33.369 --> 19:35.136
Ha!

19:36.373 --> 19:38.339
Ha-ha!

19:38.375 --> 19:41.277
Whoa!
(screaming)

19:41.278 --> 19:42.411
KIDS: Mom?
Lin?

19:42.444 --> 19:44.947
(softly):
Happy Spa Day.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.481
That's me.

19:48.951 --> 19:51.119
You sure it was
only one skunk, Mom?

19:51.121 --> 19:53.489
No, it was two,
or it was the same guy twice.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.423
Mom, is it cool if
I dip my grilled cheese

19:55.424 --> 19:57.226
in your tomato bath?
Yeah, go ahead.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.394
Yeah!
So, wait, what color were the horses again?

19:59.429 --> 20:01.730
Just plain brown, I guess.
(whispers): Yes.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.432
Lin, I got to tell you,

20:03.432 --> 20:05.166
I learned some new things
about you today.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.468
Stuff I didn't know.

20:06.469 --> 20:08.237
Stuff I respect, kind of,

20:08.238 --> 20:10.638
and I'm glad to say,
after all these years,

20:10.640 --> 20:12.740
I'm still finding
little surprises.

20:12.741 --> 20:15.678
Also, I wrote all of that
in your birthday card.

20:15.679 --> 20:16.845
See?
Oh, yeah.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.012
Aw.

20:18.013 --> 20:19.480
Yep, I did that.

20:19.481 --> 20:21.983
But sorry your birthday
was horrible, Lin.

20:21.984 --> 20:23.451
Hey, don't be sorry.

20:23.452 --> 20:25.621
This was the best birthday ever.
What?

20:25.654 --> 20:27.323
Yeah. I kicked this day's butt.

20:27.324 --> 20:28.590
I still got it.

20:28.592 --> 20:30.432
I think I might
even be getting better.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.826
I want this
to be the new tradition.

20:31.827 --> 20:33.194
Every year on my birthday,

20:33.195 --> 20:35.846
you blindfold me
and you drop me off somewhere

20:35.847 --> 20:37.332
with no cell phone
and no money,

20:37.333 --> 20:39.010
and I have to make my way home.
Deal!

20:39.011 --> 20:42.269
Now let's Bloody Mary up
this tub! It's Mommy's birthday!

20:42.269 --> 20:44.612
Gene, grab the vodka!
(whoops) All right. On it!
