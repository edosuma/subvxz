07:38.758 --> 07:41.927
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

07:42.011 --> 07:45.681
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.851
Are you aware of my existence?

07:49.853 --> 07:50.853
Yes.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.020
This is good.

07:52.605 --> 07:56.692
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

07:59.028 --> 08:00.070
Yes.

08:00.738 --> 08:02.739
Please tell me what you've heard.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.033
I've heard

08:05.577 --> 08:09.872
that the F端hrer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

08:09.956 --> 08:12.875
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

08:14.335 --> 08:17.212
The F端hrer couldn't have
said it better himself.

08:19.174 --> 08:22.801
But the meaning of your visit,

08:23.261 --> 08:27.473
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.394
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

08:32.479 --> 08:34.145
and found nothing.

08:35.899 --> 08:37.566
I'm aware of that.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.568
I've read the reports of this area.

08:42.572 --> 08:45.782
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

08:45.867 --> 08:48.952
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

08:50.205 --> 08:54.875
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

08:55.877 --> 08:58.921
I just have a few
questions, monsieur LaPadite.

09:00.423 --> 09:02.674
If you can assist me with answers,

09:02.759 --> 09:05.886
my department can close
the file on your family.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.521
Now,

09:17.190 --> 09:21.443
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

09:22.028 --> 09:24.363
all dairy farmers like yourself.

09:26.199 --> 09:30.786
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

09:32.622 --> 09:34.289
and the Dreyfuses.

09:34.457 --> 09:35.999
Is that correct?

09:36.084 --> 09:37.084
To my knowledge,

09:37.168 --> 09:40.629
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

09:40.797 --> 09:44.633
Herr Colonel, would it
disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

09:44.717 --> 09:46.176
<font color="#E767E7">(CHUCKLES)</font> Please, monsieur LaPadite,

09:46.261 --> 09:49.263
this is your house, make
yourself comfortable.

09:49.597 --> 09:52.558
Now, according to these papers,

09:53.476 --> 09:56.895
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

09:56.980 --> 09:59.815
except the Dreyfuses.

10:01.276 --> 10:04.695
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

10:04.779 --> 10:08.073
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

10:08.157 --> 10:11.076
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

10:12.287 --> 10:15.914
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

10:15.999 --> 10:16.957
Only rumors.

10:17.041 --> 10:18.333
I love rumors!

10:19.919 --> 10:21.253
Facts could be so misleading,

10:21.337 --> 10:24.506
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.383
So, monsieur LaPadite,

10:26.467 --> 10:29.720

regarding the Dreyfuses?

11:24.859 --> 11:28.445
And her brother, Bob.

11:35.703 --> 11:37.245

11:38.873 --> 11:40.207
Thirty, 31.

11:44.462 --> 11:45.712

11:46.089 --> 11:47.714
And the children,

11:49.425 --> 11:50.550

12:12.990 --> 12:15.117
And Shosanna was

12:16.786 --> 12:20.580
18 or 19. I'm not really sure.

12:31.426 --> 12:33.760

12:57.994 --> 13:01.997

13:09.088 --> 13:11.798
But you are aware of what they call me.

13:14.343 --> 13:15.677
I'm aware.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.306
What are you aware of?

13:26.564 --> 13:28.315
<font color="#E767E7">(THANKING IN FRENCH)</font>

13:29.192 --> 13:30.734
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."

13:30.818 --> 13:32.360
Precisely.

13:34.697 --> 13:37.324
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

13:37.408 --> 13:39.701
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

13:39.786 --> 13:42.454
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

13:42.538 --> 13:45.791
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

13:45.875 --> 13:49.211
lt would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

13:49.295 --> 13:52.547
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

13:52.632 --> 13:55.050
precisely because I've earned it.

13:56.469 --> 14:00.514
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

14:00.598 --> 14:03.308
as opposed to most German soldiers,

14:03.392 --> 14:05.393
I can think like a Jew

14:06.062 --> 14:08.772
where they can only think like a German.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.566
<font color="#E767E7">(CHUCKLING)</font> More
precisely, a German soldier.

14:18.241 --> 14:23.203
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

14:23.746 --> 14:27.290
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.586
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

14:31.671 --> 14:33.797
it would be that of the rat.

14:36.592 --> 14:40.428
The F端hrer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.515
But where our conclusions differ,

14:43.599 --> 14:46.601
is I don't consider the
comparison an insult.

14:49.105 --> 14:52.941
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.069
It's a hostile world, indeed.

14:56.904 --> 15:00.282
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

15:00.366 --> 15:02.784
would you greet it with hostility?

15:03.786 --> 15:05.620
I suppose I would.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.247
Has a rat ever done anything to you

15:07.331 --> 15:10.625
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

15:11.544 --> 15:14.170
Rats spread disease. They bite people.

15:14.714 --> 15:18.508
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

15:18.593 --> 15:21.219
I propose to you any
disease a rat could spread,

15:21.304 --> 15:23.763
a squirrel could equally carry.

15:23.848 --> 15:25.432
Would you agree?

15:25.516 --> 15:27.225
<font color="#E767E7">(AGREES IN FRENCH)</font>

15:27.310 --> 15:29.895
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

15:29.979 --> 15:31.980
that you do with rats, do you?

15:32.064 --> 15:33.064
No.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.650
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?

15:35.735 --> 15:39.738
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

15:40.156 --> 15:42.991
It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.

15:43.701 --> 15:45.744
However interesting
as the thought may be,

15:45.828 --> 15:49.080
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

15:51.417 --> 15:55.503
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

15:56.631 --> 16:00.467
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

16:00.551 --> 16:02.010
Probably not.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.387
I didn't think so.

16:05.014 --> 16:06.556
You don't like them.

16:06.641 --> 16:08.516
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.353
All you know is you find them repulsive.

16:13.564 --> 16:16.608
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

16:16.692 --> 16:19.235
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

16:20.154 --> 16:21.738
Where does the hawk look?

16:21.822 --> 16:24.991
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

16:25.076 --> 16:27.535
he looks everywhere he would hide.

16:28.496 --> 16:32.666
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

16:34.919 --> 16:38.588
However, the reason the F端hrer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

16:38.673 --> 16:43.093
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

16:44.345 --> 16:47.681
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

16:47.765 --> 16:49.808
once they abandon dignity.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.728
May I smoke my pipe as well?

16:56.065 --> 16:58.942
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

17:11.705 --> 17:16.751
Now, my job dictates

17:22.090 --> 17:24.759
that I must have my men enter your home

17:28.681 --> 17:30.557
and conduct a thorough search

17:30.641 --> 17:34.436
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

17:35.187 --> 17:39.065
And if there are any irregularities to
be found, rest assured they will be.

17:39.150 --> 17:41.359
That is unless you have
something to tell me

17:41.444 --> 17:44.487
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

17:44.572 --> 17:46.823
I might add, also, that any information

17:46.907 --> 17:51.578
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

17:52.413 --> 17:55.957
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

17:56.459 --> 17:57.751
And that reward will be,

17:57.835 --> 18:00.628
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

18:00.713 --> 18:05.133
by the German military during the
rest of our occupation of your country.

18:15.811 --> 18:19.147
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

18:24.487 --> 18:25.570
Yes.

18:28.491 --> 18:32.410
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

18:34.955 --> 18:35.997
Yes.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.878
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.275

they don't speak English.

from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

22:18.721 --> 22:23.141
and jump out of a fucking airplane to
teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

22:23.225 --> 22:25.310

And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.

22:52.921 --> 22:55.256
We will be cruel to the Germans.

22:55.632 --> 22:58.926
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

22:59.094 --> 23:01.346
And they will find the

23:03.432 --> 23:07.101

23:07.269 --> 23:09.687
And the German won't be

23:09.772 --> 23:13.524
but imagine the cruelty their

23:14.193 --> 23:17.612
and our boot heels and
the edge of our knives.

23:18.989 --> 23:21.366
And the German will be sickened by us.

23:21.450 --> 23:23.659
And the German will talk about us.

23:23.744 --> 23:25.953
And the German will fear us.

And when the German

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.627
I'm a film critic.

01:05:16.254 --> 01:05:18.213
List your accomplishments.

01:05:18.298 --> 01:05:20.173
Well, sir, such as they are,

01:05:20.258 --> 01:05:24.803
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

01:05:24.888 --> 01:05:27.306
and I've had two books published.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:31.226
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

01:05:31.311 --> 01:05:32.311
The first book was called

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:36.899
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

01:05:36.983 --> 01:05:40.819
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

01:05:40.904 --> 01:05:46.241
It's a sub textual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:48.327
What should we drink to, sir?

01:05:48.411 --> 01:05:49.661
Well...

01:05:50.914 --> 01:05:52.873
Down with Hitler.

01:05:52.957 --> 01:05:54.333
All the way down, sir.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:55.959
Yes.

01:05:59.672 --> 01:06:03.759
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

01:06:05.637 --> 01:06:09.848
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

01:06:09.933 --> 01:06:12.184
but I'm familiar with it.

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:13.310
Explain it to me.

01:06:13.978 --> 01:06:15.020
Pardon, sir?

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:19.358
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:24.613
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:29.159
Goebbels considers the films he's making

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:32.496
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:34.623
An alternative to what he considers

01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:37.668
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

01:06:38.378 --> 01:06:41.046
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.714
How's he doing?

01:06:43.257 --> 01:06:45.842
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:50.889
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:54.893
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

01:06:55.728 --> 01:06:57.980
how's he doing?

01:06:58.064 --> 01:06:59.314
Quite well, actually.

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:01.566
Since Goebbels has taken over,

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:06.071
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:09.616
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:13.495
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:19.292
Brief him.

01:07:19.627 --> 01:07:24.673
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:26.383
Three days from now

01:07:26.467 --> 01:07:30.804
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.014
What film, sir?

01:07:32.098 --> 01:07:34.766
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

01:07:35.727 --> 01:07:39.104
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:43.608
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:47.446
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:50.949
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:53.118
The master race at play?

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:57.372
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

01:07:57.457 --> 01:08:00.000
The objective of Operation Kino,

01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:02.669
blow up the basket.

01:08:03.463 --> 01:08:07.549
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.

01:08:08.468 --> 01:08:10.135
Jolly good, sir.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:14.389
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

01:08:14.474 --> 01:08:16.015
will be your assist.

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:19.978
The Germans call them the Basterds.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.732
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:26.734
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

01:08:26.819 --> 01:08:30.822
But the Jerries have heard of them,
because these Yanks have been them the devil.

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:35.618
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

01:08:35.703 --> 01:08:37.787
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

01:08:37.872 --> 01:08:40.624
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:44.544
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

01:08:44.629 --> 01:08:47.798
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

01:08:47.881 --> 01:08:50.008
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

01:08:50.093 --> 01:08:53.845
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:57.349
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

01:08:58.184 --> 01:08:59.350
How will I know her?

01:08:59.477 --> 01:09:02.687
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:06.691
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:08.234

Operation Kino was her brainchild.

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.163

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:31.633
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

01:09:31.716 --> 01:09:33.051

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.553

01:09:35.888 --> 01:09:37.264
Yeah, in a basement.

01:09:37.932 --> 01:09:40.809
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

01:09:40.893 --> 01:09:44.187
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

01:09:44.272 --> 01:09:46.148
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

01:09:46.232 --> 01:09:47.482
We wait.

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:52.404

Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:38.575
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:42.704

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:48.835

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:27.457
Fair point, Lieutenant.

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:32.504
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.798
Make bets on how it all comes out?

01:11:36.008 --> 01:11:39.177
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.598
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

01:11:43.683 --> 01:11:47.852
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:53.024
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

01:11:53.359 --> 01:11:59.030
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

01:12:00.032 --> 01:12:01.449
She chose the spot.

01:12:01.534 --> 01:12:03.159
Isn't that just dandy?

01:12:03.244 --> 01:12:07.205
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.

01:12:07.581 --> 01:12:11.418
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

01:39:17.335 --> 01:39:19.419
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

01:39:19.503 --> 01:39:22.088
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

01:39:22.173 --> 01:39:24.090
What was the next step?

01:39:24.342 --> 01:39:25.550
Tuxedos.

01:39:26.218 --> 01:39:28.970
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

01:39:29.055 --> 01:39:31.848
with all the military
there would've been suicide.

01:39:33.851 --> 01:39:37.103
But going as members of
the German film industry,

01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:40.690
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.

01:39:42.193 --> 01:39:45.362
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

01:39:46.572 --> 01:39:48.990
How'd you intend to get
them in that premiere?

01:39:49.075 --> 01:39:50.700
Hand me my purse.

01:40:00.586 --> 01:40:03.004
Lieutenant Hicox was
going as my escort.

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:08.343
The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.137
You still get us in that premiere?

01:40:11.222 --> 01:40:14.391
You speak German better
than your friends? No.

01:40:14.809 --> 01:40:17.018
Have I been shot? Yes!

01:40:17.561 --> 01:40:22.399
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.

01:40:23.401 --> 01:40:25.819
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

01:40:38.708 --> 01:40:42.002
However, there's
something you don't know.

01:40:44.088 --> 01:40:48.174
There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.

01:40:49.969 --> 01:40:55.056
One, the venue has been changed
from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

01:40:55.599 --> 01:40:58.768
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.

01:40:58.853 --> 01:41:01.813
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

01:41:01.897 --> 01:41:05.608
It probably has something to
do with the second development.

01:41:05.985 --> 01:41:07.277
Which is?

us in that premiere.

I'm probably going to
end up losing this leg.

Bye-bye, acting career.

01:42:16.305 --> 01:42:19.182

He's going to wrap it up in a cast,

01:42:26.565 --> 01:42:28.691
and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

01:42:28.776 --> 01:42:31.444
That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?

01:42:31.529 --> 01:42:34.823
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

01:42:34.907 --> 01:42:36.699
But I see your point.

01:42:36.951 --> 01:42:40.453
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

01:42:40.538 --> 01:42:43.832
and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.

01:42:45.334 --> 01:42:48.586
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,

01:42:48.671 --> 01:42:54.050
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

01:42:54.885 --> 01:42:57.137
We both speak a little ltalian.

01:42:57.221 --> 01:42:59.722
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:04.936
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

01:43:05.729 --> 01:43:08.565
Germans don't have a
good ear for ltalian.

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:16.322
So you mumble ltalian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?

01:43:16.574 --> 01:43:18.199
That's about it.

01:43:22.037 --> 01:43:23.037
That sounds good.

01:43:23.122 --> 01:43:25.498
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?

01:43:25.583 --> 01:43:27.417
No, that sounds good.

01:43:28.252 --> 01:43:32.172
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:38.469
Well, I speak the most ltalian,
so I'll be your escort.

01:43:38.554 --> 01:43:41.681
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.

01:43:41.765 --> 01:43:44.767
Omar, third most. He'll
be Donny's assistant.

both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

02:06:21.832 --> 02:06:25.460
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24,
if my memory serves.

02:06:26.212 --> 02:06:29.631
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:32.968
And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot,

02:06:33.052 --> 02:06:35.554
as of this moment, is still a go.

02:06:35.638 --> 02:06:38.974
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on lce?

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:40.308
However,

02:06:42.186 --> 02:06:45.313
all I have to do is pick
up this phone right here,

02:06:45.398 --> 02:06:48.233
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

02:06:50.653 --> 02:06:55.865
If they're still here, and if they're
still alive, and that's one big if,

02:06:57.201 --> 02:06:58.994
there ain't no way you're
going to take them boys

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:00.704
without setting off them bombs.

02:07:00.788 --> 02:07:02.539
I have no doubt.

02:07:02.623 --> 02:07:05.917
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

02:07:06.002 --> 02:07:08.920
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

02:07:09.005 --> 02:07:11.089
for what you've done to his big night.

02:07:12.341 --> 02:07:14.634
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

02:07:14.719 --> 02:07:17.762
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

02:07:17.847 --> 02:07:20.432
And you need all four to end the war.

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:25.270
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

02:07:25.354 --> 02:07:27.689
you may very well get all four.

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:33.778
And if you get all four, you end the war

02:07:35.031 --> 02:07:36.281
tonight.

02:07:37.658 --> 02:07:39.200
So, gentlemen,

02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:43.121
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

02:07:46.042 --> 02:07:47.876
So, the way I see it,

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:52.172
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:54.424
if I do nothing,

02:07:54.842 --> 02:07:57.552
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.

02:07:57.637 --> 02:07:58.887
Wouldn't you agree?

02:07:59.555 --> 02:08:00.889
I guess so.

02:08:03.476 --> 02:08:05.477
How about you, Utivich?

02:08:05.561 --> 02:08:07.187
I guess so, too.

02:08:12.735 --> 02:08:13.985
Gentlemen, l have no intention

02:08:14.070 --> 02:08:17.155
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,

02:08:17.239 --> 02:08:19.991
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

02:08:20.076 --> 02:08:23.828
only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.

02:08:25.915 --> 02:08:29.459
If you want to win the war tonight,

02:08:31.087 --> 02:08:33.254
we have to make a deal.

02:08:36.258 --> 02:08:38.009
What kind of deal?

02:08:38.094 --> 02:08:40.637
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

02:08:40.721 --> 02:08:45.266
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.

02:08:46.268 --> 02:08:47.602
A general.

02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:49.938
I'm betting for...

02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:53.566
OSS would be my guess.

That's a bingo!

02:09:02.952 --> 02:09:05.453
Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."

02:09:05.538 --> 02:09:07.414
You just say, "Bingo."

02:09:07.498 --> 02:09:09.749
Bingo! How fun.

02:09:12.169 --> 02:09:15.255
But I digress. Where were
we? Yeah! Make a deal.

02:09:15.798 --> 02:09:20.218
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

02:09:20.302 --> 02:09:24.472
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

02:09:24.807 --> 02:09:27.142
Get me someone on the
other end of that radio

02:09:27.226 --> 02:09:30.270
with the power of the
pen to authorize my,

02:09:30.354 --> 02:09:33.273
let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.

02:09:33.357 --> 02:09:35.775
If that tastes better going down.

02:09:36.569 --> 02:09:37.819
You know, where I'm from...

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:39.779
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

02:09:39.864 --> 02:09:41.906
Maynardville, Tennessee.

02:09:41.991 --> 02:09:44.451
I've done my share of bootlegging.

02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:48.329
Up there, if you engage in what the
federal government calls illegal activity,

02:09:48.414 --> 02:09:50.540
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family

02:09:50.624 --> 02:09:55.044
selling moonshine liquor, it
behooves oneself to keep his wits.

02:09:57.006 --> 02:10:00.425
Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,

02:10:01.093 --> 02:10:02.343
it ain't.

02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:06.931
Sitting in your chair, l would
probably say the same thing,

02:10:07.016 --> 02:10:11.728
