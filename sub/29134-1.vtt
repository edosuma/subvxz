00:47.381 --> 00:51.083
      (clapperboard snaps)

00:51.285 --> 00:52.184
- [Interviewer] Ah, Mr. Mahoney,

00:52.186 --> 00:54.720
     thank you for speaking
     with us today.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.588
    - Ah, it's my pleasure.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.257
  - [Interviewer] I understand
  recounting what you saw

00:58.259 --> 01:01.193
      is difficult and
      it's appreciated.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.930
- Well, I think it's important.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.567
      What happened to
      those kids out there

01:09.637 --> 01:10.769
 I think it needs to be told

01:10.771 --> 01:13.338
so it just never happens again.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.107
  - [Interviewer] I understand
  you spent some time

01:15.109 --> 01:16.442
 with them before the incident.

01:16.444 --> 01:19.278
        - Yes, a little.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.612
      - [Interviewer] Was
      there any indication

01:20.614 --> 01:22.214
      that you can think
      of of their behavior

01:22.216 --> 01:23.849
     that would lead to?

01:23.851 --> 01:29.555
     - No, no they seemed
     like just normal kids.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.557
 - [Interviewer] After
 reviewing the autopsy reports

01:31.559 --> 01:36.862
and the pictures, what
happened out there was extreme.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.164
             - Yes.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.067
- [Interviewer] Self inflicted?

01:43.571 --> 01:47.506
    - (sighs) Inconclusive.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.177
      - [Interviewer] It's
      difficult to accept

01:52.179 --> 01:55.747
  that a group of people would
  do something to themselves.

01:55.749 --> 01:59.952
  - You know I'm, I'm gonna
  stop you right there.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.789
      You know people just
      don't understand

02:03.791 --> 02:06.992
      that the woods are a
      very beautiful place

02:07.161 --> 02:13.432
  but they're very dark,
  dangerous and mysterious.

02:16.270 --> 02:20.839
    And something like this
    could happen to anyone.

02:20.908 --> 02:26.745
 You, me and just find
 yourself at the wrong place

02:28.616 --> 02:30.983
       at the wrong time.

02:32.186 --> 02:38.390
     And it's amazing what
     your mind can justify.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.994
        (ominous music)

04:14.822 --> 04:17.990
      - Oh, oh hi, oh
      whoa, who's that?

04:17.992 --> 04:19.190
   Who's that handsome devil?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.358
 Well that's Russell Delphino,

04:20.361 --> 04:23.262
    or some people call him,
    the Delphino Albino.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.431
    And this is another
    episode of, how did this

04:26.433 --> 04:28.734
     fucked-up shit happen
     and why do we care?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.869
 - (sighs) All right would
 you stop wasting gigabytes,

04:30.871 --> 04:34.006
  I'm tired of looking at your
  fucked-up face while I edit.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.540
    - [Russell] (laughs)
    Oh ladies and gentlemen

04:35.542 --> 04:38.143
  on my left in the
  driver's seat is a woman,

04:38.145 --> 04:40.078
     which is only slightly
     worse of an idea

04:40.080 --> 04:42.047
  as maybe an asian driver.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.449
      - Okay, fuck you!

04:44.451 --> 04:45.951
- (laughs) Geez eas, whoa easy!

04:45.953 --> 04:50.155
 Jesus, what are you, a moth
 attracted to headlights?

04:50.157 --> 04:51.857
         Jesus Christ!

04:51.859 --> 04:54.793
 Oh, uh oh, oh hey princess.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.862
 Hey, oh waking from your nap?

04:56.864 --> 05:00.866
 Oh, do you need to stop
 and piss for the 86th time?

05:00.868 --> 05:02.067
 - I can't help it, I've got a

05:02.069 --> 05:03.702
     - [All] small bladder!

05:03.704 --> 05:04.970
      - [Russell] We know.

05:04.972 --> 05:05.837
         - Thanks guys.

05:05.839 --> 05:09.508
     - [Russell] Hey who is
     that handsome devil?

05:09.510 --> 05:12.511
 I think that's the second most
 handsome devil in the car.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.679
 - You mean, this old thing,

05:13.681 --> 05:16.982
    stop it! (laughs)
    - Hey, second handsome,

05:16.984 --> 05:18.483
     can I get some chips?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.151
          - Of course.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.053
     Do you want a Molly
     special cool ranch

05:21.055 --> 05:24.856
  or would you like a spicy
  nacho, a jalapeno cheddar

05:24.858 --> 05:26.458
     or you want OG Dorito?

05:26.460 --> 05:29.161
       - A Molly special.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.829
  - God damn, what else do you
  have in that man purse Mike?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.765
 - Don't be jealous, I have a
 little something for everyone.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.666
     (chip packet crackles)

05:34.668 --> 05:36.168
       - Hey whoa, easy
       you piece of shit.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.937
           (laughing)

05:39.673 --> 05:41.540
        - [Russell] Ooh.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.344
     Ooh, ooh.
     - What are you doing?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.446
    - [Russell] Nah,
    nothing, just trying to

05:47.448 --> 05:50.248
 exercise some demons. (laughs)

05:50.250 --> 05:53.752
 The power of Christ compels
 me to touch your nipples!

05:53.754 --> 05:55.520
      I need an old one
      and a young one

05:55.522 --> 05:58.023
    and a slightly droopier
    one than the other.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.291
- [Molly] All right we're here!

05:59.293 --> 06:00.158
      - [Becca] Thank god.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.894
       (gravel crunching)

06:02.896 --> 06:06.665
      (gentle piano music)

06:16.777 --> 06:20.245
      (car door clicks)

06:20.981 --> 06:23.281
     - (sighs) You made it!

06:23.517 --> 06:24.916
       (car door thuds)
       You must be Molly?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.585
   - I am, you must be Lance.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.353
     - Pleasure to meet ya.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.121
       How was the drive?

06:29.123 --> 06:30.088
        - Oh stunning!
        (car door thuds)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.022
  It is so beautiful out here.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.593
  - Ah, thank you, my family's
  been here for generations.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.094
    - Well your property
    is absolutely gorgeous.

06:36.096 --> 06:41.066
     - Oh, well, years ago
     the military crossed
     into our property

06:41.068 --> 06:44.970
     and law suits,
     yada yada. (laughs)

06:44.972 --> 06:47.973
     Oh, you guys don't
     waste any time I see.

06:47.975 --> 06:52.477
  - Yeah, it's a
  documentary, we document.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.514
- That's right, we do document.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.815
We try to get everything we can.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.617
    We usually end up
    cutting like, 90% of it,

06:58.619 --> 07:00.685
    but it's just good to
    have more than we need.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.455
       - No, no need to
       explain, I get it.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.190
       - You get many
       visitors out here?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.892
    - Ah, we don't actually.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.262
  Years ago, journalists
  hounded my dad day and night

07:10.264 --> 07:12.030
 but that was a long time ago.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.800
In fact it's why I was kinda
surprised when you guys called.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.702
 This is certainly the largest
 film crew we've ever had here.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.505
 - Well we appreciate you
 letting us stay here and film,

07:20.507 --> 07:21.573
  I know it's a lot to ask.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.142
  - Ah, don't worry about
  it, you can thank my dad,

07:24.144 --> 07:25.544
   he's the one who insisted.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.613
     - [Wendy] Hey um,
     where's the bathroom?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.148
   - Are you fucking serious?

07:30.150 --> 07:30.749
        - I have to pee!

07:30.751 --> 07:33.718
 - [Lance] (laughs) It's all
 right, let me show you inside.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.386
          - Thank you.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.389
     (footsteps crunching)

07:37.391 --> 07:39.191
      - Fucking actors!

07:39.326 --> 07:43.028
       Say your line,
       line sayer, Jesus!

07:43.030 --> 07:46.031
     (footsteps crunching)

07:46.033 --> 07:49.267
  - Hey intern, why don't
  we play a fun little game

07:49.269 --> 07:50.469
     called carry the bags.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.504
          (laughing)
          - All right.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.474
  - Hey!
  - You can have it back after

07:55.476 --> 07:56.708
      you've done what
      you've been told.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.344
   Hey, you're the one who
   wanted to be part of this.

07:59.346 --> 08:02.747
     - Oh, I got so fucking
     badly wanted to be

08:02.749 --> 08:08.787
       part of this crew.
       (suitcase thuds)

08:09.223 --> 08:13.358
  (door clicks)
  - Here we are, after you.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.194
    Bathroom is to the left

08:16.196 --> 08:18.964
       and the rest of us
       can head up top.

08:20.300 --> 08:26.137
         - Jesus.
         (door clicks)

08:29.042 --> 08:31.476
      - Well, here we are.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.746
     Three bedrooms,
     including the master.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.914
     Little bit of a tight
     fit for six people,

08:36.917 --> 08:39.851
     but I think you'll be
     able to figure it out.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.221
      We have hot water of
      course, fire place.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.524
   Looks like I'm a little
   low on firewood right now.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.293
 - That's okay, I can split
 some later if there's a pile.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.929
  - [Lance] Sure there's a
  shed out back, thank you.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.430
   - [Molly] Ah, do you think
   after we get settled in

08:52.432 --> 08:55.867
   we can meet Mr. Mahoney,
   get a few prelim questions

08:55.869 --> 08:56.601
        out of the way?

08:56.603 --> 09:00.005
     - I, uh, I'm not sure
     that's a good idea.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.406
      - [Molly] Oh, uh.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.708
     - It's just that it's
     been a rough day.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.944
  You know, the Alzheimer's
  takes him in and out.

09:05.946 --> 09:08.113
  You're welcome to stop by
  and meet him if you like

09:08.115 --> 09:09.981
     but honestly I don't
     think you're gonna get

09:09.983 --> 09:12.150
     any of your questions
     answered tonight.

09:12.152 --> 09:15.153
  - I understand, my
  grandmother had Alzheimer's,

09:15.155 --> 09:16.621
         so, I get it.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.326
     Ah, this is is Wendy,
     she's our host.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.563
    Maybe she and I can pop
    by later and say hello.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.298
Just the two of us, no cameras.

09:26.300 --> 09:30.235
 - Sure, I don't, I don't
 think that'll be a problem.

09:31.104 --> 09:31.736
         (Molly sighs)

09:31.738 --> 09:35.707
 But I don't think I would
 wear that shirt if I were you.

09:35.776 --> 09:39.077
      Sorry it's just, the
      old man's a little,

09:39.880 --> 09:40.612
    little set in his ways.

09:40.614 --> 09:45.250
     He doesn't take kindly
     to new-wave thinkers.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.352
   - New, (laughs) I'm sorry?

09:47.354 --> 09:50.288
     - No, I don't mean
     to offend, it's just,

09:50.290 --> 09:53.391
     we're not used to the
     gays up here you know.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.799
    - No worries, I
    understand, completely.

10:00.801 --> 10:04.202
 - Hey, do you guys have any
 like, quinoa, gluten-free,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.304
    dairy-free kinda foods?

10:07.074 --> 10:10.141
    - I, I don't understand
    what you're saying.

10:10.143 --> 10:10.909
         - Ignore her.

10:10.911 --> 10:14.212
   Apparently it works
   exclusively with assholes.

10:15.782 --> 10:16.381
          - I'm sorry.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.616
     Well listen, the
     refrigerator's stocked

10:17.618 --> 10:20.852
  and the stove and the oven
  works if that helps you any.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.021
     And if you need
     anything else at all,

10:23.023 --> 10:24.389
   feel free to come on over.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.925
 Oh, and by the way, there's
 no cell service here.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.994
    So if you need to make a
    call, there's a landline

10:28.996 --> 10:31.162
in the main house, in case
there's an emergency or anything

10:31.164 --> 10:33.865
   and if you need to go into
   town, you'll have to drive

10:33.867 --> 10:36.234
  around the mountain road,
  same way you came in.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.669
     A little windy,
     little long of course,

10:37.671 --> 10:40.271
     or you could just hike
     through the mountains,

10:40.273 --> 10:41.840
it's about four miles from here.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.575
    - [Molly] Thanks Lance,
    we appreciate it.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.210
    - [Lance] See you soon.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.884
         (gentle music)

11:22.983 --> 11:24.516
            (sighs)

11:24.518 --> 11:27.385
         (bag thuds)

11:34.761 --> 11:36.428
        - Fucking sluts!

11:47.941 --> 11:48.640
          (ball thuds)

11:48.642 --> 11:50.008
     - Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:50.010 --> 11:51.209
   Should we be filming this?

11:51.211 --> 11:54.546
 - He's had a rough night, I
 don't wanna overwhelm him.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.647
- Since when did you give a fuck

11:55.649 --> 11:56.514
about exploiting your subjects?

11:56.516 --> 12:00.351
     - (sighs) Listen,
     I'm just trying to be
     sensitive all right?

12:00.353 --> 12:03.288
    Relax and keep playing
    with each other's balls.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.589
 - That's fine, I brought two.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.826
     - [Noah] Not gonna
     get anything from him!

12:07.828 --> 12:11.529
     (footsteps crunching)

12:11.531 --> 12:12.630
          - Excuse me?

12:12.632 --> 12:14.032
         - My grandpa.

12:14.101 --> 12:19.104
 Not gonna get anything, you
 just couldn't find online.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.238
 You know maybe that's where

12:20.240 --> 12:22.173
      you lazy fucks
      should have started!

12:22.175 --> 12:24.476
      - Hey what the fuck,
      you little shit!

12:24.478 --> 12:25.677
        - Russell stop!

12:25.679 --> 12:30.849
     - You know, why don't
     you guys just go home?

12:35.722 --> 12:36.988
        - What a prick.

12:36.990 --> 12:37.922
          - Shit head.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.690
     - Guys it's all right.

12:38.692 --> 12:42.627
     Just let it go, he's
     just being protective.

12:43.630 --> 12:47.499
     (footsteps crunching)

12:52.239 --> 12:53.037
          (ball thuds)

12:53.039 --> 12:53.772
         (door clicks)

12:53.774 --> 12:56.741
  - [Lance] I'm sorry about
  Noah, he gets a little antsy

12:56.743 --> 12:58.943
 when strangers come around.

12:58.945 --> 12:59.711
         (door clicks)

12:59.713 --> 13:02.680
  - [Molly] Well, hopefully
  he'll warm up to us.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.817
 - So, I was thinking we could
 do the interview in here.

13:05.819 --> 13:09.420
    It's got plenty of space
    and this works for you.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.321
     - Yeah, this is great.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.423
   I mean, it's a little dark
   but we've got some lights

13:12.425 --> 13:14.993
 we can set up, so no problem.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.328
     - Hey, um, who's this?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.130
   - That's my mother, Cathy.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.800
      She passed away
      when I was young.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.670
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.039
 Gosh, she's really beautiful.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.709
      - Yeah, thank you,
      was a long time ago.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.547
     So, let's ah, go see
     the old man, shall we?

13:36.449 --> 13:37.615
    Oh hey, word of warning.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.384
     I don't know how
     coherent he's gonna be

13:39.386 --> 13:42.387
   and if he acts out at all,
   don't take it personally.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.656
 You know, he has his moments.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.792
      But tonight, so far,
      he's pretty somber.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.063
          Hey pops?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.898
  Got a couple of visitors.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.936
    (foreboding piano music)

14:12.419 --> 14:13.785
         - Mr. Mahoney?

14:16.022 --> 14:20.258
     - Hi, my name is
     Wendy, how are you?

14:22.462 --> 14:23.828
          - I'm Molly.

14:25.665 --> 14:29.601
 We're here to interview you
 about the pass incident.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.871
    Do you remember talking
    to me on the phone?

14:37.711 --> 14:40.545
      (sighs) Mr. Mahoney?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.184
    Sorry to bother you sir.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.121
       - Maybe he'll feel
       better tomorrow.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.723
     - [Wendy] Let's go.

14:54.861 --> 14:55.326
            - Cathy.

14:55.328 --> 14:58.730
     - Dad no, that,
     that, that's not mom.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.198
            - Cathy.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.401
- He thinks all women are Cathy.

15:05.538 --> 15:09.007
      (heavy breathing)

15:09.009 --> 15:11.009
    - Why did you leave me?

15:14.681 --> 15:17.282
    Why did you have to go?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.019
             Cathy.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.721
              Why?

15:25.659 --> 15:26.424
    - [Michael] How was it?

15:26.426 --> 15:27.892
 Is he has crazy as people say?

15:27.894 --> 15:28.626
          - He's fine.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.296
       - [Russell] Should
       have filmed it.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.133
     - 'Cause I heard after
     he found the bodies,

15:35.135 --> 15:37.402
    he went round the bend.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.637
    - Okay no, first of all,
    we want him to trust us.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.674
 Okay, we're not trying to
 damage his psyche any more.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.375
       And no he didn't
       go round the bend,

15:44.377 --> 15:48.546
   but he is sad, he lost his
   wife for Christ's sake.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.280
     - Who gives a shit?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.616
     He's a crazy old man
     who's gonna forget you

15:51.618 --> 15:52.684
     in 10 minutes anyways.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.686
 He's got fuckin' old timers

15:54.688 --> 15:55.920
      or whatever the
      hell it's called.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.556
       - God dammit Russ,
       shut the fuck up!

15:58.558 --> 16:01.025
    He's old and he's sick!

16:01.027 --> 16:03.628
      And people died
      here, right here!

16:03.630 --> 16:06.898
     What this guy saw
     really fucked him up!

16:06.967 --> 16:10.335
  So be a man and start taking
  this shit more seriously.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.603
      You're not funny,
      you're not cute.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.806
  You're a fuckin' asshole!

16:14.908 --> 16:18.042
    And these people deserve
    better than that.

16:22.015 --> 16:25.383
     - Well Jesus, who
     shit in her Cheerios?

16:26.252 --> 16:27.452
         - Apparently,

16:27.454 --> 16:29.220
           (thudding)
           you did.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.257
       - Fucking asshole.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.362
- What about you Mother Theresa?

16:37.864 --> 16:39.297
          Short stack?

16:42.035 --> 16:43.701
        Fuck this shit!

16:43.903 --> 16:47.772
     (footsteps crunching)

16:50.543 --> 16:56.447
      (heavy breathing)
      (grunts)

16:56.516 --> 16:57.015
            - Molly?

16:57.017 --> 16:57.982
 You can't take him personally.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.650
     - He's such a
     fucking douche bag!

16:59.652 --> 17:02.186
 - I know, I know, you just,
 you have to ignore him.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.521
  - No fuck that, I'm tired of
  always having to be the one

17:04.523 --> 17:07.492
     to accept that that's
     just who he is!

17:07.594 --> 17:09.594
 - You're right, you're right.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.662
  - (heavy breathing) What?

17:11.897 --> 17:12.829
     No, no, no, no, no.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.366
     Corrupted file, fuck!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.101
      - Hey, calm down.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.270
   - Don't tell me to calm
   down, this is our footage!

17:19.271 --> 17:21.705
     - I know, and we've
     got it backed up.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.009
 - Oh god. (heavy breathing)

17:25.011 --> 17:25.943
            Oh fuck.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.377
       Oh god, not again,
       please. (gasping)

17:27.380 --> 17:30.782
     - Okay come here,
     come here, come here.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.550
        Shh, calm down.

17:33.953 --> 17:37.088
        (Molly gasps)
        Relax, I got ya.

17:39.259 --> 17:45.129
      - Sometimes I just
      feel so overwhelmed,
      like I can't breath.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.864
         - Yep, I know.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.202
Hey, let me get you some water.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.770
      - Okay thank you.
      (heavy breathing)

17:52.772 --> 17:56.741
  - Course, gotta take
  care of my people, right?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.545
        (deep breathing)

18:00.547 --> 18:04.816
  (upbeat electronic music)

18:26.072 --> 18:26.637
           (knocking)

18:26.639 --> 18:29.774
     - Hey, you're missing
     out on all the fun.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.175
 - I'm not really in the mood.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.044
  - Oh come on, don't do this.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.745
     - Just wanna get
     some work done Becca.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.682
      - You'll have plenty
      of time later.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.084
            (sighs)

18:40.286 --> 18:42.420
     - Are you drinking?

18:42.422 --> 18:44.055
            - Maybe.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.557
       Why don't you come
       and found out?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.798
            (sighs)

18:53.800 --> 18:58.069
  (upbeat electronic music)

19:40.280 --> 19:43.748
    - (sighs) I'm so bored.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.284
         What ya up to?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.252
         - I'm editing.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.654
        - Editing what?

19:49.656 --> 19:51.055
         - Our footage.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.291
        - Oh, can I see?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.296
   Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.798
    You have to delete that
    one, that's a bad angle.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.833
    I look fat, delete that!

20:02.835 --> 20:04.535
     - Okay can I help you?

20:04.537 --> 20:08.806
  (upbeat electronic music)

20:18.484 --> 20:19.383
           - Hey Mol.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.384
             - Hmm.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.587
  - Do you find me attractive?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.190
    - You know you are, stop
    fishing for compliments.

20:26.192 --> 20:30.461
  (upbeat electronic music)

20:33.700 --> 20:36.534
    - I got rejected twice.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.775
  (upbeat electronic music)

20:46.579 --> 20:49.714
      Do you know the last
      time I got laid was?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.918
         Okay, Okay.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.255
  You don't have to give
  me the stare, I'll leave.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.023
          (sighing)

20:59.025 --> 21:04.428
     - You know, I could
     fuck you if you want.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.065
            - What?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.202
     You're not serious.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.705
         (door clicks)
         - Why not?

21:14.707 --> 21:16.407
         I'll fuck you.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.276
    (slow electronic music)

21:18.278 --> 21:19.510
            - Okay.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.548
        (lips smacking)

21:24.550 --> 21:28.019
      (heavy breathing)

21:30.123 --> 21:32.256
           (laughing)

21:32.258 --> 21:35.459
        (lips smacking)

21:36.296 --> 21:39.830
       (electronic music)

23:25.405 --> 23:26.203
           (laughing)

23:26.205 --> 23:30.741
 You know I'm not as shallow
 as everyone thinks I am.

23:31.344 --> 23:32.276
          - I know.

23:32.278 --> 23:35.079
     - (laughs) Seriously.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.482
  - We just had sex because
  you felt rejected.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.750
        You are shallow.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.853
     But it's okay
     though, I like you.

23:44.323 --> 23:49.493
  - You don't, you don't think
  I'm that shallow, do you?

23:49.762 --> 23:52.129
       - Yeah, yeah I do.

23:52.265 --> 23:55.766
  But you're an actor, it's
  kinda part of your job,

23:55.768 --> 23:58.869
supposed to be vain, it's cool.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.638
        I'm shallow too.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.374
           (laughing)

24:07.480 --> 24:09.180
     - And that's pretty
     much why I don't do

24:09.182 --> 24:09.914
    the butt stuff anymore.

24:09.916 --> 24:14.652
     I mean, I bel, I'm a
     tit guy mostly and...

24:20.693 --> 24:22.560
           Oh hey,
           (laughing)

24:22.562 --> 24:24.028
      what were you two
      doing in there?

24:24.030 --> 24:26.363
       - None of your
       god damn business!

24:26.365 --> 24:30.134
 - Could you please not take
 the lord's name in vain.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.737
    - Oh sure, none of
    your god damn business!

24:33.739 --> 24:34.872
          (hissing)

24:34.874 --> 24:36.474
      - Go talk to her.

24:40.446 --> 24:41.946
    So that was interesting.

24:41.948 --> 24:42.480
            - Yeah.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.415
    - I could tell Molly was
    definitely up to no good

24:44.417 --> 24:47.184
  and then the artist formally
  known as the disco blueberry

24:47.186 --> 24:52.490
 went bouncing down the stairs.
 (laughing)

24:55.628 --> 24:58.829
        (clears throat)

24:59.232 --> 25:01.232
   - Are you still mad at me?

25:01.901 --> 25:04.969
     - I don't know, maybe.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.371
            (sighs)

25:08.040 --> 25:13.878
 - All right, fine, I'm sorry.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.646
 Uh and you, you know how much

25:15.648 --> 25:17.781
that hurts my face to say that.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.317
      I don't know how
      you people do it.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.053
        Like... (sighs)

25:23.122 --> 25:28.659
You're right, maybe I was being
a little bit of an asshole.

25:29.161 --> 25:35.232
    But (sighs) I know this
    is important to you

25:35.368 --> 25:38.135
      and that makes it
      important to me.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.304
         - Thanks Russ.

25:40.506 --> 25:46.710
  - Like 40%, 40% important
  and that is a lot.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.946
    Like, my mom's like 31.

25:48.948 --> 25:53.050
And, like, ice cream's like 17,

25:53.052 --> 25:56.453
  'cause I'm lactose
  intolerant and like kittens,

25:56.455 --> 25:58.756
         are like six.

25:59.592 --> 26:03.561
       They're zero, I
       fuckin' hate cats.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.030
       I mean like, I
       wanna support you.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.032
I'm like your Victoria's Secret.

26:08.034 --> 26:12.136
     You know, yeah, okay,
     like an underwire bra.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.339
 You know, how it holds up
 the big set of ugly floppers.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.541
 Like, I mean, not like yours,

26:17.543 --> 26:18.709
not that you have ugly floppers.

26:18.711 --> 26:19.810
 You got like a respectable C,

26:19.812 --> 26:21.645
   but like what I'm saying
   is like a water bra's fake

26:21.647 --> 26:26.584
  and guys know but like, a
  supportive underwire bra,

26:26.586 --> 26:28.252
         is, it's...

26:28.254 --> 26:29.653
        - Stop talking.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.488
            - Right.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.234
        - Ugly floppers?

26:47.873 --> 26:51.442
       (electronic music)

26:53.045 --> 26:54.311
      - [Russell] And that
      is the second time

26:54.313 --> 26:56.747
     I got it stuck in
     the vacuum cleaner.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.749
           (laughing)

26:58.751 --> 27:01.185
     - Whoa, whoa, whoa,
     whoa, whoa, whoa,

27:01.187 --> 27:02.753
  save some for the fishes.

27:02.755 --> 27:06.357
     - Hannah, you should
     go to bed, it's late.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.660
    - Becca, it's not even
    midnight, I'm not five.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.528
 - Yeah Becca, she's not five!

27:11.530 --> 27:12.563
        Here you go kid.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.264
      - [Becca] Hey you
      can't have that!

27:14.266 --> 27:16.533
       - Well lighten up,
       it's just a sip.

27:16.535 --> 27:18.369
     - Yeah, she's not
     gonna be snortin' coke

27:18.371 --> 27:20.504
      off a hooker's thigh
      for like, what,

27:20.506 --> 27:22.873
    your birthday's in
    like four months right?

27:22.875 --> 27:25.409
           (laughing)

27:25.411 --> 27:26.877
     - That's not funny.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.312
    - It's not, you laughed.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.515
     - (laughs) Is there
     like, anything else

27:31.517 --> 27:36.520
 we can do around here besides
 drink and stuff, you know?

27:36.522 --> 27:38.255
    - What do you wanna do?

27:38.257 --> 27:39.690
         - Hmm well.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.360
  We could tell scary stories.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.862
          - [All] Ooh!

27:44.964 --> 27:48.032
      - I think Michael
      knows a scary story.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.133
     - [Michael] Like what?

27:49.135 --> 27:51.035
     - I think we both
     know a scary story.

27:51.037 --> 27:56.140
  I think, uh maybe like,
  Wendy's face without makeup.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.274
   - Hey guys, what'd I miss?

27:57.276 --> 27:58.609
      - Huh, this dick!

27:58.611 --> 28:01.712
   - Oh good, I thought I
   was missing something big.

28:01.714 --> 28:02.913
           (laughing)
           - Ooh!

28:02.915 --> 28:06.483
     - Ah hah, you do
     have a micro-penis.

28:06.485 --> 28:07.184
           (laughing)

28:07.186 --> 28:10.087
      - It is a recognized
      medical condition.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.121
        (Hannah laughs)

28:11.123 --> 28:14.358
    - Oh, actually I wanna
    know what happened here.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.426
 - You haven't told her Becca?

28:15.428 --> 28:19.496
  - I gave her the Cliff Notes
  version, she's too young.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.398
     - Okay, yeah but
     she's part of the crew

28:21.400 --> 28:22.833
     and if you want
     her to be involved,

28:22.835 --> 28:25.035
  she should know the details.

28:25.037 --> 28:25.936
      - Did you hear that?

28:25.938 --> 28:28.706
     I'm part of the crew,
     is that what you said?

28:28.708 --> 28:29.606
   Wow, I'm part of the crew.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.475
  - [Michael] You really wanna
  know what happened here kid?

28:31.477 --> 28:33.677
    - Yeah I wanna know what
    happened to the old man.

28:33.679 --> 28:37.414
    - Well, the real problem
    there is, Russell's mom

28:37.416 --> 28:38.215
    never hugged him enough.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.351
  - It's true and my dad and
  my uncle hugged me too much.

28:41.353 --> 28:41.985
           (laughing)

28:41.987 --> 28:45.556
- No, I didn't mean this old
man, I meant the other old man.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.825
            (laughs)

28:47.827 --> 28:48.726
            (sighs)

28:48.728 --> 28:50.961
    - Back in the 70s, bunch
    of college students

28:50.963 --> 28:54.164
  came up to hike the pass
  and they were experienced

28:54.166 --> 28:58.402
   and they were prepared and
   then something happened,

28:58.404 --> 28:59.703
  and they all disappeared.

28:59.705 --> 29:03.340
    It took 'em over a month
    to find the bodies.

29:03.476 --> 29:05.275
 - Well what happened to them?

29:05.277 --> 29:06.443
     - Nobody really knows.

29:06.445 --> 29:10.013
Old man came up to the campsite,
found all the tents empty,

29:10.015 --> 29:12.950
 food still in the skillets, so
 he figures they go on a hike.

29:12.952 --> 29:16.920
  But then he sees a single
  shoe so he keeps walkin'.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.223
      And then he finds
      the first body.

29:19.225 --> 29:22.793
    - A little bit further,
    two more bodies.

29:22.795 --> 29:27.097
    One of 'em, tongue
    ripped out of his mouth.

29:27.099 --> 29:33.170
    The other one, eyes
    gouged out of the skull.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.772
     - And they had hardly
     any external injuries

29:34.774 --> 29:36.540
     and they couldn't tell
     whether they did it

29:36.542 --> 29:38.709
  to themselves or each other.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.711
      And they all had
      internal bleeding

29:40.713 --> 29:42.379
 but nobody knows from what.

29:42.381 --> 29:42.980
             - Ew.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.348
  - Well that's disgusting.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.884
 So what does that even have
 to do with the old man.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.219
     - Well he was the
     park ranger back then

29:49.221 --> 29:50.754
       and they stayed
       with him for a day

29:50.756 --> 29:51.755
  before heading up the trail.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.824
     He was the last one
     to see them alive.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.592
     - And the first one
     to see 'em dead.

29:55.594 --> 29:58.629
    - Yeah, and then really
    fucked him up too.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.731
      - Can you blame him?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.367
    - Do you think we'll get
    the interview we want?

30:03.369 --> 30:06.470
    - (sighs) God I hope so.

30:06.539 --> 30:09.907
    'Cause if not we're here
    for no fuckin' reason.

30:12.745 --> 30:13.777
 We should probably go to bed.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.679
  We gotta be ready to roll
  at any time tomorrow.

30:15.681 --> 30:19.817
 - [Russell] Yep, all right kid
 finish this for me will ya?

30:22.621 --> 30:23.754
           - Hey Mol.

30:23.756 --> 30:24.988
            - Yeah.

30:25.057 --> 30:28.258
    - I just wanna let you
    know that I except you.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.127
            - What?

30:30.129 --> 30:33.764
  - I except you, who you are.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.168
 You know, the whole gay thing.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.305
 - Right, yeah, the gay thing.

30:41.307 --> 30:44.374
 - I don't judge, only he can.

30:44.810 --> 30:46.310
   I love you no matter what!

30:46.312 --> 30:47.744
         - Oh, okay.

30:47.847 --> 30:51.014
      Well thanks for your
      approval. (laughs)

30:51.016 --> 30:53.083
      It really gets me
      through my day.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.686
 - Okay no problem, good night!

30:55.688 --> 30:58.121
     - [Molly] Good night.

31:01.727 --> 31:05.495
      (gentle piano music)

31:49.775 --> 31:50.641
     (frying pan crackles)

31:50.643 --> 31:53.410
     - Hey Becca, what's
     the wifi password?

31:53.412 --> 31:56.546
         (Becca laughs)

31:57.049 --> 31:57.781
             What?

31:57.783 --> 31:59.917
    - There's no wifi here.

31:59.919 --> 32:00.717
           - Why not?

32:00.719 --> 32:03.687
 - You're gonna have to deal
 with the beautiful outdoors

32:03.689 --> 32:05.489
     for once in your life.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.393
      - Hmm, that's gross.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.062
    - Hey, you're surrounded
    by God's creation,

32:12.064 --> 32:15.065
      you need to learn
      to appreciate it.

32:17.002 --> 32:17.701
      - I'm not hungry.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.670
     - Hanna, y--
     - I'm gonna go outside

32:19.672 --> 32:22.906
 and experience God's
 wonderful creation for once

32:22.908 --> 32:24.875
and maybe his cell service too.

32:24.877 --> 32:26.743
      - Good luck, hey,
      don't go too far.

32:26.745 --> 32:30.013
     You need to keep
     yourself available in
     case people need you.

32:30.015 --> 32:33.150
 - Oh, 'cause I'm officially
 everyone's bitch.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.518
        - [Becca] Hanna.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.222
  - So who's the bitch now?

32:39.224 --> 32:39.923
          Oh toast!

32:39.925 --> 32:41.425
             (slap)
             Ow!

32:42.161 --> 32:43.493
           Thank you.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.362
      - You're welcome.

32:47.232 --> 32:49.099
         (axe chopping)

32:49.101 --> 32:52.602
       (insects chirping)

32:54.606 --> 32:57.274
    - Hey there you pretty
    boy, Paul Bunyan bitch.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.876
    Want me to show you how
    a real man chops wood?

32:59.878 --> 33:02.245
- Yeah, you wanna go get Molly?

33:02.247 --> 33:04.314
        - Oh, fuck you.

33:04.984 --> 33:08.585
     Ah, hey ah, Sister
     Mary Rebecca in there

33:08.587 --> 33:11.688
     made some Jesus toast
     if you want a piece.

33:11.690 --> 33:12.889
        - I stole some.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.925
     - Well sausage too.

33:15.694 --> 33:16.393
         - Maybe later.

33:16.395 --> 33:20.364
 - All right, well I'm
 gonna go piss on some shit.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.571
      (gentle piano music)

33:29.041 --> 33:31.908
         (axe chops)

33:32.544 --> 33:33.810
             - Uh.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.114
             Ah.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.620
            Morning.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.258
            (sighs)

33:49.895 --> 33:52.496
    Wonder what time it is.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.238
              Hmm.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.210
            (moans)

34:08.213 --> 34:09.545
          You know,

34:10.282 --> 34:15.185
      we could stay in bed
      and cuddle and talk.

34:18.489 --> 34:19.755
             Molly?

34:20.826 --> 34:22.092
             Molly?

34:23.062 --> 34:25.462
            (sighs)

34:29.201 --> 34:32.101
      (heavy footsteps)

34:32.103 --> 34:34.871
           (slurping)

34:36.341 --> 34:39.609
        (water sloshing)

34:49.554 --> 34:51.788
  What's the wifi password?

34:56.762 --> 34:58.028
             What?

34:59.164 --> 35:01.098
          (sighs)
          Whatever.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.813
       (insects chirping)

35:41.473 --> 35:43.073
        (dramatic tone)

35:43.075 --> 35:43.840
             - Hey!

35:43.842 --> 35:45.675
      (heavy breathing)

35:45.677 --> 35:47.210
       You gotta watch
       yourself out here.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.580
   - I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't
   realize what I was doing.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.717
   - It's easy to get carried
   away out here okay?

35:54.219 --> 35:55.452
            - Yeah.

35:55.521 --> 35:58.788
     - You need to be more
     careful from now on.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.424
     These woods will
     play tricks on you.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.694
          - Thank you,

36:05.197 --> 36:06.630
         for saving me.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.800
       (insects chirping)

36:14.006 --> 36:16.139
    - Do you have any kings?

36:16.141 --> 36:17.374
            - Yeah.

36:18.143 --> 36:21.378
    Ah, do you have a jack?

36:21.380 --> 36:24.181
     - I do actually
     where'd you put it?

36:24.183 --> 36:26.883
  Okay, I'm blind so. (laughs)

36:26.885 --> 36:27.617
            - Okay.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.418
         (door clicks)

36:28.420 --> 36:30.754
      - [Lance] Hey Molly?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.225
 - Hey Lance how's it goin'?

36:35.227 --> 36:37.027
     - The old man is
     lucid at the moment

36:37.029 --> 36:38.361
  if you wanna give it a shot.

36:38.363 --> 36:39.496
       No guarantee how
       long it will last.

36:39.498 --> 36:42.966
 - Oh great, thank you so much,
 we'll head right over, okay?

36:42.968 --> 36:44.301
           Thank you.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.575
       (foreboding music)

37:02.020 --> 37:05.889
     (footsteps crunching)

37:10.195 --> 37:11.461
             Boys!

37:32.784 --> 37:34.451
      We're ready to roll.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.021
     (footsteps crunching)

37:38.023 --> 37:40.090
  - Molly, Molly, hey, hey!

37:40.726 --> 37:43.793
  We were, we were just, we...

37:46.498 --> 37:47.397
         Did you know?

37:47.399 --> 37:49.399
      - Russell I don't
      care who you fuck

37:49.401 --> 37:50.900
      and if you try to
      justify it to me,

37:50.902 --> 37:53.303
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.875
    - Good talk, good talk.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.780
     (footsteps crunching)

38:03.782 --> 38:04.948
      - Mr. Mahoney I just
      wanna let you know

38:04.950 --> 38:06.883
     you can stop the
     interview at any time.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.151
 Take all the breaks you need.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.085
   - That's very kind of you.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.855
     I don't think
     that'll be necessary.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.057
 I'm a lot tougher than I look.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.025
        - (laughs) Okay.

38:15.027 --> 38:18.061
     I'm gonna let Wendy
     take it from here.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.864
      - Hi Mr. Mahoney,
      how you doin' today?

38:20.866 --> 38:25.168
 - Darlin' I'm doin' decades
 later with you in front of me.

38:25.170 --> 38:25.669
            (laughs)

38:25.671 --> 38:27.270
 You know if I was any younger,

38:27.272 --> 38:29.906
     I'd let you turn me
     down a few times.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.775
           (laughing)

38:31.777 --> 38:32.642
     - I like him. (laughs)

38:32.644 --> 38:33.610
   - [Molly] I'm sure you do.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.379
     - Ah, where were y'all
     when I was 20, huh?

38:36.381 --> 38:37.547
     Ah, nevermind don't
     even answer that,

38:37.549 --> 38:41.251
 let's get on with it before
 you break my heart some more.

38:41.253 --> 38:41.885
         (Wendy laughs)

38:41.887 --> 38:44.587
 - [Molly] All right, picture's
 up, let's roll camera.

38:44.589 --> 38:45.955
        - Camera speeds.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.124
   - [Michael] Samuel Mahoney
   interview, take one.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.260
      (clapperboard snaps)

38:50.262 --> 38:53.196
     - [Molly] All right
     everybody settle in

38:54.366 --> 38:55.832
         and action.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.269
          (eerie tone)

39:03.008 --> 39:06.242
 - I just have one more
 question for you Mr. Mahoney.

39:06.244 --> 39:07.644
 - [Samuel] And what's that?

39:07.646 --> 39:10.046
    - What happened in the
    past is one of the most

39:10.048 --> 39:11.881
mysterious tragedies in history.

39:11.883 --> 39:15.318
   What was it like walking
   into that awful aftermath?

39:15.320 --> 39:17.320
Did that affect you in any way?

39:17.322 --> 39:19.222
         If so, how?

39:24.496 --> 39:26.730
    - Short answer to that.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.167
     Unfortunately, yes.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.405
            (sighs)

39:37.676 --> 39:40.276
        What I witnessed
        up on that pass,

39:40.278 --> 39:43.346
    (mournful music)
    I was not prepared for.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.617
        The impact of it
        changed my life.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.554
         My wife Cathy,

39:53.158 --> 39:55.558
 she was the light of my life.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.929
            (sighs)

39:59.931 --> 40:02.565
  She deserved better than me.

40:02.634 --> 40:06.636
 I wouldn't be sitting here
 today if it wasn't for her.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.438
         Her strength.

40:11.410 --> 40:13.910
But when Lance was coming along,

40:15.080 --> 40:19.215
 she, she gave me an ultimatum.

40:21.586 --> 40:26.923
 She couldn't take it
 anymore and she said to me,

40:28.326 --> 40:30.026
            (sighs)

40:30.028 --> 40:36.166
   she said, "Samuel Mahoney,
   you are acting like you

40:36.535 --> 40:39.536
       "are the one that
       died on that pass.

40:41.406 --> 40:45.508
      "And if you continue
      to let life go by

40:46.878 --> 40:48.711
    "I'm gonna go with it."

40:52.818 --> 40:54.918
    And she wasn't bluffing.

40:55.921 --> 40:57.287
          She left.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.459
            (sighs)

41:02.527 --> 41:05.395
      Well we didn't speak
      for a long time,

41:06.364 --> 41:08.331
      'til Lance was born.

41:12.103 --> 41:15.538
      And when I held that
      baby in my arms,

41:19.010 --> 41:25.048
      I remembered how
      precious life is.

41:29.688 --> 41:34.958
   And I begged her, I begged
   her with all my heart

41:35.927 --> 41:37.427
         to come back.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.232
    And I loved that woman.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.069
     I loved that woman.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.144
        (clears throat)

41:55.146 --> 41:57.714
     But it wasn't enough.

42:03.488 --> 42:04.821
           - And cut.

42:06.591 --> 42:10.393
- So, I'm up in this watchtower

42:10.395 --> 42:13.663
and I am stoned out of my gourd

42:13.665 --> 42:18.301
    and this bear is hauling
    ass up the ladder

42:18.303 --> 42:21.337
      like a sailor with
      his hand up a skirt.

42:21.339 --> 42:22.038
           (laughing)

42:22.040 --> 42:25.341
  And I'm up there and I'm not
  about to wait to find out

42:25.343 --> 42:29.012
   if that bear is smart
   enough to open that latch.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.313
           (laughing)

42:30.315 --> 42:31.180
    - So then what'd you do?

42:31.182 --> 42:33.850
     - I have jumped my
     ass out the window,

42:33.852 --> 42:36.219
     thank god there
     was a tree outside.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.153
           (laughing)

42:37.155 --> 42:38.121
     - Weren't you scared?

42:38.123 --> 42:41.190
     - Hell ye, darlin' let
     me tell you somethin'

42:41.192 --> 42:45.695
  there is a reason they
  give rangers brown pants.

42:45.697 --> 42:46.829
           (laughing)

42:46.831 --> 42:49.532
     - You are the coolest
     old man I've ever met.

42:49.534 --> 42:51.301
     - Hmm, tell him that.

42:51.303 --> 42:52.936
       - For fuck's sake.

42:52.938 --> 42:54.137
            - Noah!

42:56.474 --> 42:57.640
            - What?

43:00.178 --> 43:03.913
  - You guys don't believe
  this shit do you, it's...

43:03.915 --> 43:05.281
          It's a joke.

43:05.350 --> 43:06.583
    - Kid If I ever talked
    to my old man like that

43:06.585 --> 43:09.385
     when I was your age
     I got my ass beat.

43:09.387 --> 43:09.919
            - Yeah?

43:09.921 --> 43:12.355
     Well look how great
     you turned out.

43:12.357 --> 43:13.456
            - Noah!

43:13.458 --> 43:14.691
            Manners.

43:15.293 --> 43:18.661
   - No, it's all right, just
   kinda reminds me of me

43:18.663 --> 43:19.462
     when I was his age.

43:19.464 --> 43:20.830
- Well that's a fuckin' insult.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.465
      - Noah! (hand thuds)

43:22.467 --> 43:24.801
         Leave, now!

43:28.440 --> 43:32.008
     - If you'll excuse me,
     I have chores to do.

43:40.585 --> 43:42.785
  - (clears throat) I'm sorry.

43:42.954 --> 43:48.458
 In this household, we believe
 in discipline, not disrespect.

43:49.094 --> 43:50.026
         My apologies.

43:50.028 --> 43:54.697
    - My old man always said
    that needed a firm hand

43:54.699 --> 43:56.966
 when things got out of order.

43:57.469 --> 43:59.435
    Nah, Noah's a good kid.

43:59.437 --> 44:04.240
 Poor Lance, when his wife died
 they moved in with me and,

44:05.343 --> 44:08.678
    just kinda been a tough
    transition, you know?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.246
        He's all right.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.016
         (Molly sighs)

44:13.018 --> 44:16.786
 - Well I just wanna thank
 you both so much for today.

44:16.788 --> 44:21.457
  The footage we got has truly
  surpassed our expectations.

44:21.459 --> 44:23.092
     - That's fantastic.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.862
     If you need anything
     else just let us know.

44:25.864 --> 44:27.897
     - Well we're going to
     compile the footage

44:27.899 --> 44:30.733
    with the interviews from
    the victims' families.

44:30.735 --> 44:33.069
 I've been trying to find
 footage of the actual incident

44:33.071 --> 44:36.205
      but it's been really
      hard to come by.

44:36.207 --> 44:37.507
         - Footage huh?

44:37.509 --> 44:38.775
     You want some footage.

44:38.777 --> 44:40.009
             - Dad.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.578
         - I have some.

44:43.448 --> 44:44.681
            - What?

44:44.749 --> 44:47.316
  - Yeah, I had my camera with
  me when I found the bodies.

44:47.318 --> 44:48.551
   - Are you fuckin' serious?

44:48.553 --> 44:49.385
          (hand slaps)

44:49.387 --> 44:50.053
          Shit, sorry.

44:50.055 --> 44:51.487
     - I don't think
     that's a good idea.

44:51.489 --> 44:56.392
 - I transferred it to VHS
 when it started deteriorating

44:56.394 --> 45:00.063
      and I think it's all
      right, but I got it.

45:00.765 --> 45:05.301
       - (laughs) I mean,
       can we watch it?

45:06.738 --> 45:08.371
  - Well of course you can,
  why the hell do you think

45:08.373 --> 45:10.406
     I'm sittin' here
     telling you all this?

45:10.408 --> 45:11.107
           (laughing)

45:11.109 --> 45:13.376
  - Just really makes no
  sense, an old video tape,

45:13.378 --> 45:14.510
 there's really nothin' on it.

45:14.512 --> 45:17.180
         (loud thud)

45:18.383 --> 45:21.584
        (ominous music)

45:23.922 --> 45:25.188
             - Why?

45:26.624 --> 45:27.857
              Huh?

45:28.993 --> 45:32.862
       You think it'll
       trigger something?

45:32.931 --> 45:36.099
     You want me to
     avoid it don't you?

45:38.236 --> 45:41.804
   These kids here, they're
   offering me an opportunity

45:41.806 --> 45:46.943
 to make sense out of some
 things, out of what happened.

45:47.312 --> 45:50.046
  And maybe even bring
  some peace to some people

45:50.048 --> 45:52.248
    who are still wonderin'.

45:56.254 --> 46:00.223
   Nah, I can't pass a chance
   up like that, can I?

46:13.972 --> 46:17.173
    Come on in here into the
    room and grab a seat.

46:17.175 --> 46:19.275
  - [Becca] No, no not you.

46:19.277 --> 46:19.942
        - [Hannah] What?

46:19.944 --> 46:21.677
      - I don't know
      what's on that tape.

46:21.679 --> 46:22.612
         - Okay, so?

46:22.614 --> 46:24.247
  - So head back to the cabin.

46:24.249 --> 46:27.049
     - No, Molly said that
     I'm part of the crew

46:27.051 --> 46:28.985
     and that I should
     know all the details.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.521
       - Well Molly's not
       in charge of you.

46:31.523 --> 46:33.823
     - Hey just let us
     watch it first, okay.

46:33.825 --> 46:35.391
      We don't know what
      we're walking in on.

46:35.393 --> 46:38.694
     You can watch whatever
     we pull for the doc.

46:40.265 --> 46:42.565
    - Okay, you hypocrites.

46:49.741 --> 46:52.675
          (door thuds)

47:04.155 --> 47:06.322
     - You sure about this?

47:06.324 --> 47:07.557
            - Yeah.

47:08.526 --> 47:11.727
        (ominous music)

48:05.149 --> 48:07.550
            (sighs)

48:46.357 --> 48:49.625
        (exhales deeply)

49:14.485 --> 49:18.154
     (footsteps tapping)

49:18.990 --> 49:20.990
           (knocking)

49:20.992 --> 49:23.392
            (sighs)

49:27.799 --> 49:28.698
         - [Noah] Hey.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.000
   - [Hannah] Hey, what's up?

49:31.235 --> 49:32.969
    - [Noah] Can I come in?

49:33.438 --> 49:34.971
        - [Hannah] Sure.

49:34.973 --> 49:35.738
         (door clicks)

49:35.740 --> 49:38.808
       - [Noah] I saw you
       leave the house,

49:39.577 --> 49:42.878
  you ah, you looked upset.

49:43.681 --> 49:45.948
     - (laughs) Well yeah,

49:45.950 --> 49:49.085
      'cause of my fuckin'
      bitch of a sister.

49:52.790 --> 49:54.590
     - [Noah] Want a drink?

49:55.326 --> 49:56.559
            - Yeah.

50:01.733 --> 50:05.668
     (cupboard door clicks)

50:09.040 --> 50:12.241
        (ominous music)

50:59.457 --> 51:02.825
      (heavy breathing)

51:11.269 --> 51:14.904
     - (exhales) You know,
     I've had tequila

51:14.906 --> 51:16.806
     one other time before.

51:17.408 --> 51:18.074
           - Oh yeah?

51:18.076 --> 51:21.777
    - Yeah, at church camp.

51:21.779 --> 51:22.978
          - Really?

51:22.980 --> 51:23.813
        - [Hannah] Yep.

51:23.815 --> 51:26.515
           (laughing)

51:29.754 --> 51:32.421
Your house seems pretty intense.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.992
  - (sighs) I hate it here.

51:39.063 --> 51:41.230
   Never wanted to move here.

51:48.873 --> 51:51.640
     - Did your mom die?

51:54.078 --> 51:55.244
            - Yeah.

51:59.016 --> 52:00.216
             - Oh.

52:02.353 --> 52:03.719
        That's a bummer.

52:04.856 --> 52:06.088
            - Yeah.

52:07.525 --> 52:08.858
           It sucked.

52:11.129 --> 52:15.164
    When she died, I didn't
    have anything left.

52:17.435 --> 52:21.837
  I knew I'd get stuck here
  in the fuckin' woods.

52:24.075 --> 52:26.275
  I'm gonna die here you know?

52:27.545 --> 52:32.181
     - That's, that's a
     depressing thought.

52:32.183 --> 52:33.549
          - It's true.

52:35.019 --> 52:38.387
    You think I like livin'
    in the fuckin' woods?

52:41.459 --> 52:45.161
     I'm 19 years old and I
     drink a handle a week.

52:47.031 --> 52:52.101
     Once you live here,
     you stay here forever.

52:54.672 --> 52:58.874
   - I mean, you could leave,
   like, you can come with us

52:58.876 --> 52:59.708
        if you have to.

52:59.710 --> 53:01.243
          - Fuck that.

53:02.079 --> 53:03.979
     My dad would kill me.

53:04.182 --> 53:06.982
If he didn't, my grandpa would.

53:07.218 --> 53:10.052
     - Okay so he's scary,
     but like. (laughs)

53:10.054 --> 53:12.721
      - No you should
      be scared of him!

53:14.258 --> 53:15.658
         Don't you see?

53:17.195 --> 53:18.527
           He's evil.

53:26.170 --> 53:29.405
        (ominous music)

53:45.556 --> 53:49.225
     (leather crunching)

54:00.171 --> 54:02.838
          (gasping)

54:07.144 --> 54:08.677
         - Mr. Mahoney.

54:08.679 --> 54:10.312
       Are you all right?

54:10.948 --> 54:12.214
             - Dad.

54:12.917 --> 54:13.716
     Dad, th, that's it!

54:13.718 --> 54:15.985
    Turn off the tape, turn
    it off, turn it off!

54:15.987 --> 54:17.319
 Dad look at me, it's Lance.

54:17.321 --> 54:18.053
      (hysterical screams)

54:18.055 --> 54:19.321
     It's okay, it's okay.
     - Get out of my house!

54:19.323 --> 54:20.689
     - No dad look at me!
     - Get him the fuck out

54:20.691 --> 54:22.358
 of my house!
 - You're okay, you're okay.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.392
         (screaming)
         Look at me,

54:23.394 --> 54:24.793
    it's Lance, it's Lance.

54:24.795 --> 54:25.394
          You're fine.

54:25.396 --> 54:27.329
     I'm right here, you're
     safe, we're home.

54:27.331 --> 54:28.564
          - Cathy!
          - It's okay.

54:28.566 --> 54:29.265
             No.

54:29.267 --> 54:30.733
        - Cathy, Cathy!

54:32.103 --> 54:32.835
         - Mr. Mahoney.

54:32.837 --> 54:36.672
    - Cathy (heavy panting)

54:36.674 --> 54:37.940
             Cathy.

54:37.942 --> 54:41.610
     You said you would
     never leave me again.

54:41.612 --> 54:47.616
 - (sighs) After my grandpa
 saw the bodies, just snapped.

54:50.488 --> 54:51.954
           Went nuts.

54:54.992 --> 54:56.992
    He did terrible things.

55:00.531 --> 55:01.897
          - Like what?

55:08.439 --> 55:09.305
    - Why did you leave me?

55:09.307 --> 55:11.106
      You promised you
      would never le...

55:11.108 --> 55:14.310
        (dramatic tone)

55:18.382 --> 55:21.950
       (heavy drum music)

55:42.473 --> 55:43.238
            (crying)

55:43.240 --> 55:44.306
        - [Russell] Oh.

55:44.308 --> 55:46.208
     - Okay, move, move.

55:46.277 --> 55:47.743
     Dad right here, right
     here, it's okay.

55:47.745 --> 55:51.780
    You're okay, you're
    okay, come on, come on.

55:51.782 --> 55:52.648
            Come on.

55:52.650 --> 55:54.850
          (sobbing)

55:54.852 --> 55:56.118
      Get them outta here.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.319
     - Come on, come on,
     - Let's go.

55:57.321 --> 55:59.088
      come on, come on.

55:59.090 --> 56:00.122
         - Go.
         - You're fine.

56:00.124 --> 56:00.889
        (heavy sobbing)

56:00.891 --> 56:04.660
     Shh, shh, shh,
     shh, shh, shh, shh.

56:04.662 --> 56:05.461
           It's okay.

56:05.463 --> 56:08.664
        (heavy sobbing)

56:08.666 --> 56:09.998
           It's okay.

56:14.839 --> 56:18.507
     (footsteps tapping)

56:22.413 --> 56:26.081
     (fridge door thuds)

56:27.451 --> 56:29.184
     - So what happened?

56:29.186 --> 56:31.520
  - [Becca] Not now Hannah.

56:31.655 --> 56:36.425
    - Well, least we got
    what we came for, right?

56:36.427 --> 56:37.292
  - Maybe we should go to bed.

56:37.294 --> 56:39.228
     We can pack everything
     up in the morning.

56:39.230 --> 56:42.698
      - You guys, we could
      pack everything up.

56:42.900 --> 56:47.169
  Or we could finish the tape,
  totally up to you guys.

56:47.705 --> 56:50.205
        (Russell laughs)

56:50.207 --> 56:52.674
    - What the fuck Michael?

56:52.676 --> 56:53.375
            - What?

56:53.377 --> 56:55.043
        - You stole it?

56:55.045 --> 56:56.645
     - It was sitting right
     there, it was easy.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.781
      - Molly look, we
      can give it back.

56:58.783 --> 56:59.448
        - Yeah, shut up!

56:59.450 --> 57:01.817
 You can't just steal things
 out of people's homes,

57:01.819 --> 57:03.118
        are you insane?

57:03.120 --> 57:05.254
 - I thought you'd be happy.

57:05.790 --> 57:07.089
    - We're not watching it.

57:07.091 --> 57:08.090
         - Oh come on.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.491
         - [Molly] No!

57:12.196 --> 57:13.429
             No.

57:18.769 --> 57:19.301
            (sighs)

57:19.303 --> 57:20.569
     You fucking beautiful

57:20.571 --> 57:24.139
        son of a bitch.
        (loud slap)

57:24.141 --> 57:25.474
           - Shotgun!

57:30.948 --> 57:32.448
 - Can someone get the lights?

57:32.450 --> 57:35.017
    - [Russell] God dammit.

57:39.557 --> 57:43.425
     (light switch clicks)

57:48.199 --> 57:50.032
 - [Molly] The hell is this?

57:50.034 --> 57:52.501
- [Wendy] That's, that's Cathy.

57:53.337 --> 57:55.137
    - [Hannah] Who's Cathy?

57:56.006 --> 57:57.606
     - [Molly] His wife.

58:01.412 --> 58:04.613
        (ominous music)

58:30.908 --> 58:34.109
        (dramatic tone)

59:02.039 --> 59:04.039
      - What is she doing?

59:04.775 --> 59:07.876
     (suspenseful music)

59:07.878 --> 59:10.312
         (screaming)

59:10.314 --> 59:12.047
        - What the fuck?

59:17.087 --> 59:18.320
            G, guys.

59:19.823 --> 59:23.725
    That's right here, look.

59:25.663 --> 59:28.530
    - We should just leave.
    - What?

59:31.302 --> 59:34.503
        (ominous music)

59:46.850 --> 59:48.383
       - [Wendy] Open it!

59:51.855 --> 59:55.924
   - Dearest Samuel, I regret
   that I must do this.

59:55.926 --> 59:59.461
     I just cannot go on
     like this any longer.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.396
        You are so cold.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:02.731
           I'm sorry.

01:00:03.567 --> 01:00:05.534
       I love you, Cathy.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:08.770
             Shit.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.105
          - Oh god.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:26.922
         (screaming)

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:30.192
        (dramatic music)

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.299
            - Guys.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.434
             Becca.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.441
         Is that me?

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:48.677
  - Is this some kind of joke?

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:49.878
          - No I...

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:51.613
 - Do you think this is funny?

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:52.247
             - No!

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:53.281
      - [Becca] Do you?

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.516
             - No!

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.758
      - [Russell] What
      the hell is that?

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.596
         - Holy Jesus.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.214
   - [Russell] What the shit?

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:29.818
        (dramatic music)

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:36.925
      - [Wendy] Oh my god!

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:48.970
            (gasps)

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:50.706
         (screaming)

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.507
     - Okay, stop the tape!

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.643
           (coughing)

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:56.578
       What is happening?

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.413
     Who are these people?

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.816
    - I don't, I don't know.

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.284
  - Hannah, go to our room.

01:02:02.286 --> 01:02:04.920
          - What, why?
          - Right now!

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:10.225
     This has to be some
     kind of a joke, right?

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.893
 You guys are fucking with me.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.497
    - Nobody's fucking with
    you Becca, that's us.

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:19.101
    - This has to be some
    kind of a joke, a prank.

01:02:19.103 --> 01:02:21.269
 Like the time you pretended
 to break your neck

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.071
    or when you were
    filming Russell swimming

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:25.140
   and he pretended to drown.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:26.975
   You're trying to scare me?

01:02:26.977 --> 01:02:27.976
- No one is trying to scare you,

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:31.646
   we have no fucking idea
   what's going on right now!

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:37.953
       (heavy drum music)

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:56.304
            (gasps)

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:57.539
             - No.

01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:03.445
         - Oh come on!

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:10.519
         God dammit!

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.589
         What the fuck?

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:20.195
            (gasps)

01:03:33.877 --> 01:03:39.114
          (door thuds)
          (yelps)

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:47.656
     (heavy footsteps thud)

01:03:58.235 --> 01:03:59.401
           (knocking)

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:01.102
         - Knock knock.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:06.875
  Just thought I would come
  up here and tell y'all

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.511
if you're thinkin' of packin' up

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.781
and leaving tomorrow you can't.

01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:17.252
      The storm is really
      comin' down outside.

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.788
  The roads are washed out.

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:23.992
       What's the matter?

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.627
         (crunching)

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.295
      Y'all up to no good?

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:33.168
              Hmm.

01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:34.502
          Oh I see.

01:04:35.806 --> 01:04:37.072
             I see.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:41.877
  You know, where I come from,

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:47.282
       if somebody houses
       you and feeds you

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:51.853
     and gives you there
     time and trust.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.091
     You really should
     respect their wishes!

01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:57.459
        Don't you think?

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:03.765
    - Why don't you tell us,
    what the fuck this is?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.370
 - You still like girls do ya?

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:13.575
           (whistles)

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:15.577

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:37.331
        - Oh hi Michael.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:38.866
        - Are you okay?

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:42.570
    - We're fine, would you
    like to pray with us?

01:15:45.842 --> 01:15:46.841
        - Pray with who?

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.110
 - (laughs) You're so funny.

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:53.548
  Hail Mary, full of grace,
  our lord is with thee.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:54.982
  Blessed art thou among women

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:58.819
    and blessed is the food
    of thy womb, Jesus.

01:16:00.356 --> 01:16:01.656
          - Hungry?

01:16:02.525 --> 01:16:04.358
        - I'm starving.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.663
            Mm, mm.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.547
       (thunder rumbling)

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:27.882
           - Michael.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.184
             Russ.

01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:33.921
         (screaming)

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:35.756
         Hey, it's me!

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.991
            It's me.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.828
         Hey! (screams)

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.029
          Fu, wait!

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:44.832
         (screaming)

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:46.067
            It's me!

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.570
         Hey, it's me.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.843
       God, are you okay?

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:58.212
        - I don't know.

01:16:58.214 --> 01:16:59.680
   What the fuck is going on?

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:02.116
      (heavy breathing)

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:02.917
      - Where is everyone?

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:04.852
- I, I don't know, I don't know.

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:08.022
    - We have to find them,
    okay, let's go, okay?

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:09.790
            - Okay.
            - Fuck.

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:29.276
           (crunches)

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:30.711
             - Mm.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:31.779
      - Do you like it?

01:17:31.781 --> 01:17:33.381
       - They're so good.

01:17:33.583 --> 01:17:35.716
 Would you like to try some?

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:40.855
     - Yes, I do want one.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.441
            - Guys?

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.077
            (gasps)

01:18:03.079 --> 01:18:05.846
           (retching)

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:09.216
             - Oh.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.352
           - Hey Mol.

01:18:12.822 --> 01:18:14.221
         What's wrong?

01:18:15.358 --> 01:18:18.492
    I'm just trying to
    take care of my people.

01:18:21.831 --> 01:18:23.898
          (squelching)

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:26.300
            (gasps)

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:32.073
        - You want some?

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:36.310
        It's cool ranch.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:44.752
             Ha ha.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.620
            (gasps)

01:18:46.622 --> 01:18:47.888
             - Oh.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:51.225
- Mol relax, everything's fine.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.762
Hannah's here and we found food.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:56.797
     - Hannah's dead Becca!

01:19:02.538 --> 01:19:03.804
             - No!

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:09.643
       You, you did this!

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:12.146
        (dramatic music)

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:14.014
    - No Becca!
    - She was my everything,

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.716
   you took her away from me!

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:17.885
- Becca I love Hannah! (crying)

01:19:17.887 --> 01:19:20.855
     - You brought us
     here, you killed her!

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.189
       (flesh squelching)

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:25.659
      (heavy breathing)

01:19:34.837 --> 01:19:37.505
        - Oh. (retches)

01:19:37.507 --> 01:19:40.007
            (crying)

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:49.950
           - Michael.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:54.588
       - This is my body,
       which is for you.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:59.260
Take, eat in remembrance of me.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:03.030
     - Michael why are you
     doing this? (cries)

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:05.132
    No, no, no, no, no, oh.

01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:08.969
        - She needed me.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.807
       I had to help her.

01:20:18.247 --> 01:20:20.447
        Do you need me?

01:20:23.119 --> 01:20:27.054
      - No, no Michael
      I don't need you.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.691
     - I love you Molly.

01:20:34.363 --> 01:20:39.800
      - Michael. (sobbing)

01:20:44.574 --> 01:20:46.407
            (sniffs)

01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:49.844
      (heavy breathing)

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:09.797
     - Where the fuck have
     you rug munchers been?

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:12.700
         - Ru, Russell?

01:21:13.169 --> 01:21:14.001
           Oh my god!

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:15.669
            - Oh.
            - Russ.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:17.605
      Fuck Russ, I thought
      you were dead.

01:21:17.607 --> 01:21:19.440
          - Oh my god.

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:20.241
          - Me too.

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:23.677
      (heavy breathing)

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.412
     Did you find Michael?

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:34.054
         Is he okay?

01:21:42.164 --> 01:21:46.867
 Him and Rebecca started going
 at each other like Dahmer.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:48.669
      I didn't wanna stick
      around and find out

01:21:48.671 --> 01:21:50.504
     that shit was
     gonna happen to me.

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:53.874
    I ran, I'm sorry, Molly,
    I ran like a bitch.

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:55.075
      - It's okay.
      - It's okay Russ.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:56.911
     - [Russell] I'm sorry.

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:04.852
     - We're only a couple
     miles from town right?

01:22:04.854 --> 01:22:07.922
          We gotta go.

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:09.690
     Come on, we gotta go.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:12.760
           (whimpers)

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:13.994
            - What?

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:17.298
            - Okay.

01:22:19.135 --> 01:22:20.367
            Alright.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.573
      - Woo, blergh, bleh!

01:22:29.245 --> 01:22:31.412
    - The fuck's the matter
    with you princess?

01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:33.647
  - I thought I felt a spider.

01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:34.381
        It... (screams)

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:35.683
       - What's wrong?
       - It's in my hair!

01:22:35.685 --> 01:22:37.785
      It's in my hair,
      what is going on?

01:22:37.787 --> 01:22:40.454
      Ew, get them off
      me, get them off me!

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:41.789
        (dramatic music)
        - Wendy stop!

01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:45.626
   - Oh, oh it feels so good.
   (squelching)

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.361
     - What are you doing?

01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:48.329
         Stop!
         - We gotta go!

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:49.730
  - No, we can't leave her!

01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:52.132
         - Gotta go!
         - Wendy!

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:56.103
      (heavy breathing)

01:23:03.379 --> 01:23:09.416
       - Oh, my god, we
       made it. (gasping)

01:23:13.923 --> 01:23:17.791
     - We're, we're
     almost there Molly.

01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:21.729
            (grunts)

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.133
        - Are you okay?

01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:27.634
         - I'm fine.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:29.470
     - Fuck, you've
     lost so much blood.

01:23:29.472 --> 01:23:30.704
 We've gotta get you help okay?

01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:33.173
     - Get off me I'm fine!

01:23:33.376 --> 01:23:35.175
       Fucking handle it.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:37.945
             - Heh.

01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:41.181
            (laughs)

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.656
      You'll handle it!

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:54.561
- Oh you fucking bitch. (laughs)

01:23:58.768 --> 01:24:01.168
            (crying)

01:24:07.243 --> 01:24:09.376
          - Oh my god.

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:17.651
     They're dead, they're
     all fucking dead!

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:23.590
And we left them, we left them.

01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:29.063
           Oh my god.

01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:35.369
     - They're gone Molly.

01:24:36.272 --> 01:24:38.072
         They're gone.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:41.542
      (heavy breathing)

01:24:47.116 --> 01:24:48.015
        - What's wrong?

01:24:48.017 --> 01:24:52.386
      - Nothing it's just,
      happens sometimes.

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:56.557
     - What, what happens?

01:24:57.093 --> 01:25:02.796
  - I can't breath. (gasps)

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:05.466
        (ominous music)

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:42.302
           (whimpers)

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:47.407
         - I get it.

01:25:49.445 --> 01:25:50.644
         I understand.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.179
        - What? (gasps)

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:55.115
  - It's happening to you too.

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:55.716
            - What?

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:58.819
      (heavy breathing)

01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:01.455
     Just give me a second.

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:04.158
          (gasping)

01:26:09.365 --> 01:26:11.698
           (grunting)

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.568
         (screaming)

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:15.836
             Russ!

01:26:16.906 --> 01:26:17.638
            It's me!

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:20.407
           (grunting)

01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:31.285
          (sobbing)

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:34.755
      (rain spattering)

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:13.393
     (suspenseful music)

01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:33.780
- It's a little ironic actually.

01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:41.188
     Hmm, after that first
     incident at the pass

01:27:43.359 --> 01:27:45.759
            (sighs)

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.296
       I became obsessed.

01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:55.002
          So obsessed,

01:27:57.106 --> 01:28:00.841
    and I lost my marriage.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:04.878
Lost my relationship with my son

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:09.883
      but I needed to
      know the answers.

01:28:12.921 --> 01:28:16.723
       (sighs) After this
       last incident,

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:23.163
  there's one thing that I
  realize I don't take lightly

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:28.335
 and that's the responsibility

01:28:30.439 --> 01:28:34.808
     of knowing that I'm
     the one that remains.

01:28:37.146 --> 01:28:38.578
     - Great that's a cut.

01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:40.113
      Go ahead and cut it.

01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:42.449
     Thank you, so much.

01:28:42.451 --> 01:28:46.353
   Off the record, these
   kids didn't show any signs

01:28:46.355 --> 01:28:47.988
       of mental illness?

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:54.394
         - No, none.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:57.431
They all seemed fit as a fiddle.

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:01.835
     Wouldn't you agree?

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:03.870
        - I would, yeah.

01:29:04.573 --> 01:29:06.239
      They were good kids.

01:29:06.375 --> 01:29:08.909
      It's a shame what
      happened to 'em.

01:29:08.911 --> 01:29:11.311
     - It sounds similar to
     the Tunguska incident

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:12.312
     in Russia, years ago.

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:15.649
    Where ultimately, people
    blamed nuclear testing.

01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:18.385
  With the recent discovery
  of the military testing here

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:20.754
     in the 50s and 60s I
     think one could assume

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:23.090
    that maybe these kids
    suffered the same fate.

01:29:23.092 --> 01:29:26.293
     Do you have any
     thoughts on that, or?

01:29:37.406 --> 01:29:40.307
       Okay, well thank
       you for your time.

01:29:40.309 --> 01:29:42.809
 I appreciate it, I have to go.

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:43.777
 I've got some research to do.

01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:45.412
     Trying to find some
     crime scene photos

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:47.681
 but they're tough to come by.

01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:51.184
    - Well, I might be able
    to help you out in that.

01:29:51.253 --> 01:29:54.888
     I have some footage
     that I shot myself

01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.257
of the crime scene at the time.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:29:59.659
      I could show you?

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:02.763
 - Dad, it's not gonna help.

01:30:03.165 --> 01:30:04.731
      - I mean, yeah,
      that would be great,

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.867
 if it's not too much trouble.

01:30:06.869 --> 01:30:10.504
    - No, no trouble at all.

01:30:10.639 --> 01:30:13.640
  - Great, great, all right
  let's wrap this up guys.

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:14.608
      Let's get moving.

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:15.942
           Thank you.

01:30:18.547 --> 01:30:21.748
        (ominous music)

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:52.279
       (mysterious music)

01:32:08.257 --> 01:32:12.125
  ¶ I don't trust my eyes ¶

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:16.229
  ¶ They can't really see ¶

01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:22.102
   ¶ Why do I feel you near ¶

01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.838
      ¶ When there's no
      one next to me ¶

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:27.974
   ¶ No matter where I turn ¶

01:32:27.976 --> 01:32:32.679
  ¶ I can't clear my head ¶

01:32:32.681 --> 01:32:36.182
 ¶ We're running out of time ¶

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:37.951
        ¶ Take my hand ¶

01:32:37.953 --> 01:32:40.654
    ¶ Or I'm already dead ¶

01:32:40.656 --> 01:32:46.426
     ¶ Someone help me ¶

01:32:48.397 --> 01:32:54.134
       ¶ I can't breath ¶

01:32:57.339 --> 01:32:59.039
         ¶ It's close ¶

01:32:59.041 --> 01:33:00.640
          ¶ So close ¶

01:33:00.642 --> 01:33:04.578
¶ Can't hear or see the light ¶

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.746
      ¶ Hold me tight ¶

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:08.582
       ¶ Shut your eyes ¶

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:12.686
 ¶ We're both falling tonight ¶

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:16.590
     ¶ It glows so close ¶

01:33:16.592 --> 01:33:20.894
¶ Can't hear or see the light ¶

01:33:20.896 --> 01:33:22.829
      ¶ Hold me tight ¶

01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:24.698
       ¶ Shut your eyes ¶

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:28.602
 ¶ We're both falling tonight ¶

01:33:28.604 --> 01:33:34.374
     ¶ Someone help me ¶

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:40.880
         ¶ I can't ¶
