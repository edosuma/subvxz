00:50.166 --> 00:54.467
Carry the 2. 7, 11...14.

00:54.533 --> 00:58.500
Okay. Here's what your take will be
for the first month.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.300
Are we partners, or what?

01:01.367 --> 01:05.567
Making extra money appeals to me,
but why sandwiches?

01:05.633 --> 01:08.867
We don't have enough counter space
to make kidney machines.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.633
Are we partners, or what?

01:11.700 --> 01:13.667
It sounds complicated

01:13.734 --> 01:15.967
selling sandwiches at
a construction site.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.000
I don’t know the first thing
about business.

01:18.066 --> 01:19.934
You should ask Dorothy
or Blanche.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.133
At least they'd have some input.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.667
I know. So are we partners?

01:24.767 --> 01:26.433
Okay. How do I look?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.767
Nice outfit. Now go
put some make-up on.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.100
Ma, I'm wearing make-up.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.967
You better eat
by candlelight.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.500
Dorothy, you really
look lovely.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.400
Lovely isn't enough for a date
with Jeffrey the commodore.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.834
A commodore? In the navy?

01:42.900 --> 01:45.834
No, Rose, the singing group.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.133
He's in the middle.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.033
He was on the end
till Lionel Ritchie left.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.000
You've been spending a lot
of time together.

01:53.066 --> 01:57.400
Just when I'd given up
hope of meeting someone,

01:57.467 --> 02:00.066
along came the most gallant,
sophisticated,

02:00.133 --> 02:01.834
charming man I'd met in ages.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.300
I bet he can tie lots of neat knots.

02:06.066 --> 02:07.433
Dorothy, guess who's here.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.233
My date.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.133
Your husband.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.333
I don't have one. Call the police.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.800
Your ex-husband.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.300
I'll call the police.

02:15.367 --> 02:17.500
Hi, everyone.
It's me... Stan.

02:17.567 --> 02:20.400
Dorothy. In the future,

02:20.467 --> 02:24.000
I'd appreciate some advance notice
when you're expecting a gentleman.

02:24.066 --> 02:25.767
I realize this time, it's only Stan,

02:25.834 --> 02:29.967
but next time, it could be
somebody good-looking.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.500
No offense, Stan.

02:31.567 --> 02:34.467
None taken.
Dorothy, could we talk a minute?

02:34.533 --> 02:36.100
Sure, for a minute.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.633
You bring your wife along,

02:37.700 --> 02:40.433
or did she stay home
to clean her toy box?

02:43.133 --> 02:47.734
Ma, don't you remember? I told you,
Stan and Chrissy got a divorce.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.467
I thought you said they got a horse.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.066
I'm 80. You got to enunciate.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.333
Don't get me wrong. Horse, divorce.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.633
I could care less.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.667
I just hate being left
with egg on my face.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.767
All right, Stan. What's wrong?

03:03.834 --> 03:05.600
There's nothing wrong.

03:05.667 --> 03:09.100
Oh, please, Stan.
We were married for 38 years.

03:09.166 --> 03:13.000
You can disguise your bald head,
but you can't hide your emotions.

03:13.066 --> 03:14.300
What's wrong?

03:14.367 --> 03:16.133
I lost it, Dorothy!

03:16.200 --> 03:17.100
(cries)

03:17.166 --> 03:19.867
You never had it, Stanley.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.200
The business!

03:26.900 --> 03:30.700
I don’t know what to do.
22 years of sweat and blood,

03:30.767 --> 03:34.266
and it's all flushed down the toilet
like a snotty ball of Kleenex.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.734
You could always write poetry
for a living.

03:38.867 --> 03:42.100
I'm sorry.
I know how devastated you must be.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.433
I have one question.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.800
I'll still manage
the alimony payments.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.767
That wasn't my question.

03:47.834 --> 03:50.200
Could we possibly
discuss this tomorrow?

03:50.266 --> 03:51.967
I have plans to go out.

03:52.033 --> 03:55.066
Dorothy, please.
I'm afraid to be alone tonight.

03:55.133 --> 03:57.000
My world is crumbling.

03:57.066 --> 03:58.800
I don't know what I'll do.

03:58.867 --> 04:02.066
I do. You'll watch an old <i>Barnaby Jones,</i>

04:02.133 --> 04:04.066
eat 1/2 gallon of rum raisin,

04:04.133 --> 04:06.400
throw up, and fall asleep
in your kimono.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.667
See, Dorothy?
Nobody knows me like you.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.500
Look, I really have plans.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.000
I made dinner reservations at Monty's.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.834
You know Monty's cheers me up.

04:15.900 --> 04:20.100
We could go dancing
if there's no cover charge.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.000
(stammering) I really can't.

04:22.066 --> 04:24.700
Dorothy, please say yes.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.467
I need a friendly shoulder to cry on.

04:27.967 --> 04:29.533
All right. Give me a minute.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.333
Girls, I need a shoulder to cry on.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.233
What did that creep do?

04:36.300 --> 04:40.033
It's not for me, it's for Stan.
He lost the business.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.000
He has to take his mind
off his troubles.

04:42.066 --> 04:43.066
What can we do?

04:43.133 --> 04:46.333
-One of you, go out with him.
-What?

04:48.266 --> 04:52.300
I feel terrible for him,
but I'm not canceling my date.

04:52.367 --> 04:54.033
I won't cancel mine.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.667
-You don't have a date.
-Nobody knows that.

04:58.467 --> 05:02.200
I'd do it, but I'm no good
at listening to people's problems.

05:02.266 --> 05:05.533
You're a grief counselor.
You do it for a living.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.734
I know. But I have the highest
suicide rate in the office.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.000
If you don't want to go out with Stan,
just say so.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.000
I don't want to go out with Stan.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.600
Honey, going out with Stan
is a big favor.

05:20.667 --> 05:21.934
The biggest.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.133
You're asking me to spend my evening
with a man you described

05:25.200 --> 05:30.000
as having the personality of a dial tone
and why,

05:30.066 --> 05:33.500
so you can have a splendid evening
with some dashing naval officer.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.934
I absolutely not. Under no circumstances
will I even entertain the notion.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.500
You can borrow
my cashmere sweater.

05:39.567 --> 05:42.066
-No.
-I will give you outright, outright.

05:42.133 --> 05:45.066
My practically full bottle of
Chanel no. 5.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.367
-Perfume or cologne?
-Cologne.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.266
Forget it.

05:47.333 --> 05:51.433
I'll introduce you to Jeffrey's
naval officer friends.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.233
Some have been at sea
for more than six months.

06:01.934 --> 06:04.800
Make yourself comfortable, honey.
I'll be with you in two minutes.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.467
Use these potatoes.
We're out of tomatoes.

06:11.533 --> 06:13.333
Sophia, I don't think this will work.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.633
We just say it fast...
bacon, lettuce, and potato.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.433
Bacon, lettuce, and potato.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.700
What are you two doing up?
It's after midnight.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.367
We're going into business.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.166
How did she talk you into this, Rose?

06:29.233 --> 06:31.133
Sophia didn't talk me into it.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.400
She said if I had half a brain,
I'd have thought of it myself.

06:36.533 --> 06:38.834
Besides, it'll be fun.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.867
Just like when I was a little girl and
sold Belgian waffles alongside the road.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.266
You had a Belgian waffle stand?

06:47.333 --> 06:49.767
Well, actually, they were English muffins

06:49.834 --> 06:51.433
that I carved little ridges in.

06:52.867 --> 06:56.867
But people bought them.
I was cute and could get away with it.

06:56.934 --> 06:59.400
Don’t worry.
You get cute again when you're 80.

06:59.467 --> 07:01.066
That's how I'm going to
peddle this slop.

07:02.166 --> 07:05.900
-How was your date?
-Glorious. Jeffrey is a dream.

07:05.967 --> 07:09.667
It was worth the guilt
of sticking Blanche with Stan.

07:09.734 --> 07:11.433
Incidentally, is she speaking to me?

07:11.500 --> 07:12.533
She's not home yet.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.500
Oh, poor Blanche.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.633
Oh. When Stan is depressed,

07:16.700 --> 07:19.734
he is the second most
boring man in the world.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.600
Who's the first?

07:20.667 --> 07:22.600
Stan when he's not depressed.

07:24.467 --> 07:27.934
Dorothy's back.
This was the most bizarre evening

07:28.000 --> 07:29.200
I've spent with a man.

07:29.266 --> 07:32.266
Including the time with the jai
alai team from Nicaragua?

07:33.300 --> 07:37.700
She said one man. That was the most
bizarre evening she spent with a team.

07:39.033 --> 07:40.900
What are those sandwiches?
I'm starving.

07:40.967 --> 07:42.867
They're bacon, lettuce,
and potato.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.233
Potato?

07:48.300 --> 07:51.400
Work on it, Rose.
You're not cute anymore.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.767
I thought Stan took you to dinner.

07:54.834 --> 07:55.567
He did.

07:55.633 --> 07:56.834
Let me guess.

07:56.900 --> 08:00.300
You were on your way
to a lovely candlelit dinner,

08:00.367 --> 08:04.400
when Stan spotted a charming
little Pakistani restaurant.

08:04.467 --> 08:05.667
-Indian.
-Indian.

08:05.734 --> 08:08.000
Cocktails consisted of warm beer

08:08.066 --> 08:09.767
in different shaped glasses.

08:09.834 --> 08:13.200
He ordered.
You didn't see the menu.

08:13.266 --> 08:16.266
He paid the bill
and got change back from a 10.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.700
A 5.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.867
Dorothy, that's amazing.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.000
Try me now.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.500
I'll think about what I had for dinner.

08:25.967 --> 08:27.300
Rose, I'm not psychic.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.233
I know Stan's idea of a fun night.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.767
It wasn't so bad.

08:32.834 --> 08:36.800
I enjoyed myself.
I didn't have to impress him.

08:36.867 --> 08:40.700
He knew he couldn't impress me.
We relaxed and had fun.

08:40.767 --> 08:41.900
We're doing it again
tomorrow night.

08:44.533 --> 08:45.333
What?

08:45.400 --> 08:47.500
Well, unless you mind.

08:47.567 --> 08:50.333
I should have asked you.
I'll call him and cancel.

08:50.400 --> 08:54.133
Blanche, don't be ridiculous.
Why should I object?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.834
Well, he was your husband,
Dorothy.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.633
Was, was.
We're divorced, remember?

08:58.700 --> 09:01.700
He left me for a woman
half Blanche's age.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.500
Oh, honey, it's wonderful that
you're going out with Stan tomorrow.

09:08.567 --> 09:11.333
Jeff's taking me to a formal dinner
at the base.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.667
He looks so dashing
in his dress uniform.

09:15.734 --> 09:19.333
Dorothy had a date with a commodore.
Blanche had a date with Stan.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.600
I made bacon, lettuce,
and potato sandwiches.

09:29.934 --> 09:32.734
Step on it, Rose. Sun's coming up.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.567
Why do we have to leave so early?

09:34.633 --> 09:37.066
Because yesterday, we ended up
with a crummy location.

09:37.133 --> 09:40.500
Shouldn't we try to keep
these cold until lunch?

09:40.567 --> 09:43.266
Are you crazy?
We should charge extra for a hot lunch.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.700
What are you two doing up?

09:46.767 --> 09:48.467
Not important. Go back to bed.

09:48.533 --> 09:52.166
It's 5:30 a.m.
It's early to be selling lunch.

09:52.233 --> 09:56.266
We wanted to get there
before Johnny-No-Thumbs.

09:57.467 --> 09:58.767
Johnny-No-Thumbs?

09:58.834 --> 10:02.166
He has several fingers
missing from each hand.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.967
It's remarkable to watch him
make a veal and pepper hero.

10:07.433 --> 10:11.066
You're muscling in on a guy
named Johnny-No-Thumbs?

10:11.133 --> 10:14.233
Are you crazy.
He's probably connected with the mob.

10:14.300 --> 10:17.066
Relax. If they were his friends,
he'd still have his thumbs.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.734
He's a sweet man.

10:20.800 --> 10:22.433
Although the first time
he waved hello,

10:22.500 --> 10:25.400
Sophia misunderstood
and gave him the finger back.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.233
Try to get more sleep.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.066
I can't. I'm upset.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.200
What's wrong?

10:35.266 --> 10:38.233
I won't be seeing Jeffrey anymore.
He's leaving town.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.133
I knew it. When I heard
you were dating a sailor,

10:42.200 --> 10:44.734
I knew there'd be nothing
but heartaches.

10:44.800 --> 10:50.033
Those swabbies drift into port,
park their ditties,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.433
show you some tricks
they learned in the Orient,

10:52.500 --> 10:54.166
then it's "Avast, me hearties",

10:54.233 --> 10:58.700
and they shove off with a serpent tattoo
and your heart as souvenirs.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.734
You've been reading
<i>Treasure Island</i> again.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.266
I know this from my ancestors.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.567
The Vikings were a seafaring
people, you know.

11:07.633 --> 11:11.300
They also wore horns on their head
and metal brassieres.

11:12.433 --> 11:13.900
This is not the same.

11:13.967 --> 11:15.433
So he dumped you, huh?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.700
He didn't dump me.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.066
Jeffrey is being transferred to
the Aleutian islands.

11:20.133 --> 11:23.400
He's going to a top-secret base
where he... he can't have any contact

11:23.467 --> 11:25.567
with the outside world for a year.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.533
-He dumped you?
-Yes.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.500
Dorothy, I'm sorry.

11:30.567 --> 11:34.200
Whenever I think
I've met Mr. Right, I'm wrong.

11:35.233 --> 11:39.033
Because you're not the most
perceptive woman in the world.

11:39.834 --> 11:42.233
Well, what's everybody doing up?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.533
I thought you'd still be sleeping.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.100
We thought you were in your bedroom.
Where have you been?

11:46.166 --> 11:48.033
-With Stan.
-Stan?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.700
We had the most wonderful time.
I'll tell you about it in the morning.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.433
This is the morning.

11:53.066 --> 11:57.100
Well, so it is. So it is.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.767
Six cakes of soap...

12:06.834 --> 12:08.600
Dorothy, please speak to me.

12:08.667 --> 12:09.900
A can of cleanser...

12:09.967 --> 12:12.567
No. I'm not getting the cleanser
until you talk to me.

12:12.633 --> 12:15.734
(sighs) If you won't talk,

12:15.800 --> 12:18.500
how can I understand
why you're angry with me?

12:18.567 --> 12:20.700
Coffee and a walk
along the beach.

12:20.767 --> 12:21.500
What about it?

12:21.567 --> 12:24.867
When you return from
a walk along the beach,

12:24.934 --> 12:28.900
you spend hours shaking sand
from your underalls.

12:28.967 --> 12:30.867
Just what do you mean?

12:30.934 --> 12:34.567
Blanche Devereaux
doesn't spend all night with a man

12:34.633 --> 12:36.367
just to walk along the beach.

12:36.433 --> 12:41.367
Never before, but as Beauregard Jefferson
said on my 16th birthday,

12:41.433 --> 12:42.934
there's a first time for everything.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.567
Last night was the first time
you slept with Stan.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.500
-No!
-It wasn't the first time!

12:49.567 --> 12:52.533
Oh, Dorothy! Dorothy--

12:52.600 --> 12:54.133
Move, you old fool!

12:54.200 --> 12:55.367
Dorothy!

12:57.533 --> 12:59.633
Why won't you believe me?

12:59.700 --> 13:01.667
Why does it matter?

13:01.734 --> 13:04.433
You're not married anymore.
You don't even like Stan.

13:04.500 --> 13:07.900
You begged me to go out with him.

13:07.967 --> 13:10.667
You're angry because
I didn't have a terrible time?

13:10.734 --> 13:14.467
-Why do you care?
-I don't know. I know I'm upset

13:14.533 --> 13:17.133
because I'm letting this upset me.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.367
Blanche, I'm sorry.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.600
That's all right. That's all right.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.567
You were dumped by the man
of your dreams.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.200
It's not surprising you're irritable.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.700
Yes, but to be upset about Stan...

13:29.767 --> 13:30.834
I'm so embarrassed.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.500
He doesn't mean anything in my life.

13:33.567 --> 13:37.033
I know what you're going through.
Believe me.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.200
I'm just so glad we talked.

13:39.266 --> 13:40.934
Oh...

13:42.533 --> 13:45.133
Because if we hadn't,
I'd feel strange

13:45.200 --> 13:47.567
about going out with Stan again tonight.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.100
You're going out with Stan tonight?

13:52.166 --> 13:54.133
To the Burt Reynolds
dinner theater.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.133
You're going?

13:55.200 --> 13:59.367
Of course I am.
I'd be crazy to miss seeing Mr. Jamie Farr

13:59.433 --> 14:01.333
in <i>The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.</i>

14:02.166 --> 14:04.100
Oh, my back! I'm paralyzed!

14:04.166 --> 14:05.533
Sophia?

14:06.667 --> 14:08.400
Oh, it's you.
Look where you're going.

14:09.734 --> 14:12.500
We're almost through with our half.

14:12.567 --> 14:15.133
Rose, tomorrow
I'm doubling the sandwiches.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.567
Grab some aluminum foil.

14:16.633 --> 14:21.500
You're still selling lunches even after
that Johnny-No-Thumbs leaned on you?

14:21.567 --> 14:23.400
He didn't lean on us, Blanche.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.734
He said his friends would lean on us.

14:26.667 --> 14:27.800
Well, I got friends, too.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.934
One call to Palermo,
and Johnny's lunch wagon

14:31.000 --> 14:33.100
will be wearing concrete tires.

14:33.166 --> 14:37.166
The only person you know
in Palermo is Uncle Vito.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.900
He's a harmless old man.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.266
Harmless? Give him some piano wire,

14:41.333 --> 14:42.867
make fun of his limp, and watch.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.834
Do you think they'll
really make any money?

14:46.900 --> 14:48.867
One fabric softener...

14:48.934 --> 14:50.066
Now what's the matter?

14:50.133 --> 14:51.767
I'll tell you.

14:51.834 --> 14:55.200
I cannot believe you're actually
seeing Stan again.

14:55.266 --> 14:56.934
Why shouldn't I?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.667
Right. I thought
you were my friend.

14:59.734 --> 15:00.900
I am.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.567
You're sleeping with my husband!

15:05.667 --> 15:09.133
What's everybody looking at?
Get on back to your peas.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.767
I promise, there's nothing
between us.

15:11.834 --> 15:15.667
Then you won't see him tonight.
Isn't that right?

15:15.734 --> 15:20.600
We're only seeing a play,
and he's her ex-husband.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.867
Why am I even explaining to you?

15:22.934 --> 15:25.266
Why am I explaining to anybody?

15:33.533 --> 15:34.867
Who's Lenny?

15:34.934 --> 15:37.667
Tall, red hair, loves tuna on wheat.

15:37.734 --> 15:41.233
Why do we have his I.O.U.
For 2 bucks?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.100
He didn't have anything
smaller than a hundred,

15:43.166 --> 15:46.100
-and we didn't have change.
-What about these?

15:46.166 --> 15:47.867
They all had hundreds.

15:49.633 --> 15:52.133
Rose. Let me give you
lessons in economics.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.867
Lesson 1...
quit being an idiot.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.533
Okay.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.767
Lesson 2...
the law of supply and demand.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.533
Before you supply the sandwiches,
demand the money.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.266
Okay.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.700
Lesson 3...
quit being an idiot.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.033
I thought you were Blanche.

16:12.100 --> 16:15.834
Once I thought I was Bess Truman,
then they switched me to 20mgs a day.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.433
I had a cousin who thought
he was Jiminy Cricket.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.533
That was at the height of
the <i>Pinocchio</i> craze,

16:22.600 --> 16:24.500
and everyone at the bank
went along.

16:25.600 --> 16:29.533
And I wondered how you two
got together to start a business.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.767
Let me know when Blanche comes in.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.200
Are you two talking?

16:32.266 --> 16:35.367
Just long enough to give her
a piece of my mind.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.934
You think Dorothy's upset 'cause she
thinks Blanche is sleeping with Stan?

16:39.000 --> 16:39.900
Could be.

16:39.967 --> 16:42.567
Or is it because she thinks she's lying
when she says she isn't?

16:42.633 --> 16:43.700
That's good, too.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.700
Don't you care they're fighting?

16:45.767 --> 16:48.633
I do. You think
I have no feelings?

16:48.700 --> 16:51.700
Let me tell you a story.
Picture this.

16:51.767 --> 16:55.767
A crowded Mediterranean port
teeming with your tired,

16:55.834 --> 16:57.567
your poor, your hungry.

16:57.633 --> 17:00.667
You know, your huddled
masses yearning to be free.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.166
We boarded the ship
and set sail for America.

17:04.233 --> 17:09.934
500 people filled with hope,
singing, laughing, drinking.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.200
Actually, only the Irish
were drinking, but I digress.

17:14.266 --> 17:19.066
On the second day,
things turned for the worse.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.967
For the next month and a half,
the storm-tossed seas

17:22.033 --> 17:24.033
made our lives a living hell.

17:24.100 --> 17:26.433
If I wasn't fighting for
a warm blanket,

17:26.500 --> 17:29.633
I was fighting for food.
If I wasn't fighting for food,

17:29.700 --> 17:32.600
I was fighting for
the shuffleboard equipment.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.800
Just threw that in to see
if you were paying attention.

17:35.934 --> 17:40.667
Anyway, the storm broke,
and through the mist and the haze,

17:40.734 --> 17:44.500
I saw the beautiful lady
I'd been longing to see for months.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.367
The Statue of Liberty.

17:46.433 --> 17:51.000
No, my mother.
That's how dense the fog was.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.333
Beyond her was the Statue of Liberty.

17:54.400 --> 18:00.033
I remember my first words...
there she is, lady liberty.

18:00.100 --> 18:02.567
I remember my second words...

18:02.633 --> 18:05.367
slow down, you yutz.
You're going past her.

18:06.934 --> 18:08.300
But he didn't hear.

18:09.266 --> 18:11.233
And that's why today, Rose,

18:11.300 --> 18:14.000
there's an unusually large
Italian population

18:14.066 --> 18:16.166
in Spilsbury, Massachusetts.

18:16.934 --> 18:20.166
That's a moving story.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.700
What's the point?

18:21.767 --> 18:25.533
The point is, you already
forgot lessons 1 and 3...

18:25.600 --> 18:26.900
quit being an idiot.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.333
I stole 40 bucks from you

18:29.400 --> 18:32.200
while you were listening
to that cockamamie story.

18:32.767 --> 18:34.266
-She's not back yet?
-No.

18:34.333 --> 18:37.767
Why? What could they
be doing all this time?

18:37.834 --> 18:40.266
-You know.
-I also know Stan.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.266
We were married 38 years.

18:42.333 --> 18:46.133
If you added up the times
we did what he's doing,

18:46.200 --> 18:48.467
Blanche is still 15 minutes late.

18:51.033 --> 18:52.266
Where are you going?

18:52.333 --> 18:54.734
To either get ice cream
or commit a felony.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.500
I'll decide in the car.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.100
(doorbell rings)

19:09.233 --> 19:12.934
-Yes?
-I'm Vinnie. This is Rocco.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.700
Johnny-No-Thumbs sent us.

19:18.233 --> 19:20.567
Sophia, it's for you.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.500
(giggling)

19:30.567 --> 19:31.667
Yeah...

19:31.734 --> 19:33.433
(knock on door)

19:33.500 --> 19:35.200
-Who's there?
-(Dorothy) Dorothy.

19:35.266 --> 19:36.266
Dorothy!

19:36.333 --> 19:39.033
Stay there. I'll get rid of her.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.600
Dorothy, it's late. What do you want?

19:43.667 --> 19:45.166
Open the door, Stanley.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.300
You're in your nightgown.

19:50.367 --> 19:52.767
I came on an impulse.
I couldn't help myself.

19:52.834 --> 19:57.233
Well, that's really a nice gesture, babe,
but I'll have to take a rain check.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.500
You truly are one chromosome away
from being a potato.

20:06.066 --> 20:09.066
I get up early. I need some sleep.

20:09.133 --> 20:12.533
You're wearing your toupee to bed.
That means one of two things.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.033
Either a woman's in your bed,
or Suzanne Somers is on<i> The Tonight Show.</i>

20:18.333 --> 20:19.533
Would you get to your point?

20:19.600 --> 20:22.433
I'm not here to see you, just her.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.533
Dorothy, you--

20:23.600 --> 20:26.767
Afterwards, you can go back
to what you were doing.

20:27.734 --> 20:28.867
Thank you.

20:30.433 --> 20:33.533
I've been trying to understand
why you're doing this.

20:33.600 --> 20:39.066
To find one reason that would
make it okay, but I can't.

20:39.133 --> 20:44.700
I... I cannot believe that you would
jeopardize our relationship for this.

20:46.300 --> 20:49.000
I guess it's possible
you were attracted to Stan.

20:49.066 --> 20:51.500
Lord knows, I stayed with him
for 38 years,

20:51.567 --> 20:55.200
but...I think this time,
you could have resisted

20:55.266 --> 20:58.333
just in case it might have mattered to me.

20:59.467 --> 21:04.333
I think what hurts me most
is you didn't have the guts

21:04.400 --> 21:06.433
to tell me you're
sleeping with my husband.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.200
Well, gee, I would have.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.834
But I didn't know myself
until an hour ago.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.000
(laughing)

21:26.800 --> 21:28.133
Hey, what's all this?

21:28.200 --> 21:30.200
Aren't they beautiful?

21:30.266 --> 21:31.700
Johnny-No-Thumbs sent them.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.233
He sent you flowers?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.800
Remember harmless old Uncle Vito?

21:35.867 --> 21:37.867
He sent a note to Johnny-No-Thumbs,

21:37.934 --> 21:40.467
addressed to "Johnny-No-Knees."

21:42.066 --> 21:44.767
He got the message.
We got the flowers.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.233
Come on, ma.

21:46.300 --> 21:49.667
I also told him we're leaving
the sandwich game.

21:49.734 --> 21:53.667
The books showed the profits
weren't what we expected.

21:53.734 --> 21:54.967
Is Blanche back yet?

21:55.033 --> 21:57.166
-She's in the living room.
-Thanks.

22:02.333 --> 22:04.133
Blanche, I want to apologize.

22:05.233 --> 22:06.500
Okay.

22:07.734 --> 22:09.100
I apologize.

22:09.166 --> 22:10.433
That's it?

22:11.233 --> 22:14.133
What else can I say?
I behaved terribly.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.033
I know.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.467
No, you don't.

22:16.533 --> 22:19.133
Oh, I went to Stan's room tonight

22:19.200 --> 22:20.934
because I thought you were there.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.300
Well, I wasn't.

22:22.367 --> 22:26.300
I told him although nothing happened,
I couldn't see him anymore.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.467
I've been such a creep.

22:29.533 --> 22:30.567
I know.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.033
I wish I could explain it, but I can't.

22:34.967 --> 22:37.700
I think some of it may be that I...

22:37.767 --> 22:40.100
didn't want to share
my memories.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.500
That part of my life is over,

22:42.567 --> 22:45.734
but I still wanted it to be just mine.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.934
I was afraid that you might
take that part away.

22:50.934 --> 22:56.867
I was feeling jealous and lonely
and God knows what else.

22:56.934 --> 22:57.834
Magenta.

22:59.433 --> 23:01.667
-Excuse me?
-Magenta.

23:01.734 --> 23:03.200
That's what I call feeling that way...

23:03.266 --> 23:06.066
All kinds of feelings tumbling
all over themselves.

23:06.133 --> 23:09.000
You're not blue because you're not sad,

23:09.066 --> 23:12.300
and although you're jealous,
you're not green with envy.

23:12.367 --> 23:15.266
And every now and then,
you realize you're scared,

23:15.333 --> 23:18.667
but you'd hardly call yourself yellow.

23:18.734 --> 23:23.066
I hate that feeling,
and I hate the color magenta.

23:23.667 --> 23:25.333
That's why I named it that.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.533
Magenta.

23:27.934 --> 23:31.166
No way to explain it,
but between friends,

23:31.233 --> 23:32.500
you don't have to.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.133
Oh, Dorothy.

23:41.066 --> 23:43.567
Dorothy. Listen.

23:43.633 --> 23:46.400
Now that we're talking,
can I ask you a question?

23:47.000 --> 23:49.200
Why did you ever marry Stan?

23:51.567 --> 23:53.266
It was my magenta period.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.066
And Stan was rather handsome
when he had hair.

23:58.133 --> 23:59.066
Come on.

23:59.633 --> 24:02.266
He had a certain... elegant charm.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.600
Oh, please.

24:03.667 --> 24:06.433
And, of course, I was
four months' pregnant.

24:14.834 --> 24:17.834
