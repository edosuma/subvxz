- You didn't have my back
at all in there tonight.

19:07.923 --> 19:09.380
- Well, I told you
to tread lightly

19:09.422 --> 19:11.839
with the religion stuff.
I mean, I love you,

19:11.881 --> 19:14.297
but I-I'm still adjusting.
- Adjusting?

19:14.339 --> 19:16.339
- Yeah, you kinda Trojan
horse'd

19:16.380 --> 19:19.464
Jesus into our relationship.

19:19.505 --> 19:22.797
- Oh, and does being Christian
make me harder to love?

19:22.839 --> 19:25.714
It's still just me!
- I know that.

19:27.047 --> 19:28.923
No, I do know that.
- And you know what?

19:28.964 --> 19:30.797
You have weird things, too.

19:30.839 --> 19:33.589
Like, you write a thank you
letter to every house you sell,

19:33.631 --> 19:35.797
not even the client,
the, the actual house.

19:35.839 --> 19:38.714
But I support you.

19:38.756 --> 19:42.547
Why can't you support me?
- I do, I do support you.

19:42.589 --> 19:44.130
But no-you're right.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.672
You're right, we all have our
weird things

19:47.714 --> 19:49.756
and from now on,

19:49.797 --> 19:51.464
I support you,

19:51.505 --> 19:53.422
and all of your holy spirits.

19:54.297 --> 19:56.714
- There's just one...

19:57.380 --> 20:00.505
one holy spirit.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.505
- One holy spirit.

20:06.923 --> 20:09.172
I love you.
- Love you, too.

20:10.797 --> 20:14.839
- Ugh! I mean, you were good
in there.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.505
Thank God Richard showed up,
though.

20:16.547 --> 20:17.756
- [Small chuckle]
- [Sighs]

20:17.797 --> 20:19.339
- I texted him as soon
as I saw Ginny Kelly.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.339
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.214
You did? Genius!
- Yeah.

20:24.505 --> 20:27.422
- Thanks for taking care
of me today.

20:27.464 --> 20:30.422
It's my pleasure.

20:32.714 --> 20:34.339
I like protecting you.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.589
- Mhmm. [Sighs]

20:37.631 --> 20:39.881
- Well, I guess this means
we're even?

20:39.923 --> 20:43.505
- Well, no,
but you did good today.

20:45.839 --> 20:47.547
Hey, how 'bout I take you
to dinner?

20:47.589 --> 20:49.339
- Don't you have plans?

20:49.380 --> 20:50.756
- Not anymore.

20:50.797 --> 20:52.714
Come on, let's go!

20:54.422 --> 20:56.422
- Okay.
- [Chuckles]

21:00.547 --> 21:03.380
- Think you're gonna be able
to keep anything down?

21:03.422 --> 21:04.839
- It's touch and go.

21:07.756 --> 21:09.964
- There was like a lot of
exaggerating going on in there.
