WEBVTT

00:00.648 --> 00:01.847
This is it?

00:01.883 --> 00:03.649
These are all
the remains we have?

00:03.685 --> 00:04.984
Yes.

00:05.019 --> 00:07.186
Can you get any kind
of an ID from these?

00:07.222 --> 00:08.421
Well, the length

00:08.456 --> 00:10.990
and lack of curvature
of the femur

00:11.025 --> 00:12.725
indicates the victim
was a Negroid male,

00:12.760 --> 00:14.827
approximately six-foot-two
in height.

00:14.863 --> 00:15.728
Nice.

00:15.763 --> 00:17.263
But no name?

00:17.298 --> 00:19.599
Right.
So you have too few bones,

00:19.634 --> 00:22.001
I have too many particulates.
So far,

00:22.036 --> 00:23.703
I've got salmon, chicken,

00:23.738 --> 00:25.204
corn, whole wheat flour...

00:25.240 --> 00:26.906
Is it wrong that I'm
starting to get hungry?

00:26.941 --> 00:28.741
...Vitamin B-12,
yellow #5,

00:28.776 --> 00:30.309
carrageenen,

00:30.345 --> 00:32.445
antifreeze...
Ugh, on second thought...

00:33.882 --> 00:35.181
Was the DNA viable?

00:35.216 --> 00:36.983
Yes, and it did confirm

00:37.018 --> 00:38.217
that all the pieces we have

00:38.253 --> 00:39.652
came from the same person.

00:39.687 --> 00:41.320
But whoever he is,

00:41.356 --> 00:42.889
he didn't come up
on any database.

00:42.924 --> 00:44.290
All the animal predation

00:44.325 --> 00:46.425
on the right metacarpal,
it's gonna be tough to separate

00:46.461 --> 00:49.328
the peri- from
the postmortem trauma.

00:49.364 --> 00:50.563
Okay.

00:50.598 --> 00:51.864
Take a look at this.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.767
I created a map

00:54.802 --> 00:56.702
showing where each
body part was found.

00:56.738 --> 00:59.572
Whoa, no wonder rats went
to town on this hand.

00:59.607 --> 01:01.841
It was left in a Dumpster
behind a restaurant.

01:01.876 --> 01:03.709
Does the map say anything
about a waterlogged

01:03.745 --> 01:05.444
upper leg?

01:06.881 --> 01:08.314
Someone left the lids

01:08.349 --> 01:10.349
of their trash cans
open when it rained.

01:10.385 --> 01:12.285
We-we don't have nearly
enough information.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.200
Which means you can make it
to your appointment.

01:14.222 --> 01:15.421
Well, why?

01:15.456 --> 01:16.689
We've solved murders

01:16.724 --> 01:18.624
with minimal sets
of remains before.

01:18.660 --> 01:19.992
If you need me to stay...
No.

01:20.028 --> 01:21.127
It's the last day

01:21.162 --> 01:22.461
of his clinical trial.

01:22.497 --> 01:23.763
Oh.

01:23.798 --> 01:26.232
Of... of course you
can go, Mr. Bray.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.034
You must feel relieved.

01:28.069 --> 01:29.969
Yes. And as long as
I stay in remission,

01:30.004 --> 01:31.270
I'll be very relieved.

01:31.306 --> 01:33.940
I'll tell Booth
to have the FBI techs

01:33.975 --> 01:35.741
comb the area for
additional remains.

01:35.777 --> 01:37.577
I'll see if there's any pattern

01:37.612 --> 01:39.045
to the dumping
of the body parts.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.447
Maybe that will
help them.

01:46.187 --> 01:48.087
You are approaching
a railroad crossing

01:48.122 --> 01:50.690
and are unable to see 400 feet
in one direction.

01:50.725 --> 01:53.726
Is the speed limit
A) 15 miles per hour,

01:53.761 --> 01:56.963
B) 20, or C) 25?

01:57.865 --> 01:59.966
You have five seconds.

02:02.637 --> 02:04.236
Um... it's...

02:04.272 --> 02:06.038
Pull over. You're wrong.

02:06.074 --> 02:08.107
Damn! You know what?
I knew that one.

02:08.142 --> 02:10.276
You haven't finished
traffic school yet?

02:10.311 --> 02:11.611
Really have to sneak up
on me like that, okay?

02:11.646 --> 02:13.012
Listen, I have a lot more
to do here, all right?

02:13.047 --> 02:14.780
And if I don't pass,

02:14.816 --> 02:17.083
then Regulations is not gonna
allow me to go out in the field.

02:17.118 --> 02:18.484
Well, you shouldn't have left it
to the last minute.

02:18.519 --> 02:20.720
Thanks, Mom. I
appreciate it. Anyways,

02:20.755 --> 02:22.855
all this is crazy 'cause
of a couple of traffic tickets.

02:22.890 --> 02:24.991
Just a couple?
A couple. You know, cops,

02:25.026 --> 02:26.859
they gotta make their quota.
Right?

02:26.894 --> 02:29.195
That's what they do.
Anyways, Bones called.

02:29.230 --> 02:30.863
She wants the techs to go
back out in the field

02:30.898 --> 02:31.864
and look for more body parts.

02:31.899 --> 02:33.132
Yeah, I'm
already on it.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.500
Uh, Angela sent
over some help.

02:34.535 --> 02:36.168
See, by triangulating

02:36.204 --> 02:37.870
the locations of the body parts
we already recovered,

02:37.905 --> 02:39.171
she was able
to significantly

02:39.207 --> 02:40.940
narrow down the search area,

02:40.975 --> 02:42.508
which she then
cross-referenced

02:42.543 --> 02:43.909
with the garbage truck
pickup routes...

02:43.945 --> 02:45.144
Enough, enough,

02:45.179 --> 02:46.145
enough with the squint talk.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.480
If I wanted to talk squint,

02:47.515 --> 02:48.781
I would go to,
you know, Squint Land.

02:48.816 --> 02:50.783
Right. So a lot...
a lot of the garbage

02:50.818 --> 02:52.551
is already at the dump,
but there's

02:52.587 --> 02:53.686
one more neighborhood
where the garbage

02:53.721 --> 02:54.887
hasn't been
picked up yet.

02:54.922 --> 02:56.322
Thing is, we've only got, uh...

02:56.357 --> 02:57.556
53 minutes.

02:57.592 --> 02:58.858
Tell you what, why...

02:58.893 --> 03:00.793
Are you studying Section Three?
For help,

03:00.828 --> 03:02.828
press Control-Shift-H.
For sample questions, press...

03:02.864 --> 03:04.664
Uh, you know what, I can't...
I can't go.

03:04.699 --> 03:06.465
I gotta stay here and
I gotta finish this test, okay?

03:06.501 --> 03:07.981
So I tell you what,
why don't you just

03:08.002 --> 03:09.802
go with Bones,
you take her,

03:09.837 --> 03:11.170
it'll be a good way
for me to see

03:11.205 --> 03:12.238
how you handle working with her.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.539
Okay. We get along.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.041
Shouldn't be a problem.

03:15.076 --> 03:16.475
Well, she's got a very,
you know,

03:16.511 --> 03:17.877
original way of dealing with things.
Right.

03:17.912 --> 03:20.046
I like original.

03:22.050 --> 03:25.551
Well, that should
be interesting.

03:27.955 --> 03:29.355
Like looking for a prize

03:29.390 --> 03:31.057
at the bottom of a cereal box.

03:31.092 --> 03:33.459
Apparently, you and I eat
different kinds of cereal.

03:33.494 --> 03:35.194
I'm putting my money
on the Mafia.

03:35.229 --> 03:37.163
The way the body
was hacked up?

03:37.198 --> 03:39.865
Very organized-crimey.
Your speculation

03:39.901 --> 03:42.535
is a waste of my time, Agent Aubrey.
Right.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.210
You know, cancel
the Mafia thing. For now.

03:44.238 --> 03:47.006
So much for pineapple being
my least favorite topping.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.775
Wow. Booth is a lucky man.

03:49.811 --> 03:53.145
Traffic school's looking
pretty good right about now.

03:53.181 --> 03:54.413
I don't think Booth
is enjoying it at all.

03:54.449 --> 03:55.815
Has anyone ever told you

03:55.850 --> 03:57.349
you say some pretty
bizarre things?

03:57.385 --> 03:59.105
No, but I'm guessing that's
about to change.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.586
There's nothing here.

04:00.621 --> 04:02.855
Perhaps we'll have better luck
around the corner.

04:02.890 --> 04:04.090
I hope so.

04:04.125 --> 04:05.391
According to Angie's map,

04:05.426 --> 04:06.959
that is the only street left.

04:06.994 --> 04:09.161
Dude, hurry up before
someone calls the popos.

04:09.197 --> 04:12.031
Chillax. We gotta
do the intro first.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.332
Yo.

04:13.367 --> 04:16.402
McCarthy Middle School,
what's up?

04:16.437 --> 04:17.769
We're the Crash Brothers.

04:17.805 --> 04:20.206
And today, we got
a little something for you

04:20.241 --> 04:21.707
we like to call
Human Bowling.

04:21.743 --> 04:23.843
There, it's done.
Now get in the cart already.

04:23.878 --> 04:26.312
Okay. Here goes
nothing.

04:26.347 --> 04:27.713
If we don't make it,

04:27.749 --> 04:28.981
I love you, Mom.

04:31.419 --> 04:32.752
That's odd.

04:32.787 --> 04:34.420
It appears these trash cans

04:34.455 --> 04:35.588
have been arranged like a...

04:35.623 --> 04:37.523
Like bowling pins.

04:37.558 --> 04:39.425
Oh, this is
so not good.

04:39.460 --> 04:40.793
And yet,
I can't wait.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.466
What...?

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:59.347 --> 05:01.013
Oh, that's definitely
going viral.

05:02.683 --> 05:05.851
Turns out they
were quite helpful.

05:39.314 --> 05:40.580
Good news.

05:40.615 --> 05:42.849
FBI techs found
more of our victim

05:42.884 --> 05:45.306
in a trash compactor
in rural Maryland

05:45.307 --> 05:46.473
and in a dump

05:46.509 --> 05:48.675
just outside
Roanoke.

05:48.711 --> 05:51.078
Based on the texturing
of the auricular surfaces

05:51.113 --> 05:54.314
of the ilia, the victim
was in his early 50s.

05:54.350 --> 05:56.150
Are you gonna do anything
special tonight, Wendell?

05:56.185 --> 05:57.851
To celebrate the end
of your clinical trial?

05:57.887 --> 05:59.286
Um, I hadn't really
thought about it.

05:59.321 --> 06:00.654
Well, you deserve
to have some fun

06:00.689 --> 06:01.822
after what you've been through.

06:01.857 --> 06:03.790
Well, many people become

06:03.826 --> 06:06.126
extremely intoxicated
to celebrate.

06:06.162 --> 06:09.029
I'll keep
that in mind.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.831
The posterior plane
of the thorax

06:10.866 --> 06:13.133
shows signs of
animal predation.

06:13.169 --> 06:15.536
Based on the length
of these punctures,

06:15.571 --> 06:17.771
these look more like stab wounds
than damage from teeth.

06:17.773 --> 06:18.972
I'll be able to confirm that

06:19.008 --> 06:20.474
once the thorax is clean.

06:20.509 --> 06:22.876
Look at the ulna, Mr. Bray.

06:25.314 --> 06:26.680
Judging by
the pattern

06:26.715 --> 06:28.682
of kerf and striae,
the victim was likely

06:28.717 --> 06:30.217
dismembered by some type
of reciprocating saw.

06:30.252 --> 06:32.619
Well, if we can
discover what kind,

06:32.655 --> 06:34.555
that may lead us to the murderer.
I'll make a Micro-Sil mold of

06:34.590 --> 06:36.723
the groove marks and see
if we can find a match.

06:38.427 --> 06:40.894
<i>Is it too much to ask</i>

06:40.930 --> 06:42.462
for a complete skull?

06:42.498 --> 06:44.932
I mean, sometimes these
murderers are so inconsiderate.

06:44.967 --> 06:47.248
Well, and since no one of our
victim's age, race or gender

06:47.269 --> 06:48.735
was reported
missing,

06:48.771 --> 06:50.971
your facial reconstruction
needs to be exact.

06:51.006 --> 06:52.639
Hmm. No pressure.
Thanks.

06:52.675 --> 06:53.941
The victim's DNA

06:53.976 --> 06:56.476
indicates he
was biracial.

06:58.147 --> 06:59.279
Bingo.

06:59.315 --> 07:00.948
Okay, Randall
Fairbanks.

07:00.983 --> 07:02.449
Age 51.

07:02.484 --> 07:04.184
Professor Randall
Fairbanks.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.253
Looks like he taught
psychology at Kenmore College.

07:06.288 --> 07:07.421
Why wouldn't
the college

07:07.456 --> 07:09.356
file a missing
persons report

07:09.391 --> 07:12.793
if one of their professors
went MIA for an entire week?

07:12.828 --> 07:14.695
According to
this calendar,

07:14.730 --> 07:17.598
he started his sabbatical
two weeks ago.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.270
Are you okay with this?

07:23.305 --> 07:24.638
Uh, what
we're doing?

07:24.673 --> 07:25.839
Well, I've been on a lot

07:25.874 --> 07:27.474
of murder investigations,
Agent Aubrey.

07:27.509 --> 07:28.642
I'm quite used to it.

07:28.677 --> 07:29.943
But with me,
I mean.

07:29.979 --> 07:32.312
Because I think
it's really cool.

07:32.348 --> 07:33.680
I'm sure you do,

07:33.716 --> 07:35.549
but I will be
reserving judgment

07:35.584 --> 07:39.052
until I can judge
your value as a colleague.

07:39.088 --> 07:41.521
So I guess warmth
isn't your thing.

07:41.557 --> 07:43.357
I don't really
have things.

07:43.392 --> 07:46.026
These flowers
are all wrong.

07:46.061 --> 07:48.590
I don't think they look
half bad, for a guy who lived alone.

07:48.590 --> 07:50.597
Well, these hydrangeas
along the bottom,

07:50.633 --> 07:52.933
they're pink, while
they should be blue.

07:52.968 --> 07:54.901
I've seen a similar
growth pattern

07:54.937 --> 07:57.004
on willow-leaf
petunias

07:57.039 --> 07:59.706
while investigating
a killing field in Nicaragua.

07:59.742 --> 08:01.575
Blood. The high pH
of the blood

08:01.610 --> 08:03.090
could change the color
of the flowers.

08:03.112 --> 08:04.411
Yes.

08:04.446 --> 08:06.179
I'm surprised
you knew that.

08:06.215 --> 08:07.347
Well, I'm not
an idiot, Dr. Brennan.

08:07.383 --> 08:08.582
I took
chemistry.

08:08.617 --> 08:11.318
Well, the soil is
soaked with blood.

08:11.353 --> 08:12.986
So this could be
the murder site.

08:13.022 --> 08:14.855
Of course,
I'm reserving judgment

08:14.890 --> 08:16.823
till I have more information.
Yes, you should.

08:16.859 --> 08:18.225
What are you doing
back there?

08:18.260 --> 08:20.260
We can call the
police, you know.

08:20.296 --> 08:22.262
Oh, yeah, no.
We are the police.

08:22.298 --> 08:24.097
Uh, well, sort of.
FBI, actually,

08:24.133 --> 08:25.599
so we're sort of like
the super police.

08:25.634 --> 08:27.134
Uh, Special Agent Aubrey.

08:27.169 --> 08:28.335
This is Dr. Brennan
of the Jeffersonian.

08:28.370 --> 08:29.803
You're so young

08:29.838 --> 08:32.205
to be a G-man.
You be careful, sweetheart.

08:32.241 --> 08:33.373
Why are you

08:33.409 --> 08:34.674
snooping around?

08:34.710 --> 08:36.110
The man who lived here
was murdered.

08:36.145 --> 08:38.145
Oh, my...

08:38.179 --> 08:40.547
That's a lot more interesting
than mall walking.

08:40.582 --> 08:44.618
Anybody notice anything unusual
going on in the past few weeks?

08:44.653 --> 08:47.120
When wasn't there
something unusual going on?

08:47.156 --> 08:48.121
For years,
I'd hear screams

08:48.157 --> 08:49.589
almost every night.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.891
It was horrible.

08:50.926 --> 08:52.192
I heard it when I visited.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.587
And you never thought
to report it?

08:53.595 --> 08:55.329
We did.
But to the police,

08:55.364 --> 08:57.097
we were just crazy old ladies,
and he was

08:57.132 --> 08:58.465
some smarty-pants professor.
To be honest,

08:58.500 --> 09:00.434
I'm not surprised somebody
finally murdered him.

09:00.469 --> 09:02.402
I've thought
about doing it

09:02.438 --> 09:03.570
a few times myself.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.205
Barbara!
Well, just, just saying.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.480
Might not want
to be saying that

09:06.508 --> 09:08.308
in front of a federal agent.

09:08.344 --> 09:11.524
Who lives here
with all the birdhouses?

09:11.548 --> 09:13.247
Unfortunately, I do.

09:13.248 --> 09:16.116
Is that a camera on the bird feeder?
Yes, it's triggered

09:16.151 --> 09:17.951
whenever there's bird activity.

09:17.986 --> 09:20.087
We'll need to take it into evidence.
But it's

09:20.122 --> 09:21.555
hooded warbler migration season.

09:21.590 --> 09:22.923
Okay, you do realize

09:22.958 --> 09:25.959
this is a murder investigation?
But...

09:25.994 --> 09:29.863
well, just don't delete
any of the photos. Please.

09:29.898 --> 09:32.632
I'd love to see
the hooded warbler.

09:32.668 --> 09:34.401
Okay.

09:34.436 --> 09:36.002
I'm going back
to the Jeffersonian.

09:36.038 --> 09:38.038
I'll send a team
to comb the area.

09:38.073 --> 09:40.273
I hope I don't regret
leaving you alone.

09:40.309 --> 09:42.476
That's exactly what
my mother used to say.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.578
Just kidding.

09:44.613 --> 09:46.313
Sort of.

09:47.449 --> 09:49.449
<i>On a scale of one to ten,</i>

09:49.485 --> 09:52.319
how would you rate the quality
of your nursing care?

09:52.354 --> 09:54.721
Two, maybe two and a half.
What?!

09:54.757 --> 09:56.656
Ten. Of course a ten.

09:56.692 --> 09:58.191
11 if this were <i> Spinal Tap.</i>

10:00.696 --> 10:02.929
Well, that should
do it, Wendell.

10:02.965 --> 10:05.432
Your final dose.
Your labs look good,

10:05.467 --> 10:08.268
and heart rate--
everything looks good.

10:09.772 --> 10:12.472
I can't believe
it's finally over.

10:12.508 --> 10:15.108
I know.

10:16.845 --> 10:19.946
But unfortunately,
I still have

10:19.982 --> 10:21.782
a lot more questions
to ask you

10:21.817 --> 10:24.584
for the patient satisfaction survey.
How long is that thing?

10:25.954 --> 10:27.220
Oh, is that the page

10:27.256 --> 10:29.389
where you get to make up
your own questions?

10:29.425 --> 10:32.159
Yeah. That's exactly
what this page is.

10:33.395 --> 10:35.896
Oh, but I got another patient
coming in now.

10:35.931 --> 10:38.231
Maybe we can finish this later?

10:38.267 --> 10:41.001
Like... over lunch?

10:43.472 --> 10:44.704
Sure.

10:46.508 --> 10:49.242
I wouldn't want anyone thinking
I wasn't satisfied.

10:49.278 --> 10:51.178
Oop.

10:51.213 --> 10:53.847
I got to go, too. Work.

10:56.185 --> 10:58.485
See you soon, then.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.027
There is so much
blood in this soil,

11:07.062 --> 11:08.829
it is teeming with
blow fly maggots.

11:08.864 --> 11:10.464
This has got to be
the murder scene.

11:10.499 --> 11:12.866
So maybe you could figure
out the time of death

11:12.901 --> 11:14.367
by calculating
the soil conditions

11:14.403 --> 11:16.403
and absorption rate
of the blood?

11:17.339 --> 11:19.206
Aubrey! I am impressed!

11:19.241 --> 11:20.774
I <i> will</i> try that.

11:20.809 --> 11:22.375
There's blood
in the garage.

11:22.411 --> 11:24.711
I'll check the house.
Have fun.

11:24.746 --> 11:27.047
The blood
is all over the floor.

11:27.082 --> 11:28.381
Wow.

11:28.417 --> 11:30.183
Well, if the killer
used a motorized saw

11:30.219 --> 11:32.118
to dismember the victim,
maybe it's still in here.

11:32.154 --> 11:33.353
I already checked.
No saws.

11:33.388 --> 11:34.554
But there is
blood spatter

11:34.590 --> 11:37.123
and some tissue over here,

11:37.159 --> 11:39.526
and some
bone fragments mixed in.

11:39.561 --> 11:41.428
Hey, do you think
we're being tested,

11:41.463 --> 11:42.762
covering the crime scene?

11:42.798 --> 11:44.798
I'd like to think
the appropriate word

11:44.833 --> 11:46.900
is "respected," my friend.

11:49.671 --> 11:51.538
Sounds like
something's in here.

11:53.008 --> 11:54.508
Whatever it is,
it could be the source

11:54.543 --> 11:55.642
of the predation we found.

11:55.677 --> 11:57.244
Shh, shh.

12:05.687 --> 12:08.388
One, two, three...

12:08.423 --> 12:09.556
Aw.

12:09.591 --> 12:11.658
Just a cute little kitty.

12:11.693 --> 12:13.627
Poor thing's probably
been trapped in here

12:13.662 --> 12:15.629
ever since
Fairbanks died.

12:15.664 --> 12:16.997
I'll call
Animal Control.

12:17.032 --> 12:18.465
Oh, come on, Wendell,

12:18.500 --> 12:21.167
don't you think Skinner here
has been through enough?

12:21.203 --> 12:22.502
What, are you
gonna adopt him?

12:22.538 --> 12:23.937
Man, I wish that I could,

12:23.972 --> 12:26.339
but unfortunately,
Michael Vincent is allergic.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.241
Hey, maybe Dr. B
wants him for Christine.

12:28.277 --> 12:30.310
I believe Dr. Brennan's
exact words were:

12:30.345 --> 12:32.445
"domesticating animals is
a form of enslavement."

12:32.481 --> 12:34.581
And since I can't keep
a goldfish alive...

12:34.616 --> 12:36.456
I found a tablet
in the victim's house.

12:36.485 --> 12:38.518
I think this might
explain all the screaming

12:38.554 --> 12:40.754
the Golden Girls heard.

12:42.824 --> 12:44.324
No more.

12:44.359 --> 12:45.859
you're killing me!

12:45.894 --> 12:47.661
You're killing me!

12:47.696 --> 12:48.728
Please!

12:48.764 --> 12:50.730
Stop, please!

12:52.166 --> 12:53.993
So the woman from
the video is one of

12:53.994 --> 12:55.723
Professor Fairbanks'
grad students--

12:55.724 --> 12:57.624
a, uh, Tabitha Coleman.

12:57.659 --> 12:59.626
I know professors like
to torture their students,

12:59.661 --> 13:01.027
but this is unreal.

13:01.063 --> 13:02.729
Turns out
her screams weren't real.

13:02.764 --> 13:05.198
The video was recorded
as a part of an experiment.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.733
Well, what kind of experiment

13:06.768 --> 13:07.968
makes someone pretend
they're being tortured?

13:08.003 --> 13:09.336
Well, we're about
to find out.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.971
Nah-ha,<i> you</i> are
about to find out.

13:11.006 --> 13:13.473
You see, I have a date
with Officer Stop 'n Go.

13:13.508 --> 13:15.041
You know, between
you and your wife,

13:15.077 --> 13:16.910
I'm starting to feel like
I'm being rejected here.

13:16.945 --> 13:18.144
I thought you said
you could handle her.

13:18.180 --> 13:19.346
You got a sadistic streak,
you know that?

13:19.381 --> 13:21.414
I have to deal with
Officer Stop 'n Go.

13:21.450 --> 13:22.782
I mean, if I could,
I would change places

13:22.818 --> 13:25.485
with you in a second,
but I can't.

13:27.189 --> 13:28.788
Pfft!

13:28.824 --> 13:30.590
So, these are the video files

13:30.625 --> 13:32.959
of Professor Fairbanks'
experiments.

13:32.995 --> 13:35.001
He was researching
blind obedience.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.032
Blind obedience?

13:36.056 --> 13:38.299
Participants were told
they'd be administering

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
a quiz to a test taker
in the next room.

13:40.335 --> 13:43.303
For each incorrect answer,
the subjects pressed a button

13:43.338 --> 13:46.106
on a device they were told
delivered a shock

13:46.141 --> 13:47.507
to the test taker.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.009
What is the capital
of Peru?

13:49.044 --> 13:50.343
San Jose?

13:50.379 --> 13:51.978
With each wrong answer,
the shocks...

13:52.014 --> 13:53.680
grew more powerful.

13:53.715 --> 13:56.216
Oh, my God!
Oh, God! Please stop!

13:56.251 --> 13:57.484
Please. Oh, God.

13:57.519 --> 14:00.553
Of course,
that's my voice you hear.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.956
Prerecorded.
No actual shocks were delivered.

14:02.991 --> 14:05.458
But the subjects didn't know that.
Th-This is awful.

14:05.494 --> 14:08.161
Why didn't this kid just stop?
Based on our data,

14:08.196 --> 14:10.263
66% of subjects
administered the shocks

14:10.298 --> 14:13.166
all the way up to 450 volts,
which...

14:13.201 --> 14:14.944
theoretically is enough to kill.

14:14.968 --> 14:16.270
And the people who
administered the shocks,

14:16.271 --> 14:18.671
did they ever find out
what they were involved in?

14:18.707 --> 14:21.007
Because I'd imagine some of them
would have been pretty pissed

14:21.043 --> 14:23.810
to be manipulated like that.
Yes.

14:23.845 --> 14:25.779
Some of the subjects
were quite traumatized

14:25.814 --> 14:28.081
and resentful.
And...

14:28.116 --> 14:30.083
maybe vengeful?
Some.

14:30.118 --> 14:32.318
Yes.
I'm gonna need those video files,

14:32.354 --> 14:34.220
along with the names
of those subjects.

14:34.256 --> 14:36.656
I'm sorry,
but that information falls

14:36.691 --> 14:39.626
under doctor-patient
confidentiality.

14:43.098 --> 14:46.633
Okay, Skinner.
My simulated sun is shining.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.069
My blood is in the soil pack.

14:49.104 --> 14:52.372
Now let us see
how these plants absorb it.

14:52.407 --> 14:54.287
Buddy, you're gonna want
to see this, all right?

14:54.309 --> 14:55.809
This is gonna
be great.

14:55.844 --> 14:57.310
Ready?

15:11.726 --> 15:14.761
Wait a minute.

15:14.796 --> 15:16.262
That cannot be right.

15:16.298 --> 15:18.765
Are you having trouble
pinpointing time of death?

15:18.800 --> 15:20.767
I'm trying to extrapolate
the absorption rate

15:20.802 --> 15:23.403
of the victim's blood
into the hydrangea bushes.

15:23.438 --> 15:25.672
But unless time of death
was six minutes ago,

15:25.707 --> 15:27.740
my experiment is a bust.

15:27.776 --> 15:29.323
Oh, I would've thought
this would be easy for you.

15:29.347 --> 15:30.211
Great. That makes me

15:30.212 --> 15:31.911
feel much better.

15:34.182 --> 15:36.313
Perhaps you're distracted
by your furry friend.

15:36.314 --> 15:39.953
Uh, it's not Skinner. It's me. Well,

15:39.988 --> 15:42.255
I guess I'm gonna just need
to run the entire simulation

15:42.290 --> 15:44.624
again
with more blood.

15:44.659 --> 15:47.494
Uh, what the hell

15:47.529 --> 15:49.562
are you doing?
I second that.

15:49.598 --> 15:51.875
I need blood. Unless one
of you wants to volunteer?

15:51.876 --> 15:53.600
Uh, no, that's okay.
I'll pass.

15:53.635 --> 15:54.635
How
are the...

15:54.636 --> 15:56.569
bird cam photos coming along?

15:56.605 --> 15:58.071
Uh,
unfortunately,

15:58.106 --> 16:00.440
the camera only photographed
a small portion

16:00.475 --> 16:01.795
of the victim's
backyard. However,

16:01.810 --> 16:04.244
I did find some
shadows on the house.

16:04.279 --> 16:05.945
Shadows? What kind?

16:05.981 --> 16:08.248
Looks like someone
was coming and going

16:08.283 --> 16:09.949
from the professor's
French doors.

16:09.985 --> 16:11.784
I thought you might
have time of death,

16:11.820 --> 16:14.112
so I could narrow down
which photos to enhance.

16:14.113 --> 16:17.490
Hopefully I'll get it
before I run out of blood.

16:21.997 --> 16:25.331
And if you don't like roast
beef, I brought chicken salad.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.767
And if you're a vegetarian,
I brought a grilled veggie sandwich.

16:27.802 --> 16:29.702
You really didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.071
Hey, it is a patient
satisfaction survey, so...

16:32.107 --> 16:34.107
Oh, right, right.
The survey.

16:34.142 --> 16:36.075
Mm-hmm. So...

16:36.111 --> 16:39.913
what would you say was the best
part of your clinical trial?

16:39.948 --> 16:42.715
Being told I was cancer-free.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.784
I'm sorry.
That was the wrong answer.

16:44.819 --> 16:46.853
You were supposed
to say meeting me.

16:46.888 --> 16:49.355
Isn't there some kind of rule
against fraternizing

16:49.391 --> 16:51.257
with the patients?
Yeah.

16:51.293 --> 16:52.926
But you're not a patient
anymore.

16:52.961 --> 16:54.694
The trial is over.
Oh, so do you do

16:54.729 --> 16:56.429
this survey
with all your patients?

16:56.464 --> 16:59.465
Only those that share
a love of science

16:59.501 --> 17:00.900
and lame '80s music.

17:02.704 --> 17:05.905
So far you're the only one.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.241
Lucky me.

17:08.276 --> 17:11.411
You don't know the half of it.
Try the Caprese salad.

17:14.015 --> 17:16.049
Whoa. Dude, this
is fantastic.

17:16.084 --> 17:17.916
Thanks.

17:17.953 --> 17:20.619
So...

17:20.655 --> 17:23.890
I have, uh, my
own little survey.

17:23.925 --> 17:26.125
One question.
Shoot.

17:26.161 --> 17:30.029
Is it okay if I kiss you?

17:38.006 --> 17:42.742
All we're missing now is
a romantic '80s power ballad.

Techs pulled the right femur out
of a dump in Virginia.

18:04.132 --> 18:06.966
And the leg was found
in an off-duty trash truck.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.336
We must have about 70%
of the body right now.

18:09.337 --> 18:11.431
Hopefully that's enough
to find cause of death.

18:11.455 --> 18:13.140
Tearing of the tissue

18:13.141 --> 18:16.342
at the distal end of the tibia
and fibula is quite prominent

18:16.378 --> 18:19.245
but dull
at the proximal end.

18:19.281 --> 18:22.248
Maybe the saw blade broke
and was replaced by a new one.

18:22.284 --> 18:23.683
Was Dr. Hodgins able
to find the kind of saw

18:23.718 --> 18:25.118
that was used based
on the mold you made?

18:25.153 --> 18:26.853
The blade was
much too common

18:26.888 --> 18:29.255
to point to a specific saw.
You know, considering the victim

18:29.291 --> 18:30.890
spent his career messing
with people's minds,

18:30.925 --> 18:32.925
I'm not surprised
by what happened to him.

18:32.961 --> 18:34.294
Well, don't blame the professor.
I never would've pushed

18:34.329 --> 18:35.795
that button.
Well, according

18:35.830 --> 18:37.597
to the data,
you're more than likely to.

18:37.632 --> 18:40.833
Which is why civilized societies
can become barbaric.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.703
Germany had the most advanced
public education system

18:43.738 --> 18:44.971
in the world,

18:45.006 --> 18:46.739
impressive industrial
production,

18:46.775 --> 18:48.341
and yet they tried
to exterminate

18:48.376 --> 18:50.810
an entire race of people.
Okay then.

18:50.845 --> 18:53.613
Now I hate myself. Thank you very much.
The new thoracic vertebrae

18:53.648 --> 18:55.682
show signs of
multiple stab wounds.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.418
That could mean the left
ventricle was punctured.

18:58.453 --> 19:00.620
Which would have caused him
to bleed out.

19:00.655 --> 19:03.556
There's also bone chipping
on the anterior of the sternum.

19:03.591 --> 19:07.527
Whatever penetrated his rib cage
was shoved in with enough force

19:07.562 --> 19:11.164
to go through his entire torso
from back to front.

19:11.199 --> 19:12.532
A sword?
Hmm.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.233
None that I've ever seen before.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.671
I thought we didn't have names
for the students

19:18.707 --> 19:20.740
who participated
in the professor's experiments,

19:20.775 --> 19:23.376
only faces.
Well, that's all I needed.

19:23.411 --> 19:25.611
I used
facial recognition

19:25.647 --> 19:28.047
to cross-reference
student I.D. photos

19:28.083 --> 19:30.550
and found a kid
that Aubrey should talk to,

19:30.585 --> 19:32.485
this psych student
named...

19:32.520 --> 19:34.354
Alex Heck.
He looks pretty harmless to me.

19:34.389 --> 19:35.655
Well,
this is

19:35.690 --> 19:37.657
Alex's freshman year
I.D. photo.

19:37.692 --> 19:39.192
Take a look
at him now.

19:39.227 --> 19:42.829
Oh, wow. He has a record, too?
Yeah.

19:42.864 --> 19:44.430
Two counts of breaking
and entering

19:44.466 --> 19:46.366
into Professor
Fairbanks' house

19:46.401 --> 19:49.369
and dozens of threatening
e-mails to him.

19:49.404 --> 19:51.938
And he had a stay in the mental hospital?
When he dropped out

19:51.973 --> 19:53.306
of school.
And this is after

19:53.341 --> 19:54.841
Fairbanks experimented on him?

19:54.876 --> 19:56.743
Yeah.
Seems like once

19:56.778 --> 19:58.211
the evil genie
is out of the bottle,

19:58.246 --> 19:59.946
it's tough
to get him back in.

19:59.981 --> 20:03.750
Which explains Alex's e-mail
to Professor Fairbanks.

20:03.785 --> 20:08.054
"Until your experiment, I never
knew what a monster I truly was.

20:08.089 --> 20:12.692
What you've unleashed,
it's your fault."

20:18.806 --> 20:21.107
Why am I here?

20:21.142 --> 20:23.342
You have no reason
to bring me in.

20:23.378 --> 20:24.677
But we do,

20:24.712 --> 20:28.281
Alex. See,
Professor Fairbanks is dead.

20:29.350 --> 20:31.381
Yeah. So?
So you threatened him.

20:31.382 --> 20:33.920
Taste of his own medicine, right?
I don't think you understand.

20:33.955 --> 20:35.521
You're a suspect.

20:35.557 --> 20:36.989
Did anybody see me with him?

20:37.025 --> 20:38.925
Did anybody see me attack him?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.893
I don't think so.

20:40.929 --> 20:43.100
You don't really seem to care
about defending yourself.

20:43.124 --> 20:44.031
Yeah.

20:44.032 --> 20:45.965
So you lock me up. Prison,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.200
the loony bin--
it's all the same to me.

20:48.236 --> 20:50.436
So you saying you killed him?

20:51.372 --> 20:53.706
I could have.

20:53.741 --> 20:56.075
That's what he
proved, right?

20:56.110 --> 20:58.544
That I'm capable
of horrible things.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.546
Just like you.
This isn't about me, Alex.

21:00.582 --> 21:02.515
Sure, it is. His work
was about what any

21:02.550 --> 21:04.517
of us are capable of, even you.
I'd like

21:04.552 --> 21:06.719
to focus on you now.
I mean, you don't... you don't think

21:06.754 --> 21:09.522
that there were nice people
in Rwanda

21:09.557 --> 21:12.124
or Serbia or
even Syria?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.961
Fairbanks proved that given
the right circumstances,

21:14.996 --> 21:16.996
these nice people can pick up
a machete

21:17.031 --> 21:20.333
and hack someone to death.

21:22.136 --> 21:25.104
In-in the test,
I killed someone.

21:25.139 --> 21:26.405
But not for real.
I didn't know that

21:26.441 --> 21:29.342
at the time.

21:31.846 --> 21:33.412
I killed an innocent person,

21:33.448 --> 21:35.648
and I don't know how to live with that.
Well,

21:35.683 --> 21:38.985
maybe you wanted revenge.

21:39.887 --> 21:42.989
Maybe.

21:58.806 --> 22:00.239
This is my first nooner.

22:00.274 --> 22:01.607
Really?

22:01.643 --> 22:03.342
Um, you were supposed
to say "Mine, too."

22:03.378 --> 22:04.410
I was getting around to it.

22:05.747 --> 22:06.979
It's okay.

22:07.015 --> 22:08.714
It's exciting
how much we have

22:08.750 --> 22:11.050
to discover
about each other, isn't it?

22:11.085 --> 22:12.351
Wow!

22:12.387 --> 22:13.419
What?

22:13.454 --> 22:16.122
Nothing, I just...

22:16.157 --> 22:18.958
No, I just meant,
like, you and I

22:18.993 --> 22:21.861
feels right, doesn't it?

22:21.896 --> 22:24.063
I mean, it feels like
we've known each other forever.

22:24.098 --> 22:25.898
Yeah.

22:25.933 --> 22:28.067
It doesn't feel right to you?

22:28.102 --> 22:29.402
It sure seemed like it did.

22:29.437 --> 22:30.736
No.

22:30.772 --> 22:32.138
Sure it does.

22:32.173 --> 22:34.640
You're amazing.

22:34.676 --> 22:37.877
I guess everything's just,
you know, happening so fast.

22:37.912 --> 22:41.747
I know, but...
what the hell, right?

22:42.917 --> 22:45.851
Yeah, what the hell?

22:45.887 --> 22:47.920
You know, I should, I should
really get back to work.

22:47.955 --> 22:49.522
Really? I thought we were
gonna grab a bite?

22:49.557 --> 22:52.625
Yeah, I know, but, uh,
the time and, uh, um...

22:52.660 --> 22:55.661
a nooner isn't a really
good excuse for being late.

22:55.697 --> 22:57.730
Right.

23:02.370 --> 23:04.770
I'll call you later?

23:05.773 --> 23:07.973
Okay.

23:17.185 --> 23:19.618
There's evidence
of remodeling to the victim's

23:19.654 --> 23:22.154
lower left margin
of the mandible.

23:23.858 --> 23:25.624
Did you hear me, Mr. Bray?

23:25.660 --> 23:27.393
Um, yes. The mandible.

23:27.428 --> 23:29.161
Uh, and there are
remodeled fractures

23:29.197 --> 23:32.031
in the lateral curvature of
the sixth and seventh ribs.

23:32.066 --> 23:33.666
Are you okay?

23:33.701 --> 23:35.134
I'm not good at reading
people's emotions,

23:35.169 --> 23:36.569
but you do seem distracted.

23:36.604 --> 23:39.605
And yesterday you were
smiling excessively.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.973
I'm-I'm fine. Sorry.

23:41.008 --> 23:42.908
Then please concentrate.

23:42.944 --> 23:44.577
Judging by the degree
of remodeling,

23:44.612 --> 23:48.147
these injuries appear
to be about two years old.

23:48.182 --> 23:51.751
Just before Alex Heck was
confined to a mental hospital.

23:51.786 --> 23:53.185
Maybe he came back to
finish what he started.

23:53.221 --> 23:56.021
Um, Mr. Bray, take a look

23:56.057 --> 23:57.523
at this color variation

23:57.558 --> 23:59.058
in the inferior margin

23:59.093 --> 24:01.127
of the left side
of the mandible.

24:01.162 --> 24:03.496
It's a cadaveric bone graft.
Yes, but

24:03.531 --> 24:06.098
from the prevalence
of fibrous union,

24:06.134 --> 24:09.135
it's unlikely this procedure
was performed in the U.S.

24:09.170 --> 24:11.804
I'll run a DNA test to see
where the bone came from.

24:13.174 --> 24:15.007
I thought the problem was your

24:15.042 --> 24:16.609
simulated sun needed to set?

24:16.644 --> 24:18.043
Yes, but over days.

24:18.079 --> 24:19.845
So, let there

24:19.881 --> 24:22.381
not be light!

24:22.416 --> 24:23.849
Perfect.

24:23.885 --> 24:26.852
All right, now,
all I need to do

24:26.888 --> 24:28.988
is add the blood...

24:29.023 --> 24:31.490
and it is snack time

24:31.526 --> 24:35.227
for the hydrangeas.

24:35.263 --> 24:37.763
Excellent.

24:37.799 --> 24:39.532
Ready?

24:39.567 --> 24:41.400
And...

24:41.435 --> 24:43.502
go!

24:54.749 --> 24:56.382
Oh, hey!

24:56.417 --> 24:58.551
Look-- they're
starting to change.

24:58.586 --> 24:59.919
Wow, it's working!

24:59.954 --> 25:01.687
Okay, stop!

25:01.722 --> 25:05.724
Ooh, I didn't know
blood was so pretty.

25:07.395 --> 25:10.229
Yes. Yes.

25:10.264 --> 25:12.464
Yes! Yes!

25:12.500 --> 25:13.766
Yes!

25:13.801 --> 25:16.001
Time of death was eight days

25:16.037 --> 25:18.270
and 14 hours ago.
I'll go isolate

25:18.306 --> 25:21.907
the bird cam photos from around
that time and you should

25:21.943 --> 25:24.276
feed Skinner.

25:24.312 --> 25:26.445
Yes.

25:30.284 --> 25:31.750
Yes, Mr. Bray?

25:31.786 --> 25:33.252
I have the results
of the DNA test.

25:33.287 --> 25:36.088
The grafted bone came
from a Brazilian national.

25:36.123 --> 25:38.257
Oh, Fairbanks was
hospitalized in Brazil

25:38.292 --> 25:40.759
two years ago with
a broken mandible.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.795
It was a parasailing accident.

25:42.830 --> 25:44.129
Well, he wasn't
in good physical shape.

25:44.165 --> 25:46.165
Parasailing seems
like a foolish pursuit.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.200
So, he was in Brazil with
Tabitha the grad student?

25:48.236 --> 25:49.468
No.

25:49.503 --> 25:51.604
He was in Brazil
with another grad student.

25:51.639 --> 25:52.972
Victoria Andrews.

25:53.007 --> 25:54.173
And I have the credit card
statement showing

25:54.208 --> 25:55.841
that he paid
for her plane ticket.

25:55.877 --> 25:58.477
Before you change lanes,
you should always...

25:58.512 --> 25:59.879
Look in your side mirrors

25:59.914 --> 26:01.780
- and over your shoulder.
- Bam!

26:01.816 --> 26:03.349
Unless otherwise posted,

26:03.384 --> 26:05.150
the speed limit
in a school zone is...

26:05.186 --> 26:06.318
25.

26:06.354 --> 26:07.419
I knew that.

26:07.455 --> 26:09.021
Congratulations!

26:09.056 --> 26:11.123
Only nine more levels to go.

26:11.158 --> 26:12.491
"Nine"?
All right.

26:12.526 --> 26:13.926
Murder break-- a lot better

26:13.961 --> 26:15.361
than traffic school,
don't you think?

26:15.396 --> 26:17.429
So, whoa, whoa!
Wait a second.

26:17.465 --> 26:18.530
But one month after they got

26:18.566 --> 26:19.865
back from Brazil, she left town

26:19.901 --> 26:21.166
after getting expelled

26:21.202 --> 26:22.968
for trashing the lab.
And that was

26:23.004 --> 26:25.204
around the same time
that he started seeing Tabitha.

26:25.239 --> 26:27.172
Jealous lover gets dumped
and seeks revenge?

26:27.208 --> 26:30.042
What-- two years later?

26:30.077 --> 26:31.543
Seemed farfetched to me,
too, until I found out

26:31.579 --> 26:33.379
that Victoria just
moved back to the area

26:33.414 --> 26:34.480
to sell her sculptures.

26:34.515 --> 26:36.048
Wow.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.316
Garden art. Yeah?

26:37.351 --> 26:38.884
So what?
Dr. Brennan said

26:38.920 --> 26:40.419
that he was stabbed with
something that was really big

26:40.454 --> 26:42.021
like a sword.

26:42.056 --> 26:44.857
And Hodgins found traces
of copper, aluminum and steel

26:44.892 --> 26:46.325
in the victim's stab wounds.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.927
Right. Let me guess.
This is made out

26:47.962 --> 26:50.496
of aluminum, steel and copper.
Yup.

26:50.531 --> 26:53.532
And that picture-- taken
in Randall Fairbanks' yard.

26:53.567 --> 26:56.535
You might've just found
the murder weapon, my friend.

26:56.570 --> 26:59.171
Dr. Brennan's gonna be
so impressed.

26:59.206 --> 27:00.873
I'm impressed.

27:05.437 --> 27:07.700
<i>I did not kill Randall!</i>

27:07.701 --> 27:10.028
Okay? I wanted to
after he dumped me,

27:10.029 --> 27:11.761
but I decided that he ruined

27:11.797 --> 27:13.263
my life enough.
Well, then there are

27:13.298 --> 27:15.899
a few facts that you need
to explain, Victoria.

27:15.934 --> 27:19.269
You see, the metal tines
on your sculptures are

27:19.304 --> 27:22.272
a perfect match to stab wounds
on the victim's sternum.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.241
The, uh, anterior aspect
to be precise.

27:25.277 --> 27:26.776
What are you-- a doctor?
No.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.652
But I work with one.
Top of her field actually.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.281
And she and her team say
that the metal you use

27:31.316 --> 27:34.217
matched the particulates
they found in the bone.

27:34.252 --> 27:35.819
I've made hundreds
of those sculptures.

27:35.854 --> 27:36.853
I made one for Randall
two years ago

27:36.888 --> 27:38.521
as a birthday gift.
A gift...

27:38.557 --> 27:41.725
that's conveniently disappeared.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.360
Now, you use a, uh, Kobashi

27:43.395 --> 27:46.296
8.9-inch saw blade on
your sculptures, right?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.964
Because that's the same
blade that was used

27:48.000 --> 27:49.165
to dismember the victim.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.734
Yeah, that's
a very common blade.

27:50.769 --> 27:53.136
So, that's a coincidence, right?
Totally.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.504
Well, here's another
coincidence.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.039
Randall was murdered soon after

27:56.074 --> 27:57.440
you got back into town.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.344
Couldn't handle it, could you?

28:01.380 --> 28:04.914
Being replaced by
another grad student.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.182
I told you.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.584
I got over it.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.819
Not before you trashed his lab,

28:09.855 --> 28:12.088
and got booted out of school.
That was the best thing

28:12.124 --> 28:13.390
that ever happened to me.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.691
Running Randall's
experiments

28:14.726 --> 28:17.060
made me angry and anxious.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.495
Making art is freeing
and cathartic.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.497
Well, I hear that murderers
sometimes say

28:20.532 --> 28:23.199
killing people is pretty freeing
and cathartic, too.

28:23.235 --> 28:26.603
So, where were you on the night
of the 22nd, Victoria?

28:26.638 --> 28:27.937
I was driving

28:27.973 --> 28:30.607
to a craft fair,
in Fredericksburg.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.075
So if that's when he died,

28:32.110 --> 28:33.710
I couldn't
have done it.

28:33.745 --> 28:36.012
Can anybody verify that?

28:37.449 --> 28:39.549
You might want to call
your attorney because, uh,

28:39.584 --> 28:42.952
things are really not looking
good for you right now.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.223
I heard the techs found
more remains.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.691
Yes, in the dump.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.693
The right ulna, radius,
tibia and fibula.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.695
Not much more of him
left to find.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.697
Which is good
because they won't be able

28:54.733 --> 28:56.132
to hold Victoria Andrews
without more proof.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.201
Has Angela had any luck
deciphering the figure

28:58.236 --> 28:59.669
from the bird-cam photo?

28:59.704 --> 29:01.104
Not yet.

29:07.612 --> 29:10.080
Is everything okay, Mr. Bray?

29:10.115 --> 29:12.248
Yes. I'm sorry.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.850
Are you sure?

29:13.885 --> 29:15.151
'Cause you seem upset.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.453
Is it your health?

29:16.488 --> 29:17.687
No. My health is fine.

29:17.722 --> 29:20.356
I'm in remission,
everything's good.

29:24.129 --> 29:25.895
If you need to get that....

29:25.931 --> 29:28.331
No, I'm at work,
and at work I work.

29:28.366 --> 29:31.234
I noticed abrasions on the distal end
of the radius we just found.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.902
Which I didn't think
was a big deal

29:32.938 --> 29:36.039
until I found similar abrasions
on the scaphoid.

29:36.074 --> 29:37.807
Those look like
groove marks.

29:37.843 --> 29:40.009
I thought it was just
animal predation,

29:40.045 --> 29:42.212
but after examining the radius
more closely,

29:42.247 --> 29:44.380
I knew it was just one piece
of the puzzle.

29:44.416 --> 29:48.518
If I put the scaphoid
together with the radius...

29:48.553 --> 29:50.086
I got a perfect fit.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.454
It forms an arc--
they do fit.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.022
It appears to be
a human bite mark.

29:53.058 --> 29:55.091
And judging by the curve

29:55.127 --> 29:57.026
and the size
of the dental arcade,

29:57.062 --> 29:58.661
the bite was made by a female.

29:58.697 --> 30:00.196
Victoria Andrews.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.499
I'll get a warrant
and pull her dental records.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.808
<i>So Victoria did it?</i>

30:11.843 --> 30:13.710
Look at the diastemata
of Victoria's incisors

30:13.745 --> 30:17.113
in relation to the dental
lacerations on the victim.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.581
Was I supposed to know
what you just said?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.150
No, you're just supposed to nod.

30:20.185 --> 30:21.718
Eventually she's gonna
tell you what it means.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.486
Well, the spaces between
Victoria's teeth are too wide

30:23.522 --> 30:25.688
for these marks
to have been left by her.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.124
See? I thought you guys would be
working much better by now.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.660
He does knows the pH of blood,
which is impressive.

30:30.695 --> 30:32.629
- I got a high "B" in my chem lab.
- That's great.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.297
So we can't tie Victoria
to the murder?

30:34.332 --> 30:36.065
Only circumstantially.
Okay. Anything else?

30:36.101 --> 30:38.434
Angela saw a female form
in the shadow

30:38.470 --> 30:40.703
and the dentition appears to be
from a woman.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.238
So, another jealous lover

30:42.274 --> 30:45.108
maybe, but that just puts us
back at square one.

30:45.143 --> 30:46.543
If you want me to help, I got
to finish this test first, okay?

30:46.578 --> 30:47.911
Okay.

30:47.946 --> 30:50.046
This road sign means...?

30:50.081 --> 30:52.081
Oh, I know this one.
It's A) Divided highway begins.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.317
No, it's not.
It's "Divided highway ends."

30:54.352 --> 30:55.985
No.
Aubrey?

30:56.021 --> 30:57.754
I'm staying out of this one.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.522
Based on the directionality
of the arrows, I am correct.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.024
Okay, you're sure about this?
Yes.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.092
Then I'm gonna trust you
on this one.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.629
I'm sorry.
The correct answer was "B."

31:06.665 --> 31:08.665
You're supposed to be a genius.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.234
Officer Stop 'n Go is wrong.
Okay,

31:11.269 --> 31:12.569
would you like to argue
with an officer?

31:12.604 --> 31:13.570
Go ahead.
Well, he's wro...

31:13.605 --> 31:15.939
I'm never wrong.
You are at this instance.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.674
And I'm not going to forget it either.
Is this gonna turn into a fight?

31:17.709 --> 31:20.076
No, it's not going to turn
into a fight 'cause

31:20.111 --> 31:21.878
You know what? I'm going
to argue with Officer Stop 'n Go

31:21.913 --> 31:23.680
and you're going
to go catch a murderer.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.315
All right.
I still challenge it.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.683
I was right.
Okay, you're right.

31:26.718 --> 31:27.984
You're not-- you're wrong.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.419
What are you sitting here,
waiting for?

31:29.454 --> 31:30.920
She's all yours now.

31:30.956 --> 31:33.256
Good luck. Just nod.
Remember, nod. It helps.

31:33.291 --> 31:34.791
What are you looking at?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.595
<i>I used the time of death</i>
<i>you gave me</i>

31:38.630 --> 31:41.197
<i>to pull the correct footage</i>
<i>from the bird camera.</i>

31:41.233 --> 31:42.565
<i>By creating a</i>

31:42.601 --> 31:45.301
high-pass filter
with an adjustable pixel radius,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.104
I was able to remove
the low-frequency details

31:48.139 --> 31:50.540
while allowing
the more in-focus,

31:50.575 --> 31:52.575
high-frequency details
to remain.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.711
As if I needed
another reason to love you.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.381
Whoa.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.749
Wait a minute.

31:59.784 --> 32:02.485
That's Fairbanks' current
girlfriend, Tabitha.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.688
Yeah. This photo shows
her going into his house

32:05.724 --> 32:07.190
two hours before he was killed.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.759
We've been focusing
on the wrong jealous lover.

32:12.444 --> 32:15.523
We've got video of you
sneaking into Randall's house.

32:15.524 --> 32:17.523
So I wonder,
why would you do that?

32:17.559 --> 32:19.392
I swear, I'd never hurt Randy.

32:19.427 --> 32:20.994
His next door neighbor
said that she heard

32:21.029 --> 32:22.662
fighting a few minutes
after you got to the house.

32:22.697 --> 32:24.397
So, what was that
about, hmm?

32:24.432 --> 32:26.432
Victoria?
Victoria?

32:26.468 --> 32:28.428
An old lover surfaces,
maybe you get jealous?

32:28.428 --> 32:31.070
Of her?
Please. She's crazy.

32:31.106 --> 32:32.672
Randy hated her.

32:32.707 --> 32:35.208
So maybe it wasn't about sex.

32:35.243 --> 32:36.909
These journals contain
the studies

32:36.945 --> 32:39.178
that Fairbanks conducted
with Victoria.

32:39.214 --> 32:40.583
So?

32:40.608 --> 32:42.550
So she was just
a grad student like you,

32:42.550 --> 32:45.051
but Fairbanks gave her credit
on all the studies.

32:45.086 --> 32:47.854
These are the studies that
Fairbanks conducted with you.

32:47.889 --> 32:49.689
Your name doesn't appear
anywhere.

32:49.724 --> 32:51.057
Randy had an ego.

32:51.092 --> 32:53.459
He decided to stop sharing credit.
Hmm.

32:53.495 --> 32:55.094
That must've made you mad.

32:55.130 --> 32:57.063
And even a nice person like you
can turn violent.

32:57.098 --> 33:00.199
Isn't that what your
last behavioral study was about?

33:00.235 --> 33:01.734
We weren't fighting
about credit,

33:01.770 --> 33:04.737
not specifically, and I swear,
when I left him,

33:04.773 --> 33:06.739
Randy was alive.

33:06.775 --> 33:10.143
I'm waiting for the part
where I believe you.

33:11.613 --> 33:13.579
Okay, look.

33:13.615 --> 33:15.048
I snuck into Randy's place,

33:15.083 --> 33:17.784
but it was only to spray
my perfume in his bedroom.

33:17.819 --> 33:19.185
Wow, jury's gonna love that one.

33:19.220 --> 33:20.687
Sorry to have wasted your time.

33:20.722 --> 33:24.090
I was conducting a study
of my own on Randy,

33:24.125 --> 33:27.593
to see if subconscious
olfactory reminders of me

33:27.629 --> 33:29.562
would make him more attentive.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.301
He caught me in his bedroom,
and we fought,

33:35.336 --> 33:39.539
because I was conducting a study
without his approval.

33:39.574 --> 33:41.441
So he did want credit.

33:41.476 --> 33:42.508
Yes, who wouldn't?

33:42.544 --> 33:44.110
I worked my ass off for him,

33:44.145 --> 33:45.445
and somehow he thought
that saying,

33:45.480 --> 33:46.946
"I love you" was enough.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.316
I deserve to be acknowledged
for my accomplishments.

33:50.351 --> 33:52.251
Is this a confession,
'cause I should bring someone in

33:52.287 --> 33:53.953
to take this down.
No.

33:53.988 --> 33:57.323
I did not kill
Randall Fairbanks.

33:57.358 --> 33:59.425
We fought, and I left.

33:59.461 --> 34:02.095
And I never saw him again.

34:12.373 --> 34:13.672
Andie, what are you doing here?

34:13.708 --> 34:14.907
I'm supposed to be working.

34:14.943 --> 34:17.510
You know,
you can't sleep with me

34:17.545 --> 34:19.312
and dump me all in the same day.

34:19.347 --> 34:21.481
You just can't do it.

34:23.051 --> 34:24.984
Look, I-I'm sorry
I haven't answered your texts.

34:25.018 --> 34:27.085
Forget about me.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.722
I'm talking about you.

34:29.757 --> 34:31.157
You like me.

34:31.192 --> 34:32.692
A lot.
Yeah.

34:32.726 --> 34:34.260
I do, but that's not the point.

34:34.295 --> 34:36.228
Really?
There's another point?

34:36.264 --> 34:38.097
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that two people

34:38.132 --> 34:40.766
liking each other like this
is what everyone is looking for

34:40.802 --> 34:42.768
everywhere in the world
all the time.

34:42.804 --> 34:45.670
And we're lucky enough
to find it.

34:49.244 --> 34:51.978
So what gives, Wendell?

34:54.081 --> 34:57.283
What do you think?

34:57.318 --> 34:59.752
I mean, sure I'm
in remission now, but...

34:59.788 --> 35:01.554
Okay, if you're gonna do
the whole cancer boy thing,

35:01.589 --> 35:03.489
save your breath.
I'm an oncology nurse.

35:03.525 --> 35:05.658
I see people die every day.

35:08.029 --> 35:09.395
Yeah, but...

35:09.430 --> 35:11.030
I don't want to get close to you

35:11.065 --> 35:13.599
and then have you see me die.

35:21.309 --> 35:25.444
What I've learned
treating patients...

35:25.480 --> 35:27.680
death is just part of the deal.

35:29.384 --> 35:30.516
You know,

35:30.552 --> 35:34.453
we all come
with an expiration date.

35:34.489 --> 35:37.790
That doesn't scare me at all.

35:39.394 --> 35:40.693
And what makes you so sure

35:40.728 --> 35:42.762
you're gonna go
before me anyway?

35:42.797 --> 35:45.298
I had an aunt

35:45.333 --> 35:46.833
who went on a bike ride--

35:46.868 --> 35:48.501
healthiest woman in the world.

35:48.536 --> 35:50.870
She and her husband
were just pedaling along,

35:50.905 --> 35:52.939
laughing, madly in love,

35:52.974 --> 35:55.975
and then a tree branch fell
on her.

35:56.010 --> 35:57.476
Freak accident.

35:57.512 --> 35:59.912
Killed her on the spot.

35:59.948 --> 36:02.515
My Aunt Debbie.

36:02.550 --> 36:05.318
I can give you
her husband's number.

36:06.421 --> 36:07.653
You ask him

36:07.689 --> 36:09.989
if he would've been better off

36:10.024 --> 36:12.758
if they'd never gotten together.

36:24.038 --> 36:26.172
I don't know if I can do it.

36:29.043 --> 36:32.144
Sure you can.

36:34.315 --> 36:38.417
Just... maybe not alone.

36:50.064 --> 36:53.032
Is it okay if
we kiss here?

36:57.472 --> 36:58.871
Who cares?

37:06.748 --> 37:08.547
Mr. Bray,

37:08.583 --> 37:11.484
if you'd like
to keep your job...

37:11.519 --> 37:14.120
Of course, Dr. Saroyan.

37:15.390 --> 37:17.156
I'm almost done.

37:30.538 --> 37:31.837
Another delivery?

37:31.873 --> 37:33.306
Yup.
From a trash barge.

37:33.341 --> 37:36.008
I'm running the particulates
and trace now.

37:36.044 --> 37:38.778
And I already took X rays
for Wendell and Dr. B.

37:40.114 --> 37:42.248
There's a deep cut
on one of the fingers.

37:42.283 --> 37:45.851
Oh. Yeah, that's actually where
I found most of the trace.

37:45.887 --> 37:48.187
Uh, the first thing that
came up was antifreeze.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.523
Well, makes sense.
It was on a trash barge.

37:50.558 --> 37:52.858
Well, it would, if I
hadn't found antifreeze

37:52.894 --> 37:54.093
on the victim's right hand,

37:54.128 --> 37:56.529
which was found at a
different dump site.

37:56.564 --> 37:58.164
Are the left metacarpals
ready for us?

37:58.199 --> 37:59.665
Now you're
in a rush?

38:01.069 --> 38:03.436
Yeah, sorry about that.

38:03.471 --> 38:05.271
Not too sorry, I imagine.

38:05.306 --> 38:06.939
Okay,

38:06.975 --> 38:09.041
I clearly missed
something good.

38:09.077 --> 38:11.110
Anyway, I got some
X rays over there

38:11.145 --> 38:13.579
if you want to take a look
while you're waiting.

38:15.049 --> 38:17.016
There's an abrasion on
the second distal phalanx.

38:17.051 --> 38:18.884
Yes, the victim was cut.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.720
- Maybe by the sculpture?
- No, no.

38:20.755 --> 38:22.288
It was a different
metal. It's

38:22.323 --> 38:24.223
aluminum with less than
one percent manganese.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.192
It's what they
make cans out of.

38:26.227 --> 38:28.127
Um, it probably just
happened on the barge.

38:28.162 --> 38:30.329
Well, the curvature is
consistent with a can,

38:30.365 --> 38:32.031
But this abrasion is perimortem.

38:32.066 --> 38:33.265
Wait a minute, that
might actually explain

38:33.301 --> 38:34.400
the other particulates
that I found

38:34.435 --> 38:35.868
in the cut.
Listen to this.

38:35.903 --> 38:38.371
Salmon, sardines,
flax meal,

38:38.406 --> 38:40.906
chicken liver. That's
everything that you'd find

38:40.942 --> 38:43.609
in a can of cat food.
Except for antifreeze.

38:43.644 --> 38:45.378
Actually,
antifreeze tastes

38:45.413 --> 38:47.179
sweet to animals. It's the
reason so many household pets

38:47.215 --> 38:48.681
consume it and die.
Which means

38:48.716 --> 38:50.850
that someone was trying
to poison Skinner.

38:50.885 --> 38:53.919
Well, we need to
examine him. Perhaps he

38:53.955 --> 38:57.156
scratched or bit the killer.

38:57.448 --> 38:59.001
Congratulations, driver.

38:59.002 --> 39:00.901
Officer Stop 'n Go gives you
the green light to get back on the road.

39:00.902 --> 39:01.627
Ha, ha!

39:01.662 --> 39:04.864
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about, yeah! Thank you!

39:04.899 --> 39:07.800
Why are you acting like your
hockey team the Finers won?

39:07.835 --> 39:10.302
Not the Finers, they're
the Flyers. That doesn't matter. Look,

39:10.338 --> 39:12.338
Officer Stop 'n Go passed me.
Congratulations, driver.

39:12.373 --> 39:14.073
What do you say we go
for a drive to celebrate?

39:14.108 --> 39:16.242
Well, right now I'd rather
arrest a murderer

39:16.277 --> 39:18.277
who will also be charged
with animal cruelty.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.231
You were looking for me?

39:19.255 --> 39:21.597
Yes, it looks like someone tried
to poison the cat.

39:21.716 --> 39:22.414
Skinner?

39:22.438 --> 39:23.550
Yes.
So what's a skinny cat have

39:23.551 --> 39:25.551
to do with anything here?
It's actually not the cat,

39:25.586 --> 39:27.386
it's the bird the cat ate.
What bird did he eat?

39:27.422 --> 39:29.455
I'm sorry, are you following this?
Sure, we've developed

39:29.490 --> 39:30.623
a shorthand.

39:30.658 --> 39:32.291
We have?
Apparently. So,

39:32.326 --> 39:33.726
what did Skinner eat?
I found

39:33.761 --> 39:35.061
bone fragments
in his stomach.

39:35.096 --> 39:37.663
You cut open Skinner?
What? No! No.

39:37.698 --> 39:39.965
I... I took X rays.

39:40.001 --> 39:42.401
The bones were from
a Bewick's Wren.

39:42.437 --> 39:44.637
All right, you sound very excited by this.
Bewick's Wren is on

39:44.672 --> 39:46.005
Maryland's endangered list.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.339
Oh, my God.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.575
You're kidding.
Right? It makes sense,

39:49.610 --> 39:50.843
doesn't it?
Yes. I don't know

39:50.878 --> 39:52.244
if I like the shorthand thing.

39:52.280 --> 39:54.180
I think we just solved
the case, Agent Booth.

39:54.215 --> 39:55.648
I'll get her
dental records and see if the

39:55.683 --> 39:57.083
bite mark is a match.
You should be

39:57.118 --> 39:59.385
pleased with yourself
for picking Aubrey.

39:59.420 --> 40:00.786
He's quite
competent.

40:00.822 --> 40:02.955
Was that just a compliment?
I tell you what,

40:02.990 --> 40:05.057
why don't you just enjoy
the spotlight for now

40:05.093 --> 40:07.226
and go finish the case, huh?

40:09.764 --> 40:12.264
You wouldn't let anything happen
to your precious birds,

40:12.300 --> 40:14.600
would you?
This is silly.

40:14.635 --> 40:16.402
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

40:16.437 --> 40:18.204
Well, it isn't
a dead fly

40:18.239 --> 40:20.606
we're talking about.
It's Randall Fairbanks.

40:20.641 --> 40:22.541
As a lover
of ornithology, you're

40:22.577 --> 40:24.777
well-versed in animal
behavior. You studied

40:24.812 --> 40:27.113
the migration patterns
of Randall Fairbanks

40:27.148 --> 40:29.115
so you could poison his cat
when he wasn't home.

40:29.150 --> 40:29.792
No. No, no.

40:29.816 --> 40:31.318
But what you didn't know
was that the professor

40:31.319 --> 40:32.685
was on a sabbatical,
which is why

40:32.720 --> 40:34.620
he caught you
trying to kill Skinner.

40:34.655 --> 40:36.755
He grabbed the can
of poisoned cat food

40:36.791 --> 40:39.809
from you and cut his hand
in the process.

40:39.833 --> 40:41.512
No, I-I don't think
that's what happened.

40:41.513 --> 40:42.394
During the struggle

40:42.430 --> 40:44.130
you bit him. That bite mark

40:44.165 --> 40:46.232
matches your dental records.
During the struggle

40:46.267 --> 40:48.567
you must've pushed him,
causing him to stumble

40:48.603 --> 40:51.604
backward and impale himself
on the garden sculpture.

40:51.639 --> 40:53.372
And then there's this.

40:53.407 --> 40:56.008
The saw that you used
to cut him up.

40:56.043 --> 40:58.477
The same saw you used
on your birdhouses.

40:58.513 --> 41:00.379
His blood is on the blade.
A child

41:00.414 --> 41:02.281
could prosecute this case

41:02.316 --> 41:05.518
and win, Ms. Von Mertens.

41:06.888 --> 41:10.523
How could I know that
he'd impale himself?

41:10.558 --> 41:12.291
Do you know
how many times

41:12.326 --> 41:16.061
I begged him to put
a bell on that creature?

41:16.097 --> 41:17.696
Would that have been so hard?

41:17.732 --> 41:19.365
I-Is that too
much to ask?

41:19.400 --> 41:22.001
One little bell?

41:22.036 --> 41:25.638
I was just trying to
protect the Bewick's Wren.

41:26.741 --> 41:28.674
They're so beautiful.

41:28.709 --> 41:31.544
There's really
nothing like them.

41:55.136 --> 41:56.936
Oh, Bones, I almost forgot.

41:56.971 --> 41:59.672
I got you a present.

41:59.707 --> 42:01.273
Oh.

42:01.309 --> 42:03.976
Something so you can study up
on your traffic signals.

42:04.011 --> 42:05.678
Very funny.

42:05.713 --> 42:08.247
I-I apologize for giving you
incorrect information.

42:08.282 --> 42:09.748
You know what,
I tell you what,

42:09.784 --> 42:11.383
I have been looking
for something

42:11.419 --> 42:14.153
to hold over your head
for years. So, you know what?

42:14.188 --> 42:15.821
I have to thank you.

42:17.425 --> 42:19.291
However, unlike you,
I have never

42:19.327 --> 42:21.126
received a citation
for speeding.

42:21.162 --> 42:23.462
That's because you drive
like a grandma.

42:23.497 --> 42:26.398
Face it, Booth-- I'm a much
better driver than you are.

42:26.434 --> 42:29.301
Says who?
The State of Virginia, for starters.

42:29.337 --> 42:31.337
So it's official.
Okay, so if that's a challenge,

42:31.372 --> 42:33.739
I hope it ends in a super cool
drag race.

42:33.774 --> 42:35.207
Oh, that sounds dangerous.

42:35.243 --> 42:36.842
Well, it's not
if you're behind the wheel.

42:36.877 --> 42:38.344
Instead of <i> The Fast</i>
<i>and the Furious,</i> it'd be

42:38.379 --> 42:40.512
<i>The Slow and the Serious.</i>

42:42.350 --> 42:46.318
I did once drive 83
on an interstate.

42:46.354 --> 42:47.428
Oh...

42:48.770 --> 42:50.630
Okay, that's it,
you're under arrest.

42:50.632 --> 42:52.651
Stand up, turn around,
hands behind the back.

42:52.652 --> 42:53.077
Booth.

42:53.078 --> 42:55.695
No, I got to report it, the
law's the law in Virginia.
