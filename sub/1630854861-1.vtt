WEBVTT

01:27.170 --> 01:29.410
- So annoying.
- That's what I'm talking about.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.594
- Oh, my gosh.
- We missed you so much.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.304
Love you all.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.782
- Are you in trouble?
- Tsk.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.213
All these came for you,
and one of 'em has a notice to appear.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.924
- So, what's that all about?
- I don't know.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.154
Smells good in there.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.222
Why are you here?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.769
- Ma, I need my birth certificate.
- Why?

04:30.312 --> 04:31.938
I wanna be a marine.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.643
If you hear me, gimme an amen.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.228
Amen!

05:11.311 --> 05:13.313
Hallelujah! Glory to god!

05:25.492 --> 05:27.494
Hmm, no. Wait, hold on.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.667
Really, ma?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.170
Hm, sit your ass down, right here.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.150
Marines.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.866
Sure. Okay.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.425
No, no, no.

06:52.287 --> 06:56.791
You have no idea
how hard these past five years have been.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.303
You always said I would hit a wall.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.013
Hey.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.936
Something has to change.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.021
What about your lifestyle?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.697
I need you to help me.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.450
Please.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.874
I made peace with losing you.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.424
Never mind.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.929
This little... piece of paper.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.225
It's all I have left of...

08:40.145 --> 08:42.355
The dream I held for you.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.570
If you don't come back
the son I gave birth to...

08:50.196 --> 08:52.323
Consider this certificate void.

10:07.398 --> 10:11.903
In the two years since president bush
declared victory in the war in Iraq,

10:11.986 --> 10:14.781
the al-qaeda insurgency rages on.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.491
At least 30 people have died

10:16.574 --> 10:20.912
following an insurgent suicide bomb attack
at a restaurant in Baghdad.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.499
Us military leaders
struggle to maintain control

10:24.582 --> 10:26.459
- and are requesting...
- Hmm.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.545
I wanted to give you this.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.674
It still works.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.391
You see this shit?

10:43.893 --> 10:46.938
And more than 15 men wounded
or injured in this attack,

10:47.021 --> 10:50.942
including several American servicemen
who were on patrol there.

10:51.025 --> 10:52.193
Ellis.

10:54.946 --> 10:58.950
From one old queen to a young one.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.541
- You don't have to do this.
- What am I supposed to do?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.129
You're...

11:12.130 --> 11:13.131
Young.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.970
And beautiful.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.061
You're so, so smart.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
You could be anything you wanna be.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.747
Now, you and I both know that's not true.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.340
I hope to never see you
in here again, kid.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.014
And you better not keep in touch.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.712
What made you sign up
for the war, then?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.649
They went and told a nigger
if I signed up,

12:36.673 --> 12:38.216
they'd give a motherfucker 30 racks.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.694
They gave you a signing bonus?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.679
Ain't gettin' rich
cuttin' a nigger around my way,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.882
but I will killing a couple niggers
for old uncle Sam.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.771
Hey, say, man.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.574
You gonna eat that?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.693
Oh, yeah.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.529
Oh, man, what'd you get?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.965
It's almost like
they know a nigger.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.323
Got my oatmeal cream puff, boy.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.127
You hungry?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.509
You're not?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.468
Let's move! Come on!
What are you looking at?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.531
- Get off the bus!
- Move!

14:07.555 --> 14:09.724
If your shirt's untucked,
you will tuck it in.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.160
- Say, "aye, sir!"
- Move!

14:14.228 --> 14:15.563
Let's go!

14:21.527 --> 14:23.988
Sir, yes, sir.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.424
Let's go!

14:27.450 --> 14:29.535
These are my boys.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.372
Drill ad rosales and kill ad Brooks.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.666
Now...

14:35.750 --> 14:37.877
Look down at your feet on my footprints.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.298
This is called the position of attention.

14:43.299 --> 14:47.345
Heels stuck together
at a 45 degree angle, knees slightly bent.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.430
My purpose over the next three months

14:49.514 --> 14:52.600
is to see that the strongest of you
move foward to join the fight.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.936
Aye, sir!

14:55.019 --> 14:58.231
I will break you. I promise.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.069
I'll be the nightmare that keeps you
from closing your eyes at night.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.948
You will think to yourself,
"god, does this motherfucker hate me?"

15:07.031 --> 15:09.867
Yes! I hate recruits.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.578
But I love marines.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.080
Aye, sir.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.167
- Recruit ismail.
- Here, sir!

15:18.251 --> 15:19.311
Recruit Franklin.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.796
Have you ever been convicted of a felony?

15:31.722 --> 15:35.017
- Yes, sir!
- Have you been convicted of a felony?

15:35.101 --> 15:37.645
Are you a communist? Are you a homosexual?

15:37.728 --> 15:39.998
Have you recently smoked marijuana?
Do not look at me, recruit!

15:40.022 --> 15:41.458
Have you ever been in a terrorist cell?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.276
- No, sir!
- Well, what about 9/11?

15:44.485 --> 15:49.157
Nobody, and I mean nobody, asked you!
On your fucking face, recruit!

15:49.240 --> 15:50.450
- Say "aye, sir!"
- Castro!

15:50.533 --> 15:51.617
- Castro!
- Here, sir!

15:54.036 --> 15:56.390
Ever been convicted of a felony?
Are you a communist?

15:56.414 --> 15:57.999
Sixteen, fifteen,

15:58.082 --> 16:00.251
fourteen, thirteen, ho...

16:00.334 --> 16:04.338
- I know you, don't I, boy?
- Yes, sir!

16:04.422 --> 16:06.883
You served with this recruit's father
in desert storm.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.136
- Do you have a problem with me, label?
- I don't have a problem, sir.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.929
This recruit is very chillaxed, sir.

16:13.389 --> 16:17.518
I don't give a fuck
who your father is, recruit.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.479
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.731
- Aye, aye, sir!
- Aye, aye, sir!

16:21.814 --> 16:25.026
Ever been convicted of a felony?
Are you a communist?

16:25.109 --> 16:28.446
Have you recently smoked marijuana,
or ingested other narcotics?

16:28.529 --> 16:32.408
Are you in a terrorist cell? Are you now,
or have you ever been a homosexual?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.160
No, sir!

16:34.243 --> 16:36.162
Ever been in a terrorist cell?

16:38.247 --> 16:40.082
Say, "I love you, goodbye."
Hang up the phone.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.477
You! I'm talking to you!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.419
- Hang up the phone.
- You're next!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.272
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone. Gimme the...

16:45.296 --> 16:47.423
Gimme the phone! Gimme the phone!

16:47.507 --> 16:50.218
It's bullshit they make us guys
choose between our girlfriends

16:50.301 --> 16:51.581
and our moms, right?

16:51.636 --> 16:54.138
- Who you calling?
- My girl.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.017
Castro.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.978
Ellis French.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.188
Next.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.832
Turn around and go,
get out of here!

17:06.692 --> 17:10.279
How was your boyfriend?
Move! Move!

17:10.363 --> 17:11.882
You've reached Inez French.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.634
I'm not available
to take your call right now,

17:13.658 --> 17:16.118
- but if you leave me a message...
- You're done!

17:16.202 --> 17:18.955
Hey, baby.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.500
I made it to boot camp... safe.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.672
I can't really talk right now, so...

17:27.755 --> 17:29.549
I'll write you soon.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.888
Next! Hang up the phone. Next!

17:36.847 --> 17:39.368
I'm... I'm just gonna try one more time.
She probably stepped away...

17:39.392 --> 17:40.601
You only get one.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.442
- Come on.
- Move out! Move your ass!

17:43.479 --> 17:44.814
Come on, asshole!

17:44.897 --> 17:48.234
Make your call!
Get your ass up here.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.318
Next!

17:49.402 --> 17:50.945
When you are finished,

17:51.028 --> 17:53.406
put your belongings
in the little brown bag.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.701
Write your last form
with black marker and line up!

17:56.784 --> 17:58.327
- Aye, sir!
- Louder!

17:58.411 --> 17:59.412
Aye, sir!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.747
Don't you forget that last necklace.
I want that chain!

18:01.831 --> 18:04.208
That's my chain!
Don't forget about it, boy!

18:06.836 --> 18:08.671
This ain't your uncle's barbershop.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.214
This is recruit cuts.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.174
You will stand at attention.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.010
That means feet at a 45.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.178
Feet at a 45. And your face,

18:16.262 --> 18:18.472
and eyes straight front.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.855
Couple of best fucking friends.
A regular Zack Morris and ac. Slater.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.315
Is that what we fucking got here?

18:27.398 --> 18:30.818
Is my name fucking principal belding?
Is that my fucking name?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.212
- No, sir!
- What's so funny, recruit?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.947
You think I'm funny? Is this
a fucking clown show to you?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.324
Push ups. Say "aye, sir!"

18:36.407 --> 18:38.826
- Yes, sir!
- Go, go, go, go!

18:38.909 --> 18:41.370
On your fucking face! Let's go! Ten!

18:41.454 --> 18:43.205
One, two, three!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.791
One... all the way up! One, two, three!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.232
Mama, why can't you see?

19:10.316 --> 19:13.527
Mama, why can't you see?

19:13.611 --> 19:16.614
What this corps has done for me?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.492
What this corps has done for me?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.204

Even numbers to the right!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.077
Move!

20:47.788 --> 20:50.791
French, you're not gonna
fuck up my goddamn formation.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.170
Third squad, hold steady.
You're the base of this movement.

20:54.253 --> 20:57.214
Third squad, hold tight.
That means you, goddamn it!

20:57.298 --> 20:59.341
Aye, sir!

20:59.425 --> 21:01.844
Are you looking to disappoint
my senior drill instructor?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.388
On yourface, recruit! Everyone! Now!

21:04.472 --> 21:07.016
Caterpillar. Move, move!

21:13.439 --> 21:14.857
Push up!

21:16.609 --> 21:21.030
I can't hear you, you little
slithering snakes that sound like sissies.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.663
Come on, French. Push up!

21:33.709 --> 21:36.170
- You have scoliosis?
- No, sir.

21:36.253 --> 21:39.590
- What's wrong with your back?
- Nothing, sir!

21:39.673 --> 21:40.674
Push up!

22:04.532 --> 22:06.742
Battalion pft is in 15 minutes.

22:10.955 --> 22:11.956
Here you go.

22:13.374 --> 22:14.959
Thanks.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.461
Hey. We got this.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.259
Oh, I put in everything I got.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.344
It's driving me crazy, man.

22:31.141 --> 22:34.645
- Come on, you got it.
- 92, 93, 94, 95.

22:34.728 --> 22:35.729
Let's go, Harvey.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.358
Ninety-nine, hundred!

22:48.993 --> 22:51.787
Almost there, recruit!
Almost there!

23:12.850 --> 23:14.727
Yes, yes.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.813
Yeah, no worries, man.
I got you on those pull-up bars.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.032
- Ready, recruit?
- On up, French.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.511
Come on, man.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.995
All right.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.581
Go. Go!

23:37.917 --> 23:39.084
All right.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.921
Harvey trying to make
his grandpappy proud.

23:42.004 --> 23:45.174
Harvey, you gonna let French
steal squad leader from you?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.176
No, sir!

23:47.259 --> 23:50.179
- Get up there.
- Sixteen, seventeen...

23:50.262 --> 23:54.308
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

23:54.391 --> 23:56.852
You're done, recruit. Perfect score.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.689
Unless French here decides
he wants to try to tie your ass.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.775
Come on, dawg.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.157
Oh!

24:11.283 --> 24:12.910
To be a good marine

24:12.993 --> 24:16.956
means to know thyself
and seek self-improvement.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.626
French.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.128
You pushed yourself
past your limits today.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.298
Feel proud, recruit.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.593
Harvey.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.763
You're our squad leader.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.481
Good riddance.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.948
- Wash your right arm right now.
- Aye, sir!

24:51.031 --> 24:53.951
- Wash your left arm right now!
- Aye, sir!

24:54.034 --> 24:55.536
You eyeballing me, French?

25:00.874 --> 25:02.543
Wash your right butt cheek.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.005
And your left butt cheek.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.466
Slower.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.386
Here. Let me.

26:04.146 --> 26:05.856
You fucking kidding me, French?

26:07.483 --> 26:08.859
This nigga got a hard on.

26:10.861 --> 26:11.904
Shit.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.365
Get out of here, French.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.007
French?

26:32.091 --> 26:35.594
You're gonna be the last one to leave
the head. And that's a direct order.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.600
Senior drill instructor,
I respectfully request a moment.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.605
- We can't just leave him here.
- Request denied.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.366
Carry on, gentlemen.

27:23.725 --> 27:24.726
Hold him.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.901
Ahh!

27:38.657 --> 27:40.284
Fuck!

28:40.761 --> 28:41.762
Look, French.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.126
We just don't feel comfortable
with you around us anymore.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.437
French, just move already.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.149
Uh, it'd just be...
It'd be easier for everyone, all right?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.574
Go ahead, nigga.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.422
Figure it out, French.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.133
The longer you take,
the less time we have to eat.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.200
Rt&t!

29:45.284 --> 29:47.035
Reach out and touch someone!

29:47.119 --> 29:49.079
Recruits, recruits, reel it up!

29:51.540 --> 29:53.709
Back the fuck up,
before I back you up, boy.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.339
French, stand still.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.509
Go on, get the fuck off, I say.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.013
Did anyone tell you
to get out of line, recruit?

30:06.096 --> 30:07.931
And did anyone tell you to talk, recruit?

30:08.015 --> 30:10.017
Jesus Christ! You must wanna get smoked.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.019
Let's go, green, let's go!

30:16.982 --> 30:18.608
Chow's over.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.820
Nobody eats!

30:21.903 --> 30:23.989
Everybody file out!
We're going to the pit.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.741
Let's go! Move! Move!

30:25.824 --> 30:27.242
- Say, "aye, sir!"
- Aye, sir!

30:29.828 --> 30:31.663
Move! Move!

30:31.747 --> 30:33.415
This generation...

30:33.498 --> 30:35.917
You can't stand still
to save your life, can you?

30:37.294 --> 30:39.546
He asked you a question, recruit!

30:39.629 --> 30:40.881
Sir!

30:40.964 --> 30:43.675
This recruit can't stand still

30:43.759 --> 30:45.653
when his fellow recruits
are pushing him around, sir.

30:45.677 --> 30:46.928
Halt.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.099
Squat

30:51.183 --> 30:54.478
- squat! Say, "aye, sir!"
- Aye, sir!

30:56.730 --> 30:59.358
Squat there
and feed the sand fleas.

30:59.441 --> 31:01.443
Fonnard march.

31:02.778 --> 31:05.489
Platoon, halt.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.578
Feed it, French. Feed it, feed it.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.667
Don't you shake. Did I tell you to shake?

31:20.670 --> 31:21.963
Eat it, French.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.467
What, sir?

31:28.178 --> 31:30.722
Did you just ask him a question?

31:39.523 --> 31:42.275
- Back in formation, French.
- Aye, sir!

31:42.359 --> 31:44.694
This ain't a lounge show!
Move, French, go!

31:44.778 --> 31:46.154
Faster! Faster!

31:46.238 --> 31:48.949
Fonnard march!

31:49.032 --> 31:50.575
Left, right, left.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.245
- Double time march!
- Faster!

31:59.418 --> 32:00.502
Aye, sir!

32:08.385 --> 32:11.012
Tsk. I notice you don't have much to say.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.307
You can talk, can't you?

32:14.391 --> 32:16.893
Sir, this recruit hates
public speaking, sir.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.942
- Hand me your weapon, recruit.
- Aye, sir.

32:26.695 --> 32:27.946
All clear, sir.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.993
- I don't like your voice.
- Aye, sir!

33:00.812 --> 33:01.813
Received, sir!

33:04.983 --> 33:06.943
Lights! Lights! Lights!

33:07.027 --> 33:08.153
Aye, sir!

33:22.959 --> 33:24.294
Push!

33:24.377 --> 33:26.606
Keep those weapons
two inches above the deck. Two inches!

33:26.630 --> 33:29.066
- Aye, sir! Aye, sir!
- Two inches above the deck.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.801
Pain is not an excuse
for lack of discipline.

33:31.885 --> 33:34.471
In war, there is no time to be hurting.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.431
- Aye, sir!
- Pain...

33:36.515 --> 33:38.600
Is weakness leaving the body.

33:39.476 --> 33:42.854
Come on. Do it like that.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.898
Inspection, arms.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.858
Three...

33:46.942 --> 33:49.152
Four...

33:49.236 --> 33:51.530
Then push up. Five...

33:51.613 --> 33:54.699
Six, seven.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.576
- Well done.
- Aye, sir.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.495
- Go from the top.
- Thank you, sir.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.457
One, tick-tick two,
tick-tick three,

34:02.541 --> 34:06.127
tick-tick four, tick-tick five,
tick-tick six...

34:06.211 --> 34:08.922
Wipe that smile off your face.
Warrior face.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.443
If you're lucky enough to see combat,

34:12.467 --> 34:14.227
why is this weapon your best friend,
recruit?

34:14.261 --> 34:16.555
Because it's the thing that protects
the marine to my left

34:16.638 --> 34:17.931
and to my right, sir.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.352
Inspection, arms.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.397
One, tick-tick two, tick-tick three,

34:25.480 --> 34:27.899
tick-tick four, tick-tick five,

34:27.983 --> 34:30.610
tick-tick six, tick-tick seven.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.405
Thank you, sir.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.906
Zip it, French.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.971
Light! Lights! Lights!

35:41.264 --> 35:42.390
Aye, sir!

35:50.023 --> 35:53.234
This is the final
stage of swim qualification.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.489
You are to save a drowning man.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.826
A drowning man is the most dangerous.

36:02.535 --> 36:06.581
He will fight you,
even as you try to save his life.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.427
French.

37:42.510 --> 37:45.263
You better open your fucking eyes,
or I'm gonna smoke your ass.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.726
Okay.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.730
Back up, back up, back up.

37:56.566 --> 37:57.650
Come on.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.397
What did you think was going to happen?

38:19.464 --> 38:23.259
Stop whispering, French!
Speak like you got a goddamn dick.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.764
Who do I report this to? Sir?

38:29.349 --> 38:31.976
Just who the fuck you think
you're talking to, recruit?

38:40.235 --> 38:42.320
You can go and report everyone for...

38:44.072 --> 38:46.324
What you think happened here today.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.621
But the only person you're gonna hurt...

38:51.704 --> 38:54.541
- Is yourself.
- Gimme your keys.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.543
Come on.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.506
Come on. We're leaving.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.971
Why the fuck
aren't you doing your push-ups?

39:11.933 --> 39:13.935
You don't have to say anything.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.189
You wanna report it, I got your back.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.735
You've worked so hard.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.030
You've come this close.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.869
Next few weeks
are gonna breeze on by. I promise.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.537
Few weeks?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.290
In the next few...

39:37.000 --> 39:40.003
In a few weeks, I'll probably be dead.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.972
Boot camp is supposed to break you down.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.393
I'm here to build you up.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.480
It's the question...

39:59.564 --> 40:01.566
Every marine asks themselves.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.611
"Am I good enough to be here?"

40:07.614 --> 40:09.032
I think you've proven that you are.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.996
The real question is...

40:16.039 --> 40:17.874
Why do you wanna be here?

40:23.880 --> 40:26.132
I wanna be a marine.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.051
That's not good enough, French.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.015
Why did you work this hard
if you're just going to quit?

40:47.570 --> 40:50.239
I've been raising myself since I was 16.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.371
Twenty-five now.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.917
My mom?

41:03.711 --> 41:06.130
She won't even talk to me.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.640
Most of my friends are dead, or in jail.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.727
The streets was gonna kill me
no matter what, so...

41:19.811 --> 41:22.355
If I die in this uniform...

41:24.649 --> 41:27.318
I'm a hero. Somebody.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.576
Not just another...

41:37.787 --> 41:39.372
Homeless faggot.

41:57.807 --> 42:00.685
What would you guys eat right now
if you could have anything to eat?

42:00.768 --> 42:02.311
Shit, come on, nigga. All of it.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.107
Aw, man, I'd probably
get me one of them, uh...

42:06.190 --> 42:07.835
One of the big Mac heart attacks
from mcd's.

42:07.859 --> 42:08.901
Okay.

42:08.985 --> 42:11.571
Some bag of them fries from Wendy's.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.334
The-the little cherry slushies from, uh...

42:13.364 --> 42:15.366
- 7-Eleven.
- 7-Eleven.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.410
7-Eleven. 7-Eleven, fuck, yeah.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.370
That's trash.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.422
Yo, why would you
leave McDonald's for fries?

42:29.505 --> 42:32.300
That is true.
McDonald's does have the best fries.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.594
Nah, burger king has the best fries.

42:34.677 --> 42:37.263
Boy, you gonna crack us all.
This nigga says burger king.

42:37.346 --> 42:38.848
Yo, I don't... I don't understand.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.559
Are we... are we gonna pretend like laws
isn't a fucking psycho?

42:42.477 --> 42:44.538
I don't understand how we can let him
get away with this.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.898
I don't know how you guys don't see that.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.357
- I don't get it.
- Look.

42:48.441 --> 42:51.861
Unless you have somewhere better to be,
just shut the fuck up.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.406
I got a kid on the way.

42:57.241 --> 43:00.244
So the sooner we wrap this shit up,
the sooner I can take care of my people.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.375
- Shit.
- I'm with boles.

43:12.215 --> 43:14.801
Wendy's fries are better than McDonald's.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.113
- I knew I liked that nigga.
- Yeah.

43:18.137 --> 43:21.224
That's what I'm talkin' about, boy.
Black power! Yeah?

43:21.307 --> 43:24.769
Shut your cockhole screws,
you mothers of American tit-suckers!

43:24.852 --> 43:27.271
Mail call! In line! Now!

43:29.398 --> 43:32.026
Hey, birth defect Kyle.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.111
Eat that shit, Kyle.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.863
- Hey, birth defect rocky.
- Oh, shit.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.824
Oh, I love my brother.

43:37.907 --> 43:40.034
- Yo, what'd you get?
- Got some titties.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.453
Oh, shit, I want the one with the ass.

43:42.537 --> 43:45.665
- Hold on, nigga, I heard "titties".
- Here you go.

43:45.748 --> 43:46.749
This is you.

43:47.750 --> 43:50.229
I need me one of them Asian ones
with the little tight pussies.

43:50.253 --> 43:53.172
- There's no ass? You didn't get any ass?
- There you go. There she is.

43:53.256 --> 43:56.092
Aw, they got the bitches
suckin' on each other's titties and shit.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.678
These are wild.

44:00.555 --> 44:02.140
Anything for me?

44:03.808 --> 44:06.519
One something for you.
One something special.

44:06.602 --> 44:07.603
Let me see.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.441
Oh. That's right.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.363
You got duty, French.

44:18.447 --> 44:21.492
- Get your cover, and report.
- Aye, sir.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.404
Ahh! The fuck!

45:03.284 --> 45:05.077
Fuck.

45:07.914 --> 45:09.540
J“ where I come from j"

45:09.624 --> 45:12.251
J“ it's corn bread and chicken j“

45:12.335 --> 45:16.505
j“ where I come from
a lot of front porch sittin' j“

45:16.589 --> 45:20.760
j“ where I come from,
tryna make a livin' j“

45:20.843 --> 45:23.638
j“ and workin' hard to get to heaven j“

45:23.721 --> 45:25.431
j“ where I come from j“

45:25.514 --> 45:27.642
- hey. All right.
- Hey.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.727
I did not know you were a country boy.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.729
Yee-haw.

45:31.812 --> 45:32.855
Man.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.315
For a second,

45:34.398 --> 45:37.818
I thought French actually grew a pair,
and was gonna turn you in.

45:38.945 --> 45:41.948
Rosales, what did you say to him?
Because I'm with Brooks.

45:43.074 --> 45:46.202
I half expected to be spending
the night in the brig.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.082
You're not upset, are you?

45:53.751 --> 45:56.170
You and French
are just bosom buddies now, huh?

45:56.254 --> 45:59.632
I took an oath to make the weak strong.
So did you.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.927
Make them strong?

46:04.262 --> 46:06.681
My job is to make them invincible.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.600
Indestructible.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.771
There was no war on terror
when we were coming up.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.856
We went over to desert storm...

46:17.358 --> 46:19.110
Thought we were hot shit,

46:19.193 --> 46:21.779
winning the war in, what? Two weeks?

46:21.862 --> 46:23.030
Oorah!

46:24.490 --> 46:28.077
Ten years later, here we are.

46:29.870 --> 46:31.747
Nothing to show for it.

46:31.831 --> 46:34.792
Except 3,000 dead Americans,

46:34.875 --> 46:37.795
and the largest breach
in national security

46:37.878 --> 46:40.381
in the history of the United States.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.467
Our job is not to make marines.

46:45.052 --> 46:46.971
It's to make monsters.

46:50.016 --> 46:53.311
You really think we can turn
that faggot into a monster?

46:58.983 --> 47:01.527
You know, when I first got
this assignment, I looked up to you.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.656
You'd seen more combat than anyone I knew.

47:06.699 --> 47:08.242
I thought you were a real hero.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.954
Now I know you're just a bully.

47:12.038 --> 47:13.539
I fucking hate bullies.

47:13.622 --> 47:17.043
You watch your fucking mouth, rosales.

47:20.004 --> 47:22.882
I have picked up my buddy's guts
on foreign soil

47:22.965 --> 47:24.800
so that no one else has to.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.721
I got my four confirmed kills.

47:32.683 --> 47:36.687
If French earns the right
to be a marine on my watch?

47:38.606 --> 47:41.817
He's gonna be one bad motherfucker.

47:44.153 --> 47:45.571
Just like me.

47:49.909 --> 47:52.828
- A left, right, left
- A left, right, left

47:52.912 --> 47:56.499
- a left, right, left
- a left, right, left

48:06.675 --> 48:11.055
Tell your fellow recruits
the fundamentals of a good shot.

48:11.138 --> 48:12.890
Aye, sir.

48:12.973 --> 48:15.434
All right, recruits. What we want to do

48:15.518 --> 48:20.147
is get ourselves down into a good
and comfortable prone firing position.

48:20.231 --> 48:24.026
In the crevice of your shoulder,
eye down the sight.

48:26.195 --> 48:29.031
It's all about breathing.

48:29.115 --> 48:32.326
My grandfather told me that we got to name
our rifle after our first loves.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.955
Mine's named Mary Agnes.

48:36.038 --> 48:38.332
Butjust because
you give your weapon a name...

48:39.500 --> 48:43.379
Doesn't mean that you'll pull the trigger
when the enemy's downrange.

48:45.089 --> 48:48.259
Get your ass up. Get your ass up
and put the gun down. Get up!

48:50.094 --> 48:51.262
Set up as target.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.810
Your enemy
is going to look a lot like this.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.860
And do not let this uniform fool you.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.778
This recruit
refuses to train, sir.

49:07.862 --> 49:08.863
Excuse you?

49:10.281 --> 49:11.925
- This recruit refuses to train, sir.
- Excuse you?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.343
- This recruit refuses to train, sir.
- Excuse you?

49:13.367 --> 49:15.035
This recruit refuses to train, sir.

49:15.119 --> 49:17.955
- Insubordination will not be tolerated.
- Aye, sir.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.708
You join the mothers of america, label?
Is that it?

49:20.791 --> 49:22.835
A marine is built to obey commands.

49:22.918 --> 49:25.171
Recruit ismail
is part of our platoon, sir.

49:25.254 --> 49:28.334
You taught us to never aim our weapons
at something we do not intend to shoot.

49:29.592 --> 49:30.872
I will not pretend to shoot him.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.555
All right.

49:36.849 --> 49:38.142
This recruit...

49:43.898 --> 49:47.735
Get your ass up,
and get back over here. Now! Faster!
