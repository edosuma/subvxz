39:29.057 --> 39:30.794
Thank you.

39:30.826 --> 39:33.929
But I would like to
propose one last toast

39:33.963 --> 39:36.666
to our final mark...

39:37.905 --> 39:38.768
<i>El Doctore.</i>

39:38.800 --> 39:40.670
- Cheers.
- Cheers to that.

39:40.702 --> 39:43.736
All right, well, I'm going to...

39:43.771 --> 39:45.541
throw on the "Do Not Disturb"

39:45.574 --> 39:49.611
and go over the file of
the real Egan Award Winner.

39:50.162 --> 39:52.548
Something tells me she'll be a handful.

39:53.916 --> 39:55.585
Good job, guys.

39:59.722 --> 40:01.691
Ex-lovers... difficult.

40:01.724 --> 40:03.827
Even the fake ones.<i> Si?</i>

40:03.860 --> 40:05.762
No. No, it's fine.

40:05.795 --> 40:08.565
It's just... it's fine.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.383
Something's going on.

40:10.418 --> 40:12.236
No, what are you talking about?

40:12.271 --> 40:13.635
She's not being honest with you.

40:13.668 --> 40:15.804
She was somewhere with the car,

40:15.838 --> 40:18.675
and I saw her put
something in the trunk.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.744
And she lies about it to me.

40:21.911 --> 40:23.613
Are you sure?

40:25.623 --> 40:28.050
Get your face out of your ass.

40:40.929 --> 40:42.498
[knocking]

40:50.307 --> 40:51.007
Hold on!

40:53.394 --> 40:55.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:55.164 --> 40:56.432
Can we talk?

40:56.465 --> 40:59.068
- Yeah.
- All right.

41:03.072 --> 41:05.141
What's up?

41:05.755 --> 41:07.943
I just wanted to make sure

41:07.976 --> 41:10.545
everything's... okay.

41:10.579 --> 41:13.448
With... what?

41:13.481 --> 41:16.052
Us? The con? Global warming?

41:16.084 --> 41:18.119
Well, as far as we go, you know,

41:18.153 --> 41:19.455
I mean, I can job my job.

41:19.488 --> 41:21.357
- I think we're...
- Let's stop it.

41:21.389 --> 41:23.492
I can do my job. I can do my job, too.

41:29.127 --> 41:31.167
So everything's... cool?

41:31.200 --> 41:32.335
Yeah.

41:32.367 --> 41:34.237
Yeah, you just seem a little...

41:34.269 --> 41:36.405
Oh, man, look, we had sex, we fought.

41:36.438 --> 41:38.206
Your girlfriend showed up. Shit happens.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.075
We have a job to do.

41:40.108 --> 41:42.043
I'm okay. Are you okay?

41:42.077 --> 41:44.013
She's not really my girlfriend.

41:44.046 --> 41:45.348
Fine, she's not really. I'm not really.

41:45.380 --> 41:48.050
None of us are really. I get it. Really.

41:49.517 --> 41:53.021
Just wanted to check in, you know.

41:53.055 --> 41:55.057
- I appreciate that.
- All right.

41:55.090 --> 41:56.292
I'm good, I'm fine.

41:59.994 --> 42:01.639
Hey, Ez.

42:02.547 --> 42:04.516
Look, when this is all over,
we'll have a proper drink

42:04.549 --> 42:05.651
and have a chat.

42:05.685 --> 42:07.047
