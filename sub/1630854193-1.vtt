WEBVTT

01:31.358 --> 01:35.663
<i>And I am your host on</i>
The Lost Dimension.

01:35.697 --> 01:39.166
<i>Now, tell me brave viewers,</i>
<i>what scares you the most?</i>

01:39.199 --> 01:42.737
<i>Ghosts, demons, UFOs?</i>

01:42.770 --> 01:45.673
<i>Or you simply give yourself</i>
<i>the heebie-jeebies?</i>

01:45.707 --> 01:49.711
<i>Well, on tonight's episode,</i>
<i>a visitor comes knocking.</i>

01:49.744 --> 01:51.713
<i>Whether it'd be in human form?</i>

01:51.746 --> 01:54.916
<i>Well, you're gonna have</i>
<i>to hold your breath.</i>

02:01.923 --> 02:05.893
When I was a little boy,
I got food poisoning
at school one day,

02:05.927 --> 02:10.130
and I received permission
from one of my teachers
to go home early.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.901
And I come home...

02:13.935 --> 02:19.139
then I start hearing
strange noises coming from
upstairs in my parent's room.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.243
It scared me half to death,
you know, I turned white.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.881
I didn't know what to do, so...

02:28.448 --> 02:30.718
I went and got a big knife.

02:30.752 --> 02:33.821
Same knife my dad used to cut
the Thanksgiving Day turkey.

02:35.990 --> 02:41.863
And I could hear my mom's
screams getting louder and
louder,

02:41.896 --> 02:44.766
and I knew she was in trouble.

02:44.799 --> 02:47.167
It was like she was staring
death in the face.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.906
And so I opened
the bedroom door...

02:54.474 --> 02:58.680
then I saw a large man
in his ski mask

02:58.713 --> 03:02.249
fucking my mom.

03:02.282 --> 03:06.654
So, I started stabbing this guy
over and over and over.

03:06.688 --> 03:10.758
But... it was a mistake.

03:12.994 --> 03:14.696
A terrible mistake.

03:16.898 --> 03:19.901
It turns out the man that
I slaughtered was my own dad.

03:22.335 --> 03:23.638
They were role playing.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.712
Went home from food poisoning
and end up murdering
my own father.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.615
It was all very
embarrassing for me.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.485
But isn't life just
a one big embarrassment?

03:42.557 --> 03:47.562
I'll be honest,
your talent's more impressive
than your resume.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.429
Uh, thanks. Thank you.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.299
- Really great.
- Thank you.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.367
- A little about the role.
- Mmm.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.038
This scene takes place
in the character's childhood.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.875
This is one of the things
that led him down the path
to demon studies.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.545
Funnily enough,
it's actually based on
the very same demonologist

04:04.579 --> 04:08.649
- that performed
an exorcism on my wife.

04:08.683 --> 04:14.387
He's a tortured,
troubled man with a dark past.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.025
I need an actor to rip their
soul out and put it on screen,

04:18.059 --> 04:20.895
not just get high
and collect a paycheck.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.898
Well, I don't smoke. So...

04:23.931 --> 04:27.467
No. But, yeah, no,
I can do that...

04:27.502 --> 04:29.737
if you could cast me,
or whatever, in this. Or...

04:33.373 --> 04:34.776
Are we done?
Okay. Thank you.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.712
- Thank you.
- Clayton!

04:37.745 --> 04:40.982
Hey! Clayton!
Oh, my gosh, you fucking--

04:41.015 --> 04:42.817
- Donald! What's up, man?
- Studly!

04:42.850 --> 04:45.753
Doe-eyed motherfucker!
How are you, buddy? Mm!

04:45.787 --> 04:48.823
Life's good, dude.
Just, yeah, yeah, existing. You?

04:48.856 --> 04:49.991
- Existing?
- Yeah.

04:50.024 --> 04:54.095
Wow! The gratitude is just
exploding out of you right now.

04:54.128 --> 04:54.929
- Okay.
- No, I'm good man.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.731
- I'm fucking busy, dude.
- Yeah?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.066
Yeah. How are you though?
You're looking pretty svelte.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.468
You good? You malnourished?
You gettin' all your vitamins?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.671
- I'm worried.
- Yeah. I'm good, dude.
I'm good. Yeah.

05:03.704 --> 05:04.739
- Yeah?
- Donald, I'm good.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.708
Just, just, you know,
been auditioning a bunch.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.510
- Uh-huh.
- And then looking for...

05:09.544 --> 05:11.112
looking for some new headshots,
or something.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.581
- I'm sure.
- Do you have a phone call? Or--

05:13.614 --> 05:14.615
- No, no.
- What's going on?

05:14.649 --> 05:15.616
I, you know, it's crazy.

05:15.650 --> 05:16.951
I didn't know that you would--

05:16.984 --> 05:18.986
I mean, they were
going this way on this part.

05:19.020 --> 05:22.957
I'm just--
I sincerely hope that at some
point this year you do work.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.092
- Thanks, Donald.
It was good to see--
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

05:25.126 --> 05:27.595
No, for real, for real.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.363
This is just
a side racket for me.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.934
I make all my paper
on this fucking thing right now.

05:32.967 --> 05:36.103
And it is sad.
I need it. I want it.

05:36.137 --> 05:38.606
I have to do it.
I fucking love it, too.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.373
You know what I mean?
But you're a real fucking--

05:40.407 --> 05:41.776
You know, you're a real artist,
Clayton.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.811
- You are. You're a real artist.
- Yeah.

05:43.845 --> 05:46.013
I bet you fucking make yourself
cry in the bedroom, don't you?

05:46.047 --> 05:47.114
You do the bedroom break down.

05:47.148 --> 05:48.716
Do you? Is that what you do?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.151
Do you do the bedroom breakdown?

05:50.184 --> 05:52.887
- Hey!
- Hey! There she is.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.592
Wow. Oh, my God!
Looking tight as hell.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.960
You're lucky
you have a cute face.

05:58.993 --> 06:00.895
You're lucky
you have a boyfriend.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.134
<i>Hi, Clayton. It's Aunty Sherry.</i>

06:07.168 --> 06:10.470
<i>Wanted to check in</i>
<i>to see how you're doing.</i>

06:11.471 --> 06:13.040
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

06:13.074 --> 06:16.043
<i>I'm looking at photos of you</i>
<i>and your mom right now.</i>

06:16.077 --> 06:18.846
<i>Oh, this one is...</i>

06:18.880 --> 06:20.948
<i>You are so adorable.</i>

06:20.982 --> 06:24.151
<i>Such a little tiny pee-pee</i>

06:24.185 --> 06:27.154
<i>in the bathtub with your mommy.</i>

06:27.188 --> 06:29.090
<i>I visited your mom</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

06:29.123 --> 06:31.859
<i>Left some new flowers</i>
<i>by her grave.</i>

06:31.893 --> 06:35.630
<i>Remember that song</i>
<i>she always used to sing to you?</i>

06:35.663 --> 06:40.001
<i>Greensleeves?</i>
<i>Remember that song?</i>
<i>It was so fucking annoying.</i>

06:40.034 --> 06:42.670
<i>But you loved it. It was sweet.</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:48.042
<i>Anyway-- oh!</i>
<i>Your</i> NCSI <i>episode,</i>
<i>I watched it.</i>

06:48.075 --> 06:52.813
<i>It was terrific.</i>
<i>I am shocked how good it was.</i>

06:52.847 --> 06:55.650
<i>And I can't believe that they</i>
<i>cut you out of it entirely.</i>

08:17.298 --> 08:20.267
Okay. Very good. Very good.

08:20.301 --> 08:21.902
You guys, take your seats.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.106
Okie-dokie.

08:25.139 --> 08:29.243
I think the only one
who hasn't gone is Clayton.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.215
Do we have an odd number
of students?

08:34.248 --> 08:36.751
Don, my man,
you wanna do repetition

08:36.784 --> 08:38.652
one more time
for Clayton's sake?

08:40.154 --> 08:41.922
All right, gentlemen.
Come right this way.

08:47.161 --> 08:49.163
All right, Donald,
you're going to kick us off.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.733
First thing that comes to mind,
don't think too hard about it.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.535
And here we go.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.806
You're stupid.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.874
Really?

08:59.907 --> 09:00.975
Come on, Clayton.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.677
I'm stupid.

09:03.711 --> 09:07.148
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid.

09:07.181 --> 09:08.315
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid.

09:08.349 --> 09:09.617
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.818
- You're stupid.
- I'm--

09:10.851 --> 09:12.253
- You're stupid.
- I'm stupid.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.355
You're stupid!

09:14.388 --> 09:15.823
- Faster.
- You're a dick.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.124
Oh. You're dumb.

09:17.158 --> 09:19.060
- You're a fucking dick.
- You're dumb.

09:19.093 --> 09:20.694
- You're fucking short.
- You're dumb.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.630
- You're a short dick.
- Please repeat what he says.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.031
- You're dumb.
- You're dumb. I'm--

09:24.065 --> 09:25.766
- You're dumb.
- I'm dumb.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.234
You're scared.

09:27.268 --> 09:29.336
Repeat what he says, please!
I'm not--

09:29.370 --> 09:30.738
- You're scared!
- I'm not scared.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.239
- You're scared.
- I'm not scared.

09:32.273 --> 09:33.808
- You're scared. You're scared.
- I'm not scared.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.009
- You're scared.
- I'm not scared.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.711
- You're scared!
- I am not scared!

09:50.091 --> 09:53.894
<i>Don... dude... ship.</i>

09:56.764 --> 09:59.900
You think maybe you could, uh,
talk to your agent?

09:59.934 --> 10:02.369
See if he'd be down
to take a meeting with me?

10:02.403 --> 10:06.707
Oh. I mean,
that's gonna be a hard, Chippy.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.310
He's fucking real cocksucker.
You know that.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.113
I mean, you know how hard it is
for me to get him
on the fucking phone.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.182
I get it.

10:15.216 --> 10:19.787
So maybe you ask him
to come to my play next week,
see me in action.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.924
I mean,
you gonna comp him a ticket?

10:23.958 --> 10:26.127
What? No.
He'd have to pay full price.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.828
We have to pay
to rent the theater.

10:29.463 --> 10:33.234
You're coming
at me right now...

10:33.267 --> 10:37.705
it's like you're a baby seal
trying to swim in a world
full of sharks.

10:37.738 --> 10:41.008
And you're about to get clubbed
and get fucked raw.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.744
You're like a fucking
bottlenose dolphin here.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.980
I mean, I'm embarrassed.

10:46.013 --> 10:51.018
And I'm only telling you this
because you are so talented.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.254
But it's not about
your talent.

10:53.287 --> 10:59.226
It's about your height,
your weight, your face,
your temperament.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.929
Other than that...

11:04.498 --> 11:08.402
you are an amazing teacher.

11:15.276 --> 11:16.744
You know what Don?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.914
That kind of honesty...

11:23.384 --> 11:24.885
is what makes you great.

11:24.919 --> 11:27.021
- Oh, thank you.
- Keep using it.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.930
<i>Hey, Clayton, buddy,</i>
<i>it's your dad calling.</i>

11:35.963 --> 11:37.331
<i>Hope you're doing all right.</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:42.102
<i>Wanted to tell you Max and I</i>
<i>watched your</i> NCIS <i>episode.</i>

11:42.136 --> 11:44.305
<i>We didn't see you in it.</i>

11:44.338 --> 11:46.240
<i>Are you sure this was</i>
<i>the episode you were in?</i>

11:46.273 --> 11:48.209
<i>Just wondering if</i>
<i>they deleted your scene.</i>

11:48.242 --> 11:50.344
<i>I know that happens sometimes.</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:52.279
<i>You know, Max's son</i>
<i>might be able to get you a job</i>

11:52.313 --> 11:54.915
<i>as a junior broker</i>
<i>at his company.</i>

11:54.949 --> 11:57.351
<i>He said his company</i>
<i>is the next JP Morgan.</i>

11:57.384 --> 11:59.053
<i>No, it's Goldman Sachs.</i>

11:59.086 --> 12:00.522
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>
<i>Max has corrected me.</i>

12:00.555 --> 12:02.156
<i>It's Goldman Sachs.</i>

12:56.210 --> 12:57.244
Hello?

12:57.278 --> 12:58.245
<i>Hey, Clayton.</i>

12:58.279 --> 12:59.346
<i>I got Sean on the other line.</i>

13:00.981 --> 13:02.850
Okay. Uh, great.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.521
<i>Hey, Sean,</i>
<i>you're on with Clayton.</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:08.556
<i>Yo.</i>

13:08.590 --> 13:10.424
Yo. What's up, man?
How are you doing?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.126
I'm good. I'm good--

13:12.159 --> 13:14.261
- <i>Fuck!</i>
- You okay?

13:14.295 --> 13:16.130
<i>Nah, I just bent my knee.</i>
<i>Fuck, that hurt.</i>

13:16.163 --> 13:20.067
<i>Hey, so, I talked to the</i>
<i>director from</i> Psychic Highway.

13:20.100 --> 13:24.138
- Okay. And?
<i>- And he really liked you, man.</i>

13:24.171 --> 13:27.308
Ah, dude, that's...
that's great. That's great.

13:27.341 --> 13:28.610
<i>Yeah, I thought so, too.</i>

13:28.643 --> 13:30.244
<i>Anyway, they want you back in</i>

13:30.277 --> 13:32.012
<i>for a call back on Monday...</i>

13:33.615 --> 13:34.948
<i>11:00 a.m.</i>

13:35.883 --> 13:37.519
<i>You'll be there, yeah?</i>

13:37.552 --> 13:40.421
What are you nut--?
Of course, yes.
Of course, I'll be there.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.224
<i>Great, man.</i>
<i>Look, this first one was good,</i>

13:44.258 --> 13:46.360
<i>but this next one</i>
<i>you gotta crush.</i>

13:46.393 --> 13:48.962
Dude, I will. I will.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.264
<i>Good. No pressure.</i>

13:51.533 --> 13:52.534
<i>Peace!</i>

13:52.567 --> 13:53.568
All right. Thanks, man.

13:55.570 --> 13:58.405
Yeah!
Yes!

13:58.439 --> 14:00.374
Ah... fuck.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.533
Hello?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.502
Hello.

15:34.536 --> 15:35.537
<i>Hello.</i>

15:36.504 --> 15:38.071
Who is this?

15:38.105 --> 15:41.408
<i>I saw your ad</i>
<i>on the internet...</i>

15:43.778 --> 15:46.013
<i>about the demonologist.</i>

17:25.145 --> 17:26.380
Clayton Walker.

17:29.884 --> 17:33.521
I was doing
a little spring cleaning.
I didn't hear that door knock.

17:33.555 --> 17:37.659
- Please, come on in.
- Thanks.

17:37.692 --> 17:41.194
- Do you mind
to take off your shoes?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

17:43.865 --> 17:46.433
I'll just put
this beast away.

17:47.769 --> 17:51.539
Wow.
Cool place.

17:51.573 --> 17:56.343
Yes, it's been home to me
for many, many years now.

17:56.376 --> 18:00.380
Is it just...
is it just you here?

18:00.414 --> 18:01.448
Yes.

18:07.622 --> 18:09.089
Did you draw these?

18:09.891 --> 18:10.892
Oh, no, no.

18:10.925 --> 18:16.196
Those are based on
a 15th-century wood carving.

18:16.229 --> 18:20.267
Well, you see demons come in
many different shapes and forms.

18:22.904 --> 18:25.506
They can be invisible.

18:25.540 --> 18:30.678
Or they can be horrifying,
beastly creatures
that carry us away.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.717
Have you seen any of these,
the beasts?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.519
Oh, yes. Quite a few.

18:44.358 --> 18:50.163
Galvino... demon of desire.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.533
Shall we?

19:03.343 --> 19:06.614
Please, take a seat.

19:06.648 --> 19:08.616
Would you like a cup of tea,
Clayton?

19:08.650 --> 19:10.585
I was just in the middle
of making some.

19:10.618 --> 19:13.186
Um, yeah, sure.
Please. Thanks.

19:15.823 --> 19:19.226
Nothing like a nice cup of tea
after a long drive.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.193
Yeah.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.425
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.260
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

19:55.630 --> 19:56.898
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Oh.

19:56.931 --> 19:58.432
No, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.366
- No, it's okay.
- I didn't mean to.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.234
- Don't apologize.
- I'm sorry. I just--

20:01.268 --> 20:05.472
- Here. Clayton, take mine.
- Okay. Thank you.

20:05.506 --> 20:07.441
I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to spill on your--

20:07.474 --> 20:11.478
It's okay. It's okay.
Everything is fine.

20:11.512 --> 20:12.680
Yeah. No, I--

20:12.714 --> 20:15.917
- Everything is just fine.
- I'm just-- I'm really sorry.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.553
Don't apologize, Clayton.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.220
It's a sign of weakness.

20:24.058 --> 20:26.594
Why don't we
talk about your career?

20:26.627 --> 20:28.629
How long have you been acting?

20:30.297 --> 20:32.633
Uh, yeah, a while.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.503
Quite a while,
actually, almost 15 years.

20:35.536 --> 20:37.605
Wow.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.607
Well, I wish I'd seen
some of your work,

20:39.640 --> 20:42.309
but, unfortunately,
I haven't seen a movie in years.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.745
Yeah, well, even if you did,
you wouldn't--

20:43.778 --> 20:46.446
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have, really,

20:46.480 --> 20:47.882
seen me even if you did.

20:47.915 --> 20:50.518
Oh. Why do you say that?

20:51.953 --> 20:55.690
Because I haven't really
been in much.

20:55.723 --> 21:01.028
Well, I'm sure you've done
a lot of... amazing work
in the past 15 years.

21:01.062 --> 21:03.497
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure. I guess.

21:09.971 --> 21:12.840
All right, my love. Why don't we
talk about your family?

21:13.841 --> 21:15.475
Tell me about your father.

21:17.745 --> 21:19.547
Tell me about your mother.

21:23.785 --> 21:24.852
Is something wrong?

21:24.886 --> 21:27.588
Uh, no.
No, no, nothing's wrong.

21:27.622 --> 21:30.925
It's just I feel like I should
be the one asking the questions,
you know?

21:30.958 --> 21:34.996
Like, I'm here to learn what
it's like to do what you do.

21:36.898 --> 21:39.033
Oh. I see.

21:41.536 --> 21:45.305
Well, for the work
we're going to do today...

21:47.708 --> 21:49.476
I need you to trust me.

21:50.778 --> 21:52.713
I need to trust you.

21:53.948 --> 21:55.448
There can be no lies.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.385
There can be no mistrust
in this house.

21:58.418 --> 22:04.125
Or the ritual
that we will perform will have
very little chance of success.

22:10.031 --> 22:13.534
Ritual, um...

22:13.568 --> 22:17.505
I see that you experience
a great deal of self-doubt...

22:18.840 --> 22:20.440
Clayton Walker.

22:24.612 --> 22:29.349
Sweetheart...
it hasn't always been that way.

22:39.627 --> 22:40.895
I sense...

22:42.563 --> 22:44.665
I sense that something
happened to you.

22:49.503 --> 22:52.039
Something that made you
extremely vulnerable.

22:54.175 --> 23:01.015
But what I sense
is that evil spirits
have penetrated your soul.

23:01.048 --> 23:04.619
And I know that you can
feel this because as they've
become more powerful,

23:04.652 --> 23:07.855
you felt yourself
become more and more powerless.

23:07.889 --> 23:09.991
Now, they will
continue to do this

23:10.024 --> 23:13.393
until there is very little
Clayton Walker left.

23:17.632 --> 23:19.667
And then... what happens next?

23:26.040 --> 23:28.876
Well, that's not going to happen

23:28.910 --> 23:32.980
because the ritual
that we will perform

23:33.014 --> 23:35.683
is an expulsion of evil spirits.

23:35.716 --> 23:38.519
Sweetheart, just think of it
like a purification

23:38.552 --> 23:40.021
of your body and your mind.

23:42.123 --> 23:44.025
Uh, like, um... uh...

23:44.058 --> 23:45.593
An exorcism.

23:47.161 --> 23:48.562
On me?

23:48.596 --> 23:51.431
Yes. That-that's correct.

24:02.843 --> 24:07.148
Clayton, sweetheart,
you're gonna leave here with
a clear mind and a clear soul,

24:07.181 --> 24:11.218
and a very, very real sense
of the spirits that surround us.

24:11.252 --> 24:13.154
Now, I can't think of
a better way

24:13.187 --> 24:15.623
to prepare to play the role
of a demonologist.

24:15.656 --> 24:16.624
No?

24:19.260 --> 24:21.662
I'm just...

24:21.696 --> 24:24.632
Can I-- Can I use your bathroom
real quick, please?

25:03.004 --> 25:04.739
Shall we get started?

25:13.314 --> 25:14.749
Do you mind?

25:15.649 --> 25:16.751
Yeah.

25:26.260 --> 25:27.628
After you.

25:42.877 --> 25:47.281
So, this is where we will
perform the ritual...

25:48.282 --> 25:49.583
when you're ready.

25:50.351 --> 25:51.719
And when will that be?

25:53.621 --> 25:58.059
I'll need a day to prepare you.
So, tomorrow night?

26:00.194 --> 26:02.696
Wow. Okay.

26:02.730 --> 26:07.168
Uh... and what exactly
do we do at this ritual?

26:07.201 --> 26:10.271
Like, I know you said
we'd be, like,
extracting the evil spirits,

26:10.304 --> 26:11.739
like you said. But--

26:11.772 --> 26:14.175
Clayton, I've done this many,
many times.

26:15.976 --> 26:18.579
That's, uh...
That's blood, right?

26:20.848 --> 26:22.683
Yes, it is.

26:24.819 --> 26:25.853
Human blood?

26:27.388 --> 26:28.923
Yes.

26:31.425 --> 26:32.827
And goat.

26:34.061 --> 26:35.096
Right.

26:37.198 --> 26:39.100
Well, what do we do now?

26:41.168 --> 26:42.670
We eat.

26:47.074 --> 26:48.309
The goat?

26:58.052 --> 27:01.055
Yeah, I don't--
I don't really eat much
good home cooking these days.

27:02.323 --> 27:04.024
Well, a healthy diet

27:04.058 --> 27:07.194
is a key component
to a healthy mind.

27:07.228 --> 27:09.964
I guess that's why
my mind's always
running me wild then, huh?

27:09.997 --> 27:11.665
Or that and the demons.

27:18.139 --> 27:22.076
Wait, no, I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to....

27:22.109 --> 27:24.879
I'm not sure
this is going to work.

27:24.912 --> 27:28.048
No. I was just
trying to be funny, I guess.
Okay? It's just--

27:28.082 --> 27:30.050
Are you aware
that there are many,

27:30.084 --> 27:31.886
many people
who want nothing more

27:31.919 --> 27:35.222
than to ridicule
and berate me for what I do?

27:37.725 --> 27:42.229
Now, I'm... I'm certain that
you are who you say you are.

27:42.263 --> 27:44.899
But I am not certain
that you will be able to silence

27:44.932 --> 27:50.070
the preconceived notions
and doubts that obviously...
concern you.

27:55.876 --> 27:58.879
Look, I need this role.

27:58.913 --> 28:01.382
Okay? I'm-I'm...
I'm 35 years old.

28:01.415 --> 28:04.818
I'm unemployed
and I have 1,200 followers.
It's shit.

28:11.025 --> 28:12.026
Well...

28:13.894 --> 28:18.132
Jesus Christ
had only 12 followers

28:18.165 --> 28:23.270
and he was nailed to the cross
and beaten to death
by the age of 33.

28:30.444 --> 28:34.215
On the phone, you told me
you already had this part.

28:35.382 --> 28:40.120
Now, that... was a lie.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.227
Uh, yes. Yes, it was.

28:52.366 --> 28:54.368
It's okay, darling.

28:56.904 --> 28:58.973
The lies
are the work of the demons

28:59.006 --> 29:02.076
and they convince us
that we should
disguise our insecurities.

29:02.109 --> 29:05.379
But in reality,
they are leading us

29:05.412 --> 29:08.315
further and further
from who we truly are.

29:11.285 --> 29:13.521
Now, I don't need to
tell you this

29:13.555 --> 29:16.757
because I know that
you can feel it in yourself.

29:19.126 --> 29:21.462
Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.

29:25.132 --> 29:28.802
I have a call back on Monday
and I need to be--

29:28.836 --> 29:31.171
I need to be great or else
they're gonna give the role

29:31.205 --> 29:33.107
to this dipshit
social climber, Donald.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.299
This Donald...

30:00.635 --> 30:02.369
you're jealous of him.

30:06.206 --> 30:07.575
Mmm.

30:07.609 --> 30:10.077
Ah... jealous? Ah...

30:12.012 --> 30:14.516
Okay, we share
the same acting class.

30:14.549 --> 30:18.852
And he's just one of those dudes
that was blessed with good luck,
you know?

30:18.886 --> 30:22.022
He did this commercial
when he was two years old,
this antiabortion PSA.

30:22.056 --> 30:27.061
And-and it aired on TV
every Christmas for eight years.

30:33.568 --> 30:35.402
Everyone has their own path.

30:36.970 --> 30:39.607
Donald is on his,

30:39.641 --> 30:42.409
and you will find yours.

30:44.411 --> 30:45.446
I hope so.

30:48.115 --> 30:51.118
Are you believing anything
that I'm telling you, Clayton?

30:51.151 --> 30:53.487
Or do you secretly think
I've lost my mind?

30:53.521 --> 30:56.390
What? No. Yeah, I-I--
listen, I totally believe you.

30:56.423 --> 30:59.460
It's just all of this
is so new to me. Okay?

30:59.493 --> 31:03.330
So, it's just--
it just feels foreign
and it's hard to take it all in.

31:05.600 --> 31:10.572
Very difficult for us
to challenge the things
we think we know.

31:10.605 --> 31:14.375
Very difficult for us
to know anything these days
when everything;

31:14.408 --> 31:16.644
the media, science, social code,

31:16.678 --> 31:19.413
everything is brought with

31:19.446 --> 31:24.084
so much contradiction
and insecurity.

31:24.118 --> 31:27.655
I mean, there's a reason
why I live out here, darling.

31:27.689 --> 31:32.426
I rarely use the internet.
I very rarely use the phone.

31:32.459 --> 31:38.165
All of that... causes a great
deal of psychic trauma.

31:38.198 --> 31:41.468
And that is how
the evil spirits take hold.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.609
I would like to help you,
Clayton...

31:50.010 --> 31:56.684
both spiritually,
and with your career ambitions.

31:56.718 --> 31:59.721
But you are going to
have to come a very long way

31:59.754 --> 32:03.023
from where you are
right now.

32:07.461 --> 32:08.962
Yeah, I can do that.

32:09.997 --> 32:11.599
Yeah, I will do that.

32:31.351 --> 32:34.087
You know how much
I love you guys, right?

32:34.121 --> 32:37.057
No. You love me? I thought you
fucking hated me, babe.

32:40.160 --> 32:41.995
So much, I want to set
your face on fire.

32:45.767 --> 32:50.170
One year ago today, my mom died
at 7:32 and my dad died at 7:48.

32:57.444 --> 32:59.647
Can I ask you a question, Nik?

33:06.654 --> 33:08.088
How did they die?

33:08.121 --> 33:09.423
Donald, dude.

33:09.456 --> 33:11.458
I don't want to talk about it,
really.

33:11.492 --> 33:13.393
Sorry,
I shouldn't have brought it up.

33:13.427 --> 33:15.630
Oh, okay. Okay.

33:15.663 --> 33:18.666
Wow! I just-- I kind of feel
like a fucking dick right now.

33:18.700 --> 33:25.038
I mean, you did say your
parents' respective death's,
like, to the minute.

33:25.072 --> 33:28.643
So, I thought it was
kind of fair game, but, okay.
You know what?

33:28.676 --> 33:31.779
You know what we need right now?
A little adrenaline!

33:31.813 --> 33:35.415
It's getting little too modelin'
in this bitch.

33:35.449 --> 33:38.285
That means sad, Petra.

33:38.318 --> 33:42.524
I'm sorry that me
grieving my dead parents
is so boring to you.

33:42.557 --> 33:46.326
No, I-I understand
it's a sensitive issue.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.329
But you just can't get
in your head right now. Okay?

33:49.363 --> 33:51.164
It's gonna blow your high.

33:54.502 --> 33:55.503
Wait...

33:57.271 --> 33:58.438
Oh...

34:00.140 --> 34:01.341
Interesting.

34:02.844 --> 34:06.046
Do you girls
believe in paranormal activity?

34:06.848 --> 34:10.518
Spirits? The resurrection?

34:10.552 --> 34:12.419
No, I don't.

34:12.452 --> 34:15.389
Well, I do because I'm gonna
be playing one.

34:15.422 --> 34:16.824
A retarded ghost?

34:16.858 --> 34:20.327
Shut the fuck up!
A demonologist.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.330
I got a callback for this movie
<i>Psychic Highway</i> on Monday.

34:23.363 --> 34:25.465
I mean, the role is, like,
pretty much mine.

34:25.499 --> 34:26.834
It's just a formality
at this point.

34:26.868 --> 34:29.102
I got a couple of, like,
cocksuckers in my bullpen

34:29.136 --> 34:30.004
that I gotta clear out.

34:30.038 --> 34:32.840
But pretty much,
I am in preparation mode.

34:32.874 --> 34:38.211
How might you ask, is Donald
gonna prepare for this part?

34:38.245 --> 34:42.215
Well, I'll fucking tell you:
an emotional purge.

34:42.249 --> 34:46.888
Think of me as a demon therapist
and you're my patient.

34:46.921 --> 34:48.556
Who is your patient?

34:54.662 --> 34:56.263
Come on, Nik.

34:56.296 --> 34:58.332
It'll help loosen you up.

34:58.365 --> 35:00.602
She's pretty loose as it is.

35:00.635 --> 35:02.704
She's right. I'm a huge slut.

35:02.737 --> 35:04.171
No, I know.

35:04.204 --> 35:08.342
But I mean, listen,
you hold everything inside.

35:08.375 --> 35:11.278
That's why you're so
stressed out all the time.

35:11.311 --> 35:13.881
I need to prepare
for this role.

35:13.915 --> 35:17.484
You need to emotionally purge.

35:17.518 --> 35:20.320
I mean, we're just gonna
kill two birds with one stone.

35:21.789 --> 35:24.358
And, artist to friend...

35:26.426 --> 35:30.832
you're in a safe place...
with me.

35:33.801 --> 35:35.135
How safe?

35:49.751 --> 35:53.186
<i>Guys, we are</i>
<i>about to embark on</i>
<i>a spiritual experience</i>

35:53.220 --> 35:55.790
<i>with the beautiful</i>
<i>Ms. Nikki over here.</i>

35:55.823 --> 35:57.491
- <i>Stop. I'm fine.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

35:57.525 --> 35:58.960
<i>I'm just regular pretty.</i>

35:58.993 --> 36:01.228
<i>That's right.
</i> <i>And she's agreed</i> <i>to be the guinea pig</i>

36:01.261 --> 36:03.931
<i>in a little research</i>
<i>experiment of mine.</i>

36:03.965 --> 36:05.298
<i>What kind of research, you ask?</i>

36:05.332 --> 36:07.467
<i>Well, when you see me</i>

36:07.502 --> 36:11.438
<i>on the cover of</i> Deadline,
<i>you'll find out.</i>

36:11.471 --> 36:15.510
<i>And then the only research</i>
<i>you'll be doing is Googling</i>

36:15.543 --> 36:19.346
<i>how to suck Don Don's</i>
<i>big old nutsack.</i>

36:19.379 --> 36:21.381
<i>Don't be gross.</i>
<i>Don't be gross in the video.</i>

36:27.522 --> 36:29.423
Do you have everything you need,
Clayton?

36:29.456 --> 36:31.893
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:31.926 --> 36:33.695
What's that?

36:35.029 --> 36:36.396
A phone.

36:36.864 --> 36:38.533
Mmm.

36:38.566 --> 36:41.435
A device is more treacherous
than a breast ripper.

36:43.738 --> 36:45.472
It's a distraction.

36:45.506 --> 36:47.775
It feels nothing
but jealousy and despair.

36:49.711 --> 36:51.378
Okay,
I-I can turn it off if you...

36:53.815 --> 36:55.717
If only it were that simple.

37:00.521 --> 37:02.289
Re-- Really?

37:06.694 --> 37:07.862
Okay.

37:14.702 --> 37:17.739
Ha! Feel better already.

37:18.673 --> 37:19.574
Yep.

37:20.541 --> 37:21.542
Good night.

38:17.098 --> 38:20.067
You're in my driveway.
Get out of my fuckin' driveway!

38:24.872 --> 38:26.607
You want some?

38:26.641 --> 38:27.975
You want some?

39:44.518 --> 39:46.153
<i>Hi, I'm Eliza.</i>

39:46.187 --> 39:49.590
<i>Hi. I'm your host,</i>
<i>Eliza Atwood.</i>

39:49.624 --> 39:54.028
<i>Welcome to an episode</i>
<i>of the</i> Lost Dimension.

39:54.061 --> 39:57.698
<i>Now tell me, brave viewers.</i>
<i>What scares you the most?</i>

39:57.732 --> 40:00.801
<i>Ghosts, demons, UFOs?</i>

40:00.835 --> 40:01.836
<i>Hi.</i>

40:01.869 --> 40:05.640
<i>Or do you simply give yourself</i>
<i>the heebie-jeebies?</i>

40:05.673 --> 40:07.575
<i>Are you an emotion masochist?</i>

40:07.608 --> 40:09.977
<i>Do you sabotage</i>
<i>your own opportunities?</i>

40:10.011 --> 40:11.746
<i>Do you fear for the future?</i>

40:11.779 --> 40:14.982
<i>Well, on tonight's episode,</i>

40:15.016 --> 40:18.485
<i>we're gonna follow</i>
<i>an innocent man</i>
<i>who lives in upstate New York.</i>

40:18.519 --> 40:24.491
<i>But one night,</i>
<i>a visitor comes knocking.</i>
<i>Whether it'd be in human form?</i>

40:24.525 --> 40:28.029
<i>Well, you're gonna have to</i>
<i>hold your breath to find out.</i>

41:45.740 --> 41:49.877
David Mamet says actors should
just say their lines.

41:49.910 --> 41:53.180
Forget about their motivation
and their subtext.

41:53.214 --> 41:56.851
Just say their lines
plainly and simply.

41:57.818 --> 41:59.220
I agree.

41:59.253 --> 42:03.290
I hate all that pretentious
preparation horse shit.

42:03.324 --> 42:06.927
No, you've got to
go with instinct.

42:06.961 --> 42:08.562
Be in the moment, you know?

42:08.596 --> 42:09.897
You feel something,

42:09.930 --> 42:12.233
find an energy,
key into that energy,

42:12.266 --> 42:14.235
and then just let it rip.

42:14.268 --> 42:15.636
Who's David Mamet?

42:17.605 --> 42:19.140
Who's David Mamet?

42:21.008 --> 42:23.244
What's your point, Don?

42:23.277 --> 42:26.180
I'm going to ask you
a series of questions.

42:26.213 --> 42:28.149
I don't want you
to over think the answers.

42:28.182 --> 42:30.885
I just want you to say the first
thing that comes to your head.

42:30.918 --> 42:33.988
Remember,
over thinking is the enemy.
Okay? Remember that.

42:34.021 --> 42:35.656
What kinds of questions
you gonna ask me?

42:35.689 --> 42:38.592
Okay. So, you just did it right
there. That was a question.

42:38.626 --> 42:40.094
Only answers.

42:40.127 --> 42:42.229
Okay, well, what does this
have to do with playing a demon?

42:42.263 --> 42:46.801
Demonologist. Also, Petra,
that's a fucking question. Okay?

42:46.834 --> 42:48.803
What do you
want me to do, Don?

42:48.836 --> 42:52.606
Okay, just close your eyes.
Deep breath.

42:54.375 --> 42:56.043
You guys should take some shots

42:56.077 --> 42:57.912
'cause you're being
a fucking asshole right now.

42:57.945 --> 42:59.914
And I just feel like
it'll be more fun for me.

42:59.947 --> 43:02.149
That's actually--
that's actually
a really good idea.

43:02.183 --> 43:03.150
- Thank God. Yes.
- Okay.

43:03.184 --> 43:04.618
- Oh, my gosh.
- You first.

43:04.652 --> 43:05.953
Here you go.

43:15.796 --> 43:16.630
Whoo.

43:16.664 --> 43:19.633
I say that after
every question answered,

43:19.667 --> 43:20.601
we both take a shot.

43:20.634 --> 43:23.204
Okay. But you realize
that I'm old, right?

43:23.237 --> 43:25.406
You're gonna give me
fucking alcohol poisoning.

43:25.439 --> 43:28.275
Maybe. Just keep the questions
to a minimum,

43:28.309 --> 43:31.712
and then Petra won't have to
pump our stomachs.

43:31.745 --> 43:33.614
All right.

43:35.049 --> 43:38.119
- Okay. First official question.
- Mmm.

43:40.287 --> 43:42.423
Why am I such a great actor?

43:42.456 --> 43:47.194
- Because you were born with it.
- God. Very good. Wow.

43:48.295 --> 43:51.265
Yeah. Mmm.

43:55.069 --> 43:57.438
You guys
are gonna get fucked up.

43:57.471 --> 43:59.373
Yeah. She's right.

44:01.308 --> 44:03.811
Do you believe in
demonic possession?

44:08.449 --> 44:09.817
Answer.

44:09.850 --> 44:11.085
No, I don't.

44:16.991 --> 44:19.393
Do you feel guilty
about your dog, Riley?

44:20.761 --> 44:21.862
What?

44:21.896 --> 44:25.733
His intestines exploded
out of his ass under the wheels.

44:25.766 --> 44:28.369
- Donald, what the fuck, man.
- Petra, please.

44:28.402 --> 44:31.705
No. I don't feel guilty
about it, asshole.

44:32.907 --> 44:35.276
I let him out by accident.

44:35.309 --> 44:38.445
I was literally ten years old,
and he was a shit dog.

44:38.479 --> 44:41.882
Mmm. Wow.

44:41.916 --> 44:44.151
Can you continue with this
Spanish Inquisition, please?

44:44.185 --> 44:45.953
- You know, maybe we should--
- Petra, please!

44:45.986 --> 44:47.454
No, seriously,
this is fucking stupid.

44:47.488 --> 44:50.191
This is not fucking stupid,
Petra! Okay?

44:50.224 --> 44:54.862
It's not fucking stupid!
I'm getting into character.
She needs this. I need this.

44:54.895 --> 44:56.797
The only person
that doesn't need to...

44:56.830 --> 44:58.866
- Fuck you, Donny!
- ...fucking be here
right now is you!

44:58.899 --> 45:02.369
You are providing no fucking
service of any kind. Okay?

45:02.403 --> 45:05.239
Just shut the fuck up!

45:05.272 --> 45:07.274
Sorry about that. Okay.

45:09.043 --> 45:10.377
Did your parents
love each other?

45:13.180 --> 45:15.816
Yes. Next question.

45:17.885 --> 45:19.386
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

45:19.420 --> 45:21.388
Yeah.
Next question, please.

45:23.991 --> 45:26.260
Now...

45:26.293 --> 45:30.064
What really happened
to your parents, Nik?

45:30.097 --> 45:32.866
You gotta be honest with me.
I mean, it's gonna
make you feel better.

45:32.900 --> 45:35.035
- Why are you asking me this?
- A lot better. Because it's...

45:35.069 --> 45:37.505
- Why the fuck
are you asking me this?
- ...my craft.

45:37.539 --> 45:39.940
Your dad shot your mom.

45:39.974 --> 45:41.141
- What are you doing?
- Your dad--

45:41.175 --> 45:43.911
- You don't know anything.
- No, your dad shot your mom,

45:43.944 --> 45:46.213
- and then he hung himself.
- Knock it off, dude!

45:46.247 --> 45:47.815
You know what--
Was he possessed?

45:47.848 --> 45:50.451
Did a supernatural force
make him do it?

45:50.484 --> 45:53.954
I mean, you said yourself
they're happily married
for 25 years.

45:53.988 --> 45:56.257
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- Happy marriage for 25 years.

45:56.290 --> 45:58.560
And all of a sudden,
he just fucking shoots your mom?

45:58.593 --> 46:00.894
- Why are you asking me this?
- Why the hell would he do that?

46:00.928 --> 46:02.162
- Why would your dad--
- Shut up! Shut up!

46:02.196 --> 46:03.464
Why would your dad--
shot your mom!

46:03.497 --> 46:05.432
I told you that in confidence,
you asshole!

46:05.466 --> 46:08.002
Why would your father
shoot your mother?

46:08.035 --> 46:10.271
- Why do you give a shit?
- And then fucking hang himself?

46:10.304 --> 46:11.872
No, stop!
I'm asking you to stop!

46:11.905 --> 46:13.073
I'm literally
asking you to stop!

46:13.107 --> 46:14.341
- He shot your mom!
- Stop it!

46:14.375 --> 46:16.343
- Why would he possibly do it?
- I don't know!

46:16.377 --> 46:20.047
There's no possible reason why
a man would do that to his wife!

46:20.080 --> 46:21.882
This is my house!
Get the fuck out of my house!

46:21.915 --> 46:25.019
- Get out of my house!
- It doesn't make
any sense here. Why?

46:25.052 --> 46:27.321
Why would your father
shoot your mother...

46:27.354 --> 46:29.189
- Why do you give a shit?
- ...and then
fucking hang himself?

46:29.223 --> 46:30.424
Why do you fucking care?

46:30.457 --> 46:32.860
It has nothing to fucking do
with you, you piece of shit!

46:32.893 --> 46:34.928
He loved her!
Nikki, why would he do it?

46:34.962 --> 46:36.363
Fuck you! Stop it!

46:36.397 --> 46:37.865
Your dad shot your mom

46:37.898 --> 46:39.066
- and then he hung himself!
- Stop it! Stop it!

46:39.099 --> 46:41.135
Nikki, we're not done yet!
Nikki!

46:41.168 --> 46:42.604
Nikki, we're not done yet.

46:42.637 --> 46:45.072
- Nikki! Nikki!
- Fuck you, asshole!

46:45.105 --> 46:46.473
- Please!
Are you fucking insane?
- You wanna get fucked?!

46:50.144 --> 46:52.146
Shut your fucking mouth,
you fucking cunt!

46:52.179 --> 46:53.947
Shut the fuck up!

46:53.981 --> 46:55.949
You want to it pry into my soul
for your dumb fucking movie

46:55.983 --> 46:57.251
that no one's
ever gonna fucking see

46:57.284 --> 46:58.118
because it's a dumb fucking
movie,

46:58.152 --> 46:59.521
and you think
it's so fucking good?

46:59.554 --> 47:00.888
You're not even gonna
book the part,

47:00.921 --> 47:02.189
you fucking asshole!

47:02.222 --> 47:03.424
You want to interrogate me,

47:03.457 --> 47:06.427
my father murdered my mother
because she fucking cheated him.

47:06.460 --> 47:09.096
And then he killed himself...

47:09.129 --> 47:12.333
- You're fucking right!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, Nikki.

47:12.366 --> 47:15.302
I'm just acting.
I'm just acting!

47:15.336 --> 47:17.605
- I'm an actor, too!
- I'm an actor, please!

47:17.639 --> 47:21.208
I'm an actor, too.

47:21.241 --> 47:24.078
I'm an actor-- I'm acting.

47:24.111 --> 47:26.648
I'm acting.

47:29.551 --> 47:31.385
So funny!

47:34.221 --> 47:37.057
I like that.

47:37.659 --> 47:39.059
Oh, my God!

47:41.962 --> 47:45.366
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

47:55.543 --> 47:57.378
I am going to give...

47:58.513 --> 48:02.449
such a nuanced performance.

48:17.364 --> 48:18.432
What?

48:20.434 --> 48:21.368
What?

48:22.169 --> 48:23.237
What?

48:24.606 --> 48:27.509
Well, I was just, um...

48:27.542 --> 48:30.444
I was just wondering
when we were gonna
talk about your TV career.

48:43.357 --> 48:46.160
In the year 2000,

48:46.193 --> 48:49.396
I hosted one of
the first female-led

48:49.430 --> 48:52.734
ghost hunting reality TV shows
on network television.

48:54.368 --> 48:58.540
It lasted half a season.
Got a bunch of negative reviews.

48:58.573 --> 49:00.608
And that was that.

49:00.642 --> 49:04.278
Wait, so... so you're an actor.

49:06.614 --> 49:07.615
Why did you give it up?

49:08.616 --> 49:10.484
I found my true calling.

49:10.518 --> 49:13.053
Hmm.

49:13.086 --> 49:14.722
Do you ever have, like,
an itch to get back to it?

49:14.756 --> 49:15.924
No!

49:18.526 --> 49:19.694
Okay.

49:29.637 --> 49:32.740
<i>The Mallam Extractum.</i>

49:32.774 --> 49:37.311
This is the preeminent text
for summoning and extracting
spirits.

49:39.480 --> 49:42.216
And this is
an original manuscript.

49:42.249 --> 49:43.150
Great.

49:46.086 --> 49:49.289
I use it as a guiding force
for my practices.

49:51.659 --> 49:54.194
And the work begins now.

50:11.679 --> 50:13.480
So, is this like--
is it training then?

50:17.217 --> 50:19.186
Oh, this is
more than training, Clayton.

50:20.487 --> 50:22.690
This is evolution.
Here we go!

50:26.093 --> 50:28.161
You are a worthy being.

50:28.195 --> 50:30.430
I am a worthy being!

50:30.464 --> 50:32.165
You are your own being.

50:32.199 --> 50:34.201
I am my own being!

50:34.234 --> 50:37.404
You are free of thought
and free of mind.

50:37.437 --> 50:40.307
I am free of thought
and free of mind!

50:40.340 --> 50:41.776
You are your best self!

50:44.846 --> 50:47.347
I am my best self.

50:47.381 --> 50:50.150
I am my best self!
I am my best self!

50:50.183 --> 50:52.554
- Say it!
- I am my best self!

50:52.587 --> 50:56.223
- Louder!
- I am my best self!

51:07.869 --> 51:12.072
All right.
Close your eyes.

51:21.248 --> 51:23.483
I want you
to think about your life.

51:25.252 --> 51:27.454
Think about your family,

51:27.487 --> 51:29.389
think about your friends...

51:30.490 --> 51:33.528
boyfriends, girlfriends.

51:39.299 --> 51:41.636
Now, tell me about
the worst day of your life.

51:44.371 --> 51:45.640
There are plenty.

51:48.175 --> 51:49.409
Pick one.

51:54.782 --> 51:57.117
I called my mom a bitch once.

52:01.556 --> 52:03.190
Where's your mother now?

52:06.961 --> 52:09.329
She left me.

52:16.971 --> 52:18.438
And your father?

52:22.242 --> 52:25.445
Off in Miami messing around
with his boy toy, Max.

52:25.947 --> 52:27.481
I see.

52:29.617 --> 52:31.184
Are they happy?

52:37.558 --> 52:38.559
Yeah.

52:44.464 --> 52:45.600
Clayton...

52:46.634 --> 52:49.236
Yes.

52:49.269 --> 52:51.706
Are you telling me
the truth about your mother?

53:41.622 --> 53:42.924
I killed her.

53:47.028 --> 53:51.231
I crashed my car,
and I killed her.

53:58.506 --> 54:00.675
She was my best friend.

54:06.547 --> 54:07.715
It's okay.

54:24.899 --> 54:25.933
It's okay.

55:15.950 --> 55:17.718
It is now time...

55:19.120 --> 55:21.556
to perform the ritual.

55:21.589 --> 55:22.590
Okay.

55:23.423 --> 55:24.659
One last thing...

55:26.761 --> 55:33.701
blood magic is essential
in luring a demon.

55:35.736 --> 55:38.005
Yeah,
how much blood do we need?

55:38.039 --> 55:39.874
Oh, not your blood,
sweetie.

56:13.674 --> 56:14.942
Come here.

56:20.014 --> 56:23.618
Think of your mother,
think of Donald.

56:24.619 --> 56:26.721
Think of all your past failures.

56:29.190 --> 56:30.725
Let them go.

56:54.215 --> 56:55.950
At this point,

56:55.983 --> 57:01.689
it is imperative
that your eyes remain closed.

57:01.722 --> 57:05.059
But if my eyes are closed,
how am I gonna see the spirits?

57:05.092 --> 57:07.128
Well, let's just say
you're gonna feel them.

57:09.096 --> 57:09.997
Okay.

57:10.998 --> 57:12.967
All right. Great.

57:14.135 --> 57:17.738
So, once we begin the ritual,

57:17.772 --> 57:22.576
it's very important that neither
of us leave the house.

57:22.610 --> 57:24.979
Because, you see...

57:25.012 --> 57:30.251
if the spirits escape whilst
we're in the process of
summoning them,

57:30.284 --> 57:33.521
we have no idea
what havoc they will create.

57:36.557 --> 57:38.926
Clayton Walker...

57:38.960 --> 57:43.698
your mind has been possessed
by evil spirits.

57:43.731 --> 57:45.800
As I stand here before you,

57:45.833 --> 57:51.105
I address the spirits
that have corrupted
your every thought and desire.

57:51.138 --> 57:55.042
Clayton Walker, do you hear me?

57:56.277 --> 57:58.012
Yes.

57:58.045 --> 58:03.551
Spirits inside
of Clayton Walker,
do you hear me?

58:21.836 --> 58:23.137
Whoa! Whoa!
What the fuck!

58:23.170 --> 58:24.839
What are you doing?
You've ruined it!

58:24.872 --> 58:26.307
Ruined what? You just started
to fucking stab me.

58:26.340 --> 58:29.710
Oh, stop being neurotic.
I'm performing
an ancient ritual.

58:29.744 --> 58:31.078
Fuck this and fuck the ritual!

58:31.112 --> 58:32.780
Oh, Clayton.

58:32.813 --> 58:35.316
Honey, slow down. Clayton.

58:37.184 --> 58:39.754
Trusting that fucking psycho!

58:39.787 --> 58:40.755
God--

58:51.065 --> 58:53.701
So, that's it?
You're giving up?

58:57.004 --> 59:00.341
Well, I guess
that's why you don't get
any of the roles you want.

59:00.374 --> 59:03.878
Are you out of your mind?
You just tried to stab me.

59:03.911 --> 59:06.113
Oh, come on.
It's an ancient ritual.

59:06.147 --> 59:11.218
That was just an act of
intimidation designed to
lure out the evil spirits.

59:11.252 --> 59:13.354
It's just part of the process.

59:13.387 --> 59:16.857
Yeah, well, I didn't see or feel
any evil spirits, did you?

59:16.891 --> 59:19.960
Well, you did open your eyes
and run off, silly.

59:19.994 --> 59:24.598
Yeah, I tend to do that
when I see someone
raise a knife on me, Eliza!

59:24.632 --> 59:28.235
- What? You think I'm going to--
- What?! What do you want?

59:28.269 --> 59:30.938
You think I'm going to flip
a switch and extract a demon?

59:32.139 --> 59:34.108
Well, you're going to flip
a switch and become a star.

59:34.141 --> 59:35.076
I mean, let's get real.

59:35.109 --> 59:37.178
After all of your years
as a failed actor,

59:37.211 --> 59:42.650
I would expect you
to understand that
anything that's worth having

59:42.683 --> 59:46.187
takes patience, darling,
takes tenacity.

59:46.220 --> 59:48.055
Oh, tenacity? Okay.

59:48.089 --> 59:50.224
Well, I don't think I'm prepared
to wait out my whole life

59:50.257 --> 59:53.060
for some evil spirits that may
or may not blow on my neck,

59:53.094 --> 59:55.329
or do whatever
the fuck they do, Eliza.

1:00:17.051 --> 1:00:21.989
<i>♪ And I have loved you</i>
<i>for so long ♪</i>

1:00:23.157 --> 1:00:27.728
<i>♪ Delighting in your company ♪</i>

1:00:32.700 --> 1:00:34.101
You were doing so well.

1:00:37.938 --> 1:00:40.007
Why were you singing that song?

1:00:43.878 --> 1:00:46.247
I know deep down you believe,
Clayton.

1:00:47.848 --> 1:00:49.817
I can feel it in your soul.

1:00:56.757 --> 1:00:58.325
Why don't I make us some tea?

1:01:00.194 --> 1:01:02.263
You could take a bath,

1:01:02.296 --> 1:01:04.765
take a little time to yourself.

1:01:08.035 --> 1:01:09.937
Please, don't leave.

1:01:27.488 --> 1:01:32.293
<i>♪ Greensleeves are my delight ♪</i>

1:01:32.326 --> 1:01:36.864
<i>♪ Greensleeves are my delight ♪</i>

1:02:19.873 --> 1:02:21.208
Tea is ready.

1:02:25.012 --> 1:02:26.113
Okay.

1:02:34.288 --> 1:02:35.389
Ahh.

1:02:42.029 --> 1:02:44.298
You have a nice cock, darling.

1:02:46.467 --> 1:02:50.904
Not too big, not too small.
Just perfect.

1:03:00.481 --> 1:03:05.085
I don't see you returning
to your old life after all this.

1:03:05.119 --> 1:03:08.889
I mean, let's face it,
it was pretty empty...

1:03:09.990 --> 1:03:11.825
emotionally.

1:03:14.428 --> 1:03:15.329
Boring.

1:03:24.905 --> 1:03:27.107
What excites you, Clayton?

1:03:31.178 --> 1:03:32.346
I don't know.

1:03:35.983 --> 1:03:38.085
You know what excites me?

1:03:44.124 --> 1:03:45.326
Death.

1:03:51.498 --> 1:03:53.200
Okay.

1:03:53.233 --> 1:03:55.369
- Then why haven't--
- Why haven't I killed myself?

1:03:57.237 --> 1:03:58.138
Yeah.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:05.212
I've been planning my exit into
hell for a very long time.

1:04:05.245 --> 1:04:08.516
Last thing I want to do
is waste it on a simple suicide.

1:04:24.431 --> 1:04:25.866
Your turn.

1:04:30.471 --> 1:04:32.306
I wanna be a movie star.

1:04:38.713 --> 1:04:41.281
Why do you want to be
a movie star, Clayton?

1:04:41.315 --> 1:04:44.918
Because it's... it's validation,

1:04:44.952 --> 1:04:46.521
proof I was right.

1:04:46.554 --> 1:04:48.222
Can't you prove that
to yourself?

1:04:48.255 --> 1:04:50.224
I mean, why do you need some
producer to prove that for you?

1:04:50.257 --> 1:04:52.527
- No, it's not the same.
- Why?

1:04:54.027 --> 1:04:55.095
Just because.

1:04:55.996 --> 1:04:57.264
That's not an answer.

1:04:57.297 --> 1:05:00.200
Because it's-it's obvious,
Eliza.

1:05:00.234 --> 1:05:01.268
Is it?

1:05:01.301 --> 1:05:03.937
You land a big role
and then...

1:05:03.971 --> 1:05:06.508
and then you deliver
in that role and you prove
that you can do it.

1:05:08.710 --> 1:05:11.679
I just--
I don't see the joy in that.

1:05:11.713 --> 1:05:13.981
I mean, if I want to
prove something to myself,

1:05:14.014 --> 1:05:15.550
I just...
prove it to myself.

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:17.719
Okay, well, then it's not--
It's not just for myself.

1:05:17.752 --> 1:05:22.156
- Well, then,
who is it for, Clayton?
- It's for everyone. Okay?

1:05:22.189 --> 1:05:24.458
Everyone will know
they were wrong about me.

1:05:24.491 --> 1:05:26.493
Everyone who thought--
who thought I was a fool

1:05:26.528 --> 1:05:29.196
for pursuing this life,
every other actor who--

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:30.497
who thought
they were better than me.

1:05:30.532 --> 1:05:31.465
I want to see them standing...

1:05:31.498 --> 1:05:33.467
...on their miserable feet,

1:05:33.501 --> 1:05:35.703
clapping for me. Clayton!

1:05:35.737 --> 1:05:37.070
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:05:37.104 --> 1:05:39.006
Like this. Okay.

1:05:39.039 --> 1:05:41.475
I could do that for you
right now, Clayton.

1:05:41.509 --> 1:05:43.143
That's it.

1:05:43.177 --> 1:05:44.244
Why don't you take a bow?

1:05:44.278 --> 1:05:46.380
Take a bow, Clayton.
Take a bow.

1:05:46.413 --> 1:05:49.082
Come on, sweetie.
Take a bow.

1:05:49.116 --> 1:05:51.351
Where are you gonna be, sweetie?
Maybe up in the sky

1:05:51.385 --> 1:05:53.153
- looking down at them?
- It doesn't fucking matter.

1:05:53.187 --> 1:05:54.321
It does not matter to me.

1:05:54.354 --> 1:05:56.990
Just knowing
that it's happening,
that's all that I need.

1:05:57.024 --> 1:05:58.992
Okay. But who cares?
I mean, really.

1:05:59.026 --> 1:06:02.463
I mean,
you don't care about them.
They don't care about you.

1:06:02.496 --> 1:06:04.465
You just told me
how miserable they all are.

1:06:04.498 --> 1:06:08.235
I mean who cares?
Who cares?!

1:06:12.206 --> 1:06:13.340
I do.

1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:22.349
It makes you want to
punch Donald in the face

1:06:22.382 --> 1:06:24.485
every time you see him,
don't you, darling?

1:06:26.386 --> 1:06:28.188
Go on.

1:06:28.222 --> 1:06:31.593
You tell me
what you want to do to him.

1:06:31.626 --> 1:06:36.196
I want to cut his head off
with a buzz saw
and put it in the dumpster.

1:06:46.741 --> 1:06:49.376
You see,
if you let go of all that,

1:06:49.409 --> 1:06:50.645
Donald doesn't matter...

1:06:52.246 --> 1:06:54.047
none of it matters.

1:06:55.482 --> 1:06:57.451
Only you matter, sweetie.

1:07:00.822 --> 1:07:02.422
Only you.

1:07:07.327 --> 1:07:10.364
I told my mom
I would make it.

1:07:10.397 --> 1:07:12.432
She believed
I would make it.

1:07:13.433 --> 1:07:14.769
I'm gonna make it.

1:07:15.737 --> 1:07:17.337
Yes.

1:07:19.607 --> 1:07:23.511
Oh, yes, darling.
Oh, yes.

1:07:23.545 --> 1:07:26.714
Come here. Come here.

1:07:26.748 --> 1:07:30.852
- Ooh.
- Let it go.

1:07:30.885 --> 1:07:32.286
<i>Clayton, honey.</i>

1:07:32.319 --> 1:07:33.688
What the fuck?!

1:07:38.526 --> 1:07:40.127
I just--

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.764
I just heard my--
I just heard my mom.

1:07:47.502 --> 1:07:48.670
Yeah.

1:07:49.871 --> 1:07:51.338
She's here.

1:07:51.371 --> 1:07:52.707
<i>Clayton, honey.</i>

1:07:52.740 --> 1:07:54.676
What the fuck?

1:08:00.213 --> 1:08:03.350
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:08:13.561 --> 1:08:15.295
Come on!
How do I get out of here?

1:08:15.329 --> 1:08:16.898
You don't.

1:08:16.931 --> 1:08:18.198
Oh, yeah?

1:08:20.802 --> 1:08:23.236
- Fuck!
<i>- Clayton.</i>

1:08:23.270 --> 1:08:24.906
What's so funny?

1:08:24.939 --> 1:08:26.273
You.

1:08:26.306 --> 1:08:28.342
Why won't the window break?

1:08:28.375 --> 1:08:30.812
Maybe you're not supposed to
leave here, Clayton.

1:08:32.179 --> 1:08:33.548
Yeah, you wanna fuck with me?

1:09:16.624 --> 1:09:18.926
Kill me. Come on. Come on.

1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:19.927
Do it.

1:09:22.262 --> 1:09:24.364
Come on. Kill me. Kill me.

1:11:26.921 --> 1:11:29.289
Where is my mom?

1:11:32.425 --> 1:11:33.761
Oh...

1:11:35.963 --> 1:11:37.698
She's right in here.

1:11:41.803 --> 1:11:44.005
Shh...

1:11:48.543 --> 1:11:50.845
What do you want from me?

1:11:52.847 --> 1:11:55.382
You see, I've been
thinking about what you said.

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:05.726
And I did
want more out of life.

1:12:08.029 --> 1:12:12.700
I always... wanted a family.

1:12:15.837 --> 1:12:18.639
I-I actually wanted a son.

1:12:44.699 --> 1:12:46.133
Let's see...

1:12:46.167 --> 1:12:49.537
You do seem a little confused.

1:12:49.570 --> 1:12:52.573
Perhaps this shall
help clear your mind.

1:13:01.448 --> 1:13:02.717
Aah.

1:13:04.051 --> 1:13:05.820
It was a trap.

1:13:07.788 --> 1:13:13.094
My boy... we have a higher
calling to attend to.

1:13:44.058 --> 1:13:45.826
Now, repeat after me.

1:13:55.503 --> 1:13:57.071
Clayton, repeat!

1:14:19.126 --> 1:14:20.828
Now, come to me.

1:14:24.899 --> 1:14:27.868
Come to me, my son.

1:14:57.298 --> 1:15:00.735
You're stupid! You're dumb!
Stupid! Dumb!

1:15:00.768 --> 1:15:03.904
The green tea has
finally paralyzed your body.

1:15:04.972 --> 1:15:07.008
Now, we can be together...

1:15:08.843 --> 1:15:10.011
forever.

1:15:17.318 --> 1:15:21.055
All I've ever wanted
is a child...

1:15:22.990 --> 1:15:29.263
to feed... to bathe...
to love.

1:15:33.768 --> 1:15:38.939
Clayton, I've been
waiting for you my whole life.

1:15:41.876 --> 1:15:45.646
I'd really love it
if you would call me mom.

1:15:48.382 --> 1:15:51.619
Mom.

1:15:51.652 --> 1:15:54.121
Oh, it's so nice.

1:16:00.861 --> 1:16:03.164
Yeah, it tickles me a little.

1:16:03.197 --> 1:16:04.331
Mom.

1:16:16.977 --> 1:16:18.879
Oh, no.

1:16:18.913 --> 1:16:20.581
Mommy's right here.

1:16:21.382 --> 1:16:23.317
Ooh, she's right here.

1:16:36.330 --> 1:16:37.331
Where are you going?

1:20:00.167 --> 1:20:03.337
<i>♪ Sometimes I feel like ♪</i>

1:20:03.370 --> 1:20:04.838
I'm not normal.

1:20:05.973 --> 1:20:08.208
What is normal, anyway?

1:20:08.242 --> 1:20:12.212
Right? I guess...
like everyone else.

1:20:13.515 --> 1:20:17.351
I get stupid thoughts sometimes.

1:20:20.487 --> 1:20:27.027
I keep them to myself
because I don't want anyone
thinking I'm a weirdo.

1:20:27.061 --> 1:20:31.298
I wonder if everyone
get strange thoughts
but just don't want to admit it.

1:20:32.634 --> 1:20:35.235
I think we all get strange
thoughts.

1:20:35.269 --> 1:20:39.106
You wanna know
what kind of thoughts I get?

1:20:40.374 --> 1:20:44.579
Well... I can't tell you

1:20:45.647 --> 1:20:47.314
because it's too embarrassing.

1:20:50.217 --> 1:20:52.554
That was great.
Really, really great.

1:20:52.587 --> 1:20:54.656
- Thank you.
- Really great, Donald.

1:20:54.689 --> 1:20:57.358
Okay. Where do you guys--
where do you guys
shoot this one?

1:20:57.391 --> 1:21:00.194
- We'll give you a call.
- Yeah? Okay, yeah.

1:21:00.227 --> 1:21:03.197
The financing and all that
kinda... stuff.

1:21:03.230 --> 1:21:08.268
Well, just give me a text,
call, email, DM.

1:21:08.302 --> 1:21:09.436
I do it all.

1:21:11.205 --> 1:21:13.407
Thank you. Thank you.
All right, bye, guys.

1:21:20.682 --> 1:21:23.083
Crushed it!

1:21:23.117 --> 1:21:24.385
Christ, he was awful.

1:21:24.418 --> 1:21:27.421
Terrible.
High school acting.

1:21:27.454 --> 1:21:28.989
He gets jobs?

1:21:29.022 --> 1:21:30.357
Commercials mostly.

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:33.327
All right, who's next?

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:37.599
Ah, well, it was supposed to be
Clayton Walker.

1:21:37.632 --> 1:21:41.068
He was supposed to
be here before Donald,
but he didn't show.

1:21:41.101 --> 1:21:42.537
I followed up with his agent,
but--

1:21:42.570 --> 1:21:44.438
- You're kidding.
- I liked that guy.

1:21:44.471 --> 1:21:46.708
- He-he was good.
- He was. Wasn't he?

1:21:46.741 --> 1:21:48.475
He really had something special.
