<i>Â¶ You like potato Â¶</i>

00:29.543 --> 00:31.077
<i>Â¶ And you like po-tah-to Â¶</i>

00:31.145 --> 00:34.848
- Â¶ You like tomato Â¶
- Â¶ And you like to-mah-to Â¶

00:34.915 --> 00:36.716
- Â¶ Potato Â¶
- Â¶ Po-tah-to Â¶

00:36.784 --> 00:38.284
- Â¶ Tomato Â¶
- Â¶ To-mah-to Â¶

00:38.352 --> 00:43.490
Â¶ Let's call the whole
thing <i>off.... icially</i> on! Â¶

00:43.557 --> 00:46.626
Â¶ And toast Valerie and Dave Â¶

00:46.694 --> 00:49.796
Â¶ Togasaki-Rothman! Â¶

00:51.499 --> 00:52.699
You guys will be the hit

00:52.767 --> 00:54.768
of cousin Valerie's wedding reception!

00:54.835 --> 00:57.303
Can I just ask, who
the hell says po-tah-to?

00:57.371 --> 00:58.905
Songwriters who are stuck.

00:58.973 --> 01:00.640
Homie, I'm still a little nervous

01:00.708 --> 01:02.709
about performing in front
of all those people.

01:02.777 --> 01:03.943
Don't worry, sweetie.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.345
With me at your side,

01:05.413 --> 01:07.447
our toast will do just
what it's supposed to:

01:07.515 --> 01:09.449
steal focus from the bride.

01:12.319 --> 01:15.188
Why is everyone staring at static?

01:15.256 --> 01:18.958
We don't have one of those
digital conversion gizmos.

01:19.026 --> 01:21.528
I miss The History Channel, damn it!

01:21.595 --> 01:23.496
How else would I
know what I lived through?

01:23.564 --> 01:26.099
Maybe I should go out and
get you guys a converter.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.034
Aw, that's sweet!

01:28.102 --> 01:30.837
Here's all the money we would've
given to televangelists.

01:30.905 --> 01:33.506
Wow! How long has the tv been out?

01:33.574 --> 01:34.707
'bout ten minutes.

01:39.313 --> 01:41.081
Fore!

01:42.750 --> 01:45.018
Oh, I feel like I'm mashing the tufty

01:45.086 --> 01:46.486
on the links at St. Andrew's!

01:46.554 --> 01:48.688
Sir, your cheeks are ruddy!

01:48.756 --> 01:51.291
Did you eat a sugar cube
when I wasn't watching?

01:51.358 --> 01:52.792
No, it's all thanks

01:52.860 --> 01:55.228
to this self-powered
experience approximater!

01:55.296 --> 01:57.130
I've never seen Mr. Burns this happy.

01:58.899 --> 02:01.568
Just think what that game could
do for grampa and his friends!

02:08.508 --> 02:11.411
Wait, I'm shooting at nazis?

02:11.479 --> 02:13.446
That's not how I remember it.

02:13.514 --> 02:14.848
<i>See you at 5:00</i>

02:14.915 --> 02:16.683
on the dot. Phone kisses!

02:18.586 --> 02:20.286
Â¶ Homer's got a girlfriend! Â¶

02:20.354 --> 02:21.955
She's not my girlfriend.

02:22.022 --> 02:24.657
She's a girl who I married,
who used to be my friend.

02:24.725 --> 02:27.494
Hey, what's your fortune say?

02:27.561 --> 02:30.029
"You will enjoy the company of others."

02:30.097 --> 02:32.432
Wow! That's exactly what
I'm enjoying right now!

02:32.500 --> 02:34.234
- Spooky.
- Mine says,

02:34.301 --> 02:36.736
"Something you lost will soon turn up."

02:36.804 --> 02:38.671
My faith in the Lord.

02:38.739 --> 02:40.173
It came back!

02:40.241 --> 02:42.809
"Today is your lucky day."

02:42.877 --> 02:44.043
Yeah, pfft!

02:44.111 --> 02:45.311
Hey, Homer, if I was you,

02:45.379 --> 02:46.613
I wouldn't be so quick to say "pfft."

02:46.680 --> 02:48.848
Yeah, these cookies are
on the up-and-up now,

02:48.916 --> 02:50.850
according to the only honest newspaper:

02:50.918 --> 02:53.219
<i>The Beijing Daily Worker. See?</i>

02:53.287 --> 02:54.654
If it's your lucky day,

02:54.722 --> 02:56.689
you'd be a fool not
to take advantage of it.

02:56.757 --> 02:58.658
Hey, any part of a cookie you can't eat

02:58.726 --> 03:00.059
is just a waste of time.

03:03.664 --> 03:05.765
What incredible good luck!

03:05.833 --> 03:08.601
Just as the cookie foretold.

03:14.575 --> 03:17.043
Hmm! Maybe this is my lucky day.

03:17.111 --> 03:18.945
A disc?!

03:19.013 --> 03:20.880
Please be compact. Please be compact!

03:20.948 --> 03:22.081
Whoo-hoo!

03:22.149 --> 03:24.450
Here we go.

03:24.518 --> 03:28.588
Â¶ Ooh, what a lucky man Â¶

03:28.656 --> 03:31.357
- Â¶ He was Â¶ 
- Â¶ I is! Â¶

03:34.628 --> 03:37.397
Â¶ Boo-weee-boo-weee-wee,
doo-doo-dee-dee-doo-doo. Â¶

03:37.464 --> 03:42.068
Â¶ Boo-weee-boo-weee-wee,
doo-doo-dee-dee-doo-doo. Â¶

03:42.136 --> 03:45.705
Â¶ Boo-weee-boo-weee-wee,
doo-doo-dee-dee-doo-doo... Â¶

03:45.773 --> 03:46.773
Huh?!

03:46.840 --> 03:49.008
Holy moly!

03:49.076 --> 03:50.977
If it's your lucky day,

03:51.045 --> 03:53.246
you'd be a fool not
to take advantage of it.

03:53.314 --> 03:54.747
There's no time!

03:54.815 --> 03:56.616
I need you for the wedding toast!

03:58.719 --> 04:00.653
My hair!

04:02.189 --> 04:03.456
Now let's get that ticket.

04:05.159 --> 04:08.361
Come on, line, move!

04:08.429 --> 04:10.196
Maybe it'll speed up if I make

04:10.264 --> 04:12.065
"Oh, can you believe this" noises.

04:12.132 --> 04:13.633
Oh. Oh.

04:13.701 --> 04:16.736
Oh, for goodness sakes!

04:16.803 --> 04:18.404
Oh!

04:18.471 --> 04:20.305
Oh! God!

04:21.841 --> 04:24.043
Mm-hmm. Thank you. Come again.

04:24.111 --> 04:25.378
Who is next?

04:25.446 --> 04:27.046
Oh. Hello.

04:27.114 --> 04:27.981
Hmm...

04:29.016 --> 04:30.617
<i>Yo no creÃ­a en fortunas,</i>

04:30.684 --> 04:32.952
<i>pero entonces me saliÃ³ una galleta...</i>

04:33.020 --> 04:34.354
<i>SÃ­, sÃ­.</i>

04:34.421 --> 04:36.289
<i>...que decÃ­a que hoy era
mi dÃ­a dichoso.</i>

04:36.357 --> 04:37.890
<i>Primero no lo creÃ­,</i>

04:37.958 --> 04:39.525
<i>pero entonces me caÃ­</i>

04:39.593 --> 04:41.494
<i>contra la mÃ¡quina de dulces,
ay, ay, ay!</i>

04:42.563 --> 04:44.497
<i>And now,</i>

04:44.565 --> 04:47.934
Valerie and Dave will
deliver their own vows,

04:48.002 --> 04:51.738
because my vows, apparently,
weren't good enough.

04:51.805 --> 04:54.507
Show me how it's done, Dave.

04:54.575 --> 04:56.042
"Valerie,

04:56.110 --> 04:57.577
even though you're a Starbucks girl,

04:57.645 --> 04:59.445
and I'm a Seattle's best guy,

04:59.513 --> 05:02.115
I know we can focus on the
things we have in common...

05:02.182 --> 05:03.950
like Mad Men, season two!"

05:05.552 --> 05:06.653
I give it a year.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.022
Homer! Where are you?

05:09.089 --> 05:10.356
I'm almost there.

05:10.424 --> 05:11.691
I can see the church
steeple in the distance.

05:13.193 --> 05:15.128
Uh-oh! Here comes a train.

05:25.472 --> 05:28.007
Tickets, please.

05:28.075 --> 05:29.475
Hey, where's your ticket?

05:29.543 --> 05:31.044
Leave me alone!

05:31.111 --> 05:32.645
Why you little...

05:32.713 --> 05:34.080
No, don't do it, sir!

05:34.148 --> 05:35.548
He's strangling me! I'm gonna choke!

05:37.985 --> 05:39.786
Good evening, Mr. Homer, how can I...?

05:39.853 --> 05:41.154
No time to pretend we're friends!

05:41.221 --> 05:42.221
Lotto me!

05:42.289 --> 05:45.491
"1-6-17-22-24-35."

05:45.559 --> 05:47.593
I did it! I'm gonna make it!

05:54.935 --> 05:56.836
Â¶ You like potato... Â¶

05:59.139 --> 06:02.875
Â¶ You like tomato... Â¶

06:04.845 --> 06:07.447
Â¶ Potato... Â¶

06:07.514 --> 06:10.550
Â¶ Tomato... Â¶

06:10.617 --> 06:12.919
Â¶ Let's call the whole thing... Â¶

06:15.622 --> 06:17.924
I'm a-comin', Marge!

06:19.059 --> 06:20.293
Let him go, Lou.

06:20.361 --> 06:23.029
Someone going that fast
has no time for a ticket.

06:24.832 --> 06:26.666
Okay, who's ready

06:26.734 --> 06:30.436
for a wedding-themed knock-knock joke?

06:30.504 --> 06:31.437
Whoa!

06:31.505 --> 06:32.805
Start the joke!

06:32.873 --> 06:34.173
Um, knock-knock?

06:34.241 --> 06:36.075
Who's there? I don't know.

06:36.143 --> 06:37.844
Did I hear "lettuce"?

06:37.911 --> 06:39.212
Not from me, you didn't.

06:39.279 --> 06:40.880
Lettuce who?

06:40.948 --> 06:42.915
I don't know!

06:44.518 --> 06:46.619
Don't drag your kid into this!

06:46.687 --> 06:47.887
Lettuce...

06:47.955 --> 06:50.089
congratulate the new couple.

06:50.157 --> 06:52.925
Why won't she stop?!

06:54.895 --> 06:56.829
There, there. There, there, sweetie.

06:58.132 --> 06:59.065
I'm gonna make it!

06:59.133 --> 07:00.633
I'm gonna make it!

07:02.169 --> 07:04.837
I didn't make it?

07:08.976 --> 07:12.278
Here I am, about to start
my new life in Springfield!

07:13.781 --> 07:15.047
What an idiot!

07:15.115 --> 07:17.350
This is the perfect
time for my catchphrase:

07:17.418 --> 07:20.253
"Soon you will be mi..."

07:27.861 --> 07:29.061
Homie?

07:29.129 --> 07:31.431
Homie, can you hear me?

07:31.498 --> 07:35.501
Oh, thank God, you're okay!

07:35.569 --> 07:37.003
I'm alive!

07:37.070 --> 07:39.972
And surrounded by the people
I love the most in the...

07:40.040 --> 07:41.474
Could you scooch over a bit?

07:41.542 --> 07:43.476
Our top story:

07:43.544 --> 07:46.913
last night's big Lotto winner
has still not come forward.

07:46.980 --> 07:51.884
Once again, those numbers are:
1-6-17-22-24 and 35.

07:51.952 --> 07:54.520
<i>A million dollars!</i>

07:54.588 --> 07:56.722
<i>Now I'm really glad I didn't die!</i>

07:56.790 --> 07:58.458
The mysterious
winner purchased the ticket

07:58.525 --> 08:00.827
at 7:07 last night.

08:00.894 --> 08:02.495
7:07?

08:02.563 --> 08:05.031
That's exactly the moment
I was furious at you

08:05.098 --> 08:06.532
for missing our toast.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.068
And now I'm the one who has to ask:

08:09.136 --> 08:11.137
can you forgive me?

08:11.205 --> 08:12.805
Oh, I'll try.

08:12.873 --> 08:13.840
<i>Wait!</i>

08:13.907 --> 08:15.708
<i>If I tell Marge I won,</i>

08:15.776 --> 08:17.643
<i>she'll know I was buying the ticket</i>

08:17.711 --> 08:19.812
<i>when I was supposed
to be onstage with her.</i>

08:19.880 --> 08:22.615
<i>Oh, I'm rich and I can't
even tell my own wife!</i>

08:24.451 --> 08:25.618
<i>Calm down, Homer.</i>

08:25.686 --> 08:27.320
<i>Calm down.</i>

08:30.757 --> 08:33.092
<i>Wow, I do look pretty
calm down there.</i>

08:42.924 --> 08:45.525
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Orchard Avenue Kwik-E-Mart,

08:45.742 --> 08:47.877
birthplace of the
yardstick on the doorframe

08:47.945 --> 08:49.879
that tells you how tall your robber was,

08:49.947 --> 08:52.582
is proud to announce its
latest Lotto victor.

08:52.649 --> 08:54.517
Mr. Barney Gumble!

08:54.585 --> 08:56.085
Mm-hmm!

08:56.153 --> 08:58.087
That's right!
I bought the winning ticket!

08:58.155 --> 09:00.857
And now I can buy
back all the blood I sold!

09:03.026 --> 09:04.026
Mm-hmm!

09:04.094 --> 09:06.229
Actually, after taxes,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.097
the amount you will receive is...

09:10.133 --> 09:13.269
This money will go to partially
cover the cost of a study

09:13.337 --> 09:15.671
to decide what to do with the money.

09:24.515 --> 09:27.450
Barn, thanks for picking
up the money for me.

09:30.087 --> 09:32.021
Now, what should I buy first?

09:32.089 --> 09:33.389
Hitler's baseball?

09:33.457 --> 09:36.092
A mirror that gives me advice?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.227
My advice is to buy Hitler's baseball.

09:38.295 --> 09:39.595
Wait a minute, Homer!

09:39.663 --> 09:41.197
You can't spend any of that money

09:41.265 --> 09:43.032
or Marge will know you lied.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.734
Oh, yeah.

09:47.938 --> 09:49.505
Marge, what are you doing?

09:49.573 --> 09:51.040
The laundry.

09:51.108 --> 09:52.642
The machine's on the fritz,

09:52.709 --> 09:55.711
and we can't afford the $400 to fix it.

09:57.581 --> 09:59.248
Here I am a millionaire,

09:59.316 --> 10:01.951
and I can't even help the
woman who gave birth to me.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.887
Why don't you just buy
things your family needs,

10:04.955 --> 10:07.089
and leave them where they'll find them?

10:07.157 --> 10:09.091
Oh, Barney, that's brilliant!

10:09.159 --> 10:10.893
Just for that, you can help yourself

10:10.961 --> 10:12.795
to anything from this tree.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.263
That's not the money tree.

10:14.331 --> 10:15.631
I know.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.968
It's where I hide my adult magazines.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.937
Ooh...!

10:24.441 --> 10:26.642
Oh, wow!

10:29.012 --> 10:31.847
All right, it's all hooked up.

10:35.786 --> 10:37.219
This isn't normal tv.

10:37.287 --> 10:38.788
It's a video game that encourages

10:38.855 --> 10:40.423
activity and exercise.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.126
Please, at least try the tennis game.

10:46.163 --> 10:47.997
Hmm...

10:48.065 --> 10:50.700
My puppet... with this
wand I control it how...

10:50.767 --> 10:52.234
by jumping?

10:52.302 --> 10:54.003
You use the wand like a tennis racket

10:54.071 --> 10:56.572
to hit an invisible ball.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.240
Look at me!

10:58.308 --> 11:00.242
I'm big Bill Tilden!

11:00.310 --> 11:03.112
I think I'm looking at a poop later.

11:03.180 --> 11:03.846
Hey!

11:08.819 --> 11:11.320
Catch, boy!

11:12.689 --> 11:14.790
Oops, the frisbee went into the bushes.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.525
Why don't you go find it?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.160
You threw it, you go find it.

11:18.228 --> 11:20.296
Why, you little...

11:20.364 --> 11:21.430
Ow!

11:21.498 --> 11:23.032
There's a big box in here!

11:23.100 --> 11:25.267
A box? No way!

11:26.436 --> 11:28.371
A new washing machine?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.639
No way!

11:29.706 --> 11:32.208
That's just what we need!

11:32.275 --> 11:34.010
But how are going to get it home?

11:34.077 --> 11:36.912
You, go rent us a truck.

11:38.615 --> 11:39.949
Ow!

12:33.103 --> 12:34.603
And now, Marge's secret benefactor

12:34.671 --> 12:37.273
is going to get her the luxury
she's always dreamed of:

12:37.340 --> 12:40.643
a toaster wide enough for bagels.

12:40.711 --> 12:44.180
I'll just take out a little
money from my "local branch."

12:45.615 --> 12:48.451
Hmm... Not as much money
as there used to be.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.086
Homer? What are you doing? Huh?

12:50.153 --> 12:51.587
Why... I'm just...

12:53.724 --> 12:55.658
Ow...!

12:55.726 --> 12:57.760
Yow...!

12:57.828 --> 13:00.362
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

13:01.898 --> 13:03.866
There's money in this tree.

13:03.934 --> 13:05.201
What the hell is going on?

13:05.268 --> 13:07.002
Lenny... and Carl...

13:07.070 --> 13:08.704
a fortune cookie...

13:08.772 --> 13:11.874
and then I ran into the candy machine,

13:11.942 --> 13:14.276
and I... I found an Emerson,
Lake & Palmer...

13:14.344 --> 13:16.212
and there was a...

13:16.279 --> 13:19.215
Â¶ Ooh-wee, bah-doo, bah-doo,
bah-doo, bah-doo, bah-doo. Â¶

13:19.282 --> 13:20.983
Â¶ Bah-doo... Â¶

13:23.908 --> 13:27.009
Okay, let me get this straight:
you got all this moola,

13:27.076 --> 13:28.577
legitimately, but you're too scared

13:28.645 --> 13:30.245
to do anything fun with it?

13:30.313 --> 13:32.247
Son, if I was interested in fun,

13:32.315 --> 13:34.950
I would've run away
the day you were born.

13:35.018 --> 13:36.952
Look, man, you've got to
enjoy yourself a little.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.522
You work hard, or at least
you're out of the house a lot.

13:40.590 --> 13:42.057
You're right.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.593
I have been acting like
telethon Jerry Lewis

13:44.661 --> 13:46.128
when I should've been acting

13:46.196 --> 13:47.429
like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis.

13:47.497 --> 13:49.698
Will you teach me
how to put myself first?

13:49.766 --> 13:51.733
And how!

13:51.801 --> 13:53.435
Not so fast!

13:54.537 --> 13:56.138
Don't forget my cut.

13:56.206 --> 13:58.106
Uh... your cut of what?

13:58.174 --> 13:59.975
I don't know.
I just go around saying that,

14:00.043 --> 14:01.743
In the hope it'll be applicable.

14:01.811 --> 14:03.478
I'll be on my way now.

14:03.546 --> 14:04.646
<i>On my way...</i>

14:10.453 --> 14:11.854
- Â¶ Oh... Â¶
- Wait!

14:11.921 --> 14:14.022
I have to go to the bathroom!

14:16.559 --> 14:18.927
So, where are you from, Homer?

14:18.995 --> 14:19.962
Here.

14:20.797 --> 14:22.164
Mm-hmm!

14:22.232 --> 14:23.332
Â¶ Oh... Â¶

14:23.399 --> 14:24.366
Wait!

14:24.434 --> 14:25.434
Yes, Homer?

14:25.501 --> 14:26.902
Do you think you could

14:26.970 --> 14:28.704
use someone like me in your band?

14:28.771 --> 14:29.705
Yeah, come on up.

14:29.772 --> 14:30.973
You can play the tambourine.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.476
I said someone like me, I didn't say me.

14:34.544 --> 14:38.313
Â¶ Oh, oh oh... Â¶

14:38.381 --> 14:39.748
Here we go, folks,

14:39.816 --> 14:42.851
the ultimate zero gravity experience!

14:44.087 --> 14:45.354
Look at me!

14:45.421 --> 14:46.622
I'm flying,

14:46.689 --> 14:48.323
like Superman's dog!

14:48.391 --> 14:49.625
Race you to the cockpit!

15:00.370 --> 15:02.170
I'm gonna call you Benson and Hedges

15:02.238 --> 15:04.706
'cause you're gettin' smoked!

15:08.244 --> 15:09.811
Lisa, thanks to your new whatsis,

15:09.879 --> 15:11.146
we're as fit as fiddles.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.447
Nurse!

15:12.515 --> 15:15.150
Another round of waters
in your finest paper cups!

15:20.390 --> 15:22.424
I'm gonna need a little
Bengay for this shoulder.

15:22.492 --> 15:25.827
I'd like a fresh pair of socks tomorrow.

15:25.895 --> 15:27.062
A matching pair.

15:27.130 --> 15:28.830
I want to put salt on things!

15:28.898 --> 15:30.365
Tell me what my name is!

15:30.433 --> 15:31.667
Take away my roommate!

15:31.734 --> 15:32.868
He's dead!

15:34.771 --> 15:36.805
<i>Folks, it's time for our final run.</i>

15:36.873 --> 15:38.273
No way!

15:38.341 --> 15:39.975
I want to go a million more times!

15:40.043 --> 15:41.076
Sorry, boy.

15:41.144 --> 15:42.344
You have school tomorrow.

15:42.412 --> 15:44.079
Rich kids don't need school!

15:44.147 --> 15:46.114
When I grow up, you can
buy an apartment building

15:46.182 --> 15:47.416
and make me the super.

15:47.483 --> 15:48.583
With that attitude,

15:48.651 --> 15:50.585
you'll never super
in one of my buildings!

15:50.653 --> 15:53.021
Boy, I am through spoiling you.

15:53.089 --> 15:54.589
First thing tomorrow, you're going back

15:54.657 --> 15:56.491
to the rotten life
you've always enjoyed.

15:56.559 --> 15:57.793
Oh, yeah?

15:57.860 --> 15:59.361
If you don't keep splashing the cash,

15:59.429 --> 16:01.229
I'm gonna tell mom
that it's thanks to you

16:01.297 --> 16:03.532
she made the first
bad wedding toast ever.

16:04.767 --> 16:07.769
Blackmail your
father in space, will you?!

16:10.006 --> 16:11.139
D'oh!

16:16.746 --> 16:18.680
Oh... D'oh!

16:18.748 --> 16:19.982
D'oh!

16:26.923 --> 16:28.223
Why is the tv back on?

16:28.291 --> 16:29.591
What happened to the video game?

16:29.659 --> 16:31.126
Oh, the video game.

16:31.194 --> 16:32.527
You'd think it'd be dishwasher safe,

16:32.595 --> 16:33.929
but it wasn't.

16:33.997 --> 16:36.498
Why would you put it in the dishwasher?

16:39.168 --> 16:40.736
You ruined it on purpose.

16:40.803 --> 16:42.804
You want the old folks to be zombies,

16:42.872 --> 16:44.506
because it makes your jobs easier!

16:44.574 --> 16:47.642
Ooh, excuse us.

16:47.710 --> 16:50.746
We tried to make the worst
job in the world easier.

16:50.813 --> 16:53.415
Well, I agree it's not the most
pleasant job in the world...

16:53.483 --> 16:55.884
Don't forget the low pay and
the constant presence of death.

16:55.952 --> 16:58.286
Well, you still should have
let them have their fun!

16:58.354 --> 17:01.023
They should've had their
fun before they got here.

17:06.829 --> 17:08.997
Who's ready for <i>panini</i> ?

17:09.065 --> 17:10.565
Up... that's my chair, boy.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.000
No problem.

17:12.068 --> 17:14.502
I'll just sit here, closer to mom's ear.

17:14.569 --> 17:18.373
Mom, how do you think we
really got that <i>panini</i> press?

17:18.441 --> 17:20.175
I thought the government sent it to us

17:20.242 --> 17:21.910
as part of the stimulus package.

17:21.978 --> 17:23.278
At least that's what the letter said.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.982
Well, actually, mom...

17:27.050 --> 17:29.184
Uh! On second thought, boy,

17:29.252 --> 17:31.953
why don't you take my chair?

17:32.021 --> 17:35.490
So, Bart, how's your big school
presentation coming along?

17:35.558 --> 17:37.959
Oh, great, now that
dad's gonna star in it.

17:38.027 --> 17:39.428
I agreed to no such thing!

17:39.495 --> 17:40.996
Mom...

17:41.064 --> 17:42.931
- Where and what time?
- Homeroom, 8:00 a.m.

17:42.999 --> 17:44.666
- Never!
- Mom...

17:44.734 --> 17:46.268
What do I wear?

17:46.335 --> 17:48.236
Behold, Neanderthal man,

17:48.304 --> 17:50.305
our ugliest, stupidest ancestor.

17:51.674 --> 17:54.476
Come on, missing link, put on a show.

17:59.649 --> 18:00.882
Make a fire!

18:00.950 --> 18:02.184
Be scared of the fire!

18:02.251 --> 18:03.718
Evolve! Evolve!

18:03.786 --> 18:05.153
Get religious about a bird you see!

18:06.522 --> 18:08.290
Sprain your ankle and know
it's a death sentence!

18:12.195 --> 18:13.695
Very good, Bart.

18:13.763 --> 18:15.630
Can I get extra credit for
a caveman break dance?

18:15.698 --> 18:16.932
Of course.

18:29.047 --> 18:31.483
Homer, I need you to rickshaw
me to soccer practice.

18:33.551 --> 18:35.018
Fine.

18:35.085 --> 18:37.353
Let me just get my harness pads.

18:37.421 --> 18:38.955
No time.

18:46.997 --> 18:48.532
Boy, this has gone too far!

18:48.599 --> 18:49.866
I quit!

18:49.934 --> 18:51.401
Soon as I finish these oats.

18:51.469 --> 18:52.736
Hey, hey, hey.

18:52.803 --> 18:53.970
Let's not get crazy.

18:54.038 --> 18:55.906
If you quit, I'm telling mom everything.

18:55.973 --> 18:57.774
Not if I tell her first.

19:01.078 --> 19:03.813
Now how am I supposed to
get to soccer practice?

19:03.881 --> 19:05.916
Hey, Milhouse, want a
turn pulling my rickshaw?

19:05.983 --> 19:07.951
Okay, but just 'cause
I'm your best friend,

19:08.019 --> 19:10.787
don't be afraid to use that whip.

19:10.855 --> 19:14.524
Okay, I'm taking off the blindfold.

19:14.592 --> 19:16.593
Surprised?

19:16.661 --> 19:18.161
Well, I kind of got a clue

19:18.229 --> 19:20.330
When I heard that
"ballooning safety" video.

19:20.398 --> 19:23.333
Marge, soaring above the
forgiving beauty of nature,

19:23.401 --> 19:25.835
I have something to confess.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.905
Um... I wasn't there
for that wedding toast

19:28.973 --> 19:31.541
because I was buying a lottery ticket.

19:31.609 --> 19:32.776
You were what?!

19:32.843 --> 19:34.778
You have a right to be angry. Furious!

19:34.845 --> 19:37.247
And even though that ticket
won a million dollars...

19:37.315 --> 19:39.249
We've got a million dollars?!

19:39.317 --> 19:40.850
Screw the toast!

19:40.918 --> 19:42.619
Uh, yes, well, um...

19:42.687 --> 19:44.487
Taxes took out a lot,

19:44.555 --> 19:47.123
I spent a ton on those
things for the family,

19:47.191 --> 19:50.060
and, um, I didn't know
you could rent a balloon.

19:50.127 --> 19:51.795
So we're right back

19:51.862 --> 19:53.830
where we used to be.

19:53.898 --> 19:57.033
Yes, but I have one
more thing to show you.

19:57.101 --> 20:01.037
Oh... my... God!

20:01.105 --> 20:02.973
Marge, those groves of cherry blossoms

20:03.040 --> 20:05.008
will bloom every year,

20:05.076 --> 20:07.210
to remind the world of the sweetest,

20:07.278 --> 20:09.779
most forgiving woman who ever lived.

20:09.847 --> 20:11.848
Am I off the hook?

20:11.916 --> 20:15.085
Â¶ You like potato Â¶

20:15.152 --> 20:18.521
Â¶ And you like po-tah-to Â¶

20:18.589 --> 20:21.524
Â¶ You like tomato Â¶

20:21.592 --> 20:24.995
Â¶ And you like to-mah-to Â¶

20:25.062 --> 20:28.031
Â¶ So if you go for oysters Â¶

20:28.099 --> 20:29.466
Â¶ and I go for ersters Â¶

20:29.533 --> 20:31.534
Â¶ I'll order oysters Â¶

20:31.602 --> 20:33.370
Â¶ and cancel the ersters Â¶

20:33.437 --> 20:37.007
Â¶ For we know we
need each other, so we Â¶

20:37.074 --> 20:40.343
Â¶ better call the calling off off Â¶

20:40.411 --> 20:45.282
Â¶ Let's call the whole thing off! Â¶
