01:45.519 --> 01:47.037
Ah.

01:47.141 --> 01:50.455
I know it's a lot to ask.

01:50.558 --> 01:54.217
I do have a bit of a thing
I have to deal with first.

01:54.321 --> 01:57.634
Post-Adam situation.

01:57.738 --> 01:59.464
Right.

01:59.567 --> 02:00.913
I had no idea.

02:01.017 --> 02:03.640
Ah, it's nothing.

Because I've already
slept through the appropriate

02:27.354 --> 02:29.010
cancellation window,
and she's probably already

02:29.114 --> 02:31.012
on her way by now, and...

02:31.116 --> 02:33.049
I got to go to school, anyway.
It'll be fine.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.051
And whose idea was it
to have breakfast

02:35.155 --> 02:36.604
in the first place?

02:36.708 --> 02:39.228
Yours or Tahlia's?

02:39.331 --> 02:41.575
I've got nothing.
No memory.

02:41.678 --> 02:43.473
It was probably me.

02:43.577 --> 02:45.717
Although, we basically
went toe to toe.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.443
She was pretty messy.

02:51.516 --> 02:52.862
How do you
look that good?

02:52.965 --> 02:55.071
I took my make-up off
before I went to bed.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.797
Nah, there's got to be
more to it than that.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.626
Why?
What happened to you?

03:01.319 --> 03:02.561
So, I got home and I -

03:02.665 --> 03:04.839
Dan, look at me.

03:04.943 --> 03:06.220
Mm.
Take them off.

03:08.636 --> 03:11.156
Ow! My God!
Make that stop!

03:12.433 --> 03:13.503
Paige, open the door.

03:13.607 --> 03:14.608
Door. Door, door.

03:14.711 --> 03:16.161
Open the door.

03:18.163 --> 03:19.544
That was quick!

03:19.647 --> 03:21.649
Um...it's in there.
I lost track of the sausages.

03:21.753 --> 03:22.961
We're from ASADA.

03:23.064 --> 03:25.860
We're here to spot test
Daniel Fletcher.

03:25.964 --> 03:28.449
On the bright side,

03:28.553 --> 03:30.348
an ASADA raid means
that he's smashing it.

03:30.451 --> 03:31.866
They only ever bother
with the top players.

03:31.970 --> 03:33.040
Good to know.

03:33.143 --> 03:35.456
You want more coffee?

03:35.560 --> 03:37.113
Ah, no, no,
I've got to get going.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.804
You spent all last night

03:38.908 --> 03:40.254
bragging that
you didn't have to work today.

03:40.358 --> 03:42.014
Oh, I'm not teaching.
I just want to do

03:42.118 --> 03:43.050
the right thing, get on
the right foot

03:43.153 --> 03:44.707
re that
Yasmin situation.

03:44.810 --> 03:46.571
Yeah, you better get
ahead of that one.

03:46.674 --> 03:49.574
She was sneaky.

03:49.677 --> 03:50.609
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't worry, I...

03:50.713 --> 03:52.128
I got the bill.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.957
And when you win whatever
prize you get for teaching,

03:54.061 --> 03:55.200
you can pay me back.

03:55.304 --> 03:57.029
There are no prizes
for teaching.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.342
Are there any incentives?Not really.

03:59.446 --> 04:00.378
Just, you know,
shaping the minds

04:00.481 --> 04:02.172
of our future
generations.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.002
You know, you and I really have
a lot more in common

04:04.105 --> 04:05.452
than I first thought.

04:05.555 --> 04:06.763
Hm!

04:20.329 --> 04:22.331
Hey.

04:22.434 --> 04:23.746
Where have you been?

04:23.849 --> 04:26.852
I thought you were supposed
to be sleeping in.

04:26.956 --> 04:28.337
Is that what
I think it is?

04:28.440 --> 04:29.510
Uh, don't know.

04:29.614 --> 04:32.306
Do you think it's coffee
and pastries?

04:32.410 --> 04:33.652
Think it might be.

04:33.756 --> 04:36.206
Oh!

04:39.796 --> 04:41.660
What else
you got in there?

04:41.764 --> 04:43.213
Well, um...

04:43.317 --> 04:45.595
apparently this has
the technology to

04:45.699 --> 04:48.874
relieve backaches,
swelling feet, and reflux.

04:48.978 --> 04:51.291
Right.

04:51.394 --> 04:55.571
These were made ethically in
Nepal and were blessed

04:55.674 --> 04:57.297
by a gang of monks.A gang of monks.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.953
Is that the collective
term for monks?

04:59.057 --> 05:00.783
Yeah, it is.

05:00.886 --> 05:04.407
And this guy...

05:04.511 --> 05:06.098
is for you.

05:06.202 --> 05:09.309
Mm.

05:11.552 --> 05:16.281
You two get the royal treatment
for the next six months.

05:16.385 --> 05:18.904
And what happens
after that?

05:19.008 --> 05:21.666
Well, you go back to standard
rations and 12-hour days

05:21.769 --> 05:23.909
waiting on me
hand and foot.

05:27.257 --> 05:28.569
What are you doing now?

05:28.673 --> 05:30.882
You got some sort of
massage treatment, or...?

05:30.985 --> 05:32.677
Oh, no, no, no.
I am preparing to launch

05:32.780 --> 05:34.748
my new men's
fragrance line.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.232
Connor by Tahlia.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.613
Is there a big market
for that sort of thing?

05:37.716 --> 05:39.062
Oh, huge.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.616
It really is the only
upside to all the ladies

05:40.719 --> 05:42.065
out there fantasizing about
our men. Thank you.

05:42.169 --> 05:44.447
Would they still if they
really got to know them?

05:44.551 --> 05:46.276
Probably not as many.
But my point is,

05:46.380 --> 05:49.107
do not shy away
from a potential cash return.

05:49.210 --> 05:51.834
I mean, if it brightens up
someone's day to think they know

05:51.937 --> 05:53.939
what Connor smells like
or, even better,

05:54.043 --> 05:56.839
helps them imagine that
their man smells like Connor,

05:56.942 --> 05:58.254
it's almost
a public service.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.980
Is it, though?
Totally!

06:00.083 --> 06:01.775
And if you didn't go
and delete all your socials,

06:01.878 --> 06:03.777
you, too, could be making
the world a better place.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.330
You're smart and fresh.

06:05.434 --> 06:07.746
You should be working out
how to play to your strengths.

06:07.850 --> 06:09.921
Find your brand
and make some extra money.

06:10.024 --> 06:11.785
I'm gonna stick
with a definite no.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.652
Some of the boys got a visit
from ASADA last night.

06:16.755 --> 06:20.069
Ooh, lucky you're
not playing well.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.243
You -- you would be
if you weren't injured.

06:22.347 --> 06:23.900
Yeah.

06:24.004 --> 06:26.765
I've got to tell someone
about the pills I gave Jack.

06:29.216 --> 06:30.700
Who?

06:30.804 --> 06:32.530
Jessie or Brian?

06:32.633 --> 06:35.291
I've got to do
something.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.568
What?

06:36.672 --> 06:38.501
I'm not sure.No, it was my fault.

06:38.605 --> 06:40.952
You know?
If I hadn't given it to him...

06:42.643 --> 06:43.851
You said
it was months ago.

06:43.955 --> 06:45.439
Yeah, and what's that
got to do with anything?

06:45.543 --> 06:47.924
I'm not sure what
telling Jessie will achieve.

06:50.340 --> 06:53.240
Might make me
feel better.

06:53.343 --> 06:57.244
I just
can't sit on this.

06:57.347 --> 06:58.797
Maybe talk to Brian.

06:58.901 --> 07:01.179
Yeah, well, I...

07:01.282 --> 07:03.215
-Oh!
-We are going to the market.

07:03.319 --> 07:05.355
The children and I
are making macarons.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.634
Also, you both asked me
to remind you

07:07.737 --> 07:09.463
that I will be taking
personal time this weekend.

07:09.567 --> 07:10.568
Sorry, did we know that?

07:10.671 --> 07:11.672
Yes.
Yes.

07:11.776 --> 07:13.260
Well, um...

07:13.363 --> 07:14.364
Sorry,
you approved this?

07:14.468 --> 07:15.573
-You both did.
-So did you!

07:15.676 --> 07:17.609
You were a bit,
uh, tired.

07:17.713 --> 07:18.955
Oh.

07:19.059 --> 07:21.648
Um, so, how long
will you be gone?

07:21.751 --> 07:23.443
A few days.

07:23.546 --> 07:25.410
Would you like anything
in particular from the market?

07:25.514 --> 07:26.480
Wait!

07:26.584 --> 07:28.206
Um...Aside from coffee.

07:28.309 --> 07:29.656
Ooh, what are
those little,

07:29.759 --> 07:31.105
uh, cookie things
that you got last time?

07:31.209 --> 07:32.866
The maple shortbread.Oh, my God. Yes.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.006
Oh, they were so good.They were amazing.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.214
Let's go!

07:37.664 --> 07:39.562
Why would you give her
time off?!

07:44.774 --> 07:47.156
I got to pick up JJ
from the baby sitter.

07:49.572 --> 07:50.746
Hey.
Hm?

07:55.267 --> 07:58.408
I want to
look after you, Jess.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.410
And JJ.
Mm.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.275
All three of you.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.277
And it'd be a lot easier
to do that

08:05.381 --> 08:07.797
if we were
in the same city.

08:07.901 --> 08:09.247
So move back.

08:09.350 --> 08:12.837
You know I can't till
I finish my fellowship.

08:12.940 --> 08:14.632
And I don't want to wait
another four months.

08:14.735 --> 08:16.288
Me either.
Then...

08:16.392 --> 08:18.912
come to Queensland
with me.

08:19.015 --> 08:20.569
Uh...

08:22.778 --> 08:24.711
You look terrified.

08:24.814 --> 08:26.436
No, um...

08:26.540 --> 08:29.232
but...

08:29.336 --> 08:31.407
I don't know if we can.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.236
Our whole world is here.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.583
I know.

08:34.686 --> 08:37.517
But if you made
sunny Far North Queensland

08:37.620 --> 08:38.518
your home...

08:38.621 --> 08:40.692
Our home,

08:40.796 --> 08:43.695
all this media stuff
could just disappear.

08:53.463 --> 08:56.225
Hey.Lauren: Good morning.

08:56.328 --> 09:00.160
So, I can't get a hold of Rusty,
and he wasn't at home

09:00.263 --> 09:02.127
when ASADA
popped in at 3:00 a.m.

09:02.231 --> 09:03.543
That's probably
not a bad thing.

09:03.646 --> 09:05.510
God knows what
they would've found.

09:08.513 --> 09:09.756
How are you?

09:09.859 --> 09:11.654
I'm okay.

09:11.758 --> 09:12.828
You?

09:12.931 --> 09:14.036
Not good.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.696
Hey, sorry to interrupt.It's alright, mate.

09:18.799 --> 09:19.938
I can come back.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.457
No. Actually,
I've got a meeting.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.114
Do you need something?I was actually after Brian.

09:23.217 --> 09:24.287
Perfect.

09:24.391 --> 09:25.979
He's all yours.

09:28.775 --> 09:30.086
What's happening?

09:30.190 --> 09:32.157
A few months ago
when I popped my shoulder,

09:32.261 --> 09:35.920
I was taking oxycodone,
and I gave a couple to Jack.

09:36.023 --> 09:38.474
And some of
Maddy's Xanax.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.165
Rusty told me they were
both found in Jack's body

09:40.269 --> 09:42.685
when he died.

09:42.789 --> 09:44.722
So, now I just want
to get it out there,

09:44.825 --> 09:47.483
own up to it,
and face the consequences.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.243
What consequences?I don't know.

09:49.347 --> 09:51.556
I fucked up, and I made
the wrong call.

09:51.660 --> 09:54.490
Mate, there's nothing
any one of us could have done.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.837
Look, if you want to tell
the police or anyone else,

09:56.941 --> 09:58.805
that's your choice,

09:58.908 --> 10:01.531
but it's not
gonna change anything.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.742
And blaming yourself
is not gonna help either.

10:09.263 --> 10:10.437
I've got to take
this, mate. Sorry.

10:10.540 --> 10:11.921
Yeah.
We'll talk again.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.854
Yeah.

10:13.958 --> 10:15.028
Andrew.

10:22.449 --> 10:24.624
I haven't been answering
your calls for a reason.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.073
Connor: Yep, Kath,
it's fine.

10:26.177 --> 10:27.557
It's just that...Yeah, okay.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.421
It doesn't matter why,
the calls have to stop.

10:29.525 --> 10:31.320
Okay, but I...Connor, please,

10:31.423 --> 10:33.149
just don't call again.

10:38.396 --> 10:40.156
Emergency meeting.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.124
You were trying to tell me
you were at my front door?

10:42.227 --> 10:43.470
Again.Okay, you and I need

10:43.573 --> 10:45.299
to have a chat about what
happened in the car.

10:45.403 --> 10:48.026
Well, maybe you should stop
hanging up on my calls.

10:48.130 --> 10:49.579
-Andrew.
-Kath.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.305
Hey, babe.
Hey.

10:56.034 --> 10:58.105
Neil Murray's
been in touch.

10:58.209 --> 11:01.971
Pretty pleased with himself,
little prick.

11:02.075 --> 11:06.666
Reckons Rusty came out
to him this morning.

11:06.769 --> 11:09.876
Apparently, he's gay.

11:09.979 --> 11:12.602
Connor, you're telling me
you had no clue?

11:12.706 --> 11:14.915
No. I...

11:15.019 --> 11:16.606
He slept
with so many women.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.608
I-I had no idea.What I want to know is,

11:18.712 --> 11:20.783
why he would pull
a stunt like this

11:20.887 --> 11:22.302
without going
through us.

11:22.405 --> 11:25.201
Andrew, it's not a stunt.
It's a personal statement.

11:26.582 --> 11:28.239
He obviously wanted
to do it alone.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.448
God forbid
he lets us manage it.

11:30.551 --> 11:32.036
Maybe he didn't want to
be managed.

11:32.139 --> 11:34.866
He has shown no regard
for this club's reputation.

11:34.970 --> 11:38.111
Now that prick's not
answering calls!

11:38.214 --> 11:39.595
Why is that?

11:39.699 --> 11:40.907
Well, he had something to say
to the media.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.356
Something he felt
he couldn't say to us.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.289
Is it worth
calling Neil?

11:44.393 --> 11:45.532
No point.

11:45.635 --> 11:47.983
He's going to run
this story with

11:48.086 --> 11:49.467
or without
a club statement.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.987
Why don't we make
a joint statement with Rusty?

11:52.090 --> 11:53.782
Show a united front?

11:53.885 --> 11:54.990
Assuming he feels
up to it.

11:55.093 --> 11:56.750
He started
this shit storm.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.718
He's the one that needs
to clean it up.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.720
He needs our support.

12:00.823 --> 12:02.756
Yeah, obviously
he's dealing with a lot.

12:02.860 --> 12:05.241
But we're finally starting
to build some momentum.

12:05.345 --> 12:07.243
We don't need
any distractions now.

12:07.347 --> 12:11.075
And that's exactly
what this is.

12:11.178 --> 12:14.216
Thank God he's not
playing this week.

12:14.319 --> 12:16.114
Are you serious? How do you
think that would look?

12:16.218 --> 12:17.737
The media would have
a field day.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.980
"Jets Drops Champion
Because He's Gay."

12:20.084 --> 12:21.154
That's not what
this is!

12:21.257 --> 12:22.396
That's what it's gonna
look like.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.467
I do not negotiate
with terrorists.

12:24.571 --> 12:27.608
Oh, he's not a terrorist,
Andrew! He's scared.

12:27.712 --> 12:29.956
And right now he's not
talking to anyone.

12:30.059 --> 12:33.373
I need him.

12:33.476 --> 12:34.684
You can't have him.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.686
You hired me to get
this club a flag.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.655
I'm telling you I can't do it
without Rusty.

12:41.450 --> 12:44.453
Fine.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.182
Fine.

12:49.285 --> 12:52.012
Kath: He will kill you
if he finds out.

12:52.116 --> 12:54.946
I know.

12:55.050 --> 12:58.156
For the sake of your fiancé,
your career, my marriage,

12:58.260 --> 13:01.056
and the world order at large,
this has to be the last time you

13:01.159 --> 13:03.817
or I discuss what happened
between us in any way,

13:03.921 --> 13:05.888
shape, or form.

13:07.234 --> 13:08.580
Please tell me
you understand.

13:08.684 --> 13:10.306
Is it that
easy for you?

13:10.410 --> 13:11.825
Nothing about
this is easy,

13:11.929 --> 13:15.104
but there's
no alternative.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.106
I understand.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.798
I'll let you know if I have
any luck tracking down Rusty.

13:18.901 --> 13:20.144
Yeah.
Thanks, mate.

13:20.247 --> 13:21.490
I'll see you
back at the club.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.285
See you there.

13:51.037 --> 13:53.211
Toni, Jim, hi.
Got a minute?

13:53.315 --> 13:54.937
Close the door.
Take a seat.

14:01.702 --> 14:04.947
I'm glad Yasmin's been
to see you.

14:06.155 --> 14:08.157
Did you film Yasmin
on your phone?

14:08.261 --> 14:09.814
Yeah, I caught her
in quite

14:09.918 --> 14:11.540
the compromising position
last night.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.474
Did you or did you not
film Yasmin?

14:14.577 --> 14:16.925
I did.
No, only...

14:17.028 --> 14:18.961
only because she started
filming me first.

14:19.065 --> 14:22.102
You're aware that your position
here is entirely contingent

14:22.206 --> 14:24.035
on your adherence
to school policy?

14:24.139 --> 14:25.934
Of course.Obviously, filming a student

14:26.037 --> 14:28.937
without permission
is unacceptable.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.973
Well, I would never
do anything...

14:31.077 --> 14:34.666
um, untoward with it.

14:34.770 --> 14:37.117
No, I take this
all very seriously.

14:37.221 --> 14:39.948
So much so that I have
no online identity whatsoever.

14:40.051 --> 14:42.433
Well, that's
no longer relevant.

14:42.536 --> 14:45.091
We are unable to offer you
any more work.

14:47.748 --> 14:51.131
I understand my actions
were inappropriate.

14:51.235 --> 14:54.514
Uh, yeah, of course, I read
the school policy...

14:54.617 --> 14:58.276
but I honestly thought
I was doing the right thing.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.209
If there's any way
I can redeem myself...

15:00.313 --> 15:02.315
I'm afraid not.

15:02.418 --> 15:05.318
Unfortunately,
our hands are tied.

15:05.421 --> 15:07.044
Any other questions?

15:09.598 --> 15:11.427
Anything from you, Toni?

15:11.531 --> 15:15.776
Not really.
Just very disappointed.

15:18.676 --> 15:20.195
Okay.

15:27.409 --> 15:29.238
Paige: I made such
a rookie mistake.

15:29.342 --> 15:30.653
I just
crashed and burned

15:30.757 --> 15:32.138
at the only thing
I've ever wanted to do.

15:32.241 --> 15:35.106
Most of my life I thought
I was a teacher.

15:35.210 --> 15:38.109
Turns out I have absolutely
no idea who I am.

15:38.213 --> 15:39.904
You...

15:40.008 --> 15:42.355
you are an incredibly
charming math nerd.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.012
And an expert
beer drinker.

15:45.910 --> 15:47.429
I'm Daniel Fletcher's
girlfriend.

15:47.532 --> 15:48.878
You are so much
more than that.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.466
Yeah, not to
anyone around here.

15:50.570 --> 15:52.848
Well, I reckon you could do
anything you set your mind to.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.540
You should be out there
changing the world.

15:55.644 --> 15:57.680
My friend Tahlia
wants me to, um,

15:57.784 --> 15:59.544
set up my own
social media brand.

15:59.648 --> 16:01.546
You can do that in your sleep.

16:01.650 --> 16:02.962
Yeah, but why
would I want to?

16:03.065 --> 16:05.274
I mean, just the word
"brand" terrifies me.

16:05.378 --> 16:07.104
I still think I don't
really know what it means.

16:07.207 --> 16:08.933
Yeah, I think it has
something to do with, like,

16:09.037 --> 16:10.486
fame and money
and getting free stuff.

16:10.590 --> 16:12.350
I mean, not for me,
obviously because you need

16:12.454 --> 16:14.352
actual followers
for that.

16:14.456 --> 16:15.526
I don't have
any followers either.

16:15.629 --> 16:18.149
Well, I'd follow you.

16:18.253 --> 16:20.358
And, you know, I mean,
so would my dog, Patricia,

16:20.462 --> 16:22.982
who, um, who sadly
has more followers than I do.

16:29.367 --> 16:30.851
Hey.

16:30.955 --> 16:32.543
Why are you
wearing an apron?

16:32.646 --> 16:34.027
'Cause I know
it's your favorite.

16:34.131 --> 16:35.856
It's my second favorite.
Why are you wearing it?

16:35.960 --> 16:37.099
Which one
do you like more?

16:37.203 --> 16:38.376
That -- that one with
the butcher stripes.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.344
Oh.
What's going on?

16:40.447 --> 16:42.622
Well, I saw the panic
in your eyes about

16:42.725 --> 16:44.279
Joanna leaving and I wanted
to cheer you up.

16:44.382 --> 16:46.764
So, I fed
and watered the kids.

16:46.867 --> 16:48.628
Ah.
Mm.

16:48.731 --> 16:51.148
How'd you go with Brian?

16:51.251 --> 16:54.737
Well, he said
it wasn't my fault.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.808
Yeah, because it's not.

16:56.912 --> 16:58.465
He doesn't know that.

16:58.569 --> 17:01.261
Neither do you.
Yes, I do.

17:01.365 --> 17:02.918
And deep down,
you know it, too.

17:07.578 --> 17:08.682
Mm.

17:08.786 --> 17:10.029
The kids are
watching cartoons.

17:10.132 --> 17:13.066
And you're wearing
my second favorite apron.

17:20.694 --> 17:23.628
Mm. No, no, no, no.Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:23.732 --> 17:27.115
I've been trying to get
ahold of this douchebag.

17:29.910 --> 17:31.809
Hi, Marcus.

17:31.912 --> 17:34.294
It is very difficult
with the time zones.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.262
Yes, go ahead.

17:41.439 --> 17:43.752
Do you reckon we've got
anything to worry about?

17:43.855 --> 17:45.374
-What do you mean?
-Like, what else did Rusty

17:45.478 --> 17:46.996
say to Neil?

17:48.860 --> 17:51.518
I think he's got bigger things
on his mind right now.

17:54.245 --> 17:56.385
Brian: I'd like to be perfectly
clear that everyone here

17:56.489 --> 17:59.043
at the Southern Jets
Football Club supports

17:59.147 --> 18:02.184
Rusty O'Reilly and his decision
to come out today.

18:02.288 --> 18:05.222
This is just the beginning of
a very important conversation.

18:05.325 --> 18:08.604
Hopefully, one that inspires
people to be themselves

18:08.708 --> 18:10.986
and be a part of our community.

18:12.332 --> 18:14.955
Uh, Russ is an invaluable part
of the team.

18:15.059 --> 18:17.751
He is a champion of the game,
and he's a great mate.

18:17.855 --> 18:20.685
As far as myself and the rest
of the boys are concerned,

18:20.789 --> 18:23.136
his personal life
doesn't change that.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.174
I would just like to say
on behalf of all our members,

18:26.277 --> 18:28.141
and sponsors...

18:28.245 --> 18:32.766
how proud we are
of Russell.

18:32.870 --> 18:36.356
And we hope his courage
will make our great game

18:36.460 --> 18:40.636
an even more inclusive
place for everyone.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.293
Thanks.Thanks for coming, everyone.

18:42.397 --> 18:43.950
Why isn't Rusty here?

18:44.053 --> 18:46.470
He's taking some time out to be
with family and friends.

18:46.573 --> 18:47.919
Why'd he choose
to come out now?

18:48.023 --> 18:49.335
You'd have
to ask him that.

18:49.438 --> 18:50.750
We're just here to deal
with the fallout.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.717
-And what is the fallout?
-Uh...

18:52.821 --> 18:54.926
cubicles in the showers
for a start.

18:55.030 --> 18:57.584
-What?

18:57.688 --> 18:59.517
What? It was a joke.

18:59.621 --> 19:01.554
Strike that last
comment, boys. Yeah?

19:01.657 --> 19:02.900
Mucking around.
Woman: Mr. MacLeish!

19:03.003 --> 19:04.419
Okay, guys.
Thanks for coming, guys.

19:04.522 --> 19:07.353
We'll call it there.Mr MacLeish, can we just ask...

19:13.497 --> 19:16.534
Paige: Social media's
going off chops.

19:16.638 --> 19:18.433
Everyone's posting about Rusty.

19:18.536 --> 19:21.850
I mean, mostly supportive
but, f...

19:21.953 --> 19:23.369
some are really awful.

19:23.472 --> 19:25.094
They're all just
wankers with too much time

19:25.198 --> 19:27.131
on their hands.Not all of them.

19:27.235 --> 19:28.891
They're your words.

19:28.995 --> 19:30.307
That's a direct quote
from you.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.584
Yeah, okay.

19:31.687 --> 19:32.930
I did say that,
and I'm pretty sure

19:33.033 --> 19:34.207
you agreed with me
at the time.

19:34.311 --> 19:36.554
Yeah, that's 'cause
you were right.

19:36.658 --> 19:38.073
And I'm right now.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.799
This situation's a little more
complex than that.

19:39.902 --> 19:41.145
No, it's not.

19:41.249 --> 19:42.388
Most of these people
are just trying

19:42.491 --> 19:43.492
to show their support.

19:43.596 --> 19:45.322
Yeah, but who
asked them to?

19:45.425 --> 19:47.116
Why are they
weighing in at all?

19:47.220 --> 19:48.497
They don't know him.

19:48.601 --> 19:50.119
I've seen him every day
for the last two months,

19:50.223 --> 19:51.673
I feel like
I hardly know him.

19:51.776 --> 19:53.951
He's just a bloke trying
to play footy and live his life.

19:54.054 --> 19:57.920
"Jack knew Rusty was gay.
That's why he hated him."

19:58.024 --> 20:00.095
Ah, people
are turds.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.338
Yeah.
On so many levels.

20:01.441 --> 20:03.581
It's the same idiots
mouthing off.

20:03.685 --> 20:06.446
You know? No idea what
they're saying, or...

20:06.550 --> 20:07.758
or what it does to us.

20:07.861 --> 20:10.243
Jack wasn't a homophobe.
You know who he was.

20:10.347 --> 20:11.865
You don't need to question
that because of some

20:11.969 --> 20:14.454
small-minded troll.
Mm.

20:16.939 --> 20:19.425
You know,
it's not going away.

20:19.528 --> 20:23.014
I think I need to tell Jess
about the drugs.

20:23.118 --> 20:24.395
You know, Brian says
it won't make a difference,

20:24.499 --> 20:26.570
but I think
she needs to know.

20:31.126 --> 20:34.543
I'm not supposed
to tell you this.

20:34.647 --> 20:36.304
Oh, well, we both know
you're gonna say it.

20:38.306 --> 20:39.962
She's pregnant.

20:45.692 --> 20:48.281
How -- how long
has she known?

20:48.385 --> 20:50.387
Not very long.
She didn't even tell me.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.493
I only found out because I saw
the test in her rubbish bin.

20:53.597 --> 20:56.220
Oh, shit.

20:56.324 --> 20:59.119
She's okay,
but I don't think she needs

20:59.223 --> 21:00.707
anything else to worry
about right now.

21:00.811 --> 21:02.053
Do you?

21:02.157 --> 21:04.435
No.

21:08.612 --> 21:09.889
Where have you been?

21:09.992 --> 21:11.339
Take a guess.

21:11.442 --> 21:12.892
You're supposed to be
learning your lines.

21:12.995 --> 21:14.721
It's one line.
What is it?

21:14.825 --> 21:16.447
I'm not saying it.It's 'cause you don't know it.

21:16.551 --> 21:18.242
No, it's 'cause
I'm refusing to say it.

21:20.969 --> 21:23.765
I saw
the statement on TV.

21:23.868 --> 21:26.181
You spoke beautifully.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.666
And you looked
very handsome.

21:28.770 --> 21:30.530
Got to say, I'm not
surprised about Rusty.

21:30.634 --> 21:32.498
Really?He's never hit on me.

21:32.601 --> 21:33.878
Not once.

21:33.982 --> 21:36.916
I've never even caught him
having a sneaky perv.

21:37.019 --> 21:38.124
Okay.

21:38.227 --> 21:39.539
You know
what that means.

21:39.643 --> 21:42.680
Felzen, Wyatt, Giovanni,
all gay.

21:42.784 --> 21:44.475
Because they
didn't hit on you?

21:44.579 --> 21:46.684
Just mathematically,
there must be hundreds.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.276
Radio Host: It seems everyone
has an opinion on this.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.829
We've got Sandy on the line.

21:53.933 --> 21:55.279
Man: I think Andrew MacLeish's
slip about

21:55.383 --> 21:56.763
getting cubicles
in the shower says it all.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.696
Host: And what
is that, specifically?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.319
It's just that closed
mentality, isn't it?

22:00.422 --> 22:01.803
You know, who wants
to deal with that?

22:01.906 --> 22:03.943
Clearly, O'Reilly wanted
to deal with it,

22:04.046 --> 22:06.117
or he wouldn't
have come out.

22:09.397 --> 22:11.157
Jessie: Why didn't you
talk to me first?

22:11.260 --> 22:12.883
Because I knew you wouldn't
want me to do it.

22:12.986 --> 22:14.954
No, I wouldn't want you
to do it for me.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.336
I was sick of watching you get
beaten up by the press.

22:17.439 --> 22:19.924
Russ, none of this
has ever been about me.

22:20.028 --> 22:22.893
Well, maybe I just wanted 'em
off your back for a minute.

22:29.451 --> 22:32.005
Maybe I needed
an excuse.

22:32.109 --> 22:35.457
I was always gonna do it
sooner or later.

22:35.561 --> 22:37.356
Thank you.

22:38.874 --> 22:41.946
But you didn't have to
disappear like that.

22:42.050 --> 22:43.534
You scared a lot of people.

22:43.638 --> 22:47.711
Yeah, well, the media's
camped out at my house.

22:47.814 --> 22:49.575
Stay here.

22:49.678 --> 22:50.955
You know the whole point's
to prove that

22:51.059 --> 22:52.094
we're not shagging.

22:52.198 --> 22:53.648
As if I'd shag you.

22:53.751 --> 22:55.615
Oh.

22:55.719 --> 22:58.480
Well, I mean,
you are only human.

22:58.584 --> 23:00.827
Ah, you're such a knob.

23:40.142 --> 23:42.110
Hey, did I tell you
that it's my turn to host

23:42.213 --> 23:43.387
the girls
this afternoon?

23:43.491 --> 23:44.975
You did not.

23:45.078 --> 23:47.633
Oh. You should take
the kids out.

23:47.736 --> 23:49.048
Why?

23:49.151 --> 23:50.463
Because I shouldn't have
told you about the baby,

23:50.567 --> 23:52.534
and you cannot
be trusted not to blurt.

23:52.638 --> 23:53.846
Mm, yeah.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.022
What?
Miss Joanna.

23:58.126 --> 23:59.817
I know.
Mm.

23:59.921 --> 24:01.301
Do you think
she's missing us?

24:01.405 --> 24:03.959
Nope.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.205
Aaah!
Who's at the door?!

24:08.308 --> 24:10.138
Okay, okay.
Stand back, stand back!

24:10.241 --> 24:12.692
Good.

24:12.796 --> 24:14.832
Hey, hey, buddy!

24:14.936 --> 24:17.214
How you going?
How are things?

24:17.317 --> 24:18.318
I've got something
for you.

24:18.422 --> 24:19.458
Oh, you like that guy,
do you?

24:19.561 --> 24:20.666
Oh!

24:20.769 --> 24:21.805
Alright, let's go play
with him then.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.118
He's got plenty of toys.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.295
And who are you
supposed to be?

24:29.398 --> 24:31.159
Uh, g'day, Rusty.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.332
Nate.

24:34.058 --> 24:36.751
Um, who wants coffee?Yeah.

24:36.854 --> 24:38.373
Yeah, I'll take one.Yeah?

24:40.651 --> 24:41.756
Did you know?

24:41.859 --> 24:44.724
About what?
Rusty.

24:45.932 --> 24:47.244
I had no idea.

24:47.347 --> 24:50.212
Yeah, I thought
you might.

24:50.316 --> 24:53.181
So, why didn't you tell me?Wasn't my place.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.114
It's never stopped
you before.

24:55.217 --> 24:56.287
This was different.

24:56.391 --> 24:58.358
How?
I don't know.

24:58.462 --> 24:59.739
Okay, so, who
should I ask?

24:59.843 --> 25:00.775
What do you want
from me, Kath?

25:00.878 --> 25:02.397
I want the truth,
Brian.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.020
I gave him my word.

25:05.124 --> 25:07.954
I was worried about him,
and I didn't want to risk it.

25:08.058 --> 25:10.439
Risk what?Betraying his trust.

25:10.543 --> 25:11.786
Are you fucking
kidding me?

25:11.889 --> 25:13.408
We tell each other
everything.

25:16.238 --> 25:18.413
Not this time.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.450
You're seriously gonna walk away
from this conversation?

25:21.554 --> 25:23.038
Looks like it.

25:32.289 --> 25:33.911
Sorry. Yeah?

25:34.015 --> 25:35.085
I'm freaking myself out.

25:35.188 --> 25:37.743
Why?I feel so exposed.

25:37.846 --> 25:39.330
You're in
head to toe fabric.

25:39.434 --> 25:42.023
I have stood on
real snowcapped mountains

25:42.126 --> 25:43.852
with 90% less
coverage than you.

25:43.956 --> 25:46.406
No, not my outfit.
Just...

25:46.510 --> 25:48.408
myself.

25:48.512 --> 25:50.825
I didn't think I'd find
the comments so confronting.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.136
What are you
talking about?

25:52.240 --> 25:53.793
Most of them
are loving you.

25:53.897 --> 25:55.623
And the hardest part is
to get to the first thousand,

25:55.726 --> 25:57.625
and you're almost there.That's not why I did it.

25:57.728 --> 25:59.143
I did it to support Rusty.

26:01.145 --> 26:03.320
I got to go.

26:03.423 --> 26:05.046
Connor's being a baby.

26:08.705 --> 26:10.189
Connor: What am I
even looking at?

26:10.292 --> 26:12.053
Okay, this is
a vision board.

26:12.156 --> 26:14.538
It's really about the emotion,
more than anything.

26:14.642 --> 26:16.782
That doesn't
help me at all.

26:16.885 --> 26:18.335
You've got to be
kidding me. You...

26:18.438 --> 26:20.337
you're not doing that
to my hair.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.029
Nothing is
permanent, babe.

26:23.133 --> 26:26.170
Okay. You know what?
Let me walk you through it all.

26:26.274 --> 26:29.139
Okay.

26:29.242 --> 26:32.694
We have options
for everything.

26:32.798 --> 26:35.835
That is not happening.

26:35.939 --> 26:38.044
No.

26:38.148 --> 26:39.011
This.

26:39.114 --> 26:40.737
That is even worse!

26:40.840 --> 26:42.083
Okay.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.292
Forget these. Thank you.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.225
And consider this...

26:46.328 --> 26:49.918
a very low key
temporary tattoo.

26:50.022 --> 26:52.265
You know what it says?I don't care.

26:52.369 --> 26:53.542
"Connor by Tahlia."

26:53.646 --> 26:55.165
Why don't you just get
a branding iron

26:55.268 --> 26:56.822
and burn it
into my forehead?

26:56.925 --> 27:00.204
Okay, let's
slow it down a bit,

27:00.308 --> 27:02.275
and let's try and pinpoint
the bits that are

27:02.379 --> 27:03.898
really making you
feel uncomfortable.

27:04.001 --> 27:05.416
All of the bits!

27:05.520 --> 27:07.142
I'm not down
with the vision board...

27:07.246 --> 27:09.593
...or the branding.

27:10.939 --> 27:14.391
Babe, is
this about Rusty?

27:14.494 --> 27:15.806
What?

27:15.910 --> 27:17.221
Are you scared
that people are gonna think

27:17.325 --> 27:18.740
you're gay if you wear
those leather pants?

27:18.844 --> 27:20.259
No!'Cause if you are, babe,

27:20.362 --> 27:21.812
I hate to tell you,
but it's pretty homophobic.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.020
I'm not homophobic.
I have gay friends.

27:23.124 --> 27:24.159
And don't say
you have gay friends.

27:24.263 --> 27:27.128
Who?!

27:27.231 --> 27:29.268
Rusty.

27:29.371 --> 27:31.235
Come on, babe.
You can do this.

27:33.341 --> 27:35.550
Look at my face.

27:35.654 --> 27:39.209
If you really don't want to
be here, just say it.

27:39.312 --> 27:42.212
I don't want to be here.

27:42.315 --> 27:43.765
I was bluffing!

27:43.869 --> 27:45.525
Radio Host: Footy fans
have been divided about

27:45.629 --> 27:47.804
Rusty O'Reilly's coming out.

27:47.907 --> 27:50.185
Here to weigh in,
Simone from Seymour.

27:50.289 --> 27:52.153
Woman: Rickards is
playing him this weekend.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.533
Is that
the right call, Simone?

27:53.637 --> 27:54.949
Of course it is!

27:55.052 --> 27:56.709
We finally string
some wins together.

27:56.813 --> 27:58.021
We need him!

27:58.124 --> 27:59.539
Hey, mate, can you turn
that down?

27:59.643 --> 28:00.782
The Jets still
have a few options...

28:00.886 --> 28:01.990
Hey.

28:02.094 --> 28:03.026
You on your way
to the airport?

28:03.129 --> 28:04.475
I am, and I'll be

28:04.579 --> 28:06.339
stepping off the plane
to a sunny 32 degrees.

28:06.443 --> 28:08.479
Is that right?You might miss the rain.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.516
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it rains up north.

28:10.619 --> 28:12.863
Like torrential rain
and floods.

28:12.967 --> 28:14.140
No, don't think so.

28:14.244 --> 28:15.728
Yeah, they have
an official wet season.

28:15.832 --> 28:17.074
I haven't heard that.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.940
Okay, so, is this part
of your sales pitch?

28:21.044 --> 28:22.528
Hell no.

28:22.631 --> 28:24.564
I'm gonna be honing that
night and day till I get back.

28:24.668 --> 28:27.257
There'll be a Power Point
presentation with soundtrack,

28:27.360 --> 28:30.329
possibly some backup dancers,
chocolate snacks.

28:32.124 --> 28:34.091
Right, you're really pulling
out the big guns then?

28:34.195 --> 28:37.543
Well, it's the biggest pitch
of my life, so yeah.

28:46.034 --> 28:47.933
Alright,
so what are we up to?

28:48.036 --> 28:49.693
Followers, numbers,
how many?

28:49.797 --> 28:51.488
I don't know.
I haven't checked since

28:51.591 --> 28:52.661
I was on the phone
with you.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.491
What?!Where are we at?

28:54.594 --> 28:56.493
Paige went a little bit
viral this afternoon.

28:56.596 --> 28:57.701
-Did you?
-What'd you do?

28:57.805 --> 28:59.013
Nothing.No, no, no, not nothing.

28:59.116 --> 29:00.531
She put up a photo
about Rusty,

29:00.635 --> 29:02.361
and she's completely
exploded.

29:02.464 --> 29:05.157
Oh.She's up to 8,000 followers.

29:05.260 --> 29:07.953
-What was the hash tag?
-Just "I stand with Rusty."

29:08.056 --> 29:10.818
Oh, that is what we should
all be doing.

29:10.921 --> 29:12.060
-Yes.
-To Rusty!

29:12.164 --> 29:14.028
-To Rusty.
-Yeah, to Rusty.

29:14.131 --> 29:15.788
-Mmm.
-I just don't understand

29:15.892 --> 29:17.134
why he did it now.

29:17.238 --> 29:19.654
Yeah, and why not sooner?Or later?

29:19.758 --> 29:22.105
He did it for me.

29:23.347 --> 29:26.143
Because I'm pregnant.

29:26.247 --> 29:27.524
-What?!

29:27.627 --> 29:29.595
Ladies...

29:29.698 --> 29:32.322
-Hi, Trav.
-Ah, I didn't hear anything,

29:32.425 --> 29:33.806
in case you're wondering.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.325
Ah, 'cause of the surround sound
in the cinema.

29:35.428 --> 29:37.430
I'm pregnant.

29:37.534 --> 29:39.156
What?!You told him!

29:39.260 --> 29:42.539
I fell over yesterday.Come here.

29:42.642 --> 29:45.128
Congratulations, baby.

29:45.231 --> 29:47.061
Your face
isn't even fat.

29:47.164 --> 29:48.269
-That'll come.
-No, no, no.

29:48.372 --> 29:50.133
It was fat
straight away with JJ.

29:50.236 --> 29:53.136
-How do you feel?
-Terrified...

29:53.239 --> 29:55.103
hungry, tired.

29:55.207 --> 29:56.691
Course you are.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.968
Now, you're not alone.

29:58.072 --> 30:00.799
I know Jack's not here,
but we are.

30:00.902 --> 30:03.318
Hey. I just remembered,
bought two of these.

30:03.422 --> 30:04.768
And the kids and I,
we're into the other one, so...

30:04.872 --> 30:07.426
Yep. Trav's already nominated
himself godfather.

30:07.529 --> 30:09.808
-Ah.
-There are no other nominations.

30:09.911 --> 30:11.188
That's my gig, and I'm gonna
take it seriously.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.156
I'm not gonna give
that one sugar.

30:13.259 --> 30:14.743
-He will.
-I know.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.469
Brian: It's a huge game
for us, boys.

30:16.573 --> 30:19.196
'Cause here is where
we can own this mob.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.474
Alright, quick hands,
out of the packs.

30:21.578 --> 30:23.442
Use your speed, use your skill.

30:23.545 --> 30:26.894
I want 22 blokes turning up
tomorrow ready to play.

30:26.997 --> 30:29.344
-You got it?
-Hands, hands, hands!

30:29.448 --> 30:30.552
Yep!

30:42.426 --> 30:44.428
You're late.

30:44.532 --> 30:46.051
Let's go, boys!

30:46.154 --> 30:48.053
Come on, boys!

30:51.746 --> 30:53.368
Andrew: Hey.

30:57.096 --> 30:58.649
-See you tomorrow, son.
-Good night.

31:12.663 --> 31:16.357
You're still part
of this team.

31:16.460 --> 31:19.187
And you should've had
the balls to stand

31:19.291 --> 31:21.603
shoulder to shoulder
with your coach and captain

31:21.707 --> 31:24.192
when they were forced to make
a statement to defend you.

31:24.296 --> 31:27.368
Yeah, I didn't ask anyone
to defend me.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.269
Yes, you did.

31:32.373 --> 31:34.754
When you dropped
your little bomb,

31:34.858 --> 31:37.585
fell off the face
of the earth.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.725
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

31:39.828 --> 31:42.141
Hm?

31:42.245 --> 31:44.281
You made the choice,

31:44.385 --> 31:46.456
and you should've
been there to defend it.

31:48.837 --> 31:51.357
I'll explain myself
on the field.

31:53.670 --> 31:56.742
If it was up to me...

31:56.845 --> 31:58.882
you'd be out
on your arse, son.

31:58.986 --> 32:00.401
Brian: Let's just see
how you pull up tomorrow.

32:00.504 --> 32:02.437
Player:
Alright, thank you.

32:02.541 --> 32:05.371
The only reason
you're playing this week...

32:05.475 --> 32:08.685
is because of this man's
faith in you.

32:08.788 --> 32:11.930
He stuck his neck
out for you.

32:12.033 --> 32:14.070
Don't mistake this
for forgiveness.

32:14.173 --> 32:15.485
Still got a lot of ground
to make up.

32:15.588 --> 32:18.626
There will be consequences,
but not this week.

32:20.662 --> 32:22.285
Yep.

32:24.321 --> 32:27.359
Can't punish the gay boy
for coming out this week, right?

32:42.270 --> 32:44.652
-Go behind him. Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:46.861 --> 32:49.070
Mate, you know how much
I want to be there

32:49.174 --> 32:50.416
for you and JJ.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.971
Yeah, of course I do.No, just let me...

32:55.421 --> 32:57.182
I just want to say,
officially,

32:57.285 --> 32:59.978
that I will do
everything I can

33:00.081 --> 33:03.636
to make sure this kid
knows who he was.

33:09.504 --> 33:13.301
You're
a good mate, Trav.

33:21.827 --> 33:25.555
I gave Jack Xanax...

33:25.658 --> 33:27.557
and oxycodone.

33:29.352 --> 33:31.285
You know,
it was a while ago.

33:31.388 --> 33:34.219
I know.

33:34.322 --> 33:36.255
He told me.

33:39.120 --> 33:42.158
Course he did.

33:43.711 --> 33:47.025
I just wanted
to help him.

33:47.128 --> 33:48.681
I know you did.

33:48.785 --> 33:51.546
Okay?

33:51.650 --> 33:55.205
He had dabbled before.

33:55.309 --> 33:57.414
It got a lot worse after
the Grand Final,

33:57.518 --> 34:01.694
but you were not the first one
to give him those pills.

34:21.956 --> 34:23.682
I wanted your face.

34:23.785 --> 34:26.478
I know that sounds weird,
but it's true.

34:26.581 --> 34:29.619
I mean,
it's "Connor by Tahlia."

34:29.722 --> 34:33.105
I didn't even consider
anyone else's face for it.

34:33.209 --> 34:35.003
But I really underestimated
how uncomfortable

34:35.107 --> 34:38.593
it would make you,
and I'm sorry.

34:40.561 --> 34:42.287
Thank you.

34:42.390 --> 34:44.841
But I did tell
you specifically,

34:44.944 --> 34:47.602
a number of times.Don't ruin it, there's more.

34:47.706 --> 34:50.398
I called the agency,
and I sold them on

34:50.502 --> 34:55.023
a brooding, abstract
silhouette instead,

34:55.127 --> 34:56.439
and you're off the hook.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.544
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

34:58.648 --> 34:59.890
I can't make you
do anything that makes you

34:59.994 --> 35:02.169
that uncomfortable...

35:02.272 --> 35:04.343
in public.

35:08.244 --> 35:10.522
Three little words...

35:10.625 --> 35:12.420
dress-up drawer.

35:12.524 --> 35:14.112
You don't have to
answer now.

35:19.738 --> 35:22.223
You still haven't
liked my post.

35:22.327 --> 35:24.708
Yeah, that's 'cause
I don't like it.

35:24.812 --> 35:26.883
Well, a lot of
other people do.

35:26.986 --> 35:29.023
Yeah, well,
congratulations, Paige.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.956
Are you shitty with me?

35:31.059 --> 35:33.303
Not really.
What about?

35:33.407 --> 35:34.822
I don't know.
What?

35:34.925 --> 35:37.135
Well, since when do you
give a shit about social media?

35:37.238 --> 35:38.895
Since -- since I realized
it could be used

35:38.998 --> 35:40.586
for actual good
and not just evil.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.140
Oh.

35:42.243 --> 35:43.520
Yeah, I freaked out
about it, too.

35:43.624 --> 35:45.453
I still -- I still
feel kind of weird.

35:45.557 --> 35:48.456
It's just -- it's so --
it's not you.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.424
How do you know what's me
when I don't even know?

35:50.527 --> 35:52.046
You asked what I thought.Go ahead.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.221
Well, I'm not into you
hijacking my teammate's

35:54.324 --> 35:56.430
personal shit so that
you can get strangers

35:56.533 --> 35:57.810
to follow you online.

35:57.914 --> 35:58.915
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

35:59.018 --> 36:00.882
I don't know
what you're doing.

36:00.986 --> 36:02.332
Oh, my God.
What?

36:02.436 --> 36:04.023
You're
embarrassed by me.

36:04.127 --> 36:05.508
Oh, for
fuck's sake, Paige.

36:05.611 --> 36:07.268
I've got a massive game
tomorrow, alright?

36:07.372 --> 36:08.890
Just...

36:08.994 --> 36:10.478
I've got to
get some sleep.

36:10.582 --> 36:12.791
Wait,
was that a fight?

36:12.894 --> 36:15.034
II can't go to sleep
if that was a fight.

36:15.138 --> 36:16.795
Talk about it
in the morning.

36:21.524 --> 36:24.354
Rusty did come out to me.

36:24.458 --> 36:27.219
Last year.

36:27.323 --> 36:31.119
He wanted to
tell everyone himself.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.330
He didn't
go through with it.

36:34.433 --> 36:37.747
Did he say why?

36:37.850 --> 36:40.094
Wasn't my place
to push him.

36:43.649 --> 36:47.135
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

36:49.724 --> 36:52.175
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

36:52.279 --> 36:54.764
Not off the top
of my head, no.

36:54.867 --> 36:57.353
Anything you
haven't told me?

36:57.456 --> 37:00.494
No.

37:00.597 --> 37:03.082
I appreciate
the apology.

37:04.429 --> 37:07.811
You sorted out
that post-Adam situation?

37:07.915 --> 37:09.123
Yeah.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.747
I believe I have.

37:12.851 --> 37:15.094
Anyway.

37:29.074 --> 37:30.351
Oh, thank God!

37:30.455 --> 37:33.423
Joanna, Joanna, Joanna!

37:33.527 --> 37:36.288
Oh, we've missed
you so much!

37:37.807 --> 37:38.911
I've missed you more
than the others.

37:39.015 --> 37:40.050
Come inside.

37:40.154 --> 37:42.536
Tell me,
how was your trip?

37:42.639 --> 37:43.640
Did you have fun?

37:43.744 --> 37:45.711
I'm not staying.

37:45.815 --> 37:47.368
What?
I met someone.

37:47.472 --> 37:48.507
Who?
A man.

37:48.611 --> 37:49.750
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:49.853 --> 37:51.924
What's, uh,
what's going on here?

37:52.028 --> 37:53.132
Joanna met a man.

37:53.236 --> 37:55.549
I have fallen
very deeply in love.

37:55.652 --> 37:56.757
Wait, you've
only just met.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.034
You've only been
gone 48 hours.

37:58.137 --> 38:00.174
The attraction
was instantaneous.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.108
Love at first
sight, huh?

38:03.211 --> 38:05.386
Maybe sometimes with
these big life decisions,

38:05.490 --> 38:07.388
it's better to take things
a little more slowly.

38:07.492 --> 38:10.288
I'm just here
to collect my things.

38:10.391 --> 38:11.599
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:11.703 --> 38:12.807
Don't you have to give us
notice first?

38:12.911 --> 38:14.153
No!
No.

38:14.257 --> 38:15.431
No, she's got it written
into her contracts

38:15.534 --> 38:17.467
that she can
leave at any time.

38:17.571 --> 38:19.883
Is this a money thing?It's not a money thing.

38:19.987 --> 38:21.782
Do you want a snack?

38:21.885 --> 38:23.749
Is there anything
that I can say

38:23.853 --> 38:26.234
or do that will help
you change your mind?

38:26.338 --> 38:27.788
Anything at all?No.

38:27.891 --> 38:31.481
Please do not make a scene
in front of the children.

38:34.381 --> 38:37.349
When is
she coming back?

38:37.453 --> 38:39.972
She's not, mate.

38:40.076 --> 38:41.698
Come on.

38:49.775 --> 38:52.053
Dan, you're gonna be late!

39:27.986 --> 39:29.332
Good luck.

39:29.436 --> 39:31.783
Thanks, babe.I'll see you there.
