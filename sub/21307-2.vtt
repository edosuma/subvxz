GLENN VILLENEUVE: IT'S FALL
TIME HERE IN THE BROOKS RANGE.

00:10.027 --> 00:12.528
THE FIRST SNOW IS
ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.530
AND IT'S AN
EXCITING TIME OF THE YEAR.

00:14.632 --> 00:16.198
WINTER'S JUST
AROUND THE CORNER.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.900
AND THIS TIME OF YEAR
IS WHEN I GO OUT AND START

00:18.002 --> 00:19.234
LOOKING FOR A MOOSE.

00:19.336 --> 00:21.036
IT'S MY FIRST
DAY MOOSE HUNTING.

00:21.138 --> 00:23.505
I'M LOOKING AROUND,
SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.641
MOOSE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

00:49.467 --> 00:50.532
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
WHEN I GET A MOOSE,

00:50.668 --> 00:53.135
THAT MOOSE SEES ME THROUGH
A GOOD PART OF THE WINTER.

00:53.237 --> 00:55.671
THERE'S A LOT OF MEAT
ON A BIG BULL MOOSE.

00:55.773 --> 00:57.573
IT'S AN IMPORTANT HUNT.

00:57.675 --> 01:01.009
MOST YEARS, I'LL WALK 25
TO 50 MILES TO GET A MOOSE.

01:02.079 --> 01:03.879
IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE
ARE NOT THAT MANY MOOSE.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.382
AND THE MOOSE AROUND ARE SPREAD
OUT OVER A LOT OF TERRITORY.

01:12.389 --> 01:13.288
LOOK AT THIS.

01:13.390 --> 01:15.791
THAT'S A FRESH MOOSE SCAT.

01:15.893 --> 01:17.159
MOOSE WALKED RIGHT
DOWN THROUGH HERE,

01:17.261 --> 01:18.627
DEFECATED RIGHT HERE.

01:18.729 --> 01:20.262
THIS ISN'T VERY OLD.

01:20.364 --> 01:22.431
LISTEN TO THAT.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.101
AND I JUST HEARD A BULL MOOSE
GRUNT RIGHT OVER THIS WAY.

01:26.203 --> 01:27.703
I GOTTA TRY AND
GET THIS MOOSE.

01:55.599 --> 01:56.598
I JUST HEARD A BULL MOOSE.

01:56.734 --> 01:59.768
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THIS FALL THAT I'VE HEARD A

01:59.870 --> 02:03.138
BULL MOOSE GRUNT.

02:04.475 --> 02:06.275
HE'S OVER THAT WAY.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.343
A LOT OF TIMES, I'LL
LOCATE MOOSE BY MY EARS,

02:08.445 --> 02:10.145
LONG BEFORE I CAN SEE HIM.

02:10.247 --> 02:12.514
THAT MOOSE, HE'S
PROBABLY A MILE AWAY,

02:12.616 --> 02:13.782
BUT I CAN HEAR HIM.

02:13.884 --> 02:15.584
AND IF I HEAD OVER THERE,
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE HE'LL

02:15.686 --> 02:17.920
STILL BE IN THE AREA.

02:19.490 --> 02:21.657
IN ORDER TO INTERCEPT THE FEW
ANIMALS THAT LIVE OUT HERE,

02:21.759 --> 02:23.959
I HAVE TO COVER A
LOT OF TERRITORY.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.829
IT'S A HARSH COUNTRY AND
THE ANIMALS ARE SPREAD OUT

02:26.931 --> 02:29.064
OVER A LOT OF TERRAIN.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.970
THERE'S THE BULL.

02:35.206 --> 02:38.607
THAT'S A BIG BULL
MOOSE RIGHT THERE.

02:38.976 --> 02:40.976
YOU SEE, HE'S SNIFFING THE
REAR END OF THAT COW RIGHT NOW,

02:41.078 --> 02:42.311
CHECKING HER OUT.

02:42.413 --> 02:43.912
YOU SEE HOW HE'S
CURLING HIS LIP?

02:44.014 --> 02:46.515
HOLDING HIS HEAD UP,
HE JUST SNIFFED HER.

02:46.617 --> 02:49.351
WE GET LUCKY, WE MIGHT SEE HIM
JUMP RIGHT UP ON TOP OF HER.

02:57.027 --> 03:00.629
HUNTING MOOSE, IT'S ALL
ABOUT SEX AND DECEPTION.

03:02.700 --> 03:07.035
HE WANTS TO BE THE ONE
TO MATE WITH THE COWS.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.671
I'VE GOTTA ACT LIKE
ANOTHER BULL MOOSE,

03:09.773 --> 03:13.775
BECAUSE THAT BULL
DOESN'T WANT ME AROUND.

03:21.218 --> 03:23.518
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
BULL IS GONNA LEAVE THAT

03:23.621 --> 03:26.488
COW RIGHT NOW.

03:29.827 --> 03:30.993
IT'S STARTING TO RAIN.

03:31.095 --> 03:32.861
AND IF I WERE TO
KILL A MOOSE REAL LATE,

03:32.963 --> 03:34.229
AND IT STARTED
RAINING A LOT TONIGHT,

03:34.331 --> 03:35.230
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

03:35.332 --> 03:36.498
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE MEAT.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.100
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
AFTER YOU GET A MOOSE IS TO

03:38.202 --> 03:39.334
KEEP THE MEAT DRY.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.136
SO, RATHER THAN STAY
UP REALLY LATE TONIGHT,

03:41.238 --> 03:42.271
I'M GONNA CALL IT A NIGHT NOW.

03:42.373 --> 03:44.239
TOMORROW, I CAN GET UP
AND GO OUT REAL EARLY,

03:44.341 --> 03:45.240
HAVE A LOOK AROUND.

03:45.342 --> 03:48.210
MAYBE THE WEATHER
WILL BE BETTER.

03:52.182 --> 03:53.749
AGNES HAILSTONE:
THERE'S LOTS TO SEE,

03:53.851 --> 03:55.918
THE COUNTRY IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.387
IT'S STILL A FUN RIDE.

04:05.963 --> 04:08.797
IT'S A REAL NICE DAY TO GO
FISHING AT CAMP, ALL RIGHT.

04:09.066 --> 04:11.166
KIND OF WINDY, NOT TOO BAD.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.535
SO, TODAY, I'M
GOING OUT ON THE BOAT,

04:13.637 --> 04:15.437
AND WE'RE HEADING
TO KOOKOOCHIAQ.

04:15.539 --> 04:17.339
I'M TAKING TINMIAQ

04:17.441 --> 04:19.207
WE'RE GONNA BE
SETTING A SALMON NET.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.444
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE LAST
SALMON FISHING FOR THE SEASON.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.881

AN ADVENTURE IF WE BREAK DOWN,

04:25.983 --> 04:28.917

BECAUSE IT'S A BIG
PROCESS TO TAKE IT APART AND

10:29.346 --> 10:31.079
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.

10:31.181 --> 10:33.348
IT'S CALLED A
PORTABLE SAWMILL,

10:33.450 --> 10:35.750
BUT IT'S NOT THAT PORTABLE.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.386
IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU CAN
DO WITH A SIMPLE TOOL LIKE

10:38.488 --> 10:41.723
A LOG, I GUESS.

10:48.298 --> 10:51.132
I'M GLAD I DIDN'T DECIDE TO
USE THE DOGS FOR THIS BECAUSE

10:51.234 --> 10:53.068
THEY'D HAVE WENT A LITTLE TOO
FAST FOR ME AND THEY MIGHT'VE

10:53.170 --> 10:55.503
WRECKED THIS THING.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.908
THIS SAWMILL MAKES ME
INDEPENDENT OF TOWN.

11:00.010 --> 11:01.509
I DON'T NEED THE
LUMBER FROM TOWN.

11:01.611 --> 11:03.545
LUMBER IS EXPENSIVE
UP HERE IN ALASKA.

11:03.647 --> 11:05.880
I HAVE ALL THIS RAW
RESOURCE AROUND ME THAT I CAN

11:05.982 --> 11:07.415
TURN INTO LUMBER.

11:07.517 --> 11:08.917
NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I
CAN BUILD MYSELF A NICE

11:09.019 --> 11:10.652
TWO-STORY CABIN.

11:11.788 --> 11:14.656
I CAN MOVE RIGHT ON
INTO MY NEXT PROCESS,

11:14.758 --> 11:16.791
OF SETTING UP
THIS RAIL SYSTEM.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.394
I'VE NEVER PUT TOGETHER
A SAWMILL OR USED ONE.

11:19.496 --> 11:20.862
I'VE SEEN 'EM IN
THE OPERATION,

11:20.964 --> 11:22.831
BUT I'VE BEEN IN
THE WOODS LOGGING,

11:22.933 --> 11:24.099
BUILDING HOUSES.

11:24.234 --> 11:26.668
I PRETTY MUCH BUILT MY LIFE
AROUND BEING ABLE TO USE WOOD,

11:26.903 --> 11:29.738
SO IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP.

11:30.574 --> 11:33.174
NOW, I'M GETTING THIS
CLOSER TO WHERE IT'S GONNA BE.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.244
I NEED TO LEVEL UP SOME
PLATFORMS FOR IT TO GO ONTO.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.613
THEN, THERE'S GONNA
BE A LOT OF TWEAKING,

11:38.715 --> 11:40.815
AND LEVELING, AND SQUARING TO
MAKE SURE THIS THING GOES ALL

11:40.917 --> 11:43.551
TOGETHER, OTHERWISE, THIS MILL
WILL NOT RUN SMOOTHLY ON THIS.

11:44.254 --> 11:47.122
ONE STEP DOWN, ABOUT FIFTEEN
MORE TO GO BEFORE THIS THING'S

11:47.224 --> 11:50.291
GONNA BE CUTTING UP SOME WOOD.

11:54.564 --> 11:58.266

TAKE TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE?

22:54.390 --> 22:56.256
BUT I'M NOT
ACHIEVING THE GOAL.

22:56.358 --> 22:59.193
THE GOAL WAS TO TRY AND
CATCH A FISH AND AT THAT,

22:59.295 --> 23:01.395
I FAILED MISERABLY.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.497
YOU KNOW, IT'S PART OF WHY
I DON'T LIKE TO SET GOALS.

23:03.599 --> 23:06.266
I MEAN, I WANNA GO
FISHING, BUT I WANNA EXPLORE.

23:06.368 --> 23:08.135
YOU KNOW, LIKE I TELL
PEOPLE, I'M NOT LOST,

23:08.237 --> 23:10.304
I'M JUST EXPLORING.

23:16.946 --> 23:19.079
JESSIE HOLMES: THIS IS NOT A
PERFECTLY CLEAN LIFESTYLE,

23:19.181 --> 23:21.148
DEALING WITH FISH,
MOTORS, WOOD.

23:21.250 --> 23:23.350
I MEAN, THERE AIN'T NO WAY TO
GET THESE JOBS DONE WITHOUT

23:23.452 --> 23:25.452
GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY.

23:35.764 --> 23:38.632
I GOT THIS FRAME SYSTEM
SET UP FOR THE SAWMILL.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.135
AND NOW WHAT I GOTTA DO
IS GET A PERMANENT LEVEL

23:41.237 --> 23:43.570
FRAMING FOR IT TO SIT ON.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.509
<i>NARRATOR: IN NENANA, JESSIE</i>
<i>IS SETTING UP HIS NEW SAWMILL,</i>

23:48.611 --> 23:51.278
<i>A VITAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT</i>
<i>THAT WILL MAXIMIZE HIS ABILITY</i>

23:51.380 --> 23:54.648
<i>TO USE THE NATURAL</i>
<i>RESOURCES IN THE AREA.</i>

23:55.317 --> 23:58.118
<i>BUT MOVING HEAVY MACHINERY</i>
<i>WITHOUT HELPING CAMP IS A</i>

23:58.220 --> 24:01.321
<i>GRUELING TASK AND HE MUST</i>
<i>BE CAREFUL TO AVOID DAMAGING</i>

24:01.423 --> 24:03.891
<i>THE EQUIPMENT OR HIMSELF.</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:07.461
JESSIE HOLMES: THIS IS
SOME UNLEVEL GROUND,

24:07.563 --> 24:10.364
SO IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME
GROUNDWORK AND SOME GROUND PREP.

24:10.466 --> 24:12.533
I'M GONNA TAKE THESE TIMBERS
HERE THAT I'VE SALVAGED FROM

24:12.635 --> 24:15.235
OTHER PROJECTS AND
MAKE USE OF WHAT I ALREADY

24:15.337 --> 24:17.037
HAVE AROUND HERE.

24:17.139 --> 24:20.974
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS GONNA
SIT ON FOR ITS SOLID FOUNDATION.

24:21.277 --> 24:23.810
I'M TRYING TO EYEBALL
THE GROUND FOR NOW.

24:23.913 --> 24:26.346
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
MY FIRST ONE'S GONNA START,

24:26.448 --> 24:29.550
LEVEL IT UP, AND THEN LEVEL
THE REST OF THEM TO THAT.

24:30.853 --> 24:32.986
THE REASON I'M GONNA USE
THESE HEAVY-DUTY TIMBERS IS

24:33.088 --> 24:35.155
BECAUSE THIS IS A HEAVY-DUTY
NAIL AND I WANT IT SET UP ON

24:35.257 --> 24:38.559
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GONNA
SHAKE, SHIMMY.

24:40.496 --> 24:42.462
GOT THESE LEVELED UP,
SQUARED UP.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.198
NOW ALL I GOTTA
DO IS MEASURE OUT,

24:44.300 --> 24:47.367
SPACE MY TIMBERS, LEVEL UP
MY GROUND ALL TO THIS TIMBER,

24:47.469 --> 24:50.304
AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO
PUT MY SYSTEM ON THERE.

24:53.075 --> 24:56.310
ALL RIGHT, I GOT ALL
MY TIMBERS LEVELED UP,

24:56.412 --> 24:59.079
IT'S READY TO PUT THIS RAIL
ASSEMBLY UP HERE AND START

24:59.181 --> 25:01.582
DIALING HER ALL IN.

25:04.353 --> 25:05.886
ALL RIGHT, THAT
WASN'T TOO BAD.

25:05.988 --> 25:07.354
NOW THIS THING'S
STARTING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S

25:07.456 --> 25:09.823
COMING MORE TOGETHER.

25:15.264 --> 25:16.363
ON THE MONEY.

25:16.465 --> 25:17.998
MY RAIL SYSTEM IS LEVEL.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.634
NEXT THING I GOTTA DO
IS GET MY MAST UP HERE.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.937
THE MAST IS THE
ACTUAL SAW PART.

25:24.039 --> 25:25.339
THE BLACK RUNNER IS HERE.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.174
NEED TO SIT ON THIS TRACK SO
IT CAN SLIDE DOWN THE LENGTH

25:27.276 --> 25:30.344
OF IT CUTTING THE TIMBER.

25:36.085 --> 25:38.452
SHOVE THIS THING ON HERE.

25:38.554 --> 25:40.287
ALL RIGHT.

25:40.389 --> 25:41.955
SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA
USE YOUR BACK AND IT'S A

25:42.057 --> 25:43.523
REWARDING FEELING, YOU KNOW?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.158
WHEN YOU CAN DO THINGS
YOURSELF AND YOU DON'T GOTTA

25:45.261 --> 25:48.428
CALL IN EVERYBODY TO HELP YOU.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.834
I TRY TO JUST GET IN THAT MIND
FRAME ALL THE TIME ANYWAYS.

25:53.936 --> 25:55.535
MAYBE I CAN CALL
SOMEBODY TO COME HELP ME,

25:55.638 --> 25:57.571
BUT MORE REWARDING
TO DO IT MYSELF.

25:57.673 --> 26:00.707
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

26:00.943 --> 26:03.176
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD, BUT...

26:10.753 --> 26:13.120
OKAY, I'M ON THE RAIL.

26:21.096 --> 26:23.764
(BLEEP) YEAH, SWEET.

26:24.633 --> 26:27.234
GOT MY FOUNDATION ALL
SQUARED UP AND LEVELED UP AND

26:27.336 --> 26:29.903
MY RAIL SYSTEM ON TO PUT
TOGETHER.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.039
NOW I GOT MY
POWER HEAD ON HERE,

26:32.141 --> 26:34.207
WHICH WAS HEAVY, AND A
LITTLE BIT OF A HARD DEAL,

26:34.310 --> 26:36.810
AND IT'S ON HERE NOW,
AND IT'S SLIDING GOOD.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.913
THIS IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.049
SMOOTH SLIDING, LEVEL.

26:42.151 --> 26:44.918
I'LL BE MAKING UP
SOME LUMBER HERE SOON.

26:45.754 --> 26:47.954
FOR ME, IT'S NOT ABOUT
ROUGHING IT ANY MORE.

26:48.057 --> 26:49.456
I'M TRYING TO LEARN
HOW TO SMOOTH IT.

26:49.558 --> 26:52.492
I'M TRYING TO BETTER MY
LIFE EVERY YEAR AS I GO ALONG

26:52.594 --> 26:55.362
SO I CAN GIVE MORE TO MY
DOGS AND MORE TO MYSELF.

26:55.564 --> 26:57.030
IT'S HARD ENVIRONMENT UP HERE.

26:57.132 --> 26:58.799
THE WEATHER'S
ALWAYS WEARING ON YOU.

26:58.901 --> 26:59.966
I DON'T WANNA ROUGH IT.

27:00.069 --> 27:01.335
I'M 30 NOW, YOU KNOW?

27:01.437 --> 27:03.270
I GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT
TAKING CARE OF MY BODY AND

27:03.372 --> 27:06.239
LIVING A LITTLE NICER, SO
THIS IS A BIG STEP FOR ME,

27:06.342 --> 27:08.542
THIS IS GREAT.

27:15.651 --> 27:17.718
AGNES HAILSTONE: I LIVE A
SUBSISTENCE LIFESTYLE AND

27:17.820 --> 27:19.653
THAT'S THE WAY I'M
RAISING MY GIRLS,

27:19.755 --> 27:22.923
AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL RAISE
THEIR CHILDREN THIS WAY TOO.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.495
NICE DAY FOR BOATING.

27:28.597 --> 27:30.364
HOPEFULLY GET A LOT OF SALMON.

27:30.466 --> 27:32.733
I DON'T KNOW HOW THE
SALMON RUN IS LATELY.

27:32.835 --> 27:35.535
YESTERDAY, ME, TINMIAQ,
AND QUTAN IRENE WENT TO

27:35.637 --> 27:38.638
KOOKOOCHIAQ CAMP
AND SET A SALMON NET.

27:40.042 --> 27:42.776
SO, TODAY WE'RE GONNA GO
CHECK IT AND SEE HOW IT'S,

27:42.878 --> 27:46.313
HOW MUCH FISH ARE, HOPEFULLY
THERE'S SALMON FISH IN IT AND

27:46.415 --> 27:49.616
IT'S JUST GONNA BE A OVERNIGHT
TRIP AND IT'S GONNA BE PRETTY

27:49.718 --> 27:53.220
MUCH OUR LAST FISHING, SALMON
FISHING AT KOOKOOCHIAQ CAMP.

27:54.456 --> 27:58.291
GONNA BE A FUN,
COLD BOAT RIDE, HUH?

27:58.394 --> 28:00.494
TING HAILSTONE: HOPEFULLY
THERE'S LOTS OF FISH IN THE NET.

28:00.596 --> 28:05.198
AGNES HAILSTONE:
YEAH, CHILLY HUH?

28:06.135 --> 28:08.268
TING HAILSTONE: YEAH, WAY
COLDER THAN YESTERDAY, HUH?

28:08.370 --> 28:09.703
AGNES HAILSTONE: YEP.

28:09.805 --> 28:13.073
PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME I
GO ON THESE LONG TRIPS,

28:13.175 --> 28:15.342
I USUALLY LEAVE
THE FRONT FOR QUTAN.

28:15.444 --> 28:17.277
IT'S NICE, WARM,
AND DRY UP FRONT,

28:17.379 --> 28:20.614
SO THAT'S WHERE SHE USUALLY
STAYS AND IT'S EASIER FOR HER

28:20.716 --> 28:23.116
TO GET IN AND OUT OF
THE BOAT THAT WAY.

28:25.754 --> 28:27.788
WELL, NET'S STILL HERE.

28:27.890 --> 28:29.756
TING HAILSTONE: YEAH, BUT
SOME OF THE FLOATS ARE DOWN,

28:29.858 --> 28:31.057
SO THERE MUST BE FISH, HUH?

28:31.160 --> 28:32.726
AGNES HAILSTONE: HOPEFULLY.

28:32.828 --> 28:34.461
<i>[GASP]</i>

28:40.803 --> 28:42.503
AGNES HAILSTONE:
WELL, NET'S STILL HERE.

28:42.605 --> 28:44.671
TING HAILSTONE: YEAH, BUT
SOME OF THE FLOATS ARE DOWN,

28:44.774 --> 28:46.540
SO THERE MUST BE FISH, HUH?

28:46.642 --> 28:49.176
AGNES HAILSTONE: HOPEFULLY.

28:49.445 --> 28:50.544
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
OH LOOK, FISH!

28:50.646 --> 28:52.012
AGNES HAILSTONE: THERE'S FISH?

28:52.114 --> 28:53.380
TING HAILSTONE:
YEAH, THERE'S FISH.

28:53.482 --> 28:54.581
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
LOOK, THERE'S ONE TINY,

28:54.683 --> 28:55.749
WHAT IS IT CALLED?

28:55.851 --> 28:56.984
TING HAILSTONE:
SMALL LITTLE PIKE.

28:57.086 --> 28:58.118
LOOK, RIGHT THERE,
IT'S A WHITEFISH,

28:58.220 --> 28:59.319
COULD SEE IT LOOK LIKE.

28:59.421 --> 29:00.454
AGNES HAILSTONE: RIGHT ON.

29:00.556 --> 29:02.256
OH LOOK,
THERE'S A WHITEFISH, YAY.

29:02.358 --> 29:03.924
TING HAILSTONE: OH YAY, I
CAN SEE ANOTHER ONE COMING UP

29:04.026 --> 29:08.428
RIGHT HERE.

29:08.531 --> 29:10.030
QUTAN HAILSTONE: HEY,
COULD I GET THE SMALL ONE?

29:10.132 --> 29:11.398
TING HAILSTONE: YEAH,
YOU CAN GET THE SMALL ONE.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.666
TAKE YOUR GLOVES OFF, THOUGH.

29:12.768 --> 29:16.069
AGNES HAILSTONE:
GRAB IT, BABY.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.838
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
AH, IT'S SO SLIPPERY!

29:17.940 --> 29:19.706
TING HAILSTONE: IT'S
NOT GONNA BITE YOU.

29:19.809 --> 29:21.175
AGNES HAILSTONE:
THAT IS A PIKE.

29:21.277 --> 29:23.577
THEY HAVE SHARP TEETH.

29:23.779 --> 29:27.114
SALMON, A SPAWNED OUT SALMON.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.150
OH, THEY'RE WHITEFISH!

29:30.252 --> 29:31.251
TING HAILSTONE:
WOW, WHITEFISH!

29:31.353 --> 29:32.619
QUTAN HAILSTONE: WHITEFISH?

29:32.721 --> 29:33.620
YES.

29:33.722 --> 29:35.122
TING HAILSTONE: ALIVE!

29:35.224 --> 29:36.590
QUTAN HAILSTONE:
CAN I HAVE SOME,

29:36.692 --> 29:37.991
CAN I HAVE STOMACHS, MOM?

29:38.093 --> 29:39.226
AGNES HAILSTONE: YEP.

29:39.328 --> 29:40.961
TING HAILSTONE: YES,
WE'LL GIVE YOU THE STOMACHS.

29:41.063 --> 29:42.563
AGNES HAILSTONE: WHITEFISH,
FRESH WHITEFISH, PERFECT.

29:42.665 --> 29:44.431
THAT'S, THAT'S
WHAT'S FOR DINNER.

29:44.533 --> 29:48.001
GO TAKE CARE OF THESE
FISH, AND COOK SOME UP,

29:48.103 --> 29:50.437
AND SPEND THE NIGHT
HERE AT KOOKOOCHIAQ CAMP.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.638
LOOK, WE MISSED ONE.

29:51.740 --> 29:52.840
IT'S ANOTHER FISH.

29:52.942 --> 29:53.874
TING HAILSTONE: WOW!

29:53.976 --> 29:55.209
AGNES HAILSTONE: YAY.

29:55.311 --> 29:56.743
TING HAILSTONE: NOW
THAT THE NET IS PULLED,

29:56.846 --> 29:57.911
WE CAN GO WARM UP
AND MUNCH, HUH?

WE'RE HAVING FISH FOR DINNER.

GLENN VILLENEUVE: THERE ARE
PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO WORRY

30:05.955 --> 30:07.521
ABOUT THEIR FOOD.

30:07.623 --> 30:10.757
I DON'T BECAUSE I KNOW
HOW TO GET IT IF I NEED IT.

30:21.503 --> 30:24.872
MY GOAL FOR TONIGHT IS TO
GET THIS MOOSE ALL CUT UP INTO

30:24.974 --> 30:27.541
PIECES THAT I CAN MOVE.

30:27.977 --> 30:30.577
<i>NARRATOR: GLENN HAS</i>
<i>SUCCESSFULLY HARVESTED A MOOSE,</i>

30:30.679 --> 30:32.779
<i>WHICH WILL PROVIDE HIM</i>
<i>WITH SIX MONTHS OF FOOD TO</i>

30:32.882 --> 30:35.315
<i>SURVIVE THE WINTER AHEAD.</i>

30:35.517 --> 30:38.218
<i>BUT IN THE BROOKS RANGE,</i>
<i>AN ADULT BULL MOOSE CAN WEIGH</i>

30:38.320 --> 30:41.421
<i>MORE THAN 1,400 POUNDS</i>
<i>AND PROCESSING THE MOOSE IS</i>

30:41.523 --> 30:44.591
<i>CRITICAL TO HIS ABILITY TO</i>
<i>HAUL THE MEAT BACK TO CAMP.</i>

30:47.630 --> 30:49.162
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
WHEN YOU TAKE HIM APART,

30:49.265 --> 30:51.899
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW
HOW THEY'RE PUT TOGETHER.

30:52.001 --> 30:53.467
I REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME I WAS OUT HERE,

30:53.569 --> 30:57.304
I HAD A LITTLE BOOKLET ON
HOW TO BUTCHER MOOSE THAT

30:57.406 --> 30:58.705
I USED TO READ A LOT.

30:58.807 --> 31:00.474
AND AS MOOSE
SEASON WAS APPROACHING,

31:00.576 --> 31:02.509
I HAD IT PRETTY
WELL MEMORIZED.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.744
IT HAD SOME GOOD IDEAS IN IT.

31:03.846 --> 31:06.480
BUT OVER THE YEARS, I'VE
REFINED MY TECHNIQUES.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.516
SOMETIMES I'LL GUT 'EM FIRST.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.853
SOMETIMES I LEAVE THE SKIN ON
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MEAT.

31:12.955 --> 31:14.054
IT ALL DEPENDS
ON THE SITUATION.

31:14.189 --> 31:17.090
I TAILOR MY APPROACH TO
WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES I'M IN.

31:21.063 --> 31:24.331
BEST IS, YOU SHOOT 'EM ONE
TIME RIGHT BETWEEN TWO RIBS,

31:24.433 --> 31:26.767
HARDLY WASTE ANY MEAT AT ALL.

31:26.869 --> 31:29.369
A LEG LIKE THIS, THAT
MIGHT LAST FOR A FEW WEEKS.

31:29.471 --> 31:30.837
SO I MIGHT BRING
IT IN THE CABIN,

31:30.940 --> 31:31.939
HANG IT UP FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS.

31:32.074 --> 31:34.408
THAW OUT, SKIN IT, CUT IT
UP INTO SMALLER PIECES.

31:34.510 --> 31:36.343
THEN I GOT ALL MY STEAKS AND
MY ROASTS AND EVERYTHING FOR

31:36.445 --> 31:38.879
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
IN SMALL PIECES.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.449
TO GET YOUR MEAT THIS
WAY, IT'S SATISFYING.

31:42.551 --> 31:44.651
JUST TO COME OUT
HERE WITH A RIFLE,

31:44.753 --> 31:48.288
AND A FEW TOOLS IN YOUR PACK,
AND TAKE DOWN A BIG MOOSE LIKE

31:48.390 --> 31:50.691
THIS, PROCESS IT
ALL BY YOURSELF,

31:50.793 --> 31:52.292
GET IT BACK HOME,
GET IT PRESERVED,

31:52.394 --> 31:54.461
PROTECT IT FROM THE
BEARS AND THE SCAVENGERS,

31:54.563 --> 31:56.830
IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

31:57.099 --> 31:58.899
I'M JUST WORKING ON GETTING
THINGS OUT WITHOUT MESSING

31:59.001 --> 32:01.268
ANYTHING UP, LIKE THE
TENDERLOINS ARE RIGHT HERE.

32:01.370 --> 32:03.303
I WANT THOSE IN ONE NICE
PIECE WITHOUT ANY CUTS IN 'EM,

32:03.405 --> 32:04.538
SO I GOT TO BE CAREFUL.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.708
YOU CAN'T STICK A KNIFE DOWN
IN THERE IN A LOT OF PLACES.

32:07.810 --> 32:11.144
YOU'LL HAVE URINE OR MOOSE
FECES ALL OVER YOUR MEAT.

32:13.449 --> 32:14.748
IT'S GETTING LATE,
IT'S GETTING DARK.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.150
IT'S TIME TO GET
MY HEADLAMP OUT.

32:17.252 --> 32:18.952
I CAN FEEL THE HEART.

32:19.054 --> 32:21.321
AT SOME POINT, IT WILL GET
DISCONNECTED ENOUGH THAT I CAN

32:21.423 --> 32:23.957
PULL THE LUNGS AND
THE HEART ALL OUT.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.696
<i>[HOWLING]</i>

32:30.199 --> 32:33.800
BUNCH OF BLOOD COMING OUT.

32:39.475 --> 32:42.376
AWESOME, I'VE GOT
THE GUTS, THE LUNGS, THERE.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.579
THAT'S ALL OUT, THAT'S GOOD.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.850
THAT'S A BIG STEP IN
PRESERVING THE MEAT.

32:51.153 --> 32:53.186
LOOK AT THAT, MOOSE TONGUE.

32:53.288 --> 32:54.521
VERY GOOD FOOD.

32:54.623 --> 32:56.223
THAT IS GONNA BE DELICIOUS.

32:56.325 --> 32:57.958
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A MOOSE TONGUE.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.028
BOIL THAT UP FOR A FEW HOURS,
TASTY FOOD RIGHT THERE.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.635
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.003
IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

33:10.105 --> 33:11.838
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE
ABOUT 4:00 THIS MORNING.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.340
I WALKED ABOUT SEVEN MILES
BEFORE I PULLED THE TRIGGER

33:13.442 --> 33:15.442
AND SHOT THIS MOOSE,
SO AT THIS POINT,

33:15.544 --> 33:17.110
I GOTTA CALL IT A
NIGHT, I GOTTA HEAD HOME,

33:17.212 --> 33:18.712
AND I GOTTA GET BACK
OVER HERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

33:18.814 --> 33:20.414
FIRST LIGHT IN THE MORNING
WOULD BE THE BEST TIME.

33:20.516 --> 33:22.082
IF I CAN GET BACK
OVER HERE EARLY,

33:22.184 --> 33:23.817
GET TO THIS MEAT BEFORE
ANYTHING ELSE FINDS IT,

33:23.919 --> 33:25.018
THAT'LL BE GREAT.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.988
I GOT A SMALL LOAD THAT I
CAN CARRY TONIGHT IN MY PACK.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.590
TOMORROW, I CAN COME
AND GET THE REST OF IT.

33:35.697 --> 33:37.064
JESSIE HOLMES: I'M VERY
SENSITIVE TO ANIMALS.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.932
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED
AND CARED FOR ANIMALS.

33:39.034 --> 33:41.368
EVEN WILD ANIMALS
THAT I HUNT AND KILL,

33:41.603 --> 33:45.038
IT KINDA HURTS ME SOMETIMES
TO SEE AN ANIMAL SUFFER.

33:54.049 --> 33:56.883
¶ ¶

33:56.985 --> 34:00.287
ALL RIGHT, I GOT THIS
MOTOR ON HERE AND THE BLADE.

34:00.389 --> 34:01.521
THIS THING'S READY TO GO.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.623
NOW ALL I NEED IS SOME
TREES TO GET IN HERE,

34:03.725 --> 34:05.725
SO I CAN START PRODUCING
SOME LUMBER AND MAKE THIS

34:05.828 --> 34:07.761
THING START
PAYING ITSELF OFF.

34:07.863 --> 34:09.129
IT'S NOT A CHEAP
PIECE OF MACHINERY.

34:09.231 --> 34:12.065
IT'S GOTTA PRODUCE, JUST LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND HERE.

34:13.001 --> 34:15.268
FIRST OFF, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CLEAR MYSELF A NICE PATH SO I

34:15.370 --> 34:17.804
CAN GET THE LOGS THROUGH HERE.

34:25.814 --> 34:27.781
THIS IS HERE ON THE
GROUND, IT'S READY TO GO.

34:27.883 --> 34:29.850
IT JUST NEEDS A
LITTLE BIT OF CLEANING UP.

34:29.952 --> 34:31.151
THIS IS PRETTY
NICE RIGHT HERE.

34:31.253 --> 34:34.154
I CAN GET SOME NICE
BOARDS OUT OF THIS.

34:35.924 --> 34:37.824
ONE THING YOU WANNA DO
WHENEVER YOU'RE MILLING UP

34:37.926 --> 34:39.860
TIMBERS, YOU DON'T
WANNA MILL UP WONKY,

34:39.962 --> 34:41.795
SWOLLEN PIECES LIKE
THIS ON THE BUTT,

34:41.897 --> 34:44.131
BUT THIS'LL MAKE
SOME FINE FIREWOOD.

34:46.201 --> 34:48.468
ALL RIGHT, I GOT MY
PATHWAY CLEARED INTO HERE.

34:48.570 --> 34:50.737
DIRECT LINE TO THE SAWMILL.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.572
NICE TRAIL
COMING THROUGH HERE.

34:52.674 --> 34:55.609
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET
DOGS THROUGH HERE,

34:55.711 --> 34:58.512
ACCESS DEEPER INTO THE FOREST.

34:58.981 --> 35:01.314
THIS TREE RIGHT HERE IS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF WHERE I WANNA

35:01.416 --> 35:03.717
PUT MY PATHWAY
THROUGH TO HAUL LOGS IN.

35:03.819 --> 35:07.587
THIS IS JUST ABOUT HOW
BIG I WANT TREES 'CAUSE THEN

35:07.689 --> 35:11.591
I CAN MAKE GOOD,
SOLID, WIDE, THICK LUMBER.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.494
I COULD BE BUSY FOR A
COUPLE DAYS MILLING THIS UP.

35:14.596 --> 35:16.396
THERE'S A LOT OF
LUMBER IN THIS TREE.

35:16.498 --> 35:18.865
I WANT THIS TREE TO FALL
PERFECT RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF

35:18.967 --> 35:22.235
THIS PATHWAY, SO I HAVE NO
OBSTRUCTIONS TO DRAG IT RIGHT

35:22.337 --> 35:24.371
INTO THE MIDDLE TO
WHERE I CAN USE IT.

35:24.473 --> 35:26.039
IF IT GOES OFF TO
THE SIDE OVER THERE,

35:26.141 --> 35:27.974
OR OVER TO THE SIDE HERE
AND GETS TANGLED UP IN THESE

35:28.076 --> 35:30.076
TREES, I'M GONNA HAVE A
BIG MESS ON MY HANDS,

35:30.179 --> 35:32.612
SO I'M GONNA USE A WEDGE,
MAKE SURE THIS THING GOES

35:32.714 --> 35:34.147
RIGHT WHERE I WANT TO.

35:34.249 --> 35:35.882
I'M PRETTY GOOD
AT CUTTING TREES,

35:35.984 --> 35:38.518
FALLING TREES WHERE I WANT TO,
BUT I'M GONNA TAKE EVERY STEP

35:38.620 --> 35:42.055
I CAN TO ENSURE I DON'T
CREATE MORE WORK FOR MYSELF.

35:45.194 --> 35:47.294
WIND'S BLOWING THE OPPOSITE
DIRECTION OF WHERE I WANT THE

35:47.396 --> 35:50.197
TREE TO GO, SO IT'S A
GOOD THING I GOT A WEDGE.

35:50.299 --> 35:52.232
WOULDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO TRY
TO DROP THIS THING WITHOUT A

35:52.334 --> 35:57.604
WEDGE 'CAUSE I NEED IT TO
BE ACCURATE WHERE IT GOES.

36:09.317 --> 36:10.783
JESSIE HOLMES: SUCCESS.

36:10.885 --> 36:14.454
NOW, I GOTTA GET THIS
THING ALL PROCESSED UP.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.825
THE POINT OF LIVING
OUT HERE IS TO MAXIMIZE ON

36:18.927 --> 36:20.193
ALL THESE RESOURCES.

36:20.295 --> 36:24.297
THE FISH, THE GAME,
WOOD, WATER.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.767
AND THAT'S WHY I
CHOOSE TO LIVE OUT HERE,

36:27.869 --> 36:29.602
IS I DON'T WANNA LIVE OUT
HERE AND HAVE TO GO TO TOWN

36:29.704 --> 36:30.803
TO GET THE STUFF.

36:30.905 --> 36:33.172
I'D JUST LIVE IN TOWN THEN.

36:38.146 --> 36:40.379
I GOTTA GET THIS
TO THE SAWMILL AND

36:40.482 --> 36:42.849
START MILLING IT UP.

36:49.691 --> 36:51.190
LOG NUMBER ONE HERE.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.059
NOW IT'S TIME FOR
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

36:53.161 --> 36:55.328
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
THIS THING RUN.

36:57.332 --> 36:58.464
YEAH.

37:07.408 --> 37:13.246
¶ ¶

37:16.651 --> 37:18.251
THIS IS LOOKING AWESOME.

37:18.353 --> 37:19.919
NICE AND SMOOTH.

37:20.021 --> 37:22.154
EVERYTHING'S
CUTTING AND RUNNING GOOD.

37:22.257 --> 37:23.656
I TAKE THIS FIRST SLAB OFF,

37:23.758 --> 37:25.458
NOW I CAN START
MAKING SOME BOARDS.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.960
BOARDS MEAN I
CAN BUILD THINGS.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.497
THIS IS FREAKING
AWESOME FOR ME.

37:31.599 --> 37:33.933
THIS IS A HUGE WINDOW OF
OPPORTUNITY TO WHERE I CAN GO

37:34.035 --> 37:35.835
INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF.

37:35.937 --> 37:39.105
I CAN BUILD CAN'T STOP KENNELS
TO WHAT IT'S COMING TO.

37:39.641 --> 37:41.073
BACK WHENEVER I STARTED HERE,

37:41.175 --> 37:43.175
I HAD NOTHING
WHEN I COME TO NENANA.

37:43.278 --> 37:46.012
NOW I GOT A GREAT
DOG TEAM, SAWMILL,

37:46.114 --> 37:47.480
AWESOME KENNEL.

37:47.582 --> 37:50.216
THIS IS GONNA HELP ME TO
GROW AND EXPAND AROUND HERE,

37:50.318 --> 37:52.785
AND REACH MY FULL POTENTIAL.

37:57.258 --> 37:59.225
ALL RIGHT, MAN, THIS THING
MAKES SOME NICE SOLID BOARDS

37:59.327 --> 38:00.760
AND TIMBERS.

38:00.862 --> 38:04.363
I GOT A GOOD PILE FROM JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK HERE.

38:05.266 --> 38:07.266
NO MORE GOING TO THE
LUMBER STORE FOR ME.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.635
THIS IS A PROJECT
THAT JUST HAD TO HAPPEN.

38:09.737 --> 38:12.305
NOW, THIS PLACE IS GONNA
REALLY BE GROWING NEXT YEAR.

38:12.407 --> 38:14.407
SAWMILL, CHECK.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.247
SUE AIKENS: NATURE
DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY,

38:21.349 --> 38:23.649
IT JUST MAKES IT WORTHWHILE.

38:33.428 --> 38:36.929
TIME FOR ME TO GO ON A LITTLE
SCOUT BEFORE THE DAY IS DONE.

38:38.433 --> 38:40.833
<i>NARRATOR: HAVING HEARD</i>
<i>WOLF HOWLS THIS MORNING,</i>

38:40.935 --> 38:43.536
<i>IT'S CRUCIAL FOR SUE TO SCOUT</i>
<i>HER SURROUNDINGS IN THE REFUGE</i>

38:43.638 --> 38:46.172
<i>FOR ANY THREATS</i>
<i>BEFORE NIGHTFALL.</i>

38:47.342 --> 38:48.808
SUE AIKENS: ALONG WITH
THE TEMPERATURES DROPPING,

38:48.910 --> 38:50.843
THE DARK IS ON ITS HEELS.

38:50.945 --> 38:53.546
AND THERE'S WOLVES HERE.

38:53.648 --> 38:55.748
THEY'RE NOT PETS.

38:55.984 --> 39:00.386
I AM A SCOOBY SNACK NOW
FOR ANYTHING WALKING AROUND.

39:01.623 --> 39:05.324
I'M NOT AFRAID OF IT, BUT GOSH
DARN I'M GONNA RESPECT IT.

39:07.462 --> 39:09.395
SURE ENOUGH,
THIS IS WOLF TRACK.

39:09.497 --> 39:10.997
FRESH WOLF TRACK.

39:11.099 --> 39:14.000
I'M GONNA SAY HE'S GOING
THIS DIRECTION BECAUSE I THINK

39:14.102 --> 39:17.003
I SEE A COUPLE OF
NAIL MARKS THERE.

39:17.305 --> 39:21.007
JUST LIKE ME, A LITTLE
LONE WOLF ON THE TUNDRA.

39:23.511 --> 39:26.379
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING, LITTLE BUDDY?

39:26.848 --> 39:31.150
THEY'RE TOP PREDATORS, SO
HOW DO YOU TURN A FAT CHICK

39:31.252 --> 39:34.153
WITH A RIFLE INTO HAVING LESS
OF AN ADVANTAGE?

39:35.757 --> 39:37.423
NUMBER ONE, TRY
TO GET HER TO RUN.

39:37.525 --> 39:40.726
BUT NUMBER TWO,
SIMPLY OUTWAIT ME.

39:40.995 --> 39:43.663
NATURE ITSELF IS GONNA GIVE
THAT ANIMAL THE ADVANTAGE

39:43.765 --> 39:46.198
REALLY QUICK.

39:48.369 --> 39:51.971
FOG COMING IN, DARK COMING
ON, COLDER TEMPERATURES,

39:52.073 --> 39:54.306
AND I'VE GOT TWO
LEGS AND I'M CHUNKY.

39:54.409 --> 39:57.643
AND THAT ANIMAL HAS GOT
FOUR PAWS AND DETERMINATION,

39:57.745 --> 40:00.379
AND HAS A BEAK THAT CAN
SMELL LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS,

40:00.481 --> 40:03.816
SO GAME ON, LITTLE DUDE.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.086
FOLLOWING HIS TRAIL
AND THEN IT'S LIKE POOF!

40:07.188 --> 40:08.320
LOOK WHAT HE DID.

40:08.423 --> 40:10.089
HE HAS BEEN HANGING OUT HERE,

40:10.191 --> 40:12.324
JUST WATCHING
CAMP GOING, COOL.

40:12.427 --> 40:13.893
OKAY, I SEE
YOUR HABITS, MAN.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.227
WHAT A NICE LITTLE LAIR.

40:15.329 --> 40:18.197
HE'S GOT IT ALL
CUBBIED OUT ON BOTH SIDES.

40:18.299 --> 40:21.100
THIS IS A GREAT,
GREAT HIDEOUT.

40:21.402 --> 40:25.671
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW IT EXISTS,
A LITTLE BIT WISER.

40:28.276 --> 40:31.977
<i>[DISTANT HOWL]</i>

40:32.080 --> 40:34.547
RIGHT OVER THERE.

40:34.982 --> 40:37.216
I BETTER TURN THIS OFF.

40:37.819 --> 40:39.719
THERE HE IS!

40:39.821 --> 40:40.920
OH MY GOD!

40:41.022 --> 40:43.322
AND HE ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE A BIG OLE PUMA.

40:43.424 --> 40:46.525
WELL, HE'S DEFINITELY
GOING FOR HIGHER GROUND NOW.

40:47.628 --> 40:51.163
<i>[SUE HOWLS]</i>

40:52.300 --> 40:57.436
<i>[WOLVES HOWL]</i>

40:57.538 --> 41:00.106
OH (BLEEP),
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE.

41:13.254 --> 41:15.121
HOW COOL IS THAT?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.957
AS COOL AS IT IS THAT
I'M ABLE TO HOWL AND THEY'RE

41:18.059 --> 41:19.959
HOWLING BACK, THE
TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS,

41:20.061 --> 41:22.595
IS IT'S GETTING PRETTY
DARK AND IT'S GONNA GET A LOT

41:22.697 --> 41:25.431
DARKER REALLY FAST.

41:27.201 --> 41:29.135
I CAN'T FORGET THESE ARE WILD.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.304
THESE AREN'T MY LITTLE TAME
DUDES AROUND KAVIK THAT GO,

41:32.406 --> 41:33.472
YEAH, YOU KNOW?

41:33.574 --> 41:35.007
SHE DOES THIS, SHE DOES THAT.

41:35.109 --> 41:37.943
UH-UH, THESE ARE
THE APEX DUDES.

41:38.045 --> 41:40.513
IT COULD BE A PLOY TO
KEEP ME OUT LATE ENOUGH TO

41:40.615 --> 41:41.947
CHEW MY BUTT.

41:42.049 --> 41:43.115
I DON'T NEED THAT.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.918
I NEED TO NOT BE A PORK
CHOP AND I NEED TO GET HOME.

41:46.187 --> 41:49.655
THIS IS SOMETHING I'M
GONNA TAKE WITH ME FOREVER.

41:50.625 --> 41:51.757
I'M AN EXPLORER.

41:51.859 --> 41:53.692
I LIKE TO SEE WHAT'S
OVER THE NEXT HILL.

41:53.795 --> 41:55.928
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

41:56.030 --> 41:57.997
THIS IS WHY I DO IT.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.269
GLENN VILLENEUVE: IF YOU'RE
LIVING OUT HERE AND YOU'RE

42:03.371 --> 42:06.672
CONFIDENT IN YOUR SKILLS,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

42:18.719 --> 42:20.152
I'LL LEAVE MY
CANOE RIGHT HERE.

42:20.254 --> 42:22.922
THE MOOSE IS UP
THIS WAY IN THE WOODS.

42:23.024 --> 42:25.858
I'LL USE MY SLED, TRANSPORT
SEVERAL LOADS OF MEAT DOWN

42:25.960 --> 42:27.193
HERE TO THE SHORELINE.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.563
THEN I CAN USE THE CANOE TO
TAKE IT ALL BACK TO CAMP.

42:34.836 --> 42:37.469
BIG THING ON MY MIND IS BEARS.

42:37.572 --> 42:39.972
I DEFINITELY WANT MY
GUN LOADED AND READY,

42:40.074 --> 42:41.774
AND I JUST SCOPE IT
OUT FROM A DISTANCE.

42:41.876 --> 42:43.943
I TRY TO LOOK AHEAD
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,

42:44.045 --> 42:46.078
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

42:46.180 --> 42:49.348
I DON'T WANNA GET A
SURPRISE UP THERE.

42:49.450 --> 42:50.916
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANYTHING'S BEEN AROUND,

42:51.018 --> 42:53.652
THAT'S GOOD.

42:54.288 --> 42:55.754
NOTHING FOUND THE MEAT YET.

42:55.857 --> 42:57.890
LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
HERE JUST LIKE I LEFT IT.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.192
THAT'S GOOD.

43:01.229 --> 43:02.228
THE MEAT'S ALL HERE.

43:02.330 --> 43:03.262
NOTHING FOUND IT YET.

43:03.364 --> 43:05.464
BUT IT IS JUST A
MATTER OF TIME.

43:05.566 --> 43:07.633
A BEAR WILL FIND
THIS KILL SITE.

43:07.735 --> 43:09.935
I'VE GOTTA TRANSPORT ALL
THIS MEAT BACK TO MY CAMP

43:10.037 --> 43:11.203
AS SOON AS I CAN.

43:11.305 --> 43:13.105
BECAUSE INEVITABLY,
GIVEN ENOUGH TIME,

43:13.207 --> 43:15.608
A BEAR WILL FIND IT.

43:15.943 --> 43:17.977
IT'S A PRECISE OPERATION,
BUTCHERING A MOOSE.

43:18.079 --> 43:20.512
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU
JUST DO WITH ONE KNIFE.

43:21.349 --> 43:22.815
YOU GOTTA
UNDERSTAND THE ANATOMY.

43:22.917 --> 43:24.216
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND
HOW IT ALL GOES TOGETHER IF

43:24.318 --> 43:26.051
YOU WANNA TAKE IT APART.

43:26.153 --> 43:29.889
THERE, GOT MY RIBS;
GOT MY MOOSE ALL CUT UP.

43:31.092 --> 43:33.659
IT'S IN PIECES THAT ARE A SIZE
I CAN PUT IN THE SLED NOW.

43:33.761 --> 43:36.395
I'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE EACH OF
THESE LOADS DOWN TO THE LAKE,

43:36.497 --> 43:38.998
GET 'EM TO MY CANOE, AND
THEN PADDLE HOME WITH IT.

43:48.943 --> 43:50.776
TAKING DOWN THE PELVIS FIRST.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.177
IT'S GOT THE
TENDERLOINS ON IT,

43:52.280 --> 43:53.779
THE BACKSTRAP.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.048
I DON'T WANT THOSE
TENDERLOINS GOING TO A GRIZZLY.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.350
THERE.

43:58.653 --> 44:00.419
WHEN I'M PICKING
WHICH LOAD TO TAKE,

44:00.521 --> 44:02.087
I TAKE THE BEST MEAT FIRST.

44:02.189 --> 44:03.455
THERE.

44:03.557 --> 44:05.891
BECAUSE IF A BEAR COMES
ALONG AND MESSES UP THIS MEAT,

44:05.993 --> 44:10.129
I WANNA HAVE THE BEST
MEAT WITH ME FOR BACK HOME.

44:13.067 --> 44:16.302
OKAY, GOT THE MEAT
ALL LOADED IN THE CANOE.

44:16.404 --> 44:19.271
TIME TO HEAD BACK TO CAMP.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.550
OH, IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME.

44:31.652 --> 44:35.220
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY,
BUT I GOT MY MOOSE MEAT.

44:35.890 --> 44:38.624
MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS TO KEEP THIS MEAT

44:38.726 --> 44:41.093
COOL, CLEAN, DRY.

44:41.195 --> 44:44.229
BY PUTTING IT ON THIS
RACK, IT'LL STAY CLEAN.

44:45.166 --> 44:46.765
THIS IS MY LOW MEAT RACK.

44:46.867 --> 44:48.767
RIGHT NOW TONIGHT, ALL
I CAN DO IS PUT IT HERE.

44:48.869 --> 44:50.636
IF A BEAR COMES AROUND, I'LL
BE ABLE TO SEE IT RIGHT OUT

44:50.738 --> 44:51.804
THE WINDOW.

44:51.906 --> 44:53.439
I'VE GOT A HIGH MEAT POLE.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.007
I'VE GOT A PLATFORM CACHE.

44:55.109 --> 44:58.811
LATER, I'LL HANG IT UP HIGHER
TO PROTECT IT FROM SCAVENGERS.

45:02.616 --> 45:06.018
IT'S NICE TO UTILIZE RESOURCES
FROM RIGHT NEAR WHERE YOU LIVE

45:06.120 --> 45:07.753
TO GET THE BASIC
THINGS YOU NEED.

45:07.855 --> 45:09.488
THAT'S WHAT
SUBSISTENCE IS ABOUT,

45:09.590 --> 45:12.124
GETTING THE RESOURCES THAT
YOU NEED TO SUBSIST RIGHT OFF

45:12.226 --> 45:14.960
OF THE LOCAL LAND
AROUND WHERE YOU LIVE.

45:18.499 --> 45:22.201
AH, THAT IS SUCH A GOOD
FEELING TO GET ALL THAT MEAT

45:22.303 --> 45:26.171
OVER HERE SAFE AND SOUND.

45:26.674 --> 45:28.941
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

45:29.043 --> 45:31.343
LOT OF WORK, BUT I GOT A
LOT OF FOOD RIGHT HERE.

45:31.445 --> 45:33.178
THAT'S GONNA BE GOOD EATING.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.615
I'M GONNA CALL IT A NIGHT.

45:39.887 --> 45:41.553
AGNES HAILSTONE: WE'RE
JUST ABOUT CAPABLE OF DOING

45:41.655 --> 45:44.256
ANYTHING TOGETHER.

45:47.328 --> 45:50.496
I WAS JUST GONNA TAKE
THE HEAD AND THE TAIL OFF.

45:51.298 --> 45:53.832
TING HAILSTONE: FIRST
WHITEFISH BEFORE IT FREEZES UP.

45:57.104 --> 46:00.172
AGNES HAILSTONE:

46:03.911 --> 46:05.344
TING HAILSTONE: IT'S

46:05.446 --> 46:07.479
HOT MEAL AFTER
TRAVELING IN COLD,

46:07.581 --> 46:09.181
AND THEN CHECKING A NET, UH?

46:09.283 --> 46:12.017
AGNES HAILSTONE: YEAH,
ESPECIALLY WITH THE COLD WATER.

46:14.055 --> 46:15.621
RIGHT ON, IT'S DONE.

46:15.723 --> 46:16.789
TING HAILSTONE: RIGHT ON.

46:16.891 --> 46:17.923
AGNES HAILSTONE:

46:18.025 --> 46:19.124

46:19.226 --> 46:20.659
AGNES HAILSTONE: YOU GUYS
WANNA JUST SHARE A PLATE,

46:20.761 --> 46:21.794
OR YOU GUYS WANT
YOUR OWN PLATE?

46:21.896 --> 46:23.695
TING HAILSTONE: WE
COULD SHARE A PLATE.

46:23.798 --> 46:24.963
THANK YOU, MOM.

46:25.066 --> 46:26.065

46:26.167 --> 46:27.533
QUTAN HAILSTONE:

46:27.635 --> 46:29.268

46:29.370 --> 46:30.769
TING HAILSTONE: YOU

46:30.871 --> 46:31.837

46:36.577 --> 46:38.343
AGNES HAILSTONE: WE GOT LOTS
OF STUFF TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

46:38.446 --> 46:39.945
WE HAVE ENOUGH MEAT
WITH ALL THAT CARIBOU, UH?

46:40.047 --> 46:42.181
WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE A
GOOD START AT WINTER.

46:42.283 --> 46:44.450
WE HAVE ENOUGH FISH.

46:44.552 --> 46:46.351
NOW WE JUST GOTTA GO
HUNKER DOWN AND WAIT FOR

46:46.454 --> 46:47.920

46:48.022 --> 46:49.555
