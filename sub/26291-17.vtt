00:06.528 --> 00:08.965
Put the plates in the
sink. We need to go.

What?

00:30.639 --> 00:33.076
Want to hold onto
thisjob, right?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.208

stay right there, okay?

00:38.342 --> 00:40.344
It's okay.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.087
Can we leave now?Huh?

00:46.437 --> 00:48.918
Go... all right. Guys,
have a great day, okay?

00:48.961 --> 00:50.267
All right, hop in,
buckle up, okay?Bye, Dad.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.531
Love you.Hey... take the scenic

Nathan?

01:42.189 --> 01:43.712
Dwayne, hey.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.280
Come by to grab
some stuff?

01:46.323 --> 01:47.672
What stuff?

01:47.716 --> 01:50.197
I mean, you can leave it
here as long as you like.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.547
Shouldn't you be
at Camp Lejeune? Huh?

01:52.590 --> 01:56.333
I-I was until I got
the call from HQ.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.857
Which you didn't get.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.295
What call, Nathan?

02:01.338 --> 02:04.428
HQ was supposed
to give you a call this morning.

02:04.472 --> 02:07.431
Oh... my phone was off.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.737
What's going on?

02:08.780 --> 02:10.304
We've been reassigned.

02:10.347 --> 02:14.046
I'm S-- Interim Special Agent
in Charge of the Southeast.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.396
HQ was supposed
to inform you.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.875
Yeah, well, they didn't.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.182
So, if you're here, wh-where
am I supposed to be?

02:19.226 --> 02:23.360
Honestly?
No one knows.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.235
This is a joke, right?

02:28.278 --> 02:30.106
There's no such
place as Bovis.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.760
Bovis, Mississippi.

02:31.803 --> 02:33.196
Right across the state line.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.024
And we have
to go there, why?

02:35.067 --> 02:38.419
They're looking for Petty
Officer First Class Dana Wilson.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.725
She's been on bereavement leave
for her aunt who died.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.423
Been U.A. for a week since.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.555
Honestly, Pride, are things
so slow at Belle Chasse

02:44.599 --> 02:46.340
that we have to go to Bovis?

02:46.383 --> 02:47.819
I wouldn't know.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.430
Well, you're the SAC.

02:49.473 --> 02:50.822
Not anymore.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.738
I've been reassigned,
effective immediately.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.044
What? What happened?I don't know.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.611
Went into my office...

02:56.654 --> 02:57.916
and someone else was there.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.527
Well, there's got to be
an official reason.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.050
What did HQ say?

03:01.093 --> 03:02.878
I was busy this morning.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.096
They left messages.
I called back.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.707
They haven't returned, so

03:05.750 --> 03:07.839
I came here.

03:07.883 --> 03:10.146
Well, that sounds way more
important than a missing sailor.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.191
We should probably

03:11.234 --> 03:13.018
stay here and help
him sort it out.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.019
No, Gregorio.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.064
You and Christopher

03:15.107 --> 03:16.935
need to go to Bovis.
Work the case.

03:16.979 --> 03:18.937
Find the sailor.
I'll be fine.

03:18.981 --> 03:21.418
Go on, get out of here.
Learn things.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.942
Okay, but, uh...

03:23.986 --> 03:26.684
keep us updated.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.819
You think I'm holding
something back, I'm not.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.342
No insights on what happened?

03:32.386 --> 03:35.084
I got top marks
on my last performance review.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.999
Not that I put
much stock in that.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.785
Bosses said they appreciate
my unique methods.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.527
You are one of a kind.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.963
Well... no use speculating.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.965
I'm gonna make
some more calls.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.315
All right? I'll get
to the bottom of this.

03:48.358 --> 03:51.448
Well, look, you should
have your desk back

03:51.492 --> 03:53.145
while you're here.

03:53.189 --> 03:56.497
Nah... not my desk anymore.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.672
I'll just find a place.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.372
Got to be office politics.

04:02.416 --> 04:04.853
Someone in D.C. got their nose
out of joint about Pride.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.681
Probably want their cousin
to get the job.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.422
Uh, NCIS doesn't work like that.

04:08.465 --> 04:10.293
Every place works like that.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.513
Kind of wish we were
back in New Orleans with him.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.906
We're as far from New
Orleans as we can get.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.301
A place like this... makes
a New York girl really nervous.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.651
Small town, Gregorio.
It ain't gonna bite.

04:20.695 --> 04:21.826
Says you.

04:21.870 --> 04:22.871
Looks like someone took a bite

04:22.914 --> 04:24.046
out of Bovis.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.831
Hit on hard times, I guess.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.442
What in the... hmm?

04:28.485 --> 04:32.097
Just like perfectly normal
strangers waving hello?

04:32.141 --> 04:33.534
It's common courtesy.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.318
It's what happens
when everyone knows everyone.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.495
Yeah.Should make it easier to
find Petty Officer Wilson.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.281
Yeah, I'm not seeing
a police station.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.631
Yeah, it's a one-horse town.
We'll find it.

04:43.674 --> 04:47.156
Excuse me, sir, can you tell us
where the police station is?

04:47.199 --> 04:49.985
First of all,
I don't talk to cops.

04:50.028 --> 04:52.727
Second of all,
I'm not a damn tour guide.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.122
See, Gregorio?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
There's rude
people here, too.
Yeah,

04:58.950 --> 05:01.126
I should teach that creep
some manners.

05:01.170 --> 05:03.390
No doubt. Let's
look around.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.963
Police station
andthe mayor's office.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.096
Guess they
multitask here.Yup.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.621
Hello? Anyone there?

05:21.886 --> 05:24.976
"Gone to lunch."Yeah, well, the good news is

05:25.020 --> 05:29.067
there's not a lot
of dining options.You got that right.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.069
Charlie Conroy at your service.You the chief
of police?

05:31.113 --> 05:33.071
Yes, I am the chief,
I'm the deputy,

05:33.115 --> 05:34.464
and the 911 operator.

05:34.508 --> 05:35.944
Wear a lot of hats.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.816
That's nothing.
He's also the mayor,

05:38.860 --> 05:41.428
the Realtor, and he operates
the car dealership.

05:41.471 --> 05:43.734
She miss anything,
Charlie?Well, I am

05:43.778 --> 05:45.867
the only notary
in a 25-mile radius.You like

05:45.910 --> 05:47.477
to keep yourself busy, huh?

05:47.521 --> 05:49.087
Well, Bovis had
a rough time

05:49.131 --> 05:51.176
when the dog food factory
shut down a few years ago.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.788
Every time somebody
tried to pull stakes
and close down their business,

05:53.831 --> 05:55.442
I just tried to jump in
and help out a little bit.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.095
Charlie kept the town
on life support.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.359
But the dog food factory's
up and running again.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.490
Things are getting better.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.839
But you're not here
for a history lesson.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.493
You're here to find out
about Dana Wilson.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.756
Oh, sad to hear she's missing.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.889
Mm.Dana was such a good girl.

06:07.932 --> 06:08.933
Did you know her?

06:08.977 --> 06:09.978
Course.Yeah, she
grew up here

06:10.021 --> 06:12.284
with her aunt--
homecoming queen,

06:12.328 --> 06:15.200
went to state for track and
field, sang in the choir.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.115
Yeah, then she joined the Navy
after she graduated high school

06:17.159 --> 06:18.726
and went away
and never came back.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.945
Well, she came back last week
for her aunt's funeral.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.383
Well, now, the funeral was
last week, but she wasn't here.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.297
All right, well, we'd like
to check out her aunt's house,

06:25.341 --> 06:27.604
if that's okay,
just cover all our bases.

06:27.648 --> 06:28.997
You bet. I'll be happy
to take you out there

06:29.040 --> 06:30.346
if you like.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.565
Appreciate it.All righty.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.044
Keep that burger hot.
I'll be right back.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.049
This doesn't feel right.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.269
Pride getting removed
from his job, no explanation.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.228
Feels like a conspiracy.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.578
Yeah, to me, too,
Sebastian,

06:44.621 --> 06:46.710
but staring at Dwayne
on the phone won't help,

06:46.754 --> 06:48.146
especially when you're
supposed to be tracking down

06:48.190 --> 06:49.626
Petty Officer Wilson.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.802
Right. Well, I mean,
I contacted her friends,

06:51.846 --> 06:53.761
remaining family,
members from her unit--

06:53.804 --> 06:56.851
no one has any idea
where she is.Well, any suspicious activity

06:56.894 --> 06:58.592
before she disappeared?

06:58.635 --> 07:01.421
No. I mean, I did
a thorough background--

07:01.464 --> 07:03.553
she's as squared away
as a sailor gets.

07:03.597 --> 07:06.164
Why'd she go U.A.?I don't know.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.471
I am working on getting approval
to remotely access her phone,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.342
see if I can't get a ping.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.518
Okay. Let's get a rush
on that approval.

07:11.561 --> 07:12.910
Okay.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.130
Talked to everyone

07:15.173 --> 07:16.958
who'd take my calls in D.C.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.395
No one knows
why I got reassigned.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.918
Or if they do, they won't say.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.746
I reached out to a friend at
the Department of the Navy.

07:22.790 --> 07:23.747
She should have some insight.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.270
Appreciate that.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.924
Not sure it'll help, but...Well, someone made

07:26.968 --> 07:28.709
this decision-- there's
got to be a reason.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.581
Well, I can't just
stick around here waiting.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.801
Where are you going?

07:33.844 --> 07:36.064
Clear my head.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.988
Oh, it's a little early,
don't you think?

07:47.031 --> 07:49.643
Figured you might need it--
considering...

07:49.686 --> 07:51.471
Considering Hannah
already called you

07:51.514 --> 07:53.821
and told you what
was going on.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.737
I'm your brother...
and head bartender.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.653
Who better to share
your troubles with?No. I'm not drinking.

07:59.696 --> 08:04.048
And since I'm not exactly
sure what my troubles are,

08:04.092 --> 08:06.137
I can't share
'em yet, either.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.574
Fair enough, D.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.228
Figured I'd help out
with the happy hour rush.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.882
I got the situation on lockdown.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.275
Your services
are not required.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.453
Although, of course,
always appreciated.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.415
This is where
Petty Officer Wilson grew up?

08:23.459 --> 08:25.722
Yes, sir.
It's not much to look at now,

08:25.766 --> 08:29.117
but... let me tell you,
back in the old day,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.249
well, Lorraine took
real good care of this place.

08:31.293 --> 08:33.077
Yeah, but after Dana left,

08:33.121 --> 08:34.905
well, Lorraine get sick...

08:34.948 --> 08:37.342
Place went to seed?Not for long,

08:37.385 --> 08:40.563
because Lorraine left the house
to the town of Bovis.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.392
We gonna tear it down and
build ourselves a new school.

08:46.003 --> 08:47.352
Looks like someone was here

08:47.396 --> 08:49.311
sorting through Aunt
Lorraine's stuff.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.400
Maybe Petty Officer Wilson
did come back.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.273
What's up, Sebastian?

08:55.317 --> 08:57.275
Hey. So, I got approval
to access

08:57.319 --> 08:59.974
Petty Officer Wilson's phone.
I just turned it on,

09:00.017 --> 09:02.585
and according to the GPS,
it's in Bovis.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.065
Okay. Where in Bovis?

09:04.108 --> 09:05.806
Her aunt's house.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.372
We're in her aunt's house.
There's no sign

09:07.416 --> 09:08.591
of Dana or her phone.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.202
All right, hold on.
I'm dialing the number.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.999
It's coming from in here.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.700
I don't see anything.

09:30.744 --> 09:34.138
I think it's
under the floorboards.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.664
These boards are loose.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.331
Aw, geez.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.942
What? What happened?

09:54.985 --> 09:59.294
We found the phone, Sebastian,
and Petty Officer Wilson.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.080
I'm heading back to NCIS.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.995
Dwayne, you don't have to.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.128
Missing person case
just turned into a murder.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.304
Course I have to.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.828
See you in a bit.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.973
Hands where
I can see 'em.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.018
Get 'em up!

10:28.062 --> 10:30.107
Turn around slow.

10:33.545 --> 10:34.938
Isler?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.681
What the hell is going on?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.988
Heard you were
looking for a job.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.350
Why was I removed
from my SAC position?

10:55.393 --> 10:56.699
Kent Crawford.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.267
You were at his house
this morning,

10:59.310 --> 11:00.747
keeping an eye on him.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.532
How did you...Because we've been
keeping an eye on you.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.794
I don't understand.

11:04.838 --> 11:06.970
Apollyon.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.668
They were responsible

11:08.711 --> 11:10.713
for the kidnapping
and murder of your father.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.106
You took them down.

11:12.149 --> 11:14.674
Except for Avery Walker.

11:16.763 --> 11:20.331
Body was never recovered
after the prison riot

11:20.375 --> 11:22.682
that supposedly killed him.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.423
And you've been discreetly
looking into his disappearance.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.904
Dead bodies don't
just disappear.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.384
You've been running
background

11:29.427 --> 11:31.473
on current and former
employees of the prison.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.605
Possible accomplices.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.912
Kent Crawford
is your current focus.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.610
He quit his prison job
days after the riot.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.786
Changed addresses twice

11:39.829 --> 11:41.352
within the last
three months.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.746
That's why you're no longer SAC.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.488
If official Washington wanted
me to back off,

11:46.531 --> 11:47.750
they would have told me.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
But we believe you,
Dwayne.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.713
Let me ask you.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.542
Do you recognize this?

11:57.586 --> 11:59.980
Bar code tattoo
from Amelia Parsons.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.809
Contained intel on Apollyon.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.289
But was too damaged
to get much off it.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.900
Not anymore.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.815
Team of analysts
at Langley were able

12:08.858 --> 12:10.512
to reconstruct it;
we got the mother lode.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.732
Enough information
on their MO to figure out

12:12.775 --> 12:15.082
elements of Apollyon
are still active.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.954
And Avery Walker is still alive.You keep saying "we."

12:19.260 --> 12:22.089
A task force organized
to take out Apollyon for good.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.091
Small group.

12:24.134 --> 12:26.920
Culled from the CIA, FBI,
other agencies.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.922
I'm running it.

12:28.965 --> 12:32.273
Still doesn't explain why
I got removed from my job.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.884
Apollyon maintains sources
within the government.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.843
Anyone on the task force...

12:36.886 --> 12:39.019
needs official cover for why
they left their post.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.498
I stepped down weeks ago.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.500
So this is a job offer?

12:42.544 --> 12:45.895
You have the most experience
going after Apollyon.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.160
And...

12:50.204 --> 12:51.771
you have skin in the game.

12:51.814 --> 12:55.122
And we believe you
about Kent Crawford.How do you know?

12:55.165 --> 12:56.950
Accessed his financials.

12:56.993 --> 12:59.822
Found a numbered account
with six figures.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.171
Where'd the money come from?

13:01.215 --> 13:04.044
That's what the task force
is here to find out.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.220
Would you like
to join us?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.135
Who's your boss?

13:08.178 --> 13:10.398
Pride...

13:10.441 --> 13:13.053
that's need-to-know, man.

13:15.707 --> 13:16.839
It's my team.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.972
Yeah.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.495
It's probably about
your murdered sailor.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.149
You should go.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.977
Hey.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.153
Think about what I've said.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.981
It's a lot to process.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.896
I'll be in touch.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.202
I can tell you one thing I feel.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.117
I don't like you spying on me.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.163
Don't think of me as a spy.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.296
Think of me as an angel...

13:39.340 --> 13:41.385
on your shoulder.

13:44.127 --> 13:47.043
Petty Officer Wilson's body
was found wrapped in plastic

13:47.087 --> 13:49.611
and buried under
her aunt's floorboards.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.222
I sent Dr. Wade
and Sebastian off to Bovis

13:52.266 --> 13:53.833
to examine the crime scene.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.357
Good. Any idea
of cause of death?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.837
Mm-mm. Nothing concrete.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.796
Lasalle and Gregorio
are thinking blunt force.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.624
And I'm assuming no witnesses?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.017
No one in
Bovis even knew

14:04.060 --> 14:06.106
that Petty Officer
Wilson was there.

14:06.149 --> 14:09.413
You should send Doc Wade
and Sebastian to Bovis.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.069
I just--
Dwayne.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.115
Hmm?

14:15.158 --> 14:16.159
You okay?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.727
Yeah, yeah, I'm... of course.

14:20.642 --> 14:24.994
Look, it's clear that
you're... distracted.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.302
This have something to do
with the reassignment?

14:28.345 --> 14:29.912
No.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.261
This is just bar business.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.828
Okay? I'm good.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.613
Uh, just, just keep me
updated, all right?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.225
Okay.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.362
Initial theory's correct.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.669
Poor girl was
bludgeoned to death.

14:47.712 --> 14:51.629
And what's the powdered
substance in the plastic?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.805
Uh, I'm guessing it's lye.
Suspect covered her in it.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.286
That's attempting
to speed up the decomp.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.071
Someone wanted her
to disappear.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.203
Makes sense since
we can't find her car either.

15:00.247 --> 15:02.075
Probably dumped.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.164
Well, I also found

15:04.207 --> 15:06.470
another foreign
chemical substance

15:06.514 --> 15:08.168
separate from the lye.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.647
Yeah, I'll take it
back to the lab, analyze it.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.084
How does a girl visit

15:11.127 --> 15:13.869
her hometown of 400 people
and get murdered

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
without anyone knowing?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.742
Well, I wish I could
help you out, but, uh,

15:17.786 --> 15:19.309
we just had no
idea she was here.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.703
Yeah, someone knew.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.923
Well, like I said,
I'm a one-man shop.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.100
Don't have a forensics
team, no investigators.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.232
Now, you guys ought to have
some sort of technology

15:29.276 --> 15:31.060
that can figure out
what happened to her.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.976
Well, it's not that simple,
Chief Conroy.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.586
I mean, we'll run our tests,

15:35.630 --> 15:37.893
but we'll still need
to talk to some folks.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.242
Well, that'd be all right.

15:39.286 --> 15:42.289
Is anyone in town
you can think of that

15:42.332 --> 15:44.595
might do our petty officer
any harm?Well...

15:44.639 --> 15:47.381
Dana's been gone for
years, like I said.

15:47.424 --> 15:51.080
That doesn't leave much
room for local trouble.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.560
What about this guy?

15:54.475 --> 15:56.259
It's the guy that was
at the bar yesterday.

15:56.303 --> 15:57.565
Yeah, that's
Pierce Evans.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.871
He used to be a big deal
around these parts.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.570
He was a high school captain
of the football team,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.093
uh, homecoming king.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.095
Dana was his queen.
Yep.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.010
That was the perfect
high school couple,

16:08.054 --> 16:11.013
but then Dana had ambitions
to go off and see the world.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.275
And Pierce became a drunk.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.147
Well, he became
much more than that.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.192
That boy got into meth.

16:16.236 --> 16:17.933
Yeah, threw
his whole future away.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.153
Guessing he didn't take
her joining the Navy too well.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.632
No, sir,
he didn't.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.330
Now, we don't have
much trouble here in Bovis,

16:23.373 --> 16:24.722
but what trouble we do have,

16:24.766 --> 16:26.507
that Pierce is usually
right in the middle of it.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.248
You got an address
on this Pierce?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.163
Eh, well, sort of.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.426
Pierce is in between
addresses right now.

16:32.469 --> 16:35.646
He lives in his motor home
and he parks in various spots.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.867
Nice spot.Yeah, Bovis is a nice place,
isn't it?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.174
Why, you see this up here?
This building right here?

16:41.217 --> 16:43.306
Well, that's
a dog food factory.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.787
That don't look like much,
but let me tell you,

16:45.830 --> 16:48.050
when that reopened,
it saved this town.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.660
People got jobs again.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.053
And hope.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.144
Looks like Pierce missed out
on the hope part.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.406
Now, Pierce, he don't have

16:56.450 --> 16:57.973
a real good history
with law enforcement.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.584
I think it's best
if I approach him alone,

17:00.628 --> 17:01.890
let him see
a friendly face first.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.805
Well, is he the type
to have a gun?

17:03.848 --> 17:05.849
Well, this is Bovis.
Everybody got a gun.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.069
Pierce, it's Charlie.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.506
Now, I'm gonna need you
to come on out of there,

17:09.550 --> 17:11.421
nice and calm with your hands
where I can see 'em.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.561
Got a rabbit!

17:28.351 --> 17:30.353
So much for
"nice and calm."

17:35.967 --> 17:37.143
You've come up in the world.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.710
Apollyon task force works
in the margins,

17:39.754 --> 17:42.061
just like our target.Out of sight, out of mind.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.585
Something like that.

17:44.628 --> 17:45.977
I'll introduce you later.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.067
We've got representatives
of various agencies--

17:48.110 --> 17:50.765
FBI, Homeland, CIA.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.507
CIA working side-by-side
with law enforcement?

17:53.550 --> 17:56.423
Won't that complicate
arrests and prosecution?

17:56.466 --> 17:59.078
Prosecution's not the endgame.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.558
Will Kirby, Dwayne Pride.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.125
Kirby runs the
more aggressive

18:03.169 --> 18:05.867
element
of our task force.
Ah.

18:05.910 --> 18:07.825
What agency you
working for?

18:07.869 --> 18:10.393
Uh, there's no category for me.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.483
All right, so I'm guessing
Special Forces, Black Ops?

18:13.527 --> 18:17.270
Nah, think of me as
a big game hunter.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.795
What is the goal
of this operation?

18:20.838 --> 18:22.188
To dismantle Apollyon.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.015
Take down
its remaining members.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.279
Take 'em down or take 'em out?

18:26.322 --> 18:28.498
Whatever works.
Look...

18:28.542 --> 18:30.196
we'll take them
into custody if we can.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.415
But we need to be prepared.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.114
You being on the task force
goes a long way.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.854
Yeah, well, I'm
not sure I am yet.

18:36.898 --> 18:39.814
You said you downloaded
the rest of the intel

18:39.857 --> 18:41.163
from Amelia's tattoo?

18:41.207 --> 18:42.425
I wanted to take a look.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.992
It's all here.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.255
Uh, safe house locations,

18:46.299 --> 18:49.084
operatives' names,
financial information.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.609
But I can't let you see it until
you commit to the task force.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.177
Why's that?Because anyone read in
becomes an instant target.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.267
All right, let me...
I'll show you one thing.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.185
Intel on Kent Crawford.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.839
Over the last few months,

19:04.882 --> 19:06.841
someone's paid him $200,000.

19:06.884 --> 19:09.409
Recently, he purchased a condo
in Costa Rica.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.585
How'd you get this information?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.282
Uh, don't ask.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.502
Are you saying

19:15.545 --> 19:17.199
that you've got
actionable evidence

19:17.243 --> 19:19.201
of Kent Crawford's involvement?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.116
Probable cause?Not yet.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.379
That's why
we're going to talk to him.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.166
I don't know, Raymond.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.255
This doesn't seem right.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.953
Says the guy who's been stalking
Crawford for the last week.

19:31.996 --> 19:32.867
I haven't broken any laws.

19:32.878 --> 19:34.216
Okay.
Okay.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.131
And you still won't, Dwayne.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.003
Yeah. My guys are the ones
getting their hands dirty.

19:39.047 --> 19:40.222
You should come along.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.268
See how the big boys play.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.317
All right, now,
you all know Pierce Evans

19:48.361 --> 19:50.014
and all the trouble he's had.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.365
Well, the NCIS here,
they need to talk to him.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.671
But he's proving
really hard to find.

19:54.715 --> 19:57.152
Now, Agent Gregorio
and a few folks,

19:57.196 --> 19:58.893
they're sweeping
the edge of town,

19:58.936 --> 20:01.374
and Agent Lasalle and me,
we could use your help here.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.245
I don't like this.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.638
I mean,
Pierce has already shot at us.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.553
Well,
as a small-town police force,

20:06.596 --> 20:08.642
I depend on the help
of my neighbors.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.339
Plus, we already know
our way around the places

20:10.383 --> 20:12.036
that Pierce would want to hide.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.169
All right.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.563
Well, if y'all spot him,

20:16.606 --> 20:17.564
stay away.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.261
Contact Gregorio and I.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.002
We'll bring him in safely.

20:21.045 --> 20:22.264
All right, you heard the man.

20:22.308 --> 20:24.701
Do not make contact
with Pierce.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.573
You got your cell phones
and your panic whistles.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.053
Use 'em if you have to.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.274
It's kind of strange, huh?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.449
What is?

20:33.493 --> 20:35.059
Well, everybody's...

20:35.103 --> 20:37.061
driving brand spanking
new vehicles.

20:37.105 --> 20:38.367
Kind of sticks out

20:38.411 --> 20:39.803
in a place like this.Hmm.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.675
Sign of the times. Bovis
is on its way back.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.200
Everybody's got a
few dollars again.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.507
Let's go.Okay.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.295
It's coming from behind the bar.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.342
What is it, Larry?The car's right here.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.648
Pierce is inside.All right, call
Conroy. Let's go.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.696
Car's right here.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.524
All right. Stay right here.

21:07.396 --> 21:10.007
Brown Honda.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.879
Petty Officer Wilson's car.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.230
Pierce Evans!

21:15.274 --> 21:17.276
Hands where I can see 'em.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.297
Get it, get it, get it.Hey! Okay, I got it.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.821
All right, girls, come
on. Dinner's ready.Okay, Mom.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.084
So, what's the plan?

21:43.127 --> 21:45.565
Crawford's security shift
ended 30 minutes ago.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.784
Should be home soon.

21:47.828 --> 21:50.831
You gonna question him
in front of his wife and kids?

21:50.874 --> 21:53.268
They won't even
know we were here.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.661
Meaning?

21:54.704 --> 21:56.053
Crawford's car
just turned the block.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.359
All right.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.056
Operation's a go.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.362
Copy that.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.190
All right.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.626
I'll take the lead.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.889
Oh, stand down,
Special Agent.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.326
Let 'em do what they do, Dwayne.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.550
Get out! I said out!

22:14.594 --> 22:16.335
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't shoot.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.945
Don't shoot-- what--
no, wait, no...

22:17.988 --> 22:19.381
No, no!
Come on!

22:22.950 --> 22:25.169
Go, go!

22:28.434 --> 22:29.739
Abducted him
right off the street.

22:29.783 --> 22:31.132
They detained him, Dwayne.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.177
Couple months ago,
I was in his position.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.571
It didn't feel
like I was being detained.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.965
Yeah, but this is different.How?

22:38.008 --> 22:39.793
We're the good guys.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.243
Scrambled eggs,

22:55.286 --> 22:59.073
country baked ham,
and creamy cheese grits.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.466
Reminds me of my mama's
home cooking.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.598
Reminds me to check
my cholesterol.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.860
You eat like this every day?

23:03.904 --> 23:07.647
Only the days that end in "Y."

23:07.690 --> 23:09.649
Dig in and leave some room
for breakfast buns.

23:09.692 --> 23:10.693
Thank you.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.480
Mmm.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.310
What? It looks good.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.791
I thought you said
small towns make you nervous.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.011
No, no, no. I never said
anything about the food.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.492
Am I the only one who lost sleep

23:26.535 --> 23:29.669
over the sudden death
of our primary murder suspect?

23:29.712 --> 23:32.628
Yeah, it kept me up, too.
Something just don't feel right.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.282
Pierce Evans is a meth addict.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.936
Overdoses come
with the territory.

23:35.979 --> 23:37.633
If that's in fact what happened.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.156
I got some good news

23:39.200 --> 23:40.723
for you all.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.857
County coroner
just confirmed that

23:43.900 --> 23:46.076
Pierce Evans died of an acute

23:46.120 --> 23:48.122
methamphetamine overdose.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.603
A man's dead.
There's nothing good about that.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.344
Well, yeah, I just meant
that the, the case is closed

23:53.388 --> 23:55.564
and Dana Wilson got her justice.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.698
We're gonna need to see
that autopsy report.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.613
You bet. I'll have
a copy sent directly

24:00.656 --> 24:02.745
down to NCIS office
in New Orleans.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.140
Oh, god-dog it,
look at that.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.794
Skeeter Johnson got stuck
in his attic again.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.273
That's the third time
this month.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.145
Well, I better run.
I got to help him.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.756
Now, listen, y'all have a safe
drive back to New Orleans.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.236
Thank you.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.415
He seems eager to get rid of us.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.244
Yeah, question is why.

24:23.287 --> 24:25.551
I suspect the answer may lie
with the late Pierce Evans.

24:25.594 --> 24:27.988
I'm gonna go to the
county coroner's office,

24:28.031 --> 24:30.251
do that exam myself.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.948
What? You don't
have jurisdiction.

24:31.992 --> 24:36.387
Have a little faith.
I can be very persuasive.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.606
Stop lying

24:37.650 --> 24:39.956
to me.
I'm not.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.654
This isn't right.

24:41.697 --> 24:43.569
This is Kirby's
show right now.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.309
Yeah, and he's
screwing it up.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.834
Leaving Crawford in that room
all night, playing power games.

24:47.877 --> 24:50.793
Ethically,
it's on the line.

24:50.837 --> 24:53.622
It's way over the line,
Raymond, and you know it.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.755
Crawford's not gonna
give us anything this way,

24:55.798 --> 24:57.365
and if he does,
it'll be a lie.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.019
Not what you want to do!

25:01.935 --> 25:03.632
You got to give it
to this guy.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.373
He is tougher
than he looks, but...

25:05.416 --> 25:07.331
but I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.378
Whatever you got in this case,
you're not gonna use it.

25:10.421 --> 25:13.424
I'm gonna do what I have to.No.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.210
You're not gonna touch
Kent Crawford again.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.864
This man's a scumbag.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.083
He's an enemy combatant
with vital intel.

25:20.127 --> 25:22.390
He's also a husband
and a father.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.174
We should buy him
breakfast then.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.917
Actually, yes.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.877
What are you suggesting?

25:30.920 --> 25:33.270
Not all pressure points
are physical.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.755
Let's see what you got, Dwayne.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.018
I'm gonna need your help.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.199
Hey, hey.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.680
No, easy, easy. Easy.

25:51.724 --> 25:52.986
Hey.

25:53.029 --> 25:55.902
Come on, got
you a blanket.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.861
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah. Chair.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.777
Some water.

26:03.344 --> 26:05.868
Here's some water.

26:09.176 --> 26:12.266
Food's coming.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.486
Doesn't matter.
I know how this ends.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.488
I'm gonna die here.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.273
Nobody is dying.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.840
What, you're just
gonna take me home?

26:20.883 --> 26:23.016
That's not up to me.
It's up to my boss.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.887
Why am I talking to you, then?

26:24.931 --> 26:28.499
Because I'm the one
who understands

26:28.543 --> 26:30.545
why you're so afraid
of Avery Walker.

26:33.069 --> 26:37.073
Apollyon came after me
and my family.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.379
I got lucky.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.122
My father didn't.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.298
You're worried about

26:44.341 --> 26:47.083
what they might do
to your wife and children.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.172
They're innocent.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.566
That doesn't matter
to Walker.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.308
You're a loose end
to Apollyon,

26:54.351 --> 26:56.789
whether you cooperate
here with us or not.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.399
We got a team watching
your family.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.358
You work with us, we'll bring
'em in, keep 'em safe.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.752
I mean, there is nothing
that you could do

27:03.796 --> 27:05.536
to keep him
from coming after us.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.190
There is if we get to him first.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.632
Hey, hey. Look at me.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.681
I'm still breathing.
You're still breathing.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.989
Let's keep it that way.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.730
Let's take 'em down.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.649
We know that you smuggled
Walker out of prison.

27:30.692 --> 27:31.998
Where'd you take him?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.478
There's a private
airstrip in Ansley.

27:34.522 --> 27:36.176
There was a jet waiting.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.351
Going where?

27:37.394 --> 27:39.179
Don't know. He wouldn't
tell me, but, um,

27:39.222 --> 27:43.531
the pilot spoke French. He said
something about "Cointrin."

27:47.230 --> 27:50.190
Former name
of the Geneva Airport

27:50.233 --> 27:53.323
and a perfect place
for Walker to hide out.

27:56.022 --> 27:58.067
It turns out,
the county coroner and myself

27:58.111 --> 28:00.722
have the same affinity
for Left Bank Bordeaux,

28:00.766 --> 28:04.378
so I promised him a bottle
of '87 Château Haut-Brion

28:04.421 --> 28:06.423
in exchange for an hour
in his lab.

28:06.467 --> 28:09.731
Never underestimate the power
of a good bottle of wine.

28:09.775 --> 28:13.082
Now, based on my examination
of Pierce Evans,

28:13.126 --> 28:14.780
I concur with the C.O.D.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.607
It was a meth overdose?Yes.

28:16.651 --> 28:18.218
But it wasn't an accident.

28:18.261 --> 28:21.569
I found a series of sterile
abscesses where unabsorbed meth

28:21.612 --> 28:24.093
pooled beneath the skin.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.617
That happens when the needle
misses the vein.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.707
But in this case,

28:28.750 --> 28:31.971
someone forcibly injected
methamphetamine directly

28:32.014 --> 28:33.624
into his pulmonary vein.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.496
His heart could have
short-circuited.

28:35.539 --> 28:38.194
Yeah, wish I could say
he didn't suffer,

28:38.238 --> 28:39.587
but I'm certain he did.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.458
Sleepy town isn't
so sleepy anymore, huh?

28:41.502 --> 28:42.721
Yeah.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.897
Have a safe drive home.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.942
All right, so I did
a trace analysis

28:46.986 --> 28:49.075
of the substance that we found
near Dana Wilson's body.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.076
Okay.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.468
Found five
distinct compounds.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.732
Cellulose fiber,
dried whey,

28:53.775 --> 28:55.690
copper sulfate, anchovies,
and chicken liver.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.474
This sounds like a twisted
science experiment.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.215
It's actually dog food.

28:59.259 --> 29:00.564
It's a proprietary
blend.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.523
Petty Officer Wilson's aunt
didn't have a dog.

29:02.566 --> 29:05.134
No, but the Bovis dog food plant
is back in operation.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.136
Someone connected to that
could be our suspect.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.530
They could've tracked the
substance into the crime scene.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.488
I'll call Lasalle
and Gregorio.

29:11.532 --> 29:14.317
Contact at Swiss Intelligence
confirmed Walker

29:14.361 --> 29:16.493
at the Geneva Airport
three months ago.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.452
Could be anywhere by now.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.759
Yeah. It's as fresh a lead
as we're gonna get,

29:20.802 --> 29:22.456
and that means we're
headed to Switzerland.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.936
What about Crawford
and his family?

29:23.979 --> 29:26.590
Handed 'em over to WITSEC.
They'll be safe.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.679
Only if we catch Walker.

29:28.723 --> 29:32.031
You just said "we."
That mean you're signing up?

29:32.074 --> 29:34.685
Geneva's only
the first stop.

29:34.729 --> 29:37.819
No telling where
this chase might lead.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.822
Someone's got to keep
an eye on Kirby.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.519
And take down the most
dangerous criminal

29:42.563 --> 29:43.869
you ever faced.
Yeah.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.567
There's more, Dwayne.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.091
All ties to family and friends,
they must be cut.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.964
They can't know where you are
or what you're doing.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.661
Only way to keep 'em safe.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.097
You ready for that?

29:55.141 --> 29:57.534
How long do I have to decide?

29:57.578 --> 30:00.015
We'll leave in the morning.

30:06.413 --> 30:08.023
I know people go crazy

30:08.067 --> 30:10.373
for their pets, but automatic
weapons at a dog food factory?

30:10.417 --> 30:13.115
Yeah, we need to get

30:13.159 --> 30:15.422
a closer look and see what
they're really protecting.Right.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.163
Let's call Hannah
and get a warrant.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.644
No signal.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.081
Me neither.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.561
All right, let's
get a closer look.

30:40.403 --> 30:43.929
They're not making dog food,
they're cooking meth.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.715
Told you small towns
are creepy.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.903
I wish you could come,
too, Laurel.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.514
I know how much
you love to travel.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.474
Well, I'll call you
as-as often as I can,

31:07.517 --> 31:08.779
but, you know,

31:08.823 --> 31:11.608
with schedules
and-and security protocols...

31:11.652 --> 31:15.699
I'm gonna be
the global liaison to

31:15.743 --> 31:18.746
over a dozen regional
supervisors around the world.

31:18.789 --> 31:19.965
L-London,

31:20.008 --> 31:22.358
Naples, uh, Crete.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.925
I-I just didn't
want you to worry

31:23.969 --> 31:25.535
if you didn't hear
from me, that's all.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.146
Yeah.
Hey, Laurel,

31:27.189 --> 31:28.625
can I call you back?

31:29.800 --> 31:31.541
Love you, too, sweetie.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.979
Sorry, Pride, I was
trying not to listen.

31:34.022 --> 31:34.980
It's okay.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.112
It's okay.
Well, I guess

31:37.156 --> 31:39.636
a congratulations is in order.
I-I didn't, I didn't know

31:39.680 --> 31:41.203
that NCIS had
a global liaison.

31:43.727 --> 31:44.946
Hannah.

31:44.990 --> 31:48.210
No worries. No questions.
I've been there.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.256
Appreciate that.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.257
Doesn't mean I won't share
my opinion.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.869
Look, whatever it is
they've asked you to do,

31:54.913 --> 31:58.046
no matter
how important it may be,

31:58.090 --> 32:00.962
lying to your loved ones,
it doesn't get any easier.

32:01.006 --> 32:04.139
That guilt you feel,
it just grows.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.185
Trust me.

32:06.228 --> 32:09.188
Financials on this
Bovis dog food plant

32:09.231 --> 32:11.146
are all wrong.

32:11.190 --> 32:14.715
Uh, sales figures from the last
eight months are arbitrary

32:14.758 --> 32:17.196
and completely hide the fact
that they only had one customer.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.198
Well, it looks like all the
transactions were completed

32:19.241 --> 32:21.635
electronically through
the same numbered account.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.028
Yeah, the bank was offshore

32:23.071 --> 32:25.639
and the account holder
was completely anonymous.

32:25.682 --> 32:26.727
Well, if they're covering
something up,

32:26.770 --> 32:28.250
we need to find out what it is.

32:28.294 --> 32:30.557
Plus, I can't get through
to Lasalle or Gregorio.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.254
I'm starting to get worried.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.908
If you leave now,
the two of you can make it

32:33.952 --> 32:35.431
to Bovis within the hour.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.433
Wait, you're not coming?

32:37.477 --> 32:41.220
Pride will coordinate from here,
in case things go bad.

32:41.263 --> 32:43.787
Oh, that's smart,
'cause they usually do. Okay.

32:47.356 --> 32:48.618
Khoury.

32:51.273 --> 32:53.014
Be careful out there.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.321

33:36.666 --> 33:38.581
Got the lawyer

Couple signatures and 50% of
the Trutone is gonna be yours.

33:43.543 --> 33:44.761
What's going on with you?

33:44.805 --> 33:46.285
I'm just doing right
by my brother.

33:46.328 --> 33:47.721
Then why do you seem sad?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.593
Going away for a while.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.552
Need you to look
after the place.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.293
Laurel, too.

33:54.336 --> 33:56.164
Can you do that?Yeah, of course.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.600
Where you going?

33:57.644 --> 33:59.994
Finish something that never
should've got started.

34:04.825 --> 34:06.305
What's up, Sebastian?

34:06.348 --> 34:07.784
So I just talked to my guy

34:07.828 --> 34:09.264
at the Financial Action
Task Force,

34:09.308 --> 34:11.049
and it turns out
that they're tracking

34:11.092 --> 34:12.353
the same numbered account

34:12.398 --> 34:13.790
that's connected
to the dog food factory.

34:13.833 --> 34:14.835
Can you I.D.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.097
the account holder?

34:16.141 --> 34:17.228
Yeah,
it's a Mexican shell company,

34:17.272 --> 34:19.753
it's controlled
by the Sinaloa Cartel.

34:19.795 --> 34:21.275
Pride?

34:21.320 --> 34:22.973
Sebastian?

34:23.016 --> 34:24.975
Pride, hello?

34:25.018 --> 34:26.281
Call dropped.

♪ Hey...

34:30.416 --> 34:32.199
Apologies, Miss Julie, but
we need to use your pay phone.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.766
Cell phones aren't working.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.246
Oh, come on in.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.771
The towers must be out.

34:37.813 --> 34:39.512
I'll brew up a fresh pot.

34:39.554 --> 34:41.034
All right. Thank you.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.688
Crap.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.952
What's wrong?You got any change?

34:44.995 --> 34:46.257
Who carries change anymore?

34:46.301 --> 34:48.476
Well, we're gonna need some.Miss Julie!

34:48.521 --> 34:51.132
Um, can we please
borrow some quarters?

34:53.699 --> 34:54.962
Best to hang up.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.007
You heard my sister.

34:57.051 --> 34:58.531
I don't know
what you think we're doing,

34:58.574 --> 35:00.881
but there's really bad things
going on here in Bovis.

35:00.924 --> 35:01.969
You found the meth factory.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.884
We got you
on our security cameras.

35:03.927 --> 35:05.668
You guys are in on it?

35:05.712 --> 35:07.453
Why?Self-preservation.

35:07.496 --> 35:10.630
Our town was dying.

35:10.673 --> 35:12.414
And you decided
to save it with meth?

35:12.458 --> 35:14.373
We have all paid a price
to that drug.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.418
Lost people close to us.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.768
Was an opportunity to turn
a blight into a blessing.

35:18.812 --> 35:20.466
By going into the drug business?

35:20.509 --> 35:21.989
Well, we had to get back
what we lost.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.557
Everybody wins.Not Dana Wilson.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.255
Shut up. Shut up. Okay?

35:27.299 --> 35:29.736
Julie, give me the shotgun,
and bring the truck around.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.955
Larry, I don't like this.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.783
You shouldn't.
We're federal agents,

35:33.827 --> 35:35.263
and there's more of us coming.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.612
Larry?
Julie,

35:36.656 --> 35:39.572
give me the damn gun
and go get the truck.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.058
Strange place to find
the Sinaloa Cartel.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.409
Yeah, something tells me
the world's most powerful

35:50.452 --> 35:52.846
drug cartel isn't funneling
its money into Bovis

35:52.889 --> 35:54.326
just for its puppy chow.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.979
Agreed.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.550
How fast were you going?

36:01.594 --> 36:02.899
I...

36:07.730 --> 36:08.992
Howdy, folks.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.211
Uh, Special Agent

36:10.255 --> 36:12.082
Hannah Khoury and Lund here.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.345
Oh, I know who you are.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.390
Your companions told me
you were coming.

36:15.434 --> 36:17.436
If you like,
I can take you to 'em.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.307
Yeah, are they all right?Oh, they're fine,
they're just down

36:19.351 --> 36:20.787
at our dog food factory
having a look around,

36:20.830 --> 36:22.267
seeing if there's
something strange going on.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.225
I was just taking 'em some,
uh, biscuits and coffee.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.141
Aw, man, that sounds great.Well, there's plenty
for everybody.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.230
If you'd like to follow
me, I'll take you to 'em.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.492
Yeah, sure.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.364
All righty.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.714
He seems weirdly nice.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.324
Yeah, right?

36:36.368 --> 36:39.153
Business must be booming to keep
this place open 24/7, huh?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.982
Yeah, we can't fill
the orders fast enough,

36:42.025 --> 36:45.246
but I like to say, uh, never
look a gift horse in the mouth.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.682
Where are our colleagues?

36:46.726 --> 36:47.814
Oh, they're right in here.SEBASTIAN:
That's weird.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.251
This dog food expired
two years ago.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.688
You said our friends
found something strange?

36:52.732 --> 36:55.996
Yeah, well, they got some crazy
notion that we're up to no good.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.085
We're gonna need Special Agent
Lasalle and Gregorio right now.

36:58.128 --> 37:02.350
Well, now, that sounds like
you're giving me an order.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.830
Sorry to disappoint you.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.875
Sebastian. Disarm him.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.097
Uh, Hannah?

37:12.969 --> 37:15.494
I don't think we're getting
those biscuits.

37:26.113 --> 37:29.290
This is crazy.
What are we doing?

37:29.334 --> 37:31.292
Protecting our future,
that's what we're doing.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.294
By kidnapping
four federal agents?

37:33.338 --> 37:34.904
Nobody's ever gonna find out.

37:34.948 --> 37:38.125
If four NCIS agents go missing,
people are gonna start looking.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.345
Yeah, streets will be swarming
with law enforcement by morning.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.347
Let us go, we'll make sure
you get treated fairly.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.349
Especially if you cooperate.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.481
Now don't you get stupid on me.

37:46.525 --> 37:49.310
What do you think our business
partners are gonna do to you?

37:49.354 --> 37:52.705
You think they're gonna let you
live if you help the Feds?

37:52.748 --> 37:55.142
Your business partners
ain't gonna like any of this.

37:55.185 --> 37:56.448
Well, that's why they're sending
somebody up here right now

37:56.491 --> 37:57.666
to help clean up this mess.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.320
And by the time
they leave,

37:59.364 --> 38:00.713
there ain't gonna be no trace
of y'all.

38:00.756 --> 38:01.714
Yeah, after they're finished,
there ain't gonna be

38:01.757 --> 38:02.889
no trace of Bovis either.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.325
Charlie, what's she mean?

38:04.369 --> 38:06.501
You ever heard of Las Ochas?

38:06.545 --> 38:09.983
Beautiful fishing village
on the Gulf near Mazatlán.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.115
Fell on hard times.
Reached out

38:12.159 --> 38:14.030
to the Sinaloas
for help.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.032
Cartel used their boats
to smuggle cocaine

38:16.076 --> 38:17.295
into the United States

38:17.338 --> 38:18.948
until the DEA
found out.

38:18.992 --> 38:20.080
What happened?

38:20.123 --> 38:21.429
Oh, Sinaloas
took care of them, too.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.604
Sunk their boats.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.911
Burned down the village.

38:24.954 --> 38:27.130
Killed every villager
they could find.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.611
Three generations erased
in an afternoon.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.918
You made a deal
with the same devil.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.093
You expect the price
to be any different?

38:33.136 --> 38:34.921
What are we gonna do?

38:34.964 --> 38:37.489
You could, uh, p-put the
guns down and let us go.

38:37.532 --> 38:39.578
We'll protect you.They don't need no protection!

38:39.621 --> 38:40.840
I'm their protection!

38:40.883 --> 38:42.494
You're doing a
crap job of it.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.017
When this town
was dying,

38:44.060 --> 38:45.018
I fixed it.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.149
I gave 'em all jobs.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.237
I put money in your pockets.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.022
Gave you all
a future again.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.806
What about Dana Wilson
and Pierce Evans?

38:50.850 --> 38:52.504
Who else is gonna die?

38:52.547 --> 38:53.505
It's over.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.028
We can't anymore.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.203
Larry, untie 'em.

38:56.246 --> 38:57.552
Don't you touch them, Larry!

38:57.596 --> 38:59.337
Untie 'em!Don't you do it, Larry.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.252
Larry, no!

39:05.212 --> 39:07.432
Wait! Nobody shoot!

39:07.475 --> 39:08.650
This is
my damn town.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.173
We should've never listened
to you.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.045
We have disgraced
everything

39:12.088 --> 39:13.873
we was trying to save.

39:13.916 --> 39:15.570
Hey, Conroy. Look,
drop the gun, man.

39:16.702 --> 39:19.052
I will shoot you!

39:19.095 --> 39:21.097
You can go to hell.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.407
Come on!

39:26.451 --> 39:27.887
I got to find a phone.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.584
- Cut us loose.
- Come on, hurry.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.281
Call an ambulance.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.295
Where the hell are you?!
You said

39:45.339 --> 39:47.297
you'd be here! This whole
damn thing's gone sideways.

39:47.341 --> 39:50.039
I need you to help me!
Come on now!

39:50.083 --> 39:53.129
Come to me.
This is all falling apart!

39:53.173 --> 39:54.130
It's over.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.175
You can't do that!

39:55.218 --> 39:57.264
You need me!

40:15.674 --> 40:17.676
Appreciate it.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.462
Hey.Hey.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.856
Everybody okay?Yeah. Nothing three
or four hours

40:23.899 --> 40:25.597
at the spa won't fix.

40:25.640 --> 40:26.815
I mean, it was a little...

40:26.859 --> 40:28.034
close for comfort.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.818
Hey, thanks for sending
the cavalry, King.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.429
I'm sorry I wasn't here sooner.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.169
Any word on Conroy?

40:33.213 --> 40:35.563
Found his body outside of town.

40:35.607 --> 40:38.000
This story was never gonna
have a happy ending.

40:38.044 --> 40:41.221
Conroy was desperate
to make Bovis immortal.

40:41.264 --> 40:44.790
Instead, he managed to wipe 'em
off the map forever.

40:44.833 --> 40:48.054
All right, can we
go home, please?

41:00.240 --> 41:02.590
Wheels up in ten.
You almost didn't make it.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.247
You aren't coming, are you?

41:07.290 --> 41:10.293
My place is here, Raymond.

41:10.337 --> 41:14.210
No matter how bad I want Walker
and Apollyon brought to justice,

41:14.254 --> 41:16.865
I can't put that over
my family, my team.

41:16.909 --> 41:18.476
Not this time.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.739
They need you. I get it.

41:20.782 --> 41:22.828
Actually...

41:22.871 --> 41:25.831
I need them.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.790
Been through a lot
the last few months.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.750
Well, it's a loss.

41:31.793 --> 41:33.882
Not gonna lie.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.405
I understand.

41:35.449 --> 41:38.234
I appreciate that.

41:38.278 --> 41:40.759
Do me a favor,
would you?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.412
Keep an eye on
your man Kirby.

41:42.456 --> 41:43.675
You're a
federal agent,

41:43.718 --> 41:46.242
not an executioner.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.157
Don't forget that.

41:48.201 --> 41:51.160
Keep an eye on
yourself, too.

41:51.204 --> 41:53.946
Listen, Dwayne,
you can still be valuable.

41:53.989 --> 41:56.731
Be our contact here,
advise us if something happens.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.167
It won't.

41:58.211 --> 41:59.386
Right, but if it does,

41:59.429 --> 42:01.344
you're it.

42:01.388 --> 42:03.390
I've given you access
to the intel.

42:03.433 --> 42:05.523
The only other person
who has it.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.612
The only one
who can stop Apollyon.

42:13.008 --> 42:15.533
Take care of
yourself, Raymond.
