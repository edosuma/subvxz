01:02.333 --> 01:05.666

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
and I'm happy to be your host, Lando.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.625
Now, here in the hot seat with us today,

01:12.625 --> 01:14.833
we have Donkey Mangu.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.583
Mangu, you are one question away

01:17.583 --> 01:19.333
from winning a million dollars.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.458
(audience applauds)

01:20.458 --> 01:22.833
Everyone is on the edge of their seat.

01:22.833 --> 01:27.000
So how are you handling the pressure, eh?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.125

01:28.125 --> 01:30.833
Mangu, Mangu?

01:31.083 --> 01:32.375
Earth to Mangu.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.416
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

01:34.416 --> 01:36.708
What's that?
- Hey, are you still with us?

01:36.708 --> 01:37.541
- Yeah.

01:37.541 --> 01:39.541
- How are you feeling right about now?

01:39.541 --> 01:44.166
- Oh, Lando, I am so happy, I'm so happy,

01:44.166 --> 01:46.500
I don't even know what to say.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.625
In my whole life,

01:47.625 --> 01:49.833
I never would have thought
I would be sitting here

01:49.833 --> 01:53.375
in front of you on "I
Want to be a Millionaire."

01:53.375 --> 01:55.583
Ever since I was a little donkey,

01:55.583 --> 02:00.208
all I ever wanted was to appear
on your game show and win.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.708

02:04.541 --> 02:07.291

02:07.291 --> 02:10.958
- So cute, dare to dream,
my friend, dare to dream.

02:10.958 --> 02:13.916
You have just one question left.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.541
If you answer correctly,
you'll be a millionaire,

02:16.541 --> 02:21.541
and that question will be
coming up on your screen now.

02:21.708 --> 02:25.833
(dramatic orchestral music)

02:25.833 --> 02:28.208
- So dreaming your life away again, huh?

02:28.208 --> 02:30.875
Better wake up, you can't
just lay in bed and sleep.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.791
You gotta get up and face the world.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.000
- Is this is my Phone a Friend?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.291
- Hurry up, Mangu, you only
have 10 measly seconds left.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.291
- Better stop wasting your time, Mangu.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.083
You can't sleep all day, wake up, Donkey.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.458
Do you hear me, it's
past 7:30 in the morning.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.291
Are you gonna sleep all day?

02:46.291 --> 02:48.916
- I did it, I won, I'm so
happy, I'm a millionaire.

02:48.916 --> 02:53.416
I'm a millionaire, I bet
you're proud of me, huh?

02:53.416 --> 02:54.250
Hi, Uncle.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.458
- Don't sit there and "Hi" me, lazy bones.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.500
- Oh, dear Uncle Perry,

02:58.500 --> 03:02.833
you woke me up 10 seconds
before I became rich.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.833
I would have been the
first donkey millionaire

03:04.833 --> 03:07.583
in the history of Azad
City, I would have a big,

03:07.583 --> 03:09.750
beautiful house, a fiery sports car,

03:09.750 --> 03:13.916
and a girlfriend of my
very own, oh, a girlfriend.

03:37.958 --> 03:40.125
Stop the hugging, stop it.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.875
Listen, Mangu, when will you
stop living in a fantasy?

03:44.875 --> 03:47.958
- Oh, no, Uncle, my father said,

03:47.958 --> 03:50.666
"Anything is possible if you dream it.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.750
"Let your dreams shift your world."

03:52.750 --> 03:55.708
- You're so naive, that is
not how the world works.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.541
You come from a long line
of donkeys who died poor.

03:58.541 --> 04:00.708
The same will happen to
you, you can't change that.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.541
- Cut it out.

04:01.541 --> 04:02.875
- Your father, my brother, Changu,

04:02.875 --> 04:05.375
he was a dreamer and it didn't
do him any good, did it?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.333
- Uncle Perry.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.625
- It's about time for you
to join the real world.

04:08.625 --> 04:11.958
Get yourself to work and
start washing these clothes.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.041

04:13.041 --> 04:14.333

04:14.333 --> 04:15.666
- Of course it is,

04:15.666 --> 04:17.458
that's because today
is the Jungle Festival.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.291
All the clothes in Azad City
need to be washed today.

04:20.291 --> 04:23.125
Get going, forgot one, wait just a sec.

04:23.125 --> 04:24.583
You better be very careful with this,

04:24.583 --> 04:26.750
it is incredibly special,
it's the royal robe

04:26.750 --> 04:28.791

I'm afraid Uncle Perry is right.

- Of course not, you're
dreaming, which is good.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.291
- But Uncle Perry says
I have to stop dreaming

06:02.291 --> 06:04.791
because it won't lead to anything good.

06:04.791 --> 06:06.583

06:06.583 --> 06:09.791
about what you want,
you can make it happen.

family of donkeys. (brays)

good donkey can do anything,

06:21.916 --> 06:24.583
but you must first trust in yourself.

Only then do you have the opportunity

to reach your full potential,
got it, I'm watching.

I'll be there in a minute.

Oh, no, how am I gonna explain this?

Not good, Mangu, the prince
is gonna chop your ears off,

06:45.333 --> 06:48.583

'cause they're full of protein.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.250
Please let me deliver his robe.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.625
I want to meet the prince.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.666
- I will take it.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.958
- No, I want to take it to him myself.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.166
I may never have another
golden opportunity

12:01.166 --> 12:04.583
to meet royalty. (brays)

12:06.083 --> 12:08.875
Please, please let me do it.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.500
- Okay, just once, just this once,

12:11.500 --> 12:12.958
you may deliver it, then go.

12:12.958 --> 12:15.541
(Mangu laughs)

12:18.041 --> 12:19.500
(slow orchestral music)

12:19.500 --> 12:23.416
- Wow, it reminds me of
nowhere I've ever been.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.333
Huh?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.458
Help, somebody, help!

12:32.458 --> 12:34.583
The prince is on the
floor, he's not moving,

12:34.583 --> 12:36.750
and I think something
terrible has happened!

12:36.750 --> 12:40.625
I swear I didn't do anything. (cries)

12:40.625 --> 12:43.958
- Chill out, I didn't fall, I'm fine.

12:43.958 --> 12:46.125
I'm just snapping a selfie, you donkey.

12:46.125 --> 12:49.125
- Oh, sorry, sorry, you're not dead.

12:50.208 --> 12:54.000
Yes, I see that now,
(laughs) I have your robe.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.750
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.041
Here we go, here we go, here we go,

12:57.041 --> 12:59.041
here we go, here we go,
here we go, your royal robe.

12:59.041 --> 13:01.166
- What, there's a huge hole in it.

13:01.166 --> 13:04.291
I've had animals shaved
for less than this.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.958
- Prince, if I may speak, the
robe is not ruined at all.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.500
In fact, from what I heard,
it's the newest fashion

13:10.500 --> 13:14.000
on the scene, it's the very
first air conditioned robe

13:14.000 --> 13:14.958
in the world.

13:14.958 --> 13:15.791
- What?

13:15.791 --> 13:17.791
- Anyone who is anyone has one.

13:17.791 --> 13:20.625
I wish I had one, look
what you can do with it.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.625
As you walk about, you can
wag your tail around all day

13:23.625 --> 13:25.208
and really strut your stuff.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.500
The ladies go crazy when they see it.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.416
- Really, the ladies love it?

13:29.416 --> 13:31.000
- Yeah, it drives them wild.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.500
- Wow, I'm so putting this on.

13:36.791 --> 13:39.291
Miss Fitna, hey, Miss Fitna?

13:39.291 --> 13:40.916
Where's my fox when I need here?

13:40.916 --> 13:42.583
Hey, Miss Fitna--

13:42.583 --> 13:45.291
- You know I'm never
ever far away from you.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.708
What can I do for you, my prince?

13:47.708 --> 13:49.625
- How do you think I look, Miss Fitna?

13:49.625 --> 13:50.833
I look amazing?

13:50.833 --> 13:52.750
- Wow, it's to die for.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.666
Check yourself in the mirror.

13:56.666 --> 14:00.000
- I look cool, I look
too good for this world.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.500
It's a curse, beauty is a curse,

14:02.500 --> 14:06.458
and it's mine to bear. (cries)

14:06.458 --> 14:09.333
But I do look good, so good.

14:09.333 --> 14:10.625
- I wonder if between them,

14:10.625 --> 14:15.125
they even have half a brain. (laughs)

14:16.625 --> 14:19.250
Good morning, your highness, am I busy?

14:19.250 --> 14:23.250
No, not at all, not too
busy for you, right now?

14:24.333 --> 14:26.500
Yes, sir, right away, hmm.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.833
- Attention, all rise and
pay homage to the king

14:33.833 --> 14:37.166
as he graces us with his royal presence.

14:39.583 --> 14:42.666
(slow fanfare music)

14:54.166 --> 14:56.208
- You may proceed.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.708
- Yes, Your Majesty,

14:57.708 --> 15:00.625
preparations for the Jungle
Festival are underway.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.041
We've spared no expense, my Lord,

15:03.041 --> 15:06.375
a royal photographer, a
decadent feast to enjoy,

15:06.375 --> 15:09.916
and we've hired your favorite
artist to sing for you.

15:09.916 --> 15:14.166
- Very good, very good,
everything must be perfect.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.541
Today's festival is important.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.833
I am going to make a royal announcement.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.458
- Announcement, my Lord?

15:24.458 --> 15:27.708
- Calm yourself, super guard, control.

15:27.708 --> 15:32.625
Everything will be revealed
at today's festival. (sighs)

15:32.625 --> 15:36.958
That is all.
(slow orchestral music)

15:39.791 --> 15:42.375
- My Lord, as usual I'm here for you.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.875
Whatever you wish, I will provide.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.416
- Of course you will, Fitna.

15:47.416 --> 15:50.416
I need your advice on a delicate matter.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.250
- You need my advice?

15:52.250 --> 15:53.375
- Fitna, more than anyone,

15:53.375 --> 15:56.750
you know how long I've
been sitting on the throne.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.250
But I don't feel I can continue my duties.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.500
My arthritis has gotten worse.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.416
I'm even having trouble
with my, don't ask.

16:05.416 --> 16:08.291
I believe it's now time for young Shazad

16:08.291 --> 16:11.375
to replace me and ascend to my throne.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.375
- You don't mean--

16:12.375 --> 16:15.708
- Ah, the announcement
I will make today is,

16:15.708 --> 16:19.125
from this day forward, the
prince shall take his place

16:19.125 --> 16:20.333
on the throne.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.791
- You mean Prince Shazad?

16:21.791 --> 16:23.458
- Yes, you agree?

16:23.458 --> 16:26.625
- Well, what an idea,
what a great idea, sir.

16:26.625 --> 16:29.250
- I will admit to you that
I do have some concerns.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.583
- Concern, what's your concern?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.541
- I know the prince is immature.

16:33.541 --> 16:37.750
He's always on Facebook, putting
up nonsense like selfies.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.458
That's why I'm not sure
he's ready for the throne.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.375
- Sadly, it's true, my Lord.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.041
The prince can be very immature,

16:45.041 --> 16:48.125
self absorbed, and rather simple minded.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.041
In fact, there's some who
would say he's no lion at all--

16:51.041 --> 16:51.875
- Who says that?

16:51.875 --> 16:54.750
- Well, I don't say that,
I don't say that at all.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.541
- Very good, very good.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.500
- I'm sure once the prince
is sitting comfortably

16:58.500 --> 16:59.500
on the throne,

16:59.500 --> 17:02.750
he'll become exactly the
king we all know he can be.

17:02.750 --> 17:03.625
- Really?

17:03.625 --> 17:05.416
- But of course, my King, of course.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.375
- Fitna, you can't deny one thing.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.291
The prince is not very
popular with the animals

17:09.291 --> 17:12.041
of this country, so I doubt
they would accept him.

17:12.041 --> 17:13.625
We can't expect to live peacefully

17:13.625 --> 17:15.208
if the animals are unhappy.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.291
- Animals, they'll do what we tell them.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.708
- No, Fitna, no way,
this country's love is

17:19.708 --> 17:23.458
what gives him strength, a
king must rule with his heart.

17:23.458 --> 17:27.083
Otherwise, his time on the
throne won't be very long.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.666
So the animals must love him.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.583
- There is a way, of course,

17:31.583 --> 17:34.041
but I don't think you're
gonna like it very much.

17:34.041 --> 17:34.875
- Fitna?

17:34.875 --> 17:36.333
- My Lord, what if we were

17:36.333 --> 17:40.166
to turn our great nation into a democracy

17:40.166 --> 17:43.000
and let the animals choose
the king themselves?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.583
- Democracy, what kind
of nonsense is that?

17:45.583 --> 17:48.083
- Only for public, just for show,

17:48.083 --> 17:52.625
but our democracy will in
reality be a hypocrisy.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.750
We control everything,
animals will think they voted

17:55.750 --> 17:59.500
for a king, but except
everything's been already fixed.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.708
As long as things go according
to plan, the prince wins.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.083
It's the same way humans choose

18:04.083 --> 18:06.250
their own king all over
the world, you see?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.500
- No, no way, I refuse to copy them.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.333
- Eh?

18:09.333 --> 18:14.083
- I refuse to sink my throne
to their level, we are done.

18:16.041 --> 18:21.041
Democracy, election, (scoffs)
what will they think of next?

18:24.000 --> 18:24.916
- Miss Fitna--

18:24.916 --> 18:25.875
- I didn't do it.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.958
Godzilla, where have you been?

18:27.958 --> 18:30.083
- In here, but hiding from
the king, he scares me.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.458
You have to admit it yourself,

18:31.458 --> 18:33.291
he scares you as well, right?

18:33.291 --> 18:37.208
You don't want to have
your pretty head cut off.

18:37.208 --> 18:41.833
- Scared, (laughs) far
from it, you scaly fool.

18:41.833 --> 18:44.958
Yes, lions and elephants
are stronger than I,

18:44.958 --> 18:49.333
but the last time you went to
a circus, did you see a fox?

18:49.333 --> 18:53.125
Go on, have you ever seen
a fox dance in a circus?

18:53.125 --> 18:54.833
- Madame, I only go to the circus

18:54.833 --> 18:57.041
because I want to see the clowns.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.625
Oh, I forgot, I also have a sweet tooth,

18:58.625 --> 19:00.333
so I always get the cotton candy.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.958
- You talk such foolish
nonsense, you coward.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.208
I have a plan, where's Jambora?

19:05.208 --> 19:06.750
He's the one I need.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.333
- You know how Jambora is.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.875
He's either out there putting
on a show, or he's dead.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.166
- I don't care what he's doing.

19:12.166 --> 19:16.666
I got a show he's gonna love. (scats)

23:12.833 --> 23:16.333
(upbeat orchestral music)

23:29.083 --> 23:31.916
(audience cheers)

23:32.833 --> 23:34.875
(dramatic orchestral music)

23:34.875 --> 23:37.708
(Mangu cries out)

23:40.833 --> 23:45.833
(audience cheers)
(upbeat orchestral music)

23:47.125 --> 23:50.041
- Mangu, use this to hypnotize him.

23:52.625 --> 23:55.791
(slow Carnatic music)

24:06.875 --> 24:10.541
(dramatic orchestral music)

24:14.125 --> 24:16.875
(Tsunami snorts)

24:20.875 --> 24:22.000
(audience cheers)

24:22.000 --> 24:23.375
(Tsunami farts)

24:23.375 --> 24:24.708
- He beat him?

24:24.708 --> 24:28.041
We'd better go before he comes after us.

24:29.208 --> 24:32.666
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Mangu beat Tsunami.

24:32.666 --> 24:36.375
He was the one person brave
enough to take on the bull.

24:36.375 --> 24:40.041
And now His Majesty, King
Khan, has an announcement.

24:40.041 --> 24:43.375
(slow orchestral music)

24:45.416 --> 24:47.833
- Hear me, one and all.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.833
Although I have spent
my whole life carrying

24:50.833 --> 24:53.750
and watching over your little lives,

24:53.750 --> 24:56.458
all good things must come to an end.

24:56.458 --> 24:59.750
And so I hereby announce my departure,

24:59.750 --> 25:02.375
and I shall step down as your king.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.833
But a new king will rise.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.708
- [Audience] What, a new king?

25:05.708 --> 25:07.208
- Yes, a new king,

25:08.791 --> 25:10.666
a king who is younger.

25:10.666 --> 25:13.125
After much consideration, I have come

25:13.125 --> 25:17.125
to an inescapable conclusion, that yes,

25:17.125 --> 25:21.291
my young son you know as Prince
Shazad is the best choice

25:21.291 --> 25:23.875
to take my place on the throne.

25:27.041 --> 25:31.208
- The prince, he's a spoiled
brat who cares for nobody.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.458
How will he make a good king?

25:33.458 --> 25:35.541
- I hear that your prince is a lazy bum.

25:35.541 --> 25:38.416
I think we should just
reject him, how about you?

25:38.416 --> 25:41.291
- You're right, no, we
can't accept him as king,

25:41.291 --> 25:43.708
not the prince, unacceptable.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.833
(overlapping chattering)

25:46.833 --> 25:48.708
- [Audience Members] Unacceptable.

25:48.708 --> 25:52.125
(overlapping chattering)

25:55.583 --> 25:59.041
- My Lord, the people
are not happy, not happy.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.541
(Khan growls)

26:03.666 --> 26:06.625
- My King, my King, if
you lose your temper now,

26:06.625 --> 26:08.833
things could get very ugly.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.250
Remember my proposal to hold elections?

26:11.250 --> 26:12.791
That's the way we get what we want

26:12.791 --> 26:14.041
and keep the animals happy.

26:14.041 --> 26:18.583
- Quiet!
(slow orchestral music)

26:18.583 --> 26:21.000
I have not finished my announcement.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.208
Shazad is my choice, but then
something occurred to me.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.750
Our nation needs something modern.

26:27.750 --> 26:31.458
You, the animals, should
have rule by democracy.

26:31.458 --> 26:36.208
You will vote, you shall select
your next king by decree.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.958
I'm told the humans
have a similar practice.

26:42.750 --> 26:46.208
Now, of all of you, who will step forward

26:46.208 --> 26:48.666
and run against the prince
for the democratic right

26:48.666 --> 26:51.083
to be your king, huh, anyone?

26:52.208 --> 26:53.958
- One moment, your Highness,

26:53.958 --> 26:57.291
how can anyone here possibly
compete with the prince?

26:57.291 --> 26:59.583
As you know, we are but common animals.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.333
- No, no, His Majesty has spoken.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.791
He says the animals will
choose their next king,

27:04.791 --> 27:07.291
and when His Majesty has made a decision,

27:07.291 --> 27:09.291
nothing in the world
could change it one bit.

27:09.291 --> 27:12.750
Isn't that right? (laughs)

27:12.750 --> 27:17.000
- Of course, of course,
and so it is now decided,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.666
leading the search to find someone

27:18.666 --> 27:22.416
to run against the prince
will be Fitna here.

27:22.416 --> 27:24.875
In exactly two weeks from today,

27:24.875 --> 27:26.458
we'll hold the first election

27:26.458 --> 27:29.541
in our nation's history, that is all.

27:34.708 --> 27:37.791
(upbeat poppy music)

27:48.083 --> 27:50.958
- Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to "Royal Idol,"

27:50.958 --> 27:52.958
the show where we search the entire nation

27:52.958 --> 27:56.083
for a reality TV star
to be the brand new king

27:56.083 --> 28:00.000
of Azadnagar, based on
a 30 second audition.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.375
- Why should you be our new king?

28:03.375 --> 28:06.625
- To be a good king, you
have to love the people,

28:06.625 --> 28:09.000
and I'm all about loving all the people,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.625
I really do, (laughs) all of them!

28:12.625 --> 28:16.333
- If you make me the king of
the United States of Azadnagar,

28:16.333 --> 28:19.291
I'll be the best king of
all time, the greatest.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.083
I will drain the swamp

28:21.083 --> 28:23.083
'cause nobody will do it better than me.

28:23.083 --> 28:26.250
And I get the ratings, TVs always love me.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.708
You know you love me.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.208
- This is a very simple matter.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.291
The next king should be a goat like me.

28:32.291 --> 28:34.791
- A true king has to be able
to move and have perfect pitch.

28:34.791 --> 28:36.125
We do, let's show them.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.916
- [Both] One, two, three, four.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.666
♪ Boom, we blow your mind,
boom, we blow your mind ♪

28:39.666 --> 28:41.208
♪ Boom, we blow your mind ♪

28:41.208 --> 28:44.875
♪ You can't handle our
beat, but you need it ♪

28:44.875 --> 28:48.333
♪ It was trapped in your
butts but we freed it ♪

28:48.333 --> 28:51.708
♪ If you make us the
king, we will see this ♪

28:51.708 --> 28:54.708
- The problem with this
country are the children.

28:54.708 --> 28:57.083
They are given too much freedom.

28:57.083 --> 29:00.583
If I am king, they will be
given much less freedom.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.833
- Hello, hello, you can stop the search.

29:02.833 --> 29:05.083
I am here, you will make me
the king, what's the holdup?

29:05.083 --> 29:08.791
I just know you won't let me
have it because I'm a woman.

29:08.791 --> 29:11.458
- Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, you know me from MNN.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.208
Today I would like to
break a major scandal

29:13.208 --> 29:15.958
and speak truth to power,
it pains me to say it,

29:15.958 --> 29:17.708
but the facts are quite clear.

29:17.708 --> 29:20.208
Corruption, it's everywhere,
including the king,

29:20.208 --> 29:22.083
who is robbing the country blind.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.958
I have to tell you this,
the truth can't be denied.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.333
The country needs a change,

29:26.333 --> 29:28.625
and I'm the change the
country needs, vote for me.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.291
- Audition, audition, audition, audition,

29:30.291 --> 29:32.833
audition, audition, that is my audition.

29:32.833 --> 29:35.625
It's an excellent audition,
what more do you fools want?

29:35.625 --> 29:39.000
♪ You can't handle our
beat but you need it ♪

29:39.000 --> 29:42.083
(upbeat poppy music)

29:49.875 --> 29:50.791
- Really, this is terrible.

29:50.791 --> 29:53.125
Watching these wannabes
is giving me a headache.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.583
Why does this have to be so hard?

29:54.583 --> 29:56.291
My hat would make a better king.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.541
The prince will run unopposed,

29:58.541 --> 30:01.458
and the king will be so
upset he'll have our heads.

30:01.458 --> 30:03.583
- No, no, we cannot give up.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.333
We really must have a
competitive election.

30:06.333 --> 30:09.000
We need someone to run against the prince,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.375
I don't care if it's a donkey.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.625
- What, donkey?

30:13.583 --> 30:17.833
Donkey, that's it, Jambora,
a donkey, what an idea.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.458
Quick, the washerman, what's his name?

30:20.458 --> 30:21.291
- Mangu?

30:21.291 --> 30:23.500
- Yes, that's it, go and bring him back.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.166
- But that donkey is such a--

30:25.166 --> 30:28.916
- I know he's a joke, but he's
a joke that belongs to us.

30:28.916 --> 30:31.083
He's exactly what we
need in this situation.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.250
He's someone who will do whatever we say.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.291
We'll come out of this
smelling like roses.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.875
"Royal Idol" has a winner.

30:36.875 --> 30:40.416
- "Royal Idol" audition
number 419, take one, action.

30:40.416 --> 30:42.125
- Hello out there, my name is Mangu,

30:42.125 --> 30:46.916
and I'll be the donkey king. (brays)

30:46.916 --> 30:47.750
(Mangu snorts)

30:47.750 --> 30:51.208
- Cut, cut, cut, you're
terrible, total disaster.

30:51.208 --> 30:53.000
No one in the world would vote for you.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.333
He belongs in the dumpster.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.666
- This wasn't my idea, anyway,
I'd make a rotten king.

30:57.666 --> 30:59.208
- Don't talk like that, Mangu.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.916
You're the perfect choice
to lead this country

31:00.916 --> 31:03.291
in a new direction, who
better than a donkey

31:03.291 --> 31:05.541
to bear the burden of leading our people?

31:05.541 --> 31:07.791
- Oh, no, Madame, I
couldn't possibly do that.

31:07.791 --> 31:10.125
- Silly Mangu, of course you can.

31:10.125 --> 31:12.458
Think of the endless possibilities.

31:12.458 --> 31:16.458
When you're king, you'll have
tons of money, a huge mansion,

31:16.458 --> 31:18.333
a beautiful girlfriend who will shower you

31:18.333 --> 31:21.250
with love and other things.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.583
- My dream girl?

31:24.416 --> 31:27.333
(slow poppy music)

31:29.416 --> 31:34.416
♪ You are my dream girl ♪

31:39.333 --> 31:42.666
♪ You are my dream girl ♪

31:44.208 --> 31:46.791
- Mangu, yoo hoo, Mangu, Mangu?

31:47.791 --> 31:48.916
- Yeah, I'm with you.

31:48.916 --> 31:49.916
- You have to realize

31:49.916 --> 31:52.750
you can have everything
you've ever wanted.

31:52.750 --> 31:53.583
- Everything?

31:53.583 --> 31:57.750
- Of course, come with me,
let me show you something.

31:57.750 --> 32:01.791
Come along, just look at this
palace, imagine living here.

32:01.791 --> 32:03.875
- Madame, the king has
stepped out for a moment,

32:03.875 --> 32:04.833
but he'll return.

32:04.833 --> 32:07.666
- That's quite all right,
just two minutes, please.

32:07.666 --> 32:10.125
Now, donkey, doesn't
this make you feel good?

32:10.125 --> 32:13.250
- Oh, Madame, just
being here terrifies me.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.666
- Good, the king will be here any moment.

32:15.666 --> 32:17.666
- No, Miss Fitna, I don't belong here.

32:17.666 --> 32:20.458
I am only a humble washerman donkey.

32:20.458 --> 32:23.000
- Mangu, being a donkey is not your fault,

32:23.000 --> 32:24.750
but acting like a little coward,

32:24.750 --> 32:27.125
you're the one who's making that choice,

32:27.125 --> 32:28.750
and it is a choice that is going to stay

32:28.750 --> 32:30.833
with you and haunt you your whole life.

32:30.833 --> 32:33.708
Are you sure that's what
you really want, Mangu?

32:33.708 --> 32:36.000
- Huh, me as the king, who is she kidding?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.166
What kind of idiot will follow a donkey?

32:38.166 --> 32:40.416
- Boy, get over here.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.375
- Again with the cane?

32:41.375 --> 32:42.541
- Why are you leaving?

32:42.541 --> 32:44.875
- Come on, Dad, I don't
belong in the palace.

32:44.875 --> 32:47.000
- If not here, then where
exactly do you think

32:47.000 --> 32:50.708
you would belong, my son,
washing clothes forever?

32:50.708 --> 32:53.375
This is your one chance
to do so much more.

32:53.375 --> 32:54.375
- What can I do?

32:54.375 --> 32:55.583
- You always have a choice.

32:55.583 --> 32:58.666
Some wait their whole lives
for an opportunity like this.

32:58.666 --> 33:00.166
I don't want you to fail to hear

33:00.166 --> 33:02.541
that doorbell, you gotta answer it.

33:02.541 --> 33:05.166
You may not get this
opportunity ever again.

33:05.166 --> 33:07.375
- So should I say yes?

33:07.375 --> 33:10.000
- You fool, have you
not heard a single word

33:10.000 --> 33:11.625
that I've said out here?

33:11.625 --> 33:14.791
Of course you're going to say yes, go.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.166
- Miss Fitna.

33:18.166 --> 33:20.708
(dramatic orchestral music)

33:20.708 --> 33:21.958
I've decided that I'm ready

33:21.958 --> 33:24.083
to carry the burden of the kingdom.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.166
(Fitna cheers)

33:25.166 --> 33:27.250
- I told you so, I told
you so, I told you so.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.083
- On one condition.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.916
(dramatic orchestral music)

33:29.916 --> 33:32.333
I will carry the burden of the kingdom,

33:32.333 --> 33:35.375
but I can't handle if it
weighs any more than 30 pounds.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.541
I have a bad back, here, you want to see?

33:37.541 --> 33:38.375
- No.

33:38.375 --> 33:39.458
- As you wish.

33:39.458 --> 33:42.416
- What a fool this donkey
is, that he actually thinks

33:42.416 --> 33:46.750
he could rule this kingdom
by himself. (laughs)

33:46.750 --> 33:49.416
(Shazad laughs)

33:52.666 --> 33:55.000
- Oh, Miss Fitna, Miss Fitna,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.833
say it again, just one more time. (laughs)

33:58.833 --> 34:00.041
- Prince Shazad, you will--

34:00.041 --> 34:03.916
(Shazad laughs hysterically)

34:03.916 --> 34:07.666
- I can't take it, I
can't take it. (laughs)

34:07.666 --> 34:09.625
- What's all this big laughing about?

34:09.625 --> 34:11.375
One simple question for you,

34:11.375 --> 34:13.875
have you been able to
find a candidate yet?

34:13.875 --> 34:18.666
- Dad, it's even better. (laughs)

34:18.666 --> 34:19.500
- Fitna?

34:19.500 --> 34:23.333
- Yes, sir, the opposition
candidate will be Mangu.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.000
- Oh, the donkey from the arena.

34:27.208 --> 34:31.500
- Dad, he does laundry. (laughs)

34:31.500 --> 34:34.250
- You see, you are certain to become king,

34:34.250 --> 34:37.083
to victory. (blows kisses)

34:37.083 --> 34:38.500
- Someone will have to be in charge

34:38.500 --> 34:39.916
of the prince's campaign,

34:39.916 --> 34:42.291
and that will be your job, Miss Fitna.

34:42.291 --> 34:44.583
- I'll take care of
everything, you just lay down

34:44.583 --> 34:46.291
and sleep through it all.

34:46.291 --> 34:49.625
- Yes, a nap is what I really need.

34:49.625 --> 34:52.416
(Khan groans)

34:52.416 --> 34:53.458
Oh, my arthritis.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.250
- Little does the king know yet,

34:55.250 --> 34:57.958
but when the credits roll
at the end of this film,

34:57.958 --> 35:01.208
I'll be the one sitting
on the throne. (laughs)

35:01.208 --> 35:03.083
- I'm so excited, I just can't hide it.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.875
I love this election, nothing
could stop the prince now

35:05.875 --> 35:09.583
from becoming king, it's
totally in the bag ski.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.250
- We will stop him, we'll
make the donkey king.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.250
- What, but I thought that, I'm confused.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.916
- Will you hack into the voting machines?

35:16.916 --> 35:19.125
- No, we don't need to do that.

35:19.125 --> 35:20.375
We'll use your news channel

35:20.375 --> 35:22.250
to make people think Mangu is a hero,

35:22.250 --> 35:25.041
and the prince is horrible.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.625
- I like the idea because a
foolish king is a great source

35:27.625 --> 35:29.208
of scandalous news.

35:29.208 --> 35:32.375
My ratings will likely go
completely through the roof.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.416
- And what if the king should
find out about your plans?

35:34.416 --> 35:38.958
- Watch, see that pocket,
keep your eye on the ball.

35:38.958 --> 35:40.416
(slow orchestral music)

35:40.416 --> 35:42.625
- Huh, you were aiming for this ball.

35:42.625 --> 35:44.791
I don't know how you did that, mind blown.

35:44.791 --> 35:46.375
- This is how we will control every aspect

35:46.375 --> 35:48.041
of the upcoming election, you see.

35:48.041 --> 35:50.416
I will accompany the
prince everywhere he goes.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.083
You two will follow Mangu,

35:52.083 --> 35:54.250
and everything he says
should sound brilliant.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.041
But every time the prince makes a mistake,

35:56.041 --> 35:58.333
you have to have a reporter on the scene,

35:58.333 --> 35:59.750
and that reporter will find a way

35:59.750 --> 36:02.041
to blow everything out of proportion.

36:02.041 --> 36:04.750
- I gotta say, your plan
is right up my alley.

36:04.750 --> 36:07.166
First we speak evil, then hear evil,

36:07.166 --> 36:09.958
and, of course, then show evil.

36:09.958 --> 36:13.208
(Godzilla scats)

36:13.208 --> 36:16.000
- I've always said lions
and elephants may be strong,

36:16.000 --> 36:20.083
but their real talent is to
perform like dogs in a circus.

36:20.083 --> 36:22.625
(Fitna laughs)

36:22.625 --> 36:27.333
(Fitna scats)
(Godzilla scats)

36:27.333 --> 36:29.500
- My friends and those
who are not my friends.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.583
As the song goes, "Times are changing,"

36:31.583 --> 36:33.666
and we must change with
those changing times,

36:33.666 --> 36:36.625
or the times will simply
change without us.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.250
Speaking of changing times, I
missed the bus this morning.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.541
And since we're having a
conversation about buses,

36:41.541 --> 36:43.625
you should all know I
prefer the yellow bus.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.583
And while we're on the subject of yellow,

36:45.583 --> 36:48.500
don't you agree with me that
yellow bees are very annoying

36:48.500 --> 36:50.291
in the summer, and in the summertime,

36:50.291 --> 36:52.625
there's nothing I love more
than going to the beach.

36:52.625 --> 36:55.416
Speaking of the beach in the
summertime, I cannot swim,

36:55.416 --> 36:58.500
so I just lie on the beach
and get all sandy. (laughs)

36:58.500 --> 37:00.083
- Cut, cut, cut.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.458
What in this nonsense
you're speaking, donkey?

37:02.458 --> 37:03.958
- You gave me specific instructions

37:03.958 --> 37:05.791
and you said, "Talk like a politician."

37:05.791 --> 37:08.250
- Mangu, my pea brained donkey friend,

37:08.250 --> 37:11.083
don't try to be a
politician, just be yourself.

37:11.083 --> 37:13.375
- I can't do this anymore, I'm out.

37:13.375 --> 37:16.125
- Godzilla, bring me that donkey.

37:17.541 --> 37:21.291
I said get the donkey,
go get me that donkey.

37:22.458 --> 37:26.208
(whimsical orchestral music)

37:27.291 --> 37:28.333
(group cries out)

37:28.333 --> 37:31.833
(lively orchestral music)

37:49.708 --> 37:54.250
- Just stop, calm down,
think happy thoughts.

37:54.250 --> 37:58.125
- Mangu, I have an idea,
we'll write your speeches,

37:58.125 --> 37:59.791
and I'm sure they'll be great.

37:59.791 --> 38:02.458
- Not only that, we'll manage
every aspect of your campaign.

38:02.458 --> 38:06.041
Don't worry, we'll take
care of everything.

38:15.208 --> 38:17.125
- Oh, I'm just thinking here,

38:17.125 --> 38:20.000
but if Mangu wins, things will change.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.708
He's a regular donkey,
not some stuck-up elitist.

38:23.708 --> 38:28.041
He's a laundry man, he
has no love for the 1%.

38:28.041 --> 38:32.458
The 1% can die, (chuckles) but
you didn't hear that from me,

38:32.458 --> 38:34.958
and if you did, no biggie.

38:34.958 --> 38:38.125
- Indeed, could that Mangu really win?

38:38.125 --> 38:40.208
The animals would all have a voice.

38:40.208 --> 38:42.875
Then we could really
turn this country around.

38:42.875 --> 38:44.958
I must spread the word.

38:44.958 --> 38:47.083
(dramatic orchestral music)

38:47.083 --> 38:49.166
(slow music)

38:49.166 --> 38:51.916
- My little jungle
animals, other nations like

38:51.916 --> 38:54.375
to send animals to the
moon, I'll send them

38:54.375 --> 38:56.875
to the sun because it's bigger.

38:56.875 --> 38:59.208
- Isn't the sun incredibly hot?

38:59.208 --> 39:02.208
- Well, of course it is, that's
why I'll send them at night

39:02.208 --> 39:05.750
and not during the daytime, genius.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.458
- My friends, if you make me king,

39:07.458 --> 39:10.541
I will protect the rights of all animals.

39:10.541 --> 39:13.208
I will even protect the
rights of humans because,

39:13.208 --> 39:17.416
let's face it, they have it
worse than we do, they do.

39:17.416 --> 39:18.541
- Don't waste time,

39:18.541 --> 39:20.166
you have to go out
there and make promises.

39:20.166 --> 39:21.291
- But then I'd have to keep them.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.250
- Election promises
are just like balloons.

39:23.250 --> 39:26.291
After the election, you
ignore them and they deflate.

39:26.291 --> 39:28.708
- No longer will we push carts, instead,

39:28.708 --> 39:30.208
we will all have brand new cars

39:30.208 --> 39:32.166
to drive. (imitates engine revving)

39:32.166 --> 39:33.416
Out of the way.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.208
- When I am king,

39:36.208 --> 39:38.916
fortunes will decline
while poverty thrives.

39:38.916 --> 39:41.583
- You mean fortunes will
thrive as poverty declines?

39:41.583 --> 39:43.625
- That's what I'm saying, you animals have

39:43.625 --> 39:46.083
to open up your ears and listen to me.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.041
Otherwise, how will poverty
ever be able to thrive?

39:49.041 --> 39:51.416
- Godzilla, have you ordered the food yet?

39:51.416 --> 39:52.250
- What for?

39:52.250 --> 39:54.541
- What for, let me explain it.

39:54.541 --> 39:57.833
People actually vote with
their bellies, their bellies.

39:57.833 --> 39:58.666
- When I am king,

39:58.666 --> 40:01.333
a new and vastly improved
country will emerge,

40:01.333 --> 40:04.000
and then we'll sell the old one.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.708
- Any comments?

40:06.708 --> 40:09.125
- Four words, I hate donkeys.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.666
- You heard it here, how do you respond

40:11.666 --> 40:13.208
to this insult, Mangu?

40:13.208 --> 40:17.291
- Inky pinky punky, I am
just a donkey. (brays)

40:17.291 --> 40:18.291
- You heard it here.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.500
- My friends, when I
am made king, I will--

40:20.500 --> 40:23.583
- Fitna, Fitna, Fitna, I see Mangu's face

40:23.583 --> 40:25.833
in every newspaper and all over TV.

40:25.833 --> 40:29.416
- Don't worry, elections
are very much like circuses.

40:29.416 --> 40:32.333
The clown is just there
to entertain the crowd.

40:32.333 --> 40:36.208
The show stopping final act
always belongs to the lion.

40:36.208 --> 40:37.041
- I'm glad.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.000
- When the two face off in the debate,

40:39.000 --> 40:42.458
Shazad will have that donkey
begging for mercy in no time.

40:42.458 --> 40:46.375
So relax, my king, and
enjoy the show, ta ta.

speech, tomorrow's election day.

42:46.666 --> 42:49.333
If you make any mistakes, we're dead.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.541
- Time to seal the deal, don't choke.

42:51.541 --> 42:53.375
There are hundreds of people out there.

42:53.375 --> 42:57.041
- Wait, wait, wait, Mr.
Jambora, please, I have some--

42:57.041 --> 42:59.958
- Hey, cut out the
whining, what do you fear?

42:59.958 --> 43:01.625
- Dad, I have to give a speech.

43:01.625 --> 43:03.250
There's hundreds of people out there.

43:03.250 --> 43:06.250
- That's it, just speak from
your heart, you'll be fine.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.375
- You said to speak from my heart?

43:07.375 --> 43:10.791
- Uh-huh, you got it, boy,
you see, when you speak

43:10.791 --> 43:13.666
from the heart, when you speak truth,

43:13.666 --> 43:16.041
then your words, they grow wings

43:16.041 --> 43:19.458
and fly into the hearts of your audience.

43:21.375 --> 43:24.666
- Fly into hearts, my words, grow wings?

43:24.666 --> 43:29.208
I could really go for some
buffalo wings right now.

43:29.208 --> 43:33.125
- Ladies and gentlemen,
predators and prey.

43:33.125 --> 43:38.125
I give you a donkey who
needs no introduction, Mangu.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.708
(audience applauds)
(slow orchestral music)

43:39.708 --> 43:42.708
- So many people, here goes nothing.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.250
- He's doomed, this will never work.

43:51.250 --> 43:53.291
What the heck were we thinking?

43:53.291 --> 43:55.666
- [Changu] Remember,
Mangu, speak the truth

43:55.666 --> 43:59.541
and your words will fly into their hearts.

43:59.541 --> 44:01.041
- Hey, Mangu, if you forgot your speech,

44:01.041 --> 44:05.375
you can always dance.
(audience laughs)

44:05.375 --> 44:07.083
- No, my friend.

44:07.083 --> 44:09.625
I haven't forgotten anything,
but you don't need me

44:09.625 --> 44:14.250
to give a speech to you,
what good is another speech?

44:14.250 --> 44:18.416
Royalty and politicians, they
will say anything to you,

44:18.416 --> 44:20.208
say any old thing.

44:20.208 --> 44:21.791
They usually say, "Vote for me,

44:21.791 --> 44:24.583
"and your troubles will
vanish like magic."

44:24.583 --> 44:26.791
They will go to your neighbor
or your mother in law.

44:26.791 --> 44:28.958
(audience laughs)

44:28.958 --> 44:33.083
But that is not how things
work, this is the real world.

44:33.083 --> 44:36.208
Uncle Zandar, you're here,
glad you could make it.

44:36.208 --> 44:38.000
Sit down, sit down.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.791
- Hey, donkey, we're not
here to meet your family.

44:40.791 --> 44:42.583
(audience laughs)

44:42.583 --> 44:46.250
- All right, you got
me, I'm a donkey, I am.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.250
I shoulder the burdens of the world,

44:49.250 --> 44:50.625
but if that makes me a donkey, well,

44:50.625 --> 44:53.625
then, all of you out
there are donkeys, too.

44:53.625 --> 44:57.541
Look, I see a donkey there,
and there's another one.

44:57.541 --> 45:02.125
And there, you too, you with
the horns, you're a donkey.

45:02.125 --> 45:03.875
- Mangu, watch your mouth.

45:03.875 --> 45:05.958
- Sadly I cannot do that, my friend.

45:05.958 --> 45:07.875
My teeth get in the way.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.583
(audience laughs)

45:10.583 --> 45:12.458
What I'm saying is this.

45:12.458 --> 45:16.708
It's not your looks that make
you a donkey, but your mind.

45:16.708 --> 45:20.625
It takes a whole jungle,
no one can live alone.

45:20.625 --> 45:23.083
We can't be greedy, we need each other.

45:23.083 --> 45:25.375
We must set aside our petty differences

45:25.375 --> 45:27.291
and stop being selfish.

45:28.416 --> 45:31.208
We have to work together, everyone,

45:31.208 --> 45:33.166
and shoulder our burdens together,

45:33.166 --> 45:35.583
not just be content to push them aside.

45:35.583 --> 45:38.916
Azad City can be a place
of peace and harmony.

45:38.916 --> 45:41.375
We can make that happen.

45:41.375 --> 45:44.125
Then it won't matter who you make king,

45:44.125 --> 45:46.791
Prince Shazad or a silly donkey.

45:47.833 --> 45:50.416
Thank you, I have nothing more.

45:55.250 --> 45:58.958
(Zandar claps)
(audience applauds)

45:58.958 --> 46:02.458
(upbeat orchestral music)

46:11.166 --> 46:14.500
(slow orchestral music)

46:17.916 --> 46:19.833
- Hey, aren't you gonna vote today?

46:19.833 --> 46:21.250
- What's the point, my friend?

46:21.250 --> 46:23.083
One vote won't make a difference.

46:23.083 --> 46:25.083
- You make a good point.

46:26.791 --> 46:29.958
- Get up, you, you need to
go out and cast your vote.

46:29.958 --> 46:34.250
- Your voice is like a
jackhammer on my brain, woman.

46:34.250 --> 46:37.583
I'm tired, can't you go
vote for the both of us?

46:37.583 --> 46:39.750
- I'm ashamed to know you.

46:41.541 --> 46:42.875
- Excuse me, my friend,

46:42.875 --> 46:44.375
who do you think will win the election?

46:44.375 --> 46:46.083
- I don't care at all.

46:46.083 --> 46:46.916
- You don't care?

46:46.916 --> 46:51.416
- No, the key to happiness
is, just don't care at all.

46:52.750 --> 46:55.375
(slow orchestral music)

46:55.375 --> 46:57.375
- It's election day, I'm so excited.

46:57.375 --> 47:01.041
The polls are closing, but no
one's at the polling stations,

47:01.041 --> 47:03.541
not even the dumb birds.
(bird caws)

47:03.541 --> 47:05.958
Get lost, beat it, it
seems that only members

47:05.958 --> 47:07.791
of the royal family have even bothered

47:07.791 --> 47:09.958
to show up and cast their vote.

47:09.958 --> 47:12.875
Is the rest of the country
sleeping through the election?

47:12.875 --> 47:17.833
Keep watching (grunts) Monkey
News, it's a family thing.

47:17.833 --> 47:20.125
- I will protect the
rights of all animals.

47:20.125 --> 47:22.583
- My king, no one's showing up to vote,

47:22.583 --> 47:24.416
and no one's going to, either.

47:24.416 --> 47:26.541
Shazad, you might as well
pick out what you want to wear

47:26.541 --> 47:27.791
because you're going to win.

47:27.791 --> 47:29.125
- Dad, which jacket do

47:29.125 --> 47:31.375
you think will get me
more likes on Facebook?

47:31.375 --> 47:34.625
- No likes, be serious, and grow up.

47:34.625 --> 47:37.625
Fitna, if you have things
under control here,

47:37.625 --> 47:39.333
I need to take a nap.

47:39.333 --> 47:41.625
- That's a very good idea, absolutely.

47:41.625 --> 47:46.625
Rest easy, I have it all under
control, my King. (laughs)

47:46.916 --> 47:50.125
- I never thought getting
old would be so painful.

47:50.125 --> 47:52.000
- The situation is under my control,

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
and now it's time to turn
things to chaos. (laughs)

47:59.250 --> 48:02.375
(phone vibrates)

48:02.375 --> 48:03.333
Hi, Jake.

48:03.333 --> 48:04.833
- Yes, boss?

48:04.833 --> 48:07.000
- [Fitna] It's showtime.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.416
- Got it, boss. (laughs)

48:17.291 --> 48:20.041
(car horn honks)

48:22.583 --> 48:25.666
(slow orchestral music)

48:25.666 --> 48:29.458
- Hey, Zandar, come here, you hear me?

48:29.458 --> 48:30.875
I said come here.

48:31.833 --> 48:34.666
- Hey, bear, would you
like some ice cream?

48:34.666 --> 48:37.416
- You don't, eh, ungrateful.

48:37.416 --> 48:42.416
- You see, about the vote,
don't bother, just go on home.

48:42.708 --> 48:43.875
- And if I don't?

48:43.875 --> 48:46.250
- What? (laughs)

48:46.250 --> 48:47.458
Have you forgotten how much

48:47.458 --> 48:50.541
the royal family loves a good barbecue?

48:50.541 --> 48:55.541
After all, lions are naturally
carnivorous. (laughs)

48:56.583 --> 48:58.000
- I'm not scared.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.541
- Move along, teddy bear,
voting is closed. (laughs)

49:01.541 --> 49:05.333
No one's voting here today,
go home, enjoy the day.

49:05.333 --> 49:09.250
We'll cast your vote for you,
now go, voting is closed, go.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.333
(background noise drowns out speaker)

49:10.333 --> 49:13.000
(crowd screams)

49:20.291 --> 49:22.791
- We will not be intimidated by them.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.708
We'll prove that you can't stop the will

49:24.708 --> 49:27.958
of the animals, the will of the animals.

49:27.958 --> 49:30.666
Now come on, follow me.

49:30.666 --> 49:33.333
(slow drumming)

49:35.416 --> 49:36.250
Wake up!

49:37.583 --> 49:38.500
- Hmm?

49:38.500 --> 49:39.333
- Huh?

49:40.583 --> 49:41.625
- [Group] Hmm?

49:41.625 --> 49:44.958
- People of Azad City, wake up, wake up!

49:48.958 --> 49:53.541
We must all go and vote, I
don't care who you vote for,

49:54.833 --> 49:59.166
Mangu or Shazad, I'm just
asking you to go and vote.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.958
It's true, your vote counts.

50:04.125 --> 50:08.958
Far too often, the wrong
candidates can be elected

50:08.958 --> 50:13.416
because good people don't
bother to go and vote.

50:13.416 --> 50:16.375
But today, we can change things.

50:16.375 --> 50:19.125
You have to vote, so do you.

50:19.125 --> 50:22.375
We can change the destiny of Azad City.

50:22.375 --> 50:26.041
Wake up, everyone must
go and vote, go vote.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.875
Go vote, go vote.

50:30.958 --> 50:33.458
- You know what, the
bear has the right idea.

50:33.458 --> 50:36.583
One day we'll regret it
if we don't cast our vote.

50:36.583 --> 50:38.833
- Come, my brothers,
come, Zandar is right.

50:38.833 --> 50:40.791
It's time to vote, come on.

50:40.791 --> 50:41.625
- Come on.

50:41.625 --> 50:46.625
- Come on, everyone, you too.
(uplifting orchestral music)

50:47.833 --> 50:49.333
Come on, let's go.

51:21.791 --> 51:24.750
(slow orchestral music)

51:24.750 --> 51:26.416
- The vote counting is underway.

51:26.416 --> 51:29.041
In just a few moments, we'll know who won,

51:29.041 --> 51:32.291
and then our nation will
have a brand new king,

51:32.291 --> 51:33.958
new king, new king.

51:33.958 --> 51:36.333
While we wait for
tonight's election results,

51:36.333 --> 51:39.833
I am joined in the studio
by two very special guests,

51:39.833 --> 51:42.333
the very well dressed
government representative,

51:42.333 --> 51:45.333
Mr. Propaganda, and Mangu's
rather poorly dressed

51:45.333 --> 51:48.958
Uncle Perry, Uncle Perry,
what insights can you give us

51:48.958 --> 51:50.750
about Mangu as a child?

51:50.750 --> 51:52.916
- Ask anyone, I was like a father to him.

51:52.916 --> 51:54.833
I showed him almost everything in life.

51:54.833 --> 51:57.291
I told him, you gotta reach
high if you want the best.

51:57.291 --> 52:00.166
I always believed he was
destined to be our king.

52:00.166 --> 52:01.708
Mark my words, in no time at all,

52:01.708 --> 52:04.375
he'll bring us all together. (laughs)

52:04.375 --> 52:06.875
- Is it true that Mangu
has always been something

52:06.875 --> 52:08.875
of an irresponsible daydreamer?

52:08.875 --> 52:11.958
- Mangu wasn't being
irresponsible, it was important.

52:11.958 --> 52:14.583
In fact, every morning, I would
smack him when he woke up.

52:14.583 --> 52:15.416
- You wouldn't.

52:15.416 --> 52:17.583
- Of course I would, he needed to go back

52:17.583 --> 52:20.250
to sleep if he was gonna keep on dreaming.

52:20.250 --> 52:22.833
Donkey, donkey, dreaming donkey, donkey.

52:22.833 --> 52:25.625
- You may mark my words,
Prince Shazad will win.

52:25.625 --> 52:28.625
- You seem a little nervous,
afraid he'll lose to a donkey?

52:28.625 --> 52:30.500
- [Mr. Propaganda] How
dare you, I will see to it

52:30.500 --> 52:31.958
that your laundromat is closed.

52:31.958 --> 52:33.625
- Then I'm gonna completely cut off

52:33.625 --> 52:34.750
your laundry service, buddy.

52:34.750 --> 52:37.291
- I hereby announce that
if Mangu wins the election,

52:37.291 --> 52:39.000
I will officially change my name.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.083
- Will you go with Fluffy
or Whiskers? (laughs)

52:42.083 --> 52:43.875
No, how about Twinkle Toes?

52:43.875 --> 52:45.875
- That's it, I'm done with this interview.

52:45.875 --> 52:49.041
- Let the little kittycat go,
I'll send him a bumper sticker

52:49.041 --> 52:51.333
when we win. (laughs)

52:51.333 --> 52:53.416
- I can't let him go, he took our mic--

52:53.416 --> 52:54.416
- I have one more thing to say--

52:54.416 --> 52:55.458
- [Uncle Perry] Back for more, Sparkles?

52:55.458 --> 52:56.416
- [Mr. Propaganda] Watch it, pal.

52:56.416 --> 52:57.750
- Why don't you go chase your tail?

52:57.750 --> 52:58.583
- Shut up.

52:58.583 --> 52:59.916
- You shut up.

52:59.916 --> 53:00.833
- I'll have you jailed.

53:00.833 --> 53:01.916
- You'll make a nice rug.

53:01.916 --> 53:03.000
- I'll rip your ears off.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.125
- I'll kick you into next year.

53:04.125 --> 53:05.500
- I'll have you in a sandwich.
- I've got breaking news.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.041
- He could use a little catnip.

53:07.041 --> 53:07.958
- Be quiet!

53:09.958 --> 53:12.500
The official results have
started to come pouring in,

53:12.500 --> 53:15.375
from Bear Colony, Fish
Market, Buffalo Road,

53:15.375 --> 53:19.125
Monkey Avenue, Hippo
Hill, it's everywhere.

53:19.125 --> 53:23.333
Mangu is the winner,
he won in a landslide.

53:23.333 --> 53:26.083
- Yeah, donkey, he really did it!

53:27.583 --> 53:30.000
Everybody, Mangu won, he's now the king.

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
(crowd cheers)
(upbeat drumming)

53:36.458 --> 53:38.500
You are no longer just a donkey.

53:38.500 --> 53:41.583
From now on, you are the Donkey King.

53:42.458 --> 53:45.708
- I can't believe it, could
this really have happened?

53:45.708 --> 53:49.750
- Come on, come on, let's
march to the palace, let's go!

53:49.750 --> 53:53.333
- [Crowd] All hail Donkey
King, king of all the animals!

53:53.333 --> 53:56.833
All hail Donkey King,
king of all the animals!

53:56.833 --> 54:00.666
All hail Donkey King,
king of all the animals!

54:04.958 --> 54:07.833
- What is that outside, so much noise.

54:07.833 --> 54:10.791
Fitna, Super Guard, what's
going on, where is everyone?

54:10.791 --> 54:14.875
- My king, it's a
disaster, a total disaster.

54:14.875 --> 54:16.416
We're finished, I can't take it.

54:16.416 --> 54:17.250
- What happened?

54:17.250 --> 54:20.041
- The donkey, my Lord, the
one who shoulders the burden

54:20.041 --> 54:22.166
of the animals, he's riding the shoulders

54:22.166 --> 54:24.375
of the animals right now.

54:24.375 --> 54:27.166
My Lord, Mangu has won the election.

54:27.166 --> 54:29.625
I don't know how, but he has won.

54:29.625 --> 54:32.041
Our life in the palace is over. (cries)

54:32.041 --> 54:33.625
- How is that even possible?

54:33.625 --> 54:34.458
- Yes.

54:35.583 --> 54:39.916
Sir, I wish you had never
decided to hold this election.

54:39.916 --> 54:42.333
I've heard of people shooting
themselves in the foot,

54:42.333 --> 54:46.375
but you managed to shoot
yourself in the head, so sad.

54:46.375 --> 54:49.583
I just want to tell you, you
made a horrible mistake, sir.

54:49.583 --> 54:51.833
It was a terrible mistake you made.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.541
- But this idea was all yours, Fitna--

54:53.541 --> 54:56.791
(glass shatters)

54:56.791 --> 55:01.250
- King Khan, my king, we
can sort this out later.

55:01.250 --> 55:03.583
Right now, we have to get
you out of the palace.

55:03.583 --> 55:05.291
The crowd is getting out of control

55:05.291 --> 55:07.208
and I'm worried they'll come for you.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.583
I couldn't bear to see that happen to you.

55:09.583 --> 55:13.041
I think you need to go
into hiding for a while.

55:13.041 --> 55:15.833
(dramatic orchestral music)

55:15.833 --> 55:18.750
- [Mangu] Miss Fitna, Miss Fox?

55:18.750 --> 55:21.625
- Just hold that thought,
I'll be right back.

55:21.625 --> 55:24.458
(thunder rumbles)

55:28.458 --> 55:31.708
- Ancestors, I beg your forgiveness.

55:31.708 --> 55:35.250
My mistake has brought
our dynasty to an end.

55:35.250 --> 55:38.333
- My Lord, we must hurry, we
can use the secret passageway

55:38.333 --> 55:40.666
to escape the palace, hurry.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.333
- The country will be ruled by a donkey.

55:53.916 --> 55:57.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

56:02.916 --> 56:07.041
- Help me, help me, help me,
help me, help me, help me.

56:07.041 --> 56:09.000
- Super Dude, be gentle.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.791
The donkey is now the king of the country.

56:12.791 --> 56:14.583
- Yes, I know, he's filthy

56:14.583 --> 56:17.250
and should take a bath
before the crowning ceremony.

56:17.250 --> 56:18.625
- I don't want to take a bath.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.208
I'm not really a fan of cold water.

56:20.208 --> 56:22.833
- But Mangu, I mean, Your Majesty,

56:22.833 --> 56:23.875
I don't think you really want

56:23.875 --> 56:25.375
to smell bad when you are introduced

56:25.375 --> 56:28.583
to the animals as their
new king, am I right?

56:28.583 --> 56:29.833
- On one condition.
- What?

56:29.833 --> 56:32.333
- I will not use shower
gel, it dries out my skin.

56:32.333 --> 56:34.083
- I beg to differ with you, my Lord.

56:34.083 --> 56:36.791
It makes your skin as
smooth as a baby's bottom.

56:36.791 --> 56:38.833
- Really, that's not what you said.

56:38.833 --> 56:40.583
- I will drop and do 20 pushups.

56:40.583 --> 56:41.416
- No way.

56:41.416 --> 56:42.250
- Thank you, sir.

56:42.250 --> 56:45.000
- Draw my bath, I'll use the gel.

56:46.333 --> 56:50.000
Be very careful, (laughs)
'cause I'm ticklish.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.625
- Don't forget to use the royal shampoo

56:51.625 --> 56:54.625
and conditioner, my Lord,
we wouldn't be his fur not

56:54.625 --> 56:56.791
to be silky smooth when
he meets his public

56:56.791 --> 56:59.333
for the first time. (laughs)

(upbeat drumming)

57:20.791 --> 57:23.708
(slow brass music)

57:26.541 --> 57:30.041
- Attention, stand and behold His Majesty,

57:31.333 --> 57:34.750
the king of the jungle, Mangu the donkey.

57:52.500 --> 57:55.583
- People of Azad City,
look proudly upon me

57:55.583 --> 58:00.583
and raise your ears, use your
tails to whip the flies away

58:00.583 --> 58:05.583
because Azad is now under
donkey rule. (brays)

but when the lions come back,
I'm worried they'll kill us.

1:01:04.125 --> 1:01:06.791
(dissonant piano music)

1:01:06.791 --> 1:01:08.583

Just remember what I told you.

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:13.916
Lions and elephants may
be stronger than we are,

1:01:13.916 --> 1:01:16.375
but where could they all end up?

1:01:16.375 --> 1:01:18.250
- The circus, in the circus.

1:01:18.250 --> 1:01:20.333
- Finished off, so true,
(phone rings)

1:01:20.333 --> 1:01:24.000
little lizard, so true. (laughs)

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.916

Fitna, talking to you live

Sir, hello, sir, I was just
about to call you, yes, I was.

1:01:47.458 --> 1:01:49.708
Mangu the donkey has been elected king.

1:01:49.708 --> 1:01:51.583
I just need some more time,

but everything is going according to plan.

1:01:55.083 --> 1:01:56.708

1:01:56.708 --> 1:02:00.708
Sir, I promise, everything
will be fine, I promise.

1:02:00.708 --> 1:02:03.958
We will start the second phase tonight.

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:08.583
No, no, no, I can assure you
everything will go smoothly.

1:02:08.583 --> 1:02:11.666
There will be no mistakes, not one.

1:02:11.666 --> 1:02:14.583

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:19.291

1:02:21.208 --> 1:02:23.458
Goodbye, have a good night.

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:27.041

Please try to wake up
now, hop to it, King.

1:03:01.750 --> 1:03:05.750
- Good morning, Super
Dude, why did you wake me?

1:03:06.958 --> 1:03:09.541
I was about to get married
to a beautiful woman.

1:03:09.541 --> 1:03:12.208
- But my Lord, you
can't just marry anyone.

1:03:12.208 --> 1:03:14.916
You're the new king, the donkey king.

1:03:14.916 --> 1:03:16.541
- Why didn't you tell me this before?

1:03:16.541 --> 1:03:19.041
- I'm very sorry, Majesty,
I'll drop and give you 20.

1:03:19.041 --> 1:03:20.375
- Nonsense.

1:03:20.375 --> 1:03:24.041
- Thank you, sir, a crowd
waits to speak to you.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:26.458
- A crowd, let us greet them.

1:03:29.833 --> 1:03:32.583
- Attention, all, I said, attention all.

1:03:32.583 --> 1:03:34.875
Be wise and stand down.

1:03:34.875 --> 1:03:35.875
- What do you mean?

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:39.125
Is there someone plotting
evil against our new king?

1:03:39.125 --> 1:03:43.125
- What I meant was stand
downwind, just in case.

1:03:44.750 --> 1:03:47.583
- Your Majesty, when the last king left,

1:03:47.583 --> 1:03:49.250
the government went with him,

1:03:49.250 --> 1:03:51.250
so nobody knows what should be done.

1:03:51.250 --> 1:03:53.708
- What, you're right,
we need a government.

1:03:53.708 --> 1:03:55.125
So who will put that together?

1:03:55.125 --> 1:03:55.958
- You do.

1:03:55.958 --> 1:04:00.958
- Oh, well, then I shall build
a government. (cries out)

1:04:02.041 --> 1:04:03.875
All righty, what exactly do we need?

1:04:03.875 --> 1:04:06.750
- Your Majesty, one of the
first things we need is someone

1:04:06.750 --> 1:04:09.625
to go to when we have a complaint.

1:04:09.625 --> 1:04:12.333
- A Minister of Complaints, you say?

1:04:12.333 --> 1:04:15.000
So who could we name, any ideas?

1:04:15.916 --> 1:04:17.958
- What if we name that sparkling TV guy,

1:04:17.958 --> 1:04:19.708
Lando, as Minister of Complaints?

1:04:19.708 --> 1:04:22.250
- Yes, that's a great idea, Lando?

1:04:22.250 --> 1:04:23.083
- Yes?

1:04:23.083 --> 1:04:23.916
- Do you agree?

1:04:23.916 --> 1:04:25.375
- You want me to eat a tree?

1:04:25.375 --> 1:04:27.666
- Not eat a tree, agree.

1:04:27.666 --> 1:04:28.500
- What?

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:30.333
- Lando, do you agree?

1:04:31.583 --> 1:04:33.041
- He's so crazy tall that none

1:04:33.041 --> 1:04:34.541
of the people's complaints
will ever make it up

1:04:34.541 --> 1:04:37.083
to reach his ears. (laughs)

1:04:37.083 --> 1:04:38.333
- Your Highness, we could also

1:04:38.333 --> 1:04:40.916
really use some new policemen.

1:04:40.916 --> 1:04:44.375
- Hmm, it seems that we
need a new Chief of Police.

1:04:44.375 --> 1:04:46.833
Who could it be, who could it be?

1:04:46.833 --> 1:04:50.333
- I think Rapid would make
a great Chief of Police.

1:04:50.333 --> 1:04:52.625
- Right, great idea, Rapid?

1:04:52.625 --> 1:04:54.541
- Did somebody call me?

1:04:54.541 --> 1:04:56.958
I was so busy with my meditation.

1:04:56.958 --> 1:04:58.583
- I'm naming you Chief of Police.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:05:01.583
The safety of the city is
on your shoulders, okay?

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:03.916
- Hold on, let me get this straight.

1:05:03.916 --> 1:05:07.250
You want me to put the
entire city on my shoulders?

1:05:07.250 --> 1:05:10.000
- That turtle is so
slow, by the time he gets

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:13.791
to the scene of a crime,
it'll be too late. (laughs)

1:05:13.791 --> 1:05:16.166
He would make even humans seem fast.

1:05:16.166 --> 1:05:17.875
- My King, we desperately need teachers

1:05:17.875 --> 1:05:19.458
for all of our schools.

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:22.375
- Teachers, new teachers, teachers?

1:05:24.416 --> 1:05:27.208
- Nothing says you have
to strain your brain.

1:05:27.208 --> 1:05:29.333
You've made some big decisions today, sir.

1:05:29.333 --> 1:05:30.708
It's a lot for a donkey.

1:05:30.708 --> 1:05:35.708
- You're absolutely right,
(snorts) yes, yes, yes.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.583
It's a lot for a donkey to do. (brays)

1:05:44.375 --> 1:05:47.625
But I am now the king, with
an important job to do,

1:05:47.625 --> 1:05:49.750
the one who must teach the children is me.

1:05:49.750 --> 1:05:50.583
- Are you sure that's--

1:05:50.583 --> 1:05:52.833
- That's enough, this meeting is over.

1:05:52.833 --> 1:05:54.375
The king needs his rest.

1:05:54.375 --> 1:05:57.708
- That's so true, anyway,
I have laundry to do.

1:05:57.708 --> 1:05:59.166
I'm done here.

1:05:59.166 --> 1:06:01.583
(wolf howls)

1:06:03.708 --> 1:06:07.291

1:06:12.083 --> 1:06:14.833
(goat cries out)

1:06:19.916 --> 1:06:21.583
- Hello, police, this is the police?

1:06:21.583 --> 1:06:23.750
I'm not sure, but I think someone
followed me into my house.

1:06:23.750 --> 1:06:24.583
Send help right--

1:06:24.583 --> 1:06:27.333

1:06:35.208 --> 1:06:39.833
(slow orchestral music)
(car wheels screeching)

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:41.583
- [Hippo] Help, help!

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:46.166
(Mangu snores)

1:06:47.875 --> 1:06:52.083
- Wake up, my king, you look
good, how are you feeling?

1:06:52.083 --> 1:06:53.166
- Dad, again?

1:06:54.833 --> 1:06:58.083
Do I notice you're calling
me king instead of Mangu?

1:06:58.083 --> 1:07:00.458
- But of course, what
else should I call you?

1:07:00.458 --> 1:07:03.416
Because now you're the king.

1:07:03.416 --> 1:07:05.791
So how are you, are you happy now?

1:07:05.791 --> 1:07:07.958
- Me? (laughs)

1:07:07.958 --> 1:07:11.583
I'm like King Midas, even
moldy, useless dirt turns

1:07:11.583 --> 1:07:14.583
to gold in my touch, I'm ridiculously rich

1:07:14.583 --> 1:07:18.000
and have the unlimited power
that anyone could ever want.

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.875
I have achieved all these
great accomplishments

1:07:19.875 --> 1:07:22.708
through my own work, I
did it all on my own.

1:07:22.708 --> 1:07:23.625
- Your own?

1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:25.916
You really think so?

1:07:25.916 --> 1:07:28.458
- You think you helped
me with any of this?

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:30.708
- What about all the animals?

1:07:30.708 --> 1:07:32.125
They voted for you.

1:07:32.125 --> 1:07:35.250
- Voters, they just do
what they're told, yeah.

1:07:35.250 --> 1:07:38.041
- So now you think you're
better than everyone.

1:07:38.041 --> 1:07:42.083
Watch out, the higher you may
fly, the farther you fall.

1:07:42.083 --> 1:07:44.583
- Earth to Dad, I'm
Mangu, believe it or not,

1:07:44.583 --> 1:07:45.791
I don't need you to haunt me

1:07:45.791 --> 1:07:47.625
and speak in riddles all the time.

1:07:47.625 --> 1:07:51.708
I'm no longer a child,
I'm now the donkey king.

1:07:51.708 --> 1:07:55.250
Now go away, (yawns) now let me sleep.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:57.250
- Sleep while you can, my son.

1:07:57.250 --> 1:08:02.250
Your future may not be as
restful as you think. (chuckles)

1:08:02.541 --> 1:08:06.125
- My poor dad, he was
always just a donkey.

1:08:07.041 --> 1:08:09.125
I've never been so tired.

1:08:10.583 --> 1:08:13.416
- [Crowd] We demand
action, we demand action!

1:08:13.416 --> 1:08:16.166
We demand action, we demand action!

1:08:16.166 --> 1:08:19.708
We demand action, we demand action!

1:08:19.708 --> 1:08:22.625
We demand action, we demand action!

1:08:23.541 --> 1:08:26.541
- What is the problem, what
are you protesting about?

1:08:26.541 --> 1:08:29.583
- Your Majesty, bad news,
something terrible has happened.

1:08:29.583 --> 1:08:32.041
Many animals in the
town have gone missing.

1:08:32.041 --> 1:08:33.541
- Animals have gone missing, you say?

1:08:33.541 --> 1:08:34.916
Why wasn't I made aware of this?

1:08:34.916 --> 1:08:36.958
- Don't worry, my King, it's only a rumor.

1:08:36.958 --> 1:08:39.583
- This is not just a rumor, it's a fact.

1:08:39.583 --> 1:08:42.166
- If something like this
happened, then Jambora would have

1:08:42.166 --> 1:08:45.125
to be the first to know, right, Jambora?

1:08:45.125 --> 1:08:47.708
- If I don't agree with her,
I know she will expose me,

1:08:47.708 --> 1:08:49.500
and then I'll be ruined.

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:53.458
No, no, no, I'm pretty sure
that it's just a rumor,

1:08:53.458 --> 1:08:54.291
and that's all.

1:08:54.291 --> 1:08:57.791
- If it's really only a
rumor, then where's Sandy,

1:08:57.791 --> 1:08:59.541
or Brian, Alan, Nina?

1:09:00.625 --> 1:09:02.250
Explain it, they're gone.

1:09:02.250 --> 1:09:05.208
Were they abducted by some kind of aliens?

1:09:05.208 --> 1:09:07.208
- I'm sure you're overreacting.

1:09:07.208 --> 1:09:10.000
- No, no, this is really happening.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.333
I bet you know something
about it, don't you?

1:09:12.333 --> 1:09:13.750
Come clean, tell the truth.

1:09:13.750 --> 1:09:16.166
- [Crowd] The truth, tell us the truth.

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:18.083
The truth, tell us the truth--
- Enough of this.

1:09:18.083 --> 1:09:19.625
We'll get to the bottom of this.

1:09:19.625 --> 1:09:22.166
We just need the right man, Rapid?

1:09:22.166 --> 1:09:24.833
(slow drumming)

1:09:27.750 --> 1:09:29.291
(Rapid chuckles)

1:09:29.291 --> 1:09:31.083
Stop laughing, Rapid, we have animals

1:09:31.083 --> 1:09:32.666
from our city that are missing.

1:09:32.666 --> 1:09:34.750
Begin the investigation straightaway,

1:09:34.750 --> 1:09:38.000
and leave no stone unturned, my orders.

1:09:39.458 --> 1:09:41.625
(Rapid yawns)

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:44.708
(upbeat drumming)

1:09:44.708 --> 1:09:48.875
- Officer, Officer, my son has
been missing for three days.

1:09:48.875 --> 1:09:52.791
- I see, you say your son
has been missing, yeah?

1:09:52.791 --> 1:09:54.208
- Yes.

1:09:54.208 --> 1:09:56.541
- So when was the last time you saw him?

1:09:56.541 --> 1:10:00.458
- Well, his last Instagram
post was three days ago.

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:03.458
- I'm sure you're making
a big deal out of nothing.

1:10:03.458 --> 1:10:04.791
You know what I think?

1:10:04.791 --> 1:10:07.458
No doubt he ran off and partied too hard.

1:10:07.458 --> 1:10:09.875
Go home and call me if you get a post.

1:10:09.875 --> 1:10:10.708
- Yes.

1:10:11.625 --> 1:10:15.041
- Sit down, Mr. Hippo, who
is it you're looking for?

1:10:15.041 --> 1:10:17.416
- Well, it's my wife, she
left early this morning

1:10:17.416 --> 1:10:19.041
and hasn't come back yet.

1:10:19.041 --> 1:10:21.875
- My hearty congrats,
you're a free man now.

1:10:21.875 --> 1:10:23.458
Of course I'm only kidding.

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:25.666
Can you tell me what color her eyes are?

1:10:25.666 --> 1:10:27.083
- I can't say I ever noticed,

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:29.541
but to me they always look angrily red.

1:10:29.541 --> 1:10:30.750
- What about her hair?

1:10:30.750 --> 1:10:33.250
- I don't know her real
color, she always dyes it.

1:10:33.250 --> 1:10:36.541
- Oh, I'll bet she was
driving in her car--

1:10:36.541 --> 1:10:38.958
- Yes, yes, you're absolutely right, yes.

1:10:38.958 --> 1:10:42.458
- Of course I am, tell me
everything you know about her car.

1:10:42.458 --> 1:10:43.958
- Black Honda Civic VTI

1:10:43.958 --> 1:10:46.250
with supercharged V6 three liter engine

1:10:46.250 --> 1:10:49.500
that gets 330 horsepower
automatic transmission,

1:10:49.500 --> 1:10:51.875
and it's complete with
full LED headlights.

1:10:51.875 --> 1:10:54.666
- You're talking so fast,
saying so many things,

1:10:54.666 --> 1:10:57.958
you're making me dizzy, you
should get a speeding ticket,

1:10:57.958 --> 1:10:59.708
but I'll give you a break.

1:10:59.708 --> 1:11:02.041
I'll find your wife, don't sweat it.

1:11:02.041 --> 1:11:04.000
You'll be hearing from me shortly.

1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:04.833
- Great.

1:11:06.958 --> 1:11:08.791
- My Lord, what do you
think you would like

1:11:08.791 --> 1:11:10.083
to have for dinner?

1:11:10.083 --> 1:11:13.166
- Well, yesterday I had
baked beans. (farts)

1:11:13.166 --> 1:11:14.750
Why did you do that?

1:11:14.750 --> 1:11:16.500
But today, I think I should have salad.

1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:18.166
- That's not what chef made today.

1:11:18.166 --> 1:11:20.166
Instead we have royal meatballs.

1:11:20.166 --> 1:11:22.708
- Royal meatballs, but I'm a vegetarian.

1:11:22.708 --> 1:11:25.250
- Mangu, my Lord, as king,

1:11:25.250 --> 1:11:27.625
you must represent all
your people, which means,

1:11:27.625 --> 1:11:30.666
in point of fact, you
have to be an omnivore.

1:11:30.666 --> 1:11:32.583
- I do, why didn't you tell me?

1:11:32.583 --> 1:11:36.208
- Sorry, sir, I'll drop and give you 20.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:37.041
- Get out of here.

1:11:37.041 --> 1:11:38.041
- Thank you.

1:11:42.250 --> 1:11:44.291
(Mangu burps)

1:11:44.291 --> 1:11:48.500
- These meatballs are
actually pretty delicious.

1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:50.583
- Finally, those meatballs
were specially made

1:11:50.583 --> 1:11:54.250
to put him to sleep. (gags)

1:12:03.875 --> 1:12:07.458
(ominous orchestral music)

1:12:11.250 --> 1:12:14.250
(car engine stalls)

1:12:16.583 --> 1:12:19.333
(elevator rings)

1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.583
(tiger knocks)

1:12:41.416 --> 1:12:44.125
- Don't worry, my brothers,
I know it looks bad,

1:12:44.125 --> 1:12:49.125
but you can mark my words, our
friends will return, Kiddo?

1:12:49.250 --> 1:12:50.875
Can you put a pot of coffee on?

1:12:50.875 --> 1:12:52.333
- There is no coffee,

1:12:52.333 --> 1:12:55.208
not until we can get the
gas to come on again.

1:12:55.208 --> 1:12:57.208
- We have no gas, we have no water,

1:12:57.208 --> 1:12:59.958
no electricity, and folks are missing,

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:03.166
all because we let the
donkey become the king.

1:13:03.166 --> 1:13:05.333
- Well, it could be much worse,

1:13:05.333 --> 1:13:09.083
but I sure don't know how. (laughs)

1:13:09.083 --> 1:13:11.750
- Oh, we have light, finally, electricity.

1:13:11.750 --> 1:13:13.000
Spoke too soon.

1:13:18.916 --> 1:13:20.000
- What was in

1:13:20.833 --> 1:13:23.833
those meatballs? (groans)

1:13:23.833 --> 1:13:26.083
I can't sleep, I feel sick.

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:31.083
The bathroom will not smell
too good when I'm done.

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:33.208
- Another animal disappeared today,

1:13:33.208 --> 1:13:37.791
a bear from across the river,
and what's the palace doing?

1:13:37.791 --> 1:13:40.958
Absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing.

1:13:40.958 --> 1:13:43.666
We must have action, what
are the police doing?

1:13:43.666 --> 1:13:48.500
This crime wave must stop< these
criminals must be put away.

1:13:48.500 --> 1:13:51.416
Keep watching Monkey News all night.

1:13:51.416 --> 1:13:53.416
♪ Monkey News ♪

1:13:53.416 --> 1:13:54.916
- This is terrible.

1:13:54.916 --> 1:13:57.583
What the heck is my Chief
of Police doing about it?

1:13:57.583 --> 1:14:00.875
(phone rings)

1:14:00.875 --> 1:14:01.708
- Good afternoon.

1:14:01.708 --> 1:14:03.500
- It's nighttime, a bear has disappeared

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:05.208
across the river, go investigate.

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:08.083
- The river is far away
and will take a lot of time

1:14:08.083 --> 1:14:10.916
to get there, and I don't have that.

1:14:10.916 --> 1:14:12.750
- Wake up, Rapid, like it or not,

1:14:12.750 --> 1:14:15.250
you will go do your job
and I will meet you there.

1:14:15.250 --> 1:14:16.791
- I'll go as fast as I can.

1:14:16.791 --> 1:14:19.958
I'll even try to get a ride out there.

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:27.000
(slow orchestral music)

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:30.750
There are shoe prints
all over the crime scene.

1:14:30.750 --> 1:14:34.125
- But nobody wears shoes in the jungle.

1:14:34.125 --> 1:14:36.250
- Maybe it was an alien--

1:14:36.250 --> 1:14:38.541
- Oh, Rapid, if your
mind moved any slower,

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:40.875
your teeth wouldn't know
what to do in your mouth.

1:14:40.875 --> 1:14:44.708
Something's really suspicious
about this whole affair.

1:14:44.708 --> 1:14:46.916
- Shoe prints don't appear out of nowhere,

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:48.583
they must lead somewhere.

1:14:48.583 --> 1:14:50.000
- Super Dude, why didn't you tell me?

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:51.958
- Sorry, sir, I'll drop and give you 20.

1:14:51.958 --> 1:14:52.791
- Knock it off.

1:14:52.791 --> 1:14:53.625
- Thank you.

1:14:53.625 --> 1:14:54.625
- Follow me.

1:14:59.458 --> 1:15:02.500
There's a footprint and there's another.

1:15:02.500 --> 1:15:03.875
I think we're getting lucky,

1:15:03.875 --> 1:15:06.416
the trail leads right down this path.

1:15:06.416 --> 1:15:09.208
Hey, who turned off the sun, it's so dark.

1:15:09.208 --> 1:15:11.083
- My king, why don't we set up our camp?

1:15:11.083 --> 1:15:13.291
We'll continue the search in the morning.

1:15:13.291 --> 1:15:15.458
- That is a brilliant idea, Super Dude.

1:15:15.458 --> 1:15:17.291
- I'm sure you would
have thought of it soon.

1:15:17.291 --> 1:15:18.125
- You're right.

1:15:18.125 --> 1:15:19.125
- Thank you.

1:15:24.666 --> 1:15:28.500
(mosquitoes buzzing)

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:32.666
- These nasty mosquitoes,
I'll never get to sleep.

1:15:34.458 --> 1:15:38.875
Hmm, look at that, he's
fast asleep, pathetic.

1:15:38.875 --> 1:15:41.208
- Thank you, sir, thank you.

1:15:46.375 --> 1:15:47.666
- Those lights, what's that house

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:48.750
in the middle of the forest?

1:15:48.750 --> 1:15:51.166
And I wonder who lives there.

1:15:54.708 --> 1:15:55.541
Oh.

1:16:00.833 --> 1:16:04.500
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:09.833
Goodness, what are all these
animals doing in cages?

1:16:09.833 --> 1:16:10.666
- Mangu!

1:16:10.666 --> 1:16:14.041
(Mangu cries out)

1:16:14.041 --> 1:16:15.041
Mangu!

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:18.250
- My Lord, how, you shouldn't
be in there, my Lord.

1:16:18.250 --> 1:16:20.041
I mean, ex Lord because I'm king now.

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.916
Wow, this is pretty
awkward, don't you think?

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:23.666
- Get us out of this cage.

1:16:23.666 --> 1:16:25.458
- But how did you get in
the cage in the first place?

1:16:25.458 --> 1:16:30.166
- You wouldn't believe me if
I told you, but I'll tell you.

1:16:30.166 --> 1:16:32.083
Remember election night?

1:16:32.083 --> 1:16:34.000
(thunder crashes)

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.125
- My Lord, we must hurry, we
can use the secret passageway

1:16:37.125 --> 1:16:42.125
to escape the palace.
(slow orchestral music)

1:16:43.583 --> 1:16:46.708
- Miss Fitna, when will
we reach the safe house?

1:16:46.708 --> 1:16:49.791
It's so dark, just like life.

1:16:49.791 --> 1:16:52.541
- Fitna, when will we reach
the end of the tunnel?

1:16:52.541 --> 1:16:55.416
- My Lord, we are nearing
the end of our journey.

1:16:55.416 --> 1:16:57.666
If you can just be patient
for a little while longer,

1:16:57.666 --> 1:16:59.666
everything will sort itself out.

1:16:59.666 --> 1:17:02.208
Here we are, here's the end of the tunnel.

1:17:02.208 --> 1:17:03.375
See, like I told you,

1:17:03.375 --> 1:17:06.958
there's the entrance
right in front of you.

1:17:12.291 --> 1:17:14.791
- [Shazad] Where are we going?

1:17:19.708 --> 1:17:21.333
- Oh, no, no.

1:17:21.333 --> 1:17:23.583
- Fitna, how did this happen?

1:17:23.583 --> 1:17:27.041
- I have no idea how
we got trapped in here.

1:17:27.041 --> 1:17:29.708
But really, you're the one that's trapped,

1:17:29.708 --> 1:17:33.458
you and your son, (laughs) stupid son.

1:17:33.458 --> 1:17:38.458
- Is this a joke?
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:17:42.541 --> 1:17:45.541
(Ringmaster laughs)

1:17:49.041 --> 1:17:50.708
(whip cracks)

1:17:50.708 --> 1:17:54.250
- Welcome, welcome Ringmaster, sir.

1:17:54.250 --> 1:17:55.916
- Ringmaster, my butt.

1:17:55.916 --> 1:17:59.416
He looks just like a circus clown, a tool.

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:04.625
- You are quite mistaken,
Ringmaster is not the clown

1:18:04.625 --> 1:18:06.750
of the circus, no, he's not.

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:11.666
On the contrary, if I may say,
he's the king of the circus.

1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:17.000
(Ringmaster laughs)

1:18:19.250 --> 1:18:21.125
And now the two of you will
have the great pleasure

1:18:21.125 --> 1:18:22.833
of performing in his circus at the crack

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:24.833
of his whip, what fun.

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:27.250
I've always said lions and
elephants may be stronger,

1:18:27.250 --> 1:18:29.291
but they belong in the circus.

1:18:29.291 --> 1:18:31.875
This is only the
beginning, Ringmaster, sir.

1:18:31.875 --> 1:18:32.833
(whip cracks)

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:35.833
Oh, don't worry, I do
remember my promise to you.

1:18:35.833 --> 1:18:37.750
You told me to let the
elections happen and I did.

1:18:37.750 --> 1:18:38.750
(Ringmaster growls)

1:18:38.750 --> 1:18:41.166
Let the donkey wear the cap,
sorry, sorry, I mean crown,

1:18:41.166 --> 1:18:42.500
and then I will deliver hundreds

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:47.500
and hundreds of animals to
your circus, hundreds. (laughs)

1:18:47.625 --> 1:18:50.625
(Ringmaster laughs)

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:54.041
(whip cracks)

1:18:54.041 --> 1:18:58.250
- Fitna, how could I have been so foolish?

1:18:58.250 --> 1:19:00.333
All this time, I thought I was the king,

1:19:00.333 --> 1:19:03.000
but as it turns out, I was only a pawn.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.958
- Ah, their ultimate goal
was to steal all the animals

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:06.958
for the circus.

1:19:06.958 --> 1:19:08.000
- Got it, DK?

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:08.916
- DK?

1:19:08.916 --> 1:19:12.416
- It stands for donkey king,
don't you understand anything?

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:13.250
- Oh, yes.

1:19:16.208 --> 1:19:17.958
- It sounds like they're coming back.

1:19:17.958 --> 1:19:20.125
DK, you must get us out of here.

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:21.375
- You know, I may be a donkey,

1:19:21.375 --> 1:19:23.958
but that doesn't make me a
fool, I need a place to hide.

1:19:23.958 --> 1:19:27.541
(ominous orchestral music)

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.916
- Who were you just speaking to, old man?

1:19:31.916 --> 1:19:33.833
You better tell us right away, you better.

1:19:33.833 --> 1:19:36.833
- No one, no one, I was
just practicing my speech.

1:19:36.833 --> 1:19:37.958
- Just saying, the king

1:19:37.958 --> 1:19:40.208
of the jungle giving a
speech will be a huge hit

1:19:40.208 --> 1:19:42.500
in the circus. (laughs)

1:19:42.500 --> 1:19:44.000
(Ringmaster growls)

1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:44.833
- Daddy.

1:19:45.958 --> 1:19:49.291
- You talk to him, I'm right behind you.

1:19:59.958 --> 1:20:02.958
(Ringmaster laughs)

1:20:09.333 --> 1:20:10.333
(whip cracks)

1:20:10.333 --> 1:20:12.916
Ringmaster was very clear
when he said, what did he say?

1:20:12.916 --> 1:20:14.000
(Ringmaster growls)

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.375
(whip cracks)

1:20:15.375 --> 1:20:16.583
Maybe you should talk to him.

1:20:16.583 --> 1:20:19.708
- No need to be upset,
Ringmaster, everything is ready.

1:20:19.708 --> 1:20:21.208
Tomorrow morning, just as planned,

1:20:21.208 --> 1:20:23.250
I'll bring all the animals to the circus.

1:20:23.250 --> 1:20:26.250
(Ringmaster laughs)

1:20:37.083 --> 1:20:38.500
(door slams)

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:42.166
- Fitna, Fitna, you may do
what you have to with me,

1:20:42.166 --> 1:20:44.750
but for heaven's sake, spare
the rest of the animals.

1:20:44.750 --> 1:20:47.416
They're innocent, there's no
place for them in the circus.

1:20:47.416 --> 1:20:49.708
- Excuse me, why would I let them go?

1:20:49.708 --> 1:20:51.208
If we can't use them in the circus,

1:20:51.208 --> 1:20:54.166
we can sell their skins,
or perhaps we'll sell them

1:20:54.166 --> 1:20:59.166
for animal testing, there's
always a market. (laughs)

1:21:10.375 --> 1:21:12.541
(phone clatters)

1:21:12.541 --> 1:21:14.958
Godzilla, go see who that is.

1:21:18.041 --> 1:21:19.125
What is this?

1:21:21.166 --> 1:21:26.166
Come back here, stop.
(upbeat orchestral music)

1:21:27.958 --> 1:21:29.208
Come back here.

1:21:34.916 --> 1:21:38.666
I just want to see your
Twitter feed, honest.

1:21:41.958 --> 1:21:43.958
Can I offer you a bribe?

1:21:45.875 --> 1:21:48.625
He's so fast, is he part cheetah?

1:21:56.583 --> 1:21:58.416
Oh, snap, donkey dead.

1:22:05.833 --> 1:22:09.125
(Mangu snores)

1:22:09.125 --> 1:22:12.125
- Who said you could sleep?

1:22:12.125 --> 1:22:13.625
- What's going on?

1:22:18.375 --> 1:22:19.625
Father, Father.

1:22:21.458 --> 1:22:25.875
Father, I have to admit
it, I'm a complete fool.

1:22:25.875 --> 1:22:29.916
That evil fox made me do
some really terrible things.

1:22:29.916 --> 1:22:32.000
(Mangu cries)

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.333
- Son, despite what people may say,

1:22:34.333 --> 1:22:36.458
you have a brain up
there under that crown,

1:22:36.458 --> 1:22:38.625
and it's full of little gray cells,

1:22:38.625 --> 1:22:40.958
and now it is time for you to use it.

1:22:40.958 --> 1:22:43.125
- You told me that dreaming was good,

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:46.000
but I'm living a nightmare.
- Okay, calm down.

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.166
- [Mangu] I was under the
illusion that I was a king.

1:22:48.166 --> 1:22:49.833
- It's not an illusion.

1:22:49.833 --> 1:22:52.666
You are the legitimate king,
and you shouldn't need me

1:22:52.666 --> 1:22:56.750
to tell you that, so now
go and save your people.

1:22:57.875 --> 1:23:00.208
- I know you're right, wait,
let me upload this video

1:23:00.208 --> 1:23:01.833
to Facebook first, all right?

1:23:01.833 --> 1:23:04.208
- Oh, Mangu, forget it, in life you've got

1:23:04.208 --> 1:23:07.250
to face your problems, not Facebook them.

1:23:07.250 --> 1:23:11.041
- Dad, I don't know if
I can do this alone.

1:23:11.041 --> 1:23:12.000
Come with me, please.

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.458
- Sorry, you have to do this yourself.

1:23:14.458 --> 1:23:17.041
The people elected you king, now it's time

1:23:17.041 --> 1:23:21.000
to show them exactly why
they elected you king.

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.000
It's your story, Mangu, it's
your story, you are the hero.

1:23:26.125 --> 1:23:27.625
Now go on, get out there

1:23:27.625 --> 1:23:30.583
and be the king you promised
the animals you would be.

1:23:30.583 --> 1:23:31.416
- But--

1:23:31.416 --> 1:23:32.875
- Though you were born a donkey,

1:23:32.875 --> 1:23:35.875
now you wear the crown of a king.

1:23:35.875 --> 1:23:39.666
Now go, donkey king, don't
make me have to tell you again.

1:23:39.666 --> 1:23:44.666
Go and make me proud.
(upbeat orchestral music)

1:23:51.375 --> 1:23:53.875
A father's work is never done.

1:23:56.041 --> 1:23:57.916
- I haven't seen the king today.

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.541
Could he have been kidnapped too?

1:23:59.541 --> 1:24:01.458
- We should be so lucky,

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.958
then maybe things would
start working again.

1:24:03.958 --> 1:24:07.166
- There he is now, the new king.

1:24:07.166 --> 1:24:09.291
(Mangu pants)

1:24:09.291 --> 1:24:10.333
- Sir, sir.

1:24:10.333 --> 1:24:13.458
- Get that away from me, I
don't deserve the respect.

1:24:13.458 --> 1:24:14.458
- It's an umbrella.

1:24:14.458 --> 1:24:18.166
- Not now, brothers, I
need you to forgive me.

1:24:18.166 --> 1:24:21.291
Forgive me for how I failed
you, I didn't mean to.

1:24:21.291 --> 1:24:23.125
- But Mangu, what do you mean?

1:24:23.125 --> 1:24:25.833
- Zandar, you can't imagine
a horrible thing I've done

1:24:25.833 --> 1:24:29.125
as your king, but they made me do it.

1:24:29.125 --> 1:24:31.000
Fitna's been working to destroy us,

1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.916
and she's been using me
as her unwitting donkey.

1:24:33.916 --> 1:24:34.875
- What did he say?

1:24:34.875 --> 1:24:37.291
- Bull brother, bull bro, I discovered

1:24:37.291 --> 1:24:38.916
where they took your missing brother,

1:24:38.916 --> 1:24:41.708
and your son who's been
missing for so long.

1:24:41.708 --> 1:24:43.416
Your children are being held in cages.

1:24:43.416 --> 1:24:44.250
- What?

1:24:44.250 --> 1:24:46.916
- I've seen them myself
there with my own eyes.

1:24:46.916 --> 1:24:49.208
- Oh, where are they, please tell me.

1:24:49.208 --> 1:24:51.625
- Fitna, Fitna is the one holding them.

1:24:51.625 --> 1:24:54.083
They're all being held
in cages, her plan is

1:24:54.083 --> 1:24:56.750
to transport them to
the Ringmaster's circus.

1:24:56.750 --> 1:24:59.166
Though I found them, I
couldn't set them free.

1:24:59.166 --> 1:25:00.708
- What kind of madness is this?

1:25:00.708 --> 1:25:02.708
- The worst kind of madness,
she even has the king

1:25:02.708 --> 1:25:04.416
and Shazad locked up, too.

1:25:04.416 --> 1:25:06.416
- Wow, Mangu, (claps) wow.

1:25:06.416 --> 1:25:09.000
As a king, you're already a joke,

1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.250
but you just took it to the next level.

1:25:11.250 --> 1:25:12.541
(group laughs)

1:25:12.541 --> 1:25:14.041
- Brothers, you must believe me.

1:25:14.041 --> 1:25:15.458
We can't let them get away with it.

1:25:15.458 --> 1:25:18.458
- Why should we, have you done
anything to earn our trust?

1:25:18.458 --> 1:25:20.791
- We don't have time to
stand here and debate this.

1:25:20.791 --> 1:25:22.666
If we don't do something right away,

1:25:22.666 --> 1:25:26.041
Fitna's gonna turn those
animals into circus slaves.

1:25:26.041 --> 1:25:29.666
- Mangu, we should never
have made you king.

1:25:29.666 --> 1:25:32.583
It was the biggest mistake we made.

1:25:35.166 --> 1:25:39.750
- Maybe, maybe you're right,
but I am still the king now,

1:25:39.750 --> 1:25:43.000
and despite what you may
think, that won't change.

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.625
It's time for me to act like
the king you want me to be.

1:25:45.625 --> 1:25:47.625
I'm going on a rescue mission,

1:25:47.625 --> 1:25:50.208
even if I have to go all alone.

1:25:51.250 --> 1:25:52.708
- Then go.

1:25:52.708 --> 1:25:55.125
- Thanks for nothing, I'm out.

1:25:55.125 --> 1:25:56.416
- Hey, everyone, look,

1:25:56.416 --> 1:25:59.125
Mangu's finally acting like a real donkey.

1:25:59.125 --> 1:26:01.708
(group laughs)

1:26:02.875 --> 1:26:04.833
(horn honks)

1:26:04.833 --> 1:26:06.666
- They're on their way to the circus,

1:26:06.666 --> 1:26:08.916
but I'm the one who's gonna stop them.

1:26:08.916 --> 1:26:12.583
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:26:14.791 --> 1:26:15.625
- DK!

1:26:17.875 --> 1:26:19.291
- Save us, King, save us!
(overlapping chattering)

1:26:19.291 --> 1:26:22.625
(slow orchestral music)

1:26:37.708 --> 1:26:39.833
- Sir, did you happen
to see this video posted

1:26:39.833 --> 1:26:41.791
on Mangu's Facebook page?

1:26:41.791 --> 1:26:43.916
- Then Mangu is telling the truth?

1:26:43.916 --> 1:26:45.708
Get this story out immediately.

1:26:45.708 --> 1:26:47.541
- But this isn't evil news.

1:26:47.541 --> 1:26:49.375
- There are times for doing evil,

1:26:49.375 --> 1:26:53.166
and there are times for
doing what is so needed.

1:26:53.166 --> 1:26:54.625
Go and break the news.

1:26:54.625 --> 1:26:57.958
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:26:57.958 --> 1:27:02.083
- Fitna and the Ringmaster's
plan is exposed.

1:27:02.083 --> 1:27:05.583
Can the donkey king defeat
these villains all by himself?

1:27:05.583 --> 1:27:08.041
You gotta keep watching Monkey News.

1:27:08.041 --> 1:27:10.625
It's about our family today. (cries)

1:27:10.625 --> 1:27:13.291
Come on, we have to go help Mangu.

1:27:13.291 --> 1:27:15.000
- Mangu was right, we have to help.

1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000
Come on, now, get going.

1:27:19.541 --> 1:27:21.625
- [Mangu] No, no, no, no.

1:27:28.833 --> 1:27:31.666
(Mangu cries out)

1:27:33.583 --> 1:27:36.000
(horn honks)

1:27:38.958 --> 1:27:42.250
- My King, you need to
straddle the bike, it's safer.

1:27:42.250 --> 1:27:46.250
- But my pants are really
tight, they could rip.

1:27:48.833 --> 1:27:49.750
- Not good.

1:27:51.416 --> 1:27:52.416
- I got you.

1:28:01.875 --> 1:28:04.791
- Hey, is somebody cooking meatballs?

1:28:04.791 --> 1:28:07.791
Oh, no, it's me, I'm cooking.

1:28:07.791 --> 1:28:09.041
Oh, that's bad.

1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:12.833
- Yeah.

1:28:19.875 --> 1:28:22.083
- Excuse me, fun fact about cars.

1:28:22.083 --> 1:28:27.083
They often have two doors,
one on each side. (laughs)

1:28:30.125 --> 1:28:33.666
- It is a goal, the crowd goes wild.

1:28:33.666 --> 1:28:36.041
The crowd goes wild.

1:28:36.041 --> 1:28:37.291
- Mangu, Mangu!

1:28:45.583 --> 1:28:48.041
- What's going on, why is this happening?

1:28:48.041 --> 1:28:50.000
I was just minding my own business.

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:52.791
They're out to get me,
they're all out to get me.

1:28:52.791 --> 1:28:56.708
People tell me I'm
crazy, but obviously not.

1:28:56.708 --> 1:29:00.375
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:29:08.041 --> 1:29:11.291
- Let's go, ex king, give me your hand.

1:29:16.666 --> 1:29:19.583
(tires screeching)

1:29:21.125 --> 1:29:24.875
(whimsical orchestral music)

1:29:33.458 --> 1:29:36.791
- He's up, he's up, it's
going, he has done it again.

1:29:36.791 --> 1:29:39.041
The crowd goes totally wild.

1:29:39.041 --> 1:29:43.750
- Where have (mumbles) hijinks gotten to?

1:29:43.750 --> 1:29:48.750
- Go, stop the fox, now.
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:29:51.125 --> 1:29:52.291
(brakes screeching)

1:29:52.291 --> 1:29:53.125
- No.

1:29:53.125 --> 1:29:55.791
- [Super Dude] Shazad, Shazad!

1:29:55.791 --> 1:29:57.208
- Oh, no, no way.

1:29:59.291 --> 1:30:00.708
- [Shazad] Daddy!

1:30:07.958 --> 1:30:10.500
(Fitna laughs)

1:30:12.416 --> 1:30:15.250
(Mangu cries out)

1:30:19.666 --> 1:30:21.375
- [Mangu] Come on, Prince.

1:30:21.375 --> 1:30:22.208
- [Shazad] DK.

1:30:22.208 --> 1:30:24.000
- Give me your hand.

1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:26.666
- If you're asking for my
hand, you have to ask my dad.

1:30:26.666 --> 1:30:28.875
- I'm not trying to marry you, come on.

1:30:28.875 --> 1:30:31.333
Let's go, Shazad, come on, let's go.

1:30:31.333 --> 1:30:32.583
- Daddy, Daddy!

1:30:33.500 --> 1:30:35.833
- Shazad, this is a rescue.

1:30:35.833 --> 1:30:37.625
I've never seen anything like him.

1:30:37.625 --> 1:30:42.625
(Mangu cries out)
(ominous orchestral music)

1:30:51.458 --> 1:30:54.208
(Fitna growls)

1:30:54.208 --> 1:30:58.875
- What shall I feast on today,
donkey pie or donkey fry?

1:31:00.166 --> 1:31:01.750
- I prefer goodbye.

1:31:07.333 --> 1:31:10.708
(brakes screeching)

1:31:10.708 --> 1:31:13.208
(Fitna gasps)

1:31:13.208 --> 1:31:15.083
- That sure was a close one,
I could have been killed

1:31:15.083 --> 1:31:17.958
by that, but I'm okay now, huh?

1:31:17.958 --> 1:31:20.791
(Fitna cries out)

1:31:23.666 --> 1:31:25.500
- I need to invade your personal space.

1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:28.125
- [Shazad] Under no circumstance
are you to invade my--

1:31:28.125 --> 1:31:31.416
(Shazad cries out)

1:31:31.416 --> 1:31:35.333
- Oh, oh, oh. (screams)

1:31:35.333 --> 1:31:39.000
(dramatic orchestral music)

1:31:42.333 --> 1:31:45.291
(crowd gasps)

1:31:45.291 --> 1:31:49.208
(quiet overlapping chattering)

1:31:52.333 --> 1:31:54.625
- I know sometimes he can
be very inappropriate,

1:31:54.625 --> 1:31:57.125
but he died saving my life.

1:31:57.125 --> 1:32:00.375
- Mangu was good at heart, a good king.

1:32:07.250 --> 1:32:10.083
- Move out of my way
so I can see who died.

1:32:10.083 --> 1:32:12.375
Oh, no, darn. (cries)

1:32:12.375 --> 1:32:14.875
- My Lord, it was you we were mourning.

1:32:14.875 --> 1:32:16.791
How did you manage to escape?

1:32:16.791 --> 1:32:18.375
- Even though a shark tried to eat me,

1:32:18.375 --> 1:32:19.791
he decided against it.

1:32:19.791 --> 1:32:22.166
I guess he thought I was just too bony.

1:32:22.166 --> 1:32:23.875
(group laughs)

1:32:23.875 --> 1:32:26.458
(group cheers)

1:32:31.458 --> 1:32:34.958
Your Majesty, allow me
to return your crown.

1:32:34.958 --> 1:32:39.083
You see, I'm a donkey, that
is all I will ever need.

1:32:39.083 --> 1:32:43.250
- Mangu, the people of Azadnagar
chose you to be their king.

1:32:43.250 --> 1:32:46.916
That's a sacred bond that no
one can ever take from you.

1:32:46.916 --> 1:32:47.750
- Huh?

1:32:48.708 --> 1:32:50.041
- Not even me.

1:32:50.041 --> 1:32:52.541
(slow orchestral music)

1:32:52.541 --> 1:32:55.125
- Zandar, please, make
him try to understand.

1:32:55.125 --> 1:32:57.791
- I'd love to help you, but
I can't because he's right.

1:32:57.791 --> 1:33:00.875
The animals elected you, you
are the duly elected king.

1:33:00.875 --> 1:33:04.000
- How can I possibly run the
government all by myself?

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:06.125
- You don't have to, a government is run

1:33:06.125 --> 1:33:09.250
by more than a king,
it's run by many animals.

1:33:09.250 --> 1:33:11.583
- But where will I find all these animals?

1:33:11.583 --> 1:33:14.041
- They're all around you, Mangu,

1:33:14.041 --> 1:33:17.125
each one ready to serve if you pick them.

1:33:17.125 --> 1:33:19.166
- Zandar, I'm so confused.

1:33:19.166 --> 1:33:22.500
- It's like this, if your
ears were where your eyes are

1:33:22.500 --> 1:33:24.875
and your eyes where you have ears,

1:33:24.875 --> 1:33:28.208
nobody would be able to
see or hear anything.

1:33:28.208 --> 1:33:30.208
If you put the wrong person in a position

1:33:30.208 --> 1:33:34.041
that's wrong for them, then
nothing's ever going to work.

1:33:34.041 --> 1:33:35.625
- Oh, I get it now.

1:33:37.875 --> 1:33:40.875
In that case, I hereby state

1:33:40.875 --> 1:33:43.000
that you will be our
new Commander in Chief.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.875
No one would dare defy
my orders if they knew

1:33:44.875 --> 1:33:48.000
that you were around the palace.

1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.041
And you, Rapid?
- Good afternoon.

1:33:50.041 --> 1:33:52.166
- I'm now gonna make you
the Minister of Complaints.

1:33:52.166 --> 1:33:54.333
You have the patience
to listen to everyone.

1:33:54.333 --> 1:33:55.166
And you, Lando.

1:33:55.166 --> 1:33:56.000
- Pardon?

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.041
- You are in charge of
protecting our border.

1:33:58.041 --> 1:33:59.291
You'll be able to see the threats

1:33:59.291 --> 1:34:00.291
that come to us from afar.

1:34:00.291 --> 1:34:03.000
- You want a brand new car?

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:04.833
- You can see far.

1:34:04.833 --> 1:34:06.875
- Very smart, sir, with the right person

1:34:06.875 --> 1:34:09.458
in the right position, in no time at all,

1:34:09.458 --> 1:34:11.166
we'll be a new nation.

1:34:11.166 --> 1:34:13.916
- Super Dude, why didn't you tell me this?

1:34:13.916 --> 1:34:16.375
- I'll drop and give you 20 pushups, sir.

1:34:16.375 --> 1:34:17.375
- That's nonsense.

1:34:17.375 --> 1:34:19.041
- Thank you.

1:34:19.041 --> 1:34:20.916
- And in this new nation of ours,

1:34:20.916 --> 1:34:23.583
Monkey News shall speak no evil,

1:34:23.583 --> 1:34:28.083
hear no evil, and in the
future, we will show no evil.

1:34:29.666 --> 1:34:31.166
- Sir, the ratings?

1:34:31.166 --> 1:34:33.458
- I said forget the ratings.

1:34:33.458 --> 1:34:36.541
- Excuse me, excuse me,
can someone please tell me

1:34:36.541 --> 1:34:39.041
what there is for me to do around here?

1:34:39.041 --> 1:34:43.166
- Three jobs, entertainment,
entertainment, entertainment.

1:34:43.166 --> 1:34:48.125
(Shazad cheers)
(group laughs)

1:34:48.125 --> 1:34:51.333
Good people of Azad City, a few words.

1:34:51.333 --> 1:34:53.625
Lift your ears proudly and use your tails

1:34:53.625 --> 1:34:56.625
to whip the flies away because now,

1:34:56.625 --> 1:34:58.875
our nation is under donkey,

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.583
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:05.583
It's animal rule.
(upbeat orchestral music)

1:35:05.583 --> 1:35:08.166
(crowd cheers)

1:35:16.833 --> 1:35:20.333
- Okay, it's time for me to go, son.

1:35:20.333 --> 1:35:23.000
- But Father, how would
I do this without you?

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.291
- You don't need me anymore.

1:35:25.291 --> 1:35:30.041
You have proven that while you
may have been born a donkey,

1:35:30.041 --> 1:35:32.708
you are now a king.
(slow orchestral music)

1:35:32.708 --> 1:35:36.583
You'll be fine, just
wash behind your ears.

1:35:36.583 --> 1:35:40.416
- Huh?
(slow orchestral music)

1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.875
(upbeat drumming)

1:35:50.875 --> 1:35:54.000
- Three, two, one, yo, what's good?

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:57.500
It's your boy, Kenny Knox, and
I'm playing the donkey king,

1:35:57.500 --> 1:36:01.208
Mangu, we're here, day one,
you about to get started.

1:36:01.208 --> 1:36:03.458
I'm excited, probably be really fun.

1:36:03.458 --> 1:36:06.125
It's my first leading
role, it's animation.

1:36:06.125 --> 1:36:07.541
I always wanted to do animation.

1:36:07.541 --> 1:36:11.875
I'm excited, goodbye.
(upbeat music)

1:36:13.625 --> 1:36:15.125
- Day one, recording my voiceover.

1:36:15.125 --> 1:36:16.833
It's Mark Dohner, I'm playing Shazad.

1:36:16.833 --> 1:36:18.791
He's got the blue streak in his hair.

1:36:18.791 --> 1:36:23.291
I went with the pink, but
we'll see how it goes today.

1:36:25.625 --> 1:36:27.958
- [Production Assistant]
Okay, go ahead, do it.

1:36:27.958 --> 1:36:30.041
(Kenny brays)

1:36:30.041 --> 1:36:33.208
- I'm trying to make the donkey noise.

1:36:35.708 --> 1:36:36.791
- I look amazing.

1:36:36.791 --> 1:36:37.958
- [Fitna] Wow.

1:36:37.958 --> 1:36:39.166
- I look amazing?

1:36:39.166 --> 1:36:40.583
- [Production Assistant]
Yeah, there you go (mumbles).

1:36:40.583 --> 1:36:42.416
- How do you think I look, Miss Fitna?

1:36:42.416 --> 1:36:43.916
I look amazing?

1:36:43.916 --> 1:36:45.291
- [Fitna] Wow.

1:36:45.291 --> 1:36:46.625
- [Production Assistant]
Just be a little more excited

1:36:46.625 --> 1:36:48.791
about this, like he's proud of his--

1:36:48.791 --> 1:36:51.041
- How do you think I look, Miss Fitna?

1:36:51.041 --> 1:36:52.875
I look amazing, I look amazing?

1:36:52.875 --> 1:36:53.916
- [Production Assistant] Yeah, great.

1:36:53.916 --> 1:36:57.750
- How do you think I look,
Miss Fitna, I look amazing?

1:36:57.750 --> 1:37:00.500
- [Production Assistant] Perfect.

(Shazad laughs)

1:37:47.375 --> 1:37:49.125
- [Shazad] Miss Fitna, Miss Fitna,

1:37:49.125 --> 1:37:51.416
say it again, just one more time.

1:37:51.416 --> 1:37:54.833
(overlapping chattering)

1:37:56.666 --> 1:37:59.791
- Great day, day one is
wrapped, we in this thing.

1:37:59.791 --> 1:38:01.208
I'm onto day two.

1:38:05.083 --> 1:38:06.125
- That was really, really dope,

1:38:06.125 --> 1:38:07.875
really easy to work with the crew,

1:38:07.875 --> 1:38:08.958
and it was fun, I'm excited

1:38:08.958 --> 1:38:13.958
to hear how it sounds all
vocally produced and mixed, so.

1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:16.291
- [Interviewer] Can you explain
your character real quick?

1:38:16.291 --> 1:38:18.708
- Mangu is a donkey, he's a washerman.

1:38:18.708 --> 1:38:21.458
He's just a silly, a
really silly character,

1:38:21.458 --> 1:38:23.958
and he's about to become king.

1:38:25.208 --> 1:38:29.708
You gotta watch the movie,
you gotta see what happens.
