00:20.716 --> 00:22.083
Mmm...

00:22.117 --> 00:24.619
Mmm...

00:24.620 --> 00:25.953
You gotta wrap it up, Teddy.

00:25.954 --> 00:27.755
We're closing for the afternoon,

00:27.756 --> 00:30.391
but we'll be back in a few
hours for the dinner rush.

00:30.425 --> 00:31.893
I'm ready! Let's go!

00:31.927 --> 00:34.729
- Why do you have two bottles of wine?
- What? It's a wine train.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.297
Ooh. You guys going on the wine train?

00:36.298 --> 00:38.232
Uh, you get the wine
on the train, Lin.

00:38.233 --> 00:39.081
You don't have to bring it.

00:39.101 --> 00:40.501
Oh...

00:40.502 --> 00:42.303
Otherwise, it would be
just called a train.

00:42.304 --> 00:43.804
Right.

00:43.805 --> 00:45.506
Lin, you're sure kids
are allowed on this thing?

00:45.507 --> 00:48.109
It says right here in the brochure,
"Kids are allowed."

00:48.110 --> 00:51.145
It says, "Kids are allowed,
"but not welcome."

00:51.146 --> 00:52.613
Like in the health and sexuality
section at the bookstore.

00:52.614 --> 00:54.749
- Where's Gene?
- He's picking out his outfit.

00:55.784 --> 00:57.818
I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene!

00:57.819 --> 01:00.955
Gene, why do you look like Dexy
from Dexy's Midnight Runners?

01:00.989 --> 01:03.224
- 'Cause we're going on a train!
- Well, go put a shirt on.

01:03.225 --> 01:05.993
Next thing, you're gonna be telling me
to go put on underwear.

01:06.028 --> 01:06.961
Put on underwear.

01:06.962 --> 01:07.961
Okay.

01:11.099 --> 01:12.867
You folks will be seated right here

01:12.868 --> 01:15.136
in passenger car one
with the big grapes.

01:15.137 --> 01:17.772
And I'm gonna take these little
raisins back to the end of the vine.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.841
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye!

01:21.543 --> 01:23.678
Whoa!

01:23.679 --> 01:26.047
It's the biggest
chocolate fountain on a train

01:26.048 --> 01:27.548
in North and South America.

01:27.549 --> 01:29.784
The world's biggest is in Guatemala.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.286
I did not know chocolate
came from fountains.

01:32.321 --> 01:34.322
I want to put my head in it.
And my feet.

01:34.356 --> 01:37.225
Ethan, thank you very much
for the guided tour.

01:37.226 --> 01:39.861
Uh, looks like we'll be setting
up shop here for the day.

01:39.862 --> 01:41.062
For your troubles.

01:41.063 --> 01:42.296
Uh-uh, no-no-no-no-no,
no-no-no... no.

01:42.297 --> 01:43.331
Oh, here you go, one more for you.

01:43.332 --> 01:44.730
Uh, kids... no.
I'm sorry.

01:44.733 --> 01:46.033
Okay, one more for you.
Oh.

01:46.034 --> 01:47.134
Ye... actually, uh...
Thank you, Ethan.

01:47.135 --> 01:48.569
if you could put that down.

01:48.570 --> 01:51.672
Kids aren't allowed anywhere near
the buffet, or the passenger cars.

01:51.673 --> 01:56.310
But you are absolutely welcome to...
the Juice Caboose!

01:56.345 --> 01:57.812
Ugh, what a dump.

01:57.813 --> 01:58.679
Hey, there's someone there.

02:03.552 --> 02:04.685
Regular Sized Rudy?

02:04.720 --> 02:07.555
Louise, Gene, Tina...
what are you doing here?

02:07.556 --> 02:09.257
Hold on, Beanbag, I'll be right back.

02:09.258 --> 02:10.324
I know these guys from school.

02:10.359 --> 02:11.959
Um... do you live here?

02:11.994 --> 02:13.694
My dad has me on the weekends.

02:13.695 --> 02:15.930
He's been online dating
and he brings his dates here.

02:15.931 --> 02:19.167
But, on the bright side, I get to
hang out with ol' Beanbag here.

02:19.168 --> 02:20.468
Up top, Beanbag. Boom!

02:20.502 --> 02:21.802
Yep. We see a lot of Rudy.

02:24.339 --> 02:25.840
Okay... rules:

02:25.841 --> 02:28.409
One, you can't leave the Juice Caboose
for the duration of the trip.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.844
Two, don't bother me.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.547
And three, uh...
always believe in yourself.

02:32.581 --> 02:34.081
Thanks.
We can't leave the Juice Caboose?

02:34.082 --> 02:35.550
Are you kidding me?!

02:35.584 --> 02:38.719
Get comfy, 'cause this room is
your life for the next four hours.

02:38.754 --> 02:40.855
But there's nothing to do!

02:40.856 --> 02:42.089
Open this door!

02:43.058 --> 02:44.425
I can't hear you!

02:44.426 --> 02:46.093
The train's too loud... honk, honk.

02:46.094 --> 02:47.228
Honk, honk?!

02:47.229 --> 02:48.389
Trains don't make that noise!

02:56.772 --> 02:58.573
<i>All right,
this is gonna be great.</i>

02:58.607 --> 03:00.908
We have a babysitter
and a lot of alcohol.

03:00.909 --> 03:03.044
Wait, don't do...
No, don't do it!

03:03.045 --> 03:04.412
It's a tasting.

03:04.413 --> 03:06.047
You're supposed to swirl it around

03:06.048 --> 03:07.849
and shake the glass to
open it up, or something.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.383
Hey, open up, wine!

03:09.384 --> 03:10.384
Linda's coming in.

03:11.386 --> 03:13.054
Uh, okay.
Well, you do that.

03:13.055 --> 03:15.289
I'm just gonna drink a lot of wine.

03:20.229 --> 03:21.462
That guy must really know
what he's doing.

03:21.497 --> 03:23.030
Why, because he's slurping?

03:23.065 --> 03:24.065
Mm...

03:24.066 --> 03:25.500
Ugh! Oh, my.

03:25.501 --> 03:27.235
Excuse me! Hey! Hi!

03:27.236 --> 03:28.769
Are you some kind of an expert?

03:28.770 --> 03:31.072
I just overheard you
doing that sound...

03:31.106 --> 03:33.107
Oh. I'm a wine enthusiast.

03:33.108 --> 03:35.309
Although I'm not enthused
by this first flight.

03:35.344 --> 03:36.911
Oh! He's hysterical.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.312
You should come taste with us.

03:38.313 --> 03:40.314
Oh! You can give us tips
on how to get tipsy.

03:40.315 --> 03:41.816
Sure.
Lin, no.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.417
I don't want to drink with that guy.

03:43.452 --> 03:45.653
Why? I do, Bobby.
He's an expert.

03:45.687 --> 03:48.189
Well, I was looking forward
to a relaxing day off.

03:48.190 --> 03:50.992
I wasn't even gonna talk to you
that much, to be honest.

03:50.993 --> 03:52.960
I just don't want to
drink with the guy...

03:52.995 --> 03:54.762
Hi... Look who's here?
I'm Rick.

03:54.797 --> 03:57.365
I love Italian wines, German
cars and Japanese women.

03:57.366 --> 03:58.366
I'm Linda!

03:58.367 --> 04:01.669
I love showers and mornings
and bologna and turtles.

04:01.670 --> 04:02.669
And wine!

04:02.671 --> 04:03.804
I'm Bob.

04:03.805 --> 04:06.374
Well, it looks like
we are going to be

04:06.375 --> 04:08.342
a tasting trio for the afternoon.

04:08.343 --> 04:09.877
<i>Jambo.</i>
It means cheers.

04:09.878 --> 04:10.711
Cheers!

04:10.712 --> 04:11.813
"Cheers!"

04:11.814 --> 04:13.481
Come on, Bob.

04:13.482 --> 04:15.316
If we don't clink,
it's not a real <i> Jambo.</i>

04:15.317 --> 04:16.317
Mm-hmm.
<i>Jambo!</i>

04:16.317 --> 04:17.351
<i>Jambo.
Jambo...!</i>

04:17.351 --> 04:18.351
<i>Jambo...!</i>

04:18.353 --> 04:19.754
<i>Jambo...!</i>
Uh, okay.

04:19.788 --> 04:21.122
- Jambo...!
- Jambo...!

04:21.123 --> 04:22.190
<i>No more</i> Jambo.

04:24.293 --> 04:25.827
Usually I'm by myself,
but since you guys are here,

04:25.828 --> 04:27.309
maybe we could take turns
sitting on Beanbag.

04:27.329 --> 04:28.796
Is that okay with you, Beanbag?

04:28.831 --> 04:31.833
Rudy, how can you just sit there,
when there's a chocolate fountain

04:31.834 --> 04:35.136
behind this door being unappreciated
by a bunch of drunk adults?

04:35.137 --> 04:37.138
It's being wasted on the wasted!

04:37.139 --> 04:38.528
There's got to be a way out of here.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.540
There's a hatch in the ceiling.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.541
Here, give me a boost.

04:43.512 --> 04:45.146
Ahh...! It's hot!

04:45.147 --> 04:46.214
Bad idea! Bad idea!

04:46.215 --> 04:48.182
- Put me down!
- Okay.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.017
Thank you.

04:50.018 --> 04:51.419
Okay. Nobody panic.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.854
We're only in here for two hours.

04:52.855 --> 04:53.855
Four hours.

04:54.990 --> 04:55.989
Four hours!

04:55.991 --> 04:57.959
<i>"Four hours...!"</i>

05:06.335 --> 05:09.003
Oh, my God. You know, if you ever
want to get serious about wine,

05:09.004 --> 05:10.638
you really have to lose the mustache.

05:10.672 --> 05:12.373
True, 'cause it gets
all caught up in there.

05:12.374 --> 05:13.774
Mm-hmm.
That makes sense.

05:13.775 --> 05:15.523
- Yeah.
Pee-ew!

05:15.544 --> 05:17.211
Be a lot easier if you just shaved it.

05:17.246 --> 05:19.180
I'd rather not, Rick.
I'm not shaving it.

05:19.181 --> 05:20.648
I didn't bring shaving equipment.

05:20.682 --> 05:22.350
Bobby, quit being a pinot grouchio!

05:24.753 --> 05:28.856
Look, I'm perfectly happy enjoying
my wine, staring out the window

05:28.891 --> 05:32.693
at that... kid on a bike,
going the same speed as us?

05:32.728 --> 05:34.529
And we are friends.

05:34.530 --> 05:35.997
I call him Ramon.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.031
Hi, Ramon!

05:37.032 --> 05:38.032
What?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.267
Hi!

05:39.268 --> 05:40.201
I can't hear you.

05:40.202 --> 05:42.870
What? I... I
can't hear you.

05:42.871 --> 05:43.938
I'm in a train.

05:43.939 --> 05:45.806
Okay, have a nice bike ride.

05:45.807 --> 05:46.874
Whoa.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.043
Ramon just threw a rock at me.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.077
We're still friends.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.382
What kind of God would put a
chocolate fountain on a train

05:54.383 --> 05:55.716
and not let kids near it?!

05:55.717 --> 05:58.019
Yeah! Learn how to build a train, God!

05:58.053 --> 06:00.221
Well... the chocolate fountain
is impressive,

06:00.222 --> 06:02.256
but the real supply's
all the way up front.

06:02.291 --> 06:04.192
What do you mean, "The real supply?"

06:04.226 --> 06:06.260
There's way more chocolate
up in the kitchen.

06:06.261 --> 06:08.462
I've seen them load
boxes and boxes of it in there.

06:08.497 --> 06:11.132
Well, then, are you guys
thinking what I'm thinking?

06:11.133 --> 06:12.300
That I need a bath?

06:12.301 --> 06:13.301
Oh, yeah. You do.

06:13.302 --> 06:14.902
No. We break out of here

06:14.903 --> 06:16.470
and steal the chocolate
from the front of the train!

06:16.471 --> 06:17.471
I'd do that.

06:17.472 --> 06:18.639
I'm in.
Great!

06:18.640 --> 06:20.341
The Belcher kids ride again!

06:20.342 --> 06:21.943
For the first time!

06:21.944 --> 06:23.627
And Rudy! Is there.

06:25.876 --> 06:27.978
<i>Okay, if we're gonna
rob this train,</i>

06:28.012 --> 06:29.679
we need to take it step by step.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.614
Luckily, Rudy has been
trapped in this caboose

06:31.615 --> 06:33.984
for the last nine weekends
doing some serious recon.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.952
I see everything out this window.

06:35.953 --> 06:38.221
Once, a skunk got on the train for
a little bit and then it got off

06:38.222 --> 06:39.589
and I was the only one to notice.

06:39.623 --> 06:41.024
Just take us through
the logistics, Train Brain.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.225
Okay.

06:42.259 --> 06:44.227
Each of these blocks is a train car.

06:44.228 --> 06:46.029
This is taking too long!
I need chocolate!

06:46.030 --> 06:47.063
Gene, quiet.

06:47.064 --> 06:50.367
Sorry. It's okay. Now, this is
us here in the Juice Caboose.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.901
I can see us in there.

06:51.902 --> 06:52.902
Just kidding.
We're not inside a block.

06:52.903 --> 06:54.371
Tina!
Okay.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.773
The only time the door
to the caboose in unlocked,

06:56.807 --> 06:58.208
<i>is when Ethan makes
a juice box delivery,</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.509
<i>every hour on the hour.</i>

06:59.543 --> 07:00.744
<i>Every hour on the hour.</i>

07:00.745 --> 07:02.112
<i>Sounds like a robot.</i>

07:02.146 --> 07:04.280
Wait! What if Ethan is a robot!?

07:04.281 --> 07:05.749
Gene! Focus!

07:05.750 --> 07:07.317
You guys are embarrassing me.

07:07.318 --> 07:09.085
In front of Rudy, which is hard!

07:09.086 --> 07:11.254
Even if we get out of here,

07:11.255 --> 07:13.523
<i>you still have to get all the
way up to the kitchen car.</i>

07:13.557 --> 07:14.824
<i>The chocolate is kept inside</i>

07:14.825 --> 07:16.226
<i>the chocolatier's refrigerator.</i>

07:16.227 --> 07:17.727
<i>He's from Germany.</i>

07:17.728 --> 07:19.162
<i>The chocolate's from Switzerland.</i>

07:19.163 --> 07:20.597
<i>- We're from America.</i>
- Yeah...!

07:20.631 --> 07:22.232
<i>Now, the only time
the kitchen is empty</i>

07:22.233 --> 07:23.933
<i>is when it's a passenger's birthday</i>

07:23.934 --> 07:25.935
<i>and the whole staff comes out to sing</i>

07:25.936 --> 07:28.238
<i>the "Chugga Chugga Choo Choo
Happy Birthday To You" song.</i>

07:28.272 --> 07:30.106
So, we know how to get in,
but how do we get out?

07:30.107 --> 07:32.442
I think I know how,
but it's a little dangerous.

07:32.443 --> 07:35.111
Like sandwiches with
toothpicks in them dangerous?

07:35.112 --> 07:36.980
Even more dangerous than that.

07:36.981 --> 07:38.148
Like eating a bomb?

07:38.149 --> 07:39.115
In between.

07:39.116 --> 07:40.650
Like eating a firecracker.

07:40.651 --> 07:41.818
Yeah. Okay.

07:41.819 --> 07:44.354
Here's what we're gonna do.

07:44.355 --> 07:45.422
Well... aren't you kids playing nice.

07:45.456 --> 07:47.991
Hey, Ethan,
over here.

07:48.025 --> 07:49.759
Look at my face and hands
while I'm talking.

07:49.794 --> 07:52.195
I just want you to know
it's my mom's birthday today.

07:52.196 --> 07:54.297
Um, it isn't June 3, it's today. Okay.

07:54.298 --> 07:55.565
Wait, I have some questions for you.

07:55.599 --> 07:56.599
Uh-huh.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.868
Um, what does "Ethan" mean?
Um...

07:58.869 --> 08:00.670
Sounds like how Shakespeare
Huh?

08:00.705 --> 08:02.138
So, maybe that's
where it comes from?

08:02.173 --> 08:03.006
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.

08:03.007 --> 08:06.209
Next question, uh... if a train
leaves New York at 4:00,

08:06.210 --> 08:09.145
and another train leaves Dallas at
5:00, what time will they meet?

08:09.146 --> 08:10.780
Uh...

08:10.815 --> 08:12.215
Great. Well,
I'm kind of busy right now,

08:12.216 --> 08:13.483
so I'm gonna have to let you go.

08:13.484 --> 08:14.684
Have fun at my mom's birthday. Bye.

08:14.685 --> 08:16.019
Uh... do you want juice?!

08:16.020 --> 08:18.722
No! Uh, maybe...
uh, ye... no, ye... ahh...!

08:18.723 --> 08:20.750
Mm. I like this one.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.993
Ugh! You think you do, but you don't.

08:23.994 --> 08:25.462
What do I think of this wine?

08:25.463 --> 08:26.830
Great question.
Here's what you think.

08:26.831 --> 08:27.830
Hey, Ethan.

08:27.832 --> 08:28.832
How's Rudy?

08:28.833 --> 08:30.200
How's Beanbag?

08:30.201 --> 08:31.501
Uh, they're great.
Beanbag's great.

08:31.502 --> 08:33.068
Rudy's such a delight.

08:33.070 --> 08:34.804
I just dropped off some
juice for them.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.306
Can I get a cranberry juice?

08:36.340 --> 08:37.474
Uh-oh...

08:37.508 --> 08:40.309
Coming right up.
Um, who's Rudy?

08:40.311 --> 08:42.178
- He's my son.
- You have a son?

08:42.179 --> 08:44.014
Mandy, you know, I might
have left a little information

08:44.048 --> 08:46.883
off my E-Kiss profile, but
that was just for readability.

08:46.884 --> 08:49.152
So, you look nothing
like your profile picture

08:49.153 --> 08:50.720
and you have a son?
Uh-huh.

08:50.755 --> 08:52.155
Okay.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.023
So, your face
is saying one thing...

08:53.024 --> 08:53.890
No. No.
I love kids.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.025
Okay.
Will you ma...

08:55.059 --> 08:56.593
I love kids.
Can you make eye contact with me?

08:56.594 --> 08:58.595
I am. Aren't I? No.
You're looking at my chin.

08:58.596 --> 09:00.196
No. That's, that's your... I'll just
get below here. How 'bout now?

09:00.197 --> 09:01.765
No. Na... I have a son.
Are you cool with that?

09:01.766 --> 09:02.876
I gotta take a nap.
Okay.

09:04.535 --> 09:05.534
Whew!

09:05.536 --> 09:06.903
Oh, there it is.
Here you go.

09:08.372 --> 09:10.040
We've got a birthday, people.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.040
Places. Ready?

09:11.042 --> 09:12.075
Here we go, everyone.

09:12.109 --> 09:13.777
Five, six, seven and...

09:13.778 --> 09:15.812
Everybody watch your back

09:15.846 --> 09:18.281
the birthday train is on the track!

09:23.020 --> 09:25.188
Well, hello, there.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.723
Put some wine in your glass,

09:26.724 --> 09:29.459
'cause your life is
moving fast, so drink your day away.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.027
Honk, honk!

09:31.028 --> 09:32.395
What's happening?!
It's not my...

09:32.430 --> 09:34.230
Happy Birthday, Linda!

09:34.231 --> 09:36.566
Oh, it <i> is</i> my birthday...

09:36.600 --> 09:38.134
Don't worry,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

09:38.135 --> 09:39.636
Yay!

09:39.637 --> 09:40.637
And then I'm gonna eat you.

09:40.638 --> 09:41.705
No...!

09:41.706 --> 09:43.041
Shush!

09:43.074 --> 09:44.107
Where is she?

09:44.108 --> 09:45.775
She should be out there by now!

09:45.810 --> 09:47.844
Who's that?

09:47.878 --> 09:50.447
I don't know... it's too early
for Ethan to come back.

09:50.448 --> 09:51.548
Aah! I'm not decent!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.683
Come back later!
Thank you!

09:53.718 --> 09:55.852
I must use the kerplunker!

09:55.886 --> 09:56.886
There's a line for the other one.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.987
Make it fast.

09:57.988 --> 09:59.122
Don't tell me, make it fast.

09:59.123 --> 10:00.123
Just go.

10:00.124 --> 10:01.124
Don't tell me, just go.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.125
Just da... ah...

10:02.126 --> 10:03.126
Make some noise.

10:03.127 --> 10:04.594
Sing songs or something.

10:04.595 --> 10:05.729
Look, look... look at the
legs on the glass.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.730
You see the legs?

10:06.764 --> 10:08.264
I see fe... it looks like feet.

10:08.299 --> 10:09.666
Oh, Linda.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.934
You're such a sweet, simple person.

10:10.935 --> 10:12.902
Thanks.
Wait, what?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.572
Look, Rick, you're not
the only person with taste.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.207
We happen to own a restaurant.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.275
Whoa-ho! It's not a competition, Bob.

10:19.276 --> 10:20.744
I didn't say it was.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.845
Sounds like this guy
wants to have a wine-off!

10:21.846 --> 10:23.246
What?!

10:23.280 --> 10:24.814
Wine-off? Ooh, wine-off.

10:24.815 --> 10:26.449
Wine-off.
Wine-off.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.450
There's gonna be a wine-off.

10:27.451 --> 10:28.852
We got a wine-off!

10:28.853 --> 10:31.121
Oh, my goodness.
It's going down.

10:31.155 --> 10:33.523
Hey... oh, s...
Sorry, sorry. Uh, da, da, da.

10:33.524 --> 10:35.191
Too soon? Too...
too much? Don't. Yeah, just...

10:35.192 --> 10:37.193
<i>My</i> space.
I thought the train was crashing.

10:37.194 --> 10:38.628
Sorry. Trying to save you.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.767
Whew. Okay, this is scarier
than I thought.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.368
Uh, no big deal, Louise.

10:45.369 --> 10:46.803
Just jump off a moving train.

10:46.837 --> 10:50.673
Come on.
One, two, three!

10:50.674 --> 10:52.609
Wow.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.244
That train is not moving very fast.

10:54.278 --> 10:56.346
This window won't open.

10:56.347 --> 10:58.283
That's why we need
to get back in there.

10:58.315 --> 10:59.649
Could pick up the pace.

10:59.650 --> 11:01.051
You're not going fast enough.

11:01.052 --> 11:02.619
I am too going fast enough.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.555
No job is done until the
paperwork is complete.

11:05.556 --> 11:06.856
Stand by.

11:06.891 --> 11:10.360
Where the hell is Rudy?

11:10.394 --> 11:11.895
Okay.

11:11.896 --> 11:13.797
Oh, boy! Oh, oh...
Oh, wow...

11:13.798 --> 11:16.366
It's not that bad.
You're making a big deal. Wow.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.967
You're making... Come on.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.636
It's like my grandpa.
It's not that bad.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.671
Where the hell have you been?
Pull me up.

11:21.705 --> 11:24.007
Hand me the chocolate
and then I'll pull you up.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.475
Hand you the chocolates?

11:25.509 --> 11:27.010
Yeah.
And then I'll pull you up.

11:27.044 --> 11:29.179
How do I know that once
I hand you the chocolate

11:29.180 --> 11:32.182
you're not gonna just leave me
out here and take the chocolate?

11:32.183 --> 11:34.317
I wouldn't do that.
That's what I would do.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.087
That's so mean.
Look, if you don't take this chocolate

11:37.088 --> 11:39.422
and leave me out here,
then I can't work with you.

11:39.423 --> 11:41.725
Please give me the chocolate
so I can pull you up.

11:41.726 --> 11:43.693
Fine.

11:43.728 --> 11:44.894
Okay, Gene.

11:44.895 --> 11:46.229
You hold onto me. Got it.

11:46.230 --> 11:47.864
Tina, you hold onto me.
Great.

11:47.865 --> 11:49.299
And then I'll hold onto
something in the bathroom.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.202
And pretend it's a person
holding onto me.

11:52.203 --> 11:53.838
Like a boy or an 18-year-old boy.

11:53.871 --> 11:56.039
Okay.
We're ready.

11:56.073 --> 11:57.072
Ah... no.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.888
Bang-up job, everybody.

12:11.889 --> 12:13.690
We got the chocolate in the caboose.

12:13.691 --> 12:14.924
Like we planned.

12:14.925 --> 12:17.861
The only problem is is that
we are not in the caboose!

12:17.862 --> 12:19.095
At least we have toilet paper.

12:19.096 --> 12:20.363
You guys want any?

12:20.364 --> 12:21.574
Thank you.

12:23.006 --> 12:24.273
Ugh!

12:24.274 --> 12:25.495
Well, we're stranded.

12:25.508 --> 12:27.075
Our chocolate's on the train,

12:27.076 --> 12:28.911
and there's nothing
around here for miles.

12:28.912 --> 12:30.979
My boy-dar isn't picking up
anything, either.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.181
Oh, wait...
no, that's a deer.

12:33.182 --> 12:35.984
We've got to get back to that
chocolate before somebody else does.

12:36.019 --> 12:37.286
Guys, we're gonna be okay.

12:37.287 --> 12:38.520
The train's coming right back here.

12:38.521 --> 12:40.122
Wait, what? The train goes down,

12:40.123 --> 12:42.324
goes around Lake Waste Water,
and comes right back.

12:42.325 --> 12:44.393
It should back in 15 minutes,
so we should just jump on it.

12:44.427 --> 12:46.028
But when is Ethan gonna stop by

12:46.029 --> 12:47.462
the Juice Caboose
with his next delivery?

12:47.497 --> 12:49.331
Let me check my watch.

12:49.332 --> 12:51.400
In exactly...  15 minutes!

12:51.434 --> 12:53.106
This is gonna be close.

12:54.804 --> 12:56.038
Mmm.

12:56.039 --> 12:57.306
Speak to me.

12:57.307 --> 12:59.107
You're hiding from me.

12:59.108 --> 13:00.475
I'll find you.

13:00.476 --> 13:02.678
Ooh...

13:02.679 --> 13:04.713
You have got a lot
goin' on here, girl.

13:04.714 --> 13:05.981
Ugh.

13:05.982 --> 13:07.849
Ah, there you are.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.785
A California Central Coast Syrah.

13:09.819 --> 13:11.053
Okay, Bobby.

13:11.054 --> 13:12.321
Now you taste your wine.

13:14.857 --> 13:18.060
This one is probably...
wine.

13:18.061 --> 13:19.328
I would say red.

13:19.329 --> 13:20.829
Or it could be white.

13:20.830 --> 13:24.499
I'm also realizing that I'm not as
good at this as I thought I'd be.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.734
No, you're not.

13:25.735 --> 13:27.336
Chablis is a wine, right?

13:27.337 --> 13:28.837
You guys aren't answering me.

13:28.838 --> 13:30.405
I'm gonna say that's a good sign.

13:30.406 --> 13:32.307
I'm going with Chablis.

13:32.308 --> 13:34.042
Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby.

13:34.043 --> 13:35.877
You're not good at this. Poor Bob.

13:35.912 --> 13:38.747
I can't see your sad, pathetic face
right now, but I bet it's crying.

13:38.748 --> 13:40.515
I'll tell you what.
Linda, pick any wine.

13:40.516 --> 13:42.818
It can even be a wine he knows.
Any wine?

13:42.819 --> 13:44.219
If you can get one wine right,

13:44.220 --> 13:46.188
just one,
you win the whole competition.

13:46.189 --> 13:48.690
In fact, you could pick a wine
he had last night.

13:48.691 --> 13:50.359
I'll still know it before he does.

13:50.393 --> 13:52.361
Ooh, bonus round.

13:52.362 --> 13:54.329
Whoever says what it is first, wins.

13:54.364 --> 13:55.831
What's the point?

13:55.832 --> 13:56.999
You can do this, Bobby.

13:57.033 --> 13:58.000
No, I can't.

13:58.001 --> 13:58.834
Look at me, Bobby.

13:58.868 --> 13:59.668
I-I can't.

13:59.669 --> 14:00.669
Yes you can.

14:00.703 --> 14:01.837
I have a blindfold on.

14:01.838 --> 14:04.473
Well, you can do
the mystery wine.

14:04.507 --> 14:06.041
All right, fine.
Pour it.

14:06.042 --> 14:07.276
At least I'll get drunk-ish.

14:07.277 --> 14:08.810
That's it, Bobby.

14:08.845 --> 14:10.345
Hey, look what's coming
around the mountain.

14:10.346 --> 14:11.647
The train.

14:11.681 --> 14:13.448
Just kidding about the mountain, uh,

14:13.449 --> 14:15.384
but the train is...
remember that song?

14:15.385 --> 14:17.085
Uh-oh.
Guys, she's coming back faster.

14:17.086 --> 14:19.788
This only happens when the
train's running behind schedule

14:19.789 --> 14:22.557
or this one time when they ran out
of rosé and things got weird.

14:22.558 --> 14:25.827
It's starting to look
kind of like a real train now.

14:25.862 --> 14:27.863
Like fast, and dangerous.

14:27.864 --> 14:29.531
We could just get a cab.
Oh, look, there's Ethan.

14:29.565 --> 14:31.667
He's headed toward
the Juice Caboose!

14:31.701 --> 14:33.001
We need to jump on now, guys.

14:33.036 --> 14:34.269
Come on.

14:36.039 --> 14:37.539
Hobos do this everyday.

14:37.540 --> 14:38.753
I don't understand it.

14:38.775 --> 14:40.042
Cliff!

14:40.043 --> 14:41.410
You think my name is Cliff?

14:41.411 --> 14:42.644
Oh, my God, I love it.

14:42.645 --> 14:43.912
I'm Cliff now.
Call me Cliff.

14:43.913 --> 14:45.180
No, just to clarify:

14:45.214 --> 14:47.053
Cliff!

14:48.318 --> 14:50.223
We have to
get on that train now!

14:50.253 --> 14:52.254
We're running out of dry land!

14:57.961 --> 14:59.394
I have to go back
for my bandana.

14:59.429 --> 15:01.930
It's made of cotton!
Leave it!

15:01.965 --> 15:03.398
Leave it!

15:03.433 --> 15:05.367
Oh, damn it!

15:06.402 --> 15:07.436
You chose chocolate.

15:07.470 --> 15:08.804
It's what your bandana

15:08.805 --> 15:10.605
I guess.

15:18.982 --> 15:21.817
Oh, no. Now my
overalls are stuck.

15:21.818 --> 15:23.318
What's going on with my outfit?

15:23.353 --> 15:25.687
Do something, Gene!
He's almost here!

15:25.688 --> 15:27.343
Aah! We have to hide
the chocolate. Oh...

15:27.357 --> 15:29.124
Where are we going to hide it?

15:29.125 --> 15:30.392
I don't know.

15:30.426 --> 15:31.994
Oh, no.

15:32.028 --> 15:33.295
Oh, no!

15:33.329 --> 15:35.797
Oh, boy. Oh, oh...

15:35.832 --> 15:38.271
Oh, boy, oh, boy! Ow.

15:38.301 --> 15:41.069
Hey, kiddies. Got your juice.

15:41.104 --> 15:43.038
Oh, thanks, Ethan.
Thanks so much, buddy.

15:43.039 --> 15:46.642
We can always count on you for juice
and juice-related things and...

15:46.643 --> 15:48.510
really just juice.
But we love juice.

15:49.512 --> 15:51.480
Are you kids okay?

15:51.514 --> 15:53.315
Oh, we're just great, thanks.

15:53.316 --> 15:54.650
Last juice of the day.

15:54.684 --> 15:56.652
Great.
Uh, cran-apple?

15:56.686 --> 15:58.387
Wait a minute.
Something's up.

15:58.388 --> 15:59.667
Why are you out of breath?

15:59.689 --> 16:01.056
Well, my trachea constricts

16:01.057 --> 16:02.457
due to histamines
that my body produces...

16:02.492 --> 16:04.526
Okay, okay, Rudy, stop talking.

16:04.527 --> 16:05.927
Why are your shoes muddy?

16:05.962 --> 16:07.396
Because I'm-I'm poor.

16:07.397 --> 16:08.634
Oh, I'm so poor.

16:08.665 --> 16:10.136
And why are you in your underwear?

16:10.166 --> 16:11.804
Because I am rich.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.468
There's been a burglary.

16:13.469 --> 16:15.504
Somebody stole my chocolate!

16:15.505 --> 16:17.205
I am very shocked by that.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.137
Okay, what was rule number two?

16:20.138 --> 16:21.606
Always believe in yourself?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.040
No! Don't bother me.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.475
Stealing is bothering.

16:24.476 --> 16:26.877
Nobody steals anything
on my shift. Yeah!

16:26.878 --> 16:29.113
Wha... we've been locked
in here all day.

16:29.147 --> 16:31.382
I don't buy it.
I don't buy it, either.

16:31.383 --> 16:33.826
I think I know who likes chocolate.

16:33.852 --> 16:34.685
Everybody.

16:34.686 --> 16:36.153
Yes, right.

16:36.154 --> 16:37.622
But especially kids.

16:37.656 --> 16:41.225
I heard this one say she wants to
put her face and her feet in it.

16:41.226 --> 16:42.493
I stand by that.

16:42.494 --> 16:43.994
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

16:43.995 --> 16:46.263
Would you be dumb enough
to hide it in here?

16:46.264 --> 16:47.998
I guess you're dumb enough to think

16:47.999 --> 16:49.600
we <i> would</i> hide it in there, Ethan.

16:49.601 --> 16:50.968
Yeah, you gorgeous idiot.

16:51.002 --> 16:54.138
Or maybe you kids
hid it in the bathroom.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.641
Whew...!
Eh, maybe give it a minute in there.

16:56.675 --> 16:57.725
It's not in there.

16:59.177 --> 17:00.311
Get up, Rudy.

17:00.345 --> 17:01.512
N-No.

17:01.513 --> 17:03.080
Beans didn't do anything.

17:03.081 --> 17:04.315
He doesn't have a
malicious bean in his bag.

17:04.348 --> 17:05.483
No!

17:05.517 --> 17:06.517
No!

17:06.518 --> 17:09.153
Don't you touch Beanbag!

17:09.186 --> 17:10.054
No!

17:10.055 --> 17:11.856
All right!
Bonus round.

17:11.857 --> 17:13.257
Winner takes all.

17:13.258 --> 17:16.035
Ready...
and drink.

17:17.396 --> 17:18.628
I know what it is.

17:18.630 --> 17:20.455
Oh, you know?
From one sip.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.465
Yep.
So Bob knows it.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.934
Say it. I'll give you a chance here.

17:23.935 --> 17:25.169
You take a guess.

17:25.203 --> 17:27.128
Oh, he's giving Rick a chance.

17:30.275 --> 17:31.542
You don't know it.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.578
Talk to me, Goose.

17:34.579 --> 17:35.946
Get inside me.

17:35.947 --> 17:37.214
Take your shoes off.

17:37.215 --> 17:38.891
Make yourself comfortable.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.885
The wine's inside of Rick.

17:40.886 --> 17:42.103
Getting comfortable.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.088
Okay.
It's a blend...

17:44.089 --> 17:45.890
Yeah, it's definitely a blend.

17:45.891 --> 17:47.458
I'm getting a few things here.

17:47.459 --> 17:48.793
It's very complex.

17:48.794 --> 17:50.027
Take another sip, Rick.

17:50.061 --> 17:52.113
This is gettin' good.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.331
Oh, I guess I was wrong.

17:54.332 --> 17:56.267
I hope you're happy.
He was beautiful.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.501
Well, whatever.

17:57.502 --> 17:58.953
Enjoy the rest of your ride.

17:58.970 --> 18:00.237
I'll go check the busboys.

18:00.238 --> 18:01.747
Somebody has the chocolate.

18:06.511 --> 18:08.679
Hey, uh... I'm sorry you kids
had to see that.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.506
But, uh... it's a hard life
on the rails.

18:10.515 --> 18:12.082
Yup, yup, so true.
So wise.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.284
You should teach a class.
Bye!

18:13.318 --> 18:14.317
I should.

18:15.587 --> 18:17.555
You guys sure you don't
want any more juice?

18:17.589 --> 18:19.515
We don't want any more juice.
Get out of here, Ethan.

18:19.524 --> 18:20.958
Okay, okay.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.326
See you next week, Rudy.
We cool?

18:22.360 --> 18:23.360
Yeah, yeah.
We're cool.

18:23.361 --> 18:24.962
Just go.
All right.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.163
Doesn't sound like we're cool.

18:26.198 --> 18:28.149
We're cool!
Okay, bye.

18:30.268 --> 18:33.104
Everybody, open your mouths.

18:34.339 --> 18:36.740
Delicious.

18:36.775 --> 18:38.342
It's so delicious.

18:38.343 --> 18:40.144
Num, num, num...
Pace yourself. Pace yourself.

18:41.346 --> 18:42.646
Who are you?

18:42.647 --> 18:43.881
I know we've met.

18:43.882 --> 18:45.124
You're embarrassing me.

18:45.150 --> 18:46.684
All right, Rick.
Stop stalling.

18:46.685 --> 18:49.353
Fine.
It's very viscous.

18:49.354 --> 18:52.857
It's a...
Cab-Merlot blend.

18:52.858 --> 18:54.125
Okay, okay, okay.

18:54.126 --> 18:56.761
Bob, do you know what the wine is?

18:56.795 --> 18:58.195
It <i> is</i> a blend.

18:58.196 --> 18:59.697
But it's a blend of spit.

18:59.698 --> 19:01.799
Because it's from
the spit bucket! What?

19:01.833 --> 19:03.534
He's right.
Bobby wins.

19:03.568 --> 19:05.836
What?! You drank spit, Rick.

19:05.837 --> 19:07.838
You drank a lot of it. What?

19:07.839 --> 19:09.206
You poured that from the spit bucket?

19:09.207 --> 19:10.508
Why did you do that?

19:10.509 --> 19:12.309
Because I knew Bob
would know what it was.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.644
Why would Bob know that?

19:13.678 --> 19:15.379
Because we went to see <i> Sideways,</i>

19:15.380 --> 19:18.649
and after that we went to the wine
bar and I bet Bob he wouldn't drink

19:18.650 --> 19:20.284
from the spit bucket and he did.

19:20.318 --> 19:21.552
That's disgusting.

19:22.988 --> 19:24.688
And that's how you win a wine-off.

19:24.689 --> 19:26.223
Ah!

19:26.258 --> 19:28.058
Wine fight!

19:28.059 --> 19:29.979
No, no, no.
Not the jacket.

19:29.995 --> 19:32.505
Not-not the turtleneck, it's cashmere.

19:32.531 --> 19:34.999
That's for lying on your profile.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.233
I'm sorry.

19:36.234 --> 19:37.735
Look, I'm a middle-aged man

19:37.736 --> 19:40.037
who's just trying to get
back out there and...

19:40.038 --> 19:41.772
Mandy, I really like you.

19:41.773 --> 19:43.774
That's for making me fall for you.

19:45.343 --> 19:46.944
Aw, they're in love.

19:46.945 --> 19:48.270
Ah, my face!

19:49.681 --> 19:52.349
We got our very own
chocolate fountain!

19:52.350 --> 19:53.784
Some of it just went
down my underwear.

19:53.785 --> 19:55.052
I like it.

19:55.053 --> 19:56.854
This is the best weekend of my life.

19:56.855 --> 19:59.356
It doesn't even matter that
I'm allergic to chocolate.

19:59.357 --> 20:00.591
Rudy, what?

20:00.592 --> 20:01.959
Ugh, stop eating it, then.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.394
Oh, 'cause I'm allergic to it?

20:03.395 --> 20:05.296
Yeah, what happens when you eat it?

20:05.297 --> 20:06.564
I don't know, I've never eaten it.

20:06.565 --> 20:08.933
I don't know what...

20:08.934 --> 20:11.435
Rudy! Rudy!

20:11.436 --> 20:12.736
Just kidding.

20:12.737 --> 20:14.238
Damn it, Rudy.
It's not that bad.

20:14.239 --> 20:15.639
I just get a rash on my back.

20:18.977 --> 20:20.444
There's my babies.

20:20.479 --> 20:21.979
Why are you covered in chocolate?

20:21.980 --> 20:23.447
Why are you covered in wine?

20:23.448 --> 20:24.782
Don't ask questions.

20:24.783 --> 20:26.383
Yeah, ditto.
Oh.

20:26.384 --> 20:28.319
I feel like I French-kissed
the whole train.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.054
Uh... yum.

20:30.055 --> 20:32.590
Hey, Mom, did you have a nice
birthday at least? I did.

20:32.591 --> 20:34.592
Wait, who told you it was my birthday?

20:34.593 --> 20:37.228
Oh, look, there's Ethan.

20:37.262 --> 20:39.238
- He's yelling something.
- Oh, hey, Ethan,

20:39.264 --> 20:40.798
we found your chocolate.

20:40.799 --> 20:43.409
It's on our faces and in our tummies.

20:43.435 --> 20:44.935
No! Them! They did it.

20:44.936 --> 20:46.170
They took the chocolate!

20:46.171 --> 20:49.063
It was them, they took the chocolate!
