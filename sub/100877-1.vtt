No.

30:57.833 --> 31:02.042

He is you, but more?

31:06.541 --> 31:08.833
Me but more.

31:10.459 --> 31:11.658
Intriguing.

He killed them both

Your father longs for death.

this mark.

37:42.376 --> 37:46.542

this boy still exists.

I've rightfully protected
my husband from death two times,

37:51.042 --> 37:55.326

impatient with my interference.

do when he finds out I'm...

Nevermind that.

My child, if I can't
change your father's mind

38:05.958 --> 38:08.075
before the night
of the blood moon,

38:08.125 --> 38:09.658
you must run away with the boy.

38:48.250 --> 38:51.075

to control your father

38:51.125 --> 38:55.334
would be an
unforgivable betrayal.

40:09.459 --> 40:13.408
she was bathing
in the blood of her parents.

I can do that.

41:12.209 --> 41:13.500
Okay.

41:15.416 --> 41:17.539

41:17.541 --> 41:20.242
Who attacked us
and what do they want with us,

41:20.292 --> 41:22.409
and who are you
and Mr. Personality?

41:22.459 --> 41:26.075
FROST: I can only answer
about Titus.

41:26.125 --> 41:29.200
I must go back to the beginning.

41:29.250 --> 41:32.534
Cain is known
as the world's first murderer.

41:32.584 --> 41:37.783
He's the son of Adam and Eve,
older brother to Abel.

41:37.833 --> 41:41.408
When God favored
Abel's offering over Cain's,

41:41.458 --> 41:45.451
Cain grew increasingly angry
until one day

41:45.501 --> 41:49.326
he lured his brother to a field
and killed him.

41:49.376 --> 41:53.783
God, of course,
knew right away what he had done

41:53.833 --> 41:55.658
and marked him for eternity.

41:55.708 --> 42:00.117
Cain was then cast away
from all he had known

42:00.167 --> 42:03.451
and left to wander
the Earth aimlessly.

42:03.501 --> 42:07.242
And, because the Earth
would no longer yield to him,

42:07.292 --> 42:10.409
he was forced to live
off the blood of man.

42:10.459 --> 42:14.575
He became a vampire,
cursed and immortal.

42:14.625 --> 42:18.326
Later, Cain met
and married Lillith.

42:18.376 --> 42:19.326
Before turning Lillith,

42:19.376 --> 42:24.451
they had a son, Enoch,
who also bore the Mark of Cain.

42:24.501 --> 42:27.575
No one understood
the mark's power at the time.

42:27.625 --> 42:31.616
It was just a mark,
or at the most, a reminder.

42:31.666 --> 42:35.366
When Enoch grew,
he married and had children,

42:35.416 --> 42:38.284
and as Cain and Lillith's
lineage continued on,

42:38.334 --> 42:41.451
each firstborn son
carried the Mark of Cain.

42:41.501 --> 42:43.992
It wasn't until
many centuries later

42:44.042 --> 42:46.326
that Cain discovered
the mark represented

42:46.376 --> 42:49.825
a potential escape
from the unending curse.

42:49.875 --> 42:52.742
You see,
on the first lunar tetrad,

42:52.792 --> 42:54.616
he was wounded and almost killed

42:54.666 --> 42:57.366
by another vampire
who bore the mark.

42:57.416 --> 43:01.200
It was then that Cain realized
he could die.

43:01.250 --> 43:05.284
Lillith did everything she could
to prevent Cain's death

43:05.334 --> 43:06.867
by tracking down and eradicating

43:06.917 --> 43:11.326
all who were unlucky enough
to bear the mark.

43:11.376 --> 43:13.200
She thought herself successful

43:13.250 --> 43:16.408
until one day Cain found Titus.

43:16.458 --> 43:18.451
Now, Cain has taken Titus

43:18.501 --> 43:23.584
and will force him to end
Cain's suffering through death.

all those years ago,

I inherited a curse
seven times worse than death,

close in on itself.

on the little things.

58:16.458 --> 58:19.326
I have lived
for thousands of years,

ruled this very world,
and was its end.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.958
Only I remained.

58:27.209 --> 58:29.533

58:29.583 --> 58:34.125
After the anger dissipated,
a giant void took over.

58:35.167 --> 58:37.541
It wasn't loneliness I felt,

58:38.125 --> 58:41.584
but rather
deep and utter emptiness.

58:42.125 --> 58:45.125
When Frost came to me with hope,

58:45.584 --> 58:46.744
I realized I had been lacking

58:46.792 --> 58:49.075
the most important thing of all,

58:49.125 --> 58:51.034
something even Cain
had managed to have

58:51.084 --> 58:53.292
throughout his journey.

58:54.209 --> 58:55.658
I lacked love.

58:55.708 --> 58:59.376
Sonny, Lucian, my mother,

59:00.125 --> 59:03.958
and you, Jocelyn.

59:04.917 --> 59:06.708
And me what?

59:08.500 --> 59:10.917
I should not say.

59:11.500 --> 59:11.956

59:11.958 --> 59:12.906
- You kidding me?
- I do not joke.

59:12.908 --> 59:12.918
I do not joke.

59:12.958 --> 59:17.700
You said you'd anser my
questions so answer them

59:17.750 --> 59:21.408
Jocelyn, as a boy, it was
no secret to anyone around us.

59:21.458 --> 59:24.450
I was deeply infatuated
with you.

59:24.500 --> 59:25.658
But what they didn't know

59:25.708 --> 59:27.825
is that it ran
much deeper than that.

59:27.875 --> 59:30.451
Through the years, I tried
to replace those feelings

59:30.501 --> 59:33.584
with others, with anything.

59:35.542 --> 59:41.958
Yet, after a thousand lifetimes,
you've never left my heart.

59:42.833 --> 59:48.666
Even in the end,
all we are is what we remember.

to hear.

how he feels about me.

And last night
before Cain took him,

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.458

What if you both disappear?

01:00:53.334 --> 01:00:54.616
What if...

01:00:54.666 --> 01:00:56.408
What if you and Titus

01:00:56.458 --> 01:01:00.376
are exactly as you should be?

01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:02.492
I'm an abomination.

01:01:02.542 --> 01:01:04.367
I shouldn't exist.

01:01:04.417 --> 01:01:07.992
If that's true, then Sonny
and I are abominations, too,

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:12.117
because we wouldn't be here
if you hadn't come back.

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:13.408
So should we not exist?

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:15.575
Jocelyn should always exist.

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:16.200
Okay. Then...

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.742
Maybe we should let Titus
fulfil his purpose

01:01:19.792 --> 01:01:21.450
I know that we're still going to

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.533
have to be there
to grab Luke, but-

01:01:24.583 --> 01:01:26.833
- You'd join me?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.908
Of course.

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:32.325
I mean, you're Titus, too.

01:01:32.375 --> 01:01:34.501
No, I'm not.

01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:37.534
You're but a child.

01:01:37.584 --> 01:01:39.875
It's not as simple as that.

01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:44.958
Life isn't this fairytale.

01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:50.117
You, Lucian, and even Sonny
will all die one day.

01:01:50.167 --> 01:01:51.491
I can't protect you forever.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.783
So we'll find another way.

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.783
There's always a way.

01:01:55.833 --> 01:01:56.742
No.

01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:59.075
No one can survive.

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:02.376
So you're
not even willing to try?

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:03.825
It's pointless.

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:05.450
- You're wrong!
- There is no hope.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.075
No, you're wrong!

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.783
You say that
it's pointless, but we need you.

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:11.750
We all need you.

01:02:12.042 --> 01:02:14.908
You're the only one
who knows what the future holds,

01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:16.284
and you're the only one
who can stop

01:02:16.334 --> 01:02:18.326
whatever it is
that's going to happen,

01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:21.500
and you're the only one
who can help alter it.

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:24.917
Jocelyn, I forgot
how smart you are.

01:02:28.459 --> 01:02:30.366
Did I change your mind?

01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:32.584
No one can.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.542
Then this isn't over.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:42.458
I'm not going to let you die.

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:47.167
I won't let either of you die.

01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:58.000
Hello?

01:02:58.292 --> 01:02:59.584
Hello?

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.376
Let me out!

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:08.242
Gentry?

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.417
Yes, it's me.

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:14.366
I don't know what's going on.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.034
Why am I locked up in here?

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:20.159
We were attacked
by vampires, Gentry, vampires.

01:03:20.209 --> 01:03:23.583
Yeah, and they saved us.

01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:29.209
I know, but where are they?

01:03:29.584 --> 01:03:31.867
You were
just out there with them.

01:03:31.917 --> 01:03:33.159
Yeah. I don't know.

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:37.242
They've given me a small amount
of freedom while you heal.

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:39.417
Whatever. I'm leaving.

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:40.625
Ah.

01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:42.708
Get out of my way.

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:44.616
Just wait.

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:46.034
They're coming.

01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:50.500
Besides, they wanted me to
come in here and wait with you.

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:52.501
TITUS: Fine.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.451
I don't know how much longer
I can just sit here.

01:03:59.501 --> 01:04:04.250
They took Luke and killed
everyone.

01:04:04.459 --> 01:04:05.867
I can't even think straight.

01:04:05.917 --> 01:04:07.450
They said
they tried to save them,

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.075
but they were too late.

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:11.742
I'm so sorry-

01:04:11.792 --> 01:04:14.125
- I'm going to kill him!

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.867
Don't worry.

01:04:15.917 --> 01:04:18.075
You'll get your chance.

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.325
Who are you?

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:21.825
I am called Cain.

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:25.541
And when I speak,
you will listen.

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:31.416
One of my children has taken
a particular interest in you.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.450
It may seem strange

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.992
but you alone possess
something very special.

01:04:37.042 --> 01:04:40.326
The mark upon your back
is God-given

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:42.534
and holds a sacred power.

01:04:42.584 --> 01:04:45.700
Because of this,
it's the target he's after,

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:51.042
and unfortunately,
only you can stop him.

01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.409
How do I kill him?

01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:54.366
In two days' time,

01:04:54.416 --> 01:05:00.581
a great event takes place
on the blood moon, the tetrad.

01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:03.867
It's happened
only four times in history.

01:05:03.917 --> 01:05:08.284
If I were to turn you
into a vampire on that day,

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:09.492
you would become a god

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:12.500
powerful enough to do just that.

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:16.500
Two days' time, boy.

01:05:17.376 --> 01:05:19.292
Think on it.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:24.292
GENTRY: I know
it's a lot to take in.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:27.375
I just don't understand.

01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:30.209
Why did they kill them?

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.584
GENTRY: I know.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.541
But we'll make them pay for it.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:38.408
What are you talking about?

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:39.533
I don't even know you.

01:05:39.583 --> 01:05:42.200
You're just some weak little
girl.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.376
Shut your mouth!

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:50.376
I've been through more than
you'll ever know.

01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:52.742
I watched as the life

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:56.917
drained out of
my parents' eyes that night,

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.417
and it was...

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.458
terrible.

01:06:05.833 --> 01:06:08.575
I know we lost your friends,

01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:09.284
so forgive me

01:06:09.334 --> 01:06:12.700
if maybe I don't want that
to happen to your brother too.

Gentry.

01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:18.584
You know nothing about me.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.125
Wait.

It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:42.408
Where's my mom?

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.950
I want to be with her.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.908
Ah.

01:06:44.958 --> 01:06:46.458
Of course.

01:06:47.459 --> 01:06:51.825
Well, unfortunately for you,

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:56.376
your mother has been marooned,

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.458
indefinitely.

01:07:09.584 --> 01:07:11.200
I've brought you some food.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:13.209
I'm not hungry.

01:07:13.292 --> 01:07:14.459
No?

01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:17.375
I just want to go home.

01:07:21.892 --> 01:07:22.790
What are those?

01:07:22.792 --> 01:07:26.958
Nothing you need to concern
yourself about.

01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:31.326
May I suggest eating a little

01:07:31.376 --> 01:07:34.541
so you can keep up
your strength?

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:39.917
I suspect you're going to need
it.

01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:43.000
Okay.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.373
Sink me, boy!

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:53.042
Always clumsy, Steven!

Steven? I'm Luke.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.459
I'm sorry.

Aye.

that.

01:08:16.084 --> 01:08:17.750
It's not cooked.

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:25.292
I don't suppose you can.

01:08:26.542 --> 01:08:29.783
I'll have Maggie cook up

01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:35.457
something a little bit
more palatable, Luke.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.200

to fix that.

memories of the one he loves.

I thought you were dead.

why do you get to go in and out

I would never leave you.

01:54:25.583 --> 01:54:30.084
or seen the light shining
in her eyes.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.409
I missed her by a minute.

01:54:33.459 --> 01:54:35.792
JOCE: Can you go back
and try again?

01:54:36.125 --> 01:54:37.459
No.

01:54:38.416 --> 01:54:40.533
That was my only chance.

01:54:40.583 --> 01:54:44.167
JOCELYN: You saved
both her sons.

01:54:44.583 --> 01:54:46.334
I know.

01:54:46.417 --> 01:54:47.616
How's Titus?

01:54:47.666 --> 01:54:50.825
He's safe,
which is what matters.

01:54:50.875 --> 01:54:52.825
You have something
on your mind.

01:54:52.875 --> 01:54:55.792
JOCELYN: I have memories
on my mind.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.792
Why are your memories
different than Titus's?

01:55:02.458 --> 01:55:04.616
It's the flow of time.

01:55:04.666 --> 01:55:09.200
My mind has had thousands of
years to unweave itself.

01:55:09.250 --> 01:55:11.075
JOCELYN: I remember you
telling us once

01:55:11.125 --> 01:55:14.583
that all we are
is what we remember.

01:55:15.209 --> 01:55:17.292
You remember me.

01:55:17.458 --> 01:55:18.917
He doesn't.

01:55:19.125 --> 01:55:20.501
He will.

01:55:22.792 --> 01:55:25.250
And I will not forget.

01:55:39.209 --> 01:55:43.250
I have no map or memory
for this either.

01:55:45.541 --> 01:55:50.000
But you, Jocelyn,
are my North Star.

01:55:57.209 --> 01:55:58.783
You know,

01:55:58.833 --> 01:56:03.334
sometimes,
I really miss you, Mother.

01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:08.125
Sometimes.

01:56:20.666 --> 01:56:22.541
Hello, my love.

01:56:25.334 --> 01:56:25.908
Joce?

01:56:25.958 --> 01:56:27.908
GENTRY: Of course, silly.

01:56:27.958 --> 01:56:29.992
I can't take this anymore.

01:56:30.042 --> 01:56:31.950
I'm about to break.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.125
I'm coming for you.

01:56:35.541 --> 01:56:37.459
Hurry.

01:56:42.917 --> 01:56:47.541
