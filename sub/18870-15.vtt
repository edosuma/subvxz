WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.405
Snooping. How far is too far?

00:05.472 --> 00:07.774
Lord. What did you do?

00:07.841 --> 00:10.844
<i>I may have taken a box of keepsakes
from Justin's apartment.</i>

00:10.910 --> 00:14.047
I really wish I could make
an observation about a person of color

00:14.114 --> 00:16.149
- and it not be labeled as a racist.
- Bullshit!

00:16.416 --> 00:19.986
Garrett wants me to get a photographer
from "Entertainment Weekly" to be there

00:20.053 --> 00:21.588
to promote the "GDU" family.

00:21.988 --> 00:23.890
So, a party full of people I don't like.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.291
I found this under your couch.

00:25.358 --> 00:27.494
Justin's worth 30 million dollars?

00:27.761 --> 00:28.862
It's my dad.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.663
Kara, it's okay.

00:31.297 --> 00:32.699
It's the end for him.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.245
Thank you.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.448
You liked the show?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.483
Watching you on TV is one thing.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.818
I'm ready to see you.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.521
- In the flesh.
- I'm ready too.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.556
<i>More than ready.</i>

00:56.990 --> 00:58.491
You sound a little distracted.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.293
You know, I was thinking...

01:01.361 --> 01:03.062
We haven't done this before,

01:03.129 --> 01:06.266
but what about us
taking a weekend getaway?

01:06.332 --> 01:07.567
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

01:07.634 --> 01:10.537
That sounds enticing,
specially after being here in Vancouver.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.905
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

01:13.139 --> 01:16.776
Necker Island? Richard Branson owns it.
The Obamas love it.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.879
We could fly in
and go first-class the whole way.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.217
A villa there
runs about 30,000 dollars a week,

01:24.284 --> 01:26.486
and I'm all for romance, but...

01:27.153 --> 01:28.888
<i>I think that's a little bit steep.</i>

01:29.322 --> 01:32.492
- Okay, buzz-kill. The Hamptons?
- Much better.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.360
You're lucky I'm easy to please.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.831
Mary Jane Paul,
you're the most uneasy to please woman

01:38.097 --> 01:39.466
that I've ever met.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.167
Maybe you are getting to know me.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.903
I know.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.038
I'll see you soon.

01:45.505 --> 01:46.673
Not soon enough.

01:51.711 --> 01:52.846
<i>Well...</i>

01:52.912 --> 01:54.280
<i>From the top.</i>

01:56.516 --> 01:57.650
<i>Low!</i>

01:59.085 --> 02:02.489
<i>Every time you repeat this
get a little bit bigger.</i>

02:05.124 --> 02:06.626
<i>The bigger the roll of the hips,</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:08.828
<i>the bigger the waist hugging.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:10.530
<i>Roll. Now...</i>

02:10.997 --> 02:14.634
Grandma, did you teleport that leotard
and matching headband from the eighties?

02:15.068 --> 02:18.037
You need to be joining me
instead of mocking me.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.840
What's got you exercising all fierce
all of a sudden?

02:21.341 --> 02:23.877
I saw Bonetta in church the other day,

02:24.811 --> 02:28.948
looking all young and wearing high heels.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.216
That woman is older than me.

02:30.783 --> 02:32.185
Got me inspired.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.388
Don't hurt yourself.

02:35.455 --> 02:40.660
Baby girl, I was doing aerobics
long before you learned to be sassy.

02:44.898 --> 02:45.999
Are you hanging in there?

02:47.100 --> 02:49.202
I'm okay.
I mean, I haven't been sleeping much

02:49.269 --> 02:50.637
since my dad passed away.

02:51.137 --> 02:53.673
And Orlando
is on his twenty-game road trip.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.741
So no...

02:55.808 --> 02:57.043
Not even.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.313
Well, I know you're sad, but...

03:01.281 --> 03:02.415
Hi.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.884
Any interest in a little piping hot tea?

03:07.153 --> 03:08.655
Anything to occupy my mind.

03:08.721 --> 03:09.756
- Right this way.
- Yes?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.426
So, what would you do if someone you knew

03:14.527 --> 03:16.129
was worth a crap ton of money?

03:16.930 --> 03:18.197
Be happy for them?

03:19.399 --> 03:22.201
What if they were keeping it a secret?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.738
Is this a story idea, Mary Jane?

03:26.139 --> 03:28.541
What if it was Justin?

03:29.342 --> 03:30.510
No, no.

03:31.311 --> 03:34.647
Justin is worth thirty million dollars.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.015
- What?

03:36.816 --> 03:38.084
- Yes!
- What...?

03:38.151 --> 03:39.352
Get...

03:41.487 --> 03:42.555
Mary Jane?

03:42.622 --> 03:44.424
Just give me two seconds.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.658
Just two seconds.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.496
So...

03:51.130 --> 03:52.832
How did you learn this?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.602
I accidentally read
his financial statements.

03:55.868 --> 03:56.836
Accidentally?

03:57.203 --> 03:58.204
Yeah...

03:58.605 --> 03:59.839
It sort of fell out of a box

03:59.906 --> 04:02.375
in his apartment,
in the back of his closet.

04:02.442 --> 04:03.943
Mary Jane, what did you do?

04:04.010 --> 04:06.980
I returned it. Eventually.

04:07.046 --> 04:08.514
Are you sure about this info?

04:08.581 --> 04:09.749
Hold, please.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.388
Hello! She took a picture.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.225
You know?
I've been missing the old Mary Jane,

04:19.292 --> 04:20.893
and she is back with a vengeance.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.829
- I know. God.
- Yes!

04:22.895 --> 04:25.365
But how does a news producer
have that kind of money?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.500
I don't know! It can't be family money

04:27.567 --> 04:29.268
his dad was a car salesman.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.805
- Why don't you ask him?
- Because then he'll know I was snooping.

04:36.075 --> 04:39.312
- I'm sure he'll mention it eventually.
- What if he doesn't?

04:39.379 --> 04:42.415
You'll get it out of him.
This is too big a deal not to mention.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.217
Come on, it's a lot of money.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.753
- It's weird, isn't it?
- What?

04:46.819 --> 04:48.888
We could both end up
with multimillionaires.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.089
My God!

04:50.156 --> 04:52.125
I don't call that weird.
I call that winning!

04:57.997 --> 04:59.799
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.603
Go find Marquis.

05:04.704 --> 05:05.905
Go ahead, go to his room.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.744
- Don't open the fridge.
- Why not?

05:12.378 --> 05:13.479
They shut off the power.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.448
Amika, are you serious?

05:16.683 --> 05:18.918
I ran out of cash.
I had to choose between bills.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.154
I got a cooler.
Put those lunches in there.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.925
I can't leave my kids
in a home with no lights.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.493
How could you let this happen?

05:28.928 --> 05:30.797
I was looking for work at Home Solutions,

05:30.863 --> 05:33.199
because the doctor said
I need to be with Marquis more.

05:36.569 --> 05:37.637
He's still not talking?

05:38.171 --> 05:39.739
He will when he has something to say.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.510
How much is it to turn the lights on?

05:45.978 --> 05:47.413
Look at that wad of cash!

05:48.114 --> 05:49.282
It's tips.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.585
It only looks like a lot
because it comes in ones.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.621
Thank you.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.558
I'm not doing this
out of the goodness of my heart.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.129
I'm doing this
because I need this child thing to work.

06:04.464 --> 06:06.299
Still, thank you.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.134
I have to go.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.002
I don't have time for this.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.105
Treyvion?

06:16.576 --> 06:18.144
Come on, let's go.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.317
These are not my usual eggs and bacon.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.319
It's quinoa and egg whites.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.855
High in protein and low in calories.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.456
Quin-what?

06:30.523 --> 06:32.558
It smells like burnt tire.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.330
Dad, can you please
watch the kids for me?

06:38.164 --> 06:40.066
Amika flaked,
and I've got to get to work.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.201
I have a lot of work calls
this afternoon.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.837
Please? You know how my boss is
about being late.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.207
- Maybe I can reschedule a few things.
- Thank you!

06:48.674 --> 06:50.777
- Here, go to Grandpa.
- Alright.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.079
- Yes, you are.
- The biggest reason I'm saying yes

06:53.146 --> 06:55.581
is because it's great to see you
so caught up in the job.

06:55.648 --> 06:56.816
It's a blessing.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.418
Get some strawberries before you go.

07:02.488 --> 07:05.224
Grandma,
what's on this strawberries? Dirt?

07:05.691 --> 07:07.326
No, it's chia seeds.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.595
More fiber, more protein.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.064
This healthy kick has gone way too far.

07:12.131 --> 07:14.033
Why don't we take them to get waffles?

07:14.100 --> 07:16.335
- Now you're talking.
- Give them some real food.

07:16.402 --> 07:17.470
Its healthy!

07:18.771 --> 07:20.706
- Hello?
- You wanted to talk.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.811
Yes, so, the stuff we've been doing
to improve your Q rating is helping.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.612
The feedback is all positive.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.414
Why am I sensing a "but"?

07:28.915 --> 07:31.951
But there has been
one unintentional consequence.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.420
<i>Mary Jane Paul hosted her colleagues</i>

07:34.487 --> 07:37.056
<i>to celebrate
the big happy "Great Day USA" family.</i>

07:37.590 --> 07:40.059
<i>But the belle of the ball
was the conservative blogger</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:42.228
<i>turned correspondent, Dani Hollins,</i>

07:42.595 --> 07:45.798
<i>whose bubbly sense of fun
has captivated viewers.</i>

07:46.098 --> 07:47.633
<i>And, according to insiders,</i>

07:47.700 --> 07:50.269
<i>it's Hollins
who will be the network's big star.</i>

07:50.736 --> 07:52.705
That's the unintended consequence.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.707
All of the coverage is about Dani.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.076
Nothing to worry about.
It'll will blow over.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.445
Mary Jane, come here. Look at this.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.550
The school board just slashed the budget
for this high school

08:04.617 --> 08:07.253
for the third time this year.
They're diverting funds

08:07.320 --> 08:09.455
to a for a profit private charter school

08:09.522 --> 08:12.592
and the students and parents
are planning a big protest tomorrow.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.528
Let me guess: the school
they're slashing is poor and black.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.830
The people that orchestrated it
are making bank.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.233
It's disgusting.
They're taking advantage of kids

08:20.299 --> 08:22.335
who have it hard enough already,
you know?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.104
This totally ties in
with all the controversy

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
swirling around
the new Education Secretary

08:27.406 --> 08:29.575
who is a big supporter of school choice.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.410
- Yes.
- We should send a team.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.747
I'm one step ahead of you.
I already convinced Garrett to send you.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.751
So, I'll get to be doing
the hard-hitting stories that I want!

08:38.818 --> 08:40.620
Exactly, and you're going to love this.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.321
Justin is cutting Vancouver short,

08:42.388 --> 08:44.423
so he can be back in time
to handle the story.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.858
Hallelujah! Praise Jesus!

08:46.325 --> 08:47.460
My God.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.829
Wait, if I'm out in the field,

08:50.997 --> 08:52.732
who'll take the place in my chair?

09:15.421 --> 09:17.323
Dani has been here all of five minutes,

09:17.390 --> 09:19.592
and she's already filling in
at the anchor desk?

09:19.659 --> 09:21.360
Wait a minute. Slow it down.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.496
Aren't you being a little hypocritical?

09:24.530 --> 09:25.631
Remember?

09:25.698 --> 09:28.034
I was promised that chair
when I signed my contract.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.269
Mary Jane, this is a good thing.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.138
I pushed hard for you to get this story.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.540
Keep going.
You'll help them push me out the door.

09:34.607 --> 09:35.942
I'm surprised at you.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.944
We have to think about your brand.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.247
We have to move you past fashion tips
and movie premieres.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.715
That is morning television.

09:42.782 --> 09:44.850
Yes it is, but that is not who you are.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.753
If you want to rise to the top,
you have to stay true to yourself.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.189
The country needs you, especially now.

09:50.556 --> 09:53.526
If somebody has to save the world,

09:54.393 --> 09:55.828
might as well be me.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.063
That's my girl.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.007
- Frank Pearl?
- Hey, Paul.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.208
I'll be damned.

10:09.709 --> 10:13.279
- The last time I saw you...
- Was 44 years ago.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.047
Don't remind me, man.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.416
It was 44 long years ago.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.553
So tell me, what brings you
to my door after so much time?

10:20.619 --> 10:22.421
I'm not here to create any problems.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.191
I figured maybe we could sit down

10:25.257 --> 10:26.559
and have a conversation.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.995
Okay.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.568
It's a damn shame.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.870
I spent most of my life in this city,

10:37.937 --> 10:39.238
and I barely recognize it.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.940
It's changed, hasn't it?

10:41.707 --> 10:43.676
It sure has. Haven't we all?

10:43.943 --> 10:48.214
As long as I'm here in the city,
I might as well check it out.

10:48.781 --> 10:52.084
Go see if some of our old spots
are still there.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.420
Stir up the pot a little bit, you know?

10:54.954 --> 10:56.522
Is that what brings you to town?

10:56.856 --> 10:58.624
No, I'm here because of my sister.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.192
She's not feeling well,

11:00.259 --> 11:02.928
so I'm here to help her get settled
in assisted living.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.431
Is she reluctant to make a change?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.933
She's been living on her own since 1973,

11:08.701 --> 11:11.337
piling up a lot of junk over the years.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.373
Sounds like a big job on your hands.

11:15.741 --> 11:19.245
I came here to talk to you
about making amends,

11:19.845 --> 11:21.147
hashing up our friendship.

11:23.682 --> 11:24.784
You mean that?

11:25.418 --> 11:30.056
Remember back in the day
when I was raising all that hell?

11:30.623 --> 11:31.791
We were tight.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.160
I feel I owe you.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.697
That was a long, long time ago.

11:38.764 --> 11:39.899
It's all in the past.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.300
Helen, come on in here.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.302
Guess who showed up at our doorstep.

11:43.903 --> 11:47.306
Glory me! Is this Frank Pearl?

11:48.574 --> 11:49.875
Hello, Helen. Nice to see you.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.477
Nice to see you, too.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.380
Frank's in town for a spell
to help his sister.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.651
I just dropped by to catch up
with an old friend.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.587
See you guys. I have some runs to make.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.689
You do not such thing.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.024
Don't let me interrupt you.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.627
I'm sure you two have much to talk about.

12:17.837 --> 12:18.971
Don't bother.

12:19.038 --> 12:22.141
All that's in there
is Grandma's homemade yogurt.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.477
Yes, she threw all the good stuff out.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.078
But I have a secret stash.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.015
Alright!

12:32.585 --> 12:35.988
So, who's that super fly guy
Grandpa is in there right now?

12:36.255 --> 12:39.191
Old friend of Dad's.
I think they grew up together.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.094
All I know is they had a falling out
and haven't talked in years.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.729
I'm glad they found each other again.

12:52.404 --> 12:53.973
Frank is looking well.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.175
Is he?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.313
He's always had a bit of a swagger.

13:05.551 --> 13:09.755
If you're trying to get me
to say something, it won't work.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.760
Okay.
I'll just come right out and ask you.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.663
Did you know your ex-lover was in town?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.933
Is that what's behind
this health kick you're on?

13:22.168 --> 13:23.269
Paul.

13:23.702 --> 13:24.970
Frank and I...

13:25.304 --> 13:28.541
It's water under a 40 year-old bridge.

13:31.610 --> 13:35.014
He's invited me to have lunch with him
while he's here.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.550
You're gonna take him up on that?

13:39.985 --> 13:42.588
I prefer to let sleeping dogs lie.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.459
<i>Stand up! Fight back!</i>

13:47.526 --> 13:51.597
The school board
have been starving us of resources,

13:51.664 --> 13:52.865
but no more!

13:52.932 --> 13:55.801
We'll stand up and fight back!

13:56.202 --> 13:57.803
Stand up! Fight back!

13:57.870 --> 13:59.505
Jacy, you're graduating this year.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.840
Tell us why you care
about the budget cuts.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.509
I'd like to be graduating,

14:03.576 --> 14:06.412
but the board stopped funding
the upper-level classes I need.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.080
They cut and they keep cutting.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.516
This is happening in districts
across the nation,

14:10.583 --> 14:13.485
- where they cut arts and foreign...
- You don't understand!

14:13.552 --> 14:14.853
Look at my class schedule.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.522
I have three hours for lunch.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.892
Five out of seven periods
are lunch or study hall.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.362
<i>You're showing up to school,
but not a lot of learning is going on.</i>

14:23.429 --> 14:26.031
<i>It'll take my friends and I
five years to graduate,</i>

14:26.098 --> 14:28.867
<i>- just because the classes aren't there.
- Five years?</i>

14:29.201 --> 14:32.538
<i>All I want to do is finish school,
go to college,</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:34.039
and make something for myself.

14:34.106 --> 14:36.709
I don't get why the school board
doesn't want that, too.

14:37.109 --> 14:40.145
We'll get the answers, Jacy.
Thank you for sharing your story.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.749
Stand up! Fight back!
Stand up! Fight back!

14:43.816 --> 14:46.118
We'll be following up
with updates on Jacy

14:46.185 --> 14:48.687
and her fellow protesters
during the rest of the hour.

14:48.754 --> 14:49.688
Back to you.

14:53.192 --> 14:56.662
Stand up! Fight back!
Stand up! Fight back!

14:57.062 --> 14:58.631
So how much of that did you catch?

14:59.298 --> 15:00.332
Enough.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.034
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.769
We can reference that student later

15:03.836 --> 15:05.838
when Dani interviews
a school board member.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.106
That's a great idea.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.642
I'm really glad you're back.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.112
Me too.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.348
Are you ready to interview those parents?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.384
- I am.
- Good.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.421
Kara was right. I did miss all of this.

15:23.188 --> 15:24.590
Almost as much as I missed you.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.126
Almost.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.104
Kara, the school board
has been taken over

15:39.171 --> 15:41.840
<i>by a local group
that's pushing a low-tax agenda.</i>

15:41.907 --> 15:43.742
Yes, and according to these bios,

15:43.809 --> 15:46.779
they have zero experience
in public education.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.681
<i>It's all about the bottom line for them.</i>

15:48.747 --> 15:51.717
They've been consistently diverting funds
away from the school,

15:51.784 --> 15:53.185
which is already struggling.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.754
Now conditions are so bad,
they could close it

15:55.821 --> 15:58.090
and replace it
with a for-profit charter school.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.693
- It's what they wanted all along.
- It's criminal.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.662
Do you know what happened
with that board member? Where's he?

16:03.729 --> 16:05.130
We have him here in the studio.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.965
And now I know what to hit him with.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.773
- Hey, Cashea. Are you alright?
- I'm so late, I'm sorry.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.843
Don't worry.
Claudia held your appointment.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.179
I'll get you started, sit down.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.081
Hi, baby! Hi!

16:22.147 --> 16:23.916
You want to sit down here, big boy?

16:27.786 --> 16:29.621
What happened? Why are you late?

16:29.688 --> 16:30.956
The bus never showed

16:31.023 --> 16:33.592
so I borrowed my sister's car
and all of a sudden,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.261
I get pulled over
for not having Samir in a car seat.

16:37.563 --> 16:38.997
And the cop gave you a ticket.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.900
A 300 dollar ticket.
It doesn't make sense.

16:42.401 --> 16:43.669
I don't have 300 dollars.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.038
If I did, I would have bought
the damn car seat.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.507
Exactly. And they're too expensive,

16:48.574 --> 16:50.275
and the kids outgrow them so fast.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.278
I barely paid off the other one
before I had to buy a new one.

16:53.879 --> 16:54.880
Sorry, girl.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.254
Mr. Russo, what do you say to the claims

17:02.321 --> 17:04.556
of an illegal takeover
of the school board?

17:04.890 --> 17:05.924
That's crazy.

17:06.225 --> 17:08.394
My group raised money
from local businesses

17:08.460 --> 17:11.764
and property owners fed up
with rising taxes and failing schools.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.400
We put forward
a slate of qualified candidates

17:14.466 --> 17:16.168
<i>committed to improving our schools.</i>

17:16.235 --> 17:19.071
<i>So, your group represents
the will of the people?</i>

17:19.405 --> 17:20.472
We won, didn't we?

17:21.240 --> 17:23.108
Ask if any of their qualified candidates

17:23.175 --> 17:24.643
<i>have kids in public schools.</i>

17:25.310 --> 17:27.579
Tell me what's happening
in Leland High School.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.649
The best students and teachers
have voted with their feet.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.317
It's what school choice is about.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.753
And what's left behind,
is a failing institution.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.455
Dani, enough with the soft balls.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.757
Ask him if his group took campaign money

17:38.824 --> 17:42.394
from for-profit,
charter management organizations.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.431
So, why not invest money
to turn the school around?

17:45.497 --> 17:48.100
<i>- Is she for real?
- Meanwhile, the kids stuck there</i>

17:48.167 --> 17:51.203
don't have time to wait for that.
We need a solution now.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.973
<i>Stick with the script, Dani.</i>

17:55.040 --> 17:57.810
And what about those who say
that school choice

17:57.876 --> 18:00.179
and charter schools are bad
for public education?

18:00.245 --> 18:01.914
I say a little competition

18:01.980 --> 18:04.016
might be the best thing
for public schools.

18:04.082 --> 18:06.151
<i>Injecting the discipline
of the marketplace</i>

18:06.218 --> 18:08.253
can be the remedy
for all kinds of problems.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.722
And that's why the school will be closed

18:10.789 --> 18:13.959
and that's also why the location
will become a De Novo charter school.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.127
Dammit, Dani.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.434
Frank called.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.971
He insists I go to the classic car show
with him tonight.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.374
- He's coming here?
- Wouldn't take no for an answer.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.544
It sounds to me
like he really wants his old friend back.

18:33.479 --> 18:36.548
The way you two used to tinker
with those old cars.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.986
- What's the harm in that?
- I suppose you are right.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.959
<i>And that's why the school will be closed,</i>

18:47.025 --> 18:49.928
<i>and that's also why the location
will become a charter school.</i>

18:49.995 --> 18:51.797
Stand up! Fight back!

18:52.464 --> 18:56.969
Listen up, everyone!
They are closing our school!

18:58.504 --> 19:01.340
Stand up and fight back!

19:01.740 --> 19:05.377
That reporter on your show
didn't call him out on his decision.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.412
He made it sound like a good thing!

19:07.479 --> 19:09.481
I thought this protest would fix things!

19:09.548 --> 19:12.284
Jacy, we'll make sure
your voices are being heard.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.419
When? When they board up the door?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.788
I thought you would tell our side.

19:25.497 --> 19:29.234
The anger of the crowds
has boiled over into outright hostility.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.639
The protesters feel the board
simply does not represent their views.

19:33.705 --> 19:35.207
This is our school! You leave!

19:37.910 --> 19:39.044
Get this!

19:40.946 --> 19:42.281
Get in there!

19:44.616 --> 19:46.518
- Officer.
- Sir, I need you to stand back.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.686
Why?

19:47.753 --> 19:49.454
We have more units coming in.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.057
<i>- What's happening?
- I'm fine.</i>

19:52.124 --> 19:53.258
Watch out! Make way!

19:53.325 --> 19:54.960
Okay, get ready to pull out.

19:59.097 --> 20:01.600
This is a non-violent protest!

20:01.667 --> 20:04.236
We have a right to do it!

20:08.540 --> 20:11.410
I just heard from Justin.
We have some real-time developments.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.111
Dani, go to Mary Jane.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.347
Get out of here!

20:16.915 --> 20:18.016
Mary Jane, are you okay?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.018
Mary Jane!

20:21.186 --> 20:22.321
Mary Jane!

20:25.591 --> 20:26.758
Justin!

20:29.528 --> 20:30.629
Justin!

20:31.229 --> 20:32.197
<i>Justin!</i>

20:34.766 --> 20:35.867
Justin!

20:37.769 --> 20:39.805
Cut to commercial, now! Go to commercial.

20:41.506 --> 20:43.108
Justin? Justin, can you hear me?

20:43.175 --> 20:44.209
Are you injured?

20:44.743 --> 20:45.777
Justin?

20:46.044 --> 20:47.145
Justin, can you hear me?

20:47.212 --> 20:50.449
- Sir, I need you to stay back.
- You don't get it, my girlfriend's there.

20:50.515 --> 20:52.751
<i>- Did you not hear me?
- Gosh.</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:54.920
<i>- Stay back!
- Mary Jane!</i>

20:59.992 --> 21:01.259
<i>I'll get her out of there.</i>

21:09.301 --> 21:10.402
God...

21:20.512 --> 21:23.482
<i>I want our let our viewers know
that our team is okay.</i>

21:23.548 --> 21:26.151
<i>We have moved a few dozen yards
from the conflict,</i>

21:26.218 --> 21:28.387
<i>where irate students and parents</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:31.156
<i>are attempting to prevent
the closure of a local high school.</i>

21:31.223 --> 21:32.991
<i>I repeat, we are fine.</i>

21:33.492 --> 21:35.027
Thank you.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.198
What...?

21:41.233 --> 21:42.668
Who's Justin?

21:47.205 --> 21:48.173
Hey.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.475
What are you doing here so early?

21:51.243 --> 21:52.511
Don't get fired again.

21:52.811 --> 21:53.845
Girl, I'm on my break.

21:56.515 --> 21:57.749
What's that about?

21:57.816 --> 21:58.950
It's my old car seat.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.753
- Thanks, but it's too small for Marquis.
- I know.

22:02.087 --> 22:04.156
Do you still have the other seat
he outgrew?

22:04.556 --> 22:05.891
It's somewhere around here.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.759
Alright, so you have two extra seats.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.596
- You'll start a work-from-home business.
- With car seats?

22:11.963 --> 22:13.565
Yes, I'll help you rent them out.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.201
You could potentially make
30 dollars a ride.

22:16.468 --> 22:19.871
Why would someone pay 30 dollars
to rent a car seat

22:19.938 --> 22:21.606
if they can afford one of their own?

22:21.673 --> 22:23.909
Because people would rather pay
30 dollars for one

22:24.409 --> 22:26.745
than pay 300 dollars for a ticket.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.613
Good point.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.848
But how do we let them know?

22:30.348 --> 22:31.416
Go get your phone.

22:32.117 --> 22:33.118
Go.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.730
That'll get their attention.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.934
Now you tweet everybody that you know
to advertise.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.004
This is fun.

22:53.939 --> 22:54.906
Thanks for helping me.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.109
Girl, we help each other.

22:58.343 --> 23:00.278
Hey! I got a taker.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.648
Keisha needs to take her kids
to their daddy's house across town.

23:03.915 --> 23:06.118
See? There you go. I told you.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.120
Now we are in business.

23:11.356 --> 23:12.491
What the hell was that?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.925
Must you be so hostile?

23:13.992 --> 23:16.328
You didn't even ask
about the students' schedule.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.764
Because it was obviously fake. Thank you.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.166
You can't ignore facts you don't like.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.934
That's why we give people scripts,

23:23.001 --> 23:25.303
so they're not caught
with personal opinions.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.039
My opinions are what got me here
in the first place, so...

23:28.106 --> 23:31.042
Which can be misconstrued as representing
the big... Excuse me.

23:31.943 --> 23:34.446
As representing the views
of "Great Day USA."

23:34.713 --> 23:37.182
So not only did you put forward
your own agenda,

23:37.249 --> 23:39.084
but you did it at the risk of two of us.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.720
It's my face
and my reputation that's on the line,

23:41.787 --> 23:42.921
and if I'm in that chair,

23:42.988 --> 23:45.323
it's my responsibility
to report what I believe in.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.692
Your responsibility
is to report what we give you.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.695
- That's your responsibility.
- My audience would think otherwise.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.364
Really? Let's see how long

23:52.430 --> 23:54.599
before you get in front
of that audience again.

24:06.745 --> 24:07.746
Who is Justin?

24:09.247 --> 24:10.582
Don't "huh" me.

24:10.916 --> 24:15.120
Pauletta has been all concerned
about somebody named Justin.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.155
- Who is he?
- Grandma, I don't know.

24:17.222 --> 24:20.525
I've got ten minutes to freshen up
and eat something before class.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.299
I have raised three kids
and I know when somebody's lying to me.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.667
I don't appreciate it,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.537
especially since I spent all that money
sending you to New York.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.140
He's a producer at "Great Day USA."

24:35.574 --> 24:37.175
Is he Pauletta's boyfriend?

24:37.242 --> 24:38.310
I think so.

24:39.377 --> 24:42.080
Is he the one she left Lee to be with?

24:44.649 --> 24:46.718
That girl is being reckless
with her heart.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.387
Giving up a sure thing

24:49.855 --> 24:53.024
and foolishly doing this thing
with somebody at work?

24:53.892 --> 24:55.727
Niecy, I wish you'd told me sooner,

24:55.794 --> 24:58.530
so that I could talk
some sense into her hard head.

25:00.298 --> 25:01.333
What is this?

25:01.733 --> 25:02.734
That's Justin.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.072
Yeah.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.120
Is that all it takes
to get some recognition around here?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.455
Almost get killed?

25:24.589 --> 25:26.758
- See you.
- Congratulations on the segment.

25:26.825 --> 25:27.893
"GDU" is now trending.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.862
Of course we're trending.
The police used force against kids.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.931
No, that's not the reason we're trending.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.232
- It's you.
- Me?

25:34.733 --> 25:35.934
Well, no. Him.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.104
"Who is Justin?"

25:39.170 --> 25:41.907
Seven million people
heard you scream his name live on TV.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.108
Like Whitney Houston

25:43.174 --> 25:45.210
yelling for Kevin Costner
in "The Bodyguard."

25:45.510 --> 25:49.080
The emotion in your voice.
That was powerful.

25:50.048 --> 25:54.119
It's gone viral, and now everybody
wants to know who that man is.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.627
I can't believe this
is what people are talking about.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.598
It's like they set the clock
to two minutes to midnight

26:06.665 --> 26:09.968
and now everybody wants to hop aboard
the latest gossip train.

26:10.035 --> 26:12.671
Embrace it.
Social media buzz, good or bad,

26:12.737 --> 26:14.039
is great for the show.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.742
- Dani is beating us at this game.
- How so?

26:18.076 --> 26:20.011
<i>I'm like an agent behind enemies lines,</i>

26:20.078 --> 26:22.981
<i>and the big city media elite
is trying to silence me.</i>

26:23.048 --> 26:25.650
<i>I know the school choice makes sense.
So do you.</i>

26:25.717 --> 26:29.821
<i>I'm sick and tired of liberal media
trying to censure what we already know.</i>

26:29.888 --> 26:32.891
Isn't she barred from doing this stuff
now that she's at "GDU"?

26:32.958 --> 26:34.893
She can't do her internet show,

26:34.960 --> 26:36.861
but there's always a new app or site

26:36.928 --> 26:39.130
that falls outside the purview
of her contract.

26:39.197 --> 26:41.933
That sneaky bitch.
How did she get the video up so fast?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.669
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us beating her.

26:44.736 --> 26:46.738
And the way to do it
is to answer the question.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.440
"Who is Justin?"

26:53.311 --> 26:55.280
I don't know if Justin is ready for that.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.016
It's happening, with or without him.

27:02.487 --> 27:03.688
Alright, if we do this,

27:03.755 --> 27:06.091
I'm gonna need to ask your help
for something.

27:06.624 --> 27:07.759
Okay.

27:07.826 --> 27:11.629
- It has to be completely secret.
- I work in PR.

27:11.696 --> 27:14.632
Pretty sure keeping secrets
it's part of the job description.

27:15.066 --> 27:16.368
And we're friends, right?

27:16.901 --> 27:19.137
I need you
to look into Justin's net worth.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.706
Does he owe back taxes or something?

27:21.773 --> 27:23.375
No, no.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.510
Funny, really...

27:27.178 --> 27:31.016
I have reason to believe
that Justin may be,

27:31.082 --> 27:32.917
like, a multi, multi, multimillionaire.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.254
Reason to believe? He hasn't told you?

27:36.588 --> 27:40.425
No, it has never come up in conversation.

27:41.226 --> 27:42.927
Which makes you suspicious.

27:43.361 --> 27:45.230
A little bit, yes.

27:45.797 --> 27:47.799
And before we

27:47.866 --> 27:49.801
bare our souls on Instagram,

27:49.868 --> 27:52.270
we want to make sure
everything's on the up and up.

27:52.937 --> 27:57.142
Because there's got to be
a logical explanation for it all.

27:57.776 --> 27:58.743
Right?

28:00.311 --> 28:01.579
I'll look into it.

28:01.646 --> 28:02.647
Great.

28:13.691 --> 28:14.859
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.895
- How was class?
- It was good.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.297
The kids sound like they're having fun.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.734
They wore me out,
I told them it was screen time.

28:22.801 --> 28:23.868
Yes, I'm sure.

28:24.702 --> 28:26.504
Girl, check this out.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.041
You booked seats for next week?

28:32.577 --> 28:34.813
Girl, I have to thank you.
I've never had a friend

28:34.879 --> 28:36.815
willing to help me in a real way
like that.

28:37.282 --> 28:41.286
You should be thanking that single mom
that gave me the idea.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.888
She was squirting out tears, all upset.

28:44.489 --> 28:45.657
You must hear a lot at work.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.427
Yes, I feel like I listen to problems
more than I actually fix hair.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.529
Good thing you're good at both.

28:51.796 --> 28:53.164
But you know what else?

28:53.231 --> 28:55.366
I feel like there's a solution
to every problem,

28:56.067 --> 28:58.937
and I have more ideas
for my baby mama life hacks.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.439
You should share them
with other moms like us.

29:02.173 --> 29:03.341
I should, right?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.544
Like you said, nobody will help us
if we can't help ourselves.

29:06.811 --> 29:08.546
I actually have another idea for you.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.852
It's time to expand, girl.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.623
I love the way you think.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.759
Where are you? I don't see you.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.161
Kara, are you alright?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.697
Yes, I was just expecting a package

29:25.763 --> 29:28.800
and tracking said it was delivered.
No big deal. What do have for me?

29:28.867 --> 29:31.102
You know that student
I interviewed, Jacy Davis?

29:31.169 --> 29:33.938
Could you try to reach her
and convince her to come on the show?

29:34.005 --> 29:35.707
Is she not returning your calls?

29:36.074 --> 29:37.542
Maybe you'll have better luck.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.010
- I'll try.
- Thanks.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.912
Sure. Okay.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.392
What's all this?

29:54.993 --> 29:57.128
I thought you and Frank
might like some dinner

29:57.195 --> 29:58.863
before you go to the car show.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.566
He's not coming, Helen.

30:03.601 --> 30:04.736
Did Frank cancel?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.337
Actually, I did.

30:07.772 --> 30:09.007
I thought it best that way.

30:12.610 --> 30:13.645
I understand.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.118
Glad you agree.

30:33.231 --> 30:36.501
You better hurry up
before the jet lag takes over.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.407
Maybe this will wake you up.

30:58.790 --> 31:01.526
Okay, get your face
out of the phone, please.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.261
I'm just fixing the music.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.862
No, you're not.

31:05.463 --> 31:06.464
Come here.

31:12.470 --> 31:13.638
And just so you know,

31:14.639 --> 31:20.245
hashtag WhoisJustin
got 4000 more likes today.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.781
You're so fascinated
by this hashtag WhoisJustin.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.818
Don't forget you got the real thing.

31:28.519 --> 31:30.421
See, I don't like having a hashtag.

31:34.158 --> 31:37.028
Honestly,
it's already interfering with our lives.

31:38.529 --> 31:40.698
I haven't been home for weeks,

31:40.765 --> 31:42.367
and this is what we're talking about?

31:44.369 --> 31:46.437
No. No, I've missed you.

31:47.972 --> 31:49.841
What? You what?

31:52.510 --> 31:54.145
I've missed you.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.681
Show me how much you missed me.

32:11.829 --> 32:15.566
Mary Jane, I got you another shot
on the school board story.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.201
I didn't get Jacy,

32:17.568 --> 32:20.204
but you'll be interviewing
a school board member, so...

32:20.705 --> 32:22.140
- Russo agreed to come back?
- Yes.

32:22.974 --> 32:24.175
What happened to Dani?

32:24.542 --> 32:25.843
She was sidelined.

32:27.945 --> 32:30.181
- So much for rising star.
- Yes.

32:30.248 --> 32:31.582
Thank you, seriously,

32:31.649 --> 32:34.185
for understanding
how important this issue is.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.688
I'm not on this by myself, you know?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.190
- Justin and I are co-producing it.
- Really?

32:39.257 --> 32:40.224
Yes.

32:40.491 --> 32:44.128
Maybe I'm starting to see Justin
in a better light.

32:44.962 --> 32:48.232
- The other day, I was live on the line.
- I know.

32:48.599 --> 32:51.402
And I have to say, if I was in trouble,

32:52.170 --> 32:54.238
I would want Justin
to be the guy looking for me.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.941
My God, you're starting to come around.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.009
I'm not there yet.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.379
But I do know that one thing
you've wanted your whole life,

33:01.646 --> 33:04.048
is a man
who claimed you as his own, so...

33:05.149 --> 33:08.519
If Justin really cares about you,
then he should be out there doing it.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.522
Go kick booty.

33:15.593 --> 33:16.894
We brought you back...

33:16.961 --> 33:19.731
You know I'll catch hell from Garrett
if this story is a dud.

33:20.264 --> 33:21.366
It won't be.

33:21.866 --> 33:24.469
And if it is, I'll back you up.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.371
<i>I might add,</i>

33:26.437 --> 33:29.006
money that's no longer available
to fix our schools.

33:29.073 --> 33:31.609
But hadn't you already decided
to close the school

33:31.676 --> 33:35.179
and hand it over to De Novo,
a for-profit charter school?

33:35.246 --> 33:36.881
After careful consideration,

33:36.948 --> 33:39.083
the school board decided unanimously

33:39.150 --> 33:40.785
it was the best for the students.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.389
The best for the students
or the best for your bottom line?

33:44.455 --> 33:46.724
I ask because I did some research

33:46.791 --> 33:50.561
and found that you made an investment
in the initial round of funding

33:50.628 --> 33:52.463
for De Novo charter schools.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.766
- How...?
- A small investment, which today

33:55.166 --> 33:58.236
is worth several million dollars.
I'd say that's quite a stake

33:58.302 --> 34:00.271
and also a conflict of interest.

34:00.338 --> 34:04.575
Was that investment the reason you opted
to run for the school board seat?

34:05.476 --> 34:06.978
I have nothing more to say to you.

34:07.044 --> 34:09.714
I think the students at Leland High
deserve an explanation.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.048
Don't you?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.754
Kara, a package came for you.

34:16.821 --> 34:17.822
Thanks, Huff.

34:50.721 --> 34:52.089
He never ceases to amaze me.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.892
That guy had every reason in the world
not to come back here

34:54.959 --> 34:56.227
and make a fool of himself.

34:56.294 --> 34:58.529
Never underestimate the power
of being on air.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.097
It's like a drug.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.732
Still, what was he thinking?

35:01.799 --> 35:04.068
Maybe it was a run for Mayor
or State Senator,

35:04.135 --> 35:07.338
- figured he'd get some free publicity.
- Everyone knows his name now.

35:07.672 --> 35:10.408
Do you think kids like Jacy
from the protest watched?

35:11.142 --> 35:12.443
- Of course.
- Yeah?

35:16.247 --> 35:17.415
Okay.

35:19.784 --> 35:20.885
Well...

35:21.886 --> 35:23.621
Everybody knows your name too now.

35:23.888 --> 35:26.557
I think keeping our lives private
may not be possible.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.459
What if I have a problem with this?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.394
Do you have a problem with this?

35:31.529 --> 35:33.397
Okay, I'm a journalist.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.033
I live by the mantra
that I cover the story,

35:36.100 --> 35:37.268
I don't become the story.

35:37.335 --> 35:41.072
I want to do serious news,
I don't want to be a sideshow.

35:41.138 --> 35:43.641
I'm right there with you.
But facing the limelight,

35:43.708 --> 35:46.244
that comes with the territory.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.014
Alright.

35:50.081 --> 35:54.018
All I'm asking
is that maybe we can do both.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.053
Is that alright?

35:56.687 --> 35:57.755
Yeah.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.056
Let's do both.

36:00.758 --> 36:05.129
Now, can we order lunch in today?

36:06.230 --> 36:07.231
Italian?

36:30.655 --> 36:32.557
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.826
I'm calling because Niecy told me
about you and Justin.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.262
<i>- Justin?
- Your new boyfriend.</i>

36:38.996 --> 36:40.798
<i>The one you left Lee for.</i>

36:40.865 --> 36:43.968
Don't go blaming Niecy
for spilling the tea, because...

36:47.338 --> 36:50.441
Pauletta, why did you do it?

36:50.908 --> 36:51.943
Mom...

36:53.177 --> 36:56.247
Justin lit a fire in me
in a way that Lee just didn't.

36:56.647 --> 36:58.983
And I know you told me
not to ruin things with Lee,

36:59.050 --> 37:01.752
because he's loyal
and husband material, etc.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.054
And I agree, but...

37:03.588 --> 37:06.357
When push comes to shove,
I don't want to spend the rest of my life

37:06.757 --> 37:08.125
with someone who doesn't

37:09.060 --> 37:11.762
<i>light that fire in me, you know?</i>

37:12.296 --> 37:14.231
And besides, I feel like...

37:14.298 --> 37:16.567
Like Justin and I are more compatible.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.869
- He is...
- Complicated.

37:20.538 --> 37:21.572
Like you.

37:22.974 --> 37:23.941
Yeah.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.777
- Yeah, but he's...
- I understand.

37:27.278 --> 37:29.013
You don't have to explain anymore.

37:31.148 --> 37:34.385
Wow, that is not the response
that I was expecting.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.188
I just wanted to know the truth
coming from you.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.724
No lecture? No judgement?

37:40.291 --> 37:41.626
<i>Not from me.</i>

37:41.692 --> 37:42.793
Not today.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.363
And thank you.

37:47.264 --> 37:49.333
<i>- For what?
- For your honesty.</i>

37:49.800 --> 37:52.236
You're lucky
that you know yourself so well.

37:53.037 --> 37:55.272
Not all of us are so fortunate.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.408
<i>Are you okay, Mom? You sound...</i>

37:57.475 --> 38:00.111
<i>- Different.
- Yes, I'm fine, sweetie.</i>

38:01.112 --> 38:04.382
You take care and have a beautiful day.

38:26.070 --> 38:29.540
You're a straight out son of a bitch,
Frank Pearl.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.510
You show up at my house,

38:32.576 --> 38:34.612
and barely say two words to me?

38:36.714 --> 38:39.650
- I figured that's what you wanted.
- What I want is an apology.

38:40.551 --> 38:44.855
I was all set
to start a life with you 44 years ago.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.357
Come on, Helen.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.426
We both know why that didn't happen.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.495
What do you want me to say?

38:57.802 --> 38:58.803
Nothing.

39:00.638 --> 39:02.073
I've said my piece

39:02.139 --> 39:05.509
and it's probably best
to leave it all in the past.

39:11.749 --> 39:12.817
They're still out there?

39:14.418 --> 39:16.087
You want to take separate doors or...?

39:16.153 --> 39:19.457
Tell me, this hashtag WhoisJustin,
is it still trending?

39:20.024 --> 39:21.158
Yes.

39:21.225 --> 39:22.793
And the crazy video with Dani?

39:23.127 --> 39:24.195
That too.

39:24.929 --> 39:26.063
If we do this,

39:26.330 --> 39:28.199
can we turn the focus
back to the protest,

39:28.265 --> 39:29.667
to what happened at the school?

39:30.034 --> 39:31.001
Possibly.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.571
But we'll have the spotlight,
so we can take it there.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.374
So, we go out together.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.077
You ready?

39:40.144 --> 39:41.278
Yes. Are you?

39:43.147 --> 39:45.116
We can use this for good, Justin.

39:45.449 --> 39:46.417
Yeah.

39:47.151 --> 39:48.953
You're playing with my career.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.489
And it takes a lifetime
to build a reputation

39:51.555 --> 39:53.457
and five minutes to ruin it forever,

39:53.524 --> 39:56.260
- and this is my livelihood.
- I promise you, whatever happens,

39:57.027 --> 39:58.629
I take full responsibility, okay?

39:58.963 --> 39:59.930
Okay.
