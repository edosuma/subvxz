00:43.916 --> 00:46.375
From time immemorial,

00:46.416 --> 00:48.458
the ancient Ukrainian forest

00:48.500 --> 00:51.791
has harboured amazing secrets
and mysteries.

00:51.833 --> 00:54.625
Behind the Dark Mountain,

00:54.666 --> 00:56.250
in the forest's heart,

00:56.291 --> 00:58.541
the Source of Life is hidden.

00:58.583 --> 01:01.916
It provides the forest
and its dwellers

01:01.958 --> 01:04.750
with their power, their spark.

01:04.791 --> 01:07.291
But one winter,

01:07.333 --> 01:10.166
while the forest
was fast asleep,

01:10.208 --> 01:12.791
with the guardian alone
watching over it,

01:12.833 --> 01:16.083
a human broke into the forest

01:16.125 --> 01:18.375
through the passage
in the Dark Mountain.

01:18.416 --> 01:21.208
It was the owner of the sawmill.

01:21.250 --> 01:25.416
He needed at least one drop
from the Source of Life

01:25.458 --> 01:28.458
to save his dying
newborn daughter.

01:28.500 --> 01:32.875
But then he returned
and brought an army with him,

01:32.916 --> 01:36.458
hoping to take over
the entire Source for himself.

01:36.500 --> 01:39.833
And so a terrible battle began

01:39.875 --> 01:41.458
that left no winners.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.750
Only losers.

01:43.791 --> 01:46.291
All humans who had trespassed

01:46.333 --> 01:49.166
behind the Dark Mountain
vanished.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.208
The Forest Guardian

01:52.250 --> 01:56.458
lost all but an echo
of his ancient strength.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.375
And when the forest creatures
woke in the spring,

02:00.416 --> 02:03.750
they were greeted by
the horrific consequences

02:03.791 --> 02:05.625
of the humans' treachery.

02:07.083 --> 02:10.041
Look at what
our enemies have done.

02:10.083 --> 02:12.083
For this reason,

02:12.125 --> 02:15.000
no human shall set foot

02:15.041 --> 02:18.666
behind the Dark Mountain
ever again!

02:18.708 --> 02:21.916
This is the new forest law.

02:24.833 --> 02:28.166
Many years have passed
since that day.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.708
Another winter is over.

02:55.750 --> 02:58.708
Oh, I've slept so long.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.708
I was having
the loveliest dream.

03:06.125 --> 03:09.666
But this is better
than any dream.

03:20.791 --> 03:24.166
It's finally spring.

03:53.750 --> 03:56.375
Swampy!

03:56.416 --> 03:59.416
It's the best part
of the best day of the year.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.875
Time to wake up the forest.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.583
Hark! Hush, the master
of sounds, approaches.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.791
Happy spring, Mavka!

05:29.833 --> 05:32.583
Hush! You can fly?!

05:32.625 --> 05:35.208
That's kind of huge news.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.416
They'll call me Hush,
who conquered the sky!

05:38.458 --> 05:40.166
Just don't tell Lesh.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.750
He'll think
I'm stork-raving mad.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.500
Whoa!

06:53.250 --> 06:56.125
Yeah! One more! More!

06:56.166 --> 06:58.250
And the fans go wild!

06:58.291 --> 07:01.208
We are so ready
to conquer the world.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.250
Settle down, kid.
Hometown crowd.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.000
Everybody knows us here.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.333
Wow, I'm just so nervous.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.125
What if things don't work out
in the city?

07:10.166 --> 07:13.041
There are so many
other musicians there.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.125
You have to believe
in yourself, Nina,

07:15.166 --> 07:17.125
and let the music
show us the way.

07:17.166 --> 07:20.041
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.166
What was that?

07:33.125 --> 07:35.291
"Big money
for an important job?"

07:35.333 --> 07:38.583
Hm, not for a soon-to-be
musical legend like me.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.791
But maybe Uncle Leo
can use this.

07:40.833 --> 07:43.250
Lucas, your uncle,

07:43.291 --> 07:45.083
he's not feeling well.

07:45.125 --> 07:47.083
They called the healer
and everything.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.083
Get home, quick.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.875
Hopefully we'll see you
at the fair later.

07:56.916 --> 07:59.166
-Hey, look!
-What is it?

08:14.291 --> 08:15.875
Greetings,

08:15.916 --> 08:19.333
after so long,
my dear fellow villagers.

08:19.375 --> 08:21.500
It is I, Kylina,

08:21.541 --> 08:25.916
the daughter and only heiress
of the late sawmill owner.

08:25.958 --> 08:29.541
The one that got burned up
by forest demons?

08:29.583 --> 08:32.750
Yes, my father died tragically

08:32.791 --> 08:35.166
in a forest wildfire,

08:35.208 --> 08:38.875
but it had nothing to do
with your quaint superstitions.

08:38.916 --> 08:42.750
After dear Daddy's death,
my mother and I left this place,

08:42.791 --> 08:46.041
but soon I became an orphan.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.958
-Oh, poor thing. What a shame.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.208
How positively tragic!

08:53.291 --> 08:57.833
But now I am back to make
our village prosperous again.

08:57.875 --> 09:00.708
I'm offering you all a job.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.458
You'll have so much money

09:02.500 --> 09:04.916
that you'll never
have to work again.

09:04.958 --> 09:07.000
Not working is my dream job.

09:07.041 --> 09:09.458
I'll rebuild the sawmill.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.916
We'll start selling our timber
all around the world.

09:12.958 --> 09:17.291
Aren't you all good and ready
to become rich and happy?

09:17.333 --> 09:18.375
-Yeah!
-Absolutely.

09:18.416 --> 09:20.291
-Yes!
-What do you want us to do?

09:20.333 --> 09:23.250
All you have to do is pop over
the Dark Mountain...

09:23.291 --> 09:25.625
What?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.416
Oh, she's cuckoo.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.958
Ugh, just like her father.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.750
But I'm talking huge money.

09:32.791 --> 09:35.166
You can't buy another life.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.583
Tell the evil spirits I said hi.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.916
-What's that?

10:03.166 --> 10:05.083
Easy, easy.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.583
What's the matter?

10:16.416 --> 10:17.875
A trap!

10:17.916 --> 10:19.750
Probably left
from the old times.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.333
Huh?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.708
Huh?

10:53.791 --> 10:56.000
The guardian is calling us.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.208
Uh, how is he?

11:01.250 --> 11:05.416
He's holding on, but my herbs
can only do so much.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.708
Leo needs real medicine
from the city.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.666
But...it's not going
to be cheap.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.041
Uh...

11:16.166 --> 11:19.166
"Per-du-cabri-co-carum"?

11:19.208 --> 11:22.291
Just give this to the pharmacist
in the city.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.875
He'll understand.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.875
Thank you. Sincerely.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.041
Great news, Uncle.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.958
A little perdi-caca-something-um

11:33.000 --> 11:35.166
and you'll be good as new.

11:38.916 --> 11:42.458
Lucas, what are you doing?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.583
You can't waste
your money on me.

11:44.625 --> 11:49.166
I'm old and I've had
a good long run.

11:52.416 --> 11:56.625
Spend it on a nice girl,
get settled down...

11:56.666 --> 12:00.541
..so your old uncle
can die in peace.

12:02.291 --> 12:04.000
Nobody's going to D-word.

12:04.041 --> 12:06.958
I'll find the money
some...where.

12:08.958 --> 12:13.375
Uncle, you'll be fine.
I've got you.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.583
-I've got you!

12:31.416 --> 12:33.625
Oh, madam,
it's your family mansion.

12:33.666 --> 12:35.708
How...rustic.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.041
Ugh, it's just
a revolting hovel.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.250
A bunch of pathetic cowards!

12:43.291 --> 12:45.666
All my plans are at risk

12:45.708 --> 12:49.500
just because this primitive mob
is terrified by the forest.

12:49.541 --> 12:51.708
-Move it, Frol!

12:51.750 --> 12:55.375
Oh, ma'am. Right away.
Just a second.

12:55.416 --> 12:59.833
Do me a favour and get
these peasant rags off me.

12:59.875 --> 13:02.833
How can they wear
this hideous stuff?!

13:02.875 --> 13:06.166
Ugh, I hate it.
Get rid of it right away.

13:06.208 --> 13:10.041
What a terrible piece
of tasteless trash.

13:10.083 --> 13:11.958
Stupid, uneducated,
superstitious mob.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.375
-Frol!
-Oh, my God.

13:15.416 --> 13:16.875
This is so old-fashioned.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.708
Don't get me upset, Frol.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.500
It's bad for my complexion.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.666
Oh, sure, madam.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.250
-Oh!

13:35.416 --> 13:38.041
Clumsy idiots!

13:39.333 --> 13:41.125
Inside this case is...

13:43.625 --> 13:44.958
Just be careful with it.

13:46.625 --> 13:47.791
Mm?

13:47.833 --> 13:50.166
What is it?

13:50.208 --> 13:51.750
Uh, about this job offer...

13:51.791 --> 13:53.041
Oh, forget it.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.458
Who's there?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.916
Frol!

13:57.416 --> 13:59.583
Oh, about THAT job offer?

13:59.625 --> 14:01.041
Please come in.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.708
Hi. My name's Lucas.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.291
It says you'll pay well.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.666
Hmm.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.333
Hmm.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.375
I will.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.208
If you're up to it.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.541
Uh, I am.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.125
I can do any job.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.375
Good.

14:32.416 --> 14:35.375
Eric, Derek, you go with him.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.833
So...what do I have to do?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.125
Find me the tree with this leaf.

14:45.541 --> 14:46.750
Uh... Huh!

14:46.791 --> 14:50.166
In the forest
behind the Dark Mountain.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.166
Hmm.

14:56.416 --> 14:57.791
FOREST-DWELLER: What happened?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.833
The guardian
is summoning everybody?

14:59.875 --> 15:02.958
This hasn't happened
since I was a sapling.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.750
-I'd rather take a nap.
-The guardian?!

15:11.250 --> 15:14.708
Greetings upon the new spring,

15:14.750 --> 15:17.958
my fellow forest-dwellers.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.958
Is everyone here?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.666
Mavka, did you wake
everybody up?

15:30.916 --> 15:32.916
She's probably frolicking

15:32.958 --> 15:35.791
through the crocuses
with Swampy again.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.458
-I'm sorry I'm late, Guardian.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.083
I was helping the lynx cub
get out of an old trap.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.000
-How terrible!
-An old trap.

15:46.041 --> 15:48.500
I thought they were
all removed after the battle?

15:48.541 --> 15:50.166
Nymphs.

15:50.208 --> 15:53.416
You are
the forest's armed forces.

15:53.458 --> 15:56.208
Which one of you missed this?

15:58.041 --> 15:59.916
Good job, Mavka.

15:59.958 --> 16:02.208
You've embarrassed us
in front of the guardian.

16:20.666 --> 16:22.166
Now, then,

16:22.208 --> 16:25.125
listen, forest-dwellers.

16:25.166 --> 16:28.166
The Supreme Spirits of Nature

16:28.208 --> 16:32.541
whisper that dangerous times
approach.

16:32.583 --> 16:36.208
Therefore, at midnight tonight,

16:36.250 --> 16:38.375
in the heart of the forest,

16:38.416 --> 16:43.500
the spirits shall choose
a new guardian.

16:43.541 --> 16:46.666
Lesh, but what about you?

16:46.708 --> 16:49.625
I have so little strength left.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.625
The guardian's burden

16:51.666 --> 16:54.625
has grown too heavy for me.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.583
Lesh won't be
the guardian anymore?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.583
Will the humans attack us again?

17:00.625 --> 17:04.125
-Who else can protect us?
Hark.

17:04.166 --> 17:08.208
Hush the sky conqueror
can become the guardian.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.583
Guardian chatterbox?

17:11.625 --> 17:13.625
Yeah, just what we need.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.625
I heard that.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.750
But really, anyone
can become the guardian.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.833
You mean like even you?

17:20.875 --> 17:22.583
No, no, no, Mavka.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.708
You may be the sweet,
pure soul of the forest,

17:25.750 --> 17:29.416
but for this job
you are just way too nice.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.791
No, I'm not.

17:30.833 --> 17:33.416
Ooh. I feel unwell.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.000
Ondina, are you alright?

17:35.041 --> 17:38.333
See? So gullible and nice!

17:39.666 --> 17:40.958
Enough!

17:41.000 --> 17:44.291
All will be decided at midnight

17:44.333 --> 17:47.291
in the heart of the forest.

17:52.416 --> 17:54.666
People say that
behind the Dark Mountain,

17:54.708 --> 17:57.750
the water nymphs and tree
spirits can tickle you to death.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.833
Uh, you're laughing and laughing

18:00.875 --> 18:03.083
and then bleugh!

18:03.125 --> 18:06.666
We don't believe in monsters
of the forest.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.375
Where do we go from here?

18:09.416 --> 18:11.875
I think through this way.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.791
Uh...

18:34.208 --> 18:35.500
Uh-huh.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.625
I didn't think we came here
to hunt.

18:37.666 --> 18:40.208
This isn't hunting.

18:43.458 --> 18:46.125
This is fun.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.083
-Yeah.

18:56.041 --> 18:57.625
Impossible.

18:57.666 --> 18:59.875
Today of all days.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.583
It was an accident. I tripped.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.958
I am extremely clumsy.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.875
My childhood nickname was
Clumsy Lucas.

19:19.916 --> 19:23.833
We'll make you
Clumsy Black-and-Blue-cus.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.208
Mm-hm.

19:27.250 --> 19:31.083
My brother thinks
you should go on by yourself.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.500
If you find the tree,
mark it on the map.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.375
OK.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.083
I was gonna suggest that anyway.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.125
I feel their fear.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.916
Quiet down.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.750
Everything is fine now.

21:10.958 --> 21:13.291
What scared you so much?

21:16.791 --> 21:18.875
Humans? Here?

21:18.916 --> 21:20.750
I have to tell the nymphs.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.208
Wait.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.916
Come on, Swampy.

21:23.958 --> 21:25.958
I'll deal
with the humans myself.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.750
Let's show them how 'nice' I am.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.791
Argh!

22:03.833 --> 22:06.916
Where in the haunted heck
is this tree?

22:11.041 --> 22:13.291
Believe in yourself, Lucas.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.250
Let the music show you the way.

22:17.833 --> 22:20.166
Whatever that means.

22:42.791 --> 22:44.125
Ohh!

22:49.583 --> 22:52.375
It's so beautiful.

22:52.416 --> 22:54.416
Oh, thanks. I...

22:54.458 --> 22:56.125
Uhh...

22:57.458 --> 22:58.916
Argh!

22:58.958 --> 23:01.000
-Argh!

23:01.041 --> 23:03.083
Forest demon!

23:03.125 --> 23:04.333
Argh!

23:08.708 --> 23:10.291
Is the human dead?

23:34.875 --> 23:38.875
Is this some sort
of human magic?

23:40.416 --> 23:42.041
Mavka!

23:42.083 --> 23:43.916
A lot of weird, whistly,
raspy sounds

23:43.958 --> 23:46.416
coming from this exact area
and I...

23:46.458 --> 23:48.416
-Uh, Hush.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.875
You already learned
how to dismount the stork.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.333
Nice.

23:52.375 --> 23:54.458
I am on high alert.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.666
Our forest has just been
incursion-ated by...

23:57.708 --> 24:00.583
Argh! THE HUMANS!

24:00.625 --> 24:02.750
I'll watch him.
You go get the nymphs.

24:02.791 --> 24:03.875
Oh, no.

24:03.916 --> 24:05.625
I say we can drive the human

24:05.666 --> 24:07.375
out of the forest on our own.

24:07.416 --> 24:10.458
So I would be Hush, the first
kicker-outer of humans?

24:10.500 --> 24:12.333
Oh, I like that very much.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.208
-Argh!

24:22.000 --> 24:24.250
Uh... Argh! Evil spirits.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.500
Keep back, I'm warning you.

24:26.541 --> 24:30.083
I... I'm a...borscht belt
in combat polka.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.500
Pathetic little human!

24:32.541 --> 24:34.041
You violated
our sacred forest...

24:34.083 --> 24:35.291
Huh?!

24:35.333 --> 24:37.833
..and tried to harm
these noble bison.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.875
No! Super no.

24:39.916 --> 24:41.875
That was the bouncer brothers.

24:41.916 --> 24:44.208
In fact, I saved
the bison from them!

24:44.250 --> 24:46.000
What is this, then?

24:46.041 --> 24:47.833
Oh. That's my flute.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.541
I, uh, play my music on it...
with it.

24:50.583 --> 24:52.708
'Music'?

24:52.750 --> 24:54.625
And you were doing this

24:54.666 --> 24:56.583
to try and magically
enchant me in some way?

24:56.625 --> 24:58.791
No! Well, sure.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.791
Music is kind of magic, but...

25:00.833 --> 25:03.458
Wait, so you liked it, then?

25:03.500 --> 25:06.916
You do not question me,
little human!

25:06.958 --> 25:08.833
Why have you trespassed here?

25:08.875 --> 25:12.916
A strange lady offered me a big
reward to find a special leaf.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.916
Aha! You hear that? A reward!

25:15.958 --> 25:18.333
I knew that all humans
were selfish and greedy!

25:18.375 --> 25:20.250
-Why you little...

25:20.291 --> 25:22.500
-Ouch.

25:30.416 --> 25:33.750
You see this!
Human treachery!

25:36.375 --> 25:37.875
Huh?

25:40.666 --> 25:42.291
Wow!

25:42.333 --> 25:45.583
You are the most amazingly
beautiful demon

25:45.625 --> 25:48.041
I have ever seen.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.833
Your eyes.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.291
I am not a demon.

25:51.333 --> 25:54.791
I am Mavka,
the soul of the forest.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.125
Well, I'm Lucas.

25:57.166 --> 26:00.166
The soul of...myself?

26:01.416 --> 26:03.375
Look, I can explain.

26:03.416 --> 26:06.416
I need that reward to buy
medicine for my uncle Leo.

26:06.458 --> 26:10.333
No. I have been warned that
humans are skilful liars.

26:10.375 --> 26:14.125
You have broken the law
of the forest and I expel you!

26:14.166 --> 26:17.791
No expulsion necessary.
I'll leave myself.

26:17.833 --> 26:20.333
Just let me find
this silly leaf first

26:20.375 --> 26:23.000
or else my uncle...

26:23.041 --> 26:24.041
..dies.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.833
How awful. I'm so sorry.

26:27.875 --> 26:29.041
-Whargh!

26:29.083 --> 26:31.458
Hey there, little...

26:31.500 --> 26:33.041
What are you?

26:33.083 --> 26:35.375
This is Swampy,
the last of the kittyfrogs.

26:35.416 --> 26:37.875
Awww!

26:37.916 --> 26:39.708
It's so cute how much
he hates me.

26:39.750 --> 26:40.875
-Oh!

26:40.916 --> 26:42.791
You want something super yummy?

26:48.416 --> 26:50.791
Had a feeling you'd like that.

26:50.833 --> 26:53.750
You're very different
from the evil humans

26:53.791 --> 26:56.166
in all the forest legends.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.333
-Huh?

27:41.416 --> 27:42.750
Huh?

27:46.875 --> 27:48.833
Derek, hold my boomstick.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.583
Derek?

27:53.750 --> 27:55.916
Derek? Where are you?

27:57.916 --> 28:00.250
I'll teach you,
you filthy human!

28:00.291 --> 28:01.875
Hush, what are you doing?

28:01.916 --> 28:04.125
Swampy, spit it out immediately!

28:04.166 --> 28:07.541
This grotty fleshbag
is trying to poison you.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.500
Hey! It's my mother's recipe.

28:09.541 --> 28:11.750
Oh, Mommy
poisons folks too, huh?

28:14.750 --> 28:16.166
Hush, stop!

28:17.333 --> 28:19.000
Lucas, leave him alone.

28:19.041 --> 28:22.000
-Huh?
-You gave it a name already?

28:26.083 --> 28:28.458
Lucas. Stop it right now!

28:32.708 --> 28:35.875
Well, he started it.
He has to leave.

28:35.916 --> 28:37.416
I need the leaf.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.708
Fine, here's a leaf. Now leave.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.125
Not this one.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.875
Are all humans this picky?

28:42.916 --> 28:45.708
Lucas. It's not the leaves
you really need.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.541
You need to heal your uncle

28:47.583 --> 28:49.875
and I'll give you
the cure he needs.

28:49.916 --> 28:51.166
Really?!

28:51.208 --> 28:53.916
Oh, thank you. You are so nice.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.291
Hey, hey, hey.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.791
Do you really want
to break the law

28:56.833 --> 28:59.333
to help a human on such a day?

28:59.375 --> 29:01.041
You heard him.

29:01.083 --> 29:02.875
He saved the bison,

29:02.916 --> 29:06.416
and for some reason...
I believe him.

29:06.458 --> 29:08.250
-Urgh!

29:08.291 --> 29:11.625
After all,
the soul of the forest

29:11.666 --> 29:14.583
must help all the living
creatures in the forest, right?

29:14.625 --> 29:17.250
And Lucas is a living creature
who is in the forest.

29:17.291 --> 29:19.000
-Huh?
-Therefore, I have to help him.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.625
And you will help me help him.

29:21.666 --> 29:23.083
Me?

29:23.125 --> 29:24.500
No way! Never!

29:24.541 --> 29:26.583
Never, never, never, never,
never, never, never!

29:26.625 --> 29:28.541
-No!

29:28.583 --> 29:33.291
When will I learn that I'm
incapable of saying no to you?

29:33.333 --> 29:37.500
Don't worry, Hush. We'll make it
before the ceremony starts.

29:37.541 --> 29:40.208
I'll give Lucas the cure
for his uncle and...

29:40.250 --> 29:42.625
And then he'll leave
the forest forever.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.583
I promise.

29:47.583 --> 29:49.000
Hmm?

29:49.041 --> 29:51.791
Come to me!

29:51.833 --> 29:56.250
Don't be shy. Come closer.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.083
Ahhh!

30:12.291 --> 30:13.500
Huh?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.791
Argh!

30:21.000 --> 30:22.875
How did I...

30:22.916 --> 30:24.541
Curses!

30:29.708 --> 30:31.125
-Uh...

30:31.166 --> 30:32.500
Oh.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.458
Mm.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.041
Huh?

30:41.750 --> 30:45.208
Mavka, how can I thank you
for your help?

30:45.250 --> 30:48.083
Just tell me and I'll do it
with pleasure.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.500
Maybe you could play
your music for me?

30:51.541 --> 30:53.250
Oh. Sure thing.

30:54.708 --> 30:56.708
No, no, no, not now.

30:56.750 --> 30:58.000
Nobody can know you're here.

30:58.041 --> 30:59.958
No, let him play.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.833
The nymphs will hide him
safely in the forest,

31:02.875 --> 31:05.958

33:00.541 --> 33:03.125
We have a lot of nice things.

33:03.166 --> 33:06.291
Like music. It's so lovely.

33:06.333 --> 33:09.541
You must be the guardian
of music in your world.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.416
Not yet.

33:11.458 --> 33:14.833
But my dream is to fill
my whole life with music.

33:14.875 --> 33:17.083
As soon as my uncle gets better,

33:17.125 --> 33:20.250
my musician friends and I are
leaving for the big city.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.583
"The big city".

33:22.625 --> 33:25.416
What is the big city?

33:25.458 --> 33:29.708
It's a place where everything
is made of bricks and stone

33:29.750 --> 33:31.416
and there are as many buildings

33:31.458 --> 33:32.875
as there are trees
in the forest...

33:32.916 --> 33:34.708
Hurry up, hurry up. Move!

33:34.750 --> 33:36.708
What are you doing?
Back off, shrubby.

33:36.750 --> 33:40.000
Hush! Mavka!

33:40.041 --> 33:43.500
Are you the ones
making all this noise?

33:43.541 --> 33:45.416
Too late.

33:45.458 --> 33:46.791
Nice knowing you, Mavka.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.708
Up until today, anyway.

33:49.750 --> 33:51.916
Lesh, how's it going?

33:51.958 --> 33:54.250
Busier than I'd like.

33:54.291 --> 33:57.166
Who is your guest?

33:57.208 --> 34:01.083
Uh, I'm...Hush's...cousin.

34:01.125 --> 34:03.875
Yes, dropped by
for a visit from overseas.

34:03.916 --> 34:06.083
Right, Hush?

34:07.458 --> 34:09.875
Uh-huh.

34:09.916 --> 34:13.666
A very, very
many-times-removed cousin.

34:13.708 --> 34:17.041
Shmucas is his name.

34:17.083 --> 34:20.500
Ah! Welcome, friend Shmucas.

34:20.541 --> 34:24.791
Come quickly.
The ceremony is about to begin.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.125
Oh, great. What do we do now?

34:30.166 --> 34:33.041
Do you realise how illegal
this is?

34:33.083 --> 34:36.458
We just need to keep our
distance from the new guardian.

34:36.500 --> 34:40.250
As soon as the ceremony is over,
I'll come up with something.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.583
You look just like
your parents, madam.

34:51.916 --> 34:54.708
Hm, much better now.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.041
Yeah. Lovely portrait.

34:57.083 --> 34:58.958
Totally...horridness.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.041
Hmm?

35:07.125 --> 35:09.166
Hmm. Did you find the tree?

35:12.833 --> 35:14.583
So what stopped you?

35:14.625 --> 35:17.791
Bunnies? Squirrels?
The forest demons?

35:20.833 --> 35:22.583
Knuckleheads.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.833
Totally useless. Oh!

35:25.875 --> 35:28.041
Stop being such fools.

35:28.083 --> 35:29.958
You are stupid idiots.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.791
What am I paying you for?

35:31.833 --> 35:34.833
And where is the boy?

35:37.166 --> 35:38.416
Oh!

35:39.916 --> 35:41.458
-Out of my way.

36:11.250 --> 36:12.500
Oh!

36:14.750 --> 36:16.916
Oh, damn!

36:18.125 --> 36:19.833
I'm running out of time.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.791
And where is this peasant loser?

36:51.500 --> 36:52.750
Ohhh! Oh!

37:05.125 --> 37:07.166
-Hey.

37:07.208 --> 37:08.541
Shhh!

37:14.125 --> 37:15.708
It is time.

37:16.958 --> 37:18.000
Hmm!

37:24.083 --> 37:26.250
Oh! That's the...

37:26.291 --> 37:29.583
The Supreme Spirits of Nature,

37:29.625 --> 37:32.833
I summon you.

37:32.875 --> 37:36.250
The One Who Dwells in the Earth,

37:36.291 --> 37:38.750
I call on you.

37:43.916 --> 37:47.541
The One Who Moves the Waters,

37:47.583 --> 37:50.875
I call on you.

37:54.916 --> 37:57.958
The One Who Flies
with the Wind...

38:00.958 --> 38:03.541
..the One Who Sits
on the Rock...

38:03.583 --> 38:06.666
..I call on you.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.625
Those who protect us,

38:11.666 --> 38:13.916
those who help us,

38:13.958 --> 38:17.291
those who dwell
at the Source of Life,

38:17.333 --> 38:21.916
please choose the new guardian.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.416
Mm.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.625
Hmm?

38:59.208 --> 39:01.916
The guardian is chosen.

39:01.958 --> 39:03.250
Huh?

39:03.291 --> 39:05.041
-Her?
-Me?

39:07.750 --> 39:10.125
What's happening?
Is it good or bad?

39:10.166 --> 39:13.500
Please close the knothole
on the front of your face.

39:13.541 --> 39:15.916
Lesh, why me?

39:15.958 --> 39:18.333
I can't possibly be
the guardian.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.208
I have to tell you something.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.333
The Supreme Spirits are wise,

39:23.375 --> 39:28.375
and they know who is capable
of protecting our realm.

39:28.416 --> 39:31.208
Now the Supreme Spirits

39:31.250 --> 39:35.791
will bestow their powers
on the chosen one.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.041
-Incredible.
-Perfect.

41:04.083 --> 41:08.541
So how do we "keep our distance
from the new guardian" now?

41:10.500 --> 41:14.291
Mavka, you are now granted

41:14.333 --> 41:18.875
the powers of
the Supreme Spirits of Nature.

41:18.916 --> 41:20.791
It is for you now

41:20.833 --> 41:24.166
to always remember
that our enemy -

41:24.208 --> 41:27.750
the humans - are out there.

41:27.791 --> 41:31.416
Defend this fragile,
sacred place

41:31.458 --> 41:33.583
with your very life.

41:33.625 --> 41:38.041
Please welcome our new guardian

41:38.083 --> 41:41.375
of the Source of Life
and the forest.

41:51.875 --> 41:54.875
That was just...whoa!

41:54.916 --> 41:57.875
Our little Mavka
is now the guardian.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.083
I always knew this would happen.

42:02.708 --> 42:05.000
There has got
to be some mistake.

42:05.041 --> 42:07.708
Why did the spirits not choose
the strongest one?

42:07.750 --> 42:09.541
With her as guardian,

42:09.583 --> 42:12.250
our forest is more in danger
than ever.

42:12.291 --> 42:14.375
Hey. Easy there, friend.

42:14.416 --> 42:17.000
Who are you supposed to be?

42:17.041 --> 42:19.583
Me? I am, uh, Hush's cousin.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.583
You...

42:21.625 --> 42:24.291
You stink like a human.

42:24.333 --> 42:28.416
Yeah, he stepped in some human
on the way here.

42:28.458 --> 42:30.666
Uh, Cousin Shmucas.

42:30.708 --> 42:32.833
If he's a noise keeper,

42:32.875 --> 42:35.208
I'm the new guardian
of the forest.

42:35.250 --> 42:36.500
And we all know...

42:36.541 --> 42:38.333
-..I'm not.

42:39.708 --> 42:41.625
-Uh...oops.

42:41.666 --> 42:44.041
Human?!

42:44.083 --> 42:46.750
Run. Move your footsticks.

42:46.791 --> 42:50.916
You treacherous human.
You have tricked me!

42:50.958 --> 42:53.083
-Human?
-Oh, no, he's a human.

42:58.041 --> 42:59.791
Don't let him get away!

42:59.833 --> 43:02.541
Am I the only one here
who's completely confused?

43:02.583 --> 43:04.291
Hush!

43:04.333 --> 43:09.333
You've got a great deal
of explaining to do.

43:15.458 --> 43:17.416
Argh!

43:20.083 --> 43:22.166
-Huh?

43:22.208 --> 43:23.541
Argh!

43:44.291 --> 43:45.791
Argh!

43:56.166 --> 43:59.041
Argh!

44:05.125 --> 44:06.958
Argh!

44:13.666 --> 44:16.166
-Mavka.
-Get on, quick.

44:16.208 --> 44:17.541
The lynx will take you home.

44:17.583 --> 44:20.583
Whoa! Sounds safe.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.416
Nice...kitty.

44:22.458 --> 44:23.791
Take this.

44:23.833 --> 44:26.041
It will heal your uncle.

44:28.375 --> 44:30.000
Thank you.

44:30.041 --> 44:31.708
-Huh?

44:33.166 --> 44:35.666
There's no time.
Go...and never return.

44:35.708 --> 44:38.083
Death is the only thing
for a human to seek here.

44:38.125 --> 44:40.500
-Go!
-Wait!

44:40.541 --> 44:42.083
I promised I'd play for you.

44:43.625 --> 44:46.291
Where is he? Where's the human?

44:46.333 --> 44:47.916
He got away.

44:49.166 --> 44:50.833
What? How did he...

44:52.000 --> 44:53.750
You helped him?

44:53.791 --> 44:56.000
You have the powers
of the guardian

44:56.041 --> 44:58.000
at your disposal,
you could have -

44:58.041 --> 45:01.375
no, you should have -
stopped him.

45:01.416 --> 45:03.666
The guardian
doesn't need your help

45:03.708 --> 45:06.625
deciding how and when
to use her powers, Ondina.

45:06.666 --> 45:08.333
Mavka,

45:08.375 --> 45:11.375
this human is no different
than all the others.

45:11.416 --> 45:13.208
He will betray you.

45:13.250 --> 45:17.666
And when he does,
we will all pay the price.

45:37.291 --> 45:38.791
Hmm.

45:47.916 --> 45:49.250
Frol!

45:49.291 --> 45:51.416
Yes, madam?

45:51.458 --> 45:54.833
There's something
about this boy Lucas

45:54.875 --> 45:57.125
I don't trust.

45:57.166 --> 45:58.500
Watch him.

45:58.541 --> 46:00.125
I'm not so sure

46:00.166 --> 46:03.125
he came back from the forest
empty-handed.

46:03.166 --> 46:04.375
Me?!

46:04.416 --> 46:07.541
Madam, I am a fashion tsar
in the making,

46:07.583 --> 46:09.458
not a spy.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.875
Oh, that's too bad.

46:11.916 --> 46:15.083
If I get what I want,
I could establish you

46:15.125 --> 46:17.666
as the number one fashion god...

46:17.708 --> 46:19.625
..in the world.

46:19.666 --> 46:24.333
With my own Soul of Frol
Manly Lace Boutique?

46:24.375 --> 46:26.416
With a global chain

46:26.458 --> 46:29.708
of whatever insane thing
you just said.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.708
Then, if you need a spy,

46:32.750 --> 46:35.208
why, Frol is your guy.

46:44.750 --> 46:47.208
Ugh. Uh!

46:47.250 --> 46:51.750
Silks, ribbons and laces
don't have to be disgraces.

46:51.791 --> 46:53.666
That's the Soul of Frol.

46:56.208 --> 46:59.916
No. This really happened to me.
Last night.

46:59.958 --> 47:04.125
The forest is full of -
not demons - but creatures.

47:04.166 --> 47:06.666
And they are
not fond of us at all.

47:08.833 --> 47:12.208
Except Mavka. She is very nice.

47:17.291 --> 47:19.833
Danger or no,
I have to go back to the forest

47:19.875 --> 47:22.250
to Mavka, to thank her.

47:22.291 --> 47:26.416
Lucas, look, if you've been at
the village fair all night long

47:26.458 --> 47:30.541
and plan on going back,
you can just tell me.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.416
Busted. You know me.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.541
Party animal.

47:34.583 --> 47:36.708
Best carnival ever.

47:47.833 --> 47:49.541
Mmm!

47:58.500 --> 48:00.458
So how is this,

48:00.500 --> 48:04.416
uh, perdi-caca-something-um

48:04.458 --> 48:06.208
supposed to work?

48:06.250 --> 48:08.416
I have less than no idea.

48:10.916 --> 48:13.291
-Huh?

48:20.208 --> 48:22.000
Uncle?

48:24.750 --> 48:26.750
Whoa!

48:26.791 --> 48:29.125
Hah! And no pain.

48:29.166 --> 48:31.916
I haven't stood this straight
in 20 years.

48:31.958 --> 48:34.833
It's a miracle.

48:38.083 --> 48:39.708
It is a miracle.

48:41.916 --> 48:44.625
It's a miracle
of perdi-caca-something-um.

48:44.666 --> 48:47.083
I've got so much energy.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.708
Now I'll be Hercu-Leo.

48:49.750 --> 48:51.750
Hey, let's take up curling.

49:27.166 --> 49:30.041
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

49:33.958 --> 49:37.041
Yeah, it's bit more
complicated now.

49:37.083 --> 49:40.583
But, Swampy, think for yourself.

49:40.625 --> 49:44.083
How can he play his beautiful
music without his flute?

49:46.583 --> 49:48.958
We have to return this to Lucas.

49:53.375 --> 49:56.541
What if something happens
in the forest while I'm gone?

49:58.250 --> 50:00.708
What if nothing happens
while I'm here?

50:00.750 --> 50:02.583
You're absolutely right.

50:02.625 --> 50:05.708
I'm the guardian now.
I can't leave the forest.

50:05.750 --> 50:07.916
Humans are enemies.

50:07.958 --> 50:10.708
I somehow managed to live
without Lucas before.

50:10.750 --> 50:12.541
Or his music.

50:12.583 --> 50:14.125
Or his eyes.

50:14.166 --> 50:15.500
Or his smile.

50:15.541 --> 50:17.541
Or this feeling

50:17.583 --> 50:19.666
that now lives right here.

50:36.625 --> 50:40.791
Hmm. Mmm.

50:40.833 --> 50:44.166
Madam! Madam! Where's Madam?

50:54.916 --> 50:58.750
Madam
is probably upstairs.

50:58.791 --> 51:00.500
-Gah!

51:04.333 --> 51:06.000
Madam! Madam!

51:07.750 --> 51:10.166
Madam, you were right!

51:12.166 --> 51:13.583
Eugh!

51:15.458 --> 51:17.333
That icky boy lied to you!

51:18.375 --> 51:19.541
Here.

51:23.708 --> 51:26.083
Oh.

51:26.125 --> 51:28.625
Lucas was at the Source of Life.

51:29.958 --> 51:32.833
The heart of the forest.

51:32.875 --> 51:36.916
And I also found this.

51:37.916 --> 51:41.125
Finally it will be mine!

51:42.583 --> 51:45.416
But...but there is nothing
marked here!

51:45.458 --> 51:49.166
Now think! Did Lucas
say anything about the tree?

51:49.208 --> 51:50.541
No!

51:50.583 --> 51:52.333
Nothing about the tree,

51:52.375 --> 51:55.750
but he just said
he will go into the forest again

51:55.791 --> 51:57.458
to see the nice forest.

51:57.500 --> 52:00.000
The magma! Boy, what a fool.

52:00.041 --> 52:02.208
It doesn't make sense.

52:02.250 --> 52:04.000
The nice forest magma?

52:04.041 --> 52:06.625
Yeah, that's what he said.

52:06.666 --> 52:10.291
He probably wants to keep
the source to himself.

52:10.333 --> 52:12.708
-Frol.
-Yes, Madam?

52:12.750 --> 52:15.208
-Keep an eye on this boy.

52:15.250 --> 52:17.916
When he decides to go
to the forest,

52:17.958 --> 52:20.916
we need to keep him company
by all means.

52:30.250 --> 52:32.625
But on the other hand,
as the guardian,

52:32.666 --> 52:36.375
shouldn't I learn as much
about our enemies as I can?

52:36.416 --> 52:40.333
If Lucas isn't evil, maybe other
humans aren't evil either.

52:41.916 --> 52:45.083
Oh, stop croaking about
the law of the forest!

52:45.125 --> 52:47.291
Maybe it's time
for things to change

52:47.333 --> 52:51.208
so that the forest-dwellers
and humans could live in peace.

52:51.250 --> 52:52.333
Oh!

53:09.250 --> 53:11.750
Uhh, no! I can't show up
looking like this.

53:11.791 --> 53:13.875
-Hm!

53:15.750 --> 53:17.166
Huh?

53:17.208 --> 53:20.208
Gotta find something
a human would wear.

53:58.916 --> 54:01.791
Hey, boy. I'm making a gift.

54:04.250 --> 54:07.500
Yes, Dot,
Mavka is going to love me.

54:07.541 --> 54:09.875
Uh, it! It.

54:15.416 --> 54:18.083
And...done.

54:25.208 --> 54:27.375
-Hey, where are the pies?!

54:28.750 --> 54:30.875
Pie-demolisher!

54:30.916 --> 54:32.791
-It's fine.

54:32.833 --> 54:34.708
I'm not perfect either.

54:34.750 --> 54:37.291
For instance, I'm about to
break my promise to Hush

54:37.333 --> 54:38.916
and the forest law

54:38.958 --> 54:41.250
in order to keep
my promise to Mavka.

54:47.416 --> 54:49.583
Mavka, are you here?

54:49.625 --> 54:52.791
Your hair! How are you here?

54:52.833 --> 54:54.833
Aren't you happy to see me?

54:54.875 --> 54:57.000
No. I mean, yes!

54:57.041 --> 54:59.458
Heart-burstingly happy,

54:59.500 --> 55:01.416
which is a thing I probably
shouldn't say out loud.

55:03.333 --> 55:06.541
Oh, is this your nest?

55:06.583 --> 55:10.875
I prefer
to think of it as a cave.

55:12.125 --> 55:14.791
Is this for making music too?

55:16.666 --> 55:18.500
-Uh, no.

55:18.541 --> 55:23.000
Those are regular instruments,
not musical instruments.

55:23.041 --> 55:24.708
I've come to return your flute.

55:24.750 --> 55:27.000
It was broken, but I...

55:27.041 --> 55:29.000
Here.

55:32.583 --> 55:33.958
Thank you.

55:41.750 --> 55:46.458
Now you can go to the stone
forest and follow your dream.

55:46.500 --> 55:49.750
Just play for me one last time
and then I'll leave.

55:49.791 --> 55:52.250
No. No, don't leave!

55:52.291 --> 55:54.083
Uh, I have an idea.

55:54.125 --> 55:56.333
I'll play even better music
for you.

55:56.375 --> 55:59.166
There's a festival in town and
my band is playing. Let's go!

56:02.000 --> 56:05.166
-Uh...
- Don't be afraid.

56:05.208 --> 56:07.000
It'll be good
for guardian of the forest

56:07.041 --> 56:08.708
to know more about us humans,
right?

56:08.750 --> 56:10.583
Uh...

56:12.083 --> 56:14.583
-You're gonna love it.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.708
Huh?

56:41.250 --> 56:44.500
Mavka, let's find you
an outfit that says,

56:44.541 --> 56:47.041
"I am a non-alarming
local human."

56:47.083 --> 56:48.750
What's wrong with this one?

56:48.791 --> 56:51.125
Well, it kind of screams,

56:51.166 --> 56:53.833
"Howdy, I'm a barely disguised
forest demon

56:53.875 --> 56:55.416
"from behind the Dark Mountain."

56:57.083 --> 56:58.500
Oh!

57:27.083 --> 57:28.541
Oh.

57:31.708 --> 57:33.083
-Oh!

57:34.166 --> 57:36.916
-Hm?

57:47.291 --> 57:49.916
-And this is my uncle Leo.
-Oh!

57:49.958 --> 57:52.125
He's the one you saved
with your gift.

58:04.583 --> 58:06.333
Hm?

58:07.833 --> 58:09.750
What have you done?

58:11.458 --> 58:14.333
Oh! Those are
my friends playing.

59:00.875 --> 59:05.208
This music, the dancing -
how delightful!

59:05.250 --> 59:08.000
But you still play better
than anybody else.

59:08.041 --> 59:10.083
He was born that way!

59:10.125 --> 59:13.041
So, Lucas,
Uncle Leo is recovered.

59:13.083 --> 59:14.833
He looks better than you now.

59:14.875 --> 59:17.833
Isn't it time to show
your talent to the big city?

59:17.875 --> 59:20.541
Um, well...

59:20.583 --> 59:24.333
Or has the music shown you
a different way?

59:24.375 --> 59:27.333
A very beautiful way.

59:27.375 --> 59:30.208
Well, your call, Romeo.

59:30.250 --> 59:32.416
We're always happy
to have you with us.

59:32.458 --> 59:34.541
Pack up. We gotta go.

59:34.583 --> 59:37.875
Oh, that's right, it's late.
I must go too.

59:37.916 --> 59:41.666
Thank you for the wonderful time
and for the gift.

59:41.708 --> 59:45.500
Wait! I haven't fulfilled
my promise yet.

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:10.208
-Look! A demon from the forest!

01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:15.375
-She's glowing!
-Green hair!

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:18.666
An evil spirit from behind
the Dark Mountain!

01:00:18.708 --> 01:00:20.166
What shall we do?

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:22.833
She's come to kill
our lovey ones

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:25.625
and destroy our food crops!

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:28.250
No! It's not true!

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.708
This lad is trying
to protect the demon.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.291
She has bewitched him.

01:00:32.333 --> 01:00:34.500
-She'll put a curse on us.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:36.000
Get her!

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:38.750
No! She won't hurt anyone.

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:49.166
-Lucas!

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:50.625
No!

01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:52.333
- Hm...
-Argh!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.583
Let me go! Lucas!

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.833
What do we do?

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.458
-Burn her, right?
-No, they drown witches!

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.083
Let's do both!

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:18.541
My fellow villagers,
I was wrong.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:22.750
The evil spirits of the forest
are very real.

01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:27.583
And now I see that it was her
kind that burned up my father,

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:30.666
the goodly sawmill owner.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:32.541
How dare she!

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:33.875
But fear not!

01:01:33.916 --> 01:01:36.208
My eyes are open now

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.791
and I will find out what
the demons have in store for us,

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:41.333
be it plague...

01:01:41.375 --> 01:01:42.791
-..drought...

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:47.208
-..famine, fire or flood!

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.208
And where the Source of Life is.

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.458
-Oh!

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.458
-What is this?!

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.291
-What's happening?
-Black magic!

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:10.000
-Argh!

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:18.750
Don't let her get away!

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.625
-Lesh!

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:47.958
Where'd he go?
Is he gone?

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.375
All is lost!

01:02:51.416 --> 01:02:56.166
My strong silks, my robust
ribbons, my manly laces,

01:02:56.208 --> 01:02:59.583
the Soul of Frol - gone!

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.625
Oh!

01:03:06.666 --> 01:03:11.833
It isn't over yet,
my whiny little pet.

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:18.458
My poor, dear,
terrified fellow villagers,

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.333
we underestimated
the demon's power

01:03:21.375 --> 01:03:24.041
and the results were tragic.

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.541
But this is not the end.

01:03:28.583 --> 01:03:30.166
They'll soon be back!

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.333
-Oh, no! What do we do?
-Oh, this is terrible!

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:37.083
There's only one way
to stop this evil.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.833
Strike first!

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.791
Lesh,
how did you find me?

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:52.416
Hush told me everything.

01:03:52.458 --> 01:03:55.416
I don't understand what's
happening. Those humans...

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.291
Calm down now.

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.708
Those humans obviously conspired

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:03.458
to lure you into a trap.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:08.708
I love how no matter where you
look, you see goodness, Mavka,

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:13.625
but you have made
the same mistake I made once

01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:16.500
in trusting a human.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:18.375
Lucas would never do that.

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.791
I'm sure
he can explain everything.

01:04:28.875 --> 01:04:30.333
-Mavka!?

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:45.041
Now, Lucas,

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:47.708
be a good boy of limited
intellect and integrity

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:51.458
and mark the Source of Life
on this crudely drawn map.

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.875
Never gonna happen, lady.

01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:02.125
Somebody found a backbone!

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:05.541
Let's see if we can't just
melt it like meringue.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:07.625
Ooh, I'm peckish.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.166
Oh, no!

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.583
Don't touch her!

01:05:22.625 --> 01:05:24.458
The source...

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.541
-..or she dies.

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:37.750
Now let Mavka go!

01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:40.958
Sure thing, ding-a-ling.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.875
Oh, Lucas!
Smooch, smooch, swoon!

01:05:44.916 --> 01:05:47.833
Oh, you saved me! You saved me!

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:51.750
You're so, so dumb.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:55.583
No! Kylina, you won't
get away with this!

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:58.375
-Ah! Ah!

01:05:58.416 --> 01:06:02.416
Really?
Guess I'll just stop, then.

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:05.041
Have a nice swim, sweetie!

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:19.125
So much water has flowed past
since that fateful day,

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:23.416
the time has come for me
to tell the full truth.

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:28.458
The battle
all those winters ago -

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.791
I've never told anyone
the reason why it happened.

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:39.333
The sawmill owner
came to me in tears.

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:43.250
He was begging me to save
his newborn daughter...

01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.958
..and I believed in goodness
in him.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:52.083
I gave this human

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:55.708
a drop from
the Source of Life itself.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:59.000
Soon, he returned with...

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.166
..well, with an army of humans.

01:07:02.208 --> 01:07:06.208
They wanted the Source of Life
for themselves.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:12.416
So, I called for the Supreme
Spirit of the Underworld,

01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:17.166
the One Who Sits in the Rock,
to give me the Spark of Rage.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:23.166
And, may all those I love
forgive me,

01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.708
he did.

01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:32.291
Everything good in me
was replaced by sheer rage.

01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:36.958
I burned and the world burned.

01:07:43.791 --> 01:07:46.791
Humans and the forest alike.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:52.666
Fire and hatred without end.

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.625
Have you seen Lucas?

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:09.208
Have you seen my boy, Lucas?

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:10.541
Oh!

01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:14.041
Your boy's been taken by
the evil forest demons.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:17.458
-Huh?
-Stings, right?

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.083
But you can still save him
if you join us.

01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:25.333
Take the weapon, old man.
I'm on a schedule here!

01:08:25.375 --> 01:08:29.291
You stay here and make sure
nobody finds the boy...

01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:32.833
..unless you were just dying
to be in the battle?

01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:38.875
This is for our home!

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:40.833
And my youthful skin.

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:44.208
Now let's go
eradicate those demons

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:47.000
for the good of
all we hold dear!

01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:51.083
-Yes!
-Yes! Death to the demons!

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.916
Start the forest killer!

01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:28.208
Humans are preparing
to attack the forest.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.708
Uh!

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:37.333
Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Hey!

01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:56.208
Dot? Dot, is that you?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.541
Good boy!

01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:02.250
Run! Find someone to help me!
Hurry!

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:15.833
So, that's it. War is here.

01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:19.916
The sawmill owner's daughter...

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.916
I know what to do!

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:25.166
What? Decorate their axes
with flowers?

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:28.333
I know what we all need to do -
fight!

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:30.625
No! There's another way!

01:10:30.666 --> 01:10:35.083
I am the guardian
and this is my call. Wait here.

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.666
-Don't look at me.

01:10:39.708 --> 01:10:42.583
She is the guardian.

01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:17.500
What's going on?

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.666
Whoa!

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.041
Please stop!

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:38.333
Hm.

01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:43.041
I might've frightened
the people at the fair,

01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.958
but the forest means no harm
to humans.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.708
We can live in peace
and even help each other.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.041
"Help each other"?

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:55.250
A long time ago,
the forest gave a drop

01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.750
from the Source of Life
to the owner of the sawmill

01:11:57.791 --> 01:12:00.583
so he could heal
his sick newborn daughter.

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:03.125
The forest saved you!

01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:06.416
What? Nobody ever told me!

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:09.208
It is the truth.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.083
The truth?

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:18.250
The truth is the sawmill owner
never had a daughter,

01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:22.291
but he had a beautiful wife that
came up with a tragic story

01:12:22.333 --> 01:12:25.125
about a little sick daughter.

01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.916
My husband was obedient
but weak.

01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.458
He only got me
the one lousy drop

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.958
that kept me young and fit
for all these years.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.125
But how does this
make us enemies?

01:12:36.166 --> 01:12:39.333
Oh, you'll never
understand this. Look at you!

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:43.958
You're Nature's queen,
glowing and gorgeous forever!

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.041
You don't know nothing about
crow's-feet, turkey neck,

01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.875
back fat.

01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:52.583
You'll never get old
and saggy and shrivelled.

01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:54.666
But I can give you
one more drop.

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:57.708
That is so nice of you,

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:03.333
but, see, if I get hold of
the entire Source of Life,

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:07.250
I will not only be young
and beautiful forever,

01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.083
but it'll also make me

01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:13.208
the richest,
most powerful woman ever.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:16.166
But without the Source of Life,
the forest will die.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:18.375
It's gonna die
one way or the other, honey,

01:13:18.416 --> 01:13:20.666
so why not just
get out of my way?

01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:22.541
Hm.

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:29.833
Not all humans are
as cruel and selfish as you are!

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:35.458
Oh, you're thinking about
that lad of yours? Lucas?

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
Huh?

01:13:42.666 --> 01:13:44.583
Do you have any idea
where he is?

01:13:46.958 --> 01:13:49.083
I...

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.875
I'll tell you another truth,
sister.

01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:55.666
I paid Lucas very well
so he would find the source

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.833
and lure you into the village.

01:13:57.875 --> 01:14:02.333
-Huh?
-He took his money and left.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.708
To the city?

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.208
Exactly.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.625
Oh.

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:19.833
And one more thing.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:23.625
Lucas told me it was
almost too easy to fool you

01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:27.041
because you're just so nice.

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:28.833
Oh.

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:33.291
Now get out of my way

01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:36.291
and take your
freaky woodland zoo with you!

01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:49.375
Mavka! I knew we couldn't
trust that Shmucas!

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:52.333
I got it so wrong, Hush.

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:55.750
Humans really are all evil.
Lucas is...

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:58.041
Huh! Huh!

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.375
Who are you, friend?

01:16:06.166 --> 01:16:08.958
You're saying
Shmucas didn't betray us?!

01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:11.625
-Do you believe him?

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.416
Then I have an idea.

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:22.166
Mm! Frol Style!
Madam is going to love it!

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:27.250
Huh?

01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.208
Well? Where's our hero?

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.666
Hm! Hm!

01:16:39.708 --> 01:16:43.041
Go get Shmucas
and I'll deal with this one.

01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:45.083
-Huh?

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.375
Hm!

01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.208
Argh!

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:53.375
I will slice you into
robust little ribbons!

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:03.666
Dot?

01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:20.833
Get back here,
you rotten cabbage!

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.875
Oh-ho-ho! You have
awakened the beast now!

01:17:27.916 --> 01:17:30.416
Knock, knock! Anybody home?

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:37.791
Ooh!

01:18:11.416 --> 01:18:14.416
-Hm.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:19:00.500
Am I glad to see you!

01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:04.666
Ooh!

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.666
Oh-oh-oh!

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:16.000
Huh? Oh!

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.125
Hm.

01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:07.083
So, that's where you're hiding,
you rotten old stump!

01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:15.958
This is all my fault.

01:20:17.416 --> 01:20:19.750
I have to stop this.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.166
Supreme Spirit,

01:20:27.208 --> 01:20:29.458
the One Who Sits in the Rock,

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.375
I call on you!

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:36.083
No! Mavka, don't!

01:20:46.083 --> 01:20:48.375
You have called me, Guardian.

01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:56.166
I beg you, give me the strength
to answer my calling.

01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:59.416
I need the Spark of Rage
to protect the forest.

01:20:59.458 --> 01:21:03.166
The Spark of Rage has its price.

01:21:03.208 --> 01:21:06.041
The price paid
by the previous guardian

01:21:06.083 --> 01:21:09.333
was his enormous strength.

01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:13.333
The rage burned him out
from the inside.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:15.625
And you,

01:21:15.666 --> 01:21:19.333
the Spark will cost you
your life.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:24.250
You shall enter the Nothingness
for eternity.

01:21:24.291 --> 01:21:28.750
I agree, for this
treacherous feeling here,

01:21:28.791 --> 01:21:31.833
now it brings only pain.

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:35.166
As you wish, Guardian.

01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:42.333
Ondina was right.

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:45.000
I was too nice.

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:07.333
Whoa!

01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.750
I forgot to mention...

01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:19.791
I've got you now, weed-face!

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:22.333
..I'm allergic to chainsaws!

01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.500
Hush, you alright?

01:22:31.541 --> 01:22:33.416
Oh, Shmucas!

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:37.375
I'm fine. Got some yellow spots,
but, overall, fine.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:39.333
-Huh?

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:49.041
This village has the worst aura!

01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:56.000
Hush, please,
I need to find Mavka!

01:22:56.041 --> 01:22:58.875
What the hometown hurricane
is that?!

01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:02.375
It seems that IS Mavka.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.416
Oh!

01:23:32.791 --> 01:23:34.541
-Whoa!

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.791
Mavka!

01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:47.791
It's me, Lucas! I'm here!

01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:52.000
Argh, I've got to get closer!

01:23:52.041 --> 01:23:55.125
I might be able to help
with that.

01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.875
Thank you, dear cousin.

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:06.458
Ha! They'll call me Hush,
who first befriended humans.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.958
Uh...uh... Whoa!

01:24:12.708 --> 01:24:15.166
-Whoa!

01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:17.791
Mavka! It's me!

01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:20.291
Please! You have to stop!

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.500
Aah!

01:24:25.041 --> 01:24:27.916
Whoa! Aah! Oh!

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:32.791
-Oh!

01:24:34.458 --> 01:24:37.250
Where are you going?
You're gonna die!

01:24:37.291 --> 01:24:41.000
I don't care.
I have to save her.

01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:43.291
There's nothing you can do.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:46.791
She can no longer understand
your words. Do you copy?

01:24:46.833 --> 01:24:48.208
What did you say?

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:52.500
I said she can't hear
your words! Run!

01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:55.416
Hush, you are a genius!

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:59.958
Finally I can scratch
hearing that off my bucket list!

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.791
She can't hear my words,
but what if...

01:25:34.333 --> 01:25:38.916
I got it! I got it!
They need our help.

01:25:53.458 --> 01:25:56.541
We should all do this together!

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Mavka, it's me.

01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:55.250
Hear me, please!

01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:09.625
Come back to me. Please!

01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:37.666
Is this what Nothingness
feels like?

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:41.541
This is
the place of no phantom dreams,

01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:45.416
where no songs are carried
by the wind.

01:27:45.458 --> 01:27:49.458
The fire of hate and rage
does not burn here.

01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:52.541
Rage doesn't burn
in my heart anymore.

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:58.666
I heard his voice and now
I know he never betrayed me.

01:27:58.708 --> 01:28:02.333
You have chosen
to spare the lives of the humans

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:04.875
who have caused you
so much pain.

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:08.583
But they also
gave me something

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:11.000
I've never felt before.

01:28:14.166 --> 01:28:16.500
We have made the right choice

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:19.625
making you the new guardian.

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:22.916
You have bridged the gap
between the humans

01:28:22.958 --> 01:28:25.583
and the forest-dwellers,

01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:29.500
but now you have to pay
the promised price

01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:34.083
and remain in
the Nothingness forever.

01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:36.125
For eternity.

01:28:44.166 --> 01:28:45.666
No.

01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:49.083
I'm alive
and I will live on forever

01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:53.375
because now my heart is full of
something that will never die.

01:29:12.583 --> 01:29:16.625
Through the darkness,
I heard your music.

01:29:16.666 --> 01:29:20.583
It filled me here.

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:24.375
Your music is the real magic.

01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:26.541
No.

01:29:26.583 --> 01:29:30.708
The only magic humans have
is love.
