02:18.239 --> 02:19.873
How do you do that?

02:21.409 --> 02:24.612
Wake up at the exact
same second every morning.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.748
An act of will.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.520
Anything wrong?

02:35.456 --> 02:38.859
This man showed up while I
was at the pool last night.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.262
It was very weird.

02:41.329 --> 02:46.700
He told me to tell you
to call him.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.303
He said his name was...

02:49.370 --> 02:51.772
Karl Stoltz.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.741
It doesn't ring a bell.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.344
Another...

02:57.245 --> 02:59.247
degenerate

02:59.280 --> 03:02.249
who works for
Billy McBride, of course.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.251
Sent to intimidate us.

03:04.252 --> 03:07.120
Let's not talk about Billy.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.523
Tell me about me.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.663
I mean, I...

03:18.299 --> 03:20.434
I'm just at the beginning
of knowing you,

03:20.501 --> 03:21.969
if I even know you at all.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.705
You know me.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.941
Tell me.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.994
You're...

03:50.298 --> 03:51.932
so brilliant.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.306
But very...

04:00.808 --> 04:02.310
damaged.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.550
Touch me while you tell me.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.621
Mm-mm.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.494
Touch my face while you tell me.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.338
You hurt...

04:31.339 --> 04:32.940
so much...

04:35.042 --> 04:37.378
because you're not loved.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.651
One finger.

04:49.156 --> 04:53.461
You built the firm together,
but it was mostly you,

04:53.527 --> 04:56.764
and he got all the love...

04:58.866 --> 05:00.368
while you...

05:01.669 --> 05:04.371
you were the disfigured ghoul

05:04.372 --> 05:07.140
alone in a dark room.

05:07.207 --> 05:11.144
He got the admiration
and affection,

05:11.211 --> 05:15.382
and you got... fear.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.884
More.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.719
And he mocked you.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.756
He still mocks you.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.760
More.

05:26.827 --> 05:27.861
You can sense it,

05:27.928 --> 05:30.464
even as he threatens
people's livelihood

05:30.531 --> 05:31.532
with this case,

05:31.599 --> 05:33.701
that they're rooting for him.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.471
Imagine everything...

05:38.572 --> 05:40.974
everything that they have

05:41.041 --> 05:43.444
you gave them.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.851
And it is so, so wrong.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.887
- Ohh!
- Yeah! Oh, fuck!

05:53.954 --> 05:55.756
- Yeah!
- Oh, God!

05:55.823 --> 05:57.791
Oh! Ohh!

05:57.858 --> 05:59.860
Yeah! Ohh!

05:59.927 --> 06:00.928
Oh, yeah.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.296
Oh, yeah. Oh,

06:03.431 --> 06:05.098
God, it feels so good.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.333
Yeah. Ohh!

06:14.575 --> 06:16.444
You didn't have to go that far.

06:16.477 --> 06:19.112
Yeah. I did.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.553
So now what?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.856
I'll take it from here.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.929
Listen,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.097
I... I'm real sorry

06:37.164 --> 06:39.166
that I had you even
doing this shit.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.902
Oh, hey. I'm a pro.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.719
Two days are scheduled for
this round of depositions.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.321
We intend to use
every second of that time,

07:01.388 --> 07:04.091
and we're not putting up with
any more of your nonsense.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.527
Objection. Argumentative.
We just started this thing.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.971
- Let's get out of here.
- See this?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.897
It's a proposed
Order of Contempt,

07:09.963 --> 07:11.565
to be filed with Judge Keller

07:11.632 --> 07:14.001
should you continue
to be obstructionist.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.007
Mrs. Larson,
if I were being kind,

07:20.073 --> 07:23.310
I could say
that your testimony
has been inconsistent,

07:23.376 --> 07:24.712
but it's far worse than that.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.780
- It's mendacious.
- Mendacious?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.316
I'm sorry. That means
that you're lying.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.551
I'm not lying.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.153
- Of course you are.
- Object. Strike that.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.226
Thank you.

08:13.293 --> 08:16.096
I want to punch that
midget bitch in the face.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.798
I swear to God.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.833
Actually,
she's improved a little.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.171
Have you ever in your life
had a worse deposition?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.574
I don't know.
Probably not.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.908
Maybe. I'm not sure.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.812
Thank you.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.118
I mean, that was... that
was a literal disaster.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.754
My thing is, and I
don't even like kids,

08:40.821 --> 08:42.956
how is it that you can
look at a child

08:43.023 --> 08:45.793
and just make them
feel like shit?

08:52.633 --> 08:53.767
God damn!

08:53.834 --> 08:55.936
What are you doing?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.608
We'll be right there.
Just stay calm.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.910
It's all right. Okay.

09:02.976 --> 09:03.744
Bye.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.178
What? Who was that?

09:05.245 --> 09:08.916
Marva. Somebody broke
in the storage locker.

09:08.982 --> 09:09.717
What?

09:09.783 --> 09:11.284
Yes. We got to go.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.953
Okay. Wait. Wait.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.622
Stop. I want you
to call the cops,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.824
and there's literally
a hospital down the street.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.225
I can move it.
It's not broken.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.426
You have to get
it X-rayed.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.628
Get in the fucking car.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.195
You don't know if it's bro...

09:27.635 --> 09:28.902
God damn it.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.304
Help me with the steering
wheel, will you?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.646
Okay, let go, God damn it.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.918
Oh, shit.

09:48.555 --> 09:49.757
Son of a bitch.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.258
Look, I don't know who did this,

09:51.324 --> 09:52.392
but it wasn't Borns Tech

09:52.459 --> 09:53.770
because they gave us
all this stuff.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.995
Yeah, I know that, Marva.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.164
The model at Ryan's
and the blueprints,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.165
where are they?

09:58.231 --> 09:59.466
They're in my car.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.334
All right, let's go.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.071
Oh, no. Please, Billy, no.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.506
Please? I can't clean
this up by myself!

10:06.573 --> 10:08.608
It's just some fucking
papers, honey.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.981
God damn it.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.416
The forces
of anti-American hatred

10:16.483 --> 10:18.151
that killed my brother...

10:19.419 --> 10:20.688
those enemies are out

10:20.754 --> 10:22.790
to destroy every
single one of us.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.859
It's one of the reasons
I went into law...

10:25.926 --> 10:28.361
so that I could work
with companies

10:28.428 --> 10:30.430
like Borns Tech,

10:30.497 --> 10:33.166
who make it their mission

10:33.233 --> 10:37.137
to fight evil
in the Middle East.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.506
The evidence will show

10:39.572 --> 10:43.410
that this case is about evil.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.778
Ha!

10:44.845 --> 10:46.446
How'd you get this?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.348
Friends in the IT department.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.458
Listen...
Listen to this part.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.852
In 2004,

10:51.919 --> 10:55.288
my brother Adam was killed

10:55.355 --> 10:58.258
fighting the forces of evil
in Mosul.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.361
I know the Larsons' hurt.

11:01.428 --> 11:07.200
I know what it is
to... lose someone.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.302
- He was...
- See?

11:09.369 --> 11:10.804
That.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.840
That's why he tapped her:

11:12.906 --> 11:15.475
her dead brother.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.643
Can you believe it?

11:16.744 --> 11:18.746
It's not a bad choice.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.614
The jury's going to love her.

11:21.749 --> 11:25.585
That's my opening in my case.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.520
Think about it.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.756
The hardest thing to do

11:28.822 --> 11:30.858
is to humanize
a corporate client,

11:30.924 --> 11:33.426
and Lucy does that.
Look at her.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.095
He was my entire world.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.001
You're right.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.771
I hate that.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.572
And when he died, I vowed...

11:45.638 --> 11:47.040
That's all you get from this?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.276
- ...to make it my mission...
- What?

11:49.342 --> 11:50.443
What?
What did I miss?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.946
...Borns Tech who keep
our loved ones safe.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.015
That it's cruel for Donald

11:55.082 --> 11:56.950
to be putting a young
girl through this,

11:57.017 --> 12:00.020
to be milking her pain
for the good of a case.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.454
When she's done with it,

12:01.521 --> 12:02.598
you think he's going to care?

12:02.622 --> 12:03.622
Of course not.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.192
For all we know,

12:05.258 --> 12:07.460
this is exactly
why he hired her,

12:07.527 --> 12:11.799
just in case Borns Tech
got caught on their shit.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.234
He's so fucking cold.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.347
A little hot to be doing
that today, isn't it, judge?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.627
Did you ever build a float
out of these things

12:31.651 --> 12:34.354
and put them in the Rose Parade?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.456
What are you doing here?

12:36.523 --> 12:37.825
I would have called,

12:37.858 --> 12:39.135
but your clerk wouldn't
give me the number...

12:39.159 --> 12:40.759
- Are you drunk?
- ...so I came over. No.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.505
I hope so for your sake
that you are drunk.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.098
I'm not drinking, no.
This is really important.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.867
If you'll just let me
come inside with you,

12:46.934 --> 12:48.635
I'll explain it to you.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.237
Inside.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.873
- Are you coming?
- Inside, Mr. McBride.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.449
You got two minutes.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.017
All right.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.287
We dug this up
at Ryan Larson's house.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.989
It's a model and some blueprints

13:09.056 --> 13:11.258
for a weapons system
he was working on
for Borns Tech.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.961
Are you trying to get
held in contempt again?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.462
You can get disbarred

13:15.528 --> 13:17.730
for even discussing this
with me outside the court,

13:17.865 --> 13:18.932
let alone argue it.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.467
I'm not arguing anything.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.937
You asked me a question.
I'm just answering it.

13:24.004 --> 13:25.772
See this? I got that

13:25.873 --> 13:27.283
when a guy tried
to run me down today.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.885
That's the same guy
who's been following me

13:28.909 --> 13:30.243
ever since I took the case.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.545
You're insane.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.612
And I'm not...

13:33.646 --> 13:34.882
It gets better.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.516
Somebody broke
in my storage locker.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.085
Dumped out all the discovery,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.987
looking for this fucking
thing, I'm guessing.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.122
Then you report it
to the police.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
You don't bring it to me.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.158
I'd love to report it
to the police,

13:45.225 --> 13:46.535
but you see,
the police pulled me over

13:46.559 --> 13:48.728
on a bullshit DUI,
beat the hell out of me,

13:48.795 --> 13:49.796
and tased my daughter.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.531
Then my client gets killed

13:51.598 --> 13:52.900
outside your court.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.334
They still don't have a suspect.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.170
Two of my witnesses get
popped on a drug charge,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.372
Neither one has a record
for drug dealing.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.909
Now, you think all
that's a coincidence?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.444
That's a laundry
list of shit, judge.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.582
What are you looking for
from me, Mr. McBride?

14:09.649 --> 14:10.717
Huh?

14:10.783 --> 14:11.919
My help?

14:11.985 --> 14:13.120
The rules say that the court

14:13.186 --> 14:14.754
has to retain
evidence pre-trial

14:14.821 --> 14:16.389
if the circumstances warrant it.

14:16.456 --> 14:19.126
As long as I tell the other
side what I'm doing,

14:19.192 --> 14:21.328
you have to take this evidence.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.632
We scoured our files,

14:25.698 --> 14:26.967
and we didn't find anything

14:27.034 --> 14:29.269
about what McBride
dug up in Larson's yard.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.939
Is this a Borns Tech
weapon or not?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.775
It's a fair question,
Wendell. Is it?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.777
Is this thing
one of ours or not?

14:37.844 --> 14:40.247
I deny knowing
anything about this.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.184
The firm knows nothing.

14:44.251 --> 14:47.054
Are you all crazy?
We're breaking the law here.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.323
You can pretend we have
plausible deniability,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.960
- but we don't.
- That's exactly what we have.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.228
This case is only about

14:55.295 --> 14:58.365
what caused a boat to blow up
in the middle of the night,

14:58.431 --> 15:02.335
and for that the burden is
completely on the plaintiff.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.770
If you were general counsel,

15:03.836 --> 15:05.572
what would you do
with this information?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.740
Why are you asking me?

15:07.807 --> 15:09.876
First because
you're outside counsel.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.344
We pay for your advice.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.314
Secondly, your opinion
seems to fucking matter...

15:14.381 --> 15:16.249
not to me,
but evidently to them.

15:16.316 --> 15:20.053
I would maintain the client's
privilege of confidentiality.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.988
So you'd stay quiet as a mouse.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.991
I'm not a fucking mouse.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.094
And should McBride have evidence

15:27.160 --> 15:29.996
which shows
we were working up
a band cluster bomb,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.031
you'd still stay quiet?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.000
There's no evidence.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.534
It's just allegations.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.069
Allegations?

15:37.404 --> 15:40.373
Just between us lawyers,
we already know

15:40.440 --> 15:43.043
Borns Tech did bad shit
and covered it up.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.246
The law imposes a duty
on me to report this.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.681
Yeah, and just
between us lawyers,

15:48.748 --> 15:50.050
should somebody report it

15:50.117 --> 15:51.718
outside this firm or Borns Tech,

15:51.784 --> 15:54.254
violating the attorney-
client privilege,

15:54.321 --> 15:57.357
somebody would lose
his law license.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.793
And for staying quiet,
somebody could go to prison.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.362
All right, I've sat here

16:02.429 --> 16:03.896
and listened to this bullshit

16:04.031 --> 16:05.311
just about long...

16:05.365 --> 16:07.934
You've got much to think
about and consider.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.570
Let's all take a break.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.039
Shall we?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.083
Okay, so, assuming
we get to trial,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.752
Ned is our only expert witness.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.919
So what else?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.355
What else?

16:28.421 --> 16:31.424
It's better to have one
than none, isn't it?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.560
It's not how many
witnesses you have,

16:33.626 --> 16:35.662
it's what they have
to say that counts.

16:35.728 --> 16:38.398
Then we're really fucked
because Ned is Ned,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.133
and the jury's
already going to hate him

16:40.200 --> 16:41.301
for the revenge porn.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.103
We may have another witness.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.604
- Who?
- Right?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.106
We don't have him yet.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.974
We're going to have him.

16:48.075 --> 16:50.543
I'll see to it if you don't.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.417
Are you drunk?

16:57.484 --> 17:00.520
That's none of your
goddamn business.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.723
You... You see this, right?

17:06.159 --> 17:07.794
Everyone's here because of you,

17:07.859 --> 17:10.097
so it is my goddamn business.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.432
When I asked you point blank

17:12.499 --> 17:13.942
if I should be scared
to do this case,

17:13.965 --> 17:15.167
you said no.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.569
Well, I'll let
you girls sit here

17:17.637 --> 17:20.573
and dwell on your
fucking problems.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.297
♫ Ain't it lonesome ♫

17:44.364 --> 17:46.599
♫ Get along ♫

17:46.666 --> 17:50.770
♫ Babe, I'm alone,
home alone ♫

17:58.178 --> 18:01.481
♫ Ain't it lonesome ♫

18:01.548 --> 18:03.316

18:05.017 --> 18:07.153

18:16.296 --> 18:19.399
♫ Well, I ain't got nobody ♫

18:19.466 --> 18:24.404
♫ Nobody to keep me company ♫

18:36.048 --> 18:41.454
♫ Hey, I'm gonna
give you a warning ♫

18:44.957 --> 18:46.117
Right here, right here!

18:46.193 --> 18:47.394
♫ I'm goin' back down ♫

18:47.460 --> 18:49.629
♫ That lonesome road ♫

18:56.236 --> 18:59.306
♫ Well, I ain't got nobody ♫

18:59.372 --> 19:03.410
♫ Nobody to keep me company ♫

19:11.017 --> 19:12.419
Hi. You've reached Rachel.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.354
I'm not home right now,
but leave a message,

19:14.421 --> 19:15.955
and I'll get back
to you. Thanks.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.457
Have a great day.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.439
♫ Well, I ain't got nobody ♫

19:32.505 --> 19:36.776
♫ Nobody to keep me company ♫

19:57.430 --> 20:02.001
♫ Hey, hey, babe ♫

20:02.068 --> 20:05.171
♫ Mm-hmm, baby ♫

20:05.238 --> 20:07.507
♫ Mm-hmm, babe ♫

20:14.414 --> 20:16.483
Hey, honey, what are you
doing out here?

20:16.549 --> 20:17.917
Why didn't you knock?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.952
I did, and I texted you.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.454
You ready?

20:21.521 --> 20:23.256
Yeah.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.463
We're supposed to
practice driving today.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.898
Right.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.099
Mom won't do it,

20:33.165 --> 20:34.677
and she makes me
too nervous anyway, so...

20:34.701 --> 20:36.436
Look, there's
something I got to do,

20:36.503 --> 20:37.604
and I can't get out of it.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.339
Are you the one Mom's dating?

20:39.406 --> 20:40.973
Where the hell
did that come from?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.742
Of course not.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.544
She has a restraining
order against me.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.813
- How could I be dating her?
- Yeah, now,

20:46.879 --> 20:49.316
because you probably screwed
things up with her again.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.395
You two hooking up
for the sex? Is that it?

20:52.419 --> 20:54.354
I said it's not me.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.222
And that's creepy.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.690
You're my kid.
Come on.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.891
Don't do that.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.130
So it really wasn't you?

21:04.196 --> 21:06.333
No, it wasn't me.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.971
I was kind of hoping it was.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.348
Be nicer to Mom.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.952
Well, ahem,

21:26.018 --> 21:28.788
see, I can't get within
200 yards of her,

21:28.855 --> 21:30.022
so...

21:30.089 --> 21:31.223
You could start

21:31.358 --> 21:32.959
by dropping this case
against her firm.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.062
It's making her crazy.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.363
The case is not about me.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.931
The case is about a client...

21:38.998 --> 21:40.909
- You're so full of it.
- ...and a guy who got killed.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.369
It's all about you.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.212
If Donald Cooperman wasn't
on the other side of this,

21:44.236 --> 21:45.672
you wouldn't give a shit.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.609
And you're drinking
too much again.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.579
I can smell you.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.817
I'm not stupid, Dad.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.488
You're sure not.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.561
So you won't drop it?

22:10.196 --> 22:11.431
Not even for me?

22:11.498 --> 22:14.901
No, I can't, honey.
I'm sorry.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.904
Well, I don't forgive you.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.925
Mmm.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.862
Should we be worried,
do you think?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.798
Leonard Letts
won't go to the FBI.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.435
He's too scared.
He's got too much at stake.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.970
I'd go if I were him.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.672
Why don't you go, then?

22:52.739 --> 22:54.240
For that matter, why don't I go?

22:54.306 --> 22:56.643
I mean, we know
the corporation is guilty

22:56.709 --> 22:58.244
of really bad stuff.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.612
The only question is how much,

22:59.679 --> 23:00.947
and we have a legal duty

23:01.013 --> 23:02.449
to report
the corporation's crimes.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.250
No. I'm not sure
that we do.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.453
It's a really gray area.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.287
The court says a lawyer needs

23:08.354 --> 23:10.723
to maintain client
confidentiality,

23:10.790 --> 23:13.593
especially when they
confess to crimes.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.462
Right.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.996
Well, some poor schmuck

23:17.063 --> 23:18.330
is going to get convicted

23:18.465 --> 23:20.833
of not reporting
that corporation's crimes.

23:20.900 --> 23:24.471
And then the Supreme Court
will reverse the decision

23:24.504 --> 23:28.207
and strike down the law
in maybe ten years.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.077
Do you want to be that
test case? Because I don't.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.512
And neither does Leonard.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.147
I don't know.
He's fucked, right?

23:35.214 --> 23:36.483
He's just fucked.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.217
We all are.

23:38.284 --> 23:43.322
Which is why we want to get
out while we still can

23:43.389 --> 23:45.024
and start our own thing.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.727
Stop it. Really, you're
going to go there again?

23:47.794 --> 23:51.163
You got to stop. You're
like a dog with a bone.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.568
Oh, shit.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.038
Jesus.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.640
What are you doing home?

24:00.707 --> 24:03.510
Uh, I got a text to come home.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.513
Ohh.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.149
Did you text her?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.284
She's your daughter.

24:12.351 --> 24:14.253
She should know who you love.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.523
You need to go now.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.065
Denise?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.535
Baby?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.903
This place I've
been to many times.

24:30.970 --> 24:34.440
And, uh, it's just,
uh... right here.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.208
- Up the stairs?
- She's... Yep.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.848
Yeah, but please
don't make me do this.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.050
I told you we have to,
or Cooperman will.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.018
He'll get her
to testify as a witness

24:46.085 --> 24:47.820
that you're some kind
of a scum bag.

24:47.887 --> 24:50.723
Which I am. I am.
He's right.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.324
Which apartment is it?

24:52.391 --> 24:53.660
25.

24:55.461 --> 24:56.729
Hey.

24:56.796 --> 25:00.099
Ned. What are you doing here?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.302
I'm Billy.
I'm a friend of Ned's.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.980
- That's Billy.
- He just wanted to come by

25:05.004 --> 25:06.405
and talk to you
for a few minutes.

25:06.472 --> 25:07.573
If you can just...

25:07.574 --> 25:09.041
I guess.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.743
Thank you so much.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.586
Sorry for the intrusion,
Miss, uh...

25:19.619 --> 25:20.887
Millie, by the way.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.488
Absolutely.
I know all about you.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.223
Ned talks about you
all the time.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.925
I'm going to go outside

25:25.992 --> 25:27.459
and give you guys some privacy.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.228
I'll just have
a smoke out there.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.097
Sure. Go ahead.
Okay.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.632
Who is this guy?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.967
I'll explain it to you later.

25:36.936 --> 25:41.073
You showed our tape to people?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.141
I'm so sorry.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.311
That was private, Ned.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.412
I know.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.347
The most private
thing I ever did.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.917
It's just I...
I was hurt,

25:50.983 --> 25:52.327
and... and, you know,
I was angry...

25:52.351 --> 25:53.620
And the only reason I did it

25:53.653 --> 25:55.254
was because you begged me to.

25:56.923 --> 25:59.625
My parents could see that tape.

25:59.626 --> 26:00.693
I am so sorry.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.095
- My nieces.
- I was angry.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.530
The people I work with.

26:04.631 --> 26:05.632
I was hurting.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.133
I broke up with you

26:07.199 --> 26:08.467
because we had no future.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.637
I have to get on with my life.

26:11.638 --> 26:15.174
I want kids, a family.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.275
So do I.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.244
- Do you?
- So do I.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.847
I mean, should you?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.181
With all that mental stuff

26:22.248 --> 26:23.716
you've got going on
in your head?

26:23.783 --> 26:26.118
I... I could
get help for that.

26:26.185 --> 26:30.056
I would if you'd
just give me a chance.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.223
You know? I...

26:32.825 --> 26:34.661
I want a legacy.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.929
I want to have
moments with you like...

26:38.197 --> 26:40.099
Don't you remember when
we went to Solvang?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.935
It was a great trip.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.270
I loved you.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.006
And I still love you.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.680
Sorry.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.683
Sorry to interrupt.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.487
Listen, um,

27:01.553 --> 27:04.791
I guess he told you
I'm an attorney.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.525
We really need your help.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.695
You see, we're going
to have to get Ned

27:08.728 --> 27:10.462
on the stand.

27:10.529 --> 27:11.931
And the other side,

27:11.998 --> 27:14.166
they're going to want
to use this videotape.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.102
- What?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.870
- They can do that?
- Of course they can.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.773
And they will.
We can diffuse that

27:20.840 --> 27:22.308
if you just come along with us.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.377
If you find it in your heart
to forgive Ned...

27:25.444 --> 27:27.013
If you're by his side,

27:27.079 --> 27:31.183
then it really makes
the tape meaningless
to them.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.953
Which would be good
for you and your case.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.022
I don't like being used.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.723
I understand completely.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.725
Of course I want to win my case.

27:39.726 --> 27:42.528
I mean, selfishly, absolutely.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.863
Ned's a good guy.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.732
I know he cares about you.

27:45.798 --> 27:48.935
So above and beyond
any of this stuff,

27:49.001 --> 27:51.871
it would just be great
to see you guys close again

27:51.938 --> 27:53.973
because I can tell
you love each other.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.222
Come on, Blue!
What are you watching?

28:10.289 --> 28:11.858
That was a strike!

28:11.924 --> 28:13.826
Good call, ump.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.165
Your kid looks like
he's throwing darts.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.201
This is baseball.
He needs to use his legs
and follow through.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.770
You ought to
teach him something.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.637
Billy, you want
a Coke or something?

28:25.772 --> 28:27.239
Oh, no, thanks, baby.
I'm all right.

28:30.977 --> 28:35.414
Ohh! Oh, God! I'm so
into this right now.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.785
We did the best we could,
but, as it turns out,

28:38.818 --> 28:40.086
you don't have a good side.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.889
Oh, yeah! Oh, God,
it feels so good.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.590
My wife never sees this.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.558
Really? She might
learn something.

28:46.625 --> 28:47.927
Shut up, you cunt.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.171
Hey, there's no need for that.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.930
You're lucky
she's a nice person.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.374
I was going to just
get the information

28:52.398 --> 28:54.333
and show this
to your wife anyway.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.868
I may still do that.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.705
The Latin guy told me
to fuck with you.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.240
But he's not Latin,
or he's half...

29:01.307 --> 29:02.308
I don't fucking know.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.977
His name is Karl Stoltz.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.445
Who does he work for?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.547
Borns Tech or Cooperman?

29:08.614 --> 29:09.548
I don't even know who that is.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.615
I just know Stoltz.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.351
Who does Stoltz work for?

29:12.418 --> 29:13.619
The DEA, I think.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.554
He's not big on information.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.989
The DEA. All right.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.825
He's an informant for 'em.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.402
Look, that's all
you're getting from me.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.829
We're done.
I got nothing more.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.531
Envelope, please, Brittany.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.399
This is all I got.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.701
A little subpoena for you there.

29:29.836 --> 29:32.638
Yeah? Well, you can
forget about it

29:32.704 --> 29:33.873
because I ain't testifying.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.507
I got a witness here.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.045
You'll be sorry if you
put me on the stand.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.550
What a prick.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.858
♫ Baby, save it ♫

29:52.859 --> 29:55.027
♫ We're wasted ♫

29:58.397 --> 30:01.433
♫ I know we got
to slow it down ♫

30:03.135 --> 30:04.904
I guess I'll see you later.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.240
Okay. Well, can you
do me a favor

30:08.307 --> 30:09.842
and not tell Patty
about the tape

30:09.909 --> 30:11.543
or what I did?

30:11.610 --> 30:12.778
Yeah, okay.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.313
Yeah?

30:14.380 --> 30:16.983
I wish you didn't
have to do it at all.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.118
Yeah.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.455
You seem real busted up over it.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.226
It kind of doesn't make you

30:27.293 --> 30:29.261
any better than a pimp,
though, does it?

30:32.664 --> 30:33.664
I'm done.

30:35.301 --> 30:36.502
Yeah, I know.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.142
I'm gonna miss you.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.612
Why is that?

30:49.548 --> 30:50.883
I love you.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.885
I always have.

31:07.934 --> 31:10.336
If we're going to talk
about the Larson case,

31:10.402 --> 31:13.739
we really should invite
the trial team up.

31:13.805 --> 31:16.175
I don't want either
Callie or Lucy here.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.177
I don't trust them, Donald.

31:18.244 --> 31:21.147
And you trust me?
Oh, that's nice.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.650
Just for the record,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.986
I'm... I'm shocked.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.990
I'm shocked
at Letts' revelations

31:31.057 --> 31:33.259
of illegality at Borns Tech.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.338
So what are you going
to do about it?

31:36.362 --> 31:38.965
In fact, I have
a luncheon appointment

31:39.031 --> 31:41.033
to meet with Letts
and Wendell Corey

31:41.100 --> 31:43.502
to get to the bottom of things
and set things right.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.204
How?

31:46.105 --> 31:49.641
It's not your concern.

31:56.215 --> 32:00.987
In law there is one
great eternal truth:

32:01.053 --> 32:02.854
If anyone goes to prison,

32:02.989 --> 32:05.524
it's the client, not the lawyer.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.593
Cooperman McBride
has represented

32:07.659 --> 32:09.461
far worse than Borns Tech

32:09.528 --> 32:12.031
and survived and maintained
their secrets

32:12.098 --> 32:14.866
and not faced a single
day in jail for it.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.070
Leave it to me,
or leave the firm!

32:18.137 --> 32:19.405
It's up to you.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.607
We've survived
without one McBride!

32:21.673 --> 32:23.575
We can survive without two!

32:30.016 --> 32:31.683
In the meantime...

32:37.923 --> 32:40.059
tell Billy I want to meet him.

32:47.433 --> 32:50.136
At the old place.
He'll know where.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.305
Just the two of you?

32:54.373 --> 32:55.373
Why?

32:59.111 --> 33:00.479
It's time.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.200
Yeah, so you got this creep
of a dirty fucking cop,

33:21.267 --> 33:23.902
and you got a dirty
DEA informant

33:23.969 --> 33:25.404
who I'm as sure as I can be

33:25.471 --> 33:28.140
are working for a dirty
defense contractor.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.478
So I'll give you all
the evidence I've got.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.482
And then you guys take it
from there, you know?

33:36.548 --> 33:39.084
Make an indictment,
root these creeps out,

33:39.085 --> 33:42.088
make your big, splashy
press release and all that

33:42.121 --> 33:43.189
like you do.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.091
You get to fuck the DEA over,

33:45.157 --> 33:47.226
which I know you like to do,

33:47.293 --> 33:51.930
and, uh, FBI's happy,
U.S. Attorney's happy,

33:51.997 --> 33:53.232
and I'm happy.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.801
I heard you were dead.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.969
Cirrhosis.

33:58.104 --> 33:59.238
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:59.305 --> 34:00.482
I'll be damned.
I didn't read that.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.707
- You never heard that?
- Yeah.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.475
Ahem.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.411
What do you want in return?

34:05.477 --> 34:08.114
Everything you got
on Karl Stoltz.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.748
Then if he's dirty,

34:09.815 --> 34:11.117
then maybe help me get a break

34:11.183 --> 34:13.418
on the Marquez brothers'
drug charge.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.722
And anything you share
about Borns Tech.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.659
Borns Tech
is a big player out here.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.960
Lots of big government
contracts.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.196
Major employer, too.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.440
You sound like
a commercial, man.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.904
Are you their spokesman
or something?

34:26.965 --> 34:29.201
You're talking about
a long-term investigation,

34:29.268 --> 34:31.337
grand jury, okay?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.406
Subpoenas, trial hours,
research.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.542
Yeah. That kind of stuff
that you do, right?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.311
Your job. I'm just asking
you to work, that's all.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.980
I'd have to run it by
my deputy chief, at least,

34:42.047 --> 34:43.349
and the chief.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.384
The U.S. Attorney. too.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.553
Yeah, then we got to book
grand jury time,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.621
issue subpoenas,
talk to the D.O.D.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.556
All right, all right.
We'll get back to you.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.995
It's very interesting.

34:58.164 --> 35:00.732
I enjoy this room.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.402
And this club.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.737
They threw a dinner for me here

35:05.804 --> 35:09.208
when I came home in 1972.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.177
I think my dad was here.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.745
He was.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.815
And the President
sent a telegram.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.717
Can you imagine a telegram?

35:18.784 --> 35:22.087
- Pace of progress.
- It's a beautiful room.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.189
Yeah, it is.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.490
As general counsel, Leonard,

35:24.556 --> 35:26.892
you were to be put up
for membership here

35:26.958 --> 35:28.860
or the Jonathan Club

35:28.927 --> 35:30.829
if it had been your preference.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.399
You used the past tense.

35:33.465 --> 35:38.370
The third past tense
conditional, I believe.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.941
You never took Latin, I see.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.876
Ah, that's not surprising.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.514
You're being fired, Leonard.

35:51.217 --> 35:54.286
This is retaliation
for me asking questions

35:54.353 --> 35:56.522
about illegal activity
at the corporation?

35:57.656 --> 36:00.526
You can't fire me
for doing my job

36:00.592 --> 36:03.228
or following the law.
I will go to the FBI,

36:03.229 --> 36:05.231
and I will reveal
what I know to be true.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.299
I will be a whistleblower,

36:07.366 --> 36:10.936
and then I will sue you both
for wrongful termination,

36:11.002 --> 36:12.037
and I'll win, too.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.406
God. y-you know what?

36:14.473 --> 36:17.243
You should file a civil
rights claim. I would.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.578
There's no need
to rankle, Wendell.

36:19.645 --> 36:22.448
There's no need
to fire you, Leonard.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.915
You could stay with us.

36:23.982 --> 36:27.819
You could help us fight back
this McBride threat.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.589
Ship's sinking, Leonard.

36:30.656 --> 36:31.923
Come on.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.294
There's a seat in the life boat.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.531
Just get the fuck
on board. Okay?

36:41.567 --> 36:43.034
It absolutely is right

36:43.101 --> 36:45.271
because if you're following
too closely behind the car,

36:45.304 --> 36:46.438
the guy wants to stop,

36:46.505 --> 36:48.039
and you run up his tail pipe,

36:48.106 --> 36:49.808
you're absolutely to blame.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.844
All right, don't Cr...
Mama, come on.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.180
Come on. Don't cry.
Look, I love you.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.416
Everybody loves you, okay?

36:57.483 --> 37:00.185
But you're a terrible driver.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.286
Okay?

37:03.188 --> 37:04.890
Oh. Hi.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.825
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.

37:08.093 --> 37:11.630
So, uh, Mama, this is
Billy McBride, okay?

37:11.697 --> 37:13.699
This is Irene Papagian,
my ex-mother-in-law.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.434
- Hi.
- These are her boys.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.969
Uh, she had a little bit
of a car accident.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.204
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

37:19.305 --> 37:20.639
It wasn't my fault.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.307
It's absolutely your fault.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.109
You are 100% to blame.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.044
What's this? Just now?
What's...

37:26.111 --> 37:29.315
I know. Can I talk to you
just privately for a second?

37:29.348 --> 37:30.782
I'm sorry.

37:30.849 --> 37:31.883
Thank you.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.656
Hey, listen, I know
it's your family and all,

37:37.723 --> 37:39.157
but I got a lot of shit to do,

37:39.224 --> 37:40.792
and what's wrong
with your office?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.530
Okay. Um...

37:44.596 --> 37:47.366
there's no office.
The office is gone.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.967
What do you mean?

37:49.034 --> 37:50.369
I couldn't keep up the rent,

37:50.436 --> 37:52.504
so I lost the office.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.105
Five minutes max.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.206
- Okay.
- Okay?

37:55.341 --> 37:56.475
All right.

37:56.542 --> 37:57.943
I'm sorry about your office.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.579
I'm sorry.
And it's so embarrassing.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.213
Like, it's so embarrassing.

38:02.348 --> 38:03.382
Don't be embarrassed.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.983
Just, you know, finish up,

38:05.050 --> 38:06.718
and we'll start it later, okay?

38:07.786 --> 38:08.820
Thank you.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.564
Well, I'll be damned.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.601
Is this some kind
of setup or something?

38:22.668 --> 38:25.070
You know, this is
within 200 feet.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.639
You should read the fine print.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.608
The TR is for the house, dummy,

38:29.675 --> 38:31.843
not for me.
Plus, I'm on my own.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.579
Uh, can I get
a Jack Daniels, please?

38:33.645 --> 38:34.713
- You got it.
- Thanks.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.947
What happened to your hand?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.584
Uh, just fucking around.
Sprained my wrist.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.718
Thanks.

38:40.819 --> 38:41.920
So what's up?

38:41.987 --> 38:42.987
Mm.

38:44.390 --> 38:45.657
Cooperman.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.793
He wants to see you tonight.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.395
He said you'd know where.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.165
Yeah, I know where.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.602
So he couldn't call me himself?

38:56.668 --> 38:58.269
Sends you down here

38:58.404 --> 39:00.005
like you're a fucking runner?

39:00.071 --> 39:02.541
Arrogant son of a bitch.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.676
Denise knows about Callie.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.745
What, did you tell her?

39:07.879 --> 39:09.648
Nope. Callie did

39:09.715 --> 39:13.018
in a really,
really unhealthy way.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.487
I can't imagine Callie
telling anybody

39:15.554 --> 39:17.422
in a... in a healthy way.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.957
It's who she is.

39:19.024 --> 39:22.561
You know, I never wanted
to be with a lawyer.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.896
- Thanks.
- But I always end up with one.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.098
Why is that?

39:27.165 --> 39:28.500
I don't know, convenience?

39:28.567 --> 39:30.436
Always one right down the hall.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.514
Then this woman came over.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.816
I have her card
somewhere in the house.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.553
I forget her name.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.221
Do you remember what she said?

39:50.288 --> 39:51.657
I kept asking her
to repeat herself

39:51.723 --> 39:53.124
because I couldn't
fucking believe

39:53.191 --> 39:54.493
what she was telling me.

39:55.861 --> 39:57.696
They're calling in the loan.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.131
Borns cosigned on the house

40:00.198 --> 40:01.399
when Ryan joined them.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.711
And they emptied
the trust account.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.095
That... That's
for Jason's college.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.137
Can they do that?

40:06.204 --> 40:07.739
They can't do that, right?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.675
Actually, yeah, they can.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.410
I can't lose this house.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.447
How am I going to pay
for college?

40:15.514 --> 40:16.674
We just have to win the case.

40:16.715 --> 40:18.617
Well, we're going to try.

40:18.684 --> 40:21.653
You will win, right?

40:21.720 --> 40:22.754
Yeah.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.433
They don't even make
fucking adults anymore.

40:35.501 --> 40:38.069
These little privileged shits.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.806
Everybody's a fucking pussy.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.875
You can't say shit to anybody.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.820
You can't even be a fucking
human being anymore.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.045
You know what I'm saying?

40:48.814 --> 40:51.550
How are you supposed
to be a human being?

40:51.617 --> 40:54.319
30 fucking years
in the Bar, you know?

40:54.520 --> 40:55.754
Not this fucking bar.

40:56.755 --> 40:58.423
30 years of the law.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.391
30 fucking years.

41:00.526 --> 41:03.028
Never turned in
a dishonest day in court.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.530
Not fucking once.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.397
You can check
the trial transcripts

41:06.532 --> 41:08.967
and see for yourself.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.669
Know something else?

41:12.370 --> 41:14.673
I wouldn't change
a fucking thing.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.307
I wouldn't...
I wouldn't change

41:16.374 --> 41:18.276
a fucking thing, Frankie.

41:18.343 --> 41:19.945
Did you know that?

41:20.011 --> 41:21.012
Because I lived.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.114
See, people don't
fucking live anymore.

41:23.181 --> 41:26.051
You can't fucking say anything
that's politically incorrect.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.352
Rumor is you're off the wagon.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.454
...fucking do anything.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.056
No, no, I'm still on the wagon.

41:31.122 --> 41:34.926
I just got a designated driver.

41:34.993 --> 41:35.993
Right.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.430
So what are you doing here?

41:39.565 --> 41:40.632
I don't understand.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.367
I will carry you
through the Larson case,

41:42.433 --> 41:43.669
and then I'm out for reals.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.336
I can't keep doing this.

41:45.403 --> 41:47.372
I never heard that before.

41:47.438 --> 41:48.774
You'll carry me?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.809
How many fucking times
you gonna quit anyway?

41:50.876 --> 41:52.744
It's my own goddamn fault.

41:52.811 --> 41:53.912
I should have never agreed

41:53.979 --> 41:55.881
to take this fucking
thing on anyway.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.886
You know you have a meeting
with Donald Cooperman?

42:02.921 --> 42:04.322
- He called, huh?
- Yeah.

42:04.389 --> 42:05.924
Yeah, he must want something.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.458
Well, you can't go like this.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.227
What, you me to put a tuxedo on?

42:09.294 --> 42:11.072
I'm not gonna crawl
over there to that motherfucker

42:11.096 --> 42:14.666
and, you know, fuckin' run over
to that son of a bitch

42:14.733 --> 42:16.334
like a fucking puppy.
Forget it.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.436
- Hey. Hey.
- What?

42:19.605 --> 42:21.907
You love me?

42:23.341 --> 42:25.711
Oh. Fuck. Uh, look...

42:26.912 --> 42:29.615
honey, of course I love you.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.116
I love everybody.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.287
Can we get this guy
a coffee, please?

42:43.361 --> 42:45.230
Still alive, I see.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.236
What's up, G-man?

42:51.302 --> 42:52.638
Where's your sidekick?

42:52.671 --> 42:55.206
He's at home asleep
sucking his thumb.

42:55.273 --> 42:56.407
He's a pussy.

42:56.474 --> 42:57.976
He seemed like it.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.912
But he's interested
in your case.

43:00.979 --> 43:01.847
No shit.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.715
No shit.
He needs a big case

43:03.782 --> 43:05.550
so he can land a offer
at Kirkland & Ellis

43:05.651 --> 43:07.118
or go in house at Boeing.

43:07.185 --> 43:09.120
He's an ambitious little fuck.

43:09.187 --> 43:10.421
You know how it is.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.157
Yeah, I do.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.325
Still, that's good news.

43:14.392 --> 43:15.694
Sure about that?

43:15.761 --> 43:17.361
If the U.S. Attorney's
office takes over,

43:17.395 --> 43:19.030
who's in charge, you?

43:21.099 --> 43:22.668
So I get nothing?

43:26.738 --> 43:28.273
It's Karl Stoltz.

43:28.339 --> 43:30.008
Don't forget we helped.

43:30.075 --> 43:33.011
We may need you if we
ever indict anybody.

43:33.078 --> 43:36.014
You were right.
He's dirtier than shit.

43:36.081 --> 43:38.083
Before he was a DEA informant,

43:38.149 --> 43:39.150
he worked with us.

43:39.217 --> 43:41.887
We dropped him because
he was making shit up.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.756
When the DEA drops him,
the ATF will pick him up.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.391
Way of the world.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.960
You didn't get this from me.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.198
Why am I getting anything?

43:53.264 --> 43:55.533
Why do you think?

43:55.600 --> 43:57.402
I fucking hate the DEA.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.571
I hate lawyers, too.

44:00.706 --> 44:03.742
That doesn't mean I think
they should get run over.

44:04.743 --> 44:06.712
Yeah, well, I appreciate that.

46:18.476 --> 46:20.378
Okay, Donnie, what do you want?

46:21.712 --> 46:24.315
It's just amazing
after all these years.

46:26.417 --> 46:29.120
I have a deep capacity
for hate myself,

46:29.187 --> 46:33.324
but yours...
yours is impressive.

46:33.391 --> 46:35.093
I don't hate you.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.062
That would take too much effort.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.764
But I'm glad to see
your ego's still intact.

46:39.865 --> 46:42.901
Is that what you tell yourself?

46:42.968 --> 46:45.036
That the opposite of love is...

46:46.237 --> 46:48.339
is not hate.
It's indifference.

46:49.875 --> 46:52.310
I don't believe
that you're indifferent.

46:59.217 --> 47:01.953
Did I ever tell you
that I fucked your wife?

47:02.020 --> 47:05.123
Before you knew her.

47:05.190 --> 47:06.624
And after.

47:06.691 --> 47:08.026
Okay.

47:08.093 --> 47:10.161
That's all you have to say?

47:13.231 --> 47:14.900
I never could rattle you.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.902
And I'm good at rattling people.

47:18.103 --> 47:20.972
But you see right through me,

47:21.039 --> 47:22.974
and I respect that.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.911
What I didn't respect

47:25.977 --> 47:29.047
is your inability
to be a real lawyer.

47:30.916 --> 47:34.152
Yes, you won a few cases.

47:35.653 --> 47:37.088
Showboat.

47:41.792 --> 47:44.195
I built a business.

47:49.300 --> 47:50.568
A culture.

47:50.635 --> 47:52.937
A company.

47:52.938 --> 47:55.506
A law firm.

47:55.573 --> 47:59.377
You were a drunk with talent

47:59.444 --> 48:02.013
who got lucky.

48:03.949 --> 48:06.151
You're playing with fire, Billy.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.524
Borns Tech is not some
goddamn insurance company.

48:13.591 --> 48:17.662
Think about what's
gone down in this case

48:17.728 --> 48:22.000
and ask yourself how much
more of it you can take,

48:22.067 --> 48:24.970
how many more people
are going to get hurt.

48:25.003 --> 48:31.242
Consider... one dead client.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.444
A DUI.

48:33.511 --> 48:36.982
You were almost
run down in the street.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.218
It was terrible.

48:42.853 --> 48:44.022
Don't look at me.

48:44.089 --> 48:45.991
Did I say I did it?

48:48.693 --> 48:51.029
To acknowledge that a crime
has been committed

48:51.096 --> 48:52.263
or will be committed

48:52.330 --> 48:53.564
is not in itself a crime.

48:53.631 --> 48:55.133
You of all people
should know that.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.443
That killer that you
sprung... Bender...

48:56.467 --> 48:58.903
you knew he was
guilty of murder.

48:59.004 --> 49:01.005
You knew he was
likely to murder again,

49:01.006 --> 49:02.740
but you got him off anyway,

49:02.807 --> 49:04.109
and he killed...

49:08.013 --> 49:10.281
that beautiful,
beautiful family.

49:11.349 --> 49:13.618
I don't kill innocent
people, Billy.

49:13.684 --> 49:15.153
You do.

49:16.187 --> 49:18.356
That's why you live in a bottle.

49:18.423 --> 49:21.626
That's why you destroyed
your marriage, your family.

49:23.294 --> 49:26.031
So I take it there's no
offer on the table.

49:26.064 --> 49:29.534
There's always an offer
on the table, Billy boy.

49:33.871 --> 49:35.573
How about nothing?

49:37.442 --> 49:41.479
You withdraw everything,
admit you were wrong...

49:42.880 --> 49:44.882
give up your law license,

49:44.949 --> 49:47.051
give me title to your car,

49:47.052 --> 49:49.254
and you let me
fuck you up the ass.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.127
Don't forget, legally,

49:56.194 --> 50:01.132
you have to convey
the offer to the client.

50:14.079 --> 50:16.147
I gave this to your assistant.

50:17.382 --> 50:19.317
But the fact that you
didn't complain

50:19.384 --> 50:21.586
tells me that you
told her to ignore it.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.954
Can you prove that?

50:24.021 --> 50:26.291
No.

50:26.357 --> 50:27.792
I can't.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.028
Ahem.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.068
But I can prove I served you.

50:38.403 --> 50:40.371
I'm not accepting this service

50:40.438 --> 50:42.507
on behalf of my assistant.

50:42.573 --> 50:44.475
That's okay.
You don't have to.

50:44.542 --> 50:47.412
It's not for her.
It's for you.

50:47.478 --> 50:49.080
Oh.

50:49.147 --> 50:51.649
And I do see right through you.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.119
I've never seen you
this scared before,

50:54.185 --> 50:56.454
you son of a bitch.

55:13.778 --> 55:14.778
You stinker!
