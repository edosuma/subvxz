00:04.196 --> 00:06.064
<i>Previously on Rogue...</i>

00:06.065 --> 00:09.534
The man you want is Marty Stein.

00:09.535 --> 00:13.004
If Marty's behind this, then
that's a fucking problem for me.

00:13.005 --> 00:14.339
And I'm gonna go after him.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.807
I just wanna find Finnegan.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.809
<i>His car was found down by the docks.</i>

00:17.810 --> 00:20.078
<i>Burnt out. Window bashed in.</i>

00:20.079 --> 00:22.347
<i>There's a gun
being held to my head.</i>

00:22.348 --> 00:24.176
You bring Vasily to me or she's dead.

00:24.178 --> 00:25.198
Who is this?

00:25.200 --> 00:27.684
I'm gonna come after
you after I'm gonna kill her.

00:27.686 --> 00:30.355
We are dealing with the
Russian mob here, Ethan.

00:30.356 --> 00:33.025
What if I was to give you
some gangsters?

00:33.026 --> 00:36.526
I mean, that is the whole point to
your little task force, isn't it?

00:37.296 --> 00:38.763
Your weapons.

00:38.764 --> 00:39.964
You okay, Jen?

00:39.965 --> 00:41.299
Bring her to me.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.902
No. We take them both.

00:47.306 --> 00:49.040
Federal Agents!
Drop your weapons!

00:49.041 --> 00:51.042
Drop your weapons!

00:53.979 --> 00:55.647
Ethan!

00:56.382 --> 00:58.183
Ethan!

01:50.703 --> 01:52.371
Can you
describe her body?

01:53.505 --> 01:55.106
Mr. Kelly?

01:55.107 --> 01:57.108
Ethan.

01:57.109 --> 01:59.911
Did Mia have any sort of marks,
tattoos, deformations...

01:59.912 --> 02:01.512
How is this helpful right now?

02:01.513 --> 02:04.048
The more information you give us,
the quicker we can find her.

02:04.049 --> 02:06.718
Mr. Kelly, I promise you, we're doing
everything we can to locate her,

02:06.719 --> 02:08.453
- but given the circumstances...
- No, no, no.

02:08.454 --> 02:10.187
The circumstances are that
I tried to help you guys out

02:10.189 --> 02:12.056
and this is what happened?

02:12.057 --> 02:13.524
Yeah, I'm a little bit fuzzy on
how you were able to do that...

02:13.525 --> 02:16.728
Mr. Dinard gave me a lead
and I followed it.

02:16.729 --> 02:18.863
That's the business I'm in.

02:18.864 --> 02:20.732
The security
business, right?

02:20.733 --> 02:22.200
That's right.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.869
So why not
call the police?

02:24.470 --> 02:26.471
US Marshals?

02:26.472 --> 02:28.339
Let them handle the threat on
Jennifer Alberts and her uncle.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.409
Jen's family was in trouble
because the Marshals screwed up.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.411
Now, why aren't we out looking for Mia

02:33.412 --> 02:35.680
instead of sitting around
and fucking talking about it?

02:35.681 --> 02:38.216
We have road blocks at three
and five miles from the site.

02:38.217 --> 02:40.351
We have an APB out state-wide.

02:40.352 --> 02:42.287
I'm gonna grab a coffee.

02:54.366 --> 02:56.100
I have told you
a thousand times...

02:56.101 --> 02:57.702
I have no idea where they took her.

02:57.703 --> 02:59.303
You can't keep me here all day...

02:59.304 --> 03:01.439
Hey,
excuse me, you can't...

03:01.440 --> 03:03.041
Who took her?

03:03.042 --> 03:04.909
- Get outta here!
- Where the fuck is she?

03:04.910 --> 03:06.644
- Where is she?
- Ethan!

03:12.518 --> 03:14.252
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get the fuck outta here!

03:14.253 --> 03:16.120
You gotta let us do our job.

03:16.121 --> 03:17.989
- Back down! Stand down!
- Who the fuck is he?

03:17.990 --> 03:20.792
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you right now.

03:20.793 --> 03:24.196
All right, we got it.

03:29.601 --> 03:31.602
You can't pull that shit in here.

03:31.603 --> 03:34.672
I'm sorry.
Are you finished with Jen yet?

03:34.673 --> 03:38.409
It's gonna be a little while longer but
you should go home and get some rest.

03:38.410 --> 03:40.144
You're not doing anyone
any good like this.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.214
I'll call you when
we've got something.

03:42.948 --> 03:44.616
Yeah, right.

04:24.456 --> 04:26.258
Zizi?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.993
- Mr. Dinard.
- Where's Zipporah?

04:28.994 --> 04:30.796
At a doctor's appointment.

04:31.263 --> 04:33.397
What's that?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.666
This is a pirate sword.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.336
What happened to your leg?

04:38.470 --> 04:39.670
What do we owe you?

04:39.671 --> 04:41.340
20 bucks.

04:42.474 --> 04:44.742
Here you go.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.611
- I'll see you later, Eli.
- Bye.

04:47.946 --> 04:50.214
- Hey.
- Don't tell Mom.

04:50.215 --> 04:52.216
I'm not gonna tell her,
don't tell her I did that.

05:00.594 --> 05:02.794
Hey.

05:03.295 --> 05:04.563
Hi.

05:05.831 --> 05:08.433
- Here.
- Thanks.

05:10.369 --> 05:12.037
Is there any news on Mia?

05:12.237 --> 05:15.039
Not yet.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.575
- I feel like this is all my fault.
- Well, it's not.

05:17.576 --> 05:19.577
She risked her life for me.
And now...

05:19.578 --> 05:21.513
Now, you need to help her.

05:22.514 --> 05:23.648
How?

05:24.650 --> 05:26.384
Anything you can remember...

05:26.385 --> 05:28.119
Where did they keep you?
Who did you talk to?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.788
I, I already told
the other agents everything.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.726
Well, we're the federal government, Jen,
redundancies are kind of our thing.

05:35.861 --> 05:37.262
Think.

05:39.598 --> 05:40.999
I don't know.

05:43.735 --> 05:45.937
They grabbed me outside of campus.

05:46.672 --> 05:48.206
Brought me to a house...

05:49.208 --> 05:50.609
Who did?

05:52.010 --> 05:54.545
I heard the name,
Ar-something...

05:54.546 --> 05:56.481
- Arkady, I think it was.
- Yeah.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.750
Is that him?

06:01.353 --> 06:02.621
Yeah.

06:03.088 --> 06:04.222
Yes.

06:05.357 --> 06:07.091
What did he say to you?

06:07.092 --> 06:08.559
Did he mention anything about Mia?

06:08.560 --> 06:09.894
No.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.495
What about the others?
Did they say anything?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.565
Nobody said anything to me...

06:20.038 --> 06:22.240
One of them made me tea.

06:22.975 --> 06:24.575
Tea?

06:24.576 --> 06:27.511
Yeah.
He said it would keep me calm.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.715
I don't know. I think he
was just trying to play nice.

06:30.716 --> 06:32.384
What was his name?

06:35.387 --> 06:36.788
I don't know.

06:39.258 --> 06:40.792
Come here for a sec.

06:44.596 --> 06:46.131
Do you see him?

06:47.399 --> 06:49.800
- Yeah.
- Which one?

06:49.801 --> 06:51.470
The one in the blue shirt.

06:54.473 --> 06:55.874
You sure?

06:58.610 --> 07:00.011
That helps.

07:20.365 --> 07:22.099
What're you still doing here?

07:22.100 --> 07:23.635
Waiting for you.

07:23.936 --> 07:25.336
Get in.

07:41.853 --> 07:44.104
- I'm sorry about...
- No, no, forget about it.

07:44.106 --> 07:45.439
It's not your fault.

07:46.391 --> 07:47.858
I'm going to take you home, okay.

07:47.859 --> 07:50.127
Wait, whoa, what? No.

07:50.128 --> 07:52.864
Jen, it's over.
You're out of this.

07:54.132 --> 07:56.667
Go and have a good life.

07:56.668 --> 07:59.538
"Go have a good... Good life?"

08:02.007 --> 08:04.809
My uncle is gone, my dad is gone.

08:04.810 --> 08:07.546
You could've left me, Ethan,
I know that. But you didn't.

08:09.081 --> 08:11.016
I can, I can help.

08:11.883 --> 08:13.151
I know I can help.

08:14.019 --> 08:15.287
Let me help.

08:17.356 --> 08:19.223
Okay.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.777
So, we hear you have
a soft spot for Jen.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.046
You made her tea.

08:42.447 --> 08:44.783
Now, maybe you're not
such a bad guy, Sasha.

08:47.519 --> 08:50.255
Got yourself into a
bit of trouble though.

08:52.190 --> 08:54.392
Says here that you're an engineer.

08:55.394 --> 08:57.928
Graduated St. Petersburg
two years ago.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.331
Is that a good school?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.534
I went to Miami, myself.

09:03.535 --> 09:06.871
It was a bit of a party
school, truth be told.

09:06.872 --> 09:09.006
I had a roommate
who was an engineer though.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.142
Industrial, I think...

09:11.143 --> 09:12.877
He's building bridges
and shit.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.080
- Civil.
- I'm sorry?

09:15.814 --> 09:17.282
Civil engineer build bridge.

09:17.283 --> 09:20.351
Industrial improve system.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.220
Right.

09:22.221 --> 09:24.821
Of course, I mean,
you're the expert. I suppose.

09:26.491 --> 09:29.293
See, I was a philosophy major, myself.

09:29.294 --> 09:30.895
Now, I know, I know exactly
what you're thinking...

09:30.896 --> 09:34.365
"How does a philosophy
major end up at the DEA?"

09:34.366 --> 09:36.100
Well, I'll tell you, Sasha,

09:36.101 --> 09:38.235
there is not a whole lot of money
in the philosophy business.

09:38.236 --> 09:41.172
And those student loans, they don't
pay themselves, now do they?

09:43.175 --> 09:46.110
Hard to get out
from under it, sometimes.

09:46.111 --> 09:47.978
Boy, I remember when I first started,

09:47.979 --> 09:50.648
I took pretty much
any job I could find.

09:50.649 --> 09:53.451
I was fortunate to find my way here...

09:53.452 --> 09:56.520
Doesn't look like you were so lucky.

09:56.521 --> 09:59.257
Career took a bit of a detour?

10:02.794 --> 10:05.130
You see, I see people
like you all the time.

10:06.131 --> 10:08.600
Get promised a nice,
cushy job in America,

10:09.868 --> 10:12.269
but then you get here,
and you find out

10:12.270 --> 10:14.205
it's not quite what you thought.

10:16.007 --> 10:17.275
Am I close?

10:20.278 --> 10:22.146
Listen to me very carefully.

10:22.147 --> 10:25.150
If that girl is still alive,
you have options.

10:26.151 --> 10:27.751
I tell the DA you cooperated,

10:27.752 --> 10:30.421
that you helped to
bring her back safely...

10:30.422 --> 10:32.423
That goes a long way.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.359
And if I don't know anything?

10:36.695 --> 10:39.431
Well, I guess all that hard work
you've put in, goes to waste.

10:44.836 --> 10:46.905
My friends don't know I help you?

10:48.306 --> 10:49.974
We won't say a word.

10:54.179 --> 10:56.381
I think I know where
they are holding her.

11:00.986 --> 11:03.254
I didn't realize you
were a philosophy major.

11:03.255 --> 11:04.588
I'm not.

11:04.589 --> 11:06.457
Didn't go to Miami either.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.026
All right, we got an address.
Let's get a team together.

11:09.028 --> 11:10.011
I'm coming with.

11:10.011 --> 11:11.928
No, you're not. You got
your IA hearing in an hour.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.931
- It can wait.
- No. No. It can't.

11:13.932 --> 11:15.533
These are not the kind of people
you want to piss off, Deakins.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.335
- I'm not gonna sit around and...
- No!

11:18.336 --> 11:19.403
So they don't kick
your ass out of here.

11:19.404 --> 11:21.005
This is more important.

11:21.006 --> 11:23.274
No, hey. No, it's not.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.210
That girl is already dead.

11:25.944 --> 11:27.612
You know it as well as I do.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.347
I need you back to 100%,

11:30.348 --> 11:32.150
so this kinda shit
doesn't happen again.

11:33.285 --> 11:35.220
All right, let's go.

11:49.301 --> 11:51.035
Who is this guy?

11:51.036 --> 11:53.304
He's our lawyer. Used to be.

11:53.305 --> 11:55.573
Why would he know where Mia is?

11:55.574 --> 11:57.174
I don't know that he does,

11:57.175 --> 11:59.377
I just know he's involved
right now, and he's MIA.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.714
You know, just do your thing.
Come on, come on.

12:03.715 --> 12:06.784
Right, okay.
Read me both of their numbers.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.720
Marty's first and then Betsy's.

12:09.988 --> 12:12.056
Marty is...

12:12.657 --> 12:17.194
312-555-0159.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.397
- Okay, next.
- Betsy's...

12:20.265 --> 12:24.668
312-555-0187.

12:24.669 --> 12:26.804
Okay. What do you
want the text to say?

12:26.805 --> 12:30.007
Put, "Union Station.

12:30.008 --> 12:32.009
"Platform three.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.078
"Pick me up
in 30 minutes."

13:10.982 --> 13:12.850
Agent Deakins.

13:12.851 --> 13:14.184
Have a seat.

13:15.787 --> 13:18.589
I'm Agent Ward, this is Agent Powell.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.192
Hi.

13:22.327 --> 13:24.662
Let's get started, shall we?

13:42.213 --> 13:44.148
Federal agents!
Open up!

13:45.684 --> 13:48.686
Federal Agents! We have a warrant!
Open the door!

13:50.488 --> 13:52.023
Go.

13:57.429 --> 13:59.364
Go, go, go.

14:03.835 --> 14:05.503
Eyes wide, eyes wide.

14:15.313 --> 14:19.450
During your
DEA entrance interview

14:19.451 --> 14:22.386
you were asked the following question,

14:22.387 --> 14:25.723
"Have you or any of your
friends or family ever used,

14:25.724 --> 14:28.993
"possessed or distributed
a Schedule I narcotic?"

14:31.596 --> 14:32.864
Okay.

14:33.732 --> 14:35.599
You answered in the negative.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.268
Is that correct?

14:38.536 --> 14:40.671
That's correct.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.741
You and Jack Glencoe were currently

14:43.742 --> 14:46.677
in a relationship at the
time of that interview?

14:46.678 --> 14:48.946
Remind me of the date.

14:48.947 --> 14:52.350
October 14, the year 2012.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.352
Yes.

14:55.353 --> 14:59.757
Given Mr. Glencoe's
history on drug abuse,

14:59.758 --> 15:01.826
would you care to explain your answer?

15:04.162 --> 15:05.563
I lied.

15:30.455 --> 15:34.057
<i>Special Agent Nate Lowry</i>

15:34.058 --> 15:36.193
briefed us on your helpfulness during

15:36.194 --> 15:39.930
a recent Russian mafia takedown.

15:39.931 --> 15:42.642
He seems to feel that you are an

15:42.644 --> 15:45.386
indispensable member
of this task force.

15:46.604 --> 15:48.539
Well, that's nice to hear.

15:58.216 --> 16:01.819
We also received a letter
from your former pa,

16:01.820 --> 16:04.755
CPD Detective Patrick Finnegan.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.958
"Working with Harper Deakins
for a period of five months...

16:07.959 --> 16:11.295
"In that time, I have come to know her
as an agent of the highest caliber,

16:11.296 --> 16:13.030
"possessing exceptional fortitude,

16:13.031 --> 16:17.167
"strength of character,
and unimpeachable integrity."

16:17.168 --> 16:20.771
"She remains a sterling example
of the fundamental values

16:20.772 --> 16:24.575
"and ideals that the Chicago
Gang Task Force aims to uphold."

16:25.977 --> 16:28.312
I didn't know he knew such long words.

16:41.593 --> 16:45.062
Anything you'd like to say
on your behalf

16:45.063 --> 16:47.131
before we make our recommendation?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.801
I haven't been perfect.

16:51.603 --> 16:54.338
I've made mistakes.

16:55.874 --> 16:59.076
And sometimes my
methods are misguided,

16:59.077 --> 17:01.745
but never my motives.

17:01.746 --> 17:06.817
<i>I lied about my boyfriend's
drug use because I wanted the job.</i>

17:06.818 --> 17:09.887
<i>And yes, I used my
position as a federal officer</i>

17:09.887 --> 17:14.023
<i>to get him off what I believed to
be an unfair and bogus charge.</i>

17:14.025 --> 17:16.894
<i>I take full responsibility
for those mistakes.</i>

17:18.429 --> 17:20.098
Jesus.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.434
I...

17:24.435 --> 17:26.569
I ask only that you take into account

17:26.570 --> 17:29.440
my entire record before
making your decision.

17:45.123 --> 17:46.990
Guess you're stuck with me.

17:46.991 --> 17:49.393
They're giving me back my badge.

17:49.394 --> 17:50.795
Hey.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.998
She's dead, isn't she?
Mia's dead?

17:54.999 --> 17:56.733
We didn't find her.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.002
House was empty.

17:58.603 --> 17:59.803
Then, what?

17:59.804 --> 18:01.939
Picked up something else though...

18:01.940 --> 18:04.207
Her jacket, covered in blood.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.275
Mia's?

18:05.276 --> 18:07.345
Found this inside the pocket.

18:17.422 --> 18:18.755
I don't understand.

18:18.756 --> 18:20.891
What would the Russians want...

18:20.892 --> 18:23.692
Could this have something to do with
what we talked about the other day?

18:23.695 --> 18:24.829
What?

18:26.764 --> 18:29.166
Is it possible that Patrick
was still working with Stein?

18:29.167 --> 18:30.434
No.

18:32.637 --> 18:33.905
Fuck no.

18:36.107 --> 18:37.642
Hey.

18:39.177 --> 18:40.311
Eli?

18:43.314 --> 18:44.849
Kayla?

18:45.717 --> 18:47.118
Argh!

18:47.852 --> 18:49.319
What is going on here?

18:52.391 --> 18:54.925
What happened to you?

18:54.926 --> 18:58.662
Argh! Giant octopus
took a chunk outta me.

18:58.663 --> 19:00.797
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

19:02.400 --> 19:05.202
It's true, Ma, I seen it happen.

19:05.203 --> 19:07.004
Eli, go to your room for a second.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.407
- But...
- Now.

19:10.008 --> 19:11.409
Trade you?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.945
Okay.

19:21.219 --> 19:22.620
You okay?

19:23.221 --> 19:25.222
Yeah, a mishap at work.

19:25.223 --> 19:27.224
I'm sorry about your vase, baby.

19:27.225 --> 19:28.759
What kind of mishap?

19:30.161 --> 19:33.431
Snagged on a rusty nail
on the door frame.

19:35.366 --> 19:37.568
And you need
crutches for a rusty nail?

19:39.237 --> 19:41.839
They only gave me
about a week to live.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.114
- Let me see it.
- Why?

19:51.115 --> 19:52.917
'Cause I don't believe you.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.186
This how it's always gonna be?

19:56.187 --> 19:58.588
I don't know, you tell me.

19:58.589 --> 20:00.658
Baby, you gotta give me a break.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.795
I'm giving you a chance
to tell me the truth.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.999
It's like I said.
There was a rusty nail.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.602
Hospital gave me these crutches
and I got a tetanus shot.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.891
- Let me know when.
- Okay.

20:34.892 --> 20:37.361
Hey, but not yet, just a second.

20:41.566 --> 20:43.100
Okay, there.

21:06.124 --> 21:07.858
What exactly
are we looking for?

21:07.859 --> 21:10.393
Anything that tells us where
Marty might have gone

21:10.394 --> 21:12.196
or what he knows about Mia.

21:13.464 --> 21:16.067
- Start looking through here.
- Okay.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.206
Here we go.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.143
What'd you find?

22:32.743 --> 22:34.545
Different name.

22:35.279 --> 22:37.214
Different life story.

22:40.618 --> 22:43.354
Take this and that one there.

23:10.781 --> 23:12.249
Anything?

23:12.250 --> 23:14.651
He says that's where they were holding
her, and that's all he knows.

23:14.652 --> 23:16.653
Swears he knows nothing about Patrick.

23:16.654 --> 23:18.388
- You talked to CPD?
- Yeah.

23:18.389 --> 23:20.257
Yeah, I had a conversation
with his lieutenant,

23:20.258 --> 23:21.848
went through all his case files.

23:21.849 --> 23:24.928
There's nothing in there that should've
put him anywhere near those Russians.

23:24.929 --> 23:26.930
It doesn't make any sense...

23:26.931 --> 23:28.665
Sometimes it doesn't.

23:28.666 --> 23:30.533
You cross the wrong person...

23:30.534 --> 23:32.269
Never see it coming till it comes.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.537
You trying to tell me that
law enforcement's dangerous?

23:34.538 --> 23:36.273
Yeah.

23:36.274 --> 23:38.476
It gets even more dangerous
when you play both sides.

23:39.343 --> 23:41.211
I'm going to the house.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.880
There's nothing there, team's
already been through it.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.950
Beats sitting around here.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.551
Right.

24:03.768 --> 24:06.637
Hello, good looking.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.310
Seems like just yesterday that was us.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.313
Yeah.

24:16.314 --> 24:17.647
That was a wonderful evening.

24:17.648 --> 24:19.450
I'll say.

24:20.451 --> 24:22.852
You know, I called your office.

24:22.853 --> 24:25.522
They say you don't work there anymore.

24:25.523 --> 24:27.390
Someone had to stick with Marty.

24:27.391 --> 24:29.659
I stuck with him
and they kicked me out.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.729
I never pegged you as the loyal type.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.855
Still sour things didn't work
out between us?

24:36.734 --> 24:38.735
Sophie...

24:38.736 --> 24:41.071
I'm looking for Marty
and I can't locate him.

24:43.541 --> 24:45.743
You and me both.

24:47.144 --> 24:48.946
Scout's honor.

24:52.216 --> 24:55.219
I came across some of your work
recently. Go ahead, take a look.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.193
Mind telling me about this?

25:06.330 --> 25:07.931
Sorry. Can't help you.

25:07.932 --> 25:10.334
Yeah? Why is that?

25:10.335 --> 25:11.935
Because I don't know
why you're asking.

25:11.936 --> 25:14.070
Well, a friend of mine is in trouble.

25:14.071 --> 25:16.140
Always seems to be the case with you.

25:17.541 --> 25:20.811
I'm being serious, Sophie.
And I'm asking, please.

25:23.948 --> 25:25.949
Look, I think Marty's in a situation.

25:25.950 --> 25:28.751
- What kind of situation?
- The bad kind.

25:28.752 --> 25:31.688
The time-sensitive kind.

25:31.689 --> 25:33.891
You think this girl
has something to do with it?

25:34.492 --> 25:37.427
I mean, it's a theory.

25:37.428 --> 25:40.096
Look, if something happens
to Marty, it's bad for me,

25:40.097 --> 25:43.433
but it's even worse for you.
The firm doesn't want you.

25:43.434 --> 25:45.235
And Marty's your meal ticket now.

25:50.508 --> 25:52.176
Okay, Sophie.

25:54.378 --> 25:56.513
Marty came to me
about four weeks ago.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.582
Asked me to look into this girl.

25:59.984 --> 26:01.317
Look into her how?

26:01.318 --> 26:02.333
He...

26:02.335 --> 26:03.732
He wanted to know
if there was a connection

26:03.734 --> 26:05.988
between her and this guy, Wu...

26:06.474 --> 26:08.740
- Wu?
- Yeah, Leonard Wu.

26:09.492 --> 26:10.610
And who is he?

26:10.680 --> 26:13.555
I don't know, it was a month
ago, what do you want?

26:14.265 --> 26:16.399
I want to know.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.401
I think he was a geologist,
or something.

26:18.402 --> 26:20.136
- A geologist?
- Yeah. I think.

26:20.137 --> 26:21.871
Look, I couldn't find
what Marty was looking for,

26:21.872 --> 26:23.540
so why does any of this matter?

26:25.075 --> 26:26.744
I'll let you know.

26:27.344 --> 26:29.413
It's good to see you, Sophie.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.375
- Can I help you?
- Good afternoon.

26:59.376 --> 27:02.712
Special Agent Nate Lowry with
the Chicago Gang Taskforce.

27:02.713 --> 27:04.515
I'm looking for Marlon Dinard.

27:05.516 --> 27:07.917
Marlon's out. What'd he do?

27:09.271 --> 27:12.455
Well, actually, Mr. Dinard's
been assisting us recently.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.457
Came by to deliver some good news.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.527
It's not too often I get to do that.

27:17.509 --> 27:19.321
Okay.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.365
Well, if you could let Marlon
know that the paperwork

27:22.366 --> 27:24.902
for his asset forfeiture
has gone through.

27:24.903 --> 27:27.970
Looks like he'll be getting
his store back.

27:27.971 --> 27:31.307
- Well, that is good news.
- Yeah.

27:31.308 --> 27:33.243
How's he holding up, by the way?

27:33.844 --> 27:35.177
What do you mean?

27:35.178 --> 27:36.713
His leg.

27:38.248 --> 27:41.384
You mean the one that
he caught on the rusty nail?

27:42.386 --> 27:44.387
Right. Yeah, well...

27:44.388 --> 27:46.522
It seemed pretty bad, so I just
thought I'd check in on him.

27:46.523 --> 27:48.257
Yeah.

27:48.258 --> 27:51.727
Look, why don't you just have him
give me a call when he gets in.

27:51.728 --> 27:54.064
- Right.
- Will do.

27:54.398 --> 27:55.932
Thank you.

28:17.354 --> 28:19.956
Hey, how'd it go?

28:24.027 --> 28:26.028
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:26.029 --> 28:27.964
Yeah. Of course, I just...

28:30.033 --> 28:31.767
It's nothing.

28:31.768 --> 28:33.235
What did she say?

28:33.236 --> 28:35.237
Not much.

28:36.573 --> 28:38.508
I can see why you two get along.

28:40.711 --> 28:42.245
You know, Jen,

28:43.513 --> 28:45.849
if you want to go home, I understand.

28:46.050 --> 28:49.251
No.

28:49.252 --> 28:50.921
I'm sorry, it's just...

28:52.456 --> 28:55.192
- It just kinda comes
in waves, you know?

29:04.868 --> 29:07.871
Stop staring at me.
Yes, I'm crying.

29:08.472 --> 29:10.606
What did you get?

29:10.607 --> 29:13.809
I got a name...
Leonard Wu.

29:13.810 --> 29:15.411
Who's that?

29:15.412 --> 29:19.148
Marty seems to think that Mia and
him are connected in some way.

29:19.149 --> 29:21.778
There's hundreds of them,
that's not really promising.

29:21.780 --> 29:22.698
Got anything else?

29:22.700 --> 29:25.341
Well, Sophie said that
he's a geologist.

29:25.443 --> 29:28.224
Geologist, um...

29:28.225 --> 29:30.893
All right, I got a Leonard Wu.
LM Dorr and Company.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.230
It's an independent
mine auditing firm.

29:34.364 --> 29:37.166
Check this out.

29:37.167 --> 29:40.903
"A private aircraft
crashed in southeast Utah, Wednesday.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.905
"The plane was reported
overdue in the afternoon

29:42.906 --> 29:44.640
"when it did not arrive
at its destination.

29:44.641 --> 29:47.310
"All three on board were
killed including the pilot,

29:47.311 --> 29:50.780
"Timothy Rigby, and
two senior LM Dorr auditors,

29:50.781 --> 29:53.716
"Samantha Jordan,
and Leonard Wu."

35:32.992 --> 35:36.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:36.993 --> 35:38.994
Found another one, 30 yards west.

35:38.995 --> 35:40.596
Another body
or another site?

35:40.597 --> 35:42.598
I don't know, we'll find out
soon enough...

35:42.599 --> 35:44.066
So, what's the tally?

35:44.067 --> 35:45.667
It's eight so far.

35:45.668 --> 35:48.604
They think one of the
graves might be a double.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.406
Did the team say anything about...

35:51.674 --> 35:54.610
Listen, everything
they've pulled up so far...

35:54.611 --> 35:56.412
It's been there a while.

35:57.414 --> 35:58.548
Okay.

36:09.559 --> 36:11.693
Can I ask you something?

36:11.694 --> 36:13.496
What the hell are you
still doing here?

36:14.764 --> 36:16.365
What?

36:16.366 --> 36:20.102
I mean, you're breaking into homes
and offices, mobster shoot-outs...

36:20.103 --> 36:21.837
Mia's a client.

36:21.838 --> 36:25.174
Client for what?
What do you actually do?

36:25.175 --> 36:26.642
What do you mean what do I do?

36:26.643 --> 36:29.711
Are you a private investigator,
are you a body-guard? I...

36:29.712 --> 36:33.982
You know what, you could call me like
a, I guess a jack of all trades.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.451
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:35.452 --> 36:37.853
Well, what exactly do you get
paid for all of that, Jack?

36:37.854 --> 36:40.389
I see you want
a little cut of the action.

36:40.390 --> 36:42.524
- I didn't say that.
- Well.

36:42.525 --> 36:44.126
Hey, you know what?
Don't turn this around on me,

36:44.127 --> 36:46.395
I know exactly why I'm here.
Those guys killed my father.

36:46.396 --> 36:48.530
But as far as I can tell, you
don't have a dog in this fight.

36:48.531 --> 36:50.132
No.

36:50.133 --> 36:52.335
Everything's not
always that clear cut.

36:53.203 --> 36:54.737
Are you fucking her?

36:55.738 --> 36:57.739
No.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.275
Holy shit. Yes, you are!

37:00.276 --> 37:02.411
Teetonka.

37:02.412 --> 37:04.146
Fine, I'll be quiet.

37:04.147 --> 37:05.481
No, I want you to look it up.

37:05.482 --> 37:07.082
I don't need to look it up.
I know what it means.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.550
Teetonka, "talks too much" in Sioux.

37:08.551 --> 37:10.018
No, no, Teetonka Chicago Inc.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.221
It was Leonard Wu's
last job before he died.

37:15.225 --> 37:16.425
So you speak
Sioux?

37:16.426 --> 37:18.427
My mother's Native American.

37:18.428 --> 37:23.098
So, you're Russian, Chinese and
Native American, is that right?

37:23.099 --> 37:25.367
I never said I was Chinese.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.835
Just fucking with you.

37:26.836 --> 37:28.704
I'm pretty much the poster child

37:28.705 --> 37:30.706
for the benefits of
interracial breeding.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.975
Teetonka Chicago Inc.

37:32.976 --> 37:34.777
It's a uranium mine in Utah.

37:35.111 --> 37:36.845
Uranium?

37:36.846 --> 37:38.580
Looks like they're a subsidiary
of some Russian company,

37:38.581 --> 37:40.449
Bershov Industrial.

37:40.450 --> 37:43.386
Max Bershov owns Teetonka?

37:43.387 --> 37:44.586
You know the guy?

37:44.587 --> 37:46.321
Well, I know of him.
I mean, he...

37:46.322 --> 37:48.590
He pretty much
outfitted half the...

37:48.591 --> 37:51.660
Private security companies that I
worked for over in Afghanistan.

37:51.661 --> 37:52.995
An arms manufacturer?

37:52.996 --> 37:55.397
Yeah, something like that.

37:55.398 --> 37:58.600
Who runs their American operations?

37:58.601 --> 38:02.204
Looks like their chief operating
officer is a Tilda Switzer.

38:02.205 --> 38:03.740
Let me see.

38:17.954 --> 38:19.288
Hey.

38:19.289 --> 38:20.889
Eat something.

38:20.890 --> 38:23.025
This stuff will kill you.

38:23.026 --> 38:24.293
You promise?

38:27.163 --> 38:28.698
You should go home.

38:29.832 --> 38:31.700
And do what?

38:31.701 --> 38:33.503
I don't know, sleep?

38:35.305 --> 38:38.106
I came here because
I wanted to find something,

38:38.107 --> 38:40.309
you know, something we missed,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.312
hoping he was alive...

38:43.313 --> 38:45.515
Maybe they were holding
him somewhere...

38:46.916 --> 38:49.652
And now, with all of this,
and the waiting...

38:52.789 --> 38:56.726
I just want to know,
you know, get it over with.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.596
Thanks.

39:02.398 --> 39:03.732
You should
get out of here.

39:03.733 --> 39:04.933
- Come on.
- No.

39:04.934 --> 39:06.535
Yeah, you're torturing yourself.

39:06.536 --> 39:09.605
- Doesn't matter.
- It does matter.

39:09.606 --> 39:12.274
It matters because
the fallout from this

39:12.275 --> 39:15.278
is gonna cause a shitstorm in the
morning and I need you at your best.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.282
- What about you?
- What about me?

39:20.283 --> 39:22.150
I'll be outta here in an hour.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.487
Right, any updates,
I'll let you know. Go on.

39:25.888 --> 39:27.623
Go!

39:27.624 --> 39:29.158
- All right.
- Okay.

40:10.733 --> 40:13.069
I was never very fond of carnations.

40:14.203 --> 40:17.406
Well, I thought it was
the thought that counts.

40:17.407 --> 40:18.674
Says who?

40:19.942 --> 40:21.477
Boy.

40:23.813 --> 40:25.547
What the hell is wrong now?

40:25.548 --> 40:27.350
Nothing's wrong.

40:29.018 --> 40:31.087
In fact, I got good news for you.

40:31.821 --> 40:34.290
It really looks like it.

40:35.425 --> 40:38.226
An Agent Lowry stopped by,

40:38.227 --> 40:40.896
said your assets
are getting un-seized.

40:40.897 --> 40:44.366
No shit. Wow.

40:44.367 --> 40:46.435
Looks like you're getting
your store back.

40:47.837 --> 40:51.973
That's... Man, that's, that's
good news, you know!

40:51.974 --> 40:54.509
At least now I don't feel so
bad throwing your ass out.

40:54.510 --> 40:58.647
- Hey, what you mean...
- Don't touch me.

40:58.648 --> 41:01.450
I'm asking you what
you're talking about.

41:01.451 --> 41:03.052
He asked about your leg, Marlon.

41:03.053 --> 41:05.187
So?

41:05.188 --> 41:07.924
The man wasn't asking
about a rusty nail scratch.

41:08.524 --> 41:10.125
- Hey...
- You lied to me.

41:10.126 --> 41:12.394
I didn't want to tell you
because I knew you'd get upset.

41:12.395 --> 41:14.330
Mission accomplished.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.061
I was working with the Feds
on this kidnapping case.

41:20.063 --> 41:21.221
You know what,
you might as well just stick

41:21.221 --> 41:22.954
with your giant
octopus story, 'cause...

41:22.956 --> 41:24.473
Did you just hear what...

41:26.008 --> 41:29.077
A client of the security firm, they...

41:29.078 --> 41:32.081
They got into some trouble
and I just wanted to help out.

41:32.815 --> 41:34.350
You're working with the Feds?

41:36.285 --> 41:39.021
I didn't want to tell you, because
I knew how you'd react.

41:41.624 --> 41:44.025
What happened to your leg?

41:44.026 --> 41:46.161
I got caught with a ricochet.

41:46.162 --> 41:49.031
- A bullet?
- Yes, a bullet!

41:55.371 --> 41:56.906
Get your stuff,

41:57.507 --> 41:58.974
get out of my house.

41:58.975 --> 42:01.043
Did you not hear what I just said?

42:02.445 --> 42:05.581
Did you... I said
I was working with the police!

42:06.849 --> 42:09.518
I'm trying to do good by you and Eli.

42:09.519 --> 42:11.920
You lie too easily, Marlon.

42:11.921 --> 42:14.456
I can't have this around Eli.

42:14.457 --> 42:15.858
That's it?

42:19.262 --> 42:20.729
That's it?

42:20.730 --> 42:22.731
That's what you're saying to me?

42:22.732 --> 42:25.801
Look me in my face
and tell me that that's it.

42:25.802 --> 42:29.205
After everything. Look me
in my face and tell me that.

42:30.606 --> 42:32.141
Get out.

43:15.451 --> 43:18.120
Thought you said the stock
was worth 200 a share.

43:18.121 --> 43:19.588
It is. Why?

43:19.589 --> 43:22.924
Well, Tilda's sitting up there
running the whole damn operation.

43:22.925 --> 43:24.259
What do you mean?

43:24.260 --> 43:27.930
I mean, Teetonka is five
people sitting in an office.

43:30.533 --> 43:31.801
There she is.

43:34.537 --> 43:37.072
I mean, their stock's been
skyrocketing in the last six months

43:37.073 --> 43:38.273
with her at the helm.

43:38.274 --> 43:40.542
Maybe they don't need anybody else.

43:40.543 --> 43:42.010
What else did you find out about her?

43:42.011 --> 43:43.345
Nothing, really.

43:43.346 --> 43:46.414
On paper, she's the very model
of the modern major COO.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.616
Fellow Harvard alum...

43:47.617 --> 43:50.018
Well, I guess you're
not really an alum...

43:50.019 --> 43:52.020
Spent two years at an investment bank,

43:52.021 --> 43:53.889
a Moscow hedge fund for four,

43:53.890 --> 43:56.558
moved into commodities, and then
took over Teetonka nine months ago.

43:56.559 --> 43:58.293
Did you find out any dirt, Jennifer?

43:58.294 --> 44:00.295
She plays Ultimate Frisbee
on the weekends.

44:00.296 --> 44:02.697
I guess that's kind of embarrassing.

44:02.698 --> 44:05.634
What about text messages, e-mails,
phone, something, come on?

44:05.635 --> 44:07.235
Encrypted.

44:07.236 --> 44:09.371
Encrypted. Well, mine were
encrypted but you found a way in.

44:09.372 --> 44:10.705
That was different.

44:10.706 --> 44:12.841
Yeah. Why?

44:12.842 --> 44:15.978
I was working right next to you, I
just paired my device to yours.

44:17.380 --> 44:18.713
What do you mean?

44:18.714 --> 44:20.715
Cell phone next to cell phone.

44:20.716 --> 44:22.584
Nobody ever protects
their Bluetooth network.

44:22.585 --> 44:25.253
Well, not as much as they
protect everything else.

44:25.254 --> 44:27.056
It's just an easier point of entry.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.594
- Sneaky little bitch.
- Excuse me?

44:44.340 --> 44:46.275
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:51.280 --> 44:53.014
Thank you.

44:53.015 --> 44:54.683
Thank you.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.954
How you doing?

45:00.489 --> 45:01.891
Better than some.

45:02.892 --> 45:05.094
Yeah, well...

45:11.033 --> 45:14.837
Um, anyone told his girlfriend yet?

45:15.438 --> 45:17.439
No.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.708
I'm not looking forward
to that conversation.

45:19.709 --> 45:22.644
Yeah, well, I obviously
didn't mean it should be you.

45:22.645 --> 45:24.980
Why? Why, "obviously,"
shouldn't it be me?

45:27.717 --> 45:30.186
Well, for starters, you're
in love with her boyfriend.

45:32.922 --> 45:36.058
- I'm not... I'm not in love.
- Yeah.

45:36.792 --> 45:38.060
Yeah, you are.

45:41.063 --> 45:42.464
Jesus.

45:44.400 --> 45:46.534
How sad am I?

45:46.535 --> 45:49.805
Everyone always realizes how much
they love someone once they're gone.

45:51.607 --> 45:53.074
Is that right?

45:53.075 --> 45:55.477
Yeah. Yeah, well...

45:55.478 --> 45:57.413
You know, that's how
I knew we were done.

45:57.414 --> 46:00.314
What, you weren't in love
with me after I was gone?

46:01.083 --> 46:02.484
No, I was.

46:03.219 --> 46:04.620
But you weren't.

46:06.555 --> 46:09.224
I was more relieved
than anything else, yeah.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.293
Fuck you, I knew you were, too.

46:12.161 --> 46:13.629
Wait, how long?

46:13.630 --> 46:16.333
- How long did...
- Did I know about Patrick?

46:17.233 --> 46:19.568
Ooh, I don't know.
It doesn't matter, does it?

46:21.370 --> 46:22.504
Guess not.

46:24.974 --> 46:27.843
So, you knew, and you were
going to propose anyway?

46:29.645 --> 46:31.513
Well, you see...

46:31.514 --> 46:34.917
You're sort of an emotionally
stunted woman, Harper Deakins.

46:35.785 --> 46:37.269
Sorry, but it's true. And I...

46:37.271 --> 46:38.425
You know, you might
have gone your whole life

46:38.427 --> 46:39.787
without ever figuring it out.

46:39.789 --> 46:42.590
I wasn't going to say anything, so...

46:42.591 --> 46:43.925
I don't know. I didn't
think it would matter,

46:43.926 --> 46:45.728
you know, once I made
you blissfully happy.

46:48.064 --> 46:49.664
Well played, Glencoe.

46:49.665 --> 46:52.268
Almost. Almost well played.

46:56.205 --> 46:58.606
While we're on the subject...

46:58.607 --> 47:00.875
Who is the...

47:00.876 --> 47:03.278
Who is the young girl
who answered your phone?

47:03.279 --> 47:05.814
The young lady's name is Maddie.

47:05.815 --> 47:07.816
It's early stages, though, so...

47:07.817 --> 47:09.150
I don't know.

47:09.151 --> 47:10.351
So, what, is she twelve?

47:10.352 --> 47:13.088
Madison is her name
and she's a doctor.

47:14.090 --> 47:16.224
She's going to be a doctor

47:16.225 --> 47:17.920
when she, when she
finishes university...

47:17.922 --> 47:19.561
...and then goes to med school.

47:26.502 --> 47:27.636
Deakins.

47:28.504 --> 47:31.306
Yeah. No, I'm on my way.

47:31.307 --> 47:32.508
What's up?

47:32.509 --> 47:35.844
That's that's Lowry.
He's got something.

47:35.845 --> 47:37.312
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, thank you.

47:37.313 --> 47:38.580
Yeah.

47:49.592 --> 47:50.859
Thank you.

47:55.464 --> 47:58.600
Excuse me, sir.
Can I get a Maker's, please?

48:05.074 --> 48:06.475
Thanks.

48:09.612 --> 48:11.746
You know, what's unfortunate
is that's the one novel

48:11.747 --> 48:14.149
of his that I identify the most with.

48:14.150 --> 48:16.684
<i>Philip Roth. The Human Stain?</i>

48:16.685 --> 48:19.555
Well, that's why
I said it's unfortunate.

48:21.490 --> 48:22.957
You must be a professor.

48:22.958 --> 48:25.360
Nah, no.

48:25.361 --> 48:28.497
I just don't think that you've
read that far into the book.

48:47.116 --> 48:48.449
Got you.

48:48.450 --> 48:49.784
I don't believe you.

48:49.785 --> 48:51.519
Really.

48:51.520 --> 48:53.521
My hand to God, I promise.

48:53.522 --> 48:55.123
People need more common sense.

48:55.124 --> 48:57.792
"Common sense
isn't so common."

48:57.793 --> 48:59.928
You know that, come on now.

48:59.929 --> 49:02.063
Are you trying to sound smart
by quoting Voltaire?

49:02.064 --> 49:04.400
Nobody sounds smart quoting Voltaire.

49:07.136 --> 49:08.336
- That's the truth.
- Yeah.

49:10.739 --> 49:12.473
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

49:12.474 --> 49:13.675
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

49:13.676 --> 49:15.077
Yeah, yeah, sure.

49:19.148 --> 49:20.348
Hello?

49:20.349 --> 49:21.683
<i>Can you speak?</i>

49:21.684 --> 49:22.750
Yes.

49:22.751 --> 49:24.619
<i>It's done.</i>

49:24.620 --> 49:26.087
<i>Mia Rochlan is dead.</i>

49:26.088 --> 49:27.356
Fuck.

49:28.624 --> 49:30.225
<i>What about
the Stein situation?</i>

49:30.226 --> 49:33.428
<i>Progressing.
Should have update soon.</i>

49:33.429 --> 49:35.563
Let me know.

49:35.564 --> 49:37.966
And I have
Ethan Kelly here with me.

49:37.967 --> 49:41.436
I can keep him occupied, if you'd
like to take care of this tonight.

49:41.437 --> 49:42.838
<i>Hold on.</i>

49:45.307 --> 49:47.041
<i>Where are you now?</i>

49:47.042 --> 49:48.776
At dinner.

49:48.777 --> 49:51.246
<i>Bring him
back to your place.</i>

49:53.048 --> 49:54.716
<i>- We'll be waiting.
- Fuck.</i>

49:57.453 --> 49:59.454
Cheers. Thanks.

49:59.455 --> 50:00.788
I'm so sorry.

50:00.789 --> 50:02.123
Work.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.659
So, where were we?

51:30.879 --> 51:32.213
Federal Agent!
Drop your weapon!

51:32.214 --> 51:33.948
Exit the office with your hands up!

51:37.686 --> 51:39.621
Come out with your hands up!
