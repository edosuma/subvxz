00:15.241 --> 00:16.758
Yesterday, a detonated explosive

00:16.862 --> 00:19.103

00:19.206 --> 00:21.206
<i>and civilian reporter
Julia Johnson.</i>

00:21.310 --> 00:24.275
We've identified the perpetrator
as Kevin Golden.

00:24.379 --> 00:25.827
<i>The FBI has reason to believe</i>

00:25.931 --> 00:28.068
that Mr. Golden's accomplice
in yesterday's attack

00:28.172 --> 00:31.482
was Texas Ranger
Cordell Walker.

00:31.586 --> 00:34.379
A violent man needs to be
brought to justice, that's all.

00:43.137 --> 00:45.172
My people will be reaching out
for an official statement,

00:45.275 --> 00:47.827
but Mr. Cooper's confirmed
your innocence.

00:48.689 --> 00:50.586
Kevin played all of us, Cass,
not just you.

00:50.689 --> 00:52.413
Oh, my God, you're not
getting it.

00:52.517 --> 00:53.896
Have you even stopped
to think what

00:54.000 --> 00:55.275
it's been like for me
since that C4 went off?

00:55.379 --> 00:56.793
So you know what,
maybe you could

00:56.896 --> 00:58.655
just back the hell off.

01:22.793 --> 01:24.586
- You were teasing her, right?
- Yeah.

01:24.689 --> 01:25.965
I smell coffee.
Oh! Hey!
Hey!

01:26.068 --> 01:27.241
What's up, Dad?
- Hey, hey.

01:27.344 --> 01:29.551
- I just made it fresh.
- Perfect timing.

01:29.655 --> 01:30.551
Look at that.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.137
So what did the doctor say?

01:32.241 --> 01:34.206
Well, I...

01:34.310 --> 01:36.379
passed my two-week checkup
with flying colors.

01:36.482 --> 01:37.758
They do want me to carry on

01:37.862 --> 01:39.517
with, uh, physical therapy
though, so...

01:39.620 --> 01:41.965
- Well, you had your bell rung.
- Yeah.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.931
I just can't wait to tell Geri
in person thank you

01:44.034 --> 01:45.586
for getting you through that.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.931
Ah, great.

01:47.034 --> 01:48.586
There's, uh, there's
more bacon on the stove.

01:48.689 --> 01:50.689
Ah.
Hey, did Geri ever

01:50.793 --> 01:52.275
tell you what kept her
gone so long?

01:52.379 --> 01:54.413
Uh, when she's ready.

01:54.517 --> 01:57.103
Mmm, she's actually stopping
by The Side Step today.

01:57.206 --> 02:00.551
Um... Uh, Stella Blue, did she
text you or Colton what time?

02:00.655 --> 02:02.689
Uh, no, not yet.
And Colton actually left

02:02.793 --> 02:05.344
- for Vegas this morning.
- No way!
That's actually happening?

02:05.448 --> 02:07.172
Mm-hmm.
What-what...
what's happening?

02:07.275 --> 02:09.517
Colton's in Vegas? Okay.

02:09.620 --> 02:12.034
You better not be planning to
meet him there and get married,

02:12.137 --> 02:13.620
because if he proposed to you Okay,
no way in the world

02:13.724 --> 02:15.034
- she would go to Vegas...
- ...without calling

02:15.137 --> 02:16.448
- your daddy first...
- ...to marry

02:16.551 --> 02:18.034
when she has a perfectly
good venue right here.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.620
No, no. No. There is a chef
there. Colton submitted

02:19.724 --> 02:21.275
to this culinary internship
a while back.

02:21.379 --> 02:23.793
He didn't get in,
but the person that they picked

02:23.896 --> 02:25.241
dropped out and they called him.

02:25.344 --> 02:26.482
It happened
kind of all of sudden.

02:26.586 --> 02:28.137
- That's fantastic!
- That's great!

02:28.241 --> 02:30.551
- That's big.
- Wait, so I basically have
free reign

02:30.655 --> 02:32.482
to run the concert
for the horse rescue tonight?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.448
Oh. We should go. Stel, Augie...
- Mm-hmm.

02:34.551 --> 02:36.344
Let's get going if I'm gonna
drop you off at The Side Step.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.551
What are you up to today?

02:37.655 --> 02:39.068
I'm gonna hang out with Ben

02:39.172 --> 02:40.517
before the concert, so I'll, uh,

02:40.620 --> 02:41.896
I'll see you later.
See you later.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.068
Come on, kids.

02:43.172 --> 02:44.275
Uh... Love you, Augie.

02:44.379 --> 02:45.551
- Love you, Stella.
- Drive safe!

02:45.655 --> 02:47.344
I love you!
Careful.

02:47.448 --> 02:50.000
You know, it means a lot
that you took this time off

02:50.103 --> 02:52.793
to be with family,
after everything.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.620
Yeah, Mama, you know what? Uh...

- Hey.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.275
Just came to check in on you.

03:29.379 --> 03:31.172
Saw you struggling
a little bit at HQ.

03:31.275 --> 03:32.586
Yeah, well, uh, I'm,

03:32.689 --> 03:34.344
I'm working through it.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.275
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:36.379 --> 03:38.931
I just didn't want to be
a reason for that.

03:39.965 --> 03:41.827
Thank you for that.

03:43.068 --> 03:45.344
Trey, so many people

03:45.448 --> 03:47.275
are alive because of you.

03:47.379 --> 03:49.965
And seven people are also dead
because of me.

03:55.241 --> 03:56.931
Hey, what are you doing
right now?

03:57.034 --> 03:58.896
Do you want to get out of here?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.344
We don't have to talk about
our feelings the whole time.

04:01.448 --> 04:04.068
Yeah, maybe grab a beer?

04:05.241 --> 04:07.965
- Yeah.
- Let me, uh,
let me grab my coat.

04:08.068 --> 04:09.862
- Okay.
- All right.

04:11.586 --> 04:13.758
So appetizers are obvious
for tonight, but, uh,

04:13.862 --> 04:16.551
salad? What's the salad
we can make the biggest?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.413
Oh, oh! Hey, there she is!

04:20.517 --> 04:22.724
- Woman of the hour!
- Hey!

04:22.827 --> 04:24.275
- Hi.
- Hey. We didn't burn anything

04:24.379 --> 04:25.931
down while you were gone.

04:26.034 --> 04:27.241
Not that you didn't try.

04:27.344 --> 04:28.586
We don't have to,
like, rehash anything.

04:28.689 --> 04:29.586
Did you hear about
the party he threw?

04:29.689 --> 04:30.965
What?
Kiddos.

04:31.068 --> 04:32.551
Give her a minute.
They're just excited.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.103
- We all are.
- Oh!

04:34.206 --> 04:36.655
Well, I am, too, and I want
to hear about everything,

04:36.758 --> 04:38.551
but there's someone
that I want you to meet.

04:38.655 --> 04:40.896
She should be here soon.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.896
Okay.
- Oh, we should show you
the new menu.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.206
- Yes, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I want to see.

04:46.310 --> 04:47.620
Here. All right.

04:47.724 --> 04:49.413
Oh, my goodness.

04:49.517 --> 04:51.655
Now, listen. My Marantz don't
touch anything under 180 grams.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.413
And it's no <i>Sorry Mom,</i>

04:53.517 --> 04:56.551
but I'll get it,
as long as it's 180.

04:56.655 --> 04:58.758
All right?
I have nothing less than that.

04:58.862 --> 05:01.655
Wait, are you guys talking about
the new Destroy Boys album?

05:01.758 --> 05:03.103
- Yeah, you know 'em?
- Sure.

05:03.206 --> 05:04.931
Toured together last spring.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.517
Hey, you know there's
a sold-out show here tonight?

05:08.620 --> 05:10.379
But I'm actually doing
will-call sales

05:10.482 --> 05:12.206
for true music fans.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.482
If you have 20 bucks,
I can put you on the list.

05:14.586 --> 05:17.000
Unless, you know,
you want to risk being turned

05:17.103 --> 05:19.241
away at the door. You know,
don't want to be <i>that</i> guy.

05:19.344 --> 05:21.862
Thanks. Thanks.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.931
Got a name?

05:25.034 --> 05:26.517
Hey, Geri.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.620
- Welcome back.
- I missed you.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.448
Uh, also,

05:30.551 --> 05:32.517
does that girl work here?
Because she is

05:32.620 --> 05:34.517
selling tickets
to our fundraiser.

05:34.620 --> 05:36.724
Who is? Because we're,
we're not selling tickets.

05:36.827 --> 05:38.517
- Cordi!
- Sorry, my name is Sadie...

05:38.620 --> 05:40.068
- You guys look like some...
- Uh,

05:40.172 --> 05:42.655
excuse me, sorry. I-I heard
you were selling tickets

05:42.758 --> 05:45.862
to the fundraiser tonight?
The... free fundraiser.

05:45.965 --> 05:48.413
- No, Cordi, wait.
- I'm co-owner of this place.

05:48.517 --> 05:50.172
And a Texas Ranger. I'm sorry.

05:50.275 --> 05:52.413
- Are we gonna have
an issue here?
- Cordi. Wait. Just...

05:52.517 --> 05:54.413
No, this is
who I wanted you to meet.

05:54.517 --> 05:57.275
Her. Everyone.

05:57.379 --> 05:59.862
This is Sadie Yoo.

05:59.965 --> 06:01.827
Hoyt's daughter.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.137
Hoyt? Like-like, our Hoyt?

06:06.241 --> 06:08.000
Yep.
Your Hoyt.

06:08.103 --> 06:09.517
My dad.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.862
Pleasure to meet you.

06:13.275 --> 06:14.379
Hmm.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.620
Hold on, Hoyt had a kid?
Did he know about it?

06:25.724 --> 06:28.137
About her? Did you know?
Uh, uh, when did this happen?

06:28.241 --> 06:31.068
I don't know, one of the times
we were broken up? Listen.

06:31.172 --> 06:34.689
It's not like I had a tracker
on him when we weren't together.

06:34.793 --> 06:36.517
How did we not know about this?

06:36.620 --> 06:38.172
Because he didn't know.

06:38.275 --> 06:41.965
Sadie's mom, Melissa,
she never told him.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.275
Hey, get you something?

06:46.379 --> 06:47.827
Oh, not yet.
I'm meeting someone.

06:47.931 --> 06:49.931
Maybe.

06:50.034 --> 06:51.724
Everything all right?

06:53.448 --> 06:55.275
I don't know.

06:55.379 --> 06:57.965
There was this guy
a few years ago.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.413
Now my daughter has
all these questions

06:59.517 --> 07:01.000
about her dad
that I can't answer.

07:01.103 --> 07:04.344
He said he came here a lot, so...

07:04.448 --> 07:05.862
I don't know what I'm doing.

07:05.965 --> 07:07.862
I don't know
why I'm telling you all that.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.379
It's my job.

07:09.482 --> 07:11.172
Drink's on me.

07:11.275 --> 07:12.965
Whiskey?

07:13.068 --> 07:15.379
Yeah.

07:15.482 --> 07:18.137
Geraldine, my love!

07:19.482 --> 07:21.586
Oh, the angels themselves
have come down

07:21.689 --> 07:23.655
to Earth and blessed us.

07:23.758 --> 07:26.862
I can die happy,
just seeing that face.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.482
Ah!

07:30.827 --> 07:33.068
Why do you smell like acetylene?

07:33.172 --> 07:34.724
Better question...

07:34.827 --> 07:36.896
why do you know
what acetylene smells like?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.448
Because my dad used it to repair
gates at Davidson Ranch.

07:39.551 --> 07:42.206
But you're not working.

07:42.310 --> 07:44.620
Maybe I started a new job.

07:44.724 --> 07:46.965
A new job? What kind of job?

07:47.068 --> 07:48.344
Don't worry,

07:48.448 --> 07:49.896
I'm-I'm being smart.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.827
That's something people say
when they're thinking

07:51.931 --> 07:53.724
about doing something
really dumb.

07:53.827 --> 07:55.965
Just... hear me out.
It's just one time.

07:56.068 --> 07:57.758
That's the other thing
people say.

07:57.862 --> 07:59.758
Hoyt, it is one thing

07:59.862 --> 08:02.517
to flirt with trouble, but this,
this sounds like more.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.137
Don't.

08:04.241 --> 08:06.103
Look at me!

08:06.206 --> 08:07.310
Okay?

08:07.413 --> 08:08.827
I'm being serious.

08:08.931 --> 08:10.620
Sadie's mom didn't want her kid

08:10.724 --> 08:12.379
being raised by a criminal.

08:12.482 --> 08:14.689
How did Sadie find you, then?

08:14.793 --> 08:17.413
Well, her mother passed away
a couple months ago.

08:17.517 --> 08:19.103
Sadie was always curious,

08:19.206 --> 08:21.827
so she used one of those
DNA ancestry services.

08:21.931 --> 08:24.551
Hoyt's in the federal system.

08:24.655 --> 08:26.206
That made the connection,
led her to me.

08:26.310 --> 08:27.551
We don't think

08:27.655 --> 08:29.793
she's scamming you?

08:29.896 --> 08:31.379
Scamming me?

08:31.482 --> 08:34.206
What, like I'm some rich
old widow to siphon off of?

08:34.310 --> 08:37.172
Come on, Cordi, she's a kid.

08:37.275 --> 08:39.000
Newly orphaned, by the way.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.586
She needs to know where
she came from just like I did.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.517
And we were

08:43.620 --> 08:45.620
the people
that he was closest to.

08:45.724 --> 08:48.206
And, Cordi, she's his.

08:48.310 --> 08:51.206
Isn't that reason alone
to give her a chance?

08:53.862 --> 08:55.758
You have my number.
Think about it.

08:55.862 --> 08:57.620
We will, we will. Thank you.

08:57.724 --> 08:59.965
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Thanks.

09:00.827 --> 09:02.482
- Come on.
- Ah, you know,
the bathrooms need

09:02.586 --> 09:04.241
real, like, updating, so...

09:04.344 --> 09:05.965
We can do
all the updates you want to do

09:06.068 --> 09:07.275
with the pile of money
we're gonna save.

09:07.379 --> 09:09.793
You mean compared
to the brand-new condo

09:09.896 --> 09:11.310
downtown with
the heated bathroom floors

09:11.413 --> 09:12.862
- and the valet...
- Condo? Did you say "condo"?

09:12.965 --> 09:14.517
...park... Valet parking.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.862
Look at this, look at,
look, look...

09:15.965 --> 09:18.482
- at the bones on this bad boy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:18.586 --> 09:20.655
It's a classic. They don't make
houses like this anymore.

09:20.758 --> 09:22.862
Maybe for a reason.
I'm just saying.

09:22.965 --> 09:25.482
You say "classic," I hear "old."

09:25.586 --> 09:26.827
Oh, oh, okay.

09:26.931 --> 09:28.586
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm beginning to think

09:28.689 --> 09:31.034
- we're working off of
different checklists here.
- No, I...

09:31.137 --> 09:32.827
I'm just saying,
we have done the family house

09:32.931 --> 09:34.068
once before, okay?

09:34.172 --> 09:36.655
- This one is for us.
- I know.

09:36.758 --> 09:38.068
- It's...
- Okay, look.

09:38.172 --> 09:40.206
I have to go get the new offices
ready for Monday.

09:40.310 --> 09:41.413
We will figure this out.

09:41.517 --> 09:42.931
Okay?

09:43.034 --> 09:44.655
Okay.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.241
- Okay?
- All right.

09:46.344 --> 09:48.172
- Okay.
- Just, hey,
think about the Craftsman.

09:48.275 --> 09:49.310
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, baby?

09:49.413 --> 09:51.137
- Yep.
- The bones, baby.

09:51.241 --> 09:53.344
Think about them bones.

09:53.448 --> 09:55.620
Hopefully, this

09:55.724 --> 09:58.103
won't take long,
just let me talk to the guy.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.413
No lawyer stuff.

09:59.517 --> 10:02.000
People get sensitive
about wine forgery.

10:02.103 --> 10:04.620
Right. But can I talk at all?

10:04.724 --> 10:07.068
Yeah, of course.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.206
<i>I purchased</i>

10:10.310 --> 10:12.413
several cases
of a '91 Cab from you.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.448
But they're not right.

10:14.551 --> 10:17.103
Well, you likely
mishandled the wine.

10:17.206 --> 10:18.896
Look, I-I didn't buy it
for my book club.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.689
I work for one of the top
wine retailers in the state.

10:20.793 --> 10:22.724
I think what we received was,

10:22.827 --> 10:25.689
uh... not correct.

10:26.586 --> 10:29.862
So, what, you're, uh,
you're accusing me of forgery?

10:29.965 --> 10:32.034
No, he's not accusing you
of anything.

10:32.137 --> 10:34.379
But maybe you have
an authentication process

10:34.482 --> 10:36.896
- that you could show us?
- This is
absolutely preposterous.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.034
Whoa, hold on a minute,
that's an honest request.

10:39.137 --> 10:40.517
But if you're refusing,
it does make it

10:40.620 --> 10:42.034
- a little bit more complicated.
- Oh, oh.

10:42.137 --> 10:44.172
I see, so you're gonna
shake down a local grower?

10:44.275 --> 10:46.517
We can keep it simple, honestly.
Here, I think if you

10:46.620 --> 10:48.482
- take a look at this...
- We're done. I've seen enough.

10:48.586 --> 10:50.241
Get off the property.

10:53.793 --> 10:56.137
To be fair, that actually wasn't

10:56.241 --> 10:59.482
lawyer talk, that was just
overprotective boyfriend talk.

10:59.586 --> 11:01.724
Ben, wait.

11:06.827 --> 11:09.827
<i>♪ It's a little step
in the right direction...♪</i>

11:09.931 --> 11:11.758
So tell me how it's
been being a business owner.

11:11.862 --> 11:14.551
You know, um,
a lot of hard work.

11:14.655 --> 11:16.724
Some growing pains.

11:16.827 --> 11:18.793
But I'm really excited about it.

11:18.896 --> 11:21.448
Great, and it looks like

11:21.551 --> 11:23.137
you found your reason to be

11:23.241 --> 11:25.379
that weird alumni
who's always around.

11:25.482 --> 11:27.000
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.620
You have no idea how much
I regret saying that stuff.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.241
Oh, stop it, I'm kidding.

11:31.344 --> 11:33.448
I mean, I have to have
some fun with you about it.

11:33.551 --> 11:35.482
You know,

11:35.586 --> 11:37.275
sometimes things
don't make sense

11:37.379 --> 11:38.862
until you're
on the other side of them.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.586
Yeah. This whole thing
with the rescue,

11:41.689 --> 11:43.275
- it just felt right.
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.379 --> 11:45.620
And I guess Austin
is not the worst place

11:45.724 --> 11:47.206
- in the world to be stuck.
- No.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.965
And every choice you make,
it can evolve, you know?

11:50.068 --> 11:52.896
Something I'm still
trying to learn, anyway.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, I have to run
to the feed store.

11:55.103 --> 11:56.689
But I'll see you tonight, okay?

11:56.793 --> 11:58.655
Sounds good.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.379
Don't be mad, but I couldn't
just stand by.

12:03.482 --> 12:06.413
All right, cavalry's here.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.931
You called my sister?

12:08.034 --> 12:10.137
Cass, this doesn't need
to involve

12:10.241 --> 12:11.896
- law enforcement.
- No, you're in luck.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.517
We were off today. We were
on our way to get a beer,

12:13.620 --> 12:16.310
but wine will suffice.
Liam said that you think

12:16.413 --> 12:18.862
this winemaker sold you
some forged bottles?

12:18.965 --> 12:21.379
- That is what happened.
- Okay.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.241
All I know...

12:23.344 --> 12:26.137
is I opened this bottle,
and it didn't taste right.

12:26.241 --> 12:29.310
Said it was a '91,
but it was a 2010, tops.

12:29.413 --> 12:31.310
Anyway, I tried another

12:31.413 --> 12:33.275
and I noticed that
the label was different

12:33.379 --> 12:36.034
from similar vintages they put
out, like it wasn't a part

12:36.137 --> 12:38.000
of the original run.
This is a big claim

12:38.103 --> 12:39.827
that I don't know how to prove.

12:39.931 --> 12:42.034
I already accused him
of forgery.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.275
I don't know. If I'm wrong,

12:44.379 --> 12:46.413
it could ruin all
my relationships in Austin wine.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.068
Well, that's not gonna happen.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.137
Ben, you're, like,
a savant with alcohol.

12:50.241 --> 12:52.103
You say something's wrong,
I believe you.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.172
I don't want this
to come back on me.

12:54.275 --> 12:56.758
Of course not.
Get to your fundraiser.

12:57.758 --> 12:59.103
All right, thank you.

12:59.206 --> 13:01.482
Yeah. All right.
Thanks, bud.

13:02.965 --> 13:04.551
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:04.655 --> 13:06.896
Almost definitely not.

13:08.862 --> 13:11.068
August. Hey.

13:11.172 --> 13:13.448
- Come on, bud,
not in the living room.
- Sorry.

13:13.551 --> 13:15.379
I found Sadie's MusicCloud,
and she's like this...

13:15.482 --> 13:17.827
singer-songwriter.
She's actually really good.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.103
I kind of got, like, sucked in.

13:19.206 --> 13:21.103
That's interesting.
One might say

13:21.206 --> 13:23.551
there's more to her
than meets the eye.

13:24.931 --> 13:26.241
Oh! Geri!

13:26.344 --> 13:27.827
- Oh, so good to see you.
- There she is!

13:27.931 --> 13:29.827
- Hi!
- Hey, hey, we'd hug you, but...

13:29.931 --> 13:32.482
- you'd smell like
the stable, so... All right.
- Get in here, come on.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.793
- My goodness.
- Hey, hey.

13:35.896 --> 13:38.068
Um, do we think
it's a great idea

13:38.172 --> 13:39.896
for Sadie to come tonight?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.413
I mean, I just want
to be sure about her

13:41.517 --> 13:42.965
before bringing her
into the circle.

13:43.068 --> 13:44.965
- You know?
- Well, uh...

13:45.068 --> 13:47.241
I brought her in.
Do you trust me?

13:47.344 --> 13:49.379
And, let's be honest,

13:49.482 --> 13:52.758
before the Marines,
you and Hoyt did much worse

13:52.862 --> 13:54.655
- than sell fake tickets.
- Okay, all right.

13:54.758 --> 13:57.379
And, hey, look, if you don't
want to be a part of her life,

13:57.482 --> 13:58.793
you don't have to be,

13:58.896 --> 14:00.896
but it's my bar, too,
and she's coming.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.896
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.172
- I'll see you later.
- All righty.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.689
- Okay.
- See you later.
- Well...

14:07.793 --> 14:09.413
I got to say,

14:09.517 --> 14:11.000
I'm surprised
you don't even want to try

14:11.103 --> 14:12.344
to get to know Hoyt's daughter.

14:12.448 --> 14:13.793
I didn't say
I don't want to try, Mama,

14:13.896 --> 14:14.931
I'm just being cautious.

14:15.034 --> 14:17.034
I literally met the girl

14:17.137 --> 14:18.482
as she was stealing from me.

14:18.586 --> 14:20.172
Well, technically, she was

14:20.275 --> 14:22.103
stealing from those
hipster bros, just saying.

14:22.206 --> 14:24.172
Thank you, August.

14:24.275 --> 14:26.896
My point is,
she seems like trouble.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.793
Well, so did Hoyt, on occasion,

14:29.896 --> 14:31.655
and we loved him,
a hell of a lot.

14:31.758 --> 14:33.000
Me, I still would've hid

14:33.103 --> 14:34.793
my good bourbon
from that boy, though.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.034
But if I had the chance
to do it all over again,

14:38.137 --> 14:40.068
I believe that I would've been
kinder to Hoyt.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.965
Better that than regrets.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.413
Maybe that's part of it, too.
Regrets. You know?

14:45.517 --> 14:47.310
It's not like Hoyt
was born a criminal.

14:47.413 --> 14:49.965
And the first time
he ever got in real trouble,

14:50.068 --> 14:52.862
I could've stepped in.
I should've.

14:54.586 --> 14:57.034
So, this is it.

14:57.137 --> 14:58.896
Mm, excuse us, ma'am.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.068
Cordell.
Hey. Uh...

15:02.172 --> 15:04.793
Y'all, meet my new partner,
Larry James.

15:04.896 --> 15:06.206
Larry, my best friends

15:06.310 --> 15:08.241
Hoyt Rawlins
and Geraldine Broussard.

15:08.344 --> 15:09.517
- How's it going?
- Hey.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.931
- Just Geri's fine.
- Oh, just Larry

15:12.034 --> 15:13.620
is fine. Good to meet you.

15:13.724 --> 15:15.137
- Introducing us
to your new partner.
- Yeah.

15:15.241 --> 15:16.172
This calls for celebration.

15:16.275 --> 15:17.931
All right.

15:18.034 --> 15:20.103
This is for you, handsome.

15:20.206 --> 15:22.931
All right, boys,
what's it gonna be?

15:23.034 --> 15:26.068
Uh, club soda is fine.

15:26.172 --> 15:27.896
Mm, okay, don't shoot.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.793
- Two club sodas, please.
- Lame.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.517
Double tequila in mine, then.

15:33.068 --> 15:35.413
So, how's our Cordi faring?
Oh, good.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.172
- I'd say he's a natural.
- Well, color me

15:38.275 --> 15:40.655
surprised,
considering all the trouble

15:40.758 --> 15:43.068
- we used to get in.
- Really?

15:43.172 --> 15:44.896
Yeah.

15:46.724 --> 15:49.586
So, how about you, Hoyt,
you still getting in trouble?

15:49.689 --> 15:51.689
Me? No. No, sir.

15:51.793 --> 15:54.413
Eh, the very thought of
disappointing Geraldine on that

15:54.517 --> 15:55.827
keeps me in line.

15:55.931 --> 15:58.482
Mm. Anyway,

15:58.586 --> 16:00.000
I should be on my way.

16:00.103 --> 16:01.689
Got to handle
some personal matters.

16:01.793 --> 16:02.793
- Yeah.
- Ranger James,

16:02.896 --> 16:04.000
a pleasure. Darlin',

16:04.103 --> 16:05.137
I'll see you tonight.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.379
He said he's gonna
"color outside the lines."

16:14.482 --> 16:16.379
Could you go talk
to him, please?

16:16.482 --> 16:18.172
I'm sure it's just
Hoyt being Hoyt.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.827
Look,
I don't know what you mean by

16:19.931 --> 16:21.172
coloring outside the lines,

16:21.275 --> 16:22.689
but your boy is definitely
being shady.

16:22.793 --> 16:26.137
Okay, okay.

16:28.034 --> 16:29.689
Hoyt, hey. Hey, hey.

16:29.793 --> 16:31.655
Wait up, wait up. Just, uh...

16:31.758 --> 16:34.000
Just...

16:36.310 --> 16:38.137
Just tell me how-how
worried I should be.

16:38.241 --> 16:40.000
Not at all, C Dubs.

16:40.103 --> 16:42.103
Okay. I know that look.

16:42.206 --> 16:44.551
I know you probably
feel like-like you can't

16:44.655 --> 16:47.689
tell me about stuff...

16:47.793 --> 16:50.724
...the way you used to,
but if I can help...

16:50.827 --> 16:53.827
It's not something
you can help me with,

16:53.931 --> 16:55.482
and I don't want to lie to you.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.482
So let's leave it at that.

16:58.586 --> 17:00.172
All right?

17:01.103 --> 17:02.965
Just never could tell

17:03.068 --> 17:05.413
if I was making the right call
with Hoyt, you know?

17:05.517 --> 17:07.655
Well, I do know that your heart
was always in the right place.

17:07.758 --> 17:09.379
There's a fine line
between giving someone

17:09.482 --> 17:12.724
the benefit of the doubt
and enabling them.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.310
Right.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.620
All right.

17:23.724 --> 17:25.310
So what are you
actually thinking?

17:25.413 --> 17:27.655
Can you improvise?

17:27.758 --> 17:30.586
I once convinced a terrorist
organization I was one of them.

17:30.689 --> 17:31.862
Fair.

17:33.068 --> 17:35.413
Isn't it delicious?
If you swish it around

17:35.517 --> 17:37.000
on your palate,
you'll start to recognize

17:37.103 --> 17:38.862
several different layers.

17:38.965 --> 17:41.103
The land in Austin makes this
one of our most

17:41.206 --> 17:43.000
popular varietals.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.586
Perfect for a Tempranillo.
Oh, we have new guests.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.793
Sandra Friciello, and my, uh,
partner and chef...

17:50.620 --> 17:53.586
- Thomas Alexandre.
- Mm. [gasps] Oh.

17:56.344 --> 17:58.724
<i>Saluti,</i> everyone.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.724
<i>- Salud.</i>
- Mm.

18:00.827 --> 18:03.241
Mm.

18:03.344 --> 18:04.793
- It's wonderful. Mmm.
- Ooh.

18:04.896 --> 18:07.413
But do you have anything
more unique or rare?

18:07.517 --> 18:09.620
Yes.
- I-I can help you with that.

18:09.724 --> 18:12.793
We have been renowned
for our wines

18:12.896 --> 18:14.068
going back decades.

18:14.172 --> 18:15.724
That's what we've been told,

18:15.827 --> 18:17.586
but we need to see
for ourselves.

18:17.689 --> 18:21.000
Yes, yes, and if it's good,
money is absolutely no issue.

18:21.103 --> 18:22.482
Mm.

18:22.586 --> 18:24.827
Well, I think I may have
something perfect for you.

18:24.931 --> 18:26.137
Let me check our reserve.

18:26.241 --> 18:28.448
Thank you.

18:29.517 --> 18:31.034
Here.

18:31.137 --> 18:32.896
- I'm gonna go check out
what he's doing.
- All right.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.758
Excuse me, where's the restroom?

18:34.862 --> 18:36.862
Oh. It's just down the hall
over there.

18:36.965 --> 18:38.517
So, what notes are we tasting?

18:38.620 --> 18:41.379
Vanilla. Cherry.

18:53.344 --> 18:56.172

Jackpot.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.448
Oh, Sandra.

20:14.551 --> 20:17.827
Our sommelier just
introduced me to a Sangiovese

20:17.931 --> 20:19.275
which would pair-- mwah--

20:19.379 --> 20:20.965
fantastic with
our poulet aux noix.

20:21.068 --> 20:24.413
Ah, fantastic, because that
has been keeping me up at night.

20:24.517 --> 20:26.896
Can I talk to you a moment?
Over here?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.551
Of course.

20:31.137 --> 20:33.620
Did you find anything?

20:35.448 --> 20:37.068
Good news, I was able

20:37.172 --> 20:40.344
to set aside three cases at
$3,000 each, but I'll need time

20:40.448 --> 20:42.344
- to secure more.
- Oh, is secure the word?

20:42.448 --> 20:45.310
- Or is it forge?
- What are these?

20:46.241 --> 20:47.896
There's an explanation.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.551
Looks like freshly
printed labels to me.

20:50.655 --> 20:52.620
Right, so then why
do they say "1991"?

20:52.724 --> 20:54.068
Why, indeed?

20:54.172 --> 20:55.379
I wonder what else
we might find.

20:55.482 --> 20:56.655
Mm.

20:56.758 --> 20:58.620
Listen, it's simple, really.
I just...

20:58.724 --> 21:00.655
Ah, you're gonna want to choose
your next few words

21:00.758 --> 21:03.827
- very carefully.
- We're Texas Rangers,
by the way.

21:07.586 --> 21:09.655
I did it to make up
the difference

21:09.758 --> 21:11.862
after successive bad seasons.

21:11.965 --> 21:13.896
I didn't know how to tell
my business partner.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
It was just gonna be
a couple of cases. Right.

21:17.103 --> 21:18.724
Well, we're gonna need you
to refund the money

21:18.827 --> 21:20.586
to Ben Perez and
everyone else you owe.

21:20.689 --> 21:22.896
We'll have someone here
within the week

21:23.000 --> 21:25.724
to check in on that.
Understood?

21:25.827 --> 21:28.000
Yeah.

21:28.103 --> 21:30.206
What do I tell my partner?

21:32.275 --> 21:34.448
Listen, man,

21:34.551 --> 21:36.793
you just gotta have
a little bit of faith.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.068
The thing about partners is
they tend to have your back

21:40.172 --> 21:43.206
when you need it the most.

21:53.586 --> 21:55.034
<i>Thank you so much for coming.</i>

21:55.137 --> 21:57.275
Thank you for donating.
How you doing?

21:57.379 --> 21:58.862

- Hey, August, right?
- Yeah.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.448
Um, do you know what music
Hoyt liked?

22:21.551 --> 22:23.655
I figured you'd be
the one to know.

22:23.758 --> 22:26.034
He, uh...

22:26.137 --> 22:27.689
I always feel like
Uncle Hoyt was, like, blasting

22:27.793 --> 22:29.758
Fleetwood Mac,
or something like that.

22:29.862 --> 22:32.551
By the way, I came across
your song, "Catch Me First."

22:32.655 --> 22:34.206
It's, like--
It's, like, really cool.

22:34.310 --> 22:36.344
"Came across" my song? Huh.

22:36.448 --> 22:38.965
I mean, it was right there.

22:39.068 --> 22:41.241
- I couldn't not click on it,
you know?
- It was right there?

22:41.344 --> 22:43.137
- Yeah, it was right there.
- So everyone has SoundCloud
nowadays?

22:43.241 --> 22:45.137
- I do. Do you?
- Oh, okay.

22:45.241 --> 22:47.551
Hey.
- Hey.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.827
Everything all right?

22:49.931 --> 22:53.000
You look a little more ponderous
than usual.

22:53.103 --> 22:54.689
Do I?

22:54.793 --> 22:56.344
Mm.

22:56.448 --> 22:59.689
Um, well...

23:02.551 --> 23:04.655
There is this.

23:06.413 --> 23:07.586
Wow. That's gorgeous.

23:07.689 --> 23:09.000
It's my grandmother's diamond.

23:09.103 --> 23:11.551
She passed recently.
We were pretty tight.

23:11.655 --> 23:13.862
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

23:14.965 --> 23:17.655
She gave me constant hell
when Kelly and I got divorced.

23:17.758 --> 23:19.413
Larry, you're messing up.

23:22.620 --> 23:25.344
Anyway, first time around
I just bought a ring

23:25.448 --> 23:26.724
at some store.
Second time around,

23:26.827 --> 23:28.620
it feels like I should,
you know,

23:28.724 --> 23:30.068
do something
a little more special.

23:30.172 --> 23:32.379
Second time?

23:32.482 --> 23:35.137
You asking, Larry?
That's beautiful.

23:35.241 --> 23:37.034
That's the plan.

23:37.137 --> 23:38.551
I mean, I-I-I want to.

23:38.655 --> 23:40.034
We've been looking
at houses together.

23:40.137 --> 23:43.586
There's this Craftsman
that I... love.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.517
- Yeah?
- Kelly doesn't want
an old house,

23:45.620 --> 23:47.482
- so... I don't know.
- Oh.

23:47.586 --> 23:48.965
Kind of makes me worried
that she might not want

23:49.068 --> 23:50.931
a secondhand ring,

23:51.034 --> 23:54.655
or a secondhand husband,
for that matter.

23:55.758 --> 23:58.344
That woman loves you.

23:58.448 --> 23:59.689
And you've put in the work.

23:59.793 --> 24:02.206
You're on the other side
of it now.

24:02.310 --> 24:05.206
But if you want, you could
get that stone reset.

24:05.310 --> 24:08.931
Same ring, but different.

24:09.034 --> 24:10.896
Huh.

24:14.379 --> 24:16.206
- What's going on?
- Hey, come here.

24:16.310 --> 24:17.689
Look at that. See that?

24:17.793 --> 24:20.310
Is she flirting with Augie?

24:20.413 --> 24:22.482
Aw, geez, call for backup.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.586
Are young people
charming each other

24:24.689 --> 24:26.275
- in this fine establishment?
- All right,

24:26.379 --> 24:28.413
Geri, I'm trying to give Sadie

24:28.517 --> 24:30.034
the benefit of the doubt, I am.

24:30.137 --> 24:34.137
But that kid comes
pre-programmed with a lot.

24:34.241 --> 24:36.931
I know, but hear me out.

24:37.034 --> 24:39.482
Do you think maybe
you're being hard on her

24:39.586 --> 24:41.034
because you were
too soft on Hoyt?

24:42.379 --> 24:44.448
- Hey, Geri.
- Hey.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.586
Walker, uh, didn't you have to
talk to Sadie about something?

24:50.827 --> 24:53.275
- Wow, she really just did that.
- Yeah, yeah, she did.

24:53.379 --> 24:57.172
Well... I'll start.

24:57.275 --> 25:00.482
We got off on the wrong foot.

25:01.379 --> 25:02.793
Ranger Cordell Walker.

25:02.896 --> 25:05.758
Bastard Orphan Sadie.

25:05.862 --> 25:09.137
Wow. Uh...

25:09.241 --> 25:11.724
...you, uh...

25:11.827 --> 25:14.068
Your dad used to do that.

25:15.793 --> 25:18.655
Hey, can we be, uh, real
for just a second?

25:20.137 --> 25:21.551
Sure.

25:21.655 --> 25:23.000
There's something
I wanted to know.

25:23.103 --> 25:26.862
Um, did Hoyt,

25:26.965 --> 25:28.241
uh...

25:28.344 --> 25:31.206
ever mention
if he knew about me to you?

25:34.586 --> 25:37.379
You know, Hoyt wasn't perfect,

25:37.482 --> 25:39.310
but he had a good heart.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.068
The best.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.793
Um...

25:42.896 --> 25:45.000
If he knew about you,

25:45.103 --> 25:46.689
he'd have done
everything possible

25:46.793 --> 25:48.620
to be a part of your life.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.758
Geri went out on a limb for you.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.689
Wants me to do the same.
But what you did--

26:02.793 --> 26:04.965
selling fake tickets
to a concert--

26:05.068 --> 26:06.448
you're gonna have
to earn my trust.

26:06.551 --> 26:08.517
I know.

26:08.620 --> 26:09.931
I mean, but there were circumstances...

26:10.034 --> 26:12.172
Circumstances? Okay.
I've heard this before

26:12.275 --> 26:15.413
with the circumstances;
Hoyt was great with excuses.

26:15.517 --> 26:18.620
See that money in that boot?
That's for charity.

26:18.724 --> 26:21.931
So if anything happens to it,
I'm holding you accountable.

26:22.034 --> 26:24.379
Think I'd steal
from a charity?

26:24.482 --> 26:26.551
I think that's what you were
doing when we met,

26:26.655 --> 26:28.137
as a matter of fact. Sadie.

26:28.241 --> 26:29.793
- Can I borrow you really quick?
- Augie, one second.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.413
It's really important.
Hey, listen, our opener

26:31.517 --> 26:33.793
is stuck in San Antonio,
and, like, the crowd is

26:33.896 --> 26:35.310
getting just restless,
so I was wondering

26:35.413 --> 26:38.862
if you could, like,
play to pass the time?

26:38.965 --> 26:41.620
I don't have my band.

26:43.241 --> 26:44.310
Do you have a loop pedal?

26:44.413 --> 26:47.310
Yes. Yes. Oh, my God,
thank you.

26:47.413 --> 26:49.551
Sorry.

26:50.862 --> 26:52.482
Okay, well, thank you anyway.

26:52.586 --> 26:54.862
Hey, Stella, uh,
Sadie's gonna fill in

26:54.965 --> 26:57.000
- before the next band gets here.
- Sadie, you're a lifesaver.

26:57.103 --> 26:59.034
Hey, no worries.
Got me away from your dad.

26:59.137 --> 27:02.068
Dude's got no chill.
No offense.

27:02.172 --> 27:05.000
- It's because he cares.
- Mm-hmm.

27:06.586 --> 27:08.586
I'm sorry about your mom,

27:08.689 --> 27:11.689
but I'm really happy that
we're getting to meet you now.

27:11.793 --> 27:13.620
Same.

27:14.413 --> 27:18.034
Hey, Augie, can I airdrop you
my backing tracks?

27:18.137 --> 27:19.620
I am gonna try your suggestion

27:19.724 --> 27:20.862
- for my single.
- Yeah.

27:20.965 --> 27:22.862
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

27:24.275 --> 27:25.206
Oh, uh, by the way,

27:25.310 --> 27:26.655
Uncle Hoyt's not
my actual uncle.

27:26.758 --> 27:28.103
Just in case you thought
we were related.

27:28.206 --> 27:29.655
We're-we're definitely
not related.

27:29.758 --> 27:31.068
Augie?
- Yeah?

27:31.172 --> 27:32.862
Just give her the guitar.

27:32.965 --> 27:34.827
Thanks.

27:37.172 --> 27:40.344
Hello. We just want to say
thank you so much

27:40.448 --> 27:43.310

27:54.758 --> 27:59.068

Geri, where's Sadie?

30:53.827 --> 30:56.068
I... I don't know.

30:56.965 --> 30:58.482
Geri...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.827
Sadie robbed us.

31:13.827 --> 31:16.344
Hey. Is everything all right?

31:17.965 --> 31:19.965
I got my money back
for the wine.

31:21.827 --> 31:23.310
You don't seem that relieved.

31:24.862 --> 31:26.172
Okay.

31:27.172 --> 31:28.827
When I said I wanted
to handle things today,

31:28.931 --> 31:30.068
I meant it.

31:30.172 --> 31:32.379
Look, I take a lot of pride
in this.

31:32.482 --> 31:33.931
You know?
Building up my business.

31:34.034 --> 31:36.758
And then you kind of
inserted yourself.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.517
Well, you're right, I...

31:40.655 --> 31:42.137
I've just been so
in my head lately

31:42.241 --> 31:45.137
trying to start my own thing
that I...

31:45.241 --> 31:47.965
I guess I'm sort of trying
to be a fixer everywhere,

31:48.068 --> 31:50.517
and it is not working.

31:53.068 --> 31:55.965
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

31:57.448 --> 32:01.241
Side note.
Did any part of you like

32:01.344 --> 32:03.827
the protective boyfriend thing?

32:03.931 --> 32:05.413
Like, just...
like, a little bit.

32:08.241 --> 32:10.896
Mm, to discuss.

32:12.896 --> 32:15.000
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Augie.

32:15.103 --> 32:17.034
What a day. Um...

32:17.137 --> 32:20.482
- Oof.
- Wait. What...

32:20.586 --> 32:23.310
How... How did you...
It's all there.

32:25.689 --> 32:26.862
Hi.

32:26.965 --> 32:29.241
I'm gonna let you two talk.

32:29.344 --> 32:31.758
By the way,
you-you killed it tonight.

32:31.862 --> 32:33.758
Except for the little
boot heist over there.

32:33.862 --> 32:38.137
Yeah. Well, thanks for
making me sound good.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.586
Yeah, okay.

32:44.689 --> 32:47.827
You know, you were so sure
that I'd steal that money,

32:47.931 --> 32:51.655
I figured, why waste energy
trying to prove you wrong?

32:53.172 --> 32:55.137
But then, uh,
halfway to Dallas

32:55.241 --> 32:56.482
the fun kinda went
out of it, so...

32:56.586 --> 32:59.379
You know, Sadie,
I kinda get the feeling

32:59.482 --> 33:02.586
that none of this has been
about the fun for you,

33:02.689 --> 33:04.517
given everything
you've been through.

33:04.620 --> 33:06.551
No.

33:10.586 --> 33:13.482
I'm not just some
down-and-out kid,

33:13.586 --> 33:15.172
just so you know.

33:15.275 --> 33:18.344
My mom and I, we were good.

33:18.448 --> 33:21.448
But, uh, you know,
she got sick,

33:21.551 --> 33:24.172
and I just started having
all these questions.

33:24.275 --> 33:26.965
And that is why I'm here.

33:27.068 --> 33:30.586
I get that.
You know, my job

33:30.689 --> 33:34.827
and my life, I guess,

33:34.931 --> 33:36.758
have kind of conditioned me

33:36.862 --> 33:38.413
to assume the worst.

33:38.517 --> 33:42.068
And tonight,
you did the right thing

33:42.172 --> 33:44.448
in the end.

33:44.551 --> 33:46.551
Not always what
your daddy would have done.

33:46.655 --> 33:48.482
Yeah, well,

33:48.586 --> 33:50.206
this might be a hell
of a reveal,

33:50.310 --> 33:54.517
but, um, I'm not actually him.

33:55.862 --> 33:59.241
I know, but...

33:59.344 --> 34:03.137
you do stir up a lot
of familiar emotions

34:03.241 --> 34:05.344
for all of us.

34:08.137 --> 34:11.103
There was a guy
at the bar tonight.

34:12.379 --> 34:13.793
Yeah, that one.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.034
Just-just tell me
how worried I should be.

34:18.137 --> 34:20.931
Just a guy I owe money to.

34:21.034 --> 34:22.344
I'll figure it out.

34:22.448 --> 34:25.310
Okay, well, here's somewhere
I could help you.

34:27.241 --> 34:29.724
Okay. I mean,
do you have to, like,

34:29.827 --> 34:34.068
go all hard-ass Ranger
right off the bat?

34:34.172 --> 34:37.793
Can I just get, like,
like five minutes

34:37.896 --> 34:39.482
of Dad's best friend?

34:39.586 --> 34:44.551
<i>♪ High crimes, the race,
the game, the lie...♪</i>

34:44.655 --> 34:47.137
I'd like that.

34:47.241 --> 34:49.310
I-I'd like the chance
to do both.

34:51.517 --> 34:54.758
Maybe you and I can agree
to give each other

34:54.862 --> 34:56.827
the benefit of the doubt.

34:56.931 --> 35:01.827
<i>♪ When we live,

35:01.931 --> 35:04.137
Geez, so serious.

35:05.827 --> 35:10.137
But yeah.
Yeah, I can agree to the terms.

35:10.241 --> 35:13.517
All right.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.482
Hello.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.827
- Hey.
- So, Thomas,

35:32.931 --> 35:35.137
do you think we should
join a wine club, or--

35:35.241 --> 35:36.862
Not the place that
we just went to,

35:36.965 --> 35:38.310
but...

35:38.413 --> 35:39.896
Sorry, were you in the middle
of something?

35:40.000 --> 35:43.586
Uh, I've just been trying
to work up the nerve

35:43.689 --> 35:44.896
to call Lana back.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.241
Oh. Shoot.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.965
- Yeah.
- Well, I could come back later.

35:48.068 --> 35:49.758
Or you can make
the phone call

35:49.862 --> 35:51.862
and I can pour us
a glass of whiskey.

35:51.965 --> 35:53.310
- I like that.
- Great.

35:53.413 --> 35:55.344
Kind of partial to
one in a purple bag.

35:55.448 --> 35:59.137
Boom. Read my mind.

35:59.241 --> 36:00.413
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.

36:00.517 --> 36:01.724
That's what I'm talking about.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.620
All right,
I'll be right back. Uh...

36:03.724 --> 36:05.068
You know where the glasses are.

36:12.965 --> 36:14.724
<i>This is Lana, leave a message.</i>

36:14.827 --> 36:17.103
Hey, Lana, um,
sorry I missed you.

36:17.206 --> 36:18.827
Uh...

36:18.931 --> 36:21.172
I'd love it
if you would call me back.

36:21.275 --> 36:23.344
I, uh...

36:23.448 --> 36:27.379
I'm sorry I've been
hard to reach, but I've...

36:27.482 --> 36:29.620
I've been in a dark place.

36:29.724 --> 36:32.206
But I've...

36:33.068 --> 36:34.586
I've had some help.

36:36.758 --> 36:38.931
Uh, I'll-I'll talk to you soon.

36:39.034 --> 36:40.448
Yeah.

36:44.379 --> 36:46.068
All right, so what did you want
to check out?

36:46.172 --> 36:49.862
And do not tease me with
these heated bathroom floors.

36:49.965 --> 36:51.827
All right, this one
has got similar...

36:51.931 --> 36:53.724
Uh-uh! Don't...
don't say "bones."

36:53.827 --> 36:57.965
...bones to the Craftsman
that we looked at before.

36:58.068 --> 37:01.103
But they've already done
all the work to fix it up.

37:01.206 --> 37:02.586
I think it's kind of like

37:02.689 --> 37:05.137
the work we've been doing on us.

37:05.241 --> 37:06.724
You know?

37:06.827 --> 37:09.275
It can be exhausting sometimes,
can be frustrating.

37:09.379 --> 37:10.724
Mm-hmm.

37:10.827 --> 37:13.758
But in the end,
when it's all done, just...

37:13.862 --> 37:15.586
look at the result.

37:18.034 --> 37:20.965
You are waxing
very poetic right now.

37:21.068 --> 37:22.965
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

37:23.068 --> 37:25.655
it's an investment, right?
In us, in our future.

37:25.758 --> 37:29.551
In this-this new life
that we want for ourselves.

37:29.655 --> 37:32.137
The first time we got married,

37:32.241 --> 37:34.931
all I knew is that
I loved you.

37:35.758 --> 37:38.862
But I let things get
in the way of that.

37:38.965 --> 37:42.689
This time, I don't know,
it's brighter,

37:42.793 --> 37:45.517
it's sharper, it's... more.

37:45.620 --> 37:49.275
The, um, the first time
we were married?

37:59.620 --> 38:01.827
- Kelly...
- Yeah?

38:02.655 --> 38:06.137
...will you marry me... again?

38:08.172 --> 38:11.655
Yes. Yes. Yes.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.862
So, Sadie told me
about last night.

38:16.965 --> 38:18.793
Yeah, yeah.

38:18.896 --> 38:22.172
Um, I-I brought her
something, actually.

38:22.275 --> 38:24.931
A little memento
of our agreement.

38:27.689 --> 38:30.068
- Ah.
- Voilà.
Thought she might like it.

38:30.172 --> 38:32.482
- You want coffee?
- Uh, please.

38:34.689 --> 38:36.896
Geri, you were right.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.517
Say that again.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.758
You were right.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.275
Mm-hmm.

38:43.068 --> 38:44.689
I should have given
Sadie a chance.

38:44.793 --> 38:47.000
- You had to process.
- Yeah.

38:47.103 --> 38:48.724
I sure as hell did.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.827
Yeah, yeah, uh,
meeting Hoyt's child.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.655
Never thought
we'd see the day, huh?

38:56.758 --> 38:59.206
Well, never imagined it
like this.

38:59.310 --> 39:01.172
Yeah.

39:01.275 --> 39:05.931
Well, I tried to never really
let my head go there.

39:06.034 --> 39:10.103
Never really knew
how much to wish for with him.

39:10.206 --> 39:12.931
You know, with Sadie, um,

39:13.034 --> 39:17.034
I keep thinking about how
I handled things with Hoyt.

39:17.137 --> 39:20.448
And I-I-I keep thinking
about that night,

39:20.551 --> 39:23.103
that first night
he got arrested.

39:24.137 --> 39:25.586
I mean, it wasn't like

39:25.689 --> 39:27.413
it was some
magical turning point, Cordi.

39:27.517 --> 39:28.758
I know that, but

39:28.862 --> 39:30.310
that night,

39:30.413 --> 39:32.275
behind all the bad choices,

39:32.379 --> 39:36.034
or roads not taken,
whatever you want to call it,

39:36.137 --> 39:39.689
Hoyt had wishes in him.

39:41.551 --> 39:43.724
More than we gave him
credit for.

39:50.241 --> 39:52.241
Cordell!

39:52.344 --> 39:53.344
Geri, hey...

39:53.448 --> 39:54.275
You could have stopped him when

39:54.379 --> 39:55.344
he wouldn't listen to me.

39:55.448 --> 39:56.931
But you chickened out,

39:57.034 --> 39:59.586
and now he's
an actual criminal, Cordi.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.448
Geri, maybe you should come back

40:01.551 --> 40:03.655
in the morning.

40:13.275 --> 40:16.827
I know, I screwed up.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.862
I'll listen to you
in the future.

40:19.965 --> 40:22.344
Do you actually see
a future with me?

40:22.448 --> 40:24.931
And I am asking for real,
Hoyt Rawlins.

40:26.275 --> 40:29.310
Because you pull crap like this,
and it makes me think you don't.

40:29.413 --> 40:30.965
I do.

40:31.068 --> 40:34.275
I wish I could
make you understand how I do.

40:34.379 --> 40:36.827
Me, too.

40:38.448 --> 40:39.448
Guess I'll see you
at the arraignment.

40:39.551 --> 40:42.344
Geri, wait.

Don't. She's right.

40:54.482 --> 40:58.655
She doesn't know,
but not a day goes by

40:58.758 --> 41:02.137
without me trying to make myself
more than this.

41:05.482 --> 41:09.793

he wasn't gonna get out
