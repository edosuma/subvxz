09:57.200 --> 10:00.300
SAY -- I LEARNED A NEW WORD,

10:00.366 --> 10:02.100
RETRO SESSION.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.066
PUT IT BACK FROM WHENCE IT CAME

10:04.133 --> 10:05.700
WHICH WAS MARYLAND, TO CREATE A

10:05.766 --> 10:07.500
CAPITAL THEY TOOK A CHUNK OUT OF

10:07.566 --> 10:09.500
VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND, RIGHT?

10:09.566 --> 10:12.633
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THAT?

10:12.700 --> 10:16.966
AND THEY WOULD BE REPRESENTED

10:17.033 --> 10:17.833
AND NOBODY LIVES IN THE AREA

10:17.900 --> 10:18.866
THAT THE PEOPLE WORK IN, NOBODY

10:18.933 --> 10:23.066
LIVES AT THE CAPITAL.

10:23.133 --> 10:25.100
SPEAK OF THE TWO SQUARE MILE

10:25.166 --> 10:26.333
AREA FOR THE CAPITAL, THERE'S

10:26.400 --> 10:27.733
VERY FEW PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE

10:27.800 --> 10:29.033
BUT MARYLAND WOULD HAVE TO AGREE

10:29.100 --> 10:29.933
WITH IT.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.333
IN THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE

10:31.400 --> 10:31.933
LEGISLATURE OF MARYLAND WOULD

10:32.000 --> 10:33.866
HAVE TO AGREE TO TAKE THAT 66

10:33.933 --> 10:35.166
SQUARE MILES AND 700,000

10:35.233 --> 10:37.200
RESIDENTS BACK AND THEY SAID

10:37.266 --> 10:38.533
THEY DON'T WANT THAT.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.366
>> Bill: WHAT ABOUT

10:40.433 --> 10:41.100
PUERTO RICO?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.066
>> SUPPORT FOR D.C. STATEHOOD

10:43.133 --> 10:46.366
AMONG PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN D.C. IS

10:46.433 --> 10:48.766
LIKE 85%, THEY DID.

10:48.833 --> 10:49.600
PUERTO RICO IS CLOSER DIVIDED,

10:49.666 --> 10:51.733
IT'S A BARE MAJORITY.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.400
>> Bill: OF THE PEOPLE THERE

10:52.466 --> 10:56.733
WHO WANT THAT?

10:56.800 --> 10:57.700
DESCRIBE THEIR STATUS NOW

10:57.766 --> 10:59.666
BECAUSE AMERICA WAS AN EMPIRE,

10:59.733 --> 11:00.900
SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT STILL

11:00.966 --> 11:01.933
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TERRITORY

11:02.000 --> 11:04.466
WHICH IS A WEIRD THING TO HAVE.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.333
WHEN YOU OWN TERRITORY, YOU KIND

11:06.400 --> 11:07.866
OF OWN THE PEOPLE.

11:07.933 --> 11:09.933
EITHER MAKE THEM CITIZENS OR LET

11:10.000 --> 11:11.966
THEM BE THEIR OWN CITIZENS OF

11:12.033 --> 11:12.966
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:13.033 --> 11:15.766
>> IT'S INCREDIBLY FUCKED UP AND

11:15.833 --> 11:17.833
IT PLAYS INTO THE LONG

11:17.900 --> 11:18.200
HISTORY --

11:18.266 --> 11:19.400
>> Bill: IT'S VERY

11:19.466 --> 11:19.733
ANACHRONISTIC.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.166
>> YOU HAVE FOUR AND A HALF

11:21.233 --> 11:23.366
MILLION PEOPLE WHO PAY TAXES AND

11:23.433 --> 11:24.766
THEY PARTICIPATE, THEY JOIN THE

11:24.833 --> 11:25.733
MILITARY BUT THEY DON'T GET

11:25.800 --> 11:26.933
REPRESENTATIVES.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.333
>> Bill: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

11:28.400 --> 11:29.633
NOT JUST PUERTO RICO.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.700
>> GUAM, THE VIRGIN ISLANDS,

11:32.766 --> 11:34.133
AMERICAN SAMOA, THE NORTHERN

11:34.200 --> 11:34.500
MARIANA ISLANDS.

11:34.566 --> 11:39.366
>> Bill: WHY DO WE HAVE GUAM?

11:39.433 --> 11:41.266
IT SEEMS NOT WOKE, WHERE ARE THE

11:41.333 --> 11:45.900
LOCAL PEOPLE ON THIS?

11:45.966 --> 11:48.566
>> AFTER PUERTO RICO, THAT'S THE

11:48.633 --> 11:50.866
NEXT MOST POPULATED TERRITORY.

11:50.933 --> 11:51.466
>> Bill: PUERTO RICO, THEY ARE

11:51.533 --> 11:59.633
CITIZENS AS WE KNOW.

11:59.700 --> 12:00.266
>> THIS ABOUT 3.3 MILLION

12:00.333 --> 12:00.533
CITIZENS.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.100
>> Bill: IT'S ODD TO ME YOU

12:01.166 --> 12:01.666
CAN BE CITIZENS AND NOT BE

12:01.733 --> 12:02.033
ESTATE ALREADY.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.233
>> A LOT OF THE STATES THAT WE

12:03.300 --> 12:06.200
HAVE BEGAN AS TERRITORIES WITHIN

12:06.266 --> 12:07.700
THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES

12:07.766 --> 12:09.233
BUT PUERTO RICO -- THEY'VE HAD A

12:09.300 --> 12:09.900
REFERENDUM SIX TIMES IN THE LAST

12:09.966 --> 12:11.666
FEW TIMES THEY'VE HAD A BARE

12:11.733 --> 12:12.633
MAJORITY FOR STATEHOOD.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.866
THE MOST CONVINCING ONE WAS THE

12:14.933 --> 12:15.500
PAST YEAR.

12:15.566 --> 12:17.733
>> Bill: WHAT IS THAT IN HUMAN

12:17.800 --> 12:20.266
NATURE YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE

12:20.333 --> 12:22.733
VERY OFTEN AND VOTE AGAINST

12:22.800 --> 12:24.500
THEIR OWN FREEDOM, SCOTLAND HAS

12:24.566 --> 12:26.000
REFERENDUM, THEY GO NO, WE DON'T

12:26.066 --> 12:29.300
WANT TO BE GOVERNED BY US.

12:29.366 --> 12:30.500
>> THE HISTORY BETWEEN THE

12:30.566 --> 12:31.400
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN

12:31.466 --> 12:32.166
PUERTO RICO IS DARK AND THERE'S

12:32.233 --> 12:33.300
A LOT WE DON'T TEACH IN OUR

12:33.366 --> 12:35.166
SCHOOLS AND IT'S REALLY

12:35.233 --> 12:35.466
COMPLICATED.

12:35.533 --> 12:37.300
>> Bill: EVEN MORE SO.

12:37.366 --> 12:39.333
>> EXACTLY AND THEY MADE

12:39.400 --> 12:40.200
THEMSELVES KNOWN AND THEY VOTED

12:40.266 --> 12:41.733
IN THE LAST DECADE THERE HAVE

12:41.800 --> 12:42.566
BEEN THREE REFERENDUMS AND THEY

12:42.633 --> 12:44.433
CLEARLY SAY THEY WANT TO BE

12:44.500 --> 12:45.266
ESTATE WITH A BARE MAJORITY BUT

12:45.333 --> 12:47.500
IT TAKES AN ACT OF CONGRESS AND

12:47.566 --> 12:48.066
RIGHT NOW CONGRESS HASN'T

12:48.133 --> 12:52.300
DECIDED TO ACT.

12:52.366 --> 12:53.533
>> Bill: WE PRAYED ABOUT THE

12:53.600 --> 12:55.366
TERM COURT PACKING, I REMEMBER

12:55.433 --> 12:57.966
THIS FROM EIGHTH GRADE HISTORY

12:58.033 --> 12:59.700
WHEN FDR -- THAT'S WHEN I HEARD

12:59.766 --> 13:04.066
ABOUT IT.

13:04.133 --> 13:04.966
I GUESS HE WAS FRUSTRATED IN THE

13:05.033 --> 13:06.700
SAME WAY MANY PRESIDENTS ARE

13:06.766 --> 13:07.800
WHEN THE COURT DOESN'T RULE IN

13:07.866 --> 13:09.066
THEIR FAVOR.

13:09.133 --> 13:10.766
SO HE WANTED TO ADD JUSTICES, IT

13:10.833 --> 13:13.766
LOOKED LIKE A POWER GRAB.

13:13.833 --> 13:14.566
BUT THEN IN THIS RECENT RUN-UP

13:14.633 --> 13:17.033
TO THE CONTROVERSY, WE'VE

13:17.100 --> 13:19.566
LEARNED THAT WELL, IT'S NOT

13:19.633 --> 13:21.100
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.533
THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY

13:22.600 --> 13:24.166
HOW MANY JUSTICES THERE -- WE

13:24.233 --> 13:25.400
COULD HAVE 100 TO.

13:25.466 --> 13:27.233
>> WE COULD, WE STARTED WITH

13:27.300 --> 13:29.366
SIX, THEN WENT DOWN TO FIVE,

13:29.433 --> 13:31.700
THEN SEVEN, THAN TEN, DOWN TO

13:31.766 --> 13:34.266
SEVEN, THEN BACK TO NINE.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.900
>> Bill: LIKE HUGH HEFNER'S

13:35.966 --> 13:36.900
GIRLFRIENDS IN THE LATER YEARS!

13:36.966 --> 13:37.166
[LAUGHTER]

13:37.233 --> 13:39.700
[APPLAUSE]

13:39.766 --> 13:42.433
>> WE'VE BEEN AT NINE SINCE 1869

13:42.500 --> 13:43.633
AND ALL IT TAKES LIKE A LOT OF

13:43.700 --> 13:44.800
THINGS TO CHANGE OUR GOVERNMENT,

13:44.866 --> 13:47.066
ALL IT TAKES IS AN ACT OF

13:47.133 --> 13:48.333
CONGRESS TO CHANGE THE NUMBERS.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.833
THE PROPOSAL IS TO GIVE FOUR

13:49.900 --> 13:52.266
MORE ADDITIONAL JUSTICES TO MAKE

13:52.333 --> 13:52.833
IT 13.

13:52.900 --> 13:53.800
>> Bill: BUT THAT WOULD LOOK

13:53.866 --> 13:55.466
LIKE A POWER GRAB, NOT THAT THEY

13:55.533 --> 13:58.300
DON'T KIND OF DESERVE IT BECAUSE

13:58.366 --> 13:59.933
OF THE WAY MITCH McCONNELL AND

14:00.000 --> 14:00.533
THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS

14:00.600 --> 14:02.233
COMPLETELY FUCKED THE DEMOCRATS

14:02.300 --> 14:04.500
IN A WAY THAT WAS COMPLETELY

14:04.566 --> 14:04.866
UNPRECEDENTED.

14:04.933 --> 14:10.166
[APPLAUSE]

14:10.233 --> 14:11.700
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF

14:11.766 --> 14:13.166
POLITICIZING THE COURT, ON THE

14:13.233 --> 14:15.233
OTHER HAND, THAT IS ONE OF THOSE

14:15.300 --> 14:18.333
THINGS THAT CANNOT STAND.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.266
THEY DENIED A PRESIDENT A PICK

14:20.333 --> 14:21.266
BECAUSE THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL

14:21.333 --> 14:23.100
RULES, YOU BROKE THE FUNDAMENTAL

14:23.166 --> 14:25.666
RULES, YOU BREAK THE FUNDAMENTAL

14:25.733 --> 14:25.966
RULES...

14:26.033 --> 14:27.533
>> IT GOES BACK TO THE IDEA WHY

14:27.600 --> 14:30.533
DO WE HAVE A COURT WITH LIFETIME

14:30.600 --> 14:31.166
APPOINTMENTS?

14:31.233 --> 14:32.800
THE ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO MAKE

14:32.866 --> 14:33.366
IT NONPARTISAN.

14:33.433 --> 14:35.800
>> Bill: THAT'S NOT IN THEIR

14:35.866 --> 14:37.066
EITHER?

14:37.133 --> 14:37.633
>> THAT IS IN THERE.

14:37.700 --> 14:40.666
>> Bill: THAT IS IN THERE!

14:40.733 --> 14:40.866
DANG.

14:40.933 --> 14:41.933
>> THE IDEA IS TO HAVE THE

14:42.000 --> 14:45.133
UNELECTED PEOPLE WHO HAVE

14:45.200 --> 14:45.933
ALLEGIANCE TO THE CONSTITUTION

14:46.000 --> 14:47.100
AND FEDERAL LAWS.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.433
TO HAVE AN EVENHANDED BALANCED

14:48.500 --> 14:50.600
COURT IS THE ORIGINAL IDEA.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.833
>> Bill: LIFETIME APPOINTMENT

14:52.900 --> 14:54.900
IS BAD BECAUSE I SEE WITH

14:54.966 --> 14:55.800
RUTH BADER GINSBURG, WE KNOW THE

14:55.866 --> 14:56.966
DEMOCRATS ARE MAD AT HER

14:57.033 --> 14:59.633
BECAUSE --

14:59.700 --> 15:00.633
>> SHE DIDN'T STEP DOWN.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.433
>> Bill: IT'S THEIR FAULT,

15:02.500 --> 15:04.266
THEIR PLAN WAS "SHE DOESN'T

15:04.333 --> 15:06.266
DIE."

15:06.333 --> 15:07.666
THAT'S NOT A PLAN.

15:07.733 --> 15:08.800
NOW STEPHEN BREYER IS THE NEXT

15:08.866 --> 15:13.166
LIBERAL, HE'S 82.

15:13.233 --> 15:14.666
WE HEARD WHEN GINSBERG WAS

15:14.733 --> 15:15.700
ALIVE, OBAMA HAD HER TO LUNCH

15:15.766 --> 15:22.066
AND WITHOUT SAYING "HEY, HOW'S

15:22.133 --> 15:22.400
YOUR HEALTH?"

15:22.466 --> 15:24.333
WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE

15:24.400 --> 15:26.666
NEXT FIVE YEARS?

15:26.733 --> 15:28.233
NOW THEY ARE DOING IT WITH

15:28.300 --> 15:30.033
STEPHEN BREYER.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.533
WHO WANTS THAT IN YOUR LIFE?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.866
PEOPLE HINTING --

15:36.933 --> 15:38.733
>> YOU SHOULD QUIT BECAUSE

15:38.800 --> 15:40.933
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE SOON.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.700
>> Bill: CRAZY SUBJECT OUT OF

15:42.766 --> 15:45.066
THIN AIR BUT HOW'S YOUR

15:45.133 --> 15:45.500
CHOLESTEROL, STEVE?

15:45.566 --> 15:46.900
WHY DO WE NEED A LIFETIME

15:46.966 --> 15:49.133
APPOINTMENT ANYWAY, WHAT IF IT

15:49.200 --> 15:50.133
WAS 18 YEARS?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.533
>> IT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY

15:51.600 --> 15:52.266
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS, THE

15:52.333 --> 15:53.866
IDEAS YOU HAVE AN 18 YEAR ON THE

15:53.933 --> 15:54.866
COURT BUT THEN YOU GO DOWN TO

15:54.933 --> 15:57.833
THE CIRCUIT COURT.

15:57.900 --> 15:58.300
YOU SHIFT THROUGH IT.

15:58.366 --> 16:00.900
THERE ARE WORKAROUNDS.

16:00.966 --> 16:02.133
UNCLEAR IF IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL,

16:02.200 --> 16:02.766
SOME PEOPLE SAY IT ISN'T SOME

16:02.833 --> 16:04.633
SAY IT ISN'T BUT THE IDEA OF

16:04.700 --> 16:06.166
LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS IS PUTTING

16:06.233 --> 16:08.133
A LOT OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF

16:08.200 --> 16:10.000
OLD PEOPLE.

16:10.066 --> 16:13.733
>> Bill: YOU MENTION THE

16:13.800 --> 16:14.966
CENSUS, THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE

16:15.033 --> 16:16.133
PEOPLE ARE MOVING OUT OF THE

16:16.200 --> 16:16.800
NORTHEAST AND THEY ARE MOVING TO

16:16.866 --> 16:19.900
THE SOUTH AND THE WEST.

16:19.966 --> 16:21.466
WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE

16:21.533 --> 16:23.133
LONG-TERM REPERCUSSIONS FOR

16:23.200 --> 16:23.333
THAT?

16:23.400 --> 16:26.833
>> SO YOU HAD SIX STATES AGAIN

16:26.900 --> 16:28.666
REPRESENTATIVES.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.000

16:30.066 --> 16:33.833
>> TEXAS, COLORADO, FLORIDA,

16:33.900 --> 16:34.700
OREGON, NORTH CAROLINA, AND

16:34.766 --> 16:37.100
OTHERS BUT IT'S A NET GAIN FOR

16:37.166 --> 16:40.366
RED STATES AND BLUE STATES LOST

16:40.433 --> 16:42.033
SEATS.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.566
JUST BY THE REAPPORTIONMENT,

16:43.633 --> 16:45.166
IT'S CUTTING THE DEMOCRATS LEAD

16:45.233 --> 16:48.866
IN THE HOUSE, BEFORE

16:48.933 --> 16:49.333
GERRYMANDERING, BEFORE

16:49.400 --> 16:52.433
REDISTRICTING, FROM FOUR TO TWO,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.166
IT'S A TWO SEAT ADVANTAGE IN THE

16:54.233 --> 16:55.200

17:42.033 --> 17:43.033
REBUTTAL THAT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD

17:43.100 --> 17:45.866
BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE.

17:45.933 --> 17:46.566
THEY ALWAYS WANT HIM TO FALL

17:46.633 --> 17:50.000
INTO THE WOKE TRAP AND HE JUST

17:50.066 --> 17:53.333
NEVER TAKES THE BAIT.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.733
THE ONLY WAY THEY WIN,

17:55.800 --> 17:57.300
POLITICALLY, IS ON CULTURAL

17:57.366 --> 17:58.166
ISSUES.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.500
BECAUSE HE REALLY IS BEING THE

17:59.566 --> 18:00.133
BLUE-COLLAR PRESIDENT.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.800
I KNOW THIS IS A BIG SUBJECT OF

18:01.866 --> 18:03.366
BOTH OF YOURS AND YOU WRITE

18:03.433 --> 18:04.166
BOOKS ABOUT IT, DO YOU THINK

18:04.233 --> 18:06.833
HE'S SUCCEEDING?

18:06.900 --> 18:08.966
WINNING BACK THE BLUE-COLLAR?

18:09.033 --> 18:12.200
IT SEEMED TO ME HE WAS.

18:12.266 --> 18:15.266
WITH THE SPEECH AND WHAT HE'S

18:15.333 --> 18:16.666
PROPOSING, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS

18:16.733 --> 18:17.366
WHAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN

18:17.433 --> 18:19.866
SAYING FOR YEARS.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.633
>> YES, I WAS REALLY PLEASED

18:21.700 --> 18:25.933
WHAT HE SAID IN THAT SPEECH.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.766
HE SAID THE MIDDLE-CLASS BUILT

18:26.833 --> 18:27.600
AMERICA AMERICA AND THE UNIONS

18:27.666 --> 18:30.500
BUILT MIDDLE CLASS.

18:30.566 --> 18:33.133
>> Bill: AND DEFENDED THE

18:33.200 --> 18:34.333
POLICE.

18:34.400 --> 18:34.966
>> HE ALSO SAID HEALTH CARE IS

18:35.033 --> 18:38.700
NOT A PRIVILEGE, IT'S A RIGHT,

18:38.766 --> 18:38.933
FANTASTIC!

18:39.000 --> 18:43.033
NICE GOING, JOE.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.000
SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO SAY

18:45.066 --> 18:47.800
HERE, JOE BIDEN'S CAREER AS A

18:47.866 --> 18:49.633
SENATOR SPANNED MANY DECADES,

18:49.700 --> 18:51.700
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME IT WAS NOT

18:51.766 --> 18:52.900
VERY PROMISING.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.833
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF HIGH

18:55.900 --> 18:56.333
HOPES FOR THE BIDEN

18:56.400 --> 18:56.700
ADMINISTRATION.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.066
>> Bill: A LOT OF PEOPLE DID

18:58.133 --> 18:58.400
NOT LIKE IT.

18:58.466 --> 19:00.500
>> HE WAS A DEFICIT HAWK AMONG

19:00.566 --> 19:02.766
OTHER THINGS, THAT'S GONE.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.333
LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DOING!

19:05.400 --> 19:06.166
AUSTERITY, ALL OF THAT OBAMA,

19:06.233 --> 19:09.366
LET'S HAVE A GRAND BARGAIN WITH

19:09.433 --> 19:10.866
REPUBLICANS, DON.

19:10.933 --> 19:12.500
IT'S FANTASTIC, VERY PLEASED.

19:12.566 --> 19:14.333
THE BIG QUESTION, OF COURSE, IS

19:14.400 --> 19:16.300
HE GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH?

19:16.366 --> 19:18.533
WHEN HE FINALLY DOES -- LOOK, SO

19:18.600 --> 19:21.200
FAR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY,

19:21.266 --> 19:22.666
CORPORATE AMERICA, THEY CAN

19:22.733 --> 19:24.166
HANDLE GIGANTIC SPENDING, THAT'S

19:24.233 --> 19:25.866
NOT A HUGE THREAT TO THEM BUT

19:25.933 --> 19:27.633
WHEN HE ACTUALLY GOES AND DOES

19:27.700 --> 19:28.666
SOMETHING LIKE THE PROACTIVE

19:28.733 --> 19:29.733
WITH A MINIMUM WAGE THEY ARE

19:29.800 --> 19:30.866
GOING TO START PUSHING BACK AND

19:30.933 --> 19:31.733
HE'S GOING TO GET SOME

19:31.800 --> 19:32.266
RESISTANCE.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.866
IS HE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW

19:33.933 --> 19:34.100
THROUGH?

19:34.166 --> 19:37.333
WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.533
[APPLAUSE]

19:39.600 --> 19:40.866
>> I CERTAINLY AGREE ON THE

19:40.933 --> 19:42.666
FOLLOW THROUGH AND I WISH HE HAD

19:42.733 --> 19:44.500
SPOKEN MORE ABOUT THE "FOR THE

19:44.566 --> 19:46.266
PEOPLE" ACT WHICH IS CRITICAL TO

19:46.333 --> 19:47.733
SAVING DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY

19:47.800 --> 19:49.700
BUT I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED AS

19:49.766 --> 19:51.266
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WAS NOT

19:51.333 --> 19:52.500
EXCITED TO HAVE HIM AS THE FRONT

19:52.566 --> 19:54.766
RUNNER, BUT I THINK HE IS DOING

19:54.833 --> 19:55.733
A REALLY EXCITING JOB.

19:55.800 --> 20:00.866
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A TERRIFIC

20:00.933 --> 20:04.833
SPEECH.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.133
JOE BIDEN UNDERSTANDS WE ARE AT

20:06.200 --> 20:07.566
THE PIVOT POINT, WE CAN EITHER

20:07.633 --> 20:08.700
SAVE DEMOCRACY BY SHOWING IT CAN

20:08.766 --> 20:10.900
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AND

20:10.966 --> 20:11.666
WE CAN DO THINGS PEOPLE LOOK THE

20:11.733 --> 20:13.266
GOVERNMENT TO DO OR WE ARE GOING

20:13.333 --> 20:15.833
TO LOSE IT, SLIDE INTO

20:15.900 --> 20:16.233
AUTHORITARIANISM.

20:16.300 --> 20:16.833
GIVING THE GERRYMANDERING AND

20:16.900 --> 20:17.833
ALL KINDS OF RIGGING YOU WERE

20:17.900 --> 20:19.166
TALKING TO BEN ABOUT, THAT IS

20:19.233 --> 20:21.000
THE QUESTION WE FACE.

20:21.066 --> 20:22.633
THESE ARE NOT ORDINARY ELECTIONS

20:22.700 --> 20:24.400
COMING AT US AND HE GRASPED THAT

20:24.466 --> 20:25.833
MOMENT AND I THINK THAT IS

20:25.900 --> 20:26.533
FANTASTIC.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.166
ALSO HE HAS BEEN PUSHED BY THE

20:28.233 --> 20:28.733
PROGRESSIVE BASE WHO DID THE

20:28.800 --> 20:31.800
WORK TO GET HIM ELECTED.

20:31.866 --> 20:34.266
[APPLAUSE]

20:34.333 --> 20:36.666
>> Bill: IF YOU WATCHED THE

20:36.733 --> 20:40.166
SPEECH, THERE WERE THINGS TEN

20:40.233 --> 20:42.233
YEARS AGO -- I DON'T THINK A

20:42.300 --> 20:43.633
BIPARTISAN GROUP LIKE THAT, HALF

20:43.700 --> 20:46.200
OF THEM WOULD NOT APPLAUD FOR.

20:46.266 --> 20:47.833
THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE WE ARE AT

20:47.900 --> 20:50.866
LEAST FOR THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS IN

20:50.933 --> 20:52.400
WASHINGTON, HOW MUCH THEY HATE

20:52.466 --> 20:53.133
EACH OTHER.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.366
>> CUTTING CHILD POVERTY IN

20:55.433 --> 20:56.500
HALF, COMPLETE SILENCE.

20:56.566 --> 20:58.366
SPEED WHEN I SAW THAT WITH OBAMA

20:58.433 --> 20:59.000
TOO.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.900
REALLY, YOU CAN'T APPLAUD TO

21:00.966 --> 21:01.533
THAT?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.200
YOU HATE THESE PEOPLE THIS MUCH?

21:03.266 --> 21:05.633
THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE THAT IS

21:05.700 --> 21:06.900
THE CHANGE THE BOATERS.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.000
THOSE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOTHING

21:08.066 --> 21:11.666
TO LOSE BY NOT APPLAUDING

21:11.733 --> 21:12.266
ANYTHING BECAUSE THERE BOATERS

21:12.333 --> 21:15.566
HATE SO MUCH.

21:15.633 --> 21:16.666
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

21:16.733 --> 21:20.166
YOU CAN'T GET THE POLITICIANS TO

21:20.233 --> 21:21.600
STOP HATING BECAUSE THEY ARE

21:21.666 --> 21:23.533
DOING IT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF

21:23.600 --> 21:24.000
THE VOTERS.

21:24.066 --> 21:26.133
BUT YOU CAN GET THE BOATERS TO

21:26.200 --> 21:27.366
STOP HATING BY DOING THE KIND OF

21:27.433 --> 21:29.500
STUFF HE'S STARTING TO DO.

21:29.566 --> 21:34.833
>> BEFORE WE BLAME THE VOTERS

21:34.900 --> 21:35.500
WHO BEAR THEIR SHARE OF BLAME,

21:35.566 --> 21:37.966
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DONORS,

21:38.033 --> 21:39.433
THE DONORS HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE

21:39.500 --> 21:40.400
HARD RIGHT DONORS FOR THE

21:40.466 --> 21:45.566
REPUBLICAN PARTY, ABOVE ALL THE

21:45.633 --> 21:47.600
KOCH NETWORK, THEY HAVE SET UP

21:47.666 --> 21:48.166
INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AND IT

21:48.233 --> 21:49.766
REWARDS BEHAVIOR WE ARE TALKING

21:49.833 --> 21:51.433
ABOUT WHERE THEY WILL NOT

21:51.500 --> 21:52.066
COMPROMISE ON ANYTHING.

21:52.133 --> 21:54.833
THEY THINK COMPROMISE IS A DIRTY

21:54.900 --> 21:56.700
WORD AND THEY AGITATE AND ALL OF

21:56.766 --> 21:58.033
THEIR ORGANIZATIONS AND MEDIA

21:58.100 --> 21:59.600
LIKE FOX NEWS AGITATE THE BASE

21:59.666 --> 22:01.933
INTO THINKING THIS IS A

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
DO-OR-DIE WAR FOR THEIR TRIBE.

22:04.066 --> 22:05.166
THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT ASSAULT

22:05.233 --> 22:06.700
FROM US AND WE HATE THEM AND

22:06.766 --> 22:07.300
DISRESPECT THEM AND DISREGARD

22:07.366 --> 22:10.400
THEM AND THEY GET INTO A

22:10.466 --> 22:10.966
STRESSED STATE THEY BECOME

22:11.033 --> 22:14.333
AGGRESSIVE AND ATTACK.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.966
YES, THE BOATERS, BUT THE

22:16.033 --> 22:16.200
DONORS.

22:16.266 --> 22:19.966
>> Bill: SOME OF THAT IS TRUE,

22:20.033 --> 22:24.166
A LOT OF LOOKING DOWN.

22:24.233 --> 22:27.900
>> I CAN'T HEAR YOU, DURING

22:27.966 --> 22:31.833
COVID I LOST MY HEARING.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.300
>> Bill: YOU RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

22:34.366 --> 22:35.766
THEY LOOKING DOWN ON PROBLEM.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.166
>> I CALL IT A UTOPIA OF

22:38.233 --> 22:38.733
SCOLDING BECAUSE THE PEOPLE

22:38.800 --> 22:42.833
DOING THE LOOKING DOWN ARE THE

22:42.900 --> 22:44.700
AFFLUENT, HIGHLY EDUCATED

22:44.766 --> 22:45.566
SUBURBANITES.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.733
THE KIND OF PEOPLE I AND YOU, WE

22:48.800 --> 22:50.900
KNOW THESE PEOPLE VERY WELL.

22:50.966 --> 22:52.633
THEY TEND TO BE DEMOCRATS, THEY

22:52.700 --> 22:54.033
ARE VERY WELL OFF, THEY ARE

22:54.100 --> 22:57.300
HIGHLY EDUCATED AND THEY REGARD

22:57.366 --> 22:58.966
THE WORLD, THEY REGARD -- LET ME

22:59.033 --> 23:01.666
PUT IT THIS WAY.

23:01.733 --> 23:10.966
TRUMP -ISM'S INCREDIBLE SHOCK TO

23:11.033 --> 23:12.433
THEM, THEY LAPSED INTO THIS

23:12.500 --> 23:17.266
SCOLDING WHERE LIBERALISM IS

23:17.333 --> 23:18.333
ABOUT PERSONAL VIRTUE AND

23:18.400 --> 23:19.233
LOOKING DOWN AND ALL THESE

23:19.300 --> 23:20.400
PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET IT AND

23:20.466 --> 23:21.533
THERE IS SOMETHING REPUGNANT

23:21.600 --> 23:25.866
ABOUT IT.

23:25.933 --> 23:29.000
TRUMP CUT THEIR TAXES, THEY ARE

23:29.066 --> 23:31.100
GETTING RICHER BY THE MINUTE.

23:31.166 --> 23:35.400
>> Bill: JAMES CARVILLE GAME

23:35.466 --> 23:37.933
AN INTERVIEW TO OUR FRIEND SEAN

23:38.000 --> 23:40.400
ELLING OVER AT VOX AND IT GOT A

23:40.466 --> 23:41.733
LOT OF PICKUP BECAUSE HE FINALLY

23:41.800 --> 23:42.900
GOT JAMES TO COME OUT OF HIS

23:42.966 --> 23:45.766
SHELL AND SAY WHAT HE REALLY

23:45.833 --> 23:46.933
MEANS.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.433
I'M JOKING, HE DOES THAT ALL THE

23:49.500 --> 23:51.733
TIME.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.000
[LAUGHTER]

23:52.066 --> 23:55.400
HERE'S CARPAL "WOKENESS IS A

23:55.466 --> 23:56.266
PROBLEM AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.000
IT'S HARD TO TALK TO ANYONE WHO

23:58.066 --> 23:58.833
DOESN'T SAY THIS BUT THEY DON'T

23:58.900 --> 24:01.400
WANT TO SAY IT OUT LOUD."

24:01.466 --> 24:02.933
WE'VE BEEN SAYING IT OUT LOUD ON

24:03.000 --> 24:04.200
THIS SHOW FOR QUITE SOME TIME

24:04.266 --> 24:09.166
BUT I GET YOUR POINT.

24:09.233 --> 24:11.133
THEY WILL GET CLOBBERED OR

24:11.200 --> 24:12.833
CANCELED, THIS TOO COOL FOR

24:12.900 --> 24:13.833
SCHOOL SHIT DOESN'T WORK AND WE

24:13.900 --> 24:15.700
HAVE TO STOP IT.

24:15.766 --> 24:16.633
I FEEL LIKE THE BATTLE IN THE

24:16.700 --> 24:20.500
PARTY IS THAT JOE DOES NOT GET

24:20.566 --> 24:22.933
SUCKED INTO THIS BULLSHIT, BUT

24:23.000 --> 24:23.633
THE PARTY DOES.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.766
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALL

24:25.833 --> 24:27.066
THEY DO.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.600
I ALWAYS SAY ON THIS SHOW,

24:30.666 --> 24:33.933
YOU'RE ALWAYS PART OF THE PARTY

24:34.000 --> 24:38.600
OF, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO.

24:38.666 --> 24:40.400
WE ONLY HAVE TWO PARTIES.

24:40.466 --> 24:41.766
THE OSCARS, YOU'RE THE PARTY OF

24:41.833 --> 24:42.800
THE DEMOCRATS, WHATEVER YOU DO

24:42.866 --> 24:44.033
THAT'S THE WAY AMERICA IS GOING

24:44.100 --> 24:45.800
TO SEE IT.

24:45.866 --> 24:46.966
WHATEVER CRAZY SHIT HAPPENS ON

24:47.033 --> 24:49.133
THE LEFT, THAT IS WHY THEY GAVE

24:49.200 --> 24:49.833
THE REBUTTAL SPEECH THEY GAVE,

24:49.900 --> 24:52.133
THEY GAVE IT TO THE SPEECH THEY

24:52.200 --> 24:53.766
WANTED HIM TO MAKE WHERE HE WAS

24:53.833 --> 24:58.433
WOKE AND IT WASN'T THAT SPEECH.

24:58.500 --> 25:02.533
AGAIN, THAT'S HOW THEY WIN.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.966
CARVILLE SAYS "YOU GET THE SENSE

25:05.033 --> 25:06.933
THAT PEOPLE IN FACULTY LOUNGES

25:07.000 --> 25:08.166
IN FANCY COLLEGES USE A

25:08.233 --> 25:10.866
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE THAN ORDINARY

25:10.933 --> 25:12.633
PEOPLE."

25:12.700 --> 25:16.666
HE MENTIONED LATINX AND PEOPLE

25:16.733 --> 25:18.633
ARGUED WITH ME WE NEED THAT WORD

25:18.700 --> 25:20.166
AND THE POLLING SHOWED NO ONE

25:20.233 --> 25:23.000
LIKES IT, NO ONE USES IT, THIS

25:23.066 --> 25:27.866
IS YOUR INSANITY.

25:27.933 --> 25:28.133
[APPLAUSE]

25:28.200 --> 25:30.566
IT OBSCURES THE FACT, THIS KIND

25:30.633 --> 25:33.100
OF CRAZINESS OBSCURES THE FACT

25:33.166 --> 25:34.333
DEMOCRATS DID GIVE PEOPLE A

25:34.400 --> 25:36.000
OBAMACARE, AT LEAST STARTED TO

25:36.066 --> 25:37.633
SOLVE THE HEALTH CARE THING, THE

25:37.700 --> 25:39.600
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

25:39.666 --> 25:41.966
BUREAU SAVED THE AUTO INDUSTRY,

25:42.033 --> 25:47.233
THE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT THAT

25:47.300 --> 25:49.533
TRUMP GAVE, GOT BACK TO THE

25:49.600 --> 25:50.133
MIDDLE CLASS THEY DO THE WORK

25:50.200 --> 25:52.500
AND THEY DON'T GET THE CREDIT.

25:52.566 --> 25:54.166
>> THE DEMOCRATS I KNOW, YOU

25:54.233 --> 25:55.800
KNOW DIFFERENT ONES BEING IN THE

25:55.866 --> 25:57.533
D.C. REGION, THE DEMOCRATS I

25:57.600 --> 25:58.933
KNOW TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.866
THEY ARE ON THE DOORS, THEY ARE

26:00.933 --> 26:01.833
ON THE PHONE AND THEY KNOW HOW

26:01.900 --> 26:04.466
TO TALK TO PEOPLE IN PLAIN

26:04.533 --> 26:04.733
LANGUAGE.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.133
I COME FROM A PRIVATE UNIVERSITY

26:06.200 --> 26:08.333
WITH THE FACULTY LOUNGE, I DON'T

26:08.400 --> 26:09.466
LIKE JARGON FOR MY STUDENTS COME

26:09.533 --> 26:11.266
UP FOR MY COLLEAGUES ANYWHERE IN

26:11.333 --> 26:12.500
THE WORLD BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY

26:12.566 --> 26:16.033
IMPORTANT THAT WE MAY BE NOT

26:16.100 --> 26:16.600
FALL INTO THE TERMS THAT OUR

26:16.666 --> 26:19.000
OPPONENTS HAVE SET.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.933
SINCE THE NEW DEAL AND YOU KNOW

26:21.000 --> 26:22.100
THIS AS WELL AS I HAVE BEEN

26:22.166 --> 26:24.800
CALLING DEMOCRATS ARROGANT

26:24.866 --> 26:25.966
BECAUSE WE LET WORKERS SPEAK UP

26:26.033 --> 26:28.733
TO BOSSES AND HAVE A SAY IN HOW

26:28.800 --> 26:30.133
THEIR WORKPLACES ARE ROTTEN.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.333
THEY STARTED THE TROPE OF THE

26:31.400 --> 26:32.766
LIBERAL MEDIA IN THAT TIME OF

26:32.833 --> 26:35.600
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT TO

26:35.666 --> 26:36.600
DISCREDIT NORTHERN REPORTERS WHO

26:36.666 --> 26:37.333
WERE COMING DOWN AND TELLING THE

26:37.400 --> 26:38.766
TRUTH ABOUT THE SOUTH, THAT'S

26:38.833 --> 26:40.466
WHEN THEY STARTED SAYING DON'T

26:40.533 --> 26:41.333
TRUST THE LIBERAL MEDIA.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.533
THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS LINE

26:42.600 --> 26:45.566
FOR A LONG TIME.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.866
ARE THERE WORD CHOICES I WOULD

26:47.933 --> 26:49.166
FIND UNFORTUNATE?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.066
YEAH, BUT ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF

26:50.133 --> 26:52.033
PAIN IN THIS COUNTRY, A LOT OF

26:52.100 --> 26:52.666
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STEPPED ON FOR

26:52.733 --> 26:54.533
A LONG TIME.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.300
GEORGE FLOYD WAS STEPPED ON FOR

26:56.366 --> 26:58.466
9 MINUTES AND THAT WOKE UP THE

26:58.533 --> 27:00.066
COUNTRY.

27:00.133 --> 27:03.566
THAT KIND OF WOKE, WE NEED TO BE

27:03.633 --> 27:03.833
WAKING UP.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.500
>> Bill: DO WE NEED TO BE

27:06.566 --> 27:07.500
WOKEN UP 24/7?

27:07.566 --> 27:10.133
THAT'S A PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE

27:10.200 --> 27:10.666
WITH THE OSCARS.

27:10.733 --> 27:11.800
>> NOBODY LIKES

27:11.866 --> 27:13.866
SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS, MAYBE I JUST

27:13.933 --> 27:15.466
DID SOME SO DON'T HATE ME.

27:15.533 --> 27:15.800
[LAUGHTER]

27:15.866 --> 27:18.500
WE ALL NEED TO LAUGH AT

27:18.566 --> 27:19.000
OURSELVES.

27:19.066 --> 27:20.866
>> Bill: SOMETHING, IT'S AN

27:20.933 --> 27:22.200
INDUSTRY ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT AND

27:22.266 --> 27:24.000
THIS SHOW IS ALWAYS ABOUT

27:24.066 --> 27:25.400
ENTERTAINMENT AND THEY PUT ON A

27:25.466 --> 27:27.766
SHOW AND THEY WERE LIKE "WE DARE

27:27.833 --> 27:32.266
YOU TO BE ENTERTAINED."

27:32.333 --> 27:33.866
[LAUGHTER]

27:33.933 --> 27:34.466
[APPLAUSE]

27:34.533 --> 27:38.566
NO JOKES, NO SONGS, NOT EVEN ANY

27:38.633 --> 27:42.066
CLIPS, WHEN WE USED TO HAVE FUN.

27:42.133 --> 27:46.666
FUCK YOU, EAT YOUR PEAS.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.000
THIS IS -- UBIQUITY FOR ANY

27:49.066 --> 27:49.766
CAUSE DOESN'T HELP.

27:49.833 --> 27:51.233
>> I HAVE TO TAKE YOUR WORD FOR

27:51.300 --> 27:53.166
IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WATCH, I

27:53.233 --> 27:55.266
HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE MOVIES SINCE

27:55.333 --> 27:56.000
LAST FEBRUARY!

27:56.066 --> 27:57.966
I DIDN'T SEE THE OSCARS BECAUSE

27:58.033 --> 27:59.400
I DIDN'T SEE THE MOVIES.

27:59.466 --> 28:02.566
I THINK A LOT OF US FELT LIKE

28:02.633 --> 28:03.200
THAT.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.400
WE CAN DO ANYTHING NORMAL LIKE

28:05.466 --> 28:06.400
GOING TO THE MOVIES WITH

28:06.466 --> 28:07.666
FRIENDS, WHY WOULD WE GO TO THE

28:07.733 --> 28:07.900
OSCARS?

28:07.966 --> 28:10.100
I THINK IT'S A BLIP.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.166
>> IS TWO DIFFERENT MODELS FOR

28:12.233 --> 28:13.000
HOW YOU DO LIBERALISM IN THIS

28:13.066 --> 28:15.333
COUNTRY AND ONE I CALL AS THE

28:15.400 --> 28:16.300
POPULIST MODEL REFERRING TO BACK

28:16.366 --> 28:18.533
WHEN WE HAD THREE PARTIES IN THE

28:18.600 --> 28:19.266
COUNTRY, ONE WAS CALLED THE

28:19.333 --> 28:21.400
POPULIST PARTY, IT WAS A

28:21.466 --> 28:22.400
LEFT-WING FARMER-LABORER.

28:22.466 --> 28:25.033
>> Bill: WHEN WAS THIS?

28:25.100 --> 28:26.800
>> THE 1890s.

28:26.866 --> 28:28.233
>> Bill: OH, YEAH.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.266
>> YOU ARE YOU ARE A MEMBER,

28:31.333 --> 28:31.500
COME ON!

28:31.566 --> 28:33.566
>> Bill: GOOD TIMES.

28:33.633 --> 28:34.933
>> THE POPULIST TRADITION

28:35.000 --> 28:35.200
BELIEVE --

28:35.266 --> 28:39.133
>> Bill: WAS THAT THE GAY

28:39.200 --> 28:41.066
90s?

28:41.133 --> 28:43.900
>> IT WAS A TERRIBLE

28:43.966 --> 28:44.233
DEPRESSION --

28:44.300 --> 28:45.866
>> IN NEW YORK, THEY CALLED IT

28:45.933 --> 28:46.166
THE GAY 90s.

28:46.233 --> 28:47.766
>> IT WAS A TIME WHEN THE

28:47.833 --> 28:49.900
ECONOMY WAS SHRINKING, IT WAS

28:49.966 --> 28:52.900
AWFUL, STRIKES, MARCHES ON

28:52.966 --> 28:54.266
WASHINGTON, THERE IS TWO WAYS OF

28:54.333 --> 28:55.266
DOING THIS.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.500
YOU BUILD A MASS MOVEMENT OF

28:56.566 --> 28:58.133
ORDINARY PEOPLE AND TO DO THAT

28:58.200 --> 28:59.166
YOU CAN'T BE SOME KIND OF

28:59.233 --> 29:00.566
JUDGMENTAL PRICK THAT GOES

29:00.633 --> 29:02.433
AROUND USING THIS KIND OF JARGON

29:02.500 --> 29:04.066
AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT A FINE

29:04.133 --> 29:07.133
AND NOBLE INDIVIDUAL YOU ARE.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.700
THE OTHER MODEL IS IDEOLOGICAL

29:08.766 --> 29:11.600
PURITY WHERE YOUR POLITICS ARE A

29:11.666 --> 29:12.166
FASHION ACCESSORY AND THAT'S

29:12.233 --> 29:15.966
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING.

29:16.033 --> 29:17.666
THAT IS -- TO USE EVERYBODY'S

29:17.733 --> 29:19.333
FAVORITE WORD, TOXIC.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.933
THIS IS NO WAY TO GO FORWARD, IF

29:23.000 --> 29:23.833
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

29:23.900 --> 29:25.466
WAS DOING, TRUMP WILL BE BACK

29:25.533 --> 29:25.866
TOMORROW.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.100
>> Bill: IT WOULDN'T BE SO

29:27.166 --> 29:29.133
HARD TO FIX THIS, AND THE

29:29.200 --> 29:30.500
REBUTTAL SPEECH THE REPUBLICANS

29:30.566 --> 29:32.700
PICKED THEIR ONE BLACK SENATOR,

29:32.766 --> 29:34.466
TIM SCOTT WHO GETS A LOT OF WORK

29:34.533 --> 29:38.200
ON TV.

29:38.266 --> 29:41.766
AND HE SAID "AMERICA IS NOT A

29:41.833 --> 29:42.566
RACIST COUNTRY."

29:42.633 --> 29:44.733
AND WITHIN 24 HOURS, BIDEN

29:44.800 --> 29:45.966
AGREED WITH THAT, KAMALA HARRIS

29:46.033 --> 29:48.900
AGREED WITH THAT, I THINK IT'S A

29:48.966 --> 29:50.266
SILLY PARADIGM TO BEGIN WITH

29:50.333 --> 29:51.800
BECAUSE IT'S NOT EITHER-OR, IT'S

29:51.866 --> 29:56.066
NOT A PREGNANCY TEST.

29:56.133 --> 30:00.333
"IT'S BLUE, WE ARE NOT.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.266
"TIM SCOTT BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT,

30:01.333 --> 30:03.600
HE SAID ONE TIME HE WAS PULLED

30:03.666 --> 30:05.200
OVER SEVEN TIMES IN A YEAR, HE

30:05.266 --> 30:06.533
SAID HE'S BEEN FOLLOWED

30:06.600 --> 30:08.600
SHOPPING, HE'S THE ONE BLACK

30:08.666 --> 30:09.533
REPUBLICAN SENATOR, THIS IS

30:09.600 --> 30:12.333
EVIDENCE OF RACISM!

30:12.400 --> 30:13.566
PLAINLY, WE ARE A RECOVERING

30:13.633 --> 30:15.333
RACIST COUNTRY OR SOMETHING.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.300
BOTH THINGS ARE TRUE.

30:18.366 --> 30:19.833
>> I FELT SORRY FOR THE MAN, HE

30:19.900 --> 30:22.666
COMES FROM THE PARTY THAT WORKED

30:22.733 --> 30:23.766
WITH THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY TO

30:23.833 --> 30:26.033
DENY THE HARMS OF TOBACCO SMOKE,

30:26.100 --> 30:27.266
THEN IS WORKING WITH THE CAPTURE

30:27.333 --> 30:32.066
BY FOSSIL FUEL WITH CLIMATE, AND

30:32.133 --> 30:34.833
HE'S THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.733
HE DENIED THE INSURRECTION AND

30:36.800 --> 30:37.833
THE ELECTION.

30:37.900 --> 30:38.900
YOU THINK HE WOULD COME AROUND

30:38.966 --> 30:40.566
AND SAY HOW COME THEY KEEP

30:40.633 --> 30:43.500
MAKING ME RUN POINT?

30:43.566 --> 30:43.966
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

30:44.033 --> 30:45.966
>> Bill: I AGREE.

30:46.033 --> 30:50.800
I DON'T THINK KAMALA HARRIS AND

30:50.866 --> 30:51.700
BIDEN ARE BEING DISINGENUOUS

30:51.766 --> 30:52.900
WHEN THEY AGREE WITH THAT

30:52.966 --> 30:54.333
BECAUSE THEY ARE THINKING OF THE

30:54.400 --> 30:55.800
MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

30:55.866 --> 30:57.333
NOT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE

30:57.400 --> 30:59.866
TOLD ALL THE TIME, EVERY DAY,

30:59.933 --> 31:01.766
"COME ON, YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT A

31:01.833 --> 31:03.266
RACIST?

31:03.333 --> 31:05.600
DIG A LITTLE DEEPER."

31:05.666 --> 31:06.100
>> EXACTLY.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.733
>> Bill: THEY ARE SAYING I

31:07.800 --> 31:09.300
DIDN'T FOLLOW ANYONE IN THE

31:09.366 --> 31:11.300
STORE, I DIDN'T PULL ANYBODY

31:11.366 --> 31:11.966
OVER.

31:12.033 --> 31:13.800
EVEN IF IT'S MY ANCESTORS, THAT

31:13.866 --> 31:16.533
WASN'T ME EITHER, THAT KIND OF

31:16.600 --> 31:16.733
THING.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.700
INDIVIDUAL VERSUS COLLECTIVE

31:18.766 --> 31:18.900
GUILT.

31:18.966 --> 31:22.133
>> I THINK THAT'S THE

31:22.200 --> 31:22.766
PROFESSIONAL CULTURE THAT TOM

31:22.833 --> 31:24.466
HAS CRITIQUED SO WELL COMES INTO

31:24.533 --> 31:26.700
PLAY BECAUSE IT'S A THERAPEUTIC

31:26.766 --> 31:26.933
MODEL.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.066
RACISM IS A SIN IN OUR HEARTS OR

31:29.133 --> 31:30.200
IT'S SOMETHING WRONG IN OUR

31:30.266 --> 31:32.500
THINKING PROCESS AND IT'S ALL ON

31:32.566 --> 31:35.833
US AS INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME

31:35.900 --> 31:37.500
VIRTUOUS AND NONRACIST AND

31:37.566 --> 31:37.800
ANTIRACIST.

31:37.866 --> 31:39.200
>> Bill: ON OUR OWN.

31:39.266 --> 31:40.133
>> THESE STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN

31:40.200 --> 31:42.100
HERE SINCE THE FOUNDING OF OUR

31:42.166 --> 31:43.833
COUNTRY, THEY HAVE PERPETUATED

31:43.900 --> 31:45.000
IN DIFFERENT WAYS, WEALTH

31:45.066 --> 31:46.233
INEQUALITY IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR

31:46.300 --> 31:47.400
IN RACISM AND HARM TO

31:47.466 --> 31:49.266
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LIVES.

31:49.333 --> 31:50.866
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

31:50.933 --> 31:52.166
CONVERSATION BUT FORTUNATELY

31:52.233 --> 31:52.866
THAT WORK HAS ALREADY STARTED

31:52.933 --> 31:55.166
WITH THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK

31:55.233 --> 31:56.333
LIVES, WITH THE RESPONSE TO

31:56.400 --> 31:58.533
GEORGE FLOYD, I THINK WE HAVE TO

31:58.600 --> 32:00.466
KEEP THAT CONVERSATION GOING AND

32:00.533 --> 32:02.400
ALSO MAKE AN EXIT RAMP FOR WHITE

32:02.466 --> 32:03.966
PEOPLE FROM THE NOTION THAT THEY

32:04.033 --> 32:07.666
ARE TRAPPED WITH THESE OTHER

32:07.733 --> 32:07.866
FOLKS.

32:07.933 --> 32:10.566
I THINK THE WAY TO DO THAT IS

32:10.633 --> 32:11.700
PRECISELY BY UNDERSTANDING THIS

32:11.766 --> 32:13.700
IS A COUNTRY OF BOTH THINGS.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.333
IT HAS A VERY RACIST HISTORY AND

32:16.400 --> 32:17.433
HAS A REALLY IMPRESSIVE

32:17.500 --> 32:19.033
ANTIRACIST HISTORY.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.800
WE ARE BOTH SPIRIT >> THAT'S

32:21.866 --> 32:22.966
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY BUT YOU

32:23.033 --> 32:25.200
COULD EXTEND THAT IN ALL SORTS

32:25.266 --> 32:26.533
OF OTHER WAYS.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.733
THIS IS IN SOME WAYS THE MOST

32:27.800 --> 32:29.700
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,

32:29.766 --> 32:30.300
THE MOST EGALITARIAN PEOPLE I

32:30.366 --> 32:32.766
HAVE EVER MET AND IT'S AT THE

32:32.833 --> 32:34.266
SAME TIME, THIS COUNTRY THAT

32:34.333 --> 32:37.000
HAS -- HAS ALWAYS HAD SINCE THE

32:37.066 --> 32:37.600
BEGINNING, THIS PROFOUND

32:37.666 --> 32:41.266
SUSPICION OF DEMOCRACY.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.333
THIS FEAR OF THE LOWER ORDERS

32:43.400 --> 32:44.500
RISING UP IN THEIR INSOLENCE AND

32:44.566 --> 32:46.733
OUT OF VOTING US AND DOING SOME

32:46.800 --> 32:47.100
DREADFUL THING.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.166
YOU SEE THIS ALL THE TIME AROUND

32:49.233 --> 32:50.033
US NOW BUT BOTH THINGS HAPPEN IN

32:50.100 --> 32:52.966
THE SAME COUNTRY.

32:53.033 --> 32:54.566
YOU SET A PREGNANCY TEST, I WAS

32:54.633 --> 32:56.400
GOING TO SAY BEFORE THE THRONE

32:56.466 --> 32:59.800
OF GOD SIFTING OUT OUR SOULS.

32:59.866 --> 33:00.533
>> Bill: WITH BIDEN PULLING SO

33:00.600 --> 33:02.933
WELL, I NOTICED THE RIGHT-WING

33:03.000 --> 33:05.933
MEDIA HAS HAD TO RAMP UP THE

33:06.000 --> 33:06.366
LYING.

33:06.433 --> 33:08.266
IT'S INTERESTING, WE THOUGHT WE

33:08.333 --> 33:09.466
WERE OVER THIS A LITTLE BIT WHEN

33:09.533 --> 33:14.400
TRUMP LEFT BUT SHOW THE MEAT

33:14.466 --> 33:14.566
ONE.

33:14.633 --> 33:18.833
THIS IS FOX NEWS, THIS IS NOT A

33:18.900 --> 33:19.766
JOKE.

33:19.833 --> 33:21.133
"CUT 90% OF RED MEAT FROM DIET"

33:21.200 --> 33:22.466
THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE CLAIMING

33:22.533 --> 33:26.000
BIDEN IS GOING TO MAKE YOU DO.

33:26.066 --> 33:28.366
MAX 4 POUNDS FOR YEAR, ONE

33:28.433 --> 33:29.100
BURGER PER MONTH.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.233
IF THAT IS FOX NEWS, THAT'S A

33:31.300 --> 33:32.166
MAJOR NEWS OUTLET.

33:32.233 --> 33:34.133
>> I WOULD BECOME A REPUBLICAN

33:34.200 --> 33:34.933
IF THAT REALLY HAPPENED.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.600
>> IT'S WHAT THEY DO, THEY

33:36.666 --> 33:42.100
ACTIVATE THE REPTILIAN BRAIN.

33:42.166 --> 33:44.300
>> Bill: ANOTHER ONE,

33:44.366 --> 33:45.866
FOURTH OF JULY CANCELED, THESE

42:22.766 --> 42:25.133
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

42:25.200 --> 42:29.100
HE DOES IS NAFTA.

42:29.166 --> 42:29.700
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME READING

42:29.766 --> 42:33.166
THE SPEECH HE GAVE WHEN HE

42:34.400 --> 42:35.833
YOU ARE SCREWED YOU HAVE TO GET

42:35.900 --> 42:37.700
USED TO IT, THIS IS A NEW

42:37.766 --> 42:40.233

42:40.300 --> 42:41.100
EDUCATED.

42:41.166 --> 42:42.300
PROSPERITY MATTERS AND WE ARE

42:42.366 --> 42:43.666
GOING TO TRAIN ALL OF THE PEOPLE

42:43.733 --> 42:48.700
WHOSE LIVES ARE RUINED.

42:48.766 --> 42:51.033
HE DOES AWAY WITH THE WELFARE

42:51.100 --> 42:51.266
SYSTEM.

42:51.333 --> 42:52.766
>> Bill: HE DOESN'T DO AWAY

42:52.833 --> 42:55.100
WITH THE WELFARE SYSTEM.

42:55.166 --> 42:56.366
>> IT WAS OVERTURNED.

42:56.433 --> 42:58.033
>> Bill: WE STILL HAVE WELFARE

42:58.100 --> 43:00.100
IN THIS COUNTRY.

43:00.166 --> 43:02.500
>> AFDC, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

43:02.566 --> 43:04.233
CALL IT, HE GOES AROUND TO

43:04.300 --> 43:05.466
DEREGULATES WALL STREET,

43:05.533 --> 43:10.533
DEREGULATES YET AGAIN.

43:10.600 --> 43:17.033
>> Bill: GLASS-STEAGALL?

43:17.100 --> 43:18.633
>> THEY OVERTURNED THAT.

43:18.700 --> 43:19.333
>> Bill: CLINTON DEFINITELY

43:19.400 --> 43:21.066
MOVE THE DEMOCRATS TO THE

43:21.133 --> 43:22.133
CENTER, WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.000
>> HE MOVED THE DEMOCRATS TO THE

43:24.066 --> 43:24.266
RIGHT.

43:24.333 --> 43:26.400
IT IS TO BE ONE MORE RIGHTWARD

43:26.466 --> 43:26.733
TO THE CENTER.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.566
>> YOU THINK THAT'S THE CENTER?

43:28.633 --> 43:30.266
THIS COUNTRY DIDN'T WANT THOSE

43:30.333 --> 43:31.600
THINGS, THIS COUNTRY DIDN'T WANT

43:31.666 --> 43:34.100
TO DEREGULATE WALL STREET?

43:34.166 --> 43:36.500
>> Bill: WHY DID HE GET

43:36.566 --> 43:37.266
ELECTED TWICE?

43:37.333 --> 43:38.366
>> BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVES

43:38.433 --> 43:39.500
WEREN'T SO GOOD EITHER AND THERE

43:39.566 --> 43:41.966
WAS ROSS PEROT IN THE BEGINNING.

43:42.033 --> 43:46.633
>> ROSS PEROT HELPED HIM A LOT.

43:46.700 --> 43:47.566
>> DEMOCRATS LOST THE SELF NOT

43:47.633 --> 43:49.033
WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AS THE

43:49.100 --> 43:51.233
LEGEND GOES -- THEY LOST IN

43:51.300 --> 43:52.400
PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS AFTER THE

43:52.466 --> 43:55.266
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BUT SOME RECENT

43:55.333 --> 43:56.766
RESEARCH BY A WONDERFUL ECONOMIC

43:56.833 --> 43:57.966
HISTORIAN GAVIN WRIGHT HAS

43:58.033 --> 44:00.166
SHOWED IT WAS NAFTA DID IN THE

44:00.233 --> 44:02.333
DEMOCRATS OF THE STATE LEVEL.

44:02.400 --> 44:03.100
SO MANY SOUTHERN STATES STILL

44:03.166 --> 44:04.533
HAD DEMOCRATS AND STATEHOUSES,

44:04.600 --> 44:06.133
IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE, IN

44:06.200 --> 44:10.666
OTHER STATE POSITIONS --

44:10.733 --> 44:13.933
>> WE ALWAYS SAY NAFTA OR CHINA

44:14.000 --> 44:17.266
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE JOE BIDEN IS

44:17.333 --> 44:17.866
AT LEAST TALKING THE TALK THAT

44:17.933 --> 44:22.433
WAS NOT MY OBAMA OR CLINTON.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.300
>> I SHOULD SHUT UP, I KNOW I

44:24.366 --> 44:25.933
TALK WAY TOO MUCH.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.766
>> Bill: NO, NO!

44:29.833 --> 44:34.166
YOU'RE ON A TALK SHOW.

44:34.233 --> 44:34.633
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

44:34.700 --> 44:36.566
>> PEOPLE REGARD THESE MOVES

44:36.633 --> 44:37.200
BILL CLINTON MADE IS ABSOLUTELY

44:37.266 --> 44:40.700
GENIUS AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

44:40.766 --> 44:41.066
THEY REDEFINED.

44:41.133 --> 44:41.866
>> Bill: NO.

44:41.933 --> 44:44.400
>> THEY REDEFINED THE PARTY WAS

44:44.466 --> 44:45.300
IN A DISASTROUS WAY, IN A

44:45.366 --> 44:48.233
CATASTROPHIC WAY AND I AM HOPING

44:48.300 --> 44:49.166
AND I THINK BIDEN UNDERSTANDS --

44:49.233 --> 44:51.300
I THINK HE WENT ALONG WITH

44:51.366 --> 44:53.233
EVERYTHING I JUST DESCRIBED AND

44:53.300 --> 44:54.666
THEN SOME.

44:54.733 --> 44:56.133
THE BANKRUPTCY BILL UNDER

44:56.200 --> 44:56.933
GEORGE BUSH, MASS INCARCERATION

44:57.000 --> 44:58.500
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

44:58.566 --> 45:02.833
BIDEN SEEMS TO HAVE GRASPED THE

45:02.900 --> 45:07.533
FOLLY OF ALL THIS.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.933
THIS WAS A WORLD HISTORICAL

45:10.000 --> 45:11.400
MISTAKE, A BLUNDER THE DEMOCRATS

45:11.466 --> 45:13.266
MADE IN THE 90s AND CONTINUING

45:13.333 --> 45:14.333
UP UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.133
>> BIDEN ISN'T ALONE IN THAT AND

45:16.200 --> 45:18.666
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WE ARE IN A

45:18.733 --> 45:20.866
DIFFERENT MOMENT NOW BECAUSE THE

45:20.933 --> 45:22.466
WHOLE COUNTRY HAS CHANGED, THE

45:22.533 --> 45:24.533
FALLACY OF THAT TAXCUTTING

45:24.600 --> 45:25.100
AUSTERITY POLITICS HAS BEEN

45:25.166 --> 45:26.800
PROVEN IN A WAY THAT HAS

45:26.866 --> 45:28.500
DEVASTATED PEOPLE'S LIVES, MADE

45:28.566 --> 45:30.566
US UNABLE TO DEAL WITH THE

45:30.633 --> 45:32.100
CORONAVIRUS.

45:32.166 --> 45:33.266
ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN CHANGING

45:33.333 --> 45:35.500
RECKONING WITH ALL OF THIS AMONG

45:35.566 --> 45:36.566
THINKERS INCLUDING ECONOMISTS

45:36.633 --> 45:39.133
WHO WORKED WITH CLINTON, THE TWO

45:39.200 --> 45:40.400
MOST FAMOUS ECONOMISTS WHO

45:40.466 --> 45:42.533
WORKED WITH CLINTON, JOE

45:42.600 --> 45:43.900
STIEGLITZ AND ROBERT REICH ARE

45:43.966 --> 45:46.466
TRUMPETING THINGS BIDEN IS DOIN

45:46.533 --> 45:46.766
DOING.

45:46.833 --> 45:48.633
I THINK WE ARE POTENTIALLY IN A

45:48.700 --> 45:50.366
MOMENT OF HUGE HISTORICAL

45:50.433 --> 45:52.933
SEA CHANGE.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.366
>> Bill: WAY TO END THAT

45:55.433 --> 45:58.700
CONVERSATION, THANK YOU!

45:58.766 --> 45:59.433
POSITIVE!

45:59.500 --> 46:01.266
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HERE COME A

46:01.333 --> 46:04.666
TIME FOR NEW RULES, EVERYBODY!

46:04.733 --> 46:06.400
RULES.

46:06.466 --> 46:08.366
NEW RULE: NOW THAT THE U.S. IS

46:08.433 --> 46:09.000
GOING TO SHARE UP TO 60 MILLION

46:09.066 --> 46:10.100
DOSES OF ITS ASTRAZENECA VACCINE

46:10.166 --> 46:10.700
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, EACH ONE

46:10.766 --> 46:14.100
HAS TO COME WITH A LITTLE NOTE

46:14.166 --> 46:16.266
FROM US TO THEM THAT SAYS.

46:16.333 --> 46:17.066
"SORRY

46:17.133 --> 46:17.866
ABOUT THE WHOLE TRUMP THING.

46:17.933 --> 46:19.000
THIS ONE'S ON THE HOUSE.

46:19.066 --> 46:23.900
LOVE, AMERICA."

46:23.966 --> 46:25.333
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

46:25.400 --> 46:26.466
NOT A BAD IDEA.

46:26.533 --> 46:28.633
NEW RULE: SOMEONE MUST EXPLAIN

46:28.700 --> 46:29.600
WHY MAKING ANIMALS WITH PAPER IS

46:29.666 --> 46:30.500
CALLED "ORIGAMI" - BUT MAKING

46:30.566 --> 46:31.400
ANIMALS WITH BALLOONS - IS

46:31.466 --> 46:38.833
CALLED "SAD."

46:38.900 --> 46:39.100
[LAUGHTER]

46:39.166 --> 46:41.566
[APPLAUSE]

46:41.633 --> 46:43.633
IT'S NOT FAIR.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.966
BALLOON ANIMALS REQUIRE MORE

46:45.033 --> 46:45.333
SKILL.

46:45.400 --> 46:46.233
BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE MAKING ONE,

46:46.300 --> 46:47.266
YOU HAVE THE ADDED PRESSURE OF A

46:47.333 --> 46:48.133
BUNCH OF KIDS AT A BIRTHDAY

46:48.200 --> 46:49.033
PARTY MUTTERING, "WOW, THIS

46:49.100 --> 46:56.600
CLOWN SUCKS."

46:56.666 --> 46:56.866
[LAUGHTER]

46:56.933 --> 46:57.633
[APPLAUSE]

46:57.700 --> 46:58.433
NEW RULE: NOW THAT AMERICA HAS

46:58.500 --> 47:00.733
BEEN SWEPT WITH NOMADLAND FEVER,

47:00.800 --> 47:04.766
LET'S MAKE IT A TV SHOW.

47:04.833 --> 47:06.166
MOVE OVER THAT GIRL, MARY TYLER

47:06.233 --> 47:07.533
MOORE AND ALICE, THERE'S A NEW

47:07.600 --> 47:08.666
GIRL IN TOWN, AND SHE'S SHITTING

47:08.733 --> 47:16.033
IN A BUCKET.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.133
[LAUGHTER]

47:17.200 --> 47:18.766
[APPLAUSE]

47:18.833 --> 47:20.333
NOW, THE NETWORK HAS JUST A FEW

47:20.400 --> 47:22.533
NOTES: WE LOVE THAT SHE DRIFTS

47:22.600 --> 47:23.166
AROUND IN A VAN, BUT CAN SHE BE

47:23.233 --> 47:27.666
NINETEEN AND HOT?

47:27.733 --> 47:27.933
[LAUGHTER]

47:28.000 --> 47:29.500
MAYBE GIVE HER A DIFFERENT

47:29.566 --> 47:30.200
SUPPORTING CAST - A HANDSOME

47:30.266 --> 47:31.133
GUY, A FUNNY GUY, A LESBIAN BEST

47:31.200 --> 47:34.400
FRIEND, AND A DOG.

47:34.466 --> 47:35.266
THEY COULD SOLVE MYSTERIES!

47:35.333 --> 47:43.933
CALL ME!

47:44.000 --> 47:44.200
[LAUGHTER]

47:44.266 --> 47:44.633
[APPLAUSE]

47:44.700 --> 47:45.533
NEW RULE: I'VE BEEN A

47:45.600 --> 47:46.333
HETEROSEXUAL FOR A LONG TIME, SO

47:46.400 --> 47:47.266
SOMEONE HAS TO TELL ME WHAT I

47:47.333 --> 47:53.500
DON'T GET ABOUT MUD WRESTLING.

47:53.566 --> 47:53.766
[LAUGHTER]

47:53.833 --> 47:54.500
WHEN I SEE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, I

47:54.566 --> 47:55.766
NEVER THINK: "MAN, I'D LOVE TO

47:55.833 --> 47:56.400
SEE HER PUNCH HER ROOMMATE IN A

47:56.466 --> 48:05.100
SWAMP."

48:05.166 --> 48:06.100
[LAUGHTER]

48:06.166 --> 48:06.366
[APPLAUSE]

48:06.433 --> 48:07.400
IT'S THE EROTIC EQUIVALENT OF

48:07.466 --> 48:09.600
ICE FISHING.

48:09.666 --> 48:10.900
SOMEONE MUST LIKE IT, JUST NO

48:10.966 --> 48:16.666
ONE I'VE EVER MET.

48:16.733 --> 48:16.933
[LAUGHTER]

48:17.000 --> 48:17.833
NEW RULE: SOMEONE MUST ASK THE

48:17.900 --> 48:19.200
KID WHOSE SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT

48:19.266 --> 48:21.033
WAS TO SMEAR LIPSTICK ON A CAT'S

48:21.100 --> 48:22.333
BUTT TO SEE HOW MUCH OF THE

48:22.400 --> 48:23.600
SURFACES IN THE HOUSE CAME INTO

48:23.666 --> 48:31.900
CONTACT WITH THE CAT'S ANUS.

48:31.966 --> 48:35.733
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?

48:35.800 --> 48:37.300
AND DID YOU TELL MOM WHAT YOU

48:37.366 --> 48:38.533
DID WITH HER LIPSTICK BEFORE YOU

48:38.600 --> 48:45.500
PUT IT BACK IN HER PURSE?

48:45.566 --> 48:48.066
[LAUGHTER]

48:48.133 --> 48:49.866
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:49.933 --> 48:50.066
WHAT?

48:50.133 --> 48:52.166
WE ARE JUST HERE.

48:52.233 --> 48:53.000
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

48:53.066 --> 48:53.966
NOTHING WITH "CRYPTO" IN THE

48:54.033 --> 48:55.800
TITLE EVER TURNS OUT GOOD.

48:55.866 --> 48:57.800
THERE'S A MANIA RISING IN THE

48:57.866 --> 48:59.000
COUNTRY THESE DAYS ABOUT

48:59.066 --> 49:00.566
CRYPTOCURRENCY, AND HOW THE

49:00.633 --> 49:01.733
TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION, SO

49:01.800 --> 49:03.266
YOU BETTER GET ON.

49:03.333 --> 49:05.700
TESLA HAS JUMPED IN WITH BOTH

49:05.766 --> 49:06.433
FEET, AND MICROSOFT ACCEPTS IT

49:06.500 --> 49:10.466
FOR SOFTWARE NOW.

49:10.533 --> 49:11.766
ETSY ACCEPTS IT NOW AND SO DOES

49:11.833 --> 49:14.833
PAYPAL AND STARBUCKS AND WHOLE

49:14.900 --> 49:15.466
FOODS AND HOME DEPOT.

49:15.533 --> 49:18.366
ONE IN TEN AMERICANS USED THEIR

49:18.433 --> 49:19.366
STIMULUS CHECKS TO INVEST IN ONE

49:19.433 --> 49:21.700
OF THOUSANDS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES

49:21.766 --> 49:22.600
IN EXISTENCE, BITCOIN BEING THE

49:22.666 --> 49:24.466
MOST FAMOUS.

49:24.533 --> 49:25.866
BUT THERE'S ALSO ETHEREUM,

49:25.933 --> 49:27.200
BINANCE, TETHER, AND EVEN ONE

49:27.266 --> 49:33.266
CALLED CUMROCKET.

49:33.333 --> 49:33.533
[LAUGHTER]

49:33.600 --> 49:34.666
THERE'S ALSO ONE CALLED DOGECOIN

49:34.733 --> 49:42.566
THAT SOMEONE STARTED "AS A

49:42.633 --> 49:44.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:44.166 --> 49:44.300
JOKE,'

49:44.366 --> 49:45.066
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

49:45.133 --> 49:45.933
IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS ALL THE

49:46.000 --> 49:46.566
OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES, BECAUSE

49:46.633 --> 49:54.333
THE WHOLE THING IS A JOKE.

49:54.400 --> 49:54.800
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

49:54.866 --> 49:55.933
I UNDERSTAND THAT OUR FINANCIAL

49:56.000 --> 49:57.133
SYSTEM ISN'T PERFECT BUT AT

49:57.200 --> 49:58.733
LEAST IT'S REAL.

49:58.800 --> 49:59.733
APPLE STOCK IS WORTH MONEY

49:59.800 --> 50:01.733
BECAUSE APPLE MAKES

50:01.800 --> 50:02.633
THOUSAND-DOLLAR PHONES THAT

50:02.700 --> 50:03.466
EVERYONE BUYS AND THEN DROPS IN

50:03.533 --> 50:08.966
THE TOILET.

50:09.033 --> 50:09.233
[LAUGHTER]

50:09.300 --> 50:10.166
BUT DOGECOIN RECENTLY RALLIED TO

50:10.233 --> 50:12.700
BE WORTH MORE THAN THE MARKET

50:12.766 --> 50:14.800
CAP OF FORD AND KRAFT FOODS AND

50:14.866 --> 50:16.633
IT HAS NO PRODUCT AND NO WORKERS

50:16.700 --> 50:17.400
- IT'S JUST EASTER BUNNY CARTOON

50:17.466 --> 50:20.133
CASH.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.433
I'VE READ ARTICLES ABOUT

50:21.500 --> 50:22.533
CRYPTOCURRENCY, HAD IT EXPLAINED

50:22.600 --> 50:26.833
TO ME, AND I STILL DON'T GET IT

50:26.900 --> 50:27.433
- AND NEITHER DO YOU OR ANYONE

50:27.500 --> 50:37.300
ELSE.

50:37.366 --> 50:38.066
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

50:38.133 --> 50:39.100
I'LL EXPLAIN WHY: SO THERE'S

50:39.166 --> 50:43.533
THESE THINGS CALLED "NERDS."

50:43.600 --> 50:43.800
[LAUGHTER]

50:43.866 --> 50:44.900
AND IN 2008, ONE OF THEM - WE

50:44.966 --> 50:46.133
DON'T KNOW WHO, BECAUSE THIS

50:46.200 --> 50:47.300
PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS IS

50:47.366 --> 50:48.800
STILL ANONYMOUS - MADE UP

50:48.866 --> 50:51.733
BITCOIN OUT OF THIN AIR USING

50:51.800 --> 50:54.266
THE FAKE NAME SATOSHI NAKAMOTO,

50:54.333 --> 50:55.133
WHICH I THINK ARE THE JAPANESE

50:55.200 --> 51:02.866
WORDS FOR "MONOPOLY MONEY."

51:02.933 --> 51:03.866
[LAUGHTER]

51:03.933 --> 51:04.133
[APPLAUSE]

51:04.200 --> 51:05.300
NOW, CAPITALISM, OF COURSE, HAS

51:05.366 --> 51:07.100
ALWAYS CONTAINED AN ELEMENT

51:07.166 --> 51:08.900
WHERE, INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY

51:08.966 --> 51:10.533
MAKING SOMETHING OR PROVIDING A

51:10.600 --> 51:12.100
SERVICE FOR MONEY, YOU COULD

51:12.166 --> 51:13.233
MAKE MONEY IN THE EXCITING FIELD

51:13.300 --> 51:16.366
OF MONEY.

51:16.433 --> 51:18.166
BUT WE KNEW MONEY HAD TO

51:18.233 --> 51:19.833
ORIGINATE FROM AND BE GENERATED

51:19.900 --> 51:22.500
BY SOMETHING REAL SOMEWHERE - TO

51:22.566 --> 51:23.100
WHICH CRYPTOCURRENCY SAYS, "NO

51:23.166 --> 51:28.933
IT DOESN'T."

51:29.000 --> 51:29.200
[LAUGHTER]

51:29.266 --> 51:30.200
MAYBE THIS IS WHY WARREN BUFFET

51:30.266 --> 51:31.266
SAYS "CRYPTOCURRENCIES BASICALLY

51:31.333 --> 51:31.866
HAVE NO VALUE AND THEY DON'T

51:31.933 --> 51:33.600
PRODUCE ANYTHING.

51:33.666 --> 51:35.466
WHAT YOU HOPE IS THAT SOMEBODY

51:35.533 --> 51:37.100
ELSE COMES ALONG AND PAYS YOU

51:37.166 --> 51:39.566
MORE MONEY FOR THEM LATER ON,

51:39.633 --> 51:40.633
BUT THEN THAT PERSON'S GOT THE

51:40.700 --> 51:41.700
PROBLEM.

51:41.766 --> 51:48.566
IN TERMS OF VALUE: ZERO."

51:48.633 --> 51:50.233
[APPLAUSE]

51:50.300 --> 51:51.600
OR AS ANOTHER ANALYST PUT IT,

51:51.666 --> 51:54.166
IT'S "AN OPEN PONZI SCHEME."

51:54.233 --> 51:56.233
IT'S LIKE HAVING AN IMAGINARY

51:56.300 --> 52:02.233
BEST FRIEND WHO'S ALSO A BANKER.

52:02.300 --> 52:02.500
[LAUGHTER]

52:02.566 --> 52:04.733
THIS IS HOW THE WORLD ECONOMY

52:04.800 --> 52:06.166
CRASHED IN 2009 - IT WASN'T THE

52:06.233 --> 52:07.566
LOST VALUE IN ACTUAL HOUSES THAT

52:07.633 --> 52:10.400
SUNK US, IT WAS THIS "VIRTUAL

52:10.466 --> 52:11.666
MARKET" THAT REQUIRED INVENTING

52:11.733 --> 52:13.800
ALGORITHMS TO BET ON HOW MUCH

52:13.866 --> 52:14.866
HOUSES MIGHT BE WORTH IN A

52:14.933 --> 52:17.500
VIRTUAL SCENARIO.

52:17.566 --> 52:19.300
BUT THEN THE LANDLORD CALLED IN

52:19.366 --> 52:21.033
THE BILL FOR THIS VIRTUAL

52:21.100 --> 52:22.500
MARKET, BECAUSE, IN ADULT LAND,

52:22.566 --> 52:23.333
IT TURNS OUT THE LANDLORD IS

52:23.400 --> 52:32.433
ALWAYS REAL.

52:32.500 --> 52:33.900
[APPLAUSE]

52:33.966 --> 52:34.900
OUR PROBLEM HERE IS AT ROOT NOT

52:34.966 --> 52:37.833
ECONOMIC BUT PSYCHOLOGICAL:

52:37.900 --> 52:39.200
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN RAISED IN A

52:39.266 --> 52:40.700
VIRTUAL WORLD ARE STARTING TO

52:40.766 --> 52:43.333
BELIEVE THEY CAN REALLY LIVE IN

52:43.400 --> 52:47.900
IT.

52:47.966 --> 52:49.266
[APPLAUSE]

52:49.333 --> 52:51.666
MUCH OF WARFARE IS A VIDEO GAME

52:51.733 --> 52:53.066
NOW, WHY NOT BASE OUR ECONOMY

52:53.133 --> 52:55.100
THE SAME WAY?

52:55.166 --> 52:56.933
AND CRYPTOCURRENCY IS LITERALLY

52:57.000 --> 52:58.933
A GAME.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.400
BITCOINS ARE CREATED BY WHAT

53:02.466 --> 53:04.466
THEY CALL "MINING" - BUT NOT THE

53:04.533 --> 53:05.300
KIND OF MINING THAT'S DONE BY

53:05.366 --> 53:12.533
SEVEN DWARFS WHO SHARE A WOMAN.

53:12.600 --> 53:12.800
[LAUGHTER]

53:12.866 --> 53:14.266
THIS KIND OF MINING INVOLVES

53:14.333 --> 53:15.366
USING ROOMS FULL OF

53:15.433 --> 53:17.366
SUPERCOMPUTERS TO MAKE SOMETHING

53:17.433 --> 53:20.066
THAT IS PURPOSEFULLY ARBITRARY:

53:20.133 --> 53:21.866
ESSENTIALLY, ONE COMPUTER THINKS

53:21.933 --> 53:23.633
OF A NUMBER BETWEEN ONE AND

53:23.700 --> 53:24.633
INFINITY AND OTHER COMPUTERS

53:24.700 --> 53:26.900
TAKE TRILLIONS OF GUESSES AT

53:26.966 --> 53:27.766
WHAT IT IS.

53:27.833 --> 53:28.833
IT'S THE OLD GAME OF "I'M

53:28.900 --> 53:30.066
THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN ONE

53:30.133 --> 53:31.833
AND TEN" EXCEPT TIMES A

53:31.900 --> 53:34.566
GAZILLION, AND THE GUY GUESSING

53:34.633 --> 53:35.233
THE NUMBER LIVES IN CHINA AND

53:35.300 --> 53:36.300
THE GUY WHO KNOWS THE NUMBER

53:36.366 --> 53:43.500
LIVES IN THE MATRIX.

53:43.566 --> 53:47.100
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

53:47.166 --> 53:49.900
TAKE THAT, WORK.

53:49.966 --> 53:52.366
DO I NEED TO SPELL THIS OUT?

53:52.433 --> 53:54.333
THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY NOT

53:54.400 --> 53:56.233
CREDIBLE ABOUT CREATING HUNDREDS

53:56.300 --> 53:57.866
OF BILLIONS IN VIRTUAL WEALTH

53:57.933 --> 53:59.200
WITH NOTHING EVER ACTUALLY BEING

53:59.266 --> 54:00.433
ACCOMPLISHED AND NO ACTUAL

54:00.500 --> 54:01.400
PRODUCT MADE OR SERVICE

54:01.466 --> 54:03.733
RENDERED.

54:03.800 --> 54:06.066
IT'S LIKE TINKERBELL'S LIGHT -

54:06.133 --> 54:07.266
ITS POWER SOURCE IS BASED SOLELY

54:07.333 --> 54:07.966
ON ENOUGH CHILDREN BELIEVING IN

54:08.033 --> 54:20.133
IT.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.800
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

54:21.866 --> 54:22.933
UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT IS REAL IS

54:23.000 --> 54:23.466
THE UNFATHOMABLE AMOUNT OF

54:23.533 --> 54:24.700
ELECTRICITY THAT THOSE MASSIVE

54:24.766 --> 54:25.700
SUPERCOMPUTERS SUCK UP FOR THEIR

54:38.933 --> 54:40.300
ALL THE ELECTRICITY NEEDED TO

54:40.366 --> 54:42.133
LIGHT ALL OF NEW YORK STATE -
