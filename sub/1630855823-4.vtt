00:40.373 --> 00:43.626
This is all because of you, fucker.

It's his first time.

Take your time and try again.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.511
Aim right, motherfucker.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.472

00:57.432 --> 00:58.683
Hey!

00:58.767 --> 01:01.644
Are you fucking missing
on accident or on purpose?

01:11.946 --> 01:12.947

MAN: Kwon Seungho graduated from Chudong
Elementary School, which closed in 1984.

02:47.792 --> 02:51.254
He went to Sangun Middle School,
which closed in 1987,

02:51.337 --> 02:53.173
so there aren't any alumni groups.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.883
As for Gwangju Jeil High School,

02:54.966 --> 02:58.595
he dropped out, so his name
isn't in the student records.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.263
Interesting.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.890
Nothing can be verified.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.892
Well, I guess so.

03:17.864 --> 03:21.701
The girl you ran into, Yu Euijeong...

03:23.161 --> 03:25.079
You said she's with SMPA, right?

03:25.705 --> 03:27.540
She's in the Security Division.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.542
What would they look into us for?

03:29.626 --> 03:33.213
Well, that's what she said.

03:33.296 --> 03:37.050
And who's someone she knows? Seungho.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.178
What if she's using him to spy on us?

03:40.261 --> 03:41.763
Then according to you, shit...

03:41.846 --> 03:43.806
we'd already be in prison for murder.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.476
-Am I wrong?
-His father really was a drug addict.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.895
That's why the two met.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.606
So you're leaning toward
that idea, right?

03:51.689 --> 03:54.943
And the Busan guys leaving this behind
was a coincidence too?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.820
Look, Boss.
Ever since Kwon Seungho appeared,

03:58.029 --> 04:01.658
a cop named Yu Euijeong showed up,
and this thing popped up.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.744
And when we were attacked,
he showed up at the perfect time

04:04.827 --> 04:06.162
and took care of things.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.998
-Don't you think that's strange?
-Hey.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.168
He ran into them by coincidence
while on patrol with Yongdae.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
See? By coincidence again.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.882
If there are too many coincidences,
shouldn't you be suspicious?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.760

do you want us to do?

04:45.910 --> 04:47.203
You can't go out tonight.

04:47.578 --> 04:48.705
Why not?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.331
JONGRYEOL: What?

04:54.627 --> 04:55.712
What did you say?

04:59.215 --> 05:02.135
(SIGHS) Nothing, sir.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.637
Understood.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.535
Hey.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.750
Shit, you've been drinking?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.171
Why couldn't you shoot?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.094
I'm sorry.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.306
Hey.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.184
It's okay. You did great.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.900
Just to be sure, though...

05:58.983 --> 06:01.569
You're not going to call the police

06:01.652 --> 06:03.821
because of guilt or some shit, right?

06:03.905 --> 06:05.782
Call the police? Me?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.911
I mean, you're friends
with that policewoman.

06:09.994 --> 06:14.499
I thought maybe you were
going to call her and cry.

06:14.874 --> 06:19.087
"Hey, those bastards told me
to kill someone."

06:19.504 --> 06:22.382
Sir, please stop.
I don't want to hear it.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.926
You think you have a choice, you fuck?

06:25.426 --> 06:26.552
Look.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.182
To wear gold watches on this wrist
instead of handcuffs,

06:31.265 --> 06:33.684
I've been racking my brain
my whole fucking life.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.064
So you're Taeho's cousin. I get it.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.611
But you're not one of us.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.075
What do you mean "one of us"?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.621
What? Is it because I'm not from Gangnam?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.207

07:04.006 --> 07:05.508
Oh, boy.

Hey, Kwon Seungho.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.109

07:25.945 --> 07:27.613
I'm not from Gangnam either.

CHANGSIK: If we arrest them for this,

07:39.625 --> 07:41.461

Let's just identify the victim

07:44.422 --> 07:45.840
and keep this quiet for now.

DOHYUNG: But didn't Detective Park
cause a huge disturbance among them?

11:25.768 --> 11:27.937
Why is Euijeong meeting Jung Gicheul?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.689
Your wife is helping us.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.148
With what?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.359
She's going to tell Jung Gicheul

11:33.901 --> 11:37.071
that he can trust Kwon Seungho
and it's okay to keep him close.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.698
Why does Euijeong have to...

11:40.241 --> 11:42.743
This investigation we're doing
is dangerous.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.954
Why drag Euijeong into this?

11:45.037 --> 11:46.580
This isn't right.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.708
She agreed to do this.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.501
-Dohyung.
-Listen.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.795
We didn't ask your wife to do this.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.506
We asked
the talented Inspector Yu Euijeong

11:55.589 --> 11:57.508
of SMPA's Security Division for help.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.639

we can rely on Inspector Yu.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.401
How did you know my mom was ill?

12:15.484 --> 12:16.986
I know a guy with the police.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.532
When I ran into you that day,

12:22.908 --> 12:24.827
it was so unexpected,
and I was rude.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.245
No, you weren't.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.875
By the way, you've become
even more handsome.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.046
Ta-da.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.011
You still have this?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.556

If you find something nice
at the church shop,

13:08.329 --> 13:09.497
get one for me too.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.707
I'll get you something even better.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.167
Something more expensive.

13:13.417 --> 13:14.752
When?

13:19.423 --> 13:20.591
-Hold on.
-What's wrong?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.985
What do you think
would've happened to us

13:40.069 --> 13:41.403
if it wasn't for my mother?

13:52.790 --> 13:54.416
I hope you're being nice to Seungho.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.423
He's been through a lot
since he was a kid.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.092
Please take good care of him.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.478
It must be hard
taking care of your mother.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.980
It's okay.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.858
I'll try to stop by whenever I'm free.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.193
Thanks, but it's really fine.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.695
You're busy too.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.995
By the way, does your husband
ever visit your mother?

14:32.746 --> 14:37.167
The caregiver thought
that I was her son-in-law.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.094
If he brings up your husband,

14:47.177 --> 14:48.512
just say you had a divorce

14:49.597 --> 14:51.473
and end it there.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
Actually, I got divorced.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.650
But only some of my family know about it.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.736
Everyone I know is a cop,

15:03.819 --> 15:06.572
so I was afraid it'd spread
and cause a mess.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.992
I didn't even tell my mom either.

15:15.414 --> 15:18.042
Well, things happen in life.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.085
It's okay.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.345
GICHEUL: Did you know Euijeong
had a divorce?

15:29.428 --> 15:30.471
No, I didn't.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.850
Don't tell the others I met Euijeong.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.562
We've known her
since we were young, so we're fine.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.482
But it'll bother the other guys.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.400
She's a cop, after all.

-(ELEVATOR DINGS)
-Yes, Boss.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.198

16:03.629 --> 16:05.756
And I think I'll see her often
from now on,

16:06.465 --> 16:07.675
so keep that in mind.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.136

19:03.225 --> 19:05.394
and I think you should go by yourself.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.023
I think it'll look better to go in alone

19:10.107 --> 19:11.608
to comfort Euijeong.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.903
I can pay my respects
on my own later.

-Hello.

I didn't even contact you.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.604
I told you. I know someone
with the police.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.917
and housewarming party.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.252
But I haven't met you before.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.185
Seeing that you came immediately,

23:15.602 --> 23:17.604
you must be a really close friend.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.066
I visited her mother
at the hospital a few days ago.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.652
And she told me

23:25.070 --> 23:29.032
she liked her son-in-law
more than her two sons.

23:33.495 --> 23:36.206
When was the last time
you visited her in the hospital?

23:38.208 --> 23:41.211
I know you're divorced,
but did it ever cross your mind

23:41.294 --> 23:44.339
that she wanted to see her son-in-law
before she passed away?

23:51.888 --> 23:54.307
Honestly, do you even have
the right to mourn?

23:55.016 --> 23:56.017
Gicheul, stop.

23:58.311 --> 23:59.312
Hey.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.024
You don't talk about
another family's business,

24:03.108 --> 24:05.110
especially if it's the grieving family.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.778
You should stop too.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.415
Guests are still coming,
so wrap it up and come back in.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.520
I'll get going.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.647
Thanks for coming.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.442
You too, Seungho.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.114
I'll pray a lot for your mother.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.706
If things get tough, call me anytime.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.991
I'm going to use the restroom.

25:48.463 --> 25:49.464
Junmo.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.007
Hey, Junmo!

25:52.676 --> 25:54.261
Why didn't you report to us?

25:57.681 --> 26:01.977
I should at least pay my last respects
to my mother-in-law.

26:08.650 --> 26:11.820
Do you want to give up
on our operation here?

26:15.574 --> 26:16.866
I'm really sorry, Junmo.

26:17.826 --> 26:18.827
I will...

26:20.328 --> 26:22.622
I will stay until she's laid to rest.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.082
God damn it.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.835
-I'm really sorry.
-(STRANGLED SOB)

27:06.249 --> 27:08.335
Does the food taste all right?

27:08.960 --> 27:13.131
Yes, ma'am. It's delicious.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.133
(CHUCKLES)

27:17.052 --> 27:18.345
How's work?

27:18.637 --> 27:24.100
It's good. I'm just trying to do my best.

27:25.518 --> 27:29.022
Of course, you should.
Be confident.

27:29.105 --> 27:31.024
-I will.
-Do what you have to do...

27:31.107 --> 27:32.567
-Yes.
-...and what you want to do.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.735
Yes, ma'am.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.529
Euijeong's father and brothers disapprove,

27:36.613 --> 27:38.114
but don't worry about it.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.997
Euijeong really likes you, Junmo.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.042
And I like seeing you smile.

27:49.709 --> 27:51.586
That's what's important, right?

27:53.588 --> 27:56.800
(BOTH LAUGH)

27:57.509 --> 28:00.220
As we share laughs and time together,

28:00.303 --> 28:01.805
we'll become family.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.391
Yes.

28:04.474 --> 28:05.600
Thank you.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.066
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

28:13.566 --> 28:14.734
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

28:43.346 --> 28:47.058
Seungho, do you keep up
with how your mother's doing?

28:51.354 --> 28:52.355
Yes.

28:53.606 --> 28:58.361
I heard she had a baby
with some dude,

28:59.821 --> 29:01.573
and she's living a happy life.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.453
You don't resent her
for not looking for you?

29:06.536 --> 29:07.537
Resent her?

29:08.288 --> 29:09.581
I'm not sure.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.418
Even if it was me,

29:15.336 --> 29:18.214
I would've hated
to even think about our family.

29:24.721 --> 29:25.722
Damn it.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.853
My father would beat my mother so much.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.275
So in high school, I ran away from home
with my sibling and mother.

29:39.360 --> 29:41.571
I said I'd kill him
if he tried to find us.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.618
But that asshole...

29:49.037 --> 29:50.580
he came looking with no fear.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.419
So he was killed.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.177
Not by me. By my mother.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.607
Boss.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.488
I want to be successful.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.367
At first,

30:28.076 --> 30:31.037
I came to work for you
just to get revenge for Taeho.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
But now,

30:37.544 --> 30:39.963
I want to be successful like you.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.800
I don't want to live
as a drug addict's son.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.510
Hear me?

30:45.593 --> 30:46.886
In Gangnam...

30:48.179 --> 30:50.056
The man who made it in Gangnam,

30:52.892 --> 30:54.310
Kwon Seungho.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.606
That's who I want to be.

31:09.784 --> 31:10.827
I'll help you.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.580
Please help me, Boss.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.167
But you have to do something for me.

31:18.251 --> 31:22.255
Sure, I'll do anything.

31:22.338 --> 31:23.339
What is it?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.845
To make sure things
work out with Euijeong,

31:30.013 --> 31:31.639
I need your help.

31:33.349 --> 31:34.350
And your support.

32:06.716 --> 32:10.011
Okay, sir. I will.

32:15.224 --> 32:16.225
I'll help you.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.945
Boss.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.321
You see,

32:29.322 --> 32:32.158
I'd ride on boats
in the Pacific for a year at a time.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.953
But it's felt a bit stifling,

32:35.912 --> 32:37.622
and I miss the smell of the ocean.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.585
When you go on your next fishing trip,

32:45.213 --> 32:46.923
could you take me with you?

32:47.256 --> 32:48.883
Just like that photo over there,

32:49.801 --> 32:52.428
I want to go fishing with you.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.686
It's a hobby for us three at the top.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.689
And you already want to join?

33:06.943 --> 33:07.944
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

33:09.862 --> 33:12.907
Well, why not?

33:13.157 --> 33:14.158
Well...

33:15.159 --> 33:17.620
Didn't Euijeong ask you
to take good care of me?

33:21.249 --> 33:22.875
Please let me join you.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.634
We'll play it by ear.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.223
Okay, Boss.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.734
Thank you, sir.

33:55.116 --> 33:56.117
Boss.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.287
I'll do my best.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.924
AUTOMATED VOICE: To call, press one.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.092
To leave a message,

34:13.176 --> 34:14.969
press two.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.181
-Please, leave your message.
-(PHONE BEEPS)

34:19.057 --> 34:20.308
Hey, Euijeong.

34:24.562 --> 34:25.563
It's me.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.985
Euijeong, I'm so sorry.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.573
I'm so sorry I couldn't visit your mother.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.247
I'm just...

34:45.458 --> 34:49.212
I'm so sorry for causing such a mess.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.812
And I'm sorry for being so foolish.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.524
And...

35:13.319 --> 35:15.113
And I'm just...

35:17.073 --> 35:18.991
I'm sorry I'm not good enough.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.503
I'm just sorry for everything.

35:35.216 --> 35:36.384
I'm sorry.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.430
Euijeong.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.064
I love you.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.289
Anyone got a lighter?

36:25.892 --> 36:27.143
I'm good, sir.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.277
It's hard, isn't it?

36:36.903 --> 36:39.071
You always have to follow Boss's schedule,

36:39.864 --> 36:43.409
and at night, you don't have a store
of your own to hang out in.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.703
It's okay, sir.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.664
Don't worry.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.874
Around next spring,

36:49.957 --> 36:52.418
Boss will probably give you
a store to run.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.961
Thank you, sir.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.925
You look cute when you smile.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.802
-Seungho.
-Yes, sir?

37:02.386 --> 37:03.471
I'm younger than you,

37:03.554 --> 37:06.057
but doesn't it bother you
that I speak casually?

37:07.350 --> 37:08.851
No. It's okay, sir.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.019
Is that so?

37:11.938 --> 37:13.940
What did you do with Boss yesterday?

37:14.523 --> 37:16.359
Where did you go?

37:18.945 --> 37:20.613
Didn't Boss tell you about it?

37:23.199 --> 37:24.367
He did.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.534
What did he say?

37:30.748 --> 37:32.541
Do I have to tell you

37:32.625 --> 37:34.418
what Boss said to me?

37:38.381 --> 37:41.592
He told me everything, so you can tell me.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.309
We went to Taeho's columbarium.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.109
(DOOR OPENS)

38:01.070 --> 38:05.241
Well, why does that have to be
such a big secret?

38:05.366 --> 38:09.495
You should always tell me
about things like that. Okay?

38:37.398 --> 38:38.649
Thank you, sir.

38:38.733 --> 38:41.360
For doing it for me the other night.

38:48.492 --> 38:53.289
I hope we can continue to get along.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.047
Choose who you follow wisely.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.051
I guess I will, sir.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.514
Since we're both not from Gangnam, right?

39:18.898 --> 39:21.609
It seemed the higher-ups had
a way of making big money.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.820
We should figure that out soon too.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.573
We should, sir.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.414
JAEGEON LOGISTICS

40:19.417 --> 40:20.960
MAN 1: Oh, I was going to fold.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.087
-Sorry.
-MAN 2: Stay focused.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.672
MAN 3: I'll raise.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.008
MAN 4: You're going bet?
You got nothing.

40:28.884 --> 40:30.177
MAN 5: I'll bet and see.

40:30.803 --> 40:31.971
Who are you?

40:32.680 --> 40:33.889
Who the hell are you?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.433
Is that Kang Geon from Busan?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.811
Hi, Geon. Did you come by yourself?

40:44.942 --> 40:46.026
What brings you here?

40:53.284 --> 40:54.743
Let's start a war together.

41:05.087 --> 41:06.088
Is that me?

41:07.131 --> 41:09.091
I've never seen this bastard before.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.176
What?

41:11.844 --> 41:14.221
I think this photo was edited.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.058
What asshole did this?

41:18.142 --> 41:22.062
What kind of crazy bastard
would dare to make such a thing?

41:22.146 --> 41:23.772
Jung Gicheul of Gangnam Union.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.026
Help me out

41:27.109 --> 41:29.111
and take Nonhyeon-dong and Yeoksam-dong.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.163
MAN: Nice.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.457
What the hell?

41:44.919 --> 41:45.920
You know me, right?

41:46.879 --> 41:47.880
We need to talk.

41:47.963 --> 41:50.090
-You fucking...
-Hey, wait.

41:50.174 --> 41:52.134
I wasn't finished talking.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.763
Have you guys eaten yet?

41:55.846 --> 41:58.182
When you play pool,
Chinese food's the best.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.147
I can buy you some.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.775
-How much?
-It's 18,000 won.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.984
-It's 18,000?
-Yes.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.111
Hold on.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.493
You're in Gangnam Cartel, aren't you?

42:17.910 --> 42:18.953
What do you want?

42:23.249 --> 42:24.625
Nice to meet you.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.091
Without any elders in the organization,

42:32.216 --> 42:34.927
everyone's around people of the same age,

42:35.010 --> 42:37.221
so that must cause a lot of conflicts.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.809
Since you're so successful,

42:41.892 --> 42:44.186
my boss wants to speak with you.

42:48.315 --> 42:50.651
You're doing well for yourself, young man.

42:50.734 --> 42:51.944
This is a nice bar.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.785
But how long do you think
you can maintain such a rich life?

43:00.244 --> 43:02.371
Imagine yourself in two, three,

43:02.871 --> 43:04.873
and even 10 years.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.418
Nothing's going to change.

43:09.211 --> 43:12.047
You'll still have to bow down
to people your age,

43:12.381 --> 43:14.341
and you'll still be looked down on.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.554
This entire gang is abnormal.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.432
It all depends on one guy,
Jung Gicheul,

43:21.515 --> 43:22.850
and his charisma.

43:24.810 --> 43:28.063
What will you do
if he gets stabbed to death one day?

43:28.147 --> 43:30.441
Our gang controls 50% of Seoul,

43:31.400 --> 43:33.819
and we're willing to take you in.

43:36.113 --> 43:40.868
We're a nationwide organization
that's rapidly expanding.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.413
You're not the only one

43:44.496 --> 43:45.748
we're trying to recruit.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.711
Even if you turn us down,
someone will take our offer and join us.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.963
So think wisely.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.634
For the time being,
all you have to do for us is

43:57.509 --> 43:59.803
checking what Jung Gicheul is up to,

44:00.888 --> 44:03.307
where he's going,
and with who.

44:04.266 --> 44:08.228
Just tell us about those things
in real time.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.030
-Fuck, I'm screwed.
-Hey.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.241
Gicheul, I need to go to the hospital now.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.827
Hyeok was sent to the ER.

44:23.911 --> 44:26.163
Fuck, they said it's vaginal bleeding.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.706
What if it hurts the baby?

44:27.790 --> 44:28.957
What are you saying?

44:29.124 --> 44:32.419
I don't think I can go fishing tomorrow.
You two go without me.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.671
-Hey...
-I'm really sorry.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.838
Hey, wait.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.091
Call us.

44:37.633 --> 44:38.884
-Fuck...
-(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

44:40.219 --> 44:44.598
Boss, I don't think
just the two of us can do it.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.102
We'll need at least one person
to keep watch at the port.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.898
Let's bring one of the guys.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.733
-We won't tell him what we're doing.
-Okay.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.902
-We'll make him wait at the port.
-Got it.

44:56.985 --> 45:00.114
I'll get Chief Seo ready then.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.615
Seungho.

45:04.618 --> 45:06.328
Come on, Boss. Don't be like this.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.997
I said we wouldn't tell him about it.

45:14.628 --> 45:16.588
Still, it's too soon for him.

45:21.301 --> 45:22.636
Jungbae.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.138
Yes, Boss.

45:24.847 --> 45:26.306
If we take Seungho with us,

45:27.599 --> 45:29.476
we'll be able to see

45:30.811 --> 45:32.229
if he brings a cop or not.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.482
All right, Boss.

45:41.864 --> 45:42.865
Kwon Seungho.

45:43.282 --> 45:44.366
-Sir?
-Did you wash up?

45:44.450 --> 45:45.451
Yes, sir.

45:45.534 --> 45:47.286
Don't drink tonight. Go to bed early.

45:47.786 --> 45:49.580
Is something up, sir?

45:50.122 --> 45:52.291
Again with the fucking questions.

45:53.917 --> 45:55.919
We're fishing tomorrow, so get ready.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.047
Yes, sir. I understand.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.022
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

47:01.485 --> 47:04.196
May I ask why we changed cars?

47:07.950 --> 47:09.868
To make sure we're not being followed?

47:19.837 --> 47:23.382
Is it even possible to to go fishing
in the middle of the night?

47:25.008 --> 47:26.718
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

47:33.517 --> 47:35.227
-Hello?
-Hi, Boss.

47:35.310 --> 47:38.605
I got a flat tire, so I'm stuck here.

47:38.689 --> 47:39.690
I apologize.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.068
Man, that skid almost killed me.

47:44.403 --> 47:47.948
I'm going to call for help.

47:49.157 --> 47:50.784
Could you go on ahead first?

47:52.160 --> 47:53.245
All right.

(HORN HONKING)

48:18.312 --> 48:19.438
What the hell?

48:19.980 --> 48:21.523
I'll let them go ahead.

48:56.391 --> 48:57.559
Fuck.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.240
-Just step on it!
-Damn it.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.437

49:48.193 --> 49:49.194
Fuck!

49:55.993 --> 49:57.119
Are you all right?

50:00.372 --> 50:02.457
What the fuck is going on?

50:03.166 --> 50:04.209
Come on. Go.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.881
Hurry! Move!
