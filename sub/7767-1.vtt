00:00.265 --> 00:02.200
The finding of this Board

00:02.240 --> 00:04.720
is that the tragic events
of last December,

00:04.760 --> 00:09.520
which led to the shooting of DI
Thursday and the arrest of DS Morse

00:09.560 --> 00:12.134
were due solely
to a mental breakdown

00:12.160 --> 00:15.240
suffered by ACC Clive Deare.

00:15.280 --> 00:18.160
We are also of a view
that further investigation

00:18.200 --> 00:20.520
into other, extraneous, matters

00:20.560 --> 00:23.000
would not be
in the national interest.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.840
To which end,
all investigative materials

00:25.880 --> 00:31.360
relating to Blenheim Vale Boy's
Home are to be sealed for 50 years.

'Donald Campbell's heroic attempt at
the speed record on Coniston Water

01:08.720 --> 01:10.720
ended in tragedy.'

01:19.520 --> 01:22.000
Upstairs. All change.

02:18.120 --> 02:22.320
I require assistance
of beautiful lady?

02:23.440 --> 02:25.400
Me?

02:25.440 --> 02:27.480
A very brave gentleman?

02:55.280 --> 02:57.240
Get off me.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.400
Jeanie, come on.

03:00.440 --> 03:03.840
Can we not talk?
No, we can't.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.240
Jeannie!

03:39.040 --> 03:41.000
What was all that?

03:41.040 --> 03:42.880
Oh, frog in my throat. That's all.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.000
Bullet in your chest more like.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.360
Come on. Don't fuss.
Fuss?!

03:47.400 --> 03:49.280
You weren't due back until Tuesday.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.000
It's work I'm off to.
Not the Front.

03:51.040 --> 03:53.040
You said that last time.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.000
Here.
What's that?

03:55.040 --> 03:56.840
That's for the fair?

03:56.880 --> 03:58.560
Win us all a goldfish.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.720
Now let me say
cheerio to your mother.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.320
Here.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.360
If you're going.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.200
Where is it we're going?

04:13.240 --> 04:15.000
About 12 miles out.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.040
The woods by Lake Silence.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.760
Have you seen him?

04:23.200 --> 04:25.360
Not since he got out.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.040
No-one has.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.080
I wasn't sure who it was.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.400
Hello, Morse.
What happened there?

05:06.440 --> 05:09.840
Oh, damn! Bloody pheasant.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.120
Thought I'd missed it.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.040
How are you getting on?

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
Oh, you know?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.360
I thought you might fancy a drive.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.440
Take you out of yourself.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.400
Really. Where?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.240
Surprise.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
Best bib and tucker.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.560
How are you?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.560
Right now it's not the state
of my health concerns me.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.080
Dead about eight hours.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.760
Say between one and three
this morning.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.760
But you didn't call me out here
cos she was hit by a car.

05:45.800 --> 05:51.200
No. I called you out because she was
hit by the same car... several times.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.680
Initial impact,
about 50 yards that way.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.720
There's a shoe.

05:56.760 --> 06:01.120
She's been thrown, then hit again
and dragged under the vehicle.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.360
Finally, the car's
reversed over her.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.720
Stand to.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.520
Morning, sir.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.440
Thursday. Doctor.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.480
Well...

06:16.680 --> 06:18.800
..here we all are again.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.920
Where are we going?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.440
To see some pals
on the other side of the lake.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.520
You remember Bruce?

06:30.560 --> 06:33.720
My second-cousin.
Loose-head in the Varsity match?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.400
East Indies Steamship Company,
wasn't it?

06:36.440 --> 06:39.160
The family firm.
That's right. Well remembered.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.360
So, do I 'My Lord' it or what?
Stick to Bruce.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.280
It's all terribly egalitarian
with the bluebloods these days.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.400
Even I'm Tony.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.680
What's the trouble, officer?

06:53.720 --> 06:55.680
Accident, sir. Fatal.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.360
Pretty little thing too.
Red head.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.080
Where is it you're trying to go?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.840
North side of the Lake. It's
only about two miles up the road.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.520
Take a left. I don't suppose
you could just let me through?

07:04.560 --> 07:07.800
Take a left. I know a detour.
Thank you, officer. Thank you.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.520
Just as a matter of interest, what
are you going to do with yourself?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.640
Oh, here he is.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.600
What in God's name d'you call that?

07:28.640 --> 07:30.600
Bluebell, actually.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.240
A hundred quid says
I make it to the house first.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.320
That's a hundred quid
you owe me, Tony.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.680
Bruce, you remember Morse?
I don't.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.440
Pagan!? Good God!

07:50.480 --> 07:52.200
Where the hell did Tony find you?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.680
He's at my parents' old dachas
for the summer. Is he?

07:54.720 --> 07:56.720
Is he? Well, come on in.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.480
See anything of the old gang?
Er... not much.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.360
No. You never were the clubbable
type. Always thought too much.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.400
That was your problem.
Was it?

08:09.440 --> 08:11.600
So, what have you been up to?
Oh, this and that.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.520
But not much of 'the other', eh?
Same old Pagan.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.160
Still falling for the wrong
girl too, I'll bet?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.120
Line your excuses up for lunch.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.960
I must talk business with Tony.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.960
Drinks are in the drawing room.
Just follow the music.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.800
Are you married?

09:06.840 --> 09:09.960
Er... no.
Good!

09:10.000 --> 09:13.200
I was hoping to fix Elva
up with Julius Hanbury...

09:13.240 --> 09:15.760
but look...

09:15.800 --> 09:18.040
bagged by a bloody actress!

09:18.080 --> 09:20.560
As if I care.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.320
Baronets are ten-a-penny
in Annabel's these days.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.800
Perhaps I shall throw
you two together, instead.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.640
Well, you might at least
introduce us first.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.120
Elva Piper, this is...
Morse.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.280
And I'm Kay.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.360
Champagne?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.760
Why not. Thank you.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.360
What do you do, Mr Morse?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.320
Nothing. At present.

09:46.360 --> 09:49.320
Are you one of the idle rich?
Idle, certainly.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.640
What about yourself, Miss Piper.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.760
I play a little tennis.
Don't tease.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.920
Elva just happened to win a little
trophy at the little French Open.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.640
I thought I knew
all Bruce's friends?

10:05.680 --> 10:07.600
It's Anthony I know better.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.040
Anthony Don. He brought me over.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.000
From London?
No. From just across the water.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.280
Who do you know there?

10:15.320 --> 10:17.760
Er... no-one, really.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.000
You must know Bixby.
Everyone knows Bixby.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.600
He just bought that vulgar pile.
Right on the lake.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.640
Bixby?

10:25.680 --> 10:27.680
What Bixby?

10:42.440 --> 10:44.400
It's my Jeannie,

10:44.440 --> 10:47.040
she left the kiddie with me
last night when she went out.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.760
Only she never got back.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.800
All right, Mrs. Hearne. Let's
just take it slowly. Went out where?

10:51.840 --> 10:54.240
To the fair. With some fella
from the depot.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.520
A mechanic. Albert.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.080
Which depot? Town and District.
She's a clippie. On the buses.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.920
Sorry, he's teething. Ooh!

11:04.160 --> 11:06.520
Good boy.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.560
Albert Potter?

11:11.600 --> 11:14.480
DS Jakes, City Police. DI Thursday.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.160
You got a minute?

11:16.200 --> 11:17.880
Did you see her home?

11:17.920 --> 11:21.480
No... she went on the Ghost Train
and I kind of lost her.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.280
Kind of how?

11:23.320 --> 11:25.040
Well, she wanted a toffee-apple.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.200
Only there was a queue and
when I got back, she was gone.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.760
What time was this?
Gone ten.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.280
I had a bit of a look for her,
but, I give up and went home.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.840
We should do something.
I am doing something.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.840
Beside getting drunk.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.280
Why don't I get the I Ching?
Have you done it?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.240
Er... no.
It's fantastic.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.760
It's a, kind of,
Chinese fortune telling book.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.480
Darling, I know I married a model,

11:50.520 --> 11:54.160
but you really don't have to fulfil
everyone's expectations of vacuity.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.920
For God's sake!

11:56.960 --> 11:59.520
Is he going to do that all day long?

12:00.760 --> 12:03.960
There's talk he's going to attempt
to break the speed record.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.360
He's a daredevil. He's my neighbour.
He has these parties.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.080
Bixby's a bloody chancer.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.480
Him and the rest of his
Belvedere set, so-called!

12:14.520 --> 12:16.760
Don't go on. It's so boring.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.240
What the bloody hell's
this about now?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.080
I didn't tell you, did I?

12:21.120 --> 12:23.040
We came across an accident
on the way over.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.400
Young girl got herself
more or less cut in half.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.120
Some rather toothsome redhead,
according to the constable.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.920
I can't think what they want
to come bothering us about it for.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.080
They're probably
speaking to everyone local.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.040
See if anyone knew her... I'd expect.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.600
Why don't the three of us
go into town and tie one on.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.680
There's a fair, isn't there?
On the Green. We could all go.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.320
I hate fairs.
Well, I must be on my way.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.120
Thank you for...
Tomorrow, then.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.920
We'll come and dig you out!

12:46.960 --> 12:48.960
Have some bloody fun!

13:04.960 --> 13:07.960
All right, Sir?
Will you follow me, please?

13:36.400 --> 13:39.400
All done?
All done.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.920
Like nothing ever happened.

14:11.542 --> 14:11.643
♪♪

14:15.200 --> 14:18.480
What was Jeanie Han's body
doing at Lake Silence...

14:19.520 --> 14:21.480
..if she was taken from the fair?

14:22.379 --> 14:25.259
Somewhere quiet.
Nobody about at that time of night.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.820
Very well. Carry on.
Sir.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.360
Oh, I had an inquiry from
Gerald Ashborne's parents.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.240
A student found dead in his rooms
at Carlyle College this morning.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.880
The family are keen
to have the body...

14:38.920 --> 14:41.000
unless there's anything untoward.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.080
His mother knows my wife.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.200
Flower arranging.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.880
Of course, sir. I'll chase it up.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.720
It's just you and Miss..?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.480
Brawton, Roselle. And Mr Swopes.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.320
My brother-in-law.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.760
He's a mute. His lungs.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.400
He was home on leave
when Coventry got bombed.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.880
Wonderful what the surgeons can do,
but even so.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.000
So what?
He helps you out, does he?

16:02.040 --> 16:05.440
With certain, my stage affects,
it's been hard for him to find work.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.480
People are funny!

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
Er... what's all this about?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.800
Young women found dead
by Lake silence yesterday morning.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.160
She attended the fair
Thursday night.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.960
Red head? 20s? We're just looking
to see if anybody remembers her.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.800
We don't really see any of the
punter's. They're just erm...

16:21.840 --> 16:23.480
shadows beyond the footlights.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.520
Her boyfriend said she came up and
helped out with your act. Really?

16:26.560 --> 16:29.880
You don't remember her, then?
No. I'm sorry. No.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.800
All right, thank you, Mr Newton.
That'll be all for now.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.840
Next!

16:36.880 --> 16:38.880
This way, sir.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.440
Miss Hicks?

16:57.640 --> 17:00.520
I'm only to use it
in an emergency.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.760
Any message, if I find him?

17:07.839 --> 17:10.240
I'll leave you to get on, Miss.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.640
Mr Thursday?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.079
He doesn't want to be found.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.640
No, I'm fine.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.160
Mr Morse, how are you?

18:19.480 --> 18:21.960
I can't hear you.
Oh, come. Come with me.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.000
He has a man flies around,

18:27.040 --> 18:29.880
scouring the palaces of princes
and maharajahs.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.000
Can you imagine?
The loot of the world.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.440
Humph! Some of these pieces
are priceless.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.240
Literally.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.320
Some of them are worthless.
Literally.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.040
This. It's a copy. Fake.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.560
A good one, but...
Oh, I doubt that.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.480
He's as rich as Croesus.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.360
I've seen it. The real painting
hangs in the Rijksmuseum.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.480
How do you know?

18:51.520 --> 18:53.360
Maybe this is the real one

18:53.400 --> 18:55.720
and the one in the Rijksmuseum's
is the fake.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.000
I think the curators
might have noticed.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
They might.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.040
Then again...

19:06.080 --> 19:09.040
Perhaps for your next trick you can
pull our host from that top hat

19:09.080 --> 19:11.120
and we can ask him.
Be delighted.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.760
Et voila!

19:16.800 --> 19:19.520
I'm sorry, old man. I thought
you knew. I'm Bixby.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.880
My friends call me Bix.
Morse, isn't it?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.520
Anthony said it was.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.080
Yes, you know Anthony?
He's been my guest many times.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.760
Both here and in London.
I've a place on Berkeley Square.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.800
The Belvedere. Perhaps you know it?

19:32.240 --> 19:35.000
I'm afraid there are things
to which I must attend.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.800
Do you have everything you want?

19:36.840 --> 19:40.320
Which of us can answer yes to that?
In present company, obviously.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.240
If you're free tomorrow,

19:42.280 --> 19:44.440
come and watch me put
Redtail through her paces.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.240
My hydroplane. Say about 11:00?

19:47.280 --> 19:49.880
Bix, I must speak to you...
Not now, Roddy.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.920
Harry!
Bix!

20:11.080 --> 20:13.040
How are you?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.200
Oh... you know?

20:17.320 --> 20:19.320
Liver still works.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.360
How did you find me?

20:22.720 --> 20:25.000
It was my lung got a hole in it.
Not my brain.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.160
Monica?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.240
She's worried.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.720
How long you been holed up here?

20:32.760 --> 20:34.880
Since I got out.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.160
I went to your flat.

20:37.200 --> 20:40.280
They put you in hospital
and tried to frame me for murder.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.640
I couldn't put anyone else at risk.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.680
You might tell her that.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.040
You seen the findings, then?

20:49.080 --> 20:51.440
Huh? The whitewash.
What did you expect?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.600
Better.
We broke them.

20:53.640 --> 20:57.560
The worst are gone. What's left,
scattered to the four winds.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.640
And I'm light one bag-man.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.000
Ask Jakes.
Situation's not vacant.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.840
He spoke for you.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.160
Strange, too. Mr Bright. It's over.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
Not for me.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.080
You live in the shadows
long enough,

21:12.120 --> 21:14.720
you forget the sunlight.
I'm finished with it.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.000
You didn't put your papers in.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.600
Oh, I'm still suspended,
pending inquiry.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.560
They want me gone, they can fire me.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.840
Then what? You're just gonna sit
here feeling sorry for yourself?

21:24.880 --> 21:27.200
We've got a woman disappeared
off the ghost train

21:27.240 --> 21:28.800
at the fair last night.

21:28.840 --> 21:31.680
She was found dead this morning
about three miles from here.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.920
I can't. I'm not the same.
I wouldn't be any use to you.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.920
No?
No.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.440
Well...

21:48.440 --> 21:50.400
Fair enough.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.240
Mind how you go.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.200
Why would you go back?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.480
After everything?

22:07.520 --> 22:10.360
There's a town needs looking to.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.400
That doesn't change just cos
I've dropped a suit size.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.440
Throw the towel in now, it was all
for nothing and the bastards won.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.960
I found something...
back up the road from the body.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.640
It's a scorecard from
the North Oxford Golf Club.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.920
Yesterday's date.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.840
The players' names
haven't been entered,

22:35.880 --> 22:38.320
but their handicaps
and the scores per hole.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.600
Should narrow it down.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.280
There's a Cowley
telephone number on the back.

22:44.640 --> 22:46.800
That's the best I can do.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
Good luck with it.

23:02.338 --> 23:02.439
♪♪

23:04.320 --> 23:06.560
I've spoken to the club, sir.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.480
They're running me
off a list of members

23:09.520 --> 23:11.840
who booked to play
a round on Thursday.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.640
And the telephone number?

23:13.680 --> 23:17.120
A call-box sir. Across the road
from Jeannie Hearne's house.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.960
Ah, Jakes. Any luck at the fair?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
One or two with minor form, sir.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.760
Nothing like this.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
We've been over
Jeannie Hearne's footsteps

23:25.840 --> 23:27.720
so far as Albert Potter
can remember them.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.680
And? They went on a few rides,
took in a magic show,

23:30.720 --> 23:33.800
shooting gallery...
Potter says he won her a monkey.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.200
£500?
Stuffed, sir.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.240
What?
Soft toy.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.920
Ah!

23:40.960 --> 23:43.960
No sign of it as yet, sir.
Nor her handbag.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.480
You must be mad.
Why would you risk all this?

23:48.520 --> 23:50.880
If you can make a heap
of all your winnings

23:50.920 --> 23:53.560
and risk it all in one turn
of pitch and toss...

23:56.480 --> 24:00.120
Did you hear about this dead girl
found on the lake road yesterday?

24:00.160 --> 24:02.680
A constable came by.
I don't think she was local.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.480
Staff, maybe, from one of the houses
on the north side.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.600
Er... speaking of which,

24:07.640 --> 24:11.160
Tony said you know the Belboroughs.
You must bring them over.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.240
I don't think Bruce
is your cup of tea.

24:13.280 --> 24:15.280
Lady Belborough, then.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.680
I should like to know
all my neighbours.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.480
A matter of fact, I'm having
a mask ball here tomorrow night.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.240
You should invite them.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.920
Another party!

24:23.960 --> 24:26.000
You can have too much
of a good thing, you know?

24:26.040 --> 24:27.680
Oh, can you?

24:27.720 --> 24:29.760
I can't!

24:29.800 --> 24:32.640
Tony tells me that you
were both at Oxford with him.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.520
With Belborough.
Yes. For a while.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.560
I was at Harvard myself.

24:38.600 --> 24:41.360
But all the important things
in life, I learned at the tables.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.120
You a betting man?
My father played the horses.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.480
One gambler in the family's
quiet enough.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.720
Oh, you must come to the Belvedere.
As my guest, of course.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.600
You get to know the truth
of a man at cards.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.560
And what's the truth of you?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.840
Sportsman?

24:58.880 --> 25:01.040
Gambler? Tycoon?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.560
Who's the real Joss Bixby?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.600
I wonder myself, old man.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.200
I wonder myself.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.960
Bruce?

25:24.960 --> 25:28.000
Really, old man,
it's nothing very remarkable.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.080
My parents died when I was young.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.120
My inheritance was held in trust
until I reached majority.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.000
I travelled a bit, I got to know
the stocks business.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.480
You see, The truth
of it's altogether dull.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.520
But these are my real passion!

25:40.560 --> 25:44.720
The new Klipspringer Continental.
She was delivered this morning.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.800
Why don't you take her for a spin?

25:46.840 --> 25:49.080
Ah, it's a bit too fast for me.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.240
I'd be more at home in
something like... that, maybe.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.160
She's yours.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.280
Don't be ridiculous.
You hardly know me.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.320
A gambler's instinct.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.640
You're a straight bat, old man.
I knew it as soon as I saw you.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.000
What's your line,
if you don't mind me asking?

26:05.040 --> 26:06.600
Didn't Anthony say?

26:06.640 --> 26:08.520
He said you had a bit
of trouble somewhere.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.880
But he didn't say what kind.
And I didn't press him.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.920
He was discrete.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.880
Let's just say I am
reviewing my options.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.120
Well, I could use a good corner-man.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.440
Why don't you come and work for me
while you make your mind up?

26:24.480 --> 26:27.640
Doing what, exactly? Keeping me
out of trouble, in the main.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.320
Why? Do you get much of that?

26:29.360 --> 26:31.520
Anyone who ever made a deal
made an enemy.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.640
You seem to be doing
all right so far.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.400
Luck of the draw, old man.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.680
One was damned and one was saved.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.480
The toss of a single coin!
God called it. Not me.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.320
Jesus!

26:53.360 --> 26:55.760
Bit before his time, actually.

26:55.800 --> 26:59.640
Book Of Numbers,
Chapter 32 Verse 23.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.000
'You have sinned against the Lord

27:03.040 --> 27:05.360
and be sure your sin
will find you out.'

27:11.280 --> 27:13.440
I've found something
under her nails.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.040
I've sent it for analysis.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.080
Let you have the findings
as soon as they're through.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.360
Blood results in on your 'sudden'.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.360
Under-grad Gerald Ashborne.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.160
Chinese heroin.
Number three variety.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.920
New for these parts
and rather worrying.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.720
How's that?

27:31.760 --> 27:34.360
This Chinese stuff varies
in strength enormously.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.840
Results are somewhat hit...

27:36.880 --> 27:41.000
and in the case of the late Gerald
Ashborne, a rather resounding miss.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.680
Right. Thank you, doctor.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.520
Evening, officer.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.360
Hello, matey. Last place
I'd expected to see you.

29:54.400 --> 29:56.880
I mean...
Not sure it's your colour!

29:56.920 --> 29:59.480
Bloody pickpockets, innit.
Where they dump the empties.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.240
Here, cop that.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.080
There's a few more under there.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.440
Not belonging to this dead girl,
there's not.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.600
Leopard print handbag, wasn't it?

30:07.640 --> 30:09.360
The paper said. Jeannie Hearne.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.360
Trust you! We've been tearing
the county apart looking for that.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.360
You found it, not me.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.440
Congratulations, by the way.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.360
Sergeant Strange.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.440
Yeah. Well...

30:21.560 --> 30:23.840
Like piles, eh?

30:26.640 --> 30:28.920
Any leads on this dead woman?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.800
The brains trust retraced
her route around the fair.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.760
Shooting gallery.
Magic show.

30:33.800 --> 30:35.720
Did you look at the Ghost Train?

30:35.760 --> 30:39.040
They did and err...
no sign she was ever there.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.200
No blood. Nothing.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.080
What are you doing
poking around anyway?

30:45.120 --> 30:47.840
Actually, I came to have
a go on the erm... attractions.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.120
If you say so.

30:52.320 --> 30:54.640
We were all rooting for you.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.720
And the old man.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.120
Bright had him under
24-hour armed watch.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.800
Never left his side
until he was out of the woods.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.040
How was it?

31:05.080 --> 31:08.320
'It'? Prison 'it'?

31:08.360 --> 31:10.400
How'd you think?

31:10.440 --> 31:12.720
Safest place you could have been.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.800
It didn't feel
very safe at the time.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.400
You being banged up bought us
room to get it squared away.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.480
Clear your name.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.000
Well... I'd better get this
back to the nick.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.440
I'll be seeing you.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.080
The item is...

31:35.120 --> 31:37.840
..a gentleman's wallet!

31:40.680 --> 31:44.160
And now for my next trick,

31:44.200 --> 31:47.920
I require the assistance
of a beautiful women

31:47.960 --> 31:50.960
and a very brave gentleman.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.960
Yes! Madame. You!

31:53.000 --> 31:54.880
And perhaps you, sir?

31:54.920 --> 31:56.920
If you'll be so kind.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.280
Let's give them a round of applause.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.720
It is you!
Oh.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.720
We called at the house
to pick you up.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.840
Everyone's here.
You didn't fancy the show?

32:16.880 --> 32:18.680
I told you, I don't like fairs.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.760
Besides, you've seen one trick...

32:20.800 --> 32:23.040
Come and buy me a drink.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.200
Then you can win me something.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.640
Five out of six.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.680
Five? Are you sure?

32:33.720 --> 32:37.240
I do believe he's got you, Bruce.
What's for the face card?

32:37.280 --> 32:39.360
That's the big prize.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.520
Well done, old man.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.560
Well done.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.840
A kiss was for the runner-up,
wasn't it?

32:46.880 --> 32:50.640
Oh, look, a man-eater. How apt.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.400
Keep me warm.

33:14.442 --> 33:14.543
♪♪

33:17.840 --> 33:18.879
Wotcha.

33:19.300 --> 33:21.620
Any word on
Jeannie Hearne's handbag?

33:21.660 --> 33:24.020
Oh, yeah, well done, Jim.
It's with the old man.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.500
Actually it was err...
Morse identified it!

33:27.540 --> 33:29.700
He was there, wasn't he,
at the fair?

33:29.740 --> 33:32.020
Having a poke around.
Thursday's seen him...

33:32.060 --> 33:34.500
Apparently, he's living
in some shack in the woods.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.500
Running with some posh set
by the lake over Cacklebury.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.340
Posh set?

33:39.380 --> 33:41.660
It doesn't sound like him!

33:41.700 --> 33:44.220
Prison, maybe. It changes a man.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.700
So is he coming back or what?

33:46.740 --> 33:48.980
Your guess is as good as mine.

33:49.020 --> 33:51.140
I wouldn't hold your breath!

34:47.460 --> 34:50.219
What's this?
Eat, drink and be merry?

34:50.260 --> 34:53.179
As the fella says, old man.
It's just one go around the board.

34:53.219 --> 34:55.900
Harry Rose, meet my good friend
and neighbour, Mr Morse.

34:55.940 --> 34:58.100
I want you to look after him
for me this evening.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.100
Make sure that he has a good time.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.540
Be a pleasure.
Will you excuse me, Bix?

35:04.100 --> 35:07.220
Who's that?
The man that fixed the World Cup.

35:07.260 --> 35:09.580
The trophy that went missing
last year?

35:09.620 --> 35:11.500
All that in the paper
about a dog finding it?

35:11.540 --> 35:13.180
It was Harry got it back.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.220
Made a nice bit of money
as a finder's fee too.

35:15.260 --> 35:17.580
Here's Tony.
I must leave you, old man.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.740
Someone's pushed the boat out.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.780
He's got a trial run
at the record tomorrow.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.620
Let's get a drink.

35:23.660 --> 35:26.060
Heard anything more
about this dead girl we saw?

35:26.100 --> 35:27.980
I told you, I'm out of it.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.140
Says in the papers
she went missing at the fair.

35:30.180 --> 35:31.860
It's all anyone's talking about.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.380
Found right on the doorstep,
as it were.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.260
Well, well. Mr Morse.
Back for Seconds?

35:38.620 --> 35:40.740
Now there's a turn up.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.780
Is this your doing?
No. Really?

35:47.460 --> 35:50.060
Bruce!
Ah, hello, Tony. How are you?

35:50.100 --> 35:52.500
Oh, Pagan. Hello.
Hello, darling. Kay.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.900
Bruce, may I introduce Joss Bixby?

35:59.940 --> 36:03.860
Bix, this is Lord Belborough
and his wife, Lady... Hello, Kay.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.940
You've met?

36:07.660 --> 36:10.140
Just now. On the stairs.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.940
Tony tells me a man might get
a decent game of cards around here.

36:15.980 --> 36:19.260
He might. Later... perhaps.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.140
All work, Bixby?
I'm sorry, old man?

36:26.180 --> 36:28.900
Trade. The white man's burden.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.580
If you'll excuse me a moment.

36:32.620 --> 36:36.460
You won't forget about that game
of cards, will you, old man?

36:36.500 --> 36:39.620
Bloody upstart.
He's all right.

36:39.660 --> 36:42.380
Oh, is he? Is he?
Did you hear that, Tony?

36:42.420 --> 36:44.220
Pagan says he's all right.

36:44.260 --> 36:46.300
If it's going to be bloody,
why did you come?

36:46.340 --> 36:48.380
Same reason as everybody else here.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.660
To see what all the fuss was about.

37:14.980 --> 37:19.020
You'll have to forgive my husband,
he's been drinking since...

37:19.060 --> 37:22.820
You don't have to make excuses.
Not to me. I know Bruce of old.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.620
Dance with me.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.660
Please?

37:46.380 --> 37:48.380
Is everything all right?

37:50.180 --> 37:52.900
I've been a fool. That's all.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.620
If there's anything I can do?

38:01.940 --> 38:04.180
I never should have agreed to come.

38:04.220 --> 38:06.340
Mind if I cut in, old man?

38:42.580 --> 38:44.540
Cigar?

38:44.580 --> 38:46.620
No, no thank you.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.420
They make a nice couple,
don't you think?

38:51.580 --> 38:53.980
How is it you know Bixby?

38:54.020 --> 38:57.420
He advises me on my investments
now and again.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.340
But as friends
we go back a long way.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.740
Bix's got everything,
wouldn't you say?

39:02.780 --> 39:05.540
Pretty much.
Deserves it too.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.660
Nobody more.

39:07.700 --> 39:12.060
If only he could find himself
a nice girl and settle down.

39:14.500 --> 39:18.220
Well, it's from the Belvedere,
but how this Miss Hearne came by it?

39:18.260 --> 39:20.780
Any chance she was here?

39:20.820 --> 39:22.740
Well, it's possible.

39:22.780 --> 39:25.460
Either here, or in London,
or she knew somebody who has.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.300
There must be thousands
of these chips.

39:27.340 --> 39:29.460
People hang on to them
sometimes for luck.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.940
Well, it didn't bring Miss Hearne
much of that,

39:31.980 --> 39:34.100
however she came by it.

39:34.140 --> 39:36.860
Well, unless there
was anything else, Inspector?

39:36.900 --> 39:39.020
It's a poor host
neglects his guests.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.100
Sir.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.140
Excuse me a moment, will you.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.420
Sir?

40:04.460 --> 40:06.460
What was all that?

40:06.500 --> 40:08.900
Police business.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.620
I might ask you the same.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.460
Harry Rose?
Who is he?

40:12.500 --> 40:14.260
King of the one-armed-bandits.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.980
There isn't a slot machine
in England

40:16.020 --> 40:18.380
doesn't have his dabs all over it.
He's been away.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.100
Got out on Thursday morning.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.700
The same day Jeannie Hearne
was killed?

40:22.740 --> 40:24.740
His number's in her address book...

40:25.780 --> 40:28.100
..and this was in her handbag.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.380
It's from the Belvedere.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.420
Bixby's place.

40:32.460 --> 40:34.460
Some nice company you're keeping.

40:34.500 --> 40:38.060
Oh, and Mr Bright's seen
your inquiry lifted, by the way.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.780
If you ever decide
you want to get back to work.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.980
Why does Bruce call you Pagan?

40:46.020 --> 40:48.380
Long story.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.500
It's a joke... at my expense,

40:50.540 --> 40:52.660
because I don't have
a Christian name.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.700
You must.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.780
Not one that I care to use.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.900
What does it start with?

41:01.620 --> 41:03.820
I bet I can guess.

41:05.100 --> 41:07.100
Hold out your hands.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.460
Kay?
Hold out your hands.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.020
Right.

41:13.060 --> 41:15.100
Now.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.380
Look into my eyes.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.380
A?

41:21.420 --> 41:23.180
B?

41:23.220 --> 41:25.460
C? D?

41:25.500 --> 41:27.100
E?

41:27.140 --> 41:29.220
F? E?

41:29.260 --> 41:31.300
It is, isn't it?

41:31.340 --> 41:33.420
Quite a trick.

41:33.460 --> 41:35.500
Where did you pick that up?

41:35.540 --> 41:38.460
A misspent youth.
Don't change the subject.

41:38.500 --> 41:41.140
E. E for what?

41:42.620 --> 41:44.580
Embarrassment. Mostly.

41:44.620 --> 41:46.260
It's just a name.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.780
Almost nobody in modelling
goes by their real name.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.420
'A rose by any other...'

41:55.060 --> 41:57.020
What?

41:58.380 --> 42:00.740
You remind me of someone.

42:00.780 --> 42:02.860
Good someone or bad someone?

42:04.300 --> 42:06.540
Both.

42:08.220 --> 42:11.100
Are you falling in love with me?

42:12.740 --> 42:15.020
Men do.

42:16.340 --> 42:18.540
I can see how that might happen.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.620
Then why don't you kiss me?

42:31.540 --> 42:34.380
It's Elva you're supposed
to fall for.

42:35.940 --> 42:38.740
Bruce?
Bruce doesn't give a damn.

42:38.780 --> 42:41.100
He's got a girl in town.

42:41.140 --> 42:43.180
Don't you know that?

42:43.220 --> 42:45.780
A bus conductress, of all things.

42:47.300 --> 42:49.900
Room for one more on top!

42:49.940 --> 42:53.140
There you are! Thank God.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.500
Don't 'old man' me.

42:56.540 --> 42:58.900
You could've left the table
at any time you wanted.

42:58.940 --> 43:00.620
No-one was holding a gun
to your head.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.460
I bet you could probably arrange
for that too, couldn't you?

43:03.500 --> 43:05.140
Where's Kay? We're leaving.

43:05.180 --> 43:07.660
Welch here, there won't be a table
open to you in London.

43:07.700 --> 43:10.180
You lost fair and square.
I'll lose to a straight house,

43:10.220 --> 43:12.300
Not to a crooked racket!
Keep your voice down.

43:12.340 --> 43:14.460
Oh, You want your money, don't you?

43:14.500 --> 43:19.020
All these people here can't see
what you are, but I can.

43:19.060 --> 43:20.780
And what's that, old man?

43:20.820 --> 43:22.740
A fraud.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.940
Well, sooner a fraud
than a Blackshirt's bastard.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.660
Bruce? Please.

43:27.700 --> 43:29.700
What are you? You his big pal now?

43:29.740 --> 43:31.740
Don't forget
who your real friends are.

43:31.780 --> 43:33.860
Where's my wife?

43:33.900 --> 43:36.140
You don't have to go.

43:36.180 --> 43:38.100
I'll be back.

43:43.140 --> 43:46.660
You don't have to go, that's what
Harry was getting at too.

43:46.700 --> 43:49.140
It's Kay.

43:49.180 --> 43:51.900
That's who it's about.
That's what you want.

43:51.940 --> 43:53.980
Wouldn't you?

43:55.460 --> 44:00.300
If you loved someone and lost them
and had a chance to make it right?

44:00.340 --> 44:03.660
No matter how much you want it,
you can't turn the clock back.

44:03.700 --> 44:05.700
Of course you can.

44:05.740 --> 44:08.140
Of course you can, old man.

44:08.180 --> 44:10.140
What do they say?

44:10.180 --> 44:12.060
Time is money.

44:12.100 --> 44:14.420
I'd have killed every man
in that room

44:14.460 --> 44:16.340
to live just one more hour
in her eyes.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.740
But you could have
any woman in the world.

44:23.780 --> 44:27.060
What were you doing at the fair
last night? I saw you there.

44:29.580 --> 44:33.460
I wondered if any of the sideshows
might be available for this evening.

44:34.820 --> 44:37.500
Nothing to do
with Jeannie Hearne, then?

44:37.540 --> 44:40.140
No. That's twice
I've heard that name tonight.

44:40.180 --> 44:42.980
The first person to ask
was a policeman.

44:44.900 --> 44:47.140
So's the second.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.020
Ah.

44:59.340 --> 45:01.460
I don't know her.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.220
Sorry, old man.

45:07.900 --> 45:09.860
Come on...

45:11.340 --> 45:13.500
..I need to clear my head.

45:16.940 --> 45:18.900
On a night like this...

45:20.100 --> 45:22.780
..a man might believe
anything's possible.

45:24.420 --> 45:28.620
Will you come and watch tomorrow,
when I go for the run?

45:31.100 --> 45:33.420
I've seen enough death.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.900
What do you need to prove?

45:37.580 --> 45:39.780
That I'm as good a man as Bruce.

45:40.820 --> 45:42.780
If she sees that, she might...

45:43.820 --> 45:45.780
..well, maybe she'll come back.

45:45.820 --> 45:47.860
Don't you think?

45:49.700 --> 45:51.980
Anything's possible.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.900
Good luck.

45:59.180 --> 46:01.140
You too, old man...

46:01.180 --> 46:03.460
You too.

46:59.340 --> 47:01.340
Bix?

47:01.380 --> 47:03.460
Bixby!

47:06.100 --> 47:08.540
Bixby?

47:20.721 --> 47:20.869
♪♪

47:34.660 --> 47:36.940
All right? Morse.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.980
Hmm?

47:41.340 --> 47:44.340
There was a car. I saw
its headlamps through the trees.

47:44.380 --> 47:46.660
That was around... half five.

47:46.700 --> 47:50.300
The shot came
about 20 minutes later.

47:50.340 --> 47:52.020
Did he ever mention any enemies?

47:52.060 --> 47:55.660
No, not to me, but somebody
vandalised one of his cars

47:55.700 --> 47:58.020
the other day.
Left him some kind of...

47:58.060 --> 48:00.820
I don't know... A warning.
About what?

48:00.860 --> 48:03.540
It was Old Testament stuff.

48:03.580 --> 48:07.180
"Be sure your sin
will find you out."

48:07.220 --> 48:09.300
Any chance he did for himself?

48:09.340 --> 48:12.100
Oh, I wouldn't have said so.

48:12.140 --> 48:15.140
She's up on his bedroom wall.
He must have carried a torch.

48:15.180 --> 48:17.780
They were both here last night.
Bruce and Kay.

48:17.820 --> 48:20.220
Bixby took Bruce for 75,000.

48:20.260 --> 48:22.980
75,000? Pounds?

48:23.020 --> 48:24.940
That's nothing to Bruce.

48:24.980 --> 48:28.020
It wasn't about the money.
What was it about?

48:28.060 --> 48:31.500
He just wanted to make Bruce
look small in Kay's eyes.

48:31.540 --> 48:33.860
Bruce got it into his head
to call Bixby a cheat.

48:33.900 --> 48:36.700
There was a row.
Where will I find them?

48:36.740 --> 48:39.140
Across the lake.

48:39.180 --> 48:42.740
There was something Kay said to me
last night.

48:42.780 --> 48:45.140
She'd an idea Bruce had a mistress.

48:45.180 --> 48:47.900
In town. A bus conductress.

48:47.940 --> 48:49.940
Jeannie Hearne?

48:51.860 --> 48:55.300
Bruce is a bully. Always has been.
But a murderer? I can't see it.

49:02.860 --> 49:06.620
Shotgun. Point blank to the face.

49:08.580 --> 49:11.140
Any chance it could have been
self-inflicted?

49:11.180 --> 49:12.860
No. Weapon would suggest not.

49:12.900 --> 49:16.740
Given the injuries, I'll need a set
of latent prints from the house

49:16.780 --> 49:19.540
to confirm it's Bixby.
Check his right-hand pocket.

49:19.580 --> 49:22.860
You'll find a gold gambling chip.
His lucky charm.

49:22.900 --> 49:27.460
Get the lake dragged. 50-yard arc.
See if the gun's in there.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.340
You'll have to come in.

49:29.380 --> 49:32.980
Tomorrow'll do.
Get your head down for a few hours.

49:33.020 --> 49:36.860
You've been up all night.
Oh, I'm fine. I can start now.

49:36.900 --> 49:40.260
I meant... to make a statement.

49:40.300 --> 49:42.660
I found him. He's a...

49:42.700 --> 49:45.140
A friend? You know these people.

49:45.180 --> 49:50.100
You can't be a part of this inquiry.
If you want to make yourself useful,

49:50.140 --> 49:53.700
see if you can't get any further
on the Jeannie Hearne angle.

49:53.740 --> 49:55.620
Step to, then.

49:55.660 --> 49:58.060
I thought...

49:58.100 --> 50:01.340
It doesn't matter how far you run,
or how hard you scrub,

50:01.380 --> 50:04.140
it's there, the stench of it.

50:05.620 --> 50:08.900
Everything we touch.
It gets so you don't notice.

50:08.940 --> 50:10.940
That's what worries me.

51:01.940 --> 51:03.900
Morse?

51:05.380 --> 51:07.180
Good heavens.

51:07.220 --> 51:09.220
Inspector Thursday
said you might be in,

51:09.260 --> 51:11.180
but I didn't think today.

51:11.220 --> 51:13.020
Well, the fair packs up tomorrow,
sir.

51:13.060 --> 51:15.940
Just so.

51:15.980 --> 51:18.220
What happened, I... erm...

51:21.860 --> 51:23.820
I can't change yesterday, but...

51:25.980 --> 51:27.900
..a better tomorrow, yes?

51:29.820 --> 51:31.780
For all of us.
Sir.

51:43.220 --> 51:46.420
I think I met Bixby. Briefly.

51:46.460 --> 51:49.340
Some years ago, in Juan-les-Pins.

51:49.380 --> 51:51.780
And there was never anything
between you?

51:51.820 --> 51:54.180
No. Not on my part.

51:54.220 --> 51:56.060
And there's no reason
you can think of

51:56.100 --> 51:58.940
why he'd have a photograph of you
on his bedroom wall.

52:01.340 --> 52:03.300
None.

52:06.940 --> 52:09.100
You told someone last night
that you believed

52:09.140 --> 52:11.380
your husband was involved
with a bus conductress.

52:11.420 --> 52:14.340
I told Morse that in confidence.
And Detective Constable Morse

52:14.380 --> 52:16.860
repeated it to me in confidence.

52:19.460 --> 52:22.140
Where did you hear it?

52:22.180 --> 52:24.940
A friend. Elva Piper.

52:24.980 --> 52:26.860
Friends like that.

52:26.900 --> 52:29.060
Did Miss Piper give you
the name of this woman?

52:29.100 --> 52:33.100
No. It's just gossip.
I wonder then, Lady Belborough,

52:33.140 --> 52:37.260
if you could account
for your movements Thursday evening.

52:37.300 --> 52:39.620
I was here.

52:39.660 --> 52:41.660
Alone.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.420
We went on a few rides.

52:46.460 --> 52:49.820
Merry-go-round. Dodgems. Magic show.

52:50.860 --> 52:54.300
Jeannie wanted me to go on stage
with her for a trick,

52:54.340 --> 52:57.260
but the magician picked some
other bloke out of the audience.

52:57.300 --> 53:01.700
What did he look like?
Normal working bloke. Thirties.

53:01.740 --> 53:04.540
Specs. Doug, he gave his name as.

53:04.580 --> 53:06.660
You didn't notice him
or anyone else

53:06.700 --> 53:09.020
following you around the fair
afterwards?

53:09.060 --> 53:11.540
No. Nobody.

53:11.580 --> 53:13.500
We were just having fun.

53:13.540 --> 53:17.340
You won her a prize at the shooting
gallery. Is that right? A monkey?

53:17.380 --> 53:20.660
I think the fella
must've felt sorry for me.

53:20.700 --> 53:22.740
Or else he fancied Jeannie.

53:22.780 --> 53:25.100
I couldn't hit a barn door
at ten paces.

53:27.100 --> 53:29.700
Where were you between
four and six o'clock this morning?

53:29.740 --> 53:32.180
Asleep. On the sofa.

53:32.220 --> 53:34.580
Tony Donn and my wife
will confirm that.

53:34.620 --> 53:38.380
What about Thursday?
Play any golf, my Lord?

53:38.420 --> 53:42.420
I'm afraid I side with those
that think it's a good walk spoiled.

53:42.460 --> 53:46.300
And the evening?
I had some drinks in town with Tony.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.500
Why?
There was a woman found dead

53:48.540 --> 53:50.260
Good Friday morning
on the Lake Road

53:50.300 --> 53:52.780
about two miles from here.

53:52.820 --> 53:55.300
Jeannie Hearne. Did you know her?

53:55.340 --> 53:57.780
No. Whatever gave you that idea?

53:57.820 --> 54:00.060
Actually, sir, your wife.

54:00.100 --> 54:03.860
She's of the impression you were
carrying on with a bus conductress.

54:03.900 --> 54:06.220
It happens Miss Hearne
was a clippie.

54:06.260 --> 54:09.420
My wife, Inspector,
is very highly strung.

54:09.460 --> 54:12.460
An hysteric personality.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.740
Often given to flights of fancy.

54:14.780 --> 54:18.020
You'll have no objection if Sergeant
Jakes has a look at your car, then.

54:18.060 --> 54:21.580
I'm afraid my car was stolen
from Oxford station on Wednesday.

54:21.620 --> 54:24.380
You'll find
that I made a full report.

54:24.420 --> 54:26.420
All the good it'll do.

54:33.380 --> 54:36.100
Well, her boyfriend said
you gave her a stuffed toy.

54:36.140 --> 54:38.220
Why was that?
He said he hadn't won anything.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.940
Gotta cast your bread.

54:39.980 --> 54:42.660
Punters see a good-looking girl
walking round with a prize,

54:42.700 --> 54:44.500
might have a go themselves.

54:44.540 --> 54:46.620
Where are they from, the prizes?

54:46.660 --> 54:49.380
I don't know. Far East, maybe.

54:49.420 --> 54:51.940
I'm looking after the pitch
for a pal.

54:51.980 --> 54:54.980
He's laid up. Done his back.

54:55.020 --> 54:56.940
Why, what's your usual line?

54:56.980 --> 54:59.060
Dreamland, Margate.

54:59.100 --> 55:01.340
Penny arcade there. Slots.

55:03.940 --> 55:06.580
Didn't you say
that was Harry Rose's business?

55:06.620 --> 55:09.900
Slots, drugs,
racketeering, you name it.

55:09.940 --> 55:13.380
Harry Rose has been at it since
the Devil was in short trousers.

55:15.380 --> 55:17.700
Right.

55:17.740 --> 55:20.660
Have you seen them?
Cheese and pickle.

55:20.700 --> 55:23.900
The Belboroughs?
All bar the tennis player.

55:23.940 --> 55:25.620
She stayed at the Randolph.

55:25.660 --> 55:29.460
The rest of them haven't had a
decent alibi between them for Bixby.

55:29.500 --> 55:32.420
Though your mate Anthony Donn
says he was with Belborough

55:32.460 --> 55:34.460
the night Jeannie was killed.

55:36.460 --> 55:38.300
You really think
there's a connection

55:38.340 --> 55:42.700
between that bloke at the shooting
gallery and Jeannie Hearne?

55:42.740 --> 55:45.340
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it WAS free advertising,

55:45.380 --> 55:48.980
giving Jeannie that monkey.
I'm just stumbling around, really.

55:49.020 --> 55:51.020
It's what you're good at.

56:01.060 --> 56:03.220
The first week,
I hardly slept at all.

56:05.260 --> 56:07.940
Kept thinking I'd be found
hanging from the bars of the cell

56:07.980 --> 56:09.980
or take a dive from the top walk.

56:12.620 --> 56:15.820
I kept expecting to hear
boots on the landing,

56:15.860 --> 56:19.740
a key in the door,
but nobody came.

56:19.780 --> 56:23.100
A month.

56:23.140 --> 56:25.540
I didn't know
if you were alive or dead.

56:25.580 --> 56:27.820
That was the worst of it.

56:27.860 --> 56:29.700
Well, no, not quite.

56:29.740 --> 56:32.420
The worst was knowing
it was my fault.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.780
I was too slow.

56:35.820 --> 56:38.700
My stupidity almost
left Mrs Thursday a widow -

56:38.740 --> 56:43.100
I knew, walking in to Blenheim Vale,
that I might not walk out.

56:43.140 --> 56:46.100
That's the job, I suppose.

56:46.140 --> 56:48.140
Something bad like that.

56:50.140 --> 56:55.860
Sometimes, you've to put all you are
against all they've got.

56:56.940 --> 56:58.660
It was my decision.

56:58.700 --> 57:00.820
I'd do it again
without a second thought.

57:00.860 --> 57:03.780
Don't ever blame yourself.
If I'd been quicker off the mark.

57:03.820 --> 57:06.500
You were there at the end.
Nobody else.

57:06.540 --> 57:09.140
You had the chance to run,
to look to your own neck.

57:09.180 --> 57:12.660
You didn't. You stood.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.500
A pinch like that,

57:14.540 --> 57:18.020
it's not brain that counts,
it's guts.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.700
I won't forget it. Ever.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.660
Oh, for God's sake,
I can't stand this.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.580
I'm getting out of here.
To see her?

57:36.980 --> 57:39.540
Well? Aren't you?

57:39.580 --> 57:41.260
Coward.

57:41.300 --> 57:44.300
Joss Bixby's more of a man dead
than you'll ever be alive.

57:44.340 --> 57:46.020
Bruce!
Stay out of it, Tony.

57:46.060 --> 57:48.420
This is between me and my wife.

57:48.460 --> 57:50.700
I'm going to stay at the club.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.700
Of course you are.

57:54.100 --> 57:58.340
And where do they all come from,
the props and so forth?

57:58.380 --> 58:03.500
Oh... er... Well, some I've had made
and others I got at auction.

58:03.540 --> 58:06.940
What about this?
Oh, that's from a collection.

58:06.980 --> 58:10.380
I bought them from James Green,
a colleague of mine.

58:10.420 --> 58:14.020
The right illusion can keep
a magician in work for years.

58:14.060 --> 58:16.620
I'm quite partial
to the old abracadabra.

58:16.660 --> 58:19.900
I had an uncle used to magic a penny
from behind my ear when I was a boy.

58:19.940 --> 58:21.620
I could never work it out.
Ha.

58:21.660 --> 58:27.500
Years of preparation and rehearsal
come down to a single heartbeat

58:27.540 --> 58:29.860
in which one makes the impossible...

58:30.820 --> 58:33.900
..a reality.

58:33.940 --> 58:35.980
Miss Hearne's boyfriend said
she took part

58:36.020 --> 58:38.460
in some kind of a gun trick here
the night she died.

58:38.500 --> 58:43.220
She had red hair, if that helps.
Didn't notice. Sorry.

58:43.260 --> 58:46.300
The gun trick requires
absolute concentration.

58:46.340 --> 58:49.980
You see, we have here a revolver.

58:51.260 --> 58:53.060
If you care to examine it,

58:53.100 --> 58:56.580
you will see it's perfectly normal
in all regards.

58:56.620 --> 58:59.980
Likewise, two bullets.

59:00.020 --> 59:02.380
If you would be so good.

59:02.420 --> 59:06.100
Your brother-in-law, Mr Swopes,
might he have seen anything?

59:06.140 --> 59:08.020
No. He would have been backstage,

59:08.060 --> 59:10.980
preparing the props
for the next bit of the show.

59:11.020 --> 59:13.860
Anyway, his eyesight is rather poor.

59:16.460 --> 59:19.460
We can agree
that this pistol has worked.

59:19.500 --> 59:22.100
Roselle. Inspector.

59:26.020 --> 59:29.060
You must stay perfectly still.

59:31.580 --> 59:35.300
Behold. I show you a mystery.

59:47.340 --> 59:50.020
So the second bullet was a blank.

59:50.060 --> 59:55.620
A magician must keep his secrets,
Inspector, even unto the grave.

59:55.660 --> 59:58.380
Perhaps Mr Swopes
will be more forthcoming.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.105
Mr Swopes?

01:00:11.465 --> 01:00:13.105
Mr Swopes?

01:00:43.044 --> 01:00:43.145
♪♪

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.306
I can't believe it.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.020
Andrew, murder a woman for drugs?

01:00:50.201 --> 01:00:53.921
He hadn't exactly taken the trouble
to conceal the evidence, Mr Newton.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.920
The soft toy was just lying there
in his caravan.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.280
Of course, he's never been right
after Coventry.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.040
He might've got over Betty.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.480
But his son. Babe in arms.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.120
Terrible thing to lose a son.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.760
Whatever he lost
doesn't excuse murder.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.760
We've put out a general alert.
He won't get far.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.800
Not with a face like that.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:19.640
It just doesn't seem like Mr Swopes.
He was always so kind and...

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.120
I'd get upset sometimes
over my mum and dad

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.200
and he'd do his best to cheer me up.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.400
Even lent me his scrapbooks.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.360
Why? What happened to your parents?
They died.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.640
Two years this June. Car accident.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.640
How I ended up doing this.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.200
Make ends meet.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.040
This will finish Mr Newton. Zambezi.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.000
Well,
I'll need to keep hold of these.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.520
I'll let you have them back
when I'm done with them.

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.840
We've had it tested.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.440
What our little friend
had stuffed in his belly.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.720
It's confirmed.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.640
Chinese heroin.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.000
Jeannie Hearne was the go-between.
Right?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.840
That's why you gave her the prize.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:05.400
It was nothing to do with
'casting your bread'.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.320
Drug run, was it?

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.040
Fair's in town every bank holiday.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.120
You pass a new shipment
on to Jeannie Hearne.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.120
Then who's it meant for?

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.120
Harry Rose? Bixby?

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.880
And where does Swopes fit in?

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.520
Or was he just helping himself?

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.400
Look, you're just a small cog
in a big machine,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.280
but we've got a kid dead
of the stuff.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.480
An Oxford Student. Gerald Ashbourne.
Killed by your heroin.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.520
It's a long stretch, Clem.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.840
You scratch our back...

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.200
I'm saying nothing
till I've seen my brief.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.160
So save your breath.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.480
Thought you'd turned in
your tin star.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.520
I thought there was a choice.
Seems we were both wrong.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.040
I went by Bixby's.
Ah.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.560
Seems very forlorn.
Lights out, staff gone.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.840
Look...

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.000
If things go bad...

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.800
can you keep me out of it?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.480
For old times?

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.960
Bruce said he was with you
the night Jeannie Hearne was killed.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I was with him
the early part of the evening,

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.640
but about nine,
I lent him the keys to my car

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.880
and he went out.
Where? To meet Jeannie Hearne?

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.840
It's really not me
you should be asking.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.360
Six months ago, you introduced
Jeannie Hearne to Bruce Belborough,

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.720
the Chairman of the East Indies
Shipping Company.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.840
A useful connection, if you're
looking to import Chinese heroin.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.000
Maybe your pal Bixby was in on it.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.760
Are you sure
you won't try the moules?

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.920
No-one does them quite like Pedro.
It was the same variety of heroin

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:45.120
that did for Gerald Ashbourne,
a student at Carlisle College.

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.600
We think Jeannie Hearne
was skimming off your heroin

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.760
and making up the shortfall
with milk powder,

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.480
knocking out the difference
to students for a bit of bunce.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.040
Maybe you took exception to that.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.400
Saturday night,
I saw Bixby at the fairground.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.920
What was he doing?
Looking for your heroin?

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.680
You're wrong.
You couldn't have seen him.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.360
No? Why not?
Cos I was with him at his place

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.720
till... well...
well after the fair closed down.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.080
Maybe Bixby did a deal
with Jeannie and Swopes.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.560
Then they double crossed you.
Now two of them are dead

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.520
and the third's gone AWOL.
But I loved Bix like my own son.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.440
A son...
Do you think I could harm a hair...?

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:29.600
Your theory is this Clem character
brings the heroin to Oxford

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.360
and passes it to Jeannie Hearne

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.920
who was acting as
some sort of go-between for Rose.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.840
That's about the size of it, sir.

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.800
Either Swopes was in on it
from the start

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.560
or, most likely,
he got wise to their racket

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.720
and decided to help himself.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.640
Did Swopes kill Jeannie Hearne
for the heroin?

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:49.440
She had something under her nails,
didn't she?

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.640
Drug related?
To soon to say, sir.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.800
Dr DeBryn has sent it for analysis.
Then where does Bixby fit in?

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.720
He doesn't. Beyond the fact
that he knew Harry Rose.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.920
And the gold chip from the Belvedere
in Jeannie Hearne's handbag.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.000
I don't think we can take that as
proof he had anything to do with it.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.520
Well, it could of been given to her,
by Harry Rose.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.680
Who was he, Bixby?
Dr DeBryn has not been able

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.400
to locate any medical records
for him.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:14.680
No records of any sort.
Until he materialised four years ago

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:17.320
to open this gambling club
in Berkley Square.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.240
Man of mystery.
Just so, sir.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.120
Well, somebody killed him. Perhaps
there's evidence at the house.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.240
I'll take a look...
unless there's any objection.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.600
All right, Morse,
don't let us keep you.

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.360
It's good to have him
back around the place.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.920
Both of you, of course.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.720
But is he up to it?
If Bixby was his friend...

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.760
Morse knows his duty, sir.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.040
Kay.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.800
Kay?

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.760
Kay? Kay, can you hear me?

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.800
Kay?

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.040
Come on.
The doctor will be here soon.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080
Kay?

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.800
Can you hear me?
Come on, stay awake.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.840
That's it.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.520
A policeman.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.720
Yes.
You took us in.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:47.160
That was never my intent.
What was?

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.080
He was in love with you.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.160
I can't help that.
You knew him.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.880
No. Yes.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.960
Before, I found a letter.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.080
Don't. Please.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.960
"By the time you read this,
I'll be gone.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.520
Don't come after me.
You're my heart, Charlie Greel,

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.920
but every time I look at you,

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.040
I've got to put it behind me
and start again.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.040
We let the stars go. Kathy."

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.960
You're Kathy

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
and Bixby was Charlie.

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:27.720
"Every time I look at you."

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.000
What?

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.040
What is it you had to put
behind you?

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:36.520
Don't you want to know
what killed him?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.439
Will that bring him back?

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.200
Well, if you... If you loved him -
Love?

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.359
We were kids.
You wouldn't understand.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.359
No. I don't.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:58.000
You see? How soon it turns.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.080
Us in the car.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.080
That night under the trees.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.160
If Tony hadn't found us
when he did...

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.640
You can still help me.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.440
Kay.
Bruce is in town.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.480
The staff are gone.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.320
Make me feel something.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.360
Anything.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:28.840
Oh, God.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:39.440
It was your car I saw.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.640
You came back.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.720
To tell him to forget about me.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.040
He said...

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.080
He said he couldn't.

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.560
Did you see anyone else
hanging around the grounds?

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.400
I came back when I heard the shot.

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.240
There was no sign of him.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.280
Only you.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.000
Morse?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.640
What the hell's going on?

01:11:55.793 --> 01:11:55.901
♪♪

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.240
There was a call. Very late.
A business emergency.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.000
I had to leave at once for London.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.280
We all thought it was you.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.360
Oh, one evening suit looks
very much like another, I suppose.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
It must have been Roddy.
Farthingale.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.960
You saw him before, I think.
That night we met.

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.520
What happened?
When I got back to the house,

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.040
Roddy was still there,
looking rather the worse.

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.880
He'd gambled away his family fortune
at the table.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.760
And more.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.200
I told him to go abroad,
get out of the country.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.000
He must not have been able
to face it,

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.800
took his own life, poor chap.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.000
But we found your gold poker chip
in his pocket.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.960
Oh, he was such a state,
I gave it to him for luck.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.560
If I hadn't been called away...
Well, you ought to let Kay know

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.120
you're all right.
She's in a pretty bad way.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:44.960
This is yours.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.680
I've read it, I'm afraid.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.720
Charlie Greel.

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.720
Is dead and gone.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.560
If East End barrow boys
can become world-famous snappers...

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.520
The world has changed.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.520
You can be anything you want.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.560
I chose to be Joss Bixby.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.920
The Porter hasn't seen
Ronnie Farthingale since Friday.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.000
Not that one would expect to
over Easter, necessarily.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.200
We thought he must have gone back
to his estate.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.760
I'll need his next of kin.

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:30.640
There's a great aunt, I believe,
but his parents are deceased.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.680
What about friends?

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.760
Someone who might shed some light
on his state of mind?

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.800
Did Roddy Farthingale
know Gerald Ashbourne?

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.080
Gerald Ashborne. The overdose.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.400
They were inseparable,
according to the bursar.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.960
I found these
in Roddy Farthingale's bureau.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.320
Presumably, Roddy found Gerald dead
and tidied up.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.200
Spare his parents' feelings.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.760
Unless they were both addicts.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.840
This is the body of Roddy
Farthingale, then, not Joss Bixby.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.080
The coroner does tend to get picky
about that sort of thing.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.080
Ah, and the last word
on Jeannie Hearne.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:14.560
It's polyurethane under her nails.
Results came in this morning.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:20.160
Also traces of rosin, copal,
isopropyl alcohol, and silica.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.240
They said you were dead.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.400
North Oxford Golf Club's
finally got their finger out.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.320
About that score card you found.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.520
There's two members played that day
with a seven handicap.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.320
One of 'em was Bruce Belborough.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.800
Only the game was booked
in the name of his oppo,

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.520
a Mr Outis.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.680
We're bringing him in now.
Wanna come?

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.920
It was your lead.
He was a friend once.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.960
Sort of.
Bad luck.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.320
Elva, call my solicitor.
Oh, god.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.880
Search the grounds, Jim.

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.320
12 bore. 36-inch barrel.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.320
Spot the deliberate mistake.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.680
Or rather, I suspect,
non-deliberate.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.640
The barrel's too long for
his fingers to reach the trigger.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.520
This wasn't suicide. It was murder.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.520
What are we doing here,
Charlie, of all places?

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.520
The last night of the pitch always
belongs to the show folk, Kathy.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.000
You know that.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.720
Do you remember we always used
to go round the attractions

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.560
when the fair had closed
and all the punters had gone home?

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.960
It was just you and me
in the whole world.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.960
It was never just you and me,
though, was it?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.800
No...

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840
No, but it is now.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.680
Sir.
I've just come from Dr DeBryn.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.480
Roddy Farthingale wasn't suicide.
There's more.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.680
Roddy always wore
a diamond-point bow tie,

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.760
but the body I dragged from the lake
was wearing a club-round.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:35.600
There's a reason magicians use doves
and white rabbits in their act.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.360
Charlie?
Long time.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.760
I brought an old friend to see you.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.040
We found your car.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:10.760
I know things didn't end so good,

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.640
but I've done all right.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:15.320
Made something of myself.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.080
When I saw you were in town,

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.040
it was just too good a chance
to miss.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.840
That's why I'm here.
I want to make it up to you.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.880
Just like old times.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.280
Morse, Inspector.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.320
Everything all right?

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.920
Lady Belborough's husband
has been arrested

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.360
for the murder of Jeannie Hearne.
What?

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.720
Bruce, are you sure?
Thursday afternoon,

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:43.120
he played nine holes at North Oxford
Golf Club with a Mr Outis.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.240
Morse turned up their scorecard
not far from Jeannie Hearne's body.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.760
And he's confirmed this, has he,
this Outis?

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.120
Well, we haven't been able
to find him yet,

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:54.120
but we found Bruce's car
on the estate earlier this evening.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.280
There's no doubt it was the vehicle
used to run down Jeannie Hearne.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.000
Oh, my God.
Darling, it's all right.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.960
You're with me now.
Oh, Bix.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.640
I went through Roddy's effects.

01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.680
Thought you might want this.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:11.360
Though, of course, it wasn't Roddy
Farthingale's pocket we found it in

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.120
any more than it was Roddy
I dragged out of the lake.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.960
Not Roddy?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.040
Then who was it?
I'm sorry, Kay.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.120
It was Joss Bixby. The real Bixby.

01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.160
What's going on?
James Green and Co.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.960
Isn't that where you picked up
some of your props, Mr Newton?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.040
What of it?
It's a rather a lacklustre name

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:36.920
for a magician, don't you think? Not
a patch on Janus Greel and Conrad,

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.200
the original name of your act.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.960
It could just as easily have been
Janus Greel and Sons.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.240
Charlie and Conrad Greel.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.000
Two boys.
Born within an hour of each other.

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.400
Identical in every way,
except for one.

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.560
But as soon as Conrad
removed his spectacles,

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.600
no-one could tell them apart.
Certainly not the audience.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.800
The illusion depended on everyone
believing there was only one boy.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.480
An illusion you maintained
amongst the other show folk.

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.720
A magician keeps
his secrets, even unto the grave.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.560
Isn't that what you told us?
So?

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.960
So one boy had to be kept hidden
from the world.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.440
He existed only
for those few moments on stage.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.800
The rest of the time,
he lived in shadow.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:23.320
What that might do a young soul,
I don't like to think.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.640
Then Kay, or Kathy, joined the act.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.080
You fell for Charlie
and Charlie fell for you, too.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.120
But Conrad wanted you also.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:42.120
"You're my heart, Charlie Greel,

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.240
but every time I look at you..."

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.080
What?

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.240
I saw Conrad.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.800
And that was too much to bear.
He took advantage of you?

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.840
I thought he was Charlie.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.160
We ran away that night.

01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.560
I tried. I really tried,
but in the end...

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.200
You couldn't forget
what his brother had done.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.640
We lost one another.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.520
But Charlie never forgot you.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:23.120
One fine morning,
somehow, somewhere,

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:26.280
he discovered that you were
to marry Bruce Belborough.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.920
Bruce was rich, titled, successful.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.040
If that's what it took to win you,

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.520
then that's what Charlie
would become.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.880
All he needed was a patron,

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.480
so Bixby was born.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.120
A man with no past - the perfect,
legitimate front for Harry Rose.

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.000
Really, Kathy,
that's not what happened.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:49.800
You still insist you're Charlie.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:52.280
Of course he is!

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.680
It's Charlie.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.960
It's you. You... You tell them.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.520
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Newton.
I know you want to believe it.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:01.240
You think I don't know my own son?

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.120
I think
after Charlie and Kay ran away,

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.960
you pulled off
one final disappearing act.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.640
To maintain the secrecy
of the original act,

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.760
Janus Greel became the Great Zambezi
and Conrad became Swopes

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.000
and every other audience plant
that the act could ever need.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.520
Now, what am I? Some sort of man
of a thousand faces?

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.880
You were here
when Jeannie Hearne got on the stage

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.920
and you were there at the wheel
of Bruce's car when Jeannie came to,

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:28.760
afraid and wondering how the hell
she got there from the ghost train.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:38.080
Polyurethane was found
under Jeannie Hearne's fingernails,

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.520
part of your disguise
she'd scratched from your face

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.240
while she fought for her life.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.320
You knew the scorecard
would lead us to Lord Belborough,

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.840
that we'd find out
about his affair with Jeannie Hearne

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.800
and that it was his car
used to kill her.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.200
Help!

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:55.560
Having framed Bruce,

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.160
the only thing that stood in your
way was Joss Bixby.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:04.560
While Bixby drew breath,
you would be forever Swopes

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.000
so you decided to take back
the life you'd always been denied.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.480
A man who wasn't there
slew a man who didn't exist

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.520
and became someone.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.920
Swopes takes the powder.
You take Bixby's place.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:27.880
You get the money,
the girl, the whole shebang.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.280
It's a hell of a trick.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:34.120
An impossible murder.
No victim, no killer.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.040
It's the perfect crime.

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.240
Not quite. "Mr Outis"?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.960
If you're going to choose an alias,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.680
don't pick the same pseudonym
Odysseus used to fight Polyphemus.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.840
Not in a town
filled with classicists.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:55.160
You killed Charlie.
It was the only way.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.160
I just wanted you both to look at me
the way you looked at him.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.560
We could have lived
the rest of our lives together

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.200
and you'd never have known.
It would have been a lie.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:05.800
And you and Bruce is what?

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.280
At least with me,
you would've been loved.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.480
We were meant to be together, Kathy.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.520
I love you.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:25.680
What put you onto
it? Something he said?

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.440
Actually, sir,
it was something he didn't say.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.160
Bixby affected the habit
of calling everyone 'old man, '

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.880
but when I saw him again
at the house,

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.480
he didn't say it. Not once.
And Roddy Farthingale?

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.200
I think Conrad intended
just to take his brother's place,

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.920
to bury him somewhere on the estate

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.640
and none of us would be
any the wiser.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.080
Only Morse arrived
before Conrad had the chance

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.120
to drag Charlie out of the water.

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.160
Someone else had to die.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.120
If Conrad was Bixby, another body
had to be recovered from the lake.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.520
There you go.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:00.400
Why Conrad's name if it was Charlie
who performed the tricks?

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.440
It looked better on the playbill.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.840
I tried it both ways.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.920
'Janus Greel and Conrad'
brought more people to the tent.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:16.600
It had... class.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.760
How could you do it? Your own son?

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.680
All art...

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.160
demands sacrifice.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.960
But how do you decide?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.360
How does a father choose
which son gets a life

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:35.360
and which is condemned to darkness?

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.360
Just like that.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.800
Morris! Bring the car around.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.640
So you're leaving.
Safari. Kenya.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.280
Guy Mortmain has a place out there.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.360
Bruce thought a change of scene
might be good for me.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.880
Bixby's funeral -
you can just walk away?

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.160
He wasn't the only one who changed.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.760
Bixby didn't belong
in their world any more than I do...

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.125
Did.

01:27:15.175 --> 01:27:18.135
I wanted to tell him that
the last night I saw him.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.200
That he was better than that.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.040
Nobody gets to choose.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.400
The further a man runs away
from his nature,

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.560
the sooner it'll find him out.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.560
So what does that make me?

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.160
A good detective.

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.520
And a poor policeman.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.560
That too.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.040
If only I'd have told him.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.440
Wouldn't have made
the blindest bit of difference.

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.120
He was set on the girl,
his memory of her at least.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.920
Zambezi was right.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.120
There's no real magic in this world.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.960
Only love.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.720
The rest is just smoke and mirrors.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.440
Back to work, then.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.760
Back to work.

01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:28.132
