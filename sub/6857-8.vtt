00:16.600 --> 00:18.700
<i>Victory on Geonosis!</i>

00:18.900 --> 00:20.350
<i>After a massive assault,</i>

00:20.351 --> 00:23.500
<i>the Republic has finally
recaptured the Separatist planet</i>

00:23.501 --> 00:26.900
<i>and shut down its droid factories of doom.</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:32.150
<i>An investigation by Luminara Unduli led to
the discovery of Queen Karina the Great,</i>

00:32.151 --> 00:36.200
<i>whose hive-mind could reanimate
dead Geonosian soldiers.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:38.600
<i>During the destruction of the Queen's temple,</i>

00:38.601 --> 00:41.900
<i>the Jedi apprehended her advisor
Poggle the Lesser,</i>

00:41.901 --> 00:46.100
<i>and now prepare to deliver the villain
to Coruscant for trial...</i>

00:54.800 --> 00:56.700
I'm afraid we have a complication.

00:56.750 --> 00:57.950
Don't we always?

00:57.951 --> 01:01.200
I've just received a distress signal
from our forces on Dantooine.

01:01.450 --> 01:05.000
Master Windu's defenses held,
but at a great cost to his men.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.400
They need medical supplies immediately.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.800
We can obtain these supplies at
the medical station near Ord Cestus.

01:10.801 --> 01:15.500
We're delivering Poggle to Coruscant,
and Cestus is not exactly on the way.

01:15.501 --> 01:18.500
The Republic must begin
debriefing Poggle right away

01:18.501 --> 01:20.800
if we're to get useful intelligence from him.

01:20.801 --> 01:25.300
Master, I suggest we let our padawans
handle the supply mission.

01:25.301 --> 01:27.200
Whatever needs to be done, Master.

01:27.201 --> 01:28.500
I'm happy to help.

01:28.501 --> 01:29.600
As am I.

01:29.601 --> 01:30.800
Very well.

01:30.801 --> 01:32.200
Take a medical frigate.

01:32.201 --> 01:34.100
And after we've delivered Poggle to Coruscant,

01:34.101 --> 01:36.600
we'll rendezvous with you
for the voyage to Dantooine.

02:09.550 --> 02:10.750
Sorry, boys.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.900
Hope I didn't interrupt any pleasant dreams.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.500
Got another mission, sir?

02:15.550 --> 02:17.050
You bet.

02:17.051 --> 02:20.200
We're making a medical 
supply run to Ord Cestus.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.250
Ugh.

02:21.251 --> 02:24.600
Thought we were bred for battle,
not running errands.

02:24.650 --> 02:25.600
Hey.

02:25.601 --> 02:28.500
We were bred to follow orders, Pulsar.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.700
You got a problem with that?

02:30.701 --> 02:31.700
No, sir.

02:31.701 --> 02:32.701
No problem.

02:32.702 --> 02:34.550
That's what I thought.

02:34.551 --> 02:35.951
Now move.

02:40.800 --> 02:41.850
Scythe.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.800
Come on. Up, brother.
Up and at 'em.

02:53.600 --> 02:54.900
Hey, Scythe.

02:54.901 --> 02:57.300
Welcome back to the land of the living.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.150
Thank you, sir.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.900
We are ready to make our jump, Master Fisto.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.700
Good. I look forward to your arrival.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.100
What? What is it?

03:56.900 --> 03:58.500
It's too quiet.

03:58.501 --> 04:01.700
It's a big change from
all the fighting the last few days.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.600
You should enjoy this peace while it lasts.

04:04.601 --> 04:05.850
I can't.

04:05.851 --> 04:07.100
Let's go eat.

05:01.800 --> 05:07.700
I was just thinking about what you said earlier
about enjoying the peace while it lasts.

05:07.750 --> 05:11.200
As a Jedi, I'm not sure 
I know how to do that.

05:11.201 --> 05:15.000
Master Windu has said we are
keepers of the peace, not warriors.

05:15.100 --> 05:19.300
However, once the war is over,
it will be our job to maintain the peace.

05:19.350 --> 05:24.350
Yes, but will we do so as
keepers of the peace or warriors?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.150
And what's the difference?

05:27.200 --> 05:29.400
I don't have all the answers, Ahsoka.

05:29.401 --> 05:31.100
Like you, I'm a learner.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.050
What does your Master tell you?

05:33.051 --> 05:34.200
Anakin?

05:34.201 --> 05:41.200
Oh, um, you might find some of his
thoughts on the future, uh, a bit radical.

05:41.201 --> 05:43.000
Really? Why?

05:43.001 --> 05:46.700
Let's just say my Master will
always do what needs to be done.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.900
I'm not even sure
how peacetime will agree with him.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.300
Just come up to check on us, Scythe?

05:59.100 --> 06:02.700
Well, we are on course,
and all systems are green.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
What the-- ?

06:08.650 --> 06:11.000
We have control of the bridge.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.650
Evening, Ox, Edge.

06:16.651 --> 06:17.950
Would you like to join us?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.350
Is something wrong, troopers?

06:29.750 --> 06:31.550
Troopers, stand down!

06:43.450 --> 06:44.450
What are you doing?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.950
Two clones just attacked us.

06:45.951 --> 06:47.500
What is going on?

06:47.550 --> 06:49.900
Trap, do you know what
happened to those troopers?

06:49.950 --> 06:52.750
Couldn't tell you, Commander.
I'm just as confused as--

06:52.751 --> 06:54.400
You're in charge of those men.

06:54.401 --> 06:55.850
Did you order them to kill us?

06:55.950 --> 06:58.100
No, sir. I did not.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.500
What's happening?

06:59.501 --> 07:01.050
Why would they do this?

07:01.200 --> 07:03.250
We don't know. We heard shots.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.050
Why should we believe you?

07:05.350 --> 07:07.750
Look, no guns.

07:15.350 --> 07:17.650
These men wouldn't just 
attack us without reason.

07:17.850 --> 07:22.450
My Master had a clone betray them once,
a traitor who was paid off by Ventress.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.050
It can't be that simple.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.850
At least, it didn't feel like that.

07:26.950 --> 07:28.150
Excuse me, sir.

07:28.151 --> 07:30.650
We should make sure that
we're still in control of the bridge.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.450
Bridge, this is Barriss. Respond.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.750
We need to get up there.

07:34.751 --> 07:36.600
We need to find out what's going on.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.850
But these two will be 
coming around any minute.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.150
Havoc can watch them
until we check on the bridge.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.550
Okay, let's go.

07:54.350 --> 07:56.950
The cargo ship failed to 
check in on schedule.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.950
I attempted to contact them.

07:58.951 --> 08:00.500
There is no reply.

08:00.501 --> 08:01.750
I don't like it.

08:01.751 --> 08:02.850
Something's up.

08:02.900 --> 08:07.050
It is certainly most unlike
either padawan to lose contact.

08:07.150 --> 08:08.250
They're in trouble.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.900
Anakin, have faith in your padawan.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.350
She would have checked in.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.850
Like you always do?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.050
Good point.

08:15.051 --> 08:17.850
Sometimes I don't think you realize
how alike you two have become.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.950
We need to continue our 
interrogation of Poggle.

08:21.951 --> 08:23.450
Yes, agreed.

08:23.451 --> 08:25.850
He's being most uncooperative.

08:29.950 --> 08:32.450
Keep your ears open in case Ahsoka calls.

08:32.451 --> 08:33.350
Got it.

08:42.450 --> 08:46.050
Engage the autopilot and
put up the security shields.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.250
Someone doesn't want us going up there.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.850
I'll attempt to override the controls.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.250
He's infected!

09:06.350 --> 09:07.750
Get this thing off me!

09:13.200 --> 09:15.550
Ugh, what is that?

09:15.600 --> 09:17.850
Looks like some type of parasite.

09:17.851 --> 09:20.050
It must be controlling their actions.

09:20.150 --> 09:21.650
Mind control.

09:22.150 --> 09:23.850
Well, that explains a lot.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.650
Trap was my friend.

09:25.651 --> 09:27.350
He would never have tried to kill us.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.150
How did these things get
on board in the first place?

09:31.150 --> 09:34.150
They must have infected the clones
while they were on Geonosis.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.050
We'll have to quarantine the ship.

09:36.051 --> 09:39.650
We should also contact Master Fisto
and let him know about the situation.

09:40.050 --> 09:40.950
Let's go.

09:45.550 --> 09:49.150
- That sound, it's...
- Geonosian.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.150
We have to help him.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.550
It's too late.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.350
Barriss, let's go for the vent.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.950
I'll go to the reactor room
and disable the thrusters.

11:00.951 --> 11:04.150
You head for the aft comm-center
and send a warning to Master Fisto.

11:04.151 --> 11:06.750
We have to stop the ship from
reaching the medical station.

11:10.950 --> 11:12.350
I don't know, Barriss.

11:12.351 --> 11:14.250
I think we should stay together.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.450
As do I.

11:15.451 --> 11:18.100
Unfortunately, that's not
a luxury we have right now.

11:18.150 --> 11:20.250
One of us must succeed, Ahsoka.

11:20.350 --> 11:22.950
If you need to, you'll do what must be done.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.250
I know it.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.150
Yes, of course.

11:26.151 --> 11:27.650
Then I'll see you soon.

11:34.850 --> 11:38.850
As long as these things are on board,
we dare not dock with the medical station.

11:38.851 --> 11:40.850
You must bring the ship in.

11:40.851 --> 11:43.950
The only way we can stop these parasites
is to analyze them.

11:43.951 --> 11:46.750
You don't understand
how terrible these things are.

11:46.751 --> 11:48.050
What if they get loose?

11:48.051 --> 11:50.151
We will take precautions.

11:50.350 --> 11:53.650
I have a bad feeling about this, 
Master Fisto,

11:54.200 --> 11:56.400
but I will follow your instructions.

12:16.800 --> 12:22.600
If there's one thing we clones know,
it's how to stop a Jedi.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.750
No!

12:34.150 --> 12:35.550
Almost got it.

12:36.150 --> 12:39.150
Cargo ship TB-73, this is clone Captain Rex.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.450
Please respond.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.450
Rex, this is Ahsoka.

12:42.650 --> 12:45.050
Boy, am I glad to hear your voice.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.450
Likewise, sir.

12:46.550 --> 12:48.850
I've got someone here
who wants to speak with you.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.600
Ahsoka, what's going on?

12:50.601 --> 12:51.600
Are you okay?

12:51.601 --> 12:54.500
Well, not exactly.

13:05.050 --> 13:07.100
Make sure you have a wrist com. Keep it on.

13:07.101 --> 13:08.650
I'm going to interrogate Poggle.

13:08.651 --> 13:10.150
He might have some answers.

13:10.151 --> 13:12.250
Find Barriss and wait for my signal.

13:16.650 --> 13:17.950
Barriss, you're back.

13:17.951 --> 13:19.051
Were you successful?

13:24.150 --> 13:26.250
Barriss, what's wrong?

13:27.950 --> 13:29.250
Barriss, no!

13:33.650 --> 13:35.050
I'm your friend!

13:35.150 --> 13:38.100
Barriss, snap out of it!

13:45.950 --> 13:48.350
Barriss! It's not you!

13:48.550 --> 13:50.250
It's the creatures.

13:50.251 --> 13:51.251
Fight them!

14:08.350 --> 14:09.850
Leave us.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.650
You will answer my questions.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.850
Your feeble Jedi mind tricks
do not work on Geonosians.

14:20.851 --> 14:23.000
The other Jedi already learned this.

14:25.850 --> 14:27.250
Mind tricks?

14:31.850 --> 14:34.350
I don't need mind tricks to get you to talk.

14:36.450 --> 14:39.050
I will never talk, Jedi.

14:39.350 --> 14:41.950
We'll see about that, Poggle.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.200
I made contact with Ahsoka.

15:24.201 --> 15:25.450
What's their status?

15:25.451 --> 15:27.800
Geonosian parasites have infected her crew.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.450
How did they get on board her ship?

15:29.451 --> 15:33.250
Poggle said the parasites must have need a
new host after we raided the Queen's temple.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.150
You interrogated Poggle?

15:35.350 --> 15:36.700
I did.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.150
There wasn't time to get the rest of you.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.550
How did you get him to talk?

15:41.750 --> 15:45.150
Look, all that matters is that
he told me how to stop the worms.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.850
This is Ahsoka. Come in.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.750
Ahsoka, listen to me.

15:55.751 --> 15:58.251
The worms are affected by the cold.

15:58.350 --> 15:59.650
Cold?

15:59.651 --> 16:01.150
That's how we stop them?

16:01.200 --> 16:02.900
Rupture the coolant system.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.050
Did you hear me?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.200
Rupture the coolant system.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.151
The coolant system. Got it.

16:56.150 --> 16:57.400
That's Ahsoka's ship.

16:57.401 --> 16:59.200
It just came out of hyperspace.

16:59.201 --> 17:01.150
Send out the tugs to help guide them in.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.050
Warn all medical hazard crew

17:08.050 --> 17:12.150
that I don't want anyone boarding that ship
until the parasites are contained.

17:12.151 --> 17:15.450
Sound all the alarms and
prepare the subzero conduits.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.349
Engage tractor beam.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.250
There you are.

17:40.251 --> 17:42.300
You can't hide from me.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.450
The bridge, at last.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.900
We're coming in awfully fast.

18:06.901 --> 18:08.100
This is Ahsoka Tano.

18:08.101 --> 18:09.100
Can you hear me?

18:09.101 --> 18:10.450
I'm shutting down the engines.

18:10.451 --> 18:11.550
I'll try to reverse the--

18:17.750 --> 18:19.850
I've having a hard time slowing her down!

18:19.851 --> 18:21.250
There's no one at the controls.

18:21.251 --> 18:22.600
The pilot must be dead.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.000
Sir, she's listing.

18:24.001 --> 18:26.250
The escort ships must maintain control.

18:36.750 --> 18:39.250
Kill me, please.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.250
I can't.

19:06.450 --> 19:08.250
Full power now. Now!

19:15.950 --> 19:17.450
We got her. We got her.

19:17.550 --> 19:19.350
Attach the subzero conduits.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.400
The temperature's below freezing, sir.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.900
Let's board, then, but stay on guard.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.750
They may still be dangerous.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.750
Hello, Master Fisto.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.250
We're ready to pick up the supplies.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.550
We'll take care of that.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.850
You rest now, Ahsoka.

20:02.350 --> 20:04.300
It's all right, Ahsoka. It's okay.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.550
You're safe.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.350
Barriss?

20:08.650 --> 20:12.200
Barriss is fine, thanks to your efforts.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.950
And so are the clones.

20:14.650 --> 20:16.750
What were those things?

20:16.850 --> 20:18.450
I think I can help answer that.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.850
We had the parasite worms analyzed.

20:22.851 --> 20:27.250
They are the same type of creature
you found on Geonosis, Master Skywalker.

20:27.251 --> 20:29.650
We'll have to inform the troops on Geonosis.

20:29.700 --> 20:33.400
This parasite might explain how they
recaptured the planet the first time.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.350
I don't want it happening again.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.150
You have been through 
quite an ordeal, little one.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.450
Master Skywalker, may I have a word?

20:46.850 --> 20:51.850
Master, on the ship, Barriss was gone,

20:51.851 --> 20:55.450
and she wanted me to kill her.

20:55.451 --> 20:56.850
She told me--

20:56.851 --> 20:58.401
But you couldn't do it.

20:58.850 --> 21:01.750
No. No, I couldn't.

21:01.751 --> 21:03.650
But should I have?

21:03.750 --> 21:06.050
I mean, it worked out now,

21:06.051 --> 21:10.350
but if we had failed, if the ship docked
and the worms spread, and...

21:10.550 --> 21:14.850
Ahsoka, it's your duty to
save as many lives as you can.

21:14.950 --> 21:18.250
Barriss knew you could save thousands
if the worms were destroyed,

21:18.251 --> 21:21.350
which she thought meant destroying her too.

21:21.650 --> 21:23.550
But you did the right thing.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.450
You knew the freezing cold 
would kill the worms.

21:27.950 --> 21:32.250
Letting go our attachments is
a difficult struggle for all of us.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.600
You followed your instincts.

21:34.650 --> 21:37.150
I'm sure she would agree that
you made the right choice.
