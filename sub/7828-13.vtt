00:33.213 --> 00:36.914
We now return to
Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

00:37.134 --> 00:39.625
Faster, Knightboat.
Gotta catch those starfish poachers.

00:39.845 --> 00:42.170
Don't have to yell, Michael.
I'm all around you.

00:43.223 --> 00:45.346
Oh, no. They're headed for land.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.646
- We'll never catch them now.
- Incorrect. Look, a canal.

00:52.858 --> 00:56.610
- Go, Knightboat, go.
- Every week, there's a canal.

00:56.236 --> 00:58.312
- Or an inlet.
- Or a fjord.

00:58.530 --> 01:00.819
Quiet! I won't hear another word
against the boat.

01:00.991 --> 01:05.710
- Okay, TV off. It's family time.
- But, Marge...

01:05.287 --> 01:08.870
...Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

01:09.830 --> 01:12.202
Homer, you promised,
one night of family time a week.

01:12.378 --> 01:15.581
Besides, that back-talking boat
sets a bad example.

01:15.798 --> 01:17.780
Says you, woman.

01:17.299 --> 01:19.700
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Mom.

01:19.218 --> 01:21.923
All right, family time begins now.

01:30.938 --> 01:32.480
- Homer.
- It was Bart.

01:32.648 --> 01:34.890
Why don't we all look
at the photo album.

01:35.670 --> 01:37.240
So many memories.

01:37.194 --> 01:40.480
Oh, look, Knightboat.

01:42.658 --> 01:45.445
And here's our TV next to the mirror.

01:45.661 --> 01:47.737
It looks like we have two.

01:49.206 --> 01:50.369
- Two.
- Two.

01:50.541 --> 01:54.159
Yeah, yeah, two.
Let's get to the baby pictures.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.712
- Mom.
- That's exciting.

01:56.922 --> 01:58.915
Oh, please.

02:03.137 --> 02:04.465
Here's Bart sleeping.

02:04.638 --> 02:06.298
Here he is dozing.

02:06.473 --> 02:09.308
Here he is after a visit
from the sandman.

02:09.476 --> 02:11.635
Here's nappy time, Bart.

02:11.812 --> 02:14.730
Here's a cute one.
He's all tuckered out.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.312
Why aren't there any pictures
of Maggie?

02:17.985 --> 02:23.110
Well, I'm glad you asked.
It's actually a very interesting story.

02:24.116 --> 02:27.319
It all began about two years ago,
before Maggie was even born.

02:27.494 --> 02:30.680
Bart, you were Lisa's age.
And, Lisa...

02:30.247 --> 02:33.248
...you were the age Bart was
several years ago.

02:33.459 --> 02:36.329
Get the camera ready,
Bart very sleepy.

02:36.545 --> 02:39.360
Listen carefully, and my words
will shape images...

02:39.214 --> 02:40.922
...as clear as any TV show.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.582
It was a tumultuous time
for our nation.

02:43.761 --> 02:46.927
The clear-beverage craze gave us all
a reason to live.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.849
The information superhighway
showed the average person...

02:50.170 --> 02:52.472
...what some nerd thinks
about Star Trek.

02:52.645 --> 02:57.141
And the domestication of the dog
continued unabated.

02:57.483 --> 02:59.938
I was at my workstation
when suddenly...

03:00.110 --> 03:02.269
Attention, American workers.

03:02.488 --> 03:07.150
Your plant has been taken over by
an all-star team of freelance terrorists.

03:08.369 --> 03:10.990
Not on my shift!

03:19.460 --> 03:21.169
No, you don't.

03:22.910 --> 03:25.257
Simpson, 10, terrorists, 8.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.131
- Homer, tell the story right.
- Okay.

03:35.229 --> 03:36.771
Homer, you should see a doctor.

03:36.939 --> 03:39.809
I don't think a healthy man
can make that kind of smell.

03:39.984 --> 03:41.442
Your paychecks, gentlemen.

03:45.155 --> 03:48.240
This is it.
With a single glorious check...

03:48.409 --> 03:51.694
...I'm finally completely out of debt.

03:57.420 --> 04:01.372
Yes! With my bills paid off,
I can finally quit this lousy job.

04:01.547 --> 04:03.456
But, Homer, how you gonna
make a living?

04:03.674 --> 04:06.758
Don't worry about Homer J.
I've got a plan.

04:06.927 --> 04:11.139
- A plan that'll fix you good.
- Hey, what did we do?

04:11.348 --> 04:14.302
Sorry, that just slipped out.
I'll miss you.

04:14.518 --> 04:17.435
Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty.

04:17.603 --> 04:21.223
And since I quit,
I can do anything I want.

04:21.442 --> 04:22.722
Is that so?

04:23.610 --> 04:26.528
Lovely desk.
It would be too bad if someone...

04:26.697 --> 04:30.529
...oh, I don't know,
didn't use a coaster!

04:33.370 --> 04:35.162
Such a nice, tidy office.

04:35.331 --> 04:38.913
Maybe it's time you started
living like a pig!

04:40.753 --> 04:43.670
Oh, I hope I haven't upset you...

04:43.839 --> 04:45.582
...bongo head!

04:49.261 --> 04:52.630
Oh, I should be resisting this,
but I'm paralyzed with rage...

04:52.806 --> 04:55.594
...and island rhythms.

04:55.768 --> 04:57.926
Go, Homer. Yeah. Yeah.

04:58.103 --> 05:00.475
Way to play the boss's head
like a bongo, Homer.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.391
He's getting a pretty good sound
out of that guy.

05:08.489 --> 05:11.406
That's for employing me
for eight years.

05:16.163 --> 05:18.203
And that is that.

05:18.374 --> 05:22.917
Goodbye, mind-numbing,
backbreaking labor forever.

05:23.128 --> 05:26.332
Hello, dream job in paradise.

05:30.511 --> 05:34.176
And now, the final phase of my plan.

05:38.268 --> 05:40.226
Barney, any chance
you can get me a job?

05:40.396 --> 05:45.354
Hey. Sure, Homer.
I told you, my uncle owns the place.

05:45.567 --> 05:48.901
- Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?
- Sure.

05:51.991 --> 05:53.948
- Barney, you're fired.
- Okay.

05:54.118 --> 05:56.270
Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags.

05:56.203 --> 05:57.946
Oh, and a change of pants.

05:58.163 --> 06:00.121
- Why?
- When it happens, you'll know.

06:02.209 --> 06:03.834
You're a pin monkey?

06:04.878 --> 06:07.500
Finally, I don't have to be ashamed
of my father's job.

06:07.673 --> 06:10.793
It's romantic, throwing off
the shackles of the workaday world...

06:10.968 --> 06:13.174
...and following a dream, of sorts.

06:13.387 --> 06:15.261
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

06:15.431 --> 06:17.257
Can we get by
on a pin monkey's salary?

06:17.433 --> 06:18.808
Don't worry, Marge.

06:18.976 --> 06:21.763
I've come up with
a perfectly balanced budget.

06:21.937 --> 06:26.266
There will be exactly enough money
for you, me, Bart and Lisa...

06:26.442 --> 06:29.630
...if we make a few small sacrifices.

06:32.197 --> 06:34.867
From now on,
we use regular toilet paper...

06:35.340 --> 06:37.655
...not that fancy quilted kind.

06:39.496 --> 06:41.619
And only one of you kids
can go to college.

06:41.832 --> 06:43.326
- Fine.
- Fine.

06:44.877 --> 06:47.831
That night, your mom and I
went out for a romantic evening...

06:48.500 --> 06:49.997
...to celebrate
the start of our new life.

06:50.174 --> 06:52.546
We began with dinner and dancing.

07:03.687 --> 07:07.560
Followed by a stroll on the beach.

07:12.321 --> 07:14.942
- Marge.
- Homer.

07:15.157 --> 07:17.778
I've got sand in my underpants.

07:17.993 --> 07:19.785
Me too. Let's go home.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.551
I love you, Marge.

07:42.726 --> 07:45.300
I love you too, Homie.

07:45.521 --> 07:49.388
Everything in our lives
is finally perfectly balanced.

07:49.566 --> 07:52.852
I hope things stay exactly
like this forever.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.748
Did you have to be so graphic?

08:07.960 --> 08:11.708
It's okay, Marge. They pave the way
for this kind of filth in school.

08:11.922 --> 08:14.810
Dad, were you excited
that Mom was pregnant?

08:14.299 --> 08:16.257
Actually, your mother
hadn't told me yet.

08:16.427 --> 08:19.878
At that time, I had no idea
Maggie even existed.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.675
- Dad!
- Dad!

08:22.850 --> 08:24.427
Hi, Maggie.

08:26.937 --> 08:30.520
So anyhow, back then
there was no way for me to know...

08:30.691 --> 08:32.648
...your mother was pregnant.

08:34.236 --> 08:35.813
Hey.

08:36.572 --> 08:40.356
Marge, you tie up the bathroom
every morning. I've gotta wash my hair.

08:40.576 --> 08:45.617
The next few weeks at my dream job
were like a wonderful waking coma.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.499
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

08:50.669 --> 08:52.329
- Hi, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

08:52.504 --> 08:54.820
Hi.

08:57.134 --> 08:59.376
Bowling-fresh.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.389
Urinal-fresh.

09:17.571 --> 09:22.233
Homer, did you polish your head
in the Shine-O Ball-O?

09:22.409 --> 09:24.817
- No.
- Okay, then.

09:26.789 --> 09:29.493
I slowly learned the intricate mysteries
of the alley...

09:29.667 --> 09:32.703
...like where the pins go
after they're knocked down.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.856
I was in heaven.
If horseracing is the sport of kings...

09:56.260 --> 09:57.770
...then surely, bowling...

09:57.945 --> 10:01.314
...is a very good sport as well.

10:01.532 --> 10:03.655
- Hey, great job, Homer.
- Thanks a lot, Homer.

10:03.826 --> 10:05.534
Hey, you're the best.

10:05.744 --> 10:10.905
I'm gonna make it after all

10:13.460 --> 10:16.165
Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson.
You're pregnant.

10:18.299 --> 10:20.421
Am I to take it that this is...

10:21.218 --> 10:23.900
...an unwanted pregnancy?

10:23.178 --> 10:25.930
Oh, no, no. Not exactly.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.100
It's just that I haven't told Homer yet.
With his new job...

10:29.184 --> 10:31.640
...I don't know how we'll
be able to afford this.

10:31.812 --> 10:36.225
Well, you know, a healthy baby
can bring upwards of $60,000.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.648
- What?!
- Of course, that was just a test.

10:38.819 --> 10:43.280
Had you reacted differently, why,
you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test.

10:45.159 --> 10:48.991
So in a few months, both of you
will have a brand-new brother or sister.

10:49.163 --> 10:51.701
- Been there, done that.
- I hope it's a girl.

10:51.915 --> 10:55.699
You know nothing about genetics, Lis.
It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.

10:55.878 --> 10:59.247
- You're worried about telling Dad.
- Why do you say that?

10:59.423 --> 11:01.961
Well, you've been in my room
for about four hours now.

11:02.134 --> 11:04.174
Hey, I'm just hanging.

11:12.311 --> 11:14.350
- Homie, I...
- Can't talk. Praying.

11:14.521 --> 11:18.733
Dear Lord, the gods have been good
to me, and I am thankful.

11:18.901 --> 11:23.112
For the first time in my life,
everything is absolutely perfect...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.688
...just the way it is.

11:26.784 --> 11:29.357
So here's the deal:
You freeze everything as it is...

11:29.536 --> 11:31.328
...and I won't ask for anything more.

11:31.497 --> 11:35.310
If that is okay,
please give me absolutely no sign.

11:35.209 --> 11:39.954
Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you
this offering of cookies and milk.

11:40.130 --> 11:44.424
If you want me to eat them for you,
give me no sign. Thy will be done.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.971
I've got to tell Homer about this baby
in just the right way...

11:58.148 --> 12:00.220
...and at just the right time.

12:00.192 --> 12:02.517
Until then, please keep this
to yourselves.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.278
If he found out now, it would
probably destroy him, huh?

12:06.490 --> 12:08.680
Oh, yes.

12:08.283 --> 12:09.659
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.

12:09.827 --> 12:12.690
Wait a minute. Wait. I know that look.

12:12.246 --> 12:14.285
Now, promise you won't tell Homer.

12:14.498 --> 12:16.704
Oh, we promise we won't tell...

12:16.875 --> 12:18.749
...Homer.

12:23.132 --> 12:26.200
Hello. Is this A. Aaronson?

12:26.176 --> 12:30.803
It might interest you to know that
Marge Simpson is pregnant again.

12:33.580 --> 12:36.590
Just thought you'd like to know,
Mr. Zowkowski.

12:37.438 --> 12:41.518
There. Aaronson and Zowkowski
are the two biggest gossips in town.

12:41.692 --> 12:43.768
In an hour, everyone will know.

12:45.321 --> 12:50.397
Another perfect day in my perfect life
with my perfect job.

12:50.576 --> 12:53.327
Hey, just heard the news
over the squawk box.

12:53.495 --> 12:56.615
- That's nice work, Homer.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

12:56.790 --> 12:58.913
It is nice work.

12:59.626 --> 13:03.245
Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard
about the little bundle of joy.

13:03.422 --> 13:06.873
- Congratulations, sir.
- It's true, the bundle is little...

13:07.510 --> 13:10.510
...but I'm not in it for the money.

13:11.388 --> 13:14.555
Hey, Homer,
way to get Marge pregnant.

13:15.684 --> 13:18.389
This is getting very abstract,
but thank you...

13:18.562 --> 13:21.349
...I do enjoy working
at the bowling alley.

13:22.232 --> 13:26.147
Surprise! Baby shower.

13:26.362 --> 13:29.446
Baby shower?
You know I haven't told Homer yet.

13:29.615 --> 13:31.239
And he'll be home any minute.

13:31.408 --> 13:32.867
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

13:37.915 --> 13:40.157
Man, it's windy as hell out there.

13:40.376 --> 13:44.243
Hey, wait a minute.
What are all these presents?

13:44.463 --> 13:45.838
It looks like you're...

13:46.600 --> 13:48.877
...showering Marge with gifts.

13:49.677 --> 13:54.890
With little, tiny baby-sized gifts.

13:54.765 --> 13:58.510
Well, I'll be in the tub.

13:58.686 --> 14:01.603
By the way, congratulations
on your new job, Homer.

14:01.814 --> 14:04.898
New job? Marge is pregnant?!

14:05.670 --> 14:08.234
No!

14:11.907 --> 14:14.825
Dad, you really threw a tantrum
like a little sissy girl?

14:14.994 --> 14:16.322
Oh, just that one time.

14:16.495 --> 14:18.784
Actually, when I was
about to have Bart...

14:18.997 --> 14:20.990
You're pregnant?!

14:24.795 --> 14:27.840
And then when I told him
about Lisa...

14:27.297 --> 14:28.756
You're pregnant again?!

14:33.220 --> 14:34.501
Who wouldn't be upset?

14:34.680 --> 14:37.681
That new baby in your mother's womb
was a ticking time bomb...

14:37.850 --> 14:41.160
...threatening to blow this family
eight ways from Sunday.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.636
- Where are you going?
- You can't expect a person...

14:43.814 --> 14:45.474
...to sit for 30 minutes straight.

14:45.649 --> 14:48.105
I'm gonna get a snack and maybe
go to the bathroom.

14:48.277 --> 14:52.321
I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think
about products I might like to purchase.

14:56.618 --> 14:58.326
I don't have that.

15:01.832 --> 15:03.291
You're pregnant.

15:03.500 --> 15:07.664
We're gonna have to have a baby.
All our financial plans are ruined.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.165
We're doomed. Doomed, I tells you!

15:14.530 --> 15:16.460
- Bart, let your father tell the story.
- Yeah.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.350
- Okay, but I know funny.
- Anyhoo...

15:20.601 --> 15:21.929
We're doomed!

15:22.102 --> 15:24.950
- Homer, you had a head.
- Check.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.596
And your bottom was a little bigger.

15:27.691 --> 15:29.814
You've worked hard
at the bowling alley.

15:29.985 --> 15:32.820
- Why don't you ask for a raise.
- Yeah, a raise.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.568
I've never been good enough
at any job to deserve one.

15:35.741 --> 15:38.493
But I'm damn good at this one.
That's it.

15:38.661 --> 15:40.986
I'm gonna march
right up to Al and say:

15:41.205 --> 15:44.656
Steve. I mean, Al,
I think I deserve a raise.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.366
You're a hard worker.
I'd like to give you a raise.

15:47.544 --> 15:51.163
But the alley just ain't doing enough
business to pay that kind of money.

15:51.382 --> 15:55.629
How about if I triple the business?
Then could I get a raise?

15:55.844 --> 15:57.636
Well, yeah, but...

16:22.454 --> 16:24.790
Of course.

16:26.250 --> 16:27.744
Bowling. Bowling here.

16:27.918 --> 16:30.374
Come bowl now. Get your bowling.

16:30.546 --> 16:32.455
Who's ready? Bowling.

16:32.673 --> 16:35.450
Mom, make Dad tell the story right.

16:35.259 --> 16:37.335
That's what really happened.

16:38.178 --> 16:41.761
My marketing plan attracted a record
number of police and fire officials...

16:41.932 --> 16:45.348
...but few stayed to bowl. I failed.

16:45.519 --> 16:49.848
Quitting my dream job
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.732
You did a great job, Homer.

16:51.942 --> 16:54.729
I'm really gonna miss you.
Place has never been cleaner.

16:54.903 --> 16:58.237
And the way you kept the young people
away, that was beautiful.

16:58.449 --> 17:00.157
Oh, yeah. Thanks for that.

17:00.367 --> 17:04.696
Anyway, we all pitched in, and we
got you this little going-away thing.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.127
This was the happiest time of my life.

17:12.296 --> 17:14.419
I'll never forget you guys.

17:14.589 --> 17:16.962
Especially you, Joey.

17:17.175 --> 17:19.548
- See you around, Mr. Homer.
- Don't worry, Joey.

17:19.720 --> 17:22.258
We'll make it to California someday.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.964
Sure, we will, Mr. Homer.
Sure, we will.

17:27.353 --> 17:29.926
It's gonna be sad around here
without you, Homer.

17:30.105 --> 17:32.228
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

17:35.270 --> 17:39.107
- Boy, this is depressing.
- I know what'd cheer us up. Bowling.

17:42.326 --> 17:44.484
Look at this, I got a ball here.

17:45.954 --> 17:48.446
- I feel happy now. Hey.
- Boy, this is fun.

17:48.665 --> 17:51.417
I needed more money to support
my growing family.

17:51.585 --> 17:56.580
And there was only one place in town
that a man like me could make it.

18:11.939 --> 18:14.477
Acid rain again.

18:30.582 --> 18:32.741
Yes? Are you a new applicant?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.827
- I quit, and I came to get my job back.
- Through there.

18:45.598 --> 18:48.515
So come crawling back, eh?

18:48.726 --> 18:52.593
Seems like the classy thing to do
would be not to call attention to it.

18:52.813 --> 18:57.226
- Thanks for giving me my old job back.
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.

18:57.401 --> 18:59.275
As punishment for your desertion...

18:59.445 --> 19:03.193
...it's company policy
to give you the plague.

19:03.407 --> 19:05.115
Sir, that's the "plaque."

19:05.325 --> 19:08.492
Yes, the special
de-motivational plaque...

19:08.662 --> 19:11.414
...to break what's left of your spirit.

19:11.582 --> 19:15.793
Because, you see,
you're here forever.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.430
"Don't forget: You're here forever."

19:27.431 --> 19:30.432
I've never been so miserable
in all my life.

19:30.601 --> 19:32.926
But I can't take it out
on Marge and the kids.

19:33.103 --> 19:36.638
I've gotta carry the burden
all by myself.

19:38.192 --> 19:40.564
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Well, actually...

19:40.736 --> 19:44.401
Oh, I can't go on with this charade.
I hate my job. I hate my life.

19:44.573 --> 19:47.657
Since I found out about this baby,
there's been only bad luck.

19:47.868 --> 19:50.157
My contractions started an hour ago.

19:50.371 --> 19:53.241
Just in one ear and out the other
with you, isn't it?

19:55.334 --> 19:58.667
This is incredible.
It's God's most wondrous miracle.

19:58.837 --> 20:01.245
Sir, I think your wife
wants to hold the baby.

20:01.423 --> 20:03.879
My wife? Where? Where?

20:05.511 --> 20:08.200
Congratulations. It's a boy.

20:09.306 --> 20:12.675
You're truly the catch of the day.

20:13.394 --> 20:16.395
It's wonderful. It's magical. Oh, boy.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.315
Here it comes, another mouth.

20:19.525 --> 20:21.601
One more push should do it.

20:21.777 --> 20:23.485
Marvelous.

20:27.320 --> 20:31.112
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.
You have a beautiful, healthy baby.

20:31.328 --> 20:33.784
Okay.

20:37.501 --> 20:40.122
Homie, I think someone
is saying hello.

20:40.337 --> 20:41.452
Hello.

20:43.632 --> 20:46.966
It's a boy. And what a boy!

20:47.761 --> 20:50.846
That's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.

20:51.560 --> 20:56.510
A girl. Oh, Marge,
we have a wonderful baby girl.

20:56.228 --> 21:01.768
Not just a girl. The most beautiful
baby girl in the whole world.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.394
Come on, Marge,
show a little enthusiasm.

21:14.330 --> 21:16.536
So you loved her right from the start.

21:18.417 --> 21:19.959
Absolutely.

21:20.169 --> 21:23.454
- Then why no pictures?
- Oh, there are pictures.

21:23.672 --> 21:26.757
I keep them where I need
the most cheering up.
