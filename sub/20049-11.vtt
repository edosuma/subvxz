[theme music playing]

00:26.980 --> 00:30.529
[Hannah]
I’ve told you about two
of the worst decisions I ever made,

00:30.610 --> 00:32.180
and the damage /eﬁ‘ ben/no’...

00:35.110 --> 00:36.657
and the people who got hurt.

00:38.620 --> 00:40.235
There is one more story to tell...

00:42.040 --> 00:44.281
one more bad decision...

00:46.000 --> 00:47.706
and this one’s a// on me.

00:51.670 --> 00:52.625
/Vo...

00:53.260 --> 00:55.125
it wasn’t the decision to go to the party.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.170
Because how could I have known?

00:59.430 --> 01:00.840
But it was the same night.

01:01.350 --> 01:03.671
That same awfu/ night.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.647
Remember that story
I was saving for later?

01:13.030 --> 01:14.236
Well, this is it.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.236
And it’s all about you. . .

01:20.410 --> 01:21.616
Clay.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.132
How in the hell am I supposed
to listen to this?

01:43.220 --> 01:46.223
I think the asshole answer
is you put the headphones on,

01:46.310 --> 01:47.846
the cassette tape in,

01:47.940 --> 01:48.804
and you press play.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.765
That is the asshole answer, isn't it?

01:51.860 --> 01:52.975
Yeah, but it's true.

01:54.650 --> 01:55.480
I can't...

01:57.320 --> 01:58.400
be here.

02:00.070 --> 02:01.367
I can't listen here.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.326
[Hannah]
Go. Yeah, you ’re going.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.877
[laughs] What are you doing?

02:17.720 --> 02:20.177
[sighs] I need you to drive.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.593
-Where do you want to go?
-Just... anywhere.

02:24.140 --> 02:25.380
Somewhere else.

02:29.730 --> 02:33.063
[Hannah]
Clay, I know you ’re asking
yourself why you ’re on these tapes.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.811
What could you posSIb/y have done?

02:36.940 --> 02:39.909
What else could have happened
the night of Jessica ’5 party?

02:41.160 --> 02:44.118
Well, good luck with your fresh start.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.826
Good luck to you, party animal.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.325
I'm digging this role reversal,
by the way.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.166
Oh, yeah?

02:53.250 --> 02:55.912
You got this
rebel with a cause thing going on.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.216
Well...

02:58.510 --> 02:59.408
that's me.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.092
-Jeff's a good influence on you.
-You think?

03:05.180 --> 03:07.057
I mean, he got you to go to a party.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.880
You've done that before.

03:10.270 --> 03:11.225
I guess I have.

03:12.350 --> 03:13.396
But not this time.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.273
Part of me was saying, ’545k me again. ”

03:17.440 --> 03:18.520
Well, um...

03:19.190 --> 03:20.270
happy homeworking.

03:21.490 --> 03:23.026
Yeah. Thanks.

03:23.910 --> 03:25.320
If you'll excuse me, ma'am,

03:25.410 --> 03:27.981
this rebel is going to tear out
into the night on his sweet ride.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.588
-But part of me was saying, ”Don ’t go. ”
-[Clay] Onward!

03:42.510 --> 03:43.750
Not even for Clay.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.380
I should ha ye listened to that pad“ of me.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.557
See, I never told you, Clay,

03:49.640 --> 03:51.517
but I ’ve always admired you.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.641
You are who you are, and you don ’t care.

03:56.150 --> 03:59.142
And I always cared
what other people thought of me,

03:59.230 --> 04:01.312
as much as I acted //ke I didn ’t.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.112
Is that a boy/girl thing,
or a Clay/Hannah thing?

04:11.370 --> 04:12.450
[sniffs]

04:17.500 --> 04:19.297
[Lainie] Well, don't you look nice.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.666
Off to the party?

04:21.300 --> 04:23.291
Uh, is that still okay?

04:23.380 --> 04:24.369
No, of course.

04:24.470 --> 04:27.257
It just started drizzling.
You sure you don't want a ride?

04:28.220 --> 04:31.269
Of the few things in life
I am sure of, that is one of them.

04:31.390 --> 04:32.800
Can I get you your rain poncho?

04:32.980 --> 04:34.800
I'm gonna let you guess the answer.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.391
-It's getting colder.
-I've got my hoodie. Bye, Mom.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.561
Be safe.

04:38.650 --> 04:39.639
Call me if you need a ride!

04:39.900 --> 04:41.356
Don't do any hard drugs!

04:41.440 --> 04:42.646
Or any drugs.

04:42.740 --> 04:43.775
Okay.

04:44.530 --> 04:45.849
[sighs]

04:47.120 --> 04:48.155
[sniffs]

04:50.200 --> 04:53.078
[Hannah]
I bet you also wish
you’d never gone to Jessica ’5.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.035
Right; Clay?

04:57.880 --> 04:58.869
[bell rings]

05:07.680 --> 05:08.499
Clay!

05:09.930 --> 05:11.215
Is the party over?

05:11.310 --> 05:13.016
The party hasn't started.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.261
No one's going to be here
for another hour.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.339
Oh.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.051
But I thought...
I heard it started at seven?

05:19.270 --> 05:20.259
Yeah.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.567
And, A, it's 6:55,

05:22.650 --> 05:25.232
and, B, seven really means nine.

05:25.900 --> 05:28.152
Oh, right. I'll come back.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.985
No, no, stay. You can help.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.206
Do you know how to tap a keg?

05:41.290 --> 05:44.703
Every guy's like, let's get a keg,
and when it's time to tap it--

05:44.800 --> 05:46.370
I told you it was the wrong kind of tap.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.506
I got this! Everybody settle!

05:48.590 --> 05:50.717
-I don't really know how to...
-Relax.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.381
You can do snacks.

05:53.390 --> 05:54.516
Got it.

05:54.850 --> 05:57.637
Is there any special order that you want?

05:57.730 --> 06:00.051
Mixed? All in separate bowls?

06:00.150 --> 06:01.606
Certain things mixed?

06:02.570 --> 06:03.889
Make a choice, Clay.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.026
Be bold.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.429
[rock music playing over a stereo]

06:12.280 --> 06:14.111
Dude. You came.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.782
What's up, Jeff?
I've actually been here for awhile.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.950
You've come a long way, Clay.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.741
I think our work together...
you've made some real progress.

06:22.380 --> 06:23.244
[scoffs] Right.

06:23.340 --> 06:24.159
Thanks.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.160
[Hannah]
I bet you wish
you hadn ’t invited me.

06:33.050 --> 06:33.960
She coming?

06:34.640 --> 06:35.766
What? Who do you mean?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.469
Okay, man.

06:43.940 --> 06:44.759
Hey, Clay.

06:45.610 --> 06:47.646
Oh. Hey, Alex, what's up?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.521
It's a party,
so I'm pretending to have fun.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.109
Yeah.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.481
No, I'm actually here
as part of my ongoing plan.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.492
Gonna hang around Jessica enough
that she gets annoyed

06:58.580 --> 06:59.990
and falls back in love with me.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.570
I feel there's a logic flaw in that plan.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.535
It's love, it's not logic.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.667
[all chanting] Hannah! Hannah!

07:09.130 --> 07:10.040
Cool, Hannah came.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.086
Now we can annoy Jessica together.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.026
Uh, I have to leave.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.398
[Jeff] Hey, hey, hey.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.320
Slow down, man, where you going?

07:42.420 --> 07:44.490
I just, I gotta get up really early.

07:44.580 --> 07:45.626
Dude, Hannah's here.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.246
She is? That's_cool_.
Hope she has a nice time.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.798
You need to go in there and talk to her.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.542
She's talking to someone else. She's busy.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.846
That's your cue, man.

07:55.930 --> 07:56.999
That's your cue to cut in.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.170
-Take a swing.
-A swing?

07:59.850 --> 08:01.932
You've got a fat slider
in your sweet spot.

08:02.390 --> 08:05.473
You've got to swing the bat
through the strike zone and knock it out.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.937
See, I'm aware those are baseball terms.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.988
If I'm interpreting correctly,
given my batting average,

08:11.070 --> 08:13.948
I would wind up with a strikeout
and not a home run.

08:14.030 --> 08:15.566
Very good use of an extended metaphor.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.150
Oh, fuck me, Jensen!

08:17.240 --> 08:18.980
Get the hell in there, man!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.036
Now, okay?
Now or I'm gonna kick your ass.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.280
You'd never kick my ass.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.825
Don't tempt me.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.206
-How am I tempting you?
-Go talk to her, man.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.587
You're the reason she came.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.626
I don't know that.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.790
I think you do.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.005
Go on.

08:40.390 --> 08:41.300
Okay.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.681
Going in. Going in.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.186
-[indistinct chatter]
-[rock music continues]

09:11.050 --> 09:13.587
[Hannah]
I ’d talked to you
a m/llion times before, but...

09:14.630 --> 09:16.507
tonight was diﬁ‘erent; and...

09:17.510 --> 09:19.250
I didn ’t know what to say to you.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.387
But when you finally came up to me...

09:23.310 --> 09:25.346
you knew just how to break the ice.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.010
Hey.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.089
Hey.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.851
You're there on the couch.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.560
So I am.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.857
I mean, you... you came after all.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.895
I was feeling rebellious.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.696
Ah. So you finished your homework.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.361
That would sort of be
antithetical to the whole--

09:41.450 --> 09:42.986
Right, right. Yeah.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.115
[laughs]

09:45.580 --> 09:46.649
Uh, do you...

09:47.460 --> 09:48.279
Do you want a drink?

09:48.370 --> 09:50.952
I believe you promised me a drink,
in fact.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.797
And a ride on your bike.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.120
I did, didn't I?

09:54.210 --> 09:56.587
Which is a pretty big deal.

09:56.670 --> 09:58.171
I don't let just anybody ride my bike.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.046
Well, I look forward to it.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.038
Yeah, me too.

10:08.980 --> 10:10.891
I actually didn't ride my bike here,

10:10.980 --> 10:12.220
so we can't do that.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.771
So, but I'll go get the drinks.

10:14.860 --> 10:18.273
Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you
if it's cool.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.406
Cool.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.276
[Hannah]
I was so nervous that night

10:21.370 --> 10:22.769
but you made it seem so...

10:22.870 --> 10:24.235
Easy?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.615
Is she kidding me?

10:26.910 --> 10:28.116
I was shitting myself.

10:28.790 --> 10:29.779
Okay.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.793
But she's not telling the truth
about the way things happened.

10:34.460 --> 10:35.870
She’s telling
her
truth .

10:39.130 --> 10:41.086
Why do you always act like you know?

10:41.390 --> 10:42.379
Because I do.

10:42.470 --> 10:44.426
From the tapes, I know
her
truth.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.142
So, why do you have to be here, knowing?

10:51.190 --> 10:53.010
’Cause I don ’t know what
your
truth is.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.351
And I don't know what's gonna happen
when you find out hers.

10:58.820 --> 10:59.809
[phone rings]

11:09.210 --> 11:10.108
Hey, Mom.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.371
Hi, Clay, it's Mom.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.836
Yeah, I just said that.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.377
So you did. Yeah. Uh...

11:16.460 --> 11:17.950
So how was day one of your suspension?

11:18.050 --> 11:19.756
Did you manage to be productive?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.000
Yeah, no, definitely.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.256
I did some research.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.217
Good. Good.

11:25.390 --> 11:27.711
Listen, you and your dad
are on your own for dinner.

11:27.810 --> 11:29.095
Something came up here.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.589
Something...

11:31.690 --> 11:32.839
with Hannah's case?

11:34.020 --> 11:35.351
I'll tell you later ifI can.

11:35.440 --> 11:36.475
Um...

11:36.650 --> 11:38.311
There’s le/to ver chicken in the fridge,

11:38.400 --> 11:40.777
and roast beef for sandwiches.

11:40.860 --> 11:43.067
Lainie. Gary Bolan returning your call.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.360
Listen, I have to go,

11:45.450 --> 11:46.940
so be in touch with your dad, okay?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.280
-Su re.
-Bye.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.359
Bye.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.409
[dials phone]

11:57.420 --> 11:58.455
Gary?

11:58.550 --> 11:59.585
Hi.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.633
Listen, the Bakers considered
our offer to settle.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.506
And they've turned it down.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.420
They want to move forward with the trial.

12:08.430 --> 12:09.761
What, um...

12:09.850 --> 12:11.841
What happened? Was it the money?

12:12.020 --> 12:13.009
-Not enough?
-No.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.103
Lainie Jensen thinks
it's this lawyer they got.

12:16.190 --> 12:17.430
He's hungry.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.817
Thinks they could win.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.061
-I mean, what do they have?
-Hel| if I know.

12:23.150 --> 12:24.856
Have we found a smoking gun?

12:25.030 --> 12:26.816
School magazine. The graffiti.

12:26.910 --> 12:27.899
Yes.

12:28.450 --> 12:31.032
Lainie's concerned _
that we painted over It,

12:31.120 --> 12:33.111
says it could be construed
as destroying evidence.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.240
Destroying evidence.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.661
I'm not gonna let the school
go down at the hands

12:37.750 --> 12:41.584
of whatever disturbed sophomore
latched onto the term "Cum Dumpster."

12:42.800 --> 12:43.789
Okay?

12:43.880 --> 12:46.292
And I'm not gonna let them
pin this on our staff

12:46.390 --> 12:48.005
or on you and Jane and me.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.089
So...

12:49.510 --> 12:51.558
you think that this
is where they're headed?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.017
Apparently,
they've expedited the subpoenas.

12:54.770 --> 12:56.590
-For the kids?
-For all of us.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.009
You knew this was coming.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.521
Yeah.

13:01.610 --> 13:04.443
I mean, I suppose I hoped that...

13:05.610 --> 13:07.157
it wouldn't get this far.

13:09.780 --> 13:12.328
Those kids, they've been through a lot.

13:13.290 --> 13:15.702
They're about to go through some more.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.209
[door opens]

13:33.020 --> 13:35.591
So, are there any
dinner plans happening, or...?

13:36.140 --> 13:37.220
Good idea. Get me a beer.

13:37.310 --> 13:38.390
If you're hungry, babe,

13:38.480 --> 13:40.436
I'll give you a twenty,
you can go get us a pizza.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.148
We could have an actual delivery boy
come and bring it.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.857
They cut my cell phone service off again.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.272
The fuck. Get your dirty ass feet
off my notebook, man.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.821
What, you mean this notebook?

13:57.540 --> 13:59.531
-Don't you ever touch me.
-Get out of my house.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.621
-It's not your house.
-You think it's yours?

14:01.710 --> 14:02.790
-You pay rent?
-Do you?

14:02.880 --> 14:06.088
Jesus, you're like two little boys.
Put your dicks away.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.080
I want him out.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.750
Either he goes or I go.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.095
I'll get you a beer.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.266
Don't fuck with me, kid.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.958
Hey, it's me. Uh...

14:39.420 --> 14:42.662
Listen, I can't stay at my house tonight.

14:44.590 --> 14:46.455
Just call me back, okay?

14:48.470 --> 14:49.676
Call me back.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.810
[Bryce] Who's on the phone?

15:06.190 --> 15:07.179
Shed.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.736
Cheerleading bullshit.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.060
What are we gonna do next?

15:12.370 --> 15:13.906
Hmm. I don't know. You tell me.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.900
You're the woman
with the taste for danger.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.126
[cheering]

15:24.420 --> 15:26.126
Damn, Justin, get in there!

15:26.300 --> 15:28.757
-Oh! Uh...
-Okay, personal space!

15:30.840 --> 15:32.250
How's the hot tub at your place?

15:33.550 --> 15:34.596
Hot.

15:35.430 --> 15:38.012
-And the beer is cold.
-[chuckles]

15:38.270 --> 15:39.555
-Let's go.
-Yeah?

15:51.320 --> 15:55.063
[Hannah]
So, let’s start with the part
of the party that I left out.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.573
So, the idea is,
you can have a super power,

15:58.660 --> 16:00.150
but it has a drawback.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.070
For example, there's the triple take.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.992
You can freeze time when you want
for as long as you want,

16:05.080 --> 16:08.493
but once you unfreeze everyone else,
you're frozen three times as long.

16:08.590 --> 16:11.297
Okay, and you read this in a book?

16:11.760 --> 16:12.624
No, I made it up.

16:13.510 --> 16:15.592
For those real life situations

16:15.680 --> 16:17.887
where you wish you had a super power
to get you out of?

16:18.890 --> 16:21.597
If you had a super power,
what would you want to use it for?

16:23.480 --> 16:27.223
Well, technically, I'm not really
in a situation I want to get out of.

16:28.690 --> 16:31.238
Well, what kind of situation
are you in, then?

16:32.860 --> 16:35.818
I'm in a party situation.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.237
And if you could use
a super power right now,

16:40.330 --> 16:41.740
what would you want it to do?

16:44.420 --> 16:45.455
Uh...

16:47.710 --> 16:49.120
I would make...

16:50.630 --> 16:52.120
everyone else disappear.

16:53.550 --> 16:54.960
And then what would we do?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.589
Um...

17:00.060 --> 17:01.049
Well...

17:05.100 --> 17:06.647
we would--

17:06.730 --> 17:07.685
Oh!

17:08.860 --> 17:11.101
-Did he get you?
-Mostly dry.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.772
-Do you wanna maybe go--
-Say no more.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.560
Um... Let's...

17:20.540 --> 17:21.905
-[beer can hisses]
-Whoa.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.549
Sure.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.646
Wsum

17:47.730 --> 17:50.051
nice of Jeff to force you to come tonight.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.392
No, he didn't force me. He, uh...

17:53.070 --> 17:54.276
strongly recommended it.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.602
Didn't he also strongly recommend
you come to the dance?

17:58.490 --> 18:00.151
No, I lost a bet.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.946
-To Jeff?
-[chuckles]

18:03.370 --> 18:06.362
So the only time you and I actually
ever get to hang out is...

18:07.250 --> 18:08.285
because of Jeff?

18:08.460 --> 18:09.870
No, no. I mean...

18:11.920 --> 18:12.739
Maybe.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.705
Kind of.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.665
But it's strictly coincidental.

18:18.930 --> 18:20.170
[beer pong ball bounces]

18:24.390 --> 18:27.268
If it's strictly coincidental,
then why is he watching us?

18:29.650 --> 18:32.437
I mean, he does take
an interest in my social life.

18:33.690 --> 18:34.850
Uh-huh. SO...

18:34.940 --> 18:38.148
you tutor him in academics,
and he tutors you in...

18:38.700 --> 18:39.689
Girls.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.569
Girl.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.246
Singular.

18:50.670 --> 18:51.819
[Troy] Hannah!

18:52.380 --> 18:53.449
Clay!

18:53.710 --> 18:54.836
Hey, Troy.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.331
You two are gonna come over there...

18:59.340 --> 19:00.887
and you're gonna play beer pong.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.289
Uh...

19:02.390 --> 19:05.928
Actually, I'm not really
big into sports with balls.

19:07.220 --> 19:09.017
All sports have balls.

19:09.390 --> 19:11.847
Uh, no, actually, they don't.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.930
Oh, they totally don't.

19:14.110 --> 19:15.600
Troy, buddy!

19:16.320 --> 19:18.606
We're gonna leave these kids alone
for the rest of the night.

19:18.780 --> 19:19.769
And you're beer-ponging.

19:19.860 --> 19:20.849
Whoo!

19:20.950 --> 19:22.099
Beer pong!

19:27.240 --> 19:28.320
Do you want to...

19:30.250 --> 19:31.285
Yeah.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.580
It's, like, easier to talk at work.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.557
Except for all the people
who want to watch a movie.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.886
Or eat popcorn. Very annoying.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.347
-They should do that somewhere else.
-Don't you think?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.182
I'm thinking of starting
a petition at change.org.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.516
I'm going to contact my Congressperson.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.679
[laughs]

19:58.190 --> 19:59.179
Yeah.

20:00.110 --> 20:03.694
The thing is, I think I'm gonna have
to quit working at the Crestmont.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.738
-Why?
-My parents need me to work at the store.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.992
Which kind of sucks, because I really
like working at the Crestmont.

20:13.710 --> 20:14.779
I do too.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.832
What I mean is, I like working with you.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.883
Well, if you work at your parents' store,

20:28.970 --> 20:30.517
you won't smell like burned popcorn.

20:31.890 --> 20:32.936
Yeah.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.641
[door opens]

20:34.730 --> 20:35.719
[laughing]

20:44.530 --> 20:45.940
Do you want to talk in there?

20:47.490 --> 20:48.320
[Clay]
Stop.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.617
-I've got to stop.
-You want me to stop the car?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.194
No. Yes! No, no.

20:52.290 --> 20:54.167
What does she say next?

20:54.710 --> 20:56.371
I mean, does she say what she did?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.035
Does she say why?

20:58.130 --> 20:59.119
She does.

21:02.170 --> 21:05.128
So, Justin, Zach, Alex,

21:05.220 --> 21:06.505
they all heard this?

21:06.890 --> 21:08.289
And Ryan and Tyler?

21:09.350 --> 21:10.385
Of course.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.549
Of course.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.732
I'm just like everyone else.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.742
[Mrs. Dempsey] You have more points
and more rebounds than Justin.

21:33.910 --> 21:35.821
I don't know why you're not captain.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.127
That's not how they choose captain, Mom.

21:38.580 --> 21:39.911
I don't even want to be captain.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.830
You're the best player.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.626
-That's right.
-[text alert]

21:43.710 --> 21:44.790
That's what matters.

21:46.840 --> 21:47.886
Justin's just...

21:50.010 --> 21:51.557
He's just going through some stuff.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.846
He'll be back.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.433
[man] So, like you do,
you go outside to work things out.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.489
The bouncer gets in between us,
and this kid pops him in the face.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.361
-He did not. Wow.
-Yeah.

22:09.450 --> 22:11.270
So, my job's basically done.

22:11.370 --> 22:14.407
I let the bouncer do his work,
I go back inside to my beer.

22:14.830 --> 22:15.956
Good job.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.320
Alex got into something the other day.

22:19.420 --> 22:20.830
Yeah, I saw that.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.660
It was nothing. It was stupid.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.376
Didn't look like nothing.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.547
I've got a family of brawlers,
that's what I got here.

22:28.050 --> 22:30.587
Trying to keep you two
on the right side of the law.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.715
[door bell rings]

22:32.260 --> 22:33.249
I'll get that.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.267
Your mom's gonna be glad to see you.

22:38.690 --> 22:40.089
Um... hey?

22:41.020 --> 22:42.260
Look, I'm sorry to...

22:44.070 --> 22:45.059
Can I...

22:46.650 --> 22:48.197
Is it all right if I crash here tonight?

22:49.360 --> 22:50.349
Seriously?

22:50.450 --> 22:53.362
Yeah, I know, but Jessica, Zach...

22:53.950 --> 22:56.327
they won't answer my texts,
my calls, anything.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.150
Why don't you stay at Bryce's?

22:59.370 --> 23:00.667
I think you know why.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.871
Look, I can sleep in the garage.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.621
No, man, that's weird.

23:06.710 --> 23:07.916
You're not a hobo.

23:08.050 --> 23:10.462
Your parents don't have to know.
I can climb to your window.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.959
[father] Alex, who is it?

23:17.730 --> 23:20.437
Hey, Dad, it's um... Justin.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.398
Is it okay if he spends the night?
We have some homework we have to do.

23:23.480 --> 23:25.607
-Sure. How you doing, Justin?
-Good, sir.

23:25.690 --> 23:27.271
Good. How's the team this year?

23:27.360 --> 23:29.396
Uh, good.
I think we have a shot this year.

23:29.490 --> 23:31.651
Excellent. You eat dinner?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.980
Uh... No, not yet.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.617
Come on in. We got leftovers,

23:36.700 --> 23:38.440
we got steak, we got all the fixings.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.319
[sighs]

23:41.040 --> 23:42.166
Have you met Peter before?

23:42.330 --> 23:43.456
[knocking at door]

23:44.920 --> 23:46.239
-Pam.
-[chuckles]

23:46.340 --> 23:47.329
Working late.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.500
You too.

23:48.590 --> 23:51.718
Hey, I got Gary's e-mail
about the Baker lawsuit.

23:51.970 --> 23:53.130
We might be deposed?

23:53.220 --> 23:55.541
Yeah, the lawyers think it's likely.

23:57.510 --> 23:58.807
Likely? Wow.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.937
Are you concerned
about something in particular?

24:07.270 --> 24:10.103
Listen, it might be nothing, but...

24:10.570 --> 24:12.856
last year, at the end of the year,

24:12.950 --> 24:14.941
we had an anonymous note

24:15.030 --> 24:17.021
for me, for the class.

24:17.580 --> 24:20.196
It didn't mention suicide specifically,

24:20.290 --> 24:22.531
but it was someone who was despondent.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.122
Now I'm wondering
if it was written by Hannah.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.161
Do you have reason to believe it was?

24:29.340 --> 24:31.001
Clay Jensen said it was.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.797
Clay Jensen?
When did he say this?

24:34.010 --> 24:35.045
Just a few days ago.

24:35.220 --> 24:38.599
He didn't say
why he thought that way, but...

24:39.060 --> 24:40.049
Did you ask him?

24:40.140 --> 24:42.472
I intended to,
but he's out for three days.

24:42.690 --> 24:43.679
Yeah.

24:44.690 --> 24:47.932
We should see what we can find out
when he gets back,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.477
or if you hear anything else
from the other kids.

24:50.570 --> 24:51.434
For the lawsuit?

24:51.990 --> 24:54.276
For the lawsuit, for the kids...

24:54.950 --> 24:56.906
and, unless someone asks...

24:57.570 --> 25:00.482
it might be best not to be sharing this.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.911
[stammers] Sure, you're right.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.239
Yeah.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.417
Let me know if you hear anything else.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.869
Of course.

25:11.050 --> 25:12.039
[text alert]

25:16.090 --> 25:17.796
My wife. I'm late again.

25:24.230 --> 25:25.845
Hey, man, you could choke, so...

25:26.810 --> 25:28.516
So, like, don't choke.

25:29.770 --> 25:31.647
This steak is the shit.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.483
-Your clad cooks?
-My mom cooks. My dad, he grills.

25:35.740 --> 25:37.560
-It's so fucking good!
-Yeah.

25:37.910 --> 25:39.195
Where is your mom?

25:39.410 --> 25:40.729
She's at the hospital.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.485
She does four days on, four off.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.156
They're 12-hour shifts.

25:44.250 --> 25:45.456
[phone rings]

25:48.040 --> 25:49.496
Jess, what took you so long?

25:50.040 --> 25:52.793
Serious/y, Justin, now you ’re all
concerned about what I ’m doing?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.329
I'm sorry about today.

25:56.050 --> 25:57.369
[Bryce]
Is that Justy?

25:58.050 --> 25:59.460
Are you with Bryce?

26:00.470 --> 26:01.960
What the hell are you doing?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.715
[Jessica]
We ’re hanging out at his place.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.220
[Bryce]
Tell him to get over here!

26:05.310 --> 26:07.346
Who else is there?
Is anyone else there With you?

26:07.440 --> 26:09.089
[Jessica]
Who are you, my dad?

26:09.980 --> 26:11.470
Come meet me at Alex's.

26:11.610 --> 26:13.146
I gotta go, Justin.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.565
Jess, do not hang up.

26:14.650 --> 26:15.685
[line disconnects]

26:17.650 --> 26:18.901
Hey, what's going on?

26:21.490 --> 26:23.196
We need to go to Bryce's.
Can you drive?

26:29.210 --> 26:31.075
-I need to throw up.
-Okay.

26:31.460 --> 26:34.122
-I don't have anything to throw up.
-You need some food.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.917
-So I can throw it up?
-So you can settle the fuck down.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.460
My mother used to say:

26:38.550 --> 26:40.336
’Primero comemos, entonces lo dems. ”

26:40.430 --> 26:42.807
That means, "first we eat,
then we do everything else."

26:45.350 --> 26:46.977
I'll bet she's big on breakfast.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.313
I've got a prosciutto mozzarella
with red peppers.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.389
Thank you.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.983
And a plain turkey
with a tiny dab of mayo,

26:58.200 --> 26:59.736
and an even tinier dab of mustard.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.855
[Tony laughs]

27:01.110 --> 27:02.156
Thank you.

27:03.490 --> 27:04.980
No triple Americano for you?

27:07.330 --> 27:08.365
No, I'll just...

27:09.920 --> 27:11.569
I'll just get some water or something.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.877
Oh, my God. Sit.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.120
I'll get it.

27:16.710 --> 27:17.756
Wow.

27:18.300 --> 27:19.756
She doesn't do that for anybody.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.553
I'm ready to keep listening.
We don't have to waste more time.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.925
Eat your food.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.841
-I can't.
-Don't act like a child. Eat.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.226
Stop talking like my grandpa.

27:32.310 --> 27:34.107
You need to be in the right headspace.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.726
How can I be in the right headspace

27:35.820 --> 27:37.640
to find out why I caused a girl
to kill herself?

27:42.740 --> 27:43.729
Thank you.

27:45.120 --> 27:45.984
Wow.

27:46.910 --> 27:47.899
Rough night?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.537
-He's working through some shit.
-[Skye] I can see that.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.418
He's got existential crisis
written on his forehead.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.746
I do not.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.621
There's some truth you don't want to face.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.176
Why did you say that?

28:01.840 --> 28:03.080
I see the future.

28:03.430 --> 28:05.637
You know that.
I told you your fortune In 7th grade.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.630
You predicted I wouldn't be 5' 2" forever.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.340
How tall are you now?

28:10.600 --> 28:11.510
See?

28:11.600 --> 28:12.840
Ooh...

28:13.190 --> 28:14.896
-ia bruja.
-That's right.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.937
I got my cards here,
if you want a reading.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.563
-I'm good.
-Maybe there's even a message from beyond.

28:23.780 --> 28:24.906
What are you saying?

28:25.780 --> 28:27.190
Take a reading and you'll find out.

28:28.490 --> 28:29.400
All right.

28:30.330 --> 28:31.615
Seriously?

28:31.830 --> 28:33.115
Don't mock what you don't know.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.781
I am Catholic.
I know all about this mystical bullshit.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.449
First you shuffle.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.461
[Clay]
Is this so I know you're not cheating?

28:43.550 --> 28:45.086
There's no winning or losing.

28:45.340 --> 28:47.717
You shuffle to transfer
your energy to the cards.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.806
Now cut the deck.

29:24.840 --> 29:25.920
So, uh...

29:26.010 --> 29:27.420
what do the cards say?

29:28.050 --> 29:30.803
This one, nine of wands,
but it's reversed,

29:30.890 --> 29:33.427
which means you feel
the world is against you.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.760
-Rea|ly?
-Seems right.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.555
Like accusing people of ratting you out.

29:37.230 --> 29:38.219
I didn't mean to--

29:38.310 --> 29:40.187
The hermit. Also reversed.

29:40.690 --> 29:42.567
You're isolated. Alone.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.691
Big deal. Everybody's alone.

29:44.860 --> 29:46.600
A very un-Clay Jensen thing to say.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.150
Ten of swords.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.782
You keep falling back
into the pain of the past.

29:51.950 --> 29:56.068
You can't face your sadness, your fear.
You can't move on.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.700
What the hell are you doing?

29:57.790 --> 29:59.872
-Page of cups.
-You're talking about Hannah.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.337
The cards are showing someone
struggling inside.

30:03.550 --> 30:04.539
Tortured.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.119
Emotionally.

30:06.220 --> 30:07.289
Why are you so pissed at me?

30:07.970 --> 30:09.335
I'm just reading your cards.

30:09.430 --> 30:12.593
I don't get how you're mad at me.
You stopped talking to me freshman year.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.229
Really? First day of school,
you didn't see me then turn the other way?

30:17.390 --> 30:19.438
Well... I didn't know what to say.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.397
How about, "Hey, Skye, how's it going?"

30:21.610 --> 30:23.851
You just... you changed.

30:23.940 --> 30:25.237
Yeah, so did you.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.480
You used to be cool.

30:26.570 --> 30:27.639
You used to be nice.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.651
We can't all be nice girls like Sheri.

30:29.820 --> 30:31.026
Or Hannah.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.651
Why talk shit about Hannah?
What did she do to you?

30:34.750 --> 30:36.741
-Besides ignore me?
-You were jealous of her.

30:36.910 --> 30:39.367
Why would I be jealous of a dead girl?

30:39.540 --> 30:40.916
What she did was stupid.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.456
You don't know anything about it.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.622
She didn't go through anything
different than any of us.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.370
-We all get through it.
-Yeah?

30:49.550 --> 30:50.710
Then what's that?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.096
It's what you do
instead of killing yourself.

30:57.930 --> 30:59.181
Suicide is for the weak.

31:06.610 --> 31:08.020
[Clay]
I mean, what a...

31:08.280 --> 31:09.486
what a bitch!

31:09.650 --> 31:10.651
Wow.

31:10.740 --> 31:11.980
Well, she is!

31:12.070 --> 31:13.947
I never heard you use that word before.

31:14.030 --> 31:16.032
She_doesn'_t know what _was
gomg on In Hannah's life.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.747
You don't know what's going on in hers.

31:18.790 --> 31:20.075
Would you...

31:20.580 --> 31:22.377
you know, shut up, Tony?

31:22.460 --> 31:26.339
I get so sick of your little sayings,
and things you point out, acting all wise.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.718
You're like this unhelpful Yoda.

31:29.380 --> 31:30.711
Is that a crack on my height?

31:36.430 --> 31:38.011
Whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.265
Why?

31:39.430 --> 31:41.432
Headspace. Headspace.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.977
Unhelpful Yoda. Unhelpful Yoda.

31:45.150 --> 31:47.436
-Just let me out.
-I'm not gonna leave you alone.

31:47.610 --> 31:49.100
I will let you get some air.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.349
I know a place.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.275
Shh...

31:56.370 --> 31:57.405
Hey.

31:57.910 --> 31:59.650
[whispers] Kevin, where have you been?

31:59.750 --> 32:01.957
I've been texting and calling for hours.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.621
I had the ringer off.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.166
What's going on?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.331
You were supposed to relieve the sitter.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.876
I had parent conferences today.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.507
She left the house a mess.

32:10.590 --> 32:13.332
First time in two hours
this baby's stopped crying.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.671
-I'm afraid to put him down.
-I'll take him.

32:15.850 --> 32:19.013
-If he gets upset again...
-He won't. Come on, baby.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.977
Come on. All right.

32:21.850 --> 32:23.090
Okay, buddy.

32:23.190 --> 32:24.179
[exhales]

32:26.020 --> 32:27.066
Is he teething?

32:27.150 --> 32:30.278
I don't know, but I've got drool
all the way down my back.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.519
I'm sorry.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.691
I'm sorry about tonight, you know.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.189
But...

32:38.290 --> 32:40.531
the pressure is on me at school right now.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.953
You need to find a balance.
Take some pressure off of you.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.326
I could lose my job.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.541
You're not gonna lose your job.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.165
How do you know?

32:50.670 --> 32:51.796
Babe,

32:52.170 --> 32:54.582
you had no idea that girl was suffering.

32:54.930 --> 32:57.216
You can't blame yourself for what she did.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.557
What if I could?

33:00.100 --> 33:01.306
I know you can't.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.456
Now I'll let you out.

33:26.210 --> 33:27.199
[engine stops]

33:29.960 --> 33:31.507
It's fine in here.

33:32.920 --> 33:33.966
Okay.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.336
I'll be right here if you need me.

34:13.710 --> 34:14.699
[Clay] What?

34:14.800 --> 34:15.789
[laughs]

34:16.130 --> 34:18.587
She has a rock collection
from when she was little.

34:18.970 --> 34:21.291
She used to water them
and treat them as pets.

34:21.890 --> 34:23.266
How do you know?

34:23.560 --> 34:25.767
We were friends
at the beginning of last year.

34:26.770 --> 34:28.397
It was fun while it lasted.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.300
I didn't know you guys were friends.

34:30.770 --> 34:32.010
She's so...

34:32.110 --> 34:33.395
popular.

34:34.150 --> 34:35.890
Yes, thank you, Clay.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.270
Well, no, I mean...

34:37.360 --> 34:38.349
No, it's...

34:38.450 --> 34:39.519
I know what you mean.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.578
Yeah, but she can actually
be pretty cool and funny.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.991
I mean, she still has her rocks.

34:47.160 --> 34:48.206
Yes.

34:48.790 --> 34:51.998
I guess an advantage of pet rocks
is that they don't die.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.706
Mmm. Yeah.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.449
They don't eat too much.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.625
And they don't crap on the floor.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.709
[laughs]

35:00.390 --> 35:01.926
Oh, I'm killing her pets.

35:02.010 --> 35:02.999
[laughing]

35:04.180 --> 35:05.556
What's that one's name?

35:06.810 --> 35:08.471
I think we should name him Stone.

35:09.810 --> 35:11.687
Is that his first name or last name?

35:12.690 --> 35:13.679
Both.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.317
His name is Stone Stone.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.776
-Stone Stone.
-Yeah.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.480
Oh, my God.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.576
Your name is Clay.

35:23.660 --> 35:24.695
Yes.

35:24.780 --> 35:25.781
[laughs]

35:25.870 --> 35:27.747
-It is, and I've heard all the jokes.
-Rea|ly?

35:27.830 --> 35:29.400
All the jokes in the universe, ever?

35:29.500 --> 35:30.535
All of them.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.206
That's impressive.

35:32.540 --> 35:34.087
I like the name Clay.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.206
I like the name Hannah.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.636
["A 1000 Times" playing]

35:46.720 --> 35:50.178
I had a dream that you were mine

35:50.810 --> 35:53.301
Ive had that dream

35:53.400 --> 35:55.140
A thousand times...

35:55.320 --> 35:56.776
[Hannah]
At that moment. . .

35:57.150 --> 35:59.141
everything was perfect.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.697
And for the first time in a long t/me...

36:03.700 --> 36:05.941
I could imagine a future
where I was happy.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.946
I left my room. . .

36:09.660 --> 36:11.241
How good life could be.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.991
I walked from noon

36:14.080 --> 36:16.332
Unt/l the night

36:16.500 --> 36:19.298
I changed my crowd

36:19.380 --> 36:21.871
I ditched my tie

36:21.970 --> 36:24.291
I watched the sparks

36:24.390 --> 36:26.130
Fly off the fire

36:26.720 --> 36:28.381
[Hannah]
And I know you felt it too.

36:29.390 --> 36:32.097
I didn’t even try

36:32.190 --> 36:34.841
Theyd closed the shutters

36:34.940 --> 36:37.431
Theyd pulled the blinds

36:37.520 --> 36:39.977
My eyes are red

36:40.070 --> 36:42.356
The streets are bright...

36:42.530 --> 36:43.599
This okay?

36:43.740 --> 36:45.276
Yeah. More than okay.

36:45.410 --> 36:47.696
Were black and white

36:48.790 --> 36:53.568
The 10th of No vember

36:54.000 --> 36:57.879
The year’s almost over. . .

36:58.670 --> 37:01.047
I wanted you to do
everything you were doing...

37:03.510 --> 37:06.252
so I don ’t know why my mind
took me everywhere eise.

37:08.010 --> 37:10.137
And I thought of every other guy.

37:10.350 --> 37:12.671
[Montgomery]
Did Justin finger you?
I bet you went down on h/m.

I mean, you made the hot list.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.817
They said you had the best...

37:19.900 --> 37:21.856
[Montgomery]
I hear you two
l/ke a guy between you.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.022
Did Justin finger you?
I bet you went down on h/m.

37:24.110 --> 37:26.522
-[Hannah]
And they all became you.
-[ Cla y]
Sometimes it’s better to wait.

37:26.780 --> 37:27.769
Thought you were easy.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.691
[voices continue, echoing]

37:32.830 --> 37:33.785
Stop it!

37:34.330 --> 37:35.786
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:35.870 --> 37:37.622
No, just stop, okay?

37:37.710 --> 37:38.699
Did I hurt you?

37:38.790 --> 37:39.916
No, just don't.

37:41.710 --> 37:42.790
I mean, what...

37:43.970 --> 37:45.005
what happened?

37:46.180 --> 37:47.386
I thought it was okay.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.593
-Hannah, I'm so sorry--
-Just leave me alone.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.136
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.101
You should just go.

38:02.150 --> 38:03.640
[Hannah]
Part of me was saying. ..

38:05.200 --> 38:06.599
’P/ease don ’t lea ve. ”

38:08.030 --> 38:10.362
Part of me never wanted to see you again.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.987
-You all right?
-I don't want you here. Get out.

38:16.870 --> 38:18.030
Hannah".

38:18.120 --> 38:19.451
Get the fuck out!

38:23.380 --> 38:26.008
-[door opens, shuts]
-But you walked out the door...

38:26.840 --> 38:28.250
l/ke I told you to.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.000
Why did you have to leave?

38:34.770 --> 38:36.510
It was the worst thing ever.

38:37.350 --> 38:38.590
[knocking at door]

38:40.020 --> 38:41.396
[Jessica laughing]

38:50.070 --> 38:51.697
And then it got worse.

38:51.780 --> 38:52.940
[laughing continues]

38:58.120 --> 38:59.280
[Hannah]
Clay...

39:01.250 --> 39:02.239
Helmet...

39:04.250 --> 39:07.128
your name does not belong on this list

39:08.840 --> 39:11.502
But you need to be here
ifI’m going to tell my story.

39:14.060 --> 39:17.268
If I ’m going to explain
whyI did whatI did.

39:20.770 --> 39:22.601
Because you aren ’t every other guy.

39:24.650 --> 39:25.856
You ’re different

39:27.650 --> 39:29.356
You ’re good and kind . .

39:30.150 --> 39:31.356
and decent.

39:34.030 --> 39:36.658
And I didn ’t deserve to be
with someone like you.

39:36.740 --> 39:37.741
No.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.490
I never would.

39:42.460 --> 39:44.087
I would have ruined you.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.370
It wasn ’t you.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.079
It was me.. .

39:51.010 --> 39:53.046
and everything that’s happened to me.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.226
Goddamn it!

40:08.780 --> 40:09.895
-You knew.
-Whoa. ..

40:10.400 --> 40:12.311
-You knew all along.
-Knew what?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.059
That all of this is my fault.

40:14.740 --> 40:15.729
How did I know that?

40:15.910 --> 40:17.946
I-I just left Hannah. I left her there.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.940
She needed me, and I walked away.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.860
You were doing what she told you to do.

40:21.960 --> 40:22.858
No, I ran.

40:23.370 --> 40:25.201
I was scared.
I thought it was something I had done

40:25.290 --> 40:26.336
or something I didn't understand,

40:26.420 --> 40:29.207
because I'm this fucking loser
who doesn't know anything about girls

40:29.300 --> 40:32.178
-or about life or anything.
-So all of this is your fault?

40:32.260 --> 40:33.329
I left!

40:33.640 --> 40:36.541
I knew I shouldn't have left.
And then Bryce raped Jessica.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.348
Hannah saw,
then Sheri knocked down the stop sign,

40:39.430 --> 40:41.762
then Jeff died,
and it all started with me!

40:42.980 --> 40:43.935
Clay.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.680
I think you gotta get back from that edge.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.066
Why?

40:49.530 --> 40:52.067
Why shouldn't I just jump, just let go?

40:52.240 --> 40:53.059
So you can die?

40:54.030 --> 40:56.487
-Reunite with Hannah forever?
-Fuck you, Tony.

40:56.660 --> 40:58.616
You think you could have changed anything?

40:58.700 --> 41:00.531
What does that make you? God?

41:00.870 --> 41:02.201
I should have stayed with Hannah.

41:02.370 --> 41:03.701
She told you to go.

41:03.790 --> 41:05.746
-I should've told her, should've said--
-What?

41:05.830 --> 41:08.162
You think you could have
changed any of this?

41:08.250 --> 41:09.296
I could have said...

41:09.960 --> 41:11.040
"I'm not going."

41:11.130 --> 41:12.870
She said, "Get the hell out of here."

41:12.970 --> 41:14.870
No. No, I won't go.

41:14.970 --> 41:16.085
-Get out.
-No.

41:16.180 --> 41:17.215
[Tony] Get the fuck out!

41:17.300 --> 41:18.506
Not until you tell me what's wrong.

41:18.850 --> 41:21.262
-Not until you tell me what's wrong.
-Leave me alone!

41:21.640 --> 41:23.596
Okay, just leave me alone, Clay.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.685
You should just go.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.066
I thought it was okay.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.696
I don't want you here. Get out.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.827
-Hannah”.
-Get the fuck out!

41:40.950 --> 41:42.326
Okay. I'll go.

41:44.620 --> 41:47.453
But tell me what's going on, okay?
Tell me what's wrong.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.199
You don't want to be with me.

41:51.380 --> 41:52.449
But I do.

41:52.670 --> 41:55.252
-I really do.
-You know what people will say?

41:55.340 --> 41:56.500
No.

41:56.970 --> 41:57.959
And I don't care.

41:58.090 --> 42:00.001
Because it's easy for you, right?

42:00.220 --> 42:02.051
Because you're not the class slut.

42:02.930 --> 42:05.137
-Don't say that.
-Everybody says it!

42:05.230 --> 42:06.879
-I don't say it.
-Yes, you did.

42:07.310 --> 42:08.766
When you saw that picture!

42:09.310 --> 42:10.641
I didn't believe it.

42:13.610 --> 42:15.896
I was angry for a minute because...

42:17.570 --> 42:19.447
because I was jealous of Justin.

42:22.160 --> 42:25.118
And I was mad at you
for wanting him and not me.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.416
And I was an asshole,

42:27.500 --> 42:28.569
and I'm sorry.

42:29.630 --> 42:32.417
And I can never make it right,

42:32.500 --> 42:34.456
I can never say all this to you, but...

42:35.630 --> 42:37.006
I love you.

42:42.930 --> 42:44.636
And I will never hurt you.

42:44.850 --> 42:45.976
Clay.

42:46.680 --> 42:47.886
I'm not going.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.549
Not now.

42:53.570 --> 42:54.559
Not ever.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.947
I love you, Hannah.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.957
Why didn't you say this to me
when I was alive?

43:47.290 --> 43:48.689
[sobbing] I couldn't...

43:51.710 --> 43:53.246
I couldn't tell her.

43:54.710 --> 43:56.371
I couldn't hold her.

44:00.130 --> 44:01.540
I killed Hannah Baker.

44:02.340 --> 44:03.466
Like you said.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.710
I said we all killed Hannah.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.051
How am I supposed to live with that?

44:12.350 --> 44:13.681
Any way you can.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.372
-[Jessica] Again and again!
-Just take the money.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.007
[Jessica] And fucking again.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.660
What? Yeah, that's mine.

44:41.760 --> 44:43.125
That's, like, twice.

44:43.300 --> 44:45.131
[Jessica]
This is embarrassing at this point.

44:45.220 --> 44:47.347
[Bryce] You want to rub it in now?

44:47.430 --> 44:50.092
You finally win, once!

44:50.180 --> 44:52.307
-I am so fucking rich!
-Whatever.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.339
Justy! Alex!

44:54.440 --> 44:55.850
About fucking time, you guys.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.102
[Bryce] These cards are getting stale.
Come on, sit down.

44:58.190 --> 44:59.646
Jess and I had this thing planned.

44:59.730 --> 45:02.392
-[scoffs] No, we don't.
-We were gonna get late dinner.

45:04.410 --> 45:06.560
-Let's go.
-When did you tell me about dinner?

45:06.660 --> 45:08.901
Was that before or after
you walked out on me today?

45:11.160 --> 45:11.990
Oh.

45:12.330 --> 45:15.072
Justin, sounds like
you'd better make it up to her...

45:15.420 --> 45:17.786
by losing a few hands. Come on, sit.

45:19.380 --> 45:20.199
[coughs]

45:21.420 --> 45:24.253
All right, well, uh,
the game is Texas Hold 'Em.

45:24.340 --> 45:26.422
Five dollar ante,
five dollar minimum bet.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.386
[Bryce] Don't worry I got you staked.

45:29.720 --> 45:32.553
Your girlfriend's been playing
with my money all night anyway.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.266
Alex, sit down.

45:34.640 --> 45:35.641
No, I'm good.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.009
I hate poker.

45:37.100 --> 45:39.978
No, you have to play.
Everybody's playing. Come on.

45:40.230 --> 45:41.310
Here.

45:43.650 --> 45:44.480
Whoa.

45:45.820 --> 45:46.980
Jess, what the fuck?

45:48.410 --> 45:49.274
Your deal.

45:49.950 --> 45:51.531
I don't want to fuckin' play cards.

45:51.700 --> 45:52.997
I said your deal!

45:53.660 --> 45:54.615
Jess.

45:54.790 --> 45:56.200
Shit.

45:57.000 --> 45:57.955
Fuck it!

45:58.130 --> 45:59.119
Let's go.

46:02.670 --> 46:05.548
-Jess, I said let's go. Come on.
-What the fuck, Justin!

46:05.840 --> 46:07.000
Shit.

46:07.180 --> 46:09.887
We're leaving now.
I don't want you hanging out here again.

46:09.970 --> 46:11.176
Don't touch me like that!

46:11.260 --> 46:12.716
Don't you ever touch me like that!

46:12.890 --> 46:15.176
-Buddy, calm down.
-Stay the fuck away from her.

46:15.270 --> 46:16.806
What is your problem, Justin?

46:16.980 --> 46:18.800
Guys, this does not need to happen.

46:18.900 --> 46:19.889
Maybe it does.

46:19.980 --> 46:21.516
What are you doing here?

46:21.610 --> 46:23.020
What are you doing here with him?

46:23.110 --> 46:24.236
We're just having fun.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.197
Why the fuck are you here with Bryce?

46:26.360 --> 46:27.520
[Jessica] Why do you care?

46:27.700 --> 46:28.815
Tell me!

46:29.490 --> 46:31.367
-Tell her, Justin.
-Alex.

46:31.530 --> 46:32.531
Let's go.

46:32.620 --> 46:34.360
-Tell me why you care.
-Let's go.

46:34.450 --> 46:36.281
Tell me why you fucking care!

46:36.370 --> 46:38.076
Because he fucking raped you!

46:44.510 --> 46:45.909
Justin, brother...

46:46.010 --> 46:47.966
-I'm not your brother.
-Stop. Enough.

46:48.050 --> 46:50.041
I should kill you, you son of a bitch!

46:50.140 --> 46:53.212
I should fucking kill you!
Let me fucking go!

46:53.390 --> 46:55.051
Let me fucking go!

46:55.140 --> 46:56.801
Let me fucking go!

46:56.890 --> 46:57.936
Stop.

47:01.810 --> 47:03.311
I hate you.

47:14.330 --> 47:15.945
What the fuck did you just do?

48:04.210 --> 48:08.169
You are the most
beautiful woman in this family.

49:00.680 --> 49:01.669
[engine stops]

49:05.560 --> 49:07.892
You're not gonna do anything
stupid tonight, are you?

49:09.070 --> 49:10.059
No.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.429
Promise me?

49:14.860 --> 49:15.986
I promise.

49:25.000 --> 49:25.989
[engine starts]

49:48.190 --> 49:49.179
[door opens]

49:51.530 --> 49:52.519
[door closes]

49:57.410 --> 49:58.525
Hey.

49:59.990 --> 50:01.036
Hey.

50:08.710 --> 50:12.498
You asked earlier about Hannah's case,
but I couldn't talk.

50:14.050 --> 50:17.713
The Bakers' lawyer
got a judge to fast-track the case.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.928
The school offered a settlement.
The Bakers turned it down today.

50:21.100 --> 50:23.591
Things are going to be moving quickly
from now on.

50:25.730 --> 50:27.129
To trial?

50:27.310 --> 50:31.189
Bakers' lawyer will be issuing
deposition subpoenas right away.

50:33.110 --> 50:34.737
Got a copy of his list tonight.

50:35.740 --> 50:37.947
A number of your classmates are on it.

50:42.530 --> 50:43.610
So are you.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.170
So I'll have to testify.

51:01.350 --> 51:02.886
It's really just an interview.

51:03.220 --> 51:04.596
And I'll prepare you.

51:05.770 --> 51:08.056
Coach me on what to say?

51:08.140 --> 51:09.129
No.

51:09.350 --> 51:12.012
Prepare you for what kind of questions
they'll be asking.

51:12.900 --> 51:16.939
Which will mostly have to do with
your relationship with Hannah Baker.

51:18.990 --> 51:22.403
And the more we know before the depo,
the easier it will be.

51:26.370 --> 51:27.359
Mom.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.036
I promise I'll tell you everything...

51:34.000 --> 51:35.410
but not yet.

51:36.670 --> 51:38.331
["Talking With Strangers" playing]

51:38.420 --> 51:41.719
Today I talked to a semi-stranger

51:41.800 --> 51:44.803
A girl thatI so/ta know

51:47.140 --> 51:49.267
But every encounter

51:49.350 --> 51:52.183
- At the corner grocery
-[text alert]

51:52.270 --> 51:55.262
Holds potential for
Our relationship to grow

Was total/y afraid

52:02.530 --> 52:03.940
That shed hate me

52:04.030 --> 52:05.736
Never want to see me again

52:07.490 --> 52:10.152

Was equal/y afraid

52:12.750 --> 52:14.286
That shed l/ke me

52:14.710 --> 52:17.588
Want to be my friend

52:24.260 --> 52:26.592
Am learning to love

52:34.860 --> 52:37.146
Am learning to let

52:37.230 --> 52:41.735
Myself be loved

52:42.610 --> 52:46.819
How did I miss this lesson
When I was young?

52:47.620 --> 52:52.489
How did I miss this lesson
When I was young?

52:52.920 --> 52:57.334
How did I miss this lesson
When I was young?

53:22.740 --> 53:27.154
