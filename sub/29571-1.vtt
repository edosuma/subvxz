WEBVTT

00:13.454 --> 00:16.787
(soft mysterious music)

00:23.260 --> 00:27.093
- That they are amongst
us, there is no doubt.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.600
But where have they come
from, and why are they here?

00:32.600 --> 00:34.770
These are just some of the questions

00:34.770 --> 00:38.323
we shall do our very best to answer.

00:42.430 --> 00:46.780
Welcome to another delightful episode

00:46.780 --> 00:50.906
of Stranger Than Fiction.

00:50.906 --> 00:53.803
I'm your host, Jack.

00:55.814 --> 00:57.314
Some call me strange (laughs).

00:59.681 --> 01:02.264
(upbeat music)

01:18.140 --> 01:20.170
- [Producer] And, cut to commercial.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.663
Okay, we got 10 seconds.

01:24.940 --> 01:26.733
Okay, camera one, stand by.

01:28.467 --> 01:32.190
And we're back in five, four, three, two.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.041
(upbeat music)

01:38.180 --> 01:42.640
- Tonight, we will be
exploring a curious incident

01:42.640 --> 01:45.610
that took place at a
classified high school

01:45.610 --> 01:47.690
somewhere in Asia.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.277
Exact location, confidential (laughs).

01:53.890 --> 01:58.587
Details of the incident
are, shall we say, vague.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.840
All we know for sure is,

02:02.840 --> 02:06.133
alien activity was reported in the area.

02:07.272 --> 02:09.479
(laughing)

02:09.479 --> 02:13.330
So, now it's time to get our hands

02:14.717 --> 02:18.340
a little dirty, delve into the mystery

02:18.340 --> 02:22.873
and uncover the strange,
oh I do love that word.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.803
Uncover the strange.

02:26.677 --> 02:29.594
(mysterious music)

02:46.890 --> 02:49.232
(soft music)

02:49.232 --> 02:51.982
(birds chirping)

03:04.628 --> 03:07.378
(camera zooming)

03:14.045 --> 03:16.628
(gate buzzing)

03:19.882 --> 03:23.215
(soft mysterious music)

03:42.180 --> 03:43.782
- Hi.

03:43.782 --> 03:46.210
(giggling)

03:46.210 --> 03:47.043
Okay.

03:50.443 --> 03:53.443
(upbeat rock music)

04:26.320 --> 04:27.842
- [Omar] Zack attack.

04:27.842 --> 04:28.675
- Awwww.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.260
Hi, Omar.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.500
- Nice face catch.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.333
Yeah, good one.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.970
Whoa, what's she supposed to be, a doll?

04:41.970 --> 04:45.050
- She's the Japanese
foreign exchange student.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.900
- Oh yeah, where from?

04:46.900 --> 04:47.733
- Japan.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.530
- Hey, sushi girl, what's with the outfit?

04:53.530 --> 04:55.400
- I don't think she speaks any English.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.910
- Hey, Toshiba, you speak any English?

04:58.910 --> 05:01.240
- All right, Mr. Omar, that's enough

05:01.240 --> 05:02.913
racial slurs for one evening.

05:04.060 --> 05:04.893
- What I say?

05:13.383 --> 05:14.216
(door closing)

05:14.216 --> 05:15.590
- What time should I pick you up, Honey?

05:15.590 --> 05:16.743
- When I'm finished.

05:18.174 --> 05:19.903
- Oh, all right, bye, sweetie.

05:21.642 --> 05:24.059
(soft music)

05:29.200 --> 05:30.950
- [Tammy] Let's get this over with?

05:34.204 --> 05:35.704
- Where's Stanlei?

05:40.514 --> 05:43.931
(light mysterious music)

05:48.827 --> 05:50.130
- [Stanlei] Professor Rosenkrantz.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.780
- Oh, Stanlei, come in, shut the door.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.103
Would you like some toast?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.500
- [Stanlei] No, I'm good,
what are you working on?

05:59.790 --> 06:01.073
- This is one of those questions

06:01.073 --> 06:05.150
that have eluded mankind
since the beginning of time.

06:05.150 --> 06:06.950
- Yeah, what is it?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.480
- I'm trying to work
out the formula for why

06:09.480 --> 06:12.620
buttered toast always
lands butter-side down

06:12.620 --> 06:14.233
when you drop it, watch.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.190
Now, a lesser scientist might reexamine

06:19.190 --> 06:21.810
his ideology towards gravity,

06:21.810 --> 06:23.953
or at least the law of probability.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.100
Ah, ooh.

06:30.730 --> 06:34.820
So you see, after buttering and dropping

06:34.820 --> 06:37.350
83 pieces of toast in
a row, it's likely that

06:37.350 --> 06:40.263
the results will go down,
although the number goes up.

06:42.007 --> 06:45.860
(light mysterious music)

06:45.860 --> 06:47.063
84.

06:47.930 --> 06:49.590
It's around this time we have to consider

06:49.590 --> 06:52.150
this an abnormality, a vivid sense

06:52.150 --> 06:54.860
of something deviating from the normal.

06:54.860 --> 06:57.733
- What's to say this isn't the normal?

06:57.733 --> 07:02.285
- Well, normality is based on consistency,

07:02.285 --> 07:03.640
and some people don't butter their toast,

07:03.640 --> 07:06.273
so how can we know what
the common behaviour is?

07:07.240 --> 07:10.690
- Listen, Professor,
sometimes there is no answer.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.093
That's just how things are.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.630
- Now you're taking away reason.

07:14.630 --> 07:17.200
Without reason, up is down, down is up.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.880
- Well, what do you want me to say?

07:18.880 --> 07:21.373
Drop a cat, it will
always land on its feet.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.063
- Interesting.

07:26.192 --> 07:27.290
Huh.

07:27.290 --> 07:30.640
What if, we took buttered toast and put it

07:30.640 --> 07:33.000
on a cat's back, butter side up,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.080
and then we drop the cat?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.993
Will they ever touch the ground?

07:38.180 --> 07:40.990
- Whoa, Professor, I
think you may have just

07:40.990 --> 07:42.733
defied the laws of gravity.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.210
- Yes.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.290
You don't happen to have
a cat on you, do you?

07:47.290 --> 07:48.783
- Uh, no.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.600
- That's inconvenient.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.603
- For you or me?

07:54.529 --> 07:57.130
- It can hardly be one or the other.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.160
Wait a minute, what are you doing here?

07:59.160 --> 08:02.020
Is it not Saturday today?

08:02.020 --> 08:04.130
- No, you're right, it's Saturday.

08:04.130 --> 08:05.363
I got detention.

08:06.544 --> 08:08.033
- So late, really?

08:08.940 --> 08:11.070
- Yeah, it's messed up.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.113
Why are you here?

08:13.415 --> 08:15.746
- If not here, where else would I be?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.108
- I guess.

08:17.108 --> 08:20.110
Well, I better get going.

08:20.110 --> 08:23.363
Good luck with the failing toasting.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.563
- Ugh, I have not failed.

08:27.944 --> 08:31.540
(bread squishing)

08:31.540 --> 08:35.503
Just found 85 ways that won't work.

08:38.030 --> 08:40.610
- Right, I better get going.

08:40.610 --> 08:41.996
I'm late, again.

08:43.624 --> 08:47.207
(door opening and closing)

08:49.970 --> 08:53.060
- Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all here tonight

08:53.060 --> 08:55.130
for a very special detention,

08:55.130 --> 08:59.083
personally scheduled just for you.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.103
Phones.

09:02.010 --> 09:06.170
It seems that no matter how
many times you are warned,

09:06.170 --> 09:09.533
demerited or scolded,

09:10.780 --> 09:14.890
you wanna-be rebels
continue to break the rules.

09:14.890 --> 09:18.983
Whether it's skipping class,
ignoring your teachers,

09:20.490 --> 09:22.853
not doing your homework,

09:24.880 --> 09:29.374
disregarding the dress code, or.

09:29.374 --> 09:32.280
(rock music)

09:32.280 --> 09:33.560
Being late.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.977
(rock music)

09:45.130 --> 09:49.083
Not to mention, the lack of
respect for school property.

09:58.920 --> 10:03.500
So, we've been forced to
take extreme measures.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.580
It seems that messing with
your weekend's the only thing

10:07.580 --> 10:09.903
that will get you kids to pay attention.

10:11.870 --> 10:16.730
So, as deputy head of the school,

10:16.730 --> 10:19.070
I get to spend my Saturday nights

10:19.070 --> 10:22.195
babysitting you delinquents.

10:22.195 --> 10:23.080
(sighing)

10:23.080 --> 10:24.453
- This sucks.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.663
- Yes, it does.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.320
Well maybe next time
you'll remember not to

10:31.320 --> 10:34.820
answer your phone during a history test.

10:34.820 --> 10:38.243
- Well, what was I
gonna do, not answer it?

10:39.740 --> 10:40.833
- Yes.

10:41.750 --> 10:46.750
- Well, that's just rude,
and besides, it's history.

10:46.810 --> 10:48.010
It's not going anywhere.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.099
(laughing)

10:51.940 --> 10:53.223
What's so funny?

10:57.220 --> 11:02.220
- Anyways, you get to spend
the next few hours of fun

11:03.550 --> 11:06.663
writing down these words that say.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.603
- Why can't it be a
girl, isn't that sexist?

11:28.210 --> 11:30.403
- His name is Jack.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.373
- But it could be short of Jaclyn.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.100
- Girl, boy, you write whatever you like.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.420
- Wouldn't it be more productive
for us to do our homework?

11:43.420 --> 11:44.653
- Perhaps.

11:45.570 --> 11:47.563
But you're here to be punished.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.840
Homework is for home,

11:51.840 --> 11:54.113
hence the phrase.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.240
You have wasted our teachers' time.

11:59.240 --> 12:01.423
Now I must waste your time.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.097
(laughing)

12:03.097 --> 12:04.200
- Whatever.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.423
The whole concept of
school is a waste of time.

12:12.610 --> 12:13.523
- Really?

12:14.660 --> 12:15.943
- Yeah, really.

12:17.590 --> 12:19.970
You got all these subjects,
but the one lesson

12:19.970 --> 12:22.193
you never get taught is how to learn.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.790
- You know, Stanlei,

12:28.790 --> 12:30.920
at the end of this ruler

12:31.850 --> 12:34.883
is a waste of human existence.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.850
- Which end?

12:38.850 --> 12:41.267
(soft music)

12:44.200 --> 12:45.203
- Mr. Hughes?

12:46.830 --> 12:47.763
How many lines?

12:51.070 --> 12:53.863
- Until that pile is finished.

12:56.059 --> 12:58.540
- There's like 1,000 pages there.

12:58.540 --> 13:02.083
- Well then I guess you
best get started, Mr. Omar.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.830
Unless you wanna stay here til midnight.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.017
If anybody needs me, I'll be in my office.

13:09.798 --> 13:13.299
(door opening and closing)

13:13.299 --> 13:16.716
(dramatic pulsing music)

13:23.649 --> 13:26.316
(clock ticking)

13:44.232 --> 13:46.790
- What are you doing?

13:46.790 --> 13:47.643
- Writing lines.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.430
- Leave him alone, he's just doing

13:55.430 --> 13:57.063
what he's programmed to do.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.590
- Programmed?

13:59.590 --> 14:01.920
I'm just doing what we were asked to do.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.053
- You weren't asked, you were told.

14:06.950 --> 14:09.490
- Is your name really Stanlei?

14:09.490 --> 14:12.965
- Is yours really Tammy?

14:12.965 --> 14:14.790
(laughing)

14:14.790 --> 14:16.393
- Seriously, what's so funny,

14:17.269 --> 14:19.280
and what are you wearing?

14:19.280 --> 14:20.591
- Keiko.

14:20.591 --> 14:21.424
- Uh.

14:25.138 --> 14:28.555
(dramatic pulsing music)

14:38.760 --> 14:41.420
What's that supposed to be?

14:41.420 --> 14:43.850
- It's Mr. Hughes getting
his head chopped off.

14:43.850 --> 14:44.710
- By who?

14:44.710 --> 14:45.543
- Anyone.

14:46.890 --> 14:49.340
- I think there should be more blood.

14:49.340 --> 14:50.570
- Actually, the neck seals off

14:50.570 --> 14:52.300
the flow of blood by clotting.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.810
So there wouldn't be as much as you think.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.366
- That's gross.

14:56.366 --> 14:59.620
(speaking foreign language)

14:59.620 --> 15:00.770
- How'd you know that?

15:00.770 --> 15:02.650
What are you, a nerd or something?

15:02.650 --> 15:05.023
- Depends on what your
definition of nerd is.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.203
- Someone with a Batman pencil case.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.733
- Then, yeah, I'm a nerd.

15:15.490 --> 15:18.340
- This is bullshit, I'm
missing a party tonight.

15:18.340 --> 15:22.070
- Relax, the party won't
start until midnight.

15:22.070 --> 15:24.100
- What do you know about it?

15:24.100 --> 15:26.120
- You're talking about
Farrah's beach party, right?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.200
- [Omar] Yeah, you going?

15:28.200 --> 15:30.320
- Of course I'm going.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.823
- Of course.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.200
- How you getting there, need a ride?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.350
- No, I gotta go home play
house with the family.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.030
I'll sneak out later.

15:43.030 --> 15:44.310
- You know, your mom's pretty hot.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.143
- Stepmother.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.203
And they're fake.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.860
- Still seeing that guy
from the track team?

15:53.770 --> 15:54.603
- Not anymore.

15:56.290 --> 15:57.123
- Really?

15:58.010 --> 15:59.693
So can I get a number now.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.810
- Sure, when your phone
doesn't ring, that'll be me.

16:04.810 --> 16:05.643
- Hmmm.

16:12.650 --> 16:14.220
What, what are we in kindergarten?

16:14.220 --> 16:15.480
Come on, give it back.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.830
- You wanna shot at the
title, come and get it.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.180
- Must be a joy to be your parents.

16:21.180 --> 16:22.740
- What'd you say?

16:22.740 --> 16:26.460
- Can't you find another way
to build up your self-esteem?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.760
- You here to fight his battles?

16:28.760 --> 16:32.050
- You're a walking cliche of a teen movie.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.893
Stop playing the asshole,
take another character.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.640
- You know what, you can keep it.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.760
It's no big deal, I've got like

16:38.760 --> 16:40.860
three more of the same at home.

16:40.860 --> 16:44.490
- You got four pencil
cases that are the same?

16:44.490 --> 16:46.190
- They're not exactly the
same, their collectors--

16:46.190 --> 16:47.023
- Shut up.

16:47.023 --> 16:47.856
- Shutting up.

16:50.950 --> 16:52.073
- Tough girl, eh?

16:52.999 --> 16:54.780
What happened to your arm?

16:54.780 --> 16:56.623
- Just a regular Saturday night.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.660
- Did you try to commit suicide?

17:02.690 --> 17:03.750
- Why?

17:03.750 --> 17:06.413
- Because un-being dead
isn't always being alive.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.270
- Girl's got some issues.

17:09.270 --> 17:10.700
- Nah.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.223
She's just a skinny skank.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.730
- [Stanlei] Read between the lines.

17:17.761 --> 17:19.477
- Uh, guys?

17:19.477 --> 17:21.650
(mysterious music)

17:21.650 --> 17:24.050
- You know you're messed up, right?

17:24.050 --> 17:25.430
- Do I have to say something cool first,

17:25.430 --> 17:27.099
or can I just punch you in the face now?

17:27.099 --> 17:28.576
- Guys?

17:28.576 --> 17:30.826
(rattling)

17:31.679 --> 17:34.860
(soft dramatic music)

17:34.860 --> 17:38.053
(lights shorting)

17:38.053 --> 17:41.220
(soft dramatic music)

17:55.674 --> 17:58.527
(lights shorting)

17:58.527 --> 18:01.694
(soft dramatic music)

18:15.071 --> 18:17.404
(screaming)

18:21.509 --> 18:24.259
(dramatic music)

18:33.179 --> 18:34.883
(speaking foreign language)

18:34.883 --> 18:36.033
What the hell was that?

18:37.389 --> 18:40.556
(soft dramatic music)

18:53.817 --> 18:55.453
- We're not alone.

18:55.453 --> 18:58.870
(pulsing dramatic music)

19:12.878 --> 19:15.092
(screaming)

19:15.092 --> 19:17.842
(dramatic music)

19:43.796 --> 19:46.031
(hard breathing)

19:46.031 --> 19:48.192
- What was that?

19:48.192 --> 19:50.520
- I don't know, but it wasn't human.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.040
- What do you mean it's not human?

19:52.040 --> 19:53.190
Did you see it?

19:53.190 --> 19:54.300
- Kind of.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.610
It looked

19:55.610 --> 19:56.990
demonic.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.020
- What, like a ghost?

19:59.020 --> 20:00.580
- More like a wraith.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.080
- It's not a wraith.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.130
- How would you know?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.090
- You lifted it off the table, right?

20:06.090 --> 20:07.410
You felt its weight?

20:07.410 --> 20:08.243
- Yeah.

20:08.243 --> 20:10.970
- Then it's not a wraith,
you can't lift spirits.

20:10.970 --> 20:13.110
Besides, I saw it fall to the ground.

20:13.110 --> 20:14.270
- You saw it?

20:14.270 --> 20:15.510
- What it look like?

20:15.510 --> 20:17.263
- It looked like nothing.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.090
Like the dark came alive.

20:20.090 --> 20:21.100
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.600
We need to find Mr. Hughes.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.120
- Yeah, where is he?

20:24.120 --> 20:25.070
- Probably dead.

20:25.070 --> 20:25.903
- What?

20:25.903 --> 20:28.010
- Didn't you hear him scream back there?

20:28.010 --> 20:30.110
- That doesn't necessarily mean he's dead.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.060
- Okay, look, his office is
just at the end of the hall.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.850
Maybe some of us should go
down there and check it out.

20:36.850 --> 20:38.960
- No no, bad idea, I
mean, they always split up

20:38.960 --> 20:41.580
in the horror movies
and it never ends well.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.800
- Look, let's just get
the hell out of here.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.600
- Two floors up, at least 50
yards from the school gate.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.440
I mean, statistically
speaking, the odds are,

20:48.440 --> 20:49.970
one of us wouldn't make it.

20:49.970 --> 20:52.910
- So what now, we stay here until we die?

20:52.910 --> 20:55.770
- In the worst-case scenario,
that will never be a plan.

20:55.770 --> 20:56.880
- So what do we do?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.530
- We need to get our phones.

20:58.530 --> 21:00.260
Mr. Hughes has our phones.

21:00.260 --> 21:02.540
- Yeah, okay, we get our phones

21:02.540 --> 21:04.970
and then we call the police.

21:04.970 --> 21:07.420
- Okay, so we go to his office.

21:07.420 --> 21:10.640
If he's not there, or
dead, we grab our phones

21:10.640 --> 21:11.540
and call for help.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.510
- What's that on your skateboard?

21:16.613 --> 21:19.530
(mysterious music)

21:21.217 --> 21:22.050
- Ninja.

21:23.890 --> 21:27.160
- Ninja, like, like, karate ninja?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.510
- Ninjas?

21:28.510 --> 21:30.070
From where?

21:30.070 --> 21:31.500
(speaking foreign language)

21:31.500 --> 21:32.800
- Speak English.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.760
I mean, we all here don't
know what you're saying.

21:35.760 --> 21:39.110
- Space, she said space.

21:39.110 --> 21:41.711
- Like outer space?

21:41.711 --> 21:42.960
(speaking foreign language)

21:42.960 --> 21:44.310
- You speak Japanese?

21:44.310 --> 21:47.420
- Not really, I just, I watch
a lot of anime (giggles).

21:47.420 --> 21:48.253
- Nerd.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.700
- How is that even helpful?

21:52.700 --> 21:53.913
- So, what are they?

21:55.730 --> 21:58.720
- I guess they're space,

21:58.720 --> 21:59.573
ninjas.

22:00.512 --> 22:03.220
(mysterious music)

22:03.220 --> 22:06.530
- That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

22:06.530 --> 22:09.810
- Are you saying our school's
under an alien attack

22:09.810 --> 22:11.120
from space ninjas?

22:11.120 --> 22:13.920
- Do we really have to call them that?

22:13.920 --> 22:17.670
- I mean, you don't have to,
it's just a cool reference.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.050
- It sounds like a plot
from a bad B movie.

22:21.050 --> 22:22.910
- Look, are we gonna
get our phones or not?

22:22.910 --> 22:24.000
- Yeah.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.060
- All right.

22:25.060 --> 22:27.610
- Okay, I'll go.

22:27.610 --> 22:28.660
Who's coming with me?

22:33.410 --> 22:34.510
- Maybe she should go.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.390
I mean, she's like, Japanese, right?

22:38.390 --> 22:39.800
- So?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.423
- So, um,

22:42.480 --> 22:45.123
ninjas are Japanese, right?

22:46.310 --> 22:47.860
- And and your point is?

22:47.860 --> 22:49.960
- Well, I don't know, maybe
she should talk to them.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.030
I mean, look at her, she
could be one of them.

22:52.030 --> 22:54.033
Look at how she's dressed.

22:56.091 --> 22:58.790
(speaking foreign language)

22:58.790 --> 23:00.250
What'd she say?

23:00.250 --> 23:02.233
- I, I don't recognise that word.

23:03.390 --> 23:04.223
- I'll go.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.163
- All right, the rest of you stay here.

23:08.459 --> 23:11.626
(soft dramatic music)

23:14.830 --> 23:16.690
- Do you really think
the deputy head's dead?

23:16.690 --> 23:18.140
- Mr. Hughes?

23:18.140 --> 23:19.180
I wouldn't worry about him.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.790
He's been dead a long time now.

23:20.790 --> 23:21.990
He just doesn't know it.

23:23.083 --> 23:26.250
(soft dramatic music)

23:48.420 --> 23:50.540
- Whoa, check this shit out.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.690
Mr. Hughes is a Trekkie.

23:52.690 --> 23:54.270
What a loser.

23:54.270 --> 23:55.410
- It's not Star Trek.

23:55.410 --> 23:56.533
It's Star Wars.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.953
- No no no, look, he got
the Spock pointy ears.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.820
- Yeah, but he's green.

24:02.820 --> 24:03.653
He's Yoda.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.203
- Yoda doesn't have pointy ears.

24:09.420 --> 24:12.810
- Of course he does, it
sticks out to the side.

24:12.810 --> 24:15.560
- Well if they're to the
side, then they're not pointy.

24:16.420 --> 24:17.270
- [Stanlei] What?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.510
- Okay, what would you call pointy?

24:21.684 --> 24:25.460
- You know what, I'm not
gonna argue over semantics.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.983
Let's just look for the phones.

24:33.546 --> 24:34.963
- Ah, yeee, shit.

24:35.953 --> 24:39.120
(soft dramatic music)

24:44.360 --> 24:45.760
- You found the deputy head.

24:46.645 --> 24:49.812
(soft dramatic music)

25:33.904 --> 25:37.321
(dramatic pulsing music)

25:54.785 --> 25:58.285
(blade penetrating flesh)

25:59.701 --> 26:03.534
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

26:18.259 --> 26:21.426
(soft dramatic music)

26:28.171 --> 26:30.921
(hard breathing)

26:34.239 --> 26:37.406
(soft dramatic music)

26:40.694 --> 26:43.407
(hard breathing)

26:43.407 --> 26:46.157
(dramatic music)

27:09.446 --> 27:12.196
(water dripping)

27:21.456 --> 27:24.206
(hard breathing)

27:25.405 --> 27:28.155
(dramatic music)

28:02.210 --> 28:05.127
(mysterious music)

28:30.951 --> 28:32.773
(hard breathing)

28:32.773 --> 28:34.908
(grunting)

28:34.908 --> 28:37.658
(dramatic music)

28:55.692 --> 28:59.525
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

29:04.290 --> 29:05.700
- Could you stop doing that?

29:05.700 --> 29:07.233
You're kinda freaking me out.

29:08.270 --> 29:09.330
- How are you so relaxed?

29:09.330 --> 29:11.710
You realise what's happening right now?

29:11.710 --> 29:15.270
- Yeah, some creepy
aliens are stalking us.

29:15.270 --> 29:16.860
- No, no, we're not being stalked.

29:16.860 --> 29:18.550
These things want to kill us.

29:18.550 --> 29:21.180
You heard Mr. Hughes screaming, right?

29:21.180 --> 29:22.013
- Yeah.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.313
- And, doesn't that bother you?

29:26.150 --> 29:28.720
- Mr. Hughes potentially being dead?

29:28.720 --> 29:29.553
- Yeah.

29:30.510 --> 29:31.883
- No.

29:31.883 --> 29:32.793
- Why not?

29:33.710 --> 29:36.570
- Because, he's a dick.

29:36.570 --> 29:40.003
- You, uh, uh, it's a strong argument.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.410
Okay, let me put this in
a different perspective.

29:44.410 --> 29:47.390
Right now, our school is
under attack by space ninjas,

29:47.390 --> 29:49.300
possibly even the entire
planet, and you're sitting

29:49.300 --> 29:50.680
down there, doing your nai--

29:50.680 --> 29:53.900
You, wait, did you,

29:53.900 --> 29:56.810
did you grab that while
running out of class?

29:56.810 --> 29:58.158
- Of course.

29:58.158 --> 30:00.250
Do you know how much this stuff costs?

30:00.250 --> 30:02.300
- More than your life, apparently.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.233
- This stuff has saved my life.

30:07.010 --> 30:08.970
- Really, saved your life?

30:08.970 --> 30:10.470
- More times than I can count.

30:12.861 --> 30:17.420
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

30:17.420 --> 30:18.470
Did you get my phone?

30:20.740 --> 30:22.750
- Where's, where's Omar?

30:22.750 --> 30:25.545
- I don't know, I don't think he made it.

30:25.545 --> 30:29.013
(speaking foreign language)

30:29.013 --> 30:29.950
- Did you find Mr. Hughes?

30:29.950 --> 30:32.693
- Yeah, I did, and you're right.

30:32.693 --> 30:34.993
There's not much blood from decapitation.

30:36.190 --> 30:37.940
- Oh my God, you're kidding, right?

30:39.040 --> 30:42.220
You're not kidding, we are so screwed.

30:42.220 --> 30:43.680
- It's not working.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.210
- Maybe it's the battery, let me try mine.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.693
- It's not the battery.

30:52.490 --> 30:54.518
- Mine's completely dead.

30:54.518 --> 30:58.061
(speaking foreign language)

30:58.061 --> 31:01.374
(soft dramatic music)

31:01.374 --> 31:02.207
- EMP.

31:03.268 --> 31:04.750
- What?

31:04.750 --> 31:07.770
- EMP, it's gotta be,
electromagnetic pulse.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.930
It's a burst of electromagnetic energy

31:09.930 --> 31:12.720
that shorts out all electronic equipment.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.980
Makes sense, it's why the lights are off.

31:14.980 --> 31:17.773
- Are you saying these space
assholes fried my phone?

31:18.780 --> 31:19.763
- Space ninjas.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.870
- Whatever.

31:22.870 --> 31:24.423
- If all the electric's out,

31:25.340 --> 31:27.440
that means the school gate must be locked.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.040
- So we're trapped?

31:33.142 --> 31:34.950
- We need to get help.

31:34.950 --> 31:36.420
- I think they're blind.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.730
- Huh, what are we talking
about, who's blind?

31:38.730 --> 31:40.120
- Those space nin--

31:40.120 --> 31:43.700
I mean those, those things,
I think they're blind.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.970
- They're not blind, they
were chasing us down the hall.

31:46.970 --> 31:50.047
- Yeah, but I think they can
track us through our breathing.

31:50.047 --> 31:51.460
(speaking foreign language)

31:51.460 --> 31:52.320
- What?

31:52.320 --> 31:53.420
- What makes you say that?

31:53.420 --> 31:56.354
- It came this close to me,
and when I stopped breathing,

31:56.354 --> 31:59.540
it's as if it couldn't see me.

31:59.540 --> 32:02.170
But when I exhaled, it could see me.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.400
- Could be, makes sense.

32:03.400 --> 32:04.970
- How does that make any sense?

32:04.970 --> 32:06.570
- Well think about it.

32:06.570 --> 32:08.600
Some animals are blind, hunt at night.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.190
They use different senses.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.760
Like bats.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.060
Some snakes are blind too.

32:14.210 --> 32:15.520
- Blind mice.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.270
- No, that's a nursery rhyme, you--

32:19.680 --> 32:21.430
- What about campus security?

32:21.430 --> 32:24.210
- Yeah, yeah, there's
always a guard around here.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.790
- Yuck, hope it's not the
one that smells of onions.

32:27.790 --> 32:30.040
- Yeah, because that's
what matters most now.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.000
Should we go to the guardhouse?

32:33.000 --> 32:35.240
- Wait, wait, if he's there,

32:35.240 --> 32:37.170
he could be doing his rounds.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.140
He could be anywhere in the school.

32:39.140 --> 32:41.220
- Yeah, but he's got to use the bridge.

32:41.220 --> 32:43.853
The bridge links the
guardhouse to the school block.

32:45.150 --> 32:47.310
We may meet him on his way.

32:47.310 --> 32:48.950
- Not like we got any other options.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.960
- Okay, you guys go ahead.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.560
I'll stay here.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.610
- We stick together.

32:54.610 --> 32:56.970
- Yeah, like I've been
saying from the beginning.

32:56.970 --> 33:00.100
Never split up, it's a
surefire way to get killed.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.810
I mean, look what happened to Omar.

33:01.810 --> 33:05.170
Hate to say I told you
so, but I told you so.

33:05.170 --> 33:06.810
- Okay, well, maybe he's not dead.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.640
Maybe he escaped.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.550
- Yeah, so why isn't the school swamped

33:10.550 --> 33:11.823
with police cars now?

33:12.800 --> 33:16.374
- Okay, fine, let's go to the guardhouse.

33:16.374 --> 33:20.207
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

33:40.600 --> 33:43.770
- Right, we run this
bridge as fast as we can.

33:43.770 --> 33:45.063
Don't stop for nothing.

33:46.430 --> 33:48.580
- I'm not wearing the
right shoes for this.

33:50.890 --> 33:52.783
What? I'm just saying.

33:54.870 --> 33:57.000
- Right, on three.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.513
Ready?

33:58.513 --> 34:01.470
- Wait, is it on three or after three?

34:01.470 --> 34:03.880
Specifics, it's all about specifics.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.450
- What if I smack the granny out of you?

34:05.450 --> 34:06.650
Is that specific enough?

34:08.286 --> 34:10.679
- We'll say on three then.

34:10.679 --> 34:11.820
Three.

34:11.820 --> 34:12.652
- One,

34:13.600 --> 34:15.120
two,

34:15.120 --> 34:16.239
three.

34:16.239 --> 34:19.983
(upbeat dramatic pulsing music)

34:19.983 --> 34:22.638
(hard breathing)

34:22.638 --> 34:26.638
(upbeat dramatic pulsing music)

34:28.290 --> 34:29.123
- What the?

34:29.123 --> 34:31.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.120
What's going on here?

34:33.120 --> 34:34.612
- Dude, you have no
idea what just happened.

34:34.612 --> 34:38.125
(everyone panicking)

34:38.125 --> 34:39.699
- Quiet!

34:39.699 --> 34:40.822
Now one at a time.

34:42.860 --> 34:44.179
- The school's under
attack by space ninjas.

34:44.179 --> 34:45.870
They knocked out the electric,
decapitated Mr. Hughes

34:45.870 --> 34:47.159
and also killed a student.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.889
Well, maybe, probably, probable.

34:49.889 --> 34:53.409
- I'm getting a sense that
something bad has happened,

34:53.409 --> 34:55.460
but I don't understand what he just said.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.090
- Look, we're in danger.

34:59.090 --> 34:59.923
- From what?

35:00.780 --> 35:02.848
(grunting)

35:02.848 --> 35:05.907
(grunting)

35:05.907 --> 35:08.002
- Ugh, that's not right.

35:08.002 --> 35:10.752
(dramatic music)

35:20.690 --> 35:23.419
- What do you think he's thinking?

35:23.419 --> 35:24.880
- I don't know.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.883
Probably how to dissect Tammy.

35:29.900 --> 35:31.100
- How's he know my name?

35:33.260 --> 35:34.410
- You're kidding, right?

35:34.410 --> 35:36.060
You're not that much of an idiot.

35:38.658 --> 35:39.790
- Zack.

35:39.790 --> 35:42.540
(dramatic music)

35:45.440 --> 35:46.273
- Got it.

35:48.313 --> 35:53.313
- We split, on three.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.433
- Wait, wait.

35:54.433 --> 35:56.330
Is it on three or after three?

35:56.330 --> 35:57.651
- Three!

35:57.651 --> 36:00.401
(dramatic music)

36:06.890 --> 36:07.924
- Shoot it.

36:07.924 --> 36:10.890
(gun firing)

36:10.890 --> 36:12.650
It's not even a moving target.

36:12.650 --> 36:13.793
- Not helping.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.212
- Ahhh.

36:16.212 --> 36:17.550
She, she shot me.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.303
- Ooh, sorry, here, you do it.

36:22.780 --> 36:25.170
(gun firing)

36:25.170 --> 36:26.003
- How did I miss?

36:26.003 --> 36:27.280
He's right in front of me.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.280
- See, it's harder than it looks, right?

36:30.934 --> 36:32.436
(dramatic music)

36:32.436 --> 36:34.853
(gun firing)

36:40.460 --> 36:42.877
(soft music)

36:46.950 --> 36:49.003
- What, I dated a Marine.

36:49.936 --> 36:52.524
(gun firing)

36:52.524 --> 36:55.260
(speaking foreign language)

36:55.260 --> 36:56.760
- [Zack] I can't believe you shot me.

36:56.760 --> 36:57.593
- Let me see it.

36:58.562 --> 36:59.440
- [Zack] Ahhhh, gently, gently.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.190
- It's nothing, it just grazed you.

37:02.117 --> 37:03.967
- Yeah, but you still broke the skin.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.726
(soft dramatic music)

37:09.726 --> 37:13.393
(speaking foreign language)

37:17.970 --> 37:20.960
- Sorry to break up this
romance happening here, but

37:20.960 --> 37:24.230
now that this thing's dead,
can we go to the gate?

37:24.230 --> 37:26.520
- What if there's more than one?

37:26.520 --> 37:28.650
- And we still have the
problem of opening the gate.

37:28.650 --> 37:30.663
Five tonnes, 12 feet tall.

37:31.780 --> 37:33.650
- We need to get Professor Rosenkrantz.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.270
He'll know what to do.

37:35.270 --> 37:36.690
- He's still on campus?

37:36.690 --> 37:38.570
- Yeah, in the science lab.

37:38.570 --> 37:40.123
- On a Saturday night?

37:40.970 --> 37:42.133
What a loser.

37:43.410 --> 37:45.270
- I don't think his
social life is important

37:45.270 --> 37:46.513
at this precise moment.

37:48.979 --> 37:50.379
- Is there any bullets left.

37:52.365 --> 37:55.220
(gun clicking)

37:55.220 --> 37:56.263
- No, it's empty.

37:57.614 --> 38:00.560
(gun clattering)

38:00.560 --> 38:01.393
What?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.350
- So you think there's
more of them out there?

38:04.350 --> 38:05.183
- I don't know.

38:06.730 --> 38:09.540
What's the quickest
way to the science lab?

38:09.540 --> 38:10.640
- Through the canteen.

38:11.602 --> 38:14.769
(soft dramatic music)

38:21.400 --> 38:23.530
Canteen's really creepy at night.

38:23.530 --> 38:25.943
- No scarier than the
crap they serve here.

38:27.279 --> 38:30.446
(soft dramatic music)

38:36.410 --> 38:37.440
- What are you doing?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.420
- [Tammy] What's it look like I'm doing?

38:39.420 --> 38:41.370
I'm washing all this blood off.

38:41.370 --> 38:42.650
- You have to do that now?

38:42.650 --> 38:43.900
- [Tammy] Well I'm sorry,

38:44.782 --> 38:46.423
you're not the one
covered in nipple blood.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.330
- Now what are you doing?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.767
(speaking foreign language)

38:53.767 --> 38:55.270
Oh, oh, oh.

38:55.270 --> 38:56.310
That's great.

38:56.310 --> 38:59.573
Make sure we're all nice
and clean before we die.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.573
- Come on, let's go.

39:09.292 --> 39:12.020
- Pfft, when she says
something, everybody goes.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.003
When I say something, no one gives a crap.

39:15.725 --> 39:18.892
(soft dramatic music)

39:36.300 --> 39:37.133
You going?

39:38.590 --> 39:39.850
- Uh, yeah.

39:39.850 --> 39:41.513
I'm gonna be prom queen.

39:42.452 --> 39:43.285
- Of course.

39:46.470 --> 39:48.123
Think Stanlei's got a date?

39:49.320 --> 39:52.050
- Oh my God, you can't be serious, right?

39:52.050 --> 39:54.853
I mean, you're a nerd and she's, well,

39:56.270 --> 39:59.670
like that, that will never happen.

39:59.670 --> 40:00.503
- Never?

40:01.792 --> 40:02.625
- Never.

40:03.637 --> 40:06.823
- Like on scale from one
to 10 on a never happening?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.233
- Never.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.850
- So I still got a chance?

40:13.850 --> 40:14.903
- In your dreams.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.400
- My parents always told
me to follow my dreams.

40:22.144 --> 40:25.196
(lighter clicking)

40:25.196 --> 40:28.363
(soft dramatic music)

40:34.424 --> 40:35.970
What are you doing?

40:35.970 --> 40:37.920
- [Stanlei] Trying to trigger the alarm.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.313
Might bring some attention
from the outside.

40:41.309 --> 40:42.680
- I don't think it's gonna work.

40:42.680 --> 40:45.250
Electric's out, it's all connected.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.160
- Yeah, I know.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.593
What's that poster say
about positive thinking?

40:50.123 --> 40:52.390
- Is that the one with
the cat or the tree?

40:52.390 --> 40:54.583
- Whatever, we're all screwed anyway.

40:55.682 --> 40:56.913
- Well, Tammy for sure.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.960
- [Stanlei] Why'd you say that?

40:59.960 --> 41:02.580
- In the horror movies,
the school jock dies first.

41:02.580 --> 41:05.267
Usually followed by the
annoying blonde with the big--

41:07.670 --> 41:08.623
personality.

41:10.460 --> 41:11.293
It's Tammy.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.253
- What about me?

41:14.732 --> 41:16.051
- I don't know.

41:16.051 --> 41:18.100
I haven't worked out who you are yet.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.000
- And you, when are you dying?

41:21.000 --> 41:21.900
- Oh, I won't die.

41:23.740 --> 41:25.860
The audience will connect to my character.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.370
I'm too likeable.

41:27.370 --> 41:30.537
(soft dramatic music)

41:39.656 --> 41:40.489
- What?

41:44.485 --> 41:45.600
Oh shit.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.113
Uh, guys?

41:48.590 --> 41:51.660
One of those karate space things are here.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.863
- Space ninjas, it's not that hard to say.

41:55.700 --> 42:00.514
- Very slowly, everyone
move to the stairs.

42:00.514 --> 42:03.264
(dramatic music)

42:10.701 --> 42:13.125
(whooshing)

42:13.125 --> 42:16.292
(soft dramatic music)

42:24.650 --> 42:26.970
Everyone, stop breathing, now.

43:03.266 --> 43:06.016
(chain jingling)

43:18.843 --> 43:21.010
(ringing)

43:28.672 --> 43:31.505
(chain whooshing)

43:36.223 --> 43:39.390
(soft dramatic music)

43:49.084 --> 43:51.917
(chain whooshing)

44:29.416 --> 44:31.387
(exhaling)

44:31.387 --> 44:34.137
(dramatic music)

44:37.486 --> 44:40.131
(chain whooshing)

44:40.131 --> 44:43.236
(dramatic music)

44:43.236 --> 44:46.736
(blade penetrating flesh)

44:48.320 --> 44:50.570
(gurgling)

44:55.372 --> 44:58.213
(chain whooshing)

44:58.213 --> 45:02.046
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

45:16.842 --> 45:19.070
I thought you said Tammy was next.

45:19.070 --> 45:20.210
- Doesn't make any sense.

45:20.210 --> 45:22.060
The annoying girl usually dies first.

45:22.940 --> 45:24.513
- Well, she was kinda annoying.

45:25.430 --> 45:26.770
- That's cold.

45:26.770 --> 45:28.210
- Shut up.

45:28.210 --> 45:29.720
- I can't believe you said that.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.033
- Shut up.

45:32.190 --> 45:33.890
- Am I categorised under annoying?

45:34.740 --> 45:36.370
- Definitely.

45:36.370 --> 45:37.203
- Wait, what?

45:39.307 --> 45:43.140
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

45:44.851 --> 45:46.934
(crying)

45:54.510 --> 45:55.343
You okay?

45:59.429 --> 46:00.262
- Uh, yeah.

46:01.250 --> 46:02.440
The dull girl?

46:02.440 --> 46:03.273
- Yeah.

46:07.804 --> 46:08.637
- Oh.

46:10.381 --> 46:12.048
- Come on, let's go.

46:15.476 --> 46:18.021
(sniffling)

46:18.021 --> 46:20.104
(crying)

46:25.843 --> 46:27.676
Professor Rosenkrantz?

46:28.510 --> 46:29.343
- Professor?

46:33.356 --> 46:36.425
(door closing)

46:36.425 --> 46:39.592
(soft dramatic music)

46:46.292 --> 46:47.125
(screaming)

46:47.125 --> 46:48.875
- [Rosenkrantz] What?

46:52.270 --> 46:53.670
- Professor, you okay?

46:53.670 --> 46:56.390
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

46:56.390 --> 46:58.590
- The school's under
attack by space ninjas.

47:00.290 --> 47:02.993
- Really? Is this part of your detention?

47:04.120 --> 47:04.953
- No.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.900
- Oh, well.

47:07.900 --> 47:10.150
That would explain the
power outage then, huh?

47:10.150 --> 47:11.720
Probably an EMP.

47:11.720 --> 47:12.880
- Right, that's what I said.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.670
That's what I said.

47:14.670 --> 47:16.743
- Professor, what should we do?

47:17.681 --> 47:19.410
- There's not a lot we can do.

47:19.410 --> 47:22.440
You know, the school's gates
are operated electronically,

47:22.440 --> 47:24.760
so without power we're locked in.

47:24.760 --> 47:26.910
But don't worry, I am
working on something.

47:27.980 --> 47:30.610
- Wait, how do you have power?

47:30.610 --> 47:31.990
- Oh, I have clockwork equipment.

47:31.990 --> 47:34.520
I wind it up and I can still work.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.000
- We need to get outta here.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.160
We need to get help.

47:37.160 --> 47:38.470
- I see your predicament.

47:38.470 --> 47:41.030
Trapped in a school with
space ninja assassins,

47:41.030 --> 47:43.770
it's less than ideal.

47:43.770 --> 47:45.260
- You think?

47:45.260 --> 47:47.670
Listen here, Professor Crazy,

47:47.670 --> 47:51.670
these space ninjas have
actually killed two people.

47:51.670 --> 47:54.950
- Well, three, don't forget Mr. Hughes.

47:54.950 --> 47:56.080
- Whatever.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.963
Look, if you don't help
us, we're all gonna die.

47:59.873 --> 48:02.360
(soft dramatic music)

48:02.360 --> 48:06.324
- [Stanlei] Do you think the
whole planet's under attack?

48:06.324 --> 48:08.630
- Oh, I don't think that's likely.

48:08.630 --> 48:11.690
We would have heard more
commotion, panic, noise,

48:11.690 --> 48:14.070
even in a relatively
secluded place like this,

48:14.070 --> 48:15.580
if that were the case.

48:15.580 --> 48:19.310
No, I would surmise it's a, it's a

48:19.310 --> 48:22.300
isolated attack, and we're
probably being monitored

48:22.300 --> 48:24.770
and measured, calculated.

48:24.770 --> 48:25.660
- But why?

48:25.660 --> 48:27.410
- I would theorise that
they're probably using

48:27.410 --> 48:31.000
the ancient Samurai technique
of sending a small group

48:31.000 --> 48:33.910
of Samurai soldiers into a trivial area

48:33.910 --> 48:36.990
to test us out, check our
strengths and our weaknesses,

48:36.990 --> 48:39.670
and then see how we
fare, and based on that,

48:39.670 --> 48:40.880
make a decision to--

48:40.880 --> 48:41.973
- Attack the planet.

48:43.990 --> 48:45.080
- Are you saying

48:46.060 --> 48:50.330
that the planet's fate lies with us?

48:50.330 --> 48:51.750
- That's so freaking cool.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.053
I mean, the way you
phrased it and everything.

48:55.060 --> 48:58.123
- Yeah, and you just made it
uncool by pointing it out.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.974
- Professor, you got any ideas?

49:01.974 --> 49:04.520
- What time do your parents
come to pick you up?

49:04.520 --> 49:07.423
- Ten, that's an hour and a half from now.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.270
- So we've gotta survive til then.

49:10.270 --> 49:12.240
- So what do you suggest we do?

49:12.240 --> 49:14.710
Hang out with Professor Nutjob?

49:14.710 --> 49:18.660
- No, we gotta fight, protect ourselves.

49:18.660 --> 49:20.270
- With what?

49:20.270 --> 49:21.430
- Anything.

49:21.430 --> 49:24.153
- The sports department,
they've got bats, right?

49:25.350 --> 49:27.010
- Can I borrow this?

49:27.010 --> 49:27.843
- Sure.

49:29.222 --> 49:32.300
(cat meowing)

49:32.300 --> 49:34.350
- There, you found a cat.

49:34.350 --> 49:37.680
- That's Mr. Gildenstern,
that is my childhood cat.

49:37.680 --> 49:38.703
- That's an old cat.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.693
- Oh no no no no no, I cloned it.

49:42.600 --> 49:43.950
- Wait, what?

49:43.950 --> 49:46.020
You cloned a cat?

49:46.020 --> 49:48.290
- Yeah, it's relatively easy.

49:48.290 --> 49:50.730
- The school allows you to do that?

49:50.730 --> 49:51.830
- I don't know.

49:51.830 --> 49:53.643
I never thought to ask.

49:54.550 --> 49:56.880
- How many other things have you cloned?

49:56.880 --> 49:58.210
- Oh, lots of things.

49:58.210 --> 49:59.950
One time I had a really bad cold,

49:59.950 --> 50:02.940
I cloned myself and let
him teach the class.

50:02.940 --> 50:06.390
- Holy shit, you've cloned humans?

50:06.390 --> 50:10.320
- Yes, but unfortunately they
only last about 45 minutes.

50:10.320 --> 50:12.090
- And then what happens after?

50:12.090 --> 50:14.810
- They just kinda fizzle, blow up.

50:14.810 --> 50:17.070
I haven't been able to stabilise the DNA,

50:17.070 --> 50:18.989
but I won't bore you with the details.

50:18.989 --> 50:20.170
- Too late.

50:20.170 --> 50:21.710
- That's pretty cool.

50:21.710 --> 50:23.320
- That's what Elvis said.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.690
- You cloned Elvis?

50:25.690 --> 50:27.790
- Yes, he's quite a decent fellow.

50:27.790 --> 50:29.761
And a good chess player too.

50:29.761 --> 50:32.720
- How, how did you get Elvis' DNA?

50:32.720 --> 50:34.800
- Ebay, I bought one of his jackets,

50:34.800 --> 50:36.600
and it had one of his
hair follicles on it.

50:36.600 --> 50:40.150
Actually, I bought a lot
of celebrity memorabilia.

50:40.150 --> 50:43.873
As a result, I have quite a
collection of DNA samples.

50:45.170 --> 50:48.100
- Anyway, back to trying to not get

50:48.100 --> 50:50.430
killed by space ninjas?

50:50.430 --> 50:52.210
- Sorry, I've just been caught up

50:52.210 --> 50:55.240
in all the wacky shit that's
been going on tonight.

50:55.240 --> 50:56.520
- Well, you know what they say?

50:56.520 --> 50:58.260
Wait for the third act.

50:58.260 --> 51:01.033
- Professor, they can only
see us when we breathe.

51:02.701 --> 51:06.310
- Ohhh, carbon dioxide hunters.

51:06.310 --> 51:07.620
That's fascinating.

51:07.620 --> 51:10.683
- Yeah, do you have
anything that could help us.

51:12.790 --> 51:13.653
- Actually,

51:15.863 --> 51:17.422
I think I do.

51:17.422 --> 51:20.839
(dramatic pulsing music)

51:30.563 --> 51:32.870
- What are, what are you doing?

51:32.870 --> 51:34.787
- Looking for a weapon.

51:37.050 --> 51:39.090
- That's your weapon, a can of hairspray?

51:39.090 --> 51:42.210
- Hey, if this stuff gets in your eyes,

51:42.210 --> 51:44.163
it really, really stings, okay.

51:48.346 --> 51:50.010
- What's the lip gloss for?

51:50.010 --> 51:50.843
- My lips.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.200
- Girls, we ready?

51:55.200 --> 51:56.790
Can we go now?

51:56.790 --> 51:58.070
- Connect to the theatre.

51:58.070 --> 51:59.670
Sports hall's on the other side.

52:00.840 --> 52:02.040
- Actually, she's right.

52:02.922 --> 52:03.755
- I know.

52:08.890 --> 52:12.057
(soft dramatic music)

52:35.250 --> 52:37.150
- [Zack] Theatres always creep me out.

52:39.130 --> 52:40.800
- I love the theatre.

52:40.800 --> 52:42.620
I mean, the stage is one of the few places

52:42.620 --> 52:44.220
where I feel completely at home.

52:45.210 --> 52:48.156
- You're not gonna burst
into song, are you?

52:48.156 --> 52:49.870
- What was this year's musical again?

52:49.870 --> 52:51.330
- Alice in Wonderland.

52:51.330 --> 52:52.620
I was Alice.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.220
- You were?

52:54.220 --> 52:55.603
Man, they cast that wrong.

52:56.690 --> 52:58.873
- Um, what do you mean?

53:00.360 --> 53:01.600
- Well, let's see.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.260
Alice is polite, reasonable, innocent.

53:04.260 --> 53:05.660
She's a contrast to all the weirdness

53:05.660 --> 53:07.820
she meets on her adventure.

53:07.820 --> 53:09.267
That's just not you.

53:09.267 --> 53:11.830
- I don't have to be those things.

53:11.830 --> 53:13.920
I just have to act like it.

53:13.920 --> 53:17.250
It's a portrayal of the character
experiencing Wonderland.

53:17.250 --> 53:18.570
- Wonderland?

53:18.570 --> 53:20.053
More like Death Valley.

53:21.550 --> 53:23.260
- What do you mean?

53:23.260 --> 53:25.390
- Alice in Wonderland
is really just a parable

53:25.390 --> 53:28.390
viewing the journey of what
death and dying might look like.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.480
- No, it's not.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.580
- I'll allow it, I wanna see
where you're going with this.

53:34.580 --> 53:36.880
Think about it, one
minute Alice is skipping

53:36.880 --> 53:38.170
through the field, and the next,

53:38.170 --> 53:41.420
she's falling down a rabbit
hole buried deep underground.

53:41.420 --> 53:44.430
The white rabbit with his
watch, obsessing on time,

53:44.430 --> 53:45.980
that's your Grim Reaper right there,

53:45.980 --> 53:47.313
holding its hourglass.

53:48.290 --> 53:52.000
- Uh, don't think that's
what our show's about.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.520
- Maybe not on the surface.

53:54.520 --> 53:57.220
- Never really thought of it that way.

53:57.220 --> 53:59.290
- Did you even see the show?

53:59.290 --> 54:00.123
- No.

54:01.130 --> 54:02.070
- I did.

54:02.070 --> 54:03.510
- You did?

54:03.510 --> 54:05.073
- Yeah, and it sucked.

54:07.990 --> 54:08.823
- Whatever.

54:18.741 --> 54:20.400
(grunting)

54:20.400 --> 54:22.850
(screaming)

54:22.850 --> 54:24.900
- He screams like a girl.

54:24.900 --> 54:25.733
I better go get him.

54:25.733 --> 54:26.650
- What should I do?

54:26.650 --> 54:28.703
- Go get some weapons,
I'll meet you back here.

54:30.849 --> 54:32.395
(dramatic music)

54:32.395 --> 54:35.184
(yelling)

54:35.184 --> 54:37.528
(screaming)

54:37.528 --> 54:40.278
(dramatic music)

54:43.217 --> 54:45.550
(screaming)

54:52.230 --> 54:55.250
- In case we die, I just wanna say,

54:55.250 --> 54:56.980
that was awesome.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.380
- Yeah, but he looks pissed.

55:00.720 --> 55:01.553
- Yeah.

55:02.427 --> 55:04.840
So, about the prom?

55:04.840 --> 55:05.890
- Not now.

55:05.890 --> 55:07.360
- Right, right.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.293
- Stay here.

55:09.900 --> 55:10.850
- Where would I go?

55:11.886 --> 55:15.303
(dramatic pulsing music)

55:32.040 --> 55:33.490
Shit.

55:33.490 --> 55:34.760
That was like.

55:34.760 --> 55:35.910
- Yeah I know, come on.

55:36.826 --> 55:40.659
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

55:44.259 --> 55:47.426
(soft dramatic music)

55:55.541 --> 55:58.708
(soft dramatic music)

56:33.222 --> 56:35.389
(gasping)

56:42.779 --> 56:45.529
(hard breathing)

56:52.295 --> 56:56.128
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

57:20.813 --> 57:24.646
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

57:40.920 --> 57:43.000
(gasping)

57:43.000 --> 57:46.833
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

57:49.561 --> 57:52.773
(chain whooshing)

57:52.773 --> 57:56.267
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

57:56.267 --> 57:59.100
(chain whooshing)

58:26.149 --> 58:29.092
(screaming)

58:29.092 --> 58:32.425
(upbeat dramatic music)

58:35.891 --> 58:38.847
(frog croaking)

58:38.847 --> 58:41.097
(groaning)

58:42.073 --> 58:43.363
- This really hurts.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.520
I always thought when
aliens did visit Earth

58:46.520 --> 58:49.397
they'd have more advanced,
sophisticated weapons,

58:49.397 --> 58:53.733
like laser guns, not
fricking swords and hooks.

58:54.690 --> 58:56.294
So primitive.

58:56.294 --> 58:58.023
- What do you expect, Terminator?

58:58.023 --> 59:00.593
- Kind of, more like Transformers.

59:03.130 --> 59:04.530
You were amazing back there.

59:05.890 --> 59:07.100
- Yeah right.

59:07.100 --> 59:07.970
- No really.

59:07.970 --> 59:10.450
You saved my life, thank you.

59:10.450 --> 59:11.353
- You're welcome.

59:13.733 --> 59:16.283
- You know, you're like a
Transformer, only hotter.

59:17.540 --> 59:18.523
You're a hot-obot.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.753
- Come on.

59:28.900 --> 59:30.270
- Wait.

59:30.270 --> 59:31.103
I've got it.

59:32.265 --> 59:34.203
You could be called Optimus Fine.

59:36.130 --> 59:38.380
- Okay, I think you're
losing too much blood.

59:39.230 --> 59:41.440
- [Zack] Come on, it wasn't that bad.

59:42.869 --> 59:46.036
(soft dramatic music)

01:00:06.421 --> 01:00:09.111
(rattling)

01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:12.278
(soft dramatic music)

01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:20.427
(hard breathing)

01:00:24.879 --> 01:00:27.712
(chain whooshing)

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:56.943
(gasping)

01:01:00.998 --> 01:01:03.269
(grunting)

01:01:03.269 --> 01:01:06.436
(soft dramatic music)

01:01:10.953 --> 01:01:13.203
(grunting)

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:18.214
(screaming)

01:01:18.214 --> 01:01:21.381
(soft dramatic music)

01:01:27.789 --> 01:01:30.027
(screaming)

01:01:30.027 --> 01:01:33.194
(soft dramatic music)

01:01:52.687 --> 01:01:55.437
(dramatic music)

01:02:04.948 --> 01:02:06.084
- Ohhh.

01:02:06.084 --> 01:02:08.370
(banging)

01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:09.770
That doesn't sound positive.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.723
- Stay here.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:15.884
- Stanlei, hey.

01:02:15.884 --> 01:02:17.458
- Just wait here.

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:18.291
- Stanlei.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.690
I'm gonna die next.

01:02:33.186 --> 01:02:36.353
(soft dramatic music)

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:53.430
Uhhh.

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.933
- Chill, it's just me.

01:03:57.199 --> 01:03:58.663
- Did you find Tammy?

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:02.003
- Parts of her, yeah.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.263
- That doesn't sound good.

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:13.180
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.723
- That was all that was there.

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:18.480
- Why do you get the bat?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.480
- Who do you think's got a better swing?

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:23.383
- Point taken.

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.693
- All right, let's go.

01:04:35.618 --> 01:04:38.785
(soft dramatic music)

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:55.160
(groaning)

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.760
- I'm not sure pool water's
the best thing for this.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.130
- Actually, the chlorine
helps to kill the bacteria.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.080
- Careful, with general
knowledge like that,

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.280
you're in danger of becoming a nerd.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.853
- Nah, I think that spot's taken.

01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:19.980
- How come we never talk during school?

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:22.400
- I don't know, school politics.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.630
Cool kids to the right, nerds to the left,

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.230
and everyone else in the middle.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:30.510
- Well, what about you, where are you?

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:31.343
- Me?

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.053
I don't know where I fit in.

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.290
- You know I'm in your history class?

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:40.140
- Yeah, I know.

01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:42.423
- In your science class, too.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.533
- Yeah, I know.

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:48.680
- You did talk to me once during class.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.513
- Yeah?

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.990
- I bumped into you accidentally.

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.863
- What did I say?

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.810
- I'm paraphrasing, of course, but

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:01.830
I believe it was something
to the effects of

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:04.010
the last thing I wanna do is hurt you,

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:05.593
but it's still on my list.

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.440
- I said that?

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.040
- I swear, that's what you said.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.040
- That's embarrassing.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.033
- What?

01:06:14.033 --> 01:06:16.520
No no no, don't be embarrassed.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.353
It was

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:19.810
so dramatic and

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:23.243
bad-ass, I loved it.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.033
- You did?

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.580
- Yeah, I mean,

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:28.453
it's refreshing.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.703
You're just so confident,

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.130
and I don't know.

01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:35.963
It's inspiring.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.690
- Really?

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.523
- Yeah.

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:49.613
So, did you really try to kill yourself?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.453
- I don't know, maybe.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.103
Can we talk about something else?

01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.203
- Yeah, absolutely, sure.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:03.943
So, about the prom?

01:07:07.422 --> 01:07:08.408
Stanlei?

01:07:08.408 --> 01:07:09.900
- Huh?

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.193
- I was talking about the
prom, and I was wondering.

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:15.553
- Is it raining?

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:18.851
Move.

01:07:19.812 --> 01:07:22.979
(soft dramatic music)

01:07:46.748 --> 01:07:48.163
(sniffing)

01:07:48.163 --> 01:07:49.120
I think they're

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:51.583
gone.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:56.040
- Oh, that's, I mean, cool.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.140
- What were you doing?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.260
- Nothing, I was, I was
just doing the hiding thing

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.503
back, back here.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.150
Is it hot in here?

01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:06.570
I mean, I guess that makes
sense, we've been running

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:09.270
for our lives, and the spike
in the blood temperature

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:11.333
thingy and anxiety.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.133
- Are you okay?

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:18.200
- Yeah, me, are you all right?

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.033
I'm fine.

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:23.662
- Okay.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.290
- What are you gonna do after school?

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:30.122
- What?

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.840
- What are, you know, what are
gonna do after we graduate?

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:38.133
That is, if we don't get dead before that.

01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:41.962
- You wanna talk about it now?

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.633
- Yeah, why not?

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.303
- All right, come on, follow me.

01:08:50.482 --> 01:08:54.314
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.060
- I've never been in this room before.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:17.783
- [Stanlei] This is what I wanna do.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:21.810
- You wanna stand in empty rooms?

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:22.710
- [Stanlei] Funny.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.653
- You dance?

01:09:25.930 --> 01:09:27.203
- [Stanlei] Yeah, I do.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.450
- Show me.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:31.470
- [Stanlei] No, I'm not gonna show you.

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:33.050
- Why not?

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:34.723
- It's not the right time.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.319
- It might be your last dance.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.040
But it's weird.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.160
- Weirder than the
invasion of space ninjas

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.227
on a high school?

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.792
(soft dramatic music)

01:10:05.909 --> 01:10:08.992
(upbeat dance music)

01:11:10.806 --> 01:11:11.723
- That was,

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:15.253
you were like, really good.

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:18.523
- Thanks.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:27.720
- How come you never joined
the cheerleading team

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.710
or school musical or something?

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:31.323
- I'm not much of a team player.

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:34.570
- Wait, you gotta be kidding me.

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:37.833
- I know, I'm never gonna get
anywhere with that attitude.

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:43.780
- [Zack] Is that the janitor?

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.630
- [Stanlei] What?

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.280
- Hey you!

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.628
- Hey, over here!

01:11:49.628 --> 01:11:50.461
- Up here!

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.430
What's this geriatric doing
here so late at night?

01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:58.110
- [Stanlei] Who cares, at least he's here.

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.200
Hey, here.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.376
- Hey, you, old person.

01:12:01.376 --> 01:12:03.960
(soft dramatic music)

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.853
He sees us.

01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:13.067
- That's not good.

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:18.183
- Oh, no no no, come on, not the janitor.

01:12:20.306 --> 01:12:21.833
Hey, behind you.

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:26.790
And he's waving back.

01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:27.853
- He's gonna die.

01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:30.223
- Totally.

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.060
It's a shame, but he
died doing what he loved.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.510
- He loved mopping the floor?

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.677
(soft dramatic music)

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.650
- He's coming for us.

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:48.483
- Yep.

01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:52.507
(soft dramatic music)

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:16.777
(exhaling)

01:13:16.777 --> 01:13:19.085
(screaming)

01:13:19.085 --> 01:13:22.252
(soft dramatic music)

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:32.890
- What now?

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:33.763
- I'm thinking.

01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:36.563
- Any ideas?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.830
- Only one.

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:39.980
- Oh yeah, what's that?

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:42.633
- We kick their ass.

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.392
- Seriously, that's your idea?

01:13:46.392 --> 01:13:48.090
- Yeah, why not?

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.910
- Because we'll lose.

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:50.910
- Do you lose often?

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.997
- Yes.

01:13:52.997 --> 01:13:54.680
- Then what you gotta lose?

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.170
No rain, no rainbow.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.509
- No wait, what happened to on three?

01:13:59.509 --> 01:14:02.842
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:14:05.954 --> 01:14:07.915
(yelling)

01:14:07.915 --> 01:14:11.248
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:14:22.396 --> 01:14:24.679
(grunting)

01:14:24.679 --> 01:14:28.012
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:14:38.485 --> 01:14:39.818
Ball-less, dude.

01:14:41.812 --> 01:14:45.145
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:06.500
(chain whooshing)

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500
- Excuse me.

01:15:13.414 --> 01:15:14.348
Stanlei.

01:15:14.348 --> 01:15:17.758
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:15:17.758 --> 01:15:20.330
(device humming)

01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:23.663
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:29.660
- What's the plan, Professor?

01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:32.164
- We hold our breath,
and head for the gate.

01:15:32.164 --> 01:15:34.580
- All right, so same plan
we've had for the last hour.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.590
- Yeah.

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:36.460
- Okay.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.250
- How do we get outta here?

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:39.200
- I brought back p.

01:15:40.595 --> 01:15:43.928
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.170
- Who's that?

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.923
- Just something I whipped up in the lab.

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:57.091
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:15:59.213 --> 01:16:00.046
- Is that?

01:16:00.046 --> 01:16:00.890
- Come on, let's move.

01:16:01.792 --> 01:16:05.125
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:16:24.723 --> 01:16:26.930
(grunting)

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:30.263
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:50.473
(punches landing)

01:16:50.473 --> 01:16:52.602
(grunting)

01:16:52.602 --> 01:16:55.935
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.354
- Where's the professor?

01:16:59.354 --> 01:17:01.190
- I don't know, he was right behind us.

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.023
- Come on.

01:17:03.174 --> 01:17:06.507
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:17:08.817 --> 01:17:11.067
(grunting)

01:17:18.057 --> 01:17:21.058
(hard breathing)

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:24.160
- I can't run and hold my breath anymore.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.675
I need a minute.

01:17:25.675 --> 01:17:26.508
- A minute?

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:28.180
Okay, we can do that.

01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.044
I mean, we got like 45 minutes until our

01:17:31.044 --> 01:17:34.349
ass-kicking clone dies on us, right?

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:35.880
- No, no no no no.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.300
I'm afraid much less.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:39.423
It took me a long time to find you two.

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:41.900
- So how long then?

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.673
- Maybe five, maybe 10 minutes.

01:17:47.519 --> 01:17:50.269
(dramatic music)

01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:58.750
- How do we open the gate?

01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:02.770
- With that thing on your wrist.

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:04.973
It'll open the lock and
slide the gate back.

01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:09.673
- Okay, well, parents will
show up in around 20 minutes.

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:13.680
- Doesn't matter, let's
just get outta here.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.171
- Let's go.

01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:16.333
- We can't just leave him here.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:20.060
- Well, what do you want me to do?

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:21.067
Carry him?

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.863
- Oh dear.

01:18:24.913 --> 01:18:25.996
- What is it?

01:18:29.073 --> 01:18:30.240
- Gildenstern.

01:18:31.527 --> 01:18:32.433
- The cat?

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:36.043
- I'm afraid we're out of time.

01:18:40.238 --> 01:18:42.053
Goodbye, Stanlei.

01:18:43.509 --> 01:18:45.561
(groaning)

01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:48.311
(dramatic music)

01:18:59.348 --> 01:19:02.181
(chain whooshing)

01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:21.348
(chain whooshing)

01:19:21.348 --> 01:19:24.098
(dramatic music)

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:39.340
- I think I love you.

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:42.220
- Huh?

01:19:42.220 --> 01:19:44.444
- Uh, um, good job.

01:19:44.444 --> 01:19:45.893
That's how I woulda done it.

01:19:46.759 --> 01:19:49.773
A little less splash-back
with the blood, but yeah.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:52.983
- Is the professor?

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:55.483
- Yeah.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:57.353
I'm afraid

01:19:58.378 --> 01:20:00.228
Rosenkrantz and Gildenstern are dead.

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.763
- All right, let's go.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.044
- Right.

01:20:06.044 --> 01:20:08.930
(whooshing)

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:10.835
- What's the matter?

01:20:10.835 --> 01:20:13.085
(gurgling)

01:20:18.358 --> 01:20:19.667
- I don't understand.

01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:21.810
- No no, Zack, we're nearly there.

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.493
- It's not, it's not helping.

01:20:27.383 --> 01:20:28.690
I can't die.

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:29.523
I'm

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:31.693
too likeable.

01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:36.140
- You're not that likeable.

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:41.733
- This really sucks.

01:20:43.016 --> 01:20:44.523
I was gonna ask you to prom.

01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:46.666
- I was gonna say yes.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:49.743
- Really?

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.053
That's cool.

01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.690
I finally figured out
who you are in the story.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.173
You're the unlikely hero.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.487
Give them hell.

01:21:09.487 --> 01:21:12.404
(soft piano music)

01:21:16.694 --> 01:21:18.777
(crying)

01:21:24.062 --> 01:21:26.812
(dramatic music)

01:21:42.749 --> 01:21:45.916
(soft dramatic music)

01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:50.842
(water running)

01:22:00.357 --> 01:22:03.524
(soft dramatic music)

01:22:35.903 --> 01:22:39.236
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:23:04.954 --> 01:23:07.287
(whooshing)

01:23:09.445 --> 01:23:12.112
(punch landing)

01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:17.808
(soft dramatic music)

01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:30.279
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:32.529
(groaning)

01:23:34.066 --> 01:23:37.233
(soft dramatic music)

01:23:39.891 --> 01:23:43.224
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:23:49.366 --> 01:23:51.989
(kicks landing)

01:23:51.989 --> 01:23:55.322
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:25.189
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:24:32.313 --> 01:24:34.434
(gasping)

01:24:34.434 --> 01:24:37.767
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:44.730
(blade penetrating)

01:24:53.908 --> 01:24:56.865
(ninja hitting floor)

01:24:56.865 --> 01:24:59.615
(hard breathing)

01:25:03.005 --> 01:25:06.838
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:14.917
(gate buzzing)

01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:18.750
(soft dramatic pulsing music)

01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:48.028
(crowd chattering)

01:25:52.225 --> 01:25:54.652
(radio chattering)

01:25:54.652 --> 01:25:56.152
- Copy that, over.

01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:00.703
- How many?

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.020
- Three.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:06.033
It looks, promising.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:09.270
- Well take them down to Groom Lake.

01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:12.683
Majestic 12 has been reactivated.

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.013
- Yes, sir.

01:26:16.906 --> 01:26:19.906
(helicopter flying)

01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:25.600
- [Jack] Another speculation?

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.690
An unsourced story, or maybe just one more

01:26:28.690 --> 01:26:30.960
big government coverup.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.990
On the internet, a few
video clips surfaced

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:37.070
of the infamous men in black turning up

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.320
at the anonymous school grounds.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:43.881
They were seen leaving
with mysterious items.

01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:47.730
Can't help but wonder,
what are they hiding?

01:26:47.730 --> 01:26:48.810
- Hey.

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:53.810
- From this happening, which
apparently never happened,

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:56.093
there was only one survivor.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:00.893
And where is she now?

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.363
Vanished, within 24 hours
of her last statement, poof.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.150
(laughing)

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:13.033
Gone, faster than a politician's
election-day promises.

01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:17.700
But things just don't add up.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.860
You can call it unusual, peculiar,

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.830
bizarre even, but that
doesn't mean it's not true,

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:27.023
now does it, hmm?

01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:33.550
Until next time, I'm your host, Jack.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.910
Don't call me strange.

01:27:37.245 --> 01:27:39.495
(laughing)

01:27:42.427 --> 01:27:45.760
(upbeat dramatic music)

01:29:07.589 --> 01:29:10.006
(soft music)
