00:03.060 --> 00:04.766
Previously on Rogue...

00:04.886 --> 00:06.786
- The money's gone.
- Holy shit.

00:06.788 --> 00:08.071
No, no, no!

00:08.192 --> 00:10.507
Kendra was Massoud tying up loose ends.

00:11.492 --> 00:12.656
Where next?

00:12.776 --> 00:14.511
The question is when and

00:15.360 --> 00:17.784
- where is he gonna hit us?
- Jesus.

00:18.510 --> 00:19.950
He said he was 18.

00:19.979 --> 00:23.051
We'll give you the serial
numbers of some marked bills.

00:23.655 --> 00:25.276
Talk to your friends at the Treasury,

00:25.306 --> 00:27.705
let us know when and where they show up.

00:28.519 --> 00:29.676
I didn't know.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.377
I swear I'm not into
kids, he told me he was 18.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.799
- He lied.
- Yeah.

00:33.840 --> 00:34.740
He's 20.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.167
Please stop.

00:38.653 --> 00:39.993
Don't be such a kid.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.627
Stop!

00:45.858 --> 00:47.515
You're gonna be okay.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.594
What are you doing?

00:50.865 --> 00:52.690
So you killed?

00:52.936 --> 00:54.077
You killed Cheat?

00:54.197 --> 00:55.066
Ray!

01:52.160 --> 01:53.393
Spud!

01:54.794 --> 01:56.496
What did you do?

01:56.616 --> 01:58.965
- What the fuck did you do?
- He admitted it.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.302
Cheat... I fucking lost it, man. I lost it!

02:02.336 --> 02:04.371
Connie's in the house, Ray.

02:04.405 --> 02:06.254
His nine-month-old son, Ray.

02:06.282 --> 02:08.020
What the fuck were you thinking?

02:08.139 --> 02:11.912
He had targets painted on
my kids, man, he lied to us!

02:11.946 --> 02:14.147
We said we'd talk to him.

02:15.475 --> 02:17.050
Fuck.

02:17.551 --> 02:19.586
Eth, man, you gotta help me.

02:22.061 --> 02:25.125
You gotta help me, Eth,
I've fucked up, okay?

02:26.204 --> 02:27.861
Fuck!

02:28.929 --> 02:31.031
I fucked up!

05:04.652 --> 05:06.719
Sorry, Connie, is Spud with you?

05:06.754 --> 05:08.288
Still haven't found him?

05:08.864 --> 05:09.907
No.

05:10.108 --> 05:11.681
We'll go back out and look for him.

05:11.718 --> 05:13.328
- I'll come with you.
- That's alright.

05:13.448 --> 05:16.995
- Stay here, it's fine.
- No, I'm coming with you. Give me a sec.

05:19.273 --> 05:20.727
Spud?

05:21.349 --> 05:23.407
Spud, honey?

05:25.566 --> 05:27.349
Spud?

05:33.231 --> 05:34.648
Spud?

05:35.716 --> 05:36.897
Babe?

05:36.926 --> 05:38.451
Spud?

05:40.020 --> 05:42.176
No! No!

05:42.194 --> 05:44.526
No, get off of me!

05:45.505 --> 05:48.404
- No! No!
- Connie, Connie.

06:24.168 --> 06:26.666
I just don't understand.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.336
Why would he do this?

06:29.456 --> 06:30.726
How could he do this to me?

06:30.726 --> 06:33.735
- How could he do this to me?
- It's my fault.

06:34.348 --> 06:35.912
It's nobody's fault.

06:35.943 --> 06:38.144
Connie, Spud's been in a bad way.

06:38.611 --> 06:41.108
Nobody thought he would have gone this far.

06:41.228 --> 06:43.516
He was so happy tonight.

06:43.852 --> 06:46.432
I don't get it, why?

06:46.552 --> 06:49.605
Why did... why did he do this to me?

06:53.200 --> 06:55.414
The cops are gonna want
to search his stuff.

06:56.466 --> 06:58.350
It's best we do a once over.

06:59.136 --> 07:00.533
Alright.

07:09.105 --> 07:11.045
We need Donna to alibi this.

07:11.078 --> 07:12.636
- Will she do it?
- Yeah, I'll talk to her.

07:14.246 --> 07:16.853
Do you think those Forensics
guys are gonna buy it?

07:17.151 --> 07:18.651
We'll find out soon enough.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.354
Hey.

07:25.441 --> 07:27.508
- Shit.
- This is Spud's share.

07:27.628 --> 07:29.292
Where's Cheat's?

07:29.412 --> 07:32.428
He said he didn't take
it. I thought he was lying.

07:32.840 --> 07:34.167
Fuck.

07:35.469 --> 07:37.505
It means Cheat's money's still out there.

07:56.046 --> 07:57.894
So you're the guys that took down the body?

07:58.141 --> 07:59.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.194
Why?

08:01.228 --> 08:03.511
He was a friend of ours. We
didn't like seeing him that way.

08:04.324 --> 08:06.580
You realize you've
contaminated the whole scene?

08:06.821 --> 08:10.224
Sorry, Officer, I guess we just
weren't thinking about that.

08:37.798 --> 08:39.232
What happened?

08:41.101 --> 08:43.231
- What are you talking about?
- No.

08:44.668 --> 08:47.887
Don't you fucking lie to me, Ray
Williams. I know you too well.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.244
What happened?

08:59.960 --> 09:02.422
Did you leave any evidence?

09:03.424 --> 09:05.291
Can they link this back to you?

09:05.326 --> 09:06.866
No, I'm handling it.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.095
I'm handling it.

09:10.232 --> 09:11.659
D?

09:11.677 --> 09:13.735
Listen, I had no choice, alright?

09:13.781 --> 09:15.473
He forced my...

09:17.137 --> 09:19.072
Connie is family.

09:19.106 --> 09:21.040
We broke bread with them.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.796
We stood up in church for them.

09:25.808 --> 09:28.570
You cover this up, you make it go away,

09:28.690 --> 09:30.874
so she never has to know.

09:30.994 --> 09:32.200
Do you hear me?

09:32.228 --> 09:34.002
- Yeah. I do.
- Do you hear me?

09:34.478 --> 09:37.258
Yeah, I'll take care of it, I promise.

09:47.036 --> 09:49.908
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:51.681 --> 09:54.142
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.558
Corporal Finch?

10:16.331 --> 10:18.197
Detective Grace Travis.

10:18.232 --> 10:19.824
You are a hard guy to reach.

10:19.852 --> 10:21.983
I left you a bunch of messages. Did you...

10:22.723 --> 10:25.104
For a detective, you don't take hints well.

10:26.108 --> 10:29.244
Look, I just flew nearly
two hours to be here.

10:29.364 --> 10:31.244
I just want five minutes of your time.

10:31.278 --> 10:34.422
I wanted to ask you about
er... Corporal Hicks.

10:34.449 --> 10:36.690
I believe the two of you were close.

10:40.312 --> 10:42.121
Ten years.

10:42.334 --> 10:43.642
What about him?

10:43.762 --> 10:46.697
Did he ever mention the
name Ethan Kelly to you?

10:46.999 --> 10:48.008
No.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.185
Here,

10:49.487 --> 10:50.712
this guy.

10:51.902 --> 10:55.249
He's been leaving money for
Hicks's family ever since he died.

10:55.277 --> 10:56.868
Just trying to find out why.

10:57.271 --> 10:58.571
I've no idea.

11:00.856 --> 11:02.274
Look...

11:02.640 --> 11:06.600
Whatever Hicks was mixed up
in, however illicit or illegal,

11:06.720 --> 11:08.395
guaranteed, I can be discreet.

11:08.515 --> 11:10.076
Wayne was a fucking boy scout.

11:10.121 --> 11:12.435
You wanna throw dirt on his
grave, good luck with that.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.817
We're done here.

11:16.094 --> 11:18.573
Yeah. Thanks for your time.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.797
Hey.

11:27.434 --> 11:29.961
Whatever's going on, you're
looking in the wrong place.

11:30.006 --> 11:32.138
How do you know that?

11:34.378 --> 11:36.418
'Cause I knew everything about Wayne.

11:37.927 --> 11:39.839
Chattiest motherfucker I ever met.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.284
Yeah?

11:41.979 --> 11:44.102
I can tell you his favorite soup.

11:44.222 --> 11:45.995
I can tell you his first kiss.

11:46.727 --> 11:49.946
So if I can't tell you who that
guy is, he meant nothing to Wayne.

11:52.077 --> 11:53.897
That's all I'm saying.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.269
Maybe we're looking at this all wrong.

12:03.303 --> 12:04.985
Wrong, how?

12:05.105 --> 12:08.093
No one in Hicks's squad recognized Ethan.

12:08.213 --> 12:11.376
So maybe his connection
to Hicks isn't personal.

12:11.496 --> 12:14.101
Maybe it's something to
do with the Chinook crash.

12:14.915 --> 12:16.681
Look, I'm on my way back.

12:16.801 --> 12:19.785
Can your contact at the Pentagon
get us a manifest of the flight?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.354
We can talk to the other families.

12:21.388 --> 12:23.523
I'll see what I can do.

12:34.626 --> 12:35.968
Hey, how are you?

12:36.003 --> 12:38.230
I'm at the end of a very shitty week.

12:38.907 --> 12:41.288
Fighting the urge to... drink alone.

12:41.408 --> 12:43.004
Do you want to help me out with that?

12:43.023 --> 12:44.541
What do you have in mind?

12:44.661 --> 12:46.178
Let me buy you a drink.

12:47.014 --> 12:49.800
What, like real human beings?

12:50.267 --> 12:51.529
No business?

12:51.547 --> 12:53.486
Like real human beings, no business.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.855
Think you can handle that?

12:56.724 --> 12:58.991
Mm, I don't know.

12:59.624 --> 13:02.028
Besides, I'm not back until late tonight.

13:02.062 --> 13:03.237
Well, me neither.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.331
Let's say 10:30 at the club.

13:08.085 --> 13:10.984
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

13:11.104 --> 13:12.638
Good.

13:18.008 --> 13:20.060
What did you get him messed up in?

13:20.066 --> 13:21.374
No, no!

13:21.415 --> 13:22.632
I blame you!

13:22.650 --> 13:24.936
You're responsible for this, admit it!

13:25.319 --> 13:27.920
Both of you, you pushed him too hard!

13:27.955 --> 13:30.516
Spud barely slept the last month. Why?

13:30.561 --> 13:33.250
Why? What did you get him messed up in?

13:33.278 --> 13:35.280
- Connie.
- You knew that he was fragile!

13:35.317 --> 13:37.138
- You knew it!
- Connie, Connie.

13:37.175 --> 13:39.625
- Connie.
- What was he so scared of?

13:40.010 --> 13:41.674
Letting you down.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.369
What?

13:43.879 --> 13:45.479
- Come here.
- No.

13:45.498 --> 13:47.446
It's okay, come here, come here, come here.

13:48.342 --> 13:50.009
I'm sorry.

13:50.656 --> 13:53.190
Come on, let it go.

13:55.887 --> 13:58.137
I'm so sorry.

14:01.338 --> 14:03.213
What do you mean,

14:03.333 --> 14:04.996
letting me down?

14:05.116 --> 14:08.700
Connie, he promised us after
the last time he'd let us know if

14:08.820 --> 14:12.012
he needed help again, if
things got too hard for him.

14:13.046 --> 14:16.522
I think he wanted to keep that
promise. He tried, Connie. But,

14:17.135 --> 14:18.524
you know...

14:18.644 --> 14:21.552
I guess some of us can handle coming back.

14:22.649 --> 14:24.396
some of us can't.

14:24.516 --> 14:27.268
Yeah, this wasn't all in his head, Ray.

14:27.845 --> 14:30.754
What about these people that
were coming after us, huh?

14:33.159 --> 14:34.760
Well, uh...

14:35.117 --> 14:38.501
I think that's the stress
that put him over the top.

14:39.104 --> 14:40.440
Hmm.

14:40.929 --> 14:42.813
Connie, listen to me for a second.

14:42.933 --> 14:45.765
- Hmm.
- I'm gonna handle this. Okay?

14:46.566 --> 14:48.300
So everybody can go home.

14:48.335 --> 14:50.169
I'll make it go away.

14:50.203 --> 14:52.078
Okay?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.946
Go where, hm?

14:56.906 --> 14:59.366
I have no home without Spud.

14:59.579 --> 15:01.313
Come stay with us.

15:02.082 --> 15:04.095
We'll take care of you.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.649
Alright. It's okay.

15:10.590 --> 15:12.381
Thank you for your time.

15:12.802 --> 15:16.954
That is a no for PFC Nickels.

15:19.499 --> 15:20.466
Hello?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.082
Hi, I'm looking for a Robyn Corson, please.

15:23.127 --> 15:24.736
This is she.

15:24.856 --> 15:28.568
Mrs Corson, I'm Grace
Travis from San Francisco PD.

15:28.586 --> 15:31.280
We have reason to suspect
families who lost loved ones

15:31.289 --> 15:33.179
on that Chinook crash
have been receiving...

15:33.180 --> 15:34.398
Is this about the money?

15:34.636 --> 15:37.316
- Are you the one sending it?
- No, no.

15:37.362 --> 15:39.180
Did my husband arrange this,

15:39.300 --> 15:41.741
to make sure we were okay? Did he...

15:42.025 --> 15:44.247
did he have any last messages?

15:44.367 --> 15:47.384
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't have
any access to that information.

15:47.420 --> 15:50.143
But if there's anything you
can tell us about the money,

15:50.156 --> 15:52.552
perhaps it could help us get to the truth.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.701
It started about six months ago.

15:55.961 --> 15:57.837
It just shows up in my mailbox.

15:57.871 --> 16:00.150
Plain envelope, no name, no address.

16:00.173 --> 16:03.973
I'm gonna send you a photograph of
a man called Ethan Kelly, all right?

16:05.245 --> 16:06.882
Do you recognize him?

16:07.002 --> 16:09.663
Did your husband have any
involvement with him, do you think??

16:09.783 --> 16:11.858
I've never seen him before. Who is he?

16:11.886 --> 16:13.047
No.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.343
Mrs Corson...

16:15.855 --> 16:19.944
do you know if your husband had a
connection to a Corporal Wayne Hicks?

16:20.209 --> 16:22.112
- Aside from the crash.
- Wayne? Yes,

16:22.130 --> 16:24.535
they were both Special
Operations. Does that matter?

16:25.642 --> 16:27.381
Yeah, it might.

16:27.755 --> 16:28.807
Listen,

16:28.927 --> 16:31.130
thank you very much for your time.

16:31.779 --> 16:33.490
Thank you.

16:36.572 --> 16:39.192
Right, so we know that Ethan
gave money to the families

16:39.197 --> 16:42.572
of two of the soldiers who died in
the Chinook crash, Corson and Hicks.

16:42.608 --> 16:44.456
Right now, we have no credible connection

16:44.493 --> 16:47.401
between Ethan and the dead
soldiers or the crash itself.

16:47.411 --> 16:49.560
But Corson and Hicks have a connection,

16:49.587 --> 16:51.170
which is that they were both Special Ops.

16:51.170 --> 16:53.626
Yeah, but they were never in the same unit.

16:54.481 --> 16:58.441
Okay, so, is there something in the
military, some kind of joint operation?

16:58.441 --> 17:00.865
Like, like, like us with a task force?

17:00.892 --> 17:03.335
Uh, yeah, the SMU, Special Mission Unit.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.063
But a joint operation for what?

17:05.099 --> 17:08.406
And how does that connect to
Ethan? He was never Special Ops.

17:08.721 --> 17:11.242
Ugh. I'm fucked if I know.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.968
What about the other soldiers
who died in the crash?

17:14.981 --> 17:16.708
Any of them Special Ops?

17:16.726 --> 17:18.547
Let's see who's left.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.733
No, no, no.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.921
Ah, Sergeant Gaynor,
3rd Special Forces Group.

17:26.584 --> 17:29.609
- What does PNOK mean?
- "Next of Kin".

17:30.279 --> 17:31.734
Well, he doesn't have any.

17:32.465 --> 17:34.532
So much for follow-up questions.

17:35.017 --> 17:38.072
Okay, uh, we are getting there, by inches,

17:38.099 --> 17:39.563
but we are getting there.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.207
- Yeah.
- So if there's no next of kin,

17:42.225 --> 17:44.283
the army will hold on to the
personal effects and papers.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.369
I will see if I can get our eyes on them.

17:46.489 --> 17:48.518
Maybe there's something
there that connects to Ethan.

17:49.049 --> 17:51.016
I'm seeing him later, by the way.

17:52.786 --> 17:53.913
Why?

17:54.033 --> 17:55.724
I don't know.

17:56.489 --> 17:58.533
Maybe he feels like confessing.

18:04.965 --> 18:07.303
- Look who showed his face.
- Shit.

18:08.602 --> 18:09.969
Give me a sec.

18:11.044 --> 18:12.772
Are you stalking me now, or something?

18:12.806 --> 18:13.998
I tried calling.

18:14.118 --> 18:15.845
I wanted to apologize for that night.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.843
Fine. Whatever.

18:17.878 --> 18:20.494
Listen, Evie, I'm not that guy,
I was going through some problems.

18:20.510 --> 18:22.010
Yeah, which you made my problem.

18:22.486 --> 18:23.812
It's not okay.

18:24.223 --> 18:25.631
We're done, Billy.

18:25.751 --> 18:27.186
You're too much drama.

18:28.595 --> 18:31.504
And you're just some dumb high
school bitch, what do you know?

18:32.225 --> 18:34.147
I know you're not worth my time.

18:34.267 --> 18:35.226
Clearly.

18:35.674 --> 18:37.496
Worth your mom's time.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.717
Uh, meaning?

18:39.735 --> 18:41.116
Meaning that she wants it

18:41.134 --> 18:43.521
and she was all over me at your place.

18:43.803 --> 18:45.905
She's a better kisser than you, by the way.

18:45.939 --> 18:47.706
You know what? You're pathetic, Billy.

18:47.741 --> 18:49.842
D-bag. Come on, Evie.

18:49.876 --> 18:52.028
Go ahead, Evie, ask her. I dare you.

18:54.387 --> 18:56.849
Such an idiot.

19:10.155 --> 19:11.316
I'm sorry.

19:11.436 --> 19:12.788
- Alright, girls?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:12.825 --> 19:14.078
Manage?

19:19.832 --> 19:22.355
We need to lock down the money, Ray.

19:23.207 --> 19:25.344
- How much?
- All of it.

19:25.658 --> 19:29.344
No, we... we need to use some
as cash flow for the business.

19:29.382 --> 19:31.016
There is no business.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.355
Cheat's dead, Spud's dead
and Excelsior is dead.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.444
It's over.

19:35.564 --> 19:37.474
What, I don't have a say in that?

19:38.658 --> 19:41.700
Everything we've done up to now was for
that business, so we could be our own men.

19:41.728 --> 19:44.263
Man, these weren't the kind
of men we were trying to be.

19:45.932 --> 19:49.200
Alright, if you want to ditch your
money, give me your share. I'll handle it.

19:50.003 --> 19:52.338
- How?
- Lock it up in storage.

19:52.869 --> 19:54.872
You and I will have the only two keys.

19:56.207 --> 19:57.876
Unless you don't trust me.

20:08.855 --> 20:10.712
Keep testing me, Ray.

20:28.399 --> 20:30.191
What are you doing? Where'd you get that?

20:30.192 --> 20:31.756
This is Spud's bag. Why do you have it?

20:31.876 --> 20:34.664
- Have you been snooping around?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

20:34.784 --> 20:37.308
- Where'd he get this money?
- What?

20:37.326 --> 20:38.872
Where did he get this money?

20:38.918 --> 20:40.319
Spud stole it.

20:43.757 --> 20:46.088
What are you talking about? From who?

20:46.975 --> 20:49.728
Some guys that we do
business with. Some very...

20:50.277 --> 20:52.362
dangerous guys. Spud...

20:53.158 --> 20:55.015
Spud started all of this.

20:55.135 --> 20:56.798
You're a liar.

20:56.918 --> 20:58.318
Spud wouldn't do that.

20:58.352 --> 21:00.675
No, that's why Cheat was
killed, why we were on the run,

21:00.694 --> 21:02.898
that's why Spud cracked because
he couldn't handle the shame.

21:02.907 --> 21:05.570
- I'm sorry, Connie, I'm really sorry.
- Stop it, okay?

21:06.513 --> 21:09.154
Why are you saying all of this to me?

21:09.274 --> 21:10.649
It's true, Con.

21:13.024 --> 21:15.631
I heard the boys fighting about it.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.524
They didn't want to tell you...

21:20.825 --> 21:23.715
You shouldn't have to
remember Spud this way.

21:28.868 --> 21:31.682
All he wanted was a better
life for you and Kyle.

21:39.492 --> 21:42.400
That's why you have to let the boys

21:42.520 --> 21:44.632
give the money back, Connie.

21:45.803 --> 21:48.387
So that we're all safe again.

21:50.385 --> 21:52.205
That's what Spud would want.

22:19.619 --> 22:21.392
How'd he do it?

22:21.588 --> 22:23.522
Well, he hung himself.

22:24.548 --> 22:26.558
He didn't even leave a note.

22:26.893 --> 22:30.374
I mean, even if he did, I don't
know what I'd want him to say.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.819
God, man, I'm sorry.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.102
Thanks.

22:38.907 --> 22:40.839
Are you sure it was suicide?

22:41.422 --> 22:42.291
Hm?

22:42.411 --> 22:44.541
Come on, Ethan, those guys...

22:44.661 --> 22:48.301
the ones after you for money, how
do you know they didn't kill Spud,

22:48.421 --> 22:50.331
make it look like he did it?

22:50.340 --> 22:51.712
I guess I don't.

22:54.255 --> 22:55.709
I mean...

22:57.624 --> 22:59.934
I got to be honest with
you, I'm not really sure

22:59.953 --> 23:01.919
Nina, what the hell I know anymore.

23:04.664 --> 23:06.969
You've never really talked about your boys.

23:07.847 --> 23:09.067
No.

23:09.438 --> 23:11.679
Did you and Spud go back?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.372
Yeah, yeah.

23:15.063 --> 23:16.791
Did you meet in the military?

23:19.913 --> 23:22.233
 I didn't say I was ex-military.

23:22.353 --> 23:23.669
Come on.

23:24.126 --> 23:26.275
Everything about you says "ex-military".

23:26.311 --> 23:27.656
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, and believe me,

23:27.674 --> 23:29.430
when you've dated a few of your kind,

23:30.354 --> 23:31.772
I can see you a mile off.

23:32.625 --> 23:35.274
You know, I'd have never
figured you for a tag chaser.

23:37.864 --> 23:40.199
Let's just say that I
had a youthful weakness

23:40.233 --> 23:42.501
for strong men with giant egos.

23:42.535 --> 23:44.130
Youthful, huh?

23:44.651 --> 23:46.519
You're not doing so bad.

23:47.029 --> 23:49.553
It's not a hard-and-fast rule.

23:49.943 --> 23:52.553
- I've been known to relapse.
- Oh, yeah?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.580
I'll keep that in mind.

23:55.582 --> 23:57.346
You know, in my experience,

23:57.383 --> 24:00.008
there's two kinds of guys
that come back for more.

24:00.820 --> 24:03.749
There's the ones that are
always talking about it...

24:04.757 --> 24:07.159
... and then there's
the ones that never do.

24:08.294 --> 24:10.444
Those are the ones I worry about.

24:11.164 --> 24:13.131
You don't have to worry about me, neither.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.933
No, I'm not worrying.

24:15.145 --> 24:17.267
I'm just saying that I'm a good ear

24:17.286 --> 24:18.667
if ever you need one.

24:20.573 --> 24:22.541
And I'm very hard to shock.

24:22.572 --> 24:23.843
if ever you need one.

24:27.714 --> 24:29.615
I'll keep that in mind.

24:30.657 --> 24:32.596
Good night, Ashley.

24:32.716 --> 24:34.653
- Your coat.
- Thank you.

24:37.023 --> 24:39.772
I'm glad that we did this. Thank you.

24:40.626 --> 24:41.898
For what?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.895
Well, it's exactly what I needed.

24:52.837 --> 24:54.584
Take care.

24:55.179 --> 24:56.575
Yeah.

25:01.069 --> 25:02.729
Spud is dead.

25:02.849 --> 25:03.941
When?

25:04.217 --> 25:06.868
Last night, a couple of
hours north in Podunk.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.836
Ethan says it's suicide but I don't know.

25:10.069 --> 25:12.283
- We need to make sure.
- Agreed.

25:13.159 --> 25:15.438
- What else?
- He made a pass at me.

25:17.011 --> 25:18.063
Oh.

25:19.365 --> 25:20.999
You okay?

25:21.034 --> 25:23.185
It's alright, Leni, I'm...

25:23.807 --> 25:26.442
fine. You don't have to be so by the book.

25:26.487 --> 25:27.695
I'm just disclosing.

25:27.815 --> 25:29.725
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.624
I'll get our ME on Spud.

25:45.658 --> 25:48.575
If this is a hit, we
need to know from where.

25:48.575 --> 25:51.960
And I am not trusting this
to some Barney fucking Fife.

26:18.157 --> 26:19.672
It was a good pitch.

26:19.690 --> 26:22.233
You just came in a little
hard on the landing, maybe.

26:36.376 --> 26:38.174
- You got home late.
- Yeah.

26:38.211 --> 26:40.112
- Hey, honey.
- Don't.

26:40.146 --> 26:42.013
What's the matter?

26:42.893 --> 26:44.476
Did you kiss Billy?

26:45.051 --> 26:46.251
Did I what?

26:46.285 --> 26:47.924
It's a simple question.

26:48.721 --> 26:50.722
Is that what he told you?

26:50.757 --> 26:51.830
Oh, my God!

26:51.839 --> 26:54.134
- You did?
- Evie, listen to me.

26:54.527 --> 26:57.098
- Of course I...
- What the fuck happened, Mom?

26:57.130 --> 26:58.830
Just watch it, alright?

26:58.865 --> 27:01.178
I don't know what he told
you but he's very confused.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.104
- What is wrong with you?
- And he tried but I did not...

27:04.137 --> 27:05.687
- It came out of nowhere.
- No.

27:05.687 --> 27:08.147
Apparently, you steal Grandma's
boyfriend and then what?

27:08.174 --> 27:09.519
You think you can just make out with mine?

27:09.542 --> 27:11.176
- No...
- What? You can't get any men of your own?

27:11.210 --> 27:13.213
- Listen to me...
- No wonder Dad left you.

27:13.241 --> 27:14.466
Stop it!

27:18.463 --> 27:20.859
- Hey...
- You want to smack me again?

27:20.887 --> 27:22.753
Leave me the fuck alone, Mom!

27:22.780 --> 27:25.232
Evie, let me explain, just...

27:32.348 --> 27:34.570
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Oh, no, no,

27:34.598 --> 27:36.107
don't try to pin this on me.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.393
This one's all you, baby girl.

27:38.402 --> 27:39.912
What was she talking about?

27:40.032 --> 27:42.789
That I tried to steal your boyfriend?

27:42.819 --> 27:44.658
I told her about Stephen.

27:45.344 --> 27:46.367
You remember him.

27:46.404 --> 27:48.215
Why would you... why would you do that?

27:48.242 --> 27:50.209
Trust me, I was doing you both a favor.

27:50.465 --> 27:53.309
It's not good for girls to keep
their mothers on a pedestal.

27:53.318 --> 27:56.218
Or for mothers. Better she
knows you had a wild side too.

27:56.254 --> 27:58.943
I had "a wild side"? Is
that what you call it?

27:59.158 --> 28:00.937
When you take off

28:00.937 --> 28:03.407
and leave me alone in the apartment

28:03.425 --> 28:05.593
for two weeks with some strange guy?

28:05.620 --> 28:07.587
I don't even know if you're coming back!

28:07.615 --> 28:10.950
- I was 16!
- You were no ingenue.

28:10.971 --> 28:12.536
And whose fault was that, Mother?

28:12.563 --> 28:15.362
Gracie, this is old business,
and we don't need to reopen it.

28:15.380 --> 28:17.409
But I know what happened, he told me.

28:17.443 --> 28:18.801
He told you?

28:18.921 --> 28:22.276
What, that he tried to fucking
grope me and I had to fight him off?

28:22.294 --> 28:24.599
And when you come back from God knows where

28:24.617 --> 28:26.355
and I try and tell you about it,

28:26.392 --> 28:29.391
you take his side, Mother
of the Fucking Year?

28:29.409 --> 28:30.937
Gracie, I love you. I do.

28:30.974 --> 28:34.340
But it is exhausting to be
the cause of all your problems.

28:34.779 --> 28:38.447
Nothing is ever your fault.
Why is that, Grace? Huh?

28:38.859 --> 28:40.813
It's like this thing with Evie.

28:40.843 --> 28:43.532
Don't you talk to me
about my child! Stop it!

28:43.569 --> 28:45.444
Somebody sure as hell needs to!

28:45.564 --> 28:47.859
You know, maybe I'm not
winning any parenting awards,

28:47.895 --> 28:49.844
but I've got news for you, child of mine.

28:49.876 --> 28:51.005
Neither are you.

28:51.225 --> 28:54.407
Get out of my house! I want you out of here

28:54.444 --> 28:56.419
before Evie gets back! Do you hear me?

28:56.438 --> 28:59.530
Oh, yeah, and you just
say hi to Marty, alright?

29:02.210 --> 29:03.822
There is no Marty.

29:05.525 --> 29:06.984
Okay?

29:07.761 --> 29:09.719
He threw me out.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.277
I had to borrow money for the
bus tickets just to get here.

29:15.167 --> 29:16.501
Of course.

29:17.045 --> 29:19.231
Of course there's no Marty.

29:20.406 --> 29:22.945
You didn't come here to bond with my kid.

29:23.898 --> 29:26.990
- You just came here to use us.
- That's not true.

29:27.413 --> 29:29.414
I want to be here, we're family.

29:29.448 --> 29:31.818
No, this is what family does.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.220
Oh, please... please don't
throw me out on the street.

29:35.254 --> 29:36.923
Please. Gracie, please.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.789
You know, one day I'm gonna figure out

29:41.835 --> 29:44.222
how to stop letting you hurt me.

29:57.767 --> 29:58.944
Yeah?

29:58.978 --> 30:02.670
We found a woman's foot washed
up on shore 30 miles south.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.951
Some kid was gonna bring it
in for show and fucking tell.

30:07.526 --> 30:08.834
Grace?

30:08.954 --> 30:10.361
Are you there?

30:11.422 --> 30:13.325
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

30:13.359 --> 30:15.136
Yeah, I'm here.

30:15.657 --> 30:17.809
I'll get SFPD Forensics on it.

30:17.929 --> 30:19.611
We should know if it's Sarah in a week.

30:19.639 --> 30:21.816
No, no, that's too long.

30:22.959 --> 30:25.931
Doesn't the FBI have a
mobile unit, something?

30:25.959 --> 30:27.305
Just use your pull.

30:28.547 --> 30:30.395
We could know by tonight.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.717
Okay.

32:14.413 --> 32:16.414
Tom, it's me.

32:16.449 --> 32:19.339
Evie and I, we had a horrible fight.

32:20.153 --> 32:22.353
She's not answering any of my calls.

32:22.388 --> 32:25.485
I just... you know, could
you reach out to her?

32:26.426 --> 32:28.493
I don't know if she's okay.

32:29.006 --> 32:30.368
Thanks.

32:30.570 --> 32:32.884
- Is it her?
- It's not Sarah.

32:33.378 --> 32:34.585
What?

32:34.612 --> 32:35.966
Are we sure?

32:36.195 --> 32:39.680
Yeah, we ran it through,
got a hit. Kathleen Grimaldi.

32:40.072 --> 32:42.606
36, missing since 2013.

32:42.641 --> 32:44.518
Yeah, I know that name, Grimaldi.

32:44.536 --> 32:47.600
Sarah worked a case on the
woman's husband, Alonzo Grimaldi.

32:47.637 --> 32:48.433
That's right.

32:48.460 --> 32:51.330
She was written up for conduct,
torpedoed her career for a bit.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.518
Who's her SO?

32:54.460 --> 32:59.225
Uh, Sergeant Jones, is there any way Grimaldi
could be involved with Sarah's disappearance?

32:59.258 --> 33:01.530
Nah. He died a year ago.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.128
Emphysema, I think.

33:03.162 --> 33:05.144
The worst fuckers always die free.

33:05.264 --> 33:06.972
What did you want him for?

33:06.990 --> 33:09.548
Drug trafficking. A bit of a local kingpin.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.481
You wrote Sarah up for
conduct on that case.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.613
- Did she have any involvement with Grimaldi?
- No, no,

33:13.733 --> 33:15.158
no, no, nothing like that.

33:15.195 --> 33:17.742
Look, Sarah wasn't a bad cop.

33:17.777 --> 33:20.427
Good instincts, lousy team-player.

33:20.679 --> 33:23.573
Maybe you weren't such
a fun team to play with.

33:23.966 --> 33:27.734
Sarah filed a sexual
harassment claim against you.

33:27.854 --> 33:30.213
Here. You want to tell us about that?

33:30.333 --> 33:32.445
I can tell you that's
a closed fucking file.

33:32.490 --> 33:34.795
- Yeah, I got a guy that works magic with that.
- Yeah?

33:34.827 --> 33:38.088
Does this wizard of yours tell you why
the file got closed in the first place?

33:38.098 --> 33:40.558
- I was completely cleared. You know, fuck this!
- Sergeant,

33:40.678 --> 33:43.019
we have got no dog in this.

33:43.330 --> 33:46.779
We're just trying to get a full picture
of Sarah during the Grimaldi case.

33:46.806 --> 33:48.645
Anything that you can tell us,

33:49.057 --> 33:51.876
- we would be grateful.
- Of course.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.572
Please.

33:55.953 --> 33:57.626
Alright.

33:59.977 --> 34:01.752
She was new to undercover work.

34:02.255 --> 34:04.907
Feeling her oats,
wouldn't take instruction.

34:05.591 --> 34:07.492
I wrote her up for insubordination,

34:07.526 --> 34:09.297
she countered with a harassment claim.

34:09.342 --> 34:11.446
Said I was handsy during debriefs.

34:11.830 --> 34:14.331
Bullshit!

34:14.366 --> 34:16.534
Brass saw it my way, thank God.

34:16.569 --> 34:18.303
Hostile environment.

34:18.337 --> 34:20.929
You ever tried working with a girl
with a giant chip on her shoulder?

34:20.967 --> 34:22.411
Now, that's a hostile environment.

34:22.440 --> 34:25.610
- Did any of your disputes involve Grimaldi?
- All of them.

34:25.643 --> 34:28.561
She had a real burr up
her butt for this guy.

34:28.786 --> 34:31.621
His wife disappeared halfway
through the investigation.

34:31.896 --> 34:33.952
She got obsessed trying to
prove that he killed her.

34:33.985 --> 34:35.887
- Do you think he did?
- Hell, yeah.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.621
But it was outside her purview.

34:37.742 --> 34:39.824
Could never prove it, anyway.

34:39.859 --> 34:41.192
Why not?

34:41.312 --> 34:43.328
Dropped her body in the Narrows.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.405
The Narrows?

34:47.225 --> 34:48.715
This place?

34:50.498 --> 34:52.868
You never find something
once it's dumped in there.

34:53.646 --> 34:56.373
I told Sarah a million times,
"You want someone to disappear,

34:56.408 --> 34:57.775
that's where you do it."

34:57.810 --> 34:59.453
Automatic dead end.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.740
- We have to at least consider it.
- Really?

35:04.776 --> 35:06.184
This is what we're thinking?

35:06.218 --> 35:08.316
That Sarah faked her own death,

35:08.436 --> 35:12.129
- took a powder...
- And $2 million under our fucking watch.

35:12.157 --> 35:13.825
So what, Cheat told her about the money?

35:13.859 --> 35:15.541
Look, I don't want to think
this anymore than you do,

35:15.569 --> 35:16.776
but it is not impossible.

35:16.795 --> 35:19.666
- She could have faked that scene.
- Premeditated?

35:19.867 --> 35:23.379
Not unless she killed
Cheat as part of the plan.

35:23.727 --> 35:25.785
And the hooker? See, I don't buy that.

35:25.831 --> 35:28.492
Once she made the call to you, she'd
have dumped the car and skipped town.

35:28.507 --> 35:30.441
Okay, okay, obvious problem.

35:31.577 --> 35:33.411
Let's say Sarah is alive.

35:33.445 --> 35:35.911
And yes, she stole Cheat's money.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.722
Then why isn't she spending it?

35:37.731 --> 35:39.359
I mean, she doesn't know
the bills are flagged.

35:39.479 --> 35:43.220
Her card, her accounts, they've all
been frozen since she went missing.

35:43.255 --> 35:45.607
So why isn't it showing up?

35:48.863 --> 35:50.363
Jesus!

35:51.430 --> 35:52.939
You could knock.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.232
Can you track the money outside US borders?

35:56.268 --> 35:57.468
Internationally?

35:57.503 --> 36:00.667
No, in outer space. Yes, internationally.

36:01.262 --> 36:03.183
Look, our target doesn't have a passport.

36:03.210 --> 36:05.469
We think they might've
slipped into Mexico or Canada.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.844
Not officially.

36:06.879 --> 36:09.092
I don't give a fuck
about "official", Julian.

36:09.212 --> 36:10.803
Right now, I just need "actual".

36:10.839 --> 36:12.924
- Can you do that?
- I mean,

36:13.044 --> 36:16.309
off the record, I could get some
info from foreign Treasury contacts.

36:16.336 --> 36:18.138
- Maybe.
- Great, do it.

36:18.376 --> 36:20.718
For fuck's sake, when is this over?

36:21.248 --> 36:23.096
Oh, grow a pair, Julian.

36:23.407 --> 36:25.363
It's over when I say it is.

36:36.176 --> 36:38.398
I mean, there's no way of
knowing how much she's told them.

36:39.102 --> 36:41.627
Jesus. Are you sure she's FBI?

36:42.029 --> 36:43.246
Yeah.

36:43.292 --> 36:44.549
How?

36:45.351 --> 36:46.884
Ray, Nina's a Fed.

36:47.728 --> 36:49.640
As soon as I figured that
out, all I had to do...

36:49.649 --> 36:52.119
Wait. Wait a second. When
did you figure that out?

36:52.704 --> 36:54.223
I dunno, a couple of days ago.

36:54.250 --> 36:57.360
You wait a couple of fucking days
to tell me the Feds are onto us?

36:57.396 --> 36:59.839
You fucking sit on that
while I got blood on my hands?

36:59.875 --> 37:03.058
Maybe if you could control yourself,
we wouldn't have fresh targets.

37:03.076 --> 37:05.711
- We're in this together!
- In this fucking together?

37:06.038 --> 37:07.472
Are we?

37:09.361 --> 37:11.576
We agreed to talk to him, Ray.

37:12.811 --> 37:14.412
Not kill him.

37:22.855 --> 37:24.589
They're onto us, Ray.

37:31.971 --> 37:33.782
This is the game now.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.987
What's our play?

37:58.105 --> 37:59.221
Jesus!

37:59.341 --> 38:01.526
Hey, Julian. How've you been?

38:01.560 --> 38:03.428
I've been alright.

38:03.462 --> 38:05.530
I disagree. I think you've been sloppy.

38:05.769 --> 38:08.376
- I'm sorry, we haven't met.
- Oh, we're not meeting right now.

38:08.422 --> 38:11.184
I'm talking and you ought
to fucking listen to me.

38:11.779 --> 38:14.139
Now, I understand you've
been chatting with the Feds.

38:14.259 --> 38:17.341
- Are you wired right now, Julian?
- What? No, why would I...

38:17.376 --> 38:19.233
Well, you don't mind if we check you?

38:19.233 --> 38:20.459
Ray?

38:22.663 --> 38:25.750
You know, we appreciate your help so
much we thought we'd give you a heads-up.

38:25.784 --> 38:27.254
- You're about to be fired.
- He's clean.

38:27.273 --> 38:28.986
What? Why?

38:29.021 --> 38:32.304
- You've been leaking information, Julian.
- To you guys.

38:32.806 --> 38:35.128
What kind of a bullshit threat is that?

38:35.694 --> 38:38.596
You can't burn me without
incriminating yourselves.

38:39.537 --> 38:41.851
Do you remember our associate Spud?

38:42.326 --> 38:44.936
He's no longer with us,
may he rest in peace.

38:45.399 --> 38:48.739
But it seems to me there's a hell of a
paper trail that ties you two together.

38:49.808 --> 38:51.405
Go ahead, take a look.

38:57.583 --> 38:59.784
It looks like he's been paying you off.

39:00.588 --> 39:04.922
We didn't know anything about it until we
started looking into his things after he died.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.152
Julian, it'd be a real shame

39:08.554 --> 39:10.447
if this kind of information got out

39:10.475 --> 39:12.624
and smeared both of your good names.

39:14.032 --> 39:15.999
What else do you want to know?

39:22.732 --> 39:25.042
Everything the Feds don't want us to.

39:38.271 --> 39:39.690
Yeah?

39:41.005 --> 39:42.627
Shit!

39:42.661 --> 39:44.005
Hang on.

39:44.508 --> 39:45.696
Go ahead.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.566
- Your guys paid me a visit last night.
- You okay?

39:48.600 --> 39:50.568
- Did they threaten you?
- I'm fine.

39:50.602 --> 39:53.104
They broke in but had
gloves on, so no prints.

39:53.138 --> 39:55.006
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.647
But they know about your operation,

39:56.665 --> 39:57.717
that you're tracking the money.

39:57.745 --> 39:59.088
- Shit.
- What else did they say?

39:59.089 --> 40:00.287
That I'm screwed!

40:00.315 --> 40:02.025
They're gonna make it
look like I took a payoff.

40:02.062 --> 40:03.262
I will have your back on this.

40:03.296 --> 40:05.683
That's the least of my fucking
problems! These people know where I live!

40:05.717 --> 40:06.951
Ready?

40:06.985 --> 40:08.819
Five minutes, I swear.

40:08.854 --> 40:12.623
Look, I took a leave. I'm gonna
get out of town for a little while.

40:12.658 --> 40:15.681
You need to stop these
assholes so I'm gonna help you.

40:16.093 --> 40:18.361
I've been on the phone all night
but I think I got what you asked for.

40:18.407 --> 40:20.007
You found the money?

40:20.127 --> 40:23.904
Those marked bills are showing up
in a nexus in Vancouver, Canada.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.836
It's too regular to be random.

40:25.871 --> 40:28.172
The source seems to be
the Canada Alliance bank.

40:28.207 --> 40:31.669
Your target must be exchanging
their currency there a bit at a time.

40:32.382 --> 40:34.102
In Vancouver?

40:34.222 --> 40:37.825
That's where Sarah is. Thank you.

40:37.843 --> 40:40.478
We find the bank and we
get an address for her.

40:43.715 --> 40:46.295
Yeah, driver's license, warrants.

40:46.304 --> 40:48.526
Any kind of photo IDs
you have in your system.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.609
The bank is just sending
us that list now. Grace?

40:51.630 --> 40:53.631
- Yeah.
- If you could just hang on.

40:53.665 --> 40:57.142
Okay, 18 women exchanged
US dollars in our timeline.

40:57.169 --> 41:00.628
How many of those are repeats? She'll
have done it more than once by now.

41:00.672 --> 41:02.540
Just hang on, please.

41:04.209 --> 41:05.610
Go.

41:05.644 --> 41:09.272
Okay, Sergeant Dowd, I'm gonna
give you the four most likelys.

41:09.308 --> 41:12.098
Laura Mitchell, Karen Walker,

41:12.218 --> 41:13.954
Emily Keller,

41:14.219 --> 41:17.092
and Rebecca Gish, with a G.

41:19.191 --> 41:21.903
Thank you. We'll be waiting.

41:24.582 --> 41:27.491
If it is Sarah, we're
gonna have to tell Elliot.

41:28.012 --> 41:30.427
We don't tell anyone internally

41:30.547 --> 41:32.128
until we have a plan.

41:32.649 --> 41:34.250
We let her go.

41:34.370 --> 41:35.823
We bring her back.

41:51.344 --> 41:53.190
Son of a bitch.

41:53.225 --> 41:57.691
Bridget, get us two tickets on
the next flight to Vancouver.

41:59.722 --> 42:01.405
Yeah, Sergeant Dowd.

42:01.423 --> 42:03.445
That's her, Karen Walker.

42:03.565 --> 42:06.820
Yeah, I'm gonna need you and your
people to meet us on the ground.

42:06.838 --> 42:08.806
I will brief you en route.

42:09.335 --> 42:10.972
Thank you.

42:13.789 --> 42:16.231
- Tom?
- Yeah, she's okay.

42:16.248 --> 42:18.573
I got your message, she's here with me.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.418
Thank God.

42:22.094 --> 42:23.832
She said...

42:24.256 --> 42:26.223
She said that you hit her.

42:26.685 --> 42:28.392
Yeah, I did.

42:29.328 --> 42:31.429
I slapped her.

42:33.362 --> 42:36.097
And I know you're not
waiting for a justification,

42:36.124 --> 42:37.902
and there isn't one coming.

42:38.270 --> 42:40.404
She mouthed off.

42:41.008 --> 42:42.973
I know that's no excuse.

42:43.341 --> 42:44.942
Okay.

42:44.976 --> 42:46.744
I'm glad you said that.

42:48.088 --> 42:52.186
I think you should come over here and you
should talk things through with her, okay?

42:52.187 --> 42:55.405
Yeah, of course, of course. I'll
be there tomorrow after school.

42:55.525 --> 42:57.518
No, Grace, not tomorrow, tonight.

42:57.756 --> 42:59.805
I can't, I'm heading to the airport.

43:00.106 --> 43:01.826
Well, reschedule.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.145
It doesn't work like that.

43:05.182 --> 43:06.498
Jesus Christ.

43:07.216 --> 43:08.505
Tom, you know.

43:08.505 --> 43:10.983
Look, Grace, you know what,
you're not the president, okay?

43:10.993 --> 43:12.731
You're not a heart surgeon.

43:12.777 --> 43:16.481
I mean, most of us manage to
have jobs and parent as well.

43:16.509 --> 43:18.142
- OK?
- That's not fair.

43:18.176 --> 43:20.799
OK, tell you what, you know, when
you're ready to stop using your work

43:20.836 --> 43:23.205
to hide from being a
mom, you call me, okay?

43:25.016 --> 43:26.417
Let's go.

43:27.385 --> 43:28.686
Yeah.

44:39.514 --> 44:41.234
Hello, Sarah.

44:42.258 --> 44:44.428
Looking good for a dead girl.
