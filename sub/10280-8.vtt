WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.607
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.640 --> 00:08.376
What's the appeal process?

00:08.409 --> 00:09.643
A promise:
you must give me

00:09.677 --> 00:11.745
you word that you will
never treat patients.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.681
No.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.183
Then you will fail,
Mr. Nathan.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.184
You called the M.P.s?

00:16.216 --> 00:18.119
No.
You are under arrest

00:18.152 --> 00:20.054
for unauthorized absence from
the United States Air Force.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.656
Lock me up,
and throw away the key.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.325
Eric's been a bad boy.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.627
Thanks a lot,
Abby, thank you!

00:31.699 --> 00:34.735
GALLANT:
It's Sergeant Eric Wyczenski.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.705
Whiskey, Yankee,
Charlie, Zulu

00:37.738 --> 00:41.109
Echo, November,
Sierra, Kilo, India.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.110
Wyczenski...

00:42.143 --> 00:43.177
Yeah, hold on.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.646
Do you know
his squadron number?

00:45.679 --> 00:46.814
I don't know.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.816
I'm not sure.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.584
You don't have
a central directory?

00:50.618 --> 00:52.153
Johnny's up;
pulled out his hep lock.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.721
Get Connie.
I'm off.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.489
Uh, no, no, no, I'm calling
on behalf of a family member.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.725
No, no, no.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.228
Okay, then, can you transfer me
to the confinement facility?

01:00.261 --> 01:01.529
What?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.397
They don't talk
to family members.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.665
Abby, I'm not going
to lie to them.

01:04.697 --> 01:05.799
I just want to
know where he is!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.801
MAN:
I said, stop staring!

01:07.835 --> 01:09.303
She offered her cat
a heaping teaspoon...
Get away, freako.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.139
Sine equals...
I said, get away!

01:11.139 --> 01:13.441
Uh, hello. Lieutenant Michael
Gallant, US Army Reserve.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.143
What are you doing?!

01:15.143 --> 01:16.877
Are you deaf?!
I said get away!
Just stop it!

01:16.910 --> 01:18.712
Crazy retard
won't stop staring at us.

01:18.746 --> 01:19.680
Well, he's not hurting anybody.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.714
He smells
like piss, man.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.350
Okay, this way,
come this way.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.352
Can't you keep the
mental cases locked up?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.886
Hey, hey, hey.
Hi.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.388
He's not at Great Lakes.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.290
What happened?
I kept trying to call you.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.558
I couldn't get any
cell phone signal
on the base.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.426
Shh.
It's just, it's a law.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.861
It's a rule.
It's a constant.
Sit down...

01:33.894 --> 01:35.596
But they did keep Eric there
on Thursday night.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.265
They told you that?

01:37.298 --> 01:39.200
They held Eric in the brig there
three nights ago

01:39.233 --> 01:41.169
and then transferred
him the next morning.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.270
Transferred him where?

01:42.303 --> 01:43.871
Nebraska. His base.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.239
Yeah.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.774
It might as well
be Manilla.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.210
There's like a hundred
offices on that base.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.611
GALLANT:
Is that Army or Air Force?

01:50.644 --> 01:52.580
I was desperate.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.416
I thought he could
use military lingo
or something on them.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.784
Great, thanks.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.719
Okay, so they gave me
the number

01:58.752 --> 02:00.788
to the 55th Wing
Judge Advocate's Office.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.556
I left five
voice mails there.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.192
They're closed
all weekend.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.227
Oh, did you get the name
of his attorney?

02:06.260 --> 02:08.596
I can call back.
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.763
I'm just going
to go there.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.199
I'm just
going to go there.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.933
Okay, all right,
why don't we do this.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.469
Why don't I call the travel
agent and see if we can book

02:15.503 --> 02:16.737
a mid-day flight
out for tomorrow?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.306
I'm going to go tonight.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.940
Well, then you can confirm
he's there.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.942
I've been trying to confirm
where he is

02:21.975 --> 02:23.711
for three-and-a-half days.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.480
Do you even know if there's
a flight out tonight?

02:26.514 --> 02:27.948
Yep, United.
9:30 to Omaha.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.950
My shift just started
five minutes ago.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.319
I can't dump it now.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.620
You don't have to come.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.787
You can't go by yourself.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.689
I usually do this
by myself.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.959
Hold on, let me see
if I can find Chen
to cover for me.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.528
She left five minutes ago.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.830
Do you even know how
to get on to a military base?

02:42.863 --> 02:45.433
I don't know, there must
be a visitors' center.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.734
You have to have a sponsor.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.968
I'll figure it out.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.903
You should at least take
Gallant with you.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.273
Yeah, that's exactly what
I need, a med student.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.908
Well, to us he's a med student;
to them he's an officer.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.910
I'm sure he has
better things to do.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.246
He's been on a base before

02:58.246 --> 02:59.880
like you said,
he speaks the lingo.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.249
Can you...
call me a cab please?

03:01.249 --> 03:05.986
Maybe a few
T-shirts there.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.257
just pick out anything
that doesn't look like
I slept in it.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.825
What about toiletries?
Toothbrush, toothpaste...

03:11.859 --> 03:14.328
I'll just buy that stuff
when I get out there.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.764
My socks and underwear,
in the second drawer.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.966
Just make sure you pull
them from the top.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.001
Why?
'Cause those are my
respectable underwear.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.570
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
Were they open?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.505
Yeah, just made it.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.639
What?

03:25.673 --> 03:28.442
Dry cleaner.
My uniform.

03:28.476 --> 03:29.743
Thought it might help.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.681
You don't have
to do this, Gallant.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.483
Never been to Omaha.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.918
What's that?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.521
Internal medicine exam
next week.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.922
Oh, that's great

03:41.955 --> 03:44.525
you coerced a med student
into failing his rotation.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.426
I'm on a 10:00 flight,

03:45.459 --> 03:47.295
I get in at 11:30.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.797
Just call me
on the cell phone
if you need anything.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.964
When are you
going to sleep?

03:50.998 --> 03:51.999
Just get in the cab.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.335
Thank you.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.509
I'll see you in Nebraska.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.511
Mm-hmm.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:41.048 --> 04:42.550
( sighs )

04:42.583 --> 04:45.919
Okay, Frank, what do we got?

04:45.953 --> 04:49.022
Four-F with abdominal pain,
Exam Three.

04:49.056 --> 04:52.059
JOHNNY:
One, two, four, five,
ten, 11

04:52.092 --> 04:54.562
22, 44, 55, 110 equals 284.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.931
Jacob gave Esau 220 goats,
and 220 sheep...

04:57.965 --> 04:59.633
Come on, Johnny.

04:59.667 --> 05:04.938
Let's see if we can
get you something to eat.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.193
Come on, foot.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.495
Come on, come on.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.664
CARTER:
You're saying delayed

06:36.697 --> 06:38.599
but you mean
canceled, right?

06:38.632 --> 06:40.901
Well, how long
does that usually take?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.135
Go ahead.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.871
Can you give me
any kind of estimate?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.172
Go ahead, I got it.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.107
No, I could be here a while.
Go ahead.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.745
Uh-huh. Have they even started
to plow the runways yet?

06:51.779 --> 06:55.616
JOHNNY:
...must be all.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.918
The sum of all the numbers
should equal the sum

06:57.951 --> 07:00.053
of each of the columns
in each of the rows.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.790
That's part of the magic...
must be equal, must be all.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.191
Sum of the major diagonals

07:04.224 --> 07:06.527
should be equal to
each row and each column.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.895
Uh, that's a little
more tricky

07:07.928 --> 07:09.162
but it can be done

07:09.196 --> 07:11.131
if you know the secret
of the magic.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.201
The sum of any two numbers
geometrically equidistant
from the center...

07:14.234 --> 07:15.903
You okay?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.806
Yeah, it's just worse
when I wake up.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.041
At least you
got some sleep.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.010
Did it just stop snowing?

07:23.043 --> 07:25.946
Yeah, but don't expect
to go anywhere.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.148
I have another
12 hours anyway.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.117
At least they'll
be quiet.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.053
( phone ringing )

07:33.086 --> 07:34.087
Hello?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.088
John.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.089
Hey. Hang on.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.190
( spits )

07:37.224 --> 07:38.826
Hey, where are you?

07:38.859 --> 07:42.062
Uh, looking for Eric's
commanding officer.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.831
You get on the base?

07:43.864 --> 07:46.033
Yeah, you were right.
Gallant's a fast talker.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.169
I'm looking at one of those
Stealth plane things right now.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.104
Did you, uh, see the news?

07:51.138 --> 07:54.241
What?

07:54.274 --> 07:55.743
No, what happened?

07:55.776 --> 07:58.011
Three feet of snow,
dumped in seven hours.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.280
Carter, I can't hear you.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.882
Three feet of snow

08:01.915 --> 08:04.017
dumped in seven hours
last night.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.553
The airport's closed.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.254
I'm at work.
I can't get my car

08:07.287 --> 08:09.222
out of the
parking garage.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.257
The El shut down.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.725
The El!

08:11.759 --> 08:12.960
Forget it!

08:12.993 --> 08:14.294
Is he there?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.197
Eric... is he there?!

08:17.230 --> 08:18.832
Uh, I-I-I don't know.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.702
Nobody seems to know
anything actually.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.136
And I thought the military

08:23.170 --> 08:24.872
was supposed to excel
at communication.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.941
Hey.

08:27.975 --> 08:31.144
Everything all right?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.212
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.147
No, no, not you.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.982
What?!
MAN:
Off the phone!

08:36.015 --> 08:37.183
You're a civilian
in a restricted area.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.852
Get off the phone!

08:38.885 --> 08:39.953
Carter, I'm going
to have to call you back.

08:39.986 --> 08:40.888
Tell her
to get off the phone.

08:40.921 --> 08:41.655
Abby, get off the phone.

08:41.688 --> 08:42.990
Talk to you later.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.592
Uh, sir, your office issued
a visitor's pass

08:44.625 --> 08:46.226
and suggested we look for you
in Hangar 12.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.228
We didn't mean...
That, Lieutenant,
is Hangar 13.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.898
Oh.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.298
Oh, what?!

08:51.331 --> 08:53.100
Oh, sir.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.302
Sir.
You're
Wyczenski's sister?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.236
Yes.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.137
Funny guy.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.772
Popular, too.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.608
Unfortunately, he didn't feel
much responsibility

09:00.608 --> 09:01.975
to this squadron
or the Air Force.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.276
Is he here?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.979
Because nobody is
telling us anything.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.215
Ma'am, I just came off
a 72-hour, live-fire exercise

09:08.248 --> 09:10.050
short one air traffic
controller.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.085
But if Sergeant
Wyczenski was apprehended

09:12.119 --> 09:14.254
Wait a minute, aren't you
his commanding officer?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.890
If he was...
You don't know
if he was arrested?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.226
...picked up in Chicago,
he'd be brought here.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.128
Go to your hotel; leave your
number with my office.

09:21.161 --> 09:24.331
My brother is suffering
from a psychiatric disorder.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.734
I'm well aware of the near-miss
depression, ma'am.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.135
No! Bipolar disease.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.369
Manic depression.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.371
He needs to see
a psychiatrist.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.741
He needs to be evaluated
and medicated now.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.242
So wherever he is

09:35.275 --> 09:38.646
wherever you seem to have
lost him, he needs help.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.816
Did you hear that?
We're closed.

09:42.850 --> 09:45.352
City offices.
Read the sign.
We're county.

09:45.385 --> 09:48.155
I see they haven't plowed
the bay yet.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.091
No, they're having some trouble
getting them on the road.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.894
Chuny, Lydia wants to know
since you're stuck here anyway

09:53.927 --> 09:55.128
if you'll take her shift.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.830
Tell her to break out
the shovel.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.832
Hey, repeat troponin's
negative on five.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.868
Send him home with a sled
and some huskies.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.002
It is so quiet.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.370
I know, kind
of freaky, huh?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.673
So you're trying to
rent a snowmobile?

10:05.706 --> 10:06.840
Considering.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.709
Do they deliver?

10:08.742 --> 10:10.678
I don't know.
I can't even get them
to answer the phone.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.312
Okay, rack is empty.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.682
Triage is clear, and labs are
pending on my only two patients.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.817
Good.
So what do I do now?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.752
I don't know.
Go play in the snow.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.087
Hey... Ella.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.991
Oh, please tell me
daycare is open.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.959
Uh, there's a kindergarten
teacher in Exam Four.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.661
My nanny couldn't get
out of her front door

10:27.695 --> 10:28.762
the snow was so high.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.963
That's
what windows are for.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.198
Look, I'm soaked
to my knees.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.399
All we did was walk
from the El.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.234
The El is open?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.006
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.307
We're outside.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.009
On an Air Force Base.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.344
What, do you need
clearance to smoke, too?

10:44.377 --> 10:46.446
You can't talk
on a cell phone.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.314
You can't smoke.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.016
You see that truck?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.851
Yeah.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.352
It's jet fuel.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.954
Amy Lockhart?

10:53.987 --> 10:54.822
Abby.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.256
Lieutenant Ottenson.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.125
I'm your brother's
detailed counsel.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.793
Um, has he been charged
with something?

10:59.827 --> 11:01.028
No, not officially.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.830
Is he acting combative,
or argumentative?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.164
I don't know.
Or delusional.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.432
I haven't seen him yet.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.967
I just got the jacket
this morning.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.201
Okay, can I go in there?

11:08.235 --> 11:09.770
'Cause I really need
to talk to him.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.338
He's not here.
The Judge Advocate...

11:11.371 --> 11:12.740
Just wait a minute!

11:12.740 --> 11:14.374
Wait. His C.O. said
that they took him

11:14.407 --> 11:16.243
to confinement
Friday afternoon.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.279
And transferred to base
hospital Saturday morning.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.756
Oh!

11:28.789 --> 11:30.323
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.391
I'm-I'm sorry.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.393
I thought you were Malik.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.095
Do I look like Malik?

11:35.128 --> 11:37.364
Sorry, man, you ain't
that good-looking.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.365
Ooh, what are you doing?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.933
You told me to play in the snow.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.435
You can't let him out-flank you
like that.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.337
Yeah, right.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.907
Commuting on skis.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.908
What?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.409
Skiing to work.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.811
Yeah, I don't live far.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.945
Nice coat.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.113
Goodwill box.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.247
Hey, did you find him?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.783
Who?
Abby's brother.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.484
Oh, I'm just going
to try and catch a train

11:57.517 --> 11:59.319
to Midway
and wait for it to open up.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.187
Where are you going?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.454
Nebraska.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.290
She's already there.
She left last night.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.125
You didn't go with her?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.126
I had a shift.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.127
Oh.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.295
I sent Gallant with her.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.029
Gallant?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.831
Yeah. Why?

12:10.864 --> 12:12.933
LEWIS:
Carter, we've got
multiples coming in.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.201
Luka's here.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.403
Three criticals:
one adult, two kids.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.338
Some drunk plowed
through a family

12:18.371 --> 12:20.908
making a snowman
in their front yard.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.075
Where's Weaver?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.877
She can't get
her car out.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.478
The El's running.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.980
And it's hard walking
through the snow with a cane.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.049
She's disabled,
remember?

12:29.082 --> 12:32.419
( muttering ):
I thought we were closed
to ambulance traffic.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.888
How is anybody
going to get in here anyways?

12:34.922 --> 12:35.823
We'll be doing
a hot unload.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.357
Stay with me.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.959
Always approach
the helicopter
from the front.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.493
It'll be windy
as hell up there

12:40.527 --> 12:42.462
so if anything blows away,
don't chase after it.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.531
It's far too easy to
become disoriented.

12:44.564 --> 12:45.498
Right.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.266
You need some help?

12:46.299 --> 12:47.467
I got it.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.903
Your stethoscope
will be useless.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.439
So will your ears
for that matter.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.441
Rely on your
other senses.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.343
Look for chest excursion

12:56.376 --> 12:58.511
feel the pulses,
study the monitor.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.480
Pulse ox, E.C.G.,
dyna-map--

13:00.513 --> 13:03.316
they'll tell you all
you need to know

13:03.350 --> 13:05.185
about the clinical status.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.121
Don't even try to take
a history until...

13:08.155 --> 13:12.092
You have a tremor
on the left.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.427
That's the Sinemet--
it works faster when I chew it.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.163
I've only ever noticed
it on the right.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.998
Have you had symptoms
on the left before?

13:18.031 --> 13:19.599
Oh, stress, you know.
Sleep deprivation.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.402
Or a progression
of your disease.

13:22.435 --> 13:26.539
My rotation's almost over.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.541
Why do you do
this to yourself?

13:28.575 --> 13:32.012
Working these insane
hours at the hospital
when you should...

13:32.045 --> 13:33.914
Please don't treat me
like I'm dying, okay?

13:33.947 --> 13:36.583
Can we just go
get this patient?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.419
Keep your head down!

13:39.452 --> 13:41.889
Stick with me, and stay clear
of the tail rotor!

13:46.626 --> 13:48.962
Looks like they gave him
a drug called Depacot.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.263
Depakote.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.565
And Zypre...
Zyprexa.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.434
So apparently he's coherent.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.371
He's scheduled to go up against
a Rule 706 Sanity Board at 1200.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.439
Up against?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.407
It's just a formality.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.909
If he was psychotic...

14:01.909 --> 14:03.610
Manic...
actually is the term, manic.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.013
Then they won't take him
to court-martial.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.647
They'll process him
on a medical discharge.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.083
How long will
they hold him here for?

14:10.117 --> 14:13.286
If he's mentally stable,
they'll probably release
him immediately.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.355
So no one calls me
to get a family history

14:15.388 --> 14:17.224
or gives me any time to
set up treatment for him?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.225
You're just going
to boot him out?

14:18.258 --> 14:19.993
If he'd asked for family

14:20.027 --> 14:21.594
I'm sure that someone
would've contacted you.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.964
You can't count on him.
He's not thinking clearly.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.933
Abby.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.170
Hi.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.040
Hi.

14:33.073 --> 14:37.945
The doctor is in with him now.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.949
Get a name?
The mother screamed
for Toby and Matt.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.583
I don't know
which is who.
Toby. The other one's Matt.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.185
Cushing response

14:45.218 --> 14:46.553
vital sign negative.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.156
Pupils blown
seven millimeters

14:49.189 --> 14:51.691
bilaterally
non-reactive.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.361
No corneal or gag reflex.
His brain is mush.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.363
Tell me the drunk driver
died on impact.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.397
It was one
of those monster trucks.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.265
He was out
four-wheeling.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.432
He hit the whole family?

14:59.466 --> 15:00.567
Dad was inside
getting a carrot

15:00.600 --> 15:01.301
for the snowman's
nose.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.702
CT's ready.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.671
Okay. Uh, scan the belly
along with the head.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.606
I need to get to
the other one.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.608
You thinking
epidural hematoma?
If we're lucky.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.610
KOVAK:
Pressure's down to 90,
set me up for a central line.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.578
Pulse ox
is only 85.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.512
Is that the mother?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.414
Yeah, c-spine
is clear.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.483
Jumped in front of
her kids; truck hit
her straight on.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.650
Does your belly
hurt, ma'am?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.186
( whispers ):
The chest.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.354
Flail segment,
32 French.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.524
Please... oh, my boys...

15:24.557 --> 15:25.558
Please

15:25.592 --> 15:27.727
save my boys.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.629
Full trauma panel.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.730
Type and cross
for four

15:30.763 --> 15:32.199
portable chest
and pelvis.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.167
All right, another unit
on the second line.

15:34.201 --> 15:35.368
Let's set it
for a femoral.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.603
Do we have blood yet?

15:36.636 --> 15:38.005
We better, he's got
massive contusions

15:38.005 --> 15:39.272
and crepitus
over the left chest.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.340
They left my mom.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.308
No, they didn't.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.742
They left her in the snow.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.711
Hey, Matt, follow this light
with your eyes for me.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.213
She's here; we're
helping her.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.214
Where's Toby?

15:47.247 --> 15:48.081
He's here, too.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.582
( gulping )

15:49.616 --> 15:52.052
Decreased on both sides,
bilateral thoracostomy.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.453
All right,
ten blade.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.655
Pressure's holding,
but he's tachy.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.224
All his ribs
are shattered.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.591
He should be dead.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.460
He would be if his
mother hadn't jumped

16:00.493 --> 16:01.561
in front of him.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.264
Have you talked
to him?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.367
Just briefly on
the phone.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.040
( sighs )

16:13.073 --> 16:17.310
It's happening...
Mom.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.048
It's happening
to him.

16:22.782 --> 16:26.119
He showed up in Chicago
with this girl...

16:26.153 --> 16:29.056
he had just met,
and I knew he didn't

16:29.056 --> 16:32.625
have that much leave,
but I, mostly I just...

16:32.659 --> 16:34.261
I saw it.

16:34.294 --> 16:39.532
I just felt it...
right away.

16:39.566 --> 16:44.637
I should've called you,
I'm sorry, but...

16:44.671 --> 16:46.173
I didn't know
what to do

16:46.206 --> 16:48.575
and then the MP's came
and they arrested him.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.577
Actually, I...
I got him arrested.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.811
Abby, don't start.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.613
This is not your fault.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.648
No, no, I, I,
I needed to know.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.150
I had to know

16:57.184 --> 17:00.087
so I called here
and I got his medical records

17:00.087 --> 17:03.490
and they had misdiagnosed
a depression in May.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.092
They thought
it was stress

17:05.092 --> 17:07.327
which is why he was
transferred here.

17:07.359 --> 17:11.631
We thought it
was situational.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.239
What?

17:19.271 --> 17:22.742
I made him see
Dr. McMangus.

17:22.775 --> 17:27.247
You knew about
his depression?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.282
McMangus is a mood
disorder specialist.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.750
Even he thought
it was PTSD.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.751
PTSD?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.820
Mom, you're bipolar.

17:33.853 --> 17:37.390
Insomnia, loss of appetite,
inability to concentrate.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.392
It was all specific
to the event

17:39.426 --> 17:41.694
and resolved
without medication.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.631
Do you even know
anything about
your disease?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.766
Yes, Abby,
I know a lot about it.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.501
Why didn't you
just tell me?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.237
I wanted to
protect you.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.238
Protect me?

17:51.271 --> 17:52.772
What about protecting him?

17:52.805 --> 17:55.708
Your brother didn't
want you to know.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.312
Can't get a pressure.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.514
No femoral pulse.
Check a doppler.

18:01.548 --> 18:05.385
V-fib, crash cart, thoracotomy
tray, and prep the chest.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.453
It's blunt trauma.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.321
She had a pulse
and was talking.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.457
10 blade. Get FFP
from the blood bank

18:10.490 --> 18:11.624
and page
cardiothoracic.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.792
Yeah, if they
can get here.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.161
The husband wants
to come in.

18:14.194 --> 18:14.761
BOTH:
No!

18:14.794 --> 18:15.728
Rib spreader.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.397
Metz and pick-ups.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.466
Nathan.
Sir, you've got
to come with me.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.433
Sir?

18:20.467 --> 18:23.870
( Corday grunts )

18:23.903 --> 18:26.706
Oh, God...
No pericardial
effusion

18:26.739 --> 18:27.707
no cardiac
lacerations.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.442
Satinsky.
Nathan, now.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.510
Sir, you've got to
come outside with me.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.511
No.
Yes!

18:31.544 --> 18:32.912
I'm her husband, I'm...

18:32.945 --> 18:34.814
Your wife is
bleeding into
her chest.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.583
The doctors are
trying to save her;
now come with me.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.585
Aorta is cross
clamped at 10:27.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.886
Heart's empty.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.588
Empty?!
Please, please,
please...

18:41.621 --> 18:43.223
Blood must be in
the right chest.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.324
Get me another tube.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.592
Set up a thoraseal!

18:45.625 --> 18:46.593
Dr. Corday.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
Swab stick,
suction on high.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.330
The boy's not
oxygenating
on 100%.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.832
Carter thinks a
rib punctured
his heart.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.568
( sighs )

18:55.602 --> 18:58.205
Squeeze in four units
then try to defibrillate.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.272
CARTER:
3-0 nylon
and opsite.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.307
What happened?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.808
Rib lacerated
his LAD.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.344
He's got a huge
V-Q mismatch,
low pO2

19:04.377 --> 19:06.379
and diminished
lung compliance.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.881
Troponin is 32,
CK 925 with 20% MB.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.283
He's having a massive MI.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.518
Cath lab first?

19:11.551 --> 19:13.653
Probably irreversible
heart muscle damage.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.755
Okay, let's call
cards and set
up for a swan.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.590
Carter, Abby on two?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.392
All right; just get a number,
see if I can call her back.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.328
Ectopy!
You can't repair the
coronary artery?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.796
It'll just be feeding
a dead heart.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.332
Another run, ten beats.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.434
CARTER:
Hemodynamically
stable.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.272
Okay, okay,
call the perfusionist.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.906
We're going to put him

19:33.940 --> 19:34.874
on bypass.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.243
Bypass?
Just do it.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.610
Susan! Susan!

19:37.644 --> 19:38.945
Neuro-surg is on
the way

19:38.978 --> 19:40.380
but all they can offer
is ICP monitoring.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.414
No subdural?

19:41.448 --> 19:42.582
Diffuse cerebral
edema

19:42.615 --> 19:44.284
with intraparenchymal
bleeding

19:44.317 --> 19:45.752
and complete
effacement of
the ventricles.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.420
Knocked out the
brain stem.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.822
Okay, get a stat EEG
and mobilize transplant service.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.624
Transplant?
Toby?
Is that Toby?

19:51.658 --> 19:54.394
Sir, sir, I'm Dr. Corday.
I need a word with you.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.728
Aren't you working
on my wife?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.664
I'm working on
your family.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.433
Uh, how bad is he hurt?

20:00.467 --> 20:01.834
He wasn't talking.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.704
There's a massive swelling
of his brain.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.706
He... he's in a coma?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.375
No...

20:08.408 --> 20:10.377
he's brain dead,
I'm afraid.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.778
Brain dead?
I'm sorry.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.680
Dr. Corday, we still
can't get a rhythm.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.781
Be right there.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.249
1500cc's out the right side.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.484
Susan, can you
help Luka?

20:17.517 --> 20:18.918
Yeah. Get him
in the suture room.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.553
Look, I know
this is sudden.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.755
But your other son Matt,
his heart is failing.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.525
The artery that feeds it
was severed by his rib.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.893
His lungs are bruised
and filled with blood.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.261
Oh, God.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.729
I'm afraid his
only chance

20:29.762 --> 20:31.464
is a heart and
lung transplant

20:31.498 --> 20:32.799
within the next
six hours.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.766
Do you understand?

20:33.800 --> 20:34.934
School was canceled

20:34.967 --> 20:37.337
and, uh, the,
the, street was blocked.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.339
The boys just wanted
to make a snowman...

20:39.372 --> 20:40.807
Sir, do you
understand?

20:40.840 --> 20:42.942
I need your permission
to take Toby's heart

20:42.975 --> 20:44.311
and lungs and give
them to Matt.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.679
What?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.448
This son is dead.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.783
I might have a chance
to save your other one.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.320
No, no, you just
s-save them... save them both.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.621
I can't.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.723
Elizabeth, you need to open
a right chest.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.958
Kids... kids
are resilient,
they bounce back.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.860
Elizabeth, I might need you!

21:00.893 --> 21:03.996
Not now.
Drunken driver with
distracting injuries.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.532
No!

21:05.565 --> 21:06.933
Look, I know
this is difficult

21:06.966 --> 21:08.735
but I need
your consent now.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.570
You can't just wait
a couple days

21:10.603 --> 21:11.771
and see if...
he wakes up?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.673
Elizabeth.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.775
Sir, I'll be right back.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.345
Nathan.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.079
Okay. You need
to calm him down

21:20.112 --> 21:21.781
explain it to him,
get consent.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.783
He's not in the proper
state of mind to understand.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.352
So you make him
understand.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.721
We just have one shot
at his other boy.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.593
What? They're worried about
national security?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.462
It's protocol--
military's big on it.

21:35.495 --> 21:38.365
Yeah, but they already said they
were going to discharge him.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.066
How long can it
take to talk to
your lawyer?

21:40.099 --> 21:42.101
I guess he needed
to brief him on
the hearing.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.436
Hey, there's a PX
a few buildings over.

21:43.470 --> 21:45.438
You want
something to eat?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.707
Hey, you, uh, you
haven't eaten anything

21:47.740 --> 21:48.541
since last night.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.876
I'm fine.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.044
Mrs. Wyczenski?
She's fine,
too.

21:52.078 --> 21:55.582
Look, Gallant, you
came here to help
me get on base

21:55.615 --> 21:56.583
and I got on base.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.684
Thank you.

21:57.717 --> 21:58.685
Now you should go.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.454
I mean, I can stay.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.655
You have a test.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.090
Well, Dr. Carter
said if I didn't...

22:04.123 --> 22:05.492
I don't care what
Dr. Carter said.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.959
Dr. Carter's
not here.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.928
And besides, this
is my family.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.996
You should go.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.864
Well, there's
only one car.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.533
Mom, do you have
a rent-a-car?

22:13.566 --> 22:14.567
Yes.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.602
You take it.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.103
Come on, go, go.

22:17.136 --> 22:20.473
Okay, I'm going
to take him over
in 45 minutes.

22:20.507 --> 22:21.608
Can I go in now?

22:21.641 --> 22:23.109
He asked to see
his mom.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.411
Okay, let's go.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.413
Uh, only his mom.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.147
Does he know
I'm here?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.516
Yes, ma'am.

22:29.549 --> 22:33.019
And he doesn't want to see me?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.723
Not right now, ma'am.

22:39.626 --> 22:41.761
I'll talk to him, Abby,
he'll come around.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.564
Right this way.

22:44.597 --> 22:48.134
( electric saw buzzing )

22:48.167 --> 22:49.602
CORDAY:
Spreader.

22:49.636 --> 22:52.572
At least two more
liters in the right chest.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.673
Suction.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.641
Vascular clamp.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.643
Looks like a hilar injury.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.446
Tore the pulmonary
artery and vein.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.914
Got it.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.450
Resuming
compressions.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.618
Is he getting
consent?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.053
CORDAY:
He's trying.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.021
JARVIK:
Hemacue is 6.2

23:09.055 --> 23:09.689
Comes in handy,
I guess.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.123
What?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.526
He's good at talking
patients into stuff.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.894
Cross another eight
of packed cells.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.195
She's in arrest
too long.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.597
We only got hemostasis
a minute ago.

23:17.630 --> 23:20.166
He's in v-tach!

23:20.199 --> 23:21.534
Four more units
on the rapid infuser

23:21.568 --> 23:22.034
then you're done.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.603
35 kilos.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.472
Charge to 50.
Where's my perfusionist?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.507
He's still trying to
get through the snow.
Everybody clear?

23:27.540 --> 23:30.943
( machine buzzing )
.35 milligrams
of one to 10,000 of EPI.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.044
Sinus!

23:32.078 --> 23:33.112
Okay, bolus lidocaine and...

23:33.145 --> 23:34.847
V-tach, pulseless.

23:34.881 --> 23:35.948
Starting CPR.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.149
CARTER:
All right, 120 again.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.485
I got it.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.486
He consented?

23:39.519 --> 23:40.487
I showed him
the EEG.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.488
And everybody clear?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.922
( machine buzzing )

23:42.955 --> 23:45.892
( alarms sound )

23:45.925 --> 23:47.527
The heart's ischemic
and the lungs

23:47.560 --> 23:48.895
can't oxygenate;
we need to move
him to the OR.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.196
Whoa, we don't even have
a stable rhythm yet.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.731
Lidocaine, another 20

23:51.764 --> 23:52.765
IV push
and charge.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.100
You got
his signature?

23:54.133 --> 23:55.768
He's signing
now.
And clear.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.169
( machine buzzing )

23:57.203 --> 23:59.506
Sinus.
Okay, then get
his brother upstairs.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.940
Come on, man,
hold right there.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.609
Okay, Chuny, we need
that transplant team here now.

24:02.642 --> 24:03.510
Back to v-fib.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.811
Damn it.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.713
All right, charge again
to 120, procainamide

24:06.746 --> 24:08.681
300 milligrams IV over
the next half hour;
charge again.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.016
( alarm changes )
Wait!

24:10.049 --> 24:11.150
Back to sinus.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.785
Okay, that's it, let's go.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.787
Lido infusion at 40 mikes
per kilo per minute.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.022
We shouldn't move him.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.256
We have a window,
he's in sinus now.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.091
Yeah, for ten seconds.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.628
If we need to get him on bypass,
he can't last that long.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.663
You want to do this?
Heart transplant?

24:23.696 --> 24:25.131
You have any other ideas?

24:25.164 --> 24:29.035
I'm here, kiddo,
it's not going to hurt.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.938
I'm here.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.211
CORDAY:
We'll set up in the OR.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.113
Have the bypass packages
standing by.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.149
Subclavian?
No, femoral, ten French.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.817
Activate again,
we got to hustle.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.052
What's wrong?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.854
Hey, hold the elevator!

24:47.887 --> 24:50.723
Sats down to 78.
He needs
to be suctioned.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.224
You got to make this work.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.826
We'll do our best.
No, you
promise me.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.127
You promise me
this is going to work!

24:55.161 --> 24:57.063
I'm sorry,
we have to get upstairs.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.665
Pressure's
down to 80 systolic...

24:59.198 --> 25:00.099
Uh...

25:00.132 --> 25:01.968
( sighs )

25:02.001 --> 25:03.736
It's okay, baby.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.638
You're going to help
your brother, okay?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.140
You're going to help
your brother.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.277
Uh, my wife--

25:11.310 --> 25:15.214
uh, we'll bring him
in to my wife

25:15.247 --> 25:17.650
and she's going to say good-bye.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.891
Amp of bicarb in.
I think I broke
his last rib.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.225
Keep going.
Good pulse with compression.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.860
Shirley, where are we headed?
OR Two.

25:27.894 --> 25:29.061
V fib.
Damn it.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.763
Hold compressions.
Where are the paddles?

25:30.797 --> 25:32.164
Charging.
Clear.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.334
Oh, battery is dead, come on!

25:35.367 --> 25:37.169
Let's go. Check
the connection.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.204
Still energized.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.006
Okay, stop, clear.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.208
( sighs )

25:42.241 --> 25:43.876
Okay, battery's dead.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.177
Let's go, grab the slider.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.178
150.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.346
CARTER:
Charged.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.815
Clear.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.251
Sinus.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.254
Three milligrams per kilo
of heparin.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.090
Then prep for THI cannula.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.659
CARTER:
One, two, three.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.327
CORDAY:
Where's my
transplant team?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.294
What do you want me to do?

26:02.328 --> 26:03.930
Keep him in V fib.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.098
Heparin's in,
waiting on gradient.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.934
Run a V tach,
half bolus of lidocaine.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.235
200 units per kilo.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.369
Sinus.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.871
Then one per mil of prime.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.339
Shirley?
Right here.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.174
Okay, meet the donor
at the elevator.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.175
Get him prepped
next door.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.343
CARTER:
Repeat BP.

26:17.376 --> 26:19.211
MARQUEZ:
100/60.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.713
Ten blade.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.034
Starting bypass at 11:46.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.169
Hey.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.170
You just got him hooked up now?

26:44.203 --> 26:45.872
LAD is shredded.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.974
Irreversible ischemic damage
to the left ventricle.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.341
And I thought I had a snow day.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.277
Get the harvest team going.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.014
Wow.

26:55.047 --> 26:56.015
Yeah.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.016
Wow.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.050
Yeah.

26:58.084 --> 26:59.285
( sighs )

26:59.318 --> 27:00.352
He doesn't blame you.

27:00.386 --> 27:01.954
He just can't hide from you.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.390
You saw him manic,
and he hasn't accepted it yet.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.859
He's taking the meds.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.094
Not by choice.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.696
That could
take some time.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.698
He's emotionally
exhausted...

27:11.731 --> 27:13.432
and he's ashamed.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.702
Try not be
confrontational.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.938
I've got this down, thanks.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.179
Hi.

27:27.213 --> 27:30.717
Were you expecting
a straitjacket?

27:31.918 --> 27:34.987
No.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.989
You look nice.

27:37.023 --> 27:40.126
Oh, fashion is key
at a court-martial.

27:40.159 --> 27:43.195
It's not really
a court-martial, right?

27:43.229 --> 27:45.297
It's a-a Rule 70...

27:45.331 --> 27:47.399
I know what
it is, Abby.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.370
You wanted out anyway, right?

27:51.403 --> 27:54.340
Yeah. It's all a ploy.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.948
You know I love you, right?

28:01.981 --> 28:04.283
You know that.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.453
I was worried about you
because I love you.

28:07.486 --> 28:08.855
And you think I'm crazy?

28:08.888 --> 28:10.857
No, not crazy.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.024
Oh, right.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.259
Um... sick.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.761
Mentally unstable.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.095
Suddenly plagued

28:16.128 --> 28:18.464
by a psychiatric illness.

28:18.497 --> 28:22.902
Truth is, I was having...
a pretty good time.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.837
( clears throat )

28:24.871 --> 28:27.073
I want you to come
back to Chicago with me.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.407
( laughing ):
Oh, wow!

28:28.440 --> 28:30.509
That sounds
like a lot
of fun. Um...

28:30.542 --> 28:32.344
Maybe you could
call the MPs again.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.380
Eric, you've seen this.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.416
You know if you
don't stay medicated

28:37.449 --> 28:39.151
it can get bad.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.286
I mean, bad.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.054
You could end
up wasting...

28:42.088 --> 28:43.489
Abby, she's right here.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.224
Yeah, I know she is.
It's not a secret.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.793
She knows it.
She'll tell you.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.294
She will tell you.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.796
Mom, tell him.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.232
Tell him, Mom!

28:54.867 --> 28:57.804
Mom, tell him.

29:03.810 --> 29:06.145
I'll be in the waiting room.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.515
What the hell, Abby?

29:09.548 --> 29:11.383
Yeah, what the hell.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.386
You called her?

29:14.420 --> 29:15.822
You didn't... do... ?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.089
It took me three
days to find you

29:17.123 --> 29:18.157
and I had to
talk my way

29:18.190 --> 29:19.258
onto the base...

29:19.291 --> 29:20.459
I didn't ask you to do that.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.828
Yeah, but you
called her?

29:21.861 --> 29:22.995
The most unreliable

29:23.029 --> 29:24.864
undependable person
in our lives?

29:24.897 --> 29:26.332
And you're dependable?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.500
Yeah, to you I am, yes.

29:28.534 --> 29:31.437
Well, I'm sorry.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.406
I have to apologize
to poor Abby.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.475
Poor, poor Abby.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.077
My career is over

29:38.110 --> 29:40.913
but she doesn't get
to be the savior again.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.581
You need help Eric,
and Mom screwed up

29:42.614 --> 29:43.916
the first time you went to her.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.985
One-- I don't need help.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.154
And two-- I didn't go to her.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.456
She thought she saw something.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.191
She dragged me to her doctor.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.592
I went to make her happy

29:53.625 --> 29:55.494
and her doctor proved her wrong.

29:55.527 --> 29:58.297
She wasn't wrong.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.567
Then why am I not allowed
to call her?

30:03.102 --> 30:06.072
Better get going, Sergeant.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.273
MAN:
Hey

30:07.306 --> 30:09.208
Make sure you
check my knee, too.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.409
It's killing me.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.445
I hit it on the
steering column.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.981
Do you hear me?

30:15.014 --> 30:16.448
Yes.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.385
Then get me something
for the pain, brother.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.888
Oh, all the alcohol wasn't
enough... brother?

30:21.921 --> 30:23.956
I only had one beer.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.591
This the driver?

30:25.624 --> 30:26.993
Right side tenderness.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.361
The ultrasound looks clear.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.533
Hey, what's your
problem, man?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.535
You got Tourette's
or something?

30:36.568 --> 30:39.271
Did you do it?

30:39.305 --> 30:40.339
Ask me in six hours.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.974
The transplant team is working.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.542
Did you talk to the father?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.144
Large seat belt contusion.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.645
Safety first.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.881
They let you be a
doctor like this?

30:48.915 --> 30:52.151
Only on the patients
they don't care about.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.620
Hey, did you just diss me, man?

30:54.653 --> 30:56.588
I think he just dissed me.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.590
Do-do you know what you did?

30:58.624 --> 31:00.459
Do you have any idea?

31:00.492 --> 31:02.294
Uh, yeah, I banged up my knee.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.562
No, you killed
a whole family--

31:03.595 --> 31:04.596
a mother, her
two little kids.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.298
No, I hit a snowman.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.334
They were making a
snowman, you jerk!

31:08.367 --> 31:10.602
Mr. Nathan, perhaps you should
help out with another patient.

31:18.210 --> 31:22.614
You have to give him time, Abby.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.988
Oh, now you speak?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.489
Now you have an opinion?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.992
He can't feel
we're ganging up on him.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.097
Just don't push him.

31:38.130 --> 31:40.299
I didn't... push him.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.402
You're already talking
about going back to Chicago.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.538
They are discharging
him, Mother.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.540
What do you suggest?

31:48.574 --> 31:52.244
We put him up
in a psychiatric
hospital in Omaha?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.514
I'm not so sure
he should be hospitalized.

31:55.547 --> 31:59.085
Well, that's not
really your decision.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.120
Is it yours?

32:01.153 --> 32:04.156
You know, he only looks normal
because he's on Depakote.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.424
And if you had
seen him...

32:05.457 --> 32:07.626
I know the pathology, sweetie.

32:10.129 --> 32:12.098
And yes

32:12.131 --> 32:14.700
the easy thing would probably be
to try to commit him.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.236
( laughs )

32:17.269 --> 32:18.604
Easy?

32:18.637 --> 32:20.572
But he's got
to accept the disease

32:20.606 --> 32:22.741
accommodate it.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.676
And until he does

32:24.710 --> 32:26.145
he needs to be
supervised

32:26.178 --> 32:28.580
or he will go
off his meds.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.017
You always did.

32:31.017 --> 32:34.720
Well, he probably will
at one time or another.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.161
But Abby, trust me on this.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.395
It's like AA.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.364
It's got to be his decision.

32:45.397 --> 32:48.067
He's got to want it,
and it's way too early for that.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.371
Mom, I have been living
with this disease

32:52.404 --> 32:53.572
my entire life.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.708
Please, don't lecture me.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.778
I know you've been living
with this your entire life

32:59.811 --> 33:01.747
but you've never been inside it.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.082
What is that?

33:03.115 --> 33:04.150
What is that?

33:04.183 --> 33:05.617
"Inside it"

33:05.651 --> 33:08.087
like you two have some sort
of special bond now.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.289
'Cause you're both inside of it.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.523
Abby, stop it!

33:11.557 --> 33:13.059
This is about Eric.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.061
You can't go back
to the way you two were.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.395
There's no quick fix.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.530
Your brother will be
struggling with this

33:18.564 --> 33:20.699
for the rest of his life.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.735
Abby?

33:27.473 --> 33:29.641
Has she been vomiting?

33:29.675 --> 33:30.742
Twice this morning.

33:30.776 --> 33:31.777
She started
to run a fever

33:31.810 --> 33:33.112
so I brought her in.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.680
Well, is anybody else
sick at home?

33:34.713 --> 33:37.349
Her little brother
had an earache a
couple days ago

33:37.383 --> 33:38.384
but he seems fine now.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.219
Okay, well,
let's take a look.

33:40.252 --> 33:44.356
MAN:
Well, you can't take
my blood alcohol.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.658
I don't give you permission.

33:46.692 --> 33:47.826
We don't need
your permission.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.428
So are you hungry at all, Kiley?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.696
No.
No?

33:50.729 --> 33:52.331
Any diarrhea,
Mom?
No.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.403
( screaming and crying )

33:57.436 --> 33:58.570
I'm sorry.
What happened?

33:58.604 --> 33:59.838
It was an accident.
I'm sorry.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.273
I think I scared her
more than anything.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.341
Are you all right,
honey?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.742
Did you hit the TM?
No.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.644
He just jammed that thing
in my daughter's ear.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.779
I don't think
I really hurt her.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.114
Well, why is
she crying?

34:09.148 --> 34:11.817
( crying continues )

34:11.850 --> 34:13.185
Here.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.353
Where are
you going?

34:14.386 --> 34:15.654
I'm going home.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.422
Come back here and
finish the work-up.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.126
No, thank you.

34:32.871 --> 34:34.773
We were able

34:34.806 --> 34:36.775
to get Matt stabilized
on bypass.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.411
The transplant
team's at work.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.748
Is there anybody
you'd like me to call?

34:45.917 --> 34:48.387
When will you know?

34:48.420 --> 34:51.723
It's a delicate procedure,
especially on children.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.860
There's a waiting room
on the third floor.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.763
I can take you
there if you'd like.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.299
I can't seem to...

35:00.332 --> 35:02.834
walk out of this room.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.571
What-what time is it?

35:05.604 --> 35:09.275
Uh...

35:09.308 --> 35:11.443
it's almost 5:00.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.348
I'd be getting home about now.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.885
Sylvia would probably
pick up a pizza

35:19.918 --> 35:21.853
or some Chinese

35:21.887 --> 35:24.356
because she got busy
with the boys after school

35:24.390 --> 35:26.458
and didn't have time to cook.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.830
Toby'd have a picture
that he drew

35:31.863 --> 35:34.833
that he'd want me to look at.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.537
Matt would want me
to test him on his math.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.808
You made the right decision.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.244
The only one you could.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.315
We woke up this morning.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.485
Everything was white.

35:53.519 --> 35:57.223
And they were so happy.

35:57.223 --> 36:01.860
We all got to stay home.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.299
It may not seem like it,
but, um...

36:07.333 --> 36:09.468
I know what you're feeling.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.703
I-I understand what
you're feeling.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.639
I'm sorry, Doctor

36:13.672 --> 36:16.508
but you-you don't know
what I'm feeling.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.444
You don't have any idea.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.746
I don't even know.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.658
My husband--

36:32.691 --> 36:35.661
his name was Mark-- he died...

36:35.694 --> 36:38.630
My God, I was about
to say last year.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.799
It was only
six months ago.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.840
I tried to pretend

36:48.874 --> 36:51.777
once Mark was gone,
that I could pull myself up

36:51.810 --> 36:55.381
continue like normal.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.549
But it doesn't work like that.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.356
You see, you can't
run away from it.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.724
It's...

37:05.757 --> 37:07.959
It's like this big,
relentless wave...

37:07.993 --> 37:10.462
( sighs )

37:10.496 --> 37:12.531
...that you have to ride.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.002
But in riding it

37:17.035 --> 37:21.607
somehow, you hold on
to what you've lost.

37:23.475 --> 37:27.979
And you find a way to go on
without shutting off.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.352
It's not easy, but you do it.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.991
I know...

37:40.025 --> 37:41.927
someday soon

37:41.960 --> 37:46.565
when you look
into your child's eyes

37:46.598 --> 37:49.735
all you will see are
the beautiful things

37:49.768 --> 37:52.871
that live on in him.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.909
He needs to be okay.

37:59.945 --> 38:03.449
I need him to be okay.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.786
He will be.

38:11.523 --> 38:14.660
( crying )

38:14.693 --> 38:16.695
He will be.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.367
Based on his testimony
at the board

38:21.400 --> 38:22.834
they feel they don't have
enough information

38:22.868 --> 38:24.503
to conclude that he
was mentally incompetent.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.571
So what's he
doing here?

38:25.604 --> 38:27.939
He's demanding
due process.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.608
I'm trying to contact
the convening authority

38:29.641 --> 38:31.510
to get him released
from pretrial confinement.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.980
The door doesn't open
from the inside

38:35.013 --> 38:37.082
so just pick up the phone
when you're finished.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.517
Thank you.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.757
You requested
a court-martial?

38:45.791 --> 38:47.426
No.

38:47.459 --> 38:50.396
That's what the lawyer says
they're looking at.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.730
I was gone less
than 30 days.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.064
The worst they'll do
is discharge me.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.866
Maybe give me a couple
weeks confinement.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.536
You don't have
a couple weeks.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.405
I haven't hurt anyone.

38:59.405 --> 39:00.872
I haven't broken
any laws.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.741
I haven't acted
irresponsibly.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.109
I just needed
a change.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.877
You went AWOL.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.446
But that's between
me and them.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.747
They want me to say I'm crazy.

39:08.780 --> 39:09.915
I'm not going to say it.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.517
Nobody's saying
you're crazy.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.751
You're saying I'm crazy.

39:12.784 --> 39:13.919
No, I'm not.

39:13.952 --> 39:14.753
Come on, Abby!

39:14.786 --> 39:15.987
You were there.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.490
You even tried to
hide it from me.

39:18.524 --> 39:19.558
Mom was crazy.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.560
She was out-of-her-mind crazy

39:21.593 --> 39:22.961
and I'm not like that!

39:23.962 --> 39:26.998
I'm not her.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.935
You can say it all you want.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.970
I'm not her.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.847
CORDAY:
Hey.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.451
Shirley, uh, she said
she saw you out here

39:45.451 --> 39:47.886
on her break almost
an hour ago.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.087
Are you okay?

39:51.657 --> 39:53.459
No symptoms.

39:53.492 --> 39:56.995
It's perfect
timing, huh?

40:01.833 --> 40:02.968
You need something?

40:08.073 --> 40:12.811
I owe it to you to give you this
in person... your evaluation.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.516
You're not going
to open it?

40:17.549 --> 40:18.917
Open it for what?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.954
There's no middle ground
with you, is there?

40:22.988 --> 40:25.724
Blind optimism
or self-pity.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.626
It's just the truth.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.964
It's going to cripple me.

40:32.998 --> 40:34.666
( sighs )

40:34.700 --> 40:37.869
Just when I learn how to deal
with another symptom

40:37.903 --> 40:39.170
it progresses.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.872
What were you expecting?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.974
Time.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.043
I expected time.

40:45.076 --> 40:49.881
Enough time
to figure out a...

40:53.051 --> 40:55.687
Time is going to kick my ass.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.689
So, what, that's it?

40:57.723 --> 41:00.592
You're just going to give in?

41:00.626 --> 41:02.260
Isn't that what you wanted?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.929
No.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.132
No, I wanted you to recognize
your limitations.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.037
I thought you were trying
to prove something

41:12.070 --> 41:15.907
but you probably saved that
little boy's life today.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.909
You connected
with his father

41:17.943 --> 41:19.678
when he was
completely lost.

41:19.711 --> 41:24.015
You guided him
to make the
right decision.

41:24.049 --> 41:29.054
Any idiot can suture a wound
or put in a chest tube.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.122
But you have a gift, Mr. Nathan.

41:31.156 --> 41:34.259
The gift
of a physician.

41:34.292 --> 41:39.565
Now it's up to you to decide
if you want to share that gift

41:39.598 --> 41:43.935
and then find a way.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.211
By the way,
I keep my promises.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.980
I failed you.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.980
All they had
was diet Shasta.

42:29.014 --> 42:30.616
They still make this?

42:30.616 --> 42:32.283
I hope so.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.219
( opens soda can )

42:34.252 --> 42:35.887
Um...

42:35.921 --> 42:40.225
they might ask you
to testify, you know.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.093
Yeah.

42:42.127 --> 42:44.362
Mom, I need you to be
with me on this.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.632
He can't stay
in military jail.

42:46.632 --> 42:47.999
I'm with you.

42:55.674 --> 42:57.108
I'm sorry.

43:00.045 --> 43:04.115
( sighs heavily )

43:04.149 --> 43:09.087
I'm just scared for him,
and I'm... angry.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.024
I'm angry at you...
for having to do this again

43:13.058 --> 43:15.093
and you didn't do anything.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.828
No.

43:16.862 --> 43:20.065
You're angry at me for...
giving it to him.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.700
No, no, no, I didn't...

43:21.733 --> 43:24.803
Nah... I know you feel
like a mother to him.

43:24.836 --> 43:29.875
Why shouldn't you?

43:29.908 --> 43:33.912
But I'm his mother
and I gave it to him.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.948
I gave it to my son.

43:36.982 --> 43:44.723
All I can do now is...
try to be his mother.

43:44.756 --> 43:46.858
( phone ringing )

43:46.892 --> 43:48.760
I'm sorry, I gave his lawyer
this number.

43:48.794 --> 43:50.195
Go ahead.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.898
I'm going to try to find us
a hotel room.

43:52.931 --> 43:54.365
This may take a few days.

43:57.435 --> 43:59.037
Hello?

43:59.070 --> 44:01.272
CARTER:
Hey, you turned on
your cell phone.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.841
Hi.

44:02.874 --> 44:05.110
Well, did you find him?

44:05.143 --> 44:07.245
Yeah, I found him.

44:07.278 --> 44:10.048
They might court-martial him,
but I found him.

44:10.081 --> 44:13.118
Did you tell them
that he was sick?

44:13.151 --> 44:14.720
They already knew.

44:14.753 --> 44:16.154
It's a long story.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.723
You still snowed in?

44:17.756 --> 44:19.324
Oh, the city's a mess.

44:19.357 --> 44:22.393
How are you holding up?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.172
Chuny, do we have
any spare monitors?

44:34.205 --> 44:35.173
For what?

44:35.206 --> 44:36.141
Fiber-optic otoscope.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.776
Oh, try Trauma One.

44:40.812 --> 44:41.813
GIRL:
It's a big machine.

44:41.847 --> 44:43.148
Can she get something to eat?

44:43.181 --> 44:44.916
She's starting to get her
appetite back.

44:44.950 --> 44:46.117
That's a good sign.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.185
What do you feel
like eating, Kiley?

44:47.218 --> 44:49.087
Pizza.
Pizza?

44:49.120 --> 44:51.990
That sounds good, but
you should probably
just have some soup

44:52.023 --> 44:53.124
until your
tummy's settled.

44:53.158 --> 44:54.459
All right,
the CT is negative.

44:54.492 --> 44:56.327
She can go home,
drink some clear liquids

44:56.361 --> 44:57.963
and come back tomorrow
for a recheck.

44:57.996 --> 44:59.330
Excuse me, Dr. Weaver.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.099
I never finished checking
Kiley's ear.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.901
Oh, you don't have
to do that-- we're fine.

45:02.934 --> 45:04.335
It's okay, I'm not going
to hurt her.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.004
In fact,
Kiley's going to help me.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.139
Can you tell him
that we're fine?

45:08.173 --> 45:10.108
Don't worry,
she's safe.

45:10.141 --> 45:11.843
I think I saw something.

45:11.877 --> 45:14.112
So I want you to hold
the scope

45:14.145 --> 45:16.447
and I want you to put it
in your ear very gently, okay?

45:16.481 --> 45:18.016
You can get to watch it
on TV.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.250
Me?

45:19.284 --> 45:23.154
Yeah, you get to be
the doctor.

45:23.188 --> 45:24.455
Is that my ear?

45:24.489 --> 45:27.258
Actually,
it's your eardrum.

45:27.292 --> 45:28.426
Gross.

45:28.459 --> 45:29.394
Use cotton swabs?

45:29.427 --> 45:30.395
Yeah, every night.

45:30.428 --> 45:32.097
See,
that's the problem.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.299
The cotton swab rubs
the protective wax
out of the ear.

45:34.332 --> 45:35.801
It can cause
an ear infection.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.002
And what can you do
about that?

45:37.035 --> 45:38.804
Well, I could give her
some drops

45:38.837 --> 45:41.539
but it's better if she just
never sticks anything in her ear

45:41.572 --> 45:42.874
smaller than her elbow.

45:42.908 --> 45:44.175
My elbow?

45:44.209 --> 45:46.044
I can't fit my elbow.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.245
You can't?

45:47.278 --> 45:48.313
Mr. Nathan

45:48.346 --> 45:49.347
are you almost finished?

45:49.380 --> 45:50.481
Yeah, almost.

45:50.515 --> 45:52.083
You're needed
upstairs.

45:52.117 --> 45:53.318
What is it?

45:53.351 --> 45:56.221
Field is dry.
Anastomosis sites intact.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.924
Elizabeth, you're either going
to make me famous

45:58.957 --> 46:01.026
or get me arrested
for cases like this.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.560
Mr. Nathan,
Dr. Carmichael.

46:02.593 --> 46:05.897
I toil for eight hours,
you're the one with the honors.

46:05.931 --> 46:06.832
Excuse me?

46:06.865 --> 46:08.299
Over here.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.268
MAN:
Cardioplegia solution
is withdrawn.

46:10.301 --> 46:11.369
Okay...

46:11.402 --> 46:13.138
Shut it down.

46:13.171 --> 46:15.306
This is the part
where you jump out
of the airplane

46:15.340 --> 46:16.274
and hope you packed

46:16.307 --> 46:17.342
the chute correctly.

46:17.375 --> 46:18.877
Better grab those paddles.

46:18.910 --> 46:20.211
What?

46:20.245 --> 46:22.513
Paddles-- we're going
to need them.

46:28.186 --> 46:30.221
MAN:
V-fib.

46:30.255 --> 46:31.256
That's your cue.

46:40.531 --> 46:45.236
Clear.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.072
MAN:
Heart rate, 70.

46:47.105 --> 46:49.540
( quietly ):
Wow.

46:52.043 --> 46:55.180
And that, my friends,
makes it all worthwhile.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.181
Start the epi.

46:56.214 --> 46:57.415
Take down the catheters.

46:57.448 --> 46:59.517
CORDAY:
I guess his brother will always

46:59.550 --> 47:03.188
be with him.

47:03.221 --> 47:07.893
( quietly ):
Wow.
