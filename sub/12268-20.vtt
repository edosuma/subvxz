WEBVTT

00:01.432 --> 00:02.403
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:02.403 --> 00:04.075
THAT'S ALISON STODDARD.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.705
WHAT THE HELL IS CONRAD DOING
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE?

00:05.705 --> 00:07.108
CARRION HAS THE ABILITY

00:07.108 --> 00:09.080
TO KNOCK MANHATTAN
OFF THE POWER GRID

00:09.080 --> 00:10.241
IN LESS THAN A MILLISECOND.

00:10.241 --> 00:11.212
POSE FOR THE CAMERA.
 (camera shutter clicks)

00:11.212 --> 00:13.114
FEEL LIKE PUTTING ON
A SHOW?

00:13.114 --> 00:15.216
(cheering)

00:15.216 --> 00:17.017
I ASSUME YOU'VE KEPT
YOUR PERSONNEL FILES

00:17.017 --> 00:18.149
OF ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES?

00:18.149 --> 00:20.751
I WAS WONDERING IF
I COULD LOOK OVER MATHIS'.

00:20.751 --> 00:22.253
DANIEL'S GROWING SUSPICIOUS
OF YOUR PAST.

00:22.253 --> 00:25.526
ARE YOU DENYING THAT YOU
ABANDONED A 6-MONTH-OLD BOY?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.098
THE STORY IS TRUE.

00:27.098 --> 00:29.200
HELP ME FIND
MY FIRSTBORN SON.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.201
AND IN RETURN?

00:30.201 --> 00:32.103
SOLE OWNER OF NOLCORP.

00:32.103 --> 00:33.404
I CAN'T GO HEAD TO HEAD
WITH THE FALC0N.

00:33.404 --> 00:35.236
HE'S THE BEST THERE IS.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.337
FALC0N?

00:36.337 --> 00:38.539
(camera shutter clicks)
 CHECK YOUR IN-BOX.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.172
YOU'VE MESSED
 WITH THE WRONG PERSON!

00:41.172 --> 00:42.773
I WANNA SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU,

00:42.773 --> 00:45.076
AND ONLY IF YOU WANT
THE SAME.

00:49.450 --> 00:52.453
(siren wailing in distance)

00:54.225 --> 00:57.728
(Emily) ENGAGEMENT CAN BE
 A COMMITMENT TO LOVE...

00:57.728 --> 01:00.461
OR A DECLARATION OF WAR.

01:00.461 --> 01:04.665
ONE MUST ENTER EVERY BATTLE
 WITHOUT HESITATION,

01:04.665 --> 01:07.568
WILLING TO FULLY ENGAGE
 THE ENEMY...

01:07.568 --> 01:09.840
TILL DEATH DO YOU PART.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.245
(Daniel) EMILY?

01:14.245 --> 01:18.109
(string quartet playing)

01:21.652 --> 01:24.715
WHEN YOU SAID YOU WERE BRINGING
ME DINNER AT THE OFFICE...

01:24.715 --> 01:27.418
WELL, I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE PRIVATE,

01:27.418 --> 01:29.190
LESS... IN THE LIMELIGHT.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.565
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

01:34.565 --> 01:35.796
THANK YOU.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.369
(siren wailing in distance)

01:38.369 --> 01:41.202
LE BLANC OU LE ROUGE?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.103
RED.

01:45.336 --> 01:46.607
I KNOW THAT DEVILISH GRIN
OF YOURS.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.108
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

01:48.108 --> 01:52.613
WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.385
HAVE A LOOK.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.188
MM-HMM.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.253
LAST YEAR, MY BIGGEST REGRET

02:02.253 --> 02:04.395
WAS NOT GETTING ON THAT PLANE
WITH YOU.

02:04.395 --> 02:08.258
I JUST HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO SAY "YES."

02:08.258 --> 02:09.430
TO PARIS?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.762
(glass clatters)

02:13.334 --> 02:15.135
TO US.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.839
(both chuckle)

02:18.839 --> 02:20.311
TO US.

02:20.311 --> 02:21.812
(clink)

02:24.275 --> 02:27.348
(seagulls crying)

02:27.348 --> 02:29.250
(Jack)
THOUGHT YOU WENT TO SCHOOL.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.152
CHARLOTTE FLAKED ON ME AGAIN.
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO DRIVE ME.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.424
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

02:33.424 --> 02:36.257
WITH THAT PAPARAZZI VIDEO
OF HER WITH THAT GIRL?

02:36.257 --> 02:38.189
WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT, MAN?

02:38.189 --> 02:39.760
I GOTTA HEAR ABOUT IT
FROM A GROUP OF BARFLIES?

02:39.760 --> 02:40.891
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:40.891 --> 02:42.833
SHE'S IN A REALLY DARK PLACE,
AND SHE'S--

02:42.833 --> 02:45.466
SHE HAS BEEN
EVER SINCE AMANDA...

02:46.667 --> 02:48.239
SHE INTO DRUGS AGAIN?

02:48.239 --> 02:50.241
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

02:50.241 --> 02:51.242
IT'S PRETTY HARD
FOR ME TO TELL

02:51.242 --> 02:52.343
WITH HER BLOWING ME OFF
EVERY DAY.

02:52.343 --> 02:53.504
WHAT ARE YOU...

02:53.504 --> 02:54.675
I NEED MONEY FOR BUS FARE.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.906
HOW MANY BUSES
ARE YOU TAKING?

02:55.906 --> 02:57.378
ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE ME?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.680
ASHLEY'S ON HER WAY OVER.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.182
DID SHE FIND OUT ANYTHING?
I MEAN, IS, UH...

03:02.182 --> 03:03.914
CONRAD SCREWING
THE GOVERNOR'S WIFE?

03:03.914 --> 03:05.386
I'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.418
WHATEVER HE'S UP TO,
THERE'S NO WAY

03:07.418 --> 03:10.190
I'M GONNA LET HIM SLITHER HIS
WAY INTO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.492
HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHY

03:11.492 --> 03:13.464
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BURY
A POLITICIAN 100 FEET DOWN?

03:13.464 --> 03:15.896
'CAUSE DEEP DOWN,
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.899
(door opens)

03:18.899 --> 03:20.501
(door closes)

03:22.603 --> 03:23.934
TELL ME, CONRAD,

03:23.934 --> 03:26.607
WHAT IS YOUR TRUE INTENTION?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.839
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT
YOU WOULDN'T SACRIFICE

03:28.839 --> 03:30.611
AN ASSET
AS VALUABLE AS NOLCORP

03:30.611 --> 03:31.782
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF YOUR HEART.

03:31.782 --> 03:32.983
WELL, WITH THE INITIATIVE

03:32.983 --> 03:35.286
AND THEIR SIZABLE BUSINESS
OUT OF THE PICTURE,

03:35.286 --> 03:37.288
PARING DOWN IS WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE COMPANY.

03:37.288 --> 03:39.390
MM.
 AND IF IT PROMISES TO HASTEN

03:39.390 --> 03:41.852
THE RECOVERY
OF YOUR LONG-LOST SON,

03:41.852 --> 03:43.494
ALL THE BETTER, YES?

03:43.494 --> 03:45.996
FORGIVE ME IF I FIND
THIS SUDDEN GENEROSITY

03:45.996 --> 03:48.699
RINGS ABOUT AS TRUE AS ONE OF
YOUR CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.903
SPEAKING OF BROKEN PROMISES...

03:52.903 --> 03:55.266
34 MORE LETTERS TODAY.

03:55.266 --> 03:58.839
IT SEEMS THAT EVERY ORPHAN
BORN IN '73

03:58.839 --> 04:01.672
IS TRYING TO LAY DUBIOUS CLAIM
TO THE THRONE.

04:01.672 --> 04:05.976
BUT WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT
YOUR REAL SON IS IN THIS MIX?

04:05.976 --> 04:08.279
ALSO DUBIOUS.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.022
CALL IT A MOTHER'S INTUITION.

04:12.022 --> 04:15.586
WELL, BEST OF LUCK
TO MR. ROSS THEN,

04:15.586 --> 04:18.289
AS HE CHASES DOWN
YOUR WILD GOOSE.

04:19.430 --> 04:20.991
AH. PERFECT TIMING.

04:20.991 --> 04:23.734
THIS IS
THE NOLCORP TRANSFER AGREEMENT.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.636
NOW I KNOW IT WAS
YOUR FIRST ACQUISITION,

04:25.636 --> 04:26.697
SO LETTING IT GO MAY BE--

04:26.697 --> 04:28.339
IT I WEREN'T GOOD WITH IT,

04:28.339 --> 04:30.000
I WOULD HAVE VETOED
THE BOARD'S DECISION.
 (doorbell rings)

04:30.000 --> 04:32.943
DANIEL, CAN I STEAL A MOMENT
WITH YOU?

04:32.943 --> 04:34.475
UNLESS, LIKE YOUR SISTER,

04:34.475 --> 04:36.447
YOU'RE STILL GIVING ME
THE COLD SHOULDER OVER THE NEWS.

04:36.447 --> 04:38.879
MOTHER, I'M NEITHER UPSET
NOR SURPRISED

04:38.879 --> 04:40.411
THAT YOU HAVE YET ANOTHER KID
OUT THERE.

04:40.411 --> 04:42.683
BITE YOUR TONGUE. I THINK
YOU KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.014
(chuckles)

04:44.014 --> 04:45.756
AND SINCE WE'RE MAKING
NEW ADDITIONS TO THE FAMILY...

04:45.756 --> 04:47.888
YOU REMEMBER MY FIANCEE.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.020
EMILY AND I ARE RE-ENGAGED.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.522
OH. (chuckles)

04:51.522 --> 04:54.395
ALLOW ME TO OFFER
OUR CONGRATULATIONS.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.926
OH, WHY, THANK YOU, CONRAD.

04:55.926 --> 04:57.297
MM.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.329
YES.

04:58.329 --> 05:01.071
HOW... REPETITIOUS.

05:01.071 --> 05:04.074
WE'RE HOSTING A PARTY TONIGHT
TO SHARE THE GOOD NEWS.

05:04.074 --> 05:05.936
WELL, I CAN ONLY HOPE
THAT YOU OPT FOR

05:05.936 --> 05:08.078
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT
THIS TIME.

05:08.078 --> 05:10.811
ACTUALLY,
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.784
IN TWO WEEKS, DANIEL AND I
TAKE OFF TO PARIS.

05:15.045 --> 05:17.618
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.089
NO.

05:19.089 --> 05:21.622
THAT'S WHERE
WE'RE PLANNING TO LIVE.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.355
(chuckles)

05:42.643 --> 05:43.874
(Victoria) REALLY, DANIEL?

05:43.874 --> 05:45.716
YOUR FIRST ENGAGEMENT TO EMILY
WAS A DISASTER.

05:45.716 --> 05:47.778
WHAT DIFFERENCE
WILL PARIS MAKE?

05:47.778 --> 05:50.451
(exhales) EMILY'S THE ONE,
ALL RIGHT?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.122
IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT ME,
THEN FINE.

05:52.122 --> 05:53.884
BUT I'M NOT LETTING HER
GET AWAY AGAIN.

05:53.884 --> 05:56.387
BESIDES, I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
MY REPLACEMENT

05:56.387 --> 05:57.688
BEFORE THE WEEK'S OUT.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.430
DON'T BE CRUEL,
DANIEL.

05:59.430 --> 06:01.361
YOU AND I HAVE BOTH
MADE MISTAKES.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.033
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
I DON'T MAKE THEM TWICE.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.396
(chuckles) EXCEPT
BASTARD CHILDREN, I GUESS.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.480
THANK YOU.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.783
WELL, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
DANIEL, I'M THRILLED.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.485
YOU ALWAYS DID HAVE
A SOFT SPOT FOR EMILY,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.617
OR AT LEAST HER BANK ACCOUNTS.

06:26.617 --> 06:28.088
OH, WHY WOULDN'T I?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.090
I'VE ALWAYS WISHED
A STABLE FUTURE FOR YOU,

06:30.090 --> 06:32.763
PLUS IF YOU WERE TO RUSH
AN ANNOUNCEMENT

06:32.763 --> 06:33.924
INTO THE "TIMES,"

06:33.924 --> 06:35.996
I PREDICT A BUMP
IN THE POLLS.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.127
(chuckles) YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:37.127 --> 06:38.799
YOU CAN MILK OUR ENGAGEMENT
ALL YOU LIKE.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.970
BUT IN RETURN,

06:39.970 --> 06:41.472
I WANT MY TRUST FUND WITHDRAWN

06:41.472 --> 06:42.933
FROM THE AMANDA CLARKE
FOUNDATION.

06:42.933 --> 06:44.435
SINCE THE INITIATIVE'S
PULLED OUT OF THE COMPANY,

06:44.435 --> 06:46.837
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE HIDING
OUR ASSETS ANYMORE.

06:46.837 --> 06:48.408
WELL, PERHAPS,

06:48.408 --> 06:51.041
BUT YOUR MONEY'S SECURELY
GAINING REMARKABLE INTEREST

06:51.041 --> 06:52.513
RIGHT WHERE IT IS,

06:52.513 --> 06:53.644
RIGHT ALONG WITH THE REST
OF THE FAMILY FORTUNE.

06:53.644 --> 06:55.115
I DON'T CARE.
I WANT ALL MY DUCKS IN A ROW

06:55.115 --> 06:57.187
BY THE TIME I STEP AWAY
FROM GRAYSON GLOBAL.

06:57.187 --> 06:58.989
OH.

06:58.989 --> 07:00.921
AND WHEN YOU SAY AU REVOIR,

07:00.921 --> 07:02.693
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU PLAN TO DO,

07:02.693 --> 07:04.194
NIBBLE CROISSANTS

07:04.194 --> 07:07.558
AND JET AROUND THE WORLD
FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS?

07:07.558 --> 07:09.159
(exhales)

07:09.159 --> 07:10.861
I CAN CERTAINLY SEE
THIS GIRL'S

07:10.861 --> 07:12.633
BURROWED INTO YOUR HEART,
HASN'T SHE?

07:12.633 --> 07:15.466
OH, SHE'S BEEN THERE
SINCE THE DAY I MET HER.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.538
YEAH. I RECOGNIZE
THE SYMPTOMS.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.069
OKAY, BUT AT LEAST WAIT

07:19.069 --> 07:20.941
TO ANNOUNCE YOUR DEPARTURE
FROM THE COMPANY...

07:20.941 --> 07:22.072
(cell phone rings)
 UNTIL AFTER--

07:22.072 --> 07:23.774
AFTER THE ELECTION,
I GET IT.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.445
(ring)

07:25.445 --> 07:27.217
(ring)

07:27.217 --> 07:28.178
(beeps)

07:28.178 --> 07:29.720
GRACE, YOU READ MY MIND.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.181
HEY, CONTACT HuffPo, WILL YOU?

07:31.181 --> 07:33.554
GET AN ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON THE HOME PAGE.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.755
ALREADY ON IT.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.587
AND I HAVE A DELIVERY
FROM TAKEDA INDUSTRIES.

07:36.587 --> 07:38.889
Aiden Mathis'
employee records.

07:38.889 --> 07:40.891
Should I messenger it
to the house?

07:40.891 --> 07:43.193
NO, I'M ON MY WAY IN.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.464
(beep)

07:47.968 --> 07:50.040
(knocks on door)

07:50.040 --> 07:52.072
WORD IS BUZZING
AROUND THE OFFICE.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.245
I BELIEVE CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

07:55.245 --> 07:56.947
YOU THINK I CALLED YOU HERE

07:56.947 --> 07:59.810
TO BREAK THE NEWS
THAT I'M MARRYING EMILY,

07:59.810 --> 08:03.483
MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO HARD FEELINGS?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.985
YOU KNOW, WHEN I HIRED YOU,

08:04.985 --> 08:07.858
I HAD H.R. DO AN EXTENSIVE
BACKGROUND CHECK.

08:07.858 --> 08:10.761
CAME BACK SQUEAKY CLEAN.

08:10.761 --> 08:12.863
SO WHAT DID YOU DO,

08:12.863 --> 08:15.095
PAY THEM OFF, HACK THE SYSTEM
TO ERASE YOUR FILE?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.767
NO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T.
WHY?

08:16.767 --> 08:18.268
ALL RIGHT, SO WHY AM I
ONLY NOW LEARNING

08:18.268 --> 08:19.930
THAT YOUR FATHER
WAS TREVOR MATHIS,

08:19.930 --> 08:22.973
THE BAGGAGE HANDLER SUSPECTED
OF PUTTING A BOMB

08:22.973 --> 08:25.576
ON FLIGHT 1-9-7?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.910
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT INFORMATION
THAT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH--

08:29.910 --> 08:32.613
WITH SHARING, DANIEL.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.815
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE THINGS THAT I HAVE--
 HELP ME TO,

08:34.815 --> 08:36.186
BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE COINCIDENCE
THAT YOU TOOK A JOB HERE

08:36.186 --> 08:38.849
GIVEN GRAYSON GLOBAL'S
COMPLICATED CONNECTION

08:38.849 --> 08:40.650
TO THAT FLIGHT,
TO DAVID CLARKE.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.251
THEY WERE THE SINS
OF MY FATHER, NOT MINE.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.724
AND YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT!

08:43.724 --> 08:47.127
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON,
MATHIS.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.298
(exhales deeply)

08:48.298 --> 08:51.562
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST AFTER MY JOB OR EMILY.

08:51.562 --> 08:53.133
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS MORE
THAN THAT, WASN'T IT?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.705
THAT'S WHY YOU TARGETED
TRASK'S FUNDS.

08:54.705 --> 08:58.008
YOU WERE TRYING
TO GET BACK AT THEM.

08:58.008 --> 08:59.309
WHO'S "THEM"?

09:01.171 --> 09:05.015
WHAT D--WHAT DOES TRASK
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

09:05.015 --> 09:07.718
SECURITY'S GONNA COME UP
AND ESCORT YOU OFF THE PREMISES.

09:07.718 --> 09:09.680
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
YOU'RE FIRED.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.622
SOMEBODY IS CLEARLY TRYING
TO MANIPULATE YOU AGAINST ME.
 (telephone beeps)

09:11.622 --> 09:13.684
LOOK, JUST--JUST TELL ME
WHO IT IS.

09:13.684 --> 09:16.727
SOMEONE I TRUST
FAR MORE THAN YOU.

09:24.795 --> 09:27.337
OKAY.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.573
♪♪♪

09:33.573 --> 09:36.206
JACK, I'M WORKING.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.148
ACTUALLY, THAT...
 (sets glass down)

09:38.148 --> 09:39.950
WAS MINE.

09:39.950 --> 09:41.912
SO WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?
(exhales)

09:41.912 --> 09:43.253
YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW

09:43.253 --> 09:45.015
I'M BACK
IN CONRAD'S GOOD GRACES,

09:45.015 --> 09:46.917
THANKS TO
YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY SKILLS.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.258
BUT AS TO THE NATURE

09:48.258 --> 09:49.860
OF HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH MRS. STODDARD,

09:49.860 --> 09:52.192
I'M AFRAID
I DIDN'T GLEAN MUCH.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.694
(exhales) OKAY, WELL,
THEN LET'S JUST

09:53.694 --> 09:55.796
GO TO THE PRESS WITH THE PHOTO,
PUT IT OUT THERE.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.127
LET THE VOTERS DRAW
THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.769
I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT
THIS PICTURE IS ENOUGH

09:58.769 --> 10:00.270
TO DERAIL CONRAD'S CAMPAIGN.

10:00.270 --> 10:02.803
TIME'S RUNNING OUT.
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.035
I HAVE A SUGGESTION,

10:05.035 --> 10:07.037
BUT IT COMES WITH
ITS OWN SET OF RISKS.

10:07.037 --> 10:09.209
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

10:09.209 --> 10:11.682
HOW BRAVE ARE YOU, JACK?

10:14.344 --> 10:16.286
I ALWAYS DID LOVE
THIS RING.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.148
WELL, WE THOUGHT ABOUT
KEEPING IT A SECRET,

10:18.148 --> 10:19.349
BUT WITH ALL THE PRESS
SURROUNDING THE FAMILY

10:19.349 --> 10:20.721
RIGHT NOW--

10:20.721 --> 10:23.223
UGH. DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT OVEREXPOSURE.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.225
YOU SAW THE VIDEO
OF ME AND MY FRIEND REGINA.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.258
YES, I DID.
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

10:28.258 --> 10:30.130
I WASN'T.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.962
I KEEP WISHING
AMANDA WERE HERE.

10:31.962 --> 10:34.634
SHE'D KNOW
WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.968
UM, NOT WITH THE PRESS.
I JUST MEAN...

10:37.968 --> 10:40.310
(sighs)
IT'S A SISTER THING.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.872
NEVER MIND.

10:41.872 --> 10:43.974
YEAH.

10:43.974 --> 10:46.216
LOOK, I KNOW YOU MISS HER.

10:46.216 --> 10:49.219
SHE CAN NEVER
BE REPLACED.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.152
BUT WE'RE GONNA BE
SISTERS SOON, TOO.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.854
AND I'M HOPING THAT...

10:53.854 --> 10:56.286
YOU'LL BE MORE A PART
OF MY LIFE.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.930
WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE.

10:59.930 --> 11:02.262
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
WOULD BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.794
THAT IS,
IF YOU'LL LEAVE THIS ROOM

11:03.794 --> 11:05.295
LONG ENOUGH TO COME TO PARIS.

11:05.295 --> 11:06.937
OH, MY GOD, EMILY.
OF COURSE.

11:06.937 --> 11:08.098
YEAH?

11:08.098 --> 11:11.301
HATE TO INTERRUPT
THIS HALLMARK MOMENT.

11:11.301 --> 11:13.704
YOU MUST BE REGINA.

11:13.704 --> 11:17.677
WHICH MEANS YOU MUST BE
A USER OF THE INTERNET.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.981
BAD TIME, CHARLIE?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.113
UM, I WAS JUST LEAVING.

11:23.113 --> 11:27.157
WE'LL TALK MORE
AT THE PARTY TONIGHT.

11:27.157 --> 11:28.819
THANKS, EMILY.

11:28.819 --> 11:29.860
BYE.

11:29.860 --> 11:32.122
ANY LUCK?

11:32.122 --> 11:33.323
THE GUY WHO SOLD IT TO ME
DIDN'T BUY

11:33.323 --> 11:34.865
THE WHOLE "FOR A FRIEND" BIT.

11:34.865 --> 11:37.167
SORRY,
BUT GIVEN MY HISTORY,

11:37.167 --> 11:39.830
AND NOW WITH THE TABLOIDS
FOLLOWING ME EVERYWHERE...

11:39.830 --> 11:40.931
I GOT YOUR BACK.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.282
HOW DISGRACEFUL.

11:52.282 --> 11:54.815
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE

11:54.815 --> 11:57.117
TRYING TO CAPITALIZE
ON YOUR PAIN.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.090
EMILY, DEAR, THAT
EXTRAVAGANT RING ON YOUR FINGER

12:00.090 --> 12:02.492
DOES NOT GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO FLIT IN AND OUT OF MY HOUSE

12:02.492 --> 12:04.294
WITHOUT GOOD REASON.

12:04.294 --> 12:05.796
(chuckles)

12:05.796 --> 12:09.029
I WAS HERE ASKING CHARLOTTE
TO BE MY MAID OF HONOR.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.261
(doorbell rings)
 SHE'S REALLY SO EXCITED
TO SEE PARIS.

12:11.261 --> 12:14.164
SHE'S ALREADY SEEN IT,
MULTIPLE TIMES.

12:14.164 --> 12:15.465
I WOULD ASSUME
THAT YOU OF ALL PEOPLE

12:15.465 --> 12:18.869
WOULD APPRECIATE
THE CITY OF LIGHTS, VICTORIA.

12:18.869 --> 12:21.371
AFTER ALL, ISN'T THAT WHERE
YOU ATTENDED ART SCHOOL

12:21.371 --> 12:23.313
ALL OF THOSE YEARS AGO?
 (door closes)

12:23.313 --> 12:26.176
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

12:28.218 --> 12:33.253
AM I EARLY?
 MR. PORTER, OF COURSE.
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.326
YOUR TIMING IS PERFECT
BECAUSE EMILY IS JUST LEAVING.

12:36.326 --> 12:37.958
RIGHT THIS WAY.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.389
SHALL WE?

12:40.931 --> 12:44.294
WE CAN SPEAK PRIVATELY
IN HERE.

12:44.294 --> 12:46.166
GOOD-BYE, EMILY.

12:55.105 --> 12:56.506
I HOPE YOU KNOW

12:56.506 --> 12:58.078
I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
FOR MY FAMILY,

12:58.078 --> 13:01.151
WITH THE FOUNDATION,
TAKING US UNDER YOUR WING.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.856
WHICH IS WHY I...

13:05.856 --> 13:08.088
I THINK YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.860
(beep)

13:09.860 --> 13:12.823
IT'S CONRAD WITH
GOVERNOR STODDARD'S WIFE.

13:12.823 --> 13:13.994
AND IT CERTAINLY
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE

13:13.994 --> 13:16.026
THE FIRST TIME
HE'D MET WITH HER.

13:16.026 --> 13:18.268
WHY ARE YOU SHOWING ME THIS?

13:18.268 --> 13:20.200
WHY NOT JUST APPROACH
MY HUSBAND?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.872
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT THE CAMPAIGN,

13:21.872 --> 13:23.373
AND NO ONE HAS A BETTER CHANCE

13:23.373 --> 13:25.035
OF GETTING THROUGH TO CONRAD
THAN YOU.

13:25.035 --> 13:28.378
THAT PHOTO HAS THE POWER
TO DERAIL HIM.

13:28.378 --> 13:30.010
I DON'T MEAN
TO IMPLY ANYTHING, BUT--

13:30.010 --> 13:31.441
DON'T WORRY, JACK.

13:31.441 --> 13:35.215
MY HUSBAND DOES A FINE JOB
OF IMPLICATING HIMSELF.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.287
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.951
ALL RIGHT.

13:40.951 --> 13:44.324
THEY SAY POLITICS MAKES
FOR STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.

13:46.196 --> 13:48.198
AND FOLKS TEND
TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

13:48.198 --> 13:50.060
WHEN THEY SEE TWO PEOPLE
WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ENEMIES

13:50.060 --> 13:52.402
ACTING LIKE FRIENDS.

13:52.402 --> 13:56.466
THE OPPOSITE OF YOU
AND EMILY THORNE.

13:56.466 --> 13:59.339
YOU USED TO BE VERY CLOSE,
RIGHT?

13:59.339 --> 14:02.212
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
A CHILL IN YOUR FRIENDSHIP.

14:03.914 --> 14:06.576
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT
SHE'S RE-ENGAGED TO MY SON?

14:08.218 --> 14:09.920
I CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.182
YES, WELL...

14:12.182 --> 14:14.254
I DON'T IMAGINE YOU'LL BE
RECEIVING AN INVITATION

14:14.254 --> 14:16.426
TO THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY
TONIGHT,

14:16.426 --> 14:17.928
SEEING AS YOUR TRYST WITH HER

14:17.928 --> 14:19.890
WAS THE REASON THEY
BROKE IT OFF THE FIRST TIME.

14:21.932 --> 14:22.862
OH, DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT?

14:24.594 --> 14:25.936
OH, JACK, MY APOLOGIES.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.204
IT WAS ONE THING WHEN HE WAS
WORKING FOR CONRAD,

14:34.204 --> 14:36.446
BUT WHAT BUSINESS
WOULD JACK HAVE WITH VICTORIA?

14:36.446 --> 14:40.180
MAYBE HE WANTS HER RECIPE
FOR DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.651
I'M SERIOUS, NOLAN.

14:41.651 --> 14:43.883
IF I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S UP TO,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.185
how am I gonna do
anything about it?

14:45.185 --> 14:48.058
YOU REALIZE YOU CAN'T
PROTECT JACK FOREVER,

14:48.058 --> 14:49.319
DON'T YOU?

14:49.319 --> 14:51.221
I made a promise to Amanda,
and I plan to keep it.

14:51.221 --> 14:52.662
I have to go.

14:52.662 --> 14:53.893
(cell phone beeps)

14:53.893 --> 14:56.666
(makes whooshing sound)
 (clatter)

14:56.666 --> 14:59.299
(Regina) NOTHING LIKE
A LITTLE RETAIL THERAPY.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.470
SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

15:00.470 --> 15:02.172
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

15:02.172 --> 15:05.405
I'M TAKING EEYORE OUT
TO BUCK HER UP.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.637
PROMISE NOT TO MAKE
ANY MORE HEADLINES.

15:07.637 --> 15:09.940
CAN I HAVE A MINUTE
WITH MY SISTER?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.348
LOOK...

15:18.348 --> 15:20.020
I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE EMBARRASSED

15:20.020 --> 15:21.651
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
OUTSIDE THAT CLUB.

15:21.651 --> 15:23.153
ALL RIGHT? NOT AROUND ME.

15:23.153 --> 15:24.424
DON'T TRY TO COMMISERATE.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.626
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.328
SURE, I DO.
I-I'VE BEEN THROUGH

15:28.328 --> 15:30.330
A ROUGH PATCH OF MY OWN
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.332
HEY, YOU--YOU'RE GONNA BE

15:32.332 --> 15:34.234
AT OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY
LATER, RIGHT?

15:34.234 --> 15:37.107
SORRY. I CAN'T BE
AROUND MOM RIGHT NOW.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.438
AND I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.640
OR YOU WOULDN'T
BE MOVING TO FRANCE.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.572
BUT GOOD LUCK TONIGHT.

15:44.414 --> 15:48.148
AND THIS YEAR,
TRY NOT TO SHOOT ANYONE.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.150
(huffs)

15:52.382 --> 15:55.155
(knock on door)

15:55.155 --> 15:59.089
HELLO, ALISON.

15:59.089 --> 16:00.590
WERE YOU EXPECTING
YOUR HUSBAND...

16:00.590 --> 16:02.032
OR MINE?

16:03.633 --> 16:05.735
I UNDERSTAND YOU TWO
HAVE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER.

16:05.735 --> 16:07.267
MM.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.399
ARE YOU TRYING TO ENSURE
THAT YOU STAY

16:09.399 --> 16:10.670
IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.642
REGARDLESS
OF THE OUTCOME?

16:12.642 --> 16:14.744
NO, VICTORIA.
YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD.

16:14.744 --> 16:16.606
ALL I WANT
IS TO MOVE OUT OF IT.

16:16.606 --> 16:19.279
OUT?

16:19.279 --> 16:20.650
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN YOUR HUSBAND,

16:20.650 --> 16:23.383
ONLY MY OWN.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.386
WHEN CONRAD ENTERED THE RACE

16:26.386 --> 16:28.988
AS THE ONLY VIABLE CHALLENGER
TO MY HUSBAND'S OFFICE,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.221
I ASKED FOR A MEETING.

16:31.221 --> 16:34.394
AND JUST LIKE THAT, HIS POLL
NUMBERS MAGICALLY BEGAN TO RISE.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.597
AND MY HUSBAND'S
BEGAN TO FALL.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.729
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU'VE
BEEN SABOTAGING HIS CAMPAIGN?

16:39.729 --> 16:41.101
(chuckles)

16:42.732 --> 16:45.275
I'M FEEDING CONRAD
INFORMATION.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.408
LEAKING STRATEGIES,

16:48.408 --> 16:51.711
MY HUSBAND'S ATTACK ADS
BEFORE THEY AIR--

16:51.711 --> 16:54.784
ANYTHING TO GIVE CONRAD
AN EDGE.

16:55.785 --> 16:57.687
NOW WHAT COULD THIS MAN
HAVE POSSIBLY DONE

16:57.687 --> 17:01.091
TO DRIVE YOU TO DESTROY
A 30-YEAR CAREER IN POLITICS?

17:03.223 --> 17:06.296
MARK HAS A DEGENERATIVE
HEART CONDITION.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.400
HIS PRIVATE DOCTOR SAYS,

17:10.400 --> 17:14.164
WELL, HE WON'T SURVIVE
ANOTHER TERM AS GOVERNOR.

17:14.164 --> 17:17.367
MAYBE NOT EVEN SURVIVE
THE YEAR.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.069
WELL,
WHY COLLUDE WITH CONRAD?

17:20.069 --> 17:21.771
WHY NOT GO STRAIGHT
TO THE PRESS?

17:24.042 --> 17:26.746
NO, MARK WOULD NEVER
FORGIVE ME.

17:29.819 --> 17:31.621
LIVING THE LIFE
MARK LEADS--

17:31.621 --> 17:33.823
ENDLESS NIGHTS
AT THE OFFICE,

17:33.823 --> 17:36.256
GONE WEEKS AT A TIME--

17:36.256 --> 17:39.429
EVERY TIME I SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIM,

17:39.429 --> 17:44.594
I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT'LL BE
FOR THE LAST TIME.

17:44.594 --> 17:47.667
IT SOUNDS EXCRUCIATING.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.600
PLEASE...
LISTEN TO ME.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.702
IF CONRAD WINS,
IF YOU LOVE HIM,

17:52.702 --> 17:55.345
LIMIT HIM TO ONE TERM.

17:55.345 --> 17:58.708
THIS JOB IS
A PRACTICAL DEATH SENTENCE.

18:04.614 --> 18:07.317
(clears throat)
SLIGHTLY UNSETTLING--

18:07.317 --> 18:09.789
A FRESHLY FIRED
GRAYSON EMPLOYEE

18:09.789 --> 18:11.691
LURKING THE HALLS
OF A SUBSIDIARY.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.693
TRUST ME, IF I COULD BE
ANYWHERE ELSE, I WOULD BE.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.265
MM.
 I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.466
FRET NOT.

18:16.466 --> 18:19.169
AFTER THE REQUISITE
RUBBER STAMPS,

18:19.169 --> 18:21.401
NOLCORP CAN REMOVE
THE GRAYSON NOOSE,

18:21.401 --> 18:23.273
AND I CAN RESUME HIRING.

18:23.273 --> 18:24.874
YOU COULD BE MY BODYGUARD

18:24.874 --> 18:28.208
AND... I COULD BE
YOUR WHITNEY.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.609
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A JOB, NOLAN.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.281
THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.543
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOMETHING TO DO

18:33.543 --> 18:36.686
WHILE EMILY FINISHES
HER END GAME.

18:36.686 --> 18:39.249
THERE IS NO END GAME
FOR EMILY.

18:42.492 --> 18:44.254
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:44.254 --> 18:48.298
ALL THESE YEARS OF TRAINING,
TRYING TO FOCUS MY ANGER...

18:48.298 --> 18:50.230
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN I AVENGED
MY FATHER AND SISTER

18:50.230 --> 18:52.562
THAT I'D GET SOME KIND OF...

18:52.562 --> 18:56.306
PEACE OR... CLOSURE,
WHATEVER THAT IS.

18:56.306 --> 18:58.308
WELL, YOU MUST HAVE FELT
SOMETHING

18:58.308 --> 18:59.909
WHEN YOU KILLED TRASK.

19:01.411 --> 19:03.513
I FELT EMPTY.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.247
WAIT.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.518
ARE YOU SAYING

19:08.518 --> 19:12.682
YOU WANT EMILY TO JUST
GIVE UP HER MISSION?

19:12.682 --> 19:14.684
BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT TOLD ME,

19:14.684 --> 19:18.228
TAKE REVENGE AWAY FROM EMILY,
AND WE WILL LOSE HER FOREVER.

19:18.228 --> 19:19.789
BUT I KNOW BETTER NOW.

19:19.789 --> 19:21.791
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
HER FATHER KNEW ALL ALONG

19:21.791 --> 19:24.634

21:42.572 --> 21:47.407
CARRION CAN'T OPERATE
WITHOUT MY MAGIC TOUCH,

21:47.407 --> 21:49.409
WHICH MEANS EITHER YOU
GET ME OUT OF HERE

21:49.409 --> 21:50.540
OR THEY WILL.

22:27.076 --> 22:29.749
HE'S MORE CONCERNED

28:48.157 --> 28:51.200
BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

28:58.307 --> 29:01.140
(waves lapping)
 HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

29:01.140 --> 29:03.843
BY EXPOSING AIDEN,
YOU'VE PUT BOTH OF US AT RISK.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.315
THE BOY HAS PUT YOU
AT RISK.

29:06.315 --> 29:09.879
CARELESS, UNDISCIPLINED...

29:09.879 --> 29:12.121
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE LET HIM COME TO YOU.

29:12.121 --> 29:14.283
BUT YOU DID LET HIM COME.

29:14.283 --> 29:17.156
AND NOW EVERYTHING THAT I'VE
BEEN WORKING FOR IS IN DANGER.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.329
ONLY IF YOU'RE TOO WEAK TO DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

29:20.329 --> 29:23.292
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHAT YOUR ENEMIES HAVE STOLEN?

29:23.292 --> 29:25.394
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.
YOU KNOW THAT.

29:25.394 --> 29:27.236
THEN REMEMBER THIS--

29:27.236 --> 29:30.339
THE PATH YOU WALK
IS FOR YOU...

29:30.339 --> 29:32.201
ALONE.

29:33.202 --> 29:35.174
EVEN NOW

29:35.174 --> 29:38.978
THOSE WHO DESTROYED
YOUR FATHER...

29:38.978 --> 29:41.210
ARE PLANNING
A SECOND STRIKE.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.282
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO?

29:43.282 --> 29:46.455
WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO.

29:48.057 --> 29:51.490
CREATE FEAR, CHAOS...

29:51.490 --> 29:54.063
PROFIT.

29:54.063 --> 29:56.365
AND YOU'RE HERE TO STOP THEM,
AREN'T YOU?

29:56.365 --> 29:59.268
TAKEDA,
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

29:59.268 --> 30:01.030
LET ME HELP YOU.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.331
LET AIDEN HELP.

30:05.134 --> 30:06.535
NO.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.980
THIS PATH IS MINE ALONE.

30:30.159 --> 30:33.432
(indistinct conversations)

30:33.432 --> 30:35.364
SO IT'S TRUE?

30:37.166 --> 30:40.109
YOU'RE REALLY
GONNA MARRY DANIEL?

30:40.109 --> 30:43.112
(exhales)

30:43.112 --> 30:44.473
I AM.

30:44.473 --> 30:47.546
WHAT'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME AROUND?

30:48.617 --> 30:50.279
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:50.279 --> 30:52.221
I MEAN, LAST TIME YOU WERE
WILLING TO BREAK IT OFF

30:52.221 --> 30:54.023
OVER ONE KISS.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.357
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
DIDN'T TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

31:00.159 --> 31:03.092
I TRIED TO TELL YOU,
JACK.

31:04.393 --> 31:08.337
BUT THEN AMANDA WAS THERE,
AND SHE WAS PREGNANT...

31:08.337 --> 31:10.169
AND SUDDENLY, YOU HAD

31:10.169 --> 31:12.972
THIS WHOLE NEW LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.303
NOT ANYMORE.

31:20.609 --> 31:22.952
BE CAREFUL OF VICTORIA,
JACK.

31:22.952 --> 31:24.613
SHE MANIPULATES
WHENEVER IT SERVES HER,

31:24.613 --> 31:26.885
AND SHE DOESN'T DO
ANYTHING FREELY.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.487
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW THAT?

31:28.487 --> 31:30.889
I WAS MARRIED TO AMANDA.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.322
AND YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE HER BEST FRIEND.

31:33.322 --> 31:35.424
HOW COULD YOU AGREE
TO MARRY INTO A FAMILY

31:35.424 --> 31:38.367
THAT WE BOTH KNOW
RUINED HER LIFE?

31:38.367 --> 31:42.571
I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.

31:42.571 --> 31:45.004
AND SOMEDAY, I WILL.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.376
(chuckles)

31:47.376 --> 31:50.940
EMILY... I AM SO TIRED

31:50.940 --> 31:54.583
OF ALL THE SECRETS
AND THE HALF-TRUTHS.

31:54.583 --> 31:57.586
IT'S ALWAYS "SOMEDAY"
WITH YOU.

31:59.488 --> 32:01.590
YOU SHOULD GO BE
WITH YOUR NEW FAMILY.

32:08.257 --> 32:11.560
(indistinct conversations
continue)

32:17.166 --> 32:18.937
(door squeaks)

32:20.639 --> 32:22.711
I DIDN'T KNOW JACK
WAS ON THE GUEST LIST.

32:22.711 --> 32:24.643
HE WASN'T.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.645
GOD, THIS IS SUCH A MESS.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.547
TELL ME WHAT I MISSED.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.680
TAKEDA TOLD DANIEL
ABOUT AIDEN'S FATHER.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.552
YEESH. BAD TEACHER.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.054
HE CLAIMS THAT

32:35.054 --> 32:37.586
THE INITIATIVE'S PLAN
IS IMMINENT.

32:37.586 --> 32:39.488
WELL, NOT AS LONG

32:39.488 --> 32:42.731
AS THE FALC0N'S COMPUTER
PRIVILEGES ARE SUSPENDED.

32:42.731 --> 32:46.965
CARRION CAN'T OPERATE
WITHOUT HER KEYSTROKES.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.569
AND I GOT THAT
STRAIGHT FROM THE BIRD'S MOUTH.

32:50.569 --> 32:51.700
YOU SAW HER?

32:51.700 --> 32:53.242
WELL, GET THIS--

32:53.242 --> 32:55.274
PATRICK CAME A-KNOCKIN'
IN THE EARLY '90s.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.606
VICTORIA PAID HIM
5 MILLION SMACKERS

32:57.606 --> 32:59.248
TO DISAPPEAR.

32:59.248 --> 33:02.411
SO EITHER HE'S GRATEFUL
FOR THE BUYOUT

33:02.411 --> 33:04.983
OR HE'S FURIOUS
FOR THE DOUBLE ABANDONMENT.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.255
WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND?

33:06.255 --> 33:08.657
WELL, THE FALC0N'S
DONE PARROTING

33:08.657 --> 33:11.220
UNTIL I SOLVE HER RIDDLE.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.222
SHE SAYS THE ANSWERS I WANT
LIE IN THE PLACE

33:13.222 --> 33:15.324
THAT SHE WAS BORN
IF NOT MADE.

33:15.324 --> 33:17.326
(chuckles)
SHE GREW UP IN JERSEY.

33:17.326 --> 33:19.568
I'VE SEARCHED EVERYTHING
FROM SINATRA TO SNOOKIE.

33:19.568 --> 33:21.270
NO LOVE.

33:21.270 --> 33:23.332
MM.

33:23.332 --> 33:24.673
HEY.

33:24.673 --> 33:26.635
HEY.
CHARLOTTE JUST CALLED.

33:26.635 --> 33:29.578
I GOTTA BAIL HER
OUT OF JAIL.
 JAIL?

33:29.578 --> 33:31.410
YEAH, SOME COP LOOKING
FOR HIS 15 MINUTES

33:31.410 --> 33:32.641
SNAGGED HER
AT A CLUB DOWNTOWN.

33:32.641 --> 33:34.343
I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT HIS PRICE IS.

33:34.343 --> 33:35.644
WELL, LET ME COME WITH YOU.

33:35.644 --> 33:37.516
NO, NO, I NEED YOU
TO HOLD DOWN THE FORT.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.518
I GOTTA GET HER HOME BEFORE
MY PARENTS CATCH WIND OF THIS.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.620
THE LAST THING SHE NEEDS

33:41.620 --> 33:43.192
IS A LECTURE FROM
THOSE TWO MODEL CITIZENS.

33:43.192 --> 33:44.353
(kisses)

33:44.353 --> 33:45.524
I'M SO SORRY. ALL RIGHT?

33:45.524 --> 33:46.655
I'M GONNA CALL YOU
FROM THE CAR.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.259

33:50.259 --> 33:52.661

SEEMS LIKE A DECENT GUY.

33:52.661 --> 33:56.105

I'M WITH AIDEN NOW.

33:56.105 --> 34:00.339

34:00.339 --> 34:04.213

WHO I'M FIGHTING FOR.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.318
WAIT. THAT'S IT.

34:09.318 --> 34:12.150
THAT--THAT IS THE ANSWER
TO THE RIDDLE.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.322
UH, I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU
WHEN I GET BACK.

34:14.322 --> 34:16.425
(door opens)

34:16.425 --> 34:19.828
(Declan) THEY WANT 3 GRAND
FOR CHARLOTTE'S BAIL.

34:19.828 --> 34:22.491
WE JUST NEED TO HIT
A FEW ATMs.

34:22.491 --> 34:24.533
MUST BE REAL NICE
HAVING ALL THAT CASH

34:24.533 --> 34:25.833
READY AND WAITING FOR YOU.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.565
IS THAT WHY CHARLOTTE
LIKES YOU?

34:27.565 --> 34:28.737
'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S NOT
YOUR PERSONALITY.
 (car alarm chirps)

34:28.737 --> 34:30.438
MAYBE BECAUSE
I'M THERE FOR HER

34:30.438 --> 34:31.800
WITHOUT BEING SUPER JUDGEY.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.303
RIGHT. 'CAUSE YOU'VE KNOWN HER
FOR WHAT, FIVE MINUTES?

34:34.303 --> 34:35.574
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HER

34:35.574 --> 34:37.176
OR ME,
FOR THAT MATTER.

34:37.176 --> 34:40.609
MY LOSS, I'M SURE.

34:40.609 --> 34:43.152

video game music playing)

34:43.152 --> 34:45.614

ON "STREET FIGHTER."

34:51.590 --> 34:52.690
GREAT.
WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE

34:52.690 --> 34:54.263

RUN OUT OF TIME TO USE IT.

34:54.263 --> 34:55.623
UH, YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

34:55.623 --> 34:57.166

34:57.166 --> 34:58.797

into the loop.

35:01.570 --> 35:03.502

NOVEMBER SURPRISE ON YOU.

WELL, I'VE OVERWRITTEN
THE FALC0N'S SECURITY BLOCK.

40:14.643 --> 40:18.086
NOW ALL I NEED IS
YOUR ADMIN CODE, MR. TREASURER.

40:18.086 --> 40:19.748
ASSUMING GRAYSON I.T.

40:19.748 --> 40:21.720
HASN'T PULLED YOU OFF
THE ACCOUNT YET.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.053
OKAY.
 (beep)

40:25.053 --> 40:27.055
DECISION TIME, MATE.

40:27.055 --> 40:28.597
YOU HIT "ENTER,"

40:28.597 --> 40:30.859
AND THAT BANK ACCOUNT
ZEROES OUT.

40:30.859 --> 40:33.031
AND THE GRAYSONS
ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING.
 MM.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.064
SO THIS IS WHY YOU WANTED
TO SOLVE THE FALC0N'S RIDDLE--

40:36.064 --> 40:38.006
TO BANKRUPT THE GRAYSONS.

40:38.006 --> 40:40.739
AIDEN, WE'RE NOT READY
FOR THIS.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.842
ON THE CONTRARY.
THERE'S NO MORE TIME TO LOSE.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.014
AIDEN, DON'T!
 (click)

40:46.014 --> 40:50.519
(panting)

40:56.755 --> 40:57.886
(man) THE RECENT REVELATION

40:57.886 --> 40:59.888
OF GOVERNOR STODDARD'S
 HEART CONDITION

40:59.888 --> 41:01.630
HAS SENT SHOCK WAVES
 THROUGHOUT THE STATE,

41:01.630 --> 41:03.692
AND WITH NEW YORKERS HEADED
 TO THE POLLS

41:03.692 --> 41:04.763
IN A MATTER OF DAYS,

41:04.763 --> 41:06.765
THE NEWS ALMOST ENSURES
 A VICTORY

41:06.765 --> 41:08.797
FOR CHALLENGER
 CONRAD GRAYSON...

41:08.797 --> 41:13.141
INCREDIBLE. TWO DAYS FROM NOW,
YOU'LL BE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

41:13.141 --> 41:14.943
...AS LIKELY VOTERS IN
 PRECINCTS ALL AROUND THE STATE

41:14.943 --> 41:17.175
SAY THAT THEIR...
 WELL, I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.778
(all toasting indistinctly,
glasses clink)

41:19.778 --> 41:22.611
(Nolan) IT--IT'S DONE.
THE GRAYSONS ARE BANKRUPT.

41:22.611 --> 41:24.112
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE DID THE MONEY GO?

41:24.112 --> 41:26.955
IN AN ACCOUNT SO SECRET,
NOT EVEN THE FALC0N CAN FIND IT.

41:26.955 --> 41:28.587
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T USE

41:28.587 --> 41:30.789
YOUR ADMINISTRATION CODE
TO GAIN ACCESS.

41:30.789 --> 41:32.791
(sighs) THE GRAYSONS
WILL KNOW IT WAS YOU.

41:32.791 --> 41:34.963
(ATM beeping)

41:34.963 --> 41:36.665
THAT MAKES $3,000.

41:36.665 --> 41:37.966
LET'S GO GET MY GIRL.

41:37.966 --> 41:40.799
SHE IS NOT YOUR GIRL,
REGINA.

41:43.832 --> 41:46.775
(clank, electricity powers off,
people murmuring)

41:46.775 --> 41:49.237
(clank, electricity powers off)

41:51.840 --> 41:54.843
(clank, electricity powers off,
people shouting indistinctly)

41:54.843 --> 41:57.846
(alarm buzzing)

41:59.618 --> 42:00.919
(electricity crackling)

42:02.591 --> 42:03.752
(alarm ringing)
 (Declan) THE DOOR'S JAMMED.

42:03.752 --> 42:04.923
(siren wailing)
 WHAT THE HELL?

42:04.923 --> 42:06.154
IT'S A BLACKOUT.

42:06.154 --> 42:07.656
(car alarms wailing,
horns honking)

42:14.663 --> 42:16.865
(Emily) THE WHOLE CITY'S OUT.

42:16.865 --> 42:18.206
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

42:18.206 --> 42:20.739
MANHATTAN RUNS OFF SEVERAL
INDEPENDENT POWER GRIDS.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.741
(sirens wailing, horns honking)

42:22.741 --> 42:24.773
CARRION.

42:26.174 --> 42:28.316
IT'S STARTED.
