00:02.135 --> 00:03.363
I guess it was nobody.

00:03.403 --> 00:05.496
Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:05.538 --> 00:07.438
Ha ha! Ha ha!

00:07.474 --> 00:10.238
- Priceless, err.
- Spacecataz.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.504
It was them!

00:11.544 --> 00:14.274
Get them on the space feed
at once!

00:15.682 --> 00:17.650
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.946
Is this uh...

00:18.985 --> 00:22.318
Uh, who's this?
This is Mr. Brown...

00:22.355 --> 00:26.621
Sample of the, uh...

00:26.659 --> 00:29.127
I'm sorry,
you have the wrong number.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.754
Damn it!

00:30.797 --> 00:33.493
<i>My name is Shake-Zula</i>

00:33.533 --> 00:35.728
<i>The mike ruler,

00:35.769 --> 00:36.736
<i>You want to trip?</i>

00:36.770 --> 00:38.237
<i>I'll bring it to ya</i>

00:38.271 --> 00:39.932
<i>Frylock and I'm on top</i>

00:39.973 --> 00:41.031
<i>Rock you like a cop</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:42.234
<i>Meatwad, you're up next</i>

00:42.275 --> 00:43.742
<i>With your knock-knock</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:46.075
<i>Meatwad make the money, see?</i>

00:46.112 --> 00:48.546
<i>Meatwad get the honeys, G</i>

<i>Make the homeys say ho</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:12.732
<i>Number one in the hood, G</i>

01:12.772 --> 01:14.740
Do you even have it on?

01:14.774 --> 01:16.401
Have what on? What are you...

01:16.443 --> 01:18.968
I've been frantically text
messaging you for three hours!

01:19.012 --> 01:20.809
I thought you were ignoring me.

01:20.847 --> 01:24.681
But I guess
you don't have one of these.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.689
Huh? Huh?

01:30.723 --> 01:31.951
What is it?

01:31.991 --> 01:34.289
This happens to be an e-helmet.

01:34.327 --> 01:38.559
And it will change the way
you think and live forever.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.190
Yeah, and what about the pack?

01:40.233 --> 01:43.498
It allows the e-helmet
to change the way...

01:43.536 --> 01:45.936
you think and live forever.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.439
So, it's a battery.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.102
Yeah, a battery.
Try twelve batteries.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.667
And it's heavy as hell.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.839
But it is also cool as crap.
You ought to get one.

01:54.881 --> 01:55.939
Well, I tell you what.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.506
It seems
awfully convenient, Shake...

01:57.550 --> 01:59.814
but I think I'll just
stick with my cell phone.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.980
But you don't even know
what this does yet.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.387
OK, what does it do, Shake?
What could it possibly do?

02:04.424 --> 02:06.153
It's a cell phone.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.250
Wow.

02:07.293 --> 02:11.161
But it also text messages.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.494
Aha!

02:12.532 --> 02:13.863
Yeah, so does mine.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.391
Oh, yeah?
You think you're so great, huh?

02:16.436 --> 02:18.700
Well, check this out.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.831
Mine has an antenna!

02:20.874 --> 02:22.865
Where's... where's your antenna?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.706
Huh? What are you doing?

02:24.744 --> 02:26.905
I'm taking a picture
of your stupid ass.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.846
Is that really a camera?

02:28.882 --> 02:30.679
Oh, it's only
fourteen megapixels.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.015
But it works for what I need it
for, which is really nothing.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.383
This is not over.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.411
Man, where are y'all
getting all your money?

02:36.456 --> 02:39.584
Y'all, like, tell me.
You ain't got no job.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.560
Hey, everybody come on!
Outside!

02:41.594 --> 02:43.459
It's picture time!

02:43.496 --> 02:44.963
Hey, boy, I am Commander Meat...

02:44.998 --> 02:48.661
and you are in direct violation
of Space Treaty 109.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.191
Your ass is mine.

02:50.236 --> 02:54.400
Aha!
The treaties only go up to 103.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.874
Everyone from space knows that.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.377
Well, I mean, I know that.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.901
I was just
playing with you and...

02:59.946 --> 03:02.972
Those treaties
are very real and very serious.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.247
Is that... where did you...
That is not your e-helmet.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.151
Oh, well, yeah, it is.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.122
'Cause Frylock
says they're stupid...

03:10.156 --> 03:13.489
that's why I can wear it...
'cause I don't know no better.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.517
Why was I not
e- messaged about this?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.792
Because I told you that
to your face with my mouth.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.388
This is not how we talk now.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.798
Do you think I can hear
very well with this on?

03:21.834 --> 03:22.960
Do you?

03:24.103 --> 03:27.266
You check that out?
Did you read that?

03:27.307 --> 03:29.241
OMG!

03:29.275 --> 03:31.505
Those are
my electronic emotions.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.411
It allows me to conserve
my body's energy...

03:34.447 --> 03:36.472
for carrying all this stuff.

03:36.516 --> 03:37.744
Yeah, it looks like
it's gotten bigger.

03:37.784 --> 03:41.117
Oh, you must be referring
to the e-photo plug in.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.281
You pop it on your back,
and you go.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.915
These are travel-size, baby!

03:44.958 --> 03:47.017
- All that is a camera?
- Mostly.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.291
The bottom part here keeps me
intravenously hydrated.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.128
'Cause let me tell you,
this e-crap is heavy.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.292
Why don't you just go
to the hose...

03:54.334 --> 03:56.564
drink you some water...
like the dog you are?

03:56.603 --> 03:58.696
I'm not turning on
some analog faucet...

03:58.738 --> 04:00.797
to drink some barbaric water!

04:00.840 --> 04:03.866
The mouth is a primitive hole
that will soon be phased out.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.003
You better start taking
some pictures of those!

04:06.045 --> 04:08.673
Hey, can you phase it out now?
'Cause it's pissing me off.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.878
Can you read that? Or should
I try a different font?

04:11.918 --> 04:13.044
Uh, you spelled "hell" wrong.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.384
That's how it's spelled
in the e-world.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.752
All right,
now put on your e-helmet.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.950
I'm gonna forward you
a very funny story...

04:18.992 --> 04:20.152
about a duck in a bar.

04:20.192 --> 04:21.820
It's not mine anymore.
I gave it to Meatwad.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.055
- No!
- Yes!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.495
It's the only other helmet
it'll talk to.

04:24.530 --> 04:27.795
It's too advanced to be
compatible with anything else!

04:27.834 --> 04:30.302
Uh, are we gonna send me
that funny story now?

04:30.336 --> 04:33.499
I need me some new material...
for my nightclub act.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.336
Well, I'll just tell you
in person...

04:35.375 --> 04:37.809
as I jam that helmet
right into your brain!

04:37.844 --> 04:39.368
No!

04:39.412 --> 04:41.607
- I mean...
- Come on!

04:41.648 --> 04:42.740
Let's go! Come on!

04:42.782 --> 04:45.512
- Get over...
- Come get you some!

04:47.120 --> 04:48.815
What's wrong? You scared?

04:48.855 --> 04:50.049
Tell him to come over here,
please.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.454
Why don't you
just e-message him?

04:51.491 --> 04:53.459
He's not in my contact list.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.825
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:55.862 --> 04:58.524
Come on, man, y'all know
that... is funny.

04:58.564 --> 05:02.022
Frylock, would you like to see
some of the messages...

05:02.068 --> 05:04.696
your little meat friend
has been sending me?

05:04.737 --> 05:06.466
Oh, Meatwad doesn't have
the helmet anymore.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.339
Spoiler alert.
It involves a pig.

05:09.375 --> 05:10.933
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.842
Come get the bacon,
you know what I mean?

05:12.879 --> 05:14.210
Ha ha ha ha.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.045
It's sad that she's gotta wear
that thong made out of corn...

05:17.083 --> 05:20.746
'cause in every other way
they seem like they're in love.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.015
Oh, wait.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.615
No way! Monkey! Awesome!

05:24.657 --> 05:27.490
Look at this!
A monkey drinking its own urine.

05:27.527 --> 05:31.896
LOL, IMHO, colon, parentheses.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.660
- You hear this?
- Not anymore.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.292
What the hell's that thing?

05:35.335 --> 05:38.395
Oh, it's just an MP3 player.
Holds 40,000 songs.

05:38.438 --> 05:41.635
...you. Hand-truck me up.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.073
This is so weird.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.009
I think I'm actually done
being horny.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.502
Oh, wait. No, we're not.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.311
No, we are not.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.648
Yeah. Oh, yeah!

05:52.685 --> 05:55.381
Yo, Carlos! Come outside, baby.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.854
- Don't come in here!
- Come on!

05:56.889 --> 05:58.652
Why don't you just
text message him?

05:58.691 --> 06:00.784
Why don't you just text shut up?

06:00.827 --> 06:01.919
Carlos!

06:01.961 --> 06:05.089
Hey, hey. You got
a big old piano on your back.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.429
- It's an e-iano.
- What the hell's that?

06:07.467 --> 06:10.061
It takes your MP3s
that you download...

06:10.103 --> 06:14.631
live off the internet and
transforms them into this song.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.369
Yeah, but will it do
the ultimate song...

06:16.409 --> 06:18.673
Boston's More Than a Feeling?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.202
Yeah, it'll do anything
and turn it into this song.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.874
- You're serious?
- Here, I got you one.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.041
Freakin' awesome!

06:24.083 --> 06:25.573
Do you like to do the treadmill?

06:25.618 --> 06:26.915
Exercise is for women.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.751
Now you can.
The concert's in your head.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.984
Yo, Shake, I ain't want
to say nothing, man...

06:32.024 --> 06:34.549
but you look like
a mother... idiot.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.061
Ha ha ha!

06:36.095 --> 06:38.655
You know,
this is cool and all...

06:38.698 --> 06:40.495
but I'm kind of getting
a bad headache.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.830
Yeah, I know what you mean, man.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.631
And I don't know
if it's the song...

06:43.669 --> 06:47.196
or if it's the heavy magnets
that were inserted into my neck.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.606
Here's something that must
be attached to your head.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.576
I just may. What is it?

06:51.611 --> 06:53.340
Well, it's an e-booger.

06:53.379 --> 06:55.973
See, it allows
booger transmission...

06:56.015 --> 06:57.141
to the snot network.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.673
- Wait! No!
- And I wiped it on you!

06:58.718 --> 06:59.844
Wipe it off!

06:59.886 --> 07:02.252
Great, that's gonna harden now.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.916
- Carl, little help?
- Oh, yes!

07:04.957 --> 07:07.858
You've been
a bad, bad... chicken.

07:07.894 --> 07:10.021
Hey, will you put
that damn farm porn away...

07:10.062 --> 07:11.393
for just two seconds?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.830
No. Check out this link.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.425
It's funny,
but it's also kind of hot.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.869
Will you shut that...
ragtime music off!

07:18.905 --> 07:20.372
This is like I live
at Shakey's pizza!

07:20.406 --> 07:21.498
Well, I like it.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.839
And turning it off
is simply not an option.

07:23.876 --> 07:25.571
It does not have an off switch.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.737
- Yeah, I know.
- Oh, yeah!

07:26.779 --> 07:28.644
So, I went ahead
and ordered these.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.342
Ooh! So, what are they?

07:30.383 --> 07:32.283
This is the e-iano silencer.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.580
- Oh!
- Thank God!

07:33.619 --> 07:35.849
Hey, hook up those e-toms
while you're back there, eh?

07:35.888 --> 07:38.083
- E-toms?
- Plug and play!

07:38.124 --> 07:42.823
Yeah! See, it drowns out
the sound of the e-iano.

07:42.862 --> 07:43.851
Hey, Carl!

07:43.896 --> 07:46.956
Yeah, how do you like
those e-toms, huh?

07:49.268 --> 07:50.462
He's dead to the world.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.971
He's down on the farm,
if you know what I mean.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.905
Now wheel me inside.
I gotta pee!

07:54.941 --> 07:56.408
Aw, hell no! No! No, Shake.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.069
You're not coming
in the house with that.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.873
Well, I'm not coming
into the house...

07:59.912 --> 08:01.937
but it ain't 'cause of
that reason you said!

08:01.981 --> 08:04.245
Yeah, 'cause your stupid ass
is sinking into the dirt.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.683
Well, that's what you think
'cause you see that.

08:06.719 --> 08:07.947
Yeah, I do!

08:07.987 --> 08:10.478
Oh, why don't you see
if you can e-mail your pee!

08:10.523 --> 08:12.753
I will!
They're beta testing that!

08:14.560 --> 08:18.997
I sure hope that new upgrade
comes in before it rains.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.555
Carl, can you move?

08:20.600 --> 08:21.567
- Oh, yeah?
- Good.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.502
- Can you drag me insi...
- Touch the horse now.

08:24.537 --> 08:27.836
Oh, for God's sake.
Talk to me, not to candy!

08:27.874 --> 08:31.002
Look, if it rains,
we could die out here.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.806
And those EMTs
ain't gonna want to be...

08:32.845 --> 08:35.245
peeling
your filthy underwear off.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.407
That's... that's fine.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.144
Just put... put the horse
on the other end there.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.208
OK, just me.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.153

Hey, what are you doing?

08:59.605 --> 09:02.005

- That could be cool.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.736
Hey, what's that?
Is that my package?

09:03.776 --> 09:05.607
Ha. It's my package.

09:05.645 --> 09:06.703
No, it's not. It's mine.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.145
I'm allowed to order a package.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.841
OK, fine, it's your package.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.510
So, what did you get
in your package that's not mine?

09:12.552 --> 09:13.917
I don't know. Let's see.

09:13.953 --> 09:17.286
- Bees, boy! Bees!
- No! Whoo! Oh!

09:17.323 --> 09:19.553
Carl, no, help me!
We got bees here!

09:19.592 --> 09:21.719
Bees? Did you get
the link I sent you...

09:21.761 --> 09:23.558
about the woman
having sex with a bee?

09:23.596 --> 09:26.087
Would you shut up? Thank God!

09:26.132 --> 09:27.929
I couldn't be happier
to see you.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.867
All right, come over here, boys.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.239
Great! Now, run inside the house
before it rains. Hurry up.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.467
Hey, what's going on?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.634
I don't know,
I can't see back here.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.303
What y'all doing? Y'all playing?

09:38.344 --> 09:41.677
Look, we are advancing the world
through technology.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.182
'Cause it looks like
them old boys is...

09:44.216 --> 09:45.774
them two is in heat!

09:45.818 --> 09:47.786
Meatwad, come here. That's not
appropriate for you to see.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.617
Would someone tell me
what's going on back here?

09:49.655 --> 09:51.122
They're making babies out here.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.852
Well, obviously
they don't know any better.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.554
That's why we need
the intelligence helmets...

09:55.595 --> 09:56.960
to give them reason.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.124
Frylock, order the intelligent
helmet immediately.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.155
Use standard deliver.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.100
No, same...
it's gotta be same day.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.599
Uh, is Carl OK?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.302
Someone just please
shut off all the sex.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.810
I'm starting to chafe here.

10:11.844 --> 10:12.970
Uh, sorry about this, Shake...

10:13.012 --> 10:14.377
but we could only afford
one of these...

10:14.413 --> 10:16.404
and it's really not
the high-end model.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.916
So, what are we
talking about here?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.747
Shut up. Now, let him talk.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.753
Well, it does have
human intelligence.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.879
- Good.
- All right, cool!

10:22.922 --> 10:25.720
- Keep talking.
- But only of a four-year-old.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.749
- Aw, crap!
- You know what? That's enough.

10:27.793 --> 10:28.885
They know pain.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.089
And a four-year-old
would definitely run from this.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.724
- Turn it on!
- Please, for the love of God!

10:33.766 --> 10:35.063
OK, here we go.

10:35.101 --> 10:38.161
Mommy, it's tingling.
I don't understand it.

10:39.505 --> 10:40.938
Oh, look, it's working.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.736
No means no. I telling on you.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.505
Oh, I feel like
I need to call my parents.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.239
It's a beautiful thing...
intelligence.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.543
The control and restraint shown.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.049
- A pool! Oh, boy!
- No! Please, no!

10:51.083 --> 10:52.710
- Mommy, I go swimming.
- No, Mommy says no!

10:52.752 --> 10:55.721
- Look, Mommy, I go...
- Are you kidding? Aah!

10:55.755 --> 10:57.723
Let her go!
She's too young for you!

10:57.757 --> 10:58.917
Aagh!

11:02.228 --> 11:07.063
Well, really, the moral is
that technology and...

11:07.099 --> 11:10.500
that nice yellow padded chair
in the living room is mine.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.561
That's mine from now on.
I call it.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.698

11:14.740 --> 11:16.571
<i>Dan-Dancing is forbidden</i>

11:18.044 --> 11:20.035
