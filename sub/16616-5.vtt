00:01.460 --> 00:04.755
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:08.258
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:11.762
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.056
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:16.975
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.106
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:24.942
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:28.195
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.038
Peter, I need you
to take Chris and Meg to school.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.290
Today's the day I finally kill
that squirrel

00:40.374 --> 00:42.042
that's been eating our tomatoes.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.546
Try to get like eight of them this time,
I wanna make bruschetta.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.631
Oh, can't the kids just walk?

00:47.714 --> 00:50.509
You know I like to watch
two full movies before I go to work.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.345
No, Peter, they can't walk.
It's three miles.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.389
Fine, I'll take 'em.

00:55.472 --> 00:56.974
But you better keep those goggles

00:57.057 --> 00:59.518
'cause I'm gonna put them
to good use tonight.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.649
Once the floor is full of saw dust,
we can eat peanuts in here.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.699
Dad, are you sure it's okay
that we took Brian's car?

01:13.782 --> 01:14.783
Yeah, it's his own fault.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.493
He's the one who keeps his key
in the visor

01:16.577 --> 01:18.203
like a carefree hillbilly.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.498
Okay, everybody out. I don't want
the cool kids to know I'm your dad.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.672
Hey, Chris, guess who I just scored
as my date to the homecoming dance?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.674
Vice Principal McGuire.

01:30.757 --> 01:33.343
- Really?
- Yeah, her husband just died of ALS.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.512
So, she is ready to get at it.

01:35.596 --> 01:39.433
- Hey there, strong guy.
- Not now, Brenda.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.104
She says I have the body of
a 50-year-old before it gets ALS.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.355
So, who you gonna go with?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.774
I was thinking of asking Cara Morris.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.819
Why don't you ask her now?
Her locker's right over there.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.863
Um, yeah, okay.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.699
Hi, Cara.

01:55.782 --> 01:59.661
I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go
to the homecoming dance with me.

01:59.745 --> 02:03.582
Oh, hi, Robot from <i>Big Hero 6.</i>
No, but thank you.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.461
His name is Baymax, you gorgeous moron!

02:12.466 --> 02:16.845
All right, red light. Time to text and
shave and whittle and floss.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.848
Thanks for getting here so quickly.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.850
- What?
- I'm sorry, you're in a Prius.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.602
I just assumed you're my Uber.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.480
I don't know what that is
on account of being dull.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.234
Uber. It's like a cab except it feels like
a game 'cause it's from your phone.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.360
Anyway, I'm late for a meeting.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.237
Can I just give you 20 bucks
to drop me off?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.864
Wow, 20 bucks
just to drive you across town?

02:36.240 --> 02:39.409
Maybe I should be an Uber driver.
I mean, I could use the extra money.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.162
And it's gotta be an easier
than when I was delivering pizzas.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.748
All right, push, push, come on.
Come on, almost there.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.835
Almost there, just one more push.
Here it is.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.921
Oh, it's half Hawaiian.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.383
- I believe that's ours.
- You poor fool.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.600
- Hey, Stewie.
- What's up, big guy?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.353
None of the girls in school
want to go to homecoming with me.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.272
Probably 'cause everyone calls me names

03:08.355 --> 03:12.234
like big nips and fat nips
and big fat nips.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.445
Oh, don't listen to them, big fat nips,
they're just being haters.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.613
What's a hater?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.908
Oh, it's just something people say instead
of working to change their own flaws.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.828
Anyway, you just gotta do what
Taylor Swift does and <i>Shake It Off.</i>

03:23.036 --> 03:24.663
Who is Taylor Swift?

03:29.585 --> 03:30.586
Oh, my God.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.255
Am I about to introduce you
to Taylor Swift?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.174
What is she? A singer?

03:35.424 --> 03:38.051
She's much more
than a singer, Chris. She's...

03:38.510 --> 03:40.137
Uh, she's, she's the queen.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.390
A goddess, a gazelle
in a high waisted swimsuit.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.853
Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane
nor clowns nor a posse,

03:47.936 --> 03:49.980
- I'm not interested.
- I have an idea.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.691
You should ask Taylor Swift
to the homecoming dance.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.277
What? Why would she go
to a dance with me?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.113
I'm telling you, this is exactly
the kind of thing she would do.

03:58.197 --> 04:01.158
She's such a sweetheart.
Oh, I'm going limp.

04:01.783 --> 04:06.163
Oh, I'm just gonna lie here, moaning.
Thinking about Taylor Swift.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.250
Tay-Tay.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.752
How would I even ask her?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.087
It's easy.
You and I will just make a video

04:14.171 --> 04:16.381
about how sad you are and put it online.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.467
She's very interactive with all her fans.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.177
I guess it's worth a shot.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.347
Of course it is.
If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.140
Just like you did on New Year's eve.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.851
Three, two, one.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.103
Some animals give me boners.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.489
Hi, I'd like to be an Uber driver.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.783
Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.619
Don't I... Don't I need to fill out
a form?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.579
Oh, right, yeah, of course.

04:48.997 --> 04:52.334
"Name." Peter Griffin. "Criminal history."

04:52.835 --> 04:56.338
"This section is optional,"
I will skip this. And done.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.757
- Here you go.
- Yeah, none of this really matters.

04:58.841 --> 05:02.219
All I need to know is,
do you have a car, a phone, and a face?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.512
It's my dog's car.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.139
Oh, and I know you didn't ask,
but I am quick to anger.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.893
Okay, great. Now, get out there and
try to kiss as many ladies as you can.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.647
The record is 60 in a month.
You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.905
This is some good stuff, Chris.
I think it's ready to post.

06:03.071 --> 06:07.409
Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.
I made my own video and posted it.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.702
What? How could you do that?

06:08.911 --> 06:11.371
Stewie, I didn't wanna do
all that fancy stuff.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.791
So, I just did a video of me
speaking from the heart.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.585
You know, telling her
how much it would mean

06:16.668 --> 06:19.671
if a girl like her went
to homecoming with a guy like me.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.633
I couldn't even stay awake
during that description.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.221
- Hey, she already posted a response.
- What?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.140
<i>Hey, Chris Griffin.</i>

06:30.224 --> 06:33.310
<i>I just saw your video</i>
<i>and I'd love to go to your dance with you.</i>

06:33.393 --> 06:37.606
<i>All right, I gotta go eat an ice cream</i>
<i>cone</i><i>'cause us stars are just like you.</i>

06:38.065 --> 06:40.442
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.779
Uh-oh. This means
I have an awkward phone call to make.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.658
What? No, it was stupid.
What two guys going to homecoming?

06:47.741 --> 06:50.035
I, I assumed it was a goof
this whole time.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.163
Take it out. I'm ugly and unlovable.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.424
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

07:04.508 --> 07:07.803
<i>pop star Taylor Swift is coming</i>
<i>to Quahog to attend a dance</i>

07:07.886 --> 07:09.847
<i>with local high schooler Chris Griffin.</i>

07:09.930 --> 07:11.223
<i>But first, we go to commercial</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:14.768
<i>while our sports reporter smiles</i>
<i>and spins a football for some reason.</i>

07:20.357 --> 07:22.192
Wow, Chris. I'm so excited.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.695
You actually have a date
with Taylor Swift.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.490
Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?
Can I wear grandpa's jacket now?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.244
I don't know why you always ask for that.
That's, that's not a thing in our family.

07:32.703 --> 07:36.623
Oh, Rupert. I can't believe Taylor Swift
is actually going to be at our house.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.042
I haven't been this excited
since I abused those caffeine pills

07:39.126 --> 07:41.044
to get ready for the big show.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.797
Everything will be fine
as long as I take one of these.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.300
Pills! You actually are taking drugs?

07:46.383 --> 07:49.386
- Stewie, give me those.
- I can't, Zack, I need them to sing.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.807
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>

07:54.558 --> 07:57.644
I'm so scared.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.818
Screech is going to
stab someone on Christmas.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.659
Oh, Chris,
you look so handsome in your tux.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.662
This must be how Meat Loaf looked
when he went to the prom.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.581
- Oh, that must be her.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.707
Ah!

08:23.337 --> 08:25.672
Hi, you must be Chris. I'm Taylor.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.091
- What's up?

08:28.175 --> 08:31.595
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Your video was so sweet

08:31.678 --> 08:33.764
and I can't wait to go to the dance
tonight.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.642
Me, too. Would you like to come in?

08:37.643 --> 08:41.104
Hi, Peter Griffin, leering dad.
Quick question, in <i>Shake It Off,</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:44.942
you invite us to get down
to, quote, "This sick beat."

08:45.025 --> 08:47.528
Yet the beat you then provide
is rather mild.

08:47.611 --> 08:50.155
My question is this. May I lick your legs?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.699
Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin.
I'm your biggest fan.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.078
I don't mean it like a psycho. I just...
I'm not, I'm not a psycho.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.704
Oh, you're a cutie.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.625
Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.
Now, you don't have to say anything.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.961
I'm just gonna slowly pull out
this tape measure

09:04.044 --> 09:06.129
and you indicate when I should stop.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.548
Okay, here I go.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.216
Still going.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.635
Still going.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.887
Oh, my God. You bitch, seriously?

09:14.638 --> 09:17.975
Taylor, this is my sister, Meg,
and our dog, Brian.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.226
Nice to meet you both.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.479
We're not all so impressed.
I've met Dan Aykroyd.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.524
I'm sorry, uh, which cast member
of <i>Hee Haw</i> are you?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.235
Will you be nice?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.404
Okay, well, we should probably go.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.949
It was so nice to meet you all
except for the girl and the dog.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.910
Sorry about my family.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.954
Don't apologize. They seem nice.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.999
Well, you wouldn't say that
if you ever saw us in the movies.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.628
All right, we got our popcorn from home,

09:46.712 --> 09:50.090
our soda from home,
a snacks from home, and <i>Braveheart.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:56.889
- Where ya headed?
- The airport.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.266
Great, just a couple of errands
and we'll get you there.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.033
That was one bitch of a class.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.493
- Anyways, what time's your flight?
- It's in 20 minutes.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.330
Oh, boy, I can't make it in 20 minutes.
I better call you a Lyft.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.374
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.293
I hope you like <i>The Offspring.</i>

10:26.752 --> 10:27.961
Let's go.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.100
- Oh, my God. Taylor Swift.
- She's here with him?

10:42.184 --> 10:45.437
You guys, Mr. Bule is taking
a door-open duke in the bathroom.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.232
I hope this isn't too boring for you.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.359
No, this is so cool.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.818
I always sing about high school

10:51.902 --> 10:53.737
but I've never actually seen
one in person.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.698
Would you like to dance?

10:56.782 --> 11:00.035
Sure, but you're gonna have to
stand back like five and a half feet.

11:01.453 --> 11:04.790
Cool, you dance like
an unattended fire hose.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.211
Wow, it's like your dance
tells a whole story.

11:09.294 --> 11:12.422
Right? You're the only one
who's ever gotten that.

11:12.506 --> 11:15.759
Usually people just shove a wallet
in my mouth and call 911.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.387
You know, Chris, I'm having a great time.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.514
You're so cool and down to earth.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.099
I like you, too, Taylor.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.435
I was scared meeting a celebrity,
but you're so nice and normal.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.688
I feel totally comfortable around you.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.399
Well, why don't you just kiss her,
Griffin?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.902
Sorry, I just smoked a joint
with the pickup truck kids.

11:40.158 --> 11:42.119
That was really fun, Chris.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.246
I hope you don't mind
I made the band pay me a royalty

11:44.329 --> 11:46.707
- for each of my songs they played.
- Of course not.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.751
And I hope you didn't mind I showed you
who every locker belongs to.

11:49.835 --> 11:53.338
No, I thought that was nice.
I've never had a locker.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.966
I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.886
- Can I finger you?
- Sure.

11:59.344 --> 12:03.473
"Hi, I'm Taylor Swift.
I'm famous but I'm really nice."

12:03.557 --> 12:06.518
Aw. That's one of the best fingerings
I've ever had.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.166
What are you working on there, Chris?

12:29.249 --> 12:33.420
Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor
of some of her favorite things.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.547
Here's flowers and crop tops

12:35.631 --> 12:38.342
and pictures of Kanye West
with his mouth shut.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.386
Wow, you two seem to have
a wonderful connection.

12:41.470 --> 12:45.474
We do, Mom. You know, she's the first girl
to ever really understand me.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.770
Uh, you guys, you might want to see
this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.897
Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.941
'Cause she's a fucking smoke show.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.199
<i>'Cause I know you're just</i>
<i>blubber</i><i>In a dress shirt</i>

13:04.952 --> 13:08.830
<i>He licked his armpit</i>
<i>Then ate all my dinner and dessert</i>

13:10.999 --> 13:14.211
<i>Chris Griffin is a pig in every way</i>

13:14.628 --> 13:16.255
<i>Oh, oh</i>

13:16.338 --> 13:19.091
<i>Blubber, blubber, blubber</i>
<i>Oh, oh, blubber, blubber</i>

13:19.174 --> 13:20.551
<i>Oh, oh</i>

13:23.720 --> 13:26.139
Oh, and some animals give him boners.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.147
What the hell? Why would she do this?

13:34.231 --> 13:35.858
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
what's that next video?

13:37.192 --> 13:38.902
Oh, Daughtry.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.029
I'm a mom, so I love this.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.748
Chris, what happened?

13:51.832 --> 13:53.959
I thought you said Taylor
had a good time the other night.

13:54.042 --> 13:58.338
We did. She even let me grab the part of
her body which on others would be a butt.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.592
Wow, look at these comments.
Everyone hates you, Chris.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.178
She's right.
Check it out, you're already a meme.

14:07.556 --> 14:11.268
Aw, man, Chris, this computer
is telling me that you done swifted it up.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.270
Why would she do something like this?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.522
Because this is what Taylor Swift does.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.900
She gets into relationships with guys,
sabotages them,

14:17.983 --> 14:19.651
and then writes angry songs about it.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.570
I just wish I could talk to her.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.823
Well, why can't we? She has a house
in Rhode Island. We could go today.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.285
Oh, my God. We can go today.
My schedule is wide-ass open.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.786
Well, we can't just show up there.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.582
Why not? We've done crazier things before.
Remember when we sent that tweet?

14:34.208 --> 14:35.375
All right, you ready?

14:39.338 --> 14:43.884
Freeze, we're the internet police.
You guys are going away for a long time.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.803
Hey, what are you in for?

14:46.887 --> 14:49.640
I said, "Caitlyn Jenner
wasn't brave and beautiful."

14:49.723 --> 14:51.934
Brian, there's some bad people in here.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.731
Hey, what's up?
I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.400
Okay, would you like the AC on
or the windows down?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.486
- How about both?

15:05.447 --> 15:08.367
- Pretty great, right?
- It is. It really is.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.997
Thank you, genius person.

15:14.081 --> 15:18.085
No problem. Hey, you ever go in
a hot tub when it's snowing outside?

15:18.377 --> 15:19.628
Uh, what?

15:25.884 --> 15:28.262
Miss Swift, your song writing team
is here.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.765
We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.
Hit it, Marty.

15:33.392 --> 15:35.727
<i>Lox and bagels</i>
<i>and bagels and lox</i>

15:35.811 --> 15:38.272
<i>I like being a girl</i>

15:38.897 --> 15:40.107
Okay, one thought.

15:40.190 --> 15:44.152
What if we change lox to boys
and bagels to problems?

15:44.236 --> 15:45.487
Oh, that's perfect.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.448
Like when you changed <i>Pickle it Good</i>
to <i>Shake It Off.</i>

15:48.532 --> 15:50.158
All right, we got our homework.

15:50.951 --> 15:54.121
- Hi, Taylor.
- Chris? What are you guys doing here?

15:54.204 --> 15:55.455
I wanted to talk to you.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.792
Your house is way nicer than
Anne Murray's. We broke in there, too.

15:59.168 --> 16:01.336
Taylor, why'd you write
that song about me?

16:01.420 --> 16:03.297
I thought we had a real connection.

16:03.380 --> 16:06.466
We do. I really like you, Chris. I just...

16:07.176 --> 16:09.178
I'm sorry. I always do this.

16:09.261 --> 16:12.014
I ruin relationships
with nice guys and John Mayer,

16:12.097 --> 16:14.892
just so I can write songs
about heartbreak and moving on.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.852
But don't you think that's unhealthy?

16:16.935 --> 16:20.063
You're never gonna find a real
relationship if you keep doing this.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.482
Listen, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,
Chris.

16:22.566 --> 16:23.901
Let me make it up to you.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.403
Why don't you guys all come
to my show tonight as my guests?

16:26.695 --> 16:29.656
Are you serious?
Backstage with Taylor Swift?

16:29.990 --> 16:32.910
That'll be even cooler than when I was in
that remake of <i>The Princess Bride</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:34.494
with Bill Cosby.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.706
Now, one of these has the iocane powder,

16:37.789 --> 16:41.919
you see, and one of them makes you go
sleepy-bye with your mouth open.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.260
- Hey, pal, where we heading again?
- Just go down this dark alley.

16:57.726 --> 16:58.769
What the hell's going on?

16:58.852 --> 17:01.563
This is what we do
to Uber drivers in this town.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.444
Stop, stop, please stop!

17:07.528 --> 17:10.322
The sound of your leather jackets
is excruciating.

17:10.405 --> 17:12.991
You can't just buy a phone
and become a cab driver.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.702
Please, I have two families.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.502
- Stay back.
- Where, where did you get that?

17:23.836 --> 17:25.587
Judd Hirsch himself.

17:25.671 --> 17:29.758
I was a boy. No more than 11 or 12,
was on the side of the road.

17:29.842 --> 17:31.385
Man with a hat pulled up next to me.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.679
Said I reminded of him
when he was my age.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.974
I was just a boy, husking corn,
didn't know what it meant.

17:37.057 --> 17:40.227
'Course we were all husking corn back
then, just to keep the lights on.

17:41.270 --> 17:44.565
And you burned my car while I was
telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.830
God, I hate everybody who's not backstage.

18:00.289 --> 18:04.001
This next song is a new one.
It's about my boyfriend, Chris.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.384
<i>I'm pretty and I'm rich</i>
<i>and I'm in love</i>

18:12.467 --> 18:13.844
<i>Me, Taylor</i>

18:14.469 --> 18:16.680
<i>I've met the guy that</i>
<i>I've been dreaming of</i>

18:16.763 --> 18:18.015
<i>Me, Taylor</i>

18:18.098 --> 18:19.600
Boo!

18:20.434 --> 18:21.560
Wow, they hate it.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.565
- This stinks.
- We like you when you're miserable.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.902
You guys, Mr. Bule is taking
a door-open duke in the bathroom.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.696
Why were they being so mean to you?

18:32.779 --> 18:36.116
Well, I guess they are just used to me
being sad and hurt by men.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.369
But I don't care if they like it, Chris.
I'm happy with you.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.371
I'm happy with you, too.

18:41.455 --> 18:45.209
But it doesn't seem like your fans
like this new happy Taylor.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.044
Are you willing to risk losing them

18:47.127 --> 18:50.297
and jeopardize your career
and your art just for us?

18:50.881 --> 18:52.341
I think I am.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.308
- Well, I don't know if I am.
- What? What are you saying?

19:03.143 --> 19:05.562
I'm saying that, Taylor Swift,

19:05.646 --> 19:10.234
you are a spoiled, ostrich-legged,
no-talent, big-footed freak.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.777
You pretend to relate to your fans

19:11.860 --> 19:14.404
but you make your bodyguards
carry your purse.

19:14.488 --> 19:18.617
All your songs sound the same.
And your cats aren't that cute.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.332
Thank you, Chris.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.755
This next song
is about my dumb ex-boyfriend

19:31.839 --> 19:34.424
who either mistreated me, cheated on me,

19:34.508 --> 19:37.344
or went to massage parlors
when I was out of town.

19:43.809 --> 19:46.144
Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.688
Yeah, I guess.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.190
Don't worry.
They'll be plenty of girls for you.

19:50.274 --> 19:53.026
No one will ever be close to as good
as her but we'll find you someone.

19:53.443 --> 19:56.488
What about like a motorcycle lady?
You know, like an old gal.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.782
Her grandchildren call her
by her first name.

19:58.866 --> 20:00.701
Now, let's get out of here.
I called us an Uber.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.872
How many tooths is not enough tooths?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.754
Well, kids, your father
may have gotten beat up,

20:12.838 --> 20:16.258
but Uber's still a great job
for anyone afraid to sell their blood.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.303
And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't
work out with you and Taylor Swift.

20:19.386 --> 20:23.348
I think we're all sorry about that, Brian.
But I'm afraid we're out of time.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.684
I would like to thank our guests
Taylor Swift,

20:25.767 --> 20:27.895
Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,

20:27.978 --> 20:30.647
Cleveland Brown
and his band of Brown Renown.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.941
Hey, we'll see you down
in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?

20:33.192 --> 20:35.485
Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.781
We apologize to the Greased-Up Deaf Guy,
didn't have time for him tonight.

20:39.865 --> 20:43.118
But let's see if we can get him back
next week when Amanda Peet will be here

20:43.202 --> 20:45.454
with standup Dom Irrera.
Good night, everybody.
