NARRATOR:
Previously:

00:03.586 --> 00:07.798
Vampires and werewolves used to roam
freely until a shaman put a curse on them.

00:07.966 --> 00:11.677
Werewolves can turn on a full moon
and vampires are weakened by the sun.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.304
The werewolf part
is sealed with a moonstone.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.765
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look alike?

00:16.933 --> 00:19.393
You're a doppelgänger.
The key to breaking the curse.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.311
You know my daughter Elena.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.981
- Getting easy being you.
- I don't want you here.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.859
We all want the same thing:
Klaus dead.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.112
The oldest vampire in the history of time
is coming after me?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.488
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.

00:32.656 --> 00:36.326
He believed if a witch could channel
enough power, it wouldn't need one.

00:36.494 --> 00:38.954
Like the power you get
from 100 dead witches.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.416
I'm a vampire.
I can't let you leave, not like this.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.543
- You...
- What did you do to my sister?

00:44.711 --> 00:47.296
Jenna keeps asking about Isobel.
Isobel is dead.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.426
ISOBEL:
Hi, you must be Jenna.

00:52.594 --> 00:55.971
- I'm Elena's mother.
- Isobel.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.353
Hello, Elena.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.188
It's nice to see you again.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.069
Again?

01:10.945 --> 01:13.655
So you're the woman
who's dating my husband.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.826
I need to speak to Elena.
May I come in?

01:17.994 --> 01:20.454
No, no. Don't. Don't invite her in.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.373
- I need to talk to you, Elena.
- No.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.464
You knew she was still alive?

01:32.258 --> 01:35.302
And Ric? John? Did they know?

01:35.470 --> 01:38.305
- I can explain everything, Jenna.
- No.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.765
No. Jenna, please.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.475
Jenna, please.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.726
Wait. Jenna.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.978
Jenna, please wait.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.732
Jenna, you have to talk to me.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.756
Isobel just showed up
at the front doorstep.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.093
- What's she doing here?
- That's what I'm gonna go find out.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.596
I don't think you should tell her
I'm here.

02:19.764 --> 02:20.848
What? Why?

02:21.015 --> 02:24.726
It's better if she and John not know
I stayed in town after I got out.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.105
You're the one in cahoots with them.
You made a deal with John.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.024
I did what I had to do
to get out of the tomb.

02:31.192 --> 02:33.819
Now I'm reconsidering my alliance.

02:34.904 --> 02:36.738
What do you know?

02:38.575 --> 02:42.452
I know that I want Klaus dead,
which puts me squarely on Team You.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.874
Besides, if you two ever need me
to swap places with Elena again...

02:47.041 --> 02:50.419
...the less people know
that I'm here, the better.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.505
Think about it, Stefan.
Come on. Be smart.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.760
Tell you what,
why don't you call Alaric...

02:58.928 --> 03:03.557
...and let him know that his wife just
showed up on his girlfriend's doorstep?

03:09.230 --> 03:10.814
Hey, is she up yet?

03:11.816 --> 03:13.317
She won't come out of her room.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.320
- What did you tell her?
- Nothing. She won't talk to me.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.655
- We're gonna have to fix this, Elena.
- Yeah.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.282
- Hey.
- Jenna.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.659
I don't want you here, Ric.
You need to go.

03:22.827 --> 03:26.163
Listen, I can't begin to imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.290
Rage and betrayal would cover it.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.791
Where are you going?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.710
I'm going to stay on campus.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.796
I have a thesis to write
and I don't wanna be in this house.

03:34.964 --> 03:38.926
Jenna, please, just stop. Let us explain
to you exactly what is going on.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.094
I need you to go
to the Lockwood's today.

Okay, but... Jenna, please just...

03:46.476 --> 03:50.020
I don't have it in me
to hear any more lies from you.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.484
- Jenna, just...
JOHN: Let her go.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.154
It's better that she's not here
with everything that's going on.

03:59.322 --> 04:03.951

with her from the beginning, this...

04:11.334 --> 04:13.252
Sorry, Elena.

You know this is your fault, right?

04:22.428 --> 04:23.887
Right.

04:29.894 --> 04:33.522
I can't find him anywhere. He's not at home,
he's not answering his phone.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.692
STEFAN: How could you let him go?
- My mom walked in, he just took off.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.360
[OVER PHONE]
I didn't know what to do.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.363
- Did your mom hear anything?
- No, she just thinks we're fighting.

04:41.531 --> 04:45.033
But he knows about me
and he was freaking out about Vicki.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.494
STEFAN:
All right, listen. You have to find him.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.663
Calm him down.
Compel him, if you have to.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.374
- Is he still on vervain?
- I slip it into his soda.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.002
I didn't get to last night,
it's out of his system.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.546
[OVER PHONE] He has a catering shift
at the Lockwood's today.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.631

MATT [ON MACHINE]:
You've reached Matt. Leave a message.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.769
This is bad. Between Isobel and Jenna
and now Matt...

05:12.937 --> 05:14.771
...this is "disaster" bad.
- Yeah.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.404
Elena, can you come downstairs, please?
I need to talk to you.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.905
I've nothing to say to you.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.451
Please. It's important.
You too, Stefan.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.215
I asked John for a do-over.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.011
You invited her in?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.055
She has information about Klaus.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.724
Please, just listen to her, okay?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.645
All right.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.189
What do you know?

05:57.357 --> 06:01.276
Since I was last here, I've been doing
everything possible to find Klaus.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.572
We knew our best chance was
to find him before he could find you.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.948
Best chance at what?

06:07.116 --> 06:08.283
Keeping Elena alive.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.912
You don't get to talk, okay?
Not after everything you've done.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.457
Were you able to find Klaus?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.876
No. Nobody knows where he is.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.921
But there are these rumors
that are flying around...

06:21.089 --> 06:22.547
...that a doppelgänger exists.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.258
Any vampire that wants
to get in favor with Klaus...

06:25.426 --> 06:27.219
...will be lining up to capture you.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.392
I'm not buying any of this.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.312
The last time that you were here,
you didn't give a damn about me.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.564
Now I'm supposed to believe
you wanna help?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.983
Isobel's been helping all along.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.655
Klaus has been obsessed
with finding Katherine for centuries.

06:46.823 --> 06:50.325
All it would take was one tomb vampire
to spread the word around...

06:50.493 --> 06:52.035
...that Katherine was alive...

06:52.203 --> 06:54.538
...and it would bring him here
to Mystic Falls...

06:54.705 --> 06:57.666
...where you were bound
to be discovered. So we killed them.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.752
- And almost killed Stefan and Damon.
- Yeah.

I have a safe house that I can take you to.
The deed is in your name.

No vampires can get in
without your permission.

Not even me.

Let me help you.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.060
You wanna help?

07:18.688 --> 07:21.022
Then get the hell out of my house.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.493
Yep, everybody's dead.

07:33.661 --> 07:36.913
We should pack up the Grimoires.
I spent years collecting them.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.665
I wanna make sure they're safe.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.418
We could just get another match
and cremate him.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.919
Don't be disrespectful.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.381
- Not to him.
- Fine. I'll bury him.

BONNIE: According to Luka's dad...

07:49.510 --> 07:53.763
...one of these contains a spell that will
harness the energy left when a witch dies.

were close.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.726
We weren't.

But when he gave me my powers back,
he gave me a message.

If I can find the spot in town where
the old Salem witches were burned...

08:05.610 --> 08:08.111
...I can harness their energy
to use when I need it.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.363
DAMON:
We'll put that on our list of things to do:

08:10.531 --> 08:12.824
Harness ancient dead-witch power.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.496
You know where
the witches were burned?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.873
Did I forget to mention that?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.793
Are we gonna have to read every one
of these till we find the spell?

I hear you've been busy.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.315
Yes, I have.

09:27.984 --> 09:32.654
I have been busy making a deal with Klaus
to save your life.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.162
Here.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.958
- A vintner I knew in Avignon.
- Hmm.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.253
Mm, he's tasty.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.591
So, what was with the surprise visit
to the Gilbert house, hmm?

09:52.758 --> 09:57.012
John told me Ric was dating Auntie Vanilla.
I got jealous.

09:57.179 --> 10:01.016
You've obviously got John
wrapped around your finger...

10:01.183 --> 10:03.351
...if he invited you in the house.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.520
He thinks
I'm helping him protect Elena...

10:05.688 --> 10:08.231
...so he's been very useful
in keeping me informed...

10:08.399 --> 10:10.358
...on everything that's been going on.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.569
So tell me what you know.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.739
You were right.
I couldn't get anywhere near Klaus.

10:16.198 --> 10:20.076
But I found my way to someone
in his trusted circle.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.998
One of his witches.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.000
Ugh. Klaus and his witches.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.919
He said that Klaus is willing
to grant you your freedom...

10:30.087 --> 10:32.714
...if we deliver the moonstone
and the doppelgänger.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.215
I can get the moonstone.

10:34.383 --> 10:38.386
You know, Katherine, you'll be betraying
your Salvatore boys again.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.057
I was more than willing
to play it their way if I had to...

10:42.224 --> 10:45.644
...but they're floundering.

10:45.811 --> 10:50.065
Their witch has lost her powers, they've
used their only weapon to kill Elijah.

10:50.232 --> 10:51.775
If I stick with them, I'm dead.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.319

STEFAN:
I don't trust a word she says...

11:03.537 --> 11:06.498
...but I think we'd be stupid
to ignore the warning.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.418
You should just stay here.
It's better for us to keep an eye on you.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.754
What, in the house
that any vampire can enter?

11:12.922 --> 11:15.507
- No, her house is safer.
- Well, then we'll stay there.

Is that the plan, neither of you
let me out of your sight?

11:18.636 --> 11:20.929
Let me know when you come up
with a better one.

Then one of you is gonna have
to come with me...

11:23.766 --> 11:26.059
...to the Lockwood luncheon.
- That'd be me.

Not me. I've witch stuff to attend to
with Bonnie.

Does that mean
that you're taking her to the...?

What is the plan
to get us out of this mess, hmm?

11:48.457 --> 11:50.333
I delivered you a moonstone...

11:50.501 --> 11:53.461
...a werewolf,
and a dagger to lure and kill Klaus.

11:53.629 --> 11:56.881
And right now,
all you have is a moonstone.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.758
- Or so you tell me.
- No, we have it.

11:59.468 --> 12:02.178
- Where is it?
- It's in a very safe place.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.889
I've been honest with you.
Time to return the favor.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.307
DAMON:
Let me be honest with you.

12:06.475 --> 12:10.854
Don't mistake the fact that we haven't
set you on fire in your sleep for trust.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.897
Fine.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.899
Be that way.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.990
The marshal hasn't been able
to figure out what caused the fire...

12:22.158 --> 12:24.200
...but he did find blood.

12:24.368 --> 12:27.245
No body, just blood.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.833
- You think vampires were involved?
- I assume the answer to that is always yes.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.420
- Hey.
- Mrs. Lockwood, have you seen Matt?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.839
I thought he was working
at today's luncheon.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.591
No, I haven't, honey, sorry.

12:40.342 --> 12:44.888
But if you see him, could you ask
if he's heard from Tyler?

12:45.055 --> 12:47.182
Yeah, of course.

12:47.349 --> 12:48.641
Still no word from him?

12:48.809 --> 12:52.395
No. The note he left said he needed time
to figure some things out.

32:52.095 --> 32:55.097
I'm still me. It's just...
I'm just a little bit...

32:55.264 --> 32:56.932
Don't, no.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.894
This is too much.
All of this is just too much.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.064
- I don't wanna know this.
- Tell me what I can do.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.901
Tell me what I can do.
I wanna help you.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.239
You can make me forget.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.074
You've done it to me before.

33:14.242 --> 33:18.245
- I don't... I don't think that's...
- Please make me forget, Caroline.

33:20.123 --> 33:24.126
I don't want to look at you
and see what I'm seeing right now.

33:24.293 --> 33:26.628
But maybe after a little while...

33:26.796 --> 33:29.089
Just make me forget, Caroline.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.093
Okay.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.806
Okay, Matt.

33:52.655 --> 33:53.905
That Isobel's?

33:57.160 --> 34:00.912
I never thought I would feel bad
about her being dead, and yet...

34:01.831 --> 34:03.457
She was your mother.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.170
Why did they let me go?

34:12.007 --> 34:15.844
Well, anything that John told Isobel,
we have to assume Klaus knows, right?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.972
He knows that you're not gonna
turn yourself into a vampire.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.183
He knows that you have us
keeping you safe.

34:21.350 --> 34:22.976
He knows I'm not gonna run.

34:24.312 --> 34:28.023
Which is why we need
to take some precautions.

34:28.815 --> 34:32.694
Because we got played. All of us.

34:33.154 --> 34:37.032
- What's this?
- The deed to our house. In Zach's name.

34:37.199 --> 34:40.202
As soon as you sign it,
it will be a new name.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.329
You're giving me your house?

34:42.496 --> 34:46.208
Isobel had the right idea with the
safe house, just stay here till it's over.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.335
That way you can control
who gets invited and who doesn't.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.339
Although I'll be super-pissed
if you lock me out.

35:00.890 --> 35:05.519
I swear, I have no idea
what she was gonna do. I'm sorry.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.397
I'm so, so sorry.

35:09.565 --> 35:12.192
Damon, let him go.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.196
He and I need to talk.

35:22.036 --> 35:25.247
- I told you to not worry about that.
- A warning.

35:25.414 --> 35:29.376
That's all you felt like telling me?
This is some kind of warning, Bonnie.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.504
If you use too much of your powers
at once, it will kill you.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.884
How much would it take
to kill an Original?

35:39.887 --> 35:44.558
- All of it.
- No. I'm not gonna let you do that.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.645
Jeremy, do you think
I was born with these powers...

35:48.813 --> 35:52.107
...so I could float feathers
and blow out candles?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.442
There's a reason I was called
to do this.

35:54.944 --> 35:59.364
No one's called to get themselves killed.
Elena's not gonna let you die for her.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.283
That's why you're not gonna tell her.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.785
Do you even understand
what you're saying now?

36:03.953 --> 36:08.165
It's not just for Elena, Jeremy.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.959
It's for you, it's for everyone.

36:11.669 --> 36:15.755
If I am the only one
who can put an end to this...

36:15.923 --> 36:18.425
...then it will be my decision.

36:18.593 --> 36:22.429
No one else's. Mine.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.828
I did it.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.123
I drank that vervain stuff...

36:51.459 --> 36:54.961
...I went over there
and I got her to tell me everything.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.798
Then I asked her to take it away.

37:00.218 --> 37:05.305
Thank you, Matt.
I know this isn't easy...

37:06.098 --> 37:08.975
...but I'm glad you told me
what happened last night.

37:11.187 --> 37:15.315
I want you to tell me
everything she said.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.154
I feel like she died.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.365
Oh, she did.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.830
I always knew
that she and Katherine were close...

37:30.998 --> 37:35.001
...but I never realized that Isobel and her
were working against me.

37:35.336 --> 37:39.673
Two of the world's most uncaring
and selfish vampires...

37:39.840 --> 37:41.841
...and yet they were genuinely friends.

37:42.009 --> 37:45.762
If that's what you thought of her,
why did you ever put your trust in her?

37:45.930 --> 37:51.393
Because I was there
when she gave birth to you, Elena.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.897
I saw how heartbroken she was
to give you up.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.862
And because she was the first girl
I ever loved.

38:03.531 --> 38:07.284
And when she said
she'd help keep you safe...

38:08.411 --> 38:10.370
...I believed her.

38:12.790 --> 38:18.295
At this point,
I will do whatever you want me to do.

38:21.048 --> 38:25.677
If you feel safer with me not around,
then I'll go.

38:41.193 --> 38:47.407
You screw everything up, John.
Everything you touch falls apart.

38:50.703 --> 38:53.580
But you're the only parent I have left.

38:57.251 --> 39:01.755
So maybe I can learn not to hate you.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.258
Okay.

39:11.265 --> 39:15.101
Hey, Bonnie said the spell worked.
She's locked and loaded.

39:15.269 --> 39:17.604
At least something went right today.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.106
Hmm.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.860
Katherine has no idea
that Bonnie got her powers back.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.362
DAMON:
Mm-mm.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.573
And Isobel had no idea...

39:28.741 --> 39:31.368
...what you and Jeremy
took Bonnie to do today.

39:33.287 --> 39:34.371
Uh-uh.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.331
We're the only ones who know.

39:37.124 --> 39:40.043
That literally makes Bonnie
our secret weapon.
