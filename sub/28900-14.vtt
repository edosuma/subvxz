00:07.420 --> 00:11.970
Our girl weekend
coincides with a sale.

00:11.970 --> 00:14.180
We're gonna get
our hair done,
our nails done,

00:14.180 --> 00:16.050

do the three B's.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.010

00:22.680 --> 00:26.270

an ecology project
this weekend.

I'm sorry.
You probably didn't hear me.
It's a sale.

You're just gonna bail
on the three B's?

I need is basketball.

There, there it is!
Right there. Right there.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.110
‐Okay, Nia. So...

10:19.110 --> 10:21.030
The compost feeds the soil.

10:21.030 --> 10:23.410
But the fertilizer
feeds the plants.

10:23.410 --> 10:25.790
So we have to come up
with the perfect mix of both.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.410
Keyword: Mix.

10:27.410 --> 10:29.620
(drill whirring loudly)

10:30.830 --> 10:31.630
Okay, okay.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.590
Hey, hey, you guys!
Your drill is disturbing
our drill.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.800
Huh? Sorry, we couldn't
hear you over the drill.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.140
Oh, no. It's okay, Nia.
I can read lips.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.140
I love you too, Raven.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.310
(whirring stops abruptly)

10:49.310 --> 10:51.230
You know what, Nia?
Actually, besides
reading her lips,

10:51.230 --> 10:52.860
I can also read her face.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.190
Yeah, the eyes,

10:54.190 --> 10:57.190
plus the nose,
carry the lips...
yeah...

10:57.190 --> 10:59.070
We should go.

11:03.780 --> 11:05.870
It takes Taylor two minutes

11:05.870 --> 11:08.450
to get from history class
to the cafeteria.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.210
That's not a lot of time.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.710
Unless you get him
in the blind spot
by the science lab.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.210
That's where
he's most vulnerable.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.220
Yes! See?

11:20.220 --> 11:22.090
That's what
I'm talking about, Elliot.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.260

11:23.260 --> 11:25.140
Yeah, Elliot.

You gotta actually
make the compost.

12:09.430 --> 12:12.730
Okay, yeah, but do we
have to do this in here?

12:12.730 --> 12:14.520
Well, everywhere else
was taken.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.570
Raven kicked us off the roof,
and the boys in the living room.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.360

12:22.860 --> 12:24.240

12:33.750 --> 12:34.750

12:35.630 --> 12:37.040
Whatever. Whatever.
This is great.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.210
Yeah, all we gotta do
is kick things up a notch.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.710

‐(nervously): Right...

12:49.260 --> 12:50.930

12:51.850 --> 12:53.390
Well, Aunt Chels,

12:53.390 --> 12:55.020
I think you're all caught up.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.820
Also this compost smell
is so overwhelming,

12:58.820 --> 13:00.280
it's making my eyes water.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.860
I know. It's emotional, Nia.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.990
Me too.

13:06.910 --> 13:08.570
