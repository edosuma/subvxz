WEBVTT

00:48.757 --> 00:52.010
Hey, waitress
Pour me another cup of coffee

00:52.094 --> 00:56.223
Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me out
Flyin' down the highway

00:57.140 --> 01:00.269
Lookin' for the mornin'

01:27.296 --> 01:29.798
Okay. Just hear me out, please.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.469
In the video, we wear leotards with
"Body by Bunny" silk screened across them,

01:34.553 --> 01:37.014
and at the end, we put up a card
on the screen that says,

01:37.097 --> 01:40.934
"To learn more, come to
Playa del Vista mall and take our class."

01:42.436 --> 01:44.188
-What do you think?
-You know what I think.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.772
I know what you said.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.109
What I think is I'm not turning my class
into a fucking home videotape

01:49.193 --> 01:50.444
is what I think.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.573
What about all the women out there
who'll love it?

01:54.656 --> 01:55.657
Who need it?

01:56.241 --> 01:58.619
They need it, but they can't get to it

01:58.702 --> 02:00.871
because of family obligations,
self-esteem.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.664
But if they could pop in a tape

02:02.748 --> 02:04.917
and just focus on
that one moment for themselves,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.877
their health, to feel powerful,

02:07.920 --> 02:09.838
we could make a real business out of that.

02:09.922 --> 02:10.756
I think.

02:11.757 --> 02:16.720
Hey, Bunny, let people pay one time
to take your class at home forever

02:16.803 --> 02:18.972
so they won't need you
in the flesh anymore.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.059
You know what I'm not gonna be doing?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.143
That!

02:27.397 --> 02:30.025
Doughnut? They're not that old.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.611
Does she really not see it?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.405
Or does she just really not like me?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.699
Or you just keep describing it in words.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.453
I mean, she's a super visual person
who does not like you.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.457
She needs to see it see it.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.376
That's how she puts shit together.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.754
Like this one time,
she just did not get what I was asking,

02:50.838 --> 02:53.090
and I ended up having to go
to the fucking library to take out...

02:53.173 --> 02:56.426
-So we need to shoot a sample...
-...what's it called?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.388
-...like a test run.
-Kama Sutra. And fuck yeah.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.139
We should shoot it at the beach.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.141
High sun, low tide.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.269
Plenty of flat light
diffused in that ocean spray.

03:05.352 --> 03:10.107
Health and beauty reminds everybody
how good they feel at the beach.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.526
We could do it without a permit
if we're quick.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.904
I know a sound dude from porn.
He went to NYU.

03:17.489 --> 03:18.615
When are we doing this?

03:18.699 --> 03:21.410
Tuesday's canvass
is pretty well spaced out.

03:21.493 --> 03:25.205
Wednesday's is a little tight,
but it's all Imperial Beach.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.874
Now Friday, we have the Methodists

03:26.957 --> 03:28.917
and the guy who used to
skipper the Greenpeace boats.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.627
Are all of these events potlucks?

03:33.213 --> 03:37.509
Wednesday's Rotary Club thing,
you're judging a baked cheese contest.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.554
So, no, not all of them.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.140
Why? What's wrong with potlucks?

03:43.223 --> 03:45.184
Well, I mean... I just--

03:45.267 --> 03:48.103
If I don't have a bite of every
single dish, no matter how full I am,

03:48.187 --> 03:50.439
I always seem to offend somebody
who's baked some--

03:50.522 --> 03:53.400
The wives just want the pretty lady
to tell them that they're good,

03:53.483 --> 03:55.152
so why is that hard?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.405
Well, I'm just not used to eating so much
in the middle of the day.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.449
-You gotta learn to pace yourself, hon.
-Yeah.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.368
Or we could just cherry pick the events

04:03.452 --> 04:05.621
where my being there
would actually mean something.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.873
I'm doing all of the work, Sheil.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.334
Do you think
I wouldn't rather eat hot cheese

04:10.417 --> 04:13.837
than get hammered
over regulatory land use reform?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.714
You know, the Sheila I knew at Berkeley
would have been excited

04:16.798 --> 04:19.510
-to get out there and spread the message.
-Yeah.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.804
Not look for ways to avoid them
so she can jazzercise.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.184
I know you grew up in a shallow place
with shallow people,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.102
but you were never like them before.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.187
Mommy.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.190
No, no, no. Please. Let me.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.318
You're a good dad, man.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.321
Okay. It's one thing to take this shit
from Danny, but this asshole too?

04:39.404 --> 04:40.739
No, no, no.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.955
I'm shallow? That's what you think?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.835
I'm not trying
to hurt your feelings, Sheil.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.463
I'm just being honest.
You know, it's like Vladimir Ilich said,

04:56.547 --> 05:00.092
"The attitude of a political party
to its mistakes

05:00.175 --> 05:05.806
is the surest criteria of its intentions
to fulfill its obligations to the people."

05:08.600 --> 05:10.227
You're a fucking asshole.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.105
-What?
-Who was fulfilling their obligation

05:13.188 --> 05:16.859
when they got Danny to drop acid
and left me at the Shore Club alone?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.987
And when I got home
to an old, shirtless hippie frying fish,

05:20.070 --> 05:23.866
high with teenagers in my kitchen,
was that my mistake or yours?

05:23.949 --> 05:27.536
-Look, it's not my finest hours, Sheil.
-You're getting paid to do a job, Jerry.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.955
And I do not need to go
to every fucking meet and greet.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.250
That's what Mike Schmidt's wife does
because that's what Pat fucking Nixon did.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.753
But we're not doing things
that way, right?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.089
We want a new world order.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.888
I'll come to the most important events.
I'll tell you which ones they are.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.223
And the rest of them,
you're going to get me out of.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.726
Who's going to get me out of them?

05:50.809 --> 05:51.894
-You.
-Yes.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.062
-I mean me.
-That's what I meant. You.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.689
-Me. I'm--
-Yes.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.528
-Who? Who?
-Me, Jerry, is gonna get you out of 'em.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.613
Jerry.

06:05.908 --> 06:06.950
And just take that outside.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.786
In fact, go for a walk and bake.
I can't stand the sight of you.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.257
Hi. I tried calling.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.469
Is it okay if I left Maya here
for, like, an hour or two to--

06:25.552 --> 06:27.513
Ernie thinks
Miriam stole his video camera.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.723
What? Miriam, your nanny?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.517
Miriam, my everything.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.978
Miriam who irons Ernie's dress shirts.
Miriam who puts gas in the car.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.356
Miriam who knows all the words
to "Conjunction Junction,"

06:37.439 --> 06:38.482
'cause that song is so long.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.983
-What did she say?
-That she didn't.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.693
And I begged Ernie not to fire her.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.029
But he says that
I'm refusing to look at the truth

06:44.112 --> 06:45.531
that is right in front of my face.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.950
I mean, this is probably my fault, right?

06:48.033 --> 06:49.701
This is a good excuse to cheat on me

06:49.785 --> 06:51.745
because I'm too dumb
to know I hired a thief.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.622
I'm so sorry. This is terrible.

06:53.705 --> 06:54.915
No, no, I'm sorry.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.417
So I can't take Maya today
because I haven't slept,

06:57.501 --> 06:59.044
and the twins are on a tear.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.172
And I have to figure out
where Miriam keeps the-- everything, so...

07:02.256 --> 07:05.384
What if he just took it somewhere
and he used it and forgot about it, right?

07:05.467 --> 07:07.219
Or he just put it down in a new place?

07:07.302 --> 07:08.720
Is Miriam gonna be okay?

07:09.596 --> 07:12.891
I told the kids that she's on vacation,
but I think they know I'm lying.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.269
I don't know what that was.
I have to go. Good luck.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.980
Put that down! Goodbye. Bye.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.443
Hey.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.197
Who's this? The DJ?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.866
It's my daughter, Maya.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.368
-I'm sorry. My plans fell through.
-We should get started.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
Just 'cause we don't need a permit

07:32.870 --> 07:34.788
doesn't mean
the cops aren't gonna hassle us.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.166
Go! Hurry up.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.669
The lifeguard's been running
training drills all morning.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.589
That air horn's a new development, though.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.549
-Let's move it!
-Okay.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.092
-Hurry up!
-Come here, sweetie.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.433
Sweep.

07:55.434 --> 07:59.396
And sweep. Sweep. Sweep. Sweep.

08:00.022 --> 08:03.442
Five, six, seven, eight, and kick. Kick.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.235
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.739
-Don't lift your legs so high.
-Okay. Okay.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
Or maybe lift it higher?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.201
Higher? Okay.

08:12.701 --> 08:16.580
And kick. Kick. Kick.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.249
That's a bit too high, I think.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.503
-We should stop.
-Okay.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.090
Four, three, two, one, and jog.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.931
Yeah, I was completely out of focus.
That's my bad. Just do it again.

08:34.515 --> 08:38.143
Three, two, one, and punch it up.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.438
Punch it up. Punch it up.
Punch it up. Punch it up.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.523
Maya!

08:47.736 --> 08:49.571
Stay here. Come on.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.576
Let's keep going. Okay.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.746
Five, six, seven, eight, and--

08:58.830 --> 09:00.082
Maya!

09:11.218 --> 09:15.180
Lift those knees for eight, seven, six,

09:15.264 --> 09:17.683
five, four, three...

09:17.766 --> 09:19.810
They're all staring at you, heifer.

09:20.477 --> 09:24.106
They're all wondering
what the fuck you think you're doing.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.942
Who the fuck you think you are?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.199
Oh, God.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.166
That's-- I guess we're done.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.212
We got enough. Probably.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.964
He can't even look at you.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.341
There's definitely stuff there.

09:51.842 --> 09:55.095
With your wrinkly ass face
and your fat ass.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.305
Can I watch it first?

09:56.889 --> 09:59.099
Sure, I guess. I mean, how come?

09:59.183 --> 10:00.976
To teach myself a fucking lesson.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.060
Just to see.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.444
You should consider
actually buying one of these babies.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.613
Best thing to happen to families
since time-outs.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.364
I'm fine. Just renting one for now.

10:14.448 --> 10:18.452
And when you do, Betamax is by far
the superior format. By far.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.289
Better resolution, more stable image,
superior viewing experience.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.833
Yeah, I don't really care
about the resolution or the image.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.877
I just--
I just need to watch this one thing.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.297
Lady, we're in a format war.
The two techs are not compatible.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.007
People need to choose sides, it--

10:34.343 --> 10:35.344
I get it.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.429
Yep, never mind.

10:37.513 --> 10:38.805
You get what?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.727
If it's porn,
VHS should suit you just fine.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.145
Whatever. Enjoy.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.065
I'm not-- This is not porn.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.025
Yeah, I know the type.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.612
Hey, honey. Come on.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.253
-Five, six, seven, eight. Kick.
-Sheila?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.880
Hey. I thought you were
at the rest home with Jer.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.800
Yeah, I was.
But the residents got agitated

11:14.883 --> 11:17.344
because a bird got loose
in the sunroom, so...

11:17.427 --> 11:19.054
And you're pretty jumpy too.
You all right?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.974
Yeah.
No, I was just down here, tidying up.

11:22.057 --> 11:26.103
I'm gonna be on the Bill Gilmerton show.
You know, that public access debate thing?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.230
-Tomorrow.
-That is so great.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.775
-Isn't it?
-I don't know. You'd have to ask Jerry.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.235
He was the one pushing for it.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.446
Now it's pretty fucking obvious
he doesn't think I can handle it.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.365
Like, "Yeah.
That's a great opportunity, Dan Man,

11:38.448 --> 11:39.616
there's just a lot of unknowns."

11:39.700 --> 11:43.412
Meaning he thinks I'm gonna get tripped up
and put my foot in some shit.

11:43.495 --> 11:47.207
What's your source of information on that?
Is it you?

11:48.625 --> 11:49.626
Maybe.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.005
-Will you give me a foot rub?
-Yeah. Come on.

11:53.088 --> 11:53.922
Thanks.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.966
What kind of bird was it?

11:56.049 --> 11:59.303
It was--
I don't fucking know birds, Sheila.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.640
Add a sidestep.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.271
No wonder she said no
to this complete and utter shit.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.939
Hands on hips and roll.

12:11.440 --> 12:16.820
Who wants some middle-aged
fucking fat loser telling them what to do?

12:16.904 --> 12:17.905
And out.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.992
That shrieking, shrill voice.
Just shut up!

12:22.075 --> 12:25.621
Shut up with your fat ass
and your saggy tits!

12:26.330 --> 12:28.665
Why would anyone wanna listen to you?

12:38.675 --> 12:40.260
What the hell is this?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.255
This looks so much better.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.727
So you watch it? What do you think?

13:30.811 --> 13:31.687
I hate it.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.858
Everybody hates everything
till they don't.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.653
But so what?
You wanna write the whole thing off?

13:40.988 --> 13:42.155
It's not just that.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.740
Man.

13:44.366 --> 13:47.870
When you have no hair,
your face is, like, really your face, huh?

13:49.204 --> 13:51.248
That's what this makes you think?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.750
I shot a thing once
where a naked girl just sat on balloons

13:53.834 --> 13:55.460
and popped them for an hour.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.213
Also one where a woman rubbed
dollhouse furniture on her nips,

13:58.297 --> 14:00.340
-I don't even--
-You think this is a sex thing?

14:00.424 --> 14:02.634
Don't know. But it is.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.305
Although compared to a lot of other shit,
this is like fucking Bambi.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.849
It's like Charlie Manson girls. It's sick.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.728
I mean, shaving your head is not sick.
It's sick.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.147
Like, honestly,
I see why that guy's into it.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.025
Getting to watch somebody
do brave shit is sexy as hell.

14:18.734 --> 14:19.943
Is he a friend of yours?

14:20.652 --> 14:23.447
He's married to a friend.

14:23.947 --> 14:27.117
Well, he put a lot of work in here.
Like years, maybe.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.621
Does he know you let me tape over it?

14:33.290 --> 14:35.125
Probably he shouldn't find out.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.629
Your head feels so good.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.757
-You're making it tighter.
-I'm sorry.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.008
Don't pull it.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.385
We're sorry to say
we won't have Mr. Schmidt with us.

14:45.469 --> 14:48.138
A scheduling mix-up.
He sends his apologies.

14:48.222 --> 14:50.891
But the good news is
their campaign volunteered a replacement

14:50.974 --> 14:54.269
who is definitely qualified to speak
on the other side of the issues.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.403
They want to slap
some spackle on you, Danny.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.781
Yeah, well, just give me a second, Jerry.
Fuck.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.575
-Well, thank you, Bill.
-Yeah. Thank you.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.536
I cannot-- What?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.539
I'm not important enough
for fucking Schmidt to show up?

15:13.622 --> 15:16.208
They gotta send Mormon mall-bot instead?

15:16.291 --> 15:19.378
I should walk, right? Like I should just
walk the fuck out of here.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.214
Yeah. You're gonna get your ass
handed to you, buddy.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.299
You know, you need to relax.

15:24.383 --> 15:25.676
Yeah, I'm trying to.

15:28.136 --> 15:33.308
Oh, my God. Sheila the good witch
guiding me back home.

15:35.394 --> 15:36.937
-I'm gonna light up.
-Okay.

15:37.479 --> 15:40.315
Feel better. It's okay.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.733
There you go.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.529
You're okay, honey. Yeah. You're okay.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.866
God. I am under a lot of stress.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.534
-It's okay. It's okay.
-I know.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.828
-Yeah. Feel better.
-All right. Okay.

15:52.911 --> 15:56.957
-Just-- I mean, who cancels?
-I know.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.339
Why are we here? In this place?

16:04.423 --> 16:06.133
What's wrong with it?

16:06.216 --> 16:09.428
I still have never been to your home,
is what's wrong with it.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.388
You said you wanted to see me.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.350
If I went into a shop to buy clothes
like you're wearing,

16:15.934 --> 16:16.935
what would I call them?

16:18.979 --> 16:21.940
They have espresso here.
You want an espresso?

16:22.024 --> 16:24.693
Do I want some brown water? No.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.242
-There's a ceasefire now.
-I know. I watch the news.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.119
How would I know what you do?

16:34.203 --> 16:35.954
I don't even know where you live.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.417
A ceasefire, after Beirut is already gone.

16:40.501 --> 16:41.502
Down to rubble.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.587
Including the house. It's gone.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.549
Bombed out. Just like we would've been
if we were still in it.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.051
Wow.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.470
That's unbelievable. Fuck.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.140
I can't even... Fuck.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.727
What, did you think you were gonna
go back there someday?

16:58.810 --> 17:00.979
We can't even get you to come to Glendale.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.940
Is Mama okay? About the house?

17:03.023 --> 17:04.900
What do you think, Badiaa?

17:04.983 --> 17:06.984
She's been crying for weeks.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.488
She was so upset,
I thought she might call you.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.281
Tell her how sorry I am.

17:11.365 --> 17:14.660
Come back with me and you tell her.

17:15.661 --> 17:19.122
If you don't, Baba says that's it.

17:19.205 --> 17:24.586
What's "it"? He's gonna cut me off?
Didn't he do that already?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.589
He's not going to let any of us
talk to you anymore.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.758
Yeah, you'll hate that.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.345
Don't talk to me
because you don't want to, Georgette.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.889
Not because he says.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.771
How long can you
keep dyeing your hair that color

17:43.480 --> 17:44.773
before it all just goes...

17:46.900 --> 17:48.735
I guess we're gonna find out.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.700
Coastal development is
an evergreen issue in this community

17:54.783 --> 17:58.370
that nevertheless heats up
some election years more than others.

17:58.453 --> 18:01.331
And this is definitely one of those years.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.084
Why don't we start with you, Mr. Rubin?

18:04.168 --> 18:10.382
Since your "Save Our Wave" surf activism
is what put you in the conversation.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.592
Would you agree?

18:16.096 --> 18:19.141
Baked deer in headlights. Here we go.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.644
Well, Bill, I'd first like to just say

18:22.728 --> 18:25.063
that Save Our Wave
is an environmental philosophy

18:25.147 --> 18:28.275
that includes anyone
who cares about water quality

18:28.358 --> 18:30.736
or urban sprawl or coastal erosion.

18:30.819 --> 18:34.031
The surfers just feel those impacts sooner
than the rest of us

18:34.114 --> 18:35.866
because, I mean, let's face it,

18:35.949 --> 18:38.327
they're in the water more
than the rest of us, right?

18:38.410 --> 18:42.623
I mean, the CEQA, the Clean Water Act,
the Coastal Commission.

18:42.706 --> 18:45.918
We have those things
because the voters care.

18:46.001 --> 18:49.254
So you can't just roll the clock
back on them. The state has--

18:49.338 --> 18:50.964
Destroyed economic opportunity.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.342
Thwarted investment.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.761
Made it impossible
for responsible businessmen

18:55.844 --> 18:59.264
to engage in good faith efforts
to enhance the coastline.

18:59.348 --> 19:04.478
This "activism,"
it's just anti-development in disguise.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.562
Yeah?

19:05.646 --> 19:09.107
Well, please, tell us, what are your plans
for enhancing the coastline?

19:09.608 --> 19:10.859
More yacht parking?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.278
That's not fair.

19:13.362 --> 19:16.698
A triumph. Another goddamn triumph.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.116
...for rich people or is it for everybody?

19:18.200 --> 19:21.787
Fucking Danny Rubin making it look easy.
Right, Sheil?

19:22.454 --> 19:24.665
Five minutes ago,
he was ready to run for the hills.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.458
Guess the only loser around here is you.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.132
Guess you're not ready to go.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.764
Rotten egg smell is gnarly.

19:41.473 --> 19:46.186
Just hang in there.
It sort of starts to smell good.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.904
I know you don't like being hassled,
but I can tell something's up.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.407
I see it, but I'm not gonna ask.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.119
Unless you want me to.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.621
If you want me to,
I'll ask the shit out of you.

20:07.165 --> 20:09.126
Why don't you let me do the hair?

20:10.669 --> 20:13.630
I know how. I've watched you enough times.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.217
And you're catching me
at the perfect time to be helpful.

20:17.718 --> 20:21.680
I am... What's the opposite of high?

20:23.599 --> 20:24.600
Low.

20:25.851 --> 20:27.060
Unimpaired.

20:28.145 --> 20:29.605
Your word is good too.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.655
That presumes there'll be anything left
for the voters of this district

20:38.739 --> 20:42.576
when you finish trying to save the ocean.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.620
And you say...

20:47.372 --> 20:51.668
So then I say,
"John, to be perfectly honest with you,

20:51.752 --> 20:54.922
I will never be finished
trying to save the ocean."

21:00.052 --> 21:02.137
That was beautiful.

21:02.638 --> 21:04.097
Hey, Sheila, you want...

21:04.181 --> 21:06.308
you want
a little pearl onion or cornichon?

21:06.391 --> 21:09.228
Yeah. Yeah. So good.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.312
Just...

21:12.147 --> 21:14.358
whichever. I don't really care.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.152
How about you, Gret? Get in here. Come on.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.321
Oh, no. No. She's bad with dairy.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.823
-What?
-Real bad, if you catch my drift.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.618
Yeah, yeah.

21:25.494 --> 21:27.287
Why did we come here then?

21:28.914 --> 21:31.333
-'Cause it's Ernie's favorite.
-So what did we decide on?

21:31.416 --> 21:36.421
Did we decide? We're gonna do
the Incredible Shrinking Woman at 7:15

21:36.505 --> 21:39.258
or the 8:20 Fort Apache, the Bronx?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.052
There's nothing else out yet?

21:44.012 --> 21:45.639
I don't know.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.432
Greta, you bring the art section?

21:47.516 --> 21:49.309
-The what?
-The art section.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.270
I can't understand what you're saying.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.064
I should check on Maya.
She looked a little peaky before I left.

21:54.565 --> 21:56.525
And so I'm just gonna run.

21:57.192 --> 21:59.862
If you guys could give Danny
a ride home, that would be great.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.196
Have fun at the movie.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.865
Is she okay?

22:02.948 --> 22:05.284
-What's that?
-Maya, is she all right?

22:05.367 --> 22:06.493
Yeah. I don't--

22:07.160 --> 22:09.997
-I wasn't yelling. I was just--
-Ernie, it's fine.

22:21.258 --> 22:24.636
That was the last time, okay?

22:24.720 --> 22:25.971
Now get home.

22:37.316 --> 22:38.942
...last night.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.494
I hear Katherine what's-her-name...

22:57.377 --> 23:00.297
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.758
Just cut through Mrs. Ballard's yard.

23:02.841 --> 23:05.511
She leaves her dog out at night.
I'm really fine to go the long way.

23:05.594 --> 23:07.888
I don't want the long way.
I want you to do what I'm asking.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.432
-But why does it matter which way?
-I don't want to tell your mom

23:10.516 --> 23:12.559
that I found you here
with a beer on grunion night

23:12.643 --> 23:14.269
when you were supposed
to be watching Maya.

23:14.353 --> 23:15.646
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rubin.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.941
Just chuck this at Mrs. Ballard's dog,
and we'll see you Friday.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.109
I'll see you guys.
Let's do it again, all right?

23:23.278 --> 23:25.531
The movie was dog shit.
I couldn't even sit through it.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.910
-What the fuck happened to you?
-What? My hair? I just put it up. It's--

23:29.993 --> 23:32.788
No, no, no. Your eye.
It's, like, really bloodshot.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.624
Let me see it. That's gruesome.
Have you been rubbing that?

23:35.707 --> 23:38.043
Maya, she punches me sometimes.

23:38.126 --> 23:41.922
Our daughter punches you?
Like, in your face?

23:42.881 --> 23:44.633
She doesn't mean to. She just does.

23:46.009 --> 23:49.680
It's a good thing you're off the hook
for the Rotary Club breakfast tomorrow.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.183
Jerry said we should cut you some slack
with the canvassing, so we will.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.853
But I'm gonna miss you.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.110
Fondue place was great,
but I'm gonna be bound up for a week.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.452
Anything you wanna ask me?

24:13.453 --> 24:14.454
No.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.334
Tyler cut some stuff together
from what you guys did.

24:19.918 --> 24:22.462
Played around with it.
It's still gonzo, but...

24:24.423 --> 24:26.258
I get it. I get what you meant.

24:29.303 --> 24:30.429
What did I mean?

24:31.513 --> 24:36.059
I'm just saying you don't have nothing.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.771
I guess we're making a fucking videotape.

24:42.733 --> 24:44.776
I wanna smoke. Do you want one?

24:47.196 --> 24:48.197
No.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.950
How can you smoke?

24:52.451 --> 24:53.702
How can you not?

24:56.371 --> 24:57.789
Hey. What's going on?

24:58.332 --> 24:59.958
John fucking Breem is what.

25:00.042 --> 25:02.920
Okay, after the second segment, they said.
Everybody shut up.

25:03.003 --> 25:06.590
...hang ten with her surfer owner.
Plus, your forecast after this.

25:07.966 --> 25:12.221
This is how Commander
Mike "Schmitty" Schmidt spent the 1960s.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.602
And here's Mike Schmidt today.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.606
He looks good.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.777
This is how Daniel Rubin spent the 1960s.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.411
What goddamn fucking narcs
did they get these from?

25:36.495 --> 25:38.747
And here's Daniel Rubin today.

25:44.628 --> 25:48.757
The choice is yours. Paid for by
Mike Schmidt for state assembly.

25:50.801 --> 25:53.762
Isn't this good?
Now we know that they see you as a threat.

25:53.846 --> 25:58.433
This is a fucking hatchet job.
We have to hit them back. Hard.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.560
Hit them back with what?

25:59.643 --> 26:01.979
Where's that videographer
you said you had lined up?

26:02.938 --> 26:06.567
-Don't tell me you dropped the ball there.
-What did you say? Drop the what?

26:06.650 --> 26:09.361
Just get the guy on deck
like you said you would. Okay, Sheil?

26:09.444 --> 26:12.948
We can't let this get traction.
We have to make our own ad.

26:13.532 --> 26:14.575
Tomorrow.
