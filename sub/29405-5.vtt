WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:03.071
ANNOUNCER: Everyday heroes
doing extraordinary things.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.338
9-1-1 returns.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.506
We're gonna find you.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.141
ANNOUNCER: Catch
all-new episodes Mondays

00:07.175 --> 00:09.377
and check out
our other Fox programs.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.912
Prodigal Son, Almost Family
and  The Resident.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.381
There's more to the story
than you know.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.948
Only on Fox.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.653
(The Pretenders' "Precious")

00:19.687 --> 00:21.722
(people screaming, laughing)

00:21.755 --> 00:23.324
(grunts)

00:23.357 --> 00:25.859
A rage room?
Denise, this is silly.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.528
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.029
We get to smash
a bunch of junk.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.831
-I don't know.
-Oh, Emily.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.200
We are doing this.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.701
When is the last time
you allowed yourself

00:33.734 --> 00:35.002
to feel angry?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.338
I mean, really angry.
Never.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.373
Even after Eric asked you
for the divorce.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.608
Just think of his face

00:40.641 --> 00:42.943
every time
you smash something to pieces.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.445
Okay, I'm in.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.913
(bell rings)

00:45.946 --> 00:49.283
(glass shattering)

00:49.317 --> 00:51.085
-Hm.
-Shall we?

00:51.119 --> 00:53.287
(bell ringing)

00:53.321 --> 00:55.523
(grunts)

00:55.556 --> 00:57.057
Whoo! You're up!

01:01.595 --> 01:02.730
I don't think this is working.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.932
Come on!
You gotta reach down deep

01:04.965 --> 01:07.301
and find your rage!

01:07.335 --> 01:08.736
(laughs)

01:11.472 --> 01:12.940
-Okay.
-Remember when you made

01:12.973 --> 01:15.809
that big anniversary dinner
and Eric didn't even show up?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.411
Didn't that piss you off?

01:17.445 --> 01:19.980
Yes, I spent $400
on a sous-vide

01:20.013 --> 01:21.315
and boiled meat
in a plastic bag.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.552
-Yeah, you did.
-Oh. Okay.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.719
That a girl!

01:25.753 --> 01:27.388
What about the time
when he took

01:27.421 --> 01:28.889
that boys' trip up in Big Bear

01:28.922 --> 01:31.625
and he left you home alone
with a sick two-year-old?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.794
I was covered in puke
and poop

01:33.827 --> 01:34.962
and he was at a ski lodge

01:34.995 --> 01:37.631
sipping bourbon
and smoking cigars!

01:37.665 --> 01:39.633
And what about
that thing he does

01:39.667 --> 01:42.403
where he barks like a seal
when he's having sex?

01:42.436 --> 01:46.140
I mean, what is that about?

01:48.709 --> 01:49.843
I never told you about that.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.079
Sure, you did. Ahh--

01:52.112 --> 01:54.182
I mean, you must have.
You tell me everything.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.016
Oh, my God.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.018
I knew there was someone else.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.321
And it was you!

02:00.354 --> 02:02.356
No, no, it's--it's not.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.358
-(screams)
-I mean, not recently.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.927
You're supposed to be
my best friend!

02:06.960 --> 02:10.298
-(screams)
-(grunting)

02:10.330 --> 02:11.365
(screaming)

02:11.399 --> 02:12.700
(whimpering)

02:12.733 --> 02:14.034
EMILY: (screaming)

02:18.038 --> 02:20.874
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
What is that noise?

02:20.908 --> 02:23.277
DENISE: Friend!
I've unleashed a monster.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.812
-She's gonna kill me.
-Ma'am, can you tell me

02:24.845 --> 02:26.547
-where you're calling from?
-DENISE: Happy's Rage Room,

02:26.580 --> 02:27.515
downtown!

02:27.548 --> 02:29.049
HEN: Apart from a blowout bar,

02:29.082 --> 02:31.785
this is the dumbest thing
people in L.A. pay money for.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.721
I think it's genius.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.556
Your victim's in there.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.293
-Where?
-(sighs)

02:39.327 --> 02:41.829
There. Your victim
climbed into the barrel

02:41.862 --> 02:43.497
after her BFF
started chasing her

02:43.531 --> 02:44.998
-with a sledgehammer.
-I thought the point

02:45.032 --> 02:47.401
was to smash things,
not each other.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.069
Wife. Mistress.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.206
Adulterous slut!

02:52.240 --> 02:53.574
Does the adulterous slut
have a name?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.710
Denise. She can't hear you
very well in there.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.979
Ears ringing.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.714
BOBBY:
Denise, are you hurt?

03:00.748 --> 03:02.483
-DENISE: What?
-Ah, looks like

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
she's sledge hammered in there
pretty good, Cap.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.153
Lena, Eddie, saws and jaws.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.488
On it, Cap.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.056
Denise, we're gonna
cut you out of there.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.658
DENISE: What?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.159
(saw whirring)

03:12.192 --> 03:15.162
(dramatic music)

03:15.195 --> 03:21.769
*

03:22.903 --> 03:25.906
(metal groaning)

03:30.143 --> 03:31.879
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.514
Wait, excuse me.
Please, don't arrest her.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.283
This is all my fault.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.718
You wanna be a better friend?
Bail her out.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.254
I'd rather rot in jail

03:40.288 --> 03:42.089
than have her
do another thing for me.

03:42.122 --> 03:44.925
EMILY:
I should've never trusted you!

03:44.958 --> 03:47.395
Consider this
the end of our friendship!

03:47.428 --> 03:49.229
I hate you! Next time--

03:49.263 --> 03:52.199
So much anger
in the world these days.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.201
I can see why this place
is all the rage.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.705
-See what I did there?
-(scoffs) Oh, I see it.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
(laughter)

04:01.074 --> 04:04.878
-(phone buttons beep)
-(siren whirs)

04:04.912 --> 04:07.548
I'm really sorry about this.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.383
I thought I was gonna
have the day off.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.051
Oh, it's fine.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.886
Pretty sure I'm gonna have
an easier day than you are.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.988
(chuckles) A root canal
would be more fun.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.423
-(chuckles)
-(phone chimes)

04:16.457 --> 04:18.058
(gasps)

04:18.091 --> 04:19.827
Six--

04:19.860 --> 04:21.962
Six embryos made it.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.931
They're sending them
for testing, and then--

04:23.964 --> 04:25.433
HEN: We can schedule
the transfer.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.502
(both laugh)

04:29.937 --> 04:31.405
I guess
we have to start deciding

04:31.439 --> 04:33.607
exactly how many
little pairs of feet

04:33.641 --> 04:35.509
we want
stomping around this house.

04:35.543 --> 04:38.746
(both laugh)

04:38.779 --> 04:40.481
Mom, have you seen
my phone charger?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.350
Why am I the lost and found?

04:42.383 --> 04:46.420
In the kitchen.
Next to the coffee maker.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.788
And hurry! Let's go!

04:47.821 --> 04:49.122
What time
are you and Bobby leaving?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.458
We're not.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.692
What? I thought you guys
were going

04:51.725 --> 04:53.661
-to that B&B up the coast.
-Canceled,

04:53.694 --> 04:54.862
on account of a lawsuit.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.365
Buck's suing the city
to get his job back.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.368
Bobby has to go in for
an arbitration hearing today.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.470
Wow. Last time I saw Buck

05:02.503 --> 05:04.438
he was coughing up blood
on the patio.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.374
Oh, yeah.
He's a sweet kid,

05:06.407 --> 05:08.376
but I need to stop
inviting him over.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.544
Chaos inevitably ensues.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.446
That sounds like a great idea.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.781
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't

05:13.814 --> 05:15.549
invited him over for dinner.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.050
Excuse you.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.019
And that would be my cue.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.355
Hey, Harry!
Come on, let's go, man!

05:21.389 --> 05:23.791
You know your grandmother's
expecting us for lunch.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.826
And if we're late,
I am definitely blaming you.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.795
It won't matter.
It's genetically impossible

05:27.828 --> 05:29.062
for GG to get mad at me.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.130
(laughs)

05:30.163 --> 05:32.700
-Bye, Bobby.
-You two be good.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.569
Don't give your dad
too much trouble.

05:35.603 --> 05:38.572
-Give GG a kiss hello for me.
-I will.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.408
Have fun!

05:41.909 --> 05:43.544
*

05:43.577 --> 05:47.648
So, what is that about
this Buck thing being my fault?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.484
I think I'll exercise
my right to remain silent.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.219
I love you.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.054
(laughs)

05:55.589 --> 05:56.724
ARBITRATOR:
This is not a trial,

05:56.757 --> 05:58.426
and I am not a judge.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.928
This arbitration will address
Mr. Buckley's claim

06:00.961 --> 06:02.830
against the Los Angeles
Fire Department

06:02.863 --> 06:03.997
for wrongful termination.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.866
Buck wasn't terminated.
He still has his job.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.668
CHASE: It's our position
that Firefighter Buckley,

06:07.701 --> 06:09.102
while not technically fired,

06:09.136 --> 06:10.704
has been
constructively terminated

06:10.738 --> 06:12.873
from all components
of firefighting duty.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.675
A defacto firing.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.209
Which is a direct result
of a pattern

06:16.243 --> 06:18.378
of discriminatory
and unequal treatment

06:18.412 --> 06:21.048
-on the part of Captain Nash.
-Unequal treatment?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.883
I don't treat Buck
any differently

06:22.916 --> 06:25.218
than I do any other firefighter
under my watch.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.120
-Really?
-Really.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.424
See, I was hit from behind
with a construction truck

06:30.458 --> 06:32.560
and the rebar entered
the back of my skull

06:32.593 --> 06:35.062
and went right through my brain
and exited my forehead.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.565
-See that little scar?
-Yeah.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.800
It's all I ended up with.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.101
That's miraculous.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.705
And how long did it take
before you returned to work?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.374
Uh...

06:47.407 --> 06:48.742
several weeks.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.044
No, you know what?
It was more closer to a month.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.447
I'm a quick healer, evidently.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.115
CHASE: Evidently.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.618
And your more recent
medical trauma--

06:57.651 --> 06:59.219
after you were
stabbed repeatedly

06:59.252 --> 07:00.888
by your girlfriend's
ex-husband--

07:00.921 --> 07:03.757
How long before you were back
with the 118?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.893
That was also about a month.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.561
CHASE: Hm. So it's fair to say

07:07.595 --> 07:08.929
Captain Nash
has followed a pattern

07:08.962 --> 07:10.898
of allowing firefighters
with serious injuries

07:10.931 --> 07:12.900
back after less than a month.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.603
No, I don't think
it is fair to say.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.772
Every patient is different.
Every injury is different.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.241
The blood thinners
that Buck has to take right now

07:21.274 --> 07:23.477
makes it very dangerous
for him to be in the field.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.445
Tell me...

07:25.479 --> 07:27.380
do you recognize
this brochure?

07:29.717 --> 07:30.818
Yes.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.922
Can you tell us what it is?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.625
HEN: It's a commercial brochure
for anticoagulant

07:37.658 --> 07:39.026
blood thinner medication.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.529
Medications
that you yourself sold

07:41.562 --> 07:43.163
in your former career
as a pharmaceutical rep.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.532
-Is that right?
-Yes.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.600
And in your sales pitch
to your doctor clients,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.802
was it your contention
that these medications

07:48.836 --> 07:50.971
would allow patients
to resume their normal lives?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
I was a sales rep,
not a doctor.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.441
But you were a field medic.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.879
Doesn't qualify me to comment
on Buck's medical status.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.881
It does make me understand
the chain of command.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.650
And if Cap says he's not ready,
he's not ready.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.451
Were you ready,
Firefighter Diaz,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.186
to return to work
after your wife's death?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.320
That's my business.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.488
CHASE: It's also
your Captain's business.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.323
He never suggested
you take some time?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.893
-See a counselor?
-He wasn't there at the time.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.327
'Cause he'd been suspended.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.329
Captain Nash's suspension
was adjudicated.

08:16.363 --> 08:17.565
I don't see how it is relevant

08:17.598 --> 08:19.199
-to this proceeding.
-It's relevant

08:19.232 --> 08:21.735
because it illustrates
how everyone except Mr. Buckley

08:21.769 --> 08:23.036
is allowed to return
to the job,

08:23.070 --> 08:25.005
no matter the injury
or infraction.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.207
Buck has a chronic
medical condition.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.876
And what about your own
chronic medical condition,

08:28.909 --> 08:30.544
Captain Nash?

08:30.578 --> 08:32.179
I believe the
National Institute of Health

08:32.212 --> 08:35.849
classifies alcoholism
as a chronic brain disease.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.017
I'm clean and sober.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.518
You are now,
and you were before.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.187
But isn't it true
that just about

08:40.220 --> 08:44.825
a year and a half ago,
you did have a relapse?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.426
I did.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.729
After the Liberty jet crash,
I drank.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.730
I was not on duty.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.331
But it was you and Mr. Buckley

08:51.364 --> 08:53.366
who found Bobby
passed out in his apartment.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.069
Yes.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.638
That happened.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.575
I did not know about that.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.543
That was before I got here.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.879
You asked my client
for his help that day.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.181
That's exactly what he did,
without hesitation.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.350
He helped you get sobered up,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.419
and then you returned
to your full duties

09:12.452 --> 09:14.354
as captain of the 118.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.724
-Yes, that's all true.
-So isn't the only difference

09:16.757 --> 09:19.259
between your off-duty relapse
and Mr. Buckley's

09:19.292 --> 09:21.461
is that he actually
did everything in his power

09:21.494 --> 09:23.931
to help you return to your job.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.405
CHASE: Well, I thought
that went great.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.108
I'll let you know what I hear.
Okay? You did good.

09:35.142 --> 09:42.082
*

09:47.320 --> 09:49.389
CLAIRE:
Come on, let's go, let's go.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.259
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.727
We're here at
the McDouglas duck farm

09:53.761 --> 09:54.895
where countless
innocent duck lives

09:54.928 --> 09:56.596
are being snuffed out
on a daily basis.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.832
If the law won't shut 'em down,
we will.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.267
If you want
to support our mission,

10:00.300 --> 10:01.635
please, go to our website.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.603
Get mad!

10:03.637 --> 10:05.005
TOBY: We're right here.
We're here for you guys.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.006
We're coming.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.842
(ducks quacking)

10:08.876 --> 10:10.410
We're here in
the slaughterhouse

10:10.443 --> 10:13.080
where these defenseless
will get clamp to these hooks

10:13.113 --> 10:14.581
and conveyed to their deaths.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.483
Mechanized murder!

10:16.516 --> 10:17.985
Not on our watch.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.586
(metal clanging)

10:19.619 --> 10:21.822
CLAIRE: Over there.
Under the machine. Let's go.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.260
The hell are you people
doing here?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.430
Exercising our First Amendment
right to protest.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.765
Like hell.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.033
You're trespassing!

10:33.066 --> 10:35.468
We're making sure no more
innocent ducks die today.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.537
Oh, don't do that!

10:37.570 --> 10:40.140
-Don't do that!
-Rage against the cage.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.443
ALL: Rage against the cage!
Rage against the cage!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.979
-Rage against the cage!
-Hey, hey, hey!

10:46.013 --> 10:47.781
ALL:
Rage against the cage!

10:47.815 --> 10:51.184
Oh, no, no, no!
Now that's just vandalism.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.153
(alarm blares)

10:53.186 --> 10:55.622
-CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
-Oh, crap.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.125
CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.860
-Turn it off!
-(screaming)

10:59.893 --> 11:01.895
-(shouting)
-CLAIRE: Turn it off!

11:01.929 --> 11:08.001
Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

11:08.035 --> 11:10.337
(choking)

11:15.175 --> 11:17.344
The damn fools
locked themselves to the belt

11:17.377 --> 11:18.879
and the motor got kicked on.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.047
Now it seems to be stuck.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.648
BOBBY:
Can you cut the power?

11:21.681 --> 11:24.517
RICK: I do that, I got 1,400
duck carcasses starting to rot.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.886
Toby, where is the key
to your lock?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.988
-I can't find it.
-I swallowed it.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.189
You swallowed it?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.358
We didn't say anything
about swallowing the keys!

11:31.391 --> 11:33.326
Oh, you withheld information
from your team.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.228
How's that working out for you?

11:35.262 --> 11:37.430
-Lena, bolt cutters!
-Sir, try not to struggle.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.100
Coming in hot!

11:40.133 --> 11:41.501
(grunts, coughing)

11:41.534 --> 11:43.837
I got some bruising, possible
swelling of the trachea.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.105
We're gonna get you
to the hospital.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.339
They'll check you out there.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.742
I'm fine. I don't need to go
to the hospital.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.911
He needs to go to jail.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.946
(machinery winds down)

11:52.980 --> 11:55.048
Hey, did you just
shut that off?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.850
So?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.351
So you could've done that
the whole time,

11:58.385 --> 11:59.352
and you just let it run?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.388
-Ah, man, they were trespass--

12:01.421 --> 12:02.890
-They're just idiot kids!
They could've died!

12:02.923 --> 12:05.458
Bobby!

12:05.492 --> 12:08.561
(coughing)

12:10.163 --> 12:11.731
It's gotta be that key.
Keep coughing, buddy.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.468
-HEN: Toby? Toby? What's wrong?
-Starting the Heimlich!

12:15.502 --> 12:16.469
-He's not breathing.
-All right, get him

12:16.503 --> 12:18.705
on a backboard, now! Let's go!

12:18.738 --> 12:19.706
-Ready?
-CLAIRE: Something's not right.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.741
Toby? He's not--
He's dying.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.077
-HEN: I got a pulse.
-CHIMNEY: Let's ventilate.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.380
CLAIRE: Oh, I'm scared.
I'm scared, Toby.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.382
He's dying, guys.
This is not--

12:29.416 --> 12:30.984
(coughing)

12:31.018 --> 12:32.052
The key must've
torn his trachea.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.586
We gotta try
to get it out.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.924
CHIMNEY: Lena, my bag.
Magill forceps.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.227
Oh, God. Please don't let him
die on my property.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.762
*

12:42.796 --> 12:45.065
CLAIRE:
(breathing heavily) Oh.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.734
-HEN: Stable.
-CLAIRE: Oh!

12:47.767 --> 12:49.102
He never told me he was
gonna eat that key.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.570
HEN: He's still not breathing.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.905
Two more rescue breaths.

12:51.939 --> 12:56.176
*

12:56.209 --> 12:57.510
Chest is rising.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.679
He's breathing.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.415
You still wanna press charges?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.683
-I think we're good.
-CHIMNEY: All right,

13:03.716 --> 13:04.952
let's get him on a gurney,
on three.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.020
NICK:
* I'm a sucker for you

13:07.054 --> 13:09.022
*

13:09.056 --> 13:11.358
You know,
I thought that we agreed

13:11.391 --> 13:14.294
to be technology free
on this trip.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.797
We just passed
L.A. city limit.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.100
-Oh, God.
-(laughs)

13:20.133 --> 13:21.634
Could you at least
check on your brother

13:21.668 --> 13:22.970
and make sure
he's still breathing.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.105
I think he's in a food coma
from GG's cooking.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.274
Ohh, that's the only way
to go.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.609
(both laugh)

13:29.642 --> 13:31.544
Ooh!

13:33.013 --> 13:36.016
Mm, call your mother
and tell her we'll be home

13:36.049 --> 13:38.451
-in about half an hour.
-Okay.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.989
(siren chirps, horn blares)

13:42.022 --> 13:45.058
-Or not.
-(siren continues)

13:53.600 --> 13:55.002
Come on!

14:00.407 --> 14:03.376
(radio chatter)

14:03.410 --> 14:10.217
*

14:10.250 --> 14:11.751
Hey.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.688
License and registration.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.691
It's in the glove box.
You mind if I reach for it?

14:20.427 --> 14:21.861
All right.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.164
(opens glove box)

14:24.197 --> 14:26.199
All right. Here you go.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.201
This your car?

14:28.235 --> 14:30.603
It's on the paperwork.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.372
Step out of the car, sir.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.042
What? Why?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.944
Ah, it's fine, baby.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.778
Sit tight.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.851
Where you coming from?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.020
Visiting my mother.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.855
Do you mind if I ask
why you pulled me over?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.391
Expired tags.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.060
Wait here
while I run your information.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.062
Oh, wait a minute. Wait.
I--I actually

14:55.095 --> 14:56.296
-have the tags in my car--
-Don't move.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.365
Turn around,
put your hands on the hood

14:58.398 --> 15:00.133
and wait here
while I run your plates.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.302
Excuse me?
Hold on for a second.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.704
-I said don't move!
-Oh! Okay, okay, okay!

15:04.737 --> 15:05.872
-Hands on the hood!
-(phone beeps)

15:05.905 --> 15:07.207
REYNOLDS: Our friend here
is having trouble

15:07.240 --> 15:08.541
listening to directions.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.977
-Please, miss.
-What are you doing to my dad?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.912
-Get back in the vehicle.
-May, get back in the car!

15:12.946 --> 15:14.247
-Do what he says.
-No, they can't just

15:14.281 --> 15:16.249
-treat us like this.
-REYNOLDS: Take her phone.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.884
-Stop.
-Back seat!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.152
-No, no, no!
-Dad!

15:19.186 --> 15:20.153
-Hands in the air!
-No, no, stop, stop, stop!

15:20.187 --> 15:21.821
-No!
-Hands in the--

15:21.854 --> 15:23.056
-Get off me!
-(all shouting)

15:23.090 --> 15:24.591
-Back in the car, now!
-Do not move!

15:24.624 --> 15:27.827
Please don't shoot my son!
Don't you shoot my son!

15:29.162 --> 15:32.132
Look, my wife is a sergeant.

15:32.165 --> 15:36.303
Her name is Athena Grant.
LAPD.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.570
Please.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.873
*

15:43.476 --> 15:46.446
(somber music)

15:46.479 --> 15:52.019
*

15:52.052 --> 15:53.853
It's just a kid.

15:55.722 --> 15:59.492
Come here. Come here,
come here, come here.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.363
Okay. It's okay.
Harry, sit tight, man.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.265
REYNOLDS: It's all good.
You got this.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.699
Yeah.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.172
You folks have a nice night,
then.

16:12.205 --> 16:19.212
*

16:20.713 --> 16:22.349
Come on.

16:22.382 --> 16:26.953
Come here, man. Ahh.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.522
Ahh, okay.
We're good.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.291
MICHAEL: We're good.
You get in the car, now.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.527
Let's go. Let's go, yeah?
All right.

16:34.561 --> 16:41.534
*

16:44.104 --> 16:46.573
-(engine starts)
-(siren chirps)

16:46.606 --> 16:50.077
*

16:57.417 --> 17:00.087
Shoot first,
and then ask questions later.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.421
That's how they're trained.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.756
But they didn't
fire their weapons, thank God.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.358
All right? It was just
a bad stop. They happen.

17:06.393 --> 17:09.096
They pulled their guns,
Athena.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.762
It wasn't just a bad stop.

17:10.797 --> 17:14.201
We will file a complaint.
There will be an investigation.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.667
And what do you think
the determination

17:15.702 --> 17:17.002
will be of that?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.271
Let me save you the paperwork.

17:18.305 --> 17:22.040
We'd be lucky
for a slap on the wrist.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.609
Is Dad gonna get arrested?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.913
What? No, man. Come here.

17:26.945 --> 17:28.415
Hey, listen, my man.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.783
Daddy's not going anywhere.
It's okay.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.385
No, it's not okay.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.221
They could've killed Harry,
and they could've killed you.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.755
May. Please, now.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.691
What? It's the truth.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.026
Why do they do that to us?

17:40.059 --> 17:43.196
'Cause they were afraid, honey.
And they overreacted.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.065
They were afraid
because they saw me

17:46.099 --> 17:48.635
as a big, scary black man.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.370
Well, arguing with the police

17:50.403 --> 17:52.205
probably wasn't
the best choice.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.740
Wait a minute.
Are you blaming me for this?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.041
No.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.210
Well, you're giving them
the benefit of the doubt.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.312
-Because I am them!
-Right.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.647
All right,
I know what it's like.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.549
You're walking up to a car,
all right?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.217
You're out in the open,
exposed.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.818
You don't know
what's waiting for you

18:05.852 --> 18:07.387
when you walk up
to that window.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.290
It's a father and his two kids.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.625
So you don't think
that maybe that was the moment

18:12.659 --> 18:14.294
that they should've stood down?

18:14.327 --> 18:16.396
Yes! All right?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.899
And the idea of what
could've happened terrifies me.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.903
So it's not as simple
as pick a side.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.239
How can you be a cop when they
treat black people like this?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.808
It is not all cops, May.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.677
The good outnumber the bad.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.445
Not when the good
choose to look the other way

18:32.479 --> 18:33.680
when the bad
do stuff like this.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.448
No one is looking
the other way.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.451
Really? Because those cops
will go home tonight

18:38.485 --> 18:40.153
and they'll probably
sleep easy.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.155
Business as usual for them.

18:42.189 --> 18:45.425
But our son and daughter
are sitting here, traumatized.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.959
You know what?

18:46.993 --> 18:48.528
They're not gonna forget
what they did to us, okay?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.497
I have it all on my cell phone.
I'm posting the video.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.998
You will not.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.966
We do not need
that kind of attention.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.802
This family doesn't.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.704
You and Harry's face online,

18:57.737 --> 19:00.340
just forever associated
with that incident.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.575
I do not want that for you.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.512
You're right,
you're right, you're right.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.846
Your mother--
your mother's right.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.848
Besides, nobody got shot,
right?

19:08.881 --> 19:11.551
Probably wouldn't get
that much of a reaction anyway.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.687
Michael,
the police are not the enemy.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.457
All right?
It's not us versus them.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.559
I do not wanna
teach our kids that.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.195
Then tell your colleagues that.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.396
Because that's how I felt

19:23.430 --> 19:26.065
when they pulled a gun out
on our son!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.437
(sighs)

19:34.374 --> 19:35.708
Okay, bud.

19:35.742 --> 19:39.078
Let's go.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.381
All right, strong legs.
There we go.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.149
Are you sure about this?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.717
I'm gonna have Carla
pick you up after the party.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.487
No, Dad. I--I wanna go.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.889
Hey, guys!
You made it!

19:49.922 --> 19:51.391
Dillon is so excited!

19:51.424 --> 19:53.226
Maybe now he'll stop
talking about it.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.027
Wait, who am I kidding?
No, he won't.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.529
-(laughs)
-You got my emails, right?

19:56.563 --> 19:59.666
I did. Very detailed.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.934
All right.
Be good, have fun.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.503
Call me
if you need anything, okay?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.705
Okay, Dad.
I love you.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.207
I love you too, kid.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.510
All right.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.780
(laughing)

20:15.248 --> 20:17.417
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.052
He's going to be okay, Eddie.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.922
EDDIE: I know. He hasn't had
a nightmare in a week.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.758
The doctor says a sleepover
will be great for him.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.560
I'm not sure how good
it's gonna be for me.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.728
Listen, don't worry.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.930
Dillon's got this whole
camping situation

20:30.963 --> 20:32.064
set up in the backyard,

20:32.098 --> 20:33.900
and Ron'll be in the tent
next to them.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.468
Okay, we'll call you
if there's any problem.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.037
Now, go relax. Recharge.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.541
I will return him to you
in one piece tomorrow.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.076
-Thanks, Tasha.
-Mm-hmm.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.953
Hey, that's a handicapped spot.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.555
-I know.
-Oh, you know.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.056
(laughs) Oh, that's rich.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.158
I had knee surgery
and had to park three rows in,

20:59.191 --> 21:00.827
but, uh, look at you.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.729
Must be nice to own the world.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.397
Look, I'm not doing this
with you, man.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.966
My kid has CP,
and I just dropped him off.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.401
Yeah, I'm sure.
Like those guys

21:08.435 --> 21:10.303
that put dummies
in their passenger seats

21:10.337 --> 21:13.340
so they can
use the carpool lane.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.775
-Did you just insult my kid?
-I ain't insulting anybody.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.009
I'm calling you out.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.678
You got something
to say about that?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.112
(siren wails)

21:20.146 --> 21:21.247
(gate buzzing)

21:21.280 --> 21:22.915
Thanks for coming
to bail me out.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.283
I was surprised
to get your call.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.685
I didn't realize we reached

21:25.718 --> 21:27.253
the bail each other out of jail
phase of our friendship.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.955
EDDIE: Well, there's no way
I was gonna call my abuela

21:28.988 --> 21:31.991
or the 118, and I'm not allowed
to talk to Buck.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.460
Look, I don't mind the bailing,

21:33.493 --> 21:35.328
but I'm a little concerned
about the jailing part.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.029
I guess I just snapped.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.432
-You punched a handicapped guy.
-He wasn't handicapped.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.167
He had a bad--
he had a bad knee,

21:41.200 --> 21:42.301
there's a difference.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.803
It won't happen again.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.505
-Lesson learned.
-Hope so.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.608
I also hope this guy
doesn't have a lawyer.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.944
*

21:51.978 --> 21:53.646
(knocking)

21:53.680 --> 21:56.783
Yeah, I got a client meeting.
I'll call you back.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.651
Boy, you got here fast.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.853
Hope you didn't break any laws
on the way here.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.121
Though, I do know someone.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.692
You, uh, you said
you had big news?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.093
The biggest.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.965
-Uh, what--what is this?
-That is the city's offer.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.535
They wanna settle. Now,
it's only a jumping off point.

22:15.568 --> 22:16.869
We can counter.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.005
Th--this is all
they're offering?

22:19.038 --> 22:23.543
(laughs) Did I, uh--
did I forget a zero?

22:23.576 --> 22:24.644
No, I got it right.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.145
You do understand
they're offering you

22:26.178 --> 22:28.214
-millions of dollars.
-I don't want millions.

22:28.247 --> 22:29.482
I--I want my job back.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.217
That was the whole point
in us doing this.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.386
But you'd be a millionaire.
Congratulations.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.987
You never have to have
a job again.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.390
Yeah, I didn't do this
for money.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.693
I did this so that I could
go back to doing what I love.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.862
To be back with my team.

22:42.895 --> 22:46.032
(chuckles)

22:46.065 --> 22:50.336
Uh, you really think they're
gonna welcome you back, kid?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.038
I mean, not to
toot my own horn,

22:52.071 --> 22:54.774
but I raked your friends
over the coals pretty hard.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.777
Wait, I told you that stuff,
not so that you would use it,

22:57.810 --> 22:59.278
it was just information.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.581
What happened to
attorney-client privilege?

23:01.614 --> 23:03.215
Okay, that doesn't work
how you think it does.

23:03.249 --> 23:07.353
But I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.889
We won.
Maybe not how you wanted, but--

23:09.922 --> 23:11.958
Well, this doesn't
feel like winning.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.761
But it's probably as close
as you're ever gonna get.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.631
So what do you wanna do?

23:26.973 --> 23:29.108
MAY: What are you doing
to my dad?

23:29.141 --> 23:30.276
MARTIN: Miss, get back
in the vehicle.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.444
MICHAEL
May, get back in the car.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.779
Okay, do what he says.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.080
MAY: No, they can't
just treat us like this.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.382
-REYNOLDS: Take her phone.
-MAY: No.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.884
-MARTIN: Back seat.
-MAY: No, no, stop!

23:37.917 --> 23:38.885
MARTIN:
Hands in the air!

23:38.918 --> 23:39.952
(shouting, struggling efforts)

23:39.986 --> 23:41.120
MAY: Stop! Stop!

23:41.153 --> 23:42.722
MARTIN:
Get back in the car, now!

23:42.755 --> 23:43.923
-MAY: Leave us alone!
-MICHAEL: Don't shoot my son!

23:43.956 --> 23:45.558
Don't you shoot my son!

23:45.592 --> 23:49.395
Look, my wife is a sergeant.
Her name is Athena Grant.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.097
You sure you wanna watch that?

23:51.130 --> 23:54.400
I needed to see it
for myself.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.836
I'm gonna recommend suspension
without pay

23:56.869 --> 23:59.105
while the department conducts
their investigation.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.074
I'm gonna push
for disciplinary action.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.275
Most likely, there'll be

24:03.309 --> 24:05.177
no real consequences
for their actions?

24:05.211 --> 24:07.079
None that will
feel satisfying.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.116
Reynolds has
a long list of complaints.

24:11.684 --> 24:15.354
Excessive force,
unlawful search and seizure,

24:15.387 --> 24:17.089
violation of civil liberties.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.425
Yeah, the problem is
he always stops just short

24:19.458 --> 24:21.594
of doing something truly awful,
so none of it sticks.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.362
Well,
maybe it has something to do

24:23.395 --> 24:25.498
with who's making
the complaints.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.299
Almost every incident
on that list

24:27.333 --> 24:29.702
involves a black
or brown suspect.

24:29.736 --> 24:32.338
I'm aware of the pattern.

24:32.371 --> 24:33.773
But I'm not gonna lie to you,
Athena.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.375
This is probably
gonna go away, too.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.646
Yeah, for them.
But not for my family.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.581
Certainly not for me.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.320

25:02.669 --> 25:09.075

25:09.108 --> 25:10.309
Stock market's closed

25:10.342 --> 25:12.712
you don't need to check
your portfolio.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.714
I'm making sure Christopher
didn't text.

25:14.747 --> 25:15.715
He's not gonna text.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.349
He's having the time
of his life.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.384
You, on the other hand,

25:18.417 --> 25:19.719
are so amped
you can't see straight.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.221
What am I missing, anyways,
besides fake fight club.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.390
This is your idea
of helping me.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.558
You're a powder keg.

25:25.592 --> 25:28.160
You beat up a guy
over a parking space.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.228
But a place like this could be

25:29.261 --> 25:30.897
a healthy outlet
for your issues.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.165
(laughs)

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
What are you,
my therapist now?

25:34.734 --> 25:37.203
Just the chick
who bailed you out of jail.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.205
I thought we weren't
talking about that.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.440
FIGHT ORGANIZER:
Bosko! You're up!

25:43.542 --> 25:45.745
(laughs) Wait, wait.
You're fighting.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.047
I'm not the only one
with stuff to work out.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.882
Hold my beer.

25:49.916 --> 25:52.084

MICHAEL:
Thanks for dinner, Bobby.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.179
I really needed
to see my kids, you know?

26:53.212 --> 26:54.413
How are you doing?

26:54.446 --> 26:57.349
Ah, I'm still mad as hell.

26:57.383 --> 27:01.688
Me too. I thought
the world had changed.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.289
Or I guess I wanted
to believe it had.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.525
No, it's not just you.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.795
I got too comfortable.
You know,

27:08.828 --> 27:11.297
architect,
nice house, nice car,

27:11.330 --> 27:13.599
married to an LAPD sergeant.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.435
(chuckles)

27:16.468 --> 27:18.671
Formerly married.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.873
I thought I was exempt.

27:20.907 --> 27:24.543
And then I was reminded
that I'm not.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.814
And neither is my son.

27:27.847 --> 27:31.183
And that's the part that
I'm really struggling with.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.152
Because that's the promise
that we make, right?

27:33.185 --> 27:34.620
When we have kids--

27:34.653 --> 27:35.988
that their lives are gonna be

27:36.022 --> 27:38.024
better and easier
than ours were.

27:38.057 --> 27:41.360
Yeah, but Harry's ten.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.829
He shouldn't be worried
about anything,

27:42.862 --> 27:45.865
except for school, sports
and just being a kid.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.335
And now I have to sit him down
and talk to him.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.371
The talk.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.040
I have to prepare my son
for something

27:54.073 --> 27:56.475
that shouldn't even be
his responsibility.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.644
I'm sorry.
I wish I could say

27:58.677 --> 27:59.746
that I know
what you're feeling.

27:59.779 --> 28:03.182
No, brother, I'm so glad
that you don't.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.051
If it had been worse,

28:05.084 --> 28:06.418
if something would've happened
to me,

28:06.452 --> 28:08.921
I am so happy
that they have you

28:08.955 --> 28:12.759
because I know you love them
like they're your own.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.161
No, Michael. You can't
let yourself think like that.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.695
Yeah.

28:16.729 --> 28:20.032
Somehow, I can't seem to stop.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.035
(somber music)

28:23.069 --> 28:24.403
*

28:24.436 --> 28:25.571
MICHAEL: I need to talk to you

28:25.604 --> 28:28.007
about what happened
the other night.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.677
Do we have to?

28:31.710 --> 28:34.747
I know it was scary.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.048
But we need to talk about

28:36.082 --> 28:38.384
what I could've done
differently.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.551
You didn't do anything wrong.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.889
Well, it's not about
being right.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.124
Sometimes when you deal
with the police,

28:45.157 --> 28:47.126
it's about being safe.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.061
Aren't they supposed to
keep us safe?

28:49.095 --> 28:51.297
They are.

28:51.330 --> 28:55.067
But not all officers
are like your mom.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.703
There are some bad ones.

28:57.736 --> 29:01.540
And there are some
that aren't so bad.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.210
But some of them
will still treat you

29:04.243 --> 29:06.879
like you're different
than the other kids.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.916
Because I'm black?

29:09.949 --> 29:12.785
Yes, because you're black.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.390
So you need to know
what to do

29:18.424 --> 29:21.894
when you come in contact
with the police.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.496
Be respectful.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.733
Do what they say.

29:27.766 --> 29:32.271
And don't ever make them
feel nervous or panic.

29:32.304 --> 29:34.273
But they're the ones
with the guns.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.741
What if I'm more scared
than they are?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.344
You probably will be.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.947
But they might not
understand that.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.916
So you can't yell
or argue with them,

29:43.950 --> 29:46.285
even though you think
that you're right.

29:46.318 --> 29:50.789
And always keep your hands
where they can see them.

29:50.823 --> 29:55.261
No sudden moves.
Don't reach for anything. Ever.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.929
What if they ask me
for something?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.464
I don't have
a driver's license, but--

29:58.497 --> 30:02.134
Right. Well, then you ask them
for permission.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.036
Okay?

30:04.070 --> 30:06.338
And then you move very slowly

30:06.372 --> 30:08.807
and you tell them what
you're doing

30:08.841 --> 30:09.976
as you're doing it.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.979
Why are we different?

30:13.012 --> 30:13.980
We are not.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.948
But you just said--

30:15.982 --> 30:20.186
I said that some people
will see you differently.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.955
They will look at you
and judge you.

30:22.989 --> 30:27.726
But those people
will never know who you are.

30:27.759 --> 30:32.698
You are a smart, kind,

30:32.731 --> 30:36.668
beautiful black boy

30:36.702 --> 30:41.707
who's gonna grow up to be
an amazing black man.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.177
Be proud of that.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.514
Don't you ever forget.
Promise me.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.716
I promise.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.818
Good.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.053
I love you, Harry.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.088
I love you too, Dad.

30:56.122 --> 31:03.062
*

31:09.936 --> 31:12.905
(siren chirps, wails)

31:24.984 --> 31:27.553
(radio chatter)

31:27.586 --> 31:29.055
I'm a cop, I was ju--

31:29.088 --> 31:32.058
leaving your favorite
watering hole after shift?

31:32.091 --> 31:34.460
O'Neil's, right?

31:34.493 --> 31:37.629
License, registration
and proof of insurance.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.599
You gotta be kidding me.

31:42.768 --> 31:47.073
Turn off the engine.
Step out of the car for me.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.308
(grunts)

31:53.412 --> 31:55.381
How much you have
to drink tonight?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.749
-A couple of beers.
-What's a couple?

31:57.783 --> 32:00.886
Two? Twelve?

32:00.919 --> 32:04.156
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
do a field sobriety test.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.158
Legally, I can refuse that.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.427
And legally,
I can throw you in jail.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.828
Objective symptoms.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.730
Glassy-eyed,
smell like alcohol--

32:11.763 --> 32:15.401
since we being all
by the book now.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.802
Follow the pen.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.139
You don't give a damn
about a DUI.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.940
Careful, now.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.575
I've heard
talking back to an officer

32:23.609 --> 32:25.077
is liable to get someone
slammed up

32:25.111 --> 32:27.246
against the hood of a car,
even cuffed.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.848
Listen, Sergeant, I didn't know
that was your family

32:29.881 --> 32:31.017
when we made the stop.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.851
Oh, they were lucky, then.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.253
Somebody else's family,
and they could be

32:34.286 --> 32:36.255
making funeral arrangements
right now.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.857
Walk and turn.
You know the drill.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.860
(radio chatter)

32:41.893 --> 32:48.500
*

32:55.841 --> 32:58.544
It was all
a big misunderstanding.

32:58.577 --> 33:01.013
-I'm sorry if your family got--
-Keep your weak apology.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.481
Stand on one leg.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.056
Humiliating, isn't it?

33:10.089 --> 33:11.690
Being treated like a criminal.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.026
Singled out for no good reason.

33:14.060 --> 33:18.730
Harassed by a police officer
with questionable motives.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.166
I can report you.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.401
-This is retribution.
-If it was retribution,

33:22.434 --> 33:25.237
I would've done it
when your kids were in the car.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.575
I really am sorry, Sergeant.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.180
You have a nice night, then.

33:34.213 --> 33:41.087
*

33:53.232 --> 34:00.106
*

34:00.139 --> 34:01.540
Okay, listen up.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.710
Last couple times we were here,
mistakes were made.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.245
That is not gonna happen again.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.882
That is why I am pairing you up
on your assignments.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.784
Eddie, Lena,
you are on meats and deli.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.021
Nothing leaner than 92%

34:16.054 --> 34:18.389
Hen, Chimney, baking aisle.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.391
Unrefined flour this time.
Thank you.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.060
I will cover fruits
and vegetables.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.862
Once you have everything
on your list,

34:23.895 --> 34:25.731
we will reconvene
at the dairy case.

34:25.764 --> 34:27.399
Let's move!

34:27.433 --> 34:30.068
This must be what the invasion
of Normandy felt like.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.902
(laughs)

34:31.937 --> 34:33.905
What do you mean
he just dropped the charges?

34:33.938 --> 34:35.706
You make it sound like
you're disappointed.

34:35.741 --> 34:39.978
Just surprised.
Pleasantly.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.414
Apparently, that wasn't
the guy's first illegal fight.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.882
And they weighed that
against my service record--

34:44.916 --> 34:47.719
Captain America wins
a Get Out of Jail Free card?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.588
And anyway,
that jackass' knee surgery

34:49.621 --> 34:51.257
was three years ago.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.726
But not letting it go.
'Cause that's healthy.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.062
I just think
Bobby needs to let go

34:57.094 --> 34:58.730
of being pissed off at Buck.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.766
I know that,
and so does Bobby.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.234
How you figure?

35:02.268 --> 35:04.803
What do you think this whole
shopping trip is all about?

35:04.836 --> 35:06.772
-Buck.
-Exactly.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.940
It's just a distraction
to keep our minds off--

35:08.974 --> 35:11.143
No, no, no. Buck.

35:12.611 --> 35:16.682
Whoa, hey, uh, you guys.
What's up?

35:16.715 --> 35:19.351
-What are you doing here?
-Me, I'm just here to--

35:19.385 --> 35:21.287
to do some--
some shopping.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.988
Eight miles
from your apartment?

35:23.021 --> 35:25.857
Yeah, well, this is
the only place that has...

35:25.891 --> 35:27.859
Happy Cat laxative powder.

35:27.893 --> 35:31.263
You're buying cat laxative?

35:31.297 --> 35:34.966
Yeah, I've been thinking of,
uh, of getting a cat.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.670
And you're anticipating
your new cat will be irregular.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.673
Um--

35:41.707 --> 35:45.677
Listen, I--I came here
to apologize.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.313
Okay, I--I never meant
for things to get

35:47.346 --> 35:49.848
so out of hand
with the lawsuit and--

35:49.881 --> 35:51.983
Yeah? What'd you think
was gonna happen?

35:52.017 --> 35:54.052
The lawsuit's bad enough,
but you told your lawyer

35:54.085 --> 35:56.222
everything about us--
personal things.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.557
You're supposed to be truthful
with your lawyer.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.058
Why are you so pissed at me?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.327
Because you're exhausting.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.461
We all have our own problems,

36:02.494 --> 36:03.829
but you don't see us
whining about it.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.732
No, somehow,
we just manage to suck it up.

36:06.765 --> 36:08.066
Why can't you?

36:08.099 --> 36:09.968
That's kinda harsh.
It's not like the guy asked

36:10.001 --> 36:11.337
to be crushed
by a ladder truck.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.071
No, but he filed
a stupid lawsuit,

36:13.104 --> 36:14.740
and now I can't even
talk to you because of it.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.875
You know how much
Christopher misses you?

36:16.908 --> 36:19.010
How could you?
You're not around.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.312
-(people arguing outside)
-I--I didn't realize that.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.180
Maybe I can come
and visit Christopher.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.882
You know the lawsuit
doesn't prevent that.

36:23.915 --> 36:24.883
-(arguing continues outside)
-No, it prevents me

36:24.916 --> 36:26.151
from reaching out to you.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.720
I couldn't even call you
to bail me out of jail.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.556
MAN: You took my spot, man!

36:30.589 --> 36:32.391
If that was something
that happened.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.860
What--what?
What are you talking about?

36:34.893 --> 36:36.995
Look, man, why can't you see
my side of this?

36:37.028 --> 36:39.631
-'Cause that's all you see.
-(shouting, crashing)

36:40.732 --> 36:42.434
(crashing)

36:42.468 --> 36:44.703
-WOMAN: What's happening?
-Someone should stop her.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.338
These two or those two?

36:46.372 --> 36:48.507
-Let's go!
-(horn blaring)

36:48.540 --> 36:50.609
(crashing)

36:50.642 --> 36:53.044
(tires squealing,
horn honking)

36:53.078 --> 36:54.546
MAN: Hey! Get back here!

36:54.580 --> 36:56.415
(siren wails)

36:56.448 --> 36:59.418
(thrilling music)

36:59.451 --> 37:02.354
*

37:02.388 --> 37:04.022
(shouting)

37:04.055 --> 37:05.724
(horn honking)

37:05.757 --> 37:07.393
Eddie, Lena, get the tools.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.261
Hen, Chimney,
check on the drivers.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.230
(horn honking)

37:12.264 --> 37:15.301
(shouting, honking)

37:17.803 --> 37:20.071
MAN: I'm gonna die, man!

37:29.748 --> 37:31.249
Hey.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.887
Karen?
What's wrong?

37:35.921 --> 37:38.557
The doctor called...

37:38.590 --> 37:42.060
and none of the embryos
are good.

37:42.093 --> 37:47.065
Wh--What? We had six.
None?

37:47.098 --> 37:49.935
(clears throat)
It's just that they had, uh,

37:49.968 --> 37:54.973
chromosomal abnormalities
or defects.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.343
They have to be discarded.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.648
She did say we can try again.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.016
Maybe do better next time.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.520
Okay, so--
so we'll try again.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.489
But what if it fails again?

38:10.522 --> 38:13.124
I should've frozen my eggs
when I was younger,

38:13.158 --> 38:15.093
but I just kept thinking
there was time.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.628
No, don't--don't do this.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.164
Don't put this on yourself,
Karen.

38:19.197 --> 38:20.866
But it is on me.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.301
-I'm so sorry.
-No, no.

38:23.335 --> 38:25.704
No, this is not your fault.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.475
You did everything
exactly right.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.444
Every test, every treatment.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.313
Every doctor's order,
you followed it to the letter.

38:35.347 --> 38:38.116
Yeah, and my body
has been fighting me

38:38.149 --> 38:40.952
every step of the way.

38:40.986 --> 38:43.221
Fighting me.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.391
The IVF, the IUI,

38:45.424 --> 38:48.627
the complications
and the side effects, and--

38:48.660 --> 38:52.197
It's--it's trying
to tell me something.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.334
Give up.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.505
-Maybe I should listen.
-No.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.707
(sobs)

39:01.740 --> 39:05.377
-I'm sorry.
-No. No.

39:05.411 --> 39:10.181
-KAREN: I'm so sorry.
-HEN: Don't be.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.551
Don't be.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.392
Sergeant Grant?

39:20.426 --> 39:22.761
I--I'm Officer Andrew Martin.

39:22.794 --> 39:23.895
I was on the scene
the other night

39:23.929 --> 39:25.063
for your family's traffic stop.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.865
Oh, yeah.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.900
I'm familiar with your work.

39:28.934 --> 39:30.702
I just want you to know
how sorry I am.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.038
I--I didn't see your son
in the backseat.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.541
And then it was instinct.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.242
A bad one.

39:37.275 --> 39:38.844
When we say
"protect and serve,"

39:38.877 --> 39:42.881
we mean the community,
not ourselves.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.916
I remember being a rookie.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.252
The nerves, not knowing
what you're walking up on,

39:47.285 --> 39:48.720
not sure what to do
when you get there.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.890
It's natural to follow
your partner's lead.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.560
Just don't follow it
off a cliff.

39:54.593 --> 39:59.397
*

39:59.431 --> 40:01.232
Do better.

40:01.266 --> 40:05.236
*

40:05.270 --> 40:07.372
(rock music playing)

40:07.405 --> 40:10.275
So this is your idea
of a team-building activity?

40:10.308 --> 40:12.544
BOBBY: Well, trust falls
are part of the job.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.547
I can't fix the world.
I can't offer some sage advice

40:15.581 --> 40:17.916
that's gonna
make everything better.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.519
All I can offer is this.

40:24.956 --> 40:29.995
-I cannot believe you came.
-Rough day.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.264
I really need
to break something right now.

40:33.298 --> 40:35.100
What's that?

40:35.133 --> 40:37.402
Cap sprung for
the deluxe package.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.004
Full minibar!

40:39.037 --> 40:41.106
They serve alcohol
in this place?

40:41.139 --> 40:43.775
Oh, yeah. I'm surprised we
don't get more calls from here.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.747
Well, it looks like you have
some more team building to do.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.616
(glass shatters)

40:51.883 --> 40:52.951
Yeah.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.423
Hey, uh, hey, Bobby.

40:58.456 --> 41:02.628
Thank you for...inviting me.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.362
Look, I--I just wanted
to apologize.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.097
You're gonna get
a call tomorrow from the Chief.

41:06.131 --> 41:07.866
You're being reinstated
to active duty.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.868
The brass didn't want
the headache.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.537
They're afraid
of the bad press.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.105
Well--(laughs)
That--that's awesome.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.207
Yeah, maybe not.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.109
They gave me the option
to transfer you.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.145
They understood how
I might not want you back

41:20.178 --> 41:21.713
after everything
you put us through.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.281
But I said no.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.950
You're coming back to the 118

41:24.983 --> 41:28.486
where I can keep an eye on you.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.221
Thanks, Captain.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.323
-You won't regret it.
-You might.

41:32.357 --> 41:34.993
My house, my rules.
Remember that?

41:35.026 --> 41:40.131
*

41:40.165 --> 41:42.033
EDDIE:
Rage is defined as an intense

41:42.067 --> 41:43.569
or violent type of anger.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.571
(screams)

41:45.604 --> 41:47.673
SINGER: * Ohh

41:47.706 --> 41:52.043
EDDIE: Road rage, office rage,
even airplane rage.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.379
SINGER:
* This time I won't let go

41:54.412 --> 41:55.647
EDDIE: Seems like
the whole world

41:55.681 --> 41:58.149
is on the edge
of snapping lately.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.219
But it's not the only way
we use that word.

42:01.252 --> 42:03.722
A raging fire.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.491
A raging storm.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.927
A rager of a party.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.430
All things
that are out of control.

42:12.463 --> 42:16.101
And maybe that's where
our rage comes from.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.871
A feeling that our world,
our lives

42:19.905 --> 42:21.372
are out of control.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.174
-REYNOLDS: I said don't move!
-MICHAEL: Okay, okay!

42:23.208 --> 42:27.212
EDDIE:
When we feel helpless...

42:27.245 --> 42:29.581
powerless...

42:29.615 --> 42:31.482
weak...

42:35.420 --> 42:38.523
(panting)
Hey, where's Eddie?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.958
LENA:
He said he had other plans.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.561
(cheering)

42:43.595 --> 42:46.464
(grunting)

42:48.600 --> 42:52.237
-(grunts)
-(cheering)

42:52.270 --> 42:54.873
SINGER: * Ohh

42:54.906 --> 42:57.876
(grunts)

42:57.909 --> 43:02.047
SINGER:
* This time I won't let go

43:02.080 --> 43:04.549
EDDIE:
The rage starts to build,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.551
and it needs an outlet.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.055
So what happens
when we let it take over?

43:10.088 --> 43:13.491
Do we regain control
by unleashing our fury?

43:15.260 --> 43:18.163
Or have we crossed a line
we can't come back from?

44:00.505 --> 44:02.040
ANNOUNCER: Don't miss
a minute of 9-1-1.

44:02.073 --> 44:04.676
