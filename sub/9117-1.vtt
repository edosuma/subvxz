00:56.246 --> 00:58.747
You want to tell me
what this is all about?

00:59.816 --> 01:02.019
I mean, if you want
me to protect this,

01:02.020 --> 01:03.954
don't you want me
to know what it is?

01:03.955 --> 01:05.388
- No, I don't.
- Okay.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.257
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

01:07.258 --> 01:10.994
In all due respect, why don't
you just hire the FedEx?

01:10.995 --> 01:13.028
Because I'm hiring you, Jack.

01:13.930 --> 01:18.335
You want me to pick up this bag and
bring it to you, and that's it?

01:18.336 --> 01:21.838
I want to pay you an
exorbitant amount of money

01:21.839 --> 01:24.540
to get the bag and bring it to me.

01:30.947 --> 01:32.983
I don't get it. Why me?

01:32.984 --> 01:35.351
Jesus Christ. Look.

01:42.092 --> 01:43.659
This is me.

01:44.394 --> 01:46.195
This is you.

01:46.897 --> 01:48.063
This is the money.

01:51.034 --> 01:52.468
This is the bag.

01:53.770 --> 01:55.706
You go and get the bag.

01:55.707 --> 01:57.307
And now, Jack,
this is vitally important.

01:57.308 --> 02:01.044
You do not look in this bag.
You do not open this bag.

02:01.045 --> 02:04.247
You don't even take a
little peek in this bag.

02:04.248 --> 02:07.349
The contents of this
bag are off-limits.

02:07.384 --> 02:08.752
Understood?

02:08.752 --> 02:10.120
Okay, I get it.

02:10.121 --> 02:13.489
And you bring this bag to me.

02:15.892 --> 02:19.194
And I give you the money.

02:21.965 --> 02:23.365
Clear?

03:33.270 --> 03:34.871
Yeah, hello.

03:34.872 --> 03:36.006
How'd it go?

03:36.007 --> 03:38.341
Your man, Bishop, tried to kill me.

03:38.342 --> 03:39.976
Regardless, we stick to the plan.

03:39.977 --> 03:41.311
<i>What do you mean,
"We stick to the plan"?</i>

03:41.312 --> 03:43.380
I'm telling you your
man tried to whack me

03:43.381 --> 03:44.548
and you're telling me
you still want me to go

03:44.549 --> 03:46.550
to this shitty motel in
the middle of nowhere

03:46.551 --> 03:48.118
and sit around and wait
for you all night?

03:48.119 --> 03:50.086
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

03:50.087 --> 03:51.521
How do I know there's not somebody
else waiting for me at the motel?

03:51.522 --> 03:52.889
Jack, calm down.

03:52.890 --> 03:56.026
I'm calm... I'm calling
you from a payphone

03:56.027 --> 03:59.362
because he shot the fucking
cell phone out of my hand.

03:59.363 --> 04:00.997
He put a fucking
bullet in my hand...

04:00.998 --> 04:03.166
<i>You didn't look in the bag, did you?</i>

04:03.167 --> 04:04.968
No, I didn't look in the bag.

04:04.969 --> 04:06.436
You stick to the plan.

04:06.437 --> 04:08.538
Yes. We stick to the plan.
<i>Room 13.</i>

04:08.539 --> 04:10.372
Room 13.

04:15.078 --> 04:16.745
Bishop, let's go.

04:23.053 --> 04:24.955
You couldn't stick to
the plan, could you?

04:24.956 --> 04:27.456
No! You shoot a guy in the hand.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.681
Come on.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.235
Can I help you?

06:19.236 --> 06:21.403
Yeah. I need a room, please.

06:21.604 --> 06:22.771
Okay.

06:23.606 --> 06:24.708
How long you'll be staying?

06:24.709 --> 06:26.376
One night.

06:26.377 --> 06:28.043
Just for one night? Okay.
Yeah.

06:29.079 --> 06:32.814
I'll need you to fill this out.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.817
And I need to see a credit card.

06:36.419 --> 06:37.754
I'll be paying in cash.

06:37.755 --> 06:40.023
Excuse me?

06:40.024 --> 06:41.957
I said, "I'll be paying in cash."

06:42.359 --> 06:43.725
Okay.

06:44.561 --> 06:47.396
I need you to fill out this card

06:48.331 --> 06:51.533
and that'll be $65 plus tax.

06:53.103 --> 06:54.469
What happened?

06:55.372 --> 06:57.273
- What?
- Your hand is bleeding.

06:57.274 --> 06:59.209
Oh.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.244
I got into a fight with my wife.

07:01.245 --> 07:03.246
She stabbed me with a steak knife.
She lunged at me.

07:03.247 --> 07:06.182
Maybe you should go to a
hospital and get that looked at.

07:06.183 --> 07:07.417
No, I'm fine.

07:07.418 --> 07:08.752
I can call 'em if you'd like.

07:08.753 --> 07:11.086
No, it's all right.
That's not necessary.

07:11.654 --> 07:13.489
- It could be infected.
- It's not.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.592
Might be infected
and not even know.

07:15.593 --> 07:17.926
I said, "It's fine."
Please.

07:24.601 --> 07:26.735
Fill out this card.

07:29.339 --> 07:31.073
And this one, too.
Both of them.

07:32.108 --> 07:34.044
- You're Bob Smith.
- Yeah.

07:34.045 --> 07:35.811
- From Pittsburgh?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:36.546 --> 07:39.481
You're gonna be in room number 6.

07:40.216 --> 07:44.154
I want room 13, please.

07:44.155 --> 07:45.887
- 13?
- Yeah.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.695
Not many people ask for room 13.

07:52.696 --> 07:55.498
So it's available, yeah?

07:55.499 --> 07:57.267
Was you asked to ask
for that number?

07:57.268 --> 07:59.302
Asked to ask?

07:59.303 --> 08:01.136
- Were you?
- I'm asking you.

08:01.671 --> 08:03.372
Room 13.

08:04.808 --> 08:07.028
It's my lucky number.
I'm a contrarian, you know?

08:09.179 --> 08:11.813
You're either a
contrarian or you're a victim.

08:12.515 --> 08:14.651
You'll be in room number 13.

08:14.652 --> 08:16.419
That's not an interconnecting room.

08:16.420 --> 08:17.821
Interconnecting?

08:17.822 --> 08:19.489
You can't go from one
room to the next

08:19.490 --> 08:21.091
without going outside of the door.

08:21.092 --> 08:23.259
Is that all right with you?
I don't give a fuck.

08:23.260 --> 08:26.629
All right! You'll be in room number 13.
You can drive on down there.

08:26.630 --> 08:28.096
Park by it if you'd like.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.123
Hey!

10:03.560 --> 10:04.926
Excuse me.

10:16.539 --> 10:18.942
The phone in my room is dead.

10:18.943 --> 10:20.343
The line is dead.

10:20.344 --> 10:21.977
Oh, that's

10:22.512 --> 10:24.746
because it's not turned on.

10:25.448 --> 10:26.716
Could you turn it on, please?

10:26.717 --> 10:29.986
Well, in order for me
to turn on the phone

10:29.987 --> 10:31.854
or any incidentals,

10:31.855 --> 10:34.990
I'll need an impression
of a major credit card.

10:35.525 --> 10:36.893
I'll give you cash.

10:36.894 --> 10:41.196
I'm sorry, but I'm going to
need to see a credit card.

10:42.665 --> 10:46.436
I just told you I'll
give you some cash.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.839
If you want to let me charge
you for the telephone calls

10:49.840 --> 10:52.240
I'm going to need to
get an impression

10:53.409 --> 10:54.844
of a credit card.

10:54.845 --> 10:59.014
Even if you wanted
to get extra towels,

10:59.649 --> 11:01.417
I'm going to need to see that card.

11:01.418 --> 11:03.552
I don't have a credit card.

11:05.255 --> 11:07.055
Here's another $100.

11:08.391 --> 11:10.859
That's $400 cash.

11:18.801 --> 11:21.904
Here's another.
Here's another $100.

11:24.607 --> 11:26.207
Turn the phone on for me?

11:27.043 --> 11:28.344
I can take the cash.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.280
Okay.

11:30.281 --> 11:32.747
Seeing as that you don't
have a credit card.

11:33.816 --> 11:37.487
And if you can just wait a minute,

11:37.488 --> 11:41.457
I will write you a receipt and
then I can turn on the phone.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.693
You let me know if there's
any trouble with the line

11:43.694 --> 11:45.895
because we just had
some work done on it.

11:45.896 --> 11:48.431
I don't know why.
It seemed okay to me.

11:48.432 --> 11:51.700
They said otherwise the whole
place could go up in smoke.

11:53.002 --> 11:55.438
That's what they said.

11:55.439 --> 11:57.707
- Your hand feeling any better?
- Yes.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.174
That's good.

12:01.444 --> 12:04.447
Is there anything else that I can
do to help you this evening?

12:04.448 --> 12:05.814
No.

12:08.618 --> 12:10.652
Have a good night.

12:15.958 --> 12:17.393
Hey, man.

12:17.394 --> 12:18.727
Got a match?

12:20.396 --> 12:21.597
No.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.066
Why not?

12:23.067 --> 12:25.266
Why don't you have a match?

12:42.418 --> 12:43.652
Hello?

12:46.422 --> 12:47.789
Yes.

12:49.359 --> 12:51.026
That's fine.

12:52.061 --> 12:54.929
Yeah, that's fine. I'll be waiting.

13:33.803 --> 13:35.471
Sorry to bother you.
I was wondering

13:35.472 --> 13:37.252
if you had a corkscrew
I could borrow.

13:38.074 --> 13:39.240
No.

13:40.610 --> 13:42.310
Sorry to disturb you.

15:15.171 --> 15:17.206
I said, "Wait here,
bitch, till I get back."

15:17.207 --> 15:18.941
How long are we going
to stay in this place?

15:18.942 --> 15:20.776
Until I do what I got to do!

15:20.777 --> 15:22.111
I don't wanna be a part of this.

15:22.112 --> 15:25.914
Shut your mouth and get your ass in
there. I said I got business. Now, go!

16:58.941 --> 17:01.377
To tell you the truth, Janet,

17:01.378 --> 17:03.813
I'm more annoyed at
myself than I am at you.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.282
I like to think of myself
as being a reasonably savvy

17:07.284 --> 17:10.886
person who can appraise the
value, the fabric if you will,

17:10.887 --> 17:13.288
of the people who work for me.

17:13.929 --> 17:14.723
Jesus Christ!

17:14.724 --> 17:18.227
You'd think I'd have a goddamn
notepad in this office, wouldn't ya?

17:18.228 --> 17:20.395
Dragna, it was a mistake.

17:22.330 --> 17:25.635
You know something?
I don't like surprises. I never did.

17:25.636 --> 17:29.271
I never really enjoyed that
whole <i>Pop Goes The Wease</i> lthing.

17:29.272 --> 17:31.674
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the unexpected.

17:31.675 --> 17:34.176
And, in fact, I'd say I'm a
connoisseur of the unexpected.

17:34.177 --> 17:36.345
But I don't like surprises.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.606
Do you understand the
distinction I'm making here?

17:39.015 --> 17:40.750
Yes.

17:40.751 --> 17:43.018
But I don't think you understand
what I'm saying. I don't...

17:43.019 --> 17:44.152
Oh!

17:45.321 --> 17:46.722
Eureka!

17:46.723 --> 17:49.158
Dragna, I'm not a currency trader.

17:49.159 --> 17:51.227
You asked me to sit
in front of the screen

17:51.228 --> 17:53.328
because Melinda was
out with the flu.

17:55.765 --> 18:01.170
Do you know how hard it is to get
a mole in the Bank of Japan?

18:01.171 --> 18:03.305
Even the yakuza couldn't do it.
And you know why?

18:03.306 --> 18:05.406
Because they're savages.

18:06.175 --> 18:08.343
- I can't find a pen in this office.
- Everybody was yelling.

18:08.344 --> 18:12.380
I got confused. I pressed the buy
button instead of the sell button.

18:16.318 --> 18:18.988
Just before the Bank of
Japan flooded the market

18:18.989 --> 18:21.622
with Yen to weaken their currency.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.025
Hmm.

19:29.759 --> 19:31.761
The name I just wrote,

19:31.762 --> 19:33.229
go see that guy.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.297
He's the best plastic
surgeon in New York.

19:35.298 --> 19:37.099
And you could pick
any nose you want.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.934
Your old one.

19:38.935 --> 19:41.337
Audrey Hepburn,
Beyonce, Barbra Streisand.

19:41.338 --> 19:43.337
Whatever the hell you want.

19:43.906 --> 19:46.074
My plane's here so I'm off.

19:47.042 --> 19:50.578
Janet, no more surprises, okay?

21:11.994 --> 21:15.564
Hi. Could I stay here for a while?
Please! Just until they leave.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.764
Get up.

21:17.132 --> 21:19.267
I said, "Get up"!

21:20.236 --> 21:21.971
Please, I can't go out there.

21:21.972 --> 21:23.606
- Get out.
- He's crazy. He'll kill me.

21:23.607 --> 21:25.040
Are you deaf? Get out!

21:25.041 --> 21:27.221
They're out of their minds.
Him and that midget.

21:27.643 --> 21:29.311
Move. Move.

21:29.312 --> 21:31.614
Please, mister,
I can't go out there.

21:31.615 --> 21:33.714
They're going to fucking kill me.
Please.

21:35.284 --> 21:37.685
What if I told them
what's under your bed?

21:39.255 --> 21:40.589
What did you say?

21:40.590 --> 21:43.791
What if I told them
what's under your bed?

21:59.174 --> 22:00.910
Did you look in that bag?

22:00.911 --> 22:02.278
No, I did not.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.445
Bullshit! What do you want?

22:05.447 --> 22:08.651
I just want to stay here
until they leave, okay?

22:08.652 --> 22:10.851
Who do you work for?

22:12.221 --> 22:15.057
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You think I'm stupid?

22:20.562 --> 22:21.729
Hello?

22:22.932 --> 22:24.232
Hold on a minute.

22:25.567 --> 22:27.768
Get up. Go in the bathroom.

22:29.038 --> 22:30.871
Okay. Look, I'm going.

22:34.476 --> 22:36.278
Hello?

22:36.279 --> 22:37.681
<i>So you're still in room 13?</i>

22:37.682 --> 22:40.482
Listen, Dragna, I just wasted
two more of your guys.

22:40.483 --> 22:43.452
- Why do you think they were my guys?
<i>- Feds on the payroll maybe.</i>

22:43.453 --> 22:45.621
They were the only wine
connoisseurs within 100 miles

22:45.622 --> 22:47.556
and what were they doing up my ass?

22:47.557 --> 22:49.291
Seems like you should be on Prozac.

22:49.292 --> 22:51.126
<i>No, I don't need Prozac.</i>

22:51.127 --> 22:52.294
Or AndroGel.

22:52.295 --> 22:53.661
<i>I need my goddamn money.</i>

22:54.697 --> 22:57.531
I need my goddamn
money right now.

22:58.233 --> 22:59.854
I need what you owe me.

23:00.269 --> 23:01.869
Hello?

23:13.148 --> 23:15.316
You could knock, you know?

23:17.753 --> 23:19.720
Thank you.

23:41.377 --> 23:43.844
Could I have a shot of that?

23:44.747 --> 23:46.514
No.

23:49.184 --> 23:50.686
So what are you going to do?

23:50.687 --> 23:52.154
About what?

23:52.155 --> 23:54.189
Sounds like you're in trouble.

23:54.190 --> 23:56.325
Maybe I can help.

23:56.326 --> 23:58.559
Go sit down over there.

24:00.362 --> 24:03.599
Well, anyway, I just want to thank
you for letting me stay here.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.136
Hey. I'm not doing you
any favors, okay?

24:07.137 --> 24:09.138
You're staying in here 'cause you
put your nose in my business

24:09.139 --> 24:11.073
where it does not belong.

24:11.074 --> 24:14.109
And now I don't want you leaving
until I leave this place.

24:14.110 --> 24:15.778
Do you understand?

24:15.779 --> 24:17.513
What the fuck were you
doing coming in here

24:17.514 --> 24:19.415
looking through my shit anyway?

24:19.416 --> 24:21.583
I didn't come in here to
look through your shit.

24:21.584 --> 24:24.153
Well, what were you
doing in here, then?

24:24.154 --> 24:25.587
I told you.

24:25.588 --> 24:28.090
He was going to kill me.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.591
Well, that's not my problem.

24:29.592 --> 24:32.493
I know it's my problem. I'm sorry.

24:37.332 --> 24:40.235
To be truthful, I did look
inside your briefcase.

24:40.236 --> 24:41.437
What the fuck?

24:41.438 --> 24:43.138
There was only an envelope.
Okay.

24:43.139 --> 24:44.672
Get it out! Show me!

25:15.637 --> 25:18.173
Did you look inside this bag?

25:18.174 --> 25:20.209
No, I told you already.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.810
- Did you look inside this bag?
- No.

25:26.248 --> 25:28.149
Why the fuck should I believe you?

25:34.723 --> 25:37.658
Are you all right?

25:38.327 --> 25:40.395
I can help you if you want.

25:40.396 --> 25:42.430
Get out, bitch!

25:42.831 --> 25:44.566
Bring your ass out here!

25:44.567 --> 25:45.868
You fucking skank!

25:45.869 --> 25:47.803
Where are you?

25:47.804 --> 25:50.671
I'm not playing these
games with you.

25:53.342 --> 25:55.444
- What happened?
- I got shot.

25:55.445 --> 25:57.446
- In the hand?
- Yeah.

25:57.447 --> 26:00.149
Why?
Because I'm lucky like that.

26:00.150 --> 26:02.750
Did they miss your heart
or they couldn't find it?

26:08.690 --> 26:11.025
A little trick I learned
on the streets.

26:12.361 --> 26:13.994
What street?

26:18.367 --> 26:20.067
Take a deep breath.

26:25.808 --> 26:27.708
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

26:30.646 --> 26:32.314
You must be great at
fucking parties, huh?

26:35.717 --> 26:37.252
There's no sign of her.

26:37.253 --> 26:38.820
This is bullshit!

26:38.821 --> 26:40.923
I don't know what crazy
shit she gonna pull next.

26:40.924 --> 26:43.958
I got solutions.
Cruel and permanent ones.

26:46.695 --> 26:49.063
Don't always think
about with your dick.

26:54.937 --> 26:57.171
I think that's them.
You think?

27:04.379 --> 27:07.281
I'm looking for a girl. A tall girl.
You seen a girl around here?

27:07.916 --> 27:09.516
No, I didn't see anybody.

27:09.617 --> 27:12.688
About 6-foot walking around looking
like Wonder Woman, and shit.

27:12.889 --> 27:14.690
You sure you haven't seen her?

27:14.691 --> 27:16.725
I just told you.
I didn't see anybody.

27:16.726 --> 27:18.727
You couldn't miss her.
She's so tall.

27:18.728 --> 27:22.564
Legs so long they go up and
make an ass of themselves.

27:22.565 --> 27:24.198
But you wouldn't know nothin'
about that, would you?

27:24.499 --> 27:26.000
No, I wouldn't.

27:26.602 --> 27:27.769
No, you wouldn't?

27:27.770 --> 27:29.338
No.
Hmm.

27:29.339 --> 27:31.705
Yo, that slut ain't anywhere.

27:31.974 --> 27:33.574
Hold up.

27:34.276 --> 27:37.312
Let me ask you a question.

27:37.313 --> 27:40.047
If you could fuck one woman
in history, who would it be?

27:41.016 --> 27:43.352
Hmm?

27:43.353 --> 27:46.688
I'd fuck Eve and I'd
make Adam watch.

27:46.689 --> 27:49.857
Flip his bitch over, fuck her in the
ass right in the Garden of Eden.

27:53.295 --> 27:55.876
What's the matter?
You don't like no pussy from the Bible?

28:00.302 --> 28:01.835
Come on, man.

28:12.414 --> 28:14.449
So now what?

28:14.450 --> 28:15.684
Now what, what?

28:15.685 --> 28:17.719
What do we do now? What's our plan?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.455
Our plan? What the fuck
are you talking about?

28:20.456 --> 28:22.155
Maybe I should just grab my bag.

28:22.156 --> 28:24.992
I told you. You ain't going nowhere.
Just sit down and be quiet.

28:25.927 --> 28:27.763
In here or the bathroom?

28:27.764 --> 28:29.897
Whatever you want.
I don't care.

29:00.729 --> 29:04.898
How'd you get, I don't know, involved
with those two circus freaks?

29:05.567 --> 29:06.735
I met Lizard in a strip bar.

29:06.736 --> 29:08.103
Which one's Lizard?

29:08.104 --> 29:10.372
The one with the eye patch.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.806
Oh. Are you a stripper?

29:11.807 --> 29:13.173
No.

29:13.675 --> 29:15.610
Well, not anymore. I stopped.

29:15.611 --> 29:17.779
It was just like, a part-time job.

29:17.780 --> 29:21.516
What are you now?
A schoolteacher, a superhero?

29:21.517 --> 29:26.153
You mean for work? Because I'm
kind of between jobs right now.

29:27.389 --> 29:28.790
Of course you are.

29:28.791 --> 29:31.659
Yeah. I'm trying to
find my true passion.

29:33.128 --> 29:34.596
How old are you?

29:34.597 --> 29:37.966
- How old do you want me to be?
- I don't give a fuck, sweetheart.

29:37.967 --> 29:40.134
- Twenty.
- Bullshit!

29:41.436 --> 29:43.136
All right, so how'd
you end up here?

29:43.972 --> 29:46.608
I'm from Israel, originally.

29:46.609 --> 29:49.144
I'm not asking for your entire life
history... What do you mean, "Israel"?

29:49.145 --> 29:52.146
- You don't sound like you're from Israel.
- Yeah, but I like Israel.

29:53.148 --> 29:54.883
But you're not from there.

29:54.884 --> 29:56.817
Doesn't matter.
I like Israel.

30:02.491 --> 30:03.791
I love Israel.

30:07.529 --> 30:10.653
All right. Um...
Just do me a favor.

30:10.654 --> 30:13.123
Tell me where you were
directly before you were here?

30:14.736 --> 30:16.336
Florida.

30:16.438 --> 30:18.106
And why here?

30:18.107 --> 30:20.842
Because this is where the
motherfucker stopped.

30:20.843 --> 30:22.744
Who's the Russian by the way?

30:22.745 --> 30:24.146
That's Lizard's connection.

30:24.147 --> 30:25.747
Connection for what?

30:25.748 --> 30:27.182
Could I have a shot of that?

30:27.183 --> 30:28.482
Sure.

30:29.017 --> 30:30.484
Connection for what?

30:31.620 --> 30:33.754
Can I have a glass, please?

30:44.533 --> 30:45.866
Connection for what?

30:46.501 --> 30:47.602
Crystal meth.

30:47.603 --> 30:48.837
You're dealing?

30:48.838 --> 30:50.505
I'm not dealing anything.

30:50.506 --> 30:53.442
- Is that what you're on right now?
- I'm not on anything.

30:53.443 --> 30:56.323
- You seem like you're on something.
- You seem like you're on something!

30:58.180 --> 30:59.848
Go in the bathroom.
Why can't I stay out here?

30:59.849 --> 31:01.183
Because I want you in the bathroom.

31:01.184 --> 31:03.404
Go in there and close the
door right now, please.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.754
Lock the door.

31:09.758 --> 31:11.593
Hello?

31:11.594 --> 31:12.961
Where are you?

31:12.962 --> 31:15.230
Where do you think I am,
Harvey? You called me.

31:15.231 --> 31:17.064
- Room 13?
- Yeah.

31:17.132 --> 31:18.332
Room 13.

31:18.333 --> 31:21.802
<i>Do you want me to ask you
what he asked me to ask you?</i>

31:22.971 --> 31:25.574
Yes. I want you to ask me
what he asked you to ask me.

31:25.575 --> 31:27.709
You have a Kindle or an iPad?

31:27.710 --> 31:29.478
No, I don't have a
Kindle or an iPad.

31:29.479 --> 31:30.612
<i>Have you read Hermann Hesse?</i>

31:30.613 --> 31:31.680
Who's Hermann Hesse?

31:31.681 --> 31:32.747
I'm not a library, Jack.

31:32.748 --> 31:33.915
When is he coming here?

31:33.916 --> 31:36.485
When he shows.

31:36.486 --> 31:37.919
Just tell me when the fuck
he's going to be here, man!

31:37.920 --> 31:40.387
<i>When he shows for crying out loud!</i>

32:19.995 --> 32:21.862
Get out here.

32:24.199 --> 32:26.868
It would have been easy if I
had just stayed out here.

32:26.869 --> 32:29.369
Okay, things have changed,

32:30.639 --> 32:32.073
and you're free to go.

32:32.074 --> 32:34.308
I won't go very far
with those two outside.

32:36.211 --> 32:37.477
Yeah.

32:40.315 --> 32:41.481
Okay.

32:43.051 --> 32:45.587
Here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to take you to a bus station,

32:45.588 --> 32:47.722
I'm gonna give you some money,
I'm gonna put you on a bus, all right?

32:47.723 --> 32:49.056
- When?
- Right now.

32:55.030 --> 32:56.363
Why?

33:02.737 --> 33:06.273
What do you mean, "Why?"
You want to go or not?

33:06.775 --> 33:08.610
Not.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.612
You don't want to get out of here?
You don't want to go home?

33:10.613 --> 33:12.412
I have no reason to.

33:15.216 --> 33:17.285
Well, tough shit.
You got to go.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.254
Why do you want me to go?

33:19.255 --> 33:21.021
Don't ask stupid questions.

33:24.359 --> 33:26.226
Okay.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.042
So, is Dragna coming
to pick up the bag?

33:41.043 --> 33:42.377
Hey!
You don't mention his name.

33:42.378 --> 33:45.313
All right?
You don't even think his fucking name!

33:45.314 --> 33:48.016
Forget you know anything about this shit.
Do you understand?

33:48.017 --> 33:49.951
How can I forget something
I already know?

33:49.952 --> 33:52.354
Listen, I'm going to drive you to that
bus station, get you on that bus.

33:52.355 --> 33:54.889
You're gonna forget you know
anything about this shit.

33:54.890 --> 33:57.057
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

34:09.105 --> 34:11.972
So what kind of trouble are you in?

34:15.377 --> 34:18.482
Why are you so nosy?

34:19.208 --> 34:21.079
- Why?
- I'm just curious.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.983
No, seriously, why would you do that?
Why are you like that?

34:23.351 --> 34:25.186
'Cause I'm just trying to have
a civilized conversation.

34:25.187 --> 34:27.822
No, you're not.
Why are you so nosy?

34:27.822 --> 34:29.891
I'm curious.

34:29.891 --> 34:31.513
You know what that did to the cat.

34:35.230 --> 34:38.165
So what's up with the
blood in your car?

34:41.268 --> 34:42.337
All over the backseat.

34:42.338 --> 34:44.272
It's from my hand, yeah.

34:44.273 --> 34:45.940
It's not from your hand.

34:45.940 --> 34:47.375
Hey, what did I just tell you?
What?

34:47.376 --> 34:49.310
About minding your own
fucking business?

34:49.311 --> 34:51.212
I am. There's blood all over
your car. I'm sorry, I can't...

34:51.213 --> 34:52.784
You know what? Let me
tell you something.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.748
Maybe there's gonna be more
fucking blood in this car

34:54.750 --> 34:57.952
if you don't shut your hole and
mind your own fucking business.

34:57.953 --> 34:59.287
It's none of your goddamn business.

34:59.288 --> 35:01.156
Well, I'm sorry for trying to help.

35:01.157 --> 35:04.157
Hey, just do me a favor, okay?
Don't help.

35:08.229 --> 35:09.931
Can I ask you something?

35:09.932 --> 35:13.101
You wanna ask me something,
or everything under the sun?

35:13.102 --> 35:14.335
Why are you doing this?

35:14.336 --> 35:16.304
Why am I doing what?
Helping me?

35:16.305 --> 35:18.106
I'm not helping you.
I am not helping you.

35:18.107 --> 35:19.808
I'm getting you out of the way.

35:19.809 --> 35:22.069
However you want to look
at it, you're helping me.

35:23.144 --> 35:24.312
Whatever makes you happy.

35:24.313 --> 35:26.014
Stop being a dick
would make me happy.

35:26.015 --> 35:28.215
Okay. You know what?

35:31.219 --> 35:32.754
Get out of the car.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.022
What the fuck is your problem?

35:34.023 --> 35:35.724
Get out of the fucking car,
okay? Get out!

35:35.725 --> 35:38.026
All right!

35:38.027 --> 35:39.928
Fucking asshole.
Here.

35:39.929 --> 35:43.096
There. Bus stop's a few miles away.
Good luck.

35:43.998 --> 35:46.066
- Fucking asshole.
- Bye-bye.

36:18.366 --> 36:20.267
Get in the car.

36:22.203 --> 36:24.105
- Get in the fucking car.
- No.

36:24.106 --> 36:25.540
Yes. Get in the fuckin...
No. No.

36:25.541 --> 36:26.740
Come on!

36:27.208 --> 36:28.842
Ow! Fuck!

36:40.121 --> 36:41.956
So who is that, huh?

36:41.957 --> 36:45.559
Is he a friend of, you know,
the person I can't say?

36:46.928 --> 36:49.063
Is that the guy who shot you?

36:55.970 --> 36:59.573
Why are you so curious, huh?
It's gonna get you killed one day.

37:00.341 --> 37:03.343
Oh... Fucking...
You're pathetic.

37:04.512 --> 37:07.445
What kind of idiot puts a body
in a trunk that can't close?

37:07.446 --> 37:08.448
Shut up.

37:08.449 --> 37:12.887
Shot in the head, huh?
What did he do?

37:15.190 --> 37:16.623
Fuck.

37:20.428 --> 37:22.163
We're fixing the tire.
Bend down. Bend down.

37:22.164 --> 37:23.744
We're fixing the tire.
Bend down.

37:25.967 --> 37:28.102
We can't just leave him in the trunk.
We have to get rid of it.

37:28.103 --> 37:29.504
Shut up.

37:29.505 --> 37:31.172
There's five gallons of
blood in your back seat.

37:31.173 --> 37:32.140
Somebody's going to see
it and call the police.

37:32.141 --> 37:33.507
Shut the fuck up.

37:40.014 --> 37:41.448
Ahh!

37:51.926 --> 37:53.760
What the hell is this?

37:54.529 --> 37:56.030
What, are you deaf?
I asked you a question.

37:56.031 --> 37:57.697
- What the hell is this?
- And you are?

37:59.869 --> 38:01.469
That's what you get
for messing with my woman.

38:01.470 --> 38:03.004
I'm not your woman.

38:03.005 --> 38:04.738
You shut your hole up.

38:05.473 --> 38:06.975
Pop him, man.

38:06.976 --> 38:08.142
Bobby, no.

38:08.143 --> 38:09.244
I said, "Shut up."

38:11.180 --> 38:14.082
I was hitching a ride and he pulled over.
He was just giving me a lift.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.950
He was giving you a lift?
Yeah, I bet he was giving you a lift.

38:26.895 --> 38:30.463
Are you fucking crazy?
Bitch, I wanna... I swear to God!

38:33.068 --> 38:35.370
Fuck it. I'll pop him.

38:35.371 --> 38:37.572
And afterwards, carry his body
into the woods and hide it.

38:37.573 --> 38:38.673
You carry him.

38:38.674 --> 38:40.441
- No, I'll shoot him.
- I'll shoot him.

38:40.442 --> 38:42.110
- I'll shoot him.
- Then you carry him.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.479
I should shoot your
little munchkin ass, too.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.313
Then you'd only have more to carry.

38:47.615 --> 38:50.585
Yeah, screw this, man.
Let's get out of here, man.

38:50.586 --> 38:53.021
Too much fucking trouble.

38:53.022 --> 38:56.624
Get your ass up.
Get up. Get over here.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.793
Are you crazy?
I'm not playing with you!

38:59.961 --> 39:01.461
Ahh!

39:05.167 --> 39:06.533
Pull up.

39:10.405 --> 39:11.905
Come here.
I got it. I got it.

39:13.975 --> 39:15.809
I'm gonna get the bag.

39:17.211 --> 39:19.879
Hold still. Hell's wrong with you?

39:24.519 --> 39:28.288
And I'm not Russian.
I'm Serbian-Roma, you fuck.

39:37.565 --> 39:39.833
Come on, man, let's go.

39:41.202 --> 39:42.936
I pissed on his fucking head.

39:47.575 --> 39:50.144
Shit, man.
Where's the goddamn keys at?

39:50.145 --> 39:53.847
Motherfuck.
Wanna be a freaking idiot?

39:54.716 --> 39:56.983
Yeah. I got your idiom.

40:14.669 --> 40:15.835
Hey.

40:17.505 --> 40:21.541
Hey. Hey. Curious cat.

40:22.276 --> 40:23.544
You all right?

40:47.035 --> 40:48.001
God...

40:54.409 --> 40:55.775
Ahh!

41:12.727 --> 41:14.394
Fuck.

41:26.307 --> 41:28.975
Oh, shit!

42:26.267 --> 42:27.335
Thank you.

42:27.336 --> 42:29.337
- Mr. Smith?
- Fuck.

42:30.672 --> 42:33.506
Just hold that there.

42:36.310 --> 42:37.545
Who is it?

42:37.546 --> 42:38.978
It's me, Mr. Smith.

42:39.380 --> 42:40.715
What do you want?

42:40.716 --> 42:42.850
Have you got a woman
in there with you?

42:42.851 --> 42:44.252
Oh.

42:45.587 --> 42:46.953
What?

42:49.323 --> 42:51.024
Mr. Smith.

42:52.393 --> 42:53.928
What do you want?

42:53.929 --> 42:56.155
'Cause if you have a
woman in there with you,

42:56.156 --> 42:58.666
I have to charge you $20
extra for double occupancy.

42:58.667 --> 43:00.119
I don't have a woman in here.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.203
I'm just saying, if you do have
a woman in there with you...

43:02.204 --> 43:04.238
Well, I don't.

43:04.239 --> 43:06.540
I'm just saying, if there was
someone in there with you...

43:06.541 --> 43:08.174
I don't have one in here.

43:09.343 --> 43:10.811
Now, listen to me.

43:10.812 --> 43:13.514
I wanna go to sleep now
because I'm very tired, okay?

43:13.515 --> 43:16.249
Good night. Good night.

43:17.785 --> 43:19.486
Good night.

43:35.436 --> 43:37.036
Don't fall asleep.

43:37.605 --> 43:38.940
Hey. Stay awake.

43:38.941 --> 43:40.273
I am awake.

43:41.909 --> 43:43.142
Oh, fuck.

43:48.516 --> 43:50.618
Quick. There was a candle in
here somewhere, wasn't there?

43:50.619 --> 43:53.186
Yeah. It's on top of the cabinet.

44:18.512 --> 44:19.714
Are you okay to move?

44:19.715 --> 44:21.616
Move where?

44:21.617 --> 44:25.019
Listen, Kitty Cat. Don't ask questions.
Are you okay to move or not?

44:25.020 --> 44:25.953
Not.

44:25.954 --> 44:27.788
Well...

44:27.789 --> 44:30.291
Look, even if you're not okay
to move, you're gonna go.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.392
Can you sit up?

44:31.393 --> 44:32.659
I mean...

44:37.298 --> 44:39.400
I don't understand.

44:39.401 --> 44:41.836
One minute you're all worried
about if I'm all right.

44:41.837 --> 44:44.070
The next minute you're
kicking me out?

44:44.805 --> 44:46.573
What are you, schizo?

44:47.475 --> 44:49.242
You sound like my ex.

44:50.544 --> 44:52.145
Let's go.

44:59.320 --> 45:01.856
Is it all right if I use the
bathroom before I go, master?

45:01.857 --> 45:03.056
Jesus Christ.

45:15.836 --> 45:17.670
Unbelievable.

45:40.528 --> 45:41.961
Hey.

45:44.732 --> 45:46.933
I got this from Lizard's car.

45:48.969 --> 45:51.639
It's the same picture
as the other one.

45:51.640 --> 45:54.008
That much I know.

45:54.009 --> 45:56.175
So we know as much as each other.

45:57.411 --> 45:59.980
Perhaps you know more.

45:59.981 --> 46:02.016
I've been thinking, perhaps
you know a lot more.

46:14.095 --> 46:17.363
Mr. Smith. I'm Sheriff
Larson, this is Deputy Pike.

46:17.598 --> 46:18.998
Uh...

46:18.999 --> 46:20.701
Hi.

46:20.702 --> 46:22.503
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

46:22.504 --> 46:25.039
Yes, there is a problem.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.441
Two men and a girl were
staying in room 10.

46:27.442 --> 46:30.410
We found the two men down the road.
Very dead.

46:30.778 --> 46:32.446
On the interstate?

46:32.447 --> 46:35.291
No. Down the road. I was
wondering if you'd seen

46:35.292 --> 46:37.985
anything unusual
around here tonight.

46:37.986 --> 46:40.219
- No, I didn't.
- Mmm.

46:41.055 --> 46:45.092
We're looking for the girl.
She's tall, attractive, in her 20s.

46:45.093 --> 46:46.560
Didn't happen to see her
around here tonight,

46:46.561 --> 46:47.828
did you?
No, I didn't.

46:47.829 --> 46:48.929
No?
No.

46:48.930 --> 46:50.464
Well, that's funny.

46:50.465 --> 46:53.201
'Cause someone said they thought
they saw you and a girl

46:53.202 --> 46:54.935
getting in your car
earlier tonight.

46:54.936 --> 46:56.971
Who told you that?

46:56.972 --> 46:58.939
Who were you speaking to before?

46:58.940 --> 47:01.642
I was on the phone, with my wife.

47:01.643 --> 47:04.111
I heard you got into a little
trouble tonight, Mr. Smith.

47:04.112 --> 47:05.913
Excuse me?

47:05.914 --> 47:07.454
With your wife.
She stabbed you.

47:09.617 --> 47:11.152
Yes. It's nothing serious.

47:11.153 --> 47:12.887
Where you from, Mr. Smith?
Pittsburgh.

47:12.888 --> 47:14.188
What brings you here?

47:14.189 --> 47:16.123
I'm just passing through.

47:16.124 --> 47:17.558
- Passing through?
- Yeah.

47:17.559 --> 47:19.160
You drive 300 miles
with a stab wound.

47:19.161 --> 47:20.995
I find that odd,
Mr. Smith. Don't you?

47:20.996 --> 47:23.196
Not if you know my wife.

47:27.201 --> 47:31.071
You're traveling light, Mr. Smith.
No credit cards.

47:31.072 --> 47:34.240
But you didn't forget
your cash, did you?

47:35.142 --> 47:38.211
I carry my money separate.
In a rubber band.

47:40.448 --> 47:42.216
What is it that you do in
Pittsburgh, Mr. Smith?

47:42.217 --> 47:43.751
I work for the city.

47:43.752 --> 47:45.786
What's with the third degree here?

47:45.787 --> 47:47.855
I mean, I told you
I didn't see anybody.

47:47.856 --> 47:49.523
When do you plan on leaving?

47:49.524 --> 47:51.257
Ask him.

47:51.992 --> 47:53.961
Ask him.
He knows everything.

47:53.962 --> 47:55.795
- He knows everything about me.
- Ned.

47:56.730 --> 47:57.932
How long is he staying?

47:57.933 --> 47:59.467
Just for the night.

47:59.468 --> 48:01.101
- See?
- Just for the night?

48:01.102 --> 48:02.303
That's what he said.

48:02.404 --> 48:06.507
Yeah. Gonna go back in the morning
and patch things up with my wife.

48:06.508 --> 48:08.042
That's it.

48:08.043 --> 48:10.811
You know, Bob's your uncle.
Mmm-hmm.

48:10.812 --> 48:13.379
Well, good night, Mr. Smith.
All right.

48:16.517 --> 48:17.852
Get that hand seen to.

48:17.853 --> 48:19.393
Yeah. It's fine.
Thank you, sir.

48:21.956 --> 48:23.356
Ned.

48:32.032 --> 48:33.501
Hey, you.

48:33.502 --> 48:34.801
Mr. Smith.

48:37.004 --> 48:38.971
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

48:39.673 --> 48:41.075
What do you mean?

48:41.076 --> 48:43.544
Where do you get off telling
them my life story?

48:43.545 --> 48:47.114
It's my civic duty.
I've known the sheriff for a long time.

48:47.115 --> 48:49.083
Listen to me, you little rodent.

48:49.084 --> 48:51.185
You're gonna keep your mouth shut.

48:51.186 --> 48:53.888
Now, you back to your office and you
mind your own goddamn business.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.856
Do you understand me?

48:55.857 --> 48:57.456
Don't touch my wheelchair.

49:02.763 --> 49:05.498
You shouldn't have
done that, Mr. Smith.

49:06.634 --> 49:09.035
No one touches my wheelchair.

49:10.538 --> 49:13.139
It belongs to my dead mother.

49:34.094 --> 49:37.163
Hey. Wake up. Wake up.

49:47.174 --> 49:48.608
I'm okay.

49:49.677 --> 49:51.510
Put that on your head.

49:52.780 --> 49:55.214
Just got dizzy there for a minute.

49:58.786 --> 50:00.054
Keep the ice on your head.

50:00.055 --> 50:02.756
I'm fine, okay?
I said, keep it on your head.

50:02.757 --> 50:04.091
I'm fine.

50:04.092 --> 50:06.627
Put it up there.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.796
God, is that why she left you?

50:08.797 --> 50:10.463
- Who?
- Your ex?

50:11.098 --> 50:12.365
My ex died.

50:17.871 --> 50:20.074
I know what it's like
to lose someone.

50:20.075 --> 50:22.375
- Do you?
- Yeah.

50:23.310 --> 50:26.646
What's your name?
Mine is Rivka.

50:29.149 --> 50:31.117
My name is Jack.

50:32.019 --> 50:33.419
Were you married?

50:34.321 --> 50:36.355
We were going to.

50:37.758 --> 50:39.225
We were going to be married.

50:42.296 --> 50:44.096
She got murdered.

50:45.399 --> 50:48.135
She didn't want me to
do certain things,

50:48.136 --> 50:50.503
and I had to do certain
things for money.

50:52.373 --> 50:55.708
And we got into a fight about
it and she stormed out.

50:57.211 --> 51:00.279
I had to go do this thing.
While I was away...

51:02.816 --> 51:04.717
She got killed.

51:05.152 --> 51:08.154
Sorry. That's awful.

51:21.869 --> 51:25.671
You can chill out here for a little while
longer, then you gotta get up and go.

51:26.974 --> 51:28.809
Tell me about Dragna.

51:28.810 --> 51:30.443
Why don't you tell me about him?

51:31.812 --> 51:33.447
I don't know anything about him.

51:33.448 --> 51:35.281
No?
No.

51:36.950 --> 51:38.484
You wanna talk about this?

51:42.089 --> 51:44.557
Anything you wanna tell me?

51:48.095 --> 51:50.629
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

51:51.765 --> 51:55.034
I'm gonna give you a
chance to answer honestly.

51:56.904 --> 51:58.072
Did you look in that bag?

51:58.073 --> 51:59.373
Don't have to look

51:59.374 --> 52:01.442
in the bag of
allegiance to know that

52:01.443 --> 52:03.509
it's worth more than
what you're getting.

52:06.280 --> 52:09.281
I'm gonna go out.
Lock the door behind me.

52:10.851 --> 52:12.651
What happens if he
knocks on the door?

52:14.455 --> 52:17.491
Believe me, Dragna
doesn't knock on doors.

52:17.492 --> 52:18.724
Where you going?

53:19.787 --> 53:22.122
What are you doing there,
Mr. Smith?

53:22.123 --> 53:23.522
Oh.

53:24.224 --> 53:25.658
He walks.

53:27.161 --> 53:29.396
It's a remarkable recovery.

53:29.397 --> 53:33.299
I think it's best that
you just dig that up

53:33.934 --> 53:36.635
and you throw that over here.

53:39.439 --> 53:41.674
I said, "Start digging"!

53:44.511 --> 53:48.314
You see, I heard you on the phone.
I know what's going on.

53:49.449 --> 53:50.517
It's not what you think.

53:50.518 --> 53:52.452
No, it's not what you think!

53:52.453 --> 53:53.819
Okay.

53:56.523 --> 54:01.260
You see, what you don't know is
that man, he's been here before.

54:01.495 --> 54:02.830
What man? Who?

54:02.831 --> 54:04.230
On the phone!

54:05.866 --> 54:08.936
It's been years,

54:08.937 --> 54:13.706
but that voice I'll never forget
and what he done here before.

54:15.609 --> 54:17.945
You don't know what
you're getting into, man.

54:17.946 --> 54:19.279
Oh, that's funny,

54:19.280 --> 54:23.617
because that's what I was
just about to say to you.

54:23.618 --> 54:26.253
Can you stop shining that light in my
eyes? I can't see what I'm digging.

54:26.254 --> 54:27.621
- You just keep digging.
- Okay, okay.

54:27.622 --> 54:29.489
- I don't owe him nothing this time.
- Okay. Okay.

54:29.490 --> 54:30.991
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

54:30.992 --> 54:33.692
You get that out of the hole.
Okay. Okay.

54:36.463 --> 54:40.133
That's good.
Put it down right there.

54:40.134 --> 54:42.536
Move back away.
Go on. Move away.

54:42.537 --> 54:44.470
- Get back over there.
- Okay.

54:53.580 --> 54:55.181
Goddamn.

54:56.116 --> 54:58.484
Ow! Ow!

55:00.454 --> 55:01.854
God!

55:04.491 --> 55:06.225
Damn it.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.880
Fuck.

56:23.170 --> 56:26.305
Come on, Kitty.
We're going, Kitty.

56:26.506 --> 56:28.474
What's going on?

56:48.028 --> 56:49.129
Who is it?

56:49.130 --> 56:50.596
Sheriff Larson.

56:54.167 --> 56:55.669
Did I wake you, Mr. Smith?

56:55.670 --> 56:57.270
No, I was just lying down.

56:57.271 --> 56:58.904
Unlock the door, please.

57:06.279 --> 57:08.947
Hmm. Did she drive all the way
out here and stab you again?

57:10.584 --> 57:12.519
No, no, it just started
bleeding again.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.087
You should get that checked out.

57:14.088 --> 57:15.454
It's fine.

57:16.490 --> 57:17.724
You haven't seen Mr. Stenson
around, have you?

57:17.725 --> 57:19.292
Who?

57:19.293 --> 57:20.593
The manager of the hotel.

57:21.294 --> 57:23.063
- No.
- That's funny.

57:23.064 --> 57:25.098
We've been looking everywhere
for him, we can't find him.

57:25.099 --> 57:26.733
But his car's parked out front.

57:26.734 --> 57:29.469
Oh, maybe he's skulking around,
doing wheelies or something.

57:29.470 --> 57:30.704
I don't know.

57:30.705 --> 57:31.937
Maybe.

57:43.483 --> 57:45.118
When are you leaving, Mr. Smith?

57:45.119 --> 57:46.885
Uh...

57:47.087 --> 57:48.655
In the morning.

57:48.656 --> 57:49.790
In the morning?

57:49.791 --> 57:51.590
Yeah.

57:53.460 --> 57:54.828
Back to Pittsburgh?

57:54.829 --> 57:56.829
Yeah.

57:58.799 --> 58:01.201
Yeah.

58:01.202 --> 58:04.002
Gotta go patch things
up with my wife.

58:05.605 --> 58:07.107
Mmm.

58:09.177 --> 58:11.845
I realized I probably
brought this on myself.

58:11.846 --> 58:13.946
It's my fault.

58:42.142 --> 58:43.809
Well, well, well.

58:44.411 --> 58:46.578
What do we have here?

58:46.713 --> 58:48.046
Yours?

58:48.782 --> 58:50.082
My wife's.

58:53.820 --> 58:55.621
Your wife's?

59:10.704 --> 59:12.137
And this?

59:15.442 --> 59:17.344
I don't know, it was in
the room when I got here.

59:17.345 --> 59:18.745
Hmm.

59:18.746 --> 59:21.747
A Gideon Bible and a
shovel in every room.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.222
You're under arrest, Mr. Smith.

59:29.223 --> 59:31.525
Something's come to light
since our last meeting.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.192
What the fuck?

59:36.396 --> 59:37.996
Gotcha.

59:39.633 --> 59:43.270
Now, will you give me a
reason to break your skull?

59:43.271 --> 59:47.606
I challenge you to a battle of
wits but you'll be unarmed.

01:00:51.271 --> 01:00:53.071
Nice, Jones.

01:01:04.484 --> 01:01:07.152
Okay, boys, you know what to do.

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:16.161
Why? Why am I here?

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:19.064
Target practice, Mr. Smith.

01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:30.742
Where did you bury it, Mr. Smith?

01:01:31.378 --> 01:01:32.612
Bury what?

01:01:32.613 --> 01:01:35.047
The bag, Mr. Smith. The bag.

01:01:35.048 --> 01:01:36.615
What bag?

01:01:37.317 --> 01:01:39.051
There's two ways this can work.

01:01:39.419 --> 01:01:40.787
I can beat you to death,

01:01:40.788 --> 01:01:43.989
or two, you can tell me
where you put it.

01:01:52.366 --> 01:01:56.469
Just because it's inevitable doesn't
mean it's imminent, Mr. Smith.

01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:59.472
I have all night.
My shift doesn't finish till 7:00.

01:02:03.843 --> 01:02:07.881
We have a long, long way to go.

01:02:07.882 --> 01:02:10.882
Chief. I got your
wife on the phone.

01:02:17.824 --> 01:02:20.660
Why did you tell her I was here?

01:02:20.661 --> 01:02:22.762
What was I supposed to say?
That I'm not here.

01:02:26.032 --> 01:02:27.265
Hey.

01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:32.004
Macadamia Chocolate crunch.
That's...

01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:37.110
I don't like Chunky Monkey.

01:02:37.111 --> 01:02:38.677
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:39.379 --> 01:02:40.812
Yeah.

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:43.416
Can I help you?

01:02:43.417 --> 01:02:48.120
I think you're looking for me.
I'm the girl from the motel.

01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:49.788
Huh.

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.991
You were with those two in the car?

01:02:53.526 --> 01:02:54.694
Yeah, that's me.

01:02:54.695 --> 01:02:56.128
Who you looking for?

01:02:56.996 --> 01:02:58.498
I'm not looking for anyone.

01:02:58.499 --> 01:03:00.198
Is that right? Mmm.

01:03:01.568 --> 01:03:04.102
Come with me. It's okay.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.981
You know him?

01:03:14.982 --> 01:03:16.248
No.

01:03:27.394 --> 01:03:31.329
Now, what have we got in here, huh?
What do we have in here?

01:03:33.833 --> 01:03:36.536
Oh.

01:03:36.537 --> 01:03:39.805
I don't know this bitch.
She's got nothing to do with me.

01:03:41.908 --> 01:03:45.877
Looks like we have a bad girl.
Bad girls need to be punished.

01:03:48.782 --> 01:03:52.184
Deputy Pike. Deputy Pike.

01:03:52.185 --> 01:03:54.421
Check her good.

01:03:54.422 --> 01:03:57.023
Coke whores will hide it
just about anywhere.

01:03:57.024 --> 01:03:58.525
Get in here.

01:03:58.526 --> 01:04:01.860
Check every spot. Every hole.

01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:09.334
Come on, get in here.

01:04:14.741 --> 01:04:18.778
Hey, stupid bitch. Yeah.

01:04:20.548 --> 01:04:22.948
Yeah?

01:04:25.084 --> 01:04:27.454
Hold her. Grab her hands.

01:04:27.455 --> 01:04:30.188
Look what we got here.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.128
Well, well, well.

01:04:35.129 --> 01:04:37.730
Looks like she intended
to hurt you, Deputy Pike.

01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:40.166
Make sure she doesn't have
a shotgun up her ass.

01:04:40.167 --> 01:04:41.867
Oh, let's check.

01:04:41.935 --> 01:04:43.401
Mr. Smith.

01:04:45.538 --> 01:04:48.240
Thought these were yours,
Mr. Smith.

01:04:49.008 --> 01:04:51.678
Oh, Christ.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.112
But we do know they're
panties, don't we?

01:05:13.933 --> 01:05:15.554
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

01:05:20.573 --> 01:05:22.040
Where is it?

01:05:22.675 --> 01:05:24.042
It's at the motel.

01:05:24.177 --> 01:05:25.512
Where at the motel?

01:05:25.513 --> 01:05:27.247
It's too dark.
It's impossible to find.

01:05:27.248 --> 01:05:29.516
I had to walk through the forest.

01:05:29.517 --> 01:05:31.050
Just tell me where it is.
I'll take you right there.

01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:32.884
I gotta walk you there.

01:05:34.554 --> 01:05:36.689
If this is some kind
of wild goose chase

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:38.857
we will take liberties
with this girl.

01:05:39.859 --> 01:05:41.426
I'll take you right to it.

01:05:43.897 --> 01:05:45.064
Deputy Pike,
you look after Miss Pretty.

01:05:45.065 --> 01:05:46.566
Gladly.

01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:47.800
Jones, come with me.

01:05:47.801 --> 01:05:49.135
Sir.

01:05:49.136 --> 01:05:50.936
I'll grab the car.

01:06:07.253 --> 01:06:08.620
Get up.

01:06:12.559 --> 01:06:16.062
Do you have any idea
what I'm gonna do to you

01:06:16.063 --> 01:06:18.230
if they don't come
back with that bag?

01:06:18.231 --> 01:06:19.865
Hey.

01:06:33.146 --> 01:06:34.512
Pike!

01:06:35.615 --> 01:06:36.982
Pike!

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:39.352
Pike!

01:06:39.353 --> 01:06:41.286
Sheriff. Get in here.

01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:43.923
Sheriff.

01:06:43.924 --> 01:06:45.658
- Keys.
- I can't find them.

01:06:45.659 --> 01:06:47.025
Gun.

01:06:48.728 --> 01:06:50.362
Ahh!
Pike!

01:07:28.768 --> 01:07:30.269
You all right?

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:33.171
Yeah. It's not deep.

01:07:43.182 --> 01:07:45.351
That's a lot of bodies
to leave lying around.

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:46.686
You'd rather we put
'em in the trunk?

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:48.721
Please, the trunk
that never closes?

01:07:52.925 --> 01:07:55.995
Before I speak, is there anything
else in here I should know about?

01:07:55.996 --> 01:07:57.296
What do you mean?

01:07:57.297 --> 01:07:59.932
Guns, knives, dynamite,
uranium, nunchucks?

01:07:59.933 --> 01:08:01.801
Amazing what a curious
kitty can find

01:08:01.802 --> 01:08:03.369
just lying around your
average motel room.

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:05.905
Guns, bodies...

01:08:05.906 --> 01:08:07.940
I wouldn't like to
be your neighbor.

01:08:07.941 --> 01:08:10.410
Playing the TV too loud were they?

01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:14.814
Oh, TV! You're in the
movie now, starring role.

01:08:14.815 --> 01:08:16.381
Oh, I know.

01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:18.317
No. I don't think you do.

01:08:18.318 --> 01:08:20.019
We just killed three cops.

01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:23.221
They were ready to take us God
knows where and dump our bodies.

01:08:23.223 --> 01:08:26.624
Even if you would've dug it up,
he still would've killed you!

01:08:33.733 --> 01:08:35.367
What do you mean, "Dug it up"?

01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:41.538
I mean, if you would've given
him the bag, you know...

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:46.412
How would they know I buried it?

01:08:46.412 --> 01:08:48.948
Well, when you walked
in with a shovel,

01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:52.617
I didn't think you were doing some
late-night gardening behind the motel.

01:08:53.786 --> 01:08:56.322
Well, how do you know
it was behind the motel?

01:08:58.892 --> 01:09:01.658
Fine, you buried it
in front of the motel.

01:09:06.866 --> 01:09:09.935
I swear to God,
if that bag isn't there,

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:13.305
I will dig a hole and I
will bury you in the woods.

01:09:13.307 --> 01:09:15.908
I didn't have to come for you.

01:09:15.908 --> 01:09:19.377
I could've taken that bag
and left you there,

01:09:19.379 --> 01:09:23.349
and they would've killed you and
they never would've found me.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.582
I got shot saving you!

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:30.688
You're an idiot, you know that?

01:09:34.894 --> 01:09:36.328
Maybe.

01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:37.529
Yes, you are.

01:09:37.531 --> 01:09:39.198
I'll drive.

01:09:39.198 --> 01:09:40.832
Look for the keys.

01:09:40.834 --> 01:09:42.533
Okay.

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:17.502
All right, let's shoot
these handcuffs off.

01:10:19.205 --> 01:10:20.540
I like hearing that.

01:10:20.541 --> 01:10:22.507
Come on.

01:10:28.314 --> 01:10:30.315
Here.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:33.284
I got it.

01:10:40.193 --> 01:10:42.160
Okay.

01:10:43.529 --> 01:10:45.932
Is this how your hand got shot?

01:10:45.933 --> 01:10:47.967
If you shoot me in the hand,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:10:47.968 --> 01:10:50.336
You shouldn't threaten a
person pointing a gun at you.

01:10:50.337 --> 01:10:52.570
All right. Right.
Go right to the chain.

01:10:53.105 --> 01:10:54.273
What if I miss?

01:10:54.274 --> 01:10:56.509
You're not gonna
shoot me from Texas.

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:59.410
Just come right up
to the chain, okay?

01:11:00.246 --> 01:11:02.081
Ready?

01:11:02.082 --> 01:11:06.185
No, no, down lower, lower.
Don't point it at my fucking hand.

01:11:06.186 --> 01:11:08.054
Right there. You ready?
Yeah.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:09.889
Count of three.
Yeah, I think you're on the chain.

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.557
Okay.

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:14.159
One...

01:11:15.928 --> 01:11:17.129
That's a hit!

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.597
No, no, no. That's a miss.

01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:22.935
Thank you.

01:11:22.936 --> 01:11:26.838
Seems like a waste of a perfectly
good pair of handcuffs to me.

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:45.456
Another time, another place.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:49.394
Where are you going?

01:12:57.363 --> 01:12:58.497
I was thinking.

01:12:58.498 --> 01:12:59.864
Yeah?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.636
Let's get out of here.

01:13:03.637 --> 01:13:04.737
Take that bag with us?

01:13:04.738 --> 01:13:06.571
Yeah.

01:13:10.176 --> 01:13:11.344
Where do you want to go?

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:12.744
You name it.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.861
That's cute.

01:13:17.984 --> 01:13:18.950
Hello.

01:13:20.753 --> 01:13:22.420
Hello?

01:13:26.759 --> 01:13:29.427
You're out of your mind.
Come on, you gotta go.

01:13:30.563 --> 01:13:32.064
Where the hell am I going to go?

01:13:32.065 --> 01:13:33.566
You... How the hell should
I know where you go?

01:13:33.567 --> 01:13:35.501
You go home.

01:13:35.502 --> 01:13:37.902
I don't wanna go home.
I wanna stay.

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:42.775
Everything is so...

01:13:42.776 --> 01:13:44.577
Every time I try to do something...

01:13:44.578 --> 01:13:48.080
I mean, I don't even
give a damn anymore.

01:13:48.081 --> 01:13:50.216
But I mean...

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.751
Someone like you.

01:13:51.752 --> 01:13:53.751
Someone like me what?

01:13:55.221 --> 01:13:57.955
Someone like you... I mean...

01:13:59.492 --> 01:14:02.461
I can feel you.

01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:05.531
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:14:05.532 --> 01:14:08.833
You know, like I know you.

01:14:09.502 --> 01:14:11.070
You don't know Jack.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.904
Please.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.575
I don't know

01:14:16.576 --> 01:14:19.712
if he's coming to take
the bag and kill me.

01:14:19.713 --> 01:14:22.214
I don't know if he's coming
to take the bag and pay me.

01:14:22.215 --> 01:14:24.116
I don't know if he's
coming by himself

01:14:24.117 --> 01:14:26.018
or he's coming with a
whole fucking army.

01:14:26.786 --> 01:14:28.820
You gotta go.

01:14:36.195 --> 01:14:38.062
It's impossible.

01:14:39.532 --> 01:14:40.998
I made a deal.

01:14:56.415 --> 01:14:59.518
Well, I guess that's that.

01:14:59.519 --> 01:15:02.487
Maybe we'll run into
each other someday.

01:15:04.123 --> 01:15:05.490
Yeah, maybe.

01:15:07.526 --> 01:15:10.027
Kitty Cat's gotta go her own way.

01:15:12.565 --> 01:15:15.734
Cats are amazing animals though.

01:15:15.735 --> 01:15:17.803
Survive all sorts of terrible shit,

01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:20.206
they always land up on their feet.

01:15:20.207 --> 01:15:21.906
Not always.

01:15:28.881 --> 01:15:30.681
Good-bye.

01:16:18.564 --> 01:16:19.865
Quickly.

01:16:22.801 --> 01:16:24.436
Quick, quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

01:16:24.437 --> 01:16:26.103
Shit.
Come on.

01:16:27.673 --> 01:16:29.909
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:31.210
Come on.

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.778
Come on.

01:16:42.188 --> 01:16:43.856
Why are we hiding?

01:16:43.857 --> 01:16:46.524
We're just gonna take
a minute to think.

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:54.333
How about that for an entrance?

01:16:54.334 --> 01:16:57.303
Lucky there are
interconnecting rooms.

01:16:57.304 --> 01:16:58.970
Put the pistol on the bed.

01:17:06.979 --> 01:17:09.547
Make him comfortable.

01:17:11.617 --> 01:17:13.251
Sit.

01:17:13.586 --> 01:17:16.288
You too.

01:17:16.289 --> 01:17:18.390
Tell me something, Jack,

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:20.759
I always thought that the number 13

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.229
had a one and then
a three right after it.

01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:25.264
But, you know, it's been a
while since grade school,

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:27.499
so, you know,
I could have that wrong.

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.867
We have a problem, Jack?

01:17:28.868 --> 01:17:31.270
No.

01:17:31.271 --> 01:17:33.305
Because when I tell you
to wait in room 13

01:17:33.306 --> 01:17:35.241
and I see you waiting in room 14,

01:17:35.242 --> 01:17:36.342
it makes me ponder,

01:17:36.343 --> 01:17:37.843
"Why would Jack go into room 14

01:17:37.844 --> 01:17:41.013
"when I explicitly told him
to go into room 13?"

01:17:41.014 --> 01:17:44.750
I mean that's exceedingly
specific, is it not?

01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:48.020
I know you can count because you're
an eminently intelligent person,

01:17:48.021 --> 01:17:51.657
so I know it can't be any
sort of cognitive issue.

01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:53.259
So what is it?

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:56.328
I muse upon this and I start to think,
"Well, there must be a problem."

01:17:56.329 --> 01:17:58.564
There's no problem.
I got the bag. I just want...

01:17:58.565 --> 01:18:00.032
No, there is a problem, Jack.

01:18:00.033 --> 01:18:03.269
Distrust is a disease
that kills a friendship.

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:08.574
When you sneak into room 14 after
I specifically told you room 13,

01:18:08.575 --> 01:18:11.343
that's because you clearly
don't trust me, Jack.

01:18:11.344 --> 01:18:15.814
That's a problem. When I see that you're
starting to lose your trust in me, Jack,

01:18:15.815 --> 01:18:19.351
then I, reciprocally,
start to lose my trust in you.

01:18:19.352 --> 01:18:21.654
I start to think,
"Maybe I can't trust this Jack."

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:23.322
I don't mean
disrespect or anything,

01:18:23.323 --> 01:18:24.723
but how am I supposed to trust you?

01:18:24.724 --> 01:18:26.525
You send Bishop out after me.

01:18:26.526 --> 01:18:28.360
He tries to kill me.
He ends up shooting me in the hand...

01:18:28.361 --> 01:18:29.962
Well, frankly, I never
really cared much for Bishop.

01:18:29.963 --> 01:18:32.831
What about those two
cartoon Feds next door?

01:18:32.832 --> 01:18:34.867
With the silencers,
they were stalking deer?

01:18:34.868 --> 01:18:36.535
Jack, come on.
If I wanted you dead,

01:18:36.536 --> 01:18:39.036
we wouldn't even be talking
right now. You know that.

01:18:39.037 --> 01:18:41.674
But I have to admit, you're
a one-man demolition crew.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:44.510
I've owned this motel, the Sheriff

01:18:44.511 --> 01:18:47.346
and everything within
miles for years.

01:18:47.347 --> 01:18:50.382
It's been the favorite place
for drop offs, you name it.

01:18:50.383 --> 01:18:51.469
But I am impressed.

01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:53.786
Just because you're paranoid doesn't
mean they're not after you.

01:18:53.787 --> 01:18:55.821
You certainly raised the bar.

01:18:55.822 --> 01:18:58.324
I hear I even lost
my Russian dwarf.

01:18:58.325 --> 01:18:59.692
He was Serbian-Roma.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.393
Did you ever get a
chance to take a look

01:19:01.394 --> 01:19:04.029
at that Hermann Hesse novel I
recommended, <i>Magister Ludi?</i>

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:06.332
I just want my money,
get out of here.

01:19:06.333 --> 01:19:07.800
Can I give you a little
bit of advice, Jack?

01:19:07.801 --> 01:19:09.635
Yeah.

01:19:09.636 --> 01:19:13.105
If you took one-tenth of the
time you spend on killing people

01:19:13.106 --> 01:19:15.674
and devoted it to reading
a book now and then,

01:19:15.675 --> 01:19:18.977
I really think you would derive
great benefit. Don't you?

01:19:18.978 --> 01:19:21.013
I just want my goddamn money.
That's it.

01:19:21.014 --> 01:19:22.647
Jack,

01:19:23.549 --> 01:19:25.951
you're not gonna introduce
me to your friend here?

01:19:25.952 --> 01:19:27.419
She's not a part of this.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.988
Oh, yes, she is a part of it.

01:19:29.989 --> 01:19:31.990
You have a whore sitting here
in the middle of our business,

01:19:31.991 --> 01:19:34.026
you made her a part of it, Jack.

01:19:34.027 --> 01:19:36.827
You know what
<i>"Magister Ludi"</i> means, Jack?

01:19:37.029 --> 01:19:38.362
Master of the game.

01:19:38.897 --> 01:19:40.733
Master of the game!

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.035
Would it surprise you
if you found out

01:19:43.036 --> 01:19:45.504
that this hot Tic Tac
here worked for me?

01:19:45.505 --> 01:19:47.106
Possible, right?

01:19:47.107 --> 01:19:48.707
I mean, come on, dude.

01:19:48.708 --> 01:19:50.976
You check into a motel in
the middle of nowhere,

01:19:50.977 --> 01:19:53.912
and you just happen to meet this
six-foot, weapons-proficient stripper

01:19:53.913 --> 01:19:56.382
with aspirations to teach
second-grade in Kansas.

01:19:56.383 --> 01:19:57.549
What are the odds on that?

01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:01.053
I mean, I guess it could happen.
I met my wife at a fucking Staples.

01:20:01.054 --> 01:20:02.388
Listen to me.

01:20:02.389 --> 01:20:03.956
What's really happened here, huh?

01:20:03.957 --> 01:20:06.058
Nothing. Nothing.
It's a business transaction.

01:20:06.059 --> 01:20:07.726
I did everything you
asked me to do.

01:20:07.727 --> 01:20:09.428
I'm sitting here in
this goddamn motel.

01:20:09.429 --> 01:20:11.497
I'm going out of my mind
in this goddamn motel.

01:20:11.498 --> 01:20:13.238
And all I want to
do is get my money.

01:20:13.499 --> 01:20:15.032
Tell me the truth.

01:20:16.735 --> 01:20:18.470
Did you look inside the bag?

01:20:18.471 --> 01:20:20.539
We had a deal. No.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.874
Anybody see it?

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:23.108
No.

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:24.109
You show it to anybody?

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:25.644
No.

01:20:25.645 --> 01:20:28.286
How about your girlfriend here?
She sneak a little peek inside?

01:20:31.049 --> 01:20:32.917
No.

01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:47.900
Death is inside that bag.

01:20:47.901 --> 01:20:50.334
Did Jack tell you that?

01:20:50.536 --> 01:20:52.671
No.

01:20:52.672 --> 01:20:54.840
We had an agreement.
I kept my end of the bargain.

01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:56.708
You either believe me or you don't.

01:20:56.709 --> 01:21:00.111
Trust, the foundation
of friendship.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:03.380
No, I trust you.

01:21:08.053 --> 01:21:09.188
Okay.

01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:13.057
The bag, Jack, where's the bag?

01:21:18.664 --> 01:21:21.365
Under the bed. That's just genius.

01:21:23.802 --> 01:21:25.269
Huh?

01:21:26.772 --> 01:21:28.139
On the bed.

01:21:48.994 --> 01:21:50.494
Unbelievable.

01:21:53.165 --> 01:21:55.634
I wish I could share this
with you, Jack. I do.

01:21:55.635 --> 01:21:57.836
But as fate would
have it, I just can't.

01:21:57.837 --> 01:21:59.204
I want you to know something.

01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:04.408
All this, everything, was a
test, Jack, to test you.

01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:06.544
To test our friendship.

01:22:07.179 --> 01:22:08.981
I have a job.

01:22:08.982 --> 01:22:11.617
It's more than a job,
it's a life changer.

01:22:11.618 --> 01:22:14.253
I need one man,
just one special man.

01:22:14.254 --> 01:22:16.788
With your cut, you can buy
your own private island

01:22:16.789 --> 01:22:19.725
and you can fly there in your
own Boeing Business Jet.

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:21.927
I told you not to look in
the bag and you didn't.

01:22:21.928 --> 01:22:25.197
You kept your word.
You passed.

01:22:25.198 --> 01:22:27.099
I am so proud of you.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.001
This Pavlovian loyalty of yours

01:22:29.002 --> 01:22:30.869
is really kind of mind-boggling.

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:33.005
You're a total throwback.

01:22:33.006 --> 01:22:36.008
I mean, you're like some blacksmith
in colonial Williamsburg.

01:22:36.009 --> 01:22:38.243
You're like an aborigine
with a boomerang

01:22:38.244 --> 01:22:41.245
hunting in the diorama of some natural
history museum. Unbelievable.

01:22:41.246 --> 01:22:43.181
How do you know I'm not lying?
Oh, I know.

01:22:43.182 --> 01:22:47.019
Trust me. It would be
all over your face.

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:51.256
There's money and very, very important
instructions in that satchel.

01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:53.123
Goose.

01:22:54.226 --> 01:22:55.961
- Do you believe me?
- Sure.

01:22:55.962 --> 01:22:59.030
You wanna count it?
Of course not.

01:22:59.031 --> 01:23:03.335
Now we have trust again,
as I would have predicted.

01:23:03.336 --> 01:23:06.204
You know, when you're aware,
Jack, of someone's tropisms,

01:23:06.205 --> 01:23:08.640
you can predict what
directions he'll turn in

01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:11.043
in response to certain stimuli.

01:23:11.044 --> 01:23:13.712
People are what they are
and they do what they do.

01:23:13.713 --> 01:23:17.149
Does Kojak cook kasha? No.
Kojak sucks on Tootsie Pops.

01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:19.217
People always say,
you know, if Lenny Bruce

01:23:19.218 --> 01:23:22.020
or Miles Davis or Jimi
Hendrix didn't do drugs,

01:23:22.021 --> 01:23:23.989
they would have done
so much better.

01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:25.924
Actually, I don't think
they would have done shit.

01:23:25.925 --> 01:23:28.193
Tropisms.

01:23:28.194 --> 01:23:31.129
You know, originally, I was going
to pursue a career in academia?

01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:34.531
I have a Master's degree in
Transnational Criminal Syndicates.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.068
Seriously.

01:23:36.069 --> 01:23:38.670
My thesis was about
the relationship

01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:40.606
between the yakuza
and ultranationalist

01:23:40.607 --> 01:23:42.608
right-wing politics
in post-war Japan.

01:23:42.609 --> 01:23:45.277
I was gonna be a professor.

01:23:45.278 --> 01:23:48.280
Then, one day, I was watching
an episode of <i>Full House,</i>

01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:50.382
where Jesse goes
bungee-jumping with Becky?

01:23:50.383 --> 01:23:52.117
Changed my whole life.

01:23:52.118 --> 01:23:56.922
I decided, "You know what?
I gotta take the plunge."

01:23:56.923 --> 01:23:59.191
I don't want to sit on the
sidelines my whole life.

01:23:59.192 --> 01:24:02.628
I don't want to teach,
I want to do.

01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:03.594
Let's go.

01:24:05.864 --> 01:24:07.631
The big one's soon.

01:24:09.635 --> 01:24:11.502
Caveat emptor.

01:24:16.341 --> 01:24:19.076
Jack...

01:24:27.219 --> 01:24:28.420
I looked...
You looked in the bag.

01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:30.487
In the bag...

01:24:34.793 --> 01:24:36.961
Yeah.

01:24:49.307 --> 01:24:51.575
You know we're gonna die.

01:24:53.745 --> 01:24:55.747
God damn it!

01:24:55.748 --> 01:24:58.048
Hey.

01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:01.986
What, the bills
aren't crisp enough?

01:25:03.355 --> 01:25:04.555
There's a problem.

01:25:05.791 --> 01:25:07.558
What's that?

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.762
Cat looked in the bag.
I didn't know.

01:25:13.131 --> 01:25:17.002
Jack, sometimes you disappoint
the hell out of me.

01:25:17.003 --> 01:25:19.271
You got emotionally
involved with a whore?

01:25:19.272 --> 01:25:21.171
Yeah.

01:25:22.374 --> 01:25:23.475
She's not a whore.

01:25:23.476 --> 01:25:24.876
All women are whores.

01:25:24.877 --> 01:25:26.812
No, they're not.

01:25:26.813 --> 01:25:28.914
Take care of your business,
Jack, right now.

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:30.782
Okay. She's not a whore.

01:25:30.783 --> 01:25:33.218
Shut your goddamn mouth!
You're making me sick.

01:25:33.219 --> 01:25:36.121
Can I see the bag for a minute?
What?

01:25:36.122 --> 01:25:37.322
I want to see what's in the bag.

01:25:37.323 --> 01:25:39.324
For what?
I want to look inside.

01:25:39.325 --> 01:25:41.259
Who do you think
you are talking to?

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:44.162
You don't talk to me,
I talk to you.

01:25:44.163 --> 01:25:47.197
You know what you have to do,
take care of business.

01:26:18.797 --> 01:26:21.065
Jack.

01:26:37.182 --> 01:26:38.816
Kill him.

01:26:43.488 --> 01:26:45.157
I don't wanna leave you.

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.824
I'll be right here.

01:26:49.127 --> 01:26:50.661
Kill him.

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:53.864
Here, take this.

01:27:50.122 --> 01:27:53.590
Try and give the master
of the game a better game, Jack.

01:28:10.475 --> 01:28:12.609
Jesus, Jack!

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:20.318
You passed the Lizard
and Sheriff tests,

01:28:20.319 --> 01:28:21.919
but I'm out of your league, Jack.

01:28:53.952 --> 01:28:56.553
I see you haven't
read Sunzi's <i>Art of War.</i>

01:29:27.519 --> 01:29:28.919
Shot ya.

01:29:44.069 --> 01:29:46.003
What's in the bag?

01:29:47.439 --> 01:29:48.740
It was a gift. You were
just too blind to see it.

01:29:48.741 --> 01:29:50.241
What's in the fucking bag?

01:29:50.242 --> 01:29:52.110
Oh, shut up.

01:29:52.111 --> 01:29:54.512
What's gonna happen now is you're
gonna throw your gun over here.

01:29:54.513 --> 01:29:56.548
I'm gonna throw my gun over there?

01:29:56.549 --> 01:29:58.616
The motel, my motel,

01:29:58.617 --> 01:30:02.554
is rigged with enough C4 to wipe
it off the face of the Earth.

01:30:02.555 --> 01:30:06.191
And in case you were
wondering what this is.

01:30:06.192 --> 01:30:10.195
It's a detonator. Not a coincidence.
Am I lying?

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.263
I'm gonna count to three.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna count to two.

01:30:12.264 --> 01:30:15.300
You wanna start, or should I?

01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:19.237
You didn't leave your girlfriend
in the room there, did you?

01:30:19.238 --> 01:30:22.073
You know, something tells
me you might have.

01:30:22.074 --> 01:30:24.442
You just can't keep the
women in your life

01:30:24.443 --> 01:30:26.843
from dying horrible,
violent deaths, can you?

01:30:27.112 --> 01:30:28.446
I don't care about her.

01:30:28.447 --> 01:30:30.682
I think you do care
about her, Jack.

01:30:30.683 --> 01:30:32.517
That's your whole,
tragic thing here.

01:30:32.518 --> 01:30:34.519
And by "tragic" I mean "pathetic."

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.621
Tell me what's in the bag.
What's in the bag?

01:30:39.124 --> 01:30:41.692
I think you have to
look for yourself.

01:31:12.624 --> 01:31:15.660
They never recovered your fiance's
entire body, did they, Jack?

01:31:15.661 --> 01:31:18.729
No leads, no clues.

01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:21.998
She had no enemies.
She just had you.

01:31:22.467 --> 01:31:25.370
I couldn't let my best man go.

01:31:25.371 --> 01:31:29.240
In this business you are sui generis.
Absolutely unique.

01:31:29.241 --> 01:31:30.642
Your word is your bond.

01:31:30.643 --> 01:31:33.211
Your fiance was taking
you away from me.

01:31:33.212 --> 01:31:35.447
I couldn't allow that.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:38.283
I told you I'd find the guy who
did it and bring him to you.

01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:41.852
It took me a little time, but
I'm also a man of my word.

01:31:43.388 --> 01:31:45.389
Here I am.

01:31:47.225 --> 01:31:49.427
You know,

01:31:49.428 --> 01:31:51.830
I'm doing you a favor by putting
you out of your misery. Trust me.

01:31:51.831 --> 01:31:54.099
Six divorces and eight kids later,

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.667
I'll tell you one thing as
sure as the day you die.

01:31:55.668 --> 01:31:57.901
A woman will always let you down.

01:32:13.485 --> 01:32:15.519
Was that your good hand?

01:32:16.254 --> 01:32:17.889
What are the odds?

01:32:17.890 --> 01:32:20.757
You could have been a
multi-multimillionaire...

01:32:21.659 --> 01:32:23.727
- Or at least a contender.
- Drop it.

01:32:24.163 --> 01:32:27.532
Turn around and face me,
you piece of trash.

01:32:27.533 --> 01:32:30.869
Oh, you wouldn't shoot a man
in the back, would you?

01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:33.671
A man, no, but you're not a man.

01:32:33.672 --> 01:32:35.473
I know you.
Shoot him.

01:32:35.474 --> 01:32:38.143
More important is that I know you.

01:32:38.144 --> 01:32:40.111
What are you doing in
public without your horns?

01:32:40.112 --> 01:32:41.913
- Shoot him!
- Horns? That's a good one.

01:32:41.914 --> 01:32:43.781
And just what the fuck are you?

01:32:43.782 --> 01:32:45.850
I'm the one who's dealt
with evil all my life.

01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:47.619
That's a little dramatic.
Not...

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.354
Shoot him!

01:33:08.907 --> 01:33:12.709
If you want me to live,
clap your hands.

01:33:16.281 --> 01:33:18.048
I didn't hear anything.

01:34:07.832 --> 01:34:10.133
It is time to go, Jack.

01:36:04.015 --> 01:36:06.851
Closure.

01:36:06.852 --> 01:36:09.487
I should just mind my
own business, huh?

01:36:09.488 --> 01:36:11.489
If you did, I'd be dead.

01:36:11.490 --> 01:36:12.757
It's true. It's true.

01:36:12.758 --> 01:36:14.224
It is true.

01:36:16.728 --> 01:36:18.261
You are one tough Hebrew.

01:36:19.731 --> 01:36:21.931
You have no idea.

01:36:21.999 --> 01:36:22.799
Mmm.

01:36:24.035 --> 01:36:26.936
Maybe we should go to a hospital.

01:36:27.772 --> 01:36:29.339
You think?

01:36:29.707 --> 01:36:31.676
Just a thought.

01:37:00.438 --> 01:37:03.007
You lawyers have nice offices.

01:37:03.008 --> 01:37:05.476
Thank you very much.
Come and sit down.

01:37:05.477 --> 01:37:07.545
You look like you've been in a war.

01:37:07.546 --> 01:37:09.580
You could say so.

01:37:09.581 --> 01:37:13.818
I'm lucky to have good doctors whose
specialty's not asking questions.

01:37:13.819 --> 01:37:15.653
There's a lot of tidying up to do.

01:37:15.654 --> 01:37:17.954
I suggest we make a start.

01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:28.433
You mentioned something on
the phone about a motel.

01:37:28.434 --> 01:37:29.767
A motel where?

01:37:29.768 --> 01:37:31.636
Louisiana, the bayou.

01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:34.439
You'll like it down there.
It's hot.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.642
And hook up with
some guy named Jack?

01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:42.979
You make sure that this Jack
still has what it takes.

01:37:43.915 --> 01:37:47.050
You fuck with his head,
you understand?

01:37:49.086 --> 01:37:51.722
You're gonna have to
have some play dates

01:37:51.723 --> 01:37:54.192
with the local boys
to pull this off.

01:37:54.193 --> 01:37:56.761
No one's gonna know who the hell
you are or who you work for.

01:37:56.762 --> 01:37:58.095
You're on your own down there.

01:37:58.096 --> 01:37:59.462
Wonderful.

01:38:00.198 --> 01:38:03.100
What's so important about this guy?

01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:05.670
There are people in
my life who I trust,

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:08.105
and there are people
in my life who can kill.

01:38:08.106 --> 01:38:10.074
But there aren't any
killers I trust

01:38:10.075 --> 01:38:12.009
other than Jack,
but I'm not so sure anymore.

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:13.711
I think the guy's gone
soft in the head.

01:38:13.712 --> 01:38:16.714
And he's probably gone
soft in the dick too.

01:38:16.715 --> 01:38:20.483
So I would like you
to overexert him.

01:38:21.786 --> 01:38:24.589
I could save you a lot
of time and trouble.

01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:27.390
Whatever you need
Jack for I can handle.

01:38:29.094 --> 01:38:31.629
Now, if only that were true.

01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:35.431
Unfortunately,
my six-foot chameleon,

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.735
it isn't.

01:38:37.736 --> 01:38:40.303
Well, he better be cute then.

01:38:41.906 --> 01:38:43.774
I think he looks like a fucking,

01:38:43.775 --> 01:38:45.543
average chipmunk,
but what do I know?

01:38:45.544 --> 01:38:48.813
One thing I do know,
the guy's a killing machine.

01:38:48.814 --> 01:38:50.180
But he's a sap.

01:38:50.948 --> 01:38:53.017
So I want you to give him the whole

01:38:53.018 --> 01:38:55.553
Jack-I've-gotten-myself-
into-so-much-trouble

01:38:55.554 --> 01:38:57.822
can-you-please-help-me-out routine.

01:38:57.823 --> 01:39:00.558
That I can do.

01:39:00.559 --> 01:39:02.458
And, baby...

01:39:03.294 --> 01:39:06.030
And, baby, if this gets fucked up,

01:39:06.031 --> 01:39:10.768
this goes South or something
goes wrong and I die,

01:39:10.769 --> 01:39:13.403
I want you to snuff Jack.

01:39:14.839 --> 01:39:16.941
Kill him?

01:39:16.942 --> 01:39:21.879
In the unlikely event that this
guy somehow manages to kill me,

01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.181
which would actually prove
that he's considerably more

01:39:24.182 --> 01:39:26.884
capable than I suspect
he is at this point,

01:39:26.885 --> 01:39:29.587
I would want you to kill him.

01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:32.156
You know I'd avenge your death
just out of love, right?

01:39:32.157 --> 01:39:35.358
But a girl's gotta make a living.

01:39:37.228 --> 01:39:40.230
Don't worry, along with love,
you'll get $5 million.

01:39:41.666 --> 01:39:44.635
And you'll disappear, and
you'll live a long, sweet life.

01:39:44.636 --> 01:39:47.971
And you'll remember me when you
say your prayers at night.

01:39:50.241 --> 01:39:52.777
Go to my lawyer with
proof of Jack's death.

01:39:52.778 --> 01:39:55.313
He's a fucking stickler for detail.

01:39:55.314 --> 01:39:57.715
Come to think of it,
you might wanna

01:39:57.716 --> 01:39:59.916
consider bringing him
Jack's head in a bag.

01:40:02.853 --> 01:40:05.957
Come on, Mr. Fucking-
stickler-for-detail.

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.957
Let's you and me go for a ride.

01:40:08.893 --> 01:40:12.797
A ride? Where?

01:40:12.798 --> 01:40:15.066
Do I look like the
kind of girl who would

01:40:15.067 --> 01:40:17.367
walk around with a
human head in a bag?

01:40:20.004 --> 01:40:21.905
It's a little hard to say.

01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:28.079
You do look like a pretty tough
girl and you must have been

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.715
to have outlasted
both Jack and Dragna.

01:40:30.716 --> 01:40:32.750
You have no idea.

01:40:32.751 --> 01:40:35.186
Well, I have some idea that
you weren't a Girl Guide.

01:40:35.187 --> 01:40:37.086
I'm gonna be your tour guide.

01:40:41.325 --> 01:40:43.226
Are you crazy?

01:40:43.794 --> 01:40:45.194
I've been called worse.

01:40:45.997 --> 01:40:48.564
Come on.
Enough talk, let's go!

01:40:51.402 --> 01:40:54.905
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

01:40:54.906 --> 01:40:57.073
Let's just cut to the chase.

01:40:59.944 --> 01:41:04.148
You look like the sort of girl who
is going to be more than happy

01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:10.988
to carry $5 million in
cash and gold bullion.

01:41:10.989 --> 01:41:13.489
I didn't know I was
that transparent.

01:41:18.996 --> 01:41:21.497
You got room in that bag?
Oh, yeah.

01:41:36.313 --> 01:41:38.381
Nice doing business with you.

01:41:39.784 --> 01:41:44.687
You might wanna take what you've
left implanted in my wall.

01:41:45.022 --> 01:41:47.023
Keep it.

01:41:47.391 --> 01:41:49.258
Fair exchange.

01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:51.327
See you.
