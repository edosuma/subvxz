<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:01.933 --> 00:03.851
<i>Ryder's getting catfished and</i>
<i>he has no idea who's doing it,</i>

00:03.885 --> 00:05.602
<i>except he sort of knows</i>
<i>who's doing it 'cause when</i>

00:05.653 --> 00:07.387
<i>he called them, someone's</i>
<i>phone rang in the choir room,</i>

00:07.405 --> 00:08.872
<i>which means it's somebody</i>
<i>in Glee Club.</i>

00:08.907 --> 00:10.441
<i>Sue left McKinley to protect</i>
<i>Becky, which is crazy,</i>

00:10.492 --> 00:12.276
<i>and Santana's living in</i>
<i>New York with Kurt and Rachel,</i>

00:12.327 --> 00:14.394
<i>but she doesn't have a bedroom</i>
<i>and she doesn't go to NYADA,</i>

00:14.412 --> 00:15.846
<i>so what exactly</i>
<i>is she doing, anyway?</i>

00:15.880 --> 00:18.380
<i>And that's what you missed</i>

Hey, Kitty,
who are you texting?

00:40.171 --> 00:41.388
Let me see your phone.

00:41.439 --> 00:43.974
I'm playing 4 Pics 1 Word,
weirdo stalker.

00:44.008 --> 00:45.726
Do I need to get
a restraining order?

00:45.777 --> 00:47.645
Guys, we got a problem.

00:47.679 --> 00:49.863
Her name is Frida Romero.

00:49.898 --> 00:51.315
<i>With regionals only</i>
<i>a few weeks away,</i>

00:51.349 --> 00:53.200
<i>I went to scout out</i>
<i>the competition.</i>

00:53.234 --> 00:59.740
♪ The bombs bursting in air...

00:59.791 --> 01:01.542
The Hoosierdaddies have
a secret weapon.

01:01.576 --> 01:03.243
She's a tiny little sophomore,
never competed before,

01:03.294 --> 01:04.361
but her voice

01:04.396 --> 01:05.495
could fill an arena.

01:05.530 --> 01:06.580
I mean, it's big.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.365
And the only way to beat them

01:08.383 --> 01:09.533
is to be huge.

01:09.551 --> 01:10.867
I'm talking stadium huge.

01:10.885 --> 01:13.053
Epic songs
that will blow the heads

01:13.088 --> 01:15.089
off of 100,000 people at a time.

01:18.226 --> 01:20.010
Zombie apocalypse.

01:20.044 --> 01:21.044
Or Beyonce's halftime show.

01:22.263 --> 01:25.099
Children, this power outage

01:25.150 --> 01:27.017
is not an emergency.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.439
Nor is it an excuse to go
wilding through the hallways.

01:32.490 --> 01:36.076
While we're investigating
the root of this near calamity,

01:36.111 --> 01:38.412
classes will continue

01:38.446 --> 01:41.064
and your brains are to remain

01:41.082 --> 01:43.784
in the on positions.

01:43.835 --> 01:46.370
If the darkness persists,

01:46.404 --> 01:50.624
candles and flashlights
will be distributed based

01:50.675 --> 01:53.460
on grade point average.

01:53.511 --> 01:54.878
I now have to turn

01:54.912 --> 01:57.247
off the P.A. system

01:57.265 --> 02:00.934
so I can save
our precious generator resources

02:00.969 --> 02:03.103
for the coffee machine

02:03.138 --> 02:05.806
and my plug-in

02:05.857 --> 02:07.608
lower back vibrator.

02:07.642 --> 02:08.892
Okay, that puts a damper

02:08.925 --> 02:11.094
on our stadium songs.

02:11.112 --> 02:12.613
Time for a new
appropriate lesson.

02:12.647 --> 02:13.814
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:13.865 --> 02:16.225
it's unplugged week.

02:19.370 --> 02:21.605
I can't believe she
blew me off like that.

02:21.623 --> 02:22.939
Who? Katie?

02:22.957 --> 02:24.908
How do you even know
this person is a she?

02:24.942 --> 02:26.744
Or even a human?
Look, stop, all right?

02:26.778 --> 02:28.962
All I know is I've had this
really amazing connection.

02:28.997 --> 02:30.914
You've got to let this go, man.

02:30.948 --> 02:32.916
It's crazy.
You don't even know her.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.618
Look, you don't understand,
Jake.

02:34.636 --> 02:36.253
I've never felt
so close to someone.

02:36.287 --> 02:37.755
Look, I told her things

02:37.789 --> 02:40.457
about myself, about my past,

02:40.475 --> 02:41.925
I've never told anyone.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.143
Ever.

02:43.178 --> 02:44.478
If this were to get out...
Wait.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.963
I thought your biggest secret
was dyslexia.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.966
Well, what is it?

02:52.220 --> 02:53.470
I can't.

02:53.488 --> 02:54.805
Fine, dude, keep it all

02:54.823 --> 02:56.323
locked away
for a few more years,

02:56.357 --> 02:58.141
but it's not going away.

02:58.159 --> 02:59.860
Maybe you should think
about starting to share

02:59.911 --> 03:03.580
your deep, dark secrets
with people you actually know.

03:11.489 --> 03:13.457
Right? I found this
out by the Dumpster.

03:13.491 --> 03:14.825
With a little TLC

03:14.859 --> 03:17.294
and three clicks
from Kurt's ruby slippers,

03:17.328 --> 03:19.880
this bad boy
would be salvageable.

03:19.931 --> 03:22.833
Um, can you please take a seat, because Kurt and
I would like to have a conversation with you.

03:22.851 --> 03:24.885
All right, you know what, Rachel,
if you are still obsessing

03:24.936 --> 03:26.386
over what you're gonna sing
at your <i>Funny Girl</i> callback,

03:26.421 --> 03:28.138
may I suggest
your best jam ever,

03:28.172 --> 03:29.339
"Run, Joey, Run."

03:29.357 --> 03:30.674
We think you're throwing
your life away.

03:30.692 --> 03:32.659
It's bad enough you let

03:32.694 --> 03:33.861
those horny tourists
grope you for tips

03:33.895 --> 03:35.679
at that awful Coyote Ugly bar,

03:35.697 --> 03:37.180
but Tina just informed me

03:37.198 --> 03:40.067
that you are now a bouncer
at a lesbian beer garden?

03:40.101 --> 03:42.202
And you're a go-go girl.
A go-go girl!

03:42.237 --> 03:44.872
Oh, yeah, a girl-bar go-go girl.

03:44.906 --> 03:47.074
I am a cage dancer...
big difference.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.992
I'm dressed as Barbarella,
and I'm sorry,

03:49.026 --> 03:50.994
but some of us actually
need to work for a living.

03:51.029 --> 03:52.496
Okay, that's not the point.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.081
Okay, you're so talented,
Santana.

03:54.132 --> 03:55.666
You're, like,
the most talented person I know,

03:55.700 --> 03:57.217
obviously with the exception
of me and Kurt.

03:57.252 --> 03:59.086
But your voice, it's electric,

03:59.120 --> 04:01.371
and I would kill for
half of your dancing abilities.

04:01.389 --> 04:03.674
So I'm telling you
what you told me,

04:03.708 --> 04:06.059
which is that you just need to
stop and focus on your talent.

04:06.094 --> 04:08.345
Well, maybe I don't want to be
in <i>Funny Girl,</i> okay?

04:08.379 --> 04:11.899
Or be a singing waiter at
the Fire Island Pancake Shack.

04:11.933 --> 04:13.767
So why don't you just
stop trying to force

04:13.801 --> 04:16.435
all of your creaky
old-time Broadway dreams

04:16.487 --> 04:18.438
on to my amazingly
awesome dream.

04:18.488 --> 04:20.240
And what's that?

04:20.274 --> 04:24.228
I am trying to figure that out.

04:26.264 --> 04:27.581
What is so wrong with taking

04:27.615 --> 04:29.199
a little time
to figure things out?

04:29.233 --> 04:31.702
Nothing. But what about doing
something in the meantime?

04:31.736 --> 04:33.253
Like dance lessons?

04:33.288 --> 04:34.237
NYADA has a great
extension program

04:34.255 --> 04:36.089
for non-students.
Yeah.

04:36.124 --> 04:37.925
Something to keep
your motors revved,

04:37.959 --> 04:39.209
you know...
My "motor"

04:39.243 --> 04:41.211
is revved every night
that I cage dance.

04:41.245 --> 04:42.713
And while I appreciate
your pity,

04:42.747 --> 04:44.431
I don't really think
I need to be taking

04:44.465 --> 04:46.433
any advice from TV's <i>Blossom</i>

04:46.467 --> 04:49.219
and Lady Elaine Fairchilde.

04:49.253 --> 04:50.253
Would you take

04:50.271 --> 04:52.255
your chair with you?

04:55.693 --> 04:57.110
All right, I know
these conditions aren't ideal,

04:57.145 --> 04:59.763
but I want to thank you guys
for toughing it out.

04:59.781 --> 05:02.733
And we have our first volunteer,
who is going to show us

05:02.767 --> 05:06.119
how to get back to basics
and really strip it down.

05:06.154 --> 05:08.322
So, let's give it up for Sam.

05:08.373 --> 05:09.957
Right.

05:09.991 --> 05:11.825
Uh, take it away.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.493
Thanks.

05:13.544 --> 05:15.111
Um, well,

05:15.129 --> 05:17.447
when Mr. Shue started
talking about being big,

05:17.465 --> 05:19.616
I started thinking
about Phil Spector's

05:19.634 --> 05:22.135
legendary Wall of Sound,
and how he would use, like,

05:22.170 --> 05:23.503
thousands of instruments

05:23.554 --> 05:25.339
so his songs could really
fill a stadium.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.624
And then I started
thinking about stripping,

05:27.642 --> 05:28.759
um,

05:28.793 --> 05:30.010
out all that extra noise

05:30.061 --> 05:32.262
to get to the essence
of the song.

05:32.296 --> 05:35.933
Plus, my mom said that
I was conceived to this song,

05:35.967 --> 05:37.768
so I kind of literally
owe my existence

05:37.802 --> 05:38.969
to the Righteous Brothers.

05:38.987 --> 05:40.470

that we need for regionals.

07:31.299 --> 07:32.549
Good job, Sam.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.935
Um, next up, uh, Artie.

07:34.969 --> 07:37.521
Show us what you got.

07:40.858 --> 07:42.559
I'm sorry, Mr. Shue.

07:42.593 --> 07:44.561
I can't do Miguel
without my synth.

07:44.595 --> 07:46.613
I needs my synth!

07:46.647 --> 07:47.948
No, you needs to man up.

07:47.982 --> 07:49.933
Excuse me?

07:49.951 --> 07:51.785
You know how often
the power went off at my house,

07:51.819 --> 07:54.121
how many times my dad couldn't
afford to pay the stupid bill?

07:54.155 --> 07:56.289
Relax, dude. I had to entertain
my brother and sister

07:56.324 --> 07:57.791
with just my guitar
and my voice,

07:57.825 --> 07:59.326
and we didn't have any synth.

08:01.112 --> 08:02.946
I mean, like, I saw you
texting during my song,

08:02.964 --> 08:04.464
and it's not just you;
It's all of us.

08:04.499 --> 08:06.282
We're so focused
on being plugged in

08:06.300 --> 08:07.968
to the Twitterverse
and the Blogosphere

08:08.002 --> 08:11.138
that we don't appreciate what's
actually right in front of us.

08:11.172 --> 08:13.456
And I think that that's
just sad and lame.

08:17.645 --> 08:20.514
Great, so we'll include
a Blu-ray of <i>Black Swan,</i>

08:20.565 --> 08:23.316
um, in the gift bag and a note

08:23.351 --> 08:25.819
from the director,
"How Ballet Inspired Me."

08:25.853 --> 08:27.521
Oh, that's perfect.

08:27.572 --> 08:28.655
Thanks, Darren.

08:28.689 --> 08:29.990
I appreciate it.

08:30.024 --> 08:31.608
Oh, and, uh, listen,

08:31.642 --> 08:33.643
you're at my table,
seated next to Christopher.

08:33.660 --> 08:35.195
So be nice.

08:35.229 --> 08:37.697
All right, bye.

08:37.748 --> 08:38.982
Darren...?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.034
Aronofsky. Christopher Nolan.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.035
Oh.
You may be seated.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.507
So, first of all,
how is your dad?

08:47.542 --> 08:49.960
Oh, uh, thank you for asking.

08:49.994 --> 08:51.128
He's doing good.

08:51.162 --> 08:52.846
Um, he's back at work,

08:52.880 --> 08:54.848
and all his treatments
seem to be working.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.133
Good, I'm happy to hear that.

08:56.167 --> 08:58.001
I thought you might
have called me in here

08:58.019 --> 08:59.886
because, um,
you were gonna fire me.

08:59.921 --> 09:02.222
What? Why would I do that?

09:02.273 --> 09:04.691
When you gave me the internship,
you said it would be 24/7,

09:04.725 --> 09:06.226
and ever since
I got accepted to NYADA...

09:07.562 --> 09:09.479
You haven't been coming in
as much.

09:09.513 --> 09:10.564
We've noticed.

09:10.615 --> 09:11.848
But quality

09:11.883 --> 09:15.202
trumps quantity always.

09:15.236 --> 09:16.653
And though NYADA's gain

09:16.687 --> 09:20.023
is Vogue.com's loss,

09:20.041 --> 09:24.711
I will never stop anyone
from pursuing their passion.

09:24.745 --> 09:26.029
But I need your help.

09:26.047 --> 09:27.714
You know I'm co-chairing
the gala

09:27.748 --> 09:30.333
for New York City Ballet's
educational programs?

09:30.367 --> 09:33.220
Yeah, it's only <i>the</i> social event
of the performing arts season.

09:33.254 --> 09:35.338
My celebrity wrangler
just canceled.

09:35.373 --> 09:36.873
It was going
to be Anna's daughter,

09:36.908 --> 09:40.010
but she got the chicken pox
à la Barbara Walters.

09:40.044 --> 09:41.595
So I need somebody.

09:41.629 --> 09:43.346
I need somebody good

09:43.381 --> 09:45.565
who can dive in ASAP.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.602
If anyone else does this,
I-I will literally die.

09:48.636 --> 09:50.070
Okay. All right.
Yes.

09:50.104 --> 09:52.022
And listen, um,
if you want to draft

09:52.056 --> 09:53.723
a couple of friends
to help you out,

09:53.741 --> 09:55.242
that's good, too.
Yeah?

09:58.410 --> 09:59.961

Fact, if I hadn't mistaken you

for a butch Israeli girl,

11:24.263 --> 11:25.830
I would've never
let you in here.

11:25.865 --> 11:29.634
B, the fact that
you survived my boot camp 101,

11:29.668 --> 11:32.470
also known as Sue 90X,
trademark pending,

11:32.504 --> 11:33.855
I will allow you to speak.

11:33.889 --> 11:34.856
Just don't sing.

11:34.890 --> 11:36.474
I'll admit,

11:36.508 --> 11:39.310
I rejoined the Cheerios
with the sole plan

11:39.344 --> 11:41.012
of destroying you
from the inside.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.981
Admirable. But now that
you're gone, I can see

11:43.015 --> 11:44.682
that all the Cheerio girls
are lost without you,

11:44.700 --> 11:46.034
and frankly,
as student council president,

11:46.068 --> 11:47.569
I'm a little worried

11:47.620 --> 11:49.404
about the kind of advice
Coach Roz is giving.

11:49.455 --> 11:51.573
And that is why
you all signed up

11:51.624 --> 11:52.907
with Dr. Fong to get

11:52.958 --> 11:54.376
a couple of those fatty ribs

11:54.410 --> 11:55.410
removed for flexibility.

11:55.461 --> 11:56.711
What?

11:56.746 --> 11:58.380
You know, I always thought

11:58.414 --> 11:59.914
Becky could look like
a young Dolly Parton

11:59.965 --> 12:01.416
with a couple less ribs.

12:01.467 --> 12:02.717
Something went down
at that school,

12:02.752 --> 12:04.502
and it has something
to do with you.

12:04.536 --> 12:06.037
Someway, somehow,

12:06.055 --> 12:08.223
the kids are still shaken up.
No one feels safe.

12:08.257 --> 12:10.208
Set the record straight.

12:10.226 --> 12:12.427
We need you, Coach Sue.

12:20.936 --> 12:22.887
Hey.

12:22.905 --> 12:25.273
I was thinking about what you
said, and you're totally right.

12:25.324 --> 12:26.741
I kind of got inspired

12:26.776 --> 12:28.777
when I was rolling down
the hallway in between classes.

12:36.568 --> 12:38.203
And the sound it made
was almost musical,

12:38.237 --> 12:40.755
and it got me thinking; we don't
have to have electricity

12:40.790 --> 12:42.707
to make music. We don't
even need real instruments.

12:42.741 --> 12:44.209
I didn't say you couldn't
use instruments. I was...

12:44.243 --> 12:46.211
I know, but think about it.
We want to win regionals,

12:46.245 --> 12:47.762
and we're gonna have
to do it as a team.

12:47.797 --> 12:50.448
And imagine how we could get
everybody working together

12:50.483 --> 12:52.550
if we pushed ourselves to
pull off a song with nothing

12:52.584 --> 12:56.304
but a water bottle and
pencils and a zipper,

12:56.355 --> 12:58.256
and who knows what else.
You want unplugged.

12:58.274 --> 13:00.091
This would be unplugged squared.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.943
I like it.

13:01.977 --> 13:03.928
Ladies?

13:04.780 --> 13:06.281
What is the event

13:06.315 --> 13:08.766
the Big Apple's hoi polloi
must be invited to

13:08.784 --> 13:10.151
or they'll pull a Javert

13:10.202 --> 13:11.903
and swan dive off the
Chrysler Building?

13:11.937 --> 13:13.238
The New York City
Ballet Gala, duh.

13:13.272 --> 13:15.323
And guess who gets to attend

13:15.374 --> 13:17.792
if they just volunteer a few short hours?
Anne Hathaway?

13:17.827 --> 13:19.327
It's us, it's us!
Are you serious?

13:19.378 --> 13:21.496
And just when you thought
it couldn't get any gayer,

13:21.547 --> 13:22.630
it does.

13:22.665 --> 13:23.965
Make fun of it all you want,

13:23.999 --> 13:25.483
but the New York City
Ballet Gala,

13:25.518 --> 13:27.135
it's a celebration
of a timeless art.

13:27.169 --> 13:30.138
If it wasn't for ballet,
I wouldn't be here.

13:30.172 --> 13:32.474
<i>It was my gateway</i>
<i>into show business.</i>

13:32.508 --> 13:35.593
<i>My dance teacher told me that</i>
<i>I was a mini Margot Fonteyn.</i>

13:35.627 --> 13:37.128
<i>She taught me the power</i>
<i>of music,</i>

13:37.146 --> 13:38.746
<i>and although that dance studio</i>

13:38.781 --> 13:42.800
<i>was just a tiny,</i>
<i>moldy Lima storefront,</i>

13:42.818 --> 13:45.153
<i>to me, it was the most</i>
<i>beautiful place on earth.</i>

13:45.187 --> 13:46.821
I started ballet

13:46.856 --> 13:48.940
at the ripe old age of three.

13:48.974 --> 13:51.809
<i>My mom enrolled me after</i>
<i>seeing me in front of the TV,</i>

13:51.827 --> 13:54.662
<i>jetéing and debouléeing</i>
<i>to the</i> Blues Clues <i>theme song.</i>

13:54.697 --> 13:56.831
<i>That ballet class was</i>
<i>one of the few places</i>

13:56.866 --> 13:58.449
<i>that just seemed to fit.</i>

13:58.483 --> 14:00.285
<i>And even when I saw</i>
<i>some of the kids</i>

14:00.319 --> 14:01.619
<i>and their parents</i>
<i>laughing at me,</i>

14:01.653 --> 14:02.770
<i>something inside</i>
<i>my little brain said,</i>

14:02.805 --> 14:04.172
<i>"Screw them.</i>

14:04.206 --> 14:05.874
<i>Just go for it, Hummel."</i>

14:05.925 --> 14:08.209
<i>My can-do attitude</i>
<i>was born in that room.</i>

14:08.260 --> 14:10.178
And I skipped all that crap

14:10.212 --> 14:12.330
to study the timeless art
of crunk.

14:12.348 --> 14:14.132
Look, you can tell Isabelle
that I am definitely in.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.000
Not me, count me out.

14:16.018 --> 14:18.553
You mean you don't want
to wear a designer dress

14:18.604 --> 14:20.188
from the legendary
Vogue.com vault

14:20.222 --> 14:21.806
that you get to keep as a gift?

14:21.840 --> 14:23.725
I'm in.

14:23.776 --> 14:24.776
She's in.
She's in.

14:25.611 --> 14:27.028
I know these songs are

14:27.062 --> 14:28.679
supposed to be unplugged,
but I asked Mr. Shue

14:28.697 --> 14:29.864
permission to do
a full orchestration.

14:29.899 --> 14:30.982
Which I gladly agreed to,

14:31.016 --> 14:32.150
because Ryder eloquently told me

14:32.184 --> 14:33.151
that what he wanted to unplug

14:33.185 --> 14:34.736
were his feelings.

14:34.787 --> 14:36.821
I want to really reveal myself
through this song.

14:36.855 --> 14:38.189
And frankly, I think

14:38.207 --> 14:39.874
I kind of need the support
to get there.

14:39.909 --> 14:41.859
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of us,

14:41.877 --> 14:44.045
and for all the slushees...
real and proverbial...

14:44.079 --> 14:47.215

That was amazing, Ryder.

17:08.272 --> 17:09.390
You certainly unplugged

17:09.441 --> 17:11.342
whatever you were looking
to let out.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.644
I didn't want
to just get them out.

17:13.678 --> 17:15.346
I wanted to get
in touch with them

17:15.364 --> 17:18.348
so I could maybe have the balls
to tell you guys something.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.483
Something that's pretty hard

17:19.518 --> 17:21.234
to talk about.

17:21.286 --> 17:22.704
It's cool, bro.
You can let it out.

17:22.738 --> 17:25.406
I've actually only told
one person this.

17:25.457 --> 17:27.191
Not even my parents know.

17:28.292 --> 17:30.194
But...

17:30.212 --> 17:33.531
I'm not sure if I could trust
that person to keep it secret.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.084
So before this gets out,

17:36.135 --> 17:39.721
I want to be the one
to open the box.

17:41.223 --> 17:44.892
When I was 11,
I was molested by my babysitter.

17:48.731 --> 17:51.065
She just walked in on me
in the shower,

17:51.100 --> 17:53.518
and she touched me a bit.

17:53.552 --> 17:56.053
Wait, hold on.
Did you just say "she"?

17:56.071 --> 17:57.939
Like, as in a girl?
Like, a teenage girl?

17:57.990 --> 18:00.358
Yeah, she was, like, 17, 18.

18:00.392 --> 18:01.442
Dude,

18:01.493 --> 18:02.777
you were 11

18:02.828 --> 18:04.445
and some hot 18-year-old
plays with your junk?

18:04.496 --> 18:06.114
I'd have killed for that.

18:06.165 --> 18:08.199
Why are you ashamed of this?

18:08.233 --> 18:09.951
I don't know, I...

18:10.002 --> 18:11.919
It kind of messed me up a bit.

18:11.954 --> 18:13.204
Like, I have trouble
trusting girls

18:13.238 --> 18:14.672
because of it, I think.

18:14.706 --> 18:16.240
Guys, this is not something
to high-five about.

18:16.258 --> 18:18.593
Ryder, I'm sorry,
but I'm obligated to report it.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.044
Whatever,
she already got locked up.

18:20.078 --> 18:21.712
She was caught doing it
to some other kid.

18:21.746 --> 18:23.747
Okay, I'm sorry, but
why-why is that a crime?

18:23.766 --> 18:25.383
I mean, it's every
teenage boy's fantasy.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.084
I mean, there's, like, 50
'80s movies about it.

18:27.102 --> 18:28.553
I mean, <i>My Tutor,</i>

18:28.587 --> 18:29.887
<i>Private Lessons, Gym Class...</i>

18:29.921 --> 18:31.222
We get it, Sam, thanks.

18:31.256 --> 18:33.257
Guys, this is so uncool.

18:33.275 --> 18:34.642
His truth is his truth,
not yours.

18:34.693 --> 18:35.777
You know what,
it's cool, okay?

18:35.811 --> 18:37.895
Uh, the guys are right.

18:37.929 --> 18:39.947
I don't know what
I was thinking.

18:39.982 --> 18:41.816
Uh, I'm, like,
the luckiest guy in here.

18:41.867 --> 18:43.234
So...

18:43.268 --> 18:45.987
You know, yeah.

18:46.038 --> 18:47.605
Good job.
Thanks.

18:47.623 --> 18:50.625
I mean, kid clearly has
superior game.

18:59.148 --> 19:00.849
You know, I was
sort of surprised when

19:00.900 --> 19:02.684
you asked me to dinner,
'cause I know you're, like,

19:02.735 --> 19:04.402
dating Jake's brother
and everything.

19:04.437 --> 19:06.071
Puck and I broke up.

19:06.105 --> 19:07.655
He dumped me when he went off

19:07.690 --> 19:09.507
to live at a college
he doesn't go to.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.659
From a distance,
Puck is super hot,

19:11.694 --> 19:13.695
but you don't really realize
until you're right up close

19:13.746 --> 19:15.146
how puffy he is.

19:15.803 --> 19:16.655
Here you go.

19:18.834 --> 19:20.985
I don't know why I have
such terrible luck

19:21.003 --> 19:22.921
with guys.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.156
It's probably because I come on
really strong

19:25.174 --> 19:26.674
and pretend to be all slutty,

19:26.709 --> 19:28.159
and then I freeze up right away

19:28.177 --> 19:31.429
and get distant
and drop weird hints

19:31.464 --> 19:33.431
that my vagina has teeth.

19:33.466 --> 19:35.600
But I didn't come here

19:35.634 --> 19:37.268
to talk about
the razor-sharp barbs

19:37.303 --> 19:38.553
guarding my cervix.

19:39.722 --> 19:42.173
I noticed how withdrawn you got
this week

19:42.191 --> 19:44.442
in Glee Club after you told
everyone your secret.

19:44.477 --> 19:46.444
It may have seemed
like no one else

19:46.479 --> 19:48.780
in that room understood
what you went through,

19:48.814 --> 19:50.365
but...

19:50.399 --> 19:52.650
I did.

19:55.821 --> 19:59.357
It was, um, my friend
Julie's older brother.

19:59.391 --> 20:01.209
I was in sixth grade.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.211
One night,

20:03.245 --> 20:05.880
Julie had a sleepover,

20:05.915 --> 20:09.084
and in the middle of the night,

20:09.135 --> 20:11.803
he came down into the basement

20:11.837 --> 20:15.706
and crawled
into my sleeping bag.

20:15.724 --> 20:17.475
At first, I thought
it was a joke.

20:17.510 --> 20:19.710
I didn't know
what was happening.

20:19.728 --> 20:23.398
But then he started, um...

20:23.432 --> 20:27.402
to feel me in places.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.154
In the morning,
I went straight home

20:29.188 --> 20:30.738
without saying good-bye,

20:30.773 --> 20:33.908
and I couldn't tell my parents
for a while.

20:33.943 --> 20:35.243
I was afraid

20:35.277 --> 20:37.495
of upsetting them or something.

20:37.530 --> 20:40.081
So when I did tell them,

20:40.116 --> 20:41.749
they were really confused.

20:41.784 --> 20:45.920
They didn't understand
why I waited so long

20:45.955 --> 20:47.738
to say something about it.

20:47.756 --> 20:49.407
My mom called his parents,

20:49.425 --> 20:51.092
and all I could hear her say

20:51.127 --> 20:53.595
was how good of a kid he was
and how she didn't

20:53.629 --> 20:56.131
know how something
like that could happen.

20:57.967 --> 21:00.685
And then Julie
stopped talking to me

21:00.719 --> 21:02.253
and told everyone at school

21:02.271 --> 21:04.189
that I was spreading rumors
about her brother.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.107
Then she told all my friends

21:06.142 --> 21:07.358
to stop talking to me.

21:07.393 --> 21:08.943
Finally,

21:08.978 --> 21:12.280
I just decided it'd just
be easier to switch schools.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.315
So I did.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.486
I understand what it feels like

21:18.537 --> 21:20.288
to have something
like that happen to you

21:20.322 --> 21:22.657
and feel like
nobody understands.

21:24.043 --> 21:27.879
I guess I just wanted you
to know that...

21:27.913 --> 21:30.415
I do.

21:36.639 --> 21:38.473

Hi, Coach.

23:32.304 --> 23:34.088
Can I watch it with you?

23:34.123 --> 23:35.740
Jackson, you are out of uniform.

23:35.758 --> 23:38.843
I was thinking of
quitting the team.

23:38.877 --> 23:42.797
I can't stand how
Coach Roz treats me.

23:42.848 --> 23:45.082
Maybe the fact that you grew
from an itty-bitty fetus

23:45.100 --> 23:47.585
into a full-size adult
in less than a calendar year

23:47.603 --> 23:49.086
has made you cocky,
Robin Sylvester,

23:49.104 --> 23:51.189
but around here,
we like our protein shakes

23:51.223 --> 23:52.857
to taste like human food

23:52.891 --> 23:55.310
and not some crazy
peanut butter stem cell sauce

23:55.361 --> 23:58.429
you cooked up on
your Island of Dr. Moreau!

23:58.447 --> 24:01.265
Well, I have always admired
her run-on sentences.

24:01.283 --> 24:03.434
Coach, please come back.

24:03.452 --> 24:05.936
I know you did this
to protect me.

24:05.954 --> 24:07.104
I'm sorry.

24:07.122 --> 24:08.823
I miss you so bad it hurts.

24:08.874 --> 24:11.492
Oh, honey, I miss you, too.

this is the best thing

As a trainer,
people take me seriously.

24:23.138 --> 24:27.458
95 years I gave those girls,
and what did it get me?

24:27.476 --> 24:29.677
Certainly not their respect.

24:29.728 --> 24:33.964
Just a sad, lazy grab bag
of quitters, backstabbers,

24:33.982 --> 24:36.901
flip-floppers,
lipstick lesbians

24:36.935 --> 24:40.571
and ungrateful, sloppy,
knocked-up sluts.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.690

about Cherry Jones?

Whatevs.

26:56.371 --> 26:58.122

26:58.156 --> 27:00.290
I know that we're
just volunteers here,

27:00.325 --> 27:02.526
but Kurt and I were wondering
if there was any possibility

27:02.544 --> 27:04.745
that we could maybe watch the
performance from the audience.

27:04.796 --> 27:07.197
Absolutely not.

27:07.215 --> 27:09.366
I'm sorry.

27:09.384 --> 27:12.719
You're gonna be watching
from the wings with me.

doesn't like ballet.

starts out wanting to be
a ballerina.

27:27.435 --> 27:29.403

We've discussed it.

at the hospital, he said,

31:11.793 --> 31:15.779
"Well, I thought this was
gonna help, but I guess not."

31:15.797 --> 31:19.666
A few months later, he left.

31:19.717 --> 31:22.285
And he never came back.

31:22.303 --> 31:24.388
Anyway,

31:24.422 --> 31:28.558
I had this
fantastic fantasy life.

31:28.593 --> 31:30.794
I used to dance
around the living room

31:30.812 --> 31:32.962
with my arms up like this.

31:32.980 --> 31:36.900
And in my fantasy,
there was an Indian chief,

31:36.934 --> 31:38.968
and he would say to me,

31:38.986 --> 31:42.972
"Izzy, do you
want to dance?"

31:42.990 --> 31:45.826
And I would say, "Daddy",

31:45.860 --> 31:48.278
I would love to dance."

31:49.530 --> 31:50.814

33:35.887 --> 33:39.255
Sorry.

33:39.273 --> 33:41.257
Listen, I really love dancing.

33:41.275 --> 33:43.310
I just am not like you guys.

33:43.361 --> 33:46.146
I don't know what I want to do
or how I'm even gonna get there.

33:46.197 --> 33:49.098
But you have plenty of time
to figure it out.

33:49.116 --> 33:53.620
And... it doesn't have to be
ballet or Broadway,

33:53.654 --> 33:56.323
just as long as
it's something that you love,

33:56.374 --> 33:59.492
something that feeds your soul.

33:59.544 --> 34:02.232
And, Santana,
baby steps are okay.

34:10.838 --> 34:13.806
Sue's adult baby is being
a belligerent pain in my booty,

34:13.841 --> 34:15.859
and I am not
gonna take it anymore!

34:15.893 --> 34:18.395
First she started making fart
noises every time I bent over.

34:18.446 --> 34:20.362
Then she started
making fart noises

34:20.398 --> 34:22.232
every time I blinked.

34:22.283 --> 34:25.485
Ain't nobody fart every time
they blink... that's crazy!

34:25.518 --> 34:26.652
Then Robin Sylvester

34:26.687 --> 34:29.039
called me "Coach Chocolate Pie."

34:29.072 --> 34:30.373
I marched her

34:30.408 --> 34:31.658
down here so <i>you</i> can

34:31.692 --> 34:33.710
decide what to do with her.

34:33.745 --> 34:35.545
It's your problem!

34:38.466 --> 34:40.382
Becky Jackson,

34:40.418 --> 34:42.002
you can't insult

34:42.036 --> 34:46.656
the sultry and mysterious
Coach Roz Washington.

34:46.690 --> 34:48.041
She is

34:48.059 --> 34:50.342
an African-American treasure.

34:50.377 --> 34:54.598
I only misbehaved so she'd
send me here to talk to you.

34:54.649 --> 34:56.850
Why didn't you just
come here yourself?

34:56.884 --> 34:58.435
I didn't think of that.

35:00.154 --> 35:04.224
Principal Figgins,
I need to tell you something.

35:15.903 --> 35:17.871
Citizens of McKinley,

35:17.905 --> 35:20.290
the power has been restored.

35:20.324 --> 35:22.542
Congratulations to all of us

35:22.576 --> 35:25.262
for refusing to resort
to idol worship

35:25.296 --> 35:27.697
and rampant cannibalism.

35:27.732 --> 35:30.917
We have discovered
that the blackout occurred

35:30.935 --> 35:32.769
when a Mylar balloon

35:32.804 --> 35:35.438
congratulating
my secretary Donna

35:35.473 --> 35:37.774
on her successful hysterectomy

35:37.809 --> 35:40.227
became trapped in an outlet

35:40.261 --> 35:43.380
behind her file cabinet.

35:43.414 --> 35:47.317
McKinley Titans,
it is a new dawn.

35:47.351 --> 35:51.938
Let us welcome a new era
of peace and prosperity.

35:51.956 --> 35:55.108
Yours truly, Principal Figgins.

36:04.618 --> 36:07.304
Okay, let's flip some switches

36:07.338 --> 36:08.672
and rock out, please.

36:08.723 --> 36:09.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, guys.

36:09.957 --> 36:11.091
Don't plug back in just yet.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.475
There's one more thing

36:12.510 --> 36:14.160
this power outage
can really drive home for us:

36:14.195 --> 36:15.262
The power

36:15.296 --> 36:16.963
of singing a capella.

36:16.981 --> 36:18.265
I hate whistling.

36:18.299 --> 36:20.100
Nothing but our voices
for this next number.

36:20.134 --> 36:23.854
No other instruments
or bottles or tools or anything.

36:23.888 --> 36:25.856
At the end of the day,
our voices

36:25.907 --> 36:27.741
are the only instruments
that truly matter.

36:28.809 --> 36:30.677
So make it count.

37:44.468 --> 37:46.853
Hey, son of Frankenteen.
I just started the Subway diet,

37:46.887 --> 37:48.738
and it's time for my second
five-dollar foot-long.

37:48.773 --> 37:50.190
Want to buy it for me?

37:50.224 --> 37:51.858
Um...

37:51.892 --> 37:53.193
I'm kidding.

37:53.227 --> 37:54.778
Come on, I'll buy you a sub.

37:54.829 --> 37:56.696
I have, like, 20 more
humiliating stories to tell you.

37:56.730 --> 37:59.015
That sounds awesome,
but... I can't.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.300
Kind of have a date.

38:00.334 --> 38:01.351
With who?

38:01.385 --> 38:03.920
Katie.
The catfish?

38:03.955 --> 38:06.873
How can you pick an online
fantasy over an actual fantasy?

38:06.907 --> 38:09.209
She's not a fantasy.
She's a projection.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.460
She's whatever
you want her to be.

38:10.511 --> 38:12.212
Why do you think
you get along so well?

38:12.246 --> 38:14.631
You have no real intimacy
with this person.

38:14.682 --> 38:16.549
Stop embarrassing yourself
and come have lunch with me.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.435
Look, I get that
this seems a little kooky,

38:18.469 --> 38:20.253
and part of me
really wants to go

38:20.271 --> 38:22.055
with you right now,
but I'm sorry.

38:22.089 --> 38:25.091
I don't warm to people
easily, and...

38:25.109 --> 38:27.394
I was really starting
to like you.

38:27.428 --> 38:29.762
Maybe after I find out
who Katie is

38:29.780 --> 38:32.983
and we straighten all this out,
we could go out then.

38:33.034 --> 38:34.767
I don't think so.

38:50.977 --> 38:52.978
I hope that...

38:55.866 --> 38:57.149
You're late.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.818
I like to make an entrance.

38:58.869 --> 39:00.602
And if
we're really gonna talk

39:00.620 --> 39:02.037
about late, can you say
something to Gramps right here?

39:02.072 --> 39:03.038
Sit.

39:03.073 --> 39:04.290
Excuse me.

39:04.324 --> 39:06.158
This is NYADA Extension.

39:06.209 --> 39:08.461
You sign up,
you pay, you get in.

39:08.495 --> 39:10.129
Anyone.

39:10.163 --> 39:12.114
And what I was going to say was

39:12.132 --> 39:15.117
that I hope none of you
came here expecting

39:15.135 --> 39:17.452
that it would help you
get into NYADA as a student.

39:17.471 --> 39:19.472
Good. 'Cause the last thing
I want to do

39:19.506 --> 39:22.457
is pay 30 grand a year to get
a degree for doing something

39:22.476 --> 39:24.226
that I'm already
freakin' Wonder Woman at.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.262
Then what are you doing here?

39:29.316 --> 39:31.901
I love to dance.

39:31.935 --> 39:33.819
I'm an artist, but...

39:33.854 --> 39:37.039
I sort of lost touch
with that part of myself lately,

39:37.073 --> 39:41.443
and so I'm here to...
do some reintroducing.

39:42.779 --> 39:44.780
I can dig that.

39:45.832 --> 39:47.482
Everybody up.

39:47.501 --> 39:50.485
To the bar. Pliés, please.

39:50.504 --> 39:52.654
Two demi, one grand,
port de bras forward.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.645
Don't forget me again, okay?

40:17.697 --> 40:20.015
I won't.

40:20.033 --> 40:21.567
I promise.

40:26.656 --> 40:29.124
I've got you now.
