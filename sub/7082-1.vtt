03:26.023 --> 03:28.566
Oh. Father Tim.

03:28.611 --> 03:29.655
Sorry to interrupt, but...

03:29.701 --> 03:31.471
Sarah, you're here
again tonight?

03:31.516 --> 03:34.559
Sarah's always helping out
during the holidays.

03:34.604 --> 03:36.510
Any update from
that new couple?

03:36.556 --> 03:38.963
-New couple? -The one's
relocating from Birmingham.

03:39.008 --> 03:41.822
Mom teaches at Reed,
stay-at-home dad, two kids.

03:41.868 --> 03:42.912
Loves to salsa.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.501
Ah, yes, the Jensens.

03:44.545 --> 03:46.272
<i>Sarah's also
our resident realtor.</i>

03:46.316 --> 03:48.132
Guilty.

03:48.178 --> 03:50.175
Sarah Fitzpatrick.
Dingo Realty.

03:50.221 --> 03:52.445
Making dreams come true
in the greater Portland area

03:52.490 --> 03:54.351
since 2008.

03:55.352 --> 03:57.531
Your company ate my baby.

04:00.526 --> 04:03.341
Meryl Streep, "Dingo Realty."

04:03.385 --> 04:06.428
Oh, right.
Yeah, not that "Dingo."

04:06.472 --> 04:08.244
Is there another kind?

04:08.289 --> 04:10.332
I think the partners just wanted
a made-up name like Google,

04:10.378 --> 04:12.465
that'd appeal to a
younger demographic.

04:12.511 --> 04:15.234
Ah, except
it's an actual mammal.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.688
I don't name 'em,
I just sell 'em.

04:18.731 --> 04:21.363
I haven't had a chance to talk to
them about their living arrangements.

04:21.409 --> 04:22.953
Well, I've got
this perfect Victorian

04:22.997 --> 04:24.769
in Healy Heights,
but it's gonna go fast.

04:24.814 --> 04:25.859
It'd be perfect for them.

04:25.904 --> 04:28.083
Kid friendly, move-in ready.

04:28.127 --> 04:30.534
Just let me know, and I can get
them in right after New Years.

04:30.580 --> 04:32.713
-Will do.
-Okay.

04:32.759 --> 04:35.164
-Merry Christmas.
-God bless.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.501
You want a blanket?

04:59.044 --> 05:00.679
Hello?

05:02.540 --> 05:03.902
Are you okay?

05:05.218 --> 05:06.807
Would you like
another blanket?

05:06.853 --> 05:09.168
Or maybe some coffee?

05:09.213 --> 05:11.029
It's cold out tonight.

05:11.075 --> 05:12.528
I lost her.

05:12.572 --> 05:14.525
Who?

05:14.570 --> 05:18.428
Fiona.

05:18.474 --> 05:20.517
Fiona, is that your wife?

05:20.562 --> 05:24.331
No, it's my... It's my dog.

05:24.376 --> 05:26.237
Let me see if I can find her.

05:26.283 --> 05:27.963
I'm sure she didn't go far.

05:29.278 --> 05:30.549
Would you?

05:32.456 --> 05:35.135
Now, you stay warm
and don't go anywhere.

05:35.181 --> 05:37.268
I don't want
to lose you and Fiona.

05:39.221 --> 05:40.401
Thank you.

05:43.806 --> 05:45.350
Fiona?

05:48.119 --> 05:51.388
Fiona?

06:01.512 --> 06:03.963
Ugh, really?

06:09.819 --> 06:11.816
Fiona?

06:19.670 --> 06:21.078
Here, Fiona.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.665
Where are you?

06:24.755 --> 06:25.980
I've got a treat.

06:28.205 --> 06:30.566
Oh.

06:31.928 --> 06:33.789
I found you.

06:35.288 --> 06:39.009
There you are.
Come here, Fiona.

07:24.770 --> 07:26.133
Hi.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.130
Welcome.

07:28.176 --> 07:30.082
Hi, I don't know
exactly where,

07:30.128 --> 07:32.534
or what...

07:33.760 --> 07:35.213
what exactly
is happening?

07:36.302 --> 07:38.345
Oh, wow.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.297
Thank you.

07:43.384 --> 07:44.883
Are you kidding?

07:44.927 --> 07:46.244
Meow.

07:46.290 --> 07:48.604
Isn't he just dreamy?

07:48.650 --> 07:50.193
Could I get a name, hon?

07:50.239 --> 07:53.508
What?
Oh, it's Sarah Fitzpatrick.

07:53.553 --> 07:54.597
And your friend?

07:54.643 --> 07:56.413
Fiona.

07:56.459 --> 07:57.866
Oh, great.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.136
Let me just check
our reservations.

08:00.181 --> 08:02.360
Where am I exactly?

08:02.406 --> 08:05.039
Oh, yes,
of course, sweetie,

08:05.084 --> 08:08.989
you've had quite a journey,
haven't you?

08:09.035 --> 08:12.802
Welcome to The Lobby.

08:15.934 --> 08:17.569
Did you guys just open?

08:17.614 --> 08:19.884
'Cause I know all the
hip places in Portland,

08:19.930 --> 08:21.927
and this doesn't
look familiar at all.

08:21.972 --> 08:24.333
You don't
remember anything?

08:24.379 --> 08:25.560
No.

08:26.830 --> 08:29.191
Wait, yes.

08:29.235 --> 08:32.777
There were lights...
and sound...

08:32.823 --> 08:34.865
I picked up Fiona, and...

08:36.953 --> 08:37.996
Am I...

08:38.043 --> 08:39.496
Dead? Yes.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.220
I'm afraid so, sweetie.

08:43.173 --> 08:46.578
And your little dog too!

08:47.758 --> 08:49.438
I just always wanted
to do that.

08:49.484 --> 08:51.753
So, this is Heaven?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.433
No, no, no.

08:53.479 --> 08:55.885
No, this is
just the lobby.

08:55.930 --> 09:00.606
You know,
halfway, limbo.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.285
Purgatory.
Oh, I hate calling it that.

09:03.421 --> 09:06.417
It's just so medieval.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.915
Yeah, no,

09:07.961 --> 09:11.410
Heaven is straight
through those gates.

09:11.456 --> 09:15.315
But you know, we can't
just let everyone in.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.221
They have to
be on the list.

09:17.267 --> 09:18.948
I can't believe
this is happening.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.760
Aw, I understand.
It can be traumatic.

09:22.805 --> 09:24.213
Are you kidding?

09:24.258 --> 09:26.619
I've dreamt about this
my whole life!

09:26.664 --> 09:28.708
I always knew it
would be like this.

09:28.753 --> 09:31.795
Beautiful, serene, trendy.

09:33.201 --> 09:35.109
Wait, I thought
St. Peter was a guy.

09:35.154 --> 09:40.147
Yeah, he's been gone
for at least 100 years.

09:40.193 --> 09:42.145
And frankly,
I'm getting a little tired

09:42.190 --> 09:44.733
of hearing about it.

09:44.778 --> 09:47.820
People have such
antiquated gender concepts

09:47.865 --> 09:50.135
about angels
in management positions.

09:50.181 --> 09:51.315
You're an angel?

09:52.678 --> 09:54.493
I can't believe
I'm talking to an angel.

09:54.539 --> 09:59.169
A grand arch angel, actually.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.757
but you can call me Daphne.

10:02.846 --> 10:04.118
Now, let's get you in.

10:04.163 --> 10:06.433
Don't wanna miss
your reservation.

10:07.477 --> 10:08.703
Oh.

10:08.748 --> 10:10.701
What? It's okay if
I have to hang a bit.

10:10.745 --> 10:12.652
You know, this
place is incredible.

10:12.698 --> 10:14.740
And those snacks...

10:14.786 --> 10:16.148
I'm not seeing
you on here.

10:16.193 --> 10:18.008
Oh, it's Fitzpatrick.

10:18.054 --> 10:19.280
-With a "Z."
-Hmm.

10:19.325 --> 10:20.960
What? What's wrong?

10:21.006 --> 10:25.319
I can't let you in,
if you're not on the list.

10:25.364 --> 10:27.407
What do you mean,
"not on the list"?

10:27.452 --> 10:29.495
I... I just saved a dog
in the freezing cold.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.673
Mm. Technically,
you didn't exactly save her.

10:32.718 --> 10:34.081
Come here, Fiona.

10:34.126 --> 10:35.487
Come here, baby.

10:35.533 --> 10:37.802
Oh, yeah, that's a good girl.

10:37.848 --> 10:40.527
There you go.

10:46.610 --> 10:48.425
Well, how come
she gets to go in?

10:48.471 --> 10:51.740
Well, you know,
all dogs go to Heaven.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.647
Let me just make a call.

10:53.693 --> 10:55.962
There has to be
something wrong.

10:56.007 --> 10:57.505
I've gone to church
since I was three.

10:57.551 --> 11:00.501
I started a program for
at-risk dancers when I was 11.

11:00.547 --> 11:04.678
-Wow. -I... I didn't even
kiss a boy until I was 16.

11:04.723 --> 11:07.539
Well, 15,
but, you know, still.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.263
I... I volunteer
every Christmas

11:09.309 --> 11:11.306
at the homeless shelter,
I... I don't smoke,

11:11.352 --> 11:14.440
I do occasionally enjoy
a nice Pinot, but who doesn't?

11:14.484 --> 11:16.164
Sounds like you've done
some really great stuff.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.435
Just hang on one sec...

11:17.481 --> 11:19.251
Besides, I'm ready.

11:19.296 --> 11:20.931
My whole family
is up here.

11:20.977 --> 11:23.836
My parents died in a freak
accident when I was 20,

11:23.882 --> 11:25.788
so that works out.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.058
My friends will be sad,
but they'll get over it.

11:28.103 --> 11:30.464
I have no boyfriend, no kids.

11:30.510 --> 11:32.280
You know, when I think about
it, I don't really have

11:32.325 --> 11:35.095
any reason to stay on earth.

11:38.681 --> 11:41.087
Okay, I am so sorry,

11:41.133 --> 11:44.083
but you do have
to be on the list.

11:44.129 --> 11:45.673
Well, then Heaven
made a mistake.

11:45.718 --> 11:48.396
Sweetie,
Heaven doesn't make mistakes.

11:48.441 --> 11:50.666
But here's the good news:

11:50.712 --> 11:54.525
it's possible that I can still get
you on the reservations list.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.928
Loving ya, Daphne.

11:59.973 --> 12:01.697
All right, so,
what do you have to do to?

12:01.743 --> 12:03.876
Well, it's not exactly
up to me.

12:03.922 --> 12:05.375
I'm not following.

12:05.421 --> 12:07.646
Okay, in order
to get into Heaven,

12:07.690 --> 12:10.551
you're going to have to go
back to Earth and figure out

12:10.596 --> 12:12.457
what you still need to do
to get on the list.

12:12.502 --> 12:14.319
But I've done
everything right.

12:14.365 --> 12:16.135
Yeah, I don't know what else
there could possibly be.

12:16.180 --> 12:17.905
I'm sorry.

12:17.950 --> 12:19.675
Our policy doesn't allow me
to help you with that.

12:19.721 --> 12:21.718
-But...
-But,

12:21.764 --> 12:24.578
I am sending you back to
somebody who might be able to.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.122
Wait,
I'm not gonna come back

12:26.168 --> 12:28.483
as like a zombie,
or something, right?

12:28.529 --> 12:32.114
No, no, you're in
the spirit world now.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.790
Just think of it like,
an angel in training, okay?

12:36.836 --> 12:39.197
Here, take this.

12:39.243 --> 12:42.148
Just use the Heaven app when
you're ready to be picked up,

12:42.192 --> 12:44.417
and then we can check
to see if you made the list.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.780
You have an app?

12:45.825 --> 12:48.503
Yeah, Steve never stops working.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.315
But what if I don't figure out
what I'm supposed to do,

12:53.361 --> 12:54.995
to get into Heaven?

12:55.041 --> 12:57.583
Well, you're gonna have
to stay here.

12:57.628 --> 12:59.581
And, if you don't
get on the list,

12:59.625 --> 13:03.983
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to wait in there.

13:06.436 --> 13:08.115
<i>Forever.</i>

13:14.607 --> 13:16.423
So, I go back to Earth,

13:16.469 --> 13:19.283
and how long
do I have to save myself

13:19.329 --> 13:22.098
from spending eternity
on that sad little bench?

13:22.142 --> 13:25.774
Management can only give
you until Christmas Eve.

13:25.820 --> 13:28.725
-But that's in a week.
-Eh, 12 days, actually.

13:28.771 --> 13:30.859
But, it's a busy time
of year now.

13:30.904 --> 13:32.539
-Hurry.
-But, I...

13:32.585 --> 13:34.219
Good luck!

13:35.672 --> 13:38.260
Oh, she's gonna need it.

13:40.302 --> 13:44.660
You're just a tall drink of holy
water, aren't ya?

15:03.743 --> 15:05.151
Jordan Ricks?

15:24.808 --> 15:26.896
Sarah?

15:26.942 --> 15:31.164
-How... How did you...
-It's a long story.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.297
I went to your funeral.

15:33.343 --> 15:36.021
Aw, you did?
That's so sweet.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.655
What are you doing here?

15:37.701 --> 15:39.880
How did you get in?
I could have killed you.

15:39.926 --> 15:42.195
Too late for that.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.647
Look, I'm really sorry.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.236
I had no idea they were
sending me back to you.

15:46.282 --> 15:49.141
They who?
Back from where?

15:49.187 --> 15:51.547
You might want to sit down.

15:51.592 --> 15:54.589
And maybe put some pants on.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.492
...And then Daphne the angel made
the lights glow into little music

15:59.538 --> 16:01.398
and Heaven stuff and then I
thought it was really cool

16:01.444 --> 16:03.896
until I realized
I'm not on the stupid list.

16:03.941 --> 16:07.073
...I only have till Christmas Eve to figure
out what I have to do to get on the list,

16:07.119 --> 16:08.753
or I have to sit in this
horrible place

16:08.798 --> 16:11.250
with these miserable people
forever in the dark by myself.

16:11.295 --> 16:14.973
And then she said she was going to send me back
to someone who could help me get into Heaven,

16:15.018 --> 16:17.515
but I thought it would have been,
like, Father Tim from the church,

16:17.560 --> 16:19.830
but then I ended up here, and
you came out with a bat,

16:19.876 --> 16:22.554
and, well,
that's what happened.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.138
Okay.

16:28.184 --> 16:30.680
Well, it was really nice
to see you again,

16:30.726 --> 16:33.404
but I think it's time
for you to go back to

16:33.450 --> 16:35.991
wherever ghosts go when
they're not haunting people.

16:36.037 --> 16:39.442
And maybe just talk
about this tomorrow.

16:39.488 --> 16:41.349
Or, never.

16:41.394 --> 16:44.708
You know, I don't think
you're hearing me.

16:45.979 --> 16:48.022
Ooh.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.884
That was cool.

16:49.929 --> 16:52.380
Okay, that's it,
you've got to go now.

16:52.425 --> 16:54.151
I can't go until
I figure this out.

16:54.197 --> 16:55.423
And, technically,
I'm not a ghost,

16:55.468 --> 16:57.284
I'm an angel.

16:57.329 --> 16:59.372
Well, almost an angel.

17:02.868 --> 17:04.138
<i>This is not happening.</i>

17:04.185 --> 17:05.590
<i>This is not happening,
Jordan.</i>

17:09.813 --> 17:12.763
"May cause confusion
and disorientation."

17:12.810 --> 17:15.761
Yeah, you're just reacting
to your new medication.

17:15.806 --> 17:17.348
You're okay, Jordan.

17:17.394 --> 17:18.893
Everything's fine.

17:30.605 --> 17:32.012
I really wish
you'd just listen to me

17:32.058 --> 17:33.511
and try and not freak out.

17:33.557 --> 17:35.463
Okay,
I am seriously hallucinating.

17:35.508 --> 17:36.826
See, this is exactly why

17:36.871 --> 17:38.368
we broke up
in the first place.

17:38.414 --> 17:40.684
There's always
some kind of drama with you.

17:40.729 --> 17:44.543
Hey, you know, I'm just going to go to bed,
and when I wake up, you'll be be gone.

17:44.587 --> 17:47.357
Fine,
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.624
Do you mind
if I do some cleaning?

17:51.670 --> 17:54.529
It kind of helps me relax,
and well, not to be rude,

17:54.575 --> 17:56.483
but your place
could kind of use it.

17:56.528 --> 17:59.069
Please just go away!

17:59.115 --> 18:01.931
Okay, okay.
Sleep tight.

19:10.209 --> 19:12.570
<i>Yo, Riggles.</i>

19:15.701 --> 19:19.470
<i>It's me, open up.</i>

19:19.514 --> 19:20.877
-Dude.
-Hey.

19:20.923 --> 19:23.192
You were hysterical
last night.

19:23.238 --> 19:26.097
Those hipster douchebags, they
totally had it coming though.

19:26.143 --> 19:27.187
Hey, Stu.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.458
Remind me never to ask you

19:28.504 --> 19:30.319
if the mezcal is organic

19:30.365 --> 19:32.498
and request you serve
it to me in a mason jar,

19:32.544 --> 19:35.541
with an edible flower garnish.

19:35.586 --> 19:38.036
Whoa. What, did you have
a late night O.C.D. attack,

19:38.082 --> 19:40.943
-or something?
-Yeah, something like that.

19:40.988 --> 19:43.213
Hey, what were we drinking
last night after work?

19:43.259 --> 19:46.254
-Manhattans. -Remind me to
lay off the Manhattans.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.479
Dude, what happened to you
last night?

19:48.525 --> 19:49.977
I've been texting you
all morning.

19:50.021 --> 19:51.248
I thought those chicks
from the bar

19:51.293 --> 19:53.019
kidnapped you or something.

19:53.065 --> 19:55.152
Tell me you don't still work
at that late dive bar?

19:58.149 --> 20:00.781
Relax,
I was just kidding, man.

20:00.827 --> 20:02.370
She's back.

20:02.416 --> 20:03.460
<i>What?</i>

20:03.505 --> 20:04.595
Her.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.091
It's Sarah.

20:08.137 --> 20:10.360
Hi, Stuart.
Nice to see you again.

20:11.768 --> 20:14.129
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I read about this.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.582
Okay, all right.

20:15.626 --> 20:18.079
You're just in shock
right now, okay?

20:18.124 --> 20:19.349
But that's normal.

20:19.395 --> 20:20.666
We just went to the funeral.

20:20.711 --> 20:22.527
You can't see her?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.930
I'm here for you, buddy.
Okay?

20:26.976 --> 20:29.065
Come here,
give me a hug.

20:29.109 --> 20:32.605
I told you,
no one else can see me.

20:32.651 --> 20:34.648
<i>Okay, okay, all right.</i>

20:34.693 --> 20:36.192
Uh... You gotta go.
You gotta go, all right?

20:36.238 --> 20:38.826
Look, denial is step two
in the process.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.641
Or is it step three?
I can't remember.

20:40.686 --> 20:42.957
But the point of it is,

20:43.002 --> 20:45.544
is that you really have to
come to terms with who you are.

20:45.588 --> 20:47.133
-Okay, Jordan?
-Bye, Stuart.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.994
-I'll call you later. -C-Can
I have my coat, please?

20:49.039 --> 20:50.128
I need my coat.

20:51.945 --> 20:53.806
Jordan, we need to talk.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.259
No, we don't.

20:56.303 --> 20:57.393
Stop talking to yourself.

20:57.437 --> 20:59.798
You're not talking
to yourself.

21:01.706 --> 21:03.113
Air.

21:03.158 --> 21:05.701
That's what I need, fresh air.
Yeah.

21:05.746 --> 21:08.244
Jordan, wait.
Jordan.

21:08.288 --> 21:09.604
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

21:09.650 --> 21:11.012
I forgot,

21:11.057 --> 21:12.420
you're the only person
in this city

21:12.465 --> 21:13.691
who doesn't believe
in jaywalking.

21:13.736 --> 21:15.052
It's illegal.

21:15.098 --> 21:16.505
It's one of those weird,
charming things

21:16.551 --> 21:17.912
I liked about you.

21:17.958 --> 21:19.320
You remember that time
we were late

21:19.364 --> 21:21.499
to our reservation
at Ox because...

21:21.544 --> 21:23.814
Yeah, because you had to show that place?
And I told you not to.

21:23.860 --> 21:26.720
And I was just about to cross the
street and tell you to meet me there

21:26.766 --> 21:28.672
when that bus
came around the corner,

21:28.718 --> 21:30.351
-<i> And almost...</i>
-Killed you.

21:30.397 --> 21:33.122
You spent the rest
of the night mad at me.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.393
I saved your life.

21:34.437 --> 21:37.025
What is it with me
and buses?

21:37.070 --> 21:39.250
What is this, the longest
light in Portland?

21:39.295 --> 21:40.475
Okay, my bad.

21:40.521 --> 21:42.245
Memory lane trip over.

21:42.291 --> 21:43.335
We really need
to figure out

21:43.380 --> 21:44.516
how I'm going to...

21:44.561 --> 21:46.150
Stu was right.

21:46.196 --> 21:47.557
I've finally done it.

21:47.602 --> 21:49.101
Done what?

21:52.915 --> 21:54.458
Given myself
a nervous breakdown.

21:58.634 --> 22:01.177
Jordan, stop. Jordan.

22:01.222 --> 22:03.084
You are not having
a nervous breakdown.

22:03.128 --> 22:04.854
You are perfectly normal.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.307
I'm the one fighting

22:06.352 --> 22:08.304
for the salvation
of my soul, here.

22:08.350 --> 22:10.029
I know this
is hard to believe,

22:10.075 --> 22:11.392
but this is real.

22:11.438 --> 22:14.887
I'm real, and I need to help.

22:14.931 --> 22:16.748
Heaven sent me back
to you for a reason,

22:16.794 --> 22:18.564
and I need to figure out why.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.880
The sooner I can figure out
how to get on that list,

22:20.925 --> 22:22.468
the sooner you'll get me
out of your life.

22:22.514 --> 22:23.921
This is insane.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.464
You're an angel.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.371
I'm talking to an angel,

22:27.417 --> 22:28.825
in the middle
of the street.

22:30.868 --> 22:32.184
Hey.

22:32.228 --> 22:34.181
Jordan, please.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.679
Help me.

22:37.767 --> 22:40.764
Okay, I'll help you.

22:42.443 --> 22:44.349
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

22:44.395 --> 22:45.712
Thank you.

22:47.755 --> 22:49.026
Hey, buddy,

22:51.114 --> 22:52.885
go be crazy
somewhere else.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.610
You're freaking out
my customers.

22:58.605 --> 23:02.055
-Jordan.
-Amanda.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.915
You came.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.639
I did?

23:07.685 --> 23:11.271
I texted you I was
getting the tree this morning,

23:11.317 --> 23:12.951
but I mean, I didn't
expect you to turn up.

23:12.996 --> 23:15.810
That's so sweet.

23:25.707 --> 23:27.751
You're dating
Amanda Simmons?

23:27.795 --> 23:30.384
I don't think you said that
with enough judgment.

23:30.429 --> 23:34.243
Amanda Simmons
who runs CTEC software?

23:34.288 --> 23:36.103
Why is that so hard
to believe?

23:36.149 --> 23:37.693
I don't know.

23:37.737 --> 23:40.553
You just don't really
seem like her type.

23:40.599 --> 23:42.414
Hardworking?

23:42.459 --> 23:44.274
Entrepreneurial?

23:44.320 --> 23:45.455
Good-looking?

23:45.501 --> 23:49.586
-Bartender?
-Ah, I see.

23:49.632 --> 23:50.857
You're just jealous.

23:50.903 --> 23:53.944
What? No.

23:53.990 --> 23:56.305
That's crazy.

23:56.351 --> 24:00.709
Yeah, you can't handle the fact that I'm
seeing someone more successful than you are.

24:00.755 --> 24:02.026
Were.

24:02.071 --> 24:03.978
-Doesn't she have a kid?
-Yes

24:04.023 --> 24:05.975
And you're totally
okay with that?

24:06.021 --> 24:08.745
Because I distinctly remember you
saying you never wanted to have kids.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.515
Okay, what's with
the interrogation?

24:10.561 --> 24:12.240
I thought you were supposed
to be finding out how

24:12.286 --> 24:16.145
to get out of my life
and get back... upstairs.

24:16.190 --> 24:18.959
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

24:19.004 --> 24:21.319
It's totally inappropriate.

24:28.765 --> 24:29.855
Here.

24:29.899 --> 24:31.898
Try this.

24:33.623 --> 24:35.802
You still take your coffee
like a sorority girl?

24:35.847 --> 24:37.572
Ha. Ha.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.747
Wow. This is really good.
So, what's the plan?

24:43.793 --> 24:45.562
You've seen those movies
where the angel has to help

24:45.608 --> 24:48.287
some lost soul find
their way again, right?

24:48.333 --> 24:51.555
Well, we just have to
figure out how I can help you.

24:51.601 --> 24:53.643
So, your plan is to follow

24:53.689 --> 24:55.778
the plot
of "Angels in the Outfield?"

24:55.822 --> 24:57.049
Well, what other reason

24:57.094 --> 24:58.727
would I have been
sent back to you?

24:58.773 --> 25:01.044
All right, fine.

25:01.088 --> 25:03.721
Whatever, let's just hurry up
with it, okay?

25:03.767 --> 25:05.446
Maybe it's a self-esteem issue?

25:05.492 --> 25:09.805
Or just take care of that
weird chest hair situation?

25:09.850 --> 25:11.620
-Chest hairs?
-I'm assuming you've let go

25:11.666 --> 25:13.119
of the whole actor thing.

25:13.165 --> 25:15.571
I was trying something new.

25:15.616 --> 25:17.295
Well, obviously
you've hit rock bottom,

25:17.341 --> 25:18.612
or else I wouldn't be here.

25:18.658 --> 25:20.246
No, I haven't.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.653
I need to use the
little boys room immediately.

25:22.697 --> 25:24.832
Oh, my god,
oh, my god.

25:24.876 --> 25:26.421
Okay, so my life's
a little bit messy.

25:26.467 --> 25:28.509
But come on, who's isn't?

25:28.554 --> 25:30.825
Yes, but,
I was sent back to you.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.731
You know, why would Daphne
send me back to you

25:32.777 --> 25:34.728
if you didn't need
my help somehow?

25:34.774 --> 25:38.179
So, think. You know, what part of
your life needs the most fixing?

25:38.224 --> 25:40.403
This might be hard for
you to believe,

25:40.449 --> 25:42.945
but, my life's been good
since you left.

25:42.991 --> 25:44.762
Come on,
there has to be something.

25:44.807 --> 25:47.168
A horrible childhood?
Dad didn't play catch with you?

25:47.213 --> 25:48.665
A great childhood.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.300
I just went to a game
with my dad.

25:50.345 --> 25:52.025
What's one dream
you want to come true?

25:52.071 --> 25:54.250
Or, something about your life
you wish you could change?

25:54.294 --> 25:55.566
Besides from getting rid
of the ghost

25:55.611 --> 25:57.063
of my ex-girlfriend?

25:57.109 --> 25:58.562
-Angel.
-Whatever.

25:58.608 --> 25:59.788
Think.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.330
<i>Yo, J-Dog.</i>

26:02.376 --> 26:03.874
<i>I got us a meeting
with that pub owner</i>

26:03.918 --> 26:05.553
<i>down at River Point.</i>

26:05.599 --> 26:06.869
<i>But I promised him</i>

26:06.915 --> 26:08.868
<i>half a dozen
maple bacon donuts</i>

26:08.913 --> 26:12.317
<i>and he said
he'll give us five minutes.</i>

26:12.363 --> 26:15.903
<i>These old boats,
they always got a price.</i>

26:15.949 --> 26:17.947
-<i> Am I right?</i>
-Hello?

26:17.992 --> 26:19.673
Real Estate is my jam.

26:19.717 --> 26:21.624
Please don't say that.

26:21.670 --> 26:25.347
And it's just a stupid dream,
I'm not gonna buy anything.

26:25.392 --> 26:27.300
Why didn't I think
of this before?

26:27.344 --> 26:28.706
Jordan, that's it!

26:28.752 --> 26:30.795
That's why I've been
sent back to you.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.338
Let me help make
your dream come true.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.881
I'm gonna help you get
your pub for Christmas.

26:37.558 --> 26:39.874
I got a freaking bladder
like a 90-year-old.

26:45.549 --> 26:48.909
Come on, man.
Do I gotta worry about you?

26:48.953 --> 26:53.176
Oh, no, man. I'm... I'm just
trying some new stretches.

26:55.536 --> 27:00.122
Oh. Did I tell you about that new
cardio barre class I started taking?

27:00.168 --> 27:02.709
I gotta take you,
you'd love it.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.117
Yeah.

27:06.568 --> 27:09.882
You gotta try to balance
and keep the chi.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.426
Keep the chi.

27:20.688 --> 27:25.998
So... you know,
it would need some work.

27:27.407 --> 27:29.267
God, it really smells
like fish down here.

27:29.313 --> 27:31.038
That's what I love about it.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.535
It's right next to the river.

27:32.581 --> 27:34.715
It gives you that
working-class feel.

27:34.760 --> 27:35.850
I was thinking
of calling it,

27:35.896 --> 27:36.939
The Dock House.

27:36.985 --> 27:38.391
What do you think?

27:38.437 --> 27:39.844
I think I should have
brought mace.

27:41.070 --> 27:43.568
Come on, it's not that bad.

27:43.613 --> 27:45.610
There's not a single
prostitute in sight.

27:45.656 --> 27:47.971
Okay, I think you need to set
the bar a little higher.

27:48.017 --> 27:49.786
I mean, this is supposed
to be your dream place,

27:49.832 --> 27:51.739
But it is.

27:51.784 --> 27:54.690
My grandfather used to take
me here when I was a kid.

27:54.735 --> 27:56.733
We'd sit here and watch boats
go up the river

27:56.779 --> 27:58.958
and get ready to go fishing.

28:01.771 --> 28:04.088
What can I say?
I guess I'm a sentimental guy.

28:05.495 --> 28:07.628
This place
has been here forever.

28:07.674 --> 28:09.126
It just needs
the love and care

28:09.172 --> 28:10.851
that it deserves.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.986
Well, I guess
every neighborhood

28:13.031 --> 28:14.892
needs its pioneers.

28:14.937 --> 28:16.481
I mean, the Pearl District
was all pawn shops

28:16.526 --> 28:18.570
and meth labs
till the gays moved in.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.294
We just need to
get your pitch down.

28:20.340 --> 28:23.154
-No, don't waste your time.
-Huh?

28:23.199 --> 28:25.969
Well, you heard what Stu said,
The guy doesn't want to sell.

28:26.015 --> 28:27.376
And why would he
to someone like me?

28:27.421 --> 28:28.920
I can't even offer
that much money.

28:28.966 --> 28:30.555
Hello?
Where's your Christmas spirit?

28:30.600 --> 28:32.097
The only reason
he's meeting with us

28:32.143 --> 28:34.821
is because we're bribing him
with donuts.

28:34.867 --> 28:37.273
He's an old-school dude
who's stuck in his ways.

28:37.318 --> 28:38.816
It's not gonna work.

28:38.862 --> 28:40.451
Okay, that's ridiculous.

28:40.496 --> 28:41.949
I mean, this guy
should be paying you

28:41.994 --> 28:44.719
to take it off his hands.

28:44.765 --> 28:46.261
Are you sure there aren't
any other bars

28:46.307 --> 28:49.939
in any other parts of
the city that you like?

28:49.985 --> 28:52.572
I don't know. Maybe.

28:52.617 --> 28:56.113
But if we're talking
about my dream?

28:56.159 --> 28:58.202
This is it.

29:00.108 --> 29:02.197
Okay, well, we don't
have a lot of time.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.967
Time... Shoot, Mason!

29:04.013 --> 29:05.965
Where're you going?

29:06.010 --> 29:09.279
Oh, I promised Amanda that I'd
pick up her son at practice today.

29:09.323 --> 29:12.003
But we have to figure
out how to get this guy to sell.

29:12.048 --> 29:14.182
You can perform
miracles, right?

29:14.227 --> 29:16.180
You better start
flapping your angel wings.

29:16.224 --> 29:18.313
They don't even have wings.

29:20.129 --> 29:23.897
Come on, Steve,
no one can do that math.

29:46.687 --> 29:47.685
Sorry I'm late.

29:47.731 --> 29:49.002
It's okay.

29:49.048 --> 29:52.089
Angus Miller only beat me up
twice this time.

29:52.135 --> 29:54.222
Oh, my God, Mason,
all you all right?

29:54.268 --> 29:56.266
I'm just kidding.

29:56.311 --> 29:58.581
Mostly.

29:58.626 --> 29:59.943
Why'd you say that?

29:59.988 --> 30:02.212
I don't know.
To make you feel guilty.

30:03.529 --> 30:07.251
Well, that's just... mean.

30:07.297 --> 30:10.657
So, you don't feel guilty
that you forgot about me?

30:10.702 --> 30:13.107
Yes, I do.

30:13.153 --> 30:15.422
No, no,
I didn't forget about you,

30:15.468 --> 30:16.694
it's just...

30:19.055 --> 30:20.372
How was practice?

30:20.417 --> 30:22.097
It was fine.

30:22.141 --> 30:24.139
Are you coming over tonight?

30:24.185 --> 30:25.366
Tonight?

30:25.410 --> 30:27.091
To decorate the tree.

30:27.136 --> 30:29.496
Or did you forget
about that, too?

30:29.542 --> 30:31.359
-No.
-It's okay.

30:31.403 --> 30:32.584
You've probably got
a lot of stuff

30:32.630 --> 30:33.945
on your plate right now.

30:33.990 --> 30:36.625
You have no idea.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.940
Well, you seem
a little distracted.

30:38.985 --> 30:40.029
Yeah.

30:40.075 --> 30:42.299
Well, I guess I kind of am.

30:42.344 --> 30:44.251
I mean,
the bar has been crazy

30:44.296 --> 30:48.882
because of the holidays,
and on top of all that,

30:48.927 --> 30:50.697
I had an old friend
show up out of the blue.

30:50.743 --> 30:52.831
What old friend?

30:52.876 --> 30:56.962
Just someone
that I used to know.

30:57.007 --> 30:58.278
A girl?

30:58.324 --> 31:00.958
No.

31:01.003 --> 31:04.997
-Yeah, but it's not the way you think
it is. -Then what am I thinking?

31:05.043 --> 31:08.040
-That it's something that it's not.
-Nope.

31:08.084 --> 31:10.537
-What are you thinking? -I'm thinking
that it doesn't really matter.

31:10.582 --> 31:11.854
You're not my dad,

31:11.898 --> 31:13.260
so you can do
whatever you want.

31:18.889 --> 31:20.388
Mason,

31:23.156 --> 31:24.701
It's just...

31:24.746 --> 31:26.198
my mom's kind of
a Christmas freak,

31:26.243 --> 31:28.378
so, if you're gonna
break up with her,

31:28.422 --> 31:30.465
can you do it after?

31:30.511 --> 31:31.828
I'm not gonna break up
with her.

31:31.873 --> 31:33.780
I'm totally into her.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.778
And I wouldn't do it
on Christmas. Never.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.729
Okay.

31:41.361 --> 31:44.267
I'm sorry I can't come over
tonight, I've gotta work.

31:46.082 --> 31:47.809
But, as soon as
I get off work

31:47.853 --> 31:49.215
on Christmas Eve,
we're gonna hang out,

31:49.261 --> 31:50.714
all right?

31:50.758 --> 31:52.620
I... I've got church
on Christmas Eve.

31:52.665 --> 31:54.527
I'm doing a solo.

31:54.571 --> 31:56.388
Oh, a guitar solo?

31:56.434 --> 31:58.159
No, like, singing.

31:58.204 --> 32:00.656
I know, it's really lame
but my mom likes it.

32:00.702 --> 32:01.927
It's not lame.

32:01.973 --> 32:03.379
Girls love a guy
who can sing.

32:03.425 --> 32:07.011
Guys who can sing
"Oh Holy Night?"

32:07.057 --> 32:08.373
Well, at least
your mom loves it.

32:09.689 --> 32:11.096
She's the one
who matters most, right?

32:13.094 --> 32:14.229
I guess.

32:14.275 --> 32:15.910
Hey, how about
I come to church?

32:15.955 --> 32:17.679
I promise
I won't laugh at you.

32:22.764 --> 32:23.989
Let's go.

33:00.399 --> 33:02.305
-Surprise!
-Oh!

33:02.351 --> 33:04.440
-Sorry.
-You've gotta stop doing that.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.937
Nice tree, huh?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.435
Yeah.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.796
How did you do that?

33:09.842 --> 33:12.157
I've been working
on my angel skills.

33:12.203 --> 33:14.472
So much fun.

33:14.518 --> 33:15.699
And look,

33:15.743 --> 33:17.605
spiced angel cider.

33:26.503 --> 33:28.182
Not bad, right?

33:28.228 --> 33:30.997
Not bad at all.
Wait, what's going on?

33:31.043 --> 33:33.358
We're pre-celebrating.

33:33.404 --> 33:36.899
What? It's good to visualize
the outcome you want,

33:36.944 --> 33:38.897
and not worry about the things
you can't control.

33:38.943 --> 33:40.439
You are always
the optimistic one.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.392
You're gonna kill it tomorrow.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.935
Sarah, give me one good reason

33:43.981 --> 33:46.614
why this guy would sell
the bar to someone like me?

33:46.659 --> 33:48.158
You always did that.

33:48.203 --> 33:49.383
What?

33:49.429 --> 33:51.608
Doubted yourself.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.651
I'm just not very
good on paper.

33:53.696 --> 33:56.012
Well, don't worry.
I'll be with you tomorrow.

33:56.057 --> 33:57.238
You're not gonna
do any of that

33:57.283 --> 33:58.735
weird ghost stuff, are you?

33:58.780 --> 34:01.686
Hello? I don't need
any heavenly help.

34:01.732 --> 34:03.502
I'm the real estate
queen of Portland.

34:05.908 --> 34:10.221
To Sarah, the late, great, real
estate queen of Portland.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.257
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.931
No, it's okay, I just...

34:22.976 --> 34:24.522
It's a nice gesture.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.199
I just haven't had a moment
to process it.

34:29.788 --> 34:31.059
What's it like?

34:32.331 --> 34:33.465
Being dead?

34:37.733 --> 34:43.496
I don't really know, I haven't
had a chance to think about it.

34:43.543 --> 34:45.449
Well, you can see
what other people think.

34:46.630 --> 34:48.446
What? Oh, my God,

34:48.492 --> 34:49.763
I didn't even think
about that.

34:49.808 --> 34:51.170
I mean, I thought about it,
but...

34:51.215 --> 34:53.257
Hey, what's your password?

34:53.303 --> 34:55.618
Well, just go to my page.

34:55.664 --> 34:57.843
Yeah, you unfriended me,
remember?

34:57.889 --> 34:59.932
I can't see it.

34:59.976 --> 35:01.293
Here.

35:04.199 --> 35:07.831
Oh, come on, you're afraid I'm gonna
steal your password in the afterlife?

35:07.876 --> 35:09.148
There.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.278
Okay.
Here's one from Anna P.

35:13.324 --> 35:14.732
"This is so sad.

35:14.777 --> 35:16.093
One minute you're hanging out

35:16.138 --> 35:17.818
with your co-workers
for drinks,

35:17.864 --> 35:19.680
and the next thing you know
you're hit by a bus.

35:19.725 --> 35:22.222
Total perspective.
I'm gonna hug my man tonight.

35:22.268 --> 35:23.674
Miss you girl."

35:23.720 --> 35:25.218
See, that's not bad, right?

35:25.263 --> 35:27.170
I have no idea who it is.

35:29.758 --> 35:31.075
Okay.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.481
Well, here's some more.

35:32.527 --> 35:34.116
"Unbelievably huge loss.

35:34.162 --> 35:36.069
escrow will never
be the same."

35:36.113 --> 35:37.522
Hey, you left
a real estate legacy.

35:37.566 --> 35:40.245
That's gotta be kind
of nice to hear, right?

35:40.290 --> 35:42.197
Yeah.

35:42.242 --> 35:43.422
I guess.

35:43.468 --> 35:45.601
Oh... Oh, here's a good one.

35:45.647 --> 35:47.826
"O.M.G.
I can't believe she's gone.

35:47.872 --> 35:50.005
She has the cutest outfits.

35:50.051 --> 35:53.546
"Hey girl! I'm so toasting with
those huge margaritas tonight.

35:53.592 --> 35:56.996
Miss you totes."
Ha. This is fantastic.

35:57.042 --> 35:58.314
You don't have to keep
reading those.

35:58.359 --> 35:59.947
Well, here's another one.

35:59.993 --> 36:02.172
"Sarah totally changed
my world of you guys.

36:02.218 --> 36:04.851
"She took me out
of that strange little life... "

36:04.897 --> 36:06.349
And wait for it...

36:06.394 --> 36:07.802
"Into my sick new condo,
y'all.

36:07.847 --> 36:09.617
She was the best.
Love you... "

36:09.663 --> 36:11.206
Jordan, stop!

36:13.477 --> 36:15.474
I don't want to hear anymore.

36:21.104 --> 36:22.510
You knew a lot of people.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.914
Yeah. Well, apparently,
all anybody knew about me

36:26.959 --> 36:30.002
was my job and my clothes.

36:35.902 --> 36:40.397
Sarah, I don't know how to say this
without sounding judgmental, but...

36:40.442 --> 36:41.850
But, what?

36:43.938 --> 36:47.887
Sometimes, you might seem
a little self-centered.

36:47.933 --> 36:50.974
And surface-y.

36:51.020 --> 36:52.745
That doesn't make any sense.

36:52.791 --> 36:54.880
I'm always helping people,

36:54.924 --> 36:56.650
listening to
everyone's problems.

36:56.695 --> 36:58.193
You broke up with me
on Christmas Eve.

37:00.554 --> 37:03.732
Yeah. It was kind of brutal.

37:07.454 --> 37:09.315
But it wasn't working
between us.

37:10.859 --> 37:12.494
We were miserable,
I mean, you remember.

37:12.539 --> 37:13.584
Right?

37:13.628 --> 37:15.080
Yeah, I remember.

37:15.126 --> 37:16.852
So, what was I supposed to do,

37:16.897 --> 37:19.121
just pretend everything
was okay, when it wasn't?

37:19.167 --> 37:21.119
Actually, yeah.

37:21.165 --> 37:23.525
It was Christmas.

37:23.570 --> 37:24.978
The greatest gift
you could have given me

37:25.024 --> 37:27.157
was pretending
one more day.

37:28.656 --> 37:30.835
You broke my heart, Sarah.

37:33.104 --> 37:34.784
I haven't been doing
very well since you left.

37:34.829 --> 37:37.372
I'm sure you've seen
my medicine cabinet.

37:37.417 --> 37:38.598
That's not fair.

37:39.778 --> 37:41.866
Yeah, you're right.

37:41.912 --> 37:45.725
I'm sorry, I just...

37:45.770 --> 37:47.087
I know that
there's more to you

37:47.132 --> 37:49.810
besides charity,
and condos, and shoes.

37:49.856 --> 37:51.173
But maybe
that's the only thing

37:51.217 --> 37:52.398
you let people see.

37:57.755 --> 37:59.798
I should get to bed.

37:59.843 --> 38:02.022
We've got a big day
tomorrow, all right?

38:03.339 --> 38:04.793
Good-night.

38:25.675 --> 38:27.218
I don't like your face.

38:28.763 --> 38:30.169
It reminds me
of that actor.

38:30.215 --> 38:32.166
You know, that movie
where those guys

38:32.212 --> 38:35.300
go to Las Vegas, get drunk,
and lose their friend?

38:35.345 --> 38:36.524
"The Hangover."

38:36.570 --> 38:38.931
Right. Hated that movie.

38:40.429 --> 38:42.336
Well, you're probably
the only one.

38:42.381 --> 38:44.469
What are you doing?

38:44.515 --> 38:46.285
Who doesn't like
"The Hangover."

38:46.330 --> 38:48.329
Let it go.
Stay focused.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.957
Sir, I really think
that you'll be happy

38:54.003 --> 38:55.592
with the changes
that I wanna make.

38:55.638 --> 38:57.045
I'd like to gut the kitchen

38:57.091 --> 38:59.905
and put in
a big wood-burning oven.

38:59.950 --> 39:02.129
And then I would pull
the wallpaper,

39:02.175 --> 39:04.354
and leave
all the exposed brick.

39:04.399 --> 39:09.257
So, you'd like to turn this
into a coffee shop?

39:09.301 --> 39:10.300
What? No, no.

39:10.346 --> 39:12.843
It just needs
a little TLC.

39:12.889 --> 39:15.522
You don't think I've taken
good care of her?

39:15.568 --> 39:16.928
No, you've done
a great job,

39:16.974 --> 39:18.654
it's just, there's some things
around here

39:18.700 --> 39:20.197
that could be fixed.

39:20.242 --> 39:22.285
No, there aren't.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.005
Sir, I think we're on
the same page here.

39:28.051 --> 39:31.865
You'd like to put condos
on top of her, right?

39:31.911 --> 39:33.499
No, no, I never said that.

39:39.764 --> 39:41.897
Ask him about Liza.

39:41.943 --> 39:44.530
-What? -Ask him if
this is about Liza.

39:49.298 --> 39:52.747
Sir, this might sound
a little bit crazy, but,

39:52.793 --> 39:55.881
could this have
anything to do with Liza?

39:55.927 --> 39:58.331
She wants him to know
she's okay.

39:58.377 --> 40:00.420
She wants you to know
she's okay.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.009
She doesn't blame him.

40:02.055 --> 40:03.779
She doesn't blame you.

40:03.824 --> 40:05.369
She knows he did the best
he could do,

40:05.414 --> 40:06.957
but it's time to move on.

40:07.003 --> 40:08.955
She knows that you did
your best,

40:09.001 --> 40:10.362
but you need to move on.

40:11.769 --> 40:13.766
It's time.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.264
She wants him to know you'll
take care of their place.

40:16.309 --> 40:18.125
He can trust you.

40:18.170 --> 40:19.805
She trusts me
to take care of the place.

40:19.851 --> 40:24.163
And she thinks
you should, too.

40:24.209 --> 40:25.933
She's got a '43 Merlot,

40:25.979 --> 40:27.160
and a great table
waiting for him

40:27.205 --> 40:28.522
when he gets there.

40:28.567 --> 40:30.155
Liza says
she's got a '43 Merlot

40:30.201 --> 40:31.790
and a great table
waiting for you

40:31.836 --> 40:33.288
whenever you're ready.

40:37.148 --> 40:39.008
I'm losing her.

40:43.730 --> 40:45.363
What just happened?

40:45.409 --> 40:46.499
Was I talking out loud?

40:54.807 --> 40:56.123
You take good care of her.

41:06.110 --> 41:07.609
-Yay!
-Oh.

41:08.789 --> 41:10.968
-Yeah!
-Yeah, buddy.

41:11.014 --> 41:13.965
Here we go, baby.
Here we go.

41:14.010 --> 41:15.735
All right.
To The Dock House.

41:15.780 --> 41:17.551
To The Dock House.

41:17.597 --> 41:19.321
Buddy, this is amazing.

41:19.367 --> 41:21.137
Hey, Stu,
it's gonna be a lot of work.

41:21.182 --> 41:22.318
I hope you're up for it.

41:22.363 --> 41:24.860
Bro, I'm totally here for you,

41:24.906 --> 41:26.494
except on Tuesdays
and Thursdays,

41:26.540 --> 41:27.901
I got urbanating
down at Powells.

41:27.947 --> 41:29.400
They got the hottest
chicks there.

41:29.446 --> 41:31.807
I just can't believe
this is happening.

41:31.851 --> 41:33.577
I have never seen you happier.

41:33.622 --> 41:35.710
Whoa.

41:42.247 --> 41:45.334
Okay, bro,
I gotta be honest with you,

41:45.380 --> 41:47.332
this whole "seeing-your-dead
ex-girlfriend" thing

41:47.377 --> 41:49.240
is really starting
to freak me out.

41:49.284 --> 41:50.600
Stu, I gotta
tell you something,

41:50.646 --> 41:52.235
but you're not
gonna believe it.

41:52.281 --> 41:53.506
No, don't.

41:56.002 --> 41:57.137
What?

41:59.680 --> 42:01.133
I, um...

42:06.717 --> 42:08.306
I'm going vegan.

42:08.351 --> 42:10.258
Yeah, man,
I... I...

42:10.303 --> 42:13.481
I'm taking this cleanse to get rid
of all the toxins out of my body.

42:13.526 --> 42:16.613
And it's totally making me
act all strange.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.699
Buddy, this is amazing!

42:20.745 --> 42:23.923
Come on, why would you think
I wouldn't understand?

42:23.968 --> 42:26.828
I don't know, man, I just know how
much you love pork and whiskey,

42:26.873 --> 42:29.280
and I didn't want you
to think I've totally changed.

42:29.325 --> 42:31.505
No, you'll always be
my little riggles,

42:31.550 --> 42:33.502
no matter what
kind of weird diet you go on.

42:33.548 --> 42:35.317
Thanks, bud,
that means a lot.

42:35.363 --> 42:37.451
All right,

42:37.496 --> 42:39.222
I've gotta go do
some pub research.

42:41.538 --> 42:42.944
Hey, I don't know
if going and drinking

42:42.990 --> 42:46.167
at another pub
counts as "research."

42:46.213 --> 42:47.348
It does to me.

44:12.833 --> 44:15.284
All right, get
your shoulders together.

44:15.328 --> 44:17.009
Squeeze in a little bit.

44:17.055 --> 44:18.870
All right, get our
singing voices ready.

44:21.639 --> 44:23.501
Here we go.

44:23.546 --> 44:25.270
Is everyone ready?

44:41.025 --> 44:42.386
I really don't have time

44:42.432 --> 44:44.429
to play this game
with you, Sarah.

44:44.475 --> 44:46.563
It'll just take a second.

44:46.609 --> 44:48.833
But I think you'll really
like it.

44:50.831 --> 44:51.920
Ta-da.

44:53.100 --> 44:54.780
Wow.

44:54.825 --> 44:57.004
Wait until you see inside.

45:02.497 --> 45:04.132
Merry Christmas.

45:05.221 --> 45:06.810
How did you do this?

45:06.855 --> 45:09.671
This old thing? Eh,
just the standard applicate

45:09.717 --> 45:11.622
I did in crafting class.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.302
You'd be surprised
what you can accomplish

45:13.348 --> 45:14.983
when you focus on a dream.

45:15.027 --> 45:16.661
-Huh?
-I'm not even gonna ask

45:16.707 --> 45:18.342
what kind of drugs
you took to get this place

45:18.387 --> 45:20.293
together this quickly,
but, buddy,

45:20.339 --> 45:21.791
this is incredible.

45:21.837 --> 45:23.471
This is amazing, Sarah.

45:26.331 --> 45:29.191
Hey, so, um...

45:30.735 --> 45:33.050
I drove by the church
the other night,

45:33.096 --> 45:35.502
they set up a really
nice memorial for Sarah.

45:35.547 --> 45:39.134
Maybe you should stop by,
and you know...

45:39.179 --> 45:40.269
have some closure.

45:40.313 --> 45:41.358
Yeah, that sounds nice, Stuey.

45:41.403 --> 45:42.902
Maybe I'll do that.

45:42.947 --> 45:44.945
Jordy, I know this is gonna
sound weird,

45:44.989 --> 45:47.032
but I think Sarah dying
was actually the best thing

45:47.078 --> 45:49.711
-that that could ever happen for you.
-Excuse me?

45:49.757 --> 45:51.981
Now you can finally
give up on the ghost.

45:52.027 --> 45:53.524
-You can see her?
-Huh?

45:53.570 --> 45:55.840
Oh, right. The ghost
of her past. Got it.

45:55.885 --> 45:57.520
Jordy, I'm not saying
I'm happy she's dead,

45:57.565 --> 45:59.199
or anything, but,
you've been holding onto her

45:59.245 --> 46:00.925
for way too long now.

46:00.970 --> 46:02.831
In fact, I never really
understood what you saw in her

46:02.877 --> 46:04.194
in the first place.

46:04.239 --> 46:06.054
Hey, just because
she's not here

46:06.100 --> 46:07.870
doesn't mean you can talk
about her like that, Stu.

46:07.915 --> 46:09.550
Oh, well,
I'm sorry to throw down

46:09.596 --> 46:11.548
some hardcore truth
on you like this tonight,

46:11.593 --> 46:13.681
but, let's be honest.

46:13.727 --> 46:15.044
The girl was kind of
a mental case.

46:16.450 --> 46:18.539
It's time to moveon.org,
buddy.

46:18.583 --> 46:20.310
Yeah, yeah, okay. I think
you should just go home.

46:20.355 --> 46:21.944
She doesn't need to listen
to any more of this.

46:21.989 --> 46:25.212
Dude, this is exactly
what I'm worried about.

46:25.258 --> 46:28.299
She can't hear me.
She's not here.

46:28.345 --> 46:30.524
I mean, you keep letting
this girl ruin your life.

46:30.568 --> 46:32.159
She didn't ruin my life.

46:32.203 --> 46:34.201
She changed it.

46:34.246 --> 46:36.244
In fact, she's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

46:36.289 --> 46:38.332
You just can't see it
because...

46:39.830 --> 46:42.146
Well, you just can't see it.

46:42.191 --> 46:45.369
Jordy, listen to yourself.

46:45.415 --> 46:49.364
This chick dumped you like a misfit
toy a year ago on Christmas Eve.

46:49.410 --> 46:50.863
And you're - You're talking
about her

46:50.907 --> 46:53.586
like she's right here.

46:53.631 --> 46:55.901
You're losing it, man.

46:55.947 --> 46:59.806
Yeah, well, maybe I am.
But I don't even care.

46:59.850 --> 47:02.938
I've never been happier
than I was with her.

47:02.984 --> 47:05.571
She's the reason
we got this pub, not me!

47:08.022 --> 47:11.155
No wonder why
you can't commit to Amanda.

47:11.201 --> 47:12.925
What do you mean?

47:12.971 --> 47:15.240
Here we are again
on Christmas Eve.

47:17.238 --> 47:19.100
Just let Sarah go already.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.308
Sarah?

47:34.353 --> 47:36.760
I'm sorry about Stu.
He's an idiot.

47:36.806 --> 47:39.392
He gets
overprotective sometimes.

47:39.438 --> 47:41.890
Did you really mean
all that back there?

47:41.934 --> 47:43.841
Every word of it.

47:43.887 --> 47:45.657
I changed your life?

47:45.703 --> 47:47.519
Yeah.

47:47.564 --> 47:49.789
Well, then, I think
it's time for me to go.

47:49.834 --> 47:52.921
I mean, you can finally get rid
of your annoying ex-girlfriend.

47:52.967 --> 47:55.463
No, Sarah, I miss
every part about you.

47:55.509 --> 47:58.868
Your smile, your laugh,
your heart.

48:00.911 --> 48:03.999
I think I'm in love with you.

48:04.044 --> 48:07.584
God knows I shouldn't be,
but I can't help it.

48:07.630 --> 48:08.947
I didn't tell you
when you were alive,

48:08.991 --> 48:10.626
but I should have.

48:10.671 --> 48:11.852
Jordan,
you don't have to...

48:11.896 --> 48:13.668
Do we have our differences?

48:13.713 --> 48:15.257
Of course.

48:15.302 --> 48:17.254
Dead and alive
are pretty big differences.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.525
Okay,
so it's kind of strange,

48:18.571 --> 48:20.613
but we can
figure it out.

48:20.659 --> 48:24.746
Jordan, you're very sweet,
but, it's Christmas Eve.

48:24.790 --> 48:27.469
They're expecting me back.

48:27.514 --> 48:28.785
You have to let me go.

48:52.029 --> 48:53.119
Sarah.

49:09.326 --> 49:12.911
You know, you look
really good in lights.

49:12.957 --> 49:15.454
It's your color.
You know what I'm saying?

49:15.500 --> 49:18.450
-Oh! Welcome back.
-I did it. I fixed it.

49:18.496 --> 49:20.085
I made his dream come true.

49:20.131 --> 49:21.855
Yes, you did.

49:21.901 --> 49:24.216
I can't believe it.
Did you see how happy he was?

49:24.262 --> 49:26.168
So, I guess this means
I'm on the list.

49:27.485 --> 49:28.756
Oh.

49:29.937 --> 49:31.479
What?

49:31.525 --> 49:33.568
No, no, no, no.
Check it again.

49:33.613 --> 49:36.292
I'm so sorry, Sarah,
but you're still not on here.

49:36.337 --> 49:37.880
But I did everything right.

49:39.651 --> 49:43.464
Oh, no. The kiss?
It wasn't supposed to happen.

49:43.510 --> 49:44.872
I was just trying to help,
and then...

49:44.917 --> 49:47.096
He fell back in love with you.

49:48.368 --> 49:49.866
And now I broke his heart.

49:49.911 --> 49:51.999
Twice.

49:52.045 --> 49:54.905
It's Christmas Eve,
and I'm not on the list.

49:56.630 --> 49:58.447
Please don't make me
go in there.

49:58.492 --> 49:59.853
Okay, let me make a call.

50:01.215 --> 50:03.349
Excuse me?
- Oh.

50:03.394 --> 50:06.481
Uh, Gerald,
Gerald Johnson.

50:06.527 --> 50:08.298
Yes.
Mr. Johnson.

50:08.342 --> 50:09.931
Yes, your wife's
waiting inside.

50:09.977 --> 50:13.790
We have a lovely spot
for you by the gates.

50:13.836 --> 50:16.287
-Derek will show you to your table.
- Thank you.

50:16.333 --> 50:18.013
You just sold your bar
to my friend.

50:23.507 --> 50:25.276
The guy with the face.

50:28.136 --> 50:30.225
I sold him the bar,

50:30.269 --> 50:32.448
went home, made dinner.

50:32.494 --> 50:37.216
I fed the cat,
laid down on the couch,

50:37.261 --> 50:38.986
I must have had a stroke
in my sleep.

50:40.530 --> 50:42.346
It must be time
for me to go.

50:42.391 --> 50:43.526
Buh-bye.

50:45.750 --> 50:48.339
And I mean, bye-bye.

50:49.700 --> 50:52.561
Yay, good news.

50:52.605 --> 50:54.512
Okay, things are
a little backed up,

50:54.558 --> 50:56.964
so management is giving
you an extension.

50:57.009 --> 50:59.370
Oh, thank God.

50:59.416 --> 51:00.868
Gosh.

51:00.914 --> 51:04.728
But this is it, Sarah.
You have to find a way.

51:04.772 --> 51:06.406
No, I got it.

51:06.452 --> 51:09.222
I'm totally gonna help
Jordan figure this out.

51:09.268 --> 51:12.036
Maybe it's not Jordan
who needs fixing.

51:12.081 --> 51:13.715
Stuart?

51:13.761 --> 51:15.078
But how would I... It would take...

51:16.394 --> 51:18.664
Please let me know
what it is.

51:18.710 --> 51:21.660
Sarah, you've left
something undone.

51:21.705 --> 51:25.156
You can't get into heaven
with unfinished business.

51:25.202 --> 51:30.513
Now, go back, and find out
what your heart truly wants.

51:30.558 --> 51:32.737
Now, go!

51:37.187 --> 51:38.685
Wish me luck.

52:01.021 --> 52:04.334
One spiced angel cider,
please.

52:04.380 --> 52:06.740
Wow, you really got
the word out fast tonight.

52:08.874 --> 52:12.188
Okay, so obviously things
didn't go exactly as planned,

52:12.234 --> 52:15.048
because, you know, I'm back.

52:16.955 --> 52:19.043
Look, we should
talk about what happened.

52:19.088 --> 52:21.178
I'm confused,
and I'm sure you are too.

52:21.222 --> 52:23.764
I mean, what was that kiss?

52:23.810 --> 52:25.399
It was totally sweet.

52:25.445 --> 52:27.033
Well, actually,
it was super romantic.

52:27.078 --> 52:28.759
Like the end
of "Pride and Prejudice"

52:28.805 --> 52:30.711
where Mr. Darcy's
walking across the moor

52:30.756 --> 52:33.207
and he sees Lizzy,
and he takes her in his arms,

52:33.252 --> 52:37.158
and... Anyway,
the bigger issue is,

52:37.202 --> 52:39.654
I need to get into Heaven,
and I kissed you,

52:39.700 --> 52:44.465
and you have a girlfriend,
and... Everything is crazy.

52:44.511 --> 52:46.282
I never meant
for that to happen.

52:46.327 --> 52:48.235
Bro-licious.

52:48.279 --> 52:50.458
Hello, Stuart.
Great timing as usual.

52:50.504 --> 52:52.092
You see those hotties
in the corner?

52:52.138 --> 52:53.909
-Yeah.
-Yup.

52:53.954 --> 52:55.770
I think they would make
an excellent Christmas gift

52:55.816 --> 53:00.809
for your best friend, slash
co-owner, slash, spiritual mentor.

53:00.854 --> 53:03.715
Very funny. Okay, can we please get
back to me, 'cause I'm kind of

53:03.759 --> 53:05.486
in the middle
of something here.

53:05.530 --> 53:07.437
Ladies and gentlemen,

53:07.483 --> 53:10.162
can I have your attention,
please?

53:10.208 --> 53:13.203
I'd like us all
to raise a glass,

53:13.249 --> 53:15.292
to the young proprietor

53:15.336 --> 53:20.966
of this swanky saloon,
this angelical juke joint,

53:21.012 --> 53:24.960
this cantankerous cantina... Ow!

53:25.006 --> 53:26.913
Oh, all right.

53:26.958 --> 53:30.590
To the young man who decided
to follow his heart,

53:30.636 --> 53:32.815
and open up the pub
of his dreams,

53:32.861 --> 53:35.176
not some 12 short months ago.

53:36.220 --> 53:37.763
I salute him,

53:37.809 --> 53:41.713
on his hollowed,
yet very drunken occasion,

53:43.392 --> 53:44.572
to The Dock House.

53:44.618 --> 53:45.708
To The Dock House.

53:45.753 --> 53:48.069
To The Dock House!

53:48.114 --> 53:49.702
Happy Anniversary.

53:49.748 --> 53:51.565
Thanks.

53:51.610 --> 53:53.017
Mm.

53:53.062 --> 53:54.470
Wait, Jordan,
what's he talking about?

53:54.515 --> 53:55.787
I was gone for, like,
five minutes.

53:57.557 --> 53:59.644
Hello? It's me.

53:59.690 --> 54:01.189
Don't waste your time,
honey.

54:01.235 --> 54:04.048
-Been there, done that.
-What?

54:04.094 --> 54:05.593
-But how can you... Trust me.

54:05.637 --> 54:06.953
He's not the committing type.

54:14.399 --> 54:16.261
Amanda?

54:17.849 --> 54:20.755
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

54:20.801 --> 54:22.253
Not her.

54:22.298 --> 54:24.205
Stu!

54:26.112 --> 54:27.882
Is that Amanda Simmons?

54:27.928 --> 54:31.423
My bad. Totally forgot
to update you on that situation.

54:31.469 --> 54:33.013
Dude,
your ex-girlfriend's here.

54:34.647 --> 54:36.553
Are things gonna get weird?

54:38.324 --> 54:41.275
Things are super, super weird.

54:43.772 --> 54:45.405
What?

54:52.579 --> 54:55.257
Oh, hi.

54:55.303 --> 54:56.483
Hi.

54:57.981 --> 54:59.569
Okay, I'm just gonna go.

54:59.615 --> 55:02.022
Oh, no, no,
I'm really glad you came.

55:02.067 --> 55:04.337
I've been trying to get
a hold of you for a year.

55:04.383 --> 55:06.789
-Yeah? -Yeah, I never got
a chance to explain.

55:06.834 --> 55:08.741
I don't want to do this here
in front of people.

55:09.785 --> 55:11.782
But... But it's just...

55:11.828 --> 55:15.506
I don't know.
It's just so good to see you.

55:15.550 --> 55:17.865
Oh, okay.

55:17.910 --> 55:19.318
I really need to go.

55:19.363 --> 55:21.043
No, no, no, please.
Just give me another chance.

55:21.088 --> 55:24.447
I messed up, I realize that,
but I've changed.

55:24.493 --> 55:26.082
I promise.

55:26.128 --> 55:28.580
I think about you
all the time, Amanda.

55:28.625 --> 55:30.759
You stood me and my son
up on Christmas Eve.

55:30.804 --> 55:31.893
Oh, no.

55:31.938 --> 55:33.391
Oh, yes.

55:33.437 --> 55:35.616
And I'm done, Jordan.
Done.

55:35.662 --> 55:37.341
But you wouldn't have
come here

55:37.386 --> 55:39.520
if you didn't at least
feel something, right?

55:39.565 --> 55:41.744
This may come as a shock to
you, but the whole world

55:41.790 --> 55:44.696
doesn't revolve around
Jordan Riggs.

55:44.742 --> 55:47.103
I had no idea
you owned this place.

55:47.147 --> 55:50.189
Probably because you've never
told me anything about your life.

55:50.234 --> 55:52.187
Well, to be fair,
it happened really fast.

55:52.231 --> 55:55.274
So, you just happened
to walk in here, by yourself?

55:55.318 --> 55:58.087
Actually, I'm on a date.

55:58.133 --> 56:00.993
which FYI is the only reason
I would step foot in this health

56:01.039 --> 56:02.991
department nightmare
in the first place.

56:03.036 --> 56:04.625
You should have seen
it before.

56:04.670 --> 56:07.121
You know, I could have him beat
up and thrown out of here.

56:07.167 --> 56:08.439
Because, I'm the owner.

56:08.484 --> 56:09.801
I could do that.

56:09.846 --> 56:12.116
If he ever shows up,
be my guest.

56:12.162 --> 56:17.155
'Cause, yes, Jordan,
I've been stood up, again.

56:17.201 --> 56:18.562
Clearly,
I know how to pick 'em.

56:18.608 --> 56:21.649
Okay, so I stood you up
on Christmas Eve,

56:21.695 --> 56:23.784
for reasons
I'd rather not explain.

56:23.828 --> 56:26.235
-Seriously -How could you
make tha sound worse?

56:26.281 --> 56:27.641
But I've been calling
because I want you

56:27.687 --> 56:28.868
to give me another chance.

56:29.957 --> 56:31.319
I can't.

56:31.365 --> 56:32.818
It's not
just about me, Jordan.

56:32.864 --> 56:34.997
No, trust me,
Mason will understand.

56:35.043 --> 56:38.764
How could you possibly
understand what Mason feels?

56:38.810 --> 56:40.127
Never mind.

56:40.171 --> 56:42.306
O.M.G.
I know what I need to do.

56:42.351 --> 56:43.713
Do you mind?

56:43.759 --> 56:47.480
Yes, I do,
because I'm a good guy.

56:47.526 --> 56:49.207
I really like you, Amanda,

56:49.251 --> 56:51.204
so could you just
give me a chance to prove it?

56:51.249 --> 56:54.744
Wow. If I were you, I would
totally give this a shot.

56:54.789 --> 56:57.650
You don't understand.
I can't.

56:57.696 --> 57:00.237
I just can't.

57:09.181 --> 57:11.223
-It's me again. Ooh, so sorry.
-Oh!

57:11.269 --> 57:14.311
Totally forgot about the whole
sneaking up on people thing.

57:14.356 --> 57:17.942
Who are you?
And what do you want?

57:17.988 --> 57:20.077
Yeah, that's not
an easy answer.

57:20.121 --> 57:21.711
Try me.

57:23.617 --> 57:26.704
Okay, well,

57:26.750 --> 57:29.019
My name's Sarah,
and I was sent from purgatory

57:29.065 --> 57:31.880
to help you get back together with your
true love, which I'm pretty sure is Jordan,

57:31.924 --> 57:33.833
but I only have until
Christmas Eve to do it,

57:33.878 --> 57:36.192
or else I don't
get into Heaven,

57:36.238 --> 57:38.735
and I have to sit on this sad little bench
for eternity because I'm not on the list.

57:38.781 --> 57:40.460
Oh, but I can do
really cool angel-y stuff,

57:40.505 --> 57:42.730
like make it snow.

57:47.224 --> 57:50.084
So, you're an angel.

57:50.130 --> 57:51.492
Basically.

57:51.536 --> 57:53.943
And you were sent here
to help me?

57:53.989 --> 57:56.622
Totally.
Here to help you.

57:56.667 --> 57:58.211
Isn't it amazing?

58:05.020 --> 58:06.790
There, there.

58:08.652 --> 58:10.468
So you have
to help someone?

58:10.514 --> 58:13.147
Yep. Specifically,
I have to help you.

58:13.191 --> 58:15.054
Thank you.

58:15.099 --> 58:16.869
And then you get
your wings?

58:16.915 --> 58:19.048
They don't actually
have wings.

58:19.094 --> 58:21.363
Oh. I figured it was
just a figure of speech.

58:22.997 --> 58:24.905
So, is it beautiful?

58:24.950 --> 58:25.995
Heaven?

58:26.039 --> 58:27.673
I don't know yet.

58:27.719 --> 58:30.398
Oh, right.
And that's where I come in.

58:30.443 --> 58:32.803
I have to say, you're taking
this a lot better than he...

58:32.849 --> 58:35.437
Than who?

58:35.482 --> 58:38.433
Than... I expected.

58:38.478 --> 58:43.154
When I was a little girl, I was convinced
I could see angels wherever I went.

58:43.200 --> 58:44.562
Especially on
Christmas Eve.

58:44.608 --> 58:46.514
It's a busy time
of year up there.

58:46.559 --> 58:48.830
My mom and dad, they
thought it was cute at first,

58:48.875 --> 58:51.054
and then as I got older,
they got concerned

58:51.099 --> 58:54.232
that I actually believed
angels were real.

58:54.277 --> 58:55.639
Well, you were right.

58:56.819 --> 58:59.997
Apparently so.

59:00.042 --> 59:02.585
Thank you.
This is amazing.

59:02.630 --> 59:03.947
Exactly like I like it.

59:03.992 --> 59:05.445
Another one of my skills.

59:08.032 --> 59:09.713
Do you not celebrate
Christmas?

59:09.759 --> 59:11.029
Because it's fine
if you don't.

59:11.073 --> 59:12.345
I have a lot
of Jewish friends,

59:12.390 --> 59:14.570
and I'm open
to all faiths.

59:14.615 --> 59:17.475
I do,
it's just, well,

59:17.520 --> 59:19.564
my heart hasn't really
been in it this year.

59:19.609 --> 59:23.559
Well, Christmas decorations
are one of my specialties.

59:26.509 --> 59:27.644
Wow.

59:29.505 --> 59:31.821
And I really am the only one
that can see you?

59:31.866 --> 59:34.317
Yep. Now all we have to do
is figure out

59:34.363 --> 59:36.816
how to get you back
together with Jordan.

59:36.860 --> 59:40.810
-I can't do that, Sarah.
-You mean you won't?

59:40.855 --> 59:42.626
I really thought
he was the one,

59:42.670 --> 59:46.484
but he just turned out to be
another guy who can't commit.

59:46.530 --> 59:48.118
But what if it's destiny?

59:48.164 --> 59:49.799
Destiny?

59:49.844 --> 59:51.750
What happened
to free will?

59:51.796 --> 59:54.339
I mean, don't we get a say
in who we want to be with?

59:54.384 --> 59:55.700
You're right.

59:55.745 --> 59:57.834
Doesn't make any sense.

59:57.879 --> 59:59.967
All I know is I was sent
to you for a reason,

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.829
and my heart
is telling me

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:05.733
that your heart
is still a little broken.

01:00:05.778 --> 01:00:06.914
Maybe.

01:00:08.093 --> 01:00:09.274
I don't know.

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:13.405
Anyway,
I have this amazing kid,

01:00:13.451 --> 01:00:15.720
who deserves a real
father figure in his life,

01:00:15.766 --> 01:00:20.306
not some man-boy who refuses to grow up.
I have to protect his heart.

01:00:20.352 --> 01:00:23.848
Okay, well have you ever wondered why
Jordan didn't show up that night?

01:00:23.892 --> 01:00:26.344
Because he's a flake.

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:30.339
Because he was off making out with
some bimbo he likes more than me.

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:35.196
Wow, okay.
Maybe, no.

01:00:35.242 --> 01:00:38.237
Or, you know, maybe he was
trying to let go of the past,

01:00:38.283 --> 01:00:40.690
and trying to find himself,
and follow his dreams,

01:00:40.735 --> 01:00:42.143
so he could be
worthy of you.

01:00:44.458 --> 01:00:47.409
I need someone
who's all in.

01:00:47.454 --> 01:00:49.088
And I'm sorry,

01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:51.449
but Jordan Riggs
just isn't that guy.

01:00:57.669 --> 01:00:59.530
Ah.

01:01:06.566 --> 01:01:09.154
Hey, I just got the highest
score in Special Ops.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.061
No you didn't.

01:01:11.106 --> 01:01:14.647
Come on, man. Can't you
just go with it for once?

01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:16.146
Cool.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.412
This is getting weird.

01:01:21.457 --> 01:01:26.496
Why? Because you're a grown man hanging out at
an arcade with a kid in the middle of the day?

01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:28.630
Something like that.

01:01:28.675 --> 01:01:30.855
Don't you think it's time
we tell your mom the truth?

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:33.760
But she hates you.

01:01:33.804 --> 01:01:36.029
Would we use
the word "hate"?

01:01:36.075 --> 01:01:37.982
With a passion.

01:01:38.026 --> 01:01:43.248
So, if you don't ever want to see
me again, be my guest, tell her.

01:01:43.293 --> 01:01:44.745
Mason.

01:01:44.791 --> 01:01:46.789
Hold on, hold on.
I'm on level eight.

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:49.104
Mason.

01:01:49.149 --> 01:01:50.693
Dang it!

01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:52.918
Hey, what'd I tell you
about your language?

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:54.099
Okay.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:56.050
You have my undivided
attention.

01:01:56.096 --> 01:01:58.683
I can't do this anymore.

01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:02.678
Why do adults
have to ruin everything?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.626
Clearly, this arrangement
works for everyone.

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:10.123
Mom doesn't want
a man in her life,

01:02:10.169 --> 01:02:13.074
but she wants me to have a
consistent adult, role model.

01:02:13.119 --> 01:02:15.026
and you want mom,
but you can't have her,

01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:16.979
so I'm the next best thing

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:20.655
and I get to do fun stuff
on someone else's dime.

01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:23.879
Uh, I need four more
quarters, B-T-W.

01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:25.468
What's the problem?

01:02:25.514 --> 01:02:27.829
The problem is that I can't
keep hanging out with you

01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:30.598
in arcades and bowling alleys
for the rest of my life,

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:33.231
I need you to help me out,
I want your mom back.

01:02:33.277 --> 01:02:35.592
How?

01:02:35.638 --> 01:02:39.632
Well, why don't you tell her that I'm
the coolest guy you've ever met,

01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:41.312
and all those other dudes
are clowns?

01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:45.216
I'll think about it.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.986
If you don't tell her
by Christmas,

01:02:47.032 --> 01:02:48.439
I'm gonna tell her.

01:02:48.485 --> 01:02:50.254
Are you losers done?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.025
Oh. Okay, sorry.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.427
Whatever.

01:02:58.472 --> 01:03:02.103
I got hockey anyway.
We're out.

01:03:02.149 --> 01:03:04.782
Who does she think she is,
Kevin Flynn?

01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:07.551
Really? "Tron" references
on a 10-year-old?

01:03:07.597 --> 01:03:08.777
"Tron" is legit.

01:03:11.864 --> 01:03:14.088
Ow, ow!

01:03:14.134 --> 01:03:17.175
Stop!

01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:18.311
Mason.

01:03:22.578 --> 01:03:24.713
-Hey.
-Hi.

01:03:27.663 --> 01:03:29.933
Are you gonna ask him about
the kid in the Santa hat?

01:03:29.979 --> 01:03:31.113
About what kid?

01:03:31.159 --> 01:03:33.792
-What?
-Nothing.

01:03:33.836 --> 01:03:35.653
-So, how was practice?
-Fine.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:39.058
Coach is thinking about
moving me to starting goalie.

01:03:39.102 --> 01:03:42.235
Aw, goalie?
How cute is that?

01:03:43.552 --> 01:03:45.867
Catch you later, bye.

01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.953
Can we get pizza?

01:03:49.998 --> 01:03:51.860
No, darling, I've got a
Christmas work party tonight,

01:03:51.906 --> 01:03:54.402
but Carly's gonna
come over in an hour.

01:03:54.448 --> 01:03:56.399
I don't need a babysitter.

01:03:56.445 --> 01:03:58.624
I'm practically a man.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:00.486
Oh, right,
well, until I see

01:04:00.531 --> 01:04:02.120
a five-o'clock-shadow
on that face,

01:04:02.165 --> 01:04:04.526
you are getting
a babysitter.

01:04:04.571 --> 01:04:06.433
Well, can we at least
get someone fun?

01:04:06.478 --> 01:04:07.840
Well, Carly's fun.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.883
Carly makes me
do homework.

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.109
Can we get somebody
else?

01:04:11.154 --> 01:04:14.877
How about, uh,
Jordan?

01:04:14.921 --> 01:04:18.917
Oh, sweetie, Jordan's moved on with his
life now, and I think you should too.

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:20.505
Why'd you have to
break up with him?

01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:22.504
Mason, I'm not
going over this again.

01:04:22.548 --> 01:04:25.045
He was nice. Not like those
other clowns you've dated.

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.541
Excuse me?

01:04:28.587 --> 01:04:31.856
I'm just saying, wouldn't it be
nice to have him around again?

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.989
I mean, he likes you,

01:04:34.035 --> 01:04:37.440
and you used
to like him, a lot.

01:04:37.485 --> 01:04:40.481
Well, trust me,
it's better this way.

01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:41.798
And what way is that?

01:04:41.843 --> 01:04:43.931
The sad and unhappy way?

01:04:43.977 --> 01:04:47.291
You haven't laughed or done
anything fun with me in a year.

01:04:47.337 --> 01:04:49.152
We haven't even put up
a Christmas tree yet,

01:04:49.197 --> 01:04:51.194
and it's four days away.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.557
Well, it's...

01:04:52.603 --> 01:04:54.056
it's been a tough year,
Mason.

01:04:54.101 --> 01:04:55.871
So why won't you just
talk to Jordan?

01:04:55.916 --> 01:04:57.233
Because he's selfish,

01:04:57.279 --> 01:04:58.958
and he just thinks
about himself.

01:04:59.003 --> 01:05:00.320
That's not true.

01:05:00.366 --> 01:05:02.181
He pays for stuff
all the time.

01:05:02.227 --> 01:05:04.133
What do you mean
he pays for stuff?

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:09.626
Nothing.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:10.898
Mason,
what's going on?

01:05:15.392 --> 01:05:17.571
I'm sure there's
a good explanation.

01:05:17.617 --> 01:05:19.978
What, you mean, for why my son
has been going behind my back,

01:05:20.023 --> 01:05:24.200
hanging out with my
ex-boyfriend for a year?

01:05:24.244 --> 01:05:26.469
When you think about it,
it's actually really sweet.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:32.779
Not now, Carly.

01:05:32.825 --> 01:05:34.913
Okay, let's
just breathe for a sec,

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:38.590
-I mean, who does something like this?
-Why don't you ask him?

01:05:38.636 --> 01:05:40.633
Well, Mason's locked
himself in his room.

01:05:40.679 --> 01:05:42.722
Not Mason,
ask Jordan.

01:05:42.767 --> 01:05:45.037
Maybe then you'll find out
what's really going on.

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.897
Or you can sit here
and talk to an angel.

01:05:51.711 --> 01:05:54.298
Maybe you should let
the babysitter in.

01:06:04.058 --> 01:06:07.645
You need to start
talking.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:10.051
He told you.

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:11.503
This place looks beautiful.

01:06:11.549 --> 01:06:12.956
Okay, now before
you freak out,

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.863
Yeah, it's too late
for that.

01:06:14.908 --> 01:06:16.498
I'm sorry,
I should have told you...

01:06:16.543 --> 01:06:17.769
What?
That you've been hanging out

01:06:17.814 --> 01:06:18.859
in an arcade,
with a kid?

01:06:18.904 --> 01:06:21.128
He's not just a kid.

01:06:21.174 --> 01:06:24.488
-He's your kid. -Yeah, that's right.
My kid, not yours.

01:06:24.533 --> 01:06:26.304
I had no intentions
of hanging out with Mason

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:27.892
when you broke up with me,

01:06:27.938 --> 01:06:29.754
but he's been calling me,
and texting,

01:06:29.799 --> 01:06:31.752
and e-mailing me.

01:06:31.796 --> 01:06:34.203
So, he's been stalking you?

01:06:34.249 --> 01:06:36.654
Yeah. Basically.

01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:38.379
I agreed to meet him
after practice

01:06:38.425 --> 01:06:40.195
to get him off
of my back,

01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:42.420
and then I saw that jerk
Angus picking on him.

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.963
What... who?

01:06:44.009 --> 01:06:45.824
The kid who picks on him
every single day

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:48.049
that he doesn't want
to tell you about.

01:06:48.095 --> 01:06:49.911
The kid
with the Santa hat.

01:06:49.955 --> 01:06:52.952
And I told him that if
he ever needed anything,

01:06:52.997 --> 01:06:55.221
that I would always
be there for him,

01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:57.129
even if you weren't
in my life.

01:07:00.806 --> 01:07:02.032
I don't know why
I said that.

01:07:05.346 --> 01:07:08.115
I guess it's because
I was that kid, too.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.155
and I could have used
someone in my life back then.

01:07:12.201 --> 01:07:14.153
I know therapy would have
been the smarter choice,

01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:17.831
but I don't always make
the smartest choices.

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:20.145
I told you there
was an explanation.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.642
Do you realize
how crazy this is?

01:07:22.687 --> 01:07:24.821
I tried to tell you.

01:07:24.866 --> 01:07:27.863
You just wouldn't
respond to me.

01:07:27.908 --> 01:07:30.360
and Mason was so scared
that you would disapprove,

01:07:30.406 --> 01:07:32.403
he never told you.

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.810
So there it is...

01:07:33.856 --> 01:07:36.443
the truth.

01:07:36.488 --> 01:07:38.305
I'll never hang out
with Mason again,

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.938
and I understand if you
never want to see me again.

01:07:40.982 --> 01:07:44.614
So that's it, you're just
going to abandon Mason again?

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.067
What? No, I...

01:07:47.112 --> 01:07:49.291
Good, so you'll carry on doing
stuff with him then?

01:07:49.336 --> 01:07:52.423
This is so "About a Boy"
right now.

01:07:54.875 --> 01:07:56.418
You're not mad at me?

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:59.233
I just want what's best
for Mason,

01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:02.047
and right now, he needs an adult
male role model in his life.

01:08:04.363 --> 01:08:05.407
Especially if
that kid's treating him

01:08:05.453 --> 01:08:06.995
like you say he is.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:10.129
He's at a really
vulnerable age.

01:08:10.175 --> 01:08:12.081
Tell me about it.

01:08:13.896 --> 01:08:14.940
And...

01:08:14.986 --> 01:08:16.621
And...

01:08:16.666 --> 01:08:18.618
And?

01:08:18.663 --> 01:08:22.613
-Thank you.
-Thank you, I guess,

01:08:22.658 --> 01:08:24.020
for helping Mason.

01:08:27.607 --> 01:08:29.286
You can pick me up
tomorrow at 7:00,

01:08:29.332 --> 01:08:30.557
and don't be late.

01:08:33.281 --> 01:08:34.370
I'm serious.

01:08:37.684 --> 01:08:38.819
Yes.

01:09:05.966 --> 01:09:08.647
- Should we take a look?

01:09:08.691 --> 01:09:09.781
Yeah.

01:09:11.098 --> 01:09:13.050
Absolutely not.

01:09:13.095 --> 01:09:15.002
-This one?
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.482
Mm-hmm. Much better.

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:00.626
-I'd say... Are you kidding me?

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.194
Oh, thank you.

01:10:37.717 --> 01:10:39.532
All right, sorry, Philly.

01:10:39.578 --> 01:10:41.984
Private event tonight.

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:43.801
You really don't need
to do this.

01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:46.479
I own the place.
I can do whatever I want.

01:10:46.524 --> 01:10:48.294
Garçon.

01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.201
Two IPA's here, please.

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:52.607
Comin' right up.

01:10:54.196 --> 01:10:55.377
Bro-ceroni

01:10:55.423 --> 01:10:57.328
Reminder- -I am off Christmas
Eve,

01:10:57.374 --> 01:10:59.735
but Jose's covering
for me.

01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:02.912
Throwing a Festivus party
in my aunt's basement.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:04.547
Where did you find him?

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.862
Oh he showed up in a basket
on my doorstep one day.

01:11:06.907 --> 01:11:08.996
How very Moses of him.

01:11:10.403 --> 01:11:12.129
It's been such
a great night.

01:11:12.174 --> 01:11:13.808
That doesn't mean
it has to be over yet.

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:15.987
You might want
to ice your back

01:11:16.033 --> 01:11:18.076
after that epic fall
at the rink.

01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:21.071
Those poor
kindergarteners. My God.

01:11:21.117 --> 01:11:23.296
I didn't realize how awful
you are ice skating.

01:11:23.342 --> 01:11:24.659
Impressive, right?

01:11:24.703 --> 01:11:26.701
One of the many things
that I'm awful at

01:11:26.746 --> 01:11:28.381
that I can show you
more sometime.

01:11:28.427 --> 01:11:29.607
Oh, I've seen a few.

01:11:31.786 --> 01:11:34.101
Sorry, I didn't mean
that exactly.

01:11:34.146 --> 01:11:36.234
No, it's okay.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.413
You probably deserve
an explanation.

01:11:38.459 --> 01:11:39.867
I'm really sorry.

01:11:39.912 --> 01:11:42.363
Last Christmas
was really weird for me,

01:11:42.409 --> 01:11:43.861
you know,
I was going through a lot.

01:11:43.907 --> 01:11:46.540
So, why didn't you
tell me about it?

01:11:46.586 --> 01:11:48.855
Because it was about
my ex-girlfriend.

01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:53.621
Uh-oh. We don't
need to go there.

01:11:53.667 --> 01:11:57.481
What about her? Were you
with her last Christmas?

01:11:57.527 --> 01:12:01.204
No. Not really.

01:12:01.248 --> 01:12:02.293
I still had
feelings for her.

01:12:02.338 --> 01:12:03.745
and, I didn't know why,

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.970
because she totally
broke my heart.

01:12:06.016 --> 01:12:07.922
Okay, so that settles that.

01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:09.784
How about we get
some romance going in here?

01:12:15.594 --> 01:12:18.636
Ah, freaking
rats in the basement.

01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:20.634
I'll go check it out.

01:12:20.679 --> 01:12:23.766
Look, Jordan,
if you're telling me

01:12:23.812 --> 01:12:25.083
you hooked up
with your ex

01:12:25.129 --> 01:12:26.626
while we were
still together,

01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:28.442
and you expect
some kind of sympathy,

01:12:28.487 --> 01:12:31.439
-I'm not that girl.
-We didn't hook up.

01:12:31.485 --> 01:12:33.527
It was... it was just emotional.

01:12:33.572 --> 01:12:35.070
How about something
more Christmas-y?

01:12:35.116 --> 01:12:36.613
I can make it snow inside.

01:12:36.659 --> 01:12:38.384
I've got this, thank you.

01:12:38.429 --> 01:12:40.700
No, you probably don't.

01:12:40.745 --> 01:12:43.786
I just... I couldn't get her
out of my head.

01:12:43.832 --> 01:12:47.509
Literally. I thought I was
going crazy at one point.

01:12:47.555 --> 01:12:50.052
And then I realized
it was resentment and pain

01:12:50.097 --> 01:12:52.412
that was bottled up
inside of me.

01:12:52.457 --> 01:12:57.043
I just... I was holding
myself back.

01:12:57.088 --> 01:12:59.540
from connecting
with people and life.

01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:02.354
Were you with her
on Christmas Eve last year?

01:13:02.399 --> 01:13:05.487
Yes, but it
was that moment

01:13:05.577 --> 01:13:08.800
that I knew that I
had to get over her.

01:13:08.846 --> 01:13:10.253
I knew that I
had an amazing woman

01:13:10.299 --> 01:13:13.476
back at home
waiting for me.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.565
And, it was almost
midnight by then,

01:13:15.611 --> 01:13:19.243
but you know
what happened next.

01:13:21.422 --> 01:13:23.692
It's not an excuse.

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:27.278
I just want you to know
that I am totally over her.

01:13:27.323 --> 01:13:32.408
And I'm here now,
all in.

01:13:34.814 --> 01:13:39.671
Well, maybe I should thank her,
this ex-girlfriend of yours.

01:13:39.717 --> 01:13:43.395
Sarah? You can't.

01:13:43.439 --> 01:13:45.710
She unfortunately
has passed.

01:13:45.756 --> 01:13:47.935
Sarah?

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.022
Yeah.

01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:54.835
What? Is that a problem?

01:13:54.879 --> 01:13:56.514
Can you excuse me
a minute?

01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:05.322
Amanda... Amanda, stop.

01:14:08.227 --> 01:14:10.452
You're the ex-girlfriend.

01:14:10.496 --> 01:14:12.494
I know, I should
have told you sooner.

01:14:12.539 --> 01:14:14.719
What kind of sick
game are you playing?

01:14:14.764 --> 01:14:17.353
I'm not playing a game. I was
sent back to help you, I promise.

01:14:17.397 --> 01:14:19.122
And why should I
believe you?

01:14:19.168 --> 01:14:21.529
Amanda, I know I should have
told you about Jordan,

01:14:21.574 --> 01:14:24.297
but that doesn't mean that the two
of you aren't meant to be together.

01:14:24.343 --> 01:14:25.660
I don't want to hear it.

01:14:25.705 --> 01:14:28.928
You're... you're an angel

01:14:28.974 --> 01:14:30.154
with an agenda.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.335
No, I'm not.

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.832
I mean, yes.
I mean...

01:14:32.877 --> 01:14:34.558
You're not an angel.

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:35.964
You're the devil.

01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:37.281
Go away!

01:14:37.327 --> 01:14:41.458
You two, you both
deserve each other.

01:14:41.503 --> 01:14:43.773
Amanda, I don't understand
what went wrong.

01:14:43.818 --> 01:14:47.177
I can't do this. I can't
be with you, and...

01:14:47.223 --> 01:14:50.674
and be haunted by some woman
from your past.

01:14:50.719 --> 01:14:52.625
-It's not like that.
-It's not like that.

01:14:54.397 --> 01:14:56.847
Amanda. Amanda.

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:58.710
She's gone.

01:14:58.755 --> 01:14:59.890
She's gone.

01:15:18.412 --> 01:15:20.455
What's wrong?

01:15:20.501 --> 01:15:24.359
I'm fine.

01:15:24.404 --> 01:15:25.812
Is Jordan coming
over tonight?

01:15:27.219 --> 01:15:29.035
Eat your chow mein.

01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:32.486
I don't want to be late
for midnight mass.

01:15:32.531 --> 01:15:34.711
Okay.

01:15:43.063 --> 01:15:44.471
It's Christmas,

01:15:44.516 --> 01:15:47.194
I'm alone,

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.829
and I've ruined everything.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:56.228
It is Christmas,
but you're not alone.

01:15:56.274 --> 01:16:00.450
I ran out of time,
right?

01:16:00.496 --> 01:16:02.630
I'm not on the list,
am I?

01:16:07.078 --> 01:16:10.620
Okay.

01:16:12.617 --> 01:16:14.751
Are you ready?

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.652
Wait, I can't just
leave them like this.

01:16:20.697 --> 01:16:23.649
Jordan's miserable,
and Amanda really loves him,

01:16:23.695 --> 01:16:25.964
she just doesn't trust it.

01:16:26.009 --> 01:16:29.868
Can I just have a little more
time to fix what I've messed up?

01:16:29.914 --> 01:16:31.321
Please?

01:16:32.864 --> 01:16:34.408
They don't deserve
to be punished

01:16:34.454 --> 01:16:36.678
just because I can't
seem to do anything right.

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:40.628
I don't want this to be
how I leave this world.

01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:44.986
I see the way
he looks at her,

01:16:45.031 --> 01:16:48.209
and how she just wants
him in her life,

01:16:48.255 --> 01:16:50.252
and how Mason
just wants a dad.

01:16:50.296 --> 01:16:52.976
Jordan would make
a really great dad.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:59.240
They just need
a little faith.

01:17:02.373 --> 01:17:04.370
You told me to figure out
what my heart really wants.

01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:09.546
It wants to help them
be a family.

01:17:11.725 --> 01:17:15.901
Please, can I just
give it one more try?

01:17:19.578 --> 01:17:23.210
I'm really not supposed
to do this,

01:17:23.256 --> 01:17:25.299
but I can't help it.

01:17:25.344 --> 01:17:28.204
I like you, Sarah.

01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:30.655
Okay, I can't help you
get on the list,

01:17:30.701 --> 01:17:35.241
but I can give you another hour
to help Jordan and Amanda.

01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:38.464
-Thank you.
-But that's it.

01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:40.689
An hour, okay.

01:17:40.735 --> 01:17:45.365
I just wish I could talk to Jordan
and tell him what he needs to do.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.998
Well, I can't make
people see you,

01:17:48.043 --> 01:17:51.539
but there is a way
they can hear you.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.945
What? How?

01:17:59.575 --> 01:18:02.252
It's called,
The Angel's Whisper.

01:18:02.298 --> 01:18:05.431
It's a powerful tool.

01:18:05.475 --> 01:18:06.792
Wow.

01:18:06.838 --> 01:18:08.654
But don't go crazy,

01:18:08.699 --> 01:18:11.650
Getting into people's heads and
controlling what they say

01:18:11.695 --> 01:18:14.465
is a delicate art
for any spirit being.

01:18:16.371 --> 01:18:17.642
Wow.

01:18:19.005 --> 01:18:20.820
Whew!

01:18:20.866 --> 01:18:22.636
It doesn't hurt,
they just think

01:18:22.682 --> 01:18:25.542
that they've
dosed off for a second.

01:18:25.588 --> 01:18:28.266
Do you think
you can handle it?

01:18:28.311 --> 01:18:30.036
-Thank you.
-Mmm-kay.

01:18:30.082 --> 01:18:34.304
-Call me when you're ready.
-Okay.

01:18:37.527 --> 01:18:38.844
Feats of strength!

01:18:38.889 --> 01:18:40.478
Feats of strength!

01:18:40.523 --> 01:18:41.749
Feats of strength!

01:19:12.301 --> 01:19:13.891
Getting
out of here, buddy.

01:19:13.935 --> 01:19:17.613
Merry Christmas.

01:19:23.152 --> 01:19:24.560
Come on!

01:19:29.235 --> 01:19:32.321
I have to go now.

01:19:52.796 --> 01:19:53.932
Hey, Stu,
what's going on?

01:19:53.977 --> 01:19:56.383
No time for talking,
just doing.

01:19:56.428 --> 01:19:57.881
What?

01:19:57.926 --> 01:19:59.742
Tonight is about helping
those in need.

01:19:59.788 --> 01:20:02.376
Dude, seriously
is everything all right?

01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:04.737
Yeah.

01:20:04.781 --> 01:20:06.189
Is that jacket Dolce?

01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:10.729
I mean, yeah, bro.
Everything's fine.

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:12.364
Just come on.

01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:20.172
Wait here.
I'll be right back

01:20:20.217 --> 01:20:25.529
Wait, Stu.
What are we doing?

01:20:25.574 --> 01:20:27.708
Is that wine?

01:20:27.753 --> 01:20:31.430
Uh, yeah. Are you
supposed to have this?

01:20:37.104 --> 01:20:38.920
Psst.

01:20:40.373 --> 01:20:42.370
Yes, you.
Come here.

01:20:48.137 --> 01:20:50.543
Stuart,
what are you doing here?

01:20:50.588 --> 01:20:52.313
Thought I'd meet you.

01:20:52.358 --> 01:20:53.811
Meet? What for?

01:21:05.978 --> 01:21:07.068
Ahem.

01:21:12.061 --> 01:21:14.785
What are you doing here?

01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:16.692
It's Christmas Eve.

01:21:18.735 --> 01:21:22.775
We're all here
for different reasons.

01:21:22.821 --> 01:21:24.545
Amanda,
what happened last night?

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.495
Not here, Jordan.

01:21:28.541 --> 01:21:31.945
Well, if you can't speak
your heart on Christmas,

01:21:31.991 --> 01:21:33.307
when can you?

01:21:35.714 --> 01:21:37.619
Go ahead.

01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:44.748
Tell him about her.
About Sarah.

01:21:44.794 --> 01:21:46.745
Stuart, what are
you talking about?

01:21:46.791 --> 01:21:53.692
The truth.
What have you got to lose?

01:21:53.736 --> 01:21:55.507
Hey, don't listen
to him, he's...

01:21:55.552 --> 01:21:59.410
I can see Sarah.

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:01.273
Sarah talks to you?

01:22:01.319 --> 01:22:04.904
Like, as if she was real?

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:09.352
She said she came to help me
fall back in love with you.

01:22:09.398 --> 01:22:11.261
I know it sounds crazy, but...

01:22:11.306 --> 01:22:13.892
I knew I wasn't going nuts.

01:22:13.938 --> 01:22:17.616
Wait, is Sarah here
right now?

01:22:17.662 --> 01:22:19.340
No.

01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:24.788
Are you in love
with me?

01:22:24.834 --> 01:22:26.378
You don't want
to be with me, Jordan.

01:22:26.423 --> 01:22:28.284
Yes, I do Amanda,
with all my heart.

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:29.873
What can I say
to make you believe that?

01:22:29.918 --> 01:22:32.052
All this time,
I kept thinking

01:22:32.097 --> 01:22:33.596
that you were the one
with the problem,

01:22:33.641 --> 01:22:37.500
that you were the one
in a mess, but it was me.

01:22:37.545 --> 01:22:42.176
I'm a workaholic,
I have huge trust issues.

01:22:42.221 --> 01:22:44.900
I have no idea what's
going on in my son's life,

01:22:44.945 --> 01:22:46.806
and I talk to angels.

01:22:46.852 --> 01:22:52.118
So do I.
I can hear her too.

01:22:52.164 --> 01:22:56.113
At least I did.

01:22:56.158 --> 01:22:59.291
Honestly, I don't
even know anymore.

01:22:59.336 --> 01:23:04.739
But you know what?
None of that matters now.

01:23:04.783 --> 01:23:06.328
Why?

01:23:06.373 --> 01:23:09.278
Because now
I'm here with you,

01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:11.094
if you'll have me.

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.865
If you and Mason will
give me another shot,

01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:15.180
I promise I will
never let you down.

01:23:17.677 --> 01:23:19.175
Never.

01:23:19.221 --> 01:23:25.168
I am all in,
so what so you say?

01:23:29.526 --> 01:23:32.931
Merry Christmas.

01:24:35.489 --> 01:24:37.078
- Hey!
- Hey, bud.

01:24:37.124 --> 01:24:38.258
You did a great job.

01:24:38.304 --> 01:24:40.119
It was a little
long though.

01:24:40.165 --> 01:24:41.845
Are you having Christmas
at our house?

01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:44.342
If you want me to.

01:24:45.567 --> 01:24:47.656
Totally!

01:24:47.701 --> 01:24:49.516
Aw.

01:24:49.562 --> 01:24:51.877
We better get going
if you want Santa to come.

01:24:51.923 --> 01:24:54.601
Mom, there's
no such thing as Santa.

01:24:54.647 --> 01:24:56.417
Is there?

01:24:56.463 --> 01:24:59.823
Kid, these days,
I believe in everything.

01:24:59.867 --> 01:25:01.184
Hey, just hold on
one second.

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:02.954
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.679
- Good job.
- Okay, let's go.

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:07.450
That was so good,
I'm so proud.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.604
Sarah, I just wanted to say
thank you for all of this...

01:25:28.650 --> 01:25:30.284
for them.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.369
Jordan, wait.

01:25:35.414 --> 01:25:37.548
It's me.

01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:55.253
Sarah?

01:25:57.205 --> 01:26:00.066
I just needed
another minute...

01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:05.648
here with you.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.738
You've been here
the whole time, haven't you?

01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:13.821
And you don't
have to worry.

01:26:13.866 --> 01:26:16.907
I'm not gonna
come back again.

01:26:16.953 --> 01:26:19.132
I think you and Amanda will
be really happy together.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.902
Thank you.

01:26:25.534 --> 01:26:26.668
Why are you crying?

01:26:33.433 --> 01:26:38.200
Because I'm scared.

01:26:40.605 --> 01:26:41.921
It didn't work,
did it?

01:26:47.551 --> 01:26:49.912
I'm so sorry.

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:52.681
But Sarah,
you're a good person.

01:26:52.727 --> 01:26:54.543
I know that.

01:26:54.589 --> 01:26:55.995
And whatever comes
next for you,

01:26:56.041 --> 01:27:01.761
I know you'll be okay.

01:27:09.932 --> 01:27:12.066
Bye, Jordan.

01:27:12.111 --> 01:27:13.246
I love you.

01:27:17.196 --> 01:27:18.694
Goodbye, Sarah.

01:27:27.592 --> 01:27:31.224
What just happened?

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:32.768
I think you just
saw an angel.

01:27:41.984 --> 01:27:43.300
Can we just get
this over with?

01:27:45.297 --> 01:27:51.018
Sarah? I want
to show you something.

01:27:51.064 --> 01:27:54.559
Oh, is there an ever sadder place for
people who don't have any reservation?

01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:58.735
What?

01:28:00.369 --> 01:28:02.095
But I ran out of time.

01:28:02.141 --> 01:28:04.001
It's funny.

01:28:04.047 --> 01:28:07.497
Love always seems
to beat time.

01:28:07.543 --> 01:28:08.813
I don't understand.

01:28:08.859 --> 01:28:10.902
You fell in love.

01:28:10.947 --> 01:28:15.350
Maybe not romantically, but management
doesn't really differentiate.

01:28:15.396 --> 01:28:17.349
When you truly
love someone,

01:28:17.395 --> 01:28:18.619
you act with your heart,

01:28:18.665 --> 01:28:20.026
not your head.

01:28:20.072 --> 01:28:21.933
Your name was added
to the list

01:28:21.978 --> 01:28:23.886
because you helped
Jordan and Amanda

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:28.379
and Mason become a family,
even when you knew

01:28:28.425 --> 01:28:30.558
that you weren't going
to get into Heaven.

01:28:32.239 --> 01:28:35.508
You needed to perform
a true act of love

01:28:35.553 --> 01:28:37.141
to get on the list.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:39.275
Ah.

01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:41.727
So I got my wings.

01:28:41.772 --> 01:28:43.271
Well, angels don't
really have...

01:28:43.316 --> 01:28:45.677
what the heck?
Yeah, you got your wings!

01:28:46.857 --> 01:28:48.264
So, whenever you're ready,

01:28:48.309 --> 01:28:50.670
you just walk through
those gates.

01:28:55.256 --> 01:28:58.025
-What's the matter?
-It's just...

01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:59.568
You don't want to go?

01:29:03.381 --> 01:29:06.695
I know this
is crazy, but...

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:09.329
I want what they have, I
want to feel what they feel.

01:29:09.374 --> 01:29:11.690
I want to feel pain,
and passion,

01:29:11.735 --> 01:29:14.731
and love, and I want my
heart broken, and mended.

01:29:14.777 --> 01:29:17.455
What if I want to start
a family of my own?

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.271
If I walk through
those gates,

01:29:19.317 --> 01:29:21.359
it's over.

01:29:21.405 --> 01:29:23.220
I mean, I'm sure the food
and drinks are amazing,

01:29:23.266 --> 01:29:26.261
but...

01:29:26.307 --> 01:29:29.213
none of this makes
any sense.

01:29:29.259 --> 01:29:32.573
Why did I have to die?

01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:36.386
Sometimes it takes dying
to realize you want to live.

01:29:41.561 --> 01:29:42.650
I don't want to die.

01:29:46.827 --> 01:29:51.096
I'm sure your reservations
have a no cancellation policy,

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:55.090
I'm sure I can't just
send myself back.

01:29:55.135 --> 01:29:58.449
No.

01:29:58.495 --> 01:29:59.947
But I can.

01:30:12.931 --> 01:30:14.657
Are you okay?

01:30:14.702 --> 01:30:17.380
Oh my God, you
almost got yourself killed.

01:30:17.426 --> 01:30:19.605
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:30:32.997 --> 01:30:34.132
You sure you're okay?

01:30:35.993 --> 01:30:38.127
Yeah. I think so.

01:30:38.172 --> 01:30:40.578
-How did you know I was
-I found it in the door,

01:30:40.624 --> 01:30:41.986
and then I saw you,

01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:43.212
just standing here.

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:46.888
That's one lucky scarf.

01:30:48.796 --> 01:30:51.565
God, I'm Hank,
by the way.

01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:53.744
Hey.

01:30:53.789 --> 01:30:55.242
You sure you're okay?

01:30:55.288 --> 01:30:56.377
I'm better than okay.

01:30:57.739 --> 01:30:59.146
I'm alive.

01:31:01.643 --> 01:31:03.141
-May I... Yeah.

01:31:05.274 --> 01:31:06.500
Hey.

01:31:16.897 --> 01:31:18.168
Let's get you inside.

01:31:18.214 --> 01:31:20.211
Yeah.

01:31:20.257 --> 01:31:23.298
Do you believe
in Christmas miracles?
