WEBVTT

00:03.755 --> 00:05.546
Charlie, please.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.380
Please let me sign your cast.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.740
No. You laughed when I
fell and hurt my wrist.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.460
You will never sign this cast.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.880
What? Are you guys still
arguing about this?

00:13.940 --> 00:15.200
You're supposed to be adults.

00:15.220 --> 00:18.540
You have a combined age of 140.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.220
I'm sorry, it was funny when he fell.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.060
He was carrying a hot fudge sundae

00:23.090 --> 00:25.483
and the cherry landed
on his belly button.

00:25.568 --> 00:27.735
I'm only human.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.320
Hank, please talk some
sense into these two.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.907
I'd like to, but I was unaware of
the cherry in the belly button.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.700
That changes everything.

00:34.827 --> 00:38.204
Friends let friends sign their casts.

00:38.331 --> 00:41.350
You're right. Friends do let
friends sign their casts.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.780
Hank, would you, uh, be so kind?

00:43.830 --> 00:45.400
And Margaret.

00:45.430 --> 00:49.400
Oh, great. Hank is signing
in the spot I picked out.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.040
This is outrageous.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.600
Do you think that you two could,
uh, settle this by recess?

00:55.620 --> 00:58.090
My friend Joanie is gonna
stop by today. I want to

00:58.140 --> 01:00.070
show her how awesome
my new life is here.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.010
You have other friends than us?

01:02.060 --> 01:03.600
Yeah, don't you guys?

01:06.480 --> 01:08.390
Okay. Well...

01:08.480 --> 01:10.740
Joanie and I got divorced
around the same time,

01:10.780 --> 01:12.890
and when we met we became inseparable.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.780
You guys are gonna love her. She paints,

01:14.820 --> 01:17.100
she sculpts, she makes jewelry...

01:17.140 --> 01:19.660
Still waiting for the stuff we'll love.

01:19.740 --> 01:21.840
Oh. Well, I forgot to mention

01:21.860 --> 01:23.990
she also farts the alphabet.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.660
Seriously?

01:25.750 --> 01:28.000
No, but I can burp the
Pledge of Allegiance.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.710
Oh!

01:29.740 --> 01:32.380
Joanie! Wow!

01:32.400 --> 01:34.880
- Did you just get back from Oldchella?
- Oh!

01:34.960 --> 01:36.670
Oh, you're bad.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.930
Does this morgue have a bar?

01:42.010 --> 01:44.440
Hey, Joanie, meet Sid, Charlie,

01:44.480 --> 01:45.970
- and Hank.
- Hi.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.560
Small, medium, and large.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.810
I love it.

01:49.900 --> 01:53.020
Would you like to sign my cast?

01:53.110 --> 01:54.900
Be honored.

01:54.980 --> 01:56.070
What?!

01:56.150 --> 01:58.320
You don't even know her.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.140
Oh, a heart over the I...

02:00.200 --> 02:01.530
real original, Joanie.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.700
You're a frigging trailblazer.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.880
And when you grabbed that guy's keys...

02:30.910 --> 02:34.060
Yeah! And then back at the hotel...

02:34.190 --> 02:37.690
You guys should have seen the
look on the pool boy's face.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.350
This is the fifth story you told today

02:41.380 --> 02:43.610
that doesn't have a beginning,
a middle or an end.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.620
Yeah, ladies, I feel like I'm
watching Harry Potter...

02:46.700 --> 02:50.200
I'm not sure what's going
on and I'm not sure I care.

02:50.330 --> 02:53.060
You've really been
talking this place up,

02:53.110 --> 02:55.570
but it... as far as I can
see, at first glance,

02:55.590 --> 02:57.700
it seems a little sleepy.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.800
Oh, that's 'cause you looking at Larry.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.080
It also seems like a place
where people come to die.

03:05.110 --> 03:07.560
No. You're thinking of a nursing home.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.470
This is a retirement community.

03:09.520 --> 03:12.890
Nothing but sex, drugs, and sex-drugs.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.340
In all fairness, a lot
of people do die here.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.860
It's like a horror movie
without the suspense.

03:19.940 --> 03:21.780
So what's the plan tonight?

03:21.860 --> 03:23.950
How far away is Tijuana?

03:23.980 --> 03:25.950
Oh, no. We can't go back there.

03:25.980 --> 03:28.240
Those nuns'll still be looking for us.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.330
Margaret's got much cooler
plans than that for tonight.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.960
We are going to the Shady Meadows Luau.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.460
I, for one, hope to get lei'd.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.100
The lei, of course,

03:41.130 --> 03:43.470
- is a flowery necklace from Hawaii.
- Yeah.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.720
It also means sex.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.760
A clever play on words.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.980
Now, Joanie, you gonna help Margaret,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.610
who will assume her usual role
as my, uh, honey funneler.

03:59.730 --> 04:02.099
- Honey funneler?
- That is right.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.700
She funnels the honeys to me.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.440
I woo them with my humor.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.200
And the next thing you know,
I got an apple in my mouth

04:07.330 --> 04:09.530
and a grass skirt on my bedroom floor.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.660
Yeah?

04:10.790 --> 04:12.450
We're not doing that.

04:12.540 --> 04:13.749
Margaret, shall we?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.210
Yeah, yeah, I... Sorry Hank.

04:15.230 --> 04:16.749
Uh, we're out for ourselves tonight.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.250
You're gonna have to
funnel your own honey.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.130
Okay, Charlie.

04:21.170 --> 04:24.300
I bought you pineapple,
ham and cornichons.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.340
Or, as you like to call
them, "little pickles."

04:26.470 --> 04:29.890
Which, coincidentally, was
my nickname in junior high.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.260
Charlie, I'm sorry I laughed.

04:32.350 --> 04:34.180
Now can I sign your cast?

04:34.270 --> 04:35.579
No.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.400
And I'm gonna need more little
pickles, Little Pickles.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.570
I didn't say I liked that nickname.

04:41.690 --> 04:44.610
There are actually a lot of cute
guys here at Sweaty Middles.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.570
Shady Meadows.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.350
And that's what I've
been trying to tell you.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.740
This is like a college dorm,

04:49.770 --> 04:53.040
except everybody's got
macular degeneration.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.700
Hey, girl.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.510
Are you that offensive
graffiti somebody painted

04:57.540 --> 04:59.880
on the grocery store?
'Cause I can't believe

04:59.920 --> 05:02.090
nobody's taken you off the market.

05:03.630 --> 05:06.590
Swing and a miss.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.920
Damn that Joanie.

05:07.950 --> 05:09.590
She's hogging my wing woman.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.430
It's fine. I don't need her.

05:15.520 --> 05:16.850
Check this out.

05:16.940 --> 05:21.060
Baby doll, are you my 1970 Chevelle

05:21.090 --> 05:22.360
that I backed into a tree?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.570
'Cause your trunk is on fire.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.610
Wow, she didn't even slow down.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.160
You know, Charlie, keep in mind,

05:31.240 --> 05:33.370
many of these women are lesbians.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.500
Thank you.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.080
Well, Margaret didn't show again.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.960
I ended up having to eat her breakfast.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.760
You didn't have to.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.820
Not only did she ignore us at the luau,

05:49.840 --> 05:51.220
she totally stood me up

05:51.260 --> 05:54.260
for our RuPaul's Drag
Race marathon last night.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.020
I made 100 mini pizzas.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.550
I had to eat them all by myself.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.520
Well, again, you didn't have to.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.380
Well, she stood me up this morning, too.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.190
We were supposed to go
golfing this morning.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.030
I get paired with Dudley.

06:09.070 --> 06:11.360
That man shot a 462.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.530
We only golfed nine holes.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.880
Yeah, Joanie is throwing
everything out of whack.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.040
You know, Margaret's the one

06:18.060 --> 06:20.040
that always tells me
when my fly is open,

06:20.170 --> 06:21.540
and look at that...

06:21.670 --> 06:24.630
wide open.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.960
Not only is Joanie stealing
our friend, but with

06:28.090 --> 06:29.670
Charlie icing me out,

06:29.720 --> 06:32.090
I'm basically down to one: you, Hank.

06:32.180 --> 06:35.390
Would you like to watch
RuPaul's Drag Race tonight?

06:35.470 --> 06:38.180
No, I don't want to watch
RuPaul's Drag Race with you.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.470
That's the last thing I need,

06:39.480 --> 06:41.080
is to fall in love
with one of them gals.

06:42.120 --> 06:45.480
I am too old to be
questioning my sexuality.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
That is a Margaret show.

06:47.530 --> 06:49.330
And I'm gonna tell her
as soon as she shows up.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.020
You know, I have had it with her.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.620
I'm gonna tell her she needs to
get this Joanie up out of here.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.800
Hey, guys!

06:55.820 --> 06:58.580
I come bearing great news,

06:58.660 --> 07:01.080
and morning hooch.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.960
We're gonna have to
pull a fifth chair up

07:03.040 --> 07:05.960
to this table, because...

07:06.090 --> 07:07.960
I'm moving in.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.630
Yay.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.930
Woo-hoo.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.890
Yup, my lease was up,

07:23.980 --> 07:25.520
my best friend lives here...

07:25.560 --> 07:26.940
what's not to love?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.360
I'm heading over to the
sales office right now.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.200
Yup. We found out there's
a unit available.

07:36.270 --> 07:39.050
Tippy Kominsky's family
just pulled the plug.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.330
How great is that?

07:41.410 --> 07:43.480
Oh, no, Tippy died?

07:43.500 --> 07:45.170
She owed me money.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.800
Margaret, we need to talk. Now,
how do I say this delicately?

07:50.920 --> 07:52.440
We don't like this Joanie

07:52.470 --> 07:54.760
and we like you less
when you around her.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.050
What? Where is this coming from?

07:57.100 --> 08:00.490
Margaret, you're blowing
off your obligation to us

08:00.520 --> 08:02.390
to hang out with this Joanie.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.979
Now, when you sat down at this table

08:04.980 --> 08:06.770
and joined this group of friends,

08:06.800 --> 08:08.110
you signed a contract.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.980
- I didn't sign anything.
- Yes, you did.

08:11.070 --> 08:13.940
Your butt cheek was the pen.

08:14.030 --> 08:16.490
That chair was the paper.

08:16.570 --> 08:18.620
When you put butt cheek pen

08:18.700 --> 08:20.370
to chair paper,

08:20.490 --> 08:23.040
a contract was signed

08:23.080 --> 08:26.370
and sealed, and you are forever bound.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.630
Wow, we really need to get you laid.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.970
If it's hard for you to tell her
she can't move in, I can do it.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.679
I'll be firm but bitchy.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.140
Why don't you let me be firm but bitchy?

08:41.270 --> 08:44.059
Not exactly a stretch.

08:45.730 --> 08:48.060
You guys are freaking out over nothing.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.230
I can be friends with you
and with Joanie, too.

08:50.270 --> 08:53.230
We can all get along if you
will just give her a chance.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.820
Charlie, your fly is down.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.150
Yeah. And I had to figure
that out on my own.

08:58.370 --> 09:01.620
Well, honey, if you figured it
out, then why's it still down?

09:02.800 --> 09:05.440
Hank, Joanie's really great,
just give her a shot.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.800
Okay? Go talk to her. You will like her.

09:07.830 --> 09:10.710
We'll make an amendment to
your butt cheek contract.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.420
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.840
But just remember:

09:13.900 --> 09:16.550
chair contract, butt cheek pen.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.050
Butt cheek paper doesn't
even make sense.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.680
Think, woman.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.020
- Geez.
- Hey.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.190
Margaret said I should get
to know you, so, uh...

09:33.280 --> 09:36.400
what's your favorite food?

09:36.530 --> 09:40.360
That is a really weird way
to start a conversation.

09:40.450 --> 09:42.530
But...

09:42.620 --> 09:44.540
popcorn.

09:44.570 --> 09:46.450
You kidding me?

09:46.470 --> 09:49.160
So you on your way to the electric chair

09:49.210 --> 09:51.300
and they ask you what your last meal is,

09:51.340 --> 09:53.500
you gonna tell them popcorn?

09:54.630 --> 09:56.380
All right, I'll tell Margaret I tried.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.170
Oh, Hank.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.370
If you have a problem with me,

10:00.400 --> 10:02.550
why don't you just come
right out and say it?

10:02.640 --> 10:04.180
Oh, I'll do you one better,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.560
I'll come right out and say it.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.390
We don't want to have you here.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.390
Really, Hank?

10:11.900 --> 10:14.770
You don't think it could be fun to...

10:14.900 --> 10:16.900
have me?

10:17.950 --> 10:20.360
I think... maybe it...

10:20.420 --> 10:21.910
might be fun to have you.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.990
Well, maybe you should
take me on a little tour,

10:27.120 --> 10:30.290
so I can get a better
feel for the place.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.710
Feel?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.650
And then after you show me around,

10:36.680 --> 10:39.920
maybe I could check out... your unit.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.680
Say what now?

10:42.720 --> 10:45.430
- You want to see my unit?
- Yeah.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.510
Well, this is gonna be a short-ass tour.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.260
Get well soon...

10:55.280 --> 10:57.900
you fragile...

10:57.990 --> 11:00.360
bastard.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.300
He's using up all the free space,

11:02.340 --> 11:04.490
and everything he's writing is mean.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.620
Love...

11:06.700 --> 11:09.580
your nemesis...

11:09.660 --> 11:11.960
Gorgeous George.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.540
Toodle-oo, bird-bones.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.620
Do you think Hank and
Joanie are still talking?

11:18.650 --> 11:21.470
I promise you guys are gonna
love having her around.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.580
Good evening, everyone.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.010
And what a good, good evening it is.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.310
Hoo-ee!

11:29.430 --> 11:31.700
Oh, Joanie, you didn't.

11:31.730 --> 11:32.890
I did.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.770
Twice.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.560
Did what?

11:37.940 --> 11:39.730
Ooh, yuck.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.400
How did this happen?

11:49.440 --> 11:50.659
When did this happen?

11:50.660 --> 11:54.330
Above all, why did this happen?

11:54.420 --> 11:56.180
Well, Hank headed over to the rec room

11:56.200 --> 11:59.130
to give me the business,
and... I took it.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.680
I was giv... I was giving
her a little tour.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.170
And then there was

12:06.200 --> 12:08.980
- this noisy bird.
- And I said...

12:09.020 --> 12:11.270
I said, "Shut up, bird!"

12:13.310 --> 12:16.140
And that's basically how it happened.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.650
Twice.

12:18.730 --> 12:22.900
Can anyone tell a complete
story around here?

12:23.030 --> 12:25.170
Okay, well, we'll catch
up with you guys later.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.380
We're gonna hit the tennis court.

12:26.410 --> 12:28.990
Oh, Hank, you don't even play tennis.

12:29.030 --> 12:30.830
I do now.

12:30.910 --> 12:34.780
Oh, guys, this is really not good.

12:34.860 --> 12:37.080
I know. Friends hooking up with friends

12:37.120 --> 12:39.670
is terrible for group dynamics.

12:39.700 --> 12:43.000
And I should know, I have seen
all 14 seasons of Road Rules,

12:43.040 --> 12:46.590
even the almost unwatchable
"Semester at Sea."

12:48.080 --> 12:51.270
Okay, but it's not just that.
Hank is really into her,

12:51.300 --> 12:54.230
and Joanie is really
into chewing up guys

12:54.260 --> 12:56.520
and spitting them out.
I got to talk to her.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.890
Well, keep your guard up.

12:57.930 --> 13:00.190
She banged the last
person that tried that.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.620
Afternoon, ladies!

13:14.160 --> 13:17.000
Yep, that's right. Broke my neck.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.630
I tripped over a cat.

13:20.710 --> 13:24.430
All my friends laughed, but
I didn't even get mad,

13:24.460 --> 13:28.050
'cause everyone knows that
people falling is funny!

13:29.680 --> 13:31.430
Anyhoo...

13:31.560 --> 13:33.100
you want to sign my brace?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.520
Give me a break, Sid.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.220
You didn't hurt yourself.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.890
Who's that talking?

13:38.020 --> 13:41.520
I can barely turn with
this pesky broken neck.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.640
Oh, sweet Charlie, it's you.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.470
You probably want to sign my brace,

13:49.490 --> 13:53.580
but the space is reserved
for all of my true friends.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.910
Shirley, Betty and...

13:54.930 --> 13:56.330
this one.

13:58.060 --> 14:01.050
If you're trying to make me
jealous, it will not work.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.970
I haven't been jealous since 1980,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.270
when my ex-wife slept
with the Jackson 4.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.960
Michael wasn't interested.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.880
Oh, Charlie!

14:09.970 --> 14:11.680
Enough!

14:12.600 --> 14:14.420
I didn't hurt my neck.

14:14.430 --> 14:17.560
What's hurting is my heart.

14:17.580 --> 14:19.410
When you don't let me sign your cast,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.380
I feel like I'm not your friend,

14:21.400 --> 14:23.810
and I don't like the way that feels.

14:23.900 --> 14:26.290
Well, then you shouldn't have
laughed at me for being old.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.300
You know, I can't get
around like I used to,

14:28.340 --> 14:30.020
but I don't see anything
funny about that.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.140
I didn't laugh because you're old.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.020
Age has nothing to do with it.

14:36.060 --> 14:37.899
Just the other day

14:37.900 --> 14:40.120
I laughed at this little girl

14:40.180 --> 14:42.000
who fell down at the mall.

14:42.150 --> 14:43.850
You promise?

14:43.960 --> 14:47.340
She fell down the up escalator.

14:47.460 --> 14:50.340
But it brought her right back up.

14:50.470 --> 14:53.140
Oh... oh, yeah.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.510
- I-I get it, I get it. Here.
- Oh.

14:55.640 --> 14:58.080
Thank you. Oh, I don't
know what to write,

14:58.100 --> 14:59.810
there are so many options.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.200
Do you still want me to
sign your brace, Sid?

15:02.230 --> 15:04.900
No, Shirley. God!

15:04.980 --> 15:07.700
You're friggin' obsessed with me.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.880
Ooh. Hot damn!

15:12.980 --> 15:15.740
Tippy's place is really swanky.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.530
Nothing but the best for
my Joanie Macaroni.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.790
Here's a little
housewarming gift for you.

15:20.870 --> 15:23.320
- Thank you. Mm.
- Hey, uh, Hank,

15:23.340 --> 15:25.170
do you think I could have a
minute alone with Joanie?

15:25.210 --> 15:27.520
Yeah. I'll go look for
Tippy, see if she's

15:27.540 --> 15:29.630
- moved on to the afterlife.
- Okay.

15:29.670 --> 15:32.170
Sweet spirit! Show thyself!

15:33.880 --> 15:37.340
So, uh, you and Hank seem
to be having a good time.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.640
How do you feel about him?

15:38.660 --> 15:40.850
Oh, he's fine. He seems
to be really into me.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.320
He kind of reminds me of the
guy that I used to date

15:44.340 --> 15:46.419
in Colorado Springs who
had the banjo and...

15:46.420 --> 15:47.759
No, no, no, no.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.700
We're not turning Hank
into one of our stories.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.940
He's my friend, and I don't
want to see him get hurt.

15:52.070 --> 15:53.800
We're just having a little fun.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.160
No one's gonna get hurt.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.360
Well, well, well.

15:59.060 --> 16:02.660
Joanie, are you ready to put
the "happy" in happy hour?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.000
- Uh, George.
- Hmm?

16:04.080 --> 16:06.560
I thought we were going
to meet downstairs.

16:06.580 --> 16:08.330
So you have a date with George?

16:08.420 --> 16:10.790
I thought you said Hank
wasn't gonna get hurt.

16:10.840 --> 16:13.000
He's not. George and I
are just gonna head out,

16:13.020 --> 16:16.340
and you can tell Hank that I
went to see the Grand Canyon.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.080
He's not an idiot.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.300
Bad news... Tippy's not
ready to leave yet.

16:21.390 --> 16:23.310
I think I've angered her.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.180
What are you doing here?

16:25.270 --> 16:27.770
I'm here to pick up Joanie.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.350
I can't believe you're going out

16:29.380 --> 16:31.650
with this Vincent Price knockoff.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.530
Joanie...

16:34.610 --> 16:36.800
why are you holding those weeds?

16:36.820 --> 16:40.240
- Here, let me upgrade you, girl.
- I gave them to her.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.300
Well, perhaps you could return them

16:42.330 --> 16:46.540
to the grocery store bucket
from whence they came.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.540
Well, how about this?

16:48.670 --> 16:50.580
Why don't I break your hip bone in two

16:50.600 --> 16:52.880
with my bare hands, you brittle bitch?

16:54.130 --> 16:56.540
- Try me, Chief.
- All right,

16:56.580 --> 16:58.630
that's enough, guys.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.680
I can actually hear George's heart.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.010
and I don't think it's the
right number of beats.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.079
George, go downstairs and wait.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.140
Uh, take the elevator.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.520
See you around... goober.

17:11.609 --> 17:15.230
Well, shouldn't you get back
to tending bar in The Shining?

17:16.319 --> 17:18.109
I thought we had something.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.410
I hope Tippy haunts your two-timing ass.

17:22.450 --> 17:23.530
Wow.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.450
What is he so wound up about?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.640
Maybe he thought you were into him,

17:27.660 --> 17:30.040
and then another guy shows
up to take you out?

17:30.170 --> 17:33.360
So I can't date two people?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.680
Since when have you become so judgy?

17:35.700 --> 17:38.050
We used to do that kind of
thing to guys all the time.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.380
Yeah, but this guy is my friend.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.190
And so am I,

17:42.220 --> 17:45.180
and I have known you longer than Hank.

17:45.310 --> 17:47.720
Boy, Shlubby Melons

17:47.750 --> 17:50.060
- has really changed you.
- Oh...

17:50.150 --> 17:51.420
It is Shady Meadows.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.220
You know damn well it
isn't Shlubby Melons.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.319
And you know what?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.070
I don't think you should move in here.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.119
- What? Why?
- Because our whole friendship

18:00.120 --> 18:02.570
has been you making a mess
and me cleaning it up.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.880
Oh, yeah? Well, here's
another mess for you.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.040
Well, I'm not gonna
clean it up this time.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.900
Yes, you're gonna clean it up, Margaret.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.710
God knows I don't want
to piss off Tippy.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.400
There you are.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.520
I just figured I'd put one more drink

18:32.540 --> 18:34.440
on your tab before I hit the highway.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.270
Okay, two drinks.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.420
Hey. Hey, I'm sor...

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
And some fruit.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.800
I'm sorry I got so upset back there.

18:46.890 --> 18:50.260
I guess you're right... Shady
Meadows has changed me.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.170
We had a lot of fun for a lot of years,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.620
but I just find the older I get,

18:55.640 --> 18:58.100
the more I want my chaos contained.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.100
It's okay. I mean, I-I get it.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.190
And I'm sorry that you always felt

19:02.220 --> 19:04.570
like you had to clean up my messes.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.150
Probably not a great idea

19:07.180 --> 19:08.900
for me to live here.

19:09.220 --> 19:12.240
It's not that I don't love you, Joanie,

19:12.370 --> 19:15.080
but I made three really good
friends when I moved in here,

19:15.100 --> 19:16.500
and I don't want to mess that up.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.710
Yeah, they're goofy. They're just...

19:18.790 --> 19:21.420
they're not very bright.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.920
But they're always there for me.

19:24.010 --> 19:27.250
Hey, why don't you buy a
place down in Phoenix?

19:27.280 --> 19:28.440
I'll come visit you,

19:28.470 --> 19:31.020
and I can have sex with
all of your friends?

19:31.060 --> 19:33.010
Oh, that sounds good.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.420
I'm not kidding.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.930
Will you sign the cast already?

19:43.960 --> 19:46.270
Just sign the friggin' cast.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.900
Okay. But it has to be perfect.

19:48.940 --> 19:51.230
Short, cute, funny. Like me.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.820
Okay, well, it's sign it
now or sign it never.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.530
I'm not gonna have this
thing on much longer.

19:55.650 --> 19:56.820
Fine.

19:56.910 --> 20:00.160
Get well soon.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.380
Love, Sid.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.120
Oh, my God. I'm a hack.

20:05.210 --> 20:07.790
And a heart over the eye. Really?

20:07.830 --> 20:10.670
Why didn't you just write,
"You look good plastered"?

20:13.550 --> 20:15.170
Damn it!

20:15.260 --> 20:17.600
Well, good news:

20:17.620 --> 20:19.970
the men of Shady Meadows are safe.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.720
I talked to Joanie. She's
not gonna move in.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.890
I'm really sorry she hurt you, buddy.

20:25.020 --> 20:27.170
Hurt me? Oh, she didn't hurt me.

20:27.230 --> 20:29.140
It's all part of the plan.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.520
Plan?

20:30.650 --> 20:32.060
Yeah, that's right.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.010
- The plan to get rid of her.
- Oh.

20:34.030 --> 20:35.700
See, I slept with her,

20:35.740 --> 20:38.440
then I acted all clingy
to push her away.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.660
But I couldn't tell you guys,

20:39.680 --> 20:41.520
'cause it was on a need-to-know basis.

20:42.910 --> 20:45.080
But the good news is
I'm not hurt at all.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.620
Matter of fact, I like coming
home to a empty apartment.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.080
Yeah, I do.

20:50.830 --> 20:53.140
Right. Well...

20:53.160 --> 20:55.550
gee, Hank, thank you
for doing that for us.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.260
I don't know what we
would do without you.

20:58.380 --> 21:01.050
I'm a little confused

21:01.080 --> 21:02.510
about some of the details.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.510
So, when you acted all into
Joanie, that wasn't real?

21:05.600 --> 21:08.020
No, that was all part of the plan.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.140
But I heard you crying in your room.

21:10.230 --> 21:12.400
How can that be part of the plan?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.980
Well, I knew you were outside listening,

21:15.070 --> 21:17.150
so...

21:17.240 --> 21:19.860
it was all... part of the plan.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.420
Then you teamed up with George.

21:23.500 --> 21:24.780
You hate each other.

21:24.870 --> 21:26.370
Plan.
