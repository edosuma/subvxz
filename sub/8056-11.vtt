WEBVTT

00:01.492 --> 00:02.723
Oh, goody, you're all here.

00:02.843 --> 00:05.579
Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk
about my campaign in the office,

00:05.699 --> 00:08.730
but last night I've made a decision
about who should be my campaign manager.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.667
This is a huge job.

00:10.685 --> 00:12.903
This is going to require
a lot of late night,

00:12.938 --> 00:14.855
one-on-one jam sessions
with me,

00:14.890 --> 00:16.373
and we're going to bounce ideas
off of each other,

00:16.408 --> 00:17.524
you're going to have to take
calls for me,

00:17.559 --> 00:19.310
any time, day or night.

00:19.344 --> 00:24.315
The person I have chosen is,
drum roll please,

00:28.420 --> 00:29.787
Ann Perkins! Yay!
Give it up for Ann!

00:29.821 --> 00:32.823
Good choice.

00:32.841 --> 00:34.825
Leslie, I don't know the first
thing about running

00:34.859 --> 00:36.860
a political campaign.

00:36.895 --> 00:38.829
Ann, you beautiful tropical fish.

00:38.847 --> 00:42.049
You're smart as a whip
and you're cool under pressure.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.268
You've resuscitated a human
heart in your bare hands.

00:44.302 --> 00:45.703
No, I haven't.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.271
- You haven't?
- No!

00:47.305 --> 00:49.306
You will.
You're that good of a nurse.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.557
What about Ben?

00:50.609 --> 00:52.526
I mean, he ran for mayor
at 18 and won.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.845
Ben is poison in my campaign.

00:54.863 --> 00:57.514
Our relationship is the reason
why my advisors pulled out.

00:57.549 --> 00:58.899
- I--
- Ann,

00:58.950 --> 01:00.851
don't listen to your head
or your heart.

01:00.885 --> 01:02.686
Just look at my eyes
and say "yes."

01:02.704 --> 01:04.354
- Okay, yes.
- Yes!

01:04.372 --> 01:06.189
- I believe in you, Ann.
- Thank you.

01:06.207 --> 01:07.875
And your first job
as my campaign manager

01:07.909 --> 01:09.660
is to start dressing like one.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.412
I don't want to have this
conversation again.

01:11.463 --> 01:14.197
Again? You just hired me eight
seconds ago.

01:14.215 --> 01:15.833
Wow. You're doing
a really bad job.

01:36.087 --> 01:39.573
- William, Elizabeth.
- Leslie, hi.

01:39.607 --> 01:42.259
Hi. What are you--
Are you coming to see me?

01:42.293 --> 01:44.128
Did you hear that I'm
relaunching my campaign?

01:44.162 --> 01:45.529
Actually, no, sorry.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.798
We weren't here to see you.
We've been meeting with

01:47.832 --> 01:49.566
other potential candidates
for city council.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.041
Yes, that's our job.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.777
I know.
Good luck, but, uh,

01:59.811 --> 02:02.112
I just had a big meeting
with my new advisory board,

02:02.147 --> 02:04.948
and they're brilliant and amazing.

02:04.983 --> 02:06.750
They're real killers.

02:06.785 --> 02:09.303
Leslie, I tried to make
ramen in the coffee pot

02:09.354 --> 02:10.971
and I broke everything.

02:11.021 --> 02:13.023
Thank you, Andy.
I'll be right in.

02:13.058 --> 02:15.476
Well, uh, good luck,
Leslie. Honestly.

02:15.527 --> 02:18.762
Well, we don't need luck.
We are a rocket ship.

02:18.797 --> 02:21.131
We are relaunching,
and we're going to blast past

02:21.166 --> 02:23.367
your cann--
Huh, they're gone.

02:23.401 --> 02:26.370
It's true--I no longer have
highly-trained,

02:26.404 --> 02:29.373
professional campaign managers.
So what?

02:29.407 --> 02:31.909
Are most murders committed by
highly-trained,

02:31.943 --> 02:33.961
professional assassins?
No.

02:33.995 --> 02:37.981
They're committed by friends
and coworkers.

02:38.016 --> 02:40.017
That analogy was way better
in my head.

02:45.507 --> 02:47.424
Hi.

02:47.459 --> 02:52.346
Champion? Oh my gosh,
there you are, puppy.

02:52.397 --> 02:55.365
- That's a good boy.
- That is a three-legged dog.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.153
His name is Champion, because
he's the dog world champion.

02:59.187 --> 03:00.804
Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry,

03:00.839 --> 03:03.306
but how many legs did that dog
have when you found him?

03:03.324 --> 03:04.975
Three! That's what
makes him the best.

03:05.009 --> 03:07.861
He can do more with three legs
than most dogs can do with four.

03:07.912 --> 03:10.030
Except for digging.
He's really bad at digging.

03:10.081 --> 03:11.198
And you remember what you said

03:11.249 --> 03:12.533
about making decisions in the house?

03:12.584 --> 03:15.586
You want to be involved.
We get that, so...

03:15.620 --> 03:16.987
You just say the word,

03:17.005 --> 03:18.789
and Champion goes back to the pound,

03:18.823 --> 03:20.958
where he can be put down
and killed forever.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.343
I'm not gonna send
a three-legged dog to his death.

03:23.378 --> 03:24.695
Yes!

03:24.729 --> 03:26.630
But I'm not gonna
take care of him for you.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.183
Well, it would be nice
if you helped a little.

03:29.217 --> 03:31.668
Because, unlike you,
Andy and I have jobs.

03:31.686 --> 03:34.538
Cruel, but fair.

03:34.572 --> 03:37.941
So Leslie and I have
come up with the theme

03:37.976 --> 03:40.144
for the campaign relaunch rally.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.945
"The Comeback Kid."

03:41.980 --> 03:44.398
Everyone loves
a good comeback story. <i>Rocky.</i>

03:44.449 --> 03:45.699
Robert Downey, Jr.

03:45.733 --> 03:48.702
Terminator said,
"I'll be back," and he was.

03:48.736 --> 03:51.955
Also making a comeback--
the casual Hawaiian shirt.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.241
Well, well, well,
look, who's ahead of the curve.

03:54.292 --> 03:55.542
I was joking.

03:55.577 --> 03:58.045
You should soak that
in bleach and burn it.

03:58.079 --> 03:59.880
Okay, so, the rally's
going to be held tomorrow

03:59.914 --> 04:01.465
at the Pawnee Sports Building.

04:01.499 --> 04:03.584
April, you finalized a rental, right?

04:03.635 --> 04:05.002
Shut up, Ann.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.770
I told you never to talk to me.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.422
That was Champion.

04:08.473 --> 04:10.140
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
Bad dog!

04:10.175 --> 04:11.809
Yes, everything's fine
with the rental.

04:11.843 --> 04:13.443
Ron, you're constructing the stage?

04:13.478 --> 04:14.928
Yes, ma'am.

04:14.979 --> 04:19.315
Leslie wanted to hire
a contractor to build a stage.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.051
I don't want to paint
with a broad brush here,

04:21.084 --> 04:24.054
but every single contractor
in the world

04:24.088 --> 04:27.090
is a miserable, incompetent thief.

04:27.125 --> 04:33.030
Seal the edges by crimping
the fork--aw, crap.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.464
Ben!

04:34.499 --> 04:35.866
What's up, Chris?
Come on in, man.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.401
I already did.

04:37.435 --> 04:39.036
So, uh, how you been?
How are you doing?

04:39.070 --> 04:40.838
- How are you?
- Great, actually.

04:40.872 --> 04:45.142
I'm just learning how to
make a "cali-zoin-za."

04:45.176 --> 04:48.312
Or, as you Americans
like to say, calzones.

04:48.346 --> 04:52.216
- Do you want one?
- No, I find <i>calzone</i> fatty,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.584
and unnecessary.

04:53.618 --> 04:55.519
So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch,

04:55.553 --> 04:57.254
and I care about you,

04:57.288 --> 04:59.790
so I just want to make sure
you're doing okay.

04:59.824 --> 05:02.759
Chris, honestly, I'm great.

05:02.794 --> 05:06.563
I'm just exploring whatever fun
activity pops into my brain.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.898
Like, check this out.

05:07.932 --> 05:12.686
I'm teaching myself how to do
Claymation videos.

05:12.737 --> 05:14.905
Isn't this just so cool?

05:14.939 --> 05:16.206
It is so cool!

05:16.241 --> 05:19.877
Ben is massively depressed,
and he needs my help.

05:19.911 --> 05:21.645
You look like a real campaign manager.

05:21.663 --> 05:24.814
Oh, thanks, that's because
I googled "campaign manager"

05:24.832 --> 05:27.417
and noticed that they wear
a lot of dark colors.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.852
See, there's more things
to look at on the Internet

05:28.887 --> 05:32.089
- besides naked guys, Ann.
- What?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.391
I need a team update,
campaign manager.

05:34.425 --> 05:38.161
Okay. Pistol Pete Disellio
will be here in five minutes.

05:38.196 --> 05:39.696
I still can't believe
that you got him.

05:39.731 --> 05:42.165
Ann got local hero Pistol
Pete Disellio

05:42.200 --> 05:43.867
to endorse me at the rally.

05:43.902 --> 05:46.470
In 1992, Pistol Pete's
last-second dunk

05:46.504 --> 05:49.556
against Eagleton High clinched
a comeback victory

05:49.607 --> 05:52.075
for the Pawnee Central
drunken savages.

05:52.110 --> 05:54.578
Team mascot later changed.

05:54.612 --> 05:57.847
Akash, buddy, of course
I came to you first.

05:57.865 --> 05:59.650
You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.

05:59.684 --> 06:01.118
But here's my question--

06:01.152 --> 06:03.153
Do your carpets match your drapes?

06:05.957 --> 06:07.374
How do you make any event classy
on a budget?

06:07.408 --> 06:09.059
Red carpet.

06:09.093 --> 06:10.827
My entire apartment is red carpet.

06:10.862 --> 06:13.497
On top of that,
leading into my bedroom,

06:13.531 --> 06:14.798
a second red carpet.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.135
Oh, what's this in my shoe?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.720
Red carpet insole.

06:19.754 --> 06:23.440
Everywhere I go,
I'm walking on red carpet.

06:25.209 --> 06:27.077
Is there even enough room
for everyone?

06:27.111 --> 06:28.762
- Here, sit on my lap.
- No, that's humiliating.

06:28.813 --> 06:30.213
Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?

06:30.231 --> 06:31.932
No, that's Champion's spot.
He called it.

06:31.983 --> 06:33.817
Tom, we're already late.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.986
Now, be a man, and sit
on that girl's lap.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.188
Yes, sir.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.426
Hi, Pete Disellio.

06:42.460 --> 06:43.610
We can call you Pistol, right?

06:43.661 --> 06:44.945
I prefer Pete.

06:44.996 --> 06:47.230
Oh. Okay, got it.
I'm Leslie Knope.

06:47.248 --> 06:49.132
We overlapped a year
at Pawnee Central.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.334
You probably remember my voice

06:50.368 --> 06:51.535
from the morning announcements.

06:51.569 --> 06:53.370
This is my campaign manager,
Ann Perkins.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.255
Hi, nice to meet you.
Come on in.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.140
Oh, thanks.

06:57.175 --> 07:00.043
- I'm excited to be here.
- Ah! We're excited to have you.

07:00.078 --> 07:03.597
Ann is killing it.
My campaign team is unstoppable.

07:03.631 --> 07:05.966
This rally is going to be awesome.

07:06.017 --> 07:07.768
Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!

07:07.802 --> 07:12.472
I'm gonna break dance!

07:12.523 --> 07:13.590
Leslie?

07:13.608 --> 07:15.609
Coming! Thank God.

07:20.804 --> 07:23.223
Oh, Champion is a way better
kisser than you are, babe.

07:23.258 --> 07:24.058
- Nuh-uh!
- Yes, he is.

07:24.059 --> 07:27.349
He's even a better kisser
than me. Here, try some.

07:27.469 --> 07:29.680
Okay, stop it.
He's drooling on me!

07:33.351 --> 07:34.485
Oh, we should do it for the kids.

07:34.519 --> 07:36.236
Kids love it, Ron.
Just for the kids.

07:37.271 --> 07:40.024
Hi, kids! Hey!

07:40.575 --> 07:40.908
Oh, look.

07:40.943 --> 07:43.344
The police even love it.
They're sirening back to us.

07:43.978 --> 07:46.312
That's awesome, I was going to 
tell them that we heard them.

07:46.313 --> 07:47.949
Heard ya, bud!

07:48.750 --> 07:51.836
And then, you come out,
and you dunk the ball,

07:51.887 --> 07:55.222
and you say, "Voting for Leslie
Knope is a slam dunk!"

07:55.257 --> 07:56.357
You can still dunk, right?

07:56.391 --> 08:00.227
- Oh, I can, but I won't.
- Sorry?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.428
Look, everywhere I go,

08:01.463 --> 08:02.963
everybody wants me to
talk about that dunk,

08:02.981 --> 08:04.131
and that game.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.399
It feels like I'm living in the past.

08:05.433 --> 08:09.320
But the past is great.
The jitterbug, stagecoaches,

08:09.354 --> 08:10.504
Herman Munster.

08:10.539 --> 08:12.072
Look, Leslie, I read up on you.

08:12.107 --> 08:13.674
You've done great stuff
for our parks system

08:13.708 --> 08:15.876
and I will happily endorse you...

08:15.911 --> 08:17.511
As Peter Disellio,

08:17.546 --> 08:19.246
regional distributor
for Derwin ham loafs,

08:19.281 --> 08:22.750
but if this is about who I was,
or what I did when I was 17,

08:22.784 --> 08:24.552
I'm out of here.

08:24.586 --> 08:26.337
Let's not talk about dunking anymore.

08:26.371 --> 08:27.487
Let's talk about what you want to do.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.256
- Okay.
- I think you want to dunk.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.724
I'm not going to dunk the ball.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.927
What about a layup?

08:32.961 --> 08:35.346
Officer, I've been operating
heavy machinery

08:35.380 --> 08:37.765
since I was eight years old.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.717
Now, I respect you
and your service to this town

08:40.769 --> 08:41.902
and your country,

08:41.937 --> 08:45.606
but what laws are we breaking exactly?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.541
Well, you got four people
in the front seat,

08:47.576 --> 08:49.376
nobody's wearing a seat belt,

08:49.411 --> 08:50.895
you were speeding
and blasting your horn

08:50.946 --> 08:52.379
through the hospital zone,

08:52.414 --> 08:55.566
the rear of the vehicle's open,
debris has been falling out,

08:55.617 --> 08:57.751
and you don't have a commercial
license to drive a truck.

08:57.786 --> 09:01.322
Okay. Well, we have
a philosophical difference

09:01.356 --> 09:03.574
on what constitutes a law.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.858
I need to see your hands

09:04.876 --> 09:07.027
and could you step out of
the vehicle, please?

09:07.045 --> 09:10.548
Hi. I just wanted you to know
we're about to be arrested.

09:10.582 --> 09:12.099
Oh my God, April, that's horrible.

09:12.133 --> 09:13.751
Where are you?

09:13.802 --> 09:15.553
"My mother's butt", really?
That's really helpful.

09:15.587 --> 09:16.971
Let me talk to her.

09:17.005 --> 09:19.807
April, this is city council
candidate Leslie Knope.

09:19.841 --> 09:21.208
Do not make any trouble.

09:21.226 --> 09:24.395
Sit tight.
I'm on my way.

09:24.429 --> 09:26.230
- Whoa. You just hung up on her?
- She'd already hung up on me.

09:26.264 --> 09:28.082
Okay, I'm going to go down
there and get them out,

09:28.116 --> 09:29.617
because men in uniform love me.

09:29.651 --> 09:32.253
You have to get Pistol Pete
to make that shot.

09:32.287 --> 09:34.021
Okay, but if I don't,
it's no big deal, right?

09:34.055 --> 09:36.357
- You'll just make your speech?
- He's our surprise headliner.

09:36.391 --> 09:38.392
The whole town loves him.
I'm polling at 1%.

09:38.426 --> 09:40.244
He must dunk, Ann.

09:40.278 --> 09:41.946
Do whatever it takes.

09:41.997 --> 09:43.563
You know, anything short
of sexual favors.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.032
- What?
- I do not--

09:45.066 --> 09:46.667
I repeat, I do not

09:46.701 --> 09:48.636
want you to tempt him
with sexual favors.

09:48.670 --> 09:50.137
- I wasn't going to.
- Good, I wouldn't either.

09:50.171 --> 09:51.205
That's where I draw the line.

09:51.239 --> 09:52.373
Although, I am a little offended

09:52.374 --> 09:53.357
that you wouldn't do that for me.

09:53.358 --> 09:54.692
- Go.
- Right.

09:54.943 --> 09:59.546
- So, Ben...Why <i>Calzone?</i>
<i>- Glad you asked, Chris.</i>

09:59.580 --> 10:01.915
You know, there's fast food
hamburgers.

10:01.933 --> 10:03.083
There's fast food Mexican.

10:03.101 --> 10:04.584
There's fast food Chinese.
Blah blah blah.

10:04.603 --> 10:06.020
Have you ever wondered

10:06.054 --> 10:08.355
why there isn't a fast food
option for Italian food?

10:08.390 --> 10:09.723
What about pizza?

10:09.757 --> 10:12.259
Pizza?
Never heard of it.

10:12.277 --> 10:14.028
That's what people will be
saying in 20 years,

10:14.062 --> 10:16.430
because pizza is old news, Chris.

10:16.448 --> 10:19.316
Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.

10:19.367 --> 10:20.818
Never thought of it that way.

10:20.869 --> 10:22.620
What I'm talking about is
a portable, delicious meal,

10:22.654 --> 10:24.038
that is it's own container.

10:24.072 --> 10:27.174
It's a whole new spin
on Italian fast casual dining.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.043
Amazing.

10:29.077 --> 10:31.412
And you of all people will like this.

10:31.446 --> 10:32.413
I'm gonna use
low-fat ingredients.

10:32.447 --> 10:33.714
Game-changer.

10:33.748 --> 10:36.750
And I will call my new
Italian fast casual eatery

10:36.784 --> 10:41.338
"The Low-cal Calzone Zone."

10:41.389 --> 10:44.425
That idea is literally
the greatest idea

10:44.459 --> 10:45.492
I've ever heard in my life.

10:45.527 --> 10:47.661
That idea is terrible.

10:47.696 --> 10:49.463
Glen, you're killing me.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.598
They broke about 50 laws, Knope.

10:51.632 --> 10:54.268
And that girl, she tried to get
that gimp dog to bite me.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.637
Look, I could sit here
and fill out all the paperwork,

10:57.656 --> 11:00.140
but you and I both know that
you'd rather go home to Debra,

11:00.175 --> 11:02.809
have a nice home-cooked meal,
and do what comes naturally.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.111
That's not appropriate.

11:04.145 --> 11:06.280
You know that I'm gonna
pay all the fines.

11:06.314 --> 11:10.534
I'm in the middle of a campaign
rally, and this is my team.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.536
- I need them, please.
- Fine.

11:12.587 --> 11:14.388
But unless one of you
has a commercial license,

11:14.422 --> 11:17.324
you can't take that truck.

11:17.359 --> 11:20.210
It would just mean so much to us.

11:20.261 --> 11:22.296
I mean, you're a living legend.

11:22.330 --> 11:25.399
They still air that game every
Friday night on cable access.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.734
Yeah, well, being a living legend is

11:26.768 --> 11:28.185
sort of a double-edged sword.

11:28.219 --> 11:30.070
Everybody in this town
still calls me "Pistol."

11:30.105 --> 11:33.057
Tell me more about that, Peter.

11:33.108 --> 11:36.393
I mean, yes, that dunk,
it made me famous,

11:36.444 --> 11:39.813
but sometimes...

11:39.847 --> 11:43.784
Sometimes life dunks you.

11:43.818 --> 11:45.852
Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?

11:45.870 --> 11:47.654
Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs,

11:47.688 --> 11:49.540
get some endorphins going?

11:49.574 --> 11:51.208
Oh, no, thanks, Chris.

11:51.242 --> 11:53.260
Kind of tearing this Claymation video

11:53.294 --> 11:55.028
a new one right now.

11:55.063 --> 11:56.663
You know, Ben, I really think

11:56.697 --> 11:58.082
you need to take a step back here.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.033
I think getting some
perspective would be good.

12:00.051 --> 12:01.568
What are you talking about?

12:01.603 --> 12:02.970
I've known you a long time.

12:03.004 --> 12:07.374
And, right now, you need help.

12:07.409 --> 12:10.210
- With my Claymaish?
- With your life.

12:10.228 --> 12:14.481
You are wildly, insanely depressed.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.916
Depressed?

12:15.950 --> 12:17.651
I'm the furthest thing from depressed.

12:17.685 --> 12:19.553
I mean, look at what
I've accomplished.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.000
Do you see him?

12:21.001 --> 12:24.090
Do you think a depressed
person could make this?

12:24.091 --> 12:24.944
No.

12:26.995 --> 12:29.229
- That's all we can fit in here.
- No problem.

12:29.247 --> 12:31.165
This is going to be fine.
We're all going to be fine,

12:31.199 --> 12:32.566
because the team is still together,

12:32.584 --> 12:34.334
and there's nothing the team can't do.

12:34.369 --> 12:37.671
Wait, I think Champion
has to go to the bathroom.

12:37.705 --> 12:41.275
- Oh! He shall do it in the car!
- Answer your phone, Ann.

12:41.309 --> 12:42.776
That's what life is like

12:42.811 --> 12:44.945
in a strict Roman Catholic household.

12:44.979 --> 12:46.547
Of course, my father,

12:46.581 --> 12:47.631
he was more stick than carrot

12:47.682 --> 12:49.349
when it came to matters of discipline.

12:49.384 --> 12:52.553
I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt
that I know,

12:52.587 --> 12:55.155
I just don't think he'd be
happy sitting here

12:55.190 --> 12:56.774
faffing around.

12:56.808 --> 12:58.108
I'm not faffing around.

12:58.143 --> 12:59.943
I've sunk myself into my hobbies.

12:59.978 --> 13:03.530
Here, I'll show you my
Claymation project, okay?

13:03.565 --> 13:05.666
Now, I've been working
pretty hard on this,

13:05.700 --> 13:08.368
and...I think
it's really good.

13:08.403 --> 13:10.704
So just hang on to your hat, okay?

13:10.738 --> 13:12.623
Here it goes.

13:14.626 --> 13:16.276
Oh, how great.

13:21.483 --> 13:23.817
♪ Stand in the place
where you-- ♪

13:27.489 --> 13:31.725
- Did you pause it?
- No, I--hang on.

13:33.761 --> 13:36.096
♪ Stand in the place
where you-- ♪

13:41.536 --> 13:45.405
Oh, my God.
That's the whole thing.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.875
- That's three weeks of work.
- You're gonna be okay.

13:47.909 --> 13:51.445
No, no, no, no, I'm not.
You see, in my head,

13:51.479 --> 13:54.081
I thought that was really,
really cool.

13:54.115 --> 13:56.683
I emailed Leslie two days ago

13:56.718 --> 13:58.886
and I compared it to <i>Avatar,</i>

13:58.920 --> 14:01.288
Chris, and how can it not be longer?

14:01.322 --> 14:04.091
Okay, look, what you're
feeling, right now

14:04.125 --> 14:06.760
is regret and shame.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.760
But we are going 
to get through this.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.964
Okay, no word from Ann.

14:10.999 --> 14:12.516
April, I need a status report.

14:12.550 --> 14:15.435
- How's it looking out there?
- Perfect, but just one thing.

14:15.470 --> 14:17.037
It's not a basketball court any more.

14:17.071 --> 14:18.388
It's an ice skating rink.

14:18.439 --> 14:19.940
Wait, what? Why?
What happened?

14:19.974 --> 14:22.109
The stupid guy I called to
book this place didn't tell me

14:22.143 --> 14:24.144
they took off the basketball
floor for a hockey game.

14:24.178 --> 14:26.480
Or maybe he did tell me,
but he was so stupid and boring

14:26.514 --> 14:27.698
that I wasn't listening,

14:27.732 --> 14:28.849
and either way, it was his fault,

14:28.883 --> 14:30.651
because he was stupid and I hated him.

14:30.685 --> 14:32.085
Ron, how's the stage coming?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.822
Well, since we had to
jettison the bulk of the wood,

14:35.856 --> 14:37.124
this is the biggest I could make it.

14:37.158 --> 14:38.692
Oh, my God.

14:38.726 --> 14:41.828
Good lord, what happened
to the rest of my face?

14:41.862 --> 14:43.530
We had to "Jetsons"
most of the poster too,

14:43.548 --> 14:44.748
but I kind of like it,

14:44.799 --> 14:48.302
'cause windows
are the eyes to the house.

14:48.336 --> 14:49.970
Wow.

14:50.004 --> 14:52.839
- Okay, I got Pistol Pete.
- Good, where is he?

14:52.873 --> 14:54.841
Right now, he's curled up
in the back seat of my car,

14:54.875 --> 14:57.778
talking about his father,
who is a piece of work.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.813
I actually think he did the best
he could for a single father,

14:59.847 --> 15:01.515
but I may be too close
to the situation.

15:01.549 --> 15:03.267
Anyway, the important news
is that he's here.

15:03.318 --> 15:04.818
Good. Is he going to
dunk for me?

15:04.852 --> 15:07.187
I'm not sure, I couldn't
hear through all the crying.

15:07.221 --> 15:08.888
- He's crying?
- No, I was crying.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.157
It's been a stressful day,

15:10.191 --> 15:11.358
and he's had a really rough life.

15:11.392 --> 15:12.793
Oh, my God.

15:12.827 --> 15:14.027
We should cancel it, right?
Maybe we should cancel it?

15:14.062 --> 15:15.262
- Yeah.
- Jerry...

15:15.296 --> 15:16.780
You were in charge of getting a crowd.

15:16.831 --> 15:18.365
Please tell me that you pulled
a Jerry, and no one's here.

15:18.399 --> 15:19.700
Okay, well, first of all,

15:19.734 --> 15:21.168
I don't like it when you guys
use that term.

15:21.202 --> 15:23.370
But for the record, I came through.

15:23.404 --> 15:25.739
There are almost
a hundred people out there!

15:25.757 --> 15:28.625
Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just
had to do your job, didn't you?

15:28.676 --> 15:30.577
Yeah, can't you do anything
wrong, Jerry?

15:30.612 --> 15:32.579
I've been looking
at our utter and complete lack

15:32.597 --> 15:34.932
of experience as a positive thing,

15:34.966 --> 15:36.433
but I'm starting to think

15:36.467 --> 15:38.551
it might actually be a problem.

15:40.613 --> 15:41.984
Okay, guys, everybody listen up.

15:42.104 --> 15:43.780
I just wanted to say thank you.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.428
You've all volunteered
your time and, no matter what,

15:46.462 --> 15:48.263
I am eternally grateful for it.

15:48.297 --> 15:49.431
Now, I'm going to go out there,

15:49.465 --> 15:51.266
and I'm going to
announce the relaunch,

15:51.300 --> 15:53.868
and I'm going to muddle through
this thing as best I can.

15:53.903 --> 15:56.070
You should all leave,
and when this thing is over,

15:56.105 --> 15:57.405
I'll meet you at the nearest bar.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.374
That would be Hurley's.

15:59.408 --> 16:00.725
- Oh, it's karaoke tonight!
- Yes!

16:00.760 --> 16:04.129
No, no, no, guys.
No. We're not leaving, okay?

16:04.163 --> 16:06.513
We're the reason
Leslie's in this mess.

16:06.514 --> 16:08.996
It's our mess.
We're going to stay here

16:08.997 --> 16:11.352
and we're going to
go out there as a team.

16:11.353 --> 16:15.507
Or, we go as a team to Hurley's.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.292
No, Ann's right.

16:17.326 --> 16:20.562
We're a team.
We're all going out together.

16:20.596 --> 16:21.729
Let's give this crowd a show.

16:21.764 --> 16:24.349
Go, team!

16:28.437 --> 16:32.173
♪ Get up and make it happen ♪

16:32.191 --> 16:34.509

16:35.528 --> 16:37.045
Tom?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.530
I couldn't afford 
enough premium carpet

16:38.564 --> 16:40.014
to get us to the stage.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.149
I mean, it was a short walk,

16:41.183 --> 16:42.817
but it was pretty luxurious, right?

16:42.851 --> 16:44.852
Okay.

16:51.843 --> 16:53.077
Everybody smile and wave.

16:56.081 --> 17:00.468

17:00.503 --> 17:02.704

17:10.479 --> 17:12.012
I'm holding the dog.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.098
He is peeing.
He is now peeing.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.883
I am putting him down.

17:15.901 --> 17:17.652
No, Ron, he only has three legs!

17:19.054 --> 17:21.623
- Get off me!
- No, I'm scared!

17:21.656 --> 17:23.491
♪ Get up and make it happen ♪

17:23.526 --> 17:26.094
Ron? Ron?
There's no stairs.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.728

17:50.652 --> 17:52.620
Okay.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.398
Mm-mm.
Here you go. Drink up,

18:03.432 --> 18:06.267
because it has every herb
in my herb belt.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.703
Oh. Tastes like a belt.

18:08.737 --> 18:11.906
I know, isn't it awful?
But it works wonderfully.

18:11.940 --> 18:13.491
So, tell me.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.177
Do you admit that you're depressed?

18:16.211 --> 18:18.146
How did you know?
I didn't even know.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.381
The Letters to Cleo t-shirt,
the unshaven face,

18:20.416 --> 18:23.284
the Doc Martins, and your hair
does not have that normal,

18:23.302 --> 18:27.121
uptight, rigid, inflexible
Ben Wyatt sense of fun.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.658
You can't hide
these things from friends.

18:30.693 --> 18:33.361
I think I'm feeling better.

18:33.395 --> 18:35.897
Herbal smoothie,
you have done it again.

18:35.931 --> 18:39.601
As a loyal pawneean, I've
always been proud of this town,

18:39.635 --> 18:41.669
and, I, oh, um, sorry.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.572
My cards got out of order here
when they fell.

18:44.607 --> 18:51.245
Together, we can defeat
obese children.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.365
I'm sure that was something
positive, originally.

18:54.416 --> 18:57.919
I'm sorry, okay, this is
just a disaster, isn't it?

18:57.953 --> 19:02.991
This is the worst political
event ever in history.

19:03.025 --> 19:07.328
Well, um, I can assure
you people in the bleachers

19:07.363 --> 19:10.431
that, if you follow my campaign,
it will be interesting.

19:10.466 --> 19:12.050
It sure will be!

19:12.101 --> 19:13.635
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete,

19:13.669 --> 19:16.003
and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend!

19:18.724 --> 19:21.859
I just wanted to say that
I fully endorse Leslie Knope.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.844
She's got a great team behind her,

19:23.862 --> 19:27.048
and a vote for her is a slam dunk.

19:29.368 --> 19:30.918
Thanks, Pistol Pete!

19:30.953 --> 19:33.454
Wow, we're so happy to have you.

19:33.489 --> 19:36.124
Oh, hey. There he goes.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.125
Come on, Pete!

19:37.159 --> 19:38.543
Oh!

19:38.577 --> 19:41.245
Okay, stay still.
Stay down.

19:41.296 --> 19:44.732
Pistol Pete, everybody.
Still got it.

19:47.418 --> 19:50.204
- Hey.
- Hey, how was the rally?

19:50.239 --> 19:52.106
- Oh, we nailed it!
- No, we didn't.

19:52.141 --> 19:54.776
Ben, my campaign manager
and I have made a decision.

19:54.810 --> 19:57.879
We've decided to fire
the campaign manager--me.

19:57.913 --> 20:01.582
- And hire you.
- But we've talked about this.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.018
I don't care if you're
poison to my campaign.

20:04.053 --> 20:07.722
This team has a lot of heart
and zero know-how.

20:07.756 --> 20:09.490
You're the only one that can save us.

20:09.525 --> 20:12.326
Please be my campaign manager.

20:12.361 --> 20:14.762
You know, Leslie, Ben's really
been going through something,

20:14.797 --> 20:17.765
and he's on a journey, so I
don't think he's gonna be--

20:17.800 --> 20:19.434
I'll do it. I'm in.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.003
I've done enough exploring.
I'm good.

20:22.037 --> 20:23.404
- Okay, great.
- Ann, you're fired.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.073
Oh, thank God.

20:26.091 --> 20:29.354
No, don't make out.
It's making Champion sad.

20:30.977 --> 20:33.110
Surprise!

20:33.350 --> 20:36.486
We felt really bad about
the whole dredging up your past

20:36.520 --> 20:38.822
just to be publically
humiliated thing.

20:38.856 --> 20:41.825
- So, cookies.
- And balloons.

20:41.859 --> 20:44.894
Thanks, guys. It--
that's nice.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.162
We feel so bad.

20:46.197 --> 20:48.631
Is there anything else we can do?

20:48.666 --> 20:50.266
You could let me take you to dinner.

20:50.301 --> 20:52.135
Yes, Ann, yes.
You should do that.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.170
Oh, I can't, though,
because I'm married.

20:54.205 --> 20:56.790
You're not married.
She's not married.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.010
This is uncomfortable.
