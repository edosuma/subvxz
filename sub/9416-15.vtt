WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:04.041
Good morning, everybody.

00:04.125 --> 00:05.125
Oh, Teddy, there you are.

00:05.208 --> 00:06.417
Look, I am slammed today,

00:06.500 --> 00:08.041
so I need you to watch
the kids after school.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.834
Oh, Mom, I can't.
I have to go to the mall.

00:09.917 --> 00:12.125
Ah, ah, ah, ah-- Just stop right there.

00:12.208 --> 00:15.750
For once, can't we just skip
this little dance we always do?

00:15.834 --> 00:17.542
- What dance?
- You know, the dance

00:17.625 --> 00:19.542
where I ask you to watch
the kids and you say no.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.834
Then I ask the boys and they say

00:20.917 --> 00:22.709
they're not responsible or not smart.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.792
Then I ask your dad
and he pretends not to be listening.

00:28.208 --> 00:29.834
And then we're back to you.

00:29.917 --> 00:32.333
I really need new shoes.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.333
- Boys?
- I’m not responsible.

00:34.417 --> 00:35.583
Me not smart.

00:36.917 --> 00:37.834
Bob?

00:37.917 --> 00:39.625
I’m sorry, what?

00:42.875 --> 00:44.208
And we're back to you.

00:44.291 --> 00:47.500
Fine, I’ll go to the mall
and then I’ll just come home afterwards.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.583
What do we at this point in the dance?

00:49.667 --> 00:51.667
Oh, you leave, call Ivy,

00:51.750 --> 00:52.792
and complain about Mom.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.125
You stay and complain about Teddy.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.250
- Sounds good.
- Works for me.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.875
Ivy, you will not believe
what just happened.

01:04.250 --> 01:06.250

Hey, good news, Dad.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.667
This really cute girl in my cooking class
is kind of into me.

02:08.750 --> 02:09.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:09.959 --> 02:11.250
There's definitely been some sparks.

02:11.333 --> 02:14.750
And I’m not just talking about the trouble
I had with my flambe.

02:14.834 --> 02:15.959
Good for you, PJ.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.208
Yeah, she's coming over tomorrow,

02:17.250 --> 02:18.750
and we're gonna cook...

02:19.125 --> 02:20.375
If you know what I mean.

02:20.458 --> 02:23.375
Ooh, going to get a little romantic, huh?

02:23.458 --> 02:24.834
No, we're gonna make chicken.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.667
And when we're done,

02:28.750 --> 02:31.041
it'll be time for dessert...

02:31.125 --> 02:32.834
If you know what I mean.

02:34.041 --> 02:36.125
I’m just gonna say I know what you mean.

02:38.417 --> 02:39.959
Anyway, when she comes over,

02:40.041 --> 02:42.250
can you not be here?

02:43.875 --> 02:45.834
Why can't you just take her to your place?

02:45.917 --> 02:47.917
No, no, no, no-- see, the plan is,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.917
make sure she's into me,
then show her the apartment.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.208
If she's still in after that,

02:52.250 --> 02:53.417
then she meets Emmett.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.709
If she's still in after that...

02:55.792 --> 02:56.875
Well, that's never happened.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.667
What are you doing?

03:14.750 --> 03:17.667
Why are you reading?

03:17.750 --> 03:20.500
You know you'd rather be watching tv.

03:20.583 --> 03:21.792
Can I--

03:21.875 --> 03:23.083
Ooh.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.250
Hey, Jake, big problem.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.709
Something's come back
to bite us in the butt.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.625
Hey, Ivy. I got the shoes.

03:41.709 --> 03:42.834
They're gorgeous.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.041
Well, yeah, of course
they're uncomfortable.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.917
I said they're gorgeous.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.041
Unbelievable.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.041
My mom said she had such a busy day,

03:53.125 --> 03:55.166
and now she's at the food court.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.709
Hold-- I’ll call you back.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.417
Well, fancy seeing you here.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.917
Pardon me?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.834
What's with this ridiculous hat?

04:03.917 --> 04:05.417
Aunt Jamie?

04:05.500 --> 04:07.208
- Teddy?
- Hi.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.458
Hi.

04:08.542 --> 04:11.166
Oh, I’m so sorry.
I thought you were my mom.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.625
Yeah, I get that a lot.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.000
So what are you doing in town?

04:16.083 --> 04:17.375
Oh, I’m here on business.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.875
Why didn't you call us?

04:18.959 --> 04:23.208
Well, Teddy, you know your mother and I
aren't exactly on speaking terms.

04:23.458 --> 04:24.792
Oh.

04:25.709 --> 04:27.166
How's the rest of the family?

04:27.250 --> 04:28.667
Oh, uh, good.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.500
Yeah, Toby is getting so cute.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.500
Aww.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.875
Who's Toby?

04:33.458 --> 04:35.458
Oh, uh, I guess you didn't know.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.250
Mom and dad had another one after Charlie.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.667
Oh.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.083
Who's Charlie?

04:42.375 --> 04:44.750
Does the name Gabe ring a bell?

04:45.583 --> 04:46.917
Yes. Yes.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.834
That's why I thought
they would have stopped.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.333
So you're really not gonna tell my mom
that you're in town?

04:54.375 --> 04:55.834
No! No, no, no, no, no.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.709
Please, please, please
don't say you saw me.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.625
I just don't want to cause a fuss.

05:01.709 --> 05:05.041
Wow, it's hard to believe
you're my mom's younger sister.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.625
You guys are so different.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.625
server: Jamie, your order is ready. Jamie.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.041
Oh, I hate it when they do that.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.125
It draws attention to me.

05:17.208 --> 05:18.542
So different.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.000
So what's the big problem, dude?

05:27.083 --> 05:28.625
This ad for hank's market.

05:28.709 --> 05:29.917
Look.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.375
Creamed corn, 99 cents?

05:32.458 --> 05:33.709
They call that a sale?

05:35.375 --> 05:36.709
I’m talking about the baby.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.375
Don't you remember what we did last month?

05:42.750 --> 05:44.875
Oh, monster truck rally.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.667
Hey, we've got to go to that.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.166
Tickets are 30 bucks each.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.166
Where are we gonna get that kind of money?

05:52.542 --> 05:54.583
Maybe he can help us.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.667
That baby's got 60 bucks?

05:56.750 --> 05:59.250
Dude, you are blowing my mind.

06:02.417 --> 06:05.250
The only thing that surprises
me about that comment

06:05.333 --> 06:07.250
is that you got the math right.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.875
Anyway, this one time
when me and my brother

06:11.959 --> 06:12.834
needed some money,

06:12.917 --> 06:15.250
we did something kind of...

06:15.333 --> 06:16.709
interesting.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.041
Great news, Mom.

06:20.125 --> 06:21.417
I like Charlie now.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
Well, finally. What happened?

06:23.583 --> 06:24.792
We were in the park,

06:24.875 --> 06:27.792
and this photographer thought that
Charlie was like the cutest baby ever.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.250
- Wow.
- He offered to pay her 100 bucks

06:29.375 --> 06:30.625
to use her as a model.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.583
Forget it. I’m not exploiting my baby.

06:33.709 --> 06:36.208
I knew we should have done it my way.

06:36.291 --> 06:37.417
What was your way?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.208
We don't tell mom
we're doing the photo shoot,

06:39.291 --> 06:41.875
and we go ahead and do it anyway
and split the money.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.250
Boy, that's confusing.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.709
We were remembering something.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.959
Then we remembered something else.

06:52.875 --> 06:54.792
If my Mom and Dad find out about this ad,

06:54.875 --> 06:55.792
I’ll be in big trouble.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.750
They change those ads all the time.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.375
Tomorrow it'll be some other baby.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.750
You know what--

07:01.834 --> 07:04.333
You're probably right.

07:06.834 --> 07:08.834
Your voice used to be really high.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.250
I know, right?

07:16.625 --> 07:17.750
Good news, everyone.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.667
I’ve just learned
that your classmate Vanessa

07:20.750 --> 07:24.208
is recovering nicely
from the oven-mitt incident.

07:25.834 --> 07:31.000
Or should I say,
the lack-of-oven-mitt incident?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.542
The lesson here

07:33.625 --> 07:36.250
is that oven mitts should always be worn

07:36.333 --> 07:38.208
when grasping hot surfaces...

07:39.959 --> 07:42.375
And never used as puppets.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.083
Right, potty?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.792
He's on to us. Put me down.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.375
Remember-- the assignment this week

07:53.458 --> 07:56.792
is chicken divan
with a side dish of your choice.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.583
You will partner up to cook those.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.291
All: Yes, chef.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.000
Winnie, what am I gonna do?

08:04.083 --> 08:05.959
Vanessa was my cooking partner.

08:06.041 --> 08:09.875
I don't have a partner either
since Ricardo dumped me.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.583
Hey! Maybe we could team up.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.959
It'll be divan.

08:17.083 --> 08:18.166
I don't get it.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.041
Neither did Ricardo.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.667
So what do you say?

08:23.917 --> 08:25.917
Okay, sure. Let's work together.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.834
You didn't say that very enthusiastically.

08:28.917 --> 08:30.542
Oh, I’m sorry.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.750
I guess we're still in shock
over what happened to Vanessa.

08:32.834 --> 08:34.041
- Oh.
- Right, mitty?

08:34.125 --> 08:36.250
Right, chef.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.709
I make him call me chef.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.834
Okay.

08:48.917 --> 08:50.125
Hey, Teddy. What you doing?

08:50.208 --> 08:51.709
Hey, mom. Oh, I’m just looking

08:51.792 --> 08:54.125
at old photographs.

08:54.208 --> 08:55.125
Is this you?

08:55.208 --> 08:56.709
Oh, no, that's aunt Jamie.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.291
I’m the prettier one over here.

09:00.792 --> 09:03.083
Hey, whatever happened
between you and her anyway?

09:03.166 --> 09:05.291
Well, if you must know,
we had a falling-out.

09:05.375 --> 09:08.959
What did you do?
I-- I mean, what happened?

09:09.792 --> 09:11.458
Well, she was supposed
to be the maid of honor

09:11.542 --> 09:13.041
at my wedding, but she didn't show up.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.959
Why the sudden interest in Jamie?

09:16.750 --> 09:19.208
Well, I ran into her at the mall,

09:19.250 --> 09:21.458
and she kind of didn't want you to know.

09:21.875 --> 09:22.792
Typical.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.083
Yeah, typical.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.750
She doesn't like me. Do you know why?

09:27.834 --> 09:29.792
Well, it could be-- Oh!

09:31.834 --> 09:33.542
You weren't really looking for an answer.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.959
She's always been jealous of me

09:37.041 --> 09:38.750
because I’m the one who got married.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.458
I’m the one with the happy family.

09:40.542 --> 09:41.667
Bob: Amy!

09:41.750 --> 09:44.917
I can't find my underpants!

09:46.709 --> 09:48.375
They're all dirty!

09:48.417 --> 09:51.333
Either do the laundry
or wear your bathing suit!

09:53.792 --> 09:54.709
What was I saying?

09:54.792 --> 09:56.166
Oh, yeah. She's jealous.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.709
You know, Mom, as long as she's in town,

10:00.792 --> 10:03.709
maybe you should make peace
with aunt Jamie.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.125
Why should I?

10:05.667 --> 10:07.417
Because you're sisters.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.500
And?

10:09.667 --> 10:12.291
And you have so much

10:12.375 --> 10:14.291
and she has so little.

10:14.625 --> 10:15.875
And?

10:17.959 --> 10:21.792
And you can prove
you're still the prettier one.

10:23.166 --> 10:24.375
Set it up.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.250
No ads with Toby's picture
in today's paper.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.875
I guess we're good.

10:34.959 --> 10:36.542
Wait, dude, check this out.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.875
If today was my birthday,
I'd be warm, generous,

10:38.959 --> 10:41.959
and have an amazing ability
to entertain people.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.750
Definitely not your birthday.

10:45.333 --> 10:46.750
Hey.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.291
You guys want to give me
a hand with the groceries?

10:52.709 --> 10:53.750
Oh, no. Oh, no.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.083
Toby's on the bag.

10:55.542 --> 10:58.417
Secrets from the past
are coming back to haunt us.

11:00.667 --> 11:03.458
I got to go talk to the photographer
and shut this thing down.

11:03.542 --> 11:04.750
And you're coming with me.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.583
Aw, man. Happy birthday to me, huh?

11:07.625 --> 11:08.917
It's not your birthday.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.750
Hey!

11:16.583 --> 11:18.959
Wow, thanks a lot, guys.

11:20.792 --> 11:22.375
Ah! Looks just like Toby.

11:30.792 --> 11:31.792
Here she comes.

11:34.875 --> 11:35.875
Thank you.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.208
- Amy.
- Jamie.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.375
So far so good. Right, Mom?

11:44.041 --> 11:45.625
Jamie, I’m-- I’m...

11:46.083 --> 11:47.792
I’m glad you agreed to meet me.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.750
Of course. Of course.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.250
It gives me the opportunity to do this.

11:53.375 --> 11:54.750
Wh--

12:03.041 --> 12:05.625
I cannot believe you just did that.

12:05.709 --> 12:06.750
Jamie: Uh-huh.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.417
I went there.

12:08.625 --> 12:10.125
I buttered you.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.750
Why are you mad at me?

12:12.834 --> 12:14.834
You're the one who didn't
show up at my wedding.

12:14.917 --> 12:16.917
Because of what you
did to me in high school.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.625
What did I do to you in high school?

12:18.709 --> 12:21.083
You stole Bob Diddlebock from me!

12:21.166 --> 12:23.792
It always comes back to Bob Diddlebock.

12:26.542 --> 12:29.041
Bob Diddlebock came over
to pick me up for a date.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.375
And when I went upstairs to get dressed,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.291
those two were talking
and somebody was flirting.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.750
By the time I came out,
both of them were gone.

12:36.458 --> 12:39.000
So it's my fault you're a slow dresser?

12:39.792 --> 12:40.875
It was the '80s.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.875
I was looking for my leg warmers.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.583
Then to make matters worse,

12:46.667 --> 12:48.875
she dumps him for Bob Duncan.

12:48.959 --> 12:51.667
Which means you could have
gone back to Bob Diddlebock.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.792
Oh, like Diddles is gonna
date me after you.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.333
Diddles?

12:56.166 --> 12:57.959
I’m out of here.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.667
See? Still jealous.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.125
What's your soup today?

13:16.375 --> 13:17.709
Hi, I’m Winnie.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.834
I go to cooking school with PJ.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.333
Oh, hey, I’m Bob.

13:21.417 --> 13:22.625
How are you? Come on in.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.041
Uh, PJ ran to the store.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.583
He should be right back. Have a seat.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.208
- Okay.
- So,

13:27.250 --> 13:29.625
you're the girl PJ's been talking about.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.125
He's been talking about me?

13:32.208 --> 13:33.542
What was he saying?

13:33.625 --> 13:34.875
Was it hurtful?

13:34.959 --> 13:37.709
No, on the contrary.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.125
He was actually kind of excited
that you were coming over.

13:40.750 --> 13:41.917
Excited?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.500
No, that is not the feedback
I usually get.

13:45.834 --> 13:49.041
I hope I’m not talking out of school
when I say that my son

13:49.125 --> 13:51.500
is really looking forward
to cooking with you.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.417
You know, he even mentioned dessert.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.709
I’m getting the feeling that he likes me.

13:58.625 --> 13:59.959
Are you saying that he likes me?

14:00.041 --> 14:01.542
Seems that way to me.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.208
This is amazing.

14:05.667 --> 14:10.417
First, I get into cooking school,
and then I get a boyfriend?

14:10.667 --> 14:12.250
It's finally happened.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.959
I am in the zone!

14:20.166 --> 14:22.125
I can't handle the zone.
The zone is freaking me out.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.417
Huh.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.750
Hey, Dad. Isn't Winnie here yet?

14:32.834 --> 14:34.667
She was. She was.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.750
And then she wasn't.

14:37.917 --> 14:39.000
What happened?

14:39.333 --> 14:40.625
I couldn't tell you.

14:40.709 --> 14:42.875
I mean, we were sitting here talking.

14:42.959 --> 14:43.792
She seemed nice.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.542
She seemed very excited
that you liked her.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.125
No, no, Dad. No, no, no.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.709
You got the wrong girl.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.792
I don't like Winnie. I like Vanessa.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.083
Oh.

15:01.792 --> 15:04.709
Mommy, will I always
be friends with Teddy?

15:04.792 --> 15:06.709
Well, of course you will.
why wouldn't you be?

15:06.792 --> 15:09.166
Because you don't like your sister.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.375
Teddy.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.667
Yes, Mom?

15:15.583 --> 15:16.709
Really?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.458
Okay, to be fair,

15:18.542 --> 15:19.792
there's a lot of really good stuff

15:19.875 --> 15:21.291
that she forgot to say.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.000
It wasn't that good.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.250
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

15:26.333 --> 15:28.750
Look-- the point is, Mom,

15:28.834 --> 15:29.959
sisters should get along.

15:30.041 --> 15:32.750
Families are supposed to love each other.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.750
Isn't that what you always tell us?

15:35.959 --> 15:37.750
Using my own words against me,

15:37.834 --> 15:38.875
well played.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.333
So?

15:41.834 --> 15:43.667
So...

15:44.458 --> 15:46.583
Call up aunt Jamie. Invite her over.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.041
Let's just end this thing
once and for all.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.959
Family is forever.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.417
Oh, sure, now you say it.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.208
You again?

16:02.291 --> 16:04.208
- Hey, we need to talk.
- I’m a little busy here.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.375
It's important. I could be in big trouble.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.083
Fine!

16:08.166 --> 16:10.000
At least you didn't bring
your annoying, redheaded--

16:10.083 --> 16:11.667
Hello.

16:12.792 --> 16:15.125
That revolving door was confusing.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.000
What do you guys want?

16:20.417 --> 16:21.375
Hey--

16:21.458 --> 16:23.208
You got to stop using these pictures.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.375
No, I don't.

16:24.458 --> 16:25.583
You signed a legal release.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.250
I can do whatever I want
with those pictures.

16:29.542 --> 16:31.083
If you won't do it for us,

16:31.166 --> 16:32.959
do it for him.

16:33.542 --> 16:35.875
Look at that sad little face.

16:38.542 --> 16:41.041
I said "sad." Work with me.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.250
All right.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.750
Normally, I wouldn't do this,
but today's my birthday

16:47.834 --> 16:49.834
and I’m feeling warm and generous.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.000
Also, you're an amazing entertainer.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.917
I’ll get Hank's market to pull
all the ads with your brother.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.834
But...

16:59.917 --> 17:01.417
There is something I need from you.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.750
Walter: Good, good.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.041
Hold it up a little bit more.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.625
Good. Now you're proud...

17:08.709 --> 17:10.208
Yeah, but you're not cocky.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.208
What is this for again?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.500
Dutch delights, a new line of pastries.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.834
Okay, now you,

17:16.917 --> 17:18.792
love the pastry a little bit more.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.417
And you...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.625
love the pastry a little less.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.208
Do we get to keep these outfits?

17:37.834 --> 17:39.083
Hi, Winnie.

17:39.542 --> 17:41.667
- Oh, hi, PJ.
- Hi.

17:42.333 --> 17:43.792
Listen, I need to talk to you.

17:43.875 --> 17:45.583
I need to talk to you too.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.792
Oh-- Sorry I ran out yesterday,

17:47.875 --> 17:50.625
but your dad told me how you feel.

17:50.709 --> 17:52.166
Yeah, right. Listen, the thing is I--

17:52.250 --> 17:54.542
Don't speak.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.166
Have you been chopping garlic?

17:59.250 --> 18:00.250
What's that?

18:00.333 --> 18:01.625
I said...

18:02.125 --> 18:03.583
Have you been chopping garlic?

18:05.041 --> 18:07.542
Oh, yeah, sorry.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.041
Um, PJ...

18:11.166 --> 18:12.583
I like you.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.709
And you like me,

18:14.792 --> 18:17.208
but there can't be an "us" right now.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.417
There can't?

18:18.500 --> 18:22.333
No, I have another love.

18:22.417 --> 18:25.083
And his name is food preparation.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.625
Is he like foreign or--

18:28.709 --> 18:30.083
No!

18:33.291 --> 18:34.917
I’m talking about my career.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.375
- Oh, oh.
- That's more important to me right now.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.709
Do you think you can pretend

18:41.792 --> 18:43.208
that there's nothing between us?

18:43.291 --> 18:44.333
Uh-huh.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.667
Wow.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.250
You are so brave.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.875
Good news, chef.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.667
You know that--

18:55.750 --> 18:58.375
That personal problem
I was telling you about?

18:58.458 --> 19:01.542
Well, we've decided to remain friends.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.333
I wasn't listening then...

19:06.542 --> 19:09.125
And I’m not listening now.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.750
Thank you for coming over, aunt Jamie.

19:22.834 --> 19:25.041
My mom has something she'd like to say.

19:25.834 --> 19:26.834
Jamie.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.375
I know it couldn't have been easy

19:30.500 --> 19:33.083
growing up in the shadows
of Amy Blankenhooper.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.500
And we're off the tracks already.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.083
Okay.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.083
I admit that, in high school,

19:41.166 --> 19:43.250
I was somewhat self-obsessed.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.417
High school?

19:44.500 --> 19:45.667
Somewhat?

19:49.166 --> 19:50.917
Look, what I’m trying to say is

19:52.041 --> 19:54.458
I shouldn't have stolen Bob Diddlebock.

19:54.959 --> 19:55.875
And I’m sorry.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.000
I’m sorry too.

19:59.792 --> 20:03.166
I-- I should have
come to your wedding, no matter what.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.291
Two apologies in the bank.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.375
Now all we're missing is a hug.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.500
Come here.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.959
I’m so glad we're friends again.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.750
Now I have a surprise for you.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.083
I knew it was going too well.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.250
No, no, no. It's a good surprise.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.208
Go look outside.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.542
It's Bob Diddlebock!

20:34.458 --> 20:35.834
I found him online.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.041
He was so excited

20:37.125 --> 20:38.834
when I told him that
you were still single.

20:38.917 --> 20:40.542
He's more handsome now than ever.

20:40.625 --> 20:41.709
He is?

20:41.792 --> 20:43.709
Maybe I should just pop out and say hi.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.000
I don't think so.

20:50.625 --> 20:53.625
So that's the famous Bob Diddlebock, huh?

20:53.709 --> 20:57.083
Yeah, he started his own company.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.375
He's worth millions now.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.792
Bob: Honey!

21:01.875 --> 21:03.083
My bathing suit's dirty!

21:03.166 --> 21:04.542
What do I wear now?

21:06.125 --> 21:07.375
Not a good time, Dad.

21:13.750 --> 21:17.375
Well, Charlie, the great
Blankenhooper sister feud

21:17.458 --> 21:20.166
is now a thing of the past.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.250
And aunt Jamie had a great time

21:22.333 --> 21:23.750
on her date with Bob Diddlebock.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.166
They went on his private jet.

21:26.917 --> 21:29.375
Don't tell mom.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.750
Gabe: Excuse me.
We're trying to watch a game here.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.041
Sorry.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.458
Tv announcer: Today's aerial coverage

21:34.542 --> 21:37.417
brought to you by the
Dutch delights blimp.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.041
What?

21:39.709 --> 21:41.417
Hey, check out that blimp.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.041
You know, that look--

21:43.125 --> 21:44.709
That looks like you and Jake

21:44.792 --> 21:46.375
in little Dutch boy outfits.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.709
Come on, Dad. That's ridiculous.

21:49.792 --> 21:51.917
Get your eyes checked.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.834
Dude, turn it on channel 4.

21:55.917 --> 21:57.208
We are famous.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.625
I’m not sure what's going on here,

22:03.709 --> 22:06.291
but somebody's gonna need
some good luck, Charlie.

22:11.792 --> 22:12.917
Hey, nice job today, mitty.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.083
Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.

22:15.166 --> 22:16.458
That's true. We make a perfect team.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.291
What about me?

22:18.375 --> 22:21.125
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?

22:21.208 --> 22:22.125
Who's this?

22:22.208 --> 22:23.375
I’m Glovey.

22:23.458 --> 22:24.875
I cook with him at home.

22:26.417 --> 22:27.667
You said you never cook at home.

22:27.750 --> 22:29.542
Did I say that?
I don't remember saying that.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.375
Well, now that I’m here,

22:33.458 --> 22:34.667
you can leave.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.959
I’m not going anywhere. He's mine!

22:37.041 --> 22:38.750
- No, he's mine.
- Guys, guys.

22:38.834 --> 22:39.959
I can't take all this fighting.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.834
Okay? I’m out of here.
