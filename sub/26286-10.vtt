WEBVTT

00:02.870 --> 00:04.872
Previously on This Is Us...

00:04.905 --> 00:06.507
You've always said that
you wanted to finish school.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.575
I think the time is now.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.410
Oh, my God, it's a boy.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.012
I went to a database
for the war memorial.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.981
Nicholas Pearson.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.150
He might be dead, but he didn't
die here in Vietnam.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.186
BETH:
She will break you, Kevin.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.754
Her background is complicated.

00:20.788 --> 00:21.855
You're not gonna
win this one, Randall.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.057
The numbers aren't there.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.358
BETH:
You told me that

00:24.392 --> 00:26.760
if at any point,
I wasn't on board

00:26.794 --> 00:27.995
with you running,
you would stop.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.364
I am no longer on board
with you running.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.571
NEWSCASTER: We have an update in
perhaps the most surprising race

00:37.605 --> 00:40.274
in the local Philadelphia
elections tonight.

00:40.308 --> 00:43.611
District 12 remains too close
to call with long-time incumbent

00:43.644 --> 00:46.580
Solomon Brown ahead
only four percentage points

00:46.614 --> 00:49.617
-of challenger Randall Pearson.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.785
"Keep the Chardonnay coming"
is how I'm doing.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.621
NEWSCASTER: Councilman Brown
is leading 52%...

00:53.654 --> 00:56.924
Well, one way or another,
it'll all be over soon.

00:56.957 --> 01:00.628
:
Yeah, it'll all be over soon.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.297
NEWSCASTER: Councilman Solomon
Brown, a 14-year incumbent,

01:03.331 --> 01:04.898
-first made a name
for himself...
-Here you go.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.101
Oh, I was not built
for politics.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.969
This is way too tense for me.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.205
Yeah, my undershirt
is fully soaked.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.040
-NEWSCASTER: Brown voted
yes to Proposition 27...
-Stop.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.576
...which brought better housing
programs to his district.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.211
Big life moment for you,
little brother.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.912
What's going through your mind?

01:18.946 --> 01:21.715
-Yeah.

01:21.749 --> 01:25.052
You remember when Dad and I went
to D.C. to visit Howard?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.888
-Of course.
-Been thinking about that a lot.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.057
You

01:30.090 --> 01:34.128
What's on my mind? Uh, John
Stamos, mostly. Ex-excuse me.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.197
John Stamos.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.301
Hi.

01:40.334 --> 01:44.138
Hi. Oh, uh...

01:46.707 --> 01:48.509
'Cause I'm not,
I'm not sure if I'm supposed

01:48.542 --> 01:50.278
to be talking to you,
or giving you space,

01:50.311 --> 01:52.580
so I'm just gonna talk to you
from multiple feet away

01:52.613 --> 01:54.648
and sort of
split the difference.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.955
Zoe, I'm sorry
if I pushed you...

02:01.989 --> 02:06.059
Kevin, I can't do this.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.508
Tobe, hey, what's up?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.176
TOBY: Hey. Look, uh,
Kate has been crying

02:22.210 --> 02:23.777
for, like,
five minutes straight.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.479
Is there, like, a twin cure
for something like this?

02:25.513 --> 02:28.115
Um, is it-is it good crying
or bad crying?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.117
-Unclear.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.720
-Unclear.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.589
Hey, look, Toby, I got to go.
I'll call you back.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.460
-Well, we're behind,

02:39.493 --> 02:42.296
but, uh, whatever happens, dude,

02:42.330 --> 02:46.200
what you did in these last
seven weeks, it's unheard of.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.836
Yeah.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.005
It's been the longest
seven weeks of my life.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.745
*

03:04.385 --> 03:06.654
Hey, Randall. Randall.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.855
RANDALL:
Yeah.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.858
Get up, come on. Annie's up.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.026
She doesn't need to see you
sleeping on the couch.

03:16.864 --> 03:20.934
Ah, crap. I wanted to be back
in Philly by 9:00.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.070
You're still running?

03:23.103 --> 03:25.072
After last night?

03:25.105 --> 03:28.075
After-after Jae-won said
you couldn't win?

03:28.108 --> 03:30.210
He didn't say I couldn't win. He
said the numbers aren't there.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.246
Well, they're somewhere, Beth.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.848
I can't just give up on
my district, not after all this.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.117
Oh, your district.
What about your family?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.887
Will always be
my priority, okay?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.423
Look, I even thought
about Tess last night.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.725
I, uh, I ordered Love, Ellen.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.694
It's the book
Ellen DeGeneres's mom Betty

03:46.727 --> 03:48.228
wrote about Ellen coming out.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.130
I'm gonna listen to it
on my way to Philly.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.866
You cannot audiobook your way
through our daughter's life.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.036
Look, the next seven
weeks are gonna be tough.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.905
I know.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.740
But the people we've met
in that district

03:59.773 --> 04:02.610
over the past few months,
they deserve my best...

04:02.643 --> 04:04.878
There is no "we" in this
anymore, Randall.

04:04.912 --> 04:10.150
I will stay out of your way,
but you're on your own, babe.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.159
*

04:25.265 --> 04:26.900
JACK:
You know, I'll bet

04:26.934 --> 04:28.636
Abraham Lincoln woke up
every morning,

04:28.669 --> 04:30.838
stood on the steps of the
White House, and he took in

04:30.871 --> 04:34.608
the same 555 feet that
we're looking at right now.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.311
Hmm, they finished it
20 years after he died, so...

04:39.146 --> 04:40.514
You're ruining the romance, kid.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.850
Facts are facts, Dad.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.017
Hmm.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.823
I'm thinking about majoring
in political science.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.459
No kidding.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.994
Look at you.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.163
What a great life
you're gonna have.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.033
What a great man
you're gonna be.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.669
-Hmm.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.329
-TOBY: Did somebody call

05:29.363 --> 05:31.799
a future Dad Bod award winner?
Huh?

05:31.832 --> 05:35.335
: So, I was thinking,
we're just using this room

05:35.369 --> 05:37.304
-to store all of our junk,
you know?
-Um, junk...

05:37.337 --> 05:41.542
I think it's time that we turn
this room into a nursery.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.312
I am so on board.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.380
-Yeah, yeah, I was just waiting

05:46.414 --> 05:47.648
'cause you were hesitant.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.150
Yeah. So, you need to sell
all your toys.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.085
-KEVIN: Ugh.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.690
Longest travel day of my life.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.692
Ah. Well, we took off
Wednesday afternoon,

05:58.726 --> 06:00.561
landed Wednesday morning,
so technically,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.329
it's the shortest travel day
of your life.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.898
Yeah, time zones are crazy, huh?
You know what else is crazy?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.535
That your uncle didn't die
in Vietnam?

06:07.568 --> 06:09.770
That my uncle didn't die in
Vietnam. That's exactly right.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.705
And now I have a million more
questions about it, you know?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.674
Like, uh, I don't know,
did he come back to the States?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.876
All right, did my dad know
that he was alive?

06:15.909 --> 06:18.746
Uh, or-or maybe
it's like Mad Men, right?

06:18.779 --> 06:21.014
Where he died,
but somebody took his dog tags.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.418
Hey, slow your roll, Pearson.
We'll contact Veterans Affairs,

06:24.452 --> 06:26.119
find out what happened
and go from there.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.455
What are you gonna tell
your family?

06:27.488 --> 06:29.690
Are you... I'm not gonna tell
my family a thing.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.225
I mean,
the-the text chain was ungodly

06:32.259 --> 06:33.727
when Kate debated going blonde.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.262
I can't even imagine
what this would be like.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.531
-Good point.

06:37.565 --> 06:40.734
It feels so good to be home.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.772
Hmm.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.875
What?

06:47.908 --> 06:51.378
Oh, you calling my place "home."

06:51.411 --> 06:53.781
No, I didn't.
I called America home,

06:53.814 --> 06:55.916
-not your loft.
-Well, it could be.

06:55.949 --> 06:59.853
My loft. Your home.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.135
:
Is that...

07:15.168 --> 07:16.937
It's John Stamos, yeah.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.272
Tess and Annie got it for me.
There was a whole phase

07:19.306 --> 07:22.109
they were calling me
Uncle Jesse.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.648
What do you say?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.453
-Ah, you took the Stamos.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.322
I got a roommate!
This is gonna be great.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.658
-Oh, my God.
Let's go straight to bed.
-Oh, my God.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.535
Randall Pearson...

07:47.568 --> 07:50.103
Randall Pearson
will turn the lights back on.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.204
RANDALL:
All right, J-dog. Hit me

07:51.238 --> 07:52.806
with them new stats, man.
I know

07:52.840 --> 07:55.308
-we picked up some real heat.
-Eh, more like lukewarm heat.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.511
You're still ten points behind.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.814
How? Dude, we've done
so much walking door-to-door,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.616
I had to google what corns are

08:02.650 --> 08:05.553
to see if that's what I got
growing on my feet. It is.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.487
-Get some more
comfortable shoes.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.356
We've got a full day of pounding
the pavement ahead of us.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.959
-Mm.
-Oh, uh, also,
don't forget that we've got

08:11.992 --> 08:13.894
the Business Association
breakfast

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
-at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.
-Right.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.898
Guess I'll be
staying here again.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.300
You want to call Beth
and tell her for me?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.636
I'm sorry, dude. I warned you
this would be rough.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.237
Yeah.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.884
YOUNG RANDALL:
It scares me.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.687
The idea of, you know...

08:39.720 --> 08:42.690
doing something big
with my life.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.693
You know what I get like
when I get focused.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.696
Oh, it's like...

08:48.729 --> 08:51.632
it's like I can't see
anything else.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.705
And I look at you and Mom
and, you know, and our family.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.940
And I-I want that, too.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.510
You know, Randall, you...

09:03.543 --> 09:06.213
you might be the only
17-year-old on the planet

09:06.246 --> 09:09.016
who's actually worrying

09:09.049 --> 09:11.051
about balancing
their future career

09:11.084 --> 09:13.453
with their future wife and kids.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.624
:
I-I like to plan ahead.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.101
: These kids

09:28.135 --> 09:30.070
at my college,
they went crazy for our stuff.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.238
Yeah, well,
we're so old to them,

09:31.271 --> 09:33.140
our stuff is considered vintage.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.275
-Uh, uh...

09:35.308 --> 09:37.577
Uh, where, uh,
where's the, uh...

09:37.611 --> 09:39.579
where's the box
that I tucked under the counter?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.615
I-I don't know.
I think I sold it.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.085
No. No, it was marked, uh...
it was marked "DNS."

09:45.118 --> 09:47.387
Yeah, it was donations.
Yeah, I-I sold it.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.322
One less trip to the Goodwill.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.291
No, the...

09:51.324 --> 09:53.160
"DNS" does not stand
for "donations."

09:53.193 --> 09:54.795
It stands for "do not sell."

09:54.828 --> 09:57.731
That box was home
to my original complete set

09:57.765 --> 10:00.634
of 1977 Star Wars
action figures.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.903
I'm sorry.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.672
-It was an accident, babe.
-You should've asked.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.574
-Wait, but, babe,

10:07.607 --> 10:10.477
-come on, they're just toys.
-Whoa.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.512
Whoa. They are not just toys.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.115
They are action figures,
first of all.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.350
Action figures
that have traveled with me

10:17.384 --> 10:19.953
from house to house
after my parents got divorced,

10:19.987 --> 10:22.089
into my college dorm room,
through six L.A. apartments

10:22.122 --> 10:25.092
so that someday I could
hand them down to my kid.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.094
But now...

10:27.127 --> 10:28.996
Aah!

10:32.565 --> 10:34.001
KEVIN:
I'm sorry that we were late.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.669
Ah, man. It's my fault.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.304
I was slow getting out
of my apartment this morning.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.372
Well, actually,
it's our apartment.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.710
We, uh... we're living
together in sin.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.344
Yeah.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.680
I do show a record
for a Nicholas Pearson.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.181
That's great.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.217
But before
I can give you any information,

10:50.250 --> 10:53.153
I need proof
that you're his next of kin.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.522
How about nephew?
Nephew's a big deal now, right?

10:55.555 --> 10:56.990
Think of Game of Thrones.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.859
Right, Joffrey was next of kin

10:58.892 --> 11:01.895
to the super-handsome, fit,
blonde, uncle guy.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.331
Jamie was never in line
for the throne.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.033
Joffrey ascended

11:06.066 --> 11:09.502
after his adoptive father
Robert Baratheon died.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.906
Without documentation,

11:12.940 --> 11:15.408
you're gonna need someone
official to write a letter,

11:15.442 --> 11:17.344
authorizing release
of the records.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.379
Could be military personnel,

11:19.412 --> 11:21.248
a historian,
a member of Congress.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.850
How about a celebrity

11:22.883 --> 11:25.452
that was once dunk-tanked
on The Today Show?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.756
No. Okay.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.491
I might be able to get a letter
from a congressman.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.060
You might?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.395
Yeah, I might have dated one
for a while.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.830
You might have?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.766
Wow.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.441
MAN : And we're back
with Councilman Sol Brown.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.910
Now I've been seeing
some Randall Pearson signs

11:49.943 --> 11:51.178
all around the neighborhood.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.579
Hell, yeah, you have.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.447
BROWN:
I can't say I've noticed that.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.049
I'm just saying,
I haven't seen his family

11:56.083 --> 11:57.717
in church with him
at Reverend Hawley's services.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.754
I'm so lucky to have
my supportive wife Nancy

12:00.788 --> 12:03.056
at my side,
helping me stay focused.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.125
Not sure
my opponent is as lucky.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.336
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.373
Look, I know
this is the last thing

12:20.407 --> 12:22.910
you want to hear right now,
but maybe it's time

12:22.943 --> 12:25.478
you and the girls start
showing up to events again.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.081
Really?

12:28.115 --> 12:31.118
Just saying, I'm coming off as
a family man without a family.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.621
Do you know what the girls got
for Christmas, Family Man?

12:34.654 --> 12:36.289
I do, 'cause I went out

12:36.323 --> 12:39.492
and bought all their presents
without you.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.262
-I'm really sorry. I...
-And Tess is moody all the time,

12:42.295 --> 12:44.731
I don't even know why.
I don't know if it's 'cause

12:44.764 --> 12:46.399
she's trying
to figure out her sexuality,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.268
or-or because she just
discovered Nirvana on Spotify.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.838
Either way, I'd love
to discuss it with my husband,

12:50.871 --> 12:53.340
but he's off in Philly,
glad-handing

12:53.373 --> 12:56.509
for no good reason,
because last I checked,

12:56.543 --> 12:59.913
the polls said you weren't even
close to winning.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.149
Now,
are you really mad at me, Beth?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.317
Or are you mad
that I got something

13:04.351 --> 13:06.319
that I care about right now
and you don't?

13:06.353 --> 13:08.188
'Cause if memory serves,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.090
I played Stay-At-Home Superdad
all last year,

13:10.123 --> 13:11.859
and you did not hear me
complaining.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.695
You know what?
I'm gonna walk out of this room

13:15.728 --> 13:17.630
before you say something else
you're gonna regret.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.200
You do what you got to do.

13:24.504 --> 13:25.973
KEVIN:
Congressman,

13:26.006 --> 13:27.340
thank you so much
for meeting with us.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.775
I appreciate it.
You know, my brother,

13:28.808 --> 13:30.677
uh, currently running
for city council.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.479
He's going absolutely insane
with the schedule. I can only

13:32.512 --> 13:34.547
-imagine what yours is like.
-Yes, thank you so much

13:34.581 --> 13:36.149
for coming, Andy.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.685
I didn't know
you were living in New York now.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.387
Well, it's... it's, uh,
pretty recent, really.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.055
Yeah, pretty recent. Your bo...
Her boxes just came in

13:42.089 --> 13:44.457
-from Chicago, like, last week.
-Yeah.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.527
So, haven't really had a chance
to even unpack them yet.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.530
Well, that's great.

13:50.563 --> 13:54.134
So, you said you needed help
with getting some military

13:54.167 --> 13:55.735
-Yes.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.570
Well, we've been
on this journey,

13:57.604 --> 14:00.340
literally to Vietnam and back,
looking for Kevin's uncle.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.143
And we heard
that with a little push

14:03.176 --> 14:06.679
from a member of Congress,
we, um...

14:07.780 --> 14:09.416
Oh.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.385
I thought when you said
you desperately needed help,

14:12.419 --> 14:14.587
it was something
a little more serious.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.856
-Oh.
-Oh.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.691
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to...

14:18.725 --> 14:21.828
No. Sorry. It's fine. I can try
to get the records from the VA.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.731
Maybe I'll just shoot them
a quick e-mail.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.466
That should do the trick, right?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.343
Sorry. I...

14:36.376 --> 14:38.178
I really thought
enough time had passed.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.248
Andy...

14:41.281 --> 14:44.451
My office will formulate a
formal request for the records.

14:44.484 --> 14:47.054
Thank you. Appreciate that.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.989
Thank you for your time.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.031
-Well, that worked.
-Yeah. Look...

14:58.065 --> 15:00.633
That guy's carrying around
some serious baggage,

15:00.667 --> 15:03.270
Zoe, what...
what's the story with you two?

15:03.303 --> 15:04.804
Were you two serious?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.940
I mean, we were.

15:06.974 --> 15:10.543
Uh, we dated
for a couple of years.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.946
Uh, we talked
about moving to New York.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.320
I... I'm on the edge
of my seat here, Zoe.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.456
Well, he kept on sending
apartment listings,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.592
and, well,
none of them felt right.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.594
-Hmm.
-And, uh,

15:27.627 --> 15:29.896
well, I realized the apartments
weren't the problem,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.731
so I e-mailed him saying

15:31.764 --> 15:33.433
I thought the relationship
had run its course.

15:33.466 --> 15:36.503
You dated a guy for two years,

15:36.536 --> 15:39.772
and you broke up with him...
with an e

15:39.806 --> 15:41.908
I mean, I didn't deal with it
perfectly.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.977
It was a long time ago.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.678
I got to run.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.914
If I'm late for meeting Beth
for cookie baking...

15:47.947 --> 15:49.516
-...she'll flip.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.351
Apparently,
your brother's been AWOL.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.087
I don't want to be on
the receiving end of that mood.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.023
Yeah. All right.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.392
Bye.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.710
Hey, uh, before you leave...

16:17.744 --> 16:19.612
Mm-mmm. Nope, not tonight.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.149
It is New Year's Eve, my friend,
and I'm on my way

16:22.182 --> 16:24.184
to get a boo-berry pie
to eat with my girls

16:24.217 --> 16:26.453
-when the clock strikes 12:00.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.455
It's technically blueberry,
but when Beth was three,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.690
-she called it "boo-berry."
-Huh.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.126
Come on, man.
Nothing for "boo

16:33.160 --> 16:35.195
Anyway, Beth's family used
to have one every New Year's.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.663
She said
the new year don't start

16:36.696 --> 16:38.698
-till she get her boo-berry on.
-I found it.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.467
What we've been looking for.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.002
Six years ago, Sol Brown was
arrested for drunk driving,

16:43.036 --> 16:45.705
but he was never charged.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.308
Randall, he paid off the police
to have the charges dropped.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.310
And then he paid the paper
to have the story buried.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.679
That's major.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.982
We should release this
first thing in the morning.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.418
How do you like them
boo

17:06.859 --> 17:09.429
Hello. Uh,
one blueberry pie, please.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.863
Ooh, I'm sorry.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.932
We just sold the last one.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.535
Okay, then.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.705
Um... could you make me one?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.407
My wife requires one
every New Year's Eve.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.409
I'll wait,
however long it takes.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.711
I wish I could, sir, but we bake
everything in the morning.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.913
-Next in line.
-It's just, just one blueberry.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.781
-I can't. I'm sorry.
-It's for my wife..

17:28.815 --> 17:31.017
-I wish I could help you,
sweetie. I can't.
-Okay.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.122
Everything okay, Mr. Pearson?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.490
Reverend Hawley.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.793
Hi.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.863
Um, no, I'm fine. I just,

17:43.896 --> 17:45.765
uh...

17:45.798 --> 17:48.268
standing here
in the middle of a diner

17:48.301 --> 17:51.204
at 7:00 on New Year's Eve,

17:51.238 --> 17:54.241
wondering if I'm gonna go down
in history

17:54.274 --> 17:57.210
as the worst husband and father
of all time,

17:57.244 --> 18:00.413
who also lost an election
by a landslide.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.082
-Well, you could drop out.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.619
I'm sure my good friend Sol
would, uh, throw you a party.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.824
I asked Sol to fix the lights
at the rec center,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.327
and he didn't do it.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.597
Then a little girl who reminds
me of my little girls got hurt.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.069
I just wanted to give the people
something better.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.438
I thought they deserved that.

18:27.374 --> 18:31.278
You know, my father once told me
that I was gonna be a great man.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.181
And my whole life,
in the back of my mind,

18:34.214 --> 18:37.217
I always wanted to be one.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.622
I'm starting to think
it might be harder

18:42.655 --> 18:45.124
to be a good man
than a great one.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.331
I'm sitting on something

18:51.364 --> 18:53.400
that could change
the whole game, and...

18:56.336 --> 18:59.005
: It's just not the way
I want to do it, man.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.447
I'm sorry, man.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.049
You just wanted to say "hi"
on New Year's Eve.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.951
I didn't mean
to take all your time.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.322
Hey, you know, I give a...
a lot of death-bed advice.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.590
Comes with the job, I guess.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.727
Death-bed advice.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.129
That's the gig.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.667
Act in a way that'll make you
smile when you're old and gray

19:27.700 --> 19:30.870
and lying under a pale pink
nursing-home blanket,

19:30.903 --> 19:34.073
thinking about...
the life you lived.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.710
You do that,

19:37.744 --> 19:40.280
you'll be the man
your father wanted.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.157
And give this to your wife.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.960
I got the last blueberry pie.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.231
Happy New Year, Mr. Pearson.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.304
Happy New Year's to you,
Reverend Hawley.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.041
God bless you, sir.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.281
*

20:24.056 --> 20:26.726
DEJA:
I know he's a hundred,

20:26.759 --> 20:29.896
but Anderson Cooper is so fine.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.765
Really

20:32.799 --> 20:35.968
-Okay.
-KATHY GRIFFIN:
...is in the White House now.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.871
-TESS: Hey, Dad.
-ANNIE: Hey.
-DEJA: Hey.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.907
-COOPER: How did everything
go there?
-It's late.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.409
GRIFFIN:
...not wearing pants.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.976
I'm sorry.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.978
Guess I should just be glad

20:46.012 --> 20:47.447
you made it
before the ball-drop.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.716
No, I'm sorry about everything.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.487
I, um...

20:54.521 --> 20:56.255
Hey, can we just, uh...

20:58.758 --> 21:02.094
I owe all four of you
an apology

21:02.128 --> 21:03.596
for everything
that I've been missing

21:03.630 --> 21:05.298
over the past couple of months.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.833
For the way in which

21:06.866 --> 21:09.769
I let this campaign
take over my entire life.

21:13.473 --> 21:16.676
You know, one day
I'm gonna be an old man...

21:16.709 --> 21:21.414
laying in bed, all pale, with
a pink blanket pulled over me.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.516
Or maybe
the pink blanket's pale.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.884
I can't remember.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.355
Anyway...

21:28.388 --> 21:31.958
do you know what
I'm gonna be thinking about?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.561
It's not about this election.

21:36.195 --> 21:39.332
I'm gonna be thinking
about blueberry pie.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.134
I'm gonna be thinking about, uh,

21:42.168 --> 21:45.304
making gingerbread trains
with my favorite four girls.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
This family...

21:49.175 --> 21:51.478
is what makes me special.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.015
You four...

21:56.048 --> 21:58.217
you're what make me great.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.523
And I'm sorry if I haven't done
a good job of...

22:03.556 --> 22:05.892
showing you that enough lately.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.064
Anyway...

22:12.098 --> 22:14.401
Now, who's ready for some pie?

22:14.434 --> 22:15.802
Oh, y'all know the new year

22:15.835 --> 22:18.471
doesn't start
till we get our boo-berry on.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.207
-*

22:21.240 --> 22:24.176
(music playing,
indistinct chatter, laughter)

22:26.513 --> 22:29.248
We don't even know
if this is the right place.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.484
Toby, I have spent two solid
weeks online friend-requesting

22:31.518 --> 22:33.019
every single person
in my college

22:33.052 --> 22:34.320
to track down this weirdo.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.255
: That's him.

22:36.288 --> 22:38.324
Gabe?

22:38.357 --> 22:39.392
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.260
You can't have them back.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.529
Ha!

22:42.562 --> 22:45.097
Here's the thing, Gabe.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.033
I made a really big mistake
when I sold those to you.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.069
-Sorry, no can do.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.038
-We'll pay for them.
I'll pay for them.
-Yeah.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.706
And what'd you pay, ten bucks?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.908
Waah.

22:55.942 --> 22:58.545
I'll give you $50.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.447
-I hate to be a dick,

23:00.480 --> 23:04.250
but that stuff's priceless.
Sorry.

23:04.283 --> 23:06.586
Now, see, I told you.
So let's just, let's go.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.655
No, no, no. I'm pregnant.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.091
:
And...

23:12.124 --> 23:15.628
for 40 years,
my husband was planning

23:15.662 --> 23:18.531
on giving those to his child
when he had one.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.433
And I am with said child.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.304
I literally have nothing
to give... my baby,

23:25.337 --> 23:28.307
because my entire house
burned down in a fire.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.109
Whoa.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.411
And my dad died.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.717
And... I literally,

23:37.750 --> 23:40.953
I mean, I don't have anything.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.823
Not... My Little Ponys,
not my Cabbage Patch dolls

23:43.856 --> 23:47.193
and not my Three Rivers Stadium
that my dad built for me.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.397
I'm not gonna have anything
to give to my baby

23:51.430 --> 23:53.299
from my childhood, but...

23:53.332 --> 23:55.768
but he can...
he can have something

23:55.802 --> 23:57.136
from his father.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.571
So, Gabe,

23:58.605 --> 24:01.440
just ask yourself:

24:01.474 --> 24:04.310
do you really want to spend
your New Year's Eve

24:04.343 --> 24:06.746
disappointing a pregnant lady
whose father died

24:06.779 --> 24:09.348
because of a devastating
house fire?

24:13.686 --> 24:16.188
:
Yeah, sorry.

24:16.222 --> 24:17.990
Okay, happy New Year.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.259
"Yeah, sorry"?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.194
*

24:25.965 --> 24:28.000
-ZOE: Sorry that took forever.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.669
The salon was packed.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.104
Everyone getting gussied up
for New Year's Eve.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.706
I know.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.777
-I got your tux.
-Thank you.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.112
What are you ogling at
instead of me?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.114
It's, uh, Nicky's file.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.217
Why didn't you call?
-Uh-huh.

24:45.251 --> 24:47.386
Uh, there's
no real answers here.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.022
Just that he got medevacked
out of Vietnam in '71

24:50.056 --> 24:53.025
and sent to, uh,
Walter Reed for a psych eval.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.794
And then what?

24:54.827 --> 24:57.296
He, uh, got discharged
a few months later.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.833
He signed his papers
"Clark Kent"?

25:00.867 --> 25:03.536
Yeah, here, just... look, you
can just read the whole thing.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.638
You don't need to hover
over me like that.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.239
Just, you know, have at it.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.077
-Don't worry about it.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.512
Uh, Kevin,
if there's a problem...

25:13.546 --> 25:16.749
Yeah, okay, look, why haven't
you unpacked any of your stuff?

25:16.783 --> 25:19.151
I mean, should I...
should I be expecting an e-mail,

25:19.185 --> 25:22.054
like the one you sent
the congressman

25:22.088 --> 25:23.890
-Kevin...

25:23.923 --> 25:25.692
Huh? I mean, are...

25:25.725 --> 25:28.094
are we supposed to just,
uh, step over these things

25:28.127 --> 25:30.229
like-like land mines
for the rest of our lives?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.364
-Yeah.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.900
Zo, come on,

25:33.933 --> 25:36.202
you said you wanted
to move in, right?

25:36.235 --> 25:39.238
No. No. I didn't, actually.

25:39.271 --> 25:43.342
I told you I'd move in
to make you happy.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.712
Keep me happy?
Okay, great,

25:45.745 --> 25:48.114
so I'm the bad guy because
I asked you to move in with me?

25:48.147 --> 25:49.749
Yeah, because that's
what you do.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.785
Every step of this relationship
has been you...

25:52.819 --> 25:54.420
pushing me.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.454
-Yeah.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.023
-Yeah.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.891
That's how you think
this whole thing went down?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.027
You know what? I...
I don't want to talk

26:01.060 --> 26:02.795
-about this right now.
-No, of course, no,

26:02.829 --> 26:04.430
you don't want to talk
about it right now.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.865
You don't want
to talk about it ever.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.366
You just want to use
my living room

26:07.399 --> 26:08.801
as an obstacle course
for all of your crap.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.105
I need some space.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.074
*

26:28.120 --> 26:30.422
...your entire family
watch us eat dinner.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.093
Yeah.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.564
MAN :
Hold on. We're not ready.

26:42.034 --> 26:46.572
JACK: All that stuff
that you worry about,

26:46.605 --> 26:49.175
having balance...

26:49.208 --> 26:50.977
In my experience,

26:51.010 --> 26:54.580
there's one key piece
to that puzzle.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.850
I just hope the universe
puts the right person

26:57.884 --> 26:59.518
in your path.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.554
Like your mom was for me.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.357
You know, someone who...

27:05.391 --> 27:07.760
brings out all the...
the good stuff in you,

27:07.794 --> 27:09.128
all your best stuff.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.629
Because, my God, son,

27:10.663 --> 27:13.199
what a force you will be.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.807
You slept in.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.174
Mm.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.611
I was up late with the girls

27:25.644 --> 27:27.613
brushing up
on all the holiday movies

27:27.646 --> 27:30.382
I missed watching
with them this year.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.219
A Chipmunk Christmas
still makes me cry.

27:35.021 --> 27:38.324
Uh, thought you were going
to church today in Philly.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.526
Making your final push.

27:40.559 --> 27:42.661
Nah.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.868
When you and I started dating,

27:48.901 --> 27:52.571
a few weeks in I asked you to
go, uh, shoe shopping with me.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.840
You remember that?

27:53.873 --> 27:55.708
Do I remember?

27:55.742 --> 27:57.810
You had a full-on Terms of
Endearment-level meltdown

27:57.844 --> 27:59.545
in the middle of the Payless.

27:59.578 --> 28:02.514
And you tried to calm me down,
but you couldn't.

28:02.548 --> 28:05.752
So you just ended up
closing down the aisle

28:05.785 --> 28:07.486
while I sobbed.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.022
Like some kind
of shoe store traffic cop.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.724
-Even though
you didn't understand

28:11.758 --> 28:15.061
why a woman handing me
some rhinestone slingbacks

28:15.094 --> 28:17.897
could make me lose my mind.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.268
And it was that day

28:22.301 --> 28:25.704
I suspected
I might marry this dude.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.376
Well, damn, baby, you could have
saved a broke-ass college boy

28:30.409 --> 28:34.080
a lot of money on cheesy dates
if you'd have told me that then.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.084
-Husband.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.686
You are a man...

28:40.719 --> 28:45.191
who cares too much
and tries too hard.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.259
It's who you've always been.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.561
It's who I married.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.397
A great man.

28:54.901 --> 28:58.304
I will not let you forget

28:58.337 --> 29:00.639
who you are.

29:03.642 --> 29:05.978
I should've had your back.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.818
You need to finish
this campaign.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.660
Why did the slingbacks
make you cry?

29:27.199 --> 29:31.137
It was the woman
who brought them to me.

29:31.170 --> 29:34.974
She smelled like eucalyptus oil,
and my dad used to...

29:35.007 --> 29:37.376
:
...use it on his hands.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.848
I get it.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.617
I know you do.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.489
Now, get up. Okay?

29:50.522 --> 29:52.358
Get dressed.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.529
I'll tell the girls
to put their church clothes on.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.865
Yes, ma'am.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.699
HAWLEY:
Somebody say "amen."

30:00.732 --> 30:02.334
Amen!

30:02.368 --> 30:04.971
HAWLEY: Jesus knew, if he wanted
to be a great leader,

30:05.004 --> 30:08.540
he had to be a servant
to the people he served.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.042
-MAN: Yes, sir!
-Now, we all know

30:10.076 --> 30:12.111
we have to make
a big decision next Tuesday.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.313
-Mm-hmm.
-We got to decide

30:14.346 --> 30:15.948
who will serve us.

30:15.982 --> 30:18.017
-MAN: All right, now.
-MAN 2: That's right.

30:18.050 --> 30:21.320
Now, I've known Councilman
Sol Brown for 20 years.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.822
-Yes!
-He's a staple
of this community.

30:23.856 --> 30:26.859
-Yes, he is.
-Amen.
-He has served us proudly

30:26.893 --> 30:28.861
-for the last 15 years.
-Yes!

30:28.895 --> 30:32.664
Now, Randall Pearson I've
only known for a few months.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.034
He's got a lot of passion,

30:35.067 --> 30:38.004
but will he serve us?

30:38.037 --> 30:41.807
All I know is that he
is fundamentally decent,

30:41.840 --> 30:44.043
which isn't necessarily
in vogue these days.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.145
-Uh-huh!
-I know he drives

30:46.178 --> 30:49.481
two hours each way every day
to get here.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.084
He has knocked
on so many of our doors,

30:52.118 --> 30:54.753
when we sang "Somebody's
Knocking at Your Door"

30:54.786 --> 30:57.189
last Sunday, a little girl
called out, she said,

30:57.223 --> 30:59.525
-"It's Randall Pearson."

30:59.558 --> 31:02.661
It's not 15 years
of history here,

31:02.694 --> 31:05.864
but he has sure done a lot
with the time he's had.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.001
Now, the truth is,

31:09.035 --> 31:11.403
I think...

31:11.437 --> 31:14.673
we are in capable hands...

31:14.706 --> 31:18.444
-with either one of these men.
-CONGREGATION: Mm-hmm.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.212
-Somebody say "amen."
-CONGREGATION: Amen!

31:20.246 --> 31:21.981
-Amen!
-Amen!

31:23.749 --> 31:26.252
Well, that was unexpected.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.524
Hey, Tobe?

31:32.558 --> 31:33.993
TOBY:
Yeah?

31:37.829 --> 31:41.133
Wait. You can tell these
aren't yours from over there?

31:41.167 --> 31:42.368
:
Yeah.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.470
A man knows his Chewbacca.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.738
Where'd you get them?

31:46.772 --> 31:49.942
eBay.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.710
I tried to get yours back
from Gabe, but...

31:51.743 --> 31:54.280
God knows I tried. I mean...

31:54.313 --> 31:56.715
I tried things you would be
incredibly uncomfortable with.

31:56.748 --> 31:57.883
Those are pretty cool.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.151
They must've cost you a fortune.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.320
Eh.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.589
Yeah, I know.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.257
Babe,

32:05.291 --> 32:07.259
we're starting a new family.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.261
Our family.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.929
And, no, we don't have

32:10.963 --> 32:12.931
all of your action figures
to pass down.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.968
And, no, we don't have
my handmade football stadium.

32:16.002 --> 32:19.905
But, babe, we come with us.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.474
You don't need to pass down
your favorite thing to your son,

32:22.508 --> 32:26.645
because I know
with every part of me that you

32:26.678 --> 32:28.981
are gonna be
our son's favorite thing.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.750
-You.
-Mm.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.252
You hear me?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.487
Okay.
I got to go back

32:35.521 --> 32:37.489
to my laptop. They're selling
an original Boba Fett

32:37.523 --> 32:38.690
in, like, the next five.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.492
-Go. Go.
-Going!

32:47.133 --> 32:49.301
We have an update in perhaps
the most surprising race

32:49.335 --> 32:50.636
in the local Philadelphia
elections tonight...

32:50.669 --> 32:52.671
-Tobe.
-Okay. Come on in!

32:55.974 --> 32:58.144
Babe.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.512
-Oh.

33:01.847 --> 33:04.483
And... ta-da.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.352
*

33:14.993 --> 33:17.329
What...

33:23.035 --> 33:24.736
Well, I called Kevin,

33:24.770 --> 33:27.039
and he looked through
a bunch of photos and found one

33:27.073 --> 33:29.708
of the stadium
your dad built for you.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.043
*

33:38.184 --> 33:39.885
I took that photo to a...

33:39.918 --> 33:41.820
weird little man named Edwin

33:41.853 --> 33:43.555
who builds dollhouses,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.157
and then he built this replica.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.392
And, for the record,

33:46.425 --> 33:49.161
I'm going to be
our kid's second favorite thing.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.929
You're the first.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.033
Anyhow, I...

33:55.067 --> 33:56.935
I hope you like it.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.938
But it's okay if you don't.

33:59.971 --> 34:02.774
Oh, no,
is this going sideways on me?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.776
ZOE:
Kevin,

34:04.810 --> 34:06.478
I can't do this.

34:18.457 --> 34:20.926
Tobe, hey, what's up?

34:20.959 --> 34:23.028
Hey. Look, uh,
Kate has been crying for, like,

34:23.061 --> 34:24.430
five minutes straight.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.432
Is there, like, a twin cure
for something like this?

34:26.465 --> 34:27.533
Is it good crying or bad crying?

34:27.566 --> 34:28.767
TOBY:
Unclear.

34:31.137 --> 34:32.304
How's it going there?

34:32.338 --> 34:33.739
Unclear.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.407
Hey, Tobe, listen,
I got to go, all right?

34:35.441 --> 34:36.408
I'll c-- I'll call you back.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.144
All right.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.383
Is this a

34:44.416 --> 34:46.718
Yeah.

34:46.752 --> 34:50.222
It's a good cry.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.458
*

34:52.491 --> 34:54.260
JAE-WON:
Hey,

34:54.293 --> 34:57.062
um, whatever happens, dude,

34:57.095 --> 34:59.398
what you did
in these last seven weeks...

34:59.431 --> 35:00.999
it's unheard of.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.635
Yeah.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.838
It's been the longest
seven weeks of my life.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.243
Excuse me.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.179
Yeah.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.186
Any word yet?

35:20.219 --> 35:23.121
Sounds like we're not gonna find
out who won till after midnight.

35:23.155 --> 35:24.856
Okay.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.625
Yeah.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.297
Hey, guys.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.833
Could we all gather around,
please?

35:36.202 --> 35:37.936
Listen, I just wanted
to take a moment

35:37.969 --> 35:40.038
to thank you all for being here.

35:40.071 --> 35:44.376
I know these last few weeks,
um...

35:44.410 --> 35:46.212
I pushed you.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.113
But I pushed myself, too.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.683
Doors got slammed in our faces,
and we knocked again.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.686
Flyers got torn down
and thrown out,

35:54.720 --> 35:56.555
and we put up new ones.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.824
Whatever happened to us
in these tough days,

35:58.857 --> 36:00.992
we just kept pushing.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.662
And we did it
because we believed

36:03.695 --> 36:05.831
in what our future here
could be.

36:05.864 --> 36:08.667
We were given four words--

36:08.700 --> 36:10.636
"the numbers aren't there"--

36:10.669 --> 36:13.239
and we turned those
into four new ones--

36:13.272 --> 36:15.006
"too close to call."

36:15.040 --> 36:17.309
-So, um,

36:17.343 --> 36:19.711
go home proud.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.648
We're not gonna find out
what happened tonight.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.884
And I have a feeling
that we could all use the rest.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.319
So, thank you.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.887
Thank you, everyone!

36:34.426 --> 36:36.027
-Come on.
-All right.

36:36.061 --> 36:37.863
-Proud of you, man.
-Thank you.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.598
-Appreciate it, man. Okay.
-I'll call you.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.434
RANDALL:
Thank you very much, sir.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.536
Appreciate you being here.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.079
I have pepper spray.

36:54.112 --> 36:56.081
Kevin, relax.

36:56.114 --> 36:57.916
It's just me.

36:59.285 --> 37:02.220
-Oh.

37:03.289 --> 37:05.924
No.

37:05.957 --> 37:08.560
Listen, Kevin, you...

37:08.594 --> 37:11.196
you're one of the only people
that knows

37:11.229 --> 37:13.198
what my dad...

37:13.231 --> 37:14.433
and, um...

37:17.336 --> 37:20.706
I had three locks
on my apartment door in Chicago,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.040
bars on the windows,

37:22.073 --> 37:23.642
not because
I was actually worried

37:23.675 --> 37:25.411
about someone breaking in,
but...

37:25.444 --> 37:28.414
peace of mind was...

37:28.447 --> 37:31.283
taken from me.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.884
I'm sorry.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.286
I can't even imagine that.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.590
It's a lot for me to...

37:38.624 --> 37:40.492
give up my own safe space.

37:40.526 --> 37:43.261
More than it is for most people.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.331
And, uh...

37:45.364 --> 37:48.166
the idea of giving that up,

37:48.199 --> 37:50.602
it's, uh...

37:50.636 --> 37:53.772
it's why I've never lived
with anyone before.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.342
We don't have
to live together, then.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.110
You know? Uh, or you don't
even have to unpack, actually.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.313
I'll just-- I'll walk over your
stuff for the rest of my life.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.814
It'll be good for my calves.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.750
I want to live with you.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.485
I do.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.253
And, uh...

38:08.286 --> 38:09.988
Because even though you,

38:10.021 --> 38:13.992
you just might be the most pushy
person I have ever met,

38:14.025 --> 38:16.161
I...

38:16.194 --> 38:20.699
I think I like
what you're pushing for.

38:23.301 --> 38:27.172
I'm in love with you.

38:27.205 --> 38:31.142
And I want John Stamos back.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.213
("Sense of Home"
by Harrison Storm playing)

38:40.051 --> 38:42.220
Let's go home.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.189
*

38:47.693 --> 38:49.695
* For these words

38:49.728 --> 38:52.564
* He won't come around

38:52.598 --> 38:53.565
* Here...

38:53.599 --> 38:55.200
Oh, this one's not mine.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.302
No, that-- uh,
that's a box of my dad's stuff.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.137
It's where I found
the Vietnam mementos.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.172
It must've gotten mixed up
with your stuff.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.075
Babe?

39:04.109 --> 39:05.644
Where do you want
the weird voodoo dolls?

39:05.677 --> 39:06.845
-They're not weird.
-Mm.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.246
-They're from Haiti.
-Oh.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.915
Don't mess with my voodoo, boy.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.249
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.919
I'll just put those
right over here.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.390
"Jack, Last one.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.991
C.K."

39:20.025 --> 39:22.994
Who's C.K.?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.764
Let me see that.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.201
"C.K."

39:32.370 --> 39:35.541
Like Clark Kent.

39:35.574 --> 39:38.076
My dad knew Nicky was alive.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.911
Why would he lie to us?

39:41.046 --> 39:43.114
Well, there's a return address.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.618
Bradford, Pennsylvania.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.821
You think he's still there?

39:51.923 --> 39:56.294
I wonder what my father
would think about this.

39:56.327 --> 39:59.230
About me running.

39:59.264 --> 40:02.233
About me having found you.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.069
About all of it.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.137
There's so much
he didn't get to see.

40:06.171 --> 40:07.973
KATE: So, our son
is officially the size

40:08.006 --> 40:09.307
of a tomato.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.976
Uh, to-mah-to, please.

40:11.009 --> 40:11.977
It's classier.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.411
And our son is gonna be...

40:13.445 --> 40:14.480
:
classy as hell.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.715
Ooh. 'Kay.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.051
RANDALL: So much stuff
he never got to share in.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.887
You sure you don't want
to go find your brother's name

40:21.920 --> 40:23.254
on the wall?

40:25.090 --> 40:27.058
No.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.628
No, too sad for me.

40:29.661 --> 40:34.065
RANDALL: Sometimes I feel like
this big ol' puppet, you know?

40:34.099 --> 40:37.135
He's just pulling the strings
from up there,

40:37.168 --> 40:41.573
just tugging me around
wherever he wants me to go.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.011
I don't know.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.083
I think back
on all these moments

40:52.117 --> 40:55.821
and all these memories,

40:55.854 --> 41:00.626
and sometimes it feels like
there's been a plan for my life.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.696
Like, from the beginning.

41:07.365 --> 41:11.436
Maybe everyone feels that way.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.272
Maybe I'm not that special,

41:14.305 --> 41:17.275
and this is just what it is
to be a person,

41:17.308 --> 41:19.210
you know?

41:22.881 --> 41:25.350
You're very special, babe.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.786
Thank you.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.455
You're also very tired.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.710
Hello?

41:52.844 --> 41:55.413
Yeah, no, of course.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.422
Thanks for letting me know.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.862
*

42:22.708 --> 42:24.876
I won.
