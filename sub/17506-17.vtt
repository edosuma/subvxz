WEBVTT

00:00.374 --> 00:01.216
Hey, honey.

00:01.341 --> 00:03.511
For Amy's birthday party,
we're just gonna invite

00:03.636 --> 00:05.280
the people that are in our
play group, right?

00:05.405 --> 00:06.564
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, good.

00:06.689 --> 00:08.300
Except for Carson,
'cause he's a biter.

00:08.466 --> 00:09.484
Oh, yeah.

00:09.609 --> 00:10.928
And his mom 'cause she's a bitch.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.888
Totally, those two really
deserve each other, don't they?

00:13.054 --> 00:14.161
Oh, I love this one.

00:14.286 --> 00:15.140
Wait a minute.

00:15.306 --> 00:16.725
Sweetie, for Amy's first word,

00:16.891 --> 00:18.159
you put down "Dada."

00:18.284 --> 00:20.103
Oh, yeah, whatever.

00:20.269 --> 00:21.096
No, not whatever, Chris.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.230
Her first word was "mama."

00:22.355 --> 00:23.565
Remember, I came home from work,

00:23.690 --> 00:25.776
she put her arms out towards me.
She said, "mama."

00:25.942 --> 00:27.068
In the mama ballpark.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.303
I'll give you that, but...

00:28.428 --> 00:30.447
I thought that if we
were gonna count that...

00:30.613 --> 00:31.949
Which we are.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.708
Then she did say Dada
to me at the playground

00:33.833 --> 00:34.701
a couple of days before that.

00:34.867 --> 00:36.478
Very convenient that I was not

00:36.603 --> 00:38.372
there to witness said Dada.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.457
Well, luckily, I got it on video.

00:40.623 --> 00:44.336
Notice the timestamp.
It's great.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.504
That could be altered.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.554
You're a little paranoid.

00:46.679 --> 00:48.340
Shows you're nervous.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.299
Wait for it, here it comes.

00:49.465 --> 00:50.725
And...

00:50.850 --> 00:52.803
- Da.
- Boom.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.329
Dude, she wasn't even looking at you.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.390
She was probably pointing at a slide.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.266
So no Dada.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.477
Mama, first word.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.153
- Say Dada.
- Say mama.

01:04.278 --> 01:05.540
- Say Dada.
- Say mama.

01:05.665 --> 01:06.923
- Dada.
- Say mama.

01:07.048 --> 01:08.527
Amy, say mama, ma-ma.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.945
- Dada. Say Dada.
- Mama.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.118
She just said kia.

01:17.285 --> 01:17.995
Is that something?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.220
Something?
That's a car.

01:19.345 --> 01:20.288
She knows about cars!

01:20.454 --> 01:22.916
I think she said kiosk.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.376
From when we got the phone
covers in the mall!

01:24.542 --> 01:26.003
- At the mall!
- Yes!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.195
For her first birthday!

01:27.320 --> 01:28.672
- She's a genius!
- She's a genius.

Wanna go in?
Go in there?

01:49.842 --> 01:51.619
Hey, honey.

01:51.744 --> 01:53.120
Really, you're gonna bring
the chicken suit

01:53.245 --> 01:54.122
to a play date, honey?

01:54.247 --> 01:55.240
Isn't that a little much?

01:55.406 --> 01:56.324
Babe, I don't think you're

01:56.449 --> 01:58.535
fully aware of my play date persona.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.678
I'm freewheelin'.

02:00.803 --> 02:02.456
Just a good time Charlie.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.098
Ah, the kids love it.

02:04.223 --> 02:05.834
But, parents love it too, so...

02:06.000 --> 02:08.570
Nah, I think maybe
one parent loves it.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.294
You.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.381
Mama.

02:11.547 --> 02:15.510
Oh, honey, now we're
just rubbing it in.

02:15.676 --> 02:17.111
You know what,
she's kind of chatty today.

02:17.236 --> 02:18.236
I think I'm gonna get
the video camera.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.981
Okay.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.975
Hey, let's get a couple
dadas in there, huh?

02:22.141 --> 02:23.935
- Hey there, neighbor.
- Hey.

02:24.101 --> 02:25.145
- Hey.
- Headed out?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.789
Um, I... yes, I am headed...

02:27.914 --> 02:31.735
I'm just, um, just waiting
for Reagan to...

02:34.362 --> 02:36.198
- How are you guys doing?
- Great!

02:36.364 --> 02:38.666
We, uh, hadn't gotten our invitation

02:38.791 --> 02:41.703
to Amy's birthday party yet...

02:41.869 --> 02:45.273
Oh, yeah, you know,
we hadn't really decided

02:45.398 --> 02:47.167
what we were gonna do yet, so...

02:47.333 --> 02:48.585
That's what we were hoping you'd say!

02:49.235 --> 02:51.213
How'd you like to have a joint party?

02:51.379 --> 02:52.881
For our young ones?

02:54.257 --> 02:55.509
Reagan, honey?

02:55.675 --> 02:56.651
Could really use some...

02:56.776 --> 02:57.986
We could share entertainment,

02:58.111 --> 03:00.112
decorations, a bounce house,

03:00.680 --> 03:01.932
the whole kit and caboodle.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.057
Not that it's about money.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.059
Oh, tell that to our forever-off ac.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.161
We'd just love to share that

03:07.286 --> 03:08.814
special day with your family.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.799
Look, I...

03:11.924 --> 03:14.669
Um...

03:14.794 --> 03:15.821
Fine, yes.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.872
Hooray!

03:17.997 --> 03:20.534
So, uh, what do you say we
take care of the food and drinks

03:20.700 --> 03:22.160
and, uh, we have
the party at your place?

03:22.326 --> 03:25.497
It's like you always say, your
house has the primo party flow.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.457
Ah, God, I do always say that.

03:27.623 --> 03:29.100
♪ joint birthday party!

03:29.225 --> 03:31.253
♪ Joint birthday party!

03:31.419 --> 03:32.487
♪ Joint birthday party!

03:32.612 --> 03:33.713
What are they chanting about?

03:33.879 --> 03:36.299
I may have just agreed to hosting

03:36.549 --> 03:39.386
a joint birthday party for
Amy and Roger at our house.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.445
Chris, oh, my God!

03:40.570 --> 03:42.080
I was gone, like, 30 seconds.

03:42.205 --> 03:43.140
They ambushed me, babe.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.449
I need you to be the hammer

03:44.574 --> 03:46.534
in situations like that,
and they just...

03:46.659 --> 03:48.061
I'm just a get-along guy.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.872
We're gonna reserve a clown, okay?

03:49.997 --> 03:50.730
- Sure.
- No.

03:50.896 --> 03:51.648
They're in!

03:52.098 --> 03:53.525
Christopher!

03:53.691 --> 03:55.126
There.

03:55.251 --> 03:56.111
Hey, ladies.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.904
- There's daddy.
- Hi.

03:58.070 --> 03:59.747
- Daddy's here.
- Hi.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.158
What are you doing here?

04:01.324 --> 04:02.850
Yeah, just handing out
some invitations

04:02.975 --> 04:04.744
to some of my playground peeps.

04:04.910 --> 04:05.803
We'll see who's gonna make the cut.

04:05.928 --> 04:06.971
There he is, Kenny.

04:07.096 --> 04:08.389
Congratulations, buddy, you made it.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.292
And, hey, Brendan.
'Sup, dude?

04:10.458 --> 04:11.976
Brendan did not make the cut,

04:12.101 --> 04:13.503
so just be cool.

04:13.669 --> 04:14.662
Hey, can I ask you a question?

04:14.787 --> 04:15.997
Are you going
to invite Finn over there

04:16.122 --> 04:17.464
and his... daddy?

04:17.630 --> 04:19.259
'Cause I've seen you two chatting.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.070
Oh, Ned, yeah, Ned's a good guy.

04:22.195 --> 04:22.929
Aww...

04:23.412 --> 04:24.931
Nice daddies.

04:25.097 --> 04:28.626
Cute... nice... daddies.

04:28.751 --> 04:30.211
Listen, this is totally awkward,

04:30.336 --> 04:31.829
but, could I ask you a favor?

04:31.954 --> 04:33.356
Would you be able to introduce us?

04:33.522 --> 04:36.417
Because I think we've kind of
been making eyes at each other,

04:36.542 --> 04:40.054
and... I know he's recently
divorced and, you know,

04:40.179 --> 04:43.033
I haven't been on a date
in a long time, 22 months.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.159
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.286
Yowza.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.762
Nancy's a little antsy in the pantsy,

04:47.887 --> 04:49.247
if you know what I'm saying.

04:49.413 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, so it can definitely be
a wham, bam, thank you ma'am

04:52.125 --> 04:53.334
type of situation.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.587
One-pump chump, two-beat treat.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.131
You know, this is very weird
playground conversation.

04:58.297 --> 04:59.674
What do you say, Chris,
you think you can help me?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.509
Whatever it takes to just end this.

05:01.675 --> 05:04.262
- Oh, Chris, Chris, Chris!
- Okay.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.034
Oh, my God, what is...

05:10.159 --> 05:11.452
Honey, this is, like,

05:11.577 --> 05:13.588
90% Gene and Terry people here.

05:13.713 --> 05:14.622
Yeah, no kidding.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.290
Hey, guys, guys.

05:16.415 --> 05:17.325
I thought that we
agreed that you were

05:17.450 --> 05:19.152
- only gonna be inviting family.
- Yeah.

05:19.318 --> 05:20.403
This is just family.

05:20.569 --> 05:22.030
Between my side and Terry's,

05:22.196 --> 05:24.950
birthday boy's got, oh,
eight great-grandparents,

05:25.116 --> 05:28.519
four grandparents, two parents,
uh, eight uncles,

05:28.644 --> 05:31.039
six aunts and, uh, more cousins
than we can count.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.333
Our family loves making babies.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.043
And then we don't die!

05:37.019 --> 05:39.256
Oh, Roy, how are you?

05:39.422 --> 05:40.281
Oh, my God.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.949
Oh, look at this old-timer.

05:42.074 --> 05:43.484
Not caring for the feet.

05:43.609 --> 05:45.386
His shoe is touching the cheese.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.370
I can't take it anymore, honey.

05:46.495 --> 05:47.371
I have to go say something.

05:47.496 --> 05:48.949
- Brinkleys!
- Yeah?

05:49.074 --> 05:50.850
Oh... oh, Ava, wow.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.018
Very fancy.

05:52.184 --> 05:53.544
Christopher.

05:53.669 --> 05:54.938
Your wife's right here.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.983
Of course I'm gonna bring it
on such a special day for us!

05:58.149 --> 06:02.503
Missy is almost finished putting
out the classy appetizers

06:02.628 --> 06:06.199
for our v.I.P.S, a.K.A. Amy's guests.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.676
Missy has been given
very strict instructions

06:08.801 --> 06:11.746
not to serve any of
the Gene and Terry people.

06:11.912 --> 06:13.707
Missy, what are our red flags again?

06:13.873 --> 06:16.617
Pleated khakis,
polar performance fleeces,

06:16.742 --> 06:18.770
denim shirts with
looney tune characters.

06:18.895 --> 06:21.689
That's right, the off-brand
guests can help themselves

06:21.814 --> 06:23.883
to their best value potato
discs and diet Dr. Popper.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.469
- Okay.
- My meal is just the beginning.

06:26.635 --> 06:29.806
I cannot wait for the two
of you to open Amy's gift.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.766
Please, honey, don't go
too crazy, okay?

06:31.932 --> 06:32.950
Or crazy at all.

06:33.075 --> 06:33.935
That's an option.

06:34.101 --> 06:36.604
I am taking this very seriously.

06:36.770 --> 06:38.039
I mean, you may be the parents,

06:38.164 --> 06:39.257
which is very important, of course.

06:39.382 --> 06:41.476
But I am the godparent.

06:41.601 --> 06:42.694
God.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.612
What is he doing with Sushi?

06:44.778 --> 06:47.365
Missy, we have a breach!

06:47.531 --> 06:49.433
Why does Ava think she's
the godmother, honey?

06:49.558 --> 06:52.136
I mean, your sister's the godmother.

06:52.261 --> 06:53.997
Oh, you know what must have happened?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.666
Well, uh, both my girls
are doing great.

06:56.832 --> 06:57.667
All right, I love you.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.044
I'm Amy's godmother, right?

06:59.210 --> 07:00.695
Yes.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.263
Chris!

07:02.388 --> 07:04.198
Oh, my God.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.800
I'm sorry, I hadn't slept.

07:05.966 --> 07:06.968
I just... I just assumed that

07:07.093 --> 07:08.602
at some point that Ava
would bring it up to you

07:08.727 --> 07:09.770
and that you would set her straight.

07:09.895 --> 07:11.639
Like, now-ish.

07:11.805 --> 07:13.541
You need to learn
how to say no, Chris.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.559
No.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.077
Hey, look, I'm a people pleaser.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.812
It's what I bring
to our relationship.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.022
The chill factor.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.149
You know why you get
to bring the chill factor?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.610
Which, by the way, that stinks.

07:23.776 --> 07:24.903
Agreed.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.087
Is because you always know
that I will be there

07:26.212 --> 07:27.088
to say no for you.

07:27.213 --> 07:29.056
I always have to be the bad cop.

07:29.181 --> 07:30.408
You gotta admit, you're good at it.

07:30.574 --> 07:31.759
I'm sick of it.

07:31.884 --> 07:32.994
You need to be the bad cop
every once in a while.

07:33.119 --> 07:33.995
And you can start

07:34.120 --> 07:35.029
by going and telling her

07:35.154 --> 07:36.998
that she is not the godmother.

07:37.164 --> 07:38.199
Listen, why tell her?

07:38.324 --> 07:39.300
The issue only ever comes up

07:39.425 --> 07:40.401
if you and I die at the same time.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.402
And let's face it.

07:41.527 --> 07:42.403
If you and I go together,

07:42.528 --> 07:43.804
in all likelihood, Ava will have

07:43.929 --> 07:46.132
died with us or she'll have been
the one who killed us.

07:46.298 --> 07:51.179
No, you are gonna go tell her,
because until you step up,

07:51.345 --> 07:52.138
I'm out.

07:52.304 --> 07:53.556
- Out?
- Starting now.

07:53.722 --> 07:55.016
Right now, I'm just gonna...

07:55.141 --> 07:56.317
I'm just gonna enjoy this party.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.085
I'm just gonna go with the flow.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.814
Things get messy, prissy Chrissy
can get his hands dirty.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.733
Prissy Chri... wow, that just
rolled off your tongue.

08:03.899 --> 08:05.902
Excuse me.

08:06.068 --> 08:06.994
Hi, there, sir.

08:07.119 --> 08:07.987
Welcome to our home.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.430
Why don't you just feel free to

08:09.555 --> 08:10.789
kick those shoes off over there.

08:16.685 --> 08:17.775
{pub}- Hey.
- Hi.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.422
Yeah, we're just having a little

08:19.547 --> 08:21.209
funny face contest over there.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.336
- I'm totally winning.
- Are you?

08:23.502 --> 08:27.028
Hey, listen, one of the Gene and
Terrys is watching TV inside.

08:27.153 --> 08:28.260
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:28.385 --> 08:30.485
Yeah, at a birthday party, so...

08:30.610 --> 08:32.597
Oh, you know what, I'm fine, honey.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.399
But, you kn... if it's
bothering you, then,

08:34.524 --> 08:35.932
you gotta do something about it.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.135
- Hey.
- Thanks.

08:38.260 --> 08:39.136
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

08:39.261 --> 08:40.639
Listen, um, sorry about

08:40.764 --> 08:42.212
the whole Nancy thing...

08:42.337 --> 08:43.692
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:43.817 --> 08:45.177
We went out last night.

08:45.302 --> 08:46.394
It was amazing, really.

08:46.519 --> 08:48.319
I mean, she is so beautiful

08:48.485 --> 08:51.030
and she's vulnerable and sweet.

08:51.196 --> 08:52.073
So thank you.

08:52.239 --> 08:53.218
Really.

08:53.343 --> 08:54.352
Oh, gosh, that's great, man.

08:54.477 --> 08:55.353
You're welcome, buddy.

08:55.478 --> 08:57.072
That's... that's ra... that...

08:57.197 --> 08:59.791
Oh... that's a deep hug, man.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.576
All right, good news.

09:01.701 --> 09:03.668
- Hey... whoa.
- You gotta get Ned off my jock.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.130
Wait, what?
I thought it went great.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.129
Oh, no, it totally did.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.382
I mean, I got what I needed.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.417
He got the job done,
if you know what I mean.

09:09.542 --> 09:10.758
- Yeah, I do.
- I mean, he got his.

09:10.924 --> 09:12.218
Then I got mine.

09:12.384 --> 09:14.422
Look, I'm glad that
you both got... yours.

09:14.547 --> 09:15.555
But then he wouldn't leave.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.391
He stayed until lunchtime,
just wanting to chat.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.101
And then he made tea.

09:20.267 --> 09:22.896
So listen, Chris, I need you
to talk to him for me, please.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.939
Oh, jeez, Nancy, I don't know.

09:25.105 --> 09:26.651
Reagan, honey, do you
have a take on this?

09:26.776 --> 09:28.359
I do not.

09:30.027 --> 09:34.032
Cannot wait for you guys to
open Amy's present any longer!

09:34.198 --> 09:36.127
Amy.

09:36.252 --> 09:37.327
<i>Familia.</i>

09:37.493 --> 09:38.396
Becoming a godmother

09:38.521 --> 09:40.999
has been so meaningful for me.

09:41.124 --> 09:42.867
It's... it's got me going to
church again.

09:42.992 --> 09:44.417
Well, not "going" going.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.919
I just have a spiritualist come
to the house once a week

09:46.085 --> 09:47.879
and we pray together and then
he gives me a massage.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.340
Enough of me.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.509
May I present to you...

09:52.675 --> 09:54.719
Amy.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.049
Isn't she glorious?

09:58.174 --> 09:59.267
I had it commissioned

09:59.392 --> 10:03.228
by famed Neo-Victorian painter,
Daniel Beauregand.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.354
He doesn't usually do babies.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.396
No kidding.

10:05.562 --> 10:07.565
The question now is where to hang it.

10:07.731 --> 10:08.893
Maybe not even here.

10:09.018 --> 10:11.236
I mean, uh, maybe, a museum, perhaps?

10:11.402 --> 10:12.654
Like the Getty.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.132
Or that's probably too close,
maybe, like, uh,

10:14.257 --> 10:18.236
a east coast... museum or just,
like, Bermuda would be good.

10:18.361 --> 10:20.705
No, this is my goddaughter
we're talking about.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.873
It has got to be someplace
here, prominent.

10:24.039 --> 10:27.418
I think that it should
go above the fireplace.

10:27.584 --> 10:29.088
I do.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.950
That way, we can see it
all the time and...

10:32.075 --> 10:34.300
It can see us.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.886
I mean, of course, unless you
have a problem with that, honey?

10:38.848 --> 10:40.056
No, I do not, honey.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.060
Yes!

10:42.185 --> 10:43.643
I'm gonna go get my camera,

10:43.809 --> 10:45.019
and then I want to
take a picture of Amy.

10:45.185 --> 10:46.479
Be right back.

10:46.806 --> 10:49.517
It's one of those ones
where the eyes follow you...

10:49.642 --> 10:50.769
Wherever you...

10:50.894 --> 10:55.113
Yeah, I think I just saw it
lick its lips.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.990
Oh, look at this, huh?

10:57.156 --> 10:59.027
Ooh.

10:59.152 --> 11:01.160
- What's going on over here?
- Check it out.

11:01.326 --> 11:04.640
This total Gene and Terry lady,
she's doing her laundry here.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.335
Yeah, she claimed that her kid
had a real blow-out diaper,

11:07.460 --> 11:09.168
which were her words.

11:09.334 --> 11:11.379
Oh, don't smile about...
It's making you crazy.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.624
You know what?

11:12.749 --> 11:15.466
I think that we are seeing
the real Chris here.

11:15.632 --> 11:16.884
What do you mean?

11:17.050 --> 11:20.498
Yeah, maybe this, like,
cool, take-it-easy dude,

11:20.623 --> 11:23.601
maybe he only exists because
I have always been the reactor

11:23.726 --> 11:25.560
in the family, and I've
kept the heat off of you.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.895
Maybe all these years,
I have allowed you

11:28.061 --> 11:29.564
to think that you're
someone that you're not.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.940
No, no, no, no.

11:31.106 --> 11:32.360
I think that now that I'm making you

11:32.485 --> 11:33.511
deal with all this stuff,

11:33.636 --> 11:35.111
we're seeing the real you, honey.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.149
And the real you looks
a lot like this.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.410
Oh, no.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.788
Hey, it's time to sing
the birthday song

11:43.913 --> 11:45.330

and the birthday girl.

11:52.544 --> 11:54.198

Happy Birthday twice.

11:54.323 --> 11:55.366
Once for each kid.

11:55.491 --> 11:57.967
That's fine, honey, it's fine.

Her party dress is ruined.

12:33.126 --> 12:34.706
She wore it one time, boom.

All because we had to eat

12:35.999 --> 12:37.075
that garbage people
sheet cake out there.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.218
Oh, Chris, will you calm down?

12:40.384 --> 12:42.178
Are you kidding?

12:42.344 --> 12:43.998
Has society broken down?

Sir?

12:46.142 --> 12:46.974
Oh, now.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.720
Did you hear the bad news?

12:48.845 --> 12:49.888
It's okay, Ter.

12:50.013 --> 12:52.730
Guys, Yoinks the clown didn't show.

12:52.896 --> 12:54.774
The kids are so sad.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.261
Roger's only gonna turn one once.

12:56.386 --> 12:58.096
I wanted to be there
for his first clown.

12:58.221 --> 13:00.265
- It's gonna be okay.
- For you!

13:00.390 --> 13:02.323
All you care about is getting
your deposit back.

13:02.489 --> 13:04.702
My father was a depression baby!

13:04.827 --> 13:06.187
Oh, you have an old-ass father.

13:06.312 --> 13:07.787
- Big deal.
- Wh...

13:07.953 --> 13:09.741
Our daughter's
first birthday is ruined.

13:09.866 --> 13:11.666
We're never getting this back.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.168
You know what?
I got this covered.

13:14.334 --> 13:17.322
Here you go.
Excuse me.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.718
Chris, hey.
I've been looking for you.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.855
Um, so I'm getting, like, uh,

13:23.980 --> 13:25.638
mixed signals from Nancy.

13:25.804 --> 13:30.810
For the first time since Betsy
left, I felt alive last night,

13:30.976 --> 13:32.997
and it's not just
'cause of the love-making.

13:33.122 --> 13:34.199
Was it not?

13:34.324 --> 13:36.482
It's the tenderness and the spooning.

13:36.648 --> 13:38.102
Listen, uh, as much as I love

13:38.227 --> 13:39.938
to hear about other dudes spooning,

13:40.063 --> 13:41.487
I gotta level with you here, Ned.

13:41.653 --> 13:42.697
Oh, God.

No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No, no, no.

- No... d-don't.

13:45.157 --> 13:45.908
Please... please don't, please don't.

13:46.074 --> 13:47.744
- Please don't, no, no, no.
- No. Ohh!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.454
Don't you cry while
I'm holding a baby.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.456
- Look at me, right here.
- I'm stupid.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.700
It's good, it's great.

13:52.825 --> 13:55.153
She had the best time
of her life, she said.

13:55.278 --> 13:56.210
Yeah?

13:56.376 --> 13:58.907
So just be happy and congratulations

13:59.032 --> 14:00.792

Chris, you're such a sweetheart.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.241
I think that's why I went to
you to ask to be the godmother

16:31.366 --> 16:33.284
instead of going to Reagan.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.994
Because I knew you would
want someone else.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.012
Oh, honey.

16:36.137 --> 16:39.415
Someone dependable and stable

16:39.540 --> 16:42.419
and not "unfairly
maligned in the tabloids"

16:42.544 --> 16:46.213
for "trying to run over
Deion Sanders."

16:46.379 --> 16:48.507
I'm assuming your sister's
a different kind of gal?

16:48.673 --> 16:49.842
Yeah, she is.

16:50.008 --> 16:50.968
She sounds boring.

16:51.134 --> 16:53.429
Well, no, I mean, she's my sis... yeah.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.815
Let's face it.

16:54.940 --> 16:56.666
I'm never gonna have a baby.

16:56.791 --> 17:00.403
And when Amy was born,
I... I just thought

17:00.528 --> 17:04.022
being godmother would be
the next best thing.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.575
Sweetie, that's just a title.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.778
I mean, who's more important, really?

17:07.903 --> 17:09.794
You're the one who's here every day.

17:09.919 --> 17:11.832
You're babysitting,
you're catering parties,

17:11.957 --> 17:15.452
- you're commissioning... art.
- Art.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.795
And my sister, she lives on
the other side of the country.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.689
- Yeah.
- I mean, she hasn't seen Amy

17:19.814 --> 17:21.082
since she was, like, two months old.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.458
She might be the godmother,

17:22.583 --> 17:27.755
but, come on, you are
special auntie Ava.

17:27.921 --> 17:32.426
Aww, you guys.

17:32.592 --> 17:33.770
Yep.

17:33.895 --> 17:35.021
Group hug.

17:35.146 --> 17:37.014
- Okay. Oh!
- Ooh!

17:37.180 --> 17:37.824
- Okay.
- I can't quite...

17:37.949 --> 17:39.159
- Oh, boy, there you go.
- Whoa.

17:39.284 --> 17:40.476
Come on back up.
There we go, let's get a hug.

17:40.601 --> 17:44.414
- Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, you guys, there it is.

17:44.539 --> 17:46.333
Yeah, sweetie, that's my boob.

17:46.458 --> 17:50.361
Aww, special auntie Ava.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.489
Well, then, special auntie Ava,

17:52.614 --> 17:53.757
I think that there might be

17:53.882 --> 17:54.991
a little birthday girl in there

17:55.116 --> 17:57.243
who is due for a diaper change.

17:57.409 --> 18:01.038
Ugh, is she still doing that?

18:01.204 --> 18:02.766
I'm just kidding.

18:02.891 --> 18:05.418
What is it, a pee-pee?

18:05.584 --> 18:06.669
Who knows?

18:06.835 --> 18:10.840
Either way, I love that girl.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.968
- I love changing diapers.
- Okay.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.678
- Yeah, cool.
- Sorry, kids.

18:17.656 --> 18:20.016
Babe.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.017
Yeah.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.852
- It's after 6:00.
- Huh?

18:23.018 --> 18:24.520
Those people are still
hunkering down up there.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.755
Oh, God.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.290
All right, that's it.
Nope, that's it.

18:27.415 --> 18:28.358
All right, it's enough.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.726
I'm gonna go crack some skulls.

18:29.851 --> 18:32.528
No, no, no.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.612
I got this.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.032
Okay, everybody, time to go.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.950
Yeah, sorry.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.452
Loved having you,
but the party's over.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.371
Oh, but Chris, come on,
we're having so much fun.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.538
Everyone's having so much fun.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.415
Fluff and fold, forget it, okay?

18:44.581 --> 18:48.169
Hey, old man foot cheese,
we're done, all right?

18:48.335 --> 18:50.546
Yeah, and...
and bedroom/bathroom guy <i>adios.</i>

18:50.712 --> 18:52.089
And take the magazine with you.

18:52.255 --> 18:54.175
Nancy, honey, I love you.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.677
Ned brews tea and he likes to spoon.

18:56.843 --> 18:58.888
I suggest that you try
to make this one work.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.190
Okay, bye, everybody.
Bye.

19:00.315 --> 19:01.599
Let's keep
the good-bye train rolling.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.350
Thank you, bye, bye.
That's ours.

19:03.516 --> 19:05.144
Yeah, down and out.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.163
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

19:07.288 --> 19:09.432
Thank you guys so much for hosting.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.284
- This was amazing.
- Yeah.

19:11.409 --> 19:12.619
Hey, never too early
to start planning

19:12.744 --> 19:14.236
for birthday party <i>numero dos!</i>

19:14.402 --> 19:15.529
Nope.

19:15.695 --> 19:16.506
You guys.

19:16.631 --> 19:17.990
The Brinkleys, you're nuts.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.492
Not gonna happen.

19:21.826 --> 19:22.995
We're not going to do that.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.248
We're laughing,

19:25.373 --> 19:28.084
but we're saying "no," and it's real.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.352
It isn't either.

19:29.477 --> 19:30.419
You're just too much.

19:30.585 --> 19:31.939
This was a horrible mistake.

19:32.064 --> 19:33.423
- Okay.
- Dudes!

19:33.548 --> 19:36.359
One of the worst experiences
of our life, if not the worst.

19:36.484 --> 19:37.426
Okay?

19:37.592 --> 19:39.929
There we go, and...

19:40.095 --> 19:42.723
- Wow, did that feel good.
- Doesn't it, though?

19:42.889 --> 19:45.017
Just to say no.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.435
Yeah, I'm loving it.
Just "no."

19:46.601 --> 19:48.062
- No.
- No!

19:48.228 --> 19:49.823
No, no, no, no, no.

19:49.948 --> 19:52.316
Am I your special auntie Ava?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.713
- Yeah? Auntie Ava...
- Ava.

19:56.838 --> 19:57.914
She said Ava.

19:58.039 --> 20:00.074
Amy said Ava.
Oh, my God!

20:00.240 --> 20:02.285
Is that her first word?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.553
Yes.

20:03.678 --> 20:04.554
- Yes.
- Yep.

20:04.679 --> 20:05.955
Say it again, sweetie, say Ava.

20:06.080 --> 20:06.997
Ava.

20:07.163 --> 20:08.249
- Ava
- Ava.

20:10.852 --> 20:11.978
Oh!

20:12.103 --> 20:13.754
Guys, it's so great
to see you so happy.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.423
- I am so happy.
- Yay.

20:16.589 --> 20:19.593
Listen, we're not gonna keep
that painting, okay?

20:19.759 --> 20:20.886
- What painting?
- Oh, good.

20:21.052 --> 20:22.822
Honey, this way.

20:22.947 --> 20:25.949
Ava.
Ava.

20:29.144 --> 20:30.462
{pub}Oh, sweet girl.

20:30.587 --> 20:32.565
Happy Birthday.
Mwah!

20:32.731 --> 20:35.892
I just wanna tell you
that this last year

20:36.017 --> 20:39.280
has been the very best year
of our lives.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.948
Hmm.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.449
Do you wanna bounce?

20:42.615 --> 20:44.368
Do you wanna bounce?

20:44.534 --> 20:46.035
Do you wanna bounce?

20:46.160 --> 20:48.855
Bouncy, bouncy,
bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.833
Oh, jeez, what...

20:50.999 --> 20:52.542
Really? What, do they
think that we can't see them?

20:52.667 --> 20:54.670
Are you kidding?
They want us to see them.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.628
Oh, gross.

20:55.753 --> 20:57.013
- Oh, Nancy.
- Okay, don't... no.

20:57.138 --> 20:59.466
- Amy, don't look.
- Amy, look over here.
