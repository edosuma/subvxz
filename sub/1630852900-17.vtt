00:33.500 --> 00:35.068
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.135 --> 00:37.937
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.004 --> 00:42.308
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.243
WE'RE BACK, AND NO TIME TO RECAP

00:43.309 --> 00:43.943
EVERYTHING WE'VE MISSED IN THE

00:44.010 --> 00:44.577
LAST MONTH, INCLUDING MULTIPLE

00:44.644 --> 00:45.812
WORLD LEADERS LOSING THEIR

00:45.879 --> 00:47.080
JOBS -- SOMETIMES AFTER MASS

00:47.147 --> 00:48.381
PROTEST, LIKE IN SRI LANKA, AND

00:48.448 --> 00:49.883
SOMETIMES AFTER MASS GOVERNMENT

00:49.949 --> 00:51.985
RESIGNATIONS, LIKE IN THE UK,

00:52.051 --> 00:53.186
WHERE BORIS JOHNSON FINALLY

00:53.253 --> 00:54.554
STEPPED DOWN IN DISGRACE,

00:54.621 --> 00:55.822
PROMPTING THIS MAGNIFICENT

00:55.889 --> 00:58.057
MAN-ON-THE-STREET INTERVIEW:

00:58.124 --> 00:58.925
>> EXCUSE ME, SIR, SORRY TO

00:58.992 --> 01:00.427
DISTURB.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.661
I'M FROM "BBC NEWSNIGHT," JUST

01:01.728 --> 01:02.695
WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK OF

01:02.762 --> 01:04.397
BORIS JOHNSON RESIGNING TODAY.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.832
>> I WANT HIM TO GO.

01:05.899 --> 01:09.068
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS.

01:09.135 --> 01:09.335
[LAUGHTER]

01:09.402 --> 01:10.537
>> John: EXCELLENT.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.371
I MEAN, DIRTBAG ENGLISH

01:11.438 --> 01:12.906
STANLEY TUCCI IS PERFECT.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.007
FROM NOW ON THAT MAN SHOULD BE

01:14.073 --> 01:15.141
ASKED FOR COMMENT ON EVERY MAJOR

01:15.208 --> 01:16.242
NEWS EVENT.

01:16.309 --> 01:17.343
IN FACT, PUT HIM ON

01:17.410 --> 01:19.112
"LOVE ISLAND" RIGHT NOW.

01:19.179 --> 01:19.946
I'M SO FUCKING SERIOUS ABOUT

01:20.013 --> 01:22.582
THIS.

01:22.649 --> 01:23.316
[APPLAUSE]

01:23.383 --> 01:24.150
A NEW BOMBSHELL HAS ENTERED THE

01:24.217 --> 01:25.151
VILLA.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.386
[LAUGHTER]

01:26.453 --> 01:27.687
MEANWHILE, HERE IN THE U.S., THE

01:27.754 --> 01:28.521
JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE HEARINGS

01:28.588 --> 01:29.823
HAVE BEEN CONTINUING, WITH THE

01:29.889 --> 01:31.558
LATEST TAKING PLACE ON THURSDAY,

01:31.624 --> 01:32.792
FEATURING SOME INTERESTING

01:32.859 --> 01:33.993
FOOTAGE OF JOSH HAWLEY, WHO YOU

01:34.060 --> 01:35.495
MAY REMEMBER RILED UP THE CROWD

01:35.562 --> 01:37.630
EARLIER IN THE DAY WITH A FIST

01:37.697 --> 01:38.932
OF SOLIDARITY, BUT WHO WE NOW

01:38.998 --> 01:40.967
KNOW WAS SEEN RUNNING FOR SAFETY

01:41.034 --> 01:43.169
AFTER THEY STORMED THE CAPITOL.

01:43.236 --> 01:43.837
[LAUGHTER]

01:43.903 --> 01:45.805
THAT IS PAINFULLY EMBARRASSING.

01:45.872 --> 01:47.340
THAT IS THE GAIT OF A MAN WHO'S

01:47.407 --> 01:48.308
EITHER JUST GASSED UP AN

01:48.374 --> 01:49.776
INSURRECTION THAT'S NOW BEARING

01:49.843 --> 01:51.144
DOWN ON TOP OF HIM, OR JUST

01:51.211 --> 01:52.545
DRANK A LARGE ICED COFFEE

01:52.612 --> 01:54.280
45 MINUTES AGO.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.616
EITHER WAY, THOSE LEGS SCREAM

01:56.683 --> 01:59.219
"I'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE."

01:59.285 --> 02:00.286
[LAUGHTER]

02:00.353 --> 02:01.688
BUT MAYBE THE BEST RESPONSE TO

02:01.754 --> 02:02.655
THAT CLIP CAME FROM FORMER DC

02:02.722 --> 02:04.057
POLICE OFFICER MICHAEL FANONE,

02:04.123 --> 02:04.791
WHO WAS INJURED IN THE RIOT, AND

02:04.858 --> 02:05.725
OFFERED THIS COMMENTARY OUTSIDE

02:05.792 --> 02:07.327
THE HEARING.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.429
>> THE FIRST THOUGHTS THAT

02:09.496 --> 02:10.163
POPPED INTO MY MIND WAS, JOSH

02:10.230 --> 02:12.332
HAWLEY IS A [BLEEP].

02:12.398 --> 02:15.602
AND HE RAN LIKE A [BLEEP].

02:15.668 --> 02:16.369
>> John: NOW, I WOULDN'T

02:16.436 --> 02:17.670
PERSONALLY SAY THAT.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.272
I'D SAY JOSH HAWLEY IS A BITCH

02:19.339 --> 02:20.607
WHO RAN LIKE A CHIHUAHUA

02:20.673 --> 02:21.608
DESPERATELY TRYING TO KEEP UP

02:21.674 --> 02:29.115
WITH ITS OWNER ON A CASUAL WALK.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.116
BUT YOU KNOW, TO EACH THEIR OWN.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.317
I'M SURE THERE'LL BE MORE TO SAY

02:31.384 --> 02:31.985
ABOUT THIS WHEN THE HEARINGS

02:32.051 --> 02:32.685
RESUME IN SEPTEMBER, BUT FOR

02:32.752 --> 02:33.520
NOW, WE'RE GOING TO DIVE

02:33.586 --> 02:34.621
STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY

02:34.687 --> 02:35.388
THIS WEEK, AS IT CONCERNS A

02:35.455 --> 02:35.889
TOPIC THAT'S BEEN AT THE

02:35.955 --> 02:36.789
FOREFRONT OF THE NEWS OVER THE

02:36.856 --> 02:37.524
PAST YEAR.

02:37.590 --> 02:38.892
>> TONIGHT, INFLATION NATION.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.527
INFLATION'S GRIP ON AMERICAN

02:40.593 --> 02:43.062
CONSUMERS NOT LETTING UP.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.697
>> IT'S CALLED LUNCH-FLATION.

02:44.764 --> 02:45.999
>> BOOZE-FLATION.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.800
>> MILK-FLATION.

02:47.867 --> 02:48.768
>> MEAT-FLATION IS ROCKING THE

02:48.835 --> 02:50.136
NATION.

02:50.203 --> 02:53.139
>> John: OKAY, FIRST: A BIG,

02:53.206 --> 02:54.407
ENTHUSIASTIC "NO" TO THE WORD

02:54.474 --> 02:55.608
"MEAT-FLATION," WHICH SOUNDS

02:55.675 --> 02:56.609
LESS LIKE AN ECONOMIC PHENOMENON

02:56.676 --> 02:57.277
AND MORE LIKE A SLANG TERM FOR A

02:57.343 --> 02:59.345
BONER.

02:59.412 --> 03:00.480
[LAUGHTER]

03:00.547 --> 03:01.714
IT'S HONESTLY HARD TO THINK OF A

03:01.781 --> 03:04.317
MORE UNPLEASANT PORTMANTEAU THAN

03:04.384 --> 03:04.918
MEATFLATION, ASIDE FROM "SNART,"

03:04.984 --> 03:05.652
WHICH COMBINES THE WORDS

03:05.718 --> 03:06.986
"SNEEZE" AND "FART."

03:07.053 --> 03:07.921
OR "RONZO," WHICH WOULD

03:07.987 --> 03:12.825
OBVIOUSLY BE THE CELEBRITY

03:12.892 --> 03:14.761
COUPLE NAME IF RON HOWARD EVER

03:14.827 --> 03:16.262
FUCKED GONZO THE MUPPET.

03:16.329 --> 03:17.196
AS YOU UNDOUBTEDLY KNOW, THE

03:17.263 --> 03:21.668
U.S. IS EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST

03:21.734 --> 03:22.635
INFLATION OF THE PAST 40 YEARS.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.303
AND DESPITE INITIAL HOPES IT'D

03:23.369 --> 03:23.937
BE TEMPORARY, PRICES ARE STILL

03:24.003 --> 03:25.271
GOING UP.

03:25.338 --> 03:33.079
OVER THE PAST YEAR, FOOD IS UP

03:33.146 --> 03:36.182
10.4%, AND GASOLINE IS UP 59.9%.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.050
SO, TO BE HONEST, IT'S PROBABLY

03:37.116 --> 03:37.784
A GOOD IDEA TO START MAKING YOUR

03:37.850 --> 03:38.685
GASOLINE AT HOME IN THE MORNING

03:38.751 --> 03:41.487
INSTEAD OF GETTING AN EXPENSIVE

03:41.554 --> 03:42.288
CUP OF IT ON YOUR WAY TO WORK.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.156
AND IN SOME CASES, COMPANIES

03:43.222 --> 03:44.591
HAVE TRIED TO HIDE INFLATION BY

03:44.657 --> 03:45.224
KEEPING THEIR PRICES THE SAME,

03:45.291 --> 03:45.925
BUT REDUCING THE SIZE OF THEIR

03:45.992 --> 03:47.093
PRODUCTS.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.294
IT'S CALLED "SHRINK-FLATION,"

03:48.361 --> 03:50.630
AND NEWS OUTLETS LOVE TO COVER

03:50.697 --> 03:52.332
THIS, USUALLY WITH THE HELP OF

03:52.398 --> 03:52.932
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE ONE GO-TO

03:52.999 --> 03:54.801
EXPERT ON THE TOPIC.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.704
>> THERE'S ALMOST NO CATEGORY OF

03:57.770 --> 03:59.005
PRODUCT EXCEPT EGGS, MAYBE, THAT

03:59.072 --> 04:00.773
HASN'T BEEN DOWNSIZED OVER THE

04:00.840 --> 04:04.544
PAST YEARS.

04:04.611 --> 04:08.281
>> CONSUMER ADVOCATE IS

04:08.348 --> 04:13.086
PUBLISHER OF MousePrint.org.

04:13.152 --> 04:13.886
>> CREST 3-D WHITE WENT FROM

04:13.953 --> 04:14.821
4.1 OUNCES TO 3.8 OUNCES.

04:14.887 --> 04:15.688
APPLE CINNAMON CHEERIOS WENT

04:15.755 --> 04:17.256
FROM 20.1 OUNCES TO 19 OUNCES.

04:17.323 --> 04:18.324
IT'S STILL CALLED FAMILY SIZE.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.125
THE FAMILY MUST'VE GOTTEN

04:19.192 --> 04:22.161
SMALLER.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.230
>> HERE YOU'VE GOT TWO BOTTLES

04:24.297 --> 04:25.098
OF GATORADE AND THESE HAVE JUST

04:25.164 --> 04:27.467
CHANGED IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.434
THIS ONE IS THE OLD 32-OUNCE

04:28.501 --> 04:31.504
ONE.

04:31.571 --> 04:32.805
THIS ONE IS FOUR OUNCES LESS.

04:32.872 --> 04:34.207
THEY SAID THEY MADE IT EASIER TO

04:34.273 --> 04:35.308
GRIP, YOU KNOW.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.077
GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:38.144 --> 04:41.047
[LAUGHTER]

04:41.114 --> 04:41.848
>> John: YEAH, YOU TELL 'EM, ED!

04:41.914 --> 04:42.849
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT

04:42.915 --> 04:44.150
MAN, FROM HIS WEBSITE,

04:44.217 --> 04:45.318
MousePrint.org -- WHICH IS

04:45.385 --> 04:46.386
SOMEHOW NOT AN ONLINE LITERARY

04:46.452 --> 04:47.887
JOURNAL FOR WRITERS WHO HAPPEN

04:47.954 --> 04:49.422
TO BE RODENTS -- TO HIS

04:49.489 --> 04:51.724
ELECTRIFYING DELIVERY OF THE

04:51.791 --> 04:53.292
WORD "EGGS," TO HIS UTTER

04:53.359 --> 04:54.927
REFUSAL TO TOLERATE EVEN THE

04:54.994 --> 04:55.495
SLIGHTEST AMOUNT OF BULLSHIT

04:55.561 --> 04:57.964
FROM GATORADE.

04:58.031 --> 04:58.998
[LAUGHTER]

04:59.065 --> 04:59.966
BUT WHETHER IT'S INFLATION,

05:00.033 --> 05:01.768
SHRINK-FLATION OR MEAT-FLATION,

05:01.834 --> 05:02.368
RISING PRICES ARE CLEARLY A

05:02.435 --> 05:03.770
PROBLEM.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.339
ALTHOUGH HOURLY EARNINGS WERE UP

05:06.406 --> 05:09.609
5.1% OVER THE PAST YEAR, OVERALL

05:09.676 --> 05:11.611
WAGES FELL BY 3.6% WHEN ADJUSTED

05:11.678 --> 05:13.446
FOR INFLATION.

05:13.513 --> 05:14.714
AND FOR THOSE ON FIXED INCOMES

05:14.781 --> 05:16.215
OR TIGHT BUDGETS, LIKE STUDENTS

05:16.282 --> 05:17.650
AND RETIREES, INFLATION IS

05:17.717 --> 05:18.985
ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE,

05:19.052 --> 05:19.686
AND CAN AMOUNT TO A LIFE

05:19.752 --> 05:22.121
OVERHAUL.

05:22.188 --> 05:23.823
>> PATTI BYTHER JUST UN-RETIRED

05:23.890 --> 05:25.091
AND GOT READY FOR HER NEW

05:25.158 --> 05:26.826
PART-TIME JOB.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.194
>> I THOUGHT I WAS DONE.

05:28.261 --> 05:28.995
I HAD WORKED IT ALL OUT

05:29.062 --> 05:29.595
FINANCIALLY THAT, YOU KNOW, I

05:29.662 --> 05:31.497
COULD AFFORD IT.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.466
>> WITH PRICES SOARING, HER

05:33.533 --> 05:34.934
RETIREMENT LASTED 10 MONTHS.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.903
>> THESE ARE MY FUEL BILLS.

05:36.969 --> 05:37.770
>> IN 13 MONTHS, IT WENT UP

05:37.837 --> 05:39.105
$150.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.873
>> CORRECT.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.375
MY SAFETY NET IS JUST GONE.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.443
>> WHEN DO YOU SEE YOURSELF

05:43.509 --> 05:45.144
RETIRING FOR REAL?

05:45.211 --> 05:46.279
>> I DON'T REALLY SEE A TIME

05:46.345 --> 05:48.481
WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO RETIRE

05:48.548 --> 05:50.249
AGAIN, OR ENTIRELY AGAIN, WHICH

05:50.316 --> 05:54.887
IS SORT OF ANNOYING AND SAD.

05:54.954 --> 05:56.489
>> John: THAT IS PUTTING IT

05:56.556 --> 05:57.457
LIGHTLY.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.624
IT MUST BE SO FRUSTRATING TO

05:58.691 --> 05:59.258
RETIRE, THINK YOU'RE DONE, AND

05:59.325 --> 06:01.027
THEN HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.628
THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE WORST CASE

06:02.695 --> 06:03.496
SCENARIO OF RETIREMENT -- OTHER

06:03.563 --> 06:04.330
THAN, OF COURSE, MOVING TO

06:04.397 --> 06:06.666
FLORIDA.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.767
[LAUGHTER]

06:07.834 --> 06:08.835
SO GIVEN THAT IT'S HURTING SO

06:08.901 --> 06:10.703
MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, TONIGHT,

06:10.770 --> 06:11.971
LET'S EXAMINE INFLATION: WHAT

06:12.038 --> 06:13.473
CAUSED IT, WHAT WE'VE DONE TO

06:13.539 --> 06:14.440
ADDRESS IT SO FAR, AND WHAT

06:14.507 --> 06:16.175
COULD HAPPEN NEXT.

06:16.242 --> 06:16.876
AND LET'S START WITH HOW EXACTLY

06:16.943 --> 06:18.478
WE GOT HERE.

06:18.544 --> 06:19.746
BECAUSE YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD A

06:19.812 --> 06:20.279
LOT OF EXPLANATIONS FLYING

06:20.346 --> 06:22.281
AROUND.

06:22.348 --> 06:23.850
>> THIS IS BIDEN-FLATION, A

06:23.916 --> 06:24.584
39-YEAR HIGH CREATED BY JOE

06:24.650 --> 06:25.752
BIDEN.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.086
>> MAKE NO MISTAKE.

06:27.153 --> 06:27.687
INFLATION IS LARGELY THE FAULT

06:27.754 --> 06:32.058
OF PUTIN.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.793
>> THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS THE

06:33.860 --> 06:34.994
CATALYST AT THE END OF THE DAY.

06:35.061 --> 06:35.928
>> INFLATION IS NOT CAUSED BY

06:35.995 --> 06:36.596
THE BUILD BACK BETTER OR THE

06:36.662 --> 06:37.497
BIPARTISAN BILL.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.265
IT'S CAUSED BY CORPORATE GREED.

06:39.332 --> 06:39.999
>> John: YEAH, THERE'S BEEN A

06:40.066 --> 06:41.100
FLURRY OF FINGER-POINTING.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.168
WITH MANY TENDING TO PLACE THE

06:42.235 --> 06:43.369
BLAME ON WHATEVER THEY WERE

06:43.436 --> 06:44.403
ALREADY MAD AT, WITH SOME

06:44.470 --> 06:45.838
DEMOCRATS BLAMING CORPORATE

06:45.905 --> 06:48.241
GREED, REPUBLICANS BLAMING JOE

06:48.307 --> 06:49.942
BIDEN, BIDEN BLAMING PUTIN, AND

06:50.009 --> 06:50.943
YOUR DOG PRESUMABLY BLAMING THE

06:51.010 --> 06:53.379
VACUUM CLEANER.

06:53.446 --> 06:54.547
[LAUGHTER]

06:54.614 --> 06:55.748
AND HERE'S THE INTERESTING

06:55.815 --> 06:56.783
THING: ASIDE FROM THE DOG,

06:56.849 --> 06:58.050
THEY'RE PROBABLY ALL AT LEAST A

06:58.117 --> 06:59.452
LITTLE BIT RIGHT, BECAUSE THE

06:59.519 --> 07:00.653
TRUTH IS: THERE IS NO ONE CAUSE

07:00.720 --> 07:02.555
OF INFLATION.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.891
AT THE BEST OF TIMES IT INVOLVES

07:04.957 --> 07:06.492
A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS, AND THE

07:06.559 --> 07:07.660
SITUATION WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW HAS

07:07.727 --> 07:08.261
BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED PERFECT

07:08.327 --> 07:10.830
STORM.

07:10.897 --> 07:12.231
AND TO UNDERSTAND THAT STORM, IT

07:12.298 --> 07:13.633
MIGHT HELP TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT

07:13.699 --> 07:14.567
TO TALK ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF

07:14.634 --> 07:17.270
INFLATION.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.871
VERY BASICALLY, IT HAPPENS

07:18.938 --> 07:19.505
WHENEVER THERE'S TOO MUCH DEMAND

07:19.572 --> 07:21.707
FOR TOO LITTLE SUPPLY.

07:21.774 --> 07:22.909
IF PEOPLE HAVE LOTS OF MONEY TO

07:22.975 --> 07:23.543
SPEND, THEY USUALLY WANT TO BUY

07:23.609 --> 07:24.944
MORE STUFF.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.379
BUT IF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STUFF

07:26.445 --> 07:27.613
TO GO AROUND, THEN THE PRICE OF

07:27.680 --> 07:29.448
THAT STUFF GOES UP.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.350
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE: LET'S

07:31.417 --> 07:32.185
SAY THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN

07:32.251 --> 07:33.486
AMERICA SUDDENLY WINS THE

07:33.553 --> 07:39.725
LOTTERY, AND EVERYONE NOW HAS

07:39.792 --> 07:41.160
$40 MILLION TO SPEND.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.128
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?

07:42.195 --> 07:43.062
WELL, I'D ASSUME THEY'D DO WHAT

07:43.129 --> 07:45.765
I WOULD, WHICH IS IMMEDIATELY

07:45.832 --> 07:46.599
BUY THIS $1,500 EMERALD PATINA

07:46.666 --> 07:47.667
FOUNTAIN STATUE OF A FROG

07:47.733 --> 07:48.768
SPREADING ITS UNNATURALLY LONG

07:48.835 --> 07:49.735
LEGS IN A MANNER THAT SEEMS

07:49.802 --> 07:50.770
OFFENSIVE, BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY

07:50.837 --> 07:52.939
SURE TO WHO.

07:53.005 --> 07:53.539
[LAUGHTER]

07:53.606 --> 07:55.074
BY THE WAY, THE FROG COMES IN

07:55.141 --> 07:57.677
TWO SIZES, LARGE AND GIANT.

07:57.743 --> 07:58.711
[LAUGHTER]

07:58.778 --> 07:59.846
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IF YOU WIN THE

07:59.912 --> 08:00.446
LOTTERY, YOU'RE SPRINGING FOR

08:00.513 --> 08:01.514
THE GIANT ONE.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.381
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM: THERE

08:02.448 --> 08:03.316
ARE CURRENTLY ONLY THREE OF THEM

08:03.382 --> 08:04.450
LEFT IN STOCK.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.818
SO THE STATUES ARE LIKELY TO GET

08:05.885 --> 08:07.753
MORE EXPENSIVE, BECAUSE EVERYONE

08:07.820 --> 08:09.488
SUDDENLY WANTS ONE, AS THEY ALL

08:09.555 --> 08:10.756
HAVE MORE MONEY TO SPEND, BUT

08:10.823 --> 08:17.063
THERE ARE ONLY THREE LEFT.

08:17.129 --> 08:20.132
BASICALLY, HIGH DEMAND, NOT

08:20.199 --> 08:22.168
ENOUGH SUPPLY, AND THAT'S HOW WE

08:22.235 --> 08:23.369
GET FROG-FLATION.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.237
SO, TOO MUCH MONEY CHASING A

08:24.303 --> 08:25.204
LIMITED SUPPLY OF GOODS CAN LEAD

08:25.271 --> 08:26.138
TO INFLATION.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.473
AND SOME ON THE RIGHT HAVE

08:27.540 --> 08:28.374
SEIZED ON THE "TOO MUCH MONEY"

08:28.441 --> 08:29.308
PART OF THAT IDEA TO SUGGEST

08:29.375 --> 08:30.076
THAT INFLATION IS REALLY JUST

08:30.142 --> 08:31.510
DOWN TO ONE THING:

08:31.577 --> 08:32.745
>> WHEN YOU PUT $6 TRILLION OF

08:32.812 --> 08:34.180
FISCAL STIMULUS INTO THE ECONOMY

08:34.247 --> 08:35.681
AS PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DEMOCRATS

08:35.748 --> 08:36.983
DID LAST YEAR, YOU'RE GOING TO

08:37.049 --> 08:39.018
END UP WITH BIG TIME INFLATION.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.219
>> THE MARCH STIMULUS PACKAGE

08:40.286 --> 08:40.820
LITERALLY MANUFACTURED

08:40.887 --> 08:42.722
INFLATION.

08:42.788 --> 08:43.522
>> THIS INFLATION IS CAUSED BY

08:43.589 --> 08:44.857
DEMOCRAT POLICIES.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.692
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN.

08:46.759 --> 08:47.560
THIS IS THE DEMOCRAT TAX ON THE

08:47.627 --> 08:48.527
MIDDLE CLASS.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.397
>> John: WOW.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.431
THAT'S SOME PRETTY HEAVY FIRE.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.500
CALLING SOMETHING A "TAX ON THE

08:54.567 --> 08:56.302
MIDDLE CLASS" IS ONE OF THE BEST

08:56.369 --> 08:57.870
WAYS TO MAKE IT LOOK BAD, JUST

08:57.937 --> 08:58.938
AFTER CALLING IT "A CLOSE

08:59.005 --> 09:01.674
ASSOCIATE OF PRINCE ANDREW."

09:01.741 --> 09:02.942
[LAUGHTER]

09:03.009 --> 09:03.943
BLAMING BIDEN'S STIMULUS PACKAGE

09:04.010 --> 09:04.744
HAS BECOME A COMMON REFRAIN ON

09:04.810 --> 09:05.645
THE RIGHT WHEN DISCUSSING

09:05.711 --> 09:07.013
INFLATION.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.582
AND THE REALITY IS, THERE IS A

09:09.649 --> 09:11.284
KERNEL OF TRUTH TO IT: THANKS TO

09:11.350 --> 09:12.418
THE PANDEMIC-ERA STIMULUS BILLS,

09:12.485 --> 09:13.185
PEOPLE DID HAVE MORE CASH ON

09:13.252 --> 09:16.555
HAND.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.757
BUT THAT IS NOT THE ONLY REASON.

09:17.823 --> 09:18.991
AS STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS, MANY

09:19.058 --> 09:19.992
PEOPLE SAVED MONEY DURING THE

09:20.059 --> 09:21.427
EARLY DAYS OF THE PANDEMIC,

09:21.494 --> 09:22.295
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WERE ALL STUCK

09:22.361 --> 09:23.763
AT HOME.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.932
BY ONE ESTIMATE, HOUSEHOLDS

09:25.998 --> 09:27.333
ACTUALLY ACCUMULATED $2.5

09:27.400 --> 09:28.334
TRILLION IN EXCESS SAVINGS

09:28.401 --> 09:30.736
DURING THE PANDEMIC.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.204
AND TO THE EXTENT PEOPLE WERE

09:32.271 --> 09:33.406
SPENDING MONEY, IT MOSTLY WASN'T

09:33.472 --> 09:34.340
ON SERVICES LIKE FLIGHTS OR

09:34.407 --> 09:36.542
HOTELS OR RESTAURANTS.

09:36.609 --> 09:39.779
INSTEAD, IT WENT TO GOODS LIKE

09:39.845 --> 09:40.880
FURNITURE, APPLIANCES, OR -- I

09:40.947 --> 09:41.814
DON'T KNOW -- SOME STEAMY

09:41.881 --> 09:44.283
WATERCOLOR RAT EROTICA.

09:44.350 --> 09:44.951
[LAUGHTER]

09:45.017 --> 09:46.285
I'M JUST DESCRIBING WHAT MOST

09:46.352 --> 09:48.387
PEOPLE DID IN 2020.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.822
AND WHAT'S MORE, THE NOTION THAT

09:49.889 --> 09:52.158
OUR ECONOMY WOULD BE FINE IF NOT

09:52.224 --> 09:53.359
FOR BIDEN'S STIMULUS COMPLETELY

09:53.426 --> 09:54.026
IGNORES WHAT IT WOULD'VE LOOKED

09:54.093 --> 09:56.128
LIKE WITHOUT IT.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.563
BECAUSE IT NOT ONLY PROTECTED

09:57.630 --> 09:59.165
LOW INCOME WORKERS, WHO WERE IN

09:59.231 --> 10:04.537
REAL TROUBLE, IT ALSO

10:04.603 --> 10:05.438
HELPED US AVOIDED A

10:05.504 --> 10:06.872
COVID-INDUCED FINANCIAL CRISIS.

10:06.939 --> 10:07.840
AND WHILE, WITH HINDSIGHT, MOST

10:07.907 --> 10:08.774
ECONOMISTS WOULD SAY THAT WE

10:08.841 --> 10:10.810
COULD HAVE MADE IT MORE TARGETED

10:10.876 --> 10:12.011
AND PRECISE SO THAT WE DIDN'T

10:12.078 --> 10:12.845
INCREASE THE MONEY SUPPLY ANY

10:12.912 --> 10:15.648
MORE THAN WE ABSOLUTELY HAD TO,

10:15.715 --> 10:16.682
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE

10:16.749 --> 10:17.583
THAT, ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE,

10:17.650 --> 10:18.417
WITHOUT THE AMERICAN RESCUE

10:18.484 --> 10:19.352
PLAN, THE ECONOMY WOULD HAVE

10:19.418 --> 10:20.853
COME CLOSE TO SUFFERING A

10:20.920 --> 10:21.921
DOUBLE-DIGIT RECESSION IN THE

10:21.988 --> 10:24.123
SPRING OF 2021.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.058
SO TWO THINGS ARE LIKELY TRUE

10:26.125 --> 10:28.394
HERE: THE GOVERNMENT STIMULUS

10:28.461 --> 10:30.296
DID CONTRIBUTE TO INFLATION, BUT

10:30.363 --> 10:31.831
IT WAS ALSO A NECESSARY

10:31.897 --> 10:33.466
INTERVENTION.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.801
AND THE MUCH BIGGER POINT IS,

10:35.868 --> 10:37.403
INFLATION CLEARLY ISN'T JUST

10:37.470 --> 10:39.305
ABOUT THE STIMULUS AT ALL.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.439
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT JUST A

10:40.506 --> 10:41.841
PROBLEM HERE IN THE U.S.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.809
BRITAIN AND GERMANY HAVE SEEN

10:43.876 --> 10:45.444
INFLATION RATES HIT FOUR-DECADE

10:45.511 --> 10:47.213
HIGHS, AND IN SEVEN EASTERN

10:47.279 --> 10:48.147
EUROPEAN NATIONS, IT'S NOW

10:48.214 --> 10:48.814
EXPECTED TO SURGE PAST DOUBLE

10:48.881 --> 10:50.516
DIGITS.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.684
AND IN JAPAN, IT'S HAD

10:51.751 --> 10:52.551
PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC

10:52.618 --> 10:55.021
CONSEQUENCES.

10:55.087 --> 10:55.888
>> WE'RE AT AN AQUARIUM IN

10:55.955 --> 10:57.390
HAKONE.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.357
THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION CAN BE

10:58.424 --> 11:00.659
FELT HERE, TOO.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.361
>> WITH THE RISING PRICE OF

11:02.428 --> 11:03.195
FEED, THEY'VE CHOSEN TO USE THE

11:03.262 --> 11:05.731
CHEAPER MACKEREL.

11:05.798 --> 11:06.699
>> HOW ARE THE PENGUINS REACTING

11:06.766 --> 11:10.736
TO THE NEW FEED?

11:10.803 --> 11:19.345
[LAUGHTER]

11:19.412 --> 11:26.352
>> SHE TRIES TO COAX IT TO EAT.

11:26.419 --> 11:27.720
>> THE PENGUIN DOESN'T LIKE IT.

11:27.787 --> 11:31.824
>> John: NO, IT DOES NOT.

11:31.891 --> 11:34.660
AND I DO NOT BLAME IT.

11:34.727 --> 11:35.227
I LOVE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING

11:35.294 --> 11:35.795
ABOUT THAT.

11:35.861 --> 11:36.395
MY NEW FAVORITE GENRE OF NEWS

11:36.462 --> 11:37.196
SEGMENT IS NOW "FOOTAGE OF WHAT

11:37.263 --> 11:37.897
APPEARS TO BE A LARGE,

11:37.963 --> 11:38.697
FLIGHTLESS BIRD BEING A MASSIVE

11:38.764 --> 11:39.565
BITCH."

11:39.632 --> 11:40.666
WHICH, NOW THAT I SAY IT OUT

11:40.733 --> 11:41.300
LOUD, WOULD BE A PRETTY ACCURATE

11:41.367 --> 11:43.636
TITLE FOR THIS SHOW.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.970
[LAUGHTER]

11:45.037 --> 11:45.871
BUT ALSO, REMEMBER: DEMAND IS

11:45.938 --> 11:48.007
ONLY ONE SIDE OF THIS EQUATION.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.075
THE OTHER SIDE IS SUPPLY.

11:49.141 --> 11:51.110
AND TO QUOTE MY THERAPIST,

11:51.177 --> 11:52.311
"LET'S COME BACK TO THAT FROG

11:52.378 --> 11:54.713
SPREADING ITS LEGS STATUE."

11:54.780 --> 11:55.748
[LAUGHTER]

11:55.815 --> 11:56.982
BECAUSE IN THAT SCENARIO WHERE

11:57.049 --> 11:58.150
EVERYONE WON THE LOTTERY, IF

11:58.217 --> 11:59.085
THERE HAPPENED TO BE ENOUGH FROG

11:59.151 --> 12:00.519
STATUES FOR EVERYONE TO BUY,

12:00.586 --> 12:01.387
THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY

12:01.454 --> 12:01.954
IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND

12:02.021 --> 12:03.656
DEMAND.

12:03.722 --> 12:09.128
AND PRICES WOULD BE STABLE.

12:09.195 --> 12:11.464
BUT REMEMBER, THERE ARE ONLY

12:11.530 --> 12:12.031
THREE GIANT STATUES LEFT IN

12:12.098 --> 12:12.898
STOCK.

12:12.965 --> 12:13.732
AND IF FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY

12:13.799 --> 12:14.700
CAN'T MAKE ANY MORE, THE PRICE

12:14.767 --> 12:15.668
OF THE REMAINING STATUES WILL

12:15.734 --> 12:16.635
THEN GO UP.

12:16.702 --> 12:17.403
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE AREN'T

12:17.470 --> 12:18.003
ACTUALLY THREE OF THEM LEFT

12:18.070 --> 12:18.838
ANYMORE.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.439
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE, AND IT'S

12:20.506 --> 12:23.109
RIGHT OVER HERE!

12:23.175 --> 12:23.976
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

12:24.043 --> 12:30.316
LOOK AT IT!

12:30.382 --> 12:30.850
LOOK AT MY BEAUTIFUL FROG

12:30.916 --> 12:31.684
STATUE!

12:31.750 --> 12:32.351
AND CRUCIALLY, WHAT THAT MEANS

12:32.418 --> 12:33.018
IS, THERE ARE NOW ONLY TWO OF

12:33.085 --> 12:34.353
THE FROG STATUES LEFT.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.087
EXCEPT, TO BE HONEST, THERE

12:35.154 --> 12:35.855
AREN'T TWO, BECAUSE I HAVE

12:35.921 --> 12:36.689
ANOTHER ONE AS WELL, AND IT'S

12:36.755 --> 12:39.058
RIGHT OVER THERE!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.426
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

12:40.493 --> 12:45.998
LOOK AT MY SECOND FROG STATUE!

12:46.065 --> 12:47.466
WHAT AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT PAIR!

12:47.533 --> 12:48.100
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THE

12:48.167 --> 12:48.701
LAST REMAINING FROG STATUE IS

12:48.767 --> 12:49.768
GONNA BE WORTH AN ABSOLUTE

12:49.835 --> 12:50.669
FORTUNE, WHICH TO BE HONEST, IS

12:50.736 --> 12:54.240
VERY GOOD NEWS FOR ME, BECAUSE I

12:54.306 --> 12:55.608
DID GET THAT ONE AS WELL.

12:55.674 --> 12:59.078
HERE IT IS!

12:59.145 --> 12:59.778
[APPLAUSE]

12:59.845 --> 13:00.880
I'M RICH!

13:00.946 --> 13:01.547
I'VE GOT ALL THE FROGS!

13:01.614 --> 13:02.248
I'VE CORNERED THE FROG STATUE

13:02.314 --> 13:03.282
MARKET!

13:03.349 --> 13:07.987
I'M GOOD AT BUSINESS!

13:08.053 --> 13:08.988
BUT LOOK, THE LARGER

13:09.054 --> 13:09.822
MACROECONOMIC POINT

13:09.889 --> 13:10.723
I'M MAKING IS, DEMAND IS

13:10.789 --> 13:11.557
CERTAINLY A FACTOR, BUT A

13:11.624 --> 13:12.124
SMALLER SUPPLY ALSO LEADS TO

13:12.191 --> 13:13.726
INFLATION.

13:13.792 --> 13:14.994
AND GENERALLY SPEAKING, WE'VE

13:15.060 --> 13:16.295
HAD DIMINISHED AND DISRUPTED

13:16.362 --> 13:17.763
SUPPLIES OF A LOT OF CONSUMER

13:17.830 --> 13:19.265
GOODS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE, THANKS

13:19.331 --> 13:21.033
TO COVID, FACTORIES OVERSEAS

13:21.100 --> 13:21.634
HAVE BEEN SHUT OR HAVE SLOWED

13:21.700 --> 13:23.202
DOWN CONSIDERABLY.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.970
TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, BICYCLES.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.772
THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE BIKE

13:26.839 --> 13:27.907
SHORTAGE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

13:27.973 --> 13:29.175
YEARS THANKS IN LARGE PART TO

13:29.241 --> 13:30.809
LOCKDOWNS AND SLOWDOWNS

13:30.876 --> 13:33.345
DISRUPTING BIKE PRODUCTION IN

13:33.412 --> 13:37.917
CHINA, WHERE ROUGHLY 90% OF ALL

13:37.983 --> 13:38.684
BIKES SOLD IN THE U.S. ARE

13:38.751 --> 13:39.685
PRODUCED.

13:39.752 --> 13:40.953
MEANWHILE, DEMAND FOR BIKES

13:41.020 --> 13:41.620
SOARED AS SHOPPERS TRIED TO STAY

13:41.687 --> 13:42.655
ACTIVE DURING LOCKDOWNS.

13:42.721 --> 13:43.889
MEANING THAT JUST A FEW MONTHS

13:43.956 --> 13:47.459
INTO THE PANDEMIC, WE WERE

13:47.526 --> 13:48.194
ALREADY SEEING STORIES LIKE

13:48.260 --> 13:49.161
THIS.

13:49.228 --> 13:50.296
>> BIKE SHOPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

13:50.362 --> 13:51.063
NOW SEEING SKYROCKETING DEMAND

13:51.130 --> 13:54.099
AND SUPPLIES DWINDLING.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.301
IN ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.101
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY THE ONLY ONE

13:56.168 --> 13:57.336
WE HAVE RIGHT AT THE MOMENT.

13:57.403 --> 13:58.470
>> AND IN NEW YORK CITY.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.438
>> HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A BIKE

13:59.505 --> 14:00.372
SHORTAGE LIKE THIS BEFORE?

14:00.439 --> 14:04.543
>> NO, NEVER.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.946
>> I'M SELLING WAY MORE PINK AND

14:07.012 --> 14:10.683
PURPLE TO GUYS BECAUSE THEY ARE

14:10.749 --> 14:12.618
JUST LIKE, WHATEVER, DOESN'T

14:12.685 --> 14:13.619
MATTER WHAT COLOR IT IS.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.922
IT IS WHAT IT IS, IT'S A BIKE.

14:16.989 --> 14:17.756
>> John: YEAH, THE BIKE SHORTAGE

14:17.823 --> 14:18.324
EVEN BROKE DOWN GENDER

14:18.390 --> 14:20.626
STEREOTYPES!

14:20.693 --> 14:21.560
[APPLAUSE]

14:21.627 --> 14:22.528
BUT INTERESTINGLY, WHILE PINK

14:22.595 --> 14:23.362
AND PURPLE BIKES ATTRACTED A NEW

14:23.429 --> 14:24.496
MALE DEMOGRAPHIC, PENNY FARTHING

14:24.563 --> 14:25.364
BIKES MAINTAINED THEIR

14:25.431 --> 14:26.165
TRADITIONAL CUSTOMER BASE: FANCY

14:26.232 --> 14:28.434
MUSTACHIOED PERVERTS.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.368
[LAUGHTER]

14:29.435 --> 14:33.973
ALL OF WHICH HELPS EXPLAIN WHY,

14:34.039 --> 14:34.840
LAST YEAR, THE AVERAGE

14:34.907 --> 14:43.015
RETAIL PRICE OF BIKE PRODUCTS

14:43.082 --> 14:43.749
WAS UP 43% COMPARED TO 2019.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.550
WHICH MEANS ESSENTIALLY ONE

14:44.617 --> 14:45.618
THING: IF YOU'RE THE SORT OF

14:45.684 --> 14:46.452
PERSON WHO STAYED ACTIVE AND

14:46.518 --> 14:47.419
EXERCISED DURING LOCKDOWN,

14:47.486 --> 14:48.621
INFLATION IS YOUR FAULT, AND

14:48.687 --> 14:50.923
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

14:50.990 --> 14:51.991
[LAUGHTER]

14:52.057 --> 14:53.058
THE POINT IS, INFLATION TRULY

14:53.125 --> 14:53.759
WAS A PERFECT STORM GOING INTO

14:53.826 --> 14:54.760
THE YEAR, AND IT SEEMS LIKE

14:54.827 --> 14:55.527
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE

14:55.594 --> 14:56.762
HAS ONLY MADE IT WORSE.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.364
WHEN BIDEN SAID "INFLATION IS

14:58.430 --> 15:00.266
LARGELY THE FAULT OF PUTIN,"

15:00.332 --> 15:01.433
THAT IS CLEARLY NOT TRUE.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.668
INFLATION WAS HAPPENING BEFORE

15:02.735 --> 15:04.737
PUTIN EVEN INVADED UKRAINE, SO

15:04.803 --> 15:07.239
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW TIME WORKS.

15:07.306 --> 15:08.707
WHAT IS TRUE, THOUGH, IS THAT

15:08.774 --> 15:09.341
PUTIN DEFINITELY EXACERBATED THE

15:09.408 --> 15:11.377
PROBLEM.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.012
THE INVASION OF UKRAINE GREATLY

15:13.078 --> 15:14.580
IMPACTED FOOD AND FUEL PRICES,

15:14.647 --> 15:16.749
AS THE WORLD CUT OFF ITS OIL

15:16.815 --> 15:17.816
PURCHASES FROM RUSSIA, DRIVING

15:17.883 --> 15:19.451
GAS PRICES -- WHICH WERE ALREADY

15:19.518 --> 15:21.220
RISING -- UP TO OUTRAGEOUS

15:21.287 --> 15:21.920
LEVELS, PERHAPS BEST SUMMED UP

15:21.987 --> 15:26.525
BY THIS GUY:

15:26.592 --> 15:27.660
>> BRUH, I JUST GOT A BRAND-NEW

15:27.726 --> 15:28.527
-- I JUST GOT A NEW CAR.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.428
MY FIRST CAR.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.230
NOW I SEE WHAT YOU MOTHERFUCKERS

15:31.297 --> 15:31.864
ARE TALKING ABOUT WITH THESE GAS

15:31.930 --> 15:33.599
PRICES.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.600
[LAUGHTER]

15:34.667 --> 15:36.368
MY SHIT WAS ON EMPTY.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.469
I PUT 20 BUCKS IN THE FUCKING --

15:37.536 --> 15:38.370
IN THE FUCKING TANK.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.307
LOOK AT THIS SHIT!

15:41.373 --> 15:42.374
[LAUGHTER]

15:42.441 --> 15:43.809
WHAT THE FUCK?

15:43.876 --> 15:44.910
THIS IS WHAT 20 FUCKING DOLLARS

15:44.977 --> 15:46.145
GETS ME?

15:46.211 --> 15:51.317
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

15:51.383 --> 15:51.583
[LAUGHTER]

15:51.650 --> 15:53.018
[APPLAUSE]

15:53.085 --> 15:54.320
>> John: YEAH, IF I HAD TO BET,

15:54.386 --> 15:55.321
I'D SAY 80% OF A GAS STATION

15:55.387 --> 15:56.088
EMPLOYEE'S JOB RIGHT NOW IS TO

15:56.155 --> 15:57.156
TALK PEOPLE DOWN FROM EXACTLY

15:57.222 --> 15:58.090
THIS SITUATION.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.325
THE OTHER 20% IS, AS ALWAYS,

15:59.391 --> 16:00.292
TRACKING DOWN SOME OF THE

16:00.359 --> 16:00.959
BLUE-EST DRINKS YOU'VE EVER

16:01.026 --> 16:02.895
SEEN.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.363
IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO SELL THOSE

16:04.430 --> 16:05.064
IN THE SAME STORE WHERE YOU SELL

16:05.130 --> 16:06.332
ANTIFREEZE?

16:06.398 --> 16:08.867
NOT FOR ME TO SAY.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.202
[LAUGHTER]

16:10.269 --> 16:11.403
SO PUTIN INVADING UKRAINE DIDN'T

16:11.470 --> 16:12.137
START THIS INFLATIONARY CYCLE,

16:12.204 --> 16:13.806
BUT IT IS MAKING IT WORSE.

16:13.872 --> 16:14.840
AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF

16:14.907 --> 16:18.010
CORPORATE GREED.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.178
IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT SOME

16:19.244 --> 16:20.312
COMPANIES ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

16:20.379 --> 16:22.514
OF THIS ENVIRONMENT TO DRIVE UP

16:22.581 --> 16:23.282
PRICES, AND GETTING RECORD

16:23.349 --> 16:25.918
PROFITS IN RETURN.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.453
AND THAT IS INFURIATING.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.821
BUT MOST ECONOMISTS WILL TELL

16:28.887 --> 16:31.523
YOU THAT'S NOT WHAT CAUSED

16:31.590 --> 16:32.124
INFLATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16:32.191 --> 16:33.025
AFTER ALL, IT'S NOT LIKE

16:33.092 --> 16:34.426
CORPORATIONS ONLY JUST GOT

16:34.493 --> 16:37.329
GREEDY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

16:37.396 --> 16:38.364
[LAUGHTER]

16:38.430 --> 16:39.965
COMPANIES WILL SHAMELESSLY

16:40.032 --> 16:40.866
PROFITEER THE SAME WAY THAT A

16:40.933 --> 16:43.502
DOG WILL MAKE AN ABSOLUTE MEAL

16:43.569 --> 16:45.003
OUT OF ITS OWN BALL SACK: IF

16:45.070 --> 16:46.905
LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES, THAT'S

16:46.972 --> 16:47.773
UNFORTUNATELY JUST WHAT IT'S

16:47.840 --> 16:49.108
GOING TO DO.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.810
SO, TO RECAP: RISING PRICES ARE

16:51.877 --> 16:53.145
DUE TO A TON OF FACTORS: A

16:53.212 --> 16:53.979
PANDEMIC, A STIMULUS, CHANGED

16:54.046 --> 16:55.581
SPENDING PATTERNS, SUPPLY CHAIN

16:55.647 --> 16:56.682
ISSUES, THE WAR IN UKRAINE, TO

16:56.749 --> 16:58.517
NAME JUST A FEW.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.185
AND ANYONE LOUDLY SAYING THAT

17:00.252 --> 17:01.987
ONE THING IS THE CAUSE OF

17:02.054 --> 17:06.191
INFLATION IS EITHER LYING OR HAS

17:06.258 --> 17:08.460
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE

17:08.527 --> 17:09.628
TALKING ABOUT.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.796
AND THE FACT IS, WHICHEVER

17:10.863 --> 17:11.630
COMBINATION OF THINGS GOT US

17:11.697 --> 17:12.431
INTO THIS MESS, THE ENTITY MANY

17:12.498 --> 17:14.700
ARE LOOKING TO TO GET US OUT OF

17:14.767 --> 17:16.268
IT IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.803
ONE OF ITS KEY DUTIES IS TO KEEP

17:17.870 --> 17:18.871
AN EYE OUT FOR THINGS THAT CAN

17:18.937 --> 17:19.938
DESTABILIZE THE ECONOMY, LIKE

17:20.005 --> 17:21.540
INFLATION, AND CONTROL IT BY

17:21.607 --> 17:22.274
RAISING AND LOWERING INTEREST

17:22.341 --> 17:24.910
RATES.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.178
VERY BASICALLY, THE FED CAN

17:26.245 --> 17:28.280
INCREASE HOW MUCH IT COSTS FOR

17:28.347 --> 17:29.815
BANKS TO BORROW MONEY, A COST

17:29.882 --> 17:30.849
THEY THEN PASS ALONG TO

17:30.916 --> 17:32.418
BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS,

17:32.484 --> 17:33.519
THROUGH HIGHER RATES ON THINGS

17:33.585 --> 17:35.354
LIKE MORTGAGES AND CREDIT CARDS.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.455
AND THE HIGHER THE INTEREST

17:36.522 --> 17:37.689
RATES, THE LESS INCLINED PEOPLE

17:37.756 --> 17:39.124
AND BUSINESSES WILL BE TO

17:39.191 --> 17:39.892
BORROW, AND THE MORE INCLINED

17:39.958 --> 17:41.794
THEY'LL BE TO SAVE.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.061
ESSENTIALLY, THE FED CAN

17:43.128 --> 17:44.229
INDIRECTLY INFLUENCE HOW MUCH

17:44.296 --> 17:47.266
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.667
SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEMAND

17:48.734 --> 17:49.701
SIDE OF THE ECONOMY, THEY HAVE

17:49.768 --> 17:51.336
SOME REAL POWER HERE.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.238
AND THE FACT IS, IN THIS CURRENT

17:53.305 --> 17:54.740
CRISIS, IT DID ARGUABLY TAKE TOO

17:54.807 --> 17:55.574
LONG FOR THE FED TO RAISE

17:55.641 --> 17:58.277
INTEREST RATES.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.144
THAT'S SOMETHING ITS CHAIRMAN,

17:59.211 --> 18:00.245
JEROME POWELL, BASICALLY

18:00.312 --> 18:01.213
ADMITTED AT A CONGRESSIONAL

18:01.280 --> 18:02.448
HEARING IN MARCH.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.349
JUST LISTEN TO HIM EXPLAIN THAT

18:04.416 --> 18:05.784
THE FED INITIALLY SAW EARLY

18:05.851 --> 18:07.519
SIGNS OF INFLATION AS BEING DUE

18:07.586 --> 18:10.556
TO A TEMPORARY SUPPLY SHOCK THAT

18:10.622 --> 18:11.990
WOULD SIMPLY RESOLVE ITSELF.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.625
>> WHAT THE TEXTBOOK SAYS IS THE

18:13.692 --> 18:14.259
SHOCK'S GOING TO COME AND IT'S

18:14.326 --> 18:15.227
GOING TO GO, AND YOU SHOULDN'T

18:15.294 --> 18:16.295
REACT TO IT.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.330
HINDSIGHT SAYS WE SHOULD HAVE

18:18.397 --> 18:19.298
MOVED EARLIER AND THAT TURNED

18:19.364 --> 18:20.499
OUT TO BE WRONG.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.633
NOT MAYBE CONCEPTUALLY WRONG,

18:21.700 --> 18:23.335
BUT IT'S JUST TAKING SO MUCH

18:23.402 --> 18:24.570
LONGER FOR THE SUPPLY SIDE TO

18:24.636 --> 18:25.604
HEAL THAN WE THOUGHT.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.339
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.607
THE STANDARD TEXTBOOK OF

18:28.674 --> 18:31.109
ECONOMICS SAYS THAT IF THERE'S A

18:31.176 --> 18:32.044
SUPPLY SHOCK, YOU LET IT RESOLVE

18:32.110 --> 18:33.078
ITSELF ORGANICALLY.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.646
UNFORTUNATELY -- AND IN FAIRNESS

18:34.713 --> 18:36.815
TO THE FED -- THE PANDEMIC WAS

18:36.882 --> 18:41.019
TOTALLY UNPRECEDENTED, SO THE

18:41.086 --> 18:41.620
STANDARD TEXTBOOK JUST DIDN'T

18:41.687 --> 18:42.421
APPLY.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.655
IN FACT, THE ONLY TEXTBOOK

18:43.722 --> 18:44.890
APPLICABLE TO THIS SITUATION

18:44.957 --> 18:45.691
WAS, "OH FUCK FUCK FUCK

18:45.757 --> 18:46.658
THE WHOLE WORLD SHUT DOWN

18:46.725 --> 18:47.893
WHAT DO WE DO OH GOD OH FUCK

18:47.960 --> 18:50.062
FUCK FUCK!"

18:50.128 --> 18:50.762
[LAUGHTER]

18:50.829 --> 18:52.531
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THE FED WAS

18:52.598 --> 18:53.799
ALONE IN CALLING IT WRONG.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.366
MOST ECONOMISTS THOUGHT

18:54.433 --> 18:55.434
INFLATION WOULD GO AWAY ON ITS

18:55.501 --> 18:56.668
OWN.

18:56.735 --> 18:57.803
AND SOME OF THE LOUDEST VOICES

18:57.870 --> 18:59.037
ON WALL STREET WERE ARGUING

18:59.104 --> 19:00.072
AGAINST THE FED RAISING INTEREST

19:00.138 --> 19:01.340
RATES, BECAUSE THEY, TOO,

19:01.406 --> 19:01.907
THOUGHT INFLATION WOULD BE

19:01.974 --> 19:04.977
TRANSITORY.

19:05.043 --> 19:05.811
FOR INSTANCE, HERE IS

19:05.878 --> 19:07.145
JIM CRAMER -- THE ANSWER TO THE

19:07.212 --> 19:07.913
QUESTION, "WHAT IF A GARBAGE CAN

19:07.980 --> 19:08.947
FULL OF COCAINE AND BUSINESS

19:09.014 --> 19:10.015
SCHOOL PAMPHLETS WISHED TO BE A

19:10.082 --> 19:11.650
REAL BOY?" -- MAKING THAT VERY

19:11.717 --> 19:12.417
ARGUMENT IN NOVEMBER OF LAST

19:12.484 --> 19:14.019
YEAR.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.654
>> THE BOTTOM LINE, I DON'T

19:15.721 --> 19:16.421
THINK POWELL NEEDS TO SLAM THE

19:16.488 --> 19:17.656
BRAKES ON THE ECONOMY.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.857
DESPITE WHAT YOU HEAR FROM THE

19:18.924 --> 19:20.993
"INFLATIONISTAS" IN THE MEDIA,

19:21.059 --> 19:23.662
THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE IS

19:23.729 --> 19:26.698
FINALLY GOING POWELL'S WAY, TEAM

19:26.765 --> 19:28.400
TRANSITORY IS GOING TO WIN!

19:28.467 --> 19:29.768
I SAY STOP FREAKING ABOUT

19:29.835 --> 19:30.769
INFLATION!

19:30.836 --> 19:31.970
>> John: OKAY.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.205
SETTING ASIDE THE FACT THAT HE'S

19:33.272 --> 19:33.872
SPEAKING WITH AN INTENSITY LEVEL

19:33.939 --> 19:35.007
BEST DESCRIBED AS "PATTI LUPONE

19:35.073 --> 19:36.408
ADMONISHING A RUDE AUDIENCE

19:36.475 --> 19:38.076
MEMBER," IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT

19:38.143 --> 19:40.579
THIS CLIP, MUCH LIKE JIM CRAMER

19:40.646 --> 19:42.281
HIMSELF, HAS NOT AGED VERY WELL.

19:42.347 --> 19:47.953
BECAUSE HERE HE WAS JUST SIX

19:48.020 --> 19:49.054
MONTHS LATER DOING A FULL 180

19:49.121 --> 19:49.888
WITH A VERY DIFFERENT TONE.

19:49.955 --> 19:50.822
>> I THINK THAT POWELL MAY NOT

19:50.889 --> 19:51.690
UNDERSTAND.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.091
WE GOT TO BREAK THIS, WE'VE GOT

19:53.158 --> 19:53.926
TO BREAK IT NOW, BECAUSE THIS

19:53.992 --> 19:57.129
WAS THE WEEK WE REALIZED THAT IT

19:57.195 --> 19:57.763
IS JUST INFLAMED, AND IT IS NOT

19:57.829 --> 19:59.498
GOING AWAY.

19:59.565 --> 20:02.067
AND I WAS -- I WAS JUST KIND

20:02.134 --> 20:03.402
OF -- JUST, I -- I -- LOOK, I

20:03.468 --> 20:05.437
WAS SHOCKED.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.338
[LAUGHTER]

20:06.405 --> 20:07.539
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS

20:07.606 --> 20:08.740
AS BAD AS IT IS.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.475
IT'S IN EVERY AISLE.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.810
THE INFLATION'S IN EVERY AISLE.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.444
>> John: WOW, THAT WAS A PRETTY

20:12.511 --> 20:13.912
DRAMATIC TURNAROUND.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.213
HE WENT FROM LOUDLY UNCONCERNED

20:15.280 --> 20:16.548
ABOUT RISING PRICES TO

20:16.615 --> 20:17.182
FULL-BLOWN "INFLATIONISTA" IN A

20:17.249 --> 20:18.383
MATTER OF MONTHS.

20:18.450 --> 20:19.651
AND QUICK QUESTION: WHAT EXACTLY

20:19.718 --> 20:20.619
IS GOING ON WITH THIS EXPRESSION

20:20.686 --> 20:23.021
RIGHT HERE?

20:23.088 --> 20:27.292
[LAUGHTER]

20:27.359 --> 20:28.093
THAT IS NOT THE FACE YOU MAKE

20:28.160 --> 20:28.660
WHEN YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

20:28.727 --> 20:29.661
INFLATION.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.562
THAT'S THE FACE YOU MAKE WHEN

20:30.629 --> 20:31.463
YOU'RE WATCHING A GIRAFFE GIVE

20:31.530 --> 20:32.764
BIRTH.

20:32.831 --> 20:33.632
THE FACT IS, A LOT OF SMART

20:33.699 --> 20:35.367
PEOPLE, AND JIM CRAMER, READ THE

20:35.434 --> 20:36.168
SITUATION WRONG.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.235
AND THERE ISN'T REALLY A ROAD

20:37.302 --> 20:41.773
MAP FOR WHAT TO DO NEXT.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.874
AS ONE "WALL STREET JOURNAL"

20:42.941 --> 20:43.942
COLUMNIST HAS SAID, "ECONOMIC

20:44.009 --> 20:45.077
MODELS THAT WORKED FOR DECADES

20:45.143 --> 20:45.744
BROKE DOWN DURING THE PANDEMIC,

20:45.811 --> 20:46.812
AND ALTERNATIVES HAVE YET TO

20:46.878 --> 20:47.746
EMERGE."

20:47.813 --> 20:49.147
NOW, ONE THING THAT WOULD REALLY

20:49.214 --> 20:49.915
HELP IS IF WE KNEW THE EXTENT TO

20:49.982 --> 20:50.916
WHICH THIS IS A SUPPLY OR A

20:50.983 --> 20:52.150
DEMAND PROBLEM.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.619
IF IT'S MORE ABOUT "TOO MUCH

20:53.685 --> 20:57.222
MONEY" OR "NOT ENOUGH STUFF."

20:57.289 --> 20:58.323
BECAUSE IF IT IS TOO MUCH MONEY,

20:58.390 --> 20:59.291
THE FED CAN IMPACT THAT PRETTY

20:59.358 --> 21:00.158
EASILY.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.426
WHAT THEY'D WANT TO DO IS RAISE

21:01.493 --> 21:02.561
INTEREST RATES SIGNIFICANTLY

21:02.628 --> 21:04.730
ENOUGH TO CURB SPENDING AND SLOW

21:04.796 --> 21:06.064
GROWTH, BUT NOT SO AGGRESSIVELY

21:06.131 --> 21:07.165
THAT IT WOULD THEN TRIGGER A

21:07.232 --> 21:09.067
PAINFUL RECESSION.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.136
BUT IF IT'S ABOUT "NOT ENOUGH

21:11.203 --> 21:12.604
STUFF" INSTEAD -- IF THE MAJOR

21:12.671 --> 21:13.939
ISSUES ARE THINGS LIKE SUPPLY

21:14.006 --> 21:15.507
CHAIN DISRUPTIONS -- THE EFFECT

21:15.574 --> 21:16.642
THE FED CAN HAVE IS DRASTICALLY

21:16.708 --> 21:17.709
REDUCED.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.378
BECAUSE THE FED CAN'T STOP THE

21:19.444 --> 21:21.246
WAR IN UKRAINE, OR OPEN

21:21.313 --> 21:22.014
FACTORIES IN CHINA THAT ARE

21:22.080 --> 21:23.382
CLOSED DUE TO COVID.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.350
I SUPPOSE JEROME POWELL COULD

21:25.417 --> 21:27.252
LEAD AN ARMY OF ECONOMISTS INTO

21:27.319 --> 21:29.454
LUHANSK, BUT I'M NOT SURE ANYONE

21:29.521 --> 21:30.422
WANTS TO SEE THAT, AND

21:30.489 --> 21:31.223
HISTORICALLY, THAT HASN'T BEEN

21:31.289 --> 21:34.459
THE FED'S ROLE.

21:34.526 --> 21:35.160
[LAUGHTER]

21:35.227 --> 21:36.461
SO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER

21:36.528 --> 21:37.429
INFLATION IS CAUSED MORE BY

21:37.496 --> 21:38.597
SUPPLY OR DEMAND BASICALLY

21:38.664 --> 21:39.998
DETERMINES HOW MUCH INFLUENCE

21:40.065 --> 21:41.867
THE FED HAS TO IMPROVE THINGS.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.402
UNFORTUNATELY, EVEN ECONOMISTS

21:43.468 --> 21:44.903
DON'T REALLY AGREE ON WHICH IS

21:44.970 --> 21:47.105
THE BIGGER DRIVER.

21:47.172 --> 21:48.640
MEANING THE TRUTH IS, INFLATION

21:48.707 --> 21:52.177
MAY NOT BE FULLY WITHIN OUR

21:52.244 --> 21:53.612
CONTROL RIGHT NOW.

21:53.679 --> 21:54.980
WHICH ISN'T TO SAY THAT

21:55.047 --> 21:56.081
BIDEN HASN'T BEEN OUT THERE

21:56.148 --> 21:57.082
PROMISING TO COMBAT IT AND

21:57.149 --> 21:58.050
SHOWING EMPATHY FOR AMERICANS

21:58.116 --> 21:58.950
WHO ARE STRUGGLING, SOMETIMES IN

21:59.017 --> 22:00.886
THE WEIRDEST WAY POSSIBLE.

22:00.952 --> 22:04.156
>> I WANT EVERY AMERICAN TO KNOW

22:04.222 --> 22:05.424
THAT I'M TAKING INFLATION VERY

22:05.490 --> 22:06.491
SERIOUSLY, AND IT'S MY TOP

22:06.558 --> 22:10.495
DOMESTIC PRIORITY.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.130
I KNOW YOU GOT TO BE FRUSTRATED.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.365
I KNOW.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.867
I CAN TASTE IT.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.335
[LAUGHTER]

22:17.402 --> 22:19.204
>> John: NO!

22:19.271 --> 22:21.306
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

22:21.373 --> 22:22.974
NEVER SAY THAT AGAIN!

22:23.041 --> 22:23.909
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE SINGLE

22:23.975 --> 22:24.710
GROSSEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD

22:24.776 --> 22:25.644
COME OUT OF JOE BIDEN'S MOUTH.

22:25.711 --> 22:31.683
AND THAT'S SAYING A LOT, BECAUSE

22:31.750 --> 22:34.720
I'VE HEARD THE STUFF HE USED TO

22:34.786 --> 22:36.121
SAY IN THE '70s.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.022
BUT TO BE FAIR, I GET WHY

22:37.089 --> 22:37.756
BIDEN'S TAKING THIS APPROACH.

22:37.823 --> 22:38.623
AMERICANS VIEW INFLATION AS THE

22:38.690 --> 22:39.658
TOP PROBLEM FACING THE U.S.

22:39.725 --> 22:40.792
AHEAD OF THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS,

22:40.859 --> 22:42.160
AHEAD OF EVERY OTHER CALAMITY

22:42.227 --> 22:43.028
FACING THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING

22:43.095 --> 22:45.464
EZRA MILLER.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.531
[LAUGHTER]

22:46.598 --> 22:47.365
AND THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FOR

22:47.432 --> 22:48.667
TRYING TO RAISE PUBLIC

22:48.734 --> 22:49.501
CONFIDENCE.

22:49.568 --> 22:50.602
ONCE AN INFLATIONARY CYCLE

22:50.669 --> 22:52.070
STARTS, SIMPLY THE EXPECTATION

22:52.137 --> 22:53.805
OF IT CAN KEEP INFLATION GOING.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.006
FOR INSTANCE, AS THE COST OF

22:55.073 --> 22:56.141
LIVING RISES, WORKERS MIGHT

22:56.208 --> 22:57.442
DEMAND HIGHER WAGES TO COVER

22:57.509 --> 23:00.178
THAT, WHICH IN TURN, RAISES THE

23:00.245 --> 23:01.613
COST OF LABOR, LEADING

23:01.680 --> 23:02.547
BUSINESSES TO CHARGE HIGHER

23:02.614 --> 23:03.148
PRICES, LEADING TO STILL MORE

23:03.215 --> 23:05.917
INFLATION.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.452
IT'S BASICALLY A VICIOUS CYCLE.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.054
THAT IS WHY THE WORSE OUR

23:09.121 --> 23:09.988
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE, THE

23:10.055 --> 23:11.189
WORSE IT CAN GET.

23:11.256 --> 23:13.325
AND THAT MAY HELP EXPLAIN WHY

23:13.391 --> 23:14.693
THE FED -- ALBEIT LATE -- IS NOW

23:14.760 --> 23:16.461
TAKING SOME BIG STEPS.

23:16.528 --> 23:17.963
IT RECENTLY ENACTED THE BIGGEST

23:18.029 --> 23:18.697
INCREASE TO INTEREST RATES SINCE

23:18.764 --> 23:20.665
1994.

23:20.732 --> 23:25.170
AND IT'S ALL BUT CERTAIN THAT

23:25.237 --> 23:25.771
IT WILL RAISE THEM AGAIN NEXT

23:25.837 --> 23:26.705
WEEK.

23:26.772 --> 23:27.672
MEANWHILE, JEROME POWELL HAS

23:27.739 --> 23:28.540
BEEN TRYING TO REASSURE PEOPLE

23:28.607 --> 23:29.674
THAT THE FED HAS THINGS UNDER

23:29.741 --> 23:30.542
CONTROL.

23:30.609 --> 23:31.676
ALTHOUGH HE'S ALSO NOTABLY GONE

23:31.743 --> 23:32.844
FROM TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO

23:32.911 --> 23:33.545
ENGINEER A "SOFT LANDING" FOR

23:33.612 --> 23:34.546
THE ECONOMY, TO SOMETHING

23:34.613 --> 23:36.481
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

23:36.548 --> 23:37.549
>> SO, I WOULD SAY THERE'S A --

23:37.616 --> 23:39.184
THERE'S A, YOU KNOW -- THERE ARE

23:39.251 --> 23:45.457
A NUMBER OF PLAUSIBLE PATHS TO

23:45.524 --> 23:46.825
HAVING A SOFT, OR AS I'VE SAID,

23:46.892 --> 23:47.759
SOFT-ISH LANDING.

23:47.826 --> 23:48.794
>> John: OH!

23:48.860 --> 23:50.262
SO WE'RE AIMING FOR A "SOFT-ISH"

23:50.328 --> 23:51.396
LANDING NOW, ARE WE?

23:51.463 --> 23:52.330
THE THING IS, "ISH" ISN'T

23:52.397 --> 23:53.198
EXACTLY THE MOST REASSURING

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
SUFFIX TO HEAR WHEN YOU'RE

23:54.332 --> 23:56.835
DISCUSSING SOMETHING SO SERIOUS.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.670
THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE

23:58.737 --> 23:59.871
BETWEEN A SURGEON TELLING YOU,

23:59.938 --> 24:01.273
"THE SURGERY WENT WELL" AND

24:01.339 --> 24:03.642
"IT WENT WELL...ISH."

24:03.708 --> 24:06.778
[LAUGHTER]

24:06.845 --> 24:07.546
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THINGS

24:07.612 --> 24:08.713
ARE GOING TO GO, EXACTLY.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.447
I'M NOT A MONETARY POLICY WONK,

24:09.514 --> 24:10.615
EVEN THOUGH MY CLOTHING,

24:10.682 --> 24:11.516
GLASSES, HAIRCUT, AND GENERAL

24:11.583 --> 24:12.584
VIBE WOULD STRONGLY BEG TO

24:12.651 --> 24:15.020
DIFFER.

24:15.086 --> 24:15.887
[LAUGHTER]

24:15.954 --> 24:17.322
ALTHOUGH FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

24:17.389 --> 24:17.956
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SMALL

24:18.023 --> 24:18.723
ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENTS

24:18.790 --> 24:19.791
RECENTLY.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.126
AMONG OTHER THINGS, GAS PRICES

24:21.193 --> 24:22.027
HAVE BEEN DROPPING, AND

24:22.093 --> 24:23.261
LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

24:23.328 --> 24:24.262
RECENTLY TICKED DOWN AFTER THE

24:24.329 --> 24:25.864
FED'S INTERVENTION.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.166
MOST ECONOMISTS NOW EXPECT THIS

24:28.233 --> 24:33.638
WAVE OF INFLATION TO PASS IN A

24:33.705 --> 24:36.641
YEAR OR 18 MONTHS, ALTHOUGH

24:36.708 --> 24:39.244
THAT'S BY NO MEANS CERTAIN, AND

24:39.311 --> 24:40.345
IMPORTANTLY: THAT'S AN

24:40.412 --> 24:41.079
INCREDIBLY LONG TIME FOR

24:41.146 --> 24:42.147
THOSE SUFFERING THE MOST.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.281
BECAUSE FOR ALL OUR DISCUSSION

24:43.348 --> 24:44.115
OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND CURVES,

24:44.182 --> 24:44.950
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

24:45.016 --> 24:45.650
INFLATION'S EFFECTS ARE ANYTHING

24:45.717 --> 24:46.585
BUT ABSTRACT FOR THOSE IT'S

24:46.651 --> 24:47.619
HITTING THE HARDEST, LIKE THIS

24:47.686 --> 24:48.486
WOMAN, DESCRIBING SHOPPING WITH

24:48.553 --> 24:50.989
HER KIDS.

24:51.056 --> 24:56.862
>> THEY SEE IT, YOU KNOW, LIKE

24:56.928 --> 24:57.562
WHEN I'M IN LINE AND I'M LIKE,

24:57.629 --> 25:00.198
YOU KNOW, CALCULATING IN MY HEAD

25:00.265 --> 25:00.765
AND LOOKING AT MY GROCERIES,

25:00.832 --> 25:01.266
RIGHT.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.400
LIKE, LITERALLY, I HAVE MY

25:02.467 --> 25:03.668
CALCULATOR OUT, LIKE, DOING THE

25:03.735 --> 25:05.270
TAX AND, LIKE, WHAT IS THIS

25:05.337 --> 25:06.137
GOING TO COME TO?

25:06.204 --> 25:06.938
OR I'M PUTTING THINGS BACK AS WE

25:07.005 --> 25:07.873
GET CLOSER IN LINE, YOU KNOW.

25:07.939 --> 25:08.940
AND MY OLDEST DAUGHTER IS, LIKE,

25:09.007 --> 25:10.141
LOOKING AT ME AND THEN, LIKE,

25:10.208 --> 25:14.613
SHE'S PUTTING SOMETHING BACK.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.714
IT JUST, YOU KNOW, BREAKS YOUR

25:15.780 --> 25:16.648
HEART A LITTLE BIT.

25:16.715 --> 25:17.515
>> John: YEAH.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.583
KIDS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY

25:18.650 --> 25:23.521
ABOUT PUTTING FOOD BACK ON THE

25:23.588 --> 25:24.489
SHELVES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD

25:24.556 --> 25:25.223
IT.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.157
KIDS SHOULD DO WHAT THEY'RE

25:26.224 --> 25:27.292
MEANT TO AT THE GROCERY STORE:

25:27.359 --> 25:28.126
GO OVER TO THE BIG BIN OF RUBBER

25:28.193 --> 25:29.427
BALLS THAT ARE INEXPLICABLY SOLD

25:29.494 --> 25:30.262
THERE AND CAUSE ABSOLUTE

25:30.328 --> 25:33.198
MAYHEM.

25:33.265 --> 25:33.765
[LAUGHTER]

25:33.832 --> 25:35.667
SO THE NEXT YEAR IS LIKELY TO BE

25:35.734 --> 25:36.401
VERY HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE,

25:36.468 --> 25:37.202
WHICH IS WHY WHAT WE SHOULD

25:37.269 --> 25:41.339
DEFINITELY BE DOING IS HELPING

25:41.406 --> 25:42.240
THEM.

25:42.307 --> 25:43.408
ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO HELP LOW

25:43.475 --> 25:44.075
INCOME FAMILIES WOULD BE TO PASS

25:44.142 --> 25:44.910
A REFUNDABLE CHILD TAX CREDIT

25:44.976 --> 25:48.647
FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.347
AND I KNOW THAT MAY BE HARD IN

25:49.414 --> 25:49.881
AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE

25:49.948 --> 25:51.116
GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS BEING

25:51.182 --> 25:51.716
BLAMED FOR FUELING INFLATION.

25:51.783 --> 25:52.450
BUT IT COULD BE NARROWLY

25:52.517 --> 25:53.852
TARGETED, WHILE ALSO FULLY

25:53.919 --> 25:54.686
OFFSET, WITH HIGHER TAXES ON

25:54.753 --> 25:55.487
HIGHER EARNERS.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.688
WE COULD ALSO EXPAND RENTAL

25:56.755 --> 25:57.555
ASSISTANCE, SOMETHING ECONOMISTS

25:57.622 --> 25:58.523
SAY WOULD HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT

25:58.590 --> 25:59.357
ON DRIVING INFLATION FURTHER UP,

25:59.424 --> 26:00.158
WHILE ALSO KEEPING PEOPLE IN

26:00.225 --> 26:04.663
THEIR HOMES.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.032
LOOK, THINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY

26:07.098 --> 26:08.033
PRETTY BAD RIGHT NOW.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.100
FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING,

26:09.167 --> 26:10.902
PENGUINS ARE PISSED, AND JIM

26:10.969 --> 26:14.472
CRAMER LOOKS LIKE HE JUST SHIT

26:14.539 --> 26:16.908
HIMSELF.

26:16.975 --> 26:17.575
[LAUGHTER]

26:17.642 --> 26:18.476
AND THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

26:18.543 --> 26:19.511
UNCERTAINTY HERE.

26:19.577 --> 26:20.545
BUT THERE ARE ALSO TWO THINGS WE

26:20.612 --> 26:21.680
KNOW FOR SURE: ONE, IT'S GOING

26:21.746 --> 26:22.314
TO TAKE A DIFFICULT COMBINATION

26:22.380 --> 26:23.181
OF MONETARY POLICY, SUPPLY CHAIN

26:23.248 --> 26:24.149
RECOVERY, AND TIME TO BRING

26:24.215 --> 26:24.883
SUPPLY AND DEMAND BACK INTO

26:24.950 --> 26:25.817
ALIGNMENT.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.085
AND TWO, THAT IF EVERYONE DOES

26:27.152 --> 26:28.687
WIN THE LOTTERY IN THE FUTURE,

26:28.753 --> 26:29.487
AND SUDDENLY WANTS FROG STATUES,

26:29.554 --> 26:32.190
I JUST MADE THE SMARTEST

26:32.257 --> 26:35.026
INVESTMENT OF ALL TIME!

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

26:36.194 --> 26:36.795
I'M THE WARREN BUFFETT OF FROGS!

26:56.047 --> 26:59.384

27:01.052 --> 27:02.454
IS IT?

27:06.958 --> 27:08.560
OF BREAD AND IT WAS TOAST.

27:47.665 --> 27:48.867
BEFORE WE GO, A QUICK UPDATE ON

27:48.933 --> 27:49.467
SOMETHING WE MENTIONED DURING

27:49.534 --> 27:50.168
THE BREAK.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.036
SPECIFICALLY, DOLLS.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.070
THE SINGLE WEIRDEST THING TO

27:52.137 --> 27:53.638
BRING TO A JOB INTERVIEW.

27:53.705 --> 27:54.572
"I WENT TO UNC, BUT LILIANA WENT

27:56.674 --> 28:00.045
[LAUGHTER]

28:00.111 --> 28:01.446
OVER THE JULY 4th WEEKEND WE

28:01.513 --> 28:02.280
RELEASED A WEB PIECE ABOUT THE

28:02.347 --> 28:03.081
FACT DOLLS HAVE BEEN WASHING UP

28:03.148 --> 28:03.982
ON A PARTICULAR STRETCH OF BEACH

28:04.049 --> 28:04.749
IN TEXAS.

28:04.816 --> 28:05.817
AND EACH ONE IS A LEGITIMATE

28:05.884 --> 28:07.886
HORROR SHOW -- FROM

28:07.952 --> 28:09.154
"GREEN PIRATE BABY," TO

28:09.220 --> 28:10.922
"NIGHTMARE GHOUL BABY," TO

28:10.989 --> 28:12.323
"BARNACLE BABY" ONE, TWO, AND

28:12.390 --> 28:13.992
THREE.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.160
HONESTLY, I NOW SEE THESE DEMONS

28:15.226 --> 28:16.227
EVERYWHERE.

28:16.294 --> 28:17.529
IN THE MIRROR?

28:17.595 --> 28:20.031
SUDDENLY THERE'S A DOLL.

28:20.098 --> 28:29.407
IN THE STUNNING, HUMBLING

28:29.474 --> 28:29.941
IMAGES FROM THE JAMES WEBB

28:30.008 --> 28:30.842
SPACE TELESCOPE?

28:30.909 --> 28:33.845
ANOTHER DOLL.

28:33.912 --> 28:34.913
LOOK, I'M 45-YEARS-OLD.

28:34.979 --> 28:35.547
I'VE ENCOUNTERED A WIDE BREADTH

28:35.613 --> 28:36.247
OF EMOTIONS.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.048
BUT NOT UNTIL I SAW THESE THINGS

28:37.115 --> 28:37.816
DID I EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF

28:37.882 --> 28:38.383
BEING HUNTED.

28:38.450 --> 28:39.584
AND I WILL SAY: IT SEEMS LIKE

28:39.651 --> 28:40.185
THE LOCAL NEWS IN TEXAS

28:40.251 --> 28:41.119
APPRECIATED US GIVING THEIR

28:41.186 --> 28:41.719
PLIGHT SOME ATTENTION.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.021
>> THIS IS A LITTLE CREEPY.

28:43.088 --> 28:43.655
IT'S HAPPENING ALONG THE BEACHES

28:43.721 --> 28:45.557
IN SOUTH TEXAS.

28:45.623 --> 28:47.559
AND WHILE, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING

28:47.625 --> 28:49.561
CAN WASH UP ON SHORE, THESE

28:49.627 --> 28:52.230
DOLLS ARE REALLY TURNING HEADS.

28:52.297 --> 28:53.631
RECENTLY, THE TREND CAUGHT

28:53.698 --> 28:55.200
THE EYE OF HBO'S JOHN OLIVER WHO

28:55.266 --> 28:57.168
OFFERED UP HIS OWN SOLUTION FOR

28:57.235 --> 28:59.804
WHAT HE CALLS "THE DEMON DOLLS."

28:59.871 --> 29:01.406
[LAUGHTER]

29:01.473 --> 29:03.241
>> BURN THEM!

29:03.308 --> 29:04.008
BURN THEM NOW!

29:04.075 --> 29:07.612
>> John: YEAH.

29:07.679 --> 29:08.646
I SAID THAT.

29:08.713 --> 29:09.514
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:09.581 --> 29:10.782
I STAND BY THAT SENTIMENT.

29:10.849 --> 29:11.583
ALTHOUGH OUR IDEA WASN'T JUST

29:11.649 --> 29:12.550
THAT THE DOLLS SHOULD BE BURNED.

29:12.617 --> 29:13.618
IT'S THAT THE COASTAL RESERVE

29:13.685 --> 29:14.219
THAT KEEPS FINDING THEM SHOULD

29:14.285 --> 29:15.320
SELL THEM TO US, AND ALLOW US TO

29:15.386 --> 29:16.154
FIND AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO

29:16.221 --> 29:20.558
DISPOSE OF THEM.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.061
SO WE OFFERED $10,000 TO THEIR

29:23.128 --> 29:25.363
TURTLE HOSPITAL IF THEY SENT AS

29:25.430 --> 29:26.631
EVERY REMAINING PLASTIC BEAST

29:26.698 --> 29:27.365
THEY HAD.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.133
AND APPARENTLY THEY GOT THE

29:28.199 --> 29:29.033
MESSAGE.

29:29.100 --> 29:29.968
>> HE SAID THAT THEY WERE GONNA

29:30.034 --> 29:31.369
DONATE, YOU KNOW, IF I SENT HIM

29:31.436 --> 29:32.237
ALL THE DOLLS THAT I HAVE, THEY

29:32.303 --> 29:32.837
WERE GONNA DONATE $10,000, AND

29:32.904 --> 29:33.872
THEN THEY WERE GONNA DESTROY ALL

29:33.938 --> 29:36.274
THE DOLLS.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.408
[LAUGHS]

29:37.475 --> 29:38.443
AND I THOUGHT, THAT SOUNDS

29:38.510 --> 29:39.811
REALLY GOOD TO ME, 'CAUSE, YOU

29:39.878 --> 29:40.845
KNOW, THE AMOS REHABILITATION

29:40.912 --> 29:42.280
KEEP THAT REHABS THE SEA

29:42.347 --> 29:43.748
TURTLES, THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH RUN

29:43.815 --> 29:45.650
ON DONATIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY,

29:45.717 --> 29:47.519
SO $10,000 CAN GO A LONG WAY AND

29:47.585 --> 29:48.219
SAVE HUNDREDS OF SEA TURTLES, SO

29:48.286 --> 29:55.093
I'M ALL ABOUT THAT.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.027
>> John: OH, YEAH, YEAH, ME TOO.

29:56.094 --> 29:56.995
I LIKE SEA TURTLES.

29:57.061 --> 29:58.096
I THINK THEY'RE FUN, ROUND

29:58.163 --> 29:59.497
LITTLE GUYS.

29:59.564 --> 30:04.769
BUT WAS THAT MY MAIN OBJECTIVE?

30:04.836 --> 30:05.904
NO, OF COURSE FUCKING NOT.

30:05.970 --> 30:06.938
THIS WAS MAINLY ABOUT SAVING THE

30:07.005 --> 30:07.972
PLANET FROM THE HEINOUS SCOURGE

30:08.039 --> 30:08.907
OF THESE PLASTIC BEACH DEMONS.

30:08.973 --> 30:09.707
ANYWAY, WE BEGAN A

30:09.774 --> 30:10.975
CORRESPONDENCE WITH THAT MAN,

30:11.042 --> 30:12.110
INCLUDING, AT ONE POINT, HIM

30:12.177 --> 30:12.744
SENDING US THIS PHOTO OF THE

30:12.810 --> 30:13.545
AVAILABLE DOLLS.

30:13.611 --> 30:14.812
WHICH IS REALLY BAD.

30:14.879 --> 30:17.482
A REALLY BAD WAY TO DO THINGS.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.051
A BUCKET IS THE SINGLE WORST

30:20.118 --> 30:21.786
PLACE TO KEEP THEM, OTHER THAN

30:21.853 --> 30:22.453
AT A HOSPITAL IN BASSINETS RIGHT

30:22.520 --> 30:24.822
NEXT TO REAL BABIES.

30:24.889 --> 30:27.959
[LAUGHTER]

30:28.026 --> 30:29.127
BUT WE KEPT UP OUR END OF THE

30:29.194 --> 30:31.329
DEAL.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.564
WE SENT THE TURTLE REHAB THE

30:32.630 --> 30:33.264
MONEY, AND IN RETURN, THEY SENT

30:33.331 --> 30:33.798
US THE DOLLS.

30:33.865 --> 30:34.966
NOW, WE WERE ACTUALLY ON BREAK

30:35.033 --> 30:35.733
WHEN THAT HAPPENED, SO ONE OF

30:35.800 --> 30:36.701
OUR STAFF MEMBERS HAD THEM

30:36.768 --> 30:40.038
SHIPPED DIRECTLY TO HER HOME,

30:40.104 --> 30:42.473
MEANING SHE HAD IN THE PLACE

30:42.540 --> 30:43.408
WHERE SHE LIVES THIS BOX.

30:43.474 --> 30:44.042
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:44.108 --> 30:45.243
I TAKE IT BACK.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.044
THE BUCKET WAS FINE.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.178
THIS BOX IS A MUCH WORSE PLACE

30:47.245 --> 30:47.879
TO KEEP THEM.

30:47.946 --> 30:48.980
BUT THE FACT IS: WE ARE NOW IN

30:49.047 --> 30:51.449
POSSESSION OF THIS LARGE BUCKET

30:51.516 --> 30:54.152
FULL OF MY WORST NIGHTMARES.

30:54.219 --> 30:55.653
[APPLAUSE]

30:55.720 --> 30:56.821
THIS MAY BE THE SINGLE CREEPIEST

30:56.888 --> 30:58.289
THING THAT'S EVER BEEN INSIDE OF

30:58.356 --> 30:59.457
THIS BUILDING, WHICH IS SAYING

30:59.524 --> 31:00.291
SOMETHING BECAUSE CHARLIE ROSE

31:00.358 --> 31:02.393
USED TO WORK DOWN THE HALL.

31:02.460 --> 31:03.628
[LAUGHTER]

31:03.695 --> 31:04.896
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO WHAT

31:04.963 --> 31:06.331
WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH THEM, WE

31:06.397 --> 31:07.365
ACTUALLY HAVE A SECOND QUICK

31:07.432 --> 31:09.334
UPDATE FOR YOU.

31:09.400 --> 31:10.568
BECAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER WE HAVE

31:10.635 --> 31:11.502
ANOTHER OUTSTANDING OFFER ON THE

31:11.569 --> 31:13.071
TABLE.

31:13.137 --> 31:14.672
BACK IN JUNE, WE DISCUSSED

31:14.739 --> 31:16.241
THIS GIANT AUSTRALIAN BANANA,

31:16.307 --> 31:17.775
WHICH WAS INSTALLED IN THE CITY

31:17.842 --> 31:19.477
OF YARRA, IN MELBOURNE, AS PART

31:19.544 --> 31:21.646
OF A CITY COUNCIL PROJECT TO

31:21.713 --> 31:22.513
SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.681
BUT IT WAS SADLY REMOVED AFTER

31:23.748 --> 31:24.616
SOMEONE VANDALIZED IT WITH A

31:24.682 --> 31:25.783
SAW.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.018
NOW, THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY

31:27.085 --> 31:32.323
OVER THE BANANA, ESPECIALLY

31:32.390 --> 31:35.226
BECAUSE YARRA APPARENTLY SPENT

31:35.293 --> 31:36.461
$22,000 ON IT.

31:36.527 --> 31:37.996
SO WE OFFERED TO BUY IT FOR $10,

31:38.062 --> 31:40.331
PLUS A $10,000 DONATION TO THEIR

31:40.398 --> 31:41.499
LOCAL FOOD BANK, AND A $5,000

31:41.566 --> 31:42.267
DONATION TO THE JOHN OLIVER

31:42.333 --> 31:44.769
KOALA CHLAMYDIA WARD.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.237
[LAUGHTER]

31:46.304 --> 31:48.740
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

31:48.806 --> 31:49.774
WE ALSO OFFERED OUR "GIANT

31:49.841 --> 31:50.341
ALLIGATOR GIVING THE FINGER"

31:50.408 --> 31:51.276
STATUE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR

31:51.342 --> 31:52.110
THEM.

31:52.176 --> 31:53.244
IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.

31:53.311 --> 31:54.145
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW WE ACTUALLY

31:54.212 --> 31:55.880
JUST HEARD BACK FROM YARRA.

31:55.947 --> 31:56.914
>> HI, JOHN, I'M SOPHIE WAY, THE

31:56.981 --> 31:57.815
MAYOR OF THE CITY OF YARRA, IN

31:57.882 --> 31:58.883
MELBOURNE.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.385
WE WERE THRILLED TO RECEIVE YOUR

32:00.451 --> 32:01.552
OFFER TO PROVIDE A HOME FOR OUR

32:01.619 --> 32:02.220
BELOVED YET BELEAGUERED BANANA

32:02.287 --> 32:03.321
STATUE.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.056
AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION

32:05.123 --> 32:05.757
HOWEVER, WE MUST DECLINE YOUR

32:05.823 --> 32:07.025
OFFER.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.693
PUBLIC ART IS AN INVESTMENT IN

32:08.760 --> 32:09.861
LOCAL ARTISTS, THE COMMUNITY,

32:09.927 --> 32:11.696
AND THE VIBRANCY OF OUR STREETS,

32:11.763 --> 32:12.930
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE PRIVATIZED

32:12.997 --> 32:15.133
AND KEPT IN AN OFFICE.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.834
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I WOULDN'T

32:16.901 --> 32:17.869
CALL THIS "PUBLIC ART" SO MUCH

32:17.935 --> 32:20.204
AS I'D CALL IT "THE FINAL BOSS

32:20.271 --> 32:21.172
IN DONKEY KONG," BUT AGREE TO

32:21.239 --> 32:22.974
DISAGREE THERE.

32:23.041 --> 32:23.741
[LAUGHTER]

32:23.808 --> 32:26.978
BUT SECOND, THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY

32:27.045 --> 32:28.046
DISAPPOINTING FOR ME TO HEAR.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.147
ALTHOUGH SHE DID HAVE A FOLLOWUP

32:29.213 --> 32:29.947
SUGGESTION.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.149
>> WE WOULD LOVE TO OFFER YOUR

32:31.215 --> 32:31.916
BELLIGERENT ALLIGATOR A NEW HOME

32:31.983 --> 32:32.884
HERE IN MELBOURNE.

32:32.950 --> 32:33.584
WE KNOW YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED

32:33.651 --> 32:34.419
ABOUT THE BANANA.

32:34.485 --> 32:35.853
WHO WOULDN'T BE?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.588
SO AS COMPENSATION, WE WILL NAME

32:37.655 --> 32:38.523
OUR POLYSTYRENE RECYCLING

32:38.589 --> 32:41.025
MACHINE AFTER YOU.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.060
[LAUGHTER]

32:42.126 --> 32:43.227
IT TURNS TRASH INTO TREASURE,

32:43.294 --> 32:44.562
MAKES A LOT OF NOISE, AND NERDS

32:44.629 --> 32:45.296
LOVE IT.

32:45.363 --> 32:46.264
SO IT SEEMS FITTING.
