00:00.535 --> 00:03.336
<i>- My name is Michael Westen.</i> 
<i>- I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.803 --> 00:07.338
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.406 --> 00:09.776
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.346
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.414 --> 00:14.816
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.884 --> 00:16.853
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.921 --> 00:20.092
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.160 --> 00:22.728
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.796 --> 00:24.330
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.397 --> 00:25.965
Should we shoot them?

00:26.033 --> 00:28.535
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.595 --> 00:30.929
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.217 --> 00:33.685
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.753 --> 00:35.854
<i>...if you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.922 --> 00:38.356
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.424 --> 00:40.025
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:45.131 --> 00:47.132
Max's murder
is officially closed.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.500
I'm supposed to tell you

00:48.568 --> 00:50.202
that your standing with
the agency won't be affected.

00:50.269 --> 00:52.771
And what exactly is
my standing with the Agency?

00:52.838 --> 00:55.006
You have fans
and you have detractors.

00:55.074 --> 00:56.942
Let me guess
which side <i>you're</i> on.

00:57.009 --> 00:58.410
You're gonna help me
break in

00:58.477 --> 00:59.678
to the British Consulate.

00:59.745 --> 01:02.047
I brought along
some help.

01:02.114 --> 01:04.081
Say hello to Anson.

01:05.851 --> 01:07.219
I never wanted to kill Michael.

01:07.286 --> 01:08.787
Touch him, you are dead.

01:10.656 --> 01:12.624
I told you not to test me.

01:12.692 --> 01:14.359
My wife has been taken.

01:14.427 --> 01:16.261
This lunatic strapped a bomb
to her neck.

01:16.329 --> 01:18.363
You said
he wouldn't kill her!

01:18.431 --> 01:20.398
Claire! Claire!

01:20.466 --> 01:21.933
We take out the guards
with rubber bullets,

01:22.001 --> 01:24.035
and we go after Larry
with the real ones!

01:24.103 --> 01:26.338
You are talking about
an armed assault

01:26.405 --> 01:28.139
of a friendly
government consulate, Fi!

01:28.207 --> 01:30.508
The three of us are gonna wind up
in prison for the rest of our lives!

01:30.576 --> 01:32.377
Ohh!

01:33.479 --> 01:35.347
This is bulletproof.

01:35.414 --> 01:37.816
Go get a .50 cal --
then maybe you got a shot.

01:45.491 --> 01:46.858
Oh, God.

01:46.926 --> 01:49.261
Fi, why did you plant the bomb
in the lobby?

01:49.328 --> 01:50.595
I didn't.

01:50.663 --> 01:53.531
I made one targeted explosive,
just enough for Larry.

01:53.599 --> 01:56.601
The security guards --
they're dead.

01:56.669 --> 01:59.337
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to hold all the cards today.

01:59.405 --> 02:01.273
Larry didn't kill his wife.

02:01.340 --> 02:02.474
You don't think
I'd actually...

02:02.541 --> 02:04.009
Blow up my <i>wife.</i>

02:04.076 --> 02:06.144
I have you blowing up that
building six ways from Sunday.

02:06.212 --> 02:07.812
I like to call it leverage.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.913
I hold your girlfriend's fate
in my hands.

02:09.982 --> 02:11.716
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the last one of them.

02:14.754 --> 02:16.855
I've been pulling
the strings all along.

02:22.828 --> 02:25.563
<i>For a spy, the worst thing</i>
<i>that can happen</i>

02:25.631 --> 02:27.866
<i>is to become</i>
<i>someone else's asset.</i>

02:27.933 --> 02:30.335
<i>You do anything you can</i>
<i>to avoid it,</i>

02:30.403 --> 02:33.271
<i>making sure there's nothing</i>
<i>people can grab onto</i>

02:33.339 --> 02:34.773
<i>and use as leverage.</i>

02:34.840 --> 02:37.142
<i>You move through life</i>
<i>unattached,</i>

02:37.209 --> 02:39.411
<i>keeping the world</i>
<i>at a distance.</i>

02:39.478 --> 02:42.981
<i>It's a hard way to live,</i>
<i>but there's a cold logic to it.</i>

02:43.049 --> 02:44.382
<i>Love nothing,</i>

02:44.450 --> 02:47.719
<i>and nothing you love</i>
<i>can be used against you.</i>

02:47.787 --> 02:49.688
<i>Once you violate that rule</i>

02:49.755 --> 02:52.557
<i>and make that connection</i>
<i>with someone,</i>

02:52.625 --> 02:55.093
<i>you've handed your enemies</i>
<i>the key to destroying you.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here

03:07.373 --> 03:10.208
I want to get the ball rolling
on your security review.

03:10.276 --> 03:11.943
Question one --

03:13.446 --> 03:15.313
I'd like to ask
the first question, actually.

03:15.381 --> 03:16.915
The fact that
I'm being evaluated

03:16.982 --> 03:20.085
for a higher clearance,
does that mean that --

03:20.152 --> 03:21.319
All this means
is that D.C. likes

03:21.387 --> 03:22.854
having someone
who can work off the books.

03:22.922 --> 03:24.856
Last time I checked,
that was illegal.

03:24.924 --> 03:26.291
It pushes the boundaries.

03:26.359 --> 03:28.927
But I'd say, in light
of your recent activities,

03:28.994 --> 03:31.463
you're in no position to be
too squeamish about laws.

03:32.765 --> 03:34.933
After all,
that's what they like about you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.868
Oh, and one more thing.

03:36.936 --> 03:38.737
Just remember that a team
of agents

03:38.804 --> 03:41.639
is going to quadruple-check
everything you say here today.

03:41.707 --> 03:44.342
So do yourself a favor.
Stick to the truth for a change.

03:47.046 --> 03:48.246
Question one.

03:48.314 --> 03:50.582
Mr. Westen, we're aware
of your past affiliation

03:50.649 --> 03:52.550
with a rogue network
of burned spies.

03:52.618 --> 03:54.119
To the best
of your knowledge,

03:54.186 --> 03:56.187
does any trace of that network
still exist?

03:58.224 --> 03:59.724
No.

04:01.327 --> 04:03.495
All of that's over now.

04:10.236 --> 04:11.870
You're late.
I was starting to worry.

04:11.937 --> 04:12.871
How'd your meeting go?

04:12.938 --> 04:14.038
None of your business.

04:14.106 --> 04:15.473
Oh, but it is.
It is.

04:15.541 --> 04:17.175
It is absolutely
my business

04:17.243 --> 04:19.644
because while
there may be some doubt about

04:19.712 --> 04:21.478
whether you work
for the CIA,

04:21.547 --> 04:25.617
there's absolutely no doubt
that you work for me.

04:25.684 --> 04:28.353
So, I will ask again.
How did your meeting go?

04:28.421 --> 04:32.056
It went fine.

04:32.124 --> 04:33.391
What do you want?

04:35.795 --> 04:37.295
See, I have a problem.

04:37.363 --> 04:39.998
I spent most of
my career staying...

04:40.065 --> 04:42.066
Well, invisible,
off the radar.

04:42.134 --> 04:45.103
And then you started
shining lights in dark corners

04:45.171 --> 04:46.604
that should have
stayed dark.

04:46.672 --> 04:48.406
And now, as a result
of your efforts,

04:48.474 --> 04:52.177
my bank accounts and other bits
of personal information

04:52.244 --> 04:55.613
are in CIA computers,
and I don't want them there.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.949
That's already done.
There's nothing I can do.

04:58.017 --> 04:59.584
Oh, don't be
such a pessimist.

04:59.652 --> 05:00.752
Of course there is.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.520
Have you ever heard of
Voidbot?

05:02.588 --> 05:05.590
It's this nifty little bit
of malware

05:05.658 --> 05:07.692
that can scrub
all trace of a person

05:07.760 --> 05:09.994
off of a computer system
undetectably.

05:10.062 --> 05:12.864
I want you to get to
the man who created it

05:12.932 --> 05:14.299
and get us a copy.

05:14.366 --> 05:16.367
His name's
Oswald Patterson.

05:16.435 --> 05:18.403
Hold on.
He's in Puerto Rico?

05:18.471 --> 05:19.637
Sorry, I can't travel.

05:19.705 --> 05:21.506
The CIA's watching me
too closely.

05:21.574 --> 05:23.508
Michael.

05:23.576 --> 05:25.877
I saw your psych eval.

05:25.945 --> 05:29.147
I know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

05:29.215 --> 05:31.416
Or, in this case,
anything <i>I</i> set your mind to.

05:33.185 --> 05:35.587
Don't do it for me, Mikey.
Do it for love.

05:37.289 --> 05:38.623
Do it for Fiona.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.824
Forget it.

05:58.891 --> 06:01.092
I don't think you should
do anything for that parasite.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.494
I don't think
I have a choice.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.362
Of course you have a choice.
You can say no.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.765
You can tell the CIA
all about Anson and --

06:06.833 --> 06:08.433
And watch you go to jail
for the rest of your life

06:08.501 --> 06:09.634
for something
you didn't do?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.136
I can't do that, Fi.

06:12.738 --> 06:15.073
Uh, okay.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.241
Uh, what do we got here?
What's the plan?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.375
I don't think
there is one.

06:17.443 --> 06:18.677
I got have to go
to Puerto Rico

06:18.744 --> 06:21.146
and grab the guy we need
to get Anson his virus.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.114
- Well, then I'm going with you.
- Fi.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.816
I'm not some damsel in distress,
Michael.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.952
Have you read that file?

06:27.019 --> 06:28.553
This hacker
that you're after

06:28.621 --> 06:30.856
has his own little private army
of bodyguards.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.624
We'll both go, then.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.192
Okay, well,
while you're doing that,

06:34.260 --> 06:35.961
someone should check and see
what the police know about Fi.

06:36.028 --> 06:38.697
I don't care how many
cop buddies you have, Sam.

06:38.764 --> 06:40.098
You can't just go in there
and ask about --

06:40.166 --> 06:41.433
I wasn't planning on that.

06:41.500 --> 06:42.601
I got a thing,

06:42.668 --> 06:43.702
a little something Jesse
and me cooked up.

06:43.769 --> 06:45.170
But, uh, the thing is,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.239
it's gonna take someone
who can fly under the radar.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.008
Someone we trust. Someone
who knows the deal, you know?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.343
I don't know.

06:51.410 --> 06:53.912
You know, maybe someone who's...
A little older.

06:55.781 --> 06:56.882
My mom, Sam?

06:56.949 --> 06:59.851
Mike, what a great idea.
I'll talk to her.

06:59.919 --> 07:03.154
Here's to good plans
in bad situations.

07:11.464 --> 07:13.498
You want me to
steal what?

07:13.566 --> 07:15.233
Listen,
it's not really stealing.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.569
It's more like, uh,
uh, borrowing without asking.

07:17.637 --> 07:18.937
Yes.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.806
Borrowing without asking
from the police.

07:21.874 --> 07:24.376
Isn't this just gonna get
Michael in even more trouble?

07:24.443 --> 07:26.578
Well, no, see,
since I set you up

07:26.646 --> 07:27.846
with this sweet,
little fake I.D.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.081
So it won't lead back
to him or you.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.320
This thing lists me
at age 52.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.322
Yeah, well, you know,
a good cover I.D.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.757
Lists the age
that you look,

07:38.824 --> 07:41.359
not the age you are.

07:43.095 --> 07:44.829
And a good spy
knows how to flatter.

07:44.897 --> 07:45.964
Fine, I'll do it.

07:46.032 --> 07:47.866
And may I ask,
where is Michael?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.067
I-it's, uh --

07:49.135 --> 07:50.635
He's -- where is he?
He's on a trip.

07:50.703 --> 07:51.569
- Trip.
- That's it.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.071
Whatever.

07:56.870 --> 08:00.139
<i>When operating without official</i>
<i>cover in remote locations,</i>

08:00.207 --> 08:03.175
<i>you don't have resources</i>
<i>or backup if things go wrong.</i>

08:03.243 --> 08:05.277
<i>So it's usually best</i>
<i>to move fast</i>

08:05.345 --> 08:08.080
<i>and stay exposed</i>
<i>for as little time as possible.</i>

08:08.148 --> 08:09.348
<i>It's just a matter of</i>

08:09.416 --> 08:10.783
<i>figuring out</i>
<i>what you're up against,</i>

08:10.851 --> 08:12.251
<i>crossing your fingers,</i>

08:12.319 --> 08:14.954
<i>and getting in and out</i>
<i>as quickly as you can.</i>

08:15.022 --> 08:17.723
Well, Oswald sure knows
how to stay protected.

08:17.791 --> 08:19.258
I count four armed guards

08:19.326 --> 08:21.594
covering just the rear
of the compound.

08:21.661 --> 08:24.063
Michael, you're sure
you want to do this now?

08:24.131 --> 08:26.599
We could wait and see
what Sam and Jesse find.

08:26.666 --> 08:28.567
I mean, if I'm past saving,
what's the point?

08:28.635 --> 08:30.503
We have to assume
we can get you out of this.

08:30.570 --> 08:31.904
What if we can't?

08:31.972 --> 08:33.839
I've been
past saving before, Fi.

08:33.907 --> 08:36.375
You didn't walk away,
and I'm not going to.

08:36.443 --> 08:38.443
Well, that's terribly
romantic, Michael.

08:38.511 --> 08:40.813
But we don't have the numbers
nor the firepower

08:40.881 --> 08:42.347
to get through
those guards.

08:42.416 --> 08:43.682
Maybe we can
get around them.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.084
If you set a diversion
out front,

08:45.152 --> 08:46.652
I can make an approach
from the water,

08:46.720 --> 08:49.255
grab Oswald before anyone
even knows I'm there.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.792
Please, Fi.

08:55.762 --> 08:57.396
Don't look at me
like that.

08:57.464 --> 09:00.666
It's unsettling
when you're that sincere.

09:00.734 --> 09:03.069
Fine, yes.
I'll get the guns.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.845
<i>Creating a good diversion</i>

09:05.913 --> 09:08.214
<i>isn't just about making noise</i>
<i>and firing guns.</i>

09:08.282 --> 09:10.150
<i>It's about giving the enemy</i>
<i>the impression</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:11.885
<i>that he's being attacked</i>
<i>by a force</i>

09:11.953 --> 09:13.520
<i>that demands</i>
<i>the immediate attention</i>

09:13.588 --> 09:15.188
<i>of all his forces.</i>

09:16.724 --> 09:19.793
<i>Ideally, something big</i>
<i>and very, very loud.</i>

09:23.497 --> 09:25.932
Michael, the window's open.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.534
All right, Fi.

09:27.602 --> 09:29.336
I'll meet you a mile up
on the beach.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.952
Just go! Go, go, go!
Get out there!

09:46.020 --> 09:49.456
What am I paying you for?!
Go! Go!

09:51.192 --> 09:52.258
Oh!

09:52.326 --> 09:54.027
Shh, shh, shh!

09:54.095 --> 09:55.161
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

09:55.229 --> 09:57.230
Oh, my God.

10:02.503 --> 10:03.470
Ohh!

10:03.537 --> 10:06.473
Tie your hands.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.208
Tie your hands!
Get up.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.377
Get up!

10:11.679 --> 10:13.046
You need to learn
to follow directions.

10:13.114 --> 10:16.216
Be quiet.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.684
Is this about money?
Because I have money.

10:17.752 --> 10:19.052
This is about software.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.286
Software?

10:20.354 --> 10:21.955
You got some
bad information, man.

10:22.023 --> 10:23.456
I-I don't know anything
about software.

10:23.524 --> 10:24.891
Well, then we need to go
to Miami.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.526
No, no, no. No, no.
We can't go to Miami.

10:26.594 --> 10:27.894
Listen,
let's talk about it.

10:27.962 --> 10:30.296
Oh, please, please!
You're making a mistake, okay?

10:30.364 --> 10:32.432
My name is Carlos Buñuel.
Ch-check my wallet.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.968
Carlos is the cover I.D.
the government gave you.

10:35.036 --> 10:36.770
Your real name
is Oswald Patterson.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.038
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:38.105 --> 10:39.739
I cannot swim
with my hands tied!

10:39.807 --> 10:40.740
You're not swimming.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.279
You're gonna float.

10:57.997 --> 11:00.271
Praying isn't gonna help
the situation.

11:00.272 --> 11:03.041
Praying?
That's cute.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.442
I'm actually
playing chess.

11:04.510 --> 11:06.711
It's not that easy to keep
a board straight in your head,

11:06.779 --> 11:07.912
so if you
wanted to leave me alone,

11:07.980 --> 11:09.314
I'd really appreciate it.

11:09.381 --> 11:11.583
Happy to as soon as I get
the Voidbot software.

11:11.650 --> 11:12.750
Well...

11:12.818 --> 11:14.786
Okay, maybe you should
write this down

11:14.853 --> 11:16.888
so I don't have to keep
repeating myself.

11:16.956 --> 11:19.357
But I don't have it!

11:19.425 --> 11:22.460
Oswald, you can't just
keep lying to me forever.

11:22.528 --> 11:24.495
Okay, well,
I am not talking.

11:24.563 --> 11:29.200
Unstoppable force,
meet immovable object.

11:29.268 --> 11:31.636
Fine.

11:32.938 --> 11:35.373
- Let's just forget it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:35.441 --> 11:37.308
Uh, uh, before we start
torturing each other, all right,

11:37.376 --> 11:40.044
can we just talk about this?

11:40.112 --> 11:41.179
My guards
saw you abduct me!

11:41.247 --> 11:43.581
You are actually right,
Oswald.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.216
I owe you an apology.

11:45.284 --> 11:47.051
I owe you an apology...

11:47.119 --> 11:48.419
No, no.

11:48.487 --> 11:51.155
...'cause I feel like
I have made a terrible mistake.

11:51.223 --> 11:52.590
What mistake? No.
Please!

11:55.394 --> 11:57.362
Let's go for a walk.

11:59.498 --> 12:01.933
So, what now?

12:02.001 --> 12:04.736
I let you go, Oswald.

12:04.803 --> 12:05.970
Okay, good.
I think that's a good choice.

12:07.406 --> 12:08.573
You didn't r--
I'm sorry. Who are you calling?

12:08.641 --> 12:10.942
The police to confess
that I kidnapped you.

12:11.010 --> 12:12.377
That's Patterson
with two t's, right?

12:12.444 --> 12:13.911
Oh, no, no. That's not --
that's not necessary.

12:13.979 --> 12:15.079
No,
everyone needs to know

12:15.147 --> 12:16.118
that you're safe
and here in Miami.

12:16.119 --> 12:17.153
I think I'm gonna call
<i>The Herald.</i>

12:17.154 --> 12:18.588
- You know, the newspapers --
- Stop!

12:18.656 --> 12:20.023
Stop, okay?
Just stop.

12:20.090 --> 12:22.625
Do you know what kind of people
live on islands?

12:22.693 --> 12:24.861
In heavily guarded homes
under fake names?

12:24.929 --> 12:26.196
Hunted people, Oswald.

12:26.263 --> 12:27.497
So if you want me
to let you go

12:27.565 --> 12:30.467
and you take your chances
with your enemies, fine.

12:30.534 --> 12:32.802
Otherwise, tell me
where the virus is.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.042
All right, can we sit?

12:39.109 --> 12:41.044
Please? Can we...

12:43.481 --> 12:45.782
So a little bit of history.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.485
My specialty was hacking
financial systems.

12:48.552 --> 12:50.687
So one day I got a call
from this guy named Xavier.

12:50.754 --> 12:52.288
He's a cocaine --
I don't know --

12:52.356 --> 12:53.923
wholesaler, I guess?

12:53.991 --> 12:55.625
He wants to go all cash
and needs my help to,

12:55.693 --> 12:57.427
uh, erase his name
from international,

12:57.495 --> 12:58.761
uh, banking systems.

12:58.829 --> 13:00.797
Uh, pays $10 million --
$5 million up front,

13:00.865 --> 13:03.132
$5 million on delivery --
to write this program

13:03.200 --> 13:04.467
to erase
all of his information

13:04.535 --> 13:05.969
from the government's
computers.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.404
- That was Voidbot.
- Yeah.

13:08.472 --> 13:09.672
The problem is,

13:09.740 --> 13:12.542
before I can deliver it,
I get busted by the FBI.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.844
So I made a deal, the Feds
confiscated the program...

13:14.912 --> 13:16.246
And now
it's stuck in a lab?

13:16.313 --> 13:17.881
See, well, that's the thing,
though.

13:17.948 --> 13:19.115
I've got a way in.

13:19.183 --> 13:21.551
I built a back door
for myself --

13:21.619 --> 13:24.387
uh, key cards,
access codes just to get in

13:24.455 --> 13:26.089
in case, um, I need to.

13:26.156 --> 13:29.292
Uh, I left that stuff with uh,
a-a-an associate?

13:29.360 --> 13:31.895
I guess it's time to get
in touch with this associate.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.964
No --
what's up, Sam?

13:35.032 --> 13:36.399
Oh, just checking to see
how things are going

13:36.467 --> 13:37.567
with your hacker buddy.

13:37.635 --> 13:38.835
We're making progress.

13:38.903 --> 13:39.969
Well, that's good.

13:40.037 --> 13:41.504
So, listen, uh,
me and Jesse

13:41.572 --> 13:43.973
are about to start teaching
your ma some spy craft 101.

13:44.041 --> 13:45.608
Just wanted to make sure
everything's still a go.

13:45.676 --> 13:46.743
It's a go, Sam.

13:46.810 --> 13:48.077
You got it, Mikey.

13:49.547 --> 13:51.848
Okay,
all systems are go.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.416
I pulled some strings,

13:53.484 --> 13:55.285
got a meeting with the detective
working the consulate bombing.

13:55.352 --> 13:57.086
You're gonna get us access
to his laptop

13:57.154 --> 13:59.088
so we can see
if they're after Fi.

13:59.156 --> 14:01.190
How am I gonna do that? I barely
know how to turn this thing on.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.393
You're gonna get the data
off the dram chip.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.827
Oh!

14:04.895 --> 14:06.563
Dynamic random
access memory.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.064
Basically,
it's a circuit --

14:08.132 --> 14:09.832
Spare me the computer talk.
Just show me what to do.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.101
Okay.
Watch and learn.

14:12.169 --> 14:14.170
<i>Information stored</i>
<i>in a dram chip</i>

14:14.238 --> 14:17.674
<i>was long considered</i>
<i>impossible to steal.</i>

14:17.741 --> 14:20.343
<i>It's automatically erased</i>
<i>when the chip's removed.</i>

14:20.411 --> 14:23.179
And then after
you transfer the information,

14:23.247 --> 14:24.647
you have to get the chip
back in the laptop.

14:24.715 --> 14:27.116
Okay, so, your turn.
The whole thing, the whole bit.

14:27.184 --> 14:28.685
Don't rush me.

14:28.752 --> 14:31.821
<i>The one way to preserve</i>
<i>the information in a dram chip</i>

14:31.889 --> 14:33.456
<i>is by freezing it</i>
<i>immediately after</i>

14:33.524 --> 14:34.824
<i>you take it</i>
<i>out of the computer.</i>

14:34.892 --> 14:36.693
<i>A quick application</i>
<i>of compressed air</i>

14:36.760 --> 14:38.861
<i>from your local drug store</i>
<i>will keep the memory intact</i>

14:38.929 --> 14:40.830
<i>long enough</i>
<i>to get what you need.</i>

14:40.898 --> 14:43.032
That's -- that's plenty.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.101
<i>It's possible,</i>
<i>but far from easy.</i>

14:45.169 --> 14:48.738
<i>And if you don't want to get</i>
<i>caught, it takes some practice.</i>

14:48.806 --> 14:50.873
- There! I did it!
- Okay, good.

14:50.941 --> 14:52.809
Now you have to do it until
you can do it under pressure

14:52.876 --> 14:55.011
without these.

14:55.079 --> 14:56.779
They're not gonna let you
smoke in there, Maddy.

14:59.917 --> 15:00.984
Fine.

15:01.051 --> 15:03.786
If I can't smoke,
you can't drink my beer.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.791
Let's do it again.

15:11.629 --> 15:13.062
Yeah, I heard you guys
were looking for anybody

15:13.130 --> 15:14.664
that knew anything
about the consulate bomb.

15:14.732 --> 15:16.099
I used to be with CIFA,

15:16.166 --> 15:17.734
so I figured
I'd try to pitch in.

15:17.801 --> 15:20.236
I see.
How did you two cross paths?

15:20.304 --> 15:22.672
Oh, Jesse's girlfriend
does my hair.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.007
Oh.

15:24.074 --> 15:26.542
Um, and, so, I was talking
about what I saw,

15:26.610 --> 15:27.877
and he gave me a call

15:27.945 --> 15:29.679
and said that I should
get in touch with you.

15:29.747 --> 15:31.648
Yeah, my lady made me
tag along for support.

15:31.715 --> 15:33.750
- You know how it is.
- I understand.

15:33.817 --> 15:34.984
This is our stop.

15:40.224 --> 15:42.592
Miss Brown, did you notice
anything else unusual

15:42.660 --> 15:45.094
or out of the ordinary
on your walk that afternoon?

15:45.162 --> 15:47.196
Uh, no...not really.

15:47.264 --> 15:48.564
Uh...

15:48.632 --> 15:50.733
Would you mind looking through
some mug shots?

15:50.801 --> 15:52.168
Just to see if you
recognize anybody?

15:53.937 --> 15:55.471
Whew, gosh.

15:55.539 --> 15:56.739
That's a lot.

15:56.807 --> 15:58.141
Oh, uh, take your time.
Take your time.

16:02.346 --> 16:04.881
Um...

16:04.948 --> 16:06.149
I'm sorry.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.551
It's just I don't want to
pick the wrong person.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.253
I'd never
forgive myself.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.056
You know what?
Why don't we go grab a soda?

16:13.123 --> 16:16.192
Give her a little
breathing room, huh?

16:16.260 --> 16:17.160
Um...Sure.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.495
We'll be right back.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.897
Thank you.

16:28.572 --> 16:30.907
<i>When you need to buy time</i>

16:38.882 --> 16:39.982
Uh...
Let's go full diesel.

16:40.050 --> 16:41.184
I deserve a little treat.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.318
I've been doing
these new crunches.

16:42.386 --> 16:43.786
There's this new ab workout.

16:43.854 --> 16:45.181
It's called "crunch drunk."
You heard of it?

16:45.182 --> 16:45.555
No.

16:45.556 --> 16:48.057
Dude. It's hardcore.
Feel my stomach.

- We should be getting back.
- Actually, you know what?

16:58.335 --> 17:01.370
Let's go with...
Cherry soda.

17:01.438 --> 17:04.181
Feeling a little crazy.
Feeling a little wacky.

17:04.205 --> 17:05.406
Okay.

17:05.976 --> 17:08.310
No, scratch that. Scratch that.
Scratch that. Let's go diet. Diet.

17:08.377 --> 17:09.579
Okay.

17:15.018 --> 17:17.053
So, uh -- so how about you,
Detective?

17:17.121 --> 17:19.055
Do you hit the gym
at all?

17:19.123 --> 17:22.625
Oh, I curl donuts.
Lots of donuts.

17:27.431 --> 17:30.867
Excuse me, ma'am?
May I ask what you're doing?

17:30.934 --> 17:32.602
Putting something
in your purse there?

17:32.669 --> 17:34.070
You want to tell me
what that is?

17:34.138 --> 17:35.905
Caught me.

17:38.542 --> 17:41.277
It's my cigarettes.
Trying to sneak one.

17:44.181 --> 17:45.882
- Sorry.
- I'll tell you what.

17:45.949 --> 17:47.283
I'll...pretend
like I didn't see it.

17:47.351 --> 17:48.985
Thank you.

17:49.052 --> 17:50.887
There you go.

17:50.954 --> 17:52.321
Uh...you see anybody
you recognize?

17:52.389 --> 17:54.624
I think --
I think I remember this man.

17:56.360 --> 17:59.462
Um...or maybe that's him.

17:59.530 --> 18:01.597
This one.

18:01.665 --> 18:05.334
Yeah.
I really can't be sure.

18:05.402 --> 18:09.005
You know what?
Um...I think we got all we need.

18:09.072 --> 18:10.239
Thanks for coming in.

18:22.486 --> 18:24.821
That's it.
Yellow one.

18:24.888 --> 18:28.424
This is where
your "associate" lives?

18:28.492 --> 18:30.159
Care to elaborate
on this associate?

18:30.227 --> 18:31.561
Uh, no, actually,
thank you.

18:31.628 --> 18:33.596
I do not care to elaborate
on this associate.

18:33.664 --> 18:35.398
I care to get in,
get my access cards,

18:35.465 --> 18:37.200
and get out
as soon as possible.

18:37.267 --> 18:39.168
Whoo.
Touchy, touchy.

18:39.236 --> 18:42.972
He has enemies.
Don't take it personally.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.407
Actually,
you can take that personally.

18:44.474 --> 18:47.343
You are both firmly
in the "enemy" column right now.

18:47.411 --> 18:48.778
Baby cakes! Hey.

18:48.846 --> 18:50.146
You look great.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.948
You look like
hammered crap.

18:54.852 --> 18:57.486
Just get inside, Oswald.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.322
I'll deal with this.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.859
You keep an eye on the street,
baby cakes.

19:02.926 --> 19:06.429
Oh, love
what you've done here.

19:06.496 --> 19:08.764
Very tech-geek chic.

19:08.832 --> 19:11.968
Baby cakes,
um, where's that TV?

19:12.035 --> 19:13.035
The one I bought you?
The vintage?

19:13.103 --> 19:14.370
That dinosaur?

19:14.438 --> 19:15.972
No, I'm streaming everything
through these bad boys.

19:16.039 --> 19:18.174
See, they get 100 times
the resolution.

19:18.242 --> 19:20.977
Why -- um, wouldn't...
You tell me

19:21.044 --> 19:23.179
that you stopped using
that television?

19:23.247 --> 19:25.147
The only contact
we have these days

19:25.215 --> 19:27.583
is when we're questing
in "World of Warcraft."

19:27.651 --> 19:28.885
Why would I tell you

19:28.952 --> 19:30.853
how I'm decorating
my living room?

19:30.921 --> 19:33.189
That TV
is extremely important!

19:33.257 --> 19:34.624
Do not tell me --

19:34.691 --> 19:37.393
Well, you didn't say
it was important!

19:37.461 --> 19:38.594
You just sent it to me

19:38.662 --> 19:40.496
with a card that said,
"Happy Birthday."

19:40.564 --> 19:42.265
This is your problem,
Oswald!

19:42.332 --> 19:45.001
We're gonna have to deal
with your issues later.

19:45.068 --> 19:47.803
Right now, I need to know
where those cards are.

19:47.871 --> 19:50.506
The cards are in the television
that I gave her.

19:50.574 --> 19:52.642
I thought --

19:52.709 --> 19:54.310
I thought it would be
a good idea to hide them

19:54.378 --> 19:57.446
somewhere in Miami in case
I need to get to them.

19:57.514 --> 19:58.848
Where is the TV now?

19:58.916 --> 20:00.316
In storage.

20:01.385 --> 20:03.319
A place across town.

20:03.387 --> 20:05.021
I have a key, but --

20:07.324 --> 20:09.225
Michael.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.493
Did you get the key cards?

20:10.560 --> 20:13.930
No. We hit a little snag
in here.

20:13.997 --> 20:15.531
Well, we're about to hit
a big snag out here.

20:15.599 --> 20:18.434
Two armored S.U.V.s
are headed this way.

20:18.502 --> 20:21.270
I think Oswald's friend Xavier
just caught up to us.

20:21.338 --> 20:23.506
Meet me at the side
of the house --- now.

20:27.044 --> 20:29.345
Can either of you tell me

20:29.413 --> 20:31.881
why the coke dealer that you
pissed off just showed up?

20:32.983 --> 20:35.084
What did you do?

20:35.152 --> 20:36.919
I'm so sorry, Ozzy.

20:36.987 --> 20:38.287
Oh, no.

20:38.355 --> 20:41.257
You promised that he wouldn't
find me, but he did.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.492
And he said
if you ever came back

20:43.560 --> 20:45.795
and I didn't tell him,
I was dead.

20:45.862 --> 20:48.197
I'm so sorry.
I screwed this whole thing up.

20:48.265 --> 20:49.699
This is gonna have to wait.

20:49.766 --> 20:51.634
We need to move right now,

20:51.702 --> 20:52.601
or we're all gonna die
right here.

21:02.079 --> 21:04.180
- We got another S.U.V.
- coming up third.

21:09.086 --> 21:11.454
The street
is completely blocked.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.622
Three guys in the back alley,
too. This is bad.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.991
You guys, we're dead.
We are dead!

21:15.058 --> 21:18.227
- Calm down.
- Look, Xavier wants the software,

21:18.295 --> 21:19.729
so he's probably planning
on taking you alive.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.998
And that's --
that's a good thing?

21:22.065 --> 21:23.232
Yeah, it gives us a way
out of here.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.736
One you're not gonna like,
though.

21:26.803 --> 21:27.837
All right, fan out.

21:27.904 --> 21:29.505
I don't want
the little weasel

21:29.573 --> 21:31.907
popping out a window
and making a run for it.

21:31.975 --> 21:33.409
<i>In a situation where you're</i>
<i>trying to keep someone</i>

21:33.477 --> 21:34.744
<i>from being captured,</i>

21:34.811 --> 21:36.712
<i>your best leverage</i>
<i>is often the life</i>

21:36.780 --> 21:38.781
<i>of the very person</i>
<i>you're trying to protect.</i>

21:38.849 --> 21:40.883
Everybody back off...

21:40.951 --> 21:41.917
Aah!

21:41.985 --> 21:43.552
...or I drop him
right now.

21:43.620 --> 21:45.888
<i>The trick</i>
<i>is convincing the bad guys</i>

21:45.956 --> 21:47.757
<i>that you're willing</i>
<i>to kill their prize</i>

21:47.824 --> 21:49.425
<i>before you let them have it.</i>

21:49.493 --> 21:52.261
Xavier, I presume.
Nice suit.

21:52.329 --> 21:55.064
Thanks. But we've got
a big problem here.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.568
Feel like telling me
who you are?

21:59.636 --> 22:01.103
That's not important.
What is important

22:01.171 --> 22:02.872
is that you need this man alive
and I do not.

22:02.939 --> 22:05.541
Put down your weapons
or he dies.

22:05.609 --> 22:06.842
Aah! Come on!

22:06.910 --> 22:10.846
The next one's in his skull.
Drop your weapon now.

22:24.494 --> 22:25.694
Very good.

22:29.232 --> 22:31.567
This is a mistake.

22:31.635 --> 22:33.436
You don't want to make me
your enemy.

22:33.503 --> 22:36.072
And you don't want to make me
make him a corpse.

22:36.139 --> 22:38.474
Back off, friend.

22:40.043 --> 22:43.179
You better keep him
in one piece. He's mine.

22:43.246 --> 22:47.149
And whoever you are...
I'll see you soon.

22:57.469 --> 23:00.227
Oh God.
This isn't good.

23:00.228 --> 23:02.396
Are you sure Xavier
can't find us?

23:02.553 --> 23:04.032
We're safe here.

23:04.033 --> 23:06.000
Michael's checking
with some of our contacts

23:06.068 --> 23:07.835
to see how wide
Xavier's reach is.

23:07.903 --> 23:10.138
I can tell you it's wide enough
to relocate to Puerto Rico.

23:10.205 --> 23:11.806
You know,
maybe it's time we consider --

23:11.874 --> 23:14.108
You're staying in Miami
until we get those key cards.

23:14.176 --> 23:16.064
Sherry, you're sure the TV's
still in your storage unit?

23:16.089 --> 23:17.078
Yeah, yeah.

23:17.079 --> 23:19.180
And I have the only key,
so the TV is still inside.

23:19.248 --> 23:21.249
Well, at this point, Xavier
knows you're part of this.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.985
Chances are he knows
you're renting a storage unit.

23:24.053 --> 23:26.988
Um, you know, Sherry
didn't sign up for any of this.

23:27.056 --> 23:29.657
Is there a way we can
just get her out of town or...?

23:29.725 --> 23:32.093
Well, I have
an import/export friend

23:32.161 --> 23:33.494
maybe he could help.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.430
Import/export?

23:35.497 --> 23:38.232
That means smuggling.
That's how they got me here.

23:38.300 --> 23:39.500
You like boats?

23:45.808 --> 23:47.775
That's my friend, Louis.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.777
He'll take you
to the Dominican Republic.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.913
Is Oswald
gonna be okay?

23:51.980 --> 23:54.916
I think so. He's in trouble, but
Michael's good with trouble.

23:54.983 --> 23:57.385
You probably think I'm crazy
for liking Oswald

23:57.453 --> 23:59.721
but -- do you know
how we met?

23:59.788 --> 24:02.223
I cracked his online account
at a music store

24:02.291 --> 24:03.825
and stole
his credit card.

24:03.892 --> 24:06.794
He tracked me down
and asked me out.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.197
There aren't a lot of guys
like that.

24:09.264 --> 24:13.735
It's not ideal, but I kind of
can't help but love him.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.308
You'll take care of him,
then?

24:20.376 --> 24:21.642
We'll do our best.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.912
Bon voyage!

24:28.217 --> 24:31.052
So, you find anything?

24:31.120 --> 24:33.121
Uh, not yet.

24:33.188 --> 24:34.789
Beer.

24:34.857 --> 24:35.957
And a single malt scotch.

24:36.024 --> 24:37.258
Uh...
Um, yeah, no.

24:37.326 --> 24:38.593
I'm sorry. That's a mistake.
We didn't order that.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.694
It's from
the gentleman over there.

24:43.665 --> 24:46.634
Anson, great to see you.
What do you want?

24:46.702 --> 24:49.470
Did I -- did I get
your drinks right?

24:49.538 --> 24:51.472
Yes?
I'm so happy.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.641
Mm, look who's been
doing research!

24:53.709 --> 24:55.810
Checking into what
the police have on Fiona.

24:55.878 --> 24:58.246
Good for you. It's always best
to see for yourself.

24:58.313 --> 25:01.015
But may I save you some time
with the executive summary?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.217
The police hit a dead-end
tracking the explosives.

25:03.285 --> 25:05.119
The surveillance cameras
turned up nothing,

25:05.187 --> 25:06.554
and there
were no eyewitnesses.

25:06.622 --> 25:09.090
The investigation's at a
standstill. Yeah, we got that.

25:09.158 --> 25:11.426
Oh, that's a half-empty way
of looking at it, Mr. Porter.

25:11.493 --> 25:12.927
I prefer to think
that the police

25:12.995 --> 25:15.263
are a few missing clues away
from solving the case --

25:15.330 --> 25:17.498
clues which I currently hold.
Goody for you.

25:17.566 --> 25:21.035
Well, it will be when I get
the software that I asked for.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.637
- Yeah, Mike's working on that.
- Wonderful.

25:22.704 --> 25:24.872
Please tell him
that Fiona's completely safe

25:24.940 --> 25:26.607
so long as he succeeds.

25:26.675 --> 25:28.409
Oh, and in case either of you
have any ideas

25:28.477 --> 25:31.279
about, um, coming after me,
please be aware

25:31.346 --> 25:34.582
I know a lot more about you
than your favorite drinks.

25:36.151 --> 25:38.686
Cheers.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.456
It's official --
the guy's a dick.

25:57.272 --> 25:58.773
Hands on the pipe,
Oswald.

25:58.841 --> 26:00.441
Seriously?

26:00.509 --> 26:03.311
Aren't we past the whole
zip cord phase?

26:03.378 --> 26:06.047
I don't like going into dark corners
with people I don't trust.

26:06.114 --> 26:07.642
Aren't we just picking up
the access cards?

26:07.667 --> 26:08.282
We are.

26:08.283 --> 26:10.618
If it helps,
think of yourself as a lookout,

26:10.686 --> 26:12.687
in case Xavier sends
someone here.

26:12.754 --> 26:13.672
What are the chances Xavier --

26:13.697 --> 26:16.108
Very high, and we already know
you like yelling.

26:16.124 --> 26:19.260
So if you see his guys,
do what comes naturally.

26:44.653 --> 26:45.786
Michael!

26:45.854 --> 26:47.054
Michael!

26:47.122 --> 26:48.623
Michael! Mike!
They're here!

26:51.994 --> 26:53.661
Where you going?

26:53.729 --> 26:55.429
Hey, where you going?
You're leaving me?!

26:55.497 --> 26:57.031
You're leaving me here?

26:57.099 --> 27:00.434
<i>When you're surprised by</i>
<i>an enemy who has you outgunned</i>

27:00.502 --> 27:03.504
<i>you're first instinct</i>
<i>is naturally going to be</i>

27:03.572 --> 27:05.172
<i>to try to run.</i>

27:05.240 --> 27:07.775
<i>This can be</i>
<i>a serious tactical mistake.</i>

27:07.843 --> 27:10.511
<i>Sometimes it's less important</i>
<i>to get away immediately...</i>

27:15.551 --> 27:18.953
<i>Than it is to make sure</i>
<i>your enemies can't follow.</i>

27:24.426 --> 27:27.495
Ha! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you so much!

27:27.563 --> 27:29.730
Oh, my God!
That was amazing!

27:29.798 --> 27:32.667
Yelling time is over!
Let's go!

27:54.222 --> 27:56.090
That's it?

27:56.158 --> 27:59.794
Yeah, it's a joint lab
for the HSA, FBI, and D.E.A.

27:59.861 --> 28:01.562
Okay.

28:01.630 --> 28:04.532
Uh, these are the key cards
for the front gate

28:04.600 --> 28:06.701
and that gets you past
the guard in the front.

28:06.768 --> 28:09.937
These access codes -- that's
for the lab and then the vault.

28:10.005 --> 28:12.106
You'll stay in the car
while I go in.

28:12.174 --> 28:14.909
Once I come out with the drive,
we will head down to the docks,

28:14.977 --> 28:16.110
and we'll
get you home.

28:23.785 --> 28:24.652
Wait!

28:26.188 --> 28:28.456
Wait.

28:28.523 --> 28:30.391
Let me ask you something.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.594
Why'd you come back for me,
back at the storage place?

28:33.662 --> 28:35.963
You had the codes.
You could have just...left me.

28:36.031 --> 28:38.265
It would have been easier than that
thing you did with the forklift.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.534
I mean, seriously.
What kind of thief are you?

28:40.602 --> 28:42.203
I'm not a thief.

28:42.270 --> 28:44.405
At least not by choice.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.641
- So you're being forced to do this?
- And I'm trying to do it

28:46.708 --> 28:49.310
with as little damage
as possible.

28:50.746 --> 28:54.081
Okay, you can't
go in there, man.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.416
You can't use
those key cards.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.418
You just said
they would work.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.354
Yes, you can go in there,
but you can't get away...

29:00.422 --> 29:02.289
without getting caught.

29:02.357 --> 29:05.192
Have you ever heard of
Micro-RFID trackers?

29:05.260 --> 29:07.628
Special forces uses them
to keep tabs on terrorists --

29:07.696 --> 29:09.230
about the size
of a grain of rice.

29:09.297 --> 29:11.832
Well, no,
they make them smaller now --

29:11.900 --> 29:13.100
much smaller.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.902
Okay, you take one step
in there

29:14.970 --> 29:16.370
I get tagged?

29:16.438 --> 29:18.906
Yeah. Okay, it's --
it's a fail-safe.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.008
I-I-it can't be hacked.

29:21.076 --> 29:22.643
It gets in your clothes
and your hair.

29:22.711 --> 29:24.745
As soon as you step outside
it transmits your location.

29:24.813 --> 29:27.381
They'll have a satellite tracking your
ass by the time you buckle up.

29:27.449 --> 29:28.716
And your telling me
this now?!

29:28.784 --> 29:30.651
Hey, back when you
were pointing guns at my face

29:30.719 --> 29:33.954
and kidnapping me, I wanted you
to get caught, okay?

29:34.022 --> 29:35.489
I changed my mind!

29:35.557 --> 29:38.492
So just tell whoever's behind
this that it's a no-go.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.996
You don't understand.
I can't fail.

29:42.064 --> 29:44.398
But if you
step in there...

29:44.466 --> 29:46.400
You're tagged.

29:46.468 --> 29:48.569
It's over.

29:48.637 --> 29:50.071
It's not over.

29:50.138 --> 29:52.406
If I can't go in there,

29:52.474 --> 29:54.742
I'll have to find someone
who can go in for me.

29:57.988 --> 30:00.546
Sam. Jesse. This is Oswald.

30:00.938 --> 30:02.973
Creator of Voidbot.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.741
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:04.809 --> 30:06.910
- Do any of your friends ever smile?
- Yes.

30:06.978 --> 30:08.545
- So where do we stand?
- Well, unfortunately,

30:08.613 --> 30:11.214
anybody who takes anything
out of the vault gets tagged,

30:11.282 --> 30:13.083
tracked by satellite,
and pounced on

30:13.151 --> 30:14.251
by a fleet
of FBI agents.

30:14.318 --> 30:18.021
Great. So what do we do,
just draw straws?

30:18.089 --> 30:20.023
No. We let Xavier
go get it.

30:20.091 --> 30:21.391
Wait a minute, what?

30:21.459 --> 30:23.493
As in "coke dealer
who wants you dead" Xavier?

30:23.561 --> 30:26.163
We know he wants it,
and when the FBI grabs him,

30:26.230 --> 30:28.465
we solve the
wanting-me-dead problem, too.

30:28.533 --> 30:30.267
Okay, but how do we
get the software from him

30:30.334 --> 30:31.501
with the satellites watching?

30:31.569 --> 30:34.237
We hit him someplace
the satellites can't see,

30:34.305 --> 30:36.039
make ourselves a copy.

30:36.080 --> 30:36.937
You're gonna call Xavier.

30:36.962 --> 30:38.603
You're gonna tell him you
escaped from me.

30:38.976 --> 30:41.311
You want to make a deal
by offering up Voidbot.

30:41.379 --> 30:43.713
You ask for a couple
hundred thousand dollars

30:43.781 --> 30:45.949
so he doesn't get suspicious.
- That's crazy!

30:46.017 --> 30:48.518
I-I've -- I've dedicated my life
to avoiding this man.

30:48.586 --> 30:51.488
And if you do this, he'll be
out of your life for good.

30:51.556 --> 30:53.023
And Sherry's, too.

30:54.358 --> 30:58.195
Fine, but this is a hell of
a way of repaying me

30:58.262 --> 30:59.663
for getting you out
of that lab.

30:59.730 --> 31:00.964
Hello.

31:01.032 --> 31:04.067
Uh...Hey, Xavier.

31:04.135 --> 31:07.637
Uh, can we make a deal?

31:12.577 --> 31:14.244
Oz, stay cool.

31:14.312 --> 31:17.514
This whole thing is gonna be
over in a few minutes.

31:17.582 --> 31:19.316
Okay, showtime.

31:19.383 --> 31:22.686
Okay, remind me again
what's preventing Xavier

31:22.753 --> 31:24.888
from just killing me
and taking the access codes?

31:24.956 --> 31:27.157
Don't panic. Jesse and I
are here to protect you.

31:27.225 --> 31:29.492
Okay. A-and
what if he kills you two?

31:29.560 --> 31:31.661
Oh, well, if that happens, yeah,
go ahead and panic.

31:31.729 --> 31:32.796
What?

31:44.775 --> 31:46.109
Okay,
that's good right there.

31:46.177 --> 31:48.211
We're gonna do this deal
at a nice,

31:48.279 --> 31:49.813
polite,
respectful distance.

31:49.880 --> 31:52.015
Respectful? No.

31:52.083 --> 31:54.618
This son of a bitch stole
$5 million dollars from me

31:54.685 --> 31:56.019
that's inaccurate.

31:56.087 --> 31:57.687
Look at it this way.
A few years back,

31:57.755 --> 31:59.623
you were gonna pay
$10 million for that virus.

31:59.690 --> 32:02.058
Instead, you're gonna pay what,
$5 million and change?

32:02.126 --> 32:03.727
Man, that sounds like
a bargain to me.

32:05.029 --> 32:06.429
Or, if you prefer,
you can shoot Ozzy,

32:06.497 --> 32:08.398
but that means
we got to shoot back,

32:08.466 --> 32:09.866
and then
a bunch of guys die,

32:09.934 --> 32:11.701
and you wasted all that cash
for nothing.

32:11.769 --> 32:13.637
So do we have a deal
or not?

32:18.643 --> 32:20.977
There we go.
Yeah, come on. There we go.

32:21.045 --> 32:22.245
Give him the money.

32:25.049 --> 32:27.884
Oz, come on.

32:30.688 --> 32:33.757
Okay, this is the card
for the front gate.

32:33.824 --> 32:36.293
This is the card for the guard
and the restricted zone.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.330
And this code will get you
in the lab and the vault.

32:40.398 --> 32:43.433
You think this is over?

32:43.501 --> 32:47.103
I'm gonna find you
and watch you die.

32:47.171 --> 32:48.805
Hey, hey. Enough of that.
We have a deal.

32:48.873 --> 32:50.206
You want to whisper
sweet nothings at Ozzy,

32:50.274 --> 32:51.941
that's gonna cost extra.

32:52.009 --> 32:53.877
Pleasure doing business
with you son of a bitches,

32:53.944 --> 32:55.078
we'll see you later.

32:55.146 --> 32:56.946
All right, stop right there.

32:57.014 --> 33:00.383
No one leaves until I walk out
of that place with the virus.

33:00.451 --> 33:02.352
Anything happens
to me in there?

33:02.420 --> 33:03.586
Everyone dies.

33:08.793 --> 33:12.929
<i>Active security systems</i>
<i>are built to keep people out.</i>

33:12.997 --> 33:15.198
<i>Passive systems,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

33:15.266 --> 33:17.367
<i>don't prevent</i>
<i>security breaches --</i>

33:17.435 --> 33:20.704
<i>they help you catch</i>
<i>the bad guy after he leaves.</i>

33:20.771 --> 33:22.839
<i>They're often cheaper</i>
<i>and more effective.</i>

33:22.907 --> 33:26.843
<i>Plus, they let you know</i>
<i>who your enemies are.</i>

33:26.911 --> 33:30.714
<i>Micro-RFID tags</i>
<i>work like anti-theft tags</i>

33:30.781 --> 33:32.916
<i>in department stores,</i>

33:32.983 --> 33:35.452
<i>only they're a lot smaller</i>
<i>and stick to clothes, shoes,</i>

33:35.519 --> 33:37.253
<i>and even hair.</i>

33:37.321 --> 33:41.424
<i>Once activated, they transmit</i>
<i>a response to a coded signal.</i>

33:41.492 --> 33:43.927
<i>From there, it's easy</i>
<i>for a surveillance satellite</i>

33:43.994 --> 33:46.496
<i>to lock on and follow</i>
<i>a high-value target.</i>

33:46.564 --> 33:48.064
We're good here.

33:48.132 --> 33:50.467
Okay.
It's been real.

33:50.534 --> 33:53.371
<i>And the best part is the target</i>
<i>never even knew it happed.</i>

33:54.138 --> 33:56.786
Xavier's got his toy
and is on the move.

33:56.807 --> 33:58.608
How you guys doing?
You set to go?

33:58.676 --> 33:59.769
Almost, Sam.
Where are they headed?

33:59.794 --> 34:00.944
It's hard to tell, Mikey.

34:00.945 --> 34:03.146
The S.U.V.'s are heading
in two different directions.

34:03.214 --> 34:06.449
Probably trying to avoid a tail.
Stay on them, Sam.

34:11.489 --> 34:12.824
Xavier's driving north.

34:12.850 --> 34:14.050
He's probably heading
for his place in Brickell.

34:14.358 --> 34:16.960
All right, that means you can cut
him off at 10th Street, Mike.

34:17.027 --> 34:18.261
No, there's too much
traffic there.

34:18.329 --> 34:19.763
14th will give us
more privacy.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.331
Well, I hope you're right,
Mikey,

34:21.399 --> 34:23.733
'cause the eyes in the sky
are gonna be watching by now.

34:23.801 --> 34:26.002
Yeah. Sounds like the word's
already out. The cops are scrambling.

34:26.070 --> 34:28.938
They see you with Xavier,
they're gonna sweep you up, too.

34:29.005 --> 34:30.806
<i>The age</i>
<i>of satellite surveillance</i>

34:30.875 --> 34:33.009
<i>has made some operations easier</i>
<i>for spies</i>

34:33.077 --> 34:34.677
<i>and a lot harder</i>
<i>for others.</i>

34:34.745 --> 34:36.646
<i>If you need to</i>
<i>secretly meet someone</i>

34:36.714 --> 34:38.614
<i>who's being tracked</i>
<i>by a satellite,</i>

34:38.681 --> 34:40.315
<i>your options</i>
<i>are pretty limited.</i>

34:40.384 --> 34:42.685
<i>The only move is to make sure</i>
<i>you're someplace</i>

34:42.753 --> 34:45.021
<i>the surveillance satellites</i>
<i>can't see you.</i>

34:45.089 --> 34:47.157
<i>That usually means a cave,</i>
<i>a tunnel,</i>

34:47.224 --> 34:49.492
<i>or, in a pinch,</i>
<i>a freeway overpass.</i>

34:49.560 --> 34:51.561
I think we have enough privacy
under here.

34:51.629 --> 34:53.396
See you soon.

34:53.464 --> 34:55.098
Okay, it's showtime

34:55.132 --> 34:58.568
we're set up just behind you about
half a mile south of the bridge.

34:58.636 --> 35:01.237
Xavier's headed our way.
How's our emergency response?

35:01.305 --> 35:02.806
We're cutting it close,
Mike.

35:02.873 --> 35:05.341
You got two, maybe three minutes
to copy that virus.

35:05.409 --> 35:07.844
If it takes longer than that,
we got bigger problems.

35:14.385 --> 35:20.190
Hey, buddy!
Get the hell out of our way!

35:20.257 --> 35:21.991
I actually have
a better idea.

35:22.059 --> 35:24.928
I was hoping you could hand over
the disk drive.

35:26.564 --> 35:29.599
Get back in the car, boys.
All right, drop them.

35:31.268 --> 35:33.236
It's cool, guys.
I got this.

35:33.304 --> 35:36.005
You son of a bitches
are robbing me?

35:36.073 --> 35:37.440
No need
for name-calling.

35:37.508 --> 35:39.542
We're just making a copy
of the disk.

35:39.610 --> 35:41.211
Don't think of it
as robbery.

35:41.278 --> 35:43.046
Think of it
as sharing at gunpoint.

35:54.725 --> 35:57.627
Come on. Hurry it up, Mike.
You're out of time.

35:57.695 --> 35:59.362
Air support's
heading your way.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.501
Looks like the cops
are headed this way, too.

36:05.936 --> 36:07.737
Now, that didn't hurt too bad,
did it?

36:07.805 --> 36:09.806
You think
you can get away with this?

36:09.874 --> 36:11.574
I think we just did.

36:11.642 --> 36:12.609
Now get the hell
out of here.

36:18.582 --> 36:21.017
Get out of there, Mike.
You're out of time.

36:25.022 --> 36:26.990
<i>One of the nice things</i>
<i>about sending</i>

36:27.057 --> 36:30.093
<i>a full-scale Homeland Security</i>
<i>response after your enemies</i>

36:30.160 --> 36:31.394
<i>is the fact</i>
<i>that you can get the resources</i>

36:31.462 --> 36:33.096
<i>of every branch</i>
<i>of law enforcement,</i>

36:33.163 --> 36:36.332
<i>which means they generally</i>
<i>catch whoever they're after.</i>

36:38.269 --> 36:42.972
<i>And they don't listen</i>
<i>to excuses.</i>

36:43.040 --> 36:45.174
Come on, fellas.
Look, you don't understand.

36:45.242 --> 36:46.442
I was set up.

36:46.510 --> 36:48.278
Get down!
Hands on your head!

36:59.490 --> 37:02.191
Now that you don't need
a fortress to stay hidden,

37:02.259 --> 37:04.060
are you gonna
track down Sherry?

37:04.128 --> 37:06.095
Well,
if she's not too pissed.

37:06.163 --> 37:08.398
Well, I have a feeling
she'll hear you out.

37:08.465 --> 37:11.334
So this is your,
um, uh, smuggler friend?

37:11.402 --> 37:15.171
Yeah, he can get you back down
to Puerto Rico in a few hours,

37:15.239 --> 37:17.440
but don't call him
"smuggler."

37:17.508 --> 37:19.309
Can I just say
one thing?

37:19.376 --> 37:21.511
This virus is not
a good thing.

37:21.579 --> 37:25.148
And whoever you're getting it
for is not a good person.

37:25.215 --> 37:27.417
Yeah, I know.
It's a little complicated.

37:27.484 --> 37:29.419
I remember when I was making it,
I thought I was this, like,

37:29.486 --> 37:31.254
badass outlaw
or something.

37:31.322 --> 37:34.958
And by the time I figured out
I wasn't, it was too late.

37:35.025 --> 37:37.160
So I don't know
who Michael's working for,

37:37.227 --> 37:39.429
but just tell him
to be careful,

37:39.496 --> 37:44.067
'cause some roads you go down,
you can't get back from.

37:44.134 --> 37:45.435
Believe me, he knows.

37:46.770 --> 37:47.837
We both do.

38:10.810 --> 38:13.011
Ma?

38:17.516 --> 38:19.908
I want to thank you
for helping with the police.

38:20.755 --> 38:22.322
I talked to Sam.

38:25.992 --> 38:29.928
You're really handing off
a computer virus to this guy?

38:29.996 --> 38:34.699
Anson has Fi dead to rights.
I don't have a choice.

38:34.767 --> 38:36.534
I <i>have</i> to give him
what he wants.

38:36.602 --> 38:38.770
Yeah? Then what?

38:38.838 --> 38:43.475
Then he disappears,
and I try to move on.

38:43.542 --> 38:45.577
I'll track him down
one day.

38:54.220 --> 38:58.356
What's the latest
with the CIA?

38:58.424 --> 39:02.660
I meet
with Pearce tomorrow.

39:02.728 --> 39:04.921
I get the results back
from my security review.

39:06.225 --> 39:08.827
Sounds like
they're beginning to trust you.

39:10.363 --> 39:13.098
Just when
they shouldn't.

39:14.867 --> 39:16.935
You know,
I don't like any of this,

39:17.003 --> 39:20.906
but for what it's worth,
they should trust you...

39:20.973 --> 39:23.308
Now more than ever.

39:27.146 --> 39:30.315
<i>For a spy,</i>
<i>loyalty is a strange thing.</i>

39:30.383 --> 39:34.486
<i>Your job is to deceive,</i>
<i>to live among your enemies,</i>

39:34.554 --> 39:36.821
<i>to perform dark deeds</i>
<i>for a noble purpose.</i>

39:36.889 --> 39:38.190
<i>And it's that purpose</i>

39:38.257 --> 39:40.458
<i>that guides you through</i>
<i>the darkness.</i>

39:40.526 --> 39:44.863
<i>When you lose sight of that,</i>
<i>the darkness is all there is.</i>

40:00.613 --> 40:02.314
You look like you
could use a nap.

40:02.381 --> 40:04.449
Worried about
the security review?

40:04.517 --> 40:05.984
It crossed my mind.

40:07.587 --> 40:09.154
Any reason
you should be worried?

40:10.389 --> 40:11.756
You tell me.

40:14.327 --> 40:17.596
You got your clearance.
Congrats.

40:17.663 --> 40:19.397
You're still off the books,
but...

40:21.434 --> 40:23.068
It's better
than nothing.

40:23.135 --> 40:25.537
I know we got off
to a bumpy start,

40:25.605 --> 40:29.608
but I'm glad we can be honest
with each other.

40:29.675 --> 40:32.143
Me too.

40:32.211 --> 40:33.945
From now on,
make sure the lies you tell

40:34.013 --> 40:35.480
are the ones
we <i>want</i> you to tl.

40:35.548 --> 40:37.649
Anything
for the Agency.

40:37.717 --> 40:39.097
Good.
They're cooking up some

40:39.098 --> 40:41.133
assignments in D.C.
we'll be in touch soon.

40:45.891 --> 40:47.659
Go.

40:47.727 --> 40:51.263
Celebrate.

40:58.404 --> 41:00.839
You live in a beautiful place,
Michael.

41:00.906 --> 41:03.842
I prefer a climate
without mosquitos.

41:03.909 --> 41:06.778
You know what the secret
of happiness is?

41:06.846 --> 41:09.014
Wanting what you have.

41:09.081 --> 41:10.815
What I have
is a flash drive.

41:10.883 --> 41:14.152
What I want is everything
you have on Fiona.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.422
Well, don't get ahead
of yourself.

41:17.490 --> 41:19.724
The virus does me no good
in your hands.

41:19.792 --> 41:22.093
I need it in
the CIA's computer system.

41:22.161 --> 41:25.230
That shouldn't be too hard with
your new security clearance.

41:26.966 --> 41:28.266
You really expect me --

41:28.334 --> 41:30.769
Michael, listen to me.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.270
I know you.

41:32.338 --> 41:35.073
The martyr complex,
the daddy issues,

41:35.141 --> 41:36.441
the problems
with authority.

41:36.509 --> 41:39.944
I know
that every part of you...

41:40.012 --> 41:42.681
is telling you
to fight this.

41:42.748 --> 41:46.418
But you've got to realize
how smart I am, right?

41:46.485 --> 41:48.219
So ask yourself,

41:48.287 --> 41:50.588
"why would I be willing
to put myself in this position?

41:50.656 --> 41:55.160
Why am I so comfortable telling
you that I own you?"

41:55.227 --> 41:58.430
Because it's true.

41:58.497 --> 42:02.634
There's no moves left
on the chess board.

42:02.702 --> 42:04.769
Unless you're willing
to see

42:04.837 --> 42:07.305
your girlfriend go to prison
for the rest of her life,

42:07.373 --> 42:12.410
you will do exactly
what I say.

42:12.478 --> 42:15.513
I'll be seeing you real soon,
Michael.
