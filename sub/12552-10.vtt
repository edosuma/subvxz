CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road is</i>
<i>where Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.340 --> 00:10.577
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.643 --> 00:14.280
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>

00:29.496 --> 00:30.930
-Ready?
-Always.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.103
Prepare to meet the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:41.241
The <i>Mona Lisa</i> has been stolen!

00:41.307 --> 00:43.042
-This is the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
-But it can't be.

00:44.577 --> 00:45.678
(LAUGHING)

00:45.745 --> 00:46.913
When I act like
a real teenager,

00:46.980 --> 00:48.415
you want me to be
perfect again.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.116
The way the Bane made me!

00:50.183 --> 00:51.918
It's weird enough
for Sarah Jane,
we should call her.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.954
No, we don't need her,
we can do this ourselves.

00:55.021 --> 00:57.190
-(ROAR)
-What is that?

00:57.257 --> 00:59.426
That is my brother.

01:01.127 --> 01:02.095
Sarah Jane!

01:02.529 --> 01:03.696
Mum!

01:03.763 --> 01:07.534
And that is how
she'll stay forever.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.318
What have you done with her?

01:25.385 --> 01:28.388
Do you not like it?
I mean I know
art is subjective.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.824
But I think she looks
as pretty as a picture.

01:30.890 --> 01:34.861
Well, most pictures.
I think we can all agree
I'm in a different league.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.163
-Yeah, too right.
-Mmm, ta.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.265
He didn't mean it
as a compliment!

01:39.332 --> 01:40.934
And you're just jealous.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.469
Get my Mum
out of that painting!

01:42.535 --> 01:44.671
-Now!
-So you can say "Sowwy"?

01:44.737 --> 01:47.340
-What?
-Well, only an hour ago
you didn't need her.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.842
Nothing gets past me, kids.

01:48.908 --> 01:51.544
You were all,

Don't worry, young man.
Your mother is
perfectly safe...

01:58.818 --> 02:00.353
Just like Miss Trupp here.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.622
As soon as Mona Lisa
has found her brother,

02:02.689 --> 02:05.558
she will release them both,
I'm sure.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.862
-Her brother?
-It's... Another painting.

02:08.928 --> 02:09.895

-You mean that?
-CLYDE: Oh, boy,
have we got trouble.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.135
MONA LISA: Too right, sugar.

02:16.202 --> 02:17.937
If you know
what's good for you,
I'd butt out.

02:18.137 --> 02:20.240
I can't do that.
Whatever you're doing,

02:20.306 --> 02:21.941
my Mum was
going to stop you...

02:22.008 --> 02:24.177
And that means
now I have to.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.413
Aw, couldn't you just
eat them, Harders?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.383
They're so sweet
and they think
they can handle me.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.485

-Because we can!

02:38.391 --> 02:39.826
I keep forgetting
I've got legs now.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.562
-My painting!
-My Mum!

she could've done this?

No, I don't understand
any of it.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.781
Well, we'd better
work it out. Fast.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.083
The <i>Mona Lisa</i> has existed
for five centuries.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.752
There must be a reason
she's come to life

03:05.818 --> 03:07.520
and it has to be about
this gallery.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.222
Most likely,
whatever is roaring
it's head off down there

03:09.289 --> 03:11.424

-What was that?
-You heard it, too?

03:18.631 --> 03:20.099
I thought I was just getting
ringing in my ears.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.172
Where did he come from?

03:27.907 --> 03:30.176
William Bonneville's painting,

anything about art?
-I don't.

Shouldn't he be firing

04:00.707 --> 04:02.742
Yeah, well...
Two flintlocks, two shots.
He's out of ammo.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.712
Come on.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.285

They're just children.
They can't do anything

04:31.170 --> 04:33.940
Well, aren't you a sweetie,
Harders? Hmm?

04:34.007 --> 04:36.943
All worried about
the little kiddie-winkies.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.579
But they're children.
You must have had children!

04:39.646 --> 04:43.282
Children?
Have you seen how small
that frame of mine was?

04:43.349 --> 04:44.884
Not much room
for a family in there!

04:44.951 --> 04:47.754
I meant before. The real Lisa.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.390
Now look here, Harders...

04:50.456 --> 04:52.392
Let's get this straight.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.395
I am the Mona Lisa <i> .</i>

04:55.461 --> 04:58.364
Not that dreary

She laughed like a camel
and farted like a donkey.

everyone bangs on about?

05:05.338 --> 05:06.873

05:06.939 --> 05:09.776
So you get your head
around this, Harders,

05:09.842 --> 05:11.911
because I won't say it again.

05:13.046 --> 05:17.116
I am the painting

05:17.183 --> 05:20.720
The most beautiful painting

05:42.542 --> 05:44.744
What kind of art is that?

05:46.546 --> 05:49.082
That's not art.
That's a window.

05:49.148 --> 05:52.151
That's the real world.

What's it like...

05:54.253 --> 05:56.022
Outside.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.191
Well, it's roomier
than in here.

05:58.257 --> 06:00.860
And some of it has grass on.

This is such a cheat!

06:50.743 --> 06:53.379
We could make a home

06:53.446 --> 06:55.648
Well, this wing
is being refurbished.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.884
It could be yours.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.820
A suite, a whole floor...

07:02.421 --> 07:04.190

07:24.510 --> 07:27.146
Of course. I see.

07:27.213 --> 07:31.217
Once we are united,
we will both be free

You'll get a chance

MONA LISA: He has spoken.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.593
Now I know who my brother is.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.562
He is a work so terrible...

08:16.629 --> 08:20.499

Another painting
in the gallery with some sort
of connection to her.

09:00.773 --> 09:04.143
Could that be
why she's come to life?
The two of them so close.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.245
It's the logical explanation.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.848
Perhaps if we find it
before she does,
we can stop her.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.151
There has to be something
in those books to help.

09:14.186 --> 09:18.925
And now he calls to me
from the vaults below.

09:19.125 --> 09:22.962
Oh! And now look
what we have to bring him.

09:23.029 --> 09:27.066
After five centuries,
he might just feel
a little bit peckish.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.270
What is that thing?

09:31.337 --> 09:34.640
-Tell him, Harders.
-A painting
that shouldn't exist.

09:36.175 --> 09:37.510
And now it's time
for a viewing.

09:39.578 --> 09:40.880
Bring him!

09:43.683 --> 09:45.618
There's nothing.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.421
No clue to any painting
linked to the <i>Mona Lisa</i>
or Leonardo.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.723
What about a painting
that isn't supposed to exist?

09:51.590 --> 09:53.459
-What?
-A legend.

09:53.526 --> 09:57.897
A painting too terrifying
to be exhibited,
even to look at.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.166
The <i>Abomination.</i>

10:07.606 --> 10:11.143
The story says that
it was painted by
Giuseppe Di Cattivo,

10:11.210 --> 10:15.481
known in 15th Century Florence
as the Artist of Nightmares.

10:15.548 --> 10:19.185
So he didn't paint
fluffy lambs and
bunny rabbits, then?

10:19.251 --> 10:22.588
Even at the time,
his paintings were
considered disturbing,

10:22.655 --> 10:25.257
an affront to creation.

10:25.324 --> 10:29.495
The <i>Abomination</i> was said
to have been his masterpiece.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.598
RANI: "But when Giuseppe
saw what he had painted,
a terror gripped him.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.035
"He realised that no one
could look on his creation
without losing their sanity.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.237
"And he locked the painting
in a special case,

10:38.304 --> 10:40.473
"made with wood
from a hangman's gallows

10:40.539 --> 10:44.176
"to keep the <i>Abomination</i>
from human eyes
for all eternity."

10:44.243 --> 10:48.581
HARDINGS: He secured the case
with a complex
Chinese puzzle-lock.

10:48.647 --> 10:53.652
The next morning, he was found
in his Florence apartments
beside the wooden case.

10:54.687 --> 10:58.124
He had gone completely insane.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.694
"The secret of the puzzle
was lost to his ravaged mind,

11:01.761 --> 11:03.796
"and the painting
has never been unlocked."

11:08.901 --> 11:10.603
Except it's not
just a story...

11:11.937 --> 11:13.205
Is it?

11:13.272 --> 11:15.875
We're about to find out.

11:15.941 --> 11:20.146
The gallery took possession
of a collection of Giuseppe's
works in Victorian times.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.816
This is the door
to the vaults.

11:23.883 --> 11:27.053
You don't really think
this is going to work out
happily ever after, do you?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.657
Ever since man first drew
on cave walls,

11:31.724 --> 11:33.859
all any artist
ever wanted to do

11:33.926 --> 11:38.264
was breathe life
into what they created.

11:38.330 --> 11:42.268
Can't you appreciate

11:42.334 --> 11:44.904
Can't you appreciate

All right, Harders, ahem...

12:18.304 --> 12:19.538
You first.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.779
LUKE: <i>Giuseppe Di Cattivo.</i>

12:26.846 --> 12:29.682
-Why does that name
mean something?
-I don't know.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.484
I do know one thing.

12:31.550 --> 12:35.054
He was in Florence.
And that's where Leonardo
painted the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

12:35.121 --> 12:36.956
Plus, earlier she said
something about

12:37.022 --> 12:40.693
Leonardo using paint
from his "weirdo neighbour".

12:40.759 --> 12:43.629
That's it!
That's where I've seen
the name before! Come on!

12:58.110 --> 13:01.080
Leonardo da Vinci
and Giuseppe di Cattivo
were both in Florence...

13:01.147 --> 13:02.915
And must have used
the same paint
for both pictures.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.084
That still doesn't explain
how both of them
are coming to life.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.153
Paint is a mineral pigment
held in oil.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.388
What if the minerals
came from a rock
that fell from space?

13:09.455 --> 13:12.324
-A meteorite?
-Like the one that created
Odd Bob the clown.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.026
An energy that survived
on emotion.

13:14.093 --> 13:17.263
For five centuries they were
apart and inactive. Dormant.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.098
But bringing them together
has brought them to life.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.734
Clyde said it sounded
like a caged bear
and that's exactly what it is.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.402
And we think
the <i>Mona Lisa</i> is bad news.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.704
Look! Clyde's bag.

13:32.211 --> 13:34.613
Don't worry.
We can stop this.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.554
I've never been as far inside
the old vaults before.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.391
-It's filthy.
-Oh! You don't say.

13:45.457 --> 13:49.662
But the stories say
the <i>Abomination</i>
is down here somewhere.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.930
Well, I don't see my brother!

13:52.264 --> 13:54.867
If you're playing
games with me, Harders,

13:54.934 --> 13:57.436
I'll feed you to him
as well, feet first!

13:57.503 --> 13:59.205
(ROARING)

13:59.271 --> 14:02.141
-I think
that's your brother calling.
-(ROARING)

14:03.342 --> 14:04.610
Move it!

14:09.582 --> 14:13.319
Well, once she's unlocked
her brother,
she'll be finished with you.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.155
Helping her isn't
going to make
any difference.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.792
Believe me, we're both going
to get abominated.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.628
I know. But what can I do now?

14:27.566 --> 14:28.601
(ROARING)

14:51.190 --> 14:54.026
If you ask me, he doesn't seem
all that pleased to see you.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.929
Show some respect for
my brother in living paint.

14:57.129 --> 15:01.066
'Cause once he's out of there,
then you'll see
some fireworks!

15:03.802 --> 15:05.337
Lisa, you can't do this!

15:05.404 --> 15:08.574
-He's right, you can't.
-What's this, Harders?

15:08.641 --> 15:11.176
Remember where you've left
your backbone all of a sudden?

15:11.243 --> 15:12.978
No.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.880
The puzzle-lock is missing.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.219
Where is it?

15:20.286 --> 15:23.589
Giuseppe's
Chinese puzzle-lock.
I knew I'd seen it.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.591
Like I said,
I remember everything I see.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.793
I don't really get art.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.863
Whoa, it's an art gallery.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.699
But I knew this was
something else. Not art.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.735
-Part of a complex
locking mechanism.
-Part?

15:36.802 --> 15:39.138
This is the key
to the <i>Abomination.</i>

15:39.204 --> 15:41.073
Somehow, it was separated
from the painting

15:41.140 --> 15:43.942
and catalogued by the gallery
as just another work of art.

15:44.009 --> 15:47.413
No one ever realised
what it really was.

15:47.479 --> 15:50.382
But if Mona Lisa wants
to free the Abomination
she's going to need this.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.951
And we can use that
to force her to release Mum.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.788
-You're going to
bargain with her?
-It's a nice idea, kid.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.923
But I don't do deals.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.591
Not while I'm packing heat.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.160
Go fetch.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.965
If you fire that
blaster at us,

16:07.032 --> 16:08.300
you'll destroy
the puzzle-lock.

16:08.367 --> 16:09.868
Well, that's why
I'm not going to fire it then.

16:09.935 --> 16:13.005
Unless you do
something stupid like
smash the puzzle.

16:13.072 --> 16:14.673
Which you won't.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.076
Because I've got
your friend, Clydey.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.311
Where is he?
What have you done to him?

16:19.378 --> 16:21.680
Don't worry. He's all right.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.817
But you'd better
give me the puzzle-lock.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.019
(LAUGHING)

16:35.761 --> 16:38.897
Now, it's me
you're bargaining with.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.835
-What?
-I've been a fool.

16:42.901 --> 16:45.037
Well, I could've told you that
any day. (CHUCKLES)

16:45.104 --> 16:49.108
-Now give me the puzzle.
-I thought you were wonderful.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.310
I dedicated
my professional life,

16:51.377 --> 16:54.713
no, my life to bringing you
to this gallery.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.049
I know, I know,
you're my number one fan.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.185
Now give me the puzzle-lock.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.593
Not until you have
released Miss Trupp,

17:07.659 --> 17:09.694
and this young man's mother.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.500
Oh, you can threaten me
with your ray gun,
it makes no difference.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.335
I'm responsible for this mess.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.137
It's time I took a stand.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.038
(LAUGHING)

17:20.105 --> 17:21.940
You won't. You wouldn't dare.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.643
(FIRES GUN)

17:24.710 --> 17:27.679
All these pretty pictures
are too precious to you...

17:27.746 --> 17:30.182
All that history,
all the colours...

17:33.485 --> 17:35.020
No!

17:36.522 --> 17:37.790
(ROARING)

17:43.061 --> 17:46.832
Oh, you're so gonna wish
you hadn't done that.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.634
Well, for about
a second, anyway!

17:48.700 --> 17:50.669
No! Don't!

17:50.736 --> 17:54.039
There's another way
to release the Abomination.
I can help you!

17:54.106 --> 17:55.707
(SMIRKS) You?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.576
Luke?

17:57.643 --> 17:58.911
But first, you have
to take me to Clyde.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.883
So, did you know
Dick Turpin, then?

18:08.287 --> 18:09.955
You don't say a lot, do you?

18:10.989 --> 18:12.791
Of course, you can't talk.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.093
You only got painted
with that mask.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.296
You don't have a mouth.

18:17.362 --> 18:21.233
Uh! A highwayman
that can't say
"Stand and deliver".

18:21.300 --> 18:23.502
Not going to be much
of a highwayman, really,
are you?

18:25.704 --> 18:26.872
Clyde!

18:26.939 --> 18:29.541
Guys! I knew you'd show up.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.110
Trouble is I've still got
Silent Bob here.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.111
(ROARING)

18:34.613 --> 18:36.548
Oh, and him.

18:36.615 --> 18:40.319
Oh, eh-oh.
I do love a good reunion, me.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.021
Now whatever it is
you're going to do,
you get on with it.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.189
(CHAINS RATTLING)

18:46.492 --> 18:49.361
(TUTTING) My brother's
becoming restless.

18:49.428 --> 18:53.098
-What's going on?
-Luke's got a plan.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.701
-You're going to release
the Abomination.
-I'm what?

18:55.767 --> 18:58.403
Mr Harding destroyed
the puzzle lock.
You can draw a new one.

18:58.937 --> 18:59.905
I can?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.675
Okay. I can. But why would I?

19:03.742 --> 19:06.912
Mona Lisa will make
the picture real and use it
to unlock the Abomination.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.480
Which will then
rampage across Earth.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.084
Everyone that sees it
will go mad or die.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.219
-Probably both.
-I want Mum back.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.022
You can't trust her.
Even I realise that now.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.692
-He's right, mate.
-You know, Clydey,
this Sultana blaster.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.027
I think you mean Sontaran.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.196
Whatever!

19:24.263 --> 19:26.698
It hasn't seen much use.
That could easily change.

19:26.765 --> 19:29.868
Do it, Clyde.
She can't use the photograph
to bring it back to life.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.503
She has to use something
that's been drawn,

19:31.570 --> 19:33.872
something that's
been invested with
human energy!

19:33.939 --> 19:35.641
Luke, are you sure about this?

19:35.707 --> 19:38.143
I know you're upset
about Sarah Jane
but this seems wrong.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.913
Sarah Jane wouldn't
want us doing this.
It's not her way.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.348
You're right, Clyde.
I'm not doing this Mum's way.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.516
This is my way.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.884
Draw it. Please.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.488
Just do it.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.224
That's the way, Clydey.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.060
Now you make this
your best work, in fact,

19:56.528 --> 19:57.930
you make it a masterpiece.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.133
I can't believe
you're doing this.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.000
Just trust me.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.136
(ROARS)

20:04.202 --> 20:05.904
My brother in living paint!

20:07.072 --> 20:09.374
Your wait will soon be over,

20:09.441 --> 20:12.778
and then your reign of
fire and sulphur shall begin.

20:12.844 --> 20:17.282
And the world will be
a rage of flames at our feet.

20:17.349 --> 20:19.718
You have to
stop this, Mona Lisa.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.988
I thought you wanted
to experience the world,
not destroy it.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.923
What use is that to me?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.960
A world of flowers and trees,

20:28.026 --> 20:33.165
or ablaze with fire and
torrents of molten lava?

20:33.231 --> 20:35.534
(LAUGHS)

20:35.601 --> 20:38.036
That's it!
You mustn't do this, Clyde.
I'm tearing it up!

20:38.103 --> 20:39.304
No!

20:39.371 --> 20:41.907
It's finished. I'm sorry.

20:43.642 --> 20:47.546
And now it is time
to release my brother!

20:48.380 --> 20:49.147
Give it to me.

20:52.851 --> 20:57.856
Ooh, that's not bad, Clydey,
that's not bad at all.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.627
I hope you know
what you're doing, my padawan.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.895
You've gone right over
to the dark side.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.269
I have it!

21:11.336 --> 21:12.904
I really hope you know
what you're doing!

21:29.121 --> 21:30.589
Here, my brother.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.025
Your deliverance!

21:40.499 --> 21:41.733
You are free!

21:42.367 --> 21:43.669
(ROARING)

21:45.771 --> 21:47.072
(SCREAMING)

21:54.212 --> 21:56.481
-It's coming out!
-Don't look at it!

21:56.548 --> 21:58.183
My brother!

22:04.990 --> 22:06.958
LUKE: K9! Now!
MONA LISA: What is that?

22:07.025 --> 22:09.628
-Where did you come from?
-Who let that
metal mutt in here?

22:09.695 --> 22:10.896
Don't mess with my dog, Lisa!

22:15.500 --> 22:16.702
No!

22:23.008 --> 22:26.445
No, my brother!
Don't abandon me. No!

22:27.779 --> 22:30.182
Maximum pigmentation
dispersal.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.950
I'm not having this!

22:32.017 --> 22:32.884
K9, look out!

22:35.721 --> 22:37.355
What's happening?

22:37.422 --> 22:38.990
You...shoot 'em!

22:45.530 --> 22:47.532
(SCREAMING) No!

22:47.599 --> 22:49.401
Everything it did
is being reversed.

22:49.468 --> 22:52.938
-Oh, good work, K9!
-Thank you, Mistress Rani.

22:53.004 --> 22:55.340
I can't go back
into that frame!

22:55.407 --> 22:57.442
-I won't!
-You've got no choice.

22:57.509 --> 22:58.944
-(CRUMBLING)
-Please!

22:59.010 --> 23:01.179
That room
that you promised me.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.882
A living work of art,
that's what you said.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.485
I'll do it!

23:06.551 --> 23:07.919
I'll do anything...

23:07.986 --> 23:11.623
If you let me stay here
and you let me live.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.226
CLYDE: He can't
help you, Lisa.
No one can.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.595
You're going back to the way
Leonardo created you.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.563
Paint and board.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.832
But I've always
been able to think...

23:20.899 --> 23:23.301
-And to feel...
-And you still will.

23:23.368 --> 23:26.138
-Just back in your painting.
-Where you belong.

23:26.204 --> 23:29.007
I want to be flesh.

23:30.575 --> 23:31.910
No!

23:39.785 --> 23:40.786
No!

23:50.262 --> 23:53.498
And that's the last of her,
I hope.

23:53.565 --> 23:56.101
With the
Abomination destroyed,
she's never coming back.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.537
K9, my man.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.907
He was just a drawing too?

24:03.241 --> 24:05.377
From my sketchbook.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.412
It was the picture underneath.

24:07.479 --> 24:11.483
Luke wanted me to draw it
so when Lisa brought the lock
into existence,

24:11.550 --> 24:13.351
she brought K9 to life, too.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.153
You mean you knew
what he was up to?

24:15.220 --> 24:16.655
(SMIRKS) Of course I didn't.

24:17.355 --> 24:18.657
But I trusted him.

24:20.592 --> 24:21.726
My man!

24:23.495 --> 24:25.063
Come on,
we've got to find Mum.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.672
<i>Mia bella.</i>

24:35.807 --> 24:37.442
(GASPS) Miss Trupp!

24:43.381 --> 24:44.482
Mum!

24:44.549 --> 24:45.584
Oh, Luke!

24:50.021 --> 24:51.022
You're safe!

24:58.864 --> 24:59.898
CLYDE: Where's he going?

25:10.976 --> 25:12.944
Oh, Miss Trupp!

25:15.180 --> 25:17.282
Phyllis!

25:17.349 --> 25:20.485
I've... I've had the most
bizarre dream.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.320
So have I.

25:22.387 --> 25:27.158
The most bizarre,
frightening dream
for 25 years.

25:27.225 --> 25:30.695
When true happiness
was right there under my nose.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.698
Call me Lionel.

25:33.765 --> 25:36.034
Lionel?

25:36.101 --> 25:39.271
-Call you Lionel?
-It's my name, Miss Trupp.

25:39.337 --> 25:40.572
I mean, Phyllis.

25:41.239 --> 25:42.908
My first name.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.144
I know it's your name...

25:47.579 --> 25:49.014
"Harders".

25:49.981 --> 25:51.850
Mona Lisa dumped you, did she?

25:53.251 --> 25:54.953
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.022
Oh, I heard you. <i>"Mia bella!"</i>

25:58.456 --> 25:59.925
That...

25:59.991 --> 26:02.661
Trollop imprisoned me.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.363
And you were all over her!

26:05.430 --> 26:07.165
You... You...

26:07.232 --> 26:08.600
Art tart!

26:10.468 --> 26:12.237
Phyllis!

26:12.304 --> 26:15.040
-Wait...please!
-CLYDE: Uh-oh!

26:15.106 --> 26:18.410
Looks like
you've painted yourself into
a corner there, Harders.

26:22.681 --> 26:26.518
A living consciousness
imprisoned like that.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.054
-I almost feel sorry for her.
-Almost?

26:29.120 --> 26:32.590
Well, you can go off
someone when
they trap you in a picture.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.392
But I knew you three
would always be there for me.

26:34.459 --> 26:35.794
I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.595
Well, it was all down
to Luke, really.

26:37.662 --> 26:40.298
I know.
And I am so proud of you.

26:40.365 --> 26:44.869
My wonderful, clever,
resourceful, dependable son.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.905
-And messy?
-Oh, yes, that as well.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.774
But then nobody's perfect.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.910
Yeah, look at Mona Lisa.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.548
And I'll sort out my room
when we get home. I promise.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.516
And while you're doing that,

26:58.583 --> 27:01.886
Clyde and I
will be having a little chat
about Sontaran blasters.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.456
(LAUGHING)

27:09.060 --> 27:10.862
Slitheen! They're back.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.864
(SCREECHES)

27:12.931 --> 27:14.132
SARAH JANE:
<i>Slitheen back on Earth,</i>
<i>it means mayhem.</i>

27:14.199 --> 27:16.835
Switch it off, boys!
I won't ask you again.

27:16.901 --> 27:19.204
-No chance!
-Stand back, Miss Smith!

27:19.270 --> 27:22.774
-But who are you?
-We are Blathereen.

27:22.841 --> 27:26.544
This little plant
could save millions of lives.

27:26.611 --> 27:28.913
Do you really think we can
trust the Blathereen?

27:28.980 --> 27:30.882
-(GRUNTS)
-Let her go! No!
