00:22.734 --> 00:25.200

01:30.234 --> 01:32.100
Kelly, are you going out

01:32.100 --> 01:35.267
walking by
construction sites again?

01:35.267 --> 01:36.868
Because if you are,
give me five minutes.

01:36.868 --> 01:39.534
I'll put on something cute
and come join you.

01:39.534 --> 01:42.033
No, Mom, this is my
Valentine's Day outfit.

01:42.033 --> 01:45.067
See, all the guys
are down at the mall,

01:45.067 --> 01:46.100
you know, waiting for me

01:46.100 --> 01:47.501
to give me their cards
and candy

01:47.501 --> 01:48.701
and other gifts
of their devotion,

01:48.701 --> 01:50.200
so I'll be taking
the laundry bag.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.434
You don't need it, do you?

01:51.434 --> 01:53.701
Nah. It's mostly decorative.

01:53.701 --> 01:57.767
Gee, I sure hope Bud gets
a Valentine this year.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.267
So does he.

01:59.267 --> 02:01.067
He's got about
as much chance

02:01.067 --> 02:02.734
of getting a Valentine

02:02.734 --> 02:05.868
as I do
of getting an "A."

02:10.400 --> 02:13.868
Ladies...Kelly.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.901
Yup, this is going
to be my special day.

02:25.901 --> 02:27.400
Any girls call me?

02:27.400 --> 02:29.901
Yup. They call you
Geek, Dork,

02:29.901 --> 02:31.934
and Hairy Palms.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.100
That was the old Bud.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.567
This year, I'm hot.

02:35.567 --> 02:37.868
See, in the past, I haven't
been interested in girls.

02:37.868 --> 02:42.234
Seeing Kelly in the morning
can do that to a guy.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.033
No, but this year,
I threw around a few winks,

02:47.033 --> 02:49.868
let it be known
I'm accepting Valentines,

02:49.868 --> 02:51.868
so they should be rolling in.

02:51.868 --> 02:53.367
Won't they, Mom?

02:53.367 --> 02:56.367
Sure, they will, son.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.901
But not for you.

02:57.901 --> 03:01.300
Well, I'm
off to the mall.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.868
Hey, Kel,
I see you're wearing

03:02.868 --> 03:04.467
your "love me for my mind"
outfit again.

03:08.501 --> 03:11.000
I hate Valentine's Day
in the shoe store.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.501
Every fat woman
in Chicago hippos in

03:13.501 --> 03:17.167
wanting pink pumps.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.834
They think it
makes them look sexy,

03:18.834 --> 03:20.534
as if anyone
could see the shoes

03:20.534 --> 03:23.200
over the bulging flesh
of their ankles.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.834
Good morning, Al.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:31.267 --> 03:33.000
So, honey, you want
anything special

03:33.000 --> 03:34.667
for Valentine's Day?

03:34.667 --> 03:37.634
Yeah, but she's
wrestling in the mud,

03:37.634 --> 03:39.133
and I'm just living there.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.634
[DOORBELL RINGS]

03:40.634 --> 03:42.133
Who the hell could that be?

03:42.133 --> 03:44.467
Well, it's Valentine's Day.
Maybe it's Cupid.

03:44.467 --> 03:46.968
No, he'd never
show his face around here again

03:46.968 --> 03:48.734
after making this match.

03:48.734 --> 03:50.634
Hi, Al.

03:50.634 --> 03:53.968
You know, all you have to do
is walk outside, look around.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.601
You just know
it's Valentine's Day.

03:55.601 --> 03:56.767
What do you want?

03:56.767 --> 03:57.868
Al, I need a favor.

03:59.367 --> 04:01.300
Uh, Peggy, I need a favor.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.701
I need someplace
to hide Marcie's present.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.300
Oh, gee, Steve, what is it?

04:06.300 --> 04:08.300
You know, having Al
for a husband,

04:08.300 --> 04:10.801
I've always wondered,
what do husbands

04:10.801 --> 04:14.000
give their wives
for Valentine's Day?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.466
Well, this isn't
a fair example.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.834
See, for us, it's not just
Valentine's Day.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.601
It's our first anniversary.

04:20.601 --> 04:23.334
Oh, Al...

04:23.334 --> 04:27.300
Leave me alone.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.100
Yes, well, uh,
would you hide this for me?

04:30.100 --> 04:34.667
Sure. I'll
hide it upstairs.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.434
Let me save you
some wear and tear

04:37.434 --> 04:39.367
on your nails
and teeth.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.267
See, the first anniversary
is paper,

04:41.267 --> 04:43.267
and since paper
isn't all that romantic,

04:43.267 --> 04:45.634
I got her tickets for two
to Hawaii.

04:45.634 --> 04:48.234
Oh, now, please don't tell her.
I want it to be a surprise.

04:48.234 --> 04:51.133
Don't worry.
I can keep a secret.

04:51.133 --> 04:53.133
Oh, by the way, Al,

04:53.133 --> 04:55.968
that little rubber doughnut
you ordered came in yesterday.

04:55.968 --> 04:57.667
Al's got 'rhoids,
you know.

05:01.968 --> 05:07.467
Well, you're obviously
sitting pretty.

05:07.467 --> 05:09.434
So, what are you
getting Peggy

05:09.434 --> 05:11.000
for Valentine's Day?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.968
Fur, jewels, a car?

05:12.968 --> 05:15.968
If it was
only that easy.

05:15.968 --> 05:19.667
I'm going to have
sex with her.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.667
It's kind of a tradition.

05:21.667 --> 05:24.667
Every Valentine's Day,
I climb those stairs,

05:24.667 --> 05:27.334
you know, walk
the last mile, and, uh...

05:27.334 --> 05:32.267
slam-dunk her one.

05:32.267 --> 05:33.667
It's a spin
through hell for me,

05:33.667 --> 05:35.501
but she
seems to like it.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.767
I only pray
that after 16 years,

05:37.767 --> 05:39.000
Marcie and I will
have

05:39.000 --> 05:42.100
that kind of magic
between us.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.834
Steve, if it was magic,

05:43.834 --> 05:46.100
I could do it from down
here in front of the TV.

05:58.801 --> 06:00.834
[DOORBELL RINGS]

06:00.834 --> 06:02.133
Hi, Peggy.

06:02.133 --> 06:04.133
I waited till Steve left home.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.634
I need your help.

06:05.634 --> 06:08.434
What can I get him
for our anniversary?

06:08.434 --> 06:12.634
Well, don't get him
two tickets to Hawaii.

06:12.634 --> 06:16.734
That's what he got you.
It's a surprise.

06:16.734 --> 06:20.634
He got me tickets to Hawaii?

06:20.634 --> 06:22.133
Damn him!

06:22.133 --> 06:25.667
He's so irritating,
getting me the perfect gift.

06:25.667 --> 06:29.167
Now I have to get him
something just as great.

06:29.167 --> 06:31.901
What a weenie.
God, I hate him.

06:31.901 --> 06:35.133
Sure you do.
He's your husband.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.267
Yeah, well,

06:36.267 --> 06:38.601
I still have to find him
something really good--

06:38.601 --> 06:41.934
something personal,
something romantic,

06:41.934 --> 06:43.434
something that symbolizes

06:43.434 --> 06:46.367
the depth and purity
of our relationship.

06:46.367 --> 06:49.467
You could jump naked
out of a cake.

06:49.467 --> 06:51.534
Yeah. That says it all!

06:51.534 --> 06:52.934
But who would know

06:52.934 --> 06:55.400
where to find something
so kinky?

06:55.400 --> 06:59.300
Cakes a Poppin'.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.300
Just ask for Leif.
Here's their number.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.300
Oh, and when you pay,
have them stamp my card.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.801
Two more, I get one free.

07:07.801 --> 07:09.300
I'll do it.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.801
I know.
The cake can say,

07:11.801 --> 07:13.667
"Take me.
I'm yours."

07:13.667 --> 07:15.133
Steve will love it.
Thanks, Peg.

07:15.133 --> 07:18.400
So, do you know
what Al's getting you?

07:18.400 --> 07:21.300
Oh, yeah. Same thing he
gets me every year.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.067
He's going to slam-dunk
me a quick one.

07:27.901 --> 07:29.300
Of course,
those are his words.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.300
I mean, in reality,

07:30.300 --> 07:34.834
it's more like
a foul shot.

07:34.834 --> 07:39.501
You know, he takes
a deep breath and scores.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.667
Sure, it's worth a point,

07:40.667 --> 07:43.968
but it will never make
the highlight reel.

07:43.968 --> 07:48.200
It's like your honeymoon
never ended.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.200
But as long as he
tells you he loves you,

07:50.200 --> 07:51.767
I guess that's all
that really matters.

07:51.767 --> 07:53.501
Actually, Al says,

07:53.501 --> 07:57.601
"There. That
should hold you."

07:57.601 --> 07:59.100
But you know Al.
You know,

07:59.100 --> 08:01.601
he just has difficulty
saying certain things,

08:01.601 --> 08:04.133
Like "I love you,"
"thank you,"

08:04.133 --> 08:07.334
and "Look out.
There's a car coming."

08:07.334 --> 08:10.801
Oh, bunk.
You live in this hovel,

08:10.801 --> 08:13.801
you bore him
those two awful children,

08:13.801 --> 08:16.701
and he can't even
tell you he loves you?

08:16.701 --> 08:18.300
I've heard him say
"I love the Cubs."

08:18.300 --> 08:19.300
"I'd love a beer."

08:19.300 --> 08:21.834
"I'd love it
if you leave, Marcie."

08:21.834 --> 08:22.868
Face it, Peggy.

08:22.868 --> 08:25.100
This man's no stranger
to the word "love."

08:25.100 --> 08:28.567
Oh, it doesn't matter.
I mean, I know he loves me.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.067
He doesn't say it,

08:30.067 --> 08:33.067
and it would be nice
to hear it once in a while,

08:33.067 --> 08:34.567
but it's no big deal.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.967
I mean, he does so many other
wonderful things for me.

08:36.967 --> 08:40.534
He, uh...

08:42.100 --> 08:43.701
Hi, Mom.

08:43.701 --> 08:46.868
Kelly, what does
your father do for me?

08:46.868 --> 08:51.267
Well, he...

08:51.267 --> 08:53.000
Daddy?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.100
Nevermind.

08:54.100 --> 08:55.601
Where's your brother?

08:55.601 --> 08:57.133
Oh, he's standing
by the mailbox,

08:57.133 --> 08:58.601
waiting for a valentine.

08:58.601 --> 09:00.100
I haven't got the heart

09:00.100 --> 09:02.100
to remind him
it's Sunday.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.634
Well, just in case he doesn't
get one this year,

09:04.634 --> 09:06.868
I want you to
go easy on him, okay?

09:06.868 --> 09:08.267
Come on, Mom.
We both know

09:08.267 --> 09:10.100
that Bud's an obnoxious,
ratlike creature,

09:10.100 --> 09:13.133
but it doesn't mean
I don't love him.

09:13.133 --> 09:14.267
He knows that.

09:14.267 --> 09:15.801
How does he know that?

09:15.801 --> 09:16.734
I tell him.

09:17.868 --> 09:20.167
Well, has
he ever told you?

09:20.167 --> 09:21.367
Oh, sure. You got to.

09:21.367 --> 09:22.968
I mean, it kind of
takes the edge

09:22.968 --> 09:24.734
off things like this...

09:30.133 --> 09:32.467
Oh, Bud. It's Sunday.

09:32.467 --> 09:35.634
There's no mail
on Sunday.

09:35.634 --> 09:37.968
Happy Valentine's Day.

09:37.968 --> 09:42.300
No!

09:42.300 --> 09:45.968
Love him? You betcha.

09:45.968 --> 09:48.501
Hey, Peg. How come when I said,
"Hi, Bud,"

09:48.501 --> 09:50.701
he said,
"I don't need your pity"?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.534
You don't really want to know,
do you?

09:54.534 --> 09:57.968
Nope.

09:57.968 --> 10:03.133
What time is dinner
rearing its ugly head?

10:03.133 --> 10:04.968
Soon, honey.

10:04.968 --> 10:08.133
By the way...
I love you, Al.

10:08.133 --> 10:11.434
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:11.434 --> 10:13.968
Look, Peg, I know you're
anxiously awaiting

10:13.968 --> 10:17.400
your Valentine
sex-a-rama...

10:17.400 --> 10:19.033
So here's the plan.

10:19.033 --> 10:20.734
I can slide you in

10:20.734 --> 10:21.734
between the Bulls-
Pistons game

10:21.734 --> 10:24.467
and <i>The Rifleman.</i>

10:24.467 --> 10:27.067
Gee, there's about
four or five commercials

10:27.067 --> 10:28.534
in between them.

10:28.534 --> 10:31.300
Are we going
to do it twice?

10:31.300 --> 10:32.567
Peg, remember,

10:32.567 --> 10:36.701
a smart mouth
is a lonely mouth.

10:36.701 --> 10:38.567
You know, Al, this year,

10:38.567 --> 10:40.901
I was hoping
for something different.

10:40.901 --> 10:47.400
Uh-uh, Peg.
The socks stay on.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.400
No, Al. This year,
instead of sex,

10:50.400 --> 10:52.100
I want you
to tell me you love me.

10:57.701 --> 11:01.334
What if I do
take the socks off?

11:01.334 --> 11:02.801
I'm serious, Al.
I want to hear it.

11:02.801 --> 11:03.801
Yeah, right.

11:03.801 --> 11:05.000
Well, listen, Peg.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.467
I'm going to go
upstairs and wash up,

11:06.467 --> 11:08.000
but just to show you

11:08.000 --> 11:10.200
how really special
you are to me,

11:10.200 --> 11:14.133
tonight I'm
going to kiss you.

11:17.567 --> 11:22.033
Well, Mom, I've got all my cards
in this bag.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.901
Now, instead of dating
all the guys in here,

11:24.901 --> 11:27.267
which last year proved
to be almost impossible,

11:27.267 --> 11:29.100
this year, I'm going to
pick one lucky guy

11:29.100 --> 11:30.634
to represent
all of my admirers.

11:30.634 --> 11:31.701
Doesn't matter who it is.

11:31.701 --> 11:33.033
This is the one day

11:33.033 --> 11:34.033
everyone
has a fair chance,

11:34.033 --> 11:38.167
so pick one for me.

11:38.167 --> 11:39.167
Josh.

11:39.167 --> 11:44.601
He's really ugly.
Pick again.

11:44.601 --> 11:46.467
Sheldon?

11:46.467 --> 11:50.834
Okay, give me the bag.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.133
Okay.

11:53.133 --> 11:57.033
Pick the red one
with the star.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.400
Johnny.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.434
Oh, what luck.
The cutest guy in school.

12:00.434 --> 12:02.968
Oh, you sure know
how to pick a man.

12:06.467 --> 12:09.567
Well, all my Valentines
finally came in.

12:09.567 --> 12:10.968
I'm going upstairs
to open them.

[BOTTLES CLANKING]

12:13.467 --> 12:15.968
Sounds kind of
like pop bottles.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.367
Well, they're not.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.868
They're paper.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.033
[CLANK]

12:20.033 --> 12:21.534
Uh, you know, Bud...

12:21.534 --> 12:23.501
You're my Valentine.

12:23.501 --> 12:28.734
Wow. Wait till I
go tell the guys.

12:28.734 --> 12:30.868
Well, speaking
of losers,

12:30.868 --> 12:33.334
I'm going to go through 
these excess Valentines.

12:33.334 --> 12:36.834
Let's see. "Fairest Kelly."

12:36.834 --> 12:41.667
"Beautiful Kelly."
"Kelly, my love. "

12:41.667 --> 12:43.167
"Dearest Bud"?

12:43.167 --> 12:45.167
Yes, yes! I knew it!

12:45.167 --> 12:47.901
Give it here.

12:52.167 --> 12:57.834
It's from some girl
named...April May June.

12:57.834 --> 13:00.334
She says she loves me,

13:00.334 --> 13:02.834
and she's coming over
to see me tonight.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.501
Oh, that's great, honey.

13:04.501 --> 13:07.334
Did you write
that card as a joke?

13:07.334 --> 13:09.067
No. Did you?

13:09.067 --> 13:12.033
Hey, you did write this,
didn't you, Kel?

13:12.033 --> 13:13.534
I mean, "April,
May, June"--

13:13.534 --> 13:19.467
those are all
words you know.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.667
Come on, Kel, just tell me,
because I've got a chance

13:21.667 --> 13:23.400
to go to the Bulls game
tonight with Joey.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.467
Gee, Bud. Dilemma, dilemma.

13:25.467 --> 13:27.467
Do you get all dressed up,

13:27.467 --> 13:29.701
stay here,
and look like an idiot,

13:29.701 --> 13:30.834
or go to the game,

13:30.834 --> 13:32.801
stand up the only date
you'll ever have,

13:32.801 --> 13:33.934
and look like an idiot?

13:33.934 --> 13:36.367
Hmm. Tough one for Bud.

13:36.367 --> 13:37.667
Well, I'm going
to got upstairs

13:37.667 --> 13:39.667
and get ready
for my real date.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.167
Did you write that,
Kel?

13:41.167 --> 13:42.667
Just say yes or no.

I know you did.

Okay, yeah, I did.

Oh, no, you didn't.
Really, Kel?

13:51.567 --> 13:57.367
Okay, Peg. No sense
in putting off the inevitable.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.000
Now, the kids
are upstairs,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.334
so we probably shouldn't
do it up there,

14:02.334 --> 14:04.801
what with your screaming
and everything.

14:04.801 --> 14:07.167
That was your fault, Al.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.834
You're the one
who turned the lights on.

14:15.234 --> 14:18.234
Hey, let's not throw stones
on this romantic night.

14:18.234 --> 14:19.234
Now, it's almost time,

14:19.234 --> 14:21.033
so why don't you
go down to the basement,

14:21.033 --> 14:22.167
blow up the air mattress?

14:22.167 --> 14:24.400
I'll pop some Tums
and be right down.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.601
I want to hear it, Al.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.501
I want to hear you say
"I love you."

14:30.501 --> 14:32.400
Not that again.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.601
Okay, Peg.

14:33.601 --> 14:35.400
Now, I know you didn't
think of this yourself.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.801
Now, where did this come from?
Phil? Oprah?

14:38.801 --> 14:40.767
Marcie.

we can't turn off.

not only say it,

14:46.801 --> 14:49.534
they mean it,
and they show it.

14:49.534 --> 14:52.234
Do you know what Marcie's
giving Steve tonight?

14:52.234 --> 14:54.734
A running start.

14:54.734 --> 14:57.234
No, she went
to Cakes a Poppin',

14:57.234 --> 14:59.234
and she's having herself
delivered to him.

14:59.234 --> 15:00.667
Then she's going
to pop out naked.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.167
I hope you're happy, Peg..

15:02.167 --> 15:05.334
I'll never
eat cake again.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.701
Al, if she can go to all that
trouble for Steve,

15:07.701 --> 15:10.534
the least you can do for me
is say "I love you."

with you unless you say it.

from me, Peg? Oh no!

just have to relax

15:28.501 --> 15:31.434
and have fun instead.

15:31.434 --> 15:34.434
Come on, Peg.
What's the big deal?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.501
You know I do.

15:36.501 --> 15:37.934
I just don't like
to say it.

15:37.934 --> 15:40.334
It...makes me sick.

15:40.334 --> 15:43.334
Well, it doesn't make me
sick to say it.

15:43.334 --> 15:44.834

and touch someone.

Yes, there's been
a change of plans.

Instead of the address
she gave you...

Do you have a pen?

16:27.200 --> 16:30.701
Bud, I don't know why
you're dressed like that.

16:30.701 --> 16:33.200
If you don't think
you really have a date,

16:33.200 --> 16:35.701
why did you pass up
a chance to go to the game?

16:35.701 --> 16:37.701
Look, maybe I just wanted
to spend the night

16:37.701 --> 16:40.200
watching the game
with my Dad.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.534
Why? What did I do?

16:42.534 --> 16:44.534
Oh, by the way, Dad,
Mom's upstairs cursing you.

16:44.534 --> 16:46.400
I'm late. I've got to go.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.567
Wait a second.
Kelly, come here a second.

16:51.601 --> 16:57.467
Now, you guys are,
what, in your teens?

16:57.467 --> 16:59.501
Something like that,
Dad, yeah.

16:59.501 --> 17:02.167
Well, you've known me
most of those years.

17:02.167 --> 17:03.968
How do you think your dad
feels about you?

17:03.968 --> 17:07.233
I mean, do you know
that your dad...

17:07.233 --> 17:08.534
Loves us?

17:08.534 --> 17:12.133
Yeah, that. You guys
know that, right?

17:12.133 --> 17:13.233
Sure.

17:13.233 --> 17:17.434
Dad, are you dying?

17:19.233 --> 17:22.233
Yes, but no one
seems to care.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.968
So, but, I mean,

17:23.968 --> 17:26.166
it's not important
for you to hear, uh...

17:26.166 --> 17:27.634
That you love us?

17:27.634 --> 17:28.801
Yes.

17:28.801 --> 17:31.400
Hey, you'll tell us
when you're ready.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.000
Yeah. Besides, we think
it would make a nice moment

17:34.000 --> 17:35.167
for when you're
old and feeble.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.534
Thank you.

for it, Kel.

a hot date coming.

But the game's on.

18:09.234 --> 18:11.767
The way I see it,
if you left now,

18:11.767 --> 18:14.267
it would kind of be
like saying...

18:14.267 --> 18:16.467
you love me.

18:29.501 --> 18:31.667
So...how you doing?

18:34.033 --> 18:35.667
Aw, come on, Peg.

18:35.667 --> 18:37.300
People shouldn't have to say it.
It's unnecessary.

18:37.300 --> 18:41.567
I haven't cheated on you.
I haven't asked for my own room.

18:41.567 --> 18:45.667

and your hotpants phase.

Doesn't that say it?

18:46.767 --> 18:48.701
No.

18:48.701 --> 18:53.234
Well, then...could I have
my own room?

18:53.234 --> 18:54.234
No!

18:54.234 --> 18:56.267
Now, I want to hear it.

18:56.267 --> 18:57.267
Why?

Because
it's nice to know.

Now, I'll start.
I love you.

my stomach hurt.

Well, then, you can
feel better real quick.

19:07.901 --> 19:08.934
Now, just say it.

19:10.634 --> 19:12.868
I...

19:12.868 --> 19:15.200
I have to go
to the bathroom.

19:24.334 --> 19:25.601

you're so immature.

quite an unusual name.

a lot in common.

20:17.501 --> 20:19.567
Well, I saw you
around school,

20:19.567 --> 20:21.167

Sorry.
I meant thank you.
