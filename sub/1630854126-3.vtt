WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.526
Ava, have you seen a--

00:04.569 --> 00:05.962
Is this you?

00:06.006 --> 00:07.572
Oh. That must have
fell in there by mistake.

00:07.616 --> 00:08.834
Mind your business.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.053
What you looking for?

00:10.097 --> 00:11.315
Uh, I lost something.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.665
What? Your sense of style?
Ha ha! Up top!

00:13.709 --> 00:14.840
No.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.146
You a hater.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.495
What'd you lose?

00:17.539 --> 00:19.497
Uh, it was a shawl
that was in my classroom.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.847
It was my warmest one.
I am so cold.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.546
- You think someone took it?
- Who would just take a shawl?

00:26.722 --> 00:30.204
Why would <i>I,</i> Ava Coleman,
take something from <i>Janine?</i>

00:31.118 --> 00:32.858
Look, I am not
accusing anyone, but--

00:32.902 --> 00:34.512
Mr. Johnson
took my shawl!

00:34.556 --> 00:36.558
Why does the lost and found have
a five-day waiting period

00:36.601 --> 00:38.734
if we're not
gonna enforce it?

00:39.735 --> 00:40.910
Aah!

00:40.953 --> 00:43.347
It's called
functional fashion.

00:43.391 --> 00:46.133
Yeah!
That shawl chose <i>him.</i>

01:00.843 --> 01:03.063
I hope all the kids
aren't here today.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.803
Yesterday,
everybody was in attendance,

01:04.847 --> 01:06.066
and it almost broke me.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.241
That's what happens
when you enforce

01:07.284 --> 01:08.894
a "no nose picking"
policy.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.244
I'm behind
on lesson plans,

01:10.287 --> 01:11.723
but it's too early in the year
to show movies.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.378
I'm doing LEGO day to catch up.
The kids love it.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.206
I always end up
with LEGO toe.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.121
Exactly. I've bought
so many packs,

01:18.165 --> 01:19.731
LEGO owes me a sponsorship already.

01:19.775 --> 01:22.125
Man, this double class
is kicking my ass.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.561
I need my extra-large
coffee mug.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.259
Did you read
that article the other day

01:25.302 --> 01:26.912
about how matcha--
actually more efficient

01:26.956 --> 01:28.740
at awakening the nervous system
than coffee?

01:28.784 --> 01:31.395
Oh, yeah? Was that in <i>
Who Gives A Crap Weekly?</i>

01:31.439 --> 01:33.223
It was in <i>The New Yorker.</i>

01:33.267 --> 01:35.269
Oh, so <i>
Who Gives A Crap Biweekly.</i>

01:39.751 --> 01:41.927
Damn. It's more intense in here
than my at-home float tank.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.451
What y'all doing?
Prepping.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.801
Mm. Working before work?
Couldn't be me.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.759
Anyway, here's a reminder
that some goofy group

01:47.803 --> 01:49.761
is coming through to do
camp songs or something,

01:49.805 --> 01:52.242
so check the schedule
to see when your class is up.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.679
Holy Shakespeare!

01:56.638 --> 01:58.248
Jacob, we can't afford
for you to have a seizure

01:58.292 --> 01:59.641
during school hours.

01:59.684 --> 02:03.253
Guys! These are
the Story Samurai, okay?

02:03.297 --> 02:04.994
They're a storytelling group
that goes all up and down

02:05.037 --> 02:08.302
the East Coast improvising
plays based on the kids' ideas.

02:08.345 --> 02:10.434
I used to be in it.

02:10.478 --> 02:13.002
Of course you were, sweetheart.

02:13.045 --> 02:17.180
The Story Samurai are like
a book come to life, okay?

02:17.224 --> 02:19.182
But the pages
are the performance

02:19.226 --> 02:22.446
and the illustrations
are, like, the lyrics.

02:22.490 --> 02:26.711
We help the kids see that
everyone is a story, okay?

02:26.755 --> 02:30.019
Look, I don't condone violence,
but it slaps.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.281
I think it sounds amazing, Jacob.

02:31.325 --> 02:32.978
I love it
when they come.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.806
You get to drop your kids off
at the auditorium for an hour

02:34.850 --> 02:37.461
- and just catch up on work.
- That part.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.463
Oh, well, then I may be
a really big fan

02:39.507 --> 02:40.638
of these Samurai-sitters.

02:40.682 --> 02:42.162
You're gonna want
to see this.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.294
It's-- It's not like
some wack puppet show.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.470
Plus, this is like
a whole new tour.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.646
It's gonna be
brand-new material.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.518
It's very subversive,
you know?

02:50.561 --> 02:52.781
And really cool.
Like me.

02:54.217 --> 02:57.089
Janine, Gregory,
y'all pulling up?

02:57.133 --> 03:00.180
Yeah.
I'll <i>walk</i> over.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.703
Yeah.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.531
Alex and Jordan.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.533
Oh, Natalie.
I'm sorry, honey.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.491
You are in
my third grade now.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
You were in my second grade
last year,

03:09.537 --> 03:12.322
and now you're in third grade,
which I also teach. Okay.

03:12.366 --> 03:14.324
I told you, we got an aide
if you need it.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.674
She's got this.
She's a veteran.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.850
Veterans don't need
that help. Exactly.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.939
You save those aides
for the young'ns.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.854
Alright, well, don't say
I didn't try to help.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.682
Everybody say young Ava
is unreliable,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.510
but even a broken clock
is right once a day.

03:26.554 --> 03:29.383
- Twice a day.
- Whatever!

03:29.426 --> 03:30.862
Um, you know,
it's a little tough.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.213
But you know what?
Barbara's right. I'm tougher.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.041
I'm so tough, brass knuckles
wear <i>me</i> to a fight.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.261
- Ooh!
- Oh. Excuse me.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.871
What? What?!

03:39.915 --> 03:43.223
Keyon! Quit huffing
the Wite-Out, dude!

03:43.266 --> 03:45.703
Samurai. Ha!

03:45.747 --> 03:49.229
May we have a suggestion
for a character?

03:49.272 --> 03:50.360
Meek Mill!

03:50.404 --> 03:51.883
Ah.
Nice one, Clarence.

03:51.927 --> 03:55.931
What if Meek Mill...
was a meerkat?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.541
Why?

03:57.585 --> 04:00.065
I'm just a meerkat, strolling
through Western Philly.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.241
But it's not a story

04:01.284 --> 04:02.372
unless there's some...

04:02.416 --> 04:03.939
Conflict!

04:03.982 --> 04:06.985
What's Meerkat Meek Mills'
conflict?

04:07.029 --> 04:10.293
His ATV broke down
in the wrong hood!

04:10.337 --> 04:13.078
Wrong hood, Meerkat!
Wrong hood!

04:13.122 --> 04:15.255
This is too corny, even for me.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.908
But Jacob loves it,
so thank goodness

04:16.952 --> 04:19.084
it's in his past
and he isn't up there.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.564
I get it, though.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.087
If my "Degrassi"
reenactment group

04:22.131 --> 04:24.916
showed up and performed here,
I'd be excited, too.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.397
Shout-out to the guy
who played the original Jimmy.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.748
Wonder what he's up to. Heh.
He is-- He's Drake.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.402
I'm aware that he is Drake. Yeah.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.665
I expected it to be corny,
but that was beyond anything

04:34.709 --> 04:36.101
I thought was
theoretically possible.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.843
I know.
It was peak Jacob.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.324
Oh, Melissa, I bet that you
would love the Story Samurai.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.760
Oh, yeah,
I just dropped my kids,

04:42.804 --> 04:44.327
and I got, like,
two lesson plans to do.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.764
And that beep means
I got an hour left

04:46.808 --> 04:48.810
and I still didn't go
to the bathroom!
Okay.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.812
My class in here, please.
Thank you.

04:50.855 --> 04:52.422
Y'all see that corny show?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.294
I was in the back crying
while bootlegging it

04:54.337 --> 04:55.425
for barbershop distribution.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.035
Guys,
it wasn't that bad.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.777
I can't <i>wait</i> until
it's my class's turn.

04:59.821 --> 05:01.605
Mr. Johnson just told me
that they've got

05:01.649 --> 05:04.347
some white boy doing
the Malcolm X Games.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.957
- Oh, my God.
- He did an ollie and said,

05:06.001 --> 05:08.308
"Plymouth Rock
didn't land on me, dude."

05:08.351 --> 05:10.353
Guys, just-- Guys.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.791
Tschoo! Story Samurais,
we slice down barriers.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.794
If you need a story,
we're in your area-er.

05:16.838 --> 05:17.839
Hey.
Huh?

05:17.882 --> 05:19.319
What did everyone think?

05:19.362 --> 05:20.885
Did you see how excited
the kids were?!

05:20.929 --> 05:22.844
- It was great.
- It was incredible.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.629
I honestly cannot wait
to see it.

05:25.673 --> 05:26.978
I told you
it was gonna be bomb!

05:27.022 --> 05:28.458
You really think
I would be a part

05:28.502 --> 05:29.981
of something
that <i>wasn't</i> bomb?

05:30.025 --> 05:31.331
Well, it was something.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.462
Something
that you can be

05:32.506 --> 05:35.378
very, very proud
you did in the past.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.467
Well, the past
has become the present,

05:37.511 --> 05:39.861
because the Samurai
have asked me, Jacob Hill,

05:39.904 --> 05:41.689
to join
the afternoon show.

05:41.732 --> 05:43.386
- Wait.
- And you said yes, right?

05:43.430 --> 05:45.083
- Yeah, of course I did.
- Oh, no.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.868
- Fantastic!
- Yes.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.870
Hey, and if you guys thought
the Malcolm X Games was cool,

05:48.913 --> 05:51.351
just wait till you see
Rosa Parks and Rec.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.526
Hey, Siri.

05:52.569 --> 05:54.179
Clear my afternoon
and set a reminder

05:54.223 --> 05:57.008
to watch this boy
embarrass himself.

05:57.052 --> 05:58.488
Janine, let me borrow your phone
so I can go live

05:58.532 --> 06:00.534
on IG and TikTok
at the same time.
Uh--

06:00.577 --> 06:02.753
It's our duty to spread this joy
to the world, y'all.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.668
It's tough times out here.
People need the laughs.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.104
The people need the laughs.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.762
Hey.
I got your Slack.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.503
By the way, thanks
for being the first one

06:13.547 --> 06:15.853
to use the Slack channel
I set up two months ago.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.420
Anyway, what's up?

06:17.464 --> 06:18.856
Um, I just wanted
to talk to you

06:18.900 --> 06:21.250
a little bit more about
this Samurai business.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.904
It's exciting, right?

06:22.947 --> 06:24.035
Oh, 100%.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.559
I'm sure back when
you were performing,

06:25.602 --> 06:28.562
you were riveting, blowing
tiny minds left and right.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.433
Guilty.
Yeah.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.871
Off that, though,
my concern is,

06:33.915 --> 06:36.700
what if you kill it
too much?

06:36.744 --> 06:39.573
Kill it too much? What?
I'm not sure I follow.

06:39.616 --> 06:43.707
Well, it's just you were
so good at it, you said,

06:43.751 --> 06:46.884
and this is a new generation
of Samurai.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.582
They need to feel good
about themselves,

06:48.625 --> 06:51.062
and they probably
can't compare.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.108
You don't want to
upstage them, do you?

06:54.762 --> 06:57.155
Wow. Janine, I didn't
even think of that.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.463
See, this is why
we're friends.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.119
Thank you...
for seeing me.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.599
You got it, bud.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.905
Alright, well, Slack me if
you got anything else, okay?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.820
You know, you can
customize the emojis.

07:09.864 --> 07:10.778
Mm-hmm.

07:12.301 --> 07:17.088
Second graders, who can tell me
which clock says 3:30?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.002
- Thank you.
- Ooh! I know!

07:18.046 --> 07:19.787
We learned this
last year!

07:19.830 --> 07:21.571
Okay, thank you, Jameel, but you
gotta do your worksheet, okay?

07:21.615 --> 07:22.790
- They gotta answer.
- I have a question.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.139
Yeah. Honey,
hang on one second.

07:24.182 --> 07:25.619
- I can help you!
- That's a preparation--

07:25.662 --> 07:26.968
No, no, no, no, sweetheart.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.448
You stay on
the third-grade side, okay?

07:28.491 --> 07:29.579
You just let them
do their thing.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.754
- Ms. Schemmenti?
- Yes?

07:30.798 --> 07:32.582
Bul tied his shoe
to the desk.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.106
He did what?
Oh! Oh, no.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.456
Ms. Schemmenti,
can I borrow you?

07:36.499 --> 07:37.631
Oh. Let me see this.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.589
Okay.
Second graders only,

07:39.633 --> 07:40.764
can you tell me

07:40.808 --> 07:43.593
which clock is saying 3:30?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.203
What the heck
did you do here?

07:45.247 --> 07:47.641
- Look. Are-- Are you okay?
- I know, I know, I know!

07:47.684 --> 07:49.599
Jameel, what are you
doing on this side?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.209
Go back to
the third-graders side.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.777
But I knew the answer, so I came
to the second-grade side.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.692
Okay, well, go back
to the third-graders side.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.128
Okay. Are you good?

07:57.172 --> 07:58.956
Oh, me? I'm... fine.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.001
I got this.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.524
Okay.
Okay.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.134
Desiree.
Where are you going?

08:03.178 --> 08:05.659
Third graders get to go
to the library by themselves.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.225
You're not
in the third grade.

08:07.269 --> 08:08.836
Depends where you sit.

08:08.879 --> 08:13.318
Okay, anybody else in the class
sitting on the wrong side,

08:13.362 --> 08:15.146
switch.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.670
What?

08:21.849 --> 08:25.505
Um, I will be right back.
Please stay quiet. Thank you.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.854
Quiet.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.683
Hey! What's up?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.554
Just saying hi.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.556
Oh. That's nice.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.384
Hi. How's your day?

08:35.427 --> 08:36.646
Surprisingly smooth.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.169
I got through 90%
of animal habitats,

08:38.213 --> 08:40.345
even though it's been a bigger
bathroom day than usual.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.695
Mm.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.697
For-- For the kids,
not for me.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.220
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah. How's your day going?

08:45.263 --> 08:46.569
Uh, my day is good.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.571
Um, taught
- the two times table.
- Oh.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.705
But I did convince Jacob
not to perform.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.533
Thank goodness.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.186
That girl
isn't ruining this for me.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.536
She can be so selfish.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.189
Like last week,
when she wouldn't pretend

08:58.233 --> 09:00.104
to be my daughter at McDonald's
so I could get a Happy Meal.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.020
So you just told him
that it's corny

09:03.064 --> 09:05.240
and that eventually we will
all end up making fun of him?

09:05.283 --> 09:07.851
No. Better.
I told a fib.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.418
To protect his feelings. Ah.

09:09.461 --> 09:12.464
Jacob just puts so much
thought into how he's perceived.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.683
And it doesn't hurt anyone,

09:13.727 --> 09:15.685
so I figured,
why burst his bubble?

09:15.729 --> 09:17.687
For one, it could stop him
from inviting us

09:17.731 --> 09:20.255
to his "Living Single"
rewatch parties.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.040
It's like, dude,
you're in a relationship.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.738
I don't--
I don't get it.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.130
But he does get
some good guest speakers.

09:26.174 --> 09:27.610
He got the guy
who played Kyle--

09:29.656 --> 09:31.483
Oh. Melissa?
Are you okay?

09:31.527 --> 09:33.398
Yes.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.574
Okay.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.015
Good.

09:44.671 --> 09:45.889
You like
that cheesesteak?

09:45.933 --> 09:47.761
We got it
from the corner store.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.893
People write off this area
as a food desert,

09:49.937 --> 09:52.243
but the culinary scene here
is so slept on.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.593
It really is.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.725
So, listen,
I am honored

09:55.769 --> 09:58.162
by the invitation
to perform with you all,

09:58.206 --> 10:01.296
but, uh, I think
I gotta sit this one out.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.255
Man. Are you serious?
We were so stoked, Sensei.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.780
Yeah, we still talk about
your legendary performances.

10:06.823 --> 10:10.653
- You are our dopest alumnus.
- Other than Josh Gad.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.263
-- Oh. Josh Gad.
-Josh Gad.
- Yeah. Olaf.

10:12.307 --> 10:15.092
I am flattered, truly,
but I got to keep

10:15.136 --> 10:18.269
my Story Kimono
up in the rafters, okay?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.662
What's up, Mr. C?

10:19.706 --> 10:23.013
Hey, Clarence.
Meet the Story Samurai.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.451
Nah. I'm good. Yep.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.627
You catch
"Last Week Tonight"?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.367
You know it.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.108
Yeah.
I bet you did.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.763
I'll see you in history,
Mr. C.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.156
That's what
it's all about, dawg.

10:35.199 --> 10:38.289
Connecting with the kids.
That's why we story.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.682
That's why we samurai.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.944
It's true.

10:40.988 --> 10:42.946
You guys should consider
working in a school,

10:42.990 --> 10:44.513
you know, full-time,
when you're out.

10:44.556 --> 10:47.864
I don't know. I was planning
on auditioning for "SNL,"

10:47.908 --> 10:50.127
or if not that,
a YouTube channel.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.956
Yeah, I'm gonna work
at my dad's hedge fund.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.697
In a school like this,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.134
you're kind of like
a firefighter for joy.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
You want to get in,
spray as much joy as possible,

10:59.746 --> 11:00.834
and then get out.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.706
<i>Big news,
Abbott Elementarians!</i>

11:03.750 --> 11:05.665
I am calling
an all-school assembly

11:05.708 --> 11:07.710
so that we can watch
our own Mr. Hill

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
<i>perform with the Story Samurai.</i>

11:10.060 --> 11:11.409
<i>It'll be like
watching The Game</i>

11:11.453 --> 11:13.716
<i>perform one night only
with G-Unit.</i>

11:13.760 --> 11:15.326
You got this, Mr. C!

11:15.370 --> 11:17.067
- Yeah, you do.
- Heh.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.549
I'm so excited
about your performance.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.725
I'm stretching so I don't
throw my back out laughing--

11:22.769 --> 11:24.248
I mean, learning.

11:24.292 --> 11:27.077
Are you ready to swing
your story sword?

11:27.121 --> 11:28.557
Yes.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.515
And, uh, you're gonna be
live streaming the whole thing?

11:30.559 --> 11:31.734
Oh, yeah!
It's gonna open

11:31.778 --> 11:33.040
a whole new corner
of TikTok for me.

11:33.083 --> 11:35.346
Well, I so appreciate
you using your platform

11:35.390 --> 11:37.044
to amplify our message.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.352
Hey, Jacob.
You aren't performing, are you?

11:41.396 --> 11:43.006
Because we already
talked about it.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.182
And remember?
No upstaging the Samurai.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.271
Yeah, but it's a whole
school assembly now,

11:47.315 --> 11:49.578
and, you know, the kids
are gonna be expecting
to see me, so, uh...

11:49.621 --> 11:52.537
Yeah, he don't want to let
all those kids down, Janine.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.192
I know what you're doing!

11:55.236 --> 11:57.368
Good, 'cause I worry
about your awareness.

11:59.414 --> 12:01.764
Hey, Jacob, can I see you
for a second in the hall?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.723
Just real quick.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.596
Don't listen to her!
We believe in you, Jacob!

12:09.250 --> 12:12.253
Hey, what's, uh--
what's going on?

12:12.296 --> 12:15.082
Um, I'm not sure--

12:16.344 --> 12:17.780
I don't think
you should perform.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.391
Look. I get it.
You think I'm rusty.

12:20.435 --> 12:21.741
But don't worry.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.220
It's-- It's muscle memory.
You know?

12:23.264 --> 12:26.093
It's like when
I ride a unicycle--That's enough.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.748
Jacob, Ava just
wants you to perform

12:28.791 --> 12:30.924
so that everyone
can laugh at you.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.795
What?

12:32.839 --> 12:34.884
Yeah, they're gonna laugh.
They're gonna laugh <i>with</i> us.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.886
It's a pretty biting satire.
It's--

12:36.930 --> 12:38.888
No, no.
They're going to laugh <i>at</i> you,

12:38.932 --> 12:41.064
because, Jacob,
the Story Samurai

12:41.108 --> 12:43.284
are corny as hell.

12:43.327 --> 12:46.809
How could the Samurai be corny?
I was in it.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.469
I'm c-corny?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.952
Jacob, you are...

12:58.995 --> 13:01.998
corny sometimes... yes.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.913
Wha--

13:03.957 --> 13:06.089
Wait. Uh-- No.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.918
I have Kendrick Lamar on vinyl.
Okay? Is <i>that</i> corny?

13:08.962 --> 13:11.268
Look, and the Samurai
are not corny, okay?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.618
They performed
at a Bernie Sanders rally.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.924
Without his permission.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.970
And those things
can be corny.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.624
Look, Jacob, at the end
of the day, I'm corny,

13:19.668 --> 13:22.540
and at the beginning of the day,
too, but I don't care as much.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.368
Okay, but that is different,
because you are

13:24.412 --> 13:26.022
- African-American.
- Dit-dit-dit!

13:26.066 --> 13:29.634
See, when you said "African,"
that's corny. It just is.

13:29.678 --> 13:32.855
Look, you are a white teacher
in a Black school.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.988
I am not Hilary Swank
in "Freedom Writers."

13:35.031 --> 13:37.468
You <i>are</i> Hilary Swank
in "Freedom Writers."

13:37.512 --> 13:39.949
You are Michelle Pfeiffer
in "Dangerous Minds."

13:39.993 --> 13:41.864
You are
Sandra Bullock in--

13:41.908 --> 13:42.952
In "Bird Box"?

13:42.996 --> 13:44.998
In "The Blind Side."

13:45.999 --> 13:47.174
Too far.
Too far, I know.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.393
I'm sorry about that.
I know.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.873
But my point is...

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
you cannot do
this performance.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.964
You will never
live it down.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.313
I'm just trying to help.

13:56.357 --> 14:00.317
You don't want to be
a corny legend.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.539
Jacob, hair and makeup
are ready for you.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.324
You know what, Ava?

14:07.368 --> 14:09.326
I don't think
I'm going to do the performance,

14:09.370 --> 14:11.024
and, um...

14:11.067 --> 14:13.896
By the way,
would a "corny" person

14:13.940 --> 14:17.030
stage a one-man show
called "The Color Urkel"?

14:17.073 --> 14:19.859
Did <i>you</i> do that?
Then yeah.

14:25.777 --> 14:29.216
Damn it, Janine! Pop-Tarts
was sponsoring the stream!

14:34.743 --> 14:36.353
Oh.
Melissa?

14:36.397 --> 14:38.529
Is this
your handiwork?

14:38.573 --> 14:41.706
Ooooh!

14:41.750 --> 14:43.056
He looked at me funny.

14:43.099 --> 14:46.886
Oh, you have been dealt
an impossible situation.

14:46.929 --> 14:47.930
Aw, come on.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
Nothing's impossible
for us.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.934
I have known you
a long time,

14:51.978 --> 14:54.284
and you are
an amazing teacher.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.200
This is no reflection
of your teaching ability.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.377
Yeah, but, you know,
you said it yourself.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.683
I got this.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.381
I believe in you,
so I know that you could,

15:04.425 --> 15:07.036
but just because you could
doesn't mean you should,

15:07.080 --> 15:09.473
and I shouldn't have
made you feel that way.

15:09.517 --> 15:14.130
Huh! Give me two classes,
girl, I'd be in Jamaica. Mm!

15:14.174 --> 15:17.220
Yeah, there was a moment
when I mentally transported

15:17.264 --> 15:20.441
to Capt'n Chucky's Crab Cakes
in Ocean City.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.095
Aww.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.925
This school district offers you
absolutely nothing,

15:25.968 --> 15:29.232
and the mere fact that they
are offering you something

15:29.276 --> 15:32.061
is all the proof
that you need.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.759
Yeah, maybe having an aide
wouldn't be so bad.

15:34.803 --> 15:38.938
And in the meantime,
I know <i>exactly</i> what you need.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.636
A bathtub
full of Prosecco.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.116
A laugh.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.509
Okay.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.990
So, wait.
- Jacob <i>isn't</i> performing now?
- No.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.079
Y'all gotta stop playing God
with that boy's life.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.428
Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.691
I truly convinced him this time
to let it go.

15:53.735 --> 15:56.129
I told him the truth,
which I feel good about,

15:56.172 --> 15:57.608
but I also feel
kinda bad about.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.349
Well, did he really
want to do it?

15:59.393 --> 16:00.785
Uh, yeah.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.266
He was over the moon
and back,

16:03.310 --> 16:06.008
but I'm just trying to save him
from embarrassment.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.488
He was gonna
look like a fool

16:07.531 --> 16:10.099
in front of the entire school
and the Internet.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.841
But he does that weekly anyway.
It's who he is.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.365
I mean, if we like him for it
and he really wanted to do it,

16:15.409 --> 16:19.152
I don't see why you would
stop him from being him.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.806
Stay in the line,
y'all.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.025
I'm Megan!

16:23.069 --> 16:25.288
I'm Harold!
And I'm Tyrone!

16:25.332 --> 16:27.551
He just ruined my favorite
Erykah Badu song.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.641
And we are
the Story Samurai!

16:30.685 --> 16:32.339
Hi-ya!

16:32.382 --> 16:34.471
I thought you were gonna
go up there, Mr. C.

16:34.515 --> 16:37.300
Well, Clarence, I-I didn't
want to steal their thunder.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.649
Ohh.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.173
It would've been mad funny
to see you up there.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.478
Cut the corners of the bread.

16:41.522 --> 16:44.177
Can we get a suggestion?
Anyone?

16:44.220 --> 16:46.179
We call him Mr. C
because he's corny.

16:46.222 --> 16:49.008
But I like his class.
It's fun.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.662
He showed us that movie,
"Summer of Soul."

16:51.706 --> 16:53.577
That was good. He's cool.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.667
- Tapenade!
- Ooh! Dijon!

16:56.711 --> 16:58.234
I have a suggestion!

16:58.278 --> 17:00.323
Who thinks Mr. Hill
should get up there?!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.327
Yes, yes!

17:15.208 --> 17:17.166
Okay.
Can <i>I</i> get a suggestion?

17:17.210 --> 17:19.516
- A tiger.
- I heard "tiger."

17:19.560 --> 17:23.346
Okay, because I'm a tiger
with stripes and big teeth,

17:23.390 --> 17:26.523
people are conditioned
to think I'm scary.

17:26.567 --> 17:29.091
The villagers
judge and harass me

17:29.135 --> 17:31.050
based on how I look.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.052
What is my conflict?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.357
Your dad thinks
you're a bum!

17:35.576 --> 17:37.186
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

17:37.230 --> 17:40.363
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I want to sell cereal,

17:40.407 --> 17:43.236
but my tiger dad wants me
to stay in the forest.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.803
Is he using a cereal
mascot to describe
racial discrimination?

17:45.847 --> 17:47.762
Mm-hmm.
- That's what he's doing.
- Okay.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.721
I was born to help make
a balanced breakfast.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.811
These stripes are feeling
like prison bars!

17:59.252 --> 18:02.733
I'm sorry. I've just
never been so inspired.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.910
Son, I support
anything you do.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.564
I just think
you need one thing

18:07.608 --> 18:10.611
so people know
you're a <i>friendly</i> tiger.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.439
This red handkerchief.

18:12.482 --> 18:17.139
Thank you, fam,
for helping me be who I am.

18:17.183 --> 18:21.100
Who I am.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.450
Who I am!

18:24.625 --> 18:26.409
Whoo!

18:29.195 --> 18:31.762
Nice! Nice! Nice!

18:31.806 --> 18:34.765
I know who I am.
I see it.

18:34.809 --> 18:38.943
I am Jacob Hill,
and it turns out...

18:38.987 --> 18:39.988
I'm corny.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.859
Corny isn't bad.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.298
It just is.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.517
- Yayyy.
- Aww.

18:49.302 --> 18:52.174
Jacob, that was
actually incredible.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.176
Actually,
it was corny.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.438
But the kids loved it.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.440
I do think the trust fall
to represent

18:57.484 --> 18:59.355
our own appropriation
was a bit much.

18:59.399 --> 19:00.965
I mean,
I would have dropped me.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.621
That was so corny,
I gained 2,000 new followers

19:04.665 --> 19:07.668
during the stream, including
Josh Gad, whoever that is.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.365
When you guys
Voltron'd yourselves

19:09.409 --> 19:12.629
into a Black Shaun King,
I-- I died. I did.

19:12.673 --> 19:15.502
- And the singing.
- And those outfits.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.200
Your curly-ass hair.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.202
That's--
That's just my hair.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.291
- Bravo, Jacob. Bravo.
- Good job, man.

19:22.335 --> 19:23.684
- Yes, yes.
- Nailed it.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.989
- You got it.
- You did that.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.600
Made my day.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.866
You think they'll ever get
how corny they are?

19:31.909 --> 19:34.912
Not a chance. They'll never
stay in one place long enough

19:34.956 --> 19:38.742
to connect with someone
who will tell them the truth.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.310
They're missing out
on the best part--

19:41.354 --> 19:42.703
connection.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.183
Hey.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.924
Can you get your corny asses
out of here so I can clean?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.927
Go on and get.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.191
- Okay.
- So your request for a teacher's
aide has been filled,

19:52.234 --> 19:53.844
and they're sending one
over today.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.063
Ohh!

19:55.106 --> 19:58.240
A Ashley Garcia
from Frankford.

19:58.284 --> 20:01.025
Eh. Frankford.
That's a toss-up.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.331
Gotta admit,
never thought I'd see

20:02.375 --> 20:04.246
<i>the</i> Melissa Schemmenti
asking for help.

20:04.290 --> 20:06.335
Okay, Ava, I'm not
in the mood, right?

20:06.379 --> 20:08.555
I'm just in the mood
to get some help.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.034
When-- When's she
getting here?

20:10.078 --> 20:13.212
Well,
it look like she's here now.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.039
Okay. Why are you
