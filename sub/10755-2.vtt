00:09.980 --> 00:14.080
You try and try, but at some
point you finally have to admit...

00:14.300 --> 00:16.263
...as much as you care
about each other...

00:16.639 --> 00:20.900
...your relationship isn't working
and hasn't been for some time.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.423
But you two wouldn't be
sitting here with me...

00:23.543 --> 00:26.820
...if you didn't want to
save this relationship.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.920
Isn't that true?

00:29.300 --> 00:31.601
I'm be willing to try.
I can't speak for...

00:31.636 --> 00:34.700
You don't have to
speak for me, Niles.

00:36.180 --> 00:40.380
-I'm perfectly capable of speaking
for myself.  -Yes, I know.

00:40.590 --> 00:43.147
Caruso wasn't so in love with
the sound of his own voice.

00:43.182 --> 00:45.290
What does that mean?

00:45.520 --> 00:47.696
Well, you tell me, Enrico.
What do you think it means?

00:47.731 --> 00:48.920
I guess I can tell you...

00:50.690 --> 00:52.690
Gentlemen!

00:53.410 --> 00:58.810
Now, are we agreed that we want
to do something to fix this problem?

01:03.900 --> 01:06.300
Why doesn't one of you
tell me how this started?

01:06.510 --> 01:12.610
Well, it began with me. Last week,
I was at work doing my radio show.

01:12.910 --> 01:16.110
I was on the air with
a troubled young woman.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.061
She had just started telling me...

01:18.096 --> 01:21.300
...about a recurring dream
she had since childhood.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.900
<i>Okay, I'm in my bedroom.</i>

01:22.935 --> 01:25.800
<i>I'd just gotten out of the
bath tub to get dressed.</i>

01:25.940 --> 01:29.540
<i>When I opened the closet,
all my clothes are gone.</i>

01:29.700 --> 01:33.431
<i>Suddenly, I hear the sound
of footsteps on the drive outside.</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:35.500
<i>I turn and there is a little girl...</i>

01:35.790 --> 01:39.190
<i>...with her nose pressed up
against the window.</i>  -Facinating!

01:39.360 --> 01:43.210
<i>But her breath is clogging up the glass
so that I can't make out her face.</i>

01:43.400 --> 01:47.300
<i>Only, I'm sure she's come to
tell me something important.</i>

01:47.610 --> 01:50.510
So, a girl...

01:50.810 --> 01:54.810
...on the other side of a
glass with an urgent message.

01:56.220 --> 01:59.420
And for some reason you're
unwilling or able to receive it.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.244
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane,
I hate to interrupt...

02:01.364 --> 02:02.963
...but you're all out of
time for today.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.320
Oh, dear.

02:04.640 --> 02:07.271
Um, listen, Jill,
I'm terribly sorry, but listen...

02:07.306 --> 02:09.440
I'd like to continue talking
to you when we're off the air...

02:09.639 --> 02:12.040
...so please don't hang up.
In the meantime, listeners...

02:12.170 --> 02:13.298
...I've enjoyed our time today.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.170
Tune in again tomorrow
when we'll be talking with...

02:16.370 --> 02:19.370
Blah, blah, Frasier Crane Show,
happy health, goodbye!

02:23.500 --> 02:28.000
-Yo, Jill. You a football fan?
<i>-Not really.</i>  -Beat it!

02:30.350 --> 02:32.850
All right, let's talk
women scum!

02:33.400 --> 02:37.100
I hate this job. Not only do I have
to put up with that annoying little...

02:37.240 --> 02:39.340
...sweat-sock...

02:39.540 --> 02:41.647
...but when a caller comes in
who has a truly fascinating problem...

02:41.682 --> 02:43.240
I'm barely even able
to scratch the surface.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.149
It makes me want to run screaming
back to private practice!

02:45.184 --> 02:47.740
I can imagine how
frustrated you must be.

02:47.940 --> 02:51.005
This show's gotta be constraining
for a man of your staggering intellect.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.040
<i>Hold it, stop, wait a minute!</i>

02:53.230 --> 02:55.139
You expect us to believe
that Roz actually...

02:55.174 --> 02:58.230
...used a phrase like
"staggering intellect"?

02:59.750 --> 03:00.972
It was something like that.

03:01.007 --> 03:04.050
So, she might have said
your "boundless brilliance..."

03:04.240 --> 03:06.531
or, say, "the Olympian
reaches of your wisdom."

03:06.566 --> 03:09.040
-Oh, Niles, do shut up.
-Oh, you shut up!

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074

03:19.230 --> 03:20.856
Gentlemen, gentlemen! It is not
important exactly what was said.

03:24.750 --> 03:29.150
What is important is that he
assumes it revolves around him...

03:29.340 --> 03:32.140
...when the truth is it started
several days before that, with me.

03:32.530 --> 03:36.030
<i>I'd been having some trouble with the
psychiatrist in the office next door.</i>

03:36.150 --> 03:39.750
<i>His unconventional therapy had
started to intrude upon my sessions.</i>

03:39.920 --> 03:43.020
Mrs. Kelly, the key here
is that you trust me.

03:43.220 --> 03:44.316
So long as you're
in this office...

03:44.351 --> 03:47.220
...you have no reason
to feel anything but safe.

03:53.630 --> 03:57.330
You must think of this as
your refuge, your sanctuary.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.636
I'm not saying that being a
sole survivor of a plane crash...

04:06.671 --> 04:08.950
...wasn't a traumatizing
experience for you.

04:11.530 --> 04:15.230
But, I can get you to a point where
the memories no longer haunt you.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.200
<i>His primal scream madness
was ruining my practice.</i>

04:24.380 --> 04:27.980
<i>I had to do something. The opportunity
presented itself that Friday.</i>

04:28.140 --> 04:31.040
<i>I'd come to Frasier's for dinner.
I remember Daphne...</i>

04:31.200 --> 04:34.900
<i>...my father's health care worker, was
telling the most delightful story...</i>

04:35.050 --> 04:37.950
Oh, I know what you're going though,
dealing with a noisy neighbour.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.140
Have I ever mentioned that couple
that lived next door to me in London?

04:42.340 --> 04:45.340
A married couple, who made
the most un-Godly racket - in bed!

04:45.650 --> 04:47.631
The walls must have
been like tissue paper...

04:47.751 --> 04:50.450
...because I'd hear the whole
performance every night.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.161
Finally, I decided the
only to get them...

04:53.196 --> 04:55.248
...to stop was to let them hear
what I'd been hearing.

04:55.283 --> 04:59.270
So, one night, I moved
near the wall and I started...

05:21.150 --> 05:23.550
Problem solved.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.156
I'm sorry, Daphne, I drifted.

05:27.191 --> 05:29.670
Would you mind
telling that story again?

05:31.150 --> 05:33.750
<i>Hold it, stop! Niles, you know
full well that Daphne merely...</i>

05:33.870 --> 05:36.550
...told us that story,
she did not act it out.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.360
-Didn't she?  -No!
Just tell the story!  -Fine.

05:42.660 --> 05:45.660
<i>It was a few hours later.
We were having espresso...</i>

05:45.900 --> 05:47.686
<i>...and, perhaps to counter-act
the stimulative effect...</i>

05:47.806 --> 05:49.600
<i>...Frasier was telling
us about his day.</i>

05:49.800 --> 05:52.900
You know, I can't stop thinking
about my last caller today.

05:53.100 --> 05:55.100
Fascinating young woman...

05:55.300 --> 05:56.627
...who had a recurring dream.

05:56.662 --> 06:00.200
You know who's a hell of
a dreamer? Eddie.

06:01.460 --> 06:04.460
One night I'd wake up,
he's lying on my forehead...

06:04.670 --> 06:08.970
...dead asleep, with a big clump
of my hair in his mouth, growlin'!

06:10.240 --> 06:13.940
Bet you'd love to analyze
that little brain of his.

06:15.050 --> 06:18.650
Yes, that would be the jewel
in the crown of my career!

06:21.580 --> 06:23.823
Still, thinking about
this woman has...

06:23.858 --> 06:26.780
...started me longing
for private practice.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.570
I guess I just miss the chance
to dig deep with my patients.

06:30.770 --> 06:33.770
-Have you considered seeing patients
on the side?  -Oh yes, of course.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.881
I've got a list of people
who've expressed interest.

06:35.916 --> 06:38.960
Frasier, I have a proposition.

06:39.270 --> 06:44.070
I mentioned that doctor in the office
next door? Well, his lease is up.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.070
If you were interested in
his office, as his landlord...

06:47.290 --> 06:50.790
...I could tell him and his
screaming meamies to hit the road!

06:53.690 --> 06:56.490
You and I...

06:56.990 --> 06:59.490
...Working side by side?

07:04.150 --> 07:06.550
I don't mind telling you
the prospect...

07:06.780 --> 07:10.580
...sounds quite exciting!  -We could
consult on each other's patients.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.880
-We could give seminars together.
-Even therapy groups!  -Oh, my God!

07:13.990 --> 07:17.290
"Crane & Crane", I can see our logo
already; a giant Crane hovering...

07:17.480 --> 07:19.780
...over a human head!

07:22.970 --> 07:25.422
Dad, why are you laughing?
Why is Dad laughing?

07:25.542 --> 07:27.670
You two, you'll never learn.

07:27.990 --> 07:31.090
-Oh, oh, you think this is a bad idea?
-The restaurant you bought together...

07:31.270 --> 07:33.670
...that was a bad idea!

07:33.980 --> 07:38.680
The book you tried to write together,
that was a bad idea! But this...

07:41.490 --> 07:44.490
No, that restaurant was
still the stupidest one.

07:46.430 --> 07:49.630
-Two little mis-adventures and you
doom us to failure.  -Oh, baloney.

07:49.850 --> 07:53.150
You've been like this since you were
kids. You two can't work together.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.859
Maybe Dad's right.
We're not ready for this.

07:55.894 --> 07:58.740
-It could lead to conflict and tension.
<i>-Hold it!</i>

07:58.950 --> 08:01.270
-Niles, tell the truth!
-Oh, all right.

08:01.305 --> 08:04.250
Stop raining on our parade, Dad!

08:04.680 --> 08:06.980
To "Crane & Crane"!

08:11.380 --> 08:15.080
Well, our first day together
began innocently enough...

08:15.250 --> 08:19.050
-Good morning, Dr. Crane.
-And to you, Dr. Crane

08:20.800 --> 08:23.700
Oh, Niles, why should we be so
formal, there's nobody around.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.000
-It's a hi-five, Niles!
-Oh, oh, oh, sorry.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.900
-Coffee?
-Oh, yes, please.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.100
Oh, Niles, I can't tell you
how much I've missed that.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.300
The smell of the office place.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.400
...Freshly oiled leather
couches, the pungent coffee...

08:48.600 --> 08:51.253
...the aroma of an
exotic luncheon special...

08:51.288 --> 08:52.800
...wafting up from
the cafeteria below.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.550
Actually, that's the lab next
door. They lost power last night...

08:55.730 --> 08:58.130
...some of their
tissue samples turned.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.805
By the way, I've put together
some recent articles...

09:04.840 --> 09:07.160
...you may want to peruse
just to get up to speed.

09:09.110 --> 09:11.910
-Up to speed?
-Well...

09:12.190 --> 09:13.712
...it has been a while
since you've practised...

09:13.747 --> 09:16.190
...and we could all
use a little brushing up.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.600
Well, that's very considerate of you.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.300
-Just put my homework assignment
in my box there.  -As you wish.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.400
All right, where shall
we put this then?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.124
-Well, the only place
it should go, actually...

09:44.159 --> 09:45.299
...is right here by the couch, I think.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.900
No, no, Daphne, here on the desk...

09:48.050 --> 09:49.427
...will pick up the
earth tones in the carpet.

09:49.462 --> 09:52.250
No, there's this desk space
here by the coffee station.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.002
Oh, underneath the heating vent?!

09:54.037 --> 09:56.990
Why not just give it
a blindfold and a cigarette!

09:57.300 --> 10:00.500
-It's your office, put it where
you like.  -No, no, it is your plant.

10:00.620 --> 10:03.820
And it's my bleedin' back, so I'm
putting it right here!

10:04.420 --> 10:07.920
Honestly, I don't know how
you put up with him.

10:08.210 --> 10:13.610
<i>-Liar! Liar! Daphne never said that!</i>
-Well, she said it with body language.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.760
I happen to be fluent in that language
and she said nothing of the kind!

10:19.020 --> 10:21.420
Will someone tell me what's
so important about this plant?

10:21.620 --> 10:24.320
You'll know soon enough. I'm
telling the rest of the story.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.820
I'm putting it right here!

10:28.580 --> 10:32.880
You know the best thing about getting
old? Your hair may turn grey...

10:33.060 --> 10:36.660
...your joints may stiffen, you
may even have to walk with a cane.

10:36.910 --> 10:40.610
But people still ask you
to help them move!

10:44.650 --> 10:46.699
Forgive me for
overburdening you, Dad.

10:46.734 --> 10:49.350
Could you just put those
in my office, please?

10:52.230 --> 10:55.530
Oh, look at your two names
together on the door.

10:56.500 --> 11:00.300
Er, Dr. Crane, is your brother's
name smaller than yours?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.497
Yes, that was the
only way it would fit.

11:02.532 --> 11:05.000
I assumed you wouldn't mind -
after all, we're concerned here...

11:05.200 --> 11:07.700
...with healing people, aren't we?

11:08.360 --> 11:10.560
Of course, Niles.

11:11.010 --> 11:12.765
If I were interested
in self-promotion...

11:12.800 --> 11:16.710
...I guess I'd be content
with my radio show...

11:17.210 --> 11:21.110
...heard every day by over
half a million listeners...

11:21.410 --> 11:25.210
...the Pacific Northwest
and parts of Canada!

11:28.010 --> 11:30.066
-What are you doing?
-I'm moving the Chepalire.

11:30.101 --> 11:31.010
I like it where it was.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.710
Yes, but it didn't like it
there. It wants light.

11:33.940 --> 11:37.440
You two tend to your plant,
I'll go fetch the file cabinet!

11:37.640 --> 11:39.599
I have had this plant
for two years...

11:39.634 --> 11:40.740
...and it has never been
in direct sunlight.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.100
Well, obviously, look at it,
the leaves are puckering!

11:43.280 --> 11:44.765
They are not,
they've wilted a little...

11:44.800 --> 11:45.919
from the ride over
in the trunk of the car.

11:45.954 --> 11:46.680
Oh, nonsense...

11:46.880 --> 11:50.530
...Mafia snitches emerge from car
trunks looking more robust!

11:50.730 --> 11:54.530
-This plant is going right over...
-And so it begins!

11:57.130 --> 11:59.830
<i>Of course, the incident with the
plant was only the beginning.</i>

12:00.040 --> 12:02.434
That was followed by a run-in
at the receptionist's desk...

12:02.469 --> 12:04.740
...a row at the coffee machine,
and a contretemps...

12:04.940 --> 12:06.612
...when Frasier lost
the men room's key.

12:06.647 --> 12:10.140
-That was an accident.
-Yes, it very nearly was.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.820
I am so tired of
your exaggeration.

12:14.020 --> 12:17.820
You always make things fifteen
thousand times worse than they are!

12:18.650 --> 12:21.250
I'm going to tell
the story from now on!

12:21.910 --> 12:25.530
<i>The point is, our nerves were,
well, pretty much shot...</i>

12:25.565 --> 12:28.910
<i>...by the time we conducted
our first therapy group together...</i>

12:29.120 --> 12:32.320
First off, I have a
colleague to introduce.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.213
He is not only an
esteemed psychiatrist...

12:34.248 --> 12:36.850
...he happens to be my brother,
Dr. Frasier Crane.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.650
Afternoon.

12:38.850 --> 12:44.150
-Wow, you're Dr. Crane from the radio.
-Guilty as charged.

12:44.470 --> 12:46.507
Yes, but we all have to
remind Dr. Crane that...

12:46.542 --> 12:48.570
...this is real psychiatry now,
not the radio.

12:48.710 --> 12:51.810
No hanging up on
the hard ones here!

12:55.700 --> 12:58.977
But rest assured I am trained
to deal with a full range of issues.

12:59.012 --> 13:03.390
Everything from
envy to jealousy.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.180
But...

13:06.330 --> 13:07.524
...I'll just be observing today.

13:07.559 --> 13:10.330
I don't know you well enough
to render any opinions yet, so just...

13:10.540 --> 13:14.440
-...pretend I'm not here.
-And good luck with that.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.444
Mrs. Kalish, perhaps you could
bring us up to date...

13:20.479 --> 13:22.160
...on how you're dealing
with your divorce.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.160
-This is week two, isn't it?
-Yes.

13:27.950 --> 13:33.050
-Well, I actually had my first
date last night.  -That's wonderful.

13:36.430 --> 13:40.030
-Did you say something?
-I don't think so.

13:40.330 --> 13:44.630
It sounded like "Hmmm..."
like you disapproved.

13:45.900 --> 13:48.600
Well, since you've asked.

13:49.240 --> 13:53.058
I think in divorce we
have painful feelings...

13:53.093 --> 13:55.040
...which are never the
less healthy feelings.

13:55.350 --> 13:57.832
We start to date too quickly and
we want to be sure that...

13:57.867 --> 14:00.250
...that's not panacea for the pain.

14:01.070 --> 14:03.000
Ooh, yes, you'll all find
my brother's quite adept...

14:03.035 --> 14:05.870
...with those peppy little bromides;
"panacea for the pain"!

14:06.160 --> 14:07.126
You can almost hear the phrase:

14:07.161 --> 14:11.160
We'll be right back after
these words from "Pringles"!

14:12.460 --> 14:15.249
You don't want to wait too long
before you date though, either.

14:15.284 --> 14:17.260
I waited five years.

14:17.460 --> 14:20.960
But then I was so desperate I stayed
with the first woman who came along.

14:21.150 --> 14:25.750
She ended up being the same controlling
ice princess as my first wife.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.770
-Well, Mr. Carr...
-Wait, Dr. Crane.

14:28.805 --> 14:31.480
It sounded like your brother
said something again.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.360
Well, since you've asked.

14:37.340 --> 14:40.132
It occurred to me that by
waiting for five years...

14:40.167 --> 14:43.140
...and becoming,
as you said, desperate...

14:43.870 --> 14:45.997
...that perhaps you were
really giving yourself...

14:46.032 --> 14:49.670
...license to pursue the woman
who reminded you of your first wife.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.097
You had to repeat the pattern.

14:51.132 --> 14:54.180
So, you're saying that it
wasn't an accident?

14:55.050 --> 14:57.106
-We have an expression in psychiatry:
"there are no accidents."

14:57.141 --> 15:00.650
Now let's check in
with news and traffic.

15:03.850 --> 15:07.550
Dr. Crane, are you denying that most
accidents happen for a reason?

15:07.690 --> 15:10.190
No, Dr. Crane,
I believe they do.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.860
I'm reminded of a recent "accident"
involving a four-inch wooden block...

15:14.070 --> 15:18.170
...attached to a men's room key which
walked off in somebody's pocket!

15:19.150 --> 15:21.588
Clearly an act of hostility,
wouldn't you say?!

15:21.708 --> 15:23.650
Certainly a well-deserved
one considering...

15:23.800 --> 15:27.200
...what an insufferable
prig someone has been today!

15:27.570 --> 15:30.770
You dare call me a prig
after I rescued you...

15:30.960 --> 15:33.760
from that sideshow you call
a radio program?  -One more crack...

15:33.880 --> 15:35.747
...about my show and I'll put
that little wooden block...

15:35.782 --> 15:38.180
...in a place you'll always
be able to find it!

15:40.670 --> 15:44.070
Group, take five minutes of
quiet introspection!

15:49.650 --> 15:53.250
Frasier, I have made a fist and
I'm thinking of using it.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.792
Niles, you are not scaring me...

15:56.827 --> 15:59.850
The thumb goes on the outside,
Niles! On the outside!

16:01.780 --> 16:04.680
-How dare you try to steal
my group!  -I don't need your group!

16:04.840 --> 16:08.590
-I've got a group of my own, half a
million strong!  -Oh yes, your legions!

16:08.860 --> 16:10.050
Why don't you rent a farm...

16:10.085 --> 16:13.360
...pass out the body paint
and call it "Frasier-stock"!

16:14.190 --> 16:16.190
You know, I'm just a little tired
of your condescending attitude.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.688
You have not missed
one single opportunity...

16:17.808 --> 16:18.772
... to run down my show or
grab a book off the shelf...

16:20.016 --> 16:21.270
...to help me "get up to speed!"

16:21.480 --> 16:22.974
My God, you're such
a brilliant healer...

16:23.009 --> 16:24.530
...you've even taken over
the care of my Schefflera!

16:24.670 --> 16:27.270
-Well, you were starving it
of sunlight!  -All right, fine.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.880
Let's just give this little dear
all the sunlight it needs!

16:36.590 --> 16:38.590
Are you insane?!

16:38.740 --> 16:42.740
If I were, "Doctor,"
you'd never know it!

16:52.450 --> 16:56.150
Is that my group?
Group, group, come back, group!

16:56.670 --> 16:59.970
I'm very proud of this
show of independence!

17:00.260 --> 17:05.260
-I hope you're happy!  -If I were,
"Doctor," you'd never know it!

17:05.490 --> 17:08.290
Stop saying that!

17:09.290 --> 17:12.390
-Dr. Crane!  -Hello,
Dr. Schachter.  -What's going on?

17:12.599 --> 17:13.753
I'm having a discussion
with my brother.

17:13.789 --> 17:16.900
I could hear your discussion
across the hall in my office.

17:17.180 --> 17:19.980
Well, you see, he waltzed in here
like the belle of the ball and yet...

17:22.200 --> 17:26.200
Now, look, you two are
obviously in some distress.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.280
As you know, I am a
specialist in couples therapy.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.228
Now I've never treated
brothers before, but still...

17:33.263 --> 17:36.500
...if you step into my office,
I'm sure I can help you.

17:36.690 --> 17:40.690
<i>Hold it! Hold it! I never said,
"I'm sure I can help you."</i>

17:41.090 --> 17:44.290
I said, "I may be
able to help you."

17:44.580 --> 17:49.080
-See how he twists your words?
-Right here, buddy boy.

17:49.470 --> 17:54.170
Enough! You are doctors! I've never
seen anything like this in my life.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.732
You think he's trying to
steal your patients...

17:56.767 --> 17:59.895
...and you think he's trying
to undermine you as a psychiatrist.

17:59.930 --> 18:03.510
But you must know what is
at the root of this problem.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.400
He is!

18:05.600 --> 18:07.100
No.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.990
You have a fundamental
lack of trust.

18:11.190 --> 18:15.390
Now it may be so deeply rooted by now
that it's impossible to change...

18:15.510 --> 18:18.808
...but there are certain
exercises that we try...

18:18.843 --> 18:20.710
...provided that you two are willing.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.600
Let's start with the most
basic trust exercise there is.

18:30.400 --> 18:34.700
Now, why don't you simply
stand on this foot stool...

18:34.940 --> 18:39.640
...and fall backwards into
your brother's waiting arms...

18:39.850 --> 18:43.700
...thus demonstrating that
we can trust each other.

18:43.850 --> 18:47.050
-Dr. Crane, why don't you go first?
-Well, all right.

18:47.490 --> 18:51.090
-Just get up there, and let
yourself go.  -All right.

18:57.290 --> 18:59.690
Is he standing
directly behind me?

18:59.890 --> 19:03.190
Yes, now trust your brother.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.920
I'd feel better if he
were wearing rubber soles.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.820
Oh, for God's sake, Niles, just get
down, I'll go first. All right?

19:18.550 --> 19:23.350
-Is he in position?
-Yes! Trust him!

19:27.200 --> 19:30.100
You should know he
catches like a girl!

19:32.790 --> 19:35.190
I don't believe this.
Get down, will you?

19:35.400 --> 19:39.000
This couldn't be easier!
I get up here...

19:39.200 --> 19:43.100
...I count to three, and you
catch me. One, two, three.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.170
-Why didn't you catch him?!
-Well, you were closer!

19:49.320 --> 19:51.720
-It was your turn!
-"It was my turn"...!

19:51.950 --> 19:54.150
That is it! That is it!

19:54.380 --> 19:57.380
In thirty years as
a couples therapist...

19:57.570 --> 20:00.770
...I've never said what
I'm about to say:

20:01.190 --> 20:03.390
Give up!

20:05.260 --> 20:10.760
It's hopeless! You are pathologically
mistrustful of each another!

20:11.130 --> 20:15.130
Competitive to the point of madness!

20:16.140 --> 20:20.640
So, trust me, just meet
each other at weddings...

20:20.840 --> 20:24.040
...and funerals, and
the rest of the time...

20:24.320 --> 20:27.820
...stay the hell away
from each other!

20:28.610 --> 20:32.310
Now, I am going to limp
to the nearest pub...

20:32.520 --> 20:37.020
...and drink until the rest
of me is as numb as my ass!

20:47.960 --> 20:50.160
That's quite a diagnosis.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.560
Yes.

20:54.940 --> 20:59.340
But there is no denying it.
We are...

20:59.630 --> 21:04.430
-...vindictive and competitive...
-Petty, mistrustful...

21:04.680 --> 21:06.193
As so often in these cases...

21:06.228 --> 21:10.080
...it took someone outside
our situation to point it out to us.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.940
Well, Dad always said it,
but he has no credentials.

21:15.310 --> 21:18.519
Well, there's no arguing
with Dr. Schachter's credentials.

21:18.554 --> 21:21.110
My God, the man
is an expert in his field.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.620
He graduated from
the University of...

21:27.430 --> 21:29.930
...Grenada!

21:32.730 --> 21:34.801
Well, surely that was just his
undergraduate schooling.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.430
Oh yes, of course,
his graduate work was done in...

21:39.510 --> 21:41.710
...Aruba!

21:43.710 --> 21:48.010
An all-Caribbean schooling...
well, tally me banana!

21:50.050 --> 21:52.169
I knew he was a fraud the
minute he opened his mouth.

21:52.204 --> 21:54.550
Oh, I'll have him out of his
lease at the end of the week.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.158
Niles, we still have time
to catch a late lunch!

21:57.193 --> 21:59.710
Oh, oh, oh, "Peris" is just around
the corner.  -Away we go.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.633
Oh, "Chez Shea" is just as close.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.640
Yes but the food at
"Peris" is much better.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.840
Oh, Niles.
