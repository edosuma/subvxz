Lunch boxes,

17:26.879 --> 17:28.630
coffee mugs,

17:28.714 --> 17:31.050
funny foam.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.010
They took the foam off
the market,

17:33.093 --> 17:34.553
because they found out
it was poisonous.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.638
But if ask me,
if you're dumb enough to eat it,

17:36.722 --> 17:38.057

-What?

I can't believe
you're not still popular.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.396

Screw up like the Beatles

17:44.480 --> 17:46.273

bigger than Jesus?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.817
All the time. It was the title
of our second album.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.947
But we were about to learn
an iron law of show business--

17:54.031 --> 17:56.283
what goes up must come down.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.368
What about Bob Hope?

17:58.452 --> 18:00.454
He's been consistently popular
for over 50 years.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.455
So is Sinatra.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.957
Well, anyway, we were all
getting tired of--

18:04.041 --> 18:05.334
Dean Martin still packs
them in.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.377
-Ditto Tom Jones.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.381
So how did you
spend your summer?

19:34.464 --> 19:36.216
I made millions in software

19:36.300 --> 19:38.844

a few things I don't get.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.303
Like, how come we never
heard about this until today?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.971
Yeah, and what happened
to the money you made?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.473
Why haven't you hung up
your gold records?

20:24.556 --> 20:27.017
