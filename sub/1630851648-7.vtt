00:16.320 --> 00:18.760

Oi, move!

I'll do you!

Urgh!

00:35.120 --> 00:36.840
DANIEL: 'I was prepared to miss you.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.400

"and his word is not in us."

01:38.240 --> 01:40.760
And God's word is not in us.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.120
Hm.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.960
What do you make of it?

01:43.960 --> 01:47.760
We must face our sins or there'll
be no room in our hearts for God.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.640
Very well put.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.520
The thing is I...

01:53.040 --> 01:56.720
..think I started to believe
that what I was doing...

01:58.160 --> 01:59.920
..that it wasn't really a sin.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.400
If we don't address our sins,
then they only fester

02:04.400 --> 02:07.360
and we can't hope to realise
the life God wants for us.

I'm truly grateful for your time,
Chaplain.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.560
Oh, and I for yours.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.840
Usually, inmates only come here
to steal the communion wine.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.080
Bring your sins into the light,
Mr Finch.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.960
Into the light.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.040
A pint of your finest, please, Tina.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.640
Evening, Officer.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.480
One pint, then I'm off home.
Absolutely. One pint.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.360

Thanks.

Hm?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.120
It's Tuesday.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.040
The year's 1958

03:50.760 --> 03:53.200
There's nothing wrong
with these brain cells.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.800
Only cos they're pickled.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.200
Out with Johnny, were you?

03:58.160 --> 03:59.600
Er, no. Will.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.880
May I?

04:15.720 --> 04:18.880
My mother always says, "There's no
greater disappointment in life

04:18.880 --> 04:20.320
"than having to eat alone."

04:21.480 --> 04:25.000
Though I suspect she was talking
about filet mignon at the Ritz,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.640
rather than whatever this is.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.680
Elroy.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.280
Leonard.
Oh...

04:34.400 --> 04:36.120
The homosexual curate.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.920
Did they catch you in flagrante?

04:43.880 --> 04:45.040
No.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.440
I was in a club.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.120
The police raided it.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.400
They were decent enough to wait
until I found my apparel

04:52.400 --> 04:54.200
before they arrested me.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.160
Look, don't worry.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.600
Practically everyone in here's
a fairy. Didn't you realise?

05:01.880 --> 05:03.680
Even if they weren't before...

05:03.680 --> 05:05.800
they likely will be
by the time they leave.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.400
For every pansy who walks in,
two walk out.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.520
It's a veritable breeding ground
in here.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.480
Interesting sartorial choice.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.440
Dining unshod.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.720
I misplaced my shoes.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.200
Joe stole them.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.960
Oh, he's not a bad chap
beneath it all.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.680
You are joking.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.600
Are you eating that?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.760
No.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.680
This is a statement of intent.
Our mission, if you will.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.560
Mission? Sounds daunting.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.400
I've divided it
into six categories.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.440
Worship. Service to community.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.800
Parish organisation.
Parentheses.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.520
Upkeep.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.680
Discipleship?
Discipleship.

05:55.680 --> 05:58.160
Civic duty
and maintaining a worshipful life.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.840
You've just rewritten the Bible,
Henry.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.480
Don't you ever stop?

06:02.480 --> 06:04.000
Read a book, watch television.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.120
It's your television.
It's yours, too.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.800
Mi casa, su casa.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.160
Technically, "su casa"
is the church's casa.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.880
It's your home, too.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.000
And I want you to feel happy there.
And relaxed.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.120
Some of the time at least.

06:17.120 --> 06:20.240
She's back. And she's cooking eggs
in my kitchen!

06:24.840 --> 06:26.200
Hello, Billy.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.920
Hello, handsome chap.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.600
Over easy or sunny-side up?

06:35.840 --> 06:38.640
Darling Amelia chucked me out.
What did you do?

06:38.640 --> 06:40.720
Oh, of course.
It must be something that I've done!

06:43.360 --> 06:44.840
I'm homeless.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.960
Destitute.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.440
Oh, come on.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.640
Doesn't the church have
an obligation to protect me?

06:49.640 --> 06:50.840
No.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.920
Esmeralda claimed sanctuary
in Notre-Dame

06:52.920 --> 06:54.600
and hunchback
simply had to help her.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.000
Come on, say that again!

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Hey, Daniel, Daniel, calm down...
Get off me.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.400
Bloody nutcase.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.520
Get out of here!

07:01.520 --> 07:04.120
What did he say?
It's always blackmail.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.640
Easy pickings with
the village pansy. Daniel...

07:06.640 --> 07:07.960
Everyone knows, don't you?

07:07.960 --> 07:09.520
You all know, don't you?!
Daniel!

07:09.520 --> 07:10.840
Go home.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.120
Why won't he write to me?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.800
Hi, son.
Oh, sit down, Dad.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.520
Darling!

07:26.520 --> 07:28.040
SHE CHUCKLES

07:28.040 --> 07:29.600
Oh, have you lost weight?

07:29.600 --> 07:31.480
You ought to market it to your pals.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.120
"The incarceration diet."

07:39.720 --> 07:41.440
You look well.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.360
Geordie sends his regards.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.720
Mrs C, Jack.

07:48.040 --> 07:49.680
How's the new curate?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.320
Well, he's not you.

07:53.280 --> 07:54.560
Be kind to him.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.560
It's terrifying when you're new.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.920
I, er...

08:00.920 --> 08:02.040
I saw Daniel.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.880
Why won't you write to him?

08:05.840 --> 08:07.520
I have to take
this time to reflect...

08:08.480 --> 08:09.800
..on my situation...

08:10.760 --> 08:11.880
..my failings.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.040
Your failings? What failings?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.480
You don't deserve to be in here.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.240
Don't you dare start thinking that.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.000
But I am here, Will.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.760
And if I'm going to survive this...

08:24.760 --> 08:26.520
WOMAN: Elroy...
No!

08:26.520 --> 08:28.000
Elroy, sit down, please.
No!

08:28.000 --> 08:29.720
Please...
WARDEN: Calm down now.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.400
Come on.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.320
GEORDIE: Will's here.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.440
Happy anniversary.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.960
You forgot.
CATHY: He forgot.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.360
Happy anniversary.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.120
Oh, you shouldn't have!

08:58.120 --> 09:00.000
I will, er, leave you to it.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.760
Well, may as well have a pint...

09:01.760 --> 09:03.640
while you're here.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.640
You don't mind, do you, love?

09:06.640 --> 09:08.720
Marriage is a form of slavery.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.880
Hardly worth celebrating anyway.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.800
And you're in my bad books, too.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
Don't send him home
rolling drunk tonight.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.200
It's like Leonard's just given up.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.080
Like the spirit's gone out of him.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
Incarceration will do that to a man.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.400
All you have is endless fear...

09:33.120 --> 09:34.840
..and endless time to dwell on it.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.600
How did you cope?
Hm?

09:37.600 --> 09:39.560
In Burma, as a POW.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.040
Ah, you find a way.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.680
Perhaps you could speak to Leonard.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.240
Advise him.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.880
The last thing he wants
is me boring him with war stories.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.280
You have some understanding
of what he's going through.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.320
No

09:55.480 --> 09:56.720

Get Milton now!

10:37.080 --> 10:38.600
I didn't do it.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.120
They'll say it was me.
But I didn't do it.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.200
No, it wasn't me!

10:45.200 --> 10:47.240
It wasn't me! No!
Come here.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.000
It wasn't...

I ask that you report it to myself.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.000
Myself only.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.200
Speculation and rumour...

11:16.360 --> 11:18.440
..will not be tolerated.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.040
Nor will any kind of unrest.

You heard the Governor, back inside.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.120
Mr Milton...

11:36.560 --> 11:38.240
Sir...

11:38.240 --> 11:40.400
Joe protested his innocence.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.760
I believe him.
Do you hear that, Reverend?

11:44.760 --> 11:47.760
The degenerate
believes the murderer.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.560
You said come to you.
With information.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.080
Not maudlin theories
concocted by a pervert.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.040
Elroy was found in the bath.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.320
Face down, fully clothed.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.040
Do you know why Joe's here?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.680
He killed his own mother.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.480
He drowned her in the bath...

12:11.480 --> 12:13.000
face down, fully clothed.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.960
All we can do now...

12:15.920 --> 12:17.080
..is pray.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.280
Men!

12:22.280 --> 12:23.800
Useless, the lot of them.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.840
Oh, we don't have the monopoly
on uselessness.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.360
Look, how about I throw you
an anniversary party?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.080
We could all do
with some cheering up.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.160
We'll make it a surprise, shall we?

12:33.160 --> 12:35.680
Well, Geordie can't forget
if he doesn't know about it.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.000

12:59.480 --> 13:00.920
Sinner or saint?
'It's Leonard.'

13:00.920 --> 13:02.880
Leonard, how are you?
Is it terribly grim?

13:02.880 --> 13:05.200
Give it here! Leonard?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.720
'Will, I need your help.'

13:09.520 --> 13:11.880
Joseph Davies killed his own mother.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.480
Nasty little bastard.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.440
And now he kills Elroy Hastings?
He confessed to it.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.160
I heard it with my own ears.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.120
Like I say, he's a nasty little...
Yeah, we get the picture, Mr Milton.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.400
Were the two men at odds?
No more than most.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.720
But if you put a group of deviants
in an enclosed space,

13:28.720 --> 13:31.080
something like this
is bound to happen eventually.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.920
May we see Joe?

13:32.920 --> 13:34.520
He's in confinement.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.080
KEY RATTLES IN THE LOCK

13:41.080 --> 13:42.600
Here, don't...!

13:42.600 --> 13:45.040
MILTON: You tell these men
the God's honest truth now.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.040
Just as you told me.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.760
Joe, I'm a friend of Leonard's.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.680
Give him some space, Will.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.320
You lose all sense of yourself
in a place like this.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.600
No up, no down.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.240
No near or far.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.280
Hm?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.400
JOE: I don't like the dark.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.080
Well, you tell us what happened,
Joe, and I'll get you out of here.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.560
No more darkness.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.800
I didn't do it.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.160
I didn't kill anyone.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
I didn't kill anyone. I didn't...

14:43.440 --> 14:44.720
What do you mean?

14:44.720 --> 14:46.640
Joe?
Are you spinning lies?

14:46.640 --> 14:48.840
I didn't. Please...

14:50.880 --> 14:53.400
Well, I can see how you got
your confession, Mr Milton.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.880
Did you beat him yourself

14:54.880 --> 14:56.880
or did you get someone else
to do your dirty work?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.000
My men will see you out.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.720
No...

15:03.720 --> 15:05.920
HE WHIMPERS

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
No! No, you can't leave me, no!
Don't leave me!

15:08.920 --> 15:10.200
No!

15:11.240 --> 15:13.120
Keep a fella in there long enough...

15:13.120 --> 15:15.120
they always lose their mind.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.080
The bastard was enjoying it.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.840
He was enjoying Joe's suffering.

15:27.040 --> 15:29.680
They can't keep him in there,
can they? It's barbaric.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.480
Barbarism's the whole point, Will.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.200
He was telling the truth,
don't you think?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.560
You might say anything
to get out of that place.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.200
What if he's innocent? What if he
doesn't belong in there at all?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.240
Maybe we should speak to his father.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.840
WARDEN: Ten minutes.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.760
DOOR CLOSES

16:14.840 --> 16:17.320
We're trying to piece together
a few things, Mr Davies...

16:18.280 --> 16:19.760
..about the night your wife died.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.440
I don't...

16:22.440 --> 16:23.880
I don't remember much.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.240
They say I had a...

16:28.240 --> 16:30.320
They say I had a breakdown.
That...

16:31.880 --> 16:33.200
..what I saw...

16:35.360 --> 16:37.080
..I about lost me mind.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.120
The doctor, he made me, erm...

16:39.120 --> 16:42.520
He made me have electric shock
therapy. But the memories, they...

16:43.720 --> 16:45.280
..they started to come back.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.280
What did you see?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.400
I saw my son.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.040
He's holding my Issie under water.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.360
She...

17:02.480 --> 17:04.040
She wasn't moving.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.280
He was never a violent boy.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.720
So, you saw what he did?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.960
You saw Joe kill your wife?

17:23.760 --> 17:25.040
I tried...

17:26.960 --> 17:29.480
I tried so hard to forget.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.600
I wish...

17:36.200 --> 17:37.760
I wish I could forget.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.440
Ah, veritas.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.760
Truth.
Mm.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.560
What do you think these mean?

18:36.560 --> 18:38.440
I don't know,
phases of the moon, perhaps.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.200
Sorry to break your reverie,
you have a visitor.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.200
My son talked of you fondly.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.800
I have no-one else to turn to,
Mr Finch.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.120
I don't see what help I can be.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.120
They told me Elroy died...

19:08.160 --> 19:10.520
..because he was a homosexual.

19:10.520 --> 19:13.840
Rather like it was the punishment
he deserved.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.000
You think he deserved it, too?
No.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.520
No, I just...

19:23.520 --> 19:24.680
I forget.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.880
Not all of you are like Elroy.

19:29.840 --> 19:30.920
And how's that?

19:32.120 --> 19:33.480
At peace.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.720
Certain you don't belong here.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.840
Elroy told me something
in confidence.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.440
Information about this place.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.760
I really don't see how I can assist.

19:52.240 --> 19:55.480
Go to the Vicarage at Grantchester.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.400
Ask for Will Davenport.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.920
He'll help you all he can.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.120
You...

20:03.120 --> 20:05.720
don't deserve to be punished.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.280
WILL: It must be difficult.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.520
A woman of your standing
with a son in prison.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.880
Do you think I'm ashamed of him?

20:24.800 --> 20:28.600
I've known since Elroy
was a little boy who he was,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.440
who he'd grow up to be.

20:30.440 --> 20:34.040
I cherished him just the same.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.080
It wasn't him I was ashamed of.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.840
It was everyone else.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.560
This bloody country. Prudes
and hypocrites, the lot of them.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.160
I feel the same, Mrs Hastings.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.640
I really do.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.840
Did Elroy ever mention an inmate,
Joseph Davies?

20:51.840 --> 20:53.400
Is he the one?

20:54.600 --> 20:57.000
At least, that's what
they'd want us to believe.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.040
You think they'd lie?
I'm sure they would.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.240
This information you have...

21:04.240 --> 21:07.040
is it what upset Elroy
when you visited?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.320
A man came to the house.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.080
He was friendly at first.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.720
They always are.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.160
Then he stated his real purpose.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.640
Blackmail.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.000
I let him know in no uncertain terms
to bugger off.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.280
Elroy was furious.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.000
And what would happen
if this man didn't get his money?

21:30.200 --> 21:33.280
He knew people in prison, he said.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.880
He would make sure Elroy suffered.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.320
I should've just damn well paid him.

21:45.080 --> 21:48.360
That man you had a fight with,
he was trying to blackmail you.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.840
They all want money.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.440
And if you didn't pay?

21:53.600 --> 21:55.800
He knew someone in prison, he said.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.520
He'd make sure Leonard would suffer.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.240
It was lies.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.880
It's always lies.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.360
Night, Jonesy.
Night.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.600
Have a pint for me.

CELL DOOR OPENS

22:23.800 --> 22:25.240
DOOR CLANGS SHUT

22:30.000 --> 22:32.040
I met your fella yesterday.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.400
He had a message for you.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.640
Urgh!

22:38.240 --> 22:39.840
HE RETCHES

22:39.840 --> 22:43.440
He wouldn't pay a measly fiver to
make sure that you don't get hurt.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.920
He's washed his hands of you.

22:46.920 --> 22:50.920
All that shame you heaped on him,
all that suffering.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.760
Can you really blame him?

22:52.760 --> 22:55.920
You brought this on yourself,
you know that, don't you?

22:56.880 --> 22:57.960
Yes.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.040
Stand up.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.520
Leonard...

23:06.520 --> 23:08.440
Are you OK?
I thought he was going to kill me!

23:19.400 --> 23:21.480
So, how many inmates
have you threatened?

23:21.480 --> 23:22.680
I, er...

23:23.800 --> 23:25.280
..utilise them.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.000
What, just to make a few quid?
Well, they get what they deserve.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.240
And I get to feed my family.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.280
Leonard deserved to be beaten?

23:36.840 --> 23:38.520
Prisons are there to punish.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.080
WILL: Prisons are.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.600
You aren't.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.240
Most people would agree with
what I do, you know that?

23:45.200 --> 23:46.800
You...

23:46.800 --> 23:48.480
do-gooders...

23:48.480 --> 23:50.440
wringing your hands.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.560
Did you threaten Elroy's mother?

23:56.160 --> 23:58.240
Pansy families are easy money.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.400
Nobody wants that secret coming out.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.360
But she refused to pay.

24:04.240 --> 24:07.000
And she'd told her son
what you'd done.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.920
It needs a guard with a key
to get to the bathroom.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.400
And you were on duty
the night Elroy died.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.760
Did you beat him?
No.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.960
Did you drown him, Mr Lynch?
He was alive when I left him.

24:21.480 --> 24:24.640
If I let Joe Davies out
and another inmate dies...

24:27.160 --> 24:28.720
..that's on your head.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.080
Joe?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.120
Joe...

24:35.120 --> 24:37.640
HE WHIMPERS

24:37.640 --> 24:39.320
Geordie...

24:39.320 --> 24:40.720
Help me get him up.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.040
I think you meant it.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.400
You didn't kill your mother.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.840
Did you?

24:48.360 --> 24:49.800
Geordie...

24:51.040 --> 24:52.480
Geordie, please...

24:53.760 --> 24:56.840
HE WHIMPERS

25:09.720 --> 25:11.440
We have Lynch in custody.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.600
We'll charge him
with Elroy's murder.

25:22.880 --> 25:25.400
If you have anything to say, Joe,
now's the time.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.640
He had no right to hurt you,
Leonard.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.440
Do not let this place destroy you.
Because if you do,

25:47.440 --> 25:50.400
you'll be living this sentence
for the rest of your life.

25:54.360 --> 25:56.960
You're only a prisoner
when you lose hope.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.040
WILL: Joe Davies was just a child
with no history of violence.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.600
It just doesn't add up.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.520
20th October 1950.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.800
An ordinary Friday.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.560
Joe's coming home from school.

26:11.560 --> 26:12.760
It's bath night.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.480
His mother fills the tub...

26:14.480 --> 26:15.920
and then he kills her.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.760
Nothing provoked it.
There was no argument.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.840
He didn't say a word.
He confessed.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.680
Confessions can be coerced.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.400
Will you stop pushing?

26:25.360 --> 26:26.560
Are you all right?

26:27.640 --> 26:29.120
I'm fine.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.480
7:30 at the Vicarage, remember.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.000
I remember.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.520
GEORDIE:
I thought about Burma today.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.480
I mean,
do you ever think about it, Johnny?

26:44.480 --> 26:45.720
No.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.480
The first year home, erm...

27:00.920 --> 27:03.640
..I thought about it
every waking moment.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.360
I didn't even have to close my eyes
and I was back there.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.000
The dark.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.640
The smell.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.720
The walls closing in.

27:33.840 --> 27:39.480
I got to a point where I'd rather
drive my car into a tree than...

27:40.920 --> 27:42.760
..think about it any more.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.360
I swerved at the last moment.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.560
And I was sitting there in my wreck
of a motor and I realised that...

27:59.440 --> 28:02.760
..that I needed to stop remembering.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.120
Apologies.
What for?

28:29.120 --> 28:31.800
It's your study.
Well, it's your study, too.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.040
You'll be joining us this evening,
won't you?

28:34.040 --> 28:36.080
I'd really rather not impose.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.840
Henry...
I want to work.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.280
I'm very happy to work.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.000
Well...

28:41.000 --> 28:42.880
service to the community.

28:42.880 --> 28:46.320
Er, civic duty. At a push,
we could call it discipleship.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.200
There's certainly one person
who could do with some guidance.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.120
I refuse to be outnumbered
by married folk at this thing.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.240
I'm engaged, as it happens.
So, nothing contractual, then.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.000
You're not invited.
Henry's invited.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.200
Henry lives here. You don't.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.240
So, Hen...

29:01.240 --> 29:04.160
Can I call you Hen?
I'd really rather you didn't.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.040
We've got a gate-crasher.
Oh, don't worry.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.640
The more the merrier.

29:22.640 --> 29:24.560
I promise, I am exceedingly merry.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.680
Is she tipsy?
Always.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.760
You look wonderful.
Aw, bless you!

29:30.760 --> 29:33.000
Geordie had better get here quick,
mind.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.680
This corset is liable
to do me a mischief.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.680

of the feminine."

29:37.680 --> 29:40.200
Oh, she's off again.
CATHY CHUCKLES

29:40.200 --> 29:41.600
Oh...

29:41.600 --> 29:43.280
Do you like it?

29:43.280 --> 29:45.320
It's, erm, photos of us
throughout the years.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.240
I, er, made the cover
from my wedding dress.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.440
Oh, it was just mouldering in the
attic. It's silly really, but...

29:53.440 --> 29:54.880
He'll love it.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.520
GEORDIE: It was meeting Cathy.
That's when it all changed.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.640
Ah, she's quite a girl.
Mm.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.120
That woman.
Hm.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.680
That amazing woman.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.520
I envy what you have.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.000
Do you ever remember their names,
the other fellas in the camp?

30:18.960 --> 30:20.240
Er, no.

30:21.600 --> 30:23.160
Sometimes...

30:23.160 --> 30:25.080
I catch a glimpse of their faces.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.400
Wade.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.640
Jacky Wade, was it?

30:30.640 --> 30:32.200
A little fella.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.920
They beat the hell out of him,

30:33.920 --> 30:36.480
but it was dysentery
that got him in the end.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.680
WARDEN: Lights out!

31:01.480 --> 31:03.520

31:13.240 --> 31:15.080

31:15.080 --> 31:16.280
See?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.280
I'll stay awake
until you go to sleep, how's that?

31:20.720 --> 31:23.680
Lynch wasn't the one.
He didn't kill Elroy.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.320
Well, who did?
You can tell me.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.600
Yeah, and who will you tell?

31:26.600 --> 31:28.560
They don't want to hear the truth!
No-one does!

31:28.560 --> 31:30.760
Turn the lights back on!
WARDEN: Hey, keep it down!

31:30.760 --> 31:32.400
Turn the lights back on!

31:32.400 --> 31:34.560
Joe...
No!

31:38.480 --> 31:40.240
I need to speak to the Chaplain!

31:43.640 --> 31:45.560
Hey, hey, hey!

31:45.560 --> 31:47.320
Hey, there he is.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.200
Are you drunk?

31:50.200 --> 31:52.040
Just a tiny, tiny bit.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.800
Oh, God...

31:53.800 --> 31:55.960
Remember, it's a surprise.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.440
Shh... Shh-shh-shh-shh.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.920
I won't tell a soul.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.480
Surprise!

32:09.440 --> 32:10.680
ALL: Happy anniversary!

32:13.040 --> 32:14.320
You lovely lot.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.680
Oops!
Hey...

32:18.680 --> 32:20.880
And Cathy?
She's over there.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.560
Ah...

32:25.840 --> 32:27.680
How many have you had?

32:27.680 --> 32:29.040
Just a...

32:29.040 --> 32:30.280
Right, a toast.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.960
To Cathy.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.040
I met her at a railway station.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.280
You know, you're just as beautiful
now as you were back then.

32:39.280 --> 32:40.320
And...

32:42.720 --> 32:44.240
She saved me.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.840
She doesn't know it, but she did.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.400
She saved me.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
You did, my darling.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Yeah, I met her
at a railway station.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.520
You've already said that Geordie.
Hm?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.080
To Cathy!

33:02.080 --> 33:05.680
Cathy.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.560
How can I help you, Leonard?

33:10.560 --> 33:13.240
If an innocent man
were in this prison...

33:13.240 --> 33:15.640
how would one go about
setting him free?

33:17.520 --> 33:19.600
I take it this isn't
a theoretical question.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.880
Joe wants you
to believe he's not guilty.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.440
You want to believe it, too, because
you'd rather not face up to sin.

33:30.440 --> 33:33.120
Those who can't confront sin
can't hope to be saved.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.680
This is not about sin.
This is about a young man's liberty.

33:36.800 --> 33:38.320
Are you raising your voice to me?

33:39.480 --> 33:40.800
Sorry.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.040
I can count on your help
with communion tomorrow, I take it?

36:18.640 --> 36:20.040

it's not quite the same.

Do you think she'll ever forgive me?
If you're lucky.

You know, if you ever want
to confide in someone...

37:16.840 --> 37:18.560

Oh, I know, you're always fine.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.760
It wasn't that she was angry. It...

37:41.560 --> 37:44.880
It was that she was so responsible.
Comforting the kids and...

37:44.880 --> 37:46.160
and her mum.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.040
She shouldn't have to do that.

Well, I have to say, I'm surprised.
What, Joe drowns his mother,

40:48.720 --> 40:50.320
therefore he must have drowned
Elroy?

40:51.520 --> 40:54.240
The killings were identical.
Only, Joe didn't drown his mother.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.000
Which means Elroy's death
was a set-up.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.160

43:35.640 --> 43:37.160
Come on!

43:37.160 --> 43:40.480
Every time you mess up,
you expect me to forgive you.

43:40.480 --> 43:43.400
You get drunk, you embarrass me,
I forgive you.

43:43.400 --> 43:46.000
You have an affair, I forgive you.
We're back to that, are we?

43:46.000 --> 43:48.320
Yes, we are back to that.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.440
It doesn't just stop,
because you want it to.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.320
I'll go, then, shall I?
Is that what you want?

43:52.320 --> 43:54.840
Oh, I hate it when you're like this.
Don't walk away.

43:54.840 --> 43:56.840
Don't walk away from me!
Go on, then!

44:09.560 --> 44:11.000
All of us...

44:11.000 --> 44:12.200
are flawed.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.520
We all make mistakes.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.760
We here know that
better than anyone.

44:22.040 --> 44:25.520
Others may forgive us our foibles.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.760
Forgiving ourselves...

44:28.760 --> 44:31.240
is ever so much harder.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.120
If we can't absolve ourselves...

44:36.360 --> 44:39.080
..what kind of life
does that leave us?

44:41.320 --> 44:43.560
'One mired in pain...

44:44.960 --> 44:46.720
'..in self-loathing.

44:50.280 --> 44:56.400
'If God can forgive us
our trespasses, we must, too.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.360
'Forgive yourself...

45:19.360 --> 45:22.880
'and let him cleanse you
from your pain.'

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
HE FIGHTS BACK A SOB

46:06.440 --> 46:08.000
