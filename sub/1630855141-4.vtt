WEBVTT

00:07.090 --> 00:08.759
Juliette, get the oxygen.

00:08.759 --> 00:13.055
Okay, stay with us.
Come on. Breathe. Okay.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.681
- Here.
- Got it.

00:14.681 --> 00:15.599
Okay.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.644
Okay, get a pulse.

00:19.686 --> 00:20.938
Count the beats, baby.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.856
- One one thousand, two one thousand...
- Okay.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.857
...three one thousand...

00:23.857 --> 00:26.151
We just need your heart rate to steady.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.986
- ...seven one thousand...
- Pupils are reactive.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.321
Pulse is slowing down.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.826
Okay, focus. Come on.
Focus on me now. What's your name?

00:37.371 --> 00:40.958
Come on, baby. Come on. What's your name?

00:42.167 --> 00:44.044
He's okay. He's coming to.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.420
Hey, what's your name?

00:48.257 --> 00:49.466
Jacob.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.801
That's right.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.885
And who am I?

00:54.012 --> 00:55.514
- Mom.
- Good.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.767
And who's this? What's your sister's name?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.062
Jerk Face.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.441
Hey.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.026
Excuse me, miss?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.655
- Juliette Nichols?
- Yeah.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.074
Thank the Founders.
There's been an accident.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.929
Sam, I hear what you're saying. I do.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.391
We're just asking for a little discretion.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.475
Discretion?

01:40.475 --> 01:42.477
Bernard's not wrong here.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.647
It'll be bad enough
when word gets out she's dead.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.693
Add murder to that and the situation
might become unmanageable.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.570
People of the Silo need comfort.

01:51.570 --> 01:55.407
You know, if it's comfort that you want,

01:56.825 --> 02:02.623
you can get me a focused Judicial list of
every criminal who's ever crossed my path

02:02.623 --> 02:06.001
25 levels either side
of the Mids deputy station.

02:06.835 --> 02:09.338
Fifty levels?
And the point of that would be?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.758
He believes she was poisoned
by someone in the Mids.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.678
It's rat poison. I've seen it before.
You can't taste it or smell it.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.890
Whoever did this did this last night,
when we were at the deputy station.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.683
Somebody broke into the station?

02:22.267 --> 02:27.814
We went for a walk. That's when
the murderer poisoned our bottles.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.692
Bottles? Plural?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.946
When was the last time you walked
the Silo with somebody, Bernie?

02:33.946 --> 02:36.281
That's right,
you don't ever walk the Silo, do you?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.825
What you do is, you drink
from the bottles on each other's backs

02:38.825 --> 02:41.036
'cause it's easier
than trying to reach your own.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.998
And if Ruth's bottle hadn't had that leak,

02:46.333 --> 02:50.128
I'd be lying on that floor too.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.005
You're saying she wasn't the targ--

02:52.881 --> 02:57.177
Don't say "she"!
You don't say "she" about her!

02:57.177 --> 02:58.929
That's Mayor Ruth Jahns!

02:58.929 --> 03:02.349
She carried every level
every election for the past 40 years!

03:02.349 --> 03:04.810
There wasn't a soul
from top to bottom didn't love her.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.062
Everybody she met--

03:08.814 --> 03:11.733
Because I saw-- She was v-- You know.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.282
Fuck.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.160
You'll have the list before daybreak.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.498
We just ask, whatever you do,
you do it quietly.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.626
Miss Nichols.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.756
What the fuck are you doing here?

03:34.756 --> 03:38.051
I had a porter retrieve Miss Nichols,
as she's soon to be our sheriff.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.136
She's not.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.471
Well, she ain't gonna be sheriff
till she's been sworn in.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.390
I'm well aware of that, Deputy.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.767
But considering
the urgency of the situation,

03:45.767 --> 03:47.561
I thought it best that she join us.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.481
Like you would know
what the fuck to do here anyway.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.443
Miss Nichols,
I'm Bernard Holland, the head of IT.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.944
I know who you are.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.156
In accordance with the Pact,
I am now to be Mayor Pro Tem.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.700
At least until elections can be held.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.037
As soon as I'm sworn in,

04:05.037 --> 04:07.748
I'll come up
to swear you into your new role as well.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.882
If you wouldn't mind heading over
to the sheriff's department,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.593
we need to get you up
to speed as soon as possible.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.806
You're gonna have to eat in the cafeteria
or at school today, honey.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.268
I gotta be down in the clinic early again.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.729
Are you gonna fix her chair?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.149
I don't think it's fixable, honey.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.322
I'm gonna need you to do me a favor.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.993
Mom's stuff and Jacob's stuff
are long overdue in Recycling.

06:49.993 --> 06:55.207
If we hang on to it any longer, they'll
come in and we don't want that, right?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.124
No.

06:56.124 --> 07:00.087
After school, you pick up some crates
and pack up their things.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.880
Everything?

07:01.880 --> 07:05.384
Jules, we can't keep things that
could be used by someone else, all right?

07:06.969 --> 07:08.262
Come on, get your bag.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.807
I'll walk you halfway.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.305
Are you Nichols?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
Yeah.

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
Keys are yours.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.457
One opens the main door,
the other this office.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.043
The third, Holston's apartment.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.629
If you know your measurements
and shoe size,

08:23.629 --> 08:26.840
write 'em down, and I'll get you
at least one uniform by tomorrow.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.135
You bleed or sweat through that one,
you'll be wearing it all week,

08:30.135 --> 08:31.970
so try not to get it filthy.

08:33.972 --> 08:34.932
Yeah.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.558
That's Holston's.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.605
Yeah.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.316
You can give it to me.
You'll get yours after you're sworn in.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.401
No, I'll keep it.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.445
Is there any food?

08:49.488 --> 08:50.781
The cafeteria will open at 5:00.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.575
Anything now?

08:53.575 --> 08:55.994
We just grab-and-go three levels down.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.665
I was told to stock
the fridge in the apartment,

08:59.665 --> 09:01.959
but I have no idea
what you people eat down deep.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.297
Children mostly. Sometimes each other.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.513
What's in this?

09:15.973 --> 09:19.351
- Firearms. Restricted items.
- Files?

09:19.351 --> 09:20.727
Some.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.145
And the combination?

09:23.939 --> 09:25.357
After you're sworn in.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.402
Right, listen.
I don't know if your issue is with me

09:28.402 --> 09:30.821
or just with anybody
from the bottom 50, but I'm finding this--

09:30.821 --> 09:32.281
What are the files you want?

09:32.781 --> 09:35.450
- You were asking about files.
- Just one.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.829
George Wilkins. Mechanical.

09:41.498 --> 09:45.669
Look,
I get a note from the mayor that says,

09:46.170 --> 09:48.589
"Clean out Holston's office.
Nichols is coming."

09:50.174 --> 09:52.092
I don't know who you are,
or why you're here--

09:52.092 --> 09:53.969
- You haven't asked.
- I don't give a damn!

09:53.969 --> 09:57.639
The only way I've survived this week is by
following instructions, and I don't need--

09:57.639 --> 10:01.810
I'm Holston's replacement,
which I'm guessing makes me your boss?

10:02.853 --> 10:04.146
Yeah, I'm from the Down Deep.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.149
I eat the same shit you eat.
Maybe with a little bit more salt.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.234
Are we done with that?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.156
Great.
Now, can you please get me Wilkins's file?

10:16.742 --> 10:18.285
Can you get the door on your way out?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.457
Holston always kept it open.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.320
- You doing this all by yourself?
- Yeah.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.449
Hey. Let me see.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.538
You're throwing
too many things down the chute.

13:07.538 --> 13:11.208
Mechanical's complaining again, saying
90% of what you throw away, they fix.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.627
Which is, no doubt, a load of shit,
but I gotta check.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.005
Get it out. Run it again.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.136
So, young lady, is this all your stuff?

13:23.762 --> 13:26.306
My mom's. She doesn't need it anymore.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.225
Is that so?

13:28.225 --> 13:29.726
The other stuff's my brother's.

13:29.726 --> 13:30.811
How old is he?

13:34.523 --> 13:35.649
He was 11.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.405
You can keep some of that stuff
if you want.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.949
These guys,
they're not gonna know what to do with it.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.999
What about your father? He around?

13:52.583 --> 13:53.584
He's working.

13:55.085 --> 13:59.840
You know, you shouldn't be
doing this alone. Not at your age.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.889
Hi, baby.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.017
Juliette.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.103
Goddamn! What the hell are you doing?

14:55.103 --> 14:57.940
- I was hungry, and you weren't home.
- So you start a fire?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.525
I was fixing the chair.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.151
That chair can't be fixed.

15:02.611 --> 15:03.946
It can, and I did.

15:04.988 --> 15:08.200
I also took all of Mom
and Jacob's things down alone!

15:08.867 --> 15:10.118
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.331
- This is the way things are now.
- Because of you!

15:16.124 --> 15:19.169
- No, Jules.
- I shouldn't have to do this!

15:20.420 --> 15:21.630
Neither should I.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.342
What choice do we have?

15:35.519 --> 15:36.603
Jules?

15:37.729 --> 15:38.730
Honey?

15:40.816 --> 15:41.817
Honey!

15:43.735 --> 15:45.779
They're gone, and I can't fix it.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.201
Not everything can be fixed.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.245
Jules?

16:09.178 --> 16:10.554
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:11.138 --> 16:11.972
May I?

16:11.972 --> 16:13.265
Yeah, of course.

16:22.524 --> 16:26.153
I'm sorry. You can sleep with that noise?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.155
Yeah, I can't sleep without it.

16:28.155 --> 16:31.658
Well, if you wanna get it fixed,
I suggest reaching out to maintenance.

16:32.242 --> 16:35.829
They're a particularly territorial bunch
but good at what they do.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.414
I can handle it.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.250
Well, it's your choice.

16:40.250 --> 16:44.630
You'd be making an enemy,
but I'll let you work all of that through.

16:45.214 --> 16:46.924
I am here to swear you in as sheriff.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.886
- With a witness and your uniform.
- Thanks.

16:59.228 --> 17:00.312
What's funny?

17:00.312 --> 17:02.481
Just that you'd be the one swearing me in

17:02.481 --> 17:06.318
when you were the one who accused me
of stealing heat tape, just...

17:14.535 --> 17:15.536
Miss Nichols,

17:17.329 --> 17:18.497
did you steal that tape?

17:20.624 --> 17:22.376
No, I appropriated it 'cause we needed it.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.880
You were not my choice for this position.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.594
But considering recent events,

17:33.303 --> 17:36.306
I think it best we let bygones
be bygones, no?

17:36.306 --> 17:37.391
Of course.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.521
Please place your hand on the Pact
and repeat after me.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.053
I need your signature.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.138
On what?

18:16.972 --> 18:17.973
How's it fit?

18:19.099 --> 18:21.435
Yeah, it's all right. Thanks.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.897
These are the arrangements
for Jahns's funeral.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.983
I'll handle it. You just sign. Here.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.152
Should I read through it or...

18:30.152 --> 18:32.696
You ever made arrangements
for a ceremonial burial?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.115
- No.
- Then that's your answer.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.578
- Is Marnes in?
- Nope.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.959
Judicial says
they don't have a Wilkins file.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.964
Holston did leave a file for you, though.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.509
Well, not for you,
but whoever got the job.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.719
It's right there on top.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.895
<i>Mids to Central.</i>

19:12.528 --> 19:13.862
<i>Mids to Central.</i>

19:15.948 --> 19:17.115
<i>Mids to Cen--</i>

19:19.743 --> 19:20.911
Do you not hear the radio?

19:20.911 --> 19:24.289
- Yeah, I figured you could handle that.
- Look, it's Marnes.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.167
You tell me.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.337
Where'd you get the poison, Franky?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.881
- I don't know. What the fuck?
- Marnes. Hey.

19:32.881 --> 19:33.966
- Let me talk to you.
- No!

19:33.966 --> 19:35.259
Where'd you get the poison, Franky?

19:35.259 --> 19:36.844
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.137
Hey! You've got everyone freaked out.
There are kids watching.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.600
- What the fuck are they doing here?
- Hey.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.728
- You should be in school!
- It's lunch.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.653
- Okay? Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.719
Think there's another way for you to
try and find out what happened to Jahns?

20:18.719 --> 20:22.890
You know, I've worn a badge for over
30 years. You've been sheriff half a day.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.309
There's not a thing you can tell me
about how to do this job.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.770
You know I didn't ask
for the badge, right?

20:28.770 --> 20:30.439
Why'd you change your mind?

20:34.693 --> 20:36.570
I didn't know Holston
as well as you did, but--

20:36.570 --> 20:38.113
That's the understatement of the century.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.282
I figured if he wanted me to have it,
I should take it.

20:40.991 --> 20:41.950
That's bullshit.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.286
What'd you do to him down there?
What did you say?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.288
- What'd I do to him?
- Yeah, what did you say to him?

20:48.749 --> 20:51.084
The guy you beat up, Franky,
what's his story?

20:53.462 --> 20:56.924
A year ago, Franky poisoned two levels
with bad booze.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.510
- Bad booze isn't rat poison.
- It's poison.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.764
Am I the only one in the Silo who gives
a fuck about finding out the truth?

21:04.765 --> 21:05.766
No, you're not.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.394
- You wanna know what I said to Holston?
- Yeah, I do.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.273
I said he should've listened to his wife

21:13.774 --> 21:16.401
'cause if he had,
maybe she'd be alive right now.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.528
You did what?

21:18.237 --> 21:22.074
I told him someone had been murdered.
I proved it to him.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.201
Knowing that was a possibility,

21:24.201 --> 21:26.870
he said he'd still have to tell Judicial
it was an accident.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.374
He was gonna send a sign
if he found anything, so I waited.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.585
Next time I see Sheriff Holston
is with the rest of the Silo,

21:33.585 --> 21:35.462
when he goes out to clean.

21:35.462 --> 21:39.967
Then the mayor gives me this.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.148
"Truth."

21:59.987 --> 22:01.154
You think that's the sign?

22:01.738 --> 22:02.739
I don't know.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.952
And that's why you
want George Wilkins's file.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.539
Sandy told me.
Boy, she really doesn't like you.

22:11.123 --> 22:12.791
Yeah, she's not subtle about it.

22:15.794 --> 22:16.962
What do you want from me?

22:18.422 --> 22:20.591
I want you to help me
to find out who killed George.

22:21.758 --> 22:22.968
Why should I do that?

22:22.968 --> 22:25.220
I'll help you figure out
what happened to the mayor.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.119
You have to stand that far back?

22:49.119 --> 22:52.080
If I hadn't moved my head last time,
I'd be wearing an eye patch.

22:53.582 --> 22:55.834
The fuck are you doing here, Marnes?

22:58.378 --> 23:02.341
- Hello, Patrick. The sheriff and I--
- Wait, who's this?

23:02.925 --> 23:05.427
That's right. The new sheriff.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.596
'Cause your old pal's outside,
cuddled with his lady.

23:08.305 --> 23:11.767
Hey, Patrick Kennedy.
We are here to talk to your wife.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.393
Right?

23:15.020 --> 23:16.688
- Is that funny to you?
- Yeah.

23:17.898 --> 23:22.069
- Go ahead, knock. Should be interesting.
- Why is that?

23:22.069 --> 23:23.320
Couple of reasons, Marnes.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.280
One of which being
that she's been dead for a year.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.033
Surprised you didn't come to the funeral,

23:28.033 --> 23:30.786
seeing as you framing her
is the reason why she's in the soil.

23:33.539 --> 23:37.668
Yeah, Patrick. We all knew she was headed
for the farm the minute she met you.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.002
Hey.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.003
Son of a--

23:49.221 --> 23:50.639
Ouch!

23:55.310 --> 23:58.647
I'm gonna have to follow up
on this Patrick Kennedy, am I?

23:58.647 --> 23:59.982
'Cause he broke your nose?

23:59.982 --> 24:04.611
No, because of robbery and extortion,
and a past jam with Judicial over relics.

24:07.447 --> 24:12.828
You ever see a hard drive
in Holston's safe or his apartment?

24:14.538 --> 24:15.706
Check Recycling.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.001
Any hard drive
or personal effects of Holston's

24:19.001 --> 24:21.086
would've gone there
after he went out to clean.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.588
Right.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.799
You looking
for some kind of sign of Holston's

24:25.799 --> 24:29.720
on this drive that'll lead you
to the truth about George Wilkins?

24:30.220 --> 24:31.972
And what if you don't find it?

24:33.557 --> 24:34.558
I gotta try.

24:39.479 --> 24:44.401
Truth and trying mattered to Allison too,
and it mattered to Holston.

24:44.401 --> 24:47.196
And you might wanna think about that.

24:48.363 --> 24:51.158
Hey, with Jahns,
how do you know you were the target?

24:51.158 --> 24:55.621
Forty years as mayor, and what?
She didn't piss off one person?

24:55.621 --> 24:56.788
Not as many as me.

24:57.456 --> 25:00.584
Just-- Listen, down in Mechanical,

25:00.584 --> 25:03.712
someone's always got a theory
about why a machine breaks.

25:04.213 --> 25:07.382
I deal with facts.
Jahns, she was poisoned which means--

25:07.382 --> 25:11.136
Jahns was not a machine. She was a person...

25:13.597 --> 25:14.890
like no other person.

25:39.081 --> 25:40.457
How about that deal?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.418
You help me, I'll help you.

25:44.545 --> 25:46.380
And then I can head back to Mechanical.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.799
You can get someone else to do this job,

25:48.799 --> 25:53.178
while you live the rest of your life
in peace.

25:56.390 --> 25:57.516
Wanna think about it?

25:58.851 --> 26:03.313
In the meantime,
try not kicking down any more doors.

26:04.606 --> 26:05.732
Yeah. All right.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.612
Should we get a deputy outside?

26:10.612 --> 26:12.614
You pissed off a lot
of people today, Marnes.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.324
I got a shotgun.

26:17.327 --> 26:21.665
You know, there are some things
a shotgun isn't the best solution for.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.087
I'll be fine.

27:29.733 --> 27:30.859
Good morning.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.033
<i>"Dear Miss Walker,</i>

27:38.033 --> 27:42.704
<i>I'm writing to you to introduce you
to my daughter, Juliette Nichols."</i>

27:43.914 --> 27:45.582
Juliette Nichols?

27:45.582 --> 27:46.667
Yes, ma'am.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.378
Hell kind of name is Juliette?

27:50.379 --> 27:51.421
It's from a play.

27:53.257 --> 27:57.427
"I would like her to shadow in Mechanical.
Signed, Doctor Peter Nichols."

27:57.427 --> 27:59.805
- That's my father.
- Yeah, I figured.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.474
You didn't want to shadow him?

28:03.016 --> 28:04.685
Sight of blood makes me queasy.

28:04.685 --> 28:05.978
Plenty of blood down here.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.524
You related to Hanna Nichols?

28:10.524 --> 28:12.150
Yeah. She was my mother.

28:13.861 --> 28:16.113
We don't get many visits
from where you're from.

28:16.822 --> 28:20.784
Certainly not from kids
with notes from doctor daddies.

28:21.952 --> 28:24.705
- What good are you to us?
- I can fix things.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.666
- My mom taught me to fix things.
- This ain't a toy shop, kid.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.586
If that's all you got,
I think I gotta send you back.

28:30.586 --> 28:31.753
I'm not going back.

28:32.713 --> 28:36.508
Well, listen to me, little fixer.
This isn't the place for you.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.760
Down here, mistakes cost lives.

28:38.760 --> 28:41.680
While you learn on the job,
you put lives in danger.

28:41.680 --> 28:42.764
So, how'd they learn?

28:43.265 --> 28:46.101
- Family. They were born into it.
- So was I.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.396
You are your mother's daughter all right.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.482
Hey, Knox?

28:53.192 --> 28:54.193
Knox?

28:55.694 --> 29:00.032
Tell Shirley to take this
Juliette character to the scavenge team.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.841
- They've got five minutes.
- This is crazy.

29:18.509 --> 29:21.512
The 12 Recycling stations are all
on different schedules,

29:21.512 --> 29:23.889
dumping once,
at an exact time, every hour.

29:23.889 --> 29:27.518
But it times out so that every
five minutes something else falls.

29:27.518 --> 29:30.354
They're supposed to only dump
stuff they can't reuse or fix.

29:30.354 --> 29:32.397
But they get lazy,
so we find things we can repair

29:32.397 --> 29:34.441
and send back up
or use down here ourselves.

29:34.942 --> 29:35.943
Who'd want that job?

29:36.735 --> 29:38.028
No one. They're criminals.

29:38.028 --> 29:39.071
What did they do?

29:39.071 --> 29:41.114
They killed, like, a dozen people.

29:43.909 --> 29:45.577
They stole something or beat somebody.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.372
I have no idea. But stuff falls.
They drag it.

29:48.372 --> 29:50.499
We sort it and fix what we can
in the next room.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.544
The stuff that we don't use goes
to the incinerator.

29:53.544 --> 29:55.712
Primo parts go to Walker. She has a list.

29:55.712 --> 29:58.298
Find something on it,
you take it to her directly.

29:58.298 --> 29:59.883
She never leaves her shop. Ever.

30:00.968 --> 30:04.304
<i>It's about time
someone from the Down Deep rose up.</i>

30:05.013 --> 30:09.685
Gives all us bottom-siders hope
things might get better around here.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.062
What can I do for ya?

30:13.313 --> 30:15.607
I'm looking for something
that might've come in

30:15.607 --> 30:17.943
from the cleanout
of Sheriff Holston's apartment.

30:19.862 --> 30:23.740
I was on that cleanout.
A lot of tears that day.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.368
What in particular are you looking for?

30:26.368 --> 30:31.206
A metal box about this big.
Could be a hard drive.

30:31.206 --> 30:35.627
I'm also looking for about ten sheets
of paper, typescript with handwriting.

30:36.128 --> 30:37.588
That much paper, I'd remember.

30:38.088 --> 30:41.133
But,
I don't recall seeing anything like that.

30:41.633 --> 30:42.759
- I'll ask the others.
- No.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.887
Just message me directly
if anything turns up.

30:44.887 --> 30:47.139
- I'll cover the charge.
- You got it.

30:47.139 --> 30:48.390
Okay.

31:14.666 --> 31:15.876
You wanted to see me?

31:16.752 --> 31:17.753
Hey, Jules.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.339
Come in. Shut the door.

31:28.138 --> 31:30.766
When you forge a letter,
you should check the spelling.

31:31.350 --> 31:33.393
Mechanical has an H in it.

31:34.895 --> 31:36.063
Morning after you arrived,

31:36.063 --> 31:38.357
I sent a porter to tell your dad
you were down here,

31:38.357 --> 31:40.400
so he wouldn't spend
the rest of his life wondering

31:40.400 --> 31:42.319
if you'd fallen down the trash chute.

31:42.319 --> 31:43.987
I'm not going back up.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.822
Well,
you don't get to decide those things.

31:45.822 --> 31:46.990
Not at 13.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.001
Are you happy here?

32:02.422 --> 32:05.884
I start work hours
before the lights cycle to day.

32:06.802 --> 32:07.886
I eat lunch standing up.

32:07.886 --> 32:09.805
And if I'm lucky,
I get a half-an-hour break.

32:11.265 --> 32:12.558
Every night, I am exhausted.

32:14.309 --> 32:16.144
I fall asleep before my head hits the cot.

32:18.564 --> 32:20.607
Are you happy, Juliette?

32:23.026 --> 32:25.946
I'm happy I really don't have time
to think about Mom or Jacob.

32:29.950 --> 32:30.951
Or me?

32:35.205 --> 32:36.623
Yeah, you shouldn't have to.

32:42.713 --> 32:45.382
Mechanical doesn't need anyone
looking for an escape.

32:46.091 --> 32:47.759
Mechanical needs workers,

32:47.759 --> 32:51.263
people committed to ensuring
the lives of others.

32:51.263 --> 32:53.182
Everyone in the Silo relies on us.

32:53.182 --> 32:54.850
So, if you can't commit to that,

32:55.601 --> 32:57.978
I don't care where you go
'cause you're not needed here.

32:57.978 --> 33:00.063
- But I am.
- You are what?

33:00.063 --> 33:02.232
Needed here. I'm good at this.

33:15.704 --> 33:16.705
All right.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.627
From now on, you shadow Knox.

33:23.170 --> 33:24.171
Yes, ma'am.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.063
Who is it?

34:24.648 --> 34:25.649
It's Rob.

34:27.568 --> 34:28.569
Hang on.

34:35.409 --> 34:37.995
Wow. Love the new look, buddy.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.371
Fuck you very much.

34:39.371 --> 34:40.998
Your new boss give you that?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.460
I got it from a guy named Patrick Kennedy.
Remember him?

34:45.960 --> 34:47.670
Sold unsanctioned relics.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.505
He also committed a string of felonies.

34:49.505 --> 34:50.674
Why'd he hit you?

34:51.175 --> 34:53.510
Besides the fact
that you generally kinda invite it.

34:54.261 --> 34:56.096
I went to visit his wife, Doris.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.057
She'd threatened me a few times
and meant it.

34:59.558 --> 35:05.022
But fortunately for the Silo,
dear darling Doris is dead.

35:05.022 --> 35:08.025
A fact that didn't end up
in that list that you gave me.

35:08.609 --> 35:09.818
You know what they say, Sam?

35:09.818 --> 35:12.446
You wanna lose something forever,
give it to Data Management.

35:14.406 --> 35:17.534
I forget how much people don't like you.
Who's watching your back?

35:18.035 --> 35:19.244
Are you volunteering?

35:21.830 --> 35:23.123
I have good news.

35:24.249 --> 35:27.085
Judge Meadows is ready
to make the new sheriff a former one.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.170
Paperwork's done.

35:28.170 --> 35:31.048
You sign along with Mayor Pencilneck,
and by morning,

35:31.048 --> 35:34.051
Billings will be Up Top and ready
to take over the job.

35:35.719 --> 35:40.140
Yeah, well, I figure we'd better hold off
on that a bit.

35:40.891 --> 35:41.892
Why is that?

35:43.268 --> 35:44.978
Nichols was Holston's choice.

35:44.978 --> 35:47.272
I figure she's got a right
to fail on her own.

35:48.440 --> 35:52.361
She knows she's not wanted.
She's not gonna last long.

35:54.279 --> 35:55.489
Send her back down mad.

35:55.489 --> 35:58.158
She's just gonna get
Mechanical all riled up and...

35:59.326 --> 36:03.580
It's your call, but Meadows
wants Nichols out and Billings in.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.749
And you know when something
sticks in her craw, well--

36:05.749 --> 36:07.167
Well, I don't work for Meadows.

36:08.919 --> 36:11.088
But we all work for the good of the Silo.

36:13.006 --> 36:15.050
You're right. For the good of the Silo.

36:29.898 --> 36:33.694
Technically, I still have one minute left
before the cafeteria closes.

36:35.153 --> 36:36.154
Okay.

36:37.239 --> 36:39.908
Sheriff, sorry, Sheriff.

36:42.286 --> 36:43.453
Lukas.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.665
- Juliette.
- Juliette?

36:47.499 --> 36:48.667
Like the play.

36:49.793 --> 36:52.671
- Yeah. You heard of it?
- Yeah, of course.

36:52.671 --> 36:56.049
Well, they don't really perform that one
anymore though, do they?

36:57.801 --> 36:59.303
I don't know.

36:59.887 --> 37:03.682
Some people say it was written by,
well, a rebel.

37:06.852 --> 37:08.979
Did I just say something
that you could arrest me for?

37:10.689 --> 37:11.690
I wouldn't know.

37:13.317 --> 37:16.820
Okay. Well,
maybe I should just go back and get my--

37:16.820 --> 37:19.990
Yeah, I think your minute's up, so...

37:21.867 --> 37:22.701
Okay.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.788
- Good night.
- Night.

38:11.708 --> 38:13.085
<i>You'd consider retiring?</i>

38:16.088 --> 38:17.089
Why not?

38:18.048 --> 38:20.342
Maybe open a shop

38:21.927 --> 38:24.221
right next to some guy who does drawings.

38:28.725 --> 38:31.520
<i>You know, I didn't come
all this way just to meet Nichols.</i>

38:33.814 --> 38:36.275
I wanted to spend time with you.

38:41.280 --> 38:47.077
And their great victory
should be celebrated with horns.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.301
<i>Walk?</i>

39:06.221 --> 39:07.514
<i>Walker, you there?</i>

39:13.562 --> 39:15.564
- That you, Fixer?
- Yeah.

39:15.564 --> 39:17.691
Hey. I'm here.

39:19.902 --> 39:21.028
<i>How goes the work?</i>

39:24.698 --> 39:26.742
Well, I might not be pulling alone.

39:30.329 --> 39:32.080
<i>So, progress?</i>

39:35.292 --> 39:36.710
Yeah, maybe.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.545
<i>Did you find an ally?</i>

39:42.216 --> 39:43.217
<i>Perhaps.</i>

39:46.595 --> 39:47.721
I'll know more tomorrow.

39:49.097 --> 39:50.933
<i>There's been some progress here too.</i>

39:51.975 --> 39:54.770
In fact,
something that may require your insight.

39:56.104 --> 39:58.315
Okay, give me a bit,
and I'll see what I can do.

39:58.815 --> 40:00.526
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

40:03.070 --> 40:04.071
<i>Night.</i>

40:06.240 --> 40:07.407
<i>Okay. Good night.</i>

42:45.232 --> 42:46.483
Oh, fuck.
