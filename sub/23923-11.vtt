WEBVTT

00:00.835 --> 00:03.435
[opening theme music playing]

00:33.434 --> 00:34.666
[deezy] I just wanna
welcome everyone

00:34.668 --> 00:36.902
to the official
housewarming party.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.804
I finally got my place
looking the way I wanted.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.773
So, um...
Cheers, team.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.675
[marquess] cheers.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.145
Eh... Hmm.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.380
Mmm. Huh?

00:50.985 --> 00:52.951
This is fun.

00:52.953 --> 00:56.455
Ah.

00:56.457 --> 01:00.759
Oh, the candles
are a nice touch.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.995
Well, there's no
electricity out here,
no running water.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.997
You got running water.
The pool.

01:04.999 --> 01:06.498
Oh, that's true.
I'm not complaining.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.233
I got the pool.
I bathe in the pool.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.702
Attitude of gratitude.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.671
Hey, anyone care for one
of these pigs in a blanket?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.506
I don't know.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.341
Do any not have
bird shit all over them?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.777
[bleep] you, pigeon.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.713
Oh, good.
Looks like we got a mystery.

01:21.715 --> 01:23.916
Hopefully it's time sensitive
so we can get the [bleep]
out of here.

01:23.918 --> 01:26.151
"dear mike tyson mystery team.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.821
My husband and I
had dinner at our friends,
the stevensons.

01:28.823 --> 01:31.156
Naturally, we sent them
a thank you card.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.724
But now they've
sent us flowers,

01:32.726 --> 01:34.893
thanking us for
the thank you card.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.695
Are we supposed to send
another thank you card?

01:36.697 --> 01:38.397
Obviously this isn't
an emergency,

01:38.399 --> 01:40.499
but we'd love your help.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.568
Warmly,
shelley and phil holbrook."

01:42.570 --> 01:44.369
ooh, that sounds like
an emergency.

01:44.371 --> 01:45.804
I'm sorry, deezy,
we gotta go.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.308
I just wanna thank
everyone for coming

01:49.310 --> 01:50.776
to my beautiful home,
which I would not have

01:50.778 --> 01:52.544
if it weren't for
your generosity, mike.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.613
Truly, without this place,
I would be homeless.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.115
Yeah. Come on,
let's go.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.383
[pigeon] watch it!
[screams]

01:58.385 --> 02:00.419
oh, my god! It's on fire!
Open the [bleep] door!

02:00.421 --> 02:02.888
[shudders] it's locked!

02:02.890 --> 02:04.756
I didn't want nobody
to leave early,
so I locked it.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.925
[all screaming]

02:14.401 --> 02:16.535
good party, deezy.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.541
Pig in a blanket?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.076
Don't mind
if I do.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.211
Mmm.
These are beautiful.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.880
Is this the bouquet
they sent you?

02:27.882 --> 02:31.016
This is the $100 bouquet
the stevensons sent us.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.784
We looked it up
online.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.052
Wow, that's nice.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.854
It's extravagant!

02:35.856 --> 02:37.956
And unnecessary.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.459
Who gives a thank you gift
for a thank you card?

02:40.461 --> 02:42.427
Now what are we
supposed to do?

02:42.429 --> 02:44.429
Wait, so your...
So your problem is deciding

02:44.431 --> 02:45.898
whether or not you have to now
give something

02:45.900 --> 02:47.166
in return for the flowers?

02:47.168 --> 02:49.635
Yes!

02:49.637 --> 02:51.003
The stevensons have put us
in an awful position.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.105
It's truly untenable.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.140
White people problems.

02:55.142 --> 02:58.277
The most fascinating
problems of all.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.978
I myself would not have
given a shit.

02:59.980 --> 03:02.681
But you are the client,

03:02.683 --> 03:06.318
and therefore we will
pretend like this
is a real problem.

03:06.320 --> 03:09.721
May I have another
little hotdog in a towel?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.290
None of this
would have happened

03:11.292 --> 03:13.025
if we'd just done
what I said.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.060
-But shelley...
-It's true.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.396
I said we should have
been the ones to send flowers.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.131
That would have
been overkill.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.566
A card was
absolutely appropriate.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.634
Well, obviously it wasn't,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.269
because they sent us flowers
to make a point.

03:24.271 --> 03:25.370
They're [bleep]
with us.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.272
[gasps]

03:27.274 --> 03:29.374
oh!

03:29.376 --> 03:31.276
I'm sorry.

03:31.278 --> 03:33.412
This is just
all very stressful.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.180
Well, what about getting
them a bottle of wine?

03:35.182 --> 03:36.615
[marquess]
ah, I love that.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.383
Wine is perfect.
That should end this.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.985
And you don't have
to go crazy.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.521
Just do like $20 to $30
pinot, or cab, or zin.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.490
-Oh. Hmm.
-Oh.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.659
We can't thank you enough.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.828
Just send us
a thank you card,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.097
and we'll send you
some flowers,

03:52.099 --> 03:54.700
and then you'll send us
a nice pinot, or cab, or zin.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.440
[deezy] I wanna thank
everyone for coming
to my grand reopening,

04:01.442 --> 04:03.675
a.K.A.
Housewarming party two.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.210
It took a lot of blood,
sweat and tears to rebuild.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.379
Literally.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.982
I cut myself many times,
and I cried every night.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.650
And as you remarked about
the body odor smell when
you came in here, mike,

04:11.652 --> 04:13.852
I also sweat a lot.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.955
But I did it, and now I have
a roof over my head.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.057
Again.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.260
[marquess]
oh, thank god.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.762
"dear mike tyson
mystery team,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.564
the situation with
the stevensons has gone
from bad to worse.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.366
Please hurry.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.835
Warmly,
shelley and phil holbrook."

04:29.837 --> 04:32.671
well, deezy, as they say,
all good things must
come to an end.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.340
Or bad things.
Like this party.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.742
Oh, I got that locked.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.444
Let me get that for you.
Pardon me.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.146
Ooh! What's the smell?

04:41.148 --> 04:43.348
Oh, that's me.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.750
I gotta get in that pool
and take a shower.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.023
This is such a mess.
Such an absolute mess.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.624
We are going crazy here.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.159
We want off
this rollercoaster!

04:54.161 --> 04:56.094
Okay. Okay.
Now, look.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.730
Take a deep breath
and tell us what happened.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.566
We sent them
a bottle of wine,
and they hated it.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.769
Now, shelley,
we don't know that.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.971
We never heard from them.
We sent it two weeks ago...

05:05.973 --> 05:07.973
And we never got
a thank you letter.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.275
I thought you didn't
want a thank you letter?

05:10.277 --> 05:12.744
We didn't want
a thank you letter
thanking us for the wine.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.479
We just wanted
some acknowledgement

05:14.481 --> 05:16.448
that they'd received it.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.183
Because for all we know
it got lost in the mail.

05:18.185 --> 05:21.086
But either way,
it's a disaster.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.788
Either they never got it
and they think we're
ungrateful for the flowers,

05:22.790 --> 05:25.090
or they did get it,
and they think

05:25.092 --> 05:26.858
it wasn't enough of a thank you
for the flowers.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.161
Oh, god.
Phil, we are [bleep].

05:29.163 --> 05:30.562
-[both gasp]
-shelley.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.397
[sobs] oh, god.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.667
I'm sorry. [sobbing]

05:35.669 --> 05:38.537
I mean, I have known
white people my whole life,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.806
and I'm no closer
to understanding them.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.741
They are truly fascinating.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.609
Michael.
How can we help you?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.611
Murder phil and shelley?

05:46.613 --> 05:48.814
Ha ha!
Oh. I'm sorry.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.450
I thought you were asking
how you can help me.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.951
Would you go over
to the stevensons

05:52.953 --> 05:54.686
and find out
if they got the wine

05:54.688 --> 05:56.688
and how they
feel about us?

06:01.362 --> 06:03.562
[woman]
it's a bedside valet

06:03.564 --> 06:06.365
for your cufflinks and
your bits and baubles.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.534
It's cute,
but it's a bit personal.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.269
Not that I don't love it,
because I do love it,

06:11.271 --> 06:12.504
and I'm gonna
get it for myself.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.406
[chuckles]

06:14.408 --> 06:16.541
hold on.
Don't move.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.410
I have something
in the back.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.179
What are we doing here?

06:21.181 --> 06:23.115
Well, we can't just
go over to the stevensons
empty handed.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.750
That's rude!

06:24.752 --> 06:25.784
We need to bring
a little something.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.419
Not too much of a thing,

06:27.421 --> 06:28.954
because we don't even
know them.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.656
But we definitely have
to bring something.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.592
Ah, I think
I'm starting to get it.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.427
White people don't
have any problems,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.195
so they have
to create problems.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.531
What about this pair

06:39.533 --> 06:43.535
of vintage italian
ceramic roosters?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.337
[gasps dramatically]

06:50.077 --> 06:51.610
of course
we received the wine,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.712
and we threw it
in the trash.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.014
Oh, my god! Just when I think
I'm starting to get it.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.682
Why would you
throw it away?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.418
Because it was
a slap in the face.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.886
It was designed
to injure.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.854
That wine was
meant to ridicule us.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.523
The night we had
them for dinner,

07:04.525 --> 07:06.625
kip had
a little too much to drink.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.860
Goddamn it, alicia.
I had three glasses of wine.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.464
I can't have three glasses
of wine in my own home?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.599
I have
a very stressful job.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.435
Kip is a financial advisor

07:16.437 --> 07:19.838
for a major fortune 500
company.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.307
With all due respect, they
actually sent you the wine

07:22.309 --> 07:24.443
to thank you
for the flowers.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.411
Why would they thank us
for the flowers?

07:26.413 --> 07:28.013
The flowers were a thank you
for their thank you card.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.581
It was over.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.316
No, they had to
get their dig in.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.119
I drink because I like it,
not because I have to.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.521
Well, now the ball
is in our court.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.323
Perhaps we could send them
a gift card to williams sonoma?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.891
Yes, that's perfect.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.093
That's just what
those [bleep] deserve.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.762
[gasps]

07:43.764 --> 07:45.697
wait, now I'm bewildered.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.699
Why would you send
shelley and phil

07:47.701 --> 07:50.068
a williams sonoma gift card
if you're mad at them?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.170
Because they're
not well off.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.572
And they'll be
reminded of that fact

07:53.574 --> 07:55.707
when they use our gift card

07:55.709 --> 07:57.409
to get something they couldn't
afford on their own.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.045
[mike] what?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.681
I think the four of you
need to get together
and talk.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.883
I think this is all
just a big misunderstanding.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.685
Well, I'm not setting foot
in their house

08:06.687 --> 08:08.086
and they certainly aren't
welcome in ours.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.590
[bottle breaking]
gah! It broke.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.158
It slipped out
of my hand.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.926
Something must be
wrong with this glass.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.628
It's not because
I'm drunk.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.830
Stop staring at me.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.066
You're all making a scene.
All of you!

08:28.775 --> 08:30.842
Oh, thank you,
marquess.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.980
It's not for you, michael.
It's for our guests.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.715
Wait, who are
our guests?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.683
The stevensons
and the holbrooks.

08:38.685 --> 08:39.918
We thought they should
meet somewhere neutral,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.620
so we offered our house.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.421
[car doors shutting]

08:49.296 --> 08:51.396
oh, god. Why do they have
those gift bags?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.298
[marquess] huh?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.799
Well, I'm sure
they're bringing you a gift.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.268
It's their first time
in your home.

08:56.270 --> 08:57.736
It's what you do.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.070
Oh, no!
If they give me something,

08:59.072 --> 09:00.405
then I have to
give them something.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.007
We'll all be embroiled
in it.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.775
I can't be embroiled
in this, marquess.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.577
[doorbell ringing]

09:05.579 --> 09:07.345
well, then what are we
supposed to do?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.813
We invited them here.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.221
Isn't there any other
place they can go?

09:20.494 --> 09:22.527
Ooh! A scented candle!

09:22.529 --> 09:24.462
You shouldn't have.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.565
Well, thank you for
having us into your home.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.199
Oh, damn!
A 14 year old scotch?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.235
Very nice.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.736
That's several more years
than I'm used to.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.239
Think nothing of it.
It's what you do.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.840
[man on tv]
<i> you'd really think</i>
<i> they gotta go for it here.</i>

09:35.842 --> 09:38.810
<i> They've been running...</i>

09:38.812 --> 09:40.679
Deezy, how do they seem?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.180
Real good. Real good.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.716
They seem to be
getting along real good.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.918
I lit a candle,
poured them a little scotch,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.321
and now they're just chilling,
just reconciling.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.956
And just to make sure that
no one leaves until they do,

09:50.958 --> 09:52.891
I locked that door.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.626
[shelley] kip,
I think you've had enough.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.361
[kip] shut up.
You're not my wife.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.296
[phil] don't tell my wife
to shut up.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.131
[kip] don't talk to me!
You're poor!

10:00.133 --> 10:01.700

10:01.702 --> 10:03.101
[all grunting, clamoring]

10:03.103 --> 10:04.469
[alicia] you're stepping
on my dress.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.837
Kip, let's get
out of here.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.606
-[kip] damn you!
-[alicia] open the door!

10:07.608 --> 10:09.240
Open the door!

10:09.242 --> 10:11.910
[all screaming]

10:17.684 --> 10:19.918
now, tell me this.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.486
Do you think I need
to give these people a gift

10:21.488 --> 10:23.788
because they gave me a gift?

10:23.790 --> 10:27.158
I think you're good.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.894
