WEBVTT

00:03.316 --> 00:05.740
I really made my bones with
that last collar, babe.

00:06.055 --> 00:07.160
Today's the day.

00:07.194 --> 00:09.228
You woke up with
a guard this morning.

00:09.263 --> 00:13.483
But tonight, you're going
to bed with a detective.

00:13.517 --> 00:18.070
Shh...Okay, you get
some rest, 'kay?

00:18.105 --> 00:20.640
Probably need it.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

00:30.183 --> 00:32.017
Here's Ben dressed
like a dragon.

00:32.034 --> 00:33.536
Aww.

00:33.570 --> 00:36.322
Here's me and Abed dressed
as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy.

00:36.356 --> 00:37.723
Aww.

00:37.758 --> 00:39.024
Who's Nick Nolte?

00:39.042 --> 00:40.827
Aww.

00:40.861 --> 00:42.862
Hey, Abed, can I borrow some
change for the water fountain?

00:42.896 --> 00:44.080
Yeah. Here you go.

00:44.131 --> 00:47.834
- Thank you.
- Wait. Change?

00:47.868 --> 00:49.702
- Hey, Dean.
- Hmm?

00:49.736 --> 00:50.887
What are you doing?

00:50.921 --> 00:52.221
Nothing after lunch.

00:52.256 --> 00:55.708
And I can skip lunch
if you want-- Oh. That.

00:55.742 --> 00:58.427
Keeps tuition down
and it saves on water, too.

00:58.478 --> 00:59.912
That's because nobody's
gonna pay to drink water.

00:59.947 --> 01:01.681
Actually it's a two
drink-minimum.

01:01.715 --> 01:03.566
It'll be reflected
in your tuition.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.601
Hey, Dean.
Thanks for the new digs.

01:05.652 --> 01:08.387
Ah, eh, remember
what we talked about?

01:08.405 --> 01:11.240
We have to keep this whole
living situation kind of quiet.

01:11.275 --> 01:13.192
You know, on the d-low.

01:13.226 --> 01:14.861
Sure, you know,
I'm barely there.

01:14.895 --> 01:16.746
I'm married to the job.

01:16.780 --> 01:19.115
And to a mannequin leg
I found in the boiler room.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.066
Homewrecker.

01:21.084 --> 01:22.468
Your first major lab assignment

01:22.502 --> 01:23.803
is to construct a terrarium.

01:23.837 --> 01:26.906
Sort of like a diorama.

01:26.940 --> 01:30.776
You guys have
weird reactions to stuff.

01:30.811 --> 01:32.578
Hey, can I ask you something?

01:32.613 --> 01:34.647
This is unrelated.

01:34.681 --> 01:36.382
As someone who just finished
spending the majority

01:36.416 --> 01:37.650
of his life in prison,

01:37.684 --> 01:41.554
what happened with legos?
They used to be simple.

01:41.588 --> 01:43.556
Oh, come on, I know you know
what I'm talking about.

01:43.590 --> 01:46.559
Legos were simple.

01:48.562 --> 01:50.696
Something happened out here
while I was inside.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.933
Harry Potter legos,
Star Wars legos.

01:53.967 --> 01:55.735
Complicated kits,

01:55.769 --> 01:58.871
tiny little blocks.

01:58.906 --> 02:02.842
I mean, I'm not saying it's bad,
I just wanna know what happened.

02:02.876 --> 02:04.243
All right, fine.

02:04.278 --> 02:06.329
Your terrariums are due
tomorrow.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.214
And everyone look across
the table

02:08.247 --> 02:10.015
at the person in front of you.

02:10.050 --> 02:13.002
That's your lab partner
for the rest of the semester.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.287
Saddle up.

02:15.305 --> 02:18.124
Who are these people?

02:48.321 --> 02:49.689
Yes?

02:49.723 --> 02:51.724
I know you haven't been here
at Greendale very long,

02:51.758 --> 02:54.293
but, um...We're a study group.

02:54.328 --> 02:55.728
It's kind of a thing.
We've been through a lot.

02:55.762 --> 02:56.963
You probably heard
of the space bus.

02:56.997 --> 02:58.397
Paintball.

02:58.432 --> 03:00.599
I had sex with Eartha Kitt
in an airplane bathroom,

03:00.634 --> 03:02.501
and these are the only guys
I've ever told.

03:02.519 --> 03:03.886
Yeah, we're like a family.

03:03.937 --> 03:05.304
We love each other.
Second paintball.

03:05.339 --> 03:07.506
What is happening
at this school?

03:07.541 --> 03:09.809
I have so many conversations
that make no sense.

03:09.843 --> 03:12.845
Uh, we'd really prefer
to partner up amongst ourselves.

03:12.863 --> 03:15.197
I don't care.
Go ahead.

03:17.851 --> 03:19.719
It's not you, it's me.

03:19.753 --> 03:20.853
I'm just trying
to protect us both

03:20.871 --> 03:22.621
from more pain down the road.

03:22.656 --> 03:24.040
I may have
a developmental disorder.

03:24.074 --> 03:26.876
I need to catch up
on Breaking Bad, so...

03:26.910 --> 03:28.461
I'm so sorry.

03:28.495 --> 03:30.046
I have
a developmental disorder.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.497
Star Wars, Star Wars.
Cool, cool, cool. Hmm.

03:31.531 --> 03:32.965
You understand.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.701
You're also, quite frankly,
a very weird-looking man.

03:35.736 --> 03:39.105
I don't know you,
but I just don't trust you.

03:39.139 --> 03:40.706
And I don't think
I could grow to like you.

03:40.741 --> 03:42.408
The point of what I'm trying
to tell you, Todd,

03:42.442 --> 03:43.876
is that I don't want
to be your lab partner.

03:43.910 --> 03:44.894
No offense.

03:44.928 --> 03:46.112
None taken.

03:46.146 --> 03:48.014
I understand, you wanna be
with your friends.

03:48.048 --> 03:50.149
Don't tell me what I'm feeling
or thinking. It's petty.

03:50.183 --> 03:52.935
Good-bye, Todd.

03:52.986 --> 03:57.990
Okay, how are we
gonna divide the--

03:58.025 --> 04:01.110
Hey, Todd! Todd, buddy!
You passed the test.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.765
I've been walking my beat
a long time, sir.

04:05.799 --> 04:07.266
A long time.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.468
I've kept my head down,
paid my dues.

04:09.503 --> 04:11.737
And, well, I think I'm ready
to make detective.

04:11.772 --> 04:13.572
You've only been here a month.

04:13.607 --> 04:15.441
You really haven't done
much of anything.

04:15.475 --> 04:18.444
And there's no such thing
as security guard detective.

04:18.478 --> 04:20.762
We don't solve crimes.

04:20.797 --> 04:22.348
We barely prevent them.

04:22.382 --> 04:25.084
You wanna detect something?

04:25.102 --> 04:29.922
Do it on your own time.

04:29.956 --> 04:32.224
Maybe I will.

04:32.259 --> 04:34.977
"Maybe I will."

04:35.028 --> 04:39.315
My own words rang in my head
like a bell inside a head.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.866
Maybe I was crazy.

04:40.901 --> 04:45.938
Or maybe, just maybe,
I was a detective.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.941
- Hey.
- What?

04:48.959 --> 04:51.210
- Looking for something?
- No.

04:51.244 --> 04:52.344
She said she wasn't,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.046
but her eyes said otherwise.

04:54.081 --> 04:56.348
She was all dame,
legs that went all the way

04:56.383 --> 04:57.683
to the bottom of her torso.

04:57.717 --> 04:59.885
The kind of arms
that had elbows.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.155
Um...Did you just call me
in here to stare at me?

05:09.963 --> 05:12.665
The way she left,
I could tell that somebody--

05:12.699 --> 05:15.501
or something--had really
put the scare on her.

05:15.535 --> 05:17.570
But what? Why?

05:17.604 --> 05:19.038
Stapler.

05:19.072 --> 05:20.539
Was I crazy?

05:20.574 --> 05:23.042
Or were they somehow connected?

05:23.076 --> 05:24.577
I can't believe it.

05:24.611 --> 05:27.196
This is the first time there
hasn't been a beetle in here.

05:27.247 --> 05:29.381
- Should we move outside?
- Uh-huh.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.950
Did you even hear what I said?

05:30.984 --> 05:33.586
- Uh-huh.
- Seriously?

05:33.620 --> 05:35.287
Is this what it's gonna be
like working together?

05:35.322 --> 05:36.355
What?

05:36.389 --> 05:38.724
I lost three followers?

05:38.758 --> 05:40.192
Man, people just
can't handle the truth

05:40.227 --> 05:42.962
about Ben Sherman's
winter collection.

05:45.899 --> 05:47.516
Roommates, study group,
lab partners.

05:47.551 --> 05:49.135
We really are gonna spend
all our time together.

05:49.169 --> 05:50.202
How awesome is that?

05:50.237 --> 05:52.271
Very.
You know what else is awesome?

05:52.305 --> 05:53.772
Last night I saw
the Hong Kong movie.

05:53.807 --> 05:55.040
That Kickpuncher is based on.

05:55.075 --> 05:56.475
Yeah, I know, I was there.

05:56.510 --> 05:57.509
Did you see the scene where
Kickpuncher kick-punches

05:57.527 --> 05:59.178
200 guys with one kick-punch?

05:59.212 --> 06:01.914
Yeah.
Both of them.

06:01.948 --> 06:03.749
Oh.

06:03.783 --> 06:07.453
We spend
too much time together.

06:07.487 --> 06:08.554
Jinx.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.156
Here's Ben with his cupcake.

06:11.241 --> 06:12.558
And here he is
a few seconds later

06:12.592 --> 06:14.460
when he was crying because
he dropped his cupcake.

06:14.494 --> 06:15.494
Mm-hmm.

06:15.528 --> 06:17.246
And here he is
with another cupcake.

06:17.297 --> 06:18.330
Oh, oh, wait, these pictures
are out of order.

06:18.364 --> 06:19.532
That's the same cupcake.

06:19.566 --> 06:22.718
Oh, Shirley, these pictures
are adorable.

06:22.752 --> 06:23.903
And comprehensive.

06:23.937 --> 06:26.772
But did you know that
sugar is like baby meth?

06:26.806 --> 06:28.340
That's what my homeopath said.

06:28.375 --> 06:32.094
Well, maybe your gay friend
should mind his own business.

06:32.145 --> 06:35.848
"Forget about the girl,"
I told myself.

06:35.882 --> 06:39.185
"Let her go, like
a lobster claw letting go

06:39.219 --> 06:41.854
of a small balloon
for lobsters."

06:41.888 --> 06:44.490
Still, I had a hunch.

06:44.524 --> 06:47.559
Hmm. A matchbook.

06:47.577 --> 06:49.561
Something about it
seemed clue-y.

06:49.579 --> 06:52.448
"Arizona matchbook company."

06:52.499 --> 06:54.066
Arizona.

06:54.084 --> 06:56.769
Arizona backwards
is still Arizona!

06:56.803 --> 06:58.971
It's a palomino!

06:59.005 --> 07:00.072
Maybe I was crazy...

07:00.106 --> 07:03.209
Or maybe I was finally sane.

07:05.779 --> 07:09.215
Why does this guy keep
staring at me?

07:13.286 --> 07:15.621
Britta.
What are you doing here?

07:15.655 --> 07:17.256
Oh, I was just
getting some air.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.442
Me too.
And wondering something.

07:20.477 --> 07:21.777
I was wondering something, too.

07:21.811 --> 07:23.395
- Tell me.
- No, you first.

07:23.430 --> 07:24.897
I was wondering,
what would it be like

07:24.931 --> 07:27.399
- if we were partners?
- What's going on here?

07:27.433 --> 07:28.734
Were you thinking of
changing partners?

07:28.768 --> 07:30.736
Who's thinking
of changing partners?

07:30.770 --> 07:32.771
Were you gonna bail on me?

07:32.806 --> 07:36.075
No. No one here is thinking
of changing partners. No, sir.

07:36.109 --> 07:37.276
I am!

07:37.294 --> 07:39.612
While he was spying,
I found a turtle.

07:39.646 --> 07:41.463
It's not fair that
I should be the only one here

07:41.498 --> 07:44.750
saddled with a total waste
of space loser.

07:44.784 --> 07:46.819
- No offense, Todd.
- None taken.

07:46.853 --> 07:49.088
Why should you all get
the exact partner you wanted?

07:49.122 --> 07:50.556
That's right.

07:50.590 --> 07:53.959
It's totally not fair that
we saddled Pierce with Todd.

07:53.977 --> 07:55.561
We should probably
choose partners again.

07:55.595 --> 07:56.895
I mean, just to be fair.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.664
So it's agreed.
Let's go to the study room

07:58.698 --> 08:01.066
and deal with this Todd problem
once and for all.

08:01.101 --> 08:02.351
Okay.

08:02.402 --> 08:04.603
Um, did you want me to come?

08:04.638 --> 08:07.413
Um, it's called
"the Todd problem."

08:16.410 --> 08:19.772
Okay, we just have to come up
with a fair way

08:19.892 --> 08:23.364
to decide who is gonna be stuck
for an entire semester

08:23.399 --> 08:26.653
with this... Random.

08:26.749 --> 08:29.250
This, uh... Non-grouper.

08:29.285 --> 08:30.485
No offense, Todd.

08:30.519 --> 08:33.288
None taken.
I'm happy to work with whoever.

08:33.322 --> 08:35.357
There's only one way
to decide this fairly.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.258
We go boy-girl, boy-girl.

08:37.293 --> 08:39.561
But everyone has to have
a different hair color.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.062
And be from a different
high school.

08:41.097 --> 08:43.264
And be a different race.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.300
I guess I'd be with... Britta.

08:45.334 --> 08:48.269
I guess my--my hands are tied.

08:48.304 --> 08:49.471
The hair color concept
intrigues me

08:49.505 --> 08:50.839
because it's how
I distinguish you anyway.

08:50.873 --> 08:52.390
But what if we arrange by age,
so that way

08:52.425 --> 08:53.708
the young people can work
while the old people sleep

08:53.726 --> 08:55.143
and vice versa.

08:55.177 --> 08:56.511
Um, I-I was just wondering
who you considered old,

08:56.545 --> 08:59.014
because I'd like
to remind you again

08:59.048 --> 09:00.915
that I'm just about
the same age as Jeff.

09:00.950 --> 09:02.100
Oh, I was counting Jeff
as old, too.

09:02.151 --> 09:03.218
Hey!

09:03.252 --> 09:04.719
Oh, well, that's
all right then.

09:04.737 --> 09:06.888
I just don't understand how
my age has anything to--

09:06.922 --> 09:09.357
Oh, for heaven's sake, Pierce!

09:09.391 --> 09:11.159
I was thinking the thing
that would be most beneficial--

09:11.193 --> 09:12.927
you know, for the group--
would be

09:12.962 --> 09:15.797
to pair the people with the
lowest GPAs with the highest.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.432
Hmm. Interesting.

09:17.466 --> 09:19.467
The highest
carrying the lowest?

09:19.502 --> 09:21.202
I can see how
you might want that.

09:21.237 --> 09:22.253
You know what, Annie?

09:22.288 --> 09:24.606
Pew, pew, pew, pew, p--

09:24.640 --> 09:28.376
Wait, no.
Pew, pew, pew, pew.

09:28.411 --> 09:30.311
Does anyone else have kids?

09:30.346 --> 09:32.947
Because I have a gorgeous little
newborn that I'd like to get--

09:32.982 --> 09:34.132
Oh, perfect!

09:34.183 --> 09:36.084
You'll enjoy talking to Shirley
about her kids.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.620
Uh-uh, don't go trying to pawn
Todd off on me.

09:38.654 --> 09:40.121
Again, none taken.

09:40.156 --> 09:42.991
Guys, our terrariums are due
tomorrow and it's already nine.

09:43.025 --> 09:45.393
Okay, let's make this simple
and do it like student housing.

09:45.428 --> 09:47.696
Everyone write down
their lab partner preferences

09:47.730 --> 09:48.730
from one to eight.

09:48.764 --> 09:50.465
Abed, you're a computer.

09:50.499 --> 09:52.434
You figure out a way to put us
in our optimal pairings.

09:52.468 --> 09:55.837
And before you all go
putting Todd down last,

09:55.871 --> 09:57.972
don't forget he comes
with a turtle.

09:58.007 --> 09:59.507
You're halfway done.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.042
How does that sound?

10:02.678 --> 10:04.112
Somebody wake up Pierce.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.047
Hello, Arizona
matchbook company.

10:06.082 --> 10:07.515
I had to get some answers.

10:07.550 --> 10:10.652
And I needed answers like a fish
needs a bicycle-- A lot.

10:10.686 --> 10:12.320
Hello?
Hello?

10:12.354 --> 10:14.723
Yeah, I am, uh, interested
in your matchbooks.

10:14.757 --> 10:16.091
Yes, would you like
to place an order?

10:16.125 --> 10:18.526
I had to think fast.

10:18.561 --> 10:20.595
- Yes.
- Get away from my desk.

10:20.629 --> 10:21.730
I'll call you back.

10:21.764 --> 10:23.031
You've been walking
around campus

10:23.065 --> 10:25.300
asking people weird questions
and then staring at them

10:25.334 --> 10:26.668
while slightly
moving your lips?

10:26.702 --> 10:28.069
I had to think fast.

10:28.104 --> 10:29.204
No.

10:29.238 --> 10:33.842
Ben... I think this job
might be getting to you.

10:33.876 --> 10:35.477
I think you need
to take some time off.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.545
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

10:37.580 --> 10:41.316
Very much so.
Yes.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.051
All right, yep.

10:43.085 --> 10:45.319
According to my system,
Annie's gonna be with Shirley.

10:45.337 --> 10:46.671
Pierce is with me.
Troy is with Britta.

10:46.705 --> 10:47.756
And Jeff is with Todd.

10:47.790 --> 10:49.724
Okay, let's get to work.

10:49.759 --> 10:52.927
Uh, wait. Um, how did
I end up with Todd?

10:52.962 --> 10:54.262
I mean, no offense,

10:54.296 --> 10:55.764
but he wasn't exactly
at the top of my list.

10:55.798 --> 10:56.898
None taken.

10:56.932 --> 10:58.199
It's what the algorithm
dictated.

10:58.234 --> 10:59.300
And we're just supposed
to trust your algorithm?

10:59.335 --> 11:00.668
You're questioning
my algorithm?

11:00.686 --> 11:02.387
Not necessarily. Is your
algorithm above questioning?

11:02.438 --> 11:03.438
Not necessarily.

11:03.472 --> 11:04.706
Will you just tell us
how you chose?

11:04.740 --> 11:06.341
I used the ballots to rank
everyone by popularity.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.042
And I put the most popular
with the least popular.

11:08.077 --> 11:10.145
I figured it would maximize each
partnership's audience appeal.

11:10.179 --> 11:11.479
Oh, I-I see.

11:11.514 --> 11:12.814
So I was number one, and
he was obviously number eight.

11:12.848 --> 11:14.032
No offense, Todd.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.033
You and Todd
were four and five.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.185
I was four?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.753
- Todd was four.
- I was five?

11:18.788 --> 11:19.921
Well, that's insane!

11:19.955 --> 11:21.355
We don't even know him.

11:21.373 --> 11:22.407
He's a stranger.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.926
Please, Jeff.
It has feelings.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.528
Wait, so we all know
Annie was number one,

11:26.562 --> 11:29.697
because she'd do all the work.

11:29.715 --> 11:32.750
And Shirley was
her partner, so...

11:32.802 --> 11:34.919
But that means--
so you all put--

11:34.970 --> 11:37.605
I just worked it out.

11:37.640 --> 11:41.276
I'm more popular than someone!

11:41.310 --> 11:46.064
Getting the matchbooks shipped
to me the same day wasn't easy.

11:46.098 --> 11:47.882
I had to pay the company money.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.018
I used Nunez's card.

11:50.052 --> 11:52.553
He'd thank me at
the Detective Awards.

11:52.571 --> 11:56.557
Somewhere, somehow, I was gonna
find what I was looking for.

12:09.872 --> 12:12.407
Holy Mary, mother of God.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.409
Was I crazy?

12:14.443 --> 12:16.110
Or was I on
the verge of something?

12:16.145 --> 12:18.263
My mind reeled with thoughts.

12:18.297 --> 12:20.248
Voices.
Stand-up premises.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.150
Why don't they just make tires
out of pavement

12:22.184 --> 12:24.018
so you can drive on anything?
What's up with buttons?

12:24.053 --> 12:26.421
What would happen if
Nicholson was a gynecologist?

12:26.455 --> 12:28.556
There was something there.

12:28.591 --> 12:30.225
I need a notepad.

12:30.259 --> 12:32.694
Maybe a blazer.

12:34.947 --> 12:37.832
Honey, I-I-I don't know
when I'll be home.

12:37.867 --> 12:40.835
How could you guys hate me
more than Pierce?

12:40.870 --> 12:42.403
Or anything more than Pierce?

12:42.437 --> 12:43.771
Thin ice, Shirley.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.506
My friends and I
are not gonna let you

12:45.541 --> 12:47.175
drive a wedge between us.

12:47.209 --> 12:48.626
Shirley has a point.

12:48.661 --> 12:51.246
This list stinks
like a butt convention.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.148
How else could you explain
Troy being so unpopular?

12:54.183 --> 12:57.018
Uh, I think I was
the popular one in our pairing.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.053
Oh, Troy.

13:02.057 --> 13:04.592
Fine, why don't I just
go work with Todd?

13:04.627 --> 13:08.029
Hey, that's cool,
whatever gets this project done.

13:08.063 --> 13:10.498
Oh, wow, what a great guy.

13:10.532 --> 13:12.934
I can see why all of you like
him so much more than me.

13:12.968 --> 13:16.604
Jeff, maybe it's just that no
one wants to carry you all year.

13:16.638 --> 13:19.707
Gee, you're right, Annie,
it's not personal.

13:19.742 --> 13:21.509
I mean, it's not like
people really like you.

13:21.543 --> 13:23.378
You're just a good grade
in a tight sweater.

13:23.412 --> 13:25.847
You're just a bad grade
in a tight sweater.

13:25.881 --> 13:27.115
And who the hell
are you always texting?

13:27.149 --> 13:29.350
Everyone you know is here.

13:29.385 --> 13:30.668
Okay, let's all just
take a breath--

13:30.703 --> 13:32.537
Don't get your number four
stink on this, Todd.

13:32.588 --> 13:34.222
Okay, let's focus.

13:34.256 --> 13:38.927
We're all the same people
we were 12 hours ago.

13:38.961 --> 13:40.678
Maybe we should just revert
to our original pairings.

13:40.713 --> 13:42.330
But I thought you didn't want
to carry Jeff.

13:42.348 --> 13:43.381
Oh, you just don't want
to work with Shirley.

13:45.334 --> 13:47.018
You too, brute?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.170
It's just...
You're a creationist!

13:49.204 --> 13:51.439
- What?
- You're so religious.

13:51.473 --> 13:53.274
How are you gonna do
science experiments

13:53.309 --> 13:54.709
if you don't even
believe in science?

13:54.743 --> 13:56.611
Just because someone's
religious doesn't mean

13:56.645 --> 13:58.179
they have a problem
with science.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.814
And certainly,

13:59.848 --> 14:02.150
if an introductory biology
course at a community college

14:02.184 --> 14:04.569
can refute 2,000 years
of miracles--

14:05.754 --> 14:06.871
And what about Britta?

14:06.905 --> 14:08.489
She's not gonna
dissect anything.

14:08.524 --> 14:11.359
Fine, you got me, I won't
dissect anything with a face.

14:11.377 --> 14:12.860
What about worms?

14:12.878 --> 14:14.495
Do they have tiny little faces?

14:14.530 --> 14:15.913
This is why
you're the stupidest!

14:15.965 --> 14:18.866
If loving worms is stupid,
I don't wanna be smart.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.052
It is, and you can't be.

14:21.086 --> 14:23.538
Guys, I just figured it
all out.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.574
Pierce, wake up,
Jeff is gonna heal us.

14:26.608 --> 14:28.109
We have been looking
at this totally wrong.

14:28.143 --> 14:30.878
There's no way I'm unpopular.

14:30.896 --> 14:32.814
One of you monsters
just put me last

14:32.848 --> 14:35.016
in a petty attempt
to humble me.

14:35.050 --> 14:36.651
Oh!

14:36.685 --> 14:40.254
I just had a terrible nightmare
that Jeff was a pompous ass.

14:40.289 --> 14:41.906
Also Todd was there.

14:41.940 --> 14:45.226
Uh, no offense, Todd.

14:52.618 --> 14:54.802
I'd poked my nose
where it didn't belong.

14:54.837 --> 14:58.406
Someone--or something--
had sent me a message.

15:00.175 --> 15:02.126
Veronica.

15:02.177 --> 15:05.780
It was my fault she had
gotten mixed up in all this.

15:08.851 --> 15:10.084
Uh-uh, Todd.

15:10.119 --> 15:11.819
Pretty sure I heard
a fire alarm.

15:11.854 --> 15:13.554
Nobody's going home until
we see those ballots.

15:13.588 --> 15:15.356
See the ballots?
Are you crazy?

15:15.391 --> 15:17.425
I say let's lay our cards
on the table

15:17.443 --> 15:19.593
and see what everyone really
thinks of each other.

15:19.611 --> 15:21.562
Get behind me, Abed.

15:23.265 --> 15:24.699
Jeff, stop it!

15:24.733 --> 15:25.933
Pass!

15:25.968 --> 15:27.652
Give it to me!
No, get back, get back!

15:27.703 --> 15:29.404
I am doing this for all of us.

15:29.438 --> 15:31.289
Oh, no, she's got
her marijuana lighter.

15:31.323 --> 15:33.741
Don't!

15:33.776 --> 15:37.211
Noooo!
The turtle is in there!

15:37.246 --> 15:38.946
Oh, my God, I am so sorry!

15:38.964 --> 15:43.251
What is wrong with you people?

15:43.285 --> 15:46.254
Huh?

15:46.288 --> 15:49.257
I thought you were
supposed to be friends!

15:49.291 --> 15:53.478
I thought you were supposed
to love each other!

15:53.512 --> 15:56.297
Your love is weird.

15:56.315 --> 15:58.466
And toxic!

15:58.484 --> 16:01.669
And it destroys
everything it touches!

16:01.703 --> 16:04.939
I no longer care about grades.

16:04.973 --> 16:09.026
Or biology. Or finally
graduating from college,

16:09.078 --> 16:13.081
like I promised
my dying father.

16:13.115 --> 16:15.783
I'm going home.

16:15.817 --> 16:18.503
I'm gonna hold my wife
and my child close.

16:18.537 --> 16:23.825
And I am gonna finally
take my Insulin shot!

16:23.859 --> 16:29.097
Offense taken.

16:29.131 --> 16:32.633
Offense taken.

16:36.105 --> 16:37.905
Well, he is right
about one thing.

16:37.940 --> 16:39.507
You're all terrible people.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.776
And I don't care about
this stupid assignment.

16:41.810 --> 16:45.546
I'm going home.

16:45.581 --> 16:47.448
No, I'm not,
I'm going to biology class.

16:47.483 --> 16:50.067
It starts in 15 minutes.

16:53.003 --> 16:55.351
And eventually, this caterpillar

16:55.591 --> 16:58.392
will come out of its cocoon.
And then--

16:58.427 --> 17:00.011
Pop, pop!

17:02.717 --> 17:05.031
Nice work, you two.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.246
You know they're laughing
at you, right?

17:07.538 --> 17:08.950
I mean, that's my theory.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.405
Now, super group.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.471
I can't help but notice
a sorry lack of terrariums.

17:15.590 --> 17:16.924
We didn't have time to finish.

17:16.942 --> 17:18.827
Here's mine.

17:18.861 --> 17:20.747
When did you even
have time to do that?

17:20.867 --> 17:22.068
You're pathological.

17:22.102 --> 17:23.836
It's too late for flattery.

17:23.869 --> 17:26.704
Professor, obviously
this isn't working out.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.741
You're just gonna have to put us
with our original lab partners.

17:28.775 --> 17:31.544
- All right?
- I don't have to do anything.

17:31.578 --> 17:33.379
Not after you broke
my boy Todd.

17:33.413 --> 17:35.314
That man called me
crying this morning.

17:35.348 --> 17:37.183
You know he fought
in Iraq, right?

17:37.217 --> 17:40.186
We had a name for people
like you in prison.

17:40.220 --> 17:42.488
We called you
"the mean clique."

17:43.523 --> 17:44.924
But I have a solution.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.593
All seven of you
will share a microscope,

17:47.627 --> 17:49.762
one bench, and one grade
that I will average.

17:49.796 --> 17:51.330
Everyone else gets
their own stuff.

17:51.364 --> 17:53.599
So can we get an extension
on the first assignment?

17:53.633 --> 17:57.369
No. You all fail.

17:59.573 --> 18:01.941
Oh, my God.

18:01.975 --> 18:03.275
How did this happen?

18:03.309 --> 18:04.994
And did I miss the firemen?

18:05.028 --> 18:07.246
Dean, the explanation
is simple.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.665
It's all connected.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.667
A web of conspiracy that goes

18:11.701 --> 18:14.520
all the way to the top
of Arizona.

18:14.554 --> 18:17.123
All... Right.

18:17.157 --> 18:20.209
Hey, somebody's been
squatting in the utility closet.

18:20.260 --> 18:23.462
There's a hot plate back there,
thousands of matches.

18:23.497 --> 18:25.531
I mean, we're looking at dozens

18:25.565 --> 18:30.019
of major health
and fire code violations.

18:30.053 --> 18:32.338
I think we're gonna have to get
the police involved.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.740
And that's when it hit me.

18:34.774 --> 18:36.375
I was in really big trouble.

18:36.409 --> 18:39.061
Dean.

18:39.112 --> 18:40.112
Dean?

18:40.147 --> 18:43.115
Oh, uh...No.

18:43.150 --> 18:44.583
No need to get the cops.

18:44.618 --> 18:49.021
With a conspiracy this big,
they're probably involved.

18:49.039 --> 18:51.190
- What?
- What Chang says

18:51.208 --> 18:53.259
makes a lot of sense,
and, um...

18:53.293 --> 18:56.061
Okay, you know what?
I quit.

18:56.096 --> 18:58.430
I mean, I can deal
with the not getting paid,

18:58.465 --> 19:02.067
but I draw the line
at you enabling this man.

19:02.102 --> 19:05.538
I mean, I'm seriously concerned
that he's mentally ill.

19:05.572 --> 19:08.274
And--and it's not funny
at all. It's scary.

19:08.308 --> 19:10.276
- The top of Arizona...
- I needed to know more.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.710
- Was it a very high mesa?
- About those firemen.

19:11.745 --> 19:13.345
- Or was it a state of mind?
- Were they ethnically diverse?

19:13.380 --> 19:14.980
- Either way, I was going...
- Did they bring a dalmatian?

19:15.015 --> 19:16.382
- To have to climb it.
- Could I buy a calendar?

19:16.416 --> 19:21.754
Okay, screw this.
I-I quit.

19:21.788 --> 19:23.989
Hmm?

19:24.024 --> 19:27.059
Well, it seems that Greendale
owes you a debt of gratitude.

19:27.093 --> 19:30.196
How would you like to be
the new head of security?

19:30.230 --> 19:31.664
I had to think fast.

19:31.698 --> 19:32.731
Yes.

19:32.766 --> 19:35.918
I don't know, was I crazy?

19:35.952 --> 19:38.237
Or was I just doing right
by the school?

19:50.750 --> 19:52.751
- This is awkward, isn't it?
- Yeah.

19:52.786 --> 19:54.586
You know, I think
it's pretty clear

19:54.604 --> 19:56.922
what destroyed the balance
in our study group's ecosystem.

19:56.957 --> 19:58.857
Ranking one person
above another.

19:58.892 --> 20:00.776
Letting our differences
get the bets of us.

20:00.810 --> 20:02.928
- Racism?
- No.

20:02.963 --> 20:04.230
Todd.

20:04.264 --> 20:07.233
Todd!

20:07.267 --> 20:08.701
Did you see the head
on that guy?

20:08.735 --> 20:09.702
"None taken."

20:09.736 --> 20:11.337
What was wrong with him?

20:11.371 --> 20:13.439
Not to be unchristian,
but that boy sucked.

20:13.473 --> 20:14.974
I missed this.

20:15.008 --> 20:16.008
Aww!

20:16.042 --> 20:17.376
And his dumb baby!

20:17.410 --> 20:18.510
- I know!
- On and on.

20:18.545 --> 20:20.512
He wouldn't shut up.

20:38.885 --> 20:40.926
These questions
are really personal.

20:41.046 --> 20:42.227
Are you sure this is anonymous?

20:42.262 --> 20:44.210
Yeah, they're just
practice evaluations

20:44.330 --> 20:45.637
for my psych class.

20:47.016 --> 20:48.767
All right.
Who did a butt?

20:48.801 --> 20:51.570
They're boobs.
And I don't know.

20:51.604 --> 20:52.721
Take it again.

20:52.772 --> 20:53.889
All right.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.274
Somebody drew a penis.

20:55.308 --> 20:57.476
Oh! And another penis.

20:57.510 --> 21:00.896
Penis, penis, penis.
Very mature, guys.

21:00.947 --> 21:05.284
- I didn't draw a penis.
- Me neither.

21:05.318 --> 21:07.903
Yeah, these are all
normally filled out tests.

21:07.954 --> 21:10.372
Ha ha! Gotcha!

21:10.406 --> 21:13.742
This was also a test,
and you all penised.

21:13.793 --> 21:15.394
Passed.

21:15.428 --> 21:17.362
Maybe I need to take one.

21:17.397 --> 21:19.431
A test.
Not a penis.
