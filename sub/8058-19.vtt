07:26.361 --> 07:29.162
Just like the time
they couldn't decide

07:29.197 --> 07:31.398
who gets the dog,
so they just dropped it off

07:31.432 --> 07:32.566
at a local synagogue.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.469
I was like, "Wh--wh--say what?"

07:35.503 --> 07:36.803
[Cell phone ringing]

07:36.838 --> 07:37.871
Hold on, Ron.

07:37.906 --> 07:39.406
Hold that thought,
just for a sec.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.540
[Cell phone ringing]

07:40.575 --> 07:41.708
Hey, honey.

07:41.743 --> 07:43.710
Hey.
It's your me.

07:43.745 --> 07:44.878
It's wife.

07:44.913 --> 07:47.381
It's Leslie, uh, Knope.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.049
I have very big news for you.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.385
Oh, my teeth are blue.

07:51.419 --> 07:52.953
- Blueberries are alcohol...
- What?

07:52.987 --> 07:54.388
Are you having a stroke?

07:54.422 --> 07:56.823
And I was just saying to Ron
that my dog's Jewish.

07:56.858 --> 07:57.824
Oh.

07:57.859 --> 07:58.825
Phone water.

07:58.860 --> 07:59.993
Ben?

08:00.028 --> 08:01.161
Hello?

08:01.196 --> 08:02.496
Hello?

08:02.530 --> 08:03.664
Hi.

08:03.698 --> 08:04.665
Leslie?

08:04.699 --> 08:05.666
It's dead.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.501
Hello?

08:07.535 --> 08:08.568
[Sighs]

08:08.603 --> 08:10.737
You know, Leslie sounded weird.

08:10.772 --> 08:11.932
I don't want to wait for Tom.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.206
I want to walk home.

08:13.241 --> 08:14.374
I'll join you.

08:14.409 --> 08:16.210
I'm always game
for a brisk walk.

08:16.244 --> 08:19.246
Also, if I leave you alone,
I'm pretty sure you'll die.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.514
Home is that way.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.458
Watch out for that fence.

08:32.493 --> 08:34.628
Ah, Mr. Haverford,

08:34.662 --> 08:37.798
allow me to introduce
Terrence Montreaux.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.299
He is a restaurateur
like yourself.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.534
You own a restaurant too?

08:40.568 --> 08:42.034
No, monsieur.

08:42.070 --> 08:43.537
I own 12.

08:43.571 --> 08:45.372
I am here to find
the best sommeliers

08:45.406 --> 08:47.040
as soon as they are...

08:47.075 --> 08:49.543
how you say, um,
"certified."

08:49.577 --> 08:50.544
That was my idea.

08:50.578 --> 08:52.379
That is everyone's idea.

08:52.413 --> 08:55.415
That is why we have this,
how you say...

08:55.450 --> 08:56.617
"thing."

08:56.651 --> 08:57.784
Okay, don't act like
you don't know

08:57.819 --> 08:59.486
the word "thing."

08:59.520 --> 09:01.822
With a filet mignon,
I'd recommend a red--

09:01.856 --> 09:04.591
something bold and dry,
like David Sedaris.

09:04.626 --> 09:07.394
Perhaps you could recommend
a Riesling instead.

09:07.428 --> 09:09.396
Not if you're eating steak,
you loon!

09:09.430 --> 09:12.166
You know in the movies,
when the cops show up

09:12.200 --> 09:13.834
and find lipstick
on a wine glass

09:13.868 --> 09:16.003
next to a dead body?

09:16.037 --> 09:17.604
This is that wine.

09:17.639 --> 09:19.439
♪ I'll bring the girls ♪

09:19.474 --> 09:21.775
♪ you bring the beer ♪

09:21.809 --> 09:23.610
♪ and the troops will bring
the freedom ♪

09:23.645 --> 09:25.779
We're sorry to interrupt,
Chipp, hi.

09:25.813 --> 09:28.282
We just wanted to say
we are such big fans.

09:28.316 --> 09:29.450
It's an honor to meet you.

09:29.484 --> 09:30.784
Yeah, well, I'm very blessed.

09:30.818 --> 09:32.452
It's always nice
to meet my amazing fans

09:32.487 --> 09:33.620
that keep me going.

09:33.655 --> 09:35.289
You're the real superstars.

09:35.323 --> 09:36.557
[Laughs] Thank you.

09:36.591 --> 09:38.725
Would somebody get me
one of those lunch stacks?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.427
And stack 'em for me this time.

09:40.461 --> 09:42.262
Cheese on top
or no one gets paid.

09:42.297 --> 09:43.597
You got it, Chipp.

09:43.631 --> 09:44.598
That's my dad.

09:44.632 --> 09:46.600
The guy's such an idiot.

09:46.634 --> 09:48.101
We wanted to talk to you

09:48.136 --> 09:50.904
about the unity concert,
in Pawnee.

09:50.939 --> 09:52.239
Can you do it?

09:52.273 --> 09:53.907
Yeah...uh, no.

09:53.942 --> 09:55.342
Sorry.
I got a previous engagement.

09:55.376 --> 09:56.343
It's a bummer.

09:56.377 --> 09:58.111
Oh.

09:58.146 --> 09:59.613
- Here you go, Chipp.
- Look at that.

09:59.647 --> 10:00.781
The cheese is on top...

10:00.815 --> 10:02.616
of turkey, you dick.

10:02.650 --> 10:03.817
I want ham.

10:03.851 --> 10:06.053
I'm sorry, son.
They were out of ham.

10:06.087 --> 10:07.387
All right, well,
maybe I should just let mom

10:07.422 --> 10:09.056
be manager, then.

10:09.090 --> 10:10.724
Pick 'em up, skip.

10:10.758 --> 10:13.060
Ew.
This guy's the worst.

10:13.094 --> 10:15.229
I mean, it sucks
that they didn't have ham,

10:15.263 --> 10:17.064
but you can't treat your dad
like that.

10:17.098 --> 10:18.732
I know, he's a monster.

10:18.766 --> 10:20.067
But we need him.

10:20.101 --> 10:21.401
Your job's not that hard, okay?

10:21.436 --> 10:23.070
Just anticipate my needs.

10:23.104 --> 10:24.671
Anticipatin', Chipp.

10:24.706 --> 10:29.843
Of the 25 entrants today,
only 1 has deemed himself

10:29.878 --> 10:32.379
worthy of
a sommelier certificate.

10:32.413 --> 10:34.048
Oh, my God.
Are you sure?

10:34.082 --> 10:35.048
No way.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.216
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

10:36.251 --> 10:38.051
Thank you so much, everyone.

10:38.086 --> 10:41.221
I think we can agree
that all wine tastes the same,

10:41.256 --> 10:44.224
and if you spend
more than $5 on wine,

10:44.259 --> 10:46.493
you are very stupid.

10:46.527 --> 10:47.794
Security.

10:47.829 --> 10:49.296
I just want to thank
all the people that got me here:

10:49.330 --> 10:53.300
Norbit, Pluto Nash,
all the klumps.

10:53.334 --> 10:58.639
Congratulations to the next
Indiana master sommelier,

10:58.673 --> 11:00.207
Xander Truffant.

11:00.241 --> 11:02.876
[Applause]

11:02.911 --> 11:04.945
Got to go talk to Xander
before Terrence gets to him.

11:04.979 --> 11:07.581
Cover me.
Gotcha.

11:07.615 --> 11:08.749
Oh, my goodness.

11:08.783 --> 11:09.917
<i>Mon Dieu !</i>

11:09.951 --> 11:11.051
<i>Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?</i>

11:11.085 --> 11:13.220
Oh, <i>je suis desolée, monsieur.</i>

11:13.254 --> 11:14.421
<i>Allons-y.</i>
<i>Allons-y.</i>

11:14.455 --> 11:15.722
Xander.

11:15.757 --> 11:18.725
Look, Tom's Bistro
is going to be the dopest,

11:18.760 --> 11:21.662
quite possibly trillest
restaurant in the area.

11:21.696 --> 11:23.230
What do you say?
You want to work with me?

11:23.264 --> 11:24.765
Thank you,
but I've already accepted

11:24.799 --> 11:26.366
an offer
from Monsieur Montreaux.

11:26.401 --> 11:28.569
I'll double
whatever he's paying you.

11:28.603 --> 11:30.938
You'll pay me $500,000 a year?

11:30.972 --> 11:34.374
I will pay you 1/10
of whatever he's paying you.

11:34.409 --> 11:35.843
Sorry.

11:39.347 --> 11:40.481
Oh, man.

11:40.515 --> 11:42.816
This wine bottle
is all out of the wine.

11:42.851 --> 11:44.651
Well, hello, gentlemen.

11:44.686 --> 11:47.187
What brings you out
on this fine evening?

11:47.222 --> 11:48.489
Mother[bleep].

11:48.523 --> 11:50.023
Whoa.
Where'd you come from?

11:50.058 --> 11:52.359
Uh, that's a complicated
question.

11:52.393 --> 11:54.695
All depends on whether
your conception of time

11:54.729 --> 11:57.064
is linear or circular.

11:57.098 --> 11:59.066
What?

11:59.100 --> 12:00.501
Hello, Ron.

12:00.535 --> 12:01.502
Ron.

12:01.536 --> 12:03.003
You know this hobo?

12:03.037 --> 12:06.540
He was my counterpart from
the Eagleton Parks Department.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.275
Dude, are you a ghost?

12:08.309 --> 12:09.977
Am I?

12:12.147 --> 12:13.847
What is happening right now?

12:13.882 --> 12:16.984
We know that you have
that important other engagement.

12:17.018 --> 12:18.485
Yo, I gots to get that haircut.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.653
Snoop!

12:19.687 --> 12:21.167
It's not just Pawnee
that needs you.

12:21.189 --> 12:22.656
It's the entire region.

12:22.690 --> 12:23.991
Permission to speak, son?

12:24.025 --> 12:26.493
Pawnee is kind of the gateway
to that whole region.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.295
They do buy a lot of albums.

12:28.329 --> 12:29.830
They sure ain't buying
toothpaste.

12:29.864 --> 12:30.998
Bunch of dirty Hicks.

12:31.032 --> 12:32.232
[Laughs]

12:32.267 --> 12:33.667
What if we fly me in and out
same day

12:33.701 --> 12:35.702
so I wouldn't have to spend
a night in your crap town?

12:35.737 --> 12:36.870
Excuse me.

12:36.905 --> 12:38.038
Pawnee is a good town

12:38.072 --> 12:40.407
with good people
from all walks of life.

12:40.441 --> 12:42.409
Plus, it is an amazing place

12:42.443 --> 12:44.077
to raise kids
and start a family.

12:44.112 --> 12:45.412
You think I care about that?

12:45.447 --> 12:47.247
Look, I can do whatever I want,
all right?

12:47.282 --> 12:49.183
If I want to shoot
a paintball gun at my dad,

12:49.217 --> 12:50.184
I'm gonna do it.

12:50.218 --> 12:51.185
[Gun fires]

12:51.219 --> 12:52.853
[Groans] Good shot, son.

12:52.887 --> 12:53.854
I'm proud of you.

12:53.888 --> 12:54.855
You're crazy.

12:54.889 --> 12:55.856
This is over, okay?

12:55.890 --> 12:57.024
Pawnee does not need you.

12:57.058 --> 12:58.392
And you should know that

12:58.426 --> 13:01.261
when you shook my hand earlier,
there was pee on my palms.

13:01.296 --> 13:02.496
That makes us sound like Hicks.

13:02.530 --> 13:03.497
We're not.
Shut up.

13:03.531 --> 13:04.652
Stupid. Okay.
Let's go, Andy.

13:07.756 --> 13:08.996
You know what?
That was awesome.

13:09.024 --> 13:09.710
You were great.

13:09.774 --> 13:11.408
I thought you were gonna
punch that kid's lights out.

13:11.443 --> 13:14.669
It was not awesome.
I lost our headliner.

13:14.789 --> 13:16.406
I can't stop throwing up,

13:16.526 --> 13:18.148
and Ben has not
called me back yet.

13:19.151 --> 13:20.451
I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.

13:20.485 --> 13:22.286
There's just a lot of things
going on right now,

13:22.321 --> 13:24.455
personal things that
I can't talk to you about.

13:24.489 --> 13:26.791
You know, Leslie,

13:26.825 --> 13:30.628
sometimes life
throws us crazy curves,

13:30.662 --> 13:33.864
and, yes, this moment may be

13:33.899 --> 13:37.301
the biggest curve

13:37.336 --> 13:38.969
you've ever had to deal with,

13:39.004 --> 13:41.305
but just because
your family is getting bigger

13:41.340 --> 13:43.974
does not mean
that you can't handle it.

13:44.009 --> 13:45.943
You and Ben
can handle anything.

13:45.978 --> 13:48.779
Wow.

13:48.814 --> 13:50.047
Andy, thank you.

13:50.082 --> 13:53.150
That's exactly
what I needed to hear right now.

13:53.185 --> 13:54.819
God, it's so weird
that you know

13:54.853 --> 13:56.354
that I'm pregnant
before Ben does--

13:56.388 --> 13:57.355
Pregnant?

13:57.389 --> 13:58.589
Holy crap.

13:58.624 --> 13:59.924
Leslie!

13:59.958 --> 14:01.625
Yeah.
Well, what did you think?

14:01.660 --> 14:03.160
I thought
you were getting a dog.

14:03.195 --> 14:04.395
Well, why did you go like this?

14:04.429 --> 14:05.790
That's the sign
for petting a dog

14:05.797 --> 14:06.964
that's sitting on your lap.

14:06.999 --> 14:07.965
But pregnant?

14:08.000 --> 14:08.966
Wow.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.334
Oh, that's amazing.

14:10.369 --> 14:12.336
You know, Andy, I think
we need to focus on the fact

14:12.371 --> 14:13.638
that we have lost
our headliner.

14:13.672 --> 14:14.705
We are out of options.

14:14.740 --> 14:16.140
It's time for a Hail Mary.

14:17.576 --> 14:20.378
How are we gonna convince
this guy to reunite Land Ho?

14:20.412 --> 14:22.713
Same way I got a perfect score
on the S.A.T.s--

14:22.748 --> 14:24.348
broken Scantron machine.

14:24.383 --> 14:26.184
Okay, wait, Andy,
that is not a good strategy.

14:26.218 --> 14:27.852
Okay, I will give him
a brief explanation

14:27.886 --> 14:29.020
about the unity concert,

14:29.054 --> 14:31.522
and you stand by...

14:31.556 --> 14:32.523
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

14:32.557 --> 14:34.592
[Retching]

14:34.626 --> 14:35.593
Hello?

14:35.627 --> 14:37.695
Scott Tanner.

14:37.729 --> 14:40.531
It's Scott Tanner.

14:40.565 --> 14:42.366
Hi.
My name is Andy.

14:42.401 --> 14:45.069
And this barfing lady over here
is Leslie.

14:45.103 --> 14:46.537
We just need ten minutes
of your time.

14:46.571 --> 14:47.672
To do what?

14:47.706 --> 14:49.940
To convince you
to reunite Land Ho.

14:49.975 --> 14:51.275
Listen, it means a lot to me

14:51.310 --> 14:53.277
that you guys loved the band,

14:53.312 --> 14:55.913
and I'm gonna tell you
the exact same thing

14:55.947 --> 14:59.684
I've told everyone
who's ever asked us to reunite:

14:59.718 --> 15:01.519
No.

15:01.553 --> 15:03.033
Listen, I know that
you and the band

15:03.055 --> 15:04.855
aren't on the best of terms
right now.

15:04.890 --> 15:06.524
But bringing people together

15:06.558 --> 15:08.859
is exactly what we want
to talk to you about.

15:13.198 --> 15:14.678
Pull that.
Hold it down on the bottom.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.067
I got it, yeah.

15:16.101 --> 15:18.603
Mr. Ron Dunn,

15:18.637 --> 15:20.771
I have something
I'm very angry about,

15:20.806 --> 15:24.375
but other Ron,
he's not helping me with it.

15:24.409 --> 15:25.743
Can you help?

15:25.777 --> 15:27.745
Well, I can tell
by the indigo on your chiclets

15:27.779 --> 15:30.414
that you've been drinking
blueberry wine.

15:30.449 --> 15:31.916
That's a good start.

15:31.950 --> 15:35.753
The Wamapoke called it
<i>mattapiqua.</i>

15:35.787 --> 15:38.289
They believed
it had mystical powers.

15:38.323 --> 15:40.458
Yeah, it also tastes
like jelly.

15:40.492 --> 15:42.927
So what's got your goat there,
friend?

15:42.961 --> 15:45.096
My parents,
they had this lake house,

15:45.130 --> 15:47.064
and they sold it
without telling me.

15:47.099 --> 15:49.500
And so I was like, "Why?"
You know?

15:49.534 --> 15:52.169
I was like,
"God, you guys!"

15:52.204 --> 15:53.838
Oh, you're hanging on
to that anger

15:53.872 --> 15:56.507
for dear life, compadre.

15:56.541 --> 15:57.942
Let's role-play.

15:57.976 --> 15:59.944
Well, good night, everyone.

15:59.978 --> 16:02.446
I'm going to go home
and feel totally fine.

16:02.481 --> 16:03.781
Who am I kidding?

16:03.815 --> 16:05.656
I'm going to go home,
put on a Macy Gray album,

16:05.684 --> 16:06.951
and cry in the mirror!

16:06.985 --> 16:07.952
Why are you bummed?

16:07.986 --> 16:09.453
Are you all blind?

16:09.488 --> 16:11.122
I want that job
at Tom's Bistro.

16:11.156 --> 16:13.291
I've been trying to show you
for the last five hours.

16:13.325 --> 16:14.959
Look, man, you know your stuff,

16:14.993 --> 16:16.994
but you're like
a crazy volcano.

16:17.029 --> 16:18.929
You'd have to show me
you can bring it down a notch.

16:18.964 --> 16:21.132
I'll bring it down
1,000 notches if I have to!

16:22.534 --> 16:25.169
This looks like
it's gonna be a great concert.

16:25.203 --> 16:27.271
The band
just does not play anymore.

16:27.306 --> 16:28.606
Well, I understand.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.607
[Chokes]

16:29.641 --> 16:31.342
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

16:31.376 --> 16:32.977
My stomach
is trying to murder me.

16:33.011 --> 16:34.445
Still drunk from last night?

16:34.479 --> 16:35.546
I've been there.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.014
You know,
this town still loves you.

16:37.049 --> 16:39.317
I'm in a band myself actually--
Mouse Rat--

16:39.351 --> 16:40.785
and we cover
about five of your songs,

16:40.819 --> 16:41.786

I thought you said
your name was Andy.

16:53.665 --> 16:54.799
Well, it is.

16:54.833 --> 16:57.101
I'm also

17:37.509 --> 17:38.643
Good evening.

17:38.677 --> 17:40.177
May I assist you
with a wine tonight?

17:40.212 --> 17:41.679
Yeah, I'm having fish,

17:41.713 --> 17:44.682
so maybe a full-bodied...

17:44.716 --> 17:45.783
red?

17:45.817 --> 17:47.618
You know, sir,
you might want to consider

17:47.653 --> 17:49.453
something white
to go with your fish.

17:49.488 --> 17:52.123
No.
Red.

17:52.157 --> 17:53.591
And bring some ice cubes.

17:53.625 --> 17:54.792
I like ice cubes
in my red wine.

17:54.826 --> 17:56.294
I'll have a glass

17:56.328 --> 17:58.296
of your most expensive red wine

17:58.330 --> 18:01.132
mixed with a glass
of your cheapest white wine,

18:01.166 --> 18:02.433
served in a dog bowl.

18:02.467 --> 18:05.102
Silly straws all around,
please.

18:05.137 --> 18:08.506
I'll be right back
with my recommendations.

18:08.540 --> 18:09.874
Seems to be
keeping it together.

18:09.908 --> 18:11.375
[Screaming]
What kind of monster

18:11.410 --> 18:13.211
orders red with fish?

18:13.245 --> 18:14.485
I know they're messing with me,

18:14.513 --> 18:16.914
and it's just a test,
but have some decency.

18:18.850 --> 18:20.685
For you, sir,
a light, crisp Pinot

18:20.719 --> 18:22.019
with just a hint of lemon

18:22.054 --> 18:24.555
to bring out the flavors
in your fish.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.223
I brought you a bold Cabernet,

18:26.258 --> 18:28.893
which should still taste okay
when watered down.

18:28.927 --> 18:31.729
And for you, madam,
would you consider this rose?

18:31.763 --> 18:34.198
It's halfway between
red and white.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.866
Thanks very much.

18:35.901 --> 18:37.635
Enjoy.

18:37.669 --> 18:39.904
I think I may have found
my new sommelier.

18:39.938 --> 18:42.139
That was so embarrassing!

18:42.174 --> 18:44.475
We'll have to make sure
the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro

18:44.509 --> 18:45.476
is soundproof.

18:45.510 --> 18:46.477
[Screaming]

18:52.251 --> 18:53.884
That was beautiful.

18:53.919 --> 18:56.220
You're surrendering
to the earth mother.

18:56.255 --> 18:59.423
Now stare into the fire
and picture your spirit animal.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.192
I don't know
what my spirit animal is.

19:01.226 --> 19:02.693
Because it doesn't exist,

19:02.728 --> 19:05.463
because that's nonsense,
because you're an adult.

19:06.999 --> 19:09.467
Baby snow owl.

19:09.501 --> 19:10.835
He's right.

19:10.869 --> 19:14.338
Our spirit animals connect us
to the natural world.

19:14.373 --> 19:17.341
You need to remain open
to their message.

19:17.376 --> 19:19.176
Watch.

[Wings flapping]

Welcome back, old friend.

19:26.618 --> 19:28.085
Whoa.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.422
If you really want to
cleanse yourself of that anger,

19:31.456 --> 19:34.492
take that check
and send it into the flames

19:34.526 --> 19:36.961
and up into the air
with your screams.

19:36.995 --> 19:39.964
Do not burn that check.
It is money.

19:39.998 --> 19:41.966
No.
Ron's right, Ron.

There, there, baby snow owl.

19:51.476 --> 19:52.643
You're safe now.

19:55.541 --> 19:58.408
This is him right here.

19:58.443 --> 20:00.244
I will also get out here
and walk home.

20:00.278 --> 20:01.411
You sure?

20:01.446 --> 20:04.248
This thing runs on vegetable oil
and bat guano.

20:04.282 --> 20:06.650
Actually cleans the air
as it drives.

20:06.684 --> 20:08.352
Quite sure.
Thank you.

20:10.989 --> 20:13.957
Hey, thank you

20:13.992 --> 20:15.926
for helping me with my anger.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.896
You've already
emerged from your cocoon.

20:18.930 --> 20:20.564
Now the question is:

20:20.598 --> 20:22.766
Will you fly?

20:30.675 --> 20:31.975
Yeah, I don't feel any better.

20:32.010 --> 20:33.143
I'm still angry.

20:33.178 --> 20:34.812
Damn it.

20:34.846 --> 20:36.480
I don't know
why this lake house thing

20:36.514 --> 20:38.148
is driving me so crazy.

20:38.183 --> 20:41.819
I'm sorry we couldn't help you
work through your problems.

20:41.853 --> 20:43.987
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a lady,

20:44.022 --> 20:47.558
two little girls, and an infant
waiting for me.

20:47.592 --> 20:49.893
It's always nice to see the kids
at the end of a long day.

20:49.928 --> 20:52.596
Really puts things
in perspective.

20:55.433 --> 20:56.934
[Door closes]

20:56.968 --> 20:59.269
Oh, my God, Ben.
I have so much to tell you.

20:59.304 --> 21:02.473
We got Land Ho
to play the unity concert.

21:02.507 --> 21:03.974
Whoa.
What happened to you?

21:04.008 --> 21:05.642
It doesn't matter.

21:05.677 --> 21:08.478
I thought I was upset
because my parents are insane.

21:08.513 --> 21:11.648
But Ron kind of just showed me
the real reason.

21:11.683 --> 21:14.318
I have so many childhood
memories at that lake house

21:14.352 --> 21:15.819
that, in the back of my mind,

21:15.854 --> 21:18.489
I always pictured
taking my kids--

21:18.523 --> 21:20.557
or taking our kids there.
