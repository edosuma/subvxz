00:17.514 --> 00:18.714
No!

00:18.754 --> 00:20.194
No! No!

00:20.234 --> 00:21.514
No!

00:33.274 --> 00:35.074
Do you love me, Gisborne?

00:36.394 --> 00:37.954
Yes, sire.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.394
I'm so pleased to hear it,

00:40.434 --> 00:43.434
because I don't think the
Sheriff loves his Prince.

00:44.994 --> 00:47.594
No, I don't think he does at all.

00:49.794 --> 00:51.514
My time is almost here, Gisborne.

00:53.714 --> 00:56.114
You know my father,
Henry, God rest his soul,

00:56.154 --> 00:58.874
wanted me to be King,
not my brother Richard?

01:00.034 --> 01:03.634
Me, King. That was his wish.

01:05.714 --> 01:07.474
And I will be, soon.

01:09.314 --> 01:11.674
My father taught me to surround myself

01:11.714 --> 01:15.074
with only those most loyal,
with only those who love me.

01:17.354 --> 01:20.394
You'd make a fine Sheriff, Gisborne.

01:20.434 --> 01:23.154
I'm confident of that.

01:25.394 --> 01:28.594
Does it please you that I
have such confidence in you?

01:28.634 --> 01:31.994
- Yes, sire.
- Hmm.

01:34.874 --> 01:36.674
Robin Hood isn't dead.

01:38.874 --> 01:42.994
I told you, I told the Sheriff...
I wanted Robin Hood dead.

01:43.034 --> 01:45.714
His blood is a gift I covet,
and yet no-one gives it me.

01:45.754 --> 01:49.834
If the Sheriff loved Prince John,

01:49.874 --> 01:52.794
he would give it me,
and yet I do not have it,

01:52.834 --> 01:55.874
ergo he doesn't love me.

01:59.594 --> 02:01.034
Well, I will have blood.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.914
The Sheriff's blood.

02:10.913 --> 02:13.714
You will kill the Sheriff
for me, Gisborne...

02:13.754 --> 02:15.714
discreetly.

02:15.754 --> 02:18.154
Only the two of us will know -

02:18.194 --> 02:20.154
a private secret we can share.

02:20.194 --> 02:24.154
And you will do this for me, Gisborne...

02:25.194 --> 02:28.154
..because you love me.

03:12.314 --> 03:15.274
- Wait!
- All right.

03:15.314 --> 03:18.274
Prince John and his soldiers
have made camp down there!

03:18.314 --> 03:20.194
What? How many men has he got?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.674
- Thousands.
- No!

03:21.714 --> 03:23.234
- Hundreds.
- How much?

03:23.274 --> 03:26.434
I didn't stop and actually count
them! I can't actually count.

03:27.554 --> 03:28.554
Run! Run!

03:36.314 --> 03:38.714
What are they doing in the forest?

03:38.754 --> 03:40.994
- Well, it's obvious, isn't it?
-Yeah, all right.

03:41.034 --> 03:43.914
When they break camp, they'll use
the North Road to get to Nottingham.

03:43.954 --> 03:45.474
Why is he coming?

03:45.514 --> 03:48.314
He's visiting all the nobles throughout
England to grease their palms.

03:48.354 --> 03:51.274
He's trying to buy their loyalty
before King Richard returns, isn't he?

03:51.314 --> 03:54.474
- What, he thinks it can be bought?
- He knows it can.

03:54.514 --> 03:56.874
He's buying the nobles and
their men to seize the throne

03:56.914 --> 03:59.234
so that King Richard returns
to King John's England.

03:59.274 --> 04:01.834
Every noble he buys will
bring us closer to civil war,

04:01.874 --> 04:06.474
and a war between Prince John and King
Richard will tear this country apart.

04:06.514 --> 04:09.874
If he's going to buy them,
he'll be carrying gold.

04:12.154 --> 04:13.874
More than a little.

04:16.274 --> 04:18.154
Well...

04:18.194 --> 04:21.793
we stop him stealing the
crown by stealing his gold.

04:24.714 --> 04:25.714
This is mad...

04:25.754 --> 04:27.674
Yes, it is. Utterly mad!

04:27.714 --> 04:29.194
He'll have a small army with him.

04:29.234 --> 04:32.314
Right. Our only advantage is surprise.

04:32.354 --> 04:34.994
The best place to launch an attack

04:35.034 --> 04:38.954
is here, outside Locksley, so you're
going to have to find more men.

04:38.994 --> 04:41.154
Let's do it.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.194
Gisborne?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.954
- Gisborne!
- My lord.

04:56.994 --> 04:59.314
You're here. I've been looking for you.

04:59.354 --> 05:03.434
I've, er...been thinking
about our relationship.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.154
We should work on it, don't you think?

05:07.194 --> 05:12.074
It's been a little strained
in the past, I admit...

05:14.074 --> 05:17.514
...but in the light of
Prince John's visit...well,

05:17.554 --> 05:22.234
I think unity is the best way forward.

05:23.794 --> 05:26.794
Unity between you and me, hmm?

05:27.834 --> 05:30.674
Standing strong,
together, don't you think?

05:35.354 --> 05:40.754
The past is the past. We
should leave it behind us.

05:40.794 --> 05:46.234
The man is a tyrant, Gisborne, we
both know that, and he's dangerous.

05:46.274 --> 05:49.554
The only way we're
going to survive is...

05:51.114 --> 05:52.594
...unity.

06:03.794 --> 06:05.474
I hope I'm not interrupting.

06:05.514 --> 06:08.154
No. No, not at all.

06:08.194 --> 06:10.714
Me and your brother were
just having a nice little...

06:10.754 --> 06:12.474
philosophical chat.

06:12.514 --> 06:14.474
Yeah, about the past...

06:14.514 --> 06:16.754
and the future.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.794
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, yes.

06:18.834 --> 06:22.034
You've been invited to the
nobles' supper tomorrow evening

06:22.074 --> 06:23.434
with Prince John, so...

06:23.474 --> 06:25.994
try and make yourself
a little entertaining.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.554
Unity.

06:40.194 --> 06:43.674
ROBIN: We need your
help and you know us.

06:43.714 --> 06:46.274
We fight for England and
we fight for King Richard.

06:46.314 --> 06:48.394
We must stop Prince John, we must!

06:48.434 --> 06:50.754
So let's steal his gold
and thwart his ambition!

06:50.794 --> 06:52.914
He's a pretender and not our King.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.594
This is not treason. Help us!

07:12.794 --> 07:15.194
Good shot. Look out!

07:59.394 --> 08:00.914
Hello.

08:00.954 --> 08:03.194
Good God! We've captured Prince John!

08:03.714 --> 08:05.714
Come here!

08:07.514 --> 08:09.874
I'd be very grateful if
you might spare my life.

08:10.954 --> 08:12.354
The gold!

08:12.394 --> 08:13.874
Let's go.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.874
This has to be the gold!

08:18.434 --> 08:19.834
Nothing.

08:20.874 --> 08:22.634
Absolutely nothing!

08:22.674 --> 08:25.554
Well, Prince John is a coward.

08:25.594 --> 08:28.914
If this were Prince John, his
soldiers wouldn't desert him.

08:28.954 --> 08:31.514
He'd try and buy our
allegiance. This is his double!

08:31.554 --> 08:33.034
Where's Kate?

08:35.554 --> 08:37.073
Kate!

08:41.874 --> 08:43.914
Kate! Kate!

08:43.953 --> 08:45.834
Kate.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.874
I'll be all right.

08:48.874 --> 08:50.394
Kate!

08:59.874 --> 09:02.994
Lay her down. Come on,
give her some space.

09:13.914 --> 09:16.034
What is it?

09:16.074 --> 09:19.474
If I remove it, the bleeding could
kill her. It could cause more damage.

09:19.514 --> 09:23.434
I need the bark of an elm tree and
some nettles to grind. Go, please.

09:25.394 --> 09:28.714
A poultice? Quite effective.

09:28.754 --> 09:31.874
It draws out the evils while
keeping the wound clean.

09:33.874 --> 09:37.794
- What are you doing?
- To leave it in would kill her.

09:37.834 --> 09:41.594
I shall will the blood back into her
body while you prepare the poultice,

09:41.634 --> 09:44.114
then we'll need to
rebalance her humours.

09:44.154 --> 09:45.354
Who are you?

09:45.394 --> 09:48.234
Benjamin Palmer
- physician to Prince John.

09:51.394 --> 09:55.154
But neither his supporter
nor his apologist.

10:00.194 --> 10:03.674
Two soldiers reported seeing
assassins in the forest.

10:03.714 --> 10:07.274
The Prince needed a double
- he couldn't cancel his dinner

10:07.314 --> 10:10.074
with the council of nobles tomorrow
- and there was no-one else.

10:10.114 --> 10:13.194
I could have refused, but
I'd have been beheaded.

10:13.234 --> 10:15.114
Mind you,

10:15.154 --> 10:18.074
my predecessor was beheaded because
he couldn't find a case of scrofula.

10:18.114 --> 10:19.834
And what's scrofula?

10:19.874 --> 10:23.194
- It's a very rare disease.
- So rare, I can't find a case, either.

10:23.234 --> 10:25.314
Legend says it can only be
cured by the touch of a king.

10:25.354 --> 10:27.314
So why would he want
to find a case of it?

10:27.354 --> 10:29.674
Prince John's obsessed with it.

10:29.714 --> 10:33.074
He once saw his father, Henry,
successfully cure a child with scrofula.

10:33.114 --> 10:35.994
- My father told me that when I was a kid.
- I heard it, as well.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.514
Prince John brought me with him

10:37.554 --> 10:40.874
hoping I might find a case of scrofula
for him to cure, like his father did,

10:40.914 --> 10:44.874
to prove that he's the rightful King
of England, not his brother Richard.

10:44.914 --> 10:49.474
Of course, there's absolutely no evidence
that a king's touch cures anything.

10:49.514 --> 10:53.794
But as I'd like to keep my head,
I... I'll not be the one to tell him.

10:55.794 --> 10:57.434
Can I have some water, please?

10:57.474 --> 10:59.034
- I'll get it.
- I'll go.

11:03.074 --> 11:04.394
Here you go.

11:05.474 --> 11:06.674
Here.

11:11.274 --> 11:14.794
- You're all right.
- Thank you.

11:15.994 --> 11:19.994
Thank you for helping to save
Kate's life. You're free to go.

11:20.034 --> 11:22.634
- Yes, I'm really grateful.
- VERY grateful.

11:22.674 --> 11:26.594
Well, thank you all. Thank
you for not killing me.

11:26.634 --> 11:28.634
So...will you go back to Prince John?

11:28.674 --> 11:31.194
Well, I suppose I should.

11:31.234 --> 11:32.834
Right.

11:32.874 --> 11:34.514
Tie him up.

11:56.234 --> 11:59.314
Welcome to Nottingham, Your Highness.

11:59.354 --> 12:00.994
You're still alive.

12:02.114 --> 12:03.834
Yes, of course.

12:03.874 --> 12:05.274
How surprising.

12:07.114 --> 12:09.834
I don't particularly like surprises.

12:11.634 --> 12:14.554
- What's your name?
- Isabella.

12:14.594 --> 12:17.794
Lovely! Italian or Spanish?

12:17.834 --> 12:19.354
Which do you prefer?

12:33.714 --> 12:34.834
Speak!

12:34.874 --> 12:36.594
Congratulations!

12:36.634 --> 12:38.514
We were ambushed, not you. Your...

12:38.554 --> 12:41.954
Your...your plan worked, Your Highness.
Your brilliance is unsurpassed.

12:41.994 --> 12:44.474
- Who attacked you?
- Robin Hood.

12:47.834 --> 12:48.914
Sir Guy.

12:51.674 --> 12:54.034
Prove your loyalty to me. Rid me of him!

13:23.274 --> 13:25.634
Do you love me, Sheriff?

13:27.514 --> 13:29.074
With all my heart, sire.

13:31.794 --> 13:33.514
Would you give your life for me?

13:35.194 --> 13:36.674
My life? Is that all? Of course.

13:36.714 --> 13:40.194
- Would you take a life for me?
-Even easier to answer.

13:42.514 --> 13:45.954
Gisborne has so disappointed me.

13:47.514 --> 13:49.554
Disappointed us both, sire.

13:50.674 --> 13:53.074
Obedience, loyalty, love -

13:53.114 --> 13:55.354
is it too much to ask?

13:55.394 --> 13:58.074
A king requires all three.

13:58.914 --> 14:03.674
Who is more loyal to me,
Sheriff... you or Gisborne?

14:03.714 --> 14:06.474
Of course, I am, sire.
My loyalty is infinite.

14:06.514 --> 14:09.394
Good. Then prove it to me.

14:09.434 --> 14:13.034
Rid me of Gisborne,
Sheriff, quickly, discreetly.

14:13.074 --> 14:16.994
We don't want to disturb our noble
guests with this messy business.

14:18.034 --> 14:21.194
Kill him for me, Sheriff.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.714
A privilege, sire.

14:53.114 --> 14:54.914
And where were you attacked?

14:54.954 --> 14:57.074
- Near a village.
- SHERIFF: Locksley village.

14:57.114 --> 15:01.354
PALMER: We fought courageously,
but we were dreadfully outnumbered.

15:01.394 --> 15:04.314
No doubt the villagers
helped the outlaws.

15:05.634 --> 15:08.474
PALMER: And eventually, I was captured.

15:08.514 --> 15:11.754
- By Robin Hood himself.
- SHERIFF: Or so he said.

15:11.794 --> 15:16.114
I mean, we've all been proved wrong
in the past, haven't we, Gisborne?

15:16.154 --> 15:21.114
- But this time, Robin Hood was fooled.
- Yes, Your Highness.

15:21.154 --> 15:25.354
Excellent. And was he angry
that I'd made such a fool of him?

15:25.394 --> 15:26.954
Very angry.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.354
- And did he curse us?
- Fulsomely.

15:29.394 --> 15:30.994
Wonderful!

15:37.634 --> 15:39.314
What did he say?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.714
Oh. I...I couldn't, Your Highness.

15:43.754 --> 15:46.994
- Please. Tell me exactly what he said.
- But Your Highness...

15:47.034 --> 15:50.474
- Do you not love me?
- Of course.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.994
Then say.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.874
He called you a coward.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.754
He said only a coward
would have a double.

16:10.034 --> 16:11.994
Arrest him.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.954
With pleasure. And what
shall I charge him with?

16:14.994 --> 16:17.914
Impersonating the Prince Regent.

16:17.954 --> 16:20.794
If it makes any difference,
sire, I didn't agree with him.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.434
Where is this village of Locksley?

16:25.474 --> 16:27.754
I want to see it.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.194
These villagers helped attack me?

16:44.234 --> 16:47.394
Why? They look so lovely.

16:48.714 --> 16:50.554
ISABELLA: Looks like a wedding.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.194
I love weddings!

16:54.554 --> 16:56.674
I shall speak with them.

16:56.714 --> 16:58.194
You'll join me?

17:05.314 --> 17:07.473
They are sad little
creatures, really, aren't they?

17:09.273 --> 17:11.434
I sense disagreement.

17:11.473 --> 17:14.834
- One cannot disagree with one's King.
- King?

17:14.874 --> 17:18.513
You see me as your King?
How delightful of you.

17:18.554 --> 17:21.394
I wish others accepted
me as readily as you do.

17:21.434 --> 17:25.074
Perhaps I've had the good fortune
to know you better than most.

17:25.114 --> 17:26.194
Perhaps.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.234
And perhaps you would like to
get to know me better still?

17:30.914 --> 17:33.354
You'll make me work for my conquest!

17:33.394 --> 17:36.954
Was not France more valuable
because it was fought for?

17:36.994 --> 17:38.834
You make this such good sport!

17:41.834 --> 17:43.994
Hello, young man.

17:44.034 --> 17:45.514
Thank you.

17:45.554 --> 17:47.674
MAN: Would His Highness
give us his blessing?

17:47.714 --> 17:51.994
They would be honoured if you
would bless the bride and groom.

17:52.034 --> 17:53.514
Of course!

17:58.394 --> 18:00.834
PRINCE JOHN: Hah! Are
you the bride and groom?

18:00.874 --> 18:02.314
BOTH: Yes, sir,

18:02.354 --> 18:03.354
Your Highness.

18:03.394 --> 18:05.354
I wish you prosperity and happiness.

18:05.394 --> 18:06.634
Thank you, sir.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.754
I'm so glad I could bring you sun today!

18:27.274 --> 18:31.994
Wait until they're all inside the
church, and then burn it to the ground.

18:36.194 --> 18:37.234
Burn it!

19:23.794 --> 19:25.954
I'll be fine.

19:26.994 --> 19:28.954
You're being very brave.

19:28.994 --> 19:30.834
JOHN: 'We're already too late.'

19:30.874 --> 19:32.314
The gold is in the castle.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.794
Then we'll steal it back.

19:33.834 --> 19:36.874
- It's dangerous.
- It's too dangerous not to.

19:39.514 --> 19:41.234
Prince John's burning Locksley!

19:51.154 --> 19:55.114
You're being punished for
intolerable disloyalty to me,

19:55.154 --> 19:58.154
for harbouring and assisting
Robin Hood and his outlaws.

19:58.194 --> 20:00.394
And may God forgive you!

20:09.634 --> 20:12.874
- To the river, quick!
- More buckets!

20:12.914 --> 20:14.794
We need more water here!

20:14.834 --> 20:16.354
Bring more water!

20:16.394 --> 20:18.674
PRINCE JOHN: No, no, no, no, no!

20:18.714 --> 20:22.554
They're trying to put the fire
out! That's not what I want!

20:22.594 --> 20:25.914
Stop them, the both of you! Go on!

20:28.474 --> 20:31.114
This should be entertaining.

20:31.154 --> 20:33.234
Come on, hurry up! Get the buckets!

20:33.274 --> 20:35.314
Faster!

20:35.354 --> 20:37.394
Bring more water, quickly!

20:37.434 --> 20:39.834
Coming! I've got two here!

20:41.834 --> 20:43.794
Do you want them to love you?

20:43.834 --> 20:46.434
Of course. And I think they do love me.

20:46.474 --> 20:48.834
But I will have respect as well as love.

20:48.874 --> 20:52.234
Any landowner can subjugate his
serf. Only a king can liberate them.

20:52.274 --> 20:56.474
- A benevolent king is loved.
- But I am benevolent.

21:01.914 --> 21:04.634
Everyone over here,
quick. It's spreading.

21:04.674 --> 21:07.474
We need more help! Come on!

21:07.514 --> 21:10.314
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

21:12.314 --> 21:13.754
Go, peasant!

21:34.354 --> 21:36.394
Back off and your lives will be spared!

21:36.434 --> 21:38.074
MAN: I'll kill you, Gisborne!

21:38.114 --> 21:39.514
MAN: Argh!

21:47.954 --> 21:49.474
(Oh, bother.)

21:50.994 --> 21:52.514
Back off!

22:13.514 --> 22:15.314
Bored now.

22:15.354 --> 22:17.514
Make sure it's burned to the ground.

22:22.434 --> 22:25.354
I love the refusal before the surrender.

22:54.114 --> 22:55.154
Come on!

22:57.594 --> 23:00.274
Come on! Come on, let's go!

23:02.354 --> 23:05.114
- ISABELLA: Take this.
- ROBIN: You're a Gisborne.

23:05.154 --> 23:07.954
You should be burning it down, not
trying to save it, shouldn't you?

23:07.994 --> 23:09.914
I judge people by what I find.

23:48.874 --> 23:51.754
Isabella. Here.

23:55.674 --> 24:00.474
Well...there's nothing about you
that resembles your brother, is there?

24:00.514 --> 24:03.234
There's nothing about
my brother I wish to be.

24:03.274 --> 24:04.514
I hate him.

24:05.514 --> 24:07.674
I will always hate him.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.034
Well, that's something
we share, then, isn't it?

24:10.074 --> 24:11.834
Hatred.

24:11.874 --> 24:15.994
That's nothing to be proud
of, is it? To share hatred?

24:22.994 --> 24:26.074
- Robin!
- I'll catch you up.

24:26.114 --> 24:27.754
Right.

24:27.794 --> 24:30.474
- Come on, let's go.
- ROBIN: So...

24:31.794 --> 24:34.714
...will you go back to Nottingham?

24:34.754 --> 24:36.474
To ruin my brother.

24:36.514 --> 24:39.834
Right. Well, you know where
I am if you need my help, eh?

24:39.874 --> 24:43.154
You're Robin Hood. Shouldn't you
be robbing me, not helping me?

24:46.354 --> 24:47.634
Yeah, you're right. I am.

24:49.274 --> 24:51.354
Give me your necklace.

24:51.394 --> 24:52.874
You're robbing me?!

24:59.754 --> 25:01.754
I like this necklace.

25:03.394 --> 25:05.234
- Are you going to help me?
- Help you?

25:05.274 --> 25:07.874
- This is not the way to go about it.
- Give me your rings.

25:07.914 --> 25:09.514
There.

25:11.554 --> 25:14.874
Because you don't want Prince John
to think you co-operated, do you?

25:14.914 --> 25:17.994
- Anything else you
might want? - Mm-hm.

25:18.034 --> 25:21.994
I want to undermine Prince John's claim
to be the legitimate King of England

25:22.034 --> 25:24.714
and humiliate his ambition,

25:24.754 --> 25:26.674
and I'm prepared to die to stop him.

25:26.714 --> 25:30.154
- You might be more effective alive.
- Will you help me?

25:31.594 --> 25:32.994
Yes.

25:41.074 --> 25:43.594
Give this to the people of Locksley.

25:43.634 --> 25:45.794
Help them rebuild their church.

25:46.794 --> 25:48.514
So you defy Prince John?

25:48.554 --> 25:50.994
He begs my defiance.

25:55.714 --> 25:57.154
So...

25:57.194 --> 25:59.874
is there anything else

25:59.914 --> 26:01.874
that I might steal?

26:01.914 --> 26:03.874
Perhaps.

26:21.514 --> 26:23.714
Stop, thief.

26:39.314 --> 26:40.874
It's nice.

26:41.914 --> 26:44.314
She said she can help us.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.914
Look, I can get you into the castle.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.914
You want us to trust her with our lives?

26:49.954 --> 26:52.594
- Gisborne's sister?!
- Yes!

26:53.794 --> 26:56.194
I trust her with mine.

26:56.234 --> 26:59.434
All right, so she gets us
in the castle. Then what?

26:59.474 --> 27:02.114
Then we get captured
and, I presume, killed.

27:04.474 --> 27:06.914
The king's evil!

27:06.954 --> 27:08.354
The PRINCE, Tuck.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.394
- The PRINCE is evil.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

27:11.434 --> 27:14.394
Prince John is searching
for a victim of scrofula.

27:15.594 --> 27:19.554
So that he can repeat that same feat,
prove his divine right to the throne.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.634
We give him a victim.
I can make a potion

27:21.674 --> 27:25.674
which brings out red blisters on the
neck which looks exactly like scrofula.

27:25.714 --> 27:28.394
So the nobles assemble
in the great hall,

27:28.434 --> 27:31.074
in comes Prince John with this victim,

27:31.114 --> 27:32.794
- he touches him...
- Fails.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.354
..then we humiliate him.

27:34.394 --> 27:36.674
Which distracts the nobles
while we steal the gold!

27:36.714 --> 27:38.594
That might work.

27:39.394 --> 27:41.994
ROBIN: Right. Isabella can get us in.

27:42.034 --> 27:45.554
And Allan, you know the
castle better than anyone.

27:45.594 --> 27:47.834
- You can get us out.
- There's a trap door in the cloisters.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.434
If we lower a rope down,

27:49.474 --> 27:51.794
we can get into a tunnel that
leads directly out of the castle.

27:51.834 --> 27:55.074
- We won't even be seen.
- So come on, what do we think?

27:55.114 --> 27:56.554
Can we convince Prince John?

27:58.514 --> 28:01.714
Benjamin Palmer, the physician.

28:01.754 --> 28:04.794
We helped him. He owes us.
He'll convince Prince John.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.874
Isabella, you should know him.

28:06.914 --> 28:09.954
If he's part of the Prince's
entourage, you can get to him.

28:09.994 --> 28:12.674
No, he's due to be executed tomorrow.

28:12.714 --> 28:16.754
Well, there's no reason why he
shouldn't help us, then, is there?

28:16.794 --> 28:18.554
I won't fail you.

28:20.114 --> 28:22.234
Any of you.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.514
We, er...still need a victim.

28:27.554 --> 28:28.634
I'll do it.

28:28.674 --> 28:29.794
No.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.874
You can't. You're not well enough.

28:31.914 --> 28:34.514
- I'll be fine.
- Kate, it's too dangerous.

28:34.554 --> 28:36.314
He set fire to our church.

28:36.354 --> 28:38.274
He intended to kill everyone.

28:38.314 --> 28:40.434
Besides...

28:41.474 --> 28:43.234
...I already look half dead.

28:44.234 --> 28:45.834
It's perfect.

28:49.034 --> 28:51.034
Send for the groom!

29:02.434 --> 29:04.514
They are beasts!

29:04.554 --> 29:06.394
Robin Hood and his outlaws -

29:06.434 --> 29:09.034
they've robbed me, stole my jewellery.

29:09.074 --> 29:12.154
Look at me! I was so scared.

29:12.194 --> 29:15.594
- PRINCE JOHN: Lovely, isn't she?
- GISBORNE: You should have come with us.

29:15.634 --> 29:17.674
Her brother will be
dead before supper, yes?

29:17.714 --> 29:20.834
Well, I wouldn't set a
place for him myself, sire.

29:20.874 --> 29:23.314
Have her brought to me.

29:26.554 --> 29:31.194
...then I took the sword in my
hand and tugged it from its sheath.

29:36.514 --> 29:40.554
And I put the sword to the
soft part of his throat.

29:40.594 --> 29:42.314
And?

29:42.354 --> 29:44.954
Dozens of outlaws
appeared from nowhere...

29:46.514 --> 29:48.154
..and I shouted,

29:48.194 --> 29:51.194
"Long live King John!"

29:52.434 --> 29:56.154
Oh, you adorable girl.
Everyone, leave us!

30:10.714 --> 30:14.834
You spoke to them - the villagers
- as you tried to put out the fire?

30:14.874 --> 30:16.394
Yes.

30:16.434 --> 30:20.434
Why do the people not love
me as you love me, Isabella?

30:20.474 --> 30:23.474
You burned their church to
the ground with them in it.

30:24.514 --> 30:26.434
Yes. And?

30:27.994 --> 30:30.834
The people want to
love you as their King.

30:32.074 --> 30:37.034
If you can prove your divine right to
the nobles, then the people will follow.

30:37.074 --> 30:39.794
- Do you think?
- Yes...

30:39.834 --> 30:41.394
King John.

30:43.594 --> 30:45.514
Oh, you adorable girl.

30:47.514 --> 30:49.434
Say it again.

30:50.554 --> 30:53.114
KING John.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.274
It does sound good.

30:58.514 --> 31:00.314
It is my divine right.

31:00.354 --> 31:02.434
You must prove it to everyone.

31:11.874 --> 31:14.634
- You are going to help me.
- Am I?

31:14.674 --> 31:18.954
The Sheriff is going to execute you.
This is your last chance to save yourself.

31:18.994 --> 31:21.834
You've convinced me. 
PRINCE JOHN: Where is he?!

31:23.154 --> 31:25.434
Our prayers have been answered, sire.

31:25.474 --> 31:28.154
Has he really found a victim
of the disease? Really?

31:28.194 --> 31:32.314
He saw a woman in Locksley.
I couldn't believe my ears.

31:32.354 --> 31:34.634
Is it true?

31:34.674 --> 31:36.234
Yes.

31:36.274 --> 31:38.154
This is so exciting!

31:38.194 --> 31:42.594
I saw the poor, pitiful woman
when Robin Hood held me captive.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.354
I was sure it was scrofula.

31:44.394 --> 31:46.114
Why didn't you tell me?

31:46.154 --> 31:49.914
Because you put me... Because
the Sheriff put me in this cage.

31:49.954 --> 31:53.874
What does the Sheriff think he's
doing? The man is my physician!

31:53.914 --> 31:55.834
Are you sure it's scrofula?

31:55.874 --> 31:57.874
Yes.

31:59.114 --> 32:02.154
Completely and utterly certain.

32:03.714 --> 32:07.034
The nobles will have their proof
of my divine right to be King.

32:08.114 --> 32:12.274
Physician, you will bring
this woman to me tonight.

32:12.314 --> 32:14.154
In front of all the nobles...

32:15.194 --> 32:20.074
..I will cure her and prove
myself their rightful King!

32:31.394 --> 32:34.154
He's given each of the
nobles a casket full of gold,

32:34.194 --> 32:36.914
too much to carry on their person
- it will be in their rooms.

32:36.954 --> 32:39.314
- There will be five trumpet fanfares.
- Five.

32:39.354 --> 32:41.994
On the fifth, you have
to be ready to escape.

32:42.034 --> 32:44.874
- And I'll make a distraction.
- Five. Good.

32:44.914 --> 32:47.754
Kate, drink this. The marks
will be gone by tomorrow.

32:49.914 --> 32:51.394
Kate?

33:17.194 --> 33:20.234
- Thank you for helping us.
-You're welcome.

33:21.354 --> 33:27.114
Kate, after the fifth blast,
be ready for my signal.

33:28.194 --> 33:31.834
You need to follow Kate, all right?
We'll escape together, don't worry.

33:31.874 --> 33:34.434
- We won't leave you behind.
- Very optimistic.

33:53.714 --> 33:55.354
Where's this trap door?

33:55.394 --> 33:58.034
- I think it's down here.
- You think?

33:58.074 --> 33:59.514
Yeah.

34:06.874 --> 34:08.514
Was that the second fanfare?

34:09.554 --> 34:10.873
Good luck.

34:14.074 --> 34:16.274
Bring the poor, afflicted woman forward.

34:27.393 --> 34:30.833
This woman has scrofula...

34:32.514 --> 34:35.914
the king's evil,

34:35.954 --> 34:39.154
and can only be cured
by the touch of a king!

34:46.074 --> 34:51.114
I shall now lay my hands
upon this young woman,

34:51.154 --> 34:57.594
cure her of her affliction
and save her life.

34:57.634 --> 35:02.514
When she is cured, Prince John will be
revealed, like his father before him,

35:02.554 --> 35:05.594
to be the rightful King of England.

35:07.434 --> 35:12.514
I command you now, in the name of all
things holy, to leave this body now

35:12.554 --> 35:14.554
and never to return!

35:31.194 --> 35:32.674
Gisborne.

35:34.274 --> 35:35.994
What are you doing here?

36:03.914 --> 36:06.234
You represent everything
that's loathsome in a man!

36:06.274 --> 36:07.994
I thought that's why you liked me.

36:08.034 --> 36:09.874
I was always fond of you, Gisborne.

36:10.554 --> 36:13.114
Not overly fond...but fond.

36:38.714 --> 36:41.474
Has the disease been cured?

36:47.314 --> 36:49.394
No, sire.

36:49.434 --> 36:51.794
The woman is not cured.

36:53.954 --> 36:56.554
How can this be?

36:58.554 --> 37:00.234
How can this be?!

37:08.034 --> 37:11.714
Did Prince John put you up to this?

37:11.754 --> 37:14.594
He asked me to kill you.
Do you hear me, Gisborne?

37:14.634 --> 37:17.834
This is nothing but sport for him...

37:19.634 --> 37:22.594
..putting us up against each other.

37:22.634 --> 37:24.634
Unity, Gisborne!

37:25.234 --> 37:27.274
- Argh!
- This isn't for Prince John.

37:30.314 --> 37:32.594
This is for me!

37:36.394 --> 37:37.874
I will be rid of you.

37:39.274 --> 37:41.674
Please, I beg you...

37:41.714 --> 37:43.274
have mercy on me.

37:43.314 --> 37:45.754
You have no idea how much
pleasure this is going to give me.

37:45.794 --> 37:48.314
You're going to die slowly

37:48.354 --> 37:51.274
and I'm going to watch the venom
drain from your body as you die.

37:51.314 --> 37:56.354
Gisborne, please, don't
disgrace me. Kill me quickly.

38:00.714 --> 38:01.874
Argh!

38:05.114 --> 38:06.394
Argh!

38:12.794 --> 38:16.474
Humanity is a weakness, Gisborne.
It's always been your failing.

38:16.514 --> 38:18.834
I tried to teach you.

38:20.794 --> 38:23.034
That's five. We'd better go.

38:23.074 --> 38:26.274
I order you to be cured!

38:28.274 --> 38:30.554
I order you to be cured!

38:32.034 --> 38:34.234
Oh, good Lord! It can't be!

38:34.274 --> 38:35.954
What is it?

38:37.074 --> 38:39.394
- Robin Hood!
- Benjamin, the door!

38:39.434 --> 38:42.154
Get him! Get him!

38:42.194 --> 38:44.114
GUARD: After them!

38:45.994 --> 38:48.314
- They're coming.
- Quick!

38:48.354 --> 38:51.714
- Kate, come on!
- Take that. Down you go.

38:51.754 --> 38:53.794
As quick as you can. You're next.

38:56.234 --> 38:58.274
You're the reason Marian is dead.

38:58.314 --> 39:00.954
- You poison everything!
- All this for a woman?

39:08.434 --> 39:09.794
Aaargh!

39:22.754 --> 39:24.514
I've enjoyed your company.

39:35.074 --> 39:37.074
Gisborne...

39:50.554 --> 39:51.674
Aargh!

39:51.714 --> 39:54.114
You know, I loved you like a son.

39:55.554 --> 39:57.794
And you loved me like a father once.

39:59.114 --> 40:00.154
I know you did.

40:02.794 --> 40:03.994
Aargh!

40:10.154 --> 40:11.874
You dropped something.

40:34.194 --> 40:35.394
Gisborne...

40:37.234 --> 40:39.194
...don't trust him.

40:40.194 --> 40:42.514
Do you hear me?

40:45.674 --> 40:49.234
Nothing...is what it seems.

41:05.594 --> 41:09.234
(SLURRING) I pray you
will remember my generosity

41:09.274 --> 41:11.194
and my gifts to you all.

41:12.594 --> 41:15.754
All I ask for in return

41:15.794 --> 41:19.074
is your loyalty and your love.

41:25.914 --> 41:28.754
It wasn't scrofula.
It couldn't have been.

41:28.794 --> 41:30.354
Of course not, sire.

41:33.474 --> 41:34.914
Say it.

41:36.274 --> 41:38.234
Like you did before. Say it.

41:40.354 --> 41:42.234
King John.

41:44.674 --> 41:46.474
It does sound good.

42:13.714 --> 42:15.234
It is with great sadness

42:15.274 --> 42:20.354
that I must announce the death
of the Sheriff of Nottingham.

42:21.594 --> 42:26.474
He has been murdered by
the villainous Robin Hood.

42:26.514 --> 42:28.874
These outlaws must be stopped!

42:31.314 --> 42:33.914
Long live Prince John!

42:35.474 --> 42:37.874
ALL: Long live Prince John!

42:39.234 --> 42:41.474
Long live me.

42:50.834 --> 42:53.554
Tell me all about it.

42:58.714 --> 43:00.034
Come on!

43:31.634 --> 43:35.114
Within the hour every well within
a ten-mile radius will be dry!

43:35.154 --> 43:36.714
Nothing. I'm sorry.

43:36.754 --> 43:39.434
You like my water so much,
from now on, you pay for it!

43:39.474 --> 43:46.034
My lords and ladies, I give you, Sir Guy
of Gisborne, the new Sheriff of Nottingham.

43:46.074 --> 43:48.034
You're a dead man walking, Gisborne!

43:48.074 --> 43:51.954
She's Gisborne's sister! You think
she doesn't have ulterior motives?!

43:51.994 --> 43:54.154
- Guy, what are you doing?
- Executing a traitor...

43:54.194 --> 43:56.874
and his accomplice.
You're both going to drown.
