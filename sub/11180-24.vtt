WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.314
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.452 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.804 --> 00:14.738
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.876 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.538
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.540 --> 00:26.026
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.164 --> 00:28.718
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.856 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.410 --> 00:34.034
Just to get up that hill

00:34.172 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.142
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.280 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.187
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.325 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.611
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.749 --> 01:04.995
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.414 --> 01:11.933
George, I must confess.
I'm really impressed.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.625
You're being
a wonderful husband.

01:13.763 --> 01:16.283
Just because I'm giving
Weezy a surprise
birthday party?

01:16.421 --> 01:18.319
What's wonderful is you
remember the date.

01:18.457 --> 01:19.700
Half the time
I forget,

01:19.838 --> 01:21.840
and Helen has to
remind me it's
her birthday.

01:21.978 --> 01:23.255
Isn't that right,
dear?

01:23.393 --> 01:25.119
You're
exaggerating, Tom.

01:25.257 --> 01:27.501
I have to remind you
all the time.

01:29.227 --> 01:30.435
Ooh, that's not
Louise, is it?

01:30.573 --> 01:31.919
No, no. she's still
at the doctor's

01:32.057 --> 01:33.403
getting her
yearly checkup.

01:33.541 --> 01:35.095
Now, look,
the main thing is

01:35.233 --> 01:37.442
keeping tonight's
surprise party a secret
for Weezy's sake.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.409
Because being surprised
is all of the fun.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.619
What's wrong
with you?

01:42.757 --> 01:44.034
Surprise!
Hello, everyone!

01:44.173 --> 01:45.588
HELEN:
Hi, Mr. Bentley.

01:45.726 --> 01:47.417
Wait till you see
what I have for
the party, Mr. J.

01:47.555 --> 01:49.143
I know, it's
a bag full of
them things.

01:49.281 --> 01:50.627
Uh, yes, and some
of these too!

01:52.940 --> 01:54.010
We can talk about
the toys later.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.253
Right now I'm trying
to figure out a way

01:55.391 --> 01:56.840
to keep this whole
thing a secret.

01:56.978 --> 01:58.842
Do you think it's smart
meeting here like this?

01:58.980 --> 02:00.982
If Louise came in
and saw all of us here
on her birthday,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.467
she'll know that...

02:02.605 --> 02:04.710
That's where the old
Jefferson brain
takes over.

02:04.848 --> 02:06.333
There ain't no way
in the world Weezy's
gonna find out

02:06.471 --> 02:08.058
that we're having
a surprise party
for her tonight.

02:08.197 --> 02:10.268
Why not?
Because her birthday
ain't till next Tuesday.

02:12.339 --> 02:14.375
Ah, isn't this
jolly fun?

02:15.894 --> 02:16.964
Hey, Bentley, please!

02:17.102 --> 02:18.103
Look, I'm having enough
trouble thinking about

02:18.241 --> 02:19.656
all the things
I gotta do today.

02:19.794 --> 02:21.106
And you ain't
making it no easier.

02:21.244 --> 02:22.521
I've still gotta
get over to the jewelers

02:22.659 --> 02:23.971
and pick up
Weezy's present.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.800
Then I gotta get
all that stuff
from the market.

02:25.938 --> 02:27.595
Then I gotta find
an excuse to get Weezy

02:27.733 --> 02:30.115
to go up to
your apartment without her
getting suspicious.

02:31.668 --> 02:33.429
Well, why don't you
just say you're lonely,

02:33.567 --> 02:35.155
you Miss your dear friends
the Willises,

02:35.293 --> 02:36.949
and you'd like to
drop up for a drink?

02:38.019 --> 02:39.883
You weren't listening,
Mr. Bentley.

02:40.021 --> 02:42.610
It's got to be
something that won't
make her suspicious.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.511
You ever see
anything so goofy
in all your life?

02:48.444 --> 02:49.445
Yeah, I'm looking
at it.

02:51.826 --> 02:54.001
Bentley!
Now, where were we?

02:54.139 --> 02:55.727
Well, we were
talking about a pretense

02:55.865 --> 02:58.350
to get Louise
up to our apartment
for the party.

02:58.488 --> 03:00.283
A-ha! I have it.

03:00.421 --> 03:02.837
Mrs. Willis, you could
phone Mrs. Jefferson

03:02.975 --> 03:05.323
and tell her that
your husband dropped
his pen behind his desk,

03:05.461 --> 03:07.014
and while stooping
to retrieve it,

03:07.152 --> 03:08.878
gave his noggin
such a nasty knock

03:09.016 --> 03:10.569
he was rendered
unconscious.

03:10.707 --> 03:13.538
And that you require
assistance in moving him
to the bedroom.

03:13.676 --> 03:15.125
An emergency
situation like that

03:15.264 --> 03:18.059
precludes any hesitation
on the part of Mrs. Jefferson.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.889
Isn't that
a splendid notion?

03:20.338 --> 03:21.615
It stinks.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.342
You're right.
It would never work.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.654
I've got
a better idea.
Good.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.656
We'll just give you
the key to our apartment

03:28.794 --> 03:29.933
and let you
think up something.

03:30.071 --> 03:31.487
Oh!

03:31.625 --> 03:33.523
You can always
come up with
some kind of fish story.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.698
He's been telling
them for years.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.909
Well, how's
the party
planning coming?

03:40.047 --> 03:42.187
It was going good
up until now.

03:42.325 --> 03:45.086
I just want to know one thing.
Am I invited to this party?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.467
Of course you are.

03:46.605 --> 03:48.469
I didn't hear Mr. Jefferson
say I was.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.954
Florence, look, when I first
got the idea for the party,

03:51.092 --> 03:52.439
you was the first one
I thought of.

03:52.577 --> 03:54.958
I mean, just like
a friend of Weezy,
you deserve to be there.

03:55.096 --> 03:56.684
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Jefferson.

03:56.822 --> 03:58.099
And besides, you gotta
serve the cake and the punch,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.618
and clean up
the mess afterwards.

04:01.965 --> 04:04.313
Forgive him, lord.
Remember, he's your fault.

04:10.698 --> 04:13.287
That reminds me.
Helen, did you
order the cake?

04:13.425 --> 04:16.117
Uh-huh, from that
wonderful German bakery
on 86th street.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.809
We can pick it up
this afternoon.

04:17.947 --> 04:20.260
Oh, and I've got some
very important things
to pick up too.

04:20.398 --> 04:21.468
Like what?

04:21.606 --> 04:24.091
Oh, some confetti,
some serpentines,

04:24.229 --> 04:25.920
and six more of
these little fellas.

04:28.716 --> 04:29.924
Well, since
everybody else

04:30.062 --> 04:32.202
is contributing something,
I'm gonna do my part.

04:32.341 --> 04:34.135
Your part is to run
over to the gourmet shop

04:34.274 --> 04:36.241
and pick up the champagne
and hors d'oeuvres.

04:36.379 --> 04:37.760
I mean
at the party.

04:37.898 --> 04:41.591
I'm gonna sing
"O promise me."

04:41.729 --> 04:43.490
But isn't that
sung at weddings?

04:43.628 --> 04:45.077
Yeah, but I only know
two songs by heart.

04:45.215 --> 04:47.356
The other one is
"What a friend
we have in Jesus."

04:50.255 --> 04:52.015
Sing "O promise me."

04:53.189 --> 04:55.260
Oh, promise me
you won't sing at all.

04:57.883 --> 04:58.815
GEORGE: Weezy!

04:58.953 --> 05:00.472
ALL: Oh!

05:03.820 --> 05:05.166
Damn that woman.

05:06.478 --> 05:08.135
Weezy, how come
you're home so soon?

05:08.273 --> 05:09.999
The doctor had
a cancellation,

05:10.137 --> 05:11.414
and he took me
earlier.

05:12.277 --> 05:13.589
What's going on here?

05:13.727 --> 05:16.764
Going on?
Why, we were just,
um, uh...

05:16.902 --> 05:18.663
Tell her, Helen.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.114
We were
having a tenants'
committee meeting.

05:22.252 --> 05:23.702
Yes.
About what?

05:23.840 --> 05:26.774
About what?
Uh...tell her, Tom.

05:26.912 --> 05:28.086
Um...

05:28.224 --> 05:31.607
Uh, Louise,
how was your checkup
at the doctor's?

05:31.745 --> 05:33.229
Oh, all right,
I guess.

05:33.367 --> 05:34.541
Is everything
okay?

05:34.679 --> 05:35.956
Fine, George.
Fine.

05:36.612 --> 05:37.544
What's this?

05:37.682 --> 05:39.304
Uh...
Oh, that's my kazoo.

05:39.442 --> 05:41.686
I brought it
with me to the
tenants' meeting.

05:41.824 --> 05:42.790
Why?

05:42.928 --> 05:44.930
Why. Why?

05:45.068 --> 05:47.312
Uh, because from
time immemorial,

05:47.450 --> 05:49.797
the kazoo has been
the instrument
of protest.

05:49.935 --> 05:51.143
I mean, listen...

05:54.871 --> 05:56.701
Now, hearing that,
wouldn't you protest?

05:57.943 --> 06:00.256
Music has the power
to stir men's souls,

06:00.394 --> 06:03.086
and this kazoo shall lead
the tenants to victory.

06:11.060 --> 06:14.443
Mr. Bentley...
Quit while
you're ahead.

06:15.961 --> 06:17.342
Where are you going,
Weezy?

06:17.480 --> 06:18.930
To get an aspirin.

06:19.068 --> 06:21.346
See that, Bentley?
Your kazooing gave
Weezy a headache.

06:21.484 --> 06:23.935
You go ahead with
your meeting.
Don't worry about me.

06:24.073 --> 06:25.799
You heard Weezy.
Keep the meeting going.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.836
Well, I've always, uh,
taken the position

06:28.974 --> 06:30.838
that the management
of this building

06:30.976 --> 06:32.702
has been extremely lax
in many areas...

06:32.840 --> 06:34.394
Tom, they're in the
kitchen now.

06:34.532 --> 06:36.223
Right. Let's get
out of here!

06:36.361 --> 06:38.605
No, if we
leave now, Louise
might get suspicious.

06:38.743 --> 06:41.504
Right.
Let's stay.

06:41.642 --> 06:44.024
So I feel
the only way to handle
these problems is...

06:44.162 --> 06:45.750
Tom?
Yes?

06:45.888 --> 06:47.165
Shut up.

06:49.650 --> 06:50.927
Here, these will
make you feel better.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.413
No, it won't.

06:56.692 --> 07:00.143
There's something
you ain't telling me,
ain't there, Weezy?

07:00.281 --> 07:02.180
You're worried about
what that doctor said,
ain't you?

07:02.318 --> 07:03.802
He scared me
to death.

07:05.079 --> 07:06.356
Is it real bad?

07:07.185 --> 07:08.428
Awful.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.396
Then you gotta
tell me, Weezy.

07:11.534 --> 07:13.950
No matter how bad it is,
I can take it.

07:15.124 --> 07:16.194
What did
the doctor say?

07:17.091 --> 07:18.438
He said...

07:18.576 --> 07:21.613
I'll probably
live to be 100.

07:21.751 --> 07:23.097
Oh, my god!

07:26.273 --> 07:27.619
I knew it.

07:29.656 --> 07:31.036
Wait a minute.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.382
What did you say again?

07:34.212 --> 07:36.386
He said I'm in
perfect health.

07:36.525 --> 07:39.528
Did you ever hear
of anything so terrible?

07:40.908 --> 07:42.669
Look, the terrible thing
is him telling you

07:42.807 --> 07:44.084
you're gonna live
100 years,

07:44.222 --> 07:46.983
then you coming home
and making me scare
myself to death.

07:47.121 --> 07:48.985
George, you don't
understand.

07:49.123 --> 07:51.712
I'm facing
a long, empty life.

07:52.748 --> 07:55.371
Ah! Why didn't you
say so?

07:55.509 --> 07:57.097
Now I know what's
worrying you.

07:57.235 --> 07:59.133
You're scared
you're gonna live
longer than me, right?

08:00.169 --> 08:01.929
Why should I be
afraid of that?

08:03.310 --> 08:06.106
Because I'm fun
to live with.

08:06.244 --> 08:09.523
I mean, let's face it.
I'm the bright spot
in your life, right?

08:09.661 --> 08:12.388
When you wake up
in the morning,
the first thing you see is me.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.424
I mean, what more could
a woman ask for?

08:16.357 --> 08:17.911
That isn't it at all.

08:18.049 --> 08:20.223
It ain't?
No.

08:20.361 --> 08:22.467
Hmm, then what is it?

08:22.605 --> 08:25.919
I'm doing absolutely
nothing with my life.

08:26.057 --> 08:28.300
I don't seem to be
going anywhere.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.336
What are you
talking about, Weezy?

08:29.474 --> 08:30.406
I told you
I'm gonna take you

08:30.544 --> 08:32.373
to Atlantic City
this year.

08:33.409 --> 08:35.135
George, what I mean is

08:35.273 --> 08:37.827
I would like to be doing
something worthwhile.

08:37.965 --> 08:40.416
Being my wife
ain't worthwhile?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.936
Look, you don't
need me anymore.

08:43.074 --> 08:45.214
My son is all
grown up and married.

08:45.352 --> 08:48.597
I don't even clean
my own house.
I don't do anything!

08:48.735 --> 08:50.668
Weezy, look, you worked hard
all your life.

08:50.806 --> 08:52.497
This is your reward.

08:52.635 --> 08:54.982
It's like...
Like being put out to pasture.

09:01.126 --> 09:03.128
I'm not a horse, George.

09:04.923 --> 09:07.512
I'm so tired
of being a nothing.

09:07.650 --> 09:11.309
Hey, how can you
say that, Weezy?
You're something, all right.

09:11.447 --> 09:13.069
I mean, who was it
that got me out of
all that mess

09:13.207 --> 09:14.450
when old Ben
was about to retire?

09:14.588 --> 09:15.934
You.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.109
And who was it
that talked Florence
out of committing suicide

09:18.247 --> 09:19.904
when she was feeling
low and down?

09:20.042 --> 09:21.664
You.

09:21.802 --> 09:23.563
And I work
my tail off all day

09:23.701 --> 09:25.944
and come home uptight
and not fit to deal with.

09:26.082 --> 09:27.636
Who puts up
with me? You.

09:27.774 --> 09:28.706
And just the other day...

09:28.844 --> 09:29.983
Oh, George!

09:30.121 --> 09:31.950
Don't be kissing me
while I'm talking!

09:34.125 --> 09:37.024
Look, there are a lot
of people in this world
that ain't nothing,

09:37.162 --> 09:38.543
but you ain't
one of 'em, Weezy.

09:38.681 --> 09:39.958
Because you are
something.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.926
You through
talking now?

09:42.064 --> 09:43.272
Yeah.

09:45.101 --> 09:46.689
Thanks for
cheering me up.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.208
Good, now you stay
in here and
dry your eyes.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.210
I'm gonna go ahead
and wrap up
this tenant meeting.

09:50.348 --> 09:51.901
I want to
go with you.
No! No! No!

09:52.039 --> 09:53.213
Ain't no need for you
to get involved.

09:53.351 --> 09:55.111
I want to
get involved.

09:57.735 --> 09:58.805
You feeling
all right, Louise?

09:58.943 --> 10:00.979
Much better.
Oh, splendid.

10:01.117 --> 10:03.913
In that case, madam chairman,
I move we adjourn
this meeting.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.121
Oh, wait a second.

10:05.259 --> 10:07.296
I have a second.
All in favor, say aye.

10:09.436 --> 10:10.817
Uh, Mr. Bentley, I...

10:10.955 --> 10:12.612
Ah, the ayes have it.

10:16.167 --> 10:18.583
Wait.
What's this meeting about?

10:18.721 --> 10:20.689
Don't trouble
yourself, Louise.

10:20.827 --> 10:21.966
Oh, but I'd like
to help.

10:22.104 --> 10:24.037
We've got it all
worked out.

10:24.175 --> 10:25.176
You heard her,
Weezy.

10:25.314 --> 10:26.764
Look, you don't need
to get involved.

10:26.902 --> 10:28.835
Oh, yes. We'll take
care of everything.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.560
Oh.

10:30.699 --> 10:33.080
Mr. Bentley, aren't you
needed at the UN.?

10:33.218 --> 10:35.565
Oh, I like to think so,
but sometimes...

10:35.704 --> 10:37.050
Like now?

10:37.188 --> 10:38.741
Oh, um, quite right.

10:38.879 --> 10:40.398
Toodle-pip.

10:41.951 --> 10:44.644
Oh, Tom, Helen,
you don't have to go,
do you?

10:44.782 --> 10:46.231
Oh, oh, yes.
Yes, we do.

10:46.369 --> 10:48.682
You see, we have another
committee meeting to go to.

10:48.820 --> 10:52.168
The Citizens
For Police Brutality.

10:52.306 --> 10:55.516
He means
Citizens Against
Police Brutality.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.208
I'm against that too.
Can I come with you?

10:57.346 --> 10:59.451
Oh, no, no,
that won't be possible.
Why not?

10:59.589 --> 11:02.800
It's a closed meeting
to work out the campaign.

11:02.938 --> 11:04.456
Well, if they need
any volunteers,

11:04.594 --> 11:05.975
I'm willing to do
anything to help.

11:06.113 --> 11:07.908
No, no, we have all
the volunteers we need.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.807
In fact,
we're up to our...
Tom.

11:09.945 --> 11:12.223
What? Oh, yeah.
Well, goodbye, Louise.

11:13.086 --> 11:14.190
Bye.

11:14.328 --> 11:15.329
Well, I'm on my way.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.676
Oh, where are
you going?

11:16.814 --> 11:17.780
To the gourmet shop.

11:17.918 --> 11:19.437
Oh, good.
I'll come with you.

11:19.575 --> 11:20.990
That ain't
necessary.

11:21.922 --> 11:23.752
I know, but I enjoy

11:23.890 --> 11:25.719
browsing up and down
those aisles.

11:25.857 --> 11:27.687
And besides,
it'll go much faster

11:27.825 --> 11:29.309
with two
doing the shopping.

11:29.447 --> 11:31.173
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

11:32.277 --> 11:34.555
Of course,
but I was just thinking...

11:34.694 --> 11:36.557
Well, then, will you
let me do my job?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.457
Your job is telling me
what to do,

11:39.595 --> 11:41.597
and my job
is doing it.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.910
And I don't need nobody
looking over my shoulder.

11:46.084 --> 11:47.534
I'm sorry.

11:48.949 --> 11:50.330
Well, okay.

11:50.468 --> 11:53.402
But you ought to
know by now how
sensitive I am.

12:01.237 --> 12:03.239
Well, bye, Weez.

12:03.377 --> 12:05.310
But, George,
where are you going?

12:05.448 --> 12:07.209
To work.
It's Saturday, ain't it?

12:07.347 --> 12:09.936
But I was hoping we could
do something together.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.420
Why don't you
stay home today?

12:11.558 --> 12:13.698
I can't. I got
a big problem at work.

12:13.836 --> 12:15.424
What kind of
problem?

12:15.562 --> 12:18.047
Um... Rose Johnson.

12:18.185 --> 12:19.877
She's got husband
trouble again.

12:20.015 --> 12:21.085
You mean
he left home?

12:21.223 --> 12:22.465
No, he came back.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.572
She don't know
what to do,

12:25.710 --> 12:27.125
so I'm gonna go up
and give her some advice.

12:27.263 --> 12:30.025
I've known Rose for years.
Let me help.

12:30.163 --> 12:33.235
No, no, no, no.
I want to handle this
Rose business myself.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.754
I don't want you
to get involved.

12:34.892 --> 12:36.963
Look, you just
stay here and
rest up for me, okay.

12:37.101 --> 12:39.620
And your little
bright spot will be
back about 6:00.

12:54.394 --> 12:56.258
Wow, that dinner
was terrific, Weezy.

12:56.396 --> 12:57.500
You know,
you're a great cook.

12:57.638 --> 12:59.640
Mmm-wah!

12:59.779 --> 13:01.884
George... I know
the reason

13:02.022 --> 13:03.852
you gave Florence
the night off.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.163
What?

13:05.301 --> 13:07.131
Oh! Who gave it away?

13:07.269 --> 13:08.822
Was it the Willises?

13:08.960 --> 13:10.928
Why would the Willises
know anything about it?

13:11.066 --> 13:12.067
Because they...

13:12.205 --> 13:13.378
What are you
talking about?

13:15.311 --> 13:17.382
You gave Florence
the night off

13:17.520 --> 13:21.076
because you wanted me
to cook dinner for you
and feel useful again.

13:21.386 --> 13:22.663
What?

13:24.700 --> 13:27.323
That's right.
That's what I did,
all right.

13:27.461 --> 13:30.844
Man, it ain't easy
fooling you, Weezy.

13:30.982 --> 13:33.674
Well, it was nice of you
to try, George,

13:33.813 --> 13:37.126
but I wanna do more
than just be a good cook.

13:37.264 --> 13:39.335
Okay. You wanna
do something different
right now?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.027
Now?

13:41.165 --> 13:42.545
Come and go up to
the Willises'
apartment with me.

13:42.683 --> 13:44.375
Oh, the Willises
don't want me.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.515
They didn't even want me
to go out with them today.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.137
Well, that's good,
'cause they ain't home.

13:48.275 --> 13:50.553
Then why are we
going up there?

13:50.691 --> 13:53.798
Uh...well, Tom asked me
to feed his fish.

13:53.936 --> 13:55.041
Oh.

13:57.388 --> 13:59.252
Hold it!
What is it now?

13:59.390 --> 14:01.219
The Willises
don't have any fish.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.152
They just
bought 'em today.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.914
But why do you
have to feed them?

14:06.052 --> 14:08.192
Because they have
to be fed every
three hours.

14:12.092 --> 14:14.232
Every three hours?

14:14.370 --> 14:16.062
What kind of fish
are they?

14:19.859 --> 14:23.759
It still seems strange
that Tom should ask you
to feed his fish.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.762
Why is it so strange?
I used to work
in a fish market.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.765
Yeah, but those
were dead fish.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.629
Which is what the Willises'
fish are gonna be

14:31.767 --> 14:33.562
if we don't hurry up
and get up there.
Come on.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.184
Well, you'd better
get going.

14:35.322 --> 14:37.428
Weezy!
'Cause I'm not going.

14:49.543 --> 14:50.820
Hello, Willis.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.099
Look, I can't get Weezy
to come up there with me.

14:53.237 --> 14:55.135
What? I gave her
the fish story.

14:55.273 --> 14:56.619
She won't bite.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.968
What? Well... bye.

15:05.145 --> 15:06.319
Who was that?

15:06.457 --> 15:08.804
Wrong number.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.737
Wrong number?
I didn't hear
the phone ring.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.290
It didn't.

15:12.428 --> 15:13.360
Then how could you...

15:13.498 --> 15:15.328
I dialed
the wrong number.

15:15.466 --> 15:17.675
Oh. Who were
you calling?

15:17.813 --> 15:19.642
I can't remember.

15:22.404 --> 15:23.957
You can't remember?

15:24.095 --> 15:27.133
I guess that's why
I got the wrong number.

15:27.271 --> 15:28.410
How could you...
Come on!

15:28.548 --> 15:29.583
You're going up to
the Willises with me.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.551
I said I don't
want to go!

15:31.689 --> 15:33.104
Sure you do.
And if you're good,

15:33.242 --> 15:35.313
I'll let you feed the fish
all by yourself.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.384
Well, I don't feel like
feeding fish!

15:37.522 --> 15:40.284
Okay. I've got
something else that
might give you a lift.

15:40.422 --> 15:41.354
What's that?

15:41.492 --> 15:43.356
A ride up
on the elevator.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.842
The elevator's
going down.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.361
Okay, then, we'll
take the stairs up.

15:48.499 --> 15:49.845
You need
the exercise anyway.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.467
But, George...

15:51.605 --> 15:53.504
Look, Weezy,
if those fish die,
it's gonna be your fault.

15:53.918 --> 15:55.161
Oh, wait...

15:57.542 --> 16:00.614
You know, I have
heard of a floating
crap game before,

16:00.752 --> 16:02.823
but I ain't never
heard of a floating
surprise party.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.792
Shh.
Well, if pop can't bring
mom to the party,

16:05.930 --> 16:07.587
we'll just
have to bring
the party to mom.

16:07.725 --> 16:09.140
Okay.
Okay.

16:09.278 --> 16:11.453
Oh, when I say "three,"
Everybody yell "surprise."

16:11.591 --> 16:13.248
All right.
Okay.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.078
One. Two.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.459
Wait a minute!
What is it?

16:17.597 --> 16:19.116
Perhaps I should
get up in front

16:19.254 --> 16:20.703
so I can get
a really close shot

16:20.841 --> 16:22.533
of Mrs. Jefferson's
surprised face.

16:23.223 --> 16:24.328
TOM: Good idea!

16:24.466 --> 16:25.398
All right.
All right now.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.502
Is everybody
ready?

16:26.640 --> 16:27.538
ALL: Yes.
Okay.

16:27.676 --> 16:29.850
One! Two! Three!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.680
ALL: Surprise!

16:42.760 --> 16:44.037
Surprise?

16:46.384 --> 16:47.627
Surprise.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.770
Well...
Here we are, Weezy!

16:52.908 --> 16:54.289
The Willises'
apartment!

16:57.671 --> 16:59.604
I can see that,
George.

16:59.742 --> 17:01.434
Right!

17:01.572 --> 17:04.299
Louise and George
are here!

17:04.437 --> 17:07.992
Now... I'm gonna
open the door,

17:08.130 --> 17:09.200
and then we're
gonna go in!

17:09.338 --> 17:10.581
Okay?

17:11.237 --> 17:12.583
Okay, George.

17:12.721 --> 17:14.171
Right!

17:14.309 --> 17:15.551
George!

17:15.689 --> 17:17.553
Okay! Here we go!

17:19.762 --> 17:22.006
One! Two!

17:22.144 --> 17:23.352
Three!

17:27.322 --> 17:28.357
LOUISE: We need some light.

17:28.495 --> 17:30.118
GEORGE: No!

17:30.256 --> 17:31.533
Why not?

17:31.671 --> 17:32.672
Oh, uh, well,

17:32.810 --> 17:34.018
the fish will
think it's daytime,

17:34.156 --> 17:35.640
and they'll
want breakfast.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.333
And they ain't
had their dinner yet.

17:40.714 --> 17:43.131
Well. Ha-ha!
Here we are!

17:48.688 --> 17:50.966
What are they,
talking fish?

17:53.555 --> 17:55.074
Well?

17:55.212 --> 17:56.592
Aren't you gonna
feed them?

17:56.730 --> 17:58.077
In a minute,
Weezy.

17:59.492 --> 18:01.735
LOUISE: Oh, George,
you are being ridiculous.

18:04.704 --> 18:05.912
What are you
looking for?

18:06.050 --> 18:07.810
Uh, the fish.

18:10.296 --> 18:11.780
Behind the sofa?

18:13.022 --> 18:15.059
Well, Willis said
they were kinda shy.

18:18.373 --> 18:20.168
I don't see
any aquarium.

18:20.306 --> 18:21.997
Good. I guess
I don't have to
feed no fish then.

18:23.516 --> 18:24.689
But you said
they'd die.

18:24.827 --> 18:26.622
It don't bother me none.
I hate fish anyway.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.037
Come on.

18:29.729 --> 18:31.040
Where are they?

18:31.179 --> 18:33.146
I know where
they ain't.

18:33.284 --> 18:36.149
Maybe George finally
got Louise to go upstairs.

18:36.287 --> 18:38.289
But we came down
in the elevator.
We would have seen them.

18:38.427 --> 18:39.877
Not if they took
the stairs.

18:40.015 --> 18:42.293
Oh. That means
they're probably
up there looking for us.

18:42.431 --> 18:44.675
She's right!
Come on, everybody.
Let's go.

18:45.986 --> 18:47.747
Florence,
you take the cake.

18:47.885 --> 18:49.852
Yeah, I do.
Don't I?

18:55.030 --> 18:56.549
Look! The elevator's
coming down.

18:56.687 --> 18:57.619
It must be them.

18:57.757 --> 18:59.138
Let's surprise them
when they get off.

18:59.276 --> 19:00.277
Okay.

19:00.415 --> 19:01.761
TOM: Everybody get ready.
All right.

19:02.727 --> 19:04.177
ALL: Surprise!

19:16.189 --> 19:18.122
What in the hell
do you think
you're doing?

19:18.260 --> 19:19.503
Terribly sorry.

19:19.641 --> 19:21.470
I thought I was taking
Mr. And Mrs.
Jefferson's picture.

19:21.608 --> 19:24.232
Oh, yeah? Well, you
can't fool me, buster.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.407
You tell my wife,
"Better luck next time!"

19:30.583 --> 19:32.171
I say!

19:34.794 --> 19:37.900
I'd have given him
a print if he'd
asked for it.

19:38.038 --> 19:39.316
Wasn't that
congressman...

19:39.454 --> 19:42.491
Yes. And I'll never
vote for him again.

19:42.629 --> 19:44.976
Oh, your poor camera,
Mr. Bentley.

19:45.114 --> 19:46.426
Is it
gonna work?

19:46.564 --> 19:48.601
BENTLEY: It's all right.

19:48.739 --> 19:50.775
Florence,
what's going on?

19:50.913 --> 19:53.192
Oh, we just waiting
for you and Mr. Jefferson.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.159
Mrs. Jefferson!

19:55.297 --> 19:57.368
Hey, you guys!
It's Mrs. Jefferson!

19:58.127 --> 19:59.715
Louise, where
did you come from?

20:00.613 --> 20:01.545
We just came down
the steps.

20:01.683 --> 20:02.649
Where y'all been?

20:02.787 --> 20:04.237
We thought
you were down here.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.860
Uh, George,
what is this?

20:06.998 --> 20:09.380
It's supposed to be
a surprise birthday
party for you.

20:09.518 --> 20:10.726
One, two, three,

20:10.864 --> 20:12.625
ALL: Surprise!

20:14.834 --> 20:17.768
Oh, but my birthday
isn't until Tuesday.

20:17.906 --> 20:19.701
That's part of
the surprise.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.083
Oh, this is
fantastic.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.190
I had no idea!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.675
You almost spoiled
the whole thing

20:28.813 --> 20:31.333
when you came home early
from the doctor
this morning.

20:31.471 --> 20:34.302
You mean,
you weren't holding
a tenants' meeting?

20:34.440 --> 20:36.407
No! We were just
getting ready for tonight.

20:36.545 --> 20:39.099
And now,
it's presents time!

20:51.664 --> 20:53.182
ALL: Happy birthday!

20:53.321 --> 20:55.564
Many happy returns,
Louise!

20:55.702 --> 20:57.048
Oh, Louise,
you're wonderful!

20:57.186 --> 20:58.533
Happy birthday
next Tuesday, Weez.

20:58.671 --> 20:59.982
Oh!

21:00.120 --> 21:02.019
Thank you,
all of you.

21:02.675 --> 21:04.849
This is wonderful.

21:04.987 --> 21:06.989
Oh, what's
the matter, girl?

21:07.127 --> 21:09.854
Everybody is
giving me things.

21:09.992 --> 21:13.064
On my birthday,
I only complain
when they don't.

21:16.102 --> 21:18.691
I'm always taking,
taking.

21:18.829 --> 21:20.796
Never giving.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.626
Well, you can
give me some help
in the kitchen.

21:23.868 --> 21:25.525
With the cleaning
and the cooking.

21:25.663 --> 21:27.320
Your cooking
needs some help.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.875
I don't see you
getting no skinnier.

21:32.221 --> 21:34.120
You don't see me getting
no fatter neither, do you?

21:34.914 --> 21:36.502
Only around the mouth.

21:41.127 --> 21:44.441
I'm not talking about
doing cleaning and cooking.

21:44.579 --> 21:46.926
I'm talking about doing
something with my life.

21:47.064 --> 21:48.824
Damn it, Weezy!

21:48.962 --> 21:50.447
Look, I've had it
with you moping around,
feeling sorry for yourself,

21:50.585 --> 21:52.069
just because you ain't
got nothing to do.

21:52.207 --> 21:54.140
Look, you got all the time
and money you need.

21:54.278 --> 21:55.728
If you can't find
something to do with it,

21:55.866 --> 21:58.109
you are
in big trouble.

21:58.247 --> 21:59.732
We ain't gonna let you
spoil this party

21:59.870 --> 22:01.320
that we worked
hard to plan.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.529
Now, I'm going
in the kitchen,
get some ice,

22:03.667 --> 22:04.840
and I'm gonna
come out here,

22:04.978 --> 22:05.910
and we're gonna have
a birthday party for you,

22:06.048 --> 22:07.360
whether you like it
or not!

22:11.640 --> 22:13.746
Boy, is he
short-tempered!

22:13.884 --> 22:15.541
And bull-headed.

22:15.989 --> 22:17.059
And right.

22:17.197 --> 22:18.302
Huh?

22:18.440 --> 22:20.684
There's nothing
stopping me but myself.

22:20.822 --> 22:22.720
I can do anything
I want to do.

22:22.858 --> 22:23.859
Right.

22:23.997 --> 22:25.378
Well, what do you
want to do?

22:26.068 --> 22:27.622
I wanna...

22:27.760 --> 22:29.348
I wanna...

22:30.556 --> 22:32.558
I don't know
what I wanna do.

22:33.421 --> 22:35.595
Hey. Hey, mom.

22:36.631 --> 22:38.080
Remember when
I was little?

22:38.218 --> 22:40.462
You used to ask me
what I wanted to be
when I grew up.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.534
Yeah. You wanted
to be a pirate.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.087
A pirate?

22:52.578 --> 22:53.613
And remember,
I used to

22:53.751 --> 22:55.339
always ask you what
you wanted to be.

22:55.477 --> 22:56.651
Yeah.

22:56.789 --> 22:58.169
And you said that
you always wanted...

22:58.307 --> 23:00.102
To be a nurse.

23:00.240 --> 23:01.966
Oh, do you still
wanna be one?

23:02.104 --> 23:03.830
Sure.
But I couldn't...

23:03.968 --> 23:05.591
Well, then,
be one.

23:06.177 --> 23:08.421
Oh, no.
Be serious.

23:08.559 --> 23:09.491
What am I
gonna do,

23:09.629 --> 23:11.010
walk into a hospital
and say,

23:11.148 --> 23:13.840
"Hi. I've come to be
a nurse"?

23:13.978 --> 23:16.325
Well, sure. They've got
a nursing program in school.

23:16.464 --> 23:18.466
It only takes two years
to become a registered nurse.

23:19.052 --> 23:20.640
Two years?

23:20.778 --> 23:22.262
Do you think
I could do it?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.748
You just said it yourself.
You can do
anything you want to.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.784
You're right!

23:26.922 --> 23:28.268
Okay, everybody...

23:28.407 --> 23:29.856
How about a toast
for the birthday girl?

23:29.994 --> 23:31.133
JENNY: Hey!

23:31.271 --> 23:34.240
You mean,
to nurse Jefferson.

23:34.378 --> 23:35.586
Say what?

23:35.724 --> 23:37.933
Oh, George.

23:38.071 --> 23:39.901
I'm gonna study
to become a nurse.

23:40.039 --> 23:41.178
Isn't that
great?

23:41.316 --> 23:42.766
Why? I ain't sick.

23:44.319 --> 23:47.011
I think it is
a sensational idea!

23:47.149 --> 23:48.944
No, it ain't.
But, George...

23:49.082 --> 23:50.325
Hey, wait a minute!

23:50.463 --> 23:53.535
She's right.
It is a sensational idea.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.055
You mean
you don't object?

23:56.193 --> 23:58.057
I'll be spending
a lot of time studying.

23:58.195 --> 24:00.231
Of course
I don't object, Weez.

24:00.369 --> 24:03.372
Oh, George,
you're so unselfish.

24:03.718 --> 24:05.098
I know.

24:05.547 --> 24:06.617
Look, Weez...

24:06.755 --> 24:08.170
When you start working
at that hospital,

24:08.308 --> 24:09.827
you can get me
all the contracts

24:09.965 --> 24:11.139
to clean
the nurses' uniforms...

24:11.277 --> 24:13.590
Oh, George.
...sheets, aprons,

24:13.728 --> 24:14.694
doctors' uniforms...

24:14.832 --> 24:16.040
Oh, George!

24:39.374 --> 24:43.171
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
