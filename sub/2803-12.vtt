WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.482
MORNING, PETER.

00:04.569 --> 00:07.181
I SEE YOUR QUEST FOR MANHATTAN'S
BEST BREW CONTINUES.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.312
ONE'S FOR YOU.

00:08.399 --> 00:09.966
OH.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.011
YANKEE TICKETS.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.186
VERSUS THE RED SOX.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.144
YEAH, I GOT THEM
FROM FRANKIE WHISPERS.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.406
I'M NOT GONNA USE THEM.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.017
THEY'RE BEHIND
HOME PLATE.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
OH?
I HEAR THAT'S GOOD.
UH-HUH.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.977
YOU BOUGHT COFFEE,
YANKEE TICKETS --

00:21.064 --> 00:22.848
THIS IS NOT
YOUR MOST SUBTLE CON.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.981
CON? PETER,
I AM HURT THAT YOU --

00:25.068 --> 00:27.375
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET BACK
ON MY GOOD SIDE.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.463
IS THAT A CRIME?

00:28.550 --> 00:30.421
NO.
BUT LET'S REVIEW WHAT IS.

00:30.508 --> 00:33.163
MOZZIE STEALS YOUR TREASURE,
AND DO YOU REPORT IT?

00:33.250 --> 00:34.773
NO.
YOU PLOT TO STEAL IT.

00:34.860 --> 00:35.861
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.254
OH, BUT WE DO.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.126
WE DISCOVERED
ADLER'S U-BOAT.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.692
AND WHILE YOU WERE
COMING IN HERE,

00:40.779 --> 00:42.129
LOOKING ME
RIGHT IN THE EYE,

00:42.216 --> 00:44.479
YOU WERE HIDING THE ART
UNDER MY NOSE.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.524
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST
OF IT.

00:46.611 --> 00:47.960
LOOK, PETER, I'M SORRY.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.571
OKAY?
YOU SHOULD BE.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.530
I'M SORRY ELIZABETH WAS PUT
IN DANGER BECAUSE OF ME.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.054
[ SIGHS ]

00:54.141 --> 00:56.099
HOW'S SHE DOING?

00:56.186 --> 00:57.448
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT HERE.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.537
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.538
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BACK
ON MY GOOD SIDE?

01:00.625 --> 01:02.366
YES.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.934
THEN I SUGGEST WE DIG INTO
THE MORTENSON REAL-ESTATE SCAM.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.327
YOU'RE RIGHT.
FOCUS ON WORK.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.981
FOCUS.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.378
DID HOGWARTS
BOOK A FIELD TRIP?

01:14.465 --> 01:15.684
LOOKS LIKE IT.
JONES, WHO'S THAT?

01:15.771 --> 01:17.729
OH, UH, EVAN LEARY.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.514
THE KID WAS SITTING IN THE LOBBY
SINCE 7:00.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.777
SAID HE WOULDN'T LEAVE UNTIL
HE SPOKE WITH A CASE AGENT.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.735
HE ASKED TO SEE
A CASE AGENT.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.215
UH-HUH.SOMEONE DID HIS HOMEWORK.

01:25.302 --> 01:28.000
10 POINTS FOR GRYFFINDOR.
COME ON.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.393
EVAN?

01:29.480 --> 01:32.004
HI. I'M SPECIAL AGENT
PETER BURKE.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.136
AGENT BURKE.
AND AGENT...?

01:33.223 --> 01:34.224
UH, NEAL...

01:34.311 --> 01:35.530
CAFFREY.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.184
I WORK HERE,
BUT I'M NOT AN AGENT.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.141
TOOK THE ROAD
LESS RECOMMENDED.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.229
NICE TIE.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.188
MANHATTAN PREP?
YEAH.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.277
HOW CAN WE HELP YOU,
EVAN?

01:43.364 --> 01:45.409
UM, COULD WE SIT?
I BROUGHT VISUAL AIDS.

01:45.496 --> 01:48.195
VISUAL AIDS.
SURE. LET'S GO TO MY OFFICE.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.677
I'VE BEEN GOING TO
MANHATTAN PREP SINCE 9th GRADE.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.375
MY FAMILY'S NOT RICH
LIKE MOST OF THE KIDS,

01:54.462 --> 01:55.463
SO I CAN'T AFFORD TUITION.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.204
AND I DISCOVERED LAST WEEK

01:57.291 --> 01:59.206
THAT MY FINANCIAL AID
IS BEING PULLED.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.294
EXCELLENT PRESENTATION.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.817
THANK YOU.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.689
IF YOU TURN TO SECTION 1,
YOU'LL SEE WHY I'M HERE.

02:04.776 --> 02:07.127
YOU THINK SOMEONE'S EMBEZZLING
SCHOLARSHIP MONEY

02:07.214 --> 02:08.519
FROM THE SCHOOL'S
ENDOWMENT.

02:08.606 --> 02:09.781
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.392
IT'S HIS THESIS
STATEMENT.
MM.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.611
LOOK, EVAN,

02:13.698 --> 02:16.223
LOSING YOUR SCHOLARSHIP
DOESN'T MEAN SOMEONE'S STEALING.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.007
SCHOOLS CUT FUNDING
ALL THE TIME.

02:18.094 --> 02:19.661
OF COURSE.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH,

02:19.748 --> 02:21.489
IT SHOWS THAT THE ENDOWMENTS
STAYED PRETTY EVEN

02:21.576 --> 02:23.055
WHILE THE FINANCIAL AID
HAS BEEN DROPPING

02:23.143 --> 02:24.274
OVER THE PAST
EIGHT YEARS.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.450
WHERE DID YOU
GET THESE NUMBERS?

02:26.537 --> 02:28.931
I WORK AT THE BURSAR'S OFFICE,
AND I DUG AROUND.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.281
LOOK,
THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ME.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.066
THIS IS ABOUT
A LOT OF KIDS.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.373
EVAN, ENDOWMENTS COVER
OPERATING COSTS, SALARIES.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.593
THESE NUMBERS AREN'T ENOUGH
TO PROVE EMBEZZLEMENT.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.247
YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO MY CONCLUSION YET.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.335
IT'S THE RED TAB.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.075
OH, YES.
I CAN SEE THE RED TAB.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.295
SAYS THE SCHOLARSHIPS
STARTED DISAPPEARING

02:45.382 --> 02:47.558
THE YEAR ANDY WOODS TOOK OVER
THE ENDOWMENT FUND.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.473
ANDY WOODS?

02:49.560 --> 02:53.564
YEAH. UM, HIS DAUGHTER
GOES TO MANHATTAN PREP.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.698
CHLOE.
SHE -- SHE'S...VERY NICE.

02:56.785 --> 03:00.745
BUT I THINK MR. WOODS
IS A BAD GUY.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.617
YOU GOT ONE
CONCLUSION RIGHT.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.749
ANDY WOODS --
AMERICAN FINANCIER

03:04.836 --> 03:08.188
WE'VE LONG SUSPECTED OF MANAGING
MONEY FOR THE JUAREZ CARTEL.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.973
THOSE ARE SOME BRUTAL GUYS
TO BE IN BUSINESS WITH.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.235
WOODS MAY HAVE
A CORNER OFFICE,

03:12.322 --> 03:13.497
BUT HIS METHODS ARE DEFINITELY
FROM THE STREET.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.587
D.E.A. BELIEVES
HE LAUNDERS THE CASH

03:16.674 --> 03:17.980
THROUGH INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.938
NOW, WE'VE NEVER HAD ENOUGH
TO GO AFTER HIM,

03:20.025 --> 03:22.506
BUT THIS MAY BE ENOUGH
TO GIVE US AN IN.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.594
NEAL?

03:23.681 --> 03:24.943
WE HAVE VISUAL AIDS.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.728
NOW,
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE,

03:26.815 --> 03:27.859
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO SHARE

03:27.946 --> 03:29.470
UNTIL WESLEY GETS BACK
WITH MORE COPIES.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.689
TABS -- NICE.COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

03:31.776 --> 03:34.039
WOODS LOST A LANDMARK DIVORCE
SETTLEMENT TO MRS. WOODS

03:34.126 --> 03:36.085
AFTER SHE FOUND OUT
HE HAD A MISTRESS,

03:36.172 --> 03:38.522
BUT HE MADE SURE TO RETAIN
CUSTODY OF THEIR DAUGHTER.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.307
CHLOE -- 17.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
WHEN SHE STARTED
AT MANHATTAN PREP,

03:42.439 --> 03:44.528
WOODS WAS ELECTED
TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

03:44.615 --> 03:47.096
AND PUT IN CHARGE
OF THE ENDOWMENT FUND.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.271
YOU THINK HE'S TREATING
THE ENDOWMENT

03:48.358 --> 03:49.185
LIKE HIS OWN PIGGY BANK.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.708
EXACTLY.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.884
I'LL APPROACH THE SCHOOL
AS A WEALTHY PARENT

03:52.971 --> 03:53.929
WITH A TEENAGE SON.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.017
I'LL NEED AN ALIAS.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.584
Neal:
ALISTAIR STONE --

03:56.671 --> 03:59.369
A WEALTHY HONG KONG BANKER
RELOCATING TO NEW YORK

03:59.456 --> 04:01.893
LOOKING FOR A SCHOOL
FOR YOUR SON, ALISTAIR JR.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.765
YOU LIKE CATAMARANS
AND COGNAC.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.810
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
AN ALIAS SAVANT.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.422
I DO LIKE CATAMARANS,

04:08.509 --> 04:10.424
BUT LET'S GO WITH PETER
INSTEAD OF ALISTAIR.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.947
LINDA'S GONNA BE UPSET.

04:12.034 --> 04:13.296
LINDA?
YOUR WIFE.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.298
SHE AFFECTIONATELY
CALLS YOU "ALI."

04:15.385 --> 04:17.387
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.
I'LL SCHEDULE A MEETING.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.346
LET ME.
I'LL BE YOUR AMANUENSIS.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.435
FOLLOW YOU AROUND,
WRITE THINGS DOWN,

04:21.522 --> 04:23.263
MAKE YOU LOOK POWERFUL.MY MENU WHAT?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.352
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY
"ASSISTANT"?

04:25.439 --> 04:26.570
NOT AT MANHATTAN PREP.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.745
OH.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.882
I MIGHT HAVE GRADUATED IF I HAD
GONE SOMEWHERE LIKE THIS.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.579
I'M SURPRISED
YOU LIKE IT HERE.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.320
EVEN THE KINDERGARTNERS
WEAR TIES.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.540
YOU KNOW,IF MY
SENTENCE GETS COMMUTED,

04:39.627 --> 04:40.671
I'D CONSIDER GOING BACK
TO SCHOOL.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.412
MM.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.806
MAYBE GET A MASTER'S,
STUDY ABROAD, PUBLISH.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.461
DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF
THERE, HEMINGWAY.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.115
I HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I'M GONNA
CLOSE THE KELLER CASE.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.378
I TOLD YOU --

04:51.465 --> 04:52.683
FOCUS ON WORK.

04:52.770 --> 04:53.771
WORDS TO LIVE BY.

04:56.687 --> 04:58.863
MY SCHOOL NEVER HAD
A FALCONRY CLUB.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.823
GUESS PETER JR. WILL BE
THE FALCONER IN THE FAMILY.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.303
WHERE ARE YOU STAYING WHILE
YOU'RE IN TOWN, MR. STONE?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.478
THE COMPANY PUTS ME UP
AT THE FOUR SEASONS.

05:04.565 --> 05:05.870

05:05.957 --> 05:07.219
LINDA LOVES THE SPA.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309

MAKE IT THIS TRIP.

05:14.139 --> 05:15.619
ALL RIGHT, WAIT HERE.

WHILE I MEET WITH WOODS.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.433
I MIGHT GET EXPELLED.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
WELL, THAT'S NO GOOD.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.046
ME AND THIS OTHER KID --

05:51.133 --> 05:53.178
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.180
MAKE EYE CONTACT.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.181
IF THEY NOD, YOU NOD.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.487
DO WHAT THEY DO.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.967
IT MAKES THEM THINK
YOU'RE LISTENING.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.447
THEN YOU LOOK THEM
IN THE EYE

06:00.534 --> 06:01.796
AND TELL THEM
YOU'RE SORRY.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.188
DON'T LOOK DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

06:03.275 --> 06:04.625

YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.165
AT LEAST YOU WORE A JACKET.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.514
I THINK YOU GOT ME
MIXED UP --

06:24.601 --> 06:26.429
IF I HAD A SONG
FOR EVERY SUBSTITUTE

06:26.516 --> 06:28.170
I HAD TO TRACK DOWN

BELL'S ABOUT TO RING,
MR. COOPER. YOU'LL BE LATE.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.837
WHAT KIND OF AN EXAMPLE
WOULD THAT SET?

06:42.924 --> 06:46.014
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MAKE
TEENAGERS CARE ABOUT READING.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.799
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO FOCUS ON THE WORK.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.018
SO, WHERE'S MY CLASS?

06:51.106 --> 06:52.542

WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY --

07:48.511 --> 07:50.600
SO DID I.
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

07:50.687 --> 07:54.082
NO. BUT, UH, NOTHING'S BETTER
THAN A SCHOOL WITH CONNECTIONS.

A HANDFUL, TOO, HUH?

08:07.530 --> 08:10.141
HE'S VERY INTELLIGENT
BUT IMPULSIVE.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.970
