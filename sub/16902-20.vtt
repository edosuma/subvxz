WEBVTT

00:04.557 --> 00:06.891
- How late is Tracy now?
- 2 1/2 hours.

00:06.958 --> 00:08.424
[buzzes]
this is outrageous.

00:08.493 --> 00:10.660
Especially after I was told
I can't leave during the day

00:10.727 --> 00:13.994
For my ridiculous anger
management stupid piece of crap!

00:14.061 --> 00:15.361
How did this happen?

00:15.430 --> 00:17.229
I had Grizz call him
at 8:00 this morning

00:17.298 --> 00:18.898
And pretend it was 11:00.

00:18.965 --> 00:20.532
I printed up that fake
rehearsal schedule for him,

00:20.599 --> 00:22.733
Saying we were starting
at 9:00 instead of noon.

00:22.799 --> 00:23.899
Oh, and I set all his
watches and clocks

00:23.967 --> 00:25.601
To say P.M.
When it's really A.M.

00:25.668 --> 00:27.403
Oh, boy.
We may have overdone it.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.403
What the hell time
is it?

00:29.471 --> 00:31.571
Hey, you're here!
Let's rehearse!

00:31.639 --> 00:34.442
No! I took my son to his
cello recital this morning

00:34.509 --> 00:36.844
At what turned out to be
midnight yesterday!

00:36.912 --> 00:39.177
White oppressors,
answer my question.

00:39.245 --> 00:40.744
<b>What time is it, really?</b>

00:40.813 --> 00:43.114
- 2:45 P.M.
- You're a bunch of racists.

00:43.183 --> 00:45.082
What? How did we jump
to that already?

00:45.151 --> 00:47.750
You treat me like a child!
No--worse than that!

00:47.819 --> 00:50.553
You treat me like one of those
little pageant girls

00:50.621 --> 00:52.554
With the clip-on teeth.

00:52.622 --> 00:55.423
No, no, Oprah says that you
teach people how to treat you,

00:55.492 --> 00:56.624
And this is what
you've taught us,

00:56.693 --> 00:57.892
Because you're always late

00:57.959 --> 00:59.728
And you take no responsibility
for your actions.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.028
Irregardless!

01:01.097 --> 01:02.629
You know what?
Race card.

01:02.697 --> 01:05.431
No, don't accept it!

01:06.766 --> 01:09.033
Hey, Jack,
just a heads-up.

01:09.099 --> 01:10.801
Tracy knows what time it is.

01:10.868 --> 01:12.568
- Damn it.
- Sir.

01:12.636 --> 01:14.203
Your mother would like to have
breakfast with you

01:14.272 --> 01:15.737
At the hotel tomorrow,

01:15.805 --> 01:17.705
And she had me make dinner
reservations for tonight.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.441
And by night,
I mean 4:30 this afternoon.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.842
Colleen's in town?

01:21.910 --> 01:24.211
If you need a break,
I'd be happy to take her out.

01:24.279 --> 01:26.679
There's a restaurant hostess
in midtown I'd like to see cry.

01:26.746 --> 01:29.113
Thank you, but I need to be
the attentive son this visit.

01:29.181 --> 01:31.582
This Thursday marks
an anniversary for my mother,

01:31.650 --> 01:33.249
An unpleasant one.

01:33.317 --> 01:35.284
35 years ago, my father,
Jimmy Donaghy,

01:35.351 --> 01:37.018
Went out for a pack
of cigarettes,

01:37.086 --> 01:38.853
Came back, smoked one,

01:38.921 --> 01:40.353
Told my mother
he was leaving forever,

01:40.423 --> 01:41.756
And walked out the door.

01:41.824 --> 01:44.558
Oh, boy, that must be hard...
For both of you.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.225
He treated her like dirt
all those years,

01:46.293 --> 01:48.526
Coming and going,
taking up with other women,

01:48.594 --> 01:50.595
Including more than one
Unitarian!

01:50.662 --> 01:51.894
Every time he came back,

01:51.962 --> 01:53.698
I promised myself
I would tell him off.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.232
I had my speech all planned.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.133
But I always chickened out.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.601
It's the biggest regret
of my life, Lemon...

01:59.669 --> 02:01.603
And I once made love
to Kathy Hilton.

02:01.671 --> 02:04.206
Do you...Want a hug?

02:04.273 --> 02:05.906
What is this,
the Italian parliament?

02:05.973 --> 02:07.440
No, thank you, Lemon.

02:07.508 --> 02:10.243
Well, you're a good son.
I know she's not easy.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.144
Sir, your mother had me
move her from the plaza

02:12.211 --> 02:13.944
To the Carlyle.

02:14.014 --> 02:15.814
Evidently, the concierge
at the plaza

02:15.881 --> 02:20.017
"has a beard," and she'd
rather not get raped.

02:23.088 --> 02:24.588
Please,
tell me we've started.

02:24.655 --> 02:26.756
Yes, actually, we're on
our second run-through.

02:26.824 --> 02:28.492
What is this?
[buzz]

02:28.559 --> 02:29.793
Tracy hasn't come back yet,

02:29.860 --> 02:31.662
But he did sent a gibbon
to rehearse in his place.

02:31.729 --> 02:35.031
[laughs]
he's pretty good.

02:35.098 --> 02:36.331
Hey.

02:36.399 --> 02:38.200
Did you guys know about this?

02:38.267 --> 02:41.102
Tracy has asked us
to read this prepared statement.

02:41.171 --> 02:43.941
- "Dear racist Liz Lemon..."
- oh!

02:44.007 --> 02:45.874
"this is how you treat me,

02:45.942 --> 02:47.510
"like a white-whiskered gibbon

02:47.577 --> 02:49.746
"put on this earth
to do nothing

02:49.813 --> 02:51.915
"but dance around
for your amusement

02:51.982 --> 02:54.684
And reduce the insect
population of Malaysia."

02:54.752 --> 02:55.918
Okay, I don't know

02:55.986 --> 02:58.353
Which of these five
cell numbers he answers,

02:58.421 --> 03:00.589
But you get
Tracy down here right now.

03:00.657 --> 03:02.825
Why? The gibbon is on time,
he knows his blocking,

03:02.892 --> 03:05.327
And he doesn't try
to bite the dancers!

03:08.198 --> 03:10.332
I think
I've proven my point.

03:12.969 --> 03:14.102
Oh, my god!

03:14.171 --> 03:15.738
Like we really
have time for you

03:15.803 --> 03:17.205
To walk down the stairs
that slowly!

03:17.272 --> 03:18.773
Time jump!

03:18.842 --> 03:21.275
Tracy, it costs the show
a lot of money

03:21.343 --> 03:23.579
When you pull
these shenanigans.

03:23.646 --> 03:26.982
Don't patronize me with your
Celtic slang, Liz Lemon.

03:27.051 --> 03:28.617
We have
a black president now.

03:28.684 --> 03:30.951
What do you care?
You voted for Nader!

03:31.019 --> 03:32.487
This is post-racial America,

03:32.554 --> 03:35.257
And I demand to be treated
like everyone else.

03:35.324 --> 03:36.291
You wanna be treated
like everybody else?

03:36.358 --> 03:37.725
Fantastic.

03:37.793 --> 03:40.661
Then tomorrow, I'm sending
a regular town car for you

03:40.730 --> 03:42.529
Instead of one of those
duck tour boats.

03:42.596 --> 03:44.063
Fine.

03:44.131 --> 03:45.931
And you're no longer allowed
to point at women

03:46.000 --> 03:48.167
In the cafeteria and yell,
"I wanna get that pregnant!"

03:48.234 --> 03:50.537
Fine, I'll bring
my lunch from home.

03:50.603 --> 03:53.807
And be here tomorrow at
10:00 A.M. And know your lines.

03:53.874 --> 03:56.376
[commotion, murmuring]

03:56.444 --> 03:58.379
You don't think
I could do that?

03:58.446 --> 04:01.415
We'll find out tomorrow
at 10:00 A.M.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.482
Fine, but I'll have
the last laugh.

04:03.551 --> 04:04.984
Ha ha ha ha ha!

04:05.051 --> 04:07.119
Ah ha ha ha ha!

04:07.186 --> 04:12.624
[overlapping laughter]

04:12.693 --> 04:14.760
Hoo hah hah hah hah!

04:14.830 --> 04:16.863
Ah ha ha ha ha!

04:16.928 --> 04:19.831

04:42.745 --> 04:44.813
Beth, that was
a big mistake you made.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.182
Grizz, it was a year ago.
You're engaged now.

04:47.249 --> 04:48.652
Just drop it, okay--

04:48.718 --> 04:50.052
Oh, hey, Dotcom.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.520
Yelling at Tracy
in front of everybody

04:51.587 --> 04:53.188
Was a bad move, Liz.

04:53.256 --> 04:55.656
Yeah, well, it's not my job
to protect his feelings.

04:55.724 --> 04:56.891
I told you
she would turn cold.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.226
She's an ice queen.

04:58.294 --> 05:00.196
- Grizz.
- I'm just sayin'.

05:00.263 --> 05:03.166
You humiliate Tracy
in front of everybody like that,

05:03.234 --> 05:06.168
You give him two choices--
one, he won't show up tomorrow,

05:06.236 --> 05:08.237
And you'll look like a fool
in front of your crew.

05:08.305 --> 05:11.540
Or two, he will show up--

05:11.608 --> 05:13.542
and he'll find an even
worse way to act out.

05:13.609 --> 05:16.211
Exactly.

05:19.816 --> 05:21.416
Jack!

05:21.485 --> 05:23.018
What are you doing here?

05:23.087 --> 05:24.253
I'm here to pick you up
for dinner.

05:24.321 --> 05:25.387
No dinner.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.156
We're having breakfast
in the morning.

05:27.224 --> 05:28.392
I told your girl.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.260
My assistant
is named Jonathan.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.329
Yes, I know.
I met him.

05:32.396 --> 05:34.597
And he also said we had a
reservation for dinner tonight.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.132
Well, Jack, there's been
a misunderstanding.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.234
I have a previous engagement
with a friend.

05:38.303 --> 05:40.804
Colleen, can I borrow
one of your ties?

05:40.871 --> 05:41.971
Oh, brother.

05:42.038 --> 05:44.173
Paul, this is Jack, my son.

05:44.241 --> 05:46.543
Jack, this is Paul Brett.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.743
Mother, I didn't realize

05:47.811 --> 05:48.877
You were bringing
a companion along.

05:48.945 --> 05:51.880
Companion? Ha!
How fancy.

05:51.948 --> 05:53.482
Paul lives in Florida.

05:53.549 --> 05:56.251
He paints landscapes
and he makes his own soda.

05:56.318 --> 05:58.353
Jack, why don't you
join us for dinner?

05:58.422 --> 06:00.422
Great!
I'll call the restaurant.

06:00.489 --> 06:04.325
See if they can seat
a third wheel.

06:04.393 --> 06:06.427
Ah. Another day done.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.063
Now let's get outta here

06:08.131 --> 06:12.635
Before we realize
we've forgotten about something.

06:17.974 --> 06:21.609
I feel like
we're half-assing this.

06:21.678 --> 06:22.878
Oh, I didn't know
anyone was here.

06:22.946 --> 06:24.748
That wasn't me
screaming in the bathroom.

06:24.815 --> 06:26.249
What are you doing with him?

06:26.317 --> 06:28.251
Oh, Mr. Jordan says
he doesn't need it anymore.

06:28.319 --> 06:29.819
So you're just
letting him go?

06:29.888 --> 06:31.423
Well, don't worry.

06:31.488 --> 06:33.023
Once it tries to mate
with a child,

06:33.090 --> 06:35.058
I'm sure animal control
will just shoot it.

06:35.126 --> 06:37.594
No! He's not an animal.
Look at him!

06:37.664 --> 06:38.762
He's a little person!

06:38.830 --> 06:40.597
[giggling]

06:40.666 --> 06:42.466
Oh, he loves me!

06:42.535 --> 06:44.901
Somebody loves me.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.105
I'm gonna name him
little Jenna

06:47.172 --> 06:50.675
And let him live
in my dressing room.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.116
Lemon, Colleen brought
her boyfriend.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.484
His name is Paul.

07:00.551 --> 07:02.485
- What? Really?
- I don't like this guy.

07:02.554 --> 07:03.687
I don't trust him.

07:03.755 --> 07:05.555
I mean, he's four years
younger than my mother.

07:05.624 --> 07:07.090
He wears a pinkie ring.

07:07.159 --> 07:09.694
When the waiter brought over
the food, he said, "abbondanza."

07:09.761 --> 07:11.496
Okay, Jack, I know
this is a stressful time

07:11.563 --> 07:13.264
For you and your mother--

07:13.331 --> 07:14.865
You're right--I don't like
the timing of this at all.

07:14.932 --> 07:16.567
Colleen is very
vulnerable right now,

07:16.635 --> 07:18.103
And scam artists
can smell that sort of thing.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.638
Have you ever
been to Florida?

07:19.706 --> 07:21.206
It's basically
a criminal population.

07:21.273 --> 07:22.473
It's America's Australia.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.508
Come on,
maybe he just likes her.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.645
You know, some men
like older women.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.479
Let's...Not make this
about you, okay?

07:29.547 --> 07:32.618
I've gotta call
my private investigator.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.187
Liz, they want you
onstage for rehearsal.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.122
- Tracy's here already?
- I guess so.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.390
You know, this food area

07:38.458 --> 07:39.558
Is always the first place
I go to look for you--

07:39.626 --> 07:42.595
Thank you, Cerie.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.232
Tracy, you're here already.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.135
Professional
is my middle name.

07:50.202 --> 07:53.871
No need.
I've got it memorized.

07:55.506 --> 07:57.476
I'm going to do
a Valentino cross,

07:57.543 --> 07:59.711
Camera right,
then dump the laugh.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.714
So stay on your fours,
guys!

08:01.782 --> 08:04.485
One, two, three,
jump and pose!

08:04.551 --> 08:07.220
3:15.
Time for union break.

08:07.288 --> 08:10.123
[applause]

08:10.191 --> 08:13.426
Thank you, Tracy!
That is so great for morale.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.094
Listen, about yesterday--

08:15.162 --> 08:16.762
No. Do not apologize.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.197
In fact...
Everyone gather around.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.833
Actor announcement.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.201
I want to publicly thank you,
Liz Lemon,

08:22.268 --> 08:25.505
For you have shown me
that in today's world

08:25.572 --> 08:28.807
Everyone should be treated
exactly the same.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.544
No one should get
preferential treatment.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.679
I agree.
Exactly.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.947
Not black comedy superstars.
Not Hispanics.

08:37.017 --> 08:40.317
Not Indians.
Not whatever this guy is.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.186
And not women, Liz Lemon.

08:42.254 --> 08:44.388
I'm right there
with you, Tracy.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.458
Good. I feel parched
from being so professional.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.327
Could I trouble you
for some water?

08:49.395 --> 08:52.395
Yeah, of course.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.735
Brian, would you
help me out with this?

08:58.803 --> 09:00.537
No! No!

09:00.606 --> 09:02.838
- Equality.
- What?

09:02.906 --> 09:05.474
Everyone should be treated
the same, right, Liz Lemon?

09:05.543 --> 09:07.709
You should change it.

09:07.776 --> 09:11.548
Yeah, okay.
I know how to do this.

09:21.826 --> 09:24.095
No one help her!

09:32.671 --> 09:34.404
I got it.
That's good.

09:34.472 --> 09:37.474
Just gotta get my hammies
in the handles so I--

09:40.947 --> 09:43.414
Hold on.

09:43.481 --> 09:45.650
Oof!

09:51.791 --> 09:54.827
[panting]

10:00.533 --> 10:02.702
All right!

10:02.770 --> 10:05.371
Let's...Take it
from the top.

10:12.848 --> 10:14.981
[clicking]

10:17.120 --> 10:18.985
Hello, Len.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.489
Oh. Thanks for meeting me
here, Mr. Donaghy.

10:21.556 --> 10:24.723
You, uh...Staking out
a cheating husband?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.226
No. I'm taking
a photography class.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.396
Look at the way the sunlight
hits that cobweb.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.596
[clicking]

10:30.664 --> 10:33.066
So, uh, what have you
got for me?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.633
Well, I looked into
this Paul Brett guy,

10:34.701 --> 10:36.068
And I gotta tell you,

10:36.138 --> 10:38.403
This is the weirdest case
I've ever worked.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.107
I knew it.
What is he, a check forger?

10:40.174 --> 10:42.508
Real estate swindler?
Bird owner?

10:42.577 --> 10:44.043
- No, he's clean.
- What?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.578
I've never seen
anything like it.

10:45.647 --> 10:47.447
Everyone's
got something to hide.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.416
For instance, I'm wearing
a child's Halloween costume

10:49.483 --> 10:50.650
Under this.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.519
But this guy--
no priors, no debts.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.822
He's been married to his wife
Louise for 35 years.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.757
- He's married?
- Yeah.

10:57.826 --> 10:59.859
I wish I had more
to give you.

10:59.928 --> 11:01.962
But this Paul Brett guy,
he's, uh...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.697
He's like a boy scout.

11:03.765 --> 11:05.699
I'm sorry, Mr. Donaghy.

11:11.741 --> 11:14.844
Miss Maroney, I have
the ukulele you asked for.

11:14.911 --> 11:16.145
Oh, it's not for me.

11:16.213 --> 11:19.147
Someone's in a little
mariachi band today.

11:19.215 --> 11:20.850
Ma'am, this is a wild animal.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.452
You can't treat it
like a person.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.719
No, he's happy.

11:23.786 --> 11:25.520
His costume
is hiding his erection.

11:25.587 --> 11:27.288
Well, as a child,
I had a prize pig

11:27.356 --> 11:29.058
That I thought
was my best friend.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.027
But then one day,
I picked up one of her piglets.

11:32.094 --> 11:34.162
She went crazy!

11:34.230 --> 11:36.031
She bit off my nut sack

11:36.099 --> 11:39.001
That I kept tied around
my belt to feed squirrels.

11:39.068 --> 11:42.136
Please be careful,
Miss Maroney.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.042
Tracy did that thing
with the water on purpose.

11:48.110 --> 11:49.978
Grizz and Dotcom warned me
he would act out.

11:50.046 --> 11:52.480
Look, if Tracy's revenge plan

11:52.550 --> 11:54.416
Involves him
being good at his job,

11:54.484 --> 11:57.386
You might have
to just take it.

11:59.989 --> 12:01.456
Hello, Liz Lemon.

12:01.524 --> 12:03.059
I was just
telling these fellas

12:03.126 --> 12:05.460
About how you don't wanna be
treated any differently

12:05.528 --> 12:07.595
Because you're a woman.

12:07.662 --> 12:09.198
Well, thank you.
Of course I don't.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.232
Really. You don't want us
to hold back anymore.

12:11.300 --> 12:13.800
I'm sorry--were you guys
holding back something?

12:13.869 --> 12:15.535
Our farts,
to start with.

12:15.603 --> 12:18.573
Also, we didn't invite you
to Lutz's fake bachelor party.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.041
Lutz's what?

12:20.109 --> 12:21.476
I realize I'm never
getting married

12:21.544 --> 12:22.710
Because of my gland thing...

12:22.779 --> 12:23.878
But I wanna have
a bachelor party.

12:23.945 --> 12:26.580
Well, you should have
invited me.

12:26.649 --> 12:28.816
It's not fair...
That you didn't.

12:28.884 --> 12:30.718
We're goin'
to a strip club.

12:30.784 --> 12:34.288
I'm glad that we're having
this conversation,

12:34.355 --> 12:36.423
Because we live in a world

12:36.492 --> 12:38.191
Where a lot of
the old divisions

12:38.260 --> 12:40.127
Are starting to disappear.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.596
And I hope to have
a daughter someday,

12:42.663 --> 12:44.865
And I want her to--

12:44.932 --> 12:46.499
Aghh. Oh, god,
what is that smell?

12:46.568 --> 12:48.634
Oh, dear lord, frank!

12:48.703 --> 12:51.439
It's like orange-flavored egg!
It's in my mouth!

12:51.505 --> 12:53.308
Good. We're learning.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.942
This next one's me.

12:55.010 --> 13:03.249
Ohh!

12:58.730 --> 12:58.830
{ Advertisement }

13:05.119 --> 13:07.385
Hey, Jack,
do you treat me any differently

13:07.454 --> 13:08.755
Because I'm a woman?

13:08.823 --> 13:11.758
Well, I pay you
a little less, yes.

13:11.826 --> 13:12.992
No, I mean day-to-day.

13:13.061 --> 13:14.829
- Do you coddle me?
- In some ways.

13:14.896 --> 13:16.764
With a man,
I can be more direct,

13:16.831 --> 13:19.699
But with you, uh,
I have to have a conversation,

13:19.767 --> 13:21.367
Talk things through more.

13:21.435 --> 13:23.035
Gimme an example.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.539
Well, uh...
Right now comes to mind.

13:26.608 --> 13:28.840
Are we through listening
and sharing,

13:28.909 --> 13:32.243
Because I have something
I want you to look at.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.746
It's a marriage certificate.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.712
It's Paul's
marriage certificate.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.181
My mother's boyfriend.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.150
- He's married.
- What?

13:39.218 --> 13:42.221
I knew I was right.
That guy is shady!

13:42.288 --> 13:43.556
Oh, my god.
Have you told Colleen?

13:43.622 --> 13:44.722
No Colleen.

13:44.789 --> 13:46.290
I have an opportunity here,
Lemon,

13:46.358 --> 13:49.760
A chance to go back
to the past to put things right

13:49.828 --> 13:50.895
That once went wrong.

13:50.962 --> 13:52.930
<b>That's the quantum leap
intro.</b>

13:52.997 --> 13:54.231
Be that as it may,

13:54.298 --> 13:56.935
I'm finally going
to stand up for Colleen.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.971
The small part of her
that is still human deserves it.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.739
I'll see Paul,

14:01.807 --> 14:04.176
And I'll give him the speech
I wrote for Jimmy Donaghy.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.778
- Paul's not your dad, Jack.
- But Paul's here.

14:06.845 --> 14:09.247
And he's taking advantage
of my mother.

14:09.314 --> 14:11.615
Now, what I originally
wrote for my father

14:11.682 --> 14:12.815
May be dated.

14:12.883 --> 14:15.585
Who would be our current
Nikita Khrushchev?

14:15.653 --> 14:16.855
Mm...Simon Cowell?

14:16.921 --> 14:17.987
[gasps]

14:18.056 --> 14:19.789
Now you're standing
on the very spot

14:19.857 --> 14:22.692
Where Gracie Allen
took Jack Paar's virginity.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.826
I thought I heard a tour.

14:23.895 --> 14:25.628
Boy, people
are not gonna believe

14:25.696 --> 14:27.130
<i>That you saw this.</i>

14:27.197 --> 14:29.433
- So take a lot of pictures.
- Miss Maroney.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.536
No good will come of this.
This is unnatural.

14:32.603 --> 14:36.038
It is unnatural...For
a grandmother to look this good!

14:36.106 --> 14:37.974
Little Jenna
had a baby last night.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.841
Crowd: Ooh!

14:39.909 --> 14:41.243
Thank you.

14:47.049 --> 14:49.485
Good job
with the water, Liz.

14:49.552 --> 14:51.887
Ow, frank!
What the hell?

14:51.954 --> 14:53.688
What? I'm trying
to treat you like one of us.

14:53.756 --> 14:55.893
Hello, Elizabeth.

14:55.958 --> 14:58.895
Tracy, shouldn't you be
working down on stage?

14:58.961 --> 15:02.165
I'm done with my work.
I was very professional.

15:02.231 --> 15:03.697
Hmm. That must have been
hard for you.

15:03.764 --> 15:05.266
It was.

15:05.335 --> 15:08.468
All right, Tracy's here.
Let's do this bachelor party.

15:08.536 --> 15:10.837
- Yeah!
- You coming, Liz Lemon?

15:10.905 --> 15:12.305
Because a dude boss
would be a jerk

15:12.373 --> 15:14.641
If he didn't come
to Lutz's bachelor party.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.877
Also a dude boss
would pay for it.

15:17.944 --> 15:23.381
Yeah, I'm coming.
Of course I'm coming.

15:23.449 --> 15:26.084
- But you're not.
- Twist!

15:26.152 --> 15:27.752
You have to stay here.

15:27.821 --> 15:30.255
I haven't gotten your notes
on the rewrite,

15:30.323 --> 15:32.758
And your input
is invaluable to the process...

15:32.826 --> 15:35.528
Since we're all equal now.

15:35.596 --> 15:39.832
Let's go see some naked
daughters and moms!

15:39.900 --> 15:41.501
- All right!
- Whoo hoo!

15:41.568 --> 15:44.070
[indistinct cheering]

15:49.075 --> 15:50.442
Oh. Hello, Jack.

15:50.511 --> 15:52.612
I'm sorry.
Your mom's out shopping.

15:52.679 --> 15:53.813
I know.

15:53.881 --> 15:55.348
My credit card company
called to confirm

15:55.415 --> 15:58.618
<b>My purchase of a book entitled
intercourse after hip surgery.</b>

15:58.686 --> 16:03.358
Well...Why don't you
come on in?

16:03.425 --> 16:06.061
I'm just watching
the hotel channel.

16:06.129 --> 16:08.099
You can check out
on the TV.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.035
I bet you can,
you son of a bitch.

16:10.101 --> 16:11.536
I beg your pardon?

16:11.603 --> 16:14.104
I am tired of watching you
treat my mother like this.

16:14.172 --> 16:16.939
I am not afraid of you.
You're just a big bully.

16:17.006 --> 16:19.142
Like Simon Cowell.
That's right.

16:19.209 --> 16:20.944
I just called you
a communist.

16:21.011 --> 16:22.946
I want you out
of our lives forever,

16:23.014 --> 16:25.115
[door opens]
and I want you to know

16:25.182 --> 16:26.316
That I am never
going to be

16:26.385 --> 16:28.318
Anything like you
when I grow up.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.955
What in god's name
is going on here?

16:31.022 --> 16:34.728
Paul is leaving, mother.
And I think you should know why.

16:34.794 --> 16:35.994
He's married.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.963
Oh, my--

16:38.031 --> 16:39.467
I know that!

16:39.533 --> 16:41.233
[sighs] Paul...

16:41.301 --> 16:42.935
Find something to do
in the bathroom.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.105
I have to talk to my son.

16:45.173 --> 16:48.040
Okay.

16:48.109 --> 16:49.275
Shoot.

16:49.343 --> 16:50.943
You knew?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.945
It's Florida, Jack!

16:53.013 --> 16:56.515
It's like it never stopped
being the '70s down there.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.452
And a guy like Paul,
who can drive at night,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
You just don't say no
to that!

17:01.590 --> 17:02.822
Well, I apologize then.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.990
I thought we were going
to get through this together.

17:05.059 --> 17:06.993
I guess your coping mechanism

17:07.060 --> 17:09.462
Is to bring a married man
back to your hotel room!

17:09.529 --> 17:10.696
Coping?

17:10.765 --> 17:13.133
What am I supposed
to be coping with?

17:13.200 --> 17:16.403
It's the 35th anniversary
of dad leaving!

17:16.470 --> 17:18.839
Which time, Jack?

17:18.906 --> 17:21.876
That man left and came back
so many times

17:21.942 --> 17:23.678
That I totally lost count!

17:23.744 --> 17:26.750
One night,
he went out to move the car,

17:26.815 --> 17:28.148
And he was gone...

17:28.215 --> 17:31.085
From the spring of '57
until...

17:31.153 --> 17:34.021
One night he just
showed up out of the blue!

17:34.088 --> 17:35.490
"put your shoes on, Collie.

17:35.558 --> 17:37.392
<i>We're goin' to see
some like it hot."</i>

17:40.194 --> 17:42.495
You honestly don't remember
when he left for good,

17:42.564 --> 17:45.366
Because I sure as hell do.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.370
Oh, my god.
Is that what this is all about?

17:48.436 --> 17:52.006
Is that what you've been
holding onto all these years?

17:52.074 --> 17:56.544
Jack, stop wasting your time
thinking about that man!

17:56.612 --> 17:58.246
You're nothing like him,
you know.

17:58.314 --> 18:00.182
No way you ever could be.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.384
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.753
I'm old, Jack, you know?

18:04.821 --> 18:07.622
And I don't know what I'm
thinking about half the time.

18:07.690 --> 18:10.592
I do know this:

18:10.660 --> 18:13.596
You're my good boy.

18:13.662 --> 18:16.964
[voice breaking]
I just love ya to death.

18:19.670 --> 18:22.870
Thank you, mother.
And I love you too.

18:22.938 --> 18:24.540
Paul!

18:24.606 --> 18:26.540
You're on your own tonight.

18:26.609 --> 18:28.609
I have a date with my son.

18:28.676 --> 18:31.044
He's taking me out
to a late dinner.

18:31.112 --> 18:33.013
It's, uh, 6:00.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.652
Whoops!

18:39.822 --> 18:42.357
Say you like my body.

18:47.964 --> 18:49.264
[crying]
I don't wanna be here!

18:49.333 --> 18:52.034
I don't like it here!
Who's this guy?

18:52.101 --> 18:53.502
[sobbing]

18:56.506 --> 18:58.441
Okay, which one of us
is gonna give up first?

18:58.508 --> 19:00.075
The black one.
I can't take it anymore!

19:00.143 --> 19:01.411
I hate it!

19:01.478 --> 19:03.278
One of those strippers
took of Lutz's shirt.

19:03.346 --> 19:04.680
That gland thing
is no joke!

19:04.747 --> 19:06.950
Everything is upside down!

19:07.018 --> 19:08.351
We need to go back
to the way things were

19:08.418 --> 19:10.553
With both of us getting
preferential treatment.

19:10.622 --> 19:12.454
Yes. We upset
the natural order.

19:12.522 --> 19:15.423
You're going to strip clubs.
I'm up writing all night.

19:15.493 --> 19:17.593
Look who's a sailor!

19:17.661 --> 19:19.394
We're dressing monkeys up
as people,

19:19.462 --> 19:21.764
And monkeys are playing
with people as toys!

19:21.832 --> 19:23.399
It's not a toy, Tracy.

19:23.466 --> 19:26.467
Little Jenna thinks
that this is her baby.

19:26.536 --> 19:28.404
[screeching]

19:28.472 --> 19:31.141
- Oh, no!
- You said you loved me!

19:31.207 --> 19:32.908
Your foot fingers
are so strong!

19:32.976 --> 19:34.711
We don't wanna end up
like those two.

19:34.778 --> 19:38.880
You're so right.
[Jenna laughing]

19:38.949 --> 19:40.283
We're okay!

19:40.351 --> 19:41.918
He's just expressing himself!

19:41.985 --> 19:43.453
[monkey chittering]

19:43.521 --> 19:47.557
Hey, before you hear crazy
rumors and start believing them,

19:47.624 --> 19:49.459
The gibbon did not
attack Jenna.

19:49.527 --> 19:51.560
He was trying to mate
with her face.

19:51.628 --> 19:54.063
- What?
- Nothing. Everyone's fine.

19:54.132 --> 19:56.766
<i>Hey! Some like it hot.
I love this movie.</i>

19:56.834 --> 19:58.601
My mother told me
she and my dad

19:58.668 --> 20:00.903
Went to see it together,

20:00.971 --> 20:02.138
And if that's the stuff
she remembers,

20:02.205 --> 20:04.273
Maybe that's how
I should remember him too...

20:04.342 --> 20:07.744
On a date with my mom
instead of walking out the door.

20:07.812 --> 20:10.846
1959. Boy, it would have
been fun to write back then.

20:10.914 --> 20:13.449
You could get away
with crazy plot twists

20:13.516 --> 20:15.818
Because audiences were
so much less sophisticated.

20:15.886 --> 20:17.086
Wait a minute.

20:17.153 --> 20:19.955
This movie
came out in 1959?

20:20.024 --> 20:22.392
How could my father
have been gone

20:22.459 --> 20:25.494
From the spring of '57
until 1959

20:25.562 --> 20:29.531
If I was conceived in '58--

20:31.401 --> 20:33.167
Jimmy Donaghy's not my father.

20:33.236 --> 20:34.569
[gasps]
Twist!
