Bowery is faster, sir.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.134
Won't have a long wait

00:51.185 --> 00:54.104
I don't want faster. I enjoy waiting.

Please save my baby.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.471
Gentlemen,

04:15.506 --> 04:18.757
after two uneventful pregnancies,

04:18.809 --> 04:21.844
Mrs. Warren presented in her eighth month

04:21.894 --> 04:25.682
with what is assumed to be
a case of placenta previa.

04:25.684 --> 04:28.735
The hope had been to delay any procedure

04:28.769 --> 04:31.154
<i>for the benefit of the fetus.</i>

04:31.188 --> 04:34.490
<i>But circumstance has forced our hand.</i>

04:34.525 --> 04:38.778
Dr. Thackery and I have rehearsed
the newest techniques extensively

04:38.829 --> 04:43.199
and feel confident that the
speed necessary for success

04:43.250 --> 04:46.252
can finally be achieved.

04:48.672 --> 04:50.590
Surgical knife.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.995
100 seconds.

04:55.346 --> 04:56.763
100 seconds.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.182
100 seconds.

05:03.187 --> 05:05.855
I want the students to take
note that Dr. Christiansen

05:05.889 --> 05:09.559
is entering on the medial
line just above the pubis.

05:09.610 --> 05:13.229
We must be careful to
extract the fetus quickly

05:13.231 --> 05:18.034
and in such a manner so as not to
release pressure on the rupture,

05:18.068 --> 05:20.570
thus exacerbating
the hemorrhage.

05:20.572 --> 05:24.073
As you can see, there is
significant blood in the cavity.

05:24.075 --> 05:26.409
Vacuum, Everett.

05:30.047 --> 05:33.299
Though it's difficult to
see, it seems the fetus

05:33.334 --> 05:35.301
has migrated through the rupture

05:35.336 --> 05:37.970
upward toward the abdomen.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.757
We need to lengthen the incision
and get the baby out now.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.760
Jules.

05:43.844 --> 05:48.064
Nurse Monk, knife. Knife.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.068
Bertie, cauterize.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.073
<i>Monk: Her pulse is weakening.</i>

06:06.166 --> 06:08.668
- I have a leg.
- Pull the fetus down and out.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.786
It's trapped in the cord.

06:09.788 --> 06:12.004
Forceps clamps, umbilical scissors.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.123
Bertie.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.516
Come on, Thack.

06:28.105 --> 06:30.106
Scissors.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.444
- You're free.
- Tube it.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.652
More vacuum, Chickering.
Put your back into it.

06:45.489 --> 06:46.906
Her pulse has become eccentric.

06:46.957 --> 06:49.575
We still have time. Clamp that artery.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.003
Invert that section, Thack.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.227
There's the bleed.

07:09.813 --> 07:11.597
We can still close the rupture.

07:11.648 --> 07:12.682
Warren's needle and gut.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.851
Dowell's needle and silk.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.190
Good.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.694
Her pulse is faint and fully eccentric.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.779
<i>She's pallid and her lips are blue.</i>

07:26.830 --> 07:30.199
Pedals. One, two, three.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.709
Almost.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.512
Almost. Almost.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.049
There.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.436
The bleeding stopped.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.356
(cranking stops)

07:53.390 --> 07:56.559
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

07:58.562 --> 08:00.062
Nothing.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.416
It seems...

08:22.386 --> 08:26.305
it seems we are still lacking.

08:29.510 --> 08:33.095
I hope, if nothing else...

08:35.148 --> 08:38.017
<i>this has been instructive for you all.</i>

09:05.262 --> 09:06.963
We'll solve it.

09:08.432 --> 09:10.633
How many more, Thack?

09:10.684 --> 09:14.520
"And many strokes, though
with a little axe,

09:14.555 --> 09:16.856
hew down and fell

09:16.890 --> 09:20.309
the hardest timbered oak."

09:20.360 --> 09:24.564
Thus spake Thack the Wise.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.823
Jules.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.411
The procedure failed. You didn't.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.885
Thank you, my friend.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.597
♪ Isn't it a knobby one? ♪

09:57.648 --> 10:00.182

<i>(gun hammer clicks)</i>

10:35.052 --> 10:37.019
Fuck it all.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.729
<i>Thackery: Your god always wins.</i>

10:47.898 --> 10:49.899
<i>It is the longest unbeaten streak</i>

10:49.901 --> 10:52.335
in the history of the world.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.931
Yet J.M. Christiansen
fearlessly took up arms

10:57.957 --> 11:01.352
in that battle to oppose the inevitable.

11:01.378 --> 11:04.296
Throwing himself at an enemy
that has never known defeat

11:04.331 --> 11:07.750
and, as sure as I'm
standing here, never will.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.055
<i>One could not be blamed
for wondering if J.M.</i>

11:13.090 --> 11:16.175
<i>came to see his life's
work as a fool's errand.</i>

11:17.811 --> 11:21.347
<i>A rube... finally realizing</i>

11:21.398 --> 11:24.350
<i>that the game he's been playing
will be forever rigged against him.</i>

11:24.401 --> 11:26.769
<i>But my dear friend J.M.
was a fine man</i>

11:26.820 --> 11:29.071
and certainly was no fool or rube.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.912
He and I spent our lives tilting
at the very same windmills.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.584
So why have I not lost hope like he did?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.955
Because those windmills
at which we tilted

11:45.989 --> 11:48.007
were created by men to turn grindstones

11:48.041 --> 11:51.127
that transformed the
Earth's bounty into flour.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.381
From such humble beginnings

11:55.432 --> 11:59.068
grew the astonishing modern
world in which we now live.

11:59.102 --> 12:01.003
<i>We cannot conquer the mountains,</i>

12:01.038 --> 12:05.508
<i>but our railroads now run
through them with ease.</i>

12:05.542 --> 12:07.309
<i>We cannot defeat the river,</i>

12:07.344 --> 12:09.845
<i>but we can bend it to our will</i>

12:09.880 --> 12:12.214
<i>and dam it for our own purposes.</i>

12:14.701 --> 12:17.319
<i>We now live in a time</i>

12:17.370 --> 12:19.655
<i>of endless possibility.</i>

12:21.708 --> 12:24.493
More has been learned about the
treatment of the human body

12:24.495 --> 12:27.329
in the last five years than was
learned in the previous 500.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.582
20 years ago, 39 was the number of years

12:29.633 --> 12:31.000
a man could expect from his life.

12:31.051 --> 12:34.253
Today, it is more than 47.

12:34.304 --> 12:38.424
Eventually the train tunnels will crumble.

12:38.475 --> 12:41.010
The dams will be overrun.

12:42.512 --> 12:46.599
Our patients' hearts
will all stop their beating.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.854
But we humans can get in
a few good licks in battle

12:51.856 --> 12:54.073
before we surrender.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.162
<i>Catherine.</i>

13:02.499 --> 13:06.035
<i>I will not stop pushing
forward into a hopeful future.</i>

13:08.255 --> 13:11.207
And with every blow I land,

13:11.258 --> 13:14.543
every extra year I give to a patient...

13:16.513 --> 13:19.298
I will remember my fallen friend

13:19.349 --> 13:22.551
Jules Michael Christiansen...

13:24.354 --> 13:26.472
<i>and know that at the very least,</i>

13:26.523 --> 13:30.643
<i>something, however temporary...</i>

13:33.697 --> 13:35.815
has been won.

13:40.871 --> 13:43.239
<i>(bell tolling)</i>

13:47.244 --> 13:49.245
Lovely eulogy, Dr. Thackery.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.462
Thank you.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.631
If not a bit self-aggrandizing.

13:52.666 --> 13:56.802
And another chance for him to trumpet
his personal war against God.

13:56.837 --> 14:00.222
Good afternoon, Miss Robertson.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.675
- Sister.
- Mr. Barrow.

14:02.726 --> 14:05.394
It was a lovely funeral.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.648
As these things go.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.019
The minister was very eloquent, Sister.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.739
Protestants have their moments, too.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.691
(chuckles) Yes.

14:18.742 --> 14:21.610
You should come to one of our
Sunday services, Sister.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.829
Very God-fearing.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.618
Good day to you both.

14:31.588 --> 14:35.457
The whole event is just completely tragic

14:35.459 --> 14:38.127
and quite shocking.

14:38.129 --> 14:42.514
Who would have guessed Dr.
Christiansen was so hopelessly lost?

14:42.549 --> 14:46.518
<i>Cornelia: 12 attempts at the
same surgery with no survivors</i>

14:46.553 --> 14:48.520
would drive any good man mad.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.972
Of course.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.776
His anguish is over, but
hers is just beginning.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.279
Though I understand
he left her a sizable sum.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.448
Enough to keep a widow warm at night?

14:59.482 --> 15:02.067
And to attract the right type of suitor.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.037
She is still a handsome woman.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.706
Always surprised by your sensitivity.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.792
Thank you.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.667
How were the proceedings?

15:18.669 --> 15:21.937
I'm guessing they chose
to go closed casket today.

15:21.972 --> 15:25.174
Yes, Mr. Cleary, the
casket was closed today.

15:25.208 --> 15:28.143
Ah, well, the worms will be thankful
for the extra holes, though.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.679
Saves them from having to
make 'em for themselves.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.398
<i>(chuckles)</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:35.351
Ah, Sister, don't judge me too harsh.

15:35.402 --> 15:39.188
I'm just a poor simple sinner
in the eyes of the Lord.

15:39.190 --> 15:41.523
The Lord loves all His children equally.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.026
Though in your case, Mr. Cleary,

15:44.077 --> 15:46.862
I'm sure He'll make an exception.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.580
(sighs)

15:48.615 --> 15:51.250
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

15:54.421 --> 15:56.956
Ambulance.

15:57.007 --> 15:58.707
Right.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.709
We got one.

16:08.385 --> 16:10.803
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

16:12.272 --> 16:14.606
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.975
Miss Telfer.

16:16.026 --> 16:18.477
My father sends his regrets
that he can't be here today,

16:18.528 --> 16:20.813
so I'll be sitting in as his proxy.

16:20.864 --> 16:22.231
(men laugh)

16:22.282 --> 16:24.066
Signed by Captain Robertson.

16:24.117 --> 16:27.069
Perhaps we should adjourn, then,
till the captain can be here

16:27.071 --> 16:29.204
- and we're able to do this properly.
- Yes.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.874
If you strongly object to my
father's wishes, Mr. Habershorn,

16:31.908 --> 16:35.327
I will understand if you need to
make your apologies and leave.

16:37.714 --> 16:41.417
Then let's get to the business at hand.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.503
I'd like to welcome Dr. Thackery
to his first board meeting,

16:44.554 --> 16:47.089
seated in place of
the late Dr. Christiansen.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.725
My condolences, Dr. Thackery.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.895
Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing

16:52.929 --> 16:54.980
has brought added strain
to the Knickerbocker.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.399
Aside from the public disaster it presents,

16:57.434 --> 16:59.902
it further hampers our
efforts at financial solidity.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.938
As you can see, gentlemen, in the
published reports in front of you,

17:02.940 --> 17:05.491
monthly costs have increased.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.910
This is due in part to
the recent renovations

17:07.944 --> 17:09.994
in the men's and women's wards.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.281
The hospital is now running at a deficit

17:12.282 --> 17:15.501
of nearly $30,000 a year.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.286
Now, in light of this,

17:17.288 --> 17:19.288
I've taken the liberty of postponing

17:19.339 --> 17:21.507
the much needed repairs in the courtyard.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.459
Now, Dr. Thackery,

17:23.461 --> 17:26.045
as you were Dr. Christiansen's
Deputy Chief of Surgery,

17:26.096 --> 17:28.964
the board would like you to step
into his position as Chief.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.550
<i>We'd be grateful if you'd accept.</i>

17:31.601 --> 17:33.635
I will, though with great regret.

17:33.637 --> 17:37.056
Which means you'll be needing a new deputy.

17:37.107 --> 17:39.224
I'm sure we all agree

17:39.275 --> 17:42.144
that Dr. Gallinger is the
right man for the job.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.313
I'm not sure we all agree on that.

17:44.364 --> 17:48.283
<i>My father and I would like you
to consider another candidate.</i>

17:48.318 --> 17:51.320
Based on what? Your surgical expertise?

17:51.371 --> 17:55.290
Based on our faith in the man.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.659
Dr. Algernon Edwards. Mr. Barrow.

17:57.710 --> 18:01.497
He received his medical
education at Harvard College,

18:01.548 --> 18:03.665
graduating with distinction.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.752
His training was done at Boston
Hospital and then Providence.

18:06.803 --> 18:09.888
And he spent the past four
years working and instructing

18:09.923 --> 18:13.058
at St. Thomas Hospital in London
under Sir William MacCormac,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.227
President of the Royal College of Surgeons

18:15.261 --> 18:19.014
and at the Institut Pasteur in
France under Albert Calmette.

18:19.065 --> 18:22.184
He has more knowledge
of recent surgical advances

18:22.186 --> 18:24.019
in Europe than any man in the country.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.904
And his return to the States provides us

18:25.939 --> 18:27.856
with a great opportunity, Thack.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.576
Cornelia and her father
have prevailed upon him

18:30.610 --> 18:32.578
to travel to New York tomorrow,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.830
as we assumed you would
want to meet with him.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.249
He seems very qualified.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.084
Then I shall arrange
for him to meet with you.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.586
Arrange or insist?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.538
<i>Barrow: I think you can
find a few minutes</i>

18:42.589 --> 18:45.541
<i>for a candidate of this caliber.</i>

18:45.592 --> 18:47.759
Considering all the
Robertsons have done for us,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.796
<i>it would be foolish not
to respect their opinion</i>

18:50.847 --> 18:52.931
<i>and entertain the possibility.</i>

18:52.966 --> 18:56.268
Far be it for me
to be foolish, Herman.

18:57.687 --> 19:00.973
I will meet the man, but my choice is firm.

19:01.024 --> 19:02.975
It's Gallinger.

19:06.696 --> 19:08.530
(groaning)

19:09.899 --> 19:13.569
Ah, and a good day to you, Pete.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.287
- How you doing there, fella?
- (groans)

19:15.321 --> 19:18.824
(laughs) Got a nice little
package there for us?

19:26.799 --> 19:28.750
You're not getting this one, Cleary.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.419
<i>(laughs) Oh, Pete.</i>

19:30.421 --> 19:32.471
Can't we be reasonable?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.923
Talk about this like gentlemen?

19:34.925 --> 19:37.426
Now, as to my mind,

19:37.477 --> 19:39.011
you can either give us the goods,

19:39.062 --> 19:41.763
or youse can all travel
to the Knick as patients.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.683
Cleary: Hooked a fine one.

19:44.734 --> 19:46.768
Banker from up 5th Avenue.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.687
Liver problems. Jaundice.

19:48.738 --> 19:50.405
Pissing blood, he says.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.241
I'm sure this one will be
in a private with us

19:52.275 --> 19:54.243
for a few weeks and be
paying his bill in full.

19:54.277 --> 19:57.329
- Nice catch.
- That's two more bits for Cleary.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.414
(chuckles)

19:59.449 --> 20:01.500
End of the month.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.015
Another beautiful day
at the Knick, Nurse Elkins?

20:18.968 --> 20:20.636
Ma'am.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.521
Dr. Gallinger.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.274
This is Mr. Sebastiano Gentile. 40.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.476
On the eighth of this month
he was struck by a streetcar,

20:27.478 --> 20:29.061
fracturing his pelvis.

20:29.112 --> 20:32.981
Mr. Gentile, don't you know never
to quarrel with a streetcar?

20:32.983 --> 20:34.900
I've never known a man to beat one yet.

20:34.951 --> 20:37.152
I know that now.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.655
Next time, take on one of
those horseless carriages.

20:39.657 --> 20:41.490
Much better odds.

20:41.492 --> 20:43.458
Upon arrival, an extensive wound

20:43.493 --> 20:44.773
on the lateral side of his thigh

20:44.794 --> 20:46.411
was immediately stitched and dressed.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.548
Pulse was 112. Abdomen was tympanitic.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.750
And there was tenderness
below the umbilicus.

20:51.801 --> 20:54.386
So he was taken into
the operating theater,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.004
where we found four puncture wounds

20:56.006 --> 20:57.923
from the fractured pelvic
bone lacerating the bowel.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.892
And with Dr. Chickering assisting,
we immediately sutured the wounds

21:00.927 --> 21:03.395
using three catgut
sutures on each puncture.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.597
Was there any consideration

21:05.648 --> 21:08.100
of removing the damaged
section of the bowel?

21:09.512 --> 21:11.353
The difficulty in
reconnecting the two new ends

21:11.355 --> 21:13.188
of the intestines seemed too great

21:13.190 --> 21:14.856
and the danger of
post-operative bowel leakage

21:14.858 --> 21:16.358
was another complication we discussed.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.910
And I dared not risk a resection.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.530
Any complications thus far?

21:21.532 --> 21:24.533
Mr. Gentile has developed
a small case of bronchitis,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.336
which is common after such a procedure.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.955
Very good, Doctor.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.314
Clogs.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.992
Which nurse changed
the dressings on this man?

22:08.745 --> 22:10.495
<i>I did.</i>

22:16.586 --> 22:18.920
Per Dr. Gallinger's instructions.

22:18.922 --> 22:21.840
Twice in the past 24 hours

22:21.891 --> 22:23.592
and I emptied his drains
throughout the night.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.511
And did you recently empty that one?

22:26.562 --> 22:27.929
I didn't.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.931
It's tended to have
collected very little fluid.

22:29.933 --> 22:33.185
And yet the area where the drain
exits the wound is swollen.

22:33.236 --> 22:37.105
Perhaps you might have considered
clearing the drainage tube of clogs.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.025
<i>How long have you been here?</i>

22:40.076 --> 22:42.411
Almost three weeks.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.995
Then you should already know, Nurse Elkins,

22:44.030 --> 22:45.914
that the goal is to keep
the patients alive,

22:45.948 --> 22:47.282
not kill them with negligence

22:47.333 --> 22:49.534
<i>after a surgeon's done
his best to save them.</i>

22:49.585 --> 22:54.122
I expect everyone to be well
versed in their responsibilities.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.624
I'm sorry.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.293
No, weakness and self-pity
have no place on my ward.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.095
If I'm asking too much of you,

23:00.129 --> 23:03.014
you can always take the
donkey cart back to Kentucky

23:03.049 --> 23:05.133
<i>and continue in the fine
tradition of curing people</i>

23:05.135 --> 23:08.887
with moonshine and angleworm poultices.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.531
Rest up, Mr. Gentile.

23:19.565 --> 23:23.652
You got a lot more trolleys
to dodge in your future.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.377
The joke's on Thackery.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.996
He doesn't know you're
from West Virginia.

23:39.135 --> 23:41.253
<i>(siren wailing)</i>

23:53.266 --> 23:55.233
(coughing)

23:56.986 --> 23:58.854
Cleary: Jesus, Speight.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.022
You sure it's not you with
the fucking tuberculosis?

24:01.024 --> 24:02.657
Watch your mouth, Cleary.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.444
There's plenty of other stretcher
boys I can call for this.

24:12.835 --> 24:15.704
- (knocks)
- Health Inspector.

24:17.039 --> 24:19.708
Health Inspector. Open the door, please.

24:19.742 --> 24:21.843
<i>(woman coughing)</i>

24:28.518 --> 24:30.602
Hmm.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.360
Mrs. Krawetz?

24:38.394 --> 24:41.112
We're here to take you to the hospital.
Do you understand?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.815
<i>Hospital.</i>

24:43.866 --> 24:45.984
Hos... hospital.

24:46.035 --> 24:48.119
She has a disease. She
must be taken out of here.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.789
Christ alive, it's the Tower
of Babel in these shitholes.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.909
Never the same language twice. Hospital!

24:53.911 --> 24:56.545
My father says he doesn't
want you taking my mother.

24:56.579 --> 24:59.998
Well, I'm Officer Sears of the
New York Police Department

25:00.049 --> 25:02.330
and there is a law that says
we have to take her someplace

25:02.335 --> 25:05.420
that'll make her well so she
doesn't get you sick, too.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.173
(speaking Latvian)

25:13.846 --> 25:15.363
My...

25:15.398 --> 25:19.267
my father says they took our
neighbor and he never came back.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.486
Oh, she'll be back and fit as a fiddle.

25:21.521 --> 25:22.771
You watch.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.773
No windows, no ventilation,

25:24.824 --> 25:26.942
no sunlight inside, no running water.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.410
A breeding ground for disease.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.495
That's why the new laws were passed.

25:30.530 --> 25:34.032
I can compel you to make any
and all structural changes

25:34.083 --> 25:37.369
to your property I deem
necessary to protect the public.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.287
That will cost a fortune.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.206
I'm a businessman.

25:41.257 --> 25:43.625
Blame Lister's microscope and Riis' camera.

25:43.676 --> 25:46.761
The New York City Health
Department is just doing its job.

25:49.048 --> 25:52.884
You own two more buildings
on this block, don't you?

25:52.935 --> 25:54.803
(sighs)

25:54.805 --> 25:57.439
Perhaps we can come to
some other arrangement.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.608
Perhaps we can.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.486
<i>Man: It's the last of the six loads.</i>

26:11.537 --> 26:14.489
<i>Keep your boilers cooking
for the next four months.</i>

26:14.491 --> 26:16.324
<i>Barrow: Three cents a pound?</i>

26:16.375 --> 26:18.243
<i>Man: Sounds good.</i>

26:18.294 --> 26:22.163
<i>Barrow: That is excellent, Mr. Corker.</i>

26:22.214 --> 26:25.917
<i>Here is a bank draft
from the Knickerbocker</i>

26:25.968 --> 26:28.136
<i>for the full amount.</i>

26:28.170 --> 26:30.722
Thank you for choosing Parkhurst.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.675
Mr. Parkhurst is grateful
for your business.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.846
And I am grateful for his.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.848
Pardon me, gentlemen.

26:39.850 --> 26:42.601
Where might I find Dr. John Thackery?

26:45.354 --> 26:47.656
- Down there.
- Let's go, guys.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.524
Come on.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.106
Dr. Thackery?

27:21.140 --> 27:22.691
Yes.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.111
I was told I could find you here.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.313
I'm Algernon Edwards.

27:37.907 --> 27:40.208
Would you prefer for me
to wait in your office?

27:40.242 --> 27:41.743
No, this is fine.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.914
May I ask what it is you're making?

27:45.965 --> 27:49.668
It's an idea for an
improvement on an instrument.

27:49.719 --> 27:51.836
(hissing)

27:51.887 --> 27:56.391
A colleague of mine in London was
very fond of smelting as well.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.760
In fact, the harelip forceps he modified

27:58.811 --> 28:00.261
is now the standard in Europe.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.764
Well, if I find myself on the Continent

28:02.815 --> 28:06.935
working on a harelip, I
will know who to thank.

28:08.771 --> 28:12.741
I'm beginning to think you were
not told everything about me.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.859
You envisioned something
different, I take it.

28:14.910 --> 28:17.328
<i>Something lighter.</i>

28:17.363 --> 28:19.698
I did.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.534
And to be frank, Dr. Edwards,

28:22.585 --> 28:25.286
I only agreed to this meeting as
a courtesy to Miss Robertson,

28:25.337 --> 28:27.372
but I am certainly not interested

28:27.423 --> 28:30.041
in an integrated hospital staff.

28:30.092 --> 28:31.960
<i>My skin color shouldn't matter.</i>

28:31.962 --> 28:34.679
Well, if it doesn't matter, then why was
that information held back from me?

28:34.714 --> 28:36.631
You'll have to ask Miss Robertson.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.967
It's also nowhere to be
found on your credentials.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.519
Is your race listed on yours?

28:41.554 --> 28:43.722
There's no need for it to be.

28:46.776 --> 28:49.227
<i>I grant that your
background is impressive,</i>

28:49.278 --> 28:51.613
and I'm sure there are
many Negro infirmaries

28:51.647 --> 28:52.864
that will benefit from your talents,

28:52.898 --> 28:54.783
<i>- But this hospital...
- You're here.</i>

28:54.817 --> 28:57.118
This is where I'd like to be.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.704
<i>If you would just give me a chance.</i>

28:59.739 --> 29:02.323
<i>In London and in Paris,
I was treated as an equal.</i>

29:02.374 --> 29:04.159
<i>- And I have no doubt...
- This is New York.</i>

29:04.161 --> 29:06.661
This is not London or Paris.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.832
You can only run away and join the circus

29:10.883 --> 29:13.001
if the circus wants you.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.639
I don't want you in my circus.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.928
Dr. Edwards.

29:23.979 --> 29:26.347
How was your meeting with Dr. Thackery?

29:26.349 --> 29:28.933
Wonderful if you call being humiliated

29:28.984 --> 29:31.186
in front of a 1,000-degree
furnace a meeting.

29:31.237 --> 29:33.104
What do you mean?

29:33.155 --> 29:34.823
Thank your father for me.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.574
I'm going to head back to Boston.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.993
Sorry if I wasted your time.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.862
I certainly wasted mine.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.697
Dr. Edwards.

29:42.699 --> 29:44.833
Dr. Edwards.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.668
Algernon.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.920
Miss Robertson.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.707
Dr. Chickering would like to see you.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.643
- Inspector Speight.
- Mr. Barrow.

30:14.897 --> 30:16.564
<i>How are things on the streets?</i>

30:16.615 --> 30:18.233
Getting worse every day.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.151
The more boatloads they let in,

30:20.202 --> 30:22.320
the more pestilence infects the city.

30:22.371 --> 30:25.406
I had three cases of
tuberculosis just today.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.909
The poor are just weaker than us.

30:29.101 --> 30:31.021
You'd imagine the mayor
would want to think about

30:31.046 --> 30:34.332
sending them immigrants
elsewhere, but he don't stop 'em.

30:34.383 --> 30:36.634
Shipping companies see to that.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.887
Some of these diseases,
they spread so quick,

30:38.921 --> 30:41.422
they wipe out whole blocks of
people in just a few days.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.592
We have to burn the bodies.
We have no place to put them.

30:49.265 --> 30:52.600
<i>- That a new one of your kids?
- Yes.</i>

30:53.485 --> 30:55.603
<i>Handsome-looking family.</i>

30:55.605 --> 30:57.605
Always wanted to have
one of those done of me.

30:57.607 --> 30:59.607
And why haven't you?

30:59.609 --> 31:02.110
Don't think I could sit still that long.

31:02.112 --> 31:04.245
What if I had to use the toilet?

31:04.280 --> 31:07.282
<i>Those frames look like
they set you back a bit.</i>

31:07.333 --> 31:08.783
<i>Gold leaf?</i>

31:08.785 --> 31:12.120
Where did you say you sent
these tuberculosis patients?

31:12.122 --> 31:14.005
The Knick got one.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.625
City's gonna cover the full freight
cost since I put her here.

31:17.676 --> 31:20.545
And you want a finder's fee.

31:20.596 --> 31:22.797
<i>Could have easily sent her to St. Vincent's</i>

31:22.799 --> 31:24.265
<i>or Presbyterian.</i>

31:24.300 --> 31:26.935
<i>Next time could be none.</i>

31:26.969 --> 31:28.803
<i>Or it might be all of them.</i>

31:28.805 --> 31:30.555
You know, I like you, Herm.

31:30.606 --> 31:32.640
We're cut from the same cloth.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.111
I like to think not.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.447
(raspy breathing)

31:41.817 --> 31:43.701
<i>Bertie: It's not good.</i>

31:43.736 --> 31:45.486
The tuberculosis is pretty advanced.

31:45.488 --> 31:47.238
Her lungs are completely full of fluid.

31:47.289 --> 31:50.158
Fever of 104. Pulse is erratic.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.576
Her fingers are clubbing.

31:51.627 --> 31:54.128
Are you recommending a sanitarium stay?

31:54.163 --> 31:57.248
She's already on the other
side of the hill, I'm afraid.

31:57.299 --> 32:01.169
I honestly don't think she'll
make it through the week.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.670
Does she know?

32:02.721 --> 32:04.639
She doesn't speak English.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.008
Her daughter has been interpreting for me.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.260
I see.

32:09.311 --> 32:11.062
Responsibility is to the patient,

32:11.096 --> 32:13.648
but there's no rule that says we have to...

32:17.937 --> 32:20.071
Hello.

32:23.492 --> 32:26.027
<i>(coughing)</i>

32:26.029 --> 32:27.612
May I ask your name?

32:27.663 --> 32:29.364
- Yetta.
- Yetta.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.449
A beautiful name.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.035
Yetta, my name is Miss Robertson.

32:34.037 --> 32:37.705
I'm from the social welfare
office of the hospital.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.591
I need your help right now

32:40.626 --> 32:42.710
to explain something to your mother.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.879
All right?

32:46.181 --> 32:48.683
Please tell your mother
that the doctor says

32:48.717 --> 32:50.635
her disease has made her very sick.

32:50.686 --> 32:53.354
(speaking Latvian)

32:54.556 --> 32:57.141
<i>She will not get better.</i>

32:57.192 --> 32:59.060
(speaking Latvian)

32:59.062 --> 33:01.479
<i>She will only get worse.</i>

33:01.530 --> 33:03.648
<i>But the hospital will do all it can</i>

33:03.699 --> 33:06.567
to make her as comfortable as possible.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.822
(speaking Latvian)

33:13.909 --> 33:17.078
If there is anything
she or your family needs,

33:17.129 --> 33:18.913
we are here to help you.

33:18.915 --> 33:21.249
Does she understand?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.634
(speaking Latvian)

33:29.475 --> 33:31.592
She understands.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.512
I'm so sorry.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.598
(speaking Latvian)

33:37.649 --> 33:40.151
My mother wants to know
what time it is.

33:43.739 --> 33:45.990
It's 4:30.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.076
(speaking Latvian)

33:52.114 --> 33:54.165
My mother says I should go

33:54.199 --> 33:56.451
or else I'll be late for my shift.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.050
Keller Shirtwaist Factory on Delancey.

34:12.101 --> 34:13.801
Be sure she gets there safely, Jesse.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.969
Yes, ma'am. (kissing noises)

34:29.650 --> 34:31.985
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

34:32.036 --> 34:33.987
(knocks)

34:34.039 --> 34:36.958
I expected you over an hour ago.
What kept you?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.377
Your treatment of
Dr. Edwards was indefensible.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.161
No, it was completely defensible.

34:41.164 --> 34:43.164
<i>I'll tell you exactly what I told him.</i>

34:43.215 --> 34:46.501
I'm not interested in leading
the charge in mixing the races.

34:46.503 --> 34:49.469
Dr. Edwards is as capable as
any doctor in this hospital.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.639
- Likely more so.
- Perhaps.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.757
But just as a shopkeeper
would never stock an item

34:53.809 --> 34:55.760
on his shelves no customer would buy,

34:55.811 --> 34:58.262
I would not employ a surgeon no patient

34:58.313 --> 34:59.597
will agree to have operate them.

34:59.648 --> 35:01.732
Then patients must be
convinced of his ability.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.651
Are you going to stand
there and honestly tell me

35:03.685 --> 35:05.436
that the way out of our financial troubles

35:05.487 --> 35:07.438
is to hire a Negro surgeon?

35:07.489 --> 35:10.491
Once people learn that
he is an excellent surgeon,

35:10.526 --> 35:11.859
they'll change their minds.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.028
We're speaking about a
patient's possible mortality.

35:14.030 --> 35:17.115
Is this really a fair time
to begin a social crusade?

35:17.166 --> 35:20.251
- Yes.
- We're an institution in dire condition.

35:21.787 --> 35:24.705
We're not an incubator for
some progressive experiment

35:24.756 --> 35:26.374
<i>for you and your father's money.</i>

35:26.425 --> 35:30.428
Please, find yourself another hobby.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.883
- Got it?
- Yeah.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.438
Do you see what you've done?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.974
The Robertsons are pulling their crews.

35:43.025 --> 35:45.393
They're terminating the
electrification project.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.728
Oh, so childish.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.231
No, Thack, you're the child.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.900
We need their money. We need to electrify.

35:52.951 --> 35:54.735
I'm not hiring the Negro.

35:54.737 --> 35:58.906
Do you think I want that dusky
coon roaming these halls?

35:58.957 --> 36:00.908
A man of high rank on our staff

36:00.959 --> 36:03.077
who will repel patients?

36:03.128 --> 36:07.832
I need you happy, but right now
I need the Robertsons happier.

36:07.883 --> 36:10.418
You know we have no choice.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.753
The man will be hired.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.006
Then I'll resign.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.225
Again?

36:26.485 --> 36:29.103
(whimpering)

36:35.027 --> 36:38.446
I want you to stay like that for
20 minutes, Mrs. Eberhardt.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.499
Nurse Connelly will
keep massaging your belly.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.867
Trust an old midwife.

36:42.918 --> 36:45.002
That breech baby will
turn around in no time

36:45.037 --> 36:46.754
to get away from the cold.

36:46.788 --> 36:49.123
Is this something the doctor prescribed?

36:49.125 --> 36:51.626
He would if he knew what he was doing.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.802
<i>(Cleary laughing)</i>

37:09.811 --> 37:11.812
Oh, I envy that cigarette.

37:11.814 --> 37:14.282
Nice and slow. Nice and slow.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.617
(laughs)

37:16.652 --> 37:18.986
Ah, the poor Lord's got all
these ladies married to Him

37:18.988 --> 37:21.038
and none will give Him a go.

37:21.073 --> 37:25.493
Hey, do penguins ever just
want to go for a good poke?

37:25.544 --> 37:27.578
Oh, we get curious.

37:27.629 --> 37:30.831
But then they show us a
photograph of your sorry face

37:30.833 --> 37:33.551
and we all run right back
into the arms of God.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.504
<i>Your ugly mug's responsible for more girls</i>

37:36.506 --> 37:38.639
<i>staying virgins than the chastity belt.</i>

37:38.674 --> 37:41.008
(laughs)

37:50.569 --> 37:52.820
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

38:07.669 --> 38:09.370
<i>(clock chimes)</i>

38:16.962 --> 38:20.097
<i>(footsteps)</i>

38:34.363 --> 38:37.648
How in God's name

38:37.699 --> 38:39.784
are you still going?

38:39.818 --> 38:43.871
I have an insatiable desire for fame.

38:45.707 --> 38:47.908
And, of course...

38:48.827 --> 38:52.463
my old friend

38:52.497 --> 38:54.382
Uncle Parker.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.599
<i>I'd love to have your help
for this next part.</i>

39:11.650 --> 39:15.436
Unless, of course, you'd
rather go back to sleep.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.826
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

39:26.615 --> 39:28.749
<i>Lucy: His temperature is 105</i>

39:28.784 --> 39:30.785
<i>and his pulse is rapid at 166.</i>

39:30.787 --> 39:33.454
He has vomited three times
in the last 90 minutes.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.457
I figured his bronchitis was
worsening, so I summoned you.

39:36.459 --> 39:38.676
It's not his bronchitis. It's septicemia.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.127
The swelling of the limbs.

39:40.129 --> 39:42.546
The discoloration has started, too.

39:42.597 --> 39:43.964
My repair didn't hold.

39:44.015 --> 39:47.134
He's leaking his own bowel
poisons into his blood.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.720
I should have resected.

39:49.771 --> 39:51.639
It would have happened with any surgeon,

39:51.690 --> 39:53.441
Thackery included.

39:53.475 --> 39:57.144
<i>Barrow: Most of our patients will
receive their treatment here</i>

39:57.195 --> 39:59.397
in the men's ward.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.233
Ah, allow me to introduce you

40:02.284 --> 40:05.820
to two of your junior surgeons.

40:05.822 --> 40:08.155
Good morning to you all.

40:08.157 --> 40:11.075
Dr. Everett K. Gallinger
and Dr. Bertram Chickering Jr.

40:11.126 --> 40:14.161
This is our new assistant chief surgeon

40:14.212 --> 40:16.330
Dr. Algernon Edwards.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.383
Thackery hired him?

40:19.418 --> 40:22.253
<i>Directed me to do it
as of late yesterday.</i>

40:24.389 --> 40:26.590
Everyone calls me Bertie.

40:26.641 --> 40:28.225
Feel free yourself.

40:30.679 --> 40:32.813
Welcome to our circus.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.567
It seems we need to head
back inside the tent.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.519
Excuse me.

40:41.656 --> 40:44.952
Bertie: Septicemia
following a bowel repair.

40:44.978 --> 40:45.801
Mm.

40:48.841 --> 40:50.841
We need to go back in
and find the leak right away.

40:50.866 --> 40:54.535
We? He is my patient,
Doctor, not yours.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.170
We can't go back in. Bronchitis.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.838
The ether will kill him.

40:57.873 --> 40:59.373
Get Dr. Thackery.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.091
I don't believe he's come in yet.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.711
Then find him, please.

41:03.762 --> 41:05.379
Time is precious.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.881
He's dying in front of our eyes.

41:06.883 --> 41:08.215
Surely we can solve this ourselves?

41:08.217 --> 41:10.384
- You'll solve nothing.
- Doctor.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.721
He needs an immediate resection.

41:13.772 --> 41:17.107
Two slippery pieces of bowel, wet noodles

41:17.142 --> 41:18.893
somehow sutured perfectly together

41:18.895 --> 41:20.895
while septic fluids leak
all over the cavity

41:20.897 --> 41:22.313
poisoning the patient.

41:22.364 --> 41:24.031
That is if we are somehow
able to bring about

41:24.065 --> 41:25.649
surgical sleep without killing the man.

41:25.700 --> 41:28.819
<i>- Nurse Elkins.
- Yes?</i>

41:28.870 --> 41:31.572
Bertie and I will prepare
Mr. Gentile for the surgery.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.991
I need you to find Dr. Thackery.
Try his home first.

41:34.042 --> 41:36.410
We don't have a minute to spare.
Now, excuse me.

41:37.746 --> 41:41.168
Lucy, do you know where he lives?

41:41.169 --> 41:44.084
- No.
- 28 Waverly.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.554
Lucy, do you know where that is?

41:46.588 --> 41:48.138
No.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.925
West, then left on Wooster Street
towards Washington Square.

41:56.765 --> 41:58.933
Welcome to the Knick.

42:23.758 --> 42:25.843
(pounding)

42:28.213 --> 42:30.214
Dr. Thackery?

42:44.980 --> 42:47.147
Dr. Thackery?

42:49.985 --> 42:52.653
Dr. Thackery?

42:54.573 --> 42:57.908
Dr. Thackery, you're urgently
needed for a procedure.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.841
Good Lord, Dr. Thackery.

43:13.843 --> 43:15.976
Go away.

43:16.011 --> 43:18.145
Please go away.

43:20.015 --> 43:22.182
Dr. Gallinger sent me.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.153
A patient is dying.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.355
Which one?

43:28.357 --> 43:31.191
Mr...

43:31.242 --> 43:33.694
Mr. Gentile.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.664
He has septicemia.

43:36.698 --> 43:38.866
Oh, fucking Gallinger.

43:40.869 --> 43:43.037
What's wrong with you? Are you sick?

43:45.874 --> 43:49.460
I was trying to spend a night without it.

43:49.511 --> 43:51.545
Without what?

43:53.765 --> 43:56.133
(clatters)

43:59.054 --> 44:01.522
Nurse, I need your assistance.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.477
You need to inject me.

44:07.896 --> 44:10.114
I can't do it.

44:17.989 --> 44:20.124
Cocaine?

44:22.410 --> 44:24.578
How much? I don't want to kill you.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.914
A touch more than 22.

44:47.519 --> 44:49.103
You've destroyed yourself, Doctor.

44:49.154 --> 44:51.438
- You're collapsed everywhere.
- Toes.

44:59.948 --> 45:02.249
- They're too small.
- Not for me. It's fine.

45:02.283 --> 45:04.785
- I don't think I can.
- Oh, for God's sake.

45:06.121 --> 45:08.505
- What are you doing?
- You want a bigger vein?

45:08.540 --> 45:11.258
- You want me to inject your...
- Yes, on the underside.

45:11.292 --> 45:13.844
The urethral.

45:13.878 --> 45:16.130
- Nurse.
- (sighs)

45:16.132 --> 45:17.931
Do it!

45:17.966 --> 45:20.134
Lord forgive me.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.889
(groans)

45:29.861 --> 45:31.812
Gentlemen, atomizers on.

45:31.863 --> 45:35.032
Everyone scrubbed, washed, cleansed,

45:35.066 --> 45:38.368
deloused, purified by God?

45:38.403 --> 45:40.788
- Gallinger: All except the last, Thack.
- What's he doing here?

45:40.822 --> 45:43.657
- You hired him.
- I'm here to assist in the surgery.

45:43.659 --> 45:45.659
- He's not touching me.
- Don't worry, Mr. Gentile.

45:45.710 --> 45:47.327
He won't be. Everett,
you'll be assisting me.

45:47.329 --> 45:48.912
Bertie, you'll back up Everett.

45:48.963 --> 45:50.631
Thack, we can't use ether
on account of his lungs

45:50.665 --> 45:52.166
and we can't operate
on a man who's awake.

45:52.217 --> 45:54.384
I know. I was considering
this on the way in.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.003
You could try Nirvanin on the abdomen.

45:56.005 --> 45:57.588
There's some success in Germany.

45:57.639 --> 45:59.339
In dental surgery.
For something like this,

45:59.390 --> 46:01.175
it won't penetrate to the necessary depth.

46:01.226 --> 46:03.594
Nurse Elkins, would you
prepare a spinal needle

46:03.645 --> 46:07.397
and a hypodermic of 10
of a 2% cocaine solution?

46:10.185 --> 46:12.186
Are you not familiar with the drug?

46:12.220 --> 46:14.104
I am.

46:14.155 --> 46:16.106
Then prepare it. I didn't hire him.

46:16.157 --> 46:18.826
Barrow forced him upon me.
He's the new assistant chief.

46:18.860 --> 46:20.994
I was told you had decided
to offer me the position.

46:21.029 --> 46:23.247
Well, if Barrow told it
to you, you should know

46:23.281 --> 46:24.865
<i>there is never likely
to be much truth in it.</i>

46:24.916 --> 46:28.202
- (men laugh)
- I will not stay where I'm not wanted.

46:28.204 --> 46:31.538
Then I'm guessing you don't
stay anywhere for very long.

46:33.341 --> 46:35.292
As per my oath, I will
remain in the theater

46:35.343 --> 46:36.877
until the patient is out of danger.

46:36.879 --> 46:38.428
And then I will resign.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.048
Congratulations, Everett,
on your new promotion.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.600
Mr. Gentile, we're going
to sit you up.

46:43.635 --> 46:45.886
- Everett, Bertie.
- Uh, what are we doing?

46:45.937 --> 46:47.888
Sit him up. Arch his back forward.

46:47.939 --> 46:50.641
Nurse Monk, pencil,
sponge with antiseptic.

46:50.692 --> 46:54.394
Gentlemen, before you is a patient

46:54.445 --> 46:56.864
who is infected with
septicemia from his bowel.

46:56.898 --> 46:59.700
Normally, we would induce
surgical sleep with ether,

46:59.734 --> 47:01.652
but due to a severe case of bronchitis

47:01.703 --> 47:04.071
he has developed
post-operatively, we cannot.

47:04.073 --> 47:07.791
We must operate, but we cannot do
it to a man who can feel pain.

47:07.826 --> 47:10.127
My solution...

47:10.161 --> 47:12.746
numb the nerves in the spine

47:12.797 --> 47:15.749
between the thoracic
vertebrae six and seven

47:15.800 --> 47:18.552
so as to stop the brain
from learning of the pain.

47:18.586 --> 47:21.889
I intend to inject a 2% cocaine solution

47:21.923 --> 47:24.591
directly into Mr. Gentile's spinal canal.

47:24.593 --> 47:27.060
Low enough not to affect
the heart and lungs,

47:27.095 --> 47:30.764
high enough to dull everything below.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.268
My God, won't that paralyze him?

47:34.270 --> 47:37.571
Not if he makes for the hollow
canal in the sub-arachnoid space.

47:37.605 --> 47:41.775
It's been tried once before

47:41.777 --> 47:44.328
on a Labrador retriever.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.446
What happened?

47:46.448 --> 47:48.415
There isn't a day goes by

47:48.449 --> 47:50.167
where I don't miss that dog.

47:50.201 --> 47:54.087
(coughing)

47:54.122 --> 47:57.090
If you could attempt
to suppress your cough.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.293
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

48:05.099 --> 48:07.134
(groans)

48:36.714 --> 48:39.132
Just a few seconds more.

48:47.342 --> 48:49.509
Let's get him back down.

48:56.184 --> 48:57.851
He's a madman.

48:57.853 --> 48:59.820
"Though this is madness,

48:59.854 --> 49:02.105
yet there is method in it."

49:17.255 --> 49:19.506
No pain.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.708
Scalpel.

49:21.710 --> 49:24.211
(murmuring)

49:50.705 --> 49:52.572
Gauze.

49:52.623 --> 49:54.908
(sizzles)

50:07.638 --> 50:09.756
Towel.

50:27.108 --> 50:29.493
<i>Gallinger: Here's the
location of my repairs.</i>

50:29.527 --> 50:32.446
Your sutures failed in two spots

50:32.530 --> 50:34.915
where the obstruction backed
up with pressure on them.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.617
<i>- You should have resected.
- I know that now. I'm sorry.</i>

50:37.668 --> 50:40.003
Dr. Edwards, before you resign
and leave us all in tears,

50:40.038 --> 50:42.005
would you be kind enough
to go to the sterilizer

50:42.040 --> 50:44.925
and pass me the metal
device contained within?

50:44.959 --> 50:48.378
I'm now removing approximately 12 inches

50:48.429 --> 50:50.597
<i>of the patient's intestines</i>

50:50.631 --> 50:53.550
<i>to relieve a blockage and some damage.</i>

50:53.601 --> 50:57.137
<i>From this day forth, Mr. Gentile,</i>

50:57.139 --> 51:02.559
<i>you will have the honor
of evacuating your bowels</i>

51:02.610 --> 51:04.811
<i>several seconds faster</i>

51:04.862 --> 51:07.147
<i>than any of your friends.</i>

51:14.906 --> 51:16.623
Watch carefully, Bertie.

51:16.657 --> 51:19.376
You're gonna want to tell
your father all about this.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.495
(chuckles)

51:23.664 --> 51:26.383
After the bad section
of the bowel is removed,

51:26.417 --> 51:28.301
each new end of the intestine

51:28.336 --> 51:29.970
can be clamped together into this device

51:30.004 --> 51:34.724
which allows it to keep its
tubular contour and shape.

51:34.759 --> 51:36.843
I now tighten the screw

51:36.894 --> 51:39.563
to bring the two new ends together.

51:39.597 --> 51:42.899
And we're in good stead

51:42.934 --> 51:45.902
for an easy connection

51:45.937 --> 51:48.855
with sutures.

51:48.906 --> 51:51.525
When I finish this, you close, Everett.

51:54.412 --> 51:56.246
Nice knowing you, Doctor.

51:57.782 --> 52:00.500
I'm not leaving this circus

52:00.535 --> 52:03.703
until I learn everything
you have to teach.

52:05.289 --> 52:07.374
(sighs)

52:46.414 --> 52:47.998
Chinatown.

52:48.049 --> 52:50.667
- 467 Mott Street.
- Yes, sir.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.920
(kissing sounds)

52:53.922 --> 52:55.555
Yah.

53:03.133 --> 53:08.133
