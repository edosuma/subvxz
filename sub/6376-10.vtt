00:06.673 --> 00:10.632
Dr. Farkus. Dr. Farkus,

00:11.311 --> 00:13.176
can you please stop?

00:15.115 --> 00:18.812
Dr. Farkus, can you stop that, please?
Sorry, it's getting in my nose.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.209
Oh.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.478
I'm sorry.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.087
I... God, you look great.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.821
Oh, thanks.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.294
What's different about you?

00:29.863 --> 00:34.027
I don't know. Small changes.
No bangs, new glasses.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.464
Better to see me with.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.562
Yeah, are you still working
at the magazine?

00:38.605 --> 00:42.063
Yep, but I'm not an assistant anymore.
I'm an editor.

00:42.609 --> 00:44.804
Good for you. That's great.

00:44.844 --> 00:49.474
And in case you're wondering,
I am recently single.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.573
Oh.

00:50.617 --> 00:53.245
I wasn't wondering,
but I'm glad to know it.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.516
Well, I'm glad you're glad.

00:58.258 --> 01:02.490
Okay, since it's out there,
what about dinner tonight?

01:02.529 --> 01:07.466
I'm a professional. I don't get
grossed out by food caught in braces.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.994
That's very generous of you,
but I have a boyfriend.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.097
Oh.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.976
Well, I kind of wish
you had said that before.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.607
I feel like an idiot.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.138
No, come on, don't. I'm flattered.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.016
I hope so, because I'm doing great.

01:26.052 --> 01:27.519
Pulling in the high five figures.

01:27.554 --> 01:31.217
Well, mid-fives
with a little creative accounting, but...

01:32.292 --> 01:34.453
Can your new boyfriend
compete with that?

01:34.494 --> 01:37.725
He's pretty comfortable.
So, when are my braces coming off?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.028
Maybe when you lose the rich guy.

01:40.066 --> 01:44.435
I'm kidding. I don't know, soonish.
Is it serious between you two?

01:44.471 --> 01:48.464
Yeah, it's serious. "Soonish"?
What does that mean?

01:48.508 --> 01:52.376
You know, Betty,
I can't play this game anymore,

01:52.412 --> 01:55.870
so I'm gonna need you to find
a new orthodontist,

01:55.915 --> 01:59.908
or maybe your boyfriend
can pry them off with all of his money.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.107 --> 02:55.131
Ow!

03:02.682 --> 03:05.810
Oh, I forgot to tell you what happened
in the copy room today.

03:05.852 --> 03:10.585
The toner exploded all over Marc.
I know. I was there, remember?

03:10.623 --> 03:13.421
We're together all the time. Every day.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.393
It's great, isn't it?

03:16.095 --> 03:17.357
Yeah.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.462
- Night.
- Good night.

03:28.908 --> 03:33.277
Hey. Look who stayed here last night.
I haven't seen you in ages.

03:33.313 --> 03:36.282
Well, I thought it would be nice
for Matt and I to do our own thing

03:36.316 --> 03:37.613
for a change.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.309
These were just dropped off.

03:39.352 --> 03:40.717
Oh.

03:40.853 --> 03:42.445
Let's see who they're from.

03:42.755 --> 03:44.279
<i>Miss you much.</i>

03:44.424 --> 03:46.358
Oh! They're from Matt.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.486
- He's been laying it on thick lately.
- No, he hasn't.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.997
<i>- He's just been sweet, but...
- Miss you much. Miss you much.</i>

03:52.031 --> 03:53.259
<i>- Miss you much.
- Annoying.</i>

03:53.299 --> 03:57.030
I didn't say that. We've just been
spending a lot of time together.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.538
Watch out,
because I have seen this before.

03:59.572 --> 04:03.474
Couples start out all lovey-dovey,
attached at the hip,

04:03.509 --> 04:06.672
and then as time goes by,
they get totally sick of each other.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.273
Guys, Matt and I
are not sick of each other.

04:09.315 --> 04:15.151
<i>Miss you much. Miss you much.
Miss you much. Miss you...</i>

04:16.022 --> 04:17.512
I'm a little sick of that.

04:17.557 --> 04:20.617
Yeah, well, see?
It's the little things that'll get you.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.128
One day Matt is saying,
"Miss you much,"

04:23.162 --> 04:24.186
and the next day...

04:25.632 --> 04:27.065
Murder-suicide.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.158
I have to go.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.127
Hey, love you.

04:32.939 --> 04:37.842
So, Hilda, what's going on with your...
You know.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.909
You decided to have the baby.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.811
<i>You gotta tell papi and Justin
some time.</i>

04:41.848 --> 04:43.816
- And what about Bobby?
- I...

04:43.850 --> 04:45.112
He's the father.

04:45.151 --> 04:46.618
I don't even know if he should know.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.121
I'm just saying,
all those rumors in high school

04:49.155 --> 04:50.747
about his family being connected?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.451
It's one thing to date a bad boy,

04:52.492 --> 04:55.017
it is another thing
to raise a kid with one.

04:55.061 --> 05:00.556
That was a rumor 15 years ago.
Bobby is a sweet guy

05:00.600 --> 05:02.966
underneath all of that macho stuff.

05:03.002 --> 05:07.302
Maybe you should just spend a little bit
more time with him, get to know him.

05:10.943 --> 05:12.240
It's done.
Connor's agreed

05:12.278 --> 05:13.472
to give me the account numbers,

05:13.513 --> 05:14.605
and you'll have your money back.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.978
This is fantastic.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.246
<i>As soon as we buy Hartley out,
I can guarantee your return to Mode</i>

05:19.285 --> 05:22.311
as co-Editor-in-Chief
with 50% stake in the company.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.984
Not so fast.
There's still one remaining issue.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.459
I will not come back
to run the magazine with you

05:28.494 --> 05:31.429
as long as this woman
is creative director.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.858
Well, what can I do?
Denise has a four-year contract.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.493
How is that possible?

05:36.536 --> 05:39.027
This woman knows absolutely nothing
about fashion.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.096
Look what she's wearing.

05:40.139 --> 05:43.267
<i>Straight out of last month's
Lucky magazine, page 46.</i>

05:43.309 --> 05:47.609
She actually thinks Emporio Armani
and Giorgio Armani are brothers.

05:47.647 --> 05:48.671
Ha!

05:48.715 --> 05:49.739
Ha!

05:50.116 --> 05:52.277
Well, maybe that's why
she hasn't given an interview yet.

05:52.318 --> 05:55.446
She's afraid if she opens her mouth,
she'll make a complete fool of herself.

05:55.488 --> 06:00.516
If only we knew someone
who had connections to the media.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.585
Yeah, I know.

06:06.666 --> 06:08.429
Oh. Yeah, yeah, right.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.001
- I missed you last night.
- Mmm.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.706
I know, I got the flowers and the card.
That was very sweet. Thank you.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.945
Guess what? I scored us two tickets
to the Rangers game tonight.

06:24.984 --> 06:27.145
First 1,000 fans get
a commemorative puck.

06:27.186 --> 06:30.417
No, I can't.
I have that late photo shoot downtown.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.480
Oh.

06:31.691 --> 06:35.058
But go anyway. Go without me.
You can't miss Puck Night.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.584
It won't be much fun without you.

06:36.629 --> 06:40.588
Come on, someone around here
will want to go to a hockey game.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.000
Okay, maybe not. But go.
Bring me back a puck.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.675
Well, I guess I'll miss you much.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.936
Have fun.

06:59.552 --> 07:02.885
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm documenting your change.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.014
My what?

07:04.056 --> 07:06.183
Okay, you have been Daniel's assistant
for a week now,

07:06.225 --> 07:09.490
and I can already see it happening
right there.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.895
I missed one waxing appointment,
so what?

07:11.931 --> 07:12.955
So what?

07:12.999 --> 07:16.765
I have taken your picture
every single day this week. Look.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.471
I was trying something.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.903
- Oh, my God.
- Ahhh! Oh, my God.

07:21.941 --> 07:25.172
It's spooky. You're trans-Mexifying
right before our eyes.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.239
Thank you so much for the ride, Bobby.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.979
<i>It's Elizabeth Taylor week on Lifetime
and I could not miss BUtterfield 8.</i>

07:33.019 --> 07:36.921
She plays a prostitute
who has to pay for her sins. So, yeah.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.082
- Hi.
Hi.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.220
The kid was screaming at me to run
every red light. I almost clipped a nun.

07:42.261 --> 07:45.697
- Thank you for dropping him off.
- Yeah, no problem.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.929
- Hey.
- What's up?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.334
I know that we haven't had
a lot of chances to talk lately,

07:55.374 --> 07:57.638
so I was wondering

07:57.677 --> 08:01.238
if maybe you wanted to grab
a cup of coffee or something?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.907
- I knew it.
- You knew what?

08:02.949 --> 08:06.942
Justin told me you and Archie split.
It's because of me, right?

08:07.353 --> 08:08.479
- Wrong.
- Come on.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.079
I mean, I definitely had
something to do with it.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.182
No, you definitely had
nothing to do with it.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.593
You know, the more you tell me
that it didn't, the more I know it did.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.756
Oh, my God, I'm not gonna argue
with you about it, Bobby.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.390
Do you want to have coffee or not?

08:20.433 --> 08:23.766
Yeah, all right. Coffee sounds fun.
I'm always up for a little fun with you.

08:23.803 --> 08:27.261
No fun, just coffee.

08:27.306 --> 08:30.400
Okay. Okay.
Nobody's gonna have any fun.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.274
We'll just drink coffee.
We don't even have to talk.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.607
Good.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.774
So, is Denise still
in the concept meeting?

08:38.818 --> 08:41.116
It should be breaking up... Oh, my God.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.518
What?
He's back. Go.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.580
What is wrong?

08:44.624 --> 08:48.116
<i>My one-night stand from the Bahamas,
Troy. He works at Mode.</i>

08:48.160 --> 08:52.961
Wow, that must be awkward.
How long do we have to stay like this?

08:52.999 --> 08:54.091
Oh, sorry.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.593
I didn't think he'd be back so soon.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.232
His passport accidentally ended up
in my bag.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.765
Completely innocent,
fully-deniable mistake.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.709
But now it's like
he's some sort of stalker.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.178
I knew that was him at my gym

09:07.213 --> 09:08.771
and my bank
and my back-up gym and my...

09:08.814 --> 09:10.873
You know what? You're on your own.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.681
It's time to start
Operation Get-Rid-of-Denise.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.209
Denise, hey. Good news.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.018
<i>I got us an interview
on Fashion Buzz tomorrow.</i>

09:18.057 --> 09:20.651
- Really, tomorrow?
- It kind of has to be.

09:20.693 --> 09:22.991
<i>Do you know how hard it is
to get on Fashion Buzz?</i>

09:23.029 --> 09:25.190
Aren't you guys on that, like,
every day?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.699
Well, I know it seems that way.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.826
Well, I just wish
I had more time to prepare.

09:29.869 --> 09:34.306
Oh, come on, you're gonna do great.
Besides, Suzuki is no Diane Sawyer.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.136
Okay.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.248
It's sort of distracting,

09:51.290 --> 09:54.054
so if we could just do a couple frames
without it so we have some options...

09:54.093 --> 09:56.254
- Ahhh!
- Guess who.

09:57.229 --> 09:58.457
Matt?

09:58.764 --> 09:59.958
Surprise.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.933
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:01.968 --> 10:05.199
What happened to the Rangers game?
Commemorative Puck Night?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.865
I figured, "Puck it. "
We already spent one night apart.

10:07.907 --> 10:11.900
I couldn't stand being apart
one more minute. Missed you much.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.075
Okay.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.857
Ugh. You make me puke.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.758
"Miss you much. Miss you much. "

10:28.794 --> 10:30.091
How can you miss me much

10:30.129 --> 10:34.463
when we spend every day
and every night together?

10:34.500 --> 10:41.064
You've sucked the life out of me.
I had dreams before I met you.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.337
You want to know what my dream is?

10:43.376 --> 10:48.075
That you drop dead.
Maybe then I could miss you much.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.755
Missed you much, too.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.538
So your problem is your boyfriend
wants to spend time with you?

11:14.573 --> 11:19.533
Shh. No, my problem is he wants
to spend all of his time with me.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.540
I feel like we're gonna start
resenting each other.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.515
Doesn't he have anything else
going on?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.710
Well, he used to.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.720
I mean, he used to be passionate
about all sorts of things.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.689
Sports, painting,
and he was really good.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.624
I mean, look at this.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.021
- Matt did that?
- Yeah.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.996
- Wow, it's pretty good.
- I know.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.693
Hey, look at you in the window.
Why is your hand all blurry?

11:41.734 --> 11:44.225
- Because I'm waving.
- Cute.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.567
He loved painting.

11:45.604 --> 11:49.040
<i>But when he came to Mode,
he just let it go.</i>

11:49.075 --> 11:53.171
Well, maybe you can inspire him.
You know, get him back into it again.

11:53.212 --> 11:56.739
Mmm. That's a really good idea.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.114
You know what?
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.881
I'm gonna give him back his passion.

12:09.695 --> 12:10.923
Hi.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.191
Uh...

12:12.231 --> 12:14.791
We haven't had a chance to talk
since I got back.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.769
I know. We haven't.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.171
Okay, bye.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.369
Just promise me
you'll keep this Saturday night open.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.876
My parents are coming down
from Boston,

12:24.910 --> 12:26.844
and they are dying to meet
my first boyfriend.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.643
- Mercy.
- Actually, you're my first everything.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.150
Oh. Oh!

12:32.685 --> 12:36.086
I'm your first? Aren't you, like, 40?

12:38.591 --> 12:40.821
You were so worth the wait.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.062
Look, I know we were supposed to meet
at the coffee shop, all right?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.764
But I got you a little gift.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.680
What the hell?

13:02.548 --> 13:04.948
Look, I saw this and I thought of Justin.

13:04.984 --> 13:08.044
<i>He can watch BUtterfield 8 or whatever
on a big-screen TV. It's better.</i>

13:08.087 --> 13:09.611
This is too much.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.317
No, don't worry about it.
I got a good deal on it.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.417
A deal? What kind of a deal?

13:14.460 --> 13:17.293
Like a disappeared-from-a-
loading-dock kind of a deal?

13:17.329 --> 13:20.264
Whoa, hey.
What kind of thing is that to say?

13:20.299 --> 13:24.030
Most people, they would say,
"Hey, thank you. "

13:26.238 --> 13:28.365
So you gonna give me one?

13:29.508 --> 13:33.501
- Thank you.
- No, that sounded like it hurt.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.876
- Give me another one. Come on.
- Thank you.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.520
No, I don't buy it.
We're gonna have to work on that.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.549
So I would love to get
your perspective on this,

13:45.591 --> 13:48.754
<i>Denise Ludwig, new creative force
here at Mode.</i>

13:48.794 --> 13:51.194
Everybody's talking
about this "recession"

13:51.230 --> 13:53.926
and how no one can afford a manicure,

13:53.966 --> 13:58.528
so why do people keep spending $500
on the perfect pair of jeans?

14:00.039 --> 14:03.372
Suzuki, I love that question.
And no one can answer that better

14:03.409 --> 14:06.970
than my favorite designer,
Roberto DiPaolo himself.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.345
"Fashion is a dream
you put on in the morning. "

14:11.183 --> 14:13.310
Can't live without a dream, Suzuki.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.445
I think that says it all.

14:15.487 --> 14:19.150
I shall no longer worry
about the fate of this magazine.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.957
Cut. Mama needs some powder.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.768
Well, we didn't totally stink up the joint.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.000
I mean, you were amazing.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.771
I had no idea you knew so much
about fashion.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.403
Oh, I don't.

14:40.446 --> 14:44.746
I paid some freshman at FIT
like 40 bucks to pull some quotes.

14:44.783 --> 14:47.149
<i>Wow.
- I think he got that one from Lucky.</i>

14:47.186 --> 14:50.155
Honestly, I just...
I can't get my head around fashion.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.749
- You can't?
- No, it's just dumb.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.952
But you know what,
it doesn't even matter.

14:54.994 --> 14:59.863
I don't care if it's Donna Karan
or dog food, it's just something to sell.

14:59.899 --> 15:03.391
Now that Suzuki, is he gay?

15:03.435 --> 15:07.269
Because I thought I saw him
sneaking a peek at my snookie.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.151
Where does this go?
- Excuse me.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.677
In the next room
with the other paintings. Yes?

15:23.722 --> 15:26.714
I just read about your upcoming
Emerging Artists Showcase,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.556
and I was wondering
if you'd be interested

15:28.594 --> 15:30.619
in featuring an up-and-coming painter.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.188
- What have you done?
- Oh, me? No, nothing.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.724
I'm talking about my boyfriend.
He's a painter and he's very good.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.760
He painted this.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.335
Interesting. So this was painted
by your lover?

15:42.374 --> 15:43.841
My boyfriend.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.209
Boyfriend? Boring.

15:47.246 --> 15:50.579
Well, it's simple.
Nice use of perspective.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.511
- What's this smudge?
- Oh, that's me waving.

15:56.755 --> 16:01.590
I'm beginning to see the resemblance.
Oh, he's quite good, your lover.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.563
Yes, my boyfriend is great,
and this showcase is perfect for him.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.622
He's emerging, he's an artist,

16:07.666 --> 16:10.066
and it's exactly the lift
he could use right now.

16:10.102 --> 16:15.904
Well, unfortunately, I can't commit
to anything by just one painting.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.772
Oh, no. He has dozens more.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.779
They're in his storage unit.
I could take you there.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.145
All right. I'll have a look,

16:23.182 --> 16:27.209
but I'm warning you,
your lover better be good.

16:27.252 --> 16:29.345
Oh, my lover is good

16:30.422 --> 16:32.117
at painting.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.993
<i>And it's the same thing
with these overpriced rags, you know?</i>

16:41.033 --> 16:44.764
<i>I don't care if it's Donna Karan
or dog food, it's just something to sell.</i>

16:44.837 --> 16:47.772
In light of Denise Ludwig's
blasphemous interview,

16:47.806 --> 16:50.570
<i>I've been pumping my contacts
at Mode for info.</i>

16:50.609 --> 16:52.543
<i>Late word
into the Fashion Buzz newsroom</i>

16:52.578 --> 16:55.046
is Denise has resigned from her post

16:55.080 --> 16:59.983
and is returning to her Hollywood roots,
running a major TV studio.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.585
This is a category-five crap storm.

17:03.622 --> 17:05.817
Well, fortunately,
Wilhelmina is available

17:05.858 --> 17:08.291
to step right back into her old job.

17:08.327 --> 17:10.124
Over my dead body.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.494
I couldn't have described
your body better, Claire.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.501
What is she doing here?
We are not hiring her back.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.400
Actually, Cal, we don't need
your vote anymore.

17:18.436 --> 17:21.873
That's right. The stolen Meade money
has been recovered.

17:21.906 --> 17:22.964
It has?

17:23.008 --> 17:25.704
We can cut you a check
for your investment, plus interest,

17:25.743 --> 17:27.803
by the end of business today.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.782
Wait a minute, you two are partners
in this, aren't you?

17:32.418 --> 17:35.410
You set up that Denise video
and now you're trying to push Cal out.

17:35.454 --> 17:38.423
Look, I'm only gonna say this once,
so listen up.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.620
You don't tell me when to leave.
No one does.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.356
Well, I was hoping
you weren't gonna make this difficult.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.230
You don't know what difficult is,
but you might learn yet.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.836
- Mom.
- I don't want to hear it.

17:56.875 --> 18:01.812
You choose this woman over family?
I think that speaks volumes.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.717
I give you one simple task.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.814
Why am I so surprised
you fracked it up?

18:11.857 --> 18:14.052
You let me deal with my mother.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.551
We get her on our side,
she'll convince Cal to leave.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.058
Thanks again for coming to see
Matt's work.

18:23.102 --> 18:28.062
A show would be so amazing,
give him the focus he needs.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.244
- Frances?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

18:34.279 --> 18:38.716
My focus was drifting because
these paintings just aren't holding it.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.808
Really?

18:39.852 --> 18:43.788
Well, he's competent enough,
but they're so uninspired.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.255
He hasn't found his voice yet.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.852
Well, no, no. I mean, keep looking.
His voice has to be in here somewhere.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.223
That's Matt.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.201
I really want to keep this a surprise,
so can you just be quiet?

18:57.236 --> 18:59.101
I'll be right back.

19:00.906 --> 19:01.998
Hey.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.203
Hey. What are...
What are you doing here?

19:05.244 --> 19:08.270
I followed you.
What are you doing here?

19:08.313 --> 19:11.339
I forgot my cell. Wait, how could you
have followed me...

19:11.383 --> 19:14.819
- I missed you much. Let's go to lunch.
- Great.

19:15.621 --> 19:19.079
Get your cell phone.
What are you gonna do if I call you?

19:19.124 --> 19:20.523
Why would you have to call me if I...

19:20.559 --> 19:23.221
- Go, go.
- All right, okay. Okay.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.795
Did you find anything?

19:31.837 --> 19:35.238
Yes, the ones in the back are amazing.

19:35.274 --> 19:40.610
So full of passion and drama.
I think we have an emerging artist here.

19:40.646 --> 19:42.136
Great, awesome.
Take whatever you want.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.741
We can figure out the details later.
Thank you so much.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.978
Thank you for what?

19:47.019 --> 19:52.286
Thank you so much
for always being hungry when I am.

19:52.324 --> 19:55.259
We're so in tune. I'm starving, let's go.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.890
Oh, this is unacceptable, Marc.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.764
I can't wait for Dumb-Dumb
to make things happen for me.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.267
We have to put pressure on Claire.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.270
It's Dumb-Dumb. I mean Daniel.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.366
Probably misplaced
his beard comb again.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.901
Yes, I forgot
you're Daniel's bootlick now.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.005
Go ahead.
I'll figure out a way to do it myself.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.039
Yes, Claire Meade
was in South Dakota.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.483
I arranged for the travel myself.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.454
Victoria Hartley told you
about South Dakota.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.514
She told me her husband
got you pregnant.

20:37.169 --> 20:41.970
<i>Mi hija, this is amazing.
There is a picture in the picture.</i>

20:42.007 --> 20:44.805
- Where did this come from?
- Bobby stopped by earlier.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.904
Bobby Talercio gave us this TV?
Great, it's probably stolen.

20:48.947 --> 20:49.971
Did you get a receipt?

20:50.015 --> 20:54.179
- Why do we even have to go there?
- You know his family. They're corrupt.

20:54.219 --> 20:57.279
That is a vicious rumor.
Nobody was ever convicted.

20:57.322 --> 20:58.584
You know, Bobby told me over coffee...

20:58.624 --> 21:00.524
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You had coffee with him?

21:00.559 --> 21:02.117
Yeah, yesterday. It's no big deal.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.856
It is a big deal.
I don't want you hanging out with him.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.364
Well, you can't tell me
who I can and can't hang out with.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.597
- I'm not 17 years old, you know.
- Then stop acting like it.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.730
It's like you're making
the same mistakes all over again.

21:13.772 --> 21:14.898
<i>Papi, enough.</i>

21:14.940 --> 21:16.737
No, no, no.
First you break up with Archie

21:16.775 --> 21:19.505
and now you're hanging out
with Bobby.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.437
What's wrong with Bobby?

21:21.480 --> 21:25.143
He's a thug.
He always was and he always will be.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.689
Hello, dear.

22:19.037 --> 22:21.733
Let's have a little chat, shall we?

22:26.445 --> 22:28.743
What was Claire doing
in South Dakota?

22:28.780 --> 22:32.682
- Ow. You're hurting me.
- I'm not touching you.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.846
Oh. Well, how would I know
what she was doing in South Dakota?

22:35.887 --> 22:37.855
I don't even know where that country is.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.153
- Look at me.
- No.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.592
Marc told me
never to look you directly in the eye.

22:42.627 --> 22:47.087
- Amanda. It is Amanda, right?
- Yeah.

22:47.132 --> 22:51.728
Are you happy here
answering phones, getting coffee?

22:51.770 --> 22:53.795
Don't you want more out of life?

22:53.839 --> 22:57.138
Actually, I do wanna do more someday.
You know, like, in fashion.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.642
I could make that happen.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.872
- You could?
- Of course.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.437
I may not be in charge now,
but I will be again,

23:03.482 --> 23:06.315
and I could make
your dreams come true.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.081
Or I could keep you stuck
behind that reception desk

23:09.121 --> 23:10.679
until your skin turns the texture

23:10.722 --> 23:13.452
of a weathered Louis Vuitton
overnight bag.

23:13.492 --> 23:18.520
So tell me, what was Claire doing
in South Dakota?

23:25.003 --> 23:28.530
I won't tell you. I promised Mrs. Meade
I'd keep her secret.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.336
It's a pity,

23:30.375 --> 23:31.637
because you're the kind of woman

23:31.676 --> 23:35.407
that would appreciate
the value of accessorizing.

23:35.447 --> 23:38.109
It pulls the whole outfit together.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.119
Damn you.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.127
I am not having this conversation
with you again.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.531
Why are you still defending him?
This company is our legacy.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.057
You're letting him destroy it.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.227
I mean, all he cares about
is his bottom line.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.466
Just admit it, Daniel.
You don't like that Cal and I

24:01.506 --> 24:02.996
- are sleeping together.
- Oh, Mom.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.941
And you're letting your emotions
cloud your judgment.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.809
My judgment? You're the one
who's thinking with your...

24:07.846 --> 24:09.814
Not with your brain.

24:09.848 --> 24:13.249
Cal Hartley is a ruthless,
amoral monster.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.617
That is not true.

24:15.654 --> 24:19.317
I have known that man for 30 years.
He's a good man

24:19.357 --> 24:22.918
and he cares about this company
and he cares about me.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.994
After everything I've been through,

24:28.033 --> 24:32.629
I would have hoped that you would
allow me this little bit of happiness.

24:37.776 --> 24:40.176
Did you get this from Betty?

24:40.212 --> 24:44.842
"Surprise showing of new work
from emerging artist Matt Hartley. "

24:44.916 --> 24:48.113
My lunch is emerging
from my stomach.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.745
We're totally going, though, right?

24:49.788 --> 24:52.018
You going to Matt's opening?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.058
It could be our second date.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.628
I love you. Is it too early to say that?

25:02.667 --> 25:07.468
You know what? I don't care.
You're my boyfriend and I love you.

25:19.885 --> 25:21.375
Okay, what is up with that?

25:21.419 --> 25:23.148
If I'd known he was a guh-virgin,

25:23.188 --> 25:25.884
I never would have taken
his delicate flower.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.051
This is too much responsibility.
I have to dump him.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.219
No.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.786
He has imprinted on you
like a gay duckling.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.129
If you don't wean him off you slowly,
he'll die.

25:37.402 --> 25:40.132
You were right.
Best pot-stickers in New York.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.799
I know. I told you.

25:42.841 --> 25:47.039
Hey, look at this. "Emerging artists. "
Let's check it out.

25:47.078 --> 25:48.773
Emerging artists?

25:48.813 --> 25:51.338
Let's go back to my place.
Cheesy popcorn and a movie.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.580
- This will be better.
- Better than cheesy popcorn? I doubt it.

25:54.619 --> 25:56.086
It'll be close. Come on.

25:56.121 --> 25:58.885
All right, if it's what you want,
I'll do it for you.

25:58.924 --> 26:02.121
No, Matt, this is not about me.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.926
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

26:32.090 --> 26:35.856
- These are my paintings.
- These are your paintings?

26:35.894 --> 26:40.422
- What is this? What did you do?
- What did you do? Matt, these are...

26:40.465 --> 26:43.901
Marvelous. You must be the artist.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.061
You know, I think there's been...

26:45.103 --> 26:49.005
I've got to be honest with you,
when I first saw your work, meh.

26:49.040 --> 26:52.976
But then I saw these pieces.

26:53.011 --> 26:59.041
The texture, the depth,
the barely concealed hostility.

27:00.518 --> 27:02.918
You've got yourself
quite a little muse here.

27:02.954 --> 27:08.051
Come, people are dying to meet you.
And not just people. People.

27:14.432 --> 27:15.660
Betty.

27:20.438 --> 27:23.271
<i>Mi hija, I don't know what to say.</i>

27:23.308 --> 27:25.242
Hey, I do. The dude can paint.

27:25.276 --> 27:28.677
I did this so that Matt
would be passionate about his art,

27:28.713 --> 27:30.977
but all his art is about me.

27:31.016 --> 27:33.644
Well, that's not true.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.312
Okay, there is a theme.

27:35.353 --> 27:41.258
But, look, there's a nice landscape
over here with trees and snow,

27:41.292 --> 27:44.227
and, look, I don't see you here.

27:44.262 --> 27:45.991
Why do all the deers have braces?

27:46.031 --> 27:47.055
Ugh.

27:47.432 --> 27:49.832
I have to go find Matt.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.604
I'm gonna go have a pome-tini.

27:53.638 --> 27:56.072
Why don't you ask him
about the receipt?

27:57.475 --> 27:59.238
Receipt? What's he talking about?

27:59.277 --> 28:02.872
Oh, he worries,
you know, about the TV,

28:02.914 --> 28:06.611
like if it breaks or something,
we have to return it.

28:06.651 --> 28:08.778
There's a receipt, right?

28:09.320 --> 28:11.447
Don't worry about the receipt, okay?

28:11.489 --> 28:13.684
Anything goes wrong with the TV,
I'll get you another one.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.659
I'm gonna get a drink.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.657
I love it.
It reminds me

28:21.700 --> 28:24.601
of late-period Lucian Freud.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.934
Oh, French is so beautiful.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.063
That was English.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.130
<i>Oui.</i>

28:30.442 --> 28:33.741
Hey, Betty. Great show.

28:33.778 --> 28:36.144
- Hey, guys, have you seen Matt?
- The real Matt,

28:36.181 --> 28:37.512
or the Matt who's a human sacrifice

28:37.549 --> 28:39.847
and you're an Aztec warrior
cutting out his heart?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.249
Or the Matt who's an astronaut

28:41.286 --> 28:44.346
and you're an alien embryo
bursting out of his chest?

28:44.389 --> 28:46.880
Okay, I get it. What is that?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.417
Oh, this? I bought it.

28:50.261 --> 28:53.697
I don't know why,
but it just kind of spoke to me.

28:56.868 --> 28:58.267
Excuse me.

28:59.704 --> 29:02.935
Ugh. Troy, where are you?

29:02.974 --> 29:06.171
Did you follow the directions
I gave you? Uh-huh.

29:06.211 --> 29:11.205
Connecticut. Great.
Keep going, you're almost here.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.979
- Poor, poor little duckling.
- Shut up.

29:16.287 --> 29:20.621
We should be going.
We don't want to miss Matt's big night.

29:20.658 --> 29:23.092
You want to explain this to me?

29:27.866 --> 29:30.733
- Where did you get this?
- Doesn't matter.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.530
You told me you got rid of the baby.

29:33.571 --> 29:37.803
And I did,
just not the way we discussed.

29:37.842 --> 29:41.608
- You lied to me.
- I'm sorry. I should have told you.

29:41.646 --> 29:45.309
But everything's fine.
I went to South Dakota.

29:45.350 --> 29:48.114
- He's doing very well.
- What?

29:48.153 --> 29:51.486
You saw him?
Tell me he doesn't know I'm the father.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.924
No, he doesn't. What... Why...
Why would you ask me that?

29:54.959 --> 29:58.087
Oh, I don't know, maybe it's because
I spent my entire life

29:58.129 --> 30:00.427
building my business and my career,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.933
and now you tell me
there's some little bastard out there

30:02.967 --> 30:05.265
who could just waltz in here
and demand his cut.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.203
Cal, he's our son.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.172
I already have a son.

30:09.207 --> 30:14.440
This is a fire that I'm gonna have
to piss on before I get burned.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.676
I just... Claire, what were you thinking?

30:17.715 --> 30:20.377
That you would just go out
and find our long-lost little boy

30:20.418 --> 30:23.649
and we'd wind up happily ever after?
Is that it?

30:28.059 --> 30:30.926
You couldn't have
just had the abortion?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.200
Matt.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.270
Do you know how humiliated I am?

30:46.311 --> 30:48.211
These paintings
are my private thoughts.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.874
No one was supposed to see them.
They make me look crazy.

30:50.915 --> 30:54.214
Well, they make me
look like a monster.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.413
Is this really how you feel about me?

30:56.454 --> 30:59.252
I painted most of them when we were
broken up. There are good ones, too.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.917
Those aren't selling for quite as much.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.051
There's a bidding war on the one of me

31:02.093 --> 31:05.119
climbing the Empire State Building
holding you in my giant hairy hand.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.621
Look, it is just an outlet, Betty.
What, you've never felt angry with me?

31:08.666 --> 31:10.691
Never secretly thought
I was acting like a jerk?

31:10.735 --> 31:12.100
No.

31:12.737 --> 31:14.068
I mean, yes, of course.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.130
Everyone feels that,
but we don't hang it in a gallery.

31:16.174 --> 31:20.634
I didn't hang them in a gallery, you did.
Why did you do this?

31:20.678 --> 31:24.409
Because I wanted to surprise you.

31:24.449 --> 31:27.179
I wanted to help you feel passionate
about something.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.119
I feel passionate about us.

31:30.154 --> 31:34.352
No, Matt, about something
other than us.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.520
We spend every minute
of every day together.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.656
We wake up together,
we go to work together,

31:40.698 --> 31:43.360
we eat together,
we brush our teeth together.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.335
I'm sorry you feel smothered
by our relationship.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.235
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- And maybe the problem

31:47.272 --> 31:51.606
isn't that I have too much passion,
it's that you don't feel enough.

32:14.365 --> 32:17.994
Mom? I thought you and Cal
were going to Matt's show.

32:18.036 --> 32:21.563
- We had a change of plans.
- Okay.

32:23.041 --> 32:27.239
Look, I was thinking about
our conversation today about Cal.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.939
Let's not talk about Cal.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.346
Believe me, I'd rather not.

32:31.382 --> 32:37.617
Just wanted to say I'm sorry.
I did let it get personal.

32:38.056 --> 32:41.184
I meant what I said about Meade
being a family business,

32:41.492 --> 32:43.016
our family business.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.563
I won't let him come
between you and me.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.199
Thank you.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.742
Mmm. Thank you.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.875
Oh, my God, have you tried these
bacon-wrapped thingies? To die.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.145
<i>Hilda, you'd better slow down
if you don't want papi to figure out</i>

33:06.184 --> 33:09.779
- you're eating for two.
- Shut up. Oh, God.

33:11.222 --> 33:13.656
Are you okay? Did you see Matt?

33:13.691 --> 33:17.058
Well, I tried
but he just freaked out on me.

33:19.464 --> 33:21.489
He said I don't have enough passion.

33:21.532 --> 33:24.763
- That son of a bitch.
- That's a little strong.

33:25.603 --> 33:26.831
He is dead.

33:26.871 --> 33:30.204
Catch you next week, yeah.
- What the hell is your problem?

33:30.241 --> 33:31.731
What are you talking about?

33:31.776 --> 33:35.007
First you bring a hot TV to my house
and now you're bribing a cop?

33:35.046 --> 33:36.172
- What?
- Whoa, lady.

33:36.214 --> 33:37.476
Nobody's bribing nobody.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.380
Man, you almost had me.

33:39.417 --> 33:43.820
You almost had me convinced
that you were actually a decent guy.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.289
- This is Mikey, from the neighborhood.
- Hey.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.622
We played cards last night.
He took me to the cleaners.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.092
I'm just making good on it, that's it.

33:50.128 --> 33:52.289
How stupid do you think I am?

33:52.330 --> 33:55.697
<i>You know what, papi was right.
Once a thug, always a thug.</i>

33:55.733 --> 33:57.200
Hey. Hey.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.262
No.

34:00.905 --> 34:03.874
What's up with you, huh?
Why are you all up in my business?

34:03.908 --> 34:06.433
I don't know what your business is.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.967
I can never tell if you're telling me
the truth or pulling a fast one.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.277
So I keep you on your toes.
You used to like that.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.510
We're not kids anymore, Bobby.

34:13.551 --> 34:16.452
Fine. Look, what do you want from me?

34:16.487 --> 34:17.647
I don't know.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.885
Maybe I just want to believe
what you're telling me

34:20.925 --> 34:22.552
and not drive myself crazy

34:22.592 --> 34:25.960
thinking that every word
out of your mouth is a con job.

34:25.996 --> 34:29.056
It might make having
your baby a little easier.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.152
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.127
<i>- Did I hear papi leave?
- Yep.</i>

34:57.161 --> 34:59.186
Left early. Won't say a word to me.

34:59.230 --> 35:01.061
- What about Bobby?
- Nope.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.694
I haven't spoken to him since
he freaked out and took off yesterday.

35:04.735 --> 35:07.329
<i>Maybe papi's right.
Maybe he's not the right guy.</i>

35:07.371 --> 35:11.330
Or maybe it just wasn't the easiest way
for him to find out.

35:11.375 --> 35:15.311
Yeah, I guess. What about Matt?
You talk to him?

35:15.346 --> 35:18.873
No. I left him a message.
He didn't call back.

35:18.916 --> 35:20.679
I mean, even if he did,
I don't know what I'd say.

35:20.718 --> 35:22.515
He thinks I'm not passionate enough.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.487
Oh, bull.

35:24.522 --> 35:25.716
Remember when you were 12

35:25.756 --> 35:29.954
and you thought if you didn't marry
a Hanson brother, you were gonna die?

35:29.994 --> 35:33.293
And then in junior high when you found
out that Eddie Garcia was gay,

35:33.331 --> 35:34.798
and you wanted to kill yourself?

35:34.832 --> 35:38.666
Wait, I didn't tell you...
You read my diary?

35:38.703 --> 35:41.672
What? That stuff with Henry
was so hot.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.537
Hilda, how could you?

35:43.574 --> 35:47.010
What? I'm your sister.
I'm nosy, so sue me.

35:47.044 --> 35:50.172
The point is,
you've got plenty of passion.

35:50.214 --> 35:53.706
And at least you got a decent guy
to focus it on.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.115
Well, maybe you do, too.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.360
Can I come in? It's cold out here.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.872
- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:20.745 --> 36:26.115
Look, I'm sorry about last night.
It was just a bit of a shock.

36:26.150 --> 36:30.484
And I know I haven't given you
much reason to believe I'm a good guy,

36:31.756 --> 36:34.782
but I'm a good guy, you know?

36:35.893 --> 36:40.762
I want to be there for you. For our kid.
As much as you'll let me.

36:44.669 --> 36:48.161
A little peace offering.
Something for the baby.

36:49.907 --> 36:53.035
And the receipt's in the bag, okay?

36:56.314 --> 36:58.578
- Oh, Marc.
- Hide me. Make yourself huge.

36:58.616 --> 37:00.481
- I'm... Bloat. Bloat.
- No.

37:00.518 --> 37:03.612
Hi. Sorry I missed you last night.

37:03.654 --> 37:06.350
For some reason, I could not follow
those directions you gave me.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.359
I wound up
in a totally scary part of town.

37:09.393 --> 37:12.055
- I'm lucky I didn't get murdered.
- Lucky.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.927
Got you a present.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.264
- Underwear?
- Matching his and his.

37:20.304 --> 37:21.669
We have to talk.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.398
Baby duck.

37:28.479 --> 37:29.741
Listen.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.511
Before you say anything,
there's something I want to tell you.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.816
This is all new to me, Marc.
The boyfriend thing.

37:36.854 --> 37:42.087
And I can't believe
that I hit the jackpot on my first try.

37:42.126 --> 37:47.564
Look at you, you're an Adonis.
You're like a gay Hugh Jackman.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.761
I'm just really lucky.

37:55.339 --> 37:58.137
I'm sorry,
you wanted to say something?

37:59.176 --> 38:03.704
It's just... I'm going to go slip into these.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.080
Bye.

38:09.387 --> 38:12.322
Don't judge. He worships me.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.228
We need to talk.

38:24.268 --> 38:28.568
Now wait, before you say anything,
I owe you an apology.

38:28.606 --> 38:32.372
I'm sure you had your reasons
for making the decision you did.

38:32.410 --> 38:33.968
It's water under the bridge.

38:34.011 --> 38:37.469
Thank you, Cal. I appreciate that.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.107
And now I want you
to pack up your office

38:39.150 --> 38:42.017
and get the hell out of my building.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.147
- What?
- I'm backing Daniel and Wilhelmina.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.783
I want you to take their buyout offer.

38:47.825 --> 38:51.488
Claire, now you know
I'll do almost anything for you,

38:51.529 --> 38:55.192
but when it comes
to running my business,

38:55.232 --> 38:58.292
I don't like being told what to do

38:58.336 --> 38:59.894
by anyone.

39:01.906 --> 39:06.673
In that case, I'll be contacting Tyler.
That's our son's name,

39:09.347 --> 39:10.609
Tyler.

39:11.015 --> 39:15.281
And I'll be providing him proof
of who his biological father is,

39:15.319 --> 39:19.255
along with a breakdown of your
corporate holdings and your net worth.

39:19.290 --> 39:23.317
Oh, and maybe the name
of a paternity lawyer thrown in.

39:24.295 --> 39:26.058
Just for good measure.

39:26.097 --> 39:30.193
And now I want you out of this company

39:31.035 --> 39:34.198
and out of my life.

39:45.616 --> 39:47.584
- What's that?
- My diary.

39:47.618 --> 39:51.418
This entry is from the day that you
killed every single one of my pitches.

39:51.455 --> 39:53.923
I called you a cretin,
which I think shows a lot of emotion,

39:53.958 --> 39:56.119
because I don't think that's a word
people actually use anymore.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.388
- What are you doing?
- Two weeks ago

39:57.428 --> 40:01.694
when you took me to dinner at Craft,
I was so happy I wrote you a sonnet.

40:01.732 --> 40:05.065
- Why are you showing me this?
- Because.

40:06.971 --> 40:11.169
I may not put my emotions up on
a 10-by-10-foot canvas,

40:11.208 --> 40:13.972
but that doesn't mean they're not there.

40:14.011 --> 40:17.503
These pages are full
of all kinds of passion.

40:17.548 --> 40:20.312
You had a thing for the Hansons?

40:20.351 --> 40:24.811
Betty, I was a jerk yesterday.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have yelled at you.

40:24.855 --> 40:27.483
I shouldn't have shown your paintings.

40:28.058 --> 40:30.356
Betty, you were right.

40:30.394 --> 40:35.525
Look, you made me realize that I need
to find a better balance in my life.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.124
I love you and I want us to work,

40:37.168 --> 40:41.798
so I need to find something to pour
myself into to take the pressure off us.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.364
<i>And I don't think it's Mode.</i>

40:44.408 --> 40:47.036
- What do you mean?
- I'm quitting.

40:47.077 --> 40:48.374
Wow.

40:50.748 --> 40:53.774
- You sure about that?
- Absolutely.

40:53.818 --> 40:56.753
It's not my passion.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.687
You know, I need some time alone

40:58.722 --> 41:03.125
so that I can find something
that inspires me as much as you do.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.254
Well, I'm happy for you.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.723
But "alone"? Does that mean
we can't hang out tonight?

41:09.767 --> 41:13.396
Yeah, sorry, I've got some big plans.

41:13.437 --> 41:16.895
Dinner for one,
maybe a movie by myself.

41:16.941 --> 41:19.501
- Some drinking alone.
- Sounds nice.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.808
Sounds awful.
Do you want to come over?

41:22.847 --> 41:25.543
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

41:28.185 --> 41:30.016
Down the hallway to the left.

41:30.054 --> 41:32.249
Not wasting any time, I see.

41:32.289 --> 41:36.157
There are trends to be set,
dreams to be trampled.

41:36.193 --> 41:38.559
Kudos on outmaneuvering Hartley.

41:38.596 --> 41:41.895
You must have found one mighty
big stick to beat that horse with.

41:41.932 --> 41:43.866
I know you had something
to do with this.

41:43.901 --> 41:46.199
Claire, whatever are you talking about?

41:46.237 --> 41:49.536
Confidential files don't
just land on people's desks

41:49.573 --> 41:51.268
around here by accident.

41:55.212 --> 42:01.310
I don't want Daniel to know about
South Dakota. Is that understood?

42:01.852 --> 42:04.252
Claire, darling, how can I tell
Daniel something

42:04.288 --> 42:07.155
I know absolutely nothing about?

42:12.997 --> 42:15.090
Move it. Out of my way.

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
