00:01.820 --> 00:04.516
Previously onSEAL Team...Jason still being stubborn?

00:04.560 --> 00:07.609
Here I am.You hear what's going on
over at Charlie Team?

00:07.650 --> 00:08.821
RAY:
You ever hear the saying,

00:08.870 --> 00:10.269
"quit while you're ahead,"
Jason?

00:10.310 --> 00:12.084
Quit? That's real funny
coming from a guy like you,

00:12.140 --> 00:13.391
'cause what I'm hearing is that

00:13.440 --> 00:14.702
you're window-shopping
other teams.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.967
ALANA:
What's wrong?

00:16.010 --> 00:17.227
I could use a beer.

00:17.270 --> 00:18.316
Look, I'm gonna go grab

00:18.360 --> 00:20.965
H-E-B's finest bottle
of $12 red,

00:21.020 --> 00:22.271
rotisserie chicken

00:22.320 --> 00:23.799
and beer.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.398
POLICEMAN:
Are you Jason Hayes?

00:25.460 --> 00:26.279
What can I help you with?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.319
It's your wife.

00:27.370 --> 00:28.587
There's been an accident.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.710
She's being'transported

00:29.760 --> 00:31.546
to the Ramston
Medical Center.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.365
We're clear.

01:31.390 --> 01:34.177
Captain, this is Bravo 1.
Entered main lobby.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.977
BROCK:
Cerberus...

02:42.980 --> 02:44.857
SONNY:
Let's get ready to rumble.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.959
[woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.]

03:01.740 --> 03:04.391
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
There's been an accident.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.566
My wife. Hayes.Name?

03:05.620 --> 03:07.565
H-A-Y-E-S. Alana Hayes.

03:11.230 --> 03:12.834
She's in surgery.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.404
It's down the hallway
to the right.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.214
I'm sorry.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.786
SONNY:
Listen here, Tinker Bell, okay?

03:48.830 --> 03:51.788
There is no way in hell
that people of your ilk

03:51.840 --> 03:53.649
are better _
at throwrng sharp objects

03:53.710 --> 03:55.314
than my people, okay?Ooh, nice.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.225
Oh, there you go. No look, too.That was nice. That was nice.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.272
Here you go. So close.I'd probably look next time.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.369
Listen here,
sunshine, all right?

04:03.410 --> 04:05.935
My people, the Vikings,
we throw rocks, okay?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.459
All right, we don't need
the sharp objects.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.979
That's for the old ladies
and the children.

04:09.030 --> 04:12.158
You see, I am
a "Raspatutin" in boots.

04:13.900 --> 04:17.119
A Rasputin with a love
of rodeo. Mm-hmm.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.549
I'm in your head
right now, aren't I?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.726
Oh!

04:20.780 --> 04:23.123
Boom!

04:23.170 --> 04:25.513
That was a good shot there,
CoverGirl. Not gonna lie.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.562
I'd like to drink a little.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.138
VVho?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.999
It's Jason.

04:44.370 --> 04:45.883
Alana, actually.

04:52.810 --> 04:56.769
Oh. Oh, no.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.901
You wanted to see me, sir?

05:05.170 --> 05:07.161
Davis.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.430
There's been an accident.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.566
Alana Hayes.

05:13.610 --> 05:16.340
She was killed earlier.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.879
: I don't
have all the details.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.399
May have been
a drunk driver.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.704
I know everyone
is gonna take this hard,

05:21.750 --> 05:23.615
so I'll keep you posted

05:23.670 --> 05:25.353
when more information comes,
all right?

05:27.100 --> 05:29.102
Hello?

05:54.170 --> 05:56.730
Alana, she...

05:56.790 --> 05:58.781
she's...

06:01.880 --> 06:03.177
I can't, Ray.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.186
She's...I know.

06:10.710 --> 06:12.712
She...

06:28.120 --> 06:30.588
MAN : Keep a close
watch over your bags

06:30.650 --> 06:32.595
and personal items...

06:32.650 --> 06:33.901
Mrs. Hayes.

06:33.950 --> 06:35.952
You must be my ride.Yes. Petty Ofﬁcer Davis.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.433
It's a pleasure to meet you,

06:37.480 --> 06:39.300
although I wish it were
under better circumstances.

06:39.350 --> 06:41.739
I'm a civilian,
Petty Officer Davis.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.304
Do you mind ifI call you
by your first name?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.396
Not at all. It's Lisa.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.658
And my name is Linda, not ma'am.

06:48.710 --> 06:49.927
Yes, ma'am.

06:49.970 --> 06:51.790
Lisa...

06:51.840 --> 06:53.751
how's
m
y son?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.973
He's not great.

06:56.020 --> 06:59.888
But we've got him. All of us.

06:59.940 --> 07:02.898
We're here for him.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.067
Dawn? Hi. Uh, my name is Stella.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.724
I'm Clay's girlfriend.

07:06.770 --> 07:10.888
Naima asked me to call
for Jason and his family.

07:10.950 --> 07:13.942
Well, actually,
they'll need, uh, meals

07:13.990 --> 07:15.810
and groceries. If...

07:15.870 --> 07:17.940
Oh, if you could,
that would be great.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.901
Yeah, I'm actually
gonna send a schedule out,

07:20.960 --> 07:23.087
if that's all right.

07:23.130 --> 07:25.519
Oh, okay, good. Thank you.
Thank you, Dawn.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.913
All right. Okay, bye.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.008
Only 14 more to go.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.871
Hey.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.229
I'm sorry you
had to do this.

07:36.280 --> 07:38.623
Ijust... I didn't
want to say no.

07:38.670 --> 07:41.798
It's okay.
It's just a little weird.

07:41.850 --> 07:43.715
"Hi. I'm Stella.
We've never actually met,

07:43.760 --> 07:46.843
but, um, Alana died.
Can you bring a casserole?"

07:46.900 --> 07:48.982
Just make sure someone brings
that one with the green beans

07:49.030 --> 07:51.931
and the little onions,
Campbell's soup.

07:51.990 --> 07:53.764
Okay.

07:53.820 --> 07:56.778
And, uh, and beer.
Lots of beer.

07:56.820 --> 07:59.812
Okay, so the exact casserole
everyone's grandma made.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.815
And beer.But none... Hey,
none of that...

08:01.870 --> 08:04.338
none of that fancy
microbrew crap, okay?

08:04.390 --> 08:07.439
None of the fancy
microbrew crap. Got it.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.924
How do you...
how do you do this?

08:15.970 --> 08:19.531
Hmm?Just how do you...

08:19.580 --> 08:22.014
deal with death all the time?

08:22.060 --> 08:24.369
I mean, I get that Team guys
are supposed to run

08:24.410 --> 08:27.368
towards the bullets
and all that, but still.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.458
Yeah, I've never
dealt with this

08:29.500 --> 08:32.765
when it had to do
with someone's wife.

08:32.810 --> 08:34.766
We don't do this.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.943
I can't even imagine.

08:42.430 --> 08:45.069
Sonny, it's Naima.
Open the door.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.860
Open the door, Sonny,
or I'm coming in.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.781
Damn, Naima.Don't start, Sonny.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.967
I-I know you're hurting.
We all are.

09:00.010 --> 09:01.796
And we're all gonna
have to deal with it.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.445
Right now is about Jason.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.446
Get in the shower
and get It together.

09:11.890 --> 09:14.541
Yes, ma'am.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.289
I'll fix you
something to eat

09:17.330 --> 09:20.072
to soak up all
that booze.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.949
Do you want something to eat?

10:13.000 --> 10:15.218
Emma.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.046
I don't want to eat.

10:18.570 --> 10:21.038
I want to find a bat

10:21.090 --> 10:22.876
and break every window
in the house.

10:22.920 --> 10:26.572
: I want_ to break
everything I see.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.133
So do I.

10:30.970 --> 10:32.619
I know.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.272
It's hard.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.582
I miss her.Shh. Yeah, I know.

10:39.630 --> 10:42.588
Hey. So do I.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.152
It's all right.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.564
Did you hear
from Mandy yet?

11:05.620 --> 11:07.872
She's trying to catch a flight.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.480
I'd like you to meet
Alana's parents.

11:10.530 --> 11:13.613
Grace, Robert,

11:13.670 --> 11:16.400
this is Victoria,
Adam's wife.

11:16.450 --> 11:18.099
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

11:18.150 --> 11:19.629
Thank you.

11:19.670 --> 11:21.581
We're glad you could come.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.541
Alana was like family.

11:23.590 --> 11:25.842
Uh, my husband Adam
went through BUD/S with Jason.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.539
Our girls grew up together.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.510
I want out of here.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.425
Let's steal some beer,
leave.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.461
No, I think we should
stay here.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.602
Here sucks so hard.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.730
You want to tell me what you're
doing out here,

11:46.790 --> 11:49.566
when I know you changed
that oil pan already?

11:49.620 --> 11:51.872
Thought I saw a leak, you know.
It was worth a look.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.319
Uh-huh.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.965
You do realize everyone
is inside, correct?

11:56.010 --> 11:59.138
Yeah, yeah. I can...
I can hear 'em.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.272
I got ears.
I can hear 'em.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.629
I don't want to hear 'em.

12:03.670 --> 12:05.718
I don't care about what
they have to say.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.409
All the "I'm sorrys," you know,

12:07.460 --> 12:08.802
"How are you, Jason?"
"How's it going?"

12:08.850 --> 12:10.408
"Can I get you something?"
"Everything okay?"

12:10.460 --> 12:12.416
Okay.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.461
You want them to leave?

12:18.040 --> 12:20.907
No.

12:20.950 --> 12:24.556
They just are here to help,
that's all. I don't...

12:28.660 --> 12:33.438
I handled all this wrong, Ray,
you know?

12:33.490 --> 12:35.355
Your shoulder, Green Team,

12:35.400 --> 12:37.095
Ijust...
I handled it all wrong.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.578
Maybe you didn't.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.234
Maybe you were right.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.759
Someone did die.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.665
Yeah.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.449
Someone died.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.582
It's war.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.939
Maybe I took it
personally, I don't know.

12:54.990 --> 12:57.242
You know, the thing is, Ray,

12:57.290 --> 13:00.817
you know, I count on you more
than anyone on this team.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.128
But Alana dying,
I just...

13:05.170 --> 13:07.035
I don't...

13:08.480 --> 13:10.471
Hey.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.659
It's done.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.656
It's in the past.

13:14.700 --> 13:17.043
Ray...

13:18.970 --> 13:20.619
I can't bury her.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.928
You know, when something
like this happens to us,

13:24.970 --> 13:28.053
you know, the Naw,
they just take care of it.

13:28.110 --> 13:29.839
Can't do it.

13:29.890 --> 13:32.233
It's fine, brother. Hey.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.281
The team can take over.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.849
We got this, Jason.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.769
Thank God for the deli.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.163
Storm J-bad, no problem.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.768
Put me in the kitchen,
and I'm useless.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.082
You catch the news?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.166
See what's going on
in Mumbai?

13:52.220 --> 13:54.643
Yeah. Looks like
it's escalating.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.736
CLAY:
Yeah, we're probably
gonna get spun up soon.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.041
ERIC:
'Fraid so.

13:58.090 --> 14:00.308
We need someone to help
with cleaning the house

14:00.360 --> 14:01.839
and the kids' laundry.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.006
I can do that.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.449
Thanks.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.882
Whoa, Stella, let me move
some of that for you.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.704
STELLA: Thank you.
It's a little hot.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.842
You know, any woman
that can teach literature,

14:11.890 --> 14:13.881
put up with you and sling
casseroles at a funeral...

14:13.940 --> 14:16.408
My, I think we have enough food
to feed the entire Naw

14:16.460 --> 14:17.757
and we'd still have leftovers.

14:17.810 --> 14:19.505
NAIMA: It's the
SEAL community.

14:19.550 --> 14:20.858
Take care of our own.

14:21.900 --> 14:22.935
Keepen

14:22.990 --> 14:25.766
That's what I was thinking.Mm-hmm.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.812
SONNY:
Hang tough there, Mikey.

14:30.820 --> 14:33.994
You know, there ain't no
real way through it.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.770
You just got to look
right at it.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.958
Your mama would be
real proud of you.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.740
You know, ever, uh,
since I joined Bravo Team,

14:43.790 --> 14:45.838
I've wanted to be just like
your daddy.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.654
I did.

14:47.710 --> 14:51.749
He's one tough
Tier 1 badass.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.836
Best I've ever seen.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.673
Hey, Mikey. Look at me.

15:00.370 --> 15:03.373
I promise you I won't let
anything happen to him.

15:04.810 --> 15:07.278
Okay?

15:11.170 --> 15:12.899
Do you think this feels
different for Dad?

15:15.780 --> 15:17.953
Different from all the people
he's buried?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.479
Other soldiers?

15:19.520 --> 15:21.340
Other Team guys.

15:21.390 --> 15:25.269
I mean, Dad's known a lot
of people who've died.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.354
: So maybe this isn't
as hard for him.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.790
Your parents may
have had problems,

15:37.840 --> 15:40.229
but he loved your mom very much.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.100
Okay.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.540
This is more than hard
for your dad, honey.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.672
I think this is going to be

15:47.720 --> 15:52.373
the hardest thing for him...
ever.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.697
Go on.

16:14.490 --> 16:15.969
Okay, Emma.

16:39.520 --> 16:43.206
I'm gonna call the florist
before they close.

16:43.260 --> 16:46.866
We should really go there
first thing in the morning.

16:46.910 --> 16:49.959
If you're okay with that.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.479
What are you doing?

16:51.530 --> 16:53.828
Davis said that any girl
who can put up with me

16:53.880 --> 16:57.577
and sling casseroles at
a wake... is a keeper.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.798
Okay. Then keep me.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.091
Okay.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.796
I will say, though,
that H never pictured myself

17:06.850 --> 17:09.887
a part of the Pink Squadron,
you know?

17:09.940 --> 17:12.022
But there I was
on kitchen duty.

17:12.070 --> 17:15.028
Casserole in one hand
and fruit salad in the other.

17:15.070 --> 17:18.631
Not really the, uh...
the look of a true feminist?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.296
Maybe.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.649
Actually, I don't know.

17:23.690 --> 17:25.294
All I know is that
I'm really glad

17:25.340 --> 17:27.296
I got to be
a part of today.

17:27.350 --> 17:29.818
You know, everybody dropping
everything, no questions asked.

17:29.870 --> 17:31.178
It's not usual.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.949
It's just the right thing to do.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.956
Mm, my world...

17:35.010 --> 17:37.353
Mm, I don't know, the people
wouldn't know how to do today.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.049
They might surprise you.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.351
Maybe.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.129
People that you
work with,

17:42.190 --> 17:43.919
military in general,

17:43.970 --> 17:46.837
it's different.

17:46.890 --> 17:51.452
It's like... like a community,
you know, like... like family.

17:54.110 --> 17:56.897
Talk about embracing the suck.

17:56.940 --> 18:00.899
You know, I... I ain't never
picked out a coffin before.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.464
It's called a casket.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.853
Coffin is... morbid.

18:04.900 --> 18:07.721
No. Coffin, casket,

18:07.780 --> 18:10.647
pine ride to the
nether world...

18:10.690 --> 18:12.032
That's all you, Davis.

18:12.090 --> 18:15.127
Uh, no. No.

18:15.180 --> 18:19.651
Look, the only funerals that
I've ever been to were Naw.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.964
Dress blues
and 21 guns.
Yeah.

18:22.010 --> 18:25.093
All I had to do was stand
at attention.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.927
Well, a Navy funeral,
that sounds morbid to me.

18:27.970 --> 18:30.143
And there's no way in hell
I'm letting a bunch

18:30.190 --> 18:32.658
of squids handle
my final good-bye.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.679
You see, I want, like,
a Texas

18:36.720 --> 18:39.029
Grill me right alongside
the ribs,

18:39.070 --> 18:42.676
and then take my ashes and
scatter them all over the Alamo.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.721
There's something wrong
with you, you know that?

18:44.770 --> 18:45.987
I stand by my choice.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.156
Okay.How about you?

18:47.210 --> 18:49.940
Hmm? Let me guess,
you want, like, some sort

18:49.990 --> 18:51.514
of traditional funeral?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.073
I don't care.
Yeah?

18:53.130 --> 18:56.566
Ijust... I want my life
to have mattered.

18:56.610 --> 18:58.999
Well, that's a done deal, Davis.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.563
It already does.

19:00.610 --> 19:05.138
To all the people here,
to the team. To me.

19:06.530 --> 19:07.838
Thank you, Sonny.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.132
That's... nice to hear.

19:11.410 --> 19:12.661
Oh, pump the brakes.

19:12.710 --> 19:14.052
Don't get too touched.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.408
I've had...

19:15.450 --> 19:17.623
too many feels
already today.
Okay.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.012
Okay?

19:19.070 --> 19:22.062
I need another drink.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.073
How's it going?

19:34.120 --> 19:36.680
Oh, good, sir, uh,
all things considered.

19:36.740 --> 19:37.775
Yeah.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.082
Hey, can we get you something?

19:39.130 --> 19:40.119
Sonny's up at the bar.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.866
No, thanks. I'm good.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.047
Listen, I didn't want
to tell you at the house,

19:45.090 --> 19:48.969
but, um, you got
your commission, Lisa.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.649
You are going to
Officer Candidate School.

19:51.710 --> 19:53.268
I did it

19:53.320 --> 19:56.756
Less than one percent of
enlisted achieve a commission.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.236
You should be proud.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.236
Oh, God.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.884
You all right?
Yeah.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.749
Yeah, yeah.

20:05.810 --> 20:07.539
Th-That is great news,
thank you.

20:07.590 --> 20:08.761
Um...

20:08.810 --> 20:10.505
Hey, do you th...

20:10.550 --> 20:13.155
Do you think we could just keep
this between us for right now?

20:13.210 --> 20:16.680
Sure. No problem.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.252
If you insist.
Mm.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.551
Officer.

20:28.090 --> 20:29.478
I hate leftovers.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.784
How about I make us
some soup, hmm?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.180
I'll order pizza.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.265
We had that last night.

20:38.620 --> 20:39.928
LINDA:
All right, well,

20:39.970 --> 20:41.699
what do you feel like, hmm?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.102
EMMA:
Tacos.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.708
Ketchup tacos.

20:44.760 --> 20:45.795
EMMA:
Great idea.

20:45.850 --> 20:47.238
Ketchup tacos?

20:47.280 --> 20:49.282
EMMA:
They're better
than they sound.

20:49.330 --> 20:53.152
Mom, it's just tacos with
ketchup in the mix, that's all.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.156
But not too much ketchup.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.940
And Worcestershire.Should be, um...

20:57.990 --> 21:00.208
Mom's recipe's got to be
around here somewhere, right?

21:00.250 --> 21:03.071
Mom always made them
from memory.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.691
Okay.

21:08.740 --> 21:09.911
Mikey, get the spatula.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.268
Clear some of this stuff off.

21:11.310 --> 21:12.823
Mom's not here,

21:12.880 --> 21:14.211
so Mom can't make it
from memory.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.044
Right?

21:17.530 --> 21:19.839
LINDA:
Geez. Here...

21:19.880 --> 21:22.053
Honey, I got it.Okay, Mom, stop! Stop!

21:22.100 --> 21:23.886
I got it.

21:23.930 --> 21:25.886
I got it.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.409
Don't!
Jason!

21:34.460 --> 21:35.415
Damn it! Damn it!

21:35.460 --> 21:36.449
Jason!

21:36.510 --> 21:39.206
Come on! Damn it!Daddy!

21:39.250 --> 21:41.024
Dad.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.297
Dad.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.171
It's going to be all right.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.913
I promise.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.241
Came as soon as I heard.

22:22.290 --> 22:24.338
No more sympathy,
all right?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.369
None.

22:27.430 --> 22:31.207
No more "How are you holding up,
Jason?" questions.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.034
I don't want to talk about me,

22:33.090 --> 22:34.773
and I don't want to talk
about Alana.

23:26.180 --> 23:29.968
Pretty sure the next Sprinter
to Norfolk isn't till tomorrow.

23:30.010 --> 23:32.706
It's kind of creepy
how you find me.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.274
You're Bravo 1.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.185
Got to always keep you
in my sights, right?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.236
Funeral home sent me this.
It's a...

23:43.420 --> 23:45.581
It's got Alana's
jewelry inside.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.065
This is where it happened.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.111
This is where her car was hit.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.469
Corner of Holland
and Dam Neck.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.590
I know.

23:56.650 --> 23:59.642
I was counting the cars, Ray.

23:59.690 --> 24:02.432
1,142 in two hours.

24:04.050 --> 24:05.608
Imagine that many
in an hour,

24:05.660 --> 24:07.560
in a clay, in a
week, in a year?

24:07.620 --> 24:09.611
No one's ever died here
until Alana.

24:12.530 --> 24:14.486
Makes no sense.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.311
Know what makes
even less sense?

24:18.360 --> 24:21.102
When I was away operating,
my wife was at home

24:21.150 --> 24:24.495
worrying about me
being killed.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.677
I've trucked through some
of the most dangerous places

24:26.720 --> 24:28.233
in the world. I mean...

24:28.290 --> 24:30.588
I've been shot,
I've been stabbed.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.894
Survived a helicopter crash.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.815
And I'm alive.

24:35.860 --> 24:39.682
I'm alive... sitting here
where she died.

24:42.260 --> 24:44.034
Just a mile
from our house.

24:44.090 --> 24:46.433
You're gonna get
through this, Jason.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.254
It's gonna take time, brother,

24:48.310 --> 24:50.210
but you're gonna get
through it, I promise.

24:50.270 --> 24:52.738
I took her for granted, Ray.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.304
I took her
for granted.

25:01.890 --> 25:03.881
I miss her, Ray.

25:13.030 --> 25:16.284
Mikey?

25:16.340 --> 25:18.683
Mikey, what are you doing?

25:20.250 --> 25:22.206
Right, okay.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.560
You don't want to talk to me,
I get it.

25:26.610 --> 25:28.475
You have every right
to be mad at me.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.953
You know, I deserve it.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.343
I'm sorry.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.174
I'm really sorry, Mikey.

25:34.220 --> 25:37.178
You shouldn't have hit
the refrigerator.

25:37.230 --> 25:39.095
Mom wouldn't have liked it.

25:39.140 --> 25:40.789
You're right.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.353
Mom definitely
wouldn't have liked me

25:42.410 --> 25:43.661
hitting that refrigerator.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.439
That was
her favorite refrigerator.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.583
We shouldn't forget...

25:48.630 --> 25:50.450
just because she's gone.

25:50.500 --> 25:53.628
No way.
We're never gonna forget.

25:53.680 --> 25:56.410
Look at me. Hey.

25:56.460 --> 25:59.156
I promise you

25:59.200 --> 26:00.599
we're never gonna forget her.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.948
You understand?

26:14.180 --> 26:17.001
We're picking out a
dress for Alana to wear.

26:43.250 --> 26:46.378
[Jason inhales deeply,
clears throat]

26:59.440 --> 27:01.214
This one.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.784
This is the one.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.355
Yeah, she wore this
all the time.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.391
Because you bought it for her.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.416
She, um...

27:19.460 --> 27:21.849
She wore this
to your Christmas recital.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.680
She sent me a picture of the...

27:26.730 --> 27:29.244
the three of you,
and she was wearing this dress.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.206
MAN:
You prepare

27:33.260 --> 27:36.206
a table before me in the
presence of my enemies.

27:36.260 --> 27:38.990
You anoint my
head with oil.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.042
My cup runneth over.

27:41.090 --> 27:44.048
Surely, goodness and
mercy shall follow me

27:44.090 --> 27:46.308
all the days of my life;

27:46.360 --> 27:51.388
and I shall dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

27:51.450 --> 27:53.406
Amen.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.580
I'm not really good at this.
I...

28:10.160 --> 28:12.333
...wrote some things down.

28:17.650 --> 28:20.551
It's, uh, ironic
that I'm a SEAL

28:20.610 --> 28:22.692
and, uh, Alana-- she's the one

28:22.740 --> 28:25.174
who pulled me out of the water
when we were kids

28:25.220 --> 28:28.303
and saved me.

28:28.350 --> 28:30.352
That's how we met.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.005
It's always been Alana and me...

28:37.060 --> 28:39.096
and then the kids.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.361
A family.

28:43.800 --> 28:47.418
Ithought
that Alana revolved around me.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.839
Like she and the kids
were frozen in time

28:50.900 --> 28:53.061
right when I left
until I came home.

28:55.030 --> 28:57.078
But now I understand.

28:58.990 --> 29:01.129
I understand.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.553
It was because of Alana

29:05.610 --> 29:08.044
that I could be who I was--

29:08.090 --> 29:09.739
a Team guy.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.835
She held everything
together and made it work.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.441
She didn't revolve around me.

29:22.450 --> 29:24.498
I revolved around her.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.360
Our family did.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.239
I really hope

29:32.290 --> 29:35.509
that our family can survive
without you, baby.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.181
I hate you!

30:07.240 --> 30:09.367
I hate you!
I hate you!
All right.

30:09.410 --> 30:11.014
Hey. Hey.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.583
Stop. Hey. Stop.I hate you. I hate you.

30:15.630 --> 30:18.417
JASON:
Stop. Stop.

30:27.430 --> 30:29.603
You can't go.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.437
You can't go.

30:34.780 --> 30:36.520
You can't go.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.444
I'm sorry. I know the timing
couldn't be worse,

30:43.490 --> 30:46.391
but _we have
a Situation.

30:46.450 --> 30:48.884
Pakistani radicals,
Hizbul Mujahideen,

30:48.930 --> 30:50.795
have taken over
a hotel in Mumbai.

30:50.840 --> 30:52.888
MANDY:
_ Their actions are
In response to Indian

30:52.930 --> 30:55.490
troop movement in
the Kashmir region.

30:55.540 --> 30:57.804
HM wants to draw attention
to their cause.

30:57.850 --> 31:00.637
They've seized
the Grand Sopara Hotel

31:00.680 --> 31:02.807
in downtown Mumbai, where an
American Foreign Service Officer

31:02.860 --> 31:05.727
is staying.
CLAY:
We're operating in

31:05.770 --> 31:07.988
a friendly country?ERIC: Indian government has
given us the green light

31:08.040 --> 31:10.850
to go in and rescue our FSO.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.162
But bear in mind, that is
the extent of our mission.

31:13.210 --> 31:15.644
We go in, we grab
our guy, we exfil.

31:15.690 --> 31:17.214
End of story.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.958
MANDY:
FSO David Nelson

31:27.010 --> 31:29.615
left the embassy at
1500 hours local time

31:29.670 --> 31:31.535
and returned to his hotel.

31:31.580 --> 31:34.140
According to his wife,
he called her

31:34.190 --> 31:35.976
about an hour
before the assault.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.102
We believe
he's still in his room.

31:38.150 --> 31:41.677
Based on visuals procured
from multiple sources,

31:41.720 --> 31:44.712
we've_identified seven shooters
With heavy body armor

31:44.770 --> 31:46.112
and what appear to be AKs.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.378
Any EOD problems
reported

31:48.420 --> 31:51.765
Nothing yet, but
everything's fluid.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.811
StateCan't assume that,
but it's likely.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.909
SONNY: So we've got an American
FSO trapped inside a hotel

31:56.950 --> 31:58.554
that's been taken over
by one

31:58.610 --> 32:01.989
of many "I hate Hindus
and Westerner" groups

32:02.050 --> 32:03.733
that kill and don't negotiate.

32:03.790 --> 32:05.212
ERIC:
That's a fair assessment.

32:05.270 --> 32:06.919
And if we don't get in there
in time, then we can count

32:06.960 --> 32:09.520
on Dave Nelson being amongst
those who die.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.836
Them jackasses in Mumbai
want some attention,

32:14.880 --> 32:16.757
bring some eyes to their cause,

32:16.800 --> 32:18.927
you make a sex tape
with a celebrity.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.925
TRENT:
Got to be an A-lister.SONNY: No, come on, man.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.754
They're a dime a
dozen these days.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.459
I bet you one
of them, uh--

32:24.500 --> 32:27.458
them Kardashian sisters
would be available. Yeah.

32:27.510 --> 32:31.116
Wouldn't have to have all
this bloodshed and kidnapping.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.412
Hey, why are we ignoring this?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.773
Come on, man.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.947
Jason didn't hear a word
of that warning order.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.810
Guy's not up for this.
Why am I the only one saying it?

32:43.090 --> 32:45.513
'Cause you're
the youngest, son.

32:45.570 --> 32:48.915
You may be 21C,

32:48.960 --> 32:50.780
but you need to refrain.

32:50.830 --> 32:52.354
All right?

32:52.400 --> 32:54.618
It ain't our decision to make.

34:08.950 --> 34:11.384
Hey. You okay?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.908
All right, I'm on my way.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.342
Sorry, Mikey. Uh...

34:16.400 --> 34:18.220
you're gonna have to
beat 'em on your own.

34:18.270 --> 34:20.704
They need me on base.

34:29.240 --> 34:30.969
RAY:
Jason.

34:32.110 --> 34:34.010
What's going on?

34:34.070 --> 34:35.844
I want to show you
something.

34:35.890 --> 34:37.676
What do you see there?

34:37.720 --> 34:39.984
You.

34:40.030 --> 34:41.588
Your beautiful kids.

34:44.990 --> 34:47.117
You're my friend, right?

34:47.170 --> 34:48.592
Yeah. Always.

34:48.650 --> 34:50.641
I need something from you.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.511
Anything.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.046
I need you back
on Bravo Team,

34:59.090 --> 35:01.741
if you're okay with that.

35:01.790 --> 35:05.317
Well, you already know
the answer.

35:05.360 --> 35:07.578
Been waiting to roll with you
six months.

35:07.620 --> 35:11.317
Yeah, well, the thing is,
I won't be there.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.710
What you see here,

35:15.760 --> 35:18.979
two beautiful kids.

35:19.020 --> 35:20.931
What I see,

35:20.980 --> 35:24.154
I see the only parent
they have left.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.116
I'm standing down.

35:34.130 --> 35:36.553
Just for this mission?

35:36.610 --> 35:38.032
Not forever.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.915
I don't know.

35:47.970 --> 35:50.393
I don't. know.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.879
First time I've been paged
since I've been at Green Team.

35:57.930 --> 35:58.885
What's happening?

35:58.930 --> 36:00.579
Wheels up for Mumbai in 20.

36:00.630 --> 36:02.188
Need you on that plane.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.969
As Bravo 1.

36:04.030 --> 36:05.452
Jason?

36:05.510 --> 36:07.410
Standing down.
His choice.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.202
Sometimes being a father's more
important than being a SEAL.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.854
Jason made
the right call.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.071
He won't regret it.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.941
100%.

36:27.570 --> 36:29.561
You didn't go?

36:30.660 --> 36:32.002
No.

36:33.450 --> 36:35.918
You've never stayed behind.

36:35.970 --> 36:38.052
Not ever. Not for anyone.

36:38.100 --> 36:40.239
Yeah. Come on, big guy.
Get up.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.192
Come on. You get up there.
I got you.

36:43.240 --> 36:46.937
Well, this time, this time I am.

36:48.460 --> 36:51.190
: I thought for
sure you were leaving.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.899
Shh, I know.

36:52.940 --> 36:56.205
Yeah. So... so did I.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.206
So did I.

36:59.210 --> 37:01.644
So did I.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.347
I'm here, okay?

37:30.460 --> 37:33.327
After days of threats following
Indian troop movements

37:33.380 --> 37:35.336
in the disputed territory
of Kashmir,

37:35.380 --> 37:38.281
Pakistani radicals,
the Hizbul Mujahideen,

37:38.340 --> 37:41.036
have launched what appear to be
multiple coordinated attacks

37:41.080 --> 37:42.900
across the city of Mumbai.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.293
We're waiting for confirmation,
but the latest reports suggest

37:45.350 --> 37:47.295
four separate locations
of the attacks,

37:47.350 --> 37:49.033
the Braman National Theatre,

37:49.090 --> 37:51.217
Tamerlane Gallery,
Khorana University,

37:51.260 --> 37:52.818
and the Sopara Grand Hotel,

37:52.870 --> 37:55.395
with multiple casualties
at each location.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.829
Brihanmumbai Police
have shut down the city,

37:57.880 --> 38:00.610
allowing only
authorized personnel in or out

38:00.660 --> 38:03.003
until the situation is resolved.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.278
[man speaking foreign language
over speaker]

38:09.370 --> 38:12.589
MAN: Military and police
vehicles and personnel only.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.929
Listen, Ray.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.242
Yeah.I know Bravo's your platoon.

38:19.290 --> 38:21.599
You've been Jason's go-to guy
for a long time.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.370
And I appreciate that.
But I'm coming in midstream.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.728
I trained Clay.
We've got a shorthand.

38:26.780 --> 38:28.509
So I'm gonna keep him
as 21C.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.903
I need you as Bravo 6,
running comms for me.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.178
Check. I'm on it.

38:33.220 --> 38:35.085
I'm just glad to
be back, brother.

38:35.130 --> 38:37.041
I hear you.
Feels good to be doing the job.

38:37.090 --> 38:38.307
Damn straight.

38:46.930 --> 38:48.272
How's it look?

38:48.320 --> 38:50.629
Good so far.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.825
Sitrep?

39:19.870 --> 39:21.610
Shots fired internally
ten minutes ago.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.742
Nothing external
in the last 20.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.519
Send the Hair Missile.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.878
Roger that.

39:59.350 --> 40:01.784
We're clear.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.489
HAVOC, this is Bravo 1.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.847
Entered main lobby.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.721
Cerberus,
first!

41:22.210 --> 41:24.030
Let's get ready
to rumble.

42:03.820 --> 42:06.129
It's a dry hole, boss.

42:07.610 --> 42:09.646
HAVOC Base, this is Bravo 1.

42:09.700 --> 42:11.304
ERIC:
Good copy, Bravo 1.

42:11.350 --> 42:13.306
HAVOC, we have a problem.

42:13.350 --> 42:14.567
Big one.

42:14.610 --> 42:15.872
FSO is gone.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.820
I say again,
our objective is gone.
