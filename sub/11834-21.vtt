WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:14.815
They made an offer --

00:14.848 --> 00:16.482
For 30 years.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.251
30 years?

00:18.284 --> 00:20.787
It's not unreasonable,
Jackie, for two murders.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.289
One. One murder,
and if you ask me,

00:23.323 --> 00:25.425
it was
a public service killing.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.293
The other one,
the kid --

00:27.327 --> 00:29.663
Everyone knows
that was an accident.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.264
No, under the law,

00:31.297 --> 00:33.233
that kind of accident
is called felony murder.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.701
The punishment is life,

00:34.735 --> 00:36.737
and you're looking
at a double life sentence.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.439
Let's go to trial.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.509
Look, Michael Biggs
was a small-time dealer.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.244
You want to take out
your competition, fine,

00:44.277 --> 00:46.580
and maybe, like you say,
some idiot on the jury

00:46.613 --> 00:48.148
will think you did
the public a favor,

00:48.181 --> 00:50.283
but Anthony Halpern
was an innocent kid.

00:50.316 --> 00:51.852
He didn't deserve
to get shot in the head,

00:51.885 --> 00:53.486
and I don't think
the jury --

00:53.520 --> 00:55.321
If I gave you the impression
that I had anything to do

00:55.355 --> 00:58.825
with those killings,
that was a misunderstanding.

01:01.828 --> 01:04.464
I am going to trial.

01:04.497 --> 01:06.767
You realize we don't have
a strong defense here.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.434
If you were working
on this case

01:08.468 --> 01:10.170
instead of counting
on a plea,

01:10.203 --> 01:11.705
maybe you'd figure
something out by now.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.707
You want to know
what I figured out, Jackie?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.176
I figured out that I can't
put you on the stand

01:16.209 --> 01:17.611
without suborning perjury.

01:17.644 --> 01:19.546
I also figured out
that with your record,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.114
you can expect
consecutive life terms

01:21.147 --> 01:22.415
with no chance for parole.

01:22.448 --> 01:24.384
We are not going to lose.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.119
They've got an eyewitness.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.121
Which we don't need
to worry about.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.190
What do you mean, "We don't
need to worry about"?

01:30.223 --> 01:32.125
I interviewed him myself.
He's credible.

01:32.158 --> 01:33.159
Bobby --

01:33.193 --> 01:36.630
Do not worry
about the witness.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.337
You're going
to have to tell me

01:44.370 --> 01:45.739
what that means, Jackie,
because I know

01:45.772 --> 01:47.240
you're not going to harm
that witness.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.909
I'm in jail.
What-- What could I do?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.677
Listen to me.

01:50.711 --> 01:53.146
You're already in more trouble
than I think we can handle.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.380
You do not want
to make things worse

01:54.414 --> 01:56.482
by intimidating
a witness.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.618
Okay. I understand.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.119
Look at me.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.159
I understand.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.802
â™ª (theme)

03:07.020 --> 03:08.755
Did he threaten him
or not?

03:08.789 --> 03:09.823
Well --

03:09.856 --> 03:11.457
We think
he kind of did.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.458
What do you mean,
you think he did?

03:12.492 --> 03:13.760
He said

03:13.794 --> 03:15.361
we didn't need
to worry about the witness,

03:15.395 --> 03:16.763
and I don't think
it was a compliment

03:16.797 --> 03:17.998
to Bobby's
cross-examination skills.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.633
Well, then,
you need to tell Bay.

03:19.666 --> 03:21.502
What if he meant
something totally different?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.505
You know, "Don't worry,
the witness is a friend of mine"

03:24.538 --> 03:26.673
Or "I got proof
the witness is lying."

03:26.707 --> 03:29.843
-Oh, right.
-What did you say?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.312
I laid it out. He can't
be intimidating witnesses.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.380
He said he understood,
but whether he really did...

03:34.414 --> 03:35.415
EUGENE: Ellenor?

03:35.448 --> 03:37.684
I couldn't be sure.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.787
Then you say nothing.
Leaving aside what he meant,

03:40.821 --> 03:43.256
what he said is protected
by attorney/client privilege.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.791
You can't reveal it

03:44.825 --> 03:47.260
unless he intends
to commit a future crime,

03:47.293 --> 03:48.294
and if you're not sure --

03:48.328 --> 03:49.696
We don't need this.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.633
You were just on trial
for conspiring with a client.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.001
If you don't say anything
and a witness ends up dead,

03:55.035 --> 03:57.270
you could be up against
obstruction of justice charges.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.405
You want to wait
for some package to explode?

03:59.439 --> 04:01.775
If there's any chance
this witness is in danger,

04:01.808 --> 04:03.476
you have to say something.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.414
Jimmy?

04:08.448 --> 04:12.452
None of us was in the room,
Bobby. Only you two.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.291
Let's just lay down the law
with him again

04:18.324 --> 04:19.325
and then decide.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.598
I told you, I understand.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.433
Can you tell me
why you even said it --

04:27.467 --> 04:29.536
That we don't have to worry
about the witness?

04:29.570 --> 04:32.506
Look,
back in my shrink days --

04:32.539 --> 04:34.841
I bet you didn't know
I used to get therapy.

04:34.875 --> 04:35.842
Did you know this?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.944
No, you seem so grounded.

04:37.978 --> 04:43.016
My shrink said that
when I'm feeling powerless,

04:43.049 --> 04:46.452
I act more brave
and tough.

04:46.486 --> 04:49.590
Now, my life's been taken
from me here.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.559
I'm sitting
in a cell all day.

04:52.593 --> 04:56.630
My future's in the hands
of this eyewitness.

04:56.663 --> 05:00.501
I guess I just needed to feel
more powerful than him,

05:00.534 --> 05:05.005
and so I said that.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.307
Does it make sense?

05:13.547 --> 05:17.651
Anthony had just taken me
home from school.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.052
He was your boyfriend?

05:19.085 --> 05:20.486
Yes.

05:20.521 --> 05:24.991
We were sitting in the car
talking, and...

05:25.025 --> 05:26.893
I know this is hard,
Lisa,

05:26.927 --> 05:29.763
but do you remember
where the car was parked?

05:29.796 --> 05:32.398
In front of my building.

05:32.432 --> 05:35.135
Okay.
Now, take your time.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.938
I want you to tell us
what happened.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.877
He was telling me
about how he was

05:43.910 --> 05:48.114
going to play basketball
for B. U. when he graduated.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.384
It's all he could talk
about sometimes.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.823
Then, all of a sudden,
the windows started breaking.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.825
On which side of the car?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.961
His.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.431
He'd been shot.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.668
Where?

06:07.701 --> 06:10.537
In the head...

06:10.571 --> 06:13.106
And he just looked at me.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.846
He didn't understand
what was happening.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.552
Ms. Matthews,

06:25.586 --> 06:29.122
did you see the person
who did this?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.824
No.

06:30.857 --> 06:34.127
Did you see my client
at all that afternoon?

06:34.160 --> 06:36.863
I don't think so.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.566
Thank you.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.867
No further questions.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.806
I'm very sorry
for the loss of your friend.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.012
Mr. Bay?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.880
No redirect, your honor.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.684
The commonwealth calls
Detective Michael McGuire.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.554
The intended victim
was Michael Biggs, 23.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.988
When I arrived
on the scene,

07:02.022 --> 07:03.890
his body was
on the sidewalk area

07:03.924 --> 07:04.991
directly in front
of his building.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.893
RICHARD: Were you able
to determine

07:06.927 --> 07:09.095
from which direction
the shooter approached?

07:09.129 --> 07:11.765
Yes, he approached
from across the street

07:11.798 --> 07:13.199
and opened fire.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.901
Stray bullets were lodged
in the front of the building

07:14.935 --> 07:17.203
and a few in the cars
that were parked out front.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.740
Which is where you found
the second victim --

07:19.773 --> 07:21.174
Anthony Halpern.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.709
Yes, in his car.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.010
He had been shot
in the back of the head.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.779
And Michael Biggs--

07:25.812 --> 07:28.014
Why do you consider him
the intended victim?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.150
We found him
lying face-down.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.052
He had been shot
six times --

07:32.085 --> 07:34.788
Twice in the legs,
three times in the chest,

07:34.821 --> 07:37.190
and once in the head
at very close range.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.125
And how do you know that,
Detective?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.927
There were stippling burns
on his head and neck,

07:40.961 --> 07:42.696
indicating
that the gun had been fired

07:42.729 --> 07:45.599
from a distance
of no more than 6 inches.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.268
We considered it
an execution.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.505
You didn't find a gun
at the crime scene,

07:51.538 --> 07:52.673
did you?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.675
The murder weapon
was never recovered.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.976
A fingerprint
on a shell casing

07:56.009 --> 07:57.711
to implicate my client?

07:57.744 --> 07:59.780
There were no prints,
Mr. Donnell, as you
already know.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.982
Michael Biggs was a convicted
drug dealer, wasn't he?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.818
Yes, he had a felony record
for selling narcotics.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.520
That's a dangerous business,
right, detective?

08:06.553 --> 08:07.821
Ask your client.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.122
Objection. Move to strike.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.091
Sustained.
Detective McGuire.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.193
My point, Detective,

08:13.226 --> 08:15.228
is that Mr. Biggs
was the kind of man

08:15.261 --> 08:17.531
who might have
a few enemies. Yes or no?

08:17.564 --> 08:18.965
Yes.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.767
After the shooting,
did they find my client

08:20.801 --> 08:21.835
anywhere
in the neighborhood?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.770
No.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.706
In fact, Mr. Cahill
wasn't arrested

08:25.739 --> 08:27.641
till three days later,
when he voluntarily appeared

08:27.674 --> 08:29.242
at the precinct
for questioning.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.778
We had already searched
his house and his bar.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.179
He knew we were looking
to make an arrest.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.015
That's exactly my point.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.251
This man who supposedly killed
two people had three days

08:39.284 --> 08:42.022
to leave the city,
the state, the country,

08:42.054 --> 08:44.691
and instead, he comes
walking into your precinct

08:44.725 --> 08:46.560
to answer questions.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.295
Yes.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.002
Will I be up there long?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.772
Not on direct.
Just say what you saw.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.708
When I ask you to identify
the man you saw fire the gun,

09:01.742 --> 09:04.010
if you see him in the room,
point to him.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.312
They may keep you up there
on cross for a while.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.914
Why?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.816
Well, you're our whole case,
Mr. Ross,

09:09.850 --> 09:11.952
and the defense
certainly knows that.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.721
They're going to try everything
they can to tear you apart.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.923
This didn't seem
so scary a week ago.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.058
You'll be fine.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.192
Just stick
to the truth.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.927
Richard.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.596
We'll see you tomorrow.

09:25.031 --> 09:27.033
He's not
in protective custody?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.735
Why should he be?

09:28.769 --> 09:30.671
I just thought
for big drug cases,

09:30.704 --> 09:31.672
you keep your witnesses
in protective custody.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.306
This is a murder case.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.141
Well, I guess
if it were me,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.010
I'd be keeping
an eye on him.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.945
What are you saying?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.280
Nothing.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.382
Yes, you are.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.618
If you're trying
to get me rattled,

09:44.651 --> 09:46.620
or you're hoping I'm going
to go and rattle my witness --

09:46.653 --> 09:48.755
I'm just saying it would be
a good idea to protect him.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.826
If you have knowledge
that he's in danger

09:52.859 --> 09:54.194
I don't have
any specific knowledge,

09:54.227 --> 09:57.363
but my radar says
protect your witness.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.732
Bobby.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.701
That's all
I'm going to say.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.313
Their eyewitnesses
are up next.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.648
Once he's done,

10:14.681 --> 10:16.249
the commonwealth
should rest.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.884
They're guarding his house.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.352
Excuse me?

10:19.385 --> 10:21.254
The witness.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.989
Cops put a guard
on his house.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.991
Now, why the hell
would they do that?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.694
It's a murder trial, Jackie.
I'm sure that's routine.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.663
No, I don't think so.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.164
If this were federal,
maybe,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.967
but state, no.
They don't protect a witness

10:34.000 --> 10:35.736
unless they think
he's in danger.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.403
And how
would you know that?

10:37.437 --> 10:39.405
You don't find
it interesting,

10:39.439 --> 10:41.808
you and I have a conversation
about this witness,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.044
and the very next day,
there's a cop at his house?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.246
He's the only witness
to a double murder.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.914
With your record --

10:47.948 --> 10:50.050
Richard Bay is a smart guy.
He doesn't need me

10:50.083 --> 10:52.352
to know his witness
should be protected.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.354
That's not exactly
a denial, Bobby.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.089
As long
as we're into accusations,

10:56.122 --> 10:58.759
how do you even know there was
a guard on that house?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.260
Did you send somebody
out there?

11:00.293 --> 11:01.728
No, I did not,

11:01.762 --> 11:03.764
but just so we have
an understanding,

11:03.797 --> 11:05.365
if I were ever
to find out

11:05.398 --> 11:08.735
that my lawyer
had been talking to the cops

11:08.769 --> 11:11.271
about certain conversations
he and I had in private,

11:11.304 --> 11:13.974
I would consider that
an act of disloyalty.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.809
You want me off this case?
No problem.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.110
Let's you and me
go see the judge,

11:17.143 --> 11:18.812
and you can explain
all about

11:18.845 --> 11:20.213
how I prevented your people
from taking out a witness.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.315
I never said I was
going to take him out.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.917
Did I ever say that?

11:23.950 --> 11:26.152
Look, let's just stop
with the antagonism

11:26.186 --> 11:27.788
and focus on the case,

11:27.821 --> 11:31.257
which, I remind you,
doesn't look so good.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.937
What if I have an alibi?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.906
What are you
talking about?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.808
This guy I work with
at the bar --

11:47.841 --> 11:49.976
I was working with him
when this whole thing happened.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.277
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.113
You can't just offer
alibi evidence

11:53.146 --> 11:54.280
in the middle of a trial.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.849
There's a procedure.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.751
We need to serve notice
weeks in advance.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.419
I'm sure
you can figure that out.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.287
And what is
this sudden alibi?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.423
I can't offer testimony
I know to be false.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.392
I am innocent.
Do you get that?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
And this alibi is legit.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.330
Then why didn't you tell me
about it sooner?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.164
ELLENOR: All right!

12:13.066 --> 12:15.301
Why didn't you tell us
about the witness

12:15.335 --> 12:17.237
before now, Jackie?

12:17.270 --> 12:22.442
Because there's a warrant out
for his arrest in New York.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.946
That explanation okay,
counselor?

12:29.550 --> 12:31.785
He's a lying piece of--

12:31.818 --> 12:33.353
You don't know that.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.188
You think
he has an alibi?

12:35.221 --> 12:37.423
No, but if he says
he does --

12:37.457 --> 12:38.925
It's his defense.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.527
Bobby, he's looking
at double life.

12:40.561 --> 12:42.328
If he wants to call
an alibi witness,

12:42.362 --> 12:43.496
then that's what we do.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.998
We interview the guy,

12:45.031 --> 12:46.466
and we try and put him
on the stand.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.368
If the judge
will even let us.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.906
They come up with this now,
in the middle of the trial?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.007
I just found out
about it myself.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.008
Bobby...

12:55.041 --> 12:56.009
It's true.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.343
There's an alibi witness

12:57.377 --> 12:59.546
and your client
just tells you now?

12:59.580 --> 13:01.815
Yes, there's an outstanding
warrant for the guy's arrest,

13:01.848 --> 13:02.949
and he didn't want
to come forward.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.484
Oh, come on.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.286
I've had no opportunity
to see if his story checks out,

13:06.319 --> 13:08.288
no opportunity
to run his record --

13:08.321 --> 13:10.390
You can't deny my client
the right to put on a defense.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.825
Courts have upheld

13:11.858 --> 13:13.193
the exclusion
of defense witnesses.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
Whether Mr. Donnell
believes it or not,

13:15.261 --> 13:17.097
we're entitled
to a fair trial, too.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.832
We wouldn't oppose
a continuance

13:18.865 --> 13:20.466
to give Mr. Bay
time to investigate.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.036
I'm sure you wouldn't,
but I am not going

13:23.069 --> 13:25.471
to delay things
and inconvenience the jury

13:25.506 --> 13:27.874
because you violated
discovery rules.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.309
There's another option.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.977
Let him voir dire
the witness

13:31.011 --> 13:32.513
outside the presence
of the jury.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.915
Let him get all the discovery
he needs now.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.519
That seems reasonable.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.522
It's a good thing.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.590
That way we can see if
our little witness holds up.

13:43.624 --> 13:46.092
Satisfactory, Mr. Bay?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.028
-Well --
-We reserve the right

13:48.061 --> 13:50.564
to argue for exclusion
if anything that comes up

13:50.597 --> 13:52.432
requires
further investigation.

13:52.465 --> 13:57.070
Fine. Mr. Donnell,
bring in your new witness.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.908
They get
to check him out first?

14:01.942 --> 14:02.909
Yes.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.210
Well, how does
that happen?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.912
What, they get
a free bite?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.380
It happens when
you suddenly announce

14:07.413 --> 14:08.582
you have an alibi

14:08.615 --> 14:10.483
after the trial
has started.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.219
The judge is allowing them
some discovery.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.191
What about
a new offer, hmm?

14:18.224 --> 14:21.027
I mean, just the fact
this witness exists --

14:21.061 --> 14:23.263
Hasn't the D.A.
got a new offer?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.231
He can't
be so cocky now.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.133
I don't think
you fully grasp

14:27.167 --> 14:29.069
this particular D. A.,
Jackie.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.371
Richard Bay --
In addition to being good,

14:31.404 --> 14:34.074
he is pathologically
competitive.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.577
He'd want you to get life
even if you were innocent.

14:36.610 --> 14:38.344
Which I am.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.181
Oh, right.
I forgot.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.250
So what's going
to happen?

14:44.284 --> 14:48.488
The D. A. gets to question him
in a sealed room, no jury.

14:48.522 --> 14:51.057
The judge will make
a determination as to whether

14:51.091 --> 14:53.960
further investigation
is called for.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.962
If so, we delay the trial.

14:55.996 --> 14:59.365
If not, the trial
picks up where we left off.

15:01.101 --> 15:05.071
How exactly airtight do you
consider your alibi to be?

15:05.105 --> 15:07.708
I was with Mr. Cahill
the whole afternoon.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.375
And he never left the bar?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.644
Never out of my sight.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.245
I was serving,

15:12.278 --> 15:14.314
he was at a table
going over the expense books.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.550
Cahill is your boss,
is he not?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.719
No. It's my bar.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.654
-It's your bar?
-Yes, it is.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.689
My name
is on the liquor license.

15:22.723 --> 15:24.591
But he was doing
the books.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.192
Is he your accountant?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.562
No, he's an investor.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.463
Oh, he's an investor.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.133
What percentage of your bar
does he own?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.368
I don't know -- Most.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.470
And tell us,
who suggested

15:37.504 --> 15:39.472
you come here today
to testify?

15:39.506 --> 15:43.476
Nobody. I told Mr. Cahill
I'd come here and do it.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.478
Did you get
in touch with him

15:45.512 --> 15:48.014
or did he call you?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.050
I'm not sure.
I think he called me.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.384
From prison?

15:51.417 --> 15:53.219
You know all outgoing
phone calls from prison

15:53.253 --> 15:54.220
are recorded?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.422
Mr. Inteso,

15:56.456 --> 15:59.359
why didn't
you come forward sooner?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.294
I have
an outstanding warrant

16:01.327 --> 16:03.296
on an assault charge
in New York.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.231
So you know
by testifying here,

16:05.265 --> 16:07.133
you're going
to go back to jail.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.301
Yeah.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.336
You'd rather testify
and go to jail

16:10.370 --> 16:12.072
than say no
to Mr. Cahill?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.439
I want to help him.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.776
He was with me
at the time of the shooting.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.245
There's no question.
Beyond reasonable doubt.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.215
Okay, you were
serving drinks,

16:22.248 --> 16:23.684
he was working.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.452
Did anybody else see you
or the defendant that day?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.322
I don't know. Maybe.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.091
Can you tell us
who else was there?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.159
I don't really remember.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.328
You don't.

16:35.361 --> 16:39.199
These books the defendant
was working on --

16:39.232 --> 16:40.767
Where are they now?

16:42.736 --> 16:45.371
What?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.107
It's your bar.
Surely you know

16:47.140 --> 16:48.709
where your own
expense books are.

16:48.742 --> 16:52.078
Objection. This isn't
a tax case. It's irrelevant.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.280
It's very relevant
to this witness's credibility.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.216
We move the witness
turn over the books

16:56.249 --> 16:58.752
the defendant
was working on.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.357
I lost the books.

17:06.392 --> 17:07.794
I see.

17:07.828 --> 17:09.596
Your honor, at this time,

17:09.630 --> 17:12.766
I withdraw my motion
to exclude this witness.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.541
We can't
put him up there.

17:21.575 --> 17:23.242
It's still an alibi.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.478
They can't prove he's lying,
which he isn't.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.681
They wouldn't have to
prove he's lying.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.816
He looks like it,
he sounds like it,

17:29.850 --> 17:31.818
he -- He personifies
dishonesty,

17:31.852 --> 17:33.654
and by putting him
up there,

17:33.687 --> 17:35.522
we would be helping
the prosecution, trust me.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.524
Why the hell
didn't you protect him?

17:37.558 --> 17:39.660
You should have been
objecting or something.

17:39.693 --> 17:41.728
The questions
weren't objectionable,

17:41.762 --> 17:43.229
and it was discovery.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.365
Look, 30 years
is better than life,

17:45.398 --> 17:46.833
if it's still on the table.

17:46.867 --> 17:47.868
No!

17:47.901 --> 17:49.269
Try to get this --

17:49.302 --> 17:51.271
We got no rabbits to pull.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.773
What about
your plan "B" Strategy?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.608
A witness saw you
pull the trigger.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.544
Plus, this D. A.,
he knows us.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.547
And I know him. He is not
going to drop the ball.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.283
We cannot win this case.

18:18.231 --> 18:21.267
All right.
Let me think about it.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.169
Can I think about it?

18:23.203 --> 18:25.706
We're not scheduled
to go again till tomorrow,

18:25.739 --> 18:28.575
so, yeah.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.410
Take the night.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.248
Look...

18:35.281 --> 18:37.918
You think we don't like you,
which is true.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.821
You think
because we don't like you,

18:40.854 --> 18:45.726
we are not doing
everything we possibly can,

18:45.759 --> 18:47.861
which is not true.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.664
Okay.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.267
Okay.

19:30.571 --> 19:31.938
Hello?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.843
Is somebody there?

19:36.877 --> 19:37.944
Ooh!

19:40.446 --> 19:42.215
MAN: This is simple.

19:42.248 --> 19:43.650
If the case
against Jackie Cahill

19:43.684 --> 19:44.685
doesn't go away...

19:45.986 --> 19:47.420
You will.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.323
(groans)

19:50.356 --> 19:52.392
The only reason
you're still alive

19:52.425 --> 19:55.529
is because
you're still useful.

19:55.562 --> 20:01.535
You do not want to win
this case. Understand?

20:01.568 --> 20:03.937
I'm going
to leave you now,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.438
and when I do,

20:05.471 --> 20:07.741
you're going
to start feeling better --

20:07.774 --> 20:09.810
Feeling brave.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.646
Maybe you can
call the police.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.548
That's why it's important
for you to remember

20:14.581 --> 20:17.718
what I'm going
to say right now --

20:17.751 --> 20:20.320
We can always get to you.

20:21.555 --> 20:23.423
If we want you dead...

20:23.456 --> 20:25.959
You, dead.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.562
Now, stay right here
for five minutes,

20:28.595 --> 20:32.332
and then you can
go about living your life.

20:32.365 --> 20:37.804
How much of it is left,
that's up to you.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.754
(shivering)

21:10.036 --> 21:12.038
Richard, of course
you have to report this.

21:12.072 --> 21:13.507
Why haven't you already --

21:13.540 --> 21:15.041
If I report it,
I let him win. I--I just --

21:15.075 --> 21:16.543
How do you figure that?

21:16.577 --> 21:17.844
He's hoping I'll report it

21:17.878 --> 21:19.513
and try
to resign from the case,

21:19.546 --> 21:21.014
or he'll try
to have me removed.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.649
The judge
might do it anyway.

21:22.683 --> 21:24.050
The trial gets delayed --

21:24.084 --> 21:25.552
First of all,
that doesn't have to happen.

21:25.586 --> 21:26.653
You could still continue.

21:26.687 --> 21:28.421
Oh, you know Bobby. He --

21:28.454 --> 21:30.323
Secondly,
your life was threatened.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.892
A crime was committed.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.827
You're an officer of the court.
You have to report it.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.997
Come on, do I really need
to be telling you that?

21:39.600 --> 21:40.801
What?

21:40.834 --> 21:45.005
He said if I told the police,
I'd die.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.342
You're scared.

21:49.375 --> 21:52.445
Yes.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.582
Helen, even if I did
file a report,

21:55.616 --> 21:57.651
I didn't even see him.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.553
He's disguised his voice.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.988
There's no way
I could make an I. D.

22:02.022 --> 22:03.724
They could
dust your garage.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.559
Maybe there are
tire tracks,

22:05.592 --> 22:07.961
witnesses in the neighborhood
who saw the car.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.763
The police
could investigate.

22:12.132 --> 22:13.700
Richard, you need
to report this.

22:13.734 --> 22:15.669
If you won't, I will.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.006
All right.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.875
I'm going to call
Detective McGuire.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.076
We'll start
the investigation.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.611
We'll put you
in protective custody.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.580
Someone will be with you
around the clock.

22:26.613 --> 22:27.581
We'll guard your house.

22:27.614 --> 22:28.682
Helen --

22:28.715 --> 22:30.817
Until the verdict.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.786
Now, I'm gonna
have to talk to Bobby.

22:32.819 --> 22:33.787
Why?

22:33.820 --> 22:36.757
Because he has to know.

22:36.790 --> 22:41.161
Now, the only
remaining question --

22:41.194 --> 22:44.364
Are you okay to continue
with the trial?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.634
Yes.

22:47.668 --> 22:48.869
Are you sure?

22:48.902 --> 22:51.404
Yes.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.840
And you'll be going
for a conviction, right?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.378
Yes.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.188
In his own garage?

23:08.221 --> 23:10.456
Yes. I'm assuming
you gave him no indication.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.491
Of course not.

23:11.525 --> 23:12.993
Does he know

23:13.026 --> 23:14.060
that knocking off the D. A.
won't do much good?

23:14.094 --> 23:15.095
We do have more.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.534
We may have led him
to believe

23:20.567 --> 23:24.004
that this particular D. A.
was a nemesis.

23:24.037 --> 23:25.906
We will set him straight
on that.

23:25.939 --> 23:27.140
What an idiot.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.742
So where are we?

23:28.775 --> 23:30.877
Richard's bent on continuing.
You know him.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.513
Now you will have
a conversation

23:32.546 --> 23:33.514
with your client.

23:33.547 --> 23:36.650
Oh, yes.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.919
-I am as shocked as you are.
-Don't give me that.

23:38.952 --> 23:40.721
Are you that stupid?

23:40.754 --> 23:43.156
You think killing the district
attorney will actually help you?

23:43.189 --> 23:45.491
I would never hurt anybody,
Ms. Frutt,

23:45.526 --> 23:46.893
but you know what?

23:46.927 --> 23:49.796
Our relationship has
so deteriorated here,

23:49.830 --> 23:51.732
that maybe you two should
get off this case.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.467
I should find myself
new representation.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.803
So you can buy time?
Time to execute the witness?

23:56.837 --> 23:58.905
We'd love to get off, Jackie,
but the judge

23:58.939 --> 24:01.742
will never let that happen,
not at this point.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.510
If you told him
that your disgust prevents you

24:03.544 --> 24:05.111
from doing your best work --

24:05.145 --> 24:07.748
The problem is, I do my
my best work for
disgusting clients.

24:07.781 --> 24:11.184
We're stuck with each other.
The trial is going on.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.819
There's plenty more
district attorneys

24:12.853 --> 24:14.254
where Richard Bay came from,

24:14.287 --> 24:16.156
so going after him
will get you nothing.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.958
Nothing?

24:17.991 --> 24:21.662
No. You underestimate
the value of a smile.

24:23.196 --> 24:26.867
It's the simple pleasures,
counsel.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.507
I heard a series of pops.
I don't know how many.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.609
They were loud,
like explosions.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.110
And what happened next,
sir?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.212
I looked up
through the windshield

24:39.245 --> 24:40.981
of my car, and I saw the man
with the gun

24:41.014 --> 24:43.249
walking across the street,
firing.

24:43.283 --> 24:45.619
Bullets were going everywhere.

24:49.089 --> 24:51.592
This was in daylight?

24:51.625 --> 24:53.126
Middle of the day, yes.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.861
Okay,
what happened next?

24:54.895 --> 24:56.530
The man with the gun
was shooting at the man

24:56.563 --> 24:57.998
lying on the sidewalk.

24:58.031 --> 25:00.867
He walked up and shot
right at the guy's head.

25:00.901 --> 25:03.870
How far away were you
from the man who was shooting?

25:03.904 --> 25:06.006
Uh, maybe 60 feet.
No more than that.

25:11.177 --> 25:15.582
Do you see the man
who was shooting that day?

25:15.616 --> 25:18.251
Him. That man
sitting right there.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.821
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified

25:20.854 --> 25:22.989
the defendant
Jackie Cahill.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.596
Nothing further.

25:34.935 --> 25:36.570
What were you doing
on that street

25:36.603 --> 25:37.971
the day of the shooting?

25:38.004 --> 25:39.840
I work for a courier service.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.142
I was delivering a package
in the area a little earlier.

25:42.175 --> 25:45.779
You said you heard the sound,
then you looked up.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.313
What were you doing
in your car?

25:47.347 --> 25:49.750
-Resting.
-Resting...

25:49.783 --> 25:51.017
Or sleeping?

25:51.051 --> 25:53.119
I guess maybe I dozed off.

25:53.153 --> 25:55.321
You guess?
You don't remember?

25:55.355 --> 25:57.824
Well, I work two jobs.
I'd been up all night.

25:57.858 --> 25:59.893
I guess I was sleeping.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.795
So when you heard the popping,
it woke you

26:01.828 --> 26:03.697
-out of a deep sleep?
-I--I don't know how deep.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.966
But coming out of a sleep
groggy, it took you some time

26:05.999 --> 26:07.934
to focus
on what was happening.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.836
Maybe a few moments,
but when I saw your client

26:09.870 --> 26:12.272
start shooting,
it woke me up fast.

26:12.305 --> 26:13.940
What was
the entire length of time

26:13.974 --> 26:16.176
you observed these events
once you woke up?

26:16.209 --> 26:19.012
-A few seconds.
-A few seconds.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.981
Did the shooter ever look
directly toward you,

26:21.014 --> 26:22.783
or did you only see him
from the side?

26:22.816 --> 26:24.685
From the side.

26:24.718 --> 26:26.753
And once you realized what
was happening, you were scared.

26:26.787 --> 26:28.689
-I guess. Yeah.
-You ducked down in your car.

26:28.722 --> 26:34.060
Maybe a little,
but I saw him. It was him.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.395
Did Mr. Bay tell you
if you got into trouble

26:35.428 --> 26:37.097
testifying,
just to repeat that?

26:37.130 --> 26:41.301
-Objection.
-Withdrawn. Nothing further.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.203
Brief redirect, your honor?

26:43.236 --> 26:46.139
Proceed.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.046
The windows of your car --
They're tinted?

26:53.079 --> 26:55.115
Yeah.
Yeah, it's hard to see in.

26:55.148 --> 26:57.183
So the man shooting --
You saw him, but --

26:57.217 --> 26:58.719
He wouldn't have known
I was there.

26:58.752 --> 27:00.821
-Objection.
-Sustained.

27:00.854 --> 27:02.956
Don't tell us
what the man knew.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.290
You got
a good look at him?

27:04.324 --> 27:05.759
Absolutely.

27:05.792 --> 27:09.696
As you sit here now,
are you sure who it was?

27:09.730 --> 27:13.867
Yes.
It was the defendant.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.669
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.137
Nothing further.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.309
Nothing further.

27:23.343 --> 27:26.012
The witness may step down.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.781
Mr. Bay?

27:27.814 --> 27:31.117
The commonwealth rests,
your honor.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.053
Mr. Donnell?

27:43.363 --> 27:44.698
The defense rests.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.133
(audience murmuring)

27:52.806 --> 27:54.908
How do I not testify?

27:54.941 --> 27:56.276
If you want to,
you can.

27:56.309 --> 27:57.911
I can still
make that happen.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.179
But you don't want
to do that.

27:59.212 --> 28:01.047
-Why?
-If you testify, Jackie,

28:01.081 --> 28:03.283
all your priors could
come in to impeach.

28:03.316 --> 28:05.719
And what are you going to say
that would actually help you?

28:05.752 --> 28:08.822
I'll say I didn't do it.
The witness was wrong.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.957
Look, you can testify.
It's your choice.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.793
Right now we're almost desperate
enough to put you up there,

28:12.826 --> 28:14.327
and if I could think
of the slightest upside,

28:14.360 --> 28:15.461
I would,
but in my opinion --

28:15.495 --> 28:17.463
Mine, too.

28:17.497 --> 28:19.332
It'll just
make things worse.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.869
Your felony record will serve
to bolster that witness.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.345
All right.
Get me a meeting with Bay.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.214
Why?

28:34.247 --> 28:36.216
I want to reopen
a plea-bargain discussion.

28:36.249 --> 28:38.351
-I'm not sure he'd be open --
-Get me the meeting.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.820
We can meet
with him, then --

28:39.853 --> 28:41.487
I want to be there.

28:41.522 --> 28:44.124
Get me a meeting
with Richard Bay.

28:53.967 --> 28:56.102
-He's in the witness room?
-Yes.

28:56.136 --> 28:57.504
Richard, you've
asked me three times

28:57.538 --> 28:58.839
if he's in the witness room,

28:58.872 --> 29:00.507
and you're
sweating like a pig.

29:00.541 --> 29:02.242
I'm fine.

29:02.275 --> 29:05.045
My life was threatened, Helen.
Allow me to perspire a little.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.513
Are you really okay?

29:06.547 --> 29:08.882
I'm fine. Let's go.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.157
All right, we're here.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.825
What's this about?

29:18.859 --> 29:21.261
Our client would like to reopen
a plea negotiation.

29:21.294 --> 29:22.896
Why?

29:22.929 --> 29:25.131
Not feeling very confident,
Mr. Cahill?

29:25.165 --> 29:26.867
You're sexy.

29:26.900 --> 29:30.403
Anybody ever tell you that?
Hmm?

29:30.436 --> 29:31.572
I could throw you
on this table

29:31.605 --> 29:32.973
and have sex with you
right now,

29:33.006 --> 29:34.875
even with all
these people watching.

29:34.908 --> 29:36.843
Any interest?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.384
Guard...

29:44.417 --> 29:46.887
Please handcuff this man
to the chair.

29:46.920 --> 29:48.288
Why?

29:48.321 --> 29:50.156
Well, you either
frighten me, Mr. Cahill,

29:50.190 --> 29:52.225
or you piss me off.
It's one or the other.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.435
40 years.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.571
The deal you offered
was 30.

30:04.605 --> 30:06.306
That was before I had
to go to trial.

30:06.339 --> 30:08.174
Your case hasn't
gotten any better.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.576
It's still just one witness
who didn't get a great look.

30:09.610 --> 30:11.311
Why risk it?

30:11.344 --> 30:13.379
40 years,
take it or leave it.

30:15.081 --> 30:17.918
This little prick
doesn't even think I'm guilty.

30:17.951 --> 30:19.553
-Jackie!
-If he really thought

30:19.586 --> 30:21.522
I killed two people,
what does he think

30:21.555 --> 30:23.056
I'm going to do to him
if he convicts me, hmm?

30:23.089 --> 30:25.458
If he's not afraid of that,

30:25.491 --> 30:26.993
he must believe
I'm innocent.

30:27.027 --> 30:28.461
Keep your mouth shut.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.230
He must think I can't
get to him from prison --

30:30.263 --> 30:33.399
If I were the killer,
that is.

30:33.433 --> 30:35.335
You think you scare us,
Mr. Cahill?

30:35.368 --> 30:38.505
You, me, and this table.
Five minutes.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.910
Come on, Helen.

30:48.481 --> 30:52.085
How stupid are you,
saying that in front of him?

30:52.118 --> 30:54.154
I was talking to you,
my lawyer.

30:54.187 --> 30:56.623
Threatening the prosecutor,
are you out of your mind?

30:56.657 --> 30:58.224
He can still add charges.

30:58.258 --> 31:00.460
No, he won't.
I know when a guy is scared,

31:00.493 --> 31:02.495
and he's pissing himself
right now.

31:02.529 --> 31:05.532
I'll bet his closing is
a little subpar.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.233
You actually think
he's going to blow this case

31:07.267 --> 31:08.569
because he's afraid of you?

31:08.602 --> 31:10.170
You give these guys
too much credit.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.572
They only prosecute

31:11.605 --> 31:13.473
because they can't find
real law jobs.

31:13.507 --> 31:16.142
Losing one case doesn't make
one difference to them,

31:16.176 --> 31:18.612
but if he thinks
he'll pay a price

31:18.645 --> 31:21.582
for convicting me --

31:21.615 --> 31:24.384
Look at me.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.119
Are you going
to do something to him

31:26.152 --> 31:28.488
if you lose here?

31:28.522 --> 31:32.125
He has to think I will.

31:32.158 --> 31:33.426
Why?

31:36.429 --> 31:40.066
Because it's my only chance.

31:42.636 --> 31:44.938
I'll close.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.373
You can't close.
It's my case.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.009
Richard,
you're not of the mind.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.276
What do you mean
I'm not of the mind?

31:50.310 --> 31:51.612
He's gotten to you.
You're rattled.

31:51.645 --> 31:53.279
I am not.
I am perfectly --

31:53.313 --> 31:55.115
Look, you're
understandably frightened.

31:55.148 --> 31:57.117
-You seem distracted.
-I've prepared my closing,

31:57.150 --> 31:58.552
and I'm ready
to deliver it.

31:58.585 --> 32:00.286
I can't let him
intimidate me.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.990
He already has.

32:04.024 --> 32:07.060
Richard, you don't have to be
the big hero here.

32:09.029 --> 32:11.164
It's not about being a hero,
Helen.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.233
It's about being me.

32:15.035 --> 32:16.302
This is what I am.

32:16.336 --> 32:20.607
I'm a D.A.
I can't --

32:20.641 --> 32:22.576
If I start letting
defendants scare me,

32:22.609 --> 32:25.245
what am I?

32:25.278 --> 32:28.549
I guess you'd be human.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.553
I'm fine.

32:32.586 --> 32:35.088
I'm prepared, and I'm ready.

33:26.306 --> 33:27.708
When my client heard

33:27.741 --> 33:29.676
that the police wanted
to talk to him,

33:29.710 --> 33:32.613
he voluntarily
went to the precinct.

33:32.646 --> 33:36.282
What he expected to find
was a police department

33:36.316 --> 33:39.085
interested in discovering
the truth.

33:39.119 --> 33:41.387
Instead, he found
frustrated detectives

33:41.421 --> 33:42.623
so angry
that they couldn't solve

33:42.656 --> 33:44.625
two high-profile homicides,

33:44.658 --> 33:46.326
that they were willing
to arrest him

33:46.359 --> 33:49.596
and hope that the charges
would stick.

33:49.630 --> 33:52.566
They searched his house,
his bar,

33:52.599 --> 33:54.835
and they couldn't
come up with one shred

33:54.868 --> 33:57.838
of physical evidence to connect
my client to this crime --

33:57.871 --> 34:01.675
No murder weapon,
no fingerprints,

34:01.708 --> 34:04.344
not on the shell casings
recovered at the scene,

34:04.377 --> 34:06.580
not on the cars
that were parked on the street.

34:06.613 --> 34:09.349
Nothing to prove that my client
has ever owned a gun

34:09.382 --> 34:11.851
or even held a gun,

34:11.885 --> 34:15.155
let alone used one
to commit a double murder.

34:15.188 --> 34:16.857
Nothing to prove
that he was even

34:16.889 --> 34:19.626
in the neighborhood
at the time of the shooting.

34:19.659 --> 34:21.360
Nothing to suggest
that my client

34:21.393 --> 34:24.598
even knew Michael Biggs.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.668
Mr. Bay has built
his entire case

34:27.701 --> 34:29.268
on the word of a witness

34:29.302 --> 34:31.605
who admits he was sleeping

34:31.638 --> 34:33.139
when this happened --

34:33.172 --> 34:34.741
A witness who is
as unbelievable

34:34.775 --> 34:37.678
as he is irresponsible,

34:37.710 --> 34:40.213
a witness who should have been
doing his job,

34:40.246 --> 34:41.815
but instead fell asleep
in his car

34:41.848 --> 34:43.617
in the middle of the day.

34:43.650 --> 34:46.186
He woke up
because he heard shots.

34:46.219 --> 34:49.455
He was groggy. He struggled
to get his bearings,

34:49.489 --> 34:51.257
and when he saw
it was a shooting,

34:51.291 --> 34:53.193
he ducked down.
It's human instinct.

34:53.226 --> 34:55.696
When you hear gunshots,
your first thought

34:55.728 --> 34:57.731
is to protect yourself.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.333
And Mr. Ross admitted
he only saw the shooter

35:00.366 --> 35:01.768
from the side,

35:01.802 --> 35:04.404
from a distance
of 60 feet,

35:04.437 --> 35:06.707
through tinted windows

35:06.740 --> 35:10.544
for a total
of a few seconds at most.

35:10.577 --> 35:14.314
Beyond reasonable doubt?

35:14.347 --> 35:16.650
Not even close.

35:37.403 --> 35:39.606
When you become
a prosecutor,

35:39.640 --> 35:44.210
your supervisors give you
one basic piece of advice --

35:44.244 --> 35:46.479
Keep it simple.

35:46.513 --> 35:48.381
Focus on the facts.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.717
Forget the distractions.

35:50.751 --> 35:53.820
Keep your eye on the truth.

35:53.854 --> 35:56.356
Be willing to stand up
for what's right,

35:56.389 --> 35:58.491
whatever the cost.

35:58.525 --> 36:02.462
Mr. Donnell says our case
comes down to one witness.

36:02.495 --> 36:05.899
Simply put, he's right.

36:05.932 --> 36:07.801
If you believe Mr. Ross,

36:07.834 --> 36:11.237
you must convict the defendant,

36:11.271 --> 36:14.274
and you should
believe Mr. Ross,

36:14.307 --> 36:17.210
because he had a front-row seat
for these murders.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.879
He was sitting
at street level

36:18.912 --> 36:21.548
with the best possible view
of the shooter.

36:21.582 --> 36:24.284
It was day. The lighting
couldn't have been better.

36:24.317 --> 36:25.686
He saw the defendant,

36:25.719 --> 36:28.454
but the defendant
couldn't see him --

36:28.488 --> 36:30.691
Didn't even know
he was there,

36:30.724 --> 36:33.960
which probably saved
Mr. Ross's life.

36:33.994 --> 36:37.598
Mr. Donnell has the gall
to suggest

36:37.631 --> 36:39.633
that Mr. Ross
was irresponsible

36:39.666 --> 36:42.268
for taking a nap.

36:42.302 --> 36:44.938
Mr. Ross did
the responsible thing

36:44.971 --> 36:48.408
by coming forward
immediately after the shooting.

36:48.441 --> 36:49.876
His description
of the shooter

36:49.910 --> 36:52.513
matched the defendant
perfectly.

36:52.546 --> 36:56.416
He had the courage
to come into this room,

36:56.449 --> 36:58.852
swear to tell the truth

36:58.885 --> 37:00.854
and identify the defendant

37:00.887 --> 37:03.590
as the man he saw that day.

37:03.624 --> 37:06.459
And no matter how hard
Mr. Donnell tried,

37:06.492 --> 37:09.730
he couldn't shake
that testimony.

37:09.763 --> 37:14.935
Mr. Ross is absolutely sure
the killer is this man.

37:14.968 --> 37:17.871
This man right here.

37:17.904 --> 37:21.608
And let me make this simple.
Two men are dead.

37:21.642 --> 37:23.977
Mr. Cahill is so brazen,

37:24.010 --> 37:27.814
so cold-blooded,

37:27.848 --> 37:30.016
he killed them
in broad daylight

37:30.050 --> 37:32.753
because he thought
no one would dare stop him,

37:32.786 --> 37:35.622
nobody would have the guts
to come forward,

37:35.656 --> 37:40.326
to prosecute him, to look him
in the eye and say it.

37:43.063 --> 37:45.465
You're a killer.

37:45.498 --> 37:47.634
You're a coward,

37:47.668 --> 37:49.369
and thanks to the jury,

37:49.402 --> 37:52.906
you're about to get
what you deserve.

37:57.678 --> 38:01.915
Believe Mr. Ross
and convict this man.

38:01.948 --> 38:04.751
He thinks he's untouchable.

38:04.785 --> 38:09.890
Prove to him he's wrong.

38:26.106 --> 38:28.809
You do this long enough,
you think you've seen it all.

38:28.842 --> 38:30.744
He actually threatened him
in the room?

38:30.777 --> 38:33.346
Right after basically
threatening to rape Helen.

38:33.379 --> 38:34.815
And they're not
filing charges?

38:34.848 --> 38:36.416
-Not so far.
-Did it work?

38:36.449 --> 38:38.752
-Was Bay nervous?
-He seemed to close okay.

38:38.785 --> 38:40.654
I thought he closed
better than usual.

38:40.687 --> 38:42.823
Hey, when's the last time
she ate?

38:42.856 --> 38:44.124
Around 5:00,

38:44.157 --> 38:46.993
but she puked
most of it on Eugene.

38:47.027 --> 38:48.829
Sorry.

38:48.862 --> 38:50.496
-You ready?
-All set?

38:50.531 --> 38:51.965
The sitter's at home.

38:51.998 --> 38:53.634
I actually get to go
out to a restaurant tonight.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.101
(telephone rings)

38:55.135 --> 38:58.972
Donnell, Dole,
et cetera.

38:59.005 --> 39:02.108
Yeah. Thank you.

39:02.142 --> 39:03.577
Verdict.

39:03.610 --> 39:06.747
Already?

39:27.768 --> 39:29.836
Will the defendant
please rise?

39:31.905 --> 39:34.908
Madame foreperson,
has the jury reached a verdict?

39:34.941 --> 39:36.877
We have, your honor.

39:36.910 --> 39:38.078
What say you?

39:38.111 --> 39:40.914
"Commonwealth versus
Jackson Cahill --

39:40.947 --> 39:43.917
"On the first count
of murder in the first degree,

39:43.950 --> 39:47.721
"We find the defendant
Jackson Cahill

39:47.754 --> 39:49.089
"Guilty.

39:49.122 --> 39:52.492
"On the second count,
murder in the first degree,

39:52.526 --> 39:56.129
"We find the defendant
Jackson Cahill...

39:56.162 --> 39:57.764
Guilty."

39:57.798 --> 40:01.635
Officers, take the defendant
back into custody.

40:01.668 --> 40:03.469
I'll schedule
sentencing later.

40:03.504 --> 40:06.139
Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

40:06.172 --> 40:08.942
You are dismissed
with the thanks of the court.

40:08.975 --> 40:11.645
Adjourned.

40:11.678 --> 40:15.549
Bobby, can you start
working on my appeal, please?

40:15.582 --> 40:19.052
Jackie, I think you need
to get yourself another lawyer.

40:42.909 --> 40:44.645
I'm fine.

40:44.678 --> 40:46.747
I sweat by nature, okay?

40:46.780 --> 40:48.148
Do you want to keep
the security?

40:48.181 --> 40:49.950
Should I?

40:49.983 --> 40:51.251
Well, he's got
nothing to gain now.

40:51.284 --> 40:52.853
Threatening you
can't do him any good.

40:52.886 --> 40:54.454
Unless he just
gets off on it.

41:04.264 --> 41:05.932
Why don't I
get the guards back?

41:05.966 --> 41:08.268
No, I don't want
to let him win.

41:08.301 --> 41:10.003
Just keep the security
for a week.

41:10.036 --> 41:11.905
I'll push them upstairs
to pay for it.

41:11.938 --> 41:15.542
No, I'm fine.
I really am.

41:15.576 --> 41:17.243
I'm right over there.

41:17.277 --> 41:20.213
-Where are you?
-Up a level.

41:20.246 --> 41:22.082
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Fine.

41:22.115 --> 41:24.017
Okay.
Congratulations, Richard.

41:24.050 --> 41:25.752
-You tried a great case.
-Thanks.

41:25.786 --> 41:27.988
Call me if you need
any company.

41:38.999 --> 41:41.702
Are you leaving?

41:44.070 --> 41:45.706
Yes.

41:45.739 --> 41:48.274
Good.

41:48.308 --> 41:50.611
Not too jumpy --
She's 80.

42:45.666 --> 42:47.768
â™ª (theme)

43:11.391 --> 43:12.993
You stinker!
