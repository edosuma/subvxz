00:04.046 --> 00:06.702
Hi, Shelby. Uh, it's Organizm.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.356
Happy anniversary.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
Your boyfriend Colin Waters
loves you,

00:10.401 --> 00:12.708
and I still think
you're a good player.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.364
EMMA:
Look, I feel bad.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.887
I would normally have Org
just spend time at my place

00:18.018 --> 00:19.584
instead of being cooped up
with Creamcheese,

00:19.715 --> 00:21.151
but with everything going on,
I feel like my dad

00:21.282 --> 00:22.457
just needs a little space.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.549
Hi, Todd, your friends say
you suck at League.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.551
That sucks.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.987
I still think
you're a good player.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.382
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Cameos.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.775
-I just made $250 right there.
-Oh, great.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.473
Well, can you not right now?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.388
'Cause I'm trying
to concentrate.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.042
KYLE:
Look, I'm not expecting them

00:42.172 --> 00:43.347
to become best friends
all of a sudden.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.740
I'm just hoping
that they'll learn

00:44.870 --> 00:46.611
to respect each other.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.874
-Happy tenth birthday. Ten...
-Yeah, happy tenth birthday.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.660
Hope your dog dies,
you little bitch.

00:51.790 --> 00:54.184
Bro, what the fuck?

00:54.315 --> 00:55.968
Can you delete that, actually?
That was mean.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.884
And, like, if they know you,
they probably know me, so...

00:59.015 --> 01:00.495
Oh, shit, a queue popped up.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.801
Okay, you go Varus,
I'm gonna go Nautilus.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.892
Maybe they'll push
each other to practice harder.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.721
Dude, I'm gonna head upstairs.
We should get some sleep.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.289
Org, bro, look, we got to sleep.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.815
KYLE: I figured, you know,
I-I can track their stats,

01:16.946 --> 01:20.384
so why don't I just put their
OP.GG on the scrim room TV?

01:20.515 --> 01:23.300
It's a constant reminder
of who's grinding harder.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.693
See what they do with that.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.435
Oh, my God.
[exhales]

01:29.480 --> 01:33.832
ORGANIZM: I mean, it's easier
for me to stay up longer.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.314
But you know,
that's-that's not his fault.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.621
He is, like, 27, so...

01:39.751 --> 01:43.755
It just happens, I guess,
with age, to people like him.

01:43.886 --> 01:47.237
Dude, can you not click
so fucking loud?

01:47.368 --> 01:48.673
Oh, my God.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.241
You don't do more damage
if you click harder.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.070
Cream is a really,
really great player,

01:54.201 --> 01:56.027
but what I found out
is that he just needs people

01:56.158 --> 01:57.726
to feed his ego

01:57.856 --> 01:59.728
and, you know, hype him up.

01:59.858 --> 02:02.296
Uh, that's just not me.

02:02.426 --> 02:05.125
Is that why you get
so many views on Twitch?

02:06.256 --> 02:08.737
It's like ASMR
for serial killers.

02:08.866 --> 02:12.741
I feel like I did a pretty good
job, like, you know,

02:12.871 --> 02:15.222
putting up with Organizm's
bullshit during the season.

02:15.352 --> 02:18.268
But back when I had
Frugger around,

02:18.399 --> 02:21.097
I could, like, lean on him
when shit got rough.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.056
PAUL:
Hey, everybody, uh, BigNPaul,

02:24.187 --> 02:26.189
general manager
of Fugitive Gaming.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.322
I'm excited to share
some news with you all

02:28.452 --> 02:30.802
ahead of the upcoming
LCS Summer Split.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.500
We are thrilled to announce

02:32.630 --> 02:34.154
the acquisition
of top laner Tyrant,

02:34.284 --> 02:36.939
uh, who will be joining
Fugitive Gaming.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.942
We think he's a-a great fit
with the team.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.509
With the trade,
we are saying goodbye

02:41.639 --> 02:43.641
to BGOLBKTOFWTR and Frugger,

02:43.772 --> 02:45.426
but we would like
to thank both of them

02:45.555 --> 02:47.819
for their amazing contributions
to the franchise

02:47.950 --> 02:49.691
both on and off the Rift.

02:49.821 --> 02:50.909
They will be missed.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.219
KYLE: You know, you spend
a lot of time with people.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.831
And they become parts
of the family.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.269
As a coach, you're always
looking for opportunities,

03:02.399 --> 03:04.445
you know, make decisions
that are right

03:04.575 --> 03:07.926
for, uh, the family.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.757
And in this case, it was, uh,

03:12.888 --> 03:14.368
getting rid of Frugger
and Bucket,

03:14.498 --> 03:16.500
because we wanted to upgrade
our topside

03:16.631 --> 03:19.286
and-and commit to a Creamcheese
and Organizm bot lane.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.201
NIGHTFALL:
Yeah, I don't know

03:21.331 --> 03:23.681
if I will miss Bucket,
to be honest.

03:23.812 --> 03:26.423
He had a really bad smell,
like, you know, old potato?

03:26.554 --> 03:30.775
But Frugger,
I'm definitely gonna miss him.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.474
Look, this-this team
has had to endure

03:33.603 --> 03:36.303
some pretty
significant departures.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.653
And, you know,
change is hard for all of us,

03:38.783 --> 03:41.395
but I think it's especially hard
for Creamcheese.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.572
CREAMCHEESE:
Trading Frugger is tough,

03:44.702 --> 03:45.964
you know?

03:47.009 --> 03:48.837
They say you don't
really miss someone

03:48.966 --> 03:51.405
until they're gone.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.190
That is just so true.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.498
Oh, no, Frugger, he slipped on
his banana peel and now he died.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.109
Frugger, don't fucking laugh!
Stop laughing.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.937
Like in spring, I had two goals:

04:02.067 --> 04:04.896
to get Frugger back on
the starting lineup and to win,

04:05.027 --> 04:07.421

that's something you'd just

06:41.705 --> 06:44.186
your insane accomplishments

o-of Cream's bashing to another.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.795
Let's hash it out.

08:56.187 --> 08:58.102
No, it's a super sick spot
for parties.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.322
I mean, the neighbors
absolutely hate it.

09:00.452 --> 09:01.584
We should grab a photo
for socials.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.151
-Oh.
-Crump?

09:03.281 --> 09:04.456
CRUMPET:
All right, here we go.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.763
-Three, two...
-RUDY JR.: Okay.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.418
CRUMPET:
Let's get one more.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.289
GURU: Welcome to theNeverLost
Podcast, winners.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.901
It's your boy Guru
back at you again

09:14.031 --> 09:16.425
with a huge episode.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.122
Holy shit.

09:18.253 --> 09:20.168
-Holy shit.
-My nemesis.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.909
Org, welcome to the show.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.217
No. No.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.611
I did not see that.

09:28.742 --> 09:31.266
Out of principle,
I would not waste

09:31.396 --> 09:33.442
one second of my life
watching Guru.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.446
He's a gargantuan piece
of human shit.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.926
Like, look at this shit.
You'll love this.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.667
-Oh, here we go.
-This is why the best

09:40.797 --> 09:41.972
can fuck with the best,
'cause check this shit out.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.713
This is just for you in studio.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.323
Check this out.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.022
"I still think
you're a good player."

09:48.152 --> 09:49.414
-You got that shit? Ah, ah, ah.
-Come on, bro!

09:52.287 --> 09:54.376
GURU: Yeah! I don't know
if we make it in your size...

10:02.079 --> 10:03.167
N-Not really.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.127
I don't know. I just, I...

10:06.257 --> 10:08.564
I don't feel like
they respect me, so...

10:08.695 --> 10:10.958
I was gonna do
what I was gonna do.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.787
Let's talk on
our old friend Creamcheese.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.223
He blames you...

10:15.353 --> 10:19.053
-Mm-hmm.
-...for missing the MSS.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.272
He said, "Thank you

10:21.403 --> 10:23.579
for the vacation"
to Organizm.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.929
You should not accept that
for a second,

10:26.060 --> 10:27.365
'cause I watched that game.
I did.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.976
I-It's on Creamcheese.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.761
-He wasn't playing Support.
-CRUMPET: No.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.111
GURU: I think
what Creamcheese needs...

10:34.242 --> 10:36.157
He's-he's not that good,

10:36.287 --> 10:38.072
so it-- we're just saying
facts-- he's not that good.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.988
I think he needs
a vote of confidence.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.554
-Yeah.
-From his teammates.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.774
-Yeah. Some encouragement.
-Right?

10:44.905 --> 10:47.734
GURU: Look, I t-think
you should say it.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.823
Do you think, you think he's...?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.086
Right? Like, don't you think
he's, like, a good,

10:52.216 --> 10:53.478
he's a good player?

10:53.609 --> 10:56.481
Okay. Um...

10:57.700 --> 10:59.833
It's okay, Creamcheese.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.791
I still think
you're a good player.

11:01.922 --> 11:05.012
-Oh! [laughs]
-Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.231
-[grunting]
-[laughter]

11:07.362 --> 11:10.495
Is this on Kyle's couch?
No way!

11:10.626 --> 11:12.410
"I still think..."
Did you hear that?

11:12.541 --> 11:14.586
Did you hear that, Cream?
Holy shit.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.110
"I still think
you're a good player, Cream."

11:16.240 --> 11:18.112
-CRUMPET: Oh, my God.
-Holy shit.

11:18.242 --> 11:19.722
That-that's the shirt we're

11:19.853 --> 11:21.158
-gonna send him. We're gonna...
-Don't worry!

11:21.289 --> 11:24.640
GURU: Even though you completely
fucked the MSS,

11:24.771 --> 11:26.860
your boy Org still thinks
you're a good player.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.210
I'm gonna send you a shirt.
We have an extra shirt, right?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.168
Do we have a shirt
in a ladies' small?

11:31.299 --> 11:32.735
Oh, boy...

11:32.866 --> 11:35.564
I know it was
just a joke on a podcast, um,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.175
but it-it felt personal.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.569
Organizm doing that podcast

11:40.700 --> 11:43.137
reopened a wound
that had never healed.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.790
You have to understand,
Guru didn't just

11:44.921 --> 11:46.488
walk away from Fugitive Gaming,

11:46.618 --> 11:49.230
he completely screwed over
the team.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.665
GURU:
Don't worry, Cream,

11:50.797 --> 11:52.450
-I still think you suck.
-[laughter]

11:52.581 --> 11:54.714
You suck. "I still think
you're a good player."

11:54.844 --> 11:56.716
CREAMCHEESE: If Organizm wants
to slap his team

11:56.846 --> 11:58.718
in the face, that's fine.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.371
It honestly just shows me

12:00.502 --> 12:02.896
what little respect
he has for Fugitive.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.680
He doesn't give a fuck.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.900
He knows exactly
what Guru did to us.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.907
♪ ♪

12:17.214 --> 12:18.476
APRIL: It's okay, we're still
in it, we're still in it.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.609
-We got it.
-GURU: Fight.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.003
GURU:
Fight for it. Fight for it.

-Fuck! Fuck!
-Yes! Yes.

-Thank you, fucking God!
-We're fucking millionaires.

12:26.963 --> 12:29.313
-You fucking god.
-We are fucking millionaires.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.186
We decided to sell
our team to Resnick.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.535
We are not millionaires!

12:33.665 --> 12:35.145
-We're splitting the money.
-No...

12:35.276 --> 12:36.451
Do you know how
pooling money works?

12:36.581 --> 12:37.800
Get over yourself.

12:37.931 --> 12:38.845
KYLE:
And there were definitely

12:38.975 --> 12:40.585
mixed feelings about that.

12:40.716 --> 12:43.066
We are worth so much more.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.460
Why would you take
the first offer, is my point.

12:45.590 --> 12:48.289
Guru was, uh,
the most vocal opponent

12:48.419 --> 12:50.073
against, uh, selling our team.

12:50.204 --> 12:52.293
And Cream
and fucking, uh, Foresite,

12:52.423 --> 12:55.035
they're just ready to take,
they're ready to sell now.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.211
By the time
the LCS season started,

12:57.341 --> 12:59.213
uh, you know,
a couple months had passed,

12:59.343 --> 13:01.563
and-and we really felt like, uh,

13:01.693 --> 13:03.086
that was all behind us.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.435
I mean, we were an LCS team.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.483
RIVINGTON: Welcome to
the opening game of the 2016

13:08.613 --> 13:11.181
North American Championship
Series Spring Split.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.575
We are here today
to watch Fugitive Gaming

13:13.705 --> 13:16.099
take to the LCS
for the first time

13:16.230 --> 13:19.320
after quite a run
through the Challenger Series.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.669
Jatt, they have
so much to offer,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.976
and they go up against
Cloud9 today

13:23.106 --> 13:24.673
in what is going to be
an intense match.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.283
[cheering]

13:26.414 --> 13:27.284
RIVINGTON: Looking to gain
the advantage fast,

13:27.415 --> 13:28.590
to gain top lane,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.244
Guru grabs first blood.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.549
Welcome to the LCS

13:31.680 --> 13:32.855
with your first kill!

13:34.161 --> 13:36.424
JATT: You wouldn't be able
to tell between these two teams

13:36.554 --> 13:39.862
that Fugitive is the one
playing their first LCS match.

13:39.993 --> 13:43.170
FORESITE: That first game
in the LCS was...

13:43.300 --> 13:45.520
I mean, it's a dream
come true, right?

13:45.650 --> 13:48.001
RIVINGTON: That's gonna be
enough to open up the fight.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.915
This is everything
Fugitive needed.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.526
-Oh, you can't touch me, baby.
-Just last fight, last fight.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.528
-Go, go, go, go...
-[whoops]

13:53.658 --> 13:56.487
FORESITE:
And Guru, for the whole time

13:56.618 --> 13:59.316
that we were scrimming together,
he was excited.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.883
Oh, Guru, you are a god.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.624
Go, go, go. Follow,
follow him. Follow him.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.845
FORESITE: I mean, yes,
he was streaming a lot,

14:05.975 --> 14:07.934
he would be out
at parties a lot,

14:08.064 --> 14:11.024
but I never questioned
his loyalty to the team.

14:11.154 --> 14:13.330
JATT: Fugitive take
their first Nexus turrets,

14:13.461 --> 14:16.333
their first Nexus
and their first ever LCS win.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.640

A fucking...

14:26.300 --> 14:27.867
RIVINGTON: If this is what
to expect from them,

14:27.997 --> 14:29.259
we've got a fun split
ahead of us.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.392
-Yeah!
-[indistinct chatter]

14:31.522 --> 14:33.263
CREAMCHEESE:
Yeah, in his first LCS game,

14:33.394 --> 14:34.743
Guru played great.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.179
Honestly,

14:36.310 --> 14:37.485
I've never wished this before,

14:37.615 --> 14:38.616
I wish we lost that game.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.140
[cheering, applause]

14:40.270 --> 14:41.968
You know,
it-it just felt great to win.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.970
It was-was, like,
walking in there and knowing

14:44.100 --> 14:45.623
you're just fulfilling
your destiny.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.582
And it felt great to win.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.454
And I had this moment
of clarity during the game

14:50.585 --> 14:53.762
where I-I realized that I had
accomplished everything

14:53.893 --> 14:57.505
that I wanted
in my LCS pro career.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.595
That's why today
I'm announcing that, uh, I am...

15:00.725 --> 15:02.075
I'm leaving Fugitive,

15:02.205 --> 15:03.293
and I am retiring

15:03.424 --> 15:05.165
-from pro gaming.
-[laughter]

15:05.295 --> 15:09.082
I mean, it's been a long career
in-in the past 36 minutes.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.388
I've made, I've made so many
friends and so many memories,

15:11.519 --> 15:15.044
so many ups and downs,
and, uh, I-I just hit a ceiling

15:15.175 --> 15:18.134
and-and I realized what I want
to do and what my purpose is.

15:18.265 --> 15:21.877
And that is to start
my lifestyle collective.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.226

Will you hold this
for one second?

15:25.663 --> 15:27.404
-Wait.
-GURU: It's NeverLost, guys.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.189
It's NeverLost. W-- Hold it
so it's closer to me.

-It's NeverLost, guys.
-[audience booing]

15:30.930 --> 15:32.540
CRUMPET: It was the best
retirement speech

15:32.670 --> 15:34.759
of all time.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.240
Because you will never
experience what it is to lose

15:37.371 --> 15:38.981
-an LCS game.
-GURU: I want to see

15:39.112 --> 15:40.243
a before-and-after photo of me,

15:40.374 --> 15:41.941
of, like, when I started
my LCS career

15:42.071 --> 15:43.333
-till now, like, right now,
-To, like, right now.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.813
It's just the same photo.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.162
Your hair looks exactly
the same and everything.

15:46.293 --> 15:48.556
Exactly the same, still perfect.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.951
FORESITE:
Guru stayed on the team

15:52.081 --> 15:55.606
for the whole off-season
just to play one game.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.695
All to plug his channel.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.482
CREAMCHEESE: Every night after
we were done scrimming,

16:01.612 --> 16:04.093
he must have
been going off and, like,

16:04.224 --> 16:05.965
making logos and shit.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.881
And buying sweatshirts
and ordering apparel

16:10.012 --> 16:12.362
and, like, setting up
podcast guests.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.974
It felt insane, uh,
stepping on the stage

16:15.104 --> 16:16.497
and-and grabbing that mic,

16:16.627 --> 16:18.325
-but it also felt right.
-Oh, yeah.

16:18.455 --> 16:20.414
To my teammates, thank you
for-for, for playing with me.

16:20.544 --> 16:23.895
Um, enjoy your sponsors,
Nathan's private jet.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.767
-I hope that works out.
-This real, dude?

16:25.897 --> 16:27.856
Like, best of luck with all
the scrims. PuttPutt, you're...

16:27.987 --> 16:30.511
CREAMCHEESE:
To call it "NeverLost"

16:30.641 --> 16:32.600
after winning one game?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.341
Thank you so much. Thank you.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.386
NeverLost, NeverLost!

16:36.517 --> 16:38.867
CREAMCHEESE:
I mean, who would watch that?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.869
Honestly, we all thought
that was gonna be

16:41.000 --> 16:42.958
the silver lining
of all of this, of watching

16:43.089 --> 16:45.265
his dreams explode in his face.

16:45.395 --> 16:48.746
NeverLost Podcast
in the building.

16:48.877 --> 16:52.359
Obviously, it didn't
happen exactly that way.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.926
What up, winners?
We have a very special giveaway.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.494
I am giving away
brand-new merch...

16:57.625 --> 16:59.018
APRIL:
Almost instantly,

16:59.148 --> 17:00.845
it was one of the biggest brands
in all of gaming.

17:00.976 --> 17:04.109
Just two grown men
in a tiny tub.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.721
PAUL: Guru created
a brand with NeverLost

17:06.851 --> 17:09.506
that really brought gaming
into the mainstream culture.

17:09.637 --> 17:13.380
KYLE: Guru took a big gamble
creating a gaming brand,

17:13.510 --> 17:15.904
but y-- I mean,
he did it, you know?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.906
H-He forged his own way.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.516
CREAMCHEESE:
He would do this,

17:19.646 --> 17:23.520
like, f-- very forced
performative philanthropy.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.131
Like, I know he doesn't read.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.611
Literacy
is super important to me.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.440
It helps me understand
the human condition.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.703
And I don't hate Guru for that.
He's a businessman.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.054
He's rich as hell, he's
figured out what he's doing.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.273
I hate Guru
'cause he's a douche.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.015
And he used
to flex after victories.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.235
Which is funny
if you're not in shape,

17:42.365 --> 17:44.759
but he was in shape, so it was
kind of just, like, annoying.

17:44.889 --> 17:46.456
I don't want to see
Guru actually flex

17:46.587 --> 17:48.850
his actually kind of nice body.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.808
FRUGGER: I mean, in the span
of a few months,

17:50.939 --> 17:52.288
he had his own energy drink.

17:52.419 --> 17:53.898
It was fucking delicious.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.074
CHRIS:
But the one that really gets me

17:55.204 --> 17:56.945
is he had his own MasterClass.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.166
Something I've always said,
you have to turn your losses

18:00.296 --> 18:01.776
into wins.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.300
So in that way,
I have never lost.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.824
Over the course
of the next four hours,

18:06.955 --> 18:11.873
you and I are gonna figure out
exactly why that makes sense.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.527
I mean, I guess that's what
it's always been about for him,

18:13.657 --> 18:16.573
is making as much money
as you can make.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.576
He was willing to give up
his pro career for that.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.754
INDIANA: There's two ways
to make money in gaming.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.626
There's being a pro player
and there's being a streamer.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.932
There's being a competitor...

18:28.063 --> 18:29.586
First in purpose.
Go, go, go, go, go.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.153
...and there's being
an entertainer.

18:31.284 --> 18:35.114
Why not start the day
with a win? NeverLost.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.203
Now, the competitive element
comes with the integrity

18:37.333 --> 18:42.512
and the prestige of being the
best and chasing that trophy.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.949
The streaming entertainment
element comes with money

18:45.080 --> 18:46.647
and it comes with fame.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.388
NATHAN: Imagine if you could
strap a GoPro

18:48.518 --> 18:50.041
to LeBron James

18:50.172 --> 18:53.784
and watch his every single move
during practice.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.917
That's what streamers are doing.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.572
These are the best players
on the planet,

18:58.702 --> 19:00.617
and they're letting you
into their world,

19:00.748 --> 19:04.143
their strategy, and-and
in some cases, their lives.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.493
I've watched
my own daughter do it.

19:06.623 --> 19:07.668
Let's hear it for Emmanence.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.931
[applause]

19:10.061 --> 19:13.021
Uh, her fans are-- don't just
feel like they're fans of hers.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.718
They feel like
they're friends with her.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.111
EMMA:
What Guru did to Fugitive

19:16.242 --> 19:17.895
was a real dickhole move.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.810
But you can't dispute that
he revolutionized streaming.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.030
We are five minutes
into the game.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.075
I have already killed
this dude four times.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.381
PAUL:
A good way to look at streaming

19:25.512 --> 19:27.296
is that if the LCS is the NBA,

19:27.427 --> 19:29.080
then solo queue streaming

19:29.211 --> 19:30.908
is like pickup basketball,
right?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.780
But imagine a world

19:32.910 --> 19:34.999
where the very best
pickup basketball players

19:35.130 --> 19:37.872
can actually make as much
if not more money

19:38.002 --> 19:40.701
than the best NBA players,
and that's esports.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.182
And that's why Guru makes
more money than Foresite.

19:43.312 --> 19:45.575
That's why Organizm is getting
just as many sponsors

19:45.706 --> 19:48.970
and attention from streaming
as he is from the LCS.

19:49.100 --> 19:53.104
And Guru is one
of the pioneers of that model.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.473
You know, so far, our time

20:13.603 --> 20:15.344
with Fugitive has been
a little rocky.

20:15.475 --> 20:18.521
But my brother's still getting
some well-deserved attention.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.307
Organizm,

21:04.437 --> 21:06.090
At what age did you realize
playing League

21:06.221 --> 21:07.440
was something that you were
gonna pursue professionally?

21:07.570 --> 21:08.919

At what age did you--

Y-You have that written
down there? That's crazy.

-Okay. Excuse me, sorry.

21:39.472 --> 21:42.257
APRIL:
Popularity is a mixed blessing.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.085
The downside is it can be
a shot to the ego

for the rest of the players
when one member

21:46.609 --> 21:48.394
