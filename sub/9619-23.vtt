{\an1}THAT WASN'T HER STOMACH

01:38.865 --> 01:40.733
{\an1}LIKE TRUE'S FRIEND RYAN.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN'S AN INTERN?

01:42.735 --> 01:43.803

{\an1}I KNOW HE'S ON THE COMPANY

01:44.571 --> 01:45.638
{\an1}SOFTBALL TEAM.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.540
{\an1}AMANDA, BE A DEAR

01:47.607 --> 01:48.374
{\an1}AND GIVE HIM HIS TUESIE

01:48.441 --> 01:58.585
{\an1}WHEN YOU SEE HIM.

01:58.651 --> 01:59.285
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THINK THE NEW INTERN'S

02:01.855 --> 02:02.255
{\an1}THIS IS

02:02.322 --> 02:03.790
{\an1}A PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

02:03.857 --> 02:04.491
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO LUCK FINDING HIS PHOTO

02:04.557 --> 02:05.625
{\an1}ON THE INTERNET?

02:05.692 --> 02:07.427
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOPE.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.995
{\an1}BUT I DID FIND A PICTURE

02:09.062 --> 02:09.596
{\an1}OF A SPARROW

02:09.662 --> 02:10.797
{\an1}WITH AN ENTIRE TURKEY LEG

02:10.864 --> 02:14.000
{\an1}IN HIS MOUTH.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.101
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO, YOU'RE OKAY

02:15.168 --> 02:15.835
{\an1}WITH MR. MADIGAN

02:21.374 --> 02:22.208
{\an1}AREN'T YOU A LITTLE JEALOUS

02:22.275 --> 02:24.043
{\an1}THAT MR. M HAS A NEW DISCOVERY?

02:24.110 --> 02:25.111
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

02:25.178 --> 02:26.379
{\an1}I'M NOT THE JEALOUS TYPE.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.413
{\an1}BESIDES, IT'LL BE AWESOME

02:27.480 --> 02:28.014
{\an1}TO HAVE ANOTHER KID

02:28.081 --> 02:28.815
{\an1}IN THE OFFICE.

02:28.882 --> 02:29.582
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, LULU,

02:29.649 --> 02:30.216
{\an1}YOU GUYS ARE NEVER GOING

02:30.283 --> 02:33.353
{\an1}TO BELIE--

02:33.419 --> 02:34.354
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH, MAYBE ONE LESS KID

02:34.420 --> 02:34.821
{\an1}AROUND HERE

02:34.888 --> 02:37.724
{\an1}WOULDN'T BE THE WORST THING.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.859
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, WHOSE TOY CAR IS THIS?

02:39.926 --> 02:40.560
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOURS.

02:40.627 --> 02:41.227
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, WOULD YOU PLEASE

02:41.294 --> 02:41.995
{\an1}MAKE SURE I DON'T LEAVE IT

02:42.061 --> 02:44.998
{\an1}ON THE GROUND AGAIN.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.432
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN, WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.433
{\an1}YOU SEEM MORE HYSTERICAL

02:47.500 --> 02:48.535
{\an1}THAN USUAL.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.369
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE I HAD

02:49.435 --> 02:50.270
{\an1}THE CRAZIEST EXPERIENCE

02:50.336 --> 02:51.771
{\an1}THIS MORNING.

02:51.838 --> 02:56.476
{\an1}IT WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.143
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'LL FIND

02:57.210 --> 02:58.878
{\an1}THIS FINAL EXAM FAIR

02:58.945 --> 03:00.213
{\an1}BUT CHALLENGING.

03:00.280 --> 03:00.914
{\an1}IF YOU'VE PAID ATTENTION

03:00.980 --> 03:01.881
{\an1}ALL SEMESTER,

03:01.948 --> 03:03.416
{\an1}YOU SHOULD DO FINE.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.350
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FINAL EXAM?

03:04.417 --> 03:05.285
{\an1}BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN TO CLASS

03:05.351 --> 03:12.959
{\an1}ALL SEMESTER.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.429
{\an1}I CAN STILL HEAR THEIR LAUGHTER.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.397
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RYAN, RELAX, THAT'S ACTUALLY

03:17.463 --> 03:19.132
{\an1}A VERY COMMON NIGHTMARE.

03:19.198 --> 03:19.933
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T A NIGHTMARE.

03:19.999 --> 03:20.833
{\an1}IT JUST HAPPENED AN HOUR AGO

03:20.900 --> 03:23.436
{\an1}IN MR. MERRILL'S HISTORY CLASS.

03:23.503 --> 03:24.971
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN SUMMER SCHOOL?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.874
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M AS SURPRISED AS YOU ARE.

03:27.941 --> 03:28.741
{\an1}APPARENTLY, I WAS SUPPOSED

03:28.808 --> 03:29.676
{\an1}TO REPEAT U.S. HISTORY

03:29.742 --> 03:30.577
{\an1}OVER THE SUMMER.

03:30.643 --> 03:31.077
{\an1}AND ASIDE

03:31.144 --> 03:32.245
{\an1}FROM THE DAILY PHONE CALLS

03:32.312 --> 03:34.247
{\an1}TO MY HOUSE, NO ONE TOLD ME

03:34.314 --> 03:36.816
{\an1}ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.951
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, BUT WHY WERE YOU

03:38.017 --> 03:39.319
{\an1}IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

03:39.385 --> 03:42.121
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY PANTS WERE IN THE LAUNDRY.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.656
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ALL OF 'EM?

03:43.723 --> 03:44.457
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN ALL OF 'EM?

03:44.524 --> 03:45.158
{\an1}WHO NEEDS MORE THAN ONE PAIR

03:45.224 --> 03:47.594
{\an1}OF PANTS?

03:47.660 --> 03:50.096
{\an1}WHAT AM I, THE MAYOR?

03:50.163 --> 03:51.864
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SO, HOW'D YOU DO ON THE EXAM?

03:51.931 --> 03:52.732
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T TAKE IT.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.600
{\an1}I GOT MR. MERRILL TO AGREE

03:53.666 --> 03:54.434
{\an1}TO LET ME TAKE A MAKE-UP TEST

03:54.500 --> 03:56.002
{\an1}SO I'D HAVE A CHANCE TO STUDY.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.736
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S GOOD.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.470
{\an1}WHEN'S YOUR MAKE-UP?

03:57.537 --> 03:59.305
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TODAY AT 4:00.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.273
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SIX HOURS

04:00.340 --> 04:01.474
{\an1}TO LEARN AN ENTIRE SEMESTER

04:01.541 --> 04:02.342
{\an1}OF HISTORY?

04:02.408 --> 04:02.942
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YUP.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.277
{\an1}AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.278
{\an1}I HATE TO BE IN YOUR SHOES.

04:05.345 --> 04:05.645
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY?

04:05.712 --> 04:06.312
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING

04:06.379 --> 04:08.214
{\an1}TO TUTOR ME.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.082
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO WAY.

04:09.148 --> 04:09.983
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT WHY NOT?

04:10.049 --> 04:10.883
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I TUTORED YOU

04:10.950 --> 04:12.051
{\an1}LAST YEAR IN MATH.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.019
{\an1}IT WAS HORRIBLE.

04:13.086 --> 04:13.553
{\an1}YOU'RE THE MOST

04:13.620 --> 04:14.253
{\an1}EASILY DISTRACTED PERSON

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, SORRY,

04:28.301 --> 04:28.968
{\an1}I JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING

15:09.775 --> 15:10.376
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

15:10.442 --> 15:10.976
{\an1}MARCH DOWN TO FINIQUE

15:11.043 --> 15:11.777
{\an1}AND TELL MAX?

{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.546
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO?

15:14.613 --> 15:16.915
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TRUE, WHEN I WAS

15:16.982 --> 15:18.117
{\an1}IN FASHION SCHOOL,

15:18.183 --> 15:20.486
{\an1}MY BEST FRIEND WAS DIEGO TOVAR.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.320
{\an1}WE WERE BOTH FINALISTS

15:21.387 --> 15:21.854
{\an1}FOR THE YOUNG

{\an1}DESIGNERS' SHOWCASE.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.456
{\an1}TOVAR PRESENTED FIRST,

15:24.523 --> 15:25.991
{\an1}AND THE DRESS HE PRESENTED

15:26.058 --> 15:27.760
{\an1}WAS MY DESIGN.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.695
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH MY GOSH, WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.397
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DID WHAT ANYONE WOULD DO.

15:31.463 --> 15:31.897
{\an1}I TACKLED HIM,

15:31.964 --> 15:32.531
{\an1}YANKED OFF HIS TOUPEE

15:32.598 --> 15:33.065
{\an1}AND YELLED "THIEF"

15:33.132 --> 15:33.699
{\an1}UNTIL SECURITY FORCIBLY

15:33.766 --> 15:35.801
{\an1}REMOVED ME FROM THE BUILDING.

15:35.868 --> 15:36.935
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.

15:37.002 --> 15:37.636
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, HE DIDN'T WIN

15:37.703 --> 15:38.404
{\an1}THE SHOWCASE.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.607
{\an1}BUT WE WERE BOTH DISQUALIFIED.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.909
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:43.976 --> 15:44.943
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TAKE IT FROM ME,

15:45.010 --> 15:46.111
{\an1}A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE

15:46.178 --> 15:52.217
{\an1}AREN'T FAIR.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.124
{\an1}&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.025
{\an1}AT LEAST IT WORKED OUT FOR US

{\an1}SUPER GOOD FRIENDS.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.129
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S SO MUCH BETTER

16:04.196 --> 16:12.204
{\an1}THAN ACTUAL SUCCESS.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, RYAN,
