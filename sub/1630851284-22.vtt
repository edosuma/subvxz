09:57.097 --> 09:59.097
Why wait?

09:59.248 --> 10:01.248
Here you go, Simpson.

10:01.343 --> 10:03.993
-Best part of the job.
-(chuckles)

10:04.087 --> 10:05.178
You know it, Linda.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.938
Dad, is that your paycheck?

10:07.165 --> 10:08.756
Sure is.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.516
Can I see it?

10:10.669 --> 10:12.527
I'll do you one better.

10:18.526 --> 10:21.268
(hums happily)

10:21.288 --> 10:23.179
Give it to me in singles.

10:23.198 --> 10:26.625
Minus
the 8.5% check-cashing fee.

10:26.852 --> 10:29.127
I didn't ask
for your life story.

10:29.354 --> 10:32.947
And here's
what makes it all worthwhile.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.301
Whoa.
You get all that every week?

10:36.470 --> 10:38.970
Every<i> two</i> weeks.

10:39.898 --> 10:41.973
(laughing)

10:43.310 --> 10:46.227
Ah, the laugh of respect.

10:51.209 --> 10:52.817
Oh, my God, is it picture day?

10:52.969 --> 10:55.561
Lisa, quick,
let me fix your hair.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.805
Ow! It's not picture day,

10:57.899 --> 11:00.216
and my hair's not pasta.

11:00.218 --> 11:02.143
I am dressed this way
to honor Dad.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.496
I never thought about it,
but Homer makes enough

11:04.665 --> 11:06.906
to pay for this awesome crib,
two cars,

11:07.058 --> 11:09.150
with enough left over
to fill the freezer

11:09.227 --> 11:10.743
with three kinds
of french fries:

11:10.896 --> 11:14.080
waffle, curly and steak-cut.

11:14.232 --> 11:15.732
Dad, all these years

11:15.750 --> 11:18.418
I thought you were
just some uncool roommate

11:18.512 --> 11:19.752
that I got stuck with.

11:19.846 --> 11:23.740
Now I realize you're a winner.

11:23.758 --> 11:28.411
And that's why I want to be
a nuclear safety inspector.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.412
(sniffles)

11:29.505 --> 11:31.581
Marge, he doesn't
just respect me.

11:31.674 --> 11:33.024
He wants to<i> be</i> me.

11:33.176 --> 11:34.600
What a feeling.

11:34.695 --> 11:38.922
Oh... this must be
how LeBron feels about...

11:38.940 --> 11:41.090
(crying):
...Bronny.

11:41.109 --> 11:42.183
BOTH:
Mmm.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.035
Just like you, Dad, I can't wait

11:44.112 --> 11:45.519
to live the American dream.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.096
Well, actually...

11:47.115 --> 11:49.782
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.525
Pew, pew, pew!

11:51.619 --> 11:53.194
I'm a superstar spaceman.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.105
I'm a modern superhero.
I can fly,

11:56.199 --> 11:58.624
but I can't process
my own trauma.

11:58.777 --> 12:00.460
I'm a nuclear safety guy.

12:00.612 --> 12:02.870
I get tons of money
for not blowing the town up.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.206
Well, the thing about that is...

12:05.225 --> 12:07.967
-What?
-Nothing.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.062
-Forget I said anything.
-(groans)

12:12.640 --> 12:14.140
Hey, Dad, guess what.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.794
I made a homemade ID badge,
and Larry just waved me in.

12:17.963 --> 12:20.238
Huh. Where is he?

12:20.465 --> 12:22.365
(snoring)

12:25.746 --> 12:27.971
Oh, man, what a gig.

12:27.989 --> 12:29.230
Homer's got it made.

12:29.324 --> 12:31.249
JANITOR (chuckles):
He sure does.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.068
So, you're visiting your old man
at work today?

12:34.162 --> 12:36.070
I sure am. And this sweet job

12:36.164 --> 12:39.240
will be mine someday.

12:39.334 --> 12:40.333
Wha...?

12:40.427 --> 12:42.076
Hate to burst your bubble, kid,

12:42.245 --> 12:43.928
but the kind of job your dad has

12:44.080 --> 12:46.765
-just doesn't exist anymore.
-Why not?

12:46.916 --> 12:48.582
Well, there's no simple answer
to that.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.494
-All right. See you later.
-Bart, come with me
