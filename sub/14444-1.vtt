18:38.844 --> 18:42.056
He's a real smart ass, Lieutenant.

18:42.181 --> 18:46.060
Hi, boys. Who's in there?
J Edgar Hoover's in there?

18:46.185 --> 18:50.606
Sure. They're all peeping through.

18:50.731 --> 18:53.859
- With an E? You got an E on your name?
- Yeah.

18:53.984 --> 18:58.239
- That sounds like a fag name.
- Is that what you are?

18:58.364 --> 19:02.243
I'm a fag, but anybody called
Philip Marlowe has gotta be a fag.

19:02.368 --> 19:05.162
- Sounds like an Exeter Academy fag.
- Right, right.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.331
What are you here for, Marlowe?

19:07.456 --> 19:13.087
I'm getting ready for the big game
Saturday. We're playing Notre Dame.

19:13.212 --> 19:17.341
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I'm getting into my make-up.

19:17.466 --> 19:22.596
You got a banjo?
I'll do my Al Jolson routine.

19:22.721 --> 19:28.602
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm getting ready to sing "Swanee".

19:28.727 --> 19:31.397
- Sure, I get it. Al Jolson.
- He was OK.

19:31.522 --> 19:35.109
Damn right he was OK.
But what the hell are we doing here?

19:35.234 --> 19:38.362
- Just sweating.
- You don't tie in. This suit, the name.

19:38.487 --> 19:41.949
- What are you from, a prep school?
- It was a long time ago.

19:42.074 --> 19:45.744
- No, I never went to a prep school.
- No, you don't look like prep school.

19:45.870 --> 19:51.125
But that's not important. You'd better have
the right answers when Farmer gets here.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.462
Here's your man, Lieutenant.
A real cutie pie.

19:54.587 --> 19:59.467
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- You're looking very good. Sit down.

19:59.592 --> 20:04.764
We don't want you banged up. Somebody
might get the wrong impression.

20:04.889 --> 20:10.603
Tell me, Marlowe, why can't you
answer one simple question?

20:10.728 --> 20:14.523
I don't like the way you ask questions
and I don't know what you wanna know.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.109
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.

20:18.277 --> 20:20.321
He's the cutie pie, Lieutenant.

20:20.446 --> 20:23.407
You're the smart ass,
you little honky bastard.

20:23.532 --> 20:26.494
- I'll throw the book at you.
- What's the charges?

20:26.619 --> 20:28.662
Don't give me that innocent crap.

20:28.788 --> 20:31.624
You expect me to believe
that Terry Lennox showed up,

20:31.749 --> 20:34.585
you drove him someplace
and he didn't tell you?

20:34.710 --> 20:38.672
- That's what I've been telling you.
- You wanna hear the charges? OK.

20:38.798 --> 20:41.383
- Accessory after the fact of murder.
- Who's dead?

20:41.509 --> 20:44.220
- Aiding a felon in unlawful flight.
- Who's dead?

20:44.345 --> 20:48.015
Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead.

20:48.933 --> 20:50.976
And not a nice dead.

21:00.152 --> 21:03.531
- I don't believe it.
- She's dead. That's obvious.

21:03.656 --> 21:07.743
- So what don't you believe?
- That Terry Lennox could kill her.

21:07.868 --> 21:11.080
You don't believe
he could beat a woman to death?

21:11.205 --> 21:13.582
- How long have you known him?
- A long time.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.669
- What's that supposed to mean?
- A long time.

21:16.794 --> 21:19.630
- From college?
- I didn't go to college.

21:19.755 --> 21:23.509
So you didn't go to college.
What was his real name?

21:23.634 --> 21:26.804
- You guys know his real name.
- We know, but you tell me.

21:26.929 --> 21:31.350
Lenny Potts. It wasn't fancy
enough, so he changed it.

21:31.475 --> 21:33.310
Fancy?

21:33.436 --> 21:35.855
Fancy my ass!

21:35.980 --> 21:39.567
The man's a gambler, a hood,
thick as thieves with Marty Augustine.

21:39.692 --> 21:41.735
So what does that mean?

21:42.987 --> 21:45.573
He was always splitting
up with his wife.

21:45.698 --> 21:48.242
- He loved his wife.
- Was she cheating on him?

21:48.367 --> 21:50.411
Are you cheating on your wife?

21:50.536 --> 21:53.622
Maybe. But my wife's not dead.
Was he cheating on her?

21:53.747 --> 21:56.208
Is your wife cheating on you?

21:57.626 --> 22:03.048
How come you know so little about your
dear old pal? Or are you dummying up?

22:05.634 --> 22:07.762
Last night what did he tell you?

22:07.887 --> 22:12.057
That he was in a jam
with his gambling associates?

22:12.183 --> 22:14.769
That he was fighting
with his wife again?

22:14.894 --> 22:17.354
What excuse did he give you?

22:18.063 --> 22:21.358
The hell with it.
Take him out. Book him.

22:22.359 --> 22:24.945
- Fuck you!
- Stand in line, baby.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.114
Come on.

22:28.616 --> 22:31.285
While I was waiting
for my dog to come back,

22:31.410 --> 22:36.332
we just went in, we went to the
Saugus Cafe and decided to toss a few.

22:36.457 --> 22:39.376
We were getting out,
and I get in my car, I get my dog,

22:39.502 --> 22:41.670
and we're riding down Lankershim...

22:41.796 --> 22:45.549
There are more cops on
Lankershim Boulevard than in this place.

22:45.674 --> 22:52.014
So I go down, I see the red lights behind
me and I figure: OK. So I pull over.

22:52.139 --> 22:56.060
- Cat comes up to the car and he says...
- OK, Marlowe. On your feet.

22:56.185 --> 22:58.938
- Keep it clean, Socrates.
- Great. Thanks a lot.

22:59.063 --> 23:00.689
So, anyway...

23:00.815 --> 23:03.943
Get dressed, Marlowe.
You're not coming back.

23:04.068 --> 23:06.862
- Know what they got in here now?
- It's about time.

23:06.987 --> 23:11.367
- They got people that smoke marijuana.
- Aren't you afraid your lips will fall off?

23:11.492 --> 23:18.541
Possession's what you get in here for.
Possession of noses, of gonads, of life.

23:18.666 --> 23:23.629
Someday all the pigs are gonna be in here
and all the people are gonna be out there.

23:23.754 --> 23:29.093
You can bet on that. You're not in here. It's
just your body. See you when you get out.

23:29.218 --> 23:31.720
- Hands on the counter.
- But I already...

23:31.846 --> 23:34.390
- Philip Marlowe, over here.
- What's going on?

23:34.515 --> 23:37.435
- Sign the card.
- What is going on, please?

23:37.560 --> 23:40.479
- You're free.
- I was free to begin with.

23:40.604 --> 23:45.276
Is anybody gonna explain why my ass
has been in there for three days?

23:45.401 --> 23:50.072
Could you tell me something?
Is Lieutenant Farmer around?

23:51.115 --> 23:55.828
Wait a second. Farmer. They're just now
letting me free. I appreciate that.

23:55.953 --> 23:58.706
Could you explain to me
what's happening?

23:58.831 --> 24:00.875
We don't have any further use for you.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.461
I know that,
but did you drop the charges?

24:03.586 --> 24:06.964
- Now we got all our answers.
- What happened?

24:07.089 --> 24:10.050
Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe.
The case is closed.

24:10.176 --> 24:13.471
What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead?

24:39.497 --> 24:42.082
You're not gonna find anything in that.

24:42.208 --> 24:46.045

What'd they pick you up for?

24:46.170 --> 24:49.381
I heard they were springing you.
Got a way to get home?

24:49.507 --> 24:54.053
No. These mothers bring you here but
they don't care about how you get back.

24:54.178 --> 24:58.516
I'll give you a lift home. There's a few
back issues you might be interested in.

25:02.228 --> 25:05.815
Blew his brains out
in a little godforsaken town in Mexico.

25:05.940 --> 25:09.860
- He left a full confession.
- I'm reading it. Don't describe it to me too.

25:09.985 --> 25:13.030
- I'm sorry, Marlowe.
- What are you sorry about?

25:13.155 --> 25:16.283
- It's just another story to you.
- Sorry you're so stupid.

25:16.408 --> 25:20.830
There you are sitting in the poky, taking
lumps for a friend, and he lets you down.

25:20.955 --> 25:23.707
- That's my problem.
- Stupid, Marlowe.

25:23.833 --> 25:27.878

- Yeah, I see.

25:35.344 --> 25:38.889
Why kill himself in Otatoclan?
He could have done it in Tijuana.

25:39.014 --> 25:42.518
Man at the end of his rope. Never know
what the hell they're gonna do.

25:42.643 --> 25:45.187
What happened to his body?

25:45.312 --> 25:50.109
His wife's family didn't want any
part of it. For obvious reasons.

25:50.234 --> 25:55.656
Doesn't have any family of his own.
So he's buried in Otatoclan.

25:55.781 --> 26:00.911
Yeah, I get the picture. Case closed,
all zippered up like a big bag of shit.

26:01.036 --> 26:03.080
Terry wasn't at the end of his rope.

26:03.205 --> 26:06.000
The way he talked,
Sylvia wasn't dead then either.

26:06.125 --> 26:11.005

- Everybody else does.

- Got a new line of sandwiches in.

Yes. My husband has a drinking problem.

he likes to go?

Yes, but he's not there. I've checked

32:42.480 --> 32:44.690
Didn't he tell you where he was going?

32:44.815 --> 32:48.402
No. We're usually not speaking
when he leaves.

- A week.

I never knew there were so many Vs.

34:01.684 --> 34:04.061
Could you find
my husband for me, please?

34:04.186 --> 34:06.856
- Is Roger Wade his real name?
- Why?

34:06.981 --> 34:10.650
If Roger Wade isn't his real name,
he might be using his real name.

34:10.775 --> 34:13.027
Actually, he did change his name.

34:13.154 --> 34:17.324
His publishers thought Billy Joe Smith
lacked something for the books he writes.

34:17.449 --> 34:21.911
Roger Wade ain't exactly the ticket
for the kind of book he writes either.

34:22.036 --> 34:24.706
His publishers are happy.
That's all that matters.

34:24.831 --> 34:29.503
Probably Smith's the name that most of
Dr V's clients use. Is that a picture of him?

34:29.628 --> 34:34.341
I see what you mean about his face. Does
he usually walk around in that costume?

That way there's no misunderstanding.

- Sure. I'll be here.

- There's nobody that looks like that.

35:46.413 --> 35:51.043
You look just like my Great Aunt Esther.
She passed on a couple of years ago.

- Dr Verringer is out of town.

35:55.047 --> 35:56.966
- In Phoenix.
- Phoenix, Arizona.

37:22.134 --> 37:26.597
- Are you looking for someone?
- No, I'm gonna deliver this book.

37:26.722 --> 37:30.559
- To whom are you delivering the book?
- The man who wrote it, Roger Wade.

37:30.684 --> 37:34.396
But they told you
there's no one here by that name.

37:34.522 --> 37:38.359
- Good morning, Dr Verringer.
- They told me you weren't here either.

37:38.484 --> 37:42.154
This is a private hospital.
I can't have strangers prowling about.

37:42.279 --> 37:45.950
- I must ask you to leave.
- I hear you, Doctor.

37:46.075 --> 37:48.828
Could you tell me
the nature of your business here?

37:48.953 --> 37:52.248
If Roger Wade isn't here,
why do you care?

<i>EILEEN:

37:55.543 --> 37:57.503
Verringer denied being Verringer,

37:57.628 --> 38:02.466
pretended he didn't know your husband's
name and wouldn't look at his picture.

38:02.591 --> 38:05.719
So I'm reasonably sure
that's where your husband is staying,

38:05.845 --> 38:08.347
but there is something
we could do to make sure.

38:08.472 --> 38:09.682
What's that?

38:09.807 --> 38:13.727
If you came back there with me,
Dr Verringer couldn't dismiss you.

38:13.853 --> 38:16.147
He'd just have to answer to you.

38:16.272 --> 38:19.150

but not to talk to a jerk like Verringer?

38:24.697 --> 38:27.074
It's not Verringer. It's Roger.

38:27.199 --> 38:30.453
He doesn't want me to find him
or know why he's hiding out there.

38:30.578 --> 38:32.580
What's he gonna do when I walk in?

38:32.705 --> 38:37.960

50:04.522 --> 50:06.565
I want my money!

50:07.483 --> 50:09.985
Why would I have
anything belonging to you?

50:10.111 --> 50:12.655
You're famous.
You got your picture in the paper.

50:12.780 --> 50:16.408
Everybody knows you.
You run a Mexican taxi service.

50:16.534 --> 50:19.954
- You made a deal with Terry Lennox.
- Terry Lennox was my friend.

50:20.079 --> 50:22.581
He asked me to give him a lift.
I wish I hadn't.

50:22.706 --> 50:25.751
Your friend was a criminal.
He murdered his wife.

50:25.876 --> 50:30.589
- That's a lie. He couldn't kill anybody.
- That's a minor crime, a misdemeanour.

50:30.714 --> 50:35.719
The major crime is he stole my money.
The penalty for that is capital punishment.

50:35.845 --> 50:41.308
- That's what they call it? It wasn't suicide.
- I don't give a goddamn how he died.

50:41.434 --> 50:46.897
I just care about $355,000 of my money he
was supposed to deliver to Mexico City.

51:19.430 --> 51:25.144
Honey, I'm sorry. I heard some noises
outside the car and I got scared.

51:25.269 --> 51:27.313
Can I have a Coke?

51:28.647 --> 51:30.691
Come on in, darling.

This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler.
This is Philip Marlowe.

51:43.871 --> 51:46.749
- Very pleased to meet you.
- Do you have a Coke?

51:46.874 --> 51:48.918
- In the icebox.
- Harry.

51:54.381 --> 52:00.221
Delicate, sweet. A little noise in the car'll
give her dreams for a week.

52:00.346 --> 52:02.681
- It's probably a squirrel.
- Marty.

52:06.685 --> 52:09.188
I didn't drink it.

52:09.313 --> 52:13.692
You don't want this

52:13.818 --> 52:15.861
It's flat.

52:17.571 --> 52:19.615
Look.

52:20.741 --> 52:25.121
Look at that face,
a face for a magazine cover.

52:25.246 --> 52:28.416
That profile. You're beautiful.

52:29.417 --> 52:31.377
And I love you.

52:32.128 --> 52:34.296
I do.

52:34.422 --> 52:39.176
I sleep with a lot of girls,
but I make love to you, right?

52:40.428 --> 52:45.015

Hi, Cary. There's this spiffy kid who's

No cars out there. Just some sagebrush
and a few covered wagons.

You bring my boy Billy? Left him out there

Where do you think you're going?
You're not supposed to let me see you.

your working clothes.

I'm wearing my working clothes.
Can I buy you a drink?

- No. A little early for me.
- You're looking well.

Hello, Mr Marlowe.
Nice of you to come back.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:15.127
Dropped your cigarette, huh?

01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:20.132
So, did you come here
to see me or my wife?

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:23.761
I just came to see how you were doing.

01:02:23.886 --> 01:02:26.514
I have a little idea.
I'd like to talk to my wife.

01:02:26.639 --> 01:02:30.559
So maybe you'd go out on the beach
for a bit and then we'll call you.

01:02:30.684 --> 01:02:34.146
It's OK with me. I just wanted to see
how you were. I'll be going.

01:02:34.271 --> 01:02:36.899
Please, you don't have to go.
Can't you stay?

01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:44.240
On second thought, I guess
I'll go down and count the waves.

01:02:44.365 --> 01:02:46.409
Do that.

01:02:49.787 --> 01:02:52.706
- Sleep well?
- As well as ever.

01:02:52.832 --> 01:02:55.209
As well as ever. Pills?

01:02:55.334 --> 01:02:57.378
No.

01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:04.677
Contessa, perhaps you'd be kind enough
to get me a bottle of milk?

01:03:04.802 --> 01:03:07.847
Milk? Is that what you really want?

01:03:08.848 --> 01:03:10.891
Would you say that once more?

01:03:11.016 --> 01:03:13.727
I asked: Is milk what you really want?

01:03:32.246 --> 01:03:36.792
You'd think I was drunk already.
I'll make a toast. To us.

01:03:42.339 --> 01:03:45.384
Oh, God! Yeah, yeah!

01:03:45.509 --> 01:03:47.762
That's OK.

01:03:47.887 --> 01:03:53.350
Last night we talked about something
important, but I can't remember what.

01:03:54.018 --> 01:03:58.773
I simply said if you go on drinking,
I'm gonna leave you.

01:03:59.607 --> 01:04:01.734
You're gonna leave me?

01:04:01.859 --> 01:04:03.944
Yes.

- Do what I say.

I wish you'd take that goddamn tie off

but I'm not gonna take my tie off.

You leave your tie on. I got champagne,
beer, Scotch, bourbon, aquavit, port.

- What are you drinking?
- What I'm drinking is called aquavit.

01:07:42.621 --> 01:07:47.334
- I'm drinking what you're drinking.
- God bless you. I like to hear that.

I want that, and a twist of lemon." Balls!

- But you've got a pretty good face.
- You study faces?

You don't get to grow a face like mine

behaviour at the party correct?

01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:17.046
Yeah. Everybody is here having
a party now. Everybody's drunk!

01:27:17.171 --> 01:27:20.091
Your husband was upset
over Dr Verringer's visit.

01:27:20.216 --> 01:27:24.095
He threw everybody out, passed out
and left you alone with Marlowe.

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.680
I asked Mr Marlowe to stay.

01:27:26.806 --> 01:27:30.476
And there was no motive that he
might have had for killing himself?

01:27:30.601 --> 01:27:36.357
Why don't you get a couple of sand crabs,
stick 'em up your nose and disappear?

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:43.322
You go and join him. Will you go upstairs
and tweeze your eyebrows? Just go back.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.202
Eileen, are you lying about Roger?

01:27:48.994 --> 01:27:51.247
Are you lying about Roger?

01:27:52.164 --> 01:27:58.379
Your crazy, Looney Tune husband
could have killed Sylvia Lennox.

01:27:59.088 --> 01:28:00.923
Look...

01:28:01.048 --> 01:28:06.095
He's not gonna be walking outta there.
I'm sorry. I thought the guy was OK.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.141
But the police say
that Terry Lennox killed his wife.

01:28:10.266 --> 01:28:13.352
- You tell me what really happened.
- Really happened?

01:28:13.477 --> 01:28:19.400
Look, Terry Lennox is dead. I wanna know
who killed him, because that guy is dead.

01:28:19.525 --> 01:28:21.902
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened?

01:28:22.027 --> 01:28:27.324
- He killed Sylvia. I think so. I don't know.
- You think he killed Sylvia Lennox?

01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:38.419
Did you just say that you think
that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox?

01:28:38.544 --> 01:28:40.629
Are you telling me the truth?

01:28:40.755 --> 01:28:45.926
I couldn't tell anybody. I couldn't tell
anybody Roger had an affair with Sylvia.

01:28:46.051 --> 01:28:50.181
And Terry found out.
And Sylvia wanted to break it off.

01:28:50.306 --> 01:28:55.019
And Roger was jealous and Roger went
to see her and... then she was dead.

01:28:55.144 --> 01:28:58.564
And then I read in the paper
that Terry confessed.

01:28:58.689 --> 01:29:02.443
- And I don't know what to think.
- You don't know what to think?

01:29:02.568 --> 01:29:07.740
I know what to think. I know
what to do and I know what to think.

01:29:08.949 --> 01:29:14.121
Farmer! I want you to open up the
Terry Lennox case. I got new information.

01:29:14.246 --> 01:29:18.959
I have fresh evidence
for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case.

01:29:19.085 --> 01:29:23.214
The lady down there, Mrs Roger Wade,
is prepared to give evidence

01:29:23.339 --> 01:29:28.677
that her husband was sleeping with Sylvia
Lennox the night that she was killed.

01:29:28.803 --> 01:29:34.225
I had my ass busted for three days
because you said my friend killed her.

01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:38.104
We know that Roger Wade
saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon.

01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:42.942
We know what time he left her. We know
he went directly to Verringer's clinic.

01:29:43.067 --> 01:29:47.321
- You knew all the time?
- He was there all the time and in sedation.

01:29:47.446 --> 01:29:52.451
So do me a favour. Go back to your
gumshoes and peeping and let us alone.

01:29:54.787 --> 01:29:58.124
- You want me to let you alone?
- That's right. Let us alone.

01:29:58.249 --> 01:30:02.211
You son of a bitch. You're gonna
get everything all straightened out.

01:30:02.336 --> 01:30:04.880
I saw that man who walked into
the Pacific Ocean

01:30:05.005 --> 01:30:09.593
gave Dr Whatever-his-name-is $5,000
for an alibi so you could keep your job.

01:30:09.718 --> 01:30:13.639
I'm gonna call Ronald Reagan
to kick your ass off.

01:30:13.764 --> 01:30:16.767
You're gonna be selling bus tickets,
you son of a bitch.

01:30:16.892 --> 01:30:21.397
Terry Lennox was my friend,
you motherfucker!

01:30:21.522 --> 01:30:24.734

- Vince, be so kind.
- Yes, sir.

- Augustine, I get the point.
- No, you don't.

- I get the point.
- The point is money!

01:32:18.973 --> 01:32:21.767
- Tell me where the money is.
- I don't know where it is.

01:32:21.892 --> 01:32:26.355
I don't like getting excited like this.
I really don't like it.

01:32:34.905 --> 01:32:36.949
Marlowe...

01:32:38.325 --> 01:32:43.914
You remember the night Jo Ann became
ill and we had to take her to the hospital?

01:32:44.039 --> 01:32:47.626
As you can see,
she's had extensive treatment.

01:32:47.752 --> 01:32:52.214
The finest surgeons, had nurses
around the clock, the best attention,

01:32:52.339 --> 01:32:57.136
because, as you know,
she's very near and dear to me.

01:32:57.261 --> 01:33:01.599
And the prognosis is excellent.
Excellent. She's going to be fine.

01:33:03.642 --> 01:33:05.895
Now...

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:11.400
I left the hospital that night
and I was... really upset.

01:33:11.525 --> 01:33:13.778
- I was... What was I?
- Haunted.

01:33:13.903 --> 01:33:15.863
- What?
- Haunted.

01:33:15.988 --> 01:33:21.952
That's it. I was haunted with the idea
that somehow I'd not been fair to her.

01:33:22.078 --> 01:33:26.207
No matter how many times I would go over
it, I realised I had not been fair to her.

01:33:26.332 --> 01:33:28.876
Sit down over there, far away.

01:33:30.044 --> 01:33:34.465
What had she done? Absolutely nothing.
You were the one I was angry with.

01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:37.468
<i>I was taking out on her
what I should have been giving you!</i>

01:33:37.593 --> 01:33:40.179
So I knew at that moment
that I had to apologise.

01:33:40.304 --> 01:33:42.473
I had to apologise in
a very special way.

01:33:42.598 --> 01:33:45.643
It had to be total and
it had to be honest.

01:33:45.768 --> 01:33:49.230
After all, I had caused the girl
considerable discomfort.

01:33:49.355 --> 01:33:52.817
I went to the hospital, to her room.
Nobody was there. It was dark.

01:33:52.942 --> 01:33:57.696
I took off all my clothes, undressed
completely, and stood before her naked.

01:33:57.822 --> 01:34:01.992
And I said to her "Jo Ann, I apologise."

01:34:02.868 --> 01:34:06.705
"You see a man standing before you
with nothing to hide." Is that right?

01:34:06.831 --> 01:34:08.541
Yes, Marty.

01:34:08.666 --> 01:34:14.130
- So what do you want me to do?
- I want you to take off your clothes.

01:34:15.881 --> 01:34:19.593
I have nothing to hide either,
but I'm not gonna take my clothes off.

01:34:19.718 --> 01:34:22.138
Get naked and tell me the truth
about my money.

01:34:22.263 --> 01:34:25.724
- You wanna take your clothes off?
- It's a pleasure.

01:34:25.850 --> 01:34:29.311
As a matter of fact,
everybody take off their clothes.

01:34:29.437 --> 01:34:31.522
I have too many scars.

01:34:31.647 --> 01:34:34.859
I understand. Go on inside
and take care of the telephone.

01:34:34.984 --> 01:34:39.447
In the meantime everybody takes off
their clothes. Harry, take off your clothes.

01:34:39.572 --> 01:34:42.158
- George Raft never took his clothes off.
- Help him.

01:34:42.283 --> 01:34:44.535
One second. I don't need any help.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:48.539
Jo Ann, I want you to wait right here.
I'd like you to see what goes on.

01:34:48.664 --> 01:34:51.000
This is what I owe you.
I owe this much to you.

01:34:51.125 --> 01:34:54.503
I understand you're nervous.
You're nervous like I was.

01:34:54.628 --> 01:34:58.466
When I was a kid, in high school,
I used to dread gym class.

01:34:58.591 --> 01:35:02.928
Absolutely dread it. Because I didn't have
any pubic hair till I was 15 years old.

01:35:03.053 --> 01:35:06.432
You must have looked like
one of the Three Little Pigs.

01:35:06.557 --> 01:35:11.020
Take it easy. It's very simple.
The man is nerv...

01:35:11.145 --> 01:35:13.481
Just a minute. Look at this.

01:35:17.276 --> 01:35:21.322
- What's that?
- A picture of James Madison.

01:35:21.447 --> 01:35:25.993
It's a $5,000 bill. See? You take off your
clothes, everything comes out honest.

01:35:26.118 --> 01:35:30.081
You know how many of these there are
in this country? Very few.

01:35:30.206 --> 01:35:33.959
Three were in the suitcase Terry Lennox
was supposed to take to Mexico.

01:35:34.085 --> 01:35:36.420
- Where'd you get this?
- Box of Cracker Jacks.

01:35:36.545 --> 01:35:41.050
- Bullshit! Where did you get it?
- A client sent it to me.

01:35:41.175 --> 01:35:44.428
A client is bullshit.
Are you laughing at me?

01:35:44.553 --> 01:35:47.598
I see you're laughing.
I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

01:35:47.723 --> 01:35:50.851
Is Terry Lennox alive?
Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox?

01:35:50.976 --> 01:35:55.022
Do you think it's funny to steal
$355,000 from Marty Augustine?

01:35:55.147 --> 01:35:58.484
- Jack, let me see that knife.
- With pleasure, Marty.

01:35:58.609 --> 01:36:00.653

- Where?

01:42:16.445 --> 01:42:20.199
- Who are you?
- Marlowe. I'm looking for Mrs Wade.

01:42:20.324 --> 01:42:21.951
- You're not Mr Katz?
- No.

01:42:22.076 --> 01:42:27.206
I can't give you any information.
I work for Surfside Realty. Call them.

01:42:27.331 --> 01:42:34.213
They'll give you any information you'd like
to know. If you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

01:42:34.338 --> 01:42:40.302
Mrs Tooks, where's Mrs Eileen Wade?
That's who I'm looking for.

01:42:40.428 --> 01:42:46.392
Mrs Wade? I think she's gone to Europe.
I'm not allowed to tell you. I'm sorry, sir.

01:42:46.517 --> 01:42:50.980
You'll just have to call
the real-estate office.

01:42:51.105 --> 01:42:55.943
- Ladies, it's OK with me.
- Goodbye, Mr Katz. Nice to have met you.

01:42:56.068 --> 01:43:01.240
We're dancing in the sand
and our bodies are in ecstasy.

01:43:01.365 --> 01:43:07.538
We're seeing colours, all the most
beautiful colours you can imagine.

01:43:07.663 --> 01:43:11.292
And we're holding hands
because we're one,

01:43:11.417 --> 01:43:16.547
and our breasts become full
and our arms become free

01:43:16.672 --> 01:43:19.258
and our bodies become free.

01:43:19.383 --> 01:43:21.635
And we are now beautiful.

01:43:21.761 --> 01:43:25.473
We are now beautiful and we are now one.

01:43:26.807 --> 01:43:31.270
- Nothing will come between...
- Hi, girls. You seen my cat?

01:43:31.395 --> 01:43:35.608
The other day he ran away, and I'm
leaving town for a couple of days.

01:43:35.733 --> 01:43:41.697
I'd appreciate it, if he shows up, if you
could look after him or give him milk.

01:43:41.822 --> 01:43:46.702
They're not even there. It's OK with me.
A melon convention.

01:43:46.827 --> 01:43:51.332
Our breasts are full, our bodies warm.

01:43:51.457 --> 01:43:54.835
We hear music and dance to the music...

01:44:26.367 --> 01:44:29.120
Señor Marlowe,
I want to show you our town.

01:44:29.245 --> 01:44:34.375
It's a beautiful town but I don't think
I wanna go sightseeing right now.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:40.798
- There are things I'd like to get straight.
- It's better if we talk inside.

01:44:44.051 --> 01:44:47.304
<i>MARLOWE: This is the largest
police car I've ever seen.</i>

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:50.891
- It's like a gold chariot.
- Very nice, Señor Marlowe.

01:44:51.016 --> 01:44:54.395
But I think I have to
change it this year.

01:44:55.896 --> 01:45:01.944
Look, Señor Marlowe. We're fixing the
roads and all those things, the streets.

01:45:02.069 --> 01:45:08.576
<i>MARLOWE: I know how civic-minded
you are, but I've come for the truth.</i>

01:45:08.701 --> 01:45:13.372
- The truth about Terry Lennox.
- He's dead. You saw the...

01:45:13.497 --> 01:45:18.252
You told me a good story and I saw some
good pictures of a guy who looked dead,

01:45:18.377 --> 01:45:20.880
but the truth
is coming together now, boys.

01:45:21.005 --> 01:45:24.675
I'm prepared to make a donation
to the people of this town.

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:30.431
Since you're their representatives, I can
tell you that I'm prepared, right now,

01:45:30.556 --> 01:45:34.435
to give you a James Madison.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.562
James Madison?

01:45:36.687 --> 01:45:41.650
<i>MARLOWE: A grand president.
Five grand.</i>

01:45:41.776 --> 01:45:45.821
- You think you can bribe us?
- Bribe? Oh, no!

01:45:45.946 --> 01:45:50.618
Bribe? This is charity I'm talking about.
You can buy a lot of cobblestones

01:45:50.743 --> 01:45:54.330
for a little light shown on the matter.

01:45:54.455 --> 01:45:57.666
<i>CORONER: I'll tell you what happened
to Terry Lennox.</i>

01:45:57.792 --> 01:46:02.963
The suicide was a fake, of course.

01:46:03.089 --> 01:46:07.093
I put the injection so it looked like
he was dead, but he wasn't dead.

01:46:07.218 --> 01:46:12.932
Put a gun to his head but the wound was
harmless. Then we took him in a coffin.

01:46:13.057 --> 01:46:16.477
Took the pictures, with the ice.
It looked perfect.

01:46:16.602 --> 01:46:20.606
We buried the coffin loaded with stones.

01:46:20.731 --> 01:46:23.818
<i>MARLOWE: Mr Lennox
is also charitable. What did he...</i>

01:46:23.943 --> 01:46:27.446
- Just a Madison.
- So you know James Madison?

01:46:27.571 --> 01:46:32.785
- We met him for the first time, yes.
- Lennox is still alive and well, señor.

01:47:53.491 --> 01:47:55.534
How you doin', Terry?

01:47:57.828 --> 01:47:59.872
Marlowe?

01:48:03.042 --> 01:48:06.462
I guess if anybody was gonna
track me down, it would be you.

01:48:06.587 --> 01:48:10.341
- Want a drink or something?
- No, I don't want no drink.

01:48:10.466 --> 01:48:12.718
You get a kick
out of that Madison I sent you?

01:48:12.843 --> 01:48:15.096
Yeah, I got a big kick out of it.

01:48:15.221 --> 01:48:17.598
So you murdered your wife, Terry?

01:48:17.723 --> 01:48:20.267
I killed her,
but you can't call it murder.

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:24.230
Wade told her about Eileen and me,
she started screaming.

01:48:24.355 --> 01:48:26.524
She was gonna tell the cops.

01:48:26.649 --> 01:48:30.486
She knew I was carrying money for
Augustine. She was gonna turn me in.

01:48:30.611 --> 01:48:34.073
I hit her. I didn't try to kill her.
I hit her. I didn't mean it.

01:48:34.198 --> 01:48:37.576
I saw the photographs.
You bashed her face in.

01:48:38.327 --> 01:48:40.871
She didn't give me any choice.

01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:46.043
You didn't have much choice, huh?
So you used me.

01:48:46.168 --> 01:48:51.382
That's what friends are for.
I was in a jam. Come on, have a drink.

01:48:51.507 --> 01:48:54.760
I had a dead wife,
$350,000 that doesn't belong to me.

01:48:54.885 --> 01:48:58.639
- I had to get out. It's as simple as that.
- Simple as that.

01:48:58.764 --> 01:49:05.062
Goddamn simple. Cops have me
legally dead, Augustine's got his money.

01:49:05.187 --> 01:49:10.109
<i>I got a girl that loves me. She's got
more money than Sylvia and Augustine.</i>

01:49:10.234 --> 01:49:15.114
- What the hell? Nobody cares.
- Yeah. Nobody cares but me.

01:49:15.239 --> 01:49:19.243
That's you, Marlowe.
You'll never learn. You're a born loser.

01:49:19.368 --> 01:49:21.787
Yeah. I even lost my cat.
