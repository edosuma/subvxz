03:54.993 --> 03:57.513
- Hello?
- Anna: Good morning, Lauren.

03:58.272 --> 04:01.251
Anna. I'm so glad you called.

04:01.275 --> 04:04.485
Just checking in on you.
How are you feeling?

04:05.003 --> 04:06.004
Erm...

04:06.487 --> 04:09.846
I haven't been
sleeping well lately.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.320
You do sound tired.

04:11.596 --> 04:13.505
Have you been up all
night writing again?

04:13.529 --> 04:15.289
I wish.

04:16.014 --> 04:19.096
Are you telling me you see
dead people, like Rachel?

04:21.778 --> 04:23.435
Anna, you know,
that's not funny.

04:24.333 --> 04:27.312
Sorry. She keeps putting
crazy ideas into your head.

04:27.336 --> 04:28.958
I should talk to her.

04:29.717 --> 04:31.857
Yeah, well, you can do that.

04:33.342 --> 04:36.483
Why don't we gather
tonight here at my house?

04:37.346 --> 04:40.314
- Tonight, around 7:00?
- Are you sure?

04:40.659 --> 04:42.637
Yeah... I really want
to see everybody

04:42.661 --> 04:44.329
and catch up, you know?

04:44.353 --> 04:46.227
It'll be fun to see
the girls, right?

04:46.251 --> 04:49.437
Okay. I'll call them.
Seven, all right?

04:49.461 --> 04:52.740
Great. Thanks. I can't wait.

08:10.006 --> 08:12.733
- Lauren, there you are.
- Come in. Come in.

08:15.356 --> 08:17.255
Here I am, as requested.

08:17.566 --> 08:22.201
What time is it? Is
it 7:00 already?

08:22.225 --> 08:23.505
You slept through the whole day?

08:23.882 --> 08:26.861
I was trying to write.
Time has just slipped by.

08:26.885 --> 08:29.070
I'm sorry, I didn't get
to prepare anything.

08:29.094 --> 08:31.107
No need for apologies, but
you still need to pull

08:31.131 --> 08:32.857
- yourself together.
- Yeah.

08:33.789 --> 08:35.870
I'm just so glad
that you're here.

08:35.894 --> 08:37.102
Especially today.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.898
Especially today.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.492
- Lauren.
- What?

08:48.113 --> 08:50.609
You should've sold this
house a long time ago.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.370
I can't. I couldn't.

08:53.394 --> 08:54.637
It's my mom's house.

08:55.086 --> 08:57.502
Have you heard the expression,
"let sleeping dogs lie?"

08:57.882 --> 09:00.643
Yeah. But what does that
have to do with anything?

09:01.437 --> 09:05.210
Gathering us all here,
on the anniversary

09:05.234 --> 09:06.476
of the day it happened.

09:07.892 --> 09:11.758
Well, what's dead
is gone, right?

09:12.103 --> 09:13.622
I'm not talking about that.

09:14.899 --> 09:16.486
I'm worried about you.

09:17.971 --> 09:19.800
Are you still going to therapy?

09:20.076 --> 09:23.735
Yes. I'm taking the medications
my psychiatrist prescribed.

09:27.532 --> 09:30.673
Lauren, stop. You're
creeping me out.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.301
I feel like someone's watching.

09:39.648 --> 09:41.442
How long have you been
feeling this way?

09:42.340 --> 09:45.136
You know, since that night...

09:46.206 --> 09:47.932
Especially this week.

09:50.003 --> 09:52.188
Have you considered
checking yourself back

09:52.212 --> 09:53.465
into supervised care?

09:53.489 --> 09:55.156
You know I can't
write like that.

09:55.180 --> 09:57.296
What is more important,

09:57.320 --> 09:59.391
your literary career
or your life?

10:01.048 --> 10:04.638
I can't think. I'm so tired.

10:05.674 --> 10:10.886
Lauren, please, let me
take you in tomorrow.

10:12.681 --> 10:14.544
Kat: What?

10:16.132 --> 10:17.962
You never want to see me again?

10:18.514 --> 10:21.527
Seriously? How incredibly
ungrateful you are?

10:22.794 --> 10:24.037
What was that?

10:24.554 --> 10:26.354
Kat: After all the
sacrifices I gave to you...

10:26.378 --> 10:28.120
The house is always
settling, so...

10:28.144 --> 10:30.675
Termites? I will
get the dust pan.

10:30.699 --> 10:31.907
Okay.

10:33.494 --> 10:36.152
Kat: Oh, no, no, no, no,
you can't say that to me.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.742
Why? Why? Because
I'm your mother.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.160
Ken? Kenneth?

10:45.817 --> 10:47.692
Kat, is everything okay?

10:47.716 --> 10:51.064
Kids, can't live with them,
can't live without them.

10:54.274 --> 10:55.931
Oh, Lauren.

10:56.863 --> 10:59.738
You should've let me take you
away to Paris this summer.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.833
I had a grand ol' time.

11:02.075 --> 11:03.835
I would've only slowed you down.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.286
Well, maybe I would've
revved you up a little.

11:07.632 --> 11:09.886
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

11:09.910 --> 11:13.051
Oh, the house has a
mind of its own.

11:13.603 --> 11:15.536
Oh, what a mess.

11:16.399 --> 11:19.585
You look wonderful, Kat. And
that bag's really something.

11:19.609 --> 11:21.715
Thank you. Look
what I got for us.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.246
Oh, I'm not supposed to
drink on medication.

11:25.270 --> 11:28.757
Oh, what your doctor doesn't
know won't hurt him. Trust me.

11:29.412 --> 11:31.943
So, Kat, what's going on?

11:31.967 --> 11:34.359
We heard you yelling
at your son.

11:34.383 --> 11:37.258
- He ran away to Vegas.
- To get married?

11:37.282 --> 11:39.847
He did, to that white
trash, gold digger.

11:39.871 --> 11:42.056
Well, he's 18. He's an adult.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.050
You did the best you could.
Congratulations on the nuptials.

11:49.778 --> 11:53.033
- How are your children?
- I count my blessings.

11:53.057 --> 11:56.726
A future cardiologist,
an engineer and a banker

11:56.750 --> 11:58.407
all in one family.

11:58.959 --> 12:02.307
Not that there's anything wrong
with being a total stereotype.

12:06.242 --> 12:08.151
You know, why don't you
give Ken some time?

12:08.175 --> 12:09.590
He might come around.

12:09.832 --> 12:12.984
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, he's your flesh and blood.

12:13.008 --> 12:14.928
No matter what happens,
you belong to each other.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.747
- He didn't even invite me.
- Please, Kat.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.473
It's not the end of the world.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.751
Let him rebel and
find his own way.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.996
Easy for you to say with
your three perfect children.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.678
I only have Ken. He
means everything to me.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.900
- Ow!
- Lauren: Kat?

12:32.924 --> 12:34.695
That looks bad.

12:34.719 --> 12:37.146
For a plastic surgeon, you
should be more careful

12:37.170 --> 12:39.665
- around sharp things.
- I was only trying to help.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.978
- Here. Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

12:42.002 --> 12:44.601
I just nicked a vein.
It's all right.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.386
I have everything I
need to close it up.

12:53.669 --> 12:57.811
- Hi, Rachel.
- Oh, beautiful as ever.

12:58.053 --> 13:00.272
- No. Thanks.
- Oh, my god.

13:00.296 --> 13:02.885
Come on in. For me?

13:04.749 --> 13:05.957
Thank you.

13:06.751 --> 13:10.179
- Oh!
- I'm sorry I'm late.

13:10.203 --> 13:12.457
I got caught up in a
new business blessing.

13:12.481 --> 13:15.805
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
I'm glad to see you.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.462
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:17.486 --> 13:19.291
I feel like sometimes,
you want your space

13:19.315 --> 13:21.742
- and then, again I don't, like...
- No, no, no, no, no.

13:23.354 --> 13:24.976
Thanks for being
patient with me.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.853
- My god, what is that?
- Oh.

13:28.877 --> 13:32.028
Uh... Luckily, the need
for spirit workers

13:32.052 --> 13:35.204
is finally on the rise and
I've got a lot of new cases.

13:35.228 --> 13:38.334
Well, yay. I'm so glad
to hear you're busy.

13:47.619 --> 13:52.901
Aw. So I guess I should ask you
how your novel is coming, hm?

13:53.522 --> 13:55.558
Um... it's not.

13:56.352 --> 13:57.629
What?

13:59.908 --> 14:02.289
Why don't you let me give
you reike for healing?

14:03.704 --> 14:05.845
It's not a healing
thing, I think.

14:06.707 --> 14:09.272
What, it's a regular
writer's block?

14:09.296 --> 14:10.860
You don't normally have that.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.484
- What's wrong?
- Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:12.508 --> 14:15.037
That's what it is. It's...
I'm blocked.

14:15.061 --> 14:16.234
Blocked?

14:17.270 --> 14:19.928
Well, there's definitely
something wrong here.

14:20.929 --> 14:22.275
The energy is all off.

14:24.415 --> 14:26.796
I gotta get to work.
So come on, let's go.

14:27.073 --> 14:29.189
Here, Kat, for your pain.

14:29.213 --> 14:31.387
Thank you, Anna.

14:31.629 --> 14:34.297
Kat, I'm going to have to
call your sponsor again.

14:34.321 --> 14:37.611
Roach, roach, I got maimed
helping Lauren clean up

14:37.635 --> 14:40.155
- her accident.
- I'll take that.

14:40.845 --> 14:42.882
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hi, Anna.

14:59.968 --> 15:01.946
You're the only one that
still uses that nickname

15:01.970 --> 15:04.765
- since third grade.
- It's a term of endearment.

15:05.974 --> 15:08.400
And you might want to
start adding a little

15:08.424 --> 15:10.092
color into your wardrobe.

15:14.258 --> 15:16.650
It's just so good to
have everybody here.

15:16.674 --> 15:19.308
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, Lauren, have a seat.

15:19.332 --> 15:21.137
Why don't we go into
the living room?

15:21.161 --> 15:22.967
Oh, no, the energy
is much better here.

15:22.991 --> 15:24.475
Lauren, here, come.

15:29.998 --> 15:32.838
Rachel, what on earth do you
have in your briefcase?

15:32.862 --> 15:35.186
- Tools of my trade.
- Wow.

15:35.210 --> 15:37.429
It looks like you brought
Jesus, Buddha, Allah

15:37.453 --> 15:39.259
and everybody else to the party.

15:39.283 --> 15:41.975
I thought you only did reiki?

15:42.665 --> 15:46.369
Well, energy balancing is
at the core of my work.

15:46.393 --> 15:50.156
But I brought an expanded arsenal.
I will need it.

15:52.882 --> 15:56.000
Rachel, I really
appreciate what you do and

15:56.024 --> 15:58.105
that you believe a séance
is going to do anything,

15:58.129 --> 15:59.693
but I don't think that...

15:59.717 --> 16:01.350
Lauren doesn't need
a séance as much

16:01.374 --> 16:03.283
as she needs a good
man in the sack.

16:03.307 --> 16:06.113
Oh, Kat. That's an
unnecessary thing to say.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.978
What? I'm only bringing up what
everybody is already thinking.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.842
Kat, just because your
mind is in the gutter,

16:10.866 --> 16:12.395
it doesn't mean we
have to hear it.

16:12.419 --> 16:14.501
Lauren, if that doesn't
interest you anymore,

16:14.525 --> 16:17.745
- I'm sure roach would love to.
- Kat, if you don't watch it,

16:17.769 --> 16:19.185
I'm going to send you to rehab.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.818
I maybe a lush, but at
least I don't avoid

16:21.842 --> 16:24.362
dealing with life by
obsessing over the occult.

16:25.570 --> 16:29.022
It's no use. It's too dug in.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.922
How do you feel
about an exorcism?

16:36.581 --> 16:38.169
- Excuse me.
- Lauren.

16:38.963 --> 16:41.700
- Lauren, are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:41.724 --> 16:44.772
Rachel, your Sage is
really irritating my eyes.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.419
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

16:51.976 --> 16:53.576
I don't think she's
ever gotten over him.

17:00.916 --> 17:03.608
What?

17:21.005 --> 17:24.042
How can she still be
so hung up on him?

17:24.491 --> 17:26.469
I mean, I know she's
a hopeless romantic,

17:26.492 --> 17:28.644
but isn't this a little extreme?

17:28.668 --> 17:30.956
It's the 20th
anniversary, isn't it?

17:30.980 --> 17:33.269
Oh, is anniversary
really the right word?

17:33.293 --> 17:35.892
Whatever it is, we
promised to be here

17:35.916 --> 17:37.618
to give her whatever
support she needs.

17:37.642 --> 17:41.105
Haven't we already done
that or at least offered?

17:41.129 --> 17:43.797
What she really needs is
to settle the spirits

17:43.821 --> 17:46.099
that haunt her or get the
hell out of this place.

17:46.410 --> 17:48.308
Okay. Okay.

18:41.879 --> 18:44.916
- What is all of this?
- Take your seat.

18:45.193 --> 18:47.032
But be careful with the salt.

18:47.056 --> 18:48.403
Come, Lauren.

18:49.507 --> 18:52.176
Lauren: What do you think
this is all supposed to do?

18:52.200 --> 18:55.099
Oh, we're just balancing
the energy around you.

18:56.065 --> 18:59.838
Don't worry. It
should be harmless.

18:59.862 --> 19:02.876
Oh, goody. I get to
spend mischief night

19:02.900 --> 19:05.074
with a bunch of
superstitious freaks.

19:05.558 --> 19:06.697
Be quiet, Kat.

19:07.007 --> 19:08.837
Not everything is
always about you.

19:10.079 --> 19:11.322
Okay.

19:13.359 --> 19:14.670
Come on.

19:16.672 --> 19:19.088
There.

19:26.786 --> 19:29.582
Restless spirit, hear us.

19:31.031 --> 19:34.725
We acknowledge the evil
that has been done to you.

19:35.933 --> 19:39.212
But you must also acknowledge
the wrongs that you have done.

19:40.351 --> 19:42.767
Let your spirit rest.

19:44.079 --> 19:46.461
Be free in the afterlife.

19:47.565 --> 19:48.877
Man: Hello?

19:50.050 --> 19:53.364
- Did you hear that?
- Return to the universal energy.

19:53.985 --> 19:58.197
Let go of the ties to this
life and move on to the next.

20:00.406 --> 20:02.442
Spirit, stay back.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.791
What are you all doing
here sitting in the dark?

20:08.828 --> 20:10.554
Did you know your
front door was open?

20:11.417 --> 20:12.418
Oh!

20:12.797 --> 20:14.810
Well, I didn't mean
to scare you guys.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.249
My name is Derek.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.908
One of you is my mother...

20:22.566 --> 20:24.578
And I came here to find
what happened to my father.

20:24.602 --> 20:26.322
You are trespassing. I'm
calling the police.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.992
Now that you have our
full attention...

20:35.682 --> 20:38.616
What proof do we have that
you are who you say you are?

20:41.412 --> 20:45.520
Well, I was born on
June 30th, 1996.

20:46.659 --> 20:50.421
I was given up to the sisters of St.
Margaret for adoption.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.460
You could've found
that information.

20:55.184 --> 20:57.024
Maybe you are just an impostor.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.465
Why would he do that? Why
go to all that trouble?

20:59.948 --> 21:02.478
The only reason you
would've come here looking

21:02.502 --> 21:05.264
for your birth parents
is for money, right?

21:05.540 --> 21:09.026
No, people don't just disappear.

21:10.199 --> 21:13.858
You know, maybe they do in
your mystery novels, but...

21:15.895 --> 21:17.379
None in real life.

21:19.623 --> 21:21.452
Not unless they're dead.

21:23.523 --> 21:26.226
Look, why don't I just
pay you what you want

21:26.250 --> 21:27.872
and you leave us alone?

21:29.978 --> 21:32.612
You know, money can't
change the past

21:32.636 --> 21:34.917
or give me the life I would
have had with my real parents.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.157
What are you getting at?

21:37.813 --> 21:40.033
You cannot just expect
to walk in here and...

21:40.057 --> 21:43.474
Okay, stop everybody!
Just stop. Stop.

21:46.822 --> 21:47.823
It's okay.

21:55.728 --> 21:58.731
- When I gave you up, i...
- Shh! Don't.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.426
I can't...

22:05.393 --> 22:06.497
Why?

22:11.088 --> 22:14.367
- How did you find me?
- I paid to track you down.

22:17.094 --> 22:18.302
What happened, huh?

22:21.374 --> 22:22.938
There's no record of
my father anywhere

22:22.962 --> 22:24.895
after you filed the
missing person's report.

22:27.449 --> 22:29.649
And the private investigator
said that this only happens

22:29.673 --> 22:34.678
if someone goes into hiding,
goes into the mob, or dies.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.461
So, which is it, hm?

22:45.329 --> 22:50.230
Your father... hurt me.

22:54.062 --> 22:55.132
And then, he left?

22:56.271 --> 22:58.169
Will you hear me out?

23:00.620 --> 23:01.897
I can handle it.

23:02.553 --> 23:04.555
You deserve to know
who your father was.

23:10.354 --> 23:12.598
When we got married
25 years ago,

23:13.357 --> 23:15.014
we were madly in love.

23:17.568 --> 23:19.891
We were both from broken
homes, so when we connected,

23:19.915 --> 23:21.779
we felt like we
saved each other.

23:25.956 --> 23:28.452
It was inevitable that we would
end up hurting each other,

23:28.476 --> 23:32.272
but we loved each other so much.

23:34.516 --> 23:36.415
We thought we were stronger
than the troubles.

23:38.969 --> 23:40.142
We were wrong.

23:54.502 --> 23:58.022
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

23:58.851 --> 24:01.509
- I'll love you forever.
- Good.

24:04.339 --> 24:08.895
Man, you guys, be happy.
Be happy and I love you.

24:09.793 --> 24:12.288
It's just... I wish the
best with you guys.

24:12.312 --> 24:14.142
I really, really do.

24:15.384 --> 24:18.008
You guys are going to
be pretty remarkable.

24:26.672 --> 24:27.845
I love you.

24:28.536 --> 24:30.054
You are always my sister.

24:31.539 --> 24:35.370
You know that. I will
always be there for you.

24:36.854 --> 24:40.479
I don't think I can
drink another drink.

24:43.654 --> 24:47.531
Congratulations. First one
of us to get married.

24:47.555 --> 24:48.694
I love you.

24:49.177 --> 24:52.214
I hope you and Jake have
a wonderful marriage.

25:13.891 --> 25:15.444
You're like a kind of therapy.

25:17.239 --> 25:19.379
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

25:21.209 --> 25:22.486
You're mine, too.

25:25.869 --> 25:28.527
So much that you
almost make me forget.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.632
Almost?

25:36.465 --> 25:38.744
I never thought I could feel...

25:42.575 --> 25:45.889
- Safe.
- Listen to me.

25:47.718 --> 25:49.306
I'm going to make you feel safe.

25:54.622 --> 25:55.899
Jake...

25:59.178 --> 26:01.352
He's why I keep
locking the door.

26:09.188 --> 26:10.948
I tried to stop, but...

26:13.951 --> 26:17.748
My mom told me never to tell
anyone and it's just so...

26:19.129 --> 26:22.833
I don't care how weak she was.

26:22.857 --> 26:25.929
- She should've protected you.
- She tried.

26:27.344 --> 26:30.312
And how could he, to
his own daughter?

26:34.972 --> 26:39.459
If they weren't already dead,
I'd kill them for you.

26:46.984 --> 26:49.469
Jake. Jake.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.819
They were all I had.

26:55.475 --> 26:57.063
Let's just forget, please.

27:03.242 --> 27:04.415
You're mine, now.

27:06.141 --> 27:07.177
You're safe.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.126
This hard-boiled
detective never expected

27:15.150 --> 27:18.222
to fall in love with the
dame with the smoky voice.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.693
Babe, relax.

27:29.717 --> 27:30.997
Come over here and play with me.

27:36.275 --> 27:38.173
All you want to do is play.

27:38.553 --> 27:40.900
Some of us have to
work around here.

27:45.456 --> 27:47.217
You just start being no fun.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.706
Since we went broke.

27:55.018 --> 27:58.366
Babe, relax. The loan
is gonna come through.

28:01.093 --> 28:02.266
No.

28:02.750 --> 28:06.029
No, Jake, we can't take
out a second mortgage.

28:06.754 --> 28:08.376
I don't need you nagging me.

28:26.670 --> 28:28.303
If you don't care, I don't care.

28:28.327 --> 28:30.270
Goddamnit! Of course I care.

28:36.611 --> 28:37.716
You're gonna get that?

28:42.928 --> 28:44.239
No.

28:44.930 --> 28:47.346
That's probably another one
of those bill collectors.

28:54.456 --> 28:55.595
Hello.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.598
Look, I told you not call here.

28:59.841 --> 29:02.499
I said no. I'll call you later.

29:09.264 --> 29:11.829
- Who was that?
- It's a bill collector.

29:11.853 --> 29:12.958
No.

29:14.269 --> 29:18.456
It didn't sound like any bill
collector I've ever talked to.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.931
Yeah, well, I don't want to
deal with that right now.

29:27.386 --> 29:28.456
Babe, listen to me.

29:30.044 --> 29:31.666
I'm sorry you are stressed.

29:32.529 --> 29:34.773
I'll get another job soon.
I promise.

29:36.119 --> 29:37.810
I know. I know you will.

29:39.467 --> 29:42.228
Yeah, and then everything
is going to be fine.

29:44.058 --> 29:47.751
And then we can start a family
just like we always wanted.

29:49.891 --> 29:52.687
One little boy, one little girl.

29:55.897 --> 29:57.461
I don't know, Jake.

29:57.485 --> 29:59.659
Boy or a girl, I want both.

30:01.385 --> 30:02.559
Yeah.

30:04.216 --> 30:06.080
I'm going to make all
your dreams come true.

30:07.357 --> 30:08.565
I swear.

30:13.501 --> 30:19.586
Jake, please, I... I
think I need to write.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.658
I just need to make
myself feel better

30:22.682 --> 30:24.512
and I just don't
feel well right now.

30:29.413 --> 30:31.622
Your story, it can wait.

31:11.904 --> 31:13.250
Look, I said no.

31:14.803 --> 31:16.875
That was all I could
give, I'm sorry.

31:17.841 --> 31:18.946
No.

31:20.464 --> 31:21.983
Just leave us alone, okay?

31:27.471 --> 31:28.887
Holy shit, babe.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.476
What? Did I scare you?

31:33.270 --> 31:35.514
You give a man a heart
attack like that.

31:36.308 --> 31:39.449
- Who were you talking to?
- It was an investor.

31:40.243 --> 31:42.590
At one o'clock in the morning?

31:43.315 --> 31:45.006
Yeah. Well, you
know, this guy's...

32:15.105 --> 32:16.348
Pick that up.

32:23.217 --> 32:24.356
What for?

32:27.324 --> 32:29.154
It doesn't mean
anything anymore.

32:30.293 --> 32:31.846
Of course it means something.

32:35.539 --> 32:38.680
Tell that to whoever you're
screwing around with.

32:40.061 --> 32:42.305
No, I'm not. I'm
telling you the truth!

32:44.376 --> 32:46.757
Who was on the phone. Jake?

32:56.008 --> 32:57.288
Where do you think you're going?

32:57.837 --> 33:00.277
- Getting a hell out of here.
- Oh, you're not going anywhere.

33:00.301 --> 33:03.050
- Stop it, Jake. I'm leaving.
- You're not going anywhere.

33:03.326 --> 33:04.879
I'm done with you.

33:06.501 --> 33:10.309
You're done when I
say you're done.

33:10.333 --> 33:11.920
You're my wife.

33:16.684 --> 33:18.272
Jake, stop.

33:18.686 --> 33:22.217
Jake! Stop, what are you doing?

33:22.241 --> 33:24.840
Stop. Stop. No
please, don't do it.

33:24.864 --> 33:26.946
- Don't. No, Jake!
- You're my wife.

33:26.970 --> 33:29.845
- You're my wife.
- Stop. No!

33:29.869 --> 33:33.504
Jake, no! Don't, please don't.

33:33.528 --> 33:35.530
Jake, don't.

33:37.532 --> 33:41.536
- Jake, don't.
- Oh, baby.

34:07.390 --> 34:09.806
Stop. I said, "stop".

34:10.150 --> 34:12.291
I said, "stop"!

34:12.567 --> 34:18.090
Stop! Stop! Stop!

35:06.173 --> 35:07.173
Come.

35:10.901 --> 35:14.284
I already did, so hurry up.
She's on the way over too.

35:14.802 --> 35:17.218
Yes, now. Bye.

35:27.297 --> 35:28.747
The girls will be here soon.

35:32.095 --> 35:34.925
No, don't bother them.

35:36.168 --> 35:38.826
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not fine.

35:39.344 --> 35:41.691
Nothing about the
situation is fine.

35:45.073 --> 35:47.155
And if you only gone
to the police before,

35:47.179 --> 35:50.355
there'd be documented history
of domestic violence.

35:51.666 --> 35:53.323
I didn't think it was that bad.

35:55.877 --> 35:57.224
I pushed him.

35:58.225 --> 35:59.709
It was my fault.

36:01.124 --> 36:06.267
Lauren, you keep defending Jake.
But who's defending you?

36:10.961 --> 36:12.239
Oh, no.

36:14.033 --> 36:15.276
Jake.

36:27.530 --> 36:29.290
- What happened?
- Did they fight again?

36:31.258 --> 36:32.776
It's bad this time.

36:35.917 --> 36:38.196
- Interventions.
- They always come too late.

36:41.268 --> 36:42.762
What did he do?

36:45.789 --> 36:48.206
Oh, my god, your face.

36:49.068 --> 36:50.943
Lauren, you got to go
to the emergency room.

36:50.967 --> 36:54.073
No, I'm all right. I
don't want to go.

36:56.593 --> 36:58.250
Please don't make me go.

36:58.561 --> 37:01.943
Lauren, do you want to
tell them or shall I?

37:04.463 --> 37:07.949
She defended herself this
time and he might be dead.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.308
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

37:11.332 --> 37:13.793
She caught him with another
woman on the phone.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.440
- Who?
- What a surprise.

37:16.303 --> 37:17.683
No idea.

37:17.959 --> 37:20.283
But we have to go back there
with her to protect her

37:20.307 --> 37:22.101
- either way.
- Of course.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.986
There's no pulse.

38:20.159 --> 38:22.161
He's dead.

38:22.852 --> 38:24.025
Oh, hell no.

38:25.268 --> 38:27.557
- We have to call the police.
- Anna: I can't believe

38:27.581 --> 38:29.061
I'm saying this, but
none of us can go

38:29.085 --> 38:30.604
- to the police.
- Rachel: What?

38:30.894 --> 38:33.254
- Why can't we call the police?
- We can claim self-defense.

38:33.483 --> 38:35.461
Rachel: I've seen how
these cases played out.

38:35.485 --> 38:36.935
Her life will be ruined forever.

38:39.489 --> 38:43.113
We stick together no matter
what happens. Agreed?

38:46.116 --> 38:48.533
All for one, one for all.

38:49.913 --> 38:51.536
Sisters until we're in jail.

38:55.056 --> 38:56.541
- Okay. So now what?

38:57.127 --> 39:00.175
You're a doctor, can't you
get access to a morgue?

39:00.199 --> 39:02.177
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't know.

39:02.201 --> 39:03.720
My god, we can't do this.

39:05.515 --> 39:07.769
Well, how about I
get rid of him?

39:07.793 --> 39:10.289
- Yeah.
- What? How?

39:10.313 --> 39:13.499
I tag him as a John Doe. He gets cremated.
Case close.

39:13.523 --> 39:14.628
That is crazy.

39:15.870 --> 39:17.596
Well, it's either
that or the police?

39:18.563 --> 39:19.805
Rachel: She's right.

39:22.774 --> 39:23.878
Lauren?

39:24.603 --> 39:26.778
Okay. What do you want to do?

39:30.782 --> 39:32.749
Shh! The neighbors will hear.

39:33.474 --> 39:34.889
Calm down.

39:35.303 --> 39:36.960
- You two, get her inside.
- Okay.

39:50.560 --> 39:52.440
Did you kill my father
right here in this house?

39:56.808 --> 39:58.361
What the hell is wrong
with this place?

40:02.469 --> 40:04.826
Your mother is not
in her right mind.

40:04.850 --> 40:08.002
In fact, she was going
to commit herself,

40:08.026 --> 40:09.303
- tomorrow morning.
- Anna.

40:09.579 --> 40:13.272
Commit herself? What, to
a mental institution?

40:13.514 --> 40:14.860
Anna: A facility.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.624
So do you want to hear
the rest of the story?

40:21.936 --> 40:23.006
Tell me.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.391
- Thanks.
- It is not your fault.

40:28.943 --> 40:30.531
This is really for the best.

40:31.118 --> 40:32.578
He would've eventually
killed you,

40:32.602 --> 40:35.053
you know that, right?
That asshole.

40:35.605 --> 40:37.538
I mean, you probably
can't see it now...

40:38.539 --> 40:40.438
But it was either you or him...

40:41.680 --> 40:44.027
And the universe chose you.

40:52.070 --> 40:55.176
I'm just going to...
I don't feel well.

40:55.418 --> 40:56.454
Okay.

41:03.426 --> 41:05.784
We treat this as an
alcoholic, bankrupt husband

41:05.808 --> 41:07.016
abandoning his wife.

41:07.741 --> 41:10.022
She calls the police tomorrow.
I'll coach her what to say.

41:11.227 --> 41:13.160
Okay. That sounds about right.

41:14.713 --> 41:16.519
And what about her mental state?

41:16.543 --> 41:18.752
- What do you mean?
- Look at her.

41:19.407 --> 41:21.099
I'm afraid she's going
to hurt herself.

41:22.341 --> 41:23.377
I see.

41:24.067 --> 41:26.218
Well, then we all have to
take turns being with her

41:26.242 --> 41:27.485
until she feels better.

42:00.379 --> 42:02.485
Lauren? Hey.

42:03.728 --> 42:06.465
Shit. It's okay. It's okay.

42:06.489 --> 42:08.422
It's just morning
sickness, babe.

42:09.043 --> 42:11.218
It's okay, it's okay. Shh!

42:12.875 --> 42:15.256
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

42:17.880 --> 42:22.505
I... want...

42:22.988 --> 42:24.507
I want it.

42:24.956 --> 42:26.302
Are you sure?

42:27.130 --> 42:30.789
Yeah, I want... I want
to have a family.

42:32.722 --> 42:33.723
Okay.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.360
You're not actually considering
having Jake's baby, are you?

42:37.727 --> 42:40.167
What do you think you're going
to be putting yourself through?

42:42.629 --> 42:44.838
What if he turns out
evil like his father?

42:45.597 --> 42:47.634
You can't keep him,
you know that.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.509
You're going to have
to get stronger

42:50.533 --> 42:51.933
if you're going to
raise your child.

42:52.466 --> 42:55.100
One day he's going to want
to know who his father is,

42:55.124 --> 42:56.953
so you got to toughen up, okay?

42:57.609 --> 43:02.200
You know, we could raise
the kid together,

43:03.304 --> 43:04.305
if you wanted.

43:05.997 --> 43:07.377
I'd really like that.

44:16.550 --> 44:18.430
Anna: Are you sure you
want to give up the baby?

44:24.351 --> 44:26.560
I will make sure he
goes to a good home,

44:27.595 --> 44:30.195
with two loving parents
who can give him

44:30.219 --> 44:31.565
the upbringing he deserves.

44:36.743 --> 44:40.194
You don't have to bear the
responsibility anymore.

44:46.753 --> 44:48.409
Lauren: I don't have to explain.

44:53.414 --> 44:56.624
The doctor said you won't be
able to have any more children.

44:57.902 --> 45:01.191
You had what's called
placental abruption,

45:01.215 --> 45:04.253
so they gave you hysterectomy.

45:04.736 --> 45:07.784
But that's okay. You
have your writing career

45:07.808 --> 45:09.441
and you've already
sold your first book.

45:09.465 --> 45:11.432
And it's doing so well.

45:19.475 --> 45:20.959
There's one thing
I need to know.

45:22.098 --> 45:23.099
What?

45:24.307 --> 45:26.620
Would you ever...

45:29.071 --> 45:31.073
Oh, my god, Kat!

45:31.936 --> 45:33.776
Rachel: He's going to
run to the police.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.905
- He knows our secret.
- Lauren: God.

45:40.841 --> 45:43.602
- He's my son! Leave him alone!
- No.

45:48.435 --> 45:49.747
Lauren: Nobody touch him!

45:50.126 --> 45:52.046
Just give me some time to
think about what to do.

45:57.547 --> 45:59.101
Oh, my god, he is heavy.

45:59.342 --> 46:01.942
Lauren, Lauren stop. Think.
We could lose everything.

46:01.966 --> 46:04.358
First, Jake. Now, your son.

46:04.382 --> 46:06.833
I think the universe is
trying to tell us something.

46:07.109 --> 46:08.524
Don't be stupid.

46:09.007 --> 46:12.286
If none of you are gonna help
me, then don't get in my way!

46:13.460 --> 46:16.325
All right. All right.

46:20.674 --> 46:21.951
Fine.

46:25.990 --> 46:27.301
My back!

46:28.026 --> 46:29.935
Getting older sucks.

46:29.959 --> 46:33.283
- I'll give you reiki later.
- Vicodin works better.

46:33.307 --> 46:36.321
No amount of Vicodin could
possible help you, Kat.

46:36.345 --> 46:39.634
I don't believe in roach's
phooey mumbo jumbo anyway.

46:39.658 --> 46:42.499
Yeah, like the tablecloth flew
up the table by itself, huh?

46:42.523 --> 46:45.192
Kat: There's a rational
scientific explanation.

46:45.216 --> 46:47.850
It's an old house. The
floor could've shifted.

46:47.874 --> 46:49.644
Okay. Everybody,
just leave me alone.

46:49.668 --> 46:51.232
We cannot just leave
him here like that.

46:51.256 --> 46:52.855
He could attack you
when he wakes up.

46:52.879 --> 46:55.064
At least one of us has
her wits about her.

46:55.088 --> 46:57.193
It's for your own
safety, Lauren.

46:57.711 --> 47:00.058
- Get his tie, bind his legs.
- What?

47:01.232 --> 47:02.692
Just because he's your son,

47:02.716 --> 47:04.970
you don't know what
he is capable of.

47:04.994 --> 47:07.169
Remember, he's also Jake's.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.876
Okay. Everybody, just
give me some time.

47:13.900 --> 47:16.568
Okay. We'll be right
downstairs if you need us.

47:16.592 --> 47:18.249
Okay. Okay. Go!

48:17.342 --> 48:19.482
You got to lay off the booze.

48:20.656 --> 48:23.176
Sorry, roach, I know.

48:33.013 --> 48:35.326
I know what you're thinking.
And we can't.

48:37.604 --> 48:40.824
What's it to you? Why
are you protecting him?

48:40.848 --> 48:43.334
It's not like before.
He's still alive.

48:43.955 --> 48:46.244
This time it would be
cold blooded murder.

48:46.268 --> 48:49.133
I'm not sure I can
go through it again.

48:49.443 --> 48:52.205
But Kat has a point.

48:58.211 --> 49:00.213
- I have to pee.
- Rachel.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.802
I've got to fix my contacts.

49:04.182 --> 49:05.839
Honestly, now?

49:06.322 --> 49:10.292
Honestly, it must be really hard
to be so perfect all the time.

49:15.745 --> 49:16.815
Thank you.

49:40.046 --> 49:42.646
Derek: You killed my father
right here in this house?

49:45.499 --> 49:46.984
Just one thing I need to know.

49:47.915 --> 49:48.986
Lauren: What?

49:49.400 --> 49:51.280
Derek: Would you ever...

49:54.267 --> 49:55.268
Lauren: What?

49:55.785 --> 49:57.832
Derek: Would you ever...

50:07.590 --> 50:09.627
That's not possible.

50:23.468 --> 50:24.573
Derek?

50:30.820 --> 50:32.098
Are you all right?

50:36.895 --> 50:39.553
I'm sorry that Kat hurt you.

50:43.143 --> 50:44.558
And you're going to kill me too?

50:45.594 --> 50:47.423
I'd never let them kill you.

50:48.942 --> 50:50.816
What are you saying,
if I have to die,

50:50.840 --> 50:52.118
you'll do it, or what?

51:02.438 --> 51:05.441
- Could you...
- Mm-hm.

51:07.029 --> 51:09.963
Could you... Will you
ever forgive me?

51:14.243 --> 51:15.624
I don't know.

51:23.287 --> 51:24.426
Now that we've met...

51:26.600 --> 51:28.119
I'm not sure about
anything anymore.

51:31.847 --> 51:34.021
When the house is quiet...

51:34.988 --> 51:39.682
I'll... I'll... I'll untie you

51:39.958 --> 51:42.513
and then you should go, okay?

51:44.963 --> 51:49.278
If I really wanted to get away,
do you think you can stop me?

51:53.627 --> 51:54.628
Then what...

51:58.529 --> 52:00.669
What's the real
reason you came here?

52:03.913 --> 52:05.881
You're more than I
hoped you'd be.

52:07.641 --> 52:08.884
More?

52:11.058 --> 52:12.898
What were you expecting?

52:12.922 --> 52:16.478
Oh, I convinced myself that I
was going up against some...

52:17.513 --> 52:18.928
Evil cougar.

52:20.067 --> 52:21.345
What?

52:24.934 --> 52:27.005
No one should be able to
get away with murder.

52:30.906 --> 52:32.666
The life that I've
been living...

52:33.771 --> 52:36.360
I haven't been able to
get away with anything.

52:57.346 --> 52:58.968
Anna, is that you?

53:15.709 --> 53:16.917
What the hell?

53:29.654 --> 53:31.173
I don't scare that easily.

53:45.567 --> 53:48.155
Oh, my god!

53:51.607 --> 53:57.682
No, no, no, no.

54:06.829 --> 54:10.039
You grew up happy, right?
With good parents?

54:11.869 --> 54:13.042
Maybe.

54:17.461 --> 54:21.119
How did they feel
about you finding me?

54:24.675 --> 54:25.952
They don't know.

54:27.229 --> 54:28.437
Why?

54:29.783 --> 54:33.062
- They're dead.
- What happened?

54:42.969 --> 54:44.350
The house caught on fire...

54:47.042 --> 54:48.630
And I tried to save them.

54:50.977 --> 54:54.670
I tried... but I couldn't.

54:57.190 --> 54:58.536
Smoke...

55:03.058 --> 55:04.266
I couldn't save them.

55:23.837 --> 55:27.393
I hear you, Jake. Speak.

55:31.362 --> 55:35.953
You want me to help her?
Is Lauren in danger?

55:40.198 --> 55:42.925
I know you're here.

55:43.201 --> 55:46.688
If you want to protect
her, give me your message.

56:04.430 --> 56:06.155
You shouldn't have given me up.

56:11.713 --> 56:13.231
I thought...

56:15.717 --> 56:17.073
I thought I just couldn't handle

56:17.097 --> 56:20.145
being reminded of
Jake every day.

56:20.169 --> 56:23.276
Well, you should have been stronger...
for me.

56:23.621 --> 56:24.657
Yeah.

56:24.933 --> 56:26.279
And we would have
had each other.

56:29.351 --> 56:30.663
I'm so sorry.

56:42.088 --> 56:43.296
It's okay.

56:49.958 --> 56:51.936
You won't believe
what I just saw.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.099
I know what you saw.

56:54.514 --> 56:57.206
- What?
- The man you loved.

56:57.483 --> 57:00.175
What are you talking about?
There was no man in there.

57:00.934 --> 57:03.948
I just witnessed
paranormal activity.

57:03.972 --> 57:07.009
Are you kidding me?
You're drunk, Kat.

57:07.493 --> 57:10.299
- Yeah, I know that, but...
- You're all in trouble.

57:10.323 --> 57:13.395
Stop it. This is just
nerves getting to us.

57:14.327 --> 57:15.984
This damn house.

57:16.605 --> 57:19.781
Are you all ready to kill
another innocent young man?

57:20.298 --> 57:22.932
What are you talking about?
We didn't kill anybody.

57:22.956 --> 57:24.061
Lauren killed Jake.

57:25.303 --> 57:26.798
And as far as I'm concerned, she
can do the same thing with.

57:26.822 --> 57:29.318
Mr. "! Don't want your money
just my mommy and daddy."

57:29.342 --> 57:30.940
We are not killing anyone.

57:30.964 --> 57:34.599
I mean, Lauren is in
such an emotional state,

57:34.623 --> 57:36.660
- we have to help her.
- Good.

57:36.970 --> 57:38.420
I'm going to check on her.

57:49.742 --> 57:52.641
Shh! Quiet, quiet, quiet.

57:58.233 --> 58:01.857
- Lauren, is he awake?
- Shh! He's still out cold.

58:02.893 --> 58:04.698
I think he might
go to the police.

58:04.722 --> 58:07.529
- We cannot let that happen.
- Okay. Okay. I know, I know.

58:07.553 --> 58:09.323
Just go downstairs, will you?

58:09.347 --> 58:12.247
Get the girls and help me take
him downstairs to the car.

58:13.559 --> 58:14.984
I'll take care of him.

58:15.008 --> 58:17.839
Lauren, I know how
hard this is for you.

58:18.564 --> 58:21.670
We will do anything to help
you, just like before.

58:22.084 --> 58:26.088
I know. Just go and
help me please.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.685
- Carry me out?
- Okay.

58:37.065 --> 58:39.274
- You have to play dead, okay?
- What?

58:40.482 --> 58:42.529
When they come up
you can't react,

58:42.553 --> 58:43.865
no matter what happens.

58:44.417 --> 58:45.936
How would you save me?

58:46.557 --> 58:49.363
I'll tell them that I put you
in the trunk of the car.

58:49.387 --> 58:51.849
I set it on fire and
I'll push off the cliff.

58:51.873 --> 58:53.495
You really expect
to pull that off?

58:55.255 --> 58:56.567
They think I'm fragile.

58:56.878 --> 58:58.838
They think I'm in the edge
of a nervous breakdown.

58:58.862 --> 59:01.686
- They will do anything I ask.
- All right.

59:01.710 --> 59:05.231
- It's going to be okay.
- I hope so.

59:12.410 --> 59:14.906
- Why did you lock the door?
- Force of habit.

59:14.930 --> 59:16.656
Don't bring up painful memories.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.349
Ready to finally put
it to rest, Lauren?

59:21.074 --> 59:22.662
Just help me bring
him down to the car.

59:24.837 --> 59:25.838
Watch it.

59:26.183 --> 59:28.806
- Why?
- Because I said so.

59:29.324 --> 59:31.015
When did you start
getting all bossy?

59:35.088 --> 59:39.783
He looks just like his
father and Kat's son Ken.

59:40.266 --> 59:41.785
No, he doesn't.

59:42.026 --> 59:44.304
Not all asians look alike.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.444
They could be half-brothers.

59:46.652 --> 59:48.032
Come on. Be careful. Let's go.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.209
Jesus, Buddha, Allah,
I need a drink.

59:52.554 --> 59:54.487
I bet there's bubbly
in the fridge.

59:55.108 --> 59:57.155
Rachel and I will do
a perimeter check.

59:57.179 --> 59:58.739
Make sure the neighbor's
lights are out.

59:58.763 --> 59:59.763
Okay.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.129
Just a little while longer.
Everything I have,

01:00:05.153 --> 01:00:07.880
everything you need,
it's all yours, okay?

01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:13.447
What are you doing,
feeling him up?

01:00:13.471 --> 01:00:16.209
What? What are you implying?

01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:19.995
I'm not implying anything.
I'm just curious.

01:00:20.306 --> 01:00:23.965
You're upstairs, in bed, alone.

01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:27.002
Check out his package?

01:00:27.969 --> 01:00:31.524
- His package?
- Yeah, you know, his junk.

01:00:32.145 --> 01:00:33.215
What?

01:00:34.976 --> 01:00:36.529
He's a good-looking guy.

01:00:37.495 --> 01:00:39.197
I wonder if he takes
after his daddy

01:00:39.221 --> 01:00:41.154
in the downstairs department.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.997
How would you know what's
Jake's downstairs looked like?

01:00:46.021 --> 01:00:48.437
You know, you have
every right to see it.

01:00:48.714 --> 01:00:50.346
If you kept him,
you'd be cleaning

01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.200
the shit and piss off his bits..

01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:56.031
It doesn't mean I want
to see his bits now.

01:00:56.618 --> 01:01:00.184
I'm proud to say my son is huge,

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:05.523
like a fat babies arm. Like...
that big. No joke.

01:01:08.388 --> 01:01:10.090
Oh, my god, Kat,
what are you saying?

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:12.703
Lauren, the coast is clear.

01:01:19.123 --> 01:01:23.828
Okay. Easy. Okay.

01:01:23.852 --> 01:01:25.623
All right. I'll
take care of him.

01:01:25.647 --> 01:01:28.419
I'll take care of all this. Okay.
Don't have to worry.

01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:29.765
- You don't...
- Sure?

01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:31.249
We are already in this together.

01:01:31.273 --> 01:01:33.251
Just let me take
care of this myself.

01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:34.839
We should trust Lauren.

01:01:34.863 --> 01:01:37.314
Whatever. I need to wash.

01:01:38.039 --> 01:01:40.282
Come on, roach, plenty
of bubbly in the fridge.

01:01:42.422 --> 01:01:43.596
All right.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:47.058
Okay. You don't have to worry.

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:49.153
I'll be okay. I'll be
fine, I'll be fine.

01:01:56.678 --> 01:01:58.300
Okay, I'm going
to untie you now.

01:02:01.994 --> 01:02:04.558
- They did listen to you.
- They're my best friends.

01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:06.239
Okay.

01:02:06.792 --> 01:02:08.562
You'll have to get
out of here, okay?

01:02:08.586 --> 01:02:11.738
Just lay low. All right?
Okay, go.

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:14.983
Just get away from here. Stay
low and be careful, okay?

01:02:15.007 --> 01:02:16.180
Kat: Happy ending?

01:02:19.494 --> 01:02:22.059
Mad woman and psychotic
son planning to drive off

01:02:22.083 --> 01:02:23.498
into the sunrise.

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:27.996
- Kat, what are you doing?
- Shut up.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.781
I'm not going to let you choose
him over your best friends.

01:02:33.715 --> 01:02:37.029
Kat, this is my son.

01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:41.309
He's the product of rape
by a man who hated you.

01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:44.830
Jake didn't hate me.

01:02:46.176 --> 01:02:47.625
He loved me.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.353
Jake thought he loved
you, but he never did.

01:02:52.009 --> 01:02:53.217
Not really.

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:55.875
So I'm guessing you're the one.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.567
The one?

01:02:59.396 --> 01:03:01.156
The one that was
cheating with my father.

01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:16.068
Where am I?

01:03:18.311 --> 01:03:21.798
Lauren tried to kill you.
I brought you home.

01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:28.218
- Why?
- You know why.

01:03:36.364 --> 01:03:37.720
She thinks I'm dead?

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:41.093
She wanted you cremated,
but I saved you.

01:03:45.097 --> 01:03:46.695
You're really going
to believe whatever

01:03:46.719 --> 01:03:48.445
this little bastard
says about me?

01:03:49.929 --> 01:03:51.551
He isn't a bastard.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.902
Derek looks like your son Ken...

01:03:58.731 --> 01:04:01.078
And they both have Jake's face.

01:04:03.184 --> 01:04:05.427
I thought it was a coincidence.

01:04:07.947 --> 01:04:08.948
I have a half-brother?

01:04:11.744 --> 01:04:12.883
Yes.

01:04:13.919 --> 01:04:16.922
- Maybe you should meet him.
- I don't think so.

01:04:18.061 --> 01:04:22.375
Kat, what happen to Jake?

01:04:25.413 --> 01:04:27.139
Is he still alive?

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:31.384
Oh, to hell with it.

01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:34.018
♪

01:04:52.164 --> 01:04:53.855
I'm a bad friend.

01:04:56.237 --> 01:04:57.755
I'm a bad husband.

01:04:59.343 --> 01:05:00.620
We're bad people.

01:05:05.971 --> 01:05:07.834
Then again, none
of this counts...

01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:17.361
Because you're dead.

01:05:23.885 --> 01:05:26.439
Oh, baby.

01:05:37.105 --> 01:05:41.144
I bet she never did any of...

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.217
That for you.

01:05:47.529 --> 01:05:49.531
Nope, never did.

01:05:50.187 --> 01:05:52.914
See, I'm better than
her now in every way.

01:05:55.158 --> 01:05:56.538
Not every way.

01:05:59.576 --> 01:06:01.164
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:06.031
You only show up here
when you want sex.

01:06:11.484 --> 01:06:13.659
Well, isn't that
every man's dream?

01:06:15.074 --> 01:06:16.834
- Not mine.
- Oh.

01:06:21.184 --> 01:06:22.599
Come on.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:26.085
You know you mean
everything to me.

01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:29.927
Come on. I doubt that.

01:06:29.951 --> 01:06:31.515
What do you do when
you're out there,

01:06:31.539 --> 01:06:33.265
when you're not up here with me?

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:39.685
I work so I can buy you
whatever the hell you want.

01:06:40.341 --> 01:06:41.549
Cheers.

01:06:46.416 --> 01:06:51.076
Lauren and me, we
could talk for hours.

01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:54.527
She wanted to know me.

01:06:56.805 --> 01:06:58.462
She listened to how I felt.

01:06:59.532 --> 01:07:03.950
She doesn't give a damn
about you or your feelings.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:06.539
She wanted you dead.

01:07:10.371 --> 01:07:13.063
There's really
nobody else but me.

01:07:15.479 --> 01:07:19.656
Don't you ever forget that.

01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:26.801
I made her suffer.

01:07:29.562 --> 01:07:30.805
I deserve to die.

01:07:33.118 --> 01:07:34.326
Well...

01:07:39.469 --> 01:07:41.298
You can leave whenever you want.

01:07:52.344 --> 01:07:54.242
Kat: Oh, yes.

01:08:00.006 --> 01:08:01.870
How long was he with you?

01:08:03.424 --> 01:08:05.529
Long enough to get me pregnant.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:10.269
Not long enough to
fall in love with me.

01:08:10.293 --> 01:08:11.708
Is my father alive or not?

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.173
Hey.

01:08:31.072 --> 01:08:33.970
Babe.

01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:36.871
- What the hell.
- Come back here, stud.

01:08:38.804 --> 01:08:40.908
I got to get out of here.
I had enough.

01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:43.705
Going back to her
like a little bitch?

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:46.743
If she'll have me.

01:08:48.502 --> 01:08:50.022
You're delusional.

01:08:50.367 --> 01:08:52.621
What makes you think
a damaged, little

01:08:52.645 --> 01:08:55.866
goodie two shoes wants
someone like you?

01:08:55.890 --> 01:09:00.283
Look, Lauren is the best
person I know, unlike you,

01:09:00.308 --> 01:09:04.185
- a self-centered, egotistic...
- Okay. Come on.

01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:07.176
If you want to see that, take
a look in the mirror, hm?

01:09:07.419 --> 01:09:09.524
That's right there.
You're so pretty.

01:09:10.594 --> 01:09:13.149
Yeah. That's right.

01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.147
All the more reason I gotta get
back to her, make things right.

01:09:17.774 --> 01:09:20.777
Lauren tried to love me,
but I made it impossible.

01:09:22.675 --> 01:09:26.506
- I'll show her I've changed.
- Oh, you haven't changed.

01:09:26.852 --> 01:09:29.417
You're still the
same pussy-ass loser

01:09:29.441 --> 01:09:31.131
we all know back in high school.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:37.242
I'll see about that. You
and I are finished.

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:40.796
Jake you can't go.

01:09:42.626 --> 01:09:43.868
I'm pregnant.

01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:49.805
It's probably not even mine.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:12.242
I love you.

01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:14.762
I just got to get
back to Lauren.

01:10:15.452 --> 01:10:17.316
Show her she can trust me again.

01:10:18.179 --> 01:10:20.837
God, I love her.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.568
You can't leave us.

01:10:49.797 --> 01:10:51.602
Then, I chopped him up
and threw him away.

01:10:51.626 --> 01:10:52.696
He's dead.

01:10:53.939 --> 01:10:58.702
- Kat, you have to stop.
- Can't do that.

01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:02.361
- He knows too much.
- Stay away from us.

01:11:04.121 --> 01:11:06.883
How could you take his side
against all of us, huh?

01:11:07.677 --> 01:11:10.852
Heroics, from you, really?

01:11:11.197 --> 01:11:14.418
Useless actually. I
simply shoot through you.

01:11:14.442 --> 01:11:17.790
- Leave her alone.
- You get in the car and I will.

01:11:18.032 --> 01:11:19.527
- Fine.
- No.

01:11:19.551 --> 01:11:21.322
- It's okay. It's okay.
- No.

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:23.244
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:28.353
I'm actually sorry Ken will
never a chance to meet you.

01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:32.460
Kat...

01:11:33.841 --> 01:11:38.880
If you kill him... You'll
have to kill me too.

01:11:40.192 --> 01:11:42.539
I'm never going to let
you get away with this.

01:11:43.195 --> 01:11:45.715
And how am I going to
explain all of that, huh?

01:11:47.164 --> 01:11:50.720
Unless I shoot everyone
and blame it on him.

01:11:52.066 --> 01:11:53.688
He's a home intruder.

01:11:55.483 --> 01:11:59.670
Yeah, then I can finally
get rid of all you bitches

01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:01.006
once and for...

01:12:33.452 --> 01:12:35.257
Oh, no.

01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:37.422
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my god.

01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:43.876
So Kat was going to
murder all of us.

01:12:44.774 --> 01:12:47.052
Bitch, please.

01:12:50.711 --> 01:12:52.747
Stay away from my family, bitch.

01:12:53.886 --> 01:12:56.417
Lauren, are you okay?
And you, son?

01:12:56.441 --> 01:12:57.614
Son?

01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:02.526
Wait a minute, Rachel, did
you just say my family?

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:04.897
Yes, I...

01:13:07.106 --> 01:13:08.418
Rachel, what's wrong with you?

01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:11.732
Rachel?

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:16.633
Lauren, you're safe.

01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.501
- Jake?
- What the hell?

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.474
Oh, my head!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.440
Woo!

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.031
What... what happened?

01:13:35.997 --> 01:13:38.459
- You just killed Kat.
- I did?

01:13:38.483 --> 01:13:39.829
Look.

01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:41.382
Oh.

01:13:42.556 --> 01:13:45.327
Oh, the last thing I remember
I was in the bathroom

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:49.942
and... No, it's all coming back.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.015
I was a passenger
in my own body.

01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:56.984
Was I possessed?

01:13:58.019 --> 01:13:59.365
This right here is crazy.

01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:03.439
- Hey, Derek.
- Yeah.

01:14:03.715 --> 01:14:07.201
- You have to go now.
- You want me to leave?

01:14:09.617 --> 01:14:11.792
You were never here, okay?

01:14:12.965 --> 01:14:14.173
- Okay.
- Go.

01:14:18.902 --> 01:14:22.527
Okay. You got to go. Now.

01:14:37.818 --> 01:14:39.475
Do you think he'll
go to the police?

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:42.339
Absolutely not.

01:14:42.892 --> 01:14:44.169
Am we going to jail?

01:14:45.101 --> 01:14:46.343
Absolutely not.

01:14:47.344 --> 01:14:48.898
Do you think he will
ever come back?

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:54.455
Kat's not going to bury herself.

01:15:04.741 --> 01:15:08.676
Anna: Oh, come on, katty,
say something to them.

01:15:09.228 --> 01:15:12.611
Oh, my god. I don't... I
don't wanna be filmed now.

01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:15.614
Okay. Fine.

01:15:16.581 --> 01:15:22.597
Lauren, congratulations. First
one of us to get married.

01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:24.185
I love you.

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:27.453
I hope you and Jake have
a wonderful marriage.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:29.145
Cheers.

01:15:31.803 --> 01:15:32.942
To love.

01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:35.461
All right.

01:15:54.653 --> 01:15:57.598
In a spirit settling
ritual, we share our most

01:15:57.622 --> 01:16:00.048
authentic feelings with the dead

01:16:00.072 --> 01:16:02.948
so that we can help send
them over to the other side.

01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:04.318
Really?

01:16:05.733 --> 01:16:08.401
Do you want Kat to hunt
this house forever?

01:16:08.425 --> 01:16:09.426
No.

01:16:12.429 --> 01:16:14.811
Rachel, for Jake, too.

01:16:27.444 --> 01:16:31.966
Kat, we acknowledge the
evil we have done to you.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:33.830
Forgive us.

01:16:34.831 --> 01:16:36.143
Forgive us.

01:16:36.453 --> 01:16:37.696
Sorry, Kat.

01:16:39.215 --> 01:16:42.149
But you must also acknowledge
the evil that you have done.

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.187
Let your soul rest in peace.

01:16:47.154 --> 01:16:49.225
Be free in the afterlife.

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:58.786
Well, thanks to you, Kat,

01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:01.996
Lauren actually
didn't kill Jake.

01:17:02.687 --> 01:17:04.309
I have to hand it to you.

01:17:04.965 --> 01:17:06.691
You were going to murder us all,

01:17:07.036 --> 01:17:12.628
but instead... you end up
doing us a huge favor.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.670
And we were in love
with the same man.

01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:25.744
So that made us
more than friends.

01:17:27.194 --> 01:17:28.851
You truly made us sisters.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:32.993
I'm sorry I couldn't
lighten your darkness,

01:17:33.441 --> 01:17:35.581
because I was too dark.

01:17:38.412 --> 01:17:41.726
Go on, be one with love.

01:17:45.522 --> 01:17:49.078
Jake, if you have parting
words for Lauren,

01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:51.839
let her receive them in peace.

01:18:16.381 --> 01:18:17.554
It's you.

01:18:21.904 --> 01:18:26.771
Our son... is wonderful.

01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:30.636
He's a miracle.

01:18:34.054 --> 01:18:39.507
And, Jake, I am so grateful
to you for the a gift of him.

01:18:46.135 --> 01:18:50.139
And I forgave you
a long time ago.

01:18:54.315 --> 01:18:55.903
Do you forgive me?

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:01.288
I'll love you forever.

01:19:26.278 --> 01:19:27.452
Did it work?

01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:33.734
Yes.

01:19:40.154 --> 01:19:42.950
Rachel, darling?

01:19:47.196 --> 01:19:50.831
On this day of all hallow's Eve,

01:19:50.855 --> 01:19:54.203
we send the dearly
departed into the light.

01:19:55.376 --> 01:19:56.653
Life is for the living.

01:19:58.517 --> 01:20:03.799
With this breath, we close the
door on the realm of death.
