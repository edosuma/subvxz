00:00.010 --> 00:02.590
I need somewhere to interview
these two for a couple of hours.

00:02.640 --> 00:03.830
Come on.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.790
~ Doris?
~ Just leave me alone.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.230
The field goes to auction
and I'm going to bid.

00:08.280 --> 00:11.150
~ 30,000.
~ Lord Loxley? Sold.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.270
You have no idea what
kind of girl I am.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.160
~ I know that you've been
through some awful things.
~ You don't know anything!

00:19.360 --> 00:21.550
He'll back to you, my dear,
because he loves you.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.430
Maybe that's not enough. I don't
know him any more. He frightens me.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.590
~ Drinking on the street. You're a disgrace!
~ Shut it!

00:31.400 --> 00:33.750
Hey! Hey! Police!

00:33.800 --> 00:36.040
Police!

01:09.840 --> 01:12.630
Doctor! This woman needs help
right away. She's in shock.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.590
~ What's happened?
~ Keep it pressed to the wound.
~ I want Frank.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.440
~ Please. Where's Frank?
~ Come with me.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.750
~ Where's the emergency department?
~ Through there.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.190
Sorry! Excuse me.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.950
~ Harry. Is she all right?
~ She was attacked by some men.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.630
She was cut on her face but it
could have been a lot worse.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.630
Kitty's so strong. I never thought...

01:35.680 --> 01:39.510
~ She can look after herself.
~ The doctor's examined Mrs
Edwards. You can go in now.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.470
I'm her husband.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.470
~ Frank!
~ Oh, Kitty!

01:43.520 --> 01:46.430
Kitty. It's all right, my
darling. It's all right.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.680
It's all right. I'm here
now. It's all right.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.780
It's all right, my love.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.150
Well, he always told me
he's got two left feet.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.560
~ Look at him. Who is she?
~ Violette Selfridge.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.830
Oh. I can't compete with that.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.380
They won't give me a mirror.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.280
~ How bad is it?
~ The doctor says there will
be a scar but it will fade.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.910
~ I want those men found and punished!
~ What are you doing?

02:59.960 --> 03:03.270
~ No! Kitty!
~ I'm going to the police station.
They have to look for them.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.320
You can't go to the station
like that. You need to rest.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.430
Oh!

03:10.480 --> 03:12.350
My coat.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.670
~ It's ruined.
~ Come on. Let's get you back bed.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.920
We'll call the police
as soon as we get home.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.870
Poor Mrs Edwards. It's the
most terrible thing to happen.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.430
At least Frank's with her.
They've got each other.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.590
Yes, it's a blessing.

03:26.640 --> 03:31.230
~ If you hurry, you can still make
the second half of your play.
~ Oh, I don't feel like it now.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.240
Are you hungry?

03:35.600 --> 03:38.800
There's a place I know
just round the corner.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.800
I'd like another glass
of champagne, please.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.950
~ Is that wise?
~ Don't you be a bore like everyone else.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.270
~ You're very pretty.
~ Why, thank you, Mr Colleano.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.790
So pretty that I'd like to kiss you.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.780
Why don't you, then?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.280
Thanks for the dance.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.720
Where are you going?

04:22.840 --> 04:25.870
~ The mutton stew will be good.
~ Mutton stew?

04:25.920 --> 04:28.150
Oh! Is it not one of your favourites?

04:28.200 --> 04:30.680
Er... I'm in your hands.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.120
La-di-da!

04:39.280 --> 04:42.910
Well, the one fortunate thing about
tonight is that you were with me.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.110
You were wonderful with Mrs Edwards.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.430
Well, I nursed during the war,
so I can cope with a little blood.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.030
And pretty much anything
else. Builders, architects -

04:52.080 --> 04:54.550
Spiders. I can't bear spiders.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.070
So you're mortal? How dare you?

04:58.040 --> 05:01.590
Erm, the special, please. Yes?

05:01.640 --> 05:04.590
Two. Thank you.

05:04.640 --> 05:08.280
So how did you get
to be so competent?

05:09.720 --> 05:14.950
Erm, well, both my parents
died when I was very young.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.350
My family's from the north
of England originally

05:17.400 --> 05:21.310
but my eldest brother was working in
London, so I came to stay with him.

05:21.360 --> 05:25.560
I've had to fend for myself
for as long as I can remember.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.320
~ It must have been difficult.
~ It still is, sometimes.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.160
And marriage?

05:36.000 --> 05:40.720
The right man hasn't come along.
I'd rather be alone than compromise.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.120
I admire you. I'm not
much good on my own.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.920
~ To the Selfridge Estate.
~ Friendship.

06:02.960 --> 06:07.630
Well, it's going to be difficult,
now that we've lost the land.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.710
The aerodrome is where
I saw us making the money.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.510
We could look for more land.
South London is a possibility.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.750
~ Oh, I never go south of the river.
~ Lord Loxley, be serious.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.270
I need to know your intentions.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.990
All right, then. I'm out.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.230
Let's be honest, Serge.
You're not an aviator.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.590
You're just a playboy living off
Harry Selfridge's expense account,

06:31.640 --> 06:33.870
if he's got anything
left after that auction.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.910
So this was all about you pushing
up the price on that field.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.950
The Selfridge Estate?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.750
The man is naming London
after himself.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.510
Aviation is the future and
my aeroplane will get built.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.390
Not by me.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.680
Goodbye, Mr De Bolotoff.

07:16.280 --> 07:20.160
~ How did you get in here?
~ My father has a desk a bit like this.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.800
But yours has much more
amusing things on it.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.720
~ You should go.
~ Do you really want me to?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.720
Yes.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.380
I don't believe you.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.190
If you want a boyfriend or you're
looking for love, I'm a bad bet.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.470
~ Did someone break your heart?
~ I mean it. I've got nothing to give.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.160
I'm not in the market for love.
More trouble than it's worth.

08:05.680 --> 08:11.720
A little excitement - you're not
going to deny me that, are you?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.280
There you are.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.510
~ Where have you been?
~ Can't a man have a bit of privacy?

08:58.560 --> 09:01.030
~ You've been drinking.
~ Mm.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.840
Astute of you.

09:04.480 --> 09:09.590
~ Is this about Pa buying the land?
~ Why does everything always
have to be about him?

09:09.640 --> 09:13.470
When I married you, I didn't think
I'd be living under his roof,

09:13.520 --> 09:15.560
dancing to his tune.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.040
~ I'm good for more than that.
~ I never said you weren't.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.560
Darling.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.440
I'm going to bed.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.910
You're not regretting it, are you?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.070
Us being married?

09:40.120 --> 09:44.720
I don't know. I don't
know anything any more.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.790
Miss Selfridge is just leaving.

10:03.840 --> 10:07.240
But Miss Selfridge will
be coming back tomorrow.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.800
You play with Violette Selfridge
and there'll be consequences.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.710
Well, that was actually rather good.

10:21.760 --> 10:25.870
~ How did you find the place?
~ Well, I usually come in the morning.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.470
They make the most
delicious Chelsea buns.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.110
~ Oh!
~ Excuse us. I'm going to call you a cab.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.310
~ No, my flat's close. I'll walk.
~ Well, you shouldn't.

10:34.360 --> 10:38.440
~ Look at what happened
to Mrs Edwards tonight.
~ Just a couple of rotten apples.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.950
I had a lovely time with you tonight.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.510
Thank you.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.430
Well...

10:47.480 --> 10:49.020
Good night.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.080
Agnes.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.100
Henri hasn't come back?

11:02.120 --> 11:05.630
You can't wait up all night for him,
Agnes. You must get some sleep.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.390
Come on.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.280
Why isn't he coming
home? Where is he?

11:54.480 --> 11:58.590
He was... touching me.

11:58.640 --> 12:03.120
I... And I hit him, to
try and get him to stop.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.560
And then he... he hit me.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.040
He slammed me into the wall.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.120
And then he pinned me to the floor.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.310
He pushed my...

12:30.360 --> 12:32.560
Pushed my skirt right up.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.440
Told his friend to keep watch.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.750
And that's when Mr Selfridge came.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.920
If... if... if he hadn't have come...

12:53.680 --> 12:56.280
Can you describe this ringleader?

12:56.680 --> 12:58.440
Tall.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.800
Young.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.240
Ex-military. I've seen him before.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.430
~ Where?
~ Outside the store.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.160
Selling cigarettes.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.190
And another thing.

13:21.240 --> 13:24.520
He'd been drinking.
His friend had, too.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.910
Drink! If I had my way, I'd
ban the stuff entirely.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.910
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

13:31.960 --> 13:34.830
With all due respect, sir, I've
seen the damage it causes.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.990
They must have got their
drink from somewhere local.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.780
Illegally, no doubt. We'll find out.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.600
Henri.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.190
~ I came to say I'm sorry about the window.
~ Oh, it doesn't matter.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.070
It does.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.470
~ Oh, we're going to take a walk.
~ Very good, sir.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.280
I was in a fort outside Verdun.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.800
The Germans besieged us.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.840
We ran out of food and water and...

14:16.120 --> 14:18.790
.. only eight of us came out alive.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.480
I'm so sorry.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.600
If there's anything I can do.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.870
I can't be in the store any
more, not after what happened.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.390
We need you. I need you.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.040
But if I can't trust myself,
how can you trust me?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.720
~ Anyway, Mrs Leclair wouldn't
want to work beside me.
~ Of course she would.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.800
She's frightened of me.
I heard her say it.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.760
My own Agnes.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.670
~ You must make her understand
what you're going through.
~ I can't!

14:59.720 --> 15:02.190
You have to! You must tell her.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.310
~ Let her know what's going on.
~ Tell her what?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.830
That she's married to a coward?

15:08.600 --> 15:12.720
My men died all around me,
one by one. I watched them.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.120
And I...

15:17.560 --> 15:19.920
What? You what?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.280
I lived.

15:31.040 --> 15:33.870
~ You think the Inspector will find them?
~ Of course.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.460
Seems an efficient fellow to me.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.110
There you are.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.680
I'm glad you were there when they
were asking me those questions.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.870
I couldn't have done it without you.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.270
Kitty, are you sure it's those men

15:54.320 --> 15:58.020
who've been selling cigarettes
outside Selfridge's?

15:58.400 --> 16:00.870
Positive.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.920
Why? What is it?

16:06.160 --> 16:08.550
You might want to be a bit careful.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.510
The press have been getting worked
up about our ex-servicemen.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.720
Some people think they've
been given a rough deal.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.670
You're not saying I
should let this drop?

16:18.720 --> 16:22.510
No, I just... It could
become very unpleasant.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.800
They hurt me! They're
going to pay for it.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.310
Oi! Watch him! He's going
to make a run for it.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.080
Come on! Round them up. Quickly,
men, round them up.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.040
Get them in the van. Quickly, there.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.710
~ Come on.
~ Come along, my dear. Come on. Let's go in.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.840
Quickly, now.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.510
~ What's happening here?
~ We're moving these people on.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.910
I'm Chief Inspector
Johnson, Mr Selfridge.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.920
~ I'm running the investigation
into the attack on Mrs Edwards.
~ Thank you.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.560
Come on, then. Get a move on.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.950
There was a group of men
and they attacked Kitty!

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
~ Her face is really bad!
~ What's going on?

17:24.920 --> 17:27.869
The problem is so many
of these men are unstable.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.310
~ One doesn't know what
they're going to do next.
~ They're out of control.

17:31.360 --> 17:35.390
~ On our doorsteps, as well.
~ It was bad enough when Mr
Leclair smashed up the window.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.740
Back to your posts, please. The
store opens in five minutes.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.790
What does Pa mean,
I can't go out alone?

17:45.840 --> 17:48.510
It's natural that your father
wants to protect you.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.710
He wants to keep me locked up so I never meet
anyone. I might as well live in a nunnery.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.070
I'm not sure they'd
have you, my dear.

17:55.120 --> 17:58.750
You're always here. Haven't
you got anywhere else to go?

17:58.800 --> 18:02.590
~ Rosalie, darling, where's my scamp of a son?
~ In his study.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.110
I'll go and have a little chat.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.550
When are you going back to
your own flat, Princess?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.270
~ The repairs seem to be taking quite a while.
~ Builders!

18:09.320 --> 18:11.430
They say this week, then the next.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.350
In the meantime, Harry's
footing your hotel bill.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.800
Isn't he an absolute darling?

18:20.680 --> 18:22.910
Two bad pennies do
not a fistful make,

18:22.960 --> 18:25.990
just because these particular
men were vicious.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.270
I agree with Mr Crabb completely.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.030
I want you to remember that our servicemen
have had terrible experiences.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.430
~ There is concern for
security inside the store.
~ Well, that's ridiculous.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.830
There was a recent incident of
aggression in one of the departments.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.270
Er, the young man who
accosted Mrs Grove.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.150
What? What happened?

18:44.200 --> 18:47.710
Er, a young man approached
her, pulled her arm.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.070
~ Did she not tell you?
~ No.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.950
The newspapers say there are
thieves operating in the area.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.550
I want all of our staff to feel safe.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.870
~ We need young men, giving the
appearance of customers, patrolling.
~ That's an excellent idea.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.150
A security team. Thank
you, Miss Mardle.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.270
Can you look into it, Mr Grove?
Thank you all very much.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.520
Mrs Leclair, can I speak to you
for a second? Have a seat, please.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.750
Henri came to see me this morning.

19:18.160 --> 19:21.030
Er... I've been
so worried about him.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.750
He hasn't been home for three days.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.910
Why is he avoiding me?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.630
I think...

19:28.680 --> 19:32.950
because he lost control in
the window, he feels ashamed.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.990
But more than that, he...
he survived and his men died

19:37.040 --> 19:38.910
and he feels responsible.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.960
~ That makes no sense.
~ But it does to him.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.280
~ Have you brought it up with him?
~ I've tried.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.070
But he won't talk to me.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.350
Make him.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.920
I don't...

19:55.440 --> 19:57.510
I don't know if I can.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.070
He... He's so different
from the man that he was.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.590
No. Underneath it all,
he's still the same Henri.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.910
He needs you now more than ever.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.680
Don't give up on him.

20:12.920 --> 20:17.430
A young lady was attacked yesterday evening
just down the street from here.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.510
~ I heard.
~ She said the men who
attacked her were drunk.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.510
I've also got a witness says

20:22.560 --> 20:27.550
he saw some men leaving this
club around six, drunk as lords.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.870
Well, your witness got it wrong.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.190
It's not worth my licence or
my time to open before six.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.430
If you're lying to me, I'll have
this place closed down so fast

20:36.480 --> 20:38.950
you won't know what's hit you.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.760
Come on, Purkiss.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.590
Good to meet you, Mr Colleano.

20:49.960 --> 20:54.150
~ So that's Purkiss's boss.
~ Doesn't have much to say
when he's around, does he?

20:54.200 --> 20:56.840
~ Victor.
~ What's the matter?

20:58.120 --> 21:01.990
Frank Edwards was here yesterday
afternoon, drinking,

21:02.040 --> 21:05.520
with two ex-servicemen - your
chums, Charlie and Silas.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.950
~ What's the matter with Rosalie?
~ We had an argument.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.550
An argument? Serge, you have
to be more thoughtful.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.830
Until your plane gets made, we're
living on Selfridge generosity.

21:32.880 --> 21:34.910
My plane is never going to get made.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.320
Loxley was just using
me to get at Harry.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.110
What a despicable man.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.190
I was preparing these for him.
There's not much point now.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.390
No, Serge! Stop, stop, stop!

21:49.440 --> 21:51.750
Darling, cheer up!

21:51.800 --> 21:56.040
We'll think of something. We'll
find you another investor.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.760
It's not just the investment.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.310
I need £80.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.030
Bad luck with the cards last night.

22:08.280 --> 22:12.190
I don't have it. In fact,
I was going to ask you.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.270
Oh! Don't tell me you're down
to your last shilling again.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.790
~ Borrow it off Rosalie. She won't mind.
~ I won't beg from my wife.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.270
God, Mother - do you have no pride?

22:21.320 --> 22:23.710
I can't afford it. Neither can you.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.270
Mm. We're parasites
living off dreams.

22:27.320 --> 22:32.600
We are no such thing. The blood
of Count Rurik runs in our veins.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.280
I'll get you your money.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.240
Hello, Henri.

23:11.800 --> 23:15.150
What are you doing here?
You should be at work.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.030
We have to talk.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.750
It's too late.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.790
When we argued in the window, I could
have done anything - even hurt you.

23:24.840 --> 23:27.080
You must not be with me.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.630
We made a vow. In sickness
and in health.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.150
So you are here out of duty.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.870
I'm here because I know
what happened in Verdun.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.860
~ I don't want to discuss it.
~ Well, I do.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.680
Why... why do you think
that it was your fault?

23:46.320 --> 23:48.360
They were my men.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.150
I should have done something.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.240
~ What could you have done?
~ Found them water.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.000
There was no water. You couldn't
have done anything.

24:05.520 --> 24:09.270
I'm haunted by them, Agnes.
I see them everywhere.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.990
They feel more real to me than you.

24:12.600 --> 24:14.540
No-one can help me.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.680
Please, my love.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.800
Let me try.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.910
You're to mingle on the shop
floor, surreptitiously.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.790
You're not to reveal to anyone
that you are store security -

24:49.840 --> 24:51.550
staff or customers.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.990
And remember - this is an experiment.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.390
Let's see if you can make it to the end
of the day without being discovered.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.750
To your stations, gentlemen.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.200
The very best of luck to you.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.190
A shilling that by lunchtime
the whole operation's a bust.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.750
You're on.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.150
Look who's come to visit.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.190
~ Victor.
~ Hello, Kitty.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.670
I'm afraid this isn't
just a social visit.

25:22.720 --> 25:26.400
It's about the servicemen you
brought into the club yesterday.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.800
What servicemen?

25:33.280 --> 25:35.590
No? Try this one.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.520
~ Ooh!
~ I have another one you can try.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.430
Er, I... I'm so sorry. I've...

26:02.480 --> 26:04.630
~ I've changed my mind.
~ Oh! All right.

26:04.680 --> 26:06.360
Thank you.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.790
How are you? I know everyone's
a bit shaken up.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.110
Oh. I'm almost scared
to walk home tonight.

26:19.160 --> 26:25.150
Then don't. We've been saying
we'll go out for ages, so let's.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.280
Oh! Very well.

26:28.840 --> 26:31.380
~ I'll see you this evening.
~ Yes.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.710
I bought them drinks
to loosen their tongues.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.670
I had no idea they
might be dangerous.

26:40.720 --> 26:45.120
~ Why didn't you tell me?
~ We can't be sure it was Charlie and Silas.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.350
What did they look like?

26:48.400 --> 26:52.630
One was tall and fair.
He was the leader.

26:52.680 --> 26:57.880
And the other one was smaller.
A strange face, not quite right.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.800
Right. It sounds like them.

27:08.280 --> 27:10.750
Charlie Copperstone. Always
was a mean bugger.

27:10.800 --> 27:15.480
Silas, he's all right, though.
Not all there in the head, though.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.710
Do you know where to find them?

27:20.760 --> 27:23.750
They did say they were sleeping rough

27:23.800 --> 27:27.070
in some old cellar down by the river.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.660
You need to go to the Inspector.

27:31.840 --> 27:35.950
What if we do this anonymously?
Ring through with the information?

27:36.000 --> 27:39.310
~ They might not take it seriously.
~ Do you know how much trouble we're in?

27:39.360 --> 27:44.280
Your club will be closed down.
I treated these men to drinks out
of hours. I could go to prison.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.880
Kitty, I...

27:50.600 --> 27:52.270
Wait. Don't...

27:52.840 --> 27:57.990
You'd save your own skin
before mine? How could you?

27:58.040 --> 27:59.800
Kitty, wait!

28:09.760 --> 28:12.950
He had an argument with Lord Loxley,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.590
who's pulled out of
investing in the plane.

28:15.640 --> 28:17.880
Why didn't Serge say?

28:19.000 --> 28:22.710
I know Serge seems confident
but underneath...

28:22.760 --> 28:28.110
He's led a strange life. He
hasn't known where he belongs.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.440
During your engagement, though,
I've never seen him so happy.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.470
But since we've been married?

28:35.520 --> 28:38.950
It's been difficult for him,
living under Harry's roof

28:39.000 --> 28:41.230
and now, with the Loxley thing...

28:41.280 --> 28:46.830
So the silly boy gambles and
loses rather a lot of money.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.040
~ What?
~ Which he hasn't got to hand at the moment.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.800
He doesn't know what to
do or... who to turn to.

29:05.520 --> 29:10.440
~ It's so beautiful.
~ We'll take both dresses.
~ Very good.

29:18.320 --> 29:22.120
Excuse me. Is there anything
you'd actually like to purchase?

29:24.080 --> 29:28.430
~ I shall get my assistant to measure
your daughter. Excuse me.
~ You've been looking for ages.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.630
So, if not, you might want to
move on to another department.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.350
Is there anything the matter?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.870
That pervert has been hanging
around the nightwear.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.510
~ I saw him off.
~ Mm-hm.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.510
Would you go and measure the young
lady, please, Miss Hawkins?

29:42.560 --> 29:45.760
Try not to see her off,
won't you? Thank you.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.030
Doris! How lovely to see you.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.310
Why did you tell Roger about what
happened with that young man?

29:56.360 --> 29:59.950
~ You shouldn't have said anything.
~ I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.040
Well, you have. Keep your
nose out of my marriage.

30:07.880 --> 30:11.920
~ We talked, really talked.
~ That's good.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.270
He's at home. The doctor gave him
some medicine so that he can sleep.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.270
Mm.

30:18.320 --> 30:24.590
But I don't think he should come
back to work, Mr Selfridge,

30:24.640 --> 30:26.950
and I'm handing in my notice, too.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.230
Really? That's very sudden.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.910
I never thought I could
give all of this up but...

30:31.960 --> 30:34.960
he's more important
to me than anything.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.990
And that's why I've decided
that we have to leave,

30:38.040 --> 30:41.390
not just the store - London.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.480
It's too busy. He needs
to be somewhere quiet.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.280
Mm.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.920
~ I've known you a long time.
~ Ever since I sold you those gloves.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.910
You were a shop girl then.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.710
~ Look at you now.
~ Well, it's down to you.

31:00.760 --> 31:05.270
~ Well...
~ You changed my life, gave me opportunities.

31:05.320 --> 31:07.790
You reached out and took them.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.950
Oh!

31:19.000 --> 31:20.590
~ Arthur.
~ Mildred.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.950
~ Are you all right?
~ That man has not stopped looking at me

31:25.000 --> 31:28.200
and following me in the
most sinister fashion.

31:30.520 --> 31:35.310
My dear, let me explain. We have
some new covert security measures.

31:35.360 --> 31:39.670
No, no, no, no. These gloves aren't
right. What did I tell you?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.310
A place for everything and
everything in its place.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.080
To work in accessories is to work in the
most exacting department in the whole store.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.750
Mrs Leclair! Can I help
you with something?

31:50.800 --> 31:54.430
I just remember when Miss
Mardle gave me that speech.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.550
~ Oh!
~ I started in accessories when I wasn't
much older than your assistant.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.550
And look where you are now.
You're an example to us all.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.320
I don't know about that, but I
have had a wonderful time of it.

32:07.560 --> 32:10.760
Well, keep up the good
work, Miss Calthorpe.

32:51.440 --> 32:55.510
~ We had a bet, Mr Crabb.
~ Which I won.
~ Oh, come now!

32:55.560 --> 32:57.870
I think the new security
team did rather well.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.670
Mrs Crabb wouldn't agree.

32:59.720 --> 33:03.390
Well, she was lingering
in a suspicious fashion.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.390
She was merely taking her time.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.550
One of my assistants was
also made aware of them.

33:07.600 --> 33:10.990
~ The problem is men in women's departments.
~ I wonder...

33:11.040 --> 33:13.580
Should we add women to the team?

33:14.360 --> 33:18.230
The loading bay workers are strong.
They could deal with an incident.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.710
~ They'd also fit in.
~ It's a very good idea, Mr Crabb.

33:21.760 --> 33:26.080
I think the chief would like it,
too. I'll run it by him tomorrow.

33:29.280 --> 33:33.280
~ Did Mrs Grove enjoy choosing
dresses for her birthday?
~ Very much.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.560
Thank you for your help.

33:39.480 --> 33:43.630
~ And the incident with the young man?
~ Oh, that was nothing.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.880
Apparently, he mistook
her for someone else.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.070
Disused cellars down by the river.

33:57.400 --> 34:01.350
~ Ring any bells with you, Purkiss?
~ There's some by Chelsea Wharf, sir.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.670
We'll go down there tonight.
I'll need Mrs Edwards to come.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.590
She'll have to identify
her attackers.

34:10.760 --> 34:14.360
~ You could have told us this earlier.
~ I didn't put two and two together.

34:15.840 --> 34:20.750
~ Really?
~ I'm not very proud of
myself about any of this,

34:20.800 --> 34:23.670
so could we get on with it? I presume
you're going to charge me.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.110
The important thing is
to track these men down,

34:26.159 --> 34:28.960
then I'll decide what to do with you.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.389
~ Morning.
~ Morning.
~ Can you see that Lord Marchant gets this?

34:35.440 --> 34:38.270
~ It's from Mr Serge De Bolotoff.
~ Yes, ma'am.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.870
I knew he had a bad night,

34:40.920 --> 34:44.790
but to get his wife to pay
his debts for him? Bad show.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.030
That's what wives do, Lord Loxley,

34:47.080 --> 34:49.480
if they love their husbands.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.630
Your new husband has told me some very
interesting things about your family.

34:55.679 --> 35:00.550
I wonder, did he do that
out of love for you?

35:00.600 --> 35:04.400
Leave my husband and my family alone.

35:08.200 --> 35:12.280
I have a list of architects here and there's
a couple that I particularly recommend.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.350
Harry?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.510
~ Harry?
~ Yeah, I'm sorry. You were saying?

35:19.560 --> 35:23.760
Well, you're preoccupied. This
obviously isn't a good time.

35:24.240 --> 35:27.950
My deputy and head of design
are leaving. I just heard.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.710
They must be replaceable - so
many talented people in London.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.080
No, he's my best friend and she's...

35:36.400 --> 35:39.030
~ She's like a daughter to me.
~ Oh, Harry.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.280
Losing them both at once.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.590
It's so good to have you to talk to.

35:47.640 --> 35:50.310
Since my wife died I've had no-one.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.710
Please, stop.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.040
Just, please stop.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.510
I know you don't want to be alone.

36:00.560 --> 36:04.630
I like you, Harry, but you can't just look
to the closest person to fill the void.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.990
No, no, it's not like that.
You've got it all wrong.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.950
I-I don't think I have.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.840
~ Please, can't we just forget
this conversation ever happened?
~ Nancy, please!
~ It's all right.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.830
Do you have happy memories
of your childhood?

36:28.880 --> 36:31.080
Yes, I do.

36:32.200 --> 36:36.840
When you're a child, you can't imagine
anything will ever go wrong.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.640
And the house where you
grew up, what's it like?

36:47.720 --> 36:49.520
Big.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.200
Grey stone, white shutters.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.950
It's by the sea.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.190
The horizon goes on forever.
Huge skies, empty beaches.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.980
You can walk all day and see nobody.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.560
Let's go there.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.110
Go? But we can't just leave London.

37:20.160 --> 37:23.950
~ I've handed in my notice.
~ No.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.350
No, Agnes, I won't have you
sacrificing yourself for me.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.510
It's out of the question.

37:28.560 --> 37:31.960
~ Everything you've built...
~ Is nothing without you.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.800
And when we're not together,
we're not... whole.

37:39.440 --> 37:42.350
I want to make you better,

37:42.400 --> 37:45.600
and there's nothing more
important than that.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.270
Are you sure?

37:48.320 --> 37:49.750
I'm sure.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.400
Then, yes, I'd love to go home...

37:54.480 --> 37:56.790
.. and show it all to you.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.120
So it's decided.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.760
What if I don't get better?

38:08.360 --> 38:10.670
You will.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.040
It might take a long time.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.280
Well, we've got all
the time in the world.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.590
~ Look at me!
~ Who's that?

38:33.640 --> 38:35.510
Is that him?

38:35.560 --> 38:39.320
~ What? What is it?
~ Get your face uncovered. Let me see.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.590
~ You! Wake up!
~ What?

38:44.640 --> 38:46.880
Put your face up. Up!

38:48.000 --> 38:50.390
Look at me!

38:50.440 --> 38:52.310
Wake up! Wake up!

38:52.360 --> 38:54.790
What is this? What is this?

38:54.840 --> 38:57.240
Oi, you! Come on! Look at me.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.320
~ Leave me alone.
~ Look at me!
~ Oh, come on.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.910
~ Oi!
~ No! What?
~ That's him. That's one of them.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.720
Up you get.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.070
Stop him!

39:15.120 --> 39:17.790
~ He's going round the back!
~ Stop! Police!

39:17.840 --> 39:22.310
Don't touch me! Get off me! Get
your hands off me, you scum!

39:22.360 --> 39:26.950
Look at me! What's wrong with you?
We're left to rot down here.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.840
Stand here.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.310
~ That's the ringleader. That's him.
~ Take him away.

39:34.360 --> 39:36.880
Get off! Get off!

39:37.920 --> 39:41.320
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.470
Well? Was it them?

39:50.520 --> 39:55.000
They locked them up for the night.
They'll charge them tomorrow.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.470
There were lots of them down there.

40:03.640 --> 40:07.390
Makes you wonder where
their families are,

40:07.440 --> 40:09.440
their friends.

40:10.360 --> 40:13.390
You don't need to worry about
all that. Let's get you to bed.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.760
I... need to be alone tonight.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.470
I'm sorry, Kitty.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.960
I should have told you
before but I panicked.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.750
Please...

40:26.800 --> 40:28.600
Not tonight.

41:12.080 --> 41:15.990
~ What are you doing here?
~ I could say the same to you.

41:16.040 --> 41:20.430
~ Does Pa know you're out on your own?
~ Yes, as it happens.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.670
He didn't like it but there
was nothing he could do.

41:23.720 --> 41:27.030
~ Have we met?
~ This is Grace Calthorpe.

41:27.080 --> 41:30.320
~ Accessories.
~ Of course!

41:31.280 --> 41:33.630
Stay with us. We've...
We've got a table.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.670
I don't need a chaperone.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.920
Have fun, little brother.

41:49.600 --> 41:53.000
I had no idea your sister
was going to be here.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.630
Mr Purkiss. What can I do for you?

42:06.680 --> 42:09.510
You shouldn't have come
down to the station.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.750
You'll draw attention to yourself.
Johnson will have his eye on you now.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.590
Well, good luck to him. I'm
going to play it by the book.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.510
No more drinking after hours
and no more bungs to you.

42:18.560 --> 42:21.110
You wouldn't last a month.

42:21.160 --> 42:24.750
We've got regulars. They come here
for the music, not the drink.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.590
~ I'll make it work.
~ Not if I've got anything to do with it.

42:27.640 --> 42:31.680
~ You've had your blood money. Call it quits.
~ You don't get it, do you?

42:32.600 --> 42:35.540
It's me that chooses
when to walk away.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.430
You haven't heard the last of this.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.230
George.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.150
Have a safe journey. I will
miss you terribly, Agnes.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.710
~ Make sure you write to me.
~ Come here.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.560
Thank you for everything.
Take good care of yourself.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.510
~ It will be all right.
~ I hope so.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.310
I know so. You have each other.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.430
It's true. I'm lucky.

43:15.480 --> 43:19.640
Thank you, Harry. Thank you for
everything you've done for me.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.470
~ All aboard!
~ Henri, we have to go.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.520
All aboard.

44:01.280 --> 44:03.750
We're going to miss them.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.000
Don't know what I'm going
to do without her.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.280
It's all right.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.420
Home, Mr Selfridge?

44:36.960 --> 44:38.680
Not just yet.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.640
~ Harry!
~ Can I come in?
~ Is something the matter?

44:55.440 --> 44:57.070
What is it?

44:57.120 --> 45:00.990
You know something? You should
have more faith in yourself.

45:01.040 --> 45:04.990
~ What are you talking about?
~ Is this the way you treat every
man that makes a pass at you?

45:05.040 --> 45:07.550
Because if so, no wonder
you're still single.

45:07.600 --> 45:11.480
~ Excuse me?
~ I don't want any woman
by my side. I want you.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.590
You're clever and funny and brave.

45:15.640 --> 45:19.670
And you're also a little...
cross and defensive,

45:19.720 --> 45:21.470
but even when you're
angry I like you.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.470
And I love it when you frown

45:23.520 --> 45:28.150
because those little lines right
there, well, they're sweet.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.600
And I love it when you smile.

45:31.160 --> 45:35.160
Those little dimples, well,
they just have to be kissed.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.400
We shouldn't. We really shouldn't.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.230
A conviction would mean a fine, possibly
a prison sentence with hard labour.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.870
I don't suppose you're going
to tell me what you're up to?

46:03.920 --> 46:05.550
Enhancing my reputation.

46:05.600 --> 46:07.550
He's a profiteer, have
they they forgotten?

46:07.600 --> 46:10.390
I love this country and building
those houses will prove that.

46:10.440 --> 46:15.000
~ You've got a reputation to
think of and not just yours.
~ I'd rather be shameful than spineless.
