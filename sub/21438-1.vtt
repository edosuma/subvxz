And blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

00:11.605 --> 00:15.673
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

00:15.859 --> 00:18.843
now and at
the hour of our death.

00:18.979 --> 00:20.913
Amen.

00:27.089 --> 00:29.189
Are you coming?

00:32.073 --> 00:35.159
- Cora?
- Come here, Cora.

00:36.132 --> 00:37.581
Cora?

00:57.868 --> 01:01.026
Well, once I put the order in,
it usually takes about a week.

01:01.565 --> 01:03.237
No,
that's for the order to come in.

01:03.299 --> 01:05.400
We just need a day for the installation.

01:05.627 --> 01:08.595
No, I won't be there myself,
but I promise you

01:08.646 --> 01:10.784
he'll do a great job,
and you'll be nice and cool

01:10.822 --> 01:12.702
for the rest of the summer.
How does that sound?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.224
I'm... I'm sorry, what...

01:19.271 --> 01:21.435
yeah, yes, that's right.

01:21.471 --> 01:22.747
See you later, man.
I'm staying in tonight.

01:22.783 --> 01:26.896
All right, great, well, I will be in
contact with you next week to confirm.

01:27.001 --> 01:29.083
Okay, thanks, Ms. Rosas.

01:29.134 --> 01:32.404
Yep, all right. Okay, bye.

01:32.775 --> 01:34.208
I'm still waiting on
that quote from Anna,

01:34.244 --> 01:35.911
so I wasn't able to
finish the O'Neil list.

01:35.981 --> 01:37.472
- Come here, babe.
- Come on, stop.

01:37.553 --> 01:40.378
- You did the Jacksons?
- Yeah, it's in there.

01:40.481 --> 01:41.600
That's all we need.

01:41.654 --> 01:43.115
Dad, I'm gonna 
go home and wash up.

01:43.151 --> 01:44.777
I'll meet you there, all right?

01:45.034 --> 01:46.715
I know, I'm leaving too.

01:46.776 --> 01:48.456
I got to say, these look good.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.871
Pretty soon, I won't even
need to come into work.

02:00.218 --> 02:01.584
I don't think you have the guts.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.504
- Oh, no fun.
- Well, then, do it.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.573
Do it... prove me wrong.

02:05.686 --> 02:07.559
Well, maybe I will.

02:08.276 --> 02:10.148
Mason, we're with your dad
all day long,

02:10.183 --> 02:12.283
and then it's dinner with the
two of them every night.

02:12.318 --> 02:14.165
- Yeah.
- And I... I just don't think

02:14.212 --> 02:16.145
it's the end of the world
if we ask for a night off.

02:16.185 --> 02:18.665
- All right, all right.
- Or two, even.

02:18.701 --> 02:20.037
You're right, you're right.

02:23.063 --> 02:24.296
- I just...
- Oh, my God.

02:24.332 --> 02:26.686
No, listen, no, come on,
I just think it's weird to come home

02:26.722 --> 02:29.797
and just take Lane from Mom
after she's watched him all day,

02:29.862 --> 02:31.080
cooked us dinner.

02:31.116 --> 02:32.836
Having dinner with us is
her reward, you know?

02:32.962 --> 02:35.227
Just feels mean to do that.

02:35.638 --> 02:37.098
- You're such a mama's boy.

02:37.134 --> 02:38.657
- Oh, come on, stop saying that.
- You are.

02:38.693 --> 02:40.680
I hate... I hate that term.

02:44.735 --> 02:46.554
- Oh, finally.

02:46.758 --> 02:48.855
- There's my sweet pea.
- Hey, Mom.

02:48.891 --> 02:50.110
Hi, baby.

02:50.718 --> 02:52.504
- Hi, pokey.
- Smells great.

02:52.649 --> 02:54.206
Hi, let me get you out of there.

02:54.287 --> 02:56.813
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He hasn't finished his dinner.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.563
I told him he could get down as
soon as he finishes his food

02:59.703 --> 03:03.633
because those are the rules,
sweetheart, right?

03:04.258 --> 03:06.766
What did you do with
Grandma today?

03:07.816 --> 03:09.415
- What's the spread?
- 4 1/2.

03:09.503 --> 03:10.769
4 1/2?

03:10.805 --> 03:12.657
- With who, Manny?
- Yeah.

03:12.747 --> 03:14.747
Oh, God.

03:14.830 --> 03:16.395
- What an idiot.
- I know, but if you want in,

03:16.431 --> 03:17.559
you should call him right now.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.160
- All right, see you later, Mom.
- Bye.

03:19.401 --> 03:21.149
Good night, Lane.

03:27.709 --> 03:30.143
Hey, I'll feed him tomorrow
if you two want to sleep in.

03:30.178 --> 03:32.145
Mom, I love you. Bye, Mom.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.012
It's Friday night.

04:10.207 --> 04:12.012
Oh, I don't know.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.723
What?

04:13.983 --> 04:15.750
I thought you said you
were feeling better.

04:15.858 --> 04:18.043
I... I...

04:18.499 --> 04:21.233
I am. I'm just...

04:26.468 --> 04:28.134
Okay.

04:30.739 --> 04:32.138
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:32.173 --> 04:34.941
- Yeah, just give me a minute.
- Yeah?

04:37.042 --> 04:40.739
I just... I just need a minute.
I just need a minute.

04:41.850 --> 04:45.284
Okay. Okay.

04:49.344 --> 04:51.168
See what you do to me?

04:53.151 --> 04:54.465
I'll be right in.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.814
- Oh!
-Ah!

05:25.056 --> 05:26.426
Oh, like that?

05:26.461 --> 05:27.931
Like that?

05:28.329 --> 05:30.697
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:20.382 --> 06:21.712
- Hey.
- Um.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.644
It's gonna be crowded.
I want to get a good spot.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.548
All right.

06:27.806 --> 06:31.215
Oh, by the way, I told
Mom that we'd... come over

06:31.251 --> 06:33.751
for dinner tonight
after we go swimming.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.611
What do you mean?
Why'd you do that?

06:38.808 --> 06:45.112
Just 'cause I love her so much,
and I just can't...

06:45.273 --> 06:47.368
just can't stay away.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.611
Mason, you didn't really.

06:51.392 --> 06:52.665
No.

06:52.838 --> 06:56.274
She asked, and I said no.
'Cause I'm awesome.

06:56.685 --> 06:59.019
Come on, please, please,
I don't want to be late.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.689
- Come on.
- Okay.

07:00.884 --> 07:02.743
Don't let him get too much sun,
okay?

07:02.806 --> 07:04.579
- It's all right.
- You have sunscreen, yes?

07:04.615 --> 07:07.654
- No, we don't.
- Oh, come on. Seatbelts.

07:08.864 --> 07:10.966
- Bye, Lane.
- Say "bye."

07:11.060 --> 07:12.412
- Say "bye."
- Bye-bye.

07:12.448 --> 07:14.716
- Say "bye," say "bye."
- Stop it.

07:16.872 --> 07:20.684
- Bye!
- No time, Mom.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.723
Hey, Cora, over here.

07:27.779 --> 07:28.779
Hey.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.651
- You're... you're already here.
- Yeah.

07:31.687 --> 07:34.253
- Hey, Mason.
- Heather. How are you?

07:35.612 --> 07:37.495
Do you guys want to join us?
We have room.

07:37.531 --> 07:39.221
No, no, we're gonna go
sit up on the beach.

07:39.257 --> 07:40.498
- We'll come back and visit.
- Okay.

07:40.616 --> 07:41.616
Okay.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.065
I need some more water.

07:48.170 --> 07:50.170
Okay, I have some right here, actually.

07:50.221 --> 07:51.637
Got some right here.

07:51.673 --> 07:52.854
- There you go.
- Got some.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.405
You got some.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.776
I got some.

07:57.278 --> 07:59.284
Can I do it right here?

08:00.148 --> 08:02.073
Right here?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.590
That one's Grandma.

08:16.598 --> 08:21.331
Then there's Mommy, my Dad...
my Daddy.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
Hey.

08:24.248 --> 08:28.011
Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim.
Can you watch him?

08:28.046 --> 08:29.652
Hm Mm.

08:37.144 --> 08:39.519
Oh! Avalanche!

10:27.695 --> 10:31.664
- What's going on?
- Oh... important business.

10:33.952 --> 10:35.468
Where's Cora?

10:35.952 --> 10:38.673
I don't know...
said she went for a swim.

10:39.274 --> 10:42.196
- Okay.
- I don't see her, though.

10:42.677 --> 10:45.743
Well, when you find her,
why don't you guys come on over?

10:46.235 --> 10:47.614
Yeah, all right, we'll do that.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.376
Okay.

10:54.222 --> 10:55.829
Let's go look for Mama.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.236
- Bring your shovel.
- Mommy!

10:59.481 --> 11:01.384
Well, we're looking for her.

11:01.673 --> 11:04.962
- Mommy!
- Cora!

11:11.706 --> 11:12.861
Cora!

11:18.780 --> 11:20.546
Cora!

11:23.592 --> 11:25.600
Mommy!

11:26.422 --> 11:28.303
Hey, what... what's going on?

11:29.223 --> 11:30.733
What?

11:31.008 --> 11:33.642
- Are you okay?
- Mommy!

11:33.929 --> 11:36.211
What's the matter, baby?
What's the matter?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.626
You okay? You hungry?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.922
- Mommy.
- Yeah.

11:41.415 --> 11:42.844
What were you doing out that far?

11:42.922 --> 11:44.305
We couldn't see you.

11:44.479 --> 11:47.836
I just kept swimming.
I wanted some quiet.

11:48.039 --> 11:49.571
What?

11:49.891 --> 11:51.544
He's fine at his swimming lessons.

11:51.579 --> 11:52.946
The teacher brings him
right out into the water.

11:53.032 --> 11:54.782
He doesn't cry at all.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.461
- He's too attached.
- Here, honey.

11:57.573 --> 12:00.241
He's got to toughen up.
Right, buddy?

12:03.095 --> 12:04.394
Good?

12:10.360 --> 12:11.701
Careful...

12:16.743 --> 12:20.628
Oh, I almost forgot. I have
a surprise for you guys.

12:20.705 --> 12:23.049
Are you gonna finally put your
tongue back in your mouth?

12:25.261 --> 12:27.246
No, it's...
a band I heard about.

12:27.282 --> 12:29.849
They're,
like, amazing. I'm serious.

12:29.884 --> 12:31.464
Okay.

12:35.023 --> 12:36.990
Wait, where did you find this?

12:37.206 --> 12:39.409
- I have my ways.
- Come on, no.

12:39.479 --> 12:41.792
- Babe, just turn it off, please.
- This is Frankie's band

12:41.831 --> 12:44.430
when he was in med school.
That is Frankie on the drums.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.730
- Really?
- This is the biggest hook...

12:46.776 --> 12:49.134
- come on, turn it off.
- No, no, it's so good!

12:49.181 --> 12:50.923
Come on. No.

12:53.095 --> 12:56.442
Want some lotion?
Oil you up?

13:00.415 --> 13:02.215
They're just having fun.

13:03.651 --> 13:05.551
Wait, okay, okay, okay.
Honey... oh, wait.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.586
Let me play this one last
song, and then I'll stop.

13:07.622 --> 13:10.423
I promise.
This one's my favorite.

13:11.692 --> 13:13.439
Guys, this one's my favorite.

13:13.631 --> 13:16.533
You're torturing me.
You know that, right?

13:16.764 --> 13:18.345

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Hey.

Hey, hey.

- Press, press!

14:30.338 --> 14:31.740
Hold it. Hold his shoulder here.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.912
Press here.

14:33.022 --> 14:35.374
Press here. Do not let go.

14:35.410 --> 14:37.943
No, get the... get away! Get away!

14:37.979 --> 14:39.512
- Hey.

14:39.547 --> 14:40.722
- Listen to me.
- Oh, my God.

14:40.758 --> 14:42.325
Hold his shoulder.
Call an ambulance.

14:42.617 --> 14:43.729
I need an ambulance. There's been...

14:43.765 --> 14:46.097
- Someone's been...
- Oh, my God.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.097
Mommy!

14:50.658 --> 14:53.493
Mommy!

15:23.024 --> 15:24.957
- Where's my husband?
- I don't know.

15:24.993 --> 15:27.479
- Let's take you to the station.
- I need to speak to him.

15:27.515 --> 15:29.390
You can call him
when you get to the station.

15:29.497 --> 15:32.431
My son needs to eat.
His rhythm gets thrown off.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.609
He won't sleep.
My husband forgets.

15:34.815 --> 15:37.792
Ma'am, you can make a phone call
the minute we get to the station.

15:37.880 --> 15:41.440
- Just please get in the car.
- Mason! Mason!

15:41.476 --> 15:43.042
Mason!

15:45.756 --> 15:47.646
Mason!

15:51.279 --> 15:54.720
Mason, please! Mason!

16:51.059 --> 16:53.481
So how's it going?

16:53.712 --> 16:56.910
- It's going.
- Where's the suspect?

16:56.973 --> 16:58.359
We're moving her to the station.

16:58.402 --> 17:00.012
She already confessed.

17:01.363 --> 17:02.614
Post Miranda?

17:02.821 --> 17:05.208
Yeah, got all that.

17:05.911 --> 17:09.093
Yeah, it's crazy, man. She
just seems so normal.

17:09.308 --> 17:11.635
- Just a mom with her kid.
- Yeah.

17:13.675 --> 17:15.465
Where were you?

17:18.153 --> 17:20.895
I just had to pick up
a couple things at the house.

17:21.296 --> 17:22.872
- Right.
- Yeah.

17:23.606 --> 17:26.247
Name's Frankie Belmont, 29.

17:26.714 --> 17:28.681
Doctor at Cornell in the city.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.528
Detective Ambrose?
Nathan Belewski.

17:34.098 --> 17:36.356
Nice to meet you.

17:37.528 --> 17:39.190
You haven't been out here in a while.
Huh!

17:39.364 --> 17:41.567
I can't remember the last time
you guys even had a homicide.

17:41.786 --> 17:44.661
It's two years, yeah.

17:44.863 --> 17:48.176
Guy in Gardner killed his wife.

17:50.136 --> 17:53.481
Well, I got to say, this one...

17:54.301 --> 17:56.825
never seen anything quite like this.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.667
Pinus strobus.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.934
See those white pine across there?

18:05.575 --> 18:07.801
They got a blight.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.325
An ecosystem out of balance.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.100
Other side.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.639
Okay, please face forward again.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.473
I need to see your hands.
Put them out there.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.817
Can you please lift your head?

18:42.176 --> 18:44.794
Let me see the neck.

18:51.437 --> 18:54.097
Take off your shirt and
hand it to the officer.

19:08.047 --> 19:11.348
And blessed is the fruit
of your womb, Jesus.

19:11.483 --> 19:15.702
Holy Mary, mother of
God, pray for us sinners

19:15.788 --> 19:18.656
now and at the hour of our death.

19:18.796 --> 19:20.015
God bless Mama.

19:20.124 --> 19:21.655
Amen.

19:22.303 --> 19:23.689
And your little sister?

19:23.796 --> 19:26.897
Oh, yes,
and God bless Phoebe. Amen.

19:27.015 --> 19:29.647
She's gonna be back home
before you know it.

19:30.475 --> 19:33.694
I don't want Mama to come back.

19:35.311 --> 19:38.116
Oh, you don't mean that.
You do too.

19:38.759 --> 19:40.577
You do too.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.947
Good night, Cora.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.585
Mrs. Tannetti?

19:52.958 --> 19:54.825
Mrs. Tannetti?

20:15.530 --> 20:17.304
I should go to the station.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.077
You need to eat something.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.421
Hey, this is Mason.
Leave a message.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.624
Hi, Mrs. Tannetti.
I'm Detective Dan Leroy.

21:08.741 --> 21:10.934
This is Lieutenant
Detective Harry Ambrose.

21:11.038 --> 21:12.515
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.037
Thank you.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.013
You are a resident of Dorchester.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.710
Is that right?

21:25.444 --> 21:27.812
And how long have
you been married?

21:28.043 --> 21:30.249
Three years.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.819
Any other family in the area?
Parents?

21:33.221 --> 21:35.054
No, they're both dead.

21:37.983 --> 21:40.468
Can you please tell me
what's gonna happen to me?

21:41.451 --> 21:44.093
Well, when we're done
here, we'll be moving you

21:44.155 --> 21:46.312
to county jail in Kingston
for booking.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.499
You'll be held there
until your arraignment,

21:48.639 --> 21:51.070
which is when you and your lawyer will
be able to make your plea to the judge.

21:51.124 --> 21:52.788
I don't want a lawyer.

21:53.147 --> 21:56.058
The... the state will provide a
public defender, free of charge.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.437
I know.

21:57.770 --> 22:00.738
A lawyer could reduce
your sentence

22:00.774 --> 22:02.447
even if you decide to plea guilty...

22:02.483 --> 22:04.187
I don't want a lawyer.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.091
I'm sorry.

22:11.196 --> 22:13.630
I already confessed. I...

22:17.710 --> 22:19.569
Just go ahead.

22:20.067 --> 22:21.434
Well, Mrs. Tannetti, we have

22:21.508 --> 22:23.041
a pretty clear-cut situation here.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.275
I mean,
we have signed statements

22:25.310 --> 22:27.866
from multiple eyewitnesses
at the crime scene.

22:28.820 --> 22:31.272
Can you confirm that you
stabbed Frankie Belmont

22:31.312 --> 22:33.429
today at Mottowa State Park?

22:35.954 --> 22:37.905
Can you say yes or no for the record?

22:40.420 --> 22:42.326
Yes.

22:43.356 --> 22:45.255
Can you describe
how you killed him?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.041
I don't understand why we
have to keep going over this.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.486
I told somebody at the beach,

22:51.522 --> 22:53.476
and I just told a woman here before you.

22:53.515 --> 22:54.638
I realize that.

22:54.673 --> 22:57.340
We just need to confirm the details.

23:02.014 --> 23:06.202
I stabbed him with the knife
I was using to peel fruit for my son.

23:07.265 --> 23:09.632
Where did you stab him?

23:16.328 --> 23:18.687
Mrs. Tannetti?

23:20.373 --> 23:22.605
I'm sorry...

23:25.270 --> 23:26.603
I sta...

23:26.749 --> 23:28.397
in his neck...

23:29.575 --> 23:31.187
and in his throat.

23:32.015 --> 23:34.905
And maybe his face.

23:36.335 --> 23:38.788
What's your relationship
with Frankie Belmont?

23:39.351 --> 23:40.882
I don't know him.

23:41.491 --> 23:43.905
You had no interaction
with him before today.

23:44.224 --> 23:47.655
No,
I've never met him before in my life.

23:47.796 --> 23:50.038
Did you expect to see
him there at the beach?

23:51.757 --> 23:54.731
No, I don't know him.

23:54.968 --> 23:57.701
I'm telling you, I've
never met him before.

24:00.245 --> 24:02.613
Then why kill him?

24:07.746 --> 24:09.446
'Cause they were playing that music,

24:09.482 --> 24:11.982
and they kept turning it up.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.607
Mrs. Tannetti,

24:18.160 --> 24:21.054
I realize it isn't easy being here.

24:21.757 --> 24:25.741
It's normal in this
circumstance to be scared.

24:26.537 --> 24:28.966
I'm guessing that this isn't
where you thought you'd be

24:29.020 --> 24:31.637
when you woke up this morning,
is it?

24:34.640 --> 24:38.716
Think you would agree that
people don't usually stab

24:38.778 --> 24:41.364
other people because they're
playing their music too loud?

24:43.692 --> 24:45.591
I realize that.

24:46.005 --> 24:48.640
And you can tell us anything.

24:49.993 --> 24:51.859
Whatever you can.

25:00.415 --> 25:02.482
I don't know.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.833
I just...

25:08.106 --> 25:11.333
I just did it.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.745
And I don't know why.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.713
You want to know what's crazy?

25:24.760 --> 25:26.255
I just got a call from my daughter.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.247
She knows Cora Tannetti.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.027
Says she doesn't seem like the type...

25:30.062 --> 25:33.152
a friendly mom, volunteers at the Y.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.331
So what the hell we got going here?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.027
She off her meds? What?

25:37.190 --> 25:38.855
No history of mental illness.

25:38.963 --> 25:41.035
She takes sleeping pills
sometimes, but that's it.

25:41.089 --> 25:42.527
Drug test is clear.

25:42.675 --> 25:47.222
So... we got everything except for why.

25:47.404 --> 25:49.204
Do we need it?
I mean, we have a confession

25:49.247 --> 25:50.681
and, like, 20 eyewitnesses.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.003
Oh, Dan, come on.

25:52.039 --> 25:54.050
I'm telling you, you
know, when women kill,

25:54.086 --> 25:56.402
- it's people that they're...
- Intimately involved with.

25:56.441 --> 25:57.597
I know, I get it.
That's the profile,

25:57.660 --> 26:01.792
but look at her.
She's not the profile.

26:01.972 --> 26:04.061
So you think she's lying?
You think she knows the guy?

26:04.097 --> 26:05.195
That's not what I'm saying.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.398
I'm saying the whole thing, right?

26:10.135 --> 26:12.871
She attacks him in public,

26:13.418 --> 26:16.808
and there are knife wounds
all over the place.

26:17.088 --> 26:19.777
That's an impulse killing.

26:20.377 --> 26:21.722
It's emotional.

26:21.902 --> 26:24.175
That's why this doesn't make any sense.

26:24.449 --> 26:26.249
Well, maybe she just lost it.

26:26.496 --> 26:28.184
I mean, people keep things bottled up,

26:28.220 --> 26:30.058
and then something sets them
off, and some poor shit

26:30.094 --> 26:31.488
takes the brunt of it.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.356
Look, Harry, I get what you're saying.

26:33.441 --> 26:34.589
I do.

26:34.642 --> 26:37.230
But how does this play out any other way?

26:39.505 --> 26:41.872
Well,
the DA's got more than they need.

26:42.086 --> 26:44.000
I mean, you know?
And I'm already getting

26:44.094 --> 26:46.844
too many calls on this,
so you call them.

26:46.985 --> 26:48.321
Get it filed.

26:48.434 --> 26:50.000
All right.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.024
What about my husband?

27:44.181 --> 27:46.582
I've been here for hours, and
no one has told me anything.

27:46.627 --> 27:48.126
I'm sorry, it's too late.

27:48.226 --> 27:50.344
We have to take you
to county now.

27:50.941 --> 27:52.641
No, what do you mean?

27:52.704 --> 27:54.274
You said that
you'd tell me when he came.

27:54.310 --> 27:55.360
You promised.

27:55.396 --> 27:58.931
He never did. He didn't call.

27:59.376 --> 28:01.008
Sorry.

29:27.305 --> 29:30.939
♪ Giving me love, all of you killers ♪

29:30.974 --> 29:34.541
♪♪

29:34.577 --> 29:36.652
♪♪

29:36.814 --> 29:38.247
Yeah?

29:38.282 --> 29:40.112
Please, help me. I can't sleep,

29:40.197 --> 29:41.950
and I don't have my pills.

29:41.985 --> 29:43.319
I need something.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.994
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

29:45.223 --> 29:47.815
You don't understand. I need it.

29:48.588 --> 29:50.197
Please!

29:50.587 --> 29:52.627
I won't tell anyone.

29:56.643 --> 29:58.268
Hello?

30:00.838 --> 30:02.776
Hello?!

30:18.854 --> 30:19.988
Are you coming?

30:20.023 --> 30:21.322
Stop it!

30:22.916 --> 30:25.015
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

30:25.053 --> 30:26.936
Blessed art thou amongst women...

30:26.972 --> 30:29.882
Pray for us sinners now and
at the hour of our death.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.163
Amen.

30:58.624 --> 31:04.483
Well, if it isn't Dorchester's finest
sneaking around the back door.

31:06.069 --> 31:07.874
I couldn't sleep.

31:09.060 --> 31:10.960
How long's it been? A month?

31:13.015 --> 31:14.702
So did it work?

31:15.133 --> 31:17.140
Did your wife take you back?

31:22.290 --> 31:24.038
How about you let me in?

31:25.124 --> 31:26.569
You're lucky I don't have company,

31:26.608 --> 31:28.390
showing up here like this.

31:35.945 --> 31:37.646
Thank you.

31:40.910 --> 31:42.609
Did you miss me?

31:50.715 --> 31:53.600
So you've been having
some company, huh?

31:54.518 --> 31:56.163
Maybe.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.765
I got this new guy.

32:00.141 --> 32:02.007
He likes to bring his buddy.

32:04.709 --> 32:06.861
Two of 'em, huh? How does that work?

32:06.897 --> 32:08.538
At the same time?

32:09.374 --> 32:12.534
My tips don't exactly
buy me new brake pads.

32:14.438 --> 32:16.438
Don't tell me you're jealous.

32:19.947 --> 32:22.148
Mary...

32:31.886 --> 32:33.686
Get down.

32:42.725 --> 32:44.577
Hands.

33:01.061 --> 33:03.296
I keep thinking about you.

33:03.529 --> 33:05.724
I'm sorry, I...

33:05.862 --> 33:07.762
I cannot...

34:02.746 --> 34:06.198
- Detective!
- Detective!

34:06.555 --> 34:08.025
Did she know the man?

34:08.132 --> 34:10.831
Did she know him?
Did she know the victim?

34:11.097 --> 34:12.995
- Detective!
- Detective, wait!

34:35.746 --> 34:38.745
Well, everything's
kept in good order.

34:38.967 --> 34:40.368
Yeah.

34:40.638 --> 34:42.471
That's the way Cora likes it, so...

34:49.147 --> 34:51.025
You haven't gone to see her yet.

34:51.235 --> 34:54.708
I... I mean, I'm going... I was going.

34:54.745 --> 34:57.940
I am. I will.

34:58.311 --> 35:00.244
Have you two been having trouble?

35:01.991 --> 35:03.256
Nope.

35:05.713 --> 35:07.925
Something's keeping you.

35:08.650 --> 35:12.146
I mean, I don't really know
what to say to her,

35:12.300 --> 35:13.715
to be honest.

35:16.698 --> 35:19.089
The look on her face,
and the... the things

35:19.297 --> 35:21.698
that she said, I...

35:22.478 --> 35:24.784
I mean, it was like she was someone else.

35:25.138 --> 35:26.979
What'd she say?
You didn't mention

35:27.042 --> 35:29.089
anything about that in your statement.

35:29.854 --> 35:31.519
No...

35:32.492 --> 35:34.940
'cause it didn't really make any sense.

35:37.474 --> 35:39.808
After she um...

35:40.170 --> 35:43.198
after she attacked the guy ugh...

35:44.194 --> 35:46.448
she started going towards
the girlfriend,

35:46.484 --> 35:48.283
the one that turned on the music.

35:48.418 --> 35:50.940
The girl, Leah, right?

35:51.697 --> 35:52.901
I don't know...

35:53.908 --> 35:59.416
She said something like, "You're
okay" and "You're safe" um...

35:59.534 --> 36:02.214
and "He's gone now."

36:04.301 --> 36:08.237
Like she was saving her.

36:09.116 --> 36:10.839
I mean, yeah.

36:11.335 --> 36:13.335
That's what it looked like.

36:21.761 --> 36:23.291
Here, why don't you let me hold her?

36:23.327 --> 36:24.604
- No, no, I've got it.
- Here, let me just...

36:24.640 --> 36:25.897
I've got it. Just let me do it!

36:25.933 --> 36:28.972
- Let me do it, let me do it.
- William, William, please.

36:31.193 --> 36:34.045
- Cora?
- Cora?

36:34.175 --> 36:35.928
Come see Mommy.

36:43.607 --> 36:45.573
Would you like to meet your sister?

36:47.126 --> 36:48.726
Come here.

36:53.784 --> 36:56.373
When you were a baby inside of me,

36:57.420 --> 36:59.709
you took up all my strength.

37:00.678 --> 37:02.764
Enough for three children.

37:03.654 --> 37:07.373
So... when Phoebe came,

37:07.597 --> 37:09.553
there wasn't any left for her.

37:11.214 --> 37:13.214
That's why she's so sick.

37:15.639 --> 37:17.748
But I prayed.

37:18.341 --> 37:22.107
In that hospital, I prayed
like I've never prayed before.

37:23.287 --> 37:25.732
And it worked.

37:26.917 --> 37:28.817
You see?

37:32.723 --> 37:34.355
He was testing me.

37:34.725 --> 37:36.824
It's all a test.

37:37.502 --> 37:40.170
Every single thing he expects of us...
listen to me.

37:40.230 --> 37:43.715
Every single thing
he expects of us,

37:44.145 --> 37:45.543
we have to do.

37:45.736 --> 37:47.488
Do you understand?

37:48.014 --> 37:50.080
- Do you?
- Yes.

37:52.071 --> 37:54.337
It's the only way she'll live.

38:12.803 --> 38:15.504
You can sit here.
No touching.

38:22.257 --> 38:24.145
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:24.517 --> 38:26.617
How's Lane?
Is he... is he okay?

38:26.817 --> 38:28.285
- Is he...
- Yeah, he's fine.

38:28.321 --> 38:30.136
He's just...

38:30.235 --> 38:32.202
He's confused.

38:42.090 --> 38:45.863
I'm sorry I... I didn't come yesterday.

38:49.871 --> 38:51.663
I mean, I...

38:51.832 --> 38:56.207
I'm going over everything
in my head, and...

38:57.120 --> 38:59.434
it doesn't make any sense.

38:59.918 --> 39:05.277
And I'm just trying
to figure out why, you know?

39:07.813 --> 39:10.277
I think there's something
wrong with me.

39:10.941 --> 39:14.652
No, I just...
maybe it was just, like...

39:14.793 --> 39:16.255
just like a moment,
you know?

39:16.290 --> 39:19.191
Something that happened,
and that's it.

39:20.504 --> 39:21.840
Something.

39:22.037 --> 39:24.246
So what's gonna happen now?

39:26.699 --> 39:29.316
- I give my statement.
- Yeah.

39:29.957 --> 39:33.863
And they're gonna take me to
my hearing in a few hours.

39:34.378 --> 39:37.246
Okay, and then what?

39:41.343 --> 39:44.578
Then I'm gonna plead guilty.

39:46.973 --> 39:48.777
And that's it?

39:49.316 --> 39:50.996
Can't...

39:52.066 --> 39:54.684
Can't you do something?
What about a lawyer?

39:55.463 --> 39:58.230
A lawyer can't do anything.
I did what I did.

40:07.537 --> 40:09.216
Mason...

40:11.879 --> 40:14.615
Whatever you have to do now,

40:15.693 --> 40:17.896
because of what happened,

40:19.253 --> 40:21.669
I won't blame you.

40:22.521 --> 40:25.115
Because you're gonna have to move on.

40:25.593 --> 40:27.162
And this is not your fault.

40:27.198 --> 40:29.431
You were such a
good husband to me.

40:29.763 --> 40:33.180
I never thought that I would
have a normal life, and I did.

40:33.216 --> 40:35.534
- Cora...
- I really did.

40:35.693 --> 40:38.471
And it's because of you.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.380
Mason.

40:44.890 --> 40:47.076
I got to go, okay?

40:58.973 --> 41:01.005
- Yeah?
- Hey, man, where you been?

41:01.195 --> 41:02.794
Did you ever make it home
last night?

41:02.951 --> 41:05.443
I slept in the office. Look,
I've just been talking

41:05.560 --> 41:07.404
to the DA's office about
Cora Tannetti,

41:07.521 --> 41:10.336
and now I'm on my way
to see Leah Belmont.

41:14.044 --> 41:15.337
Harry, what's going on, man?

41:15.373 --> 41:16.883
I thought we were done
with all this.

41:16.919 --> 41:18.962
Look, if I can get Leah
Belmont to confirm

41:18.998 --> 41:21.279
that Cora Tannetti was in some
kind of delusional state,

41:21.318 --> 41:23.591
then I'm gonna bring that
to Judge Baird.

41:23.806 --> 41:25.706
She'll never accept that guilty plea.

41:25.957 --> 41:27.852
You know you only have
two hours, right?

41:28.052 --> 41:29.721
The arraignment's at 4:00.

41:29.888 --> 41:33.459
Yeah. Yeah, no, I know, I know.

41:45.774 --> 41:47.114
Excuse me.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.170
Can I help you?

41:49.211 --> 41:52.992
Yeah, I'm Detective
Lieutenant Harry Ambrose.

41:53.295 --> 41:55.946
- Patrick.
- Right.

41:56.384 --> 41:58.797
So how's she doing?

41:59.196 --> 42:01.594
The nurses said she was too
unstable this morning,

42:01.851 --> 42:03.852
so they put her back on sedation.

42:09.230 --> 42:12.578
I would really prefer
not to do this again.

42:13.172 --> 42:15.539
I already gave my statement.

42:16.425 --> 42:21.328
So...
did you hear her say anything?

42:21.442 --> 42:23.617
Either during or after?

42:25.703 --> 42:27.094
How about with Leah Belmont?

42:27.130 --> 42:29.697
Did Mrs. Tannetti have any
kind of interaction with her?

42:29.883 --> 42:31.863
I told you, I was...
I was sitting on my towel

42:31.899 --> 42:34.653
the whole time, and then
Frankie was bleeding,

42:34.925 --> 42:37.621
and I was trying to
stop it, and that's...

42:38.176 --> 42:39.738
that's all I remember.

42:40.435 --> 42:43.001
And I'm running late, so...

42:47.435 --> 42:51.650
It's a Hevea brasiliensis.

42:52.473 --> 42:54.462
It's a rubber plant.

42:55.462 --> 42:57.962
It needs more light than it's getting.

43:01.522 --> 43:04.728
So... is that it?

43:05.136 --> 43:06.939
Yeah.

43:08.235 --> 43:10.268
Do you work out?

43:10.625 --> 43:11.994
What?

43:12.634 --> 43:14.926
It looks like you're in great shape.

43:15.369 --> 43:19.173
Thanks. Yeah, sometimes.

43:19.439 --> 43:23.634
I'm just saying, you
know, it makes me wonder

43:23.670 --> 43:25.986
why you didn't try to stop her.

43:26.506 --> 43:29.009
Mason Tannetti, he got up
from where he was sitting,

43:29.045 --> 43:31.176
and he ran... 
from my measurement,

43:31.212 --> 43:33.212
it was about 15 feet...
and then he tackled her,

43:33.347 --> 43:36.220
and you were, what, 4 feet away,

43:36.280 --> 43:38.478
and you never got up off your towel.

43:38.653 --> 43:42.783
So what was that?
Just slow reflexes?

43:43.681 --> 43:45.247
I thought he had it under control.

43:45.283 --> 43:49.173
What part of getting stabbed
seven times is under control?

43:53.048 --> 43:54.494
Look...

43:58.714 --> 44:02.355
I don't know if anyone else saw this,

44:03.524 --> 44:08.496
but from where I was sitting,
I saw Frankie grab her.

44:08.933 --> 44:10.504
At what point?

44:11.113 --> 44:14.379
Right after she stabbed
him the first time.

44:14.816 --> 44:16.410
Right in the neck.

44:16.949 --> 44:19.894
Frankie grabbed her arm like that.

44:21.432 --> 44:24.871
And the thing is, Frankie's a strong guy.

44:25.636 --> 44:27.988
He could have forced her off of him.

44:28.902 --> 44:30.703
So why didn't he?

44:39.035 --> 44:40.111
I don't know.

44:40.214 --> 44:41.605
You know...

44:41.849 --> 44:43.464
You know how the mind plays tricks.

44:43.600 --> 44:46.468
You know, you get all of that
adrenaline going, and, you know,

44:46.754 --> 44:48.754
you see things that aren't there.

44:48.918 --> 44:51.097
Go ahead. What are you remembering?

44:51.559 --> 44:53.058
Tell me.

44:56.723 --> 44:59.057
It looked like he recognized her.

45:01.558 --> 45:03.988
When he saw who it was...

45:04.826 --> 45:06.215
he let her go.

45:07.839 --> 45:09.808
You think he knew her?

45:14.816 --> 45:18.016
And then he let her kill him?

45:25.144 --> 45:28.019
Mrs. Tannetti, you're
charged in the complaint

45:28.089 --> 45:31.793
with a felony violation of section 125.27

45:31.832 --> 45:33.688
of the New York State Penal Code,

45:33.879 --> 45:36.568
in which it's alleged that you
committed a second degree murder

45:36.714 --> 45:38.300
in the death of Frankie Belmont.

45:38.572 --> 45:41.607
Having in mind the rights
which were just read to you,

45:41.754 --> 45:44.199
will you be entering a plea?

45:45.152 --> 45:46.449
Yes.

45:46.940 --> 45:48.840
And what is that plea?

45:49.305 --> 45:55.942
