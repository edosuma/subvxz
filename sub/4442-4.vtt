00:13.830 --> 00:15.431
(speaking indistinctly)

00:16.900 --> 00:19.234
It's getting chilly out.

00:19.302 --> 00:20.769
You might want to
think about getting

00:20.837 --> 00:22.404
your special little
boy a sweater, huh?

00:22.472 --> 00:24.640
Or at least some Omega-3
to thicken his coat.

00:24.707 --> 00:26.340
Yeah, I'll... look into that.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.643
Come on, Thomas James.

00:28.711 --> 00:29.699
God!

00:29.819 --> 00:31.980
What is happening to this park?

00:32.046 --> 00:33.481
It's being overrun by...

00:33.549 --> 00:35.217
dog weirdos.
Dog weirdos?

00:35.337 --> 00:37.718
People who treat their dogs
like cute, amusing,

00:37.786 --> 00:39.408
four-legged little children.

00:39.528 --> 00:41.722
We're descendents of the wolf,
for Christ's sake.

00:41.789 --> 00:44.558
Look at this poor bastard.

00:44.626 --> 00:46.760
Bootsies?
Wow.

00:46.828 --> 00:48.829
And check this out.
WOMAN: What have we here?

00:48.896 --> 00:50.563
(baby voice):
"I did a smelly poo poo, Mommy."

00:50.631 --> 00:52.332
You did a smelly
poo poo for me?

00:52.399 --> 00:53.333
"Yes, I did."

00:53.400 --> 00:54.534
He's not saying that.

00:54.602 --> 00:55.801
She's speaking for him.

00:55.908 --> 00:58.042
He didn't do a smelly
poo poo for her.

00:58.110 --> 00:59.877
He did it for his dead brother.

00:59.945 --> 01:01.846
Hi, baby.
Ooh, you're so cute.

01:01.913 --> 01:04.447
And now she's molesting him,
right in front of us.

01:04.516 --> 01:06.784
Yeah, I guess
that's a little weird.

01:06.851 --> 01:08.786
And here's the worst of all.

01:08.853 --> 01:10.787
This guy must have actually
spoken his mind.

01:10.855 --> 01:13.257
Not only do they
emasculate him with a muzzle,

01:13.325 --> 01:15.526
but they mask the
obvious rights violation

01:15.594 --> 01:16.955
by making it a
comical distraction.

01:16.995 --> 01:18.462
A duck bill? Really?

01:18.530 --> 01:21.265
Okay, that's pretty messed up.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.134
See, that's what I
like about you, Ryan.

01:23.202 --> 01:24.735
You treat me like an equal.

01:24.803 --> 01:27.171
You don't dress me up
or censor what I say

01:27.239 --> 01:29.440
or not let me drool on your
clothes every now and again.

01:34.579 --> 01:37.081
Ooh!
Wouldn't mind getting

01:37.148 --> 01:40.017
my bulbus glandis
dick-anchor stuck up in that.

01:40.085 --> 01:43.254
Yeah, like you said, this place
is crawling with... dog weirdos.

01:43.321 --> 01:44.955
Let's get out of here.

01:45.023 --> 01:46.190
Wait-- are you, like, scared
of that bulbus glandis

01:46.258 --> 01:48.125
dick-anchor chick?

01:48.193 --> 01:50.995
Of course not.
Well, then go and introduce yourself.

01:51.062 --> 01:54.198
I already know her, okay?

01:54.265 --> 01:56.901
Her name's Kim. We went to
high school together, and I had

01:56.968 --> 01:59.369
a huge crush on her.
She was super outgoing

01:59.437 --> 02:01.338
and always starting
these new clubs.

02:01.406 --> 02:03.374
I, on the other hand...

02:03.442 --> 02:06.243
Was an antisocial virgin
with drawn-on pubes-- I get it.

02:06.311 --> 02:08.179
I never actually did that;
it was just a rumor.

02:08.247 --> 02:09.580
Ryan?

02:09.648 --> 02:11.149
Ryan Newman?

02:11.217 --> 02:13.485
Oh... my God.

02:13.552 --> 02:14.452
Kim?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.587
You look great.

02:16.655 --> 02:18.189
What have you been up
to since...

02:18.257 --> 02:21.192
God, graduation, I think?
Well, I...

02:21.259 --> 02:23.126
I worked as a lawyer
for a while and, um...

02:23.194 --> 02:24.561
Tell her about the time

02:24.629 --> 02:26.296
we microwaved
our toenail clippings.

02:26.364 --> 02:28.165
Uh, but what have you
been up to?

02:28.232 --> 02:30.066
Well, I recently started
my own business--

02:30.134 --> 02:31.902
a dog training facility
in Venice.

02:31.969 --> 02:33.036
That's actually
why I'm here today.

02:33.104 --> 02:34.770
I'm passing out flyers.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.518
I love working with dogs;
They're just such

02:36.573 --> 02:38.107
incredible animals.

02:38.175 --> 02:40.777
Speaking of which,

02:40.844 --> 02:42.311
is this your handsome boy?

02:42.379 --> 02:43.513
Uh, no, no, no.
I actually belong

02:43.580 --> 02:44.614
to a gorgeous blonde.

02:44.681 --> 02:46.148
Yeah.
What?

02:46.216 --> 02:48.150
I never took you for a dog guy.

02:48.218 --> 02:51.687
Well, just like you,
I-I love working with dogs.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.822
Uh, I don't mean "working."

02:53.890 --> 02:55.290
I'm just...

02:55.358 --> 02:57.660
super, super into dogs.
Ryan,

02:57.727 --> 03:00.797
you know I don't like feeling
powerless over my own leg.

03:00.864 --> 03:03.233
Oh, shit.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.201
It's happening!

03:05.269 --> 03:07.103
You guys are really cute.
(chuckles)

03:07.171 --> 03:08.672
You know, if your dog
ever needs

03:08.740 --> 03:09.773
any training,
you should totally

03:09.841 --> 03:11.542
bring him to Happy Paws.

03:11.610 --> 03:14.144
Or if you, you know, have
any dog-related questions,

03:14.212 --> 03:16.547
you could just...
call me on my cell.

03:16.615 --> 03:18.649
Um... yeah.

03:18.717 --> 03:20.250
Let me get your number.
Yeah.

03:20.318 --> 03:23.687
I'll never understand
why that happens.

03:23.755 --> 03:26.190
So, you're, like,
"super, super into dogs" now,

03:26.258 --> 03:28.927
is that right?
What? I've always liked dogs.

03:28.994 --> 03:30.762
Then why don't
you have your own dog?

03:30.830 --> 03:33.098
Oh, wait, you do.

03:33.165 --> 03:34.766
Come on, I watch you every day.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.434
It's almost like I'm...
Bullshit.

03:36.502 --> 03:38.403
You just got intimidated
by your old crush.

03:38.471 --> 03:39.437
And since
you couldn't find a pen

03:39.505 --> 03:41.172
to draw on pubes quick enough,

03:41.240 --> 03:42.908
you found some other way
to make yourself look good.

03:42.975 --> 03:44.909
There's nothing wrong with
embellishing a little

03:44.977 --> 03:46.611
when you're talking
to a pretty girl.

03:46.679 --> 03:48.380
Yeah, I used
to play it like that.

03:48.447 --> 03:51.683
I used to tell chicks lies
about myself just to get laid.

03:51.751 --> 03:54.652
One night, I'd be a pilot;
the next, a doctor.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.288
But these women weren't having
sex with a pilot or a doctor.

03:57.356 --> 03:59.090
They were having sex with a lie.

03:59.157 --> 04:00.791
And more sick and depraved
than that?

04:00.859 --> 04:02.560
They were having sex with a dog.

04:02.628 --> 04:04.362
But I learnt my lesson.

04:04.430 --> 04:06.531
And if Kim isn't gonna be
into the real Ryan,

04:06.599 --> 04:08.633
then why do you want
to be with her?

04:08.701 --> 04:09.834
I mean,
for all of Amanda's craziness,

04:09.902 --> 04:11.970
at least she liked you for you.

04:12.038 --> 04:14.239
At least she...
I'm not looking for another Amanda.

04:14.307 --> 04:17.676
At the very least, it'd be fun
to go back to school.

04:17.744 --> 04:20.178
Unlike you, I was one of the
cool kids, back in the day.

04:20.245 --> 04:21.413
(chuckles)

04:21.481 --> 04:23.348
All the chicks used
to bark at me

04:23.416 --> 04:25.350
and all the guys
used to bark at me,

04:25.418 --> 04:27.752
but, like, in a kind of
admiring way,

04:27.820 --> 04:30.121
not, like, in a sexual way,
like with the chicks.

04:30.189 --> 04:31.823
I already got Kim's number.

04:31.891 --> 04:33.925
Why would I suffer through
a training course with you?

04:33.993 --> 04:36.027
Mmm. Because maybe training
would be good for me.

04:36.095 --> 04:38.096
Who knows? Maybe
I could even learn

04:38.164 --> 04:40.799
to one day not drool
all over your clothes.

04:41.934 --> 04:43.568
Nice.

04:46.105 --> 04:47.405
(Wilfred whoops)
JENNA: Wilfred, no!

04:47.473 --> 04:49.641
Yeah! Garbage is the shit!
God...

04:49.709 --> 04:51.643
Wilfred, drop it!

04:51.711 --> 04:54.913
God. Wilfred!
Oh, God. Oh...

04:54.981 --> 04:56.682
Hey, Ryan. Sorry.

04:56.749 --> 04:58.283
I'm gonna clean
this up. Just...

04:58.351 --> 05:00.752
Wilfred has been acting crazy
these past few days.

05:00.820 --> 05:03.689
No problem. Hey, I just wanted
to return your book. I loved it.

05:03.756 --> 05:04.923
What was your favorite story?

05:04.991 --> 05:06.825
"Safari." Totally.
"Safari"? Right?

05:06.893 --> 05:08.427
Thanks for recommending it.
Oh, it's one of my favorites.

05:08.494 --> 05:09.995
I knew you'd like it.
Make it rain on 'em...

05:10.062 --> 05:11.029
Make it rain on 'em.

05:11.097 --> 05:13.531
God! Wilfred!

05:13.599 --> 05:15.967
I don't know what has
gotten into him. He's been

05:16.035 --> 05:17.636
tearing up the furniture,
peeing in the house--

05:17.704 --> 05:19.171
he hasn't acted like this
since we first got him.

05:19.239 --> 05:21.140
God... (groans)

05:21.207 --> 05:23.776
All I can think to do is take
him back to obedience school.

05:23.844 --> 05:26.279
I found this, uh,
flyer in my mailbox.

05:26.346 --> 05:28.782
It's for this new place
called Happy Paws.

05:28.849 --> 05:31.118
I checked it out on Yelp,
and it's got some good reviews.

05:31.185 --> 05:32.705
I'm gonna take him
down there tomorrow.

05:32.754 --> 05:33.887
Hey, why don't...
why don't I take him?

05:33.955 --> 05:35.221
Oh, no, no, no.
I couldn't.

05:35.289 --> 05:36.923
You're way busier than me.

05:36.991 --> 05:38.958
Besides, it'll be fun.
What's the matter, Ryan?

05:39.026 --> 05:41.187
Afraid what your old crush
would think if she found out

05:41.195 --> 05:42.995
I didn't belong to you?
Are you sure?

05:43.063 --> 05:44.230
Yeah.

05:44.297 --> 05:45.231

Embarrass you?! Relax.

in the day, remember?

(dogs barking in distance)

Ryan!

06:26.340 --> 06:29.108
Don't be no fool,
just play it cool,

06:29.176 --> 06:31.611
break all the rules
and be yourself.

06:31.678 --> 06:32.845
I'm so glad

06:32.913 --> 06:34.414
you made it.
Yeah, well,

06:34.482 --> 06:35.615
Wilfred's got
a few behavioral tics

06:35.683 --> 06:37.150
I want to iron out.

06:37.218 --> 06:38.651
Well, you came
to the right place.

06:38.719 --> 06:40.520
This is Champ, by the way.

06:40.588 --> 06:42.522
(baby voice):
"Hello there, Mr. Ryan.

06:42.590 --> 06:45.158
It's so nice to meet you
on this bright and sunny day."

06:45.226 --> 06:48.295
(laughing, kissing)

06:48.363 --> 06:50.664
Holy shit!
She's a dog weirdo!

06:50.732 --> 06:52.866
Little kisses for the mommy.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.569
"Does Wilfred's daddy
get kisses from Wilfred?"

06:55.637 --> 06:57.471
I don't know. Does he?

06:57.539 --> 06:59.439
Come on, give him a kiss.

06:59.507 --> 07:02.209
Ryan. Don't do it.

07:02.277 --> 07:05.746
I'm warning you. Neither
of us is gonna like this.

07:08.016 --> 07:10.483
(Ryan grunting)

07:10.551 --> 07:13.220
(chuckling):
Oh, so cute.

07:13.287 --> 07:16.289
Aw!
(gagging)

07:19.262 --> 07:20.185
Remember...

07:20.305 --> 07:21.985
I can't believe you--
Force-Frenching me

07:22.052 --> 07:23.053
in front of the whole school

07:23.120 --> 07:24.888
just to impress
that dog weirdo?

07:24.956 --> 07:27.091
Just leave me out of it
from now on.

07:27.158 --> 07:29.560
I don't want to look wack
in front of my classmates.

07:29.628 --> 07:32.063
KIM: ...so before we get
started, I just want to lay out

07:32.131 --> 07:34.264
a few ground rules:
First of all,

07:34.384 --> 07:36.719
this gate must remain closed
at all times.

07:36.787 --> 07:38.487
We don't want any
of our little babies

07:38.555 --> 07:39.956
running out into the street.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.159
Blah, blah, blah.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.528
Teachers are so lame,
am I right?

07:44.595 --> 07:46.763
Hey, you guys!

07:46.831 --> 07:48.298
Check out the wiener dog!

07:48.366 --> 07:50.066
It's like,
why aren't you on a bun

07:50.134 --> 07:51.301
with ketchup and mustard?

07:51.369 --> 07:52.402
(laughs)

07:52.470 --> 07:54.070
Oh, shit!

07:54.138 --> 07:55.438
(guffawing)

07:55.506 --> 07:58.474
Oh, hey, what's up, spots?
Nice spots.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.376
It's like,
look at your spots, dude.

08:00.444 --> 08:03.579
I'm totally making fun
of your spots.

08:03.647 --> 08:05.147
Oh, shit!

08:05.215 --> 08:06.482
Okay, who's next? Who's next?

08:09.152 --> 08:10.787
What's up?

08:10.854 --> 08:12.288
(quietly):
Wilfred, pay attention.

08:12.356 --> 08:15.124
Paying attention
is for narcs and dweebazoids.

08:15.192 --> 08:17.127
(chuckles)
Hey, you know what?

08:17.194 --> 08:18.795
You're getting a wedgie,
Poindexter.

08:18.863 --> 08:19.596
(laughing)

08:21.599 --> 08:24.868
...most of our edible products
are organic.

08:24.936 --> 08:27.604
Now, I want to start with
a really basic command,

08:27.672 --> 08:30.007
just to see where we're all at.

08:30.074 --> 08:32.443
Let's try "sit."
Oh, oh. Hey, you guys.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.977
Listen up, listen up.

08:34.044 --> 08:35.813
When Teacher says "sit,"

08:35.880 --> 08:37.014
we all gonna shit.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.049
(laughs)

08:38.116 --> 08:39.918
Ready?

08:39.985 --> 08:43.321
(quietly): Wilfred, don't.
Okay, here we go.

08:43.389 --> 08:44.756
Sit.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.792
(Wilfred grunts, poops)

08:46.859 --> 08:48.894
(giddy laughter)

08:48.962 --> 08:52.765
Hey! What the hell, you guys?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.867
Looks like some of us
have some work to do,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.771
but that's why we're here.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.141
Your boys and girls worked
very hard, so please feel free

09:01.209 --> 09:03.343
to reward them
with a little snacky.

09:03.411 --> 09:06.146
(baby voice): That's not yours.
That's not yours.

09:06.214 --> 09:09.583
All right, so where's
the cool kids' table?

09:09.651 --> 09:12.787
Hey, is that an open seat
over there?

09:12.854 --> 09:14.955
Oh. It's taken?

09:15.023 --> 09:17.525
Hey, what about that seat?
Is that... Oh,

09:17.592 --> 09:18.893
it's taken as well?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.260
It looks like it's...
(barks)

09:20.328 --> 09:23.197
Hey! That wasn't very nice.

09:23.265 --> 09:25.366
(dogs barking)
I was gonna eat that.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.400
What...?

09:27.903 --> 09:29.971
I'm not a loser!

09:30.038 --> 09:32.140
Stop chanting it in unison!

09:34.376 --> 09:35.877
KIM:
So...

09:35.945 --> 09:37.612
did you enjoy class?

09:37.680 --> 09:40.615
Yeah. It was really helpful.

09:40.683 --> 09:42.785
Look, a lot of people
don't understand

09:42.852 --> 09:44.586
how much attention
dogs really need.

09:44.654 --> 09:47.356
I mean, they're like little
four-legged children.

09:47.423 --> 09:49.992
I say exactly the same thing.
Except I say

09:50.060 --> 09:52.794
they're like little people with four legs.
Well, I think

09:52.862 --> 09:54.630
"little children"
is probably more accurate.

09:54.698 --> 09:57.567
"Little people" sort of
implies dwarves or midgets.

09:57.634 --> 09:58.935
Right.

09:59.002 --> 10:00.002
They're not like midgets.

10:00.036 --> 10:03.039
Look, Ryan, I have to say,

10:03.106 --> 10:06.008
I'm sort of worried
you're in danger of becoming

10:06.076 --> 10:08.311
one of those irresponsible
dog owners.

10:08.379 --> 10:10.347
Oh.

10:10.414 --> 10:13.550
W-Well, the reason Wilfred seems
a little out of control is...

10:13.618 --> 10:14.884
He's a rescue?

10:14.952 --> 10:17.954
Yes. Yeah. Exactly.

10:18.022 --> 10:21.058
I-I... I rescued him
off the street

10:21.125 --> 10:22.860
a-about a month ago.

10:22.927 --> 10:26.163
I found him tied
to a... fire escape.

10:26.231 --> 10:28.699
He was starving
and showed signs of abuse.

10:28.767 --> 10:31.369
Oh, God, that is so sad.
I know.

10:31.437 --> 10:34.873
Sometimes I wish I could adopt
every stray in Venice.

10:36.442 --> 10:38.677
I never knew you were like this.

10:38.745 --> 10:41.079
Like, don't take this the
wrong way or anything, but...

10:41.147 --> 10:42.915
in high school, you just...

10:42.982 --> 10:44.950
you always seemed a little...

10:45.018 --> 10:46.585
detached.

10:46.653 --> 10:47.620
Me? Detached?

10:47.688 --> 10:49.088
(chuckles) Really?

10:49.155 --> 10:50.689
It's too bad we didn't hang out

10:50.757 --> 10:53.626
more back then, you know?

10:53.694 --> 10:56.228
Well, we're here now.

10:56.296 --> 10:59.064
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

11:00.667 --> 11:02.234
(baby voice):
A doggy date?

11:02.301 --> 11:05.204
Yeah.

11:05.272 --> 11:07.806
So, school,

11:07.874 --> 11:10.509
that was pretty fun, right?

11:10.577 --> 11:13.846
Hey, listen, Kim and I...
I'm not going back, Ryan.

11:13.914 --> 11:15.548
What? Why?

11:15.615 --> 11:18.384
You were so excited
about going back to school.

11:18.452 --> 11:20.152
It's just...
(sighs)

11:20.220 --> 11:23.322
this new generation,
they're just so much crueler

11:23.389 --> 11:27.092
than they were-- I mean,
we were-- back in the old days.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.261
Some of the kids from class

11:29.328 --> 11:31.763
have been cyber-bullying me
on Facebook.

11:31.831 --> 11:34.766
This guy, he...
barely even knows me.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.368
He called me
"a major dingus."

11:37.436 --> 11:39.437
And-and this other guy,

11:39.505 --> 11:42.440
he said I should
"saw my ears off slowly

11:42.507 --> 11:45.710
"with a dull jigsaw and then
shove my bloody, severed ears

11:45.777 --> 11:48.212
into my own mother's anus."
And that is,

11:48.280 --> 11:50.415
like, really hurtful.

11:50.482 --> 11:52.617
It gets better, Wilfred.

11:52.685 --> 11:54.219
It gets better.

11:54.287 --> 11:56.254
Hey, it's a new school.

11:56.322 --> 11:58.256
You'll fit in eventually.

11:58.324 --> 12:01.426
Besides, if you don't go
back, the bullies win.

12:02.754 --> 12:04.896
You just want me to go back
so you can stick

12:04.964 --> 12:07.232
your non-bulbus-glandis-having,
easily extractable penis

12:07.300 --> 12:08.967
into that dog weirdo.

12:09.034 --> 12:10.168
Hey, you were the one
that convinced Jenna

12:10.236 --> 12:11.703
you needed the training.

12:11.771 --> 12:13.104
Then I'll convince her
I don't need it.

12:13.172 --> 12:14.806
I'll just be
on my best behavior.

12:14.873 --> 12:16.775
And you think Jenna's just
gonna let you out of it?

12:16.842 --> 12:19.010
She prepaid for the
whole course, Wilfred.

12:21.914 --> 12:24.849
Okay, look, I'll lie to Jenna

12:24.917 --> 12:27.519
and tell her that I'm still
taking you to Happy Paws.

12:27.587 --> 12:30.355
But you have to do a
favor for me in return.

12:35.694 --> 12:37.928
(toy squeaks)

12:41.299 --> 12:43.133
(doorbell rings)

12:47.404 --> 12:48.971
Hi.
Hey.

12:49.039 --> 12:50.873
You look great.
Thank you.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.441
That pirate hat is...

12:52.509 --> 12:54.509
The cutest thing ever, right?

12:54.577 --> 12:56.444
(chuckles)
Come in.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.814
Where's Wilfred?
Champy wants to play.

12:59.882 --> 13:02.584
Wilfred!

13:02.651 --> 13:05.220
KIM (chuckling):
Bootsies?

13:05.287 --> 13:07.255
I love it!

13:07.323 --> 13:08.990
I've been meaning
to get Champ a set.

13:09.058 --> 13:10.992
I mean, not only
are they adorbs,

13:11.060 --> 13:13.140
(baby voice): but Champs has
got very sensitive paws.

13:13.196 --> 13:15.564
"Yes, I do, Mommy.

13:15.631 --> 13:17.733
I have sensitive paws."

13:17.800 --> 13:20.369
Aw, so cute.

13:23.973 --> 13:25.941
(chuckles)

13:26.009 --> 13:29.378
Um, the other day, I saw
this great YouTube video

13:29.446 --> 13:32.475
with two dogs, like, holding hands.
Oh, yeah,

13:32.543 --> 13:35.251
I saw that! So sweet.

13:35.319 --> 13:37.854
Yeah.

13:37.921 --> 13:40.923
So, listen...

13:40.991 --> 13:44.360
I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

13:44.428 --> 13:48.864
I heard this rumor back
in high school that you...

13:48.932 --> 13:51.100
Okay, I-I did not use a pen
to draw pubic hair...

13:51.168 --> 13:52.268
...had a crush on me.

13:53.703 --> 13:56.038
O-Oh.

13:56.105 --> 13:57.973
Y-Yeah. Um...

13:58.041 --> 14:01.176
that-that one's true.

14:01.244 --> 14:03.745
'Cause I've had
a really fun night so far.

14:03.813 --> 14:05.246
Really?

14:05.314 --> 14:06.881
Although...

14:06.949 --> 14:08.883
I hope it's not over yet.

14:08.950 --> 14:10.751
Huh, baby?

14:10.819 --> 14:12.453
(baby voice):
"Gee.

14:12.521 --> 14:15.123
"I'm so tired.

14:15.190 --> 14:18.826
"I think I'd like to sleep over
at Wilfred's house tonight.

14:18.894 --> 14:22.858
"Would Wilfred mind
if my mommy and I slept over?

14:23.082 --> 14:24.965
What does Wilfred
think about that?"

14:25.032 --> 14:26.633
No, Ryan.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.168
Don't you do it.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.438
Cutesy voices were never part
of our deal.

14:31.506 --> 14:34.340
(silly Australian accent): "Me and
my mate Ryan would love that."

14:34.408 --> 14:35.508
(laughs)

14:35.576 --> 14:37.811
An Australian accent?

14:37.879 --> 14:39.913
That's hilar.

14:39.981 --> 14:41.649
(forced chuckle)
(laughs) I'll just go

14:41.716 --> 14:42.984
grab my stuff.
Okay.

14:43.051 --> 14:45.953
That is not what I was thinking!

14:46.021 --> 14:47.521
I was thinking how ironic it is

14:47.589 --> 14:49.991
that Abraham Lincoln freed
the slaves, yet he himself

14:50.058 --> 14:52.093
was a slave
to a weird beard style!

14:52.161 --> 14:53.761
You crossed the line!

14:53.829 --> 14:57.031
I agreed to help you, and
you totally sold me out!

14:57.099 --> 14:59.567
Calm down! I just used
a stupid, fake voice.

14:59.634 --> 15:00.935
It doesn't matter.

15:01.003 --> 15:02.770
Doesn't matter?!
(grunts) (shouts)

15:02.837 --> 15:04.971
I want my voice!
Wilfred!

15:05.039 --> 15:08.241
(grunts) I'll bite your face, bitch!
Wilfred, no!

15:08.309 --> 15:09.676
(shouting) Stop it!

15:09.744 --> 15:10.844
Ryan, no!

15:10.912 --> 15:12.479
Ryan, what are you doing?

15:17.893 --> 15:20.828
Kim just took off
after lecturing me for an hour

15:20.896 --> 15:23.431
about the proper way
to discipline your dog.

15:23.499 --> 15:25.633
It obviously
doesn't involve violence.

15:27.269 --> 15:29.704
Look...

15:29.772 --> 15:32.541
I-I shouldn't have done
that cutesy voice for you.

15:32.608 --> 15:35.477
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault, Ryan.

15:35.545 --> 15:38.079
Maybe I'd be better off
with a cutesy voice.

15:38.147 --> 15:40.982
My own voice just gets lost
in all the white noise.

15:41.050 --> 15:42.817
You probably noticed

15:42.885 --> 15:45.687
I took down my Facebook page.
I...

15:45.755 --> 15:47.489
did not notice.
I got tired

15:47.557 --> 15:50.192
of all the hate and vitriol.

15:50.260 --> 15:53.028
Champ tweeted tonight
about how earlier

15:53.096 --> 15:56.866
I "totally spazzed out"
like the spaz that I am.

15:56.934 --> 16:00.135
Now everyone at school is
calling me a mental case,

16:00.203 --> 16:03.138
a freak, an outcast.

16:03.206 --> 16:05.140
And they're right.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.675
Well, like we agreed,

16:06.742 --> 16:08.009
you don't have to worry
about going back there.

16:08.077 --> 16:09.277
No, no. You were right.

16:09.345 --> 16:10.945
I have to go back.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.781
Otherwise, the bullies win.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.183
Wilfred, you really don't have to.
I want to.

16:17.253 --> 16:19.985
(sighs)

16:20.053 --> 16:21.985
What are you working on?

16:22.053 --> 16:24.187
I'm drawing a picture...

16:24.255 --> 16:25.588
of mountaintops,

16:25.656 --> 16:27.524
with me on top.

16:27.591 --> 16:29.525
Lemon yellow sun.

16:29.593 --> 16:31.561
Arms raised in a "V."

16:31.629 --> 16:34.630
And the dead lay in pools
of maroon below.

16:34.698 --> 16:36.098
And then...

16:36.166 --> 16:38.367
then there's Spider-Man there.

16:38.434 --> 16:41.303
I just thought
that would be pretty cool.

16:41.370 --> 16:44.405
(bubbling)

16:44.472 --> 16:46.573
RYAN:
Wilfred, lie down.

16:48.943 --> 16:51.177
Good work, everyone.

16:51.245 --> 16:52.945
I see lots of improvements.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.880
So, I'll see you next week.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.250
Kim, I-I just want
to apologize again

16:58.318 --> 16:59.685
for what happened
the other night.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.354
Oh, you don't need
to keep apologizing, Ryan.

17:02.421 --> 17:04.821
If you're truly sorry,
you'll consider fixing

17:04.890 --> 17:06.390
your relationship with Wilfred.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.258
Totally. You're right.

17:08.326 --> 17:09.727
Would you be open
to using a muzzle?

17:11.896 --> 17:12.796
Uh...

17:13.999 --> 17:15.965
Y-Yeah, I...

17:16.034 --> 17:18.068
Not only is this going
to eliminate the threat

17:18.136 --> 17:19.301
of Wilfred biting,

17:19.369 --> 17:20.703
the one I got you,

17:20.771 --> 17:22.872
it's a total cute-splosion.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.173
(polite chuckle)
(giggles)

17:24.241 --> 17:25.641
Wilfred...!

17:25.709 --> 17:27.476
What are you doing, boy?
Deeper.

17:27.544 --> 17:29.811
More confident.
Remember, you're in control.

17:29.879 --> 17:32.814
Just doing what all freaks do,
at some point:

17:32.881 --> 17:36.917
sewing the seeds
of chaos and anarchy.

17:36.984 --> 17:38.185
(deeper):
Wilfred, stop!

17:38.252 --> 17:40.320
A little firmer.
A little firmer.

17:40.387 --> 17:42.455
You want me to stop?
Fine.

17:42.523 --> 17:44.624
I'll stop. I promise.

17:44.691 --> 17:48.027
In fact...
let's shake on it.

17:49.462 --> 17:50.329
Oh, God.
Everyone,

17:50.397 --> 17:51.930
the gate is open!

17:51.998 --> 17:53.565
There's nothing
standing between you

17:53.633 --> 17:55.167
and the bustling traffic!

17:55.235 --> 17:57.169
You made me the freak!

17:57.237 --> 18:00.873
Now I'll make you the roadkill!

18:00.940 --> 18:02.641
Come on, boys.
Wilfred, no...

18:02.709 --> 18:05.110
Come on, boys!
(dogs barking)

18:05.178 --> 18:06.011
Shit.
Come on, boys!

18:06.079 --> 18:07.446
Come on!

18:07.514 --> 18:07.913
Stay!

18:07.981 --> 18:10.048
(barks)

18:10.116 --> 18:15.888
Noooooo...!

18:15.955 --> 18:18.590
Why can't you just
let the bullying go?

18:18.658 --> 18:20.458
Why do you care so much

18:20.526 --> 18:22.446
about what the other dogs
at school think of you?

18:22.461 --> 18:25.130
(muffled, indistinct talking)

18:25.197 --> 18:26.898
I said, what about you?!

18:26.966 --> 18:29.067
Why do you care so much
what Kim thinks?!

18:29.134 --> 18:31.002
I don't know.
Because I like her!

18:31.070 --> 18:33.305
I just want to have fun!
What's the big deal?!

18:33.372 --> 18:35.307
She has no idea
who you really are!

18:35.374 --> 18:38.277
Why are you so afraid
to show her the real you?!

18:38.345 --> 18:41.013
Because the last time I showed
someone the real me,

18:41.080 --> 18:42.881
she was dragged off
to a mental institution.

18:42.949 --> 18:46.385
Ryan...

18:46.453 --> 18:48.921
what happened with Amanda
wasn't your fault.

18:48.988 --> 18:51.423
Yeah, it didn't work out,

18:51.491 --> 18:53.225
but it proves you're capable

18:53.293 --> 18:55.294
of having a deep, healthy
relationship...

18:55.362 --> 18:56.796
as yourself.

18:56.863 --> 18:58.931
Maybe you won't
find it again today.

18:59.051 --> 19:01.768
Maybe not tomorrow.
But someday.

19:01.835 --> 19:04.337
And it'll be worth the wait.

19:07.621 --> 19:10.189
KIM: Dropping the class
is not a good idea, Ryan.

19:10.257 --> 19:11.691
Wilfred has a long way to go.

19:11.758 --> 19:13.559
I think he'll be okay.

19:13.627 --> 19:16.862
Well... so when will
I see you again?

19:16.930 --> 19:19.865
I'm sure we'll run
into each other.

19:19.932 --> 19:21.166
Take it easy.

19:21.234 --> 19:22.301
WILFRED:
Okay, I'll do it.

19:22.368 --> 19:24.736
(silly voice):
Hi, my name is Ryan.

19:24.804 --> 19:26.939
(laughs)
I'm just chatting

19:27.007 --> 19:28.440
with one of
my homies from class.

19:28.508 --> 19:30.642
(silly voice):
My hobbies include Ping-Pong,

19:30.710 --> 19:32.311
reading and carrying

19:32.379 --> 19:34.413
my friend's turds around
in a plastic bag.

19:34.481 --> 19:36.048
(chuckles)

19:36.116 --> 19:37.683
Oh, you like my Ryan voice?

19:37.751 --> 19:38.884
(laughs)

19:38.952 --> 19:40.853
I know. Nailed it.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.354
Yeah, all right.

19:42.422 --> 19:44.389
Yeah, see you at the party
on the weekend, digger.

19:44.457 --> 19:45.390
I said "digger."

19:45.458 --> 19:47.092
With a "D."

19:47.160 --> 19:50.529
No, no, uh, because you're
a dog and you like to dig.

19:50.596 --> 19:52.597
Digger.

19:52.665 --> 19:54.699
No, I-I d...
I think you missed...

19:54.766 --> 19:56.887
Yep. I'll sh...
I'll shut up.

20:00.763 --> 20:03.965
Huh... I wouldn't have guessed that.
Oh, yes.

20:04.033 --> 20:06.401
The poodle is
a very macho breed.

20:06.468 --> 20:08.603
It takes a tough individual
to pull off that haircut.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.272
If I saw a poodle come at me,
I'd cross the street.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.874
Really?
Oh. Mm-hmm.

20:13.942 --> 20:17.644
I'll tell you what breed
is a little iffy, though.

20:17.712 --> 20:21.014
What?
And this'll surprise you...

20:22.584 --> 20:24.651
...poodles.

20:24.719 --> 20:27.588
But... y-you just
said they were tough.

20:27.655 --> 20:30.357
I bet that's
why you're surprised.

20:33.695 --> 20:36.530
Wait, so... and the ship just
sank to the bottom of the...

20:36.597 --> 20:38.699
deep blue sea?

20:38.766 --> 20:40.901
Yep.
They didn't see the iceberg?

20:40.969 --> 20:42.636
Nope.

20:42.704 --> 20:44.639
And they didn't
smell the iceberg?

20:44.706 --> 20:46.641
Nope.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.476
They didn't hear the iceberg?

20:48.544 --> 20:50.779
Nope.

20:51.981 --> 20:53.729
Idiots.
