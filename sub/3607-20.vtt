00:02.001 --> 00:03.252
Previously on Lost:

00:03.337 --> 00:06.339
How do you open the hatch
that has no handle, no latch?

00:06.423 --> 00:08.591
People are talking
about what we're doing.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.343
- Tell them.
- They're not ready.

00:10.427 --> 00:12.970
- I saw a Beechcraft.
- What is inside of it?

00:13.055 --> 00:15.014
You're gonna have
to climb up there.

00:15.099 --> 00:16.599
Anybody out there?

00:16.684 --> 00:17.892
Mayday!

00:22.439 --> 00:23.606
Help!

00:24.358 --> 00:27.360
- What happened?
- An accident. Boone fell off a cliff.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.237
Tell me exactly what happened.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.989
John? Locke?

00:32.950 --> 00:34.450
Come on, out of the way!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.412
I need room.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.081
- Keep him steady.
- Can you hear me?

00:40.165 --> 00:41.582
What happened?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.501
- He was with Locke.
- Keep him steady.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.545
- He's bleeding.
- I know he's bleeding.

00:45.629 --> 00:48.047
Keep him steady, damn it!
You gotta press harder.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.216
- I'm trying.
- All right. Slow and gentle.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.802
Easy!

00:55.139 --> 00:57.890
Sun, pair of scissors
in the second drawer of the cart.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.268
Second drawer.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.107
There are diapers in the drawer.
Sun's gonna switch with you.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.067
- Sun, I need...
- Yes, I understand.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.027
Grab me that seat
from up there.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.697
I need that mesh.
We need to create some sterile...

01:12.781 --> 01:17.034
- I swear to God, if you faint...
- No. First Class, mesh, I'm cool.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.661
- Lord.
- Get to the beach.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.038
Ransack Sawyer's stuff.
I want his alcohol.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.874
Rubbing, scotch...

01:25.335 --> 01:27.587
What's going on?

01:27.671 --> 01:29.756
His lung just collapsed.

01:31.383 --> 01:53.571
Okay.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.448
Good, Boone.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.659
Good, Boone.
That's good. Good job.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.872
All right. I'm gonna put a tube in that
and you're gonna be just fine.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.083
What are you still doing here?

02:07.002 --> 02:10.713
Alcohol. You want him to live?
Get to the beach! Now!

02:25.187 --> 02:26.979
Damn it.
Just get the clip-on.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.857
You know why they call it a tie?
'Cause you gotta tie it.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.443
Know why they call it a clip-on?
You clip it on.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.156
- You nervous?
- What do I have to be nervous about?

02:37.241 --> 02:40.451
- It's a big responsibility.
- I can handle responsibility.

02:40.536 --> 02:42.703
You don't like to get up
in front of crowds.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.913
I'll be fine.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.708
After eight beers,
I'll be fine.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.086
- She'll bust you, man.
- I'll brush my teeth.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.588
She'll bust you.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.509
You can still back out, Marc.

02:57.928 --> 03:01.889
No, it's just a stupid speech.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.933
I'll make you proud.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.561
Okay, groom's turn.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.023
You can still back out, Jack.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.488
Oh, it hurts.

03:18.907 --> 03:22.285
It's a closed fracture,
but I think I can set it.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.620
- I'm gonna die.
- His chest, the wound...

03:24.705 --> 03:27.498
...can you sew him?

03:27.583 --> 03:31.377
He's lost a lot of blood. I don't know
how far Locke had to carry him.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.088
Listen. Listen!

03:35.090 --> 03:37.300
You are not gonna die.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.968
I'm gonna fix this, okay?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.472
I am going to save you.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.291
You gotta flip them
or they'll burn, Walt.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.127
Hey, mamacita!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.463
Want some fish?

04:16.548 --> 04:19.007
No thanks.
I'm not really hungry.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.347
How long do you think?
'Til it's ready?

04:24.932 --> 04:27.058
Maybe a week. Maybe less.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.646
You okay?

04:31.730 --> 04:34.649
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right, I'll see you guys later.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.402
She likes me.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.989
Hey, Jin!

04:42.074 --> 04:45.618
Want some fish?
Take a break. Eat some fish.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.791
Man's got what I call
an overzealous work ethic.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.293
Try "obsession".

04:54.378 --> 04:58.381
- He wants off this island bad, man.
- Can't say I blame poor Kato.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.550
His lady speaks English all this time
and he didn't have a clue?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.469
Surprised he didn't
swim outta here.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.597
- Hell, I would've.
- Sawyer, I need all your alcohol.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.224
Now!

05:11.478 --> 05:12.979
How'd it happen?

05:13.063 --> 05:16.732
Locke said that he fell off a cliff
while they were out hunting boar.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.693
The boar they never seem to get?

05:20.195 --> 05:23.823
- Is that it?
- Afraid so. You need anything else?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.909
- I can come with you.
- Too many cooks already.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.703
But thanks.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.250
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.020
- He needs blood.
- What?

05:54.104 --> 05:57.106
Blood, a transfusion.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.275
- How will you do...
- I don't know.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.943
We'll figure it out.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.490
After I set the leg.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.705
- Let me.
- No, that's okay.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.290
Let me.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.877
Get some air.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.552
How is he?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.721
- Don't know yet.
- What happened out there?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.723
- Where's Locke?
- I don't know.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.767
- What? He just took off?
- Yeah.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.269
- Charlie, he just took off.
- Where's Shannon?

06:35.353 --> 06:37.146
- I don't know.
- She's his sister.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.689
I don't know where she is!

06:43.320 --> 06:45.321
And here she is,

06:45.405 --> 06:48.240
the future Mrs. Jack Shephard.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.867
Thank you, Marc.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.787
Wow! Can I get
another microphone?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.580
I think this one's been drinking.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.544
A little over two years ago,

07:00.629 --> 07:02.505
I blew a tire out,

07:02.589 --> 07:05.841
flipped over the center divider
into oncoming traffic

07:05.926 --> 07:08.719
and was hit head-on
by an SUV.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.722
My back was broken.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.392
They all said it was irreparable.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.689
And then there was Jack.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.653
And he promised
that he would fix me.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.866
Because that's
the kind of guy he is.

07:33.578 --> 07:37.373
Because you are the most
committed man I have ever known.

07:39.292 --> 07:43.045
Because you fixed me,

07:45.006 --> 07:48.551
I will dance at our wedding.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.056
To Jack.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.186
My hero. Jack.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.451
Give him this for the pain.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.540
I think we're a little beyond
herbal remedies here.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.542
It is not a remedy.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.429
Will you hold his shoulders?

08:46.109 --> 08:47.318
Here we go.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.631
Come on.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.660
Claire?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.536
What're you doing out here?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.331
Nothing.
Just leave me alone, please.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.505
Oh, God.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.800
You're having the baby.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.266
- We need to get you back to camp.
- No.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.769
- I just need to catch my breath.
- It's okay. You're having your baby.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.896
No, I'm not.
It's just gas pains.

10:05.981 --> 10:08.190
- You're having contractions.
- No, I'm not!

10:08.275 --> 10:10.609
- Just leave me alone.
- I gotta get you to Jack.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.362
- Please, try to stand.
- Look, I can't!

10:19.327 --> 10:20.494
Help!

10:22.539 --> 10:25.165
Somebody help!

10:26.251 --> 10:28.377
Help!

11:09.377 --> 11:10.669
Hey, Jin!

11:10.754 --> 11:13.505
I need you to go to the caves
and get Jack. Okay?

11:13.590 --> 11:14.631
Understand?

11:16.051 --> 11:18.635
- We need Jack.
- Jack. Doctor.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.765
- Yes, a doctor. Please come here.
- Oh, this one's big.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.060
- Don't leave me.
- Oh, no, honey, I won't.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.645
I'm not going anywhere, okay?
I promise.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.775
Jack. Hurry.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.028
- Ask him again.
- He's in shock.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.280
That's why you need
to ask him again.

11:41.785 --> 11:44.161
Boone, can you hear me?

11:44.245 --> 11:46.622
What is your blood type?

11:49.334 --> 11:53.504
Boone, please listen.
What is your blood type?

11:53.588 --> 11:54.880
Damn it.

11:54.964 --> 11:59.385
- Maybe a smaller piece.
- Veins are like a wet noodle.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.554
First you have to find one;
then you have to have a hollow needle

12:02.639 --> 12:05.724
sharp enough to actually pierce it.
I've got bamboo.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.314
None of that matters because
I don't know his blood type.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.401
- Not to mention his injuries...
- A-negative.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.532
- Boone, what'd you say?
- Oh, Shannon, the plane.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.617
Did you hear "A-negative?"

12:24.327 --> 12:27.746
Get Charlie. Ask everyone you can find
what their blood type is.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.082
A-negative, okay?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.917
And find his sister.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.293
Find Shannon.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.462
Where are we going?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.634
- This way.
- Oh, okay.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.973
Are you lost?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.517
No. Absolutely not.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.020
Those trees look really familiar.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.566
It's this way, I think.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.819
Did you say "I think"?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.539
Surprise.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.794
Damn it.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.463
I found an "A".

13:18.131 --> 13:20.215
- Positive or negative?
- She doesn't know.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.969
I also found two B-positives
and one A/B-negative.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.971
At least he thinks so.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.141
- Did you find any O-Negatives?
- Sun said A-Negative.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.186
- Where is she?
- We split up. I thought she'd be here.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.647
- And you only asked four people?
- I asked the whole sodding camp.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.817
No one knows their blood type.
I don't know my blood type.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.487
- Did you find Shannon?
- No.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.197
I was getting you this.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.662
A hollow needle.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.749
Sharp enough to pierce a noodle.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.507
It's perfect.

14:01.591 --> 14:05.427
Not to rain on your parade, but I
thought you said we needed A-negative.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.180
- Or O-negative.
- Right. Which no one is.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.682
Someone is.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.186
- You! Why'd you make me...
- O-neg is "universal donor".

14:14.270 --> 14:17.231
It's in the ballpark,
it's not a match.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.108
My blood could put him into
anaphylactic shock.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.486
Stop his heart.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.948
You mean he'll die?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.616
He's not gonna die.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.303
Those girls are checking you out.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.724
You're in your PJ's.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.643
Indeed I am.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.647
- Are they cute?
- Who?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.816
The girls who are checking me out.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.195
One of them's kinda cute.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.697
The other one's just trashy.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.451
- Heart and Soul?
- You got it.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.496
- I'm taking the easy part.
- Of course.

15:22.213 --> 15:25.382
You know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.802
How do you know I haven't?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.888
Because you haven't.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.807
Sorry.

15:35.351 --> 15:38.395
It was a silly idea.
I read too many bridal magazines.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.316
- I think it rotted my brain.
- Sarah, I want to. I'm going to.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.445
I just have to figure out
the right way to say it.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.034
Just vows.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.040
Hey...

16:01.711 --> 16:03.503
- ...he's gonna come.
- Yeah.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.589
I know.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.928
So you stay here
as long as you need to.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.350
Then, when you're ready,
I'll be upstairs.

16:22.357 --> 16:26.610
I cannot wait to marry you,
Jack Shephard.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.248
Jack! Jack!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.919
- Doctor? Jack!
- Jack.

17:06.192 --> 17:09.528
- Claire!
- Claire? What about Claire?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.366
He says Claire's with Kate.
She's in labor.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.367
Claire's having the baby?
Where?

17:20.289 --> 17:22.999
He says he thinks she's okay,
but she's in pain.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.627
Does he know how fast
the contractions are coming?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.590
- Every two minutes.
- Is she nauseous?

17:30.967 --> 17:33.885
Can she stand? Is there any bleeding?
Did her water break?

17:36.139 --> 17:37.806
No, none of that.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.142
- But she can't move.
- We should go.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.145
What do we need?
Towels? Bandages? Hot water?

17:43.229 --> 17:45.522
- How do we take water?
- You'll figure that out.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.858
Tell Jin to take Charlie
and go back to Claire.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.236
I can do that. That dilating thing,
how do you look for that?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.030
Listen to me. Tell Kate...
Charlie, look at me.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.075
Tell Kate to wait
until the contractions

17:57.160 --> 17:58.660
are 60 seconds apart.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.745
You got that?

17:59.829 --> 18:02.164
Now, she's gonna need
to make sure Claire pushes

18:02.248 --> 18:03.749
but not too hard, not too fast,

18:03.833 --> 18:05.709
just until the head is clear,

18:05.793 --> 18:08.086
and then as hard as she can.

18:08.171 --> 18:11.923
When the baby is out, make sure
she clears its nose and its mouth.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.843
- But you'll be there by then, right?
- No, I won't.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.970
I'm not going anywhere.

18:17.889 --> 18:20.098
I need to stay here.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.516
And you tell Kate...

18:22.518 --> 18:25.604
...she's gonna have to
deliver this baby.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.826
They've stopped!

18:41.496 --> 18:44.748
- That happens, I think.
- No. They're not coming anymore.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.793
- I'm fine. I'm okay.
- Claire...

18:47.877 --> 18:51.379
- No. I'm okay. Really.
- I don't think that you should be...

18:52.965 --> 18:55.967
- What is that?
- I think your water just broke.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.471
No, no.
I can't have the baby now.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.641
- Just hold on.
- I can't have the baby now!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.267
Jack's coming.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.395
Claire, he's coming.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.459
I screwed myself up pretty bad, huh?

19:34.715 --> 19:36.842
My leg hurts.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.844
Don't try to move it.

19:38.928 --> 19:42.764
- Can you breathe okay?
- It fell on me.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.184
- What fell?
- A plane. It was a plane.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.939
Locke said you fell from a cliff.

19:51.023 --> 19:54.526
No, it was...

19:54.610 --> 19:57.821
It fell... the plane.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.782
It's because of the hatch.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.243
We found the hatch...

20:03.327 --> 20:05.871
Stay with me, man.
Stay with me.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.088
John said not to tell.

20:16.924 --> 20:21.344
- They built a hatch.
- What'd Locke do? What hatch?

20:21.429 --> 20:23.597
My leg hurts.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.524
Shannon... Shannon.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.916
I need to tell you something.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.918
All right.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.425
My brother, Boone,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.802
he's not really my brother.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.220
He's my step-brother.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.017
Our parents got married
when we were, like, eight and 10.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.397
He's kind of in love with me.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.525
In love with you?

21:20.738 --> 21:23.531
And how do you feel
towards him?

21:23.616 --> 21:26.618
I'll always feel something for him,

21:27.995 --> 21:30.872
but am I in love with him
in that way?

21:30.957 --> 21:34.250
No. Not at all.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.713
We're here for,
God knows how long,

21:38.798 --> 21:40.757
and so is Boone.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.803
Maybe we should go back.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.558
- I don't wanna go back.
- Are you sure?

21:50.643 --> 21:52.352
Yes.

21:55.940 --> 22:00.026
I just need to take it
a little slow.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.239
Are you okay with that?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.199
I had no expectations.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.122
Right.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.834
Hopes.
Not expectations.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.590
Oh God, that hurts.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.677
Hello?

22:25.761 --> 22:28.263
Hey, Kate. Claire?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.723
- Is she okay?
- Where's Jack?

22:29.807 --> 22:31.266
- He couldn't come.
- What?

22:31.350 --> 22:34.853
He's pouring his own blood
into Boone's arm right now.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.857
Okay, we'll just have to pick her up
and bring her to him.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.151
- No, Kate.
- We have to, before it's too late..

22:43.821 --> 22:45.030
Look, here.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.824
Jack said you have
to deliver the baby.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.617
- What?
- He talked me through it.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.786
- It's relatively simple.
- I can't do this.

22:51.871 --> 22:55.540
- Yes, you can. I have water, towels.
- I can't deliver this baby.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.459
Well, somebody bloody has to!

23:06.802 --> 23:09.137
I was out there for over a week,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.431
days I can't remember.

23:11.515 --> 23:15.018
I mean, what if they
did something to the baby?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.939
God, I'm not ready for this.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.150
I'm not...

23:22.234 --> 23:25.028
I'm so scared.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.988
I'm scared.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.494
I'm scared too.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.749
But we're gonna
get through this together.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.586
Okay?

23:51.514 --> 23:53.681
Come on, Boone.

24:04.819 --> 24:05.985
It's not working.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.908
The blood's not the problem,
it's the leg.

24:11.992 --> 24:16.037
All the blood's pooling there,
compartment syndrome.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.582
He didn't get this injury
from a fall.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.626
Something crushed his leg.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.800
- What are you doing?
- You've given him enough.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.321
Whoa. Dude.
You alright, man?

24:50.406 --> 24:53.324
- You're looking kinda goth.
- Look, where's Michael?

24:53.409 --> 24:56.786
- The beach, I think.
- I need you to go get him for me.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.414
- What for?
- Just get him.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.181
Hey, kiddo!

25:20.895 --> 25:23.646
- Hey.
- How's the water?

25:23.731 --> 25:26.983
Oh, it's fantastic.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.531
Screaming kid next to me
in first class.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.283
How does that happen?

25:43.667 --> 25:45.627
What you got there?

25:47.171 --> 25:49.964
Sarah wants us to
write our own vows.

25:55.095 --> 25:59.182
"My heart skips beats
at the sound of your voice,

25:59.266 --> 26:03.478
my skin warms to the touch
of your fingers.

26:03.562 --> 26:07.565
Where you go, I will go..."
Etcetera.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.068
This is very nice.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.738
Those aren't my vows.
Those are hers.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.990
I stole them out of the room.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.162
- I can't write mine.
- You're a doctor.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.040
- You're not a writer.
- Right.

26:31.006 --> 26:35.385
- Sarah is a beautiful girl.
- Hell yeah, she is.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.846
You love her?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.350
Absolutely.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.937
Then why are you
sitting out here?

26:54.905 --> 26:58.157
What if I can't be the husband

26:58.242 --> 27:00.618
or the father that I wanna be?

27:03.747 --> 27:05.957
What if I asked her because...

27:09.044 --> 27:11.254
...I saved her life?

27:21.265 --> 27:23.641
Should I marry her, Dad?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.316
Commitment.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.152
It's what makes you tick, Jack.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.448
The problem is,

27:38.532 --> 27:40.950
you're just not good
at letting go.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.834
- You're saying Locke lied?
- He didn't fall.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.086
His leg was pinned
under something heavy.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.006
Okay, Jack, wait.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.384
The cargo container?
We gotta do this?

27:58.469 --> 28:00.928
- What about the axe?
- I can't use the axe.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.765
What are you doing?

28:07.019 --> 28:09.729
His right leg
is filling with blood.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.023
If I don't stop it,
I won't be able to save him.

28:12.775 --> 28:15.193
- You don't mean the...
- The leg is dead.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.167
There's no other choice.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.926
I think this is the time
you're supposed to push.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.804
So... push.

28:45.808 --> 28:48.810
Don't hold your breath.
You're not going to be able to push...

28:49.937 --> 28:51.145
Claire?

28:51.814 --> 28:53.064
What are you doing?

28:55.984 --> 28:58.861
Oh, no.
You need to push right now.

28:58.946 --> 29:02.198
Don't do this, okay?
You can't stop this. This is happening.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.367
Your baby is coming
and I need your help.

29:07.955 --> 29:11.541
- It's not gonna want me.
- What?

29:11.625 --> 29:14.085
It knows I don't want it
and I was gonna give it away.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.504
Babies know that stuff.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.174
Do you want this baby now?

29:24.138 --> 29:27.515
Do you want it
to be healthy and safe?

29:28.809 --> 29:31.602
Okay. Then the baby
knows that too.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.814
You're not alone in this.
We are all here for you.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.735
This baby is all of ours.

29:41.363 --> 29:45.950
But I need you to push.
Okay?

29:47.744 --> 29:48.911
Okay.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.372
On the count of three.
Ready?

29:51.832 --> 29:55.710
One... two... three.
Push.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.171
Go ahead.
That's good. Push.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.966
Good.

30:04.011 --> 30:07.472
- Yeah, that's good. Push!
- Yeah. Right. Okay.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.403
Jack.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.709
Let's go.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.921
On three. One.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.424
- Two. Three.
- Why are you doing this?

30:44.551 --> 30:47.929
He's bleeding inside.
You're not helping him.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.723
You can't save him.
You just can't.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.350
Don't tell me what I can't do!

30:54.102 --> 30:55.394
One, two, three, go.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.965
You don't need to see this.

31:27.469 --> 31:31.138
You need me, just shout.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.356
...In sickness, in health.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.484
In good times and bad.

32:27.529 --> 32:31.282
I risk it all,
because I love you.

32:31.825 --> 32:36.245
Thank you, Sarah.
Jack has also prepared his vows.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.206
Jack, if you would, please.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.553
Jack?

32:56.892 --> 32:59.810
I didn't write any vows.

33:01.813 --> 33:06.067
I've been trying to for a month
but, I couldn't.

33:08.612 --> 33:11.947
So I started to wonder
why that was.

33:12.032 --> 33:15.785
And as time went on,
it only got worse.

33:17.204 --> 33:22.124
Because I'm not good
at letting go.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.757
Or maybe I'm afraid
of what will happen if I fail.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.930
But I know one thing.

33:36.431 --> 33:41.227
I would have never been able to write
anything as beautiful as what you said.

33:42.729 --> 33:47.316
And last night, when you were
talking about the accident,

33:47.401 --> 33:49.944
you got it all wrong.

33:51.655 --> 33:53.614
I didn't fix you.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.454
You fixed me.

34:03.250 --> 34:08.170
I love you, Sarah,
and I always will.

34:33.905 --> 34:41.245
Wait.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.831
I have to.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.085
- If I don't...
- I'm all mashed up inside.

34:49.463 --> 34:50.880
You know it.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.426
This is our best chance.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.888
There's no chance.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.308
Really.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.021
I mean, look where we are.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.066
I'm not gonna let you give up.

35:14.404 --> 35:17.782
I know you made...

35:17.866 --> 35:19.241
...a promise.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.413
I'm letting you off the hook.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.301
Let me go, Jack.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.078
I'm sorry.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.915
Don't be.

36:12.629 --> 36:15.005
Relax, breathe.
Come on, breathe.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.258
Breathe.
Okay. Good.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.802
Okay, ready?
You've gotta do a nice one.

36:19.886 --> 36:22.054
I can see it's close.
Go, go. Push!

36:23.682 --> 36:26.225
That's really good.
I think it's close. Come on.

36:26.601 --> 36:30.062
That's it. Okay. Good.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.690
I can see the top of its head.
You're almost there.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.693
Come on.
I can see it. Okay.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.195
You're almost there.
You're so close.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.282
Ready? Come on.
One more.

36:42.158 --> 36:45.119
Go, push! Push! Push! Push!

36:58.300 --> 37:02.344
Oh, my God, you have a little boy.
A little baby boy.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.764
Oh, come here.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.445
That's your baby boy.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.333
I have a son.
I have a son.

38:10.205 --> 38:23.217
Tell Shannon...

38:25.220 --> 38:27.554
Tell her...

41:59.601 --> 42:01.810
It's a beautiful, healthy baby.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.483
Wanna talk about it?

42:09.819 --> 42:11.695
Talk about what?

42:14.449 --> 42:16.283
Boone died, Jack.

42:18.161 --> 42:19.912
He didn't die.

42:22.916 --> 42:26.210
- He was murdered.
- What?

42:26.961 --> 42:27.961
Jack.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.881
Where are you going?

42:30.965 --> 42:32.799
To find John Locke.
