WEBVTT

00:02.463 --> 00:03.964
GUYS, WHY ARE WE
IN THE PRISON?

00:03.964 --> 00:05.176
I THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYING

00:05.176 --> 00:06.257
IN THE ABANDONED MINE SHAFTS
TONIGHT.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.678
WELL, SINCE YOU WERE LATE,

00:07.678 --> 00:09.390
WE MADE AN EXECUTIVE DECISION
WITHOUT YOU.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.631
AND MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
BE GOING ON DOUBLE DATES

00:10.631 --> 00:12.633
WITH MY EX-WIFE
AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.136
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO!
THERESA MADE ME.

00:15.136 --> 00:17.017
YOU THINK I LIKE
HANGING OUT WITH GRANT?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.559
(laughs)
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH YOU.

00:18.559 --> 00:20.020
YOU KNOW, MY BUDDY AND I
ARE GONNA SPLIT

00:20.020 --> 00:22.403
THE 96-OUNCE PORTERHOUSE.

00:23.904 --> 00:25.816
SO YOU REALLY CLIMBED
MOUNT EVEREST?

00:25.816 --> 00:28.949
I LOOKED OVER THE WORLD, MAN,
AND LET ME TELL YOU,

00:28.949 --> 00:30.651
IT'S WORTH SAVING.

00:30.651 --> 00:32.783
I HEAR YOU.
I'VE BEEN RECYCLING.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.826
THE WHOLE NIGHT WAS LIKE
A TRIP TO THE DENTIST.

00:35.826 --> 00:37.658
I BEGGED THERESA
TO GET ME OUT OF IT,

00:37.658 --> 00:39.460
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW YOUR SISTER GETS.

00:39.460 --> 00:42.463
I CANNOTBELIEVETHAT IS THE GUY
MY EX-WIFE PICKED.

00:42.463 --> 00:45.045
HEY, WILL, HAVE YOU HEARD
CRAIG'S IMPRESSION OF GRANT?

00:45.045 --> 00:48.048
(deep voice) "OH, I'M GRANT.
I'M TALL AND GOOD-LOOKING.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.221
I ENJOY VITAMINS AND EXERCISE."

00:50.221 --> 00:51.432
(laughing)

00:51.432 --> 00:52.843
IT'S SO TRUE! THAT'S HIM!

00:52.843 --> 00:54.675
OOH! OOH! DO WILL NOW.

00:54.675 --> 00:56.767
(imitates Southern accent)
GIT ON OUT OF THERE NOW!

00:56.767 --> 00:58.679
WHAT? I DON'T SOUND LIKE THAT.

00:58.679 --> 01:00.181
DUDE, CRAIG,
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

01:00.181 --> 01:01.232
(laughing)

01:01.232 --> 01:05.646
(slaps leg)

01:05.646 --> 01:07.148
(singsongy) HELLO, EVERYBODY!

01:07.148 --> 01:08.359
(singsongy) HELLO!

01:08.359 --> 01:10.111
HI, AUNT BRENDA.
(normal voice) HEY.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.322
LUCY, DO YOU WANNA TELL
AUNT BRENDA

01:11.322 --> 01:12.493
ALL ABOUT YOUR BIG NEWS?

01:12.493 --> 01:14.455
MY FRIEND AMBER
CAN SPIT IN THE AIR

01:14.455 --> 01:16.657
AND CATCH IT IN HER HAND.

01:16.657 --> 01:18.199
THAT'S AWESOME.

01:18.199 --> 01:20.291
NOT AS AWESOME AS OUR LITTLE
DOCTOR-TO-BE GETTING AN "A"

01:20.291 --> 01:21.502
ON HER SCIENCE TEST.

01:21.502 --> 01:23.794
(singsongy) CONGRATULATIONS.

01:23.794 --> 01:26.006
WHICH WE ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE
THIS SUNDAY AT FAMILY DINNER.

01:26.006 --> 01:27.168
YAY!

01:27.168 --> 01:28.129
GOOD MORNING.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.381
GOOD MORNING.
MMM. (kisses)

01:30.381 --> 01:32.133
YOU HEARD ABOUT THE "A"
OUR LITTLE GENIUS GOT?

01:32.133 --> 01:34.215
GOOD LORD, PEOPLE.
IT'S ONE TEST.

01:34.215 --> 01:35.556
OKAY, KIDS,
READY TO GO TO SCHOOL?

01:35.556 --> 01:38.389
I DON'T LIKE TO BE MORE THAN
20 MINUTES LATE FOR WORK.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.721
OH, BY THE WAY, I THINK...

01:40.721 --> 01:43.524
(singsongy) SOMEONE HAS
A MAN-CRUSH ON WILL.

01:43.524 --> 01:44.725
REALLY?

01:44.725 --> 01:46.187
GRANT LIKES ME?

01:46.187 --> 01:47.528
SEE YOU GUYS.

01:47.528 --> 01:48.729
(door closes)

01:48.729 --> 01:50.821
WOW. I HOPE
YOU WERE THIS EXCITED

01:50.821 --> 01:52.283
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
THATILIKED YOU.

01:52.283 --> 01:53.494
WHAT? WHAT AM I DOING?

01:53.494 --> 01:55.115
YOU'RE BEAMING!
I'M NOT BEAMING.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.328
(gasps) YOU'RE BEAMING.
I'M NOT BEAMING.

01:57.328 --> 01:58.499
I WONDER WHAT HE LIKES
ABOUT ME.

01:58.499 --> 01:59.950
(gasps) TONIGHT,
WE CAN MAKE A LIST.
MM.

01:59.950 --> 02:03.244
BUT FIRST YOU HAVE TO TELL KENNY
ABOUT SUNDAY DINNER.

02:03.244 --> 02:04.915
WHAT? WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:04.915 --> 02:06.337
GRANT'S COMING.

02:06.337 --> 02:07.708
YOU NEED TO TALK TO KENNY
SO HE DOESN'T FREAK OUT

02:07.708 --> 02:10.301
WHEN HE SEES THAT
HIS EX-WIFE'S NEW BOYFRIEND

02:10.301 --> 02:12.303
IS NOW PART
OF OUR FAMILY TRADITIONS.

02:12.303 --> 02:13.924
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

02:13.924 --> 02:16.517
WHY AM I THE ONE
WHO HAS TO TALK TO HIM?

02:16.517 --> 02:19.350
YOU ARE COMING TO FAMILY DINNER
THIS SUNDAY. NO EXCUSES.

02:19.350 --> 02:20.561
(clink)

02:22.142 --> 02:23.764
OH, YEAH.

02:23.764 --> 02:25.436
OKAY, FINE.
I'LL JUST TELL HIM,

02:25.436 --> 02:28.319
"KENNY, GRANT'S COMING
TO DINNER. DEAL WITH IT."

02:28.319 --> 02:30.361
YOU'RE GONNA BLAME IT ON ME,
AREN'T YOU?

02:30.361 --> 02:31.362
YES, I AM.
MM-HMM.

02:31.362 --> 02:32.613
GOOD-BYE.

02:35.236 --> 02:36.447
HEY, DUDE.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.658
HEY.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.079
I GOT YOUR TEXT. WHAT'S UP?

02:39.079 --> 02:42.243
UH, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING. SIT DOWN.

02:42.243 --> 02:43.244
(voice breaks) ARE YOU DYING?

02:43.244 --> 02:45.746
NO. IT'S ABOUT GRANT.

02:45.746 --> 02:46.747
(normal voice) ISHEDYING?

02:46.747 --> 02:48.249
(knock on door)
NO.

02:48.249 --> 02:50.881
AND THIS IS WILL KEEN. HE IS
IN CHARGE OF REGIONAL SALES.

02:50.881 --> 02:52.343
DAMN IT.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.385
STEVE, COME ON!

02:55.846 --> 02:57.218
(sighs) MR. EGGERT'S NEPHEW.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.260
HE'S SHADOWING ME ALL WEEK
SO I CAN SHOW HIM THE ROPES.

02:59.260 --> 03:00.721
HOW'S THAT GOING?

03:00.721 --> 03:02.142
REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL

03:02.142 --> 03:04.225
WHEN I SOILED MYSELF
AT THE INDOOR SKYDIVING PLACE?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.856
(Kenny groans)
YES.

03:05.856 --> 03:07.228
THIS IS WORSE.
DUDE, RELAX.

03:07.228 --> 03:09.770
I STOPPED TO GET A DOUGHNUT
OFF THE FAT GIRL'S DESK.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.232
HELLO, STEVE.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.573
CALL ME "EGGNOG."

03:12.573 --> 03:14.235
WHY DO THEY CALL YOU EGGNOG?

03:14.235 --> 03:15.616
NO, NO, NO. DON'T ASK HIM THAT--
♪ FROM THE EGG TO THE NOG ♪

03:15.616 --> 03:18.409
♪ LIKE A LOG IN A BOG-- ♪
STEVE! STOP.

03:18.409 --> 03:20.241
DUDE, IS THAT YOUR WIFE?

03:20.241 --> 03:21.242
YES, IT IS.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.243
(chuckles)

03:22.243 --> 03:23.624
YOU SEE THIS CHICK
HE GETS TO PLOW?

03:23.624 --> 03:25.165
OKAY, THAT'S IT. LET'S GO.

03:25.165 --> 03:27.538
I'VE SEEN HER EVERY DAY
OF MY LIFE. SHE'S MY SISTER.

03:27.538 --> 03:29.590
OKAY, JUST GO, PLEASE. GOD.

03:29.590 --> 03:32.503
UGH!

03:32.503 --> 03:34.795
THAT GUYISWORSE
THAN THE INDOOR SKYDIVING PLACE.

03:34.795 --> 03:36.096
AT LEAST
THEN WE GOT A VIDEO.

03:36.096 --> 03:37.968
(flaps lips)

03:37.968 --> 03:39.510
"STOP THE FANS!"

03:39.510 --> 03:41.262
(laughs) THAT WAS...

03:41.262 --> 03:42.393
YEAH, GOOD TIMES.

03:42.393 --> 03:43.604
YEAH.

03:43.604 --> 03:45.015
SO...

03:45.015 --> 03:46.397
YEAH?

03:46.397 --> 03:48.269
DID WILL TELL YOU YET?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.481
TELL ME... WHAT?

03:50.481 --> 03:52.693
(whispers) I DON'T KNOW.

03:52.693 --> 03:56.737
OKAY, LOOK, GRANT IS COMING
TO FAMILY DINNER THIS SUNDAY.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.279
WHAT?!

03:58.279 --> 04:00.321
UNACCEPTABLE.

04:00.321 --> 04:01.622
I KNOW, I KNOW! AND THAT'S
WHAT I TOLD THERESA...

04:01.622 --> 04:02.823
MM-HMM.

04:02.823 --> 04:04.705
BUT SHE INSISTED.
I--MY HANDS ARE TIED.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.367
MM-HMM. SO UNTIE THEM, OKAY?

04:06.367 --> 04:07.708
YOU DON'T WANT THAT JERK
IN YOUR HOUSE.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.290
WELL, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY--

04:09.290 --> 04:10.331
"ACTUALLY" WHAT?

04:10.331 --> 04:12.132
I LIKE HIM, OKAY?

04:12.132 --> 04:13.714
WE'RE FRIENDS.

04:13.714 --> 04:15.336
YOU'RE FRIENDS?
(chuckles)

04:15.336 --> 04:16.377
(sighs)
FRIENDS.

04:16.377 --> 04:18.258
(scoffs)
YOU HEARING THIS, CRAIG?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.840
OH, I'M HEARING IT.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.472
ACTUALLY,
I KINDA LIKE HIM, TOO.

04:21.472 --> 04:23.013
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING TIME
WITH HIM?

04:23.013 --> 04:24.094
A LITTLE.

04:25.476 --> 04:26.437
(giggles)

04:26.437 --> 04:27.648
KICK, BUDDY. KEEP YOUR HEAD UP.
GOOD JOB!

04:27.648 --> 04:29.350
(giggles)

04:29.350 --> 04:30.811
HE'S TEACHING ME TO SWIM.

04:30.811 --> 04:32.152
HE'S A WONDERFUL SWIMMER.

04:32.152 --> 04:33.314
(whispers) WOW.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.356
(normal voice)
I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE

04:35.356 --> 04:37.568
FROM A MAN THAT I OWE
THREE MONTHS BACK RENT TO.

04:37.568 --> 04:41.241
HEY, GRANT IS A GOOD GUY, KENNY,
AND HE'S IMPORTANT TO BRENDA,

04:41.241 --> 04:43.163
SO HE'S JUST GONNA BE PART
OF OUR LIVES NOW.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.164
I SEE.

04:44.164 --> 04:45.536
OH! OKAY!
KENNY.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.957
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
FINE!

04:46.957 --> 04:48.329
(Craig) UH, YOU KNOW...
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!

04:48.329 --> 04:50.751
YOU GUYS LIKE HIM SO MUCH?
FINE!

04:50.751 --> 04:52.082
I'M OUTTA HERE!

04:52.082 --> 04:53.374
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:53.374 --> 04:55.376
I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE
A NICE LIFE TOGETHER

04:55.376 --> 04:57.177
AS THE THREE DOUCHE-KATEERS!

04:57.177 --> 04:59.760
KENNY.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.514
UHH! (muttering)

05:03.514 --> 05:06.096
WOW.
NOT HIS BEST PARTING INSULT.

05:06.096 --> 05:08.018
BETTER THAN WHEN HE CALLED US
SIMON AND BUTTFUNKEL

05:08.018 --> 05:09.350
AT MY WEDDING.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.431
HMM.

05:16.236 --> 05:19.279
ANOTHER TEXT FROM KENNY.

05:19.279 --> 05:21.281
"I HOPE YOU, GRANT,
AND CRAIG HAVE FUN

05:21.281 --> 05:23.243
AS THE THREE ASS-MIGOS."

05:23.243 --> 05:26.326
THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS IS
TO GET KENNY TO ACCEPT GRANT.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.999
I NEED TO FINESSE
SOME KIND OF BROMANCE.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.250
YOU THINK MY FATHER

05:30.250 --> 05:31.452
EVER WOULD'VE USED
THE WORD "BROMANCE"?

05:31.452 --> 05:32.623
NO,

05:32.623 --> 05:34.835
BUT HE ALSO NEVER SAT
ON A COUNTER WEARING FLIP-FLOPS,

05:34.835 --> 05:37.628
EATING A YOGURT PARFAIT,
AND SWINGING HIS LEGS

05:39.460 --> 05:42.262
MY DAD WOULD'VE MADE THEM
HASH IT OUT IN THE BACKYARD

05:42.262 --> 05:43.424
LIKE A COUPLE OF MEN.

05:43.424 --> 05:47.017
AND BY THE WAY, GLADIATORS
USED TO WEAR FLIP-FLOPS.

05:47.017 --> 05:48.599
THEY JUST CALLED THEM SANDALS.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.641
(Theresa gasps) LUCY! HEY!

05:50.641 --> 05:52.473
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
AT THE MALL WITH YOUR AUNT B.?

05:52.473 --> 05:54.685
IT WAS AWESOME.
YEAH?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.647
BRENDA, I NEED TO MAKE KENNY
WANNA BE FRIENDS WITH GRANT.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.819
NOW YOU GUYS KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN ANYBODY.

05:58.819 --> 06:00.401
WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.863
WELL, THEY BOTH BREATHE OXYGEN
AND HAVE HAD SEX WITH BRENDA.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.284
OH, BUT THAT DESCRIBES
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

06:04.284 --> 06:05.746
(chuckles)
TRUE.

06:05.746 --> 06:07.488
WILL, THESE GUYS COULDN'T BE
MORE DIFFERENT.

06:07.488 --> 06:09.289
ONE'S TALL, ONE'S KENNY.

06:09.289 --> 06:11.251
ONE'S ATHLETIC, ONE'S KENNY.

06:11.251 --> 06:13.333
ONE'S NEVER SEEN "STAR WARS,"

06:13.333 --> 06:16.126
ONE WANTS TO NAME HIS FIRSTBORN
HAN SOLO,

06:16.126 --> 06:17.418
EVEN IF IT'S A GIRL.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.800
WAIT, GRANT HASNEVERSEEN
"STAR WARS"?

06:19.800 --> 06:21.261
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

06:21.261 --> 06:24.465
HE WAS BUSY HAVING SEX
WITH WOMEN AND NOT BEING A NERD.

06:24.465 --> 06:26.096
"STAR WARS." HUH.

06:27.307 --> 06:30.140
LUCY, WHAT IS THAT
ON YOUR BACK?

06:30.140 --> 06:33.063
OH, AUNT BRENDA GOT IT FOR ME
'CAUSE OF MY "A" IN SCIENCE.

06:33.063 --> 06:35.646
NOW WE BOTH HAVE
MATCHING TATTOOS!

06:35.646 --> 06:37.818
(chuckles)

06:37.818 --> 06:39.019
(sighs)

06:39.019 --> 06:41.281
IT'S HENNA. IT WASHES OFF
IN A FEW WEEKS.

06:41.281 --> 06:43.864
IT'S A TRAMP STAMP...
ON A 7-YEAR-OLD.

06:43.864 --> 06:46.527
LUCY, I THINK MOMMY WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO AUNT BRENDA ALONE.

06:46.527 --> 06:50.240
I THINK AUNT BRENDA WOULD LIKE
PEOPLE TO STAY IN THE ROOM.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.452
BRENDA, DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT KIND OF A MESSAGE

06:51.452 --> 06:53.534
A TATTOO LIKE THAT SENDS?

06:53.534 --> 06:54.705
UH, YEAH.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.588
IT SENDS A MESSAGE
THAT SHE'S A 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL

06:57.588 --> 06:59.209
WHO WANTED
A LITTLE DECORATION.

06:59.209 --> 07:02.422
GIRLS WHO GET TRAMP STAMPS ARE
NOT GIRLS WHO BECOME DOCTORS.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.425
THE WIND UP STANDING ON TABLES,
TOPLESS,

07:05.425 --> 07:08.048
WITH PEOPLE THRUSTING
DOLLAR BILLS AT THEM.

07:08.048 --> 07:09.550
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.512
I HAVE A TATTOO.
HAVE I EVER DONE THAT?

07:11.512 --> 07:14.054
SPRING BREAK, DAYTONA BEACH,
SOPHOMORE YEAR OF COLLEGE.

07:14.054 --> 07:15.395
ISOLATED INCIDENT.

07:15.395 --> 07:17.768
SPRING BREAK, DAYTONA BEACH,
JUNIOR YEAR OF COLLEGE.

07:17.768 --> 07:19.480
ANOTHER ISOLATED INCIDENT.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.561
WINTER BREAK, DAYTONA BEACH--

07:20.561 --> 07:22.773
ISOLATED INCIDENT. (chuckles)

07:22.773 --> 07:25.195
I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY.

07:27.528 --> 07:29.870
(singsongy) HEY, KENNY.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.452
(door closes)

07:32.452 --> 07:35.916
LISTEN, CRAIG AND I FEEL BAD
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.337
YOU MEAN WHEN
YOU BOTH BETRAYED ME

07:37.337 --> 07:39.209
AND VIOLATED 23 YEARS
OF FRIENDSHIP?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.921
(can hisses)

07:40.921 --> 07:42.713
SO WE BROUGHT YOU
THOSE NOODLES YOU LOVE

07:42.713 --> 07:44.885
FROM... (singsongy)
GUESS WHERE?

07:44.885 --> 07:46.466
COCK-A-NOODLE DOO.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.678
(mutters)

07:47.678 --> 07:49.049
AND THE LATEST ISSUE
OF "KUNG FU" MAGAZINE.

07:49.049 --> 07:50.470
IT'S GOT AN ARTICLE CALLED

07:50.470 --> 07:52.222
"SUPER COOL TRICKS
FOR BREAKING BIG BRICKS."

07:52.222 --> 07:55.225
AND HERE'S A MODEL
OF TOM PETTY'S CAR.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.227
I KNOW YOU REALLY LIKE IT.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.690
I LIKERICHARDPETTY'S CAR.

07:59.690 --> 08:00.901
OH!
OH. IT MAKES SENSE.

08:00.901 --> 08:02.312
OH, I WONDERED WHY YOU WANTED
A TOY PRIUS.

08:02.312 --> 08:03.564
OKAY, I CAN TAKE IT BACK.

08:03.564 --> 08:05.906
NO, THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.569
OOH, IT'S GOT
THE CARPOOL DECAL.

08:08.569 --> 08:10.280
MM.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.322
SO HEY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

08:12.322 --> 08:14.575
WHY DON'T WE WATCH "STAR WARS"
THIS AFTERNOON?

08:14.575 --> 08:16.957
I ALREADY WATCHED IT
THIS MORNING...

08:16.957 --> 08:18.378
SO ABSOLUTELY.

08:18.378 --> 08:19.670
CRAIG, GET THE SHADES.

08:19.670 --> 08:22.172
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING
I BROUGHT.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.624
COME ON IN, GRANT!

08:23.624 --> 08:25.886
THIS WAS TOTALLY WILL'S IDEA.

08:25.886 --> 08:27.087
(grunts)

08:27.087 --> 08:29.089
(closes door)

08:29.089 --> 08:30.931
HI, KENNY.

08:30.931 --> 08:34.014
I GOT YOU STEVE PERRY'S
FJ CRUISER.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.136
(exhales sharply)

08:36.136 --> 08:38.138
AND I CAN SEE BY THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE I'M WAY OFF.

08:38.138 --> 08:39.900
(strained voice)
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?!

08:39.900 --> 08:43.523
LISTEN TO ME. HE HAS NEVER SEEN
"STAR WARS" BEFORE.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.355
(grunts)
HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO,
AND I TOLD HIM

08:45.355 --> 08:46.987
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO SHOULD SHOW IT TO HIM.

08:46.987 --> 08:48.528
KENNY...

08:48.528 --> 08:50.991
YOU CAN TAKE
HIS "STAR"-GINITY.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.246
(normal voice) IS THIS TRUE,

08:56.246 --> 08:58.749
YOU'VE...NEVERSEEN
"STAR WARS"?

08:58.749 --> 09:00.581
I HEAR IT'S A WONDERFUL FILM.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.422
(scoffs)
KENNY, PLEASE.

09:02.422 --> 09:07.217
SHOW THIS GUY THE GREATEST MOVIE
EVER MADE AND BLOW HIS MIND.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.299
(whispers)
BLOW HIS MIND, KENNY.

09:10.671 --> 09:14.344
OKAY. I JUST NEED
TO PUT SOME PANTS ON.

09:16.266 --> 09:19.519
(imitates lightsaber humming)

09:19.519 --> 09:23.483
IN 1977,
A 33-YEAR-OLD GEORGE LUCAS

09:23.483 --> 09:26.396
HAD A VISION OF A GALAXY
FAR, FAR AWAY.

09:26.396 --> 09:27.988
(imitates Darth Vader's
breathing)

09:27.988 --> 09:31.111
TODAY, I'M GOING
TO SHOW THIS VISION TO YOU

09:31.111 --> 09:34.574
IN ITS PURIST FORM, THE WAY
IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN--

09:34.574 --> 09:36.116
ON BETAMAX. CRAIG?

09:38.458 --> 09:42.623
(both sing indistinctly,
high-pitched voices)

09:42.623 --> 09:47.127
THIS IS AN ORIGINAL
1982 RENTAL-ONLY BETAMAX COPY

09:47.127 --> 09:49.589
OF LUCAS' MASTERPIECE.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.673
IT'S INCREDIBLY RARE
AND INCREDIBLY VALUABLE,

09:52.673 --> 09:54.264
ALTHOUGH
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR

09:54.264 --> 09:56.596
BECAUSE I ONCE SPILLED
HAWAIIAN PUNCH ON IT.

09:59.559 --> 10:02.062
(imitates
lightsaber whooshing)

10:02.062 --> 10:03.644
(imitates lightsaber hum)

10:03.644 --> 10:04.524
BOOP!

10:06.316 --> 10:07.688
CAN I ASK A QUESTION?

10:07.688 --> 10:09.650
(click)

10:09.650 --> 10:10.941
IF THIS IS IN A GALAXY
FAR, FAR AWAY,

10:10.941 --> 10:13.323
WOULDN'T THEY BE SPEAKING
IN AN ALIEN LANGUAGE?

10:13.323 --> 10:14.695
(moans softly)

10:14.695 --> 10:16.657
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
VERY GOOD QUESTION, GRANT.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.288
HOW ABOUT THAT, KENNY?

10:18.288 --> 10:20.701
KIND OF FUN TO HAVE SOME
FRESH EYES ON THIS MOVIE, HUH?

10:20.701 --> 10:21.662
(scoffs)

10:21.662 --> 10:25.045
THE TRANSLATION IS SIMPLY
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND

10:25.045 --> 10:26.626
THE TEXT OF THE FILM.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.548
IF IT WERE IN THE NATIVE TONGUE
OF TATOOINE,

10:28.548 --> 10:30.590
WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TOFOLLOW IT.

10:30.590 --> 10:31.962
OH, WE COULD READ SUBTITLES.

10:31.962 --> 10:33.674
GRANT, JUST GO WITH IT.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.556
(click)

10:38.809 --> 10:41.221
WHAT'S THAT LITTLE ROBOT'S NAME?
HE'S CUTE.

10:41.221 --> 10:45.686
HIS NAME IS R2-D2.
HE'S NOT A ROBOT. HE'S A DROID.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.318
(gasps) OHH.

10:49.609 --> 10:51.191
I HAVE A ROOMBA.

10:54.614 --> 10:55.615
(click)

11:00.951 --> 11:02.452
THAT'S THE GUY
FROM "AIR FORCE ONE."

11:02.452 --> 11:05.205
THAT'S IT!
I CAN'T WATCH IT ANYMORE!

11:05.205 --> 11:06.626
YOU WANNA WATCH
"BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE" INSTEAD?

11:06.626 --> 11:08.048
KENNY, CALM DOWN.

11:08.048 --> 11:10.000
WILL... "AIR FORCE ONE"?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.793
THAT'SWHERE HE RECOGNIZES
HARRISON FORD FROM?!

11:12.793 --> 11:14.214
HE WAS ALSO
IN "REGARDING HENRY,"

11:14.214 --> 11:16.596
AND I BELIEVE HE'S MARRIED
TO ALLY McBEAL.

11:16.596 --> 11:18.258
(imitates lightsaber
powering down) SHOW'S OVER.

11:19.639 --> 11:20.761
KENNY...

11:20.761 --> 11:21.972
ALLYMcBEAL.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.183
(lightsaber clatters)

11:23.183 --> 11:26.266
(muttering)

11:26.266 --> 11:28.358
OH, CRAP.

11:28.358 --> 11:29.609
MY TAPE IS STUCK.

11:29.609 --> 11:32.072
(rattles)
OH, NO. MY TAPE.

11:32.072 --> 11:34.654
OH, GOD! POP IT!

11:34.654 --> 11:36.236
POP UP!POP UP!

11:36.236 --> 11:38.488
MY TAPE. (groans) POP UP!

11:38.488 --> 11:40.160
(Will) DON'T--DON'T FORCE IT.
DON'T FORCE IT, KENNY.
(Craig) NO, NO, NO.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.451
COME ON! WORK WITH ME!
YOU'VE GOTTA--

11:41.451 --> 11:42.622
OH, SWEETIE!

11:42.622 --> 11:44.244
KENNY, KENNY, KENNY, SLOW DOWN.
OKAY. HOLD IT.

11:44.244 --> 11:46.286
NO, DON'T YOU--DON'T YOU PUT
YOUR DIRTY HANDS ON HER!

11:48.789 --> 11:50.500
(cell phone rings)

11:50.500 --> 11:52.042
(ring)

11:52.042 --> 11:53.213
(beep)
HELLO?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.384
SO I WAS THINKING,

11:54.384 --> 11:56.596
YOU--YOU AND BRENDA
ARE IN A FIGHT.

11:56.596 --> 11:59.099
MAYBE WE SHOULD CANCEL
FAMILY DINNER TOMORROW.

11:59.099 --> 12:00.720
NO! IT'S FINE.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.643
I THINK I WAS JUST OVERREACTING
TO THE HENNA TATTOO.

12:03.643 --> 12:04.935
I'M SURE IT'S HARMLESS.

12:04.935 --> 12:06.767
AAH!
(electricity crackling)

12:06.767 --> 12:08.648
UHH!

12:08.648 --> 12:10.851
OH, I GOT ZAPPED.
I GOT ZAPPED.

IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

12:38.718 --> 12:41.721
AN EMERGENCY, HUH? GAY PORN?

12:41.721 --> 12:42.722
HOMEMADE?

12:42.722 --> 12:44.144

12:55.195 --> 12:56.776
TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.
(scoffs)

12:56.776 --> 12:58.528
(whispers) IT'S "STAR WARS."

12:58.528 --> 13:02.242
OH! YOU GUYS DRESSED
AS "STAR WARS" CHARACTERS,

13:02.242 --> 13:04.114
PLAYING
WITH YOUR LIGHTSABERS?

13:04.114 --> 13:05.996
COULD YOU JUST GET
THE TAPE OUT FOR US?

13:05.996 --> 13:10.170
OH, FINE.
GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES. (sighs)

13:10.170 --> 13:12.332
(scoffs)

13:12.332 --> 13:13.874
I'MTHE GAY ONE?

13:13.874 --> 13:15.876
SERIOUSLY, OF THE FOUR OF US,

13:15.876 --> 13:18.718
I PROBABLY HAVE
THE MOST EXPERIENCE WITH WOMEN.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.681
RIDICULOUS.

13:23.723 --> 13:25.555
(telephone ringing)

13:25.555 --> 13:28.849
HELLO, LADIES! WHAT'S UP?

13:28.849 --> 13:31.311
LUCY, HONEY, TELL AUNT BRENDA

13:31.311 --> 13:35.275
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
A REAL TATTOO.

13:36.776 --> 13:38.028
FIX THIS.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.492
(door opens)

13:42.492 --> 13:44.364
(sighs)

13:44.364 --> 13:46.786
YOUR SEX TAPE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

13:48.538 --> 13:51.251
(groans and whimpers)

13:51.251 --> 13:54.834
(crying)

13:54.834 --> 13:56.166
THIS ISYOURFAULT!

13:56.166 --> 13:58.048
IF YOU HADN'T TRIED

13:58.048 --> 14:00.550
TO FORCE ME TO BE FRIENDS
WITH THE SCORPION KING

14:00.550 --> 14:03.263
AND ALL
OF HIS STUPID QUESTIONS,

14:03.263 --> 14:04.965
MY TAPE WOULD STILL BE HERE.

14:04.965 --> 14:07.307
I'M SORRY, KENNY. THERE WERE
A LOT OF THINGS IN THAT MOVIE

14:07.307 --> 14:08.728
THAT JUST DIDN'T TRACK FOR ME.

14:08.728 --> 14:11.431
YOU WANNA TRACK SOMETHING?
TRACK THIS.

14:11.431 --> 14:14.234
IF THIS WERE A TRACK MEET,
I'D BE RUNNING...

14:14.234 --> 14:16.977
AWAY FROM ALL OF YOU...

14:16.977 --> 14:17.978
(whispers)
ANDI'DCOME IN FIRST.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.402
GOOD DAY!

14:23.944 --> 14:26.116
(slams opens door)

14:31.661 --> 14:34.664
WELL, THE TABLE SEEMS
A LITTLE LONG, DOESN'T IT, BOYS?

14:34.664 --> 14:36.206
HENRY VIII COMING?

14:36.206 --> 14:37.547
KENNY SITS THERE.
GRANT SITS DOWN THERE.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.169
WE'LL PUT
A BIG FLORAL ARRANGEMENT

14:39.169 --> 14:40.380
RIGHT IN THE CENTER.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.092
I TALKED TO KENNY, ALL RIGHT?

14:42.092 --> 14:44.554
HE SAID THAT HE'S READY
TO BURY THE HATCHET.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.466
WAIT. DID HE SAY "BURY"
OR "BRING"?

14:46.466 --> 14:49.389
BECAUSE THE GUY OWNS, LIKE,
150 HATCHETS.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.810
IT'LL BE FINE.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.062
(door opens)

14:52.062 --> 14:53.473
(Kenny, singsongy) HELLO!

14:53.473 --> 14:55.065
BING-BONG!

14:55.065 --> 14:56.226
(normal voice) HEY, GUYS!

14:56.226 --> 14:58.318
HEY, MAN.
(chuckles) HI.

14:58.318 --> 15:01.571
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, BUT, UH,
I INVITED A GUEST OVER TONIGHT.

15:01.571 --> 15:02.822
(door closes)

15:04.444 --> 15:06.286
OH. NO. (sighs)

15:06.286 --> 15:08.368
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:08.368 --> 15:11.331
IF YOU GET TO ADD A FRIEND TO
OUR GROUP, THEN I GET TO, TOO.

15:11.331 --> 15:13.373
DUDE, YOU SAID WE WERE GOING
TO LASER TAG.

15:13.373 --> 15:14.834
THIS PLACE SUCKS!

15:14.834 --> 15:16.706
EVERYONE HERE IS OLD.

15:16.706 --> 15:21.501
(laughing)

15:23.713 --> 15:25.715
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY CREAM SODA?

15:25.715 --> 15:28.218
NOTHING HERE IS TO DRINK.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.509
(laughing)

15:29.509 --> 15:30.971
(Will) OKAY. AHEM.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.603
WELL, I'M SO GLAD
THAT MOST OF YOU ARE HERE,

15:33.603 --> 15:37.267
AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST
TO FRIENDSHIP.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.440
YES, WE ALSO WANT TO TOAST LUCY,
OUR LITTLE DOCTOR.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.272
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A DOCTOR ANYMORE.

15:42.272 --> 15:43.523
WHAT? WHY NOT?

15:43.523 --> 15:46.196
YOUR HENNA TATTOO WILL
WASH OFF IN A FEW WEEKS,

15:46.196 --> 15:49.449
BUT IF YOU GET A REAL TATTOO
AND YOU DON'T WANT IT ANYMORE,

15:49.449 --> 15:53.203
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO GET RID OF IT.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.246
(laser zapping)
(crying)

15:58.168 --> 16:01.961
AUNT BRENDA SHOWED ME
THAT DOCTORS HURT PEOPLE...

16:01.961 --> 16:04.134
WITHLASERS.

16:04.134 --> 16:05.295
(chuckles)

16:05.295 --> 16:07.347
AT LEAST SHE DOESN'T WANT
A TATTOO.

16:07.347 --> 16:11.261
EGGNOG, MAKE THAT PTERODACTYL
SOUND YOU MADE IN THE CAR.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.804
(imitates
pterodactyl screeching)

16:17.727 --> 16:19.519
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, KENNY?

16:19.519 --> 16:21.401
YOU'RE A CHILD.
I'M A CHILD?

16:21.401 --> 16:23.273
HA. YEAH.
OKAY.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.444
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO STARTED THIS

16:24.444 --> 16:26.196
WHEN YOU BROUGHT
THETAPE BREAKER

16:26.196 --> 16:27.907
INTO OUR FAMILY HERE.
(scoffs)
I DIDN'T BREAK THE TAPE.

16:27.907 --> 16:29.319
I SIMPLY HAD A QUESTION

16:29.319 --> 16:31.071
ABOUT THE LITTLE BLUE ROBOT
BEEP BOOP-BOOP.

16:31.071 --> 16:32.992
I--YOU...
(fork clinks and clatters)

16:32.992 --> 16:34.784
OHH.
(utensils clatter)

16:34.784 --> 16:38.578
OKAY, HIS NAME IS R2-D2,
AND HE'S A DROID, NOT A ROBOT.

16:38.578 --> 16:39.789
OKAY, GUYS.

16:39.789 --> 16:41.711
IS THERE A DIFFERENCE?

16:41.711 --> 16:43.463
YES. A DROID IS
A CONSCIOUS MECHANICAL BEING

16:43.463 --> 16:45.755
WITH A SELF-CONTAINED METHOD
OFLOCOMOTION!

16:45.755 --> 16:47.337
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A ROBOT
TO ME.

16:47.337 --> 16:48.548
WELL YOU SOUND LIKE
A JERK-BOT TO ME!

16:48.548 --> 16:50.760
OKAY, THAT'S IT. I'M DONE.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.392
YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING
TO GET YOU GUYS TO BE FRIENDS,

16:52.392 --> 16:54.054
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU DON'T LIKE EACH OTHER,

16:54.054 --> 16:56.436
THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
HASH IT OUT LIKE MEN.

16:56.436 --> 16:59.269
FINE.
I'M HAPPY TO FIGHT HIM.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.401
GREAT.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

17:01.401 --> 17:03.773
THIS IS AWESOME!
A SUPER LONG TABLEANDA FIGHT!

17:03.773 --> 17:05.445
WILL! KIDS, TO THE DEN.
(pounds tabletop)

17:05.445 --> 17:07.277
(Nathan) WHAT?
BUT UNCLE KENNY
IS ABOUT TO DIE!

17:07.277 --> 17:09.109
NOW!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:09.109 --> 17:11.491
UNCLE KENNY IS NOT GONNA DIE
TODAY, LITTLE ONE. COME ON!

17:11.491 --> 17:13.413
WILL, STOP THIS.
NO, NO, NO.
THEY HAVE TO SETTLE THIS,

17:13.413 --> 17:15.865
AND IF THAT MEANS FIGHTING,
SO BE IT.

17:15.865 --> 17:17.787
KENNY, YOU DO NOT WANNA
DO THIS.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.499
OHH,YES, I DO.

17:19.499 --> 17:21.541
(Theresa)
KIDS, GO TO THE DEN NOW.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.463
I WON'T FIGHT YOU, KENNY.
OH, YEAH?

17:23.463 --> 17:25.505
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF
THAT BEFORE YOU BROKE MYTAPE!

17:25.505 --> 17:28.128
OKAY,
COUPLE GROUND RULES.

17:28.128 --> 17:31.261
NO BITING, NO GOUGING,

17:31.261 --> 17:32.512
NO BALL PLAY,

17:32.512 --> 17:33.723
AND--WAIT A MINUTE.

17:33.723 --> 17:34.934
OH!
(gasps)

17:34.934 --> 17:36.136
(muffled voice) COME ON!
(sputters)

17:36.136 --> 17:38.138
UM, GRANT,
I THINK YOU'RE KILLING HIM.

17:38.138 --> 17:39.729
I USED TO WORK
WITH DISTURBED ANIMALS...

17:39.729 --> 17:42.682
(grunting)
MOSTLY AGGRESSIVE DOGS
AND VERBALLY ABUSIVE PARROTS.

17:42.682 --> 17:45.395
THE BEST THING TO DO WHEN
THEY BECAUSE OVERSTIMULATED

17:45.395 --> 17:47.687
IS TO SUBDUE THEM
UNTIL THEIR RAGE DISSIPATES.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.399
(groans)

17:49.399 --> 17:52.402
PLEASE LET ME GO.
MY RAGE HAS DISSIPATED.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.494
NO, IT HASN'T.
YOU'RE FAKING IT.

17:56.656 --> 17:57.957
SON OF A--
(grunts)

17:57.957 --> 17:59.369
(grunting)

17:59.369 --> 18:02.582
(whines)

18:02.582 --> 18:04.374
SHH. SHH.
OH!

18:04.374 --> 18:06.206
MM.

18:06.206 --> 18:08.168
(whispers) OKAY.

18:08.168 --> 18:09.879
(normal voice) I'M CALM NOW.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.423
GOOD BOY.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.805
(breathing heavily)

18:15.805 --> 18:17.887
I'M SORRY!

18:17.887 --> 18:19.018
OKAY?

18:19.018 --> 18:20.560
SORRY.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.982
IT'S JUST THAT ME AND CRAIG
AND WILL,

18:22.982 --> 18:25.935
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS
SINCE MR. WATRELL'S SHOP CLASS.

18:25.935 --> 18:28.438
AND NOWHE'SHERE,

18:28.438 --> 18:30.440
AND YOU GOT PEOPLE TO
GO ON YOUR DOUBLE DATES WITH

18:30.440 --> 18:33.403
AND TO BRING
TO YOUR FAMILY DINNERS AND...

18:33.403 --> 18:34.694
I-I GOT WORRIED.

18:36.196 --> 18:37.407
JUST FORGET IT.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.583
(coughs) WUSSY!

18:43.583 --> 18:47.207
KENNY, KENNY, NOBODY'S TRYING
TO REPLACE YOU.

18:47.207 --> 18:48.628
IT'S JUST THAT I--

18:48.628 --> 18:50.009
GRANT'S A GOOD GUY,

18:50.009 --> 18:52.091
AND--AND HE'S GONNA
BE AROUND NOW.

18:52.091 --> 18:55.965
SO, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALWAYS
GONNA BE MY BEST FRIEND.

18:55.965 --> 18:58.258
WILL, YOU SAID THAT--

18:58.258 --> 18:59.519
CRAIG.

18:59.519 --> 19:02.101
I GET IT. MAKING A POINT.

19:02.101 --> 19:04.224
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, TOO,
KENNY.

19:04.224 --> 19:05.645
(mouths words)

19:05.645 --> 19:07.607
(whispers) RIGHT.

19:07.607 --> 19:10.650
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR "STAR WAR" TAPE, KENNY.

19:11.441 --> 19:15.535
IT'S "STARWARS."PLURAL.

19:15.535 --> 19:18.618
AND IT'S FINE.
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

19:18.618 --> 19:20.780
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT, I'D LIKE
TO BUY YOU ANOTHER TAPE.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.993
W--Y-- (laughs) YOU CAN'T
JUST BUY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:23.993 --> 19:26.165
THAT'S A FIRST EDITION
BETAMAX.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.587
YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE WOULD DO
FOR THAT?

19:27.587 --> 19:31.711
THEY'D STEAL, THEY'D CHEAT,
THEY'D...

19:31.711 --> 19:34.844
THEY WOULD LIE
AND SAY THAT YOUR VCR ATE IT.

19:34.844 --> 19:37.597
THAT OLD MAN NEVER DID
GIVE US THAT TAPE BACK.

19:37.597 --> 19:39.178
LET'S RIDE!

19:41.140 --> 19:42.512
LET ME GO! AAH!

19:42.512 --> 19:44.604
NOT UNTIL YOU'RE CALM.
(grunts)

19:44.604 --> 19:45.565
(groans)

19:45.565 --> 19:47.647
AHH. (pants)

19:47.647 --> 19:49.269
THAT TAPE IS
UNDER THE COUNTER.

19:49.269 --> 19:50.520
AH, HA HA!

19:50.520 --> 19:52.572
GOOD BOY.

19:52.572 --> 19:54.484
(sighs)

19:55.775 --> 19:57.617
F.Y.I., MISTER.

19:57.617 --> 19:59.989
I'VE HAD SEXUAL CONTACT
WITH OVER 34 FEMALES,

19:59.989 --> 20:01.741
I ALMOST APPLIED
TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY,

20:01.741 --> 20:04.664
AND I ONCE RODE ON THE BACK
OF MY UNCLE DON'S HARLEY.

20:04.664 --> 20:06.456
DOES THAT SOUND GAY TO YOU?

20:08.628 --> 20:10.089
DIDN'T THINK SO.

20:11.671 --> 20:13.253
LET'S HIT IT.

20:15.595 --> 20:18.798
♪♪♪

20:21.551 --> 20:23.553
(thud, clatter)

20:37.116 --> 20:38.318
IN THE YEAR 2000,

20:38.318 --> 20:39.619
MIDDLE-AGED DIRECTOR
RAJA GOSNELL

20:39.619 --> 20:41.030
HAD A BOLD VISION

20:41.030 --> 20:42.622
OF AN OVERWEIGHT MOMMA
WHO HAD A HOUSE.

20:42.622 --> 20:45.705
TODAY I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU
THAT VISION--

20:45.705 --> 20:48.748
"BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE," THE WAY
IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN--

20:48.748 --> 20:53.633
ON BASIC CABLE WITH MANY
COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.545
(Craig, Kenny, and Will
laughing)

20:55.545 --> 20:56.966
OH, WATCH THIS. WATCH THIS.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.718
NOW SHE HAS TO PRETEND
SHE'S A MIDWIFE.

20:58.718 --> 21:00.009
(both laugh)

21:00.009 --> 21:01.841
CAN YOU BELIEVE THE LUCK
BIG MOMMA'S HAVING?

21:01.841 --> 21:04.013
I'M SORRY,

21:04.013 --> 21:05.345
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT
THIS INTELLIGENT YOUNG WOMAN IS

21:05.345 --> 21:07.847
COMPLETELY UNAWARE THAT THE MAN
SHE'S FALLING IN LOVE WITH

21:07.847 --> 21:11.270
IS ALSO HER OBESE,
BASKETBALL-DUNKING GRANDMOTHER?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.652
DON'T GET HUNG UP ON PLOT.

21:12.652 --> 21:17.357
JUST ENJOY THE GIGANTIC FAKE
BOOBS GETTING CAUGHT IN STUFF.

21:17.357 --> 21:18.778
(laughs)

21:18.778 --> 21:20.450
OH, BIG MOMMA, YOU CRAZY!

21:20.450 --> 21:22.322
I REALLY WANNA BOND WITH YOU,
BUT SERIOUSLY, FELLAS,

21:22.322 --> 21:23.703
WHAT'S THE LAST BOOK
YOU ALL READ?

21:26.326 --> 21:28.368
(inhales sharply)
