00:14.015 --> 00:15.848

00:31.565 --> 00:34.533

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:36.068

00:36.070 --> 00:37.803

<i>- Ahoy.</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:39.138

00:39.140 --> 00:41.573
- <i>Skully.</i>
<i>- Ahoy.</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:45.611
Yooo, yo-ho.

<i>¶ And join the crew </i>

00:58.658 --> 00:59.892
Yo-ho, let's go.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.593
Ha-har.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.696
Ahoy, mateys.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.199
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.835 --> 01:09.835
Great.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.503
To start today's adventure,

01:11.505 --> 01:14.073
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:14.075 --> 01:16.108
Yo-ho ho.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.178
- [all] Yo-ho ho.
- One more time.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.213
Yo-ho ho.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.886
<i>[Jake]</i> "Cubby's Mixed-Up Map."

01:27.888 --> 01:29.455
[Cubby] Check it out, mateys.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.857
My new map
of hidden treasures

01:31.859 --> 01:34.626
is even more awesome
than awesome.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.428
There's the Crystal Cat.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.431
That's cool.
But been there. Done that.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.801
Well, over here
is the Ruby Red Ruby.

01:42.803 --> 01:48.474
Shiny. But we already
found it and it's safely
stored in our treasure room.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.842
How about...

01:49.844 --> 01:51.944
...the Golden Dinghy.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.645
[both] Golden Dinghy?

01:53.647 --> 01:57.883
A solid gold rowboat? That's a
treasure we've never found.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.652
Crew, that sounds
like a challenge.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.289
Mateys, will you go help us
find the Golden Dinghy?

02:05.825 --> 02:06.825
Great.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.027
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.430
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:11.432 --> 02:13.565
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

02:13.567 --> 02:15.834
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.803
Is everybody ready?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.204
I got my sword.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.839
I got my map.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.041
And I've got
my Pixie Dust.

02:23.043 --> 02:26.578
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.680
But only in emergencies.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.883
Yo-ho, let's go!

02:34.154 --> 02:37.122
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

02:37.124 --> 02:39.791
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

02:39.793 --> 02:40.959
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

02:40.961 --> 02:44.129
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

02:44.131 --> 02:46.999
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

02:47.001 --> 02:49.134
<i>¶ And me </i>

02:51.871 --> 02:53.572
[Cubby] Follow me, mateys.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.475
The trail to the
Golden Dinghy is this way.

02:56.477 --> 03:00.546
My map says we just follow this
trail over Pipe-Organ Plain...

03:00.548 --> 03:02.014
- [pipe organ blows]
- ...through Monkey Jungle...

03:02.016 --> 03:03.782
- [monkeys chittering]
- ...to Thumbs-Up Rock,

03:03.784 --> 03:06.051
where we'll find
the Golden Dinghy.

03:06.053 --> 03:10.989
Imagine, a whole dinghy
made of solid gold!

03:10.991 --> 03:12.658
Did you hear that?

03:12.660 --> 03:16.195
The puny pirates are following
that blasted map once again

03:16.197 --> 03:18.964
to a golden treasure.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.067
Too bad you don't have
a map like Cubby there, Cap'n.

03:22.069 --> 03:26.905
Bones, be quiet,
you are... a genius.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.441
- I am?
- [both] He is?

03:29.443 --> 03:31.710
Sharky. Got your quill pen?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.612
Never leave me bunk without it.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.615
I take it you've
seen Cubby's map?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.917
Aye, Captain,
'tis a beauty.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.953
Excellent.

03:40.955 --> 03:44.690
I want you to draw a map
exactly like it.

03:44.692 --> 03:50.262
With a few small changes
to trick those puny pirates.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.199
Follow me, mateys.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.834
Follow me, lads.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.002
- Oof!
- Whoa.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.705
[kids] Captain Hook?

03:59.707 --> 04:03.442
Oh, a thousand pardons,
puny pirates.

04:03.444 --> 04:07.613
I really must learn
to watch where I'm going.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.549
Cubby... your map.

04:10.551 --> 04:13.619
Um, thanks. No harm done.

04:13.621 --> 04:17.022
We're off on a treasure hunt,
Captain Hook, wanna join us?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.157
Thank you, but no.

04:19.159 --> 04:22.861
Meself and me crew are off on
our own little treasure hunt.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.096
Ta-ta for now.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.098
- Farewell.
- Anchors away, mateys.

04:26.100 --> 04:31.136
Did Captain Hook seem, I don't
know, nicer than usual?

04:31.138 --> 04:32.938
Sure did.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.539
I don't trust him.

04:34.541 --> 04:38.644
Relax, crew. He's gone and
we have treasure to find.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.846
Cubby, lead on.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.918
Come on, mateys. My map says
we should pass by Cuckoo Rock.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.987
[clock] Cuckoo, cuckoo.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.089
Um... uh...

04:51.091 --> 04:55.093
- We should go this way...
- [clock] Cuckoo, cuckoo.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.762
[all] Cuckoo Rock?

04:56.764 --> 04:58.964
- Again?
- We've been here before.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.733
I think we're going
around in circles.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.069
But we've been following
your map, Cubby.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.004
You always know where to go.

05:06.006 --> 05:10.108
All I know right now is...
we're lost.

05:10.110 --> 05:13.879
According to me freshly
pilfered map,

05:13.881 --> 05:16.515
we should be nearing...
Ahh!

05:16.517 --> 05:18.950
Pipe-Organ Plain.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.986
- [rocks play calliope music]
- Steam from Belch Mountain

05:20.988 --> 05:23.789
pumps these huge pillars
up and down.

05:23.791 --> 05:28.794
This blasted map offers no
instructions how to get across.

05:28.796 --> 05:33.198
[chuckles] I'll wager
the sea pups would figure
out a way to do it.

05:33.200 --> 05:38.870
I know. I'll simply "find the
beat" and time our safe passage.

05:38.872 --> 05:42.841
A-one, a-two, a-three, a...

05:42.843 --> 05:46.712
Oh, never mind.
Run! Run!

05:46.714 --> 05:49.014
[all shouting]

05:51.050 --> 05:52.951
[all screaming]

05:54.754 --> 05:57.522
- My map says it's this way.
- [clock] Cuckoo, cuckoo.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.159
Aw, triple-coconuts.
We're still lost.

06:01.161 --> 06:04.529
But I might be able to
figure out where we are

06:04.531 --> 06:08.433
if I could just get up
high and look around.

06:08.435 --> 06:12.204
We could look around from up
on top of Cuckoo Clock Rock.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.641
Look! Over there!

06:16.643 --> 06:20.078
It's Skull Rock!
I know that's on my map!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.948
It's right over...
Huh?

06:22.950 --> 06:26.818
- [all] Hook Rock?
- Something's wrong
with this map.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.453
I think it's a fake.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.088
One guess who made it.

06:30.090 --> 06:34.926
Hook. I bet he switched maps
when he bumped into Cubby on the
trail.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.828
We've got to get it back.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.899
But how can we find Hook
when we're lost ourselves?

06:40.901 --> 06:44.536
Hmm. I remember two landmarks
on my own map.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.906
We were going to pass them
on the way to the Golden Dinghy.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.643
This is Never Land.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.913
Now the first landmark
I remember was Pipe-Organ Plain,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.848
a musical note on the map.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.752
The second picture
on my map was a banana...

07:00.754 --> 07:02.220
...and that's Monkey Jungle.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.623
Hook's gotta pass
both these places

07:04.625 --> 07:07.926
on his way to Thumbs-Up Rock,
where the treasure is.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.463
Cubby, you're so good with maps
you can even draw your own

07:11.465 --> 07:13.865
and still get us to
where we want to go.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.001
Aw, it's nothin'.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.005
This way, men!

07:20.007 --> 07:23.542
I can practically smell
that Golden Dinghy!

07:23.544 --> 07:26.144
[sniffing] I smell monkeys.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.046
[chittering]

07:28.048 --> 07:29.881
- Oh, me, oh my!
- Blow me down!

07:29.883 --> 07:31.750
Thieves!

07:31.752 --> 07:34.820
Unhand that map,
you furry felons.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.856
That sounds like Monkey Jungle!

07:37.858 --> 07:41.159
[Hook] Get that stuff back,
especially that map!

07:41.161 --> 07:44.863
And that sounds like the monkeys
took Cubby's map!

07:44.865 --> 07:47.866
Come on, let's climb this tree
and check it out.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.469
[Hook] Get that map!

07:50.471 --> 07:53.572
- [monkeys chittering playfully]
- Give us back our pirate stuff,
monkey.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.007
Blast you!

07:56.009 --> 07:58.443
[chuckles] Funny monkeys.

07:58.445 --> 08:01.179
I think they're just... playin'.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.982
- Hey, Monkey!
- [chittering]

08:03.984 --> 08:06.952
- Heads up!
- [thankful chitter]

08:06.954 --> 08:10.722
You're welcome.
Hey, other monkey.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.225
Heads up.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.863
- Got it!
- No!

08:17.865 --> 08:20.599
Here's your map,
Captain Hook.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.870
But, I... was so close.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.707
Yeah, you were close,
for a sneaky-snook.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.943
We did it!
We got my map back!

08:31.945 --> 08:34.179
And we got three
gold doubloons.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.715
Let's grab 'em and go!

08:37.717 --> 08:39.784
So long, Captain Hook.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.487
How did they find me?

08:42.489 --> 08:46.892
I made sure this map sent them
round and round in circles.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.193
Wait one moment.

08:48.195 --> 08:51.429
Oh, that popinjay Cubby
is talented.

08:51.431 --> 08:54.599
He's shown me where
the treasure is.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.701
I'm still in this race!

08:58.838 --> 09:00.505
Here we are, mateys.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.108
My good ol' real map
says the treasure

09:03.110 --> 09:05.644
is over by Thumbs-Up Rock.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.547
- Out of me way, popinjays!
- [all] Huh?

09:08.549 --> 09:10.882
Ah-ha! Thumbs-Up Rock.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.919
I've found it!
I've found...

09:13.921 --> 09:16.688
...an ugly old brown wreck?

09:16.690 --> 09:20.926
Goodie. Maybe we can sail it
to find the Golden Dinghy.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.962
There is no Golden Dinghy.

09:23.964 --> 09:28.533
The puny pirates'
wonderful map is no good.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.803
Bah! Back to the
<i>Jolly Roger</i> we go.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.706
[sighs] Could Hook be right?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
Is my map... no good?

09:36.843 --> 09:39.611
It's awesome, Cubby.
Check it out.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.813
[Izzy and Cubby]
The Golden Dinghy!

09:41.815 --> 09:45.850
Yeah! It was just covered
with years of Never Land
dirt and grime.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.820
[chuckles] Hook beat us
to the Golden Dinghy

09:48.822 --> 09:50.889
and he didn't even know it.

09:50.891 --> 09:55.594
We found the hidden treasure
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.830
Let's grab 'em and
clean up this Golden Dinghy!

09:59.999 --> 10:03.201
- Beautiful.
- It's awesome!

10:03.203 --> 10:06.538
- [Hook and pirates shouting]
- Crackers!

10:06.540 --> 10:08.607
Help! Oh, help!

10:08.609 --> 10:11.076
The Never Falls, dead ahead!

10:11.078 --> 10:13.478
Sounds like an emergency.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.015
Hop aboard, mateys.
Pixie Dust away!

10:17.017 --> 10:20.018
[Hook] This is it, lads.
Hold your noses.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.287
[all shouting]

10:24.890 --> 10:27.993
[Izzy] Yay-hey. We saved
Hook and his crew

10:27.995 --> 10:30.895
and we got three more
gold doubloons!

10:30.897 --> 10:33.498
Let's grab 'em and go.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.935
I'm... I'm alive!

10:36.937 --> 10:40.639
And riding in...
a Golden Dinghy?

10:40.641 --> 10:42.140
That's right, Captain Hook.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.143
Cubby's awesome map
led us right to it.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.746
[Hook] Thundering blunderbuss!

10:49.915 --> 10:52.984
Thanks for helping us find
the Golden Dinghy, mateys,

10:52.986 --> 10:55.487
and for helping
get back Cubby's map.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.055
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:57.057 --> 10:59.024
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.767
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:08.769 --> 11:10.769
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:10.771 --> 11:12.737
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:12.739 --> 11:15.707
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:15.709 --> 11:17.942
Come on, count with us.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.612
[all] Yeah!

11:20.614 --> 11:24.015
[Cubby] One, two, three...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.484
[Jake] Four, five, six...

11:26.486 --> 11:28.853
[Izzy] Seven, eight, nine!

11:28.855 --> 11:32.023
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.826
we got nine
gold doubloons!

11:35.494 --> 11:37.629
And I got my map back.

11:37.631 --> 11:38.997
But that's not all.

11:38.999 --> 11:42.901
We also brought back
a boatload of bananas.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.136
- Let's eat.
- [chitters]

11:45.138 --> 11:46.938
What do you know?

11:46.940 --> 11:50.508
Where there's bananas,
there's monkeys.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.178
- [both laughing]
- [cheers]

11:55.948 --> 11:57.916
Um, Captain Hook, sir,

11:57.918 --> 12:00.618
are you sure we're
heading the right way?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.687
We've been sailing for hours.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.889
Of course I'm sure, Smee.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.925
I'm using me very own map.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.428
[sighs] That's what
I'm afraid of, sir,

12:10.430 --> 12:12.864
that's what I'm afraid of.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.037
[Jake] "Jake's Cool New Matey."

12:19.039 --> 12:22.107
Crackers and cheese!
Look alive, me hearties.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.909
It's a penguin!

12:24.911 --> 12:27.979
Wow! He must be
a long way from home.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.548
Then let's give him
a warm welcome.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.951
Ahoy, Mr. Penguin!

12:32.953 --> 12:34.986
Welcome to Pirate Island.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.489
Ahoy to you, too.
My name's Percy.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.958
But my friends call me Percy.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.826
Nice to meet you, Percy.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.161
Thank goodness
I made it to land.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.963
I thought my ice raft
was going to melt.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.998
Whoo. Is it always
so hot here?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.502
Warm and toasty,
just the way we like it.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.570
You wouldn't say that
if you were a penguin.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.572
It can't be too cold
if you ask me.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.041
So what brings
you here, Percy?

12:57.043 --> 13:00.078
My ice raft.
Seriously though, you see,

13:00.080 --> 13:03.081
I'm looking for a new home
for all my friends
in our penguin colony.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.851
The last place we lived in
broke into pieces and
it's all floating away.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.754
So now I'm looking for this
little slice of Never Land.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.855
According to penguin legend,

13:10.857 --> 13:13.525
there's a paradise
of ice and snow

13:13.527 --> 13:15.193
where it's winter
all year long.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.195
It's called
Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.864
I've never heard
of Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.733
It's not even on my map.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.702
It's not on any map,
so I have to find it myself.

13:24.704 --> 13:25.837
We'll help you find it.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.039
We're always ready
to help a new matey.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.910
Mateys, want to help Percy find
a new home for the penguins?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.712
Great!

13:34.714 --> 13:36.781
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.883
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

13:38.885 --> 13:40.985
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

13:40.987 --> 13:43.121
and put 'em in our Team
Treasure Chest.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.557
Yo-ho, let's go!

13:48.694 --> 13:51.596
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

13:51.598 --> 13:54.199
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:54.201 --> 13:55.567
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

13:55.569 --> 13:58.770
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:58.772 --> 14:01.739
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:01.741 --> 14:03.608
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:06.212 --> 14:08.813
Just watch yourselves
with it. Careful.

14:08.815 --> 14:12.116
OK. Careful.
Easy as you go.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.618
What's under here?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.520
I'll show you, but sh!

14:15.522 --> 14:16.921
[whispers] It's a secret.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.556
Keep it under your bandanas.

14:20.626 --> 14:21.759
- Awesome!
- Whoa!

14:21.761 --> 14:23.862
- Wow!
- Look, but don't touch, guys.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.631
This statue is very
special to my fellow penguins.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.666
Our new home wouldn't
be a home without it.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.035
A treasure indeed!

14:31.037 --> 14:34.606
Why yes, Cap'n.
Penguins are fascinating.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.474
Did you know that they
can make...

14:36.476 --> 14:39.744
I don't give a hoot
about penguins, Smee.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.613
I want that statue!

14:41.615 --> 14:44.115
Now, go fetch Sharky and Bones.

14:44.117 --> 14:48.887
It's time to watch the little
birdie and see where he goes.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.622
Aw, coconuts.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.458
If Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon
isn't on my map,

14:53.460 --> 14:55.026
how are we gonna find it?

14:55.028 --> 14:58.529
We'll have to look
somewhere where it's cold.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.966
But there aren't many places
like that on Never Land.

15:01.968 --> 15:04.435
What about Never Peak Mountain?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.070
It's always cold there.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.707
Yeah, but I don't think there
are any canyons up there.

15:09.709 --> 15:14.112
Maybe the canyon's
on the other side of the
mountain in its shade.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.114
Shade? Did you say shade?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.683
That sounds cooler.
Let's get waddling.

15:22.154 --> 15:25.890
Hoo! The heat. I'm about
to have a penguin meltdown.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.726
Speaking of penguins,
check it out!

15:28.728 --> 15:31.496
[Percy] Frozen tundra!
More penguins!

15:31.498 --> 15:36.034
Don't just stand there,
act like penguins.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.169
[both] Waddle-waddle-waddle.
Waddle-waddle.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.505
Waddle-waddle-waddle-waddle.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.473
What's with those penguins?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.575
Oh! Maybe they're
from my colony.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.445
Hey, fellas!
It's me. Percy.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.080
How did you guys
get here so fast?

15:49.082 --> 15:52.083
Were you chased by like
a polar bear or something?

15:52.085 --> 15:56.454
Our waddle's workin'.
He thinks we're penguins.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.089
[both grunt]

15:58.091 --> 16:01.492
Sorry, Cap'n. I wiggled
when I should've waddled.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
Percy, stop! It's a trap!

16:03.496 --> 16:05.496
That's Sharkey and Bones!

16:08.434 --> 16:10.535
Me plan worked!

16:10.537 --> 16:13.638
Now, watch what happens
when those puny pirates

16:13.640 --> 16:16.774
try to free their
puny penguin pal.

16:16.776 --> 16:20.778
Once they're all bogged down,
we'll get that statue.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.614
Hang on, Percy.
We'll get you out.

16:23.616 --> 16:27.185
But how can we get Percy out
without us getting stuck?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.754
How 'bout using
this old fence?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.123
We could put some of
the loose boards on the mud

16:32.125 --> 16:35.093
and then Percy could
walk on them like a bridge.

16:37.129 --> 16:40.164
You young pirates are
sharper than a walrus' tusk.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.432
Thanks for helpin'.

16:41.434 --> 16:46.804
We helped Percy out of the mud
and we got three gold doubloons!

16:46.806 --> 16:50.708
Let's grab 'em and keep looking
for Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.578
Oh, those sea pups

16:53.580 --> 16:55.046
are so clever.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.748
You gotta give 'em that.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.650
Bah. I'll give them
nothing but grief.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.587
Follow me. We must set
another trap

17:02.589 --> 17:06.224
so I can get me hook
on that statue.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.725
[both] Waddle-waddle.
Waddle-waddle.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.261
You can stop waddling now.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.466
[Jake] So we always have to
watch out for Captain Hook.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.602
He sounds like
a snarky ol' shark,

17:17.604 --> 17:19.137
but he'll never stop me.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.706
Whoo! This heat might though.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.842
- [gasps]
- Sno-cones! Sno-cones!

17:24.844 --> 17:28.212
Get your ice cold sno-cones!

17:28.214 --> 17:30.548
[slurps] Snow-way!

17:30.550 --> 17:33.851
Percy, stop!
It's another trap!

17:33.853 --> 17:36.687
I love sno-cones!
[slurps]

17:36.689 --> 17:39.924
So cool. So good.
So... huh?

17:39.926 --> 17:42.493
Not "snow" fast, penguin.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.995
[gasps] The statue!

17:43.997 --> 17:48.533
Frostbites! We gotta save my
statue. This is an emergency.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.902
Pixie Dust away!

17:56.442 --> 17:58.543
Yo-ho, way to go!

17:58.545 --> 18:03.514
We saved Percy's statue and we
got three more gold doubloons!

18:03.516 --> 18:06.918
Let's grab 'em and go
find Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.189
This is it, Percy.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.891
The other side
of Never Peak Mountain.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.662
[shivers] It's really cold here.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.497
Ahh. Great, isn't it?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.732
Nice and cold.
I'm lovin' it.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.001
And that's not all
I'm lovin'. Look!

18:24.003 --> 18:26.437
Chi-Chi-Chilly Canyon, ho!

18:26.439 --> 18:28.906
It's paradise! Whoo-hoo!

18:30.075 --> 18:31.709
I feel at home already.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.511
Now you can go
back to your colony

18:33.513 --> 18:35.613
and tell all
the other penguins.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.648
I can let them know
right from here.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.818
- [Jake] Yo-ho-ho!
- [Cubby] Wow!

18:40.820 --> 18:43.554
- [Izzy] Amazing!
- [Percy] Yep, you're not wrong.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.723
It's not only pretty,
it's a signal.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.525
When my fellow penguins
see the lights,

18:47.527 --> 18:50.528
they'll follow them
here to our new home.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.731
- Incoming!
- Welcome home, Mr. Penguin.

18:53.733 --> 18:58.536
Now, turn over the statue,
pretty lights and all.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.738
Yay-hey, no-way.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.206
What she said.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.443
This statue belongs to my
colony. I'll never give it up.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.711
You heard the bird, Hook.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.881
The only thing you're leaving
here with is cold feet.

19:09.883 --> 19:12.049
Defiant to the end, eh?

19:12.051 --> 19:14.886
Then it's snowballs for you.

19:16.555 --> 19:18.589
You know what this means,
mateys.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.659
Yo-ho, snowballs go!

19:22.127 --> 19:24.595
Why, of all the insolence!

19:24.597 --> 19:26.030
Don't just stand there, men.

19:26.032 --> 19:29.100
Protect me,
your beloved Captain!

19:29.102 --> 19:31.502
Aye-aye, Cap'n.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.603
[sneezes]

19:33.972 --> 19:35.072
Whoo-hoo!

19:35.074 --> 19:37.008
Ahh, ahh, ahh!

19:37.010 --> 19:39.210
Hoo! Hey! Ooh!

19:42.714 --> 19:46.784
On your feet, men!
Surround the scurvy swabs!

19:48.053 --> 19:50.788
[laughs] This is fun.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.457
Not at me. At them!

19:53.459 --> 19:57.962
Coconuts. I don't know how
much longer we can hold out.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.731
Maybe we won't have to.
Look!

20:01.633 --> 20:02.867
What?

20:02.869 --> 20:06.470
Who in blazes
threw that snow... ball?

20:06.472 --> 20:10.107
[chuckle] Hello.

20:10.109 --> 20:13.711
You know you all make me
feel so under-dressed.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.482
My colony! They found us!

20:18.484 --> 20:23.588
[stammering] Save me!
I'm freezing!

20:23.590 --> 20:27.558
We'll have you back home
and warm in no time, sir.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.596
Bye-bye, penguins.
Welcome to your new home.

20:32.831 --> 20:36.867
Icy icebergs!
Our statue is saved!

20:36.869 --> 20:39.003
Yo-ho, way to go!

20:39.005 --> 20:43.541
The Penguins have their new home
and we got four more gold
doubloons!

20:43.543 --> 20:47.578
Let's grab 'em and go have a
housewarming party in the cold!

20:52.484 --> 20:54.518
<i>¶ Penguins never</i>

20:54.520 --> 20:56.487

21:35.862 --> 21:38.929
Because of all of you,
my colony has a new home.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.631
I can never
thank you enough.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.168
We're just glad to have
so many cool new mateys.

21:46.438 --> 21:49.874
Thanks for helping us find
a new home for the penguins,
mateys.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.076
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:52.078 --> 21:54.612
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.888
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>

gold doubloons.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.018
And I brought back sno-cones!

22:34.020 --> 22:37.154
Percy made them
especially for us.

22:37.156 --> 22:41.092
Quick. Let's eat 'em
before they turn
into sno-cone soup.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.931
[sneezes]

22:46.933 --> 22:52.002
Blast all puny pirates
and pesky penguins.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.672
I may never defrost.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.673

<i>¶ Stays away </i>

23:40.219 --> 23:44.288

is a stale cracker!
