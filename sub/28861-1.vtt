Well, come on, it's your

02:33.921 --> 02:36.088
- I'm not
sure it was in focus,

02:36.089 --> 02:38.256
how about you do it again but
this time, lose the shirts.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.359
- Later honey, for
your eyes only.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.836
- What these girls
do to me is criminal.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.777
You seeing this shit?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.279
- Unfortunately.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.780
- Jesus Riker, lighten
up, it's a fucking party,

03:01.782 --> 03:03.782

03:03.783 --> 03:05.783
- Problem, let's see, I'm
broke as fuck, I hate everyone

03:05.786 --> 03:07.920
including myself and
I'm an angry drunk.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.658
- Hey,
got you a present.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.799
- Thanks babe.

03:22.870 --> 03:23.936
I'm getting sleepy.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.972
Don't you think it's
time for us to go to bed?

03:28.275 --> 03:30.409
- Oof yes.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.444
- Enjoying the show?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.249
So are they an item?

04:10.251 --> 04:11.917
Ya know, like officially?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.319
- Yeah, for the past six months.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.021
- Is there any
wiggle room there?

04:16.023 --> 04:17.656
- Why?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.024
- I'm just curious.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.360
- Not that I know of.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.663
- So how
do you know Caleb?

04:24.665 --> 04:26.331
- Grade school.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.733
- You guys close?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.434
- Wouldn't go as far as that.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.736
- Oh come on,
gimme more than that,

04:30.738 --> 04:31.797
what's the deal?

04:32.539 --> 04:33.905
- There's no deal.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.574
He's just kind of an ass-hat.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.309
- This is his camera.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.344
You know he's gonna
see this shit, right?

04:39.346 --> 04:41.546
- He knows that he's
a fucking ass-hat.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.382
- Then why
are you friends?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.201
- Habit.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.019
- Well, I like him,
plus he's got a nice ass.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.621
- Yes, one mustn't neglect
the little things in life.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.023
- This
guy bothering you?

04:51.025 --> 04:53.659
- Jesus Caleb, that was fast.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.596
- What happened to
little miss drunky-no-pants?

04:57.598 --> 05:00.365
- Head hit the pillow,
she zonked the fuck out.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.401
Looks like I'm
flying solo tonight.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.669
- That's disappointing,
I would have thought

05:03.671 --> 05:05.337
you woulda went for it anyway.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.439
It's kinda your style.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.776
- Don't be a dick.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.053
- You're a fucking
piece of shit Caleb.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.478
- Hey, wake
up sleepy tits.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.748
Come on babe, it's almost three.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.049
- God damn it, really?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.017
- Yeah, and
we're out of food.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.388
- Then go to
the fucking grocery.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.773
- Come on,
we're out of money too.

06:30.774 --> 06:32.157
- That's
your department.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.025
I'm just supposed
to look pretty.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.394
- I'll have
cash on Tuesday.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.062
We'll put it on the card.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.899
How you feeling?

06:42.136 --> 06:44.703
- Like I got run over
by a fucking truck.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.542
Did I make out with
Cara last night?

06:50.544 --> 06:51.543
- Affirmative.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.612
- Fuck!

06:53.614 --> 06:55.113
She still here?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.915
- No, I think she
snuck out this morning.

06:59.887 --> 07:00.719
- Good.

07:00.720 --> 07:01.920
Did you enjoy the show at least?

07:02.489 --> 07:04.723
- Give it three stars.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.764
- How 'bout now?

07:06.894 --> 07:09.461
- Three and
a half.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.031
You know this is going all
over the internet, right?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.800
- Don't
joke about that.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.436
- Not joking,
how could I deprive

07:17.438 --> 07:18.670
the world of those?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.707
- You really like the idea
of other guys looking at me?

07:22.709 --> 07:24.109
- Only with
your permission.

07:24.111 --> 07:24.943
- Mmmhmm.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.178
- What'dya say?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.712
Do you hearby grant

07:27.714 --> 07:29.648
the right in perpetuity
throughout the world

07:29.650 --> 07:31.817
and all media now
or hereafter known.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.084
- Stop it.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.553
- No no, this
needs to be official.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.221
The right to use images
of my supremely hot bod

07:36.223 --> 07:39.558
and super duper sexy
voice, so help me god?

07:40.994 --> 07:42.461
- Maybe.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.862
- Sorry, but I'm
gonna need a yes or no.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.630
Think of it like
a trust exercise.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.468
- Whatever you want, dear.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.569
- So that's a yes?

07:51.505 --> 07:52.771
- Sure.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.972
- You fucking slut.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.873
- Shut up!

07:57.945 --> 07:59.211
Do you still respect me?

07:59.213 --> 08:02.581
- I'm gonna go with yes.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.082
- Good.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.552
Then put down the camera
and get me some breakfast.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.762
- Well hello there internet,
I didn't see you come in.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.099
Have you met my lovely,
wonderful insanely

08:21.101 --> 08:22.834
fuckable girl friend, Abby?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.236
She doesn't visit my
channel very often,

08:24.238 --> 08:25.670
but when she does, woo!

08:25.672 --> 08:28.273
It's like fireworks if
you know what I mean.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.174
Ah shit.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.577
- Which one?

08:32.578 --> 08:33.845
- I thought we were
just getting essentials.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.946
- We are.

08:34.948 --> 08:35.847
- Both.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.986
- That Cara?

08:41.988 --> 08:43.988
- No it's Riker, he says sorry
for being a raging douche.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.057
And he wants us to come
out to Blackwood tonight.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.526
- S'mores in the forest?

08:47.528 --> 08:49.528
- Something strong, he
says the shit came in.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.664
- Oh, I'm still getting
stuff for s'mores.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.242
- Look, I'm not giving you
shit, I just wanna know

09:04.244 --> 09:06.878
if you got to bludgeon
the flaps a little bit.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.647
- You are beyond disgusting.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.115
- Oh what, come on!

09:10.117 --> 09:11.650
You get to hear every
detail about my sex life.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.784
- Hey!
- Yeah, because you won't

09:12.786 --> 09:14.586
fucking shut up about it.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.923
- All right listen, I'm
with Caleb on this one.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.125
- What?
- Bros before hoes.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.344
Know what I'm saying.

09:22.345 --> 09:24.562
- Damn, you just
set the women's lib movement

09:24.565 --> 09:25.697
back maybe 60 years.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.032
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.133
Women's lib?

09:28.135 --> 09:30.101
Excuse me, is this 1968?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.203
Are you an English professor
at fucking Dartmouth?

09:32.205 --> 09:33.672
- You know what?

09:33.674 --> 09:35.374
You guys want equal rights?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.075
You get to carry the 50 pounds
of shit you made me bring.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.678
- Uh, which I paid for.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.580
- Until Tuesday.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.815
- Look pussies,
it's not that heavy,

09:43.817 --> 09:45.150
and it's not that fucking far.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.084
- What are you talking about?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.619
- It's just over the hill

09:47.621 --> 09:49.754
- Yeah, like a mile and a half.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.957
- Unless we cut across
the railroad tracks.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.091
- What, through Shanty Town?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.626
- Yeah.
- What babe, ya scared?

09:54.628 --> 09:55.961
- Of homeless people?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.363
They're terrifying.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.931
- What?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.166
Oh my god.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.133
- You never
had a weird experience

10:02.135 --> 10:03.602
with a homeless dude?

10:03.604 --> 10:04.787
- No, they
ask me for change,

10:04.788 --> 10:05.971
I tell 'em no and leave.
- No seriously?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.072
- Exactly.
- They're all fucking crazy.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.006
- Oh come on!
- They're not all crazy.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.874
- It's terrifying.

10:09.876 --> 10:10.842
- Let's go.
- All right Riker

10:10.844 --> 10:12.344
lead the way.
- All right.

10:12.346 --> 10:14.179
- You know what they
say, early bird gets the worm,

10:14.180 --> 10:16.013
second bird doesn't get
stabbed by a homeless dude.

10:17.684 --> 10:18.850
Come on, let's see it.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.220
- All right Jesus, hold
your fucking horses.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.356
Tah dah.

10:24.358 --> 10:25.790
- So beautiful.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.659
- Now, before we get into this,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.361
- Awww.
- Ohhh.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.229
- Look, I'm trying
to make a point here.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.065
I wanna say I'm sorry for
being an angry uberfucking

10:34.067 --> 10:35.900
drunk douche at the party.

10:35.902 --> 10:38.770
And I care about you guys
and value your friendship

10:38.772 --> 10:41.973
and love you all and some
emotional shit like that.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.241
- Awww.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.743
- So sweet,
open the fucking bag.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.177
- How much of that are
we supposed to smoke?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.980
- Like two, three puffs, tops.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.281
- I ain't no fucking
bitch, Riker.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.850
- I know you ain't
no fucking bitch.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.019
- Yeah, don't skimp
on it, I don't wanna repeat

10:54.021 --> 10:55.253
of the mushroom debacle.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.288
- Oh this is way
stronger, trust me.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.290
- How the
fuck do you know?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.693
- Came out here a couple
days ago and I tried it.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.261
Trust me, three puffs
is all you fucking need.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.829
- Wait a
second, wait a second,

11:04.831 --> 11:07.832
you're saying you came
out here all by yourself

11:07.834 --> 11:11.002
to try something brand new,
on your own, without me.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.738
- Yep.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.774
- Awww, Riker,
- Bastard.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.409
- I thought tonight was
gonna be the first time

11:17.411 --> 11:18.843
for both of us.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.680
But you had to go
and pop your cherry.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.747
- I just had to make
sure it was safe

11:22.749 --> 11:25.150
for the mere mortal
in our presence.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.052
Your turn.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.394
- Shit,
slow down, won't ya?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.229
- Pipe down, you'll
get your fucking turn.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.133
- Oh not a good
flavor, gotta be honest.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.034
- You've sucked worse.

11:43.036 --> 11:43.902
- Yeah ya have.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.871
Yes, chasers are
definitely a must.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.107
- All right,
go ahead and spike it.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.075
- All right, if you say so.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.210
- What is that shit?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.747
- A hallucinogenic herb of
the something fucking plant.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.916
I don't know, Indians used
to smoke it to see God

11:57.918 --> 12:00.285
or the devil or purple
trees or some shit.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.720
- It's Native
Americans you prick.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.822
- Yeah purple
tries do exist.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.492
- Well, tonight, this
is our peace pipe.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.060
Come on, you're turn.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.862
- All right, all right.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.236
- Here we
go, baby's first hit.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.106
- Asshole.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.647
- See?

12:28.648 --> 12:30.849
- Yeah you're gonna
wanna take a drink.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.285
Here's to one fucked
up night in the woods.

12:34.287 --> 12:39.357
- Woo!

13:04.985 --> 13:06.217
- Did you see it?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.285
Can you see?

14:02.342 --> 14:03.241
- Abby?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.589
Everything okay?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.058
- Yeah, why?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.461
- You and Riker were
having a pretty serious

15:30.463 --> 15:31.396
talk back there.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.967
- He's just having
some problems at home.

15:46.012 --> 15:47.479
- How would
you like to be married

15:47.480 --> 15:48.947
to a dame like,

15:48.949 --> 15:49.647
- Really?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.490
- I'm turning it off.

17:35.188 --> 17:39.323
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey shh, shh, calm down.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.092
It's all right, it was a dream.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.693
It was just a dream, okay?

17:44.197 --> 17:44.829
It's all right.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.832
It's all right, it's all right.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.667
Just breathe.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.568
Shhhh.

17:56.142 --> 17:56.808
Okay.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.544
- I'm telling
you, this was different.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.812
- Different how?

18:00.814 --> 18:03.081
- Can you just trust me?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.682
- Like every other time to me.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.551
- It was different,
where the hell are the keys?

18:06.553 --> 18:08.119
- How was it different?

18:08.121 --> 18:09.587
- Caleb you're
gonna make me late.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.489
- Did you check on
top of the fridge?

18:14.360 --> 18:15.359
- Thank you.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.261
- Different how?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.099
- You know the shadow
guy at the foot of the bed?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.133
He wasn't in this one.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.835
I wasn't even at home.

18:23.837 --> 18:27.105
I was back in the woods and
there was something with me.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.173
- What did it look like?

18:29.175 --> 18:31.109
- I don't remember.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.111
- What were you and
Riker talking about?

18:33.113 --> 18:34.245
- Jesus, Caleb, now?

18:45.425 --> 18:48.526
Look, I don't even remember
what he was saying.

18:48.528 --> 18:52.163
I think he was still drunk
or tripping or something.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.398
Something about his
mom being depressed

18:54.400 --> 18:56.501
and his sister is
freaking out again.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.537
You know, typical Riker
soap opera bullshit.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.309
I'm sorry I made you jealous.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.377
- It happens.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.213
- Say you're okay.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.314
- I'm okay.

19:10.316 --> 19:14.185
- Good, your insecurities
are making me late.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.554
I will call if rehearsal
lets out early.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.566
- Looks like
someone can't handle his

19:28.568 --> 19:30.701
hard core hallucinogens.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.937
It's just you and me now babe.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.273
- How scandalous.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.775
- So you wanna
ditch this loser or what?

19:37.777 --> 19:41.479
- Mom always told me avoid
randy men with video cameras.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.247
- You
really are gorgeous.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.483
- Thanks.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.319
Put the camera down now.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.226
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to upset you.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.628
- You didn't upset me.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.831
I'm used to all
kinds of compliments.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.936
Fuckable, hot, gorgeous
is just a new one.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.737
You caught me off guard is all.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.441
You think he's really out?

20:10.443 --> 20:11.809
- God, I hope so.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.644
- Don't be a dick.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.413
- Sorry, it's just
that being around him

20:15.415 --> 20:16.447
all the time can get really--

20:16.449 --> 20:17.582
- Exhausting?

20:17.584 --> 20:18.482
- Yes.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.357
I love you.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.327
- What?

20:29.329 --> 20:30.228
- I love you.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.732
- Is that the drugs talking?

20:34.734 --> 20:38.302
- Yeah.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.837
Wanna go for a walk?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.005
- Promise to be a gentleman?

20:41.007 --> 20:42.373
- I don't even
know what the fuck

20:42.375 --> 20:43.641
that means anymore.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.330
- What do you want?

21:06.332 --> 21:07.865
- We need to talk about Abby.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.434
- Gimme a minute.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.944
- She hasn't slept much.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.445
She'll wake up screaming.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.048
I thought it was just
like an attention thing.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.283
You know how Abby is.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.484
- Don't say that.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.387
- Sorry, just don't
really know what to do.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.726
- Fuck man, what do
you want from me?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.845
You and Abby disappear
off the face of the earth

21:37.846 --> 21:39.963
for a fucking month, she won't
respond to any of my texts.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.899
- She thinks you had
something to do with it.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.000
- Do with what?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.435
- The dream.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.437
- What dream?

21:48.074 --> 21:49.407
- Just go talk to her.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.743
Tell her to go see
someone, maybe it'll help.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.680
- Yeah, okay.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.895
- You're not gonna say anything?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.068
- Why did you bring him here?

22:20.073 --> 22:21.439
- Great point.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.947
She's being a complete cunt.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.116
- She doesn't have
a good reason?

22:32.118 --> 22:36.487
147 text messages,
does that ring a bell?

22:38.057 --> 22:41.058
Just go in there and listen
to what she has to say, okay?

22:42.695 --> 22:43.594
- Fine.

22:51.104 --> 22:54.372
- Tell 'im, come on.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.442
You told me a thousand
times already.

22:58.444 --> 23:02.146
Starts, you're alone
in the woods then,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.052
- I'm moving
forward down a path.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.958
There's a light, but I
can't see past the light.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.995
And there's a symbol that
keeps flashing in my head.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.798
It's a spiral with
a line through it.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.001
And I'm getting close
to something big.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.573
It's a shadow and I can't
quite make it out at first.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.576
But then I see it.

23:33.613 --> 23:37.848
It's about eight feet
tall and its skin is,

23:37.850 --> 23:40.017
- Red and black,
like rotted meat.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.856
- And its eyes are,

23:45.858 --> 23:46.757
- Red.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.463
Call me when you
really wanna talk.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.815
- Tell me what it is.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.983
- I'm not sure yet.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.186
Do you remember the
night in the woods?

24:15.188 --> 24:17.054
You saw something that night.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.489
- We were stoned.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.190
- What's your
fucking point, Abby?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.558
That it didn't happen?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.625
That it isn't happening?

24:22.929 --> 24:24.662
You have to face reality.

24:26.199 --> 24:28.933
- I can't
handle this on my own.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.000
I need your help.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.356
- All right fine.

24:35.357 --> 24:37.641
Look, do me a favor, don't tell
Caleb we talked, all right?

24:39.545 --> 24:40.244
- Okay.

25:10.543 --> 25:12.209
- You're going all
out tonight, huh?

25:13.246 --> 25:14.645
- Figured you were
tired of the sweatpants

25:14.647 --> 25:16.580
and T-shirt routine.

25:16.582 --> 25:19.116
Just wanted to
look nice for once.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.017
- Feel better?

25:24.156 --> 25:25.523
- Do you think I'm pretty?

25:26.826 --> 25:27.791
- You have to ask?

25:31.764 --> 25:34.532
You know, we don't
have to go out tonight,

25:34.534 --> 25:35.633
if you don't want to.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.702
There's plenty we
could do right here.

25:44.777 --> 25:45.660
- I'll tell you what.

25:45.661 --> 25:46.544
Why don't we pop open
that bottle of wine

25:46.546 --> 25:47.711
and see what happens.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.682
- Anything
you want, babe.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.985
Anything at all.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.492
- Abby, hey hey, hey
hey hey shh, shh,

28:48.494 --> 28:49.426
it's just a dream.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.995
It's just me, it's okay shhh.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.182
Shhh, shhh

28:55.183 --> 28:56.165
It was another dream, it's okay.

28:56.168 --> 28:59.169
Shhh.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.756
- Are you sure
it wasn't another dream?

29:20.326 --> 29:21.225
- No.

29:23.763 --> 29:24.795
- Tell me.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.380
- Tell you what, Riker?

29:26.381 --> 29:27.964
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.434
- Do you remember what
happened in the woods?

29:30.436 --> 29:33.203
- I told you we are not
gonna talk about that.

29:38.511 --> 29:39.710
- I missed you.

29:39.711 --> 29:40.910
I've missed both of you, I mean.

29:41.814 --> 29:43.781
I didn't mean for things
to happen like that.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.883
I just wanted to talk to you.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.318
Wasn't it nice being
able to actually talk

29:48.320 --> 29:49.386
without Caleb
interrupting every two--

29:49.388 --> 29:51.855
- You are unbelievable, Riker.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.225
- I take that as a compliment.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.539
- Is your dream
the same as mine?

30:11.143 --> 30:12.943
- I don't wanna answer that.
- Why?

30:12.945 --> 30:13.977
- I don't wanna scare you.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.179
- I'm already scared.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.446
- Me too.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.381
So what do we do?

30:18.951 --> 30:21.018
- I was about to ask
you the same thing.

30:25.357 --> 30:28.559
Do you ever think that by
obsessing over this thing

30:28.561 --> 30:30.360
we're just making things worse?

30:31.597 --> 30:33.063
- Worse how?

30:33.065 --> 30:35.165
- I don't know, fixating on it,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.434
thinking about it all the
time just makes it a bigger

30:37.436 --> 30:38.836
deal than it is.

30:38.838 --> 30:40.471
- It's already a pretty
big fucking deal.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.105
- I just mean that if
you talk about something

30:42.107 --> 30:44.474
all the time you give
it power over you.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.977
- So you're saying that if
we just don't talk about it.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.880
- Talk about, think,
debate, anything.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.415
- That it'll just go away?

30:53.419 --> 30:53.918
- Maybe.

30:53.919 --> 30:54.418
- That's a super healthy way

30:54.420 --> 30:55.385
to deal with your problems, Abs.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.054
- Do you have any better ideas?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.061
- I went back into the woods.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.396
- What?

31:06.398 --> 31:07.431
When?

31:07.433 --> 31:08.599
- Night before last.

31:08.601 --> 31:09.900
- What did you find?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.539
Riker.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.873
What did you find in the woods?

31:18.043 --> 31:19.076
- I don't remember.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.278
- What do you mean?

31:21.280 --> 31:23.313
- I went into the woods,
and I came back out

31:23.315 --> 31:25.382
covered in mud,
scared half to death.

31:25.384 --> 31:29.586
By the time I got home, I
couldn't remember anything.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.055
Like a bad dream.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.659
- So you don't
remember your dreams?

31:35.661 --> 31:36.593
- You know that I do.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.462
- Are they the same as mine?

31:38.464 --> 31:40.964
- They are, but one
thing's different.

31:40.966 --> 31:41.632
- Which is?

31:42.635 --> 31:44.434
- I'm the monster in the woods.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.179
- I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.247
- Answer
the question Riker,

32:30.249 --> 32:31.949
were you in our fucking house?

32:31.951 --> 32:33.250
- Caleb, you
need to calm down.

32:33.252 --> 32:34.318
- I'll calm
down when you answer

32:34.320 --> 32:36.019
my fucking questions.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.371
You're filling her head with
all this bullshit and now,

32:37.372 --> 32:38.722
- You know
what, fuck you Caleb.

32:38.724 --> 32:39.556
- I'm coming over.

32:39.558 --> 32:40.774
- Don't do that.

32:40.775 --> 32:41.991
- You won't come
clean, maybe Anna's gonna

32:41.994 --> 32:43.527
have some answers for me.

32:43.529 --> 32:44.461
- I told you don't
come to my fucking house,

32:44.463 --> 32:45.262
you complete fucking asshole!

32:45.264 --> 32:45.595
- I'm on my way.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.180
What do you mean?

33:03.182 --> 33:04.381
- I mean I don't
think it was Riker.

33:04.383 --> 33:05.983
Why would he do
something like that?

33:05.985 --> 33:07.417
- To freak you out.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.152
He's got some kind of
sick fascination with you.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.021
I think he'd do anything
for some attention.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.356
- That is not fair.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.757
He's never done anything
like this before.

33:13.759 --> 33:16.426
- He almost gave
me a fucking concussion.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.328
I cannot believe you're trying
to defend that little shit.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.129
- I'm not, I'm not!

33:19.131 --> 33:20.597
I'm just saying that,

33:20.599 --> 33:22.466
- What?
What are you saying?

33:23.335 --> 33:25.168
- He knew the dream, okay.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.170
He knew exactly
what it looked like.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.672
How could he have known?

33:28.674 --> 33:32.242
- Listen, Abby, that night
we were drinking and smoking

33:32.244 --> 33:34.244
god knows what, who knows
what he put in there?

33:34.246 --> 33:35.512
- What?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.781
- I'm just saying you don't know

33:37.783 --> 33:39.649
what he did to you that night.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.019
For all we know he could
have planted this whole thing

33:42.021 --> 33:43.637
in your head.

33:43.638 --> 33:45.254
- You think Riker
fucking inceptioned me?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.090
Are you fucking serious Caleb?

33:47.092 --> 33:48.258
- Why not?

33:48.260 --> 33:49.326
It's easier to
believe than some--

33:49.328 --> 33:51.061
- Than what?

33:51.063 --> 33:52.062
Hm? Than what?

33:52.064 --> 33:53.914
Say it.

33:53.915 --> 33:55.765
- Then some fucking monster
breaking into our house

33:55.768 --> 33:58.035
and drawing on the mirror
with your lipstick.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.504
- You think I'm crazy.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.139
- No, I don't Abby.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.140
- Or stupid.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.608
It's one or the other Caleb,

34:04.610 --> 34:06.109
so take your fucking pick.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.144
- No, come back.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.146
Fuck!

34:16.188 --> 34:17.621
Hi guys.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.922
I know my channel's usually
pretty light hearted,

34:19.924 --> 34:22.224
but I've had some pretty
intense shit going on recently.

34:23.362 --> 34:27.063
Kind of a long story, but
basically my girlfriend thinks

34:27.065 --> 34:29.266
that we're being
attacked by a monster.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.101
My best friend is
encouraging her

34:31.103 --> 34:33.837
and neither of them are
acting like themselves.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.139
Been kinda at a loss, so
I figured I'd ask you guys

34:36.141 --> 34:37.674
on the internet for help.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.710
Put all the details in
the description below.

34:40.712 --> 34:41.844
It's easier to write
everything down,

34:41.847 --> 34:43.746
that way I don't
forget anything.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.617
I feel like I'm going crazy.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.588
I know it's stupid, but
there's only so much

34:51.590 --> 34:54.123
of listening to people
say batshit things

34:54.126 --> 34:56.693
before they start to make
sense a little bit, ya know?

34:58.097 --> 35:00.730
I mean, Abby's always been a
bit of an attention seeker.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.134
She's done some pretty
annoying things before,

35:04.136 --> 35:06.136
but not like this.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.773
She's been downplaying it.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.375
She doesn't wanna
talk about anything.

35:12.377 --> 35:15.178
She acts scared all the time.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.413
Sometimes I just wanna
shake her until--

35:16.415 --> 35:17.814
- What are you doing?

35:17.816 --> 35:18.782
- Nothing babe.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.628
- So this
is where they start,

36:04.630 --> 36:05.562
no idea why.

36:10.235 --> 36:14.204
And they keep going around
the side of the house.

36:27.486 --> 36:30.253
On the other side of the gate.

36:34.326 --> 36:37.494
All the way to the back porch

36:39.765 --> 36:40.764
and they end there.

37:13.599 --> 37:14.731
- You feeling it yet?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.000
- What?

37:17.002 --> 37:19.402
- Yeah you are.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.806
- You
think I'm gorgeous.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.841
- Everyone thinks
you're gorgeous Abby.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.377
- Even Caleb?

37:27.379 --> 37:30.347
- Yes, even Caleb.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.248
- Yeah.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.751
Me and every other
girl in a short skirt.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.386
- It's his nature.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.355
- It's my nature to get fucked.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.357
- Could be worse,
my nature is to--

37:40.359 --> 37:40.991
- Brood.

37:42.527 --> 37:45.362
- No, my nature is to be crazy.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.363
It runs in my family.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.432
My dad was homeless
or in and out of jail

37:49.434 --> 37:50.934
for most of his life.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.035
The last thing he
ever said to me

37:52.037 --> 37:53.637
was don't let it get you.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.039
Words to fucking live by.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.875
- It always comes down to
daddy issues, doesn't it?

38:00.345 --> 38:02.612
Last time I talked
to my dad he told me

38:02.613 --> 38:04.880
I was a shameless slut and
kicked me out of the house.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.517
- I think that's supposed
to be called tough love.

38:07.519 --> 38:10.020
- It's the shameless
part that really gets me.

38:10.022 --> 38:11.688
I mean doesn't
everybody enjoy sex?

38:11.690 --> 38:14.391
- Sex is pretty fucking great.

38:14.393 --> 38:17.827
- But shameless means I'm
supposed to be sorry for it.

38:17.829 --> 38:21.331
Like it's my fault that
guys are shallow assholes.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.400
When Caleb does it, nobody
thinks anything of it.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.885
It's like,

38:24.886 --> 38:26.369
- Why don't you
ditch that douche?

38:26.371 --> 38:27.837
- And go where?

38:27.839 --> 38:28.938
With what money?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.577
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't,

38:34.579 --> 38:35.812
- Do you really mean it?

38:35.814 --> 38:37.714
- Yes, but I didn't
mean to upset you, I--

38:37.716 --> 38:38.615
- No.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.485
Do you really think
I should leave?

38:46.358 --> 38:47.424
- Did you hear that?

39:00.505 --> 39:02.339
- Riker stop.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.039
I'm scared.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.909
- It's all right Abby,
I'll be right back.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.077
I just need to find
out what it was.

39:07.079 --> 39:08.912
- No, don't go,
please, stay with me.

39:15.087 --> 39:15.985
I shouldn't.

39:15.987 --> 39:16.853
Riker.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.789
Riker, I've had too much.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.358
Riker.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.058
Riker.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.479
- Were you having sexual

39:42.481 --> 39:44.381
relations with him?

39:44.383 --> 39:46.049
- No, not recently.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.084
- But you two were lovers.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.954
- No, once, just once,
I never should have,

39:50.956 --> 39:52.489
it was a mistake.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.823
It was a mistake.

39:53.825 --> 39:54.991
- Is that why you bit him?

39:54.993 --> 39:56.459
Was he trying to
force himself on you?

39:56.461 --> 39:57.627
- No, no, no.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.430
- Were you angry at him?

40:00.432 --> 40:02.499
- He was attacking me.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.500
- So it was self defense,

40:03.502 --> 40:04.968
you bit him to protect yourself?

40:07.706 --> 40:08.605
- No.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.690
- I wanna have a fucking
adult conversation with you.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.626
- Yeah, you're being
real adult right now.

40:29.628 --> 40:30.560
- Fuck you Abby!

40:30.562 --> 40:32.095
You sit at home alone all day,

40:32.097 --> 40:33.963
you won't leave the house,
you won't talk to anyone,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.632
just tell me what's going on.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.033
- You already know.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.936
- No, honey, I don't.

40:42.474 --> 40:43.907
I don't know.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.809
But I want to, just tell me.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.013
Abby, I wanna be there for you.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.148
I wanna help you, just
tell me what to do.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.871
Abby, there's nothing there.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.484
Abby?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.639
Abby what are you doing?

41:56.948 --> 41:58.915
Honey say something,
you're scaring me.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.654
- It was just me Caleb.

42:06.091 --> 42:09.559
The whole time we thought
I was something else.

42:11.630 --> 42:12.896
But it was just me.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.631
- What are
you talking about?

42:16.268 --> 42:18.001
Abby what are you doing?

42:18.003 --> 42:20.537
No, no, no, no, gimme that.

42:20.539 --> 42:23.273
No, let go, let go.

42:23.275 --> 42:26.709
Ah shit!

45:27.092 --> 45:29.025
She sleeps 16 hours a day.

45:31.162 --> 45:34.397
When she's awake she stares
at the window or the wall.

45:35.734 --> 45:37.400
Or she just draws that symbol.

45:44.142 --> 45:45.458
She's just not herself.

45:45.459 --> 45:46.775
I'm sorry about last
week, flipping out on you.

45:46.778 --> 45:49.345
- Yeah, that was a dick move.

45:49.347 --> 45:50.246
- I said I'm sorry.

45:51.483 --> 45:52.882
- Apology accepted.

45:59.791 --> 46:00.923
So who is she?

46:00.925 --> 46:02.425
- What?

46:02.427 --> 46:04.193
- You said she's not herself,
so have you put any thought

46:04.195 --> 46:05.795
into figuring out who she is?

46:05.797 --> 46:07.497
- What do you mean?

46:07.499 --> 46:09.532
- Look, I recommend that we
get professional fucking help.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.200
But since that's
not gonna happen,

46:11.202 --> 46:14.103
maybe we need to start
thinking outside the box.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.005
I know you're not the most
open minded person in the world

46:16.007 --> 46:17.774
but just hear me out, okay?

46:17.776 --> 46:19.375
- All right, I'm listening.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.110
- All of this started
happening after that night

46:21.112 --> 46:22.111
in the woods.

46:22.113 --> 46:23.813
Maybe something happened.

46:23.815 --> 46:26.315
- Okay, I was passed out and you

46:26.317 --> 46:29.952
and Abby went on some misguided
adventure through the woods.

46:31.256 --> 46:32.889
And you guys saw something.

46:32.891 --> 46:34.257
- I didn't see anything.

46:34.259 --> 46:35.792
- But you said,

46:35.793 --> 46:37.326
- No, I was telling you
about a dream that I had.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.862
It was all hazy and
fuzzy like dreams are.

46:39.864 --> 46:42.031
I don't actually remember
much from that night at all.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.866
- Well you were blackout drunk.

46:45.336 --> 46:46.469
- Maybe.

46:46.471 --> 46:49.189
She only had a couple of shots.

46:49.190 --> 46:51.908
- Yeah, and hits of whatever
the hell you put in that pot.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.343
- It was super mild.

46:54.345 --> 46:55.878
I know Abby has a
tendency to freak out,

46:55.880 --> 46:57.580
and I didn't want
things to go south.

46:57.582 --> 47:00.850
But the important point is
that we weren't hallucinating.

47:00.852 --> 47:02.552
- But you said you
didn't see anything.

47:02.554 --> 47:04.420
- No, I didn't.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.289
- What are you getting at?

47:06.291 --> 47:09.859
- Look, these were taken in
my yard, going all the way

47:09.861 --> 47:11.494
around my house
and into the back.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.213
- Riker, stop.

47:13.214 --> 47:14.931
- No, Caleb, these are way
too big to be animal tracks.

47:14.933 --> 47:16.599
They're proof.
- Riker stop!

47:16.601 --> 47:19.468
Okay, I don't care if you
believe this group delusion

47:19.470 --> 47:20.903
paranoid bullshit or not,

47:20.905 --> 47:22.972
but I will not be
a part of it, okay?

47:24.175 --> 47:26.242
- Caleb, she isn't telling
either of us what's really

47:26.244 --> 47:28.911
going on, she knows
more than she's saying.

47:28.913 --> 47:29.879
Caleb, wait.

47:37.555 --> 47:39.555
- What are you doing with that?

47:39.557 --> 47:40.556
- Waiting for you.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.625
- Yeah? So you feeling better?

47:42.627 --> 47:45.161
- That all
depends on you, baby.

47:45.163 --> 47:46.629
- What?

47:46.631 --> 47:48.264
- Come on, it's your
moment in the spotlight.

47:48.266 --> 47:49.532
Give us a show.

47:50.535 --> 47:52.569
- That's not funny Abby.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.604
- Aw come on baby,
it's a party, right?

47:54.606 --> 47:55.538
That's it?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.006
That's all you got?

47:57.007 --> 47:58.473
- Put the fucking
camera down, Abby.

47:58.476 --> 48:00.977
- Oh sorry baby, you
know what you boys do to me.

48:02.914 --> 48:03.646
It's criminal.

48:12.624 --> 48:15.024
He scares me, I don't
wanna be here anymore.

48:16.327 --> 48:18.394
- We have bigger
things to be scared of, Abby.

48:19.364 --> 48:20.529
- How's your mom?

48:22.333 --> 48:24.166
- She's gone.
- What?

48:24.168 --> 48:25.534
Since when?

48:25.536 --> 48:27.169
- About a week.

48:27.171 --> 48:29.605
She's disappeared before for
a couple days here and there,

48:29.607 --> 48:32.241
but never this long,
and Anna's freaking out,

48:32.243 --> 48:34.510
I can't even get her to go
to school or leave the house,

48:34.512 --> 48:36.095
or barely do anything at all.

48:36.096 --> 48:37.679
She just won't calm down,
she's driving me crazy.

48:37.682 --> 48:39.115
- Riker.

48:39.117 --> 48:42.018
She's only 12 years
old, cut her some slack.

48:46.324 --> 48:47.590
I'm sorry.

48:47.592 --> 48:48.524
- I think it
has something to do

48:48.526 --> 48:49.425
with the thing in the woods.

48:50.995 --> 48:52.495
- How?

48:52.497 --> 48:54.030
- It came to the house.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.233
Abby I need you to
talk to me about it.

48:57.235 --> 48:58.601
I need you to remember.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.071
Is Caleb home?

49:02.073 --> 49:06.075
- No, he stays
away most of the time.

49:06.077 --> 49:07.610
I think he's scared of me.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.312
- I'm coming over.
- Now?

49:09.314 --> 49:11.414
- I have to
figure this shit out.

49:23.695 --> 49:26.095
My name is Riker Trask,
I'm here with Abby Singer

49:26.097 --> 49:28.664
to discuss the events
of September seventh

49:28.666 --> 49:30.433
at Blackwood forest.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.001
- Riker, what are you doing?

49:32.003 --> 49:34.136
- Abby, do you
remember that night?

49:36.140 --> 49:37.640
- Yeah, don't you?

49:37.642 --> 49:39.308
- Tell me what happened.

49:44.082 --> 49:47.984
- We all went into the
woods, you and me and Caleb.

49:47.986 --> 49:50.987
And Caleb fell asleep.
- Go on.

49:54.225 --> 49:59.295
- And then we, you and me,
went for a walk together

50:00.131 --> 50:04.000
in the woods and then we,

50:04.002 --> 50:05.768
- After that.

50:05.770 --> 50:07.770
What happened after, Abby?

50:10.008 --> 50:12.274
- We saw something in the trees.

50:12.276 --> 50:15.778
- We didn't see
anything, you were alone.

50:19.017 --> 50:20.683
- No, no.
- Yes.

50:21.486 --> 50:24.754
- No, I saw you, you were there.

50:24.756 --> 50:26.655
- I wasn't there.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.090
Why are you lying?

50:30.495 --> 50:32.762
- Riker you were there,
you were right next to me.

50:32.764 --> 50:35.131
- Abby I wasn't there!

50:36.167 --> 50:37.333
You were alone.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.368
What did you see?

50:42.373 --> 50:43.239
- I,

50:44.642 --> 50:46.675
- Use your fucking words,
Abby, what did you see?

50:46.677 --> 50:48.711
- I saw, I saw,

50:50.214 --> 50:51.647
we saw something in the trees.

50:51.649 --> 50:54.116
- We didn't
see anything.

50:54.118 --> 50:55.751
It was you, try again.

50:58.089 --> 50:59.939
What did you see?

50:59.940 --> 51:01.790
- I saw, I saw a shadow
move in the trees.

51:01.793 --> 51:04.060
I saw a shadow move
in the trees and I--

51:05.129 --> 51:06.095
- What did
the shadow look like?

51:06.097 --> 51:08.097
- I, it was dark, I, I, I--

51:08.099 --> 51:10.800
- You saw it, tell me.

51:10.802 --> 51:14.070
- I was, I was alone and
I saw it in the trees

51:14.072 --> 51:15.471
and it,
- What did,

51:15.473 --> 51:16.439
what did it look like?

51:16.441 --> 51:19.208
- Well it had, it had, it had,

51:19.210 --> 51:20.476
- It had what?

51:20.478 --> 51:23.179
- It had red, red,
- It had red what?

51:23.181 --> 51:24.547
I need to know what was red.

51:24.549 --> 51:25.681
What was red?
- It was, it was,

51:25.683 --> 51:27.083
it was red eyes,

51:27.085 --> 51:28.584
it was I, I
- Good.

51:28.586 --> 51:30.319
- I saw red eyes in the trees.

51:30.321 --> 51:33.189
We, I, I was alone, I
saw red eyes in the trees

51:33.191 --> 51:34.557
and I saw,
- What else did you see?

51:35.827 --> 51:37.126
- Red eyes in the
trees, what else?

51:37.128 --> 51:38.260
- I, I, I, I,

51:38.262 --> 51:41.197
- Abby, red eyes
in the trees, what else?

51:41.199 --> 51:42.832
- I, I,
- I, I, I, I,

51:44.202 --> 51:45.634
I need a fucking sentence here!

51:45.636 --> 51:46.836
What did you see?

51:46.838 --> 51:48.237
- No! I don't know!
- You do know!

51:48.239 --> 51:49.705
- I saw it.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.240
- You saw it.
- I saw it.

51:51.242 --> 51:53.142
I was alone and I saw it.
- It came back with you.

51:53.144 --> 51:54.143
- I saw it, I,

52:00.351 --> 52:02.585
- Abby, I need
you to listen to me.

52:02.587 --> 52:03.786
You know what it wants.

52:03.788 --> 52:05.104
What does it want?

52:05.105 --> 52:06.421
- I don't know.
- Abby, tell me what it wants.

52:06.424 --> 52:07.623
You know what it wants,
you know what it wants.

52:07.625 --> 52:08.824
- Get the
fuck out of my house!

52:08.826 --> 52:09.658
- Get your hands off me.

52:09.660 --> 52:10.860
She knows what it wants!

52:10.862 --> 52:12.728
- It came back with,
and it came back with me

52:12.730 --> 52:14.630
and I saw it and I, I,

52:22.306 --> 52:23.706
It had red eyes.

52:27.578 --> 52:30.613
It had red, it had
red eyes and I saw it.

52:30.615 --> 52:34.216
And I brought it back
with me and I was,

52:36.287 --> 52:37.186
and I, I,

52:41.459 --> 52:42.591
I don't know.

52:44.795 --> 52:48.230
I don't know.

52:51.736 --> 52:54.770
- Hey Cara, been
a couple of days,

52:54.772 --> 52:57.173
I haven't heard
anything from you.

52:57.175 --> 52:58.841
Starting to get
a little worried.

53:00.678 --> 53:04.313
Just gimme a call back, lemme
know you're okay, alright?

53:12.190 --> 53:12.889
I miss you.

53:12.890 --> 53:13.589
I'll talk to you later, alright?

53:40.284 --> 53:43.285
- Riker, Riker leave
us the fuck alone.

53:49.527 --> 53:50.759
- Maybe I--

53:50.761 --> 53:52.328
- No, I don't want
you talking to him.

53:54.232 --> 53:55.231
It's for your own good.

54:37.275 --> 54:38.507
- I'm a bad person.

54:39.844 --> 54:41.443
- Me too.

54:41.445 --> 54:43.746
- No, I mean I slipped something

54:43.748 --> 54:44.747
into Caleb's drink.

54:47.051 --> 54:50.052
I wasn't trying to, I
just wanted to talk to you

54:51.355 --> 54:53.856
without Caleb telling
you what to say.

54:53.858 --> 54:55.724
- Caleb doesn't
tell me what to say.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.661
- I don't know what's
happened to him.

54:58.663 --> 54:59.962
He didn't used to be like this,

54:59.964 --> 55:03.365
and I hate the way
he talks to you.

55:04.702 --> 55:06.802
And I know he's going
out with other girls too,

55:06.804 --> 55:07.703
- I know.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.473
I've known for a long time.

55:12.710 --> 55:14.343
- Why don't you do anything?

55:15.613 --> 55:18.314
- I tried a couple of
times, it never worked.

55:18.316 --> 55:19.415
- Why?

55:21.819 --> 55:22.951
- He's a good talker.

55:28.893 --> 55:31.093
So you were trying to rescue me.

55:31.095 --> 55:33.829
- Yeah, I fucked that one up.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.167
- Yeah.

55:38.168 --> 55:38.900
- I wasn't trying to seduce you.

55:38.903 --> 55:40.869
- That is exactly
what you were doing.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.008
- It's getting closer.

55:51.082 --> 55:51.998
- I know.

55:51.999 --> 55:52.915
- I'm not gonna let it get you.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.511
- Where were you?

56:25.583 --> 56:26.682
- Does it really matter?

56:26.684 --> 56:28.550
- Yeah, it matters.

56:30.755 --> 56:33.155
Just tell me where you were.

56:34.158 --> 56:35.924
Were you with him?

56:46.971 --> 56:48.070
- Does it matter now?

56:48.072 --> 56:48.971
- Yeah.

56:54.612 --> 56:55.577
- What about now?

56:55.579 --> 56:57.579
- Yes, Abby it fucking matters.

56:59.784 --> 57:00.983
- What about now?

57:00.985 --> 57:02.017
Does it matter now?

57:07.057 --> 57:09.091
It doesn't fucking matter.

57:09.093 --> 57:09.992
Don't pretend.

57:31.849 --> 57:33.182
- I'm going out.

57:33.184 --> 57:34.917
I've gotta--
- Don't bother.

59:13.851 --> 59:15.551
- Hello?
- Is Caleb there?

59:15.553 --> 59:16.885
- He's out. What's wrong?

59:16.887 --> 59:18.153
- I need your help.

59:18.155 --> 59:19.321
- What are
you talking about?

59:19.323 --> 59:21.690
What do you need?
- It's mom, she's hurt.

59:21.692 --> 59:22.925
- Did you
call an ambulance?

59:22.927 --> 59:23.859
- I can't,
I can't explain.

59:23.861 --> 59:25.327
Look, can you get here soon?

59:25.329 --> 59:26.762
- Caleb left his car, I--

59:26.764 --> 59:28.263
- Get the
keys and take it.

59:28.265 --> 59:29.665
There isn't much time.

59:29.667 --> 59:31.383
- Is Anna okay?

59:31.384 --> 59:33.100
- She's
scared, please hurry.

59:33.103 --> 59:34.736
Abby, it's here.

59:51.655 --> 59:52.354
- Riker?

59:56.694 --> 59:57.593
Anna?

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:01.330
Are you here?

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:07.803
Oh my god.

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.815
Riker, what are you doing?

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.052
Riker say something.

01:02:39.523 --> 01:02:41.189
- What's up?

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:42.357
- Riker's dead.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:45.761
- What do you mean?

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:46.928
- I killed him.

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.799
- Where are you?

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:53.268
- Riker's.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.803
- All right,
stay there, I'm coming,

01:02:54.805 --> 01:02:55.937
just stay there.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.518
- Please answer
the question Miss singer.

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:49.958
- I don't remember,
I wasn't there.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:53.562
- Do you remember
seen Riker's mother?

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:55.397
Did you have anything
to do with that?

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:56.298
- No.

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.534
- Do you know
who killed her?

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:05.607
Did Riker do that?

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:14.049
- I wasn't there.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.194
- Caleb Sidolf?

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:28.330
- Yeah.

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.497
You could see her now.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:48.516
- How ya holding up?

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:07.502
You wanna talk
about what happened?

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:09.404
- What do you want to know?

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:14.075
- Cops told me you had
to fight Riker off.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.011
You had to kill him.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.914
They said it was
in self defense.

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:21.383
- Is Anna dead?

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.686
- They didn't tell you?

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.154
- They didn't tell me anything.

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.023
They just kept
asking me questions,

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:30.258
the same questions over
and over and over and--

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.593
- Maybe we shouldn't
talk about this.

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.494
- Tell me.

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:36.998
- They found Anna
dead in the bathroom.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.569
They think he killed her
right before you showed up.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.640
Miss Trask had been
dead for a few hours.

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:50.111
- Why would,

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.450
what else?

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:58.653
- You sure you wanna
talk about this?

01:05:58.655 --> 01:05:59.654
- What else?

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.126
- They found Cara Sexton dead.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:13.535
She was in the
cellar, half frozen.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.138
- Well,

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.609
that's too bad.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.578
- She'd been dead
for at least a week.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.213
- A week?

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:26.982
I just saw him the other day.

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.017
We were talking.

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:30.085
- I know.

01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:35.023
He'd been,

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:40.628
- Tell me.

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.299
- He'd been cutting
pieces off of her,

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:46.768
They don't know why.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.037
- He had to feed it.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:58.013
Did they tell you what I did?

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.549
- They said you killed him and
that it was in self defense.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.185
- No, I bit him.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.487
More than once.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:06.421
- You had to.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.090
- I liked it.

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.059
I didn't wanna stop.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:20.635
I think Riker finally
figured it out at the end.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.606
Do you wanna know what it wants?

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:48.763
- She's
been through a lot.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:52.167
It's normal that she might
act a little strange.

01:07:52.169 --> 01:07:53.635
- Strange how?

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:58.306
- Emotional outbursts,
feelings of guilt, anger,

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:02.677
she might disconnect,
acting apathetic or distant.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.646
But you have to remember
regardless of what she might

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.714
tell you, she's feeling
some very extreme

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.550
and conflicting
emotions right now.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:11.152
But it's important that
you help encourage her

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:13.388
to explore these feelings,
no matter how irrational

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.123
they may seem.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:16.691
- She said something
about when she bit him,

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.792
she liked it, she
didn't want it to stop.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.662
- Yes, she said
something similar to me

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.397
and I read the police report.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.532
- Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:25.867
- Psychosis takes
many different forms

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.103
in many different patients.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.404
- I looked it up online,
said there's something

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:32.439
called wendigo psychosis?

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.109
- Yes, I've heard of it.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.877
- Sounds a lot like this.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:38.313
- Look, I appreciate that
you're trying to help,

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:39.848
- She's trying to eat people.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.518
She thinks she's
turning into a monster.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.252
Sounds pretty spot on to me.

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:50.158
- Delusions take different
forms in different cultures.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.893
The psychosis you're
referring to is simply

01:08:51.895 --> 01:08:55.229
a hundred year old
mis-diagnosis of schizophrenia,

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:57.599
which I do not believe
Abby is suffering from.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.167
More likely, she's suffering
from post traumatic stress.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.737
She's feeling guilt and
anger over her decision

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.506
to defend herself--
- Is she gonna be okay?

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.577
- I'd like to keep her a few
more days for observation.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:20.388
- Whatcha looking at?

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:25.693
Anything going on out there?

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.531
- Not now, soon.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.399
- What's that?

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.368
- It's going to come.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.938
- You know what the doctor said?

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.640
Just reacting to things
that Riker planted

01:09:39.643 --> 01:09:42.877
in your brain, it's okay.

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:47.448
I'm not mad, I just want
you to come home soon.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.950
- You don't want me after this.

01:09:48.952 --> 01:09:50.585
I'm damaged goods.

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:52.487
- Don't say that.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.756
You'll get better.

01:09:54.758 --> 01:09:55.690
Things'll go back to
the way they were.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.258
- I don't want that anymore.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:02.330
- You don't mean that.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.265
- You're a dangerous
person, Caleb.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.502
You've done so many
awful things to me.

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:09.971
- It's in your head, Abby.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:12.240
Those are Riker's words.

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.416
- I think I'm done talking.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.339
- She doesn't talk anymore.

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.809
Doesn't really do
anything by herself.

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:55.550
Doctors keep saying
just give her time.

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.486
I see the looks they
give each other.

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:06.961
And her dad hasn't
come to see her.

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:11.733
Not that she'd want him
to, but still wish somebody

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:12.734
would show up.

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.404
Can't handle this by myself.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.873
Fuck, why should I have to?

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.382
Her insurance isn't great.

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:33.755
Pretty sure we're gonna
be in a lot of debt

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:34.889
once this is over.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.862
Keep worrying if they
can come after me

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.597
for something like that.

01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.932
Pretty shitty thing to
be thinking right now.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.843
Then one of the doctors say
that they wanna move her

01:11:55.845 --> 01:11:57.745
to a permanent facility.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.058
Feel like this is my fault.

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.062
I can't stand feeling like this.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.099
I'm 22 fucking years
old, why should I have

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:19.434
to deal with this?

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:28.443
Sometimes I hate her.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:31.346
And Riker.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:37.352
It's not her fault, but
I just wanna shake her

01:12:37.354 --> 01:12:38.870
and tell her to grow up

01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.387
and take some fucking
responsibility.

01:12:45.128 --> 01:12:46.094
She's right.

01:12:50.567 --> 01:12:53.067
I don't think I can
be with her anymore.

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:55.570
Not after this.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.476
I can't just abandon
her with nothing though.

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:06.881
I have to make her better.

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:14.489
I obviously won't
be posting this.

01:14:40.543 --> 01:14:41.843
- Can I help you?

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.144
- Did you see
somebody come through here?

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.545
- I didn't see no one.

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:46.047
- Now somebody
just knocked on my door,

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:46.981
and I was just wondering if
maybe you let somebody in,

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.182
- Listen man, I can't help you.

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:49.550
I'm sorry.
- Did you give somebody a key?

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:34.161
What the,

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:00.321
I'm going crazy.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:16.571
They're gonna move you to a
special facility next week.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.707
Between you and me, I
don't think these doctors

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:20.975
have a fucking clue.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:26.847
Shouldn't say this but,
my best friend's dead

01:16:26.849 --> 01:16:29.884
and nobody's here to
really answer my calls.

01:16:31.621 --> 01:16:33.988
You're the only person
I have left to talk to.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:40.695
I miss you Abby.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:45.366
I'm sorry for everything
I did to hurt you.

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:55.843
I don't think you're crazy,
if it's any consolation.

01:16:55.845 --> 01:16:57.144
I think you're just sick.

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:00.681
I don't know if
something caused it,

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.283
or if it's still causing it.

01:17:04.354 --> 01:17:06.854
If it's something in your
head or something else.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:10.791
- It's you.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.090
- Sir, you're
gonna have to get back,

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.059
give her some room.

01:18:19.796 --> 01:18:21.962
- He wants to kill me.

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.832
He wants to eat me.

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:34.742
- It's
alright, one more.

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.172
- She told me everything.

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:08.843
I didn't listen.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.750
There's this, ache.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:20.788
Hunger.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:24.358
I don't know what to call it.

01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:30.197
Like something's clawing
its way into my brain.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.268
You're not yourself.

01:19:39.509 --> 01:19:41.776
Something's making this happen.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:44.779
I have to believe that.

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.149
I have to find it.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:51.952
Make it stop.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:08.595
I have to find it
and make it stop.

01:26:10.599 --> 01:26:14.168
Riker knew first, then Abby.

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:17.237
Now I finally get it.

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:24.244
It becomes you,
then you become it.

01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:38.358
Or maybe it's the
other way around.
