WEBVTT

02:44.140 --> 02:45.674
Jesus.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.982
Can you leave the pitcher, please?

04:54.669 --> 04:58.107
My name is David Martin,
I come from Ohio.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.276
Not originally, of course.

05:02.278 --> 05:03.946
Where are you going?

05:06.682 --> 05:09.984
Down toward El Golfo de Mexico,

05:09.986 --> 05:13.887
some little town
I've never heard of.

05:13.889 --> 05:15.956
Plenty of those in Texas.

05:15.958 --> 05:19.028
- How far?
- A few hours.

05:25.001 --> 05:27.301
And you?
You are headed?

05:27.303 --> 05:28.670
South.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.606
On foot?

05:33.109 --> 05:35.577
No food? No water?

05:37.046 --> 05:38.979
Where did you start from?

05:38.981 --> 05:40.716
You ask a lot of questions.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.860
Your friend's a real charmer.

07:42.087 --> 07:45.130
God is funny.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.141
To bring you to me.

07:47.143 --> 07:49.343
I don't understand.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.881
Only a few miles
left, I think.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.282
I need to dry out a bit.

07:55.284 --> 07:56.785
Let me dry out.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.036
I saw a helicopter this morning.

08:56.011 --> 08:57.046
Yeah?

08:58.347 --> 09:00.115
Uh-huh.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.890
A police helicopter.

09:12.127 --> 09:14.463
Maybe they were
looking for somebody.

09:19.535 --> 09:20.970
Who knows?

09:27.376 --> 09:29.511
That was a long way back.

09:46.895 --> 09:48.330
You can talk to me.

09:53.902 --> 09:56.470
I know it's difficult.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.375
It's not easy, confession.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.410
Let me show you.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.385
I'm an alcoholic.

10:11.487 --> 10:13.155
That's no secret.

10:20.596 --> 10:22.131
Okay.

10:23.432 --> 10:26.035
Okay. <i>Entonces</i>...

10:27.403 --> 10:30.272
I loved a woman
and she loved me...

10:32.141 --> 10:35.344
but she had a husband,
a family...

10:38.013 --> 10:43.085
and I am a religious man.

10:55.664 --> 10:57.933
I never told
that to anyone.

11:16.952 --> 11:19.321
A new life awaits me
where I'm going.

11:24.326 --> 11:29.064
And it can be the same for you
right here, right now.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.065
There's power in confession.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.602
I don't believe
in your religion.

11:36.271 --> 11:38.607
Religion has nothing
to do with it.

11:42.277 --> 11:44.146
Whatever you've done...

11:46.982 --> 11:48.148
they'll find you.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.105
I'll have to tell them...

12:12.141 --> 12:14.443
when I get to town, you know.

12:23.519 --> 12:25.587
You'd do the same
if you were me.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.355
Don't come any closer.

12:28.357 --> 12:30.725
I want you
to give yourself to God,

12:30.727 --> 12:32.259
unburden your soul...

12:32.261 --> 12:33.360
Don't you come
any fucking closer.

12:33.362 --> 12:34.995
And no bars can hold you.

12:34.997 --> 12:36.129
Do you hear me?

12:37.533 --> 12:39.199
- Shut your mouth.
- You will forever be free

12:39.201 --> 12:40.400
because whatever you've
done he already knows.

12:40.402 --> 12:41.736
Shut your fucking...

16:28.463 --> 16:30.767
<i>A new life awaits me
where I'm going.</i>

16:32.267 --> 16:33.903
It can be the same for you.

17:25.855 --> 17:26.956
What?

17:27.857 --> 17:29.658
You're lost.

17:31.493 --> 17:33.261
I'm looking for the church.

17:34.596 --> 17:35.996
That way, padre.

18:59.015 --> 19:00.448
Celia?

19:05.387 --> 19:06.856
<i>Habla Espa√±ol?</i>

19:08.758 --> 19:10.059
No.

19:11.694 --> 19:12.962
Jesus.

19:13.763 --> 19:15.363
This way.

19:35.517 --> 19:37.385
This is yours.

19:43.926 --> 19:45.560
I hope it's okay.

19:46.062 --> 19:47.562
It's fine.

19:49.431 --> 19:51.633
Do you have a suitcase
or something?

19:55.738 --> 19:57.106
In the van.

19:57.940 --> 19:59.606
You should get it.

19:59.608 --> 20:01.911
It's not safe here at night.

20:08.617 --> 20:10.552
I just wanna sleep.

20:12.989 --> 20:16.558
Okay.
Just don't forget your suitcase.

20:41.017 --> 20:42.517
I told you.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.086
I'll call the chief.

20:46.088 --> 20:48.188
Chief?

20:48.190 --> 20:50.092
Yeah, he's the one in charge.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.792
All right. My turn.

21:24.060 --> 21:27.127
How you give a redneck
a circumcision?

21:27.129 --> 21:28.996
How?

21:28.998 --> 21:30.998
Kick his sister
in the jaw.

21:37.239 --> 21:39.175
I'm, uh, looking for the chief.

21:40.608 --> 21:41.844
You found him.

21:43.779 --> 21:46.782
My van was broken into
last night.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.651
Took everything I had.

21:51.553 --> 21:53.789
You just passing through,
I guess?

21:57.093 --> 21:59.195
I'm here to work, actually.

22:00.029 --> 22:01.663
At the church.

22:10.139 --> 22:11.974
Start from the beginning.

22:14.777 --> 22:17.745
Well, there's nothing
much to tell.

22:17.747 --> 22:21.682
I drove in late,
parked in front of the church,

22:21.684 --> 22:24.084
found where I'm staying,
and then fell asleep.

22:24.086 --> 22:25.653
By yourself?

22:26.989 --> 22:29.622
Did I sleep by myself?

22:29.624 --> 22:31.191
I don't care
who you sleep with, Reverend,

22:31.193 --> 22:33.162
I'm asking if
you're traveling alone.

22:35.164 --> 22:36.298
Yeah.

22:41.070 --> 22:44.738
Did you see anybody on
the way in or anybody see you?

22:44.740 --> 22:47.041
Well, there was a boy, Mexican.

22:47.043 --> 22:48.944
Hmm. We got a lot of those.

22:49.979 --> 22:52.748
But young, and... and alone.

22:53.883 --> 22:57.585
Late. Holding a tennis ball.

22:59.688 --> 23:03.123
This kid, he about 12 years old?

23:03.125 --> 23:07.027
And he had an older guy
with him about 20,

23:07.029 --> 23:10.931
rough looking dude,
tattoo of some chick on his arm?

23:10.933 --> 23:13.666
I heard a voice,
but I didn't see anyone.

23:13.668 --> 23:17.273
Lurking in the shadows,
probably waiting for a buyer.

23:18.007 --> 23:19.773
So you know him?

23:19.775 --> 23:21.875
I know everybody.

23:21.877 --> 23:23.779
Except you, I guess.

23:29.151 --> 23:31.819
Where are you from, Reverend?

23:31.821 --> 23:34.021
Originally,
where did you grow up?

23:34.023 --> 23:36.156
Oh... Ohio.

23:36.158 --> 23:37.293
Oh, yeah.

23:38.928 --> 23:41.230
You ever live
in a town like this?

23:42.364 --> 23:43.999
A small town?

23:45.968 --> 23:49.069
People think they got charm,
you know.

23:49.071 --> 23:50.904
Everybody knows everybody.

23:50.906 --> 23:54.274
One bar, one grocery,
one pizza joint.

23:54.276 --> 23:55.876
The judge and the preacher,

23:55.878 --> 23:58.080
they share the same building,
that kind of stuff.

24:00.015 --> 24:02.216
People think it's quaint.

24:02.218 --> 24:04.687
Maybe it was.

24:06.722 --> 24:12.261
Town like this, tight-knit,
safe and quiet, whistle-stop.

24:14.330 --> 24:18.232
Until they build the highway
a few miles off,

24:18.234 --> 24:20.200
pull all the commerce away

24:20.202 --> 24:22.805
and all the nice quiet folks
along with it.

24:24.006 --> 24:25.341
What's left?

24:28.310 --> 24:30.210
Yeah.

24:30.212 --> 24:33.447
All I'm saying is
this ain't Ohio.

24:33.449 --> 24:34.948
Now we're here to help you,

24:34.950 --> 24:36.383
but you can help yourself
an awful lot

24:36.385 --> 24:38.921
just by paying
a little attention, okay?

24:40.322 --> 24:41.757
Okay.

24:45.427 --> 24:48.264
You should have Celia
look at that hand.

24:49.498 --> 24:51.064
So, you know her, too?

24:51.066 --> 24:52.935
Like I said.

25:05.281 --> 25:07.049
What's the plate number?

25:12.988 --> 25:13.989
Reverend?

25:15.524 --> 25:18.794
- What?
- The plate number of the van?

25:20.829 --> 25:22.798
Oh, I don't know.

25:26.502 --> 25:28.404
Would somebody get that, please?

25:33.342 --> 25:35.442
Well, read this through,
sign it at that bottom.

25:35.444 --> 25:37.778
I'll have my boys get on it.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.481
Just don't expect a miracle.

25:43.052 --> 25:44.954
Hello, Bevel Police.

25:47.289 --> 25:49.024
Yeah, this is the chief.

25:51.527 --> 25:53.162
No.

25:55.931 --> 25:58.465
It's always on Sunday.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.736
Except when it's on Tuesday.

26:02.905 --> 26:05.341
I don't know.
I don't make the schedule.

26:45.848 --> 26:47.116
Poco, no.

26:48.192 --> 26:49.401
It's blood.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.318
Why is there blood?

26:51.320 --> 26:52.955
Who knows?

26:53.447 --> 26:55.032
Fuckin' white dudes.

26:59.862 --> 27:01.363
This shit is worth nothing.

27:12.908 --> 27:15.544
- Valentin, hey.
- Hm?

27:20.482 --> 27:22.891
It's like the flowers.

27:22.893 --> 27:24.269
At the quarry.

27:25.621 --> 27:27.823
Purple flowers are everywhere.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.984
Not like these.

27:32.928 --> 27:34.430
Do you think he was there?

27:36.823 --> 27:38.615
Stop messing around.

27:38.617 --> 27:40.202
Let's go tend our crop.

27:42.913 --> 27:44.540
Get the bag!

28:24.113 --> 28:26.982
Valentin, are you in there?

28:35.883 --> 28:37.624
I don't like going to the quarry.

28:37.626 --> 28:39.361
You like eating, don't you?

28:40.470 --> 28:42.181
I get scared.

28:43.849 --> 28:45.809
Stay on top then.

28:46.351 --> 28:47.978
Okay, hurry up!

29:08.999 --> 29:12.250
Hurry up, Valentin!

29:12.252 --> 29:14.004
Chill out, Poco!

30:27.669 --> 30:31.137
You should stay... just once.

30:31.139 --> 30:32.541
It'll be nice.

30:34.343 --> 30:36.612
I'll fix your breakfast
in the morning.

30:37.513 --> 30:39.047
I got to work.

30:43.218 --> 30:45.418
In the middle of the night?

30:45.420 --> 30:47.354
That's when the bugs come out.

30:47.356 --> 30:48.524
Come on, John.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.308
Stay.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.760
Don't beg.

30:52.762 --> 30:54.263
It makes you look weak.

31:06.275 --> 31:07.808
I didn't mean that.

31:07.810 --> 31:09.411
It's fine.

31:13.850 --> 31:16.552
He knows you're here.
The walls are thin.

31:20.322 --> 31:23.258
You think he'll stay longer
than the last one?

31:28.347 --> 31:30.474
I don't really care how long he stays.

31:36.204 --> 31:38.138
I like your flowers.

31:41.376 --> 31:42.712
They're fake.

31:49.384 --> 31:51.186
See you.

34:18.667 --> 34:20.368
Not many come.

34:22.504 --> 34:23.940
Some but...

34:30.312 --> 34:31.681
Hello?

34:33.348 --> 34:35.450
Hope you're not
expecting an answer.

34:38.353 --> 34:39.822
I couldn't help it.

34:42.058 --> 34:45.391
So, you got your first service.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.496
You got your work
cut out for you, huh?

34:49.832 --> 34:53.568
Well, I wanted you to know
I think I found your man...

34:54.636 --> 34:56.906
or your boys, I guess.

34:58.673 --> 35:01.508
With your case, your van.

35:01.510 --> 35:03.645
I'll be making an arrest soon.

35:05.114 --> 35:06.579
Who is it?

35:06.581 --> 35:08.416
I think you know who it is.

35:10.585 --> 35:13.655
What? You act like it's my fault
you come from criminals?

35:22.597 --> 35:24.098
They're her cousins.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.068
She's sensitive.

35:33.575 --> 35:35.508
I should get ready
for tonight.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.746
Do I know you?

35:41.017 --> 35:42.983
Well, what do you mean?

35:42.985 --> 35:45.620
Have we met somewhere
before you come here?

35:47.422 --> 35:48.823
Where would we have met?

35:48.825 --> 35:52.392
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

35:52.394 --> 35:54.864
I just feel like
I've seen you before.

35:56.464 --> 35:58.801
You spend much time in Ohio,
Chief?

36:04.606 --> 36:07.041
Have a good service,
Reverend.

36:07.043 --> 36:09.411
That is if anybody
shows up.

37:14.243 --> 37:20.546
Here's a trustworthy saying
that deserves full acceptance.

37:20.548 --> 37:25.487
"Christ Jesus came into the
world to save sinners,

37:26.956 --> 37:30.092
of whom I am chief."

37:34.697 --> 37:36.098
Chief.

38:08.530 --> 38:12.467
I will read from the book
of 1st Timothy Chapter One.

38:16.238 --> 38:22.843
"I thank Christ Jesus our Lord,
who has given me strength,

38:22.845 --> 38:28.782
that He considered me faithful,
appointing me to His service.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.318
Even though I was
once a blasphemer

38:31.320 --> 38:36.092
and a persecutor
and a violent man,

38:37.893 --> 38:42.264
I was shown mercy
because I acted in ignorance."

38:49.305 --> 38:51.273
Do you understand me?

38:52.308 --> 38:53.676
English?

38:55.745 --> 38:57.612
What would you like to know?

39:00.582 --> 39:03.719
Um, who are you?

39:08.357 --> 39:10.059
I am a sinner.

39:18.367 --> 39:20.136
Why are you here?

39:23.105 --> 39:29.676
Because the grace of our Lord
was poured out on me.

40:02.311 --> 40:04.211
I opened a bottle of wine.

40:04.213 --> 40:05.781
I hope you don't mind.

40:43.052 --> 40:44.220
He's not married.

40:47.890 --> 40:50.726
I mean, he was but his wife
died a few years ago.

40:52.461 --> 40:54.629
It's none of my business.

41:05.441 --> 41:07.910
I've known a few preachers
in my day.

41:09.845 --> 41:11.714
You're not like any of them.

41:12.982 --> 41:14.817
You mean I'm not Mexican?

41:17.720 --> 41:19.054
Besides that.

41:22.324 --> 41:25.895
Well, I wasn't raised
in the church.

41:27.930 --> 41:30.065
So, they haven't
worn you down yet?

41:41.310 --> 41:44.878
I came from Mexico with
my uncle when I was a teenager

41:44.880 --> 41:46.415
to help him with the church.

41:50.219 --> 41:52.154
I have been here ever since.

41:55.090 --> 41:56.425
That's a long time.

42:00.162 --> 42:01.430
Yes, it is.

42:12.875 --> 42:13.976
Poco...

42:14.952 --> 42:16.370
The minister.

42:18.881 --> 42:21.317
- No. No!
- What? What?

42:22.125 --> 42:24.086
It's a stupid robe.

42:28.882 --> 42:30.717
Where are the bloody clothes?

42:31.552 --> 42:33.160
The bloody clothes?

42:33.162 --> 42:36.332
The bloody clothes from the van.

42:37.182 --> 42:38.265
I don't know.

42:38.267 --> 42:41.520
You threw them
across the house, dummy.

42:42.271 --> 42:43.605
Go get them.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.400
We have to burn them.

42:48.443 --> 42:49.945
Hurry, let's go!

42:50.612 --> 42:52.197
Let's go, let's go!

43:22.769 --> 43:24.354
Run, Valentin.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.880
Garcia, you get Poco.
He went over there.

43:26.882 --> 43:28.248
- Hey, stop!
- Come here, boy.

43:31.186 --> 43:33.387
Get up here. Get up.

43:33.389 --> 43:34.990
Get down.

43:40.362 --> 43:42.462
I'm too damn old to be
chasing you around the woods

43:42.464 --> 43:44.199
like a fucking teenager, boy.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.335
Give me a break.

43:49.104 --> 43:52.539
All right,
you go search the trailer.

43:52.541 --> 43:55.377
I'm gonna take this little
dipshit down to the station.

43:56.078 --> 43:57.277
Come on.

43:57.279 --> 43:58.879
Garcia!

43:58.881 --> 44:00.647
He got away!

44:00.649 --> 44:02.933
Put out the damn fire then!

44:02.935 --> 44:06.730
Run, Poco! Never stop running!

44:07.089 --> 44:08.490
Oh, shit.

44:29.419 --> 44:34.132
I will rise and go to Jesus

44:36.260 --> 44:41.014
He will take me in His arms

44:42.057 --> 44:46.895
In the arms of my dear Savior

44:47.437 --> 44:50.983
O, there are ten-thousand charms

44:54.370 --> 44:55.371
Yeah?

45:07.082 --> 45:09.418
I can't sleep.
I heard you singing.

45:11.721 --> 45:13.389
You're lonely.

45:14.590 --> 45:16.550
Like all the others.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.964
That's not why I came.
I came to apologize.

45:23.365 --> 45:25.632
I didn't mean to cause trouble.

45:25.634 --> 45:28.402
Your cousins.

45:28.404 --> 45:31.004
Look, if they
stole your property,

45:31.006 --> 45:32.574
they must be held accountable.

45:34.610 --> 45:36.178
Are you close to them?

45:37.613 --> 45:38.614
No.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.385
But the song
that you're singing,

45:45.387 --> 45:49.256
is it, uh,
was it like a Mexican hymn?

45:49.258 --> 45:52.594
My uncle wouldn't let us sing
Mexican hymns, just American.

45:53.696 --> 45:55.230
To fit in, you know?

45:56.733 --> 45:58.265
But none of us
spoke much English

45:58.267 --> 46:00.202
so we just sang
the words in Spanish.

46:01.503 --> 46:03.372
That's why none of them rhyme.

46:05.742 --> 46:07.643
Well, it sounded nice.

46:15.250 --> 46:17.350
I should let you rest.

46:17.352 --> 46:19.388
You're really
not like the others.

46:24.660 --> 46:28.030
I have a lot of hate
in my heart, Reverend.

46:30.132 --> 46:31.567
I'm not proud of it.

46:33.469 --> 46:38.540
Do you, um...
do you need to be forgiven?

46:41.543 --> 46:43.612
You're not the one
who can forgive.

46:46.415 --> 46:47.684
Good night.

47:05.802 --> 47:07.669
Is this yours, Reverend?

47:10.672 --> 47:11.774
Yeah.

47:13.475 --> 47:15.678
Well, put some clothes on
and come with me.

47:24.178 --> 47:25.720
Give me a cigarette, Chief.

47:25.722 --> 47:28.123
Oh, you know me.
I don't smoke, <i>cabr√≥n.</i>

47:29.591 --> 47:31.258
The night you got to town,

47:31.260 --> 47:33.493
the boy you saw,
this is his brother.

47:33.495 --> 47:36.129
Blanco!

47:36.131 --> 47:39.165
This a-hole uses
a pre-teen to push his dope.

47:39.167 --> 47:42.202
Can you believe that?

47:42.204 --> 47:44.606
Anyhow, just thought
you'd want to see.

47:47.476 --> 47:52.512
Well, theft is
one thing, Valentin.

47:52.514 --> 47:56.483
Destroying evidence
is another.

47:56.485 --> 48:00.656
Of course, if I were you,
I would've started with this.

48:02.457 --> 48:04.226
Whose blood is that?

48:06.528 --> 48:08.428
Tell me it's yours.

48:08.430 --> 48:09.764
Please don't say it belongs

48:09.766 --> 48:11.732
to some pothead
that pissed you off.

48:11.734 --> 48:12.800
It's his.

48:12.802 --> 48:14.200
Who?

48:16.371 --> 48:18.171
- No shit?
- It's true.

48:18.173 --> 48:20.841
Yeah, we found these clothes
in your trailer, dickhead,

48:20.843 --> 48:22.642
and not in his boxes.

48:22.644 --> 48:24.712
Now, here's how I see it.

48:24.714 --> 48:27.848
I think somebody stepped to you
when you were robbing that van

48:27.850 --> 48:30.383
and shit got out of hand.

48:30.385 --> 48:33.286
That tells me we got
a victim somewhere.

48:33.288 --> 48:37.925
Either dead
or extremely fucking injured.

48:37.927 --> 48:39.461
Am I right?

48:41.630 --> 48:42.799
Hmm.

48:44.299 --> 48:45.802
That's what I thought.

48:51.908 --> 48:53.208
Come on.

49:02.351 --> 49:04.486
A lot of purple flowers.

49:06.588 --> 49:08.657
Why were you at the quarry?

49:23.973 --> 49:25.806
Sorry, there ain't more.

49:25.808 --> 49:29.442
They burned the rest
before we found them.

49:29.444 --> 49:32.381
You just sign this here
and you can take what's left.

49:33.582 --> 49:37.417
No luck on the tires,
sorry.

49:37.419 --> 49:41.655
But there's an auto store
out on the highway.

49:41.657 --> 49:44.391
I can't afford new tires.

49:44.393 --> 49:48.261
Not getting rich off
of the collection plate, huh?

49:48.263 --> 49:51.533
Maybe you should watch some
TV preachers, get some tips.

49:53.970 --> 49:56.236
You're not a big smiler,
are you?

49:56.238 --> 49:58.471
That's cool.

49:58.473 --> 50:01.508
What happens now?
Him?

50:01.510 --> 50:04.979
He'll stay here
until the next circuit court.

50:04.981 --> 50:08.314
We do one of those in the church
every couple of months.

50:08.316 --> 50:11.186
We'll find his brother
in the meantime.

50:13.622 --> 50:17.390
It's just some clothes to me.
Just stuff.

50:17.392 --> 50:18.961
It's no big deal, really.

50:20.963 --> 50:24.732
Breaking the law
ain't a big deal?

50:24.734 --> 50:27.369
I just don't think it's worth
the trouble, that's all.

50:28.603 --> 50:30.472
Look, I know what you're doing.

50:35.277 --> 50:38.679
Turn the other cheek,
second chances, forgiveness.

50:38.681 --> 50:39.914
I get it.

50:39.916 --> 50:42.049
But here's the problem,
Reverend.

50:42.051 --> 50:46.555
Forgiveness only works in a world
where people learn their lessons.

50:48.390 --> 50:51.828
But they don't,
not here anyway.

50:55.865 --> 50:57.867
Thank you for finding my stuff.

51:29.631 --> 51:30.833
Blanco.

52:10.405 --> 52:13.841
<i>"But now a
righteousness from God,</i>

52:13.843 --> 52:17.612
<i>which is apart from law,
has been made known."</i>

52:25.554 --> 52:30.057
"This righteousness from God comes
through faith in Jesus Christ

52:30.059 --> 52:32.492
to all who believe."

52:39.601 --> 52:41.401
"There is no difference."

52:42.705 --> 52:45.638
"So we are made right with God

52:45.640 --> 52:48.108
through faith in Jesus."

52:52.547 --> 52:54.682
"Not by obeying the law."

53:07.897 --> 53:09.629
We have not been spoken to

53:09.631 --> 53:13.401
the way that you speak to us,
without judgement.

53:16.605 --> 53:18.638
I just say the words.

53:18.640 --> 53:21.909
It's not me
that you are here for.

53:25.147 --> 53:28.617
It's the words.
It's the book.

53:29.517 --> 53:30.619
I...

53:34.556 --> 53:36.625
I don't know what I say.

53:38.051 --> 53:41.928
I give myself to you, Lord.

53:41.930 --> 53:44.641
Because I am hopeless.

53:45.601 --> 53:47.811
And because I have failed.

53:51.607 --> 53:53.650
I am the dirt.

53:54.651 --> 53:57.946
I am lower than low.

53:58.697 --> 54:03.327
I am beyond hope
in the eyes of man.

54:21.170 --> 54:23.973
Rosario has something she would
like to ask you, Reverend.

54:29.577 --> 54:32.048
She wants to be baptized.

54:42.524 --> 54:45.125
It's funny in this room.

54:45.127 --> 54:47.495
The world don't look
the same from in here.

54:50.933 --> 54:55.102
Now, you don't
wanna be here, do you?

54:55.104 --> 54:57.705
Sleeping on the floor
wearing dirty clothes,

54:57.707 --> 54:59.842
eating shit
I wouldn't feed the dog.

55:00.876 --> 55:02.542
Three days now.

55:02.544 --> 55:04.311
Don't you wanna be
somewhere comfortable?

55:04.313 --> 55:06.546
I want to be home.

55:06.548 --> 55:09.083
Well, then, help me out.

55:09.085 --> 55:10.920
Speak a little truth.

55:14.056 --> 55:16.724
You got a hideout in the woods
somewhere or a tent,

55:16.726 --> 55:18.092
something like that?

55:20.595 --> 55:22.696
He's a little kid, man.

55:22.698 --> 55:25.631
He's out there by himself right
now probably scared to death.

55:25.633 --> 55:27.803
He'd be safer here with us.

55:30.706 --> 55:33.707
And then, Valentin,

55:33.709 --> 55:36.110
my boys went back out
at your place yesterday,

55:36.112 --> 55:38.180
found quite a stash.

55:40.683 --> 55:43.050
Breaking into cars,
growing weed.

55:43.052 --> 55:45.921
You got yourself quite a little
criminal enterprise, don't' you?

55:46.856 --> 55:48.856
Where do you grow it?

55:48.858 --> 55:52.100
Hey, where does this come from?

55:52.102 --> 55:54.521
Why don't you ask the Reverend?

56:07.143 --> 56:08.950
You write your name
on the wall yet?

56:08.952 --> 56:10.245
Where is he going?

56:10.645 --> 56:12.679
Don't worry about him.

56:12.681 --> 56:14.882
Come on now.
It's a tradition.

56:14.884 --> 56:16.786
Don't want me
to forget you, do you?

56:21.057 --> 56:23.323
- Where you going?
- Not far.

56:23.325 --> 56:26.729
You remember where your crop is,
I'll come right on back.

56:44.380 --> 56:46.646
You see Poco around?

56:47.783 --> 56:49.326
My family of criminals?

56:50.820 --> 56:52.886
Hey.

56:52.888 --> 56:55.222
All right, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

56:55.224 --> 56:57.124
I mean, the little one,
he's got no choice.

56:57.126 --> 56:59.293
But I got some
questions for him.

56:59.295 --> 57:01.061
Nope.
I haven't seen them.

57:01.063 --> 57:02.131
Yeah.

57:03.365 --> 57:06.333
I see how
you watch out for him.

57:06.335 --> 57:09.303
Even from a distance
more than his mom had ever did.

57:09.305 --> 57:11.772
Now, did he say anything to you?
Where he was going?

57:11.774 --> 57:14.743
John, I don't know.
I told you.

57:15.344 --> 57:16.679
All right.

57:18.214 --> 57:20.380
Sorry.

57:20.382 --> 57:23.050
He's with Valentin.
He always is.

57:23.052 --> 57:26.388
Not today,
unless he's hiding in that cell.

57:27.857 --> 57:29.189
What do you mean?

57:29.191 --> 57:30.326
Chief.

57:32.862 --> 57:36.999
Valentin... he remembered.

57:45.632 --> 57:46.715
Valentin...

57:46.717 --> 57:50.596
Dummy...
Always in trouble.

57:51.597 --> 57:54.349
I have to fix your mess.

58:13.035 --> 58:14.136
Reverend.

58:22.011 --> 58:26.046
<i>"When we were baptized
into union with Christ Jesus."</i>

58:30.052 --> 58:33.120
"We were baptized
into union with his death."

58:38.260 --> 58:41.795
"We were buried with him
and shared his death."

58:45.968 --> 58:50.339
<i>"So that we might also
be raised, to live a new life."</i>

58:57.880 --> 58:59.348
A new life.

59:17.900 --> 59:19.068
Poco!

59:39.955 --> 59:41.357
Hallelujah!

59:49.598 --> 59:51.100
Jesus.

1:00:34.143 --> 1:00:36.076
- Get off of me!
- Hush up.

1:00:36.078 --> 1:00:39.112
- Get off!
- I said hush up!

1:00:39.114 --> 1:00:41.348
Same lies, all the same lies.

1:00:41.350 --> 1:00:42.985
- He was there!
- Purple flowers.

1:00:45.062 --> 1:00:46.486
Fuck you!

1:00:46.488 --> 1:00:47.812
I didn't mean to do that.

1:00:47.814 --> 1:00:48.897
Asshole!

1:00:48.899 --> 1:00:50.067
Calm down!

1:00:53.295 --> 1:00:55.464
Get something
to bandage the boy.

1:00:59.451 --> 1:01:01.036
Look at this!

1:01:02.004 --> 1:01:04.438
You do this to a boy
for some fucking pot?

1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.675
Oh, no. No, no.

1:01:07.677 --> 1:01:11.411
Pot's the least
of your worries now.

1:01:11.413 --> 1:01:15.184
We found a body, a dead body.

1:01:19.689 --> 1:01:21.323
In the quarry?

1:01:22.524 --> 1:01:24.358
That's right.

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:26.962
With purple flowers
all around.

1:01:27.563 --> 1:01:30.297
Yeah?

1:01:30.299 --> 1:01:35.535
I know this because we stole
his boxes, his clothes.

1:01:35.537 --> 1:01:38.640
The flowers were inside.
Yeah.

1:01:40.008 --> 1:01:41.443
That's what Poco told you.

1:01:42.511 --> 1:01:47.314
Yeah.
Our stories match.

1:01:47.316 --> 1:01:50.052
Matching stories
ain't hard to do.

1:01:52.221 --> 1:01:54.323
I killed no man.

1:01:57.384 --> 1:02:00.179
Look into the new man's eyes

1:02:01.471 --> 1:02:03.348
and ask him about the quarry.

1:02:06.852 --> 1:02:09.313
They will not look like mine.

1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:14.510
Truth, Chief.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.307
<i>"And I heard a voice
from heaven saying,</i>

1:02:47.309 --> 1:02:49.978
'Write these words.'"

1:02:56.285 --> 1:02:58.084
"'Blessed are the dead,

1:02:58.086 --> 1:03:00.620
who will from now on die
in the Lord.'"

1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:08.128
"'Yes, ' says the spirit.

1:03:08.130 --> 1:03:10.630
'They will rest
from their labors

1:03:10.632 --> 1:03:14.702
for their deeds follow them
wherever they go.'"

1:03:22.478 --> 1:03:23.579
Celia?

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:48.403
I know you are here today
because of a man.

1:03:57.613 --> 1:03:59.782
Did anyone know him?

1:04:19.501 --> 1:04:22.304
If anyone would
like to say anything?

1:04:37.152 --> 1:04:38.821
He wants you to pray.

1:04:40.589 --> 1:04:41.590
Pray?

1:04:42.591 --> 1:04:43.726
Yes.

1:05:03.746 --> 1:05:04.847
Our Father...

1:05:35.678 --> 1:05:37.346
Amen.

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:54.831
That's the most folks I've
seen in this building in a long time.

1:05:56.398 --> 1:05:58.500
You must be the real deal.

1:06:01.336 --> 1:06:05.674
I guess you heard
what we found out at the quarry.

1:06:06.743 --> 1:06:08.642
Everybody heard.

1:06:08.644 --> 1:06:11.246
Hmm. But I got him.

1:06:12.247 --> 1:06:13.647
I heard that, too.

1:06:13.649 --> 1:06:17.317
The wolves beat us
to him though, or dogs,

1:06:17.319 --> 1:06:18.886
some kind of animal.

1:06:18.888 --> 1:06:20.988
Gnawed the flesh off his body.

1:06:20.990 --> 1:06:23.423
Plucked out his eyes.
Ate his tongue.

1:06:23.425 --> 1:06:25.860
But, it all adds up:

1:06:25.862 --> 1:06:28.261
the evidence, bloody clothes,
and all that.

1:06:28.263 --> 1:06:30.931
Guy must've snuck up on him
after their stash.

1:06:30.933 --> 1:06:32.767
He surprised them.
They panicked.

1:06:32.769 --> 1:06:38.407
And then instinct,
the lizard brain.

1:06:40.609 --> 1:06:41.976
Who was he?

1:06:41.978 --> 1:06:44.812
Yeah. We didn't find an ID.

1:06:44.814 --> 1:06:47.282
Probably just another illegal.

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:50.851
More of them around here
than you can imagine,

1:06:50.853 --> 1:06:52.587
more coming every day.

1:06:55.725 --> 1:06:58.826
Kind of what I was expecting
with you, to be honest.

1:06:58.828 --> 1:07:01.528
You thought I'd be an illegal?

1:07:01.530 --> 1:07:03.432
A minority.

1:07:04.599 --> 1:07:06.834
We're all minorities now, right?

1:07:06.836 --> 1:07:08.670
This part of the country?

1:07:10.773 --> 1:07:13.341
Last I checked, I was white.

1:07:20.049 --> 1:07:23.418
Jesus made things too easy.

1:07:24.854 --> 1:07:27.620
Forgiveness,
all you got to do is ask.

1:07:27.622 --> 1:07:30.727
Nobody's got to be responsible
for what they've done.

1:07:33.361 --> 1:07:37.330
My daddy wore
this badge 33 years.

1:07:37.332 --> 1:07:39.466
It was a good job back then.

1:07:39.468 --> 1:07:41.468
You get to help people,
you know.

1:07:41.470 --> 1:07:42.770
He was like the mayor.

1:07:42.772 --> 1:07:44.071
People waved to him

1:07:44.073 --> 1:07:47.440
when he walked into town
on Sunday afternoon.

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:49.977
They were glad to see him.

1:07:49.979 --> 1:07:53.613
I always thought that was cool.

1:07:53.615 --> 1:07:56.651
Wanted that for myself
when I grew up.

1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:01.088
But it ain't cool.

1:08:01.090 --> 1:08:04.725
And nobody's ever
glad to see me.

1:08:04.727 --> 1:08:08.330
All I do is run around
sweeping mud off the streets.

1:08:10.365 --> 1:08:12.467
What's that got to do
with forgiveness?

1:08:15.037 --> 1:08:17.337
Well, it's hard
to stay clean

1:08:17.339 --> 1:08:19.374
when everything you
touch is dirty.

1:08:21.443 --> 1:08:23.913
They're saying things
about you, Reverend.

1:08:25.681 --> 1:08:27.850
The boys in that cell.

1:08:30.452 --> 1:08:33.622
Well, people will say anything
to save themselves.

1:08:38.393 --> 1:08:41.496
The body,
it needs to be buried.

1:08:43.665 --> 1:08:45.065
So soon?

1:08:45.067 --> 1:08:47.467
Yeah, we got the fingerprints
and all that,

1:08:47.469 --> 1:08:49.703
the official stuff.

1:08:49.705 --> 1:08:51.772
Nothing's gonna come of it.

1:08:51.774 --> 1:08:54.875
That's the risk you take
crossing over.

1:08:54.877 --> 1:08:57.945
But the poor bastard
took blunt trauma to the skull.

1:08:57.947 --> 1:09:00.883
The least we can do is give him
some restful peace.

1:09:02.551 --> 1:09:03.618
Will you do it?

1:09:04.586 --> 1:09:05.755
It's my job.

1:09:12.929 --> 1:09:14.997
Hey, your wife.

1:09:18.466 --> 1:09:20.402
Is that how she died?

1:09:21.904 --> 1:09:23.706
Was it a Mexican?

1:09:27.043 --> 1:09:28.376
No.

1:09:30.445 --> 1:09:33.446
She lost control of her car
out on Highway 2.

1:09:33.448 --> 1:09:34.748
It was raining.

1:09:34.750 --> 1:09:37.019
She got T-boned by a semi.

1:09:39.021 --> 1:09:40.690
Never knew what hit her.

1:10:10.169 --> 1:10:11.753
I brought you this.

1:10:15.632 --> 1:10:17.509
Your brother needs it.

1:10:19.887 --> 1:10:21.471
Valentin, don't be a fool.

1:10:51.919 --> 1:10:53.212
I can take care of him.

1:10:57.900 --> 1:10:59.341
No.

1:10:59.343 --> 1:11:00.677
Not in here you can't.

1:11:02.429 --> 1:11:04.389
Suddenly we matter to you?

1:11:07.309 --> 1:11:09.019
You call me a fool

1:11:10.979 --> 1:11:13.607
but you live in a house of lies.

1:11:14.942 --> 1:11:17.234
You deserve each other.

1:11:17.236 --> 1:11:19.319
A liar in bed with a liar.

1:11:19.321 --> 1:11:20.322
Shut up!

1:11:21.281 --> 1:11:23.114
John is a good man.

1:11:23.116 --> 1:11:24.910
He has a good heart.

1:11:25.953 --> 1:11:27.244
He will find the truth.

1:11:27.246 --> 1:11:29.496
He will be just. You'll see.

1:11:29.498 --> 1:11:31.750
I'm not talking about the Chief.

1:12:15.711 --> 1:12:17.678
My daddy used to say,

1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:20.014
"You wanna catch a killer,
you go to the funeral.

1:12:20.016 --> 1:12:23.250
Look for anyone there
who shouldn't be.

1:12:23.252 --> 1:12:24.854
That's your man."

1:12:30.059 --> 1:12:33.894
Nobody here today though,
except Jonas.

1:12:33.896 --> 1:12:35.765
Hey, Jonas.
You kill this guy?

1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:40.102
That's what I thought.

1:12:41.370 --> 1:12:43.103
Go ahead.

1:12:43.105 --> 1:12:46.709
I'll, uh,
I'll just read a verse.

1:12:53.249 --> 1:12:55.315
"In the place of the dead,

1:12:55.317 --> 1:12:59.820
there's excitement
over your arrival.

1:12:59.822 --> 1:13:03.891
The spirits of world leaders
and mighty kings long dead,

1:13:03.893 --> 1:13:05.660
stand up to see you.

1:13:07.696 --> 1:13:10.697
Everyone there
will stare at you and ask,

1:13:10.699 --> 1:13:13.300
'Can this be the one
who shook the earth

1:13:13.302 --> 1:13:15.903
and made the kingdoms
of the world tremble?

1:13:15.905 --> 1:13:18.739
Is this the one
who destroyed the world

1:13:18.741 --> 1:13:21.911
and made it into
a waste land?

1:13:24.346 --> 1:13:28.382
Is this the king who demolished
the world's greatest cities

1:13:28.384 --> 1:13:30.820
and had no mercy
on his prisoners?'

1:13:33.122 --> 1:13:36.323
And with one voice
they will all cry out,

1:13:36.325 --> 1:13:39.193
'Rejoice.'

1:13:39.195 --> 1:13:43.332
For now,
you are as weak as we are."

1:13:45.167 --> 1:13:47.336
That's a weird fucking verse.

1:13:50.239 --> 1:13:51.606
Amen.

1:14:19.835 --> 1:14:21.636
Can't help you,
unless you talk.

1:14:22.738 --> 1:14:27.274
I've been here days. Days.

1:14:27.276 --> 1:14:30.177
Listen, I'm the only public
defender in a three-county area.

1:14:30.179 --> 1:14:32.846
That's a lot of people, okay?

1:14:32.848 --> 1:14:35.082
Now, I'm sorry you've been waiting
here longer than you cared to,

1:14:35.084 --> 1:14:36.850
but that's just the way it is.
Things take time.

1:14:36.852 --> 1:14:38.385
Would not take time,
if we were white.

1:14:38.387 --> 1:14:40.087
Takes time if you're
white or black,

1:14:40.089 --> 1:14:41.822
or pink and purple polka dots.

1:14:41.824 --> 1:14:43.859
The policeman hates us.

1:14:46.362 --> 1:14:47.696
Hates our skin.

1:14:49.198 --> 1:14:51.265
Policeman hates criminals.

1:14:51.267 --> 1:14:53.068
Are you a criminal?

1:14:54.403 --> 1:14:56.270
I'll never get a fair trial.

1:14:56.272 --> 1:14:57.905
Not with a white lawyer.

1:14:57.907 --> 1:15:00.407
You watch too much damn TV.

1:15:00.409 --> 1:15:02.442
I had a cousin
married to a Latina.

1:15:03.846 --> 1:15:05.714
- What?
- Leave.

1:15:08.484 --> 1:15:09.685
Okay.

1:15:16.859 --> 1:15:19.061
These are some
serious charges, son.

1:15:20.396 --> 1:15:22.095
It's drugs today,
but they tell me

1:15:22.097 --> 1:15:24.364
it's soon to be murder.

1:15:24.366 --> 1:15:27.000
You'd be wise
to swallow some of that pride

1:15:27.002 --> 1:15:30.170
and accept
the help of the state.

1:15:30.172 --> 1:15:34.007
You're a young man.
You got some life yet to live.

1:15:34.009 --> 1:15:35.375
And your little brother
back there,

1:15:35.377 --> 1:15:37.446
he ain't hardly
lived his life yet at all.

1:15:40.015 --> 1:15:42.418
Do yourself a favor
and think about that, all right?

1:15:44.420 --> 1:15:45.754
Adios.

1:16:08.844 --> 1:16:10.246
I'm sorry.

1:16:11.446 --> 1:16:12.656
For what?

1:16:15.451 --> 1:16:17.419
Plenty of things, I'm sure.

1:16:20.422 --> 1:16:21.890
These are real.

1:16:27.830 --> 1:16:29.098
Come in.

1:16:48.017 --> 1:16:50.117
<i>This is kind of
a weird question,</i>

1:16:50.119 --> 1:16:52.388
<i>but do you remember
what his bandage looked like?</i>

1:16:55.324 --> 1:16:59.393
The night he came to town, he had a...
a bandage on his hand,

1:16:59.395 --> 1:17:01.595
you remember
what it looked like?

1:17:01.597 --> 1:17:03.330
Yeah.
It was bloody.

1:17:03.332 --> 1:17:06.933
But was it like a...
a bandana or a piece of cloth

1:17:06.935 --> 1:17:09.405
or maybe a sleeve?

1:17:10.439 --> 1:17:11.905
A sleeve?

1:17:11.907 --> 1:17:14.476
I just wondered if you remember.

1:17:16.178 --> 1:17:18.512
That's a weird detail
to worry about.

1:17:18.514 --> 1:17:21.283
Well, no detail is too small.

1:17:25.954 --> 1:17:30.926
I have to study the clues
with great care and attention.

1:17:35.297 --> 1:17:37.599
Using a delicate touch...

1:17:41.437 --> 1:17:45.941
with force when necessary.

1:17:53.582 --> 1:17:55.250
Yo, Chief, come quick!

1:18:02.291 --> 1:18:04.091
What is it?

1:18:04.093 --> 1:18:05.994
You wouldn't believe
if I told you.

1:18:06.628 --> 1:18:07.963
Come on.

1:18:31.387 --> 1:18:34.923
Pardon my Espa√±ol, Reverend,
but you look like shit.

1:18:37.359 --> 1:18:40.028
Well, this ought to
cheer you up.

1:18:41.130 --> 1:18:44.564
He confessed, Valentin,

1:18:44.566 --> 1:18:48.036
to the van, the dope,
the dead man, all of it.

1:18:50.105 --> 1:18:52.439
Why would he confess?

1:18:52.441 --> 1:18:56.078
Because he did it,
and he's in a cage.

1:18:57.179 --> 1:18:58.580
And his brother?

1:19:00.015 --> 1:19:02.717
Valentin swears he acted alone.

1:19:02.719 --> 1:19:04.418
Probably not true, of course,

1:19:04.420 --> 1:19:07.755
but at this point,
it's a deal I can take.

1:19:07.757 --> 1:19:10.691
I'm gonna need a statement
from you, in court,

1:19:10.693 --> 1:19:14.596
testimony about the van and all,
it won't be much.

1:19:17.734 --> 1:19:19.368
Mm-hmm.

1:19:21.236 --> 1:19:23.505
Guilt's a heavy burden,
ain't it, Reverend?

1:19:24.741 --> 1:19:27.309
Most men can't carry it alone.

1:19:35.617 --> 1:19:37.052
Feel better.

1:20:01.744 --> 1:20:03.378
It's over now.

1:20:05.514 --> 1:20:07.449
How does that feel?

1:20:10.820 --> 1:20:14.323
<i>You can just sail away.</i>

1:20:57.566 --> 1:21:00.235
- You have five minutes.
- Thank you.

1:21:18.153 --> 1:21:20.420
They will hang you.

1:21:20.422 --> 1:21:22.692
Better only me
than my brother, too.

1:21:26.595 --> 1:21:28.161
Let me pray with you.

1:21:28.163 --> 1:21:30.230
What do you wanna pray for?

1:21:32.869 --> 1:21:34.202
For this?

1:21:35.304 --> 1:21:36.605
For Poco?

1:21:37.774 --> 1:21:40.373
Listen to me,

1:21:40.375 --> 1:21:43.811
whatever you've done,
whatever put you in here...

1:21:43.813 --> 1:21:45.245
You put me in here!

1:21:48.216 --> 1:21:49.784
Tell me your name.

1:21:49.786 --> 1:21:52.485
Please just...
just pray with me.

1:21:52.487 --> 1:21:54.791
Tell me your name.

1:21:59.595 --> 1:22:01.378
Our father...

1:22:01.380 --> 1:22:02.863
Liar!

1:22:02.865 --> 1:22:04.732
You are no preacher, <i>cabr√≥n!</i>

1:22:04.734 --> 1:22:06.716
- Oh, Father, we pray to you...
- No!

1:22:06.718 --> 1:22:08.568
God does not hear your words!

1:22:08.570 --> 1:22:09.896
We ask for your forgiveness,
Father.

1:22:09.898 --> 1:22:12.814
- Shut up! It is a lie!
- Have mercy.

1:22:12.816 --> 1:22:14.766
It's a lie! Fucking asshole!

1:22:14.768 --> 1:22:16.186
Shut up! Liar!

1:22:16.378 --> 1:22:17.845
Listen to me.
Just listen to me!

1:22:17.847 --> 1:22:18.937
Get back!

1:22:18.939 --> 1:22:20.983
Liar! Liar!

1:22:21.216 --> 1:22:22.885
You are no man of God.

1:22:24.528 --> 1:22:26.778
You will burn in Hell, asshole!

1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:29.364
There is nothing you can do
to make this right.

1:22:29.366 --> 1:22:30.523
You will burn!

1:22:30.525 --> 1:22:31.741
Settle down!

1:22:31.743 --> 1:22:33.287
I will see you there!

1:23:16.571 --> 1:23:18.240
<i>Right here, right now.</i>

1:23:19.341 --> 1:23:21.243
There is power in confession.

1:23:45.835 --> 1:23:47.602
Call the first witness.

1:23:58.881 --> 1:24:02.250
Put right hand on the Bible
and your left hand in the air.

1:24:07.622 --> 1:24:09.790
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1:24:09.792 --> 1:24:12.227
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1:24:14.563 --> 1:24:15.696
I do.

1:24:15.698 --> 1:24:18.567
Hm. State your name
for the record.

1:24:23.039 --> 1:24:25.007
State your name
for the record, please.

1:24:31.446 --> 1:24:33.348
Are you David Martin?

1:24:38.721 --> 1:24:41.521
Are you the Reverend
David Martin?

1:24:41.523 --> 1:24:43.325
I'm sorry...
sorry, Your Honor.

1:24:46.829 --> 1:24:48.296
I'm sorry.

1:24:50.833 --> 1:24:54.769
Your Honor, um, I haven't been
feeling, um, well lately.

1:24:54.771 --> 1:24:56.873
Are you able to continue?

1:25:03.980 --> 1:25:05.480
Mm-hm.

1:25:06.749 --> 1:25:07.750
All right.

1:25:09.118 --> 1:25:10.485
One last time...

1:25:14.356 --> 1:25:16.759
state your name for the record.

1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:29.739
My name is David Martin,
reverend of the Town Church.

1:25:31.573 --> 1:25:32.875
Thank you, Reverend.

1:25:38.597 --> 1:25:40.015
Go with her.

1:25:41.583 --> 1:25:43.017
Now please tell the court

1:25:43.019 --> 1:25:44.954
what happened the night
you arrived in town.

1:25:48.623 --> 1:25:51.792
Well, uh, I parked
my van in front of the church

1:25:51.794 --> 1:25:55.062
and, um, and I met the...

1:25:56.398 --> 1:25:57.900
Hey, hey, stop!

1:26:01.469 --> 1:26:02.669
Poco!

1:26:02.671 --> 1:26:04.705
Get back! Stop!

1:26:04.707 --> 1:26:06.008
Get out of the way!

1:26:08.510 --> 1:26:10.947
- Poco!
- Stop! Stop!

1:26:14.416 --> 1:26:16.351
Hey, stop!

1:26:18.721 --> 1:26:19.956
I said stop!

1:26:44.512 --> 1:26:46.446
Chief, where'd he go?

1:26:46.448 --> 1:26:48.481
I don't know, in here somewhere.

1:26:48.483 --> 1:26:50.117
He might be heading
to the river.

1:26:50.119 --> 1:26:51.685
But he ain't leaving
without his brother.

1:26:51.687 --> 1:26:53.888
We must be sure
we find him first.

1:26:53.890 --> 1:26:56.056
You hear me?

1:26:56.058 --> 1:26:57.793
I'mma find your brother.

1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:00.029
I'll find him!

1:28:05.695 --> 1:28:07.029
Oh, shit.

1:28:07.930 --> 1:28:09.832
Oh, God.

1:28:28.284 --> 1:28:30.853
Celia, you in here?

1:33:20.843 --> 1:33:21.977
What?

1:33:22.978 --> 1:33:24.913
Tell me. What?

1:33:35.157 --> 1:33:39.428
What is your name?

1:33:43.599 --> 1:33:45.401
It doesn't matter.

1:33:49.138 --> 1:33:51.073
My name is Sinner.

1:33:57.379 --> 1:34:01.984
I murdered my wife...
and her lover.

1:34:02.885 --> 1:34:04.119
I caught them.

1:34:07.189 --> 1:34:10.025
I murdered David Martin...

1:34:11.593 --> 1:34:14.263
the body at the quarry,
you were right.

1:34:16.598 --> 1:34:18.334
I took everything from you.

1:34:24.139 --> 1:34:25.972
Please forgive me.

1:34:30.079 --> 1:34:33.115
Please forgive me.

1:34:37.486 --> 1:34:40.322
Please... Please forgive me,
forgive me.

1:34:41.423 --> 1:34:44.159
Forgive me, forgive me.

1:34:46.028 --> 1:34:48.097
Forgive me.

1:34:51.633 --> 1:34:53.369
Would you forgive me?

1:34:58.173 --> 1:34:59.641
Forgive me.

1:35:27.269 --> 1:35:30.005
I am not
the one who can forgive.

1:36:16.084 --> 1:36:17.519
<i>You ever think of leaving?</i>

1:36:19.555 --> 1:36:21.691
<i>What do you mean,
like running away?</i>

1:36:23.459 --> 1:36:27.396
Like making a new start,
leaving the past behind?

1:36:28.197 --> 1:36:29.496
Sure.

1:36:29.498 --> 1:36:32.401
Just catch a dream
bound for paradise.

1:36:34.470 --> 1:36:35.471
Why not?

1:36:40.884 --> 1:36:42.636
The past is always with you.

1:36:43.813 --> 1:36:45.280
What's that mean?
