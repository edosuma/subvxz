WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.959
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4 ...

00:06.500 --> 00:07.625
Aah!

00:07.709 --> 00:09.458
I will handle defense
until Harris gets back.

00:09.542 --> 00:10.625
(screaming)

00:10.709 --> 00:12.333
Veracity!

00:12.417 --> 00:15.458
-You saved me.
-And you saved us, so, thanks.

00:15.542 --> 00:16.458
And you're welcome.

00:16.542 --> 00:17.959
(roaring)

00:18.041 --> 00:20.041
Listen, your robot just got torn apart.

00:20.125 --> 00:22.250
Luckily, I can help you.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.250
Please!
You don't know what it can do.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.458
Do you know what I can do?

00:29.834 --> 00:32.166
(Ryan)
Guys, we made it! Grey's still here!

00:42.041 --> 00:43.166
-Oh...
-Uhh...

00:43.250 --> 00:44.166
-Right...
-Yeah.

00:44.250 --> 00:46.333
-I mean, if you--
-(laughs)

00:46.375 --> 00:47.709
Oh, this isn't awkward.

00:47.792 --> 00:49.375
I don't-- I don't feel awkward.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.959
No, no, no, this is your station,
your shields, so...

00:52.041 --> 00:53.417
I will go help Mark with the X-weapon.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.083
It's all good. It's all good. Okay.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.166
All right, Spyder? Light 'em up
like a Christmas tree.

01:11.792 --> 01:13.792
-Spyder?
-All my weapons just went dead.

01:17.333 --> 01:18.834
Uhh-- Uhh!

01:19.834 --> 01:20.667
So did shields.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.166
Mark! What's going on?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.917
You have no idea what you're doing!

01:25.000 --> 01:25.834
It used to be labeled.

01:25.917 --> 01:27.458
Hey, is everything okay?

01:27.542 --> 01:29.834
Leo and Harper were trying
to shift power to the X-weapon,

01:29.917 --> 01:32.083
but then they started
clawing each other's eyes out.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.333
-That's not how you route power!
-Uh, yeah, it is,

01:34.417 --> 01:36.041
haven't you heard of neutron flow?

01:36.125 --> 01:37.875
I invented neutron flow, baby!

01:37.959 --> 01:40.041
Yeah! Both the power relay
and the colon cleanse.

01:40.125 --> 01:43.250
Guys! Stop arguing and start fixing!

01:43.917 --> 01:48.166
(grunts) This is gonna be
a very short fight!

01:50.959 --> 01:53.959
(theme music playing)

02:25.875 --> 02:27.709
(roaring)

02:27.792 --> 02:29.250
Aah!

02:45.458 --> 02:46.542
(Harris) What happened?

02:46.625 --> 02:48.291
Are we dead?

02:48.375 --> 02:50.458
And the afterlife looks
just like normal life?

02:50.542 --> 02:52.792
What if I've been dead for years
and I just didn't know it?

02:53.375 --> 02:56.041
You know, it just left.
It didn't care about us.

02:56.125 --> 02:59.291
(growling)

03:01.291 --> 03:03.041
(sirens blaring)

03:03.125 --> 03:05.125
Why would it just stomp
on the third-best

03:05.208 --> 03:07.166
research institute
in the Bay City area and leave?

03:07.250 --> 03:10.458
(sirens continue)

03:10.542 --> 03:13.250
-Your design has flaws!
-Well, your sweater has flaws!

03:13.333 --> 03:15.417
Well, what are those goggles
even doing?

03:15.500 --> 03:18.417
(all yelling at once)

03:18.500 --> 03:20.375
Guys! Guys!
Hey, Leo, what happened?

03:20.458 --> 03:21.750
Robot just stopped moving!

03:21.834 --> 03:24.083
-First of all, these goggles are sweet.
-Ehh...

03:24.166 --> 03:26.750
Second of all,
when the robot got put back together,

03:26.834 --> 03:30.041
somebody whose name
begins with an "H"...

03:31.000 --> 03:32.834
didn't use the right wiring protocol.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.208
Yeah, Harris!

03:34.291 --> 03:37.542
-Seriously?
-Guys, can you just figure it out?

03:37.625 --> 03:39.917
Before Traeger
throws another monster at us?

03:42.125 --> 03:43.000
Please!

03:43.834 --> 03:47.041
-Fine, fine.
-Okay. Shake hands.

03:47.667 --> 03:49.166
-Oh...
-Come on!

03:49.250 --> 03:50.542
Ugh!

03:56.083 --> 03:58.208
All right, now go fix
the robot together.

03:58.291 --> 04:01.166
(both arguing)

04:04.166 --> 04:06.625
We're just lucky the monster
wasn't targeting us this time.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.041
(Ryan)
Yeah, but what was it doing?

04:08.125 --> 04:11.250
It didn't even destroy the place,
it just put a hole in the roof.

04:11.333 --> 04:14.500
Uh, all right, once the authorities clear
out we can go check it out.

04:15.375 --> 04:18.000
Yeah. I'll pick you up around seven.

04:19.125 --> 04:22.000
Uh... Yeah. Miss you, too.

04:22.083 --> 04:25.000
Ha-ha, look at Mark Walker,
gettin' all serious.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.875
-I'm not gettin' serious.
-Uh-huh.

04:26.959 --> 04:29.667
Maybe a little serious,
but... the good news is,

04:29.750 --> 04:32.125
we can take our time, because...

04:34.291 --> 04:35.500
What's going on?

04:38.959 --> 04:40.166
But why leave Bay City?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.250
That monster attack
was the last straw.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.625
What if he had stomped
our house while you guys were home?

04:44.709 --> 04:45.959
Oregano.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.458
No, the monsters
aren't targeting civilians, they--

04:48.542 --> 04:52.333
-(coughing)
-Uh, said so... on the news.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.291
Yeah, and Mech-X4 is protecting us.

04:54.375 --> 04:57.375
(laughs) I'm sorry if I don't trust
a robot who blew up

04:57.458 --> 04:59.834
your old school
to not smash our house

04:59.917 --> 05:02.375
the next time he gets into a fight.
Carrots.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.208
What about our friends?

05:06.291 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, Mark finally
has a girlfriend that he talks with

05:09.083 --> 05:11.917
-instead of just pretending to listen to.
-Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.875
(sighs) Boys, I know it's gonna be
hard for you to leave Bay City,

05:14.959 --> 05:16.333
but... it's for the best.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.417
(food processor running)

05:19.667 --> 05:25.125
Okay. (sighs) I got a final audition
with Chrstph Frssll

05:25.208 --> 05:27.375
at the Bay City Culinary Institute.

05:27.458 --> 05:31.542
-(laugh) I'm sorry, who?
-Chrstph Frssll, the famous chef?

05:31.625 --> 05:35.959
He removed all the vowels
from his name in an artistic statement.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.667
Anyways, if I can impress him,

05:37.750 --> 05:40.417
I will be an assistant chef
at his flagship restaurant

05:40.500 --> 05:42.458
-in Miami.
-Wait, what? Miami?

05:42.542 --> 05:44.667
-I know, can you believe it? Black pepper.
-But Mom--

05:44.750 --> 05:47.417
I said... black pepper.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.750
See, if I can get this job,

05:57.834 --> 06:02.333
I'll be able to move you guys
away... and no more danger,

06:02.417 --> 06:05.917
no more monsters... no more Mech-X4.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.834
Hmm?

06:12.166 --> 06:14.959
Okay, Leo, I brought
the electrocillator for you.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.041
Not that you'd even know
what to do with it.

06:18.125 --> 06:18.959
Leo?

06:20.250 --> 06:22.000
Where are you, weirdo?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.250
Leo... Leo?

06:26.792 --> 06:27.959
Oh--

06:31.000 --> 06:36.291
Yeah... Ahh... pretty sure that's
what it's used for.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.041
And you're the weirdo.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.375
How are we supposed
to fight monsters from Miami?

06:42.458 --> 06:43.959
I don't know, with jet packs.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.500
We can't.
The team needs to be together.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.917
I promise... we'll stay in touch.

06:50.625 --> 06:51.667
Talk to you later.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.291
-Georgia?
-Dane.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.000
-Oh.
-There's no other way around this, Ryan.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.500
If you move,
Mech-X4 will basically be useless.

06:59.583 --> 07:02.041
-Mm.
-Which means there's one thing left to do.

07:04.166 --> 07:05.166
Wreck her audition?

07:05.250 --> 07:06.875
What other choice do we have?

07:06.959 --> 07:08.166
(phone beeps)

07:08.250 --> 07:10.250
Oh. Veracity says that
the authorities

07:10.333 --> 07:12.250
have cleared out
of the Institute. We should go.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.333
All right. Which will leave you two...

07:14.417 --> 07:16.250
to wreck your mom's career.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.583
Up top!

07:19.709 --> 07:20.959
Hm...

07:25.125 --> 07:27.125
All right, welcome
to your audition.

07:27.750 --> 07:28.959
(clears throat)

07:30.625 --> 07:34.750
Now, confidentially,
it's between you, and well...

07:35.417 --> 07:37.500
one other person. Okay?

07:38.542 --> 07:39.834
-Back.
-Oh.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.250
The only reason I'm telling you
that is 'cause I want to see

07:42.333 --> 07:44.917
how you... work...
under pressure, yeah?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.625
I-- I-- I know this is a huge opportunity
and I'm just-- I'm so grateful.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.542
You should be terrified.

07:50.625 --> 07:54.917
Now! I have a... philosophy.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.041
Complete my thought!

07:56.125 --> 07:58.291
(Grace) Oh-- Uh-- Uh--
Cuisine is not just food,

07:58.375 --> 08:00.750
it's a statement
of originality and simplicity.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.125
We're really gonna pull off
an epic jerk maneuver?

08:03.208 --> 08:07.375
I guess... to save the world
we have to destroy Mom's tryout.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.291
All right, let's see
what you come up with... okay?

08:10.375 --> 08:14.208
Now, for the audition,
you're gonna cook your best entree.

08:14.834 --> 08:18.917
-Laying your very (sniffs) essence...
-Yes?

08:19.000 --> 08:19.875
on the plate.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.166
Right.

08:21.875 --> 08:25.125
All right, come on. Tick tock, chop chop.
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, let's go.

08:25.709 --> 08:28.125
-We gotta distract her.
-I'll call her.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.625
Okay.

08:30.291 --> 08:31.333
Okay.

08:31.417 --> 08:32.834
-(phone ringing)
-Oh.

08:33.667 --> 08:34.917
(phone ringing)

08:35.542 --> 08:37.500
Mark, I'm kinda busy right now.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.291
Mom, um, there's...

08:41.208 --> 08:43.208
no ducks at the duck pond.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.917
Mark, since when
do you care about ducks?

08:46.792 --> 08:49.500
Uh-- No-- Oh, no, now there's
too many ducks!

08:49.583 --> 08:51.000
A little extra heat...

08:53.250 --> 08:55.667
-Oh!
-Okay, what's going on?

08:55.750 --> 08:57.458
Everything's fine. Bye.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.125
What?

09:00.625 --> 09:02.250
Oh! (gasps)

09:03.625 --> 09:04.667
Ohh...

09:07.125 --> 09:09.125
-(food processor turns on)
-(screams)

09:16.500 --> 09:18.250
Oh, no!

09:19.542 --> 09:20.375
Ohh...

09:21.583 --> 09:22.417
(gasps)

09:24.959 --> 09:26.250
(exhales)

09:38.250 --> 09:40.959
Harper was involved
with this place? Not good.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.542
Uh, I'm gonna go
check this place out.

09:46.625 --> 09:47.583
I'll be back.

09:50.834 --> 09:51.792
That's weird.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.500
This is from a triassic muscipula.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.125
Some of these plants
went extinct with the dinosaurs.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.125
The Institute must be
trying to bring them back.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.291
Oh, wow, a leaf. Uh, don't eat 'em,
don't care about 'em.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.417
-Hey!
-"Destroy the Grub Buggy"?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.542
"Waste Chrstph Frssll"?

10:09.625 --> 10:10.750
What is this?

10:10.834 --> 10:13.083
It's, uh, it's a way
to get Ryan and Mark to stay

10:13.166 --> 10:14.250
if their plan doesn't work.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.333
"Frame Ms. Walker
for a crime I committed"?

10:16.417 --> 10:19.250
Oh, I was just, uh, I was
thinking a victimless crime,

10:19.333 --> 10:21.875
like something a smart lady
would commit, like, uh...

10:21.959 --> 10:23.125
like predatory lending.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.125
Okay, what is going on with you?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.291
I, um...

10:28.875 --> 10:29.750
I...

10:30.417 --> 10:32.709
I just don't want Ryan to leave.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.792
Hey, Spyder, come on.

10:35.875 --> 10:38.500
Even if he does, we'll figure out a way
to stop the monsters.

10:38.583 --> 10:41.208
I don't care about that.
I care about us splitting up.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.583
I mean, will you even
hang out with me if Ryan's gone?

10:43.667 --> 10:44.834
Ryan's the glue of the group.

10:44.917 --> 10:47.166
That's crazy. We'll always be friends.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.458
People change, Harris.

10:50.458 --> 10:53.500
Leo and Harper used to be friends...
look at them now.

10:54.750 --> 10:55.583
Oh.

10:58.041 --> 11:00.208
(groaning)

11:02.750 --> 11:03.583
Wait...

11:06.291 --> 11:07.834
What are you doing?

11:09.000 --> 11:11.333
You and I are gonna have
an honest chat.

11:11.417 --> 11:14.000
Couple college buddies
catchin' up.

11:14.083 --> 11:14.959
Hm-hm, mm?

11:15.041 --> 11:16.834
Hm... okay.

11:16.917 --> 11:19.166
I see what you're doin'.
You're gonna... waste me.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.834
Unless I tell you
what my secret evil plan is.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.875
Well, there isn't one.

11:23.959 --> 11:27.709
Okay? I made a deal with Ryan,
I am trying to help.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.041
Mmm!

11:31.583 --> 11:33.333
And I'm trying to get you
to stop talking,

11:33.417 --> 11:36.333
so you realize it's time
for you to leave.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.875
I know what's really going on.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.417
You're afraid I'll tell them
the truth about you.

11:41.917 --> 11:46.166
That you helped me...
make... the monsters.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.959
What? Plot twist!

11:51.750 --> 11:53.375
Arm twist!

11:53.458 --> 11:57.166
(grunting)

12:03.333 --> 12:07.125
Ten, nine, and time's up
because I said so.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.000
All right, let's have a taste.

12:09.667 --> 12:11.875
-You look nervous.
-I am.

12:11.959 --> 12:15.500
Well, you should be,
because this...

12:15.583 --> 12:17.417
is the opportunity of a lifetime.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.083
It's all for a good cause.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.375
I keep telling myself that.

12:28.625 --> 12:31.709
(coughing)

12:31.792 --> 12:37.000
(coughing continues)

12:37.083 --> 12:40.291
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

12:41.083 --> 12:41.917
Oh!

12:43.417 --> 12:45.959
This is genius!

12:47.291 --> 12:48.166
Really?

12:48.250 --> 12:51.333
Uhh-- I was worried the quail was
overcooked and the chutney was too thin.

12:51.417 --> 12:54.375
You changed the chemical composition
of the caramelization

12:54.458 --> 12:57.667
in such a way that I have never,
ever tasted before,

12:57.750 --> 13:02.959
and-- mmm-- the way that you pureed
the chutney so fine

13:03.041 --> 13:04.875
hints at an anger at life.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.625
We made her food better?

13:07.709 --> 13:09.291
And our lives worse.

13:15.583 --> 13:17.375
(birds singing)

13:20.417 --> 13:22.834
Hey, look... this one's dead.

13:22.917 --> 13:26.333
Shattered, broken, dead.

13:26.417 --> 13:29.458
This whole day is a metaphor
for what's happening to the team.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.834
Where'd you learn
the word "metaphor"?

13:31.917 --> 13:35.041
Veracity sometimes reads to me
from the "thess-a-russ."

13:36.417 --> 13:37.875
(Veracity screaming)

13:37.959 --> 13:42.417
Aahh! Ah! Guys! I can't move!

13:42.500 --> 13:44.125
Uh-- Don't worry, we'll get it off.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.041
It'll be fine, just stay still.

13:46.125 --> 13:49.834
Aah! (screaming)

13:53.375 --> 13:56.208
Ah! Ah!

13:57.291 --> 13:59.709
Aah! Ahh!

14:00.583 --> 14:02.250
Dude, her vitals are dropping!

14:02.333 --> 14:04.625
If we don't get this thing off,
we're gonna lose her!

14:04.709 --> 14:06.792
This plant is clearly dangerous.

14:06.875 --> 14:09.208
There's gotta be something
nearby we can use to kill it.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.166
See that tank? That must be the herbicide
they use to control the plant's growth.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.333
That stuff
can get this thing off Veracity?

14:16.417 --> 14:19.792
Yeah, but... I don't know
what the herbicide would do to her.

14:20.750 --> 14:22.542
What are you doing?

14:27.750 --> 14:29.834
-Spyder, that's not body spray!
-Aah!

14:31.750 --> 14:34.667
Dude, we both know my future career is
going to be "test subject."

14:34.750 --> 14:35.917
That career starts today.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.542
We don't know if that's safe!

14:37.625 --> 14:39.000
Uh! Uh!

14:39.083 --> 14:40.875
Safe?
Since when do I care about safe?

14:40.959 --> 14:43.750
I mean my safe.
I care about your safe.

14:43.834 --> 14:44.959
Aah!

14:45.041 --> 14:45.875
Aah!

14:48.750 --> 14:50.917
Nothing bubbling.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.250
Not blind.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.083
Uh, tingles a little, but I'm good.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.709
I think it's safe.

15:01.709 --> 15:02.917
Aah!

15:06.083 --> 15:07.125
(Harris) It's working!

15:10.792 --> 15:11.750
Oh.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.375
I feel funny.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.208
Who wants nachos?

15:18.917 --> 15:20.083
Let's get nachos.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.959
It must've released some spores
into her bloodstream.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.375
Just enough to make her loopy.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.250
Do you know who I think
is really cute?

15:28.917 --> 15:29.917
Puppies.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.709
(laughing)

15:35.875 --> 15:37.333
You risked your life to save her.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.250
What does that say to you?

15:39.333 --> 15:42.208
I don't have a very strong
survival instinct?

15:43.542 --> 15:44.792
Don't you get it?

15:44.875 --> 15:47.500
You're willing to do anything
to protect your friends.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.834
Ryan isn't the glue... you are.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.250
I'm the glue.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.250
I'm the glue.

15:56.542 --> 15:57.875
You guys gonna go to prom?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.166
-You gonna get a limo?
-Uh-huh.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.709
We should get you
back to the robot.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.041
Can we get nachos first?

16:05.709 --> 16:07.458
-Yes.
-Yes!

16:07.542 --> 16:08.959
All right, let's go.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.458
(Leo)
We were gonna scare people...

16:12.542 --> 16:14.792
give mankind an enemy
to unite against.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.583
I thought we were
bringing people together.

16:16.667 --> 16:20.500
Yeah, but will the team
see it that way?

16:20.583 --> 16:22.375
That's what you're worried about.

16:22.458 --> 16:26.583
Look, Leo...
I'm good at keeping secrets.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.125
I'll keep this one, too,
and deep down,

16:29.208 --> 16:31.417
you know you can't beat Traeger
without me.

16:39.709 --> 16:40.917
So you won't tell the team?

16:41.959 --> 16:43.834
I can keep this quiet.

16:46.000 --> 16:46.959
We good?

16:47.875 --> 16:48.917
Yeah.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.750
Good!
'Cause this was getting boring.

16:50.834 --> 16:53.208
Password, amazing grace.

16:53.291 --> 16:54.458
(electrical burst)

16:56.417 --> 16:58.166
You coulda got out
anytime you wanted?

16:58.250 --> 17:00.625
Yeah, I kinda been locked up
twice this year,

17:00.709 --> 17:02.208
so I programmed voice commands

17:02.291 --> 17:04.917
into basically anything
that could capture me.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.375
Come on, Leopold,
let's fix this robot.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.083
I don't like it
when people call me Leopold.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.125
That's why I do it.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.166
-Then stop doing it.
-But it's so fun.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.625
(beeping)

17:21.375 --> 17:23.875
Is your final dish ready?

17:23.959 --> 17:26.000
The custard meringue... almost.

17:26.083 --> 17:26.917
Hm.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.125
This is our last chance.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.917
You gotta blow out the broiler.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.834
-(clears throat)
-You know, my therapist says

17:34.917 --> 17:38.959
that I should pretend to care
more, so... (sighs)

17:41.458 --> 17:45.000
why are you so keen on moving?

17:45.083 --> 17:47.583
(Grace) Uh, well, honestly,
a big part of it is

17:47.667 --> 17:51.417
being able to move my kids
away from all the monsters and robots.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.208
But it's also my dream.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.792
I've been working for this
my whole life.

17:57.875 --> 17:58.709
(Chrstph) Hm.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.583
I don't know, man.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.083
We thought she was
trying to protect us, but--

18:09.166 --> 18:10.208
She said it's her dream.

18:11.625 --> 18:13.291
-If we do this--
-We can't.

18:19.458 --> 18:21.333
Right... well, let's have a taste.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.542
Yes, okay. Okay.

18:35.917 --> 18:39.041
Oh, oh, oh! Perfect!

18:39.125 --> 18:40.458
I'll see you in Miami.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.250
I've got a date
with a Yorkshire pudding.

18:45.125 --> 18:48.667
(singsongy) What? Miami!

18:48.750 --> 18:51.375
Great... now we have
to leave Bay City.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.500
There is another way.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.041
You know what we have to do.

19:11.625 --> 19:12.917
Firing's all fixed.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.166
Power's back to normal.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.125
And... better than new.

19:16.208 --> 19:17.667
-Mm.
-Thank you very much.

19:17.750 --> 19:20.542
Are you-- Are you two friends now?

19:20.625 --> 19:22.959
Not-- Not exactly... friends.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.792
But... not exactly enemies, either.

19:26.875 --> 19:27.875
(Harper) Hm.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.333
-I don't think--
-Come on!

19:31.834 --> 19:33.917
-You know you want to.
-All right, once.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.709
-Science. Yay.
-Science. Still got it.

19:36.792 --> 19:38.000
Nacho?

19:38.083 --> 19:40.500
I'm good, I don't do... carbs.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.250
There we go.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.166
(Leo) Carbs, carbs, carbs. It's like,
have a carb, enjoy your life.

19:45.875 --> 19:49.291
Ryan? Mark? I've got great news.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.250
-You got the job?
-Yes! (laughs)

19:51.333 --> 19:53.625
We knew you would.
You're awesome.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.000
Oh, you guys, come here.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.125
(laughs)

19:57.208 --> 19:59.375
Okay, so, um, two weeks to pack,

19:59.458 --> 20:03.834
and oh, you are gonna love the beach,
it is so beautiful down there.

20:03.917 --> 20:05.542
-Mom?
-Oh, I'm just so excited!

20:05.625 --> 20:07.166
Mom!

20:16.709 --> 20:17.875
That's weird.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.709
Th-- That's just like my audition.

20:22.667 --> 20:23.667
Yeah, that's me.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.625
What?

20:26.709 --> 20:30.166
There's something that--
that we need to tell you.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.667
He has a power.

20:35.041 --> 20:38.000
I can control machines
with my mind.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.875
And it's not just blenders.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.000
It's a giant robot, too.

20:47.709 --> 20:50.750
I'm the pilot of Mech-X4.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.792
What?

21:08.583 --> 21:11.792
(grunting)

21:17.291 --> 21:18.709
I could only get this one.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.083
This is a start.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.083
So tell me...

21:27.000 --> 21:28.625
how did it feel?

21:28.709 --> 21:31.417
To have the power
to be a giant monster?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.583
Amazing.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.000
Amazing. This is what you found
at the facility?

21:38.083 --> 21:40.667
Yeah. And one of 'em tried
to eat Veracity's face.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.709
Yeah, but, what does Traeger
want with them?

21:45.375 --> 21:46.875
So what's next?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.250
Next, we make one of these

21:50.333 --> 21:52.625
for every man, woman, and child
on the Earth.

21:52.709 --> 21:55.667
Starting... with my brother.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.917
(theme music playing)
