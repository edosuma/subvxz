08:53.191 --> 08:54.233
Hello.

08:55.608 --> 09:00.608
Hello, I reserved a room for
Sophie Baroud for one night.

09:18.941 --> 09:21.107
- Your room key.
- Thanks very much.

09:21.191 --> 09:23.607
- Have a good day, miss.
- You too. Goodbye.

09:23.691 --> 09:24.858
Goodbye.

09:25.691 --> 09:31.858
- Hello, miss. - Hi, I reserved a room
for Sophie Baroud for one night.

14:06.233 --> 14:10.817
- Hello. I have a meeting here
with the minister. - Yes.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.317
- Ask at the reception.
- Thanks.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.691
What's up?

15:02.858 --> 15:04.942
It's not fucking working.

15:05.450 --> 15:06.732
Try more slowly.

15:06.816 --> 15:08.733
It's not working, okay?

15:30.941 --> 15:32.399
It's Fred, on door 4.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.899
Can you release N7?

15:33.983 --> 15:37.316
It's a delivery for the studio.
Lock it again later.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.524
- It stays unlocked?
- Yeah, leave it for now.

15:40.608 --> 15:43.399
- Keep an eye out.
- No sweat. Over and out.

15:43.483 --> 15:44.900
Message received.

15:56.108 --> 16:00.692
- May I have your credit card, please?
- Yes, of course.

16:04.066 --> 16:05.108
Thank you.

16:13.483 --> 16:14.525
Here you go.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.607
- Is there a problem?
- Not at all.

16:26.691 --> 16:28.275
I'll be right back.

16:47.983 --> 16:50.900
Sorry, will you pay with this card?

16:51.108 --> 16:55.275
- Uh, no, with cash.
- You haven't signed the back.

18:34.983 --> 18:38.900
FLOOR UNDER RENOVATION
NOT SERVICED BY ELEVATORS

18:50.400 --> 18:52.734
Go on. I'll take the stairs.

19:30.525 --> 19:32.025
Fuck, you're slow.

19:38.191 --> 19:40.441
- This is for David.
- Okay.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.775
- Hello.
- Hello.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.149
- Mr. Devaux? Your appointment's
at 3:30? - Yes.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.483
- Come with me.
- Thank you.

21:56.150 --> 21:58.774
How are things going at Sciences Po?

21:58.858 --> 22:00.691
Very well, nice and smooth.

22:00.775 --> 22:03.941
I'm aiming for the ENA in two years.

22:04.233 --> 22:05.483
Very good.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.482
So what are you studying now?

22:07.566 --> 22:09.233
Civil service law.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.441
Ouch.

22:10.608 --> 22:13.442
It's okay, it's not too difficult.

22:15.816 --> 22:17.482
Who's your professor?

22:17.566 --> 22:21.483
- Jean-Bernard Auby.
- Ah, an excellent teacher.

22:22.025 --> 22:24.024
- Been here before?
- Yes, twice.

22:24.108 --> 22:28.858
I won't show you around then.
And how's your father doing?

23:51.733 --> 23:54.733
Where R U?

24:01.400 --> 24:04.065
the bench
on the square

24:11.983 --> 24:14.900
- Lookin' for me? - Yeah,
mom wants you. - Yeah? Why?

24:15.066 --> 24:17.065
She went through your stuff.

24:17.149 --> 24:20.816
I think she found something on your
laptop. She was yelling and crying.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.649
- She was crying?
- Crying and hitting the wall.

24:23.733 --> 24:26.233
She can't go through my stuff!

24:26.816 --> 24:29.982
- What's on the computer?
- Just shit for school.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.149
- Come on, what is it?
- Nothing.

24:32.233 --> 24:35.817
- Tell me.
- I'll go over and then we split.

24:38.483 --> 24:40.648
- Wanna sing for us, Yacine?
- Not now.

24:40.732 --> 24:44.024
- Please, come on.
- No. I'm not some clown, okay?

24:44.108 --> 24:45.608
He's not a clown.

24:47.316 --> 24:49.150
I'm gone in an hour.

24:49.316 --> 24:50.774
I'm working later.

24:50.858 --> 24:53.441
If they don't see me by then,
I'll split.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.275
You're fucking crazy.

24:56.400 --> 25:00.733
In a job like this,
you'll be bored shitless.

25:01.008 --> 25:02.707
A parking garage all night...

25:02.791 --> 25:08.274
It's okay, I don't care. It's better
than having a boss always on my back.

25:08.358 --> 25:11.358
- How many will they take?
- No idea.

25:12.941 --> 25:14.774
Both looking for work?

25:14.858 --> 25:17.108
No, just him. I have a job.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.233
Been looking long?

25:21.400 --> 25:23.108
Yeah, a year or so.

25:23.275 --> 25:25.400
A year? Bummer...

25:25.691 --> 25:28.149
- But you're really looking?
- Yeah, I'm looking.

25:28.233 --> 25:30.649
I look every day,
but there's nothing.

25:30.733 --> 25:32.691
How about you? How long?

25:32.775 --> 25:34.192
No, not too long.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.734
Do they hire you right away?

25:37.983 --> 25:39.317
Not usually, no.

25:39.733 --> 25:42.150
But they'll call you soon.

25:44.441 --> 25:45.941
Done this before?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.317
No, it's my first time.

25:50.691 --> 25:52.483
- And you?
- No.

25:54.816 --> 25:56.441
What do you do?

25:56.608 --> 25:58.525
I work in a restaurant.

26:13.483 --> 26:17.567
Creating Jobs
in small and average sized companies

26:19.150 --> 26:23.400
HSBC tightens its belt
with close to 50,000 lay-offs

26:35.316 --> 26:36.566
Hello, sir.

26:36.733 --> 26:39.524
- Hello. - Do you have 
an account here? - Yes.

26:39.608 --> 26:43.232
- May I have the account number?
- I don't know it by heart.

26:43.316 --> 26:45.650
I'm here to deposit a check.

26:51.108 --> 26:54.357
Can you hold up a piece of ID
to the camera, please?

26:54.441 --> 26:58.066
Sorry, I don't have my ID on me.
But my account's here.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.775
Your name, please.

26:59.941 --> 27:00.941
Devaux.

27:01.108 --> 27:03.441
- Your first name?
- André.

27:03.608 --> 27:05.441
Your date of birth?

27:05.608 --> 27:07.566
September 17, 1992.

27:07.732 --> 27:09.316
Your address?

27:09.483 --> 27:11.525
64, Rue du Bac, but...

27:11.691 --> 27:13.857
Hurry, I'm claustrophobic.

27:13.941 --> 27:15.441
Can I come in?

27:15.608 --> 27:18.692
Sorry, we have new security measures.

27:25.858 --> 27:28.524
"The situation recalls Chile
in the 70s

27:28.608 --> 27:31.816
"when Nixon was attempting
to overthrow Allende

27:31.900 --> 27:35.441
"to prevent similar movements
in the USA's backyard.

27:35.525 --> 27:37.691
"Make the economy scream,"
Nixon ordered.

27:37.775 --> 27:40.524
"Afterwards, Pinochet's tanks took over.

27:40.608 --> 27:43.816
"The silent coup in Greece
used more modern tools."

27:43.900 --> 27:45.316
Will you help me?

27:45.400 --> 27:46.734
Yeah, of course.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.275
It's all there.

27:49.441 --> 27:51.816
All of last year's subjects.

27:52.483 --> 27:56.191
In history, you have an essay
to do in four hours.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.316
Subjects on the 20th century.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.982
Last year, you had...

28:00.066 --> 28:04.574
"Economic growth, globalization
and social changes since 1850,"

28:04.658 --> 28:06.849
"War and totalitarianism
since 1900,"

28:06.933 --> 28:10.524
and "The stakes facing France
at the turn of the century."

28:10.608 --> 28:11.974
Which one did you do?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.606
Totalitarianism.
I'd only revised that.

28:14.690 --> 28:17.149
Always stick to the same plan.

28:17.233 --> 28:21.066
In part A, expose the problem
and define it.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.733
In B, explain it.

28:22.900 --> 28:28.066
In part C, take it to its paroxysm
to define the limits.

28:28.233 --> 28:30.316
And in D, suggest a solution.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.357
You can add a risky theory, too.

28:32.441 --> 28:35.024
Something politically incorrect,
or even unacceptable.

28:35.108 --> 28:36.899
Even if they don't like it.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.816
They'll want you to fuel the debate.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.650
What was your theory?

28:42.150 --> 28:45.116
I ended saying
the 20th century was proof

28:45.183 --> 28:48.316
that so-called perfect democracy
becomes its own enemy.

28:48.400 --> 28:51.932
It can only be judged by its enemies,
not its results because...

28:52.016 --> 28:54.957
the results brought us to
the end of civilization.

28:55.047 --> 28:56.851
I don't understand a word.

28:56.941 --> 29:02.316
Going further, civilization is a condition
for the downfall of civilization.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.149
I won't take the exam.

29:04.233 --> 29:05.817
Why not? It's cool.

29:06.066 --> 29:07.108
Cool?

29:07.816 --> 29:11.191
Be honest...
this place kills thinking.

29:11.608 --> 29:13.857
You can think in political schools.

29:13.941 --> 29:16.357
We'll both end up like our fathers.

29:16.441 --> 29:17.775
They're alike?

29:17.941 --> 29:18.775
You bet.

29:18.941 --> 29:20.608
And I'm like mine?

29:20.816 --> 29:22.941
You've never attended a class.

29:23.025 --> 29:25.107
- This is true.
- Here you go.

29:25.191 --> 29:26.400
Thanks.

29:26.566 --> 29:28.650
- Thanks, Yacine.
- Enjoy.

29:32.150 --> 29:33.608
Enjoy.

29:41.025 --> 29:44.359
Historically,
what comes after decadence?

29:44.733 --> 29:45.900
Rebirth?

29:46.108 --> 29:49.358
And when rebirth is death,
what happens?

29:50.816 --> 29:51.858
Hi.

29:54.108 --> 29:55.566
David... André.

29:55.733 --> 29:56.941
Hello.

29:57.566 --> 29:58.982
He's doing the exam too.

29:59.066 --> 30:00.400
Want a drink?

30:00.566 --> 30:01.775
I'm okay.

30:03.191 --> 30:06.858
- Live nearby?
- No, I live in Aubervilliers.

30:07.191 --> 30:08.233
Ah, okay...

30:10.108 --> 30:15.149
Everyone thinks the Bastille column
was made for the 1789 revolution.

30:15.233 --> 30:17.399
But it wasn't built until 1830.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.566
Oh yeah?

30:19.191 --> 30:20.233
Yeah, look.

30:21.275 --> 30:25.649
"The golden statue at the top
represents Liberty personified.

30:25.733 --> 30:28.482
"On July 27th, 28th and 29th, 1830,"

30:28.566 --> 30:31.149
"Paris rose up and overthrew Charles X.

30:31.233 --> 30:34.899
"Later that year,
the government decided to build

30:34.983 --> 30:38.482
"a bronze memorial to the victims
of the Three Days.

30:38.566 --> 30:42.774
"The inauguration saw
the solemn transfer of the remains.

30:42.858 --> 30:45.816
"Berlioz wrote music for the event.

30:45.983 --> 30:49.899
"His 'Funeral and Triumphal Symphony'
was played on the boulevards of Paris,

30:49.983 --> 30:51.649
"with Berlioz conducting.

30:51.733 --> 30:57.317
"He led the parade of musicians
that ended on Place de la Bastille."

31:33.733 --> 31:35.649
You like kissing me there?

31:35.733 --> 31:36.858
Yes.

33:58.275 --> 34:01.691
- Good luck. All my best to your father.
- Thanks.

34:01.775 --> 34:04.798
See you soon, maybe
here for your internship.

34:04.882 --> 34:07.133
Thank you. Have a good day.

36:03.191 --> 36:04.525
Don't answer it.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.066
Don't answer it!

36:06.150 --> 36:08.858
unknown number

36:58.400 --> 37:00.817
I'll do this floor,
you do 29.

37:01.066 --> 37:02.358
Hold on.

37:03.858 --> 37:05.774
- We stay together.
- No.

37:05.858 --> 37:07.774
We said the 28th and 29th floor.

37:07.858 --> 37:08.941
Go on up.

37:09.108 --> 37:09.941
Go up!

37:49.483 --> 37:50.525
Sarah!

39:45.066 --> 39:46.483
What's it called?

39:46.941 --> 39:48.358
This is Semtex.

39:48.816 --> 39:52.025
Developed in the 1960s
in Yugoslavia.

39:52.816 --> 39:54.650
It's not made anymore.

39:55.150 --> 39:58.024
There are 40,000 tons left
around the world.

39:58.108 --> 40:01.024
Keep it carefully
and it'll last years.

40:01.108 --> 40:03.025
They did that in Libya.

40:03.191 --> 40:04.775
Where's this from?

40:05.650 --> 40:07.066
This was stolen

40:07.233 --> 40:10.566
from a civil security site
just outside Lyons.

40:10.650 --> 40:12.566
30 kilos stolen.

40:12.858 --> 40:14.483
How much is here?

40:14.775 --> 40:16.858
Around 250 grams.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.400
I got 4 kilos total.

40:20.025 --> 40:23.775
But 250 grams is enough
to destroy a jetliner.

40:27.858 --> 40:28.942
Are you okay?

40:29.066 --> 40:29.983
Yeah.

40:31.233 --> 40:32.775
Have some vodka.

40:38.775 --> 40:42.357
Can I crash here tonight?
Otherwise I have to go to Saint-Denis.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.650
No worries.

41:01.025 --> 41:02.608
Sign it.

41:03.608 --> 41:06.775
It's a swipe, you don't need a PIN.

41:06.941 --> 41:09.407
It's to secure the room.
Pay cash.

41:09.491 --> 41:11.232
It'll be 3 or 400 hundred euros.

41:11.316 --> 41:14.066
400 euros? Per night?
Fuck, that's expensive!

41:14.150 --> 41:14.983
Yeah.

41:15.150 --> 41:17.150
I could buy other stuff.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.025
Relax, I'm kidding.

41:20.191 --> 41:23.149
- And the cherry-picker?
- Greg'll bring it.

41:23.233 --> 41:24.275
Around 3:30.

41:24.441 --> 41:27.275
It'll be there when she comes out.

41:28.733 --> 41:30.983
Take the red. Take the red!

41:33.983 --> 41:35.066
You're dead.

41:39.566 --> 41:42.649
What do we do with the leftover Semtex?

41:42.733 --> 41:45.232
Omar hides it in the storeroom.

41:45.316 --> 41:48.733
We can get to it
if things are screwed up.

41:55.025 --> 41:57.607
- What time do we meet?
- Just after.

41:57.691 --> 41:59.858
At 7 o'clock. 7PM.

42:00.025 --> 42:01.566
No calls.

42:01.733 --> 42:04.232
You all dump your phone, okay?

42:04.316 --> 42:06.316
We meet up at the store.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.691
It's still open at 7.

42:09.107 --> 42:11.107
We blend into the crowd.

42:14.858 --> 42:15.900
Go on.

42:16.608 --> 42:18.525
Hello. I've reserved...

42:18.733 --> 42:22.066
Hello, I've reserved a room
for Sophie Baroud.

42:22.150 --> 42:26.067
No, too stressed.
Say it more calmly and simply.

42:26.233 --> 42:29.733
Step back, then walk up to me.
Do it again.

42:32.858 --> 42:35.732
Hello, I've reserved a room
for Sophie Baroud.

42:35.816 --> 42:39.507
Again. Say it like you've repeated it
ten times at home.

42:39.591 --> 42:40.707
It's no good?

42:40.791 --> 42:45.025
No. Look me in the eye,
like you're used to doing it.

42:45.441 --> 42:47.607
It's the safest place going.

42:47.691 --> 42:50.857
It's too dangerous going home.
If we're identified...

42:50.941 --> 42:53.149
It's unlikely, but you never know.

42:53.233 --> 42:58.441
If it goes well, we head home at 6AM.
Omar will handle security and the alarm.

42:58.525 --> 43:01.066
- How?
- It's dead simple.

43:01.608 --> 43:05.982
There are about 60 cameras.
All linked to security HQ.

43:06.066 --> 43:09.816
Hello, I've reserved a room
for Sophie Baroud.

43:10.315 --> 43:12.441
Cut them all
and the cops get an alert.

43:12.525 --> 43:15.024
We leave 5 recordings
going to avoid that.

43:15.108 --> 43:18.982
The other cameras keep filming,
but only in the security center.

43:19.066 --> 43:20.858
Is it fail-safe?

43:21.025 --> 43:23.775
I know the system inside and out.

43:24.658 --> 43:27.066
Hello, I've reserved a room
for Sophie Baroud.

43:27.150 --> 43:28.441
That's better.

43:28.608 --> 43:30.649
Look me in the eye
and sound confident.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.774
- Watch your voice.
- I stare?

43:32.858 --> 43:35.358
I'll cover you from the tower.

43:35.566 --> 43:39.150
Even with empty floors,
people can be there.

43:39.608 --> 43:40.942
Can we smoke it?

46:23.525 --> 46:24.732
Sarah?

48:28.816 --> 48:29.857
Don't move!

48:30.608 --> 48:32.657
- Don't move.
- I'm security too.

48:32.741 --> 48:34.775
I'll put my gun down and go.

48:35.416 --> 48:36.700
Freeze, I said.

48:36.916 --> 48:38.832
I know you. I'm security, too.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.583
Move and I'll shoot!

49:11.275 --> 49:14.691
- Mr. Devaux...
- That's right. Thanks.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.233
Goodbye.

49:21.983 --> 49:24.233
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

49:30.316 --> 49:32.816
Are you okay?
Sorry, I didn't see you.

49:32.900 --> 49:34.191
Are you okay?

52:50.608 --> 52:52.066
Thank you, goodbye.

52:52.150 --> 52:54.484
This way, please. Thank you.

52:58.066 --> 52:59.816
Madam, please...

53:03.566 --> 53:05.233
Have a good evening.

53:05.858 --> 53:08.358
Sir. Exit this way.

53:08.900 --> 53:10.108
Madam...

53:10.275 --> 53:12.525
Follow behind them, please.

53:13.483 --> 53:15.983
Young lady, leave now, please.

53:31.358 --> 53:33.357
It's a shit storm out there.

53:33.441 --> 53:35.041
- Any news?
- No connection.

53:35.125 --> 53:36.774
A skyscraper blew up.

53:36.858 --> 53:39.274
The Ministry of the Interior, too.

53:39.358 --> 53:41.624
- The city's on fire. It's war.
- What else?

53:41.708 --> 53:43.941
No idea.
The network's saturated.

53:44.025 --> 53:46.192
- How many dead?
- No idea.

53:46.316 --> 53:49.900
See you after the rounds.
I'm not going out.

55:23.233 --> 55:24.482
What's going on?

55:24.566 --> 55:26.082
Nothing. The door was open.

55:26.166 --> 55:27.983
Forget it. Carry on.

55:35.650 --> 55:37.317
Still no connection.

55:38.066 --> 55:40.400
Lights out. Put the news on.

56:31.691 --> 56:34.566
All clear! I'm down here!

57:47.400 --> 57:49.175
Did anyone screw up?

57:49.341 --> 57:51.108
- Not me.
- Sure?

57:51.275 --> 57:53.400
No one was followed?

57:55.900 --> 57:57.816
Omar? Is the alarm off?

57:57.900 --> 57:58.833
No sweat.

57:58.900 --> 58:01.274
- And the guards?
- All set, too.

58:01.358 --> 58:03.316
You tied them up?

58:03.483 --> 58:06.775
I aimed a gun at them.

58:06.941 --> 58:08.924
Then I gagged them
and tied them up.

58:09.008 --> 58:11.650
No worries, you can trust me.

58:12.733 --> 58:15.067
Stay off the lighting aisle.

58:15.191 --> 58:18.774
The cameras and sensors
are still recording there.

58:18.858 --> 58:21.566
It's off limits.
The rest is okay.

58:21.650 --> 58:24.274
- The shift change?
- We let them work.

58:24.358 --> 58:27.940
The security center is only
used in the evening.

58:28.024 --> 58:30.857
The cleaners never go in.
It's secure.

58:30.941 --> 58:33.491
- Omar, you're sure no one can see us?
- Don't worry.

58:33.575 --> 58:35.358
There's no street view.

58:38.441 --> 58:40.358
Weird. It's dead quiet.

58:40.608 --> 58:41.650
What?

58:42.358 --> 58:46.525
- Outside, I mean.
- You can't hear much from here.

58:47.483 --> 58:49.650
Fred and Greg are missing.

58:50.466 --> 58:52.566
- Fred's dead.
- What do you mean, dead?

58:52.650 --> 58:54.316
He got shot in the tower.

58:54.400 --> 58:57.400
- How?
- No idea, I didn't see it.

58:57.566 --> 58:59.983
I heard it from the corridor.

59:00.650 --> 59:03.567
I don't know who opened fire first.

59:04.066 --> 59:06.149
Then another guard arrived.

59:06.233 --> 59:09.900
He tried to stop Fred
but Fred tried to talk.

59:10.108 --> 59:13.482
But that didn't help.
The guy shot him anyway.

59:13.566 --> 59:15.900
And Greg? Why isn't he here?

59:19.525 --> 59:22.275
No idea, but Fred's dead anyways.

59:32.691 --> 59:34.900
You saw Fred get killed?

59:36.025 --> 59:38.775
- No, but I heard it.
- You heard?

59:39.150 --> 59:41.734
Maybe he wasn't the one killed.

59:42.650 --> 59:43.941
I feel rough.

59:45.108 --> 59:46.107
What's wrong?

59:46.191 --> 59:47.858
Dunno. I feel rough.

59:48.066 --> 59:49.274
I want to puke.

59:49.358 --> 59:50.982
Drink or eat something.

59:51.066 --> 59:53.441
- I think my arm's broke.
- How that?

59:53.900 --> 59:57.650
A car knocked me down
and my arm really hurts.

59:57.941 --> 01:00:00.858
- Do you hurt anywhere else?
- Here.

01:00:00.983 --> 01:00:03.233
We'll get you something.

01:00:08.816 --> 01:00:09.858
Come on.

01:00:14.233 --> 01:00:15.775
How did it happen?

01:00:15.941 --> 01:00:18.108
I crossed without looking.

01:00:20.566 --> 01:00:22.400
What did you do after?

01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:25.858
Nothing. I got up and ran off.

01:00:26.025 --> 01:00:28.025
No one followed you?

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:30.525
No, I swear. I ran off fast.

01:00:30.775 --> 01:00:31.859
Come with me.

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:34.858
Show me.

01:00:35.191 --> 01:00:36.150
Okay...

01:00:36.316 --> 01:00:38.025
Can you move it?

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:40.608
Okay, it's not broken.

01:00:40.775 --> 01:00:42.733
Just a nasty blow.

01:00:44.983 --> 01:00:47.275
What did we say we do now?

01:00:47.441 --> 01:00:49.608
We stay holed up here.

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:51.524
It'll be insanity outside.

01:00:51.608 --> 01:00:54.775
We go out tomorrow evening,
not before.

01:00:55.525 --> 01:00:58.191
If everything's okay,
we head home.

01:00:58.275 --> 01:01:00.192
You dumped your phones?

01:01:00.316 --> 01:01:03.399
Even new, unidentified ones
are dangerous.

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:04.525
Okay?

01:01:06.358 --> 01:01:08.232
Omar, where is the Semtex?

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:10.441
- In the store room.
- Show me.

01:01:21.608 --> 01:01:23.150
What happened?

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.066
We blew everything up.

01:01:51.508 --> 01:01:54.516
- Where were you when it went off?
- I didn't hear a thing.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.349
I took the metro and got here
as fast as I could.

01:01:57.433 --> 01:01:58.983
- Here it is.
- Great.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.699
If all else fails...

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.532
we can blow this place up, too.

01:02:02.616 --> 01:02:05.649
As long as no one screwed up
it'll be fine.

01:02:05.733 --> 01:02:07.150
Show me your gun.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.317
Your phone's off?

01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:16.608
No. In case my boss calls.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.691
You told mom
you wouldn't be home?

01:02:19.775 --> 01:02:21.775
I said I'd be at Mika's.

01:02:21.983 --> 01:02:23.191
And you?

01:02:23.358 --> 01:02:24.483
At Katia's.

01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:31.567
I screwed up with the credit card.

01:02:31.858 --> 01:02:32.899
How so?

01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:37.732
When I handed over the card,
the woman went into an office.

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:40.024
She said it was because
I hadn't signed it.

01:02:40.108 --> 01:02:43.692
She didn't need to
go to an office for that!

01:02:44.858 --> 01:02:47.191
I bet that bitch ratted on me.

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:50.566
No. It's just a piece of plastic
with a fake name.

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:53.191
Your prints aren't on file anyway.

01:02:53.275 --> 01:02:54.732
You're being paranoid.

01:02:54.816 --> 01:02:57.275
- Don't worry about it.
- I dunno.

01:03:00.775 --> 01:03:02.899
This quiet is freaking me out!

01:03:02.983 --> 01:03:05.567
The place must be soundproofed.

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.067
Think we can smoke?

01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:10.691
No, they must have detectors.

01:03:14.066 --> 01:03:15.524
Fuck, it's huge here.

01:03:15.608 --> 01:03:17.192
Yeah, mind-blowing.

01:03:18.233 --> 01:03:20.482
We should've set a bomb here too.

01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:22.107
It's weird doing nothing.

01:03:22.191 --> 01:03:23.316
What can we do?

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.440
Dunno. What time is it?

01:03:25.608 --> 01:03:26.650
10 PM.

01:03:27.816 --> 01:03:28.900
Where are we?

01:03:29.608 --> 01:03:30.900
I need to move.

01:03:31.066 --> 01:03:32.150
Hold on.

01:03:32.316 --> 01:03:33.941
I'll come with you.

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.358
Are you there?

01:04:05.233 --> 01:04:06.400
Anybody there?

01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:23.775
Omar!

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:25.066
What?

01:04:25.233 --> 01:04:26.941
How about some light?

01:04:27.025 --> 01:04:28.566
Will someone see?

01:04:28.733 --> 01:04:30.650
No, there's no windows.

01:04:31.691 --> 01:04:34.691
The guys working here must go crazy.

01:04:38.024 --> 01:04:40.358
Start the escalator up, too.

01:04:42.441 --> 01:04:43.483
Thanks.

01:04:50.233 --> 01:04:52.317
I'm sick of wearing this.

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:04.607
Don't watch me change.
Get lost.

01:05:04.691 --> 01:05:05.733
Get lost.

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.691
Why the knives?

01:05:42.858 --> 01:05:46.192
They might come in handy.
You never know.

01:05:52.608 --> 01:05:55.774
Greg missing freaks me out.
How'll he get in?

01:05:55.858 --> 01:05:58.108
He'll figure something out.

01:06:03.483 --> 01:06:04.817
Careful, please.

01:06:10.525 --> 01:06:11.691
What was that?

01:06:11.775 --> 01:06:12.900
That was me.

01:06:13.066 --> 01:06:15.775
- I broke something.
- Fucking watch out!

01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:51.108
Are you there?

01:07:38.691 --> 01:07:41.025
Think we killed many people?

01:07:41.733 --> 01:07:44.650
No idea.
We tried not to. Forget it.

01:07:47.525 --> 01:07:49.859
We know nothing. It's crazy.

01:07:53.983 --> 01:07:56.483
Look, it's the same one I use.

01:08:01.025 --> 01:08:03.066
Why do you do this stuff?

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:05.317
It's okay. Are you scared?

01:08:05.525 --> 01:08:07.109
No, I'm not scared.

01:08:12.191 --> 01:08:15.775
But I never thought
I could do such a thing.

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:20.857
You're beautiful.

01:08:22.608 --> 01:08:25.942
Go on.
Help yourself to clothes upstairs.

01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:50.316
Not too loud!

01:08:50.483 --> 01:08:51.689
Don't worry.

01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:53.733
Classy!

01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:55.483
Thanks.

01:08:56.483 --> 01:08:58.399
Can we turn these on?

01:08:58.466 --> 01:08:59.624
Yeah, I guess.

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:02.024
I don't know how, though.

01:09:02.191 --> 01:09:03.358
I'll check.

01:09:16.274 --> 01:09:18.483
- Are they working?
- No.

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:19.691
Hold on.

01:09:23.941 --> 01:09:24.983
And now?

01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:26.774
Yeah!

01:09:41.233 --> 01:09:43.733
It's wild, seeing it for real.

01:09:44.274 --> 01:09:48.524
SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS IN PARIS

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:21.525
What's that?

01:10:22.566 --> 01:10:24.400
- What?
- The music.

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:26.609
Willow Smith.

01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:29.941
She was 10 when she sang this.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.316
Seen the video?

01:10:31.483 --> 01:10:33.108
It's totally sick.

01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:34.525
Who cares?

01:10:34.691 --> 01:10:36.057
Check out the sound.

01:10:36.141 --> 01:10:37.608
It's awesome, huh?

01:10:55.066 --> 01:10:57.066
I'm fucking locked out!

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:11.317
Still no connection.

01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:17.274
Won't the cleaners find the guys
in the security center?

01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:19.608
No, they don't go in there.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.191
Won't they suspect something?

01:11:22.275 --> 01:11:23.899
Nah, I'll be around.

01:11:23.983 --> 01:11:25.357
They don't give a shit.

01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:27.524
It's every man for himself here.

01:11:27.608 --> 01:11:29.525
- Can I smoke?
- No.

01:11:29.691 --> 01:11:32.899
Not here,
you'll set off the detector things.

01:11:32.983 --> 01:11:36.317
- Where did you find it?
- The toy aisle.

01:11:37.858 --> 01:11:40.275
- And this one?
- It's Omar's.

01:11:46.316 --> 01:11:48.358
- Sure it's real?
- Yeah.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:51.984
Don't screw around, okay.

01:11:52.483 --> 01:11:54.441
Screw around? Are you serious?

01:11:54.525 --> 01:11:57.982
The others screw around
with music and clothes.

01:11:58.066 --> 01:11:59.566
It's all bullshit.

01:12:39.775 --> 01:12:41.609
We'll put it all back.

01:12:55.108 --> 01:12:56.150
And these?

01:13:00.316 --> 01:13:02.691
What's after men's clothing?

01:13:02.858 --> 01:13:05.025
Dunno, we didn't go there.

01:15:53.775 --> 01:15:54.859
Good evening.

01:15:55.566 --> 01:15:56.816
How's it going?

01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:58.067
Fine, okay.

01:15:59.566 --> 01:16:01.275
What's going on?

01:16:01.775 --> 01:16:03.107
It's total panic.

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.482
I don't really know.

01:16:04.566 --> 01:16:05.483
Bombs.

01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:07.567
But I don't know where.

01:16:20.358 --> 01:16:21.692
Want to come in?

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.399
- Where?
- Inside the store.

01:16:24.483 --> 01:16:25.732
It's open tonight.

01:16:25.816 --> 01:16:28.691
Why? 
What are you doing in there?

01:16:28.775 --> 01:16:32.149
It's my dad's store.
He said I could invite some friends.

01:16:32.233 --> 01:16:33.650
If you're cold...

01:16:33.816 --> 01:16:35.357
there's plenty to drink.

01:16:35.441 --> 01:16:38.450
- Good wine, if you feel like it.
- Dunno.

01:16:40.775 --> 01:16:42.275
What's your name?

01:16:42.441 --> 01:16:43.650
Jean-Claude.

01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:46.108
Well, Jean-Claude...

01:16:46.275 --> 01:16:48.275
I'm waiting for my wife.

01:16:48.441 --> 01:16:51.191
Okay, well...
When she arrives, come in.

01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:53.149
I'll put a wedge under the door.

01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:54.858
Just pull it open.

01:17:02.316 --> 01:17:03.483
Where are you?

01:17:20.025 --> 01:17:21.192
Where are you?

01:17:41.025 --> 01:17:42.607
Where are the others?

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:44.441
Watching TV.

01:17:44.608 --> 01:17:45.858
Are you okay?

01:17:46.025 --> 01:17:47.233
Fuck.

01:17:48.316 --> 01:17:49.775
You asshole.

01:18:23.191 --> 01:18:25.149
It's a day of total terror.

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.941
You heard the President earlier.

01:18:28.108 --> 01:18:30.024
In a short but intense speech.

01:18:30.108 --> 01:18:32.907
He speak several times
of the word 'horror'.

01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:35.691
He has promised the use
of 'unlimited resources'

01:18:35.775 --> 01:18:38.066
he added from the Elysée.

01:18:38.233 --> 01:18:40.524
This afternoon near the Louvre...

01:18:40.608 --> 01:18:42.957
an explosion started a fire.

01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:45.607
- That is now under control.
- Turn it off.

01:18:45.691 --> 01:18:48.482
No, hold on.
Wait to see if there are any dead.

01:18:48.566 --> 01:18:50.532
Turn it off.
They'll only talk crap.

01:18:50.616 --> 01:18:53.066
All nonsense.
We did what we had to.

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:55.649
Don't go on the net
at home tomorrow.

01:18:55.733 --> 01:18:59.216
There'll be bullshit comments.
We don't need that.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.857
Hey, the connection's back.

01:19:00.941 --> 01:19:04.232
The police say the attack
may be linked to the others,

01:19:04.316 --> 01:19:06.982
but was carried out
by different people.

01:19:07.066 --> 01:19:08.732
Not much on Facebook.

01:19:08.816 --> 01:19:11.649
So get better friends
and turn that shit off.

01:19:11.733 --> 01:19:14.107
We should've blown up Facebook.

01:19:14.191 --> 01:19:15.941
And MEDEF.

01:20:49.316 --> 01:20:50.358
Turn around.

01:20:51.233 --> 01:20:52.275
Turn around.

01:21:41.275 --> 01:21:43.982
I'm ready to die.
After my death, carry out an autopsy

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.900
to see if I was mentally deranged.

01:22:24.816 --> 01:22:25.983
What do we do?

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:28.191
I dunno.

01:22:29.483 --> 01:22:30.817
What time is it?

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.234
Quarter past midnight.

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.983
Another ten hours to wait.

01:22:41.025 --> 01:22:43.692
I'm going to smoke.
I'll be back.

01:22:59.025 --> 01:23:01.316
It's wild.
Want to try it?

01:25:25.441 --> 01:25:28.441
Excuse me, do you
know what time it is?

01:25:28.525 --> 01:25:30.108
No, sorry.

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:36.566
Do you know what happened today?
I'm a bit lost.

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:38.567
I don't know much more.

01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:42.233
Several simultaneous bombs, fires...

01:25:43.108 --> 01:25:45.608
It seems calmer now.

01:25:48.691 --> 01:25:50.524
Some people are overjoyed.

01:25:50.608 --> 01:25:53.400
And then you see others crying

01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:55.358
they say it's war.

01:25:57.108 --> 01:26:00.442
But I think it's over now.
I think they're finished.

01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:04.150
Do they know who did it?

01:26:04.316 --> 01:26:06.650
Apparently they'll be found.

01:26:06.983 --> 01:26:08.841
No one's claimed anything.

01:26:08.925 --> 01:26:11.733
Valls says there are serious leads.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.315
But he won't say more.

01:26:13.399 --> 01:26:16.399
He just said they
may not be foreign.

01:26:19.233 --> 01:26:21.316
But, quite frankly...

01:26:23.066 --> 01:26:24.608
Frankly what?

01:26:26.566 --> 01:26:29.233
It was bound to happen, right?

01:26:29.858 --> 01:26:31.316
I dunno. I guess.

01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:33.025
You bet.

01:26:33.191 --> 01:26:36.149
It had to happen.
It really had to happen.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:37.733
And now it has.

01:27:21.275 --> 01:27:22.192
Don't move!

01:27:23.191 --> 01:27:24.107
Don't move.

01:27:24.191 --> 01:27:25.399
I'm security too.

01:27:25.483 --> 01:27:27.900
I'll put my gun down and go.

01:27:28.608 --> 01:27:29.983
Freeze, I said.

01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:31.566
I'm security too.

01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:34.567
- Fuck.
- Move and I'll shoot!

01:27:44.858 --> 01:27:46.525
I'm starving!

01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:53.191
- Got a euro?
- No, I left them back in my jeans.

01:27:53.275 --> 01:27:54.566
Got a euro?

01:28:20.733 --> 01:28:22.982
Great job getting to the store room.

01:28:23.066 --> 01:28:25.441
I told you I'd make it and I did.

01:28:25.525 --> 01:28:27.732
I just had to reach the back stairs.

01:28:27.816 --> 01:28:28.857
It was tough.

01:28:28.941 --> 01:28:30.275
No, it was easy.

01:28:31.608 --> 01:28:32.650
Turn around.

01:28:34.883 --> 01:28:36.416
- What?
- Some makeup.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.816
No, cut it out.

01:28:37.983 --> 01:28:39.233
Just relax.

01:28:39.775 --> 01:28:40.816
Don't move.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:43.817
My handsome warrior.

01:28:44.358 --> 01:28:45.899
And I'm not a warrior?

01:28:45.983 --> 01:28:47.441
Your turn next.

01:28:47.608 --> 01:28:48.942
You're handsome.

01:29:08.441 --> 01:29:10.941
- Got plans tomorrow night?
- Me?

01:29:11.025 --> 01:29:13.192
I told my mom I'd be home.

01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:15.525
- You?
- Dunno.

01:29:16.775 --> 01:29:17.941
Where were you?

01:29:18.025 --> 01:29:19.233
Nowhere.

01:29:20.141 --> 01:29:21.607
All the doors are locked,

01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:23.766
he can't get in.
Stop worrying.

01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:27.691
Maybe. But it stresses me out
not knowing where he is.

01:29:27.775 --> 01:29:30.691
Maybe he's dead,
maybe he's talking...

01:29:30.775 --> 01:29:32.391
What do you mean?
Nonsense.

01:29:32.475 --> 01:29:33.833
What time is it?

01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.025
1:30.

01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:36.483
Not eating?

01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:37.775
No.

01:29:38.275 --> 01:29:39.566
Not hungry?

01:29:40.358 --> 01:29:41.692
Something wrong?

01:29:41.816 --> 01:29:43.857
I'm okay, I'm just a bit tired.

01:29:43.941 --> 01:29:45.858
Tired, all of a sudden.

01:29:46.358 --> 01:29:47.400
To Fred.

01:29:52.608 --> 01:29:53.650
And to us!

01:30:03.608 --> 01:30:06.149
I don't want any trouble, okay?

01:30:06.233 --> 01:30:07.066
No.

01:30:07.233 --> 01:30:10.650
We were told we could come in.

01:30:10.816 --> 01:30:13.107
It's okay,
she was just surprised to see you.

01:30:13.191 --> 01:30:15.400
There's food and drink.

01:30:15.566 --> 01:30:19.233
Make sure you're not seen
if you go back out.

01:30:23.066 --> 01:30:24.816
You realize what you're doing?

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.566
Yes, I know exactly.

01:30:26.650 --> 01:30:29.899
They'll eat some food
and we'll never see them again.

01:30:29.983 --> 01:30:31.983
Think they'll rat on us?

01:30:32.316 --> 01:30:33.733
They're homeless.

01:30:42.483 --> 01:30:44.399
What is this?
Are you kidding?

01:30:44.483 --> 01:30:46.775
You're totally sick!

01:30:47.858 --> 01:30:48.732
Quiet.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.857
Look around, Yacine,
before you get mad like that.

01:30:51.941 --> 01:30:53.275
You're a nutjob.

01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:56.116
Don't let them
out of your sight, okay?

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.774
Only let them go
if someone takes over.

01:30:58.858 --> 01:30:59.900
Okay.

01:31:00.065 --> 01:31:01.357
Or we shoot them.

01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:03.608
Cut it out, you dumb jerk.

01:31:23.441 --> 01:31:24.775
What time is it?

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:36.649
David, I'm starting to freak out.

01:31:36.733 --> 01:31:38.483
Why? Because of them?

01:31:39.108 --> 01:31:40.775
I dunno. No, it's...

01:31:41.566 --> 01:31:44.274
It's the idea of going out
tomorrow and seeing it all.

01:31:44.358 --> 01:31:45.483
I don't know.

01:31:48.733 --> 01:31:50.275
Don't worry, baby.

01:31:51.691 --> 01:31:52.775
Come with me.

01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:41.275
Look.

01:35:41.441 --> 01:35:43.358
This is too big for me.

01:36:01.025 --> 01:36:02.566
We're all gonna die.

01:36:02.650 --> 01:36:04.317
We're all gonna die.

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:07.099
- We're all gonna die.
- We aren't.

01:36:07.183 --> 01:36:08.524
- Yes, we will.
- No.

01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:12.732
A cop watched me on the cherry-picker.
Then he left, but he saw everything.

01:36:12.816 --> 01:36:15.358
- They'll find us and we'll all die.
- No.

01:36:15.525 --> 01:36:17.525
Yes, we're going to die.

01:36:40.358 --> 01:36:42.983
HOLED UP IN THE HEART OF PARIS

01:37:20.066 --> 01:37:21.108
André.

01:37:31.316 --> 01:37:32.358
André!

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.357
Come and see.

01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:40.149
No information yet on the
number of terrorists

01:37:40.233 --> 01:37:41.900
or their identity.

01:37:42.066 --> 01:37:46.108
A crisis meeting is underway
at the Elysée...

01:37:46.275 --> 01:37:48.441
- How did this happen?
- Dunno.

01:37:48.525 --> 01:37:51.109
- How is it possible?
- No idea.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:37:59.649
Don't tell the others.

01:37:59.733 --> 01:38:00.691
Why not?

01:38:02.983 --> 01:38:05.275
It'll only panic them.

01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:08.107
The cops won't just show up.

01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:12.025
We might've rigged explosives
or have hostages.

01:38:12.275 --> 01:38:14.025
We have to stay calm.

01:38:15.358 --> 01:38:17.275
I never set the bomb.

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.858
I left the tower before.

01:38:24.983 --> 01:38:26.025
Too bad.

01:38:27.983 --> 01:38:31.067
- Where're you going?
- The storeroom.

01:39:17.025 --> 01:39:18.859
Everything okay, Omar?

01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.317
Great sound, huh?

01:39:23.775 --> 01:39:25.691
Anything on the news?

01:39:25.858 --> 01:39:27.400
Yeah. Nothing new.

01:40:29.066 --> 01:40:30.108
Wake up.

01:40:32.191 --> 01:40:34.649
- I fell asleep.
- Come on, get dressed.

01:40:34.733 --> 01:40:35.775
Get dressed.

01:40:36.608 --> 01:40:37.650
Get dressed.

01:40:59.233 --> 01:41:02.067
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:41:21.815 --> 01:41:23.565
Want a wedding dress?

01:41:24.358 --> 01:41:26.858
- Take one.
- No. I don't care.

01:41:27.025 --> 01:41:27.858
Come on.

01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.567
- What's wrong, David?
- Nothing.

01:42:17.483 --> 01:42:19.983
Wait here for me,
I'll be back.

01:42:48.133 --> 01:42:49.249
Everything okay?

01:42:49.333 --> 01:42:51.732
Yeah, I'll put the rest
on the other side.

01:42:51.816 --> 01:42:54.108
- Okay. Need a hand?
- No.

01:42:54.275 --> 01:42:58.192
Talk to the others.
We'll use this to negotiate.

01:43:17.566 --> 01:43:19.483
Want to get in with me?

01:43:20.025 --> 01:43:21.066
No, thanks.

01:43:25.066 --> 01:43:26.983
Think we'll get caught?

01:43:27.566 --> 01:43:30.191
Impossible.
But I don't give a damn.

01:43:30.275 --> 01:43:32.150
- You don't?
- No.

01:43:32.775 --> 01:43:34.483
No, I don't.

01:43:34.650 --> 01:43:37.316
We did something wild
that no one has done before.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.858
Do you realize?

01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:42.275
Nothing will be the same again.

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:46.066
And you know what?
We'll go to paradise.

01:43:46.316 --> 01:43:49.650
Not just me, you too.
And all the others.

01:43:54.566 --> 01:43:56.316
What're you drinking?

01:43:56.483 --> 01:43:57.650
Cognac.

01:43:58.983 --> 01:44:00.358
Let me try some.

01:44:03.691 --> 01:44:06.691
You know, our history teacher...

01:44:07.316 --> 01:44:10.400
She told us this totally crazy story.

01:44:10.650 --> 01:44:14.066
During the Iran-Iraq war,
Iran sent children

01:44:14.150 --> 01:44:15.899
and old folks
to clear mines.

01:44:15.983 --> 01:44:18.149
They sent them out as scouts.

01:44:18.233 --> 01:44:19.941
They promised them paradise.

01:44:20.025 --> 01:44:22.899
So the kids went to clear the mines.

01:44:22.983 --> 01:44:25.532
- Loads were blown up.
- So they're in paradise?

01:44:25.616 --> 01:44:28.316
No. No, no, no.
That's not the crazy part.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.356
Just before sending kids,
they sent donkeys.

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:34.524
But the donkeys
refused to move after a while.

01:44:34.608 --> 01:44:36.775
So they sent kids instead.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.400
Yeah.

01:44:41.607 --> 01:44:42.982
Give me your telephone.

01:44:43.066 --> 01:44:45.900
- Who are you calling?
- Forget it.

01:45:03.775 --> 01:45:05.150
Hi Mom, it's me.

01:45:05.608 --> 01:45:09.775
I know it's early,
but I had something to tell you.

01:45:10.608 --> 01:45:13.400
The garage door is still broken.

01:45:13.566 --> 01:45:17.025
I'm worried you might end up
locked in.

01:45:17.191 --> 01:45:19.025
Get it repaired, okay?

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.482
And... I'll come to lunch on Sunday.

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:26.233
Just make sure you don't get
locked in, okay?

01:45:26.525 --> 01:45:29.275
Lots of love, Mom.
See you Sunday.

01:45:29.816 --> 01:45:30.858
I love you.

01:45:36.275 --> 01:45:38.025
Where are the others?

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.733
Get in with me.

01:45:42.341 --> 01:45:44.416
No, come on.
I said I didn't want to.

01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.784
Where's Mika?

01:45:46.316 --> 01:45:47.441
No idea.

01:46:31.441 --> 01:46:32.483
Mika!

01:46:37.650 --> 01:46:38.858
Shit, Greg.

01:46:41.441 --> 01:46:42.775
What time is it?

01:46:43.733 --> 01:46:44.858
4 AM.

01:46:46.358 --> 01:46:48.358
Where the fuck were you?

01:46:49.108 --> 01:46:50.150
I ran.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.150
I didn't stop.

01:46:53.733 --> 01:46:58.233
When I left the guy's office,
I ended up on the street.

01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:01.650
In the confusion,
I still had my gun.

01:47:02.316 --> 01:47:04.150
I forgot to hide it.

01:47:05.108 --> 01:47:07.442
I fucking forgot to hide it.

01:47:07.733 --> 01:47:09.817
I had the gun in my hand.

01:47:10.858 --> 01:47:13.191
I started running like crazy.

01:47:13.275 --> 01:47:16.482
I kept thinking:
"You won't get into the store.

01:47:16.566 --> 01:47:19.400
"It's too late.
You won't get in."

01:47:20.941 --> 01:47:22.733
"You won't get in."

01:47:24.025 --> 01:47:25.816
So I stopped running.

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:29.608
I just stood there.

01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:32.941
So I blew my brains out

01:47:33.108 --> 01:47:35.358
rather than end up in jail.

01:47:36.816 --> 01:47:39.024
Wouldn't you have done that?

01:47:39.108 --> 01:47:40.608
Tell me the truth.

01:47:41.533 --> 01:47:43.191
Wouldn't you have done that?

01:47:43.275 --> 01:47:44.691
Huh? Mika?

01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:48.025
Wouldn't you have done that?

01:47:48.275 --> 01:47:51.441
Okay. Lots of love, Mom.
See you Sunday.

01:47:51.525 --> 01:47:52.566
I love you.

01:48:06.691 --> 01:48:09.149
I had a fucking horrible nightmare.

01:48:09.233 --> 01:48:11.650
Want to see a real nightmare?

01:48:14.275 --> 01:48:17.233
...which means the police operation

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:22.483
...is  all the more delicate,
all the more complex.

01:48:22.650 --> 01:48:26.024
The Interior Ministry
has limited us to studio broadcasts.

01:48:26.108 --> 01:48:28.941
These images won't be shown again

01:48:29.150 --> 01:48:31.316
...until the end of the operation.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.107
What will happen next, François Bo?

01:48:34.191 --> 01:48:36.941
How will the forces of order
go about this?

01:48:37.025 --> 01:48:41.732
Given the selected targets, these aren't
terrorists but enemies of the state.

01:48:41.816 --> 01:48:45.691
Officially, it means that
negotiation is no longer obligatory.

01:48:45.775 --> 01:48:47.109
that the only --

01:48:47.650 --> 01:48:49.690
- There's a full sound system?
- Yeah.

01:48:49.774 --> 01:48:51.941
Put some music on, please.

01:49:53.065 --> 01:49:55.150
I'm gonna fuck you...

01:50:05.691 --> 01:50:06.775
Wait.

01:50:33.299 --> 01:50:34.333
What's up?

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.875
- We have Semtex, but no detonators.
- What?

01:50:36.941 --> 01:50:38.774
We have Semtex, but no detonators.

01:50:38.858 --> 01:50:39.833
How come?

01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:42.317
We never planned on using it.

01:50:47.108 --> 01:50:49.692
Take some and look for an exit.

01:51:14.566 --> 01:51:18.233
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yes, it's quite tasty.

01:51:21.066 --> 01:51:22.400
What time is it?

01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:27.108
Time for coffee
and buttered bread.

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:44.441
Sarah!

01:54:05.066 --> 01:54:06.275
It's over.

01:54:06.441 --> 01:54:09.108
- What's over?
- It's over, okay.

01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:28.941
I love you.

01:54:42.858 --> 01:54:45.399
Shit, I was looking all over.
Where were you?

01:54:45.483 --> 01:54:46.525
I'm here.

01:54:47.233 --> 01:54:48.983
You like this, right?

01:54:50.691 --> 01:54:51.900
I love it.

01:55:04.025 --> 01:55:05.441
Where're you going?

01:55:05.525 --> 01:55:07.066
To find coffee.

01:55:07.232 --> 01:55:09.358
Frankly, man to man,

01:55:09.525 --> 01:55:11.940
isn't this look totally wild?

01:55:12.024 --> 01:55:13.066
Fantastic.

01:55:53.566 --> 01:55:56.025
Police!
Drop the gun!

01:55:57.066 --> 01:55:58.816
You like this, right?

01:55:59.233 --> 01:56:00.275
I love it.

01:56:02.482 --> 01:56:04.899
I always watched it as a kid.

01:56:31.566 --> 01:56:32.941
Police!

01:57:09.941 --> 01:57:11.149
Where're you going?

01:57:11.233 --> 01:57:13.108
To find coffee.

01:57:13.275 --> 01:57:17.359
Frankly, man to man,
isn't this look totally wild?

01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:19.941
Fantastic.

01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:00.317
Police!
Drop the gun!

02:00:20.608 --> 02:00:22.066
I'm gonna die.

02:00:31.233 --> 02:00:32.400
What do we do?

02:00:35.025 --> 02:00:37.942
- What the fuck do we do?
- No idea.

02:00:39.775 --> 02:00:40.941
I have this.

02:00:45.566 --> 02:00:47.691
Take the gun.
Give me that.

02:00:47.775 --> 02:00:50.859
- Be right back.
- Where're you going?

02:01:08.608 --> 02:01:11.066
I didn't tie up the guards.

02:01:11.233 --> 02:01:13.232
- I killed them.
- Why did you do that?

02:01:13.316 --> 02:01:14.608
- Dunno.
- Shit.

02:03:30.066 --> 02:03:30.983
Ciao.

02:04:55.275 --> 02:04:58.566
On three, we run for the stairs.
Okay?

02:04:58.733 --> 02:04:59.983
You go first.

02:05:00.525 --> 02:05:02.359
Hold on, not just yet.

02:05:16.566 --> 02:05:17.608
Ready?

02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:20.941
One...

02:05:22.191 --> 02:05:23.066
Two...

02:06:40.691 --> 02:06:41.733
Paradise...

02:06:43.233 --> 02:06:44.275
Paradise...

02:07:26.316 --> 02:07:27.358
Help me...

02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:29.941
Help me.

02:07:32.066 --> 02:07:33.108
Help me!

02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:36.691
Help me!

02:07:43.275 --> 02:07:44.608
Help me.
