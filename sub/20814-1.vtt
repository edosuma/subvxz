01:08.635 --> 01:12.604
Choir: Shall
we gather at the river

01:12.606 --> 01:17.810
where bright angel
feet have trod?

01:17.812 --> 01:22.581
With its crystal tide forever

01:22.583 --> 01:27.352
flowing by the throne of god.

01:27.354 --> 01:32.624
Yes, we'll gather at the
river, the beautiful,

01:32.626 --> 01:34.860
the beautiful river.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.573
What?
Hey!

01:47.575 --> 01:48.640
What are you doing?

01:48.642 --> 01:49.842
Get out of here.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.343
Hey!

02:43.730 --> 02:44.763
Fear.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.534
Fear ye, the lord your god.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.768
Or forever in hell...

02:50.938 --> 02:54.473
Preacher: You'll be
cast into a lake of fire

02:54.475 --> 02:55.641
with Satan himself, and there...

02:55.643 --> 02:58.210
I've been waiting for you.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.178
Ah.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.512
The gnashing of teeth.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.314
He who even looks at a woman.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.816
Why does Satan want
to mash your teeth?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.618
He's already committed adultery.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.322
So if your eye offends you,
if it causes you to lust,

03:10.324 --> 03:11.323
pluck it out.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.958
Cast it away.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.394
Same thing with your nose.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.395
How many...

03:16.397 --> 03:17.262
Get away from there.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.864
Somebody's gonna see you.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.266
Your father is
in rare form today.

03:21.268 --> 03:24.303
Speaking of rare
form, where'd you

03:24.305 --> 03:25.571
learn how to kiss like that?

03:25.573 --> 03:28.574
Just doing what comes natural.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.408
Mm.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.976
I like nature.

03:31.679 --> 03:37.349
You know, the only way
to get to eternal glory

03:37.351 --> 03:41.220
is through sacrifice.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.821
Somehow, somewhere,
someday, the good lord

03:42.823 --> 03:48.694
is going to ask you maybe to
make a tremendous sacrifice.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.363
And on that day,
what will you say?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.764
How will you answer him?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.000
Will you answer him yes?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.401
Yes?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.703
Will you answer him yes?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.338
All: Yes.

03:59.340 --> 04:03.875
I think we need to
practice sacrificing

04:03.877 --> 04:06.545
now, starting today.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.747
When the collection
plate goes by,

04:08.749 --> 04:12.517
I want you to sacrifice as
much as you possibly can

04:12.519 --> 04:13.285
to the lord.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.487
Remember, money is
the root of all evil,

04:15.489 --> 04:19.291
so use this opportunity
to rid yourself

04:19.293 --> 04:21.593
of as much evil as possible.

04:21.595 --> 04:26.698
Remember, it is written,
ask how much to give,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.967
and you shall receive an answer.

04:28.969 --> 04:34.539
And folks, lord loves a
hilarious giver, so please,

04:34.541 --> 04:36.975
let me hear some laughter.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.410
A little laughter.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.645
Don't hurt that much.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.546
Let me hear some laughter.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.515
Come on.
Come on.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.584
Come on.

04:45.586 --> 04:49.354
The lord loves the
hilarious giver.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.793
I'd like to thank you.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.996
The lord appreciates
your generosity.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.800
You know, it is this spirit
of giving which enabled us

05:01.802 --> 05:06.938
to acquire this magnificent
stained glass window

05:06.940 --> 05:09.308
imported directly from Italy.

05:09.310 --> 05:16.615
I'm sure we will treasure it
for many, many years

05:16.617 --> 05:17.949
to come.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.786
Amen to that.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.422
Mm.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.489
Kelly?

05:24.491 --> 05:24.956
Yeah.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.358
Do you know what today is?

05:26.360 --> 05:30.062
I'm guessing it's Sunday.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.396
Besides that.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.398
It's the 10-year
year anniversary

05:33.400 --> 05:34.800
of the day we first met.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.400
Yeah.

05:35.402 --> 05:38.036
I was seven and you were eight.

05:38.038 --> 05:38.904
Remember?

05:38.906 --> 05:41.707
I was a bat girl in
your little league team.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.042
I went over to pick
up a bat, and you

05:44.044 --> 05:45.544
were practicing your swing.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.713
And I knocked out
your front four teeth.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.581
Oh, so romantic.

05:49.583 --> 05:54.019
Yeah, well, if you
think that's romantic,

05:54.021 --> 05:56.355
check this out.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.723
Oh. Kelly.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.757
It opens.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.558
Open it.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.492
It's beautiful.

06:00.494 --> 06:06.498
I'm never going to take it off.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.500
I love you, Kelly Hankins.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.002
And I love you, Lisa weld.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.606
Help me put it on.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.674
Of course.

06:15.676 --> 06:16.975
Yeah.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.879
All right.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.847
Got it?

06:21.849 --> 06:23.448
Yeah.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.388
Tomorrow starts our
first day of senior year.

06:29.390 --> 06:29.888
I know.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.091
I mean, this could be the
best year of our lives.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.894
What's your favorite
thing about school?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.130
My favorite thing about school?

06:38.132 --> 06:41.166
Well, besides you?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.534
Baseball season.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.670
I mean, there's just
something about it...

06:45.672 --> 06:50.642
Standing, on the mound
and game's on the line.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.778
I have a chance to be a hero.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.715
Everyone's chanting
"Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!"

06:56.717 --> 07:00.852
I know everyone's behind me,

07:00.854 --> 07:07.859
and they're gonna trust I
make the right decision.

07:07.861 --> 07:11.997
It's just one time,
I'd like to just

07:11.999 --> 07:19.638
reach out and grab that feeling
and hold onto it forever.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.473
I wish I could feel that way.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.042
But I'd be scared to death.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.044
You're scared of everything.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.514
Well, don't you ever get afraid?

07:29.516 --> 07:30.182
Sometimes.

07:30.184 --> 07:36.521
Like, does it make sense
to be afraid of being afraid?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.623
What do you mean?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.460
When I'm trusted to
make the big decision,

07:41.462 --> 07:45.664
like, the really big
decision, could I do it?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.834
Would I cave?

07:48.836 --> 07:53.038
Kelly, Kelly,
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.607
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.509
Very funny.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.510
How about you?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.212
What's your favorite thing?

08:00.214 --> 08:02.180
Hm.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.485
I like the dances.

08:06.487 --> 08:12.891
It's the only time I
can hold you in public.

08:13.626 --> 08:16.094
How much longer do we
have to keep this secret?

08:16.096 --> 08:19.030
Eight months, one
week, and three days.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.501
My 18th birthday,
the day my father

08:22.503 --> 08:25.670
finally allows me
to start dating.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.606
It feels like forever.

08:27.608 --> 08:31.142
I mean, you may not
even love me anymore.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.712
I could go crazy,
gain 100 pounds, bald.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.645
I don't know.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.749
I'd still love you.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.284
Why don't we tell
your father right now.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.553
That's a terrible idea.

08:41.554 --> 08:45.590
Then I wouldn't be allowed to
date until I was crazy, bald,

08:45.592 --> 08:48.126
and gained 100 pounds.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.763
Well, I'd still love you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.298
All right, coward.

08:53.300 --> 08:57.035
Eight months, one
week, three days.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.770
It's a date.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.906
On one condition.

09:00.908 --> 09:01.673
All right.

09:01.675 --> 09:06.578
On my first date, I want
to wear the biggest, most

09:06.580 --> 09:09.948
beautiful pink orchid in town.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.784
I'd do anything for you.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.952
Anything at all.

09:13.954 --> 09:19.858
Well, I've
got a heavy hankering for you,

09:19.860 --> 09:22.227
Kelly Hankins.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.036
Mary, good to see you.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.070
You too.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.238
Hey, Bob.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.674
Pleasure, sir.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.875
Oh.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.577
Good to see you.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.745
And just where have
you been, young lady?

09:40.747 --> 09:41.813
I needed to use the bathroom.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.916
Lisa, you need to understand
the importance of the example

09:44.918 --> 09:46.785
you set for our young people.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.153
Yes, daddy.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.589
You... hi, hi.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.625
You provide the moral
guidance with your virtue

09:53.627 --> 09:55.293
- for our entire community.
- Yes, daddy.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.631
I expect you sitting at the
front row of every service.

09:59.633 --> 10:00.365
I will be, daddy.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.901
Oh, the Hankins family.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.669
Good morning, reverend weld.

10:04.671 --> 10:05.203
Gloria.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.172
Wonderful sermon
today, reverend.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.374
And how are you, Jimmy?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.175
Just fine, sir.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.977
- About your sermon today?
- Yes.

10:11.979 --> 10:17.816
If money is the root of all
evil, how do I fertilize it?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.818
Quite the mind
on this young man.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.687
Quite an original thinker.

10:22.689 --> 10:23.822
Wonderful.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.255
Hm.

10:24.257 --> 10:28.326
Kelly, how's the arm on
Butterhill's star pitcher?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.728
It's great, sir.
Thank you.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.963
It's good.
We are all counting on you.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.367
This is... this is very stylish.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.868
It's the new style.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.203
You should try it, sir.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.071
I think I might.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.172
Well, good to see you.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.307
Good to see you.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.975
Pleasure, sir.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.024
Hey.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.692
I'm coming.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.364
Hey, bombs away!

11:06.366 --> 11:07.799
Gosh, get off me.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.233
Baa.

11:08.235 --> 11:11.202
Pretend like you're actually
a normal human being for once.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.004
Ah, you don't want that.
Ah.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.739
- No.
- Come here, babe.

11:14.741 --> 11:17.275
First day of senior year.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.743
- You smiling?
- Yes.

11:18.745 --> 11:20.178
- This is for my mother.
- I know.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.047
It's going on
the Christmas card.

11:22.049 --> 11:22.981
Ok.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.315
Cheese.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.418
Ok.
Great.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.086
Preserved for all eternity.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.054
Yeah.

11:29.056 --> 11:29.821
Oh, yes.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.689
I feel good all under.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.857
Are you finally wearing
the right sized underwear?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.226
Underwear.
Underwear, underwear, underwear.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.461
Nopes. Oh, well.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.798
More room to, uh,
indulge that bulge, you know?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.432
Yeah, you wish.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.900
You know what I'm saying?

11:41.902 --> 11:43.835
Walk in swinging.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.769
All right, Ace.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.470
Let's burn rubber.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.841
These ladies are awaiting
our glorious presence.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.909
Woo.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.458
Who's that driving
the green bug?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.127
That's Frankie Wilson.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.329
Sure is an improvement
over that old Van.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.196
I don't know.

12:45.198 --> 12:49.768
I mean, you could really stretch
your legs out in that Van.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.769
Oooh.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.170
What is this?

13:04.950 --> 13:07.152
Hello, ladies.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.154
Oh, well, that sucks.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.089
It's Milton.

13:11.091 --> 13:11.856
Ew.

13:11.858 --> 13:13.258
Hey, there's Kelly Hankins.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.026
Who's that with him?

13:15.028 --> 13:15.960
That's ditto Moore.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.797
Girl: You mean Ditzo Moore.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.331
Hi, Kelly.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.065
Hi, candy.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.934
- How was your summer?
- Awful.

13:22.936 --> 13:26.905
I just stared at my phone and
prayed for a call from you,

13:26.907 --> 13:29.174
but my prayers went unanswered.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.377
Well, i... I didn't
have you number.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.523
That brazen hussy.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.860
Like a spider waiting
to devour a fly.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.261
Let me have that number.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.362
I'll take that.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.364
Like you'd know
what to do with it.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.534
Oh. I was this close to
scoring with those babes

13:56.536 --> 13:58.069
until the "Hunkins" ruined it.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.839
Sorry to ruin
your scene, Milton.

14:00.841 --> 14:01.840
You always ruin my scene.

14:01.842 --> 14:04.175
You stole Mary Beth
barber from me.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.211
Kissed her right in
front the flagpole.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.246
Milton, that was
in kindergarten.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.114
I mean, she kissed me.
I pushed her down.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.282
- Get over it.
- Oh, ho, ho.

14:11.284 --> 14:15.620
Well, the great and powerful
Kelly Hankins has spoken.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.455
You need to take
it down a notch.

14:17.457 --> 14:22.961
I will pull back the curtain
on you, you just wait and see.

14:22.963 --> 14:26.898
That's one delusional hombre.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.400
Yeah.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.410
Attention, students.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.013
Attention.

14:43.884 --> 14:44.616
Go.

14:44.618 --> 14:45.917
That's right.

14:45.919 --> 14:46.919
You know it.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.647
Attention.

15:15.649 --> 15:18.383
Is this even... attention.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.351
Hoodlum, punk, gangster.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.553
Oh, there we go.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.222
Good morning, students.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.658
Good morning, principal Miller.

15:26.660 --> 15:31.996
As many of you know, I am
Mr. Miller, the principal

15:31.998 --> 15:34.299
here at Butterhill high.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.402
And our dedicated
and respected staff

15:37.404 --> 15:39.170
would like to welcome
you back to yet

15:39.172 --> 15:43.141
another year here at
your favorite school.

15:43.143 --> 15:48.046
And we have two new
faculty members this year.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.149
As a result of the
brilliant investigative work

15:51.151 --> 15:53.952
of our very own "Butterhill
bulletin" reporter,

15:53.954 --> 15:59.023
Milton, our former
practitioner, nurse Nancy,

15:59.025 --> 16:02.226
will not be with us,
as her ankle monitor

16:02.228 --> 16:05.697
will not allow her within
200 feet of any school.

16:05.699 --> 16:12.270
In her place, I am pleased
to introduce nurse Zelda.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.356
Isn't she just foreign?

16:31.358 --> 16:38.663
Next, a man whom words
simply cannot describe,

16:38.665 --> 16:41.632
coach Franklin Dombrowski.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.307
Thank you.

16:49.309 --> 16:53.311
Oh, hey.

16:53.313 --> 16:57.115
Very inspirational.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.417
We look forward
to developing you

16:59.419 --> 17:04.589
all into responsible,
mature young adults.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.426
Settle down.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.795
People, settle.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.329
Settle.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.700
And in order to start things
off on the right foot,

17:15.702 --> 17:21.172
the school is sponsoring a
kickoff dance this Friday.

17:24.044 --> 17:27.678
And left two, three, four.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.314
Right, two, three, four.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.217
Left, two, three, four.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.686
Right, two, three, four.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.689
Left, two, three, four.

17:38.691 --> 17:41.659
Right, two, three, four.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.828
Left two, three, four.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.764
Right, two, three, four.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.268
Left, two, three, four.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.703
Right, two, three, four.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.306
Left, two, three, four.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.341
Right, two, three, four.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.477
And that's our
class for the day.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.747
I'll see you guys
net week, all right?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.215
- Awesome class, Kelly.
- Thank you.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.417
- See you at the dance tomorrow.
- I'll see you.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.251
Can't wait.

18:07.253 --> 18:11.622
Has anyone ever told you what
a sensual instructor you are?

18:11.624 --> 18:16.828
So strong, so tight,
so many muscles?

18:16.830 --> 18:21.632
You make my heart race even
when we're not exercising.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.568
That's good, I guess.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.171
So I hear your band will be
playing at the dance tomorrow?

18:27.173 --> 18:29.507
Yeah. We've been
practicing all summer.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.875
It's gonna be great.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.312
Will you have any
time for dancing?

18:34.314 --> 18:35.113
Uh, yeah.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.214
Yeah, in between songs.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.115
It'll be fun.

18:37.117 --> 18:40.785
Well, I'll be sure to
save a dance for you,

18:40.787 --> 18:45.523
and much, much more.

18:49.795 --> 18:55.266
Ditto: Mm, mm, mm, mm.

18:55.268 --> 18:55.867
Spider bait.

18:55.869 --> 18:59.770
Yeah, well, she's
gonna to starve to death.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.906
Hey, no comprendo, Ace.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.908
What are you waiting on?

19:03.910 --> 19:07.345
Board that ship
before she sets sail.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.214
Ditto, can keep a secret?

19:10.216 --> 19:11.716
What? The king of conceal?

19:11.718 --> 19:15.386
They would poke my eyes out
with toothpicks before I

19:15.388 --> 19:16.821
would give you up, man.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.522
Spill it.

19:17.524 --> 19:23.161
Lisa and I are, uh,
we're more than friends.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.496
More?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.497
Yeah.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.532
How much more?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.333
We're in love.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.801
Oh, dude!

19:30.803 --> 19:32.603
You cannot touch her.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.805
- She is the preacher's daughter.
- I know.

19:34.807 --> 19:39.677
He's gonna get god to cast
down a lightning bolt on you.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.378
I know.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.280
Look, we've been secretly
dating, all right?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.382
She's on the strictly
restricted list.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.850
Do not open to 18.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.485
Estimated time of arrival?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.187
- Eight months, six days.
- Ah.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.657
That could explain the lack of
interest in candy and company.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.724
Ouch. Oh.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.560
I'd have trouble
keeping that secret.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.663
You have trouble keeping
your underwear a secret.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.931
Oh.

19:59.933 --> 20:00.765
All right.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.899
We're going to play hit and run.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.470
When candy comes onto you, I'll
pinch hit while you run away.

20:06.472 --> 20:07.672
You're all heart, ditto.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.874
Absolutely, bud.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.776
What are friends for?

20:13.613 --> 20:20.218
Ooh, ooh.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.788
Yeah.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.992
Yeah.

20:29.561 --> 20:32.830
Ooh.

20:36.868 --> 20:42.740
Ever since she walked by,
those jeans are on my mind.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.875
It's true.

20:44.877 --> 20:49.914
Oh, it's true.

20:49.916 --> 20:50.915
I'm hooked.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.483
I'm hypnotized.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.353
She's voodoo with big blue eyes.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.688
It's true.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.459
So true.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.461
She's every thought.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.395
She's every word.

21:04.397 --> 21:07.932
If I could sleep,
I'd dream of her.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.667
I'm hit.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.035
Going down in flames.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.305
Tail spinning, and
she's to blame.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.740
I'm hit.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.575
I'm out of control.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.411
Falling in love,
falling hard you know.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.712
I'm hit.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.547
Going down in flames.

21:23.549 --> 21:26.951
Shell-shocked, and I
can't see straight.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.920
Other girls are miles below her.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.958
I'm hit, and it's game over.

21:34.626 --> 21:39.630
Nurse Zelda, may I
offer you a cup of punch?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.832
Is it spiked?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.367
No, no, no, no, no.

21:43.369 --> 21:46.370
I made it myself.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.839
Oh, pass-a-Rooney.

21:48.841 --> 21:49.707
Are you sure?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.943
My exotic blend of papaya,
mango, and the guava

21:52.945 --> 21:57.014
are temptingly delightful,
with a splash of passion fruit

21:57.016 --> 21:58.649
that will curl your toes.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.985
What?

22:00.987 --> 22:06.023
Why, principal Miller.

22:06.025 --> 22:14.025
Are you, um, trying
to seduce me?

22:16.668 --> 22:18.602
God, no.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.071
Perish the thought.

22:20.073 --> 22:26.344
I just thought you
might be thirsty.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.546
Ok, daddy.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.108
She stole my world.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.010
If only she were my girl.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.512
She's every thought.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.980
She's every word.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.016
If I can sleep,
I'd dream of her.

23:06.018 --> 23:06.751
I'm hit.

23:06.753 --> 23:12.456
She's too delicious, burning
for her bright red kisses.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.023
Got to tell her.

23:13.025 --> 23:18.562
I know I should, 'cause I'm
hit, and I'm hit for good.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.598
I'm hit.

23:31.610 --> 23:36.180
And it's game over.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.518
You guys are great.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.485
Go and take a break.

23:41.487 --> 23:43.421
We'll be right back.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.090
Ok, ladies.

23:46.092 --> 23:46.924
Get in line.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.559
The ditto Meister
is now accepting

23:48.561 --> 23:51.162
reservations for romance.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.132
How soon they forget a hero.

23:55.134 --> 23:59.703
These small town girls don't
know what they're missing.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.572
Striking out over
there, aren't you?

24:01.574 --> 24:03.174
Oh, one, two, and three.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.842
Here, drown your sorrows.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.844
Yeah, thank you.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.078
Mm.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.214
Aw, disgustamundo.

24:10.216 --> 24:10.948
There we go.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.584
Just what the doctor ordered.

24:13.586 --> 24:21.586
Some for me... eh, some for you,
some for the punch bowl too.

24:23.094 --> 24:27.164
Know what? Let's uh, lower your
standards just a little bit.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.099
There we go. Great.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.574
May I have this dance?

24:36.576 --> 24:39.543
Oh, my prince charming.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.712
Where have you been all my life?

24:45.751 --> 24:48.786
Ha, ha, all right.
Come with me.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.860
Nurse Zelda.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.028
Captain?

25:04.202 --> 25:06.937
This is very
tasty punch, indeed.

25:06.939 --> 25:13.744
I think I will have one or
two or 16 more of these.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.813
I'm happy it pleases you.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.516
I can give you
the secret recipe.

25:18.518 --> 25:24.555
Oh, well, give it to me, baby.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.757
I gots to have it.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.995
Like bear on waters skis.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.702
Nurse Zelda, do we have an ill

25:38.704 --> 25:41.639
student out there on the floor?

25:41.641 --> 25:43.908
How would I know?

25:46.845 --> 25:49.280
Bear on water skis.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.821
So what did you
think of the band?

25:57.823 --> 26:00.190
It was fine.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.035
Having a good time?

26:11.037 --> 26:12.336
Mm-hm.

26:18.009 --> 26:18.876
Really, Lisa.

26:18.878 --> 26:21.912
Let's not hog the hunk.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.756
Ditto.

27:05.758 --> 27:06.390
Ditto!

27:06.392 --> 27:09.893
You're an exquisite
dancer, and so sexy.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.295
Hit and run, ditto.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.329
Ditto, hit and run!

27:12.331 --> 27:15.099
Looks like Hankins is
moving in on your territory.

27:15.101 --> 27:19.403
Yeah, dude. He's putting a squeeze
on your grapefruits, man.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.772
Yeah, go get him.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.173
Yeah!

27:25.143 --> 27:26.744
Oh, h... hi... hi, bronco.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.312
How's algebra going?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.847
Ditto?

27:29.849 --> 27:36.854
Four, five, six, seven.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.857
Two.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.160
Oh, darn.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.029
I keep losing count.

27:45.031 --> 27:51.769
How about we take
your temperature, yes?

27:53.905 --> 27:55.339
Oh.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.010
The old fashioned way.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.681
I'm... I'm feeling
much better now.

28:03.683 --> 28:07.918
You are no fun at all.

28:10.755 --> 28:17.394
I'm going to take two aspirins,
and you call me in the morning.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.864
I've got some Booty
twerking to do.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.083
Are you all right?

28:39.085 --> 28:44.722
I'm fine. I'm surprised he didn't
break his hand on my abs of steal.

28:44.724 --> 28:45.823
What? That was funny.

28:45.825 --> 28:49.426
I'm just not much in
the mood for laughing.

28:51.029 --> 28:53.497
What's wrong, Lisa?

28:54.365 --> 28:57.000
I've got a problem.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.770
A growing problem.

28:59.772 --> 29:00.938
I don't get it.

29:00.940 --> 29:05.843
Do you prefer cloth
or disposable diapers?

29:06.945 --> 29:09.146
Are you saying that?

29:17.055 --> 29:18.956
I love you, Lisa.

29:18.958 --> 29:22.059
I love you, and
I'll love our baby.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.762
And I love you.

29:24.764 --> 29:25.896
But I'm scared.

29:25.898 --> 29:29.032
I'm scared of what
the town might think,

29:29.034 --> 29:31.535
and what all the other
kids are gonna say.

29:31.537 --> 29:39.243
And most of all, I'm scared
of what my dad's going to do.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.845
I'm scared for us.

29:41.847 --> 29:44.281
I... I just got to disappear.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.117
Lisa, you're not leaving me.

29:47.119 --> 29:47.951
Not now, not ever.

29:47.953 --> 29:52.790
I mean, sure, we made a mistake,
but everybody makes mistakes.

29:52.792 --> 29:56.994
I promise, I will come
up with something.

29:56.996 --> 29:57.561
Really?

29:57.563 --> 30:01.131
I've always wanted to be
your knight in shining armor.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.834
Just give me a chance.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.507
Excuse me.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.576
Excuse me.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.814
Nurse Zelda!

30:21.186 --> 30:24.922
I cannot unsee that.

30:29.327 --> 30:32.262
I can't believe your dad
gave you a key to this place.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.231
He didn't give me a key.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.300
I wouldn't give me a key.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.302
I forged a copy.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.372
So your dad doesn't know we
raid this place every night?

30:42.374 --> 30:44.374
Oh, sure he knows.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.043
He keeps a tab.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.945
I'm in debt for life.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.479
He doesn't kick your butt?

30:49.481 --> 30:53.550
How could you kick a
butt with a face like this?

30:53.552 --> 30:58.422
So how are you feeling after
that, uh, first round knockout?

30:58.424 --> 30:59.923
Hit and run, huh?

30:59.925 --> 31:00.891
I get hit, and you run?

31:00.893 --> 31:02.192
Your little error
almost cost me the game.

31:02.194 --> 31:09.299
That was not my fault. She
had me under some sort of spell.

31:11.135 --> 31:13.370
I promise it won't happen again.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.573
It's nothing compared to
the blow Lisa laid on me.

31:16.575 --> 31:21.144
Oh.
Ha, ha, ha, something juicy?

31:21.146 --> 31:24.915
I mean, you'll
probably find out.

31:24.917 --> 31:28.118
I mean, the whole school
will probably find out.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.122
Lisa and I are, uh...

31:32.124 --> 31:35.459
Lisa and I are
gonna have a baby.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.131
A baby what?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.233
What do you mean, a baby what?
A baby, baby.

31:43.235 --> 31:47.037
You know, a pooping,
wetting, wah, wah, wah baby.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.039
I hate to break it you, but this

31:49.041 --> 31:52.576
is gonna put a definite
strain on your dating secret.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.011
I've got to think
of something fast.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.413
I mean, if I don't, Lisa's
father's gonna ship her off

31:56.415 --> 31:57.581
to some convent in Mongolia.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.149
And I mean, I
doubt I'll be doing

31:59.151 --> 32:01.084
any pitching from a body cast.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.654
How about if we
try to disguise Lisa?

32:03.656 --> 32:05.322
That won't work.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.089
Girls always know.

32:06.091 --> 32:07.691
They have that baby sonar thing.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.159
I've got to come
up with something

32:09.161 --> 32:11.328
no one's ever going
to figure out.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.502
Man: Rapunzel?

32:18.504 --> 32:20.437
Rapunzel?

32:22.640 --> 32:25.375
Let down your long hair.

32:27.378 --> 32:28.211
Hey, uncle Theus.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.580
When did you get
the cool wheels?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.282
This morning.

32:32.284 --> 32:32.983
Heh heh.

32:32.985 --> 32:33.951
Ain't she a beaut?

32:33.953 --> 32:37.120
My other car would
make me look bad.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.690
So, uh, where's my kid brother?

32:39.692 --> 32:41.658
I need to experiment
on him again.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.560
Kelly: He took Jimmy
and mom fishing.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.462
They should be gone all day.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.563
Gadzooks.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.299
I distinctly told him I'd
be by Sunday afternoon.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.201
- Today's Saturday.
- Saturday?

32:51.203 --> 32:52.369
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.038
- Ok. What was yesterday?
- Friday.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.139
- Tomorrow?
- Sunday.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.608
What... what... what will
it be a week from today?

32:58.610 --> 33:00.577
- Saturday.
- Ah.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.013
My god, it is Saturday.
This is disastrous.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.281
Everything's ready.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.082
Ready for what?

33:05.084 --> 33:07.517
The greatest discovery
known to mankind.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.386
Greater than the wheel,
greater than flight,

33:09.388 --> 33:10.354
greater than peanut butter.

33:10.356 --> 33:14.091
Look... listen, I've discovered
how to transfer unlimited

33:14.093 --> 33:18.095
gigaflops of yowibytes directly
into the cerebral cortex,

33:18.097 --> 33:20.330
resulting in...

33:20.332 --> 33:22.366
It's really cool.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.301
Uh, maybe.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.268
Maybe?

33:25.270 --> 33:26.370
Maybe what?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.372
Well, that's why I need my...

33:28.374 --> 33:30.273
I... I need...

33:30.275 --> 33:31.575
I need your father.

33:31.577 --> 33:36.346
I need, uh, somebody
to, um, volunteer

33:36.348 --> 33:39.149
to do my experiment on.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.550
Is it painful?

33:40.552 --> 33:41.551
Oh, no, no, no, no.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.519
No pain whatsoever.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.354
Absolutely pain-free.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.591
At least none of the
mouses complained about it.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.393
I'll volunteer.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.361
- You will?
- Yeah.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.131
Oh! You'd be doing a huge
service to mankind.

33:54.133 --> 33:59.202
Not to mention boosting
your grade point average.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.271
I can never repay you.

34:01.273 --> 34:04.374
- Can I bring ditto?
- Absolutely. Yes.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.377
Let him witness
history in the making.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.445
All right.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.346
Cool.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.049
I think I have to
go to the bathroom.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.183
Oh, no.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.185
We're ready to begin.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.485
There. Ok.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.089
When I flip this switch,
you're going to become

34:19.091 --> 34:21.792
a human computer chip.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.128
Before, you put
this in your mouth.

34:25.130 --> 34:28.565
It's gonna prevent you
from biting your tongue.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.400
All right? Ok?

34:33.472 --> 34:34.471
Ok.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.172
All right.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.574
Ok. Ready?

34:37.576 --> 34:39.141
Count!

34:39.143 --> 34:44.514
Five, four, three, two, one!

34:44.516 --> 34:45.516
Blast off.

34:48.454 --> 34:53.657
Uncle Theus: Work, baby.
Work, baby.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.334
What's your name?

35:04.336 --> 35:06.369
Kelly Hankins.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.604
It worked.

35:07.606 --> 35:13.176
What's the square root of 976?

35:13.178 --> 35:14.144
I don't know.

35:14.146 --> 35:17.747
I really don't
feel any different.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.683
No new knowledge?

35:19.685 --> 35:21.518
At least I didn't lose any.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.854
Hey. What's this?

35:23.856 --> 35:26.189
Ah!

35:26.191 --> 35:27.424
Don't touch that.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.527
That is a super hybrid
of a venous fly trap,

35:30.529 --> 35:35.499
only it doesn't stop
at eating just insects.

35:37.436 --> 35:38.436
Sorry.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.237
Hey, little fellow.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.706
Hey uncle Theus, who's this?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.374
Don't.

35:44.376 --> 35:49.146
That, uh, that...
That is Adam, my most

35:49.148 --> 35:50.780
extraordinary experiment.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.616
Kelly: It looks
pretty normal to me.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.517
Oh, he is.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.153
Except for one very
important detail.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.855
He is gonna have a baby.

35:58.857 --> 36:01.591
- Adam's going to have a baby?
- Yeah.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.426
That's impossible.

36:03.428 --> 36:07.430
Well, it may not be as
crazy as you, uh, may think.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.299
There have been
dozens of documented

36:09.301 --> 36:15.372
cases of women carrying babies
in their abdominal cavities.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.707
So, why not a male?

36:17.709 --> 36:21.378
How did he even get
pregnant in the first place?

36:21.380 --> 36:24.314
Well, by tweet.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.348
Kelly: Tweet?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.516
I don't understand.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.351
Yeah, you never will understand.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.520
I barely understand myself.

36:30.522 --> 36:30.954
Tweet.

36:30.956 --> 36:35.192
Tweet, tweet stands for Theus
workable easy embryo transfer.

36:35.194 --> 36:37.861
No muss, no fuss,
no pain whatsoever.

36:37.863 --> 36:38.962
I've heard that before.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.932
Are you sure it's safe?

36:41.934 --> 36:44.301
Are you doubting
the work of a genius

36:44.303 --> 36:47.370
with double your IQ, triple his?

36:47.372 --> 36:50.307
I give you proof positive.

36:50.309 --> 36:56.413
Uncle Theus, can that
be done to a human being?

36:56.415 --> 36:59.349
Um, theoretically, yes.

36:59.351 --> 37:03.353
But you know, there
are dangers involved.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.487
What kind of dangers?

37:04.489 --> 37:08.258
Well, the... the danger that
the embryo will not attach,

37:08.260 --> 37:12.295
the danger of removing
the mature fetus.

37:12.297 --> 37:16.399
Most importantly,
the danger to the...

37:16.401 --> 37:17.267
To the carrier.

37:17.269 --> 37:23.273
Any misstep along the
way could prove fatal.

37:29.447 --> 37:30.981
- I don't know, Kelly.
- I do.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.616
- But what if...
- It won't.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.318
- Well, can you...
- I can.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.722
Is this some sort
of new teenage rap?

37:38.724 --> 37:39.856
You know, uncle Theus, you said

37:39.858 --> 37:42.993
you'd never be able to repay
me for that experiment.

37:42.995 --> 37:44.828
That's right.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.265
I know how you can repay me.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.937
What in the heck?

37:53.939 --> 37:54.938
Get out.

37:54.940 --> 37:55.872
I'm the principal.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.643
I'm the principal here.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.478
Oh.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.046
I wanted a beaver.

38:03.848 --> 38:04.481
Milton.

38:04.483 --> 38:08.485
I assume you are taking
up valuable space

38:08.487 --> 38:11.421
in my office for a reason.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.757
What have you got for me?

38:18.596 --> 38:23.333
Sucking face
in the janitors room,

38:23.335 --> 38:26.736
smoking in the lavatory,

38:26.738 --> 38:29.306
beer cans in the bushes.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.074
Having them dusted
for prints now.

38:31.076 --> 38:34.511
And spiked punch.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.680
That explains a lot.

38:36.682 --> 38:39.916
Milton, I want to commend you.

38:39.918 --> 38:47.691
Your keen sense of investigative
snitchery has reached new lows.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.426
You may now stand at ease.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.360
Ah, thank you, sir.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.730
May I say, it's an honor to
serve on board the same ship

38:53.732 --> 38:56.433
with you as her commander.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.068
Yes, you may.

38:58.636 --> 39:02.906
Again, it's an honor to
serve on board the same ship

39:02.908 --> 39:04.641
with you as her commander.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.875
Thank you.

39:05.877 --> 39:10.613
Milton, you are a
credit to your school

39:10.615 --> 39:13.950
and a valuable asset to me.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.452
I want you to step
up your efforts

39:15.454 --> 39:21.458
to uncover these offensive
everyday teenage activities.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.761
Keep your eyes open and your
ears perked for any rumor

39:24.763 --> 39:29.366
of deviant behavior.

39:32.837 --> 39:34.371
Ok.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.049
Oh, wow.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.818
This must be the horror section.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.992
If you're looking for
something to check out,

39:55.994 --> 39:57.994
try this.

39:59.563 --> 40:00.096
Mm.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.665
I'll take a dozen copies.

40:02.667 --> 40:03.600
Not here.

40:03.602 --> 40:04.534
Not right now.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.835
You're crazy.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.071
I might just be.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.806
Wait till you hear this plan.

40:09.808 --> 40:13.009
What?

40:13.011 --> 40:15.011
Shh. Ok?
It's perfect, all right?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.013
I'll have no problem
hiding 10 pounds.

40:17.015 --> 40:17.981
No one will suspect a thing.

40:17.983 --> 40:22.786
And then when school lets out
for the summer, I'll have it.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.659
Do you have any
idea how difficult

40:29.661 --> 40:30.894
it is to carry a baby?

40:30.896 --> 40:31.795
Hey, I'm a guy.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.431
I can handle it, all right?
How hard could it be?

40:34.433 --> 40:37.734
You really have no clue, do you?

40:37.736 --> 40:38.668
So what do you think?

40:38.670 --> 40:42.705
I think it's the strangest
thing I've ever heard.

40:42.707 --> 40:43.106
Yeah.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.709
Strange or not,
it's our best plan.

40:46.711 --> 40:50.780
Lisa: This doesn't look
like a doctor's office.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.115
Where are all of his diplomas?

40:52.117 --> 40:53.983
Dr. Theus and
his assistant are

40:53.985 --> 40:56.920
highly trained, respected,
dedicated professionals.

40:56.922 --> 41:00.523
Dr. Theus, I'd like
you to meet Lisa.

41:00.525 --> 41:01.124
Oh.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.893
Well, it's a pleasure to meet

41:03.895 --> 41:06.095
the mate of the
man who will mother

41:06.097 --> 41:11.968
the child that you conceived.

41:12.603 --> 41:15.605
And his assistant, Dr. Moore...

41:15.607 --> 41:16.873
Gue.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.174
Dr. morgue.

41:18.176 --> 41:18.908
Lisa.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.109
Lisa: Charmed, I'm sure.

41:20.111 --> 41:24.714
So if we are ready, we
can begin the procedure.

41:24.716 --> 41:25.548
Just one question.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.585
You have performed this
procedure before, right?

41:28.587 --> 41:30.954
Uh, yeah.
Of course, yes.

41:30.956 --> 41:34.123
In... in fact... in
fact, Adam will be

41:34.125 --> 41:36.793
watching the entire procedure.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.027
Adam?

41:38.029 --> 41:38.595
Adam.

41:38.597 --> 41:42.866
Yes, Adam, my first
transplant experiment.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.035
Lisa: A monkey?
Experiment. No.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.137
- No, no, i...
- Mellow out, babe.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.773
All right?
This will be a piece of cake.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.141
Ditto!

41:57.915 --> 42:02.619
Do I, um, still get
to apply the anesthesia?

42:13.531 --> 42:14.964
Hey.

42:16.967 --> 42:19.736
You ok in there?

42:19.738 --> 42:21.838
Can you hear me?

42:38.756 --> 42:40.790
Now look who's back.

42:40.792 --> 42:41.758
How you doing?

42:41.760 --> 42:43.159
- Kelly: Lisa?
- Oh, no.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.228
- Lisa's doin' fine.
- Kelly: Yeah?

42:45.230 --> 42:52.869
The procedure went perfectly,
and now, we just have to wait.

42:52.871 --> 42:56.339
So you get some rest.

42:56.341 --> 42:57.874
Good.

43:00.644 --> 43:01.711
Class, what you have before you

43:01.713 --> 43:03.680
are frogs that you
will be dissecting.

43:03.682 --> 43:07.150
All the materials that you
need should be on your desk.

43:07.152 --> 43:09.586
The whole thing
went as slick as snot.

43:09.588 --> 43:10.687
I was the main man, of course.

43:10.689 --> 43:12.722
But your uncle did do his part.

43:12.724 --> 43:13.122
Yeah.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.258
I don't... I don't even
feel any different.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.326
Oh, take it from me.

43:16.328 --> 43:18.962
You are, in a family way.

43:18.964 --> 43:19.762
Yeah.

43:19.764 --> 43:20.597
This is a breeze.

43:20.599 --> 43:21.965
I mean, to think,
women have complained

43:21.967 --> 43:24.367
- about this for centuries now.
- All right, class.

43:24.369 --> 43:28.204
We're ready to begin dissecting
the anatomy of a frog.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.641
It's all a big gimmick.

43:31.643 --> 43:32.609
You think?

43:32.611 --> 43:33.076
Absolutely.

43:33.078 --> 43:34.644
Girls have been lying
to guys since Eve

43:34.646 --> 43:39.048
told them Adam that there
was no worm in that apple.

43:39.050 --> 43:39.716
Yeah.

43:39.718 --> 43:41.618
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right.

43:41.620 --> 43:43.353
The first point
of order is to slice

43:43.355 --> 43:44.754
open the abdominal cavity.

43:44.756 --> 43:50.760
You are gonna blow the lid off
of this whole pregnancy scam.

43:50.762 --> 43:51.928
Liberate mankind.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.296
Herald the truth.

43:55.300 --> 43:57.934
You're just wasting
your money with that test.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.303
After all, I am an
experienced professional.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.904
Kelly: I hate to burst
your bubble, ditto,

44:01.906 --> 44:05.308
but you're only a high school
student who's flunking biology.

44:05.310 --> 44:09.412
I mean, a lot of people get
sick of the sight of blood.

44:09.414 --> 44:10.346
Frog blood?

44:10.348 --> 44:11.280
Kelly: Yeah, frog blood.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.983
Just give me a few more minutes,
and I'll let you know for sure.

44:13.985 --> 44:18.254
I am so sure, I already
got you a baby present.

44:18.256 --> 44:21.224
Kelly: What is it?

44:21.226 --> 44:22.725
A baby.

44:22.727 --> 44:23.192
What?

44:23.194 --> 44:25.428
You know, one of
those pooping, wetting,

44:25.430 --> 44:27.063
wah, wah, wah baby dolls?

44:27.065 --> 44:28.197
You'll need the practice, bro.

44:28.199 --> 44:31.401
And from the looks
of things, you

44:31.403 --> 44:33.836
might be in for a rough ride.

44:33.838 --> 44:34.837
Kelly: What do you mean?

44:34.839 --> 44:38.307
I mean, morning sickness,
muscle cramps, swollen feet,

44:38.309 --> 44:40.943
backaches, mood swings,
breakouts of acne,

44:40.945 --> 44:42.745
and tender nipples.

44:42.747 --> 44:47.250
It says here that the breasts
might increase in size.

44:50.154 --> 44:54.891
You don't suppose I'm going
to like, grow, you know?

44:54.893 --> 44:56.459
I don't know.

44:56.461 --> 44:58.227
But promise me one thing.

44:58.229 --> 45:00.096
- No.
- If you do...

45:00.098 --> 45:02.398
- Don't even go there.
- You'll let me touch them.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.733
Seriously, ditto?

45:03.735 --> 45:05.101
Is that too much to ask
from your best friend?

45:05.103 --> 45:08.004
If I had some, I'd let
you slap them around.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.305
You're hopeless.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.106
Ok.

45:10.108 --> 45:13.309
Well, what about, uh, breathing?

45:13.311 --> 45:15.078
It says here you got
to know how to breathe.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.447
Well, I've been doing
it all my life, so.

45:17.449 --> 45:20.049
Not like this, you haven't.

45:20.451 --> 45:24.721
Come over here and
lay on your back.

45:24.723 --> 45:25.388
Ok.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.890
Put one pillow under your head...

45:27.892 --> 45:28.391
All right.

45:28.393 --> 45:30.126
And one under your knees.

45:30.128 --> 45:32.495
All right.

45:32.497 --> 45:36.766
Stage one is deep
chest breathing.

45:36.768 --> 45:40.870
So in and out.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.172
In, And out.

45:43.174 --> 45:44.974
Magnificent, bro.
You got it.

45:44.976 --> 45:45.942
- Ok.
- Nothing to it.

45:45.944 --> 45:51.447
Yeah, stage two is
accelerated shallow breathing.

45:51.449 --> 45:52.115
Ok.

45:52.117 --> 45:53.516
Kelly:

45:53.518 --> 45:56.352
It's in through the nose,
out through the mouth.

45:56.354 --> 45:57.386
Kelly:

45:57.388 --> 46:00.757
Yeah, ok.
Just like that, just like that.

46:00.759 --> 46:01.791
Ready?

46:01.793 --> 46:02.792
Stage three.

46:02.794 --> 46:04.327
Pant like a dog.

46:04.329 --> 46:06.162
No, no, no.
Faster like this, like...

46:08.967 --> 46:09.932
Oh, candy.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.968
Oh, oh, candy.

46:11.970 --> 46:14.804
Oh, candy, I want to kiss you.

46:14.806 --> 46:16.305
Ok. You ready?

46:16.307 --> 46:17.340
Stage four.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.342
Stage four?

46:19.344 --> 46:21.477
Delivery breathing.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.780
Ow.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.214
Push!

46:25.216 --> 46:25.982
Come on.

46:25.984 --> 46:27.950
Keep blowing out. Push.

46:27.952 --> 46:29.519
Whoa, your dilated. Oh.

46:29.521 --> 46:30.820
What am I pushing?

46:30.822 --> 46:31.788
I don't know. Ok.

46:31.790 --> 46:33.556
Here we go.
Here we go.

46:33.558 --> 46:34.257
Nurse.

46:34.259 --> 46:35.992
Oh, you're dilated.

46:35.994 --> 46:36.793
10 centimeters.

46:36.795 --> 46:38.427
Oh, you're so strong.

46:38.429 --> 46:39.929
You're so strong.

46:39.931 --> 46:40.363
Ew.

46:40.365 --> 46:42.932
He's crowning.
Come on.

46:48.239 --> 46:51.240
Ok. Ok. Ok.

46:51.242 --> 46:55.211
We did it. You can rest.

46:56.446 --> 46:59.282
Not bad.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.285
All right. It's time.

47:02.287 --> 47:03.252
Clear means negative.

47:03.254 --> 47:06.355
Blue means all my
problems are solved.

47:13.530 --> 47:15.865
I'm a mother!

47:24.541 --> 47:25.541
Aw, gross.

47:25.543 --> 47:27.376
She looks like she
ate a bowling ball.

47:27.378 --> 47:29.979
That's because
there's a baby in there.

47:29.981 --> 47:30.580
She ate a baby?

47:30.582 --> 47:33.216
No. She's gonna give
birth to a baby.

47:33.218 --> 47:35.551
What are those weird
lines on her stomach?

47:35.553 --> 47:36.519
Those are stretchmarks.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.387
When the baby grows,
she gets stretched out.

47:38.389 --> 47:41.023
Why are you looking at
this stupid stuff anyway?

47:41.025 --> 47:43.459
Why don't you go stick
your head in the lawn mower?

47:43.461 --> 47:44.260
Cost you $1.

47:44.262 --> 47:46.963
That's a bargain,
but I don't have it.

47:46.965 --> 47:49.332
I'll put it on your tab.

47:54.571 --> 47:57.106
Dad: You got a minute?

47:57.108 --> 47:59.041
Sure. Come on in.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.309
What are you studying?

48:00.311 --> 48:03.045
Just some biology.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.914
Biology, huh?

48:04.916 --> 48:07.316
I was never very
good in biology.

48:07.318 --> 48:08.885
Never very good in
school in general.

48:08.887 --> 48:12.555
Maybe that's why I'm
so proud of you, son.

48:12.557 --> 48:14.957
Certainly can't
take credit for it,

48:14.959 --> 48:17.026
but you are one special kid.

48:17.028 --> 48:19.896
An a student, star pitcher.

48:19.898 --> 48:23.232
You never get in any trouble,
and you've never caused

48:23.234 --> 48:25.067
me to lose a night's sleep.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.536
I'm just thankful you're my boy.

48:27.538 --> 48:29.138
Well, I try my best.

48:29.140 --> 48:32.541
I know you do, son.
But all work, no play.

48:32.543 --> 48:34.143
What do you mean?

48:34.145 --> 48:35.011
What I mean is...

48:35.013 --> 48:37.947
Well, in my senior
year, it was the most

48:37.949 --> 48:39.949
memorable year of my life.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.018
You could expect the
unexpected from me.

48:42.020 --> 48:47.023
Son, just don't get bogged down
with the pressures of school.

48:47.025 --> 48:48.124
Live a little.

48:48.126 --> 48:48.925
Be unique.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.359
Do something a little crazy.

48:50.361 --> 48:55.965
In my year, I
swallowed 13 goldfish.

48:55.967 --> 48:56.499
School record.

48:56.501 --> 48:59.168
You might not want to do
something that extreme.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.070
Of course, you
couldn't cause half

49:01.072 --> 49:02.571
the stir that your old man did.

49:02.573 --> 49:08.411
By the way, I talked
to your uncle Theus.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.579
You did?

49:10.581 --> 49:11.681
Yeah.

49:11.683 --> 49:17.453
He said you two are doing
some secret science project.

49:17.455 --> 49:19.655
He did?

49:19.657 --> 49:20.423
Yeah.

49:20.425 --> 49:21.958
That's my boy.

49:21.960 --> 49:23.626
Mr. conservative.

49:27.498 --> 49:31.434
Well, it could have been a sea
that kept you in your shell.

49:31.436 --> 49:36.572
It could have been a devil
that made your life hell.

49:36.574 --> 49:42.712
It could have been...

49:44.414 --> 49:48.184
Well, it could have been a
candle I just burned too quick.

49:48.186 --> 49:52.621
It could have been a stranger
taking treats for tricks.

49:52.623 --> 49:59.996
It could have been
dangle the day on a string.

50:01.098 --> 50:06.002
Well, it could have been summer,
could have been spring.

50:06.004 --> 50:09.672
Could have been...

50:09.674 --> 50:14.143
Well, it could have been
any number of things.

50:14.145 --> 50:18.581
But everybody knows it was me.

50:19.583 --> 50:24.053
Well, it could have been...
That blew your mind.

50:24.055 --> 50:28.257
It could have been a timeshare
that stole your time.

50:28.259 --> 50:35.765
It could have been an accident
waiting to take control.

50:36.433 --> 50:41.037
Well, it could have been
a singer that just wanted a hit.

50:41.039 --> 50:45.341
It could have been a swinger
that swung and missed.

50:45.343 --> 50:52.548
It could have been
a whether or not you stay or go.

50:53.750 --> 50:57.720
Well, it could have been far.

50:57.722 --> 51:02.091
It could have been,
are you gonna pay for it all?

51:02.093 --> 51:06.562
Well, it could have been
any number of things.

51:06.564 --> 51:11.233
But everybody knows it was me.

51:13.136 --> 51:15.771
It was me.

51:17.107 --> 51:18.841
It was me.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.179
It was me.

51:24.714 --> 51:28.250
It was you.

51:29.152 --> 51:31.854
Whoo, you.

51:36.660 --> 51:39.695
Well, well, well.

51:39.697 --> 51:42.531
If it isn't lover boy.

51:42.533 --> 51:43.532
Please, bronco.

51:43.534 --> 51:44.700
I gotta go real bad.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.869
Oh, you'll go
right, to the hospital

51:46.871 --> 51:51.307
if I ever catch you putting your
dirty hands on my girl again.

51:51.309 --> 51:53.843
Please, just...
Just step aside.

51:53.845 --> 51:54.777
What was that?

51:54.779 --> 51:55.678
Step outside?

51:55.680 --> 51:59.381
You want to step outside
with me, do you loser boy?

51:59.383 --> 52:00.749
Ow.
Not the nipples.

52:00.751 --> 52:02.518
- It hurts.
- Come on.

52:02.520 --> 52:05.187
Hit me with your best shot.

52:05.189 --> 52:06.655
Pour it on me.

52:10.661 --> 52:11.527
Why you little...

52:11.529 --> 52:17.466
Do I detect the odoriferous
presence of smoking tobacco?

52:17.468 --> 52:18.734
Uh, no sir.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.836
I don't smell a thing.

52:20.838 --> 52:24.540
Me and the boys were just
talking about what a smoggy day

52:24.542 --> 52:25.641
it was, right, boys?

52:25.643 --> 52:27.543
- Absolutely.
- That's right.

52:27.545 --> 52:28.511
Yes.

52:28.513 --> 52:30.679
So smoggy, in
fact, that there is

52:30.681 --> 52:34.283
a substantial haze
curiously culminating right

52:34.285 --> 52:36.919
here in the boys' bathroom.

52:37.687 --> 52:38.521
Yes, sir.

52:38.523 --> 52:40.789
Very curious indeed, sir.

52:40.791 --> 52:42.191
Uh.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.259
Well, we better be get going.

52:43.261 --> 52:46.595
I don't want to miss any of
my algebra lessons, you know.

52:46.597 --> 52:48.731
Nice seeing you again,
principal Miller.

52:48.733 --> 52:52.701
Mm. The pleasure's
all mine, boys.

52:54.838 --> 52:56.672
Kelly Hankins.

52:56.674 --> 52:59.942
Just the person I wanted to see.

53:00.677 --> 53:01.877
I am?

53:01.879 --> 53:04.547
Yes. Yes, my boy.

53:04.549 --> 53:07.216
It has come to my
attention lately

53:07.218 --> 53:12.955
that your school work has
suffered a serious regression.

53:12.957 --> 53:16.692
Well, my grades
have dipped a little.

53:16.694 --> 53:17.293
Dipped?

53:17.295 --> 53:21.363
Boy, they've crashed harder
than a bull rider's bottom.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.698
I'm sorry, sir.

53:22.700 --> 53:27.670
Kelly, in a class full
of chronic under-achievers,

53:27.672 --> 53:31.507
you have always been
the one bright spot.

53:31.509 --> 53:37.746
The only honor student among
a multitude of mental pygmys.

53:37.748 --> 53:39.682
Confide in me.

53:39.684 --> 53:43.352
Tell me, what's wrong?

53:43.354 --> 53:44.587
Nothing, sir.

53:44.589 --> 53:46.589
A social problem, perhaps?

53:46.591 --> 53:49.992
You know, quite often,
such a dramatic reversal

53:49.994 --> 53:53.429
is the result of a
lack of self-esteem,

53:53.431 --> 53:59.635
the perception that
there's something abnormal,

53:59.637 --> 54:04.773
that you don't quite fit in.

54:04.775 --> 54:06.742
You're not suicidal, are you?

54:06.744 --> 54:07.376
No, sir.

54:07.378 --> 54:08.744
Well, see to it that you're not.

54:08.746 --> 54:11.280
I would hate to have
my school tarnished

54:11.282 --> 54:12.948
by your thoughtless act.

54:12.950 --> 54:18.420
Still, I have this intuition
that there's something

54:18.422 --> 54:21.423
peculiar you're hiding from me.

54:21.425 --> 54:24.493
I can't quite put
my finger on it,

54:24.495 --> 54:26.829
but rest assured,
sooner or later, you

54:26.831 --> 54:30.966
will not be able to hold
it inside you any longer,

54:30.968 --> 54:35.337
and it will burst out of you.

54:35.339 --> 54:37.373
I'm sure it will, sir.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.541
May I go back to class now?

54:39.543 --> 54:42.478
You're dismissed.

54:59.963 --> 55:03.399
180, that's 35...

55:03.401 --> 55:05.067
35 pounds in six months?

55:05.069 --> 55:07.403
I mean, I was only
supposed to gain 10

55:07.405 --> 55:09.405
pounds the whole nine months.

55:09.407 --> 55:10.939
Stop gorging, you Oinker.

55:10.941 --> 55:14.376
Cut down on the chow or else.

55:14.378 --> 55:15.544
Oh!

55:15.546 --> 55:17.713
What the?

55:27.557 --> 55:28.857
Oh!

55:28.859 --> 55:30.993
He kicked.

55:30.995 --> 55:33.395
Hey, can you hear me in there?

55:33.397 --> 55:35.931
Listen, that's quite
a kick you got there.

55:35.933 --> 55:39.501
I mean, you could
make all state.

55:39.503 --> 55:42.404
What if you're a girl?

55:42.406 --> 55:44.940
You can still make all-state.

55:44.942 --> 55:47.476
People may laugh
and point at you.

55:47.478 --> 55:48.344
Trust me, I know.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.846
You might feel
scared or deserted.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.915
But I'll always
be there for you.

55:52.917 --> 55:55.851
I wouldn't do this
for just anyone.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.720
You're special.

55:57.722 --> 56:00.556
If want to sock me one
day because of all this,

56:00.558 --> 56:03.959
I understand.

56:03.961 --> 56:05.094
I just want to meet you.

56:05.096 --> 56:09.565
I promise I'll do anything
to make that happen.

56:09.567 --> 56:14.570
By the way, forget that crack
about cutting down on the chow.

56:14.572 --> 56:18.841
You're gonna need all your
strength to play football.

56:20.944 --> 56:22.478
Yeah.
It was disgusting.

56:22.480 --> 56:23.612
Who would do that?

56:23.614 --> 56:25.914
I have no idea.

56:25.916 --> 56:27.416
Oh, my gosh.

56:27.418 --> 56:29.785
Look at this.

56:32.021 --> 56:34.790
Have you ever seen a
more pitiful sight?

56:34.792 --> 56:38.127
He's gone from hot to so not.

56:38.129 --> 56:39.728
Girl: From cool to fool.

56:39.730 --> 56:44.867
Girl: From super
athletic to Mr. pathetic.

56:46.503 --> 56:48.504
Well, Lisa?

56:48.506 --> 56:53.075
Oh, from hunk to junk.

56:54.545 --> 56:55.144
Nice.

56:55.146 --> 56:56.845
Freakazoid warning
at 12 o'clock.

56:56.847 --> 57:01.617
Let's get out of here
before he contaminates us.

57:01.619 --> 57:03.085
Pure awesomeness.

57:03.087 --> 57:05.988
This one's going viral.

57:05.990 --> 57:08.424
Hey, wait.

57:20.136 --> 57:20.969
Hey, stranger.

57:20.971 --> 57:22.204
I haven't seen
much of you lately.

57:22.206 --> 57:25.974
Speaking of stranger,
that's what you're becoming

57:25.976 --> 57:28.177
more and more of every day.

57:28.179 --> 57:29.611
What do you mean?

57:29.613 --> 57:31.914
I mean, everyone
is talking about you.

57:31.916 --> 57:34.149
What happened to only
gaining 10 pounds?

57:34.151 --> 57:36.618
You've become the joke
of the entire school.

57:36.620 --> 57:39.588
I don't care what
everyone else thinks.

57:39.590 --> 57:40.589
What do you think?

57:40.591 --> 57:42.090
I don't know, Kelly.

57:42.092 --> 57:45.127
Part of me thinks you're this
special guy for doing this,

57:45.129 --> 57:51.200
but part of me says,
stay clear, danger zone.

57:51.202 --> 57:53.035
Stay clear?
Danger, really?

57:53.037 --> 57:56.138
You're right about one thing, Lisa.
I am a special guy.

57:56.140 --> 57:59.475
I risked it all for you, and
I'll do the same for our baby,

57:59.477 --> 58:00.776
with or without you.

58:00.778 --> 58:03.245
The decision's yours.

58:09.052 --> 58:12.154
That's it.
Get those legs up.

58:12.156 --> 58:12.921
Keep it going.

58:12.923 --> 58:16.258
All right.
All right.

58:16.260 --> 58:18.694
We're gonna do some toe touches.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.162
All right.

58:20.164 --> 58:25.067
One, two, three.
All right.

58:25.069 --> 58:26.068
That's it.

58:26.070 --> 58:27.069
That's a great class.

58:27.071 --> 58:30.506
I'll... I'll see you next month.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.114
You know, I don't know.

58:39.116 --> 58:42.551
I just don't have the
motivation to work out anymore.

58:42.553 --> 58:46.054
Yeah. You and about a
hundred other people.

58:51.561 --> 58:52.194
Face it, Ace.

58:52.196 --> 58:54.196
You've lost it, that
spring in your step,

58:54.198 --> 58:58.967
the fantastic frame,
the pulsating pelvis.

58:58.969 --> 58:59.601
Gone.

58:59.603 --> 59:01.103
That's not all I've lost.

59:01.105 --> 59:02.738
Lisa and I broke up.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.172
Oh no.

59:04.174 --> 59:06.041
Another abandoned
teenage mother.

59:06.043 --> 59:10.312
Just another sad statistic
in this depraved society.

59:10.314 --> 59:14.216
What are you gonna do?

59:14.218 --> 59:15.918
I don't know, ditto.

59:15.920 --> 59:16.985
I'm just so confused.

59:16.987 --> 59:22.157
I... I don't know who I
am or even what I am.

59:22.159 --> 59:25.260
I know exactly how you feel.

59:25.262 --> 59:27.329
When I started this thing, it...

59:27.331 --> 59:28.263
It all felt so right.

59:28.265 --> 59:29.965
I mean, nothing else
in the world mattered.

59:29.967 --> 59:33.569
Then when Lisa broke
up with me, it just...

59:33.571 --> 59:35.571
I don't know if I
can continue on.

59:35.573 --> 59:38.907
Hey, cheer up, guy.

59:41.845 --> 59:43.779
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

59:43.781 --> 59:46.915
At least it can't
get much worse, huh?

59:52.689 --> 59:54.022
I got fired.

59:54.024 --> 59:55.724
I got fired.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:02.097
Important information for you.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.832
Before you play
baseball, there's

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:06.168
one thing you must
do before you're

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.737
gonna be eligible to play.

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:11.006
And that's a physical.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.107
We have a great nurse.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.175
She's a new nurse.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:14.376
Her name is Zelda.

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:16.044
Really knows her medicine.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.146
But once you pass
the physical, yay,

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:19.915
you're ready to be a bloodhound.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:20.616
You know?

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:21.717
It's just part of the game.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:23.619
Just part of the game,
part of the process.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:26.822
So I'd like for you all
to take a deep breath.

01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:27.689
Everybody.

01:00:27.691 --> 01:00:31.059
Ok. Now get up on your
feet, and exit this way

01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.728
through the medical building.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.162
Go ahead.

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.764
Atta boy.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:36.798
Way to go, guys.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.299
Way to go.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:40.769
Please answer
following questions

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:44.373
to best of your knowledge.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.775
- Age?
- 18.

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:48.677
- Height?
- Kelly: 5 foot 8.

01:00:48.679 --> 01:00:53.048
- Weight?
- A little over 160.

01:00:56.419 --> 01:01:03.125
Must we weigh
you on scale naked?

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:07.195
187.4 pounds, exactly.

01:01:09.432 --> 01:01:16.371
Have you been experiencing
any of following?

01:01:16.373 --> 01:01:23.445
Unusual aches, pains,
sudden weight gain,

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:27.683
coordination
difficulties, nausea,

01:01:27.685 --> 01:01:30.919
incontinence, breathing
irregularities,

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:33.121
emotional distress?

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.022
No!

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.290
All right.

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.694
Remove shirt.

01:01:38.696 --> 01:01:41.463
I... I'm a little shy.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.271
Hot damn!

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:52.407
That is biggest one of
those I've ever seen.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.243
Do you want me to
put my shirt back on?

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:59.448
No, no, no.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:00.382
No.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:04.820
I am professional after all.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.726
Where should we put this?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.295
Ok.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.438
That is strange.

01:02:23.806 --> 01:02:29.111
I think I hear two heartbeats.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:34.149
That's because, um,
my heart beats twice

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.518
as fast when I'm around you.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:44.860
Well, you are a
sweet talker, you.

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:46.428
Yes.

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:56.872
You know, I could be charmed
into becoming cougar

01:02:56.874 --> 01:02:59.441
for you, little lion cub.

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:03.478
You're out of my league.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:10.118
Well, you'll let me know

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.290
when you graduate to the majors.

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.127
Gas.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:24.199
Do you want my
professional medical opinion?

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:25.000
I guess?

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:30.305
My professional opinion is

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.407
you're pregnant.

01:03:33.409 --> 01:03:34.910
Pregnant.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:41.449
You know, boo,

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:46.855
The look on your face.

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:50.492
To think that I quit
being a stand-up comedian

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:51.827
to become nurse.

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:52.829
Yes.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:10.912
Hey, candy.

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:12.314
Thanks for coming
to support the team.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.083
I came to support my
knight in shining armor.

01:04:15.085 --> 01:04:18.620
Thanks.
I... I appreciate it.

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:19.454
You seem down.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:23.258
I just... I haven't
really been myself lately.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.927
Well, I've got a
little surprise for you,

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:30.365
something to help you
warm up before the game.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:31.166
What's that?

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:34.536
A knight always carries a
piece of his damsel's clothing

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:35.637
into battle.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:38.373
Would you do that for me?

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.408
I guess so.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:41.610
What are you...

01:04:41.612 --> 01:04:44.512
How's that for inspiration?

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.948
Um, i... I got to go.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:47.649
Ok?

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:49.351
Batter up.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:53.922
Play ball.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:56.024
Let's go.

01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:58.193
Batter up.

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.028
Whoo.

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:03.498
Your glory days are now a haze.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.234
Your feet just fall behind you.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:12.374
You're trying to recapture
that old thrill.

01:05:12.376 --> 01:05:16.945
When you trip and fall
and drop the ball,

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:20.081
it's suddenly a reminder.

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:25.320
The spirit's strong
but your body's gone downhill.

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:27.989
Now you're awake,

01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:33.395
but it seems you've only been
a legend in your dreams.

01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:39.634
And talent really never
got you very far.

01:05:39.969 --> 01:05:42.637
'Cause you can't hit,
field, or throw.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:46.241
But if there was one thing
you should know,

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:51.212
you're just a washed-up,
broke-down subpar superstar.

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:57.686
You know you are,
subpar superstar.

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.625
- Time.
- Time out.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.493
This clown's crowding the plate.

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:08.363
Give him the brush-back pitch.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.472
Better suck it up.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.375
This one's coming
down the inside.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:25.413
Boy: Take your base.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:29.451
Hey! Hey! He threw at him.

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:30.752
Hey! Hey!

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:31.686
You ordered a beat ball.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.188
I should have ordered a pizza.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.724
When you talk to my
team, talk with respect.

01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:38.560
That's not a Butterhill hound.
That's a hippo.

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:39.561
That's a hippo?

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:41.029
You really think that's a hippo?

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:43.131
You don't know what's.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.336
Knock it off.

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.118
Play ball.

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:09.024
But miracles are rare
and that's the truth.

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.194
Now you've fallen to the curse.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:17.098
It's so sad
you're getting worse.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:22.670
Father time made you
just the way you are.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:26.041
Well, it's time for you to quit.

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:29.711
You've got to give it up.
You've got to admit.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:35.583
You're just a washed-up,
broke-down subpar superstar.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:40.622
Come on!

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:44.225
Come on!

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:49.097
You're out.

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:50.198
You're out.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:54.469
You're out too.

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:10.752
That was the worst
exhibition of sissy ball

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.220
I have ever witnessed.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:15.657
Cowell, what kind
of a tag is that?

01:08:15.659 --> 01:08:16.291
Arnelli?

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:19.560
My mother can field
better than you.

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:20.428
And Hankins.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.264
Hankins, there are no words
to describe your performance.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:28.236
I came to school, and they told
me to expect something big.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:31.406
But I didn't expect
it to be your stomach.

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:33.441
Good lord, man, you
throw like a girl.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.376
Have you looked in
the mirror lately?

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:40.747
You're starting to grow
female accessories.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.617
You, up, now.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.759
Are you wearing these now?

01:08:51.761 --> 01:08:53.261
Where did you get it?

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.529
No, sir.
I'm not.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:56.397
Well, I'm a good coach.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.700
I'm gonna give them back to you.
Have a seat.

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.401
Sure. Thank you.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.337
Well, you're going to pay.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.706
Every one of you
is going to pay.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.674
There is no Mr. nice guy.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:09.243
This honeymoon is over.

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:10.310
I want a divorce.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.348
Where is your bloodhound pride?

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:14.883
I want everybody
to hit the showers

01:09:14.885 --> 01:09:18.586
and wash that miserable
performance off your bodies.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:21.656
Hankins, I want you to get down
here and give me 20 push-ups.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.758
That'll keep you
busy for two hours.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.359
Right here.
No, right here.

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:25.894
Right here.

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.595
There you go, buddy.
Ok.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:28.630
Go.
Right now.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:29.731
Up, up, up, up, go.

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:30.932
Shower time.
Go.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:34.368
Go, run!

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:36.537
Oh, I love baseball.

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:50.484
How the mighty have fallen.

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:51.953
Go away, Milton.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:52.620
Or what?

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:55.557
You're gonna jump
up and run me down?

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:56.691
Hm? I think not.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:02.664
I've watched you run and jump
today, and oh, it's pitiful.

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:05.233
Simply pitiful.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.602
What's going on with you anyway?

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.737
Come on.

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:10.505
You can tell me.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:13.441
We've been buds
since kindergarten.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:14.242
Buds?

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.878
I think not.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.913
All right.

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:19.781
Be that way.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:25.687
But uh, the nose knows
something is going on,

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:30.959
and I will be your
worst nightmare.

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:37.665
196?

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:38.933
I don't believe this.

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:42.370
Stretch marks.

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:43.304
Stretch marks!

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:44.005
Jimmy, quiet.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:46.307
You're going to have a baby.

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:47.475
Jimmy, no.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:48.776
Get off my face.

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:50.445
You're killing me.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:52.947
I can't breathe.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:54.549
Then keep quiet.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:56.751
Ok, ok.

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:59.020
I saw it in your book.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.922
You're going to have a baby.

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:02.290
It's not what you think.

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.958
I, uh, I ate a bowling ball.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.959
- What?
- No, no.

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:06.461
It was, uh, it was
a science project,

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.396
and they pumped my
stomach full of air.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.365
You know, like a balloon? See?

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:13.868
It's just that mom and
dad can't know, all right?

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.870
It's secret, you understand?

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:18.006
All I understand is cash.

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:21.276
And boy, this is gonna
take plenty of it.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.610
I'm broke.
What do you want from me?

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.846
I mean, give me a break.
I'll do anything.

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:25.780
Anything you want.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:26.981
I want collateral.

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:27.982
Take my goldfish.

01:11:27.984 --> 01:11:29.784
I don't want your goldfish.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.486
Kelly: Then what?

01:11:31.488 --> 01:11:34.989
I want your car.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:37.058
- What?
- You heard me.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:37.825
I want your car.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.861
It's the only thing you own
that's worth a nickel to me.

01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:43.765
I want to hold onto it
until you pay off your debt.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:44.766
But that's blackmail.

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:47.402
I mean, you can't make me
pay ransom on my own car.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:48.703
I'll wring your
neck, you little...

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:50.805
- Mom, dad.
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.074
I can, and I will.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:55.310
Keys, please.

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.745
How am I supposed to get around?

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:58.646
Maintain my image?

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:01.482
Come on, where's
your brotherly love?

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:04.452
Yeah, a guy's
lost without wheels.

01:12:04.454 --> 01:12:05.486
Don't worry, bro.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.556
I won't leave you hanging.

01:12:26.076 --> 01:12:28.076
I got...
I got it. I got it.

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.511
Listen, dude,
this ain't working.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:32.714
Do you want me to
cut the spin out?

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:35.683
It's not the spin
that needs to be cut.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:36.984
It's the spinner.

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:37.785
What are you saying?

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.987
Are you going to cut me
out of the band I started?

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:41.789
Well, like, it's just this year,

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.658
we have a good shot
of playing the prom,

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.027
but the kids have
got to vote us in.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:46.694
And well...

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.664
Yeah, right now, I'm
the one holding you back.

01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.566
- Maybe if we practice more.
- No, no.

01:12:51.568 --> 01:12:55.870
It's just not something
you can practice out of.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:04.812
What is this stuff?

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:09.684
I'm pretty sure it's just
growing new stretchmarks.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.699
Hello?

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:25.767
Hey, stranger.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:26.634
Lisa.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:27.435
Oh, god, Lisa.

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:30.071
It's so good to hear your voice.

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.706
I've missed yours too.

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.875
Can we meet some time to talk?

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.411
Absolutely.
Anytime, anywhere, right now.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:39.847
Ok. Bell tower, 15 minutes?

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.015
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:44.786
And Lisa... I love you.

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:51.659
I'll say I'm sorry
for the third time.

01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:52.827
I mean it now.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:56.764
I swear I'll change my ways.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:05.706
And I feel so small
from the weight of it all.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:13.080
Without you, girl,
I reach for you more than ever.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.684
Lisa!

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.125
Lisa!

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.587
Oh, you're soaked.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.490
Take off this sweatshirt.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:03.064
Here. Put this on.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.065
It'll keep you warm.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.166
Won't your father...

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:06.634
He'll never know.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:11.839
Besides, I have a
confession to make.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.976
Well, this is the right place.

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:18.846
Tell me child, what is your sin?

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:19.981
Hm.

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:23.284
I have made a boy pregnant.

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:26.687
Do you plan to
do the right thing?

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.923
Yes, I do.

01:15:28.925 --> 01:15:30.992
I want my baby back.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:31.959
What?

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.861
I want my baby back.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:35.863
This isn't working, Kelly.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:39.901
It was a crazy idea
to even begin with.

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:42.303
Speaking of crazy
ideas, Lisa, I'm eight

01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:43.538
and a half months pregnant.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.206
You don't just switch
a baby back and forth.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:46.974
- Well, you switched it with me.
- That was different.

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:50.244
It was just a little speck
then, and now it's a monster.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:53.014
Don't you call
my baby a monster.

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:54.949
If anybody here is
a monster, it's you,

01:15:54.951 --> 01:15:58.686
you crazy Sci-Fi experiment.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:01.756
You're breaking all
the laws of nature,

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.658
and I want my baby back.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.626
Yeah?
Well, you can't have it.

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:06.294
I know my rights.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:09.830
Possession's 9/10ths of the
law, and I'm possessed, baby.

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:13.100
You need professional help.

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:19.140
You're violating my
inalienable rights...

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.576
Life, Liberty, and the
pursuit of childbearing.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.044
I'll take you to
the supreme court.

01:16:23.046 --> 01:16:25.813
I'll sue for
maternity, paternity,

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:26.981
custody, and lustody.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:28.983
You've lost it, big time.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.885
Every night, I lay
in bed, and my legs

01:16:30.887 --> 01:16:32.219
cramp like burnt pretzels.

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:33.955
My back feels like
a linebacker hit me,

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:35.923
and my feet hurt so bad, I'd
rather walk over hot coals.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:39.160
And what do I get in reward
for all my pain and suffering,

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:41.629
I get to throw up every
night into the toilet.

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:46.100
I've lost my car, my job, my
body, my friends, my grades.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:49.737
How can anyone in their right
mind give up all that again?

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:50.304
Never, never.

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.707
Give me pregnancy,
or give me death.

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:54.809
You've cracked.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:02.783
Lisa.

01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:09.857
Lisa!

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.127
Lisa!

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:14.829
Lisa!

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:20.735
Lost is where I'll be
unless midnight drive.

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:26.974
Without knowing
where I'm going...

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:29.110
What?

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.945
It's dad.
Breakfast is ready.

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:31.912
I'm not hungry.

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:34.181
Am I hearing correctly?

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:36.183
Did you say you weren't hungry?

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:36.851
Yeah.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:40.855
I'm just trying to
lose a few pounds.

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.791
What's that you're working on?

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:45.693
- Just a song.
- For whom?

01:17:45.695 --> 01:17:47.094
The band that you
no longer belong to?

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:49.030
For anyone, I guess.

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:51.832
I just... I seem to
write some of my best

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:52.933
stuff when I'm feeling down.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.936
Kelly, son, if you need
to talk about something,

01:17:55.938 --> 01:18:00.041
you know the old man is
a pretty good listener.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:00.841
Yeah.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:04.245
Thanks, dad, but I just...

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.880
I can't.

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:06.447
All right.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:10.151
But when you're ready,
I'll be here, son.

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:11.786
Thanks, dad.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:12.753
I love you.

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:13.387
I love you too.

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:17.992
If you change your mind,
food's out in the kitchen.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:27.201
I can't wait until tomorrow.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.035
Why tomorrow?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.804
Because I get better
looking every day.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:33.140
I mean, is this the
ultimate or what?

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:35.976
- You're looking good.
- Good?

01:18:35.978 --> 01:18:36.711
I rock.

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.746
What girl could
resist this eye candy?

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:41.882
Does this meet with
your approval, sir?

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.751
Uh, nah.

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.986
It's... it's not quite me.

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:49.156
I need something more.

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:54.128
What about my friend here?
What could you fix him up with?

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:56.097
Heh. A circus.

01:18:57.934 --> 01:18:58.966
I mean something to wear.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.737
Something stylish, but
also down to earth.

01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.138
A tent maybe.

01:19:07.944 --> 01:19:08.776
Come on, Kelly.

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:11.078
This isn't the only
tux shop in town.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:20.154
Let's try in here.

01:19:20.156 --> 01:19:21.222
Are you crazy?

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:22.923
That's for pregnant women.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:25.226
Hey, you're halfway home.

01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:26.761
Come on.

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.535
Dude. Dude.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.470
50% off.

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.776
Take a little looksy here.

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:43.444
Just relax. You know?

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.245
Ah.

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.247
How do they... how do they feel?

01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:50.518
Get your minds out of the
gutter and your filthy paws

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.486
off the delicates.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.790
Um, sorry, sir.

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.294
We were just looking for mom.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.195
I'm mom.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:02.429
Of course, you are.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:06.433
And how long until
you're expecting?

01:20:06.435 --> 01:20:07.434
Expecting what?

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:14.542
Expecting the, um, next
shipment of bras and panties

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:15.943
to come in?

01:20:15.945 --> 01:20:18.078
Tell me you're not
here for the panties.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.916
Actually, we're just
looking for some formal wear

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:24.118
suitable for a dance.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.319
Preferably with some pants.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.021
Uh, couldn't imagine it without.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:30.324
See? I told you we came
to the right place.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:33.527
Would this be for your mother?

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:35.062
Sister?

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:37.264
- Mother.
- Sister.

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:40.568
I see.
How far along is she?

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.903
She's pretty far.

01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:45.372
How big is she?

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.473
Pretty big.

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:50.344
I would have to have more
precise measurements, ok?

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:51.912
Then, um, take fatso here.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:56.550
He's pretty close to what my
mom, his sister looks like.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:21:02.323
I can't resist
seeing where this goes.

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:03.858
Move.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.060
Come here, fatso.

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:09.129
Ok.

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:11.565
Here we go.

01:21:14.436 --> 01:21:16.904
Wow.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:19.306
Um.

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:23.310
Let me see what I
have in the back.

01:21:23.312 --> 01:21:24.578
Wow.

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:27.581
My mother, your sister?

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:28.515
I mean, seriously?

01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:30.484
Dude, let's just
get out of here.

01:21:30.486 --> 01:21:31.352
Just chill, man.

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.988
We're making definite progress.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:35.623
Yeah.

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.595
You're in luck.

01:21:41.597 --> 01:21:44.498
My debutante dress.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.132
Yes.

01:21:45.134 --> 01:21:47.134
- No.
- Yes, it's stunning.

01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:49.370
It's not really
what I had in mind.

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:51.572
Well, let's not be
hasty in our decision.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:55.609
I think this outfit has a lot
of interesting possibilities.

01:21:55.611 --> 01:22:01.582
I mean, to be fairly judged, I
think you've got to try it on.

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:02.549
What?

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:03.951
Sales rep: Go for it.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:08.689
Certainly, to be sure of
the fit and match and so on.

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:12.159
The dressing rooms
are to your right.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:15.095
Oh, I'm getting my camera.

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:17.631
Let's just see how it looks.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:19.967
No one will ever know.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:33.314
Ravishing.

01:22:33.316 --> 01:22:34.181
Simply ravishing.

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:36.617
Why, if I didn't already
have a date, I would...

01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:37.418
Stop it, ditto.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:42.122
Um, I mean, I've got
to say, it is stunning,

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.459
but I'm not gonna do it.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.060
What?

01:22:46.062 --> 01:22:48.529
I'm not wearing this to prom.

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:53.233
Vandalous juvenile delinquents.

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:58.539
If I ever find out who's
responsible for this, oh lord,

01:22:58.541 --> 01:22:59.974
bring forth your
righteous indignation

01:22:59.976 --> 01:23:04.979
and turn him into a
pillar of salt.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:07.614
Daddy?

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:10.651
Lisa, sweetheart,
what are you doing here?

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:11.518
Nothing.

01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:14.488
I just sort of had
this question that's

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.689
been bothering me for a while.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.558
Well, of course, of
course, you can always...

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.129
You can always come
to me for the answers.

01:23:22.131 --> 01:23:24.031
So, speak up.

01:23:24.033 --> 01:23:25.766
What is it?

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:27.234
- Speak.
- Ok.

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:29.136
- Just speak.
- Ok, um.

01:23:29.138 --> 01:23:30.037
Speak up.

01:23:30.039 --> 01:23:35.676
Well, what if there's this
person who's doing a huge favor

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:39.646
for someone, even though it's
causing him a lot of suffering

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:43.017
to do it, should
the person receiving

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:47.621
the favor come forward and
confess, even though she

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.490
may be horribly murdered?

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:55.629
You know, I see right through
this charade, young lady.

01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:56.764
- You do?
- Oh, yes.

01:23:56.766 --> 01:24:01.402
I can just imagine the fine mess
you've gotten yourself into.

01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:02.302
You can?

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:08.108
Lisa, kids have the same
problems today as they

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:09.143
did when I was growing up.

01:24:09.145 --> 01:24:10.611
I... I know you think
you're the only person

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:15.616
in the world this has
happened to, but I assure you,

01:24:15.618 --> 01:24:16.483
you're not.

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:21.622
Lisa, the same thing happened
to me when I was a teenager.

01:24:21.624 --> 01:24:23.657
- It did?
- Mm-hm. Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:28.495
I still remember doing all of
those extra homework papers

01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:31.498
for my friends so they
too would get good grades.

01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.132
What?

01:24:32.134 --> 01:24:34.401
That's it, right?
Homework?

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:35.302
What? I...

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:39.306
Lisa, you are so kind.

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:40.507
You are so giving.

01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:42.476
Don't let people take
advantage of you.

01:24:42.478 --> 01:24:46.780
My advice to you,
tell your friends

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.649
to do their own homework.

01:24:48.651 --> 01:24:52.486
Sure, daddy. I will.

01:24:52.488 --> 01:24:53.554
Just know i...

01:24:53.556 --> 01:24:56.824
I always have the
answers for you.

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:01.195
Take care, sweetie.

01:25:01.197 --> 01:25:03.831
Let them do their homework.

01:25:03.833 --> 01:25:07.334
Oh, kids today.

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:10.337
One crisis after another.

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.710
What the?

01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:18.712
Git, git, git, git.

01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:25.586
Milton, this better be good.

01:25:25.588 --> 01:25:27.221
Ooh.

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:37.764
Interesting.

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:43.437
Very interesting, Milton.

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.205
You may stand at ease.

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:45.839
Thank you, sir.

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:49.476
I can tell there is
something quite extraordinary

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.577
about Kelly Hankins.

01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:52.846
I've compiled several
pages of behavior

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:56.750
which are extremely suspicious.

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:59.753
I believe that some
snitch-worthy material

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:02.356
will pop out on him very soon.

01:26:02.358 --> 01:26:03.790
Excellent work, Milton.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:06.326
See to it that you're
there to uncover the story.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:10.631
I will have no scandal in
my school go unexposed.

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:13.700
What are you going
to the prom for anyway?

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:17.738
You're too fat to dance, and
you haven't even got a date.

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:18.772
I'm going for the principle.

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:21.408
You have a date
with principal Miller?

01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:22.176
No, stupid.

01:26:22.178 --> 01:26:24.578
I'm going because I won't
let anyone or anything

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.246
stop me from doing what I want.

01:26:26.248 --> 01:26:27.781
Kelly Hankins runs his own race.

01:26:27.783 --> 01:26:31.852
Kelly Hankins is too fat
to walk, much less run.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:35.322
Where'd you get that
screwball outfit from anyway?

01:26:35.324 --> 01:26:37.724
The costume store.
It was only tux that fit.

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:39.426
Now come over and
help me with my shoes.

01:26:39.428 --> 01:26:42.496
I want to make sure my
outfit doesn't clash.

01:26:55.343 --> 01:27:01.281
Beware of the man
whose middle name is danger.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:02.349
Danger.

01:27:02.351 --> 01:27:08.689
He has no friends, no,
he couldn't be stranger.

01:27:08.691 --> 01:27:09.790
So be warned.

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:16.697
You mess with the shadow,
you mess with our town.

01:27:16.699 --> 01:27:17.364
Bye-bye.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:23.470
Mess with the shadow,
he's gonna take you down.

01:27:23.472 --> 01:27:26.607
Whoa yeah, you're gone.

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:30.477
You're going down.

01:27:42.992 --> 01:27:46.460
All out of excuses

01:27:46.462 --> 01:27:52.833
'cause I've never,
no, I've never been so wrong.

01:27:52.835 --> 01:27:57.537
All those things
I should have said,

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:59.640
the noise fills my head

01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:06.313
and how I miss,
miss your sweet song.

01:28:06.315 --> 01:28:07.681
Tell me...

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:15.322
How long, how long,
how long will your name

01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:18.992
leave me in pieces?

01:28:18.994 --> 01:28:23.864
Tell me how long, how long,

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:31.471
how long till your heart
gets mine completely?

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.508
How long?

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.843
Hey, principal
Miller, nurse Zelda.

01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:41.882
Heyo, Buenos
noches, senor Hankins.

01:28:41.884 --> 01:28:42.716
Meow.

01:28:42.718 --> 01:28:45.652
You're looking quite
festive this evening.

01:28:45.654 --> 01:28:46.687
Ay caramba.

01:28:46.689 --> 01:28:49.756
Would you like some
punch, nurse Zelda?

01:28:49.758 --> 01:28:53.060
That sounds mouthwatering.

01:29:03.706 --> 01:29:08.342
So sure we were forever.

01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:12.746
Was I wrong?
Was I confused?

01:29:12.748 --> 01:29:18.819
You see I lost my way
and I lost my faith.

01:29:18.821 --> 01:29:23.890
Yeah, I lost everything
when I lost you.

01:29:23.892 --> 01:29:24.825
Exquisite threads, my man.

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:28.862
I'm totally envious of how
well your tie and shoes match.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:30.464
You look pretty good too, ditto.

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.866
It's just a little
spur of the moment thing

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:34.000
that I threw together.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:39.906
Uh, did you recognize
the glorious creature

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:41.108
that walked by?

01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:42.042
No.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:43.377
What glorious creature?

01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:48.849
The one with the
big pink orchid.

01:29:48.851 --> 01:29:49.850
Yeah?

01:29:49.852 --> 01:29:51.918
Guess I didn't notice.

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.622
Well, every other jockstrap
neanderthal in here did.

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:57.124
It's Lisa.

01:29:57.126 --> 01:29:58.425
You remember?

01:29:58.427 --> 01:29:59.159
Your ex?

01:29:59.161 --> 01:30:01.128
Previous passion?

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:05.532
She's looking kind of
sickly, don't you think?

01:30:05.534 --> 01:30:06.967
Sickly?

01:30:06.969 --> 01:30:07.934
Sure, Kel.

01:30:07.936 --> 01:30:10.470
She's falling apart without you.

01:30:10.472 --> 01:30:11.805
Hey, Debbie.

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:13.740
Deb... Debbie.

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:16.176
Why don't you take
this poor, sad soul out

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:19.045
onto the dance floor and
check for signs of life?

01:30:19.047 --> 01:30:21.681
There you... ok.
Attagirl.

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:23.550
Thank you, Debbie.

01:30:23.552 --> 01:30:24.651
Nurse?

01:30:25.187 --> 01:30:29.923
The shadow,
he never makes a sound.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:30.690
No, no.

01:30:30.692 --> 01:30:36.062
Never see the shadow
until he takes you down.

01:30:36.064 --> 01:30:43.937
Whoa yeah, you're gone,
you're going down.

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.775
- You guys sound great.
- Thanks, Kelly.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:51.211
Sorry you couldn't
be a part of this.

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:53.113
I was hoping for
old time's sake,

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:59.219
that you guys would just
play this song with me?

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:04.691
Sure.

01:31:04.693 --> 01:31:05.759
Yeah, ok.

01:31:12.934 --> 01:31:19.739
Do you know how it feels?

01:31:19.741 --> 01:31:24.878
Do you know what it's like?

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:32.052
Nothing goes how it's planned.

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:37.858
No one's left on your side.

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:45.165
I keep waiting for you
to come back around.

01:31:45.167 --> 01:31:52.672
I keep on trying to figure out,

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.975
where did I go wrong?

01:31:54.977 --> 01:31:58.945
How did this happen?

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:01.848
Where did we go wrong?

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:06.753
My whole world is crashing.

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:10.824
If you love me
like you said you did,

01:32:10.826 --> 01:32:13.827
then how'd we get to this?

01:32:13.829 --> 01:32:16.129
Where did I go wrong?

01:32:16.131 --> 01:32:21.735
Where did we go wrong?

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:27.173
I thought we wanted the same.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:34.681
Maybe you're just too scared.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:41.955
I try and handle the pain,

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:48.028
but guess you want it that way.

01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:55.635
I keep on waiting for
you to come back around.

01:32:55.637 --> 01:33:02.075
I keep on trying to figure out,

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.811
where did I go wrong?

01:33:04.813 --> 01:33:09.182
How did this happen?

01:33:09.184 --> 01:33:11.751
Where did I go wrong?

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:15.589
My whole world is crashing.

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:22.862
If you love like you said you
did, then how'd we get to this?

01:33:22.864 --> 01:33:25.732
So where did I go wrong?

01:33:25.734 --> 01:33:30.737
Where did we go wrong?

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.607
I will be here even
though you're scared

01:33:33.609 --> 01:33:40.780
and treat me this way, 'cause
I said I'll always love you,

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:46.252
and that won't ever change.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:49.055
Where did I go wrong?

01:33:49.057 --> 01:33:52.959
How did this happen?

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:55.762
Where did I go wrong?

01:33:55.764 --> 01:33:59.699
My whole world is crashing.

01:33:59.701 --> 01:34:07.073
If you love me like you said you
did, then how'd we get to this?

01:34:07.075 --> 01:34:10.777
So where did I go wrong?

01:34:10.779 --> 01:34:17.050
Where did we go wrong?

01:34:21.857 --> 01:34:26.092
Attention, attention, students.

01:34:26.094 --> 01:34:27.894
Attention.

01:34:27.896 --> 01:34:30.163
Settle down, people.

01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:30.997
Settle down.

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.966
Well, I trust we
are all enjoying

01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:36.870
the evening like
responsible, mature adults.

01:34:38.674 --> 01:34:43.810
At this time, it is
my honor to announce

01:34:43.812 --> 01:34:46.713
this year's valedictorian.

01:34:46.715 --> 01:34:52.118
Now, um, we always
take into consideration

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.389
the grades and contributions
throughout all four years

01:34:56.391 --> 01:34:57.390
here at Butterhill high.

01:34:57.392 --> 01:35:03.063
And while this particular
individual may have crashed

01:35:03.065 --> 01:35:07.801
and burned late in
the year, the award

01:35:07.803 --> 01:35:10.804
still goes to Kelly Hankins.

01:35:14.009 --> 01:35:16.843
Uh, congratulations,
Kelly and we

01:35:16.845 --> 01:35:21.047
look forward to hearing
your words of wisdom

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:24.017
at the graduation ceremonies.

01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:27.821
And now, the backward dance.

01:35:27.823 --> 01:35:32.292
So ladies, grab a partner
other than your own.

01:35:32.294 --> 01:35:33.093
Woo! Woo!

01:35:33.095 --> 01:35:37.030
Raise the... the thing.

01:35:44.973 --> 01:35:48.074
You're my choice, lover boy.

01:35:48.076 --> 01:35:50.110
What are you doing?

01:35:50.112 --> 01:35:51.244
Hey, bronco.

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.480
Don't look now, but there's
a bee on your flower.

01:35:53.482 --> 01:35:54.748
Yeah, man.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:57.951
Looks like he's trying to get
some honey for his stringer.

01:35:57.953 --> 01:35:59.452
Yeah.

01:36:03.924 --> 01:36:09.395
Something poked me.

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:11.498
Ditto?

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.299
You perverted slime.

01:36:13.301 --> 01:36:14.934
Ditto!

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:16.936
He's... he's...

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:18.004
He's what?

01:36:18.006 --> 01:36:20.373
He is pregnant.

01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:22.342
That's right.

01:36:22.344 --> 01:36:26.346
Kelly Hankins is
gonna to have a baby.

01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:38.525
Hey, come on.

01:36:38.527 --> 01:36:40.193
Extra, extra.

01:36:40.195 --> 01:36:41.294
Read all about it.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:43.096
Baby boom at Butterhill high.

01:36:43.098 --> 01:36:46.299
How does it feel to
be Milton's mamaboy?

01:36:46.301 --> 01:36:49.369
He's probably after
the Pulitzer prize.

01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:50.570
I mean, can you believe this?

01:36:50.572 --> 01:36:54.174
Can you believe the slanderous
things he's saying about me?

01:36:54.176 --> 01:36:55.842
They're all true, aren't they?

01:36:55.844 --> 01:36:56.910
That's besides the point.

01:36:56.912 --> 01:37:00.446
I mean, he doesn't have to
make it sound so unusual.

01:37:00.448 --> 01:37:02.949
Yeah, he takes an ordinary story

01:37:02.951 --> 01:37:04.818
and tries to sensationalize it.

01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:07.086
Are you ever planning to
visit the outside world again?

01:37:07.088 --> 01:37:11.291
'Cause if you're not, I sure
could use your baseball mitt.

01:37:11.293 --> 01:37:13.026
Just because a guy likes
to spend a couple of days

01:37:13.028 --> 01:37:14.961
alone in his room
doesn't mean that he's

01:37:14.963 --> 01:37:16.362
looking to join a monastery.

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:21.334
And besides, I like spending
time with, uh, my goldfish.

01:37:21.336 --> 01:37:24.170
Yeah, that goldfish
is the only social life

01:37:24.172 --> 01:37:26.206
you'll be seeing for a while.

01:37:26.208 --> 01:37:29.142
Sorry to interrupt your date.

01:37:29.144 --> 01:37:31.044
Don't forget about the mitt.

01:37:31.046 --> 01:37:32.345
Yeah.

01:37:36.918 --> 01:37:39.285
You can't have my
mitt, you vulture.

01:37:39.287 --> 01:37:43.189
I really wasn't
interested in your mitt.

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:44.624
But maybe your car.

01:37:44.626 --> 01:37:46.025
Sorry, dad.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.126
Too late.

01:37:47.128 --> 01:37:53.199
I just had a long talk
with your uncle Theus,

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:54.968
and he told me everything.

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:59.639
Son, I've never had a reason
to be anything other than proud

01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:02.976
of you, and I want you to
know that that still stands.

01:38:02.978 --> 01:38:07.180
But dad, aren't you ashamed
when you walk down the street

01:38:07.182 --> 01:38:09.249
and people point and
whisper, there goes

01:38:09.251 --> 01:38:10.450
the father of that mamaboy?

01:38:10.452 --> 01:38:12.252
Eighth wonder of the world.

01:38:12.254 --> 01:38:13.186
Freak of nature.

01:38:13.188 --> 01:38:14.220
Is that what you think?

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:17.323
Son, that couldn't be
further from the truth.

01:38:17.325 --> 01:38:20.627
The man upstairs, he asked
you for a big favor, one

01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:26.566
with tremendous sacrifice,
and you haven't let him down.

01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:28.568
And you've never let me down.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:31.905
Just, it's a lot more difficult

01:38:31.907 --> 01:38:33.006
than I thought it would be.

01:38:33.008 --> 01:38:36.376
I mean, I could never imagine
doing this a second time.

01:38:36.378 --> 01:38:37.377
Mothers are amazing.

01:38:37.379 --> 01:38:39.412
Aren't they, though?

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:43.249
The family's going to be
going to church this morning.

01:38:43.251 --> 01:38:44.150
Will you be joining us?

01:38:44.152 --> 01:38:46.286
I'm pretty sure if I
showed my face at church,

01:38:46.288 --> 01:38:47.921
reverend weld
would go ballistic.

01:38:47.923 --> 01:38:51.124
I mean, I must have broken every
religious rule in the book.

01:38:51.126 --> 01:38:54.260
Ah. I've never been a fan
of religious rules.

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:56.162
Do this, do that,
do this, do that.

01:38:56.164 --> 01:39:00.466
By the time you're done, you're
nothing but a big doo doo.

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:03.403
Look, we don't have
all the answers, son.

01:39:03.405 --> 01:39:04.370
But I do know this.

01:39:04.372 --> 01:39:08.141
God, he has a plan
and a purpose for you.

01:39:08.143 --> 01:39:11.344
And no matter what you
go through in life,

01:39:11.346 --> 01:39:14.147
you need not be afraid,
because all things

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:16.015
work together for good.

01:39:16.017 --> 01:39:18.151
God's got your back.

01:39:18.153 --> 01:39:19.953
So do I.

01:39:19.955 --> 01:39:21.187
Thanks, dad.

01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:25.224
Life just seems a lot
less scary inside my room.

01:39:27.027 --> 01:39:28.561
You know, Kelly,
you could probably

01:39:28.563 --> 01:39:31.331
live in your room for
the rest of your life,

01:39:31.333 --> 01:39:34.300
and nothing bad would
ever happen to you.

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:37.470
But then again, son,
nothing good would

01:39:37.472 --> 01:39:40.039
ever happen to you either.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.181
Mm.

01:39:51.118 --> 01:39:55.154
Buon appetito, furry
little pregnant friend.

01:39:55.156 --> 01:39:59.192
Uncle Theus has
made your favorite...

01:40:00.728 --> 01:40:02.996
Oh.

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:06.299
Oh.

01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:17.571
Choir: Onward Christian
soldiers marching as to war.

01:40:18.712 --> 01:40:21.447
With the cross of Jesus...

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:31.024
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

01:40:31.026 --> 01:40:31.557
You think?

01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:33.459
Reverend weld's going to
give you so much heat,

01:40:33.461 --> 01:40:37.130
I'm going to melt just
sitting next to you.

01:40:37.132 --> 01:40:40.633
Maybe I should just
wait outside, you know?

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:50.109
Choir: Onward Christian
soldiers, marching...

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:25.278
My dear brothers and
sisters, throughout the ages,

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:28.514
god has taught us
many lessons, but none

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:32.819
more dramatic than
the judgment that

01:41:32.821 --> 01:41:37.290
follows perverse immorality.

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:43.362
In the times of the pharaohs,
god brought forth great plagues

01:41:43.364 --> 01:41:45.264
upon the Egyptian people.

01:41:45.266 --> 01:41:47.733
And in Sodom and
Gomorrah, he devastated

01:41:47.735 --> 01:41:48.868
with fire and brimstone.

01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:52.472
And in the time of Noah, he
destroyed the whole world.

01:41:52.474 --> 01:41:55.875
God will damn the wicked.

01:41:55.877 --> 01:42:01.814
Now it is our duty as
god-fearing Christian soldiers

01:42:01.816 --> 01:42:08.221
to terminate the indecency,
to eradicate the vermin that

01:42:08.223 --> 01:42:11.224
shame us before
our maker, to seek

01:42:11.226 --> 01:42:12.892
and destroy all that is unholy.

01:42:12.894 --> 01:42:20.233
Now me, I am a mild-mannered,
peace-loving person,

01:42:20.235 --> 01:42:24.837
but I have to tell
you, my blood boils

01:42:24.839 --> 01:42:27.840
when I start to see how
some of our young people

01:42:27.842 --> 01:42:31.777
are keeping company with
the prince of darkness.

01:42:31.779 --> 01:42:32.411
Yeah.

01:42:32.413 --> 01:42:35.148
They are dancing with the devil.

01:42:35.150 --> 01:42:38.184
They are playing rock
music with the devil.

01:42:38.186 --> 01:42:39.819
They are sleeping
with the devil.

01:42:39.821 --> 01:42:43.623
And now, they have
fornicated with the devil.

01:42:43.625 --> 01:42:47.260
One of our very own has
sold his soul to Satan,

01:42:47.262 --> 01:42:51.330
and now he is carrying
Satan's child.

01:42:51.332 --> 01:42:52.465
Now, wait a minute, reverend.

01:42:52.467 --> 01:42:54.567
No, there is no minute to wait.

01:42:54.569 --> 01:42:57.203
We must exorcise the
demon from within.

01:42:57.205 --> 01:43:01.707
Good Christian soldiers,
bring the lost soul forward.

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.509
Hold on to tight, boys.

01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:06.579
Remember how strong
the demon is possessed.

01:43:06.581 --> 01:43:08.447
- Daddy, wait.
- Oh, Lisa.

01:43:08.449 --> 01:43:09.882
I'm so glad you're here, honey.

01:43:09.884 --> 01:43:11.350
Please just hold
his head like that.

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:14.954
You know, make sure it
doesn't start spinning around.

01:43:16.558 --> 01:43:17.323
I call upon you.

01:43:17.325 --> 01:43:21.460
In the name of god,
be gone, Satan.

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:24.931
Please release him
from eternal damnation.

01:43:24.933 --> 01:43:28.935
I need the help of the
whole congregation.

01:43:28.937 --> 01:43:33.539
Please, Satan, go back to hell.

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:34.874
Go back to hell.

01:43:34.876 --> 01:43:37.577
Congregation: Go back to hell.

01:43:37.579 --> 01:43:38.978
Go back to hell.

01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.881
Go back to hell.

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:44.350
Go back to hell.

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:53.693
Go back to hell!

01:43:53.695 --> 01:43:55.428
Oh, god.

01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:58.331
Please, show us you've heard.

01:43:58.333 --> 01:43:59.966
Bring us a miracle.

01:43:59.968 --> 01:44:03.002
Give us a sign.

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:05.805
Holy crap.

01:44:05.807 --> 01:44:07.540
Son of a bitch.

01:44:10.444 --> 01:44:11.477
A sign.

01:44:11.479 --> 01:44:12.979
It's a sign.

01:44:12.981 --> 01:44:16.449
Did... did did... you
get the message?

01:44:16.451 --> 01:44:18.017
Hm? Did you get
the message?

01:44:18.019 --> 01:44:20.987
It's... you don't
have to be afraid.

01:44:20.989 --> 01:44:24.690
You don't have to be
afraid of... of god.

01:44:24.692 --> 01:44:26.559
You don't have to
be afraid of Satan.

01:44:26.561 --> 01:44:29.328
You don't have to be afraid
of your neighbors or people

01:44:29.330 --> 01:44:30.029
far away from you.

01:44:30.031 --> 01:44:31.330
Look, I'm just a scientist.

01:44:31.332 --> 01:44:32.531
I'm not a religious person.

01:44:32.533 --> 01:44:38.404
But I know that
god, right, is love.

01:44:38.406 --> 01:44:40.573
He loves you.

01:44:40.575 --> 01:44:42.842
He loves you and you.

01:44:42.844 --> 01:44:49.782
And I suppose god
even loves you.

01:44:52.786 --> 01:45:00.786
But right now, god loves
Kelly Hankins most of all.

01:45:01.428 --> 01:45:08.301
If that's how god feels,
who are we to disagree?

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:17.343
How you doing?

01:45:17.345 --> 01:45:18.577
You ok?

01:45:18.579 --> 01:45:19.312
Come on.

01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:20.079
Let's get out of here.

01:45:20.081 --> 01:45:23.649
This place gives me
the heeby jeebs, man.

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.956
I haven't been in
there in 20 years,

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:32.825
and I'm gonna give
it another 20.

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:34.560
Thanks for the
rescue, uncle Theus.

01:45:34.562 --> 01:45:36.662
I mean, you're a life saver.

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:39.732
Or a taker.

01:45:39.734 --> 01:45:40.866
What?

01:45:40.868 --> 01:45:41.801
Better you should see.

01:45:41.803 --> 01:45:44.537
I'll show you. Come on.
Let's go.

01:45:44.539 --> 01:45:46.038
You're not going to
make me be a Guinea

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.810
pig in one of your
experiments again, are you?

01:45:50.812 --> 01:45:52.111
What's wrong?

01:45:52.113 --> 01:45:55.114
What's wrong?

01:45:55.116 --> 01:45:55.981
Everything.

01:45:55.983 --> 01:46:03.689
I've put you in gave danger,
all to satisfy my curiosity.

01:46:03.691 --> 01:46:07.626
But I'm... I'm fine.

01:46:07.628 --> 01:46:09.729
For how long?

01:46:14.434 --> 01:46:19.605
We are in uncharted territory.

01:46:19.607 --> 01:46:24.110
We must end the experiment.

01:46:24.112 --> 01:46:27.546
What if I don't want to?

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:32.118
The consequences
could be unthinkable.

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:37.456
Look, the decision is yours.

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:44.463
I need some time alone.

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:57.710
Reverend weld and
crowd: Go back to hell.

01:46:57.712 --> 01:46:59.512
Go back to hell.

01:46:59.514 --> 01:47:00.579
Go back to hell.

01:47:00.581 --> 01:47:02.648
He has sold his soul to Satan.

01:47:02.650 --> 01:47:03.649
Lisa: You've cracked.

01:47:03.651 --> 01:47:05.985
Reverend weld and
crowd: Go back to hell.

01:47:05.987 --> 01:47:08.554
Go back to hell.

01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:43.622
- Kelly.
- Get out of here.

01:47:43.624 --> 01:47:45.124
Hit me with your best shot.

01:47:45.126 --> 01:47:46.625
It'll burst out of you.

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:48.594
One bad decision after the next.

01:47:48.596 --> 01:47:49.528
You stop that.

01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:54.099
You can't get away
from me that easily.

01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:11.650
Mama.

01:48:22.196 --> 01:48:24.964
Mom: Kelly, you about ready?

01:48:24.966 --> 01:48:27.833
I pressed your gown, and...

01:48:27.835 --> 01:48:33.606
Kelly, you're still in bed.

01:48:33.608 --> 01:48:34.740
I'm just not feeling too good.

01:48:34.742 --> 01:48:39.144
But dear, it's graduation
day, and the whole family...

01:48:39.146 --> 01:48:44.083
I'm sorry, mom. I just... I
don't think I can make it.

01:48:44.085 --> 01:48:45.117
Jeff?

01:48:45.119 --> 01:48:49.054
Kelly's not feeling very well.

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:53.058
Rough night, son?

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:53.926
A nightmare.

01:48:53.928 --> 01:48:55.794
Your mother says you're sick.

01:48:55.796 --> 01:48:59.732
No, not really.
I'm just scared.

01:48:59.734 --> 01:49:00.866
Guess I'm just a coward.

01:49:00.868 --> 01:49:02.902
I mean, I've been praying
to make this all go away,

01:49:02.904 --> 01:49:07.306
but I just don't think
god listens to me.

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:16.282
God listens.

01:49:16.284 --> 01:49:19.985
He just doesn't always say yes.

01:49:19.987 --> 01:49:23.789
Kelly, even the best
starting pitcher

01:49:23.791 --> 01:49:27.560
occasionally needs a reliever
to come in and take over.

01:49:27.562 --> 01:49:29.929
Son, maybe you've
been holding that ball

01:49:29.931 --> 01:49:31.830
too tight for too long.

01:49:31.832 --> 01:49:34.900
Why don't you put
that in god's hands

01:49:34.902 --> 01:49:38.270
and let him decide
the next pitch?

01:49:38.272 --> 01:49:40.005
Trust him.

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:41.707
All right, dad.
I will.

01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:44.009
But we're gonna need a
miracle to win this one.

01:49:44.011 --> 01:49:46.178
Well, you just
happened to be in luck,

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:50.349
son, because god is in
the miracle business.

01:49:50.351 --> 01:49:54.787
And if you don't want to go
to graduation, it's all right.

01:49:54.789 --> 01:49:58.724
The ones that love you,
they'll understand.

01:49:59.893 --> 01:50:02.161
Now is there anything
I can get you?

01:50:02.163 --> 01:50:04.797
On your way out
there, you might want

01:50:04.799 --> 01:50:06.665
to stop by a travel agency.

01:50:06.667 --> 01:50:08.867
Pick up a ticket for Africa.

01:50:08.869 --> 01:50:09.268
One way.

01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:14.340
Business or coach?

01:50:14.342 --> 01:50:17.943
First class.

01:50:18.913 --> 01:50:20.813
Sandra L. Paxen.

01:50:25.219 --> 01:50:28.153
Kelly R. Hankins.

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:35.694
Not present.

01:50:35.696 --> 01:50:38.364
I don't blame him
for not showing up.

01:50:38.366 --> 01:50:45.904
It's all my fault. Just a
moment of temporary insanity.

01:50:45.906 --> 01:50:48.073
Candice J. Cotton.

01:50:53.714 --> 01:50:55.748
Ditto Moore.

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:05.391
We did it. We did it!

01:51:05.393 --> 01:51:07.693
Milton Vanderblack.

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:26.145
Bartholomew b.
Winterbottom, III.

01:51:31.752 --> 01:51:34.219
Lisa G. Weld.

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:50.436
Ladies and gentlemen, I
present to you our graduating

01:51:50.438 --> 01:51:53.272
class of Butterhill high.

01:51:57.078 --> 01:52:00.212
At this time, we
would normally hear

01:52:00.214 --> 01:52:03.315
from our class valedictorian.

01:52:03.317 --> 01:52:07.286
However, due to
unforeseen circumstances,

01:52:07.288 --> 01:52:10.389
this year's speaker
is not present.

01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:13.959
In his place, I
would like to comment

01:52:13.961 --> 01:52:18.931
on these fine, responsible,
mature young adults.

01:52:21.435 --> 01:52:25.104
You need to see a
doctor, young lady.

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:31.443
As these leaders of
tomorrow begin their journey

01:52:31.445 --> 01:52:33.846
through the maze
of life, they will

01:52:33.848 --> 01:52:39.418
find their most memorable
years were spent with me

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.319
here at Butterhill high.

01:52:40.321 --> 01:52:47.359
I molded them and painstakingly
shaped them into what

01:52:47.361 --> 01:52:50.863
I believe will be this...

01:52:50.865 --> 01:52:57.770
Gen... generations next,
uh, Kelly Hankins.

01:52:57.772 --> 01:53:02.141
I mean, it looks
like Kelly Hankins,

01:53:02.143 --> 01:53:07.846
our class valedictorian,
is with us after all.

01:53:07.848 --> 01:53:08.547
I don't know how...

01:53:08.549 --> 01:53:14.520
So, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
your valedictorian,

01:53:14.522 --> 01:53:17.422
Mr. Kelly R. Hankins.

01:53:21.796 --> 01:53:27.800
Thank you, principal Miller,
for those inspiring words.

01:53:28.101 --> 01:53:32.037
I would now like to give
my valedictorian speech.

01:53:32.039 --> 01:53:37.142
Friends and relatives,
teachers and fellow students,

01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:39.878
today we leave the safety of the
lives we've known as Butterhill

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:41.580
high school students,
and we venture

01:53:41.582 --> 01:53:45.184
into the world of uncertainty
and possibilities.

01:53:45.186 --> 01:53:48.987
We will face challenges the
likes of which we could have

01:53:48.989 --> 01:53:51.590
never dreamed, and the
way in which we respond

01:53:51.592 --> 01:53:54.827
will be forever embedded
into our character.

01:53:54.829 --> 01:53:59.231
Any great challenge will
initially scare you to death...

01:53:59.233 --> 01:54:04.469
Fear of failure,
ridicule, embarrassment,

01:54:04.471 --> 01:54:08.340
fear of losing friends,
fear of losing loved ones,

01:54:08.342 --> 01:54:11.276
and fear of death.

01:54:11.278 --> 01:54:14.146
Do not be afraid to
go out on a limb,

01:54:14.148 --> 01:54:15.581
because that is
where the fruit is.

01:54:15.583 --> 01:54:21.253
You must learn and grow by
doing what you are afraid of.

01:54:21.255 --> 01:54:22.621
I was recently enslaved by fear.

01:54:22.623 --> 01:54:28.327
It robbed me of my joy, stole
precious moments of my life,

01:54:28.329 --> 01:54:30.929
and chipped away
at my character.

01:54:30.931 --> 01:54:33.432
Fear let me down a path
of destructiveness,

01:54:33.434 --> 01:54:36.602
and nearly convinced me
to destroy another's.

01:54:36.604 --> 01:54:39.104
Fear held its hand to
the throat of possibly

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:44.543
the next great theologian,
or dedicated educator,

01:54:44.545 --> 01:54:47.145
or future hall of fame athlete.

01:54:47.147 --> 01:54:51.416
President Roosevelt once told
us we have nothing to fear

01:54:51.418 --> 01:54:52.184
but fear itself.

01:54:52.186 --> 01:54:56.221
And I for one will no longer
bow to the influence of fear.

01:54:56.223 --> 01:54:59.057
And it is my hope that
you will stand up and join

01:54:59.059 --> 01:55:02.094
me in facing your fears.

01:55:02.096 --> 01:55:06.398
And though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.967
I will fear no...

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:18.210
I will fear no...

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.914
No, um...

01:55:25.019 --> 01:55:27.152
I will fear no...

01:55:28.322 --> 01:55:29.087
Kelly.

01:55:29.089 --> 01:55:32.557
It's time. I'm time.

01:55:32.559 --> 01:55:35.661
Kelly. Stage four. Stage four.

01:55:35.663 --> 01:55:37.963
Breathe.

01:55:50.944 --> 01:55:52.644
Kelly: I must be dead.

01:55:52.646 --> 01:55:54.680
I see an angel.

01:55:54.682 --> 01:55:56.381
No, Kelly.

01:55:56.383 --> 01:55:59.384
It me, Lisa.

01:55:59.386 --> 01:56:01.420
Kelly: Same thing.

01:56:01.422 --> 01:56:04.623
What happened?

01:56:04.625 --> 01:56:06.558
You collapsed.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:09.962
We nearly lost you.

01:56:10.964 --> 01:56:13.966
Where's my baby?

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:26.378
Congratulations, mom.

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.113
It's a boy.

01:56:28.115 --> 01:56:30.248
A boy.

01:56:30.717 --> 01:56:32.150
He's perfect.

01:56:32.152 --> 01:56:35.053
No horn-rimmed
glasses or anything.

01:56:35.055 --> 01:56:37.990
Nothing could ever top this.

01:56:37.992 --> 01:56:41.727
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:53.238
This one's a girl.

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.775
A girl?

01:56:56.777 --> 01:56:57.442
Two?

01:56:57.444 --> 01:57:00.612
How am I ever gonna
to handle two?

01:57:00.614 --> 01:57:04.282
How are we going to?

01:57:04.284 --> 01:57:05.584
We?

01:57:05.586 --> 01:57:08.320
I told my father about us.

01:57:08.322 --> 01:57:11.123
You did?

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:14.359
I'm sorry everything
turned out so bad.

01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:15.794
Bad?

01:57:15.796 --> 01:57:18.030
No, no.

01:57:18.032 --> 01:57:20.365
Everything turned out good.

01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:25.670
Now I know how much my
father really loves me.

01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:28.740
You're my hero.

01:57:28.742 --> 01:57:34.679
And from now on, I'm not gonna
be scared of anyone or anything

01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:38.050
as long as I have you.

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:45.357
Can you get up?

01:57:45.359 --> 01:57:45.824
Yeah.

01:57:45.826 --> 01:57:48.560
There's something
I want to show you.

01:58:32.405 --> 01:58:34.873
All the way!

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:57.229
They're all behind you...

01:58:58.831 --> 01:59:02.734
Letting you know
you made the right choice.

01:59:11.145 --> 01:59:13.545
They love you, Kelly.

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:16.548
What about you?

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:20.919
Well,

01:59:20.921 --> 01:59:25.857
I've got a
heavy hankering for you...

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:29.361
Kelly Hankins.

01:59:54.720 --> 02:00:00.458
I'm praying for the answers

02:00:00.460 --> 02:00:02.727
to these questions.

02:00:02.729 --> 02:00:07.699
These sleepless nights
go on and on.

02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:11.870
I feel like running away
from the truth,

02:00:11.872 --> 02:00:14.873
ignoring everything I know

02:00:14.875 --> 02:00:20.312
and everyone or everyone I love.

02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:35.760
I was just a boy,
I didn't know any better.

02:00:35.762 --> 02:00:39.464
Thoughts of my future
and all its demons.

02:00:39.466 --> 02:00:43.435
In life now I search
for constant reason

02:00:43.437 --> 02:00:47.939
to get out of my bed.

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:53.545
Listen to the voice
inside my head.

02:00:53.547 --> 02:00:54.879
They're trying to tell me to

02:00:54.881 --> 02:00:57.682
cope with all these
different standards.

02:00:57.684 --> 02:00:59.784
Playing life
to please the crowd.

02:00:59.786 --> 02:01:03.421
It's hard when there's
too much to handle.

02:01:03.423 --> 02:01:06.825
Hope to turn this life around.

02:01:06.827 --> 02:01:12.364
In light you will find me.

02:01:12.366 --> 02:01:17.369
Hold on tight through the night.

02:01:17.371 --> 02:01:20.772
I am yours.

02:01:23.342 --> 02:01:24.809
Take me back home.

02:01:24.811 --> 02:01:30.315
Safely I'll go back to my bed
with these thoughts of anger.

02:01:30.317 --> 02:01:34.552
'Cause you're still spinning
around my head.

02:01:34.554 --> 02:01:37.522
You know it's true.

02:01:37.524 --> 02:01:39.724
I'm not...

02:01:39.726 --> 02:01:42.527
Round and round,
it's plain to see.

02:01:42.529 --> 02:01:45.530
This road I'm on is killing me.

02:01:45.532 --> 02:01:48.533
Cope with all these
different standards,

02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:50.602
playing life
to please the crowd.

02:01:50.604 --> 02:01:54.039
It's hard when there's
too much to handle.

02:01:54.041 --> 02:01:57.676
Hope to turn this life around.

02:01:57.678 --> 02:02:03.081
In light you will find me.

02:02:03.083 --> 02:02:07.686
Hold on tight through the night.

02:02:07.688 --> 02:02:08.820
I am yours.

02:02:08.822 --> 02:02:14.392
In light you will find me.

02:02:14.394 --> 02:02:18.863
Hold on tight through the night.

02:02:18.865 --> 02:02:21.766
I am yours.

02:02:42.988 --> 02:02:48.093
In light you will find me.

02:02:48.095 --> 02:02:52.063
Hold on tight through the night.

02:02:52.065 --> 02:02:56.968
I am yours.
I am yours.

02:02:56.970 --> 02:03:02.507
In light you will find me.

02:03:02.509 --> 02:03:06.911
Hold on tight through the night.

02:03:06.913 --> 02:03:08.413
I am yours.

02:03:08.415 --> 02:03:13.618
In light you will find me.

02:03:13.620 --> 02:03:17.756
Hold on tight through the night.

02:03:17.758 --> 02:03:20.158
I am yours.

02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:24.929
In light you will find me.

02:03:24.931 --> 02:03:29.734
Hold on tight through the night.

02:03:29.736 --> 02:03:32.737
I am yours.

02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:36.674
You'll never understand
what you do to me.

02:03:36.676 --> 02:03:39.944
Just one touch, feel your heart
beating next to me.

02:03:39.946 --> 02:03:46.084
'Cause I've been waiting for
so long just to see you leave.

02:03:46.086 --> 02:03:47.786
So don't leave me.

02:03:47.788 --> 02:03:50.955
Trust me, baby,
I'll be your everything.

02:03:50.957 --> 02:03:54.192
Just one kiss, one smile,
girl, you make me sing.

02:03:54.194 --> 02:04:00.665
'Cause I've been waiting for
so long just to see you leave.

02:04:00.667 --> 02:04:03.034
So don't leave me.

02:04:17.116 --> 02:04:21.786
'Cause I'm crazy for you.

02:04:21.788 --> 02:04:25.924
Yeah.
