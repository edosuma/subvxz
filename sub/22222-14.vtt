WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:06.128
Pilot:
If you keep moving out of the
planet's shadow, we'll lose contact entirely.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.628
Crichton:
Can't be helped, Pilot. Solar
flares are what I came to see.

00:09.719 --> 00:11.300
Holy mother.

00:11.387 --> 00:12.923
That's a wormhole.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.300
Aeryn:
It looks unstable.
And it's pulling us in.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.256
Full reverse thrusters.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.266
Crichton:
Guys, I might have just
found a way home.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.143
Look, you're going to have
to speed up the repairs.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.440
What for?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.483
I got to get back up there.
I'm collecting data.

00:28.571 --> 00:32.155
Furlow:
The ability to create a stable
wormhole travel

00:32.241 --> 00:36.325
through space and time
would be incredibly...

00:36.412 --> 00:38.152
Profitable.
-Probably.

00:38.247 --> 00:41.239
l'|l download you a copy of the
data as soon as | get back
aboard the ship.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.541
Exclusive rights,
or there's no deal.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.289
The data.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.462
You made me think you
were my father!

00:50.092 --> 00:52.879
Jack:
We brought you here to
recreate your memory.

00:52.970 --> 00:56.212
Why not just make a wormhole
to take you to Earth?

00:56.307 --> 00:57.592
That would use all our
remaining power.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.345
Crichton:
Show me what you
really look like.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.064
Jack/Alien:
Many of us hoped that Earth
might be our welcoming place.

01:06.150 --> 01:10.143
But the highest life form
on the planet is also the
most destructive.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.229
Your humans would kill us.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.563
So what will you do now?

01:13.658 --> 01:15.899
We continue searching
for a home.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.780
Jack:
These equations are necessary
for creating a wormhole.

01:18.871 --> 01:21.203
You cannot access this
data consciously.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.372
You won't remember this
part of our encounter.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.496
The unconscious knowledge we've
given you will guide you.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.830
Scorpius:
Oh, the Ancients were
here first, implanting the wormhole knowledge I seek.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.008
But when my Aurora Chair failed
to unlock that information,

01:34.095 --> 01:37.007
I had to implement a
second strategy.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.884
Crichton:
You put something in my head.

01:38.975 --> 01:41.842
Scorpius:
A very sophisticated neurochip.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.301
It contains me.

01:43.396 --> 01:47.981
Or a mental clone of my,
um... personality.

01:48.067 --> 01:51.230
And now, on Farscape...

01:51.320 --> 01:52.230
Crichton:
Gu...

01:52.321 --> 01:54.482
Aeryn:
Gu-ah-un.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.449
Do the next one.

01:59.537 --> 02:03.029
Su-ah-nuh.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.238
Sun.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.324
59*};5ijfw‘.‘
gay/é;
-.=¢‘ii;;e’:*'~::::~i

02:09.255 --> 02:12.042
You know that everyone thinks
you're crazy as a banta bug.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.248
Yeah, what else is new?

02:13.342 --> 02:15.583
Mmm. You still hearing it?

02:15.678 --> 02:17.839
Hmm... feeling it.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.306
It's like a homing signal.

02:19.390 --> 02:21.597
Or a trap. Scorpius trap?

02:21.684 --> 02:25.142
No, no, no. I know Scorpius.
This is different.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.972
All right, so let's say it is
this alien who takes the
form of your father.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.182
Why would they come looking
for you now?

02:31.277 --> 02:34.144
l have no idea. I thought the
Ancients were done with me.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.899
Mmm.

02:35.990 --> 02:42.156
Why don't you just ignore it?

02:42.246 --> 02:45.158
Why do you want to
look for them?

02:45.249 --> 02:47.285
'Cause I'm not done with them.

02:51.464 --> 02:52.704
Do you think I'm crazy?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.629
Mmm.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.127
I've always thought
you were crazy.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.345
You know that.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.715
Do you know why I'm crazy?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.888
Why are you crazy?

03:04.560 --> 03:05.515
You.

03:05.603 --> 03:06.388
Me?

03:06.479 --> 03:07.309
( laughs )

03:07.396 --> 03:09.478
You.
-Mmm.

03:13.903 --> 03:14.562
Aeryn.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.814
What?
-Up here.

03:16.906 --> 03:18.362
What?
-Look.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.361
Rygel:
Oh, no! Not again!

03:24.455 --> 03:25.661
Have you seen this before?

03:25.748 --> 03:28.706
Unfortunately, yes, and
so has Crichton.

03:28.793 --> 03:29.873
Yes, Talyn?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.211
Appearances to the contrary,

03:31.295 --> 03:33.707
this planet seems to have no
mass. It must be an illusion.

03:33.798 --> 03:37.416
It's a billboard. It means
we've found what we're
looking for.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.509
Hello, anybody out there?

03:40.596 --> 03:43.679
Ancients? Jack, whatever you
wanna call yourself.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.757
This is John Crichton.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.388
Hello.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.266
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

03:59.615 --> 04:00.604
I'm here.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.609
Talyn...

04:01.700 --> 04:03.565
Crais, no! I know this guy.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.322
And I thought I knew you.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.492
I may have been wrong.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.914
If I was...

04:11.001 --> 04:12.537
I may have to kill you.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.953
Let him go, or I will shoot.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.087
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.891
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

04:28.978 --> 04:30.309
I'm trying to stay alive...

04:30.396 --> 04:32.307
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

04:32.398 --> 04:35.310
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.857
If you can hear me...
Beware.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.935
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

04:39.029 --> 04:41.486
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

04:41.574 --> 04:46.284
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.486
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

04:48.581 --> 04:51.288
Not show them...
You exist...

04:51.375 --> 04:55.084
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.782
What the heck is this?

05:30.873 --> 05:34.411
Our last encounter left a
residual link between our minds.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.833
| summoned you with it.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.956
Right, got it. Make your point.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.584
My race was looking for
a world to inhabit.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.292
Yeah, I know, but Earth didn't
work for you, so I can't
help you there.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.378
We found a world,
perfectly suited to us,

05:47.473 --> 05:49.634
and the Ancients are there now.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.681
Well, congratulations.

05:51.769 --> 05:54.431
What can I do for you then?

05:54.522 --> 05:59.437
On our travel to the new world,
we saw this.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.529
Your module,

06:02.613 --> 06:05.855
being flown through an
unstable wormhole,

06:05.950 --> 06:08.236
piloted by this creature.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.659
What? Who the hell is that?

06:10.746 --> 06:12.156
You tell me.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.910
No idea. Never seen one before.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.831
When was this?

06:16.919 --> 06:18.455
A third of a cycle ago.

06:18.546 --> 06:24.041
Well, my module was safe aboard
Moya a third of a cycle ago.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.386
Are you saying this is
a duplication?

06:26.470 --> 06:29.428
I'm saying I don't know
anything at all about it.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.931
What's that device?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.269
Phase Stabilizer.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.516
Allows travel through
any wormhole.

06:37.606 --> 06:41.440
Technology only a few
could duplicate.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.690
Did you teach this creature
to build it?

06:44.780 --> 06:47.487
How would I do that when I
don't know how to build it?

06:47.575 --> 06:49.156
Are you speaking the truth?

06:49.243 --> 06:52.986
Jack, you're a mind
reading alien.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.744
Like my dad, don't you know
when I'm speaking the truth?

06:57.835 --> 07:00.497
I can only penetrate your
mind this deep.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.294
Bummer.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.622
We gave you a gift.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.166
You misused it.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.589
What gift?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.763
If you didn't build that
stabilizer, who did?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.974
I don't know.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.267
What the hell?!

07:17.354 --> 07:21.597
Sorry, but I need your attention
and we only have a few moments.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.025
This is a fascinating place in
your memory, and hard to find.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.103
What do you want?
-Discretion.

07:27.197 --> 07:31.440
That false father image will
terminate us both if he
learns of my existence.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.321
There's no reason he should.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.119
Scorpius didn't copy
your module.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.413
How do you know?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.876
Tell me this, John.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.337
Could you rebuild a module
from memory, huh?

07:42.421 --> 07:43.536
Probably not.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.542
Neither could Scorpius.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.592
All he knows is what my
neurochip absorbed from you.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.713
So, who did it?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.669
Who else knows of your
wormhole search?

07:52.765 --> 07:58.476
Who has both access to your
module and the expertise to
replicate it, hmm?

07:58.562 --> 07:59.392
Furlow.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.095
Elementary.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.226
Either that or you're
covering your ass.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.353
Why give Jack irrelevant
information

08:05.444 --> 08:07.856
which may only provoke him
into killing us all?

08:07.946 --> 08:09.277
Aeryn included.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.026
Why would he kill Aeryn?

08:11.116 --> 08:13.323
Gamble with her life
if you want.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.823
Tell him everything, but don't
say you weren't warned.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.869
Maybe...

08:20.959 --> 08:22.085
Furlow.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.079
The mechanic?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.000
Yeah.

08:24.088 --> 08:25.077
From Dam-Ba-Da?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.628
That's the one.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.424
So, why don't you go bug her?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.503
And can we please get
out of my head?

08:39.561 --> 08:41.597
He's unhurt, Aeryn Sun.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.805
We may have misjudged you.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.979
I hope we did.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.307
Who are you?

08:47.403 --> 08:49.485
My given name is...

08:49.571 --> 08:54.156
(speaking unintelligible
alien name )

08:54.243 --> 08:55.528
You can call me Jack.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.325
How did you get on board?
-Save it, Crais.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.119
We've got bigger fish to fry.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.197
Jack, show 'em the postcard.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.327
Maybe they can identify
the pilot.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.794
You guys know what that
critter is?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.917
Aeryn:
I don't recognize the
species. Crais?

09:10.008 --> 09:11.839
I'll just check Talyn's
data banks.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.168
Oh!

09:14.263 --> 09:16.345
Rygel:
It was a Charrid, Stark.

09:16.432 --> 09:18.047
A frelling Charrid!

09:18.142 --> 09:19.552
You're familiar with
that species?

09:19.643 --> 09:23.977
Oh, a thousand cycles ago, the
Charrids invaded Hynerian space.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.898
They killed a billion of my
people, ate a million
of our young.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.771
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

09:29.862 --> 09:34.982
We finally repelled them with
suicide attacks, wave after
wave after wave.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.909
More death than even you could
fathom, until we drove them off.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.952
But if they had wormholes,
they could come back...

09:41.039 --> 09:44.873
And attack us without warning
and disappear before we
could retaliate.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.292
We have no defense against that.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.755
Oh...

09:48.839 --> 09:52.252
I know a Delvian chant that is
very calming in times of stress.

09:52.342 --> 09:55.675
Vas pyloba mishkith,
lano trelba.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.294
Say it with me.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.096
Vas pyloba mishkith,
lano trelba.

10:00.184 --> 10:01.173
Vas pyloba mishkith...

10:01.268 --> 10:03.099
Stop it, you lunatic!

10:03.187 --> 10:07.180
Get it through what's left of
that head of yours that
this is serious!

10:07.274 --> 10:10.061
Crais:
More serious than
you can imagine.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.196
Unconfirmed intelligence
reports

10:13.280 --> 10:18.240
suggest an alliance between the
Charrids and the Scarrans.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.988
Crichton:
Lay it on me, Jack.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.320
Why are you so afraid of a
Halloween mask in a tiny module?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.326
Because they were on a
course similar to ours

10:25.417 --> 10:28.079
which may have led them right to
the new home of the Ancients.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.159
All right, I understand.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.835
You're concerned about
your privacy.

10:30.923 --> 10:34.006
But you guys are god-like aliens
with the power of wormholes.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.344
We're a dying race, John.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.759
The voyage made us weaker.

10:37.846 --> 10:41.009
We may not be able to defend
against a hostile species.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.933
That's why I stayed behind,
to make sure no one
could find them.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.135
You missed the boat?

10:46.230 --> 10:47.185
I volunteered.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.103
But you can catch up?

10:49.191 --> 10:50.271
Unlikely.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.270
Well Jack, this may all
be for nothing.

10:52.361 --> 10:57.651
Funnyface could be Furlow's
test pilot, but Furlow's not
a hostile species.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.072
She's an entrepreneur.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.320
We can buy her out and
everybody's gonna be happy.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.493
Then we should contact this
Furlow and investigate.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.036
Yeah, you're probably right.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.250
lf Furlow's on to something,
I wanna know about it.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.257
Stark:
That's Dam-Ba-Da?
I thought it was populated.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.548
It appears to be sterilized.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.421
The spaceport's been leveled.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.718
By what?

11:19.805 --> 11:22.342
Unknown. Talyn detects
no weapon installations.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.558
Any life signs?

11:23.642 --> 11:25.598
Talyn can't detect anything
at this distance.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.426
Could be camouflaged
or underground.

11:27.521 --> 11:31.264
Talyn, flare activity from this
star could damage your systems.

11:31.358 --> 11:36.978
When we're gone, get into the
planet's shadow and shut down
all exterior systems you can.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.687
So, you think we really
need all this stuff?

11:38.782 --> 11:41.273
I hope not, but we don't know
what we're going to find.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.654
Yeah. Sorry to screw up
your life again.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.157
Yeah, as long as you know
it's all your fault.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.533
Me and my damn wormholes.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.330
Not all wormholes are bad.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.455
No, but uh, ifl hadn't been
hunting wormholes,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.332
we never would have run into
Furlow or the Ancients.

11:54.423 --> 11:58.086
If you hadn't fallen into
a wormhole you never
would have met...

11:58.176 --> 11:59.586
Rygel.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.964
Furlow, I would think is a
better match for you.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.510
Furlow? Yeah, she's sexy.

12:06.602 --> 12:10.390
She's a good one to take home
and meet the folks.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.894
What? You didn't think I planned
on going home alone, did ya?

12:14.985 --> 12:17.067
I haven't been thinking
about it.

12:18.113 --> 12:19.899
lwouldn't...

12:21.283 --> 12:23.239
want to do that.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.405
To go back alone.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.621
lwouldn't want you to.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.411
We should talk about this.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.750
Some other time?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.544
Yeah.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.217
We could do lunch.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.228
Stark:
Still can't detect any activity
on the planet's surface.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.321
Here, Stark.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.614
Thank you.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.612
Th... thank you, thank you.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.532
Jack:
Put 'em on. Flare is coming.

13:09.623 --> 13:10.408
How do you know?

13:10.499 --> 13:12.160
I can sense them.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.535
lt'll occur in ten microts.

13:13.627 --> 13:17.245
Be a good time to land.
lt'll cover our approach.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.545
Where's your goggles?

13:18.632 --> 13:20.168
Crichton:
He doesn't need 'em, Fluffy.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.543
Those aren't his real eyes.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.420
Hmm?

13:22.511 --> 13:24.251
Everybody hang on.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.337
(accelerating hiss)

13:32.980 --> 13:34.015
(gasps )

13:44.783 --> 13:46.739
Crichton:
All right, seat belt
sign is off.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.658
Aeryn, Crais, we're up.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.082
Crais:
The entrance is open!

14:01.258 --> 14:02.293
Crais:
Get down!

14:02.384 --> 14:03.499
Crichton:
Take cover!

14:22.237 --> 14:24.353
Where the hell's that
crossfire coming from?

14:24.448 --> 14:25.608
Aeryn, can you see anything?

14:25.699 --> 14:27.030
No, it's the flares.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.108
Maybe it's just a
couple of guys.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.197
(growling)

14:33.582 --> 14:35.322
Okay, maybe not.

14:45.844 --> 14:46.549
Here they come.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.716
(all yelling)

15:01.735 --> 15:03.271
Crais:
Talyn, stay in shadow.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.489
Don't expose your senses to the
intensity of the solar flare.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.319
He knows we're in trouble and
he's coming back to help us.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.650
Well, tell him to stop!

15:11.745 --> 15:13.406
He refuses!

15:17.375 --> 15:18.455
What are you doing?

15:18.543 --> 15:20.499
They're cut off.
There's nothing we can do here.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.248
You try to leave,
and you'll be cut off.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.125
Another flare's coming.
20 microts.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.456
Crais:
Talyn a flare is imminent!

15:25.550 --> 15:26.460
Shut down your senses!

15:26.551 --> 15:28.052
Break off!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.512
Crais:
No Talyn, go back!

15:32.599 --> 15:34.260
Do it, Talyn!

15:38.814 --> 15:40.805
(hissing)

15:43.318 --> 15:45.183
( screaming )

15:48.990 --> 15:50.651
Talyn, reverse direction!

15:50.742 --> 15:52.152
Head for the dark side
of the planet!

15:52.244 --> 15:53.484
Take it out!

15:55.163 --> 15:56.243
(Crais continues screaming )

16:01.128 --> 16:02.664
Pull back!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.165
(yells, pants)

16:09.261 --> 16:11.968
We got to get to that bunker.
How's Crais?

16:12.055 --> 16:13.591
I can't see!

16:13.682 --> 16:15.422
Talyn is blinded, and so am I!

16:15.517 --> 16:17.758
Stark, come down here now and
take Crais back to the Pod.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.266
Crichton and I will have to go
in alone. You stay here.
You stay undercover.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.391
Cover me.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.120
( high-pitched whine)

16:36.204 --> 16:38.115
Fire in the hole!

17:01.897 --> 17:04.309
Stark ( chanting ):
Si Fiesh Ra vaheerma
eket siek...

17:04.399 --> 17:06.185
Si Fiesh Ra vaheerma
eket siek...

17:06.276 --> 17:07.391
Si Fiesh Ra vaheerma
eket siek...

17:07.485 --> 17:09.191
Crais:
He said help me, you idiot.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.395
Not chant me over to
the other side!

17:12.490 --> 17:13.525
( groans )

17:13.617 --> 17:14.606
Oh!

17:38.683 --> 17:40.799
Well, well, well.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.636
If it isn't my favorite flyboy.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.439
Just couldn't stay away
from me, huh?

17:47.525 --> 17:49.390
What the hell happened to you?

17:49.486 --> 17:52.193
You know, I'd be happy to
tell you all about it,

17:52.280 --> 17:55.317
if you'd just cut me
the frell down!

18:10.715 --> 18:11.579
Furlow!

18:11.675 --> 18:12.664
What?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.000
Save someone to question.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.380
Aeryn:
How many troops are
on the planet?

18:16.471 --> 18:18.211
Bring any sisters?

18:18.306 --> 18:22.595
You won't be enough to
pleasure all of us.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.433
How many?!

18:24.521 --> 18:27.354
My, Grandma.
What big teeth you have.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.056
We'll feast on you tonight.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.312
And tomorrow all your families.

18:32.404 --> 18:35.271
Yeah. And you can have our
pets for breakfast.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.231
( reverberating whine )
Communicator?

18:38.326 --> 18:39.827
Think so. Might be able
to listen in.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.243
Aeryn:
How many ways into
this place, Furlow?

18:42.330 --> 18:43.365
Except for the front door?

18:43.456 --> 18:46.038
None. All the approaches
are booby-trapped

18:46.126 --> 18:48.492
and some of the automatic guns
are still working.

18:48.586 --> 18:50.167
Some?

18:50.255 --> 18:51.165
Probably.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.746
I'll check the perimeter.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.797
Crichton:
That's a good idea.
Do me a favor?

18:54.884 --> 18:57.500
Take Smiley here and stash him
somewhere on your way out.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.301
You fear me.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.004
No, you just smell.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.464
( snarls )

19:03.768 --> 19:05.099
Furlow:
Toodle-oo.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.222
Move.
( Furlow growls playfully)

19:09.733 --> 19:11.314
What the hell is this?

19:11.401 --> 19:12.436
What do you think?

19:12.527 --> 19:15.064
A truly fine copy
of your module.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.567
Got a nice detailed scan
last time you were here.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.945
Yeah, when you ripped off
all my data.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.278
You know, you're going to have
to let that go, Johnny.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.578
Point is...

19:25.665 --> 19:28.907
I flew through a wormhole,
four times.

19:29.002 --> 19:32.586
And not just a wormhole,
a proto-wormhole.

19:32.672 --> 19:37.257
Unstable as all flitz,
didn't even muss my hair.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.380
How long have the Charrids
been here?

19:39.471 --> 19:42.133
I hired 'em, for security.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.929
They even did the first
test flights.

19:44.017 --> 19:48.226
Then, a couple of solar days
ago, the blotchers
double-crossed me.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.474
Killed all my techs.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.227
Tried to torture the
secret out of me.

19:53.318 --> 19:58.108
Get the passwords to my
computers but uh...
l'm tougher than they thought.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.313
Right.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.193
Oh, one more thing.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.820
What?

20:05.830 --> 20:07.821
Thanks for the rescue.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.209
(girlish giggles)

20:11.044 --> 20:12.124
Ah...

20:12.212 --> 20:14.203
Aeryn:
Transport Pod, all
clear outside.

20:14.297 --> 20:17.414
Crais:
Aeryn, my link with Talyn is
gone. He's blinded and panicked.

20:17.509 --> 20:19.090
I must find him and
board him quickly.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.168
All right. Stark, send in
Rygel and Jack.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.923
You try and take Crais
back to Talyn.

20:23.014 --> 20:26.051
Uh, w-wait a microt.
l'll fly Crais back.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.303
We get Talyn working, we can
kill more Charrids, quicker.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.134
No, no, no, no!

20:29.229 --> 20:31.140
Stark knows Talyn.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.142
He can help calm him down.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.973
Let me be your eye.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.023
Perfect!

20:36.111 --> 20:38.318
The half-blind leading
the blind.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.612
No, he's right Rygel.
Get in here.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.859
She likes me more than
she likes you.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.282
(growling)

20:44.369 --> 20:47.236
(whooshing )

20:50.708 --> 20:53.120
What happened to this planet?
It looks like it's been
carpet-bombed.

20:53.211 --> 20:57.295
Solar flares got bigger than
ever. Most everybody
cleared out.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.543
Solar flares?

20:59.634 --> 21:04.003
The last time l was here, you
said there weren't going to
be any solar flares for 4.8 cycles.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.633
I lied.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.923
You lied?

21:08.017 --> 21:11.145
Yeah, I figured it'd keep you
away for a while so I could...

21:11.229 --> 21:12.469
work in peace.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.311
Charrids are keeping their
distance but it won't
last forever.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.608
They are regrouping.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.482
I'm telling ya, they're
not gonna get in.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.655
Who's he?
-We call him Jack.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.277
Jack, Furlow. Furlow, Jack.

21:25.368 --> 21:27.950
Hands off the
merchandise there...

21:28.037 --> 21:29.197
Jack.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.870
Get me the tools so I
can open this up.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.323
Give me one reason why
I oughtta let ya.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.498
Aeryn:
Can I give you two?

21:34.586 --> 21:36.702
We just saved your life,
and this gun.

21:37.547 --> 21:38.707
Fair enough.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.584
Jack:
Another flare. 1O microts.

21:40.675 --> 21:43.166
Pod, another flare, 8 microts.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.922
We're ready.

21:45.013 --> 21:47.595
Well, some more than others.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.764
(hissing)

21:49.851 --> 21:51.341
Crichton, can you hear me?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.097
Of course not, not while
the flare's happening!

21:53.188 --> 21:54.894
Oh, right. I don't like
this planet much.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.142
Neither do I. Just stay on
the vector I gave you.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.894
We're on vector.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.191
Don't worry, we'll find Talyn.

22:00.278 --> 22:03.020
Finding Talyn is just the
beginning of our task.

22:11.289 --> 22:14.156
Furlow:
Talk to me, Johnny.
Who is that thoddo?

22:14.250 --> 22:17.208
He's one of the last remaining
members of an ancient alien race

22:17.295 --> 22:19.001
who knows all about wormholes.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.955
Mm-hmm. So what's he doing here?

22:22.050 --> 22:24.666
Making sure they don't fall
into the wrong hands.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.253
Right. Well, he can have
the technology.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.589
If he can afford it.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.093
I think we should tie
her back up.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.143
Don't tempt me.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.893
No, I said tie her back up.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.148
Charrid:
A Hynerian!

22:44.239 --> 22:46.230
Good timing. I'm hungry.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.485
Pity you're so aged.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.316
You won't be so tasty.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.742
(soft growling )

22:51.829 --> 22:54.206
Don't glare at me!
I'm not impressed.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.578
You think a Hynerian could
ever frighten me?

22:57.669 --> 23:00.376
Oh, I'm not here to
frighten you.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.328
No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Then what?

23:02.423 --> 23:03.879
To question me?

23:03.967 --> 23:08.552
Plainly you are unaware of our
superior resistance to pain.

23:08.638 --> 23:13.223
Actually, I do know something
about Charrid physiology,

23:13.309 --> 23:17.348
just as I know something
about your weaponry.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.770
(sinister chuckling)

23:19.857 --> 23:22.269
This Ractor, for instance.

23:22.360 --> 23:27.650
contains neural circuits
that inflict ten times
the normal pain.

23:27.740 --> 23:32.109
Designed to be effective even
against your own kind.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.534
( inhales deeply)

23:33.621 --> 23:35.862
A very unpleasant death.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.073
You don't dare kill me.

23:38.167 --> 23:38.917
Don't I?

23:39.002 --> 23:40.742
The others want me alive.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.202
Yes.

23:42.297 --> 23:46.006
Well, plainly you're unaware
of one more fact:

23:46.092 --> 23:50.210
I don't give a garanta's brax
what the others want.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.385
(frightened snarl )

23:53.766 --> 23:57.008
Jack:
Primitive. Underpowered.

23:57.103 --> 24:00.721
It's only a prototype
you welnitz.

24:00.815 --> 24:03.352
But the underlying
technology is sound.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.560
You bet your frangle it is.

24:06.654 --> 24:09.396
What have you done?
Who else has this knowledge?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.105
Furlow:
Nobody got it from me.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.363
And they won't, unless of
course they can meet my price.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.739
You'd sell this to anyone?

24:15.830 --> 24:18.116
Excuse me, is that any
of your business?

24:18.207 --> 24:20.368
Yes! You have no idea
what this can do!

24:20.460 --> 24:21.620
Sure I do.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.793
That's how I know it'll
make me rich.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.620
( explosion )

24:25.715 --> 24:27.876
Mortar fire.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.344
Well, the Charrids are
getting bold again.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.419
Can this structure withstand
a mortar attack?

24:32.513 --> 24:33.923
Probably.

24:34.015 --> 24:35.630
Frell.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.966
Ah, let 'em come if they dare.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.597
That's my motto.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.103
( scream )

24:43.191 --> 24:44.397
Rygel?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.193
What have you done?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.317
lnterrogating.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.485
I thought he'd last much
longer than that.

24:56.579 --> 25:03.041
He did tell me that there's a
Scarran Dreadnaught heading
for this planet.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.290
lt'll arrive within six arns.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.099
( explosion )

25:21.187 --> 25:23.098
Aeryn:
I'm hearing more and more
calls on their comm net.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.180
They're gettin' ready to
storm the castle.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.356
Crais, can you hear me? Stark?

25:27.443 --> 25:30.901
Furlow:
Keep trying. Those flares play
hezmana with comm signals.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.525
Can this ship of yours stand up
to a Scarran Dreadnought?

25:33.616 --> 25:35.072
Not a chance, even if
he could see,

25:35.159 --> 25:38.196
it's about twice the size
of a Command Carrier.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.283
We have to do something!

25:41.374 --> 25:43.114
We will. Come on.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.824
W-w-where are we going?

25:44.919 --> 25:47.001
You like killing Charrids,
now's your chance.

25:47.088 --> 25:48.498
But I, uh...

25:50.133 --> 25:51.293
This doesn't worry you?

25:51.384 --> 25:54.296
Nah... even if they do get in a
lucky hit and breach a wall,

25:54.387 --> 25:56.673
the booby traps'll get them
before they get in.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.262
If the Charrids hadn'tjumped
me in orbit, they'd have
never gotten in.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.844
If they breach the defenses,
we're going to have to act fast.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.305
"Act fast"?
You have some kind of plan?

26:07.400 --> 26:10.892
We don't let the bad guys
get the technology.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.273
Furlow:
Tarbek grenades.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.275
Surely you're not suggesting...

26:15.366 --> 26:17.106
We destroy it.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.157
(loud rumbling)

26:20.246 --> 26:21.827
Crais:
What can you see?

26:21.914 --> 26:23.654
Stark:
Damage! Damage! Damage!

26:23.750 --> 26:25.832
Whatever would I do without
your verbal gifts?
-Oh, you want more words?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.534
Well, the conduits are damaged,
bulkheads damaged, external
sensors damaged.

26:28.629 --> 26:30.369
There is nothing that
is not damaged.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.797
Least of all you.
-I can see.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.124
If only you could think.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.470
Talyn, I know you're scared,
but you must be able to hear me.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.510
Turn to your treblin side
and accelerate!

26:38.598 --> 26:40.589
Get deeper into the
planet's shadow.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.264
Better. Better.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.263
I can find my way
on my own ship!

26:47.982 --> 26:49.438
Are you ready now?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.320
( Rygel grunting )

26:57.408 --> 26:58.909
Rygel:
What's this?

26:58.993 --> 27:00.324
It's an automated gun turret.

27:00.411 --> 27:02.322
Well, it doesn't look
like it's working.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.405
Well the targeting system's
gone, but everything else
is still intact.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.206
You can operate it manually.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.203
lcan?

27:08.294 --> 27:12.333
Yeah. That's where you
reload, this is aim...

27:12.423 --> 27:14.254
and this is fire.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.375
Now, if you can't actually
hit anything,

27:17.470 --> 27:20.007
just make sure you force the
Charrids to keep well
away from us.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.177
Ah, where will you be?

27:21.265 --> 27:22.471
I'll be somewhere else.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.264
Oh, we work better as a team.

27:24.352 --> 27:27.389
Well, you didn't need any help
when you were knifing
the Charrid.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.890
This is different.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.266
I'm unprotected here.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.519
What happens if they fire in
a mortar shell?

27:32.610 --> 27:34.521
Well, that's simple. You'll die.
So keep them back.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.102
You keep them back.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.609
You're the artillery expert.
-Tell me something, Rygel.

27:38.699 --> 27:43.068
How many Hynerians perished in
the suicide attacks when they
repelled the Charrids?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.948
Millions upon millions.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.951
Any of them volunteer or
were they all forced?
-Why?

27:48.042 --> 27:52.251
I'm just curious to know
whether sacrifice and bravery
are Hynerian concepts.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.249
(sighs)

27:54.340 --> 27:56.877
Show me how this works again.

27:56.968 --> 28:00.256
That's your reload, that's your
aim, and this is your fire.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.840
Goodbye.

28:05.017 --> 28:09.807
You still don't understand how
dangerous this technology
can be?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.388
A wormhole isn't just a
shortcut through space.

28:12.483 --> 28:15.270
It can be turned into a weapon
of incredible destruction.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.148
We can't let the Scarrans
have that kind of power.

28:18.239 --> 28:21.982
Okay, so we turn around and
sell it to the Peacekeepers.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.361
Maybe the Nebari, too.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.285
Balance of power and
we clean up.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.237
Jack:
Potential for disaster
is too great.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.368
The danger is clear.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.870
It isn't clear to me.

28:37.008 --> 28:41.377
You know, I think all this high
minded talk is a pile of dren.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.428
And you're just trying to
take out a competitor.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.221
I speak the truth.

28:46.309 --> 28:49.221
Oh, yeah? And why should
I believe you?

28:49.312 --> 28:52.725
Where do you get all this
cosmic knowledge?

28:52.815 --> 28:55.352
Who are you to tell me
what I should do?

28:59.363 --> 29:01.354
What the frell?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.273
Who are you?

29:03.367 --> 29:05.904
Jack:
Someone who understands
the risks of power.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.862
Do you, Furlow?

29:08.956 --> 29:12.244
Do you understand the future
you're about to create?

29:12.335 --> 29:17.329
Are you willing to see entire
planets, entire civilizations,
wiped out?

29:26.182 --> 29:28.173
Put your weapon down.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.600
Put it down, now.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.238
Aeryn, you have explosives
in your pack?

29:48.329 --> 29:49.193
Yes.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.573
Set them.

29:54.835 --> 29:59.078
He, uh... that alien...
why didn't you tell me?

29:59.924 --> 30:01.289
I think I did.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.171
Fair enough.

30:25.116 --> 30:27.732
You know, this really
isn't necessary.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.445
We could, uh, just beat it
before the Dreadnought
gets here.

30:31.539 --> 30:34.451
You, me, in the module,
down the wormhole.

30:34.542 --> 30:38.410
Sell the technology, only to
peaceful races, of course.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.005
And what about the others?

30:40.089 --> 30:42.421
Well, same thing happens
whether we're here or not.

30:42.508 --> 30:47.593
Listen, the Scarrans aren't
gonna leave anybody
breathing.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.012
No reason for all of us to die.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.055
Crichton:
What's with your computer?

30:52.143 --> 30:54.350
Somebody's tapped in.

30:57.982 --> 30:59.597
They're stealing all my data.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.182
Shut it down!

31:01.277 --> 31:03.359
I can't. They've got
full control.

31:03.446 --> 31:05.562
Aeryn:
Stand clear. Now!

31:13.748 --> 31:15.079
Who tapped in?

31:15.166 --> 31:17.498
A remote download.
Overrode all my passcodes.

31:17.585 --> 31:21.077
Charrids are too stupid for
that. Had to be Scarrans.

31:21.172 --> 31:22.708
How much data did they get?

31:22.798 --> 31:25.460
Oh, enough to make their
own Phase Stabilizer.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.338
But I guarantee the Dreadnought
will still get here.

31:28.429 --> 31:32.672
They'll wanna make sure that
nobody else gets the prototype.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.133
And what's in here.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.263
And, uh...

31:37.354 --> 31:39.686
you know that thing we were
talking about earlier?

31:39.774 --> 31:42.231
It's looking even better now.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.058
Jack:
We need to destroy that data.

31:44.153 --> 31:47.065
Furlow:
Are you paying attention?
'Cause it's too late.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.192
The data is on the
Dreadnought now.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.695
Jack:
Exactly. Therefore we need to
destroy the Dreadnought.

31:51.786 --> 31:55.449
There isn't anything on this
planet that would even
get its attention.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.620
What thing you were talking
about earlier?

32:01.337 --> 32:02.793
Oh, nothing.

32:04.298 --> 32:05.834
Crichton:
You got a plan?

32:05.925 --> 32:08.132
Jack:
Yes, something the Ancients
wouldn't permit.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.881
Their sanctuary is
under threat.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.259
I believe we can convert
this Phase Stabilizer to
another function.

32:14.350 --> 32:15.931
We?

32:16.018 --> 32:19.602
Yes. Your knowledge of this
level of technology is
greater than mine.

32:19.688 --> 32:23.772
Alone, I'd never be able to
complete the modifications
in time.

32:23.859 --> 32:27.351
Except I don't know how this
thing works, much less
how to modify it.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.232
lwon't be much help.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.116
Yes, you will.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.781
During our last encounter,

32:32.868 --> 32:36.076
the Ancients imbedded something
else deep within your memory.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.246
The equations to create
wormholes.

32:39.333 --> 32:43.702
It wasn't meant to be accessed
consciously, but merely
to guide you.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.549
Guide me?

32:50.636 --> 32:52.797
Why notjust give it to me?

32:52.888 --> 32:55.880
Because it was important that
you develop it on your own.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.135
Or else not at all.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.262
Is that some sort of rule?

32:59.353 --> 33:01.639
Only hints, otherwise
it's cheating?

33:01.730 --> 33:04.346
There were Ancients who didn't
want to give you anything.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.602
This knowledge is
very dangerous.

33:06.694 --> 33:10.482
Yeah, I know. So give me the
useless consolation prize.

33:10.573 --> 33:12.188
No, not useless.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.365
It was meant to keep you
on the right path.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.534
Possibly subtracting years
from your research.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.703
"Possibly."

33:19.790 --> 33:21.530
Well, thanks for the help.

33:21.625 --> 33:26.790
John, this knowledge may
save all of our lives here.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.297
I can unlock it.

33:30.384 --> 33:33.251
And what will your friends
think about that?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.301
They'd stop me if they could.

33:35.389 --> 33:39.098
If they knew what you and l
were creating here they'd
kill us both.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.348
That's terrific.

33:43.439 --> 33:45.179
Jack, I already got half
the universe after me.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.357
I really want the Ancients
on my ass as well.

33:49.737 --> 33:52.149
We don't have a choice.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.197
That Dreadnought is less than
five hours from here.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.491
I need your expert help. If
you're unwilling to give it...

33:57.578 --> 34:01.491
ldidn't say I wouldn't help.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.824
Good.

34:15.262 --> 34:19.175
Furlow, get me all the tools
and components that you have.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.099
I need wave guides,
circuitry, anything.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.142
It would help if! knew
what you were making.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.346
I also need some nuclear fuel.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.523
A tenth of a mallot of
partanium isotope would do it.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.350
Comin' right up.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.732
Jack.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.783
l have a confession to make.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.452
I knew about the stuff you
guys put in my head.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.162
How?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.787
Guy named Scorpius, he
discovered the info was there

34:46.877 --> 34:51.041
and he put a neurochip in my
head to extract the information.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.462
And he succeeded?

34:52.549 --> 34:55.382
Well, the chip's gone, so I'd
say, yes, more or less.

34:56.345 --> 34:58.006
Why didn't you tell me?

35:05.396 --> 35:08.638
All right, there's more.

35:08.732 --> 35:14.568
When the chip was pulled, a
chunk of Scorpius's personality
was left behind.

35:15.698 --> 35:18.155
A neural clone?

35:18.242 --> 35:20.904
You could call it that.
I call it, uh...

35:21.203 --> 35:22.739
Harvey.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.824
Then we can't unlock the
information in front
of this clone.

35:28.544 --> 35:30.284
So what do you wanna do?

35:31.714 --> 35:34.421
My mental energy is limited.

35:34.508 --> 35:40.754
But I believe between the two
of us, we can drive this
clone from your mind.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.057
Could you say that with a
little more confidence?

35:48.355 --> 35:50.516
I don't know how strong
this clone is going to...

36:00.284 --> 36:04.744
Scorpius Clone:
Before you rejoin them, John...
rejoin them, John, we must speak.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.697
You cannot be seriously
considering my removal.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.167
Yes, I can.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.412
I've had time to acclimate
myself to your brain,

36:11.503 --> 36:13.243
to permeate every facet
of your mind.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.671
I will not go easily.

36:15.758 --> 36:18.465
Are you... threatening me?

36:18.552 --> 36:20.167
I warn you, John.

36:20.262 --> 36:24.722
If you attempt this, I will
fight you and I will win.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.220
If your brain really isn't big
enough for the both of us,

36:27.311 --> 36:31.850
either I'll survive,
or neither of us will.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.851
Harvey...

36:33.942 --> 36:37.526
kiss my medulla oblongata.

36:37.613 --> 36:39.353
You think I'm bluffing?

36:39.448 --> 36:42.235
( snarling ):
Do you want to die?

36:42.326 --> 36:43.406
(growling)

36:46.747 --> 36:48.453
What the frell is...

36:55.089 --> 36:57.296
We're closed, you thoddoes!

37:00.386 --> 37:01.751
John?

37:03.806 --> 37:06.718
You all right? John?

37:06.809 --> 37:09.801
Yeah. Um, fine.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.190
I don't see a lot of choice.
Harvey's gotta go.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.233
And you can do this, Jack?

37:19.321 --> 37:22.188
I can infuse him with all the
mental capacity that I possess.

37:22.282 --> 37:23.863
Which you admit is limited.

37:23.951 --> 37:25.157
We take what we can get.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.280
Is there some way to
transfer energy?

37:27.371 --> 37:30.158
Can you link his mind with mine?

37:30.249 --> 37:33.207
No. Aeryn Sun, John already
has your strength.

37:33.293 --> 37:37.127
And someone's got to stay
outside in case everything
goes pear-shaped.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.670
I know what to do.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.791
Hey! Anybody there?

37:42.886 --> 37:44.717
I've scored nine direct hits.

37:46.098 --> 37:49.261
But the Charrids aren't
getting the message!

37:49.351 --> 37:52.514
They're getting closer,
and I'm running out of ammo!

37:52.604 --> 37:55.311
All right. I'll get you some.

37:55.399 --> 37:57.310
Frelling Charrids.

38:00.404 --> 38:03.441
Just don't start anything
until I get back.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.701
(grunting)

38:07.828 --> 38:09.443
Here's your partanium.

38:09.538 --> 38:12.621
Trouble is, I don't know if
I can scrape up a
protection suit.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.868
I don't need one.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.369
No kiddin'.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.201
Imagine if he was on our side.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.252
He is on our side.
-Uh-huh.

38:19.339 --> 38:24.925
What I will need is a focused
trans-emitter coil so I can
maximize the power output.

38:25.012 --> 38:28.220
Boy, you don't want much,
do ya?

38:28.307 --> 38:29.513
Hope you're not in a hurry.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.840
We're in a hurry.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.265
I'll do my best.

38:34.396 --> 38:35.476
Stark:
You're sure you don't want help.

38:35.564 --> 38:37.225
Crais:
I don't need your help!

38:37.316 --> 38:38.897
Talyn, can you hear me?

38:38.984 --> 38:41.646
Nothing's happening. Well, apart
from the tossing and turning.

38:41.737 --> 38:45.229
He's overcompensating for his
maneuvers because he can't
tell what's going on.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.860
I'll have to take over.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.157
What are you looking for?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.905
Manual override.

38:50.996 --> 38:51.985
Here.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.786
Talyn, I'm taking control.

38:53.874 --> 38:58.459
I will get you stable so you
can calm down and heal
your senses.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.331
It's working, I think.
It's working, working.

39:00.422 --> 39:02.253
Is the navigation console
responding?

39:02.341 --> 39:04.332
No, but I'm feeling better.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.465
Something doesn't feel right.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.717
Must be the... must be
the docking control.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.594
It looks all right.

39:13.685 --> 39:14.800
Try the comms again.

39:14.895 --> 39:18.228
Boost Talyn's signal
to maximum.

39:18.315 --> 39:19.521
Aeryn? Crichton?
Can you hear me?

39:19.608 --> 39:21.018
Stark? Is that you?

39:21.109 --> 39:23.316
Stark:
We're trying to take
control of Talyn.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.019
He's still blind but
at least he's calmer.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.445
Can he fight? Stark?

39:27.533 --> 39:30.070
(communications static)
Can... you... hear me?

39:30.160 --> 39:30.990
Oh...

39:31.078 --> 39:32.284
Frell!

39:44.007 --> 39:45.213
Rygel:
About time!

39:45.300 --> 39:46.836
You let two through.

39:46.927 --> 39:50.260
Two? But I turned at least
12 of them into sand stains.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.679
Aha! Here comes number 13.

39:52.766 --> 39:55.132
(Rygel yelling)

39:55.227 --> 39:57.263
Oh, miscalculated the windage.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.218
Next time I'll get him.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.565
I ever tell you about
Rygel the Ninth?

40:00.649 --> 40:02.355
No.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.479
Single-handedly led the
climactic charge at the
Battle of Katreen.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.653
He was a hero?
-He was a moron.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.323
Dominars are far too valuable
for combat, much less
front lines.

40:11.410 --> 40:15.244
But you know, strangely enough,
I think I understand
why he did it.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.823
Ah, ha, ha! Second try!

40:18.917 --> 40:20.703
(demented laughter)

40:20.794 --> 40:22.125
Taste this, bloodsucker!

40:22.212 --> 40:24.419
We'll make a soldier out
of you yet, Rygel.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.997
Well, don't think I'm going
to make a habit of it.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.832
Hmm... Now...

40:37.436 --> 40:38.892
It's time.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.559
Buckle up, Scorp.
We're going for a little ride.

41:21.647 --> 41:25.060
We don't have to do this, John.
I... I pose you no threat.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.890
Right.

41:26.985 --> 41:30.352
I happen to know that the
wormhole knowledge is still
inside your brain.

41:30.447 --> 41:31.812
But I don't want it!

41:31.907 --> 41:33.067
Your better half does.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.398
Well, he has a copy.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.109
But whether he knows how to make
use of it is not my concern.

41:37.204 --> 41:40.617
Therefore, there's no reason
to get rid of me.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.618
Yeah, there is.
-No, it's the truth, John.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.700
I don't want to overtake you.

41:44.795 --> 41:47.286
I'm happy to coexist.

41:47.381 --> 41:48.291
I'm not.

41:49.424 --> 41:50.709
Oh, stop this, John.

41:50.801 --> 41:54.168
I've helped you countless times.
I've even saved your life.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.844
To save yourself. You don't get
brownie points for that, Scorp.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.298
Oh, but I can help you now.

41:59.393 --> 42:02.681
That alien, he's using you.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.353
And after you've done his
dirty work for him,

42:05.440 --> 42:09.854
he will terminate you, Furlow,
Rygel, Stark, Aeryn...

42:09.945 --> 42:12.903
Do not play the Aeryn card,
Scorp. You killed her.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.149
Aeryn is alive.

42:14.241 --> 42:16.903
Now Zhaan's gone.
Who do I thank for that?

42:16.993 --> 42:20.577
(fearfully ):
Stop this, John!
Or we'll both die!

42:20.664 --> 42:23.155
How can you die, Scorp,
when you're not even real?

42:23.250 --> 42:25.536
Oh, I can feel it! I can feel
that we're both going to die!

42:25.627 --> 42:28.915
Can you feel it?
Why should I care?

42:29.005 --> 42:31.212
Because I am part of you, John.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.041
Yeah, I know, and
I'm sick of it.

42:34.136 --> 42:35.751
( screaming )

42:37.806 --> 42:39.171
John, what's happening?

42:40.851 --> 42:42.057
John?

42:43.019 --> 42:44.930
( panicked gasping )

42:50.235 --> 42:51.315
Help me, John!

42:51.403 --> 42:52.438
Go to hell, Scorpy.

42:52.529 --> 42:54.269
"For everything there
is a season.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.902
A time to keep, and a
time to cast away."

43:06.293 --> 43:08.284
I warned you!

43:13.091 --> 43:15.332
(both yelling)

43:25.604 --> 43:27.060
Jack?

43:29.191 --> 43:30.397
John?

43:37.574 --> 43:38.734
Ha, ha, ha!

43:38.825 --> 43:41.157
That's it! Keep running!

43:41.244 --> 43:44.953
Oh, I'll give you indigestion!

43:45.040 --> 43:48.157
Charrid cowards couldn't hit a
pregnant Iobboth at that dist...

43:49.711 --> 43:51.326
(gasping)

44:03.266 --> 44:06.599
(groaning in pain)

44:06.686 --> 44:08.392
(gasping and coughing)

44:15.320 --> 44:17.356
Crichton-Scorpius:
Officer Sun.

44:18.198 --> 44:20.314
What luscious lips,

44:20.408 --> 44:23.616
amongst other things.

44:24.621 --> 44:27.533
Crichton was a very lucky man.

44:27.624 --> 44:28.204
( choking )

44:28.291 --> 44:29.872
Where is he?

44:29.960 --> 44:31.700
Gone.

44:31.795 --> 44:34.081
Gambled and lost.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.834
How unfortunate you
must lose as well.

44:42.264 --> 44:43.629
Oh...
