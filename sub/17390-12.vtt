WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:05.537
Hey.
Hey.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.106
Look who's back from
the flooring expo.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.407
How many free burritos

00:08.409 --> 00:10.509
did you sneak out with
this time?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.577
Six.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.779
I'm so happy I'll be sealed

00:13.781 --> 00:16.382
inside this tin can
with you all day.

00:16.384 --> 00:20.185
I think I might have
just changed our lives.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.720
Turns out the only person
who likes free burritos

00:21.722 --> 00:24.590
more than me
is Lisa McCaffrey.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.658
The property developer?

00:26.660 --> 00:28.527
I've been trying to get
a meeting with her for years.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.429
Well, I chatted her up
at the salsa bar,

00:30.431 --> 00:33.799
and then I held her plate
while she guac'ed her taco.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.135
Is that your way of telling me

00:36.137 --> 00:38.137
I'm gonna get a call
from her lawyer?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.705
No, I broke the ice.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.041
And I got us a chance to bid
on their new development.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.409
Five houses.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.077
Are you serious?

00:45.079 --> 00:47.046
Don, we've never done
a job that big before.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.181
That could mean a lot
of money coming in.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.316
We could buy more equipment,
hire more crew.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.185
I think we've got
a real shot at this.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.686
I gave her the full Don Burns.

00:54.688 --> 00:57.689
Her hair was blowing back
like a girl in a music video.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.692
ADAM:
<i> Okay, so</i>

01:00.694 --> 01:02.261
when we sit down with Lisa,

01:02.263 --> 01:03.662
I'll hit her with our
glowing references,

01:03.664 --> 01:05.064
run her through the numbers.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.331
Then I turn on the charm,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.200
and, boom,
close with a joke.
Okay.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.735
You gonna do the one about
the one-legged ballerina

01:09.737 --> 01:11.703
names Eileen?

01:11.705 --> 01:14.506
No. McCaffrey's Irish.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.642
I'm gonna go with the Pope
stuck in the phone booth.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.743
Ah.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.179
She'll enjoy
the social commentary.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.281
Okay, then you hand out
our floating key chains,

01:22.283 --> 01:23.582
and try not to
give 'em the one

01:23.584 --> 01:25.451
with your car keys
attached this time.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.787
And then, boom, we-we're done.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.356
Hey, how's the pitch coming?

01:31.358 --> 01:32.691
Looking good, yeah.
We're all done.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.793
We're gonna watch the game.
Oh, hey, um,

01:34.795 --> 01:36.562
how would you feel
about inviting Lowell

01:36.564 --> 01:38.097
to come watch
with you tonight?

01:38.099 --> 01:39.698
Lowell?
Mm-hmm.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.101
Here?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.537
On purpose?

01:46.407 --> 01:48.340
I see enough of him
at school.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.275
And he was in rare form
yesterday

01:50.277 --> 01:52.177
at "Bring Your Dad
to School" day.

01:52.179 --> 01:54.613
So, as a contractor,
I get to use

01:54.615 --> 01:57.483
a lot of really cool tools,

01:57.485 --> 01:59.852
like, uh, this thermal laser,

01:59.854 --> 02:03.222
which can tell me
the temperature of anything.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.124
Mrs. Rodriguez is...

02:05.860 --> 02:08.494
...ice-cold, as usual.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.330
Okay, now Emme is
gonna hand out free

02:11.332 --> 02:13.765
floating key chains
to all of you.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.734
(children cheering)

02:15.736 --> 02:17.603
Thank you, Mr. Burns,
for giving the kids things

02:17.605 --> 02:19.271
they will throw
at me later.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.641
Lowell, you're up.
Thanks, Mrs. Rodriguez.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.343
My name is Lowell,

02:24.345 --> 02:25.911
and I am a
stay-at-home dad,

02:25.913 --> 02:27.379
which means
40 hours a week,

02:27.381 --> 02:29.648
I am entirely alone.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.618
And that's how
I discovered my talent

02:32.620 --> 02:37.222
for eating toast
into the shapes of states.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.625
Well, that's why I think
you should invite him.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.627
I saw him at the
grocery store today,

02:41.629 --> 02:43.529
and he was obviously lonely.

02:43.531 --> 02:47.299
He's not the kind of guy
that Don and I hang out with.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.767
Well, I mean, is that
such a bad thing?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.636
I mean, Don, you know,
I love you,

02:50.638 --> 02:53.172
but when you two are together,
half your sentences end with,

02:53.174 --> 02:54.706
"That's what she said."

02:56.544 --> 02:59.711
Even when there's no way
that's what she could have said.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.848
Honey, could you just try
to keep your fingers out of it.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.884
That's what she said.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.619
(both chuckling)

03:10.891 --> 03:12.858
Yeah, well, I already told
Lowell he could come over.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.193
He'll be here in ten minutes.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.195
What?
So basically you just

03:16.197 --> 03:17.829
set me up on a playdate?

03:18.799 --> 03:21.266
That is not how men
make friends.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.302
I am expanding your horizons.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.703
I do it for myself, too,

03:24.705 --> 03:26.972
which is why tomorrow
I am going for drinks

03:26.974 --> 03:28.840
with Alicia Rodriguez.

03:28.842 --> 03:32.844
Wow, I can't believe you're
doing that to yourself.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.347
That's what she said.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.987
I am a woman.
I know what she said.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.924
¶ ¶

03:54.835 --> 03:57.269
Hey, guys. Thanks so much
for having me.
Hey.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.437
When Andi said you wanted me
to come watch the game,

03:58.439 --> 04:01.607
I was super jazzed.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.876
Well, the jazz is mutual.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.346
But here's the thing,
Lowell.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.915
Once the Penguins game starts,
we don't talk much.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.017
Oh, I never talk during
Pens games-- bad luck.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.585
Gotta unpack these snacks

04:13.587 --> 04:15.520
before the puck drops.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.789
First up,
seven-layer dip.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.659
Spoiler alert,
the bottom layer is Doritos.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.796
What did you just say?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.898
He said Dorito dip.
That's dip with Doritos

04:26.900 --> 04:30.535
in it that you can
dip into with more Doritos?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.671
You invented this?

04:32.673 --> 04:35.941
I've been waiting for you
my whole life.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.510
How's it going, fellas?

04:38.512 --> 04:40.012
No talking.
The game's starting.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.747
Sorry.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.485
I've been waiting
for you<i> my</i> whole life.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.822
Here's an
intermission treat.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.357
Fresh popcorn
with Junior Mints

04:52.359 --> 04:53.792
already mixed in.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.727
Shut<i> up!</i>

04:57.698 --> 04:59.364
Hey, Don,
I just got an e-mail

04:59.366 --> 05:00.966
from Lisa McCaffrey's people.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.769
They want to know our tech needs
for the presentation.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.405
A bucket of water
for the key chain would help.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.309
They could see it float.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.010
Okay, that's an idea.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.312
But I don't think
that's what they meant

05:13.314 --> 05:14.613
by "tech" needs.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.315
They just want to know
if your PowerPoint

05:16.317 --> 05:17.749
is on your laptop,
or if you're gonna integrate

05:17.751 --> 05:18.850
with their monitors.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.452
Do you need HDMI, VGA,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.387
or are you going
straight composite?

05:27.461 --> 05:31.330
H-G-D... what?

05:31.332 --> 05:33.332
It's pretty technical.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.067
I only know about it because
I used to work in marketing

05:35.069 --> 05:36.635
before we had kids,
and I lost

05:36.637 --> 05:39.805
a very high-stakes arm wrestle
to my wife.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.075
Y-you were in marketing?
Mm-hmm.

05:43.077 --> 05:46.378
Oh, hey, would you mind if
we ran our presentation by you?

05:46.380 --> 05:47.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.348
What?
I'm our marketing guy.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.550
Let Little Debbie here
take care of the snacks.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.787
Yeah, but Little Debbie sounds
like he knows what he's doing.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.522
Okay, I like that
we have nicknames,

05:57.524 --> 06:00.559
but maybe we could try something
like "Champ" or "Scout."

06:00.561 --> 06:03.595
I don't want to go in there
and look like amateurs.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.797
Well, I'm just saying, I don't
think we need all that stuff.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.799
Well, I'm just saying this is
a whole new ball game.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.802
Lowell, back me up with
some of your nerd words there.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.972
Come on, Scout, speak up.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.808
Well, I loved that.
Thank you.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.379
Um, generally, when these
big companies hear pitches,

06:20.381 --> 06:22.514
they're expecting
a multimedia presentation.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.149
Animation, 3D models.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.851
And I'd be happy
to help if you want.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.553
That sounds great.
No, thanks.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.722
Why are you getting
your back up?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.924
Because I got the meeting,
and I'll close the deal.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.693
It's what I've done
since we started.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.628
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:36.630 --> 06:38.096
this dip has
upset my stomach,

06:38.098 --> 06:40.432
and I would like
to be at home.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.703
Well, if it made you sick,
why are you taking it with you?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.405
So later,
when I feel better,

06:46.407 --> 06:48.173
I can eat it again and
make sure that's what it was.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.944
ADAM:
<i> Hey.</i>

06:52.946 --> 06:54.713
How'd it go tonight
with Lowell?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.616
Uh, he was fine.
Don was the problem.

06:57.618 --> 06:58.784
Did he eat too many snacks

06:58.786 --> 07:00.185
and have to take
his pants off again?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.921
No, no, no, no.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.424
Lowell offered to help us
make a more high-tech pitch,

07:05.426 --> 07:07.426
and Don got all
bent out of shape.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.711
His fly was down,

07:08.712 --> 07:09.995
but I think it was
just a coincidence.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.697
Well, it's not a surprise.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.866
I mean, Don is not
a huge fan of knowledge.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.536
Remember how mad he got
when we gave him

07:17.538 --> 07:20.071
that word-of-the-day
calendar?
Yeah.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.540
Yeah, he's got this theory

07:21.542 --> 07:23.008
that his brain is
like his stomach.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.109
Every new thing he takes in

07:24.111 --> 07:26.711
pushes an old thing out.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.079
I've got to make room
in Don's brain

07:28.081 --> 07:29.848
for Lowell's ideas.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.083
Well...

07:32.085 --> 07:34.453
I'm just excited that
you got along with Lowell.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.621
Did you tell him how much fun
you had hanging out with him?

07:38.992 --> 07:40.759
Men don't do stuff like that.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.927
(cell phone chimes)

07:44.898 --> 07:46.465
It's from Lowell.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.233
"I had so much fun
hanging out with you."

07:49.903 --> 07:53.238
Smiley face, shooting star,
hockey puck.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.241
You have to e-mail him back.
Something thoughtful.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.242
Will you stop trying
to make me do

07:57.244 --> 07:59.177
weird things with other men?

08:00.481 --> 08:02.247
That's what she said.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.953
Come on, that was solid.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.022
But I should
write Lowell back.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.090
He is offering to help me.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.092
Uh, well, you do it.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.560
I'm bad at these.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.663
Just say something
breezy, yet manly.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.232
(chuckles):
Oh, fun.

08:20.234 --> 08:24.135
Okay, "Great hanging out
with you, too.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.539
"Your pants were super cute...

08:28.976 --> 08:31.576
<i> ...bro."</i>

08:31.578 --> 08:34.145
Very funny.
(chuckles)

08:36.283 --> 08:37.916
Did you actually send that?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.651
Get it back.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.553
It's too late.

08:41.555 --> 08:44.155
(singsongy):
You have a new boyfriend.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.593
<i> Okay, Butterbean,</i>

08:48.595 --> 08:50.595
Have a great day, huh?
Mwah.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.197
Oh, listen, for your snack,

08:52.199 --> 08:55.534
I gave you popcorn
with Junior Mints.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.969
Shut... up.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.972
I know,
you're gonna love it.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.240
Adam! Adam!

09:02.242 --> 09:05.010
Hey, Lowell.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.812
Good morning, "bro."

09:07.814 --> 09:09.814
Ah, so you got my e-mail.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.083
I was so pumped,
I made an animated graphic

09:12.085 --> 09:14.085
of the Burns Brothers logo
to show you what I was

09:14.087 --> 09:16.221
talking about last night--
take a look.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.156
(heroic music plays)

09:18.158 --> 09:20.091
(explosion)

09:20.093 --> 09:23.695
Wow, our names exploded
right out of that house.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.297
Hey, can you send that to me
so I can show it to Don?

09:25.299 --> 09:26.565
I think he'll
really love it.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.666
Already did.
Already sent it.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.234
Oh.
(chuckles)

09:29.236 --> 09:30.835
This is only the beginning.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.572
I can make a presentation
that you'll like even more

09:33.574 --> 09:35.340
than my super cute pants.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.577
You know, your tone is
very different in e-mails.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.980
Yeah, people say I sound
just like my wife.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.582
It was Andi,
wasn't it?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.584
Well, to be honest...
Don't answer.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.752
I just want to ride
this rainbow.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.789
(heroic music playing)

09:50.791 --> 09:52.724
(explosion)

09:52.726 --> 09:55.727
Wow! Our names just exploded
out of that house!

09:55.729 --> 09:57.596
Nice job. I love it.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.097
I didn't make it,
Lowell did.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.333
I hate it.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.102
What is your problem?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.704
Our business
is just you and me.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.872
I'm the sales guy,
and you do whatever you do.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.140
The work?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.276
I'm just saying
three's a bad number.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.344
Somebody's gonna get
pushed out,

10:12.346 --> 10:14.145
and I don't like it.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.881
You're always worried about
something getting pushed out.

10:16.883 --> 10:20.151
Not everything is
like your stomach, Don.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.754
I really think we should
let Lowell help us.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.955
Well, I forbid it.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.024
You can't forbid it,
we're partners.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.626
Fine, let's take a vote.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.628
We've tried this before.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.997
There's only two of us.
It never works.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.365
Well, let's just see
what happens.

10:33.367 --> 10:34.699
All in favor?

10:34.701 --> 10:36.234
(sighs heavily)

10:36.236 --> 10:37.235
All opposed?

10:38.705 --> 10:40.105
I don't know why I even do it.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.909
So, um, how's it going
at school with Adam?

10:44.911 --> 10:48.046
I, uh, it's f-fine. Fine.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.982
Aw, did you guys
have another fight?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.418
(laughing):
On the contrary.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.287
Um, uh, y-you know what,
never mind. It's...

10:56.289 --> 10:58.990
Ah, come on. Spill it.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.159
I'm not gonna drop it
until you tell me.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.661
You won't judge?

11:02.663 --> 11:04.929
You won't know if I do,
how about that?

11:04.931 --> 11:06.197
(both laugh)

11:07.668 --> 11:08.933
Last night,

11:08.935 --> 11:10.935
I had a dream
about your husband.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.270
It was...

11:12.272 --> 11:15.173
Cinemax-y.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.710
(laughs)

11:18.712 --> 11:20.345
(nervously chuckles)

11:20.347 --> 11:22.280
And Adam and I were,

11:22.282 --> 11:24.683
you know, boom-chucka-chucka.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.984
Oh.
(chuckles)

11:25.986 --> 11:27.352
And sound effects.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.989
(upbeat music plays)

11:30.991 --> 11:35.226
Wow. I can't believe you got
the whole presentation done.

11:35.228 --> 11:38.897
And how did you get a bald eagle
to land on my shoulder?

11:38.899 --> 11:42.701
The first thing I did
was believe it was possible.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.002
(chuckles)

11:44.004 --> 11:46.137
Hey, are you sure Don's
gonna be okay with this?

11:46.139 --> 11:49.374
Oh, when he sees this, he is
gonna be more than okay with it.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.109
You know what, let me worry
about Don, okay?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.110
Let's watch it again.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.845
(chuckles)

11:55.982 --> 11:57.382
What is Lowell doing here?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.752
Don, I thought you had
a banjo lesson tonight.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.354
My teacher got a gig
on a riverboat.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.757
Well, hey, I'm
glad you're here.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.092
Check out Lowell's
presentation.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.960
That's what you're doing?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.895
I can't believe you would go
behind my back.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.431
Well, I'm doing it for us.
I'm trying to get us this job.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.999
But I forbade it.

12:15.001 --> 12:17.102
Well, I think you were wrong.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.170
Should we vote on it?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.172
How're are you gonna vote on it,
there's only the...

12:21.174 --> 12:23.475
Don't-Don't-Don't even.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.944
Look, you're being pigheaded.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.145
Just take a look at it.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.013
No. I've seen all I need to see.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.915
Here's what's gonna happen:

12:30.917 --> 12:33.485
I'm gonna do the presentation
to Lisa McCaffrey on my own,

12:33.487 --> 12:36.054
without you
or your new best friend.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.856
Oh, really?

12:37.858 --> 12:40.191
So, you're gonna be so stubborn
that you ruin it for both of us?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.360
Yes. And if you want
a meeting with her,

12:42.362 --> 12:45.163
you can go guac her taco
on your own time.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.134
(door closes)

12:49.136 --> 12:52.871
Okay, the headline is
I'm your new best friend.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.247
Wow, that sounds like a real
overreaction, even for Don.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.816
He is stubborn
like a mule.

13:04.818 --> 13:09.320
Also like a mule, you can't walk
up behind him or he'll kick you.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.157
Uh-huh, so there are
two mules in this fight.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.859
Wait, why am I a mule?

13:14.861 --> 13:18.363
Oh, please, I have had many
a fight with you, my friend.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.165
What, you're telling me

13:20.167 --> 13:22.000
that you change your mind
when you hear a good argument

13:22.002 --> 13:23.168
for the other point of view?

13:23.170 --> 13:26.504
Well, I'll let you know
when I hear one.

13:26.506 --> 13:30.241
Look, obviously for Don, this is
about more than getting a job.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.510
I mean, sometimes things seem
like they're about one thing,

13:32.512 --> 13:33.878
but they're really
about something else.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.047
You think?
Yeah.

13:36.049 --> 13:40.084
Like... Mrs. Rodriguez
had a sex dream about you.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.153
That's got to be

13:42.155 --> 13:43.521
about something else.
(laughs)

13:43.523 --> 13:45.190
What?!

13:45.192 --> 13:47.292
Did you just make that
example up or is that real?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.993
Let's just say I made it up...

13:48.995 --> 13:50.328
Ugh.
...but it's real.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.330
(laughs)

13:52.332 --> 13:54.265
I have to see her at school.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.568
Why would you tell me that?

13:56.570 --> 13:58.570
Well, because
I wanted to see

13:58.572 --> 14:00.471
what my face looked like
when she told me.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.906
So, you know...
(clucks tongue)

14:01.908 --> 14:03.074
...got it.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.442
Come on, I already got

14:04.444 --> 14:06.311
my hands full with Don.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.979
(sighs)
Okay. I mean...

14:07.981 --> 14:09.414
All right, well,
did you even try to find out

14:09.416 --> 14:11.115
what's really bothering Don?

14:11.117 --> 14:15.854
Once again, you have no concept
of how men do things.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.990
Okay? We don't ask
about feelings.

14:18.992 --> 14:22.193
Feelings were invented
a long time ago,

14:22.195 --> 14:25.029
so that women would have
something to talk about

14:25.031 --> 14:26.097
back at the cave...

14:27.467 --> 14:30.869
...while men were out hunting.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.637
Okay.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.606
So, what's your plan?

14:34.608 --> 14:36.207
I'm gonna handle things with Don

14:36.209 --> 14:38.443
the way I always handle things
with Don.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.111
By torturing
and harassing each other

14:40.113 --> 14:41.446
and never accomplishing
anything.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.616
Also known as the
Tom-and-Jerry method.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.618
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.521
Say what you will, those two
guys took Hollywood by storm.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.899
Where's my chair?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.369
You might want to look
in the Porta Potti.

15:04.371 --> 15:07.372
Well, I can't because
I had the Porta Potti

15:07.374 --> 15:09.340
towed to your front porch.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.175
Enjoy the smell.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.511
That is so juvenile.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.580
Yeah, well...

15:16.516 --> 15:19.984
My drawer is full of pudding.

15:19.986 --> 15:23.922
I'm not gonna ruin the surprise,
but I made a lot of pudding...

15:24.925 --> 15:27.458
...and it's in a lot of places.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.094
You really think you can do this
presentation without my help?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.663
Why not?
You think you can

15:31.665 --> 15:33.264
do the presentation
without my help.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.332
That's not what I said.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.600
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.602
My ears are facing
the other direction.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.470
Okay, you know what?

15:39.472 --> 15:42.006
I'll be outside working.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.008
Call me when you're ready
to apologize, huh?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.180
I found the rest of the pudding.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.582
Oh, you think so?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.554
Okay, come on, Emme.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.423
Hurry up before
Mrs. Rodriguez gets back.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.159
(chuckles)

16:02.295 --> 16:04.495
What are you looking at?

16:04.497 --> 16:07.031
What are<i> you </i>
looking at?

16:07.033 --> 16:09.200
Andi talk to you?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.436
Unfortunately, yes.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.104
I'm not ice-cold now, am I?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.578
We have got to get you
in a carpool.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.315
What are you doing here?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.117
I got an e-mail from you

16:26.119 --> 16:28.019
saying you wanted to apologize.

16:28.722 --> 16:31.055
Let's hear it so I can say no.

16:31.057 --> 16:34.192
I didn't e-mail you,
you big baboon.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.064
Or did I?

16:40.066 --> 16:41.666
You leave your phone out,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.668
beautiful things happen.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.070
Well, I'm not
gonna stay here

16:46.072 --> 16:47.205
if he's not gonna apologize.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.273
Well, I'm not apologizing.

16:49.275 --> 16:50.775
Okay, all right, Tom
and Jerry, that's it.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.144
I am in charge now.
Sit down. Sit down.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.549
Okay, now, obviously something
deeper is going on here,

16:58.551 --> 17:00.284
and we need to get
to the bottom of it.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.087
Now, Don, why are
you so mad at Adam?

17:03.089 --> 17:07.625
Because he's a bossy boss
and he's always a bossy boss.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.195
Okay. Okay.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.031
Um, and what I'm hearing
is that, uh, Don feels like

17:13.033 --> 17:14.732
you don't listen to him
and his ideas.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.101
That's a bunch of crap.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.102
Okay.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.270
(clears throat)

17:19.272 --> 17:20.638
I-I-I think what
Adam is saying is

17:20.640 --> 17:23.041
he never knew
you felt that way.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.511
I'm the older brother.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.147
Interesting.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.648
Okay, um,

17:30.650 --> 17:33.117
I-I-I think what Don is
saying is that traditionally,

17:33.119 --> 17:35.153
he would be the leader
in your relationship.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.221
Okay, he may be older,
but he's a big baby.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.489
Okay.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.059
Um, I think what-what
Adam is saying

17:41.061 --> 17:43.561
is that sometimes he feels
like you don't do what's best

17:43.563 --> 17:45.363
for the business,
like an equal partner.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.165
He's never treated me
like an equal partner.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.367
You only asked me to start
the business with you

17:49.369 --> 17:51.135
because you felt
sorry for me.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.603
What?
Okay, okay, w-wait.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.838
I think what Don is saying is...

17:53.840 --> 17:57.308
Oh... oh, I think
he actually said it.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.279
I'm just your big, dumb brother
who couldn't make it on his own.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.713
Are you kidding me?

18:02.715 --> 18:05.583
I asked you to do it
because I needed you,

18:05.585 --> 18:08.686
and you've always acted like
you were doing me a big favor.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.188
I was sublimating.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.322
Whoa.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.259
Yeah, I read that stupid
word-of-the-day calendar.

18:15.261 --> 18:19.330
Thanks to you, I forgot
365 perfectly good words.

18:19.332 --> 18:22.266
Look, without you,
Burns Brothers would be nothing.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.703
I can't talk to people
and close deals like you can.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.206
You're our secret weapon.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.373
You bet your ass I am.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.410
And when you liked
Lowell's thing,

18:32.412 --> 18:33.845
I thought you were trying
to find someone to replace me.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.746
You're my brother.

18:35.748 --> 18:39.283
I couldn't get rid of you
even if I wanted to.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.220
I think what Adam is
saying is he loves you.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.289
What? N-N-No, I'm not. No.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.625
Well, good, 'cause I would've
kicked your ass.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.294
Aw, he loves you, too.

18:50.296 --> 18:53.164
All right, look,

18:53.166 --> 18:54.432
if you want to do
the presentation without Lowell

18:54.434 --> 18:55.466
that's fine with me.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.767
I-I-I'd rather lose the job

18:56.769 --> 18:58.302
than lose my brother.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.438
(sighs)

19:00.440 --> 19:03.508
Well, I'm fine using Lowell,
as long as we do it together.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.243
Good.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.348
Okay, so, let's go get that
Porta Potti off your porch.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.550
That's gonna be a filthy job.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.652
That's what she said.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.388
(both laughing)

19:23.429 --> 19:25.363
(laughing)
Hey, honey.
ANDI: Hey.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.231
How was the presentation?

19:27.233 --> 19:29.367
Oh, we blew everyone
out of the water.

19:29.369 --> 19:32.937
So, imagine our surprise when
she gave the job to her nephew

19:32.939 --> 19:34.805
who just got fired
from Best Buy.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.376
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.378
Yeah, but the mini-mall
she's building

19:40.380 --> 19:42.747
is going to Burns Brothers
Construction.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.882
Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.784
Yeah, that nephew's gonna have
a hard time building houses

19:46.786 --> 19:49.487
when he keeps finding
pudding in his gloves.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.755
(laughs)

19:50.757 --> 19:51.923
And guess who's
gonna build

19:51.925 --> 19:53.457
a Web site for
these guys? Me.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.293
You don't have to guess,
I just wanted to say it.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.594
Yeah, and none of it
would've happened

19:56.596 --> 19:58.729
if you hadn't put us
together with Lowell,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.565
and put me and Don
back together.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.467
So... thanks for not
staying out of stuff.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.503
Aw.
(kisses)

20:05.505 --> 20:06.704
Pleasure doing
business with you.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.772
That's what she said.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.840
Oh.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.643
Andi out.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.947
Now that one
was solid. Huh?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.754
There's my girl.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.325
(cries out)

20:27.327 --> 20:29.393
(cries out)

20:31.497 --> 20:34.599
Ugh.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.834
Ugh, Andi. Andi.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.003
I just had the weirdest dream.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.973
(shouts)

20:41.975 --> 20:44.542
Boom-chucka-chucka, Mr. Burns.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.712
(cries out)

20:51.751 --> 20:54.619
(sighs, chuckles)

20:55.755 --> 20:59.390
Oh, forget it. My heart
can't take another one.
