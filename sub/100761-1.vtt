WEBVTT

00:24.816 --> 00:28.904
We were the oldest people in that bar
by, like, ten years.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.907
No. I saw the manager come down
and do a till reading.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.367
He was at least 28.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.623
I'm so tired.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.796
It's 10:35 and I'm tired.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.552
Why does it say Thursday?

00:52.511 --> 00:54.346
Jason, why does my phone
say it's Thursday?

00:54.930 --> 00:57.766
-I mean, it's Thursday, so--
-No, I thought it was Wednesday.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.476
-Well, it's not. No.
-Oh, shit.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.644
What? What?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.438
-Well, I ovulated on Wednesday.
-Shit.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.566
That was the window.
Monday to Wednesday was the window.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.359
-The window is shutting, Jason.
-How quickly?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.528
Quickly.
Why didn't you tell me it was Thursday?

01:09.611 --> 01:11.822
It'd be weird if I kept telling you
what day of the week it was.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.366
-I just assume you know days.
-I'm less fertile now.

01:14.449 --> 01:15.742
-I can totally feel it.
-Listen. Look.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.661
A couple of minutes
isn't gonna make a difference, is it?

01:17.744 --> 01:23.667
We are miles away from home, and every
hour the chances go down. Like, a lot.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.839
For everyone's security, please inform
the driver of anything suspicious.

01:31.175 --> 01:33.135
-What? What are you doing?
-We're doing it now.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.053
-We can't.
-No one's watching.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.013
Well--

01:36.096 --> 01:37.931
The one old lady on the bus,
and she's fast asleep.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.224
But we're on a bus.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.517
We're just sneaking one in
under the buzzer.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.103
-Nikki. Nikki, no.
-Well, this is happening.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.147
-So, just get used to it.
-No.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.524
-I can't just do it.
-Just focus. Focus and put a baby in me.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.609
Out of order.

01:49.151 --> 01:50.986
Help me out a bit then. I can't--

01:52.863 --> 01:54.114
-Yeah, there you go. All right.
-Yeah.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.868
Okay. Yeah.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.581
-What's the matter?
-She's putting me off.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.459
-Well, don't look at her. Look at me.
-Okay.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.419
-Look at me.
-Okay.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.008
-What if she wakes up?
-She won't.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.052
-Well, she might.
-Just stop talking then.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.679
-Okay. That's it.
-Oh, just close your eyes.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.097
All right.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.309
No, I can see her even more clearly
in my mind now.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.560
Oh, for God's sake.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.065
-Okay. That's it.
-Okay. Yeah.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.400
-Yeah? Yeah.
-That's it. Yeah, that's it.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.944
Okay. Okay.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.196
Oh, yeah.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.163
Next stop, Eldon Square.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.257
Evening.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.266
-I swear, I think that was it.
-Yeah.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.059
That was the baby.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.203
So what you're saying is, "No baby"?

03:25.998 --> 03:26.999
What, ever?

03:28.208 --> 03:31.753
Well, I'm looking at
an AMH count of under two.

03:31.837 --> 03:36.383
Really? Are you sure? 'Cause it
definitely feels higher than that.

03:37.301 --> 03:43.432
I think conceiving through IVF
using your own eggs is very unlikely.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.476
So, what do we do now?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.228
Well, you could try again.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.731
Though, you have no embryos left.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.234
It would be a case of self-funding.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.238
Are you kidding?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.991
I mean, we could buy a baby for that.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.077
We could literally--
I could go on the Internet, buy a baby.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.830
I have to say that,
with your complications,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.208
the chance of success would be very low.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
So, I can't have a baby?

04:16.173 --> 04:17.757
Let me get you another leaflet.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.096
So, what do we do now?

04:24.598 --> 04:28.810
A small piece of us dies,
and we just carry on with whatever's left.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.605
-All right. As long as we got a plan.
-Well, what else?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.398
-We can keep trying.
-She said it was pointless.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.359
-No, she didn't say that.
-She said it with her eyes, Jason.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.236
Yeah, but how do we even know
she's a good doctor?

04:38.237 --> 04:41.532
She was Asian.
We didn't get the one bad Asian doctor.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.995
How can I miss something I've never had?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.709
Come here.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.767
-He's so lovely.
-Yeah. He's cute.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.102
He really is.

05:12.855 --> 05:13.981
Okay.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.569
That's it. Oh, dear.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.655
You want your mommy, don't you?

05:21.738 --> 05:24.783
I've always had the urge to push in
that soft bit on the top of their head.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.204
No, don't worry. I never would.

05:29.288 --> 05:31.707
Oh, okay. Thanks.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.129
-You don't have kids?
-Oh, no, no, no.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.339
I'm just focusing on my career
at the minute.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.008
Oh, what do you do?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.760
I work for Vista Car Rental.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.971
On the phones.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.807
Great. Well done.

05:48.891 --> 05:49.892
Thank you.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.896
-What is it that you do?
-I'm the fashion editor for Teen Vogue.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.733
Oh, okay. Well, well done too.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.444
She's the only one of my clients
who isn't a complete monster.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.029
I'm only half a monster.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.410
We have actually been trying
for kids for a while now.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.704
It gets much harder
to have a baby in your 30s.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.416
-Oh, does it, Freddy? Not heard that one.
-It's so worth it though.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.169
When you leave that hospital with a child,
everything changes.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.253
Yes, it does.

06:18.337 --> 06:21.298
Yeah. It's like you don't
have to look for the love.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.135
It's just there, you know?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.764
-Beautiful baby.
-Thank you.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.768
I hope he doesn't grow up to be a prick.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.901
You know one of those kids
is called Zephyr?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.529
-"Zephyr"?
-Yeah, Zephyr.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.324
That's not a name.
That's a Dropbox password.

06:48.659 --> 06:52.412
And I'm sorry, but that woman's baby
really wasn't that cute.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.415
-Had a funny-shaped head.
-Yes. Funny-shaped head.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.252
It's like someone made it
in beginner's pottery.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.505
And also, no one mentions the bad stuff.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.675
Not one person today
talked about postnatal depression.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.720
I mean, God forbid that we blow the
whole patriarchal conspiracy wide open.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.180
Do you think you might bum people out

07:10.264 --> 07:12.975
if you start speaking about
postnatal depression at a baby shower?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.811
-Yeah, maybe.
-Maybe.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.524
Thank you for letting me be mean
about our friends.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.359
Oh, my God. You're so welcome.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.163
You want sex?

07:36.623 --> 07:37.666
'Kay.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.294
-What?
-There was a pause.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.045
-There wasn't.
-There was a pause.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.173
-There never used to be a pause.
-There wasn't a--

07:45.090 --> 07:47.176
Fine. There was a bit of a pause,
but I've just had a big dinner.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.511
And it's 1:00 in the morning.
Give me a couple of minutes. I'll get--

07:49.595 --> 07:52.347
-Do you still enjoy having sex with me?
-Absolutely, yes.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.849
As much as you used to?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.894
-Yes.
-Wow. Wow.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.937
-Another pause.
-Look, I've seen the film before.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.231
So, I'm not on the edge of my seat
the way I was the first time.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.776
But it's still, literally,
my favorite film of all time.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.154
I find new things in it
every time I watch it. I--

08:07.863 --> 08:09.656
All right, is it over?
Do you want to break up?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.575
Okay. Yeah, lovely. Let's break up.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.827
And then when people ask you,
"Why did you break up?"

08:13.911 --> 08:16.038
You can say, "Oh, there was a pause."

08:16.121 --> 08:18.123
And then everyone's
gonna think you're nuts.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.876
And they're gonna stay friends with me
instead of you.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.264
-See?
-What?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.683
This is what happens
to people without kids.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.937
Just slowly become bored by each other.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.856
I am not bored of you.

08:42.940 --> 08:45.609
When we first met,
we spent hours on the phone talking.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.611
-We don't do that now.
-We live together now, don't we?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.988
-That would be a bit weird, wouldn't it?
-Jason, you know what I mean.

08:50.072 --> 08:51.615
If we were still on the phones together.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.710
I think I'm ready to talk about adopting.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.295
Yeah?

09:07.840 --> 09:10.008
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah?

09:10.092 --> 09:12.803
Yeah. No. Yeah. I mean. Brilli--
Yes. Let's talk.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.887
Okay.

09:17.099 --> 09:18.684
I know it sounds bad...

09:19.726 --> 09:21.895
but do you think they'd feel
like someone else's child?

09:23.522 --> 09:25.023
I think they probably would,
at first. Yeah.

09:25.107 --> 09:29.236
But I think, you know,
you would wear 'em in like trainers.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.157
You know what the best thing would be?
If we took no funny-shaped heads.

09:34.950 --> 09:35.951
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.203
We could swipe left past
the funny-shaped-headed ones.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.789
-I don't think it works like that.
-It's exactly how it works.

09:40.873 --> 09:44.751
People are gonna come from miles around
to see our perfectly round-headed baby.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.379
-Be a source of extra income for us.
-Would it?

09:47.462 --> 09:48.922
Because people will wanna draw her.

09:49.006 --> 09:53.177
But people won't be able
to draw her head freehand, will they?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.845
Because it's so perfectly round.

09:56.555 --> 09:58.891
-They have to use a compass.
-Use a compass. Yeah.

09:58.974 --> 10:01.977
Or they can draw around a saucer.
There's options.

10:07.566 --> 10:08.692
Yeah, I'd like that.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.407
-Now, please may we have sex now?
-No.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.326
Oh, go on.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.378
It's a good call. Being pregnant sucks.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.173
-Right. When were you pregnant?
-I've been pregnant.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.592
Really? How long for?

10:34.885 --> 10:36.428
Like, four, five months, I suppose.

10:36.512 --> 10:40.933
Oh, my God. Jen! I had no idea.
I'm so sorry.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.893
No, not all in one go.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.978
Just a week here, a week there, you know?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.105
Oh, right.

10:48.607 --> 10:52.569
So, you gonna go foreign?
I would. They're less entitled.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.030
Oh, I don't know.
We're just talking at the minute.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.366
Do you just pick one?
Or is it like an auction?

10:57.908 --> 11:00.160
No, see, you register with an agency.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.413
They make sure you're nice,
then you just meet some kids.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.416
-Why would anyone bother getting pregnant?
-Yeah, I know.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.503
I mean, they won't look like us.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.754
Well, that's good.

11:11.964 --> 11:13.549
Cheers, mate. That's nice.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.384
Hi. Thanks for holding.

11:15.467 --> 11:20.013
Yeah. I just checked with my boss, and I'm
afraid that is the cheapest we can do.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.144
Have you thought about hitchhiking?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.566
Look at that bromelia.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.360
It's given me nothing.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.696
Venezuelan.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.491
That's where
radical social democracy gets you.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.035
I'm not sure the socialists
are in charge of the bromelias, Dad.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.620
You totally sure about this?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.747
Yeah. We think it's the right time. Yeah.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.749
You got to be careful with adoption.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.919
Mel from the club got a rescue dog.
Shat everywhere.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.047
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
with that information.

11:54.131 --> 11:56.049
I've heard they can be trouble,
the adopted ones.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.428
And will they let Nikki adopt,
even though, you know?

11:59.511 --> 12:00.721
What?

12:01.263 --> 12:03.724
-Well, you know what she's like, Jason.
-I do, yeah. She's lovely.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.851
They let anyone adopt nowadays.

12:05.934 --> 12:10.189
Mel knows two fellas got gay married,
and then they gay adopted.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.107
You know you can just say
"married" and "adopted"?

12:12.191 --> 12:13.817
Yeah, well, I don't know all the lingo.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.279
Look, it's gonna be fine, okay?

12:18.155 --> 12:22.159
We're takings things slowly,
and we're not rushing into anything.

12:35.964 --> 12:36.965
Okay.

12:37.049 --> 12:40.260
All right, I know that this looks crazy.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.388
But I think that if I just
acknowledge that, then it's not.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.100
-Crazy people don't know they're crazy.
-And yet here we are.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.477
Look.

12:49.937 --> 12:53.106
These were on offer.
And I just thought, you know, why not?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.234
Do you think you might be
getting ahead of yourself?

12:55.567 --> 12:57.736
-I got us some leaflets.
-Oh, all right, have you?

12:58.362 --> 13:00.155
-Look at page 15.
-Okay.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.241
Do you think she's still available?

13:02.324 --> 13:04.618
You know this isn't a catalog, don't you?

13:06.745 --> 13:09.873
I've signed us up
for an information evening tomorrow night.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.431
-God, I hate Camden sometimes.
-Yeah.

13:26.515 --> 13:30.102
Man bun, vegan,
flip phone, beard oil wankers.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.022
Why don't you get an office job?
Contribute.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.733
-None of your dads are proud of you.
-All right.

13:37.651 --> 13:41.113
-Can we go now? Are we done?
-Are you serious? Have you seen this list?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.615
-Bloody hell.
-Yeah, right.

13:43.699 --> 13:46.535
-How is Erica, anyway? She all right?
-Yeah, she's great. Yeah, yeah.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.620
She's loving
the whole pregnancy experience.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.707
I mean, I'm kidding. It's a shitshow.
Everything's sore.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.002
And last week she cried because
they changed the Newsnight theme tune.

13:55.794 --> 13:59.214
She wants to get the leather saddle
on the rocking horse redone.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.466
-Do you know any good tanners?
-Do you know what?

14:01.550 --> 14:04.094
I think we're between tanners
at the minute, so...

14:04.178 --> 14:08.182
You know, this kid doesn't even exist yet.
I've dropped two grand on it.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.976
Why can't we just have a baby
without all the...

14:12.644 --> 14:14.730
In other countries, they just have babies.

14:14.813 --> 14:19.860
You know, you go there, and there are,
like, babies just on the floor.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.113
They strap them to the front of their
tuk-tuks, and they drive around with them.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.781
They just get on with their lives.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.660
I mean, it's happened seven billion times.
It's not exactly a miracle.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.913
Having one
without starting a blog about it.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.331
That would be a miracle.

14:32.414 --> 14:33.415
All right.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.584
She wants yogurt.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.087
Does she want plain or Greek or what?

14:39.171 --> 14:42.007
It's for my wife's vagina, mate.
I'm not really fussed.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.929
Probably Greek then.

14:55.521 --> 14:59.024
I know it's stupid, but is it possible
that they'll just give us one today?

14:59.107 --> 15:00.692
-At our initial information meeting?
-Yeah.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.946
-Yeah. We are pretty great.
-I know, right?

15:12.329 --> 15:14.581
Why does everyone look so miserable?

15:14.665 --> 15:16.208
Because it's a community center.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.336
Here we go.
Here's another one for the collection.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.339
We could always just move to the country
and raise our leaflets.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.552
He looks scary.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.762
Imagine getting him as your new dad.

15:29.555 --> 15:32.474
This says I need a BMI of under 35.
Have I got that?

15:32.558 --> 15:34.476
-I don't know. Is that good?
-It must be, yeah.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.019
No, probably not.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.145
Hello.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.940
-Would you like one of our packs?
-Yeah.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.401
It explains the process in more detail.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.945
Okay. How long does the whole thing
tend to take generally?

15:45.028 --> 15:47.322
On average, around a year.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.490
-A year?
-Wow.

15:48.574 --> 15:50.742
And then at the end of that,
then we get a baby?

15:51.285 --> 15:53.203
And then we begin the search.

15:53.287 --> 15:57.082
I should say, we don't really have babies.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.253
Will you be getting more in or...

16:01.336 --> 16:03.046
There are so few in the system,

16:03.130 --> 16:05.674
we do encourage you
to consider older children.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.844
-Excuse me.
-All right.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.889
-Hello. Would you like one of our packs?
-Hi.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.186
I suppose I just didn't think
it would be so hard.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.272
Well, they are giving us a human,
aren't they?

16:20.355 --> 16:23.775
But it's a year of being,
like, brutally assessed.

16:24.276 --> 16:26.028
And they talk to everyone in your life.

16:26.111 --> 16:29.865
And then you have to sit in
on this big adoption panel.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.867
"Adoption Horror Stories."

16:31.950 --> 16:33.702
That looks nice and balanced.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.288
Jase, they're gonna come into our lives,
and they're gonna judge us.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.289
Well, so what?

16:37.372 --> 16:39.208
We don't even have lampshades
in all the bedrooms.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.210
You can't get kids
before you get lampshades.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.796
I just don't know
if it's worth going through all this.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.341
Are you saying all this because
they said we might get an older kid?

16:47.424 --> 16:48.425
No.

16:50.594 --> 16:54.973
No. No. I mean, Jase, I'm barely
more than an older kid myself, am I?

16:57.351 --> 16:58.352
All right, well...

16:59.561 --> 17:01.396
If we can't have one of our own...

17:02.606 --> 17:05.858
and we don't want to adopt, then what are
we gonna do with the rest of our lives?

17:05.943 --> 17:06.944
I don't know.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.155
Join a sodding book club.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.377
-Would you like this?
-Yeah.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.461
Yeah.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.592
Thank you.

17:35.097 --> 17:40.978
Past par-ti-ci-ple.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.563
Past participle.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.108
Hello. You are through
to Vista Car Rental. My name is Nikki.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.526
How can I help you today?

17:48.151 --> 17:51.238
For me, it seemed to be
more about character than story.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.661
Yeah, I think...

18:13.302 --> 18:14.428
You all right?

18:24.605 --> 18:26.023
-This is delicious, Nikki.
-Yeah.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.482
-Well, thanks.
-What have you put in it?

18:27.566 --> 18:32.279
I put in it some tomato, garlic,

18:32.362 --> 18:34.740
onion, some chili peppers,

18:34.823 --> 18:39.119
courgette, anchovies, salt, sugar

18:39.203 --> 18:42.289
and just a little bit of emulsifier.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.710
So, what's the news, guys?
How's things with you?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.045
Yeah. Fine.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.507
Lauren's been struggling a little bit
with the pregnancy.

18:51.590 --> 18:55.010
Well, obviously. I mean, for us, it's a
baby. For her, it's the enemy, you know?

18:55.093 --> 18:56.345
Yes. I know that.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.390
-Why are you doing that?
-What?

19:00.474 --> 19:02.601
Kissing on my forehead
like I'm your niece.

19:02.684 --> 19:04.478
All right. I was being tender.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.856
-Jesus.
-You all right? Chill out, Ceausescu.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.399
No. I think my water has just broke.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.028
-Oh, my God.
-Is that a real thing?

19:13.111 --> 19:15.447
-I thought it only happened in films.
-No, that's how you have a baby.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.324
-There you go. Yeah.
-Oh, shit. I haven't got the bag.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.451
-What? Why?
-Because I left it at home.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.370
-I've got plenty of bags, mate.
-All right.

19:21.453 --> 19:23.455
-No, Jason. A hospital bag.
-Should I call an ambulance?

19:23.539 --> 19:26.416
No, no, no. It's quicker to drive.
Oh, shit.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.418
-What?
-I've had three glasses of wine.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.920
How? We've been here for 20 minutes.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.798
I'll drive, and then I will go
pick up some stuff from your house.

19:32.881 --> 19:33.715
-Yes.
-All right?

19:33.799 --> 19:35.342
All right. That's good.
Lauren, darling. Come on.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.426
Right.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.428
All right?

19:39.221 --> 19:41.056
-Let's go have another baby.
-Come on, then.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.104
Hello, mate. I'm just at the house now.

19:48.188 --> 19:51.483
-Right. I'm in. Where do I go?
-In our room.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.403
It's on the chaise longue. That's the sort
of long chair thing by the window.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.321
I know what a chaise longue is.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.619
-Got it.
-Can you get Erica some clean knickers?

20:02.703 --> 20:04.788
That's the chest of drawers on the left,
middle top drawer.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.095
Got her knickers.

20:20.179 --> 20:21.513
And could you bring me a T-shirt?

20:21.597 --> 20:24.057
That's the other chest of drawers
second drawer from the bottom.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.684
Not the bottom.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.104
Did you get that? Not the bottom drawer.

20:30.189 --> 20:31.190
Jason?

20:38.530 --> 20:39.781
Jason.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.493
Hiya!

20:50.542 --> 20:52.544
This is exciting, isn't it?

21:00.802 --> 21:04.723
How are things with you?
Just, like, generally.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.395
You well in yourself?

21:16.652 --> 21:18.320
I'm hungry.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.446
Yeah?

21:21.615 --> 21:22.866
Let's have a see.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.577
Do you like trail mix?

21:26.620 --> 21:28.247
Do you have any chocolate?

21:30.791 --> 21:32.501
Why do you have chocolate in the car?

21:32.584 --> 21:36.797
Because if I keep it in the house,
I eat it.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.716
-You're meant to eat it.
-Yeah, I know. Adults are weird.

21:52.688 --> 21:53.856
Look, I get it.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.192
A baby means change, and change is scary.

21:58.652 --> 22:02.531
You don't know what they're gonna be like,
or if they'll even like you.

22:06.910 --> 22:10.080
But you can't get too attached
to what you think your life's gonna be.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.958
That's where your problems start.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.046
I think a baby will eat my yogurts.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.091
Right. Yeah.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.969
I mean, the yogurt stuff is always hard.

22:33.061 --> 22:36.773
"An aneurysm occurs
when the artery walls weaken.

22:37.399 --> 22:42.070
The pressure of the blood
beats against the weakened walls

22:42.154 --> 22:45.657
and makes them bulge, like a balloon.

22:46.408 --> 22:50.579
An abdominal aortic aneurysm
can be dangerous."

22:51.622 --> 22:53.832
Well, she's half asleep.
She's only hearing tone.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.418
So?

22:57.252 --> 22:58.253
It's a boy.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.382
Yay.

23:06.178 --> 23:08.013
They're so vulnerable.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.057
They sleep so deeply.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.683
Yeah, it's 'cause they trust us.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.435
Idiots.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.327
Do you know what? I do really wanna do it.

24:14.121 --> 24:15.122
Do what?

24:16.832 --> 24:17.916
"It."

24:21.545 --> 24:22.921
Okay.

24:23.005 --> 24:26.967
I just don't know if I have it in me.
They'll see I'm not ready and...

24:27.926 --> 24:31.013
Listen, we've only gotta be better
than the previous parents, right?

24:31.096 --> 24:33.015
So even if we're average...

24:34.183 --> 24:36.435
we'll still look better in comparison,
won't we? Right?

24:36.518 --> 24:38.187
I'm not even average.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.272
-I'm a bloody mess.
-We're all a bloody mess.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.483
That doesn't give you a sick note out of
every bit of responsibility in your life.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.360
All right,
when did you become so fearless?

24:45.444 --> 24:47.571
I don't know.
I think I'm shedding fear with age.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.865
It's like all of the brain cells
that I'm losing

24:49.948 --> 24:51.575
are the ones that were holding me back.

24:53.619 --> 24:55.996
You got it stuck in the weeds!

24:56.079 --> 24:57.831
It's not my fault.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.417
Can I try?

25:01.001 --> 25:03.003
No, it's mine. My toy.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.880
How do you know if you're ready?

25:05.464 --> 25:08.008
We waited until we were ready
once before, didn't we?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.886
And that turned out to be much too late.

25:15.766 --> 25:17.392
Oh, for God's sake.

25:19.478 --> 25:20.687
Where are you going?

25:21.647 --> 25:23.315
What are you doing? Nikki.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.900
-Give that to me.
-What are you doing?

25:24.983 --> 25:26.818
-Do you know how lucky you are?
-Get off!

25:26.902 --> 25:30.322
They are tiny little miracles.
Your 17 Twitter followers can wait.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.698
-Give it back!
-I'm sorry.

25:31.782 --> 25:34.535
I'm doing this for you
and for your children.

25:34.952 --> 25:38.705
-No!
-Talk to your children!

25:39.122 --> 25:40.666
They're not my children!

25:41.917 --> 25:43.043
Mom?

25:46.630 --> 25:47.756
Just don't believe it.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.716
Oh, my God, your phone.
I threw your phone away.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.261
Jason, I threw his phone away.
I am so, so sorry.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.221
Now, look. I'm calling the police.
All right.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.807
Excuse me, excuse me.
Can I borrow your phone, please?

25:56.890 --> 25:58.350
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.

25:58.433 --> 26:01.395
I just saw him and the kids.
I think I'm just emotional because of--

26:02.062 --> 26:05.274
Shit! Jason,
we can't get a criminal record.

26:05.357 --> 26:07.860
They won't give us a kid.
It was in the leaflets.

26:10.654 --> 26:11.989
No, no, it's fine. Just take your time.

26:12.072 --> 26:14.783
Do you really wanna do this?
Do you want to adopt?

26:14.867 --> 26:19.288
Yeah. Yeah, I think I might.
But I can't if I get bloody arrested.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.372
Thank you.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.460
Yes? Yeah. Hello, yes. Police, thanks.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.717
Sorry, mate. We're not bad people.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.011
-It's just a very complicated situation!
-Jason, just run!
