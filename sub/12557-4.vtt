12:46.599 --> 12:50.467
IT'S AN OLD SHOTGUN.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.600
AND I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT HOW SOMEDAY--

12:54.691 --> 12:58.025
SOME MOMENT-- A YANKEE
IS GOING TO COME BY HERE,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.601
AND I'M GOING TO
TAKE OUT THAT GUN,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.770
AND I'M GOING
TO AIM IT AT HIM.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.530
I'M GOING TO
AIM IT AT HIM,

13:03.616 --> 13:05.778
BUT FIRST I'M
GOING TO TELL HIM

13:05.827 --> 13:07.443
THAT HE CAN
CONSIDER THIS

13:07.537 --> 13:09.653
THE LAST SHOT
OF THE CIVIL WAR;

13:09.747 --> 13:14.867
A BULLET IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE ONE MY HUSBAND TOOK.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.170
NO, MA'AM, I DON'T VVANT
TO HEAR NO MORE TALK

13:18.256 --> 13:20.372
ABOUT BUTCHERY
AND BLOODSHED.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.004
THERE'S HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS
OF OUR MEN AND BOYS

13:24.095 --> 13:26.132
THAT WERE
KILLED AND MAIMED.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.389
AND THEN
MR. LINCOLN-MURDERED.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.182

HELLO?

13:42.113 --> 13:43.979

13:44.032 --> 13:46.194
I WONDER IF YOU
COULD TELL ME

13:46.284 --> 13:48.571

WATER AROUND HERE?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.323
THERE'S SOME VVATER OUT
HERE IN THE VVELL.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.238
I'M SURE THE LADY
OF THE HOUSE

13:53.333 --> 13:55.870
WOULDN'T MIND IF YOU
HAD SOME, LIEUTENANT.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.078

TO ME THAT I KNOW YOU.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.439

14:19.525 --> 14:22.563

14:32.497 --> 14:34.613
I GOT IT, I WAS LAYING
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

14:34.707 --> 14:37.699
A SHELL HAD JUST EXPLODED,
TORE OFF HALF MY FOOT.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.709

PATROL OF YANKEES,

14:39.796 --> 14:42.288

ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.589
AND YOU BENT OVER AND
YOU TOOK CARE OF ME.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.211
