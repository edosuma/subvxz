WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:03.106
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:03.244 --> 00:06.420
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:06.558 --> 00:10.976
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.114 --> 00:13.910
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.048 --> 00:16.844
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:16.982 --> 00:20.710
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:22.643 --> 00:25.094
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.232 --> 00:27.924
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.062 --> 00:30.375
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:30.513 --> 00:33.033
Just to get up that hill

00:33.171 --> 00:35.587
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:35.725 --> 00:38.245
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:38.383 --> 00:40.833
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:40.971 --> 00:42.559
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:42.697 --> 00:45.390
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:45.528 --> 00:48.427
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:48.565 --> 00:52.811
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:52.949 --> 00:55.917
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.056 --> 00:58.955
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.093 --> 01:02.476
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:08.482 --> 01:10.932
George, isn't there something
we can do?

01:11.071 --> 01:14.522
Look, just be calm, Weezy.
He'll be gone soon,
and it'll be all over.

01:14.660 --> 01:18.388
Oh, but you read about people
being robbed and killed
all the time.

01:18.526 --> 01:20.563
Don't worry about it, Weezy.
I'm not gonna let you
get killed.

01:22.772 --> 01:24.808
You are scared, too,
aren't you?

01:24.946 --> 01:27.949
Well, I just hope it
ain't true that you turn white
with fear.

01:34.473 --> 01:37.545
You never think that something
like this will happen to you.

01:37.683 --> 01:39.029
Well, anyway, Weezy,
we can't just sit here.

01:39.685 --> 01:41.515
We can't?

01:41.653 --> 01:44.518
Look, just start sliding
your chair around, so we can
get them back-to-back.

01:44.656 --> 01:46.761
Then what?

01:46.899 --> 01:48.729
Then we'll untie the ropes
and make a run for it.

01:49.661 --> 01:52.077
I'm afraid we gotta make
a walk for it.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.735
I'm in no condition to run.

01:56.633 --> 01:57.876
Rest a second.

02:02.087 --> 02:03.330
You know,

02:07.057 --> 02:09.094
this may be a dumb thing
to say,

02:09.232 --> 02:11.614
but it's nice to
hold hands again.

02:13.236 --> 02:14.548
Maybe we should do this
more often.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.898
Oh, George, I love it
when you're like this.

02:21.071 --> 02:24.247
Instead of being grouchy
and unreasonable.

02:24.385 --> 02:26.560
Unreasonable?
When have I been unreasonable?

02:27.630 --> 02:30.080
When? So many times.

02:30.219 --> 02:31.910
I can't even begin
to count how many.

02:32.566 --> 02:33.877
Tell me one. Just one.

02:35.016 --> 02:36.639
How about the time

02:36.777 --> 02:39.676
poor Edith Bunker thought
Archie was gone for good.

02:39.814 --> 02:42.852
You'd just keep making
stupid jokes about him.

02:42.990 --> 02:44.992
I never joke
about Archie Bunker.

02:46.683 --> 02:47.857
Yes, you did.

02:49.514 --> 02:52.965
Dang it, Louise.
Why do you keep sticking up
for that honky?

02:53.103 --> 02:55.209
You hear the way
he's always bad mouthing us.

02:55.347 --> 02:57.556
The only thing worse
than his insults is
his compliments.

02:59.558 --> 03:03.735
"I said, Jefferson man,
you know why you people got
such natural rhythm?

03:03.873 --> 03:05.909
"From being brought up with
all them tom-toms."

03:08.257 --> 03:11.708
Then there's the bull about
just 'cause we black
we can't get enough sex.

03:13.538 --> 03:16.092
We both know that's bull,
don't we, George?

03:21.131 --> 03:22.616
You better lighten up, Louise.

03:22.754 --> 03:25.653
But you do have rhythm.
One out of two ain't bad.

03:31.797 --> 03:35.698
Now, you're going too far.
You hear that, Louise?
Too far!

03:35.836 --> 03:37.631
Don't you slam my table.

03:37.769 --> 03:40.150
What? I'll slam your table!

03:40.289 --> 03:43.050
I'll slam your chair!
I'll slam your wall!

03:43.188 --> 03:44.638
Anything else you want me
to slam?

03:44.776 --> 03:47.434
Yes! The door from
the other side!

03:49.159 --> 03:50.230
You got it!

03:57.961 --> 04:01.793
Okay, so sometimes
I get mad and yell a little.
I don't do it all the time.

04:01.931 --> 04:03.035
That's right.

04:03.173 --> 04:05.417
When you can't think of
anything to yell about,

04:05.555 --> 04:07.316
you run to your favorite
hiding place.

04:10.319 --> 04:12.321
Where are you going?
Someplace where I can think!

04:14.288 --> 04:16.152
George, you're talking like
a damn fool!

04:20.915 --> 04:21.951
JENNY: That's true.

04:22.089 --> 04:23.090
Mama...

04:24.056 --> 04:26.058
Mother knows best, George.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.751
All right, hold, hold, hold,
wait a minute.
Look, what is this?

04:28.889 --> 04:30.339
Now everybody just get
off my back!

04:30.477 --> 04:31.788
Now I am the man
of this house,

04:31.926 --> 04:32.927
and I don't wanna hear
no more of this talk!

04:33.065 --> 04:34.170
Understand?

04:34.308 --> 04:35.689
What are you gonna do
about it?

04:35.827 --> 04:37.691
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

04:37.829 --> 04:40.176
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do!
I'm going to the john!

04:44.214 --> 04:47.459
Oh, Mr. Jefferson.

04:47.597 --> 04:48.874
Oh, oh.

04:49.012 --> 04:50.013
Ooh, I love your legs.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.572
Why don't you sit down
and let's talk this
over rationally?

04:56.710 --> 04:57.883
Good idea.

05:03.164 --> 05:04.165
He went into the john.

05:05.581 --> 05:06.823
Well, you told him to
sit down.

05:08.377 --> 05:09.585
Where do you think
you're going?

05:09.723 --> 05:11.172
Where I don't have to
listen to you.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.967
Oh no, you don't.
You're not running away
from me this time.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.486
Oh, George, open that door!

05:14.624 --> 05:15.591
I don't have to listen
to you.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.008
This is ridiculous.

05:19.146 --> 05:21.631
Can you believe two
grown men acting like that?

05:21.769 --> 05:25.773
What grown men?
They get upset
and they run to the potty.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.261
At least I ain't
as bad as you,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.712
getting mad and yelling,
and making a big fuss
over nothing.

05:34.679 --> 05:37.371
When did I make a big fuss
over nothing?

05:37.509 --> 05:39.787
Valentine's Day when
I didn't bring you nothing.

05:41.444 --> 05:45.241
Then you let them old crazy
Willises use their encounter
techniques on us.

05:47.036 --> 05:48.278
It worked, didn't it?

05:51.074 --> 05:53.870
Okay, now what?
Well, just relax.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.459
Um, why don't you start,
Louise?

05:56.597 --> 05:59.013
Just mention whatever
comes to mind.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.050
What am I supposed to do?

06:01.188 --> 06:04.087
You answer her with
the first thing that comes to
your mind, without thinking.

06:04.225 --> 06:05.813
Just like you always do,
George.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.611
Okay, go!

06:11.578 --> 06:14.132
Okay, uh, hot.
Cold.

06:14.270 --> 06:15.616
Sweet.
Sour.

06:15.754 --> 06:16.824
Good.
Me.

06:23.072 --> 06:25.868
Me? How did you come by me?

06:26.006 --> 06:27.697
'Cause it's good of me
to sit through this junk.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.425
George!
It's all right, Louise.

06:31.563 --> 06:34.014
If that's the first thing that
came to his mind,
that's what he should say.

06:34.152 --> 06:35.222
Now go on.

06:35.774 --> 06:37.845
Uh, high.
Taxes.

06:37.983 --> 06:39.019
Low.
Interest.

06:39.157 --> 06:40.192
Money.
Trucks.

06:40.330 --> 06:42.298
Hold it.

06:42.436 --> 06:46.820
I know I'm not supposed
to interrupt, but what does
a truck have to do with money?

06:46.958 --> 06:49.926
Plenty.
A truck goes by a curb,
splashes mud on suit.

06:50.064 --> 06:51.721
Suit goes to cleaners.
I make money.

06:58.072 --> 06:59.729
Wait a minute, you two.

06:59.867 --> 07:03.423
The whole purpose of
this thing is to dig into
your relationship.

07:03.561 --> 07:06.426
Yes, you must be much
more personal.

07:06.564 --> 07:07.979
Now just forget that
we're here.

07:08.117 --> 07:10.326
I wish I could.

07:10.464 --> 07:13.329
Now listen you...
It was the first thing
that popped into my mind.

07:15.158 --> 07:16.919
Start again. And this time,
make it personal.

07:18.852 --> 07:20.163
Marriage.
Ring.

07:20.301 --> 07:21.510
Sex.
Seven.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.101
I said "sex."

07:27.239 --> 07:28.724
Oh, oh, I thought
you said six.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.663
For a minute there
he had me worried.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.874
The part I liked best
was the potakas.

07:42.289 --> 07:44.740
Like that?
No. Like this.

07:52.782 --> 07:56.268
You're right, Helen.
I feel better already.

07:57.028 --> 07:58.236
Oh, yeah?

08:00.307 --> 08:01.377
Get him, Louise.

08:05.139 --> 08:07.003
Hold him. That's enough.

08:07.141 --> 08:08.729
Now you feel much better,
Louise.

08:08.867 --> 08:11.145
Very good.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.321
Yes. Go on, the point is
trying to get
the juices flowing, that's it.

08:27.161 --> 08:28.715
You know something, Willis?

08:28.853 --> 08:31.511
For once in your life,
you're right.
I feel much better now.

08:32.373 --> 08:33.754
Me, too.

08:33.892 --> 08:36.101
That's the whole point,
you see?

08:36.239 --> 08:39.829
You've gotten rid of
that anger. Now you can
speak freely and easily.

08:39.967 --> 08:43.384
And clear up any problem,
no matter how big
without fighting.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.317
Good. Is this what
they do at those meetings?

08:45.455 --> 08:46.802
Oh, sometimes.

08:46.940 --> 08:48.528
Well me and Weezy
ain't gotta go then.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.391
When we get uptight,
we'll just beat
each other's brains in.

08:52.739 --> 08:55.811
That's not fair
because Louise
will always finish first.

09:01.437 --> 09:02.783
Well, I guess we can go now.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.716
May we have our potakas back?

09:04.854 --> 09:08.202
No, wait a minute.
I got one little teeny piece
of anger to get rid of yet.

09:09.203 --> 09:10.411
Oh, go ahead,
let her have it.

09:10.895 --> 09:11.861
Ow!

09:12.828 --> 09:14.036
Hey, you can't do that!

09:14.174 --> 09:15.589
Why not? You said
it's good for everybody.

09:15.727 --> 09:16.694
That's right.

09:17.936 --> 09:19.489
Oh, George, I'm gonna
do something.

09:32.088 --> 09:34.056
Stop it! Stop it, I said!

09:36.679 --> 09:39.199
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves, fighting like
that on the Lord's day!

09:41.477 --> 09:43.997
Florence, how would you
like it if I never got
mad at you again?

09:44.135 --> 09:45.308
That would be a blessing.

09:45.446 --> 09:46.620
And how would you like it
if you never got mad at me?

09:46.758 --> 09:47.863
Now that would be a miracle.

09:48.001 --> 09:50.037
Okay, stay right there
a minute.

09:58.528 --> 09:59.599
There.

10:08.538 --> 10:10.748
I wish I had a club right now
I could hit that crook with.

10:10.886 --> 10:13.095
What's he doing out there
anyway? Messing up the place?

10:13.233 --> 10:15.580
Don't worry about that.
Florence will help me
straighten it up.

10:16.719 --> 10:19.757
Hey, remember when
we first hired Florence?

10:19.895 --> 10:20.861
Yeah.

10:25.107 --> 10:26.246
But there's just one thing.

10:27.212 --> 10:28.973
Do you folks mind if
I ask you something?

10:29.111 --> 10:30.630
No, go right ahead.

10:30.768 --> 10:32.804
Now you live in
this apartment, right?
Uh-huh.

10:32.942 --> 10:35.807
And you got an apartment
in this building, too?
Yes, that's right.

10:37.015 --> 10:39.500
Well, how come we overcame
and nobody told me?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.549
Yeah. And now nobody can't
tell her nothing.

10:53.687 --> 10:56.621
Anyway, I'm glad I loaned
Florence my earrings tonight.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.830
At least they won't
get stolen.

10:58.968 --> 11:01.764
Yeah. I wish she was wearing
the TV set.

11:03.317 --> 11:04.836
Somebody's at the door.

11:04.974 --> 11:07.183
Oh, thank God.
Maybe we're saved.

11:07.321 --> 11:09.358
With our luck, it's probably
the Avon lady calling.

11:19.989 --> 11:21.957
Okay, Weezy, it looks like
we gotta do it
all by ourselves.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.165
Let's work on these ropes.

11:26.237 --> 11:27.583
Oh, it, it's no use.

11:28.549 --> 11:30.413
They won't budge.

11:30.551 --> 11:33.554
Four years in the Navy
learning how to tie knots.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.039
How come they don't teach you
how to untie them?

11:37.455 --> 11:40.078
I don't like to think
about your Navy days.

11:40.216 --> 11:43.150
That was the longest
we've ever been apart.

11:43.288 --> 11:45.221
Well then think of the
good part when I came
home on leave.

11:47.603 --> 11:49.985
Yeah, just you and me.

11:51.055 --> 11:53.816
We sure did a lot
of walking in the park.

11:53.954 --> 11:55.853
And a lot of resting
in the bushes.

11:59.097 --> 12:02.825
Sometimes I think a hot dog
at Coney Island was more fun

12:02.963 --> 12:05.310
than the fancy restaurants
we go to now.

12:05.448 --> 12:08.935
Oh, don't be silly, Weezy.
Being rich is much more fun.

12:09.073 --> 12:12.490
You don't like remembering
when you were poor,
do you, George?

12:12.628 --> 12:16.563
That's why you have
those nightmares anytime
something goes wrong.

12:16.701 --> 12:19.600
Well, now that that's
all cleared up,
don't you feel better now?

12:19.739 --> 12:22.500
No! 'Cause that's
the good part of the dream.

12:25.261 --> 12:27.816
I kept slipping down
that ladder,
and then all of a sudden

12:27.954 --> 12:29.438
I was in the subway.

12:29.576 --> 12:33.166
Did you have a token,
or did you sneak in
under the turnstile?

12:33.304 --> 12:35.685
I fell in through the roof,
right into the middle of
the A train!

12:36.963 --> 12:38.343
It was full of zebras.

12:42.865 --> 12:46.041
I mean, there was
zebras everywhere.
Snorting, and stomping,

12:46.179 --> 12:47.525
and chewing and messing up
the place.

12:47.663 --> 12:49.976
Weezy, ain't nothing uglier
than an A train
full of zebras.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.807
I'm not gonna explain
that one to you, George.

12:55.153 --> 12:56.741
And then at the first stop
I got off,

12:57.535 --> 12:59.364
and I ran onto
the up escalator,

12:59.502 --> 13:01.953
only it was going down.
Somebody switched signs on me.

13:02.091 --> 13:04.093
Cause right next to me was
a down escalator

13:04.231 --> 13:06.406
with a bottle of champagne
with a white label on it.

13:06.544 --> 13:08.270
And the bottle
was going up, up, up.

13:08.408 --> 13:11.066
And I was going down,
down, down.

13:11.204 --> 13:12.722
And at the bottom, you ain't
gonna believe this, Weezy.

13:14.414 --> 13:17.175
At the bottom was
all of these cockroaches,

13:17.313 --> 13:19.626
yelling and waving,
"Welcome back, George."

13:25.011 --> 13:25.943
Weezy...

13:26.702 --> 13:27.807
George...
Weezy!

13:31.189 --> 13:32.742
Where were you?

13:32.881 --> 13:34.434
Here.
Why wasn't you there?

13:35.780 --> 13:37.437
Where?
In my dream! I needed you!

13:38.783 --> 13:40.612
Oh, you had a nightmare.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.614
The worst.

13:42.752 --> 13:44.202
I was walking down the street
and everybody was
the same color.

13:46.515 --> 13:47.757
It was terrible.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.898
Why?

13:50.036 --> 13:52.003
Because I couldn't tell
the white blacks from
the black blacks.

13:53.763 --> 13:54.764
Oh, George.

13:54.903 --> 13:56.594
Wait, that's just
the beginning.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.527
Then suddenly everybody
started chasing me.

13:58.665 --> 14:00.701
And I ran and ran until
I got to Monticello,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.600
in the midst of
this great big party.

14:02.738 --> 14:05.085
And Thomas Jefferson was there
playing the violin.

14:09.572 --> 14:10.884
Well, what's so bad
about that?

14:12.092 --> 14:13.369
He was using me as the bow.

14:16.131 --> 14:19.065
Scraping me back and forth.
Back and forth,
back and forth.

14:20.342 --> 14:21.895
Did you sound good?

14:22.033 --> 14:24.794
Terrible. Only thing
he could play was "Dixie."

14:27.832 --> 14:28.833
Go to sleep, George.

14:29.489 --> 14:30.628
Okay.

14:30.766 --> 14:32.009
What are you doing?

14:32.147 --> 14:33.251
This time you're going
with me.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.223
You know, Weezy, when you
got it as good as we do,

14:39.361 --> 14:41.501
you don't like to think back
because you're afraid
it's gonna hurt.

14:41.639 --> 14:45.091
But it don't hurt at all.
I mean, we got a lot to think
back on, don't we?

14:45.229 --> 14:48.404
Yeah. Even the bad times
seem good at a time
like this.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.959
Hmm. Even old Archie Bunker
would look good to me now.

14:53.237 --> 14:55.515
Remember when we moved in
next door to him?

14:56.654 --> 14:58.173
Oh...

14:58.311 --> 15:00.106
You know what just crossed
my mind?

15:00.244 --> 15:01.521
Remember old man McNab?

15:01.659 --> 15:03.350
Yeah.
He used to live down
the street there?

15:03.488 --> 15:05.939
Remember the time that
he was gonna sell his place
to them Jews?

15:06.077 --> 15:07.768
Oh.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.219
And you come around with
that petition to
all the rest of us to sign.

15:10.357 --> 15:11.738
Remember to keep them out?

15:11.876 --> 15:13.360
And we all signed it, huh?
Yeah.

15:14.637 --> 15:17.295
You really saved the block
that time, Jim.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.194
Well, you know me.

15:19.332 --> 15:21.610
So, I mean, you wouldn't
then turn around

15:21.748 --> 15:23.957
and, and do what McNab
was trying to do, would you?

15:24.095 --> 15:25.648
You mean sell to Jews?
Yeah.

15:25.786 --> 15:26.995
Oh, no.

15:28.341 --> 15:29.342
No.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.104
These people are Baptists.
Right, right.

15:35.279 --> 15:36.625
Oh, that's nice.

15:36.763 --> 15:39.766
Hello, Mr. Bowman,
I just talked with
the telephone company,

15:39.904 --> 15:41.975
and they're putting
my phone in today.

15:42.113 --> 15:44.046
Now I really believe the house
is mine.

15:44.805 --> 15:46.290
Oh, hi, neighbor.

15:56.438 --> 15:57.404
Archie...

16:00.028 --> 16:01.857
My, you got here early.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.273
Well, I wanted to get
right to work.

16:04.411 --> 16:08.553
Oh, by the way, would it be
too much trouble to borrow
a pail from you?

16:08.691 --> 16:10.659
I forgot to bring one.
Oh, sure.

16:10.797 --> 16:12.833
Oh, you got your work cut out
for you.

16:12.972 --> 16:17.562
I don't think that house
has been cleaned since
his wife died three years ago.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.047
And way before that.

16:19.185 --> 16:21.359
Bowman and his wife
was always slobs,
the both of them.

16:22.809 --> 16:24.949
Archie. I'll get the pail.

16:25.087 --> 16:26.054
Thank you.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.803
Hurry up in there,
will you, Edith?

17:00.157 --> 17:01.192
Well then,

17:02.400 --> 17:04.161
how'd you like the Julia show
last night?

17:08.855 --> 17:11.547
Fine.
How did you like Doris Day?

17:13.411 --> 17:15.689
Oh, you're in!
No, I ain't. I'm out.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.898
But you're on my stoop.
That's the same as
being in my house.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.659
Stoops don't count.

17:19.797 --> 17:22.144
Stoops always count.
Stoops never count.
Don't turn your back on me!

17:22.282 --> 17:24.353
Oh, there you are.
Back in!

17:24.491 --> 17:26.976
Now, you're in,
you're in for sure.

17:27.115 --> 17:29.393
So finally,
the great Jefferson,

17:29.531 --> 17:32.948
who always reclined
to cross my threshold
is into the house.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.675
All duded up with a flower
in his lapel there.

17:35.813 --> 17:38.022
Or is that one of them things
that squirt in your eye?
No, it's real.

17:41.198 --> 17:42.682
I wear a fresh one every day.

17:42.820 --> 17:46.030
Oh, you don't blow money
on a fresh flower every day.

17:46.168 --> 17:49.240
No, I steal one every day
from a blind flower girl.

17:49.378 --> 17:51.346
Oh, he's joking.

17:51.484 --> 17:53.589
George, they don't
know you here. He's joking.

17:54.003 --> 17:55.074
Louise.

17:56.937 --> 17:58.318
I'll tell them
when I'm joking.

17:59.216 --> 18:00.182
I was joking.

18:01.010 --> 18:03.806
Archie, are you in bed yet?

18:03.944 --> 18:06.913
ARCHIE: No, not yet, Edith,
I'm looking out the window.

18:07.051 --> 18:08.846
You know, the Jeffersons
left their shades up.

18:10.606 --> 18:13.782
Did you know they was putting
new wallpaper on the wall
of their bedroom?

18:14.783 --> 18:17.889
Holy cow, them coloreds
are wild about stripes.

18:21.997 --> 18:23.274
Bunker, come down here!

18:25.207 --> 18:26.967
ARCHIE: That don't sound like
your voice, Edith.

18:28.797 --> 18:33.042
No, Archie, we got company.
Yeah, so I see.

18:33.974 --> 18:35.114
Thanks for letting me know.

18:36.529 --> 18:38.047
Yeah, those Bunkers were
something else, weren't they?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.879
Yeah. But I still miss Edith.

18:42.017 --> 18:45.503
She was so upset
when we moved out
of the neighborhood.

18:45.641 --> 18:49.473
Louise? I bought you
some fruit for your trip.

18:51.682 --> 18:53.235
We're only going to Manhattan.

18:54.443 --> 18:57.308
Well, subways break down
sometimes.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.038
Well, Edith,

19:03.176 --> 19:05.454
I guess this is
really goodbye.

19:07.629 --> 19:08.595
I know.

19:09.976 --> 19:12.461
Well, I'll just say so long.

19:13.324 --> 19:14.291
So long, Edith.

19:17.225 --> 19:18.191
Louise,

19:20.676 --> 19:21.988
did I ever tell you

19:23.231 --> 19:24.335
I love you?

19:25.785 --> 19:28.339
Every minute
we've spent together.

19:34.759 --> 19:35.933
You'd better go now,

19:37.279 --> 19:39.488
before the both of us
get awful wet.

19:41.490 --> 19:42.629
Bye, Louise.

19:48.325 --> 19:50.430
I mean, so long.

19:57.817 --> 19:59.508
What seems to be
the hold up in here?

19:59.646 --> 20:01.061
You still haven't finished
packing yet?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.580
Uh, just one more thing.

20:03.063 --> 20:04.789
Your coffee mug.

20:04.927 --> 20:06.515
I won't be drinking out
of mugs no more.

20:08.379 --> 20:11.071
From now on,
it's cups and saucers
all the way.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.901
Come on, Louise,
the limousine is waiting.

20:17.423 --> 20:18.631
Limousine?

20:19.839 --> 20:21.116
Have you gone crazy?

20:21.254 --> 20:22.738
What do we need
a limousine for?

20:22.876 --> 20:25.258
Because we're gonna leave
Bunkersville in style.

20:27.295 --> 20:28.848
Come on, Weezy.

20:28.986 --> 20:30.643
Things are looking good
for us.

20:30.781 --> 20:33.162
Look, you deserve the best.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.752
And that's exactly what
you're gonna get. The best.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.961
Okay?

20:40.135 --> 20:41.136
Here.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.281
I wish that chump out there
would move to
a new neighborhood.

20:49.662 --> 20:51.250
Oh, I just thought of
something awful.

20:52.181 --> 20:53.562
Worse than him?

20:53.700 --> 20:56.772
Yeah, what will happen if
we want to go to the bathroom?

20:58.084 --> 20:59.154
I wish you hadn't said that.
