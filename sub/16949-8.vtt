{\an8}<i>Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:</i>
<i>Hollywood..."</i>

00:05.872 --> 00:08.208
{\an7}So what about you?
You dealing with anybody else?

00:08.274 --> 00:10.410
{\an8}It's not like, oh, I have
another man or whatever,

00:10.477 --> 00:11.711
{\an8}it's just, I'm working.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.980
{\an8}Don't get your feelings
caught up in one.

00:14.047 --> 00:17.951
{\an8}If she with somebody else,
you gotta demand both.

00:18.017 --> 00:20.720
{\an8}I want whatever you have.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.389
{\an8}I want the both of y'all.

00:22.455 --> 00:24.157
{\an8}What do I have to do ?

00:24.224 --> 00:26.659
{\an7}I just--
I need you to be there.

00:26.726 --> 00:29.262
{\an8}I promise to be here through
this whole journey with you.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.930
{\an8}I will not let
you down, okay?

00:30.997 --> 00:33.933
{\an8}I want my dad
to walk me down the aisle.

00:30.997 --> 00:33.933
{\an4}Okay.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.336
{\an7}Even though I don't really
have a relationship with him.

00:36.403 --> 00:38.071
{\an7}It's a really
important moment.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.939
{\an7}I think every woman
waits for it.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.674
{\an8}If you're not into
planning the wedding,

00:41.741 --> 00:43.410
{\an8}why not get married now?

00:43.476 --> 00:45.078
{\an7}Cut the bull (bleep).
I'm gonna make it work.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.380
{\an8}You want me to be 50%?

00:45.145 --> 00:47.380
{\an9}Yes.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.382
{\an8}You about to get 5,000%.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.984
{\an7}I've heard
about your wife.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.153
{\an8}I do know that she popped up

00:53.219 --> 00:54.888
{\an7}on studio sessions,
things like that.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.824
{\an7}It's not gonna be an issue
with her, let me deal with her.

00:54.954 --> 00:57.824
{\an4}Okay.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.959
{\an8}I'm trying to understand
what the (bleep) this is.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.995
{\an8}A session.

01:00.026 --> 01:01.995
{\an8}This is my husband's session.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.830
{\an7}If I say there's no session,
there will be no session.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.666
{\an8}That's not true.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.666
{\an7}So you better stop talking
(bleep), little girl.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.401
{\an7}All we want to know
is the truth at this point.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.502
{\an8}Why are you here?

01:09.569 --> 01:11.805
{\an8}I was still in love
with you!

01:12.939 --> 01:14.174
{\an8}I got your letter.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.708
{\an7}It said you want to step away
from your marriage.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.811
{\an8}You just gotta respect
that (bleep).

After Princess brought
that white lady to the store

01:56.316 --> 02:00.286
{\an8}and almost forced me to elope
right on the spot, I got it.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.955
I need to be there
for my baby girl.

02:02.021 --> 02:04.457
{\an1}All right, so you told me
to bring a list,

02:04.524 --> 02:06.793
{\an1}you told me to be prepared,
you told me to focus.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.862
{\an1}I'm focused.
And everybody from the family

02:08.928 --> 02:13.433
{\an1}to my relatives, security,
production crews.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.535
I also got people
that I work with

02:15.602 --> 02:17.437
{\an1}that's been there with me
since day one

02:17.504 --> 02:19.639
{\an1}that's believed in me through
my trials and tribulations.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.875
I'm happy that you
put a list together

02:21.941 --> 02:24.210
and I'm glad that you did
what I asked you to do.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.378
Yeah.

02:25.445 --> 02:27.113
But five pages?

02:27.180 --> 02:29.616
{\an1}You have way too many people
on your list.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.951
I can't be mad
and she can't be mad either,

02:32.018 --> 02:33.853
that I got so many
goddamn friends.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.355
I got love, people love me.

02:35.421 --> 02:38.291
Eve, barber,
Antonio, website...

02:38.358 --> 02:39.826
{\an8}This ain't even all his friends.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.262
{\an8}I mean, he even got
his damn dentist on here.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.831
{\an1}I mean, I can't tell
these people they can't come.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.299
{\an1}I already told them
they coming.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.903
Well, they haven't got
an invitation yet.

02:49.969 --> 02:53.706
I'm, like, jealous because
you have so many people

02:53.773 --> 02:56.376
on your guest list
and, like, mine

02:56.442 --> 02:59.445
is, like, all sad
and lonely.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.947
I don't even know

03:01.014 --> 03:03.116
{\an1}if half the people on there
is even gonna come.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.419
Like, my mom...

03:06.486 --> 03:08.821
my dad, I don't know
if he's gonna come.

03:08.888 --> 03:11.424
My relationship with my parents
hasn't always been easy.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.026
Growing up as a teenager,

03:13.092 --> 03:15.061
I didn't live with either one
of my parents.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.797
My mom and I's relationship
has gotten a lot better.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.300
Now, when it comes to my dad,
that's a different story.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.101
We barely talk.

03:22.168 --> 03:24.037
{\an1}Have you even talked to,
like, your family about it?

03:24.103 --> 03:26.139
{\an1}Have you talked to your dad
about what kind of roles

03:26.205 --> 03:27.473
they wanna play, like...

03:27.540 --> 03:30.677
I don't really talk
to my dad like that.

03:30.743 --> 03:33.813
{\an1}And it's not that he doesn't
have access to me.

03:33.880 --> 03:39.052
He's always been around,
but never been there.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.287
{\an1}That's crazy.
How does that happen?

03:41.354 --> 03:43.156
I don't know.

03:43.222 --> 03:46.225
{\an1}I couldn't imagine not talking
to my dad for ten years,

03:46.292 --> 03:48.695
{\an1}or even two, three days.
I hit Pops, like, you know.

03:48.761 --> 03:49.929
I don't know.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.532
Like, why do I have
to come after you?

03:52.599 --> 03:56.169
{\an1}Why do I have to chase you?
You're my dad.

03:56.235 --> 03:59.639
A girl's family usually
rallies around her

03:59.706 --> 04:01.574
around the time
she's getting married

04:01.641 --> 04:05.945
and I just know that I'm not
gonna have those moments.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.381
I went and met with
the wedding planner

04:08.448 --> 04:11.551
and she was asking me

04:11.618 --> 04:13.386
{\an1}who was gonna walk me
down the aisle, and I, like--

04:13.453 --> 04:17.589
{\an1}I broke down and got sad...
because I don't know.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.425
I know a lot of the struggles
that Princess

04:19.492 --> 04:22.060
has been going through
is because she has been let down

04:22.128 --> 04:25.198
by her parents all the time.
As her future husband,

04:25.264 --> 04:29.135
it's my job to make sure that
she knows that she has a family

04:29.202 --> 04:30.937
that's gonna support her
and love her,

04:31.004 --> 04:33.172
even if it's not
her blood family.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.608
She got family here
and we'll take care of her

04:35.675 --> 04:38.011
and we'll love her the way
she's supposed to be loved.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.747
{\an1}This is my job, you know,
to make sure that I--

04:40.813 --> 04:43.216
{\an1}I make sure I connect the dots.
What's up with--

04:43.282 --> 04:45.985
{\an1}What's up with your grandma?
Did you talk to her?

04:46.052 --> 04:47.687
How's she feeling
about the wedding?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.455
I mean, she's happy,
she's excited

04:49.522 --> 04:52.425
and she wants to come,
but she's always sick,

04:52.492 --> 04:55.028
she can't travel alone
by herself.

04:55.094 --> 04:59.065
My grandma is the closest family
member to me on my dad's side

04:59.132 --> 05:01.601
and it would mean the world
to me if she came to my wedding.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.002
I got your back, okay?

05:03.069 --> 05:04.537
{\an1}This is gonna be
a traditional wedding

05:04.604 --> 05:06.172
and in traditional weddings,

05:06.239 --> 05:08.441
{\an1}everybody has
their family there.

05:08.508 --> 05:12.545
{\an1}Moms, dads, cousins,
grandmothers.

05:12.612 --> 05:13.579
Okay?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.648
Okay.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.083
I'm gonna do what I can, okay?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.117
{\an3}Okay.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.752
And I love you.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.752
Love you, too.

Me and Shanda,
we in a crazy space.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.950
{\an8}I'm coming home, she's there.
But it's like she's not.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.518
{\an8}I gotta repair this

05:52.585 --> 05:54.454
{\an8}and I just need some help
on just figuring out

05:54.520 --> 05:56.155
what I'm supposed to be doing
at this moment.

05:56.222 --> 05:57.857
What up, dog?

05:57.924 --> 05:59.325
(bleep) sounded good, boy.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.127
Appreciate it, man.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.662
Working, huh?

06:02.729 --> 06:05.098
{\an1}Yeah, man, trying to, you know,
get my mind back right,

06:05.164 --> 06:08.034
get in the studio, keep it
in the booth, you feel me?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.669
{\an1}I heard that, yeah, yeah.
Sounded good, though.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.971
{\an5}She sound good as hell.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.971
Good looking, man.
What's been up with you?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.806
{\an1}Just grinding out
all this damn music.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.374
{\an1}Man, I've been going through
so much (bleep).

06:15.441 --> 06:17.944
{\an5}What's happening?

06:15.441 --> 06:17.944
I'm in the dog house.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.545
{\an3}Nah, man.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.180
This shorty from Chicago, man,

06:21.247 --> 06:23.149
{\an1}she done brought her ass
all the way here to L.A., man,

06:23.216 --> 06:24.817
{\an1}and tried to (bleep)
all my (bleep) up, man.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.220
Wait. Somebody you
been talking to?

06:27.286 --> 06:30.056
{\an1}No, I wasn't talking to her,
it's just a chick from the past,

06:30.123 --> 06:31.824
{\an1}and then late last year,
you know,

06:31.891 --> 06:33.993
{\an1}she hit me up and got
into some freaky (bleep),

06:34.060 --> 06:36.195
{\an1}and I bit and I went,
like a dumb mother (bleep).

06:36.262 --> 06:38.397
I haven't confided in any
my friends, 'cause for one,

06:38.464 --> 06:41.134
this (bleep) is extremely
embarrassing, and for two,

06:41.200 --> 06:42.735
I was hoping it'd just
blow itself over

06:42.802 --> 06:44.203
and let me get back
to the good part,

06:44.270 --> 06:45.838
but clearly,
that's not happening.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.507
My marriage is definitely
in jeopardy,

06:47.573 --> 06:49.509
so right now,
I just need a friend.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.644
Have the kids
sensed anything?

06:51.711 --> 06:53.579
{\an1}I know they do, man,
I know they sitting there

06:53.646 --> 06:56.482
{\an1}and just watching the vibe,
like, why y'all ain't hugging?

06:56.549 --> 06:58.851
{\an5}Y'all ain't kissing.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.851
{\an3}Right, man.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.387
{\an5}(Fizz)
Watching Willie go through this
right now is really hard,

07:01.454 --> 07:04.257
{\an8}because I just know how much
of a good dude he really is

07:04.323 --> 07:06.392
{\an8}and how much he supports
and loves his family,

07:06.459 --> 07:09.629
{\an8}so it kinda-- it kinda makes me
just really feel bad for him.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.631
{\an1}I'm finna do something
real special for her, man.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.266
{\an1}I'm finna put a smile
on her face.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.935
{\an1}You know exactly what you could
do or what you gotta do.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.271
{\an1}I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna do anything it take.

07:18.337 --> 07:21.073
Go pick her up, book
that room on the water,

07:21.140 --> 07:23.042
go have some dinner,
come back,

07:23.109 --> 07:26.345
{\an1}have the candles already lit,
rose pedals out everywhere.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.114
Let her know you really
care about her

07:28.181 --> 07:29.749
like she's too important
to you,

07:29.816 --> 07:32.151
{\an1}and that's what you gotta do is
just make her feel important.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.553
{\an1}I have to.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.553
{\an3}Man.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.488
{\an1}I'm finna do something, though.
Gonna go get some roses.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.556
{\an4}Something.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.556

08:04.217 --> 08:05.451
Cute.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.486
I'm happy that Masika's
coming to visit me.

08:07.553 --> 08:10.623
She's my fellow MILF
and she's a bad bitch.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.258
Thank you guys,
I'm gonna take a break

08:12.325 --> 08:14.360
and talk to my main ho.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.429
Sika, Sika.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.429
{\an3}Yes.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.030
And we shall
reconvene-a-veena.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.066
{\an5}Yes, that was cute.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.066
Hello, bitch.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.335
{\an5}I like the song.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.335
Well, thank you.

08:22.401 --> 08:25.504
{\an1}So, aside from the song, bitch,
what else is going on?

08:25.571 --> 08:27.907
So I'm in the studio
with Max Lux, right?

08:27.974 --> 08:29.442
Yes.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.177
You were in the studio
with the grill master?

08:31.244 --> 08:33.479
We decided to get back
in the studio,

08:33.546 --> 08:35.047
and girl, in the middle
of the session,

08:35.114 --> 08:38.784
{\an1}we jamming out, bitch, and
in walked this rabid Chihuahua.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.453
Bitch coming in...
Yip-yip! Yip-yip!

08:40.519 --> 08:42.221
Yip-yip-yip-yip!
And then she's like,

08:42.288 --> 08:44.190
well, what is this,
what's going on?

08:44.256 --> 08:45.358
And I'm like, well,
what does it look like?

08:45.424 --> 08:46.525
It's a studio session.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.793
Well, this wasn't
on my calendar.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.162
The bitch came in
like a wrecking ball.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.465
{\an1}I'm sorry that
that happened to you,

08:52.531 --> 08:54.500
{\an4}but on the flip side
of the coin...

08:52.531 --> 08:54.500
Girl.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.536
{\an1}It actually is great that
you're telling me this story,

08:57.603 --> 08:58.938
because now we can get on

08:59.005 --> 09:00.873
{\an1}in this double revenge plot
because, so--

09:00.940 --> 09:03.042
{\an5}I was trying not to do it.

09:00.940 --> 09:03.042
{\an1}Don't.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.744
So let me tell you.

09:04.810 --> 09:07.980
{\an1}This random girl reaches out
to me in my DMs.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.983
{\an1}Lo and behold,
Max Lux had a becky.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.919
{\an5}Short version of events, bitch.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.919
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.488
{\an1}She used to hang out
with Max occasionally.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.190
{\an1}Brandi knew that Max
and the becky used to kick it,

09:18.257 --> 09:20.927
she went looking for Max
at the becky's apartment.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.162
She gets caught by Brandi.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.864
Brandi hops through the window,

09:24.931 --> 09:27.466
{\an1}like the rabid Chihuahua,
as you put it.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.501
She gave her rabies.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.036
You get what I'm saying.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.104
{\an8}Seeing the way Brandi carries on
and treats Max

09:32.171 --> 09:35.474
{\an8}like he's a child, I can see him
calling becky five days a week.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.743
Becky!
Becky.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.781
{\an1}I'm gonna do my best to get
my hands on this police report

09:41.847 --> 09:45.785
{\an1}and then I'm thinking
about having a listening party

09:45.851 --> 09:49.255
and I would like to invite
the likes of the Chihuahua.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.123
Wait.

09:51.190 --> 09:54.560
{\an1}Why bring her to your event
to (bleep) it up?

09:54.627 --> 09:56.762
Well, because I'll
have plenty more.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.931
{\an1}It's time to say (bleep)
the peace treaty.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.300
{\an1}Hopefully, this destroys
her marriage.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.135
{\an5}I hope it does.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.135
It's already destroyed,
apparently.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.571
{\an1}I hope this puts the nail
in the mother (bleep) coffin

10:05.638 --> 10:08.007
and I hope it exposes you
for being the (bleep) mom

10:08.074 --> 10:09.809
{\an1}and the (bleep) wife
that you are.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.310
See, this is why Moniece
is always

10:11.377 --> 10:12.678
in the middle of some mess.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.447
She takes something so small

10:14.513 --> 10:16.248
like the puppy barking at me
in the studio

10:16.315 --> 10:18.084
and blows it up
into this huge revenge plot,

10:18.150 --> 10:20.086
when in all actuality,
I don't even care.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.954
Nowadays that
I'm such a busy mom,

10:22.021 --> 10:23.789
the only mess I have time for

10:23.856 --> 10:26.158
is what comes out the front
or back end of my child.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.160
{\an1}And so I need you
at my listening party.

10:28.227 --> 10:29.962
She gonna Tasmanian Devil
through that bitch.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.630
{\an1}That's all right.
That's what the muzzle,

10:31.697 --> 10:33.699
{\an1}the harness, the leash, the
collar and the dog tag are for.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.702
Brandi's bitch ass decided
to hop on the bad mom bandwagon,

10:36.769 --> 10:40.706
and I've taken it upon myself to
use every opportunity possible

10:40.773 --> 10:42.875
to bring this bitch down
just a notch,

10:42.942 --> 10:45.911
even if it's at the expense
of my own listening event.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.047
Brandi's animal-style behavior
in this moment

10:48.114 --> 10:50.850
is a clear indication
that Max is a sore spot for her

10:50.916 --> 10:52.952
and I know exactly
what that feels like

10:53.019 --> 10:55.588
because she's constantly
attacking my motherhood.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.024
Girl, we finna (bleep) it up.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.092
{\an8}My girl, she says
she runs into Safaree.

11:00.159 --> 11:04.897
{\an8}She later on goes to him room
and then it all just went down.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.632
{\an8}What?

11:04.964 --> 11:06.632
{\an8}What, what did they do?

11:06.699 --> 11:07.900
{\an8}(bleep)

11:07.967 --> 11:09.502
{\an8}I don't want to be here.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.970
{\an8}I don't want to (bleep) be

11:11.037 --> 11:13.239
{\an8}a part of the bull (bleep)
no more.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.608
{\an8}Brandi went looking
for her husband

11:15.674 --> 11:18.377
{\an8}and then she attacked becky
and then she was arrested.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.748
{\an8}Now we got a problem,
bitch!

Normally brides
bring their mothers

11:59.318 --> 12:01.220
with them wedding dress shopping

12:01.287 --> 12:03.989
and although my mother and I's
relationship has improved,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.559
she lives far away,
so she can't be here.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.060
You look like a princess.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.495
{\an1}I look like a little
Catholic girl.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.697
You look cute.
Oh, my God.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.466
{\an5}I like the top part.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.466
{\an3}Yes.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.667
The top part
is really good.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.768
And the lace,
the lace is gorgeous.

12:15.835 --> 12:16.769
{\an8}Oh, my God,
you about to cry?

12:16.836 --> 12:19.405
{\an7}No.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.208
{\an1}I've cried enough,
I'm trying not to, okay?

12:22.274 --> 12:23.876
{\an5}Wow.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.876
I'm really, like,
shaking right now.

12:23.943 --> 12:27.680
It's real.
Oh, don't do that!

12:27.746 --> 12:29.815
♪ Da da ♪

12:29.882 --> 12:33.119
And although Sonja and Brandi
live here in L.A.,

12:33.185 --> 12:36.355
I thought that inviting them
would just make me more sad

12:36.422 --> 12:38.557
about my own mother
not being here,

12:38.624 --> 12:40.459
so I decided to invite
my best friends.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.595
It just doesn't feel real.

12:42.661 --> 12:44.930
It's like a dream?

12:42.661 --> 12:44.930
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

12:44.997 --> 12:47.266
You deserve it.
Every bit of it.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.303
Going over this guest list
with Ray

12:51.370 --> 12:53.339
has me kind of in my feelings

12:53.405 --> 12:57.977
because my family isn't as close
to me as Ray's family is to him.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.479
You're so cute.

13:00.546 --> 13:01.914
What do you feel
about this one?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.415
{\an5}This one's bigger.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.415
It is bigger, right?

13:03.482 --> 13:04.984
{\an1}I'm sorry,
the other one took the cake.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.785
{\an1}It kind of took a little shine
from that one.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.221
{\an1}I should have put that one
on last.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.190
{\an1}Yeah, no.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.659
Ha ha!
Look who it is.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.361
{\an3}Oh.

13:15.427 --> 13:18.430
Oh, my God.
What is Ray doing here?

13:18.497 --> 13:20.699
I mean, I know I told him
to come help out,

13:20.766 --> 13:22.001
but I didn't mean help me

13:22.067 --> 13:24.069
picking out my damn
wedding dress.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.538
You're not supposed
to be here.

13:25.604 --> 13:28.274
This ain't it,
this ain't the one anyway, okay?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.275
Why are you here?

13:29.341 --> 13:31.010
I want to be involved, baby.

13:31.076 --> 13:32.778
{\an1}I think you should worry
about what you're gonna wear

13:32.845 --> 13:34.480
and let us take care of this.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.915
Are you okay today?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.050
Listen, it's all
about making you happy,

13:38.117 --> 13:39.919
{\an5}so I got a surprise for you.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.919
{\an3}Cheers.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.622
A real surprise.
I'll be right back.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.258
{\an8}I know it's been
a lot of ups and downs

13:46.325 --> 13:48.694
{\an8}with Princess and her family,
but that don't mean

13:48.761 --> 13:51.430
{\an8}that the real people that love
her shouldn't be in her life.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.803
{\an1}(sobbing)

13:57.870 --> 13:59.205
{\an1}Nanny.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.644
{\an5}(Princess)
To actually have a member
of my family here

14:05.711 --> 14:08.547
while I'm picking out my dress
means so much to me.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.684
Ray doing this proves to me
once again

14:11.750 --> 14:13.953
that he's the man
that I need to marry.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.822
All right, well, I'm gonna
go ahead and go in the back

14:16.889 --> 14:18.190
And give you two a minute.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.124
{\an5}Love you, baby.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.124
Love you.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.559
{\an5}Okay.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.559
Thank you.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.995
Seeing my grandma
is the best feeling ever.

14:23.062 --> 14:27.333
I have no idea how he got her
here, but I am super touched.

14:27.399 --> 14:30.436
{\an1}I cannot believe
you're here right now.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.738
Take my hand.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.707
Have you spoke to my dad?

14:34.773 --> 14:36.709
He told me to tell you

14:36.775 --> 14:40.112
{\an1}that he loved you, even though
he is a drag sometimes.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.850
{\an1}So, it's--
it's important for me

14:44.917 --> 14:46.919
{\an1}that my dad walks me
down the aisle.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.355
It should be,
that's your father.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.358
{\an1}I haven't talked to him
in over a year

14:52.424 --> 14:57.263
{\an1}and before that, it--
it was about ten years.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.898
{\an1}I'm just afraid
that he might say no.

14:59.965 --> 15:03.168
Since my mom and dad split
when I was five years old,

15:03.235 --> 15:06.272
my dad hasn't really
came through for me.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.941
I'm hoping that my wedding
could be a start

15:09.008 --> 15:11.543
for me and my dad
to rebuild our relationship,

15:11.610 --> 15:13.812
but I can only do that
if he wants to.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.114
He wants to be here.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.583
He don't want anybody
taking his place.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.318
He said that's his job.

15:19.385 --> 15:21.720
That would make me happy.

15:21.787 --> 15:24.523
{\an1}I'll probably be crying
the whole way down.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.792
Yeah, he'll probably
be crying, too.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.527
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
that you're gonna be there.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.596
I wouldn't miss it.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.431
{\an1}And I don't think that I would
be able to get married

15:32.498 --> 15:33.732
without my family there.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.934
You can count on this side
of your family.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.374
{\an7}(Nikki)
You like the food?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.509
It's really good.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.010
Trying to be snatched,
like you.

15:45.077 --> 15:48.047
{\an8}After Lyrica's disastrous
housewarming party the other day

15:48.113 --> 15:51.016
{\an8}and that crazy mama drama,
I knew I had to take my girl out

15:51.083 --> 15:53.519
{\an8}to have little sips and
cocktails, 'cause sometimes,

15:53.585 --> 15:55.788
{\an8}that's all you need
to get your mind off stuff.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.523
Hi.

15:55.854 --> 15:57.523
{\an1}Hi, baby.

15:57.589 --> 15:58.957
How are you, baby?

15:57.589 --> 15:58.957
Good.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.726
{\an5}Phil, this is Lyrica.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.726
How are you?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
{\an5}Hi, Phil, Lyrica.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
Nice to meet you.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.662
Phil's my hairstylist.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.664
{\an3}Oh, lucky.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.467
When Nikki called me and asked
me to go to lunch with her,

16:08.534 --> 16:09.635
I was so happy.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.371
{\an8}It's nothing like drinks
and girl talk

16:12.438 --> 16:14.707
{\an8}to just clear my head from
everything that's been going on.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.875
I heard about you
and Safaree.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.210
{\an1}What did you hear
about me and Safaree?

16:18.277 --> 16:19.478
You know how I am,
you're my girl,

16:19.545 --> 16:20.946
so I'm not gonna go off
of what I heard,

16:21.013 --> 16:23.749
{\an1}I wanna hear it from the horse's
mouth, what's going on here?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.251
{\an1}Well, girl, I got myself
in some (bleep).

16:26.318 --> 16:28.754
Yeah, have a drink, okay?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.723
I was dating two people.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.191
{\an1}One of them happened
to be a girl

16:32.257 --> 16:34.460
{\an1}and one of them happened
to be Safaree.

16:34.526 --> 16:37.096
Who-- Wait, what?
What?

16:37.162 --> 16:39.164
Hold on, who's the girl?
For one?

16:39.231 --> 16:41.367
{\an1}I don't know if you know her.
This model.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.735
Her name is Rosa Acosta.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.002
Oh, yeah, she's fine.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.304
{\an5}Yeah, that bitch is fine.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.304
Bitch is poppin'.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.140
{\an1}So, girl, I had this event
that I'm hosting

16:48.207 --> 16:50.209
{\an1}and you know,
I'm in the back with Rosa

16:50.275 --> 16:51.977
{\an1}and I'm fixing my makeup
or whatever

16:52.044 --> 16:55.214
and we was kissing and Safaree
walks in on us kissing, bitch.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.982
What?
Oh, my gosh.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.486
{\an1}Girl, it took--
I was like...

17:00.552 --> 17:02.154
{\an1}Hey, Safaree.
I didn't know, bitch.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.689
What did he say,
what did you do?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.758
At the end of the day, girl, I'm
not in a committed relationship

17:05.824 --> 17:09.161
with either one, but you know,
I really do honestly feel bad

17:09.228 --> 17:11.296
{\an1}for Safaree because
he's such a nice guy.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.665
After Rosa made it a point
to bring a date to our event,

17:13.732 --> 17:14.933
I know that our relationship

17:15.000 --> 17:16.502
might be taking a slight break
right now,

17:16.568 --> 17:18.470
but that's okay because I been
thinking about Safaree a lot

17:18.537 --> 17:19.972
and I actually do
really miss him.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.708
{\an1}Honestly, I really, really,
really felt so bad,

17:22.775 --> 17:24.609
{\an1}like, I felt like
I really hurt this man

17:24.675 --> 17:27.813
that's so amazing
and loyal and...

17:29.148 --> 17:30.482
What?

17:30.549 --> 17:31.683
{\an8}Please don't be mad,

17:31.750 --> 17:33.786
{\an8}but I've been meaning
to tell you...

17:33.852 --> 17:36.021
{\an5}Been meaning to tell me...

17:33.852 --> 17:36.021
About Safaree.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.256
What?

17:37.322 --> 17:38.791
So my girl called me, right,

17:38.857 --> 17:41.860
and so she ends up spilling
this tea that she was in Miami.

17:41.927 --> 17:44.062
She say she runs into him,
and she's like,

17:44.129 --> 17:46.365
oh, yeah, you know, you Safaree,
whatever, whatever.

17:46.432 --> 17:50.636
So they chop it up and then...
it all just went down.

17:50.702 --> 17:52.337
{\an5}What?

17:50.702 --> 17:52.337
What did they do?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.639
(bleep)

17:53.705 --> 17:55.307
{\an5}They did it,
whatever, whatever.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.307
What?

17:55.374 --> 17:57.376
{\an5}Like, I don't know,
you know...

17:55.374 --> 17:57.376
You are lying to me, bitch.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.778
Here I am, trying to work
this relationship out,

17:59.845 --> 18:02.014
missing Safaree,
talking so nice about him

18:02.080 --> 18:04.716
and then Phil says, what?
What did I just hear?

18:04.783 --> 18:07.386
'Cause she said she was coming
out for business or whatever--

18:07.453 --> 18:09.421
Okay, so tell her I would
like to meet up with her,

18:09.488 --> 18:11.690
{\an1}because I'm a smart bitch,
okay?

18:11.757 --> 18:12.958
I know how to play games.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.193
Don't tell him nothing,
though.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.295
{\an1}I'm not.
Bitch, I'm an actress, too.

18:16.361 --> 18:18.530
{\an1}You wanna sit Safaree down?
You wanna sit who down?

18:18.597 --> 18:19.998
{\an4}Safaree and the bitch,
whatever--

18:18.597 --> 18:19.998
Girl.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.234
{\an1}Okay, the girl.
And just basically get a vibe.

18:22.301 --> 18:24.570
So if you get a vibe,
then what?

18:24.636 --> 18:25.637
Are you gonna cut him off?

18:25.704 --> 18:27.673
{\an1}I'm gonna just say,
look, be honest.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.141
{\an1}I will accept it
and we can move on,

18:29.208 --> 18:31.009
{\an1}but if you lie to me to my face,
now we got a problem.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.444
{\an4}I'll let y'all know
how that goes.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.444
Ooh, I'm scared for that.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.046
Let me know
how that goes, boo.

18:34.112 --> 18:36.081
{\an1}Girl, I'm ready.
You know I don't care.

18:43.755 --> 18:46.024
{\an8}Tonight is the night I just want
it to be me and my lady.

18:46.091 --> 18:47.459
{\an8}I want to talk directly
to her heart,

18:47.526 --> 18:49.695
{\an8}I want to let her know
exactly how I feel.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.263
I want her to know
exactly how sorry I am

18:51.330 --> 18:53.432
for hurting her and how,
you know,

18:53.499 --> 18:55.200
I'm never going to allow this
to happen to us again,

18:55.267 --> 18:56.802
and I want her to know that
and I want her to know

18:56.869 --> 18:58.237
that today,
I want to start anew.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.442
Hey, beautiful.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.811
{\an3}For real?

19:05.878 --> 19:08.013
Where'd this guy
come from?

19:08.080 --> 19:10.082
I'm not looking for too much.
I'm not thinking,

19:10.148 --> 19:12.050
let's go all the way
over the moon

19:12.117 --> 19:14.386
and then you just grab me back
and just, you know,

19:14.453 --> 19:16.121
say you love me and we go in
the house and make sweet love,

19:16.188 --> 19:17.523
even though I would love to,

19:17.589 --> 19:20.726
but I'm expecting at least
to just break the ice.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.094
Let me get through,
let me come in,

19:22.160 --> 19:23.529
let me step in front
of your heart,

19:23.595 --> 19:26.098
let me say my apology in front
of the heart, and just--

19:26.164 --> 19:27.900
Just let me know
if you accept it or not.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.969
Uh... I wish you would
have done more of this.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.539
{\an1}I've been trying
to do more of this.

19:33.605 --> 19:35.774
This is more like a...

19:35.841 --> 19:37.509
I'm sorry,
forgive me type (bleep).

19:37.576 --> 19:40.245
{\an1}Nah. This is more
just a happy place,

19:40.312 --> 19:41.747
which I want us to stay in.

19:41.813 --> 19:44.583
{\an1}I want to try to find it
and make it work.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.619
{\an1}I feel like you're doing this
because of what happened.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.955
I feel like you wouldn't
have done anything like it

19:50.022 --> 19:51.256
if I wouldn't have found out.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.958
{\an1}No.
That's not the case.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.793
That's how I feel.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.762
I just want to make everything
work, I just want to make it--

19:56.828 --> 19:58.063
{\an1}I want to show you
that I'm trying.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.933
{\an8}I deserve a man
that would do things like this

20:00.999 --> 20:03.135
{\an8}because he loves me
and he wants to see me happy,

20:03.201 --> 20:05.237
{\an8}not because he (bleep) up.

20:05.304 --> 20:08.373
{\an1}So you just want me to be able
to just pop back into, you know,

20:08.440 --> 20:10.609
what you should have
been doing anyway.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.044
{\an1}Nah, I don't want you
to pop back.

20:12.110 --> 20:13.211
Or pop back into
being the husband,

20:13.278 --> 20:15.013
the better man, like, why?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.915
Why, why did I have
to deal with, you know,

20:16.982 --> 20:18.617
that person
in the first place?

20:18.684 --> 20:20.085
Why did I have to deal
with the (bleep)

20:20.152 --> 20:22.521
that you put me through?

20:22.588 --> 20:25.390
I'm talking about the (bleep)
that you've allowed to happen.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.693
Again, you know, I apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.128
{\an1}I've already put myself
in your shoes a million times.

20:30.195 --> 20:32.164
I don't--
I don't want to be here.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.336
{\an1}I feel like all I've been doing
was fighting for this family

20:37.402 --> 20:38.870
'cause I know
that's important to me.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.106
Which-- why I put
my career on hold,

20:41.173 --> 20:43.041
and I felt like it was
the moment for me

20:43.108 --> 20:46.411
to step up and be a woman
and just make sure that,

20:46.478 --> 20:48.013
you know, family is priority

20:48.080 --> 20:51.016
{\an1}and I don't feel like family
was priority to you.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.551
Family is always my priority.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.321
{\an1}I don't feel like you've put in
the sacrifices I put in.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.625
See, I've forgiven Willie way
too many times, and for what?

20:59.691 --> 21:01.259
If he's gonna continue
to do the same (bleep)

21:01.326 --> 21:03.929
over and over again?
I hate to admit it,

21:03.996 --> 21:05.464
but I think it's time for me

21:05.530 --> 21:07.966
to focus on me for a change,
without Willie.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.201
I don't want to (bleep)

21:09.267 --> 21:11.236
{\an1}be a part of the bull (bleep)
no more.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.704
I don't feel like
it's fair to me,

21:12.771 --> 21:14.239
I don't feel like
it's fair to my kids.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.575
{\an1}I don't want my kids to think
that this (bleep) is okay.

21:16.642 --> 21:19.978
{\an1}You were supposed to be here,
setting an example for our kids

21:20.045 --> 21:25.183
{\an1}on how to be treated by a man
and how to treat a woman.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.785
And I feel like as far
as our marriage,

21:26.852 --> 21:28.086
I just feel like it needs
to be fixed,

21:28.153 --> 21:30.589
and it can't be fixed
together.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.727
(exhales)

21:34.159 --> 21:35.727
{\an3}(sniffles)

21:47.873 --> 21:51.610
{\an7}Did you get a direct message
from Moniece on Instagram?

21:51.677 --> 21:53.912
{\an9}No.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.381
{\an7}Nikki's saying she want
to meet up with me tomorrow.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.583
{\an7}Listen, if you need an ear bud
in your ear

21:58.650 --> 22:00.218
{\an7}and you need me to be,
like, watching...

22:00.285 --> 22:01.653
{\an8}Can we set that up?

22:19.938 --> 22:20.872
{\an1}Brandi.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.174
Hey!

22:22.240 --> 22:23.875
{\an3}Okay.

22:23.942 --> 22:25.577
Somebody is beautiful
and sexy as ever.

22:25.644 --> 22:26.912
{\an1}Thank you.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.547
Now that we're back
on the same page,

22:28.613 --> 22:31.383
all I've been doing is spending
time with Max and our son.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.252
I even missed Princess
wedding dress shopping,

22:34.319 --> 22:37.322
and I feel bad,
so I'm meeting her for drinks

22:37.389 --> 22:39.357
to make it up to her
and catch up.

22:39.424 --> 22:43.361
{\an1}Did you get a direct message
from Moniece on Instagram?

22:43.428 --> 22:46.064
{\an5}No.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.064
Check your messages.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.467
You and I were tagged in it.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.668
Are you sure?
Let me see.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.702
{\an1}Yes.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.370
It says "you are
cordially invited

22:52.437 --> 22:53.839
"to attend a listening party

22:53.905 --> 22:56.241
{\an1}for Moniece Slaughter's
new album, 'The Naked Truth.'"

22:56.308 --> 22:57.843
Details to follow.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.244
This is just--

22:59.311 --> 23:01.446
See, the fact that she
sent that is so awkward.

23:01.513 --> 23:04.216
{\an1}I feel like she's being funny.
Maybe we should go.

23:04.282 --> 23:06.318
{\an5}(Princess)
Things have been
really stressful

23:06.384 --> 23:08.653
{\an8}with the wedding planning
and just sorting out

23:08.720 --> 23:10.589
{\an8}all my feelings with my dad.

23:10.655 --> 23:11.857
{\an8}It's just been a lot.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.659
At this point, I really
just need a good laugh.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.729
{\an1}That is not going to be a sight
that's going to be okay,

23:17.796 --> 23:19.998
{\an5}you are in a good place
with your wedding.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.998
What are we gonna do?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.600
{\an6}I'm...

23:20.065 --> 23:21.600
She invited us.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.469
{\an5}You guys are at
a different place.

23:21.666 --> 23:24.469
Did she not invite us?

23:24.536 --> 23:25.971
That's a joke.

23:26.037 --> 23:29.541
{\an1}Okay, so we're gonna
accept the joke and go.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.444
{\an8}I don't know
what Ho-Niece's motive is,

23:32.511 --> 23:35.881
{\an8}but what I do know, it's
definitely some bull (bleep).

23:35.947 --> 23:38.517
But I'm gonna give in
to Princess

23:38.583 --> 23:41.620
and see what type of mess
Ho-Niece is up to.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.989
{\an5}Oh, I can't take...

23:41.686 --> 23:43.989
{\an1}Wait, doesn't she have a new
song out?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.423
The record wasn't so bad,

23:45.490 --> 23:47.926
but I couldn't get
off her mouth...

23:47.993 --> 23:50.729
Bad bitches bad bitches...
I'm a bad bitch,

23:50.796 --> 23:53.532
I'm a bad bitch...
Like, stop.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.634
{\an5}You are not a bad bitch.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.634
You're not a bad bitch.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.936
A bad bitch can walk out
with no makeup,

23:58.003 --> 24:00.939
bags under the eyes, but you
need to get your concealer,

24:01.006 --> 24:03.375
my (bleep), and you need
to get that (bleep) quick,

24:03.441 --> 24:06.611
and you better extra pack
that mother (bleep) on

24:06.678 --> 24:08.280
before you get up in here
talking about,

24:08.346 --> 24:11.216
'cause I'm a bad bitch and I've
been working on my album and...

24:11.283 --> 24:12.984
{\an1}You look mother (bleep) tired,
that's what you look.

24:13.051 --> 24:14.753
Yes.
And...

24:16.955 --> 24:20.358
Moniece, you know
you're not a bad bitch.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.228
You are a fraud.
Fraudulent!

24:23.295 --> 24:27.132
And these bad bitches in America
ought to sue your ass.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.767
{\an6}I'm in.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.767
Cheers to that.

24:28.834 --> 24:29.768
Yeah.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.575
{\an8}I got the wedding,
I want people sipping,

24:36.641 --> 24:37.976
{\an8}I want people feeling good.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.411
{\an8}Just 'cause I don't drink

24:39.477 --> 24:41.146
{\an7}don't mean people can't have
a good time and drink.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.514
And so at the end of the day,

24:42.581 --> 24:44.249
{\an1}I need y'all to help me
through the process.

24:44.316 --> 24:47.886
{\an1}That's the tropical Oohlavie.
You know what I'm saying?

24:47.953 --> 24:51.056
{\an5}(Ray J)
Listen, I told my baby girl
that I'm back in full effect,

24:51.122 --> 24:54.326
{\an8}I got the guest list together,
I got grandma out here

24:54.392 --> 24:56.027
{\an8}and it really touched her soul,

24:56.094 --> 24:57.362
{\an8}and now I'm going three
for three.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.965
I don't drink,
but I'm bringing the homeys in

25:00.031 --> 25:01.766
so they can do the drink tasting
for me.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.535
Your woman is always right.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.270
{\an1}That's why I want y'all
to drink.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.905
{\an1}The woman is always
right drink.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.740
{\an1}Okay, this is what
this is called.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.508
Oh, the woman
is always right?

25:10.575 --> 25:13.044
{\an1}Women are always
right drink, okay?

25:13.111 --> 25:15.547
{\an1}Drink it up, fellas.
Make sure you drink it all up.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.849
I ain't seen Safaree
since Venice Beach,

25:17.916 --> 25:19.751
since we was working out,
so I don't know really

25:19.818 --> 25:21.386
what's happening
and I really want to see

25:21.453 --> 25:23.355
if my plan was put to the test.

25:23.421 --> 25:25.957
{\an1}Run him the play.
Tell him who you with.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.059
First and foremost.

25:28.126 --> 25:30.595
{\an3}Nikki Baby.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.564
{\an5}That's what you doing?

25:30.662 --> 25:32.564
Yeah, that's what he doing?

25:32.631 --> 25:35.400
The other day, we was
at the beach, working out,

25:35.467 --> 25:37.435
{\an8}Ray is telling me,
you know,

25:37.502 --> 25:40.372
{\an8}he was hearing some little weird
funny things going on with her.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.107
{\an1}I heard Nikki
was messing around with Rosa.

25:42.173 --> 25:44.175
{\an5}Rosa Acosta?

25:42.173 --> 25:44.175
Yeah, Rosa Acosta.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.044
You went and talked to her
about the situation?

25:46.111 --> 25:47.445
{\an5}Better had have.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.445
Check this out.

25:47.512 --> 25:50.248
I ain't even check her
or ask her nothing, right?

25:50.315 --> 25:53.285
She has an event,
I walk into the room,

25:53.351 --> 25:55.320
my (bleep),
they in there kissing.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.789
{\an8}Oh, wow.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.789
{\an8}Oh, that's a movie.

25:57.856 --> 26:00.258
{\an1}What you do?
Make me proud, my (bleep).

26:00.325 --> 26:02.093
So look, I kinda
caught them off guard.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.129
They both looking at me
and I'm like...

26:04.195 --> 26:05.964
What's going on?
And it's so crazy,

26:06.031 --> 26:07.899
because, you know,
with Rosa...

26:07.966 --> 26:10.368
Rosa used to have, these,
like, DVDs back in the day

26:10.435 --> 26:11.937
and she used to shoot
her calendars,

26:12.003 --> 26:14.372
{\an1}so I'm looking at her, like,
damn, I used to, like...

26:14.439 --> 26:15.941
Jack off to her.

26:16.007 --> 26:18.310
{\an1}You used to jack off
looking at them pictures.

26:18.376 --> 26:19.678
And I'm not gonna lie,
the whole time,

26:19.744 --> 26:22.213
I had what you told me
in the back of my head.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.615
{\an1}Three words,
that's all you had to say.

26:23.682 --> 26:26.451
{\an1}So I just looked at her,
I said, I want what you got.

26:26.518 --> 26:31.189
{\an1}If we together, I want this.
I want it all.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.758
{\an1}You're saying it happened?
And you got it all?

26:33.825 --> 26:35.994
I didn't get it all.
I didn't get it all.

26:36.061 --> 26:39.998
{\an5}(Ray J)
Three simple words.
"I want it all."

26:40.065 --> 26:41.800
That's all you need, okay?

26:41.866 --> 26:44.569
You follow the play,
you score the touchdown.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.938
All he has to do is execute it.
But nah.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.173
He wanna call an audible.

26:48.239 --> 26:50.909
Rosa just starts
getting mad at me.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.210
She's going off on me.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.411
Oh, she start snapping?

26:53.478 --> 26:55.747
Bro, she was getting
a little hostile,

26:55.814 --> 26:57.282
like, her muscles
was just, like,

26:57.349 --> 26:59.017
{\an5}swelling up,
and I just was like...

26:57.349 --> 26:59.017
{\an1}Ew.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.652
I didn't want no issues.

27:00.719 --> 27:03.088
{\an1}Nikki got mad at me 'cause I
said I wanted the both of them,

27:03.154 --> 27:04.823
but you know, she hit me up,

27:04.889 --> 27:08.226
{\an1}she's saying she want
to meet up with me tomorrow.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.830
Man, I knew Ray's advice was
gonna blow up in Safaree's face.

27:11.896 --> 27:16.234
As of today, Ray is a faithful
man headed to the altar,

27:16.301 --> 27:19.871
but the Ray J that we know
from back in the days

27:19.938 --> 27:22.941
is not a dude that I would be
taking love advice from.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.310
{\an1}Listen, if you need
an ear bud in your ear

27:25.377 --> 27:27.746
{\an1}and you need me to be,
like, watching and giving you

27:27.812 --> 27:30.415
{\an1}advice from the beginning,
let me do it.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.983
Yo, you know what?
Listen.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.251
Can we set that up?

27:33.318 --> 27:36.755
{\an1}One earpiece, one night,
one try.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.657
I never was too sure about
Ray's advice from the jump,

27:39.724 --> 27:41.426
'cause we all see
how that played out,

27:41.493 --> 27:44.729
but you know, Ray and Soulja,
they're a bit more familiar

27:44.796 --> 27:47.432
with these Hollywood streets and
how these girls move out here,

27:47.499 --> 27:50.869
so I'm willing to try
the Ray way one more time.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.570
{\an1}Let us know if you wanna
get that ear bud,

27:52.637 --> 27:54.973
{\an1}but back to the wedding.
To me being faithful.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.909
Yo...
I'm proud of my brother, man.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.579
{\an8}Brandi went looking
for her husband

28:01.646 --> 28:05.984
{\an8}and then she attacked becky
and then she was arrested.

28:06.051 --> 28:07.452
{\an8}Now we got a problem,
bitch!

28:07.519 --> 28:09.154
{\an7}No, no, let's finish
this conversation.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.777
and I can tell that everybody's
feeling my new record

28:32.844 --> 28:35.380

28:35.447 --> 28:37.682
And fingers crossed,

28:37.749 --> 28:40.552
AKA Lil Stupid,
AKA Lil Brandi,

shows up so I can expose her

28:42.520 --> 28:44.956
for the bad bitch
that she is not.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.558
Hey, bitch.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.558
{\an3}Hey, bitch!

28:46.624 --> 28:48.460
Ouch, your contour cut me.

28:48.526 --> 28:49.961
{\an1}Did it?
I'm sorry.

28:50.028 --> 28:51.229
Patch, patch, Band-Aid.

28:51.296 --> 28:52.897
That's okay, I'm fine.
I'm liking this.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.899
{\an7}Thank you.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.899
{\an9}Super cute.

28:54.966 --> 28:59.304
{\an1}Speaking of bad bitches,
are the bad dog crew coming?

28:59.370 --> 29:00.839
{\an1}I don't know.
I invited them.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.440
{\an4}I literally--
You know, I don't--

29:00.905 --> 29:02.440
Oh, you actually did?

29:02.507 --> 29:03.842
{\an1}Yeah, I don't have
phone numbers,

29:03.908 --> 29:06.177
so I decided to DM them.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.946
{\an1}Princess didn't confirm
or deny.

29:08.012 --> 29:10.115
{\an1}I don't know if Brandi saw it,
Princess responded "LOL"

29:10.181 --> 29:11.416
{\an5}and I was just, like...

29:10.181 --> 29:11.416
What's funny?

29:11.483 --> 29:14.319
{\an1}This really isn't
about Princess for me.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.354
{\an1}No, this is about Brandi
and I just sended the invite

29:16.421 --> 29:17.989
{\an1}'cause I know they're close
and I know one

29:18.056 --> 29:20.024
{\an1}would have probably passed it
to the other anyway.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.061
{\an1}I'm just trying to see
how you plan on this going.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.196
{\an1}Well, I don't plan on it
ending very well.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.798
That was never the goal here.

29:26.865 --> 29:27.999
But why would you want
to (bleep) up

29:28.066 --> 29:29.434
your own listening party?

29:29.501 --> 29:30.535
{\an1}Well, you know,
because sometimes,

29:30.602 --> 29:32.637
we have to make sacrifices.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.806
{\an8}Honestly, I don't think
turning this one listening party

29:34.873 --> 29:36.875
{\an8}into a (bleep) show
is that big of a deal.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.109
{\an8}My new record is a smash

29:38.176 --> 29:39.811
{\an8}and it's gonna be a hit
no matter what.

29:39.878 --> 29:41.679
I just pray that the Lord
doesn't smite me down.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.415
{\an5}I, for one, think this
is a terrible idea.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.415
{\an1}It's okay.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.784
{\an3}And I'm in.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.784
{\an1}Yes!

29:46.851 --> 29:48.853
{\an5}This is a bad idea.

29:46.851 --> 29:48.853
This is what bad bitches do.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.421
{\an1}♪ Ha... ♪

29:50.488 --> 29:52.056
♪ ...llelujah ♪

29:57.162 --> 29:58.363
I hear clunking,

29:58.429 --> 30:00.431
I see a mutt and a trainer
and a handler.

30:00.498 --> 30:01.733
Three of them?

30:00.498 --> 30:01.733
Yes.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.935
{\an1}Oh, my God.
Well...

30:04.002 --> 30:08.773
{\an8}Me, my girl Bryanna Da'na,
a true singer,

30:08.840 --> 30:11.009
{\an8}and my girl Princess roll up

30:11.075 --> 30:13.444
like the true bad bitches
that we are.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.980
You don't want to turn
this place out.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.549
{\an5}We will if we have to.

30:16.047 --> 30:17.549
{\an1}Right.

30:17.615 --> 30:21.719
Hello. I would like to take
this moment to thank everybody

30:21.786 --> 30:25.123
for coming and I would also
like to acknowledge

30:25.190 --> 30:29.194
a couple of people.
Princess and Brandi.

30:29.260 --> 30:33.831
We've come a long way.
I also wanted to share the fact

30:33.898 --> 30:36.501
that, Brandi, becky found me

30:36.568 --> 30:38.803
and she was not
serving me lemonade,

30:38.870 --> 30:42.006
she was serving me
piping hot tea.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.075
And the tea...

30:44.142 --> 30:46.344
Brandi went looking
for her husband

30:46.411 --> 30:49.380
and then she attacked becky,
and then she was arrested,

30:49.447 --> 30:51.716
so I've come to the conclusion

30:51.783 --> 30:54.652
that if that were my life,
I'd be unhappy, too.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.721
(Brandi)
The real story with becky is,

30:56.788 --> 30:58.890
it was a very dangerous
situation

30:58.957 --> 31:03.061
and the police had to be called,
but let's be clear here.

31:03.127 --> 31:05.296
It had nothing to do
with my husband.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.600
What really pisses me off
is that that little girl

31:08.666 --> 31:14.572
had the nerves to lie on
my family and myself in public.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.008
{\an5}Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

31:14.639 --> 31:17.008
With all that being said...

31:17.075 --> 31:20.745
{\an5}Thank you all for coming out.

31:17.075 --> 31:20.745
...sit here and talk
about my friend like this.

31:20.812 --> 31:21.980
{\an1}Let's finish
this conversation.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.481
That's the best you could do?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.483
{\an1}(bleep) lie
to make yourself relevant?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.185
You should go on
with that story,

31:27.252 --> 31:28.386
{\an1}with the attention
that you need

31:28.453 --> 31:29.554
{\an1}'cause you're
a mother (bleep) joke.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.389
You know what's not a joke?

31:31.456 --> 31:33.324
The police report
that this woman showed me.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.327
It's 100% actual factual.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.564
Calm down, child, or we might
have to return you to the pound.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.136
{\an1}(Brandi)
Princess...

31:45.203 --> 31:47.505
This bitch gonna quit running
her mouth like that, seriously.

31:47.572 --> 31:50.275
Now we got a problem, bitch!
Now we got a problem.

31:50.341 --> 31:52.944
I knew Moniece wasn't
inviting us to the party

31:53.011 --> 31:54.612
to be on some
grown woman (bleep),

31:54.679 --> 31:56.881
{\an8}but what she's not gonna do
is sit there

31:56.948 --> 31:58.783
{\an8}and try to make
her pathetic life better

31:58.850 --> 32:01.886
{\an8}by tarnishing my friend's life
in front of everybody.

32:01.953 --> 32:04.222
{\an1}You got the story so wrong,
just like your voice.

32:04.289 --> 32:05.657
It's just wrong, baby.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.926
In light of the peanut gallery
having their moment,

32:08.993 --> 32:10.461
thank you all for coming.

32:10.528 --> 32:12.430
Come on, Princess, we don't
have time for this (bleep).

32:12.497 --> 32:14.565
Blessings to you all.

32:14.632 --> 32:16.000
{\an5}(Moniece)
I have no regrets
and I've learned

32:16.067 --> 32:17.769
to live my life
unapologetically.

32:17.835 --> 32:19.370
The Chihuahua
was clearly bothered,

32:19.437 --> 32:21.372
which was my ultimate goal.

32:21.439 --> 32:25.443
Sure, I caused a scene,
but everybody's still here,

32:25.510 --> 32:27.979
listening to my record,
loving my record,

32:28.046 --> 32:29.414
'cause that's
what a bad bitch does.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.016
(bleeps) up on her way
to the top.

32:32.083 --> 32:33.384
Mission accomplished.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.786
{\an6}Oh, my God.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.786
That's all it was.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.455
Quick, easy, to the point,
I said what I had to say,

32:37.522 --> 32:39.290
{\an1}and bitch, it clearly
wasn't a lie,

32:39.357 --> 32:41.326
{\an5}you were obviously affected.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.326
Okay, clearly, you were
telling the truth.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.194
Well, that was a circus

32:43.261 --> 32:45.296
and the clowning
was very entertaining,

32:45.363 --> 32:47.465
but what did you get
out of that, Moniece?

32:47.532 --> 32:49.434
Instead of using this day
to showcase your music,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.437
what you really did
was gave the Chihuahua

32:52.503 --> 32:54.038
a reason to keep barking at you.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.040
This is just gonna keep
escalating and escalating

32:56.107 --> 32:58.276
and guess who's gonna get
drug right down the middle?

32:58.343 --> 32:59.344
Your girl.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.478
I just feel like it's--

33:00.545 --> 33:02.547
This is definitely
not over now.

33:04.215 --> 33:06.584
{\an8}Shanda's made it very clear
she wants her own space,

33:06.651 --> 33:08.986
{\an8}so I guess I gotta give it
to her,

33:09.053 --> 33:11.556
{\an8}so I'm gonna move out and grab
my own space for a minute,

33:11.622 --> 33:13.691
{\an8}and honestly, I really don't
even know what to do.

she wants her own space, so I
guess I gotta give it to her,

33:37.615 --> 33:39.617
so I'm gonna move out and grab
my own space for a minute,

33:39.684 --> 33:41.786
just give her the space
that she says she needs.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.421
Of course, I don't want it.
I hate it.

33:43.488 --> 33:47.492
This is the worst thing, period.
I'm mad at myself.

33:47.558 --> 33:49.260
It's definitely my fault,
and man,

33:49.327 --> 33:51.929
and that's the thing about it,
I can't point the finger.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.264
I did it.

33:53.331 --> 33:54.732
I shouldn't have done it.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.502

34:22.326 --> 34:26.063
{\an8}This is me leaving my family,
this is me leaving my home.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.533
{\an8}This is a whole lot for me
at one time and honestly,

34:50.254 --> 34:52.255
{\an8}Papi, you know me.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.491
{\an8}What?

34:53.558 --> 34:54.792
{\an8}We wasn't together
in Miami?

34:54.859 --> 34:56.527
{\an8}Bitch, you remember
who I am.

35:06.237 --> 35:08.172
Safaree, can you hear us?

35:08.239 --> 35:10.007
{\an8}I hear you, yeah, I hear you.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.642
{\an8}<i>All right, look.</i>

35:11.709 --> 35:13.244
I'm gonna give you
bullet points.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.046
<i>I don't want you</i>
<i>to go word for word.</i>

35:15.112 --> 35:16.514
I want you to feel the vibe

35:16.581 --> 35:17.915
<i>and do it how you do it.</i>

35:17.982 --> 35:19.684
I really like Nikki,
but I'm starting to feel

35:19.750 --> 35:21.652
like she's playing
way too many games.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.755
It's about that time, I need
to find out where we stand,

35:24.822 --> 35:27.425
what the truth is
and just know, what's up?

35:27.492 --> 35:30.127
Where we going with this?
We staying or you done?

35:34.031 --> 35:35.566
What's going on?

35:35.633 --> 35:37.401
You got me (bleep) up.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.370
You got me (bleep) up.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.639
{\an5}(Nikki)
<i>Oh, really?</i>

35:39.437 --> 35:41.639
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:41.706 --> 35:43.841
First off, you don't address me
like that when I'm sitting down.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.077
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you too, okay?

35:46.143 --> 35:48.079
I address you
how I feel to address you.

35:48.145 --> 35:50.448
{\an1}I address you how I feel
like I want to address you.

35:50.515 --> 35:52.517
{\an1}Okay, Safaree, I don't know who
you think you're talking to,

35:52.583 --> 35:54.819
<i>but nobody talks</i>
<i>to me this way.</i>

35:54.886 --> 35:56.153
If somebody
is gonna address me

35:56.220 --> 35:57.221
the way they think
they're gonna address me,

35:57.288 --> 35:58.523
we're not gonna have
a conversation.

35:58.589 --> 36:00.424
I walk in and see you
kissing another (bleep)?

36:00.491 --> 36:02.894
{\an1}But look how I walked in
on you kissing another chick.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.128
Oh, I thought your (bleep)
got (bleep).

36:04.195 --> 36:05.396
I didn't know you got mad.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.231
{\an1}<i>Nah. What's up</i>
<i>with you and Rosa, still?</i>

36:07.298 --> 36:08.633
{\an3}<i>I mean...</i>

36:08.699 --> 36:11.769
we haven't spoken much since
the whole situation happen.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.771
{\an1}She's kinda like,
you're a liar, you're a cheater,

36:13.838 --> 36:16.040
you this and that,
and I'm just like, okay.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.175
{\an1}'Cause at the end of the day,
I don't have to beg nobody

36:18.242 --> 36:19.977
to forgive me,
so if she don't believe me

36:20.044 --> 36:22.246
{\an1}or think it's genuine, then,
you know, what can I do?

36:22.313 --> 36:24.348
{\an1}I would never put you
in no situation like that.

36:24.415 --> 36:25.683
You wouldn't?

36:24.415 --> 36:25.683
{\an1}Nah.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.151
{\an1}I'm never gonna have you
looking crazy

36:27.218 --> 36:29.554
{\an1}if we were really together
and I'm out of town,

36:29.620 --> 36:31.956
{\an1}you ain't gonna hear, oh,
Safaree was out doing this.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.159
{\an1}When it comes to trust
and me being with somebody

36:35.226 --> 36:39.130
{\an1}all the way, like,
I put my all into it.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.298
{\an5}I don't half-ass it.

36:39.196 --> 36:40.298
{\an3}Oh, you do?

36:40.364 --> 36:41.832
Of course I do.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.832
{\an3}Oh, okay.

36:41.899 --> 36:43.100
I'm gonna put my mind,

36:43.167 --> 36:44.669
{\an5}body and my face into it.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.669
<i>I put my mind,</i>

36:44.735 --> 36:47.338
my body, my faith into it.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.639
{\an3}<i>Safaree...</i>

36:48.706 --> 36:49.941
<i>can you be serious</i>
<i>right now?</i>

36:50.007 --> 36:51.576
{\an8}Safaree talking to me
a little bit crazy.

36:51.642 --> 36:53.044
{\an8}He must be feeling himself.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.613
Little does he know,
I got his acquaintance outside,

36:55.680 --> 36:57.148
and she might know
a thing or two

36:57.214 --> 36:59.083
about what he does
when he goes out of town.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.353
{\an4}I just want you to know,
I had a conversation about you.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.353
{\an1}Okay.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.221
To one of my friends.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.221
{\an1}Okay.

37:04.288 --> 37:07.625
{\an4}She wanted to meet you again,
for the second time.

37:04.288 --> 37:07.625
{\an1}Who?

37:07.692 --> 37:09.927
I'm gonna let you
meet her for yourself.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.662
<i>As long as you with it,</i>
<i>I'm with it.</i>

37:11.729 --> 37:12.997
{\an1}<i>As long as you with it,</i>
<i>I'm with it.</i>

37:13.064 --> 37:15.199
{\an5}'Cause I want it all.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.199
'Cause I want it all.

37:15.266 --> 37:16.467
Hey, I'm with it.

37:16.534 --> 37:17.702
{\an1}<i>All right.</i>

37:17.768 --> 37:19.570
<i>Now, what's this, a girl?</i>

37:19.637 --> 37:20.671
Jackpot.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.708
<i>That's it!</i>
<i>You did it!</i>

37:23.774 --> 37:25.276
{\an3}(woman)
Hello.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.612
Do you know my girl
over here?

37:27.678 --> 37:29.347
{\an1}No.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.250
Safaree, you don't know
my girl over here?

37:32.316 --> 37:34.652
Papi, you know me.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.754
What?

37:36.821 --> 37:38.623
<i>Please don't play dumb</i>
<i>right now,</i>

37:38.689 --> 37:40.091
<i>'cause I'm not here</i>
<i>for no bull (bleep).</i>

37:40.157 --> 37:41.459
I don't know
what's going on right now,

37:41.525 --> 37:43.127
but it's not what was supposed
to happen.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.830
I thought Nikki Baby
was about to bring out Rosa

37:45.896 --> 37:48.332
and they was gonna get in
that ooh-wee two times over.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.468
Abort, mother (bleep)!
Abort!

37:50.534 --> 37:52.036
Who the hell is this?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.404
Don't play
those bull (bleep) ass games,

37:53.471 --> 37:54.972
{\an5}'cause I don't have time.

37:53.471 --> 37:54.972
He knows me.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.909
{\an8}So I'm sitting there in front of
Nikki, waiting for my apology,

37:58.976 --> 38:02.346
{\an8}because I'm owed one.
Do I get one? No.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.181
{\an8}She's coming at me,
talking about some girl

38:04.248 --> 38:05.850
{\an8}that I never seen a day
in my life.

38:05.916 --> 38:07.551
You gotta be aggressive
and a G, man,

38:07.618 --> 38:09.920
they putting you in a trick bag,
y'all got me (bleep) up.

38:09.987 --> 38:12.556
{\an1}Who the hell is this?
Y'all got me (bleep) up.

38:12.623 --> 38:16.027
{\an1}I would never, with a 30-foot
pole touch this person.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.695
I have a picture
of you...

38:17.762 --> 38:19.463
{\an1}All right, let me see it.
Where is it at?

38:19.530 --> 38:20.865
Bitch,
here's the picture.

38:20.931 --> 38:22.967
Oh, look,
y'all were together in Miami.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.235
We weren't together
in Miami?

38:24.301 --> 38:25.770
Bitch, you remember
who I am.

38:25.836 --> 38:28.939
{\an1}Boss up,
say she a (bleep) fan.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.341
Oh, a fan on the strip.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.842
{\an5}A fan.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.842
A fan of what, bitch?

38:31.909 --> 38:33.177
Are you
kidding me?

38:33.244 --> 38:35.713
{\an1}A fan on the strip.
That's a public picture outside.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.715
Tell you one thing,
I'm famous.

38:37.782 --> 38:39.684
I take pictures
with a million people.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.720
I don't remember half of 'em,
but this girl right here?

38:42.787 --> 38:45.823
Y'all know my track record
and this don't add up.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.526
My girls, everything round,
butty fat,

38:48.592 --> 38:51.162
stomach flat,
and this girl, like this.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.863
Real talk,
I'm a little disappointed

38:52.930 --> 38:56.000
that Nikki's believing
this random chick over me.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.635
Nikki, God bless you.

38:57.702 --> 38:58.903
{\an5}God bless me, thank you.

38:57.702 --> 38:58.903
You playing games.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.237
{\an5}I'm not playing games,
honey.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.237
{\an1}You too.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.605
{\an4}Have fun.

39:00.304 --> 39:01.605
I didn't tell you
to meet somebody

39:01.672 --> 39:03.374
{\an5}and mess around
with them honey.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.374
Enjoy yourselves.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.675
{\an5}Goodbye, see you later.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.675
You look weird.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.010
{\an5}I would never talk to you.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.010
You look weird, too,

39:06.077 --> 39:07.311
with that tight-ass shirt

39:07.378 --> 39:08.312
{\an5}and them tight-ass pants.

39:07.378 --> 39:08.312
You look outrageous.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.281
Goodbye.
See you later.

39:10.347 --> 39:11.849
The fact that Nikki is here

39:11.916 --> 39:14.819
trying to turn the tables on me
again, I'm at a loss for words.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.521
If and when she comes around,
she has my number,

39:17.588 --> 39:20.791
but until then, I'm gonna
leave this situation alone

39:20.858 --> 39:22.259
and stop listening to Ray.

39:22.326 --> 39:24.361
Damn, bro, what
the (bleep) happened?

39:24.428 --> 39:27.231
{\an1}Bro, she just walked in
with some fan

39:27.298 --> 39:28.666
that I took a picture with.

39:28.733 --> 39:29.834
{\an1}Bro, the most
that girl was getting

39:29.900 --> 39:32.269
was a fist pound on the beach.

39:32.336 --> 39:35.740
She tried to set you up,
she acting like you a weenie.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.441
{\an1}Nikki just tripping.
Whatever happened with her

39:37.508 --> 39:39.443
{\an1}and Rosa,
