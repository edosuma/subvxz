17:09.718 --> 17:11.099
Tell me what happened again?

17:12.617 --> 17:13.791
Or not.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.827
Can we just think about
this for a second?

17:16.725 --> 17:17.553
- Please.

17:19.279 --> 17:21.212
- Is there anything I can
say to change your mind?

17:21.212 --> 17:22.041
- No, there isn't.

17:22.041 --> 17:22.903
Are you coming or not?

17:22.903 --> 17:24.250
- This is just stupid.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.492
Let's just go to the cops.

17:25.492 --> 17:27.805
- I'm taking care
of this myself.

17:27.805 --> 17:29.220
- Well, wait, hold on.

17:30.152 --> 17:31.050
Sasha, wait!

17:34.501 --> 17:36.020
Sasha, will you just
hold on a second?

17:36.020 --> 17:37.608
- Look, when you went
to bed last night,

17:37.608 --> 17:39.023
I remembered the house.

17:39.023 --> 17:41.577
It was this, like, three-story
Victorian-style home.

17:41.577 --> 17:43.096
- Where you were tortured?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.132
- Yeah, I think
so, I don't know.

17:44.132 --> 17:45.409
I was only ever inside.

17:45.409 --> 17:47.066
The only time I ever saw
the outside of the house

17:47.066 --> 17:48.446
was the day that we escaped.

17:49.585 --> 17:51.380
I escaped with two
other girls that day.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.866
We were never kept in the
house in the same rooms,

17:54.866 --> 17:56.661
but we just knew that we
had to get out that day.

17:56.661 --> 17:59.216
We found each other
and we escaped.

18:00.631 --> 18:02.771
- Why didn't you ever
tell me about any of this?

18:04.980 --> 18:06.464
- I couldn't sleep last night.

18:07.603 --> 18:11.124
So I decided to dig a little.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.747
I got really drunk and
built up the courage

18:13.747 --> 18:15.128
to contact these girls.

18:16.785 --> 18:19.891
They received emails
too, just like mine.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.100
So I told them to come with me.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.136
They're gonna meet
me here, hopefully.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.483
If not, we're going,
with or without them.

18:25.483 --> 18:26.760
- Without an exact
address, I mean,

18:26.760 --> 18:28.072
how are we going to
even find this place?

18:28.072 --> 18:29.453
Pasadena's a huge city.

18:29.453 --> 18:30.592
This just sounds stupid to me.

18:30.592 --> 18:31.834
- Are you in or are you out?

18:31.834 --> 18:33.388
Because I'm doing this
with or without you.

18:33.388 --> 18:35.666
- You realize you could
be walking into a trap.

18:35.666 --> 18:36.908
I mean, for all we know,

18:36.908 --> 18:38.393
they're the ones who
posted the videos.

18:38.393 --> 18:39.773
- I saw their videos.

18:40.636 --> 18:42.362
They were victims, just like me.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.020
Come on, all right?

18:49.266 --> 18:50.198
- All right.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.269
Shit, I forgot my cell phone.

18:53.580 --> 18:54.409
Don't leave without me.
- Hurry up.

18:54.409 --> 18:55.237
Okay, hurry up, go!

18:55.237 --> 18:56.549
- Okay?
- Yes!

19:01.761 --> 19:04.419
[ominous music]

19:21.884 --> 19:22.989
Hi.

19:22.989 --> 19:24.370
- Um, are you?

19:24.370 --> 19:25.302
- [Sasha] Sasha.

19:25.302 --> 19:26.544
You must be?

19:26.544 --> 19:27.373
- JJ.

19:27.373 --> 19:28.201
- [Sasha] Right.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.547
- You don't remember me?

19:29.547 --> 19:30.997
- Honestly, I don't
really remember much,

19:30.997 --> 19:34.552
but it's kinda starting
to come back to me now.

19:34.552 --> 19:37.383
I honestly didn't think
anybody was gonna show.

19:37.383 --> 19:38.729
- Well, I'm here.

19:40.282 --> 19:42.215
You certainly look different.

19:42.215 --> 19:44.044
I didn't recognize
you for a second.

19:45.908 --> 19:48.152
- Okay. [chuckles]

19:50.706 --> 19:51.880
So, do you remember how
to get to this house

19:51.880 --> 19:53.399
'cause honestly, I...

19:53.399 --> 19:55.780
All I can remember is, like,
a darkish yellow paint job.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.023
- Yellow?

19:57.023 --> 19:58.611
I thought it was blue.

19:58.611 --> 19:59.405
- Really?

20:04.375 --> 20:05.376
10 years, huh?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.485
I feel like most normal
people would just move on.

20:17.630 --> 20:21.081
- Well, it's gone by
quickly, but it's not gone.

20:21.081 --> 20:22.876
Some things can't
be hidden forever.

20:24.499 --> 20:26.328
How much longer are
we waiting for Norma?

20:26.328 --> 20:27.536
- I don't know.

20:27.536 --> 20:28.434
Give her a couple
more minutes, I guess.

20:28.434 --> 20:29.573
Hopefully, she'll show.

20:30.953 --> 20:33.439
Unless she was the one
behind all this. [chuckles]

20:33.439 --> 20:34.923
- I never thought about that.

20:37.857 --> 20:39.376
- Hi.

20:39.376 --> 20:40.239
- [Norma] Hi.

20:41.170 --> 20:42.655
- I'm JJ, this is Sasha.

20:45.451 --> 20:46.969
[Norma exhales]

20:46.969 --> 20:48.316
- So here we are.

20:49.731 --> 20:51.250
Those videos
surfacing made it feel

20:51.250 --> 20:53.044
like it happened yesterday, huh?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.839
- It's more than
just a flesh wound.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.842
I doubt anything
can make it heal.

20:57.842 --> 21:00.259
- Look, ladies, we
have a long drive.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.398
We should probably get going.

21:02.778 --> 21:05.229
Before we go though, I
have to tell you something.

21:05.229 --> 21:06.541
My friend Michael's
gonna tag along.

21:06.541 --> 21:08.094
I hope that's cool.

21:08.094 --> 21:10.441
He's a really nice guy, he
understands our situation.

21:10.441 --> 21:12.236
- What do you mean, a friend?

21:12.236 --> 21:14.134
I was under the impression
after our conversation

21:14.134 --> 21:15.515
that it was just
gonna be us three.

21:15.515 --> 21:16.620
I don't know if I
feel comfortable

21:16.620 --> 21:18.242
bringing some stranger along.

21:18.242 --> 21:19.726
- You'll understand once
you get to know him.

21:19.726 --> 21:23.420
- No, I don't want some
random person coming in

21:23.420 --> 21:25.387
and learning about my
troubled childhood.

21:25.387 --> 21:26.837
- Look, you guys.

21:26.837 --> 21:28.079
I'm sorry I didn't fucking
tell you sooner, OK?

21:28.079 --> 21:29.288
But you're just gonna
have to deal with it

21:29.288 --> 21:30.772
because Michael
means a lot to me.

21:30.772 --> 21:32.463
Honestly, I wouldn't be
here if it weren't for him.

21:32.463 --> 21:35.259
So fucking deal with it, okay?

21:35.259 --> 21:36.502
- That's not fair,

21:36.502 --> 21:37.917
but it doesn't look like
we can change your mind.

21:44.441 --> 21:45.925
You wanna kill me, don't you?

21:48.410 --> 21:50.999
[Sasha laughs]

21:52.380 --> 21:54.554
- What the fuck is
wrong with you? [laughs]

21:54.554 --> 21:55.624
Oh, my god, this bitch.

21:55.624 --> 21:57.281
JJ, listen to this shit.

21:57.281 --> 21:58.247
- You know what?

21:58.247 --> 21:59.628
You guys go ahead without me.

21:59.628 --> 22:01.975
You don't really
need me anyways.

22:01.975 --> 22:02.838
- What, are you
just gonna walk away

22:02.838 --> 22:04.219
like a little bitch now?

22:04.219 --> 22:05.634
You know, if I do
remember correctly,

22:05.634 --> 22:06.635
you were the one who
reached out to me

22:06.635 --> 22:08.499
when I messaged you and JJ.

22:08.499 --> 22:10.018
You wanna find out
who did this to us

22:10.018 --> 22:11.330
just as much as we do.

22:12.883 --> 22:14.333
You know, Norma,
nothing gets done

22:14.333 --> 22:16.921
sitting by in your own goddamn
shadow your whole life.

22:18.095 --> 22:19.648
Somebody's calling out
to us with those videos.

22:19.648 --> 22:22.237
We're not just gonna sit
back and let it go by again.

22:22.237 --> 22:23.928
We're gonna fucking
find that house,

22:23.928 --> 22:25.344
we're gonna find
those motherfuckers,

22:25.344 --> 22:27.346
and we're gonna end this
fucked up chapter in our lives

22:27.346 --> 22:28.830
once and for all.

22:28.830 --> 22:29.658
Fuck!

22:31.384 --> 22:32.799
- Sasha's right, Norma.

22:34.663 --> 22:36.009
We have to do this together.

22:36.009 --> 22:37.217
We need closure.

22:37.217 --> 22:38.149
- Let's fucking go.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.327
[screaming on cell phone]

22:43.327 --> 22:44.155
- Is that?

22:45.847 --> 22:47.296
Okay, okay, okay.

22:48.781 --> 22:50.299
- I get it.

22:50.299 --> 22:52.543
I'm freaking out,
too, and so is Sasha.

22:54.027 --> 22:57.548
But we have to do
this as a team, okay?

22:58.963 --> 23:00.171
We need to find the
courage amongst ourselves.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.381
If one side fails, we all fail.

23:04.003 --> 23:05.487
I got your back.

23:05.487 --> 23:06.454
So does Sasha.

23:07.627 --> 23:10.009
We're sisters, whether
you like it or not.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.151
Okay?

23:14.151 --> 23:15.359
- Yeah.

23:15.359 --> 23:16.256
- Let's go.

23:49.566 --> 23:52.258
[ominous music]

24:07.894 --> 24:10.552
[ominous music]

24:34.852 --> 24:37.165
- [Sasha] I don't remember
which house it is.

24:37.165 --> 24:38.753
- [Norma] Okay, just keep going.

24:40.306 --> 24:41.238
There, there.

24:41.238 --> 24:42.688
Right there on the right.

24:42.688 --> 24:45.104
No, I mean, yes, it's that one.

24:45.104 --> 24:45.932
- [Sasha] Are you sure?

24:45.932 --> 24:47.071
I thought it was yellow.

24:47.071 --> 24:49.004
- [Norma] No, it's that house.

24:49.004 --> 24:51.041
Park more down so they
don't see the car.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.663
- [Sasha] Okay.

24:52.663 --> 24:53.561
- [Norma] Right there.

24:58.807 --> 25:00.671
- Well, this is unsettling
to say the least.

25:00.671 --> 25:03.743
I mean, are we actually
gonna commit a crime?

25:03.743 --> 25:05.262
Breaking and entering.

25:05.262 --> 25:07.126
- Guys, I'm starting
to get nervous.

25:07.126 --> 25:09.646
- All right, let's just
think of a plan, okay?

25:09.646 --> 25:11.993
We're gonna go in, we're
gonna get the DVDs,

25:11.993 --> 25:13.442
and we're gonna get out of there

25:13.442 --> 25:14.789
before these assholes come home.

25:14.789 --> 25:16.031
- I think it's better if I go in

25:16.031 --> 25:17.343
and you stay out
here for backup.

25:17.343 --> 25:19.034
- No, I think you should
stay our here instead.

25:19.034 --> 25:20.001
- Hey, he's here.

25:20.001 --> 25:21.761
Let him go in.

25:21.761 --> 25:24.799
- Look, I just really wanna
take care of this myself.

25:24.799 --> 25:27.215
- It's much safer if I go.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.665
- Look, I didn't
come all the way here

25:28.665 --> 25:31.081
so that I could just hand off
the job to you, all right?

25:32.220 --> 25:34.429
The cards said it,
the huntress goes in.

25:37.294 --> 25:38.709
- Tough as nails, aren't you?

25:40.124 --> 25:42.195
Fine, but you're not going in

25:42.195 --> 25:44.577
until I tuck one of
these into your clothes.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.440
- What is that?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.477
- It's a wireless
surveillance camera.

25:48.477 --> 25:49.720
- Hey, guys, keep focused.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.239
Someone just came
out of the house.

25:53.275 --> 25:54.518
- [Woman] So you'll drop me off,

25:54.518 --> 25:56.175
but then you'll pick me
up later again, right?

25:56.175 --> 25:57.556
At 11:30, okay?

25:57.556 --> 25:58.936
- [Man] I'll see.

25:58.936 --> 26:02.181
- [Woman] Just pick
me up at 11:30.

26:02.181 --> 26:03.182
[scoffs] You know what?

26:03.182 --> 26:04.563
I'll just walk back.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.633
Can you at least drop me off,

26:05.633 --> 26:07.427
or is that too much to ask?

26:07.427 --> 26:08.946
- Are you sure
this is the house?

26:08.946 --> 26:10.741
I mean, those people don't
really look like the type.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.919
- What does that
even mean, seriously?

26:15.919 --> 26:17.161
Yeah, this is the house!

26:17.161 --> 26:18.749
And we're going in
right now, okay?

26:21.200 --> 26:23.236
Why do you have to
do that right now?

26:23.236 --> 26:24.893
- It's the only thing
that relaxes me.

26:24.893 --> 26:26.792
- Hey, he's been
tremendously helpful,

26:26.792 --> 26:28.587
so don't nag him.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.554
Plus you brought him
here in the first place

26:30.554 --> 26:33.488
knowing how he is so,
in summary, suck it up.

26:33.488 --> 26:36.318
Don't be like that
couple in the car, like,

26:36.318 --> 26:39.080
nagging, nagging, nagging.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.289
- We're just like that couple.

26:41.289 --> 26:42.497
- We're like what?

26:42.497 --> 26:44.016
- Guys, guys.

26:44.016 --> 26:45.604
Ah, think we just got lucky.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.123
Mr. and Mrs. Happy just
left the front door open.

26:49.297 --> 26:51.092
- You didn't even
lock the front door.

26:51.092 --> 26:52.921
You know, with all
these home invasions,

26:52.921 --> 26:54.095
we have to be careful.

26:55.717 --> 26:56.615
- [Man] Yes, dear.

27:02.241 --> 27:03.345
- Guess what, Norma.

27:03.345 --> 27:05.520
They're smarter than they look.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.763
- If something goes
wrong in there,

27:06.763 --> 27:09.835
I blame you and
these stupid gadgets.

27:09.835 --> 27:11.146
- No pressure.

27:11.146 --> 27:12.838
- [laughs] It all
makes sense now.

27:12.838 --> 27:14.598
The only reason
Michael's a pothead

27:14.598 --> 27:16.255
is 'cause it makes you bearable.

27:17.325 --> 27:18.671
- [Sasha] Whatever.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.155
- You know what?

27:20.155 --> 27:21.640
I don't even know why I'm
doing all this stuff for you,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.572

46:03.761 --> 46:04.485
Baby Bear said,

46:07.040 --> 46:09.042
there you are.

46:09.042 --> 46:11.458
[man laughs]

46:12.562 --> 46:14.841
[gasping]

46:14.841 --> 46:16.946
[man grunts]

46:16.946 --> 46:18.465
- [Sasha] Get out.

46:21.295 --> 46:23.470
[yelling]

46:28.164 --> 46:28.993
- Stop it!

46:30.615 --> 46:32.928
[screaming]

46:37.622 --> 46:38.416
- [Man] Hey, Larry.

46:38.416 --> 46:39.762
Did you hear that noise?

46:39.762 --> 46:41.522
I almost called the cops.

46:41.522 --> 46:43.007
You can never be
too careful nowadays

46:43.007 --> 46:44.525
with all these home invasions.

46:44.525 --> 46:47.390
- We've got rats in the walls,
but everything's fine now.

46:52.395 --> 46:55.122
[water dripping]

46:59.713 --> 47:01.957
[screaming]

47:19.181 --> 47:22.322
[Norma sobbing]

47:22.322 --> 47:23.875
- The irresponsible bastard.

47:27.051 --> 47:28.017
What the hell?

47:37.613 --> 47:38.510
Larry?

47:39.995 --> 47:40.892
Hello?

47:44.862 --> 47:45.863
Larry?

47:56.735 --> 47:58.565
What happened?

47:58.565 --> 47:59.531
What's going on?

48:00.429 --> 48:02.362
- Look what I found.

48:02.362 --> 48:03.501
- [Woman] Oh, baby.

48:03.501 --> 48:05.261
We thought we'd lost you again.

48:05.261 --> 48:06.745
Where were you?

48:06.745 --> 48:07.643
- I had to.

48:07.643 --> 48:08.678
They came to rob us.

48:08.678 --> 48:09.645
- They?

48:09.645 --> 48:10.853
- She didn't come alone.

48:11.819 --> 48:13.269
- Oh.

48:13.269 --> 48:15.030
- I've got them in the basement.

48:15.030 --> 48:16.721
- [Woman] What
happened to your hand?

48:16.721 --> 48:17.549
- Oh, it's nothing.

48:17.549 --> 48:18.378
I'll live.

48:19.241 --> 48:20.932
- Let me handle this.

48:20.932 --> 48:23.901
You go along and take care of
that blood before it sets in.

48:23.901 --> 48:26.110
- Mom, please untie me.

48:26.110 --> 48:27.974
- [Norma's Mom] Why did you
bring strangers into our home?

48:27.974 --> 48:29.734
- I didn't want to.

48:29.734 --> 48:31.460
- [Larry] What did you want, eh?

48:33.117 --> 48:35.084
- They wanted the
DVDs from upstairs.

48:35.084 --> 48:36.327
- They came to rob us.

48:36.327 --> 48:37.776
They want mementos.

48:37.776 --> 48:38.708
- No, no, no.

48:38.708 --> 48:39.917
I don't want to rob anybody.

48:39.917 --> 48:40.745
I just want to take
back what's mine.

48:40.745 --> 48:41.573
Please, believe me.

48:41.573 --> 48:42.402
- Believe you?

48:43.472 --> 48:44.438
You're a liar.

48:45.888 --> 48:47.959
We said we're sorry for all
those things in the past,

48:47.959 --> 48:51.652
but you just keep harping over
them like they just happened.

48:51.652 --> 48:53.931
Haven't you punished us enough?

48:53.931 --> 48:55.139
- I had my hands full,

48:55.139 --> 48:57.935
so I couldn't pick you
up like I promised.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.005
Sorry, Rosie, dear.

49:00.109 --> 49:00.903
- I see.

49:02.077 --> 49:03.941
Why don't you go get
that bucket and mop?

49:07.737 --> 49:09.463
- Why don't you have a
cup of tea and relax?

49:09.463 --> 49:11.983
That's a lot to
take in all at once.

49:11.983 --> 49:14.296
We have lavender, your favorite.

49:14.296 --> 49:15.953
- Mom, please don't
leave me alone with him.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.195
Please, I beg you.

49:17.195 --> 49:18.058
- [Larry] Yes, dear.

49:18.058 --> 49:19.301
- No, Mom.

49:19.301 --> 49:20.854
Don't leave me alone
with him, please.

49:23.857 --> 49:26.756
[ominous flourish]

49:31.106 --> 49:33.280
- [Rosie] Come on, you
need a little bit of rest.

50:01.999 --> 50:02.827
- Mama?

50:02.827 --> 50:03.655
- [Rosie] Mm-hmm?

50:06.244 --> 50:07.728
- I got fired yesterday.

50:08.557 --> 50:11.560
[music box playing]

50:12.906 --> 50:14.494
- Why'd you get fired this time?

50:15.909 --> 50:18.774
- I told one of the kids
I'd lock them in the closet

50:18.774 --> 50:20.224
if he kept misbehaving.

50:21.397 --> 50:23.020
They overheard it,
didn't like it.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.884
- They fired you for that?

50:25.884 --> 50:27.990
Don't they know kids
need discipline,

50:27.990 --> 50:30.682
and order, and control?

50:32.339 --> 50:35.722
I knew in my heart it wasn't
a good idea to let you go.

50:35.722 --> 50:36.826
You weren't ready.

50:39.898 --> 50:40.727
- I am ready.

50:43.730 --> 50:44.558
- Honey.

50:46.767 --> 50:50.254
Sweetheart, you'll
never be ready.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.188
- Are you disappointed?

50:55.259 --> 50:58.262
- You're just too fragile to
go out there in the real world.

51:03.474 --> 51:04.716
- You're right.

51:07.305 --> 51:08.651
I'm a loser.

51:10.757 --> 51:12.759
- Even the weakest
of God's creatures

51:14.347 --> 51:16.245
has some ability of some sort.

51:17.936 --> 51:19.559
- [Norma] Then
what's mine, Mama?

51:22.079 --> 51:22.941
- I don't know.

51:24.322 --> 51:26.221
You're gonna have to find
that out for yourself.

51:29.189 --> 51:31.778
[door locking]

51:40.925 --> 51:43.134
I think you really
need to lay down

51:43.134 --> 51:45.964
and your father and I will
figure out a solution.

51:48.553 --> 51:49.382
- No!

51:51.142 --> 51:54.111
[grunting]

51:54.111 --> 51:56.423
Mama!
[clock ticking]

51:56.423 --> 51:59.909
Mama!

51:59.909 --> 52:02.740
[sobbing]

52:02.740 --> 52:04.190
Mom.

52:04.190 --> 52:05.605
Mom, I'm kidding.

52:05.605 --> 52:06.709
I'm kidding.

52:06.709 --> 52:07.538
Mom.

52:08.366 --> 52:09.195
Mama.

52:10.230 --> 52:11.093
Mom.

52:33.805 --> 52:36.291
[tense music]

52:50.995 --> 52:52.721
[punch thuds]
[Norma gasps]

52:52.721 --> 52:54.343
- Hey, surprise.

52:54.343 --> 52:55.896
How you been?

52:55.896 --> 52:57.864
You know, I just thought
maybe I shouldn't die yet

52:57.864 --> 52:59.555
'cause your job
isn't quite done.

52:59.555 --> 53:01.592
- No, I saw you die
right in front of me.

53:01.592 --> 53:03.110
- Oh, you did?

53:03.110 --> 53:05.182
There must be something
wrong with your head.

53:05.182 --> 53:07.598
Maybe you should go
get that looked at.

53:07.598 --> 53:09.876
But you know, it
got me thinking.

53:09.876 --> 53:10.808
There's been something
I haven't liked

53:10.808 --> 53:12.810
about you this whole time.

53:12.810 --> 53:14.329
Now I realize what it is.

53:16.365 --> 53:19.057
[Norma gasping]

53:22.095 --> 53:25.098
You know, you never told
me about your daddy.

53:25.098 --> 53:28.653
Daddy's little
girl, huh? [laughs]

53:33.727 --> 53:34.556
- Help!

53:37.938 --> 53:40.113
[gasping]

53:44.842 --> 53:46.913
[grunts]

53:49.778 --> 53:52.021
[grunting]

53:52.850 --> 53:53.678
- Norma.

53:55.197 --> 53:58.476
Please.

53:58.476 --> 53:59.788
Don't do this.

53:59.788 --> 54:01.065
I'm your father.

54:01.928 --> 54:03.861
[grunts]

54:03.861 --> 54:06.035
[yelling]

54:09.211 --> 54:10.039
- Fuck!

54:26.297 --> 54:27.125
- Father, huh?

54:29.196 --> 54:30.025
You.

54:30.888 --> 54:32.234
You sent us those videos.

54:32.234 --> 54:33.442
- No, no.

54:33.442 --> 54:35.962
- You lead us back here,
you sick little bitch.

54:35.962 --> 54:37.274
No, he's not your father?

54:37.274 --> 54:38.758
No, you didn't
lead us back here?

54:38.758 --> 54:40.242
Which one is it, bitch?

54:40.242 --> 54:41.450
- He is my father.

54:41.450 --> 54:43.590
- Oh, so that cunt is
your mother, am I right?

54:43.590 --> 54:44.557
Am I right?

54:44.557 --> 54:46.110
- Yes, yes.

54:46.110 --> 54:47.318
Don't use that word.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.734
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

54:49.734 --> 54:51.529
You thought you could
just reel us back here

54:51.529 --> 54:52.358
and then fool us?

54:54.463 --> 54:56.810
- No, you don't understand.

54:56.810 --> 54:59.641
I blacked out yesterday
and I got fired.

55:00.780 --> 55:02.989
Please, understand that
job was my only key

55:02.989 --> 55:04.370
of getting out of this place.

55:04.370 --> 55:05.232
Please.

55:06.820 --> 55:09.167
They think I'm nothing.

55:09.167 --> 55:11.446
I am something, goddamn it!

55:14.725 --> 55:18.901
- So fucking what?

55:18.901 --> 55:19.833
- You're a snake.

55:19.833 --> 55:23.043
A devious slithering snake.

55:23.043 --> 55:26.012
You brought us here
just to remind us

55:26.012 --> 55:30.396
of the chunk of our lives
that we had taken from us.

55:30.396 --> 55:31.914
You saw it with your own eyes.

55:31.914 --> 55:35.055
They cataloged everything
like it was fucking CSI.

55:36.816 --> 55:40.475
This next question, you
better answer truthfully.

55:40.475 --> 55:41.924
Why did you bring us here?

55:45.825 --> 55:46.998
- I needed your help.

55:51.831 --> 55:53.695
I needed your help out of here.

55:53.695 --> 55:57.664
- Is that why you ran
away because the calmness

55:57.664 --> 56:00.667
of your mother drinking
tea haunted you?

56:01.806 --> 56:03.636
I'm sorry that she liked
to watch her husband

56:03.636 --> 56:04.878
fuck her daughter.

56:05.741 --> 56:07.260
Boo hoo.

56:07.260 --> 56:09.262
You weren't the only little
girl that it happened to.

56:09.262 --> 56:10.367
- Sasha.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.610
[Larry groaning]

56:12.610 --> 56:14.232
Let's finish what
we came here to do.

56:14.232 --> 56:16.269
The tapes are upstairs.

56:16.269 --> 56:17.097
Destroy them.

56:18.202 --> 56:19.376
Then we'll have our fun.

56:25.796 --> 56:27.936
Okay, here, here look.

56:27.936 --> 56:28.902
Here's yours.

56:28.902 --> 56:29.731
Here's mine.

56:29.731 --> 56:30.559
- I have mine.

56:30.559 --> 56:31.491
- Now what?

56:31.491 --> 56:32.837
- I don't know, we leave?

56:32.837 --> 56:33.666
- What?

56:35.702 --> 56:36.634
- What?

56:36.634 --> 56:37.497
- You think we just leave?

56:38.395 --> 56:39.568
You want to just leave?

56:40.604 --> 56:42.399
He's downstairs.

56:44.262 --> 56:45.919
[gasping]

56:45.919 --> 56:46.989
- Ow, ow, ow.

56:47.921 --> 56:49.060
- Does that hurt?

56:49.060 --> 56:49.889
Does it hurt?

56:49.889 --> 56:50.821
[laughing]

56:50.821 --> 56:52.132
Why are you fucking laughing?

56:52.132 --> 56:52.961
Why?

56:59.450 --> 57:00.313
- Ow, ow.

57:22.646 --> 57:24.751
- [Voice] You're useless.

57:27.996 --> 57:29.687
- Mom, please don't go.

57:29.687 --> 57:30.861
- Enough.

57:30.861 --> 57:31.793
Do you want your
father to come up here

57:31.793 --> 57:33.829
and share a few words with you?

57:33.829 --> 57:34.658
- I'm sorry.

57:34.658 --> 57:35.486
No, please.

57:35.486 --> 57:36.453
Please, don't go.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.384
Don't leave me here, please.

57:37.384 --> 57:38.316
- Enough of your tantrums.

57:38.316 --> 57:39.594
I'm exhausted with this baby.

57:39.594 --> 57:41.078
I don't need a second baby.

57:41.078 --> 57:42.079
I can't take this.

57:42.079 --> 57:42.907
- I can take care of him.

57:42.907 --> 57:44.150
Please, please, please.

57:44.150 --> 57:45.600
- You're not fit to
take care of him.

57:45.600 --> 57:48.188
You should be praying
God to give you guidance.

57:48.188 --> 57:49.120
You're lost.

57:49.120 --> 57:49.914
- You can give me guidance.

57:49.914 --> 57:51.364
- I can't help you.

57:51.364 --> 57:52.192
- Help me.

57:52.192 --> 57:53.021
Mama, please.

57:54.229 --> 57:55.161
- I'm gonna get
your father up here.

57:55.161 --> 57:57.197
I don't have time for this.

57:57.197 --> 57:58.371
I really don't
have time for this.

57:58.371 --> 57:59.752
I'm getting your father.

57:59.752 --> 58:01.719
He'll knock some sense into you.

58:01.719 --> 58:04.550
[Norma screaming]

58:11.591 --> 58:12.903
- Where's the baby?

58:12.903 --> 58:13.731
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

58:13.731 --> 58:15.284
This is a mistake.

58:15.284 --> 58:16.078
I have to go.

58:16.078 --> 58:17.597
I have to leave.

58:17.597 --> 58:19.461
- You've been through a lot,

58:19.461 --> 58:20.704
but that doesn't
give you the right

58:20.704 --> 58:22.222
to pull us through your shit.

58:24.397 --> 58:25.329
- I'm sorry.

58:25.329 --> 58:26.088
I have to go, I have to go.

58:26.088 --> 58:26.917
- Why?

58:26.917 --> 58:28.159
Why do you have to go?

58:28.159 --> 58:30.230
Is there something that
you're not telling us?

58:30.230 --> 58:31.715
You better speak up now, bitch.

58:31.715 --> 58:33.648
You're not gonna outsmart us.

58:33.648 --> 58:35.581
- I suggest you behave.

58:35.581 --> 58:37.099
You've exhausted my patience.

58:39.343 --> 58:41.414
[laughs]

58:52.356 --> 58:53.737
- Where are you going?

58:53.737 --> 58:55.221
- I wasn't done
talking upstairs.

58:55.221 --> 58:57.603
It's rude to walk away in
the middle of a conversation.

58:57.603 --> 58:58.569
Look at this.

58:58.569 --> 58:59.708
Look at this.

59:01.158 --> 59:03.332
I like to cut into things
that still have a pulse.

59:03.332 --> 59:06.888
I'm gonna really enjoy
cutting into you. [chuckles]

59:06.888 --> 59:08.130
- I'm sorry.

59:08.130 --> 59:09.338
I genuinely wanted
your guys' help.

59:09.338 --> 59:10.547
Please.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.927
- I'll get that
ax from upstairs.

59:11.927 --> 59:12.859
- Hmm.

59:12.859 --> 59:14.102
What should we do with him?

59:14.102 --> 59:15.034
- I can do them both
at the same time.

59:15.034 --> 59:16.553
- You gotta stay away from me.

59:16.553 --> 59:18.106
- Don't say another
fucking word.

59:18.106 --> 59:20.384
If you had the guts to cut his
dick off in the first place,

59:20.384 --> 59:22.904
he wouldn't have come after
us, we wouldn't be here.

59:22.904 --> 59:25.941
I'm finishing this
shit once and for all.

59:25.941 --> 59:26.770
- I can't.

59:26.770 --> 59:27.598
No.

59:27.598 --> 59:28.841
Please.

59:28.841 --> 59:30.705
I beg you, I have
to get out of here.

59:41.094 --> 59:42.371
- Do you want brisket

59:45.374 --> 59:46.686
or chuck roast?

59:47.860 --> 59:48.964
- [Larry] Who are
you talking to?

59:48.964 --> 59:50.587
- Shut up.

59:50.587 --> 59:51.553
- Garbage.

59:51.553 --> 59:53.831
It's nothing but rotten garbage.

59:53.831 --> 59:54.660
- Don't listen to him.

59:54.660 --> 59:55.730
He's trying to trick us.

59:55.730 --> 59:57.214
- [Larry] Norma, please.

59:58.146 --> 59:59.250
- What?

59:59.250 --> 1:00:00.597
[Larry grunting]

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:02.150
- [Norma] Don't pay
attention to him.

1:00:02.150 --> 1:00:03.220
Come on.

1:00:03.220 --> 1:00:04.670
- You don't get to talk.

1:00:04.670 --> 1:00:07.604
The jury had a verdict
and you were found guilty.

1:00:07.604 --> 1:00:09.053
- Come on, let's
just get this started

1:00:09.053 --> 1:00:10.261
before I change my mind.

1:00:21.894 --> 1:00:22.722
[Larry yelling]

1:00:22.722 --> 1:00:23.654
Don't, don't.

1:00:23.654 --> 1:00:25.414
- Oh, just hold his head.

1:00:25.414 --> 1:00:28.072
[Larry yelling]

1:00:31.835 --> 1:00:34.285
- Ladies, we gonna get this
show on the road anytime today?

1:00:34.285 --> 1:00:35.493
- No, wait, wait, wait.

1:00:35.493 --> 1:00:36.943
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:00:36.943 --> 1:00:38.186
- What?

1:00:38.186 --> 1:00:39.636
Is this not what
we came here to do?

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:41.465
- Yeah, but he's
still my father.

1:00:41.465 --> 1:00:42.362
- Do you love him?

1:00:44.157 --> 1:00:45.365
You owe him nothing.

1:00:48.403 --> 1:00:49.507
And what about her?

1:00:49.507 --> 1:00:50.957
She do anything to you?

1:00:50.957 --> 1:00:52.303
- Who?

1:00:52.303 --> 1:00:53.201
- Your mother.

1:00:54.961 --> 1:00:55.790
- No.

1:00:56.756 --> 1:00:58.137
She was just jealous.

1:00:59.621 --> 1:01:01.174
- And what about
the baby, Norma?

1:01:10.943 --> 1:01:11.909
- You don't know anything!

1:01:11.909 --> 1:01:16.811
Anything!
[pan thuds]

1:01:17.950 --> 1:01:20.262
- You want to come
help me wash my baby?

1:01:20.262 --> 1:01:21.091
- Can I?

1:01:24.750 --> 1:01:27.925
[ominous piano music]

1:01:31.273 --> 1:01:33.448
- Oh, Mr. Fish is waiting.

1:01:35.174 --> 1:01:36.002
Ready?

1:01:38.142 --> 1:01:38.971
Ooh.

1:01:40.766 --> 1:01:42.319
[water splashing]

1:01:42.319 --> 1:01:43.700
Who's that?

1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:44.528
Mr. Fishy.

1:01:46.185 --> 1:01:47.013
Oh.

1:01:49.188 --> 1:01:50.707
And look at this book.

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:51.846
Oh, a little dog.

1:01:51.846 --> 1:01:53.813
Look at the little dog.

1:01:53.813 --> 1:01:55.159
Oh, come on, sweetie.

1:01:55.159 --> 1:01:56.851
We have to wash up.

1:01:56.851 --> 1:01:57.886
Sit down.

1:01:57.886 --> 1:01:59.957
Such a darling.

1:01:59.957 --> 1:02:02.132
Oh, look at these guys.

1:02:02.132 --> 1:02:03.305
Who are these?

1:02:12.521 --> 1:02:13.350
- Mama?

1:02:14.592 --> 1:02:15.524
Can I try?

1:02:23.498 --> 1:02:26.156
- Just stay here while
I go get a towel.

1:02:28.192 --> 1:02:29.780
I'll be right back.

1:02:35.061 --> 1:02:35.890
Damn it.

1:02:35.890 --> 1:02:38.168
No clean towels again.

1:02:38.168 --> 1:02:39.790
Stay there, stay put.

1:02:39.790 --> 1:02:40.895
I'm gonna go get
some clean towels.

1:02:40.895 --> 1:02:42.344
I'll be right back.

1:02:42.344 --> 1:02:43.345
Watch him carefully.

1:02:50.249 --> 1:02:51.146
- Hi, baby.

1:02:55.530 --> 1:02:58.809
- [Sasha] Don't leave him
here with those animals.

1:02:58.809 --> 1:02:59.672
- Well, I can't.

1:02:59.672 --> 1:03:01.087
This is my baby.

1:03:01.087 --> 1:03:03.055
- [Sasha] You can't
leave him here to suffer.

1:03:03.055 --> 1:03:05.747
- [JJ] You don't have much time.

1:03:11.166 --> 1:03:13.513
Hurry, she'll be right back.

1:03:17.794 --> 1:03:20.797
- [Sasha] Do the
right thing, Norma.

1:03:28.528 --> 1:03:31.428

[muffled chattering]

1:04:06.187 --> 1:04:07.015
- [Norma] Oh, God.

1:04:07.015 --> 1:04:08.361
What did you do?

1:04:09.259 --> 1:04:10.191
- Come on.

1:04:10.191 --> 1:04:11.157
She's coming up the stairs.

1:04:11.157 --> 1:04:12.193
You need to do it now.

1:04:12.193 --> 1:04:13.608
Right now, Norma.

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:17.784
- The kid is suffering.

1:04:20.649 --> 1:04:22.824
[gasping]

1:04:24.619 --> 1:04:27.449
- All right, I brought the...

1:04:27.449 --> 1:04:28.278
No, no!

1:04:29.417 --> 1:04:30.245
No!

1:04:31.212 --> 1:04:32.454

1:04:45.674 --> 1:04:48.160
[tense music]

1:04:55.063 --> 1:04:56.237
What happens to us now?

1:04:58.032 --> 1:04:59.205
- I don't...

1:04:59.205 --> 1:05:00.620
Wait, I still need you.

1:05:00.620 --> 1:05:01.414
- [JJ] What for?

1:05:02.415 --> 1:05:04.210
- I don't know, to chop him up.

1:05:04.210 --> 1:05:05.522
I don't want to kill him.

1:05:05.522 --> 1:05:06.419
- Obviously.

1:05:06.419 --> 1:05:07.248
- And you can go.

1:05:07.248 --> 1:05:08.456
I don't need you.

1:05:09.319 --> 1:05:11.114
- Oh, is that what you think?

1:05:11.114 --> 1:05:12.874
This was my idea
in the first place

1:05:12.874 --> 1:05:14.358
and I'm gonna stay here
till the bitter end

1:05:14.358 --> 1:05:15.601
and do it my way!

1:05:15.601 --> 1:05:16.843
[Larry coughing]

1:05:16.843 --> 1:05:18.017
- He's waking up,
he's waking up.

1:05:18.017 --> 1:05:19.191
What do I do, what do I do?

1:05:19.191 --> 1:05:20.468
- Buy yourself some time.

1:05:21.641 --> 1:05:22.988
But you're ready.

1:05:22.988 --> 1:05:24.679
Don't disappoint me.

- We're back.

1:09:14.564 --> 1:09:15.841
- I thought I got
rid of you guys.

1:09:15.841 --> 1:09:18.154
- You don't like to be
on your meds, remember?

1:09:21.502 --> 1:09:23.918
Ooh, I wouldn't do that.

1:09:23.918 --> 1:09:25.747
- I think you're
due for my baby.

1:09:25.747 --> 1:09:26.990
- Why?

1:09:26.990 --> 1:09:28.992
If anyone deserves
to be here, it's me.

1:09:30.062 --> 1:09:31.719
I mean, I have an actual path.

1:09:31.719 --> 1:09:33.859
I'm not a pathetic
victim like you two.

1:09:34.722 --> 1:09:36.172
- So what if you're pre-med?

1:09:36.172 --> 1:09:37.897
What do you have in your
little lonely apartment

1:09:37.897 --> 1:09:39.140
besides your precious rat traps?

1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:41.315
- Would you shut up,
shut up, shut up,

1:09:41.315 --> 1:09:43.489
shut up, shut up, shut up?

1:09:44.904 --> 1:09:48.356
My god, you guy planned
all this, didn't you?

1:09:48.356 --> 1:09:49.323
- You did.

1:09:49.323 --> 1:09:51.014

1:09:55.018 --> 1:09:57.262
[grunting]

1:10:03.889 --> 1:10:05.235
- [Norma] I brought you here.

1:10:08.273 --> 1:10:09.135
You're not real.

1:10:10.033 --> 1:10:11.586
You're not real!

1:10:11.586 --> 1:10:14.244
[laughing]

1:10:14.244 --> 1:10:15.935
- You need a pair.

1:10:15.935 --> 1:10:17.005
That's why I'm here.

1:10:17.005 --> 1:10:18.283
- That's why we're here.

1:10:18.283 --> 1:10:20.319
To exact revenge on the
people that deserve it,

1:10:20.319 --> 1:10:21.941
not some little lab rats.

1:10:23.426 --> 1:10:24.530
- Mama was right.

1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:28.327
I'm not ready.

1:10:28.327 --> 1:10:30.847
- Or you could just
face the truth.

1:10:30.847 --> 1:10:32.987
You need a personality upgrade

1:10:32.987 --> 1:10:35.369
to a more beautiful,
stronger version.

1:10:35.369 --> 1:10:37.957
- Or a smarter,
confident version.

1:10:37.957 --> 1:10:38.820
You choose.

1:10:41.513 --> 1:10:43.411
- I think not.

Hi.

Nothing bad is going to
happen to you ever again.

- Find anything?

1:11:42.712 --> 1:11:46.819
Found more DVDs with
different names on 'em.

1:11:46.819 --> 1:11:48.787
- We've got a dead
body in the cellar.

Unidentified male,
probably in his 20s.

what's on these.

1:12:48.156 --> 1:12:48.985
- Copy that.

1:12:58.374 --> 1:12:59.375
- I don't want to.

1:13:01.584 --> 1:13:02.999
- [Larry] Take off your top.

1:13:06.761 --> 1:13:08.314
Look into the camera.

1:13:17.772 --> 1:13:18.601
- [Norma] No, Daddy.

1:13:18.601 --> 1:13:19.429
I don't want to.

1:13:25.746 --> 1:13:26.885
- Take your top off.

1:14:41.477 --> 1:14:42.685
- She's alive.

1:14:42.685 --> 1:14:44.341
We need something to
cover her up with.

You all right?

You're all right.
