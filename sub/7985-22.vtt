03:48.361 --> 03:49.763
We're back.
(whoops)

03:51.064 --> 03:53.200
KALANI:
Hi, everybody.
It's so rare

03:53.200 --> 03:56.069
on <i>Dance Moms</i> to
see so many boys on set

03:56.069 --> 03:57.471
with you guys.
I know.
Yeah, it is.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.005
It's amazing.
Do you have
any crushes?

03:59.005 --> 04:00.841
GIRLS: No.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.210
What?! Kendall, you were
so quick to get... Really,

04:03.210 --> 04:04.578
nobody?
No.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.946
Out of everybody,
it'd be Kendall.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.581
No.
Well, what about

04:07.581 --> 04:08.749
Gabe? 'Cause I
hear Gabe's name

04:08.749 --> 04:11.651
being thrown around a lot.
Gabe!
Gabe!

04:11.651 --> 04:13.854
JAI: <i>Gabe!</i>
NIA: <i>He's, like, our best...</i>

04:13.854 --> 04:15.122
he's our best friend.
He's our best friend.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.490
Okay.
That's how

04:16.490 --> 04:19.025
it starts, by the way,
just wanted to...

04:19.025 --> 04:20.460
So,
you girls had

04:20.460 --> 04:21.595
a long break.
Uh, Kendall,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.130
what did you do?
I recorded

04:23.130 --> 04:25.098
an album and a single.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.933
I'm kind of waiting on

04:26.933 --> 04:29.236
Abby's approval
if she's gonna let it release

04:29.236 --> 04:31.838
or if we're gonna
wait a couple more...

04:31.838 --> 04:34.341
Now, is that frustrating or
is it kind of... you anxious?

04:34.341 --> 04:37.043
Well, I mean,
I spent my entire summer

04:37.043 --> 04:39.946
recording the songs,
and it's sometimes frustrating

04:39.946 --> 04:42.082
because, like, I see that
Nia is always

04:42.082 --> 04:44.417
releasing these beautiful songs
and she's singing...

04:44.417 --> 04:46.486
Thank you.
She's performing live.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.421
And Abby was so happy

04:48.421 --> 04:50.257
when we first started.
She's like, "I'm your manager,

04:50.257 --> 04:51.992
I'm gonna help you
release music." And,

04:51.992 --> 04:54.361
you know, it's really annoying
when you have a manager

04:54.361 --> 04:57.164
but they don't
do anything for you,

04:57.164 --> 04:58.331
and they don't
want to release

04:58.331 --> 05:00.100
your music, so...
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

05:00.100 --> 05:01.334
No, I get it.
You have

05:01.334 --> 05:02.702
a great product,
you have a great voice,

05:02.702 --> 05:04.304
people should know about that.
Right, guys?

05:06.173 --> 05:07.707
All right,
so, Nia,

05:07.707 --> 05:09.776
now, you've been doing music
for a while now.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.078
Has Abby been
supportive of that?

05:12.078 --> 05:13.547
Uh, well...

05:13.547 --> 05:15.916
I mean,
last season Abby,

05:15.916 --> 05:18.185
you know, got crazy
and she would

05:18.185 --> 05:21.288
make me cry. We got
in a whole big mess.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.023
But actually,
over the break,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.826
she came to my <i>High Strung</i>
premiere.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.727
Tell us about what that is.
You did a song

05:27.727 --> 05:31.565
for a‐a movie soundtrack?
Yes, for a movie soundtrack.
It's a dance movie.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.668
<i>I wasn't even expecting her</i>
<i>to come, so...</i>
KALANI: <i>Yeah, you never know</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:37.404
<i>what she's gonna do.</i>
NIA: <i>Yeah, you never know,</i>
<i>because I thought that she</i>

05:37.404 --> 05:39.840
didn't want to support me
at all, so that was really weird

05:39.840 --> 05:41.408
that she came to support me.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.376
And after,
she told me "good job."

05:43.376 --> 05:45.045
Wow,
congratulations.
Isn't that amazing?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.646
That's a big one, right? Yeah.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.215
That's, like, a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.317
I know, I know.
Wait, Kalani,

05:50.317 --> 05:52.018
what have you been up to?
Well, I got

05:52.018 --> 05:53.587
my permit, so go me.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.223
JAI: Whoa!
(whooping, cheering)

05:56.223 --> 05:57.891
Also, I did a few events

05:57.891 --> 06:00.227
where I like to teach combos

06:00.227 --> 06:02.429
and it's, like, super fun,
so I've really enjoyed teaching,

06:02.429 --> 06:04.598
recently, too.
So, maybe
looking at

06:04.598 --> 06:06.299
a future famous choreographer?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.500
Yeah.
Oh,

06:07.500 --> 06:10.136
there you go.
(laughs)

06:10.136 --> 06:11.204
All right,
Brynn,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.139
what did you do over your break?

06:13.139 --> 06:16.610
Well, I basically
traveled around the world.
Okay.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.212
On...
Doing what?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.781
With Abby and it was,
like, the master classes

06:21.781 --> 06:23.583
that she does.
Like, her tour.

06:23.583 --> 06:24.951
I went to London.
Oh, wow.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.152
And my
favorite one

06:26.152 --> 06:28.688
was actually Gibraltar, Spain.
Wow.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.156
That was pretty cool.
Did you learn

06:30.156 --> 06:31.157
any Spanish?

06:31.157 --> 06:32.592
<i>Hola.</i>

06:32.592 --> 06:34.794
JAI: So let's switch gears
for a minute.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.329
JoJo actually
couldn't be here today,

06:36.329 --> 06:38.064
but she starred in one of my

06:38.064 --> 06:40.333
favorite moments
from last season.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.334
Let's take a look.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.069
Embrace your...

06:43.069 --> 06:44.738
uniqueness.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.239
(farts)

06:47.607 --> 06:48.608
BRYNN: JoJo.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.879
Oh, JoJo!
Ew.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.081
Oh, my...

06:55.081 --> 06:58.118
Oh, my gosh!
(farts)

06:58.118 --> 07:00.787
JILL: Oh, my God,
what did you eat, child?

07:00.787 --> 07:03.356
I remember that smelled
really bad. I do remember.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.191
JAI:
JoJo literally has no shame

07:05.191 --> 07:06.359
about that.
Does that happen often?

07:06.359 --> 07:08.395
We went to Disneyland
and, like, we were just

07:08.395 --> 07:10.063
walking and I was like...
(sniffs) "Ooh, what's that?"

07:10.063 --> 07:11.932
And she was like, "Oh, you just
walked through my fart."

07:11.932 --> 07:13.300
I was like,
"Thanks."

07:13.300 --> 07:14.567
JAI:
I feel like that's how you know

07:14.567 --> 07:16.369
you guys really are family.
Yeah, we know

07:16.369 --> 07:19.105
exactly who it is, too.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.340
We're really close.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.376
I'm just gonna move on
from that one.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.211
Kendall,

07:25.211 --> 07:26.680
you and I have something
in common:

07:26.680 --> 07:28.315
we both like the same TV show.
What is it?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.216
<i>The Walking Dead!</i>

07:30.216 --> 07:32.953
<i>The Walking Dead‐‐</i>
we're big fans. And, um...
(cheering, applause)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.654
why haven't you done

07:34.654 --> 07:36.589
a <i>Walking Dead</i> dance yet?

07:36.589 --> 07:38.224
Good question.
Abby likes
to pick

07:38.224 --> 07:40.694
all the dances, and since
<i>The Walking Dead</i> is my favorite

07:40.694 --> 07:43.196
show, that's probably why she
didn't want me to do the dance.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.534
But since Abby
is not here, we all

07:47.534 --> 07:50.136
have decided, let's do this.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.605
When the cat's away the mice
will play. All right, I know

07:52.605 --> 07:54.975
you have you have props. I'll
let you get ready backstage.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.443

I can't stand her!

10:26.559 --> 10:27.560
Let's bring out Abby!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.335
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

10:35.335 --> 10:37.270
(cheering and applause)

10:39.339 --> 10:42.108
Welcome back
to <i>Dance Moms: Girl Talk!</i>

10:42.108 --> 10:43.576
The new season
of <i>Dance Moms</i>

10:43.576 --> 10:45.311
starts in just a little while.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.312
But first
we're gonna catch up

10:46.312 --> 10:48.348
with the stars
of <i>Dance Moms,</i>

10:48.348 --> 10:49.716
the elite team.
(cheering and applause)

10:49.716 --> 10:52.952
Now, ladies, on your time here
on the show, you guys

10:52.952 --> 10:55.155
have experienced
the phenomenon that is

10:55.155 --> 10:58.525
the <i>Dance Moms</i> fans.
They have been the best.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.593
(cheering and applause)

11:00.593 --> 11:02.162
Yeah!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.664
They're very passionate.
They get super involved.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.933
You have haters, too, right?
I mean, I call them trolls,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.735
but you guys call them haters.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.003
You know, you always tell
yourself, "Oh, yeah,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.604
"don't listen to those comments.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.541
Don't read 'em" and everything.
But I mean, like, you're human,

11:14.541 --> 11:16.509
and if you read
a comment like that,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.244
you're gonna get upset.
You had a moment

11:18.244 --> 11:20.980
where one that you read
felt negative. So let's take

11:20.980 --> 11:22.982
a look at that, because I know
that got you down.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.218
What happened?

11:30.423 --> 11:31.758
Oh, Nia.
(crying)

11:31.758 --> 11:34.427
You know people
on social media

11:34.427 --> 11:36.262
are cruel.
JILL:
You okay, Nia?

11:36.262 --> 11:39.699
She's fine. Just some
negative stuff on social media.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.000
It happens.
JILL:
You know what? Honey...

11:41.000 --> 11:42.001
(sobbing)
Oh. Oh.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.171
HOLLY:
Haters are gonna hate.
JESSALYNN: Don't let them

11:45.171 --> 11:48.174
make you cry.
JILL: Everybody gets it.
You're not alone.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.776
(murmuring)

11:49.776 --> 11:51.911
I did seven turns.
Just, like, I stepped into it,

11:51.911 --> 11:53.580
and I did one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.848
You were proud of yourself! Yes.
And I post... I know,
I was proud of myself,

11:55.848 --> 11:58.117
so I posted it. And I read
one of the comments,

11:58.117 --> 12:01.621
and it said,
"Oh, that's not even good.

12:01.621 --> 12:03.089
Maddie can do that
in her sleep."

12:03.089 --> 12:04.424
(gasping, murmuring)

12:04.424 --> 12:06.025
JAI:
You know what,
the person who said that,

12:06.025 --> 12:09.295
watch me try. Look.
Ooh, look, I fell out of it!

12:09.295 --> 12:10.563
I can't do it.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.932
Write about me!
Come after me!

12:12.932 --> 12:14.734
There we go. Yeah, look,
I can't... I mean, listen,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.336
I think that people say
whatever they want online,

12:16.336 --> 12:18.938
but the truth is that you have
so much positivity online.

12:18.938 --> 12:22.208
You have...
There is one hater out
of 1,000 supporters.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.210
(cheering and applause)
JAI: So, do you guys
have a sense who

12:24.210 --> 12:26.112
your fan base is?
I mean, is it adults?

12:26.112 --> 12:28.014
Is it teenagers?

12:28.014 --> 12:29.515
There's a whole range.
A lot of teens.

12:29.515 --> 12:30.850
Yeah, a lot of teens.
I think it's
a lot of teens.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.085
But there's
also little... a lot

12:32.085 --> 12:34.320
of little girls.
And there's adults, too.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.521
It's really cool.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.123
So, two of your biggest fans
flew in

12:37.123 --> 12:38.625
to be with you guys here today.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.592
(laughter)
NIA:
No way!

12:39.592 --> 12:40.860
No way!

12:40.860 --> 12:42.595
From Houston, Texas,
and Cleveland, Ohio,

12:42.595 --> 12:45.999
please welcome superfan
number one. This is Libby!

12:45.999 --> 12:48.167
(cheering and applause)

12:48.167 --> 12:50.270
Whoa!

12:50.270 --> 12:52.272
JAI: Libby!
(laughter)

12:55.708 --> 12:59.512
Oh, my...
(laughing)
Hello!

12:59.512 --> 13:01.748

13:01.748 --> 13:04.050
JAI:
All right,
superfan number two,

13:04.050 --> 13:06.452
Nicole!
Where are you, Nicole?!

13:06.452 --> 13:09.255
Give it up

13:09.255 --> 13:10.623
KENDALL:
Thank you so much

13:10.623 --> 13:11.658
for coming!

13:11.658 --> 13:13.092
JAI:
Libby, you're a grandma,

13:13.092 --> 13:14.494
I think, right?
I am.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.828
You know, I'm gonna call you
Grandma Libby, 'cause I feel

13:15.828 --> 13:17.730
like we're all a family here.
Grandma Libby,

13:17.730 --> 13:19.499
what is it about the show
that you love so much?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.733
The girls.
(cheering and applause)

13:20.733 --> 13:22.368
I had my phone,
and it said,

13:22.368 --> 13:23.770
you know, that little message,
"You don't have any...

13:23.770 --> 13:24.937
no more room."

13:24.937 --> 13:27.874
I was deleting all the pictures
of my grandkids...

13:27.874 --> 13:30.643
(laughs)
so that I could take pictures
of them!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.345
(laughter)
And I just want

13:32.345 --> 13:34.314
to tell y'all...

13:34.314 --> 13:35.948
Abby didn't come in yet,
did she?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.717
I can't stand her.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.485
I can't
stand her.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.887
I can't stand her.

13:40.887 --> 13:42.655
And your mothers
are a close second.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.756
(laughter)

13:43.756 --> 13:45.591
KENDALL:
Well, I appreciate you

13:45.591 --> 13:47.660
still watching.
(chuckles)

13:47.660 --> 13:48.494
'Cause I love y'all.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.063
BRYNN: Aww.
Is it weird

13:50.063 --> 13:51.998
to see us in person
than on TV?

13:51.998 --> 13:55.401
Yes! And I just love you!
(laughter)

13:55.401 --> 13:56.836
NICOLE:
They're the reason
I want to grow up

13:56.836 --> 13:58.638
and be a choreographer.
Like, they're so good.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.440
Everything about 'em.
Yeah, you guys are amazing.
Aw, thank you.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.741
Thank you.

14:01.741 --> 14:02.875
NICOLE
Nia always

14:02.875 --> 14:04.043
surprises me.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.612
With the talent you
have, you definitely

14:06.612 --> 14:07.880
don't get what you deserve.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.415
No matter what you place,
you always kill it.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.550
And I just
love it.
Aw.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.118
Thank you so much!
You're welcome.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.920
You're welcome.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.756
(whooping)
JAI:
Let's hustle back

14:16.756 --> 14:18.758
to Grandma Libby. Do you have
a favorite mom moment

14:18.758 --> 14:20.360
from last season?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.828
She doesn't like
the moms.
I know she doesn't like 'em,

14:21.828 --> 14:23.463
but anything memorable
that popped out?

14:23.463 --> 14:26.833
Well, I... It drives me crazy
the way Jill switches

14:26.833 --> 14:29.001
back and forth at...
In season two...

14:29.001 --> 14:32.038
That's when you started,
right? In season two,
Oh, my gosh, season two.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.273
she wore that stupid cowboy hat,

14:34.273 --> 14:36.309
and she
was obnoxious.
(laughter)

14:37.944 --> 14:39.345
She cares about her kids.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.849
She wants the best for Kendall,
and she will do anything.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.450
Literally.
Literally.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.520
Mama bear. Mama bear.
Mama bear.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.655
You don't want
to disturb the mama bear.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.624
(laughter)

14:51.624 --> 14:53.226
Who's your favorite mom?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.495
Or who do you think's
the funniest?
It's not my mom.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.131
Holly's the best. I
talked to her backstage.
(cheering and applause)

14:58.131 --> 15:01.200
My mom fangirl'd
over meeting your mom.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.602
And my mom doesn't fangirl.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.736
(applause)

15:03.736 --> 15:04.871
LIBBY:
Well, I support Holly,

15:04.871 --> 15:07.673
because she
always tells Abby

15:07.673 --> 15:10.977
you cannot talk to the girls
like that.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.111
(laughter)

15:12.111 --> 15:13.780
NICOLE:
Nia,

15:13.780 --> 15:15.882
do you have anything, like,
new coming up with your music?

15:15.882 --> 15:17.083
Yes. I have

15:17.083 --> 15:17.817
a new song.

15:17.817 --> 15:18.985
The song
is called

15:18.985 --> 15:20.720
"Here for You" and it's a ballad

15:20.720 --> 15:23.189
and it's actually about
you guys.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.224
Aw! Thank you.
Because you guys
are my dance family and...

15:25.224 --> 15:26.692
pretty much my sisters.

15:26.692 --> 15:28.094
We laugh, we
cry together,

15:28.094 --> 15:30.096
and we have each other's back
and we're...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.531
We have a good time together.
Right, we're always
gonna be there

15:31.531 --> 15:33.800
for each other, so...
And I like
that you picked

15:33.800 --> 15:36.002
a ballad this time, really
showcasing, you know,

15:36.002 --> 15:39.238
your vocals.
Yeah. I have
a new voice teacher, and...

15:39.238 --> 15:41.541
I feel like I'm ready.
All right.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.609
Would you guys want to hear one
of Nia's new songs?!

15:43.609 --> 15:45.478
(cheering and applause)
What do you say?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.113
Ladies and

It also really builds a lot of
strength in dance,

19:29.869 --> 19:33.005
'cause it teaches you to pick up
choreography really fast.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.409
How fast do you have to learn
numbers to be on this team?

19:36.409 --> 19:37.810
ELLIANA:
Three days.
Three days.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.745
Not really,

19:39.745 --> 19:41.514
because on Wednesdays
we have pyramid,

19:41.514 --> 19:42.982
but then sometimes

19:42.982 --> 19:44.684
if Abby gets
a little bit crazy...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.185
She locks herself
in the bathroom.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.454
JAI:
Why?

19:48.454 --> 19:49.689
The moms just...

19:49.689 --> 19:51.390
talk a lot and I guess,

19:51.390 --> 19:53.125
she's just like, ugh.
AREANA:
Yeah.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.361
(audience exclaiming)

19:55.361 --> 19:58.164
Areana, you are really
good with makeup.

19:58.164 --> 19:59.598
You love makeup.
Yep.

19:59.598 --> 20:00.666
Can you give me some tips?

20:00.666 --> 20:02.268
Some...
Okay.

20:02.268 --> 20:05.204
So today I did my own makeup.
Oh!

20:05.204 --> 20:09.842
And, what I did, was I made
my lips bigger,

20:09.842 --> 20:13.879
because, to me, bigger lips
is the trendy thing.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.648
Wow.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.717
No offense, but you look
like Miranda Sings today.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.684
(Jai laughing)
Thanks.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.820
JAI:
<i>Okay, I'm gonna go to Peyton</i>

20:20.820 --> 20:22.788
at the end there...
Hi, Peyton.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.856
Hi.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.125
So you are the
youngest on the team.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.127
What's that like?

20:28.127 --> 20:30.596
It's really fun being
the youngest on the team,

20:30.596 --> 20:32.598
because, like, when you film,

20:32.598 --> 20:34.166
it's, like, you don't have
to be on film

20:34.166 --> 20:35.835
for the longest.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.203
(laughing)

20:37.203 --> 20:38.304
ELLIANA: And she gets
the most attention.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.605
JAI:
Now, minis,

20:39.605 --> 20:42.074
you finally got a fifth,
uh, team member.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.409
ALL:
Lilli!

20:43.409 --> 20:46.078
Tell us a little
bit about Lilli.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.080
Lilli is really flexible.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.182
AREANA:
She likes to do prank calls.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.718
And she likes to pretend to be
Miranda Sings.

20:52.718 --> 20:53.886
Oh!

20:53.886 --> 20:56.122
Let's meet the newest member

20:56.122 --> 20:57.857

21:19.745 --> 21:21.447
That was great!
Good job.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.748
Thank you.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.583
So you like making prank calls.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.018
What do you do?

21:26.018 --> 21:31.223
I, um, act like, like, uh,
the pizza man or Miranda Sings.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.892
And what do you say
when you do the pizza man?
Yeah.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.160
AREANA:
I'll be the person.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.427
Hello.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.762
(with funny accent):
Hello.

21:36.762 --> 21:39.398
I heard that
you wanted pizza.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.533
No.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.134
You texted me that
you wanted pizza.
No.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.202
Yes, you did.
No, I...
I didn't.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.870
I didn't
order pizza.
Yes, you did.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.938
No.
Don't lie.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.239
(laughing)

21:47.239 --> 21:48.574
Fine. I want pizza.

21:48.574 --> 21:49.809
What kind?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.143
Cheese, please.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.211
Oh, sorry;
we don't have cheese.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.213
(laughing)

21:55.314 --> 21:56.582
JAI:
I know that Kalani,

21:56.582 --> 21:59.218
you've been doing
some choreography for the minis.

21:59.218 --> 22:01.887
Minis, would you say
that Kalani

22:01.887 --> 22:05.057
and Abby's teaching styles
are similar?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.559
MINIS:
No!

22:06.559 --> 22:09.228
Kalani doesn't lock herself
in the bathroom.

22:09.228 --> 22:12.298
(audience laughing)

22:12.298 --> 22:13.432
She's a dancer.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.167
She knows that it takes
a little bit of time

22:15.167 --> 22:17.903
for us to pick up
the choreography,

22:17.903 --> 22:20.339
which, Abby, I feel like
she just wants us

22:20.339 --> 22:21.607
to pick it up right away.

22:21.607 --> 22:22.675
Kalani, you've actually
choreographed

22:22.675 --> 22:24.310
a new number
for the girls.
Yeah.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.145
It's my first group dance
I've ever choreographed,

22:26.145 --> 22:28.614
so thank you, girls,
for being in it.

22:28.614 --> 22:29.815
Yay!

22:29.815 --> 22:31.317
(applause)
KALANI: And...

22:31.317 --> 22:35.387
It's inspired by
an ALDC OG dance, "Electricity".

22:35.387 --> 22:37.823
And I know it was a little bit
of a scandal when you did it.

22:37.823 --> 22:38.924
Oh, my gosh.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.526
Yeah, I know...
I remember my mom

22:40.526 --> 22:42.027
almost pulled me
from the dance.
Oh, my gosh.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.662
JAI:
Why, what happened?
Wait... why?

22:43.662 --> 22:45.231

you, like, fail,

my God, that's amazing!"

You messed up
on Tuesday.

everywhere she goes.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.798
Tiffanie and I have both
had to tell her

26:39.798 --> 26:40.966
to calm down a little bit,

26:40.966 --> 26:42.701
because she tends
to get a little crazy.

She's literally just cartwheeled

when you are a little girl,

26:54.346 --> 26:56.381
we know
that you like to dance

26:56.381 --> 26:58.417

with the music.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.119

I always knew Peyton

27:06.892 --> 27:08.060
was gonna be into accessories

27:08.060 --> 27:09.228
'cause
when she was a little girl,

27:09.228 --> 27:10.762
she was so bald that

27:10.762 --> 27:12.865
every time we'd go to the store
or something,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.000
somebody would think
she was a little boy.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.869
Oh!
So Kerri would buy
these head bands

27:16.869 --> 27:18.770
to go around her head,
and she'd reach

27:18.770 --> 27:20.172
through the crib and grab 'em,

27:20.172 --> 27:22.174
and then she'd put 'em
all on her neck, so,

27:22.174 --> 27:23.342
she needed her accessories then.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.377

27:25.377 --> 27:28.280
Hi. I'm Elliana's father.

might not know about Elliana‐‐

27:32.985 --> 27:35.320
at eight years old,
you know, soon to be nine,

27:35.320 --> 27:38.891
has already become boy crazy,
which is much earlier than

27:38.891 --> 27:41.393
I absolutely want
as her father, and, uh,

27:41.393 --> 27:43.095
the boyfriends will absolutely
being going

27:43.095 --> 27:45.864
through a rigorous
interview process

27:45.864 --> 27:47.399
before they will be
even thinking

27:47.399 --> 27:48.567
about ever going out with her.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.068
Thanks, Dad.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.970
So, obviously, five years
down the road at a minimum.

27:51.970 --> 27:56.041
(laughter)
Hi. My name is Chris,
and I'm Lilliana's dad.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.743
The first, like,
seven months of her life,

27:57.743 --> 27:59.511
she just
wouldn't stop crying, and

27:59.511 --> 28:01.480
we used to come up
with different ways

28:01.480 --> 28:03.549
to try to deal with that
as parents.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.884
And one of 'em, uh, Lilli,
I know you will remember,

28:05.884 --> 28:08.654
is a song
that we used to sing for you.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.622
And I'm gonna sing it
for you now, so...

Both.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.022

28:44.022 --> 28:45.824

Minis, thank

28:51.697 --> 28:53.332

30:20.319 --> 30:21.753
BRYNN:
Yes. He's so into it!

30:21.753 --> 30:24.589
Do you think maybe Dad's got
what it takes to join ALDC?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.558
No.
Um...
(laughter)

30:26.558 --> 30:27.793
Just give us one secret.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.228
Well, I don't know
how much of a secret this is.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.129
Okay.

JAI:
Welcome back to

30:47.779 --> 30:49.314
<i>Dance Moms: Girl Talk.</i>

30:49.314 --> 30:52.150
We're only minutes away from an
all‐new season of <i>Dance Moms</i>

30:52.150 --> 30:53.952
with new team members,

30:53.952 --> 30:55.387
cutthroat moms,

30:55.387 --> 30:58.256
Abby Lee Miller in hot water
as she faces down the Feds,

30:58.256 --> 31:00.826
and more than one mom
has had enough.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.160
You don't want to miss it.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.962
All right, elites,
it's just us again.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.297
We saw the minis' dads,

31:05.297 --> 31:06.832
but we don't know much

31:06.832 --> 31:08.734
about your dads.
What are they like?

31:08.734 --> 31:10.569
Let's start
with you, Brynn.
Well,

31:10.569 --> 31:12.270
it's actually funny,
'cause my dad's a redhead.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.438
What?!
Yeah.

31:13.438 --> 31:14.606
Your dad's a gin...
That's awesome.

31:14.606 --> 31:15.941
He's a ginger.
KALANI:
Where...?

31:15.941 --> 31:17.342
Where did you
get this from?
Oh, your mom.

31:17.342 --> 31:18.977
Oh, wait. You're
brown, aren't you?
Yeah.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.312
Naturally brown?
My hair's brown, but...

31:20.312 --> 31:22.114
A little sun,
and it gets lighter here in L. A.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.281
Duh.
Duh.

31:23.281 --> 31:24.950
Duh.
JAI:
Kendall, what about you?

31:24.950 --> 31:25.951
What's your dad like?
Oh, gosh.

31:25.951 --> 31:29.154
He loves my animals.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.856
And every time I bring
home a new animal

31:30.856 --> 31:33.392
without asking him, he
pretends like he hates them.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.626
What kind of animals
do you have?

31:34.626 --> 31:37.162
Okay, I have
a baby Pomeranian, Lulu,

31:37.162 --> 31:38.864
and then I have my own kitten.

31:38.864 --> 31:40.832
Her name is Rebel.
(audience member whoops)

31:40.832 --> 31:42.300
And... shout out to Rebel.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.202
Anyway, so I brought her
home, and he was like,

31:44.202 --> 31:45.537
"We don't need
another animal."

31:45.537 --> 31:47.239
And I would secretly,
like, see him, like,

31:47.239 --> 31:49.574
"I love you so much."
It's really funny.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.143
(laughter)
JAI:
All right, Nia,

31:51.143 --> 31:52.778
what about your dad?
What's he like?

31:52.778 --> 31:55.113
He is, uh,
like the best dad ever.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.215
(applause and cheering)
He picks me up from dance

31:57.215 --> 31:59.017
every single night
at, like, 10:00.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.486
And usually, if the ice cream
place is still open,

32:01.486 --> 32:03.221
he'll go get me some ice cream.

32:03.221 --> 32:05.323
Yes!
So he's the best.
KALANI: That's nice.

32:05.323 --> 32:07.392
He's the best.
What about you, Kalani?
What's your dad like?

32:07.392 --> 32:09.728
He always tries to show me
what he does for his job,

32:09.728 --> 32:11.630
and I don't even try
at this point anymore,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.932
because it is the most
difficult thing I've ever seen.

32:13.932 --> 32:14.900
What does he do?

32:14.900 --> 32:16.835
I don't know.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.837
(laughter)
JAI:
Well, your dads,

32:18.837 --> 32:20.672
you know,
they've been staying with you

32:20.672 --> 32:22.374
for the week,
so it's no surprise

32:22.374 --> 32:23.642
that they're in town.
KALANI:
Well,

32:23.642 --> 32:24.843
my soon‐to‐be stepdad is here.

32:24.843 --> 32:26.511
Your soon‐to‐be
stepdad. Got it. Okay.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.413
They're actually here right now.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.248
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
So we're gonna bring them out

32:30.248 --> 32:31.483

32:31.483 --> 32:33.418

what do you think?

34:07.178 --> 34:08.914
Do you think maybe
dads got what it take

34:08.914 --> 34:10.615
to join ALDC senior?

34:10.615 --> 34:11.950
No.

(laughter)
Maybe if you
had a couple

How does it feel to be on stage

in the audience watching?

34:23.695 --> 34:24.896
It's actually amazing.

I... I haven't seen
Brynn for a little bit,

34:26.932 --> 34:29.034
so it's amazing to see her
and be up here.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.803
I'm emotional
'cause I'm a father,

34:31.803 --> 34:34.372

I'm a mess, so...

34:34.372 --> 34:35.607

what does Kendall
get from you

34:40.345 --> 34:42.013

34:42.013 --> 34:44.049
Wow, oh, boy.

34:44.049 --> 34:45.383
(laughs)

34:45.383 --> 34:47.686
She gets her great
looks from her mother.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.955
Okay.
Aw.

34:49.955 --> 34:52.424

she gets her sense of humor

34:52.424 --> 34:55.660

Oh, okay.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.230
(audience laughs)

34:59.230 --> 35:00.365
So, Evan, you know,

35:00.365 --> 35:02.300
we know a lot
about Nia already, but...

35:02.300 --> 35:03.702
just give us one secret.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.971
Something that she hasn't shared
with us yet that you know.

35:05.971 --> 35:09.608
All right, well, I don't know
how much of a secret this is...

35:09.608 --> 35:10.408
Okay.
Dad.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.576
(audience laughs)

35:11.576 --> 35:13.979
...but when
she was little...

35:15.180 --> 35:16.381
...I'd go on stage

35:16.381 --> 35:18.083
to say some remarks.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.584
She was always like,
"Can I come?

35:19.584 --> 35:20.719
Can I come?"

35:20.719 --> 35:21.886
She always loved
the microphone.
(laughs)

35:21.886 --> 35:23.254
She never turned it down.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.489
I was hoping for something

35:24.489 --> 35:25.824
a little more embarrassing,
but I'll take it.

35:25.824 --> 35:26.825
(audience laughs)

35:26.825 --> 35:27.959
So, now,

35:27.959 --> 35:30.028
uh, David,
you're Kalani's stepdad.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.529
How long have you known her?

35:31.529 --> 35:32.564
KALANI:
Four years?

35:32.564 --> 35:33.798
About three and a half.
Three years.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.799
Three and
a half years, yeah.
Three and a half.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.867
Well, that's long enough

35:35.867 --> 35:36.968
to get the inside scoop.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.403
I mean, we already know
that you did stay

35:38.403 --> 35:40.171
with Maddie and Mackenzie
for awhile,

35:40.171 --> 35:41.940
and they said that
you're a total slob.

35:41.940 --> 35:44.776
Yeah.
Have you found
that to be true?

35:44.776 --> 35:46.711
No, I'm not
a slob at home.
Um... you know,

35:46.711 --> 35:48.713
her room is a nightmare.

35:48.713 --> 35:49.648
(laughter)

35:49.648 --> 35:51.349
Right now,

35:51.349 --> 35:53.385
it's a nightmare
because all my clothes,

35:53.385 --> 35:55.253
I have to, like,
move them to L. A.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.321
and then I have
to move them back.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.322
I wouldn't even say
it was a nightmare.

35:57.322 --> 35:58.623
You only have, like,
75 bottles of water

35:58.623 --> 35:59.624
there and that's it.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.292
(laughter)
I know you're emotional,

36:01.292 --> 36:02.560
AARON: Yes.
Aaron, but tell us

36:02.560 --> 36:03.995
a little something about Brynn.

36:03.995 --> 36:04.996
Oh, she has an
amazing heart.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.564
She's so fun. Um...

36:06.564 --> 36:09.367
(choking up):
one of my favorite things
to do...

36:09.367 --> 36:10.735
(chuckles)
I'm a mess!

36:10.735 --> 36:11.770
Aw!
Aw!

36:11.770 --> 36:12.771
AARON:
I'm a mess.

36:12.771 --> 36:13.838
I do photography,

36:13.838 --> 36:15.140
and so every
once and awhile,

36:15.140 --> 36:17.542
we'll go do just
photoshoots and it's...

36:17.542 --> 36:18.576
Really?
...it's a blast.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.678
AARON:
<i>I love doing it.</i>

36:19.678 --> 36:20.779
BRYNN: <i>We go to</i>
<i>the Great Salt Lake in Utah.</i>

36:20.779 --> 36:22.180
AARON: <i>It's fun.</i>

36:22.180 --> 36:23.448
BRYNN: <i>And we take</i>
<i>pictures there.</i>
KENDALL: That's so cute.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.582
<i>It's really fun.</i>
<i>I didn't know that.</i>

36:24.582 --> 36:25.750
AARON:
<i>It is; it's a blast.</i>

36:25.750 --> 36:28.219
I don't get to see her
as much as I would love to.

36:28.219 --> 36:29.487
(sniffles)
She's so busy,

36:29.487 --> 36:30.955
but she deserves
everything.

36:30.955 --> 36:32.157
She's a hard worker.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.158
AUDIENCE:
Aw.

36:33.158 --> 36:34.626
I'm just proud of her.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.529
You're gonna
make me cry.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.864
(applause)

36:39.864 --> 36:40.999
Well, this has been amazing.

36:40.999 --> 36:42.534
Dads, thank you guys so much
for joining us.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.035
Give it up for the dads!

36:44.035 --> 36:45.270
(whooping)

36:45.270 --> 36:47.172
(applause and cheering)

36:47.172 --> 36:49.007
We got to go to break,
but when we come back,

36:49.007 --> 36:50.608
we'll see an all new dance
from the girls,

36:50.608 --> 36:51.776
but first...

36:51.776 --> 36:54.312
let's have a
dad dance party!

36:54.312 --> 36:55.513

JAI:
<i>Coming up...</i>

37:12.864 --> 37:14.599
What's been going on
with Abby lately?

37:14.599 --> 37:17.001
One word: karma.
(audience gasps)

37:17.001 --> 37:18.670
Ladies and gentleman, we have
a surprise for the girls.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.805
Let's bring out Abby!
Oh, my God!

37:27.345 --> 37:29.614
♪ Livin' on the dance floor. ♪

37:29.614 --> 37:31.516
(cheering and applause)

37:37.088 --> 37:39.691
All right. Welcome back
to <i>Dance Moms Girl Talk.</i>

37:39.691 --> 37:42.160
Now, we all know that your moms
are very strong personalities,

37:42.160 --> 37:43.628
and sometimes
they say

37:43.628 --> 37:45.130
some pretty memorable things,

37:45.130 --> 37:46.998
so I want to play
a little game with you,

37:46.998 --> 37:48.666
I'm gonna call "Momisms",
all right?

37:48.666 --> 37:50.368
Oh, gosh.
So I'm gonna give you

37:50.368 --> 37:52.470
like a classic mom line,
Okay.

37:52.470 --> 37:53.738
and I'm gonna leave
part of it missing,

37:53.738 --> 37:55.240
and you guys have to fill in
the blanks.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.574
Okay.
All right?
Yeah.

37:56.574 --> 37:57.675
All right, here's the
first one.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.378
I could care less
what you think about me.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.547
KIRA:
This is what I'm talking about.

38:02.547 --> 38:03.448
ASHLEE:
How long do you want
to stay here?

38:03.448 --> 38:06.251
You're a real (bleep).

38:09.220 --> 38:10.855
I think it is
"pathetical person".

38:10.855 --> 38:12.557
JAI:
Let's see if you're right.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.659
You're a real pathetical person.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.928
Yes!

38:16.928 --> 38:18.062
Good job!
JAI:
Good job, good job.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.731
Now, Kalani...

38:19.731 --> 38:23.768
Kira actually got
a lot of Internet slack

38:23.768 --> 38:25.336
for saying "pathetical person".

38:25.336 --> 38:27.038
KALANI:
Do you want to know
what's really annoying?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.039
It actually is a word.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.074
And this happens to me
all the time.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.310
We'll be in a fight,
but she's always right.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.711
(laughter)

38:33.711 --> 38:36.014
Okay, let's see the next one.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.315
Holly, why can't
you just admit

38:37.315 --> 38:39.150
Abby just gave
your kid a solo?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.752
HOLLY:
There's no one else here.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.487
Who should get it,
the empty chair?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.489
(bleep)

38:44.489 --> 38:45.957
BRYNN:
Oh, I know this!

38:45.957 --> 38:48.259
"Empty chair, do a solo."

38:48.259 --> 38:50.161
Is the answer,
"Empty chair, do a solo"?

38:50.161 --> 38:53.131
HOLLY:
Empty chair, do a solo!

38:53.131 --> 38:54.566
(cheering)

38:54.566 --> 38:56.301
BRYNN:
Empty chair, do a solo.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.169
Okay.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.205
This next one's, I think,
gonna be a little tougher.

39:00.205 --> 39:02.173
Let's have a look.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.842
Abby, why'd you call Mackenzie
a smartass?

39:03.842 --> 39:05.710
I'll never call her
anything again.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.612
MELISSA:
She doesn't want to mess
with me right now.

39:07.612 --> 39:08.713
I know (bleep).

39:09.681 --> 39:10.882
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

39:10.882 --> 39:11.749
Kendall.

39:11.749 --> 39:13.718
I know so much about her.

39:13.718 --> 39:15.320
Is that your final answer?

39:15.320 --> 39:16.154
No, no, no, no.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.956
Oh, I... I know what it is.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.824
I have too much on her.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.726
I know so much
about you.

39:21.726 --> 39:22.961
Let's check the clip.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.730
I know so much stuff.

39:25.730 --> 39:26.865
(cheering)

39:26.865 --> 39:29.367
I was close!
So much stuff.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.602
I know so much stuff.

39:30.602 --> 39:31.836
(laughter)

39:31.836 --> 39:33.071
So we're only minutes away

39:33.071 --> 39:35.773
from the new season premiere
of <i>Dance Moms.</i>

39:35.773 --> 39:37.742
Now, girls, what are your hopes
or expectations

39:37.742 --> 39:39.010
for this new season?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.079
I really hope that we get
amazing dances,

39:41.079 --> 39:43.214
and that Abby is really like,
focused on us,

39:43.214 --> 39:44.682
'cause I feel
last season

39:44.682 --> 39:46.651
she wasn't totally,
like,

39:46.651 --> 39:48.820
really in it
for us.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.922
We could win every week,
but we got to have

39:50.922 --> 39:52.423
a dedicated dance teacher, too.

39:52.423 --> 39:53.725
(applause and cheering)

39:53.725 --> 39:55.560
Listen, I'm just gonna
ask you honestly,

39:55.560 --> 39:56.794
because you were there,
I wasn't,

39:56.794 --> 39:58.496
what's been going on
with Abby lately?

39:58.496 --> 40:00.398
This season, she seemed
to be a little,

40:00.398 --> 40:03.167
um, more un‐scattered than
she's ever been before.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.269
She's a mess.
KENDALL: I'm just
gonna say one word.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.070
Karma.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.139
(audience gasps)

40:08.139 --> 40:09.841
She doesn't really have
her life planned out yet.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.409
Like, she doesn't know
what she's gonna do.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.577
Girl, she's 50.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.845
She better have
her life planned out.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.980
(laughter)

40:15.980 --> 40:17.015
All right, ladies and gentleman,

40:17.015 --> 40:18.483
we have a surprise
for the girls.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.151
Let's bring out Abby.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.455
No. I'm kidding.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.456
(girls reacting)

40:25.456 --> 40:26.791
I'm totally kidding.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.127
(girls overlapping reactions)

40:29.127 --> 40:30.962
My heart just sank.

40:30.962 --> 40:33.064
(laughter)

40:33.064 --> 40:34.632
I wish you guys
the very best.
Thank you.

40:34.632 --> 40:36.334
It's always a pleasure
hanging out with you guys.

40:36.334 --> 40:38.269
I think you have done
a great job

40:38.269 --> 40:39.404
of keeping it positive,

40:39.404 --> 40:41.139
and being an
inspiration to a lot

40:41.139 --> 40:42.440
of people out there,
so on behalf of them,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.708
I thank you.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.009
(cheering and applause)

40:45.009 --> 40:48.746
Thank you guys so much
for joining us.

40:48.746 --> 40:51.282
