WEBVTT

00:14.208 --> 00:15.041
[woman] Ready?

00:16.833 --> 00:23.250
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M…

00:25.916 --> 00:26.750
M?

00:32.833 --> 00:37.791
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U…

00:40.958 --> 00:41.833
M-U

00:42.416 --> 00:44.416
E-S-A-R--

00:50.916 --> 00:51.750
Murder.

00:57.708 --> 00:59.375
Someone tried to murder you?

01:01.625 --> 01:03.125
Who tried to murder you?

01:03.208 --> 01:05.666
- [tires screeching]
- [panting]

01:08.458 --> 01:09.791
[doctor, muffled] Mrs. Carter?

01:10.458 --> 01:12.500
[thunder rumbling]

01:12.583 --> 01:14.083
Mrs. Carter?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.833
[thunder crashes]

01:17.916 --> 01:19.916
[doctor continues indistinctly]

01:23.375 --> 01:25.708
Can you open your right eye
for me, Katherine?

01:27.875 --> 01:28.958
Mrs. Carter?

01:34.875 --> 01:35.833
Can you hear me?

01:37.000 --> 01:37.958
Can you hear me?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.208
You've sustained serious head trauma.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.416
- You've been in a coma for three days.
- [machine beeping]

01:47.375 --> 01:50.208
Your brain stem has been damaged.

01:50.291 --> 01:52.458
Brain imaging and EEG are normal,

01:52.541 --> 01:56.500
but I… need some indication
that you can understand me.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.583
- [loud bang]
- [tires screech]

02:00.458 --> 02:01.791
Are you able to blink?

02:02.875 --> 02:03.708
Blink.

02:05.666 --> 02:06.625
Nothing.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.958
[engine revving]

02:09.041 --> 02:11.708
I want you to follow my finger
with your eyes.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.583
Right eye worries me.

02:20.583 --> 02:24.041
Left eye appears incapable
of voluntary movement.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.458
[nurse] Is she even aware?

02:31.416 --> 02:35.041
- [thunder crashes]
- [engine revs]

02:36.375 --> 02:37.416
[machine clicks, hums]

02:37.500 --> 02:40.416
[nurse] Mrs. Carter,
I'm just gonna sit you up.

02:41.791 --> 02:43.333
My name's Nicky Mackenzie.

02:43.416 --> 02:45.666
I work for the hospital,
but don't let that worry you.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.333
I haven't killed anyone yet.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.750
I'm just gonna move your head.

02:54.250 --> 02:57.583
Right. I know that there's damage
to your right eye,

02:57.666 --> 03:00.916
but can you try
and move your left eye for me?

03:04.375 --> 03:05.875
I won't give up if you don't.

03:05.958 --> 03:10.333
Not until you can blink or move your eye

03:11.583 --> 03:13.125
from the left to the right.

03:14.541 --> 03:17.916
I'm going to continue
to assume that there's someone in there.

03:21.166 --> 03:23.416
Well, I'm out of a job
if there isn't. [chuckles]

03:25.791 --> 03:27.791
[man speaking indistinctly over phone]

03:32.166 --> 03:33.000
I know.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.041
I'm waiting. I'll let you know.

03:40.791 --> 03:41.791
[Nicky] Lina Carter.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.791
You don't remember me, do you?

03:49.000 --> 03:49.833
Come on.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.875
[Lina] They said something about, um…

03:54.916 --> 03:56.500
locked-in syndrome.

03:58.291 --> 03:59.125
Right.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.125
It means

04:04.083 --> 04:06.125
a loss of limb function and speech

04:06.750 --> 04:10.625
in what they call
"cognitively intact individuals."

04:10.708 --> 04:12.375
So usually,

04:13.333 --> 04:15.875
if she was conscious,
she'd be able to communicate

04:16.375 --> 04:19.250
with, um, a blink
or a movement of her eye,

04:19.333 --> 04:20.416
but in her case,

04:21.958 --> 04:24.375
the good eye is immovable.

04:25.666 --> 04:26.666
So…

04:26.750 --> 04:28.500
[inhales] Well…

04:28.583 --> 04:30.000
[sighs] It means

04:31.166 --> 04:34.125
she's either in and out of consciousness,

04:34.208 --> 04:37.000
or she can't control her eye,

04:38.333 --> 04:39.166
or…

04:41.458 --> 04:43.125
she's in a vegetative state.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.250
We just don't know yet.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.208
Will she recover?

04:53.208 --> 04:54.375
If she's in there…

04:57.416 --> 04:58.416
I'll find her.

05:02.083 --> 05:04.583
I'm a neuroclinical nurse. It's what I do.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.708
Tell me about her.

05:10.791 --> 05:12.791
[gasps softly]

05:18.291 --> 05:19.958
[Lina] <i>I've known Katherine all my life.</i>

05:22.416 --> 05:25.791
<i>And when Mom died,</i>
<i>she became my legal guardian.</i>

05:27.541 --> 05:29.500
<i>And Rowling Manor became my home.</i>

05:32.833 --> 05:37.750
<i>Back then, Katherine was rich,</i>
<i>glamorous and famous.</i>

05:40.125 --> 05:41.833
<i>I loved everything about her.</i>

05:43.041 --> 05:44.791
<i>And I would've done anything for her.</i>

05:46.333 --> 05:49.541
<i>I suppose all I ever wanted was</i>
<i>for her to love me. </i>[gasps]

05:54.666 --> 05:56.666
<i>But everything</i>
<i>had been turned upside down.</i>

05:58.250 --> 05:59.625
<i>When Katherine's husband died,</i>

05:59.708 --> 06:02.791
<i>he cut her out of his will</i>
<i>and left everything to his son Jamie.</i>

06:03.875 --> 06:04.708
[crowd chattering]

06:04.791 --> 06:06.916
[Lina] <i>And it poisoned their relationship.</i>

06:17.833 --> 06:19.875
<i>I'd just lost my mom,</i>
<i>and I needed a family.</i>

06:19.958 --> 06:21.500
[chattering]

06:21.583 --> 06:24.625
[Lina] <i>If they couldn't be there for</i>
<i>each other, I'd be there for both of them.</i>

06:30.166 --> 06:31.583
<i>I couldn't save my mom,</i>

06:33.458 --> 06:35.625
<i>so I was damn well</i>
<i>gonna try and save them.</i>

06:36.416 --> 06:39.666
- [dog barking]
- [horse chuffing]

06:39.750 --> 06:42.541
[crowd continues chattering, laughing]

06:44.666 --> 06:46.375
- Hold on.
- [Lina grunts]

06:48.875 --> 06:50.083
[horse whinnies]

06:52.000 --> 06:54.041
[playing slow-tempo tune]

07:16.083 --> 07:17.750
[children laughing]

07:21.583 --> 07:23.583
[laughing]

07:24.416 --> 07:25.250
[Lina] Jamie!

07:25.791 --> 07:27.125
Katherine, help!

07:28.375 --> 07:31.291
- Aren't we supposed to grab his tongue?
- Not unless you wanna lose a finger.

07:31.375 --> 07:33.500
- What if he chokes?
- Turn him on his side.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.250
Put it under his head. Here.

07:35.333 --> 07:38.708
- [grunting]
- [Lina] Should we call Dr. Lawrence?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.125
- What do we do?
- [Katherine] We keep an eye on him.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.541
If it lasts more than five minutes,
we'll call an ambulance.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.125
[Lina] He's not breathing.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.416
He'll start again in a minute.
Check his airway isn't blocked.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.166
[operator] <i>Emergency services.</i>
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

07:54.791 --> 07:56.125
[Katherine sighs] He's breathing.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.083
False alarm.

07:57.791 --> 07:58.791
[phone beeps]

08:01.125 --> 08:02.083
Are you all right?

08:30.958 --> 08:32.750
First night out in two years.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.833
You look so beautiful.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.708
Where are you going?

08:39.666 --> 08:41.041
I'm meeting a director.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.166
My mobile number's on the fridge.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.958
Call me if you need me,
but, uh, don't call.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.916
We'll be fine.
Jamie's feeling better today,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
and he's never seen your show.
I'm gonna make him watch season one.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.000
He milks them, my stepson, the seizures.

08:58.833 --> 08:59.750
Then he brings them on

08:59.833 --> 09:03.166
to punish me the moment I try
to live any sort of life for myself.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.875
Maybe he just misses his dad.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.583
It's hard when someone you love dies.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.958
I should know. [exhales]

09:19.333 --> 09:20.833
You're a good girl, Lina.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.833
Your mom was lucky to have you.

09:32.916 --> 09:35.583
- [exhales] How do I look?
- Amazing.

09:35.666 --> 09:37.750
- Ready for my big comeback?
- Definitely.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.541
Ugh. Mutton dressed as lamb. [scoffs]

09:52.375 --> 09:55.375
- [man shouts on screen]
- [dramatic music playing]

09:56.958 --> 09:58.000
[girl] <i>Mommy?</i>

09:59.833 --> 10:00.958
[Katherine] <i>What's wrong?</i>

10:02.291 --> 10:03.666
<i>I'm scared.</i>

10:04.708 --> 10:08.375
<i>Oh. You're a very brave girl,</i>

10:09.375 --> 10:11.666
<i>and we're gonna</i>
<i>get through this together, okay?</i>

10:16.416 --> 10:17.583
I heard what happened.

10:20.333 --> 10:21.416
To your mom.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.375
You're safe here.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.208
With me.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.750
- You'll protect me, will you?
- [exhales]

10:29.333 --> 10:30.166
Promise?

10:30.250 --> 10:31.583
[chuckles] I promise.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.833
What was she like?

10:37.541 --> 10:38.375
My mom?

10:39.208 --> 10:40.291
She was brilliant.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.000
She played the piano.

10:43.833 --> 10:46.458
- Well, sort of.
- [chuckles]

10:46.958 --> 10:50.333
She taught me the basics, anyway.
I can teach you if you like.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.000
I don't remember my real mom.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.291
I remember my dad.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.541
Sometimes his face
gets a bit fuzzy though.

11:12.583 --> 11:14.750
Like I'm starting to forget him too.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.333
Katherine got rid of the photos.

11:20.583 --> 11:21.833
Most of them, anyway.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.333
It's hard.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.083
Losing someone.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.500
Anyway, we've got each other now.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.125
- [dramatic music playing]
- [vocalizing]

11:53.791 --> 11:55.791
[gasping]

11:58.291 --> 11:59.208
Katherine.

12:09.083 --> 12:09.916
[exhales]

12:20.166 --> 12:22.166
[machines beeping]

12:25.625 --> 12:27.583
[Nicky] You know, it takes an act of faith

12:28.125 --> 12:31.000
to say to yourself,
"She's still the same underneath."

12:32.833 --> 12:37.625
The police say that, um,
she was knocked down by a driver.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.333
Is that right? A hit-and-run?

12:40.500 --> 12:41.500
They're not sure.

12:43.041 --> 12:43.875
Right.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.583
Hmm. Will you help me out with something?

12:47.666 --> 12:50.250
I… I just can't wrap me head around it.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.666
[inhales] Um,

12:51.750 --> 12:54.666
Katherine's your adopted mother,

12:54.750 --> 12:57.750
but she's also your mother-in-law.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.000
It's complicated.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.333
Oh. Well, I like complicated.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.166
I couldn't abandon him.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.833
<i>By the time we were married,</i>

13:11.916 --> 13:14.458
<i>Jamie depended on me</i>
<i>for absolutely everything.</i>

13:14.541 --> 13:15.708
[classical music playing]

13:15.791 --> 13:18.958
<i>He needed me.</i>
<i>And to be honest, I needed him too.</i>

13:20.583 --> 13:23.291
<i>I'd looked after him for so long,</i>
<i>he'd become my whole life.</i>

13:23.375 --> 13:24.958
- She's had too many.
- [laughing]

13:25.041 --> 13:26.916
[Lina] <i>I was Jamie's reason for living.</i>

13:27.708 --> 13:29.708
<i>- And I told myself he was mine.</i>
<i>- </i>[Katherine exhales]

13:31.875 --> 13:34.541
[Lina] <i>But Katherine thought</i>
<i>I was a treacherous gold digger.</i>

13:36.208 --> 13:38.166
<i>- She thought I was stealing her home.</i>
- [mutters]

13:39.083 --> 13:41.291
[Lina] <i>When all I was trying to do</i>
<i>was make us a family.</i>

13:41.375 --> 13:43.500
[glass clanking]

13:43.583 --> 13:45.708
[sniffles] Lina.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.541
My beloved daughter-in-law.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.250
Which I did not see coming. [laughing]

13:55.208 --> 13:59.083
[exhales] Who'd have thought
that when you turned up here…

13:59.166 --> 14:01.416
[sniffles] …a helpless waif and stray,

14:02.125 --> 14:04.708
completely dependent on my kindness, that…

14:06.666 --> 14:07.750
that you'd end up…

14:09.833 --> 14:13.041
[laughing] …lady of the bloody manor.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.333
To Jamie and Lina. [sniffles]

14:21.791 --> 14:23.333
[all] To Jamie and Lina.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.291
[slurps]

14:35.375 --> 14:37.416
- [dance music playing]
- [chattering, laughing]

14:39.750 --> 14:40.875
[man laughs]

14:48.375 --> 14:49.208
Look at her.

14:50.666 --> 14:52.625
- Showing off.
- She's not.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.625
[Jamie] She is.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.750
She was nice to you before we got engaged.
Suddenly, starts treating you like shit.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.750
- What does that tell you, hmm?
- Jamie.

15:01.833 --> 15:04.791
This house, that's all she cares about.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.333
Not us. Definitely not me.

15:08.416 --> 15:11.166
Will you stop it?
This is our wedding night.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.958
Exactly. Anyone would think
it's all about her.

15:15.541 --> 15:18.833
Fucking Hollywood has-been
plays lady of the manor.

15:22.083 --> 15:25.291
- I'll spoil her fun.
- Jamie, don't you dare.

15:25.375 --> 15:27.416
- [Jamie grunting]
- Please! [exclaims]

15:27.500 --> 15:29.791
- [crowd gasps]
- [Lina grunts]

15:33.166 --> 15:34.500
[man] Clear the floor.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.458
- [woman] Stand back. Give him some space.
- [man] Somebody help.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.958
- Excuse me.
- [man 2] I presume she knows.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.125
[woman 2 gasps] Oh, my God, what happened?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
[dance music continues, muffled]

15:58.833 --> 16:00.291
[Dr. Lawrence] Seizures aside, Jamie,

16:00.375 --> 16:02.333
we've got to get you off
of these pain meds.

16:02.416 --> 16:06.333
- You're the one who gave them to me.
- With the strict proviso not to drink.

16:06.416 --> 16:08.000
I keep telling him.

16:08.083 --> 16:11.791
It's my wedding day.
Anyway, I pay you to write prescriptions.

16:12.541 --> 16:16.166
You're a village GP.
You're not some Harley Street specialist.

16:16.916 --> 16:19.583
- You've got ideas above your station.
- [sighs]

16:19.666 --> 16:22.208
[Jamie] She's bad enough.
She watches me like a bloody hawk.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.041
I take them as prescribed.

16:25.958 --> 16:27.000
Mostly.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.625
I'm in pain.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.750
- Neither of you know what it's like.
- [Lina] We understand, Jamie.

16:32.833 --> 16:36.208
Right. I will come
and see you tomorrow morning.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.583
Yeah, yeah, fine.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.625
[exhales] I'm so sorry this has happened,
tonight of all nights, Lina.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.083
If there's anything I can do,
anything at all,

16:50.166 --> 16:51.750
please don't hesitate to ask.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.458
Thank you.

17:30.958 --> 17:32.916
[Dr. Lawrence] I'm just
looking out for you, Lina.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.083
[huffs]

17:48.125 --> 17:50.000
[Nicky] I'm just gonna lie you back.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.625
There we are.

17:52.791 --> 17:54.208
I'm going to do your hands now.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.500
Just gonna go in between your fingers.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.458
- Here.
- Me?

18:07.375 --> 18:09.625
[Nicky] Mm-hmm. Come on.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.291
Well, you're gonna have to
learn how to do it at some point.

18:21.416 --> 18:23.208
Do you wanna get her shoulder?

18:25.458 --> 18:26.291
Go on.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.541
Oh, here. Hands.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.000
There.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.125
Just take that down.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.958
Just careful around the ECG spot.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.583
Up round the neck.

18:58.666 --> 18:59.583
[blubbers]

19:02.250 --> 19:03.125
[gasps]

19:04.958 --> 19:07.625
[Nicky] It's an unlucky lot, your lot.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.541
First Jamie, now…

19:12.125 --> 19:12.958
now Katherine.

19:15.666 --> 19:16.500
Jamie.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.541
I used to look after him.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.833
Do you not remember me?

19:24.125 --> 19:25.916
What's Jamie got to do with anything?

19:26.000 --> 19:26.833
I don't know.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.000
You tell me, love.

19:32.666 --> 19:34.208
[Lina] <i>Jamie was always ill.</i>

19:35.583 --> 19:37.208
<i>First, it was the seizures.</i>

19:38.125 --> 19:39.041
<i>- Then…</i>
<i>- </i>[Jamie] Lina!

19:39.125 --> 19:40.166
[Lina] Coming!

19:40.250 --> 19:41.250
<i>…lots of things.</i>

19:41.333 --> 19:43.333
- [Jamie] Where are you?
- Your Royal fucking Highness…

19:43.416 --> 19:46.041
<i>- So he never left the house.</i>
- [Jamie] Lina, come on!

19:46.583 --> 19:48.083
[Lina] <i>And neither did I.</i>

19:48.166 --> 19:49.041
Oh!

19:51.083 --> 19:52.041
- Oh.
- Sorry.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.125
No, my fault.

19:54.791 --> 19:56.166
[both chuckle] Oh!

19:57.375 --> 19:58.666
[Katherine mutters]

19:58.750 --> 19:59.750
All right. [sighs]

19:59.833 --> 20:00.750
Uh…

20:03.041 --> 20:04.625
- What's that?
- Nothing.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.583
[sighs] Here you go.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.041
No rest for the wicked. [exhales]

20:24.666 --> 20:27.208
- [exhales]
- You've got to get off these pain meds.

20:27.291 --> 20:28.458
Don't start.

20:29.041 --> 20:30.333
[sighs]

20:30.833 --> 20:33.625
- [groans] It's dripping.
- Don't be such a baby.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.166
I'm soaking wet now.

20:37.291 --> 20:39.375
- [grunts]
- It'll cool the inflammation.

20:40.875 --> 20:41.958
[Jamie sighs]

20:43.416 --> 20:44.458
Mm.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.166
Nice?

20:46.750 --> 20:48.083
[sighs] Yeah.

20:48.958 --> 20:49.958
Yeah, thank you.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.250
We should get married again.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.041
[exhales] It was
the happiest day of my life.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.083
Passing out?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.791
Dr. Lawrence had
to carry you up the stairs.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.208
[groans] Him again.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.958
Don't ever leave me.

21:17.791 --> 21:18.916
Say that you won't.

21:21.625 --> 21:22.458
[sniffles]

21:26.083 --> 21:28.500
It's not safe out there, Lina,
beyond these walls.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.833
- [pills rattle]
- You of all people know that.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.333
I'm only going for a swim.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.291
It's cold out there.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.250
- [pills rattle]
- On the streets.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.916
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

21:52.166 --> 21:54.375
[Dr. Lawrence] Good morning.
How's his nibs?

21:56.250 --> 21:57.833
The pills are making him worse.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.333
I've got some steroids we can try.

22:03.416 --> 22:04.416
If they reduce the pain,

22:04.500 --> 22:07.416
then we can wean
him off the Oxy, gradually.

22:08.666 --> 22:12.208
But in the meantime,
I don't want you wearing yourself out,

22:12.291 --> 22:13.791
waiting on him hand and foot.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.208
You're ten years too late.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.125
Yeah.

22:18.916 --> 22:20.333
Win the lottery, did you?

22:21.750 --> 22:23.958
Oh, you mean these?
No, they're just good fakes.

22:25.250 --> 22:26.708
I mean the car. [chuckles]

22:27.291 --> 22:29.250
The car, yes. [laughs]

22:29.916 --> 22:33.791
What do you reckon?
Nice, huh? Splashed out on a loan.

22:36.541 --> 22:37.583
You off for a swim?

22:38.583 --> 22:40.791
If I can make it
without the bloody bell ringing.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.125
It must be freezing in there.

22:43.208 --> 22:44.916
I jump in
before I can get second thoughts.

22:46.416 --> 22:47.250
Do you?

23:02.125 --> 23:04.708
What's the difference
between a good joke and a bad joke?

23:06.125 --> 23:06.958
I don't know.

23:09.458 --> 23:10.541
Timing.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.583
[both laugh]

23:13.666 --> 23:15.958
- That's awful.
- [Dr. Lawrence] It's absolutely terrible.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.625
But you laughed, and that means
you definitely need to get out more.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.666
Where would I go? [gasps]

23:27.041 --> 23:28.000
Oh, Lina.

23:29.666 --> 23:31.375
There's a whole world out there.

23:32.083 --> 23:34.000
You can't hide out here forever.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.750
Can't I? [inhales]

23:53.625 --> 23:56.833
[classical music playing]

24:23.916 --> 24:25.041
[bell tolling]

24:29.208 --> 24:31.208
[tolling continues]

24:39.750 --> 24:41.750
[tolling continues]

24:51.625 --> 24:52.458
[Lina] Jamie!

24:55.000 --> 24:57.208
- [Katherine] What's happening?
- Call an ambulance.

24:58.625 --> 24:59.458
Now!

25:06.958 --> 25:07.916
[machines beeping]

25:30.875 --> 25:32.291
How's our patient today?

25:32.375 --> 25:35.000
- Oh, uh, he seems to be doing much better.
- [Nicky] Hmm?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.625
I'm sorry, you are…?

25:38.208 --> 25:40.333
[clicks tongue]
Yes, uh, Dr. Robert Lawrence.

25:40.416 --> 25:42.791
Oh. [exhales]

25:43.583 --> 25:47.291
I, um, I don't… don't know
a doctor here with that name.

25:47.375 --> 25:50.166
- Well, I'm his GP.
- Oh!

25:50.250 --> 25:51.541
What are you doing here?

25:51.625 --> 25:54.000
[Robert] I'm also a close family friend.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.250
Oh, okay.

25:56.500 --> 26:00.791
You're not the one who prescribed him
the painkillers, are you?

26:02.916 --> 26:04.333
I'm sorry. You are?

26:04.416 --> 26:08.333
I'm Nurse Mackenzie. I'm neuroclinical.

26:09.666 --> 26:12.541
I mean, I deal with anyone who comes
in here with neurological problems,

26:12.625 --> 26:14.416
including grand mal seizures.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.958
Right. So you'll know
that there are no contraindications

26:17.041 --> 26:19.291
between his pain meds
and his seizure medication.

26:19.375 --> 26:23.375
And you'll know that 80 milligrams
of codeine is hardly a responsible dosage

26:23.458 --> 26:25.250
to give to someone who appears

26:26.416 --> 26:29.041
to have problems with painkillers.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.375
[Robert clicks tongue] I think we should
give the family some peace and quiet.

26:36.083 --> 26:36.958
[Nicky] Hmm?

26:39.083 --> 26:41.708
[scoffs] All right.

26:41.791 --> 26:43.083
[Robert] Be right back.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.916
I don't appreciate people casting
professional aspersions on me.

26:49.000 --> 26:49.916
No, I was just--

26:50.000 --> 26:52.500
Especially in front of a patient
and his family,

26:53.625 --> 26:55.666
by someone who barely knows
the young man in question,

26:55.750 --> 26:57.708
and is, in any case,
completely unqualified

26:57.791 --> 27:00.916
to make judgments about
the patient's reliance on pain medication.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.541
I'm his GP. You're a nurse.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.375
Show some respect.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.458
Mr. Carter

27:10.083 --> 27:11.375
is under my care now.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.625
[Robert] Sorry about that.

27:36.791 --> 27:38.708
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.458
[clears throat] Lina.

27:45.541 --> 27:47.125
- I'm interrupting.
- [Robert] No, no. Um…

27:47.208 --> 27:50.125
[clears throat] Excuse me.
Not at all. Please come in.

27:52.208 --> 27:55.208
He must have rung the bell
right before it happened.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.583
[inhales] I think he did it to punish me.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.166
[sobs]

28:07.250 --> 28:09.416
[inhales] I don't know which is worse.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.416
Spending the rest of my life trying

28:12.500 --> 28:14.666
to fix someone
that doesn't wanna be fixed…

28:17.166 --> 28:18.375
[exhales]

28:18.458 --> 28:19.958
[gasps] …or admitting that…

28:22.791 --> 28:25.333
[inhales] …without him,
my life would be empty.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.000
Caring for someone like Jamie
can be stressful.

28:35.416 --> 28:36.958
It's none of my business.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.541
But when was the last time
you had any fun?

28:44.625 --> 28:45.708
[scoffs]

28:46.416 --> 28:47.250
[laughs]

28:49.916 --> 28:50.916
Can't remember.

28:51.500 --> 28:52.333
Well…

28:54.833 --> 28:55.708
personally…

28:57.958 --> 28:59.541
I'd recommend a holiday.

29:00.583 --> 29:01.625
Somewhere hot.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.083
Let your hair down.

29:05.666 --> 29:07.750
Drink till you fall over.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.666
Dance a lot.

29:10.375 --> 29:13.750
Preferably the samba or the rumba.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.666
- Or possibly the mumba.
- [chuckles]

29:16.625 --> 29:18.458
- The mumba?
- [laughs]

29:23.833 --> 29:24.708
With who?

29:28.958 --> 29:29.791
A friend.

29:37.041 --> 29:38.041
Doctor's orders.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.458
Stand up to them, Lina.

30:08.041 --> 30:09.166
[Robert exhales]

30:10.625 --> 30:11.666
[exhales]

30:14.500 --> 30:15.416
[Lina gasps]

30:16.458 --> 30:18.458
[panting]

30:22.541 --> 30:24.875
[respirator hissing]

30:57.375 --> 30:59.750
[panting]

30:59.833 --> 31:01.291
- [thudding]
- Fuck!

31:03.500 --> 31:04.625
[Robert] You all right?

31:05.208 --> 31:06.083
Cut my foot.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.541
Oh, well, hop in. I'll take you back
to the house and have a look at it.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.791
No, thanks.

31:12.416 --> 31:13.791
[laughs] Don't be silly.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.666
Let me help you. Look at you.
You're hobbling, and you're gonna ruin…

31:17.750 --> 31:19.750
[continues indistinct]

31:23.333 --> 31:24.375
[horse chuffing]

31:31.250 --> 31:32.208
[Katherine] Lina.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.208
I'm okay. It's just a cut.
Looks worse than it is.

31:36.500 --> 31:39.541
[exhales] You must think
I'm a bloody fool.

31:40.916 --> 31:41.916
Sorry?

31:42.750 --> 31:43.583
Come here.

31:49.625 --> 31:50.791
[winces]

31:51.708 --> 31:55.041
Katherine… is there something wrong?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.666
When I took you in, you had nothing.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.791
Now I'm practically a lodger
in my own home,

32:00.875 --> 32:02.583
which isn't even mine anymore.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.708
I sunk everything I had into Rowling
and for what, hmm?

32:06.791 --> 32:08.416
You've had a life for the last ten years

32:08.500 --> 32:10.583
because I took over
and looked after Jamie.

32:11.458 --> 32:12.625
I'm not his wife.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.041
I'm his mother.

32:16.708 --> 32:19.125
His nurse, his carer.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.875
Different words for the same thing.

32:23.166 --> 32:24.166
Servant.

32:28.916 --> 32:30.125
This is your home.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.125
It'll always be your home.

32:35.291 --> 32:38.875
How dare you offer me the crumbs
from my own fucking table!

32:46.541 --> 32:48.041
I don't have to take this anymore.

32:48.125 --> 32:49.333
Then leave.

32:55.333 --> 32:56.208
Why should I?

33:08.083 --> 33:11.000
- [Robert grunts] Missed it.
- [Lina] I'm just embarrassing myself now.

33:11.083 --> 33:13.291
[Robert] Close though.
I think you're getting better.

33:13.375 --> 33:14.625
[groans]

33:15.958 --> 33:17.708
- [Jamie] What was that?
- [Robert laughing]

33:17.791 --> 33:19.541
[Jamie] Ugh, that was terrible.

33:19.625 --> 33:20.833
[Lina laughs]

33:23.291 --> 33:25.625
- I told you I was crap at tennis.
- [laughing]

33:25.708 --> 33:28.375
[Jamie] Crap is putting it mildly. Jesus.

33:28.458 --> 33:31.416
- [Lina] Now you're just showing off.
- [Robert] Nice. Nice.

33:32.791 --> 33:33.666
Get it! Get it!

33:33.750 --> 33:34.958
- [groaning]
- [Lina] Oh, my God!

33:35.041 --> 33:35.958
[laughs]

- [bartender] Scotch?

34:07.541 --> 34:08.375
Yeah.

34:08.875 --> 34:10.125
[bartender] There we go.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.833
- Evening.
- [Robert] Um…

34:26.125 --> 34:28.458
- I'll have a Shiraz.
- [bartender] Coming up.

- [exhales]
- [Robert] Is… everything okay?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.500
I shouldn't have come.

35:00.916 --> 35:02.500
[Robert] I'll drive you home if you like.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.791
Yes.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.875
Robert's coming over
for dinner this evening.

37:35.375 --> 37:37.250
Perhaps you'd give us all
a little concert?

37:38.208 --> 37:39.041
[chuckles] What?

37:40.041 --> 37:41.708
Oh. I couldn't.

37:42.541 --> 37:43.583
It's my birthday.

37:46.958 --> 37:48.166
I know.

37:48.250 --> 37:52.291
It's just I'm so out of practice.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.916
[scoffs] It's only family.
No need to impress us.

37:58.791 --> 37:59.625
Tell you what.

38:00.583 --> 38:02.541
Why don't we pick you out a nice dress?

38:03.333 --> 38:06.375
Something that shows off
that gorgeous young figure of yours.

38:14.916 --> 38:17.750
[Nicky] I used to watch you on the telly
all the time.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.708
You were a huge star.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.833
Oh, Katherine, what happened?

38:28.125 --> 38:29.375
What really happened?

38:31.625 --> 38:33.458
Right, I know this is a bit premature,

38:33.541 --> 38:38.666
but… this is an alphabet board.

38:39.875 --> 38:43.666
What's gonna happen,
I'm gonna read out the letters, out loud,

38:43.750 --> 38:44.833
and you're gonna blink.

- Oh.

40:03.291 --> 40:05.125
- It was no trouble.

Only a small piece for me.
I don't eat cake.

40:07.791 --> 40:10.208
- Since when?
- She's gutted now.

40:10.291 --> 40:11.750
She made it especially for you.

40:11.833 --> 40:14.000
- [Lina] I'm not gutted, Jamie.
- [Jamie] Liar.

40:17.291 --> 40:19.708
It looks delicious, Lina.

40:19.791 --> 40:21.083
[Lina grunts]

40:21.166 --> 40:24.208
We learned that tune together,
your mom and I.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.666
I vowed that if I ever got rich,

40:26.750 --> 40:30.875
the first thing I would do
is buy your mom a proper piano, so I did.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.916
You bought the piano?

40:37.333 --> 40:38.583
Did she not tell you?

40:40.666 --> 40:41.833
Hmm.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.958
We grew up together, Lina's mom and I.

40:47.041 --> 40:48.041
Danielle.

40:48.916 --> 40:52.833
We were like sisters.
I was always at her house. It was…

40:54.833 --> 40:56.291
safer than the foster home.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.750
I got out of poverty. She didn't.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.916
I became a Hollywood star.

41:06.625 --> 41:09.458
I didn't let it
affect our friendship, but, uh…

41:09.541 --> 41:11.333
[sniffles] …Danielle did.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.416
After I moved to America,
she stopped making any effort,

41:16.500 --> 41:19.875
and… the more I reached out to her,

41:19.958 --> 41:21.958
the more she cold-shouldered me,

41:22.041 --> 41:26.166
until eventually,
she more or less cut me out completely.

41:26.916 --> 41:28.333
Why would she do that?

41:32.250 --> 41:33.083
Jealousy.

41:36.916 --> 41:38.041
She broke my heart.

41:41.083 --> 41:44.208
Not the first person
to shatter my faith in humankind.

41:45.541 --> 41:46.875
Sadly, not the last.

41:53.041 --> 41:55.166
That piano cost me 12 grand.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.166
You abandoned her.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.541
[Katherine] If she told you that,
she lied.

42:00.625 --> 42:01.541
Bullshit!

42:02.750 --> 42:04.583
My mom wasn't a jealous person.

42:05.291 --> 42:07.166
You can bang on
about your own past all you want,

42:07.250 --> 42:10.125
but don't you dare
paint a false picture of my mother.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.125
She was… She was a million times
the woman you'll ever be.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.166
Sorry to disappoint you, Lina,

42:16.875 --> 42:20.458
but I was the one who maintained
our relationship, for your sake.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.666
I was the one who flew you out
to California on school holidays,

42:24.750 --> 42:26.500
who took you to Disneyland,

42:26.583 --> 42:28.958
who insisted I become your legal guardian!

42:29.458 --> 42:32.875
If it wasn't for me, you'd have ended up
in a foster home like I did.

42:34.333 --> 42:37.291
You wanted to come home with me.
You wanted to live with me.

42:37.916 --> 42:42.125
You hated that squalid little house
and your mom's bitterness and envy.

42:47.916 --> 42:50.125
That's why you blame yourself
for what happened.

42:54.791 --> 42:55.750
[groans]

43:00.541 --> 43:02.208
I don't have to listen to this.

43:04.333 --> 43:07.583
She hasn't spent the last ten years
crawling around trying to please us

43:07.666 --> 43:09.458
because she actually loves us.

43:09.541 --> 43:12.458
She's here for herself. She's using us.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.041
Using you?

43:28.250 --> 43:29.958
What use are you to me?

43:31.250 --> 43:34.208
This is my house now. Mine and Jamie's.

43:35.666 --> 43:38.000
And there's fuck all you can do about it.

43:48.625 --> 43:49.583
That told you.

43:52.125 --> 43:53.791
Should someone go after her?

43:54.791 --> 43:56.833
It's not me that she's in love with.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.500
It's Katherine.

44:12.250 --> 44:15.166
Ever since she got here,
all she ever wanted was your love.

44:19.833 --> 44:21.625
It's all either of us ever wanted.

I worked my ass off to become a doctor
just to please my father.

And it left me empty.

when I rang the bell?

You know, I… I know
about your little journal.

47:25.625 --> 47:28.000
I know about everything
that goes on in this house.

47:34.333 --> 47:35.708
I could have read it, but…

47:36.708 --> 47:39.333
but I didn't,
because I respect you too much.

47:50.875 --> 47:51.708
Read it.

47:52.208 --> 47:53.416
[Jamie sighs]

47:55.291 --> 47:56.708
You don't respect me.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.875
You just don't wanna know
how I really feel.

48:01.833 --> 48:04.791
- If it's so bad, why don't you just leave?
- Where would I go, Jamie?

48:06.291 --> 48:07.250
What would I do?

48:08.875 --> 48:10.958
I have no life outside of Rowling.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.583
You've never let me get a job.

48:14.708 --> 48:15.916
I don't know anyone.

48:16.625 --> 48:20.291
- I've…  I've never been anywhere.
- Do you think it's any different for me?

48:21.333 --> 48:26.500
Huh? You think I like being sick
and… and weak and needy like this?

48:27.000 --> 48:28.791
Locked in a body
that doesn't fucking work?

48:28.875 --> 48:30.250
You're not locked in.

48:31.708 --> 48:33.208
You <i>choose </i>this.

48:34.208 --> 48:35.083
You use sickness.

48:35.166 --> 48:38.416
You've used it your whole life
to keep yourself front and center,

48:38.500 --> 48:40.458
and you used it to get me!

48:40.541 --> 48:42.708
You and I made a deal.

I've protected you
from what goes on out there,

in a world where people disappear forever.

- Don't.

48:55.166 --> 48:57.125
But maybe if you'd have been there.

48:58.541 --> 49:01.625
Maybe if you'd have been there,
you would have heard her screams,

49:01.708 --> 49:03.625
but, no, you abandoned her.

49:05.041 --> 49:05.875
Didn't you?

You abandoned her, and you left her

You lose everything.

You would lose everything,
including your home.

I only want you.

Why can't we just leave? You and me?

50:01.791 --> 50:04.875
I am this family's GP.
That means I'm sleeping with a patient.

50:04.958 --> 50:08.916
If that got out, I would lose my practice
and very probably my license.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.125
They would ruin me.

50:10.708 --> 50:11.958
I won't let them.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.541
They've stolen my life from me.

If you want me…

50:29.333 --> 50:30.708
if you want us…

50:33.333 --> 50:34.875
then we have to be brave.

52:18.291 --> 52:20.166
Um, I made it myself.

52:21.541 --> 52:23.541
Well, Robert helped me,
but it was my idea.

52:24.041 --> 52:26.708
Thinking a nice, romantic picnic
on the island.

52:26.791 --> 52:29.458
That was his suggestion.
He's quite the ladies' man, our Robert.

52:29.958 --> 52:31.375
You should hear some of his stories.

52:31.458 --> 52:32.666
Tart.

52:35.833 --> 52:36.916
The island?

52:37.000 --> 52:39.541
[Jamie] Yeah. Robert's gonna
row us out there, aren't you?

52:41.166 --> 52:43.416
Only if you're absolutely sure
you feel well enough.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.416
He thinks I'm scared. [chuckles]

52:45.500 --> 52:46.375
I'm not a coward.

52:47.333 --> 52:50.208
You're not strong enough to swim, Jamie.
You've never even learned.

52:50.291 --> 52:52.833
Lina, we're only going on a boat.
It'll be fine.

52:52.916 --> 52:54.583
Come on, let's… let's do this.

52:54.666 --> 52:56.208
It's about to start raining.

52:56.791 --> 52:58.375
Look, live a little. Come on.

52:58.875 --> 53:01.250
You're always saying
I ought to do more exercise.

53:01.791 --> 53:04.541
And… I wanna make it up to you.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.541
Show you that I don't have to
always be such a bloody misery.

53:10.291 --> 53:12.750
Look, I'm sorry about what I said.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.875
All right, forgive me?

53:14.958 --> 53:18.916
You're the last person in the world
that I'd wanna hurt. I love you.

53:20.000 --> 53:20.875
I love you too.

53:20.958 --> 53:22.125
Let's go. Okay.

53:23.041 --> 53:24.166
- [Robert] Okay?
- [Jamie] Yep.

53:31.583 --> 53:35.583
There are people on the other side
of the island, cutting down trees.

53:36.125 --> 53:36.958
I know.

53:38.625 --> 53:39.500
Do as I say.

53:45.125 --> 53:46.250
Get in the boat.

53:47.250 --> 53:48.833
[Jamie] Now who's the one that's scared?

53:49.416 --> 53:51.541
Will she get in? Won't she get in?

53:52.166 --> 53:54.625
Come on, Lina.
It's only a little boat ride.

53:54.708 --> 53:56.083
Don't be a spoilsport.

53:58.583 --> 53:59.916
[exhales]

54:01.500 --> 54:03.291
[Jamie] Finally.
It wasn't that hard, was it?

54:08.458 --> 54:10.250
This is exciting, no?

54:20.750 --> 54:21.583
It's cold.

54:28.541 --> 54:29.625
There's a nice spot.

54:31.125 --> 54:33.583
See that? That sandy bit.
We're going past it.

54:35.750 --> 54:36.750
Where are you going?

54:47.125 --> 54:49.458
Whoa, what are you doing?
You're missing the bloody island.

54:51.250 --> 54:54.000
[chain saws whirring]

54:59.916 --> 55:01.916
[panting]

55:04.041 --> 55:04.916
[Robert grunts]

55:05.750 --> 55:07.750
[chain saws continue whirring]

55:15.625 --> 55:18.791
[whirring]

55:25.166 --> 55:29.250
You've dropped the oar, you idiot.
He's not much of a boatman, is he?

55:34.125 --> 55:35.083
Careful.

55:36.958 --> 55:38.041
Robert, what are you doing?

55:38.791 --> 55:40.666
- [Lina panting]
- Robert, stop!

55:42.750 --> 55:45.833
- [panting]
- [loud creaking]

55:49.000 --> 55:50.333
[gasps]

55:51.958 --> 55:52.833
Jamie!

56:04.333 --> 56:06.583
[gasping] Robert!

56:09.500 --> 56:13.166
[both gasping]

56:14.625 --> 56:16.125
[muffled grunting]

56:19.333 --> 56:22.375
[muffled grunting]

56:22.958 --> 56:23.833
[Jamie shouts]

56:23.916 --> 56:26.291
[bubbling]

56:38.208 --> 56:41.041
[gasps, coughs]

56:42.958 --> 56:44.916
- Help!
- Jamie!

56:45.791 --> 56:47.041
Jamie!

56:47.750 --> 56:50.000
[gasps]

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
[dramatic music playing]

57:09.458 --> 57:10.833
[music continues]

57:10.916 --> 57:13.500
[no audible dialogue]

57:16.458 --> 57:19.125
Jamie! Jamie!

57:19.208 --> 57:21.250
No, no, no!

57:21.333 --> 57:22.833
[gasps] No!

57:22.916 --> 57:25.708
[continues shouting]

58:04.083 --> 58:06.083
[bubbling]

58:11.291 --> 58:13.750
[oxygen cylinder hissing]

58:23.083 --> 58:25.083
[rain pattering]

58:30.250 --> 58:32.250
[sobbing]

58:41.500 --> 58:42.916
[gasps]

58:46.666 --> 58:48.750
[Lina sobbing, muffled]

59:03.000 --> 59:05.333
- [sobbing continues]
- [exhales]

59:19.625 --> 59:21.750
[Nicky] Well, you must
have known he couldn't swim.

59:23.208 --> 59:24.750
It was in the local paper.

59:27.875 --> 59:29.583
Whose idea was the boat trip?

59:34.083 --> 59:34.916
[Lina] Jamie's.

59:38.291 --> 59:39.625
- [Nicky] Really?
- [exhales]

59:40.125 --> 59:42.375
[Nicky] Hmm? It wasn't Dr. Lawrence's?

59:44.166 --> 59:47.375
I've seen you both.
I've seen the way you are together.

59:49.041 --> 59:50.791
How long's it been going on?

59:53.333 --> 59:55.875
How long have you
been seeing Dr. Lawrence?

59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.958
The boat capsized.

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.541
We all fell in. I…

01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:10.041
I tried to save him, but he… he kept
flailing around, dragging me down.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.833
[Nicky] And then, um…

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.416
[clicks tongue] …what, you, uh…

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.375
you couldn't divorce him
because you'd lose everything?

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:20.750
It tipped!

01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.875
I… I don't remember why.
One of them must have lent over too far.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:26.750
Is that why Jamie had to drown?

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.833
Look, the police, they're not gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.

01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:33.750
They're not.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.041
The fact that you were dragged into this

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:39.916
by a doctor that everybody trusts.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.666
Except me.

01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:48.083
A doctor that deliberately
over-prescribed painkillers

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:50.375
to a patient he wanted to get rid of.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:52.833
Lina, listen.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.916
I know what it's like
to be pushed into a corner

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.583
when you're too frightened
to speak out against him.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.125
No one dragged me into anything.

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:07.208
[classical music playing]

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:32.500
[gasps]

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:51.875
[music continues]

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.500
[muffled gurgling]

01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.750
[gurgling]

01:02:48.583 --> 01:02:50.291
[groans softly]

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:05.291

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.666
[gasps]

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:22.000
[panting]

01:03:47.916 --> 01:03:49.125
[panting]

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.041
[Lina exhales, gasps]

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:09.208
[panting]

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.583
[screams]

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
[Robert] Shh!

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:20.416
[footsteps thumping]

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:24.041
[Lina gasps]

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.500
[Lina] He comes at night.

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:38.791
What are those?

01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:44.000
- Something to help you sleep.
- [exhales]

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:50.750
I have to go.

01:04:53.666 --> 01:04:55.375
I don't care where. Just far.

01:04:58.041 --> 01:05:00.125
We can never be happy here, Robert.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:02.541
Not with her.

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.000
- If she--
- Sell the house.

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:08.291
What?

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.625
It's yours to sell now.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.583
It's… It's Katherine's home.

01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:19.041
Forget about Katherine.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:25.000
I can't… I can't sell it. I promised her.

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.375
Then what's the sense in what we did?

01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:33.625
I risked everything for you.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.000
For us.

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:41.000
This is how we get free, Lina.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.958
If you sell Rowling, we'll never
have to worry about money again.

01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:51.208
Is… Is that what this is all about?

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.250
- Money?
- No, it's about freedom.

01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:56.041
Yours, as well as mine.

01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:01.125
I won't do it.

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:22.916
Where did you get that?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.291
It's all in here, Lina.

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:27.791
Your bile.

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:32.541
Page after page of murderous fantasy.

01:06:32.625 --> 01:06:34.166
You even talk about drowning him.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:36.791
[Lina] Give it back! No!

01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:40.041
[sobbing]

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:43.291
You may think you're a good person,
but you're not.

01:06:45.541 --> 01:06:46.916
You're no better than me,

01:06:48.541 --> 01:06:50.375
except that you're a coward,

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:52.541
so you let me do your dirty work.

01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:54.166
I held onto him.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.500
Yes, but how tightly?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.666
You seduced me.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:03.125
Then you took your husband,
who can't swim,

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.125
out on the lake without a life jacket,
and you capsized the boat.

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:09.458
- It was you!
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:13.375
Because I thought you loved me.

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:15.958
[thunder crashes]

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.833

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:41.875
[thunder continues crashing]

01:07:49.458 --> 01:07:50.708
Katherine!

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:56.666
Katherine.

[soft thudding]

01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:10.291
Lina, what's wrong?

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:15.291
Get out of my way.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.583
Excuse me.

01:09:21.958 --> 01:09:23.833
I said move.

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:26.666
You bitch.

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:29.708
Cat out of the bag, is it?

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.666

01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:36.208

[gasps] I loved you!

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.083
Come back. Come back to the house.

01:09:58.416 --> 01:09:59.791
[gasps] My house.

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:02.125
Just come.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:03.541
[Lina shouts]

01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:04.958
Get off!

Stop!

Lina, let me explain!

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.291
You're the one I love. Not her!

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:31.333
[panting]

01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:33.750
[Robert] Lina, wait. Stop.

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:35.875
Oh, fuck.

01:10:37.708 --> 01:10:39.541
[muffled] Lina, where are you?

01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:42.166
Lina.

Lina.

- [Robert, muffled] Look, I need to get in.
- [Katherine] I know!

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.500
Why are you trying to talk to her?

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:52.291
- [Robert] To stop her going to the police.
- [Katherine] Let me try.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.375
Lina.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.791
Lina, come out,
and we can talk about this.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:00.666
[Robert whispers] She's not gonna
wanna talk, not after what's happened.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.291
She'll be scared. [grunts]

Hey, you'll have to be quick.
'Cause me battery's about to run out.

01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:20.750
Are you sure?

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:24.791
Can you make sure that,
um, she's… she's not left alone?

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:27.875
Right. I'll be there as soon as possible.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:31.833
Come on.

01:16:34.125 --> 01:16:35.916
Is he really worth protecting?

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:57.083
Come on, then. [sighs]

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.791
Fuck a duck.

01:17:02.666 --> 01:17:03.500
Right.

01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:05.208
Again.

Yes.

01:17:08.666 --> 01:17:10.791
Hallelujah!

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:14.958
Right. We're gonna start by you telling me
exactly what happened, all right?

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:18.500
I think I know,
but you need to tell me I'm right.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:19.833
Okay.

01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:36.291
Calm down.

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:38.166
[Robert] She tried to kill you, Lina.

01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:40.416
[Lina] I know that.

01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:44.750
[Robert] I tried to stop her.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.083
- [Lina] Bullshit.
- [Robert exhales]

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:50.000
[Lina] But if you go down, so do I.

01:18:51.041 --> 01:18:52.708
So we have to work together on this.

01:18:54.750 --> 01:18:57.041
And what exactly do you suggest we do?

01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.250
We take her home.

01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:04.166
Now.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.416
Before she can talk to the police.

01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:11.250
And then what?

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:16.666
We finish this.

01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:28.541
Yeah, uh, police, please. Police.

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.125
But I have to protect myself.

01:21:39.416 --> 01:21:41.250
[pills rattling]

01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:45.416
[Robert] People with locked-in syndrome
usually suffer sudden, violent strokes.

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:50.125
Morphine and something to counteract
the blood thinner should do it.

01:21:50.708 --> 01:21:52.666
She has a lot of medication
in her bloodstream,

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.458
which should cover our tracks.

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.041
What will we tell the police?

01:21:59.125 --> 01:22:02.750
She was thrown from her horse.
She sustained serious head injuries.

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:06.041
She wandered into the road and got hit
by a driver who fled the scene.

01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:07.291
It's all in the police report.

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.208
Whatever she told that nurse,
she was confused.

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.833
I discharged her. You brought her home.

01:22:11.916 --> 01:22:13.250
She died in her sleep.

01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:16.541
[line ringing]

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:19.916
Oh, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.333
They won't believe us.

01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:25.416
Doesn't matter what they think,
as long as they can't prove it.

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.875
[gasping softly]

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.000
- What are you doing?
- [Lina] Worried about dents in the car.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.000
I fixed it.

01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.666
Not properly.
You can still see a dent in the bumper.

01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:06.791
Are you sure?

01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:10.083
You need to clean the grill with alcohol,
in case of any traces.

01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:12.708
For all we know,
the police are on their way. Hurry!

01:23:12.791 --> 01:23:14.625
[exhales] Oh, fuck.

01:23:26.625 --> 01:23:28.333
There's nothing fucking here.

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:34.458
Let her go.

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:39.291
We've still got the diary.

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.791
There's nothing she can do to hurt us.

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:48.416
Let her go. This was all a mistake.

01:25:53.166 --> 01:25:55.541
[panting]

01:25:55.625 --> 01:25:57.125
You love her, Robert.

I despise the fucking pair of you.

01:26:01.875 --> 01:26:03.333
If you hurt Lina,

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.041
