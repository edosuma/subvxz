00:20.399 --> 00:24.063
Only you

00:25.733 --> 00:30.193
Can make this world
seem right

00:31.399 --> 00:34.369
Only you

00:36.666 --> 00:40.466
Can make the darkness bright

00:42.766 --> 00:44.734
Only you

00:44.799 --> 00:46.859
And you alone

00:48.799 --> 00:52.531
Can thrill me like you do

00:54.000 --> 00:58.437
And fill my heart with love

00:58.500 --> 01:01.435
for only you

01:03.266 --> 01:07.293
Baby, only you

01:09.566 --> 01:13.730
Can make this change in me

01:15.599 --> 01:18.160
For it's true

01:20.433 --> 01:23.732
You are my destiny

01:26.000 --> 01:29.629
Stop pushing it. You're supposed to
let it happen, not force it.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.635
- I'm not pushing it. You are.
- I am not.

01:32.700 --> 01:35.533
You're doing it again.
You're pushing it. Stop it.

01:35.599 --> 01:38.034
Mom! Larry's pushing it!

01:38.099 --> 01:42.901
- Larry, don't push it.
- I'm not. It's moving itself.

01:42.966 --> 01:45.025
Wait.
I have to write this down.

01:46.599 --> 01:50.331
Grandma said everyone has a soul mate.
This way I'll know his name.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.131
The one I'm supposed to wait for.
The one that'll wait for me.

02:07.833 --> 02:11.428
But, Faith, what if this guy
lived a billion years ago?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.799
- What if he's a dead caveman?
- Don't be stupid, Larry.

02:14.866 --> 02:19.098
Soul mates are our destiny.
They live when we live.

02:19.166 --> 02:23.159
What if he lives here in Pittsburgh
and you just pass him on the street?

02:23.233 --> 02:27.829
It couldn't happen. I'd know.
Like when bees know how to make honey.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.926
And you'll know too,
cause you have one.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.025
We all do.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.331
Look.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.960
''Damon Bradley.''

03:07.500 --> 03:09.263
My other half?

03:10.233 --> 03:12.326
My soul mate.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.165
She wants to know
if she's going to marry Alex.

03:31.233 --> 03:34.669
I do not!
He doesn't even have a brain.

03:34.733 --> 03:38.692
He's got pretty eyes. That means
your kids would have pretty eyes.

03:38.766 --> 03:40.700
He can get a brain later.

03:40.766 --> 03:42.700
What do you think, Faith?

03:42.766 --> 03:46.133
The most important thing is true love.
Isn't that right, Kate?

03:46.199 --> 03:48.600
Look out below!

03:53.066 --> 03:55.000
Larry, I hate you!

03:55.066 --> 03:57.626
- Bill is gonna be so mad.
- I know.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.566
Next.

04:06.533 --> 04:09.969
So, what destiny do you wish
from Madame Divina?

04:12.466 --> 04:15.560
Just basic destiny stuff,
I guess.

04:15.633 --> 04:18.659
But I don't want to hear anything bad,
if that's okay.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.434
Something's coming to me.

04:40.399 --> 04:42.334
I'm getting a name.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.701
A name that is very important.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.433
David?

04:52.733 --> 04:53.995
No.

04:55.166 --> 04:56.599
Damon.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.991
His name...

05:01.066 --> 05:03.296
is Damon Bradley.

05:03.366 --> 05:05.630
Oh, my God.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.025
Your destiny is $ 2.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.433
The truth is...

05:21.500 --> 05:24.230
you make your own destiny.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.598
Understand?

05:26.666 --> 05:29.601
Don't wait for it to come to you.

05:34.199 --> 05:37.533
14 years later

05:42.866 --> 05:45.528
''From the Latin root destinare...

05:45.600 --> 05:48.694
meaning, to have destination...

05:48.766 --> 05:50.700
to journey...

05:50.766 --> 05:54.862
to take a trip where the events
are totally predetermined.''

05:55.833 --> 05:57.824
Imagine that.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.631
The motion
of like attracting like.

06:01.699 --> 06:05.761
The motion
of a divine preordination.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.435
Okay. Look.
One hand, two hands.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.933
Put them together...

06:12.899 --> 06:15.300
and what do they make?

06:15.366 --> 06:17.027
One.

06:17.100 --> 06:21.264
Right! So, Plato tells us
we began in circles.

06:21.333 --> 06:25.326
When we strived to be like the gods,
we were punished by a thunderbolt...

06:25.399 --> 06:29.200
that struck us and cut us
right down dead center...

06:29.266 --> 06:30.790
in half.

06:30.866 --> 06:33.630
We scattered
to the ends of the earth...

06:33.699 --> 06:36.464
searching and searching...

06:36.533 --> 06:38.592
for our other half.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.328
Now, what Plato was saying...

06:41.399 --> 06:43.493
is that if we just stop...

06:43.566 --> 06:45.625
and go with the flow...

06:45.699 --> 06:48.134
and follow our destiny...

06:48.199 --> 06:51.135
it'll lead us back to each other.

06:52.766 --> 06:55.257
Okay, so following through
on this...

06:55.333 --> 06:57.494
read from your green book.

06:57.566 --> 07:00.091
Remember, one Wordsworth,
one Keats or one Shelley.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.827
Have a great holiday.

07:22.366 --> 07:24.391
Don't get up, leslie.
I got everything.

07:24.466 --> 07:27.697
- Kate, did you want me to help you?
- Oh, no. You might strain yourself.

07:27.766 --> 07:30.860
- I would've helped.
- What is all this? What's going on?

07:30.933 --> 07:34.494
Wine, candIes.
What is it?

07:35.199 --> 07:36.861
He proposed.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.457
Faith, that's great.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.797
Did he get down on his knees?

07:41.866 --> 07:45.461
Well, no.
He turned down his beeper.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.593
He's a doctor. He's practical.
He doesn't have to get on his knees.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.600
Did you guys set a date?

07:50.666 --> 07:54.466
Well, no. I don't think
we should rush into anything.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.467
Let me see the ring.

07:57.566 --> 07:59.329
Where is it?

07:59.399 --> 08:01.527
You don't have it on?

08:05.033 --> 08:07.228
- I'm blind. Oh, my goodness.
- It's so pretty.

08:07.300 --> 08:10.235
Where are my sunglasses?
It's gorgeous.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.734
- I hate you.
- Oh, my God.

08:14.566 --> 08:17.831
I asked him to give me 24 hours
to think about it.

08:17.899 --> 08:20.334
I'm never going
to get divorced, so...

08:23.500 --> 08:26.367
I'm telling you
what I told him...

08:26.433 --> 08:29.095
that I need time to reflect...

08:29.166 --> 08:32.158
and that I'm going to say ''yes.''

08:33.899 --> 08:36.390
I told my parents
I'm engaged.

08:36.466 --> 08:38.525
Oh, well
then it's official.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.693
- Dwayne. What a catch. He's a doctor.
- He's so intelligent, Faith.

08:41.765 --> 08:44.326
- He's a doctor. What do you want?
- Good sense of humor too.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.096
- He's got a mild sense of humor.
- He's a doctor. It's a tradeoff.

08:47.166 --> 08:49.464
He can't have a sense of humor too.
He saves lives.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.364
He's a foot doctor.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.958
He saves feet.
Feet are important.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.967
Plus, he's tall.
Your kids will be tall.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.934
Yeah. He's a sweetheart.
You don't have to sell me on him.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.991
He's as good as gold.

09:01.066 --> 09:03.000
What is it you're waiting for?

09:06.733 --> 09:08.166
I'm not waiting.

09:08.233 --> 09:10.167
Hey, Faith, grab me a beer.

09:10.233 --> 09:13.168
Faith, don't wait.
You wait, you'll wind up with nothing.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.797
Oh, yeah. Hi, Larry.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on.

09:19.866 --> 09:22.300
- My brother for you.
- Uh-oh.

09:22.366 --> 09:25.301
Stop it.
Don't eat my crust, Les.

09:28.233 --> 09:31.202
You still there?
I thought you'd be heading home by now.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.734
- I'm not. I'm here.
- What are you doing there?

09:33.799 --> 09:37.201
Hanging out with your sister and Leslie.
What is it? You miss me?

09:37.266 --> 09:41.032
Yeah, my heart is breaking for you.
Did you forget what night it is?

09:41.100 --> 09:43.068
The guys are coming over
for poker.

09:43.133 --> 09:45.761
Oh. I didn't know
you wanted me to play.

09:45.833 --> 09:51.032
Very funny. Get home, make some
sandwiches and pick up some beer.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.967
This is my one night out.
The kids are at Gus's.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.797
- Give me a break.
- Kate, I still got lots of work to do!

09:56.866 --> 09:58.697
Well, I've been in class
all day.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.427
Class?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.798
The guys are gonna be there
without anything to eat!

10:02.866 --> 10:04.800
I'm a woman, not a menu.

10:04.866 --> 10:07.596
All of a sudden
you're Helen Reddy.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.031
Get home!

10:09.100 --> 10:11.034
You're gonna embarrass me.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.433
Fend for yourself,
because I'm not coming home.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.161
I gotta go.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.395
What?

10:19.466 --> 10:21.866
It's Ezio Pinza.

10:21.933 --> 10:23.025
Ezio who?

10:23.100 --> 10:26.365
He was in South Pacific
with Mary Martin.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.301
Why don't they write songs
like this anymore?

10:32.366 --> 10:33.799
I've gotta get going.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.801
No, no, no.
You gotta stay and watch this.

10:38.399 --> 10:40.891
When you feel her call you

10:40.966 --> 10:45.232
Across a crowded room

10:45.299 --> 10:47.393
Then fly to her side

10:47.466 --> 10:51.197
Saw a psychiatrist on Donahue say
that love songs are just a cruel hoax...

10:51.266 --> 10:53.200
that feed people's fantasies.

10:53.266 --> 10:57.202
Romance on a daily basis?
Nobody has that.

10:57.266 --> 10:59.894
Yeah, but, Katy,
somebody wrote those songs.

10:59.966 --> 11:02.696
They came out of
somebody's experience.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.833
No, I think they came out of
someone's imagination.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.625
Once you have found him

11:10.700 --> 11:13.191
Never let him go

11:13.266 --> 11:16.758
Once you have found her

11:16.833 --> 11:19.267
Never

11:19.333 --> 11:22.700
Let her

11:22.766 --> 11:25.963
Go

11:36.500 --> 11:38.968
Oh, my gosh.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.431
Wow.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.498
- Oh, look how it sparkles.
- She's a beauty.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.124
Must've cost a lot.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.296
Yeah, I researched a lot of diamonds
and gemstones for this. Learned a lot.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.300
It's amazing how many variations
there are...

11:57.366 --> 12:00.301
of pure carbon
crystallized into octahedrons.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.132
But here's my real gemstone
right here.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.428
Sweet.

12:11.966 --> 12:14.901
- I know you don't like that. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Is it all off?

12:14.966 --> 12:17.434
- Yeah, I got it all.
- Great.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.492
You've got to show this
to Aunt Gloria and Aunt Lil.

12:20.566 --> 12:22.796
They came all the way
from Pottsville.

12:22.866 --> 12:25.164
- May I see it one more time?
- Oh, Leslie!

12:25.233 --> 12:27.724
Oh, my God!
It's the perfect size!

12:27.799 --> 12:29.734
Come on, sweetheart.

12:29.799 --> 12:31.495
I feel like crying.

12:31.566 --> 12:34.330
- I have a headache.
- Again?

12:34.399 --> 12:36.527
Yes, but not
one of those headaches.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.296
I have 50 bobby pins
holding my hair together.

12:39.366 --> 12:41.300
What is this?
It's down. Put it up.

12:41.366 --> 12:44.529
It's not exploitation.
Everybody wants money, right?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.659
That's what makes
this country great, doll.

12:46.733 --> 12:50.567
- Don't call me doll, okay?
- You used to love it.

12:50.633 --> 12:52.692
Well, you said it differently then.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.433
Faith?

12:56.733 --> 12:59.463
- Faith.
- Oh. Yes.

12:59.533 --> 13:01.831
I wore it,
my daughter wore it...

13:01.899 --> 13:04.835
and I want you
to have the same joy.

13:07.066 --> 13:11.002
And I must say I was thrilled
when Dwayne said you would wear it.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.033
Dwayne?

13:17.433 --> 13:19.993
- Where are you going?
- She's got another of her headaches.

13:20.066 --> 13:23.934
It's a bobby-pin headache, Mom.
Talk to you later, Les.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.094
- We're going. Can I have the keys?
- I've got the keys. Let's go.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.430
Well, good night, okay?
Call me early.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.832
Faith, I gotta go.

13:31.899 --> 13:33.834
Call you tomorrow.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.927
- It would mean a lot to her.
- It means a lot to me too, Dwayne.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.935
- She's not a young woman anymore.
- She's already been married twice.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.936
Surely we can do this one little thing
for her. Will you think about it?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.594
- The thing is, you didn't ask me.
- Oh, my God.

13:48.666 --> 13:52.363
Here comes your crazy uncle Pat.
He wants to take another picture.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.799
- Ask me next time.
- Let me fix your hair.

13:54.866 --> 13:58.029
- It's supposed to be like that.
- There. Now you're perfect.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.795
One more. Good one.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.795
- Sorry I'm late, Faith.
- Don't look!

14:13.866 --> 14:16.596
Oh, dear. Okay.
Guess what. I'm free.

14:16.666 --> 14:19.658
My mom and dad took the kids
to the lake for Labor Day...

14:19.733 --> 14:22.668
so I was running around
getting that stuff together.

14:22.733 --> 14:25.531
- Dwayne's not coming over, is he?
- No.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.534
He had emergency surgery.

14:35.133 --> 14:36.828
You can look.

14:41.933 --> 14:43.195
Wow!

14:44.266 --> 14:47.133
Faith, that's a dress.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.168
I've decided it's romantic...

14:49.233 --> 14:52.168
wearing the gown of the woman
who bore your husband.

14:52.233 --> 14:55.134
I mean, my daughter
will wear it too...

14:55.200 --> 14:56.599
someday...

14:56.666 --> 14:58.361
maybe... not.

14:58.433 --> 15:01.266
Wait a second.
Put the veil on.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.267
It'll be okay.

15:07.733 --> 15:10.361
- Sweet of her, wasn't it?
- Yes.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.368
lf l had this dress,
I'd give it to someone.

15:14.733 --> 15:17.930
- I look like a muffin.
- No, you look fine.

15:20.466 --> 15:22.730
Did it come with the soundtrack?

15:22.799 --> 15:25.325
I think it's built in here
somewhere.

15:25.399 --> 15:27.630
There's probably
plenty of things.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.760
It's the thickness.
We'll fix it. Don't worry.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.767
I'll pin it a little bit.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.767
We'll see what we can do.

15:37.299 --> 15:41.168
- Life's not like it is in the movies.
- No, it's not.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.634
Although from day one
everyone conspires to tell you it is.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.962
Your mother, your father.

15:46.033 --> 15:49.799
Teachers, priests, everybody.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.859
Dreams come true. The good guy wins.
People live happily ever after.

15:53.933 --> 15:55.867
All that crap.

15:55.933 --> 15:58.800
Then one day you wake up
and realize that...

15:58.866 --> 16:00.731
your life should be...

16:00.799 --> 16:02.461
different.

16:04.966 --> 16:08.527
Katy, dreams aren't crap.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.934
Okay, what about
unforgettable moments?

16:15.133 --> 16:17.397
You can't tell me
you don't have...

16:17.466 --> 16:19.195
one memorable,
unforgettable moment...

16:19.266 --> 16:21.700
because I know
you've had thousands of them.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.662
We're having one right now.
I'm in my wedding dress.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.295
Those are the things to notice.

16:36.100 --> 16:37.533
Kate, what's wrong?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.433
l don't know.

16:43.833 --> 16:47.200
Faith, I gotta talk to you
about something.

16:47.266 --> 16:48.358
What?

16:49.933 --> 16:52.367
Larry and l, we're just--

16:56.366 --> 16:58.766
I'm sorry.
l have to answer.

16:58.833 --> 17:01.768
Dwayne's having his calls forwarded.
Don't move.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.534
- Dr. Dwayne Johnson, please.
- He's not in at the moment.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.626
He's doing an emergency matrixectomy.
Can I take a message?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.669
- Who's this?
- faith, his fiancée. Who's this?

17:17.733 --> 17:21.601
Hi. I'm a high school buddy of Dwayne's.
Congratulations on your wedding.

17:21.665 --> 17:24.464
- Thanks.
- I'll be in Europe, so I'll miss it.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.762
- Aw, that's too bad.
- Be careful.

17:26.833 --> 17:28.493
What's your name?

17:28.566 --> 17:31.626
I can hardly hear you.
Can you spell it?

17:31.700 --> 17:34.168
Yeah. D-A-M-O-N...

17:34.233 --> 17:36.531
B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.

17:43.299 --> 17:45.393
- HeIlo? Are you okay?
- What?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.764
What's going on?
Who is it?

17:50.400 --> 17:52.595
- Damon Bradley?
- Yeah?

17:52.666 --> 17:55.260
- Where are you?
- I'm at the airport. Why?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.766
- Where are you going?
- To Venice. Why?

18:00.266 --> 18:01.631
I love Venice!

18:01.700 --> 18:04.999
I gotta run now, but maybe someday
we can all get together.

18:12.099 --> 18:14.295
He hung up.
He hung up.

18:14.366 --> 18:17.301
It's okay, honey.
If he calls you once, he'll call back.

18:17.366 --> 18:20.563
- Get me out of this.
- Hold on. There's a million buttons.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.500
Whoa! Spin! Spin! Spin!

18:25.333 --> 18:27.267
Jesus.
Where are you going?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.324
To the airport.
Call a cab.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.836
- You can't just go to the airport!
- I'll be downstairs.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.925
Change your dress!

18:42.799 --> 18:44.791
Faith!
It's a coincidence!

18:44.866 --> 18:48.267
It is not a coincidence.
You don't understand. It's fate.

18:48.333 --> 18:51.268
I just wanna get a look at him,
that's all.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.767
Come on, Faith!
This is insane!

19:11.200 --> 19:13.760
- Stop!
- Be careful!

19:13.833 --> 19:15.733
- Oh, God.
- Watch it.

19:15.799 --> 19:17.597
Good luck!

19:20.333 --> 19:21.425
Sorry!

19:33.333 --> 19:34.664
Excuse me, sisters.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.891
Flight 411?

19:41.966 --> 19:44.901
The flight's closed.
Your boarding pass, please.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.867
I misplaced it.

19:47.933 --> 19:52.336
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass
we cannot let you on the plane.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.223
- It's here somewhere.
- Great.

19:55.299 --> 19:58.827
Until you find it,
we can't let you on the plane.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.733
Look, this is a real emergency.

20:01.799 --> 20:06.703
Please let me on for just one second.
I really need to see somebody onboard.

20:06.766 --> 20:10.668
I'm sorry. We have very strict rules.
They are for your own safety.

20:10.733 --> 20:13.133
You could affect my life.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.958
Just a moment, please.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.200
This is Eric over at TWA.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.429
We have a 237 on our hands here.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.123
Uh-huh.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.531
Yeah.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.862
Thanks.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.834
It'll be just a moment.

20:52.366 --> 20:55.665
The man I was supposed to marry
is on that plane.

21:02.166 --> 21:05.101
I'm telling you,
it is a miracle.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.158
There is no such thing
as a coincidence.

21:11.233 --> 21:14.293
Kate, if I don't get on that plane
I am going to regret it.

21:14.366 --> 21:18.302
No, not today, but tomorrow
and for the rest or my life.

21:19.733 --> 21:22.827
It's Labor Day weekend.
I don't have classes till Wednesday.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.364
Thank you!

21:27.533 --> 21:30.331
Okay, my passport's
in the top left drawer.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.767
Pack all my nice underwear,
anything non-wrinkly.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.323
Don't forget my blow dryer.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.463
Oh, Katy, you gotta hurry. The plane
leaves in an hour and 12 minutes.

21:54.733 --> 21:56.598
Faith! Faith!

21:57.766 --> 22:00.894
- My God, you smashed that lady.
- Oh, I didn't hurt anyone.

22:00.966 --> 22:03.161
- Nice jacket.
- Hi.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.360
- I'm coming with you.
- Are you crazy?

22:05.433 --> 22:08.334
Oh, yeah. I'm crazy.
Sorry.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.829
You can't go alone.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.562
What if you make a mistake
you'll always regret?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.534
Do I need to remind you
your wedding is in ten days?

22:16.599 --> 22:20.764
Katy, look, I know you think
this is irresponsible...

22:20.833 --> 22:24.098
but think how much more irresponsible
it would be...

22:24.166 --> 22:26.100
to marry the wrong person.

22:26.166 --> 22:30.193
- I packed jeans and a dress.
- God, I wish l had a passport.

22:31.066 --> 22:32.624
Excuse me.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.965
I also packed that little red dress
you never have the guts to wear.

22:36.033 --> 22:37.694
I got the blow dryer.

22:37.766 --> 22:41.031
Just get an adapter before
you plug it in. It could blow up.

22:43.166 --> 22:45.259
Why are we doing this?
It's insane.

22:45.333 --> 22:49.997
What if Dwayne and I aren't meant to be?
It's not fair for me to waste his life.

22:50.066 --> 22:52.694
She's right.
What if he's really her soul mate?

22:52.766 --> 22:55.701
He's not her soul mate.
She's never even met this man.

22:55.766 --> 22:59.202
She's waited her whole life for somebody
with a name she got off a board game...

22:59.266 --> 23:01.860
when she was 11.

23:01.933 --> 23:04.299
You forgot about
the fortune teller.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.434
Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.593
- We only got five minutes.
- Oh, God.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.600
Bye, you guys.
Have a good time.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.267
- Oh, my God.
- It's your hoops.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.427
- Coming from or going to the wedding?
- Going. Come on.

23:25.833 --> 23:27.266
Good-bye.

23:29.333 --> 23:33.667
So we're gonna fly to Italy and comb the
streets looking for a total stranger.

23:33.733 --> 23:35.667
He's going to Venice, right?
Small city.

23:35.733 --> 23:38.668
So I called six hotels
and found out where he's staying.

23:38.733 --> 23:41.258
Let's go, girls.
You'll miss the happy day.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.767
We'll see him tomorrow
and be back the next day?

23:43.833 --> 23:47.064
Exactly. He's registered
at the Hotel Danieli.

23:47.133 --> 23:50.261
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- We get all kinds here, don't we?

23:50.333 --> 23:51.595
Unbelievable.

24:05.466 --> 24:07.297
Hotel Danieli?

24:10.266 --> 24:13.394
So many planes.
l have motion sickness.

24:13.466 --> 24:15.331
- Oh, my God.
- A boat?

24:15.400 --> 24:17.527
- It's gonna be great.
- No, it's not.

24:17.599 --> 24:20.535
- I don't feel well, Faith. I'm tired.
- Give me your hand.

24:20.599 --> 24:23.626
I'm a very good friend.
Do you realize that?

24:50.633 --> 24:53.101
''The most serene.''

24:53.166 --> 24:57.603
Where people come looking for something
they can't find anyplace else.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.935
- Faith, this is a Lifestyles hotel.
- What?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.934
Lifestyles or the rich and famous.
We can't afford this.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.934
Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.766
Kate.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.366
He could be anywhere.

26:37.566 --> 26:38.999
Come on.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.094
Reservations
for Faith Corvatch, please.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.494
You could put the room
on this.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.468
Could you please tell us
what room Mr. Bradley is in?

27:01.533 --> 27:02.966
Yes.

27:06.266 --> 27:08.200
I can't stand it.

27:11.533 --> 27:14.127
I'm sorry. Mr. Bradley
has already checked out.

27:18.599 --> 27:20.124
Excuse me?

27:22.400 --> 27:24.368
He just arrived today.

27:27.033 --> 27:30.196
Mr. Bradley left
about half an hour ago.

27:30.266 --> 27:32.461
Would you prefer an interior or--

27:32.533 --> 27:35.468
You're saying he checked in,
then checked out? No.

27:35.533 --> 27:38.468
You must be mistaken.
He's supposed to be here now.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.529
I'm very sorry.
Perhaps you misunderstood.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.595
Perhaps you misunderstood.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.258
Please check again, sir.

27:47.333 --> 27:52.168
lf you would check again, we'd really
appreciate it. Thank you. Damon Bradley.

27:52.233 --> 27:54.326
With a ''B.''

27:58.633 --> 28:01.693
Room 217.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.700
His key has been returned.

28:06.766 --> 28:09.064
I'm afraid your friend
has departed.

28:09.133 --> 28:11.294
Did he leave
any forwarding information?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.492
Which way did he go?

28:14.566 --> 28:18.798
I don't know.
We don't usually follow our guests.

28:18.866 --> 28:22.859
Excuse me, sir.
I don't think you understand.

28:22.933 --> 28:26.130
My friend has traveled a long way
to find this gentleman.

28:26.200 --> 28:29.829
Anything you can do to help us
we would appreciate. Anything at all.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.993
What?
I was just getting going.

28:58.466 --> 29:01.902
Oh, he ate breakfast.
Thank God, 'cause I'm starving.

29:07.666 --> 29:10.829
I think this is the room
Cathy lee Crosby stayed in.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.333
Garbage. Good idea.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.630
Columbo always
goes through the garbage.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.964
Butterfinger. Butterfinger.

29:17.033 --> 29:18.330
- Map.
- Three Butterfingers.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.028
- Banana.
- Map? Is anything circled?

29:22.099 --> 29:24.364
- Telephone message.
- Let me see.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.196
It's in Italian.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.700
We'll get somebody to read it.
Let's go.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.934
This is a phone number in Rome.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.935
You'd like me to call this number
and what?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.491
Ask for Damon Bradley.

29:40.566 --> 29:42.864
- Just ask, that's all.
- Okay.

29:42.933 --> 29:44.025
Thank you.

29:44.933 --> 29:47.925
And ask whoever answers
if they know Mr. Bradley.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.592
Okay.

29:49.666 --> 29:51.793
- Or where we might find him.
- Okay.

29:53.733 --> 29:56.668
I'd ask for him first,
then go on to the other things.

29:56.733 --> 29:58.200
Okay!

30:05.700 --> 30:07.861
Oh, my God.
He's a priest?

30:07.933 --> 30:09.298
It's a store in Rome.

30:24.333 --> 30:29.134
He said some woman he works with
knows him.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.100
Her name's Anna.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.134
But she won't be in
till tomorrow.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.498
- let's go Rome.
- Rome?

30:35.566 --> 30:37.500
Rome? Tomorrow?

30:37.566 --> 30:41.662
Tomorrow is sciopero generale.
Everybody will be on strike.

30:44.333 --> 30:46.164
Good luck.

30:48.433 --> 30:51.368
Everybody's on strike?
No planes, buses, trains?

30:51.433 --> 30:54.869
Nobody shows up for work?
What kind of country is this?

31:11.333 --> 31:14.268
The point is, we've been
on the wrong road for an hour.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.359
No, no, no.
The point is, we're looping.

31:17.433 --> 31:22.928
We looped back around to that freeway
or turnpike or whatever they call it.

31:34.566 --> 31:36.500
- Which way do we loop?
- Right.

31:38.133 --> 31:40.067
Left. Right.

31:40.133 --> 31:41.566
Kate!

32:03.700 --> 32:06.635
I told you a liter
was less than a gallon.

32:09.166 --> 32:12.602
We would've had enough gas
if you hadn't gotten us lost.

32:15.066 --> 32:18.001
Besides, a kilometer
is less than a mile.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.034
Right. Less than a mile.

32:20.099 --> 32:23.536
So we should have been able
to cover more of them.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.100
This is great.

32:45.099 --> 32:48.035
I wonder what time it is
in Pittsburgh.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.834
Sorry I got us lost.

33:05.933 --> 33:07.867
I'm sorry I'm so edgy.

33:09.433 --> 33:11.367
I'm afraid we're losing him.

33:21.033 --> 33:24.469
I didn't tell him I was going
to the lake with the kids.

33:25.533 --> 33:27.967
I told him
I was leaving him.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.934
Leaving him?

33:33.433 --> 33:35.367
I think he's having an affair.

33:36.633 --> 33:40.069
- How do you know? Did he say something?
- No.

33:40.133 --> 33:42.863
- Did you see him with her?
- No.

33:42.933 --> 33:44.867
- How do you know?
- I just know.

33:51.599 --> 33:53.795
Kate...

33:53.866 --> 33:56.801
remember in junior high
when l had that Halloween party...

33:56.866 --> 33:59.164
and we all played Twister?

33:59.233 --> 34:01.428
You started to fall...

34:01.500 --> 34:03.866
and instead of taking the spot...

34:03.933 --> 34:05.867
Larry reached out to catch you.

34:07.299 --> 34:10.929
He let you win.
He never let anybody win.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.492
That's when I knew
he was head over heels.

34:17.565 --> 34:19.500
That was a long time ago.

34:21.166 --> 34:23.429
You know what I thought then?

34:23.500 --> 34:25.592
I thought...

34:25.666 --> 34:29.261
l hope someday l have somebody
who loves me that much.

34:33.065 --> 34:35.000
I know he loves you.

34:37.632 --> 34:40.193
I know he would kill tigers
for you.

35:16.233 --> 35:20.533
Okay, Mr. Cronenworth.
Let's check out this big guy here.

35:20.599 --> 35:22.124
He looks pretty good.

35:23.699 --> 35:28.467
This is a very simple procedure.
Won't take but about five minutes.

35:28.533 --> 35:31.468
I'm just gonna make
a plaster mold of your foot.

35:31.533 --> 35:33.467
Dwayne, I gotta talk to you.

35:33.533 --> 35:37.060
- Larry, I'm plastering a foot.
- It'll just take a second. Excuse me.

35:37.133 --> 35:39.431
- Where's Faith?
- At a teacher's conference.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.434
- Get out!
- Did she mention Kate?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.832
- She talks about Kate all the time.
- I think they're together.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.333
What?

35:46.400 --> 35:47.628
Kate left me.

35:49.233 --> 35:52.225
I got home and there was a note
saying ''I'm leaving.'' That's it.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.359
- No explanation, no nothing.
- Jesus. What happened?

35:54.433 --> 35:58.460
She's been acting kinda weird lately.
I should've seen it coming.

35:58.533 --> 36:01.229
Babbling on and on about communication,
like I don't know how to communicate.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.234
Do you believe this woman?
I'm sorry.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.699
Sorry, Mr. Cronenworth.

36:05.833 --> 36:07.801
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.697
That's what I'm saying.

36:12.566 --> 36:16.229
- Have you been fooling around?
- No. Of course not.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.734
Where you get that crazy idea?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.633
I've got to finish this foot mold.
I will call you tonight.

36:21.699 --> 36:23.634
You hear anything,
let me know.

36:23.699 --> 36:24.928
Good luck, sir.

36:27.199 --> 36:29.134
It's just my future
brother-in-law.

36:29.199 --> 36:30.827
Sorry about that.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.664
This is going to be
a very nice mold.

37:10.433 --> 37:11.866
Taxi !

37:13.666 --> 37:15.759
- Get in.
- I got it. Go, go.

37:20.599 --> 37:22.761
Not a monastery.
It's a store.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.666
No priests.
You know where that is?

37:25.733 --> 37:28.600
- He knows where it is.
- I'm just asking to make sure.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.595
I don't know why we had to return
the rental car. I would've found it.

37:39.666 --> 37:42.601
We had to return the rental car
because you had us lost.

37:43.966 --> 37:46.696
- What?
- We're here already?

37:46.766 --> 37:48.859
- I told you we were close.
- Some trip.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.366
Don't tip him.

38:05.066 --> 38:06.328
Oh, good.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.198
I'm looking for a woman
named Anna.

38:09.266 --> 38:11.200
I am Anna.

38:12.833 --> 38:16.394
Hi. I'm Faith. You don't know
how happy I am to meet you.

38:16.466 --> 38:20.027
You see, I'm looking for somebody
and I was hoping someone here--

38:20.099 --> 38:23.126
Well, you-- might know him.

38:23.199 --> 38:24.292
Damon Bradley.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.433
You know him?

38:34.699 --> 38:36.998
Okay, slow down.
What's going on?

38:37.066 --> 38:39.626
- What's she saying?
- Something about a pig.

38:42.099 --> 38:44.091
May l be of assistance?

38:44.166 --> 38:45.758
Yes!

38:45.833 --> 38:48.324
We're looking for somebody
named Damon Bradley.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.836
Yes. Could you ask her
if she knows where we could find him?

39:00.500 --> 39:04.436
He thinks she's going to meet him
at Galeassi Ristorante...

39:04.500 --> 39:07.094
tonight at Piazza
Santa Maria Trastevere.

39:08.366 --> 39:11.096
But she has a prior commitment.

39:11.166 --> 39:12.633
Yes!

39:12.699 --> 39:15.032
Thank you.
That's all I needed to know.

39:15.099 --> 39:16.192
Thanks.

39:17.033 --> 39:19.467
You are looking for
a place to stay, no?

39:20.533 --> 39:22.160
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

39:22.233 --> 39:25.293
Perhaps I can help.
I am Giovanni.

39:25.366 --> 39:27.766
- And you are?
- Kate.

39:29.099 --> 39:31.796
I know a pensione. Bellissima.
And it's very close.

39:31.866 --> 39:33.163
- Really.
- Kate.

39:34.066 --> 39:35.260
- Let's go.
- faith.

39:35.333 --> 39:36.664
What?

39:38.166 --> 39:41.829
I'm tired. I'm hung over.
I haven't eaten or slept for two days.

39:41.900 --> 39:43.834
So back off.
I want a room.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.327
- You were saying?
- It's this beautiful pensione.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.334
I will take you there.
It's close.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.334
- Well, thank you.
- Yes.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.434
It's beautiful.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.934
It's like the Trevi fountain.

40:22.066 --> 40:25.001
Listen, Kate,
I must leave town for two days.

40:25.066 --> 40:28.331
I must go to my other shop in Milano.
It was unavoidable.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.426
But the day after tomorrow
I return...

40:31.500 --> 40:33.991
and I hope
you'll still be here.

41:16.333 --> 41:20.269
Faith, whatever happens tonight
you're gonna be okay.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.860
Why couldn't we just have
arranged marriages in America?

41:44.933 --> 41:48.869
Then you could spend your life blaming
your parents instead of yourself.

42:13.166 --> 42:16.533
Go on up there and ask the maitre 
if he's here. I'll wait.

42:16.599 --> 42:19.535
There he is. The maitre d'.
Go ask him. Go on.

42:19.599 --> 42:23.536
I will. I wanted to see
if maybe he'd notice me first.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.164
What?

42:26.233 --> 42:29.168
- I wanted to see if--
- Yeah, I heard you, Faith.

42:29.233 --> 42:33.329
You waited since you were a kid to meet
this guy. Don't play hard-to-get now.

42:40.500 --> 42:41.762
Could you go ask?

42:41.833 --> 42:43.323
Me?

42:45.266 --> 42:47.291
Oh, all right.
I'm going.

42:47.366 --> 42:49.664
I'm gonna go.
All right.

42:50.733 --> 42:52.360
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

43:08.533 --> 43:09.966
- Okay.
- He's here.

43:10.033 --> 43:11.523
- Him?
- Take it easy.

43:11.599 --> 43:13.465
He's right inside,
by the door.

43:13.533 --> 43:16.627
Right-hand side, back to us,
navy jacket.

43:17.699 --> 43:20.100
lf you turn around now...

43:20.166 --> 43:22.862
you can see part of his left elbow.

43:28.066 --> 43:30.159
Oh! I can see his sleeve!

43:31.000 --> 43:33.969
Very exciting. Progress.
This is good.

43:35.733 --> 43:38.668
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

43:38.733 --> 43:42.601
You've traveled 4,000 miles.
What's 15 more feet, right?

43:43.333 --> 43:44.766
This is it!

44:13.866 --> 44:15.493
Uh-oh.

44:22.599 --> 44:24.033
Sorry.

44:25.599 --> 44:27.431
Kate!

46:04.000 --> 46:06.662
What happened?
Are you okay?

46:07.733 --> 46:09.428
Where's your shoe?

46:09.500 --> 46:11.434
- I don't know.
- Okay, okay.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.933
Sit down.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.061
Everything's okay.

46:16.133 --> 46:19.466
- You can't say we didn't try, right?
- Right.

46:23.533 --> 46:25.660
- Here's what I think.
- What?

46:25.733 --> 46:28.998
We rent a truck or a car,
either one...

46:29.066 --> 46:33.002
we set up a loudspeaker,
drive through the surrounding areas...

46:33.066 --> 46:34.829
and page him.

46:37.733 --> 46:39.496
- Oh. How nice.
- Yes.

46:39.566 --> 46:41.261
Oh. Americans.
Allow me.

46:43.233 --> 46:44.666
Thank you.

46:45.933 --> 46:47.594
So, what do you think?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.934
It's kinda sweet, huh?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.468
I meant about my idea.

46:55.533 --> 46:59.936
Oh. Well, I think it's time
we got some professional help.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.094
- Like a detective.
- Like a psychiatrist.

47:03.166 --> 47:05.157
How's a psychiatrist
going to find him?

47:05.233 --> 47:06.700
Oh, dear.

47:07.766 --> 47:09.199
Thank you...

47:10.533 --> 47:11.966
very much.

47:14.066 --> 47:15.158
8-B?

47:15.233 --> 47:17.531
Yes. Exactly.
How'd you know?

47:17.599 --> 47:19.568
Well, it's my life.

47:19.633 --> 47:23.467
In the shoe biz, the foot is our naked
canvas. I could tell you some things.

47:23.533 --> 47:27.264
For instance, this is a Stephane Kelian
knockoff made in Jersey.

47:27.333 --> 47:29.267
I know the family.
Good quality control.

47:29.333 --> 47:32.769
It's impetuous, fun, elegant.

47:32.833 --> 47:34.767
Not much for cross-training.

47:34.833 --> 47:38.599
I hope it brings you to whatever it was
you were running after just now.

47:38.666 --> 47:40.600
Her destiny.

47:41.733 --> 47:44.668
Find your destiny.
Have you found it yet?

47:44.733 --> 47:47.998
Excuse me. I have to go buy a book
and look up every hotel in Rome.

47:48.066 --> 47:50.159
Okay. Excuse us.
I'm sorry.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.231
Is your friend okay?

47:52.300 --> 47:53.733
I don't know.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.132
She's looking for the man of her dreams.
He's around here someplace.

47:56.199 --> 47:59.533
She's never met him, never seen him.
If you consider that all right.

48:01.466 --> 48:05.129
Well, if she's never met him,
how does she know he's perfect for her?

48:05.199 --> 48:07.395
Oh, I don't know.

48:07.466 --> 48:09.730
- He's some kind of celebrity, right?
- No, no.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.734
Is he a hero, a mentor?

48:11.800 --> 48:14.860
No, she got his name
off a Ouija board when she was 11.

48:15.699 --> 48:17.224
Let's get to a phone.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.234
- Staying in Rome long?
- Taxi!

48:19.300 --> 48:22.531
I'd better come along. I speak Italian.
I have a friend at the embassy.

48:22.599 --> 48:25.535
- I'm gonna help you out. Okay?
- This is a personal matter.

48:25.599 --> 48:28.535
- What's his name? I'll look into it.
- It's nice of you to offer, but--

48:28.599 --> 48:30.431
Just tell me his name.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.933
Damon Bradley.

48:33.866 --> 48:35.629
I'm Damon Bradley.

48:35.699 --> 48:37.224
You're--

48:39.566 --> 48:41.363
What?

48:45.933 --> 48:48.868
Well, that's a first.
Uh, got a minute?

48:56.766 --> 48:59.997
- What were you going to say?
- No, what were you going to say?

49:00.066 --> 49:02.398
I don't know. I forget.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.496
- Are you too cold?
- No. I'm perfect.

49:06.566 --> 49:08.500
- Okay.
- It's perfect.

49:10.199 --> 49:11.531
- Are you?
- What?

49:11.599 --> 49:13.568
Too cool?
No, I'm fine.

49:27.900 --> 49:29.333
Thank you.

49:30.400 --> 49:31.867
That was a blessing.

49:31.933 --> 49:35.391
She gave us a blessing.
An Italian Gypsy blessing.

49:41.466 --> 49:44.401
- Isn't it amazing how--
- Isn't it amazing how--

49:44.466 --> 49:47.196
You're too pretty,
and I'm too nervous.

49:48.266 --> 49:49.699
What?
Don't pinch me.

49:49.766 --> 49:52.200
I want to see--
You are here.

49:52.266 --> 49:54.700
Yes, I'm here.
I'm very real.

49:56.699 --> 50:00.659
What am I trying to think of?
There's this poem by Goethe.

50:00.733 --> 50:02.030
Yeah, Goethe.

50:02.099 --> 50:04.534
It's about two people
who come from different places...

50:04.599 --> 50:06.534
but they hear
the same bird singing.

50:06.599 --> 50:09.933
''Perhaps the same bird
echoed through both of us yesterday...

50:10.000 --> 50:12.264
separate, in the evening.''

50:12.333 --> 50:14.062
That's it. Exactly.

50:15.133 --> 50:16.566
Wow.

50:19.033 --> 50:21.729
Yeah. It was Rilke.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.859
Rilke. Oh.

50:23.933 --> 50:26.265
Well, same country.
Right?

50:26.333 --> 50:27.994
How'd you know that?

50:28.066 --> 50:31.001
I could tell you some things.

51:04.633 --> 51:08.296
Some enchanted evening

51:09.866 --> 51:13.302
You may see a stranger

51:14.633 --> 51:17.033
You may see a stranger

51:17.099 --> 51:21.400
Across a crowded room

51:52.099 --> 51:54.034
I love trees.

51:55.300 --> 51:58.633
I could do nothing for the rest
of my life, just grow trees.

52:00.199 --> 52:03.260
The ancients believed that gods
dwelled in them. Did you know that?

52:05.400 --> 52:07.493
Maybe they're watching us now.

52:27.766 --> 52:30.030
- Do you know where you are?
- No.

52:31.266 --> 52:34.429
You're at La Bocca DelIa Verita.
Ooh.

52:36.266 --> 52:39.997
''The Mouth of Truth.''

52:41.566 --> 52:44.592
Gregory Peck.
Roman Holiday.

52:45.633 --> 52:47.658
Legend has it--

52:47.733 --> 52:50.827
That if you tell it a lie...

52:50.900 --> 52:53.334
and you put your hand in there--

52:53.400 --> 52:55.334
It will be bitten...

52:56.699 --> 52:58.258
off.

52:58.333 --> 53:02.099
And then Audrey Hepburn says,
''Oh, what a horrible idea.''

53:04.300 --> 53:08.066
Gregory Peck says,
''Let's see you do it.''

53:09.533 --> 53:11.262
Yes.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.865
Let's see you do it.

53:15.099 --> 53:18.365
let's do it together.

54:17.300 --> 54:19.768
I was born to kiss you.

54:24.833 --> 54:27.768
Oh, there's--

54:28.866 --> 54:31.562
Oh, God, there's--

54:34.699 --> 54:37.328
There's something
I have to tell you.

54:37.400 --> 54:40.665
There's nothing you could tell me
that would change how I feel about you.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.766
I'm engaged.

54:47.833 --> 54:50.859
We're supposed to be married
in nine days.

54:50.933 --> 54:53.766
Oh, whoa!
Except possibly that.

54:53.833 --> 54:56.529
Wait. What?

54:56.599 --> 54:59.296
- You're what?
- He's a friend of yours.

54:59.366 --> 55:02.358
- What?
- It's Dwayne.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.424
- Dwayne?
- That's how I knew you were here.

55:04.500 --> 55:08.368
It was me on the phone
from the airport.

55:08.433 --> 55:11.425
- I thought I'd never find you.
- l understand. I know.

55:13.066 --> 55:15.000
It's okay.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.497
I gotta--
I gotta call him.

55:20.566 --> 55:22.932
No, that's not
such a good idea.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.662
- Don't call him.
- I gotta call him.

55:25.733 --> 55:28.725
- Trust me.
- I gotta call him.

55:28.800 --> 55:31.633
- I gotta.
- Are you sure?

55:32.900 --> 55:35.835
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

55:37.966 --> 55:39.058
Wait.

55:39.133 --> 55:41.192
Oh, okay.

55:43.666 --> 55:46.191
- Want some more champagne?
- Mm-mm.

56:00.966 --> 56:04.265
- Can l use the phone?
- No, not really.

56:06.233 --> 56:08.633
Look.

56:08.699 --> 56:11.134
- I have a confession to make too.
- Yeah?

56:11.199 --> 56:13.293
Yeah.

56:13.366 --> 56:15.596
- You can tell me.
- Are you sure?

56:16.933 --> 56:20.425
Yeah.
We found each other, didn't we?

56:23.733 --> 56:27.635
So this is our destiny.
So you can tell me anything.

56:27.699 --> 56:29.793
Okay.

56:29.866 --> 56:32.835
Um, it's just that--

56:32.900 --> 56:35.801
- The thing is, I'm not exactly--
- Yeah?

56:35.866 --> 56:38.198
Only in the most literal sense...

56:38.266 --> 56:39.528
I'm not Damon Bradley.

56:40.599 --> 56:42.534
- What?
- My name's not Damon Bradley.

56:42.599 --> 56:45.194
- I just told you it was.
- What is it?

56:45.266 --> 56:47.700
It's Peter Wright.

56:50.099 --> 56:52.193
Obviously you're very upset.
That's natural. That's okay.

56:52.266 --> 56:54.393
I'm sorry!

56:54.466 --> 56:57.230
Everything else is true!
I'm from Boston. I'm single.

56:57.300 --> 57:00.497
I love trees. Mea culpa.
I lied about one little thing!

57:00.566 --> 57:03.034
Your identity is one little thing?

57:03.099 --> 57:06.035
- Get out of my way!
- You said you'd understand.

57:06.099 --> 57:08.933
That was before
I knew what it was!

57:10.266 --> 57:12.894
- Come on.
- Open.

57:12.966 --> 57:15.730
Let's calm down, okay?
let's put this in perspective.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.892
Jesus!

57:17.933 --> 57:20.959
I can't believe you're gonna let a few
letters of the alphabet keep us apart.

57:21.033 --> 57:22.967
It is a detail.

57:23.033 --> 57:25.729
- Call me Damon. It'll be a nickname.
- How could you do this to me?

57:25.800 --> 57:27.427
Because I'm in love with you!

57:28.400 --> 57:29.958
What kind of excuse is that?

57:31.733 --> 57:33.257
Sociopaths.

57:33.333 --> 57:36.029
They find out what you want them to be,
then they act that way.

57:36.099 --> 57:38.159
But how could he know?

57:38.233 --> 57:40.531
He only just met me.

57:40.599 --> 57:43.831
Men have ways.
That's all I know.

57:43.900 --> 57:45.333
Here.

57:51.400 --> 57:55.234
You know what my theory is?
Men should all get team jerseys.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.700
On the front,
they can write ''liars.''

57:57.766 --> 58:00.929
On the back, their name.
Their real one.

58:04.599 --> 58:06.898
Yeah.

58:10.133 --> 58:11.725
Look at me.

58:12.699 --> 58:14.531
I married a liar.

58:14.599 --> 58:18.092
Why?
'Cause I married a man.

58:38.733 --> 58:40.667
Here. Throw these in.

59:03.933 --> 59:07.460
So you're saying you think
I should call him, huh?

59:09.166 --> 59:11.760
- It's your husband, no?
- Yes.

59:12.833 --> 59:16.098
But he was having an affair.

59:18.366 --> 59:21.995
I don't think you understand.
He was sleeping with another woman.

59:25.766 --> 59:27.996
He was having sex
with another woman.

59:28.066 --> 59:29.624
Sex.

59:32.233 --> 59:35.225
She was your best friend, eh?

59:35.300 --> 59:37.894
- She wasn't my best friend.
- Your sister?

59:37.966 --> 59:40.457
No, of course not.

59:40.533 --> 59:42.763
His first wife?

59:42.833 --> 59:45.734
No one like that.
Not a friend, relative or anything.

59:45.800 --> 59:47.791
Just some woman I don't know.

59:47.866 --> 59:50.300
I've never met her or anything.

01:00:07.366 --> 01:00:10.392
Hey, Marty! Wait up!

01:00:10.466 --> 01:00:12.627
- You're going on the south side.
- I got it.

01:00:12.699 --> 01:00:14.895
Don't get up on that roof
till it stops raining.

01:00:14.966 --> 01:00:17.434
Should let up any minute now.

01:00:19.599 --> 01:00:21.761
Oh, damn. The phone.

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:28.600
Larry's Roofing.

01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:35.430
Kate?

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.525
Is that you?

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:40.501
Kate, where are you?

01:00:40.566 --> 01:00:43.091
Kate, are you all right?

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.933
Jesus!

01:01:12.933 --> 01:01:15.902
Yes. Could I get
the long-distance operator again?

01:01:15.966 --> 01:01:17.900
Forget it.

01:01:20.666 --> 01:01:22.793
Coming.

01:01:24.366 --> 01:01:26.300
- I just wanted... Is she here?
- No.

01:01:26.366 --> 01:01:29.130
- Oh, we've gotta talk.
- I was just on my way out.

01:01:29.199 --> 01:01:31.794
We can work this out.
Is she okay?

01:01:31.866 --> 01:01:35.097
She's fine. She went to get
our airline tickets home.

01:01:35.166 --> 01:01:37.964
Is this a genetic thing?
Men say anything just to get laid?

01:01:38.033 --> 01:01:40.661
Not fair.
A: I didn't get laid.

01:01:40.733 --> 01:01:44.066
B: The reality is, some metaphysical
wires got crossed somewhere.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:46.328
I don't have the right name,
but I am the guy.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.233
I was there. I know it.
Please, do not let her go.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.700
She's going, and she's
going to marry the podiatrist.

01:01:51.766 --> 01:01:54.166
- Podiatrist? That's deep.
- How could you lie to her like that?

01:01:54.233 --> 01:01:56.531
It was an emergency.
I literally had to.

01:01:56.599 --> 01:02:00.331
It was the only way to stop her.
If I didn't, I'd never see her again.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.460
- A lie's a lie.
- Please! Please?

01:02:03.533 --> 01:02:06.024
Will you sit down
for one second?

01:02:07.966 --> 01:02:10.560
Thank you.

01:02:12.533 --> 01:02:14.558
I am not supposed to be in Rome.

01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:18.160
I'm supposed to be in Boston,
leading a really boring life...

01:02:18.233 --> 01:02:22.761
working my can off for my boss
so he can spend half the day in the gym.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.425
But I'm here.

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.730
He was not supposed
to get measles.

01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:29.900
Measles at 43 years of age.

01:02:29.966 --> 01:02:32.799
But he did,
so they sent me--

01:02:32.866 --> 01:02:35.300
a guy who's never been anywhere
except maybe Mazatlán...

01:02:35.366 --> 01:02:37.300
for spring break.

01:02:37.366 --> 01:02:40.631
And someone gave me an Italian
phrase book the week before I left.

01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:43.464
I was not supposed to be
in the piazza that night...

01:02:43.533 --> 01:02:44.625
but I was.

01:02:44.699 --> 01:02:47.032
I went to see a movie,
but in my opinion...

01:02:47.099 --> 01:02:49.864
Woody Allen is not funny
when it's dubbed in Italian.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.925
So I left
and I was just wándering.

01:02:56.266 --> 01:02:58.928
And then someone bumped into me.

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:07.000
And then I saw her.
I looked into her eyes and--

01:03:07.066 --> 01:03:09.762
Wow, something happened
that's never happened to me before.

01:03:10.766 --> 01:03:14.930
- Something so familiar.
- Mania?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.959
Whatever. She fell in love
with me too, by the way.

01:03:19.033 --> 01:03:22.059
I said, ''Please, God, give me a sign,
some way of making sure...

01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:26.160
this woman does not get into that cab
and disappear from my life forever.

01:03:26.233 --> 01:03:28.997
She's the one.''

01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:31.591
And He did,
'cause she told me the name.

01:03:31.666 --> 01:03:34.692
It wasn't my name,
but it was a start.

01:03:34.766 --> 01:03:37.633
lf that's not destiny...

01:03:37.699 --> 01:03:40.430
then I don't know anything.

01:03:42.466 --> 01:03:44.400
That's really romantic.

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:49.300
- Is it a lie?
- Come on!

01:03:49.366 --> 01:03:51.960
It is a name, for Christ's sake.
This whole thing is ludicrous.

01:03:52.033 --> 01:03:55.196
You know she's out of her mind,
chasing some guy around.

01:03:55.266 --> 01:03:57.359
This guy, by the way,
could happen to be...

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.924
the biggest loser
on the face of the Earth.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.935
He could be a grump, a jerk,
a pervert, a cynic...

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.458
some guy whose mind is infested
with dark thoughts, a criminal.

01:04:07.699 --> 01:04:09.634
He could be...

01:04:09.699 --> 01:04:11.634
truly sick.

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:15.327
Realistically,
what are the odds...

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.029
that he's some extra-super,
double-terrific guy?

01:04:21.199 --> 01:04:23.828
- Ten billion to one.
- Exactly!

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.834
Do I have an ally?

01:04:27.266 --> 01:04:27.266
I have returned.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.961
I have returned.

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:32.730
Faith's friend, Peter.
Giovanni. Hi.

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:37.501
I thought we could see Roma today,
but if you are busy--

01:04:37.566 --> 01:04:40.433
No! Faith's friend.
let's go.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.933
Good.

01:04:50.633 --> 01:04:53.727
And my husband Larry,
he's a roofer.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.768
Roofing contractor, actually.

01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:58.767
I mean, thank you.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.868
Before that,
when he was younger, he painted.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:04.992
Not houses but pictures.

01:05:05.066 --> 01:05:07.296
Yeah. But...

01:05:07.366 --> 01:05:10.096
you can't raise a family
on paintings.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:16.199
I guess you have to
go back to work now, huh?

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:19.064
Oh, no. It's siesta.

01:05:19.133 --> 01:05:20.395
Oh.

01:05:20.466 --> 01:05:23.799
You see, at home only the kids
take naps in the afternoon.

01:05:23.866 --> 01:05:25.925
Adults go straight through.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.401
Me, I don't even lie down
at all...

01:05:29.466 --> 01:05:31.195
during the day.

01:05:31.266 --> 01:05:34.167
Yes. In America,
you care for work.

01:05:34.233 --> 01:05:36.201
You live to work.
You stop for nothing.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.693
But in Italy...

01:05:38.766 --> 01:05:41.860
we care for food,
for pleasure...

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.234
for love.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:49.634
- Biscuit?
- Yes.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.262
It's crunchy.

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:12.367
Mm, thank you.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:45.632
I was able to get us out
on the first flight tomorrow morning.

01:06:45.699 --> 01:06:47.759
8:00 a.m.

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:50.063
8:00 a.m.?

01:06:50.133 --> 01:06:53.432
- So soon?
- The sooner the better.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.936
You were right about this whole thing
from the beginning.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.935
Stupid. Chasing a name.

01:07:04.866 --> 01:07:07.858
- I had to try.
- What about Peter?

01:07:09.099 --> 01:07:11.261
- Peter?
- Yeah.

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:13.597
- Peter was a mistake.
- I don't know.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.491
Thought he was kinda fun, huh?

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:19.262
He was eccentric at best...

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:20.857
and not in a good way.

01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:23.458
- You mean, like your way?
- Yeah.

01:07:23.533 --> 01:07:25.558
No. Very funny.

01:07:35.766 --> 01:07:36.858
What?

01:07:36.933 --> 01:07:39.094
You're crazy about him.

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:40.599
I am not.

01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:42.190
You are too.

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:44.097
I hate him.

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:48.398
That's a strong response for someone
you said you didn't even like.

01:07:48.466 --> 01:07:51.299
I hated what he did.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:55.063
Good, 'cause that's what I told him
when he dropped off the flowers.

01:07:55.133 --> 01:07:57.897
You told him
that I hated him?

01:07:57.966 --> 01:08:00.196
Can't stand him, huh?

01:08:07.966 --> 01:08:11.265
Hey, Katarina.
La bella Italia, she's waiting.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:13.961
- Let's go.
- I'll be right down.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:19.897
You better start packing.
Our cab's coming at the crack of dawn.

01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:22.264
He promised to take me
on a tour of the fountains.

01:08:24.133 --> 01:08:26.624
But I'll stay.

01:08:26.698 --> 01:08:28.930
I'm not gonna go.
If you want me to stay, I'll stay.

01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:35.969
He knows I'm married.
I'll be back before dawn.

01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:45.024
The 16th century
exalted the human tigure.

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.536
It was their way
of glorifying the human spirit.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.796
But it's an ancient preoccupation.

01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:54.232
You see, the female body...

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:57.462
has always been the essence...

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.434
the mystery of human life.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.435
So someday I'll visit you
in Pittsburgh...

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.435
and you'll show me
all her beauties, hmm?

01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:43.928
Oh, Marcello.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.698
I'll need a taxi tomorrow morning
at 6:30 to go to the airport.

01:09:48.765 --> 01:09:51.326
- Okay. Thank you.
- Ah, Signorina Faith.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:54.597
- Yes?
- Peter Wright left messages for you.

01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:58.124
- He calls all the time.
- No phone calls for me.

01:09:58.199 --> 01:10:00.930
Thank you. Ow!

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:05.897
You stubbed your toe.

01:10:05.966 --> 01:10:07.900
I know I stubbed my toe.

01:10:09.066 --> 01:10:10.556
Well?

01:10:10.633 --> 01:10:13.431
- Go away.
- Don't you think that's a sign?

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.866
- Oh! A sign.
- It's obvious.

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:18.834
He's a foot doctor, pain is your body's
way to tell you something's wrong.

01:10:18.899 --> 01:10:21.027
Your toe's trying to tell you
not to marry Dwayne.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.228
My toe is telling me
I've been hurt by a shoe salesman.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.394
- What about last night?
- What about, you're a liar?

01:10:27.466 --> 01:10:30.128
- What about ''I was born to kiss you''?
- What about--

01:10:30.199 --> 01:10:33.533
Oon't you have to work?
Maybe you're not a shoe salesman.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.398
The truth is, you came here looking
for something and you found it.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:38.661
It's right in back of you.
You're frightened.

01:10:38.733 --> 01:10:41.930
That's understandable.
I couldn't even sleep last night.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.594
Peter, stop.

01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:46.657
Last night was an illusion.

01:10:46.733 --> 01:10:50.965
You weren't who you said you were,
so I wasn't who I thought I was...

01:10:51.033 --> 01:10:53.365
so neither of us were there.

01:10:53.433 --> 01:10:56.402
It wasn't real.
It didn't happen.

01:10:56.466 --> 01:10:57.763
I don't know you.

01:10:57.833 --> 01:10:59.425
Get to know me.

01:11:00.566 --> 01:11:02.500
- We're not supposed to be.
- Yes, we are.

01:11:02.566 --> 01:11:05.262
Don't throw your life away
on someone you don't love.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:07.528
Who says I don't love him?

01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:13.134
Uh, all right.

01:11:14.366 --> 01:11:18.200
Go home and marry your podiatrist.

01:11:19.533 --> 01:11:22.093
I hope you'll be
very happy together.

01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:07.067
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:08.899 --> 01:12:11.198
Oh, okay. All right.

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.090
Faith !

01:12:24.899 --> 01:12:26.868
Wait, wait!

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.034
You can't go.

01:12:32.066 --> 01:12:35.934
- Why can't I go?
- Because I found him.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.092
Stop the car.

01:12:38.633 --> 01:12:40.533
Whoa! I'm okay.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.569
I couldn't sleep last night.
For some reason, I was a wreck.

01:12:43.633 --> 01:12:46.864
So what did I do? I went
to that restaurant, La Galeassi.

01:12:46.933 --> 01:12:49.527
You want me to take that for you?
I had a chocolate gelato.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.068
I talked to the waiter
asked him a couple of ques! tions.

01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:56.399
Turns out-- I'll get it--
He knew the name of Damon's hotel.

01:12:56.466 --> 01:12:58.764
- You're kidding.
- No, it's right.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.996
I call the hotel.
They say, ''No, he left yesterday.''

01:13:02.066 --> 01:13:05.433
But apparently he comes here every year
and always follows the same route.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.060
He always goes from Rome
down the coast...

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:11.296
to La Sirenuse Hotel
in Positano.

01:13:11.366 --> 01:13:13.664
- Where's Positano?
- Three hours south.

01:13:13.733 --> 01:13:16.429
- Did I do the right thing?
- Great! We can call Giovanni.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.365
- What? It's perfect.
- He can drive us.

01:13:18.433 --> 01:13:21.129
- We can all go down together.
- It's really perfect.

01:13:21.199 --> 01:13:23.191
I did the right thing.
She won't say it.

01:13:23.266 --> 01:13:24.699
You did.

01:13:49.466 --> 01:13:53.095
You know what I think?
Anything can happen here.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.069
Kate, look down there.
Magnifico.

01:14:12.133 --> 01:14:14.067
Oh, God.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.934
Oh. Is it over?

01:14:49.199 --> 01:14:51.134
Where's the guy
with the checkered flag?

01:14:53.933 --> 01:14:55.867
Okay, Faith. Hold on.

01:14:58.733 --> 01:15:01.395
Oh, my God.
Faith, Joan Collins stayed here.

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:29.770
Well, right now
he's by the pooI.

01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:32.427
He says he wears
a gold medallion.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.765
- Want to check out the pool?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:42.026
Let's go. This way.

01:15:49.666 --> 01:15:52.601
Oh, look at this.
Isn't this beautiful?

01:15:58.233 --> 01:16:00.963
I hate men
that wear jewelry.

01:16:29.966 --> 01:16:32.526
That's Damon Bradley?

01:16:40.633 --> 01:16:43.067
Aren't you going to
introduce yourself?

01:16:43.133 --> 01:16:44.225
Of course.

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.893
- Do you want me to do it?
- No.

01:16:48.966 --> 01:16:50.900
Good luck.

01:17:14.533 --> 01:17:16.467
You're in my sun.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.295
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:24.898
- I thought I...
- Damon!

01:17:24.966 --> 01:17:27.799
I'll see you tomorrow.
Ciao.

01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:30.928
Ciao, Amanda.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.432
- Damon?
- Uh-huh.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.025
- Damon Bradley?
- That's me.

01:18:06.899 --> 01:18:09.391
Beautiful place.

01:18:11.366 --> 01:18:14.062
You know, it sure is.

01:18:14.133 --> 01:18:15.566
Yeah.

01:18:21.566 --> 01:18:24.262
Been here long?

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.062
Since yesterday.

01:18:26.133 --> 01:18:28.226
I just got here too.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.894
Not yesterday.
Just now. Just today.

01:18:30.966 --> 01:18:34.094
With my sister-in-law,
my brother's wife.

01:18:34.166 --> 01:18:36.259
Wife. Yes.

01:18:38.033 --> 01:18:42.094
- I'm sure I'll see you around.
- Oh, I hope so.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.331
You know...

01:18:46.399 --> 01:18:48.334
I was wondering.

01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:53.259
Do you have dinner plans?

01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:55.460
Not exactly.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.198
Would you be willing
to have dinner with me?

01:19:02.899 --> 01:19:04.731
Sure.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.563
Really?

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.431
Where?

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.401
There's a restaurant
at the bottom of the steps.

01:19:15.466 --> 01:19:18.924
It's called
Il Covo del Sara-something.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.968
It's great. $:30?

01:19:21.033 --> 01:19:22.967
- Sounds good?
- Covo del Something.

01:19:23.033 --> 01:19:26.002
I'll see you at 8:30
at the bottom--

01:19:27.566 --> 01:19:30.296
- Watch your step. You okay?
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

01:19:30.366 --> 01:19:34.302
- I'll see you there.
- What's your name?

01:19:34.366 --> 01:19:36.300
Oh, Faith.

01:19:36.366 --> 01:19:39.233
My name is Faith.

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:41.268
Smooth.

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:43.267
Very smooth.

01:19:45.733 --> 01:19:49.260
Corvatch.
C-O-R-V-A-T-C-H.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.093
That's right. Yeah.

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:55.431
My wife used her card yesterday
and I can't remember the amount.

01:19:57.199 --> 01:20:01.068
No, I can't wait for the statement.
That's why I'm calling you.

01:20:01.133 --> 01:20:05.627
All right. Hey, Pete!
Tell Roy to send up more shingles.

01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:09.101
Hey, Roy!
He wants some more shingles!

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:15.997
Four hundred dollars
from the La Sirenuse Hotel in Positano?

01:20:16.066 --> 01:20:19.160
Where is Positano,
in Mexico?

01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:23.101
Italy?
My wife's in Italy?

01:20:23.166 --> 01:20:26.829
What the helI's she doing in Italy?
She's only been gone 48 hours.

01:20:26.899 --> 01:20:30.597
Huh? I'm sorry, ma'am.
Have a nice day then.

01:20:33.566 --> 01:20:35.500
My wife's in Italy.

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:39.368
What the helI's
she doing in Italy?

01:20:39.433 --> 01:20:41.264
Who's in Italy?

01:20:41.333 --> 01:20:43.028
Fellas, I gotta get out of here.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.762
You finish up this job here.

01:20:45.833 --> 01:20:47.960
Don't have too many beers
at lunch.

01:20:48.033 --> 01:20:51.434
- Yeah, okay.
- Make sure you quit by 4:00.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:54.060
Whoa!
All right. I'm fine.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:59.091
Have you seen this sunset
out here?

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:04.932
Larry would love these rooftops,
you know?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.094
Did you see his eyes?

01:21:08.166 --> 01:21:13.194
They were beautiful.
Brown, with little flecks of green.

01:21:13.266 --> 01:21:15.860
Wasn't he nice?
He's really nice.

01:21:16.933 --> 01:21:20.528
How old do you think Giovanni is?
No more than 40?

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:22.534
Come in!

01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:32.396
The stars will be iealous
of you tonight.

01:21:32.466 --> 01:21:34.229
You are a vision.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:39.233
Thanks. You certainly
know how to talk.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.263
By the way, l invite you all
on your last evening in Italy.

01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:53.563
A friend of mine has a yacht.
You can see it from the balcony.

01:21:53.633 --> 01:21:56.261
I told him I would bring
all my American friends tonight.

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.460
So you must all come, hmm?

01:21:58.533 --> 01:22:01.764
Yeah, we'd love that.
Faith, you in?

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:04.301
Okay. Ciao. Have fun.

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.562
I'm sorry.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:13.194
In another life or parallel universe,
we would have loved that. Better?

01:22:13.266 --> 01:22:15.757
- I have to get ready.
- Okay. Sorry.

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.764
Wait, wait. Sorry.

01:22:20.133 --> 01:22:21.862
- Here.
- What is it?

01:22:21.933 --> 01:22:23.867
You'll see.

01:22:26.133 --> 01:22:28.863
- Shoes!
- Yeah.

01:22:28.933 --> 01:22:32.664
They're bone, a good color
for a date with destiny.

01:22:32.733 --> 01:22:35.600
It should be-- Don't worry
about those European sizes.

01:22:35.666 --> 01:22:38.226
It's perfect.
It should tit like a glove.

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.962
- They do.
- Yeah?

01:22:41.033 --> 01:22:42.466
Good.

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:50.601
Could you hand me my dress?
It's over on the window--

01:22:57.466 --> 01:23:00.230
And my earrings?
Those little moon ones?

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.530
Yeah.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:05.592
And could you get me
my little ankle--

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.233
Thanks.

01:23:31.666 --> 01:23:35.329
Oh, you got the pictures back
from the place.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.934
This one of us is great.
Did you see that picture that...

01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:53.463
Oh, God.

01:23:58.399 --> 01:24:01.096
Oh, you look great.

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:04.600
Thank you.

01:24:12.899 --> 01:24:17.769
I just... I want to thank you
for making all of this possible.

01:24:17.833 --> 01:24:20.063
Sure.
It's th e l east I couId do.

01:24:20.133 --> 01:24:23.159
I just hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.092
Stop.

01:24:38.166 --> 01:24:40.691
Oh, Peter, stop.

01:24:40.766 --> 01:24:43.428
No matter what happens tonight,
I love you.

01:24:44.699 --> 01:24:47.430
- I have to go.
- Yeah.

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.628
It's pumpkin time.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.433
Oh!

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:21.833
Wow. You look just like a goddess.

01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:26.064
You really do.
I mean, it's... Whoa.

01:25:26.133 --> 01:25:27.395
A lot of steps.

01:25:47.966 --> 01:25:50.400
- Want some wine?
- Yes.

01:25:50.466 --> 01:25:53.026
Do you have a good house red?

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.533
Cool.

01:25:56.666 --> 01:26:00.295
Now, I know you're gonna think
this sounds crazy...

01:26:00.366 --> 01:26:04.029
but I noticed you at the pool
even before we spoke.

01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:07.764
I could sense
a chemistry between us.

01:26:09.233 --> 01:26:12.430
- Really?
- Truly.

01:26:43.466 --> 01:26:45.730
So...

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.792
you're probably wondering
why I asked you to dinner.

01:26:49.766 --> 01:26:53.600
No, not really.
It happens all the time.

01:26:56.733 --> 01:26:59.031
Right.

01:27:00.166 --> 01:27:02.100
What looks good?

01:27:03.366 --> 01:27:05.459
I think I'm gonna have the scampi.

01:27:05.533 --> 01:27:08.297
Oh, you like shrimp?
I like shrimp.

01:27:08.366 --> 01:27:11.096
Get out of town.
Come on.

01:27:11.166 --> 01:27:13.100
Put her there.

01:27:40.333 --> 01:27:43.268
0o you believe in destiny?

01:28:04.033 --> 01:28:05.967
It is written...

01:28:07.166 --> 01:28:08.428
on the stars.

01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:56.769
My son Kyle is in the third grade.
He's really the smart one.

01:28:56.833 --> 01:28:58.824
My other son is very...

01:28:58.899 --> 01:29:02.666
physical, I guess,
would be the term.

01:29:02.733 --> 01:29:05.861
You think I'm just
one of those men...

01:29:05.933 --> 01:29:09.061
who tries to seduce
every woman he meets.

01:29:09.133 --> 01:29:11.601
Oh, I know that's what you are.

01:29:13.366 --> 01:29:15.300
Does it matter?

01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:28.357
I've told you all about me.

01:29:28.433 --> 01:29:31.095
- I want to hear about you.
- All right.

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:34.966
What kind of books do you like?
What music do you listen to?

01:29:35.033 --> 01:29:38.730
I like action films.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.167
I like Van Damme movies.

01:29:42.233 --> 01:29:45.293
I love martial art films.

01:30:01.399 --> 01:30:03.891
Really?
You don't like opera?

01:30:03.966 --> 01:30:05.627
I'm surprised to hear that.

01:30:09.699 --> 01:30:12.669
- Giovanni, I'm sorry.
- What?

01:30:12.733 --> 01:30:15.429
You're very kind and gentle,
and I'll never forget you...

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:17.934
but I can't do this.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.092
I'm married.

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.534
- That makes me uncomfortable.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.966
- How bout that?
- Come on. Stop it.

01:30:33.033 --> 01:30:35.661
- Is this what you want?
- I said stop!

01:30:35.733 --> 01:30:37.792
- Okay.
- Stop it.

01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:47.295
I'll kill you!

01:30:47.366 --> 01:30:49.334
- You crossed the line, you jerk!
- You crossed the line.

01:30:49.399 --> 01:30:52.631
- You blew it from the get-go!
- I did you a favor.

01:30:52.699 --> 01:30:54.463
I said to turn her off
not molest her!

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:57.024
I was improvising.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.561
Are you not Damon Bradley?

01:31:04.466 --> 01:31:07.560
No, I am not Damon Bradley.

01:31:07.633 --> 01:31:10.966
Look, I'm real...
Damn it!

01:31:12.199 --> 01:31:14.691
I'm really sorry.
You're very sweet.

01:31:14.766 --> 01:31:16.791
- I'm sorry it went this far.
- Shut up, Harry! You've done enough!

01:31:16.866 --> 01:31:20.233
- You shut up.
- So you're probably really upset.

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.700
- Just be a little bit rational.
- Rational!

01:31:23.733 --> 01:31:26.429
Hit him!

01:31:26.500 --> 01:31:28.764
- Let it out.
- Stop it!

01:31:31.433 --> 01:31:34.800
Okay, what's with
the bald guy, huh?

01:31:34.866 --> 01:31:37.699
- Faith, I can explain!
- Great.

01:31:37.766 --> 01:31:39.529
Okay, slow down.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.033
Oh, God.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.034
Oh, dear. Oh, my.

01:31:45.466 --> 01:31:48.594
Faith, I was afraid
of losing you!

01:31:48.666 --> 01:31:50.031
Let's go.

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:53.194
You are so ungrateful. Do you know
what kind of planning this took?

01:31:53.266 --> 01:31:57.100
This was a maior production.
I did it all for us!

01:31:57.166 --> 01:32:00.431
Thank you very much.
I hope you're very happy!

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:03.094
I don't believe in anything anymore!

01:32:03.166 --> 01:32:06.067
I don't believe in the moon or stars
or the sun or destiny...

01:32:06.133 --> 01:32:08.397
or magic or men!

01:32:08.466 --> 01:32:12.562
Why won't you accept the fact that
I'll do anything to keep us together?

01:32:12.633 --> 01:32:14.567
You've outdone yourself!

01:32:15.933 --> 01:32:18.265
You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone.

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:21.700
You're nuts about me!
We're made for each other!

01:32:32.899 --> 01:32:35.198
Haven't they ever heard
of escalators?

01:32:43.766 --> 01:32:47.497
You didn't mean what you said about not
believing in the stars and the moon?

01:32:47.566 --> 01:32:49.500
- You?
- I...

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:54.067
I can't.

01:32:55.233 --> 01:32:57.167
I can't now.

01:32:59.133 --> 01:33:02.534
I'm sorry for dragging you here.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.501
No, don't say you're sorry...

01:33:05.566 --> 01:33:09.195
'cause this has been the best weekend
of my entire life.

01:33:15.699 --> 01:33:19.602
I guess sometimes life just doesn't
turn out the way we imagined it.

01:33:25.699 --> 01:33:27.634
Look at the stars.

01:33:27.699 --> 01:33:30.430
They come out every night.

01:33:32.066 --> 01:33:34.933
ro almost love a woman
and then lose her.

01:33:38.133 --> 01:33:40.067
Enjoy the pain.

01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:45.602
It's like losing at roulette.
There's that sweet sting.

01:33:50.699 --> 01:33:52.634
Oh, Jesus, Harry.

01:33:56.166 --> 01:33:58.100
There's only one woman...

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:01.167
and she's gone.

01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:12.793
Are you all right?

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.859
- Yes.
- Can I get you something?

01:34:15.933 --> 01:34:18.128
No, thank you.

01:34:18.199 --> 01:34:21.931
I just would like you
to send this very quickly.

01:34:23.233 --> 01:34:25.098
Yes.

01:34:30.066 --> 01:34:33.558
I'm calling off my wedding.

01:34:36.833 --> 01:34:38.562
Sorry.

01:34:46.966 --> 01:34:49.093
I'll send it immediately.

01:34:55.533 --> 01:34:56.966
Thanks.

01:35:15.266 --> 01:35:16.733
Just go.

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:40.593
I'm sorry.

01:35:40.666 --> 01:35:42.793
I wanna...

01:35:42.866 --> 01:35:44.800
Come on. Let's go.

01:36:06.866 --> 01:36:09.300
Larry?
What are you doin' here?

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.730
What am I doin' here?
What the hell are you doin' here?

01:36:16.766 --> 01:36:19.360
You came all the way here
just to ask me that?

01:36:21.233 --> 01:36:23.497
No, I...

01:36:23.566 --> 01:36:26.694
I came all the way here
to tell you...

01:36:26.766 --> 01:36:28.256
I love you and l...

01:36:29.399 --> 01:36:30.731
miss you.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:35.360
I've been miserable
without you, Katy.

01:36:35.433 --> 01:36:38.095
Oh, Larry, I've missed you too.

01:36:46.833 --> 01:36:48.300
You're gonna be okay?

01:36:48.366 --> 01:36:51.529
I'm gonna be okay.
I want you guys to have a great time.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.397
- Did you call Mom?
- Yeah.

01:36:53.466 --> 01:36:55.263
- 0id you calI Dwayne?
- Yeah.

01:36:55.333 --> 01:36:57.358
What'd they say?
What?

01:36:57.433 --> 01:36:59.833
Everybody is worried about you,
you understand?

01:36:59.899 --> 01:37:02.596
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- You got everything?

01:37:05.666 --> 01:37:08.191
Listen, what time is your flight?

01:37:08.266 --> 01:37:10.826
- You got your passport?
- Yeah.

01:37:10.899 --> 01:37:12.094
Your ticket?

01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.927
I'm Damon Bradley.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.400
You're Damon Bradley?

01:37:48.466 --> 01:37:50.934
I mean, off the Ouija board,
when we were kids.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.298
I made the whole thing up.
I was pushing the arrow.

01:37:53.366 --> 01:37:56.130
- I wanted to get to the next question.
- You made the whole thing up?

01:37:56.199 --> 01:37:59.863
- Damon Bradley never existed?
- He was a kid in Little League.

01:37:59.933 --> 01:38:02.424
- He was a real jerk.
- What about the fortune teller?

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.798
- That fat gypsy woman?
- Don't say that.

01:38:04.866 --> 01:38:07.426
I slipped her two bucks.
The whole thing was a joke.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.469
Larry, this is bad.
You have to tell Faith.

01:38:10.533 --> 01:38:12.694
I am not going to tell Faith.
She'll never speak to me again.

01:38:12.766 --> 01:38:15.599
- She called off her whole wedding.
- Because she's in love.

01:38:15.666 --> 01:38:18.692
Why would she call off her wedding
if she was in love?

01:38:18.766 --> 01:38:20.631
Because it's not Dwayne.

01:38:20.699 --> 01:38:25.034
What do you mean?
Then who is she in love with?

01:38:29.133 --> 01:38:31.067
- Spanish?
- How'd you know that?

01:38:31.133 --> 01:38:33.829
It's very nice suede.
How much you pay for them?

01:38:33.899 --> 01:38:36.664
87.50, American.

01:38:36.733 --> 01:38:38.928
- Wow. Could've done better.
- Better?

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.865
I'll give you a card.

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:08.393
Passengers on TWA flight
to New York...

01:39:08.466 --> 01:39:11.264
prepare to board
at gate number ten.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.764
Alitalia nonstop flight
to Boston...

01:39:19.833 --> 01:39:22.859
is now boarding
at gate number 40.

01:39:24.666 --> 01:39:28.898
Mr. Damon Bradley, please come
to the information desk.

01:39:35.833 --> 01:39:38.461
I'll be in touch.

01:39:41.033 --> 01:39:42.967
Excuse me.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.268
Excuse me.

01:39:54.466 --> 01:39:56.593
- I'm Damon Bradley.
- Oh, yes.

01:39:56.666 --> 01:39:59.464
- You have a message for me?
- Yes, I have a message.

01:39:59.533 --> 01:40:03.128
Mademoiselle Plantard will meet you
directly at your hotel in Geneva.

01:40:03.199 --> 01:40:05.600
Ah, thank you very much.

01:40:19.399 --> 01:40:21.095
Shall we?

01:40:28.533 --> 01:40:30.228
I'm Peter. This is Faith.

01:40:31.866 --> 01:40:35.802
We're a bit strange. She's been
Iooking for you her whole life.

01:40:35.866 --> 01:40:38.061
Basically.

01:40:38.133 --> 01:40:42.297
As a matter of fact,
she thinks she wants to marry you.

01:40:42.366 --> 01:40:45.130
Yeah.
Are you married?

01:40:45.199 --> 01:40:47.600
- No.
- Oh, good. Whew.

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:50.260
- Do you have a good job?
- Of course.

01:40:50.333 --> 01:40:52.324
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry. Peter, Faith.

01:40:52.399 --> 01:40:54.925
We're just friends.
He's available.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.695
This is good.

01:40:56.766 --> 01:40:59.234
She thinks that you two
are meant to be.

01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:01.234
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.700
The only problem is me,
because I'm in love with her.

01:41:05.033 --> 01:41:07.467
I love her more
than she'll ever know.

01:41:07.533 --> 01:41:08.966
But...

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:14.263
You're a lucky man.
You've got the right name.

01:41:19.399 --> 01:41:22.062
Good-bye, Faith.

01:41:22.133 --> 01:41:24.294
I hope you work it out.

01:41:26.833 --> 01:41:28.266
Hope we work what out?

01:41:34.399 --> 01:41:36.334
What's going on?

01:41:37.966 --> 01:41:39.263
He loves me.

01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:42.234
I can see that.

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:44.495
The question is: Do you love him?

01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:46.792
What?

01:41:46.866 --> 01:41:49.198
I said, the question is:
Do you love him?

01:41:49.266 --> 01:41:51.530
What?

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.364
0o you love him?

01:41:55.866 --> 01:41:59.267
- Last call for boarding.
- I do.

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.927
I do.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.192
Good.

01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:16.095
I have a plane to Geneva
to catch...

01:42:16.166 --> 01:42:20.227
and you have a plane to catch.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.299
Is this the flight to Boston?
I have to get on that flight.

01:42:32.366 --> 01:42:34.891
- The flight is closed.
- Excuse me?

01:42:34.966 --> 01:42:38.299
You don't understand.
The man I love is on that plane.

01:42:38.366 --> 01:42:41.164
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

01:42:41.233 --> 01:42:44.100
Please, can you help me?
You understand.

01:42:44.166 --> 01:42:45.963
Don't you?

01:42:47.833 --> 01:42:50.768
Do you got a ticket?
This is to New York.

01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.592
Okay.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.525
Oh, my God!

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:44.400
Thank you!

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.534
Good luck!
