You're wondering
if I want something for myself.

22:54.765 --> 22:57.357
I was raised with nothing.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.617
Nothing.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.528

your guilt to good use...

about Mama, but she didn't miss

That's what Luke said.

28:10.431 --> 28:12.931
And besides, this whole
industry is built on lies.

28:13.083 --> 28:15.267
You remember that photo shoot
I did for<i> Beaucoups</i> magazine?

28:15.419 --> 28:17.436
-Mm-hmm.
-They airbrushed me so hard

28:17.588 --> 28:19.604
my waist was about
as big around as your neck.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.032
-How dare they.
-I know.

28:22.184 --> 28:23.275
I was excited to do the shoot

28:23.427 --> 28:25.018
'cause I wanted to show
the world who I am,

28:25.112 --> 28:27.279
not buy into that
unattainable beauty crap

28:27.431 --> 28:29.522
they've been selling
my whole life.

28:29.691 --> 28:31.450
Well, screw<i> Beaucoups</i> magazine.

28:31.602 --> 28:34.461
Show the world who you are.
Show them your truth.

28:35.789 --> 28:37.464
Yeah.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.616
Hi, y'all. Um, I wanted
to clear something up.

28:47.709 --> 28:50.786
You may see some pictures of me
where I look like I weigh

28:50.804 --> 28:55.123
about a buck ten with no pores
and have a mane like a lion.

28:55.142 --> 28:58.235
But that girl, bless her
little airbrushed heart,

28:58.386 --> 29:00.796
she is not me or anybody real.

29:00.889 --> 29:02.722
So, thank God.

29:02.816 --> 29:04.557
This is me.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.411
I'm gonna show you
what my day is really like.

29:07.562 --> 29:09.988
(alarm beeping)

29:10.140 --> 29:12.657
So, this is what I look like
when I wake up.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.401
Uh, bed head, bad breath.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.661
Lovely.

29:16.814 --> 29:18.756
-(Summer crying)
-Then I change dirty diapers.

29:18.907 --> 29:20.999
Luckily, you can't smell that.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.667
Later on, I'll have some lunch.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.169
Not that you can tell
from those pictures,

29:24.321 --> 29:25.429
but the real Gigi actually eats.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.823
Usually, whatever
my daughter doesn't finish.

29:27.841 --> 29:31.510
So today it is
cold grilled cheese.

29:31.662 --> 29:33.178
Yummy.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.663
Mmm.

29:34.832 --> 29:37.257
Then I go to work, because
some people have to do that.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.184
After which I'll go home
and wash that pan

29:39.278 --> 29:40.778
I made the grilled cheese in.

29:40.929 --> 29:42.838
Because real people
do the dishes.

29:42.931 --> 29:45.115
So listen up, if you happen
to see that picture of me

29:45.267 --> 29:47.284
with the fake wind
blowing my fake hair

29:47.511 --> 29:49.027
as I bat my fake eyelashes,

29:49.179 --> 29:51.789
just know that's not me
or any other real woman.

29:51.940 --> 29:54.274
You don't need to look like
a Barbie doll to be beautiful,

29:54.368 --> 29:55.867

29:55.961 --> 29:58.444

it's their loss.

33:51.221 --> 33:53.438
I know who I am.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.532
And I'm done pretending
to be anybody else.

33:55.759 --> 33:57.159
Cheers to that.

33:59.596 --> 34:01.429
Hey. Thank you.

34:01.448 --> 34:03.598
We just secured
worldwide distribution.

34:03.617 --> 34:06.209
In no small part thanks to you
blowing the roof off the place.

34:06.361 --> 34:08.953
I mean it, Nick.
You killed it tonight.

34:09.048 --> 34:10.964
I'm sensing a "but."

34:12.776 --> 34:15.960
-Mackenzie Gates didn't show.
-Okay, so all that pretending,

34:16.055 --> 34:19.114
as you put, um,
that was for nothing.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.298
No, it wasn't for nothing.

34:20.450 --> 34:21.558
Oh, yeah, 'cause
I'm forgetting about

34:21.709 --> 34:23.451
the silver lining
that now my daughter hates me.

34:23.470 --> 34:25.545
We just have to show
Open Horizon

34:25.564 --> 34:28.306
what every other person
here saw tonight, okay?

34:28.458 --> 34:30.067
That you deserve a tour.

34:30.218 --> 34:32.235
I'm gonna get you one.

34:32.462 --> 34:33.737
I promise.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.075
Hey.

34:38.302 --> 34:39.467
How you doing, kiddo?

34:39.561 --> 34:41.912
I don't know how everyone
is just celebrating

34:42.063 --> 34:44.247
like nothing's going on.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.899
What if my dad needs help?

34:46.919 --> 34:49.669
The police are doing
everything they can.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.665
Now, can I be honest with you?

34:53.759 --> 34:57.052
I think you're old enough
to hear this straight.

34:59.747 --> 35:04.326
I think your dad needed a break,
and he just took one.

35:04.419 --> 35:07.086
Sorry, but he wouldn't do that.

35:07.164 --> 35:09.347
And I'm sick of every time
that I bring it up,

35:09.441 --> 35:11.090
everyone seems like
there's something

35:11.110 --> 35:13.193
that they just,
they can't tell me.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.947
Excuse me.

35:17.098 --> 35:20.008
Hey, little girl.

35:20.026 --> 35:23.862
-(exhales)
-What was that about?

35:24.014 --> 35:26.181
That was about
Nicky's little girl

35:26.199 --> 35:28.850
really missing her daddy.

35:28.869 --> 35:31.795
Yeah, well, we all do.

35:31.964 --> 35:35.448
-I hope we hear from him soon.
-Mm-hmm.

35:35.467 --> 35:39.136
Albie, if there was
something I needed to know,

35:39.287 --> 35:41.138
you'd tell me, right?

35:42.123 --> 35:43.789
You'd be my first call.

35:43.884 --> 35:45.392
All right.

you're through
with this outlaw crap.

36:41.107 --> 36:44.275
It was cute when we were 20,

It means no more

it means no more
getting into fights.

37:40.742 --> 37:43.260
Uh, simple, we're gonna
tell them the truth.

37:43.487 --> 37:48.490
That you got into a fight with
some drunks outside of my gig,

37:48.583 --> 37:53.270
you fought them off,
but then, one of them had a gun

37:53.497 --> 37:55.605
and he shot you.

for too long.

39:41.213 --> 39:45.548
Rosa... she had a child.

39:46.793 --> 39:48.134
Okay.

39:51.631 --> 39:53.431
Your mama found out about it.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.137
And she locked them in the barn
and she burned it down.

39:59.305 --> 40:00.730
She wouldn't do that.

40:00.882 --> 40:02.732
She did.

40:05.128 --> 40:07.404
But the baby survived.

And that baby is Catt Phoenix.
