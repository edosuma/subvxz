        Has to have been

00:50.251 --> 00:52.551
              Certainly was our
              best tip day ever!

00:52.586 --> 00:53.919
Well, get used
to it, Ang.

00:53.988 --> 00:54.920
You're going to be making
a lot of tips

00:54.989 --> 00:56.455
           at a place
      like Holly Hanson's.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.657
     It's definitely a perk.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.359
       I am going to miss
    working with you, though.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.193
          And I'm going
        to miss working.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.129
      I didn't get the job
         at Cafe Rouge.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.831
            I thought
     they really liked you.

01:05.866 --> 01:06.899
They did.

01:06.934 --> 01:07.933
      They just don't like

01:07.968 --> 01:09.134
        that I don't have
       a culinary degree.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.070
              That is so unfair.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.205
           You are, hands down,
           the best cook I know,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.106
         and I've worked
    in a lot of restaurants.

01:14.141 --> 01:16.708
               Mm.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.243
         I sure am going
       to miss this place.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.779
   They just don't make diners
       like this anymore.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.049
  It's not too late to take it.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.351
         I'm telling ya, someone
         is going to come in,

01:26.387 --> 01:29.521
       and turn the place
 into a juice bar or something.

01:29.557 --> 01:30.956
            Oh, Gus,
    you know I wish I could.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.225
It certainly is
a dream of mine

01:33.294 --> 01:35.527
    to own a place like this
           one day...

01:35.596 --> 01:37.429
   but I don't have the money,

01:37.465 --> 01:39.531
not to mention the lack
of business experience.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.401
                 Oh, business
                 can be learned,

01:42.436 --> 01:43.969
                     but talent?

01:44.004 --> 01:45.070
                That's something

01:45.106 --> 01:47.773
    that just comes as a gift
            to you...

01:47.808 --> 01:49.808
         and you, kiddo?

01:49.877 --> 01:51.710
        You are talented.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.713
          So you just keep
          your eye on the prize.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.082
       Some day, I'm sure
   that you'll get your dream.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.687
      Just don't forget to let
      me know when that happens.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.689
              I may be retiring,

02:03.724 --> 02:06.024
       but I'll never be too old

02:06.060 --> 02:07.860
             to come and have
             some of your chili.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.497
              Speaking of chili,

02:11.532 --> 02:15.100
    will you finally tell me
 what your secret ingredient is?

02:15.136 --> 02:16.101
            [laughs]

02:17.338 --> 02:19.037
         Cinnamon candy.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.139
            The ones that I keep
            by the cash register

02:20.207 --> 02:21.206
              for the customers?

02:21.242 --> 02:22.374
       Those are the ones.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.709
                         Well...

02:23.744 --> 02:27.012
       that would explain
  why the jar was always empty.

                   Where'd you
                   get this one?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.002
I got it at
the flea market yesterday.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.737
It's beautiful, isn't it?

02:51.772 --> 02:52.905
           So what's wrong
           with modern toasters?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.039
            Nothing.

02:54.074 --> 02:55.207
          The old ones
     just brown more evenly.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.542
             Right.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.943
   You do know that our place

02:57.978 --> 02:59.545
       is starting to look
 like a diner museum, don't you?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.579
            [laughs]

03:00.614 --> 03:01.880
             Sorry.
            I just...

03:01.916 --> 03:03.182
     I see all these things

03:03.217 --> 03:04.216
      and I just can't help
        but picture them

03:04.251 --> 03:06.084
  in my own restaurant one day.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.019
      I can't help myself.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.489
   So, how was work yesterday?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.690
             Tense.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.159
         Going from Gus' Kitchen
         to Holly Hanson's

03:14.195 --> 03:15.360
                 is a challenge.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.495
           Last night,
        she yelled at me

03:16.530 --> 03:17.763
  for carrying too many plates
           on my arm.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.499
      Well, Holly Hanson's
        is formal dining,

03:20.534 --> 03:21.934
   so I kind of see her point.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.736
             Listen,
   I hate to break it to you,

03:24.772 --> 03:26.271
     but your favorite chef
 is not the nicest chef in town.

03:27.141 --> 03:27.940
             Really?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.808
             Really.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.743
            She's condescending,

03:31.779 --> 03:33.745
             she's got this diva
             quality to her.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.514
     To tell you the truth,
 you're a better chef than her.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.448
   No, I'm a cook, not a chef.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.383
               Tomayto, tomahto.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.552
         Point is, her recipes
         aren't even that great.

03:42.022 --> 03:42.888
   Okay, I don't believe that.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.325
        I mean, she just,
    she came out of nowhere,

03:46.360 --> 03:48.293
 and she built an entire brand.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.195
  She's an award-winning chef.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.297
         She's opened up
      an entire restaurant,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.666
       and she's published
  four cookbooks in four years.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.901
          It's amazing.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.469
          Nikki, you're amazing.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.938
     You have all the skills
  to achieve the same success.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.608
        I'm just saying.

04:04.245 --> 04:05.143
          Thanks, Ang.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.447
Well, I'll just be happy
if I can get a job.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.681
   Two more interviews to go!

04:09.717 --> 04:10.816
           Good luck.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.850
Thanks!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.486
            [Nikki]:
        Hi! Good morning!

04:14.521 --> 04:15.420
            [woman]:
    Good morning! The usual?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.654
Yes, please.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.723
          Double whip.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.024
You know it.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.225
   Do you have a mocha there?

04:20.293 --> 04:21.159
           Thank you.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.796
               So, how's the job
               search going?

04:24.832 --> 04:25.831
                   Any luck yet?

04:25.866 --> 04:26.965
No, no luck,

04:27.001 --> 04:29.401
         but I'm trying
       to stay optimistic.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.236
  I'm not going to lie, though,
        it's pretty hard.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.604
           Well, I have no doubt

04:32.640 --> 04:34.740
             that you are going
             to find a job soon.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.042
         This is a big city with
         a lot of hungry people.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.610
      Well, let's hope so,

04:38.646 --> 04:39.845
      'cause if I don't get
         something soon,

04:39.880 --> 04:41.179
         I'm going to be
   one of those hungry people.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.949
           Did I hear someone
           say they were hungry?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.017
[Nikki]:
Ooh, fresh biscotti.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.084
            You know
      I can't resist that.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.753
              My father
              opened these doors

04:47.821 --> 04:49.955
          with this very recipe.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.690
            No, no, no, no,
            put your money away.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.659
When you get a job,
then we'll let you pay.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.160
             -But...
       -You heard the Mrs.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.628
    Trust me, you don't want
       to argue with her.

04:58.132 --> 04:59.765
       Marty!

04:59.800 --> 05:01.800
All right,
well, thanks.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.502
          Well, I'm off
    to another job interview.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.469
          Wish me luck!

05:06.407 --> 05:08.573
    It would be such an honor
  to be a cook here at Finique.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.242
              Yes.
          It would be.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.080
        I ate here once,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.948
and it was one of the best meals
       of my entire life.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.220
   It was on Valentine's Day,
  and my boyfriend took me out,

05:22.256 --> 05:23.855
           and we had
  the most breathtaking meal...

05:23.891 --> 05:25.824
a four-course meal

05:25.859 --> 05:26.825
with a perfectly-paired

05:26.860 --> 05:28.560
       peppery Zinfandel,

05:28.629 --> 05:30.128
   finished off with the most
   decadent chocolate souffle,

05:30.164 --> 05:31.163
        which... [laughs]

05:31.198 --> 05:33.799
  he ended up dumping me over,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.500
which wasn't so good,
as you can imagine...

05:35.569 --> 05:36.935
          [clears throat loudly]

05:36.970 --> 05:39.137
But the food
was very, very good.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.172
    Your resume doesn't state

05:40.240 --> 05:41.640
         where you went
       to culinary school.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.743
         I... I didn't.

05:44.778 --> 05:45.811
I'm self-taught.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.845
          Self-taught?

05:46.880 --> 05:47.779
Mm-hmm.

05:49.283 --> 05:51.183
    This is Finique, darling.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.552
         We don't hire amateurs.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.122
           Amateurs...

05:57.157 --> 05:58.990
  Right, of course, you don't.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.095
            Thank you
     for your consideration.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.166
      [Marty]: Not too much
        left over today,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.634
         but here it is.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.635
   So, how'd the interview go?

06:10.671 --> 06:11.503
                          Marty!

06:11.572 --> 06:12.637
                  [Marty]: What?

06:12.673 --> 06:14.406
         [wife]: Why do
         you have to be so nosy?

06:14.441 --> 06:15.374
        Look, I'm sorry.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.241
No, no!

06:16.276 --> 06:18.577
    It's okay, he can ask...

06:18.612 --> 06:19.778
            but I...

06:19.847 --> 06:20.946
        I didn't get it.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.681
           Oh, really?
            How come?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.182
Uh, well,
aside from going off

06:24.218 --> 06:26.051
on a really bad
Valentine's Day rant,

06:26.086 --> 06:27.819
 I don't have a culinary degree,

06:27.855 --> 06:30.322
   so that disqualifies me...
             again.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.523
                    [Marty]:
                    Don't worry.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.991
       I know you're going
      to get the next one.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.828
    I just wish I could open
     my own place, you know?

06:36.864 --> 06:37.996
             Mm-hmm.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.698
I mean,
I know I'm a good cook,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.900
        but I'm not good
 at convincing others that I am.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.803
         Well, your food
    is certainly convincing.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.671
            [Marty]: It sure is,
            all right.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.572
     You guys are so sweet.

06:49.076 --> 06:49.941
       Well, thanks again.

06:49.977 --> 06:50.942
              Bye!

07:26.747 --> 07:29.848
      [Nikki]: I'm so glad
       you enjoy my food.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.616
          Okay, enjoy.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.986
        I'll get you guys
        some more bread.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.057
Hey!

07:39.126 --> 07:41.726
         Wow, such a big
      turn-out today, huh?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.128
            Well, that's
            because you're here.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.262
Oh, what?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.631
                   People love
                   your cooking.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.933
        Once word got out

07:47.968 --> 07:49.634
     that you volunteer here
         on Wednesdays,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.603
         everyone comes.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.405
  You're like a rock-star chef
       for those in need.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.474
     Well, at least someone
     appreciates my cooking.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.710
      Wow, Valentine's Day
          already, huh?

07:58.745 --> 07:59.711
           Yeah, it's coming up!

07:59.746 --> 08:01.046
        I think we'll get
         some volunteers

08:01.081 --> 08:02.180
       to help us decorate
        once we're done.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.215
Count me in.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.349
                       Okay!

08:11.658 --> 08:12.491
[Angela]:
What are you doing?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.294
    Well, given that my job
    hunting isn't going so well,

08:16.330 --> 08:17.829
          I figured I might need
          to get a "day job,"

08:17.865 --> 08:18.997
                so to speak.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.365
A day job?

08:20.434 --> 08:22.000
       Yeah, you know, something
       that gives me a paycheck

08:22.035 --> 08:24.002
      while I continue to search
      for my dream job,

08:24.071 --> 08:25.804
            and since I'm pretty
            good with dogs,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.906
                I figured, uh...

08:27.941 --> 08:29.307
                maybe I could be
                a dog walker?

08:29.376 --> 08:30.275
 Nikki, you can't just give up.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.910
       I'm not giving up.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.544
      I'm just considering
         other options.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.746
        I mean, I've got
    to pay the rent somehow.

08:35.749 --> 08:36.780
             Well...

08:38.118 --> 08:38.884
  I wish I could help you out.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.318
I'm just not making

08:40.354 --> 08:41.820
        the kind of tips
       I thought I would.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.054
           Bad tippers
 at a place like Holly Hanson's?

08:44.091 --> 08:45.357
              Mm...

08:45.392 --> 08:46.525
       the tips are fine.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.859
There's just not enough of them.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.227
        Business is down.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.829
      Oh, that's too bad...

08:50.864 --> 08:52.163
         and surprising.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.200
        If you don't have
        any plans later,

08:55.269 --> 08:56.434
     maybe you could come by
           at closing,

08:56.470 --> 08:57.602
grab a glass of wine.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.839
        If Holly's there,
   maybe I can introduce you.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.707
             Really?

09:02.743 --> 09:03.742
              Yeah.

09:03.777 --> 09:04.743
       I mean, considering
        you idolize her,

09:04.778 --> 09:06.978
maybe you might
want to meet her?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.446
        Yeah, absolutely!

09:08.515 --> 09:10.048
                     I just hope

09:10.083 --> 09:11.416
  I don't make a fool of myself
      and start to ramble.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.250
    No, I can't imagine that.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.152
            Oh, yeah?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.487
     Okay, I can imagine it
          a little bit,

09:15.522 --> 09:16.588
    but it's why we love you.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.156
     -I'll see you at 10:00.
            -Mm-hmm!

09:19.560 --> 09:21.192
                      Okay!

09:21.228 --> 09:22.494
         Holly Hanson...

09:31.171 --> 09:32.270
       [man]: Look, Holly,

09:32.306 --> 09:33.605
        all I'm saying is
    that you need to try it.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.839
        The recipe needs
         to be tweaked.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.740
            [Holly]:
     I don't need to try it.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.875
         It's my recipe.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.809
             I understand
             what you're saying.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.277
   I'm just a little confused.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.212
Look, all I'm saying

09:41.248 --> 09:42.847
is that we need to come up
with a solution to the problem.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.049
                 And what is
                 the problem?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.117
         The cassoulet.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.352
       Have you tried it?

09:47.387 --> 09:48.553
                 I know what
                 it tastes like.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.322
I don't think that you do,

09:50.357 --> 09:51.523
because the recipe is bland.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.991
             Bland?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.459
              Yeah.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.295
    Perhaps the problem lies
     with my Executive Chef,

09:57.331 --> 10:01.533
        who is unable to execute
        my recipe properly.

10:01.602 --> 10:05.103
    Well, your Executive Chef
     respectfully disagrees.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.972
            I believe
  my name is on the front door,

10:07.007 --> 10:09.407
            so would you please
            stop arguing with me

10:09.443 --> 10:10.775
        and do as I say?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.447
                    Are we good?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.448
           Yes, Chef.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.016
           Thank you.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.584
      [jazz music playing]

10:30.530 --> 10:31.596
              -Hey.
              -Hey!

10:31.632 --> 10:32.631
You made it!

10:32.666 --> 10:34.466
         I did, indeed.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.101
         Wow, just look
         at this place.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.402
Yep.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.937
Listen, give me a minute.

10:38.972 --> 10:39.904
Why don't you go
wait by the bar,

10:39.940 --> 10:41.339
check out
the cute bartender.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.707
Definitely my type.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.642
              Okay!

10:49.182 --> 10:50.582
              -Hi.
              -Hi!

10:50.617 --> 10:51.850
What can I get for you?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.385
                   Glass of red
                   wine, please.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.052
House, or would you like
to see the wine list?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.387
                           Um...

10:55.422 --> 10:57.222
    Maybe you could pick out
    something special for her

10:57.257 --> 10:58.323
         from the list?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.558
 This is my best friend, Nikki.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.528
     -Nikki, this is Jerrod.
              -Hi.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.396
        Nice to meet you.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.530
Same.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.967
           How come you never
           mentioned him before?

11:09.002 --> 11:11.002
Oh, because
there's no future there.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.504
             He has a girlfriend
             or something?

11:12.572 --> 11:14.239
No, but apparently,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.408
Holly frowns
upon her employees dating.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.475
            [laughs]

11:19.479 --> 11:20.245
Here you go.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.880
Enjoy.

11:21.915 --> 11:22.781
                           Um...

11:22.849 --> 11:23.915
          a cassoulet?

11:23.950 --> 11:25.550
       Tonight's special.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.751
          On the house.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.686
              Wow!

11:27.721 --> 11:28.653
             Thanks.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.004
Hey.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.473
[Jerrod]:
What's it tonight?

11:48.508 --> 11:50.075
          Uh, something
  that pairs with frustration?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.376
                         Got it.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.450
    -See you had the special.
            -Mm-hmm.

11:58.518 --> 11:59.517
How was it?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.020
              Um...

12:02.055 --> 12:04.089
          It was, uh...

12:04.157 --> 12:06.157
          it was okay.
   I just wasn't that hungry.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.794
      But you got to try it
        at least, right?

12:09.830 --> 12:10.662
                    Mm-hmm.
                    Yeah, I did.

12:12.766 --> 12:13.665
        Did you like it?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.867
            Oh, um...

12:15.936 --> 12:17.635
     yeah, I'd pass, maybe.

12:17.671 --> 12:19.104
             Try something else,
             perhaps.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.774
What was it about it
that you didn't like?

12:22.809 --> 12:23.875
                 It was just
                 a little bland.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.076
               I think it needed
               something.

12:25.112 --> 12:25.977
                   I don't know.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.713
Good to know.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.681
                     You know...

12:31.418 --> 12:33.051
            frankly,
      I'm little surprised.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.020
It was that bad?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.356
        No, it's just...

12:38.391 --> 12:41.126
  it could have used something
   to pizzazz it up, you know?

12:41.161 --> 12:43.194
     Um... it just wasn't...

12:43.230 --> 12:44.496
  really, it didn't really have
        that "wow" factor

12:44.531 --> 12:45.363
      that I was expecting.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.865
       -The "wow" factor?
            -Mm-hmm.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.133
  You know, Holly probably just
   needs a new Executive Chef

12:48.168 --> 12:49.167
          or something.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.034
    That's what I'm thinking.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.174
     Sounds like
     you eat out a lot.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.710
          No. No, um...

12:58.745 --> 12:59.644
  I just know a lot about food.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.579
Of course you do...

13:01.615 --> 13:03.281
'cause you eat food.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.116
Now everyone's
a food critic these days.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.418
                         Oh, no.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.653
          I'm not a food critic.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.655
         Actually, a lot of
         people think that I am.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.323
      I was at the grocery store
      last week, and...

13:15.362 --> 13:17.896
 I'm sorry, did I say something
      to upset you, or...?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.167
    No.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.669
No, I just, uh...

13:24.738 --> 13:26.604
I just got some
bad news tonight.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.306
               Oh.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.174
             Sorry.

13:32.078 --> 13:33.812
      Well, if it makes you
          feel better,

13:33.880 --> 13:35.246
 I'm sure your news isn't as bad

13:35.282 --> 13:36.714
 as the feedback they're getting
       on this cassoulet.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.883
                            Shh.

       Have a good night.

    We can just talk in here.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.551
[man]: Look, if you're afraid

14:13.587 --> 14:14.786
that I'm going to see
what your office looks like,

14:14.821 --> 14:16.154
it's a little late, Holly.
I've already seen it.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.489
    [Holly]: Oh, I just have
           to catch up

14:18.525 --> 14:20.225
   on some of that paperwork.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.359
            [man]: Yeah, there's
            a pile of paperwork

14:21.394 --> 14:22.460
                  in your office

14:22.495 --> 14:23.895
                 that looks like
                 Mount Everest.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.829
              What happened
              to your assistant?

14:24.865 --> 14:26.197
                 She quit.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.799
                 So did
                 the last three.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.033
                 Holly, you need
                 to hire someone

14:29.102 --> 14:30.468
                    to organize
                    all of this.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.770
      Now, I've been asking
 for the financials for months,

14:32.806 --> 14:33.972
      and as your investor,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.406
    I'm entitled to see them
       on a regular basis.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.841
       I just don't think
         you understand.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.477
      I'm not just running
        this restaurant.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.946
         I am overseeing
        my entire brand.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.081
            Exactly,

14:43.116 --> 14:44.582
     and that's the problem.

14:44.618 --> 14:45.717
        You need to focus

14:45.752 --> 14:47.018
        and pay attention
       to the restaurant.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.888
 I completely re-vamped the menu
         six months ago

14:49.923 --> 14:51.256
        at your request.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.757
        No, what you did
       was you pulled out

14:52.826 --> 14:54.792
       some of your older
        signature dishes

14:54.828 --> 14:55.960
       instead of creating
            new ones,

14:55.996 --> 14:57.462
                and I have to be
                honest with you,

14:57.497 --> 14:58.363
        I don't think this place
        is going to survive

14:58.398 --> 14:59.197
                 with just
                 the status quo.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.100
             Please, just get me
             the paperwork soon

15:02.135 --> 15:04.035
                so I can dig
                through all this

15:04.104 --> 15:07.138
              and see how bad
              things really are.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.640
            I'll see myself out.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.917
                        I, uh...

15:20.587 --> 15:21.552
                        Hi.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.355
                  I am so sorry.

15:24.391 --> 15:25.590
             I didn't mean to be
             a fly on the wall,

15:25.659 --> 15:27.358
                     but I guess

15:27.394 --> 15:28.893
           you two didn't see me
           sitting here

15:28.962 --> 15:30.528
               when you came in,

15:30.563 --> 15:33.665
  so I just, I didn't really
  know what to do exactly, so...

15:35.602 --> 15:37.602
     A cough would have been
     the polite thing to do.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.670
    You're absolutely right.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.608
     Listen, I couldn't help
 overhearing your conversation,

15:43.643 --> 15:46.144
       and the fact that
       you need a new assistant.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.946
I'm sorry.
You are...?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.314
                    Nikki! Um...

15:49.382 --> 15:50.848
      I'm Angela's friend.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.917
   Um... Angela, your server?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.852
          Oh, yes, yes.
          The new girl.

15:54.888 --> 15:55.920
                         Mm-hmm.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.656
            Anyhow, I don't mean
            to be intrusive,

15:58.692 --> 16:00.992
     but I just happen to be
       looking for a job.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.028
    and I'm very experienced
   in the restaurant industry,

16:04.064 --> 16:07.765
   and it would be a privilege
       to work for you...

16:07.801 --> 16:09.934
   that is, if you are hiring,
           of course.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.071
      Do you know who I am?

16:13.106 --> 16:14.806
                Oh, yes,
                of course, I do!

16:14.841 --> 16:16.674
     Actually, it's kind of
     embarrassing to admit,

16:16.743 --> 16:18.109
        but I think I own
      every single cookbook

16:18.144 --> 16:19.277
   that you've ever published,

16:19.312 --> 16:21.779
           which is why it would
           mean so much to me

16:21.815 --> 16:23.281
        to work for you.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.450
 What did you say your name is,
           sweetheart?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.718
      Nikki. Nikki Turner.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.923
  And you've done office work?

16:31.992 --> 16:34.192
          Office work?

16:34.227 --> 16:36.794
     Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.130
  Did I mention I am available
      to start right away?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.267
        Criminal record?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.268
No...

16:45.772 --> 16:47.672
       although I did get
     a parking ticket once,

16:47.741 --> 16:49.741
            but I paid it
            immediately, mm-hmm.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.615
 And Angela will vouch for you,
             right?

16:57.684 --> 16:58.716
        Yes, definitely.
             Mm-hmm.

16:58.752 --> 16:59.917
        Hundred percent.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.688
      Well, I am desperate.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.291
      Uh... does that mean
         that I'm hired?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.633
   Meet me tomorrow at noon...

17:18.171 --> 17:20.137
      and that conversation
   you just eavesdropped on...

17:20.173 --> 17:21.071
     Doesn't leave the room.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.074
              Ever.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.143
             Okay, well,
             I'm going to, um...

17:26.378 --> 17:27.478
   the exit's this way, and...

17:27.547 --> 17:28.946
       you look beautiful,
           by the way.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.793
            [Marty]:
   So how come so late today?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.960
    [Nikki]: Oh, I got a job,

17:42.996 --> 17:44.162
but I don't start
'til noon.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.129
       Oh, that's great news!

17:45.165 --> 17:46.631
                Congratulations.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.799
   So you'll be cooking again?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.034
Uh, well,
not exactly.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.069
I mean, I'm working
at a restaurant,

17:51.104 --> 17:53.237
but I will be doing
office work, so...

17:53.273 --> 17:54.772
        Oh, well, there's
        nothing wrong with that.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.575
 Oh, the best part about it is,

17:57.610 --> 17:58.676
 I'll be working for a top chef

17:58.711 --> 17:59.577
        who can teach me
      the ins and the outs

17:59.646 --> 18:00.745
        of the business.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.547
      That is a smart move.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.549
            [Marty]: So,
            who's this top chef?

18:04.617 --> 18:05.683
          Holly Hanson.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.354
           [chuckling awkwardly]

18:10.423 --> 18:12.957
         Have you eaten
    at her restaurant before?

18:12.992 --> 18:14.125
                   Well, we know
                   who she is.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.160
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so late.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.261
Um, I've got to go!

18:17.297 --> 18:18.162
               Hey, don't forget
               your coffee.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.997
          Right, okay.
          Thanks! Bye.

18:20.066 --> 18:20.798
Bye!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.872
                     Oh, gosh...

18:27.907 --> 18:29.040
                           Um...

18:33.913 --> 18:36.347
                         Oh! Oh!

18:36.382 --> 18:37.782
        Gosh, your shirt!
          I'm so sorry!

18:37.817 --> 18:38.883
             I'm...

18:40.320 --> 18:41.819
              You?

18:41.855 --> 18:43.154
Well, well.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.123
   If it isn't the food critic
      from the other night.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.491
          My apologies.
  Look, I'm just running late,

18:46.526 --> 18:48.326
 and I'm just a little frazzled,
           and, um...

18:48.361 --> 18:49.393
           Yeah, I can see that.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.729
              Uh...

18:51.764 --> 18:52.830
      look, if you're here
           for dinner,

18:52.899 --> 18:53.464
     I don't think they open
        for a few hours.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.932
                         Thanks.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.567
  I'm well aware of the hours..
   and you're waiting for...?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.369
           [Holly]: Good,
           I'm glad you're here.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.071
         Paul, go ahead.
         Open the door.

19:00.106 --> 19:01.772
                I guess you guys
                have met?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.541
     [Paul]: Is there any reason
     why we should have?

19:03.576 --> 19:04.742
Uh, yes.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.377
    This is my new assistant.
       What is your name?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.045
             -Nikki.
             -Nikki.

19:08.081 --> 19:10.181
      Nikki, this is Paul,
       my Executive Chef.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.383
For God's sake, Paul.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.118
          Can you wear
          a clean shirt to work?

19:24.397 --> 19:25.396
       Well, here we are.

19:25.431 --> 19:26.931
             Okay...

19:26.966 --> 19:28.065
You can put your things
over there.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.100
                    Okay.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.434
And, um...

19:30.470 --> 19:31.769
     Uh-oh, before we start,

19:31.804 --> 19:33.704
         I need for you
   to pick up my dry cleaning.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.340
                     Oh... um...

19:36.376 --> 19:37.375
And when you get back,

19:37.410 --> 19:38.376
I'll have a couple
of other errands

19:38.411 --> 19:39.810
for you to run.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.145
                     Okay. Sure.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.413
              Absolutely!
              Whatever you need.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.873
                   Whoa, danger!

20:08.908 --> 20:10.775
              Lady with a coffee
              coming through.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.009
Do you want some?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.077
               Yeah, as long
               as it's in a cup,

20:13.146 --> 20:14.145
              not down my shirt.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.013
        Right.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.149
   How come you didn't tell me
    who you were last night?

20:18.184 --> 20:19.517
                Somehow, I doubt

20:19.552 --> 20:21.152
   that would have stopped you
    from speaking your mind.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.987
You're probably right,

20:23.022 --> 20:25.356
  but at least I wouldn't have
    put my foot in my mouth.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.960
    Truth is, you were right
      about the cassoulet.

20:28.995 --> 20:29.927
          It was bland.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.464
      Nikki, come with me.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.210
              Somewhere
              in all these boxes

20:46.246 --> 20:49.213
     are restaurant receipts
    from the last few years.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.681
                 I need you
                 to dig them out

20:50.717 --> 20:51.983
           and enter them into
           my accounting ledger.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.050
              Okay.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.318
            Any idea
      where I should start?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.353
           Not a clue.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.521
              Okay!

21:27.120 --> 21:28.152
Oops, sorry.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.155
                        Hey!

21:31.190 --> 21:32.523
           I feel like
   I haven't seen you all day.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.759
Holly's kept me
pretty busy.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.826
            [Angela]:
  Kind of feels like old times,

21:35.862 --> 21:37.428
               working together,
               right?

21:37.463 --> 21:38.729
Ah, not exactly,

21:38.765 --> 21:40.564
but at least
we're under the same roof.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.632
      Oh, Ang, five plates?

21:44.270 --> 21:45.436
                          Right.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.672
          Whew! Thanks.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.773
      Makes me really glad
          you're here.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.174
Yeah, don't forget it.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.046
             Hello?

22:31.084 --> 22:32.149
         Is anyone here?

22:34.187 --> 22:35.319
             Holly?

22:43.996 --> 22:45.062
       [door lock rattles]

22:52.238 --> 22:53.137
             Okay...

22:56.409 --> 22:57.375
              Uh...

22:58.444 --> 22:59.610
         <i> [line ringing]</i>

22:59.679 --> 23:01.712
        [Angela]: <i> Hello?</i>

23:01.748 --> 23:03.080
     Angela, thank goodness.

23:03.149 --> 23:04.415
      Nikki, where are you?

23:04.484 --> 23:06.016
  <i> I'm still at the restaurant.</i>

23:06.052 --> 23:08.185
  You are putting way too much
         into this job.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.653
        I didn't mean to.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.355
     If you can believe it,
        I got locked in.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.190
       I am not even going
           to ask how.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.459
      <i> I wish I could help,</i>
    <i> but I don't have a key.</i>

23:15.495 --> 23:17.228
    I think the cleaning crew
      comes in a few hours.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.163
   I'll just leave with them.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.232
           Okay, well,

23:21.267 --> 23:23.067
            <i> call me</i>
   <i> if you need anything else.</i>

23:23.102 --> 23:24.535
             -Okay.
             <i> -Bye.</i>

23:24.570 --> 23:25.803
              Bye.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.464
What in the world
are you doing in my kitchen?

23:53.499 --> 23:54.932
          Oh, my gosh.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.634
  Thank goodness, you're here.
        I got locked in!

23:56.702 --> 23:58.102
Of course I'm here.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.704
    The alarm company called.
 The motion detectors went off.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.706
            Oh, I...
     I didn't hear an alarm.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.241
     Who gave you permission
      to be in my kitchen?

24:04.277 --> 24:05.276
                      I'm sorry.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.478
                I just...
                I was so hungry.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.813
                 I hadn't eaten
                 all day, and...

24:08.848 --> 24:10.981
This cannot happen again.

24:11.017 --> 24:11.916
             No, it won't, ever.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.484
                    I promise...

24:13.519 --> 24:15.352
                 and again,
                 I'm very sorry.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.121
What exactly is this?

24:17.156 --> 24:20.024
    Oh, it's just a beef stew
    I kind of threw together.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.592
What is that smell?

24:21.627 --> 24:22.960
     There's a sweet aroma.

24:22.995 --> 24:23.861
          Oh, I braised the beef

24:23.930 --> 24:24.728
                in peanut butter
                and root beer.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.430
                    I freestyle
                    when I cook.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.998
     It's sort of my thing.

24:28.067 --> 24:28.933
     Could I offer you some?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.913
Have you been cooking long?

24:42.982 --> 24:45.216
            Actually,
     it's really what I do.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.550
 Before I came to work for you,

24:46.619 --> 24:48.219
          I was a cook
    at Gus' Kitchen downtown.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.654
                 Do you know it?
                 It's a diner.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.856
               Oh.

24:51.891 --> 24:52.857
       I don't do diners.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.259
You know,
I really should fire you

24:55.294 --> 24:56.794
for this little stunt
you've pulled.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.728
          Please don't.

24:57.763 --> 24:58.896
             Well...

24:58.931 --> 25:00.331
    it's not all your fault.

25:00.399 --> 25:01.599
     I should have made sure
          you were gone

25:01.634 --> 25:02.900
       before I locked up.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.702
    So you're not firing me?

25:06.239 --> 25:07.271
              Aw...

25:07.306 --> 25:09.173
     I was a struggling chef
          once myself.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.108
     I know what a wonderful
        opportunity it is

25:11.177 --> 25:13.077
         to get to work
     in a kitchen like this.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.679
     You're going to let me
         be a cook here?

25:15.715 --> 25:17.081
      No, of course not...

25:17.149 --> 25:18.349
               Oh.

25:18.384 --> 25:21.685
But if you wanted to use
the kitchen after hours,

25:21.721 --> 25:23.387
       I wouldn't object.

25:23.456 --> 25:25.322
    You'd really allow that?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.957
As long as we kept it
between us.

25:26.993 --> 25:27.958
I don't want
the rest of my staff

25:27.994 --> 25:30.094
             to know
       what a softie I am.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.729
           Yeah, um...

25:31.764 --> 25:33.631
        You have my word.
      I won't tell a soul.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.765
Great.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.233
              But thank you!
              Thank you so much!

25:36.269 --> 25:37.434
                     I... wow...

25:37.470 --> 25:38.869
        Oh!

25:38.905 --> 25:40.704
             I, um... it just...

25:40.740 --> 25:41.906
                 it really means
                 a lot to me.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.609
  Well, why don't you go home?

25:45.678 --> 25:47.511
                You've had
                such a long day.

25:47.547 --> 25:48.679
Oh...

25:48.714 --> 25:51.148
by the way,
how did you like the stew?

25:51.183 --> 25:53.417
   Oh, it's okay for a novice.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.854
         Great. Thanks.

26:08.067 --> 26:08.999
               Mm.

26:10.102 --> 26:10.968
            So good.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.211
                     [Paul]:
                     Hey, Holly.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.281
 Paul! What are you doing here?

26:24.317 --> 26:26.650
Isn't it a little early
to prep for dinner?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.519
           No, I just wanted
           to try something out,

26:28.588 --> 26:29.486
 a recipe I've been working on.

26:31.424 --> 26:34.725
   My restaurant, my recipes.

26:34.760 --> 26:35.993
  All I ask is for an open mind

26:36.062 --> 26:36.894
          until you see
      what I come up with.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.395
              Fine.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.365
     A little early for you
      to come in, isn't it?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.399
You know what they say...

26:42.435 --> 26:43.867
    early bird gets the worm,
             right?

26:54.714 --> 26:56.213
          [phone rings]

26:59.151 --> 27:00.451
           Hey, Henry!

27:00.486 --> 27:01.986
 Thank you for calling me back.

27:02.021 --> 27:02.987
            [Henry]:
  <i> Yeah, yeah, listen, Holly...</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:05.155
    <i> I've got some bad news.</i>

27:05.191 --> 27:06.890
      I was able to do some
    preliminary projections,

27:06.926 --> 27:09.226
    and your earnings report
    is worse than I thought.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.127
      [Holly]: <i> Meaning</i> ...?

27:11.464 --> 27:12.296
  Meaning you're going to have
          to find a way

27:12.365 --> 27:13.797
   to turn this place around,

27:13.866 --> 27:14.932
   or I'm not going to be able
  to keep us open much longer.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.233
   <i> Well, as a matter of fact,</i>

27:16.268 --> 27:18.902
          I am working
on some amazing ideas right now.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.270
         [Henry]: <i> I see.</i>

27:20.339 --> 27:22.773
      Well, you might want
 to run those by your investor.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.708
        I will, I will...

27:24.744 --> 27:25.743
     <i> as soon as I'm ready,</i>

27:25.811 --> 27:27.678
   <i> and you will be impressed.</i>

27:27.713 --> 27:28.879
             Great.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.447
     Let me know right away.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.023
    Oh, looks like everyone's
     coming in early today.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.592
    Yeah, just trying to make
   a good impression on Holly.

27:41.627 --> 27:43.594
    Maybe you'll last longer
  than her last few assistants.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.364
        Holly can certainly be
        a challenge to work for.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.066
        Actually, I think
       she's pretty cool.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.769
           Oh, "cool"?

27:51.837 --> 27:53.504
        That's a nice way
       of describing her.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.041
     You've worked for Holly
    for a while, haven't you?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.075
                 I have, indeed.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.679
     How did you know that?

28:01.714 --> 28:02.846
                Have you been
                asking about me?

28:04.517 --> 28:05.649
             Maybe.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.551
                     Is that so?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.787
         Well, what else
        did you find out?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.455
              Mm...

28:11.490 --> 28:12.856
              Well,
  you don't like food critics,

28:12.925 --> 28:14.758
you keep a clean
and fast-paced kitchen...

28:17.129 --> 28:18.162
     and you can't stand it

28:18.230 --> 28:19.096
     when people don't know
         the difference

28:19.131 --> 28:21.098
 between a turnip and a parsnip.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.101
    That's some good digging.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.069
                           Yeah.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.437
             I mean,

28:26.505 --> 28:29.039
      aside from being two
completely different vegetables,

28:29.075 --> 28:30.741
       there really isn't
      much of a difference.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.076
      Both root vegetables,

28:32.144 --> 28:33.077
         and both taste
      petty much the same.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.293
                  Can I help you
                  with that?

28:49.328 --> 28:50.728
         Oh, no thanks.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.696
         It's helping me
    with my weight training.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.897
       I haven't had time
     to go to the gym, so...

28:56.102 --> 28:57.201
              Um...

28:57.236 --> 28:58.102
     mind if I take a peek?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.236
           Feel free.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.207
              Aw...

29:03.242 --> 29:04.975
      heart-shaped ravioli!

29:05.010 --> 29:06.410
          Let me guess,
      for Valentine's Day?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.479
        To be determined.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.814
     And your filling is...

29:10.850 --> 29:11.815
            [sniffs]

29:11.851 --> 29:12.783
          Pine nuts...

29:13.986 --> 29:15.652
      With artichoke hearts
         and mushrooms.

29:15.688 --> 29:17.287
        Sounds delicious.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.589
        Sounds dreadful.

29:21.761 --> 29:25.262
          Rack of lamb,
     lobster, filet mignon.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.964
That's what we serve
on Valentine's Day.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.432
        Come on, Holly,
        we've been serving those

29:28.467 --> 29:31.135
  every year on Valentine's Day
      since I started here.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.402
 Can't we just switch things up?

29:32.438 --> 29:33.871
Not with that!

29:33.906 --> 29:35.038
Don't you think

29:35.074 --> 29:37.241
heart-shaped ravioli
is a little amateurish?

29:41.847 --> 29:43.313
      It's Valentine's Day!

29:43.349 --> 29:46.550
         It's all about
       hearts and flowers.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.786
         Well, those are
        the decorations,

29:48.821 --> 29:50.154
        not the cuisine.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.342
[Nikki]:
Hey, Ang...

30:12.378 --> 30:13.544
                  Yeah?

30:13.579 --> 30:14.812
Listen, I'm going
to be working late tonight,

30:14.847 --> 30:16.280
so don't wait up for me, 'kay?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.147
               Yeah, I'm staying
               late, too.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.215
    Really?

30:18.284 --> 30:20.184
        Yeah, it's Sunday night.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.985
Paul cooks dinner for the staff.
     It's kind of a ritual.

30:23.155 --> 30:23.954
        That sounds fun.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.088
                          It is.

30:25.124 --> 30:25.989
             You should join us.

30:27.993 --> 30:28.926
          Maybe I will.

            Give me your review.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.033
   Well, I'm no food critic...

31:10.069 --> 31:11.235
               We've already
               established that.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.369
            [laughs]

31:12.404 --> 31:15.005
              Please, you can
              be honest with me.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.244
 Okay, the only thing I noticed,

31:20.312 --> 31:23.046
         and seriously,
        it's excellent...

31:23.082 --> 31:26.450
 but it's just that I've tasted
   this exact same pappardelle

31:26.485 --> 31:27.885
      at other restaurants.

31:27.953 --> 31:31.822
     I mean, yours is by far
 one of the best I've ever had,

31:31.857 --> 31:33.156
but...

31:33.192 --> 31:34.358
there's nothing about it

31:34.426 --> 31:36.760
          that tells me
        that you made it.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.898
Oh, I'm sorry, Paul.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.099
       Look, I didn't mean
         to offend you.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.300
          It's just...
  I can be a little opinionated

31:43.369 --> 31:44.601
     when it comes to food,
             and...

31:44.637 --> 31:45.936
I just...

31:47.373 --> 31:49.907
I guess I just have
my own style of cooking.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.477
   Your own style of cooking?

31:56.215 --> 31:57.814
        Ice cream cones.

31:57.850 --> 32:00.717
   I can see it in a dessert,
     but in a dinner recipe?

32:00.786 --> 32:02.519
       I dredged the bird
      in yogurt and honey,

32:02.588 --> 32:04.955
  then coated it in the cones,
       and onto the fryer.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.960
  It's like chicken and waffles
           all in one.

32:09.995 --> 32:12.296
That sounds just perfect...

32:12.331 --> 32:14.064
for a county fair.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.732
            You're a real food
            snob, you know that?

32:15.768 --> 32:16.633
I studied
at the Cordon Bleu.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.468
       Of course you did.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.570
 What is that supposed to mean?

32:20.606 --> 32:22.739
          It's just...

32:22.775 --> 32:24.341
         Well, you know,

32:24.376 --> 32:25.842
        schools like that
      are very structured,

32:25.878 --> 32:27.144
      very black and white.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.478
    There's not a lot of room
            for gray.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.414
     But those are the tools
        that a chef needs

32:30.449 --> 32:32.149
            in order
   to rise above the mediocre.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.018
To me,
gourmet cooking is a fine art.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.987
                Well, what about
                abstract art?

32:38.958 --> 32:40.123
I'm guessing
that's your preference.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.959
        I'm just saying,
   crayons can make art, too.

32:41.994 --> 32:42.926
Fair enough.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.562
                           Okay.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.872
               So?

32:59.211 --> 33:00.477
It's apparent
that you're not a cook.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.347
You are a chef.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.316
      This is outstanding.

33:07.553 --> 33:08.552
    Do you really mean that?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.821
   You certainly have a style.

33:10.856 --> 33:13.023
             Thanks.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.458
        You have no idea

33:14.493 --> 33:15.492
       what it means to me
      to hear you say that.

33:16.795 --> 33:17.928
                I mean, I love
                this job, but...

33:19.098 --> 33:20.864
        I just miss being
         in the kitchen.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.434
                        So...

33:26.238 --> 33:28.839
Well, cheers to you,
food critic Nikki Turner.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.240
            [laughs]

33:30.275 --> 33:31.241
    We're cheers'ing chicken?

33:31.276 --> 33:32.709
   What else would you expect

33:32.745 --> 33:35.212
   from an uptight, structured
   Cordon Bleu Executive Chef?

33:44.890 --> 33:47.024
          [Nikki]: It is so nice
          to be here

33:47.059 --> 33:48.258
           and just relax today.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.626
     You must be exhausted.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.528
You have had
a lot of late nights this week.

33:51.563 --> 33:53.830
             I hope
  Holly is paying you overtime.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.599
       She is... sort of.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.136
       You deserve a medal
    for putting up with her.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.404
       No, she's seriously
          not that bad.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.972
  She's been pretty nice to me.

34:02.007 --> 34:04.007
Okay, I can't quite wrap
my head around that, but...

34:05.511 --> 34:08.545
 maybe you remind her of herself
       when she was young.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.880
             Hmm...

34:09.915 --> 34:10.947
             Maybe.

34:10.983 --> 34:12.349
    [Angela]: Uh, by the way,

34:12.384 --> 34:14.351
       I picked up a shift
       on Valentine's Day.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.920
    You mean I have to watch
     "When Harry Met Sally"

34:16.955 --> 34:17.754
    all by myself this year?

34:18.857 --> 34:20.190
              Well,
 as much as I want to reminisce

34:20.225 --> 34:21.725
about the cons
of Valentine's Day

34:21.760 --> 34:22.726
and eat chocolate,

34:22.795 --> 34:25.062
   it's a big night for tips.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.630
         Not to mention,

34:26.665 --> 34:27.898
       this way, I can say
     I spent Valentine's Day

34:27.966 --> 34:28.931
          with Jerrod.

34:28.967 --> 34:29.966
            [laughs]

34:30.002 --> 34:30.967
              Okay.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.404
      Hey, how do you like
       working with Paul?

34:35.474 --> 34:36.840
              Paul?

34:36.909 --> 34:38.942
   As in Executive Chef Paul?

34:38.976 --> 34:40.476
           Yeah, Paul,

34:40.545 --> 34:43.313
  as in "the guy who's cooking
 behind the stove all day" Paul.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.915
          Don't tell me
     you're crushing on him.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.784
            What? No!

34:47.853 --> 34:50.187
    Come on, I just think
    he's a really talented chef.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.688
            Besides,
    I don't crush on people.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.989
       It's not my thing.

34:53.025 --> 34:54.157
Oh, no,
of course not.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.324
So...

34:55.360 --> 34:57.694
          but you guys
   have been chatting, right?

34:57.729 --> 34:59.963
      Yeah, we've had a few
  conversations here and there.

34:59.998 --> 35:00.964
          Nothing big.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.332
             Really?

35:02.367 --> 35:03.867
      So what have you guys
      been chatting about?

35:03.936 --> 35:08.004
       Cooking and recipes
           and stuff.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.140
             Huh...
     yeah, sounds boring...

35:10.175 --> 35:12.943
although
for a couple of chefs...

35:12.978 --> 35:15.278
       sounds like you two
   might have a lot in common.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.080
      Okay, you're reading
     way too much into this.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.748
              Am I?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.220
      If you're smart about it,
      Holly will never find out.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.488
Angela's best friend
is Nikki,

35:24.523 --> 35:25.388
and Nikki
is Holly's assistant.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.029
I wouldn't
worry about it.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.297
I don't think that Nikki
would say anything to Holly.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.832
       You don't know that
            for sure.

35:35.868 --> 35:37.033
  I've got a feeling about her.
  I don't think that she would.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.503
   Because if I wait too long
         to ask her out,

35:39.538 --> 35:40.036
   then I run the risk of her
      meeting someone else.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.471
That's true.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.406
    But if I ask her out now,
I run the risk of getting fired.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.976
    Tough choices, my friend.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.043
         Tough choices.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.583
         -There you go.
        -Thanks so much.

37:09.161 --> 37:10.794
[laughs] Okay...

37:10.829 --> 37:12.329
            I saw you
     at the Farmer's Market,

37:12.364 --> 37:13.830
      and I was wondering,
 "What's with all the produce?"

37:13.865 --> 37:15.532
       Well, now you know.

37:15.567 --> 37:16.666
        So you work here?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.602
No, no.
I just volunteer here.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.936
The Center serves
free meals to families,

37:19.972 --> 37:23.640
       or anyone, really,
 who's in need or hungry, so...

37:23.675 --> 37:24.741
    I cook here twice a week.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.277
     What's on today's menu?

37:27.312 --> 37:30.580
There's red lentil soup
with bacon and turnips.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.250
   Then we have ham, chicken,
     and cheese sandwiches.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.252
 The ham and cheese are leftover
        from last night.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.353
                   I'm beginning
                   to understand

37:36.388 --> 37:37.887
             where you developed
             your style.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.889
        Oh! I see.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.725
My style is
too refined for you?

37:44.162 --> 37:45.629
            Pass me a knife.
            I'll start chopping.

37:59.111 --> 38:00.310
                       Cardamom?
                       In that?

38:00.345 --> 38:01.645
Mm-hmm.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.617
          You're right.

38:07.686 --> 38:08.885
      It gives it the kick.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.687

         No, it was fun.

38:18.196 --> 38:19.496
       It's a nice change
     from working for Holly.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.697
Yeah?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.132
Why do you stay there?

38:22.167 --> 38:23.500
I mean, just because
you could work anywhere.

38:25.304 --> 38:26.169
         Holly gave me my start.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.170
                I owe her.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.005
     Mm...

38:29.074 --> 38:31.408
I guess the food's just
not as I imagined, you know?

38:31.443 --> 38:33.777
I thought it'd be more...
innovative.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.278
       You know, Holly's problem
       is that she just...

38:35.314 --> 38:36.780
         she tries to control...

38:36.815 --> 38:37.881
                  everything.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.116
  She wasn't always like that.

38:40.185 --> 38:42.786
 The Holly that gave me my start
 was original, collaborative...

38:44.690 --> 38:45.388
                  She's changed.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.526
         A pop-up shop?

38:51.063 --> 38:52.028
                     Yeah, yeah.

38:52.064 --> 38:53.296
                It's this really
                cool idea.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.398
     Just rent unused space
      for a couple of days,

38:55.467 --> 38:57.267
    and pop up your own shop,
          so to speak.

38:57.302 --> 38:59.035
    Nice!

38:59.104 --> 39:00.103
                  Hot chocolate?

39:00.138 --> 39:01.338
Yeah, sure.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.048
       [Paul]: You cooked
        at Gus' Kitchen?

39:12.084 --> 39:13.083
                   Mm-hmm.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.351
I loved that place.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.452
                   Really?

39:15.520 --> 39:16.386
              I never would have
              figured you

39:16.421 --> 39:17.721
                 as a diner guy.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.155
Just because I cook
gourmet cuisine

39:19.191 --> 39:20.190
doesn't mean
that's all I eat.

39:20.225 --> 39:21.891
                     Okay.

39:21.927 --> 39:22.992
    So what happened
    to Gus'?

39:23.028 --> 39:24.427
    I never heard
    why it closed.

39:24.496 --> 39:25.729
                   Oh, it's sad,
                   really.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.864
            He tried really hard
            to sell the place,

39:27.899 --> 39:30.834
     but everyone wants a modern
     restaurant these days.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.136
                    No one wants
                    a diner.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.138
              So anyway, he
              decided to retire,

39:35.173 --> 39:36.840
           and his kids didn't
           want to take it over.

39:38.276 --> 39:41.111
I've had a few of those
discussions myself.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.947
My Dad wanted me to take over
the family business.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.148
I had other plans.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.784
        Oh, the age-old
        father-son disagreement.

39:49.121 --> 39:50.420
What about you?

39:50.455 --> 39:52.489
         [Nikki]: Well,
     my mom was a waitress,

39:52.524 --> 39:55.558
           and my dad
 is a restaurant food supplier,

39:55.594 --> 39:56.526
      so I guess, in a way,

39:56.561 --> 39:57.894
            I did go
    into the family business.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.533
         [Paul]: Is this
the best hot chocolate, or what?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.368
            [Nikki]:
       It is really good.

40:05.437 --> 40:06.703
  There's some ingredient in it

40:06.772 --> 40:08.371
      that I just can't put
          my finger on.

40:09.775 --> 40:10.607
Lavender.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.175
               Mm.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.676
           Of course!
          It's so good.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.946
    You know, the only thing
   that would make this better

40:16.982 --> 40:19.048
   would be an almond biscotti
        from Dellucci's.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.083
     Do you know that place?

40:21.186 --> 40:22.085
         Is that a joke?

40:24.423 --> 40:25.588
               No.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.523
        Just a question.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.559
             Why are you looking
             at me like that?

40:29.594 --> 40:31.361
      My last name
      is Dellucci.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.230
         Marty and Trish
        are your parents?

40:34.299 --> 40:35.331
      Wait, you know them?

40:35.367 --> 40:36.699
                Are you kidding?

40:36.735 --> 40:38.501
       I've gone in there,
         like, every day

40:38.537 --> 40:40.270
     for the last two years,

40:40.305 --> 40:41.471
although I've gone in there less

40:41.506 --> 40:42.772
     since I started working
        for Holly, but...

40:44.009 --> 40:45.475
           it's funny.

40:45.510 --> 40:46.743
        When I told them
    I started working there,

40:46.778 --> 40:48.077
             they...
    they didn't mention you.

40:48.113 --> 40:48.978
Makes sense.

40:50.916 --> 40:51.881
         It's no secret
      that my father and I

40:51.917 --> 40:52.949
           don't have
     the best relationship.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.386
           Dellucci's
     is the family business

40:56.421 --> 40:57.353
       you didn't go into.

40:57.389 --> 40:59.222
      Yup.

40:59.257 --> 41:02.325
I wanted to go to Paris,
study at the Cordon Bleu.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.327
My father saw that
as a slap in the face.

41:04.362 --> 41:05.328
He couldn't understand

41:05.363 --> 41:06.863
why I would want
something different

41:06.898 --> 41:08.331
than him and my grandfather.

41:09.734 --> 41:10.733
We both stood our ground,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.001
with my mom stuck
in the middle.

41:13.271 --> 41:14.137
       Long story short...

41:15.540 --> 41:17.140
 we don't see much of each other
           these days.

41:18.677 --> 41:19.476
             Sorry.

41:21.746 --> 41:22.645
   I wish there was something
       I could do to help.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.582
           It's okay.

41:25.617 --> 41:26.783
       It is what it is...

41:30.922 --> 41:32.522
but you are right.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.424
 One of their biscottis would go
   great with this right now.

41:36.495 --> 41:37.494
         [Nikki giggles]

41:47.939 --> 41:49.072
[Nikki]:
Morning, Trish.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.373
I'm just going
to have a black coffee today.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.307
                     You got it.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.479
               Listen, can I ask
               you something?

41:56.515 --> 41:58.281
          It's kind of personal.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.418
           Yeah, sure.

42:02.454 --> 42:04.621
What's, uh, what's on your mind?

42:04.656 --> 42:06.356
             Well...

42:06.424 --> 42:08.324
     how come I didn't know
     that Paul was your son?

42:10.395 --> 42:11.294
          I'm so sorry.

42:12.464 --> 42:13.563
                 I really wanted
                 to tell you.

42:13.598 --> 42:15.265
            I just couldn't find
            the right moment.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.769
  Things have been so strained
     between Paul and Marty,

42:19.838 --> 42:21.104
        that it's been...

42:21.172 --> 42:22.438
     well, it's been tough.

42:22.507 --> 42:23.973
        Oh, I'd imagine.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.009
            But I knew you'd
            find out eventually.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.578
                       Here.

42:28.647 --> 42:30.213
Oh, how can I resist?

42:32.484 --> 42:34.551
        Paul actually called
        last night to say hello.

42:34.619 --> 42:36.019
            -He did?
            -Mm-hmm.

42:36.087 --> 42:39.122
     And he had an awful lot
     of questions about you.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.156
             Really?

42:40.191 --> 42:42.058
                       Oh, sure.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.161
      Who we talking about?

42:45.230 --> 42:46.462
   [Nikki and Trish]: No one.

42:46.531 --> 42:49.132
                   Mm-hmm. Paul.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.633
  You were talking about Paul.

42:50.702 --> 42:51.534
I was just saying

42:51.570 --> 42:53.703
  that I wasn't even surprised

42:53.738 --> 42:55.004
           to find out
      that he was your son.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.072
     You weren't surprised?

42:56.107 --> 42:57.640
                         Really?

42:57.676 --> 42:58.675
             How so?

42:58.710 --> 42:59.976
Oh, well, uh...

43:00.011 --> 43:02.011
        in a lot of ways,
I think that he takes after you.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.980
       You know, he's one
 of the best chefs in the city,

43:04.015 --> 43:06.349
      you're the best baker
         in the city...

43:06.384 --> 43:07.617
       Glad you think so,

43:07.652 --> 43:08.952
    but I don't think my son
      is all that impressed

43:08.987 --> 43:10.253
                   by my baking.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.588
     Wait, are you kidding?

43:11.623 --> 43:12.822
   No, he was actually talking

43:12.857 --> 43:14.090
        about how amazing
    your almond biscotti are

43:14.125 --> 43:15.758
           yesterday.

43:15.794 --> 43:17.093
             Really?

43:17.128 --> 43:18.494
Really.

43:18.563 --> 43:22.065
As a cook, I mean,
he is just so talented.

43:24.035 --> 43:26.202
          Anyway, uh...

43:26.237 --> 43:29.272
        thanks for this,
 and I'll see you guys tomorrow.

43:33.812 --> 43:35.678
                  "So talented."

43:35.714 --> 43:36.779
              Did you hear that?

43:36.815 --> 43:38.681
Yeah, yeah,
I heard it.

43:38.717 --> 43:40.016
                           Good.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.951
                   Just wanted

from your usual cuisine.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.235
               Oh!

45:39.270 --> 45:40.369
Wow!

45:40.405 --> 45:41.370
Holly...

45:42.941 --> 45:44.707
       If your new dishes
    are as good as this one,

45:44.743 --> 45:45.975
     we won't have anything
         to worry about.

45:53.218 --> 45:54.884
          [door opens]

45:58.690 --> 46:00.923
        Oh... I.... um...

46:17.342 --> 46:18.241
          [Nikki gasps]

46:19.077 --> 46:20.009
               Hi!

46:20.044 --> 46:21.010
              Paul!

46:22.580 --> 46:24.213
         Hi, uh, whew...

46:24.249 --> 46:25.548
          you scared me
         half to death.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.983
Believe me,
it was unintentional.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.885
  You know, I almost flattened
    your head with a skillet.

46:28.953 --> 46:29.919
     Well, maybe next time,
     go for the rolling pin.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.323
       What are you doing
     sneaking around anyway?

46:34.359 --> 46:36.259
     I wouldn't call coming
   into my place of employment

46:36.294 --> 46:37.226
        sneaking around.

46:37.262 --> 46:38.427
                    Point taken.

46:38.463 --> 46:40.263
Also, I have a key.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.230
                        So do I.

46:43.268 --> 46:44.967
         You have a key?

46:45.036 --> 46:46.269
 Why would Holly give you a key?

46:47.906 --> 46:49.005
      Because she likes me.

46:49.040 --> 46:49.939
             A lot.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.212
      It took her two years
         to give me one.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.213
     What is going on here?

46:58.383 --> 46:59.816
         I gave my word
    I wouldn't say anything.

47:01.386 --> 47:02.518
       You gave your word
   you wouldn't say anything?

47:02.554 --> 47:03.820
    Come on, what's going on?

47:03.855 --> 47:05.021
              I...

47:07.592 --> 47:09.091
     Holly just lets me cook
          after hours.

47:09.127 --> 47:10.660
              Why?

47:11.796 --> 47:12.895
      Because she found out
           I'm a cook,

47:12.931 --> 47:14.463
 and, well, for whatever reason,

47:14.499 --> 47:15.598
     she told me to have fun
        and do my thing.

47:16.768 --> 47:17.733
         Well, it looks
        like your "thing"

47:17.769 --> 47:19.268
          is about to boil over.

47:19.304 --> 47:21.204
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

47:22.607 --> 47:23.706
Looks interesting.

47:24.943 --> 47:26.876
         It looks awful.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.477
       "Awful" is the word
       that you were looking for

47:28.513 --> 47:30.046
     to describe that, okay?

47:30.081 --> 47:33.115
     Listen, don't judge me.
     I was just, you know...

47:33.151 --> 47:35.318
              experimenting with
              savory and sweet,

47:35.353 --> 47:38.688
          so I threw in a couple
          kettle corn, and...

47:38.756 --> 47:41.958
      well, as you can see,
the sugar caramelized and burnt.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.060
You going to go
for round two?

47:44.095 --> 47:45.328
           Uh, no, no.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.296
     I think I've had enough
      upsets for one night,

47:47.332 --> 47:48.397
   so the kitchen's all yours.

47:48.433 --> 47:51.400
          I'm assuming
    that's why you snuck in?

47:51.436 --> 47:52.635
I came in...

47:52.704 --> 47:53.569
    to try out something new
            of my own

47:53.605 --> 47:54.770
      for Valentine's Day.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.839
      Thought it would meet
     with Holly's approval.

47:56.875 --> 47:58.574
            Oh, well,
     mind if I stick around?

47:58.610 --> 47:59.876
         I'd like that.

48:14.659 --> 48:15.825
   [Paul, on monitor]: <i> Uh</i> ...

48:15.860 --> 48:17.293
      [Nikki]: <i> Blueberries?</i>

48:17.328 --> 48:18.628
          [Paul]: <i> Yup!</i>

48:18.663 --> 48:19.829
    <i> I'm grilling pork chops</i>
        <i> with blueberries</i>

48:19.898 --> 48:21.631
     <i> and a balsamic glaze.</i>

48:21.666 --> 48:22.365
         [Nikki]: <i> Nice!</i>

48:26.437 --> 48:27.336
           [laughing]

48:29.908 --> 48:32.174
      Holly would be crazy
        not to like this.

48:32.210 --> 48:33.709
          It's perfect
      for Valentine's Day.

48:33.745 --> 48:34.644
                  I was thinking

48:34.679 --> 48:36.245
         maybe to do it
         as a pork loin

48:36.314 --> 48:37.246
     instead of a pork chop

48:37.315 --> 48:38.314
          so it could be shared.

48:38.349 --> 48:39.348
                You know,
                a lot of couples

48:39.384 --> 48:40.716
         want to come in
       for a romantic meal

48:40.785 --> 48:41.784
       and order for two.

48:41.819 --> 48:44.153
       Yeah, I understand
          the concept.

48:44.188 --> 48:45.922
 I just don't practice it much.

48:45.957 --> 48:47.423
                  What, ordering
                  for two?

48:47.458 --> 48:48.658
   No, the romantic meal part.

48:48.693 --> 48:50.660
              I hear you.

48:50.728 --> 48:51.961
             Being in the
             restaurant business

48:51.996 --> 48:52.895
         doesn't leave you much
         time for personal life.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.664
  Yeah, not to mention the fact

48:54.732 --> 48:58.267
  that manning a grill all day
 makes a chef smell like grease.

49:00.872 --> 49:01.771
        So, no boyfriend?

49:01.839 --> 49:04.006
        No, no boyfriend.

49:04.042 --> 49:05.775
  I had a serious relationship
         two years ago,

49:05.843 --> 49:07.376
           but, um...

49:07.412 --> 49:09.845
we worked together,
and it just got too messy.

49:11.149 --> 49:12.715
           I can totally relate.

49:12.784 --> 49:15.651
           I once dated
           a fellow chef, and...

49:15.687 --> 49:17.019
      after a disagreement,

49:17.055 --> 49:18.454
   she sabotaged my bolognese

49:18.489 --> 49:19.789
       with an entire jar
       of cayenne pepper.

49:19.824 --> 49:20.990
            [laughs]

49:21.025 --> 49:23.225
      Yeah, that experience
      definitely taught me

49:23.261 --> 49:25.995
       never date someone
       that you work with.

49:26.064 --> 49:31.067
 Yeah, better not to complicate
  your work and personal life.

49:36.908 --> 49:37.707
              So...

49:39.410 --> 49:40.977
          what happened
 with you and your ex-boyfriend?

49:42.180 --> 49:43.245
       Well, for starters,

49:43.314 --> 49:45.214
     we just weren't really
           a good fit,

49:45.249 --> 49:46.615
           but mostly,

49:46.651 --> 49:48.484
     he just didn't support
           my dreams,

49:48.519 --> 49:49.452
          and it hurt.

49:50.822 --> 49:51.921
    So what are your dreams?

49:51.956 --> 49:53.622
To open up
a place like this one day.

49:55.793 --> 49:56.959
You know,
looking back, I...

49:58.463 --> 49:59.595
I guess deep down,
I always knew

49:59.630 --> 50:01.397
we weren't a match.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.199
I just wasn't really
honest with myself.

50:03.234 --> 50:06.936
Anyhow, weeks
turned into months,

50:06.971 --> 50:08.104
months turned into a year,

50:08.172 --> 50:11.207
       and Valentine's Day
         rolled around,

50:11.242 --> 50:13.876
  and he took me out to dinner.

50:13.911 --> 50:16.579
          I was certain
    he was going to propose,

50:16.647 --> 50:19.315
    but he broke up with me.

50:21.652 --> 50:22.485
       On Valentine's Day?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.953
              Yeah.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.021
       So it's safe to say

50:25.089 --> 50:27.123
         I'm not really
    a Valentine's Day person.

50:27.158 --> 50:30.326
 Well, here's to us single chefs
        around the world.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.161
                   May we find
                   companionship

50:32.230 --> 50:34.063
                in the food
                that we prepare.

50:34.098 --> 50:36.399
To the food
that we prepare!

50:36.434 --> 50:38.701
 [Holly]: What a beautiful meal
         you're sharing.

50:38.736 --> 50:40.136
Oh, did the alarm go off?

50:40.204 --> 50:41.771
            [Paul]: We were just
            cooking, and...

50:41.839 --> 50:43.606
 Just decided to make yourselves
 a nice romantic dinner for two.

50:43.674 --> 50:44.573
                       [Nikki]:
                       Romantic?

50:44.609 --> 50:45.841
No, not at all.

50:45.877 --> 50:47.143
[Holly]:
Nikki, I was very clear

50:47.178 --> 50:49.045
         about the terms
        of our agreement.

50:49.080 --> 50:50.179
         I trusted you,

50:50.214 --> 50:51.247
      and you have betrayed
           my trust...

50:51.315 --> 50:54.683
and Paul, how in the world
is it possible

50:54.719 --> 50:55.651
that you think
it's appropriate

50:55.686 --> 50:57.119
         to have a date,

50:57.155 --> 51:00.489
on my dime, after hours,
in my restaurant?

51:00.525 --> 51:01.357
           Holly, there's
           nothing inappropriate

51:01.426 --> 51:02.525
         going on here.

51:02.593 --> 51:03.626
             Holly,
  if you just let me explain...

51:03.661 --> 51:06.095
I'm going to make this
easy on all of us.

51:06.130 --> 51:07.229
       You're both fired.

51:08.966 --> 51:09.899
                Are you serious?

51:09.934 --> 51:10.866
              Very.

51:15.606 --> 51:16.939
                Come on,, Nikki.

51:17.008 --> 51:18.507
           We've been liberated.

51:30.955 --> 51:32.154
         Can you figure out what
         just happened in there?

51:32.190 --> 51:34.290
Other than the fact
that we both just got fired?

51:34.325 --> 51:35.791
           No.

51:35.827 --> 51:38.127
         Here.

51:38.162 --> 51:39.128
       Come on.

51:39.163 --> 51:40.429
                    Thanks.

51:40.465 --> 51:41.797
           I can't help but feel

51:41.833 --> 51:42.798
           like this whole thing
           is all my fault.

51:42.834 --> 51:43.799
             I'm so sorry, Paul.

51:43.868 --> 51:44.934
No, you shouldn't be.

51:44.969 --> 51:46.202
I'm the one
who has history with Holly.

51:46.237 --> 51:48.204
I'm sure that her anger
was just directed at me.

51:48.239 --> 51:49.772
You're just in
the wrong place

51:49.841 --> 51:51.240
at the wrong time.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.408
                   I don't know.

51:52.443 --> 51:53.742
What was she doing
in the restaurant tonight?

51:54.879 --> 51:56.545
       She never comes in
          after hours.

51:56.581 --> 51:58.013
       Well, it's not like
     we can go back in there

51:58.049 --> 51:58.981
          and ask her.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.017
   I guess it doesn't matter.

52:02.053 --> 52:03.619
  Just... my head is spinning.

52:05.189 --> 52:06.021
         Yeah, mine too.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.294
               Hi.

52:14.298 --> 52:15.397
            Come on.

52:21.839 --> 52:23.706
         Coast is clear.
          Holly's gone.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.374
  I'm just going to grab my bag
      and then I'll be out.

52:25.409 --> 52:26.475
                           Okay.

52:26.511 --> 52:27.409
I'll be quick.

52:31.048 --> 52:32.014
                 Go, go, go, go!

52:32.049 --> 52:32.982
                    Okay, quick.

52:36.821 --> 52:37.987
           A new menu?

52:40.925 --> 52:41.824
            What? No!

52:43.661 --> 52:44.460
             No way!

52:44.495 --> 52:45.728
                           What?

52:45.763 --> 52:48.264
     [Nikki]: Peanut Butter
     Root Beer Bourguignon?

52:48.299 --> 52:49.431
      Waffle Fried Chicken?

52:49.467 --> 52:50.900
Lamb mole?

52:50.935 --> 52:52.501
Sound familiar?

52:52.537 --> 52:53.769
        Yeah, those sound
       like your recipes.

52:53.838 --> 52:54.904
They are my recipes!

53:02.346 --> 53:03.312
           I can't believe this!

53:03.347 --> 53:04.613
      Surveillance footage?

53:04.649 --> 53:05.648
    Why would she record you?

53:07.952 --> 53:09.318
             Because
   she's stealing my recipes.

53:17.061 --> 53:18.060
[Angela]: Oh...

53:20.698 --> 53:22.598
Should've known
you'd be cleaning.

53:22.633 --> 53:23.899
You're always cleaning
when you're upset.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.836
    I've cleaned all of these
         twice already.

53:29.574 --> 53:30.406
       You're home early.

53:32.710 --> 53:33.876
 Wait, did Holly fire you, too?

53:33.911 --> 53:36.645
             No, no.

53:36.681 --> 53:38.280
     She did give the staff
      the week off, though.

53:38.316 --> 53:40.849
They're doing renovations
at the restaurant.

53:40.918 --> 53:42.685
She's going to re-open
with the new menu

53:42.753 --> 53:44.520
right after Valentine's Day.

53:45.690 --> 53:46.622
           Actually...

53:46.657 --> 53:48.290
           your menu.

54:05.409 --> 54:06.642
     I just don't understand

54:06.677 --> 54:08.811
        how she can have
  the entire world in her hand,

54:08.846 --> 54:11.046
    and then rip off someone
        who's struggling.

54:11.115 --> 54:13.148
         It's not right.
     I mean, it isn't fair.

54:13.184 --> 54:14.316
             I always knew
             Holly could go low,

54:14.352 --> 54:16.318
             but I never thought
             she'd go that low.

54:16.354 --> 54:17.519
Hey, listen, um...

54:17.588 --> 54:18.754
I have to head
to your parents' bakery

54:18.789 --> 54:19.788
to pick up
some dinner rolls.

54:19.824 --> 54:21.056
You want to come with me?

54:22.627 --> 54:23.993
                     Uh...

54:24.061 --> 54:24.960
                think I'll pass.

54:27.898 --> 54:29.565
       Listen, Paul, um...

54:29.600 --> 54:30.466
       I've been thinking
     about your relationship

54:30.534 --> 54:31.834
      with your dad, and...

54:31.869 --> 54:35.437
it seems like maybe you two
just need to talk it out?

54:35.506 --> 54:37.039
    Seems like you both feel
         misunderstood.

54:37.074 --> 54:38.674
                  Misunderstood?

54:38.709 --> 54:40.042
           Do you know

54:40.077 --> 54:41.377
  that he has never even tried
    anything that I've made?

54:43.648 --> 54:44.613
                   It's probably
                   for the best.

54:44.649 --> 54:45.781
  He can be really judgmental.

54:46.851 --> 54:48.317
  No... you're an amazing chef.

54:48.352 --> 54:49.752
       I'm sure he'd love
    anything that you cooked.

54:52.189 --> 54:53.122
             Look...

54:54.492 --> 54:56.325
            Nikki...

54:56.394 --> 54:57.393
        the relationship
    between me and my father,

54:57.428 --> 54:58.627
             it's...

54:58.663 --> 55:00.696
        it's complicated.

55:00.731 --> 55:01.864
              I know you're just
              trying to help...

55:03.768 --> 55:05.734
          but I'd rather you not
          get involved, okay?

55:07.071 --> 55:07.903
     Sure.

55:20.951 --> 55:21.850
Paul, we can't
thank you enough

55:21.919 --> 55:23.118
for helping out today.

55:23.154 --> 55:24.687
           Happy to do it again.

55:24.755 --> 55:27.323
           My schedule
     is suddenly wide open.

55:28.626 --> 55:30.292
And Nikki,
a really great meal again.

55:30.328 --> 55:31.560
Everyone loved it.

55:31.595 --> 55:33.062
          Thanks, Beth.
Well, Paul was a huge help, too.

55:33.097 --> 55:34.229
[Beth]: You know,

55:34.265 --> 55:35.631
you really need
to get your own restaurant.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.533
It would be a hit,
I'm telling you.

55:38.703 --> 55:40.169
     She is right, you know.

55:46.243 --> 55:47.209
            A pop-up!

55:48.646 --> 55:49.545
Hot chocolate! Hey!

55:49.613 --> 55:50.879
     You remember that place

55:50.948 --> 55:52.815
  that we got the hot chocolate
       from, that pop-up?

55:52.850 --> 55:53.782
      Yeah.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.519
                 What if
                 we opened up...

55:57.588 --> 55:58.487
      [together]: A pop-up.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.655
                     Right?

56:00.825 --> 56:01.990
I think you're onto
something here, Nik.

56:02.059 --> 56:03.325
    I mean, all we have to do
       is find a space...

56:03.394 --> 56:04.626
    That's closed or vacant,

56:04.662 --> 56:06.862
has a really good kitchen.

56:06.897 --> 56:08.297
           I know just the spot.

56:09.900 --> 56:11.233
       [Gus]: Pop-up what?

56:11.268 --> 56:12.501
             [Nikki]: Just think
             of it as a rental.

56:12.536 --> 56:14.002
     We'll lease this space
         for three days,

56:14.038 --> 56:14.903
    and then we'll return it
      just as we found it.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.507
Well, don't hear anyone
banging on the door,

56:18.542 --> 56:19.708
wanting to take it over.

56:19.744 --> 56:21.143
        So, that's a yes?

56:21.178 --> 56:22.344
          Yes, indeed.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.214
         Thank you, Gus!

56:25.282 --> 56:26.281
            We'll go to the bank

56:26.317 --> 56:27.649
            and get your deposit
            right away.

56:27.685 --> 56:28.417
Oh, there's no rush.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.520
         This all sounds
     very exciting, you two.

56:34.658 --> 56:35.958
This is fantastic!

56:35.993 --> 56:37.292
      It's the perfect way
   for me to try my own thing,

56:37.328 --> 56:38.660
        but start small.

56:38.729 --> 56:42.064
      We just have to open
before Holly Hanson's re-opening

56:42.099 --> 56:43.699
 so everyone knows those recipes
     are mine, and not hers.

56:44.902 --> 56:46.268
      Maybe we could invite
       some food critics?

56:46.337 --> 56:47.569
          Food critics?

56:47.605 --> 56:48.437
   But you hate food critics.

56:50.741 --> 56:52.574
          Okay, great.
          It's perfect.

56:52.643 --> 56:53.575
              [Paul]: What days
              were you thinking?

56:53.644 --> 56:55.043
        [Nikki]: Let's do
        Valentine's Day.

56:59.350 --> 57:00.549
      This menu is perfect,

57:00.618 --> 57:01.350
      but I think we should
      supplement my recipes

57:01.385 --> 57:03.318
     with a few more dishes.

57:03.354 --> 57:04.353
                   What were you
                   thinking?

57:04.422 --> 57:05.954
            How about
   your heart-shaped ravioli?

57:07.358 --> 57:08.657
         You don't think
       that was too tacky?

57:08.726 --> 57:10.325
     I think it's romantic.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.043
            [Angela]:
    So we're all set to post

57:28.078 --> 57:30.512
  to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr,

57:30.548 --> 57:32.047
      The Patch, Reddit...

57:32.116 --> 57:33.549
        I've got a friend
        at "The Tribune"

57:33.617 --> 57:35.217
  who's going to blog about it,

57:35.252 --> 57:38.587
 and I've got some of the city's
   top food critics coming in.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.456
       They were scheduled
     to go to Holly Hanson's

57:40.491 --> 57:41.390
         for a tasting,

57:41.425 --> 57:42.825
      but I convinced them

57:42.893 --> 57:44.059
  that this was an extravaganza
    they didn't want to miss.

57:44.094 --> 57:45.928
            [laughs]

57:45.963 --> 57:46.895
      All I need is a name.

57:46.931 --> 57:47.629
        What are you guys
        going to call it?

57:47.698 --> 57:49.298
          How about...

57:49.366 --> 57:50.399
        "Nikki & Paul's?"

57:50.434 --> 57:51.600
        "Paul & Nikki's?"

57:52.770 --> 57:53.502
     That's not much better.

57:53.537 --> 57:55.037
             Hmm...

57:57.908 --> 57:59.241
            How about
      "Two Hearts Pop Up?"

58:00.411 --> 58:01.376
      "I Love You Pop Up?"

58:02.713 --> 58:05.614
       Valentine's Day...
       Valentine's Day...

58:05.649 --> 58:06.548
           [Paul]: What about...

58:06.617 --> 58:08.350
                   "Cafe Cupid?"

58:09.520 --> 58:11.320
Yeah, it's perfect.

58:11.355 --> 58:13.355
        Cafe Cupid it is.

58:19.763 --> 58:21.296
       Okay, so I have you
          down for two

58:21.365 --> 58:23.232
    on Valentine's Day night.

58:23.267 --> 58:25.667
           Yep, great.
       We'll see you then.

58:25.703 --> 58:27.169
           Okay, bye.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.572
Oh, my gosh...

58:30.608 --> 58:31.373
We just sold out!

58:31.408 --> 58:32.808
                    We sold out?

58:32.843 --> 58:35.010
  Yeah, we're completely booked
      for all three nights!

58:35.045 --> 58:35.911
           [laughing]

58:49.660 --> 58:50.993
               Sorry, this is...

58:52.830 --> 58:54.029
Not a good idea.

58:56.700 --> 58:59.568
                 And very
                 unprofessional.

58:59.603 --> 59:01.503
Unprofessional.

59:01.539 --> 59:03.205
         Yeah.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.073
           Don't want
another cayenne pepper incident.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.174
        [Angela]: Nikki!

59:06.210 --> 59:07.309
                           Yeah.

59:07.344 --> 59:08.677
             I think
    I hear Angela calling me.

59:08.712 --> 59:09.845
              Yeah.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.214
  Yeah, and I've got some work.

59:12.283 --> 59:13.215
                    Yeah.

59:14.285 --> 59:15.217
Nikki?

59:23.460 --> 59:24.326
For opening night.

59:31.135 --> 59:32.768
                      "To Nikki,

59:32.836 --> 59:34.536
    otherwise known as Chef.

59:35.606 --> 59:36.939
          Love, Paul."

59:47.651 --> 59:49.117
                         Thanks.

59:49.153 --> 59:50.852
           I love it.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.263
:
So you almost kissed?

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:02.664
          Yeah, almost.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.867
     Then it kind of turned
  into more of an awkward hug.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.736
What are you going
to do about it?

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.137
          Do about it?

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:11.006
         There's nothing
      to do about it, okay?

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:13.942
         Paul and I have
  a professional relationship.

01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:15.811
Oh, I don't buy that
for a minute.

01:00:15.846 --> 01:00:17.012
Ooh...

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.480
You've got to let
your walls down, Nikki.

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:20.616
I mean, give the guy a shot.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.417
     I just... I don't think
   we should cross that line.

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:24.086
      It's unprofessional.

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.921
     Oh, now you just sound
           like Holly.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:29.124
Lots of people who work
together fall in love.

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:30.726
           What, love?

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.394
 Look, you're only human, Nikki,

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:33.895
           and as much
      as you don't want to,

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:34.896
        it is inevitable

01:00:34.932 --> 01:00:37.265
          that you will
       fall in love again,

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:38.567
      He's probably falling
          for you, too.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:45.874
       Look, I appreciate
       the optimism, Ang,

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:47.609
                    I do, but...

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.810
             you and I both know

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:52.347
       I'm just not really
     relationship material.

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:54.750
   So... let's just drop this.

01:00:57.588 --> 01:00:59.421
        What do you think
         about this one?

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.756
Too plain.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:01.823
This is your big night.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:02.924
       You've got to make
          a statement.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.925
Oh...

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.163
        Now, this is what
       I'm talking about.

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.136
              Okay.

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.308
[Nikki]: Yeah, I'm so sorry
for the last-minute order,

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:21.610
but it's just...

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.311
well, we kind of threw
everything together.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:25.514
I mean, we only finalized
the menu last night,

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:26.682
but I guess
that's why they call it

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:27.849
a pop-up restaurant.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.317
               Of course, we can
               fill the order.

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.318
Where's it going
to be, again?

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:32.054
[Nikki]: Oh,
at Gus' Kitchen downtown.

01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:34.556
   Yeah, he's going to rent us
         all the space.

01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:35.590
                    [Marty]: Us?

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:37.059
       You have a partner?

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:39.895
           Well, yes.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.596
           It's Paul.

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:42.864
                  [Marty]: Paul?

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.500
     My Paul is going to be
      your cooking partner?

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:49.204
        Well, it's mainly
     going to be my recipes,

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:52.140
      but we are featuring
 a few of his originals as well.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:53.275
           Originals?

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.045
                So, you can take
                it from here?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.781
     Oh, you want to leave?

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.082
Yeah.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.487
     I'll see you tomorrow.

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.287
              Okay.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.223
Great work tonight.

01:08:52.863 --> 01:08:54.261
       What just happened?

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:57.398
                  Well, I, um...

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:00.001
                   earlier, I...

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:02.937
        Nikki, I need you
  to come out front right away.

01:09:03.006 --> 01:09:04.005
          It's urgent.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.508
          Nikki Turner
        stole my recipes.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.542
             Really?

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:08.977
She was my assistant,
and I fired her.

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:14.048
She must have invited you
to get some press

01:09:14.117 --> 01:09:16.484
         and to pretend
 that these are her new recipes.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.086
       Isn't that a shame?

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.687
  For someone to stoop so low,

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.823
to steal from someone?

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.194
          So, please...

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.264
   this menu will be featured
      at my new restaurant

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:31.533
when I open after my renovations
         are completed.

01:09:31.568 --> 01:09:33.868
       I hope you'll come
    and be my personal guest.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:35.370
              I'll be there.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.638
Thank you.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.975
   Two can play at your game,
            my dear.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:24.886
      I heard that you had
      a very successful evening.

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:26.421
It was successful...

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:27.889
  until Holly Hanson showed up.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.160
                 So, you're sure

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:34.862
 that you don't want the rental
    for tonight and tomorrow?

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:36.130
I would...

01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:38.199
but last night didn't exactly go
          as planned...

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:42.003
   and all of our reservations
    for tonight and tomorrow

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:43.471
         canceled, so...

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:48.142
  My whole reputation as a chef
 is shattered in just one night.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:52.880
   You know what I've learned
      over all these years?

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.619
            That a lie only runs

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.621
      until it's taken over
          by the truth.

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:01.155
         Thanks, Gus...

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:04.325
and thanks
for the deposit back.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:06.794
                  Not a problem.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:09.631
             You know that
             this place is yours

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.799
           any time you need it.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.271
            Bye, Gus.

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:44.699
         Not that I mind
   beating the pants off you,

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:46.467
        but maybe you ought
        to sit the next one out.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.102
       Your head's clearly
        not in the game.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:49.370
 My head is totally in the game,
         okay? Come on.

01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:53.107
            You know
    what bothers me the most?

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:54.642
            Oh, what?

01:11:54.678 --> 01:11:56.010
Is that she didn't respect me
enough to let me know,

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.045
   tell me that he was coming

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.046
     so I could be prepared,
            you know?

01:11:58.081 --> 01:11:59.314
     Oh, we're back to that?

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:00.448
       And did I tell you
  that she almost clobbered me

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:01.316
      with an iron skillet?

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:02.383
       About three times.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:03.351
Just shows you,
you should not get close

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:05.119
           to someone
       that you work with.

01:12:05.188 --> 01:12:06.721
       Well, Angela and I
         work together,

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:07.755
         and we're good.

01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.990
     So you're taking sides?

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:11.259
           Hey, I'm Switzerland.
           No side-taking...

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.328
            but I do think
            it was kind of lousy

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:14.629
            that you just walked
            out on her.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.130
       I mean, your timing
  just could have been better.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:17.732
   What are you talking about,
           my timing?

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:19.167
       Well, for starters,
       it was Valentine's Day...

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:22.103
       and second, Holly.

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:25.073
       Did I not tell you?

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.675
            Holly...

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:30.778
           she came by
    and had some conversation

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:32.413
    with the big food critic,
      right after you left.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:34.649
        Yeah, you forgot
        to tell me that.

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:36.017
      How could you forget
        to tell me that?

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:36.951
           I just did.

01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:40.088
    I didn't think she was going
    to close the place down.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.756
        Since you were partners,
        I figured you'd know.

01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:43.558
         I had no idea.

01:12:46.096 --> 01:12:48.196
     I mean, I was planning
on seeing her later for tonight.

01:12:48.231 --> 01:12:49.397
     Nope. She canceled it.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.667
 She must have been devastated.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.535
              She was. She is...

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:56.838
            but from
      what Angela tells me,

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:58.473
      having you mad at her
         about your dad

01:12:58.508 --> 01:12:59.841
     is equally devastating.

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:13.921
       [cell phone rings]

01:13:58.134 --> 01:13:59.133
                  Hey, Dad.

01:13:59.169 --> 01:14:00.501
Your mother's
in the back.

01:14:02.639 --> 01:14:04.472
            I, uh...

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:06.307
      actually, I came here
           to see you.

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:09.010
Look, if it's about
the other night...

01:14:09.078 --> 01:14:10.077
[interrupting] It's not entirely
     about the other night.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:11.579
  I just wanted to try your...

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.748
          [loudly] I'm trying
          to tell you something.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:14.949
              Fine.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:15.817
      Talk. I'm listening.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.053
    Don't you think it's time

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.121
        that we got over
     this silly little feud,

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.589
 and we could just move forward?

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.892
                It's what I came
                here to say.

01:14:26.663 --> 01:14:28.629
        I didn't realize
     how much it affected me

01:14:28.665 --> 01:14:29.664
      'til the other night,

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:30.998
         when I saw you
       at the restaurant,

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:32.700
            eating...

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:33.968
    something that I created.

01:14:36.606 --> 01:14:38.139
              Being a chef is
              what I am good at,

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:39.474
  and it's what makes me happy,

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:40.942
      and as much as I want
        to please you...

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:44.078
        I'm not a baker.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:46.581
        I never will be.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:47.715
The truth is...

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:50.551
        when you decided
     to go to chef's school,

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:51.552
    I felt like a failure...

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.556
like I did something wrong,

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.692
I let you down somehow.

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:02.997
  Listen, I know being a baker
 isn't as fancy as being a chef,

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:04.632
            but it's
    a respectable profession.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:05.533
      Don't you understand?

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:07.001
          It's not just
        your profession.

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:09.604
    You've taken your talent,

01:15:09.639 --> 01:15:10.471
      and you've turned it
          into an art.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:15.343
     You always wanted to be
     the best that you could be,

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:17.011
  and now you're the best baker
  that this city has ever seen.

01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:20.448
         Just like you,

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.884
        I just want to be
  the best chef that I can be.

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:24.919
And you are.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.855
      You proved that to me
        the other night.

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:29.724
         Matter of fact,
   I wanted to tell you then,

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:30.925
         but when I came
     to look for you after,

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:32.159
      you had already left.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:36.130
              Yeah.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:40.635
            I, uh...

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:43.871
      was upset with Nikki

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.506
        for inviting you
       without telling me.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:46.674
            [Trish]:
    She's a good girl, Paul.

01:15:46.743 --> 01:15:48.576
She had
the best intentions.

01:15:49.746 --> 01:15:50.745
              I know she is, Ma.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.046
And if you're mad at her

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:53.381
because of something
to do with us,

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.917
well, then you owe her
an apology.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:02.089
          I know I do,
 but she won't return my calls.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.259
She's right, you know.

01:16:05.328 --> 01:16:06.561
     Listen...

01:16:06.596 --> 01:16:09.163
Whenever I've done
something to upset your mom,

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:12.900
   I try to think of some way
       to make her smile.

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:14.368
          A gesture...

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:17.138
        a genuine gesture
         from the heart.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:18.873
        Goes a long way.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:22.610
          You're right.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:25.613
    You're absolutely right.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.416
                       Okay.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:31.586
                    Thanks, Dad.

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:52.139
             Henry.

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:53.507
            Thank you
     for coming to meet me.

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:54.475
       No problem at all.

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:58.713
      So, what did you want
      to talk to me about?

01:16:58.748 --> 01:17:00.815
I have some
interesting news

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:02.483
that you might find
hard to believe.

01:17:02.552 --> 01:17:03.884
          I'm all ears.

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:23.337
Why are you hiding
that newspaper?

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:25.072
  Because I'm your best friend
 and I'm trying to protect you.

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:27.908
           From what?

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.977
        There's a review
         of Cafe Cupid.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.045
     Well, what does it say?

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:34.015
         Nothing, Nikki.
  You don't want to read this.

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:34.882
           Yes, I do.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.219
            [Nikki]:
     "Nikki Turner's recipes

No, that won't be necessary.

          You have been
   such an inspiration to me.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.855
   As a young, aspiring chef,
       I looked up to you.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:53.994
       To me, Holly Hanson
  was a chef who had integrity

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:56.831
and fierceness
and originality.

01:18:59.702 --> 01:19:02.937
            You were,
   in every sense of the word,

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:03.804
           my idol...

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:09.910
but now
I know the truth...

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:12.379
that to achieve the success
that you've had,

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:16.884
  a chef has to be underhanded
         and dishonest,

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.320
      and that is a person
     I never want to become.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:23.290
  So, you can steal my recipes,

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:26.160
and you can destroy
my reputation...

01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:28.829
     but there is one thing
    that you will never take,

01:19:28.865 --> 01:19:30.464
     and that is my spirit.

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:33.434
         You might think
        that you've won,

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.237
 but I just need you to know...

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:37.671
    that you didn't beat me.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:52.680
          Look, I know
  I was wrong for blaming you.

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:53.681
      You were just trying
     to do the right thing,

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:55.082
