00:21.650 --> 00:27.714
I was just off the 16th green in two,
and he was buried in the bunker.

00:28.156 --> 00:31.182
Ginny's been working so hard
on the Junior League Charity Ball.

00:31.159 --> 00:33.821
- How marvelous.
- You've got to help with the committee.

00:34.162 --> 00:37.188
- Of course I will.
- You gonna be at the Goldwater rally?

00:37.165 --> 00:38.496
You bet. I wouldn't miss it.

00:38.667 --> 00:42.194
We went to Spain last summer, and
it's like an entirely different country.

00:44.172 --> 00:46.037
You see what Jackie Kennedy
was wearing?

00:46.174 --> 00:48.540
- Yes, I did.
- Wasn't it beautiful?

00:50.178 --> 00:54.478
Okay, everyone,
1963 is right around the corner.

00:54.683 --> 00:56.844
Grab that special someone you love.

00:56.685 --> 00:59.620
It all started on
New Year's Eve, 1962...

00:59.688 --> 01:02.657
...in mY hometown
of Pasadena, California...

01:03.191 --> 01:06.991
...when this man and this woman
slept together.

01:07.195 --> 01:11.529
He was 21, she was 42.

01:14.703 --> 01:16.398
Six months later,
the affair ended...

01:18.206 --> 01:20.106
...when the man
slept with someone else.

01:20.208 --> 01:24.508
Not just anY someone else,
the woman's onlY daughter.

01:24.713 --> 01:27.341
As if things needed
to get more complicated...

01:27.716 --> 01:31.618
...three daYs later, the daughter
married a different guY.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.154
No one was aware
of the bride's little fling.

01:34.222 --> 01:37.350
No one, that is, except her mother.

01:38.727 --> 01:41.423
That could have been the end
of the storY, but it wasn't.

01:43.231 --> 01:46.325
The following spring,
a book was published.

01:46.234 --> 01:48.725
The author was a classmate
of the Young man.

01:49.237 --> 01:51.228
Not the groom, the other one.

01:51.239 --> 01:53.935
You know, the one who slept
with mother and the daughter?

01:54.242 --> 01:55.573
Names were changed...

01:55.744 --> 02:00.545
...but that didn't stop all of Pasadena
from doing what it does best: Gossip.

02:00.749 --> 02:03.946
And with the Lindus boy too.
Her best friend's son.

02:03.752 --> 02:05.982
No, l... I heard it was Mary Beth...

02:06.254 --> 02:07.881
...with that Bianchi boy.

02:08.256 --> 02:10.247
But Mary Beth
doesn't have a daughter.

02:10.258 --> 02:14.388
No, but she has a homosexual son.

02:14.763 --> 02:18.927
Without anY prime suspects, however,
interest in the scandal quicklY faded.

02:18.767 --> 02:23.397
Guess who showed up
stewed last week at the Hunt Club.

02:24.272 --> 02:27.435
I don't feel the conservative
cause has been hurt. TwentY-five...

02:27.776 --> 02:30.506
It was, after all, onlY a book.

02:30.779 --> 02:33.441
Once again, this could have
been the end of the storY.

02:33.281 --> 02:37.650
But then, in 1967,
the movie came out.

02:38.286 --> 02:41.221
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson...

02:41.289 --> 02:44.281
...here we are, You got me into
Your house, give me a drink...

02:44.292 --> 02:47.318
...You put on music, now You start
opening up Your life to me...

02:47.796 --> 02:49.559
...tell me Your husband
won't be home.

02:49.297 --> 02:51.026
- So?
- Mrs. Robinson...

02:51.299 --> 02:53.267
...You're trYing to seduce me.

02:56.304 --> 02:58.169
Aren't You?

02:58.306 --> 03:01.571
Well, no, I hadn't thought of it.
I feel verY flattered...

03:01.810 --> 03:06.338
And that's how the deepest, darkest
secret of one Pasadena familY...

03:06.815 --> 03:08.806
...became immortalized.

03:09.818 --> 03:11.809
Ever since, people in town
have wondered...

03:11.820 --> 03:16.450
...who is the real Benjamin Braddock
and who is the real Mrs. Robinson.

03:17.325 --> 03:20.726
All this happened over 30 Years ago.

03:20.829 --> 03:23.354
So, what does this
have to do with me?

03:23.331 --> 03:26.391
To answer that,
You'd have to know who I was.

03:26.835 --> 03:28.894
Which, in the winter of 1997...

03:28.837 --> 03:31.431
...is something I mYself
was struggling with.

03:32.390 --> 03:36.520
Truth be known, I'd been struggling
with that mY whole life.

03:39.397 --> 03:41.331
Sarah?

03:41.399 --> 03:43.162
- Yoo-hoo, Sarah.
- Yeah?

03:43.401 --> 03:47.269
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

03:47.906 --> 03:51.467
- You don't seem fine.
- Oh, no. I'm fine. I am.

03:51.409 --> 03:53.570
Okay, fine.

03:54.913 --> 03:57.541
- What was that?
- Turbulence.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.749
That wasn't turbulence.
That felt mechanical.

04:00.919 --> 04:03.444
- That was textbook turbulence.
- L... Okay.

04:03.922 --> 04:07.187
You are not a pilot.
You do not know that.

04:07.425 --> 04:09.586
Since when did you
become afraid of flying?

04:09.928 --> 04:11.953
I'm not afraid of flying.
I love to fly.

04:11.930 --> 04:14.296
It's crashing that I hate.
I hate crashing.

04:14.432 --> 04:17.629
Baby, where...?
Where is your engagement ring?

04:18.435 --> 04:21.064
That's... It's in my...
It's in my purse.

04:21.439 --> 04:23.634
What's it doing in there?

04:23.441 --> 04:25.136
Well, you know...

04:25.443 --> 04:29.072
...how on planes your...
Your fingers get all swollen.

04:29.447 --> 04:31.176
Oh, really? I never heard that.

04:31.449 --> 04:34.475
Really? Yeah, they do.
They get swollen.

04:34.452 --> 04:36.477
And fat.

04:36.955 --> 04:40.220
But don't they sort of unswell
when you land?

04:40.959 --> 04:43.450
Yes. They do.

04:43.962 --> 04:46.123
- But I wasn't finished.
- Okay.

04:45.964 --> 04:47.397
I was also thinking...

04:47.966 --> 04:50.867
...this is Annie's wedding weekend,
you know?

04:50.969 --> 04:54.564
I don't think we should announce our
engagement and steal her thunder.

04:54.472 --> 04:57.305
- Why does it keep doing that?
- Because we're in an airplane.

04:57.475 --> 05:00.444
- Oh, God.
- You really need to calm down, honey.

05:01.479 --> 05:02.969
Wanna have sex in the bathroom?

05:03.481 --> 05:06.041
I was thinking
more like a hot cup of tea.

05:06.484 --> 05:09.009
- I'm serious.
- Baby, it's so cramped in there.

05:08.987 --> 05:11.785
- They got harsh lighting...
- Come on. It's gonna be good.

05:11.990 --> 05:14.015
Okay, just wait. Wait a little bit.

05:14.492 --> 05:16.790
Come, knock three times.
This is gonna be great.

05:16.995 --> 05:19.429
- Sarah.
- This is gonna be fun.

05:41.519 --> 05:43.419
I said, knock three times.

05:43.521 --> 05:46.456
- Want me to go out and do it again?
- No. No.

05:48.526 --> 05:50.016
Hi.

05:54.032 --> 05:55.966
Wait.

06:00.038 --> 06:02.768
- I'm sorry, you're squishing my arm.
- Sorry.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.940
- Shit.
- Let me just move over here, hold on.

06:06.544 --> 06:07.977
My arm... Damn it.

06:08.046 --> 06:10.446
- What? What?
- My shoe fell off. It's okay.

06:10.548 --> 06:12.072
- I'll get it later.
- Okay.

06:12.550 --> 06:15.519
You all right? Okay, let's...
Let's try again.

06:16.054 --> 06:17.419
Wait, now your knee's in my...

06:17.555 --> 06:19.648
Why don't you just turn.
Turn a little bit.

06:20.058 --> 06:22.219
- Sorry.
- No.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.051
Oh, no. No, no.

06:24.562 --> 06:26.427
Is that better?

06:27.565 --> 06:29.465
- Faucet.
- Okay.

06:29.567 --> 06:31.330
Is that better?

06:40.078 --> 06:41.875
- What?
- You're not into this.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.378
- What? I'm into it.
- You are so not into this.

06:44.582 --> 06:45.947
I'm into it.

06:46.084 --> 06:48.279
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:53.091 --> 06:54.149
God!

06:55.093 --> 06:56.754
Whoa, Jesus.

06:56.594 --> 06:59.222
- What, are you...?
- Okay, no, no, no. I'm being sucked.

06:59.597 --> 07:03.397
- And not in a good way.
- God. Sorry.

07:03.601 --> 07:05.796
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

07:06.104 --> 07:09.904
It's not that bad. I just...
Did I get any of that blue water on me?

07:10.108 --> 07:12.372
I've never even met the guy.

07:12.610 --> 07:16.444
- What? What guy?
- Annie's fiancÃ©.

07:17.115 --> 07:19.276
What kind of a maid of honor am I?

07:19.117 --> 07:21.017
What kind of a big sister am I?

07:21.119 --> 07:24.646
It's not like we have a mother who
helped her pick out her wedding dress.

07:25.123 --> 07:28.092
And got her something old and
something new and something...

07:28.626 --> 07:30.116
That blue thing.

07:30.128 --> 07:33.620
I don't think Annie is expecting you
to take the place of your mother.

07:33.631 --> 07:36.156
I don't know. I don't know.

07:36.634 --> 07:39.068
Listen, I hate to say this...

07:39.137 --> 07:43.096
...but you always get like this just before
you're going home to see your family.

07:44.142 --> 07:46.269
I do?

07:47.145 --> 07:48.976
I do.

07:49.647 --> 07:52.241
Because I don't fit in with them.

07:52.650 --> 07:54.242
I don't fit with anybody.

07:54.652 --> 07:56.847
You fit with me.

07:58.656 --> 08:00.521
Come here.

08:00.658 --> 08:02.387
Come on.

08:04.162 --> 08:05.993
You okay?

08:06.164 --> 08:08.496
I can go tell the pilot
to turn the plane around.

08:13.171 --> 08:15.469
So are we...?

08:15.673 --> 08:17.106
Are we through here?

08:18.176 --> 08:19.609
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got a plan.

08:19.677 --> 08:21.975
- Okay.
- You leave...

08:22.180 --> 08:25.638
...I'll wait here a few seconds,
maybe tidy up a little bit...

08:25.683 --> 08:28.049
...then I'll slip out very discreetly...

08:28.186 --> 08:30.916
...and pretend like I'm looking
for some more almonds.

08:31.189 --> 08:34.158
- Okay.
- Okay?

08:34.692 --> 08:36.489
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:37.695 --> 08:39.094
- Okay.
- You got it?

08:39.197 --> 08:42.860
- Yes.
- Okay. All right.

08:54.712 --> 08:57.909
- Hey, how you doing?
- I'm okay.

08:58.216 --> 09:01.242
- I was just... You know.
- Yeah.

09:01.219 --> 09:03.585
- Probably should go now.
- Yeah.

09:06.391 --> 09:08.518
- I tell you about the tunnels?
- The tunnels?

09:08.893 --> 09:10.690
There are tunnels
near Dodger Stadium.

09:10.895 --> 09:14.695
Ever since we were little, we'd hold
our breath as we drove through them.

09:14.899 --> 09:17.629
Now, my dad still thinks
that this is tremendous fun...

09:17.402 --> 09:20.064
...and he will unquestionably
try to involve you in it.

09:20.405 --> 09:21.770
- Yes.
- You don't have to...

09:21.906 --> 09:23.237
...certainly not for me.

09:23.408 --> 09:27.174
You know, I urge you not to, because
my dad drives like such an old lady...

09:27.412 --> 09:29.642
...getting through the tunnel,
you'll pass out.

09:29.914 --> 09:32.144
- Got it.
- Okay, now, tennis...

09:32.417 --> 09:34.442
...always a safe subject, always safe.

09:34.419 --> 09:37.013
Wine, good. You know,
any travel anecdotes...

09:37.422 --> 09:39.754
...especially Europe, really good.

09:39.924 --> 09:42.415
Don't bring up guns
or the death penalty...

09:42.427 --> 09:45.123
...and whatever you do,
do not bring up Vietnam.

09:45.430 --> 09:46.897
Why would I bring up Vietnam?

09:46.931 --> 09:49.695
On the other hand, he loves
talking about the Civil War...

09:49.934 --> 09:52.960
...Antietam and Shiloh.

09:53.438 --> 09:55.201
Relax, it's gonna be fine.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.431
I know. I'm saying,
in case you get stuck.

09:57.442 --> 10:00.275
I'm not gonna get stuck.
I'm a lawyer, I talk for a living.

10:00.445 --> 10:03.471
You're a very good lawyer.
If you get stuck, as a last resort...

10:03.448 --> 10:06.315
...talk about the Rams leaving L.A.
- Thank you very much.

10:06.451 --> 10:08.442
- Here they are. Here they are.
- Daddy. Hi.

10:08.953 --> 10:10.477
Hi, sweetheart.

10:10.455 --> 10:13.083
- Hi. How are you?
- Great.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.551
Daddy, this is Jeff.

10:15.460 --> 10:17.655
The guy you've been hiding?
Earl Huttinger.

10:17.962 --> 10:20.658
- Nice to meet you.
- What are your intentions with Sarah?

10:21.966 --> 10:25.493
I know one thing, I'd take her to
a Rams game if they were still in L.A.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.597
Oh, don't get me started on that.

10:28.473 --> 10:30.065
How can a professional league...

10:29.974 --> 10:32.875
...not have a team in the country's
second-largest market?

10:33.478 --> 10:35.446
The St. Louis Rams? What is that?

10:35.480 --> 10:37.948
I can't even say it.

10:39.984 --> 10:42.248
Dad, you are allowed
to go the speed limit.

10:42.487 --> 10:43.886
Here they come.

10:43.988 --> 10:46.354
- The tunnels.
- You heard about them?

10:46.491 --> 10:50.928
- Dad, can we please not...?
- On three. One, two...

10:57.001 --> 11:00.027
All right, that's...
You guys can stop now.

11:01.005 --> 11:03.997
Oh, come on, you guys.
What are you, like, 5 years old?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.600
Jeff? First time in Pasadena?

11:38.543 --> 11:40.477
- Yes, sir, it is.
- There's an old saying:

11:40.545 --> 11:43.309
"Nobody comes from L.A.,
everybody comes to L.A.

11:43.548 --> 11:47.609
But if you do come from Los Angeles,
then you probably come from Pasadena."

11:48.052 --> 11:52.182
Case in point, yours truly. Not to
mention my wife and, of course, Sarah.

11:53.558 --> 11:56.049
There's where Sarah first learned
how to ride a bike.

11:56.060 --> 11:59.461
There's the alley that Bobby Miller
told me I was ugly.

12:00.064 --> 12:01.861
- Jeff. Jeff.
- Yeah.

12:02.066 --> 12:05.467
- You fly-fish?
- No, I've never got a chance to do that.

12:05.570 --> 12:08.095
"Face like a butt," I believe,
is how he put it.

12:08.072 --> 12:11.530
This summer, I think I'm gonna go
to Idaho and fish the Big Wood River.

12:12.076 --> 12:14.010
- Sounds great.
- You wanna come with me?

12:14.078 --> 12:17.104
- Both you guys?
- There's the hedge I ran away to once.

12:17.081 --> 12:19.106
Wait. You ran away to a hedge?

12:19.584 --> 12:22.781
Yeah, I was 12.
That's as far as I got.

12:23.087 --> 12:25.078
She convinced herself
she was adopted.

12:25.089 --> 12:27.284
I hear the trout up there
are as big as Buicks.

12:38.970 --> 12:41.336
Oh, you're here, you're here,
you're here!

12:41.472 --> 12:43.736
I'm here.

12:44.976 --> 12:47.274
Annie, this is Jeff, my boyfriend.

12:47.478 --> 12:49.241
Hi.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.311
- You're cute. He's cute.
- So are you.

12:51.482 --> 12:54.747
- He is cute.
- My God, I'm getting married tomorrow!

12:54.986 --> 12:57.477
- To him.
- Baby, they're asking if we should...

12:57.488 --> 12:59.319
...have a second bar out on the patio?

12:59.490 --> 13:01.185
- Daddy?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

13:01.492 --> 13:03.585
You don't wanna kill me
before you get paid.

13:03.494 --> 13:05.052
Scott, this is my sister Sarah.

13:05.496 --> 13:07.987
- Hi, Scott.
- And her cute boyfriend Jeff.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.557
- How you doing?
- Good to meet you.

13:09.500 --> 13:13.061
We can't get Sterling roses for the
centerpieces. What about pink or white?

13:13.504 --> 13:14.937
Scott, you pick this one.

13:15.006 --> 13:16.735
- Pink.
- Let's go with white.

13:17.008 --> 13:18.339
White it is.

13:18.509 --> 13:21.171
So when are you guys
getting married?

13:22.013 --> 13:24.504
We haven't... We haven't
really talked about that yet.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.847
But you're such a great couple.
Aren't they?

13:27.018 --> 13:30.181
- Great couple.
- I need two strong men out here.

13:30.521 --> 13:32.421
Sure.

13:32.523 --> 13:35.424
Annie. How...?
Gosh, how are you feeling?

13:35.526 --> 13:37.721
- Great, great.
- Yeah? Scared?

13:38.029 --> 13:42.363
Scared? Of what? I mean, if I was
scared, why would I be getting married?

13:42.533 --> 13:44.865
- Well, I mean, people get scared...
- Look at you!

13:45.536 --> 13:49.199
Okay, do you want the bow clip
on the top or the ribbon on the bottom?

13:49.540 --> 13:51.235
Bow clip, ribbon...

13:51.042 --> 13:54.808
Bow clip. Bow clip. Definitely
bow clip, yeah. No, ribbon. Ribbon.

13:55.046 --> 13:57.480
- Wow, I don't know how you do all this.
- It's fun.

13:57.548 --> 13:59.880
Hey, I have a great idea.
Mixed doubles.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.452
I forgot my racket,
and Jeff doesn't really...

14:03.554 --> 14:06.318
- Come watch us play.
- We will when we settle in a bit.

14:06.557 --> 14:08.718
- No, sooner.
- Okay.

14:09.560 --> 14:12.927
My sister. She bounces.

14:14.065 --> 14:16.056
- So, what was that all about?
- What?

14:16.067 --> 14:19.264
You told your sister we've never
even talked about getting married.

14:19.570 --> 14:21.470
We agreed to announce
after the wedding.

14:21.572 --> 14:24.735
Yeah, announce. You make it
sound like I'm your fishing buddy.

14:25.076 --> 14:27.203
I'm sorry.
Just don't listen to anything...

14:27.078 --> 14:30.343
...I say for the next couple of days.
I get crazy around my family.

14:30.581 --> 14:32.242
Sarah.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.141
Are you getting cold feet?

14:34.585 --> 14:38.487
- Because if you are, you can tell me.
- No, no, I'm not getting cold feet.

14:38.589 --> 14:40.557
I have perfectly warm feet.

14:40.591 --> 14:42.183
Just warm?

14:42.093 --> 14:44.493
All right, they're hot.
I have very hot feet.

14:45.096 --> 14:47.030
Yes, you do have very hot feet.

14:47.098 --> 14:50.590
Except for that freaky
little baby toe of yours.

14:50.601 --> 14:54.628
All right, I'm in here.
Oh, but you're down the hall to the left.

14:55.106 --> 14:58.633
- Is that a joke?
- It's a Pasadena thing.

14:58.609 --> 15:01.169
What, they don't have sex
in Pasadena?

15:02.914 --> 15:06.850
A journalist.
Wouldn't your mother be proud.

15:06.918 --> 15:10.285
Well, actually, I write the...
The wedding announcements...

15:10.421 --> 15:12.116
...and the obituaries.

15:13.925 --> 15:16.416
How divine.

15:16.427 --> 15:18.395
You know, there's an old saying:

15:18.429 --> 15:20.954
"Nobody comes from Los Angeles...

15:21.432 --> 15:23.627
...they come to Los Angeles."

15:23.935 --> 15:27.666
"But if you do come from Los Angeles,
then chances are you come from..."

15:27.438 --> 15:29.702
- Pasadena?
- What, you heard it?

15:30.441 --> 15:34.241
Hey. You're here, you're here,
you're here!

15:34.445 --> 15:36.743
- You're gorgeous.
- Oh, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah.

15:36.948 --> 15:39.542
- This is Nikki, she's a bridesmaid too.
- Hi.

15:39.450 --> 15:42.578
I'm so excited. Aren't you excited?
I'm so excited I could scream.

15:43.454 --> 15:45.445
Go ahead.

15:46.457 --> 15:48.687
Okay, that's enough.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.690
All limestone. I know I may
be in for a heartbreak...

15:51.963 --> 15:55.296
...but I just can't stand
tumbled marble.

15:57.969 --> 15:59.937
Vodka, rocks, please.

16:00.471 --> 16:02.803
I'm sorry, but we've been asked
to tell guests...

16:02.974 --> 16:06.307
...to refrain from smoking in the house.
- Screw you.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.309
Grandma?

16:11.482 --> 16:14.417
I told you never to call me that
in public.

16:17.488 --> 16:19.956
Oh, it's so good to see you.

16:22.994 --> 16:25.155
You look sensational, kid.

16:27.498 --> 16:30.490
- On the hard stuff, huh?
- Oh, yeah. Well, you know:

16:30.501 --> 16:33.368
- "When in Pasadena..."
- Good point.

16:35.006 --> 16:37.531
- Get me an ashtray while you're at it.
- Yes, ma'am.

16:37.508 --> 16:40.238
So how's the journalistic career?

16:41.012 --> 16:42.479
Well...

16:42.513 --> 16:44.378
...it's...
- You know, I still pick up...

16:44.515 --> 16:48.679
...the paper every day to read your
obituaries. I'm thrilled I'm not in it yet.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.887
It's nice to know I still have
loyal readers out there.

16:52.023 --> 16:54.082
Lawyer boy? Is it working out?

16:54.525 --> 16:56.117
That's... It's okay.

16:56.027 --> 16:58.257
We're... Yeah, we're okay.
I guess it's...

16:58.529 --> 17:00.053
- It's okay.
- That good, huh?

17:00.531 --> 17:03.659
No. It's good, it's good.
We're good. It's...

17:03.534 --> 17:06.435
- It's just...
- Come on, everybody. Dinner's ready.

17:06.537 --> 17:09.300
- Come on.
- You'll tell me everything after dinner.

17:09.540 --> 17:13.101
We'll be drunk then, so I'll expect dirt.

17:14.045 --> 17:16.638
Like how he proposed to me
last week and I said yes...

17:17.048 --> 17:19.743
...and my head has been
in a fog ever since?

17:19.550 --> 17:21.711
Outside. Now.

17:22.053 --> 17:25.386
I have been to Pasadena before.
I was stationed here during the war...

17:25.556 --> 17:28.650
...at an internment camp
just down the block.

17:29.060 --> 17:33.292
Oh, gosh. You know, don't get me
wrong, Jeff is an amazing guy.

17:33.564 --> 17:36.260
It's just, when he asked me
to marry him...

17:36.067 --> 17:38.763
...I didn't feel what I think
you're supposed to feel.

17:39.070 --> 17:40.765
I just felt...

17:41.072 --> 17:43.973
- What?
- Terrified.

17:44.075 --> 17:46.270
- That's why you said yes?
- I don't know why.

17:46.577 --> 17:48.044
No, I mean, I do know. L...

17:48.079 --> 17:50.639
He's smart and he's funny and he's...

17:51.082 --> 17:52.879
He's the best boyfriend I ever had.

17:53.084 --> 17:55.484
That sounds awful.
No wonder you're so terrified.

17:55.586 --> 17:59.716
No, it's me. It's me, it's all me.
And... And that.

18:03.094 --> 18:06.461
That's Pasadena. That's what happens
when you give people everything...

18:06.597 --> 18:10.055
...and leave them alone for 100 years.
- I just want my life to be full.

18:10.101 --> 18:12.262
I want some adventure, you know?
And...

18:12.603 --> 18:15.299
How did you feel before Grandpa
asked you to marry him?

18:15.606 --> 18:17.198
I threw up.

18:17.108 --> 18:19.440
Probably because I was pregnant
with your mother.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.601
You were pregnant?

18:22.113 --> 18:24.343
Is that why you married him?

18:25.616 --> 18:27.481
Listen, kiddo...

18:27.618 --> 18:29.882
...I am clearly not an expert on love.

18:30.621 --> 18:35.149
And I didn't exactly love your
grandfather, God rest his pickled soul.

18:35.126 --> 18:37.754
But we had something.
And I can tell you this...

18:38.129 --> 18:40.962
...if you love the guy,
that's something to hang onto.

18:41.132 --> 18:45.159
I don't know, I guess I feel that
when you... If you get married, that's it.

18:45.136 --> 18:48.128
You know? You just have
a bunch of kids and...

18:48.139 --> 18:50.004
You make it sound like
a death sentence.

18:50.641 --> 18:52.973
- Well, it was for my mom.
- No, it wasn't.

18:53.144 --> 18:55.578
Your mother did not get sick
from her wedding vows.

18:55.646 --> 18:58.376
I don't know, I just, you know...

18:58.649 --> 19:00.617
I just...

19:00.651 --> 19:02.380
- You want more out of life.
- Yes.

19:02.653 --> 19:04.450
Get in line, kid.

19:05.156 --> 19:06.953
Hey, Mr. H. Seen Sarah?

19:07.158 --> 19:08.489
No.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.957
- What you doing?
- I make a toast.

19:11.162 --> 19:13.562
- A little nervous, you know.
- Oh, you'll be fine.

19:13.664 --> 19:16.599
I wish the girls' mother was here.
She always put me at ease.

19:17.168 --> 19:20.626
- What would she do?
- Just give me a hug.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.700
What the hell are you doing?

19:29.046 --> 19:32.209
In fact, I think it's normal
for you to feel horrible...

19:32.550 --> 19:35.280
...at a time like this.
Your mother did the same thing.

19:35.553 --> 19:37.885
Before she married your father,
she was just...

19:40.057 --> 19:42.958
In fact, she went MIA a week
before the wedding.

19:44.562 --> 19:45.927
She did?

19:48.065 --> 19:50.590
I should never drink this stuff
without a mixer.

19:50.568 --> 19:52.866
Come on, introduce me
to the lucky guy.

19:53.070 --> 19:56.335
- I'm freezing my nuts off out here.
- Wait. Mom went missing?

19:56.574 --> 19:58.565
Well, she just took off to think.

19:58.576 --> 20:00.567
- Took off where?
- I don't remember.

20:01.078 --> 20:04.479
- Cabo San Lucas, maybe.
- Cabo. Why would she go to Cabo?

20:04.582 --> 20:06.607
You don't think
there was somebody else?

20:07.084 --> 20:09.279
No. She just went away.

20:09.086 --> 20:12.317
For your father's sake, we never
discussed this at family dinners.

20:13.090 --> 20:16.287
The point is, you shouldn't
let yourself worry about this thing.

20:16.093 --> 20:18.823
If you don't wanna marry
the guy, don't. If you do, do.

20:19.096 --> 20:21.155
If the marriage implodes, divorce.

20:21.599 --> 20:24.159
You haven't lived till
you've been through one of those.

20:24.101 --> 20:26.228
- Well, thank you, Grandma.
- Happy to help.

20:27.104 --> 20:29.698
Oh, Jeff. This is my...

20:30.107 --> 20:31.836
Katharine, my mother's mother.

20:32.109 --> 20:34.805
Hello. You don't look like a lawyer.

20:34.612 --> 20:37.308
Thanks. You don't look like
a grandmother.

20:37.615 --> 20:40.584
You are a lawyer. Full of shit.

20:50.127 --> 20:52.391
Playing the trombone.

21:00.137 --> 21:02.731
There are certain moments in time...

21:02.640 --> 21:06.337
...that stick with you forever,
no matter how senile you get.

21:07.645 --> 21:10.478
For me, there's...

21:10.648 --> 21:13.082
...June 25th, 1963.

21:13.150 --> 21:15.482
The day I married Jocelyn.

21:16.654 --> 21:19.316
And, of course,
the birth of both my daughters.

21:20.658 --> 21:23.786
Then there's the day that Annie
accidentally ate a bug in one...

21:23.661 --> 21:26.221
Well, your parents
didn't waste much time.

21:26.664 --> 21:30.122
- What?
- They were married June 25th, 1963...

21:30.167 --> 21:31.828
...you were born March 3rd, '64.

21:32.169 --> 21:34.569
They didn't waste much time
getting pregnant.

21:34.672 --> 21:36.572
You never did the math?

21:36.674 --> 21:39.871
You were born eight months and
a week after they got married...

21:40.177 --> 21:42.407
...which means either
you arrived early or...

21:42.680 --> 21:45.706
...somebody slipped one past the goalie,
you know what I mean?

21:45.683 --> 21:49.016
That's my Annie. One smile,
and the whole world melts.

21:50.688 --> 21:53.122
- I have to admit...
- I don't... I don't think so.

21:53.691 --> 21:56.319
- It was the '60s.
- It was the early '60s.

21:56.193 --> 22:01.529
Your mom probably didn't even know she
was pregnant till after the honeymoon.

22:04.201 --> 22:06.396
- Okay, you've gotta tell me.
- What?

22:06.704 --> 22:08.968
Did Mom sleep with someone
before marrying Dad?

22:09.206 --> 22:10.537
What? You've got to tell me.

22:10.708 --> 22:13.233
What's the matter with you?
The Caldwells are hearing.

22:13.210 --> 22:15.201
Did Mom have an affair in Cabo
or not?

22:15.713 --> 22:18.443
- How could I possibly know?
- Because you know everything.

22:18.716 --> 22:21.344
I would like to make a toast
to the happy couple.

22:23.721 --> 22:25.985
To Annie and Scott.

22:27.224 --> 22:29.590
Life is short...

22:29.727 --> 22:32.025
...but marriage is long.

22:33.731 --> 22:35.790
So drink up...

22:35.733 --> 22:39.066
...and it'll make it go
a hell of a lot faster.

22:56.253 --> 22:58.448
- Hi.
- I hope you're not thinking...

22:58.756 --> 23:00.690
...of breaking
the Pasadena no-sex rule.

23:00.758 --> 23:03.318
- Can I get in?
- You can always get in.

23:03.761 --> 23:06.594
- What are you doing?
- Going over the indemnity provision...

23:06.764 --> 23:11.292
...of this asset-transfer agreement,
and I was kind of getting turned on...

23:11.268 --> 23:13.600
...so lucky for me,
a hot, single girl showed up.

23:13.771 --> 23:16.399
- I just know that she did it.
- Did what? Whom?

23:16.774 --> 23:19.106
My mom had an affair
before her marriage.

23:19.276 --> 23:22.609
No, what if it's true?
If she had a fling and got pregnant...

23:22.780 --> 23:26.272
...it explains everything. Why I have
nothing in common with my family...

23:26.283 --> 23:28.342
...why I hate tennis,
why I'm not blonder.

23:28.786 --> 23:31.448
- Am I overthinking this?
- You're not underthinking it.

23:31.288 --> 23:34.416
- God, I'm losing my mind.
- No, baby, you're not losing your mind.

23:34.792 --> 23:36.783
You're just having a pre-midlife crisis.

23:36.794 --> 23:39.058
It's actually kind of cute.
It's charming.

23:39.596 --> 23:41.757
- God, I wonder if my dad knows.
- Please...

23:42.099 --> 23:45.068
I can't ask him. If he doesn't know,
it would kill him.

23:45.102 --> 23:47.127
Please, Sarah.

23:47.104 --> 23:48.537
I bet my Aunt Mitsy knows.

23:50.607 --> 23:54.373
- There's an Aunt Mitsy?
- Yeah. She was my mom's best friend.

23:54.111 --> 23:55.738
- I should go see her.
- You should.

23:56.113 --> 23:57.944
First we should break the house rules.

23:58.115 --> 24:00.675
Tomorrow I'm gonna go see
my Aunt Mitsy.

24:14.631 --> 24:16.496
Hair of the dog.

24:17.134 --> 24:19.625
So, Aunt Mitsy,
apparently Mom disappeared...

24:20.137 --> 24:22.662
...a week before the wedding
to think.

24:24.141 --> 24:26.701
Gosh, I don't remember that.

24:27.144 --> 24:30.272
Do you remember any men she may
have been associated with then?

24:30.647 --> 24:32.911
You make this sound
like a police investigation.

24:32.649 --> 24:37.313
"No, officer. The only man your mom
ever had eyes for was your father."

24:38.155 --> 24:40.146
And Beau Burroughs.

24:41.158 --> 24:42.625
Who?

24:43.160 --> 24:45.128
Beau Burroughs.

24:46.163 --> 24:48.358
He was a year ahead of us in prep.

24:48.665 --> 24:50.758
Your mother and I
were just gaga for him.

24:51.168 --> 24:52.863
You wanna see a picture?

24:55.172 --> 24:57.970
That's your mom
and me in Our Town.

24:58.175 --> 25:00.905
Or The Importance of Being Earnest.
I can't tell.

25:01.178 --> 25:05.478
She was a good actress.
Shame she gave it up.

25:05.682 --> 25:09.880
"All women become like their mothers.
That is their tragedy.

25:10.187 --> 25:13.623
No man does. That's his."

25:15.192 --> 25:18.355
- So Beau Burroughs?
- Oh, right.

25:21.698 --> 25:23.290
There he is.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.794
Look at that face.

25:28.705 --> 25:30.468
Did she go out with him?

25:30.207 --> 25:32.869
Dated a little. Beau was not
the steady-boyfriend type.

25:33.210 --> 25:35.644
He had lots of girlfriends.

25:36.213 --> 25:37.737
You?

25:38.215 --> 25:40.740
After college, very casually.

25:40.717 --> 25:44.175
I invited him to your mom's wedding,
but your grandmother pooh-poohed it.

25:44.221 --> 25:46.815
Said an ex-beau at a wedding
was bad luck.

25:47.224 --> 25:49.249
"Ex-Beau."

25:52.729 --> 25:57.098
There he is with Charlie Webb.
I forgot those two were friends.

25:57.734 --> 25:59.497
My drink needs freshening.

25:59.736 --> 26:02.398
- Yours?
- No. I'm... I'm driving.

26:02.239 --> 26:05.436
Charlie Webb. Why...?
Why does that name sound familiar?

26:05.742 --> 26:08.074
He was the big celebrity
from that class.

26:08.245 --> 26:11.271
You know. He wrote that book
that caused all that flap.

26:11.248 --> 26:13.182
The...

26:17.254 --> 26:18.653
What?

26:20.257 --> 26:22.589
When did Katharine say your mom...?

26:23.260 --> 26:24.921
Right before the wedding.

26:27.764 --> 26:30.358
Did she say she went to Mexico?

26:31.768 --> 26:33.258
Cabo.

26:37.941 --> 26:41.775
Charles Webb. Charles Webb.

26:42.946 --> 26:46.473
Wait. Aunt Mitsy, what book
did you say that he wro...?

27:03.467 --> 27:06.698
- Hello.
- Hi. I need you to do something for me.

27:06.970 --> 27:09.632
Where are you?
Everyone's ready to go to the church.

27:09.973 --> 27:13.807
I need you to go to the video store
and get me a copy of The Graduate.

27:13.977 --> 27:15.376
- What?
- The Graduate.

27:15.479 --> 27:17.879
- That movie with Dustin Hoffman in it.
- Why?

27:17.981 --> 27:21.280
- Sarah, what is going on?
- Well, honey, I can't explain right now.

27:21.485 --> 27:24.477
Everyone's waiting in the limo.
I can't go down there and ask...

27:24.988 --> 27:28.355
Please just do it. Please.
I'll meet you at the church.

27:31.495 --> 27:34.760
Oh, sorry. My bad, my bad.

27:48.011 --> 27:50.241
- Sarah.
- Yeah. Come in.

27:50.514 --> 27:51.947
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

27:52.015 --> 27:53.812
I had to go to two different stores.

27:54.017 --> 27:56.417
There it is! "Based on the novel
by Charles Webb."

27:57.020 --> 27:58.851
- You should be out there.
- You've seen this?

27:59.022 --> 28:01.422
- Yes, a few times.
- Do you think there's a TV here?

28:01.525 --> 28:03.516
- Are priests allowed to watch TV?
- Sarah.

28:03.527 --> 28:05.757
Okay. You know,
everyone has always said...

28:06.029 --> 28:09.226
...that this is based on a real thing
in Pasadena.

28:09.533 --> 28:13.264
That someone in town, some family,
were the real Robinsons.

28:13.036 --> 28:15.834
It's my family, Jeff.
We are the Robinsons.

28:16.039 --> 28:19.202
- Are you listening to yourself?
- Webb went to prep with my mom...

28:19.543 --> 28:21.704
...he was best friends
with Beau Burroughs...

28:22.045 --> 28:23.603
...who I think she ran off with.

28:23.547 --> 28:25.515
- Beau Burroughs?
- Yes. And...

28:26.049 --> 28:29.712
...Dustin Hoffman's character in
The Graduate was Benjamin Braddock.

28:30.053 --> 28:32.851
Benjamin Braddock, Beau Burroughs.
"B.B." Get it?

28:33.056 --> 28:35.047
Benjamin Braddock,
Beau Burroughs: B.B.

28:35.559 --> 28:37.857
- I got it.
- Oh, my God. I mean, my mom...

28:38.061 --> 28:40.086
...ran off with this guy,
got pregnant...

28:40.063 --> 28:43.760
...and then came back to marry my dad.
- Maybe got pregnant.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.864
I mean, was she in love with this guy?

28:46.069 --> 28:48.264
And if she was,
why would she come back?

28:48.572 --> 28:50.802
And why has no one
ever told me about this?

28:51.074 --> 28:54.407
Most of all
You have to hide it from the kids...

28:57.581 --> 28:59.708
What are you two talking about
in here?

28:59.583 --> 29:03.417
- The wedding is about to begin.
- You're Anne Bancroft, aren't you?

29:03.587 --> 29:05.350
You're Mrs. Robinson.

29:07.090 --> 29:08.284
Jeff.

29:08.592 --> 29:12.153
- Go play with your dick.
- I can do that.

29:14.598 --> 29:16.361
Are you?

29:16.600 --> 29:19.000
Mom liked Beau Burroughs,
you seduced him...

29:19.102 --> 29:21.696
...then she ran off with him
a week before the wedding.

29:21.605 --> 29:24.130
Don't believe everything
you see in the movies.

29:24.608 --> 29:26.701
Is that a yes?

29:32.115 --> 29:34.606
For what it's worth,
I thought that Mrs. Robinson...

29:34.618 --> 29:37.849
...was the most interesting character
in the film.

29:38.622 --> 29:42.649
Did that seduction scene really play
like that in real life, or was that a...?

29:42.626 --> 29:44.059
You, don't talk.

29:44.127 --> 29:48.587
Dearly beloved, we have come
together in the presence of God...

29:49.132 --> 29:51.965
...and before this company
of friends...

29:52.135 --> 29:55.161
...to witness and bless
the joining together...

29:55.138 --> 30:00.007
...of Annie and Scott
in holy matrimony.

30:00.143 --> 30:05.274
The union of husband and wife
in body, mind and spirit...

30:05.649 --> 30:09.915
...is intended by God
for their mutual joy...

30:10.153 --> 30:16.183
...for help and comfort given one
another in adversity and prosperity...

30:16.159 --> 30:20.687
...and with the sense of responsibility
for this fragile Earth...

30:20.664 --> 30:22.996
...our island home.

30:27.504 --> 30:29.836
Pasadena, the number
for a Beau Burroughs.

30:30.006 --> 30:33.908
Baby, a guy like that wouldn't
still be living in Pasadena.

30:34.010 --> 30:36.604
No. That... Beau Burroughs.
That's two R's.

30:37.013 --> 30:40.608
Jesus. Could you have done any
more shopping while we were here?

30:41.017 --> 30:43.815
Okay. Well, could you
try Los Angeles, please?

30:44.020 --> 30:46.250
I'll be waiting in the car.

30:51.027 --> 30:53.154
All right. Thank you.

31:12.549 --> 31:14.915
Hey, there you are.

31:15.051 --> 31:19.385
Scott's taking me to brunch at the Hunt
Club, so I just wanted to say goodbye.

31:21.558 --> 31:23.992
Mom always had the softest hands.

31:26.062 --> 31:29.122
Yeah. Yeah, she was beautiful.

31:31.067 --> 31:33.160
She was.

31:33.570 --> 31:35.094
She really was.

31:38.074 --> 31:40.542
I can't believe I'm married.

31:42.078 --> 31:45.445
I can't believe you're married either.
I really can't believe it.

31:45.582 --> 31:49.040
It was the strangest thing. I woke up
and I looked over at Scott...

31:49.085 --> 31:53.021
...and it was like...
Like I was looking at somebody else.

31:54.090 --> 31:57.253
Well, how...?
How did that make you feel?

31:58.094 --> 32:00.289
Well, I just realized that,
you know, I'm...

32:00.597 --> 32:03.361
Now I'm Mrs. Somebody Else.
Isn't that cool?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.864
- Honey?
- I'll be right there.

32:06.102 --> 32:08.127
- Oh, I love you so much.
- I love you too.

32:08.605 --> 32:10.505
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

32:10.607 --> 32:13.371
Oh, I'm married, I'm married,
I'm married.

32:15.612 --> 32:18.376
Even if we get an expansion team,
it's still not the Rams.

32:18.615 --> 32:21.914
Besides, it takes at least three years
to even be competitive.

32:22.118 --> 32:24.109
With free agency
the way it is today...

32:24.621 --> 32:26.714
...you can buy a contender
out of the gate.

32:26.623 --> 32:28.887
Before you know it,
you'll kick the Rams' butts.

32:29.125 --> 32:33.061
I like the way you think.
Hang onto this one. He's a keeper.

32:33.129 --> 32:35.495
Are you okay?
You've been awfully quiet.

32:35.632 --> 32:38.294
Yeah. I'm just tired.
It's a long weekend.

32:38.635 --> 32:40.603
- But a great weekend.
- Yeah.

32:41.638 --> 32:43.697
- Okay, guys. Fly safe.
- We will.

32:44.140 --> 32:45.607
- Earl.
- Call me from New York.

32:45.642 --> 32:47.041
- I will. Thank you.
- Okay.

32:47.143 --> 32:49.509
- Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

32:52.148 --> 32:54.139
- Can I borrow your phone?
- Find anything?

32:54.150 --> 32:57.119
No, they were closed.
I wanna try again.

32:57.654 --> 32:59.849
Hi. Hi, my name is Sarah Huttinger.

33:00.156 --> 33:02.989
I'm an alumna of the class of '82. Hi.

33:03.159 --> 33:05.821
Yes. I'm looking for an address
or a phone number...

33:05.662 --> 33:10.122
...of a member of the class of '59,
a Beau Burroughs.

33:11.668 --> 33:15.399
So he's speaking at this conference
in San Francisco tonight.

33:15.672 --> 33:18.436
You're unbelievable.
How did you find all that out?

33:18.675 --> 33:21.109
- I called his office and they told me.
- Genius.

33:21.177 --> 33:24.578
So you're gonna just walk up to him
and ask him point-blank?

33:24.681 --> 33:28.139
I guess I could walk in and yell
"Hey, Dad," see if he turns around.

33:28.685 --> 33:30.312
Yeah.

33:30.687 --> 33:33.918
- Am I crazy to do this?
- A little. Want me to come?

33:34.190 --> 33:36.158
You can't come.
You've got that meeting.

33:36.192 --> 33:40.526
Believe it or not, Chase Manhattan will
continue to exist with or without me.

33:40.697 --> 33:43.689
No, if I'm gonna do this,
I have to do this on my own.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.033
You know, I never told you this,
but they based a movie on my family.

33:47.203 --> 33:51.196
Seriously. Titanic. They changed it
a little. There's no boat, nothing sank...

33:51.708 --> 33:55.269
...but I did pose naked
for a portrait once.

33:55.211 --> 33:57.611
Okay, here. Take this.

33:57.714 --> 34:00.205
Use that from San Francisco.

34:01.217 --> 34:03.310
You sure you don't want me to...?

34:03.219 --> 34:05.084
Thanks.

34:06.723 --> 34:09.521
Go find him. Stop being confused.

34:15.732 --> 34:19.132
Remember, I don't care
who gives you away.

34:27.744 --> 34:31.235
Oh, Jeff. I have your phone.

34:33.750 --> 34:37.708
Okay. "Well, hello, Mr. Burroughs.

34:38.254 --> 34:40.313
I think you might be my dad."

34:40.290 --> 34:43.315
We've heard a lot today
about revolution.

34:43.293 --> 34:46.489
The coming information revolution.

34:46.795 --> 34:50.254
The coming Internet revolution.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.667
You know, Che Guevara, he used to...

34:53.803 --> 34:57.034
He used to describe revolution
as a turn of the heart.

34:57.307 --> 35:00.435
He'd tap his rebels on the chest...

35:00.810 --> 35:02.539
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:02.812 --> 35:07.181
This conference is only
for registered participants and the press.

35:07.317 --> 35:09.979
Oh, I am press. I'm the press.

35:10.820 --> 35:13.721
Che, as you know,
was trained as a doctor.

35:13.823 --> 35:16.815
And when a man of science
speaks in such figurative terms...

35:16.826 --> 35:19.693
...one wonders exactly
what he has in mind.

35:19.829 --> 35:23.094
As something of a dilettante
Che biographer, I have my own theory.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.166
I think he was talking about
something he'd seen...

35:26.336 --> 35:29.362
...perhaps many, many times
in his life:

35:29.839 --> 35:32.865
The mystery of recovery.

35:33.343 --> 35:37.905
That moment when a patient decides,
despite everything, to live.

35:37.847 --> 35:42.284
To overcome his suffering
and will himself back to health.

35:42.352 --> 35:44.183
That was a revolution to Che.

35:44.854 --> 35:49.416
A willing of the unimaginable
into existence.

35:50.360 --> 35:55.593
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Internet revolution, it isn't coming.

35:55.865 --> 35:58.163
It has arrived.

36:03.873 --> 36:07.434
But once it's in the computer, it's...

36:07.377 --> 36:09.937
We just secured
the domain name Lobster. Com.

36:10.380 --> 36:14.407
Virally, you could market it in stealth
mode, or you can do both.

36:14.384 --> 36:17.683
I got this from very high up.
AOL and Time Warner are talking merger.

36:17.887 --> 36:19.286
It's gonna change the world.

36:19.389 --> 36:22.517
Caleus Tech is the third
multibillion-dollar company...

36:22.892 --> 36:26.225
...that you've created, taken public
and sold in less than 10 years.

36:26.396 --> 36:28.796
Do you have a problem
with commitment?

36:28.898 --> 36:31.526
Well, there's two schools of thought
on that one, John.

36:31.401 --> 36:34.768
I mean, first, some people think
that my attention span's too short...

36:35.405 --> 36:39.899
...for a day-to-day manager, that I'm
only interested in the launch, the action.

36:39.909 --> 36:42.742
And the second school
of thought is...

36:43.913 --> 36:45.938
What was the question?

36:45.915 --> 36:47.906
So, what's next?

36:48.418 --> 36:52.218
What's... Ms. Huttinger,
how are things in New York?

36:52.422 --> 36:55.414
Always happy to have the Gray Lady
represented. Any questions?

36:57.427 --> 37:00.658
- Not just yet.
- Beau, I need you for a minute.

37:00.930 --> 37:02.830
- Will it wait?
- Afraid not.

37:03.433 --> 37:05.458
I apologize.

37:05.435 --> 37:07.562
- Ms. Huttinger.
- I'm sorry.

37:07.937 --> 37:12.431
This is huge. It's the search engine
to end all search engines.

37:12.442 --> 37:15.843
I've been dealing with Ken Patterson
on this. I've been pounding him.

37:16.446 --> 37:18.914
- And?
- And he's agreed to give up 30 percent...

37:18.948 --> 37:21.314
...of the company for 100 million.

37:21.451 --> 37:24.750
Both Goldman and Morgan Stanley
are drooling to take this public.

37:24.954 --> 37:26.649
Ms. Huttinger.

37:26.956 --> 37:28.719
Excuse me.

37:28.458 --> 37:31.393
When you have a moment,
could I speak to you?

37:31.961 --> 37:33.292
- Of course.
- Beau.

37:33.463 --> 37:35.124
I'm not interested, Roger.

37:34.964 --> 37:36.955
How can I help you?

37:37.467 --> 37:41.369
I have a question
I would like to ask you.

37:41.471 --> 37:44.804
Beau, your 100
will be 2 billion in 18 months.

37:44.974 --> 37:46.532
Sarah Huttinger, Roger McManus.

37:46.476 --> 37:50.970
Roger's one of the most powerful men in
this conversation which has just ended.

37:51.481 --> 37:54.314
Roger, I'm out.

37:54.484 --> 37:56.111
Okay.

37:55.985 --> 37:57.316
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

37:57.487 --> 37:58.977
- Drink, sir?
- Yeah.

37:59.489 --> 38:01.548
- Okay.
- Thank you.

38:01.491 --> 38:05.120
So, Ms. Huttinger,
is this on the record or off?

38:05.495 --> 38:09.090
Off. Oh, off, off. Yeah, I'm not here
in a professional capacity.

38:09.499 --> 38:13.230
- Good.
- No. No, no.

38:15.004 --> 38:16.335
See...

38:19.008 --> 38:23.445
My mother was Jocelyn Richelieu.

38:25.014 --> 38:26.777
You're Jocy's daughter.

38:28.017 --> 38:29.814
Yeah.

38:31.521 --> 38:33.318
I mean, you've...

38:37.527 --> 38:40.690
Hey, I'm real sorry about your mom.

38:41.030 --> 38:43.396
You must have been...

38:43.533 --> 38:44.761
...very young.

38:46.035 --> 38:47.696
Yeah, I was 9.

38:48.538 --> 38:50.836
She was a good lady.

38:57.046 --> 38:58.741
So you're a journalist now.

39:01.050 --> 39:03.018
In a... In a manner of speaking.

39:03.052 --> 39:06.317
But I do have questions
that I would like to ask you.

39:06.556 --> 39:07.887
About?

39:08.057 --> 39:11.515
About what happened back then.

39:12.061 --> 39:14.552
Between your mother and me?

39:15.565 --> 39:18.363
And you and my grandmother.

39:19.569 --> 39:23.005
I also know about the book.

39:23.072 --> 39:25.438
And the movie.

39:27.577 --> 39:30.341
You have anywhere
you need to be right now?

39:35.585 --> 39:38.850
So you've read the book...

39:39.088 --> 39:41.386
...seen the movie.

39:42.091 --> 39:44.559
Pretty much how it was.

39:44.594 --> 39:47.062
They did take some creative liberties,
though.

39:47.096 --> 39:50.554
I didn't exactly graduate
from college...

39:50.600 --> 39:54.627
...but I suppose The Dropout
would've made a lousy title.

39:55.104 --> 39:59.803
And the ending, obviously
I did not run off with your mother.

40:04.113 --> 40:07.446
Your purse is ringing.

40:08.618 --> 40:10.347
- Do you mind if I...?
- No.

40:12.121 --> 40:13.554
- Hello.
- Hello.

40:14.123 --> 40:15.715
Hi. I have your phone.

40:15.625 --> 40:18.856
Yes, I realized that when I called myself
and you answered.

40:19.128 --> 40:20.823
So I just landed. Where are you?

40:21.130 --> 40:22.859
- I'm here.
- Yes.

40:23.132 --> 40:24.861
With him.

40:26.636 --> 40:29.036
Listen, hey, if you need...
If you need my phone...

40:29.138 --> 40:31.902
...it's still in the charger
in my apartment. I just...

40:32.141 --> 40:34.871
Wait, wait, wait.
You're there with him right now?

40:35.144 --> 40:37.339
- Yes.
- Did you ask him?

40:38.147 --> 40:41.605
Not yet.
No, I'm kind of leading up to that.

40:41.651 --> 40:45.587
Why? Don't be scared.
Whatever happens, it's gonna be fine.

40:46.155 --> 40:48.214
Will You please call me
when You find out?

40:48.157 --> 40:49.715
Okay, I will.

40:50.159 --> 40:51.649
Bye.

40:55.164 --> 40:57.530
Sorry about that.

41:12.181 --> 41:14.172
Did you sleep with my mother?

41:15.685 --> 41:19.553
In Mexico, Cabo,
the week before the wedding?

41:21.190 --> 41:23.021
Yes.

41:25.695 --> 41:27.890
Did you wear a condom?

41:30.199 --> 41:34.829
Did l...? Why...?
Why would you possibly wanna...?

41:39.709 --> 41:41.199
Oh, no.

41:41.210 --> 41:43.974
I was born March 3rd, 1964...

41:44.213 --> 41:46.738
...just shy of nine months
after my parents' wedding.

41:46.716 --> 41:49.184
So it's a coin toss
between you and my father.

41:49.719 --> 41:52.153
And I don't look like him,
I don't vote like him...

41:52.221 --> 41:54.746
...I don't drive like him.
And I think that maybe...

41:54.724 --> 41:57.852
Sarah, Sarah, I'm sorry
that this didn't occur to me before...

41:58.227 --> 42:00.559
...that you might be thinking this.

42:00.730 --> 42:03.460
No, it's possible.
Even if you used one, it is possible.

42:03.733 --> 42:05.223
- No, it's not.
- Of course it is.

42:05.234 --> 42:07.532
- It's not possible.
- Condoms break all the time.

42:07.737 --> 42:11.229
- They slip right off. Especially if you...
- Sarah, it's impossible...

42:11.240 --> 42:12.935
...for me to father children.

42:13.242 --> 42:15.506
What...? Are you sterile?

42:15.745 --> 42:17.508
- Great speech, Beau.
- Yeah, nice job.

42:17.747 --> 42:20.739
Very inspirational. Thank you.

42:24.754 --> 42:26.517
Yes.

42:27.757 --> 42:30.089
But maybe not 30 years ago.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.990
Thirty-nine, to be exact.

42:34.263 --> 42:36.458
Well, how do you...?
How do you know that?

42:37.767 --> 42:41.965
- Blunt testicular trauma.
- What?

42:42.772 --> 42:46.105
My junior year at prep,
I was goalie on our soccer team.

42:46.275 --> 42:50.541
We're in the city finals, tie score,
this guy comes in all alone.

42:50.780 --> 42:56.741
I go out to break up the play,
and just as his leg swung back, I dove.

42:57.286 --> 43:00.414
And let's just say that...

43:00.289 --> 43:03.087
...he kicked the wrong ball.

43:04.794 --> 43:08.230
Blunt testicular...

43:08.798 --> 43:11.028
- Trauma.
...trauma.

43:11.801 --> 43:14.201
And that made you sterile.

43:14.303 --> 43:15.861
I'm afraid so.

43:17.306 --> 43:23.267
Sarah, I'm... I'm sorry,
I can't be your father.

43:25.815 --> 43:27.407
Okay.

43:29.318 --> 43:30.910
Thank you.

43:34.323 --> 43:37.588
It was nice to meet you,
Mr. Burroughs.

43:37.827 --> 43:40.660
It was nice meeting you,
Ms. Huttinger.

43:40.830 --> 43:42.491
Goodbye.

43:46.836 --> 43:52.240
Blunt testicular trauma.

44:17.366 --> 44:19.834
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:20.369 --> 44:22.064
Yeah, no, I'm good.

44:22.371 --> 44:26.330
Everything... Everything's
very clear to me now.

44:26.375 --> 44:29.867
You know, I came up here
looking for answers, and I got them.

44:29.879 --> 44:31.904
I have nothing in common
with my family...

44:32.381 --> 44:35.179
...and yet they are my family,
which is great.

44:34.884 --> 44:36.818
This is good.

44:37.386 --> 44:40.844
My mom ran off to Cabo and had a fling
a week before she was married...

44:40.890 --> 44:43.882
...and then went back into
a loveless marriage, which was...

44:43.893 --> 44:47.659
That's her choice. It's fine. It's fine.

44:48.397 --> 44:50.558
Now I just... Now I gotta deal
with the fact...

44:50.900 --> 44:54.768
...that I am in a career
that is going absolutely nowhere.

44:54.904 --> 44:58.169
And a guy who is terrific,
and he wants to marry me...

44:58.407 --> 45:03.970
...and I, theoretically,
want to marry him.

45:05.915 --> 45:08.406
So yeah.

45:08.918 --> 45:10.647
It's good.

45:12.922 --> 45:16.483
It's pretty good, right?

45:18.427 --> 45:23.729
God, this... God, you know,
it's just a great city, huh?

45:33.943 --> 45:35.843
Sarah.

45:36.946 --> 45:39.039
- Sarah...
- I'm so sorry.

45:38.948 --> 45:43.385
No, no. Oh, no, no. No, that...
That... Hey, that's okay.

45:43.953 --> 45:47.753
- I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do...
- That's okay. That's... Look...

45:47.957 --> 45:52.155
- I don't even know you...
- Hey, it's gonna be all right.

45:51.961 --> 45:54.930
It's gonna be all right. Okay?

45:55.464 --> 45:57.022
Okay.

45:58.968 --> 46:01.300
- God!
- Come on.

46:01.470 --> 46:05.907
Let's... Let's cheer you up, okay?

46:05.975 --> 46:08.000
Cheer you up?

46:15.985 --> 46:20.615
- Hey, is that an actual elephant's tusk?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.

46:20.990 --> 46:23.049
- See all those little etchings?
- Yeah.

46:22.992 --> 46:25.256
You know how they say
elephants never forget?

46:25.494 --> 46:27.962
- Right.
- Not true. They have it all written down.

46:28.998 --> 46:31.466
- Smart elephant.
- Hey, hey, wait!

46:31.500 --> 46:33.331
Sarah, I have an idea.
You go with me?

46:33.502 --> 46:34.833
- Okay.
- A little longer?

46:35.004 --> 46:36.471
Yeah.

46:37.506 --> 46:39.701
You know, Sarah,
You're not the first person...

46:40.009 --> 46:42.637
...to harbor anxieties
about their future.

46:42.511 --> 46:45.036
I was literallY the poster boY
for that sort of thing.

46:45.514 --> 46:50.850
- Well, how did you figure yourself out?
- Well, I screwed up a lot.

46:51.020 --> 46:52.681
Lived abroad a while.

46:53.022 --> 46:55.547
Did an enormous amount of drugs.

46:55.524 --> 46:57.719
Joined an ashram.

46:58.027 --> 47:00.222
Doodled Grandma.

47:04.033 --> 47:09.733
Then someone told me the most
profound two words I'd ever heard:

47:10.039 --> 47:12.371
"Be present."

47:13.042 --> 47:16.409
So now all I ever worry about
is my immediate universe...

47:16.545 --> 47:19.844
...which presently consists
of you, me...

47:20.049 --> 47:22.813
...and the deafening silence
coming from that jukebox.

47:23.052 --> 47:26.044
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is mY privilege to introduce to You...

47:26.055 --> 47:30.583
...the president of the United States,
William Jefferson Clinton.

47:31.060 --> 47:33.187
Thank You verY much.

47:33.562 --> 47:35.427
Do you know him?

47:36.065 --> 47:38.590
You know, I'm not sure
anyone really knows him.

47:38.567 --> 47:41.297
I've spent time with him.

47:44.573 --> 47:46.666
Where are we going?

48:02.091 --> 48:04.525
Can I ask you a question?

48:06.095 --> 48:08.962
What happened that weekend
with Mom?

48:10.099 --> 48:12.294
Skipping all the intimate details,
of course...

48:12.601 --> 48:15.126
...but what happened
that weekend in Cabo?

48:17.106 --> 48:21.099
My parents had a house down there.

48:21.610 --> 48:24.511
I'm staying by myself, pretty much
loafing the summer away...

48:25.114 --> 48:26.206
...when Jocelyn...

48:27.116 --> 48:30.984
When your mom just showed up.

48:31.120 --> 48:34.487
We had a little history together
back in high school.

48:36.625 --> 48:40.254
For three days, all we did
was swim and laugh...

48:40.629 --> 48:42.256
...and I taught her how to surf.

48:42.631 --> 48:48.797
Then one morning I woke up
and she was gone.

48:49.138 --> 48:52.005
Back to Pasadena to get married. L...

48:54.143 --> 48:57.340
I didn't even know
that she was engaged.

49:01.150 --> 49:05.553
Those were probably
the three happiest days of my life.

49:06.655 --> 49:10.489
It's the only time I can remember
ever feeling really...

49:10.659 --> 49:12.957
...peaceful.

49:13.662 --> 49:16.529
Well, why do you think
that she went back?

49:17.666 --> 49:20.362
Security, maybe. I don't know.
She never said.

49:27.676 --> 49:30.076
You know, I can see a lot of her
in you.

49:31.180 --> 49:34.547
She was a very beautiful woman.

49:37.686 --> 49:39.551
So are you.

49:46.195 --> 49:48.163
I have to pee.

50:16.692 --> 50:18.319
What?

50:27.202 --> 50:28.260
Sorry.

50:28.203 --> 50:29.966
Okay.

50:31.707 --> 50:33.038
Well...

50:40.716 --> 50:42.115
Oh, I'm so sorry.

50:43.218 --> 50:46.051
I'm sorry.
I can't believe I just did that.

50:46.221 --> 50:49.213
So inappropriate. I didn't...
I mean, I re...

52:36.331 --> 52:37.662
Good morning.

52:39.334 --> 52:40.858
Morning.

52:40.836 --> 52:43.327
Best hangover remedy I know.

52:43.839 --> 52:45.966
Five minutes
with your feet over your head...

52:45.841 --> 52:48.309
...followed by a three-mile jog,
then a quick swim.

52:48.844 --> 52:51.142
It's better than coffee and aspirin.
Wanna try?

52:53.849 --> 52:55.714
You want coffee and aspirin.

53:03.859 --> 53:06.953
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

53:14.870 --> 53:16.565
Good coffee.

53:17.372 --> 53:18.839
Thank you.

53:18.874 --> 53:20.967
You're welcome.

53:26.381 --> 53:28.713
Where are we?

53:28.884 --> 53:34.516
We are in Half Moon Bay.
It's about a hour south of the city.

53:34.890 --> 53:36.915
San Francisco.

53:38.894 --> 53:40.725
- Anything else I can get you?
- No.

53:40.896 --> 53:45.094
- Sure? Eggs? Orange juice? Paramedics?
- Yeah.

53:49.905 --> 53:52.999
Well, I guess I'd better go.

53:53.408 --> 53:56.468
It was really nice to meet you,
Mr. Burroughs.

53:56.411 --> 53:58.845
It was very nice meeting you,
Ms. Huttinger.

54:00.916 --> 54:02.349
Well. Okay.

54:03.418 --> 54:05.045
Goodbye.

54:17.609 --> 54:19.804
I don't have a car here, do I?

54:20.111 --> 54:21.476
Nope.

54:23.114 --> 54:25.082
Would you...? Would you mind
giving me a...?

54:25.116 --> 54:28.677
Sure. But let's...
Let's grab a bite to eat first.

54:33.841 --> 54:36.674
I need to say something to you.

54:38.846 --> 54:42.282
What you told me last night
about your life in New York...

54:42.850 --> 54:45.148
...your job, the guy...

54:45.853 --> 54:49.846
...suggested that it wasn't anything
to rush back to.

54:51.359 --> 54:57.195
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say...

54:57.365 --> 55:02.598
Look, I realize it's a bit awkward,
given, well, everything.

55:02.870 --> 55:05.737
But last night, it was...

55:05.873 --> 55:09.070
Last night was
pretty spectacular for me.

55:09.377 --> 55:12.540
What I'm saying, Sarah...
What I'm trying to say, Sarah...

55:12.880 --> 55:18.284
...is that I like you.
Very much, I suspect.

55:18.386 --> 55:23.255
And I'd like you to stay
if you felt like you could.

55:23.891 --> 55:25.483
Stay?

55:25.893 --> 55:28.760
Yeah, as in not go.

55:30.398 --> 55:34.664
- You don't like the idea.
- Well, l...

55:34.902 --> 55:38.030
I don't... I just sort of...

55:38.906 --> 55:42.637
- I thought we were going to eat.
- We are.

55:43.411 --> 55:47.074
- Good morning, Mr. Burroughs.
- Good morning.

55:48.916 --> 55:51.714
It's just a quick trip
up to the Wine Country and back.

55:52.420 --> 55:55.981
Well, do I even have a choice
in the matter?

55:58.426 --> 56:00.417
So, what do you think?

56:00.428 --> 56:04.956
I think I would feel safer if that guy
was sitting up here instead of me.

56:07.435 --> 56:09.596
You think I'm too old for you,
don't you?

56:09.937 --> 56:11.495
No.

56:12.940 --> 56:14.874
Then?

56:14.942 --> 56:17.911
You've... You've slept with my mother
and my grandmother.

56:18.446 --> 56:22.542
- What's your point?
- My point... I mean, l...

56:22.950 --> 56:25.145
This is not normal.
I mean, you know...

56:24.952 --> 56:26.783
You know what,
you are too old for me.

56:26.954 --> 56:29.889
I mean, obviously
I am very confused right now...

56:30.458 --> 56:33.825
...and last night was some sort of,
I don't know, rite of passage.

56:33.961 --> 56:37.055
Maybe every girl in my family
has to sleep with you.

56:36.964 --> 56:42.163
Well, I don't know if they have to,
but they certainly have.

57:45.533 --> 57:49.560
- Beau Burroughs' office.
- Hi, this is Jeff Daly again.

57:49.537 --> 57:51.528
- I'm sorry, who am I talking to?
- Candace.

57:51.539 --> 57:54.337
Hi, Candace.
Listen, can you tell me where he is?

57:54.542 --> 57:55.873
I really need to reach him.

57:56.043 --> 57:58.136
I'm sorrY.
I can't give out that information.

57:58.546 --> 58:00.537
I know, Candace.
You told me that before...

58:00.548 --> 58:02.243
...but this is kind of an emergency.

58:02.550 --> 58:05.781
I'm looking for my fiancÃ©e.
She's supposed to be with him.

58:06.053 --> 58:10.046
I haven't heard from her. I'm starting
to feel like something happened to her.

58:11.559 --> 58:14.392
At some point I have to get back.

58:14.562 --> 58:19.659
I know. I gotta get back myself.
I got this ball to go to.

58:19.567 --> 58:22.559
A ball? People still go to balls?

58:23.070 --> 58:26.733
They do to this one.
It's the biggest charity event of the year.

58:26.574 --> 58:28.804
It's Casablanca Night.

58:32.580 --> 58:34.445
Why don't you come with me.

58:34.582 --> 58:37.608
- No. L... No, I can't. I can't.
- Why?

58:38.085 --> 58:39.416
- Why?
- No, sorry.

58:39.587 --> 58:41.248
I've got work. I've gotta go back.

58:41.088 --> 58:43.454
You know, I can't have people
dying anonymously...

58:43.591 --> 58:47.049
...while I'm off dancing
at some fabulous, exciting ball.

58:47.595 --> 58:49.927
- All right. Let me make a proposal.
- Oh, boy.

58:50.097 --> 58:52.292
Why don't you come with me tonight.

58:52.099 --> 58:54.590
After the party, I'll fly you home.

58:55.102 --> 58:57.332
Really. I have to be
on the East Coast anyway.

58:57.605 --> 58:59.869
I can just stop
and drop you off in New York.

58:59.607 --> 59:02.906
It'd be no hassle,
and you'll be there by morning.

59:07.114 --> 59:10.606
I know this must seem nuts to you,
but life should be a little nuts.

59:10.618 --> 59:15.021
Otherwise, it's just a bunch of
Thursdays, you know, strung together.

59:36.510 --> 59:38.137
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

59:50.024 --> 59:52.049
Okay, who else?

59:52.526 --> 59:54.118
Okay.

59:55.029 --> 59:57.054
You see that guy with the combover?

59:57.531 --> 59:59.999
The one talking to the woman
with the back cleavage?

01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:03.662
Yeah. He owns half
of downtown San Francisco...

01:00:03.537 --> 01:00:06.597
...and the guy next to him,
he owns the other half.

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:10.010
Okay, how about the guy
with the George Hamilton tan?

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:14.241
That's George Hamilton.

01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:22.010
No, no, you're not gonna get me there.
I don't go to the movies anymore.

01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:24.889
It's all special effects.
All they do is blow things up.

01:00:25.059 --> 01:00:28.187
I know. They used to make movies
about real things, about people.

01:00:28.562 --> 01:00:29.927
- Not anymore.
- Like Chinatown.

01:00:30.064 --> 01:00:31.361
- Yes.
- Chinatown.

01:00:31.565 --> 01:00:33.931
- Now, that's a movie.
- Oh, I loved that movie.

01:00:34.068 --> 01:00:36.901
I didn't understand a thing
that happened, but I loved it.

01:00:37.571 --> 01:00:39.903
"My sister. My mother. My sister."

01:00:40.074 --> 01:00:42.201
How about Butch CassidY
and the Sundance Kid?

01:00:42.576 --> 01:00:46.876
- Is that a movie?
- Katharine Ross. I was in love with her.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:48.946
You wanna talk
about Katharine Ross?

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:51.574
The Graduate.

01:00:52.086 --> 01:00:54.919
- Was she drop-dead gorgeous or what?
- Hey, hey.

01:00:55.089 --> 01:00:58.786
Let me tell you something about
The Graduate that very few people know.

01:00:59.593 --> 01:01:02.721
It was Richard Dreyfuss' first movie.

01:01:03.597 --> 01:01:04.928
He had one line:

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:07.090
"Shall I get the cops?
I'll get the cops."

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:09.433
- Yes, that's right!
- He said it to Norman Fell...

01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:12.071
...the guy from Three's CompanY.
- That's right!

01:01:12.606 --> 01:01:14.267
In the boarding house, right?

01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:21.047
Come on, folks,
all money goes to charity.

01:01:22.116 --> 01:01:24.277
Winner, eight the hard way.

01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:42.432
Hey, Beau. Patterson's here.

01:01:42.636 --> 01:01:46.299
If you go over and talk to him, you could
close this thing in three minutes.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.505
- You remember Sarah Huttinger.
- Yes, hi.

01:01:48.642 --> 01:01:50.769
- Nice to see you.
- I'm really not interested.

01:01:50.644 --> 01:01:55.377
Three minutes. All right, three minutes.
It's 49 percent for 75 mil.

01:01:57.151 --> 01:01:59.142
Any chance we can get
controlling interest?

01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:00.916
No, that's a deal breaker.

01:02:01.655 --> 01:02:04.715
- We'll see. I'm sorry...
- Go, go, go. Go. Go.

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:07.923
- I'll be right back.
- It's fine.

01:02:32.153 --> 01:02:33.484
What's up?

01:02:36.157 --> 01:02:37.886
Hi.

01:02:41.662 --> 01:02:43.630
This your first Casablanca Night?

01:02:44.665 --> 01:02:46.189
Yeah.

01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:48.191
Cool.

01:02:54.175 --> 01:02:55.802
Is that your real hair color?

01:02:58.179 --> 01:03:00.147
- What?
- No, it's good.

01:03:00.181 --> 01:03:04.811
I mean, you know, it's silky and shiny.
You could be a good hair model.

01:03:06.187 --> 01:03:08.382
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:03:08.689 --> 01:03:10.987
- Wanna have sex?
- Excuse me?

01:03:11.192 --> 01:03:13.786
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:03:14.195 --> 01:03:15.924
I was looking for my father.

01:03:15.696 --> 01:03:19.655
This is supposed to be his table,
but I don't see him anywhere.

01:03:20.201 --> 01:03:24.638
So if he comes by, tell him
that Blake was here for me, would you?

01:03:24.705 --> 01:03:26.195
Well, who is your dad?

01:03:27.208 --> 01:03:29.142
Beau Burroughs.

01:03:31.212 --> 01:03:36.616
What? Wait... Wait just one... So, what...?
What are you...? What are you saying?

01:03:36.717 --> 01:03:40.744
That Beau... That you're...
That he's... You're... That you're...

01:03:41.222 --> 01:03:43.417
You're babbling.

01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:45.692
I thought he didn't have any children.

01:03:46.227 --> 01:03:48.161
He had at least one.

01:03:48.229 --> 01:03:50.220
Champagne guy.

01:03:51.232 --> 01:03:54.759
Okay. Okay.

01:03:54.735 --> 01:03:57.329
Just because he's not sterile...

01:03:57.738 --> 01:04:02.368
...does not mean
that I just had sex with my father.

01:04:04.745 --> 01:04:06.076
Oh, God.

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.842
No, God!

01:04:10.751 --> 01:04:13.345
- Oh, God!
- Hey, I'll bite.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:17.849
What was that?

01:04:20.761 --> 01:04:22.388
Are you okay?

01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:25.823
Hey, Pops.

01:04:27.268 --> 01:04:29.259
Blake. What...?

01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:33.433
Welcome back. I thought you were
coming home next week.

01:04:33.774 --> 01:04:37.073
No, today. I came home today.

01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:41.373
- Sarah, this is Blake. He's my...
- This is your son.

01:04:41.782 --> 01:04:45.274
- Right. He's in from Africa.
- No, it was Asia. I was in Asia, Dad.

01:04:45.286 --> 01:04:46.651
Asia, right.

01:04:47.288 --> 01:04:49.222
- We need to talk.
- I know.

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.848
- Alone.
- I know.

01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:53.055
- We need to talk alone right now.
- Okay.

01:04:54.295 --> 01:04:58.026
God! Blunt testicular trauma?

01:05:01.302 --> 01:05:03.065
Come on.

01:05:06.307 --> 01:05:09.003
You have a child! You have a son.
You are a sick man.

01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:10.936
This isn't The Graduate,
this is Deliverance!

01:05:11.312 --> 01:05:13.780
Calm down.
There is a simple explanation.

01:05:13.814 --> 01:05:15.679
Is he adopted?

01:05:17.818 --> 01:05:19.979
- No.
- Then you are a sick man.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.550
I am a sick woman.
We have done a very sick, sick thing!

01:05:22.823 --> 01:05:24.848
Blake is not my biological son.

01:05:24.825 --> 01:05:27.350
My God, I'm gonna need
so much therapy.

01:05:27.828 --> 01:05:29.921
- What did you just say?
- I said that Blake...

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.027
...is not my biological son,
nor is he adopted.

01:05:33.334 --> 01:05:36.201
My first wife, Cynthia,
wanted to have children of her own.

01:05:36.337 --> 01:05:40.740
I, of course, could not do that for her,
so we used an alternative method.

01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:42.240
- A donor.
- A donor?

01:05:42.843 --> 01:05:45.073
A donor. So technically
Blake is not my son...

01:05:44.845 --> 01:05:46.642
...but we chose never
to tell him that.

01:05:46.847 --> 01:05:48.974
I would appreciate
if you would do the same.

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:51.284
Of course I won't.

01:05:53.354 --> 01:05:55.322
But you're still sterile, right?

01:05:55.356 --> 01:05:58.416
No, l... I lied. I made up
this whole story...

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:01.055
...just so that I could have sex
with my own daughter.

01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:03.626
- All right.
- What kind of guy do you think I am?

01:06:03.864 --> 01:06:05.491
Okay, you...

01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:11.429
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I called you a sick man.

01:06:11.372 --> 01:06:13.840
You're not a sick man,
you're a very nice man.

01:06:17.378 --> 01:06:18.367
Thank you.

01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:25.916
And very charming.

01:06:26.587 --> 01:06:28.578
And generous.

01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:32.922
And smart.

01:06:33.594 --> 01:06:35.892
And accomplished.

01:06:42.102 --> 01:06:43.933
And a good pilot.

01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:50.577
Very handsome.

01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:56.446
Apology accepted.

01:07:07.628 --> 01:07:10.028
I hope that's not your father.

01:07:13.133 --> 01:07:15.101
Jeff, what are you doing here?

01:07:15.636 --> 01:07:18.628
I don't know. I thought something
might have happened to you...

01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.630
...but apparently
something happened to me.

01:07:21.141 --> 01:07:24.110
No, Jeff, wait. Jeff, wait.

01:07:24.144 --> 01:07:26.078
Jeff! Jeff, please wait. Jeff!

01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:28.910
- What? What?
- Okay, okay. That... That wasn't...

01:07:29.149 --> 01:07:31.310
That wasn't... I didn't kiss him.
He kissed me.

01:07:31.652 --> 01:07:33.176
Did you sleep with him?

01:07:33.654 --> 01:07:37.613
I didn't mean to.
I know. God, Jeff. I was so drunk.

01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:41.821
I don't remember anything. That's not
an excuse, but it's kind of an excuse.

01:07:41.662 --> 01:07:44.062
- Jeff, I love you.
- No! Don't say that.

01:07:44.665 --> 01:07:48.624
Don't you say that. Now, I don't know
what game we're playing...

01:07:48.669 --> 01:07:51.900
...but obviously this engagement
that you and I have entered into...

01:07:52.172 --> 01:07:54.299
...has absolutely no meaning to you.

01:07:55.676 --> 01:07:58.304
Jeff, I'm so scared.

01:07:58.679 --> 01:08:01.204
I'm tired of scared.

01:08:02.182 --> 01:08:05.242
No, Jeff, please.
Just please listen to me!

01:08:05.686 --> 01:08:07.677
- What?
- I know that you hate me right now.

01:08:07.688 --> 01:08:09.713
I hate me right now.
I'm... I'm insane.

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:15.093
It's like I'm possessed by this person
who's terrified and just screwed up.

01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:19.221
I know we're good together. You're
the only person I can be myself with.

01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:21.564
Even if I don't know
who the hell that is.

01:08:22.703 --> 01:08:25.501
Then marry me, Sarah, right now.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.303
Wrong answer.

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:21.758
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:09:25.432 --> 01:09:29.765
- Sarah.
- I found Beau Burroughs.

01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:33.337
I didn't know where else to go.

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:36.568
Come in, I'll put on a pot of bourbon.

01:09:39.446 --> 01:09:43.381
And I just stood there. I just stood
there and I let Jeff walk away.

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:46.145
I mean, why?
Why couldn't I say yes?

01:09:45.953 --> 01:09:49.116
- Grandma, what is wrong with me?
- There is nothing wrong with you.

01:09:49.456 --> 01:09:52.357
- And don't call me Grandma.
- Oh, I'm such a mess.

01:09:52.459 --> 01:09:54.791
You are not a mess.
You are a human being.

01:09:54.962 --> 01:09:57.988
And you made a mistake.
People make mistakes.

01:09:58.465 --> 01:10:01.593
Sometimes life is just...
Beau Burroughs!

01:10:01.468 --> 01:10:03.129
What the hell were you thinking?

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:06.166
- What were you thinking?
- I wasn't thinking!

01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:09.033
- Well, I wasn't thinking either!
- What was he thinking?

01:10:08.976 --> 01:10:11.308
- We know what he was thinking.
- It's not his fault.

01:10:11.478 --> 01:10:13.810
It is always his fault. Of course it is.

01:10:13.981 --> 01:10:18.145
- He is nothing but a horny bastard.
- Oh, it's me, Grandma, it's me.

01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:21.113
- Don't say that!
- Why not? It's the truth.

01:10:21.488 --> 01:10:25.015
- I'll say it again. It's me.
- It is not the truth. Hello.

01:10:24.992 --> 01:10:28.052
I have happiness staring me
right in the face, and what do I do?

01:10:27.995 --> 01:10:29.553
I stare right back at it.

01:10:30.497 --> 01:10:32.863
Katharine, I need some help.
Annie's hysterical.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.936
- Annie? Why? What happened?
- She had an anxiety attack on the plane.

01:10:37.004 --> 01:10:39.097
- And you know why?
- I don't know, why?

01:10:39.506 --> 01:10:41.997
- What? Are you talking to me?
- I'm talking to Sarah.

01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:44.102
Because I am my mother's daughter.

01:10:44.511 --> 01:10:46.138
- Sarah's there?
- Sarah's there?

01:10:46.513 --> 01:10:48.037
- Sarah's here.
- She wasn't happy.

01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:50.006
- Your mother was happy.
- She was not happy!

01:10:50.017 --> 01:10:53.214
She found out she was pregnant
and left the love of her life...

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.546
...to come back and have me.
- The love of her life?

01:10:57.024 --> 01:10:59.424
- This is my fault.
- I wanna talk to Sarah!

01:10:59.526 --> 01:11:01.858
- She wants to talk to Sarah.
- It's not your fault!

01:11:02.029 --> 01:11:04.589
- Yes, it is my fault.
- It is not. It is not!

01:11:04.531 --> 01:11:07.932
- Katharine.
- It is. I stole my mother's happiness.

01:11:08.535 --> 01:11:10.400
- Katharine!
- You did not!

01:11:10.537 --> 01:11:12.630
- I did, I did, I did, I did!
- Katharine!

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:16.600
Am I the only sane one here?

01:11:16.543 --> 01:11:18.909
- I wanna see Sarah.
- She wants to see Sarah.

01:11:19.046 --> 01:11:21.310
- Annie wants to see Sarah.
- Annie?

01:11:21.548 --> 01:11:24.415
- Sweetheart, maybe Grandma...
- I only wanna talk to Sarah!

01:11:24.551 --> 01:11:27.611
- She only wants to talk to Sarah!
- She wants to talk to Sarah!

01:11:28.055 --> 01:11:29.784
She wants to talk to me?

01:11:31.024 --> 01:11:32.958
- Hi. Annie okay?
- No. She's upstairs.

01:11:33.026 --> 01:11:36.086
We're making her favorite soup,
tomato with crackers. Want some?

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:39.624
- No, I'm okay.
- I thought she was in New York.

01:11:39.533 --> 01:11:43.128
She had a fight with Jeff
and she never got on the plane.

01:11:43.537 --> 01:11:46.335
Two days ago I thought
I had two happy daughters.

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.567
Things are never what they seem
with the women in this family.

01:11:58.051 --> 01:12:00.144
Annie?

01:12:00.053 --> 01:12:01.987
It's me.

01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:13.999
Annie. Honey.

01:12:16.069 --> 01:12:18.230
How well did you know Mom?

01:12:19.072 --> 01:12:21.233
What?

01:12:24.578 --> 01:12:27.046
I can't remember her.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.571
I was only 4.

01:12:30.584 --> 01:12:32.518
Was she happy?

01:12:34.087 --> 01:12:35.748
I don't know.

01:12:36.089 --> 01:12:38.956
She always looked so happy
in pictures.

01:12:41.094 --> 01:12:43.688
She married so young.

01:12:43.597 --> 01:12:46.293
I always thought that, you know,
if she was happy...

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.932
...then maybe I would be.

01:12:50.103 --> 01:12:52.162
Honey, what happened on the plane?

01:12:54.107 --> 01:12:56.507
I just stopped breathing.

01:12:57.611 --> 01:13:00.409
We were over the Gulf of Mexico
on the way to Belize...

01:13:00.614 --> 01:13:04.380
...and I just stopped.

01:13:05.619 --> 01:13:08.986
I kept thinking
that I've ruined my life...

01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:13.149
...that I've married someone I like to
play tennis with, and that's all I'll do.

01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:15.526
And I couldn't breathe.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:18.894
I know the feeling.

01:13:20.634 --> 01:13:22.795
Oh, God.

01:13:23.637 --> 01:13:25.969
Annie, let me ask you a question.

01:13:26.139 --> 01:13:29.233
When you and Scott play tennis...

01:13:29.142 --> 01:13:33.044
...do you guys have fun?
- Yeah.

01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:37.173
When you guys go out to dinner?

01:13:39.653 --> 01:13:42.781
Yeah. When you watch TV?

01:13:43.657 --> 01:13:46.251
- We like The NannY.
- NannY's funny.

01:13:50.163 --> 01:13:52.723
Honey, sometimes I just think
it's more important...

01:13:52.666 --> 01:13:55.692
...who we're with
than what we're doing.

01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.969
And if you're gonna marry someone,
it may as well be your best friend.

01:14:01.174 --> 01:14:03.802
Yeah, like you are with Jeff?

01:14:05.178 --> 01:14:06.839
Yeah.

01:14:07.681 --> 01:14:09.148
Yeah.

01:14:11.184 --> 01:14:13.414
Oh, I'm such a mess.

01:14:13.687 --> 01:14:16.656
I'm the most screwed-up person
in the world.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:19.955
You're not even the most
screwed-up person in this room.

01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:21.524
Oh, really?

01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:26.029
I spent the first night of my honeymoon
in the Houston airport under sedation.

01:14:26.199 --> 01:14:27.996
Oh, yeah?

01:14:28.702 --> 01:14:33.571
Well, did you sleep with a man who also
slept with Mom and Grandma Katharine?

01:14:34.207 --> 01:14:36.266
What?

01:14:37.711 --> 01:14:41.545
You slept with Dad?
Dad slept with Grandma Katharine?

01:14:41.715 --> 01:14:45.583
Oh, God. No, God, come on,
even I'm not that twisted.

01:14:46.219 --> 01:14:50.087
All right. From the beginning.
And don't leave out a thing.

01:14:50.223 --> 01:14:53.215
No, the Xanax is for my
other granddaughter.

01:14:53.226 --> 01:14:56.753
We're talking about Sarah here,
the one from New York.

01:14:56.730 --> 01:15:01.064
Well, she broke up with her boyfriend.
She needs something stronger.

01:15:01.234 --> 01:15:02.997
Fine. I'll hold.

01:15:03.236 --> 01:15:05.602
Here. You're on hold.

01:15:20.253 --> 01:15:22.721
Son of a bitch.

01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:48.372
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:01.727
Hello, Katharine.

01:16:02.295 --> 01:16:04.729
You're looking well.

01:16:04.798 --> 01:16:06.425
Go shit in your shoes.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:09.701
Mrs. Richelieu, are
you trying to seduce me?

01:16:10.303 --> 01:16:12.328
You weren't that good the first time.

01:16:14.808 --> 01:16:17.402
How dare you? Sarah?

01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:19.642
You couldn't stop with Jocelyn,
could you?

01:16:19.813 --> 01:16:21.804
You almost ruined my daughter's life.

01:16:23.817 --> 01:16:25.648
- Wait a minute, Katharine.
- Get down.

01:16:26.319 --> 01:16:28.287
Hold on, Katharine.

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:30.312
Ruin her life?

01:16:31.825 --> 01:16:34.623
What movie are you living in now,
Katharine?

01:16:34.828 --> 01:16:37.991
I didn't pursue Jocelyn,
I don't recall inviting her to Cabo.

01:16:38.331 --> 01:16:41.858
And I didn't pursue your granddaughter.
She managed to come 500 miles...

01:16:41.835 --> 01:16:44.497
...up to San Francisco on her own
looking for me.

01:16:44.838 --> 01:16:48.797
And we both know that I sure as hell
did not pursue you.

01:16:50.343 --> 01:16:51.776
I know.

01:16:52.345 --> 01:16:53.869
I know.

01:16:58.852 --> 01:17:01.412
How come we've never
talked like this before?

01:17:01.855 --> 01:17:03.686
I don't know.

01:17:03.857 --> 01:17:05.586
I've always wanted to.

01:17:06.359 --> 01:17:08.088
Me too.

01:17:09.362 --> 01:17:11.296
- I love you, Annie.
- I love you too.

01:17:16.369 --> 01:17:18.337
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:17:18.872 --> 01:17:20.533
- It's him.
- Who him?

01:17:20.373 --> 01:17:22.841
- "Him" him!
- "Him" him?

01:17:23.376 --> 01:17:27.244
Just stop. I mean, this isn't about
Sarah. And it isn't about Jocelyn, is it?

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.543
- This is about you.
- You're goddamn right it is.

01:17:30.383 --> 01:17:33.477
You dropped me. You dropped me
for a newer model.

01:17:33.887 --> 01:17:36.720
Do you know how old
that made me feel?

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:38.585
And you realize,
when you did that...

01:17:38.892 --> 01:17:42.419
...that I was 13 years younger
than you are now.

01:17:42.896 --> 01:17:45.228
I don't know, Katharine.
I haven't done the math.

01:17:45.398 --> 01:17:47.730
I suppose everyone
needs someone in their life...

01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:51.598
...to let them know when youth
has come to an end.

01:17:53.406 --> 01:17:54.896
And here she is.

01:17:54.908 --> 01:17:57.206
It's your turn.

01:17:58.411 --> 01:18:00.538
- Are you okay?
- She's fine.

01:18:00.914 --> 01:18:03.075
Is she happy to see me too?

01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:05.407
Beau, you should not
have come down here.

01:18:05.919 --> 01:18:08.444
Why not?
He's been everywhere else.

01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:10.889
So, what's going on out here?
Lawn party?

01:18:11.424 --> 01:18:13.289
- Earl.
- Daddy...

01:18:13.426 --> 01:18:17.294
This is... This is Beau Burroughs.
He was a schoolmate of Jocelyn's.

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:20.365
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know you.
Beau Burroughs.

01:18:21.434 --> 01:18:23.231
- I've never forgiven you.
- Okay, Dad...

01:18:23.436 --> 01:18:26.303
No, no. This man haunts my dreams.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.876
City soccer final, playing
Pasadena Prep, tie score.

01:18:30.944 --> 01:18:34.277
I make it around the last defender,
I'm flying down the field...

01:18:34.447 --> 01:18:38.474
...to kick the winning goal.
All of a sudden, this maniac...

01:18:38.952 --> 01:18:42.444
- That was you?
- You broke my heart.

01:18:42.455 --> 01:18:44.855
But I gotta give it to you,
hell of a save.

01:18:46.459 --> 01:18:50.088
- You were injured, weren't you?
- Yeah.

01:18:50.463 --> 01:18:53.432
What are we standing here for?
You wanna come in the house?

01:18:53.466 --> 01:18:56.435
No, thanks. I was...
I just stopped by.

01:18:56.469 --> 01:18:59.302
Sarah, could I have a word
with you out at the car?

01:19:03.977 --> 01:19:06.445
- It was nice seeing you, Katharine.
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:10.780
It's wonderful catching up
on old times.

01:19:11.985 --> 01:19:13.509
Earl.

01:19:13.987 --> 01:19:15.682
Hell of a save.

01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:37.107
Why did you come down here, Beau?

01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:41.772
Well, for one thing, you left last night
without saying goodbye.

01:19:42.215 --> 01:19:44.115
I know. I'm sorry.
I know, I did that.

01:19:44.217 --> 01:19:46.549
No, no. I didn't come for an apology.

01:19:46.719 --> 01:19:51.019
Obviously your life's more complicated
than you've let on.

01:19:51.724 --> 01:19:55.455
I don't know... I don't know what's
going on in your relationship, Sarah...

01:19:55.728 --> 01:19:57.320
...and I'm not even gonna ask.

01:19:57.730 --> 01:20:01.894
I just... I came down here because
I wanted to tell you something.

01:20:03.236 --> 01:20:08.003
When I saw you walk away last night,
when I watched, it...

01:20:10.243 --> 01:20:13.440
It might as well have been Cabo
30 years ago.

01:20:14.747 --> 01:20:18.877
I didn't tell you the truth before.
I was awake when your mother left.

01:20:19.252 --> 01:20:24.485
I watched her drive away in this old
wood-paneled station wagon.

01:20:25.758 --> 01:20:28.249
It looked like she was crying.

01:20:32.265 --> 01:20:34.563
I'm not my mother, Beau.

01:20:36.769 --> 01:20:38.259
I know.

01:20:41.774 --> 01:20:45.107
You know what I realized
as I was coming back down here?

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.341
I am... I'm a year older than she was
when she died.

01:20:52.785 --> 01:20:56.152
I mean, you have no idea
how strange that feels.

01:20:56.789 --> 01:21:02.159
And I have spent so much of my life
trying to figure out who I am...

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:06.891
...I don't think I realized
I was just trying to find her.

01:21:09.302 --> 01:21:14.001
You know, but that's just
chasing a ghost, you know?

01:21:16.809 --> 01:21:20.973
Maybe we're both just chasing ghosts.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:29.083
You know?

01:21:31.824 --> 01:21:35.885
You're not gonna say, "This could be
the beginning of a beautiful friendship"?

01:21:35.828 --> 01:21:37.557
Wrong movie.

01:21:42.335 --> 01:21:43.927
Well...

01:21:44.837 --> 01:21:46.566
Well...

01:21:48.841 --> 01:21:51.901
It was nice meeting you,
Mr. Burroughs.

01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:56.076
It was nice meeting you,
Ms. Huttinger.

01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:59.545
Goodbye.

01:22:00.853 --> 01:22:02.616
Goodbye.

01:22:04.824 --> 01:22:08.487
- Let's go. You're gonna miss the plane.
- Coming.

01:22:08.828 --> 01:22:11.228
Oh, did you remember to pack
the binoculars, honey?

01:22:11.331 --> 01:22:12.798
We might see monkeys.

01:22:12.832 --> 01:22:15.824
They're still in the bag
with all your shoes.

01:22:16.336 --> 01:22:18.327
- Hey.
- You're gonna have a great time.

01:22:18.338 --> 01:22:21.796
- Yeah.
- Just remember to keep breathing.

01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:25.368
- Yeah. You too.
- You are such a lucky girl.

01:22:25.845 --> 01:22:29.212
Most people wait 10 years
for a second honeymoon.

01:22:29.349 --> 01:22:32.079
- I know.
- You sure you don't wanna come?

01:22:32.352 --> 01:22:35.287
- I think I'm just gonna stay here.
- Well, cheer up.

01:22:35.355 --> 01:22:38.518
You'll find another man
to screw things up with in no time.

01:22:38.858 --> 01:22:41.190
Thank you, Grandma.

01:22:54.874 --> 01:22:58.105
Do you think Scott and Annie are
gonna make it to Belize this time?

01:22:58.378 --> 01:22:59.743
I certainly hope so.

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:06.113
So...

01:23:07.887 --> 01:23:10.151
...what are we gonna do with you?

01:23:19.899 --> 01:23:21.764
Dad, can I ask you a question?

01:23:26.906 --> 01:23:29.807
Before you and Mom got married...

01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:34.437
...do you remember if Mom...

01:23:34.914 --> 01:23:39.317
...sort of took off for a few days?
- You mean when she went to Mexico?

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.150
- Yeah.
- With Beau Burroughs?

01:23:43.923 --> 01:23:45.515
Yeah.

01:23:46.426 --> 01:23:48.758
You knew about that?

01:23:49.929 --> 01:23:52.090
Daddy, why didn't you
just say something?

01:23:51.931 --> 01:23:55.890
What for? I got your mom, he didn't.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:04.273
Did she ever tell you
why she came back?

01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:12.941
Because she loved me.

01:24:16.456 --> 01:24:20.483
She said that, while being
with Beau was an adventure...

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:24.088
...she knew that she could
build a life with me.

01:24:26.966 --> 01:24:31.027
She apologized, she offered to tell me
everything that happened...

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:35.703
...and I didn't need to know.

01:24:37.477 --> 01:24:39.775
As long as she was back.

01:24:46.986 --> 01:24:48.317
Come here.

01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:56.087
Now, this may not be
the sort of thing...

01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:59.329
...that you wanna know
about your parents...

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.699
...but the night that she came back
is the night we conceived you.

01:25:11.511 --> 01:25:14.412
Lucky for us we were married
the next week, so nobody noticed.

01:25:24.023 --> 01:25:27.481
Oh, Daddy, I don't understand.

01:25:27.527 --> 01:25:30.018
Why are we so different?

01:25:31.531 --> 01:25:33.795
I mean, I don't like tennis.

01:25:34.534 --> 01:25:36.593
I drive like a crazy person...

01:25:36.536 --> 01:25:39.664
...and you always drive so slow.

01:25:40.039 --> 01:25:43.839
I only drive slow, sweetheart,
because you're in the car with me.

01:25:49.549 --> 01:25:51.642
Oh, Dad.

01:25:58.558 --> 01:26:02.358
- Take me to the airport.
- You gonna get on the plane this time?

01:26:03.062 --> 01:26:05.963
- I promise.
- Come on.

01:27:29.181 --> 01:27:32.742
- Thank you.
- Nice seeing you again, Sarah.

01:28:04.717 --> 01:28:09.086
If you shut the door, I understand,
but I really hope that you don't.

01:28:44.256 --> 01:28:49.023
I know there's nothing that I can say
that will take away...

01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:51.229
Then don't try.

01:28:57.269 --> 01:28:59.066
I never told you, when I was a kid...

01:28:58.771 --> 01:29:01.103
...I was in a car accident
when I was 10.

01:29:01.273 --> 01:29:05.710
And I smashed my head on
the dashboard and cracked my skull...

01:29:06.278 --> 01:29:08.576
...split it open from here to here,
17 stitches.

01:29:08.781 --> 01:29:12.581
And I never thought that I would
long for that day until now.

01:29:14.286 --> 01:29:16.447
It didn't mean anything.

01:29:16.288 --> 01:29:18.654
It meant something to me.

01:29:19.792 --> 01:29:21.919
Words mean something to me.

01:29:21.794 --> 01:29:24.490
"Engaged" means something to me.

01:29:24.797 --> 01:29:27.027
It doesn't mean
"maybe I'll get married."

01:29:27.299 --> 01:29:30.700
It doesn't mean "I'll see how I feel,
I don't know, I'm not sure."

01:29:30.803 --> 01:29:33.135
It doesn't mean
"I'm gonna test the waters...

01:29:33.305 --> 01:29:36.866
...and see if there's somebody else
out there that I like better."

01:29:37.309 --> 01:29:39.607
It means you've fallen in love
with the person...

01:29:39.812 --> 01:29:41.746
...that you wanna
spend your life with...

01:29:42.314 --> 01:29:45.249
...and that you actually want
to marry them.

01:29:45.818 --> 01:29:48.082
I wanna marry you.

01:29:49.321 --> 01:29:54.156
I'll marry you next month,
I'll marry you this week.

01:29:54.326 --> 01:29:57.727
I'll walk out of this apartment right now
and I will marry you.

01:29:57.830 --> 01:30:01.630
It doesn't work that way, okay?
You can't just walk in here now...

01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:04.735
...and tell me that you can't
live without me and expect...

01:30:04.837 --> 01:30:08.705
What am I supposed to do with that?
I'm supposed to make it all right for you?

01:30:08.841 --> 01:30:10.832
I can't anymore.

01:30:10.843 --> 01:30:13.243
I don't want you to.

01:30:16.849 --> 01:30:19.010
I love you.

01:30:20.853 --> 01:30:24.755
I didn't come here to tell you
that I can't live without you.

01:30:24.857 --> 01:30:26.882
I can live without you.

01:30:31.363 --> 01:30:33.593
I just don't want to.

01:32:15.768 --> 01:32:17.360
One condition.

01:32:21.273 --> 01:32:22.740
If we have a daughter...

01:32:23.275 --> 01:32:25.766
...Burroughs doesn't come
within 1000 miles of her.

01:32:25.778 --> 01:32:27.370
It stops with me.

01:32:33.285 --> 01:32:36.516
On a cold JanuarY night
in the citY of New York...

01:32:36.789 --> 01:32:39.724
...this man and this woman
slept together.

01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:43.353
TheY also slept together
the next night and the next night...

01:32:43.796 --> 01:32:46.321
...and the next night
and the next night.

01:32:47.967 --> 01:32:51.425
In the name of God,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

01:33:06.485 --> 01:33:08.316
Thanks.

01:33:08.487 --> 01:33:10.955
You're gonna have to stop doing that.

01:33:26.505 --> 01:33:29.338
Okay, everybody, all the girls.
