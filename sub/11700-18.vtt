WEBVTT

00:00.809 --> 00:02.244
Okay, Emma, time to give back

00:02.244 --> 00:03.979
all the stuff I've stolen from the bar.

00:03.979 --> 00:05.547
I realize, now that I own it,

00:05.547 --> 00:07.182
I'm just stealing from myself, so...

00:08.550 --> 00:10.152
Good morning, Emma.

00:10.152 --> 00:11.687
Why are you dressed like that?

00:11.687 --> 00:13.055
Because I'm going to work with you.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.590
Danny, when you put on a tie,

00:14.590 --> 00:15.949
it doesn't make you look
like you own a bar.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.118
It makes you look like
a well-dressed giant.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.590
But, for your first official duty,

00:22.590 --> 00:24.049
I think you should be the one
to tell mom we bought the bar.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.084
No worries. I texted her this morning.

00:26.084 --> 00:27.752
Oh, really? How'd she take it?

00:27.752 --> 00:31.222
You two idiots are selling that bar!

00:32.557 --> 00:33.858
She might have had an issue or two.

00:33.858 --> 00:35.860
- Seriously!
- Hi!

00:35.860 --> 00:37.729
Hi, sweetheart! How are you?

00:37.729 --> 00:40.899
Seriously!
What is the matter with you, Danny?

00:40.899 --> 00:45.503
How could you risk your life
savings on something like this?

00:45.503 --> 00:48.706
God, you two have absolutely no experience!

00:48.706 --> 00:51.109
Uh, I've worked in that bar
for over three years now.

00:51.109 --> 00:53.328
Yeah, and I slept around
with half of Manhattan,

00:53.428 --> 00:57.766
but you don't see me running
out and buying a mattress store!

00:57.766 --> 00:59.088
Probably not the best analogy,

00:59.188 --> 01:00.623
but you get my point!

01:00.623 --> 01:02.091
Mom, have a little faith.

01:02.091 --> 01:03.425
What makes you think we can't do this?

01:03.425 --> 01:05.126
Because I raised you.

01:07.363 --> 01:09.671
And you two know nothing about business.

01:09.771 --> 01:11.673
I mean, who's gonna do the books?

01:11.673 --> 01:14.113
Yeah. Yeah, Ben, there's math involved.

01:15.334 --> 01:17.770
It's not just cocktails and drunk girls.

01:17.770 --> 01:21.770
Uh, no, but I would argue
that's a huge part of it.

01:22.174 --> 01:26.412
If you boys screw this up,
you could lose everything.

01:26.412 --> 01:29.214
And don't tell me you're
gonna figure it out together.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.582
Because there hasn't been a Christmas tree

01:30.582 --> 01:32.851
or lemonade stand that you didn't destroy.

01:32.851 --> 01:36.851
Seriously. We had to give free
lemonade to all those firemen.

01:37.356 --> 01:40.092
You are selling that bar!

01:40.092 --> 01:41.898
Mom, we're not selling it.

01:41.998 --> 01:44.100
Oh. Oh, yes, you are...

01:44.100 --> 01:46.068
Or there will be hell to pay.

01:46.068 --> 01:47.555
And believe me, I have an account there.

01:49.605 --> 01:51.940
Say bye-bye to the bar.

01:51.940 --> 01:54.343
- (Door closes) 
-Wow.

01:54.343 --> 01:57.946
She took that a lot better
than I thought she would.

02:09.025 --> 02:10.826
Riley! Just the person I was looking for.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.195
Hey, I think I need a lawyer.

02:12.195 --> 02:14.764
Oh, Tucker, I'm so flattered.

02:14.764 --> 02:17.233
Do you know a good one?

02:18.234 --> 02:21.604
Um, I'm a good lawyer.

02:21.604 --> 02:23.739
Crap. I think I just locked
myself out of my apartment.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.842
Okay, look, so last year,

02:26.842 --> 02:28.844
I'm walking back from
lunch with Mrs. Wheeler

02:28.844 --> 02:31.881
when a pipe fell on me at
this construction site.

02:31.881 --> 02:33.783
She told me if I sued, they'd panic,

02:33.783 --> 02:35.851
and I'd get this huge payout.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.119
But they didn't send me a payout.

02:37.119 --> 02:38.821
They sent me a court date.

02:38.821 --> 02:40.590
It's not like a jury duty notice.

02:40.590 --> 02:42.525
You can't just throw it out.

02:42.525 --> 02:45.995
Tucker, this really could be a huge payout.

02:45.995 --> 02:47.663
Wait, really?

02:47.663 --> 02:48.931
Like, huge, "I'm buying a mansion?"

02:48.931 --> 02:50.666
Or huge, "I can get some new jeans?"

02:50.666 --> 02:53.703
'Cause, girl, you know I need both.

02:53.703 --> 02:56.305
Tucker, I think you could win this thing.

02:56.305 --> 02:58.975
Actually,
I think I could win this thing and...

02:58.975 --> 03:01.644
oh my God! That's my chance
to get noticed for something

03:01.644 --> 03:04.880
other than accidentally
sleeping with the boss.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.816
If it was an accident,

03:06.816 --> 03:09.719
then why do you keep doing it?

03:11.153 --> 03:13.823
Please, you have to let me represent you.

03:13.823 --> 03:16.225
And I promise to be tireless, fearless,

03:16.225 --> 03:18.861
and a consummate professional.

03:18.861 --> 03:20.830
By the way, do you guys
have a key to my place?

03:20.830 --> 03:22.565
Because I'm pretty sure
my briefcase is in there,

03:22.565 --> 03:24.734
and I might have left the oven on.

03:27.003 --> 03:29.538
Oh, hi. I'm Danny Wheeler.

03:29.538 --> 03:31.574
Welcome to our bar.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.111
Oh, hi. I'm Danny Wheeler.

03:35.111 --> 03:36.746
Welcome to our bar.

03:36.746 --> 03:38.114
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.682
What-what-what are you doing?

03:39.682 --> 03:41.452
Making our guests feel more comfortable.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.020
That's what the liquor is for.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.489
Danny, I need your help, okay?
We got some problems.

03:45.489 --> 03:46.957
The dishwasher's broken,
half the taps are empty,

03:46.957 --> 03:48.274
and there's no kegs in the back.

03:48.364 --> 03:49.898
And, Ceecee,
why are you the only waitress out here?

03:49.898 --> 03:50.920
Where are Jessica and Rene?

03:51.020 --> 03:53.022
- They're not on the schedule.
- Well, who makes the schedule?

03:53.022 --> 03:54.490
- The manager.
- Why isn't she here?

03:54.490 --> 03:57.427
- She's not on the schedule.
- Well, who makes the manager's schedule?

03:57.427 --> 03:59.295
Okay. Me.

03:59.295 --> 04:01.397
All right. Okay, then.

04:01.397 --> 04:04.167
Little bit of 'tude on that one.

04:04.167 --> 04:06.169
Hey, boys.

04:06.169 --> 04:08.271
Let me guess.
We need to sell the bar, we're idiots,

04:08.271 --> 04:09.505
and you want a free Chardonnay.

04:09.505 --> 04:12.275
Actually, I came to apologize.

04:12.275 --> 04:14.210
I'm sorry. Apolo-what?

04:14.210 --> 04:15.851
I overreacted. I'm sorry.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.319
Any mother should be proud

04:17.319 --> 04:20.122
that her sons want to work together.

04:20.122 --> 04:23.025
And if this is really
gonna be a family business,

04:23.025 --> 04:24.193
let's make it one.

04:24.193 --> 04:26.061
Put me to work. I'm all yours.

04:26.061 --> 04:28.163
You know, mom,
as much as we appreciate the offer,

04:28.163 --> 04:29.331
and we so do,

04:29.331 --> 04:31.767
I think we pretty much have
everything under control.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.936
Ben, we are now out of dark beer,

04:33.936 --> 04:35.237
and also the fire extinguisher is out...

04:35.237 --> 04:37.106
which I learned when I
tried to put out that fire.

04:37.106 --> 04:38.908
Oh! And by the way, there is a fire!

04:40.142 --> 04:41.044
I got this.

04:41.144 --> 04:44.213
Okay, Ceecee, just add a little
coffee to the light beer, all right?

04:44.213 --> 04:45.915
Ben, call your distributor and tell him

04:45.915 --> 04:48.217
that you are pulling your account if
they're not here in the next half hour.

04:48.217 --> 04:50.386
Danny, call Tony down at the fire station

04:50.386 --> 04:52.288
and tell him that he needs
to get everything up to code

04:52.288 --> 04:54.524
or he won't be putting out
any more fires at my place.

04:54.524 --> 04:56.359
And somebody, for the love of God,

04:56.359 --> 04:59.228
get me a Chardonnay!

05:00.864 --> 05:04.033
Okay, people.
Welcome to Dobbs vs Walderson Construction.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.102
I would like you to treat this
courtroom just like my house.

05:06.102 --> 05:07.937
Which means don't get too comfortable.

05:07.937 --> 05:09.873
I don't like company.

05:09.873 --> 05:13.910
Your honor, we're willing to offer Mr.
Dobbs a $500 settlement to end this.

05:13.910 --> 05:16.079
Oh my God! $500?

05:16.079 --> 05:18.148
(Laughs) Riley, you did it!

05:18.148 --> 05:20.817
I was so wrong about
you sucking at your job.

05:22.218 --> 05:24.192
Your honor, I need a moment with my client.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.960
What the hell is the matter with you?

05:25.960 --> 05:27.462
You're not taking $500.

05:27.462 --> 05:30.098
Uh, you might not be, but I am.

05:30.098 --> 05:31.499
Oh, and get me singles, 'cause I'm gonna

05:31.499 --> 05:34.001
make it rain at the
peppermint tiger tonight!

05:34.001 --> 05:35.369
(Shouting)

05:35.369 --> 05:37.338
Please! Stop it!

05:37.338 --> 05:39.819
Just trust me on this, okay?

05:39.919 --> 05:41.354
Your honor,

05:41.354 --> 05:42.789
my client would like to proceed to trial.

05:42.789 --> 05:45.625
Yeah, that's right.
You're not getting off that easy, okay?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.593
We have boxes of evidence

05:47.593 --> 05:50.596
and eyewitnesses who can
testify to gross negligence.

05:50.596 --> 05:52.665
Look, I know what you're all thinking.

05:52.665 --> 05:54.767
She's young, she's got cute shoes,

05:54.767 --> 05:56.602
she doesn't know what she's doing.

05:56.602 --> 06:00.573
Well, I assure you, I do.

06:00.573 --> 06:01.791
Hmm. Let me guess.

06:01.896 --> 06:03.097
This is your first trial?

06:04.532 --> 06:05.733
It's hard to tell, right?

06:13.775 --> 06:15.510
Cheers.

06:15.510 --> 06:16.811
Congratulations, boys.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.847
Some hard work and we got
this place humming along

06:19.847 --> 06:22.650
like your dad at a Liza Minnelli concert.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.452
I want to say we couldn't
have done it without you,

06:24.452 --> 06:26.954
but I fear that will be
used against me one day.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.524
Excuse me. Are any of you the new owner?

06:29.524 --> 06:30.792
- We are.
- We are.

06:30.597 --> 06:32.198
Can we get you a drink?

06:32.198 --> 06:34.868
Or... Something off the menu?

06:34.868 --> 06:36.906
How about you get rid of the
cockroaches in the kitchen,

06:37.006 --> 06:39.008
you fix the broken gage on the fridge,

06:39.008 --> 06:42.579
and you clean up what I hope
is a giant pool of ketchup?

06:42.579 --> 06:44.247
Health inspector.

06:44.247 --> 06:45.481
I'm shuttin' you boys down.

06:45.481 --> 06:47.603
You what? You can't do that.

06:47.703 --> 06:48.904
I just made a schedule.

06:48.904 --> 06:50.906
Effective immediately.

06:52.942 --> 06:55.644
Okay, well,
he's not gonna get away with this.

06:55.644 --> 06:58.214
Nobody shuts my boys down.

06:58.214 --> 07:00.583
Hey! Hey, you!

07:00.583 --> 07:02.585
You come back here!

07:02.585 --> 07:05.921
Well, in his defense,

07:05.921 --> 07:07.923
it's not ketchup.

07:11.427 --> 07:13.662
I'm not done with you yet!

07:13.662 --> 07:15.488
You were perfect. I think they bought it.

07:15.588 --> 07:17.156
Really? That's great.

07:17.156 --> 07:20.359
But I gotta say, this is the oddest
second date that I've ever been on.

07:20.359 --> 07:22.595
I wish I could say the same.

07:22.595 --> 07:25.064
I just can't believe you'd
do this to your own sons.

07:25.064 --> 07:27.633
Well, then you obviously
don't have children.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.238
It is my job to destroy their dreams

07:29.338 --> 07:31.340
before the big, bad world does it for them.

07:31.340 --> 07:33.576
It's what a good mother does.

07:36.746 --> 07:38.548
(Snoring)

07:38.548 --> 07:40.943
I swear I did it for their own good.

07:41.803 --> 07:43.639
Was it fun?

07:43.639 --> 07:45.874
Sure, but it was for their own good.

07:45.874 --> 07:47.609
Whoo!

07:47.609 --> 07:48.977
I'm awake!

07:48.977 --> 07:51.813
Good morning, mom! I think we're done.

07:51.813 --> 07:53.330
What's going on?

07:53.430 --> 07:54.998
Ben and I have been up all night.

07:54.998 --> 07:56.300
We fixed everything.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.224
The fridge, the roof, the oven,
the dishwasher, the toilet,

07:59.324 --> 08:01.326
and most importantly, the espresso machine.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.094
Have you had one of these? I've had 10.

08:03.094 --> 08:04.229
I can hear my heart.

08:04.229 --> 08:08.299
(Drill buzzing like heartbeat)

08:08.299 --> 08:10.235
That's impossible.

08:10.235 --> 08:12.504
There's no way you could
have done all that.

08:12.604 --> 08:16.808
Are two things I would never
say to you boys, ever.

08:16.808 --> 08:19.010
Oh, hey, mom get this.
I called the health department an hour ago.

08:19.010 --> 08:20.712
They had no record of us being shut down.

08:20.712 --> 08:22.080
So it looks like we're back in business.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.484
Whoo! Yeah! Back in business!

08:25.484 --> 08:27.586
As soon as Danny spackles all the holes

08:27.586 --> 08:29.054
he drilled in the back wall.

08:29.054 --> 08:31.056
Oh.

08:31.056 --> 08:32.957
Hey, Emma.

08:34.125 --> 08:37.962
Okay, ready? Let's get started.

08:37.962 --> 08:39.431
Mr. Dobbs, can you tell us

08:39.431 --> 08:41.600
exactly what happened on
the day of the incident?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.967
I was walking down the street,

08:42.967 --> 08:44.903
and I tripped on a pipe
from the construction site.

08:44.903 --> 08:46.513
Uh, you tripped on a pipe?

08:46.613 --> 08:47.914
Because in your deposition,

08:47.914 --> 08:49.849
you said that the pipe fell on you.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.851
Yeah. You know, I'm just trying to remember

08:51.851 --> 08:53.553
what I made up at the time.

08:54.488 --> 08:57.090
I'm sorry. Uh, made up?

08:57.090 --> 08:59.159
Made up, lied. I'm not really sure

08:59.159 --> 09:02.396
what the exact legal term is.

09:02.396 --> 09:05.599
But, hey, if you want me to say
the same story over and over again,

09:05.599 --> 09:07.401
I should probably write it down.

09:07.401 --> 09:09.420
Yeah, you did. You did write it down

09:09.520 --> 09:11.322
in your sworn, legally-binding statement

09:11.322 --> 09:14.192
in which you stated, and I quote, that...

09:14.192 --> 09:15.359
"You were walking down the street

09:15.359 --> 09:17.261
"when a pipe fell out of the sky

09:17.261 --> 09:18.838
"and struck me on the shoulder."

09:18.938 --> 09:21.373
Okay, then I guess I'll say that, then.

09:21.373 --> 09:23.709
Oh my God!

09:23.709 --> 09:25.581
Tucker, what happened that day?

09:25.681 --> 09:28.984
Mrs. Wheeler and I were walking
past the construction site,

09:28.984 --> 09:30.786
and I was pretending to text

09:30.786 --> 09:32.455
so I didn't have to talk to her.

09:32.455 --> 09:34.351
And, you know, I walked right
past the "do not enter" sign,

09:34.451 --> 09:37.454
and that's when the pipe fell and
splashed some cement on my suit.

09:38.655 --> 09:42.159
Okay, so, um... let me get this straight.

09:42.159 --> 09:46.430
We're suing them for a
$50 dry-cleaning bill?

09:46.430 --> 09:50.234
It's more like $25. I had a coupon.

09:51.602 --> 09:52.124
Okay.

09:52.224 --> 09:53.492
We've gotta get serious, Emma.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.094
Your father and Uncle

09:55.094 --> 09:56.528
think that fixing a few things

09:56.528 --> 09:58.430
means they can run a business.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.665
I swore after the lemonade stand

09:59.665 --> 10:01.567
I would never do this again,

10:01.567 --> 10:03.054
but it's time to bring out the big guns.

10:03.154 --> 10:05.189
Hey, mom,
guess what I'm doing at the bar today.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.824
Owning it.

10:06.824 --> 10:10.961
You know, Ben,
I am really proud of you for stepping up.

10:10.961 --> 10:12.696
Who cares what Danny said?

10:12.696 --> 10:15.332
Uh, I might. What'd he say?

10:15.332 --> 10:18.903
I swore I wouldn't say anything,

10:18.903 --> 10:20.304
but Danny thinks you made a huge mistake,

10:20.304 --> 10:22.206
and you're not mature
enough to run the bar.

10:22.206 --> 10:24.739
Oh, man! I can't believe how
you just tore that out of me!

10:26.041 --> 10:28.076
- He said that?
- Yeah.

10:28.076 --> 10:31.846
Apparently, the only reason he
partnered with you in the first place

10:31.846 --> 10:33.481
is that he's just so worried

10:33.481 --> 10:35.450
that you'll never amount to anything.

10:35.450 --> 10:36.461
I can't believe he'd say that.

10:36.561 --> 10:39.263
Me neither, but he did.

10:40.498 --> 10:42.967
Well, then I guess I'm off
to go do something immature,

10:42.967 --> 10:45.603
like make a living so I can feed my child.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.072
- Bye!
- Bye!

10:48.072 --> 10:50.623
Okay, Emma. One down, one to go.

10:51.298 --> 10:52.666
Oh, hey, mom.

10:52.666 --> 10:55.002
You think it's a good idea
to make the bar cash only?

10:55.002 --> 10:56.503
The more I think about it,

10:56.503 --> 10:58.605
I don't really get how credit cards work.

10:58.605 --> 11:00.450
You know, Danny,

11:00.550 --> 11:03.920
I am really proud of you for stepping up.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.489
Who cares what Ben said?

11:05.489 --> 11:06.656
What did he say?

11:06.656 --> 11:07.858
Oh, never mind.

11:07.858 --> 11:09.860
I swore I wouldn't say anything.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.294
Okay, cool.

11:11.294 --> 11:12.517
Oh, wait! Wait, Danny!

11:12.617 --> 11:14.619
No, I probably should tell you anyway,

11:14.619 --> 11:17.188
even though it pains me to.

11:17.188 --> 11:19.691
But Ben thinks he made a huge mistake,

11:19.691 --> 11:22.260
and that you're not smart enough
to handle owning a business.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.595
Not smart enough?

11:23.595 --> 11:26.144
I was smart enough to save
enough money to buy a business.

11:26.244 --> 11:29.681
But maybe not smart enough
to pick the right partner.

11:29.681 --> 11:30.915
(Door closes)

11:30.915 --> 11:31.950
You know, Emma,

11:31.950 --> 11:34.252
I should write a book about manipulation.

11:34.252 --> 11:35.920
Ooh! Better idea.

11:35.920 --> 11:39.390
I'll trick Tucker into writing it for me.

11:39.390 --> 11:41.926
Yeah? Give it? Yeah.

11:41.926 --> 11:44.696
Tucker! You lied!

11:44.696 --> 11:46.498
You can go to jail.

11:46.498 --> 11:50.368
Jail? For lying?

11:50.368 --> 11:52.003
Well, they better throw you in jail, too,

11:52.003 --> 11:53.872
because you said you were a good lawyer.

11:55.473 --> 11:57.308
You know what? It is my job

11:57.308 --> 11:59.377
to present the best case that I have.

11:59.377 --> 12:00.879
So I'm just gonna take the truth

12:00.879 --> 12:03.248
and, you know, I'll bend it a little.

12:03.248 --> 12:06.251
Here's what they know: The pipe fell.

12:06.251 --> 12:08.520
Here's what they don't need to know:

12:08.520 --> 12:10.688
Where it fell.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.625
Here's what I need to know.

12:13.625 --> 12:16.528
What the hell are you talking about?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.796
- I don't know.
- See.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.372
What do you think you're doing?

12:27.372 --> 12:29.953
Uh, writing tomorrow's drink
specials like I always do.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.822
Is that too hard to figure out?

12:31.822 --> 12:33.890
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just too stupid

12:33.793 --> 12:35.228
to help make a decision around here.

12:35.228 --> 12:37.168
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't know I was too immature

12:37.268 --> 12:39.236
to do this thing that I
do all the time by myself.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.305
You think you know
everything about everything,

12:41.305 --> 12:43.374
and I know nothing about anything.

12:43.374 --> 12:44.990
Maybe this whole thing
is just a big mistake.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.659
Hey, man,
I didn't ask you to buy this place.

12:47.659 --> 12:49.528
It was 100% your own stupid idea.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.363
Buying the bar wasn't stupid.

12:51.363 --> 12:53.265
What was stupid is asking
you to run it with me.

12:53.265 --> 12:55.701
Oh, what are you saying?
You can run this bar without me?

12:55.701 --> 12:57.269
Maybe that is what I'm saying.

12:57.269 --> 12:59.538
Well, then maybe I quit! Good luck!

12:59.538 --> 13:01.039
You can find yourself another brother,

13:01.039 --> 13:02.307
'cause I quit you, too!

13:04.609 --> 13:06.445
Ben!

13:08.147 --> 13:11.150
(Sighs)

13:11.150 --> 13:14.354
Honey, stop worrying about Ben.

13:14.354 --> 13:16.522
You'll make up eventually.
He's your brother.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.188
Actually, he's not.

13:18.288 --> 13:20.056
He quit that job, too.

13:20.056 --> 13:21.858
Honey, don't worry.

13:21.858 --> 13:24.594
We'll find you something
better than a bar to invest in.

13:24.594 --> 13:26.096
Mom, you don't get it.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.331
I didn't invest in the bar,
I invested in Ben.

13:28.331 --> 13:30.200
What do you mean?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.903
If he puts his mind to it,
he can do anything.

13:32.903 --> 13:35.739
I didn't know that you believed
in your brother that much.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.774
Of course I do.

13:37.774 --> 13:39.776
I mean, look at what he's doing with Emma.

13:39.776 --> 13:42.012
There's no bigger curveball
in life than that,

13:42.012 --> 13:43.902
and he took the challenge
and never looked back.

13:44.444 --> 13:46.079
Oh, well.

13:46.079 --> 13:47.147
Doesn't matter now.

13:50.851 --> 13:53.053
Oh my God.

13:53.053 --> 13:54.755
Mom, I just realized what you did.

13:54.755 --> 13:56.924
You do?

13:56.924 --> 13:58.192
Yeah.

13:58.192 --> 13:59.726
You supported us through this whole thing

13:59.726 --> 14:01.528
without any judgment at all.

14:01.528 --> 14:04.531
You're the best!

14:04.531 --> 14:06.867
Anything for my boys.

14:09.536 --> 14:11.905
So in conclusion, Mr. Dobbs,

14:11.905 --> 14:14.107
you walked into the construction site,

14:14.107 --> 14:17.110
the pipe fell, and you
barely avoided death.

14:17.110 --> 14:18.178
Is that correct?

14:19.947 --> 14:22.516
(Tapping)

14:22.516 --> 14:24.651
That is correct.

14:24.651 --> 14:26.787
No further questions, your honor.

14:26.787 --> 14:28.222
The plaintiff rests.

14:32.693 --> 14:35.229
Mr. Dobbs, you are dismissed.

14:35.229 --> 14:38.629
Although I may need to call
you later for a Sidebar.

14:39.437 --> 14:42.573
The Sidebar is a cocktail
lounge across the street.

14:42.573 --> 14:44.442
(Kisses)

14:50.782 --> 14:52.750
I'm not talking to you.

14:52.750 --> 14:53.785
What are you doing here?

14:53.785 --> 14:55.386
I'm not talking to you.

14:55.386 --> 14:56.855
What are you doing here?

14:56.855 --> 14:57.989
Supporting my friends.

14:57.989 --> 15:00.692
Damn it, I wasn't gonna talk to you!

15:00.692 --> 15:02.961
Your honor, the defense would
like to call a rebuttal witness.

15:02.961 --> 15:04.295
Bonnie Wheeler.

15:04.295 --> 15:06.364
What? No! Uh, objection!

15:06.364 --> 15:07.699
She's not on my witness list.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.768
Well, she's on mine.

15:10.768 --> 15:12.737
This is bad, right?

15:12.737 --> 15:16.875
As your attorney,
I'd advise you to start panicking.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.905
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wheeler.

15:18.005 --> 15:19.506
You look lovely today.

15:20.841 --> 15:23.410
That is correct.

15:24.278 --> 15:26.047
Mrs. Wheeler, the plaintiff's lawyer

15:26.047 --> 15:27.748
chose not to call you as a witness today.

15:27.748 --> 15:28.783
Do you know why?

15:28.783 --> 15:30.384
Honey, if I took the time to figure out

15:30.384 --> 15:33.821
why she does what she does,
I'd never leave the house.

15:33.821 --> 15:35.823
It's because she's afraid
of what you would say.

15:35.823 --> 15:37.358
She's afraid of the truth.

15:37.358 --> 15:40.862
Objection! That woman
lies about everything!

15:40.862 --> 15:44.632
And if she denies it,
well, then, she's lying.

15:44.632 --> 15:46.208
Is that true, Mrs. Wheeler?

15:46.308 --> 15:47.576
Are you a liar?

15:50.245 --> 15:52.648
No.

15:52.648 --> 15:53.736
Then why don't you tell us what happened

15:53.836 --> 15:55.004
on the day of the incident?

15:55.004 --> 15:59.004
Okay, well, Tucker and I were
walking back from the bar,

15:59.575 --> 16:01.811
the bar that my sons own.

16:01.811 --> 16:04.547
Well, not for much longer.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.982
Thanks to me.

16:05.982 --> 16:06.968
What is she talking about?

16:07.068 --> 16:09.137
I'm not talking to you.

16:09.137 --> 16:11.472
But I'm also confused.

16:11.472 --> 16:13.574
Mrs. Wheeler, can you please stay focused?

16:13.574 --> 16:15.343
I am focused...

16:15.343 --> 16:18.346
On what a horrible mother I am.

16:18.346 --> 16:21.416
No objection here.

16:24.452 --> 16:27.455
I seduced an out-of-work improv actor

16:27.455 --> 16:29.702
and made my sons believe that
he was a health inspector.

16:29.802 --> 16:31.070
And when that didn't work,

16:31.070 --> 16:33.138
I turned them against each other.

16:33.138 --> 16:34.506
And you know what the worst part is?

16:34.506 --> 16:37.209
That this has nothing to do
with the case we're trying?

16:38.344 --> 16:40.179
Mom, how could you do that?

16:40.179 --> 16:43.182
You mean we cleaned up the bar
and made it better for nothing?

16:43.182 --> 16:45.966
Can we get back to the
incident in question?

16:46.066 --> 16:47.534
Yes.

16:47.534 --> 16:50.904
I only lied because I thought
that I was protecting my kids.

16:50.904 --> 16:53.107
Not that incident!

16:54.308 --> 16:58.308
And what mother doesn't want
the best for her children?

16:59.179 --> 17:01.482
Especially my boys,

17:01.482 --> 17:03.467
who are not just brothers,
they're best friends.

17:04.489 --> 17:07.693
I'm sorry that I made the two of you fight.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.063
You... you guys believed in each other,

17:11.063 --> 17:13.565
and all I did was ruin everything!

17:13.565 --> 17:16.119
I feel almost as bad as I
did after the lemonade stand.

17:16.220 --> 17:19.557
Wait. You destroyed our lemonade stand?

17:19.557 --> 17:21.492
(Pounds gavel) Order! Order in the court!

17:21.492 --> 17:23.127
Mrs. Wheeler, hold it together

17:23.127 --> 17:24.428
or I'll hold you in contempt.

17:24.428 --> 17:27.231
Now, tell us what happened
at Walderson Construction,

17:27.231 --> 17:30.668
or I'll to be on trial for throwing
this gavel at somebody's head.

17:30.668 --> 17:32.503
Um, I'm sorry, your honor.

17:32.503 --> 17:35.239
Um, uh, on the day of the incident,

17:35.239 --> 17:37.241
Tucker and I were walking
past the construction site.

17:37.241 --> 17:39.209
Objection. Irrelevant.

17:39.209 --> 17:40.711
Uh, overruled.

17:40.711 --> 17:41.853
I think that's very relevant.

17:41.953 --> 17:45.890
Well, then, objection. Too relevant.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.260
I'm gonna overrule that
because that's not a thing.

17:50.394 --> 17:53.397
Please proceed, Mrs. Wheeler.

17:53.397 --> 17:55.399
Okay. Well, uh, we accidently

17:55.399 --> 17:57.268
walked into the construction site,

17:57.268 --> 17:58.669
and the pipe fell,

17:58.669 --> 18:00.571
and everybody just jumped out of the way.

18:00.571 --> 18:02.607
It's a miracle that nobody was hurt.

18:02.607 --> 18:04.475
No one was hurt?

18:04.475 --> 18:06.477
I see.

18:07.511 --> 18:09.413
No further questions.

18:10.648 --> 18:14.318
Seriously, is everyone just out to get me?

18:14.318 --> 18:15.386
Everyone. Everyone.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.520
Uh, your honor? Your honor?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.422
I would like to cross-examine the witness.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.758
Mrs. Wheeler,

18:20.758 --> 18:23.694
you said that "everyone"
jumped out of the way.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.930
Who exactly was everyone?

18:25.930 --> 18:29.400
How many civilians had wandered
into the construction site?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.464
I don't know. Five or six.

18:31.564 --> 18:32.765
I wasn't really paying attention.

18:32.765 --> 18:33.933
I was just pretending to text

18:33.933 --> 18:37.236
so I wouldn't have to talk to Tucker.

18:37.236 --> 18:40.239
So, you're telling me
that half a dozen people

18:40.239 --> 18:42.875
were able to accidently wander into

18:42.875 --> 18:44.810
a dangerous construction zone

18:44.810 --> 18:46.111
where things are just flying around

18:46.111 --> 18:47.580
taking people's heads off?

18:47.580 --> 18:49.648
- I object.
- Uh, overruled.

18:49.648 --> 18:50.916
Mrs. Wheeler,

18:50.916 --> 18:52.818
can you draw us a diagram

18:52.818 --> 18:55.521
of exactly where everyone
was standing at the time?

18:55.521 --> 18:58.757
I actually took pictures
of the whole thing. Yeah.

18:58.757 --> 19:01.026
One of the construction
workers was really hot.

19:02.928 --> 19:03.996
Ooh!

19:03.996 --> 19:06.732
Now that's what I call evidence.

19:06.732 --> 19:09.001
Okay. Great, great.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:09.001 --> 19:12.938
All right.
I would like to enter this as exhibit A.

19:12.938 --> 19:14.873
Your honor, in light of these events,

19:14.873 --> 19:16.141
I'd like to offer the plaintiff

19:16.141 --> 19:17.943
a $5,000 settlement.

19:17.943 --> 19:19.111
- Aw, hell no.
- We'll take it.

19:19.111 --> 19:21.947
Shut up, Dobbs. Suck it, Stevens.

19:21.947 --> 19:23.716
I kicked your ass.

19:25.851 --> 19:28.187
Thank you, your honor.

19:28.187 --> 19:29.777
- (Pounds gavel)
- Court is adjourned.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.046
Mr. Dobbs, I need to see
you in my chambers.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.550
I think I see another
suit I can get you out of.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.090
Danny, man, I'm sorry.

19:42.090 --> 19:44.058
I thought you called me irresponsible.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.193
No way, dude.

19:45.193 --> 19:47.061
You're not irresponsible.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.262
I'm sorry, too.

19:48.262 --> 19:49.364
I thought you said I was dumb.

19:49.364 --> 19:52.266
Come on, man. You're not...

19:52.266 --> 19:54.369
You're just...

19:54.369 --> 19:57.071
I love you, man.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.307
I love you, too.

19:59.307 --> 20:01.876
So, boys,

20:01.876 --> 20:04.512
do you ever think you could find
it in your hearts to forgive me?

20:04.512 --> 20:06.614
That depends.
Are you ever gonna do this again?

20:06.614 --> 20:09.117
Never.

20:13.554 --> 20:16.591
I'm not still under oath, am I?

20:21.629 --> 20:24.065
So, after much thought,

20:24.065 --> 20:26.601
Ben and I have decided to
make some changes around here.

20:26.601 --> 20:30.038
We've decided to hire our
youngest employee ever.

20:30.038 --> 20:33.574
This is Emma.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.877
And we've also given her her first task.

20:35.877 --> 20:37.145
Emma, would you like to do the honors?

20:37.145 --> 20:39.247
Aw. What do you have to say to me?

20:39.247 --> 20:41.315
Bye-bye.

20:41.315 --> 20:43.317
Oh, that's so sweet.

20:43.317 --> 20:46.054
- She means you're fired.
- Probably a good move.

20:46.054 --> 20:48.056
- Yeah.
- (Laughs)
