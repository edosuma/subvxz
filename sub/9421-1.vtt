00:08.173 --> 00:11.302
The love of money
is the root of all evil.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.743
That's what they say, anyway.

00:16.816 --> 00:19.478
Money makes everything go wrong.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.222
That's certainly what I always thought.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.218
When I was a kid,

00:26.292 --> 00:30.422
my dad worked for the richest family
in New York City, the Darlings.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.988
It's my job, clare.
If they're gonna buy an entire island,

00:33.066 --> 00:34.226
I have to at least see it first!

00:34.300 --> 00:36.632
Right, and I get to sit here and rot!

00:37.370 --> 00:40.430
You want me to quit?
Do you want me to quit? I quit. Fine.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.566
No, Devlin, take care of the Darlings,

00:42.642 --> 00:45.076
because obviously
they need you more than we do!

00:45.145 --> 00:47.807
Working for the Darlings
was hard on my dad,

00:47.881 --> 00:49.849
but it was even harder on my mom.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.577
And at some point,
you'll come to your senses.

00:51.651 --> 00:55.348
I've already come to my senses, Dutch.
I'm not coming back.

00:55.622 --> 01:00.582
Nicky, it's not your fault.
Mommy just has to go.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.259
Goodbye, sweetheart.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.068
And it was hard for me, too,

01:09.169 --> 01:11.330
as I grew up
in the shadow of my father

01:12.338 --> 01:15.068
and the immensely wealthy family
he worked for.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.574
Nicky, you wait out here, all right?

01:18.645 --> 01:20.135
I have to take care of a few things,

01:20.213 --> 01:23.376
and I'll be back in 10 minutes,
then we'll go home. Okay?

01:24.617 --> 01:25.675
Okay.

01:26.819 --> 01:27.911
Okay.

01:29.789 --> 01:31.154
I hate you.

01:32.625 --> 01:33.990
I love you.

01:34.794 --> 01:37.285
And so, I promised myself
that when I grew up,

01:37.363 --> 01:39.695
I would never be anything like my dad.

01:41.334 --> 01:44.167
And I would never
work for the Darlings.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.501
- Your dad called.
- Great. Who else?

01:46.573 --> 01:49.701
Let them eat food bank,
and judge Campbell called.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.836
- Completely off the record, as usual.
- Yeah, what'd she have to say?

01:52.912 --> 01:54.209
Well, legally speaking,

01:54.280 --> 01:57.010
the sisters of eternal mercy
can keep their little playground...

01:57.083 --> 01:58.141
Oh, that's good.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.880
...if they can find $ 1 million to buy it.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.251
- A million?
- Yep.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.018
Oh, God, why does the world
have to be so miserable?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.925
- That coffee's from yesterday.
- Oh, Daisy!

02:13.433 --> 02:15.401
And your dad called.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.866
- Yeah, you told me that already.
- Again.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.063
He really wants to have lunch
next week.

02:19.138 --> 02:20.696
Well, I'm not gonna be able to do that.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.331
Nick, it's been over two months
since you talked to him.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.137
Look, Daisy, just call him
and tell him I'm sorry,

02:24.210 --> 02:25.643
but I'm too busy. I really am.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.579
And then, two weeks ago,
my father's plane crashed

02:28.648 --> 02:30.343
and everything changed.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.941
Is everyone here
for grandpa's funeral?

02:33.019 --> 02:35.681
- Yeah. They sure are.
- It's weird.

02:35.755 --> 02:37.120
Yeah, it is.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.924
Excuse me.

02:42.195 --> 02:46.291
Excuse me, officer?
Officer, can we get through here?

02:46.366 --> 02:48.334
Sorry, who are you?
Justin Timberlake or k-fed?

02:48.434 --> 02:51.403
- I've heard them all today.
- No, it's my father's funeral.

02:51.471 --> 02:52.802
Oh.

02:52.872 --> 02:55.306
It's everybody's father's funeral today.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.070
You've gotta be kidding me.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.350
Oh, God, here they come.

03:06.219 --> 03:08.312
Daddy, who? Who is it?

03:09.088 --> 03:11.318
It's grandpa's friends, honey.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.652
It's the Darlings.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.980
- Oh, my God. I want to die.
- Tish, you can do this, sweetheart.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.621
Hey, Freddy! Freddy!

03:45.692 --> 03:47.990
How's it feel to leave the pga
to be Mr. Karen Darling?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.926
Don't answer that, baby, they're idiots.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.432
When will you formally announce

03:54.500 --> 03:55.728
your candidacy for the senate?

03:57.270 --> 04:01.639
Please, folks, no politics.
It's a sad day. Sad day for everybody.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.003
Juliet!
Juliet!

04:03.076 --> 04:05.943
- Juliet!
- Juliet!

04:07.747 --> 04:09.374
Juliet, over here!

04:09.449 --> 04:11.212
How are rehearsals going
for wait until dark?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.342
Oh, they're going really good.

04:14.420 --> 04:19.322
I'd never want to be blind,
but playing blind was really fun!

04:22.628 --> 04:25.153
How's it going?
Good to see you, yeah!

04:25.231 --> 04:28.792
- Well, the rumor is you can't act at all.
- Well, you're poor.

04:28.868 --> 04:32.167
And, Juliet, is it true
you're designing a new line of lingerie?

04:32.238 --> 04:34.172
Oh, when'd you get back from Tahiti?

04:34.240 --> 04:36.800
Thirty minutes
and six double espressos ago.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.640
- Kelly slater says, "hi. "
- Kelly. Hi.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.449
What's your reaction
to the stories about you in the tabloids?

04:44.517 --> 04:47.680
Listen, I spend enough of my time
dealing with reputable media, okay?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.051
Patrick, were you close
with Devlin George?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.217
Are you kidding me? He taught me
how to ride my bike and fly-fish.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.522
He helped me pass the New York bar.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.325
He was so much more
than just our lawyer.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.559
- He was like a father to us.
- Patrick!

05:01.167 --> 05:05.126
If you'll excuse me.
Nick, what are you doing out here?

05:05.204 --> 05:08.640
- Just, you know, watching the parade.
- Officer, he's with us.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.676
Right, something special.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.083
I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.486
Thank you.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.718
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.292
Thank you.

05:30.797 --> 05:34.893
And even if your dad did insert himself
a little too much into our family,

05:34.967 --> 05:37.060
but he thought
that's what his job was, right?

05:37.136 --> 05:38.694
To insinuate himself into everything,

05:38.771 --> 05:41.501
so that he could suck as much money
out of us as possible?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.406
You know, Brian, Kiki's right here.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.845
I'm sorry, Nick, you're right.
Let's not fight. I hate you.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.453
I'm sorry grandpa's dead.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.556
Please, God, tell me we'll never
have to see these people again.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.594
Done.

06:20.208 --> 06:23.143
Why are you having a drink
with Tripp Darling?

06:23.978 --> 06:27.209
You told me we'd never have to
see these people again.

06:27.281 --> 06:30.045
Well, he wants to start
this charitable fund in dad's name.

06:30.151 --> 06:32.881
I'm gonna do the paperwork for him,
and then we're done.

06:32.954 --> 06:34.046
Okay?

06:36.357 --> 06:37.688
I promise.

06:39.961 --> 06:41.053
Okay.

06:42.330 --> 06:44.355
Don't turn into a pumpkin.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.328
I'm not gonna turn into anything.

06:55.376 --> 06:58.607
What is happening? Why
the hell is Nick George coming over?

06:59.247 --> 07:02.273
This is the worst idea
in the history of the Western world.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.910
Well, I think
that's a little melodramatic, Brian.

07:04.986 --> 07:08.922
Nick George should not be
our family lawyer, pure and simple.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.890
It's what dad wants, Brian.

07:10.958 --> 07:11.982
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:12.059 --> 07:13.549
And besides, Nick grew up with us.

07:13.628 --> 07:17.587
No, Nick didn't "grow up with us," pat,
he was the offspring of an employee.

07:18.933 --> 07:21.868
Maybe we should let Maria's
little panchito manage your campaign?

07:21.936 --> 07:24.837
- Brian, your father feels that...
- We all know how dad feels.

07:24.906 --> 07:26.635
He loves Nick George, but he's wrong.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.641
Since when is loving someone
ever wrong?

07:28.709 --> 07:31.735
Nick's wet.
He's the brother I always wanted.

07:31.812 --> 07:33.677
Hey, dignats.

07:33.748 --> 07:36.080
Other, other brother. Other brother.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.879
Jeremy, how many times
do I have to tell you?

07:37.952 --> 07:40.113
Get midas off the couch.

07:40.187 --> 07:42.052
Maria, get midas off the couch!

07:42.123 --> 07:44.887
What I don't understand is
why we just don't let the market work.

07:44.992 --> 07:46.357
- The market?
- Freddy,

07:46.460 --> 07:48.621
you're not a part of this family yet,
so just stay out of it.

07:48.729 --> 07:51.391
What he's saying is that
we should shop around.

07:51.465 --> 07:53.023
Which I think is a huge mistake,
by the way.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.536
Look, your father and I
have had an extensive conversation...

07:56.604 --> 07:58.162
But there are better lawyers
than Nick George,

07:58.272 --> 08:00.365
who would do a lot more for us
for a lot less money

08:00.441 --> 08:03.569
and who wouldn't bring this massive
attitude of entitlement to the table.

08:03.644 --> 08:06.374
Nick has never felt entitled to anything.

08:06.447 --> 08:08.540
Karen, you're drunk and in love
with him, so shut the hell up.

08:08.616 --> 08:12.074
- Hey!
- I have had a scotch, okay? One.

08:12.153 --> 08:15.714
Nick George is just like his dad,
he's a glorified parasite!

08:23.331 --> 08:26.027
I want a fresh start
as much as anybody,

08:26.467 --> 08:28.492
but Nick is your father's choice.

08:29.637 --> 08:31.195
And that's that.

08:36.677 --> 08:38.144
That the '90?

08:38.779 --> 08:40.337
Give that a try.

08:41.982 --> 08:45.146
It's a little vineyard
we just bought in Bordeaux.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.183
It's amazing.

08:52.259 --> 08:53.886
- You still take an interest?
- I do.

08:53.961 --> 08:55.690
I don't get to taste
things like this too often.

08:55.763 --> 08:58.994
- Not in my line of work, you know?
- Yeah, well.

08:59.066 --> 09:02.229
Maybe your line of work
is about to change, huh?

09:02.336 --> 09:04.304
What do you mean by that?

09:06.440 --> 09:08.408
I need your help, Nicky.

09:09.610 --> 09:12.272
- With what?
- With the family, you know.

09:13.014 --> 09:14.504
Daily affairs.

09:15.716 --> 09:17.274
Since your dad's gone,

09:18.452 --> 09:20.784
paperwork alone eating me alive.

09:21.288 --> 09:24.121
Tripp, certainly there are
better equipped lawyers than me

09:24.191 --> 09:26.751
- to deal with the family affairs.
- Yeah, I know.

09:26.861 --> 09:31.423
And I contemplated bringing
some hotshot in to take the reins.

09:33.467 --> 09:35.196
No one seems right.

09:35.703 --> 09:39.070
- I considered Johnnie Cochran.
- He's dead, Tripp.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.165
Yeah, I know. I found out.

09:43.444 --> 09:46.709
He was a bit of a grandstander,
anyway, loudmouth.

09:47.715 --> 09:49.546
I spoke with bill.

09:49.617 --> 09:50.948
- Bill Clinton?
- Uh-huh.

09:51.018 --> 09:53.248
You asked Bill Clinton
if he wanted to represent the family?

09:53.320 --> 09:56.380
I took my shot.
I mean, you know me, Nicky.

09:56.457 --> 10:00.894
Thing is, when I really stopped
and thought about it...

10:03.664 --> 10:06.224
- You're the guy.
- Oh, God.

10:08.002 --> 10:10.493
You know us, Nicky. You're the guy.

10:12.606 --> 10:14.699
I'm flattered, Tripp, but...

10:16.243 --> 10:18.268
What Patrick said at the funeral
the other day is true.

10:18.345 --> 10:20.813
I really did have to share dad
with you guys when I was growing up,

10:20.881 --> 10:22.246
and I didn't like it.

10:25.219 --> 10:27.779
I won't do that to my wife and
I certainly won't do that to my daughter.

10:27.855 --> 10:30.346
- You wanna be a good dad.
- I do.

10:30.424 --> 10:35.191
So did Dutch. And look at you, Nicky.
You're a successful lawyer,

10:35.296 --> 10:39.665
you're a family man, and best of all,
you've got a moral center.

10:39.767 --> 10:45.205
So, you tell me, who did wrong?
If I had one kid like you, I'd be lucky.

10:47.208 --> 10:50.769
- But I don't.
- Tripp, I just don't think it's a good fit.

10:51.245 --> 10:54.976
- I'm gonna put my nuts on the table.
- Okay, if you have to.

10:55.249 --> 10:59.015
I'll give you $5 million a year
on top of what I'd pay you

10:59.120 --> 11:00.678
to do all your good works around town,

11:00.788 --> 11:05.157
all your little charitable projects.
You keep your practice,

11:05.259 --> 11:08.490
keep everybody on salary,
keep everything as is.

11:08.562 --> 11:10.427
Why would you do that?

11:11.665 --> 11:12.996
Because

11:14.401 --> 11:16.028
I miss your dad.

11:16.837 --> 11:20.136
I miss having
that solid citizen by my side

11:20.207 --> 11:22.573
to tell me which way is up.

11:25.012 --> 11:26.536
And I trust you.

11:33.387 --> 11:36.220
- I'd have to do it my own way.
- Hey, what man wouldn't?

11:36.290 --> 11:39.987
- I'd have to keep regular hours.
- Keep whatever hours you want.

11:40.060 --> 11:41.027
I'd have to be able to say no

11:41.128 --> 11:43.460
if I felt I was participating
in anything questionable.

11:43.531 --> 11:47.661
- No one forces your hand, Nicky.
- And I'd never lie for the family.

11:48.369 --> 11:50.303
We would never ask you to.

11:55.409 --> 11:56.842
Ten million.

11:58.946 --> 12:00.072
Done.

12:14.290 --> 12:17.987
Thank you for an amazing night.
Did we just win the lottery?

12:18.060 --> 12:19.118
What do you mean?

12:19.195 --> 12:23.723
You just took me to a $500 dinner
and you bought these tickets to abt.

12:23.799 --> 12:27.360
Last time I checked, you're a lawyer
who basically works for free.

12:27.436 --> 12:30.769
- I took the job working for the family.
- What?

12:30.840 --> 12:33.468
Lisa, this is a good thing.
It's a good thing.

12:33.542 --> 12:34.702
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

12:34.810 --> 12:38.337
This is a really, really good thing.

12:38.414 --> 12:40.382
Tripp is giving me $ 10 million a year

12:40.449 --> 12:44.385
to start a charitable foundation
in dad's name, on top of my salary,

12:44.453 --> 12:46.978
which is gonna be pretty impressive.

12:47.056 --> 12:50.321
He's giving you $ 10 million a year
to just give away?

12:50.392 --> 12:51.484
Yeah.

12:54.230 --> 12:56.994
I don't know.
Are you sure you really want to do this?

12:57.066 --> 12:58.397
- I mean, your dad was a mess...
- Wait a minute.

12:58.467 --> 13:01.095
- Lise, Lise, Lise, I am not my dad.
- I know that.

13:01.170 --> 13:03.035
But if you're taking the job
to prove that you know it,

13:03.105 --> 13:05.130
it's not the right reason to take the job.

13:05.207 --> 13:08.335
That's not the reason I'm doing this.
This is a great opportunity.

13:10.179 --> 13:12.545
Okay? And I'm gonna do it my way.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.414
I like the way you do things.

13:15.484 --> 13:16.849
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:21.056 --> 13:23.320
So, I guess that could work.

13:23.392 --> 13:25.292
Mmm-hmm?

13:25.361 --> 13:27.795
You think it's gonna work, huh?

13:36.338 --> 13:38.431
- Hello?
- Hey, Nick, it's me.

13:39.341 --> 13:42.833
- Me who?
- Germs. Jeremy Darling.

13:42.912 --> 13:45.039
- Who is it?
- It's Jeremy Darling.

13:45.114 --> 13:48.208
- Oh, my God.
- Listen, Jeremy, can you call me later?

13:48.284 --> 13:51.845
No, I'm playing poker
over at Ethan Hawke's place.

13:52.621 --> 13:53.986
I just won a yacht.

13:54.056 --> 13:56.547
Yeah, well, winning's a great feeling,
Jeremy, but listen, you gotta...

13:56.625 --> 13:59.150
It's wet, are you kidding me?
It's totally wet.

14:01.630 --> 14:04.565
Jeremy, what exactly do you need,
besides maybe some toilet paper?

14:04.633 --> 14:10.663
Well, this guy, François, I won it from,
he says that the title is on the yacht

14:10.739 --> 14:14.004
at Chelsea piers in the galley
and I can just take it.

14:14.443 --> 14:16.001
Is it really that simple?

14:16.578 --> 14:19.638
No, no, no, it's not that simple.
Where's it registered?

14:19.715 --> 14:22.946
France, probably? Or Germany?
I don't know.

14:24.153 --> 14:25.916
This is why I need help, Nick.

14:28.357 --> 14:29.619
Would you knock it off?

14:29.692 --> 14:31.523
Hey, listen,
here's what you're gonna have to do.

14:31.593 --> 14:34.426
You have to get the title
and bring it to my office later today

14:34.496 --> 14:36.054
and we'll make sure everything's okay.

14:36.165 --> 14:38.224
Thank you, Nick! You're the wettest!

14:46.208 --> 14:47.266
Daisy?

14:47.977 --> 14:50.502
Can you put the family's phone
numbers into this thing for me, please?

14:50.579 --> 14:51.739
- Sure.
- And don't let me forget,

14:51.847 --> 14:55.578
I'm picking up Kiki after school.
Hey, I am sorry I'm late.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.344
I got trapped on a phone call
with your brother Brian.

15:00.422 --> 15:02.982
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick. What was it about?

15:03.092 --> 15:04.252
Oh, God, I don't know.

15:04.326 --> 15:05.987
He wanted my help
getting some parishioner's kid

15:06.061 --> 15:09.963
into the maple grove academy.
Not my job.

15:10.766 --> 15:12.495
Nick deflowered me.

15:14.103 --> 15:17.664
- Really? That's great.
- What, Nick? It's just the truth.

15:18.507 --> 15:21.874
- Karen, do you have a check for me?
- Yep, here it is.

15:22.411 --> 15:24.902
$ 10 million from
the Darling family foundation

15:24.980 --> 15:26.811
for you to do all kinds of good with.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.247
Well, actually, before the day's over,

15:28.317 --> 15:31.480
I'm gonna use one million of it to save
a playground for some orphans.

15:31.553 --> 15:34.044
Oh, orphans!

15:35.024 --> 15:38.255
Nick used to read me poetry out loud.
It was so sweet.

15:38.327 --> 15:40.454
- Do you remember, Nick? Remember?
- Karen, I really...

15:40.529 --> 15:42.224
I always thought we'd be married,
didn't you?

15:42.297 --> 15:43.662
Karen...
I did.

15:43.732 --> 15:45.165
- Freddy...
Instead I married three...

15:45.234 --> 15:47.759
Well, it's gonna be four other people.

15:47.836 --> 15:50.304
It's weird. Weird, isn't it?

15:52.341 --> 15:53.899
Life's so weird.

15:59.014 --> 16:00.879
So, I have

16:00.949 --> 16:02.712
- your prenups here for you to sign...
- Oh, yeah.

16:02.785 --> 16:05.151
...if you're ready.
Yeah. Let's do that.

16:05.888 --> 16:08.186
It's so exciting.

16:09.425 --> 16:10.983
Well, I hope you two enjoy...

16:11.093 --> 16:13.527
Are you coming to mommy
and daddy's anniversary party tonight?

16:13.595 --> 16:17.122
Yeah. With Lisa, my wife.
We'll both be there.

16:17.199 --> 16:18.530
- Bye.
- Bye.

16:21.070 --> 16:23.903
She's still in love with you, huh?

16:23.972 --> 16:26.133
She's in love with everybody.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.836
Oh, here's your phone,
armed and ready.

16:29.812 --> 16:31.109
Thank you.

16:34.149 --> 16:35.241
Nice.

16:36.985 --> 16:39.954
Brian, I told you, I am not going
to the maple grove academy.

16:40.622 --> 16:43.318
I'll give you $40,000. Just let him in.

16:43.392 --> 16:46.555
This is an academic institution,
reverend, not an auction.

16:46.662 --> 16:47.890
Don't lecture me, bozo.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.590
I'll have somebody come up here
and beat you up.

16:49.665 --> 16:51.394
Sorry I'm late.
Where the hell have you been?

16:51.467 --> 16:52.729
What's going on?

16:52.801 --> 16:55.235
This is Nick George, our family lawyer,

16:55.304 --> 16:57.534
and you better do what he says
or else...

16:57.606 --> 16:58.971
Or else you're gonna wake up
tomorrow morning

16:59.074 --> 17:00.974
and find your tires slashed
or something.

17:01.043 --> 17:04.376
- It won't be good. I promise.
- Where the hell are you going?

17:04.444 --> 17:06.471
I have to go do a baptism.

17:07.848 --> 17:11.012
Mr. George, I'll be Frank.

17:11.086 --> 17:14.852
If the child was legally a Darling,
there would not be a problem here.

17:14.957 --> 17:16.788
He could come to maple grove for free.

17:16.858 --> 17:18.190
Wait, what do you mean,
"legally a Darling"?

17:18.260 --> 17:19.625
I mean, as long as
the reverend Darling

17:19.694 --> 17:21.252
refuses to claim the boy as his son,

17:21.329 --> 17:23.423
there is no place for him here
at maple grove.

17:23.499 --> 17:25.021
- I'm really sorry.
- Wait a minute.

17:25.098 --> 17:27.068
- This kid is Brian's?
- He didn't tell you that?

17:28.270 --> 17:30.033
Pardon me one second.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.998
Hey, Juliet, what's up?

17:33.075 --> 17:36.203
If I am so terrible,
Duncan mcdoorknob,

17:36.278 --> 17:37.745
then why'd you cast me?

17:37.813 --> 17:40.577
Because your dad's financing
the whole production!

17:40.682 --> 17:42.343
- Daddy paid for this?
- Of course!

17:42.417 --> 17:43.975
You don't think you can act, do you?

17:44.052 --> 17:45.883
I mean, haven't you seen the looks
on everyone's mugs

17:45.954 --> 17:48.013
when you squeak and squawk
your way through your lines,

17:48.090 --> 17:51.218
you dodgy wee twig!
Or are you blind, as well?

17:51.293 --> 17:52.851
You're a nightmare!

17:52.928 --> 17:55.260
Daddy said he wasn't gonna
do that anymore.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.059
I thought I earned this part.

17:57.132 --> 18:00.101
- Juliet, there are ways...
- Oh, I wish I was dead!

18:00.169 --> 18:01.693
...to earn the part.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.931
What exactly went wrong here?

18:04.039 --> 18:06.405
She stepped on the stage,
that's what went wrong!

18:06.508 --> 18:10.672
She couldn't act her way out of
a paper bag, mate, let alone a play!

18:11.079 --> 18:14.742
She's... she's not good.

18:19.154 --> 18:20.519
God help me.

18:21.456 --> 18:22.480
Hello?

18:22.958 --> 18:25.859
I won it in a frigging poker game, dude!
They came with the boat!

18:25.928 --> 18:28.362
They're illegals, Mr. Darling.
Your name's on the title.

18:28.430 --> 18:32.093
Yeah, but look, officer. He just wrote
his name in, just now, in crayon.

18:32.167 --> 18:34.658
I don't care if he drew it with
his little peepee in the snow, shyster,

18:34.736 --> 18:35.703
- we're taking him in.
- Look,

18:35.804 --> 18:37.101
he doesn't even know these guys!

18:37.172 --> 18:39.936
It's true, I've never met those guys
before in my life. Right, guys?

18:40.042 --> 18:41.407
- Okay, captain Jerry!
- Okay, captain Jerry!

18:41.476 --> 18:43.137
- Captain Jerry, okay!
- Captain Jerry, okay!

18:44.746 --> 18:47.510
- Did you teach them how to do that?
- I was just having a little fun.

18:47.616 --> 18:49.345
Get him out of here.

18:50.786 --> 18:51.946
You gotta bail me out, Nick.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.989
If I miss mom and dad's anniversary
party tonight, dad is gonna kill me.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.888
- I'll be right there.
- He'll kill me!

18:56.959 --> 18:58.324
Right there!

18:59.194 --> 19:01.094
Look, I don't think this is gonna...

19:02.331 --> 19:03.628
Damn it.

19:03.699 --> 19:05.064
What's the matter?

19:05.534 --> 19:07.297
I forgot to pick up my daughter!

19:14.943 --> 19:19.209
You are the most important thing
in the world to your father.

19:19.648 --> 19:20.706
I know.

19:20.782 --> 19:24.650
And he has gone out of his way
to give you this opportunity.

19:24.720 --> 19:26.449
But I don't want it.

19:27.522 --> 19:29.456
It makes me feel so stupid and lame

19:29.524 --> 19:32.550
to have everything taken care of
all the time.

19:33.061 --> 19:35.188
I want to be a human being.

19:36.465 --> 19:38.433
And someday you'll be one.

19:38.900 --> 19:41.391
Someday you'll walk out of this house

19:41.470 --> 19:43.961
and do everything
just the way you want.

19:45.107 --> 19:47.871
On your own. Free.

19:48.543 --> 19:50.033
But not today.

19:53.348 --> 19:55.316
Oh, I hate that thing.

19:55.917 --> 20:01.082
As a favor to your father and me
on our anniversary,

20:01.390 --> 20:04.723
no extravagant gestures of protest.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.653
Jeremy, did your brother Patrick

20:32.721 --> 20:34.848
use his influence as Attorney General
to get you released?

20:34.923 --> 20:37.153
All right, listen, this has been
a massive misunderstanding,

20:37.225 --> 20:38.886
and I can assure you
that my client is gonna be found...

20:38.960 --> 20:40.393
Are you getting back
together with Kylie Minogue?

20:40.462 --> 20:42.623
...innocent of all charges
brought against him,

20:42.698 --> 20:44.393
so there's no story here,
please excuse us.

20:44.466 --> 20:46.696
Is it true you won the yacht
in a poker game, Jeremy?

20:46.768 --> 20:49.236
Jeremy, how long have you been
smuggling people into the country?

20:49.304 --> 20:50.862
- I don't know...
- Don't answer that.

20:50.972 --> 20:52.837
Is it true you were
planning to harvest their organs?

20:52.908 --> 20:54.239
You know, that is just dumb.

20:55.744 --> 20:58.513
Why say things like that?
No further questions!

21:11.688 --> 21:14.714
Dad's gonna kill me.
- He's not gonna kill you.

21:16.193 --> 21:18.218
Then he'll have me killed.

21:19.730 --> 21:23.097
Can you just give us a minute, please?
I'll talk to him. It's gonna be all right.

21:23.166 --> 21:27.330
It's not gonna do any good, all right?
He thinks I'm a loser and he's right.

21:27.437 --> 21:31.271
I mean, look at me. I can't even
win a yacht without getting arrested.

21:31.341 --> 21:32.603
I have the worst life in the world.

21:32.676 --> 21:35.611
- Jeremy. Jeremy, shut up!
- What? I do, Nick! What?

21:35.679 --> 21:37.442
You have all the money
you're ever gonna need.

21:37.514 --> 21:39.482
You're never gonna have to
work a day in your life.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.813
30,000 people
die of starvation every day.

21:41.885 --> 21:44.945
- Did you know that? Every day.
- Yeah, but out of seven billion people...

21:45.021 --> 21:48.354
Look, the point is that
life for most people is a living hell!

21:48.425 --> 21:50.450
Your life is not the worst life
in the world

21:50.527 --> 21:53.223
by any stretch of the imagination! Any!

21:55.399 --> 21:56.491
What?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.668
You wouldn't understand.

22:01.171 --> 22:03.731
Give that to Kiki.
Tell her I'm sorry I made you late.

22:03.807 --> 22:06.776
- Where'd you learn how to do that?
- My coke dealer.

22:15.185 --> 22:16.152
Thank you.

22:16.253 --> 22:18.312
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.019
This way.

22:25.061 --> 22:26.392
Champagne?

22:38.141 --> 22:39.665
Excuse me. Excuse me.

22:40.410 --> 22:41.934
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.240
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

22:43.313 --> 22:45.838
- Sorry about Kiki.
- It's okay. I got her.

22:46.049 --> 22:48.017
This party is amazing.

22:48.852 --> 22:50.410
These guys are from the philharmonic,

22:50.520 --> 22:53.216
and someone said that
Josh Groban might be singing later.

22:53.290 --> 22:57.249
Yeah, well, this is what these guys
do best, you know. They spend money.

22:58.995 --> 23:01.020
Yeah, the wedding has to be the 18th,

23:01.097 --> 23:02.826
because Nick's playing
in the u. S. Open

23:02.899 --> 23:05.026
- and Tiger Woods said...
Freddy.

23:05.101 --> 23:06.864
- What?
- You said Nick. I'm Freddy.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.938
I'm the one playing in the open.

23:12.742 --> 23:14.209
That's right.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.974
He's the one...
He's playing in the u. S. Open.

23:24.488 --> 23:27.787
- Well, take them home then.
- Have you seen Juliet?

23:27.858 --> 23:29.826
Come on, put on something nice
before mom sees you.

23:29.893 --> 23:31.554
Brian, this shirt cost
1,000 bucks, okay?

23:31.628 --> 23:33.994
Chill. Hey, no fun.

23:35.365 --> 23:39.426
And Tripp had Doug Henning
flown in from Vegas...

23:40.604 --> 23:43.505
Oh, there were
hot air balloon rides, ponies,

23:43.573 --> 23:46.303
you know, a typical birthday party.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.776
But when it came time to leave,
we couldn't find Nicky.

23:51.581 --> 23:53.105
He'd vanished.

23:53.183 --> 23:55.413
For two hours, we searched for him.

23:55.485 --> 23:57.919
- Where was he?
- In the wine cellar.

23:58.655 --> 24:02.022
He was down there, sobbing.
Didn't want to go home.

24:04.427 --> 24:07.590
But Dutch was so good with you
that night.

24:08.665 --> 24:11.225
The way he carried you to the car...

24:13.970 --> 24:17.872
He was so... so tender.

24:19.175 --> 24:21.700
- It's okay, Tish.
- No. No, it's not.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.347
I mean, how many men
do we know today,

24:25.415 --> 24:29.681
really, who could raise a child like that,
all alone, and do it so well?

24:31.855 --> 24:35.586
Sometimes it seems the whole cosmos
is in a state of decay.

24:36.459 --> 24:38.791
It's a little tough around here.

24:39.029 --> 24:40.758
You know how it is.

24:40.964 --> 24:44.525
Well, that's true, actually,
what mom just said about the cosmos.

24:44.634 --> 24:47.865
I mean, space is frigging...
It's coming apart.

24:50.273 --> 24:51.604
True story.

24:52.342 --> 24:54.469
What are you talking about?

25:02.852 --> 25:04.012
Jeremy.

25:05.956 --> 25:07.048
Have you seen Juliet?

25:07.123 --> 25:08.647
Mmm-hmm.

25:09.326 --> 25:10.452
And how do you think
that makes me feel?

25:10.527 --> 25:12.757
- It was a mistake. I'm sorry.
- A mistake? "Sorry"?

25:12.829 --> 25:14.126
I mean, do you have a thing
for this guy?

25:14.197 --> 25:16.222
- Sure. No, I...
- What?

25:17.434 --> 25:18.799
He's taken.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.327
- Nick is my past.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.702
And you, Freddy,
you're my future, okay?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.674
That's right. That's right.

25:28.144 --> 25:29.975
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
I met one of the Kennedys earlier.

25:30.046 --> 25:31.570
Jeez, I don't know which one,

25:31.648 --> 25:33.377
but he owns a private course
outside of Glasgow

25:33.450 --> 25:35.509
and he really wants me to play it.

25:35.585 --> 25:37.052
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.179
So I told him we could take
the family jet next week.

25:39.255 --> 25:42.588
- Is that cool?
- Of course.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.123
So, word's out
you're headed for the senate, pat.

25:47.697 --> 25:48.857
Really?

25:49.199 --> 25:52.293
- Well, that's news to me, Dan.
So, you won't be running?

25:52.369 --> 25:53.893
Ready to put that on the record?

25:53.970 --> 25:56.200
Let's just say
I'm happy being Attorney General

25:56.272 --> 25:58.934
and, as you know,
I would miss New York so much.

25:59.009 --> 26:02.103
After all, it is
the great American city, right?

26:02.245 --> 26:03.405
Excuse me.

26:06.816 --> 26:10.115
- If you'll excuse me for a moment?
Of course.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.883
I'll be right back.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.759
So he is running, isn't he?

26:17.560 --> 26:19.585
He doesn't have a choice.

26:19.896 --> 26:21.454
I've got it, dilbert.

26:21.564 --> 26:23.327
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

26:27.103 --> 26:29.071
What are you doing here?

26:29.139 --> 26:32.199
I missed you. You haven't called.

26:32.275 --> 26:34.243
It's not good for you to be here.

26:34.310 --> 26:36.608
Well, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

26:36.680 --> 26:39.046
You can't tell me you love me
and then disappear for weeks at a time.

26:39.149 --> 26:40.309
You can't do that!

26:40.417 --> 26:42.977
Please don't raise your voice,
honey, okay?

26:43.086 --> 26:44.178
Don't be mad.

26:44.254 --> 26:46.814
Just do me a favor,
go to the Ashley square, get a room.

26:46.890 --> 26:50.519
- I'll come when the party's over, okay?
- Oh, yes, you will.

26:56.766 --> 26:57.790
Go.

27:04.107 --> 27:06.803
It makes me so sad

27:06.876 --> 27:09.743
that it all has to end someday, this...

27:10.447 --> 27:12.210
This pageant,

27:12.849 --> 27:15.818
this beautiful, beautiful adventure.

27:17.620 --> 27:20.453
You truly are, in flesh and blood,

27:21.391 --> 27:24.849
the great, great love of my life.

27:26.329 --> 27:28.297
And I thank you for that.

27:29.332 --> 27:30.697
I love you.

27:39.876 --> 27:40.934
Hey.

27:41.277 --> 27:45.111
This year was me and Juliet's turn
to pick out the gift from the children.

27:45.181 --> 27:48.617
So, in honor of the day
that you two first met

27:48.685 --> 27:52.644
at the Saratoga race course...
Go ahead, Leopold.

27:56.993 --> 28:00.929
This is Irish ice.
He won the breeders' cup last year.

28:00.997 --> 28:02.294
I guess. Something like that.

28:02.365 --> 28:06.995
And tonight, he's ridden by Saratoga's
very own Tommy Crenshaw!

28:10.140 --> 28:11.903
Happy anniversary!

28:12.041 --> 28:13.406
Thank you, Juliet.

28:13.877 --> 28:15.845
Oh, I love you.

28:25.655 --> 28:28.146
Juliet? Where is she?

28:29.425 --> 28:31.950
Thank you. Thank you, Jeremy.

28:33.897 --> 28:37.799
Now, get that thing out of here, before
it does something unseemly, all right?

28:38.902 --> 28:41.234
Great. Head them up! Move them out!

28:51.314 --> 28:53.976
Nick, what are you doing up here?

28:56.319 --> 28:59.413
I was just looking for Patrick.
He sent me this thing and I...

29:00.657 --> 29:03.217
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:06.029 --> 29:07.291
I'm fine.

29:09.566 --> 29:12.126
- What's going on?
- It's Freddy and me.

29:14.504 --> 29:19.407
I don't know, Nick, I don't know.
I just... I pick these guys.

29:20.476 --> 29:22.307
It's so hard.

29:23.580 --> 29:26.413
- Seems better than the last one.
- Oh, yeah.

29:30.887 --> 29:32.912
All they see is the money, Nick.

29:33.556 --> 29:38.687
All they see is my name and my money
and nobody sees me.

29:38.761 --> 29:39.819
I can't imagine that's true.

29:39.896 --> 29:43.059
You can't imagine that's true
because you would never be that way.

29:44.100 --> 29:48.059
I think you're the only guy I ever dated
who actually really saw me, you know?

29:48.171 --> 29:50.332
Just... just me.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.639
Karen, listen, I don't know what
happened between you and Freddy,

29:54.711 --> 29:55.973
and I don't want to know.

29:56.045 --> 29:59.412
But if you don't wanna marry
this guy, don't. Life is short.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.914
And you...

30:06.122 --> 30:09.091
- And you deserve to be loved.
- You're sweet.

30:12.362 --> 30:13.920
You're so sweet.

30:22.939 --> 30:24.031
Nick?

30:28.111 --> 30:29.544
Patrick's looking for you.

30:29.612 --> 30:31.546
- I know, he...
- Sorry to interrupt.

30:31.614 --> 30:33.172
Oh, that's okay.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.278
Damn it.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.391
Excuse me?
Did my wife just come by here?

30:42.458 --> 30:44.949
Short hair, black gown, pissed?

30:45.828 --> 30:47.295
What happened at maple grove?

30:47.363 --> 30:49.661
Brian, I cannot deal with this right now.

30:49.732 --> 30:52.030
Oh, but you can show up here
like you belong?

30:52.101 --> 30:53.466
You're on the clock, Nick.
Answer my question!

30:53.569 --> 30:57.630
Okay. Okay.
If you'll admit the kid is yours, Brian,

30:57.707 --> 31:00.938
if you're willing to
stick your family's proud name on him,

31:01.010 --> 31:02.375
then he can go to maple grove.

31:02.445 --> 31:05.175
If not, the little bastard's out of luck!

31:08.151 --> 31:10.278
Yeah, go ahead. Run away.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.951
You know, you are just like
your stupid dad.

31:16.392 --> 31:20.158
You stand around all day
with your hand out, taking our money,

31:20.596 --> 31:22.962
but when it comes time
to actually getting things done,

31:23.066 --> 31:25.227
you're worthless! I hate you!

31:33.476 --> 31:37.640
Don't you ever talk about my father
like that again, you son of a bitch!

31:37.714 --> 31:39.409
What the hell's going on here?

31:39.482 --> 31:41.450
- He started it!
- Shut up!

31:42.151 --> 31:43.618
Get a doctor!

31:44.354 --> 31:47.721
- What's the matter?
- It's Juliet! Get a doctor!

31:50.259 --> 31:51.624
Here we go.

32:00.336 --> 32:02.861
Looks like she took
somewhere between 10 and 20,

32:02.939 --> 32:05.407
but she expelled quite a few of them
into her pillow.

32:05.475 --> 32:08.171
I think she'll be fine, Tripp.
She just needs some rest.

32:08.244 --> 32:09.609
Thanks, doc.

32:12.915 --> 32:16.681
You have any idea why she'd do this,
Nick? Any clue?

32:17.353 --> 32:19.821
She knows you bought her the part.

32:20.256 --> 32:21.484
Well...

32:22.592 --> 32:24.617
I guess we're gonna have to be
a little more tricky

32:24.694 --> 32:27.993
about how we lay the train tracks
ahead of her, huh?

32:28.064 --> 32:29.691
Out in the world.

32:30.066 --> 32:31.158
What?

32:31.734 --> 32:33.759
Speak, Nick. I'm all ears.

32:34.570 --> 32:35.730
I quit.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.096
Tough day, huh?

32:38.608 --> 32:40.940
I'm serious. This isn't me, Tripp.

32:41.010 --> 32:42.341
This job...

32:44.313 --> 32:46.042
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

33:05.995 --> 33:07.553
Nick. Nicky!

33:08.664 --> 33:10.495
Look, I can't talk right now, pat.
I'm sorry.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.466
- Did you get my note, at the party?
- Yeah.

33:12.535 --> 33:14.696
Yeah, I did. Code pink?
What the hell is that?

33:14.804 --> 33:16.237
- Come on, get in, I'll tell you.
- No.

33:16.305 --> 33:20.435
- Pat, I just told your dad I quit. Sorry.
- Nick, please. It's life and death.

33:28.150 --> 33:31.119
Just go up to the room
and explain to her that it's over.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.279
- Her?
- Yeah.

33:34.256 --> 33:37.225
No, you do it. He's your girlfriend. She.

33:37.326 --> 33:40.557
I can't, Nick, I tried.
She gets so emotional.

33:40.629 --> 33:41.994
It kills me.

33:42.098 --> 33:45.329
Please tell me you never asked my dad
to do anything like this.

33:45.568 --> 33:46.933
A few times.

33:47.336 --> 33:49.770
- Seven.
- Well, I'm not doing it for you.

33:49.839 --> 33:52.205
Nicky, please,
please, you gotta do it, please?

33:52.274 --> 33:54.003
And, hey,
could you give her this check for me?

33:54.076 --> 33:57.443
No, I'm not gonna go into a hotel
and give a tranny hooker a check!

33:57.546 --> 33:59.309
She's not a hooker.

34:00.649 --> 34:02.014
You make it sound so dirty, Nick.

34:02.118 --> 34:05.087
Well, what the hell is it, pat,
if it's not dirty?

34:05.187 --> 34:07.280
- Different.
- Stop the car!

34:08.056 --> 34:09.752
Don't stop the car, okay?

34:09.824 --> 34:12.793
Wait, where you going? Wait, Nick!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

34:13.094 --> 34:16.428
Come here. Please. Come on, man.

34:16.498 --> 34:20.025
- I really... I really can't do it.
- Patrick, listen to me.

34:20.369 --> 34:23.338
You are going to be
a United States senator.

34:24.139 --> 34:27.974
You're gonna occupy
one of the highest offices in the land.

34:28.043 --> 34:32.105
Don't you, as a future u. S. Senator,
at least have to have enough courage,

34:32.181 --> 34:35.275
enough integrity,
to walk into a hotel room on your own

34:35.351 --> 34:36.909
and give a tranny hooker a check?

34:37.018 --> 34:39.748
- She's not a hooker!
- I know she's not a hooker, okay?

34:39.822 --> 34:42.449
But is she more of a man than you are?

34:48.864 --> 34:52.493
You're right. Okay. Thanks, Nick.

34:52.568 --> 34:55.536
The Ashley square. Let's go, baby.

34:56.705 --> 34:59.731
And just for the record,
that was not life and death!

35:00.509 --> 35:02.875
I know you two had a thing once.
So what was it, Nick?

35:02.945 --> 35:04.879
She was upset about Freddy and I...

35:04.947 --> 35:07.507
I said some things to be nice
and she was just... it was friendly.

35:07.616 --> 35:09.345
It looked like a lot more
than friendly to me!

35:09.418 --> 35:11.886
- Well, look, she's about to get married!
- That means a lot!

35:11.954 --> 35:14.218
And, anyway, I told you, I quit!

35:15.991 --> 35:18.289
Who's that? Whose ring is that?

35:19.562 --> 35:22.122
It's... it's Karen's.

35:23.933 --> 35:27.096
Look, it's not what you think.
It's Daisy's idea of a joke, okay?

35:27.203 --> 35:29.865
And it's oddly helpful.

35:40.182 --> 35:42.412
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:47.756 --> 35:49.883
Karen, do not call me
on the home phone number.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.792
We have to talk, Nick.
It's about your dad.

35:55.764 --> 35:57.493
Freddy asked me for $ 100,000

35:57.566 --> 36:00.535
at the party tonight
to join some golf club.

36:00.603 --> 36:02.628
Don't. Please, I know.

36:03.906 --> 36:06.204
So, I went up to the office
to write a check,

36:06.275 --> 36:08.766
and when I got there,
I found a new requisition on my desk.

36:08.844 --> 36:09.970
Yeah, from whom?

36:11.580 --> 36:12.740
Brian.

36:15.217 --> 36:17.845
The last gift Brian requisitioned
from the foundation

36:17.920 --> 36:20.821
was for a man named Norman Exley.

36:20.890 --> 36:23.051
- Well, who's that?
- Brian said he was just some guy,

36:23.159 --> 36:24.990
he was down on his luck and
came into the church,

36:25.060 --> 36:26.527
he wanted to settle some debts,

36:26.595 --> 36:30.554
so I sent him a check for $ 10,000
three months ago.

36:30.633 --> 36:31.657
And now he's asking for more?

36:31.734 --> 36:34.294
Yeah, only this time it's for $90,000.

36:34.670 --> 36:35.830
And...

36:37.373 --> 36:40.069
- What?
- Nick, he's an airplane mechanic.

36:43.746 --> 36:47.045
- Karen, what the hell are you saying?
- I don't know.

36:47.750 --> 36:51.516
Brian, well, he never was very happy
about the affair.

36:52.988 --> 36:54.421
What affair?

36:54.690 --> 36:58.251
The one your dad and my mom had
for the past 40 years.

37:03.165 --> 37:04.826
Oh, God, Nick.

37:06.769 --> 37:08.532
I thought you knew.

37:23.347 --> 37:24.712
Two days later,

37:24.815 --> 37:26.680
my father's plane
was finally recovered

37:26.750 --> 37:28.650
from the bottom of long island sound,

37:30.354 --> 37:31.981
without him in it.

37:34.058 --> 37:36.219
It could have been explosives.

37:38.062 --> 37:39.529
Could have been?

37:39.597 --> 37:41.656
Look, that plane's been
bouncing around the ocean floor

37:41.732 --> 37:43.359
for the past two weeks now.

37:43.434 --> 37:46.665
That's why there's no body in it,
that's why there's no real proof.

37:46.737 --> 37:48.102
I'm sorry.

37:48.172 --> 37:51.335
I'd be happy to get a warrant
for Exley, see where it leads.

37:51.408 --> 37:53.273
But the da's
probably gonna want to know

37:53.344 --> 37:55.904
where you're getting
your information from.

37:55.980 --> 38:00.280
- I'll be in touch. Thank you.
- Hey, Mr. George.

38:00.718 --> 38:03.619
There was a watertight lock box
on the plane.

38:04.154 --> 38:06.054
We found this in there.

38:09.526 --> 38:12.393
- Personal effects.
- Thank you.

38:35.452 --> 38:39.980
- What are you doing here, Tripp?
- Karen called me. I got concerned.

38:40.624 --> 38:42.114
Well, there's...

38:43.127 --> 38:45.425
A lot to be concerned about, I guess.

38:45.496 --> 38:49.125
Maybe. Might all amount to
nothing, though.

38:49.199 --> 38:53.363
Sometimes, you know,
you're just looking for answers

38:54.538 --> 38:56.301
and there aren't any.

38:56.740 --> 38:58.002
Either way...

38:58.976 --> 39:00.500
Oh, God.

39:02.613 --> 39:04.376
Come here. Come here.

39:09.253 --> 39:11.278
Hell of a way to lose him.

39:11.789 --> 39:12.847
Yeah.

39:13.090 --> 39:17.618
Whatever you want to do, Nicky,
we're on your side.

39:18.262 --> 39:20.822
Whether you're working for us or not.

39:21.065 --> 39:24.330
Is that your way of asking if I still want
to work for you or not, Tripp?

39:24.401 --> 39:28.735
You know me.
I can't help putting it out there.

39:29.940 --> 39:32.807
- I thought he took that with him.
- Well, he did.

39:32.876 --> 39:34.969
It was in a waterproof box.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.904
Oh.

39:40.918 --> 39:42.010
Okay.

39:45.522 --> 39:49.788
- Listen, I gotta go. My family's waiting.
- Oh, you take the helicopter.

39:49.860 --> 39:51.885
I mean, traffic's demonic.
You'll never get there.

39:51.962 --> 39:54.089
Call your car service,
tell them to go home.

39:54.164 --> 39:57.725
I wanna stay here for a minute.
Police will take me back.

39:58.736 --> 40:00.499
Take the helicopter.

40:03.273 --> 40:05.366
I'll see you in the morning.

40:07.945 --> 40:09.810
See you in the morning.

40:11.215 --> 40:12.341
Good.

40:14.718 --> 40:16.345
I love you, Nicky.

40:25.796 --> 40:29.129
So, is the love of money
really the root of all evil?

40:30.367 --> 40:32.335
Or is it something else?

40:36.039 --> 40:38.098
Is it the love of freedom?

40:38.776 --> 40:40.505
Cupcake! Wait a second!

40:40.644 --> 40:42.202
- Leave me alone, daddy!
- Why are you doing this?

40:42.279 --> 40:45.043
I only get one life,
and I have to make it mine.

40:45.949 --> 40:47.576
Someday is today.

40:49.186 --> 40:50.551
Let her go.

40:52.089 --> 40:53.647
She'll be all right.

40:55.759 --> 40:57.659
Okay, go for it, kiddo.

41:00.898 --> 41:02.866
- I love you.
- I love you.

41:05.769 --> 41:06.793
The love of fame?

41:06.870 --> 41:10.533
No, seriously, Ethan, you should
come down and check it out.

41:10.607 --> 41:12.074
Well, because I value your opinion.

41:12.142 --> 41:13.575
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with this thing

41:13.644 --> 41:15.111
before my dad makes me sell it.

41:15.179 --> 41:17.545
Hey. We should hit
the Bahamas, maybe?

41:17.648 --> 41:20.515
I gotta get back though
before I go to space camp.

41:21.552 --> 41:22.712
Ethan?

41:24.021 --> 41:26.546
- Dude?
- Is it the love of virtue?

41:26.623 --> 41:29.183
It's not about the money, you idiot!

41:29.259 --> 41:33.628
I want our son to go to the school
that he would go to if we were together!

41:33.730 --> 41:36.096
Well, they won't take him at the school
if he's not mine!

41:36.200 --> 41:38.065
Fine, then he's yours!

41:39.169 --> 41:41.797
Congratulations, baby, you're royalty.

41:43.073 --> 41:44.438
Andrea.

41:44.508 --> 41:47.136
Wait, I can't just bring him home
to my wife and kids!

41:47.211 --> 41:48.337
The love of vice?

41:48.412 --> 41:50.573
Please don't leave me, paddy.

41:51.348 --> 41:54.317
I'll do something terrible, I know it.

41:57.054 --> 41:58.487
It's okay.

42:01.425 --> 42:04.053
- I'm here.
- Is it the love of romance?

42:04.828 --> 42:08.195
They're gonna make a whole line
of kids golf videos to start.

42:08.265 --> 42:09.391
And if that goes really well,

42:09.466 --> 42:11.957
they're gonna do the same thing,
only in Japanese.

42:12.035 --> 42:16.734
And I'll be the spokesperson, kind of,
you know, the face of the whole thing.

42:16.974 --> 42:20.205
It'll just cost $ 1 million upfront to start.

42:20.277 --> 42:21.767
It's a good idea, right?

42:21.845 --> 42:24.006
Yes. Yeah, it's a good idea.

42:24.114 --> 42:26.674
Or is it having too much of anything?

42:27.117 --> 42:30.086
Is that the problem? I don't know.

42:30.187 --> 42:33.315
I just know I'm gonna find out
who killed my father.

42:34.397 --> 42:38.654
And when I do, they're gonna pay.
