WEBVTT

00:00.584 --> 00:02.377
But the girl she was sitting next to

00:02.377 --> 00:05.380
had contact with just about
everyone who's gotten sick.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.965
Daisy, what's inside Miranda

00:06.965 --> 00:09.384
kills faster than any known disease.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.261
William put it there.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.181
- No, that's bullshit!
- Tell me William's other name.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.184
Zanzinger is Martin Jamieson, the
biological father of Daisy Markovic's baby.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.270
Daisy, I am so sorry.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.065
There's no hope?

00:23.774 --> 00:25.567
It turns out we're not the
only ones looking for him.

00:25.692 --> 00:26.568
Who else?

00:26.693 --> 00:29.071
Oh, you name it. The South
Africans, the Pakistanis.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.197
Why Pakistan?

00:30.280 --> 00:32.573
I don't know yet, but wasn't
that scientist that was murdered

00:32.698 --> 00:35.661
- outside your office, wasn't she...
- Hira Kahn, yeah.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.163
I've got a lead on a sample
of the Spanish lady.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
From where?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.166
It's a long story.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.876
Oh, you're fucking beautiful.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.796
The Spanish Flu.
We got it, David.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.172
- We got it?
- We got it.

00:47.965 --> 00:48.799
It's her.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.176
I almost died when I saw it.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.095
Miranda.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.763
So, we should be looking
for Chiernegin,

00:54.888 --> 00:56.181
he's the one behind Miranda?

00:56.265 --> 00:59.560
He's behind taking
what came out of Fort Egan

00:59.685 --> 01:02.980
and turning it into something
that's far more deadly

01:03.063 --> 01:05.190
and I'm sure he's not going
to stop there.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.068
The temperature spikes up to 105,

01:08.193 --> 01:10.362
lungs are 93% filled with fluid.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.365
You ever see a virus that virulent?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.992
This is what came
out of Denver?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.577
That's what you sent.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.787
No. No.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.080
What? Jill?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.582
What is it?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.585
It's the fucking 1918 Spanish Flu.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.086
You're thinking Hira.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.963
If Chiernegin got to her
and she did cross the line,

01:28.297 --> 01:31.592
- a man like that would want her dead.
- Why would he go after David?

01:31.967 --> 01:32.676
You're right.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.762
I think it would be a good idea that
we put some security around David.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.681
I really fucked up this time.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.978
David, he was hit by a car.

01:42.978 --> 01:46.273
A cab. He's in the hospital in a coma.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.566
What?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.359
Go to 360. Clear.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.279
Okay, go home, pack your long johns

01:52.362 --> 01:54.072
and catch the next flight up there.

01:54.198 --> 01:55.282
- Fuck.
- What?

01:55.574 --> 01:58.368
I don't know what's worse:
thinking some terrorist released this flu

01:58.493 --> 02:01.371
or that the head scientist for NorBAC did.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.789
Fuck.

1x13- The Longest Night

04:41.365 --> 04:43.075
Hi there.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.076
Hi.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.788
Constable Johnson.
Welcome to Iqaluit.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.790
Thank you, I'm Jill from NorBAC.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.668
And, is he at home, do we know?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.962
- Well, there's only one way to find out.
- Okay.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.387
Joe, it's Matty Johnson.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.681
Joe?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.103
Come on, Joe.
You've got visitors.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.482
Joe?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.777
Go put your shorts on,
we're coming in!

05:19.403 --> 05:21.989
- He's a bit of a nudist.
- Excellent.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.867
Joe!

05:26.493 --> 05:28.996
Come on, Joe, make
yourself presentable.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.474
Fuck.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.398
Is that Joe?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.570
Better not
touch anything.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.581
Joe.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.001
Joe, if you're there
pick up, okay?

06:16.168 --> 06:19.171
Look, I need you to go out
and see if the body's still there.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.590
And don't touch it, okay?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.385
Do you know the caller?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.597
Yeah, it's my boss.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.901
Sandstrom, what the hell
are you doing?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.402
This hotel sucks.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.571
- Oh my God, sit down.
- Oh, get off of me.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.491
Are you crazy? You've been out
of a coma for only 6 hours.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.493
- And I'm fine.
- Sit down! David!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.203
- Ow! Ribs! Ribs!
- Sorry.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.288
- What's going on in Denver?
- It's in good hands.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.873
Has the outbreak been contained?

06:54.998 --> 06:57.793
- No, not yet.
- I'm going to have to get back to work.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.586
No. David, you need to get to bed.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.589
There's no fucking way
you are leaving this hospital, David.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.894
David, will you please just take
one of those?

07:17.896 --> 07:19.481
I caused it, Mayko.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.482
What?

07:21.400 --> 07:24.278
- I let it out.
- What? What are you talking about?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.364
The Spanish Flu.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.992
I'm responsible for
the outbreak.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.077
David, you're not making
any sense.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.163
The flu sample
that I got,

07:35.163 --> 07:38.292
the one that Jill and I
sequenced, it wasn't sent to me.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.295
I stole it.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.796
What?

07:43.881 --> 07:45.382
I went to Nunavut.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.594
There was a body,
frozen, buried in the...

07:48.969 --> 07:51.972
A miner who died of
the Spanish Flu in 1918

07:51.972 --> 07:54.266
and I dug him up
without permission.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.894
I took a sample.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.980
Wait. So, you're saying Denver...

08:00.772 --> 08:04.484
It's the same fucking flu, look.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.076
I... I don't get it. How did
your flu get to Denver?

08:13.285 --> 08:14.494
I don't know yet.

08:14.870 --> 08:18.498
Well, then maybe it's like
some weird coincidence.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.294
Right. The Spanish Flu
kills 40 million people,

08:22.377 --> 08:24.963
it dies out, 80 years later.
I dig it up,

08:24.963 --> 08:27.174
a few months after that it
starts killing again.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.968
It's not a coincidence, Mayko,
it's a fucking train wreck.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.096
Nepal... Chernobyl...

08:33.263 --> 08:34.972
- Sandstrom.
- Okay, okay.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.600
There are 8 segments
in the virus.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.394
Let's sequence every one and
just make sure.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.397
I don't need to see 8 segments
to know what I'm looking at.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.776
Denver is a perfect match
to Nunavut.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.404
- You're jumping to conclusions.
- You're wasting time.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.991
We need a vaccine,
not an alibi.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.786
Okay, well I'm going to
sequence the whole viral genome.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.788
We're going to need it for
vaccine anyway.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.999
We're going to have to get
every flu lab in the world on this.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.001
David, if Caroline finds out...

09:04.169 --> 09:06.380
She's not going to find out. Here.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.883
I'm going to tell her.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.074
David?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.286
Hey.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.174
I was on my way to the
hospital to give you this.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.682
David?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.893
- What are you doing here?
- What?

10:00.976 --> 10:01.977
They let you out?

10:02.186 --> 10:03.896
I've got something to say.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.399
Me first. Sit down.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.866
I found records of
payments you made to Joe Okalik,

10:15.991 --> 10:17.868
your source for the Spanish Flu.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.078
We thought he screwed up

10:20.204 --> 10:23.290
when he exhumed the body, so we
needed to know who he was.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.001
Now you know.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.086
You broke the law

10:28.504 --> 10:30.506
and scientific protocol.

10:31.089 --> 10:34.176
Jill just forwarded to me the
emails you sent him.

10:34.468 --> 10:37.679
He was looking for that body
for 14 months.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.890
More like 2 years.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.895
I've been trying to get in
touch with him.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.979
He's dead.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.566
The flu?

10:49.775 --> 10:50.984
No.

10:51.193 --> 10:54.780
He'd been drinking. He fell
in the shower, hit his head.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.076
Morrison.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.702
Hey, Jill.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.372
I'll put you on speaker.
David's here.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.375
- She's in Nunavut.
- Oh, Jesus.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.502
I was at the grave, David.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.171
The grave's been dug up.
There were polar bear tracks.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.172
Oh, fuck!

11:12.506 --> 11:14.800
You said it.
Most of the body is gone.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.593
Good work, Jill.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.304
Thanks. I'll call you back.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.766
We put it all back, Caroline.
Every stone, I swear to God.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.102
That... that grave
was perfectly covered.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.396
You disturbed it for a few minutes.

11:27.479 --> 11:28.981
The smell gets out,

11:29.106 --> 11:30.983
a hungry polar bear happens by.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.484
I don't want to hear it!

11:33.193 --> 11:34.194
From now on

11:34.278 --> 11:36.488
you're going to share everything you've got,

11:36.488 --> 11:38.490
all your research on the Spanish Flu,

11:38.699 --> 11:41.368
with the 5 top vaccine labs in
the world.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.280
David, are you okay?

12:31.668 --> 12:32.878
What's he doing here?

12:33.003 --> 12:37.299
He gets in a car accident and now
he thinks he let out the Spanish Flu.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.466
So, everybody know?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.177
- They know your hypothesis.
- Sure.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.973
You're going to coordinate
the dissemination

13:25.973 --> 13:27.975
of all the material
we have on the Spanish Flu.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.894
Here's Caroline's list.
We're going to go wider.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.273
There's a graduate student in
the Philippines who wants to help.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.191
She's more than welcome.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.194
You and I are going to get
rolling on a vaccine. Mayko?

13:39.278 --> 13:40.988
- I'm going to Denver.
- Why?

13:41.196 --> 13:43.699
There's no epidemiological
proof it links to Nunavut, David.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.701
The genetics match, Mayko.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.370
But patient 0 doesn't.
Something's wrong.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.372
Maybe it has nothing to
do with Nunavut,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.207
God, and nothing to do with you.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.169
Listen, I understand why you... Fuck.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.879
You okay?

13:59.381 --> 14:00.883
Let's get to work.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.386
All right, thanks, Mayko. Call
me as soon as you talk to Bishop.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.804
Okay, bye.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.390
Thanks for holding.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.392
Can we get back to you?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.271
Okay. Thank you, bye-bye.

14:14.605 --> 14:17.107
This is the Denver report.
No overnight deaths.

14:17.191 --> 14:20.068
Oh, good. University of Tokyo.
Give it to Carlos.

14:23.906 --> 14:24.489
Jill.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.576
Okay, no reports of people
here with any kind of flu.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.077
Do we have a list?

14:29.203 --> 14:31.872
Yeah, all the people who've flown in
and out of here in the last 14 days.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.373
I'll fax it to you
from the lodge.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.584
- How many names?
- About 250.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.170
You see, the thing is this is
the middle of nowhere,

14:38.170 --> 14:39.588
but people come here from all
over the world.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.673
Baltimore, Lima, Chicago,

14:41.798 --> 14:43.091
New York, Dublin,

14:43.175 --> 14:44.676
- Tel Aviv...
- Denver?

14:44.801 --> 14:47.179
- No Denver.
- So, how did it get there?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.473
Well, maybe someone
in Baltimore

14:49.473 --> 14:51.892
who'd been to Nunavut had a
visitor from Denver?

14:52.184 --> 14:55.395
And Baltimore died and
was misdiagnosed.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.774
Or, Baltimore comes down with
the Spanish Flu and recovers,

14:58.899 --> 15:02.277
but first passes it on to Denver who
flies home, infects half the airport...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.071
- Half the airport, right.
- And keels over.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.906
Jill, we need
you back here.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.783
- All right.
- Safe flight.

15:12.788 --> 15:15.582
Prophylactic antivirals.
They're already using them in Denver.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.501
How do they know they've got
the right ones?

15:17.584 --> 15:20.170
The antivirals needs to be
tailored for the Spanish Flu.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.381
What do you suggest?
N-inhibitors?

15:25.592 --> 15:27.094
Zanamivir!

15:27.970 --> 15:30.305
The Department of Agriculture
has tested it on mice,

15:30.305 --> 15:31.682
they had a lot of success with it.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.977
- Yeah, they tried Oseltamivir too, Bob.
- Only in Petri dishes.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.480
Fuck it, try them both, only
we're going to need a 2nd front.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.899
- Any ideas?
- Just one.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.695
M2 ionic channel inhibitors.
If we're lucky we'll fuck up

15:44.778 --> 15:48.198
the virus' inner workings and
get the little bastards in their sleep.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.868
Do you want me to get that
to the CDC too?

15:54.079 --> 15:54.997
Yeah.

16:05.174 --> 16:08.677
They turned the old airport into a...
What do you call it ?

16:08.886 --> 16:11.388
Hazmat City ? 600 in quarantine.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.806
How many sick?

16:13.182 --> 16:15.184
Twelve are in
serious condition.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.977
Are you making any headway?

16:17.394 --> 16:20.772
I don't think your patient 0's
really the 1st victim.

16:21.982 --> 16:25.694
Jimmy Cooper, here,
was one of the first to die.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.988
He's our patient 0
as far as we're concerned.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.699
- How'd he get it?
- Still investigating.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.994
Now, did he or any of the
early patients come into contact

16:34.077 --> 16:35.787
with someone who's up in Nunavut?

16:35.996 --> 16:37.206
- Nuna-what?
- Nunavut.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.790
It's in northern Canada.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.667
You think this virus came
from way up there?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.794
It's an hypothesis,
hopefully a dumb one.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.005
I need to talk to
Jimmy's family.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.507
That's... part
of the problem.

16:46.507 --> 16:49.593
No family in town,
he was single, no roommates.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.677
Friends?

16:51.595 --> 16:55.098
We've got Alex Epstein, Jake Ferguson,

16:55.098 --> 16:57.392
Doug Kennedy, Carl Osmanson.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.686
It's his poker buddies,
all dead.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.106
- And no clue how he got it?
- Not so far.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.108
Any relatives of the
poker players?

17:05.108 --> 17:08.403
Well, maybe Osmanson's wife.
Just got out of quarantine.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.177
- You son of a bitch.
- I know. I broke every ethical,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.596
moral and scientific rule
in the book.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.807
I should've told you where
I got the sample from.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.476
You think that's
why I'm pissed at you?

17:39.685 --> 17:40.769
I don't know.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.397
David, I am pissed at you because
we could've had a vaccine by now!

17:44.189 --> 17:47.693
If you had let me share the strain
with other labs months ago...

17:47.901 --> 17:48.986
Fuck, Jill.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.572
It's your fucking ego,
that's why I'm pissed.

17:51.697 --> 17:53.699
And I'm pissed at myself,
because I didn't push you.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.077
I didn't push you to do the right thing,
and that makes me just as guilty as you are!

17:57.202 --> 17:58.203
Sorry.

17:59.079 --> 17:59.997
I'm sorry.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.373
Fuck...

18:02.082 --> 18:03.584
How's your head?

18:04.501 --> 18:06.795
I know what an anvil
feels like.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.090
Come on, let's fix this.

18:14.178 --> 18:15.888
Denver's already begun
the antiviral treatments,

18:15.971 --> 18:17.472
but nothing seems to be working.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.391
Oh... What are they doing?
Just back up.

18:19.474 --> 18:23.770
The usual: masks, troops,
wash your hands and pray.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.481
- It's good to have you back, Jill.
- Thank you, Wes.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.610
We have 3 more deaths,
all young.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.778
Why is this hitting so many
young people?

18:31.904 --> 18:34.198
'Cause they haven't had as
much exposure to flu streams.

18:34.198 --> 18:36.408
The older you get,
the easier it is to fight it off.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.077
Okay, so where are we
on a vaccine?

18:39.203 --> 18:41.788
Trying to culture the virus
to produce the viral proteins.

18:41.997 --> 18:46.210
If we can do that, we can test
the proteins to cause immunity in humans.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.297
If it triggers the immune system
to produce antibodies to fight the virus,

18:50.380 --> 18:52.674
- then we are in business.
- And if it doesn't?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.676
We're gonna have to shut down
the entire city.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.971
It should've been done last week,
anyway. What's going on in Nunavut?

18:58.096 --> 19:01.600
Uh, the cops are still trying
to find the remains of the miner's body.

19:01.683 --> 19:05.395
They've got trackers with dogs and the
armed forces have planes up there too.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.607
If we don't find that body,
we could have another outbreak.

19:08.774 --> 19:09.983
Yeah, okay.

19:10.484 --> 19:12.694
Bob, Carlos, Jill, you're with me.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.488
I'll be there in a second, David.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.575
We have all the travellers
to and from Nunavut.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.077
We've tracked everyone down
except for one,

19:20.202 --> 19:22.579
a Michael Stepanovich, from Newark.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.498
The address on his
customs form doesn't exist.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.500
Track him by his passport.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.169
We did. It gave us a different address:
Brooklyn, another dead end.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.796
The New Jersey and the New York DMV,

19:30.796 --> 19:32.673
neither of them have
a licence issued to that name,

19:32.673 --> 19:34.591
and a credit check
turned up nothing.

19:34.675 --> 19:35.884
Birth certificate?

19:36.009 --> 19:38.595
His passport said that
he was born in the former Yugoslavia.

19:38.679 --> 19:41.306
I have contacted the embassies
of Croatia, Slovenia,

19:41.390 --> 19:44.810
Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro,
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.395
What a nightmare.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.481
I'm waiting to hear back
from all of them, but my guess is that--

19:49.606 --> 19:52.192
- Michael Stepanovich doesn't exist.
- Exactly.

19:52.693 --> 19:53.986
Hang on...

19:54.403 --> 19:55.988
Stepanovich...

19:56.405 --> 19:59.283
Okay, Joe Okalik had the word "stop"

19:59.283 --> 20:01.702
with the time written
on his calendar.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.080
I'm gonna call the lodge
where I stayed.

20:05.581 --> 20:07.875
Wait, you remember the number?

20:08.292 --> 20:10.377
I dialed it a couple
of times, yeah.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.174
Maisie? Hi, it's Jill Langston
from NorBAC.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.177
The flight was lovely,
thank you.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.304
Listen, I have a couple
of quick questions for you.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.598
Did a Michael Stepanovich stay
there, at the lodge?

20:23.682 --> 20:25.684
What was he doing up there?

20:26.685 --> 20:29.271
Okay, do you remember
what he looked like?

20:30.898 --> 20:31.690
Great.

20:31.899 --> 20:34.276
Thank you very much, Maisie.
Okay, bye-bye.

20:34.902 --> 20:39.198
Well, beard, accent,
Russian or Polish,

20:39.281 --> 20:42.701
mid-60's. He was booked for a few
days, but he left after one night.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.870
- I'll look into it.
- Thanks.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.498
Good work.

21:21.406 --> 21:24.284
Michael Stepanovich, older
Russian or Polish guy,

21:24.409 --> 21:27.079
travelled to Nunavut.
We think he met with Joe Okalik.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.374
Okalik winds up dead.
Spanish Flu breaks up in Denver.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.000
Now Stepanovich can't be found.

21:32.793 --> 21:33.794
How'd Okalik die?

21:33.877 --> 21:36.088
Drunk. Fell in the shower,
hit his head.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.507
That's funny, there's
an old KGB trick where they bash

21:38.590 --> 21:41.093
the guy in the head and pump his
neck full of pure alcohol.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.803
It's crude, but the combination
does the trick.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.305
It doesn't sound like
something Chiernegin would pull.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.182
No, but maybe that's
why he did it.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.810
Check the veins in his arms and
his legs. If I'm right,

21:49.810 --> 21:52.271
the alcohol content would be
much lower in his arms.

21:52.271 --> 21:54.606
Then check his stomach, you'll
find there's no booze there at all.

21:54.773 --> 21:55.607
Okay.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.985
Here you go, guys.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.491
Listen, where did that mystery
man use his alias last?

22:04.575 --> 22:05.909
I don't know, but...

22:07.494 --> 22:10.706
His ticket puts him on the ground
at La Guardia.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.083
After that, nothing.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.587
All right, then I'm off
to New York City, then.

22:16.587 --> 22:18.881
- Look, I gotta fly, all right?
- Okay.

22:19.298 --> 22:20.591
- See you.
- Yeah.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.509
Thanks, Dig.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.303
No problem.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.982
Hey, you're late, babe.

22:37.691 --> 22:38.609
Late?

22:38.692 --> 22:40.694
But worth the wait.
Get changed.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.404
Or are you in your
costume already?

22:42.571 --> 22:45.908
No, no, no: I called earlier, I'm with
NorBAC, Dr. Mayko Tran.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.284
Oh, yeah. Margie, uh...

22:47.284 --> 22:48.702
She's in the dressing room.

22:48.785 --> 22:50.704
This is the undressing room.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.706
Is this flu thing
gonna end soon?

22:52.789 --> 22:54.583
'Cause another week of this
and I'm forcut.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.001
My heart goes out to you.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.009
What do you think? I got the idea

23:04.092 --> 23:06.512
- 'cause of the flu thing. It's cute, huh?
- Very.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.681
Margie, if you don't mind,
can we get back to this?

23:09.806 --> 23:11.808
Because your husband could be
a very important link here.

23:11.892 --> 23:14.895
Had he ever been in contact
with anyone from Nunavut?

23:15.187 --> 23:16.772
- Where?
- Canada?

23:16.772 --> 23:18.190
Never been to Canada.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.776
He was in Korea
for a war or something.

23:20.776 --> 23:22.611
The other men who died,
the poker players:

23:22.694 --> 23:24.404
any of them travel anywhere
in the last 2 weeks?

23:24.488 --> 23:26.281
I doubt it,
they're all losers.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.909
Alex Epstein, the lawyer.
Maybe he travelled.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.203
Lawyer? Nah,
he was disbarred.

23:32.579 --> 23:35.707
- It was nice meeting you.
- One second. Musicians travel.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.210
You mean Jimmy? They fired him.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.879
Imagine not being good enough
for a punk band?

23:41.004 --> 23:43.799
Oh, at his funeral, it was cute:
they towed his hearse.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.008
Sorry?

23:45.008 --> 23:47.678
He drove a tow truck, so the
boys towed his hearse.

23:47.886 --> 23:50.597
- But he was unemployed.
- He worked on the side.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.485
Bob, what have you got?

24:05.112 --> 24:06.488
Bad news.

24:06.697 --> 24:08.282
Bob...

24:09.408 --> 24:11.285
- Two more pieces.
- And?

24:11.410 --> 24:12.995
Denver still
matches Nunavut.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.580
- Good.
- Good?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.583
We're looking for a vaccine, right?
We're looking to see

24:17.708 --> 24:20.586
if what we've learned about the Spanish
Flu, can help us nail them, right?

24:20.711 --> 24:22.379
But it'll nail you too.

24:23.172 --> 24:25.299
Bob, get over it.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.888
Yeah, Jimmy Cooper.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.390
Hell of a guy. Musician.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.476
He was in a punk band
or something.

24:38.395 --> 24:39.104
So...

24:39.313 --> 24:41.190
You live in Canada?

24:41.398 --> 24:42.399
Yeah...

24:42.691 --> 24:45.611
- Yeah. Now, this Jim--
- You got a boyfriend up there?

24:46.778 --> 24:47.696
No.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.490
He's here in Denver,
with me.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.076
Can't try a guy for knocking.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.204
The thing is, Andre,
I'm trying to establish

24:55.204 --> 24:57.372
a connection between Denver
and Nunavut, up north.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.874
Jimmy never went north.

24:59.082 --> 25:00.792
He never went nowhere.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.295
He was a basement kind of guy.

25:03.295 --> 25:06.381
Oh, well, could he have come into contact
with someone travelling from the north?

25:06.507 --> 25:07.799
Yeah, maybe. Deep Blue.

25:07.799 --> 25:08.592
What's that?

25:09.301 --> 25:12.304
Deep Blue Discount, Reynolds,
out at the airport.

25:13.013 --> 25:14.806
If they break down,
we pick'em up.

25:17.392 --> 25:19.895
Digby, it's Caroline.
Where are you?

25:19.978 --> 25:22.397
Deepest, darkest Queens,
that's where I am.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.900
Let me tell you, Caroline,
20 min outside Manhattan,

25:24.983 --> 25:28.195
it's like another time zone.
It's like the 1950's out here.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.113
You onto something?

25:30.197 --> 25:32.491
Yes, I am. Michael Stepanovich
isn't who he says he is.

25:32.491 --> 25:34.701
His real name is
Radavan Mihalech.

25:35.077 --> 25:37.788
He's part of the Serbian mafia
down in the United States.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.208
He flew up to Iqaluit to do
some illegal big game hunting.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.794
I guess Joe promised him
a polar bear or something.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.588
Anyway, he was only up there for
a day, didn't get to bag the bear.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.174
Flew back down to New York,
and then to off to Belgrade

25:49.299 --> 25:51.510
to do some... "family business".

25:51.802 --> 25:53.804
- Did you talk to him?
- No, not yet.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.473
But we have some agents trying
to track him down in Belgrade.

25:57.474 --> 25:58.684
Damn.

26:03.689 --> 26:04.606
David.

26:04.982 --> 26:07.985
Sorry. I was going over
Bob's sequecing

26:08.110 --> 26:11.697
and the virus has mutated more
significantly than we thought,

26:11.697 --> 26:14.408
and some of it looks
suspiciously like avian flu.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.078
Avian flu, combined with the
Spanish Flu from the corpse?

26:18.203 --> 26:19.705
- Something like that.
- David.

26:20.789 --> 26:21.999
Michael Stepanovich

26:21.999 --> 26:23.792
has no connection to Chiernegin.

26:24.293 --> 26:26.211
I never thought he did.
Thank you, Caroline.

26:26.295 --> 26:27.379
Show me, Jill.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.799
Okay. Did you wanna...
Do you wanna sit?

26:30.799 --> 26:32.384
No, it's okay, I'll stand.

26:35.888 --> 26:39.600
Okay, a bird virus,
it's not unheard of.

26:39.892 --> 26:40.601
Okay...

26:40.976 --> 26:43.478
- Maybe patient 0 is a chicken farmer.
- Right.

26:43.687 --> 26:46.607
And he picks up the avian flu
from his chicken,

26:46.690 --> 26:49.109
but it doesn't make him ill.
He goes to Nunavut,

26:49.193 --> 26:51.904
picks up the Spanish Flu from the corpse
and then the 2 exchange genes or...

26:51.904 --> 26:53.989
Whoa, whoa, whoa: let's come
at it from the other way.

26:53.989 --> 26:55.991
Let's say the bird got into the
corpse up in Nunavut,

26:55.991 --> 26:57.701
got the Spanish Flu there.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.495
And the 2 flues combined in
the bird. That makes more sense.

27:00.704 --> 27:04.082
How does the bird, in Nunavut, pass it
on to that poor fucking sap in Denver?

27:04.583 --> 27:06.877
- Birds migrate.
- Which bird and where?

27:07.002 --> 27:09.379
Millions of birds, are they
spreading it between one another?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.798
Multiple carriers.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.301
It's a fucking nightmare.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.889
- David, please sit down.
- No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.599
Good work, Jill.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.500
Thanks a lot.

27:56.510 --> 27:58.011
I saw the fucker.

28:00.180 --> 28:01.014
Daisy.

28:01.598 --> 28:03.600
I went back to Cape Town.

28:03.809 --> 28:06.186
I was gonna call you
but I didn't.

28:06.395 --> 28:09.398
Then I read that you were hit by
a car and wanted to come.

28:09.481 --> 28:10.983
How are you?

28:11.191 --> 28:13.277
- Fine.
- You look awful.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.404
I feel awful.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.698
They found him.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.409
- Yeah, I heard.
- He's dead.

28:21.076 --> 28:24.413
They asked me if I wanted
to go identify the body.

28:24.496 --> 28:25.581
I said no.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.710
The man I knew never existed.
It was a lie.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.088
I lived a lie for a year
and 3 months,

28:33.088 --> 28:35.090
how fucking stupid am I?

28:35.382 --> 28:36.383
Come inside.

28:36.508 --> 28:38.385
Then I thought that
I would go see him,

28:38.510 --> 28:40.512
rip his fucking balls off.

28:41.096 --> 28:44.474
And so I flew 25 hours and
I saw him in a drawer.

28:45.684 --> 28:47.186
He looked different.

28:48.103 --> 28:50.189
A beard, short hair...

28:51.398 --> 28:52.774
It wasn't him...

28:53.692 --> 28:56.486
But it was.
It was, but it wasn't, you know?

28:57.404 --> 28:58.989
Just a corpse.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.908
Another fucking corpse.

29:00.991 --> 29:03.410
All I have are corpses.

29:03.994 --> 29:06.788
I buried my baby
and I buried my parents.

29:07.289 --> 29:11.210
What kind of person would want to
see another corpse? I mean, am I sick?

29:11.293 --> 29:14.296
- You're exhausted.
- Will I ever be normal?

29:15.589 --> 29:17.508
You were honest
with me once.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.177
Please tell me the truth:
will I ever be normal?

29:20.302 --> 29:21.512
Yes.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.515
- Yes.
- How do you know?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.393
Because you're innocent, Daisy.

29:29.978 --> 29:32.606
Because people can survive
the worst things.

29:34.608 --> 29:36.485
It's in our genes.

30:42.009 --> 30:43.886
Perfect timing.

30:45.012 --> 30:49.016
- We need a horse.
- No horse, I just brought vodka.

30:49.099 --> 30:51.101
Vascyli, what are
you doing here?

30:51.685 --> 30:54.980
You sounded like shit on the phone.
Now I understand why!

30:55.105 --> 30:57.107
You look like shit!
What happened, David?

30:57.191 --> 31:00.485
It's what happens when you
don't look both ways. Come in.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.614
Here, look at this.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.381
I let it out, Vascyli.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.511
Then have a drink.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.098
It's a little too early for me.

31:31.808 --> 31:34.478
So what is the outbreak?

31:36.104 --> 31:37.898
It's bad.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.778
The Spanish Flu with
avian genes.

31:42.986 --> 31:44.279
Avian?

31:44.404 --> 31:46.490
Is it man-made?

31:47.282 --> 31:48.909
Natural.

31:51.286 --> 31:54.498
Yeah... There was a time
when the Kremlin

31:54.498 --> 31:57.876
wanted us to explore the
Spanish Flu,

31:59.086 --> 32:02.214
Really?
Did you get anywhere with it?

32:03.507 --> 32:05.509
Chiernegin wouldn't touch it.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.804
Why not?

32:08.887 --> 32:10.097
Why?

32:10.389 --> 32:13.892
Why are you having
problems with it now, huh?

32:14.017 --> 32:16.895
It's recombining so fast
we can barely keep up with it.

32:16.979 --> 32:18.605
There you go.

32:19.690 --> 32:23.402
You know, it's a funny girl,
this Spanish lady.

32:23.485 --> 32:27.281
She's got a mind of her own.
Very much like you, David.

32:27.698 --> 32:28.699
Fuck.

32:31.201 --> 32:33.579
Now, look, we drink and we talk.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.789
- Okay.
- What are you trying?

32:36.790 --> 32:39.001
- Everything.
- Antivirals?

32:39.501 --> 32:41.295
Zanamivir tent,

32:41.795 --> 32:44.298
- Oseltamivir tent...
- How about

32:44.381 --> 32:48.093
- M2 ion channel inhibitors?
- Not yet.

32:48.886 --> 32:50.304
Am I missing something?

32:50.387 --> 32:52.014
Are people still dying?

32:53.307 --> 32:54.391
Yeah.

32:54.808 --> 32:57.186
Then you're
missing something.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.481
What the fuck have I done, Vascyli?

33:02.482 --> 33:04.902
Something even

33:04.902 --> 33:08.197
Chiernegin would never imagine.

33:17.998 --> 33:20.000
So, where are you
off to now?

33:20.292 --> 33:23.086
First I go shopping,
then I go airport.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.713
Shopping, what for?

33:24.880 --> 33:27.382
Only thing to get in Canada, David.

33:27.591 --> 33:29.009
Cuban cigars.

33:34.598 --> 33:37.601
Listen, you'll... you'll call me
if you can think of anything else?

33:38.018 --> 33:39.186
Of course.

33:40.896 --> 33:42.189
Have a safe trip.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.690
Dasvidania.

33:46.902 --> 33:48.695
You lied to me!

33:48.779 --> 33:49.988
You lied!

33:50.197 --> 33:52.199
- I trusted you!
- What're you doing?

33:52.282 --> 33:53.909
- Who are you? I trusted you!
- What do you...?

33:54.117 --> 33:55.994
- You know him!
- Who?

33:56.078 --> 33:57.788
- Who?!
- You know...

33:58.205 --> 34:00.290
The man in the taxi, him!

34:00.499 --> 34:02.501
- Who? Vascyli Popov?
- Yes!

34:04.294 --> 34:06.213
Daisy, I don't understand
what you're saying!

34:06.296 --> 34:08.005
He's the doctor that
did the amnio,

34:08.090 --> 34:11.510
he's the doctor that put that
fucking virus in my baby!

34:12.511 --> 34:13.594
Oh, my God.

34:15.597 --> 34:18.183
Caroline, Vascyli Popov
is Chiernegin.

34:18.183 --> 34:20.601
- What are you talking about?
- Daisy just saw him.

34:20.601 --> 34:21.395
Daisy?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.813
She says he's the one
who put the virus in Miranda.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.190
I don't think... He's on his way
to the airport, just get him!

34:27.609 --> 34:29.194
Okay, okay, it's over.

34:29.695 --> 34:30.779
It's okay...

34:33.489 --> 34:35.199
He's gone.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.418
Did you get him?

34:44.710 --> 34:46.003
Not yet.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.297
What's this?

34:49.505 --> 34:51.382
Well, I figured you're
not getting any sleep,

34:51.507 --> 34:53.302
so I thought I'd buy
you an espresso.

34:53.594 --> 34:55.679
- Double?
- Triple.

34:57.097 --> 34:58.682
Nice.

34:59.016 --> 35:00.601
How is Daisy?

35:00.601 --> 35:02.603
As you'd expect.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.693
How are you?

35:14.406 --> 35:16.617
I guess you were right
about Vascyli, huh?

35:17.910 --> 35:20.996
Do you think Popov is behind
the Spanish Flu?

35:22.789 --> 35:24.082
No.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.878
What?

35:30.589 --> 35:35.010
He says I told him about Nunavut
one night when we got drunk together.

35:35.511 --> 35:36.803
Did you?

35:37.095 --> 35:39.097
I can't remember.

35:43.393 --> 35:45.479
It doesn't matter, Caroline.
I can't see it.

35:45.896 --> 35:48.398
I mean, this outbreak in Denver,
it's a natural strain,

35:48.398 --> 35:49.900
that's not his style.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.694
Then again...

35:57.199 --> 35:58.492
Mayko's back.

36:10.212 --> 36:12.089
Okay, I have good news:

36:12.089 --> 36:15.092
we've been looking
at the wrong patient 0.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.094
It wasn't Jimmy Cooper.

36:17.094 --> 36:19.596
Jimmy moonlighted
as a tow truck driver.

36:19.680 --> 36:23.100
The day before he died, he assisted
a woman named Fletcher DeBear,

36:23.183 --> 36:25.602
who was headed out
on a camping trip with her girlfriend.

36:25.894 --> 36:28.605
The rental car was found at
the foot of a trail.

36:28.689 --> 36:30.899
Didn't take long to find the bodies.

36:31.692 --> 36:34.319
We estimate they died
the night they got there,

36:34.319 --> 36:37.698
before Jimmy the tow truck
driver died. And this Fletcher

36:37.781 --> 36:40.200
turns out to be a bird tagger
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

36:40.492 --> 36:42.411
She is patient 0.

36:42.786 --> 36:44.997
Wyomin David, not Nunavut.

36:46.081 --> 36:49.293
Sit down, Mayko. We've found
avian genome sequencing.

36:49.418 --> 36:51.503
Exactly, that's how
the bird tagger got it.

36:51.587 --> 36:53.005
How did the bird get it?

36:53.088 --> 36:54.298
I don't know.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.091
Nunavut, where else?

36:57.801 --> 36:59.720
Or maybe this is a new strain

36:59.803 --> 37:01.680
that jumped the species barrier.

37:01.805 --> 37:03.807
I mean, how do you prove that?

37:03.891 --> 37:06.393
I think I know how to prove that.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.311
David?

37:29.499 --> 37:30.584
Yeah.

37:33.086 --> 37:34.796
I figured it out...

37:35.088 --> 37:37.508
A way to find the bird
and the body.

37:37.591 --> 37:41.220
According to this report on
the bird tagger,

37:41.887 --> 37:44.681
she was replacing batteries
in GPS collars.

37:44.806 --> 37:48.018
So I looked at the last 10 birds
she did and one of them

37:48.519 --> 37:51.897
was a red-tailed hawk,
whatever the fuck that is.

37:52.105 --> 37:54.900
A large beauty, oh, about 22
inches high, with a wingspan of--

37:56.193 --> 37:56.902
Sorry.

37:56.902 --> 37:59.404
They range
from Nunavut in the north

37:59.613 --> 38:01.782
to the Western United States.

38:01.990 --> 38:02.991
Nunavut?

38:03.200 --> 38:04.701
Sorry, Mayko, patient 0

38:04.785 --> 38:07.788
was infected by this bird.
A scratch, a bite,

38:07.788 --> 38:10.999
most likely inhalation,
but this is the bird that did it,

38:10.999 --> 38:13.001
and this is the bird
we've got to find.

38:13.210 --> 38:16.004
So what I've got here is
a little piece of software

38:16.088 --> 38:19.091
that you use to track birds
with GPS collars.

38:19.299 --> 38:23.303
So a tagger gets sick from
a bird, goes camping.

38:23.887 --> 38:26.181
Infects the tow truck driver,

38:26.306 --> 38:28.100
who infects his
poker-playing buddies.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.102
And thus is born a pandemic.

38:30.310 --> 38:34.189
So, we wanna find out where our
little hawk from Wyoming has been,

38:34.690 --> 38:37.317
we just punch in his
serial number.

38:37.693 --> 38:40.821
Migrated from Nunavut. Okay,
there's his flight path.

38:40.821 --> 38:43.615
- What does that tell us?
- Nothing. But...

38:43.699 --> 38:47.119
now we bring up the flight path
for the same time period

38:47.411 --> 38:51.582
of all the other birds wearing
GPS collars in Nunavut.

38:51.999 --> 38:53.709
We do some intersection.

38:56.503 --> 38:58.088
There you go.

38:59.798 --> 39:03.302
Half of these birds,
including our little red tail,

39:03.802 --> 39:07.598
were right there,
on that spot, on the same day.

39:08.390 --> 39:09.600
Food?

39:09.808 --> 39:12.811
- I'd say a feast.
- And I'd say human remains.

39:13.812 --> 39:18.317
Contact officer Johnson in Iqaluit.
Give her these coordinates.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.612
Tell her to be extremely careful.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.618
It's amazing, David.

39:28.785 --> 39:30.495
And brave.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.190
So I just took a call from
Iqaluit, and you were right.

39:58.398 --> 40:02.194
The miner's body was right where
the GPS coordinates said it would be.

40:02.319 --> 40:06.198
And there wasn't much of it left, it
was just the bones. The bears got at it.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.617
I guess the birds had
the leftovers.

40:10.285 --> 40:12.621
Well, make sure
they know not to cull bears, eh?

40:12.704 --> 40:15.415
I mean, the bear's stomach will
kill any active virus, so...

40:15.499 --> 40:18.085
I already told
the wildlife authorities.

40:18.293 --> 40:19.002
Sorry.

40:20.420 --> 40:24.883
You alerted the local population
about the danger of contact with the birds?

40:25.217 --> 40:27.594
Not just the local population.

40:31.682 --> 40:35.310
Well, I guess now all we've
gotta do is find a vaccine, eh?

40:35.894 --> 40:37.521
- Thanks, Jill.
- You bet.

40:50.409 --> 40:51.910
Yeah?

40:54.204 --> 40:55.706
Where are you?

40:56.582 --> 40:58.083
I'm on my way.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.502
Angus McDonald, 39.

41:00.794 --> 41:02.921
Darryl Graves, 17.

41:03.005 --> 41:05.007
Darlene Evans, 30.

41:05.215 --> 41:07.384
William Jameson, 36.

41:08.010 --> 41:09.887
Miranda Markovic,

41:10.304 --> 41:12.306
3 months old.

41:13.515 --> 41:17.519
You will be charged
with 13 counts of murder.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.522
Is that all?

41:22.107 --> 41:24.693
You know so little.

41:27.404 --> 41:28.822
Fuck you.

41:37.289 --> 41:38.582
Thank you.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.809
You okay?

41:59.102 --> 42:00.187
Fine.

42:15.786 --> 42:17.412
No vodka?

42:17.913 --> 42:20.207
I don't drink
with strangers.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.211
We are all strangers, David,

42:24.419 --> 42:27.089
even from ourselves.

42:35.222 --> 42:38.392
Chiernegin married my daughter.

42:39.518 --> 42:41.520
They had a beautiful boy,

42:41.603 --> 42:44.606
Vascyli, named for his grandfather.

42:44.898 --> 42:47.109
They were killed
by the Americans, I know.

42:47.192 --> 42:49.695
A stray missile in Baghdad!

42:49.903 --> 42:51.697
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

42:53.991 --> 42:56.410
What do you care
about my family?

42:57.995 --> 43:01.498
So you assume Chiernegin's
identity and what,

43:01.498 --> 43:04.001
you help arm North Korea

43:04.084 --> 43:06.587
and Pakistan with
bioweapons programmes

43:06.795 --> 43:09.423
and then you go off and
you develop Miranda?

43:09.590 --> 43:13.010
- Just another act of justice.
- Yeah, well I was able to pick apart

43:13.093 --> 43:15.721
your justice in 2 days,
you son of a bitch.

43:15.721 --> 43:18.015
Merely an hors-d'oeuvre, David.

43:19.683 --> 43:23.312
What you gave me
was far more valuable.

43:26.690 --> 43:29.109
You gave me

43:29.193 --> 43:31.195
the Spanish Flu.

43:32.696 --> 43:35.282
What the fuck
are you talking about?

43:35.407 --> 43:39.620
You thought the nights of vodka
and conversation were about friendship?

43:39.912 --> 43:42.289
You think we were comrades?

43:42.497 --> 43:46.502
You talk very freely
when you drink, David.

43:49.296 --> 43:51.298
Jesus, it was you.

43:52.508 --> 43:55.511
You went and dug up the
body, didn't you?

43:55.511 --> 43:58.013
And I left it exposed.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.390
How sloppy of me.

44:01.099 --> 44:04.311
I let Mother Nature do the rest.

44:04.394 --> 44:08.023
The birds were my delivery system.
They spread it all over.

44:09.608 --> 44:11.818
And who knows,

44:11.902 --> 44:15.489
Denver may not be the only outbreak.

44:17.407 --> 44:21.411
We freed the Spanish Flu, David.

44:21.411 --> 44:24.414
You and I, and I thank you for it!

44:29.002 --> 44:30.921
He's taking poison!

44:31.296 --> 44:32.422
Stop!

44:43.517 --> 44:46.520
I thought you'd like to know:
the owner

44:46.520 --> 44:50.899
of the lodge in Iqaluit positively
ID'd Popov as Stepanovich.

44:51.984 --> 44:54.903
Digby's men located the
real Stepanovich in Serbia.

44:55.112 --> 44:58.407
He admitted to providing
Popov with a false passport.

44:59.908 --> 45:01.618
That's great,
Caroline, thanks.

45:02.494 --> 45:04.788
It's the missing piece
of the puzzle, David.

45:05.706 --> 45:07.416
How are things in Denver?

45:08.083 --> 45:10.294
I don't know. David...

45:10.419 --> 45:12.921
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

45:13.797 --> 45:15.799
- How many dead?
- David...

45:15.924 --> 45:17.009
How many?

45:17.092 --> 45:18.594
You didn't kill them.

45:22.222 --> 45:26.602
You can't split the atom and blame
the crew that drops the bomb, Caroline.

45:29.605 --> 45:32.024
Caroline, we need you down here!

45:32.816 --> 45:34.484
Something's going on.

45:51.585 --> 45:54.296
David, do you know
a Dr. Edwards from Oxford?

45:54.421 --> 45:56.215
Name rings a bell.

45:56.423 --> 45:58.217
Well, they've been working
with our data

45:58.300 --> 46:00.093
and they have a lead on a vaccine.

46:00.511 --> 46:03.597
I want you and Jill on a plane
to London as soon as possible.

46:04.723 --> 46:06.099
I just...

46:06.600 --> 46:09.102
I just really need to
get some sleep.

46:09.603 --> 46:11.605
- Sure, boss.
- Yeah.

46:13.524 --> 46:16.193
All of you did really, really
great work on this.

46:19.613 --> 46:21.114
Really, really
great work.

46:23.408 --> 46:25.410
I'm proud of you.

46:25.994 --> 46:27.412
Good night.

46:28.789 --> 46:33.919
~ The past is never past ~

46:34.002 --> 46:39.716
~ Just razor dew in a glass ~

46:39.800 --> 46:42.219

46:42.219 --> 46:45.097

46:45.222 --> 46:49.893

46:50.018 --> 46:55.315
~ Take me over ~

46:55.399 --> 47:00.612
~ Take me over it again ~

47:01.196 --> 47:06.410
~ Take me over ~

47:06.493 --> 47:12.499
~ Take me over it again ~

47:12.791 --> 47:15.502
It was the last one, guys.

47:15.794 --> 47:20.299
Hope you enjoyed it. We did.
Thanks to all who helped.
