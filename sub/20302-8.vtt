WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.253
NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues…

00:03.336 --> 00:05.797
I think it is the gun
that shot Hill and Renko.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.425
-Yeah.
-Watch out! Watch out!

00:08.508 --> 00:11.052
-(tires squealing)
-(car crashing)

00:11.136 --> 00:12.429
A butcher and his apprentice

00:12.512 --> 00:14.931
are being held hostage in a meat locker
by a couple of kids.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.308
HECTOR: <i>$100,000 and a plane to Cuba.</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:18.852
Hector, that's no answer.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.979
<i>Neither is Juvenile Hall, man.</i>

00:21.062 --> 00:24.024
There's almost $20,000 worth
of choice beef in there.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.984
I'm concerned about those people in there.

00:26.067 --> 00:30.238
No Soyets, no plastique.
Just secure the scene. Period.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.365
Whatever you say, Frank.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.285
But, you know, that kid in there
ain't exactly Beaver Cleaver.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.162
HECTOR: <i>You want a hostage so bad?</i>

00:37.245 --> 00:40.331
<i>-Well, I'm gonna give you one right now.</i>
-(gunshots)

00:40.415 --> 00:43.209
Well, it wasn't exactly
an exchange of gunfire.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.545
They, uh… They shot up some meat.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.798
Please don't say anything
to inflame the situation.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.093
Captain, let's try not
to manage the news, shall we?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.345
Who the hell cares
what happens to me, huh?

00:54.429 --> 00:57.182
Me. I care, Hector.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.815
-(indistinct station chatter)
-ESTERHAUS: Item nine.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.193
Item nine.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.654
As regards the midday sightings

01:11.738 --> 01:16.117
of various Hill Street personnel
in and around the premises

01:16.201 --> 01:20.455
of one Tung Ho Oriental
Massage Parlor on Elmwood…

01:20.538 --> 01:23.208
(scattered chuckling)

01:23.291 --> 01:26.961
Be forewarned, said on-duty recreating

01:27.045 --> 01:29.297
is strictly prohibited

01:29.380 --> 01:33.718
per Code 3, Paragraph A
of Divisional policy.

01:33.802 --> 01:37.097
-MAN 1: Right.
-MAN 2: I knew that.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.474
ESTERHAUS: Item 10.

01:39.557 --> 01:43.895
The black van file, still open and active.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.731
The most recent assault being…

01:47.690 --> 01:51.069
the robbery of a suburban father of four,

01:51.152 --> 01:53.822
marooned for over three hours yesterday

01:53.905 --> 01:56.658
on the median divider
of the Crosstown Expressway.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.911
As with the other victims,
the only item of clothing left him

01:59.994 --> 02:01.079
were his socks.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.706
(scattered snickering)

02:03.790 --> 02:08.336
Be reminded, the description
of said assailants has been modified,

02:08.419 --> 02:11.881
from six large males
to three female prostitutes.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.552
You will note their descriptions
on the second section of

02:15.635 --> 02:17.554
Officer Hingle's handout.

02:18.596 --> 02:23.434
You will also note that that black van
is not necessarily black,

02:23.518 --> 02:26.187
but merely an M.O.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.983
So, let's be observant out there,

02:30.775 --> 02:34.404
and endeavor to apprehend
these individuals.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.365
Item 11.

02:38.741 --> 02:42.245
Because of his need
for volunteer counselors,

02:42.328 --> 02:46.916
one or two minutes shall now be allotted
to Lieutenant Howard Hunter,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.168
concerning…

02:48.251 --> 02:50.128
HUNTER: Camp Guadalcanal, gentlemen.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.381
(unimpressed muttering)

02:56.050 --> 02:57.218
Thank you, Sergeant.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.847
Camp Guadalcanal, gentlemen.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.976
Where the ghetto streets end
and manhood begins.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.438
Where democracy plays one-on-one
with the domino theory,

03:08.521 --> 03:11.191
and protective reaction is not
just a fourth-down call.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.525
MAN: Hike!

03:12.609 --> 03:16.404
Now, as some of us already know,
Camp Guadalcanal is run by this department

03:16.487 --> 03:19.949
in conjunction with the local army
Special Forces volunteers.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.619
Where, and for how long?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.332
For three electrifying summers

03:27.415 --> 03:30.126
in the wild interiors
of Allegheny State Park.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.920
(murmuring, scoffing)

03:32.003 --> 03:34.339
I'm not gonna waste your valuable time,

03:34.422 --> 03:35.256
and mine,

03:35.340 --> 03:37.926
by going into the short strokes,

03:39.260 --> 03:43.681
but as you can see,
our regimen, as always,

03:43.765 --> 03:46.267
is the same heck of a turn-on.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.605
Four intensive weeks
of physical conditioning,

03:50.688 --> 03:52.398
including field maneuvers,

03:52.482 --> 03:55.735
full-equipment 10K, hand-to-hand combat,

03:55.818 --> 03:59.030
along with our traditional
classroom disciplines

03:59.113 --> 04:01.115
of third-world topographies,

04:01.199 --> 04:05.119
elementary infiltration,
and a teen guide to Rommel.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.789
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:07.872 --> 04:09.958
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:10.041 --> 04:13.795
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:20.843 --> 04:24.764
(theme music playing)

05:21.904 --> 05:24.782
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:26.200 --> 05:27.869
(phone ringing)

05:35.084 --> 05:36.627
What gives, Henry?

05:36.711 --> 05:39.380
I'm trying to write
a letter to Chief Daniels.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.341
The man is certifiable, Alf.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.761
He belongs in the V.A. hospital,
under maximum sedation.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.721
I don't know about that, Henry.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.931
I'd cool off
before I did anything I'd regret.

05:49.015 --> 05:52.143
I don't care. Do not think that the man
is not dangerous, Alf, because he is.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.605
Those are kids he's trying to make
into military gangsters.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.774
-Alf, Henry.
-ESTERHAUS: What's the trouble?

05:58.900 --> 06:01.944
For openers, my dry cleaners
burned down last night.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.946
Four suits gone. Up in smoke.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.700
Not the brown modified tweed
with the little blue specks?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.578
The highlight of your wardrobe, Francis.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.121
Frank, I'm a 39 Regular,

06:12.205 --> 06:14.415
in case you need something
to hold you over.

06:14.499 --> 06:17.335
I'm a 46 Regular, Frank,
depending on the cut.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.253
Hey, it's okay. Thanks.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.588
Don't worry about it.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.131
Worry about this.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.967
"Ling Ling Gives Birth to Panda Twins"?

06:25.051 --> 06:28.721
-No, no, Phil. That one.
-"Merchants Form Urban Coalition.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.350
Dekker Avenue Merchants Association
vows to fight crime"?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.435
Sounds well-intentioned, Francis.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.978
GOLDBLUME: I didn't know
they had an association.

06:36.062 --> 06:39.023
Neither did they,
until that news team showed up.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.193
She was down there covering
that supermarket stickup. Remember?

06:42.276 --> 06:43.528
Swanson called this morning.

06:43.611 --> 06:47.490
Seems our Ms. Chase did a vigilante story
on the six o'clock news.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.284
-Life follows video.
-Listen, she's gonna be around here

06:50.368 --> 06:52.036
quite a lot the rest of this week,

06:52.120 --> 06:54.497
finishing up
that precinct documentary of hers.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.208
So, let's try to monitor
her activities. Okay?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.918
Aw, gee, Frank,

06:59.001 --> 07:01.671
I'd hate to have us accused
of managing the media.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.632
What I guess I mean is, uh…

07:04.715 --> 07:09.137
you'd just like us to provide
her with a little guidance.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.139
Well put, Henry.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.852
Listen, Eddie Hoban sits
for that lie detector test

07:15.935 --> 07:18.354
this morning at ten o'clock, I think.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.357
So let's start calling down there
for the results around 11:30, okay?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.484
Right, Francis. You want this?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.611
No, you be aggravated for a while.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.783
(phone ringing)

07:34.370 --> 07:37.790
Sarge, I got a couple of messages for you.

07:37.874 --> 07:38.916
This guy, I don't know.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.752
He wanted to know
if you'd gotten his card yet.

07:41.836 --> 07:46.007
He didn't want to leave a number,
and his name is Kermit Trench.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.301
That is a "K" on there. (chuckles)

07:50.178 --> 07:51.679
Kermit Trench.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.390
Kermit Trench?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.767
Is he out?

08:06.360 --> 08:09.363
(clamoring)

08:18.039 --> 08:20.416
Hey! Everybody shut up and stand still.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.251
(yelling): I said shut up!

08:23.753 --> 08:25.796
(normal volume):
Mr. Viatoro, what's going on?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.382
-We want this punk arrested.
-CROWD: Yeah! That's right!

08:28.466 --> 08:30.968
Mr. Arcanian here caught him
ripping off a fifth of tequila

08:31.052 --> 08:32.261
from his liquor department.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.555
Not the first time, either,
the little punk's hit me.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.224
Epstein, Mrs. Miles,

08:36.307 --> 08:38.809
tell him about your cash register,
what he did.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.229
Grabbed the key from me
and opened the drawer.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.438
Take your hands off me!

08:42.522 --> 08:45.650
-I didn't do nothing!
-(all clamoring)

08:45.733 --> 08:47.485
ESTERHAUS: All right. Easy, easy!

08:47.568 --> 08:50.029
-FURILLO: Hold it.
-Settle down!

08:50.112 --> 08:51.864
-MAN 1: Settle down.
-MAN 2: Settle down.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.075
-FURILLO: Put the kid in Holding.
-Yeah, I got him.

08:54.158 --> 08:57.453
(all clamoring)

08:59.622 --> 09:03.167
Mr. Viatoro, since you seem--
Hold it. Turn off the camera.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.545
Turn it off, and take a seat in my office.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.297
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-COMPLAINANT 1: Why can't she do it?

09:08.381 --> 09:11.050
-Please, Ms. Chase. Let's go. Come on.
-COMPLAINANT 2: Afraid?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.344
COMPLAINANT 3:
Don't want her to film it, is that it?

09:13.427 --> 09:14.262
In the office.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.305
-You people are always saying…
-Hushing it up.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.892
Since you seem to be in charge here,
would you like to give me one good reason

09:19.976 --> 09:22.019
why I shouldn't arrest
each and every one of you?

09:22.103 --> 09:25.940
(overlapping angry protesting)

09:26.023 --> 09:27.149
Talk to me.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.610
Okay, this is nothing personal here, okay?

09:30.194 --> 09:32.113
I mean, we know how hard it is.

09:32.947 --> 09:36.993
The fact of the matter is,
you guys can't protect us. Okay?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.954
-That's right.
-We can't go on the way we are.

09:40.037 --> 09:43.374
So, we formed this association.
This is only a part of us.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.751
WOMAN: The Dekker Avenue
Merchants Association.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.169
Protective Association.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.714
We're not leaving this
building till that kid gets booked,

09:49.797 --> 09:51.882
and we get sanctioned
by the police department.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.885
-That's right.
-FURILLO: Okay, that's clear, I hear you.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.347
Uh, Phil, would you please
show Mr. Viatoro and his group

09:58.431 --> 10:01.309
into the roll call room, please.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.228
All right. Let's move
along downstairs, folks.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.941
(shouting): We can interface
more comfortably down there.

10:09.025 --> 10:13.404
Everything will be spoken about
and taken care of.

10:13.487 --> 10:17.199
All right. Come on. Let's…

10:17.283 --> 10:19.619
WOMAN: What kind of a thing is roll call?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.456
Captain, we're not just making noise here.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.582
Know that.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.296
-Ray, would you get me Division?
-Okay.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.395
RENKO: I figure they'll start Hoban off
with easy questions.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.190
What's the capital of France?
How many grams in an ounce of smack?

10:49.273 --> 10:51.359
But when they start talking
about that shooting,

10:51.442 --> 10:54.654
that needle's gonna jump off the graph
as sure as Hawaiians fry pineapple.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.822
Well, I don't know.
I read a lot about polygraphs

10:56.906 --> 10:59.241
and believe me,
they're not that conclusive.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.036
Don't believe everything you read.
It's money in the bank.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.580
Okay, right here on the left?
That's my dentist's office.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.957
I know. I know.
You've only been coming to see this guy

11:07.041 --> 11:09.293
every Tuesday morning, like clockwork.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.711
You got a problem with that?

11:11.837 --> 11:14.340
We're touchy this morning, aren't we?

11:14.423 --> 11:17.677
I was just thinking that
with all the renovation he's doing,

11:17.760 --> 11:20.971
you still look like
the same old Renko to me,

11:21.055 --> 11:22.223
I'm sad to say.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.350
Well, it's just defensive orthodontia.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.686
Just some subtle readjustment
in the Renko bite.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.771
You know how women feel
about the Renko bite.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.692
Yes, I sure do. They say it's…
(blows raspberry)

11:32.775 --> 11:34.610
-Thanks a lot.
-(laughing)

11:34.694 --> 11:36.570
I'll pick you up later on.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.867
The Renko bite. (scoffs)

11:46.414 --> 11:47.581
I don't know.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.710
He says nothing's different,
but I've got a real keen radar

11:50.793 --> 11:52.962
for that sort of thing,
and ever since this new woman

11:53.045 --> 11:54.463
come into his life…

11:57.049 --> 11:58.217
I don't know.

12:01.512 --> 12:05.516
Do you suppose that
you might be experiencing some jealousy?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.643
(scoffs)

12:07.727 --> 12:09.854
Jealous? Me? Uh-uh.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.815
How can I be jealous of
someone I never even met? Uh-uh.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.318
(sighs): No, that's not it.
See, this is how it is.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.654
Bobby and me,
we been real close for a long time.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.614
We used to do everything together.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.159
We double-dated,
we went out and played racquetball,

12:23.242 --> 12:26.120
we went to bars
and got all crazy and did everything.

12:26.203 --> 12:30.249
But, suddenly,
he won't even talk to me about her.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.753
And when I say, like,
let's go out and have dinner or something,

12:33.836 --> 12:36.005
he just gets kind of weird on me,
it's like…

12:37.173 --> 12:40.301
It's like he's trying to cut,
cut me out of his life or something.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.431
Maybe he's afraid that you won't like her?

12:45.514 --> 12:48.601
Won't like her?
Now what kind of question is that?

12:48.684 --> 12:52.188
Won't like her?
She's his squeeze, not mine.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.732
All I'm suggesting…

12:55.566 --> 12:56.734
is that two men,

12:57.401 --> 12:58.903
as close as you are,

12:59.695 --> 13:02.656
who have to trust each other
and depend on each other.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.494
There's a lot of love between you,
and I think that your disapproval

13:06.577 --> 13:08.287
would be very painful to him.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.124
(sighs)

13:13.083 --> 13:14.418
Well, I can't see it.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.254
No, I just can't see it at all.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.633
-Why don't you ask him?
-Because it's not the reason.

13:21.717 --> 13:22.843
It's something else.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.470
It's gotta be.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.859
WASHINGTON: Thought you were gonna
stay in last night, man.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.611
-I did.
-Mm-hmm.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.532
That Brazilian chick came over
with some jays and a fifth of rum.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.327
-Can you get anything down yet, honey?
-(sighs)

13:48.410 --> 13:50.663
-(chuckles)
-Got a special today on I.V. units.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.457
(chuckles) Bring him
a chilled tomato juice with lemon,

13:53.541 --> 13:56.460
Tabasco and a fresh grapefruit
on the side, will ya, babe?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.879
-How you doing, Daphne?
-Hello there, little heifer.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.047
How are ya?

14:01.632 --> 14:04.468
You're looking a little off-color there
this morning, J.D.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.637
You know, I hate cop hangouts.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.932
-(groans) So, is that Friday night?
-Yeah. They're gonna play the Celtics.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.559
I tell ya, it's gonna be a good game.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.394
Maybe you and your lady
would like to come.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.771
I'll get a chance to meet
the future Mrs. Hill.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.357
No one's rushing into anything, cowboy.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.484
How about Friday night?

14:20.568 --> 14:23.320
Thanks, but we're kinda tied up.
You know, the family.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.824
Would you take a look at this?
This happens every time I come in here.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.035
I swear, do you hose this place off
every time I come in here?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.204
WOMAN: Do you want a refill?

14:32.288 --> 14:36.041
-(sighs)
-You must have had one mean session, man.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.836
You've been in a foul mood
ever since that appointment.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.796
I'm just concerned about this Hoban thing.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.465
I wish they'd get their act together
and get that boy to trial.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.385
-I could save this city a lot of money.
-You'll get your day in court.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.554
Especially now plainclothes
caught him for you.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.764
Why don't you let it be, Harris?

14:50.848 --> 14:53.601
Hey, anything you say, booga, booga.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.897
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Harris.
Who you calling booga, booga?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.481
Hey, what's the big deal, Renko?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.775
Give us a break.
I heard what you call him.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.736
It's 'cause he's my partner, Harris!

15:03.819 --> 15:04.820
He's my main squeeze,

15:04.904 --> 15:07.615
and I can call him anything I want to,
and he can do the same with me.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.533
You try it,
and I'm gonna change your face.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.702
-MAN: Renko, take it easy.
-Get your hands off me.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.954
Santini, you better stay loose,
or you and the mouth

15:14.038 --> 15:15.664
won't last one month up on the Hill.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.917
Let's see if we can get us some fresh air.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.209
Why don't you do that?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.508
Oh, man.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.219
I ain't never coming in here again.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.473
Come on.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.810
So, what you gonna have, huh?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.940
(distant phones ringing,
typewriters clacking)

15:58.332 --> 16:00.542
Harris was most abusive.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.045
The taller one, Harris,
called me every name in the book.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.171
I wasn't resisting.

16:04.254 --> 16:06.173
I was just trying
to explain something to him,

16:06.256 --> 16:09.510
-and he wouldn't listen to me.
-Mr. Krinsky has a medical problem

16:09.593 --> 16:12.096
which required his making
two trips to the men's room.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.931
We have medical affidavits.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.017
Now, this arresting report alleges…

16:17.101 --> 16:20.980
This is total, fabricated garbage.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.107
I am not interested in little boys.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.901
I just use the public bathroom
in the park.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.320
The doctor told me to walk.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.823
-(paper ripping)
-All right.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.243
I'm sorry. We owe you one, Mr. Krinsky.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.287
But in the future,
do us both a favor, please.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.082
Get yourself a medical card and carry it.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.460
-Leo, get him a ride, please.
-Right away.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.130
I hope we can meet again,
under more pleasant circumstances.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.424
LEO: It'll be just a minute, Mr. Krinsky.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.969
What's with that kid in there?
It seems to me we both just witnessed

16:52.052 --> 16:54.930
an assault on that child
by your Dekker Avenue vigilantes.

16:55.014 --> 17:00.185
Ah, excuse us, please.
That kid in there is a very big problem.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.604
We bust him,
turn him over to the Youth Authority,

17:02.688 --> 17:05.024
and they spit him right back
out onto Dekker Avenue.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.527
Under the circumstances,
I'd say they exercised a lot of control.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.572
What's it gonna be with him?
You're not going to book him.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.824
You haven't even investigated the charges.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.201
Gonna let his parole officer
take care of that.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.455
-That's assuming he's guilty.
-He is. Repeatedly.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.833
I suppose Hector Ruiz
is an angel by comparison.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.753
Two market holdups, five hostages.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.171
He's different.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.090
You mean, you chose to make him different.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.135
What's happening with him anyway?

17:33.218 --> 17:38.474
I'm working on a change of facility.
So far, six turndowns.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.851
You ought to send that out right away.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.354
The older the stain,
the harder it is to, uh…

17:45.147 --> 17:46.774
Sort of like relationships.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.109
Is that a warning or an observation?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.779
I'm having one of those
philosophical days.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.199
-Got to once in a while.
-Yeah, me, too.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.159
My cleaners burned down last night.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.994
Four suits gone, poof.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.831
Not that brown tweedy thing
with the little blue specks?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.000
-Uh-huh.
-That's a blessing.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.879
-Hey.
-Look, you've got a birthday coming up.

18:08.962 --> 18:11.256
Suppose we go down to Charles St. Ives?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.966
Charles St. Ives?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.385
I can't even afford one of his hangers,
much less--

18:15.469 --> 18:17.346
Charles St. Ives?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.515
I'm not your ex-husband, Counselor.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.684
-Joyce's treat.
-I don't think so.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.062
I'm a big boy.
I'm used to dressing myself.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.439
Undressing is another matter.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.818
I really hate
that stubborn streak in you, Furillo.

18:30.901 --> 18:33.195
-No, you don't.
-Excuse me.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.322
Your office on line five, Ms. Davenport.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.576
-You can take it on my phone.
-Thank you. Yes, I do.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.625
Ray's got Commander Swanson
on seven, Frank.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.211
We didn't think you'd want to take it
in your office.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.630
Ray filled him in
on that sanctioning business.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.344
-Furillo.
-(Swanson on phone indistinct)

18:57.427 --> 18:59.096
FURILLO: It can't wait for that, Dave.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.932
I've got the 6:00 news
locked in my office,

19:02.015 --> 19:05.144
and 12 angry citizens
cooling their heels in roll call.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.563
<i>Frank, you can handle it, can't you?</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

19:07.646 --> 19:11.233
Don't tell me to handle it, Dave.
That's a policy decision,

19:11.316 --> 19:13.819
and policy is not made on precinct level.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.904
<i>Listen to me,</i>
<i>this is policy decision, and…</i>

19:15.988 --> 19:17.906
No, you listen--

19:17.990 --> 19:21.118
<i>Will you just talk to them, please?</i>
<i>You take over--</i>

19:22.077 --> 19:24.454
Henry, go downstairs and tell them

19:24.538 --> 19:27.166
I'm waiting for a decision on policy
from Division.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.625
For real?

19:28.709 --> 19:31.378
With that news camera in there,
he doesn't have much choice.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.922
(man mumbling indistinctly)

19:34.006 --> 19:36.008
Phil, would you get me that

19:36.091 --> 19:38.427
Neighborhood Watch literature,
if we still have it?

19:40.596 --> 19:41.930
Phil, I'm talking to you.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.808
Could you repeat that please, Francis?

19:44.892 --> 19:50.814
-Uh, I know where it is. I'll do it.
-Oh, oh, excuse me.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.149
(sighs)

19:56.904 --> 19:59.573
(indistinct station chatter)

20:16.506 --> 20:19.384
In future,
your activities within this precinct

20:19.468 --> 20:24.181
will conform to what does not
obstruct or complicate our jobs,

20:24.264 --> 20:26.600
not what's good for the six o'clock news.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.811
In other words, you're limiting my access.
You're manipulating the news.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.273
Oh, no. But while we're on
the subject of manipulation,

20:33.357 --> 20:37.694
those 12 citizens downstairs would never
have dreamed of forming a vigilante group

20:37.778 --> 20:40.030
unless somebody put the idea
into their heads.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.242
That somebody was you
on your news special last night,

20:43.325 --> 20:44.785
so I'm told.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.037
Good timing. It happens.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.207
That hardly justifies you trying to alter
the reality of this event.

20:50.290 --> 20:53.543
Oh, climb off it. You alter reality
every time you point a camera at it.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.963
What about that market stickup
two days ago?

20:56.046 --> 20:59.675
You tried to turn that into a protest
for Puerto Rican statehood.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.886
May I interpret that to mean that
you're against Puerto Rican statehood?

21:02.970 --> 21:03.845
Not bad.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.932
You do have a gift
for steering conversation.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.310
Is this the old shift
to the soft sell, Captain?

21:11.895 --> 21:14.898
Look, what bothers me about you,

21:14.982 --> 21:18.318
and about cops in general,
is you don't seem to want to turn around,

21:18.402 --> 21:21.196
stop for a minute, and find out
who your friends really are.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.366
-You, for instance.
-Maybe me.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.785
But the people downstairs definitely are.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.121
They're good people. They're on your side.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.248
All they want
is what they've got a right to have.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.749
And you're not giving it to them.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.168
They can't walk down a street
day or night.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.421
How can you blame them
for doing what they're doing?

21:37.504 --> 21:41.008
If you owned a business on Dekker Avenue,
you'd be out there in front of the group.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.217
Maybe I would.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.177
But that's not the issue.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.972
The point is, those people are not cops.

21:47.055 --> 21:50.851
Suppose they lock horns with, say,
the Gypsy or-or the Blood…

21:50.934 --> 21:52.811
or-or the Dragon, or--

21:52.894 --> 21:55.731
not to mention the 11 other gangs
using Dekker Avenue.

21:55.814 --> 21:58.650
You're underestimating the power
and competency of these people.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.695
And I think you underestimate
how ugly it can get out there

22:01.778 --> 22:03.322
and how fast it can happen.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.701
So, you're not gonna sanction
this merchants group, are you?

22:07.784 --> 22:09.703
You're just gonna cool them off down there

22:09.786 --> 22:11.371
-and send them home.
-No.

22:13.248 --> 22:16.001
Division wants us to reinstitute
a Neighborhood Watch.

22:16.084 --> 22:19.671
Oh, great. That program's a joke,
and you know it.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.049
-It's the biggest scam in town.
-It helps us.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.675
It appeases them.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.470
Well, suppose we just
take the time to find out?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.930
That's not a hell of a lot to ask, is it?

22:36.313 --> 22:38.148
Bernard, would you set up downstairs?

22:38.231 --> 22:40.150
-The captain will be down in a minute.
-Got ya.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.234
Okay?

22:44.112 --> 22:47.324
You're still here.
I'd call that a victory of sorts.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.868
I would call it more like
a temporary cease-fire.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.287
He thinks that I provoked
the Dekker Street merchants.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.581
-Is he right?
-Someone had to.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.250
You mind if I didn't hear that?

22:58.251 --> 22:59.628
What do you know about him?

23:01.671 --> 23:04.049
I don't know. What's to know about him?

23:04.132 --> 23:07.302
-Is he married?
-I think he used to be.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.847
I'm not wild about his taste in suits,
if that's any help.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.058
If he weren't a cop…

23:14.518 --> 23:15.519
I…

23:18.563 --> 23:19.398
(chuckles)

23:19.481 --> 23:21.650
Well, I'll see you later.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.240
(indistinct station chatter)

23:30.909 --> 23:32.619
Still here, Counselor?

23:32.702 --> 23:36.623
Charles St. Ives.
Six o'clock appointment, Furillo.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.624
Frank.

23:37.707 --> 23:41.420
Excuse me, Ms. Davenport.
I just called downtown.

23:41.503 --> 23:45.549
-Hoban's lie detector is inconclusive.
-Hoban?

23:45.632 --> 23:48.385
He's the one who pulled the trigger
in the Hill and Renko shooting.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.637
Yes. We're turning him loose.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.764
What about possession of heroin?

23:52.848 --> 23:56.268
It was not on his person,
so they will not prosecute.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.020
See if you can raise
Hill and Renko for me.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.107
And when Harris and Santini come back,
tell them I want to see them, too.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.108
All right.

24:10.824 --> 24:13.869
(group muttering, unimpressed)

24:17.372 --> 24:21.042
Captain, hear this.
We're not just going home.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.087
We're gonna continue organizing
and getting our cause on television.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.757
Because this…
This is an insult to our intelligence.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.427
We're gonna get carry permits
and the power to make arrests.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.970
With or without your backing.

24:35.307 --> 24:39.227
Like I said before,
it's nothing personal, Captain.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.646
It's just gotta get done.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.648
Miss Chase.

24:48.028 --> 24:51.239
Andy, find your partner
and come to my office.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.076
Well, I don't believe it.
He couldn't have.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.579
So it goes, Renko.
It's the way it lays out.

24:57.662 --> 25:01.082
So, big deal. So, he Zens out
and passes some dumb lie detector test.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.043
What's that got to do
with him going to trial?

25:03.126 --> 25:05.086
There isn't going to be any trial.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.380
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.759
And the results of his tests
tip the scales just enough in his favor

25:10.842 --> 25:13.345
so that the D.A. says
we don't have a case.

25:13.428 --> 25:16.598
Circumstantial? Am I circumstantial?

25:16.681 --> 25:20.435
Is he? Twelve weeks combined
in a hospital bed, two of them in a coma.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.145
Is that circumstantial?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.439
You put me on that stand.
I'll give them a case.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.776
Bobby didn't see him,
so it's just your word against his,

25:27.859 --> 25:30.153
and believe me,
his lawyer will take your testimony

25:30.237 --> 25:32.531
and rip it to shreds
without even breaking a sweat.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.745
You know what I think?

25:39.162 --> 25:42.666
Yeah, I think I do,
so just cool down and have a seat. Okay?

25:48.421 --> 25:50.882
What's your vision,
Andy, without your glasses?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.844
Come on, that's the first question
his lawyer's gonna ask, so answer it.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.346
-20/40.
-It's 20/50.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.391
You weren't wearing glasses
when you walked in that hallway, were you?

25:59.474 --> 26:01.810
What kind of lighting was
in that hallway? Come on!

26:01.893 --> 26:04.896
Was it incandescent,
a ceiling fixture, wall, what?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.232
-It was daylight.
-Just answer the question.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.528
It was, um, it was that overhead lighting,
that kind of incandescent--

26:11.611 --> 26:13.780
It was neither, Renko.
There was no lighting at all.

26:13.863 --> 26:16.366
The windows were boarded over.
So, let's get this straight.

26:16.449 --> 26:19.369
You walked into an unlighted hallway.
You have 20/50 vision.

26:19.452 --> 26:22.163
The afternoon sun was still in your eyes,
and within two seconds,

26:22.247 --> 26:24.791
according to your own deposition,
you got smacked.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.507
I'm sorry.
It's not that I don't believe you.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.134
It's the way it plays in court.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.472
I just didn't want you to walk out of here

26:39.556 --> 26:42.350
thinking that I don't share
your anger and frustration.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.727
We all do.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.650
Just take the rest of the day off.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.740
It happens, you guys. I'm sorry.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.954
(theme music playing)

27:06.791 --> 27:08.168
(door opens)

27:13.089 --> 27:14.257
(door slams)

27:23.516 --> 27:25.268
Awful quiet in there, Bobby.

27:26.519 --> 27:29.230
I don't think I heard you
as much as clear your throat.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.025
What's there to say?

27:32.734 --> 27:34.319
Words gonna change anything?

27:35.445 --> 27:39.824
May make you easier to live with,
but let me tell you something, Renko,

27:39.908 --> 27:43.578
whatever it is that's eating at you,
I've just about had enough of it.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.624
-Oh, is that so?
-Yeah.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.586
Well, besides my life,

27:52.170 --> 27:55.632
and this lousy system I work in,
what's eating at me is you.

27:55.715 --> 27:59.344
Me? Why? Because I wouldn't lie
about seeing the shooting?

28:00.178 --> 28:01.554
I can't do that.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.350
And I told you why. Now,
if you want me to tell you again, I will.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.978
No, no, no. Actually, what's bothering me
is how you've been since then.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.730
You've cut me out of your life, man.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.442
Let me tell you, you can be one cold slice
when you want to be.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.197
My life's not my own.
You know, with Pamela and the kids.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.574
(angrily): No. I do not know Pamela.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.909
I do not know the kids,

28:22.992 --> 28:24.828
because you have not
introduced them to me.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.246
Not even once.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.750
That's not the way it is.
And you gotta understand.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.712
Understand what? My own partner
doesn't want me in his house?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.463
I am housebroken, Bobby.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.757
I haven't messed on the rug in years now.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.761
Or maybe it's her.
Maybe she just don't cotton to white boys.

28:52.313 --> 28:56.776
She is white.
And I know how you feel about that.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.737
Oh, you do, do you?

28:59.612 --> 29:02.115
That's because you know me so well.

29:02.198 --> 29:06.453
Because you're the world's foremost expert
on Andrew Renko, huh?

29:06.536 --> 29:07.412
Guys?

29:08.788 --> 29:09.789
Excuse me.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.920
I just wanted to get
in my two cents' worth.

29:16.004 --> 29:19.132
We know, Sarge. We know you know the kid.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.051
Well, maybe this isn't the time.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.095
But…

29:25.680 --> 29:29.476
I think we'd be doing ourselves a favor
if we try to consider the possibility

29:30.518 --> 29:32.645
that Eddie Hoban didn't pull that trigger.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.857
I'm just suggesting we try it.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.902
(chuckles)

29:40.195 --> 29:43.323
Seems like it hits you
everywhere you turn these days, don't it?

29:44.324 --> 29:48.870
Accept this, accept that, cope with this,
deal with that,

29:48.953 --> 29:53.583
understand where he's coming from,
identify with his situation…

29:55.877 --> 29:57.629
I swear, I don't know anymore.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.924
I just don't understand anymore.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.844
It's just words, man.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.557
-Smoke and words.
-Come on, man--

30:09.641 --> 30:11.309
No, no, that's all right. I…

30:12.936 --> 30:14.187
I can do that.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.398
I swear I can.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.617
I'll catch you all later.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.419
Sorry. I just thought
it might help a little.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.046
That's all right.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.340
(chuckling): You never know with him.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.928
I can't say that I don't blame him.

30:49.597 --> 30:52.892
(downbeat music playing)

30:56.271 --> 30:57.856
(sighs)

31:08.199 --> 31:10.869
Frank, sorry about this,

31:10.952 --> 31:13.830
but how long before you can reassemble
that Dekker Avenue group?

31:13.913 --> 31:15.790
-Why?
-We're going to legitimize

31:15.874 --> 31:17.834
-their association.
-(pencil clatters)

31:17.917 --> 31:19.544
What did you tell me on the phone?

31:20.753 --> 31:23.506
You said no, categorically no.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.675
This is straight from Chief Daniels.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.136
He wants them to have
space to work out of,

31:28.219 --> 31:30.221
two-way radios,
C.P.R. training, the works.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.223
-Gun permits?
-Soon as they qualify.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.309
Dave, this is crazy! I won't stand for it.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.978
Don't zing me, Frank. My hands are tied.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.731
You know how Daniels gets
with the media on his back.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.232
What I think's going on

31:41.316 --> 31:43.818
is he's thinking about
running for mayor again.

31:45.028 --> 31:49.157
I know. And I'm sorry.
But that's the new policy.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.827
If that's a coffee stain,
I'd put club soda on it.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.706
(door closes)

31:56.789 --> 31:58.291
Commander,

31:58.374 --> 32:01.169
are you sanctioning the Dekker Avenue
Merchants Association?

32:01.252 --> 32:03.755
-(phone ringing)
-Captain Furillo will lay it out for you.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.964
Excuse me.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.675
Hill Street.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.640
-Phil? Telephone.
-Cindy?

32:15.391 --> 32:17.226
I believe it's Trench.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.021
Let me tell him you're gone.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.399
He'll only call back.

32:23.983 --> 32:26.778
I mean gone, as in <i>muerte.</i>

32:34.243 --> 32:35.620
Esterhaus.

32:37.205 --> 32:41.125
-Move it, dog breath. Bates?
-Yeah.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.253
Can you book this garbage for me?
I gotta blow outta here. I'm late.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.714
-Mick, I got a ton of paperwork.
-You can have the collar.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.133
-That's a different story.
-Sit down!

32:50.009 --> 32:54.138
He lifted this baby
from Abe's Socialist TV and Appliances.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.599
Nice. Cute little guy, huh?

32:59.644 --> 33:03.439
-Name?
-Lewis. Robert Q.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.030
-Phil. A word?
-Of course, Henry.

33:12.073 --> 33:15.368
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but Ray took the liberty

33:15.451 --> 33:18.830
of confiding your situation to me,
and I'm-I'm concerned.

33:18.913 --> 33:22.542
Why don't you just send a unit out,
pick the guy up, and bring him in?

33:22.625 --> 33:24.794
For what? He hasn't done anything.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.799
Phil, you've got nothing to prove
by going out there.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.385
A man does what he has to, Henry.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.013
(sighing): Okay. Listen.

33:35.096 --> 33:38.224
I know you don't go much for nonfiction,

33:39.017 --> 33:40.143
but, uh…

33:42.645 --> 33:43.896
Would you consider…

33:46.482 --> 33:48.693
giving this a browse
before you make up your mind

33:48.776 --> 33:50.028
about meeting Trench?

33:51.029 --> 33:56.159
<i>-Your Kind, My Kind, Humankind.</i>
-By Helmut Shimmerfeldt.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.120
Now, it's not his best work.
It reads a little simplistically

33:59.203 --> 34:01.748
but the guy's got
some basically valid things to say

34:01.831 --> 34:05.960
about the way we men
confuse ego with duty.

34:06.044 --> 34:09.756
-A lot of it is hormonal actually.
-I don't know, Henry.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.007
Read it.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.305
-WOMAN: Sure.
-MAN: Get a cab, all right?

34:18.556 --> 34:21.267
(indistinct station chatter)

34:25.772 --> 34:27.482
MAN: Hey, how you doing?

34:35.406 --> 34:41.120
-(water running)
-Sarge, what're you doing?

34:43.664 --> 34:46.125
Ask not for whom the bell tolls, Mick.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.379
What is that supposed to mean?
Does that mean something?

34:50.922 --> 34:54.383
That means that
I have an appointment with destiny.

34:55.093 --> 34:58.471
You're going out to meet
that hair bag Trench, aren't you?

34:59.013 --> 35:00.431
Word gets around, huh?

35:01.849 --> 35:04.352
Look, I promised Debbie
I'd pick her up at art class.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.687
-Lemme cancel that and come along.
-Uh-uh.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.023
Maybe I could rip his stomach out for you.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.152
-(metal scraping)
-Okay. I'll only back you up.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.154
I don't want any piece of the collar.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.490
Mick, I appreciate your loyalty.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.700
And pound for pound,

35:19.784 --> 35:23.204
there's not another officer
I would rather have covering my dorsal.

35:24.413 --> 35:28.417
There are times when a man, if he's a man,

35:29.877 --> 35:31.629
does what a man must do.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.965
(zips jacket)

35:36.551 --> 35:38.261
Perhaps it's hormonal.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.222
(intense music playing)

36:52.585 --> 36:54.045
TRENCH: That's far enough.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.472
I've been waiting a long time for this.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.307
Make your move.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.186
I ain't armed.

37:10.269 --> 37:13.272
We both know you don't need a weapon
to kill a man, Trench.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.024
That's far enough.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.568
I only got one thing to say.

37:18.110 --> 37:19.362
Your dime.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.157
I love you, Phil.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.828
I think you've been
in the slam too long, Kermit.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.873
I mean, in a spiritual sense.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.834
I've been saved

37:34.794 --> 37:37.838
by the love of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

37:39.757 --> 37:44.345
I, uh, had what you call an epiphany

37:44.428 --> 37:45.846
up there in the stir.

37:48.099 --> 37:51.477
All them long, empty days,

37:52.186 --> 37:54.230
terror-filled nights.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.148
Men screaming.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.527
Me, lying there

38:00.569 --> 38:03.614
thinking of all the terrible crimes
I did over the years.

38:05.741 --> 38:10.037
The time we shot it out
in this alley here. Remember?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.872
Indelibly.

38:11.956 --> 38:15.793
I had to do something
to keep from going nuts.

38:16.627 --> 38:20.131
I started reading the <i>Bible.</i>
One thing led to another.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.718
I was reborn.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.473
I don't know what to say.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.350
I'll be a happy man…

38:32.351 --> 38:37.064
if you can say you forgive me
for the pain and suffering I caused you.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.650
Consider yourself forgiven.

38:44.447 --> 38:48.909
-Take it. It's my <i>Bible.</i>
-No, I couldn't. Mm-mmm.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.829
(slaps Bible in hand)

38:52.955 --> 38:55.458
(sentimental music playing)

39:02.548 --> 39:04.383
God bless you, Phil.

39:27.573 --> 39:32.036
Unarmed, unarmed,
unarmed woman coming through.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.287
Look, Mom, no gun.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.207
(police chattering, laughing)

39:39.126 --> 39:42.296
-Frank!
-Hi, Fay. How are you?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.423
I'm fine. Great stain.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.802
-Thanks for coming up here.
-I appreciate being invited.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.555
-What, am I under arrest?
-I got this kid I made a promise to.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.308
-I need a favor.
-If you're trying to bail out of taking

39:54.392 --> 39:56.352
-Frank Jr. to the basketball game--
-Whoa.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.728
I don't mean Frank Jr.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.316
He's a 15-year-old
Puerto Rican kid named Hector.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.111
He's been in and out
of Juvenile Authority since he was 12.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.863
No father, a mother who works.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.074
Mmm. That sounds familiar.

40:10.157 --> 40:12.243
Bright, gifted, and very troubled.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.495
I'm afraid if we don't get him
out of the system now,

40:14.578 --> 40:15.663
he's never gonna get out.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.623
Well, what do you want
me to do? Adopt him?

40:17.706 --> 40:19.083
He could do worse.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.587
What I'm after is a referral from Harvey
to some private institution,

40:23.671 --> 40:26.715
-something like Stony Brook in Arizona.
-Stony Brook, sure.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.176
I mean, that's a great idea, but, uh,

40:29.260 --> 40:32.012
I mean, they've got a waiting list
as long as your arm.

40:32.096 --> 40:35.599
Referrals from Juvenile Authority judges
from all over the country.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.352
You know, you really are something, Frank.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.272
You don't spend enough time
with your own son, and here you are,

40:41.355 --> 40:43.274
trying to pull off
the miracle of the century

40:43.357 --> 40:46.444
-for some street kid you don't even know.
-I do know him.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.237
And I made him a promise.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.115
Do I detect a little ego involvement here?

40:51.866 --> 40:56.745
Frank, we all make promises.
And we all unmake them.

40:58.914 --> 40:59.832
(sighs deeply)

40:59.915 --> 41:01.625
Okay.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.546
Let me go through Harvey's files,
and I'll make a few inquiries,

41:05.629 --> 41:08.716
and, um, I'll see what's available.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.342
Think you can get a letter out of him?

41:10.426 --> 41:11.719
Sure.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.638
Thanks. I owe you one.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.765
More than one.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.560
(kiss on cheek)

41:31.655 --> 41:33.949
(loud clatter)

41:45.794 --> 41:50.424
WOMAN: Well, I don't understand.
Should I put the shading on the left?

41:52.009 --> 41:54.678
-WOMAN: I don't understand.
-See, the shadows, it comes up.

41:55.721 --> 41:59.517
WOMAN: Oh, I see. Like,
if I wanna go with the background,

41:59.600 --> 42:02.520
I should just, um, shade it--

42:02.603 --> 42:05.606
(yelling): Debbie! Freeze it, dog lips!

42:05.689 --> 42:07.399
MAN: What's going on?

42:08.734 --> 42:09.985
Cover yourself.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.405
What are you looking at, fruit ball?

42:13.489 --> 42:14.573
Huh?

42:17.409 --> 42:19.537
Huh? What are you looking at?

42:20.162 --> 42:21.455
What are you looking at?

42:27.670 --> 42:30.589
DEBBIE: The regular model was out,
so I volunteered.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.760
-Just like that?
-Understand something, Mick.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.513
Those students were just
looking at me as a

42:37.596 --> 42:39.765
study in form and composition.

42:39.848 --> 42:41.725
They were stepping on their tongues.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.605
I don't know. It just isn't right.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.274
What would your mother say?

42:48.357 --> 42:50.609
(chuckling): I don't care what she'd say.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.280
I'm a fully grown woman.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.198
I know. I saw.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.327
Did you like me, Michael?

43:00.411 --> 43:03.080
Oh, look, I hardly saw anything.

43:03.163 --> 43:07.376
No, it's all right if you did.
I'm not ashamed of my body.

43:08.252 --> 43:12.047
And I don't want you to be either. Hmm?

43:13.257 --> 43:17.094
I really care about you,
Debbie. I mean really.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.805
I don't want you to do that anymore.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.977
-You mean, pose in the nude?
-Yeah.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.817
I'll make a deal with you.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.030
(laughing)

43:36.113 --> 43:37.990
I won't model anymore

43:38.949 --> 43:42.411
if you take me on a stakeout.

43:42.494 --> 43:43.871
(both laugh)

43:43.954 --> 43:45.414
I can't do that.

43:46.790 --> 43:50.127
Besides, you know,
it's very dangerous out there.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.964
I'm not afraid when I'm with you.

43:54.757 --> 43:58.469
You are so… ferocious

43:58.552 --> 44:00.721
-when you're angry, Mick.
-Oh…

44:03.724 --> 44:06.935
You would get so bored. Really.
It's a lot of hanging around.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.687
It's late at night, in cars and stuff.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.357
-It's boring.
-I don't mind. Really.

44:12.399 --> 44:14.026
Long as I'm with you. (chuckles)

44:14.109 --> 44:17.112
No, I would need authorization, Debbie.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.572
Mm.

44:21.533 --> 44:23.410
I suppose I could ask.

44:26.872 --> 44:30.250
-All right, I'll ask.
-(laughing)

44:40.386 --> 44:44.515
-(indistinct police radio chatter)
-You got a girlfriend, Santini?

44:44.598 --> 44:46.350
Yeah, since high school.

44:47.142 --> 44:48.602
-High school?
-Yeah.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.897
-You gonna get married?
-We talk about it.

44:53.732 --> 44:55.025
You live together?

44:56.193 --> 44:57.319
No.

44:57.945 --> 44:58.946
Why not?

44:59.029 --> 45:01.156
I don't know. We just decided. That's all.

45:01.240 --> 45:05.452
We? Hah. She decided, that's what I think.

45:06.412 --> 45:07.913
She's got you whipped, boy.

45:08.831 --> 45:11.917
I'm gonna have to sit you down
and give you a long, hard lesson

45:12.000 --> 45:14.128
in how to handle female produce.

45:15.170 --> 45:16.463
Hey, what's this up here?

45:19.299 --> 45:22.136
-Let's run the plate.
-Relax, we'll handle it later.

45:23.595 --> 45:25.723
(siren blaring)

45:30.060 --> 45:34.440
All right, ladies, all right.
Hit the pavement nice and easy.

45:34.523 --> 45:38.318
Come on, roll it on out here.
Well, hello. (chuckles)

45:40.154 --> 45:42.281
Holy smokes. Harris, take a look at this.

45:45.951 --> 45:47.786
My, my, my, my, my.

45:47.870 --> 45:51.415
It's a regular bedroom set in there,
mirrors and everything.

45:52.207 --> 45:55.002
All right, ladies, we're gonna have
to take a little ride uptown.

45:55.085 --> 45:56.712
What's the charge, honey?

45:56.795 --> 45:59.173
Hey, why don't I ask the questions, honey?

45:59.882 --> 46:02.301
Let's just assume the position.
Spread them.

46:02.384 --> 46:03.635
Harris, Harris.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.597
Let's just do this by the numbers.
All right?

46:06.680 --> 46:09.641
-Let me just call in to the station.
-You really worry me, you know?

46:09.725 --> 46:11.727
Why don't you just let me handle it, okay?

46:12.394 --> 46:15.647
You first, honey. Lift up your sweater.

46:15.731 --> 46:16.940
I think you must have some

46:17.024 --> 46:19.109
-concealed weapons in there.
-Harris.

46:19.193 --> 46:22.070
I think you better
pull it up for me, Chuck.

46:26.784 --> 46:27.993
(screams, groans)

46:28.076 --> 46:30.829
(suspense music playing)

46:44.384 --> 46:48.263
(dramatic music playing)

47:01.068 --> 47:03.237
-(siren wailing)
-(chattering)

47:03.320 --> 47:06.073
-(coughing)
-MAN: Never a dull moment around here.

47:06.156 --> 47:08.617
-WOMAN: Somebody get killed?
-MAN: Yeah.

47:08.700 --> 47:11.578
-WOMAN 1: Is that a body line?
-WOMAN 2: That's what that chalk is.

47:14.039 --> 47:15.374
WOMAN: Somebody shot a cop?

47:15.457 --> 47:16.750
Jumped him.

47:20.629 --> 47:22.881
(indistinct police radio chatter)

47:25.509 --> 47:27.970
(onlookers murmuring and muttering)

47:36.812 --> 47:39.523
MAN: Okay, that's enough.
Give me that back.

47:40.482 --> 47:44.278
-Give me that back.
-(crowd keep muttering)

47:47.406 --> 47:51.910
(crowd murmuring, scattered laughing)

47:53.370 --> 47:54.705
Where's Santini?

47:55.706 --> 47:56.915
He's over there.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.177
(car door closes)

48:11.179 --> 48:12.514
How'd it happen?

48:15.517 --> 48:17.853
(crying)

48:22.774 --> 48:26.737
(theme music playing)

48:38.206 --> 48:41.293
I'm sorry. (mumbles)

48:41.376 --> 48:44.129
(weeping)

48:50.093 --> 48:52.304
(theme music playing)
