WEBVTT

00:18.436 --> 00:20.347
You care for a game?

00:24.066 --> 00:29.402
Belongs to Crichton, but he's
not on board at the moment.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.940
Do you know how to play?

00:41.834 --> 00:43.290
And this...

00:43.377 --> 00:45.584
Hmm. Porn.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.172
(chuckling)

00:48.758 --> 00:52.342
Crichton:
I figure a relationship
is based on trust.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.920
I didn't want to tell you about
the pregnancy until I was sure.

00:56.015 --> 00:58.301
What's he doing here?
What does he want?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.098
He wants asylum.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.763
Crichton.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.015
You've gotta try these.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.312
Crichton.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.514
What?

01:06.609 --> 01:07.940
You're doing it again.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.062
What?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.017
Zoning.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.239
No, no, lwasjust thinking.

01:12.323 --> 01:14.735
Well, the Aeryn in your
head can wait.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.816
Come on. Come play these
games with me.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.448
Games? Looks like some
kinda sick root.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.869
(chuckling)

01:20.957 --> 01:22.618
lt's organic matrix.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.244
Reality games.

01:24.335 --> 01:25.620
Simulations.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.292
Press the flesh.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.630
Ah.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.555
Sikozu, if you were to open the
door we could play properly.

01:41.978 --> 01:43.309
Chiana?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.099
Pipl

01:51.779 --> 01:53.815
You know you're
completely vulnerable.

01:55.074 --> 01:57.281
Pilot. Moya.
Hey, where are you guys?

01:57.368 --> 01:58.949
I need to get a fix
on your position.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.242
(gasping)

02:00.329 --> 02:01.364
D'Argo:
Crichton.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.036
Yo, D. How you doing, man?

02:03.124 --> 02:03.863
Crichton, where are you?

02:03.958 --> 02:05.198
You have got to see this.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.158
Tell him about Scorpius.
-Not right now, Chiana.

02:07.253 --> 02:08.834
Crichton, we're having a
small problem with Scorpius.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.161
You have got to try this one.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.087
Hang on a sec.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.793
(laughing)

02:17.888 --> 02:19.844
What the hell?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.263
Hey, wait.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.385
Son of a...

02:22.476 --> 02:25.843
Hey, wait for it. Wait for it.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.179
This way!

02:28.274 --> 02:29.889
You have to hurry!

02:31.277 --> 02:32.141
Gilina.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.817
Come on, we gotta hurry!
Come on!

02:33.904 --> 02:34.859
Whoa!

02:34.947 --> 02:37.063
This is just a game, right?

02:37.158 --> 02:39.399
Chiana:
Drad, huh? Bring back memories?

02:39.493 --> 02:42.200
Gilina, Scorpius, Gammak Base.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.363
I'll save you!

02:47.251 --> 02:48.582
Crichton:
Stark?

02:51.130 --> 02:52.165
Now, this is...

02:52.256 --> 02:53.336
This is weird.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.960
Not right.

02:55.051 --> 02:57.042
We shouldn't just...
we shouldn't just switch
levels like that.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.548
Crichton:
No, no, no, I mean somebody's
messing with us.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.253
Well, I'm sure there's some
really good techno-babble...

03:01.349 --> 03:03.510
You know what?
Screw the explanation, Chiana.

03:03.601 --> 03:07.890
We got a problem with Scorpy
on Moya and Pods do not
fly themselves.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.140
We need out.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.222
Princess:
Help!

03:11.817 --> 03:13.273
Help!

03:15.321 --> 03:16.936
Help.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.070
Cool.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.901
Now I know somebody's
messing with us.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.782
We gotta end this now.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.238
Just say you want out.

03:27.333 --> 03:28.664
I want out.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.117
Yep.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.204
That's standard override.
Try again.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.914
I want... out.

03:38.302 --> 03:42.261
I... want... out!

03:56.278 --> 04:00.191
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.774
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.655
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:05.746 --> 04:08.909
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

04:08.999 --> 04:10.739
my friends.

04:11.836 --> 04:13.622
I've made enemies.

04:13.712 --> 04:17.000
Powerful, dangerous.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.583
Now all I want is to
find a way home

04:20.678 --> 04:22.464
to warn Earth.

04:23.556 --> 04:28.596
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.957
( birds twittering )

05:01.051 --> 05:02.882
Hey.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.211
Ouch.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.262
Hey, you okay?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.930
(coughing)

05:09.018 --> 05:10.303
Anyone home?

05:10.394 --> 05:12.476
What happened?

05:12.563 --> 05:14.144
I'm not sure.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.313
Something's gone fekkik up.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.264
Damn, that hurt.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.020
But I wouldn't...

05:19.111 --> 05:20.772
lwouldn't try and move that.

05:20.863 --> 05:23.320
Yeah. Might make things worse.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.440
Oh, my God.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.944
How...

05:27.745 --> 05:28.780
Stark.

05:28.871 --> 05:29.621
Stark?

05:29.705 --> 05:30.694
You're here?

05:30.789 --> 05:32.165
I'm supposed to be here.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.329
I am everywhere.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.328
I am Stark. Avatar.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.284
Guide. The game embodied.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.710
You're the Avatar?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.253
What are you doing here?

05:40.341 --> 05:43.083
All players are supposed to
begin at the Gammak base.

05:43.761 --> 05:44.796
Pip?

05:44.887 --> 05:46.297
What do you want me to do?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.128
The auto-out didn't work.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.304
Oh, dear.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.255
Oh, dear?

05:50.351 --> 05:51.682
Oh, dear?

05:59.777 --> 06:03.440
Stark:
You say you were on a
Transport Pod, alone?

06:03.531 --> 06:04.611
Mmm.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.029
Just you two?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.401
That's not very smart.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.449
Right. 80 we'd like out
now, please.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.152
I'm afraid it's not that easy.

06:11.247 --> 06:12.327
Could be broken.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.201
Okay, Stark. Some questions.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.372
Who's the designer of the game?

06:16.460 --> 06:18.200
Yoti.
-Neural Template?

06:18.295 --> 06:22.163
Yours truly, and an infusion of
the dead John Crichton's
memories.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.998
Excuse me, you stole
my memories?

06:24.093 --> 06:26.800
Yeah. You appear to have
backdoored into a part
of the game

06:26.887 --> 06:29.469
that technically speaking,
shouldn't even exist.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.344
So, you're kind of stuck,
I think.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.470
Chiana. Scorpius.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.143
Oh, stop being such a welnitz.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.640
Brain damage and death is...

06:37.731 --> 06:39.642
Brain damage?!
-|t's very rare.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.315
It's very rare.
-Wel-wel-welcome.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.644
My name is John
Crichton-Crichton,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.990
the most notorious criminal
in the known universe.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.611
Stark:
Aghh! Too general.
I need the manual.

06:49.702 --> 06:53.069
I may look Sebacean,
but I'm not-not-not.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.246
Billions upon b-b-billions
upon billions of lives

06:56.333 --> 06:58.790
hang in the b-b-balance
hang in the b-b-balance

06:58.877 --> 07:01.584
I may look Sebeacean...
hang in the b-b-balance.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.288
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it...

07:04.383 --> 07:06.840
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it...

07:06.927 --> 07:09.543
Journey to the source
of evil-evil.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.094
Discover the darkness.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.172
I'm gonna kill Stark.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.882
Discover the darkness.

07:14.977 --> 07:18.344
Erp, erp, have a good day.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.812
Ha.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.275
Manual.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.607
Ah, specifications,
specifications.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.984
Ah. Here we are.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.238
ln farthest space, beyond the
knowing charts, the horrid
human and his band appear.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.571
And though they play today at
different parts, the core of
subtle truth beneath is clear.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.123
The path of choice may draw you
dark and deep, where flesh
deformed doth keep the dream alive.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.953
And if the way your compass
cannot keep, some pearls of
wisdom to thee do I give.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.334
Ha! This should do it.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.292
Your quest is for the princess
fair to seek.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.799
The one a human's fleeting
love did rend.

07:52.890 --> 07:56.348
Bring forth the sword and
through the darkness peek,

07:56.435 --> 07:59.848
One loving kiss amends and
there's an end,

07:59.938 --> 08:07.606
and if we shades with taste do
not agree, a door of green
shall set your senses free.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.735
That was great.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.657
Your way out.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.235
Kiss the princess.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.160
Kiss a princess?

08:17.247 --> 08:18.703
The princess, and you're out.

08:18.791 --> 08:20.827
Or find a green door.
Either way.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.374
Vouchers.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.168
Each one good for one answer
to one question.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.871
Squeeze them hard.
Use them well.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.378
Time's up. Game's on.
Good luck. Have fun.

08:30.469 --> 08:33.176
The tower's up, but up is down.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.881
Follow the path through
the fairy town.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.271
l have some questions.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.518
Path?

08:46.235 --> 08:48.191
Up is down.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.233
Start looking.

08:50.489 --> 08:53.196
Kiss the princess.
You gotta like that.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.569
l have a list of reasons why I
ain't gonna like any of this.

08:55.661 --> 08:59.279
Would you call that a path?

09:00.290 --> 09:02.906
These things look like
chocolate coins.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.629
( both grunting and gasping )

09:12.720 --> 09:14.301
Frell me!

09:14.388 --> 09:17.050
(laughing)

09:18.267 --> 09:20.349
That's a path.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.347
Hey, what happens if
I die in here?

09:22.438 --> 09:25.145
Uh, game death resets on
the current level.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.190
Yeah, unless normal operation
is suspended.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.689
You see a green door?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.612
What do you suppose
is in there?

09:33.699 --> 09:35.439
With our luck?

09:35.534 --> 09:36.865
Maldis.

09:52.468 --> 09:54.299
Hey there.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.092
Oh.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.636
Relax, together.

09:57.723 --> 10:02.217
I am Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan,
tenth level Delvian priest,

10:02.311 --> 10:05.474
blood kin to the piezor
who bit Scorpy's ass.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.271
And you, and you,

10:08.358 --> 10:12.192
you're invading my parking
space. Now, frell off.
-Hey, wait, wh-where...

10:12.279 --> 10:16.147
I know who you are. You're a
couple of pilgrims on
some damn fool quest.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.981
Hey, he's hurt.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.282
He's hurt?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.984
Yeah.

10:22.998 --> 10:27.116
Well, he's gonna be more hurt
if he tries to kiss
the princess.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.826
The Ogre'll get him.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.081
O-Ogre?

10:30.672 --> 10:31.252
Ah!

10:31.340 --> 10:32.750
(grunting)

10:33.717 --> 10:35.423
(chuckling)

10:37.221 --> 10:38.836
Be still.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.343
It's gonna hurt. A lot.

10:42.100 --> 10:45.433
(yelling)

10:50.317 --> 10:51.397
Chiana:
He doesn't look so good.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.975
Yup, he's bad.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.230
He's going south.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.313
Oh!

10:57.407 --> 10:58.863
lt's milkin' time, baby.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.942
Hamman side looma for the cure.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.242
Oh!

11:02.329 --> 11:03.694
Thank you.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.576
Yeah. Better get ready
to keep him quiet.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.953
The Ogre is not gonna let you
kiss her, you know.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.250
He'll be jealous.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.452
Feed him, you fannik.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.333
Okay. Here's the good stuff.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.129
Here it is. Oh...

11:15.217 --> 11:16.377
Frell!

11:16.468 --> 11:18.379
Acid.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.262
Okay, try the other looma.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.465
Very good, little nixar.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.175
Most get burnt the first time.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.010
Okay, here we go.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.766
Other looma.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.313
Next time lucky.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.062
Unless the Ogre gets wind of
this, then there'll be trouble.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.734
Okay, here's my boy.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.359
Keep it down. Keep it down.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.155
Oh... Oh...

11:42.077 --> 11:46.116
(yelling)

11:46.206 --> 11:48.743
(Chiana and Big Zhaan yelling)

11:49.960 --> 11:51.245
This is bad!

11:51.336 --> 11:52.837
(Ogre growls)
Ooh, he had to hear that!

11:52.921 --> 11:55.458
Ogre:
Fe fi fo fum!
-Buckle up, buckle up!

11:55.549 --> 11:56.959
(engine starting)

11:57.050 --> 11:58.130
Who had to hear?!

11:58.218 --> 11:59.378
The Big Kahuna!

11:59.469 --> 12:01.630
It's the Ogre! lt's him!

12:01.722 --> 12:04.338
(tires screeching )

12:13.817 --> 12:15.432
Get him out! Get him out!

12:15.527 --> 12:18.610
(tires screeching )

12:21.283 --> 12:23.365
(mumbling):
ldon't wanna go...

12:23.452 --> 12:24.567
Zhaan.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.821
Yeah.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.369
Oh, the horror.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.196
The new and improved Zhaan.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.373
How ya feelin ?

12:32.711 --> 12:34.747
Fruity.
( laughter)

12:34.838 --> 12:36.169
If you say so.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.123
You have to, Crichton.
Or these games will eat you up.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.503
All right, I'll try.
-Just give it a go.
Give it a go.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.881
Look, I said I'll...

12:43.972 --> 12:45.212
Whoa.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.922
None shall pass.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.348
(royal theme plays)

12:48.435 --> 12:51.347
( laughs )
Check this out.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.723
Brave sir knight!

12:52.814 --> 12:55.351
I am King Arthur of Camelot.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.478
This is my loyal vassal, Patsy.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.649
Bollocks!

12:58.737 --> 13:01.319
You're a pimped-out,
arrogant fleshie

13:01.406 --> 13:06.491
who wants to use my road
where none shall pass.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.151
Right.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.033
Well, that went great.
Let's kill him.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.501
No, no, he's not gonna move too
fast, lugging all that armor.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.166
We can just go around.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.380
None... shall... pass!

13:17.464 --> 13:19.000
Okay.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.206
(grunts)

13:21.218 --> 13:22.799
( screams )

13:22.886 --> 13:24.877
Whoa!

13:24.972 --> 13:26.508
Whoa! I thought you
said this way!

13:26.598 --> 13:28.008
I changed my mind!

13:28.100 --> 13:29.260
Huh?

13:29.351 --> 13:30.181
Huh?

13:30.268 --> 13:31.348
(grunts)

13:31.436 --> 13:33.097
( screams )

13:33.188 --> 13:35.224
( yells battlecry )

13:37.067 --> 13:38.432
( screams )

13:43.240 --> 13:44.320
Whoa.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.648
( laughter)

13:45.742 --> 13:47.824
Hey, Pip.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.368
You see a path?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.416
No. No, I don't.

14:00.215 --> 14:04.629
Crichton:
I said to wait but no, you
wanna play games while Scorpy is on the ship!

14:04.720 --> 14:08.087
Not to mention the potential
brain damage, Chiana!

14:09.057 --> 14:10.263
A green door.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.432
We need a green door.
Just... just ask.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.599
Voucher.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.976
Voucher. One question,
one answer.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.774
Warm tonight, or is itjust me?
-Stark, we want out.

14:23.864 --> 14:27.823
The tower's up but up is down.
Follow the path through
the fairy town. Later!

14:27.909 --> 14:32.949
Stark, you get your ass back
here now or I'm gonna come
kick your lily white...

14:34.416 --> 14:35.371
Chiana:
That's it.

14:35.459 --> 14:36.915
( rattling )

14:37.002 --> 14:38.162
What are you doin'?

14:38.253 --> 14:41.370
Follow the path.
The path ends here.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.375
( both screaming )

14:43.467 --> 14:44.832
(gasps )

14:47.387 --> 14:48.297
Hey...

14:48.388 --> 14:50.970
Okay, what are you doing here?

14:51.058 --> 14:54.266
Hansel:
Hey, Gretel. You think
they're here to eat?

14:54.352 --> 14:56.013
Uh, we're just passing through?

14:56.104 --> 14:57.765
The Princess.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.221
Please!

14:59.316 --> 15:00.977
(gasping)

15:01.068 --> 15:06.358
The Ogre's gonna have my hide
if I let you go without some
molestation.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.689
Gretel:
Frell you, Hansel!
Why is it never my turn?

15:08.784 --> 15:09.864
(laughing)

15:09.951 --> 15:11.407
(evil laugh)
(hissing)

15:11.495 --> 15:14.202
Hey look, we... we... we don t
wanna kiss the princess.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.031
We just want that...
that green door there.
-Please, eat me!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.331
( laughing )
It's my turn!

15:18.418 --> 15:20.329
Eat me! Please, kill me!
It's my turn!

15:20.420 --> 15:24.459
(screaming):
Shut up!

15:26.802 --> 15:28.508
(sighs)

15:28.595 --> 15:31.632
Okay. So you want out?

15:31.723 --> 15:35.261
No princess, no tastes,
no, uh...

15:35.352 --> 15:37.263
(evil giggling)

15:37.354 --> 15:39.470
Now, this is too easy.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.350
She tastes great.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.432
Ah, she tastes real great.
-Please, eat me. Yummy, yummy.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.733
Go on.

15:44.820 --> 15:46.651
Gretel:
Yummy, yummy.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.148
Don't go. Eat me.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.572
That's it! That's it.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.615
Go to the door.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.691
(hissing)

15:53.787 --> 15:55.118
(thud)

15:57.332 --> 15:58.447
Damn!

15:58.542 --> 16:00.157
Way too long in that thing.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.867
Pip, come on.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.918
Pilot?

16:04.005 --> 16:05.165
Aeryn? D'Argo?

16:05.257 --> 16:06.463
Crichton, where the
frell are you?

16:06.550 --> 16:08.211
Oh, just trying to get
home, Auntie Em.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.552
Hey, you guys got a problem?

16:09.636 --> 16:10.751
Scorpius.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.461
Just do not tell me that
he has escaped.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.671
He has.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.721
And there's a Command Carrier
on the way.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.427
(engines roar)

16:20.522 --> 16:22.183
Crichton:
D'Argo, how the hell
did that happen?!

16:22.274 --> 16:25.516
Still working on that. We've got
lots of bugs in Moya's systems.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.521
Oh, great. Well, what does
Sikozu say about that?

16:27.612 --> 16:29.227
Haven't heard from her
since the escape.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.608
But Pilot's losing control
of critical systems.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.534
Right, right, right.
We will be there ASAP.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.281
Chiana, dammit, wake up!

16:38.165 --> 16:39.450
All right.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.578
All right, how the hell does
this thing come off?

16:52.179 --> 16:54.261
Where's Chiana?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.633
Ah, she's too bony.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.681
Probably tastes like fish.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.224
You don't wanna eat her.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.177
The bloody bitch bites.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.933
What am |, chopped liver?!

17:04.024 --> 17:05.810
I do not have time for this.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.608
Gretel:
How come nobody ever
wants to eat me?!

17:10.405 --> 17:11.315
Stark:
ln here!

17:11.406 --> 17:12.156
Where?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.855
ln here!

17:15.785 --> 17:18.948
Back so soon? And I thought
you didn't like us.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.199
Where's Chiana?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.702
Could you be more specific?

17:22.792 --> 17:26.330
Little grey girl.
A sword and a floppy hat.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.161
Girl of grey with
swords at play.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.042
Girl of grey went that a way.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.129
(ding)

17:34.221 --> 17:35.552
Wait for it!

17:35.639 --> 17:37.630
Mind the gap.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.474
(elevator music plays)

17:51.446 --> 17:52.276
Eenie, meenie...

17:52.364 --> 17:54.605
Floor, please.
-...me.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.690
Where the grey girl went.

17:56.785 --> 18:01.324
Oh-oh-oh-oh... the penthouse.
Mmm.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.367
Do you have an appointment?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.995
You know, this would be vaguely
amusing if I wasn't in a hurry.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.794
Pleasure?

18:12.884 --> 18:15.216
Hmm... That's a nice sword
you've got.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.009
Ever slay any dragons with it?

18:17.097 --> 18:22.763
You should give it a name.
How about Cameron or
Uma-Uma-Uma?

18:23.853 --> 18:26.344
First floor-first floor,
little lost girls.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.895
Have a good day.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.772
(elevator dings)

18:29.859 --> 18:31.520
(growling)

18:31.611 --> 18:32.851
Whoa!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.823
Yes, I know.
This elevator sucks.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.323
My job su-su-su-sucks.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.156
Day after day,
the same-same thing.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.208
Up. Down. Up. Down. Down.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.412
Just once-just once, it'd be
nice to go sideways.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.919
Just-just sideways.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.125
Frog Princes!

18:56.219 --> 18:58.084
( growls )

19:00.015 --> 19:02.552
Not-not that I plan on doing
this forever-ever.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.258
l have plans, you know.
Big plans.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.390
l-l'm studying to be
an astronaut.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.062
And, penthouse.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.390
Have a good day.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.229
I knew it.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.280
I knew it had to be you!

19:19.367 --> 19:20.982
Ma'am!

19:23.371 --> 19:25.077
A visitor.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.656
( lisping Southern accent):
Yes, I can see that.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.161
I'm so sorry, Ma'am.

19:29.252 --> 19:31.413
I didn't realize you were
expecting other guests.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.085
That's all right, Harvey.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.960
Would you let the master know
that we have a gentleman caller?

19:38.178 --> 19:39.759
He's not the Ogre?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.052
What, Harvey?

19:41.139 --> 19:44.381
Oh heavens no.
He's just an incorrigible liar.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.387
And the butler.

19:46.478 --> 19:50.437
So, can I help you find
someplace to sheathe that sword?

19:52.901 --> 19:54.266
No, where's, uh...

19:54.361 --> 19:55.817
The grey girl?

19:55.904 --> 19:58.236
Don't you worry about her.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.111
My beast of a boyfriend is
showing her around the place.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.533
Can I get you a drink?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.326
No.
-Oh, don't be like that.

20:05.413 --> 20:08.450
You must be parched from
coming all this way.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.327
| only want Chiana.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.875
Oh now,

20:12.962 --> 20:16.500
we both know that's not true.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.295
Honey!

20:20.387 --> 20:22.753
We're out of ice.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.257
Steady on there, meat.

20:24.349 --> 20:28.843
We just finished redecorating
the last bloodbath we
had in here.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.393
( laughs )

20:30.480 --> 20:32.846
It's a little joke.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.602
(nervous laugh)
So.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.684
You here to kiss the missus?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.895
Why do you have to be
such a monster?

20:39.989 --> 20:42.116
At least I don't spend
my days redecorating.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.942
What is it with women
and change?!

20:45.036 --> 20:47.823
Seems like nothing is
ever good enough.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.498
Oh! You have to save me
from him! Please!
You have to save me! -Chiana!

20:51.584 --> 20:53.870
Hey!
-What the hell have
you been doing?

20:53.962 --> 20:56.795
We have a problem on the ship.
We have to go!
-Okay.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.497
See? Every time we meet someone
nice, you scare them away.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.298
Something wrong?
-You scare them away!

21:01.386 --> 21:04.298
Of course, as usual.
Now let's go!

21:04.389 --> 21:05.629
( both gasping )

21:07.392 --> 21:08.973
Frell.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.428
D! Rally the troops,
we're coming in.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.320
What took you so long?

21:23.408 --> 21:24.898
Weird detour.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.325
Pilot's blind on the hamman
side, Tiers Seven and Eleven.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.822
DRD's are searching there.

21:28.913 --> 21:31.290
It's likely Scorpius is hiding
in those blind spots.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.241
The plan is, we hunt him down.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.199
Like that plan.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.126
Aeryn and John you take
Tier Seven.
-Okay.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.421
And Rygel, stay where you are
and stay out of trouble.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.557
This is familiar.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.858
What, the passageway?

22:01.738 --> 22:03.694
No.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.824
It's good to have you back.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.533
( sniffs )

22:17.629 --> 22:20.416
( screaming )

22:23.259 --> 22:25.215
Crichton. Aeryn. He's here!

22:25.303 --> 22:27.214
On our way, Pilot.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.296
Seal the chamber.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.254
( beeps )

22:32.644 --> 22:34.635
Locked out.

22:34.729 --> 22:36.139
D'Argo!

22:36.231 --> 22:37.186
Aeryn:
Pilot?

22:37.273 --> 22:38.353
Pip?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.306
Crichton, I can't find D'Argo.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.312
Access shaft, this way.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.824
Feels like a trap.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.323
Only one way to know.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.450
Pilot?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.335
You all right?

23:09.639 --> 23:11.300
( both gasping )

23:11.391 --> 23:14.258
Everything is finally
under control.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.307
Pilot?

23:15.395 --> 23:17.602
Not exactly, Commander.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.897
Have you ever heard of
a neural harness?

23:20.984 --> 23:25.398
Scorpius:
Your Pilot's mind is now
slave to my own.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.321
John.
-Whatever happens to
the master...

23:28.408 --> 23:30.273
happens to the slave.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.575
If I die,

23:32.662 --> 23:34.243
so does your Pilot.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.072
Grayza's Command Carrier
is on the way.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.417
He's a pathological liar.

23:38.501 --> 23:41.163
Our odds are not going
to get any better.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.290
FeeHnglucky?

23:44.299 --> 23:45.584
(gasps )

23:48.803 --> 23:49.667
( groans )

23:49.762 --> 23:51.172
Aeryn?

24:05.737 --> 24:06.772
( Crichton groans )

24:06.863 --> 24:08.478
He's awake.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.861
He did it, didn't he?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.862
Tagged you with a microchip?

24:13.953 --> 24:17.320
You haven't considered the
possibility that l was
protecting Pilot.

24:17.415 --> 24:20.373
The second boot to the head
convinced me otherwise.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.926
She's special, don't you think?

24:38.519 --> 24:40.430
You son of a bitch.

24:46.069 --> 24:47.934
Shall we end this?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.241
You resisted the Aurora Chair.

24:59.332 --> 25:06.204
You've resisted my neural clone
and, uh, you resist all reason.

25:08.299 --> 25:11.041
You're starting to
sound like Sikozu.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.966
Perhaps.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.464
Where does that leave us, John?

25:14.555 --> 25:18.389
Time you headed off for darker
pastures and left me
the hell alone.

25:18.476 --> 25:21.718
You resist because
you have hope.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.555
Hope that your friends
will save you.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.106
This time it will be different.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.650
One by one, I will extinguish
all your hopes

25:29.737 --> 25:32.479
and little by little you will
begin to see reason.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.313
Aeryn:
Scorpius.

25:34.409 --> 25:35.865
We have Rygel.

25:35.952 --> 25:38.318
Lovely girl.

25:38.413 --> 25:43.077
I hear that one quarter
Scarran-Sebacean offspring
are quite handsome.

25:53.094 --> 25:57.508
You harm me, you harm her.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.238
Chiana:
Psst. Hey.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.160
Crichton.

26:23.416 --> 26:24.872
Down here.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.828
I've got the game.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.208
( chuckles )

26:36.262 --> 26:37.251
Crichton:
Chiana!

26:37.346 --> 26:38.927
Shh. They're sleeping.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.846
Okay. I don't wanna have
to deal with them now.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.801
Okay, Scorpius has got control
over the whole of the ship.

26:44.896 --> 26:48.184
He's got D'Argo and Rygel,
everybody.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.357
He can hear everything.
Not in here.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.732
Right. We can't kill the son
of a bitch without hurting
the others.

26:54.822 --> 26:58.280
Whatever happens to him happens
to everybody he controls.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.232
So leave me the game
blob thingy.

27:00.328 --> 27:04.116
When I take him down, you
have to find a way to
hog tie everybody.

27:04.207 --> 27:06.994
So you're gonna draw Scorpius
into the game?

27:20.389 --> 27:21.845
(grunting)

27:39.617 --> 27:42.575
Aeryn:
What are you doing?

27:42.662 --> 27:45.199
Working on what your
master wants.

27:48.084 --> 27:50.245
So you still think that
he controls me.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.793
Does he?

27:55.216 --> 28:00.882
Look, the only thing that
keeps you alive is the
secret you hold.

28:00.972 --> 28:03.338
And the same is true for me.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.598
He's hearing all this,
you know.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.270
I know.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.813
I should never have let you go.

28:27.290 --> 28:31.408
Most of this floor you
should recognize.

28:31.502 --> 28:35.586
It's an equation describing the
behavior of wormholes.

28:35.673 --> 28:41.009
What it lacks is the single
unifying symbol.

28:41.095 --> 28:44.838
That symbol is beneath
my left foot.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.387
Would you like to see it?

28:50.313 --> 28:52.144
You would give it to me?

28:52.231 --> 28:54.222
I want you to take it.

28:58.613 --> 29:03.198
Your species has brutal flair.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.366
Anyone else enters this room,

29:05.453 --> 29:09.037
I can spill enough blood to
erase the entire equation.

29:09.123 --> 29:10.579
Very well.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.458
You know if you kill me...

29:14.545 --> 29:19.915
Oh, I don't think that's
going happen, not after
all you've survived.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.759
Then again, I could get lucky.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.597
(grunting)

29:31.354 --> 29:32.890
Oh, crap. I wasn't...

29:32.980 --> 29:35.437
Gilina:
Quick, this way.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.649
He's not supposed to come
from that direction.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.451
Really, John? You expect to
hold me in a simulation?

29:52.249 --> 29:55.082
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

29:55.169 --> 29:57.956
This world means nothing to me.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.129
I see through it's
very existence.

30:00.216 --> 30:03.333
John! Please!
-Allow me to show you
what I see.

30:04.011 --> 30:06.297
( screaming )

30:11.811 --> 30:13.847
Scorpius:
Having trouble breathing?

30:15.022 --> 30:17.604
I wonder if you die now,

30:17.692 --> 30:22.561
whether your mind will carry
the wormhole knowledge with it,
into the game.

30:26.242 --> 30:27.652
Relax, John.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.234
Soon it'll be over.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.164
He was killing you.
I couldn't let that happen.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.287
We have to get out of here
before he comes out.

30:37.378 --> 30:38.709
Come on.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.375
What about the others?

30:42.466 --> 30:44.047
We can't save the others.
Listen.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.251
John, I came back for you.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.301
Nothing else matters, ljust...

30:48.389 --> 30:50.550
want to be with you.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.814
Now let's get out of here
before it's too late.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.646
Something's wrong.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.901
Something's wrong.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.460
Does this mean it's over?

31:33.392 --> 31:34.472
Chiana!

31:34.560 --> 31:36.642
What's wrong?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.560
Everything.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.316
We're still in the game.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.355
No.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.979
We never left.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.233
Moya is part of the game.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.200
(thud)

32:04.965 --> 32:06.671
They changed the doors.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.091
Stark:
Figured it out, have we?

32:09.178 --> 32:10.338
Stark!

32:10.429 --> 32:12.294
What the hell is this about?

32:12.389 --> 32:17.179
This is all about you,
John Crichton.

32:17.269 --> 32:22.013
Stark's voice:
You're far too sick to be
allowed to run free in the universe.

32:23.442 --> 32:27.230
When you die on the outside,
your mind will live on.

32:27.321 --> 32:29.607
Here, with us.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.571
Welcome home, John.

32:47.091 --> 32:50.333
How the hell do we get
out of this game?
-I don't know.

32:50.427 --> 32:53.464
Then this better work.
-Okay.

32:53.556 --> 32:54.636
(bell chimes)

32:54.723 --> 32:57.635
Stark:
Careful. It's your last one.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.011
What the hell's the endgame?

32:59.103 --> 33:00.843
One hero's sword to set
her free-free-free,

33:00.938 --> 33:03.224
one kiss upon her lips
so sweet,

33:03.315 --> 33:06.148
thus ends your quest,
thus ends the game-game,

33:06.235 --> 33:08.146
and thus your soul is saved.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.774
Oh, we already heard that.
-Yeah, I know that.

33:10.865 --> 33:12.856
But finding a door out
may be impossible.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.316
If we die, it only
resets a level.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.902
One sure way out,
we achieve the endgame.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.237
We're gonna kiss the princess.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.617
Run, run, run, as fast as you
can. Float like a budong.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.745
Not in the face!

33:23.836 --> 33:26.669
Bastard wants us to play,
let's give him what he wants.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.762
Stark's voice:
That hurt, John.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.968
Stark. Ha.

33:43.814 --> 33:46.476
So how'd you do it? Who helped?

33:48.819 --> 33:50.480
You did.

33:50.571 --> 33:53.483
You and that tragic brother,

33:53.574 --> 33:56.065
pouring his heart out
on his death bed.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.616
Bull.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.069
This game has crap he
couldn't know.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.655
It's crap you gave me
along the way.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.366
You talk so much.

34:07.338 --> 34:11.331
Oh, God, no Sikozu, no Noranti.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.006
( chuckles )

34:13.093 --> 34:15.300
Very good.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.800
Damn, I guess that leaves
one question.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.767
Plants.

34:20.851 --> 34:22.557
Why do they love the light?

34:22.645 --> 34:24.852
(horn honking)

34:27.233 --> 34:29.224
Oh... John.

34:29.318 --> 34:30.728
Oh!

34:34.698 --> 34:35.562
Ha.

34:35.658 --> 34:38.616
Stark's voice:
None shall pass.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.660
(gasps )

34:45.751 --> 34:47.332
( screams )

34:48.212 --> 34:50.043
( laughing )

34:51.173 --> 34:53.255
( laughing )

34:57.596 --> 34:58.631
( laughing )

34:58.722 --> 35:00.713
What are they doing here?

35:00.808 --> 35:03.140
It's my turn!
(mumbles loudly)

35:03.227 --> 35:07.095
You are disturbing my meal.

35:07.189 --> 35:08.429
Chiana?
-Yeah?

35:08.524 --> 35:10.355
Does this room seem too easy?

35:11.402 --> 35:13.643
( mumbles )
-What do you mean?

35:13.737 --> 35:17.229
I mean, first time here.
How did you make it through?

35:20.286 --> 35:21.696
Uh...

35:21.787 --> 35:24.244
Crichton:
Chiana, what's Aeryn's secret?

35:24.331 --> 35:25.286
What?

35:26.292 --> 35:27.782
(mumbles)

35:27.876 --> 35:29.412
Aeryn's secret.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.211
(mumbling)

35:34.174 --> 35:36.335
( screaming )

35:36.427 --> 35:37.587
(grunts)

35:37.678 --> 35:39.134
What about me?!

35:39.221 --> 35:40.552
(grunts)

35:41.348 --> 35:42.337
(mumbling)

35:43.934 --> 35:45.049
(grunting)

35:49.606 --> 35:50.516
’23:???)
saé,’é)’~2
>,,;,s;;,;

35:50.607 --> 35:51.642
Eat this.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.065
(grunting)

35:53.610 --> 35:54.565
( laughing )

35:54.653 --> 35:55.768
(birds chirping)

35:55.863 --> 35:57.569
Chiana:
Aeryn's pregnant.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.399
Frell, Crichton! You left me
there for arns! I could've died.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.074
Sorry about that.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.278
(elevator droning quietly)

36:07.249 --> 36:10.036
John Headroom:
What is it with women
and change?

36:10.127 --> 36:13.290
You-You-You really are
John Crichton.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.462
Can I get an autograph?

36:15.549 --> 36:17.335
(sword clangs/bell dings)

36:17.426 --> 36:19.508
(circuitry zapping )

36:21.305 --> 36:23.796
Master.
( imitates trumpet )

36:23.891 --> 36:24.846
We have guests.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.343
I'm here for the princess.

36:26.435 --> 36:30.644
( lisping Southern accent):
I can see that. So romantic.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.222
You up for this? Could be fun.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.603
Chiana:
Let's screw the pooch.

36:36.945 --> 36:38.731
I'm all about fun.

36:39.365 --> 36:40.104
Hurrah.

36:41.283 --> 36:44.195
( laughing )

36:45.788 --> 36:47.073
Game on.

36:47.790 --> 36:49.075
I learned this on TV.

36:49.166 --> 36:49.825
(swords clang )

36:49.917 --> 36:51.407
I'm not gonna clean up.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.537
Princess:
Ooh! Come on, Harvey.
Stop fightin' like a girl!

36:56.632 --> 36:58.293
(grunting)

37:01.303 --> 37:03.840
You need more practice, meat!

37:03.931 --> 37:04.795
I'll make a note.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.800
( laughing )

37:05.891 --> 37:07.427
(grunting)

37:07.518 --> 37:10.260
Oh, good. I can see who wears
the pants in your family.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.436
(grunting/swords clanging )

37:14.108 --> 37:16.269
Redecoratin'. Blood everywhere!

37:16.360 --> 37:18.066
(gasping)

37:19.780 --> 37:20.610
( laughs )

37:20.697 --> 37:21.652
She just killed you.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.355
Honey, the butler's dead.

37:23.450 --> 37:25.190
(grunting)

37:25.911 --> 37:26.661
(panting)

37:26.745 --> 37:28.201
Hey, Pip...
-Yeah?

37:28.288 --> 37:29.368
Little help!
-Fre|l.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.617
(grunting)

37:31.708 --> 37:33.573
That's it, finish him off.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.124
Two against one!

37:38.215 --> 37:40.797
Looks like I won't be having
that drink, after all!

37:40.884 --> 37:41.794
(yelling)

37:41.885 --> 37:43.341
Chiana:
He's mine.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.919
(grunting)

37:45.013 --> 37:46.048
How am I doin'?

37:46.140 --> 37:47.255
( blows a kiss )
Coming back for you.

37:47.349 --> 37:49.055
I hope so.

38:01.363 --> 38:02.944
( cries out painfully)

38:04.199 --> 38:05.814
Oh, child!

38:05.909 --> 38:07.615
(yells)

38:08.370 --> 38:09.610
( groans )

38:09.705 --> 38:11.286
Princess:
Well, she's done it now.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.122
Women!

38:19.423 --> 38:20.629
( slashes )

38:20.716 --> 38:22.172
(gasps )

38:31.477 --> 38:33.263
Chiana:
Go on.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.312
Are you really John Crichton?

38:37.399 --> 38:38.229
Yeah.

38:38.317 --> 38:41.400
We are gonna be so
happy together.

38:46.533 --> 38:48.239
(sighs blissfully)

38:55.334 --> 38:56.665
(sighs)

39:09.306 --> 39:11.297
Chiana?

39:11.683 --> 39:13.298
Uh...

39:13.393 --> 39:14.178
I don't know.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.304
What do you mean,
you don't know?

39:15.395 --> 39:16.180
I don't know.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.772
Stark:
Hey, I know.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.848
Maybe you have to do more
than just kiss her.

39:20.943 --> 39:25.186
Maybe "kiss" is a metaphor for
showing her a really good time.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.486
Mmm.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.815
Yeah, and maybe Chiana
has to kiss her. Huh?

39:29.910 --> 39:32.071
Can I watch? I love to watch.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.198
She is not the princess.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.745
What?

39:35.832 --> 39:37.242
Oh.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.040
Well, I'm not the princess
you seek,

39:39.127 --> 39:41.994
but we could still have
a really good time.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.132
This is my world, meat!

39:47.219 --> 39:50.928
You're just walking through it
for a very long time.

39:51.014 --> 39:58.762
When your body is dead, your
mind will live here, with us,
to strut and fret forever.

39:58.855 --> 40:01.813
You poor player.

40:04.611 --> 40:05.441
(sword falls)

40:05.529 --> 40:07.269
Chiana:
Crichton?

40:23.964 --> 40:26.330
Game reset.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.336
What are you doing, John
do-do-doing, John?

40:28.427 --> 40:30.418
Your world, your princess.

40:30.512 --> 40:33.345
( reverberating ):
Princess, princess,
pr-princess.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.299
One-One pr-princess fair,
her bro-broken heart

40:36.393 --> 40:39.635
by ug-ugliness enslaved,
ug-ugliness-ugliness enslaved.

40:39.730 --> 40:41.846
Ugliness enslaved.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.268
John, we can work this out.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.269
(Zhaan chanting )

40:45.360 --> 40:47.146
(grunting)

40:47.237 --> 40:49.899
(whimpering)

40:49.990 --> 40:53.278
One hero's sword to
set her free.

41:06.256 --> 41:09.293
Stark:
Don't touch her!
She's mine! Mine!

41:09.384 --> 41:11.670
Be silent, Stark.

41:16.725 --> 41:19.216
Is that really you,
John Crichton?

41:20.646 --> 41:22.853
I think, yeah.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.776
And you're...

41:26.860 --> 41:29.476
Zhaan.

41:29.571 --> 41:31.607
For all that matters.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.195
This Stark wishes to
keep you here.

41:36.286 --> 41:37.571
He blames you.

41:37.663 --> 41:38.778
No.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.284
Believes I died for the
love of you.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.209
A lot of people have died
because of me.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.672
What is it that you wish of me,
John Crichton?

41:53.303 --> 41:55.965
A kiss.

41:56.056 --> 42:00.720
Have you wasted my death, and
the deaths of so many others?

42:03.563 --> 42:05.303
I don't know.

42:05.399 --> 42:08.687
Then I suggest you find out,

42:08.777 --> 42:11.393
before anyone else dies
for the love of you.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.024
No.

42:19.454 --> 42:20.830
(grunting)

42:20.914 --> 42:22.415
(sighing)

42:22.499 --> 42:24.080
Son of a bitch!

42:24.167 --> 42:25.543
D! D'Argo!

42:25.627 --> 42:26.742
John, where are you?

42:26.837 --> 42:28.327
Uh...

42:28.422 --> 42:31.209
I'm not entirely sure right
now. What's up with Scorpius?

42:31.299 --> 42:33.676
We had a small problem with his
door, but that's already sorted.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.341
You're long overdue.
Is everything okay?

42:35.429 --> 42:39.217
Hey, hey, we're not dead.

42:39.307 --> 42:41.263
How drad is that?

42:41.351 --> 42:42.215
( laughing )

42:42.310 --> 42:44.437
( chuckles )

42:47.232 --> 42:49.063
( whistles )

42:49.151 --> 42:52.769
Mmm. Interesting day?

42:52.863 --> 42:54.649
They're all interesting.

42:54.740 --> 42:58.073
This was more like...
confusing.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.697
And a warrior needs clarity.

43:02.706 --> 43:04.071
I'm not a warrior.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.121
You carry a weapon.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.459
Second Amendment.

43:06.543 --> 43:09.205
Besides, it's Scorpy's war,
not mine.

43:09.296 --> 43:12.208
Thousands dead, billions
in the balance.

43:13.467 --> 43:16.425
But that's not the war
I'm speaking of.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.258
Aeryn.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.510
The war of the heart.

43:26.396 --> 43:28.773
Always Aeryn.

43:30.108 --> 43:34.898
Yeah, I don't... think too
clear where Aeryn is concerned.

43:34.988 --> 43:37.730
Pain clouds judgment.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.623
Distillate of Lake.

43:49.836 --> 43:53.294
One whiff, and the
pain is gone,

43:53.381 --> 43:54.917
for a time.

43:55.008 --> 43:57.249
It'll help you forget
about Aeryn.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.428
Oh, and please don't thank me.

44:02.516 --> 44:05.974
It's been 150 cycles
since I've...

44:07.646 --> 44:12.265
since I've felt for someone
the way you do for her.

44:16.863 --> 44:18.649
Hmm.

44:31.837 --> 44:33.998
I hear I was a princess.
