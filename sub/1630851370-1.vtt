00:01.218 --> 00:03.351
What time's this party
kickin' off?

00:03.525 --> 00:04.569
ADULT ADAM:
Back in the '80s,

00:04.743 --> 00:07.311
my grandpa, Pops,
was the greatest guy ever.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.227
I hear someone turned 16
and could use a new car!

00:10.401 --> 00:12.055
He was my partner in crime...

00:12.229 --> 00:13.665
[CELL DOOR SHUTS] ...sometimes literally.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.711
He was always
up for an adventure.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.843
I-I just like
spending time with the boy.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.802
Everyone loved Pops,

00:19.976 --> 00:22.370
which is why
we had such a hard time
when he passed away.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.285
[DOORBELL RINGS] But months later,

00:24.459 --> 00:26.809
we were finally moving on...
sort of.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.551
Oh, hi, Beverly.
How are you?

00:29.725 --> 00:31.248
How are most orphans?

00:31.422 --> 00:33.555
Oh, that's right...
parentless.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.471
I know.
I lost my mom and dad
a few years back, so...

00:36.645 --> 00:37.776
To a car accident?

00:37.950 --> 00:39.300
You are never gonna
know the pain

00:39.474 --> 00:42.172
of losing someone who passes
quietly in their sleep.

00:42.346 --> 00:43.739
Well, you're obviously
still hurting,

00:43.913 --> 00:44.914
but we thought
it might be nice

00:45.088 --> 00:46.481
for you to get out
and take a walk.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.960
Oh, did you?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.310
"We." I... D-Did you
hear me say "we"?

00:49.484 --> 00:51.007
I-It was her idea.She was most insistent.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.835
Essie, could you
for once consider

00:53.009 --> 00:54.750
someone else's feelings?

00:54.924 --> 00:57.100
Your parents may be
extremely unlikable,

00:57.274 --> 00:59.102
but they are still alive.

00:59.276 --> 00:59.885
Okay, well,
if you change your mind...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.626
I will not change my mind.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.717
If you're looking for me,
I will be sitting in the dark

01:05.891 --> 01:07.676
bedazzling
black rhinestones.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.286
Yeah, a sandwich
sounds great.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.201
Poor Bev,
still having a hard time.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.943
Nah, she's good.
She cried at the thing.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.163
Look, all I'm saying is,
your mom is distracted
with grief.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.469
We have a window
to pick our wedding venue
with no interference.

01:18.643 --> 01:21.298
Is it just me, or do you
talk more than you used to?

01:21.472 --> 01:22.778
Come on, how beautiful
would it be

01:22.952 --> 01:24.084
to get married
on a sandy beach...

01:24.258 --> 01:25.955
He's still going.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.696
We could get a rabbi
and a hot air balloon!

01:27.870 --> 01:30.655
Erica's
dismissiveness suggests
she's also struggling.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.048
Eh, she just doesn't
like people.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.658
It's how I raised her.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.965
Erica's not the one
with strong emotions.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.359
Son, is that
a French toast skewer?

01:38.533 --> 01:41.666
I'm too angry
to idly sit and eat.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.191
From now on, all my meals
will be on sticks

01:44.365 --> 01:45.975
to allow
for constant movement.

01:46.149 --> 01:47.977
I know better than to ask,
but why?

01:48.151 --> 01:49.979
Pops had an awesome watch

01:50.153 --> 01:52.721
that commemorated
the first 12 Super Bowls.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.115
Super Bowl One,
Super Bowl Two,
Super Bowl Three...

01:55.289 --> 01:57.117
This one's seeking
a medical degree?

01:57.291 --> 02:00.207
Did he leave me
that cherished heirloom?

02:00.381 --> 02:02.905
No. That went to Adam.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.647
And I got this?!

02:05.821 --> 02:08.824
He knew the only thing I hate
more than reading

02:08.998 --> 02:10.652
is writing.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.393
He knew.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.351
Barry's also not dealing
with his grief.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.397
Instead of crying,
he's raging

02:16.571 --> 02:18.660
and eating food
in an unconventional manner.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.097
He's always angry
and eating stuff on sticks.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.447
Mur, after the hubbub
of my dad's funeral,

02:23.621 --> 02:25.362
that's when
the sadness really hit.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.451
I didn't know
how to deal with it.

02:27.625 --> 02:31.542
I'd spend hours digging
large holes for no reason.

02:31.716 --> 02:34.197
I even gave away
our Swarovski crystal
frog collection.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.547
Crystal frogs?You'd be surprised

02:36.721 --> 02:39.289
at people's affection
for glass amphibians.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.509
Any hand-blown woodland
creature, really.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.728
a bear,
a moose, a raccoon,

02:43.902 --> 02:45.513
spunky chipmunk.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.168
But that's not the point.I would hope not.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.954
I finally got around
to my dad's last wish.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.783
My wife and I
spread his ashes
around an oak tree.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.785
It was his favorite spot.

02:56.959 --> 03:00.397
Now, I put it off because
I was afraid to say goodbye.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.443
But sure enough,

03:02.617 --> 03:05.750
once I faced it,
I felt better.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.362
I wasn't listening,
but that had the rhythm
of you being done.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.059
Come on, Mur.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.669
Just because you're
an emotional black hole

03:11.843 --> 03:13.497
doesn't mean your family
doesn't need help.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.543
Eh, the family's fine.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.719
This one's even back to
doing his weird movie thing.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.243
You know it. Pops and I
were making an homage

03:20.417 --> 03:22.506
to "Bill & Ted's
Excellent Adventure"

03:22.680 --> 03:25.466
cleverly titled "Pops & Adam's
Excellent Adventure."

03:25.640 --> 03:27.990
And it's time
to get back on set.

03:28.164 --> 03:32.037
Using green screen technology,
I can put Pops' face
right here.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.866
So we finish our movie and our
excellent adventure continues.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.173
Maybe I need to do something.Great.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.870
I know.
Ashes around a tree.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.437
That's my thing.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.960
Y-You should think of
something personal.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.005
Already landed
on the tree thing.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.354
Excellent!

[ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]

03:50.795 --> 03:53.058
ADULT ADAM:
It was September 22nd,
1980-something.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.713
Thanks to Bill, my dad's
secret plan to help us grieve

03:55.887 --> 03:57.541
was in motion.Hey, Mur!

03:57.715 --> 03:58.977
Hello, Bill,
my trusted friend

03:59.151 --> 04:00.588
who never lies.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.633
What brings you
to this neck of the woods?

04:02.807 --> 04:04.244
Well, I was just
out patrolling the area

04:04.418 --> 04:05.984
for our community watch.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.943
We've had a few
gruesome stabbings.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.858
Oh, no!Stabbings?

04:10.032 --> 04:11.163
Told them not to put in
that new bus stop.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.340
Gee, Bill, that's a lot
of terrifying information,

04:13.514 --> 04:15.080
but I'm sure that's not
the reason you came over here.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.778
Back on track.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.171
I spotted this envelope
over in your begonias.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.695
Mailman must have dropped it,

04:20.869 --> 04:23.611
and it blew away or something.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.003
[GASPS] It's from
my father's attorney.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.309
Attorney, you say?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.355
It's postmarked
for almost two months ago.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.139
My real inheritance!

04:30.313 --> 04:32.097
Pops gave me that dumb pen
so I can endorse

04:32.272 --> 04:33.925
the $10,000 gold certificate

04:34.099 --> 04:35.275
that clearly fits inside this!

04:35.449 --> 04:36.188
Ah, give it to me.

"that you join together

"in his favorite place."

04:47.025 --> 04:48.375
That's it?

04:48.549 --> 04:49.941
Check the back for
a treasure map

04:50.115 --> 04:51.073
or a deed to a silver mine.

04:51.247 --> 04:52.596
Nothin'."Favorite place"?

04:52.770 --> 04:53.989
That's a little unclear.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.425
It is unclear.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.905
Yes, but it's on

04:57.079 --> 04:57.732
the firm's actual letterhead,

04:57.906 --> 04:59.647
and it has a raised seal

04:59.821 --> 05:01.388
of a horse holding a gavel,

05:01.562 --> 05:03.215
suggesting legitimacy.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.043
Thank you for your
contribution, Bill.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.176
I gotta get back on patrol.

05:07.350 --> 05:08.438
I wonder where Pops meant.[DOOR CLOSES]

05:08.612 --> 05:10.614
Easy, the oak tree
by the driveway.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.181
That's a northern
white cedar.

05:12.355 --> 05:14.618
Great wood for
making traditional
Scandinavian saunas,

05:14.792 --> 05:16.054
canoes, or even
a playful wishing well.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.666
Okay, let's grab the urn
and start a'spreadin'.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.320
No way.
My dad hated that tree.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.104
It had that squawky bird
in it.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.627
Chirping was constant.

05:23.801 --> 05:24.933
Whippoorwill-whippoorwill!

05:25.107 --> 05:26.108
We get it!

05:26.282 --> 05:27.675
Go back to the sky, bird.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.199
Fine,
maybe it wasn't that tree.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.722
But I'm sure it was
another tree that's

05:31.896 --> 05:33.376
within easy walking distance.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.595
A random tree

05:34.769 --> 05:35.813
doesn't seem right.

05:35.987 --> 05:36.858
What was Pops' favorite place?

05:37.815 --> 05:39.730
We need to make a list.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.036
To the board!Oh, no.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.646
Don't you see?

05:42.820 --> 05:44.344
Pops wants us
to figure this out together.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.650
Just one more family quest,

05:46.824 --> 05:48.565
compliments of the best
time-travelling bro

05:48.739 --> 05:50.045
a guy could ask for.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.786
[AS TED] Not bogus.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.051
Is he getting weirder?

05:56.225 --> 05:57.357
ADULT ADAM:
My dad's simple plan

05:57.531 --> 05:59.750
was turning into anything but.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.405
First up,
narrowing down a list
of Pops' favorite places.

06:02.579 --> 06:03.841
There's Paris.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.756
He helped liberate
a whole country.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.976
You know, Paris
would be a romantic
destination wedding.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.934
Ugh, never mind.Sorry, my love.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.720
By trying to satisfy
your every desire,
I made it about me.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.505
The truth is, your grandfather
was very proud to have served,

06:15.679 --> 06:19.117
but the French people
he found to be filthy [BLEEP]

06:19.291 --> 06:21.119
What about the fridge?
He was in there enough.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.165
What about the deli?Pops loved the deli

06:23.339 --> 06:26.255
almost as much as he hated me
by giving me this useless pen.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.779
The deli it is.All right,
let's honor his wish

06:28.953 --> 06:31.956
and spread his ashes
in a suburban sandwich shop.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.350
He did love that deli with
the big barrel of sour pickles

06:34.524 --> 06:35.743
and that lady
with the thing on her face

06:35.917 --> 06:37.658
that we all just ignored.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.182
No, he loved the deli
with the beef tongue
in the display case.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.053
He'd say to the guy,
"How's it taste?"

06:42.227 --> 06:44.055
and the guy would say,
"Oh, it doesn't anymore."

06:44.229 --> 06:46.275
And they'd laugh,
and he'd order bagels.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.277
No, Pops liked the one

06:48.451 --> 06:50.801
with the big salamis
hanging in the window.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.542
He let me use two
as nunchucks once.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.501
They...hurt my belly
two different ways.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.807
He loved our peoples' food
too much!

06:56.981 --> 06:57.939
This letter sucks!

06:58.113 --> 06:59.114
It's way too vague!

06:59.288 --> 07:01.508
Bill found this
in our flowers?

07:01.682 --> 07:03.945
Bill's not great
with specifics
or friendship.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.773
And that doesn't even
sound like your Pops.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.949
He'd either say what he meant,
like when he called me a wuss,

07:08.123 --> 07:09.559
or he'd make a game out of it,

07:09.733 --> 07:11.082
like when he made me
play Hangman,

07:11.256 --> 07:11.996
and the answer was "wuss."

07:12.170 --> 07:14.172
That's it!
It is a game.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.652
And the letter has
the clues!

07:15.826 --> 07:17.828
Yeah, I think we're giving
the letter too much power.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.526
Would a lawyer
really have a seal

07:19.700 --> 07:21.310
with a horse
wielding a gavel?

07:21.484 --> 07:23.965
Or does the horse
mean something else?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.140
The race track!Ugh.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.663
And just like that... Go!

07:26.837 --> 07:29.274
...we were off to honor
my grandpa's last wish,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.233

actually made one.

crime scene.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.157
So, where's this
gonna happen?

07:42.331 --> 07:44.942
I thought
we'd scatter his ashes
around the track.

I'm gonna find a manager
