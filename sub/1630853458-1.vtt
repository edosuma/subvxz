WEBVTT

00:12.925 --> 00:15.711
about boys when I was growing
up in the Greek community

00:15.754 --> 00:19.758
especially, I thought it
was because I was less.

00:19.802 --> 00:23.240
And what happened was
when I understood history,

00:23.284 --> 00:25.286
I realized it wasn't me.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.397
Goodbye now.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.756
Okay, what is this?

01:03.498 --> 01:07.241
This is the second one,
two scripts and this.

01:12.115 --> 01:14.378
They wanna pay,
classical stage is paying

01:14.422 --> 01:16.380
a whopping $542 a week,

01:18.252 --> 01:20.254
plus pension and health.

01:23.257 --> 01:26.608
You wonder why actors
flee to Hollywood.

01:31.787 --> 01:32.614
Hello.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.529
He did what?

01:39.273 --> 01:42.885
Oh, the Lysistrata, the
Greek thing at The Getty.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.148
Yeah, see I remember
plays and theaters

01:45.192 --> 01:50.110
it's just people I don't
remember their name.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.242
I look okay right?

01:52.286 --> 01:53.330
It's fun.

01:53.374 --> 01:56.203
I figure I should have fun here.

01:56.246 --> 02:01.121
It's not supposed to be serious
or glamorous or blah, blah.

02:03.297 --> 02:06.474
This is too big for
this outfit right?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.954
- Yeah.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.783
- I wonder what it is in people

02:11.827 --> 02:15.483
that makes it possible
for them to tolerate,

02:16.875 --> 02:18.573
such disorder around themselves.

02:18.616 --> 02:22.707
I always think maybe they
got something I don't have.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
Maybe their minds
are so orderly.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.015
See my mind is like chaotic

02:26.058 --> 02:28.757
so I have to have
order around me.

02:29.975 --> 02:33.240
It can't be disorder
out and disorder in.

02:34.415 --> 02:37.940
Diane Ladd is going
to speak and Ed Asner.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.653
He's so funny he
keeps telling me

02:55.697 --> 02:59.527
that he's taking Viagra and
that we should go away together.

02:59.570 --> 03:03.139
He's a lot of fun.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.058
Let me get over here.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.842
- You dyed your hair.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.587
I think it looks beautiful.
I think I'll try it.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.939
I find her to be a
magnificent actress

03:22.854 --> 03:27.511
and to have this magnificent
actress placed in concrete,

03:29.774 --> 03:31.211
on these streets,

03:32.908 --> 03:37.652
shaming the lack of talent
among so many other actresses

03:38.261 --> 03:39.088
on this street.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.224
I think it's a great tribute

03:44.267 --> 03:48.967
to the quality of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce,

03:49.011 --> 03:50.839
I commend them highly.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.973
This is talent up the wazoo.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.938
- What does
the star mean to you?

04:05.288 --> 04:08.726
- I'm so loathed to
answer that question.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.904
Because it doesn't
mean anything to me,

04:12.948 --> 04:16.343
and I feel like I'm ungrateful
and shouldn't be that way.

04:16.386 --> 04:20.608
I don't mean that
I feel

04:20.651 --> 04:22.305
It just doesn't.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.307
- It just
doesn't do anything for you?

04:24.351 --> 04:25.917
- No it doesn't.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.571
Am I glad I'm getting it?

04:27.615 --> 04:29.138
Of course I'm glad
I'm getting it.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.662
Anytime your work is
acknowledged you're glad.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.229
- Oh, there it is.

04:34.970 --> 04:38.756
- And of course the big thing
is all my kids are together.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.889
- If the star
doesn't do it for you,

04:40.932 --> 04:44.284
what do you think
would get you excited?

04:47.156 --> 04:50.290
- The Academy Award
meant a great deal to me.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.683
That was significant to me,

04:52.727 --> 04:56.252
because that was a
specific piece of work.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.174
You know what song I love?

05:05.217 --> 05:06.044
Misirlou.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.429
- There she is.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.388
Miss America.

05:47.651 --> 05:48.652
Miss New Jersey.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.785
How are you darling?

05:50.828 --> 05:52.830
- I have to say this.

05:52.874 --> 05:57.008
That bastard at the
Toronto Film Festival

05:57.052 --> 05:59.184
rejected Cloudburst.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.664
- What did we do?

06:00.708 --> 06:02.579
As I step to the plate.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.842
Did we do something bad?

06:04.886 --> 06:05.756
- Yes.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.454
- What did we do?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.847
- I think you turned down
Thom Fitzgerald's latest film.

06:09.891 --> 06:10.935
- Oh, we did, did we?

06:10.979 --> 06:13.155
- Yes, it's called Cloudburst.

06:13.198 --> 06:13.938
- And you're in it?

06:13.982 --> 06:14.983
- I am in it.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.724
- And Brenda Fricker's in it.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.117
- And we were told
it was because

06:19.161 --> 06:23.992
our performances weren't good
enough and the film meandered.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.341
- Wow.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.298
- Geez they could
have just said no.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.125
- Yes exactly.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.868
- Why didn't he just say no?

06:30.912 --> 06:32.522
- That wasn't me.

06:32.566 --> 06:35.917
- I was instructed by Thom
not to mention this at all,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.136
so now I'm blaring it out!

06:39.660 --> 06:43.403
You stupid cock-sucking
pig, you little dick,

06:46.101 --> 06:50.410
you piss-faced monkey, you are
a shitty little short stump

06:50.453 --> 06:51.933
but I stood by you.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.543
I'm gonna kick your ass.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.589
- Do not threaten
a police officer

06:55.632 --> 06:56.677
- Fuck, you!

06:57.982 --> 06:59.680
Do you have anything
to do with this?

06:59.723 --> 07:02.030
- Nothing actually,
nothing Olympia.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.466
- Alright.
- I haven't seen the film.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.687
- Just say she had a
couple of tequila's.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.953
Somebody said that, fight
ye devils, I hate peace

07:11.996 --> 07:14.216
and that has always.

07:14.259 --> 07:15.870
- What a great line.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.089
- Oh, it is, since I was like
14, 15 fighting the Irish

07:18.133 --> 07:19.264
on the street

07:22.224 --> 07:24.139
with a knife in my pocket.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.271
- What a girl.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.273
- Well, what a street.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.840
- I bet you were a
tough Greek girl.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.669
- No I wasn't, yes maybe I was,

07:32.713 --> 07:34.976
but that phrase has always.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.936
Fight ye devils, I hate peace.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.422
- I saw Olympia in
New York in a play.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.730
I think it was a
Mike Nichols play.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.123
- Andrew Bergman's.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.081
- Social Security.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.474
- Social Security.

07:54.517 --> 07:57.128
- I was just blown
away with her timing.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.956
I just felt that
here was an actress

07:59.000 --> 08:03.395
that had some of the best
comedic timing I had ever seen

08:03.439 --> 08:06.790
and I just saw her
as Cher's mother.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.663
- So this is the lead-in
to this very complex scene

08:09.706 --> 08:12.840
that ends the film that Norman
was talking about earlier.

08:12.883 --> 08:15.495
We're all kind of
fascinated in how a director

08:15.538 --> 08:16.800
works with an actor.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.541
- You've got a love
bite on your neck.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.978
He's coming back this morning.
What's the matter with you?

08:21.022 --> 08:23.328
Your life is going
down the toilet.

08:23.372 --> 08:26.767
Cover up that damn thing.
Come on put some make up on.

08:26.810 --> 08:27.594
- Yeah, alright.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.903
- Well, I think we
did an improvisation,

08:32.947 --> 08:36.385
and that line, your life
is going down the toilet

08:36.428 --> 08:38.213
was part of the improvisation.

08:38.256 --> 08:43.174
I have to say what I did
was I channeled my mother,

08:43.218 --> 08:47.527
with the pinching,

08:47.570 --> 08:51.574
with the finger pointing
and that line of course.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.534
I looked at it
again and I thought

08:54.577 --> 08:58.146
wow, my mother was my
first acting teacher.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.194
My mother was a disciplinarian,

09:03.238 --> 09:05.370
my mother had a little
arsenal in the corner.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.895
She had belts, she had sticks.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.727
Her job was to keep
shame from the family.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.206
That was her job.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.600
And she saw what I was like.

09:17.644 --> 09:18.906
I was rebellious.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.560
I was independent.

09:20.603 --> 09:23.475
I was all these different
things and that scared her.

09:23.519 --> 09:26.653
And she tried to do all
these different things to me.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.438
She tried to teach me
shame, can you imagine?

09:29.481 --> 09:31.614
She would stand there in
front of me and slap me,

09:31.658 --> 09:33.616
She says, "Cry you
have no shame."

09:33.660 --> 09:35.096
She wanted me to feel shame.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.184
I was like,

09:36.227 --> 09:37.881
I wouldn't feel any shame.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.884
I'd go to the bathroom and
cry so she didn't see me.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.408
Listen I was 19 years old,

09:43.452 --> 09:45.193
I'd gone out on a
date or something.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.804
She found my pants
in the laundry.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.851
I'm sure she checked
my pants all the time.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.287
Now though when I
look back I realize,

09:52.330 --> 09:54.115
what was she doing
with my pants?

09:54.158 --> 09:57.727
She takes my pants and she
confronts me with them.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.730
What is the meaning of this?

10:00.774 --> 10:02.993
- Oh, my god.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.604
- Her eyes are like blazing.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.083
- But why?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.998
I must have creamed in
my pants or something,

10:08.042 --> 10:09.521
who knows what?

10:09.565 --> 10:12.873
She comes after me with
my pants, shaking them,

10:12.916 --> 10:15.353
and I'm standing
there and I tell you,

10:15.397 --> 10:16.703
you know what I said to her?

10:16.746 --> 10:20.445
I said look, I am
bigger than you are now.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.709
You hit me, I'm
hitting you back.

10:22.752 --> 10:25.842
I had to tell her
and she backed off.

10:26.974 --> 10:30.151
- She fought the
battles in the family.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.718
And I watched her,

10:31.761 --> 10:35.156
she was much more upfront
with what she wanted.

10:35.199 --> 10:38.115
My parents had
certain ideas of her

10:39.029 --> 10:40.378
behaving in certain ways

10:40.422 --> 10:42.380
and she would have
to fight her battles.

10:42.424 --> 10:47.037
I watched that and there was
a lot of emotional turmoil

10:47.081 --> 10:51.694
in the house because of the
differences of what she wanted

10:51.738 --> 10:54.305
and the way my parents
wanted her to be.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.787
- She was not a conventional
kid in many ways.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.616
I mean junior New
England Fencing Champion.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.097
I mean how many Greek kids
were fencing champions

11:03.140 --> 11:04.315
or even fenced?

11:04.359 --> 11:05.752
- You know the interesting thing

11:05.795 --> 11:07.667
about that New England
fencing championship?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.233
Did I ever tell you this?

11:09.277 --> 11:13.368
I got on the mat, I had
been working with a master.

11:13.411 --> 11:16.850
I went from French fencing
which was very detailed

11:16.893 --> 11:21.768
and not aggressive and then
I saw these Hungarian women

11:21.811 --> 11:23.421
come to the Boston Fencing Club

11:23.465 --> 11:27.208
and they had Italian foils
and they were, "Hey Ha",

11:27.251 --> 11:29.819
all these sounds were
coming out of them.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.170
I go on the mat and
that person comes at me

11:33.214 --> 11:38.219
and I start "Hey Ha", and I
drive that person off the mat.

11:39.568 --> 11:42.571
I won, that match by
driving, you can get points

11:44.007 --> 11:46.618
if you drove people off the
mat two times, three times

11:46.662 --> 11:47.576
or whatever, you got a point.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.186
Drove her off the mat.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.884
And he comes up to me and says,

11:50.927 --> 11:52.886
"Okay Olympia I don't
want you to do this now,

11:52.929 --> 11:53.887
I want you to fence."

11:53.930 --> 11:55.758
And I say, "Okay."

11:55.802 --> 11:59.719
I get on the mat, and it
comes out of me again.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.898
Then I do it the second
time and I win the match.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.596
He says, "I'm gonna
pull you from the match.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.467
Stop this, right now."

12:10.817 --> 12:15.256
So I realized that he's
really serious, so I stopped.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.697
These women were all Anglo Saxon

12:25.179 --> 12:28.530
from the sister
colleges of New England.

12:30.184 --> 12:34.362
I was from BU that didn't
even have a fencing team

12:36.756 --> 12:41.151
and here were these privileged,
entitled Anglo Saxons

12:44.589 --> 12:49.420
and I was 18, 19 years old
screaming and yelling "Hey Ha".

12:51.988 --> 12:56.297
- We were surrounded by
many Brahmin types of girls.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.432
And both of us had
strong ethnic roots

13:01.476 --> 13:05.828
so I think we banded together
as a way of protection.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.313
We were both miss-matched
at the school.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.967
We really didn't belong there.

13:14.010 --> 13:17.448
The messages we received
in the 50's were

13:18.885 --> 13:22.279
that you assumed very
traditional roles.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.587
But she moved beyond
the acculturation,

13:26.980 --> 13:30.505
she moved beyond the
messages of the time.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.420
And I've often pondered.

13:32.463 --> 13:36.467
What is it that makes
people go beyond the pack?

13:37.860 --> 13:41.908
To strive where other people
kind of stop and yield

13:41.951 --> 13:46.086
to the pressures of society,
the traditional roles,

13:46.129 --> 13:48.436
what is it, what
is the motivation?

13:48.479 --> 13:50.960
Anyway she had it, she had it.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.973
- I've never felt
that I was a part

14:04.017 --> 14:07.368
of the theatrical
community in New York.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.111
I was too identified ethnically

14:11.154 --> 14:14.288
which was a very old theme
that started when I was young

14:14.331 --> 14:17.508
and Greek and fighting
in the streets.

14:18.683 --> 14:22.122
It's very difficult
to talk about because

14:22.165 --> 14:27.127
I suppose in the end it's
simple, I just didn't belong.

14:27.170 --> 14:31.435
And who in America doesn't
have an outsider feeling?

14:31.479 --> 14:35.657
I mean there are so
many immigrant groups.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.877
At first I tried to get
away and then I realized

14:37.920 --> 14:41.576
what I have to do is go into
it, just the opposite of that.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.360
I have to do the opposite.

14:43.404 --> 14:48.322
Because that not belonging has
been very much a part of me,

14:49.758 --> 14:53.109
not just in my work,
but also as a woman.

14:56.243 --> 15:00.551
But it never goes away,
that thing of being outside,

15:03.206 --> 15:05.730
that thing of being different,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.037
and of course what
happens is you think

15:08.081 --> 15:09.473
there's something wrong with you

15:09.517 --> 15:12.389
and that what you
need to do is fix it.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.915
You know fix it, do
this, do that, fix it.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.966
Finding a way to live
with who you are,

15:24.010 --> 15:28.275
and not insist on fixing
at a certain point

15:28.318 --> 15:30.755
becomes the name of the game.

15:49.818 --> 15:52.038
Wanna see my three figures?

15:53.213 --> 15:54.518
My crones?

15:54.562 --> 15:57.652
It's a virgin, she's
had a tough time.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.395
Virgin, Mother, Crone.

16:02.352 --> 16:04.964
Three phases of a woman's life.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.184
This is where I'm at.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.406
- Good morning,

16:13.494 --> 16:15.452
my entree into the
world of documentaries.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.063
- Thank you so much Bon.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.326
You know who I have to
call? Brenda Fricker called.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.632
What is it in Ireland right now?

16:21.676 --> 16:22.720
- Five hours.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.288
- They are ahead of us?

16:25.332 --> 16:26.159
- Five o'clock now.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.160
- You want her?

16:27.203 --> 16:29.118
- Yeah, lets do it quickly.

16:29.162 --> 16:30.772
She got a job.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.642
She's so happy.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.731
She spoke to Lou Lou.

16:33.775 --> 16:35.516
Are you on two Bonnie?

16:35.559 --> 16:36.386
- Yeah.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.227
I think it cut out.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.360
- I'll send her an email.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.842
- What do you want to say?

16:57.886 --> 16:58.713
- Brendie.

17:05.807 --> 17:09.680
How great, I was happy, so
happy to hear you're working.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.379
I know how much it means to you.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.383
In Manchester!

17:16.426 --> 17:17.427
What's the part?

17:17.471 --> 17:18.907
What's the movie?

17:21.692 --> 17:24.043
How's weight watchers?

17:24.086 --> 17:27.089
And what are you
doing with your dog?

17:31.224 --> 17:35.402
New paragraph, Brendie,
today is my 80th Birthday,

17:39.449 --> 17:41.364
can you believe it?

18:12.091 --> 18:15.746
Some people don't know
who the fuck I am.

18:23.928 --> 18:28.411
Oh, my arms are getting tired
I never thought of that.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.912
- The thing about
"Tales of the City"

18:50.955 --> 18:53.610
was that most of us who
participated in it knew

18:53.654 --> 18:56.570
that we were committing
a revolutionary act.

18:56.613 --> 19:00.878
Olympia knew that she was
part of something historic.

19:00.922 --> 19:04.012
And she knew that what she was
saying through that character

19:04.055 --> 19:05.361
had not been said before.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.582
Not with such
affection and clarity.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.150
Olympia was really the only
one I got excited about

19:11.193 --> 19:12.934
to play Anna Madrigal.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
There were other name actresses

19:14.588 --> 19:17.243
but nobody I felt could
really nail all of the things

19:17.286 --> 19:20.724
that are required to
play a transgender,

19:20.768 --> 19:23.292
flamboyant, mother hen.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.252
- It was a fearless and
groundbreaking portrayal

19:26.295 --> 19:29.429
at a time when that
kind of imagery

19:29.472 --> 19:32.171
in entertainment media
simply did not exist.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.303
When we did the original
Tales of the City,

19:34.347 --> 19:36.218
it was a kind of
brave new world.

19:36.262 --> 19:40.657
Not just in the depiction of
a transgender leading lady,

19:40.701 --> 19:42.659
but also just in terms of

19:42.703 --> 19:47.229
the depiction of same sex
attraction, same sex romance,

19:47.273 --> 19:49.188
same sex relationships

19:49.231 --> 19:52.800
and the whole idea of
an LGBT based family.

19:54.410 --> 19:58.675
- As for me, my favorite
year hasn't happened yet.

19:58.719 --> 19:59.633
- Right on.

20:02.636 --> 20:05.160
It's going to be 90 or 80 so.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.815
I'll be 65 or so.

20:12.254 --> 20:15.344
I can collect social security

20:15.388 --> 20:18.913
stash some away, buy
a small Greek island.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.350
- Right on.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.658
- Actually I'll settle
for a small Greek.

20:27.617 --> 20:31.099
- Please
welcome, Olympia Dukakis.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.495
- When I had to play this
character, Anna Madrigal,

20:35.538 --> 20:38.237
I said to Alan
Poul, the producer

20:39.194 --> 20:41.544
I said I've got to meet someone,

20:41.588 --> 20:44.330
I've got to talk to someone
who's gone through this.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.506
I have to understand
what this is.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.204
And so they actually
found a woman,

20:49.248 --> 20:51.511
who was now a sex therapist,

20:53.295 --> 20:55.950
and we sat and
talked one morning,

20:55.993 --> 20:58.909
and the first question
I said to her,

20:58.953 --> 21:02.739
"What was it that you
wanted, that you needed?"

21:03.610 --> 21:05.655
Because I knew by that time

21:05.699 --> 21:09.355
how incredibly difficult
the operations were

21:09.398 --> 21:14.098
and all of this psychological
journey that had to be taken.

21:14.142 --> 21:18.059
And I said what was it
that you needed so much?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.105
And she said,

21:21.149 --> 21:25.893
"All my life I yearned for
the friendship of women."

21:25.936 --> 21:29.026
It really knocked me
out and from then on,

21:29.070 --> 21:32.900
I understood that, you know
I've had that in myself.

21:32.943 --> 21:37.513
I keep trying to find within
myself aspects of who I am

21:40.037 --> 21:43.127
as a woman and to somehow
share that with other women

21:43.171 --> 21:44.781
and I understood immediately.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.741
Not the particulars
of her journey

21:47.784 --> 21:50.439
but really the heart of it.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.659
I think it's great
that you're all here,

21:52.702 --> 21:55.705
I'm looking forward
to a wonderful weekend

21:55.749 --> 21:59.405
and I hope you have
the same, thanks a lot.

22:02.103 --> 22:05.324
I don't know what I
thought she was gonna say.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.718
I thought she was
gonna talk about sex.

22:08.762 --> 22:12.505
And she didn't, she
talked about a human need

22:14.245 --> 22:17.292
she had that instantly
as an actress

22:17.336 --> 22:21.383
made it possible for me to
connect with the character.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.385
- Do you know if
she's still in San Francisco?

22:23.429 --> 22:24.647
- She what?

22:24.691 --> 22:25.648
- Do you know if
she's still here?

22:25.692 --> 22:27.171
- She was in LA actually.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.869
- Look who's just
accosted her in the lobby.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.000
- Oh, my god.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.829
Oh, you came!

22:33.700 --> 22:35.615
- We just realized we crossed.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.834
We're not leaving
until the morning

22:37.878 --> 22:40.489
so I called Bonnie just
to say goodbye to you

22:40.533 --> 22:43.100
and she said you're gonna be,

22:43.144 --> 22:46.539
I'm so happy about
this I can't tell you.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.672
- I'm gonna run upstairs,

22:49.716 --> 22:51.761
you're gonna go to
your dinner now?

22:51.805 --> 22:53.676
- No, we don't have
to go till30.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.809
- Oh, let's sit down
and have a drink.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.158
- Yeah.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.420
- Okay sit down so
what are we having?

22:58.464 --> 23:00.727
A couple of pizzas
and champagne?

23:00.770 --> 23:02.076
Sound good to you?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.643
- Champagne is good for us.

23:03.686 --> 23:04.470
- Okay

23:04.513 --> 23:05.688
What is this?

23:05.732 --> 23:07.603
It looks like scrambled eggs.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.388
- It does, doesn't it?

23:09.431 --> 23:11.085
- Chris and I,

23:11.128 --> 23:15.089
I was asked to ride in the
Palm Springs Gay Pride parade

23:15.132 --> 23:16.786
- Oh, yeah.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.484
- And they put us in this
vintage, this sort of kit car,

23:18.527 --> 23:21.138
you know a kind of vintage
Duesenberg or something

23:21.182 --> 23:24.054
that was the pride and joy of
the man who was driving it.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.099
And no sign.

23:25.142 --> 23:26.230
- They forgot to make a sign.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.318
- They didn't make a sign.

23:27.362 --> 23:28.407
- So no one knew who you were?

23:28.450 --> 23:31.148
So it was like, "Who are you?"

23:35.892 --> 23:36.980
I don't know.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.901
The only real fun we
had was we past a corner

23:44.945 --> 23:46.947
where there was some
nut-bag Christians,

23:46.990 --> 23:49.602
you know screaming and
yelling about god hates fags,

23:49.645 --> 23:52.866
and so we kissed for
like three minutes.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.607
- Good for you!

23:54.650 --> 23:58.611
- And they were just like, they
were just uttering nonsense.

23:58.654 --> 24:02.266
They said "fags fucking
fags" and I thought,

24:03.224 --> 24:05.226
who else do you want us to fuck?

24:08.795 --> 24:11.798
Generally I try to
pick another fag.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.586
- Who else do you
want us to fuck?

24:17.630 --> 24:18.892
- We do need to run.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.371
- Okay.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.851
- I hate that but we do
have somebody waiting.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.593
- Can the Reverend Jim
Brown what's his name?

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
- Gene Robinson.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.031
- I tell you what
were missing out,

24:28.075 --> 24:31.731
now what we should do
is smoke a little pot.

24:33.167 --> 24:36.692
- You know we could invite
him if you plan to stay here.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.305
It will be like a play.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.220
The bishop is arriving.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.530
- Alright my dears, be well.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.054
- I'm an octogenarian you know,

24:51.098 --> 24:52.099
so watch it.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.060
- She's an octogenarian
motherfucker!

24:58.192 --> 24:59.715
- Can I quote you?

24:59.759 --> 25:02.109
I'm an octogenarian
motherfucker!

25:02.152 --> 25:03.502
That's what I am.

25:05.939 --> 25:09.769
You know I had a lot
of different reasons
to go on stage.

25:09.812 --> 25:13.250
I first got a hold that there
was something else going on

25:13.294 --> 25:17.298
when I realized that if I could
become a good craftsperson

25:17.341 --> 25:20.997
I had a reason to feel
good about myself.

25:21.041 --> 25:24.566
Then, I realized that
if I can go on stage

25:24.610 --> 25:26.829
and do it better
than other people,

25:26.873 --> 25:30.354
I could get parts,
I could get noticed,

25:30.398 --> 25:33.488
I could get more money,
I could get better parts.

25:33.532 --> 25:37.187
Then, that kind of
played itself out.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.146
I realized what I lost was

25:39.189 --> 25:41.931
the feeling of playing
with other people.

25:41.975 --> 25:45.369
'Cause when you're trying
to win, you don't play.

25:45.413 --> 25:48.198
You try to win, you
try to be better.

25:48.242 --> 25:50.549
I didn't mind being competitive.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.594
Growing up I've been that way.

25:52.638 --> 25:56.163
So it was like, "Okay,
let's go, I know this one.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.730
I'll do this."

25:57.773 --> 26:00.515
Except one day I didn't
want to go to stage anymore

26:00.559 --> 26:01.995
I've got my hand on a door knob

26:02.038 --> 26:04.780
and I didn't want
to go on stage.

26:06.260 --> 26:10.786
And that was really something,
I had to deal with that.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.622
I realized that in New York,

26:20.666 --> 26:23.582
I was going to play
very specific parts.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.627
They would not give
me those parts.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.889
I couldn't even get auditions

26:26.933 --> 26:29.065
because my name was
Olympia Dukakis.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.719
They said, "Oh,
she's too ethnic"

26:30.763 --> 26:34.418
They didn't even know me,
see me, hear me, the name!

26:34.462 --> 26:36.595
What you do is, you
say to yourself,

26:36.638 --> 26:39.989
"Oh, it's not gonna happen.
That's the structure.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.644
That's what it is,
what are my options?"

26:42.688 --> 26:45.647
My option was to
start my own theater.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.344
I could do the parts I want.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.129
I could select the plays I want.

26:49.172 --> 26:52.175
I could work with
the people I want.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.962
I could feel like I
was in the theater.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.834
If you do it
yourself, its harder.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.750
But that's what it is

27:01.794 --> 27:04.448
If they don't give it to you,

27:04.492 --> 27:08.714
for whatever reason, you have
to then make it yourself,

27:08.757 --> 27:11.281
you have to like
build it yourself

27:11.325 --> 27:13.022
and for that you need patience.

27:13.066 --> 27:15.938
- We began the theater in 1973

27:15.982 --> 27:18.811
in what was the
old Baptist church.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.248
We raised money
any way we could,

27:21.291 --> 27:23.903
and it was extraordinary
because we didn't succumb

27:23.946 --> 27:26.296
to being a commercial entity.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.647
- Olympia had such
high standards.

27:28.690 --> 27:32.825
I mean she was, her feeling
is that only the best.

27:34.696 --> 27:37.656
And she, actually
that whole group

27:37.699 --> 27:41.660
worked to make sure it was the
best and they took chances.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.532
I mean it was a very exciting
theater company to see

27:44.575 --> 27:47.230
because of that and because
it sort of was enthused

27:47.274 --> 27:50.320
with her spirit which
is nothing but the best.

27:50.364 --> 27:53.193
- She did a performance
of The Rose Tattoo

27:53.236 --> 27:56.370
at her theater in
Montclair, New Jersey.

27:56.413 --> 27:59.416
And she was an inspiration to me

27:59.460 --> 28:04.378
in that world, I knew very
few Greeks in that world

28:05.771 --> 28:08.382
And so her success and
her integrity as an actor

28:11.254 --> 28:13.517
moved me and inspired me.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.128
- And her theater,
The whole theater,

28:15.171 --> 28:16.825
I don't know if you
knew her at that time,

28:16.869 --> 28:19.872
but I went very often to
Montclair, New Jersey.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.743
That was an amazing thing

28:21.787 --> 28:24.833
because they did all
kinds of crazy stuff.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.183
Sometimes people were ready,
sometimes they weren't

28:27.227 --> 28:29.142
and then they would
talk to the audience,

28:29.185 --> 28:30.883
really talk to the audience.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.581
And other people pretend
to talk to the audience,

28:33.624 --> 28:35.583
but she really talks to them.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.281
She really wants to
know, what did you get?

28:38.325 --> 28:39.848
Where was your mind?

28:39.892 --> 28:41.154
What did you feel?

28:41.197 --> 28:42.155
What did you listen for?

28:42.198 --> 28:43.591
Did you hear that argument?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.549
- Stop ruining the girls
at the high school.

28:45.593 --> 28:46.942
- Stop Serafina.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.510
Let's go home.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.863
- No no no, I ain't through
talking to this here teacher.

28:54.907 --> 28:58.345
- Serafina look at yourself
you're not dressed.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.696
- I'm dressed okay,
I'm not naked.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.395
- This last summer I saw
her do Mother Courage

29:05.439 --> 29:07.920
with Shakespeare and Company.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.183
And at the end of the play

29:10.226 --> 29:12.011
when she pulls that cart around

29:12.054 --> 29:15.057
I turned to my husband and
I said, you know that's it.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.494
You don't have to see
more theatre, that's it

29:17.538 --> 29:20.584
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.849
And her generosity on a stage,

29:23.892 --> 29:25.938
being with her is the most

29:25.981 --> 29:28.201
generous thing that
can happen on a stage

29:28.244 --> 29:29.898
and that doesn't always
happen with somebody,

29:29.942 --> 29:33.380
who has her qualifications
or her status.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.691
And she's totally open and crazy

29:42.693 --> 29:45.305
give me craziness every time.

29:45.348 --> 29:46.915
- There were film actors,

29:46.959 --> 29:48.612
there were television actors,
there were stage actors

29:48.656 --> 29:53.052
and it was very verboten to
move from world to world.

29:53.095 --> 29:56.098
So she was one of the
first people to do that.

29:56.142 --> 29:59.710
Very brave of her
because it was.

29:59.754 --> 30:04.280
at the time, you know
sort off looked down on.

30:04.324 --> 30:07.806
But she was sort of
the gateway of I think

30:07.849 --> 30:09.808
the Hollywood community going,

30:09.851 --> 30:12.288
"Oh, there are theater
actors out there,

30:12.332 --> 30:14.421
oh, they're really good."

30:15.683 --> 30:17.293
- I watched her
in the last piece

30:17.337 --> 30:20.514
she did in LA, where
she didn't speak.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.953
Oh, my god it was stunning.

30:24.997 --> 30:29.697
To watch a woman on stage for
two hours, not say a word.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.834
And present a whole
life, a whole history.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.012
I could cry thinking
about it because she just,

30:40.055 --> 30:41.709
she's extraordinary.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.972
- She's a
total professional,

30:44.016 --> 30:48.150
she does not play diva
or mamselle or goddess,

30:48.194 --> 30:50.152
she doesn't pull any rank.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.632
She's all heart,

30:51.675 --> 30:53.460
she's very professional

30:53.503 --> 30:56.855
and she's a perfectionist
and I like that.

30:56.898 --> 31:00.859
But she gives to you
what she expects totally.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.512
She doesn't pull any games.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.775
- he's like a summer
storm you know.

31:04.819 --> 31:07.300
Sometimes it's really blue skies

31:07.343 --> 31:10.390
and then it starts to get
a little dark and then,

31:10.433 --> 31:12.522
you know it gets really dark
and then it's light again

31:12.566 --> 31:14.046
and then it rains.

31:15.177 --> 31:18.746
She's everything you
want her to be and more.

31:20.052 --> 31:24.056
Her range is frightening
and wonderful to watch,

31:24.099 --> 31:26.275
it's what every actor wants.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.668
I want it.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.583
- Whenever your name came up

31:29.626 --> 31:32.020
it was always about the work.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.719
And the great parts she played

31:41.856 --> 31:45.773
and how she brought her
uniqueness to the part.

31:49.037 --> 31:51.605
If somebody says on my deathbed

31:52.998 --> 31:54.390
what do you remember
about Olympia,

31:54.434 --> 31:56.349
it's those two or three

31:58.307 --> 32:00.614
incredible, incredible parts

32:02.224 --> 32:05.488
that no-one in this fucking
country ever touched her.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.969
I have seen people
do Mother Courage

32:08.013 --> 32:09.928
and they didn't know what
the fuck they were doing

32:09.971 --> 32:14.193
at the very end but
when she got to the end

32:14.236 --> 32:16.412
and she picked up that wagon.

32:16.456 --> 32:20.416
Like she's going to
endure through anything,

32:20.460 --> 32:22.984
and I used to stand
in the wings weeping,

32:23.028 --> 32:25.247
weeping every night.

32:25.291 --> 32:29.077
- I met Olympia at the
Williamstown Theater Festival,

32:29.121 --> 32:32.602
her first summer up there when
she and Louis were up there

32:32.646 --> 32:35.214
was in 1961 when I wasn't there.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.651
But I came back in the
fall and asked around

32:37.694 --> 32:40.436
from people who had been
there so what was it like

32:40.480 --> 32:43.570
and they kept talking about
'Olympia' or Olympia and Louie.

32:43.613 --> 32:46.399
They kept talking
about these people.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.227
It's about one of my
favorite relationships

32:48.270 --> 32:50.011
that I've ever known.

32:53.014 --> 32:57.192
They embrace each other in
every sense of the word.

32:57.236 --> 33:01.457
They recognize each other
on such a deep level.

33:01.501 --> 33:06.506
They recognize the value of
each other in a very profound,

33:07.550 --> 33:10.292
intuitive and sometimes
even funny way.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.251
Whatever was going
on between them

33:12.294 --> 33:14.470
would flow right into the scene.

33:14.514 --> 33:17.256
It came in the door with
them every day of rehearsal,

33:17.299 --> 33:18.909
like a dog.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.824
I mean it just came in.

33:20.868 --> 33:22.609
- She and Louie her husband,

33:22.652 --> 33:26.743
were just always working and
that was the life that we saw.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.921
That we were exposed to.

33:30.965 --> 33:34.708
It was not that over
blown sort of Hollywood.

33:36.536 --> 33:40.279
It was working class
and it was professional.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.456
- They work so well together

33:44.587 --> 33:47.068
and that includes
fighting and laughing.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.724
They share their work
and they share each other

33:50.767 --> 33:52.334
as two actors.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.728
Olympia thinks Louie is the
best actor in the world.

33:54.771 --> 33:59.254
She has boundless respect for
him and he makes her laugh

33:59.298 --> 34:02.866
and he calms her down.
He's home base for her.

34:02.910 --> 34:07.219
And she's a thrilling
pain in the ass for him.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.048
- Emily, wake up, come on.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.875
- For god sakes, what is it now?

34:11.919 --> 34:14.748
- Sit up I want
you to look at me.

34:16.706 --> 34:19.144
- You always do this to me.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.798
- I have the most amazing idea.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.023
- You're crazy.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.591
- Not just me, the two of us.

34:31.634 --> 34:35.464
- The breathing will
improve, it's just a phase.

34:35.508 --> 34:38.554
- No it's not just the breathing
you idiot it's everything.

34:38.598 --> 34:41.557
No golf, no sex life,
no friends left,

34:41.601 --> 34:43.342
no one to illustrate my books.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.908
- What about Leverson?

34:44.952 --> 34:46.910
- Leverson died last
November for Christ sake.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.912
- There are lots
of young artists

34:48.956 --> 34:50.566
who would love to work with you.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.134
- Nobody wants to
work with an old man.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.309
- What about my headaches?

34:54.353 --> 34:55.832
Do you hear me complain?

34:55.876 --> 34:58.574
If life doesn't give you
exactly what you want

34:58.618 --> 35:00.402
you want to take
your ball and go home

35:00.446 --> 35:02.839
and what's worse you
want to take me with you?

35:02.883 --> 35:04.276
- Only if you want.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.625
- Well I don't.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.022
- Time for a cocktail.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.894
- Let's get a drink after this.

35:13.937 --> 35:14.982
- Yeah.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.592
Yeah, let's have a drink.

35:16.636 --> 35:17.419
- Yeah.

35:17.463 --> 35:18.290
- Definitely.

35:18.333 --> 35:19.247
Your hands are cold.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.335
- I know it.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.423
- You're freezing in here right?

35:21.467 --> 35:22.772
- Yeah, but warm heart.

35:27.037 --> 35:31.259
This tonight my spirit
shall give thee cramps.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.349
Pinch thee til thou bloodeth,

35:34.393 --> 35:37.744
give side stitches
to pen thy breath up.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.445
- A south west blow on ye
and blister you all over.

35:43.489 --> 35:47.797
- Each pinch, more stinging
than bees that made em.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.020
- I
must eat my dinner.

35:53.063 --> 35:55.153
- I must eat my dinner.

35:55.196 --> 35:58.330
- Then I've got it,
I've got it, Okay.

35:58.373 --> 36:01.898
Is that it? Maybe
it's done then?

36:01.942 --> 36:03.117
That was good!

36:06.903 --> 36:08.209
I got it now

36:08.253 --> 36:11.386
There's more work
for thee, no there's.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.260
No I can just walk
away from you,

36:15.303 --> 36:17.827
no, there's, I can
just take it now.

36:17.871 --> 36:20.482
I've got it now,
there's more work for,

36:20.526 --> 36:23.311
there, there's
more work for hmm.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.488
- I must eat my dinner!

36:28.925 --> 36:30.884
- I love watching
you winding it up,

36:30.927 --> 36:34.757
Okay, I'm having an impulse,
I'm not sure what it is.

36:34.801 --> 36:36.455
- Yeah, right I'm
having four of them!

36:36.498 --> 36:37.673
- I'm having an impulse.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.066
I'm having four of them

36:39.109 --> 36:40.546
that's the problem I
have four impulses.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.069
- Where is it gonna go?

36:42.112 --> 36:44.811
- You made much of me,
you made what he said,

36:44.854 --> 36:45.855
you made much of me.

36:45.899 --> 36:47.727
- You think he gets to me?

36:47.770 --> 36:49.511
- A little bit.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.904
You made much of me,

36:50.947 --> 36:52.601
you've given me water
with berries in it.

36:52.645 --> 36:56.605
You did that, you treated me
really well, you taught me.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.521
You did all that
and I loved you.

36:59.565 --> 37:02.568
And I think the audience
needs to hear that.

37:02.611 --> 37:05.658
Not only as part of the
relationship to understand it,

37:05.701 --> 37:08.617
but I think as now
you as a woman.

37:08.661 --> 37:09.705
- I'm reasoning now.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.707
- You know, I have taught you.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.057
- Yes, he's learnt
something, right?

37:14.101 --> 37:15.537
And the thing about is.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.366
- And you should
love me, this is true

37:18.410 --> 37:22.022
- Right, right,
that's true, and that.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.415
- I just heard it,

37:23.458 --> 37:24.764
imagine you've been
saying it all this time

37:24.807 --> 37:26.940
and I just dropped in.

37:26.983 --> 37:30.944
- Teaching really
became, what acting was,

37:30.987 --> 37:34.991
it was a way of my reaching
for my own identity,

37:36.515 --> 37:40.432
my own humanity, my
own contradictions,

37:40.475 --> 37:43.696
my own darkness, my own shit.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.264
What are you afraid of doing?

37:46.307 --> 37:47.830
Something wrong?

37:47.874 --> 37:51.138
You're in a basement
on Clinton Street.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.972
What the fuck are
you gonna do wrong?

37:59.015 --> 38:01.888
I came in with
very, strong issues.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.632
I didn't know I
had strong issues.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.286
I didn't know this.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.465
Greek was a big one.

38:13.508 --> 38:16.163
First generation was a big one.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.995
Sexual bias was a big one.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.998
- What do
you mean sexual bias?

38:25.041 --> 38:26.129
- Growing up.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.307
Yeah, I saw it.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.135
I saw it in the Greek community.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.661
In very strong ethnic
communities around me,

38:35.704 --> 38:37.576
they were that way.

38:37.619 --> 38:39.578
I saw those things.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.189
I came in with those things.

38:42.232 --> 38:45.627
I didn't understand
how much anger I had.

38:45.671 --> 38:47.716
Of course I don't
have any more anger.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.111
- No you
completely calmed down.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.722
- Olympia is trying to get me

38:53.766 --> 38:55.637
to deal with who I am

38:55.681 --> 38:59.859
and I'm telling her about
a breakthrough that I had

38:59.902 --> 39:02.992
in the scene and she's
like, "Get out of here."

39:03.036 --> 39:04.777
I'm like, "What?"

39:04.820 --> 39:07.780
"Get out of here, get out of
here and don't come back until

39:07.823 --> 39:10.609
you figure out why I'm throwing
you out of this class."

39:10.652 --> 39:14.090
And I'm trying to understand,
you know, what happened.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.615
I asked for a meeting
for us to get together.

39:16.658 --> 39:17.833
And she says to me,

39:17.877 --> 39:21.010
"Tony, what do you think I am?

39:21.054 --> 39:22.490
Do you think I'm a book

39:22.534 --> 39:25.232
that you can pull
down off the shelf,

39:25.275 --> 39:29.149
take the information out,
close it and put it back?

39:29.192 --> 39:31.151
I'm invested in you.

39:31.194 --> 39:33.327
I'm not just your teacher."

39:33.371 --> 39:35.721
You know and I'm like, "Wow."

39:37.113 --> 39:39.725
I mean it struck
me in such a way,

39:39.768 --> 39:42.728
no-one had ever cared
for me that way.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.860
- What else you got inside?

39:44.904 --> 39:47.515
Remember I talked about
an actor being a prism?

39:47.559 --> 39:49.517
Having all these different faces

39:49.561 --> 39:51.606
which are all
different characters.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.740
What else have you got in there?

39:54.783 --> 39:58.657
- Having a woman as
a teacher is very interesting

39:58.700 --> 40:03.705
because Olympia probably
invented the feminist movement.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.534
She was one of the
first ones there.

40:06.578 --> 40:10.582
She's very honest and she
doesn't like it when women

40:11.757 --> 40:14.586
do that subservient
feminine thing

40:16.283 --> 40:18.851
to get what they want with men.

40:18.894 --> 40:22.115
I mean I could just see the
hackles raise on her neck

40:22.158 --> 40:24.334
and she always called
them out on it.

40:24.378 --> 40:28.121
I was watching this
actress work with Olympia.

40:28.164 --> 40:31.777
And she was, you know
more and more frustrated

40:31.820 --> 40:34.475
with this actress because
this actress was like,

40:34.519 --> 40:36.434
"Oh, oh, I don't know."

40:38.958 --> 40:42.918
She was feeling and
very sort of very oh

40:42.962 --> 40:45.181
and Olympia you know
was like looking at her

40:45.225 --> 40:47.401
and just getting
angrier and angrier

40:47.445 --> 40:51.449
and trying to evoke some,
basic, emotive aspects,

40:55.844 --> 40:59.500
something that was going
to be pure and real.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.242
And I'm thinking wow this
is interesting you know.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.810
This woman really going
after another woman

41:04.853 --> 41:07.595
and calling her out on
this feminine, you know,

41:07.639 --> 41:11.338
these games and, "Oh,
oh, I don't know, oh."

41:12.992 --> 41:16.082
And Olympia finally,
she had a cigarette

41:16.125 --> 41:19.520
and she leans forward, and
she looks at her and she goes.

41:19.564 --> 41:23.872
"Cut the shit bitch your
cunt drips just like mine."

41:27.528 --> 41:29.530
- I had an acting
class I was teaching

41:29.574 --> 41:32.228
and there was an
African American girl

41:32.272 --> 41:33.795
and a very beautiful girl.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.494
But she came to class
everyday with her wig on,

41:36.537 --> 41:40.410
her make up on, so I said
to her listen, I said,

41:40.454 --> 41:42.978
"I wish you would come
someday without make up

41:43.022 --> 41:44.458
and without your wig."

41:44.502 --> 41:48.593
So she's working one
day and I just went up

41:48.636 --> 41:52.466
and I took that wig and
fucking yanked it off.

41:54.381 --> 41:56.383
She went after my throat.

41:56.426 --> 41:58.037
- Oh, she did?

41:58.080 --> 42:00.430
- Oh, she did and we were
on the floor, the two of us.

42:02.563 --> 42:04.957
We were on the floor

42:05.000 --> 42:08.526
and at a certain
point we both stopped.

42:08.569 --> 42:12.051
We realized whatever
had been spent was spent

42:12.094 --> 42:13.531
and we sat there.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.229
The class was horrified.

42:16.272 --> 42:17.883
Today I would've been fired,

42:17.926 --> 42:20.146
it would have been
like abuse you know,

42:20.189 --> 42:23.628
you couldn't do the things
we did at NYU at the time

42:23.671 --> 42:25.804
and get away with them today.

42:25.847 --> 42:29.416
- Here, hit this, go
ahead M'Lynn slap her.

42:31.897 --> 42:32.941
- Are you crazy?

42:32.985 --> 42:33.855
- Hit her!

42:33.899 --> 42:35.335
- Are you high Clairee?

42:35.378 --> 42:37.032
- Clarisse have
you lost your mind?

42:37.076 --> 42:40.862
- We'll sell T-shirts saying
I slapped Ouiser Boudreaux.

42:40.906 --> 42:42.124
Hit her!

42:42.168 --> 42:44.170
- Miss Clairee enough.

42:44.213 --> 42:46.476
- Ouiser, this is your
chance to do something

42:46.520 --> 42:48.478
for your fellow man.

42:48.522 --> 42:50.611
Knock her lights out M'Lynn!

42:50.655 --> 42:52.047
- Let go of me.

43:22.295 --> 43:25.994
- Woah, this looks like
major shopping here.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.912
Should I get the little
one or the bigger one?

43:30.956 --> 43:32.261
- Yeah, let's get the big one.

43:32.305 --> 43:35.351
- Is that's more
interesting shooting?

43:35.395 --> 43:37.223
- No, I'm just hungry.

43:39.442 --> 43:41.836
- Look at the place there's
too many people here.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.057
Well of course it's
Saturday isn't it?

43:53.674 --> 43:54.457
- Hello.

43:54.501 --> 43:55.458
- Hello.

43:55.502 --> 43:56.721
- How are you?

43:56.764 --> 43:58.200
- Fine.

43:58.244 --> 44:01.116
- It's good to see a
famous actor so close.

44:01.160 --> 44:04.163
- Well it's nice to see you.

44:04.206 --> 44:05.991
- You having a good time here?

44:06.034 --> 44:08.036
- Yes, a very good time.

44:09.298 --> 44:11.387
- Have a good stay.

44:11.431 --> 44:13.259
- Thank you very much.

44:14.434 --> 44:16.654
You want a piece of cheese?

44:31.494 --> 44:32.713
Want some beer?

44:32.757 --> 44:33.714
- I must
be the only person

44:33.758 --> 44:35.063
who recognizes you in here.

44:35.107 --> 44:36.064
- Hello.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.109
- I'm so happy to see you.

44:37.152 --> 44:38.501
- Well, thank you.

44:38.545 --> 44:40.373
- I'm Sarina, this
is Alice, my mother.

44:40.416 --> 44:41.330
- How do you do?

44:41.374 --> 44:42.201
So nice to meet you.

44:42.244 --> 44:43.158
Can I give you a hug?

44:43.202 --> 44:44.116
- Oh, sure.

44:45.421 --> 44:46.466
Okay.

44:46.509 --> 44:48.511
- Can I have a picture with you?

44:48.555 --> 44:50.165
I'm sorry.

44:50.209 --> 44:53.299
- Can you tell me where the
bottled green tea might be?

44:53.342 --> 44:55.954
- The bottled
beverages are here, so.

44:55.997 --> 44:58.434
- Yeah, okay, I'll try that one.

44:58.478 --> 44:59.348
- Yeah.

44:59.392 --> 45:00.349
- She got it?

45:00.393 --> 45:01.655
- Yeah, thank you so much.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.265
- Alright.

45:03.309 --> 45:04.876
- It's not every day that
I bump into Olympia Dukakis

45:04.919 --> 45:05.964
at the grocery store.

45:06.007 --> 45:08.836
- Nice to talk to you, bye now.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.620
- Bye.

45:10.664 --> 45:13.014
- Let's go in here then, oh,
this is not gonna be good here,

45:13.058 --> 45:15.321
they're all going to start.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.254
- My kids will have my
head on a platter for this

45:35.297 --> 45:36.603
you understand?

45:36.646 --> 45:39.301
- We will
censor this scene.

45:39.345 --> 45:43.784
- No this is not Olympia, I'm
impersonating Olympia Dukakis.

45:43.828 --> 45:46.613
I'm in disguise in costume.

45:46.656 --> 45:49.224
It's really made of vegetables.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.707
It's plant life.

46:01.802 --> 46:03.891
Hand me a cigarette, will you?

46:03.935 --> 46:05.501
- No, not in the car.

46:05.545 --> 46:06.938
- I'll open the window.

46:06.981 --> 46:08.330
- Oh, come on.

46:08.374 --> 46:10.245
- Look look, you've
got your window open,

46:10.289 --> 46:12.291
I've got my window open.

46:14.859 --> 46:16.904
- What's was the choice
of drugs for you?

46:16.948 --> 46:17.862
- For me?

46:17.905 --> 46:19.124
- Pot?

46:19.167 --> 46:20.429
- What?

46:20.473 --> 46:21.735
- Pot?

46:21.779 --> 46:23.781
- Ah, yeah, but that wasn't,

46:23.824 --> 46:28.089
well I got addicted about,
for two years to uppers.

46:29.134 --> 46:30.831
- Uppers?

46:30.875 --> 46:34.792
- Upper and lowers, I had a
whole scheme during the day.

46:36.315 --> 46:39.231
I wouldn't get out of bed, I'd
have it right next to my bed.

46:39.274 --> 46:40.275
It was pitiful.

46:40.319 --> 46:41.842
- Why did you stop it?

46:41.886 --> 46:44.671
- Well, it was interesting,
one day I don't know,

46:44.714 --> 46:46.368
I got up and I was
doing something

46:46.412 --> 46:50.111
and I went to the bathroom,
to take some, I don't know,

46:50.155 --> 46:52.461
I was washing my face.
I looked at myself

46:52.505 --> 46:55.856
and it was like literally a
voice in my head that said.

46:55.900 --> 46:58.641
"You're trying to
kill yourself."

46:58.685 --> 47:01.993
And I was like, "That
is what I'm doing

47:02.036 --> 47:04.778
I'm trying to do kill myself."

47:04.822 --> 47:06.475
I had a couple of
episodes of those,

47:06.519 --> 47:09.304
trying to kill myself,
not just with drugs.

47:09.348 --> 47:11.829
I was standing on the sidewalk
and a truck was coming,

47:11.872 --> 47:14.135
and I thought it
would be so easy.

47:14.179 --> 47:17.225
I just go and stand
in front of the truck.

47:17.269 --> 47:21.621
And I did that and a woman
pushed me out of the way.

47:22.796 --> 47:25.494
So a lot of these
drugs were about

47:25.538 --> 47:29.237
trying to run ahead of
everything, trying to.

47:31.370 --> 47:33.763
My management control system.

47:35.940 --> 47:39.813
But then I realized
that if I continued

47:39.857 --> 47:42.685
I was gonna kill myself
with these drugs.

47:42.729 --> 47:44.557
I stopped right there.

47:44.600 --> 47:48.430
When I was in graduate
school in Boston,

47:48.474 --> 47:50.345
I was seeing a therapist.

47:50.389 --> 47:55.394
That first week in
that apartment, I
had an hallucination.

47:56.482 --> 47:58.919
But I had learned about
them by that time.

48:00.268 --> 48:02.140
- This is without drugs?

48:02.183 --> 48:04.925
- Oh, yeah, this
is without drugs.

48:04.969 --> 48:08.886
The last hallucination
I had, I manipulated it.

48:08.929 --> 48:12.367
I thought to myself,
instead of being scared

48:12.411 --> 48:14.065
or instead of being passive

48:14.108 --> 48:17.546
I had learned to become
active with them.

48:17.590 --> 48:22.029
I saw the head of a woman
coming at me like this,

48:22.073 --> 48:23.857
the back of her head,

48:26.512 --> 48:29.950
and I said I'm gonna
see who this is.

48:29.994 --> 48:34.346
And I forced the head to turn
around and it was my mother.

48:34.389 --> 48:38.045
With a Grand Guignol
expression on her face.

48:41.570 --> 48:43.746
Which was a lot of terror.

49:55.905 --> 49:59.866
I think that song is a
silly thing to remember.

50:04.740 --> 50:06.220
On the other hand.

50:18.058 --> 50:18.972
Woah, well,

50:21.540 --> 50:23.324
how are you cuing this?

50:23.368 --> 50:24.978
- Well, Olympia
I'm trying the figure out

50:25.022 --> 50:26.936
the house light as well to
fade the house lights up

50:26.980 --> 50:29.026
because they're so quick.

50:29.896 --> 50:32.551
- Well, what's wrong with that?

50:32.594 --> 50:36.337
If they're quick
take them out last.

50:36.381 --> 50:38.687
- Well I'll take them out
with the cue I was trying,

50:38.731 --> 50:40.254
yeah, I just have
to work on stuff

50:40.298 --> 50:41.081
it's the first
time I've done it.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.343
- Okay.

50:42.387 --> 50:43.823
- But I think we'll
make them work,

50:43.866 --> 50:44.737
I'm gonna try it again
I just need to reset.

50:44.780 --> 50:46.391
- On the other hand.

50:49.220 --> 50:51.135
I heard the go.

50:51.178 --> 50:52.440
Okay

50:52.484 --> 50:53.528
- I thought that
one was too quick.

50:53.572 --> 50:54.877
- You thought it was too quick?

50:54.921 --> 50:56.357
- Yeah, I thought
in was too quick.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.055
- On the other hand.

51:07.716 --> 51:09.501
It's a little late.

51:09.544 --> 51:12.547
- Is it also the house lights
also going out at that time?

51:12.591 --> 51:14.593
- Yeah, well you're asking me

51:14.636 --> 51:16.899
I'm telling you it's a little.

51:16.943 --> 51:20.033
The go has to come
sooner and the fade

51:20.077 --> 51:22.644
needs to be gentle, not abrupt.

51:26.605 --> 51:29.608
On the other hand,
beat, beat, fade.

51:34.047 --> 51:35.527
On the other hand.

51:39.618 --> 51:40.532
Good.

51:40.575 --> 51:41.402
That's it!

51:46.015 --> 51:50.977
Look at the cat with its tail
up, you know what that means?

51:52.196 --> 51:53.501
You wanna fuck or
you wanna fight?

51:53.545 --> 51:55.242
- Alright, I'm not
sure I'll be able

51:55.286 --> 51:57.070
to use that information,
but thank you.

51:57.114 --> 51:58.854
- Why are you alone
for Christ sake?

51:58.898 --> 51:59.681
- Oh, god.

52:00.682 --> 52:02.249
- I mean who's gonna dial 911

52:02.293 --> 52:05.122
when you're laid out
and gasping for air?

52:05.165 --> 52:08.951
- I'm teaching the dog
how to do it actually.

52:09.822 --> 52:11.606
- No one is laughing.

52:14.305 --> 52:17.873
You want to fuck or
you want to fight?

52:17.917 --> 52:19.353
- I want to do neither really.

52:19.397 --> 52:20.833
That's a problem.

52:24.228 --> 52:25.794
First of all let me tell you.

52:25.838 --> 52:29.624
The people of New York
continue to be wonderful.

52:29.668 --> 52:32.105
I was with Louie
once when he fell.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.195
I mean there were ten
men there in two minutes.

52:35.239 --> 52:38.198
Okay buddy, we got you buddy,
don't worry about anything.

52:38.242 --> 52:40.505
I mean I was crying and there,

52:40.548 --> 52:43.725
there was all these
people came to me.

52:44.900 --> 52:45.814
I was like.

52:48.034 --> 52:50.645
And it wasn't for
another 10-15 minutes

52:50.689 --> 52:53.387
that people
understood who I was.

52:54.693 --> 52:55.911
They didn't know.

52:55.955 --> 52:57.261
That wasn't what brought them.

52:57.304 --> 52:58.610
What brought them was

52:58.653 --> 53:00.220
that this white haired old lady

53:00.264 --> 53:02.135
had fallen down on the street

53:02.179 --> 53:06.705
and nearly been killed by a
car and they were fabulous.

53:19.457 --> 53:21.241
- What is
your philosophy?

53:21.285 --> 53:22.111
- On what?

53:22.155 --> 53:23.504
- On death, on dying.

53:23.548 --> 53:24.418
- On death?

53:25.898 --> 53:27.769
So what time is it now?

53:29.249 --> 53:33.166
Five after one, there's
certainly no escaping it.

53:36.387 --> 53:37.823
- Does it scare you?

53:37.866 --> 53:38.911
- Yeah, sure.

53:50.096 --> 53:52.446
Sure, not all the time.

53:52.490 --> 53:55.928
There are moments when it kind
of hits me and I get scared.

53:55.971 --> 54:00.019
- What's the thing that scares
you when you get scared?

54:00.062 --> 54:02.108
- Having no consciousness.

54:04.110 --> 54:05.459
It's the loss of,

54:08.288 --> 54:10.421
what little part of myself

54:11.465 --> 54:14.251
is separate from
everything else.

54:16.949 --> 54:19.212
You know holding onto that.

54:20.344 --> 54:24.043
But my fears about
this happen at night

54:24.086 --> 54:27.220
or sometimes in the day
something will happen.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.136
I'll walk down the street and
they'll be a wonderful wind,

54:30.179 --> 54:33.705
I love wind, and they'll
be a wonderful wind

54:33.748 --> 54:37.099
and I'll feel isn't
this great, the wind

54:37.143 --> 54:41.930
especially in New York when
the wind comes off the river.

54:41.974 --> 54:45.804
And then I think about
not having this anymore

54:47.936 --> 54:52.158
not having that wind and
I have this flash of fear.

55:14.876 --> 55:16.704
- Any regrets?

55:17.662 --> 55:18.663
- Of course.

55:21.056 --> 55:25.887
I regret that I wasn't able
to handle my children better.

55:29.674 --> 55:32.329
I had not good parenting skills,

55:34.461 --> 55:36.463
I don't know what you
want to call that.

55:36.507 --> 55:38.813
I mean not that I didn't
do the best I could.

55:38.857 --> 55:41.120
I did, I know that.

55:41.163 --> 55:44.732
I didn't create boundaries
and disciplines.

55:50.695 --> 55:52.349
Once I'll never forget this.

55:52.392 --> 55:55.090
I left Stefan waiting on
the steps of the High School

55:55.134 --> 55:57.310
with all his hockey equipment.

55:57.354 --> 56:00.661
Just this little kid, everybody
had picked up their kids

56:00.705 --> 56:02.097
and there's Stefan,

56:02.141 --> 56:05.187
it was like 45 minutes
that kid sat there.

56:05.231 --> 56:10.018
Things like that you know
they come back to haunt you.

56:10.062 --> 56:12.543
How could I have
forgotten Stefan,

56:12.586 --> 56:14.196
how could I have forgotten him?

56:14.240 --> 56:16.373
- I was the third,
the third child

56:16.416 --> 56:18.200
the youngest of three.

56:18.244 --> 56:21.073
When I was sophomore
in High School

56:21.116 --> 56:25.207
I was going on a ski trip
where we went to Quebec.

56:25.251 --> 56:27.514
I remember the night
before the trip.

56:27.558 --> 56:29.864
I think it was the first time

56:29.908 --> 56:32.040
I was going out of the country

56:32.084 --> 56:33.912
and I had a list of
things to go through

56:33.955 --> 56:36.218
and it said that one of the
things was a birth certificate.

56:36.262 --> 56:38.786
And so I pick it up
and I'm looking at it.

56:38.830 --> 56:41.746
I just wanted to make sure
I have everything in order

56:41.789 --> 56:44.357
and I'm glancing through
and I see for birthday

56:44.401 --> 56:46.794
it says February 4th.

56:46.838 --> 56:50.929
And I said that's weird, my
birthday is February 5th.

56:50.972 --> 56:54.889
I looked at the time, there
was the time of the birth.

56:54.933 --> 56:56.630
And I was like did
they get it wrong?

56:56.674 --> 56:58.719
Was it maybe at
night, so they didn't,

56:58.763 --> 57:01.330
I was just like this
doesn't make any sense.

57:01.374 --> 57:03.898
So I specifically remember
walking into my parents bedroom

57:03.942 --> 57:07.424
and I said to them, "Mom,
dad this is kinda weird."

57:07.467 --> 57:09.643
My birth certificate
says February 4th,

57:09.687 --> 57:12.559
we always celebrate my
birthday February 5th.

57:12.603 --> 57:17.390
And I remember my Dad going,
"That's right, That's right,

57:19.610 --> 57:24.223
my brother's birthday is
February 5th you are the 4th."

57:25.616 --> 57:28.923
- At the time I kind of wished
my parents were more normal.

57:28.967 --> 57:30.534
You know I looked at
some of my friends

57:30.577 --> 57:33.928
and felt like I wished I
had like the stay home mom

57:33.972 --> 57:36.104
and the Wall Street father
that comes home everyday

57:36.148 --> 57:38.498
but that just wasn't
the way things were.

57:38.542 --> 57:40.544
And there weren't
really any gender roles

57:40.587 --> 57:43.460
in their marriage and we
didn't really as kids.

57:43.503 --> 57:46.593
I was a young, 8 years
old doing my own laundry

57:46.637 --> 57:50.771
because they just decided like
you know they're old enough,

57:50.815 --> 57:52.207
do your own laundry.

57:52.251 --> 57:55.689
I was like, "Crap, I
don't want to do this."

57:55.733 --> 57:57.778
- I think also
because when I grew up

57:57.822 --> 57:59.824
I wanted less boundaries

58:01.173 --> 58:05.003
so I think I gave boundaries
when I shouldn't have.

58:06.439 --> 58:09.964
I should have defined
and delineated and stuff.

58:12.053 --> 58:15.404
Fortunately for my
sons they had sports.

58:16.318 --> 58:18.190
But my daughter didn't.

59:16.814 --> 59:18.032
Would you hand me that?

59:18.076 --> 59:19.556
I just noticed it.

59:35.746 --> 59:38.836
Oh, it's a drunk
Italian Grandmother.

59:42.448 --> 59:46.887
I have given my definitive
Italian performance I think.

59:46.931 --> 59:49.455
- Yeah, that's better.

59:55.461 --> 59:58.507
- Say, how are we
doing with the Duo?

59:58.551 --> 1:00:00.161
- The Duo?

1:00:00.205 --> 1:00:02.729
- Ask if there's another
actress here, it doesn't matter.

1:00:02.773 --> 1:00:04.601
- I hear that Faye
Dunaway is here.

1:00:04.644 --> 1:00:06.646
- She's got eyelash glue.

1:00:08.256 --> 1:00:09.170
She does.

1:00:09.214 --> 1:00:10.171
- Okay we'll ask.

1:00:10.215 --> 1:00:11.651
We'll call up Faye Dunaway.

1:00:11.695 --> 1:00:14.262
We'll ask the concierge
to call Faye Dunaway

1:00:14.306 --> 1:00:17.004
and ask if she's got any
duo surgical adhesive.

1:00:17.048 --> 1:00:18.266
- Either
that or Elton John.

1:00:18.310 --> 1:00:19.485
- He's got it.

1:00:21.139 --> 1:00:23.620
- Someone said well possibly

1:00:23.663 --> 1:00:25.883
there might be some other
actresses here staying

1:00:25.926 --> 1:00:27.580
in the hotel.

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:29.713
Do you think we could borrow
some adhesive from some.

1:00:29.756 --> 1:00:32.629
Who's staying at the
hotel do you think?

1:00:32.672 --> 1:00:34.195
- Faye Dunaway

1:00:34.239 --> 1:00:37.938
- Someone said Faye
Dunaway is here.

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:39.723
Yeah, call Faye Dunaway

1:00:39.766 --> 1:00:41.942
and see if she can
lend Olympia Dukakis

1:00:41.986 --> 1:00:44.466
some of her adhesive
for her eyeliner.

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:47.339
I don't know what
they use it for?

1:00:50.124 --> 1:00:54.085
Okay whichever comes first,
the drug store or Faye Dunaway.

1:00:54.128 --> 1:00:55.260
Okay, goodbye.

1:00:58.089 --> 1:00:59.960
This is, it's a comedy.

1:01:00.831 --> 1:01:02.833
- What else would it be?

1:01:11.798 --> 1:01:13.495
- And Faye Dunaway said I
wouldn't give that bitch

1:01:13.539 --> 1:01:14.322
a fucking thing.

1:01:21.503 --> 1:01:23.723
- We actually graduated
from the same college.

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:25.116
- That's right.

1:01:25.159 --> 1:01:27.161
- She graduated from
Boston University.

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:30.077
I mean I think I
graduated before she did.

1:01:30.121 --> 1:01:31.513
Yeah, I remember that.

1:01:31.557 --> 1:01:32.906
- Nice to meet you,

1:01:32.950 --> 1:01:35.039
you're so handsome, you
look great together.

1:01:35.082 --> 1:01:36.780
- Thank you, thank you so much.

1:01:36.823 --> 1:01:38.607
- Goodbye, thank you.

1:01:39.783 --> 1:01:41.262
- You're welcome bye.

1:01:41.306 --> 1:01:42.350
- Bye.

1:01:42.394 --> 1:01:43.787
- Isn't he great?

1:01:45.179 --> 1:01:46.964
- You got everything right?

1:01:47.007 --> 1:01:49.053
- I've got my glasses.

1:01:49.096 --> 1:01:52.186
Now I'm really, now
I'm getting excited.

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:56.713
- Hey, the elevator's waiting,
the elevator's waiting.

1:01:59.628 --> 1:02:00.934
Is my hair curly?

1:02:01.892 --> 1:02:03.197
How's my hair?

1:02:03.241 --> 1:02:04.982
More more, wait wait.

1:02:06.418 --> 1:02:08.028
- No no, don't pat in down.

1:02:08.072 --> 1:02:09.421
- It's too wild.

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:13.512
- And now
I'd like to welcome

1:02:13.555 --> 1:02:15.253
ladies and gentleman.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:22.129
- The
nominees for an actress

1:02:22.173 --> 1:02:23.696
in a supporting role are.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:26.220
- Olympia Dukakis
in "Moonstruck".

1:02:31.573 --> 1:02:35.142
- Why would a man need
more than one woman?

1:02:36.578 --> 1:02:37.797
- I don't know.

1:02:39.712 --> 1:02:42.106
Maybe because he fears death?

1:02:43.281 --> 1:02:46.110
- That's it, that's the reason.

1:02:46.153 --> 1:02:47.328
- I don't know.

1:02:47.372 --> 1:02:49.635
- No, that's it, thank you,

1:02:51.289 --> 1:02:54.292
thank you for
answering my question.

1:02:56.381 --> 1:02:59.036
- And the winner is.

1:03:01.081 --> 1:03:03.823
- Olympia
Dukakis in Moonstruck.

1:03:22.711 --> 1:03:24.322
- Well, I'm very honored.

1:03:24.365 --> 1:03:27.107
I want to thank the
members of the academy.

1:03:27.151 --> 1:03:30.807
I want to say yet again,
thank you to Norman,

1:03:30.850 --> 1:03:35.812
to Patrick Palmer and to John
Patrick Shanley, to my family,

1:03:37.030 --> 1:03:39.641
my husband who has
been my companion

1:03:39.685 --> 1:03:43.254
through my career, through
my life, to my friends

1:03:43.297 --> 1:03:46.823
and colleagues in New York
and The Whole Theater.

1:03:46.866 --> 1:03:50.391
Thank you very much,
okay Michael let's go!

1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:54.047
Michael.

1:03:54.091 --> 1:03:55.483
- You were fantastic.

1:03:55.527 --> 1:03:57.268
- Michael did you watch it?

1:03:57.311 --> 1:04:00.227
- Watch it, we watched it
for a second time here.

1:04:00.271 --> 1:04:01.402
Oh, you're unbelievable.

1:04:01.446 --> 1:04:03.013
- This is like a
Roman spectacle.

1:04:03.056 --> 1:04:04.492
This is unbelievable.

1:04:04.536 --> 1:04:05.972
- What are we
doing here, you and I?

1:04:06.016 --> 1:04:07.365
- I don't know, I don't know.

1:04:07.408 --> 1:04:09.280
- Just a couple of
street kids, that's all.

1:04:09.323 --> 1:04:12.109
- I don't understand
how this all happened.

1:04:12.152 --> 1:04:14.372
- You were great
we're proud of you.

1:04:14.415 --> 1:04:16.113
- Thank you, bye.

1:04:16.156 --> 1:04:18.028
- Okay Olympia, bye, bye,
my best to everybody.

1:04:18.071 --> 1:04:19.638
- Right bye.

1:04:19.681 --> 1:04:20.900
Oh, it's great.

1:04:20.944 --> 1:04:22.859
Do you think I can
call my mother?

1:04:22.902 --> 1:04:24.338
- Did you
ever think that Olympia

1:04:24.382 --> 1:04:26.123
would have this kind of success?

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:27.167
- No, never.

1:04:28.299 --> 1:04:29.126
- Why not?

1:04:30.431 --> 1:04:32.607
- Because it took so long.

1:04:33.913 --> 1:04:38.657
I thought she was one of
the ordinary actresses.

1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:40.789
This is a surprise to me.

1:04:46.534 --> 1:04:49.407
- Listen, when this
thing happened,

1:04:49.450 --> 1:04:52.062
with this guy that
was my first love,

1:04:52.105 --> 1:04:54.020
very much in love with.

1:04:54.064 --> 1:04:57.371
I got a letter from him,
his parents didn't want me.

1:04:57.415 --> 1:05:00.200
I just went to the mirror and
looked at myself and I said.

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:02.028
"Now what are you going
to do with your life?"

1:05:02.072 --> 1:05:04.335
I mean I just went forward.

1:05:06.511 --> 1:05:07.991
I did not want to.

1:05:09.427 --> 1:05:11.951
But of course what
happened to me was

1:05:11.995 --> 1:05:14.171
that I just closed off.

1:05:14.214 --> 1:05:16.477
I closed my heart down.

1:05:16.521 --> 1:05:20.090
I mean I'd go out with people
I'd have affairs with them

1:05:20.133 --> 1:05:22.135
but, no feelings.

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:25.312
I experienced it as
nothing and no one

1:05:25.356 --> 1:05:28.402
is going to take over again.

1:05:28.446 --> 1:05:31.231
My life is going to be
what I want it to be.

1:05:31.275 --> 1:05:33.059
- Were you a
very sexual person?

1:05:33.103 --> 1:05:36.193
- Yeah, I mean I
was like in the time

1:05:37.629 --> 1:05:40.327
when you could do this, the
queen of one night stands.

1:05:40.371 --> 1:05:43.069
Because it was always different,
each man was different.

1:05:43.113 --> 1:05:47.247
You never knew what it
was going to be like.

1:05:47.291 --> 1:05:48.988
How they were going to kiss.

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:51.599
How they were gonna
feel inside of you,

1:05:51.643 --> 1:05:54.254
what they were going
to do to your body,

1:05:54.298 --> 1:05:56.256
you didn't know what
was going to happen.

1:05:56.300 --> 1:06:01.261
Of course it was then that I
met Louie, at the same time.

1:06:02.349 --> 1:06:04.090
- Was that
like a one night stand?

1:06:04.134 --> 1:06:06.571
- No, no I knew, I knew.

1:06:06.614 --> 1:06:11.010
I knew almost immediately
with Louie that first night.

1:06:11.054 --> 1:06:13.970
And the next morning
I wouldn't leave.

1:06:14.013 --> 1:06:15.667
I thought I was
in a French movie.

1:06:15.710 --> 1:06:18.583
I had a black slip on
and I was sitting around.

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:23.370
I remember thinking he can
kick me out, that's it,

1:06:23.414 --> 1:06:24.937
but I am not leaving.

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:26.634
- I remember her eyes.

1:06:26.678 --> 1:06:30.073
They were kind of heavy lidded
and they were very sexy.

1:06:30.116 --> 1:06:32.684
And I said, "Oh,
my god this woman."

1:06:32.727 --> 1:06:37.297
And then she wasn't a shrinking
violent, she never was.

1:06:39.343 --> 1:06:43.260
And at one point I realized
I was in love with her

1:06:43.303 --> 1:06:47.003
and I was never that
committed to a woman ever.

1:06:47.046 --> 1:06:51.137
I would have one night
stands here there, you know,

1:06:51.181 --> 1:06:54.010
and finally one
day I said to her,

1:06:56.012 --> 1:06:58.971
"Will you me?"

1:06:59.015 --> 1:07:00.581
I could not say it!

1:07:04.368 --> 1:07:08.198
And she realized how
fucking screwed up I was.

1:07:09.677 --> 1:07:11.549
I couldn't even say "Would
you marry me, I love you"

1:07:11.592 --> 1:07:13.203
I couldn't say it.

1:07:13.246 --> 1:07:17.163
I was beginning to feel
feelings I'd never felt before.

1:07:17.207 --> 1:07:19.339
Then I realized
there's something here

1:07:19.383 --> 1:07:23.561
something was going on and
it was my love for her.

1:07:27.043 --> 1:07:29.871
- I remember when I got
pregnant with Christina,

1:07:29.915 --> 1:07:31.917
he was in Stock.

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:35.486
He was having a thing with
somebody not an actress.

1:07:35.529 --> 1:07:40.534
I wasn't at all sure I wanted
to have children at that time.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:44.277
I couldn't get him on the phone.

1:07:44.321 --> 1:07:46.062
So finally I got
him on the phone

1:07:46.105 --> 1:07:48.542
and I told him he had to
come back, we had to talk,

1:07:48.586 --> 1:07:50.675
we had to make this decision,

1:07:50.718 --> 1:07:53.069
about whether or not
to have the baby.

1:07:53.112 --> 1:07:56.202
He said I can't I
only have one day off.

1:07:56.246 --> 1:07:57.899
And I said well,

1:07:57.943 --> 1:08:00.293
I said, "You better
get back here

1:08:00.337 --> 1:08:02.774
or there won't be any
back here to get back to."

1:08:02.817 --> 1:08:05.081
I remember I was like very.

1:08:05.124 --> 1:08:06.517
And he came back,

1:08:07.953 --> 1:08:11.261
and we talked, and he
told me about this woman.

1:08:14.525 --> 1:08:17.789
I mean it was the
least of my concerns.

1:08:23.534 --> 1:08:28.452
I met her eventually, I liked
her, she thought we were odd.

1:08:37.939 --> 1:08:40.681
I'm tired, I'm
gonna go to sleep.

1:08:46.296 --> 1:08:48.646
- I'll tell you what I'm
gonna have one of your apples

1:08:48.689 --> 1:08:49.864
then I'll go home.

1:08:49.908 --> 1:08:51.388
- Okay.

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:52.389
- How do
you spell Edremit?

1:08:52.432 --> 1:08:54.042
- I think it's 'E',

1:08:56.828 --> 1:08:59.352
yeah, it's 'Edre' Edremit.

1:08:59.396 --> 1:09:01.659
Wait, I'm gonna do this one.

1:09:05.532 --> 1:09:07.012
Don't talk.

1:09:15.977 --> 1:09:17.153
- Do it again.

1:09:20.547 --> 1:09:21.983
- I don't know which one to.

1:09:22.027 --> 1:09:23.855
- That sounds
means you can say it.

1:09:23.898 --> 1:09:25.465
- Oh, Okay.

1:09:27.424 --> 1:09:28.947
- Do it
again, press it again.

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:32.429
- Christina,
Christina or Ken Macdonald

1:09:36.563 --> 1:09:38.043
- Can I talk now?

1:09:46.921 --> 1:09:49.924
I'm trying to enter
the 21st century,

1:09:49.968 --> 1:09:53.058
but you can't say a
dammed word, that bitch,

1:09:53.101 --> 1:09:55.365
she picks it up and she's.

1:09:55.408 --> 1:09:58.194
You got to be
absolutely focused.

1:09:59.717 --> 1:10:01.719
Siri, her name is right?

1:10:02.633 --> 1:10:04.243
- Where is it?

1:10:04.287 --> 1:10:08.378
- No you gotta do it like
this, gotta hold it down.

1:10:09.292 --> 1:10:11.990
The town of 'Edremit' in Turkey.

1:10:16.995 --> 1:10:19.476
- When is your meeting?

1:10:21.739 --> 1:10:25.699
- No, I'm talking
about a town in Turkey

1:10:25.743 --> 1:10:27.919
and the name is 'Edremit'.

1:10:34.404 --> 1:10:36.580
- Sorry I
don't understand,

1:10:36.623 --> 1:10:39.060
no I'm talking about
a towel in Turkey

1:10:39.104 --> 1:10:42.107
and the name is
Ederemit okay, when?

1:10:44.892 --> 1:10:49.680
- Let me try again, I'm talking
about a town, not a towel.

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:54.250
In the country of Turkey.

1:10:56.077 --> 1:10:57.688
Now can you help me?

1:11:02.562 --> 1:11:04.260
- I don't know
what you mean by,

1:11:04.303 --> 1:11:07.915
"Let me try again I'm talking
about a town not towels

1:11:07.959 --> 1:11:12.442
in the country Turkey now
can you help me okay, when?"

1:11:15.706 --> 1:11:17.229
- Edremit, Turkey.

1:11:21.364 --> 1:11:23.279
- Sorry I missed that.

1:11:23.322 --> 1:11:25.019
- What the fuck good is she?

1:11:25.063 --> 1:11:26.804
This Siri, 400 bucks.

1:11:29.850 --> 1:11:33.854
Okay, so what's happening
tomorrow Lou Lou bell?

1:11:34.986 --> 1:11:37.597
At two o'clock Lou Lou?

1:11:37.641 --> 1:11:38.772
- What?

1:11:38.816 --> 1:11:41.122
- Do you want to do something?

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:42.123
- At two o'clock?

1:11:42.167 --> 1:11:43.342
- Yeah, what do you wanna?

1:11:43.386 --> 1:11:45.649
- I'll have to
check my schedule.

1:11:52.917 --> 1:11:56.355
- My name is Rocco
Sisto and I am damaged.

1:11:59.619 --> 1:12:03.710
I am damaged because
of these two people.

1:12:03.754 --> 1:12:07.105
So I'm walking up
Broadway two days ago,

1:12:10.326 --> 1:12:13.677
and it's raining, and I'm
coming from an audition

1:12:13.720 --> 1:12:18.029
I have a suit on and I see
this man, on the street.

1:12:19.596 --> 1:12:23.121
And he's walking down
Broadway and so I walk over

1:12:23.164 --> 1:12:28.169
and he looks at me and he
goes, "I didn't recognize you."

1:12:29.301 --> 1:12:31.782
And then he said, "I'm
going to therapy."

1:12:32.913 --> 1:12:36.221
And I thought this
guy is 115 years old.

1:12:37.483 --> 1:12:39.355
He's going to therapy,

1:12:41.052 --> 1:12:44.360
and then I realized
he's married to her.

1:12:45.839 --> 1:12:48.494
Of course he's going to therapy.

1:12:52.193 --> 1:12:53.238
Wouldn't you?

1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.810
- Louie would never,
never walk away.

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:08.514
I would say those things, well
maybe this well maybe that.

1:13:08.558 --> 1:13:10.734
Louie was like rock solid.

1:13:14.128 --> 1:13:17.131
He said I've never loved
anyone in my life like you.

1:13:17.175 --> 1:13:19.743
He was absolutely convinced

1:13:19.786 --> 1:13:23.050
and he was not gonna
walk away from it.

1:13:24.878 --> 1:13:27.533
It was the other day
we were talking about,

1:13:27.577 --> 1:13:29.883
I don't know, somebody was
saying someone was beautiful,

1:13:29.927 --> 1:13:34.105
I said to him, "You never
say that I'm beautiful."

1:13:36.499 --> 1:13:39.806
I said, "Don't you
think I'm beautiful?"

1:13:39.850 --> 1:13:42.418
And he started to laugh, I
said, "Well when we first met

1:13:42.461 --> 1:13:43.810
did you think I was beautiful?"

1:13:43.854 --> 1:13:46.378
He said honestly, he
said, "No I didn't."

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:48.075
I said, "What did you think?"

1:13:48.119 --> 1:13:50.426
He said I've never known anyone
with a spirit like yours.

1:13:50.469 --> 1:13:52.558
I said you can't tell
me you fell in love me

1:13:52.602 --> 1:13:54.081
because of my spirit.

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:56.301
He said, "Yes that's why
I fell in love with you.

1:13:56.344 --> 1:13:58.782
Because of your
spirit not because

1:13:58.825 --> 1:14:01.480
you're the most beautiful
woman I've even been with."

1:14:01.524 --> 1:14:05.223
It was really interesting,
I pouted for a day or so.

1:14:05.266 --> 1:14:07.573
- Was Louie very sexual?

1:14:07.617 --> 1:14:09.314
- Yes, he was, yeah.

1:14:10.358 --> 1:14:12.186
- As sexual as you or?

1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:17.496
- Differently, differently.

1:14:22.719 --> 1:14:25.504
I was more let's try
this, let's do that

1:14:25.548 --> 1:14:29.160
let try this, lets go
there, lets do this.

1:14:34.295 --> 1:14:37.473
He was the one that
had more feelings.

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:43.827
He was the one that
helped me get my feelings

1:14:45.263 --> 1:14:49.659
because I could make love
but I didn't have feelings.

1:14:52.357 --> 1:14:54.359
Louie cried, I was like.

1:14:57.493 --> 1:14:58.798
- Does that ever stop?

1:14:58.842 --> 1:14:59.625
- What?

1:14:59.669 --> 1:15:00.887
- Being sexual?

1:15:00.931 --> 1:15:02.019
- You know what?

1:15:02.062 --> 1:15:04.108
It doesn't, it doesn't,

1:15:04.151 --> 1:15:06.632
it's really interesting.

1:15:06.676 --> 1:15:08.547
To continue to think,

1:15:08.591 --> 1:15:12.769
that you're going to have
the kinds of experiences

1:15:14.074 --> 1:15:17.687
and interaction that you
have when you're younger

1:15:17.730 --> 1:15:21.342
of course is to lie
about what's the truth.

1:15:23.823 --> 1:15:26.565
I was talking to a couple of
women when we were together

1:15:26.609 --> 1:15:28.524
and I said, "You
know it's interesting

1:15:28.567 --> 1:15:32.484
how you always take a
hard prick for granted."

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:35.574
That you think there's
always gonna be a hard prick.

1:15:35.618 --> 1:15:38.882
You never think that, you know.

1:15:38.925 --> 1:15:42.146
You dance with somebody,
bang, their prick is hard.

1:15:42.189 --> 1:15:45.758
You know, you rub against
somebody, the prick is hard.

1:15:45.802 --> 1:15:47.847
But then the day comes

1:15:47.891 --> 1:15:51.634
when you can't take for
granted a hard prick.

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:56.464
- Yeah, that's the
one, cute little thing.

1:15:56.508 --> 1:15:58.162
Beautiful eyes.

1:15:58.205 --> 1:16:00.381
- That's what I
thought, I love his eyes.

1:16:00.425 --> 1:16:02.253
- Reminds me of my Nat
that's why I wanted him.

1:16:02.296 --> 1:16:03.602
- Nat was your dog?

1:16:03.646 --> 1:16:05.430
- No my husband.

1:16:05.473 --> 1:16:07.388
He died at the deli last year.

1:16:07.432 --> 1:16:10.478
Went for some half and half
for my coffee never came back.

1:16:10.522 --> 1:16:13.177
I should've just drank it black.

1:16:14.265 --> 1:16:15.571
- I'm sorry.

1:16:15.614 --> 1:16:18.486
- You kind of have
his build you know.

1:16:18.530 --> 1:16:23.274
That's what I liked when I was
young, feel a man's weight.

1:16:23.317 --> 1:16:25.885
Helps you forget your troubles.

1:16:28.105 --> 1:16:32.370
We were doing "The
Trojan Women", my
brother was directing.

1:16:32.413 --> 1:16:35.199
We had spent the summer
adapting it ourselves.

1:16:35.242 --> 1:16:38.332
We get into rehearsal
and coincidentally

1:16:38.376 --> 1:16:40.683
I happened to be
across the street

1:16:40.726 --> 1:16:43.555
looking for opening night
presents for the set designer

1:16:43.599 --> 1:16:47.603
and I saw a book called
"Perseus and the Gorgon".

1:16:49.126 --> 1:16:51.171
And I remembered Perseus, my
father talked about Perseus.

1:16:51.215 --> 1:16:54.305
This great Greek hero
who united Greece.

1:16:54.348 --> 1:16:58.178
It talked about Perseus,
but not like my father.

1:16:58.222 --> 1:17:01.138
She said Perseus
went around Greece.

1:17:02.139 --> 1:17:04.358
Razed the temples.

1:17:04.402 --> 1:17:07.753
Killed the priests
and priestesses,

1:17:07.797 --> 1:17:09.973
buried all their artifacts

1:17:11.452 --> 1:17:14.847
and this was the phrase that
got me and still gets me.

1:17:14.891 --> 1:17:18.416
Buried in oblivion and
covered in silence,

1:17:18.459 --> 1:17:21.288
the teachings of
the Great Mother.

1:17:21.332 --> 1:17:22.899
And I'm like, what?

1:17:25.336 --> 1:17:29.688
First what Great Mother and
what are these teachings?

1:17:29.732 --> 1:17:32.473
So I started to look for it,

1:17:32.517 --> 1:17:35.215
and it wasn't until I was
in a Buddhist bookshop

1:17:35.259 --> 1:17:37.783
and I was pushing books around

1:17:37.827 --> 1:17:40.786
trying to see what was there
and a book fell off the shelf.

1:17:40.830 --> 1:17:45.617
And it was, cover down, and
I reached, looked at it,

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:49.490
picked it up and it said,
"When God was a Woman"

1:17:49.534 --> 1:17:51.318
by Merlin Stone.

1:17:51.362 --> 1:17:54.626
I took it home and it
totally blew my mind.

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:59.326
I would come running out
of my room to Louie saying

1:17:59.370 --> 1:18:02.634
listen to this, then
I'd go back inside.

1:18:03.766 --> 1:18:06.507
I couldn't believe
what I was reading.

1:18:06.551 --> 1:18:09.728
History, I was reading history,

1:18:09.772 --> 1:18:13.732
Herstory, H-E-R-S and
what had happened.

1:18:13.776 --> 1:18:16.909
How life had been
matrifocal and matrilineal.

1:18:16.953 --> 1:18:19.869
At the time when it was
matrifocal and matrilineal,

1:18:19.912 --> 1:18:21.914
society was egalitarian.

1:18:26.658 --> 1:18:30.488
I began to find the
research and those people,

1:18:34.144 --> 1:18:38.931
the historians who had actually
written about this period.

1:18:38.975 --> 1:18:42.630
And so it began to ground
me I began to feel,

1:18:42.674 --> 1:18:44.981
I could lend myself to this,

1:18:46.373 --> 1:18:48.767
I could permit myself to open

1:18:51.683 --> 1:18:54.730
my imagination and
my feelings to it.

1:18:56.166 --> 1:19:00.561
So I'm having this massage
and I hear this voice

1:19:00.605 --> 1:19:03.042
saying to me, "Celebrate her."

1:19:05.479 --> 1:19:10.267
And then I feel an androgynous
presence in the room

1:19:10.310 --> 1:19:14.750
and I really got scared and
started to cry and I said,

1:19:14.793 --> 1:19:18.710
"I don't know how to celebrate.
I know how to suffer,

1:19:18.754 --> 1:19:21.234
but I don't know
how to celebrate."

1:19:21.278 --> 1:19:23.628
And she said to me, "You do.

1:19:24.934 --> 1:19:27.371
You are of her and you know."

1:19:31.288 --> 1:19:34.508
For 25,000, God was
a woman, not a man.

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:39.949
And it was simple why
that was the case.

1:19:39.992 --> 1:19:42.386
The woman carried the child.

1:19:42.429 --> 1:19:45.606
The woman then actually
birthed the child.

1:19:45.650 --> 1:19:48.740
And then the woman
actually fed the child.

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:52.700
All from her body, like
the body of the planet.

1:19:54.528 --> 1:19:55.878
So what was sacred?

1:19:55.921 --> 1:19:57.836
Sacred was imminent.

1:19:57.880 --> 1:19:59.969
It was within the form.

1:20:00.012 --> 1:20:04.538
The tree, the sacredness of
the tree as it bore fruit.

1:20:05.670 --> 1:20:07.846
The sacredness of the river

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:11.110
as it gave water and
nurtured the plants.

1:20:11.154 --> 1:20:14.592
They saw what was
sacred as imminent

1:20:14.635 --> 1:20:16.768
within the world around.

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:20.380
How could man compete
with woman with this?

1:20:21.555 --> 1:20:22.556
He couldn't.

1:20:23.644 --> 1:20:26.038
So that had to be diminished.

1:20:26.082 --> 1:20:28.084
That had to be lessened.

1:20:30.390 --> 1:20:34.003
Perseus destroyed the
temples of the Great Mother.

1:20:34.046 --> 1:20:35.308
And killed all the priests

1:20:35.352 --> 1:20:37.615
and priestesses
that were involved.

1:20:37.658 --> 1:20:40.836
And buried in oblivion
and covered in silence,

1:20:40.879 --> 1:20:44.013
it was against the
law to talk about it.

1:20:44.056 --> 1:20:46.145
Buried in oblivion
and covered in silence

1:20:46.189 --> 1:20:48.147
the teachings of
the Great Mother.

1:20:48.191 --> 1:20:51.542
So of course my thing was
what are these teachings

1:20:51.585 --> 1:20:53.674
that had to be hush-hush.

1:20:56.155 --> 1:20:59.071
The basis of life
is transformation.

1:20:59.115 --> 1:21:02.858
Just as the seasons
change and just as we age

1:21:02.901 --> 1:21:06.339
and everything else is
happening constantly to us.

1:21:06.383 --> 1:21:09.908
And that's what it is. We
die and we fall to the earth

1:21:09.952 --> 1:21:11.388
and we are part of the earth

1:21:11.431 --> 1:21:14.870
that nurtures new life
and comes forward.

1:21:18.177 --> 1:21:20.832
I began to understand that
the issues I was having

1:21:20.876 --> 1:21:23.356
that I thought were mine alone

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:27.360
and that I was so fucked up
and that my family was this

1:21:27.404 --> 1:21:30.450
and that had an
historical basis.

1:21:30.494 --> 1:21:34.150
It is a bigger issue
than me, Olympia.

1:21:34.193 --> 1:21:36.021
You know, I began
to understand that

1:21:36.065 --> 1:21:37.849
I began to separate.

1:21:37.893 --> 1:21:42.245
Now this is my shit and this
is our species shit over here.

1:22:31.033 --> 1:22:33.731
It was my idea this thing of
going to my mother's village

1:22:33.774 --> 1:22:34.993
as you recall.

1:22:38.170 --> 1:22:42.174
It was something
matrilineal, for my daughter

1:22:42.218 --> 1:22:47.179
and my granddaughters to
come to my mother's village.

1:22:47.223 --> 1:22:48.659
And see, and feel

1:22:52.532 --> 1:22:55.753
a presence of my
mother and her mother.

1:22:57.189 --> 1:22:59.975
I have to say even
when I was young

1:23:00.018 --> 1:23:03.021
I had this connection
or something.

1:23:03.065 --> 1:23:08.026
Connection is almost too strong
and too practical somehow.

1:23:09.201 --> 1:23:12.161
It was more a kind of
a memory or a dream.

1:23:15.991 --> 1:23:17.731
And then I said to myself

1:23:17.775 --> 1:23:20.996
I wish I knew my
great grand parents

1:23:21.039 --> 1:23:22.736
and my great great
grand parents.

1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:26.175
And I thought, they
are in me some place.

1:23:28.046 --> 1:23:30.831
What if I just call them forth,

1:23:30.875 --> 1:23:33.573
what if I imagine
them what if I,

1:23:35.967 --> 1:23:39.275
assumed they're part
of my Soma, my DNA.

1:23:42.104 --> 1:23:44.019
I made them real to me.

1:23:45.759 --> 1:23:47.239
I saw their faces.

1:23:50.199 --> 1:23:52.940
I don't know why that
was so important to me.

1:23:52.984 --> 1:23:57.032
Because it stops, it
stops with my grand mother

1:23:57.075 --> 1:24:01.036
and you've got to know that
these people have been here

1:24:01.079 --> 1:24:04.039
for centuries,
millennia who knows.

1:24:05.214 --> 1:24:09.870
There's just something,
and I may never know it

1:24:09.914 --> 1:24:13.352
or understand it but
that doesn't matter.

1:24:14.571 --> 1:24:16.573
I feel like I said look.

1:24:19.228 --> 1:24:20.925
Here's this lineage.

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.929
Here's this long
red line you know.

1:24:26.148 --> 1:24:28.715
It's the menstruating red line.

1:24:29.934 --> 1:24:33.938
Here it is, this is part
of it. We're part of it,

1:24:35.853 --> 1:24:37.811
you're part of it.

1:26:03.027 --> 1:26:03.854
- Eleni.

1:26:06.161 --> 1:26:07.162
- Constanina

1:26:09.773 --> 1:26:11.122
Mine is Olympia.

1:26:23.352 --> 1:26:25.528
- Carrot, oh, it's delicious.

1:29:48.905 --> 1:29:51.473
- I think I'd like to sit back,

1:29:53.300 --> 1:29:55.215
I just feel like crying

1:30:10.274 --> 1:30:15.148
They reminded me of my mother,
they reminded me of my Yaya.

1:30:16.498 --> 1:30:18.282
You know what it was.

1:30:22.504 --> 1:30:24.767
I mean their hair
is all pulled back,

1:30:24.810 --> 1:30:26.464
they don't have a
lick of make up,

1:30:26.508 --> 1:30:30.120
half their teeth are gone
but they're beautiful.

1:30:30.163 --> 1:30:34.167
And they have such life
in them and such energy.

1:30:37.301 --> 1:30:40.478
Under different circumstances
we were similar ages

1:30:40.522 --> 1:30:42.915
we would have been filenadas.

1:30:42.959 --> 1:30:47.964
We would have been friends, we
would have grown up together.

1:30:54.971 --> 1:30:57.539
- Where
are we going now?

1:30:57.582 --> 1:30:59.889
- You want to just see
what happens to my face

1:30:59.932 --> 1:31:01.630
when I say the turtle.

1:31:04.981 --> 1:31:07.157
We're going to the turtle.

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:09.768
Now recovered after having been

1:31:13.555 --> 1:31:16.383
in the care of
nurses and doctors.

1:31:17.820 --> 1:31:20.083
It seems to have recovered
and is now ready to join

1:31:20.126 --> 1:31:23.303
it's fellow turtles
out in the Aegean.

1:31:35.664 --> 1:31:37.448
This is so beautiful.

1:31:43.410 --> 1:31:45.500
- So, about Lola

1:31:45.543 --> 1:31:48.285
the turtle we are
going to release today.

1:31:48.328 --> 1:31:50.983
- That's the name
of the turtle, Lola.

1:31:51.027 --> 1:31:53.508
Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.

1:31:56.554 --> 1:31:58.687
- So we
are about to start.

1:31:58.730 --> 1:32:00.993
Thank you very much
for being here.

1:32:01.037 --> 1:32:04.606
Please try not to be
loud in order to avoid

1:32:05.563 --> 1:32:07.304
stressing the animal.

1:32:10.437 --> 1:32:13.092
- I think we'll be
able to see from here.

1:32:13.136 --> 1:32:16.792
Oh, no all of the people
are going down there.

1:32:16.835 --> 1:32:19.098
I think we have to go down.

1:32:25.322 --> 1:32:27.716
It's enormous, it's enormous.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:25.600
What is happening right now?

1:33:25.643 --> 1:33:26.426
Are we looking?

1:33:26.470 --> 1:33:27.645
Are we sensing?

1:33:29.778 --> 1:33:31.040
It's evocative.

1:33:33.216 --> 1:33:35.261
Then you get that and you go on,

1:33:35.305 --> 1:33:38.613
then you keep going and then
continue to reach another point

1:33:38.656 --> 1:33:41.877
just like that turtle
trying to get to the ocean.

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:44.227
Or being compelled
to go to the ocean.

1:33:44.270 --> 1:33:48.100
It wasn't trying to do
anything that turtle.

1:33:48.144 --> 1:33:50.973
And you get another
hit, you stop.

1:34:03.812 --> 1:34:08.164
I realize I do the same
thing as that turtle does.

1:34:08.207 --> 1:34:10.383
And I do that when I work.

1:34:13.473 --> 1:34:17.652
I move and then I stop and
then my system seems to

1:34:18.653 --> 1:34:21.438
absorb in a
non-intellectual level.

1:34:22.352 --> 1:34:24.180
A non-emotional level.

1:34:25.355 --> 1:34:26.878
Is it my body?

1:34:26.922 --> 1:34:28.532
It is but it's not.

1:34:30.012 --> 1:34:33.189
I mean maybe it's a
non literal level.

1:34:37.193 --> 1:34:39.674
There she goes, there she goes.

1:36:47.976 --> 1:36:49.804
Well it's about time.

1:36:54.896 --> 1:36:56.201
It's about time.

1:37:01.250 --> 1:37:04.427
I'm freaking exhausted,
but I am free.

1:37:07.952 --> 1:37:10.520
Survived another piece of caca.

1:37:15.264 --> 1:37:16.700
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:37:19.703 --> 1:37:21.531
- They didn't kill me.

1:37:55.565 --> 1:37:59.438
- Remember mother would get up
and start doing these songs?

1:37:59.482 --> 1:38:02.615
I wanna get you on a
slow boat to China.

1:38:02.659 --> 1:38:04.182
Remember that one?

1:38:04.226 --> 1:38:06.358
And she would act it out.

1:38:10.493 --> 1:38:14.192
She said she was five
feet tall, she wasn't.

1:38:14.236 --> 1:38:15.367
She was 4'11.

1:38:16.934 --> 1:38:18.457
All right, we'll give it to her.

1:38:18.501 --> 1:38:20.677
Running around playing
all these parts.

1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:24.768
Well you don't know because
you were too young to remember.

1:38:24.811 --> 1:38:27.205
But I had to play the
spirit of young Greece

1:38:27.249 --> 1:38:32.036
in one of those things that
she and daddy put together.

1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:33.777
- She was in that dance group.

1:38:33.820 --> 1:38:37.912
- Right, the dance group and
all these 4'11 Greek ladies

1:38:37.955 --> 1:38:40.131
weighing 200 pounds
running round a diagonal.

1:38:40.175 --> 1:38:41.567
- I remember that.

1:38:41.611 --> 1:38:44.135
- Even at those ages
we knew it was funny

1:38:44.179 --> 1:38:46.921
and then I had to go over
and take these two doves

1:38:46.964 --> 1:38:49.227
out of a crate and release them

1:38:49.271 --> 1:38:52.143
as I was the spirit of hope
of the future for Greece.

1:38:52.187 --> 1:38:55.494
- And it turned out you
were the hope of Greece.

1:38:55.538 --> 1:38:57.627
- Then I took it
and I released them

1:38:57.670 --> 1:39:00.238
and the damn things
crapped all over me.

1:39:00.282 --> 1:39:01.587
I'll never forget that.

1:39:01.631 --> 1:39:02.937
- Oh, my god

1:39:02.980 --> 1:39:03.981
- Mom always said
I should've known

1:39:04.025 --> 1:39:05.243
what show business was like.

1:39:05.287 --> 1:39:06.505
That was the cue.

1:39:06.549 --> 1:39:08.768
The gods were
telling me something.

1:39:08.812 --> 1:39:10.988
"You are gonna get crapped on."
