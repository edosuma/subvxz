00:04.230 --> 00:05.996
Do you know a man named Ratovski?

00:06.007 --> 00:07.611
- He is dead.
- How is he dead?

00:07.622 --> 00:10.447
By my hand, so it is said.

00:10.458 --> 00:11.993
There's a belief in the community

00:12.004 --> 00:14.530
- that it's being haunted by a monster.
- Golem.

00:14.541 --> 00:16.383
You should save your
shock and awe for this.

00:16.394 --> 00:18.034
Those are bite marks, Reid.

00:18.045 --> 00:19.735
Flesh torn out with teeth.

00:19.746 --> 00:24.877
I could no more kill Leon
Ratovski than I could kill myself.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.498
Do you travel somewhere, Miss Castello?

00:29.509 --> 00:32.232
Paris, a story hunted down.

00:32.243 --> 00:35.765
Thomas Gower? This still does not
make Thomas Gower Tanner's killer.

00:35.776 --> 00:39.022
No, it does not. But it behoves
us to ask of him certain questions.

00:39.562 --> 00:41.006
Yaaagh!

00:41.496 --> 00:42.818
Ugh.

00:43.568 --> 00:46.549
What trouble brings you
here, young Mr. Dove?

00:46.550 --> 00:49.039
I've a worry which roots
itself in these parts.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.241
- Mr. Theakston?
- Yes, Miss S.?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.760
Will you take Connor for a few moments?

00:52.771 --> 00:53.649
Course, Miss S.

00:53.660 --> 00:56.569
It is you who gains access to
the Customs House, is it not?

00:56.580 --> 00:57.889
Might you show me?

00:57.890 --> 01:01.528
But there, beyond the
barricade, treasure.

01:18.141 --> 01:19.625
Look, the golem.

01:22.182 --> 01:23.382
What's that?

02:52.700 --> 02:53.970
Excuse me.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.141
Ahh! Police!

02:57.152 --> 02:58.968
Stop! There's someone there.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.190
What?

03:00.191 --> 03:01.689
- No!
- Yes! He's...

03:01.690 --> 03:03.519
he's covered in blood. He's dead.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.465
I do not say you did not see it.

03:10.476 --> 03:13.692
I only say that what
you saw, it was not real.

03:13.702 --> 03:15.603
It... it cannot be real.

03:15.614 --> 03:18.331
It was as real as you
are now, Bennet Drake.

03:18.342 --> 03:20.244
I don't know how many
times I need to say this.

03:20.255 --> 03:22.609
The woman is dead. I saw it myself.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.839
Her ankles are twitched, dead.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.168
Then how?

03:26.508 --> 03:28.430
How, Bennet?

03:28.441 --> 03:29.958
I am not mad!

03:30.230 --> 03:32.639
I am not that. I saw her.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.442
It is because you cannot rest.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.528
- You are sleepless.
- No.

03:36.990 --> 03:39.259
Rose, any woman would suffer so.

03:39.555 --> 03:43.029
Their senses adrift,
frayed through lack of rest.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.680
You must rest, Rose. Please.

03:46.691 --> 03:48.032
Uncle Bennet,

03:54.103 --> 03:56.592
perhaps this is not,
after all, the best time.

03:56.603 --> 04:00.430
No, child, this... this is good.
We are... we are glad you've come.

04:00.644 --> 04:02.193
Please, sit.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.604
It is Mathilda, my love,

04:07.200 --> 04:09.412
as we said, come to
watch the lad a while,

04:09.685 --> 04:11.772
give him some lunch and his tea, and...

04:13.002 --> 04:14.718
allow you some sleep.

04:15.740 --> 04:18.680
Allow those frayed senses
of yours to knit again.

04:19.646 --> 04:21.821
Only sleep, my love.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.483
All will be right again.

04:25.910 --> 04:30.268
And do not forget, Miss
Susan was your dear friend.

04:30.279 --> 04:34.259
And in your heart, you
must yet mourn for her.

04:35.978 --> 04:38.394
No, Bennet,

04:39.835 --> 04:41.942
she is no friend of mine.

04:42.105 --> 04:44.851
That bitch means to steal our child.

04:47.851 --> 04:49.980
Finished. Do you understand?

04:49.991 --> 04:51.760
Only for real this time.

04:51.778 --> 04:55.075
Our boy never clapping eyes
on us as long as he lives,

04:55.086 --> 04:56.899
unless it's a newspaper photograph,

04:56.910 --> 04:59.140
the pair of us with
ropes around our necks.

04:59.151 --> 05:00.799
What was I supposed to do, Matthew?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.576
He called to me, my
son. He called to me.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.960
Ought I to just have
abandoned him once more?

05:05.971 --> 05:08.361
You want to know what he's going
to look like when he's a grown man?

05:08.372 --> 05:10.811
Teach him to ride? Watch him
fall in love for the first time?

05:10.822 --> 05:12.682
You want to know those
things to pass? Then yeah,

05:12.693 --> 05:14.503
you God damn ought to
have left them there

05:14.514 --> 05:15.843
- to wail for you.
- Oh, you're a man.

05:15.854 --> 05:18.429
- You don't understand.
- Oh, that's a fine apology.

05:18.430 --> 05:21.425
Oh, I must apologise
now, must I? To you?

05:21.436 --> 05:23.746
Who I would otherwise consider
the bane of my life, if banes

05:23.757 --> 05:25.424
- weren't altogether more bearable!
- No, no, no. You are not

05:25.435 --> 05:27.228
going to deflect this on me.

05:27.239 --> 05:31.279
It's I that must go to my place
of work... a police station...

05:31.290 --> 05:34.009
and pray to God that my
chief's wife is not believed

05:34.020 --> 05:36.879
when she says she saw a
dead woman walk by her window

05:36.880 --> 05:38.197
- last night.
- Oh, she won't be.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.339
She was... she was barely
awake. She was sleepwalking.

05:40.350 --> 05:43.581
And besides, as you say, I am dead.

05:43.592 --> 05:45.176
Whoever would believer her? Hm?

05:45.187 --> 05:47.653
Well, we're soon going
to find out, won't we?

05:54.556 --> 05:56.403
Need my laboratory, don't I?

05:58.049 --> 05:59.820
Potassium nitrate,

06:01.049 --> 06:04.492
make this the lock-cracker for
your little escapade tonight.

06:04.812 --> 06:06.720
It mustn't happen tonight, must it?

06:08.757 --> 06:09.957
It must.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.440
You think you could sway Silver
Beard to that way of thinking?

06:18.130 --> 06:19.613
You leave Abel to me.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.542
If I'm not back by 10:00 tonight,
you just assume I'm taken.

06:28.151 --> 06:30.720
Make all further
arrangements without me.

06:31.230 --> 06:33.384
Only you make them fast. Do you hear me?

06:34.082 --> 06:35.737
And you get yourself gone.

06:44.283 --> 06:45.875
Bane of your life, huh?

07:02.160 --> 07:04.771
Oi, oi! Can I get a hand over here?

07:04.782 --> 07:06.458
In recognition

07:06.469 --> 07:11.747
of his outstanding achievement
in the reorganisation

07:11.758 --> 07:16.663
of the Metropolitan Police
Detective Department,

07:17.399 --> 07:19.637
Her Majesty the Queen,

07:20.065 --> 07:26.132
last night, bestowed the
Companion of the Order of the Bath

07:27.010 --> 07:31.840
to Assistant Commissioner Augustus Dove.

07:33.022 --> 07:35.035
This ceremony took place at Tornby Hall,

07:35.046 --> 07:36.971
where no less a personage
than Joseph Chamberlain,

07:36.982 --> 07:38.919
the Colonial Secretary,
conferred the honour.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.993
Oh, hold up, Drum.
It's the father-in-law.

07:41.706 --> 07:44.449
- Morning, Mr. Reid.
- Drummond. Thatcher.

07:44.450 --> 07:46.016
Morning, Mr. Reid.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.370
Hey, sir, did you see?

07:49.521 --> 07:52.763
Assistant Commissioner Dove
got a bauble for his coat.

07:52.774 --> 07:55.832
Do you disrespect this country's
heraldic traditions, Sergeant?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.045
Not me, Mr. Reid.

07:58.196 --> 08:03.699
Still, it's a wonder, is it not, where
a common fellow may rise to these days?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.470
Oh, you work hard, Thatcher,
who knows how far you may travel.

08:06.481 --> 08:08.621
Oh, I do not speak of myself, sir, no.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.992
Happy as he is, that's Frankie Thatcher.

08:11.003 --> 08:14.337
No, it's Drum here that I ask for.

08:14.348 --> 08:16.482
Indeed, and why might Sergeant Drummond

08:16.493 --> 08:18.649
thank you for inquiring
after his prospects?

08:18.660 --> 08:21.059
Oh, he's my friend is all.

08:21.060 --> 08:25.456
And I know how he means to be... uh...
to be well thought of in this world.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.679
Frank, enough.

08:27.680 --> 08:31.459
Oh, he is well thought of, Mr.
Thatcher. I can vouch for that.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.530
Leman Street.

08:42.216 --> 08:44.292
Body found of the back of Heneage.

08:45.270 --> 08:47.065
Mr. Reid, wait if you please!

08:47.234 --> 08:49.603
Men come. Rope the area
off as good as you can.

08:50.825 --> 08:54.099
The body, it is a dead
man, one known to us, sir.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.690
And who that, Mr. Drummond?

08:57.770 --> 08:59.751
Right, left...

09:03.198 --> 09:04.398
Drake.

09:05.532 --> 09:06.732
Jackson.

09:10.966 --> 09:12.166
Quiet night?

09:14.760 --> 09:16.190
Quiet enough.

09:17.719 --> 09:20.034
So the boy, he's settling on then?

09:21.420 --> 09:22.673
He does.

09:22.885 --> 09:27.667
Mr. Drake, a man's body is
found, murdered, so it's said.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.159
Who is it to attends?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.543
I feel we must.

09:31.951 --> 09:33.153
Who is it, Mr. Reid?

09:33.164 --> 09:35.584
- Captain, yourself also.
- Tell me who it is, Inspector!

09:35.595 --> 09:37.222
I am sorry, Bennet.

09:41.135 --> 09:43.686
Get out of the way. Move it!

09:44.899 --> 09:47.803
You men, I want these
ghouls 10 yards further back.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.563
Oh, Thomas,

09:54.914 --> 09:56.196
a street-fight.

09:57.337 --> 09:58.577
Knife wound.

10:01.022 --> 10:03.595
Gave as good as you got,
did you not, Thomas boy?

10:08.040 --> 10:11.089
Could have been over 200 pairs of
boots up and down here since sun-up.

10:11.090 --> 10:12.423
Any signs that may have been read

10:12.434 --> 10:14.587
would have been trod and
kicked into obscurity.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.531
He wasn't killed here, however.

10:23.150 --> 10:26.827
See his knees, grooves and
abrasions. And his hands likewise.

10:27.050 --> 10:28.646
It's gravel rash.

10:29.190 --> 10:32.303
He was... he was dragged.

10:32.314 --> 10:33.863
Dragged himself.

10:34.064 --> 10:37.018
Woodseer Orphanage is
three streets north of here.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.337
How?

10:39.074 --> 10:40.719
There is this violent altercation.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.353
The assailant takes the knife
to finish the matter, leaves him.

10:44.647 --> 10:46.957
So he crawls to where
he might feel safe.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.075
You let me through. Let me through.

10:50.086 --> 10:51.540
Let me through!

10:51.551 --> 10:53.054
Let me see him!

10:56.645 --> 10:58.162
- Oh!
- Deborah...

10:58.430 --> 11:01.201
Oh, who has done this to him?

11:01.212 --> 11:03.052
- Miss Goren, let us do our work.
- No!

11:03.063 --> 11:04.357
- Deborah...
- And what use

11:04.368 --> 11:06.787
is that work, Edmund
Reid? What use to us all?

11:06.798 --> 11:10.152
Please, please, let me walk you
home. You cannot help him now.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.655
Sergeant Drake, as you once
were, think of this boy.

11:13.666 --> 11:16.020
Think of all you have done for him!

11:17.990 --> 11:19.328
Come, come.

11:22.483 --> 11:25.225
Thatcher, remove this
hacker and her work.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.847
There's no law says you
may take that, Sergeant.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.878
Oh, is there not? Aw.

11:31.493 --> 11:33.121
Get you gone, woman.

11:33.671 --> 11:35.882
- Go!
- Ugh!

11:43.977 --> 11:47.697
The wound... how long for
him to bleed out, do we say?

11:48.055 --> 11:51.214
10 minutes, certainly no longer.

11:51.470 --> 11:52.787
And so injured,

11:52.993 --> 11:55.256
he could not have dragged
himself at no more than what?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.468
10 yards a minute, maybe.

12:00.676 --> 12:03.027
Miss Goren's orphanage, north of here.

12:04.509 --> 12:07.609
He must therefore come
from the other direction.

12:07.610 --> 12:09.215
- Thatcher...
- Yeah?

12:09.226 --> 12:13.765
I want a radius, 150
yards, all points south.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.018
Such a ruck...

12:15.029 --> 12:17.418
it would not took a place
on a main thoroughfare.

12:17.429 --> 12:20.334
We look for dark corners,
therefore, laneway dens,

12:20.491 --> 12:23.116
evil rookery yards. Get these men to it!

12:24.173 --> 12:26.193
All right, boys, I need
you to split three ways.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.282
Fan out, south and south-west.

12:28.293 --> 12:31.100
Ask yourself... any sign of
a ruck... we need to search.

12:33.174 --> 12:35.566
Some will say this is what killed him,

12:35.761 --> 12:38.663
this from which the ruin
of his life was made.

12:42.798 --> 12:45.074
This is the response, not the question.

12:47.919 --> 12:52.349
Edmund Reid, who sees life and
it's puzzles clearer than you?

12:52.792 --> 12:55.772
I have no idea what life would
look like were it not a puzzle.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.582
Were it not, I firmly believe the
two of us would never have met.

13:00.593 --> 13:01.793
No.

13:03.422 --> 13:06.287
Well, here is another puzzle for you.

13:06.298 --> 13:08.367
Why is it, do you suppose, in the...

13:09.035 --> 13:11.480
in the 2Â½ months since Isaac was hanged,

13:11.491 --> 13:14.408
you have not sat down to
take a drink with me once?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.321
Why do you think?

13:25.128 --> 13:27.237
I felt shame.

13:31.130 --> 13:33.363
Because you could not save Isaac?

13:41.568 --> 13:43.707
I wasn't going to show you these, but...

14:00.790 --> 14:04.706
These are drawings made
of this Whitechapel golem

14:04.717 --> 14:07.196
in the weeks before the
Rabbi Ratovski was murdered.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.700
No, they are the drawings
made in the past month.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.064
And what do you make
of that fact, Deborah?

14:19.195 --> 14:22.496
If they draw him still, perhaps
he lives still and did not die

14:22.507 --> 14:24.356
when Isaac Bloom was hanged.

14:24.367 --> 14:25.809
Might I borrow these?

14:31.743 --> 14:38.454
Edmund, there... there is a matter... I
feel it is, perhaps, disloyal to say it.

14:38.465 --> 14:40.184
But... but your daughter Mathilda...

14:40.195 --> 14:41.395
What of her?

14:41.406 --> 14:43.786
Her friendship with Miss Castello...

14:44.799 --> 14:47.057
Rachel is a good person. This I know.

14:47.068 --> 14:49.566
But she is young and angered.

14:49.576 --> 14:50.847
She feels...

14:50.858 --> 14:54.829
you police hide the truth of what is
acted out on the people of her faith.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.250
- She is Jewish?
- Raised as an English woman.

14:57.261 --> 15:01.802
However, she discovers
her heritage with a zeal,

15:01.813 --> 15:03.596
a zeal for truth,

15:03.908 --> 15:07.221
and that truth to be
discovered however it may,

15:08.027 --> 15:09.994
if you see my meaning.

15:12.486 --> 15:14.129
I do not know if it is disloyal.

15:14.140 --> 15:17.199
But I know that I am grateful
to you, the sharing of it.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.980
Whoa, hey. Hey!

16:08.800 --> 16:10.289
What happened?

16:11.363 --> 16:13.005
Blimey, what are they lookin' for?

16:18.740 --> 16:20.137
Here, you be Gower.

16:50.838 --> 16:52.417
Might be something.

16:52.790 --> 16:54.336
You are a newspaper woman.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.962
It is your job to inveigle, to
connive, to seduce. But this is low.

16:59.344 --> 17:00.551
She's a child.

17:00.562 --> 17:03.639
- She's my child.
- She is not that, Mr. Reid.

17:04.422 --> 17:07.699
I don't not know here well. But
what I do know of her, I admire.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.964
And she's no child, sir.

17:08.976 --> 17:11.944
And you think to turn
her to what? My betrayal?

17:11.955 --> 17:14.435
No, sir, never that.

17:15.522 --> 17:17.955
I seek only that which
you seek also, Mr. Reid,

17:17.967 --> 17:22.363
that which I find endlessly
injuncted from me, the truth.

17:27.926 --> 17:29.512
Wait. What is that?

17:29.784 --> 17:31.894
Is this the murdered man Ratovski?

17:32.890 --> 17:34.810
What is this? What is this mapping?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.489
What is it you make here?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.836
A history...

17:39.418 --> 17:42.563
of the frozen and famished
journeys made by those of my faith,

17:42.574 --> 17:44.114
that they might find
shelter in Whitechapel.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.913
Ratovski's journey amongst?

17:48.130 --> 17:50.314
Ratovski? What of him? Show me. Show me!

17:50.325 --> 17:51.929
No, sir, I will not.

17:51.930 --> 17:54.213
Bring a warrant if you must press it.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.834
A warrant.

17:57.059 --> 18:00.283
Or what details of the man and
his end which you yourself keep

18:00.294 --> 18:02.585
hidden from view in
the H-Division archives.

18:03.289 --> 18:07.856
I believe there is an expression
for the exchange, quid pro quo.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.018
See this?

18:14.029 --> 18:18.373
It's piercing of the spleen,
unstoppable internal bleeding.

18:19.323 --> 18:22.774
That was the finishing, but
not the finishing he sought.

18:22.785 --> 18:23.985
You don't mean it.

18:23.996 --> 18:26.132
All right, look at Gower's
pockets. There's money within.

18:26.143 --> 18:27.742
Therefore, it's not a theft.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.409
It is personal?

18:31.420 --> 18:33.567
His first point of attack from behind.

18:33.578 --> 18:35.337
Pinned against the wall.
He wished to knife him,

18:35.348 --> 18:37.150
he would have done it there and then.

18:46.957 --> 18:49.684
It is an easy thing to say, I know,

18:49.820 --> 18:52.879
but it is not you did this.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.197
It is not you put that knife in him.

18:56.994 --> 18:58.998
Nor you yourself, Mr. Reid.

19:00.438 --> 19:02.073
Oh God, no.

19:02.739 --> 19:04.468
- No, no, no, no!
- What?

19:15.388 --> 19:18.170
Hey, Drummond, I need you
to dig up a file for me.

19:21.287 --> 19:23.251
Last name, Ratovski.

19:24.399 --> 19:25.971
What is it you do?

19:27.176 --> 19:28.902
- Tell me!
- What do you think?

19:28.913 --> 19:32.032
This is a human bite mark.

19:40.368 --> 19:41.726
What?

19:42.880 --> 19:44.649
What do you mean, gone?

19:45.459 --> 19:50.136
Sergeant Drummond, beneath my desk,
calfskin briefcase. It is within.

19:52.289 --> 19:55.704
- Why is it you've kept it, Inspector?
- The case remains of interest.

19:55.715 --> 19:57.956
- Despite my instructions otherwise?
- What would you have me do, Bennet?

19:57.967 --> 20:00.426
- Avert my eyes?
- Exactly that, Mr. Reid.

20:00.951 --> 20:03.285
We had precise words on
that matter, did we not?

20:03.420 --> 20:07.463
And I was clear as to what such
disobedience might then incur.

20:22.091 --> 20:23.570
Get out, Drummond.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.369
Yes, Mr. Drake.

20:30.217 --> 20:32.914
They are not alike, Jackson. Not close!

20:33.050 --> 20:36.079
That's because those were
taken from the lower abdomen.

20:36.090 --> 20:38.516
It's fleshier there,
there's more to take.

20:39.080 --> 20:43.289
In both these examples,
the mandibular lower incisor

20:43.290 --> 20:45.948
is overlapped by the
maxillary central incisor.

20:45.959 --> 20:49.611
And now, the exact measurement
on each of them is a notch...

20:49.622 --> 20:53.833
and I mean a notch... under 250 thou.

20:53.844 --> 20:55.148
An overbite.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.741
A slight overbite.

20:58.237 --> 21:00.483
You throw a rock into
Commercial Street at lunchtime,

21:00.494 --> 21:02.332
and you will strike a man with the same.

21:02.343 --> 21:06.315
Further more, the method of attack on
this here is... it's entirely at odds.

21:06.326 --> 21:09.180
This is... this is a
street brawl, a knifing!

21:09.191 --> 21:10.391
Drake!

21:10.968 --> 21:13.442
Now, whatever this means to you,
it means the exact same to me.

21:13.453 --> 21:14.939
I made this case too.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.956
Now, how many examples of
pre and post-mortem biting

21:17.967 --> 21:20.527
have we had in the eight years
since I've served you here?

21:21.711 --> 21:22.911
No.

21:23.072 --> 21:26.944
Save this Ratovski,
and now your boy Gower.

21:27.624 --> 21:29.203
They see him still,

21:32.712 --> 21:36.591
who they used to call
the Whitechapel golem.

21:37.221 --> 21:40.881
These were drawn recently at
the orphanage in Woodseer Street.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.742
- Bennet...
- No.

21:58.185 --> 21:59.385
No.

22:01.094 --> 22:05.199
This man's killer has
been hanged for his crime.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.479
And these... children's
scrawlings and overbite...

22:08.490 --> 22:11.883
they are not evidence fit for
the overturning of that sentence.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.693
Now, I warned you, Mr. Reid.

22:17.734 --> 22:21.428
So you give me reason why I
ought not to send you away?

22:24.075 --> 22:28.812
This here now, I do not pursue it

22:29.519 --> 22:31.506
in some attempt to make the world wrong

22:31.517 --> 22:35.887
or to disprove your
work, his work, our work.

22:36.784 --> 22:40.083
I do it because I see the need for it.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.669
And yes, my return to Whitechapel was
indeed to make some defence of Isaac.

22:44.670 --> 22:51.168
But that I stayed it is you, Bennet
Drake, you my friend, who I missed.

22:52.106 --> 22:54.760
And who, now, I wish
nothing other than to help.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.236
And how is it you now help me?

22:57.247 --> 23:01.428
I want what you want. I want to
know who it was killed this boy.

23:03.230 --> 23:05.933
I want to see the investigation
I make bring you to him.

23:05.944 --> 23:07.847
I want to give Thomas Gower his justice,

23:07.858 --> 23:10.978
to use his awful death
to make comparison.

23:11.845 --> 23:14.154
Despite all that you say,
there are similarities

23:14.165 --> 23:16.035
with Ratovski's murder
that must at least

23:16.046 --> 23:18.533
be discarded before any
investigation could move forward.

23:18.544 --> 23:21.554
So you show me the case you
made against Bloom, Bennet.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.699
Show me, every step of the way.

23:25.662 --> 23:27.353
And then, either, you
will prove me wrong.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.123
In which case, you may
indeed send me away.

23:29.134 --> 23:33.559
Or we... you and I...
shall then together

23:33.570 --> 23:35.451
bring this killer to earth.

23:39.072 --> 23:40.810
Well, he has me sold.

23:57.147 --> 23:59.439
May I fetch you something, Mrs. Drake?

24:05.479 --> 24:07.189
Fetch me my boy.

24:09.408 --> 24:10.608
Hm.

24:11.124 --> 24:12.324
Hm.

24:15.636 --> 24:17.018
Come.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.890
Why are you here?

24:21.409 --> 24:24.167
My Uncle Bennett, your
husband, asked it of me,

24:24.346 --> 24:26.211
so you might rest, Mrs. Drake.

24:26.222 --> 24:31.663
No, girl, why are you in Whitechapel?

24:31.674 --> 24:34.277
And don't talk your riddles
with me and tell me you

24:34.288 --> 24:36.685
are here because your
father, Mr. Reid, is here.

24:36.696 --> 24:40.759
You tell me why the pair of you
would return to this place at all.

24:40.760 --> 24:42.329
It is our home.

24:42.846 --> 24:44.047
Home?

24:46.371 --> 24:52.396
A place where he knew
nothing but blood and despair?

24:52.750 --> 24:56.381
Where you were kept
prisoner by all them people?

24:56.933 --> 25:01.727
Your mother gone... dead
and mad for the loss of you?

25:03.406 --> 25:04.834
That's home, is it?

25:06.811 --> 25:10.389
Home chooses us, I believe,
and not the reverse.

25:11.731 --> 25:15.327
Tell me, will you marry
a copper also, Mathilda?

25:15.517 --> 25:18.703
I would say I'm too young
for marriage, Mrs. Drake.

25:19.275 --> 25:20.603
Too young?

25:20.994 --> 25:25.296
Shall I tell you all I had
lived by 19 years of age?

25:25.307 --> 25:27.984
I should be interested
to know, Mrs. Drake.

25:27.995 --> 25:30.555
But I am quite aware of
the needs and necessities

25:30.566 --> 25:33.375
which drive those of our
sex to the life you led

25:33.386 --> 25:35.471
before the music halls welcomed you.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.917
Are you though, Miss Reid?

25:41.047 --> 25:44.967
I do not think you are quite aware

25:45.840 --> 25:49.928
of what it is to have six men a night

25:49.939 --> 25:53.107
heave themselves into you
for the profit of another.

25:53.118 --> 25:57.487
And you and I both know whose
profit that was, do we not?

25:58.004 --> 25:59.859
You know who the mother i...

26:04.469 --> 26:05.958
Not mother.

26:06.558 --> 26:09.283
I am that. I am.

26:10.021 --> 26:12.306
You know who the maker
of Connor here is?

26:12.317 --> 26:14.033
It is Miss Susan.

26:14.595 --> 26:16.223
It is Miss Susan.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.281
It is her.

26:19.964 --> 26:23.082
She who might poison
the well of all London

26:23.093 --> 26:26.376
and find those who still
love and forgive her.

26:26.387 --> 26:28.153
Yourself, Mathilda,

26:28.648 --> 26:31.668
I'm sure you would be delighted

26:32.355 --> 26:38.039
to see her once more and pass
an hour or two in chat with her.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.975
It is true, I would.
But Miss Susan is dead.

26:40.986 --> 26:42.186
Hm.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.526
Miss Susan is dead.

26:44.537 --> 26:48.365
Long Susan Hart is dead.

26:48.376 --> 26:52.519
The whole world thought you
were dead and gone, Mathilda.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.032
And yet, there you stand.

26:56.430 --> 27:01.689
Connor, Connor, your mama is sorry.

27:02.478 --> 27:06.978
♪ In the pines, in the pines ♪

27:06.989 --> 27:10.814
♪ Where the sun don't ever shine. ♪

27:11.678 --> 27:14.273
Mathilda, he likes a pinch
of cinnamon in his milk.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.789
And we're now run dry of it.

27:16.186 --> 27:19.317
Will you take a penny from my
purse there and fetch him some?

27:19.328 --> 27:20.714
Of course, Mrs. Drake.

27:36.565 --> 27:40.394
When I was a girl and I wanted
my way, I would wheedle and whine,

27:42.724 --> 27:45.820
offer eternal devotion for a desire met,

27:46.152 --> 27:48.339
owe a thing for one denied.

27:50.664 --> 27:53.103
And you are now changed how?

27:55.480 --> 27:56.901
I do not whine.

27:56.912 --> 27:58.581
Small mercies.

27:58.892 --> 28:01.333
And a man as accustomed
to lying as you are

28:01.344 --> 28:04.639
would see clean through me as
soon as I made as if I hated you.

28:05.790 --> 28:08.432
Oh, but you have charm, my girl.

28:11.983 --> 28:16.012
And if we are to do this
thing, let us do it tonight.

28:17.701 --> 28:20.531
It is intemperate.

28:22.454 --> 28:23.848
It is bold.

28:23.961 --> 28:26.320
See you, Lady Macbeth.

28:27.508 --> 28:29.987
Thieve in haste, repent at leisure.

28:30.114 --> 28:32.234
Gather your Japanese
porcelain while you may.

28:38.181 --> 28:41.831
If it must indeed come
to pass that you leave us,

28:42.320 --> 28:45.439
I would see you steam away
from me on still waters.

28:45.450 --> 28:49.389
And this... plans must be
made, observations took.

28:49.390 --> 28:50.689
They are made.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.945
They are took, by myself.

28:54.220 --> 28:58.335
Because, Abel, the snare closes.

28:58.346 --> 29:00.938
Closes? How? I'll keep you safe here.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.429
It's only that I feel it.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.599
I feel it on me sharp.

29:05.345 --> 29:06.683
No.

29:07.536 --> 29:10.432
You are all together too
tough-minded for such suspicions.

29:10.443 --> 29:14.922
You tell me, girl... you
tell me how that snare looks?

29:19.535 --> 29:21.114
I have been seen.

29:25.655 --> 29:26.904
Oh!

29:27.160 --> 29:31.390
Does she say, thank you,
Matthew, for saving my life?

29:31.815 --> 29:33.142
Well done?

29:34.127 --> 29:35.327
Nope.

29:36.746 --> 29:39.168
Take me to see my boy.

29:39.855 --> 29:43.239
Now, I told you that was a bad idea.

29:43.585 --> 29:45.031
And did you listen?

29:45.241 --> 29:46.441
No.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.081
And whose problem is it now?

29:48.092 --> 29:51.562
That's right, Old Jackson.

29:52.928 --> 29:54.860
And I'm the one that
goes off half-cocked.

29:54.871 --> 29:57.446
I'm the one that doesn't
think things through.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.598
Shit! Idiot!

30:19.990 --> 30:21.777
This how she did it then?

30:22.569 --> 30:25.441
What did she promise you,
Guard Theakston, money?

30:25.452 --> 30:27.361
For delivery to that pit?

30:27.372 --> 30:28.679
A kind word?

30:28.690 --> 30:30.121
Her snake tongue in your ear?

30:30.132 --> 30:31.789
Who is it you speak of?

30:31.790 --> 30:33.628
I don't even know who you are.

30:33.639 --> 30:34.939
Oh, do you not?

30:35.520 --> 30:37.303
What about the boy then?

30:37.494 --> 30:38.906
Remember him?

30:40.584 --> 30:42.532
That's Miss Susan's boy.

30:42.948 --> 30:46.938
And you would let him believe
she is dead when she is not.

30:47.734 --> 30:50.347
How did she climb down
from that scaffold, eh?

30:50.358 --> 30:52.013
How did she do that?

30:52.351 --> 30:55.989
Think I will not see you corrected
for this if you do not tell?

30:58.184 --> 31:01.064
My husband, this boy's new father,

31:01.075 --> 31:03.395
he is the police headman at Whitechapel.

31:03.406 --> 31:06.501
And he will see you
swing, just as surely as he

31:06.512 --> 31:08.212
will her when he catches her.

31:08.472 --> 31:10.021
How did she do it?

31:10.340 --> 31:12.141
Where is she hid, eh?

31:12.152 --> 31:13.541
Who hides her?

31:18.209 --> 31:21.776
I see you, your fear.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.916
You tell me.

31:24.392 --> 31:25.707
You're mad, woman.

31:25.718 --> 31:27.720
- You're all the same.
- Ugh.

31:31.092 --> 31:32.527
Come on, Connor.

31:39.841 --> 31:42.031
This is where we found Ratovski,

31:45.294 --> 31:46.649
here.

31:46.975 --> 31:48.975
Boy found him, raised a uniform.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.639
You were able to keep the scene intact?

31:51.640 --> 31:55.901
It was chaos by the time I got
here, packed tight, screaming.

31:55.912 --> 31:57.634
Folk could see what
had been done to him.

31:57.645 --> 32:00.286
Head caved in, shirt
ripped from him, and...

32:00.359 --> 32:02.735
those bites taken out of his body.

32:03.525 --> 32:05.358
Word would've got about, I imagine,

32:05.369 --> 32:07.217
chimed most likely with the... uh...

32:07.313 --> 32:09.885
the talk that had grown up
of this Whitechapel golem.

32:09.896 --> 32:12.370
Although, there is no golem myth
in which it is said to have torn

32:12.381 --> 32:14.944
- men's flesh from their bodies.
- Whatever the myth of it, Mr. Reid,

32:14.955 --> 32:18.412
we saw that any confirmation of
that fact be withheld from the press.

32:18.423 --> 32:19.733
And why that?

32:19.744 --> 32:21.575
I was worried at what those with

32:21.586 --> 32:24.142
a fear of our Jewish
neighbours might accuse them of.

32:24.153 --> 32:26.736
- I felt it a wise policy.
- And one that you continued once

32:26.747 --> 32:28.437
- Isaac Bloom was...
- Once he, a Jewish man,

32:28.448 --> 32:30.234
was sentenced for it, yes.

32:30.245 --> 32:32.644
So then, you removed the body?

32:32.655 --> 32:33.855
We did.

32:34.221 --> 32:35.680
Identification?

32:35.691 --> 32:38.320
The man's university
accreditation was found about him.

32:38.321 --> 32:40.179
You'd wired his place of work?

32:40.180 --> 32:42.767
He'd taken a week's leave,
not told a soul for why.

32:42.778 --> 32:44.099
And then, door-to-door?

32:44.786 --> 32:46.730
The synagogue on Princelet Street.

32:46.741 --> 32:48.049
Max Steiner.

32:48.577 --> 32:53.020
Ratovski paid his respects,
made a few prayers,

32:53.031 --> 32:55.610
and offered nothing of
his purpose, and left.

32:55.621 --> 32:57.681
Then, we go to Bloom's lodgings next.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.168
An old lock-seller, a lady,

33:06.179 --> 33:10.665
said she saw Ratovski arrive at
Blooms around 6:00 of the evening.

33:10.676 --> 33:12.049
Saw him leave an hour later.

33:12.060 --> 33:13.522
His body found...

33:13.901 --> 33:15.320
The next morning.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.271
But killed, according to
Jackson, 11:00 of the night.

33:18.282 --> 33:21.480
Then you interviewed Bloom. You
found him disturbed, I imagine.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.388
More bewildered at the first.

33:23.399 --> 33:27.417
He could not recall Ratovski's
visit nor even that the man existed.

33:27.524 --> 33:29.450
And you did not search his room then?

33:29.710 --> 33:31.419
I had no call to.

33:32.089 --> 33:35.710
It was not as though I did not
remember the man fondly, Mr. Reid.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.329
I felt sad for him, not suspicious.

33:39.330 --> 33:41.803
So it was not until you had Rabbi
Steiner's account of him being attacked

33:41.814 --> 33:44.104
- by Bloom that you returned.
- Another violent attack

33:44.115 --> 33:45.155
on a religious man.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.556
Compelling indicator that
warranted further pursuit.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.046
A search warrant was requested.

33:49.057 --> 33:52.763
We returned to Bloom's lodgings
here, conducted our search,

33:52.774 --> 33:54.863
found that plug of flesh, that shirt.

33:56.246 --> 33:57.917
[Yelling in Hebrew]

33:57.928 --> 33:59.615
- [Yelling in Hebrew]
- Calm yourself, sir, I beg you.

33:59.626 --> 34:00.959
- Calm yourself.
- Police!

34:00.970 --> 34:02.319
We mean you no harm.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.734
Our apologies.

34:04.915 --> 34:06.115
We will leave you.

34:21.436 --> 34:23.264
Briggs, here, take a shift.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.065
Tell me, what is it?

34:28.077 --> 34:29.637
Is my Uncle Bennet here? My father?

34:29.648 --> 34:31.933
Neither, Tilda. What is it that
worries you? What do you say?

34:31.944 --> 34:34.610
I think I must not, Drum.
Might I wait, however?

34:38.139 --> 34:42.203
Do I wait, then, for you to show me
what it is I have neglected to see?

34:42.214 --> 34:43.860
No, 'tis copper fastened, Bennet.

34:43.871 --> 34:46.458
I would have come to the same
conclusions. I do not contest that.

34:46.469 --> 34:50.458
Perhaps, I worry it is, ah, too
much of an irreproachable case.

34:50.801 --> 34:53.559
We here cannot win but
for one fault or another.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.963
But do you not agree?

34:55.848 --> 34:59.179
In his bewilderment, you
have found a perfect suspect?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.761
In that search, the
unimprovable evidence?

35:01.772 --> 35:03.661
Does such ease... given
what we've seen today...

35:03.672 --> 35:06.610
not raised the slightest
shiver of suspicion for you?

35:06.621 --> 35:09.539
And is that not you all over, Mr. Reid?

35:09.550 --> 35:13.139
Your fevered eyes once more
burning through the deceit

35:13.150 --> 35:15.919
of the world, in the hope
that you might, at last,

35:15.920 --> 35:17.710
uncover its black mechanics.

35:17.721 --> 35:20.389
And there, perhaps, is the
difference between you and I.

35:20.614 --> 35:23.715
I chose this work because I
believe... in my dull simplicity...

35:23.726 --> 35:26.832
that the inequities of
this life might be checked.

35:26.843 --> 35:29.410
But you... well, I've come to
believe that you choose them

35:29.421 --> 35:31.349
in the hope that they may never cease.

35:31.350 --> 35:33.409
For what then, Edmund Reid?

35:33.410 --> 35:36.508
What then for that
restless soul of yours?

35:57.461 --> 36:00.117
See the wound to his
side? The bite marks?

36:00.128 --> 36:02.803
All the signs of the golem. You see?

36:03.680 --> 36:07.309
Don't you see what has been
done to him, sir? To his flesh?

36:07.320 --> 36:11.337
Sir, Inspector Drake.
Sir! Inspector Drake!

36:11.348 --> 36:13.884
Will you not tell me what
our eyes now see here?

36:13.895 --> 36:15.921
What has been done to this man?

36:16.250 --> 36:18.579
Or will you hide the
facts of this case too?

36:18.580 --> 36:20.059
- Come on, come on.
- No!

36:20.060 --> 36:21.305
No.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.673
I wonder if you understand,

36:51.060 --> 36:53.141
if you could imagine even what it is

36:53.152 --> 36:55.409
so many in our community
have suffered to...

36:55.410 --> 36:58.901
- If you will, please...
- I will not, Inspector Drake!

36:58.912 --> 37:03.248
They do not walk, starving,
through the frozen steps of Europe

37:03.259 --> 37:05.792
to arrive here to be so savaged

37:05.951 --> 37:10.396
just when they imagine they...
have some salvation near at hand.

37:11.117 --> 37:13.682
You are charged with the
peoples protection, sir.

37:13.693 --> 37:16.269
And you have failed in that mandate!

37:16.870 --> 37:20.783
And you, Mr. Reid, how
will you remedy this?

37:24.181 --> 37:25.992
I will ask you of this man.

37:26.230 --> 37:27.985
Will you tell me his name?

37:28.570 --> 37:30.468
His name is Nadelman.

37:30.929 --> 37:33.362
More than that, I can't tell you.

37:33.863 --> 37:36.609
He recently came here from Lithuania,

37:36.610 --> 37:41.148
as you can see, emaciated
from his deprivations.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.349
But we cared for him.

37:44.140 --> 37:46.408
We gave him a room
beneath the synagogue.

37:46.419 --> 37:48.988
- And that is where you found him, sir?
- It was.

38:00.523 --> 38:04.055
Mr. Thatcher, you will escort Rabbi
Steiner back to Princelet Street.

38:04.066 --> 38:06.729
Take men. And you will work the
room as you have been taught.

38:06.730 --> 38:10.389
Rabbi Steiner, we will see these streets
now scoured for the cause of this.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.705
You have my word. We will
not rest till it is done.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.280
Bennet... Bennet!

38:26.291 --> 38:28.047
What?! What?

38:28.148 --> 38:30.194
Do you try to tell me
the old man is wrong?

38:30.205 --> 38:31.634
Do you?

38:31.645 --> 38:35.627
That this is not at my door?
This Nadelman? Thomas Gower.

38:35.630 --> 38:39.995
- Isaac Bloom, innocent and hanged.
- You are not their killer.

38:40.006 --> 38:41.319
You are not.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.649
This is a battle worth
of blood, remember?

38:43.650 --> 38:45.136
This is not a battle. This is defeat.

38:45.147 --> 38:47.707
Oh, so the abyss will
swallow Bennet Drake, will it?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.269
It swallowed you once, if you remember.

38:56.048 --> 38:59.630
Our Gower was a soldier with the
strength to resist this... uh...

39:00.714 --> 39:05.682
fetish with the body. But this
man... no, you can see how weak he is.

39:05.693 --> 39:08.109
Advanced malnutrition,
severe muscle waste.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.879
There's necrosis of the fat cells.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.659
You can approximate a time of death?

39:11.660 --> 39:13.869
Are you asking if it was
about the same time as Gower's?

39:13.870 --> 39:15.712
Yeah, I'd say it was approximate, Reid.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.546
30th, September, 1888.

39:20.496 --> 39:22.432
- The double event.
- Mm.

39:22.615 --> 39:25.114
Catherine Eddowes' body found
three quarters of an hour

39:25.125 --> 39:26.955
after that of Elizabeth Stride.

39:28.020 --> 39:31.602
Whether he was interrupted or
she did not serve his needs,

39:32.072 --> 39:35.290
the Ripper was unable to do
what he wished with Miss Stride.

39:35.301 --> 39:37.909
And so, glutted himself on Miss Eddowes.

39:37.910 --> 39:40.427
But here, our killer here...

39:40.438 --> 39:44.389
he finds himself face-to-face with
Thomas's strength and resistance.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.909
It takes a knife to end that resistance.

39:46.920 --> 39:50.524
Then, he flees from the
rumpus he has no doubt made,

39:50.800 --> 39:53.850
makes his way towards the refugee
lodgings in Princelet Street...

39:54.030 --> 39:59.324
Finds a man too broken to fight,
let's his desires grow fierce.

39:59.335 --> 40:01.787
Now, come see. Take a look here.

40:02.096 --> 40:06.249
These are parallel tracks where the
upper incisors scraped down the skin.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.965
And these are static puncture
marks where he then gouges

40:08.976 --> 40:10.243
down onto the lower teeth.

40:10.254 --> 40:12.089
And then, the flesh is torn and sheared.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.429
So it's almost as if he's
shaking them with his teeth.

40:14.430 --> 40:16.486
So this biting... it presents itself

40:16.497 --> 40:20.819
less as cannibalism and more
of a... a means of attack.

40:20.820 --> 40:23.085
- It's like an animal.
- Like a dog attacks?

40:23.096 --> 40:25.651
Like a dog. It's alike.

40:27.294 --> 40:30.603
And this is the animal hair that
I took from where Gower was found.

40:32.929 --> 40:36.696
From the scale pattern of the
cuticle and the medulla type,

40:36.707 --> 40:39.269
it's from an animal that
is very much like a dog.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.906
It's a timber wolf.

40:41.219 --> 40:44.904
Now, this town is crazy, I grant
you. But the last time I checked,

40:46.838 --> 40:48.879
there were no wolves in Whitechapel.

41:04.052 --> 41:05.252
Yes?

41:07.209 --> 41:08.773
Yes, that's understood.

41:10.163 --> 41:12.754
Assistant Commissioner Dove is here.

41:14.206 --> 41:16.201
The error of it, sir.

41:16.606 --> 41:18.978
The sheer bloody muck of the mistake.

41:19.304 --> 41:21.198
Not for the minding of, Inspector,

41:21.209 --> 41:25.090
not now. Not yet.

41:32.470 --> 41:37.708
I know you, the man you
are, the policeman you are.

41:37.885 --> 41:39.836
Compassion and rigour
you brought to that case,

41:39.847 --> 41:42.236
as to every other
part of your work here.

41:43.035 --> 41:45.010
You could never be questioned.

41:45.579 --> 41:48.229
It must be brought once more, Mr. Drake.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.353
This killer must be trapped.

41:52.288 --> 41:54.529
I know you understand this, sir.

41:55.717 --> 41:58.169
You shall have all the
resources you require.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.857
Thank you, sir.

42:01.740 --> 42:04.836
And I expect updates on the hour.

42:04.847 --> 42:07.160
- You shall have them, Mr. Dove.
- Mr. Reid.

42:10.092 --> 42:12.841
You find this savage beast, Inspector.

42:13.025 --> 42:14.277
I will, sir.

42:18.245 --> 42:19.925
Good evening, Mrs. Drake.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.638
Hello to you, young man.

42:24.277 --> 42:26.639
I'm sure Mr. Dove is
pleased to see you, as I am.

42:26.640 --> 42:28.857
But it is late for the
lad to be out and about.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.981
Rose, he is freezing.

42:35.476 --> 42:38.301
Never mind, Connor. Better you mind me.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.899
Not Now, woman. Not here.

42:40.910 --> 42:44.547
- Mr. Drake, I should...
- No, Augustus, you will here this.

42:44.661 --> 42:46.280
- Rose...
- I have no secrets.

42:46.291 --> 42:50.179
And best you know how it is a
murderess escaped her sentence.

42:50.180 --> 42:52.869
I know how she did it. I know.

42:53.170 --> 42:55.399
- I have discovered it.
- Rose, I have told you,

42:55.410 --> 42:57.761
- this is a madness.
- It is not, Bennett!

42:58.392 --> 43:00.769
See, I went to Newgate,
to the pit there.

43:00.770 --> 43:03.689
And there is a guard,
name of Theakston Hull.

43:03.690 --> 43:06.001
How he used to make eyes at Long Susan.

43:06.187 --> 43:07.797
Mrs. this, Mrs. that...

43:07.808 --> 43:10.470
he'd have cleaned her ass with
his tongue had she asked for it.

43:10.481 --> 43:12.431
- Rose, enough!
- No, I stopped him.

43:12.443 --> 43:13.910
And I asked him.

43:13.911 --> 43:17.998
I said, how'd she done it? Tell
us. Tell us where she hides.

43:18.260 --> 43:21.799
And you should have seen it.
White as the beard of God.

43:21.810 --> 43:24.273
And I knew it. I knew it then.

43:24.418 --> 43:27.868
She must have been put in
that Newgate pit still alive

43:27.879 --> 43:30.809
and some accomplice to
come and collect her.

43:30.820 --> 43:33.162
- You cannot think...
- You think I'm not able?

43:33.876 --> 43:37.041
Just remember all that she has done.

43:37.563 --> 43:42.900
55 man, woman, child... and
not a soul in this square mile

43:42.911 --> 43:45.341
whose live's not changed by her,

43:46.157 --> 43:47.836
by Long Susan Hart.

43:47.847 --> 43:49.942
And she is about her evil once more.

43:49.953 --> 43:51.468
- You will stop this now!
- Oh, just

43:51.479 --> 43:54.128
try and make me, Bennet Drake!

43:55.081 --> 43:58.188
Say you love me, do
you? Well, you cannot.

43:59.231 --> 44:01.953
Because you do not trust me.

44:02.150 --> 44:06.960
I, who have trusted you
and had faith in you,

44:06.971 --> 44:09.535
when I know the black
things you have done.

44:09.546 --> 44:11.895
- You will be silent.
- I will not!

44:15.005 --> 44:21.084
Reid, Susan, the captain, all
of you, the things you have done.

44:21.095 --> 44:24.735
And I have kept that secret
like a poison in my heart.

44:24.746 --> 44:26.849
- Rose!
- Enough!

44:29.166 --> 44:31.493
You two stop this right now.

44:31.761 --> 44:33.158
Have a care.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.932
Let me take him home then.

45:02.276 --> 45:04.474
We must take him home now, love.

45:06.459 --> 45:07.687
Come on.

45:09.181 --> 45:10.555
Let us go home.

45:16.950 --> 45:18.629
Did you hear her accusations?

45:18.630 --> 45:20.389
I couldn't fail to, could I, Frank?

45:20.390 --> 45:23.476
- And so, what do you say?
- I say they are best unheard.

45:31.494 --> 45:35.469
I'll tell you what, Miss Reid,
he's a lickspittle, this one.

45:35.550 --> 45:39.176
And you, Frank Thatcher, have an
old woman's snatch box for gossip.

45:42.065 --> 45:45.940
If you do not mind, Mathilda, I should
like a word with Sergeant Drummond.

45:47.368 --> 45:49.840
Yes, sir. Here, sir?

45:49.841 --> 45:51.466
No, Public House, I think.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.967
Thatcher, you may stand
at dock until he returns.

45:56.978 --> 45:59.882
You might be a little warier
with my daughter, however.

46:01.246 --> 46:02.766
After you, Drummond.

46:21.859 --> 46:23.702
It's still too God damn wet.

46:23.713 --> 46:25.068
Have to serve.

46:45.524 --> 46:49.521
You should know, Mr.
Reid, that your Mathilda...

46:49.830 --> 46:53.149
uh, I mean to say, if it please
you, t-that y-you ought not

46:53.150 --> 46:57.170
to be afraid of any impropriety
or... or ugly motive on my part.

46:57.181 --> 47:01.066
I seek only to... if
such were permitted,

47:01.077 --> 47:03.243
both by yourself a-and
herself, of course...

47:03.254 --> 47:05.741
I... I seek only to be allowed to
come to know her a little better

47:05.752 --> 47:07.129
- and...
- Drummond...

47:07.130 --> 47:08.464
Yes, Mr. Reid?

47:10.688 --> 47:14.992
Six months back, when
Captain Jackson removed

47:15.003 --> 47:18.612
the bloody imprint of
Isaac Bloom's fingerprints

47:18.623 --> 47:21.710
from the shirt placard of
the murdered Rabbi Ratovski

47:21.721 --> 47:24.699
and Inspector Drake wished them
then to be used as evidence...

47:24.700 --> 47:26.868
- you recall all this?
- I do.

47:26.887 --> 47:31.538
And the warrant was then secured
for the search of Mr. Bloom's rooms.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.799
Yes, sir.

47:32.810 --> 47:36.538
And when it was felt that
the full and awful details

47:36.549 --> 47:39.119
of the crime should not be
broadcast abroad for fear

47:39.120 --> 47:43.379
of panic and so the newspapers
were injuncted, all this you recall?

47:43.380 --> 47:44.809
Well, who could forget, Mr. Reid?

47:44.820 --> 47:50.000
Then, tell me, whose authority
was it saw all these commands made?

47:50.117 --> 47:52.899
Why, Mr. Dove, sir.

48:05.028 --> 48:06.769
Good evening, Augustus.

48:06.770 --> 48:08.982
You have heard the rumpus out there?

48:09.528 --> 48:11.647
I have not, forgive me.

48:11.807 --> 48:13.477
This has been a day.

48:14.138 --> 48:18.285
Well, it must've been, for
the whole world cries of it.

48:18.505 --> 48:19.974
Of what?

48:20.340 --> 48:22.601
Not the once, but twicer.

48:25.451 --> 48:30.253
He has performed his act once more.

48:35.970 --> 48:42.378
Ah, the last occasion he confessed to
both of us what he'd done to that rabbi.

48:43.414 --> 48:46.809
Oh, I remember, Abel.
What a run-around that was.

48:49.906 --> 48:51.701
You were meant to care for him.

48:51.712 --> 48:53.327
And I do. I do!

48:53.338 --> 48:56.055
This cannot happen
again. He must be watched.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.284
Ah, I know. I know.

49:01.009 --> 49:04.766
And further to that, Abel,
the woman you shelter,

49:05.962 --> 49:07.787
I now know who she is.

49:09.123 --> 49:11.042
Why would you not tell me?

49:11.290 --> 49:13.575
She is almost a
celebrity in these parts.

49:13.586 --> 49:16.091
And you have kept her these two months.

49:16.360 --> 49:20.285
I have grown fond of her, wish her well.

49:20.296 --> 49:23.994
Your murderous conniving
mind, by your kind heart,

49:24.860 --> 49:26.866
it will be the finishing of ya.

49:26.992 --> 49:29.333
Hm, I do not think it is the end

49:29.344 --> 49:31.420
of myself which currently exercises

49:31.431 --> 49:33.583
you, Assistant Commissioner.

49:33.743 --> 49:36.910
You and that bauble so
recently pinned to your breast.

49:37.010 --> 49:39.742
And besides, they owe me money.

49:39.753 --> 49:42.406
- She and her American husband?
- Oh, yeah.

49:43.340 --> 49:44.955
How did he do it?

49:45.443 --> 49:48.418
How did he fake her
death, Abel? Free her?

49:48.609 --> 49:51.995
Oh, damned if I know.
But he is a sharp one.

49:53.478 --> 50:00.249
Plus, there are plans afoot, which
will see the pair of them gone.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.440
- Plans?
- Hm.

50:02.441 --> 50:05.059
There is currently some
merit in H-Division's finest

50:05.060 --> 50:06.855
surgeon being gone from it.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.205
You set about your plan, Abel.

50:09.216 --> 50:12.129
I shall set about seeing how
else the trail that leads to us

50:12.130 --> 50:13.423
may be broke and scattered.

50:13.434 --> 50:15.678
How that, Augustus? How
broke? How scattered?

50:15.689 --> 50:18.777
Never mind that for now. You get home.

50:19.006 --> 50:21.964
And you keep that beast
close to you, you understand?

50:43.810 --> 50:45.684
Matthew, I was afraid.

50:46.505 --> 50:48.059
Me and you both, Darling.

50:48.417 --> 50:52.751
I tell ya, this town, the things
that I've seen within it today...

50:52.762 --> 50:54.260
me and you've got to
get this thing finished

50:54.271 --> 50:56.636
and ourselves done with
this place for all time.

50:57.902 --> 50:59.177
Where is the sea-dog?

50:59.188 --> 51:00.607
He's called away.

51:01.509 --> 51:03.504
And the retarded first-mate?

51:03.763 --> 51:05.099
Sleeping beyond.

51:13.254 --> 51:15.428
I know there's wisdom in
sleeping on it for night work.

51:15.439 --> 51:17.916
But it's time to rise
and get about it now, son.

51:27.920 --> 51:32.759
Well, my children, the
night is a dark one.

51:33.125 --> 51:35.164
Clouds roll over.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.414
Such auguries must not be ignored.

51:41.710 --> 51:43.699
Let us eat before we thieve.

51:58.630 --> 51:59.905
Move across.

52:02.570 --> 52:04.040
I sit there.

52:08.816 --> 52:10.789
Go, Nate. Move along.

52:11.570 --> 52:14.328
Who are we to separate husband and wife?

52:16.837 --> 52:21.580
Ah, while you're up, get them
kerosene lamps and wipe them down.

52:31.770 --> 52:34.339
There is food aplenty, Captain.

52:34.462 --> 52:36.959
No call for you to be filching others.

52:42.481 --> 52:43.681
Sleep.

52:46.650 --> 52:48.342
Forget about this world awhile.

53:00.423 --> 53:02.967
Were there naught to be
done, I would stay, Rose.

53:04.340 --> 53:10.194
But... uh... tonight there is
an evil out there, which I...

53:12.534 --> 53:15.192
I cannot hide at home, my love.

53:17.051 --> 53:19.794
And for all of it may not be
worth a heap of shit no more....

53:21.873 --> 53:23.379
I must go to work.

53:29.712 --> 53:30.912
Bennet...

53:32.666 --> 53:33.970
Yes, my love?

53:38.508 --> 53:39.920
Do what you like.

54:21.210 --> 54:22.949
As we have agreed, your building

54:22.950 --> 54:26.674
of the case... the evidence
which convicted Mr. Bloom,

54:27.003 --> 54:29.633
it was flawless.

54:33.958 --> 54:38.250
But we know that Isaac Bloom cannot
have killed Ratovski, because...

54:38.251 --> 54:40.481
- The killer still walks amongst us.
- Yes.

54:42.178 --> 54:45.865
Now, we must needs look
elsewhere for the flaw, Bennet.

54:45.866 --> 54:49.571
And so, I only ask you
to think on who else

54:49.582 --> 54:53.544
might have had both the
knowledge and the opportunity.

54:59.171 --> 55:00.371
What?

55:06.270 --> 55:10.980
My division has known care and
advancement beneath his eye.

55:11.985 --> 55:14.010
He has been the voice and encouragement

55:14.021 --> 55:16.973
we who must police this
quarter have always called for.

55:17.844 --> 55:21.889
He has understood my life here,
Mr. Reid. He has been my friend.

55:21.890 --> 55:24.587
And it is he who gets you your warrant.

55:24.900 --> 55:29.278
He who, therefore, knows the address
at which to leave the evidence,

55:29.700 --> 55:33.601
evidence that he knew Captain Jackson
would clasp tight to his heart.

55:33.612 --> 55:37.650
And it is he who then says,
yes! Use your fingerprints.

55:37.661 --> 55:42.109
And yes! I will bar all newspaper
reportings of the details.

55:45.209 --> 55:48.611
Only he, Bennet.

55:49.720 --> 55:52.671
Only Augustus Dove.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.918
You ask me to admit his corruption.

55:58.201 --> 56:00.259
I must therefore admit my own.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.241
I see that. I see that, Bennet, I do.

56:02.252 --> 56:08.135
But what purchase that support
and advancement has given him here.

56:08.829 --> 56:10.459
- My purchase, you mean?
- No...

56:10.460 --> 56:13.632
- My seduction?! No, Mr. Reid!
- No, I do not mean to say...

56:15.290 --> 56:18.259
Now, I may now need you here
for this fight which comes down.

56:18.260 --> 56:21.278
But you leave of
Augustus Dove. You hear?

56:30.073 --> 56:36.636
Rose... Rose, it is only me.

56:50.204 --> 56:51.746
Rose, forgive me.

56:52.218 --> 56:53.624
Will you let me in?

56:57.165 --> 56:59.946
Would you not come to
curse me for my madness?

57:02.377 --> 57:04.846
Why would I? I know you're sane.

57:11.045 --> 57:12.896
Do you believe me?

57:13.793 --> 57:15.178
I do, Rose.

57:15.704 --> 57:17.183
Oh!

57:17.470 --> 57:19.807
Why, that is a wonderful thing!

57:20.670 --> 57:23.561
Thank you. Augustus, thank you.

57:26.596 --> 57:29.761
Will you keep watch over us?

57:29.980 --> 57:33.773
If Mr. Drake is not here
to do so, then I shall.

57:35.410 --> 57:39.779
The thought of you doing so,
currently makes me happier.

57:40.638 --> 57:41.910
However...

57:50.013 --> 57:52.778
There was another fear
that you spoke of earlier,

57:53.290 --> 57:55.172
on the subject of Miss Hart.

57:57.876 --> 58:00.620
But also, Mr. Reid.

58:01.980 --> 58:05.258
An act in which you believe
them to have collaborated.

58:08.788 --> 58:10.350
A bad thing.

58:11.613 --> 58:14.161
A bad thing.

58:14.431 --> 58:19.382
Not only those two, the captain also.

58:22.130 --> 58:23.453
And Bennet.

58:25.751 --> 58:27.110
What was it, Rose?

58:30.211 --> 58:32.120
I made a promise.

58:32.131 --> 58:35.692
I swore it, never ever to tell.

58:36.910 --> 58:38.754
Then you must not, Rose.

58:40.814 --> 58:42.443
Never break a promise.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.627
You sent for me?

59:43.301 --> 59:44.980
Quid pro quo.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.722
Here we are.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:12.053
Nate, in you go.

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:20.038
After you, Madam, Captain.

01:00:35.111 --> 01:00:36.311
Here.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:44.168
Hush now, children.

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:47.130
Captain...

01:01:46.147 --> 01:01:48.443
Only the lock, correct? Correct?

01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:50.644
Yes, correct.

01:02:08.351 --> 01:02:09.598
Matthew, wait.

01:02:24.204 --> 01:02:26.571
Too much spice in your stew, Captain.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.100
Nat...

01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:34.609
No, no. Abel, I will not
have more blood on my tally.

01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:37.899
Not yours, my girl, mine.
Mine can manage the extra.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.499
You step aside. Get your crockery.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.565
Up here!

01:02:43.946 --> 01:02:46.196
- Where?
- Here!

01:02:46.197 --> 01:02:48.189
Hey, ugh!

01:02:48.436 --> 01:02:51.334
Ah, ah! Ah!

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.237
- For this?
- Here.

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:30.184
Anything else you wish
to pilfer? Or do we sail?
