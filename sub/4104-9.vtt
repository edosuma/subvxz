WEBVTT

00:03.354 --> 00:05.231
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.398 --> 00:07.275
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.442 --> 00:10.403
<i>or breathed real air
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.362 --> 00:12.362
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:12.405 --> 00:13.948
<i>For three generations,</i>

00:14.115 --> 00:16.993
<i>the Ark has kept what's left
of the human race alive.</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:19.120
<i>But now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.287 --> 00:22.248
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind,</i>

00:22.415 --> 00:25.627
<i>one hundred prisoners sent on
a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:25.793 --> 00:28.046
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.212 --> 00:30.298
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:30.465 --> 00:33.885
<i>All we have to do is survive,
but we will be tested</i>

00:34.052 --> 00:37.305
<i>by the earth,
by the secrets it hides,</i>

00:37.472 --> 00:39.515
<i>and, most of all, by each other.</i>

00:41.392 --> 00:42.644
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:42.810 --> 00:45.897
Ark Station, please come in.
We need you.

00:46.564 --> 00:48.292
Are you saying there are
survivors on the ground?

00:48.316 --> 00:50.568
Yes. The earth is survivable.

00:50.735 --> 00:53.029
<i>The Grounder
saved Octavia's life,</i>

00:53.196 --> 00:55.740
<i>and Bellamy brought him
back here and tortured him.</i>

00:55.907 --> 00:58.701
My name is Lincoln.

01:02.955 --> 01:03.956
Let's go.

01:04.123 --> 01:07.001
With the Grounder escaping,
we should expect retaliation.

01:07.168 --> 01:10.004
We are going to the ground,
but not all of us are.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.758
There are 2,237 people on this Ark,

01:13.925 --> 01:16.511
and there are only enough
dropships to carry 700.

01:19.263 --> 01:24.394
<i>My friends,
this is an historic Unity Day.</i>

01:24.560 --> 01:27.271
<i>Every year, we mark the moment
our ancestors of the 12 stations</i>

01:27.438 --> 01:29.065
<i>joined to form The Ark,</i>

01:29.232 --> 01:32.276
<i>but this is the last time
we do so while aboard her.</i>

01:33.111 --> 01:36.406
<i>Next year... on the ground.</i>

01:38.199 --> 01:41.244
Right. After we did all the work.

01:41.411 --> 01:43.579
- Someone shut him up.
- You shut up, Miller.

01:43.746 --> 01:45.123
No one's forcing you to watch.

01:46.165 --> 01:49.585
<i>For 97 years,
we have eked out an existence,</i>

01:49.752 --> 01:52.964
<i>hoping that someday our
descendants would return to earth...</i>

01:53.131 --> 01:55.174
Don't tell me
you don't like Unity Day.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.011
Unity Day is a lie.

02:00.221 --> 02:02.515
The Ark only came together
after the 13th Station

02:02.682 --> 02:04.475
was blown out of the sky.

02:04.642 --> 02:08.812
Just not the version of history
we like to tell each other at parties.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.900
The Unity Day story
gives people hope, though,

02:13.067 --> 02:14.902
and peace came out of that violence.

02:16.821 --> 02:19.699
Yeah, but did there need
to be violence at all?

02:28.416 --> 02:30.084
Whoo!

02:30.334 --> 02:31.961
Yeah!

02:32.128 --> 02:33.713
Monty strikes again!

02:33.921 --> 02:38.885
Hey! Call this batch Unity Juice!
Who's thirsty?

02:44.557 --> 02:45.892
Hey, save me some!

02:50.271 --> 02:52.273
Happy Unity Day.

03:04.744 --> 03:06.162
Pass it around.

03:07.163 --> 03:11.000
<i>To our sons and daughters on earth
listening to this message,</i>

03:11.167 --> 03:13.878
<i>we will see you soon.</i>

03:14.045 --> 03:17.048
The first Exodus ship
will launch in under 60 hours,

03:17.215 --> 03:19.592
carrying the reinforcements
that you need.

03:19.759 --> 03:23.054
So stay strong.
Help is on the way.

03:32.563 --> 03:35.483
- Hello, Abby.
- Diana.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.485
We have seen the true soul
of our people.

03:37.652 --> 03:40.988
I hope there are no hard feelings
about me taking the council seat.

03:41.155 --> 03:44.492
No hard feelings about
anything at all today.

03:45.409 --> 03:47.912
That's right. You'll be able
to see your daughter soon.

03:48.079 --> 03:49.664
But enough from me.

03:49.831 --> 03:52.333
You are all here
for the pageant anyway, right?

03:56.587 --> 03:59.674
- He's cutting his remarks short.
- What's that?

04:00.883 --> 04:04.095
Oh, nothing.
I helped him with his speech.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.347
He's leaving the best part out.

04:08.474 --> 04:12.645
Without further ado,
I present the story of us.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.237
They tell me you'll be
on the first Exodus ship.

04:21.404 --> 04:23.823
Yes. I'm overseeing security
on the ground.

04:23.990 --> 04:26.117
Would you take the tree down for me?

04:26.284 --> 04:27.827
Mom, I have a job to do.

04:27.994 --> 04:29.794
Well, at least come to
the departure ceremony.

04:29.829 --> 04:31.349
You could give
the traveler's blessing.

04:31.455 --> 04:33.624
Think of it as a good-bye gift
for your mother.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.001
I don't remember it.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.294
Excuse me.

04:41.132 --> 04:43.426
Long ago when the earth was on fire,

04:43.593 --> 04:47.471
twelve stations floated
through space all alone.

04:47.638 --> 04:50.224
Then one day,
<i>Mir</i> floated by <i>Shenzhen</i>,

04:50.391 --> 04:53.978
and they realized
life would be better together.

04:54.145 --> 04:57.773
The other stations saw this,
and they wanted to be together, too.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.902
When all the stations were joined,
they called themselves...

05:25.927 --> 05:27.261
Daddy?

05:27.428 --> 05:29.347
I'll go and find and your daddy.

05:29.513 --> 05:32.141
Jaha, are you okay?

05:38.022 --> 05:40.399
- Get him to medical now!
- Kane!

05:41.442 --> 05:42.944
Find out who did this!

05:47.531 --> 05:48.866
Mom.

05:50.660 --> 05:51.786
Mom.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.248
We need triage supplies now!

06:14.725 --> 06:17.103
Dr. Griffin, we need
your help over here.

06:25.736 --> 06:29.073
In peace, may you leave the shore.

06:30.616 --> 06:33.202
In love, may you find the next.

06:36.122 --> 06:38.666
Safe passage on your travels...

06:40.084 --> 06:42.795
...until our final journey
to the ground...

06:45.506 --> 06:47.258
...may we meet again.

06:57.059 --> 06:58.644
Marcus...

06:59.854 --> 07:01.105
I'm so sorry.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.113
We need to get you out of here.

07:09.989 --> 07:11.407
Sir.

07:12.992 --> 07:14.785
This was a coup.

07:14.952 --> 07:18.247
Councilors Cole, Kaplan,
Muir, and Fuji are dead.

07:18.414 --> 07:19.894
If you hadn't
cut your speech short...

07:19.957 --> 07:21.250
Where's Councilor Sydney?

07:22.168 --> 07:23.794
She left before the blast.

07:25.755 --> 07:27.131
I'll find her.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.927
You do that...
and double the guard at the dropship.

07:32.094 --> 07:34.138
I'm putting the Ark on lockdown!

07:40.311 --> 07:44.440
We are not... missing
that launch window.

07:54.658 --> 07:56.494
They suspect it was you.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.996
The way I see it,
we got two choices:

07:59.163 --> 08:01.123
stay and fight,
in which case maybe we win

08:01.290 --> 08:02.726
if we can get enough
workers to join us.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.502
Maybe we don't,
what's the second choice?

08:04.668 --> 08:07.004
- Take the Exodus ship now.
- It's not ready.

08:07.171 --> 08:08.422
Can our engineers get it ready?

08:08.589 --> 08:10.716
To charge the batteries
on a ship that size

08:10.883 --> 08:13.928
without causing a disruption
to the Ark takes time.

08:14.095 --> 08:16.847
- Then cause disruptions.
- It'll get cold.

08:17.014 --> 08:18.766
With the lockdown,
even if they find a way

08:18.933 --> 08:22.436
to isolate the lesser
populated stations, people will die.

08:24.522 --> 08:26.482
So there's casualties either way.

08:31.695 --> 08:33.489
Take the Exodus ship.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.200
We should have built a bigger bomb.

08:47.169 --> 08:49.713
Hey. The comms are still dead.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.715
They cut out during the pageant.

08:52.716 --> 08:55.136
Best Unity Day ever.

08:58.139 --> 09:00.492
Do you really think now is a
good time to be having a party?

09:00.516 --> 09:01.956
I mean, the Grounder is out there...

09:02.017 --> 09:04.395
The Grounders.
By now, he's made it home.

09:04.562 --> 09:06.242
He's probably putting together
a lynch mob.

09:06.355 --> 09:08.524
Relax. I got security covered.

09:10.109 --> 09:11.652
Why don't you go get a drink?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.487
You look like you could use one.

09:15.906 --> 09:18.159
I could use more than one.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.827
Then have more than one.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.788
Clarke, the Exodus ship
carrying your mother

09:22.955 --> 09:24.665
comes down here in two days.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.418
After that, the party's over.

09:27.585 --> 09:29.712
Have some fun while you still can.

09:29.879 --> 09:31.213
You deserve it.

09:34.925 --> 09:37.887
Yeah. Okay.

09:41.891 --> 09:44.310
So do you, by the way.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.562
I'll have my fun
when the Grounders come.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.523
All right.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.945
Unity Day.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.169
Making bullets on Unity Day.

10:11.754 --> 10:13.714
The Grounders
don't know it's Unity Day.

10:14.798 --> 10:16.425
How did Bellamy get you to help?

10:16.592 --> 10:18.886
I volunteered.
We have to be ready to fight, right?

10:20.512 --> 10:22.681
Or we could try talking to them.

10:22.848 --> 10:24.600
They seem to prefer stabbing.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.938
Violence is the only thing
those people understand.

10:29.855 --> 10:32.107
You know, they could say
the same thing about us.

10:37.655 --> 10:40.991
If we keep going on this way,
we'll never stop digging graves.

10:41.825 --> 10:45.246
You didn't see him, Finn.
It didn't matter what we did to him.

10:46.205 --> 10:47.790
He was ready to let you die.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.542
He was protecting himself.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.379
Why are you defending him?

10:58.342 --> 10:59.593
Never mind.

11:02.346 --> 11:04.014
Hope you know what you're doing.

11:09.645 --> 11:11.522
I know what I'm doing.

12:01.071 --> 12:02.531
Better?

12:04.283 --> 12:06.327
We'll make a warrior out of you yet.

13:38.419 --> 13:39.670
Finn?!

13:39.837 --> 13:42.005
Lincoln, wait, wait!
He's my friend.

13:52.391 --> 13:54.101
I think you lost this.

14:00.858 --> 14:03.026
So what the hell are you doing here?

14:03.193 --> 14:05.070
I could ask you the same thing.

14:05.237 --> 14:08.449
I could also ask how long
you've known he speaks English.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.577
But I won't.

14:16.081 --> 14:18.375
You blew this when your
people were hunting us.

14:20.210 --> 14:22.087
You saved our lives.

14:22.254 --> 14:24.214
I have to believe
there's more like you.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.053
- I stabbed you.
- And we tortured you.

14:30.220 --> 14:33.932
If the two of us can get along,
then maybe there's hope.

14:34.099 --> 14:35.910
Learn from history instead
of repeating it, right?

14:35.934 --> 14:37.311
How's that gonna happen?

14:38.770 --> 14:42.566
For starters, no more killing.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.527
I don't have the power
to call a truce.

14:46.153 --> 14:48.071
Then bring me to someone who does.

14:49.323 --> 14:53.494
Hey, look. The rest of our people
are coming down here.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.079
- The first ship lands in two days.
- It's true.

14:56.246 --> 14:58.606
And because of the attacks,
they're sending mostly soldiers,

14:58.749 --> 15:01.084
the people that enforce our laws.

15:01.502 --> 15:04.213
The Ark is about survival
at any cost,

15:04.379 --> 15:07.841
and they'll kill people
who fall out of line.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.011
When those people get down here,
if they feel threatened,

15:11.178 --> 15:15.015
they will start a war,
and I don't want that.

15:15.766 --> 15:17.100
Neither do you,

15:17.267 --> 15:19.478
and I think that's why
you blew that horn.

15:22.064 --> 15:24.274
Once the soldiers get here,
it'll be too late,

15:24.441 --> 15:26.693
and we'll have no power to stop them.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.404
But if they see that we're at peace...

15:30.155 --> 15:32.783
...then maybe we have
a chance to stay that way.

15:40.332 --> 15:41.792
All right.

15:42.793 --> 15:44.711
You bring your leader,
I'll bring mine.

15:46.296 --> 15:48.257
What, Bellamy?
He'll never go for this.

15:48.423 --> 15:51.385
No. Not your brother.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.305
Clarke.

16:04.606 --> 16:06.024
Check. Bay 17's clear.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.610
All right. It's clear back here.

16:11.321 --> 16:13.907
Sir, the dropship's clear.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.701
We did a full security sweep.

16:16.952 --> 16:19.705
Okay, boys and girls.
Play time's over.

16:19.871 --> 16:22.916
Back to work.
Let's get this ship ready to launch.

16:25.002 --> 16:27.754
I should be in medical,
not packing first aid supplies.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.257
The injured are being taken care of.

16:31.675 --> 16:33.218
And we can do nothing for the dead.

16:37.806 --> 16:39.558
Marcus.

16:41.643 --> 16:43.312
I'm sorry.

16:45.188 --> 16:47.524
Vera was an amazing spirit.

16:49.735 --> 16:52.321
This launch should be delayed,

16:52.487 --> 16:55.198
at least until you've questioned
the terrorist that set that bomb.

16:55.365 --> 16:58.368
I put word out to my people
and just heard back.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.537
His name is Cuyler Ridley.

17:00.704 --> 17:03.332
He's a mechanic who lost
his wife in the culling.

17:07.711 --> 17:09.463
Yeah. I recognize him.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.132
So what makes you think he did it?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.387
He turned himself in.

17:19.890 --> 17:21.808
Where have you been, Diana?

17:23.352 --> 17:25.186
Why did you leave the pageant early?

17:25.354 --> 17:27.521
Thank God I did,
or I'd be dead right now.

17:27.689 --> 17:29.441
I guess we're both lucky.

17:34.696 --> 17:36.782
Stay where we can find you.

17:36.948 --> 17:38.909
Where am I gonna go, Kane?

17:41.036 --> 17:42.704
Be careful.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.873
Ridley's dangerous.

18:04.101 --> 18:05.310
You're not gonna get this one.

18:05.477 --> 18:07.145
- Yes, I am.
- No. It's not happening.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.779
What do you know?
Her Highness can actually party.

18:15.946 --> 18:18.323
- I like it.
- So what are you gonna do

18:18.490 --> 18:21.368
when the guard come down
and commandeer Monty's still?

18:21.535 --> 18:22.994
Build another.

18:24.788 --> 18:26.289
All right. You ready?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.710
No. Wait.

18:30.335 --> 18:32.462
I have done this before, I promise.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.093
What is it?

18:38.677 --> 18:40.262
Let's take a walk.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.100
Sorry.

18:51.314 --> 18:52.482
Did something happen?

18:52.649 --> 18:54.969
I need you to come with me,
but I can't tell you why, okay?

18:55.026 --> 18:56.319
Finn, tell me why.

18:57.571 --> 18:58.822
Hey. Don't.

19:03.034 --> 19:04.995
I set up a meeting
with the Grounders.

19:06.663 --> 19:10.167
A meeting? I don't understand.
With who? How?

19:10.333 --> 19:12.353
I was just with the Grounder
that we had in the dropship.

19:12.377 --> 19:14.504
- His name is Lincoln.
- Wait a second.

19:14.671 --> 19:16.715
- He spoke to you?
- It's not important.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.550
If we want to live in peace...

19:18.717 --> 19:20.677
Finn, we can't live
in peace with people

19:20.844 --> 19:22.387
who've done nothing but kill us.

19:22.554 --> 19:24.594
Can you think of a better way
to stop the bloodshed?

19:24.681 --> 19:26.975
Yeah. With the guns that
the guard bring down.

19:27.142 --> 19:28.810
You really want a war?

19:28.977 --> 19:31.062
Because at this rate,
that's what's coming.

19:32.856 --> 19:36.151
Look. I know it's a long shot.

19:38.195 --> 19:39.821
But this is our world now,

19:39.988 --> 19:43.366
and I think we can do better
than the first time around.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.497
I trust him.

19:50.665 --> 19:51.833
I don't.

19:56.671 --> 20:00.300
But if we go...
we have to bring backup.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.052
No way. We're not bringing guns.

20:02.219 --> 20:03.595
Those weren't the terms,

20:03.762 --> 20:07.015
and if we're gonna do this,
we got to give it a fair shot.

20:13.897 --> 20:14.981
Okay.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.569
Okay. I'll... I'll get my pack,
and I'll meet you at the gate.

20:19.736 --> 20:21.530
Okay.

20:29.704 --> 20:32.707
Hey. I need to talk to you.

20:32.874 --> 20:35.544
- Having fun yet, princess?
- I'm serious.

20:35.877 --> 20:37.671
You always are, so talk.

20:39.214 --> 20:41.591
Finn's set up a meeting
with the Grounders.

20:43.343 --> 20:44.845
I'm leaving to go talk to them.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.055
Because you figure that impaling
people on spears

20:47.222 --> 20:49.182
is code for "let's be friends"?

20:49.349 --> 20:51.059
Have you lost your damn mind?

20:51.810 --> 20:53.937
I think it might be worth a shot.

20:54.104 --> 20:56.690
I mean, we do have
to live with these people.

20:57.941 --> 21:00.694
They'll probably gut you,
string you up as a warning.

21:01.236 --> 21:02.946
Well, that's why I'm here.

21:03.780 --> 21:06.449
I need you to follow us,
be our backup.

21:06.616 --> 21:08.285
Does Finn know about this?

21:09.703 --> 21:11.538
Finn doesn't need to know.

21:12.205 --> 21:16.209
And, Bellamy... bring guns.

21:26.803 --> 21:29.014
Hey, hey! There you are.

21:29.180 --> 21:32.309
All right. Listen.
We're playing drunkball.

21:32.475 --> 21:35.729
I bet Monroe my team's gonna win
the Unity Day title.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.606
That's for you.

21:37.772 --> 21:41.610
I know you zero-G mechs
have crazy hand-eye skills, so?

21:42.277 --> 21:44.571
Huh? What do you think?

21:44.738 --> 21:47.657
It's got to be more fun than...
whatever you're doing.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.535
I'm checking the gunpowder
in these rounds

21:50.702 --> 21:52.346
so that if the Grounders
try to kill us all,

21:52.370 --> 21:54.748
maybe we can get a few
shots off beforehand.

21:54.956 --> 21:58.251
Hm... That's intense.
Sure you know what you're doing?

21:58.418 --> 22:00.170
Why does everyone keep asking me...

22:00.879 --> 22:02.255
Damn!

22:02.422 --> 22:05.926
You need a hand now that,
you know, you almost blew one off?

22:06.259 --> 22:09.179
- I got this.
- Hey... no one's a better mechanic,

22:09.346 --> 22:13.558
all right, but this stuff
requires a chemist.

22:13.725 --> 22:15.810
How'd you do in chemistry class?

22:15.936 --> 22:17.604
Mm!

22:17.771 --> 22:21.024
Well, the fates are smiling
upon you, my friend.

22:22.025 --> 22:23.860
I was great in chemistry.

22:25.862 --> 22:27.197
Hm...

22:27.906 --> 22:31.201
Ooh! Nope. It's gassed off.

22:31.368 --> 22:34.996
Pretty sure the acidic smell means
that the gunpowder's degraded.

22:35.163 --> 22:37.374
Better start a dud pile.

22:37.540 --> 22:38.893
You know, when my parents get here,

22:38.917 --> 22:41.378
they can mix us up
some new gunpowder.

22:41.544 --> 22:43.144
My dad's gonna flip
for this scrap metal.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.590
"My kingdom for a soda can."

22:45.966 --> 22:48.051
That's what he always used to say.

22:48.218 --> 22:51.221
How about you?
Got any family?

22:52.222 --> 22:55.392
Nope. Just Finn.

22:57.394 --> 22:59.646
Well, we all
got each other now, right?

23:03.942 --> 23:07.404
- Jasper, you're coming with me.
- I am?

23:07.570 --> 23:09.823
You handled yourself well
in the cave with the Grounder.

23:09.990 --> 23:11.449
I mean, I hit him in the head.

23:11.616 --> 23:14.244
If you're planning on shooting
anything, you better think twice.

23:14.411 --> 23:16.806
- I haven't checked those yet.
- Give me some bullets that work.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.248
What do you need them for?

23:18.790 --> 23:20.667
Your boyfriend's being an idiot.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.672
- I'm coming with you.
- We should get Clarke.

23:27.924 --> 23:30.593
Clarke's with Finn, isn't she?

23:46.234 --> 23:48.278
I'd love it if you
were right about this,

23:48.445 --> 23:50.989
but did you ever consider
it might be a trap?

23:51.156 --> 23:53.783
Yep, but since it's Unity Day,

23:53.950 --> 23:56.327
I decided to have hope instead.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.536
Ah!

23:57.662 --> 24:00.665
Oh. Hey. Let me have a look at that.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.306
Seriously, Finn,
you're putting a lot of faith

24:16.473 --> 24:18.308
in a guy who stuck a knife in you.

24:18.475 --> 24:20.477
And you're sounding more
and more like Bellamy.

24:20.643 --> 24:22.645
I'm just trying to keep us alive.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.274
So am I.

24:39.329 --> 24:40.723
At least they're good for something.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.099
Sorry about
bringing up Clarke earlier.

24:42.123 --> 24:43.625
- That was awkward.
- Shut up.

24:43.792 --> 24:46.544
Both of you shut up.
Keep your eyes open.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.220
You were seen
planting the bomb, Ridley.

24:55.386 --> 24:57.347
You killed six people.

24:57.514 --> 24:58.598
Should have been seven.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.934
Jaha's lucky he cut his speech short.

25:01.101 --> 25:03.520
I know you're upset about
what happened at Section 17.

25:03.686 --> 25:06.648
I lost my wife!
You're damn right I'm upset!

25:07.398 --> 25:09.150
But this is about
more than the culling.

25:09.317 --> 25:12.320
Workers all over the Ark
are tired of getting screwed.

25:12.570 --> 25:14.781
It's our kids you sent
to die on earth,

25:14.906 --> 25:16.574
and who's on the first dropship?

25:16.699 --> 25:17.700
Not us.

25:18.201 --> 25:21.704
Over and over, Jaha and the rest of
you on the council betray our trust.

25:21.871 --> 25:23.790
Today is your reckoning.

25:24.499 --> 25:27.168
Tell me...
Who helped you?

25:28.419 --> 25:29.879
I know you didn't act alone.

25:30.046 --> 25:31.965
You don't know jack.

25:33.216 --> 25:36.427
You still think this
is just about the chancellor.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.265
- Ah!

25:42.559 --> 25:44.894
There goes the power.
That's our cue.

25:45.061 --> 25:47.313
Leave him.
He's gonna die in here anyway.

25:58.032 --> 25:59.576
What's happened?

26:00.535 --> 26:04.372
I'm not sure. But we've lost power
to multiple stations.

26:04.539 --> 26:07.500
Farm, Hydra, Mecha.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.253
Now, we can vent in breathable air,

26:10.420 --> 26:12.839
but the temperature in those
sections is falling fast.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.841
People are gonna freeze to death.

26:15.466 --> 26:17.927
Lift the lockdown
and evacuate those stations.

26:18.094 --> 26:20.221
- Where's Kane?
- He's interrogating the bomber.

26:20.388 --> 26:24.267
Sir...
Power's out in prison station.

26:34.986 --> 26:36.321
Marcus!

26:38.323 --> 26:39.782
It's a mutiny.

26:39.949 --> 26:43.203
Diana Sydney...
She's... She's diverting power.

26:43.953 --> 26:46.164
She's taking the Exodus ship.

27:02.555 --> 27:05.975
- Whoa! What the hell are you doing?
- This is our ship now.

27:07.352 --> 27:08.811
Chancellor on deck.

27:14.943 --> 27:17.820
- How many of our people are on board?
- Less than 50 percent, ma'am.

27:17.987 --> 27:19.822
They're all upstairs
on the passenger deck.

27:19.989 --> 27:22.200
- Tell me about the cargo.
- Nearly all here.

27:22.617 --> 27:25.161
Search all the decks.
Throw anyone not loyal to us

27:25.328 --> 27:27.330
out of the service hatches
and back into the Ark.

27:27.497 --> 27:29.165
Lieutenant, you may give the order.

27:29.332 --> 27:31.167
Seal the doors,
begin the launch protocol.

27:31.334 --> 27:33.169
We're T-minus five and counting.

27:33.336 --> 27:35.922
Let him go! He's made his choice.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.549
- He'll warn Jaha.
- That hardly matters now.

27:38.716 --> 27:41.386
This Exodus ship belongs
to all of you.

27:41.552 --> 27:44.180
You're the future of the human race,

27:44.347 --> 27:47.809
and today,
I'm going to lead you home.

28:14.294 --> 28:16.045
So that's how you set this up.

28:17.755 --> 28:19.465
You helped him escape, didn't you?

28:20.550 --> 28:24.220
- I trust him, Clarke.
- There's a lot of that going around.

28:25.555 --> 28:26.931
Someone's coming.

28:36.733 --> 28:38.735
What's Octavia doing here?

28:47.452 --> 28:50.330
- Oh...
- I guess we know how he got away.

29:14.937 --> 29:17.273
Wait. Look.

29:21.611 --> 29:24.197
Oh, my God. Horses!

29:29.827 --> 29:31.621
We said no weapons!

29:36.876 --> 29:38.711
I was told there wouldn't be.

29:39.462 --> 29:41.047
It's too late now.

29:48.971 --> 29:50.681
She goes alone.

29:55.812 --> 29:57.605
- I'll be fine.
- Clarke...

29:57.772 --> 30:00.983
Hey. It's time to do better.

31:01.669 --> 31:03.087
Your name is Clarke?

31:03.880 --> 31:05.089
Yes.

31:05.381 --> 31:06.716
I'm Anya.

31:15.183 --> 31:17.935
I think we got off to a rough start.

31:19.395 --> 31:22.982
But we want to find a way
to live together in peace.

31:24.025 --> 31:25.693
I understand.

31:25.860 --> 31:28.738
You started a war that
you don't know how to end.

31:28.905 --> 31:31.908
What? No. We didn't start anything.

31:32.074 --> 31:34.869
- You attacked us for no reason.
- No reason?

31:35.036 --> 31:38.581
The missiles you launched
burned a village to the ground.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.918
The flares?

31:42.084 --> 31:45.171
No. That was a signal
meant for our families.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.465
- We had no idea...
- You're invaders.

31:47.632 --> 31:50.092
Your ship landed in our territory.

31:50.259 --> 31:52.094
We didn't know anyone was here.

31:52.261 --> 31:54.180
We thought the ground
was uninhabited.

31:54.347 --> 31:57.350
You knew we were here when you
sent an armed raiding party

31:57.517 --> 31:59.477
to capture one of us and torture him.

32:01.812 --> 32:04.148
These are all acts of war.

32:06.442 --> 32:08.277
I see your point.

32:11.113 --> 32:13.658
That's why we need to put
an end to all of this.

32:21.290 --> 32:23.000
I told you,
it happened very fast.

32:23.167 --> 32:25.103
I'm not even sure if Dr. Griffin
was inside at the time.

32:25.127 --> 32:26.379
I'm sorry.

32:28.130 --> 32:29.966
Sir, the Exodus ship
is fully charged,

32:30.132 --> 32:32.009
and they've begun
the launch protocol.

32:32.176 --> 32:34.071
It won't launch when
the door's open, that's correct?

32:34.095 --> 32:35.846
- It is.
- Then get the damn door open.

32:36.013 --> 32:37.515
We can't. It's already pressurized,

32:37.682 --> 32:38.992
and we can only open it
from the inside.

32:39.016 --> 32:40.935
- Keep trying!
- How long until launch?

32:41.102 --> 32:42.979
Two minutes.

32:43.145 --> 32:46.065
- Diana, open the door!
- Sitrep forthcoming, ma'am.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.150
We should be ready
for launch momentarily.

32:48.317 --> 32:50.037
Upper levels clear?
Okay. Complete the sweep

32:50.069 --> 32:51.509
- and secure the hatches.
- Yes, sir!

32:51.612 --> 32:53.406
Assume flight positions.

32:54.198 --> 32:56.117
Hey! What are you doing?

33:03.124 --> 33:04.458
Abby?

33:07.837 --> 33:10.131
- Diana, don't do this.
- It's already done.

33:10.298 --> 33:11.841
- Get her out of here.
- Wait.

33:12.008 --> 33:15.261
We could use a doctor on the ground.
Come with us.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.179
You owe Jaha no loyalty.

33:17.346 --> 33:19.682
He's killed your husband
and betrayed you.

33:19.849 --> 33:21.267
You're just like us.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.060
Think of your daughter, Abby.

33:23.227 --> 33:25.855
You can see Clarke again, today.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.195
I'm nothing like you.

33:34.363 --> 33:35.948
Whoa! Whoa!

33:37.617 --> 33:38.784
Abby!

33:45.541 --> 33:48.044
I got my pry bar in!
Somebody get me a jack!

33:54.342 --> 33:58.095
Lincoln said there are more
of you coming down, warriors.

33:58.262 --> 34:02.183
The guard, yes. But also farmers,

34:02.350 --> 34:04.226
doctors, engineers.

34:04.393 --> 34:07.605
We can help each other,
but not if we're at war.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.943
Can you promise that these
new arrivals won't attack us,

34:13.110 --> 34:16.155
that they'll respect the terms
you and I agree on?

34:17.364 --> 34:19.742
I promise I will do everything I can

34:19.909 --> 34:22.244
to convince them to honor
the terms that we set.

34:23.245 --> 34:25.498
Why would I agree to an alliance

34:25.665 --> 34:29.126
that your people can break
the moment they get here?

34:35.049 --> 34:37.009
Grounder princess looks pissed.

34:37.426 --> 34:39.219
Our princess has that effect.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.389
If you fire the first shot,

34:42.556 --> 34:45.559
those people coming down
won't bother negotiating.

34:47.395 --> 34:51.482
Our technology...
They will wipe you out.

34:52.900 --> 34:55.152
They wouldn't be the first to try.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.330
Oh, no. No. This is bad.

35:07.331 --> 35:08.771
What the hell are you talking about?

35:22.304 --> 35:23.806
There's Grounders in the trees.

35:23.973 --> 35:25.683
- What?
- Where?

35:25.850 --> 35:27.518
- Are you sure?
- I don't see anything.

35:30.938 --> 35:33.107
They're gonna shoot! Clarke, run!

35:33.899 --> 35:35.151
Run!

35:43.576 --> 35:45.161
Clarke, get down!

35:51.625 --> 35:53.335
Finn, get back!

35:55.254 --> 35:57.548
Go, go!

36:08.225 --> 36:10.728
Oh my God, Lincoln!
You've been hit.

36:10.895 --> 36:12.563
It's just a scratch.

36:14.231 --> 36:16.311
Okay. Run. Don't stop till
you get behind your walls.

36:16.358 --> 36:18.152
- Go! Take her!
- Lincoln, no!

36:18.319 --> 36:20.154
Go!

36:37.254 --> 36:38.923
I got the jack!

36:45.095 --> 36:47.056
Where's Abby?
Send her through!

36:47.223 --> 36:49.391
I will if you let the doors close.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.038
- No, no, no. They haven't decoupled!
- What does that mean?

36:53.062 --> 36:55.540
It means the dropship's still tied
into all of our major systems.

36:55.564 --> 36:57.441
Power, water, air...

36:57.608 --> 36:59.235
If it launches,
the Ark will be crippled,

36:59.401 --> 37:00.861
and everyone left on board will die.

37:01.028 --> 37:02.964
- Can we do it from our side?
- Yes, but it takes hours,

37:02.988 --> 37:05.491
- and they're not waiting!
- Diana, please!

37:05.658 --> 37:07.409
You don't want to be
remembered like this.

37:07.576 --> 37:09.411
I won't be.

37:09.912 --> 37:12.248
Because you
brought this on yourself, Jaha!

37:12.414 --> 37:16.001
You promised the people truth,
and all you gave them were lies!

37:16.168 --> 37:17.878
You had me shot!

37:18.045 --> 37:22.258
You detonated a bomb in a public
meeting, killing six innocent people!

37:22.424 --> 37:24.844
And now you want to kill
everyone on this space station

37:25.010 --> 37:29.306
- to satisfy your ego?
- He is still lying to your face.

37:29.473 --> 37:32.560
There aren't enough dropships
to get everyone down to the ground.

37:35.938 --> 37:37.439
What is she talking about?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.779
Trust me, we will figure this out.

37:43.946 --> 37:46.115
We will survive, we always do!

37:46.282 --> 37:49.618
- Go! Come on!
- You can't trust him.

37:49.785 --> 37:53.747
More than 1,000 people,
most of them workers like you,

37:53.914 --> 37:56.625
are gonna be left behind to die.

37:56.792 --> 37:59.003
You can still save yourself.

38:03.299 --> 38:05.175
I don't trust either of you.

38:07.177 --> 38:08.804
We've lost the main power generator.

38:08.971 --> 38:11.599
But I'm going to the ground!

38:13.434 --> 38:14.560
No!

38:16.979 --> 38:18.188
Launch!

38:18.355 --> 38:20.983
Sir, we have to go right now!
Everybody out!

38:21.150 --> 38:23.027
Get back behind
the containment doors.

38:23.485 --> 38:24.612
Go, go, go!

38:26.405 --> 38:28.240
Please, sir.

39:14.536 --> 39:16.872
- You got something to say?
- Yeah. I told you no guns!

39:17.039 --> 39:19.184
I told you we couldn't
trust the Grounders. I was right!

39:19.208 --> 39:21.001
Why didn't you tell me
what you were up to?

39:21.168 --> 39:23.488
I tried, but you were too busy
making bullets for your gun.

39:23.545 --> 39:25.547
You're lucky she brought that!

39:25.714 --> 39:27.067
They came there to kill you, Finn.

39:27.091 --> 39:29.468
You don't know that.
Jasper fired the first shot!

39:29.635 --> 39:31.387
You ruined everything.

39:32.680 --> 39:33.889
I saved you!

39:36.767 --> 39:38.560
You're welcome.

39:38.727 --> 39:41.438
Well, if we weren't at war already,
we sure as hell are now.

39:44.233 --> 39:45.901
You didn't have to trust
the Grounders.

39:46.068 --> 39:47.820
You just had to trust me.

39:58.580 --> 40:01.583
Like I said, best Unity Day ever.

40:12.094 --> 40:13.554
The Exodus ship?

40:15.639 --> 40:17.057
Your mom's early.

40:25.482 --> 40:26.900
Wait.

40:27.067 --> 40:28.402
Too fast.

40:29.486 --> 40:31.030
No parachute?

40:32.114 --> 40:33.824
Somethings wrong.
