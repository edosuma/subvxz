[computer beeping]

00:04.071 --> 00:07.239
Hey, Willie. Will I be in your
way if I use the computer?

00:07.241 --> 00:10.642
Yeah. I'm looking for
a birthday present for Kate.

00:10.644 --> 00:14.246
In a garage? What does she want,
a hedge trimmer?

00:14.248 --> 00:17.616
No, I-I've joined the new
computer shopping service.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.885
Uh, this way I can shop
for just about anything I want

00:19.887 --> 00:22.521
without ever leaving my house.
I-isn't that great?

00:22.523 --> 00:25.157
Yeah, right. Why go outside?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.893
You'll only end up
with a little color.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.563
Isn't there anybody else
you could bother?

00:31.565 --> 00:35.300
We voted.
You were the people's choice.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.668
So what're you gonna spring for?

00:36.670 --> 00:39.605
Oh, I can't decide between
the high-heeled pumps

00:39.607 --> 00:41.840
and the cubic zirconia.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.243
Well, she does sleep with you.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.613
- Go for the pumps.
- It's settled.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.815
- Let me play "Donkey Kong."
- No, no, no.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.884
(Kate)
'Willie?'

00:51.886 --> 00:54.019
Act natural.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.255
- Willie..
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Tanner.

00:56.257 --> 01:00.125
And might I add, that's a lovely
dress you're wearing.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.527
How am I doing?

01:02.897 --> 01:04.997
Willie, do you know anything
about the Salvation Army

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
coming to pick up
our television set?

01:07.001 --> 01:09.301
Ah-ha, what a stroke of luck!

01:09.303 --> 01:12.304
Now we'll have room
for that new big-screen TV

01:12.306 --> 01:15.174
we've had our eyes on.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.708
Nice try, ALF.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.778
- I'll talk to them.
- Get a receipt!

01:23.717 --> 01:26.351
Let's go shopping!

01:26.353 --> 01:28.687
I need a new pair of lederhosen.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.123
So hard to find junior sizes.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.159
Which button is it?

01:34.161 --> 01:37.162
[keys clacking]

01:37.164 --> 01:39.331
Hello. What's this?

01:39.333 --> 01:42.968
"Welcome to
the Home Investor's Network."

01:42.970 --> 01:45.871
Hey! Think I'm gonna
like this game.

[music continues]

[instrumental music]

02:52.606 --> 02:55.073
Well, what do you guys think?

02:55.075 --> 02:58.911
Well, dad, maybe they looked
better on the monitor.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.547
Oh, there she is.
Don't say anything.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.348
Remember, it's a surprise.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.019
- 'Hi, mom.'
- 'Hi.'

03:08.455 --> 03:10.656
How about, "Hi, mom. Gosh,
you shouldn't be carrying

03:10.658 --> 03:12.724
those heavy things,
that's our job?"

03:12.726 --> 03:14.626
You read our minds.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.963
Ohh. Here, sweetie.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.097
[sighs]

03:20.167 --> 03:22.000
- Thank you, honey.
- Sure.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.405
Kate, do you know anything
about this letter?

03:28.075 --> 03:29.841
"Dear Mr. Tanner.
Enclosed please find

03:29.843 --> 03:34.079
confirmation numbers
for stocks purchased this week."

03:34.081 --> 03:36.014
Willie, I thought
we were gonna consult each other

03:36.016 --> 03:37.950
before doing anything stupid?

03:37.952 --> 03:40.986
Well, it's got to be a mistake.

03:40.988 --> 03:45.357
Probably a three-foot
furry mistake.

03:45.359 --> 03:49.394
Sometimes I think we should just
sign everything over to him

03:49.396 --> 03:52.698
and slip away
in the middle of the night

03:58.205 --> 04:04.509
"Congratulations. Your account
shows you are up by $5000."

04:04.511 --> 04:06.845
Yes! Yes!

04:08.849 --> 04:10.882
"Care to make another buy?"

04:10.884 --> 04:15.020
Are you kidding? Does
Willard Scott wear a toupee?

04:15.022 --> 04:17.055
- ALF.
- Oh, hi, Willie.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.125
You're just in time to see me
launch a hostile takeover.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.827
Whatever that is!

04:23.097 --> 04:25.897
Hey, I was right
in the middle of my game!

04:25.899 --> 04:27.833
This is not a game,
you've tapped into

04:27.835 --> 04:29.568
my stock-market service.

04:29.570 --> 04:32.704
You're investing my money!

04:32.706 --> 04:35.107
I'm playing with real money?

04:35.109 --> 04:39.378
- What a great game!
- It's not a game!

04:39.380 --> 04:42.814
You know,
you can beat a point to death.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.284
I'm not gonna let you
put my house, my family

04:45.286 --> 04:47.286
my whole life into jeopardy!

04:47.288 --> 04:50.289
Now, tell me, just tell me..

04:50.291 --> 04:52.090
How much?

04:52.092 --> 04:54.493
$5000.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.961
[grunts]

04:55.963 --> 04:57.963
Ahead.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.799
We're players, Willie.
Players!

05:00.801 --> 05:02.200
[exhales sharply]

05:03.704 --> 05:06.104
I knew you'd be happy.

05:06.106 --> 05:09.041
But you could've
lost everything, ALF.

05:09.043 --> 05:14.780
Let's just take this as
an unexpected windfall and stop!

05:14.782 --> 05:18.016
But I finally found a way
to make an honest living.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.986
Now, granted,
you'd be taking all the risks.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.888
But that's the beauty of it!

05:22.890 --> 05:24.856
Come on, Willie. Cut me loose.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.060
Let me fly.
Let my people go.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.129
Okay, ALF.

05:31.131 --> 05:33.298
You can continue
to play the market.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.268
Alright. Way to hang,
Willie boy!

05:36.270 --> 05:40.339
But only on paper!
That means no money.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.309
A pencil, a calculator,
a visor if you want.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.879
- Did I mention no money?
- In passing.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.419
Hey, no wonder
he works for the government.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.156
[instrumental music]

06:03.063 --> 06:07.232
Mom, I woke up with a craving
for French toast and sausage.

06:09.069 --> 06:13.205
Or oatmeal,
whichever's easiest for you.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.674
Does ALF know
that breakfast is ready?

06:15.676 --> 06:18.610
ALF! Breakfast is ready!

06:18.612 --> 06:19.945
Thank you.

06:20.647 --> 06:23.815
Oh, it's still here.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.050
You know, I never thought
I'd miss the sound

06:25.052 --> 06:27.619
of ALF hoovering down his food.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.354
What's bothering him, anyway?

06:29.356 --> 06:33.492
He's been glum, glum, glum since
daddy took his keyboard away.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.060
I heard that.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.162
I thought it was high time
we establish

06:37.164 --> 06:39.865
who, in fact, is in charge
in this house.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.867
And I'm pretty sure it's me.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.735
Uh, us.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.804
No particular order.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.640
Nice save, dad.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.941
- Good morning.
- 'Morning, ALF'

06:49.943 --> 06:52.544
- Hi, ALF.
- I have an apology to make.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.146
Willie, I've had a bad attitude

06:54.148 --> 06:56.114
since you took me
off the computer

06:56.116 --> 06:59.050
and I'd like to say I'm sorry.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.753
Well, thank you, ALF.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.622
It-it's big of you
to admit that.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.890
Thanks.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.627
There's more, isn't there?

07:08.629 --> 07:11.296
Well, yes. Lots more.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.498
Oh, no!

07:13.500 --> 07:16.001
Willie, my friend,
since you took back control

07:16.003 --> 07:21.840
of the family fortune
I've made us $11,000.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.209
On<i> paper!</i>

07:24.211 --> 07:26.511
$11,000?

07:26.513 --> 07:28.447
On<i> paper!</i>

07:28.449 --> 07:31.850
Here's your share.
Knock yourself out.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.554
Just out of curiosity, ALF..

07:35.556 --> 07:39.391
What system do you use
to pick these stocks?

07:39.393 --> 07:41.560
I select companies
whose initials

07:41.562 --> 07:44.963
spell out Melmacian holidays

07:44.965 --> 07:48.867
That's not a system.
It's just<i> dumb luck.</i>

07:48.869 --> 07:51.369
Willie, Willie,
Willie, Willie, Willie!

07:51.371 --> 07:52.504
Think about it.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.906
Now, there are people
who jump onboard

07:54.908 --> 07:57.175
and there are people
who are left on the dock.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.877
And then there are those
who are always late

07:58.879 --> 08:00.412
getting to the airport.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.483
What are you talking about?

08:04.485 --> 08:07.486
I don't know.
I sort of got lost there myself.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.388
I do remember
it having a travel theme.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.893
[instrumental music]

08:17.664 --> 08:19.865
- Kate?
- Uh-huh?

08:22.569 --> 08:24.703
You remember how we said
we'd consult each other

08:24.705 --> 08:27.472
before we did anything stupid?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.341
You want ALF
to invest our money, don't you?

08:29.343 --> 08:30.976
Because that
is about the stupidest thing

08:30.978 --> 08:32.644
that I could
think of at the moment.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.614
He'd only be working with the
$5000 that he's already made.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.717
- You can't be serious.
- But I know it sounds crazy.

08:38.719 --> 08:43.622
But every stock he's picked
has made money...o-on paper

08:43.624 --> 08:45.824
What if he has
some sort of incredible gift?

08:45.826 --> 08:48.460
Some unexplainable instinct.

08:48.462 --> 08:51.930
What if he's some kind of
an alien savant?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.867
Willie, what's this
really all about?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.469
[sighs]

08:57.471 --> 08:59.170
I don't know.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.007
Maybe I'd just like to be able
to get you nice things.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.909
Oh, I don't need nice things.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.478
I mean,
I have several nice things.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.313
Well, wouldn't we breathe
a lot easier

09:08.315 --> 09:12.417
if we could pay off a few
of the mortgages on this house?

09:12.419 --> 09:15.954
Honey, if that's what you
wanna do, then I-I'm behind you.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.689
But don't let him go
into our savings

09:17.691 --> 09:19.190
because that would be
really stupid

09:19.192 --> 09:21.526
and then,
we'd have to talk again.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.795
Thanks. Thanks.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.865
I, uh,
I just wanna go and tell ALF.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.101
I don't know.
Maybe he's still up.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.874

- Yeah, yeah!

If you must pace,
can you do it in one direction?

09:58.865 --> 10:01.733
Call me when you get to Fresno.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.174
Why, $20,000.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.145
It's just the beginning,
Willie.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.282
Do it. Let's sell.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.985
- I thought you trusted me.
- I do. I do.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.587
What am I saying?

10:22.589 --> 10:25.256
You know, we've been at this
for only two days.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.058
At this rate, do you realize

10:27.060 --> 10:29.127
where you'll be
at the end of the year?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.063
Yeah. I'll be in a clinic with
the pulse rate of a hummingbird.

10:33.433 --> 10:37.335
Yes, but hooked up to the best
machines money can buy.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.641
Listen, ALF,
I've been doing some research

10:42.643 --> 10:47.012
and I say we should invest
in a hundred shares of AT&T.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.014
I say BLaCh.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.283
But, ALF, AT&T
is an American institution.

10:52.285 --> 10:56.321
So were the Village People.
But where are they now?

10:56.323 --> 11:01.292
Trust me. It's BLaCh.
Boston Latrine Chemicals.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.728
Come on, you're acting
like you've never heard of it.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.163
I haven't.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.066
Well, Blach was
an important holiday on Melmac.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.970
- Need I say more?
- Yes. Lots.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.074
I say we invest
the whole 20 Gs.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.942
You've got
three minutes to decide.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.110
What?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.646
[humming "Final Jeopardy" theme]

11:22.849 --> 11:24.249
S-stop it!

11:25.652 --> 11:27.919
ALF, stop!

11:27.921 --> 11:29.087
I just don't think
that we should

11:29.089 --> 11:31.856
put all our eggs
into one basket.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.660
Will you keep your holidays
out of this?

11:35.662 --> 11:37.028
Now come on, Willie.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.064
Not only are they
the right initials

11:39.066 --> 11:41.700
but it's outdoor-concert season!

11:41.702 --> 11:44.636
Latrines are gonna go sky-high!

11:46.239 --> 11:49.908
I still say we diversify
and buy into several companies.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.843
Now, look, it says right here--

11:51.845 --> 11:55.313
Willie. Willie, honey, baby,
sweetheart.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.382
I can't make you a rich man
if you keep

11:57.384 --> 12:00.452
second-guessing
every senseless choice I make.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.022
Alright.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.690
BLaCh it is.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.459
I like your thinking.

12:07.461 --> 12:10.295
Now go get me
a fresh pot of coffee.

- Oh, Lynnie, Lynnie.

- It is beautiful.
- 'Nice.'

12:22.676 --> 12:24.109

12:24.111 --> 12:27.278
- Can I borrow it tonight?
- Sure. Here.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.782
Now, hurry up.
The Tokyo market just opened!

12:30.784 --> 12:33.251
Time is yen.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.688
- Here, mom. Open mine next.
- Okay.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.324
Let's see. Oh, oh, honey!

12:39.326 --> 12:42.260
[chuckles]
Honey, that is so sweet.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.797
- I made it myself.
- No kidding.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.499
Next.

12:47.501 --> 12:51.102
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thanks, sweetie.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.172
- Oh, good. Here come the pumps.
- Stop it.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.775
The pumps, Mr. Smarty

12:56.777 --> 12:59.978
are on their way back to Taiwan.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.548
- Oh, Willie, a crystal vase?
- 'Oh.'

13:03.550 --> 13:06.651
Hand-etched. From France.
Really heavy.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.555
Oh, I noticed. I love it, honey.
Thank you.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.223
- Ha-ha.
- Aw..

13:12.225 --> 13:15.193
Well, come on.
There's an alien present!

13:15.195 --> 13:18.296
Oh, ALF,
you've seen us kiss before.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.066
No, I mean
there's an alien present.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.869
That means, open the present
from the alien.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.138
- Okay.
- Ooh!

13:27.140 --> 13:30.475
Now, let's see here.
My goodness.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.445
Oh, ALF.
Oh, it's so generous.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.914
And so unlike you.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.283
- Look, Lynnie.
- Oh, wow.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.652
So you went
for the cubic zirconia.

13:40.654 --> 13:45.523
Ha! Would a cubic zirconia
do this?

13:45.525 --> 13:46.724
[Willie gasps]

13:48.562 --> 13:52.363
Hey, man,
like, I'm really sorry.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.700
Oh. Well, I guess one side

13:55.702 --> 13:58.403
has to face the wall anyway.

13:59.606 --> 14:02.307
Do you mean
these are real diamonds?

14:02.309 --> 14:06.578
What else would you expect
from Tiffany's?

14:06.580 --> 14:08.980
Tiffany's?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.749
ALF, is this going to show up
on the 6 o'clock news?

14:11.751 --> 14:13.718
No, no, it's legit.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.587
Look, here's the receipt.

14:15.589 --> 14:19.090
Yup, that's my
credit card number, alright.

14:19.092 --> 14:22.227
I'll pay you back
out of my earnings.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.964
ALF, this is entirely
too much money.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.665
Are you gonna throw
a hissy fit

14:27.667 --> 14:31.870
every time I squander
a few thousand bucks?

14:31.872 --> 14:34.706
Now, you listen to me, that
is exactly the sort of thinking

14:34.708 --> 14:38.743
that's going to lose us
that $20,000 just like that!

14:38.745 --> 14:41.112
$10,000. Pass the cake.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.148
Come again.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.317
Oh, didn't I tell ya?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.353
We lost half our money.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.990
Hey, Willie, honey, babe.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.293
It's just a temporary setback.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.830
Don't you Willie-honey-babe me.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.365
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.934
Uh, we are getting out
of the stock market,<i> right now.</i>

15:02.936 --> 15:05.937
I'm gonna take that money,
I'm gonna put it in the bank.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.006
The bank? Kate!

15:08.008 --> 15:10.141
Talk some sense into the man!

15:10.143 --> 15:13.311
I'm talking swimming pools,
movie stars

15:13.313 --> 15:16.147
black gold, Texas tea.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.718
- No, he's right, ALF.
- Sure, Kate.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.389
Take this pin and stab me
in the back with it.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.925
Dad, isn't it only fair
that ALF's entitled

15:26.927 --> 15:29.761
to share in some of the profit?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.529
You were always my favorite.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.165
You should listen to her more.
She's in college now.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.868
- Yep.
- Granted, it's a party school.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.406
Okay, ALF,
here's what I'll do.

15:41.408 --> 15:45.410
I'll give you $2500.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.112
And can I keep investing?

15:48.114 --> 15:51.316
- It's your money, ALF.
- Yeah?

15:51.318 --> 15:56.721
What if I were to run it up to,
say, oh, $4,000,000?

15:56.723 --> 15:59.757
I'll just have to
live with that, every day

15:59.759 --> 16:02.293
for the rest of my life.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.829
And I'll be there to remind you.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.302
[instrumental music]

16:13.606 --> 16:15.206
[sighs]

16:15.208 --> 16:16.674
Alright, alright.

16:16.676 --> 16:20.144
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.113
I'm gonna be okay.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.549
Just a setback.

16:24.551 --> 16:28.553
One huge, spiraling setback.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.422
- Hi, ALF.
- Brian will you calm down?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.791
And tell your twin
to do the same.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.295
But I'm all alone.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.630
- Are you okay?
- Everything's fine.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.633
Uh, I'm just having problems
with my motor skills.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.404
I've been drinking coffee,
but it's not helping.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.406
Uh, come over here.
I need your help.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.275
So, what do you want me to do?

16:51.277 --> 16:54.078
I want you to check
my portfolio balance.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.747
Just push the enter button

16:55.749 --> 16:59.717
stand back,
and whatever happens, stay calm.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.326
Please blink.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.896
There's no time.

17:11.898 --> 17:15.400
Uh, say, Bri..

17:15.402 --> 17:17.602
What, uh, what happens
to all that money

17:17.604 --> 17:19.570
Grandma Dorothy
keeps giving you?

17:19.572 --> 17:21.839
- Where is it?
- It's in the bank.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.342
But I can't get it
without her being with me.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.878
Well, no problem,
we'll go to the bank together.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.814
- I look like her.
- It won't work, ALF.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.884
You're right.
She has more facial hair.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.387
New idea,
how about you getting me

17:36.389 --> 17:38.322
your father's
automatic-teller card

17:38.324 --> 17:40.158
and his code number?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.960
- I can't do that.
- Sure you can.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.630
Just start out
by talking about the weather

17:45.632 --> 17:47.799
then you tell him
what a great dancer he is

17:47.801 --> 17:50.835
then you casually work it
into the conversation.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.471
ALF, I've never seen you
this desperate.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.973
Desperate?
I'll show you desperate!

17:55.975 --> 17:57.675
Get me that code number!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.744
- I want that code--
- ALF!

18:02.248 --> 18:04.749
Why were you shaking Brian?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.684
If you must know,
I was helping him

18:06.686 --> 18:09.353
with his
Katharine Hepburn impression.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.222
Now, repeat after me, Brian..

18:11.224 --> 18:14.392
[imitates Katherine Hepburn]
You're my knight
in shining armor.

18:14.394 --> 18:18.029
My knight in shining armor.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.497
[sighs]

18:21.201 --> 18:24.402
[instrumental music]

18:30.310 --> 18:32.210
- See ALF?
- Yes.

18:32.212 --> 18:36.314
He was teaching our son
Katharine Hepburn impressions.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.982
And you were worried.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.890
What are you all looking at?

18:45.892 --> 18:49.594
Haven't you ever seen
a pot of coffee before?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.529
ALF, put the coffee pot down.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.598
Oh, you'd all like that,
wouldn't you?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.099
[laughs]

18:55.101 --> 19:00.304
Don't worry, Joe. We're in this
together. When I say run, run.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.006
ALF, why don't you..

19:02.008 --> 19:05.843
Why don't you go upstairs
and rest? For a week.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.946
We'll, uh, we'll entertain
your little friend.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.548
His name's Joe.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.117
Hey, Willie.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.685
Hey, handsome.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.654
Great weather we're having, huh?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.723
I understand
you're quite a dancer.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.591
What was your
bank code number again?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.426
- ALF--
- You're right, I'll guess.

19:22.428 --> 19:23.794
It'll be more fun.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.530
- One, one, one, one.
- ALF..

19:25.532 --> 19:27.265
- One, one, one, two.
- ALF!

19:27.267 --> 19:29.433
- One, one, one, three.
- ALF, stop!

19:29.435 --> 19:32.003
That's it? Good. I thought
we were gonna be here all night!

19:32.005 --> 19:34.572
Give me your wallet.
I'll be back in half an hour.

19:34.574 --> 19:38.543
No wallet. You lost your share
of the money, didn't you?

19:38.545 --> 19:41.312
Willie, I need to make
one more buy.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.680
I know I can turn this around.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.815
- I just need a grand.
- No.

19:44.817 --> 19:48.586
A hundred. One lousy
hundred stinking dollars

19:48.588 --> 19:50.321
ALF, yo-you're foaming.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.991
You don't understand.
I can make us all rich!

19:53.993 --> 19:57.562
Rich, do you hear me?
I'm talking Donald Trump rich!

19:57.564 --> 20:00.398
Malcolm Forbes rich.
Buddy Rich!

20:00.400 --> 20:04.702
I need money. Money! Ha!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.604
- It's over, ALF.
- No!

20:06.606 --> 20:09.340
- No, no, no.
- Dad, do something.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.975
- No, no--
- Get a hold of yourself.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.412
- No, no, no.
- ALF, ALF, ALF!

20:14.414 --> 20:15.680
I'm done.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.684
Sorry. I didn't wanna
have to do that.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.419
Nah, don't worry about it.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.989
You know what happened,
don't you?

20:24.991 --> 20:27.325
I have a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.729
Some people are blinded
by the thirst for money

20:31.731 --> 20:34.966
and it makes them lose
their values an-and go crazy

20:34.968 --> 20:38.236
and do things they shouldn't do.

20:38.238 --> 20:41.973
That explains
"Ghostbusters II."

20:41.975 --> 20:45.376
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.144
Your father's quite a guy.

20:47.146 --> 20:52.016
It took a big man to rough up
a defenseless three-foot alien.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.253
Welcome back, ALF.
We were worried about you.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.621
Thanks.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.491
Hey, come on, you big lug.

21:03.730 --> 21:07.865
Well, I guess
I'm still a tad keyed up.

21:07.867 --> 21:11.836
So if you guys need me, I'll be
out re-tarring the driveway.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.404
Give me back my wallet.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.574
Must have lost my touch.

21:20.213 --> 21:22.780
[instrumental music]

21:26.619 --> 21:28.386
- Willie?
- Yeah, ALF.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.987
Listen, I've been wondering

21:29.989 --> 21:33.324
how come you came out of this
with $7500

21:33.326 --> 21:35.293
and I came out with bupkus?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.295
But I'm not challenging you.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.763
Well, ALF, I had a feeling

21:38.765 --> 21:40.698
you were going to
not challenge me on this.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.933
So, uh, I'll tell you what.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.202
If what you've cost me
over the years

21:45.204 --> 21:47.938
turns out to be less than
what you've made me

21:47.940 --> 21:51.175
then I'm gonna give you
the difference.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.677
I've made a list.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.812
Ha! What a maroon. Go ahead.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.248
Punch the key. Punch it.
Go ahead, punch it.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.650
Punch the key.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.520
You can't count when
I crashed into your garage.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.021
I didn't even know you then!

22:04.023 --> 22:06.490
It counts, ALF.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.260
Well, you can't count
the first kitchen fire.

22:09.262 --> 22:10.828
Is it my fault
you have outlets

22:10.830 --> 22:14.398
that won't support
30 appliances?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.634
It's your fault. It counts.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.604
"Bail money?"

22:20.606 --> 22:23.641
Why do I get charged
with<i> your</i> bail money?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.876
You got me arrested.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.345
Oh, yeah, right.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.547
[laughs]

22:30.683 --> 22:33.684
Oh! Oh, these are all
great memories!

22:33.686 --> 22:36.253
How come we don't have pictures
of this stuff?

22:36.255 --> 22:38.189
You broke my camera.

22:38.191 --> 22:41.859
Oh, right. Why don't you just
put it on my tab?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.394
It's there!

22:43.396 --> 22:47.898
Right above,
"One scratched crystal vase."

22:47.900 --> 22:49.567
You're so retentive.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.474
[theme music]

23:16.396 --> 23:19.597
[music continues]

23:20.266 --> 23:22.967
[ALF laughs]
