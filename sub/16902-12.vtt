00:02.969 --> 00:05.171
Are you sure you don't want to
go to a real restaurant?

00:05.171 --> 00:07.605
No! This food cart is great!

00:13.780 --> 00:15.382
Look at this guy.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.517
He used to be a man once.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.885
What is that supposed to mean?

00:18.885 --> 00:20.409
Don't you want what he has someday?

00:20.553 --> 00:22.316
A family, a wife, children?

00:27.660 --> 00:29.329
Lemon... You're a woman.

00:29.329 --> 00:30.830
Of course I am. That doctor was a quack.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.491
I don't even know why
my parents listened to him.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.897
I need advice.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.104
Elisa is coming by this afternoon to, uh...

00:38.104 --> 00:39.105
talk about us.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.141
Oh... Ladies are such a bummer.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.276
Where is this going? How serious are we?

00:43.276 --> 00:45.512
Why don't you listen to my story about my friend?

00:45.512 --> 00:49.282
Well, where is it going? Ladies like
to know what that next step is. They...

00:49.282 --> 00:51.751
We can't help ourselves.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.920
Oh, believe me, Lemon,
I want to take that next step.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.188
You mean like marriage?

00:55.188 --> 00:56.389
No, the one before that.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.658
Moving in together? That's huge.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.751
No, the thing you do before that.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.319
Think you in the mid '90s.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.165
You haven't had sex?

01:05.165 --> 01:06.299
Sh!

01:06.299 --> 01:07.567
Elisa had a very strict,

01:07.567 --> 01:10.127
very religious upbringing.
She does not take that step lightly.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.871
We have, of course...

01:14.007 --> 01:15.075
pleasured one another.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.743
No. Stop. I will leave.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.906
But she wants me to make some kind
of commitment before we go forward.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.115
Obviously, I care about her a lot.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.451
But she keeps confusing me
with this ridiculous notion that,

01:24.451 --> 01:26.753
uh, sex and love are somehow connected.

01:26.753 --> 01:27.854
Okay, two things.

01:27.854 --> 01:28.888
One, be honest.

01:28.888 --> 01:32.415
If this is a big deal to her,
do not take that next step unless you are sure.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.061
And second, and more importantly,

01:35.128 --> 01:39.189
in 2009, I have done it
two more times than you!

01:39.299 --> 01:41.631
Give it up! What, what!

01:41.901 --> 01:43.436
Whoo!

01:43.436 --> 01:44.835
Do not leave a brother hanging!

01:46.473 --> 01:47.565
Whoo!

02:11.297 --> 02:13.595
Hey, uh... You ready for
Larry King Live tonight?

02:13.666 --> 02:15.768
You know it. I cursed for three hours straight

02:15.768 --> 02:17.929
just to get it out of my system, you dumb bitch.

02:18.771 --> 02:19.772
Oh, no.

02:19.772 --> 02:20.773
Listen, we have a request.

02:20.773 --> 02:24.310
Can you please try to remember
to talk about T.G.S. tonight?

02:24.310 --> 02:28.542
You only have to plug it once.
T.G.S. Fridays at 10:30 on N.B.C.

02:28.615 --> 02:32.719
You got it. "N.G.S. " Fridays
at "C-30" on "T. B. 10".

02:32.719 --> 02:33.920
Thank you.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.625
Well, it says you're calling me.

02:38.625 --> 02:39.887
How is that possible? Hello?

02:40.193 --> 02:43.856
This phone was left in my cab by a
woman wearing the shirt of a man.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.431
Oh. You left your phone in his car.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.066
Hi, I'm Liz.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.201
You have my phone?

02:48.201 --> 02:49.566
Yes. This is Asif.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.667
I am at Queens Taxi dispatch
in Long Island City. You come.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.340
Yes.
I will. Thank you.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.341
Hey.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.242
Why do you have Tracy Jordan's
phone number in your address book?

02:58.611 --> 03:01.214
I work with him.
If you want, I could bring a signed photo.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.316
You bring me $800, rich lady.

03:03.316 --> 03:04.784
Or I throw the phone away.

03:04.784 --> 03:05.885
What?

03:05.885 --> 03:09.088
Oh. Yeah. I'll definitely do that.
On "Opposite Day".

03:09.088 --> 03:12.421
I'm new to this country. Is that a real thing?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.396
Hi, baby.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.399
I got you something to
remember me while I'm in Puerto Rico.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.568
It's a caricature of me on a skateboard.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.603
So, I guess you're still
planning on taking your trip?

03:23.603 --> 03:27.240
Well, I've been going home every
winter for the last 15 years.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.409
I guess I could consider staying...

03:29.409 --> 03:31.444
if I knew where this was going.

03:31.444 --> 03:35.014
And the woman talk begins.
Well played. Look, you know...

03:35.014 --> 03:37.244
...I'm serious about us. We're great together.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.719
We're Jack and Elisa. "Jalisa".

03:40.753 --> 03:41.879
That's really lame, Jack.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.457
Yeah, that was just a joke.

03:44.457 --> 03:46.626
I don't want to get all Marc Anthony on you.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.685
But I need to know how you feel.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.194
I love you.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.861
I love you.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.864
I love you too, Jack Donaghy.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.093
Then you'll stay?

03:58.271 --> 03:59.839
Okay, I'll stay.

03:59.839 --> 04:03.743
But if I have to give up my trip,
then I want us to spend that time together.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.778
Just us. "Jalisa".

04:05.778 --> 04:07.245
Jonathan?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.383
Clear my schedule for next week,
starting with tonight.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.714
You won't be coming in at all?

04:11.818 --> 04:13.286
But what about "Jackonathan"?

04:13.286 --> 04:17.557
I think tonight is going to be a very special night.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.625
If you know what I mean.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.716
I think I do.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.553
Don't forget your skateboard.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.832
But then, he scores a basket,
even though he's not a wolf anymore.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.300
We're here with Tracy Jordan,

04:27.300 --> 04:28.768
who just recounted, by the way,

04:28.768 --> 04:31.304
the entire plot of the movie "Teen Wolf".

04:31.304 --> 04:32.572
What?

04:32.572 --> 04:33.664
Oh, hold on, Tracy.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.534
My producers are telling
me there is breaking news.

04:36.609 --> 04:41.137
The Asian financial markets have
just opened to a huge sell-off.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.816
And we're going to switch to that story right now.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.545
Good. I'm glad I'm here.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.420
Your thoughts, Tracy Jordan, on

04:47.420 --> 04:49.589
how this is going to impact Wall Street.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.391
Larry, I'm not an expert.

04:51.391 --> 04:52.859
But I do have a strong opinion.

04:52.859 --> 04:56.556
New York as we know it
will no longer exist tomorrow.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.031
Expand on that.

04:58.031 --> 05:01.262
Look. I grew up here, Larry.
In the days before Starbuck.

05:01.534 --> 05:06.272
And if Wall Street crashes,
it will be the 1 970s all over again.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.934
People will get mean. The streets won't be safe.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.344
It will be graffiti everywhere.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.346
And the movies will only cost $3.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.547
Tracy Jordan.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.345
Saying three serious things, and then, a joke.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.557
Oh. Jack. Have you taken a
gander at the Asian markets?

05:24.557 --> 05:26.592
The "CHUFFA Volatility Index" is off the charts.

05:26.592 --> 05:29.862
Well, good luck with that, Jorgenson.
But I'm on vacation now.

05:29.862 --> 05:30.988
But... I have these papers.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.266
Hey, Jack. How you doing?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.393
Like a lion ready to take its mate.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.873
How are you calling me?

05:40.873 --> 05:44.536
Ugh. I lost my phone and
this jagweed cabbie has it.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.879
Hey, stop harassing my friends, Asif.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.781
Hey... Liz...

05:48.781 --> 05:50.350
Just wanted to let you know that, uh,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.114
I found that special picture
that you took with your phone.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.388
What picture? Oh, my God.

05:55.388 --> 05:56.456
Yes.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.490
That one.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.393
There's a picture on my phone.
An adult picture. Of me.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.054
What?

06:02.228 --> 06:05.365
Drew took it as a joke.
I'm making a face like this. Like...

06:05.365 --> 06:06.491
Why am I telling you this?

06:06.599 --> 06:08.294
Top and bottom? May I speak with Asif?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.236
No.
Okay. What do you want?

06:10.236 --> 06:11.838
$2,000 cash.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.170
Or I email the picture to
everyone in your address book.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.844
Have you been to Asia, Tracy?

06:17.844 --> 06:19.545
Uh, my work has taken me there.

06:19.545 --> 06:23.106
I was supposed to be in that movie Rush Hour,
but two weeks into shooting,

06:23.216 --> 06:24.649
I was replaced by Jackie Chan.

06:24.951 --> 06:26.652
Okay. I'm going to get my phone.

06:26.652 --> 06:27.880
You're going to pay that guy?

06:28.020 --> 06:30.716
Well, you know, I need my address book and stuff.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.860
But I'm not going alone to
meet some creep at a taxi garage.

06:33.860 --> 06:34.927
Will one of you guys go with me?

06:34.927 --> 06:35.995
- No, ma'am.
- Good luck.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.096
I would, but I don't want to.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.723
I will escort you, Miss Lemon.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.662
We pages are accustomed to danger.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.269
Thank you, Kenneth. Can you leave now?
This place is in Queens.

06:43.269 --> 06:46.606
Oh, Miss Lemon, I can't
leave Manhattan on page business.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.008
N.B.C. 's insurance doesn't cover it.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.134
I'll have to do this as a friend.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.536
Okay. Fine.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.614
Say it. Say I'm your friend.

06:54.614 --> 06:55.848
Fine.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.679
You're my friend, Kenneth. Let's go.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.122
The Mumbai Stock Exchange
is now down in early trading.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.658
Is this panic becoming global?

07:05.658 --> 07:07.059
Tracy Jordan, talk us through this..

07:07.059 --> 07:11.553
Larry, what everyone needs to
do is just take a deep breath,

07:11.798 --> 07:15.598
calm down, and start preparing
their bodies for the "Thunderdome".

07:15.768 --> 07:16.894
That is the new law.

07:17.804 --> 07:19.101
That's my T.V.!

07:19.872 --> 07:23.501
This is as far as we can get by subway.
We need to find a cab.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.345
Boy, Miss Lemon.
This is a pretty bad neighborhood.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.348
Oh, I just got tagged!

07:33.586 --> 07:36.656
Ugh. Mr. Jordan and Mr. Larry King are right.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.556
New York is not safe anymore.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.227
And I am not risking your life for a cell phone.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.063
It's not just the phone, Kenneth. It's what's on it.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.566
I don't understand.
What could be so important?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.564
It wasn't something of sentimental value, was it?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.837
Yes. Very sentimental.

07:53.439 --> 07:57.671
It's... a song. A lullaby that my Nana
Lemon used to sing to me every night.

07:58.044 --> 08:01.681
Oh, was it "The Day is Done, My Sweet,
For The Lambs Have Been Decapitated"?

08:01.681 --> 08:02.815
No.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.181
It was a German song. She was German.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.520
And my Nana got very sick recently.

08:07.520 --> 08:11.081
And I went to visit her, and I had
her sing it for me one final time.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.951
I recorded that song on my phone.

08:13.092 --> 08:16.829
And I'm glad that I did, because...
she died a few hours later.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.164
It was my birthday.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.224
Miss Lemon, I am so sorry.
Would you sing it for me?

08:27.707 --> 08:28.808
Stop.

08:28.808 --> 08:33.336
Now that I know the reason we are doing
this is not only moral, but beautiful...

08:33.712 --> 08:37.376
then I will not rest until
I get my friend her phone.

08:37.582 --> 08:38.845
Okay. Come on.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.020
That was amazing.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.845
Thank you.

08:45.791 --> 08:49.158
I watched an American Masters
last night about Baryshnikov. I...

08:49.428 --> 08:51.020
picked up a couple of ideas.

08:52.598 --> 08:53.929
Our sushi.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.002
No, no, no, no, no. I'll get it.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.596
You'll need your rest.
We're going again in 15.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.112
Jack, you've got company.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.914
Jack, why aren't you answering your phones?

09:07.914 --> 09:08.915
What are you doing here?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.817
People are freaking out about this Asia thing,
and we can't find Geiss!

09:11.817 --> 09:14.615
He's AWOL.
Now everyone's looking to you, Jack.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.052
I don't care what's going on out there.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.751
I'm staying here.

09:21.928 --> 09:25.694
There are some things more important
than a stock quote crawling across a screen.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.559
I am in love with this magnificent woman.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.070
And there is no amount of money this
company could lose that would cause me to...

09:31.070 --> 09:33.038
Yes, that's the amount.
I'll get dressed right now.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.544
Bill Hewitt,
Undersecretary of the Treasury.

09:38.544 --> 09:42.281
What advice can you give our
viewers in these uncertain times?

09:42.281 --> 09:46.217
The worst thing you can do at a time
like this is to pull out your investments.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.386
Don't panic, because...

09:47.386 --> 09:49.320
Devil's avocado, here, Larry...

09:49.755 --> 09:52.087
I think people should freak the geek out!

09:52.258 --> 09:54.749
Withdraw all your money and hide it.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.562
Interesting strategy.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.086
It's what I've always done.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.299
I hide cash everywhere.

10:00.299 --> 10:03.132
At home, at church, even at work!

10:03.269 --> 10:07.006
In fact, I've hidden so much
money that if some of it was gone,

10:07.006 --> 10:08.574
I probably wouldn't even notice.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.166
Now, why would you say that?

10:10.242 --> 10:11.300
I don't know.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.008
Don't worry, Miss Lemon. I'll protect you.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.786
Oh. It's just kids.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.761
Hey!

10:28.761 --> 10:29.929
Bad young man! Shame on...

10:29.929 --> 10:32.159
What is going on with people!

10:38.404 --> 10:39.572
They took my wallet.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.273
Oh...

10:41.273 --> 10:42.642
Was this your Nana Lemon?

10:42.642 --> 10:45.543
Yeah. She's the one we're doing this for.
She's dead. Come on.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.634
Wait.

10:46.912 --> 10:48.277
Why is she wearing these glasses?

10:48.714 --> 10:51.183
This is from New Year's,
but you said she died on your birthday.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.184
That's in November.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.319
No, that's not a New Year's thing.

10:53.319 --> 10:57.380
That's the year she wanted to live to.
She didn't make it.

10:58.057 --> 10:59.684
Sing that lullaby again.

11:04.797 --> 11:05.855
Keep going.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.429
I knew it!

11:10.670 --> 11:12.331
That's "99 Red Balloons".

11:12.571 --> 11:15.274
Nena's famous anti-balloon protest song.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.375
You lied to me.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.411
Yeah. All right. I lied. So what?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.579
You want the truth, Kenneth?
You want the truth?

11:20.579 --> 11:21.981
I can't handle the truth!

11:21.981 --> 11:25.317
There is an adult
picture of me on that phone!

11:25.317 --> 11:26.452
Adult?

11:26.452 --> 11:28.688
You mean, like, you're
driving a car or wearing a suit?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.790
It's a boobies picture, Kenneth!

11:30.790 --> 11:34.317
And I only kept it because, for once,
they were both pointing in the same direction!

11:34.627 --> 11:36.829
I knew you wouldn't help
me if I told you the truth.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.262
So you lied to me?

11:38.597 --> 11:40.399
That's not something that
friends do to each other.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.234
Well, then, maybe we're not friends!

11:42.234 --> 11:44.637
But we are. You said so before we left.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.127
You made me say that!

11:46.672 --> 11:47.969
Oh.

11:48.774 --> 11:52.710
Well, then, I guess I'm here as a page,
and in violation of N.B.C. 's insurance policy.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.576
I should probably head back to Manhattan.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.241
Good!

11:59.785 --> 12:03.744
I don't need you! Co- worker!

12:13.332 --> 12:14.467
Did you get a hold of Geiss?

12:14.467 --> 12:15.468
No.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.569
Did you try his mistress?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.570
Not there.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
How about his "manstress"?

12:18.571 --> 12:22.374
Nothing. I think we should
listen to Tracy Jordan and panic, sir.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.375
What?

12:23.375 --> 12:26.679
I'm saying the "Disneyfication"
of New York is over, everyone.

12:26.679 --> 12:27.980
At the stroke of midnight,

12:27.980 --> 12:32.542
your Lexus is going to turn back into a hot
pile of rats fighting over a human finger.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.688
Joining us on the phone is G.E.
Vice President, Jack Donaghy.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.623
Jack, what's your outlook on all of this?

12:37.623 --> 12:39.792
I just want to preach caution, Larry.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.886
If there were anything to worry about,
I would be at my office...

12:42.962 --> 12:48.067
instead of at home right now with my...
beautiful girlfriend. She's Latin.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.068
Expand on that.

12:49.068 --> 12:52.037
Look, my point is that some of
the things that Tracy is saying

12:52.037 --> 12:53.339
are just fanning the flames.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.340
Hang on.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.241
I know Jack Donaghy. And that is an impostor.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.278
Hang up! Hang up on him, Larry!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.610
I'm going to. But not because you told me.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.308
Lincoln,
Nebraska, you are on the air.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.154
So is this what you'd rather be
doing instead of spending time with me?

13:09.155 --> 13:10.923
It smells like dude in here.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.958
I tried to call you. Why didn't you pick up?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.660
Because I'm sick of listening to you.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.763
"Oh I love you, Elisa."

13:17.763 --> 13:20.699
This was all just another Jack Donaghy lie.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.169
Like when you said you could dunk a basketball?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.970
I can on a regulation hoop.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.273
Look, this is an emergency.
If I'm not here tonight...

13:27.273 --> 13:28.307
What?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.308
What's going to happen?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.342
People are going to die?

13:30.342 --> 13:31.443
No.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.712
You'll all just get poor like the rest of us.

13:33.712 --> 13:35.781
You'll eat cereal that comes in a bag,

13:35.781 --> 13:38.217
and you'll keep the free
hand wipes from the casino.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.549
You might even have to spend
some time with your children.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.289
Who is this woman? Why
isn't someone shutting her up?

13:43.289 --> 13:46.826
Uh... Uh, why don't you
just go back to my apartment,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.659
and I will meet you there? "E"... Eventually.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.601
Don't worry about it. I'm going to Puerto Rico!

13:55.601 --> 13:57.102
Elisa, don't do that. You don't understand.

13:57.102 --> 13:59.972
What's happening here is a
once in a lifetime thing.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.496
So am I.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.212
Boy, that was kind of neat how she just...

14:06.212 --> 14:08.681
woop... flipped your words
around on you there.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.909
Sorry.

14:12.384 --> 14:15.254
Forget it. We're never
going to find Tracy's money.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.589
There's something under here!

14:18.791 --> 14:21.827
Oh... It's nothing but a bunch of tarantula food.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.590
What? I didn't even know Tracy had a tarantula.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.398
You know what? There's an easier way to do this.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.937
Our next caller is Pete from Manhattan.
Pete, what's your question?

14:31.937 --> 14:34.340
Hey Larry. First time caller.
Adore the show.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.609
Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere, Larry!

14:36.609 --> 14:38.873
That's my friend, Peter Frampton, on the phone!

14:38.944 --> 14:40.172
Uh... sure.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.648
Listen, Tracy. I love the
idea of hiding cash at work.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.084
Can you be more specific
about where you hid your money?

14:45.084 --> 14:46.619
Of course, Pete!

14:46.619 --> 14:49.816
I hid my money in the safest place at 30 Rock.

14:50.222 --> 14:54.994
Without giving it away,
the place I picked is very dry and warm.

14:54.994 --> 14:58.364
Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.433
And although the location changes all the time,

15:01.433 --> 15:03.833
the money stays in the same place.

15:04.203 --> 15:07.106
If you're just joining us,
we're with Tracy Jordan,

15:07.106 --> 15:12.578
who is giving guitar icon Peter Frampton
enigmatic clues about a secret treasure.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.738
Stay with us.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.976
Mr. Donaghy. This just arrived.
It's from Mr. Geiss.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.323
Everything's going to be alright. Geiss is back.

15:24.323 --> 15:26.191
Jonathan? Can we even play this thing?

15:26.191 --> 15:29.319
Oh, yes. I keep a V.C.R.
so I can watch your old football tapes.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.432
Jonathan, what is that camcorder for?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.024
Nothing. I don't know.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.830
Hello.

15:40.906 --> 15:42.007
If you are watching this,

15:42.007 --> 15:45.778
you are an executive of the
General Electric Corporation

15:45.778 --> 15:48.347
and the unthinkable is happening.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.882
Capitalism is ending,

15:49.882 --> 15:54.319
either because of the Soviets or
something ridiculous like a woman President.

15:54.586 --> 15:55.721
God, he looks so young.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.757
I'm speaking to you in the year 1987,

15:58.757 --> 16:00.554
but my message is timeless.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.893
Avoid... the Noid.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.665
We've all worked hard, but now, it's over.

16:06.665 --> 16:11.625
There's only one thing for you to do.
Go to your loved ones.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.272
Hold them close.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.833
Because in the end... and if you're watching this,

16:17.309 --> 16:19.445
it is the end...

16:19.445 --> 16:22.243
Iove is all that matters.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.841
Now, how am I going to turn this damn thing off?

16:27.186 --> 16:28.710
What's that gizmo?

16:41.667 --> 16:42.929
Elisa?

16:43.569 --> 16:45.637
I was about to do the
whole run to the airport thing,

16:45.637 --> 16:48.401
Iike Ross did on Friends
and Liz Lemon did in real life.

16:48.707 --> 16:49.696
What are you doing here?

16:49.842 --> 16:54.313
The taxis want $500
to go to J.F.K. and the buses are worse.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.582
Everything's gone cocoa for "cuckoo-poops".

16:56.582 --> 16:57.750
Is that right?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.618
Elisa, listen to me.

16:59.618 --> 17:02.521
I meant everything I said,
but I know that that's just words.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.615
You want commitment? Here it is...

17:05.790 --> 17:07.053
Let's get married.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.193
Jack.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.528
I love you, Elisa.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.296
And I don't want to be with anyone else.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.723
Okay.

17:15.300 --> 17:19.964
But I want a ring so big
that it gives me back problems.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.380
That's my phone. I'm Liz Lemon.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.715
Where's the $2,000?

17:29.715 --> 17:33.981
I don't have it. I lost all my money
and my bank cards and my retainer. Geez.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.455
Please, Asif. Give me my phone.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.223
Maybe you could call a friend to get the money.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.750
Oh, wait. Every number in this
address book is a work number.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.963
Work number, work number, work number...

17:44.963 --> 17:46.225
You have no friends.

17:47.032 --> 17:49.830
Yes. I. Am.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.103
Okay.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.004
You have $2,000?

17:54.306 --> 17:55.273
No.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.338
I'm going to watch T.V.
until you come up with my money.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.779
Maybe you'll get it through sex trade.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.337
You are a very pretty, young thing.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.383
You're disgusting.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.577
I'm not talking to you.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.521
Frank, calm down!
It's not in here!

18:11.690 --> 18:14.760
This isn't about the money!
This is about my own issues with Liz!

18:14.760 --> 18:15.794
Stop it!

18:15.794 --> 18:18.197
We have Peter Frampton on the phone again.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.232
Come on, Tracy.
Just tell us where the money is.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.434
Where's the safest place in 30 Rock?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.535
Is that Pete?

18:23.535 --> 18:26.004
I already told you. It's dry and warm.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.807
Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft.

18:28.807 --> 18:31.343
And although the location changes...

18:31.343 --> 18:33.846
...it's always in the same place.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.914
There's nothing like that in 30 Rock!

18:35.914 --> 18:36.915
Nothing!

18:36.915 --> 18:38.780
I never said it was a thing.

18:39.651 --> 18:44.554
It's me. I am the safest place in 30 Rock.

18:58.437 --> 19:01.770
I would thank you to give
the lady its cell phone back.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.945
Thank you for coming back, Kenneth.
You're a good friend.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.013
You mean it?

19:08.013 --> 19:09.014
Yes.

19:09.014 --> 19:12.151
Because I'm having an asbestos removal
party at my apartment on Sunday. And...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.948
Yeah, I'm in.

19:14.553 --> 19:18.524
Now that the U.S. markets have
opened unaffected by the Asian meltdown,

19:18.524 --> 19:22.194
many people are blaming the panic
in New York last night on one man.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.163
Tracy Jordan. He is here with me now.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.200
Tracy, a lot of people are calling you
a "fearmonger". And, I am quoting here,

19:28.200 --> 19:29.268
"an idiot".

19:29.268 --> 19:30.602
What do you have to say for yourself?

19:30.602 --> 19:34.333
Watch T.G.S. Fridays at
10:30 on N.B.C.! Word!

19:36.341 --> 19:37.342
Morning, Jonathan.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.311
Good morning, sir. Crazy night last night.

19:39.311 --> 19:41.547
Lots of emotions. People getting carried away.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.549
Yes, it was a crazy night.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.017
Uh, is Elisa here?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.019
We're having a couples' spa day.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.555
She came by earlier.
She asked me to give you this.

19:49.555 --> 19:51.750
She said to just press "play".

19:57.129 --> 20:00.566
Hi, Jack. I'm on my way to Puerto Rico.

20:00.566 --> 20:05.799
I'm sorry. Yesterday was crazy.
Lots of emotion.

20:07.005 --> 20:10.202
I think maybe you asked me
what you asked me out of panic.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.346
So... I'm going to go see my family and...

20:14.346 --> 20:17.281
give us both a chance to think about everything.

20:18.383 --> 20:19.941
Okay. I'll call you.

20:20.452 --> 20:22.154
Adios, mi amor.

20:22.154 --> 20:26.113
Now, how do you turn this damn thing off?

20:29.995 --> 20:32.793
No! That's personal.
