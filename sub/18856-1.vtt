<i>Welcome back to SPEN
Sports for another episode of</i>

00:35.900 --> 00:39.971
Are They Still Cool?
Surf Edition.

00:40.004 --> 00:43.007
<i>Cody Maverick was set
to become the biggest surfer</i>

00:43.040 --> 00:46.678
<i>to come out of Pen Gu
since Big Z Topanga.</i>

00:46.711 --> 00:49.581
<i>He shocked and awed
fans and critics alike</i>

00:49.614 --> 00:51.916
<i>with his fresh,
new-school moves.</i>

00:51.949 --> 00:55.153
<i>He scorched nine-time champion
and local bully</i>

00:55.187 --> 00:58.656
<i>Tank "The Shredder" Evans
and was perfectly positioned</i>

00:58.690 --> 01:00.659
<i>to win the tenth annual</i>

01:00.692 --> 01:02.661
<i>Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.</i>

01:02.693 --> 01:04.596
Oh, I'm doing great, man.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.598
I think I earned a lot
of respect out there.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.166
After I win today,

01:08.200 --> 01:10.136
You're gonna see
a lot more from me.

01:10.168 --> 01:11.971
I promise.
I'm going to the Outer Banks

01:12.003 --> 01:14.873
to surf with the Hang 5,
the best in the business.

01:14.906 --> 01:17.443
It's been my dream since
I was a little kid and...

01:17.476 --> 01:19.812
Heh, heh! it's finally
about to come true.

01:19.845 --> 01:21.747
<i>Victory, fame and fortune</i>

01:21.780 --> 01:24.516
<i>were all but guaranteed
for young Cody Maverick.</i>

01:24.550 --> 01:26.518
<i>Until at the last minute,</i>

01:26.551 --> 01:28.553
<i>he chose to protect
his friend Chicken Joe</i>

01:28.587 --> 01:30.589
<i>from sore loser Tank Evans,</i>

01:30.622 --> 01:32.891
<i>and gave up any chance
of the trophy.</i>

01:32.925 --> 01:35.694
<i>Chicken Joe took home
first place that day</i>

01:35.727 --> 01:37.430
<i>and has since gained great fame</i>

01:37.462 --> 01:39.197
<i>in the world of
professional surfing.</i>

01:39.230 --> 01:42.467
<i>Maverick, however,
has been all but forgotten.</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:44.937
<i>Let's see what he's
been up to in this episode of</i>

01:44.970 --> 01:47.940
Are They Still Cool?
Surf Edition.

02:20.838 --> 02:22.807
So, Cody, why
don't you fill us in

02:22.840 --> 02:24.909
on what you've done the last
few years.

02:24.943 --> 02:27.546
First, I have
a question for you.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.814
I, uh... Okay, go ahead.

02:29.848 --> 02:31.649
Have you or someone
you care about

02:31.683 --> 02:33.953
expressed the urge
to ride waves like a pro?

02:33.986 --> 02:36.221
- To be the master of the ocean?
- Come again?

02:36.255 --> 02:39.825
Well, I can show you how it's
done at the Pen Gu Surf Academy.

02:39.857 --> 02:42.827
At PSA, we got all the newest,
sickest moves

02:42.861 --> 02:45.631
at the lowest prices.
You want backflips?

02:45.664 --> 02:47.232
You got it.

02:47.266 --> 02:49.969
Tail rides? Ugh! Hah!
You got it.

02:50.001 --> 02:52.570
Tube slides? Wha-ha!
You bet you got it.

02:52.604 --> 02:55.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
We're trying to do a show here.

02:55.641 --> 02:58.010
You can't just plug your
surf school in our interview.

02:58.042 --> 03:01.846

and co-founder of PSA,

money on those losers.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.995
Oh, what now?

03:16.028 --> 03:18.130
You should learn to surf
from a real master.

03:18.162 --> 03:19.497
Right, gang?

03:19.498 --> 03:20.832
Yes, sensei.

03:20.866 --> 03:23.869
Hi. I'm nine-time champion,
Tank Evans

03:23.902 --> 03:26.772
and I want you to discover
your surf success story

03:26.804 --> 03:28.807
at Tank's Online Surf Institute.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.176
Just send me your parents'
credit card information.

03:31.208 --> 03:34.612
Cut it out, Tank! We're trying
to film a commercial here.

03:34.646 --> 03:36.148
No, we're not.

03:36.181 --> 03:38.784
How can you promise these
squirts you'll turn them

03:38.816 --> 03:41.687
into winners when you've never
won anything in your life?

03:41.719 --> 03:43.021
Look at all my trophies.

03:43.054 --> 03:45.857
Each more spectacular
than the last.

03:45.891 --> 03:49.227
Tank, my arms are getting tired.

03:49.261 --> 03:51.931
Fight through the pain.
It's part of your training.

04:01.672 --> 04:03.675

04:03.708 --> 04:06.711
I'll also teach you
about teamwork

04:08.030 --> 04:09.314
and proper surf etiquette!

04:09.348 --> 04:10.566
Okay, cut.

04:10.567 --> 04:11.784
Wait, stop. Stop!

04:11.816 --> 04:13.785
I am so getting fired for this.

04:13.819 --> 04:15.237
Come on.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.089
Whoa, hey, wait. Hold on.

04:18.122 --> 04:20.858
I wanna tell you about
my franchising opportunities.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.795
With purchase!

04:22.828 --> 04:23.828
Ugh!

04:32.371 --> 04:34.106
Cody?

04:35.239 --> 04:37.141
Cody?

04:37.175 --> 04:39.278
Wake up, bro.

04:39.311 --> 04:41.647
It's me.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.715
Cock-a-doodle-dude!

04:43.749 --> 04:45.284
Chicken Joe.

04:45.316 --> 04:47.653
Or as my Spanish friends
call me,

04:47.686 --> 04:50.923
El Pollo Loco.

04:50.956 --> 04:54.126
So what made you
come back to Pen Gu Island?

04:54.158 --> 04:56.661
Oh, you know,
I haven't seen my buddies

04:56.694 --> 04:58.230
Cody and Lani
in, like, two years.

04:58.263 --> 05:01.000
And I finally got some time off
from my world tour,

05:01.033 --> 05:04.003
so I thought I'd stop by
and hang out.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.838
Time off from your tour?

05:05.871 --> 05:09.175
Aren't you supposed to be
in Madagascar right now?

05:10.708 --> 05:14.412
Oh, man.
I gotta text my manager.

05:18.716 --> 05:20.385
Oh, wait.

05:20.419 --> 05:22.988
This is just a regular clam.

05:23.021 --> 05:26.057
Oh, I missed you, bro.

05:26.090 --> 05:29.293
Look at you, man.
Bigtime pro surfer now.

05:29.326 --> 05:31.129
I dig that wetsuit.

05:31.162 --> 05:33.297
Yeah? Thanks.

05:33.331 --> 05:36.167
It's a little tight around
my nuggets and tenders.

05:38.770 --> 05:41.774
But my sponsors
like me to wear it, so...

05:42.441 --> 05:44.410
Dude, you have sponsors?

05:44.442 --> 05:46.844
Totally.
They like to give me

05:46.877 --> 05:49.814
tons of free stuff.
Boards, wetsuits, wax.

05:49.848 --> 05:51.917
It's kind of a sweet deal.

05:51.949 --> 05:54.752
Heh! Yeah,
sounds pretty rad.

05:54.785 --> 05:58.023
Oh, it is, bro.
And I owe it all to you.

05:58.055 --> 06:00.792
If you hadn't saved my life
and let me win

06:00.826 --> 06:03.429
the Big Z Memorial,
I'd never be where I am today.

06:03.461 --> 06:06.798
Heck, you'd probably be
the one with all the sponsors

06:06.831 --> 06:09.201
and endorsements.
Surfing on the tour,

06:09.234 --> 06:11.170
being on TV, screaming fans...

06:11.203 --> 06:13.806
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it. I get it.

06:13.838 --> 06:16.675
I'm happy for you, Joe.
You deserve it.

06:17.809 --> 06:20.446
Uh, hey, Cody,
I picked this up for you

06:20.478 --> 06:21.746
while I was on tour.

06:21.747 --> 06:23.014
Oh, thanks, Joe.

06:23.047 --> 06:26.751
I know how much you like
these super buff penguins.

06:26.785 --> 06:28.921
Wow, the Hang 5.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.055
Those guys rule.
Did you surf with them

06:31.088 --> 06:32.257
or something?

06:32.258 --> 06:33.425
Nah. I just missed them.

06:33.458 --> 06:36.729
You know those guys. They're
always traveling the world,

06:36.761 --> 06:39.430
looking for the next
mondo extreme challenge.

06:39.463 --> 06:41.934
Too crazy for me.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.334
- Chicken Joe?
- Chicken Joe!

06:43.367 --> 06:44.769
Penguin Lani!

06:44.802 --> 06:46.020
It's so good to see you.

06:50.074 --> 06:52.211
Chicken Joe, can
you teach us your moves?

06:52.244 --> 06:53.879
You're the awesome-est!

06:53.912 --> 06:55.881
Yeah, we wanna learn from you.

06:55.913 --> 06:59.050
Can you give us a celebrity
guest surf lesson?

06:59.083 --> 07:02.286
Yeah, I'd be happy to.
Let's get started right now.

07:02.319 --> 07:05.724
Find me some tacos.

07:06.525 --> 07:09.227
The Hang 5.

07:24.843 --> 07:26.879
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm trying to see.

07:26.912 --> 07:28.063
Come on, buddy.

07:28.064 --> 07:29.214
Cody Maverick,

07:29.247 --> 07:32.283
I am not spending my whole
entire vacation

07:32.316 --> 07:33.635
chasing after you.

07:33.636 --> 07:34.953
Mom, it's the Hang 5.

07:34.985 --> 07:38.256
I've gotta be in the front.
Wow!

07:43.961 --> 07:46.564
Ladies and gentle penguins,

07:46.598 --> 07:49.867
it's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.804
Behold the most extreme team,

07:52.838 --> 07:55.273
surfing the earth
and living the dream.

07:55.307 --> 07:58.576
Coming to you live in overdrive.

07:58.610 --> 08:02.915
Put them together for
the Hang 5.

08:02.948 --> 08:05.317
Yeah!
Hang 5! Hang 5! Hang 5!

08:05.350 --> 08:09.588
He's the big kahuna,
the leader of the crew-a.

08:09.621 --> 08:12.224
The mammal with a plan...

08:12.256 --> 08:14.393
Mr. McMahon.

08:14.425 --> 08:15.993
Yeah!

08:16.026 --> 08:18.296
The king of the big-wave riders,

08:18.329 --> 08:20.531
only 50 footers or higher.

08:20.564 --> 08:23.901
To him they're just ripples,
because the H is tripled.

08:24.987 --> 08:26.037
Introducing...

08:26.071 --> 08:28.307
Hunter.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.275
Look, it's Paige!

08:30.307 --> 08:33.344
She's the best trick
surfer on the world stage.

08:33.376 --> 08:36.080
Her skill and audacity
cannot be gauged.

08:36.113 --> 08:39.015
She's beautiful, fearless
and full of rage.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.184
Let's give it up
for the one and only...

08:41.217 --> 08:43.087
- Paige.
- Paige!

08:43.121 --> 08:45.591
He's the Hang 5's enforcer.

08:45.623 --> 08:47.959
Even sharks and orcas
meet their maker

08:47.992 --> 08:49.994
when they go up against...

08:50.027 --> 08:51.313
the Undertaker.

08:51.314 --> 08:52.598
I'm Undertaker!

08:52.631 --> 08:55.400
He's hardcore times four.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.501
He lives fast, surfs hard.

08:57.535 --> 09:00.439
No regrets.
Don't call him crazy,

09:00.472 --> 09:03.976
call him... J.C.

09:05.309 --> 09:08.380
If you want some, come get some.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.887
Wow!

09:21.458 --> 09:22.543
Why the long face?

09:22.544 --> 09:23.628
Huh?

09:23.661 --> 09:26.964
No, I was just remembering
the time I met the Hang 5.

09:26.997 --> 09:28.666
I worshiped those guys.

09:28.699 --> 09:31.235
Seeing them surf
made me who I am today.

09:31.269 --> 09:32.638
I worked hard my whole life

09:32.670 --> 09:34.473
so I could be
just like them one day.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.076
And somehow it just...
It just never happened for me.

09:39.109 --> 09:41.112
I mean, I love teaching
the kids,

09:41.146 --> 09:43.482
but I didn't think
that's all I'd be doing now.

09:43.515 --> 09:46.117
I always thought
I was meant to be somebody.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.889
Doing big things,
inspiring people.

09:51.389 --> 09:53.425
I guess I was wrong.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.427
Does this have something to do

09:56.460 --> 09:58.462
with all that stuff
Tank said on the beach?

09:58.496 --> 10:02.100
Cody, you can't let
that guy mess with your head.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.235
He might have
all those trophies,

10:04.269 --> 10:06.238
but... he's still
a loser.

10:08.238 --> 10:11.075
Yeah, Tank is pretty annoying.

10:11.108 --> 10:13.311
But... it's not
just that.

10:13.344 --> 10:16.147
It's not that hard.
The secret to good surfing

10:16.180 --> 10:18.316
is you just gotta feel
the groove.

10:18.349 --> 10:19.617
Oof!

10:19.650 --> 10:21.553
Chicken Joe?

10:21.585 --> 10:23.437
Oh, I get it.

10:23.438 --> 10:25.289
Well, don't get me wrong.

10:25.323 --> 10:26.692
Don't get me wrong.
I love the guy.

10:26.724 --> 10:29.160
He deserves everything he's got,

10:29.194 --> 10:30.429
but I can't help but think,

10:30.462 --> 10:33.098
man, that could have
been me, you know?

10:33.131 --> 10:35.166
Famous, successful,

10:35.199 --> 10:38.035
a winner that everyone respects.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.005
I mean, look at him.

10:40.038 --> 10:42.007
He's even a better
teacher than me.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.075
Mm, guys, I have officially

10:44.108 --> 10:46.177
lost control of the situation.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.079
Cody? Lani?

10:49.164 --> 10:50.214
Okay, maybe not

10:50.247 --> 10:52.951
a better teacher.
We're coming, buddy.

10:54.752 --> 10:56.621
<i>What can I say? Pen Gu's home.</i>

10:56.654 --> 10:58.357
I love my life here.

10:58.390 --> 11:01.326
Sure, I'd like to travel
and see the world someday,

11:01.358 --> 11:03.627
but right now,
I got the surf school,

11:03.660 --> 11:07.265
my lifeguard job and big waves
all year round to keep me busy.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.468
It doesn't get any better
than that.

11:09.501 --> 11:13.204
Man, this teaching thing
is harder than I thought.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.752
You know what I dig most
about Pen Gu?

11:27.785 --> 11:29.353
What?

11:29.386 --> 11:33.090
Nothing ever happens here.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.527
Chicken and penguin!

11:36.560 --> 11:38.195
Heh!
Never mind.

11:38.228 --> 11:40.264
Something <i> is</i> happening.

11:40.298 --> 11:41.199
Wait.

11:41.232 --> 11:44.236
I've seen that seagull
somewhere before.

11:44.269 --> 11:46.104
Prepare yourselves.

11:46.136 --> 11:48.439
It's the moment you've
all been waiting for.

11:48.473 --> 11:51.376
The Hang 5!
They're here.

11:51.409 --> 11:53.578
The Hang 5?
The most legendary

11:53.611 --> 11:55.514
surf crew of all time?

11:55.546 --> 11:57.248
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo!

11:58.667 --> 12:00.051
Oh, yeah.

12:00.084 --> 12:02.253
Oh, great. Way to ruin
the surprise, kid.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.256
That was supposed to be <i> my</i> line.

12:04.289 --> 12:07.592
You can still say it.

12:07.625 --> 12:09.528
You know what?
Forget it.

12:09.560 --> 12:12.663
There used to be respect for
showmanship in this business.

12:12.697 --> 12:16.268
Wait a minute. I'm
the resident Hang 5 expert here.

12:17.299 --> 12:19.737
If they were coming,
trust me, I'd know about it.

12:19.771 --> 12:21.223
Hey, Hang 5!

12:31.882 --> 12:33.718
What's up, little dudes?

12:33.751 --> 12:35.420
Uh...

12:37.288 --> 12:39.157
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.492
We get crazed fans all the time.

12:41.525 --> 12:43.594
But it's like I always say:

12:43.627 --> 12:47.131
A brave man builds his house
on an ocean of milk.

12:47.165 --> 12:49.816
That doesn't make
a lick of sense.

12:49.817 --> 12:51.303
It doesn't have to.
I'm the boss,

12:51.335 --> 12:53.604
and I like milk...
and fish.

12:53.637 --> 12:56.507
'Cause I'm an otter,
and otters like fish.

12:56.540 --> 12:59.377
I just wish you
could milk a fish.

13:02.780 --> 13:06.318
I don't really know
what to say about that.

13:06.351 --> 13:08.886
Hey, bro. You know where
we can get something to eat?

13:08.920 --> 13:10.689
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Food, right.

13:10.722 --> 13:13.225
Uh, you guys eat food
'cause you're the Hang 5.

13:13.257 --> 13:14.825
What about squid on a stick?

13:14.858 --> 13:17.595
Squids? On sticks?

13:17.628 --> 13:19.897
I love impaled food.

13:19.930 --> 13:22.400
Ooh, yeah, I'll try anything.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.270
Oh, yeah? Well, I've tried
everything, twice.

13:25.303 --> 13:27.272
Whatever gnarly stuff
you can eat,

13:27.304 --> 13:29.907
I can eat twice as much,
twice as fast.

13:29.940 --> 13:33.844
Jeez, Hunter, why do you always
have to be so competitive?

13:33.877 --> 13:37.581
You know what? You should come
over for a backyard luau.

13:37.615 --> 13:40.919
Come on. I won't take no for an
answer. You should just come.

13:40.952 --> 13:44.155
Yeah, man. Bring it on.
I'm starving.

13:44.189 --> 13:46.625
Tell me more
about these squid sticks.

13:46.657 --> 13:48.225
Hey, look at me, Hang 5.

13:48.258 --> 13:50.494
Whoa! Hold on there. Be careful.

13:50.527 --> 13:52.897
I know all your moves.
Like this.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.632
Ugh!

13:54.665 --> 13:57.535
Help! Lani! Help! Help!

13:57.569 --> 13:58.904
Oh, no. Arnold!

13:58.936 --> 14:00.388
Kid!

14:00.389 --> 14:01.839
Hang on, Arnold.
I'm coming!

14:08.545 --> 14:09.580
Hold on.

14:09.613 --> 14:11.449
Whoa! Who's that?

14:11.482 --> 14:14.618
Oh, that's just Arnold.
This happens all the time.

14:14.651 --> 14:16.453
Lani's on it.

14:16.487 --> 14:18.356
Arnold,

14:18.389 --> 14:20.892
You know what I said
about going into the ocean

14:20.925 --> 14:22.727
- by yourself.
- I know.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.230
Thanks for having
my back out there.

14:25.262 --> 14:26.931
Aw!

14:26.964 --> 14:28.666
Whoa! You all right,
little dude?

14:28.699 --> 14:31.869
Yeah. I was just trying
to show you my mad skills.

14:31.902 --> 14:34.505
You shouldn't try to imitate us.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.408
We're trained professionals.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.776
Some of us with huge muscles.

14:40.511 --> 14:43.448
I'm not gonna say who.
That would be bragging.

14:44.815 --> 14:46.383
Nice moves.

14:46.416 --> 14:49.687
Oh, thanks.
You must be the Hang 5.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.223
Guess that explains the whale.

14:52.756 --> 14:54.341
Oops! I forgot to lock it.

14:55.959 --> 14:57.761
Hey, Lani.
Guess what.

14:57.795 --> 15:00.899
I'm throwing a luau
for the Hang 5 at my place.

15:00.931 --> 15:03.701
Oh, yes.
Let's luau!

15:03.734 --> 15:05.036
All right!

15:05.037 --> 15:06.337
Yeah!

15:11.976 --> 15:13.812
Yes. Come on, Hunter.

15:13.844 --> 15:16.013
Whoo!

15:16.046 --> 15:18.649
Hang 5 is the real deal.

15:18.683 --> 15:19.718
They've done everything.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.721
<i>Snowboard during an
avalanche: Check.</i>

15:22.753 --> 15:25.689
<i>Check.</i>

15:25.723 --> 15:27.858
<i>Check.</i>

15:27.891 --> 15:31.396
Whatever it is they're about
to do, I wanna be a part of it.

15:31.429 --> 15:33.298
Tell us a story,
J.C.

15:33.330 --> 15:34.999
Tell us a scary one.

15:35.032 --> 15:36.667
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah! yeah!

15:36.700 --> 15:40.471
All right. This happened
while I was on tour last year.

15:40.505 --> 15:43.508
We were surfing the infamous
ghost beach of Levesque

15:43.540 --> 15:46.744
where they say
even the waves are haunted.

15:46.777 --> 15:48.612
But were you scared?

15:48.646 --> 15:50.448
Not at first.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.617
But it was quiet.
Too quiet.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.685
Then this ghost wave
grabs my board!

15:54.718 --> 15:55.886
Whoa! Ah, ah...

15:55.887 --> 15:57.054
And then what happened?

15:57.088 --> 15:58.689
So there I am underwater...

15:58.723 --> 16:01.593
He was held down by almost
5000 psi of pressure.

16:01.626 --> 16:04.862
Read about it in your interview
with <i> Rolling Waves Magazine.</i>

16:04.896 --> 16:06.665
Escargot-go?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.433
Uh, no, thanks.

16:08.466 --> 16:09.768
I woke up on the ocean floor...

16:09.800 --> 16:12.503
I've practiced your
breathing technique for years.

16:12.536 --> 16:14.638
I can hold my breath
for almost five minutes.

16:14.671 --> 16:16.473
I'm trying to tell
my story, bro.

16:16.506 --> 16:19.343
Can I show you my variation
on your five flipper shuffle?

16:19.376 --> 16:21.912
Go check on the Undertaker.
He's always hungry.

16:21.945 --> 16:23.580
Yes, sir.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.884
All right. So there I was,
200 feet underwater

16:26.918 --> 16:28.653
and I'm freaking out.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.888
Did you do a controlled
emergency ascent

16:30.921 --> 16:32.824
to protect your lungs?

16:32.857 --> 16:34.391
Uh, yeah.

16:34.425 --> 16:35.693
How'd you know about that?

16:35.694 --> 16:36.960
Cody taught us that

16:36.993 --> 16:38.512
at our surf school.

16:40.064 --> 16:41.800
That guy?

16:42.833 --> 16:45.402
Um... Interesting.

16:45.435 --> 16:48.006
If you kids think J.C.'s
dumb old stories are cool,

16:48.039 --> 16:49.291
watch me uproot this tree.

16:50.574 --> 16:51.726
Ugh!

16:54.645 --> 16:57.582
Anyways, wanna hear about
the time I fought off a shark

16:57.615 --> 16:59.084
with nothing but my camo shorts?

16:59.085 --> 17:00.552
Yeah!

17:00.584 --> 17:04.356
Mr. Undertaker, do you
wanna try some of the...?

17:06.991 --> 17:08.193
More.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.394
Coming right up.

17:09.425 --> 17:11.396
Hey, have you seen
my friend, Cod...

17:11.428 --> 17:14.698
Whoa, man, don't eat me.
I'm not the food.

17:14.732 --> 17:17.001
Can you at least
lay an egg or something?

17:20.405 --> 17:23.708
Scary? Yeah,
I get that sometimes.

17:23.741 --> 17:26.743
They say it's because
I don't smile or talk a lot.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.346
But I'm just shy. Okay?

17:29.946 --> 17:31.782
Oh...

17:33.617 --> 17:35.720
Little of this,
little of that...

17:35.752 --> 17:37.989
All right, add some spice...

17:38.021 --> 17:40.657
Oh, yeah.
Prepping that squid.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.097
Would you like
some coconut water?

17:46.129 --> 17:47.998
That depends.

17:48.031 --> 17:49.249
I prefer fish milk.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.467
Uh...

17:50.501 --> 17:52.936
All right, then I'll drink
your coconut water.

17:52.970 --> 17:55.640
But you better believe
I'm gonna pretend

17:55.673 --> 17:57.709
I'm sucking it from
a fish's udder.

17:57.742 --> 17:59.743
Heh, heh! You know,
Mr. McMahon,

17:59.777 --> 18:01.746
I do a little surfing myself.

18:01.779 --> 18:02.797
Ah! Cool, cool.

18:02.798 --> 18:03.815
Mm-hm. It is cool.

18:03.848 --> 18:05.683
And you know what?
I got some ideas

18:05.715 --> 18:08.185
for some tricks that could
really change things up.

18:08.219 --> 18:10.188
I'm talking next-level
stuff, man.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.424
Oh, yeah? You'll have
to show me sometime.

18:12.456 --> 18:14.591
Really? Let's set a time.
How about tomorrow?

18:14.625 --> 18:15.859
Excuse me a second.

18:15.893 --> 18:18.430
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

18:22.066 --> 18:24.602
What I hold here
is the key that will unlock

18:24.635 --> 18:26.971
one of the greatest
mysteries of our time.

18:28.539 --> 18:31.542
Why everything seems
to taste like me?

18:31.576 --> 18:33.611
No.
This is a map

18:33.644 --> 18:36.882
to the most legendary
surfing spot on the planet.

18:38.182 --> 18:40.785
The Trenches!

18:41.786 --> 18:44.456
I thought that the Trenches
were just, like,

18:44.489 --> 18:46.191
made up... to scare
little kids.

18:46.223 --> 18:48.626
Oh, it's real, all right.

18:48.658 --> 18:51.528
And everything you hear
about it is true.

18:51.561 --> 18:54.531
It's hidden somewhere on
Slaughter Island,

18:54.565 --> 18:56.201
the most dangerous

18:56.233 --> 18:58.502
and mysterious place
on the planet.

18:58.536 --> 19:01.072
Jagged rocks, huge cliffs.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.508
It's a surfer's graveyard.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.510
And we're going to ride it!

19:05.542 --> 19:07.478
RTL!
Am I right, guys?

19:07.511 --> 19:09.213
Heck, yeah! RTL!

19:09.246 --> 19:11.081
RTL!

19:11.115 --> 19:14.819
Hey, Joe, what does RTL mean?

19:16.287 --> 19:18.857
I don't know, man.
Rumbly tummy...

19:20.691 --> 19:22.227
ooh, something.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.862
Ugh...

19:23.895 --> 19:27.264
Oh, I shouldn't have eaten
all those escargot-gos.

19:27.298 --> 19:30.934
Surfing the Trenches will be
the greatest ride of my life.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.036
And my last.

19:33.069 --> 19:34.838
Because you're gonna die?

19:34.871 --> 19:36.273
No!

19:36.307 --> 19:38.276
Because I'm retiring.

19:38.309 --> 19:40.645
What?

19:40.677 --> 19:42.679
Boss, you can't be serious.

19:42.713 --> 19:44.682
Hey, I'm not getting
any younger.

19:44.714 --> 19:46.717
It's time for me to settle down.

19:46.751 --> 19:50.054
What does that mean? We're
gonna be the Hang 4 from now on?

19:50.087 --> 19:51.556
Maybe not.

19:51.588 --> 19:54.224
Big Z always said Pen Gu
breeds great surfers.

19:54.258 --> 19:56.194
I think it's time
we add a new member.

19:56.226 --> 19:58.829
Have somebody in mind, boss?

19:59.864 --> 20:02.733
I'm not gonna give away
the surprise just yet.

20:02.767 --> 20:06.638
But I think I might have
found someone very special.

20:08.004 --> 20:09.840
Yes!

20:11.943 --> 20:14.177
How totally awesome
is this, bro?

20:14.211 --> 20:16.014
I'm gonna join the Hang 5.

20:16.047 --> 20:18.750
Can you even imagine
what that would be like?

20:18.782 --> 20:21.552
Yeah, that sounds pretty rad,

20:21.586 --> 20:24.222
but, um, are you sure
Mr. McMahon

20:24.254 --> 20:26.323
was talking about you, bro?

20:26.357 --> 20:28.292
What? Who else
could it be, man?

20:28.326 --> 20:30.161
He looked right at me.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.696
Hey, Cody. You up?

20:32.730 --> 20:34.165
Yeah. Hey,
what's up, Lani?

20:34.197 --> 20:36.967
Hey. So you got
a second?

20:37.001 --> 20:38.770
I need to tell you something.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.938
Sure. I was talking about
how great it'd be

20:40.972 --> 20:43.107
if the Hang 5
asked me to join them.

20:43.139 --> 20:45.576
Oh, um, okay.

20:45.609 --> 20:47.878
You think they might ask you?

20:47.912 --> 20:49.814
Well, yeah.
I mean, why not?

20:49.847 --> 20:51.782
I've been following them
my whole life.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.751
And I'm the best surfer
on Pen Gu.

20:53.783 --> 20:55.686
Who else are they gonna ask?

20:55.720 --> 20:58.655
Hey, Lani, I told my mom
that you told me

20:58.688 --> 21:00.791
that you were
going to join the Hang 5.

21:00.825 --> 21:03.962
And then she said that
I should get your autograph

21:03.994 --> 21:07.030
because she
wants to sell it online.

21:07.063 --> 21:08.031
What?

21:08.065 --> 21:11.235
Whoa!
That's awesome, Lani.

21:11.268 --> 21:13.838
Cody, your imaginary friends

21:13.870 --> 21:16.740
are gonna be so disappointed.

21:18.142 --> 21:20.678
So... I guess they asked you.

21:20.711 --> 21:22.680
Yeah. Mr. McMahon
and Paige

21:22.713 --> 21:24.915
came over to my place
this morning.

21:24.948 --> 21:27.217
They said I showed moxie
saving Arnold

21:27.251 --> 21:30.154
and they could use somebody
with my lifeguard skills.

21:30.186 --> 21:33.190
They're waiting for me
on the South Shore.

21:33.223 --> 21:36.093
But I don't know, Cody.
This is your dream.

21:36.126 --> 21:39.396
No. No, no... No way.
You can't pass this up, Lani.

21:39.430 --> 21:42.066
It's the Hang 5,
all right? You gotta go.

21:42.098 --> 21:44.101
I'll figure something out.
Don't worry.

21:44.135 --> 21:45.903
Wait, really?
Will you be okay?

21:45.935 --> 21:47.804
- I don't want to...
- For sure.

21:47.838 --> 21:50.116
Go tell them you're coming
before they change their minds.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.925
I'll see you there.

21:51.926 --> 21:53.710
Okay, okay. Bye!

21:53.743 --> 21:56.146
Does that mean
you're not leaving Pen Gu

21:56.180 --> 21:57.849
and joining the Hang 5

21:57.882 --> 22:00.018
and fulfilling your
ultimate destiny

22:00.050 --> 22:02.219
of becoming a legendary surfer?

22:02.220 --> 22:04.388
No, I got an idea.

22:04.422 --> 22:08.026
Come on, you guys.
I'll explain on the way.

22:08.059 --> 22:09.827
Hang 5!

22:09.859 --> 22:12.129
Prepare for boarding.

22:12.163 --> 22:14.665
Don't be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

22:14.698 --> 22:16.667
I have a good feeling about you.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.001
Ha, ha. Thanks.

22:18.034 --> 22:19.453
Is that them?

22:19.454 --> 22:20.871
Yeah, yeah, come on.

22:20.905 --> 22:22.807
Get over there.

22:22.839 --> 22:25.742
Do what Cody taught us.

22:25.776 --> 22:27.745
Um... Ah...

22:27.778 --> 22:30.415
Look. Who's that
in the water?

22:30.447 --> 22:33.417
It must be Cody Maverick,

22:33.451 --> 22:37.055
Pen Gu's favorite surfer.

22:38.055 --> 22:40.725
Did you say Cody Maverick?

22:40.758 --> 22:42.727
Let's go watch him.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.328
Yay!

22:44.329 --> 22:45.896
Yeah! Let's go
see Cody!

22:45.930 --> 22:49.434
So have you
done a lot of acting before?

22:49.466 --> 22:52.369
Um... yes. I'm more of
a Method actor.

22:52.403 --> 22:56.339
And I think Arnold comes
from a Broadway background.

Nice moves, kid.

23:33.109 --> 23:35.746
Yo, Mr. McMahon, what
about we bring Cody too?

23:35.780 --> 23:37.381
Let's see what else he's got.

23:37.414 --> 23:41.018
What? We already said we
were bringing my girl Lani.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.136
I wanna bring the chicken.

23:43.253 --> 23:45.289

23:45.321 --> 23:47.891
That's cool.
I gotta warn you, though...

23:47.925 --> 23:49.793
I'm not a great cook.

23:49.827 --> 23:50.912
All right, all right.

23:50.913 --> 23:51.996
Not so fast.

23:52.029 --> 23:54.030
Tank is the one you want.

23:54.063 --> 23:56.833
I heard you're looking for
a champion to join your team.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.502
So I brought my résumé.

23:58.536 --> 24:01.105
Hm...
I like your style.

24:01.137 --> 24:03.507
Reminds me of myself
at a younger age.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.976
Well, thanks. But,
you know,

24:06.010 --> 24:08.512
I'm not as handsome
as you are, sir.

24:08.546 --> 24:10.481
Of course not.

24:10.513 --> 24:11.665
Oops!

24:11.666 --> 24:12.817
Oh, Briana!

24:12.849 --> 24:13.850
Sorry about that.

24:13.851 --> 24:14.851
Oh, that's... good.

24:14.885 --> 24:16.253
- What?
- Uh...

24:16.287 --> 24:17.222
You better take that.

24:17.254 --> 24:19.991
Who made this thing?
My trophies never broke.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.441
Oh, again.

24:21.442 --> 24:22.859
Ridiculous. That
thing's garbage.

24:22.893 --> 24:25.129
- Funny.
- Take it. Take the whole thing back.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.365
Well, now I have more of her.

24:27.397 --> 24:28.799
So... thanks.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.201
This is my guy.

24:30.233 --> 24:33.370
Everybody else has a guy.
I want a guy.

24:33.404 --> 24:35.006
Oh, for crying out loud!

24:35.039 --> 24:37.107
Fine. You can keep
your rookies.

24:37.140 --> 24:38.208
Yes!

24:38.209 --> 24:39.276
Yes! Up top!
Headbutt!

24:39.309 --> 24:40.944
- Ooh!
- Awesome.

24:40.978 --> 24:42.880
Yeah, I love those.

24:42.913 --> 24:44.882
But they're your responsibility.

24:44.915 --> 24:47.417
You've gotta show them
how we do things.

24:47.451 --> 24:51.122
We're gonna challenge you
on all aspects of what we do.

24:51.155 --> 24:54.024
Power, speed,
endurance and teamwork.

24:54.058 --> 24:56.861
May the best
mentor-rookie team win.

24:56.894 --> 24:59.564
Hah! Bring it on, fool.

24:59.597 --> 25:02.433
Well, obviously
Lani and I will win.

25:02.465 --> 25:03.834
Let's do this.

25:03.867 --> 25:06.203
Do you know how to surf?

25:06.236 --> 25:08.271
Dude, I'm a star.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.041
Okay, we're in.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.309
All right. Then that's the way
it's gonna be.

25:13.911 --> 25:16.013
But if your guy or girl
dies or gets hurt

25:16.046 --> 25:18.316
and I have to carry them
all the way back here...

25:18.348 --> 25:20.851
I'm gonna make you scrub
the whale for a year!

25:20.885 --> 25:24.454
All aboard! Next stop,
Slaughter Island.

25:24.488 --> 25:28.025
So how much did you pay
to bribe those kids?

25:28.058 --> 25:29.510
Three shells apiece.

25:29.511 --> 25:30.962
You're such a dork.

25:30.994 --> 25:32.896
Not to mention a failure.

25:34.098 --> 25:35.532
When I become one of the Hang 5,

25:35.566 --> 25:38.236
I'm gonna come back here and
crush your surf school.

25:38.269 --> 25:40.238
All your students will be mine.

25:40.271 --> 25:41.406
And they'll be happy.

25:42.572 --> 25:43.907
Like me.

25:43.941 --> 25:46.277
We can't let him win, Cody.

25:46.309 --> 25:47.944
Don't worry.

25:47.978 --> 25:49.547
I got this.

25:53.017 --> 25:56.154
Can't this thing go
a little slower?

25:57.354 --> 25:59.390
Ha! Where would be
the fun in that?

25:59.423 --> 26:01.626
We're passing through some
rough waters.

26:01.658 --> 26:03.493
It's safer to go fast.

26:03.527 --> 26:04.729
Aah, aah, aah...

26:04.730 --> 26:05.930
Joe!

26:07.299 --> 26:08.633
Thanks, man.

26:08.665 --> 26:11.601
Almost lost my lunch.

26:11.635 --> 26:13.971

26:14.003 --> 26:17.507

Forward, ever forward,

27:54.738 --> 27:57.107
our intrepid team presses on,

27:57.140 --> 27:59.376
woefully unaware that no penguin

27:59.409 --> 28:01.711

the Trenches

28:01.744 --> 28:04.048
and lived to tell the story.

28:07.350 --> 28:10.087
Looks like this is
as far as the whale goes.

28:10.119 --> 28:12.756
I got your board for you,
Mr. Hunter, right here.

28:12.790 --> 28:13.941
Thanks, Hank.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.091

- RTL!

28:18.761 --> 28:20.364
RTL!

28:20.396 --> 28:22.366

what RTL means?

28:22.398 --> 28:24.501
It means
"race the losers."

28:31.675 --> 28:33.376
Hey, excuse me.

28:33.409 --> 28:36.179
Can you take me back to Pen Gu?

28:36.213 --> 28:38.648

- Ugh!

28:40.617 --> 28:42.319

29:15.853 --> 29:18.722
Whoa!

Killer view, bro.

29:22.392 --> 29:25.729
Hey, rookies!
We're down here!

29:25.761 --> 29:29.232
Ooh, yeah! Whoa! Yes!

29:31.268 --> 29:32.870
Wow! Oh, my gosh,

29:32.903 --> 29:34.872
you can surf on this stuff.

29:34.905 --> 29:37.075
Dude, what is this?

29:39.742 --> 29:42.679
The taste of death.

29:42.713 --> 29:46.617
This is crushed whale bones.

29:46.649 --> 29:48.351
I should move here.

29:48.385 --> 29:51.222
All right, the conch is telling
me we have to keep moving.

29:51.254 --> 29:54.124
This place is dangerous,
so let's head out.

29:54.157 --> 29:56.459
What's so dangerous about it?

29:56.492 --> 29:59.329
Hold on.
What's that, conch?

29:59.363 --> 30:01.165
Okay, I'll tell him.

30:01.197 --> 30:03.733
Conch says, shut up!

30:03.767 --> 30:05.169
- Heh, heh.
- Hey.

30:05.202 --> 30:06.403
From up here,

30:06.435 --> 30:08.172
it looks like the sand pit
will take us

30:08.204 --> 30:09.339
straight into the island.

30:09.373 --> 30:11.509
That'll save us a ton of time.

30:11.541 --> 30:12.609
How about a race?

30:18.514 --> 30:20.751
Yeah, Tank.
You're going down.

30:20.783 --> 30:24.888
Ooh, I'm so scared. Not.

30:24.922 --> 30:27.391

30:27.424 --> 30:30.426
And as always,
it'll be ladies first!

30:30.460 --> 30:33.530
Me and the chicken are in too.
Where is he?

30:33.563 --> 30:36.800
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way,

30:36.832 --> 30:39.302
but didn't you used to be
taller?

30:39.336 --> 30:40.503
- Aah!
- Oh, my gosh,

30:40.537 --> 30:42.273
- You're standing in quicksand!
- Ugh!

30:42.306 --> 30:45.543
Cody, Lani, J.C., help!

30:47.277 --> 30:48.277
Lani, pull!

30:49.680 --> 30:52.616
I'm trying.
He's like a boulder.

30:52.648 --> 30:53.649
I got this.

30:53.684 --> 30:56.252
Come on, big guy.
Let's get you out of there.

30:58.222 --> 30:59.690
How much do you weigh?

30:59.723 --> 31:01.724
Hunter,
help me look for the chicken.

31:01.758 --> 31:02.793
Already on it.

31:02.826 --> 31:04.295
I found him.

31:04.328 --> 31:06.664
There, by that rock.
To your right.

31:06.696 --> 31:08.198
Hunh! Gotcha.

31:09.933 --> 31:14.238
Am I dead?
Are you my father?

31:16.473 --> 31:17.642
Come on!

31:27.984 --> 31:30.687
Come on! Come on!

31:30.721 --> 31:32.690
Aah!

31:32.723 --> 31:34.625
Yeah! Go, J.C.

31:34.657 --> 31:37.994
Ha, ha!
That's how it's done.

31:38.028 --> 31:40.463
Wow, J.C. Perfect form.

31:40.496 --> 31:41.915
Thanks, kid.

31:41.916 --> 31:43.333
Very impressive.

31:43.367 --> 31:45.435
You gonna put me down now?

31:45.469 --> 31:47.271
You're lucky it's leg day.

31:47.303 --> 31:48.871
I'm just gonna sneak in
a quick set.

31:52.675 --> 31:54.677
Thanks, show-off.

31:54.711 --> 31:56.413
Any time.

31:56.445 --> 31:59.349
Leg-pressing a large,
heavy boulder.

31:59.383 --> 32:01.318
Then onto a one-handed
handstand,

32:01.350 --> 32:04.021
all while
still leg-pressing the boulder.

32:04.053 --> 32:06.357
The secret
to my amazing physique?

32:06.389 --> 32:09.626
Eat right, exercise
and never give up

32:09.659 --> 32:12.429
on being awesome.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.266
Hang 5, let's do this!

32:19.403 --> 32:20.404
All right!

32:20.436 --> 32:22.505
Yeah! Yeah, dude!

32:24.573 --> 32:28.378
Let's see how these wave jockeys
perform on the dunes.

32:28.412 --> 32:30.748
They have not put in the hours
shredding the sand,

32:30.780 --> 32:33.817
but, wow, folks,
they're putting on quite a show.

32:33.849 --> 32:35.886
I make this look good.

32:35.918 --> 32:37.754
Yeah!

32:37.788 --> 32:38.789
Bring it!

32:38.821 --> 32:41.357
Check this out.

32:41.390 --> 32:42.458
Nice moves, Paige.

32:42.492 --> 32:43.926
All right.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.328

32:45.361 --> 32:47.831
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:50.834 --> 32:52.770
Lani, I see a shortcut.

32:52.802 --> 32:54.304
Right behind you.

32:54.338 --> 32:56.940
Ho, ho!
In your face, Hunter.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.478
Whee!

33:01.511 --> 33:03.097
Whoa.

33:03.098 --> 33:04.682
Rest in peace.

33:05.615 --> 33:07.617
Yeah. Ugh!

33:10.986 --> 33:12.055
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha.

33:12.088 --> 33:14.625
Ho, ho!

33:14.657 --> 33:15.892
Yeah!

33:17.094 --> 33:18.095
Bye, J.C.

33:18.127 --> 33:20.697
Ha-ha-ha. Aw...

33:20.731 --> 33:22.400
This is it.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.069
Eat my dust, Tank.

33:25.101 --> 33:26.636
Oh, that's what you think.

33:27.703 --> 33:28.739
Whoa!

33:28.771 --> 33:30.640
Ha-ha-ha!

33:33.909 --> 33:36.713
Sand's the best!

33:37.681 --> 33:39.415
Cody!

33:42.786 --> 33:44.872
You still with me, bro?

33:44.873 --> 33:46.957
Ugh. Yeah. I think so.

33:46.990 --> 33:48.959
- Ha-ha-ha, awesome.
- Whoo!

33:48.992 --> 33:50.426
Paige, we finished first.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.761
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah!

33:51.794 --> 33:53.396
That was incredible.

33:53.430 --> 33:55.733
Ho, ho, ho, unh!

33:59.136 --> 34:00.870
Mmm...

34:05.040 --> 34:07.444
That tickled.

34:08.145 --> 34:09.780
Great job out there, Lani.

34:09.812 --> 34:10.914
Ha-ha-ha!

34:10.946 --> 34:12.982
Thanks.
That was a lot of fun.

34:13.014 --> 34:14.550
Gotta hand it to you, Paige.

34:14.583 --> 34:17.053
You got me good when
you banked off that rib cage

34:17.085 --> 34:18.621
and landed in front of me.

34:18.655 --> 34:20.723
I've got a few tricks
you haven't seen.

34:20.755 --> 34:22.626
Hey. Check it out.

34:25.060 --> 34:29.699
Hey, flattop. What happened?
You take the scenic route?

34:29.732 --> 34:32.768
Heh, heh. Yeah, you know me.
I'm just a bit of a tourist.

34:32.803 --> 34:34.571
I like to take in the sights.

34:34.603 --> 34:37.741
Remember, I like a
nice high gloss on my board.

34:37.774 --> 34:40.543
Don't get too comfortable.
I'll get you back.

34:40.577 --> 34:42.812
That was quite a spill
you took out there.

34:42.844 --> 34:44.397
How does my dust taste?

34:44.398 --> 34:45.947
You cut me off, you cheater.

34:45.981 --> 34:49.085
Oh? I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:49.118 --> 34:50.420
I'd never do anything

34:50.453 --> 34:51.420
- to hurt you.
- Hey!

34:51.455 --> 34:52.422
You should learn

34:52.455 --> 34:53.456
to stay out of my way.

34:53.489 --> 34:54.891
I'm gonna join the Hang 5,

34:54.925 --> 34:55.926
no matter what.

34:55.958 --> 34:57.493
How badly you want to lose

34:57.526 --> 34:59.629
is entirely up to you.

35:03.033 --> 35:04.101
Grrr...

35:05.935 --> 35:09.740
That Tank guy is ridiculous.
He's like a cartoon villain.

35:09.772 --> 35:12.209
Why did you let Hunter
bring him?

35:12.242 --> 35:14.912
Everyone is here for a reason.

35:14.944 --> 35:18.649
I want to see how the rest
of the newbies deal with him.

35:18.682 --> 35:20.950
You still think
Cody has what it takes?

35:20.984 --> 35:23.787
Look, Mr. McMahon,
I know he wiped out out there,

35:23.819 --> 35:25.923
but he's a good surfer.
Give him a chance.

35:25.955 --> 35:28.559
I'm not talking about surfing.
I've been watching him.

35:28.591 --> 35:32.195
I think he's a bit of a hothead.
He might want this <i> too</i> much.

35:32.229 --> 35:35.198
Don't worry about it.
He's just like me at that age.

35:35.231 --> 35:36.466
He'll be cool.

35:36.499 --> 35:39.235
All right, we'll see.

35:41.104 --> 35:42.872
Okay, okay. I've got one.

35:42.906 --> 35:47.010
What did the wave say
to the surfer?

35:47.042 --> 35:48.245
Oh, what?

35:48.278 --> 35:50.848
Have a swell time!

35:53.082 --> 35:54.184
Get it, huh?

35:54.216 --> 35:55.785
Have a swell time.

35:55.818 --> 35:59.589
Oh, ha, ha, swell.
Ha-ha-ha.

35:59.622 --> 36:01.825
Oh, that was good.
Swell.

36:01.857 --> 36:03.160
Oh, Mr. McMahon,

36:03.193 --> 36:06.530
that's, like, the greatest
surfing joke maybe ever.

36:06.562 --> 36:08.265
So good. Unh!

36:08.298 --> 36:10.566
Thank you.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.969
What do you call a surfer

36:12.002 --> 36:14.204
that just broke up
with his girlfriend?

36:14.236 --> 36:16.539
Homeless!

36:22.178 --> 36:25.582
Dude, Cody. We're just trying
to wax the boards,

36:25.615 --> 36:26.917
not set them on fire.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.986
You're gonna burn a hole
in that thing.

36:29.019 --> 36:29.986
Ugh.

36:30.019 --> 36:30.987
Tank cheated.

36:31.021 --> 36:32.189
He knocked me off my board.

36:32.222 --> 36:33.290
That's why we lost.

36:33.323 --> 36:35.993
Yeah? I didn't see anything.

36:36.026 --> 36:37.528
You sure?

36:37.560 --> 36:38.961
He totally rubbed it in my face.

36:38.995 --> 36:40.731
He practically admitted to it.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.865
That's messed up.
But you know what?

36:42.899 --> 36:44.201
Maybe let it go.

36:44.234 --> 36:46.537
It's not worth getting all
bent out of shape about.

36:46.569 --> 36:51.274
We had an awesome day, right?
Were those dunes gnarly or what?

36:51.307 --> 36:53.709
Yeah.
That was pretty epic.

36:53.743 --> 36:56.680
And I got to ride with you guys.
It still feels pretty surreal.

36:56.713 --> 36:57.881
I mean, like, I can't believe

36:57.914 --> 36:59.883
this is actually my life
right now.

36:59.915 --> 37:04.620
I just... I just wish
that I hadn't let you down.

37:04.653 --> 37:07.223
Let me down?
What are you talking about?

37:07.256 --> 37:10.626
Look, man. There are plenty
of jerks out there.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.030
If it's not Tank,
it'll be somebody else.

37:13.062 --> 37:14.597
Just take the high road.

37:14.631 --> 37:18.035
You'll be a lot happier,
I promise.

37:19.202 --> 37:21.705
All right, man.
You got it.

37:22.772 --> 37:24.040
- Ha, ha!
- Pull.

37:24.073 --> 37:25.175
- Pull.
- Whoo!

37:25.209 --> 37:27.395
Pull. Pull.

37:27.396 --> 37:29.580
Whoa. Heh. All right!

37:29.613 --> 37:31.398
Why are they sleeping up there?

37:31.399 --> 37:33.183
Mmm...

37:33.216 --> 37:34.984
Maybe they don't like us.

37:35.017 --> 37:37.053
I bet it's a tribal thing,
you know?

37:37.086 --> 37:39.088
Paying homage
to the surfing gods.

37:39.122 --> 37:40.991
Wrong. None of the above.

37:41.024 --> 37:43.126
It's actually for protection.

37:43.158 --> 37:45.328
Protection? From what?

37:45.361 --> 37:46.930
This is Slaughter Island.

37:46.963 --> 37:50.367
Who knows what's creeping around
at night?

37:52.267 --> 37:55.137
And you're gonna want to plant
that board a bit deeper, bro.

37:55.171 --> 37:56.138
Oh!

37:56.171 --> 37:57.340
Ha-ha-ha.

37:57.374 --> 37:59.076
You guys sleep up
in the nosebleeds

37:59.109 --> 38:00.077
if you want to.

38:00.109 --> 38:01.678
Tank Evans is not scared

38:01.711 --> 38:03.280
of some little forest critters.

38:03.312 --> 38:05.348
Neither is my main girl,
Michelle.

38:05.381 --> 38:06.849
Isn't that right, baby?

38:06.883 --> 38:10.153
Big Daddy won't let anything
harm you.

38:12.055 --> 38:14.223
This is Michelle.

38:14.256 --> 38:17.126
We've been together for about...
What is it, babe?

38:17.160 --> 38:18.261
Three years now.

38:18.294 --> 38:19.963
I bought her at a garage sale.

38:19.995 --> 38:24.834
I saw her from across the lawn.
I was like, "Oh, yeah."

38:24.868 --> 38:27.136
Don't get me wrong,
I still ride other boards.

38:27.169 --> 38:32.041
But...
But Michelle, she's special.

38:32.075 --> 38:35.044
Hey, Tank.
Does Michelle have a friend?

38:35.077 --> 38:37.980
Yeah? Well,
we're not scared either.

38:38.013 --> 38:39.950
Yeah. If you're fine
with it, I am.

38:39.982 --> 38:41.818
I ain't afraid
of no forest critters.

38:41.850 --> 38:43.653
- Totally cool.
- Okay. Yep.

38:43.687 --> 38:45.889
So we're all fine down here.
Oof!

38:45.921 --> 38:49.258
Mmm.
Well, you all sleep tight then.

38:49.292 --> 38:51.995
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

38:52.028 --> 38:53.363
Oh, we won't.

38:53.396 --> 38:56.867
And the bed bugs will bite you.
Ugh!

38:58.301 --> 38:59.937
Uh...

39:17.019 --> 39:18.187
Hm?

39:26.428 --> 39:27.963
Don't hate me, man.

39:27.997 --> 39:30.968
I'm just polishing my trophy.

39:39.374 --> 39:42.078
I think I just laid an egg.

39:42.111 --> 39:44.180
I didn't forget about you, babe.

39:47.249 --> 39:49.085
Oh! Ow...

39:55.124 --> 39:56.225
Whoa!

39:56.258 --> 39:57.760
Nice hang time.

39:59.495 --> 40:00.763
Cody?

40:27.289 --> 40:31.060
Congratulations. You're dead.
Ha, ha!

40:31.093 --> 40:32.229
What?

40:33.328 --> 40:34.363
That's what happens

40:34.397 --> 40:35.507
when you don't work together

40:35.531 --> 40:37.934
in a place like this.

40:37.966 --> 40:40.102
Wait, wait, wait.
This was a test?

40:40.135 --> 40:41.103
It was.

40:41.136 --> 40:41.905
We wanted to see

40:41.937 --> 40:44.039
how well you work
under pressure.

40:44.073 --> 40:46.810
Never split up.
Understand?

40:46.843 --> 40:48.879
You stick together,
no matter what.

40:48.912 --> 40:52.115
When you're a team, you always
have each other's backs.

40:52.147 --> 40:53.883
Got it?

40:55.450 --> 40:58.521
Well, all things considered,
not bad for your first time.

40:58.555 --> 41:01.024
At least none of you
peed your pants.

41:01.057 --> 41:02.825
Right, Hunter? Ha-ha-ha!

41:04.026 --> 41:07.296
I told you guys,
I sat in a puddle.

41:07.330 --> 41:08.965
- Oh, yeah.
- All right!

41:08.997 --> 41:12.269
Don't worry, Hunter, bro.
I peed my pants too.

41:12.301 --> 41:14.245
- I don't have any pants,
- J.C.: Let's go!

41:14.269 --> 41:16.105
So I mostly just peed
on my feet.

41:16.138 --> 41:19.142
I bet you thought it was me
making all that noise.

41:19.175 --> 41:21.211
Didn't you?

41:23.912 --> 41:25.948
Yeah.
You don't wanna mess with me

41:25.981 --> 41:28.284
when I'm in a bad mood.

41:53.209 --> 41:54.845
Can't sleep?

41:54.877 --> 41:57.446
Yeah, I think I need a minute
to calm down

41:57.479 --> 41:58.815
from all the excitement.

41:59.948 --> 42:01.550
My heart's jumping
out of my chest.

42:01.584 --> 42:03.587
Yeah, I can imagine.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.989
This has been some day.

42:06.022 --> 42:08.158
Must be a pretty big deal
to you.

42:08.191 --> 42:11.595
This is my dream, Lani.
I can't stop thinking about it.

42:11.627 --> 42:13.863
I don't think
I blinked once all day.

42:13.897 --> 42:16.033
I didn't wanna miss a second.

42:21.104 --> 42:23.073
Mr. McMahon
thinks you're amazing.

42:23.106 --> 42:24.908
He's totally gonna pick you.

42:24.941 --> 42:27.310
Mm. I don't know.

42:27.343 --> 42:31.882
I miss Pen Gu.
We've been gone for so long.

42:31.914 --> 42:33.491
I can't wait
to tell our friends back home

42:33.515 --> 42:35.050
about all of this.

42:35.084 --> 42:37.287
Heh, heh. Yeah.
They'll never believe it.

42:37.319 --> 42:39.122
I wish every day was like this.

42:39.155 --> 42:40.665
I feel like I'm finally
living the life

42:40.689 --> 42:42.892
I've always wanted to, you know?

42:42.926 --> 42:45.228
I wish this feeling
could last forever.

42:45.260 --> 42:46.061
Heh.

42:46.095 --> 42:48.932
Yeah, well,
you still gotta sleep.

42:48.964 --> 42:50.633
Yeah, in a minute.

42:50.667 --> 42:53.337
Let's soak this in
a while longer.

43:14.423 --> 43:16.225
Uh...

43:18.260 --> 43:19.361
Uh!

43:25.667 --> 43:28.271
Cock-a-doodle-dude!

43:30.539 --> 43:33.476
Cock-a-doodle-shut up!

43:45.588 --> 43:47.925
I slept like a corpse.

43:52.194 --> 43:54.564
Come on, guys. We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

43:54.597 --> 43:56.598
Remember what we talked about
last night.

43:56.631 --> 43:58.100
After all, this journey

43:58.133 --> 44:00.302
isn't just about getting
to the Trenches.

44:00.336 --> 44:03.606
One of you will be replacing me
on the Hang 5.

44:03.638 --> 44:05.709
Those are some big shoes
to fill,

44:05.742 --> 44:09.011
so show me you've got big feet.

44:11.714 --> 44:14.250
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.
Uh, uh-huh.

44:14.283 --> 44:16.586
It says there's supposed to be
a bridge.

44:16.618 --> 44:18.088
- Boss! Stop!
- Mr. McMahon!

44:18.120 --> 44:19.356
- Wait, wait.
- Come back!

44:19.388 --> 44:21.191
- Rerouting.
- Look where you're going!

44:21.223 --> 44:22.992
- What's that mean?
- Don't go further!

44:23.026 --> 44:25.127
Hey, what's the holdup?

44:25.528 --> 44:27.097
Hm...

44:28.430 --> 44:30.967
Ha, ha!
You're afraid of heights?

44:31.700 --> 44:33.068
Oh, yeah!

44:34.703 --> 44:36.439
Whoa.

44:36.472 --> 44:37.540
Whoa.

44:37.573 --> 44:39.609
Ooh.

44:41.810 --> 44:43.078
Let's have some fun.

44:43.111 --> 44:44.713
I bet you can't get past me.

44:47.749 --> 44:50.319
Oh, you're on.

44:50.352 --> 44:52.222
Whoa, whoa!

44:53.789 --> 44:55.357
Perfectly matched.

44:55.390 --> 44:58.394
This is truly
a clash of the titans.

45:02.231 --> 45:04.367
Yeah! Show them
how you do it, Mr. Hunter.

45:04.399 --> 45:06.769
You see that?
He blew right past your guy.

45:06.803 --> 45:08.205
Come on, J.C.

45:08.671 --> 45:10.073
Oh, yeah?

45:12.075 --> 45:13.743
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Ha, ha.

45:13.776 --> 45:15.745
Yeah,
he showed Hunter what's up.

45:15.778 --> 45:16.963
Come on, Lani.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.147
Whoa. Yeah!

45:18.180 --> 45:20.383
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45:20.415 --> 45:21.417
Yeah! Whoo!

45:21.450 --> 45:24.053
Ha-ha-ha.
Nice, Lani. Way to go.

45:24.086 --> 45:26.522
Oh, that's cool, but...

45:30.426 --> 45:32.562
Come on, wimp.
It's our turn.

45:32.595 --> 45:35.265
Hope you don't fall
to your death or anything.

45:37.732 --> 45:39.568
Whoa, whoa!

45:42.772 --> 45:44.274
Can you do this?

45:44.307 --> 45:46.209
- Cut it out!
- Is this bothering you?

45:46.242 --> 45:47.609
Is this bothering you? This?

45:47.642 --> 45:49.812
Cody Maverick looks
like he's in real trouble.

45:49.845 --> 45:51.414
I can't look.

45:51.446 --> 45:54.617
Ha, ha! Try not to look
so scared in front of J.C.

45:55.885 --> 45:57.687
Tank, seriously, stop.
Whoa, whoa.

45:57.720 --> 45:58.754
Okay, okay.

45:58.787 --> 45:59.822
Dude, come on.

45:59.823 --> 46:00.856
This is fun.

46:00.890 --> 46:02.125
Uhn!

46:02.158 --> 46:03.359
Ha-ha-ha. Ow!

46:06.428 --> 46:07.629
Ooh.

46:11.466 --> 46:12.836
No, I'm good.
That was my plan.

46:12.868 --> 46:14.236
Yeah!

46:14.269 --> 46:16.338
That was gnarly. Ha-ha-ha.

46:16.372 --> 46:17.173
Oh... Oh!

46:17.205 --> 46:18.575
Cody, no!

46:25.214 --> 46:26.482
Look out!

46:26.515 --> 46:28.218
Wait for me, guys!

46:41.196 --> 46:42.598
You okay, Cody?

46:42.631 --> 46:43.566
Yeah.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.902
Fortunately,
this solid stone floor was here

46:45.935 --> 46:48.138
to break my fall.

46:48.171 --> 46:50.506
Where are the others?

46:53.642 --> 46:55.244
Whoa.

46:56.444 --> 46:59.682
Looks like
we're in some kind of a tomb.

46:59.714 --> 47:05.622
Yeah. Whoever these people were,
they really loved surfing.

47:05.655 --> 47:08.557
I think these little symbols
mean something.

47:09.392 --> 47:10.760
Maybe it's a story.

47:10.792 --> 47:12.294
Yeah, see?

47:12.327 --> 47:13.896
This one's about a guy
who surfed a wave

47:13.930 --> 47:15.665
as tall as a mountain.

47:16.865 --> 47:19.234
And this one shows a guy
surfing on sand.

47:19.267 --> 47:20.636
We did that.

47:20.669 --> 47:22.171
Hey, check it out.

47:22.205 --> 47:24.374
Whoa. What does it say?

47:24.406 --> 47:27.510
It looks like
the story of a young penguin.

47:27.542 --> 47:30.312
Pretty good surfer,
got some fans.

47:30.345 --> 47:32.915
Yeah, definitely looks like
things were going his way.

47:32.948 --> 47:35.284
Yeah, yeah, and then?

47:35.318 --> 47:38.187
Oh! He got eaten
by a bunch of sharks.

47:38.220 --> 47:39.856
Oh! Okay.

47:39.888 --> 47:41.191
Whoa.

47:41.223 --> 47:42.658
This guy surfed through fire?

47:42.691 --> 47:44.526
Dude, that's hardcore.

47:44.560 --> 47:49.366
Hey, this isn't a tomb.
It's a surfer's hall of fame.

47:50.298 --> 47:53.535
Oh, man.
This is so awesome. Wow!

47:53.568 --> 47:56.772
Do you think people
will remember you like that?

47:56.805 --> 48:00.242
A legendary surfer who did
all these amazing things?

48:00.276 --> 48:02.678
Jeez, I hope not.

48:02.711 --> 48:05.414
Really? What?
What are you talking about?

48:05.448 --> 48:06.848
This is what I've always wanted.

48:06.881 --> 48:09.551
To be remembered as a legend,
somebody respected.

48:09.584 --> 48:11.220
You know, like a real winner.

48:11.254 --> 48:12.455
Not me.

48:12.488 --> 48:14.691
I want to be remembered
for who I am,

48:14.723 --> 48:16.426
not what I did.

48:16.459 --> 48:18.661
Look, Cody,
surfing's awesome and all,

48:18.693 --> 48:21.330
but there are a lot
more important things in life.

48:21.363 --> 48:23.365
You'll see.

48:23.399 --> 48:25.635
I just want to be remembered.

48:35.644 --> 48:38.780
Lani, Lani, it's okay.
It's just me, love.

48:38.814 --> 48:40.516
- Paige.
- You all right?

48:40.548 --> 48:41.350
Yeah.

48:41.383 --> 48:42.351
Hello?

48:42.385 --> 48:46.723
Cody? Lani? Anyone?

48:46.756 --> 48:47.991
Conch?

48:48.024 --> 48:49.826
Chicken Joe?

48:49.859 --> 48:51.361
Uh-huh. It's me.

48:51.394 --> 48:53.729
Oi, over here.

48:53.763 --> 48:55.498
Is everyone okay?

48:55.531 --> 48:57.600
Uh-huh. Just me and the big guy.

48:57.633 --> 49:00.569
There's a little
doodle of a door on this wall.

49:00.602 --> 49:03.639
Do you guys see a lever
on your side?

49:03.673 --> 49:05.040
I see it.

49:11.013 --> 49:14.751
Whoa! Righteous door.

49:14.783 --> 49:16.653
Are we glad to see you guys.

49:16.685 --> 49:19.021
Come on, let's go.
Our friends might need help.

49:19.055 --> 49:21.725
Stop.
This place is dangerous.

49:25.560 --> 49:28.830
There are lost souls
lurking around every corner.

49:28.863 --> 49:34.036
I can feel them. They seem to be
guarding some kind of treasure.

49:35.470 --> 49:36.738
What kind of idiot

49:36.772 --> 49:39.075
would steal from a freaky place
like this?

49:39.107 --> 49:41.910
Ha, ha! I'm rich! I'm rich!

49:41.943 --> 49:43.512
Look at how rich I am.

49:43.546 --> 49:46.482
I wonder how much gold
we can pack on the whale.

49:46.515 --> 49:48.318
Let's come back
with a bigger whale.

49:48.350 --> 49:50.419
No, 10 whales.

50:01.497 --> 50:03.066
The conch says...

50:03.098 --> 50:05.401
There's no reception in here.
Ugh.

50:05.434 --> 50:07.870
Let me see
if I can get any bars.

50:09.071 --> 50:10.707
All right, there we go. Hmm.

50:10.740 --> 50:13.542
According to the conch,
the penguins on this island

50:13.575 --> 50:14.876
used to worship surfing.

50:14.910 --> 50:16.779
We're in the treasure room
of their king,

50:16.812 --> 50:18.548
the wealthiest surfer
who ever lived.

50:18.580 --> 50:23.653
Heh. A rich surfer?
Now I've seen everything.

50:23.685 --> 50:25.454
Mmm...

50:27.656 --> 50:29.992
Michelle, we have had
some good times together,

50:30.024 --> 50:34.696
but I think we both know
Tank Evans deserves better.

50:34.729 --> 50:38.100
Don't worry.
It's not me, it's you.

50:38.133 --> 50:41.536
Time to hit the road, babe.
Tank needs an upgrade.

50:41.569 --> 50:43.705
Hold on a second.
The conch tells me

50:43.738 --> 50:46.108
this place is booby-trapped
like crazy.

50:46.142 --> 50:49.011
We take anything, we die.

50:49.044 --> 50:51.547
What? That's too bad.

50:51.580 --> 50:54.150
Well, I didn't get into this
for the money.

50:54.182 --> 50:55.851
Easy come, easy go.

50:55.885 --> 50:58.888
Hey, Tank. Did you hear that?
Don't touch anything.

50:58.921 --> 51:00.490
This place is booby-trapped.

51:00.522 --> 51:01.758
Huh? Say what?

51:04.560 --> 51:06.996
Michelle! How could you?

51:07.028 --> 51:08.413
We've gotta get out.

51:08.414 --> 51:09.798
Let's go!

51:12.167 --> 51:13.803
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

51:13.836 --> 51:16.439
But let's not wait around
to find out.

51:17.506 --> 51:19.609
An old aqueduct.
That must lead outside.

51:19.642 --> 51:22.912
Come on, Cody.
It's our only shot.

51:30.185 --> 51:31.603
Whoa!

51:31.604 --> 51:33.021
Oh, yeah! Ha-ha-ha.

51:38.760 --> 51:39.904
Watch out for the darts!

51:39.928 --> 51:42.131
Shield yourself
with your boards.

51:42.164 --> 51:44.033
Stay together.

51:44.066 --> 51:45.033
Oh, look out!

51:45.066 --> 51:46.835
Ow!

51:48.803 --> 51:50.539
Aagh!

51:53.209 --> 51:54.210
Oh!

51:54.243 --> 51:55.545
Which way do we go?

51:55.577 --> 51:58.414
Follow me.
The conch knows the way.

52:05.687 --> 52:07.222
I hope Cody made it out.

52:07.256 --> 52:08.691
Don't worry, love.

52:08.723 --> 52:11.794
If we made it out,
they'll be fine.

52:13.696 --> 52:15.698
I love all you guys.

52:15.731 --> 52:16.531
Uh...

52:16.564 --> 52:18.166
Are you okay, big guy?

52:18.200 --> 52:21.636
I feel very peaceful.

52:21.669 --> 52:23.872
Must be the acupuncture.

52:27.243 --> 52:29.245
That's a pretty posh board,
Tank.

52:29.278 --> 52:30.646
What?

52:30.678 --> 52:32.247
You didn't take that, did you?

52:32.281 --> 52:34.617
No, no, no.
This is my old board. It just...

52:34.649 --> 52:37.919
Why all the fighting?

52:37.952 --> 52:39.755
There you are.

52:40.689 --> 52:43.024
Oh, Cody. You're okay!

52:43.057 --> 52:44.893
- Oh...
- Oh-ho.

52:44.926 --> 52:46.095
What's with him?

52:46.127 --> 52:48.798
Enjoy it while it lasts.

52:48.830 --> 52:51.700
See, this is the kind of
white-knuckle adventure

52:51.734 --> 52:54.504
the power diva is all about.

52:54.537 --> 52:57.640
Imagine, me and,
like, 11 of my besties

52:57.673 --> 52:59.908
<i>traveling the world
and kicking butt.</i>

52:59.941 --> 53:03.945
But also making time to hang out
by the pool and gossip.

53:03.979 --> 53:07.582
And at the end of every episode,
I'll slap somebody.

53:07.615 --> 53:09.918
It'll be a huge hit.

53:11.986 --> 53:14.990
Mm. Mm.

53:20.296 --> 53:22.265
Hey, guys. We found
some more firewood.

53:22.298 --> 53:24.566
Great. Have a seat.

53:24.600 --> 53:27.203
I saved you some dinner.

53:27.236 --> 53:28.871
Uh...

53:28.903 --> 53:30.205
Oops. My bad.

53:31.740 --> 53:33.642
Was I not supposed to eat that?
Heh-heh-heh.

53:33.676 --> 53:36.112
Aagh!
You knew that was for me, Tank.

53:36.144 --> 53:40.148
You snooze, you lose, bro.
Survival of the Tankiest.

53:40.182 --> 53:41.716
Came up with that myself.

53:41.749 --> 53:43.852
I may change it
to Hankiest later.

53:43.885 --> 53:44.853
Here, Cody.

53:44.886 --> 53:47.155
I picked these fish heads
out of the trash.

53:47.189 --> 53:50.593
I think there's still
some meat in this one.

53:50.626 --> 53:53.062
Nah, I got a better idea.

53:54.330 --> 53:56.766
Hey, what are you doing?

53:56.798 --> 53:58.900
Stop that! Hey, I mean it!

54:01.669 --> 54:03.104
You're dead.

54:03.138 --> 54:04.173
Yeah.

54:04.205 --> 54:05.173
Whoa!

54:05.207 --> 54:06.309
Uhn!

54:06.341 --> 54:07.709
Is that all you got?

54:07.743 --> 54:10.046
Ugh.
Kick his butt.

54:11.213 --> 54:12.615
Heh-heh-heh.

54:12.647 --> 54:15.651
Ugh! Whoa, whoa, wh...! Ow!

54:15.684 --> 54:18.821
Whoops! Sorry.
Just stretching my calf muscle.

54:18.854 --> 54:20.289
Ha, ha!
How do you like that?

54:20.321 --> 54:21.723
Ooh, my tushy!

54:21.756 --> 54:22.992
Not cool, bro.

54:23.024 --> 54:24.793
You can't trip my guy like that.

54:24.827 --> 54:26.796
Oh, yeah?
What do you wanna do about it?

54:26.828 --> 54:27.964
It's been a while, dude.

54:27.997 --> 54:29.598
You think
you can still handle it?

54:29.631 --> 54:32.367
Come on now, you can't see me.

54:32.401 --> 54:35.104
Yeah. I want a piece.

54:36.205 --> 54:37.173
Ow.

54:37.205 --> 54:38.307
Yeah! Take this.

54:38.339 --> 54:39.641
Whoo!

54:39.642 --> 54:40.943
All right. Enough.

54:42.176 --> 54:44.245
It's supposed to be
their fight, remember?

54:46.247 --> 54:47.950
Yeah!

54:47.982 --> 54:51.821
One, two, three. That's it.
We have a winner.

54:51.854 --> 54:54.689
Ha! I kicked your butt
with my butt.

54:54.722 --> 54:55.890
Oh, that smells.

54:55.923 --> 54:57.102
That was fun. Let me know

54:57.126 --> 54:58.794
when you're ready for a rematch.

54:58.827 --> 55:00.629
I leave you
alone for 10 minutes,

55:00.662 --> 55:01.930
and this is what you do?

55:01.964 --> 55:04.200
I expect rookie mistakes
from rookies,

55:04.232 --> 55:06.102
but you guys know better.

55:06.135 --> 55:07.736
And, Cody Maverick,

55:07.769 --> 55:09.237
we'll never get to the Trenches

55:09.271 --> 55:12.140
if you keep starting fights
with your teammates.

55:12.173 --> 55:14.275
Ah! Yeah. Ha, ha!

55:15.778 --> 55:19.348
Oh, wait.
Are we not doing this anymore?

55:19.381 --> 55:21.250
Oh, my bad.

55:21.283 --> 55:24.787
So other than getting sat on,

55:24.819 --> 55:25.997
how do you think you're doing?

55:26.021 --> 55:27.890
Okay,
that was not my fault, man.

55:27.923 --> 55:29.125
Hunter called it too early.

55:29.158 --> 55:31.260
I had Tank
right where I wanted him.

55:31.292 --> 55:32.428
Uh-huh. Ha, ha.

55:32.461 --> 55:33.928
Where, on your head?

55:33.961 --> 55:35.964
That's besides the point,
all right? Okay?

55:35.997 --> 55:37.932
Anyways,
my head is still in the game,

55:37.966 --> 55:39.268
if that's what you're asking.

55:39.301 --> 55:41.370
This is my one big chance
to get off Pen Gu

55:41.403 --> 55:43.004
and make something of myself.

55:43.037 --> 55:45.340
I'm gonna show the Hang 5
I've got what it takes.

55:45.374 --> 55:48.144
And I've been working out too.
Check this out. Can you tell?

55:49.912 --> 55:51.446
Uh! Oh...

55:51.479 --> 55:53.381
Oh, okay.

55:53.414 --> 55:56.118
Can you please go get J.C.?

56:02.156 --> 56:03.425
Cock-a-doodle...

56:03.459 --> 56:06.361
You're gambling
with your life, chicken.

56:10.466 --> 56:13.868
Uh-huh. Right, yeah.

56:13.901 --> 56:15.771
Uh-huh. Okay, got it.

56:15.803 --> 56:17.106
Good news, everyone.

56:17.138 --> 56:18.073
According to the conch,

56:18.106 --> 56:20.709
we might reach the Trenches
by nightfall.

56:20.743 --> 56:24.046
Then tomorrow morning, it's RTL.

56:24.078 --> 56:25.314
- RTL!
- RTL!

56:25.347 --> 56:28.350
Is anyone ever gonna tell us
what that means?

56:28.383 --> 56:31.187
What? And ruin the surprise?

56:31.220 --> 56:33.789
Hey, guys. You might
want to look at this.

56:33.821 --> 56:36.091
Anyone else get the feeling

56:36.124 --> 56:39.828
this island really doesn't want
us to reach the Trenches?

56:45.834 --> 56:48.037
Ideas, anybody?

56:49.271 --> 56:51.906
We sure didn't come this far
to give up now.

56:51.939 --> 56:54.008
The conch says
unless we can surf on fire,

56:54.042 --> 56:56.078
we'll have to find
another way around.

56:56.111 --> 56:59.915
But this lava lake is huge.

57:00.848 --> 57:02.852
Come on, Cody.

57:05.086 --> 57:06.855
Surf...

57:07.555 --> 57:09.824
on fire. Hey.

57:09.857 --> 57:11.093
Hey. Hey, guys, wait.

57:11.126 --> 57:13.028
When we were stuck in that tomb,

57:13.060 --> 57:14.896
I saw some drawings
about a penguin

57:14.930 --> 57:16.198
who surfed through fire.

57:16.231 --> 57:18.200
I thought it was just a cool
made-up story,

57:18.232 --> 57:19.468
but what if it's not?

57:19.501 --> 57:21.504
What if somebody
actually did it?

57:21.537 --> 57:23.038
I have an idea.

57:23.071 --> 57:25.341
It's crazy,
but I think it just might work.

57:25.374 --> 57:26.776
Spit it out, kid.

57:26.809 --> 57:29.410
Undertaker, quick,
give me a boost.

57:33.881 --> 57:35.416
Who's up
for some hang-gliding?

57:35.450 --> 57:36.852
Yeah! That's awesome! Yeah!

57:36.853 --> 57:38.254
Let's go! Let's do it!

57:38.287 --> 57:39.287
All right!

58:01.577 --> 58:04.379
Hey, Cody. Nice job coming up
with the idea

58:04.412 --> 58:05.548
for these hang gliders.

58:05.580 --> 58:07.149
This is the kind of creative,

58:07.182 --> 58:10.051
out-of-the-box thinking
we need in Hang 5.

58:10.084 --> 58:11.352
Ha, ha! Thanks, guys.

58:11.385 --> 58:13.054
This is what I've been talking
about.

58:13.088 --> 58:15.423
I've got all kinds of ideas.

58:15.457 --> 58:17.259
Like dolphin-powered
jet skis.

58:17.292 --> 58:19.895
Underwater breathing devices.
Hey, wait.

58:19.928 --> 58:22.298
What if we put wheels
on our surfboards

58:22.330 --> 58:25.401
so we can surf
on dry land, huh? Yeah?

58:25.434 --> 58:30.039
Whoa, wheels on a surfboard?
Let's not get too crazy here.

58:30.071 --> 58:32.473
Keep up the good work.

58:33.941 --> 58:35.176
Did you see that?

58:35.209 --> 58:37.178
I'm gonna be in the Hang 5
for sure.

58:37.211 --> 58:39.113
So who's the loser now, huh?

58:39.147 --> 58:42.184
Whatever, chump.
It ain't over yet.

58:42.216 --> 58:44.919
Oh, not according to
Mr. McMahon and Hunter.

58:44.952 --> 58:46.955
You better start
packing your bags, Tank.

58:46.988 --> 58:49.390
Because tomorrow,
I'm gonna be part of the Hang 5.

58:49.423 --> 58:52.360
Traveling the world,
doing the most radical stuff.

58:52.394 --> 58:55.598
And you'll just go back to being
a nobody from nowhere island.

58:55.631 --> 58:59.201
And you'll never see me again.

58:59.234 --> 59:00.336
What?

59:00.368 --> 59:03.571
You don't wanna go back
to Pen Gu?

59:03.604 --> 59:05.473
What about our surf school?

59:05.506 --> 59:07.108
Lani, come on.

59:07.142 --> 59:09.944
It's the Hang 5, okay?
I'm gonna be famous.

59:09.977 --> 59:12.213
I'll be a hero
to millions of kids.

59:12.247 --> 59:15.651
But you're already a hero
to the kids back home.

59:15.684 --> 59:17.386
And to me.

59:17.419 --> 59:20.321
This is different.
Can't you see that?

59:20.354 --> 59:22.523
I'll be on the best surf team
on the planet.

59:22.557 --> 59:26.127
I'll finally <i> be</i> somebody.
That's what really matters.

59:26.160 --> 59:28.363
Hey, Cody. Check
out my glider, dude.

59:28.397 --> 59:30.099
Coming, J.C.

59:30.131 --> 59:33.336
Come show me how this thing's
supposed to work. Ha-ha-ha.

59:34.535 --> 59:36.472
Eh...
Come on, Joe. Let's go.

59:36.504 --> 59:41.276
I guess we're just a couple
of nobodies from nowhere island.

59:50.519 --> 59:51.986
Let's be safe, guys.

59:52.019 --> 59:53.655
This ain't the ocean.

59:53.689 --> 59:55.124
If you wipe out up here,

59:55.156 --> 59:57.459
you'll be a bucket
of extra crispy.

59:57.492 --> 01:00:02.097
Oh, man. Just like my uncle,
Chicken Fernando.

01:00:02.129 --> 01:00:05.667
You're going down, twerp.
No more Mr. Nice Tank.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.336
You are not gonna take my spot
on the Hang 5.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.673
Okay, let's see what you got.

01:00:10.705 --> 01:00:12.573
On your mark.

01:00:17.044 --> 01:00:18.213
Get ready.

01:00:19.314 --> 01:00:21.283
- Hey, watch it, man.
- Heh-heh-heh.

01:00:21.316 --> 01:00:22.417
Go!

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:23.985
Yeah!

01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:25.587
Oh.

01:00:28.122 --> 01:00:30.191
Hot, hot, hot.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:32.394
J.C. Whoo-hoo!

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:33.495
All right!

01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:47.209
Ugh.

01:00:50.312 --> 01:00:52.415
Loving the lava.

01:01:08.763 --> 01:01:10.198
There you are.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.236
You're gonna eat it, Tank.

01:01:14.269 --> 01:01:16.114
- Show me what you got.
- That's not nice.

01:01:16.138 --> 01:01:17.515
- You like that?
- Stop that.

01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:18.874
Hey, that's not fair. Whoa!

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.209
This is fun.

01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:24.613
Huh?

01:01:24.646 --> 01:01:26.749
Wait, I'm first?
Ha-ha-ha!

01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:28.149
I'm first.

01:01:28.182 --> 01:01:29.484
Payback time. Ha-ha-ha!

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.785
Oh!

01:01:30.818 --> 01:01:34.622
Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:34.656 --> 01:01:35.758
Whoa!

01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:37.359
Grr...

01:01:38.459 --> 01:01:41.429
Oh, you are not taking this
away from me, Tank.

01:01:42.696 --> 01:01:44.466
- Got you.
- What are you doing?

01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:47.101
Whoa! Whoa!

01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:48.669
How do you like me now?

01:01:48.702 --> 01:01:51.205
Oof! Aaah!

01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:54.609
I don't want to be a combo meal!

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.381
Hang on, Joe!
I got you, buddy.

01:02:03.517 --> 01:02:07.389
Whoa. My board. No!

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:16.665
All right!

01:02:16.698 --> 01:02:20.569
Who's awesome? I'm awesome.

01:02:22.203 --> 01:02:23.571
What's going on, everyone?

01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:27.809
The Undertaker saved me
from death.

01:02:27.843 --> 01:02:29.778
Ironic.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.412
Where's your board?

01:02:31.446 --> 01:02:34.283
You destroyed it
when you bumped Tank into Joe.

01:02:34.316 --> 01:02:37.553
What? Joe, man, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...

01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:40.722
"Sorry" doesn't cut it, Cody.
What the heck were you thinking?

01:02:40.754 --> 01:02:43.325
Yeah, man.
What'd I ever do to you?

01:02:43.357 --> 01:02:45.727
All these years of friendship.
And he still...

01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:49.564
He still keeps these...
These walls up.

01:02:49.597 --> 01:02:52.333
And I don't know
how to break them down.

01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:57.205
I just don't know
what to think anymore.

01:02:57.238 --> 01:02:58.573
Are you kidding me, dude?

01:02:58.606 --> 01:03:01.576
This guy has been sabotaging me
since day one.

01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:03.578
And you think
that makes it okay?

01:03:03.611 --> 01:03:05.580
Well, I... Yeah.

01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:06.881
I was just trying to win.

01:03:06.914 --> 01:03:08.550
So I could prove
I can be one of you.

01:03:08.582 --> 01:03:11.119
Putting your friends in danger
only proves

01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:12.354
that you're nothing like us.

01:03:12.386 --> 01:03:14.189
The Hang 5 is a family.

01:03:14.222 --> 01:03:18.227
We have each other's back,
no matter what.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.595
Lani. Tell them I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:03:20.629 --> 01:03:22.131
All right? You know me.

01:03:22.164 --> 01:03:23.732
Yeah, Cody, I do.

01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:27.769
And that's why I'm just so
disappointed in you right now.

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:36.644
And you were doing so well too.

01:03:50.792 --> 01:03:53.896
I told you from the
start this kid's trouble.

01:03:53.928 --> 01:03:55.763
He almost got the chicken
killed.

01:03:55.796 --> 01:03:57.465
That would have been on you,
J.C.

01:03:57.499 --> 01:03:59.501
Cody's not like that,
Mr. McMahon.

01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:01.769
He just got carried away
competing with Tank.

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:05.174
That guy's been acting
like a jerk this whole time.

01:04:05.207 --> 01:04:07.376
I wanted to know
how Cody deals with problems

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:09.243
since you thought
he was special.

01:04:09.276 --> 01:04:11.379
And now I know.
We're a team, J.C.

01:04:11.412 --> 01:04:14.482
That kid doesn't care about
anything other than winning.

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:15.917
And he doesn't give
two sand crabs

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.519
about who gets in his way.

01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:20.254
Maybe that's what you saw in him
back at Pen Gu.

01:04:20.287 --> 01:04:21.623
Have you thought about that?

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:56.558
Cock-a...

01:04:56.591 --> 01:04:57.526
Oh, no.

01:04:57.559 --> 01:04:59.560
You guys, come look at this.

01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:05.867
"Joe, sorry for everything.
You deserve this more than me.

01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:07.903
Your bro, Cody."

01:05:07.935 --> 01:05:13.242
Ha-ha-ha! What a stupid note.
"You deserve this more than me."

01:05:13.274 --> 01:05:14.575
Hey, is anybody else surprised

01:05:14.609 --> 01:05:16.444
Chicken Joe can read?
Ha-ha-ha!

01:05:18.412 --> 01:05:19.580
We have to find Cody.

01:05:19.613 --> 01:05:21.482
He couldn't have gotten
that far.

01:05:21.515 --> 01:05:24.385
That was pretty sad, bro.

01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:26.254
Lani, wait.

01:05:26.287 --> 01:05:28.356
I think you gotta let Cody

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:30.325
work things out on his own.

01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:32.394
He'll come back when he's ready.

01:05:32.426 --> 01:05:34.296
But how can you be sure?

01:05:34.328 --> 01:05:36.330
I've been where he's at.

01:05:36.363 --> 01:05:39.568
Trust me.
He just needs time to think.

01:05:43.437 --> 01:05:46.907
Hmm. It's time we haul our butts
down to the Trenches.

01:05:46.941 --> 01:05:49.477
The best waves come at dawn.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.713
Uh, does anyone else think
a storm is coming?

01:05:52.747 --> 01:05:55.884
We're counting on it.

01:05:55.917 --> 01:05:58.854
Oh, cool. Right on, then.

01:06:15.336 --> 01:06:16.838
Whoa!

01:06:22.676 --> 01:06:27.783
"Here lies the great hero
of Slaughter Island,

01:06:27.816 --> 01:06:32.288
"the bravest
and most honored surfer of all.

01:06:37.392 --> 01:06:41.797
"He gave up his chance
at fame and fortune,

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:45.534
"and he chose to stay
with his people to protect them

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:48.002
"from the treacherous waters
of the Trenches

01:06:48.035 --> 01:06:54.608
by performing the sacred rites
of Ride the Lightning."

01:06:54.642 --> 01:06:55.711
RTL.

01:06:57.412 --> 01:07:00.683
Oh, no.
I gotta tell Lani and Joe.

01:07:15.597 --> 01:07:16.899
Whoa!

01:07:24.472 --> 01:07:27.142
My friends, we finally made it.

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:29.910
Behold, the Trenches.

01:07:47.428 --> 01:07:50.398
Whoa. Look at all these
broken surfboards.

01:07:50.432 --> 01:07:52.834
Must have been
some major wipeouts.

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:56.604
I'm not gonna end up like them.
I'm way better than those guys.

01:07:56.638 --> 01:07:58.673
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07:58.705 --> 01:08:01.142
the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:08:08.048 --> 01:08:11.419
Hang 5, prepare to RTL!

01:08:11.452 --> 01:08:13.788
RTL!

01:08:14.823 --> 01:08:15.790
Wait a minute.

01:08:15.823 --> 01:08:16.890
Are you telling me

01:08:16.925 --> 01:08:19.060
that RTL stands for...

01:08:19.091 --> 01:08:21.895
Ride the Lightning.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:25.801
Whoa! Wicked timing
on that delivery, bro.

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:27.836
Surfing
during a lightning storm?

01:08:27.868 --> 01:08:29.638
You actually planned for this?

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:32.173
Are you guys completely insane?

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:33.607
Well, yeah.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.176
We figured you knew that
about us.

01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:38.845
Lani, we're all about pushing
ourselves to the absolute limit.

01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:41.682
And it doesn't get
any more extreme than this.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:45.020
I'm sorry, you guys.
I can't do this.

01:08:45.051 --> 01:08:48.555
Thank you for the opportunity,
but no, thank you.

01:08:48.589 --> 01:08:49.890
This isn't for me.

01:08:49.923 --> 01:08:52.993
Hey, we understand, love.
No hard feelings.

01:08:53.026 --> 01:08:54.729
What about you, Chicken?

01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:58.934
Are you ready
for a spot on the Hang 5?

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:02.237
I don't think I'm quite ready
for that big chicken bucket

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.205
up in the sky just yet.

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:05.607
Oh, hey.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.944
How about
an honorary membership?

01:09:08.975 --> 01:09:11.578
Heh-heh-heh. You got it.

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.587
So how about it, Tank?

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:20.888
So, uh, all I gotta do is surf

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:22.474
one gigantic 50-foot wave.

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:24.024
Yup.

01:09:24.057 --> 01:09:26.993
It's in the middle of
a lightning-filled thunderstorm.

01:09:27.028 --> 01:09:28.194
Oh, yeah.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.830
Also off a beach

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:31.265
littered with jagged coral reef.

01:09:31.298 --> 01:09:32.734
Exactly.

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:34.667
But then I'm in the Hang 5

01:09:34.702 --> 01:09:36.246
and I'll be famous
and make lots of money

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:38.005
selling surf videos.

01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:41.274
You gotta do more than surf it,
you gotta survive it.

01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:43.611
And make it look good.

01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.848
You in or you out?

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.684
Um... In?

01:09:49.716 --> 01:09:52.854
In. I'm definitely in.
This is a good decision.

01:09:52.886 --> 01:09:54.256
Sweet. Headbutt for good luck.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.624
Oh!

01:09:55.656 --> 01:09:58.526
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna miss that if I die.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.895
Then let's RTL.

01:09:59.927 --> 01:10:01.095
RTL!

01:10:01.128 --> 01:10:03.832
Sweet! Yeah!

01:10:03.864 --> 01:10:05.666
I can't watch.

01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:07.167
But I can't not watch.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:08.869
I'm a lifeguard, Joe.

01:10:08.903 --> 01:10:11.272
I'm supposed to protect
all beachgoers.

01:10:11.306 --> 01:10:13.775
I swore a Hippocratic oath.

01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:17.044
Hah. Hippos. They're rad.

01:10:23.985 --> 01:10:26.555
Are you sure we have
to paddle out this far?

01:10:26.587 --> 01:10:27.788
It seems far.

01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:29.857
I can't even see the beach
from here.

01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:31.793
All right,
here's how this works.

01:10:31.825 --> 01:10:33.962
Don't panic. Work as a team.

01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:36.297
And keep an eye out
for each other.

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:38.266
And we'll all
make it through this.

01:10:38.298 --> 01:10:40.668
Whoa!

01:10:40.702 --> 01:10:41.703
Here we go, Tank.

01:10:41.735 --> 01:10:43.704
This is your last test.

01:10:43.738 --> 01:10:46.240
Mr. McMahon thinks
you're a yellow-bellied coward.

01:10:46.274 --> 01:10:47.842
- But I told him
- What?

01:10:47.874 --> 01:10:50.645
You were the real deal.
Don't let me down, Tank.

01:10:50.677 --> 01:10:52.680
Or we'll all die.

01:10:52.713 --> 01:10:56.818
Do not... I repeat,
do not go rogue out there.

01:10:56.851 --> 01:10:59.054
We're all counting
on each other. Got it?

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.622
Okay, here it comes!

01:11:01.655 --> 01:11:03.158
- Yes!
- All right!

01:11:06.793 --> 01:11:09.263
Come on, Tank. It's go time.

01:11:13.001 --> 01:11:14.802
Everybody, ready?

01:11:14.836 --> 01:11:17.071
Yeah, I was born ready!

01:11:17.105 --> 01:11:18.673
Oh, yeah!

01:11:21.876 --> 01:11:22.977
Whoa!

01:11:29.182 --> 01:11:31.118
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Come on.

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.860
This is the moment
we've been waiting for!

01:11:39.894 --> 01:11:42.396
Whoa, this is amazing!

01:11:43.998 --> 01:11:45.232
Let's ride!

01:11:45.266 --> 01:11:46.935
Yeah!

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:55.142
- No way, man.
- Whoa!

01:11:55.176 --> 01:11:56.144
No, I can't do it.

01:11:56.177 --> 01:11:57.345
Tank, don't!

01:12:01.748 --> 01:12:04.985
Stay in formation.
It's the only way.

01:12:14.328 --> 01:12:16.196
Don't let it touch you.

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:17.399
Unh!

01:12:17.431 --> 01:12:19.934
Undertaker, I'm coming for you.

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.002
Look out!

01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:22.269
We're not gonna make it!

01:12:33.413 --> 01:12:37.184
Help!
I got him, he's been hit.

01:12:39.052 --> 01:12:42.056
Move aside! I can save him.

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:46.695
Oh, I hope I'm not too late.

01:12:56.471 --> 01:12:58.906
Whoa!
Good to get out of that mess.

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.276
Oh, crap.

01:13:03.477 --> 01:13:05.180
No! Aah!

01:13:08.216 --> 01:13:10.819
Ah. Ooh!

01:13:11.452 --> 01:13:12.452
No!

01:13:14.821 --> 01:13:18.059
Oh, man. This thing
is like a lightning rod.

01:13:18.092 --> 01:13:19.092
No!

01:13:22.230 --> 01:13:23.832
Help!

01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:29.337
Tank! Hang on, I'm coming.

01:13:37.410 --> 01:13:39.247
Hunter!

01:13:40.181 --> 01:13:42.484
Hunter, Hanky needs you.

01:13:47.154 --> 01:13:47.922
Hold on.

01:13:47.955 --> 01:13:50.190
Oh, this is a bad idea,
Maverick.

01:13:50.223 --> 01:13:51.191
Stop fidgeting.

01:13:51.225 --> 01:13:53.061
Go left. Go right.

01:13:53.093 --> 01:13:54.229
You're doing it all wrong.

01:13:54.262 --> 01:13:57.232
Enough with the backseat
surfing, okay?

01:13:57.265 --> 01:13:59.868
My mom's gonna be
so mad at you if we die.

01:14:11.012 --> 01:14:12.380
Come on.

01:14:21.254 --> 01:14:22.757
No.

01:14:29.931 --> 01:14:32.534
Hang on, Under-bro.

01:14:32.566 --> 01:14:34.468
Clear.

01:14:34.502 --> 01:14:36.905
Aaagh!

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:44.245
Now, that was gnarly.

01:14:44.278 --> 01:14:45.913
You did it.

01:14:45.914 --> 01:14:47.548
Oh, dude. Welcome back.

01:14:47.582 --> 01:14:49.017
You okay, big guy?

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:53.087
Forget about me.
Go help them.

01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:56.941
Ugh.

01:14:56.942 --> 01:14:58.293
What happened to you?

01:14:58.325 --> 01:14:59.426
He came back.

01:15:00.595 --> 01:15:02.864
He risked his life to save Tank.

01:15:06.499 --> 01:15:08.837
Oh!
You could have been killed.

01:15:08.869 --> 01:15:10.571
Yeah, I know.

01:15:10.605 --> 01:15:12.373
But it's like you said, J.C.

01:15:12.405 --> 01:15:16.144
We have each other's back,
no matter what.

01:15:21.015 --> 01:15:23.318
I think you have something
to say to Cody.

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:28.323
Thanks, Maverick. Um...

01:15:28.355 --> 01:15:30.624
So are we... Are we cool?

01:15:30.658 --> 01:15:33.194
Uh...

01:15:33.226 --> 01:15:34.328
Yeah, we're cool.

01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.930
Awesome. We should hang out.

01:15:35.962 --> 01:15:37.331
We should totally hang out.

01:15:38.098 --> 01:15:41.369
Not bad. Not bad at all.

01:15:41.401 --> 01:15:43.971
That's what I saw in him.

01:15:46.406 --> 01:15:48.376
Cody Maverick,

01:15:48.409 --> 01:15:50.846
you're one bodacious surfer.

01:15:51.979 --> 01:15:55.415
But even more importantly,
a good dude.

01:15:55.449 --> 01:15:57.185
On behalf of the Hang 5,

01:15:57.217 --> 01:16:00.020
we'd be honored
to have you join us.

01:16:01.388 --> 01:16:03.056
Gnarly.

01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:11.900
Joining the Hang 5
would be the biggest honor

01:16:11.932 --> 01:16:16.370
of my entire life.
But I... I have to decline.

01:16:16.404 --> 01:16:17.504
No.

01:16:17.538 --> 01:16:18.673
Wait, what?

01:16:18.705 --> 01:16:20.941
Dude, are you sure?

01:16:20.975 --> 01:16:22.977
Yeah, bro. I am.

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:25.113
All this time,
I thought joining the Hang 5,

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:27.915
the greatest surf team,
would make me a somebody.

01:16:27.949 --> 01:16:29.684
A winner
that everyone respected.

01:16:29.717 --> 01:16:32.654
But now I know I'm already part
of a great team.

01:16:32.686 --> 01:16:34.988
With the coolest chicken
of the sea.

01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:38.025
And the best, raddest surfer
on Pen Gu.

01:16:38.726 --> 01:16:40.395
Tank?

01:16:42.296 --> 01:16:44.966
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:16:46.132 --> 01:16:49.937
Friendship is truly
the universe's

01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:52.006
most precious gift.

01:16:52.038 --> 01:16:56.410
But what does this mean for us?
Now we're one member short.

01:16:56.444 --> 01:16:57.712
I'm staying.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:58.980
Really?

01:16:59.012 --> 01:17:01.015
Yeah, our adventures
are too much fun.

01:17:01.047 --> 01:17:03.150
Who wants to just drink
fish milk coladas

01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:05.186
on the beach all day anyways?

01:17:06.052 --> 01:17:07.154
Hey, you guys know

01:17:07.187 --> 01:17:08.623
what we've never done before?

01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:10.992
Surfed during a tsunami.
Who's up for it?

01:17:11.025 --> 01:17:12.043
Yeah!

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.061
All right!

01:17:14.462 --> 01:17:15.663
Dude.

01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:17.164
Ride the RTS.

01:17:17.198 --> 01:17:19.133
Tsunami starts with a T, boss.

01:17:19.165 --> 01:17:23.238
Oh, yeah. Ride the RTT. Ha, ha!

01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:28.309
Uh-huh. Yeah? Yeah? Whoa.

01:17:28.342 --> 01:17:31.612
So <i> that's</i> why
everything tastes like me.

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:33.381
Thanks, dude.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:40.153
All right,

01:17:40.186 --> 01:17:42.990
<i>Are They Still Cool?</i>
Surf Edition, take two.

01:17:43.024 --> 01:17:45.126
Can you tell us
what you've been up to

01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:46.361
for the last couple years?

01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:48.229
Oh, it's been a crazy ride, man.

01:17:48.262 --> 01:17:50.598
But first,
I have a question for you.

01:17:50.631 --> 01:17:52.600
Oh, no. Not again. Come on.

01:17:52.632 --> 01:17:56.069
We're not gonna finish the show
if you keep changing the script.

01:17:56.102 --> 01:17:58.338
Are you a fan
of the legendary Hang 5?

01:17:58.372 --> 01:17:59.707
Wanna learn extreme surf moves

01:17:59.739 --> 01:18:01.541
like the tombstone pile driver

01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:02.574
from the Undertaker?

01:18:03.744 --> 01:18:05.513
What about Paige's PTO?

01:18:05.546 --> 01:18:07.749
Well, you can learn those
and many more

01:18:07.781 --> 01:18:09.249
from Pen Gu Surf Academy.

01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:11.686
At PSA,
you'll learn how to have fun,

01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:14.087
be safe and surf like a pro.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.025
Just like my friends,
Cody, Lani and Chicken Joe.

01:18:17.057 --> 01:18:18.325
Mention this commercial

01:18:18.359 --> 01:18:20.461
and receive a free case
of fresh fish milk

01:18:20.494 --> 01:18:21.462
with your membership.

01:18:21.494 --> 01:18:22.095
Ugh.

01:18:22.128 --> 01:18:24.631
So stop by the North Shore

01:18:24.664 --> 01:18:25.699
and hang out with us.

01:18:25.732 --> 01:18:27.368
That's Pen Gu Surf Academy.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.537
Where the sun never sets.

01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:33.173
Okay. That's
a wrap on this episode

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:35.510
of <i> Are They Still Cool?</i>
Surf Edition.

01:18:35.543 --> 01:18:37.278
And cut.

01:18:50.591 --> 01:18:53.127
You should learn to surf
from a real master.

01:18:53.159 --> 01:18:55.095
- Right, gang?
- Yes, sensei.

01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:56.363
Ow! Oh, oh, oh...

01:19:07.141 --> 01:19:10.178
I'll also teach you
about teamwork

01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:12.413
and proper surf etiquette!

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:14.682
Okay, cut.

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.783
Wait, stop.

01:19:15.815 --> 01:19:18.086
Stop.

01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:20.154
Yeah. Whoo!

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:34.868
We'll be there in
four, three, two... Oh! Oh!

01:19:47.515 --> 01:19:49.883
I picked this up for you
while I was on tour.

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:51.319
Thanks, Joe! Ha-ha-ha!

01:19:51.351 --> 01:19:53.386
