Heavenly Father, thank you for saving us

00:29.600 --> 00:31.760
by the blood of the Lamb,
your son, Jesus Christ.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.560
Without you we are nothing but sinners.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.480
Thank you for unity, yes, Lord.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.640
Thank you, Jesus.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.080
My mum was going to call me Alyssa
which means "sweet angel" in Indian,

00:48.160 --> 00:50.800
but when I come out, she looked at me
and she called me Tracey.

00:52.000 --> 00:52.960
"Tracey"...

00:53.720 --> 00:56.600
I mean, sounds like I eat bacon sarnies
or have sex at the back of the bus,

00:56.680 --> 00:57.920
I don't eat pork, man,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.400
and I don't even want to have sex
with my boyfriend in a bedroom.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.040
Excuse me, I'm... I'm trying to pray
with my life partner, so...

01:04.600 --> 01:08.120
...For keeping Tracey and I united
in six years of courtship.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.400
For preserving our virginity thus far...

01:12.480 --> 01:13.480
-Yes, Lord.
-[Ron moans]

01:14.040 --> 01:15.080
Yes, Lord.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.880
Oh, Ron!

01:23.080 --> 01:24.600
-Yeah.
-Oh, wow!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.080
For preserving our virginity thus far.

01:29.920 --> 01:36.240
Your word says a whore is a deep ditch
and a strange woman is a narrow pit...

01:36.920 --> 01:38.560
-[moans]
-...to stay virginal

01:39.040 --> 01:41.240
till marriage and we will wait

01:42.720 --> 01:45.240
until we die if it brings you glory.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
Amen.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
Amen!

01:50.200 --> 01:51.600
-Tracey?
-[both moaning]

01:52.160 --> 01:53.160
Amen.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.560
-Tired already.
-Its only gone 12.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.960
Probably going to have a nap now,

02:06.040 --> 02:07.600
[sighs] You always nap when I'm here.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.520
Yeah. I told you
it's because of my, um, my, uh...

02:10.680 --> 02:12.480
-Your anemia, yeah.
-Mmm.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.840
I just really like spending time with you.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.560
-Hey, chin up!
-[Tracey chuckles]

02:17.840 --> 02:19.360
-Where's the chin?
-Here's the chin.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.320
-There's the chin. Good.
-There it is.

02:21.720 --> 02:24.360
-Don't be desperate.
-No, don't be desperate, sorry.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.960
Yeah. [chuckles]

02:38.480 --> 02:41.560
Sometimes he just lets me stay
and watch him sleep.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.800
I could never let him do that,
'cause when I sleep I get wet dreams.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.440
<i>I'll just be having</i>
<i>a normal kind of sexy dream.</i>

02:48.520 --> 02:50.000
Oh, Jay Z, don't you dare!

02:50.080 --> 02:52.360
<i>It gets too intense. And then...</i>

02:53.800 --> 02:56.600
<i>I squirt blood, out my nostrils.</i>

03:05.320 --> 03:07.240

03:18.280 --> 03:21.760

03:22.280 --> 03:24.640
-Ah!
-What is he doing?

03:25.120 --> 03:26.720
-The universe...
-Who are you talking to?

03:28.720 --> 03:29.560
Wow!

03:30.200 --> 03:31.600
-Nah, I'm, uh...
-[cellphone rings]

03:34.560 --> 03:37.480
I'm writing my poetry. What the fuck, man?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.720
Listen, delete me from your contact.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.280
Delete me from your contact. Mum!

03:50.240 --> 03:54.440
-You got a shift in the shop, yeah?
-Yeah, yeah. Later.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.720
Yeah, I've seen you with the hat.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.840
You sort of look like a maid,

04:00.600 --> 04:03.880
like a modern,
liberated slave sort of thing.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.600
No, that doesn't...

04:06.840 --> 04:09.680
Um... when you wear the hat...

04:10.320 --> 04:12.840
I like... you're not my maid,
you're not a maid...

04:13.720 --> 04:15.480
-I like you.
-[chuckles]

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
I like the shop hat...

04:17.840 --> 04:18.760
Ugh.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.000
-Wh-what are you doing?
-Letting you in.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.840
Um, cool. Cool. Excuse me.

04:31.920 --> 04:33.200
[door squeaks]

04:33.320 --> 04:34.360
Go on then.

-[fading footsteps]

04:52.600 --> 04:53.840
You hearing me?

04:54.240 --> 04:57.200
Listen, mate. You're definitely
missing my party to break your hymen.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.080
It's just dinner with Ronald.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.720
-You have a party every week.
-I ain't even upset, I'm proud.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.280
It's time.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.960
Candice, I'm 24, I'm a virgin, yes,

05:06.040 --> 05:08.560
that doesn't mean I have to want to
have sex with my boyfriend, yeah?

05:08.640 --> 05:11.400
You don't have to,
you can bang someone on Tinder, it's free!

05:11.680 --> 05:14.200
Set the thing to find someone
in your borough and walk.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.920
A Tinder bang isn't even bus fare, bruv!

05:18.320 --> 05:22.160
Candice is like the buffest girl I've ever
seen on the whole of my estate,

05:22.240 --> 05:25.600
but she's got learning difficulties
so it sort of balances it out,

05:25.800 --> 05:28.800
so like, I can be best friends with her,
and I'm not jealous or anything.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.240
You know if you leave it too long,

05:30.760 --> 05:32.800
it'll tear when he enters you,
you'll need stitches.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.880
Well, thank God for the NHS, then, innit?

05:35.840 --> 05:38.960
Babe, let me give you a makeover,
you won't get the D looking like that.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.560
Candice, I don't want the D
or one of your makeovers.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.680
All right, as long as you aren't lying
to yourself.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.240
Sex is overrated anyway.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.440
Yeah, it's good when it's good,
but it's never...

05:48.760 --> 05:50.440
exciting, like it's never a thrill...

05:50.680 --> 05:53.000
Is it, um, Aaron?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.680
He's very, you know, he's very...

05:55.840 --> 05:57.600
-[bed squeaking]
-[moans]

05:57.760 --> 05:59.320
-I love you.
-I love you too.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.600
-You are an emblem of the sun.
-Emblem of the sun, yeah, I know.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.880
You're my feeling of conscious presence.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.280
-I want him to have a firmer hand...
-'Course, man.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.960
-I want him to hold me down.
-He's got to be there for you, man.

06:10.120 --> 06:14.000
With his hands, like tighter,
and strangle me, like bare tight,

06:14.280 --> 06:18.080
until I almost die but I don't...
I just do a big cum. You know?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.040
Fuck <i>50 Shades Of Grey</i>!
That's some vanilla shit!

06:21.120 --> 06:25.320
I'm talking raw BDSM.
Bondage, discipline, wanking, spanking...

06:25.400 --> 06:27.040
Oh, yeah. I feel uncomfortable so...

06:27.360 --> 06:28.240
-Trace?
-No.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
[scoffs]

06:33.680 --> 06:35.640
What are you doing? This is my room, sis.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.960
Thought you might want a shot
at taking the title.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.280
Oh.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.640
-Where's Mum?
-Evangelizing at the community hall.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.040
My dear, your vagina is holy.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.280
[Tracey's mom] I will command Satan
to leave your nether regions today.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.200
Fire, hallelujah, be gone.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.280
Apparently, there's a hedonism-inspired
plot for a party tonight.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.080
-Here on the estate.
-No, I think it's just Candice.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.000
The devil'll be prowling round her
flat like a lion on a low-carb diet,

07:03.080 --> 07:05.400
so probably better that we stay here
till tomorrow.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.080
-Yeah.
-Cynthia?

07:08.280 --> 07:10.360
-Mm?
-What do you want, uh, from life?

07:10.960 --> 07:11.840
Nothing.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.720
I mean nothing else, just this.

07:15.640 --> 07:18.400
No, come on, I mean,
like in 20 years' time, marriage,

07:18.480 --> 07:20.080
got kids, something, something else?

07:20.360 --> 07:23.120
I see... the three of us at the table

07:23.320 --> 07:26.280
like every other day,
except we're really old...

07:26.840 --> 07:28.760
Oh, and Mum... is, like...

07:29.600 --> 07:32.040
-really, really old.
-Oh, is she?

07:32.800 --> 07:35.360
There's a bunch of bloody tissues
near your bed,

07:35.840 --> 07:38.320
do you want my period pad?
I don't mind sharing.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.560
-[Ron moans] Oh!
-Jay-Z!

07:40.960 --> 07:42.360
I'm definitely going to bang Ronald.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.320
Tonight.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.520
[Candice] Ronald is going to bang you
before starters.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.920
Just remember all the shit I told you
and you'll be fine.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.400
[Tracey] I don't know why I lied
to myself, I want it, I want it.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.760
All right, I think I'm done.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.080
-I thought she was your friend?
-She is. Nan!

08:03.240 --> 08:05.120
[Tracey] OK, let me see, let me see,
let me see.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.480
I love it.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.080
-It's like Beyonce.
-Is it?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.120
My God, I'm nervous.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.440
Start with the right levels of eye contact
and the rest'll be easy.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.120
-Yeah.
-It's the difference between this...

08:27.240 --> 08:28.240
and this.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.160
-Wow!
-It's the come-to-bed face.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.280
-Right.
-Neutral face.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.520
[Candice] Come-to-bed face.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.920
Uh, OK, a little bit less.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.720
-I feel sick.
-OK, OK,

08:46.800 --> 08:48.960
um, you remember how to go in
for the kiss, yeah?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.960
No! No, Tracey.
Keep it light, keep it light, man!

08:52.120 --> 08:54.040
You've got to make him think
he's in control.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.800
-Yeah.
-And when he gives in to you,

08:55.880 --> 08:56.840
just sit on his face.

08:58.440 --> 08:59.760
-Uh, what?
-Just sit on his face.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.200
Just perch on it, love.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.400
Sit your bare pussy on his face.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.640
If he doesn't open his mouth,
just hold his nose.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.480
Like in the first aid.

09:08.400 --> 09:11.600
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Oh, Tracey!

09:11.760 --> 09:13.520
Come on, be confident.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.760
You're like fine wine.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.440
What's between your legs has been
fermenting there for 24 years!

09:20.520 --> 09:21.400
You're an asset.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.960
Oh, thank you, Esther,
that means a lot, you know.

09:24.040 --> 09:27.280
-I feel a bit... like Oprah.
-[Candice] Oh!

09:27.680 --> 09:28.600
[sighs]

09:28.680 --> 09:32.480
Candice, if you want Aaron to hurt you,
you just need to make him angry.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.800
-Oh, I don't know about--
-Have you tried laughing at him?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.880
Ronald always gets angry
when I laugh at him.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.640
-I'll think about it.
-Yeah, thanks for this.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.040
I love you!

09:41.120 --> 09:43.200
Look, I throb so hard
it's like my vagina's got epilepsy,

09:43.280 --> 09:45.720
-so I really appreciate this.
-[Candice's Grand mom] Go, go, go!

09:45.800 --> 09:48.720
And remember if all else fails,
get your tits out.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.200
-You good?
-Yeah... yeah.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.920
[elevator beeps]

10:28.880 --> 10:29.840
Where's your hat?

10:32.080 --> 10:34.640
It's, um, in my house.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.360
OK.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.720
OK.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.040
Oh, fuck, mate, you all right?
Your nose is bleeding.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.280
No, it's not, you idiot.

-[chopsticks fall on the ground]

11:41.240 --> 11:43.880
Look, I've to go to the toilet,

11:44.440 --> 11:48.200
but I'm scared you're going to try
and watch me walk as I leave...

11:49.200 --> 11:50.360
It's the least of your worries.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.240
Ron, you are terrible.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.640
I'm going.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.280
-Oh!
-[woman screams]

12:06.360 --> 12:09.280
-Sorry!
-What are you doing?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.320
[shushes]

12:10.400 --> 12:11.880
I like your...

12:12.320 --> 12:14.320
Um, can I get the bill? Thank you.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.640
Oh, shit, this feels good!

12:25.440 --> 12:26.880
-Pull it.
-What?

12:27.640 --> 12:28.560
Nothing.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.880
I love you, I'm not going to hurt you.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.480
Dig your nails into my bum.

-Nothing.

[Aaron moans]

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
Is something wrong?

12:44.480 --> 12:47.480
No, it's cute, babe,
you make sex moans like a girl.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.040
-[Candice laughs]
-What?

12:55.360 --> 12:57.440
You look different.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.400
I-- I had a makeover.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.800
-You're fine the way you are.
-Really?

13:06.280 --> 13:09.200
-How do you mean?
-Now you look worse.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.680
I think about you a lot, you know, Ron...

13:13.760 --> 13:17.360
sometimes I'm like, "Argh, what
can I do to get Ronald off my mind?"

13:17.440 --> 13:19.600
You could study,
you could get a qualification?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.760
-Yeah.
-Sign up for Bible study.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.360
Actually, you'd be better off enrolling
in Soldier of Christ Boot Camp.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.360
It's designed for people
who struggle with literacy.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.080
It's got your name all over it. [smirks]

13:31.640 --> 13:36.000
Ron, you're like a brick wall!

13:36.760 --> 13:38.400
If by brick, you mean impenetrable

13:38.480 --> 13:42.080
like Jesus, the epic superhero
of salvation, then, yeah.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.200
-[sighs] Where is that prayer guide?
-I don't know.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.920
The man who wrote it is doing
this amazing retreat.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.560
It's all about really listening to Jesus.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.680
It's a bit pricey, but they do have
discounts for, you know, the poor.

13:59.080 --> 13:59.960
Yeah...

14:03.680 --> 14:06.040
Oh, no, we're Christian.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.760
We're going to get married anyway,
so you might as well just show me now

14:08.840 --> 14:10.760
that you want me, OK?
Just rub your private parts

14:10.840 --> 14:12.520
on my private parts, OK,
nobody has to know.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
God won't even care, OK,
it's just a little thing, OK?

14:14.680 --> 14:16.920
I'm going to give you one tiny kiss,
if we can just have one little kiss.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.240
I'm coming towards you, OK,
I just want one kiss, OK, please.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.720
Ow, man!

14:22.760 --> 14:25.280
[crying] Sorry.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.280
This thing that you want, I don't want it,
I would never want to do that to you...

14:30.360 --> 14:33.560
Don't make me sound like no pedophile,
it's not disgusting, it's normal.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.520
What, it's normal to get a rope,
or a belt...

14:35.600 --> 14:39.000
Tie up, spank, whip, suffocate,
scratch, all of that shit, yeah...

14:39.360 --> 14:42.800
Aaron, what are you going apeshit for?
The violence is not without my consent.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.240
I don't think we're going to come
to an agreement on this, babe.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.440
<i>-</i>[girl] <i>Party, party!</i>
<i>-Candice, open up.</i>

14:49.760 --> 14:50.800
<i>Come on, man!</i>

14:51.240 --> 14:53.960
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, God, the party's started.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.560
[cries and blows nose]

14:56.240 --> 14:59.840
-What's happened to you? Who are you?
-I know it's bad.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.160
Yesterday you were normal,
but today you're Barbie.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.880
If Barbie rolled around in the mud
and turned into a Negro.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.200
Look, I know, OK, I'm just scared, Ron.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.840
We've been going out since I was 17
and we haven't done anything,

15:10.920 --> 15:11.920
I don't think it's normal.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.560
I haven't kissed you, I haven't held you,
I haven't sat on your face.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.320
Why would you sit on my face?

15:17.240 --> 15:18.480
I'm not sure.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.280
Mate! I can practically smell
the sin oozing out of you.

15:23.360 --> 15:24.840
Yeah, it's probably my perfume.

15:24.920 --> 15:27.200
There I was,
trying to raise you out of poverty.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.840
-Boy, was I wrong!
-Where you going?

15:30.080 --> 15:32.280
To have you arrested for sexual assault.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.920
No, no, no, it was Esther,
I didn't know that's what it was.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.360
To think I was actually going
to take you as a wife.

15:39.840 --> 15:44.040
Oh, for my foolishness,
God strike me down now!

15:44.120 --> 15:45.600
-[thud]
-[screams]

15:51.440 --> 15:54.200
Ron. Ron, are you OK? Can you hear me?

15:54.720 --> 15:58.160
[Ron breathes heavily]
What have you done? You're poison.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.400
Get your nasty hands away from me.
Stay away.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.400
OK.

16:07.480 --> 16:10.440
[Ron] Where are you going?
Get back here now!

16:10.880 --> 16:13.240
Yeah, can I have ambulance, please,
to Knowlson Street.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.800
-Go away!
-Yeah, near the police station.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.200
Someone got knocked down by a car.

16:16.280 --> 16:17.160
Come back.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.400
No, no, I thought I knew him,

16:19.480 --> 16:21.400
but he's definitely not
who I thought he was.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.640
[Ron] Get back here.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.040
Oh, yeah, he's definitely still alive.
Thanks.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.360
[laughing] Oh,oh, you're here.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.080
Right, listen...

16:32.040 --> 16:38.760
Man's soul is void, like the universe
got boyd, hold up, my hearts destroyed.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.000
-It's some heavy stuff.
-It's just rubbish.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.480
Ain't ready, ain't ready.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.240
[sighs]

17:17.160 --> 17:19.000
-[door opens]
-You're back where you belong.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.480
Let's grow old and play Ludo forever.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.120
-Let me breathe.
-Is it an asthma attack?

17:23.200 --> 17:24.880
Let's stay here and pray.
Where are you going?

17:24.960 --> 17:28.080
It's not safe out there,
the devil is prowling. It's Prowling!

17:40.680 --> 17:42.640
[indistinct chatter and cheering]

17:49.800 --> 17:52.960
You all right?
Cand said you were trying for the big one.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.720
I don't really want to talk.
Aaron, he threw me out.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.440
He was so disgusted by me
he threw me out the house.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.480
He fucking what...?

17:59.560 --> 18:02.520
Look, I know sexual harassment is illegal,
but it came from my heart.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.360
If he makes me feel like a freak
for expressing myself,

18:05.440 --> 18:07.400
or like what I want to do
is so wrong, then...

18:08.800 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, but obviously,
if it's like violent painful stuff...

18:11.080 --> 18:14.120
I don't care if I'm asking you to slap me
round the face, you should be happy.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.840
I express what I want,
and he goes apeshit?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.560
-He obviously don't love me.
-I do love her. 'Course I do.

18:19.160 --> 18:23.520
-With all my heart. I've... Oh, man.
-Where are you going?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.360
-What the fuck, man?
-What, I'm trying...

18:33.760 --> 18:36.240
I want to try anything that makes
you happy, man, why're you vexed?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.880
This is for when I'm wet, Aaron,
when I'm wet.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.200
Oh, right, I was just so geared up.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.040
Ah, baby, come in.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.800
Slow steps, yeah?
We'll start off with just a scratch.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.640
Yeah, I like that.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.400
Do you want to take it a little deeper?
In the bedroom?

18:57.800 --> 18:58.920
Come here, man.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.640
Please protect me as I step
into this flat, sublet by Satan.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.480
Give me the power to save Tracey
from his worshipers.

19:32.120 --> 19:32.960
Amen.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.280
Sorry, I thought it was empty, uh, sorry.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.760
I'm Connor. You look nice.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.080
Sit down if you want.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.520
[door closes]

19:55.240 --> 19:58.040
-You all right?
-Yeah, um, like, I don't know.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.280
My boyfriend broke up with me
and then he died,

20:01.360 --> 20:05.480
but I saw an ambulance on the way
so he's probably not dead. I just...

20:13.400 --> 20:15.080
-[books fall with a thud]
-[Tracey moans]

20:16.280 --> 20:17.360
[both moan]

20:17.760 --> 20:20.600
-Oh, my God! I'm going to take this off.
-OK, you're taking it off.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.280
-Oh, are you all right?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, no, it's fine.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.960
It's because I really like you.
I get nosebleeds.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.160
-[Connor] Ah!
-It's fine.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.800
-Yeah, yeah, get it off.
-Yeah?

20:30.040 --> 20:31.120
Yeah...

20:31.200 --> 20:32.440
Very good. OK.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.040
-OK.
-Oh!

20:34.520 --> 20:38.120
OK. Yes. More of that, please.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.280
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.920
-Shake them.
-[Connor] Ah!

20:41.000 --> 20:42.800
Oh, my God, that feels nice.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.360
-[Connor] Oh!
-[Tracey moans] So great!

21:03.080 --> 21:04.120
Oh, come on.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.520
Man's soul is a void, like the universe
got boyd.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.880
Yeah, got boyd. Got boyd!

21:09.400 --> 21:10.960
Oh, wait, wait.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.960
Oh!

21:15.920 --> 21:17.560
[Connor laughs]

21:18.800 --> 21:19.760
Oh, God!

21:20.280 --> 21:22.680
Ah, it's brilliant...!

21:23.320 --> 21:24.560
Oh!

21:24.640 --> 21:27.320
Sorry, I've just always wanted to do that.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.560
Yeah? Oh!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.800
[indistinct audio]

21:31.120 --> 21:34.000
OK. Almost there...

21:34.080 --> 21:34.960
Done!

21:35.560 --> 21:38.200
I don't remember if I was supposed
to wear clothes for this bit or not.

21:38.280 --> 21:41.000
Was it? No, it's too late.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.160
[Connor in a muffled voice]
What are you doing?

21:43.240 --> 21:47.680
-I don't know. I don't know.
-What?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.880
-Did you hear that?
-No...

22:06.800 --> 22:10.160
-Did you like that?
-Uh, no, not really.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
-Yeah, me neither. Yeah.
-Come here.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.160
My face is not to be sat on.
