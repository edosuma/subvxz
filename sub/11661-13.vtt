(mellow music playing)

01:04.633 --> 01:06.800
-Dorothy.
-Hi, Ma.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.266
Listen to this.

01:08.333 --> 01:12.233
"If I were truly free,
o fire of my loins..."

01:15.633 --> 01:19.734
"I'd take you to a paradise
where we could lie naked,

01:19.800 --> 01:24.834
bronze body against pearl body,
locked together in a frenzy of love."

01:26.500 --> 01:29.066
-Who wrote that?
-Merrill Kellogg.

01:29.133 --> 01:32.000
-Merrill Kellogg? Who's he?
-Ask Blanche. It's her letter.

01:35.967 --> 01:39.467
This is from that guy
in prison Blanche writes to.

01:39.533 --> 01:43.667
-How will you explain this opened letter?
-I'll take care of it.

01:44.567 --> 01:45.900
Good morning, girls.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.467
Good morning, Blanche.
Rose opened your letter.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.000
Blanche, I didn't.

01:53.066 --> 01:56.400
It's no problem.
It's just another letter from Merrill.

01:56.467 --> 01:59.133
I'd read it to you anyway.
They're not personal.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.567
Not personal?
He wants to lie naked with you on a beach.

02:04.633 --> 02:07.834
I wrote I want to make
passionate love to him

02:07.900 --> 02:11.000
in a hammock suspended
between two magnolia trees.

02:11.066 --> 02:13.033
You know that couldn't possibly happen.

02:14.266 --> 02:16.734
Well, maybe if you lose a few pounds.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.200
Shut up, Rose.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.700
These letters are just a fantasy.

02:26.767 --> 02:30.967
The man's in prison for the next 20 years
for armed robbery.

02:31.033 --> 02:35.066
-It's not right to lead the guy on.
-Why not?

02:35.133 --> 02:38.133
The man is surrounded
by concrete and bars.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.000
What's wrong with bringing joy
into his life?

02:41.066 --> 02:42.600
Nothing at all.

02:43.033 --> 02:46.934
Back in St. Olaf,
our justice system is very progressive.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.800
Their motto was "use a gun, go apologize."

02:53.867 --> 02:54.867
(doorbell rings)

02:54.934 --> 02:56.266
-I'll get it.
-I'll get it.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.900
-Mary!
-Hi, Dorothy.

03:03.967 --> 03:06.967
-Honey!
-Hey, welcome, stranger.

03:07.033 --> 03:10.233
-Come in here. Sit down.
-How have you been?

03:10.300 --> 03:13.567
-You having fun in high school?
-Oh, it's ok.

03:13.633 --> 03:16.867
High school.
It seems like only yesterday,

03:16.934 --> 03:20.433
riding around with the boys
and the dances.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.867
And don't forget the Hindenburg disaster.

03:26.033 --> 03:27.567
Ma, look who's here.

03:27.867 --> 03:31.500
Oh. So, Mary...
when's the baby due?

03:33.300 --> 03:39.033
-Ma, you're talking to a 16-year-old girl.
-A knocked-up 16-year-old girl.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.667
Ma, how did you know?

03:43.734 --> 03:46.800
You had the same panicked look
when you got pregnant.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.300
Like a deer caught
in the headlights of a car.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.033
I thought only pregnant teenagers
had that expression

03:57.100 --> 03:59.000
until I saw Dan Quayle on TV.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.533
It was only yesterday you were
selling us cookies.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.233
Now she's giving them away.

04:09.934 --> 04:12.333
Mary, honey, have you told your father?

04:12.600 --> 04:15.166
I tried, but since mom died,
I don't know.

04:15.233 --> 04:19.033
-We're on different wavelengths.
-What about the baby's father?

04:19.100 --> 04:21.700
After all, it's his responsibility, too.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.633
We broke up.
Besides, he's away at college.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.367
What will you do?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.934
I don't know.
My father kicked me out.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.333
I guess I got to get a job
and a place to stay.

04:33.400 --> 04:37.200
You have too many things to figure out.

04:37.567 --> 04:41.033
Stay with us until we decide what to do.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.934
-Really?
-We'll take care of you.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.900
-I don't know how to thank you.
-Come into the kitchen.

04:47.967 --> 04:50.233
I'll get you some pickles and ice cream.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.166
No, thanks.
I don't have strange cravings yet.

04:56.233 --> 04:57.367
Strange?

05:01.900 --> 05:04.667
I cannot believe
her father could be so mean.

05:04.734 --> 05:07.066
Not half as mean as his dog Samson.

05:07.133 --> 05:10.867
-You know what he did to Ida Silverman?
-No, what?

05:10.934 --> 05:11.934
He ate her.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.800
Gobbled her up without a trace,
support hose and all.

05:17.934 --> 05:21.166
Ida's daughter said she moved to Fort
Lauderdale.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.667
The woman's in denial.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.367
I saw that dog with Ida's scarf
in his mouth. Nobody's seen her since.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.233
What does Fred's dog
have to do with this?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.734
Dogs take on the personality traits
of their masters.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.934
That's ridiculous.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.300
Why does your brother Phil's poodle
like to wear that tutu

05:39.367 --> 05:41.367
and hop on his hind legs?

05:43.066 --> 05:47.166
Oh, come on, Ma. Phil would look
pretty stupid doing that by himself.

05:50.033 --> 05:55.266
(serene music playing)

05:56.000 --> 05:59.166
-Rose. Oh, Rose.
-Blanche, what's wrong?

05:59.233 --> 06:03.800
I never finished reading Merrill's letter.
Read that last paragraph.

06:03.867 --> 06:07.100
"My sentence has been overturned
on a technicality.

06:07.166 --> 06:12.500
I'm getting out on the 21st. Now finally
we can make our dreams come true."

06:15.667 --> 06:17.066
Isn't that terrible?

06:17.133 --> 06:20.400
He's written catchier stuff,
but I wouldn't call it terrible.

06:23.934 --> 06:27.467
I'm not asking for a literary critique,
you dweeb.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.367
Merrill gets out on the 21st.
That's tomorrow.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.433
-Then you can finally meet him.
-I don't want to meet him.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.300
I don't want him here. He's a convict.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.567
So Blanche's pen pal's getting out.
That's going to be rough.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.467
After 10 years in the jug,
he'll be short on foreplay.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.567
(knock on door)

06:57.633 --> 06:58.633
Come in.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.467
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.333
-I brought you an extra blanket.
-Thank you.

07:06.734 --> 07:08.500
Seems like old times, huh?

07:08.934 --> 07:11.433
Oh, I love this house. I love this room.

07:11.967 --> 07:13.400
I just feel so safe here.

07:14.433 --> 07:18.200
After I'd visit mom in the hospital
I was always so glad to come back here.

07:18.266 --> 07:19.967
Now here I am again.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.467
Only this time I'm pregnant.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.867
-It's funny, huh?
-What's that, honey?

07:25.934 --> 07:28.834
Just that I have another human being
inside of me

07:28.900 --> 07:30.467
and I've never felt more alone.

07:31.433 --> 07:33.567
Mary, that's why you have
to talk to your father.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.200
-No way.
-Listen.

07:35.734 --> 07:39.433
This is the most difficult thing
for a father to accept.

07:39.900 --> 07:43.000
-What, that I'm a grown woman?
-But you're not.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.967
Just because the plumbing's in doesn't
mean the house is ready to occupy.

07:49.433 --> 07:50.867
I think I know what you're getting at.

07:50.934 --> 07:53.433
Good, because I really didn't
make that up myself.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
I heard it on <i>This Old House.</i>

07:58.467 --> 08:02.700
Well, I tried talking to my father
but he went crazy when I told him.

08:02.767 --> 08:06.133
That's what fathers do.
They yell and they barbecue.

08:07.367 --> 08:09.567
That's what separates them from
the apes.

08:11.967 --> 08:14.467
Well, what did your father do when he
found out you were pregnant?

08:14.533 --> 08:17.867
He chased Stan for three blocks
with a salami.

08:19.500 --> 08:22.233
-How come?
-They don't leave marks.

08:24.033 --> 08:26.433
When he finally cooled down...

08:27.300 --> 08:30.567
he realized that he loved me
more than anything in the world.

08:30.633 --> 08:34.166
Which was lucky for me because I never
needed him more than I did then.

08:34.934 --> 08:37.467
I don't think that's going
to happen with my dad.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.300
Ah, you never know.
Fathers can surprise you sometimes.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.333
Dorothy, you remember when mom was sick,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.700
you used to stay with me
until I fell asleep?

08:48.734 --> 08:50.800
And I used to hold your hand...

08:52.967 --> 08:57.934
(calm music playing)

09:08.533 --> 09:10.100
Ma, what are you doing?

09:10.166 --> 09:12.967
Merrill's coming over.
I'm hiding valuables.

09:14.633 --> 09:15.934
Why?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.867
You think he went to prison
for free coveralls and male bonding?

09:20.900 --> 09:23.266
-(doorbell rings)
-Help me with the TV.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.333
Oh, Ma.

09:25.033 --> 09:28.100
I cannot believe Merrill
is a dangerous criminal.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.100
You've read his letters.
They're beautiful.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.800
They're poetic. They're almost lyrical.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.266
You can be sure he's a real gentleman.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.433
I want Blanche.

09:43.133 --> 09:46.433
Break out the finger sandwiches.
Mr. Astaire looks like he's hungry.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.834
-I'm Merrill. Are you Blanche?
-No.

09:52.033 --> 09:53.300
How about you, cutie?

09:55.633 --> 09:57.633
Boy, this guy's done hard time.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.333
No, Blanche isn't here,
and she won't be back for a long time.

10:06.734 --> 10:09.266
That's all right.
I've been in prison 10 years.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.166
I'm good at waiting.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Uh...

10:19.967 --> 10:23.000
-can I get you something?
-No.

10:24.533 --> 10:28.033
Those were lovely letters
that you wrote to Blanche, Merrill.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.800
I didn't write them.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.333
Walter, the guy in the next cell, did.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.133
He wrote them to Harley,
the night guard.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.467
He was hoping or a date for movie night.

10:43.533 --> 10:47.133
I copied the letters and changed "Harley"
to "Blanche."

10:48.367 --> 10:52.066
Well, you did make a small contribution,
Merrill.

10:52.834 --> 10:56.367
-Call me moose. That's my nickname.
-What a coincidence.

10:56.867 --> 10:59.834
That was Dorothy's nickname
in elementary school. Remember, Dorothy?

11:02.467 --> 11:03.633
No, I don't.

11:04.233 --> 11:05.233
Look, moose.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.333
-What?
-What?

11:11.333 --> 11:12.767
We don't know where Blanche is.

11:12.834 --> 11:18.900
She could be gone for hours. Days.
It could be weeks before she gets back.

11:19.433 --> 11:20.633
We're back.

11:22.300 --> 11:25.033
We found some terrific bargains.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.433
Mary, try something on
and show Dorothy and Sophia.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.467
Well, Dorothy,

11:31.533 --> 11:34.000
you didn't tell me
you were expecting company.

11:34.867 --> 11:38.533
-This is Merrill.
-Oh, well, how are you, Merrill?

11:39.233 --> 11:40.533
Merrill!

11:44.767 --> 11:47.934
Actually, he's more a friend of Blanche's.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.533
We were just explaining to Merrill

11:49.600 --> 11:53.266
there's no telling when
Blanche will be back.

11:53.333 --> 11:56.734
Oh, lord, no.
There's no use waiting.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.300
-You wouldn't like Blanche.
-She's not your type.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.934
-That's right.
-She's very cold.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.066
-Frigid. Hardly likes men at all.
-And she's ugly. Isn't she?

12:10.700 --> 12:12.834
Ugly is a pretty strong word, Rose.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.000
And wrinkled, isn't she?

12:18.400 --> 12:20.000
She is not wrinkled.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.567
-And fat.
-Stop that!

12:23.767 --> 12:26.467
She is none of those things,
Rose Nylund.

12:26.533 --> 12:29.367
She is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous,
gorgeous.

12:29.433 --> 12:33.800
All right. All right. Sounds good.
Tell Blanche I'll be back.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.400
And stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

12:41.867 --> 12:46.533
(mellow music playing)

12:46.600 --> 12:48.900
I'm off. I'll be checking in for messages.

12:48.967 --> 12:51.300
-Take care of the house.
-Where are you staying?

12:51.367 --> 12:53.433
With my friend Janet.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.934
She said I could spend the night anytime.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.467
Or was it her husband Ed who said that?

13:01.133 --> 13:02.667
I just had a thought.

13:02.734 --> 13:04.266
-Way to go.
-Congratulations.

13:06.266 --> 13:09.834
We should sign Mary up
for natural childbirth classes.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.033
That's not a bad idea.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.633
I wish I'd known about them
when I was pregnant,

13:14.700 --> 13:18.400
I didn't know what to do except scream
at Stan never to touch me again

13:18.467 --> 13:20.500
and call him every name in the book.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.033
-Rough labor?
-Rough conception.

13:32.533 --> 13:35.033
Oh, she doesn't need those classes.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.734
Women ought to have babies
the way God intended,

13:37.800 --> 13:40.200
strapped to a table,
numb from the neck down.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.333
Let me ask a question.

13:46.834 --> 13:50.000
So how much responsibility
are we taking on ourselves?

13:50.066 --> 13:54.734
Ma, what are you talking about?
We can't just abandon her.

13:54.800 --> 13:59.233
The girl needs a roof over her head,
guidance, emotional support.

13:59.800 --> 14:04.600
-It's up to her father, not us.
-I tried talking to him.

14:04.667 --> 14:09.200
He won't answer his phone calls
or the messages I leave in his mailbox.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.734
First he lets his dog eat Ida. Now this.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.633
-I'm mad as hell. Let's go over there.
-Ma, you shouldn't go.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.900
This is a sensitive situation.

14:19.967 --> 14:22.834
It's going to take a little patience
and understanding.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.066
All I have is a little patience
and understanding.

14:26.500 --> 14:30.900
All right, but listen, when we get there,
we're trying to make peace.

14:30.967 --> 14:33.834
So don't bring up Ida.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.400
I won't as long as the dog doesn't.

14:39.734 --> 14:43.233
(serene music playing)

14:44.033 --> 14:45.100
Hello, Fred.

14:45.166 --> 14:48.667
-Hello, Dorothy. Mrs. Petrillo.
-You haven't returned my calls.

14:48.734 --> 14:51.533
-There's nothing to discuss.
-We're not going away.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.667
All right. Come in.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.400
Have a seat.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.100
Uh...

15:16.367 --> 15:18.000
excuse me. Has he eaten?

15:21.066 --> 15:22.767
He won't hurt you.

15:22.834 --> 15:27.233
-I think I know how you feel about Mary.
-You don't.

15:27.300 --> 15:31.000
You feel because Mary got pregnant,
she's a slut.

15:32.066 --> 15:33.667
Let me tell you what a slut is...

15:33.967 --> 15:37.834
somebody who gets knocked up
in the back seat of a Studebaker.

15:38.433 --> 15:40.300
It was a Studebaker, wasn't it, Dorothy?

15:45.367 --> 15:47.100
It was a Nash, Ma.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.467
Now that's a slut.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.033
Doggy, I don't know if you noticed,
I'm skin and bones.

15:57.133 --> 15:59.066
Oh, I shouldn't say bones.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.834
-Now, where was I?
-You were humiliating me.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.734
Yeah, right. The slut.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.433
-Did I turn her out?
-You tried, Ma.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.000
But did she go? No.

16:11.266 --> 16:14.467
Look today. Nobody could
love a daughter more.

16:14.533 --> 16:17.467
-Thanks, Ma.
-So what if I don't respect her?

16:19.066 --> 16:22.200
You've got some nerve coming here.

16:22.533 --> 16:26.000
-You have no idea what I'm going through.
-(woof woof)

16:26.066 --> 16:27.533
I got to go.

16:28.133 --> 16:31.233
-Don't worry. The dog's just playing.
-Yeah. Right.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.300
What did you do with Ida?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.900
Samson.

16:38.433 --> 16:43.200
What ma was trying to say
is that you can't just throw Mary out.

16:43.266 --> 16:46.633
-I didn't. She walked out.
-Mary didn't say that.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.467
-We fought. Who remembers who said what?
-That's not the point.

16:51.033 --> 16:55.300
I remember how scared I felt
when I found out I was pregnant.

16:55.367 --> 16:59.467
My biggest fear was that my father
would hate me.

16:59.967 --> 17:02.834
God, was he angry, and was I scared.

17:03.367 --> 17:09.800
It was a long time before he'd accept it.
Fred, until he did, I only had one parent.

17:10.467 --> 17:13.066
Right now, Mary
doesn't have any parents.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.467
You talk like I did something wrong.

17:15.533 --> 17:18.700
What can I say that'll
make you understand?

17:18.767 --> 17:22.967
-Maybe I'm too stupid.
-Then maybe there is something I can say.

17:23.233 --> 17:25.934
I apologize for this story before I begin.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.734
Have you ever heard of a town
called St. Olaf?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.000
-No.
-Perfect.

17:33.300 --> 17:38.166
As it was told to me, and I admit
I wasn't listening that closely,

17:38.233 --> 17:44.467
there was this farmer named Nils Nieblung,
and he had a pig named Brunhilde.

17:44.533 --> 17:47.900
She won blue ribbons
at all the county fairs.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.667
Well, Nils also had
a daughter named Fricka,

17:50.734 --> 17:54.967
and she won red ribbons,
usually as runner-up to the pig.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.300
-What's the point?
-You asked that at just the right time.

18:00.367 --> 18:04.967
Anyway, one April,
Nils decided to breed Brunhilde,

18:05.033 --> 18:07.133
that's the pig, not the daughter...

18:07.800 --> 18:09.166
and he chose April

18:09.233 --> 18:12.900
because that's when pigs are at their most
beautiful and desirable.

18:13.433 --> 18:15.100
Unfortunately, so was Fricka.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.734
So while Brunhilde and the pig were
doing their thing,

18:19.800 --> 18:23.033
Fricka and the local pig breeder
were doing theirs.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.233
God, I hope I got the names right.

18:26.867 --> 18:29.700
Anyway, when Nils heard about it,

18:29.767 --> 18:33.934
he banished Fricka from his house
and his life forever.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.734
-So?
-So, after a while,

18:36.800 --> 18:40.800
he lost interest in the pig's company,
and he ate her.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.500
And he died St. Olaf's loneliest man.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.033
-Is that the end?
-God, I hope so.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.600
-I don't get it.
-Let me put it this way...

18:54.900 --> 19:01.333
she is 16, she's scared,
and she's carrying your grandchild.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.900
Do you really want to abandon her?

19:05.100 --> 19:10.233
(calm music playing)

19:16.500 --> 19:17.867
Anybody home?

19:23.867 --> 19:26.266
I thought you were spending the night
at Janet's.

19:26.333 --> 19:31.033
I got to thinking,
is there any reason to run from Merrill?

19:34.266 --> 19:37.600
The man's paid his debt to society,
hasn't he?

19:39.400 --> 19:42.467
Is there any man alive I can't handle?

19:46.033 --> 19:50.133
Well, I got nowhere with Fred,
and ma was no help.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.166
You can't control her mouth.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.266
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, good heavens!

19:56.333 --> 20:00.533
-Oh, Ma! Oh, what happened?
-Oh, what's the matter?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.467
-Who did this?
-The Sandinistas.

20:06.266 --> 20:09.300
-Why would they do this?
-Because I knew too much.

20:09.367 --> 20:12.066
-Merrill did this an hour ago.
-Merrill?

20:12.133 --> 20:15.300
Ma, what did Merrill do?

20:15.367 --> 20:18.967
He came for Blanche.
I couldn't hold out long.

20:19.033 --> 20:22.934
-How did he make you talk?
-I think it was the white wine.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.066
I said Blanche didn't want
anything to do with him.

20:28.133 --> 20:29.133
Then what?

20:29.200 --> 20:32.934
He wanted something to remember you by,
so he took the silver.

20:35.133 --> 20:39.233
I guess it's some consolation that he
couldn't possibly find the secret place

20:39.300 --> 20:41.500
-where I hide my jewelry.
-Oh.

20:42.433 --> 20:45.500
Did I mention there was wine and music?

20:46.533 --> 20:47.934
Ohh...

20:48.767 --> 20:54.200
(serene music playing)

20:57.166 --> 20:59.900
-(telephone rings)
-Hello.

21:00.967 --> 21:01.967
Merrill.

21:02.467 --> 21:03.667
My God, where are you?

21:05.066 --> 21:06.166
Jail?

21:06.233 --> 21:09.400
You're only allowed one call,
and you called me?

21:10.800 --> 21:11.834
What?

21:13.266 --> 21:16.066
I'm wearing a green silk pants suit.

21:18.367 --> 21:19.500
Underneath?

21:21.500 --> 21:23.633
-Well--
-Oh, give me that.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.300
(doorbell rings)

21:31.667 --> 21:33.133
-Fred!
-Hi,

21:33.200 --> 21:35.400
I thought I'd stop by since
I'm in the neighborhood.

21:35.467 --> 21:37.600
You live in the neighborhood.

21:37.667 --> 21:41.233
Right. I wanted
to come by and see, Mary.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.100
-Hi, daddy.
-How you doing?

21:44.567 --> 21:47.066
-I'm doing ok.
-Good.

21:47.467 --> 21:51.000
I've been talking to Dorothy,
and she really made sense.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.667
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.533
Why don't you come home,
and we'll work it out.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.133
That sounds good.

22:02.567 --> 22:06.433
-Thank you guys for everything.
-Don't you be a stranger.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.633
Don't worry.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.567
I'll come back tomorrow
and get all my stuff.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.567
Keep us posted.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.900
Remember, Tuesday
we have mime class.

22:19.433 --> 22:22.900
-Mime class?
-The Lamaze class was all filled up.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.100
Well, we'll see you soon.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.867
And, Dorothy, thanks for your help.
Maybe we can get together,

22:34.934 --> 22:37.266
and you can tell me
all about that St. Olaf.

22:38.934 --> 22:41.266
Sounds like a good place
to raise a daughter.

22:54.533 --> 22:56.033
I was desperate.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.266
(theme music playing)
