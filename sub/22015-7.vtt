WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.436
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.771 --> 00:05.373
sexually based offenses

00:05.406 --> 00:07.241
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.642
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.676 --> 00:10.311
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.344 --> 00:12.113
are members of an elite squad

00:12.146 --> 00:14.082
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.115 --> 00:16.284
These are their stories.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.454
- The cheetah is the fastest
animal on the planet.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.724
And it can eat up to 22 pounds
of meat in one sitting.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.126
- Like Billy.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.660
[laughter]
- Mrs. Drayson.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.129
- Stay with the class, Linda.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.131
- I don't think she's okay.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.133
- [crying]

00:32.166 --> 00:34.568
[dark music]

00:34.602 --> 00:37.138
*

00:37.171 --> 00:39.407
- Oh, my God.
Excuse me.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.609
Excuse me, I think
this woman needs some help.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.045
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:50.284 --> 00:51.519
- Her name is Laurel Linwood.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.421
A class of sixth graders
found her

00:53.454 --> 00:55.123
at the New York Natural History
Museum this morning.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.690
She was shaking.
She was crying.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.492
Security called 911,
they took her to St. Vincent's,

00:58.526 --> 01:00.161
and the hospital called us.
- Was she raped?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.662
- That's what she told
the doctor.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.298
They did a rape kit.
Tox screen was clean.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.135
And Lieutenant,
I got to warn you.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.736
She's in real bad shape.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.771
We couldn't get her
to say anything.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.840
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.509
Laurel, this is
Lieutenant Benson.

01:15.543 --> 01:19.613
- Okay, hey, Laurel.
Do you mind if I join you?

01:22.816 --> 01:25.319
Is it okay if I call
you Laurel?

01:32.693 --> 01:35.196
So the doctor who examined you

01:35.229 --> 01:38.532
thinks that--that you
may have been raped.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.738
That's okay.
So...

01:44.772 --> 01:47.241
We have plenty of time.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.143
We can talk whenever
you're ready.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.545
- What's the point?

01:53.714 --> 01:57.885
You'll never catch him.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.620
- What makes you say that?

01:59.653 --> 02:02.890
- Because I can't remember
a damn thing.

02:02.923 --> 02:06.160
[ominous music]

02:06.194 --> 02:11.465
*

02:12.833 --> 02:15.803
[dramatic music]

02:15.836 --> 02:23.244
*

02:59.813 --> 03:03.617
- Laurel, how did you get
to the museum?

03:05.819 --> 03:09.657
Did you meet him in the museum?

03:09.690 --> 03:12.526
That's okay.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.696
That's okay.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.798
So, yesterday,

03:17.831 --> 03:19.967
where did you go?

03:24.472 --> 03:30.444
- I went to the florist
on the corner.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.813
I didn't buy anything.

03:32.846 --> 03:36.417
I just like to smell
the flowers in the morning.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.987
- I can't think of a better way
to start your day.

03:45.993 --> 03:49.830
- Old Spice.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.699
He smelled like Old Spice.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.568
- The man who attacked you?
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.970
I know because my father...

03:57.004 --> 04:00.841
- Okay. Okay.

04:00.874 --> 04:05.313
So, Laurel, what else
do you remember?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.549
- I can remember the smell
of gardenias but I can't...

04:08.582 --> 04:12.019
I can't remember.
- That's perfectly okay.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.988
And if there's anything else
that you do remember

04:15.022 --> 04:21.395
even if you think that
it's bizarre or irrelevant.

04:21.429 --> 04:25.599
- [crying] You know--you know
what I remember when--

04:25.633 --> 04:28.436
When he...

04:28.469 --> 04:29.970
[sobbing]

04:30.003 --> 04:34.342
That stupid
National Geographic video.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.910
The antelope are running
across the plain,

04:36.944 --> 04:39.613
and then out of nowhere
a cheetah pounces

04:39.647 --> 04:44.885
and sinks his teeth
into their warm flesh.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.689
I was thinking
about the other antelope.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.758
The ones that got away.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.761
I mean, you think they'd learn,
right?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.863
But there they are the next day

04:55.896 --> 04:58.098
running happily
across the plain.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.700
- Hey, Laurel.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.637
This is a very common
first reaction,

05:03.671 --> 05:05.773
to blame yourself.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.575
But that's wrong.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.043
- Not to the cheetah it's not.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.645
I mean, who's really
in control?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.381
Who really has the power?

05:13.414 --> 05:14.682
You'll have to admit

05:14.715 --> 05:16.484
the antelope really
makes the cheetah

05:16.517 --> 05:19.387
work his ass off
for his dinner.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.424
[sighs]

05:23.457 --> 05:25.058
You think I'm silly.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.060
- No.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.929
No, I don't.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.964
I don't think you're silly

05:30.998 --> 05:36.570
at all, and nothing
you say is silly.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.639
What you experienced,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.742
this type of trauma, Laurel,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.911
plays games with your memory.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.979
It's like a puzzle.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.981
And you and me are gonna figure
out this puzzle together.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.152
We're gonna figure out
what happened.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.687
So.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.524
Right, you remember
the flower shop?

05:56.557 --> 06:01.595
And then what happened?
Where did you go?

06:01.629 --> 06:06.434
- I must have walked up
Madison.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.101
- To work?

06:08.135 --> 06:11.405
- I'm a personal trust manager
at the Commerce Bank.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.107
- Great. Do you walk
to work every day?

06:14.141 --> 06:18.412
- I could take the number four
train, but it's so crowded.

06:18.446 --> 06:23.717
Madison Avenue during rush hour
is just as bad.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.853
All the people.

06:25.886 --> 06:30.190
All the eyes.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.460
- What about them?

06:32.493 --> 06:34.462
- Oh, come on.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.664
You're a pretty woman.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.932
You know.

06:38.966 --> 06:42.603
Men stare at you.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.005
What do they expect?

06:45.038 --> 06:47.475
That you'll forget your plans.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.444
You'll forget you had
to go to work.

06:50.478 --> 06:54.014
You'll ditch everything.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.017
Everything on your schedule
and just lift up your skirts

06:57.050 --> 07:00.788
and do it on the sidewalk?

07:00.821 --> 07:04.024
- Well, if you stare
back at them

07:04.057 --> 07:06.860
they often--
they often look away.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.762
- And if they don't?
- Is that what happened

07:08.796 --> 07:10.063
to you yesterday, Laurel?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.099
Did somebody stop you
on the sidewalk?

07:12.132 --> 07:15.068
- No, I just--I don't know!
- It's okay.

07:15.102 --> 07:19.907
It's okay...
It's okay.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.778
- Laurel's like a role model,
you know?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.079
Really professional.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.781
Her clients love her.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.583
Is she okay?
- She could be better.

07:29.617 --> 07:30.984
- Oh.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.786
- Do you know
if she was dating anybody?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.522
- Uh, no one special
that I know of.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.056
- What about last night?
Did she have any plans?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.091
- I doubt it.
- Why's that?

07:38.125 --> 07:43.664
- Her dad died.
Yesterday was his funeral.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.232
- And is that him?

07:45.265 --> 07:48.902
- Oh, yeah, they took it last
summer in Sagaponack.

07:48.936 --> 07:52.039
That's her sister, Leah.
She's a lawyer.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.674
- You know where we can
find her?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.943
- At a firm in Midtown.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.711
[knocks on door]

07:57.745 --> 08:00.548
- Excuse me.
- Give me a sec.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.116
Thanks.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.925
Laurel.

08:11.959 --> 08:15.495
I'm so sorry about your father.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.601
- [breathing heavily]

08:20.634 --> 08:23.303
- Listen, after everything
that you've been through,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.706
it's completely normal.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.575
- [breathing heavily]

08:27.608 --> 08:30.878
- I'm so sorry.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.046
- My father had a lot
of friends.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.281
He saved a lot of lives.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.717
He was
a very important surgeon.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.251
[crying]

08:38.285 --> 08:41.254
- And you loved him very much.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.257
- It feels like there's
a hole inside of me.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.593
- Hm.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.728
- Is your father still...?
- Uh, no.

08:47.761 --> 08:51.732
No, he's not.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.301
- I-I guess I was expected
to speak at the funeral,

08:54.334 --> 08:56.236
but, you know,
it just didn't feel right.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.171
I mean,
my father knew I loved him.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.273
Why should I have to tell
all those people?

09:00.307 --> 09:03.343
Besides, Leah told everyone
how wonderful he was

09:03.376 --> 09:05.212
and how he took us
to ball games

09:05.245 --> 09:08.148
and he taught us how to swim.

09:08.181 --> 09:12.119
- And took you to the museum?

09:12.152 --> 09:14.221
- Every Sunday.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.090
That was our special time.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.159
While Leah went shopping
with Mother,

09:19.192 --> 09:21.729
we went to the West Side.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.096
And then we went to Bellini's.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.832
It's not there anymore.

09:24.865 --> 09:29.703
My father would order calamari,
and I would get...

09:29.737 --> 09:31.705
- What?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.874
What is it, Laurel?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.776
- Last night

09:35.809 --> 09:37.344
I remember

09:37.377 --> 09:40.247
that the calamari wasn't nearly
as good as Bellini's.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.249
There was too much breading.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.918
- Okay, so you went
to dinner last night.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.119
Do you remember where?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.888
- We were sitting at a bar.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.790
- With the man
who attacked you.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.026
- And there was a soccer game
playing on the TV.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.296
- Do you remember
what you drank?

09:56.329 --> 10:00.200
- Vodka probably.
That's what I always drink.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.269
- Okay.
- [laughing]

10:02.302 --> 10:03.771
Sounds terrible,
doesn't it?

10:03.804 --> 10:06.073
Like I'm some kind of drunk?

10:08.842 --> 10:11.144
[exhales deeply]

10:13.246 --> 10:15.282
- So, Laurel, can I ask you
a question?

10:15.315 --> 10:19.252
- Sure.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.990
- Has this ever happened
to you before?

10:23.023 --> 10:26.359
- You mean have I been raped?

10:26.393 --> 10:29.663
- Well...

10:29.697 --> 10:31.732
This cheetah, right?

10:31.765 --> 10:34.367
The cheetah
in the Nat Geo video.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.972
All the eyes on Madison Avenue.
They're all...

10:39.006 --> 10:41.809
They're all predators.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.845
- Don't you ever feel
like prey?

10:44.878 --> 10:47.280
- No. No, I don't.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.320
- You can wear a badge.

10:53.353 --> 10:57.457
And you can carry a gun,
Lieutenant.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.261
There will be a moment
when your guard is down.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.131
A moment of weakness.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.133
Big fish eat the little fish,

11:06.166 --> 11:10.037
and there's not a damn thing
we can do about it.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.105
[ominous music]

11:12.139 --> 11:14.875
*

11:14.908 --> 11:18.045
We're all prey.

11:26.386 --> 11:26.920
.

11:26.954 --> 11:27.755
- Is she okay?
- Well, she's confused.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.124
But it's to be expected,
okay?

11:31.158 --> 11:35.295
But it just--it might be better
if you waited to see her.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.197
- Well, shouldn't you
be out there

11:37.230 --> 11:39.066
looking for the bastard
who did it?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.168
- To tell you the truth,
we got nothing to go on.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.037
- Leah, why don't
you have a seat?

11:47.240 --> 11:49.442
- You should have seen
the spread that Leah put out.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.912
She certainly knows
how to throw a party.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.446
She was always
the more social one.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.817
I was known at school
as Leah Linwood's big sister,

11:56.850 --> 11:58.318
not the other way around.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.954
It was humiliating.
I guess she's just prettier.

12:00.988 --> 12:04.491
And she's smarter,
and toss of the dice.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.860
Scissors.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.796
- Scissors?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.063
- Yeah.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.800
- In your apartment?
- Uh-uh.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
- In his apartment?
- Uh-huh.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.805
I think it was in Chelsea.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.073
- Good, Laurel.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.409
Good.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.077
Okay, what else?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.780
What else do you remember
about his apartment?

12:26.814 --> 12:29.082
- It was dark.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.419
There was a breeze
blowing the curtain.

12:32.452 --> 12:37.324
The light from the street lamp
was shining in.

12:37.357 --> 12:41.128
While he was...

12:41.161 --> 12:44.965
I kept thinking, "If I could
just grab the scissors."

12:44.998 --> 12:48.869
- Okay.
- [breathing heavily]

12:52.505 --> 12:55.142
- Liv, you have a minute?

12:57.244 --> 12:59.346
- Hey, Lieutenant,
that's Leah Linwood.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.981
- Does she understand
the situation?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.415
- Yeah, and she's a lawyer.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.085
- Okay, so grab
Laurel's DMV photo

13:05.118 --> 13:07.120
and check out all
the bars in Chelsea

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
that had soccer playing
on the TV last night.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.123
- That's a lot of bars.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.092
- Yeah, so start
at 26th and 8th,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.928
and look extra hard at the ones
that serve calamari.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.098
- Got it.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.400
- So, Leah, this is
Lieutenant Benson.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.169
She's been speaking
with your sister.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.372
- I know you must be
very concerned, but, uh,

13:25.405 --> 13:28.341
Laurel is starting
to piece the story together.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.844
- Does she know who?
- I think she met a man

13:30.878 --> 13:35.182
at a bar last night and ended
up going home to his place.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.117
- She went home
with a complete stranger?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.220
- She was feeling very
vulnerable after the funeral.

13:40.253 --> 13:44.057
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.563
[distant sirens wailing]

13:50.597 --> 13:54.001
[indistinct chatter]

13:55.468 --> 13:57.971
- No calamari.
Excellent chicken wings.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.240
- Apparently
soccer's for girls.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.643
- We were walking
on 9th Avenue.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.613
He held my hand.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.281
And he pulled me in close.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.317
- The man you met in the bar?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.985
- Yeah.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.187
He said the bar was too noisy

14:14.221 --> 14:16.223
and we should
go someplace else

14:16.256 --> 14:18.025
where we could really talk.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.426
- Where? Do you remember
where it was?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.461
- Oh, it was probably
his apartment.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.031
- Okay, do you remember
where it was?

14:24.064 --> 14:28.101
A street sign?
Anything?

14:28.135 --> 14:32.372
- He was wearing
a Vacheron Constantin.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.943
That's my father's
favorite watch.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.011
[sobbing]

14:38.045 --> 14:41.548
He collected them.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.085
He said--he used to say

14:45.118 --> 14:48.956
"One day, Laurel...

14:48.989 --> 14:52.625
I'm gonna give this
to your oldest boy."

14:52.659 --> 14:55.929
[somber music]

14:55.963 --> 14:57.630
[crying]

14:57.664 --> 15:01.134
*

15:01.168 --> 15:04.204
- Yeah, she got here early.
Maybe around 7:30.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.206
Sat by herself,
staring at a vodka rocks.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.141
- Did she leave alone?
- I didn't finish.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.609
About 8:30, a guy joined her.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.412
- She was expecting him?
- Didn't look like it.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.214
Truth is, I thought
she was gonna blow him off,

15:14.247 --> 15:15.615
but he wore her down.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.250
- You know his name?
- Sorry.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.652
- And they left together?
- Arm-in-arm.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.655
They bought a box together
for Sunday's Jets/Bucs game.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.658
Take a look.

15:25.692 --> 15:29.096
- Here we go.
Laurel Linwood and Greg Harvey.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.998
- Thanks, man.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.466
[cell phone buzzing]

15:37.204 --> 15:40.007
- Okay, so, Laurel...

15:40.040 --> 15:44.277
Do you know a man
named Greg Harvey?

15:44.311 --> 15:48.281
- [sniffles]
Is that...?

15:48.315 --> 15:51.384
Do I have to look at him?
- Well, um,

15:51.418 --> 15:54.754
it would certainly help us
with the identification.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.090
- No!

16:00.727 --> 16:03.463
- I promise you
that it gets easier with time.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.232
- It's just...

16:05.265 --> 16:08.035
I thought you and I
were talking like friends.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.170
- We are friends.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.305
- Why do you do this?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.307
It's pity, right?
That's why you do it.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.775
You pity the pitiful.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.510
- You could not be more wrong.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.779
- [raising voice]
And you're not Jesus.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.182
You can't save me.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.251
You can't make it go away.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.687
No matter what you say,
the pain, the humiliation,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.456
it's never gonna go away.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.326
- Laurel, I have been
doing this a long time,

16:33.360 --> 16:39.066
and I'm pretty sure
that you feel alone.

16:39.099 --> 16:42.135
- I feel pure...

16:42.169 --> 16:46.773
and utter hatred.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.109
You can't know.

16:49.142 --> 16:53.380
- Laurel, I know
all about hate.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.115
- Really?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.717
Did someone force
your legs open?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.452
Did they lie
on top of you like

16:59.486 --> 17:01.221
you're nothing more
than a mattress

17:01.254 --> 17:03.290
and then force themselves
into you like a knife?

17:03.323 --> 17:06.626
Stabbing your soul over
and over and over again?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.629
Pity isn't going to bring my
soul back nor is false sympathy

17:09.662 --> 17:12.532
or whatever it is
you're doing right here.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.535
[tense music]

17:15.568 --> 17:22.609
*

17:24.577 --> 17:28.648
- But your soul's not dead,
Laurel.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.717
And I think

17:30.750 --> 17:35.222
that I'm here to help you
understand that.

17:38.291 --> 17:43.096
[whispering]
This I know.

17:43.130 --> 17:47.267
Your soul is not dead.

17:47.300 --> 17:54.474
*

18:11.324 --> 18:12.692
[knocking on door]

18:12.725 --> 18:17.130
- Greg Harvey, NYPD,
we have a warrant.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.133
[suspenseful music]

18:20.167 --> 18:27.340
*

18:35.482 --> 18:38.285
- Fin!

18:50.263 --> 18:50.563
,

18:50.597 --> 18:50.897
- Good news.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.932
Preliminary test results

18:52.965 --> 18:54.567
from the rape kit.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.336
Greg Harvey is the one
who had sex with Laurel.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.372
The bad news...the prints
from Laurel's coffee cup match

18:59.406 --> 19:04.244
a print found on the scissors
in Harvey's neck.

19:04.277 --> 19:07.314
- Does Harvey have a record?
- None. From what we can tell,

19:07.347 --> 19:08.848
he's an upstanding member
of the community.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.650
- We got to offer her a lawyer.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.453
- Well, she's got one sitting
right over there.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.688
- Okay, call Barba.

19:15.722 --> 19:19.692
And move Laurel
into Interrogation Two.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.939
- You should have called me.
- I didn't want you to worry.

19:32.972 --> 19:37.944
- They think you killed
the prick who raped you.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.279
- You lied to me.

19:39.312 --> 19:42.549
- No, Laurel,
we just found out.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.883
- All the sympathy
and understanding,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.685
it was just some
kind of trick.

19:45.718 --> 19:50.923
- No, your sister has agreed
to represent you.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.326
- [scoffs]

19:55.362 --> 19:58.298
- Please sit.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.474
Laurel, you talked...

20:07.507 --> 20:08.908
You talked
about the scissors.

20:08.941 --> 20:12.579
What room were they in?
- The living room.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.447
They were next to his watch.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.982
He had a Vacheron
just like Daddy.

20:16.015 --> 20:19.018
- She doesn't care.
- Yeah, actually, I do.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.787
Please continue.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.655
- That's why I stopped Greg
when he was kissing me.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.890
I thought about Daddy.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.725
I thought...what
would he think?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.594
I thought maybe
he was looking down thinking,

20:27.627 --> 20:28.961
"What kind of slut
did I raise?"

20:28.995 --> 20:30.963
- Jesus Christ.
Laurel, he's dead.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.832
He's not looking down
at anyone.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.867
And sleeping with someone
doesn't make you a slut.

20:34.901 --> 20:39.472
- [yelling] On the day
he was buried?

20:39.506 --> 20:40.907
- Okay, so, Laurel,

20:40.940 --> 20:45.645
what happened right
after you were attacked?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.614
- I stared at the ceiling.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.716
It was painted a blue-gray.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.751
It wasn't a very good job.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.020
Remember how mad Daddy
got at Mr. Tyler

20:54.053 --> 20:55.822
when he couldn't match
the paint in the pool house

20:55.855 --> 20:57.390
in Sagaponack?
- Please stop talking

20:57.424 --> 20:58.791
about Daddy.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.793
- Okay, so, Laurel,
when you were lying

21:00.827 --> 21:04.597
next to Greg and you were
staring up at the ceiling,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.333
did he...

21:06.366 --> 21:09.336
Did he try to touch you again?
- No.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.071
I don't...know.
- Laurel, don't be stupid.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.406
He must have.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.809
- Did he move toward you?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.011
Did he threaten you?
- I don't know.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.581
- Did he say anything?
- No.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.384
- Did you?
- What would I say?

21:24.417 --> 21:28.655
- Well, you told me that you
were filled with hate.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.624
- So did you!

21:31.658 --> 21:34.627
[tense music]

21:34.661 --> 21:40.900
*

21:40.933 --> 21:42.502
- You're right, I did.

21:42.535 --> 21:45.104
- It starts in your belly,
doesn't it?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.540
And then you feel
kind of nauseous.

21:47.574 --> 21:51.578
And then it starts bubbling
like that lava

21:51.611 --> 21:54.414
in that volcano in Hawaii.
- Laurel, stop talking.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.016
- [screaming] She knows
what I'm talking about!

21:57.049 --> 21:59.819
It bubbles and bubbles.

21:59.852 --> 22:06.092
Until it spreads down your legs
and your toes and your arms

22:06.125 --> 22:11.130
and your fingers.
Hatred, pure and simple.

22:11.163 --> 22:15.435
And it spreads until you have
to do something

22:15.468 --> 22:17.136
or it will eat you alive.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.073
- So what did you do?
- What did you do?

22:24.777 --> 22:28.981
- I beat him with a metal rod.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.418
- And did you kill him?

22:31.451 --> 22:33.720
- No.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.422
Did you kill Greg Harvey?

22:35.455 --> 22:37.123
- We're done.
- Did you kill him?

22:37.156 --> 22:39.492
- She's not going to answer
that question.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.529
- Tell me.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.930
- Christ, Laurel.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.532
- What difference
does it make?

22:45.565 --> 22:46.966
- Because
if he threatened you,

22:46.999 --> 22:48.568
it's self-defense.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.604
- I don't know.
I don't remember.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.440
- Okay.

22:53.473 --> 22:56.075
So let's go back
to what you do remember.

22:56.108 --> 23:00.480
You remember you were lying
in the bed.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.749
And you were looking up
at the blue paint

23:02.782 --> 23:04.183
on the ceiling.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.720
- Blue and gray.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.857
With streaks of white.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.760
And bubbles. And pocks.

23:13.793 --> 23:18.465
We did a better job
in the pool house.

23:18.498 --> 23:22.034
Mother and Daddy were
on the deck of the main house

23:22.068 --> 23:24.904
drinking martinis, remember?

23:24.937 --> 23:27.139
We thought we'd surprise them.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.175
And finish painting.
- You sound crazy, Laurel.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.544
- Hold on. Let her talk,
it helps her remember.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.646
- It's completely irrelevant
to what happened

23:33.680 --> 23:35.448
to her last night.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.751
As your attorney I'm advising--
- Just shut up!

23:38.785 --> 23:40.520
It was fun.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.489
What's so terrible
about remembering

23:42.522 --> 23:44.056
when things were fun?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.959
- Laurel, tell me about it.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.496
Tell me.
I want to hear.

23:49.529 --> 23:52.765
- I splattered your sweatshirt
with paint.

23:52.799 --> 23:56.469
The one Daddy brought you back
from his Harvard reunion.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.505
He brought me
a little mascot doll.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.974
You loved that sweatshirt,
but you got me back.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.944
You painted my nose,
and you painted my hair.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.079
I laughed so hard
I almost peed my pants.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.515
- It was a great time, Laurel.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.016
Can we get back
to the rape now?

24:10.049 --> 24:12.218
- And then Daddy came
into the room,

24:12.251 --> 24:13.953
and he was so mad

24:13.986 --> 24:15.955
because we got paint
all over the floor.

24:15.988 --> 24:21.661
Remember how red he turned
when he got angry?

24:21.694 --> 24:23.963
And he blamed me!

24:23.996 --> 24:28.501
As if it was all my fault.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.136
I should have known.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.172
I should have known not to go
back into that pool house.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.141
- Please, Laurel, don't.
Don't.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.176
- I tried the door,
but it was locked.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.245
- You're not helping yourself.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.980
You need to stop.
- Why would it be locked?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.582
- Now stop.
- Why would it be locked?

24:42.615 --> 24:44.116
- Shh.
- I know you and Daddy are

24:44.150 --> 24:46.586
in there
so I get the pool chair

24:46.619 --> 24:47.854
and I look in the window--

24:47.887 --> 24:51.624
- For God's sake, shut up!

24:51.658 --> 24:56.195
*

24:56.228 --> 24:58.998
- The look on Daddy's face.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.300
I'd never seen anything
like it.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.802
It was you.

25:02.835 --> 25:07.173
*

25:07.206 --> 25:10.242
- What's the point, Laurel?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.979
Why would you decide
to bring this up now?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.881
- Leah, you never told anyone.

25:14.914 --> 25:18.150
- Because there's nothing
to tell.

25:18.184 --> 25:22.689
It was decades ago, Laurel.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.224
We never even talked about it.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.928
Why would you tell a stranger?

25:28.961 --> 25:31.564
- Leah, I can refer you
to a therapist.

25:31.598 --> 25:34.166
- Oh, screw that.
I'm fine.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.268
She's the one
who needs therapy.

25:36.302 --> 25:40.306
And I don't need any of this!

25:40.339 --> 25:42.208
Just so you know,

25:42.241 --> 25:46.579
I am glad the old bastard's
dead.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.180
[door slams]

25:59.592 --> 25:59.759
.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.693
- Laurel, how come you didn't
tell your mother

26:02.194 --> 26:04.163
what you saw in the pool house?

26:04.196 --> 26:06.298
- I didn't want to upset her.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.001
- What he did to Leah
was wrong.

26:09.035 --> 26:13.105
- Then she should have
said something.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.042
- You know Greg...

26:16.075 --> 26:19.812
wore the same aftershave
as your father.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.849
And he wore the same watch.

26:22.882 --> 26:25.918
I think that when you used
those scissors

26:25.952 --> 26:27.954
you weren't stabbing Greg,
Laurel.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.790
I think you were stabbing
your father.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.258
[thunder rumbling]

26:32.291 --> 26:34.794
- I loved him.
- But you hated

26:34.827 --> 26:37.196
what he did to Leah.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.298
- He said it was a mistake.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.768
He said he'd never do it again.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.302
He didn't want me to be mad

26:43.335 --> 26:47.106
because I'm the one
he loved most anyway.

26:50.810 --> 26:53.780
[rain pouring against window]

26:53.813 --> 26:56.382
- He abused you too.

27:01.954 --> 27:05.424
How old were you
when it started?

27:05.457 --> 27:07.960
- It was fall.
I was six.

27:07.994 --> 27:12.098
Mother went
to Leah's ballet recital.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.400
We played cards.
I won.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.368
But I think he let me.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.238
Then he put me to bed.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.173
He thought I was beautiful.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.374
- And then what?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.376
- I put on my nightie.

27:24.410 --> 27:28.247
I asked him to turn away.
I was--I was so shy.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.184
He said, "There's nothing
to be ashamed of, sweetie."

27:32.218 --> 27:34.120
- How long did this go on?

27:34.153 --> 27:35.922
- Forever.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.058
We used to do it
in my room late at night.

27:39.091 --> 27:42.061
He'd get in my bed,
tell me how much he loved me.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.463
[thunder booming]

27:44.496 --> 27:48.100
- That's not love, Laurel.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.335
That's rape.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.904
- He said it was love.

27:56.275 --> 28:01.247
- And you never told Leah?

28:01.280 --> 28:04.751
- She must have known.

28:04.784 --> 28:08.120
She's not stupid.
You saw her.

28:08.154 --> 28:11.724
Don't you see?
I was in control.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.092
I knew what he wanted.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.328
I controlled every thought
in his head.

28:16.362 --> 28:20.432
Every muscle in his body.

28:20.466 --> 28:25.071
- Like the antelope
and the cheetah.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.174
- Me. Not Leah.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.443
Me.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.980
But you know.

28:34.013 --> 28:37.183
You know
what I'm talking about.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.919
You don't even know
when you're doing it, do you?

28:39.952 --> 28:41.788
- I'm sorry, doing what?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.189
- Every time I mentioned
your father

28:43.222 --> 28:44.290
you changed the subject.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.424
You tense up,

28:45.457 --> 28:46.926
and you change the subject.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.761
Tell me.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.196
- There's nothing to tell.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.198
- Tell me how you unbutton
that extra button

28:52.231 --> 28:54.433
of your blouse
when he was in the room.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.502
How you ran across
the living room

28:56.535 --> 29:01.908
in your panties when you knew
his eyes weren't on the TV.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.476
- Is that what you did, Laurel?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.012
- It's all in your head.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.947
It's all in bits and pieces.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.949
It comes out in different
places and different times.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.551
That's what you told me.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.954
And you said we were friends.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.122
- Yes.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.124
- And it's not because
we're talking.

29:18.157 --> 29:23.963
It's because our daddies
loved us more than our sisters.

29:23.996 --> 29:27.233
You and your daddy,
when was your first time?

29:27.266 --> 29:31.503
Were you wearing
a sweatshirt like I was?

29:31.537 --> 29:35.207
- And so, you have
this all wrong.

29:35.241 --> 29:38.978
Okay?

29:39.011 --> 29:42.348
I, um...

29:42.381 --> 29:44.350
I never even met my father.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.553
- We need to stop this.
- She knows what she's doing.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.521
- You poor thing.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.223
- No, I'm okay.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.492
- No, you're not.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.028
I can see your sadness.

29:56.062 --> 29:59.531
I mean, you have to wake up
every morning,

29:59.565 --> 30:01.533
you have to brush your teeth,

30:01.567 --> 30:04.904
and look at yourself
in the mirror,

30:04.937 --> 30:07.473
and then you see it
right there

30:07.506 --> 30:11.177
in your face and in your eyes.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.146
Something's missing.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.916
You don't feel a hole
because your father's dead.

30:16.949 --> 30:21.420
You feel it
because he was never there.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.455
He never loved you.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.024
[thunder booming]

30:25.057 --> 30:28.260
And late at night,
you close your eyes,

30:28.294 --> 30:30.963
but he's still there.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.299
And you hate him.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.534
But you love him too.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.071
And that's the absurdity
of your life.

30:39.105 --> 30:43.375
He's part of you
so you have to love him.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.377
- [softly] No, I don't.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.379
- Liv, we need to talk.
- Not now, Fin.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.582
- I think it's better if--
- I said not now.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.352
[tense music]

30:53.385 --> 30:55.421
*

30:55.454 --> 30:58.891
- He knows, doesn't he?

30:58.925 --> 31:02.361
- There's nothing to know.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.130
- Sure there is.

31:04.163 --> 31:08.067
You loved your daddy,
and he never loved you back.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.501
[intercom clicks off]

31:09.535 --> 31:11.403
[blinds shut]

31:14.706 --> 31:17.076
- He called me once.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.980
My mom picked up the phone,
but he hung up.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.382
And he never called back.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.986
But he kept newspaper clippings
of me,

31:27.019 --> 31:30.489
articles that he collected
in a box.

31:30.522 --> 31:35.127
So I was a picture

31:35.161 --> 31:39.398
of somebody he didn't know.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.568
You know, collection of
random facts and statistics,

31:42.601 --> 31:44.636
but--but I wasn't real.

31:44.670 --> 31:47.373
- Was he married?
- He was.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.509
He had a wife named Sharon.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.611
- And he loved her.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.213
More than he loved your mother.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.383
I'll bet he and Sharon
had kids.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.419
- Yeah, they had a boy.

32:00.452 --> 32:01.954
Boy named Simon.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.956
- And until your dying day,

32:03.990 --> 32:05.457
you will always wonder
why your father

32:05.491 --> 32:08.227
loved Simon
more than he loved you.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.162
And you'll try to think
of something else,

32:10.196 --> 32:13.299
but that question will always
be there nagging at you.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.534
"There's something horribly
wrong with me.

32:15.567 --> 32:20.406
Why didn't he choose me?"

32:20.439 --> 32:24.410
- He had everything.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.146
And he had no idea.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.015
- Simon?

32:29.048 --> 32:31.650
- Well, he had--
he had a mother.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.753
He had a father.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.756
And I...

32:37.789 --> 32:39.992
I had a drunk.

32:40.026 --> 32:43.329
[thunder rumbling]

32:43.362 --> 32:45.464
But...

32:45.497 --> 32:48.767
But it went to crap
for Simon as well.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.303
Because our father...

32:51.337 --> 32:55.407
Our father
committed suicide.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.377
- And you never got to tell him
you loved him.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.647
- I didn't.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.549
I hated him.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.585
- And he never got to tell you
that he loved you,

33:06.618 --> 33:08.320
and that's all you wanted.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.723
- You know
what the worst part is?

33:11.757 --> 33:16.062
The worst part is that...

33:16.095 --> 33:18.430
He never even looked for me.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.400
*

33:21.433 --> 33:26.438
But what the hell?
He was a scumbag rapist.

33:26.472 --> 33:31.510
He raped my mother.

33:31.543 --> 33:35.747
And I....

33:35.781 --> 33:39.051
I was just collateral damage.

33:39.085 --> 33:45.657
*

33:45.691 --> 33:48.494
[thunder rumbling]

33:54.633 --> 33:55.134
.

33:55.167 --> 33:55.401
- [sighs]

33:57.336 --> 34:00.139
- I think you're done, Liv.
- I can take over.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.740
- You couldn't get her
to say word one.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.176
- She's gotten as close as
she's gonna get to confessing.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.711
- Do you know what happened
in that apartment?

34:05.744 --> 34:07.846
'Cause I don't.

34:07.879 --> 34:12.218
- It's not worth it, Liv.
- Just another case.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.487
[door slams]

34:15.521 --> 34:17.323
- What would you say
to your dad if he was--

34:17.356 --> 34:19.325
- Definitely wasn't my "dad."

34:19.358 --> 34:21.360
- Okay, your father.
- Even that's a stretch.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.395
- What was his name?
- What difference does it make?

34:23.429 --> 34:25.164
- Well, I have to call him
something, don't I?

34:25.197 --> 34:26.565
"Scumbag rapist" doesn't really

34:26.598 --> 34:30.602
flow off the tongue.
- Joe. His name was Joe.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.305
- That's so sad.

34:33.339 --> 34:38.477
Nobody to buy you presents
just for the hell of it.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.412
- Like your dad

34:40.446 --> 34:42.814
brought you when he came back
from his college reunion.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.850
- Yeah.

34:44.883 --> 34:48.220
- He brought you
the mascot doll.

34:48.254 --> 34:51.190
And Leah got the sweatshirt.
That's...

34:51.223 --> 34:54.360
That's what you said
when Leah was here.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.229
But then you asked me if I was
wearing a sweatshirt like you

34:57.263 --> 35:00.766
were when--
- I made a mistake.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.169
- That's a pretty big mistake,
Laurel.

35:03.202 --> 35:08.840
You said that you spattered
paint on Leah's sweatshirt.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.510
Tell me about
that night again, the night

35:11.543 --> 35:14.313
when your mother took Leah
to the dance recital

35:14.346 --> 35:16.915
and you were home alone
with your father.

35:16.948 --> 35:22.421
- I already told you.
- So tell me again.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.791
- We had hot dogs.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.659
Daddy couldn't cook
to save his life

35:27.693 --> 35:29.661
so we ordered from the deli.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.430
- You said you played cards.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.465
- After we ate.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.903
- So when you
finished playing cards,

35:37.936 --> 35:39.405
what did you do?

35:39.438 --> 35:43.209
- I already told you.
- Tell me again.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.710
I got ready for bed.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.845
- And you put your nightie on.

35:46.878 --> 35:50.749
- It was pink
with white flowers.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.185
And I got into bed.

35:53.219 --> 35:55.954
And I waited for him
to tuck me in

35:55.987 --> 35:58.590
'cause that's
what he always did.

35:58.624 --> 36:03.229
Only this time he got
into bed with me.

36:03.262 --> 36:07.299
And we kissed.

36:07.333 --> 36:11.503
Not the way we normally kissed.
We kissed like grown-ups.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.943
- Like...

36:17.976 --> 36:20.746
Like lovers.
- Mm-hmm.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.448
- And then what?

36:22.481 --> 36:27.253
- And then he was
under the covers.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.589
When he took his pants off
so I didn't see it.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.592
And he said the pain
would go away.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.628
- Did it?

36:36.662 --> 36:38.330
- It was beautiful.

36:38.364 --> 36:43.702
- Were you scared?
- A little.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.337
- Just a little?

36:45.371 --> 36:48.374
- I wanted him to be happy.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.945
- Did you know it was wrong?

36:53.979 --> 36:56.782
- He did it with Leah.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.685
- You were six years old,
Laurel.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.354
The pain.

37:02.388 --> 37:07.459
How could anything
that hurt so much

37:07.493 --> 37:11.897
not feel wrong?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.566
- We made love.
- No, you did not.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.735
- We made love.
- No, you didn't.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.838
[softly] Stop.

37:19.871 --> 37:24.910
You got to stop.

37:24.943 --> 37:28.280
Laurel.

37:28.314 --> 37:32.518
I've been doing
this a long time.

37:32.551 --> 37:37.956
Women who are raped
and children who are abused

37:37.989 --> 37:42.761
don't say "we did this,
and we did that."

37:42.794 --> 37:46.532
They talk about what
their attacker did to them

37:46.565 --> 37:49.568
just like you did when you
told me about Greg Harvey.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.671
You said that he pushed
you onto the bed,

37:52.704 --> 37:55.607
that he shoved his tongue
into your mouth.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.909
- [exhales deeply]

37:57.943 --> 38:00.779
- Laurel.

38:00.812 --> 38:04.316
Is it possible...

38:04.350 --> 38:07.519
maybe that this is
in your head?

38:07.553 --> 38:10.088
That this is...
- No.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.524
- A fantasy?
- No.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.826
- And that it never happened?

38:14.860 --> 38:16.428
- No.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.731
- That all those times
at your beach house

38:19.765 --> 38:24.403
when you were unbuttoning
one more button on your blouse

38:24.436 --> 38:28.907
or walking around in your
panties in front of your father

38:28.940 --> 38:32.077
when he was watching TV...

38:32.110 --> 38:34.813
That was Leah.
Not you.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.848
- He loved me.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.418
- Not like he loved Leah.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.420
[whispering] You were jealous.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.590
Jealous of your sister.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.925
- I was just as pretty
and just as smart.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.827
- I'm sure that you were.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.129
But your father never noticed.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.366
*

38:54.400 --> 38:57.603
So he turned you
into that sad girl.

38:57.636 --> 39:04.075
And wondering
why he never chooses you.

39:04.109 --> 39:08.880
But Leah was the antelope

39:08.914 --> 39:12.684
that was caught by the cheetah.

39:12.718 --> 39:19.057
And you were just one
of the herd passing by.

39:19.090 --> 39:24.095
All those years
and he never picked you.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.498
- He loved me.

39:26.532 --> 39:29.167
He said I was beautiful--
- Like Greg Harvey

39:29.200 --> 39:31.036
said you were beautiful.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.606
He wore the same aftershave
as your father.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.776
He wore the same watch
as your father,

39:37.809 --> 39:40.078
but he wasn't your father.

39:40.111 --> 39:42.914
Your father was in a box
in the ground,

39:42.948 --> 39:46.418
and it wasn't fair.

39:46.452 --> 39:49.120
- Why wouldn't he pick me?

39:49.154 --> 39:52.591
- You're lucky, Laurel.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.192
You're lucky

39:54.225 --> 39:56.928
that he didn't pick you.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.730
When you're running
in Central Park,

39:58.764 --> 40:01.833
you ever notice kids
throwing a rock into the pond

40:01.867 --> 40:03.602
and it makes the ripples?

40:03.635 --> 40:07.673
They grow bigger
and bigger and bigger.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.041
Destroying everything
in its wake.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.777
That's what your father did.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.681
He threw an insidious rock

40:15.714 --> 40:18.216
into your family

40:18.249 --> 40:23.121
and it covered all of you.
You, Leah.

40:23.154 --> 40:26.191
- [quietly] Uh-uh.
[sniffling]

40:26.224 --> 40:30.028
- Your father was a monster.

40:30.061 --> 40:34.633
*

40:34.666 --> 40:37.836
And the three of you are
collateral damage.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.038
- Like you.

40:40.071 --> 40:43.509
- Yeah, like me.

40:43.542 --> 40:50.816
*

40:57.889 --> 41:00.892
- I'm going to prison.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.034
[breathes deeply]

41:09.067 --> 41:12.270
I waited until he was asleep,

41:12.303 --> 41:16.608
and then I stabbed him.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.680
- Damn.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.915
- Do it.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.858
- I just wanted him
to love me....

41:32.891 --> 41:35.293
Daddy.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.896
Why wouldn't he?

41:37.929 --> 41:41.199
[crying]

41:41.232 --> 41:44.235
- Come on.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.781
[tense drumming music]

41:55.814 --> 42:02.854
*

42:17.869 --> 42:18.003
.

42:18.036 --> 42:18.469
[dramatic music]

42:20.939 --> 42:27.979
*

42:47.132 --> 42:50.335
[wolf howls]
