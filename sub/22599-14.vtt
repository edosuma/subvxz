And you.

18:02.458 --> 18:05.794
Are you willing to face impossible odds
to save the woman you love?

18:06.420 --> 18:07.588
Of course.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.673
Good answer.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.676
Now, here's the plan.

18:12.676 --> 18:17.681
To move Earth's moon,
the Zeta-Beam will need a lot more power.

18:17.681 --> 18:20.642
I'll take an insulated cable
to the sea bottom...

18:20.642 --> 18:22.770
...and tap into the thermal
energy fissures...

18:23.395 --> 18:26.440
...to boost the Zeta-Cannon's power.

18:29.860 --> 18:33.697
This is folly.
Aquaman's plan cannot work.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.823
It's got to.

18:37.493 --> 18:40.704
AQUAMAN:
Strange, you need to buy us some time.

18:40.704 --> 18:45.542
Get into the Eye of Zared
and distract those scaly fiends.

18:45.918 --> 18:50.464
Oh, and rescue your lady
while you're at it.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.898
[GRUNTING]

19:36.510 --> 19:38.887
The power. The cannon, it's charging.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.889
It's reaching omega levels.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.891
We're tied into the very core of Rann.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.561
Good work, Aquaman.

19:52.901 --> 19:56.947
SARDATH:
Careful, Batman, 25 trillion miles.

19:57.573 --> 20:01.618
Even a tiny miscalculation could have
devastating effects to life on Earth.

20:42.451 --> 20:46.538
What? The entire ship has lost power.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.336
[GUNSHOTS]

20:57.591 --> 20:59.801
Enjoying the lunar eclipse, general?

21:00.427 --> 21:02.512
Rann has no moon.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.558
It does now.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.606
[ROARS]

21:20.697 --> 21:22.658
[SCREAMS]

21:47.599 --> 21:49.851
- The Gordanians?
- They surrendered.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.854
Without their doomsday weapon,
they've agreed to talks.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.815
And our moon's back where it belongs.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.692
Too bad.

21:56.692 --> 22:00.696
Looks like those two
could use a little moonlight.

22:07.786 --> 22:13.709
A fitting end to the strange encounter
of the reptile men.
