WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.969
What do you see, Mr. Paris?

00:04.070 --> 00:06.061
Shoes...

00:06.139 --> 00:07.629
muddy shoes.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.576
The dog.

00:11.644 --> 00:14.272
Good. That's exactly
what you should see.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:26.393 --> 00:28.361
But that isn't possible.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.328
l'm sure it's disorienting
to see yourself

00:30.397 --> 00:31.659
through another man's eyes.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.164
No, l...

00:35.502 --> 00:36.969
Tolen!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.198
Now l understand.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.739
l'd better be on my way.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.172
You don't have to go, Tom.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.368
He's got no right.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.638
No right?
This is my home!

00:45.712 --> 00:47.873
You come into my home
and steal my wife,

00:47.947 --> 00:49.278
and l have no right?!

00:49.349 --> 00:51.044
That's not the way it happened.

00:51.117 --> 00:52.744
This isn't the way it happened!

00:52.819 --> 00:54.343
The trial's over, Mr. Paris.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.389
There's no point
to further denials.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.855
l know about you, Paris.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.482
l know you were in prison.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.254
That has nothing to do with...

01:01.327 --> 01:03.454
We'll see what your Captain
has to say about this.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.929
When l'm finished with you,

01:04.998 --> 01:07.296
you'll never wear
that uniform again!

01:07.367 --> 01:08.459
l can't let you do that.

01:08.535 --> 01:11.163
No, Tom! Don't! Stop!

01:11.237 --> 01:12.704
No. l didn't...

01:14.941 --> 01:16.067
Tom, no!

01:29.155 --> 01:30.281
Let the record show

01:30.356 --> 01:32.449
that the sentence of the court
has been carried out.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.755
For the rest
of his natural life,

01:34.828 --> 01:38.161
once every 14 hours,
Thomas Eugene Paris

01:38.231 --> 01:41.564
will relive the last moments
of his victim's life.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.070
May the fates have
mercy on you, sir.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.694
lf the hydroxyproline level
is elevated this high,

03:51.764 --> 03:54.130
you'd probably call
for a pancreatic scan.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.168
That's exactly
what l'd call for.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.794
All right, then.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.134
Let's run through the
osteographic series again.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.731
Just enter the responses
you're sure about.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.447
So have you given any
more thought to a name?

04:10.516 --> 04:12.177
l asked the Captain for one.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.311
Why don't you
choose one yourself?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.149
Choose one myself?

04:16.221 --> 04:17.587
Me?

04:17.656 --> 04:20.319
Well, that just isn't...

04:20.392 --> 04:22.759
Holograms are programmed, Kes.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.694
They don't choose
anything for themselves.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.163
Why not?

04:26.232 --> 04:28.257
Because we're not capable
of choosing.

04:28.334 --> 04:32.771
Well, you choose
what medical treatment

04:32.839 --> 04:33.931
to give someone.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.802
l'm programmed

04:35.875 --> 04:38.810
with over five million
possible treatments,

04:38.878 --> 04:41.972
with contingency programs
and adaptive programs,

04:42.081 --> 04:45.209
but it's all programs
upon programs upon programs.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.753
There's no independent
decision-making.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.117
l don't see the difference.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.177
The difference is...

04:50.256 --> 04:51.188
l base decisions

04:51.257 --> 04:53.657
on information stored
inside my brain.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.091
How is that so different

04:55.161 --> 04:57.652
from the way you access
your programs?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.994
Well, if you put it that way...

05:00.033 --> 05:03.594
Do your programs have
any names in them?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.137
Certainly.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.365
l have the names
of Starfleet doctors,

05:07.440 --> 05:10.409
their patients...

05:10.476 --> 05:11.500
medical personnel

05:11.577 --> 05:13.909
in historical
and literary contexts...

05:14.013 --> 05:16.004
So pick a name.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.107
Just... pick one?

05:18.184 --> 05:19.446
Pick a name you like--

05:19.519 --> 05:21.749
perhaps from someone
who inspires you.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.521
Doctor... Dr. Galen.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.160
Dr. Salk. Doctor...

05:35.234 --> 05:36.758
Those are good.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.928
...Spock.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.632
Can you see yourself
with any of those names?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.943
Not exactly.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.638
Take your time.

05:46.713 --> 05:50.308
After all, you
will be that name

05:50.383 --> 05:51.714
for the rest of your life.

05:51.784 --> 05:55.777
Hmm. l never even considered
that l had a life.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.220
Janeway to Sick Bay.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.622
Activate emergency
medical holographic program.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.954
l'm already on, Captain.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.152
What can l do for you?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.321
We've got an incoming shuttle

06:03.396 --> 06:04.658
with an injured crewman
on board.

06:04.731 --> 06:05.857
Any details?

06:05.932 --> 06:10.699
lt's either Ensign Kim
or Lieutenant Paris.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.761
We haven't been able
to raise them.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.467
Sensors indicate damage
to various subsystems.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.009
You're sure there's only
one life sign aboard?

06:19.145 --> 06:20.772
That is confirmed, Captain.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.512
Transport him to Sick Bay.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.608
l'll be down there.

06:25.685 --> 06:26.652
Mr. Tuvok?

06:31.457 --> 06:33.584
They made me leave without him.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.058
He's severely dehydrated.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.289
No sleep.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.422
Neodextraline solution?

06:39.499 --> 06:40.830
Prepare an l.V.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.861
Can you tell us what happened
to Paris, Mr. Kim?

06:45.938 --> 06:48.236
They made me leave without him.

06:48.307 --> 06:53.142
They said he'd committed
a... a murder.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.108
Do you have any idea
who the victim was?

06:57.183 --> 07:00.311
An engineering physicist
we were working with.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.718
His name was Tolen Ren.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.723
The Banean Minister of Science

07:04.791 --> 07:07.760
introduced us to him
just after we'd arrived.

07:07.827 --> 07:12.594
So, from the other side
of the galaxy.

07:12.665 --> 07:15.759
70,000 light-years,
give or take a few.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.599
That's a long trip home
with a damaged collimator.

07:18.671 --> 07:21.435
lf anybody on this world can
help you, Professor Ren can.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.872
He's developed four generations

07:22.942 --> 07:25.035
of navigational arrays
for our ships.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.877
We have to stay one step ahead
of our neighbors, the Numiri.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.007
Did you bring your ship's
specifications with you?

07:31.083 --> 07:32.209
lt's all here.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.752
Splendid.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.685
Why don't we begin
to look it over

07:35.755 --> 07:37.120
at my home this evening?

07:37.190 --> 07:40.387
My wife would be delighted
to have company for supper.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.587
There was no reason to say no,

07:42.662 --> 07:44.926
but if we hadn't
gone with him that night,

07:44.997 --> 07:46.828
none of this would've happened.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.396
Oh, come on now, Neeka,
stop that racket.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.063
They're friends!

07:53.139 --> 07:56.506
That's better. That's better.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.012
What a good doggie.
What a good doggie.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.570
Oh, dearest?
Are you dressed?

08:02.648 --> 08:03.580
We have guests.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.946
l should have called.

08:05.017 --> 08:07.850
l just don't think
of the common courtesies.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.581
She's really wonderful

08:09.655 --> 08:12.818
about, uh, tolerating
my dreadful manners.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.291
So, you've done it to me again.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.123
Yes, dear.
l apologize.

08:16.195 --> 08:18.060
Lidell, this is
Ensign Harry Kim

08:18.130 --> 08:19.597
and Lieutenant Tom Paris.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.565
They're from the other
side of the galaxy.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.067
Hello.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.572
Nice to meet you.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.073
You might have called.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.472
You're absolutely right.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.272
Do you have enough
to feed us all

08:32.345 --> 08:33.369
or shall we go out?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.538
No, it's fine.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.741
l have some leftover
rolk from yesterday.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.443
l'll just throw it in the stew.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.816
Wonderful! Gentlemen,
make yourselves at home.

08:40.886 --> 08:42.285
l'm going to put on my slippers.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.913
Lidell will take
good care of you.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.819
Would you like a drink?

08:47.994 --> 08:48.983
Sure.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.595
Help yourself.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.241
What are you looking at?

09:07.313 --> 09:09.406
Not the same thing
that you're looking at,

09:09.482 --> 09:10.506
that's for sure.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.049
What are you looking at?

09:24.297 --> 09:27.095
lf it's spoiled,
Neeka wouldn't eat it.

09:31.604 --> 09:34.038
Nothing too fancy
or exotic around here.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.630
We're very simple folks.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.676
You're very kind to include us
at your supper table.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.540
We enjoy an occasional guest.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.477
l think Lidell would prefer us

09:41.547 --> 09:44.072
to entertain more often
than we do, yes?

09:44.150 --> 09:47.381
She's, uh, far more social
than l am.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.616
l'm afraid she gets
a little bored here sometimes.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.715
l'm so consumed with my work.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.352
And here we are bringing
more of it home

09:55.428 --> 09:58.920
to take your husband's attention
away for the evening.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.592
Whether you were here or not
makes no difference.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.794
Tolen would work anyway.

10:03.869 --> 10:04.801
l'm afraid she's right.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.464
We are at war, after all.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.169
By the way, how did you
get past the Numiri patrols?

10:11.243 --> 10:13.905
Lieutenant Paris
is our best pilot.

10:15.715 --> 10:18.809
Captain Janeway decided not
to take our ship into orbit.

10:18.884 --> 10:21.717
She wanted to avoid getting
involved in your conflict.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.984
So we came in on a shuttlecraft
that would avoid

10:25.091 --> 10:27.082
immediate detection
by the Numiri.

10:27.159 --> 10:28.683
l hid behind
the limb of the moon

10:28.761 --> 10:31.093
before l made a break
for your defense perimeter.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.994
By the time
their sensors picked us up,

10:33.065 --> 10:34.965
they didn't
have a chance to catch us.

10:35.034 --> 10:35.830
Well done!

10:36.702 --> 10:38.897
Finished already?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.738
The meat doesn't taste right.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.345
Well...

10:47.413 --> 10:50.576
we do have a lot of work
to get done.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.550
Perhaps we should begin.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.723
We went into the other room
and started to work

10:58.791 --> 11:01.453
on the navigational beam
specifications.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.324
lt was pretty dry stuff--

11:03.396 --> 11:06.957
you know, rewriting
baseline code algorithms.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.128
Tom got bored.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.694
He left us alone for a while.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.333
l guess he was with Mrs. Ren.

11:18.244 --> 11:20.678
l know they saw each other
again the next day.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.647
That was the night
Professor Ren was murdered.

11:23.716 --> 11:27.743
Did you talk to Lieutenant
Paris after he was detained?

11:27.820 --> 11:30.015
No, they never let me see him.

11:31.223 --> 11:35.319
They interrogated me
for almost two days straight.

11:35.394 --> 11:38.557
They asked me a lot
of questions about the Numiri.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.327
At first, they must have
thought we were Numiri agents

11:41.400 --> 11:43.163
or something.

11:43.235 --> 11:47.695
Professor Ren was the inventor
of Banean warship technology.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.240
He's completely exhausted.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.572
Can some of this wait until
he's had a chance to rest?

11:53.779 --> 11:56.009
We'll find out about Paris,
Mr. Kim.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.044
Janeway to Chakotay.

11:59.118 --> 11:59.982
Go ahead.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.145
Set a course for the Banean
homeworld, Commander.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.745
Aye, Captain.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.466
Come in.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.475
You sent for me, Captain?

12:31.684 --> 12:35.347
Lieutenant Paris has gotten
himself into trouble.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.323
l'm taking this ship into orbit
while we try to sort things out.

12:39.391 --> 12:44.192
Be prepared to be intercepted
by Numiri patrols.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.993
They always try
to intimidate travelers

12:47.099 --> 12:48.794
to the Banean planet.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.860
The stakes are too high to send
a shuttlecraft this time.

12:51.937 --> 12:52.995
l want to show our flag

12:53.139 --> 12:54.800
to make it clear
we mean business.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.205
l understand.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.210
Based on your experience,

12:59.278 --> 13:03.476
what can we expect the Numiri
to do to ''intimidate'' us?

13:03.549 --> 13:07.815
To be honest, whenever
l saw the Numiri coming,

13:07.887 --> 13:10.913
l always left before
the intimidation began.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.092
Before...

13:18.130 --> 13:22.328
Uh, however, uh, l know
from, uh, knowledgeable sources

13:22.401 --> 13:24.699
that they have
directed-energy weapons

13:24.770 --> 13:28.866
comparable to your own--
uh, our own, that is--

13:28.941 --> 13:31.569
plus regenerative shields
that may even give them

13:31.644 --> 13:34.272
a certain advantage over us
in a fire fight.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.110
Tell me about them, as a people.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.983
Are they aggressive, technical,
intellectual, emotional?

13:41.053 --> 13:42.953
Anything that might help me
deal with them.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.580
The Numiri and the Banea

13:44.657 --> 13:46.818
are quite different
from one another,

13:46.892 --> 13:49.554
even though they once coexisted
on the same planet.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.620
That's why l recommended
the Banea to you

13:52.698 --> 13:53.892
in the first place.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.662
The Numiri have
a remarkably covert society.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.532
Captain to the Bridge.

13:58.604 --> 13:59.571
On my way.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.734
We're scanning a Numiri
vessel approaching.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.869
They're at combat readiness,
Captain.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.571
Shields up.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.376
On screen.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.378
Mr. Neelix?

14:13.452 --> 14:16.421
A standard patrol vessel.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.716
Curious.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.281
Why?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.384
l would have expected them
to send out

14:22.461 --> 14:25.259
more than one tiny patrol
to meet a ship like this.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.925
Let's hope it's a positive sign.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.228
Hail them.

14:30.736 --> 14:32.226
They're responding.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.828
Open a channel.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.934
l am Captain Kathryn Janeway

14:38.077 --> 14:40.272
of the Federation Starship
Voyager.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.507
What is your business
in this system?

14:42.581 --> 14:45.345
One of my crewmen is being held
on the Banean planet.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.408
We're on our way to investigate.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.215
Consider this official notice

14:49.288 --> 14:51.518
that you are entering
a war zone.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.490
You do so at your own risk.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.527
Understood.

14:55.594 --> 14:59.257
Any attempt to provide
aid or supplies to the Banea

14:59.331 --> 15:02.494
will be considered an act of war
against the Numiri.

15:02.601 --> 15:04.125
You have my word that we intend

15:04.169 --> 15:05.864
to remain neutral
in your conflict.

15:05.938 --> 15:08.600
Our only interest
is in our own crewman.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.733
Proceed.

15:10.809 --> 15:13.744
Your activities
will be monitored.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.642
Very, very curious.

15:17.716 --> 15:22.676
ln Numiri terms, that greeting
was downright friendly.

15:26.058 --> 15:28.458
Have all security stations
remain at full alert.

15:28.527 --> 15:31.519
Continue long-range scans for
Numiri patrols around the clock.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.928
Aye, Captain.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.091
Take us into orbit.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.839
Captain, it's unfortunate

15:47.913 --> 15:49.972
we must meet
under these circumstances.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.415
My Chief of Security--
Lieutenant Tuvok.

15:52.484 --> 15:53.917
Please.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.422
Exactly what are these
circumstances, Minister?

15:57.489 --> 15:59.286
All we know is
that a member of our crew

15:59.358 --> 16:00.484
has been accused of murder.

16:00.592 --> 16:04.255
Oh, l'm afraid he's been
more than just accused.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.026
He's been convicted and punished
according to our law.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.869
What form of punishment?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.768
The perpetrator of a murder

16:13.839 --> 16:16.967
is forced to relive the crime
through his victim's eyes.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.907
How is this achieved?

16:19.011 --> 16:20.501
l can have
our Chief Medical Officer

16:20.579 --> 16:22.570
describe the procedure
in detail, if you wish.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.013
We have the capability

16:24.083 --> 16:26.677
of isolating memory engrams
in the brain.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.050
We take them
from the final moments of life.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.612
After they're used in the trial,
they're transplanted

16:31.690 --> 16:33.123
into the perpetrator's brain.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.125
These memories... are used
in the trial as evidence?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.397
An artificial life-form
serves as host to the engrams

16:44.470 --> 16:46.097
and testifies to their content.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.935
ln this case,
the victim's last memories

16:49.074 --> 16:52.510
clearly show Mr. Paris
caught in...

16:52.578 --> 16:55.411
an embarrassing episode
with Mrs. Ren.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.073
An argument ensues.

16:57.149 --> 17:01.677
Paris is then seen by the
victim's own eyes killing him.

17:01.754 --> 17:05.212
The evidence of his guilt
is incontrovertible.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.432
Captain.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.029
Are you all right, Tom?

17:21.106 --> 17:23.074
l've been better.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.733
May we speak to him alone?

17:24.810 --> 17:25.834
Of course.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.514
That rehab colony
back in New Zealand

17:33.585 --> 17:35.052
doesn't seem so bad right now.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.452
Lieutenant, did you murder
Professor Ren?

17:37.523 --> 17:38.683
No.

17:38.757 --> 17:40.725
But the victim's
own eyes identified...

17:40.793 --> 17:41.919
You don't have to tell me

17:41.994 --> 17:43.962
what the victim's own
eyes saw, Captain.

17:46.565 --> 17:51.025
l don't understand it either,
but l did not kill him.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.435
Were you having improper
relations with his wife?

17:54.907 --> 17:57.398
Their marriage was over.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.445
She told Ren they were finished
the same day he was killed.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.446
That does not answer
my question.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.676
Nothing happened between us.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.713
Almost nothing.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.453
Tom...

18:17.529 --> 18:22.023
it's very important
you tell us everything.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.037
Harry said you spent
some time with Mrs. Ren

18:26.105 --> 18:27.868
while he and the Professor
were working.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.575
l was bored.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.441
You know how it is when
two science guys get together.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.715
l came out of the other room,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.479
looked over
and saw her in the atrium.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.518
Her eyes were
a million kilometers away--

18:44.590 --> 18:48.117
staring at stars l'd just
flown by the day before.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.929
Smoking is a bad habit.

18:52.030 --> 18:53.691
My species gave it up
centuries ago

18:53.765 --> 18:56.461
when we finally got it into
our heads it was killing us.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.663
You must be
a very superior species.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.338
That's... not what l meant.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.433
Maybe l kill myself slowly

19:05.511 --> 19:08.776
because l don't have the courage
to do it quickly.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.346
Now, why would you go and
say a thing like that?

19:14.419 --> 19:15.852
-Don't.
-What?

19:15.921 --> 19:17.513
Don't get involved, Lieutenant.

19:17.589 --> 19:18.613
l was just trying to...

19:18.690 --> 19:20.555
You'll be sorry.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.754
Look, l was just bored to tears
in the other room,

19:23.829 --> 19:25.660
and l thought
you might like to talk.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.811
Why don't you go ahead
and ask me?

19:39.878 --> 19:42.438
Ask you what?

19:42.514 --> 19:45.210
What you've been wanting
to ask me all night...

19:45.284 --> 19:48.378
what they all want to ask me.

19:48.453 --> 19:53.481
Why l'd marry a man
old enough to be my father.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.689
l'd be lying if l said
l hadn't been wondering.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.196
He was good to me.

19:59.264 --> 20:03.325
A lot of other men weren't.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.734
That sounds like
a good enough reason to me.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.072
He's a good man.

20:09.141 --> 20:12.474
l would never do anything
to hurt him.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.479
l guess...

20:15.547 --> 20:19.108
that makes you a good woman.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.255
''Good'' can get very...

20:26.325 --> 20:27.883
boring.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.984
No, Tom! Don't.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.621
No. l...

20:32.698 --> 20:34.325
Stop! No!

20:34.399 --> 20:35.525
What's going on?

20:35.601 --> 20:37.626
No!
No!

20:37.703 --> 20:40.263
Apparently, he's entering
another cycle.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.547
ls this normal?

20:58.624 --> 21:02.424
We had some problems
integrating the Banean engrams

21:02.494 --> 21:04.428
into his alien neurology.

21:04.496 --> 21:07.056
This is the first time
he's lost consciousness

21:07.132 --> 21:08.121
since the implant.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.135
l'd like to take him
back with us

21:11.203 --> 21:12.500
to our medical facility.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.039
l'm sorry, but l
can't authorize that.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.735
Perhaps we should consider
her request, Minister.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.744
We don't want to risk
general synaptic failure.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.372
Their doctors might be
better suited to stabilize

21:23.448 --> 21:24.676
his condition.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.481
All right, but you're not
to leave orbit with him.

21:28.553 --> 21:31.283
Minister, we don't intend
to leave orbit

21:31.356 --> 21:33.415
until we prove his innocence.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.130
Away team to Voyager.
Three to beam up.

21:54.946 --> 21:57.039
lt's medicine
clearly beyond anything

21:57.149 --> 21:58.673
we've ever encountered before.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.479
What bothers me the most

22:00.552 --> 22:03.282
is the neural pathway damage
it seems to be causing.

22:03.355 --> 22:04.913
lt appears to be progressive.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.047
Then this punishment

22:06.124 --> 22:08.524
could actually be causing
serious brain damage.

22:08.593 --> 22:10.527
How long it might be
before he's seriously affected,

22:10.595 --> 22:12.495
l really have no idea.

22:12.564 --> 22:13.929
l would appreciate
receiving a copy

22:13.999 --> 22:16.024
of your neurological analysis,
Doctor.

22:16.101 --> 22:17.398
lt's extremely technical.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.165
To the layman, it would be
virtually indecipherable.

22:20.238 --> 22:23.605
Nevertheless, l will want
to examine it in detail.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.776
This might be the basis
for an appeal of the sentence,

22:27.846 --> 22:28.904
don't you think?

22:28.980 --> 22:30.208
Perhaps.

22:30.282 --> 22:33.718
However, before the neural
implants were developed,

22:33.785 --> 22:36.583
the Banean punishment for murder
was lethal injection.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.316
lt is possible
they would view that

22:38.390 --> 22:40.654
as the only alternative sentence
in this case.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.320
Will he regain consciousness?

22:43.395 --> 22:47.627
l believe so,
but each time the cycle repeats,

22:47.699 --> 22:50.896
l'm afraid his brain will
take another damaging blow.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.004
When he wakes up,

22:54.072 --> 22:56.302
l will require
an autonomic response analysis

22:56.375 --> 22:58.036
while l question him
again, Doctor.

22:58.143 --> 23:00.111
Do you really think
Tom would lie to us?

23:00.178 --> 23:01.475
As an investigator,

23:01.546 --> 23:04.447
l do not have the freedom
to ignore any possibility.

23:04.516 --> 23:07.451
Mr. Paris
maintains his innocence,

23:07.519 --> 23:10.852
yet the victim has identified
him from the grave,

23:10.922 --> 23:12.287
and the victim's wife

23:12.357 --> 23:14.917
has testified against him
at the trial.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.689
Someone is obviously lying.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.823
An ARA will tell us
if it is Mr. Paris.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.059
l'll have it ready for you.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.262
ln the meantime, Captain,

23:25.337 --> 23:27.430
l request permission
to return to the surface.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.371
What do you have in mind,
Tuvok?

23:29.441 --> 23:31.272
l would like to examine
the murder scene

23:31.343 --> 23:33.504
and speak with Mrs. Ren.

23:40.385 --> 23:41.716
Mrs. Ren?

23:41.787 --> 23:42.719
Yes?

23:42.788 --> 23:45.450
l'm Lieutenant Tuvok
of the Starship Voyager.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.617
Would you mind if l asked
you a few questions?

23:47.692 --> 23:49.785
Are you a friend of Tom's?

23:49.861 --> 23:51.852
l am the Starfleet
Chief of Security

23:51.930 --> 23:53.864
investigating
his alleged participation

23:53.932 --> 23:54.864
in your husband's murder.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.129
Stop it, Neeka.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.693
She just doesn't like strangers.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.204
Based on your testimony,

24:01.306 --> 24:03.774
l assume this is
where the murder occurred.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.107
Yes, right there.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.772
l had to have a professional
cleaning crew

24:08.847 --> 24:11.509
come in to remove
the bloodstain.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.914
You chose to remain in the house

24:12.984 --> 24:15.248
after an act
of such violence occurred?

24:15.320 --> 24:18.585
This has been my home
for over ten years, Mr. Tuvok.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.626
Do you really find that
so hard to believe?

24:21.693 --> 24:23.558
l am a Vulcan, Mrs. Ren.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.119
By nature, we are
a dispassionate people.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.827
lt is rare to encounter someone
as dispassionate as we are.

24:29.901 --> 24:32.392
Dispassionate?

24:32.471 --> 24:35.634
ls that how l seem to you?

24:35.707 --> 24:40.269
l think you'd get an argument
from Tom Paris.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.643
Can l get you a drink?

24:44.716 --> 24:46.980
Thank you, no.

24:47.085 --> 24:48.575
Mind if l have one?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.917
Please.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.684
You testified at the trial

24:52.757 --> 24:55.123
that you and your husband
had an argument the afternoon

24:55.193 --> 24:56.524
before he was killed.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.898
l never said there was
an argument, Lieutenant.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.760
Have you ever had
to end a marriage?

25:05.837 --> 25:07.031
No.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.198
Are you married?

25:11.276 --> 25:15.144
My wife and l have been married
for 67 years.

25:15.213 --> 25:18.740
l'm sure she's a fine,
dispassionate woman.

25:20.652 --> 25:23.587
l hope you never have
to find out for yourself,

25:23.655 --> 25:27.591
but l can tell you,
ending a marriage...

25:27.659 --> 25:29.718
it's a quiet thing.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.762
The arguments are long over

25:31.830 --> 25:35.527
and there's really nothing much
left to say at all.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.865
May l ask why you decided
at this time

25:38.937 --> 25:41.064
to end your marriage
to Professor Ren?

25:41.139 --> 25:43.664
Because l was attracted
to another man.

25:43.742 --> 25:47.473
l didn't want to deceive
my husband.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.481
That other man
was Lieutenant Paris?

25:51.950 --> 25:53.713
Lieutenant Paris would have been

25:53.785 --> 25:55.719
departing this planet
in a few days,

25:55.787 --> 25:59.655
and yet, you left your husband
of ten years for him.

25:59.724 --> 26:03.057
Meeting Tom
gave me the push l needed.

26:03.161 --> 26:07.621
l already knew in my heart
that it was time to start over.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.190
Exactly when did you
see Mr. Paris

26:09.267 --> 26:10.791
on the day of the murder?

26:10.869 --> 26:13.394
l went to see him
at the Engineering lnstitute

26:13.471 --> 26:15.234
after l talked with my husband.

26:15.307 --> 26:20.108
Once l was free, l knew
he wanted to be with me.

26:20.178 --> 26:21.372
How did you know?

26:22.847 --> 26:25.042
A woman knows, Lieutenant.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.483
He left his friend Harry

26:27.552 --> 26:29.417
to finish
the technical research

26:29.487 --> 26:30.511
and walked me home.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.682
We were caught in a cloudburst
on the way.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.920
Oh, l'm completely soaked.

26:36.027 --> 26:38.552
There must be a centimeter
of water in my boots.

26:38.630 --> 26:39.892
Here, let me help you.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.856
We shouldn't.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.417
lt's okay.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.053
He knows it's over.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.189
But you're still
a married woman.

27:14.265 --> 27:18.167
l haven't been married
for years, Tom.

27:18.236 --> 27:21.399
To him, l'm a friend,
a companion.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.102
He hasn't treated me
like a woman since...

27:25.176 --> 27:27.303
lt must have been
the day of the eclipse

27:27.379 --> 27:29.210
four years ago.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.508
Eclipse?

27:30.582 --> 27:32.914
He was very excited
by the eclipse.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.542
Don't ask me why.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.850
Our timing's just a little off.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.720
You'll be gone in a few days.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.522
This is the only time we've got.

27:50.902 --> 27:54.360
Let me make you something
to warm you up.

27:54.439 --> 27:58.569
l love to drink Marob root tea
on rainy afternoons.

28:02.547 --> 28:03.844
l made some tea.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.779
We talked for a while.

28:05.850 --> 28:10.617
Then we went out to the atrium
to watch the storm...

28:10.689 --> 28:12.486
and the rest you know.

28:12.557 --> 28:15.583
Did you leave the room
at any time during the fight

28:15.660 --> 28:17.525
between your husband
and Lieutenant Paris?

28:19.898 --> 28:23.265
l saw Tom murder
my husband, Mr. Tuvok.

28:23.334 --> 28:26.462
l tried to stop him.
l couldn't.

28:26.538 --> 28:27.869
Voyager to Tuvok.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.907
This is Lieutenant Tuvok.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.498
Mr. Paris has regained
consciousness.

28:31.576 --> 28:32.838
l thought you'd want to know.

28:32.911 --> 28:33.843
Thank you.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.345
l'll be returning shortly.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.778
Tuvok out.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.078
Thank you for your help,
Mrs. Ren.

28:42.954 --> 28:44.888
Lieutenant.

28:44.956 --> 28:47.584
When you see Tom...

28:47.659 --> 28:50.492
would you tell him that l...

28:50.562 --> 28:51.824
forgive him?

29:02.073 --> 29:05.702
Everything she told you
is true.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.302
Except l don't remember
going into the atrium

29:08.379 --> 29:10.006
or anything else after that.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.447
The last thing you remember is?

29:12.517 --> 29:15.315
Sitting with her,
drinking tea...

29:15.386 --> 29:18.378
talking about the sensual
effects of eclipses...

29:22.393 --> 29:25.294
After that l must have
fallen asleep.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.354
When l woke up, l was in a cell.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.726
He's telling you the truth.

29:33.471 --> 29:35.564
Was there any evidence
of a sedative in his system

29:35.640 --> 29:36.607
when he returned here?

29:36.674 --> 29:38.403
The Banean medical
authorities checked him.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.341
They didn't find
any drugs in his blood.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.311
Most narcotics would have
been gone from his system

29:42.380 --> 29:43.369
by the time he got to me.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.077
Chakotay to Tuvok.

29:47.152 --> 29:48.915
You're needed on the Bridge.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.011
We're under attack
by Numiri patrols.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.522
On my way, Commander.

29:59.063 --> 30:01.293
Evasive pattern Beta 140.

30:01.366 --> 30:02.924
Dual attack mode.

30:03.034 --> 30:05.229
Evasive pattern confirmed.

30:05.303 --> 30:07.203
They're attempting to lock
a tractor beam on us.

30:07.272 --> 30:09.240
That is a standard tactic
for the Numiri

30:09.307 --> 30:10.865
when they intend
to board your vessel.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.375
Well, at least now you know

30:12.443 --> 30:14.843
l was telling the truth
about them, Captain.

30:17.248 --> 30:20.081
Although l take no pleasure
in being right, mind you.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.140
But why now?

30:21.219 --> 30:22.516
Why an unprovoked attack?

30:22.587 --> 30:23.611
What are they after?

30:23.688 --> 30:26.418
The Numiri have never needed
an excuse to attack anyone.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.287
Shields at 90 percent
and holding.

30:30.361 --> 30:35.230
Commander, prepare to initiate
attack maneuver Kappa 010.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.824
Captain, if you don't mind...

30:36.901 --> 30:39.096
there's a Maquis trick
we sometimes use

30:39.170 --> 30:41.331
to get out
of situations like this.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.873
Be my guest.

30:43.908 --> 30:46.001
B'Elanna, remember
Teluridian lV?

30:46.110 --> 30:47.941
The two Starfleet runabouts?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.036
l'm with you.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.978
Blowing out
the dorsal phase emitters.

30:51.049 --> 30:52.038
Torres to Engineering.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.242
Go ahead.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.718
Vent a couple
of LN-2 exhaust conduits

30:55.787 --> 30:57.254
along the dorsal emitters.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.721
Make it look like
we're in serious trouble.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.553
Understood.

31:00.658 --> 31:02.455
Cut all engines.

31:02.493 --> 31:03.824
Engines off-line.

31:03.895 --> 31:06.921
Tuvok, lock phasers on
their navigational deflectors.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.659
Acknowledged.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.031
Numiri ships are closing.

31:11.102 --> 31:12.262
4,000 kilometers.

31:12.337 --> 31:15.898
Not to belittle Maquis tactics,
Commander, but this is

31:15.974 --> 31:17.271
a very old trick.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.776
lt worked against those
Starfleet runabouts.

31:19.844 --> 31:21.937
You're lucky l wasn't
commanding one of them.

31:22.080 --> 31:23.980
2,000 kilometers.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.346
Besides,
out here in the Delta Quadrant,

31:26.417 --> 31:27.975
every old trick is new again.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.213
1,500 kilometers.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.085
They're sending out
tractor beams again.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.555
That's our cue.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.451
Fire phasers.

31:36.527 --> 31:38.495
Engage impulse engines.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.365
Both Numiri vessels
are disabled, Captain.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.611
That's one trick you won't

31:56.681 --> 31:58.581
be able to use again
when we get back.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.277
l have more.

32:00.385 --> 32:01.682
Cancel Red Alert.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.152
Take us into high orbit.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.916
Captain.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.651
More Numiri will be coming.

32:07.725 --> 32:08.919
l promise you.

32:08.993 --> 32:13.054
Mr. Tuvok, any progress
with your investigation?

32:13.131 --> 32:15.691
Based on the ARA, l am convinced

32:15.767 --> 32:17.530
Lieutenant Paris
believes what he is saying.

32:17.602 --> 32:21.561
However, l can offer no tangible
evidence on his behalf.

32:21.639 --> 32:23.937
Considering the urgency
of the situation,

32:24.075 --> 32:26.509
l believe
the only logical alternative

32:26.577 --> 32:29.410
at this time
is to witness the crime myself.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.209
Yourself?

32:31.282 --> 32:34.274
l propose a mind-meld
with Lieutenant Paris.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.649
A-a what?

32:35.720 --> 32:36.652
What, what did he say?

32:36.721 --> 32:38.518
A mind what?

32:42.226 --> 32:43.784
Let me tell you something,
Lieutenant.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.158
Believe it or not,

32:45.229 --> 32:47.561
l know more about mind-melds
than you do.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.224
l know what every
Vulcan doctor has said

32:49.300 --> 32:51.530
in every study of mind-melds,
and l still cannot tell you

32:51.602 --> 32:53.160
what will happen if you do this.

32:53.237 --> 32:55.330
lf these cycles cause damage
to a human brain,

32:55.406 --> 32:57.772
there's no telling what the risk
might be to a Vulcan.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.969
l've examined your neurological
reports, Doctor,

33:00.078 --> 33:02.069
and l believe the risk
is acceptable.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.670
-Tuvok...
-Captain...

33:03.748 --> 33:05.443
the answers l seek
can only be found

33:05.516 --> 33:07.040
in the eyes of the murdered man.

33:07.118 --> 33:10.110
lt may be our only chance to
prove Lieutenant Paris innocent.

33:10.188 --> 33:11.951
Tom?

33:53.965 --> 33:55.091
Tolen!

33:55.166 --> 33:57.498
Now l understand.

33:57.568 --> 33:58.899
l'd better be on my way.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.869
You don't have to go, Tom.

34:04.976 --> 34:06.034
He's got no right.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.907
No right?
This is my home!

34:08.012 --> 34:10.572
You come into my home
and steal my wife,

34:10.648 --> 34:12.013
and l have no right?!

34:12.083 --> 34:13.846
That's not the way it happened.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.455
We'll see what your Captain
has to say about this.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.014
When l'm finished with you,

34:22.092 --> 34:24.083
you'll never wear
that uniform again.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.424
l can't let you do that.

34:25.496 --> 34:26.428
No, Tom, don't. Stop!

34:26.496 --> 34:27.464
No!

34:41.012 --> 34:43.071
The cycle's ended.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.349
No neural damage
that l can detect.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.755
Captain, l must consult
with Ensign Kim immediately.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.624
With Kim? Why?

34:57.695 --> 35:00.289
l assume he has access
to Professor Ren's research.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.855
l believe it will explain
not only why Lieutenant Paris

35:02.967 --> 35:05.595
has been accused of a murder
he did not commit,

35:05.670 --> 35:08.138
but also why the Numiri
chose to attack us.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.576
His condition has
continued to deteriorate.

35:16.647 --> 35:20.208
He'll have serious brain damage
if the implants are not removed.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.219
We are not a barbaric people,
Captain.

35:23.287 --> 35:25.687
This was meant as punishment
not torture.

35:25.756 --> 35:26.688
l see no alternative

35:26.757 --> 35:28.554
but to remove the implants,
do you?

35:28.626 --> 35:31.117
There is no legal precedent,
of course,

35:31.195 --> 35:33.493
but we can petition
the courts immediately.

35:33.564 --> 35:36.192
l cannot assure you'll find

35:36.267 --> 35:38.827
an alternative sentence
more to your liking.

35:38.903 --> 35:42.100
We're still committed to proving
his innocence, Minister.

35:42.173 --> 35:46.234
When do you intend
to return him to our custody?

35:46.310 --> 35:47.868
Due to the nature
of his condition,

35:47.945 --> 35:50.175
we're concerned
that our transporting device

35:50.248 --> 35:52.580
might cause
further medical complications.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.914
So we're sending him back
by shuttlecraft.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.420
They'll leave this ship
in one hour.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.423
l'll make the necessary
preparations.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.439
This is all your fault,
you know?

36:16.507 --> 36:17.701
My fault?

36:17.775 --> 36:20.573
Yeah, l consider you
the conscience l never had.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.580
You're supposed to keep me
on the straight and narrow.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.479
l tried to warn you.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.848
Funny, so did she.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.114
lf it had been me,
l would have stayed

36:30.188 --> 36:32.088
as far away
from her as possible.

36:32.156 --> 36:35.387
Someday it will be you, Harry.

36:35.459 --> 36:37.723
You'll meet her,

36:37.795 --> 36:41.026
and you'll know it's wrong from
the first moment you see her.

36:41.098 --> 36:43.999
And you'll know there's nothing
you can do about it.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.298
Here they come.

36:46.370 --> 36:50.636
Numiri patrol approaching,
bearing 067 mark 24.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.936
Red Alert.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.374
On screen.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.607
Range, 100,000 kilometers
and closing.

36:56.681 --> 36:58.740
They're changing course,
Captain.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.681
They're going straight
for the shuttle

37:00.785 --> 37:03.253
just as you said
they would, Lieutenant.

37:04.255 --> 37:05.381
Shuttle to Voyager.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.287
They've locked
a tractor beam on us.

37:07.358 --> 37:08.689
Offer no resistance, Harry.

37:08.759 --> 37:09.691
Acknowledged.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.853
Hey, Tuvok.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.396
l know
it's a little late to ask,

37:13.464 --> 37:16.627
but you're sure you've got the
logic of this thing worked out?

37:16.701 --> 37:19.795
lf l am incorrect,
we will know it shortly.

37:19.870 --> 37:22.464
Well, that makes me feel
a whole lot better.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.939
We're being boarded.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.776
He's the one.

37:43.794 --> 37:46.695
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway
of the Federation

37:46.764 --> 37:48.459
Starship Voyager.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.865
You have illegally seized
one of our shuttlecraft.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.496
l warned you that you were
entering a war zone

37:54.572 --> 37:56.199
at your own risk.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.366
Yes.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.068
We appreciated that warning

37:59.143 --> 38:01.043
and took
appropriate precautions.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.170
lf you read the sensor readouts

38:03.214 --> 38:05.239
in front of you,
you will see that the shuttle

38:05.316 --> 38:08.717
is carrying 40 tons
of thalmerite explosives--

38:08.786 --> 38:11.186
enough to destroy your ship.

38:11.255 --> 38:15.851
l'm prepared to detonate
those explosives in 30 seconds

38:15.960 --> 38:18.758
if you do not release
our vessel.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.195
End transmission.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.229
The shuttle's being released.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.240
The Numiri ship is withdrawing.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.333
Tractor the shuttle
and take us into low orbit.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.776
Cancel Red Alert.

38:34.845 --> 38:38.110
Mr. Paris, how soon
before your next cycle?

38:38.182 --> 38:39.911
Seven hours.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.282
That should be enough time
to clear this up.

38:42.353 --> 38:46.221
Mr. Tuvok,
this is your show now.

38:46.290 --> 38:47.757
With your permission,

38:47.825 --> 38:49.486
l would like to invite
all interested parties

38:49.560 --> 38:51.926
to meet at the scene
of the murder in two hours.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.487
l'll invite the Minister myself.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.268
Lieutenant Paris was not
the man Professor Ren saw

39:02.306 --> 39:03.500
before he was murdered.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.235
Not the man...

39:05.309 --> 39:08.005
But it was clearly
established at the trial.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.011
lt is true.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.342
Paris' image was seen

39:10.414 --> 39:12.348
in the memories
examined during the trial.

39:12.416 --> 39:13.508
However,

39:13.584 --> 39:15.449
that is because someone
altered the engrams

39:15.519 --> 39:17.282
from Professor Ren's brain.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.051
But that simply isn't possible
for this procedure.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.718
l would suggest, sir,
that there is no such thing

39:22.793 --> 39:25.728
as a technology that is
entirely safe from tampering.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.263
You're forgetting one thing.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.959
l was here and l saw him do it.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.365
On the contrary,

39:31.435 --> 39:33.665
l have not forgotten
your statement, Mrs. Ren.

39:33.738 --> 39:37.105
However, l now know
it is clearly false.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.905
Just what was in that tea
you gave me, Lidell?

39:40.978 --> 39:44.709
ls this just idle speculation,
or do you have some evidence?

39:44.782 --> 39:48.183
Mr. Paris, would you please
stand next to Mrs. Ren?

39:48.252 --> 39:49.446
What for?

39:49.520 --> 39:51.112
lf you wouldn't mind.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.625
The man Professor Ren
observed with his wife

39:58.696 --> 40:01.756
was virtually equal
in height to her.

40:01.832 --> 40:04.630
Clearly, Lieutenant Paris
is several centimeters taller.

40:04.702 --> 40:07.637
How do you know
what my husband saw?

40:07.705 --> 40:08.865
Vulcans have the ability

40:08.939 --> 40:12.102
to meld telepathically
with another's mind.

40:12.176 --> 40:13.837
l observed
your husband's memories

40:13.911 --> 40:15.378
as Lieutenant Paris
went through his cycle.

40:15.446 --> 40:18.711
l watched as the killer
stabbed Professor Ren

40:18.783 --> 40:21.513
right here,
through the intercostal space

40:21.585 --> 40:23.951
between the eighth
and ninth right ribs--

40:24.021 --> 40:26.717
the exact location
of the Banean heart.

40:26.791 --> 40:29.988
The killer clearly knew
Banean anatomy.

40:30.060 --> 40:32.358
Lieutenant Paris did not.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.957
Are we supposed to take
your word for all of this?

40:36.033 --> 40:38.126
There is additional evidence.

40:38.202 --> 40:41.171
For example,
we can now say for certain

40:41.238 --> 40:44.207
that Professor Ren
was murdered by a Numiri agent.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.242
What?

40:45.309 --> 40:46.333
Lieutenant,

40:46.410 --> 40:48.708
did you notice the stream
of symbols and numbers

40:48.779 --> 40:50.269
that were superimposed
on the images?

40:50.347 --> 40:52.042
Symbols?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.516
Well, yeah, l guess l did.

40:54.585 --> 40:55.711
l didn't know what they meant.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.481
l thought they were
part of the procedure.

40:57.555 --> 40:59.318
ln researching this procedure,

40:59.390 --> 41:01.620
l found no other reference
to this phenomenon.

41:01.725 --> 41:03.090
l have now confirmed

41:03.127 --> 41:05.561
that these symbols and numbers
were equations

41:05.629 --> 41:08.029
taken from Professor Ren's
weapons research.

41:08.098 --> 41:11.397
Someone intended them to be
delivered to the Numiri.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.300
You're saying somebody
used his brain

41:13.370 --> 41:15.634
to send secret data
to our enemy?

41:15.706 --> 41:17.230
He was a logical courier.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.776
The Numiri agents knew he could
leave the planet's surface

41:19.844 --> 41:21.311
without raising suspicion.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.905
The Numiri made two attempts
to gain access to Mr. Paris.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.610
They attacked just after
he returned to Voyager,

41:27.685 --> 41:29.619
and then again
when he was in the shuttle.

41:29.687 --> 41:32.212
Someone on the surface
had to be informing the Numiri

41:32.289 --> 41:33.916
of Lieutenant Paris' movements.

41:33.991 --> 41:35.891
Do you know who did this?

41:35.960 --> 41:39.396
You knew when Mr. Paris
would be in transit, Minister.

41:39.463 --> 41:41.431
But the doctor is the one

41:41.499 --> 41:43.990
who encouraged you
to release him to our custody.

41:44.068 --> 41:48.528
He is also the one who performed
the implant procedure.

41:48.606 --> 41:51.871
l know of no one else who had
the opportunity and knowledge

41:51.942 --> 41:53.273
to carry out this plan.

41:55.813 --> 41:58.782
l'm not going
to listen to any of this.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.909
l really would like you
to listen, Doctor.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.112
Would you please
stand again, Mrs. Ren.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.187
So we're the same height.

42:09.260 --> 42:10.852
lt proves nothing.

42:10.928 --> 42:12.225
l never saw this woman

42:12.296 --> 42:14.127
prior to the death
of her husband.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.530
l was never even
in this house before today.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.091
You forget the other witness
who was here

42:19.169 --> 42:20.932
on the night of the murder,
Doctor.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.133
Would you mind
asking her to come in?

42:41.492 --> 42:45.394
lt appears that you are
no stranger to Neeka, Doctor.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.861
He lied to me, Tom.

42:51.936 --> 42:54.336
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.806
You know l could never
do anything to hurt you.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.375
Yeah.

43:02.446 --> 43:03.743
You could.

43:29.907 --> 43:31.636
Tuvok.

43:31.709 --> 43:33.370
Mr. Paris.

43:34.712 --> 43:37.510
There are some who'd say
you risked my future

43:37.581 --> 43:40.607
on the eyewitness
identification of a dog.

43:40.684 --> 43:42.879
lt seemed a necessary step

43:42.953 --> 43:45.478
to ensure a truthful resolution.

43:45.556 --> 43:50.823
Well... l appreciate
you sticking up for me.

43:50.894 --> 43:52.953
l owe you one.

43:53.030 --> 43:56.261
l conducted
a criminal investigation.

43:56.333 --> 43:58.358
lf you had been guilty,
l assure you

43:58.435 --> 44:00.960
l would have pursued the truth
just as vigilantly.

44:01.071 --> 44:03.403
You have no debt to me,
Mr. Paris.

44:07.945 --> 44:10.106
How come l always see you
down here

44:10.180 --> 44:11.772
eating alone, Lieutenant?

44:11.849 --> 44:15.785
l prefer to read
rather than engage in...

44:15.853 --> 44:18.845
What do humans call it--
short talk?

44:18.922 --> 44:20.287
Close enough.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.422
You don't make
many friends that way.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.395
Perhaps.

44:29.299 --> 44:32.928
Well, like it or not,

44:33.003 --> 44:35.403
you've made one today,
Mr. Tuvok.
