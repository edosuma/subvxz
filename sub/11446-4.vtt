03:12.984 --> 03:14.691
He'll have you in two moves, Fraser.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.566
Who the devil?
I beg your pardon, Monsieur.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.063
Do not expose my game!

03:23.620 --> 03:24.701
How boring.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.699
The outcome is so terribly obvious...

03:26.790 --> 03:28.906
...that I do not see the point
of watching the rest.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.054
...self-contradiction.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.481
...perfume.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.022
How can I say...

40:38.353 --> 40:39.434
Help!

40:52.158 --> 40:53.193
Anyone!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.533
Brigands! Assassins! HELP

40:56.162 --> 40:57.197
Stay with the man.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.497
Be still, you English bitch!

41:12.679 --> 41:14.545
A virgin! I've got a virgin!

41:22.480 --> 41:25.097
How marvellous to see you...

41:25.191 --> 41:26.898
...and your charming Comtesse!

41:49.090 --> 41:50.125
Hold her!

41:52.343 --> 41:53.333
My God!

41:53.469 --> 41:54.504
It's La Dame Blanche!

42:03.271 --> 42:04.932
Run! It's La Dame Blanche!

42:05.189 --> 42:06.554
Come back, you fools!

42:09.610 --> 42:11.521
Run, save your soul!

47:28.012 --> 47:30.003
Come, dinner is served.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.189
Lady Broch Tuarach is being...

53:23.283 --> 53:24.364
...far too modest.

53:25.911 --> 53:28.369
That is actually a very particular stone.

53:29.248 --> 53:30.283
It is said to be magic...

53:31.875 --> 53:32.910
...ifone...

53:33.043 --> 53:34.750
...believes in such things.

53:35.754 --> 53:38.121
Indeed, it changes colour...

53:38.215 --> 53:39.705
...when poison is near.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.052
If the Lady is so worried...

53:49.143 --> 53:50.349
...about the cooking in her own home,

53:51.770 --> 53:53.932
perhaps we should all have a stone?

53:56.650 --> 53:58.482
Perhaps...
...you should.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.995
What is that?

54:26.263 --> 54:27.549
He's raping her!

54:31.935 --> 54:32.925
Let her go at once!

55:37.000 --> 55:38.206
Summon the gens d'armes.
