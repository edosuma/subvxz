00:02.045 --> 00:04.297
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.422 --> 00:05.465
Your APB's been lifted.

00:05.590 --> 00:07.175
You could go back to your old life,
if you want.

00:07.258 --> 00:10.011
I don't know.
It's pretty interesting here.

00:10.095 --> 00:12.514
I'll appoint a new head of the ATCU.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.557
<i>One who understands
they answer to you.</i>

00:14.641 --> 00:16.643
Oh, boy.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.314
We need to replace our losses.

00:23.441 --> 00:25.527
And our guest needs Inhumans.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.654
You wanna believe,
but you don't know if you can.

00:27.779 --> 00:31.074
You'll believe
once I make a believer out of him.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.112
Grant Ward.

01:11.156 --> 01:13.950
I wish we could have met
under different circumstances.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.493
He was a good soldier.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.662
He dedicated his life to HYDRA.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.166
Thank you for arranging that.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.337
He was strong, resilient.

01:26.838 --> 01:28.548
A perfect host.

01:30.508 --> 01:33.011
I made some moves this week

01:33.136 --> 01:36.222
to ensure we have all the Inhumans
we need when the time comes.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.224
In fact...

01:39.350 --> 01:41.519
I just acquired one
you might find useful.

01:41.853 --> 01:43.188
Bring him in.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.032
See if you can get through to him.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.207
I want to see his eyes.

02:43.081 --> 02:44.457
What are you?

02:45.583 --> 02:46.918
What are we?

02:52.757 --> 02:55.802
Don't leave like this, Carla.
It's not my fault.

02:56.928 --> 02:58.304
I just couldn't say no to the President.

02:58.429 --> 03:00.890
Yes, you could have.
You just didn't want to.

03:00.974 --> 03:02.725
You're always choosing
career over family, Glenn.

03:02.809 --> 03:04.018
That's not true.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.937
And now we're finally paying the price.

03:12.235 --> 03:13.653
I'm gonna fix this, Carla.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.670
Everything okay?

03:31.796 --> 03:33.673
What the hell are you doing here?

03:34.799 --> 03:36.384
Are you spying on me?

03:36.467 --> 03:39.137
You know, my personal life
is none of your damn business.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.263
You're right.

03:40.346 --> 03:43.224
But the ATCU is, which you now run.

03:43.308 --> 03:45.894
And since you refuse
to talk to me or return my calls,

03:45.977 --> 03:47.228
I didn't really have a choice.

03:47.312 --> 03:48.521
I've been busy.

03:48.646 --> 03:51.399
You know I'm technically
your boss now, right?

03:51.482 --> 03:53.568
But I'd prefer to be partners.

03:53.651 --> 03:57.363
You are not now,
nor will you ever be, my boss.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.199
And we will never be partners.

04:00.325 --> 04:03.453
I didn't ask to get put in front
of this sideshow circus.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.538
If I find out you had
anything to do with it...

04:05.663 --> 04:09.083
It was the President's idea,
as was the symposium in Taiwan

04:09.167 --> 04:10.877
that we're supposed
to be getting ready for.

04:11.002 --> 04:12.879
We need to be prepared.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.005
Somehow, I have the feeling

04:14.130 --> 04:16.716
your idea of being prepared
and my idea of being prepared

04:16.841 --> 04:18.968
are two wildly different things.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.105
Watch where you're aiming that!

04:31.189 --> 04:33.316
You're not seriously gonna
take that with you, are you?

04:33.399 --> 04:36.569
Best to be over prepared
than caught with your guns down.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.363
It's a diplomatic conference.

04:39.072 --> 04:42.909
Yeah. Throw Inhumans into the mix,
and you have to expect the unexpected.

04:43.034 --> 04:47.413
Speedy powers, melty powers,
eyeball death rays.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.582
Well, that's why we've got
Daisy and Lincoln with us.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.210
Oh, yeah. Good old Shake 'N Bake.

04:55.213 --> 04:57.006
What's in the case?

04:57.090 --> 04:59.217
It's the Director's new toy.
Something we've been working on.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.885
Does it kill, stun, or disintegrate?

05:01.844 --> 05:03.680
It makes gloves.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.146
Hey, Fitz.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.439
Are you coming with us?

05:13.564 --> 05:14.565
My work's done.

05:14.691 --> 05:17.068
I'm just gonna put this
in the Director's cabin.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.862
So, what do you know
about this conference?

05:19.946 --> 05:22.365
I know it's small, secret,
just a few countries.

05:22.448 --> 05:26.285
They're calling it
"a symposium on the alien contagion."

05:26.411 --> 05:29.372
No wonder everyone is afraid of us
when they use words like that.

05:29.455 --> 05:30.957
And you know, we're only part alien.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.918
And it's not a disease,
it's an awakening.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.378
Interesting word choice.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.463
I mean, for me.

05:37.588 --> 05:41.384
Terrigenesis made me
who I was supposed to be.

05:41.467 --> 05:45.179
I was given a gift, and I use it to stop
bad people from doing bad things.

05:45.263 --> 05:48.516
Unfortunately, some of those
bad people are also Inhumans.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.309
Yeah, well, you know who else
does bad things?

05:50.435 --> 05:54.647
Humans, but you don't see any
symposiums on the human contagion.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.773
Humans, we know.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.026
Inhumans are brand-new territory.

05:58.109 --> 06:00.737
People fear what they don't understand.

06:01.154 --> 06:02.780
Any word from Lincoln?

06:02.905 --> 06:05.491
How's his field op with May going?

06:05.616 --> 06:07.618
Just a trial run.

06:07.744 --> 06:10.455
But having been there myself, I'd say...

06:11.956 --> 06:12.999
He's miserable.

06:13.124 --> 06:14.333
<i>You're too obvious. Blend in.</i>

06:14.459 --> 06:18.046
I've been blending in half my life.
Pretty sure I can handle this.

06:18.129 --> 06:19.172
Where are you?

06:19.297 --> 06:21.883
<i>Watching your every move.</i>

06:21.966 --> 06:23.593
Stay focused.

06:23.676 --> 06:26.137
Field work isn't always about rushing in
and using your powers.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.097
Look for anything out of the ordinary.

06:28.181 --> 06:30.266
People with their hands in their pockets,

06:30.349 --> 06:31.392
<i>long coats,</i>

06:31.476 --> 06:33.394
<i>clothes that don't match the weather.</i>

06:33.478 --> 06:35.313
Wait.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.273
I think I see something suspicious.

06:37.857 --> 06:39.108
<i>What is it? What do you see?</i>

06:39.192 --> 06:41.944
No one would ever intentionally
cut their hair like that.

06:42.028 --> 06:43.696
Not funny.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.281
We're here to protect the Director.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.657
Try and remember that.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.787
This symposium is gonna be
a colossal waste of time.

06:50.870 --> 06:53.122
Sitting around a conference table,
singing <i>Kumbaya</i>

06:53.206 --> 06:55.083
is not going to accomplish
a damn thing.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.501
I'm less interested in the symposium

06:56.626 --> 06:58.669
than I am with the intel
we can gather there.

06:58.795 --> 07:01.464
We need to know if any of these
countries are harbouring Inhumans.

07:01.547 --> 07:03.382
So it's a sneaky little spy mission.

07:03.508 --> 07:06.677
S.H.I.E.L.D., remember?
That's how we roll.

07:08.971 --> 07:12.683
May, I've got one. No joke.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.688
My gut tells me Malick
will have a presence there.

07:17.814 --> 07:20.817
Someone in his pocket
trying to influence the delegates

07:20.900 --> 07:22.693
while getting information
on any Inhumans.

07:22.819 --> 07:23.903
Sounds like you.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.029
Yeah.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.032
But we're the good guys.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.201
I know it's none of my business,

07:30.993 --> 07:33.454
but I hope you and Carla
work things out for your son.

07:33.538 --> 07:34.997
George, right?

07:35.081 --> 07:36.999
What is he, 11 now?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.417
He's 12.

07:38.543 --> 07:40.169
- A good age.
- Yeah.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.337
Good night, General.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.005
Director.

07:43.089 --> 07:45.550
<i>Coulson, 12 o'clock.
Get out of there, now!</i>

07:48.845 --> 07:49.846
Creel.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.597
- Get in.
- Hey!

07:51.722 --> 07:53.558
Coulson!

07:53.683 --> 07:55.977
May, they got Carl Creel.
I need backup.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.479
Lincoln, forget what I said.
Rush in and use your powers.

07:58.563 --> 07:59.605
<i>I'm on it.</i>

08:31.095 --> 08:32.763
Hey, Michelin Man.

08:32.889 --> 08:34.890
Let's finish this.

08:42.106 --> 08:43.149
Lincoln!

08:49.947 --> 08:51.782
Lincoln, enough!

08:52.617 --> 08:53.826
Stand down.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.912
That's an order!

09:02.835 --> 09:05.004
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

09:05.129 --> 09:06.130
It's Creel.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.757
He was trying to assassinate you.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.592
Assassinate me?

09:10.468 --> 09:12.345
He's here to protect me.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.563
His absorbing powers
don't seem so impressive now,

09:22.647 --> 09:24.982
not with all the Inhumans around.

09:26.150 --> 09:28.736
Mr Creel,
I'd like to ask you a few questions,

09:28.819 --> 09:30.696
if you don't mind.

09:32.323 --> 09:34.325
Do you know how you got your powers?

09:34.450 --> 09:35.618
An experiment.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.203
Something went wrong.

09:39.288 --> 09:40.998
Something went right.

09:41.624 --> 09:44.961
You're the only human who survived
contact with a Terrigen Obelisk.

09:45.044 --> 09:46.504
What was that like?

09:47.338 --> 09:48.631
It hurt.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.549
Well, by all accounts,
you should be dead.

09:50.675 --> 09:52.426
Only Inhumans
can touch them and survive.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.136
Do you know how that was possible?

09:54.220 --> 09:55.304
Beats me.

09:59.392 --> 10:00.851
I still have a sample of his DNA.

10:00.977 --> 10:02.937
Yeah, perhaps
we should reopen our study,

10:03.020 --> 10:04.772
now we know more about the Inhumans.

10:04.855 --> 10:06.857
Do you know how long
we'll be keeping him here?

10:06.983 --> 10:08.025
I don't know.

10:08.109 --> 10:10.194
There's still a lot of bad blood.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.617
He killed my friends, Izzy and Idaho.

10:16.701 --> 10:18.119
I watched them die.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.453
He was brainwashed by HYDRA.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.163
He didn't know what he was doing.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.374
It took us months
to undo their dirty work.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.542
He's a good kid.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.793
He's a murderer.

10:25.876 --> 10:28.296
And he had a criminal record long
before HYDRA got their hands on him.

10:28.379 --> 10:30.464
He's from the streets.
He made some mistakes.

10:30.548 --> 10:32.133
He's reformed.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.468
I believe everyone deserves
a second chance,

10:34.552 --> 10:36.470
but taking him with us
on a covert mission

10:36.554 --> 10:37.888
doesn't seem like the place to test it.

10:38.014 --> 10:40.558
It's a crazy world out there,
full of powered people.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.976
I finally have one of my own.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.811
I don't leave home without him.

10:43.894 --> 10:45.396
What are you saying?

10:45.980 --> 10:47.481
He doesn't go, I don't go.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.900
Fine. We'll go without you.

10:50.026 --> 10:51.068
We don't need him.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.321
Actually, we do.

10:53.404 --> 10:55.406
If the acting head of our own ATCU
doesn't show up,

10:55.531 --> 10:56.907
it sends a bad message.

10:56.991 --> 10:58.576
Not to mention
it will embarrass the President

10:58.659 --> 11:01.078
and destroy any hope
of an international coalition.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.164
What are you saying?

11:04.081 --> 11:05.207
He goes.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.084
You can't be serious!

11:07.209 --> 11:08.753
This debate is over.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.841
I'm taking a big leap of faith.

11:13.924 --> 11:15.426
You better be right.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.345
I trust him with my life.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.763
If he steps out of line in any way,

11:18.888 --> 11:21.891
Lincoln and I will take him down
so hard, he'll never get up.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.602
Agent May,

11:24.727 --> 11:27.021
will you escort General Talbot
down to see Creel?

11:28.356 --> 11:29.774
Excuse me.

11:32.026 --> 11:33.194
I'm not kidding, I will hurt him.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.695
You're not on this op.

11:36.781 --> 11:38.032
What do you mean?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.367
I should be there.

11:39.450 --> 11:42.119
I agree, but there are
two rules for the symposium.

11:42.203 --> 11:44.372
The first is, no aliens.

11:44.455 --> 11:45.873
The delegates want to be able
to speak freely

11:45.956 --> 11:47.291
without fear of offending anyone.

11:47.375 --> 11:48.626
Yeah, well, it's too late for that.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.877
And what's the second rule?

11:49.960 --> 11:51.128
No weapons.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.880
And what are we supposed to do

11:52.963 --> 11:54.882
if someone else decides
not to play by those rules?

11:54.965 --> 11:57.718
That's why having Creel there
might not be such a bad idea.

11:57.802 --> 11:59.220
He's not Inhuman,

11:59.303 --> 12:01.055
so he'll pass any DNA screenings
they may have,

12:01.138 --> 12:03.641
and if he is truly reformed,
could be an asset.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.436
You can't take the bad out of a bad man.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.653
May I have a word?

12:30.668 --> 12:33.337
Your body isn't improving.

12:35.840 --> 12:39.260
Maybe a new host,
one not so damaged.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.345
I know you're not offering yourself.

12:41.846 --> 12:43.514
The host must be dead.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.100
Oh, no.

12:46.183 --> 12:49.770
I'm afraid this old body
wouldn't be the right choice.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.148
Perhaps Giyera, an Inhuman.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.943
I cannot inhabit Inhumans.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.154
We cannot feed on our own kind.

12:59.864 --> 13:03.868
Well, I'm sure I could find a volunteer.

13:03.993 --> 13:06.620
Grant Ward will serve my needs
until we're ready.

13:08.998 --> 13:10.875
Very well, then. Uh...

13:12.293 --> 13:16.380
I can assure you
there won't be any more setbacks.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.715
Good.

13:18.674 --> 13:20.468
We like to hear that.

13:43.032 --> 13:44.533
Briefing's about to start.

13:47.828 --> 13:48.829
Hunter.

13:48.913 --> 13:50.998
I'm tempted to throw him
off the plane right now.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.666
We made a deal with the devil
once before,

13:52.750 --> 13:54.502
and we all know how that worked out.

13:55.503 --> 13:57.087
Mission's more important.

13:57.213 --> 14:00.508
Aren't you tired of saying that?
'Cause I'm tired of hearing it.

14:00.591 --> 14:04.094
Certainly didn't apply when
your husband's life was on the line.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.514
Stating the obvious.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.433
I'm just here to make sure
my friends don't die.

14:09.517 --> 14:11.018
He has a habit of killing them.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.190
You're here for Bobbi.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.858
Nothing more.

14:17.942 --> 14:20.277
She's the only reason
why you call yourself an agent

14:20.361 --> 14:22.780
and why you couldn't care less
about the mission.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.115
Are you saying you'd rather have
that guy covering you than me?

14:25.241 --> 14:26.700
Honestly, not so sure.

14:26.784 --> 14:28.536
Well, that's no way to treat a friend

14:28.619 --> 14:30.454
who's just trying to watch your back.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.581
We're not friends.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.295
I'll carry on watching your back,
regardless.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.049
There will be five other delegates

14:42.132 --> 14:43.551
at the symposium with General Talbot.

14:43.634 --> 14:44.969
They have information that we need

14:45.052 --> 14:46.804
and that Malick
would like to get his hands on.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.808
Malick's obsession with Inhumans
continues, so it's likely

14:50.933 --> 14:53.477
that one of these delegates
is his inside man.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.895
- Or woman.
- Our mission?

14:54.979 --> 14:59.066
Collect intel on any foreign Inhumans
and uncover the insider

14:59.149 --> 15:00.568
so that we can track them
back to Malick.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.824
<i>The symposium kicks off with a
reception held by our Taiwanese hosts.</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:08.576
<i>All of the delegates
will be in attendance,</i>

15:08.659 --> 15:10.244
<i>along with their attachés,</i>

15:10.327 --> 15:14.164
<i>a small number of invited guests,
General Talbot, and myself.</i>

15:15.916 --> 15:17.334
I don't care what they call it.

15:17.459 --> 15:18.836
It's a dress.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.754
You must be loving this.

15:20.838 --> 15:23.173
You're the President's
official representative.

15:23.257 --> 15:26.844
It's a customary way to honour them
for hosting this symposium,

15:26.969 --> 15:30.097
and you look very dignified.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.474
It's all loosey-goosey under there.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.106
<i>I will be attending
as Dr Sean Lundwall,</i>

15:39.189 --> 15:41.692
<i>a CDC expert in alien biology.</i>

15:41.817 --> 15:44.111
<i>General Talbot,
as acting head of the ATCU,</i>

15:44.194 --> 15:45.362
<i>will attend as himself.</i>

15:45.487 --> 15:46.697
General Talbot?

15:47.698 --> 15:48.991
I recognised your face.

15:50.326 --> 15:51.368
Anton Petrov.

15:53.162 --> 15:56.123
Please thank your President
for organising this.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.125
I think we will all find it very valuable.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.711
This is Dr Lundwall from the CDC.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.963
Oh, uh... So sorry.

16:03.047 --> 16:05.966
Uh, I very much look forward
to your presentation.

16:06.050 --> 16:08.802
We have so much to learn
about these creatures.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.639
Excuse me, gentlemen.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.476
That's our guy.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.812
Because he called them "creatures"?

16:18.896 --> 16:19.897
Could be a mistranslation.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.315
Because he's Russian,

16:21.398 --> 16:24.735
and he's probably in cahoots
with that Sushiyaki.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.320
Yakimura?

16:26.403 --> 16:27.404
Yeah.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.823
<i>Talbot and I will find out
what we can at the reception.</i>

16:29.907 --> 16:32.326
<i>The rest is up to you
once the symposium starts.</i>

16:34.244 --> 16:37.581
<i>I've acquired a list
of the delegates' rooms.</i>

16:37.706 --> 16:40.501
<i>Those rooms are only accessible
with a full palm print.</i>

16:40.584 --> 16:42.002
So, how are we supposed to get in?

16:42.086 --> 16:44.421
Do you want us to cut their hands off?

16:44.546 --> 16:46.590
We won't need to
cut off any hands, but...

16:47.675 --> 16:49.927
I will need to shake a few.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.100
Ms Chen.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.686
Dr Sean Lundwall.
It's a beautiful place.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.937
Thank you for hosting.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.271
It's our pleasure.

17:22.126 --> 17:23.877
Fits like a glove.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.089
General Talbot.

17:28.132 --> 17:30.217
I must say, I'm quite honoured

17:30.300 --> 17:31.969
that you're wearing
our traditional long gown.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.637
Well, the honour's all mine.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.472
I don't put on a dress for just anyone.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.892
I don't think we've met.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.477
Ellen King.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.063
Have you found
a cure for them, Doctor?

17:43.147 --> 17:44.398
A cure needs a disease.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.233
Interesting.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.569
I'm sure you'll enlighten us all later.

17:48.652 --> 17:49.653
Excuse us.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.325
I think it's Chen.

17:55.451 --> 17:57.578
She's too nice. Never trust nice.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.664
Although, did you see the scar
on Down Under's face?

18:00.789 --> 18:02.583
Maybe she tangled
with one of the Inhumans,

18:02.666 --> 18:04.835
got her all hot-headed, you know?

18:04.960 --> 18:06.587
- Congratulations.
- Hmm?

18:06.670 --> 18:08.756
You've just narrowed it down
to everyone.

18:11.675 --> 18:14.928
Don't leave his side until I return.
I'm concerned about the way he looks.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.096
You call me if anything changes.

18:16.180 --> 18:18.307
Yes, sir. Hail HYDRA.

18:25.522 --> 18:29.151
Despite what he just said, I'm gonna
need you both to leave my side.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.612
What do you need?

18:31.695 --> 18:34.156
Humans. Five of them.

18:37.201 --> 18:38.202
Alive.

18:41.872 --> 18:42.873
I'm not gonna fight you.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.291
It's not fighting.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.375
It's training.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.880
We finally found a night off together,

18:50.005 --> 18:51.799
and this is what you want to do?

18:51.882 --> 18:55.719
We could be lounging
or binge-watching some show or...

18:55.844 --> 18:57.137
I need to blow off some steam,

18:57.221 --> 19:00.724
and you need to get ready for your
agent assessment at the Cocoon.

19:00.808 --> 19:02.810
Yeah, can't wait. More time apart.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.561
I like it when you miss me.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.483
No powers.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.984
Okay?

19:11.068 --> 19:12.486
Just you and me.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.245
You're getting better.

19:21.370 --> 19:23.163
Is this how you've been
spending your free time?

19:23.247 --> 19:24.414
What free time?

19:39.930 --> 19:42.015
I think you're starting to like
spending time in the field.

19:42.850 --> 19:44.518
That rush of adrenaline.

19:50.065 --> 19:52.109
Not so sure the field is my thing.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.279
What's your thing?

19:55.404 --> 19:56.530
Don't know.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.781
- Maybe it's you.
- Oh.

19:57.865 --> 19:58.907
I'm so sorry.

20:00.868 --> 20:02.953
Um, there's something going on
with Creel's DNA sample.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.123
I could really use a doctor
who understands Inhuman biology.

20:07.291 --> 20:10.043
Well, I happen to have
one of those right here.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.422
Go do your thing.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.135
We're gonna pick this up
right where we left off.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.972
Have a seat, please.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.057
I trust you've all had
a chance to recover,

20:24.141 --> 20:27.227
freshen up from that reception.

20:27.311 --> 20:30.314
I got to say, it's nice to finally put
a series of faces

20:30.439 --> 20:32.900
to all your unpronounceable names.

20:35.152 --> 20:37.654
Uh, okay, well,
on behalf of President Ellis,

20:37.779 --> 20:40.240
I'd like to thank you all
for gathering here.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.742
As I'm sure you're all aware,

20:41.825 --> 20:43.911
there have been rumours,
reports, and sightings

20:43.994 --> 20:47.915
of a new breed of alien living among us.

20:47.998 --> 20:51.501
Now, it's our hope that,
by working together,

20:51.585 --> 20:54.755
we can come to a consensus about
how to deal with these aliens.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.007
We can start by not calling them aliens.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.176
They prefer the term "Inhumans."

20:59.259 --> 21:00.594
What kind of a name is that?

21:00.677 --> 21:04.097
Is it meant to intimidate us, mock us?

21:04.181 --> 21:06.016
Not at all.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.684
They're just trying
to find their place in the world,

21:07.809 --> 21:09.603
but they're more human
than anything else,

21:09.686 --> 21:11.355
<i>and I think it's important
that we see them that way.</i>

21:11.480 --> 21:13.315
King sounds a little hostile.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.033
I'm in. Haruto Yakimura's room.

21:24.201 --> 21:27.204
It's not a virus or a disease.
It can't be spread.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.122
It's a genetic anomaly

21:29.206 --> 21:32.709
that affects a very,
very small percentage of the population,

21:32.834 --> 21:34.378
but they're as human as we are,

21:34.503 --> 21:36.546
just with a little something extra.

21:36.630 --> 21:40.550
Unfortunately, this "something extra"
could destroy us all.

21:40.676 --> 21:43.136
That depends on whether we
make them our friends or our enemies.

21:43.220 --> 21:45.973
We should think of them
as an opportunity.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.474
An opportunity for compassion.

21:47.557 --> 21:51.895
I agree. Uh, these Inhumans
are not our enemies.

21:51.979 --> 21:54.481
In fact, should their numbers increase,

21:54.564 --> 21:58.735
my country is prepared
to establish a home for them

21:58.819 --> 22:02.739
within our borders, a sanctuary state,

22:02.823 --> 22:05.242
<i>where they could live in peace
if they so choose,</i>

22:05.367 --> 22:07.411
<i>build a community,
teach us about themselves.</i>

22:07.536 --> 22:09.079
All the Inhumans in one spot?

22:09.204 --> 22:11.081
That's one-stop shopping for Malick.

22:11.206 --> 22:12.499
I'm putting my money
on this guy Petrov.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.836
Whether they are human or alien
is not the issue.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.755
Their powers are the issue.
And let's face it.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.092
Each of our nations would rather have
that power on our side.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.927
This is an arms race,

22:24.052 --> 22:26.847
and sending any Inhumans
we may find off to Russia

22:26.930 --> 22:28.682
is like sending them
our nuclear weapons.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.017
They are not weapons.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.768
Weapons or not,

22:31.852 --> 22:34.604
I think this is a very naive
and dangerous proposition.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.023
To put them all in one place?

22:36.106 --> 22:38.525
They could organise,
rise up against us.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.444
There are hardly
enough of them to be...

22:40.527 --> 22:42.029
Not yet.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.613
But who knows
how many more are coming?

22:43.739 --> 22:44.781
<i>Are you
listening to this, Hunter?</i>

22:44.906 --> 22:46.783
I'm listening.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.535
<i>The Australian sounds paranoid.</i>

22:48.618 --> 22:50.037
I'm in her room now.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.622
Whatever she's hiding, I'll find it.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.130
Bloody hell. I knew it.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.423
Creel's leaving his post.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.760
Making a run for it.

23:09.639 --> 23:13.977
Here we have a sample of Daisy's blood
taken two years ago,

23:14.102 --> 23:15.937
before she was exposed to Terrigen.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.239
When we add the Terrigen...

23:27.616 --> 23:29.743
The reaction is what we'd expect.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.078
Terrigenesis.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.830
Dr Fitz, if you wouldn't mind...

23:34.831 --> 23:36.166
Here, we have the same blood,

23:36.249 --> 23:40.420
but watch what happens when we add
a sample of Creel's blood to the mix.

23:49.096 --> 23:51.348
It not only stops
the Terrigenesis process,

23:52.641 --> 23:54.184
it breaks it down.

23:55.352 --> 23:58.188
Creel's blood is protecting hers.

23:58.271 --> 24:00.107
A vaccine against Terrigenesis.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.358
Potentially.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.777
It can't reverse the effects
once someone's transformed, but...

24:03.860 --> 24:05.028
This could virtually put an end to...

24:05.153 --> 24:06.196
To us?

24:09.032 --> 24:11.701
I'm sorry, but isn't that
what you were gonna say?

24:11.785 --> 24:15.205
We do not believe the Inhumans
are a plague or weapons.

24:15.705 --> 24:19.042
I support Mr Petrov's sanctuary state,

24:19.167 --> 24:21.211
and I propose we vote on the matter.

24:21.336 --> 24:22.546
I second that.

24:28.218 --> 24:31.555
If the Russki turns out
to be the inside man,

24:31.680 --> 24:33.640
this vote could be a bad thing for us.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.643
We've got three yeas, two nays.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.645
If I vote yea,

24:38.728 --> 24:41.148
he's gonna have a lot
of Inhumans in his backyard

24:41.231 --> 24:43.859
when the sun comes up, you know?

24:50.699 --> 24:52.159
We've caught
an encrypted text going out.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.162
Looks like it's from Ellen King.
Hunter, are you in her room?

24:55.245 --> 24:57.330
<i>Hunter's off mission.
He's chasing Creel.</i>

24:57.414 --> 24:59.374
<i>- Can you decrypt the message?</i>
- Decrypting.

25:01.918 --> 25:05.755
"Move... Him... Now."

25:05.839 --> 25:07.090
We need to get in her room.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.925
Copy that.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.028
That truck looks like
a good place to hide.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.863
Easy way out.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.783
Oh, guns.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.911
Why does no one ever listen to me?

26:16.743 --> 26:18.578
May, I've got something.

26:18.662 --> 26:22.499
She's got an Inhuman locked up
and sedated for military experiments,

26:22.624 --> 26:25.001
but I'm not seeing a Malick connection.

26:25.085 --> 26:27.337
<i>- Any word from Hunter?</i>
- Radio silence.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.534
Bobbi and May, we've been set up.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.911
We need to get Coulson
and Talbot out of there now.

27:06.001 --> 27:08.795
Before we vote,
I'd like to thank Dr Lundwall

27:08.878 --> 27:10.880
for helping us
to better understand Inhumans.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.424
Yes.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.426
If the vote is passed,

27:14.509 --> 27:16.511
and the sanctuary state is approved,

27:16.594 --> 27:18.013
it will in no small part be each of...

27:18.096 --> 27:19.472
I'm sorry.

27:19.556 --> 27:22.350
I'm gonna have to postpone this vote.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.560
Guards!

27:25.729 --> 27:29.691
It has come to my attention
that we have a traitor among us.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.197
Arrest this man.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.701
What the hell are you doing?

27:39.784 --> 27:41.661
What is the meaning
of this, General?

27:42.203 --> 27:43.246
He's been spying on us.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.165
Talbot, stop this.

27:45.248 --> 27:48.251
This man has violated our lives,

27:48.335 --> 27:50.462
he's violated our rooms,

27:51.379 --> 27:53.089
and he's violated our trust.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.136
He's a liar...

27:58.219 --> 28:00.138
And a fraud.

28:00.221 --> 28:03.224
This man is not Dr Sean Lundwall.

28:06.061 --> 28:08.730
- His real name is...
- This is Phil Coulson.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.568
The director of HYDRA.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.782
You're the inside man.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.743
<i>Kumbaya.</i>

28:31.503 --> 28:35.048
I hate to be a buzzkill,
but this is a gun-free zone,

28:35.131 --> 28:37.467
so I'm gonna have to take that off you.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.685
Hunter, what's going on?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.104
They've got Talbot's son.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.857
- What?
- I'm pretty sure it's him.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.359
In one of those gel-matrix cubes.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.277
Malick.

28:56.361 --> 28:57.737
He's blackmailing Talbot.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.572
- Why would he do that?
- To betray Coulson.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.116
Standard-issue HYDRA.

29:01.199 --> 29:02.450
Print detection
so no one else can use it.

29:02.534 --> 29:03.910
Great. Coulson's in trouble,

29:03.993 --> 29:06.079
the place is crawling
with armed HYDRA agents,

29:06.162 --> 29:07.872
and we have no weapons.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.624
Not strictly true.

29:12.877 --> 29:13.920
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

29:14.546 --> 29:15.797
I love you.

29:19.008 --> 29:20.468
I don't hate you quite as much.

29:25.682 --> 29:27.976
You two, find Coulson and Talbot.

29:28.059 --> 29:29.686
I'll find Talbot's son.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.317
<i>We can't save everyone, Daisy.</i>

29:36.401 --> 29:39.654
And not everyone
who can change should change.

29:39.737 --> 29:41.781
That's why Jiaying
was so selective at Afterlife.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.325
- She was also crazy.
- Not about this.

29:44.409 --> 29:46.327
There is a balance
that has to be maintained.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.954
Things are getting way out of whack.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.706
A vaccine might not be a bad thing.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.416
Do you even hear what you're saying?

29:51.499 --> 29:52.959
You sound like
one of those hate groups

29:53.042 --> 29:54.461
that's been trolling the Internet.

29:54.544 --> 29:56.796
"The Watchdogs," or whatever
they're calling themselves.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.548
"Kill the aliens
and take back the planet."

29:58.631 --> 30:00.842
That's not what this is about.
It's about giving people a choice.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.636
It's a birthright. It is not a choice.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.139
And maybe things are getting
out of whack because it's our time.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.016
Do you think it was Lash's time?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.226
Was it his birthright?

30:10.310 --> 30:13.188
Don't you think Dr Garner
would have liked to have had a choice?

30:13.271 --> 30:14.814
All I know is that if the government

30:14.898 --> 30:17.859
got their hands on a vaccine,
it won't be a choice.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.486
They will wipe us out.

30:19.569 --> 30:21.946
We do not have a disease, Lincoln.

30:22.030 --> 30:24.365
Technically,
it is a disease. I studied this.

30:24.449 --> 30:26.868
Any disturbance of structure
or function of the body...

30:26.951 --> 30:30.038
Oh, boy, someone went to med school,
so everyone shut up and listen.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.332
Yeah, I wasn't hacking my way
through life.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.803
Some of you know me.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.892
You know that I served
on the World Security Council.

30:50.975 --> 30:54.145
You know the good works
that my foundations do.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.106
Some of you don't know me yet,
but you will.

31:00.151 --> 31:02.445
We'll work together
to do good for the world.

31:03.988 --> 31:07.283
But what do you know of Phil Coulson,

31:07.367 --> 31:08.493
a man who claims

31:08.576 --> 31:11.996
to feel compassionately
about these Inhumans?

31:14.415 --> 31:17.252
Let's peel away some of the layers

31:17.335 --> 31:19.504
and see what's inside.

31:29.806 --> 31:32.934
Phil Coulson is no friend
to the Inhumans.

31:33.017 --> 31:35.728
In fact, he'd like to exterminate them,

31:35.812 --> 31:38.147
which is why he was trying
to manipulate this group

31:38.231 --> 31:39.607
into putting them all in one place.

31:39.691 --> 31:40.775
He's lying.

31:40.858 --> 31:42.777
That's not what I want.
That's what he wants.

31:44.445 --> 31:46.239
You're all welcome to believe him,

31:46.322 --> 31:48.366
but my reputation speaks for itself.

31:51.619 --> 31:54.664
This is a gel-matrix tank.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.499
Mr Coulson developed the technology

31:56.583 --> 31:58.668
to keep the Inhumans
in suspended animation,

31:58.751 --> 32:00.920
but, in fact,
with a mere flick of a switch,

32:01.004 --> 32:03.464
from any remote location,
he could shut them off,

32:03.548 --> 32:04.674
killing them instantly.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.594
I think we've had enough
of Mr Coulson.

32:07.677 --> 32:11.014
Let's lock him up
until the officials arrive.

32:11.097 --> 32:15.310
What did he do?
Who does he have? Talbot!

32:25.570 --> 32:27.947
These are
the healthiest we could find.

32:28.031 --> 32:31.075
Lucio has frozen them in place for you.

32:31.159 --> 32:32.952
I hope they're acceptable.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.913
Yes.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.373
Well done.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.210
One will be your host?

32:41.294 --> 32:43.546
I have a better use for them.

32:51.971 --> 32:53.973
Yes, they are innocents.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.852
But they will serve the greater good.

33:27.632 --> 33:29.759
You gentlemen interested
in changing jobs?

33:30.718 --> 33:32.053
Good guys are hiring.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.805
You don't get to kill people
in cold blood,

33:33.888 --> 33:35.682
but we got
a really good retirement plan.

33:36.683 --> 33:37.892
Where's your boss?

33:37.975 --> 33:40.311
Didn't have the guts to do this himself?

33:40.395 --> 33:41.562
Yes.

33:43.189 --> 33:47.360
But I also have money to pay people
to do my menial jobs.

33:47.443 --> 33:48.778
All right, I kept my end of the bargain.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.824
I delivered Coulson.
All the delegates are on your side.

33:53.282 --> 33:54.951
Now give me back my son.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.286
Malick, you son of a bitch.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.045
I'm sorry.

34:06.129 --> 34:07.338
I can't do that.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.257
No. We had a deal!

34:13.344 --> 34:15.346
Yes, but, unfortunately,

34:15.429 --> 34:18.141
you must all be sacrificed
to the greater good.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.650
Why go to all this trouble?

34:28.735 --> 34:30.445
I'm building an army.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.697
And another army
will stand to fight them.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.574
You won't be able to convert them all.

34:35.742 --> 34:37.034
I won't have to.

34:38.119 --> 34:39.536
Kill them.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.043
Do me a favour and shoot him first.

34:47.128 --> 34:50.547
I'd like one moment of peace
before I go.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.382
You didn't know
he was gonna double-cross you?

34:52.467 --> 34:53.634
He is HYDRA. Just sayin'.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.928
I knew he's... Do you think I don't know?
Do you think I'm stupid?

34:56.012 --> 34:57.054
Then what are you doing in here?

34:57.138 --> 34:58.181
Doesn't seem like a very smart plan.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.099
I have an inside man.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.783
Like I said, I trust him with my life.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.203
Where's my son?

35:20.995 --> 35:22.079
He's still with HYDRA.

35:22.163 --> 35:23.998
Hunter found him,
but he almost blew my cover.

35:24.081 --> 35:27.376
I had to hurt him... A little.

35:27.460 --> 35:28.669
Come on. Open this thing up.

35:28.753 --> 35:30.546
Bust these cuffs off us.

35:33.633 --> 35:35.718
- Go on! Get out of here!
- Give me a hand!

35:36.594 --> 35:38.346
- Got it!
- Let's go!

35:46.938 --> 35:48.105
What do you want to do with this hand?

35:48.189 --> 35:49.273
It's kind of freaking me out.

35:49.357 --> 35:51.317
Stop, stop. Give me that.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.237
Why didn't you tell me
Malick had George?

35:54.320 --> 35:55.613
I couldn't.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.032
He took him as soon
as I was appointed to the ATCU.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.326
Told me he'd kill him with
the push of a button if I told anybody.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.619
He's the kind of guy
who would do exactly that.

36:01.702 --> 36:02.745
And Carla?

36:02.829 --> 36:04.121
She knows. She blames me.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.331
I sent her someplace safe.

36:05.414 --> 36:08.543
Come on. We're gonna fix this.
We're gonna fix everything.

36:12.296 --> 36:14.131
Were we the only ones
that got the "no weapons" memo?

36:14.215 --> 36:15.716
I'm bored of this. Cover me.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.698
We're in the conference room.

36:38.781 --> 36:40.408
No sign of Coulson or...

36:49.792 --> 36:51.210
That doesn't make us even.

36:51.294 --> 36:52.712
Creel!

37:00.761 --> 37:02.346
Where's my son?

37:02.430 --> 37:03.639
Where's my son?

37:03.723 --> 37:05.182
I don't know.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.103
I need you to find Malick.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.938
There's only one road
between here and the airfield,

37:11.022 --> 37:12.356
so there's a chance he hasn't left.

37:12.440 --> 37:14.609
If you find him, stay with him.
I want to know where he's going.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.361
The rest of us will try
to find Talbot's son.

37:17.445 --> 37:19.780
<i>Yeah, Coulson, about that...</i>

37:53.814 --> 37:55.024
I'm sorry.

37:56.901 --> 38:00.196
Sorry I got a little militant
about the vaccine.

38:01.572 --> 38:04.033
I don't know
what's going on with me right now.

38:05.493 --> 38:07.328
You know, I'm envious of you.

38:10.164 --> 38:11.540
Why is that?

38:13.960 --> 38:18.422
You have this
natural Zen thing with your powers.

38:20.508 --> 38:22.134
Maybe you got it from your mom,

38:23.469 --> 38:25.429
or hanging around May.

38:25.513 --> 38:28.975
Whatever it is, I wish I had it.

38:29.058 --> 38:32.311
What are you talking about?
You were like...

38:32.395 --> 38:34.730
You were like the Zen master
when we were at Afterlife.

38:34.814 --> 38:36.816
It was easy there.

38:36.899 --> 38:39.443
No stress, no fear.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.989
Here... Not so much.

38:45.783 --> 38:47.952
Well, maybe I can help you.

38:48.661 --> 38:50.621
I don't know if it can be helped.

38:52.123 --> 38:56.168
For you, controlling
your power is like finding peace.

38:57.211 --> 39:00.589
For me, it's a war inside my head.

39:02.967 --> 39:05.344
I just don't want to lose control.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.681
Sometimes, it's good to lose control.

39:37.877 --> 39:40.046
He's gonna be okay.

39:40.129 --> 39:42.298
He just needs some rest.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.176
He won't remember any of it.

39:45.259 --> 39:48.054
Carla will be very happy
to know you made it right.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.431
Well...

39:51.891 --> 39:53.309
I had a little help.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.353
That's what partners are for, General.

39:58.064 --> 39:59.315
Call me Glenn.

40:02.109 --> 40:03.277
Occasionally.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.322
I'll leave you alone now.

40:08.991 --> 40:12.411
I informed our agents down under
about Ellen King's Inhuman.

40:12.495 --> 40:14.580
They managed to get him out.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.916
He's still sedated, but getting treatment.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.542
Any word from Bobbi or Hunter?

40:18.626 --> 40:19.877
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.

40:21.754 --> 40:23.923
There's one more thing.

40:24.006 --> 40:25.049
What?

40:25.132 --> 40:27.134
Malick is supposed to be
the last head of HYDRA,

40:27.218 --> 40:29.887
but I can't shake this feeling

40:29.970 --> 40:31.555
that he's reporting to someone else.

40:32.181 --> 40:33.766
Someone more powerful than Malick?

40:33.849 --> 40:36.769
Someone or something.

41:27.611 --> 41:30.823
I hope your experience
with Coulson didn't sour you.

41:31.991 --> 41:34.869
It's still a noble and worthwhile idea,

41:35.703 --> 41:38.164
and I'd like to help you
any way that I can.

41:39.707 --> 41:41.125
Thank you, Mr Malick,

41:41.208 --> 41:43.669
and thank you
for this incredible ride home.

41:44.587 --> 41:46.672
It's my pleasure. Anything for a friend.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.300
There are a few obstacles
in my country,

41:49.383 --> 41:50.843
but with your influence,

41:50.926 --> 41:52.928
we should be able to work them all out,

41:53.012 --> 41:55.764
and then we shall have
our sanctuary state.

41:55.848 --> 41:58.267
To a place where all Inhumans
can live peacefully

41:58.350 --> 42:00.561
