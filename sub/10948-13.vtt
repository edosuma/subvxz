- Not needed.

under control.

But he was quickly expunged.

- Why are you all looking at me?
- You're the idea guy.

could ever come up with a plan?

a good Freedom Fighter.

way in the world, like us.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.030
You don't know
anything about him, Jet.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.490

scar from a Waterbender.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.910
Besides, I thought we
were going straight now.

could use a guy like Lee.

And then she cartwheeled away.

and its weak points.

down all these big Earthbenders.
