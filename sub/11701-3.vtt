Once I've stripped you of your tits,
I'll show you the real Franky Doyle.

00:04.330 --> 00:07.810
Stop calling, stop writing. Think
about what's best for Debbie.

00:08.130 --> 00:09.770
Your gut says to keep calling her, right?

00:09.890 --> 00:11.490
Yeah, but it's not fair on her.

00:12.050 --> 00:14.690
You're her mum. She loves
you and you've given up.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.530
How do you reckon she feels?

00:16.730 --> 00:18.490
Steven was one of my first appointments

00:18.570 --> 00:21.690
and he's made incredible progress
with the women's vocab and reading.

00:22.730 --> 00:24.890
- Where did you get it?
- The smack fairy.

00:26.210 --> 00:27.250
She deserves a bit of fun,

00:27.330 --> 00:29.410
but you're so off your face all
the time you don't even care.

00:29.650 --> 00:30.770
Toni, you're off your nut, aren't you?

00:30.970 --> 00:32.170
STEVEN: You've got to help me.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.010
- You supplied her?
- What if it gets out?

00:34.090 --> 00:36.890
It won't. I'll make it go away. Now,
get your things and leave the prison.

00:37.650 --> 00:38.730
Mum?

00:39.970 --> 00:40.970
Yeah, it's me.

00:41.570 --> 00:44.050
I've been tutoring Franky
for the last 12 months.

00:44.290 --> 00:46.850
- Tutoring, dating. Same, same.
- Very different.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.570
It's well-seasoned, it's crispy.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.250
You're setting a high benchmark
for the rest of the competition.

01:56.410 --> 01:57.490
Francesca...

02:00.130 --> 02:02.290
You think you've nailed it this time? Yeah?

02:09.210 --> 02:10.330
What do you call that, Francesca?

02:10.650 --> 02:11.810
Tupura vegetables.

02:12.170 --> 02:14.770
Tupura vegetables? That's a new
one. I haven't heard that one before.

02:16.650 --> 02:18.850
- Try, try this one.
- It's okay. I've had better.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.050
Maybe you should stop this
smartass attitude of yours

02:23.130 --> 02:24.970
and just start trying to be smart,

02:25.170 --> 02:27.410
because you keep serving
up this sort of slop,

02:27.690 --> 02:29.570
I'm gonna have to keep
spitting it in the bin.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.850
Francesca, I don't know if you
have the intelligence to keep going.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.730
At this stage of the competition,
I expect it to be better.

02:39.930 --> 02:42.170
Maybe you should stick to
something that's not beyond you,

02:42.650 --> 02:44.330
like, um, eggs.

02:46.610 --> 02:47.970
Eggs...

02:48.330 --> 02:50.730
You can say eggs, Francesca. Eggs!

02:52.810 --> 02:54.410
Can we cut it? Can we cut it there?

02:59.450 --> 03:03.210
Hey, Francesca, keep up this dumb act and
we will make some beautiful television.

Dor, not the machine.

04:11.690 --> 04:13.730

04:15.130 --> 04:16.170
Here.

04:17.570 --> 04:18.730
Come on. I'll fix it. You fold.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.690
No, no, no. You can't just swap jobs.

04:20.769 --> 04:23.370
- It's okay, I'll be quick. It's all right.
- No, no, no, Bea...

04:23.810 --> 04:26.010
- No, you can't just swap jobs.
- Come on.

04:26.290 --> 04:28.330
Go on, just go. Quick.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.010
I know what I'm doing. I've
worked on these machines before.

04:39.010 --> 04:41.770
You seem like the kind of mother
that'd make clothes for your daughter.

04:41.970 --> 04:42.970
Yeah.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.610
How is Mini Bea?

04:45.290 --> 04:46.770
She still hasn't visited, has she?

04:47.010 --> 04:48.490
Yeah. She's coming in tomorrow.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.650
Finally. How nice for you.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.450
Calls for a celebration.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.850
I need the bathroom, say,
for the next five minutes,

04:55.050 --> 04:57.610
the steam press is all
yours. Special treat.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.770
Thanks, but I've never used one before.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.010
Now's your chance.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.770
No, it's okay, seriously.

05:04.650 --> 05:08.090
Bea, I decide where everyone's stationed.

05:09.010 --> 05:11.170
If someone else has an opinion,
the whole system falls apart.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.410
We don't want that, do we?

05:13.130 --> 05:16.410
Systems are important here.
They keep everyone in line.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.890
Now, come on, have a go. It's an honor.

05:20.130 --> 05:21.730
You'll be able to tell Debbie all about it.

05:22.330 --> 05:26.970
Just lay out the sheet,
smooth it out, and...

05:27.730 --> 05:30.290

05:33.650 --> 05:34.690
Waiting.

05:35.330 --> 05:38.370

05:39.490 --> 05:40.770
You know what you're doing. I don't.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.170

to lighten things up in here?

05:54.570 --> 05:56.130

05:56.690 --> 05:59.410
Leave the crusty sheets
to the expert, Jacqueline.

05:59.730 --> 06:02.330
I was just showing Bea
how to use the press.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.530
Oh, you don't want to do that, Red.

06:05.010 --> 06:07.010
All that steam will stuff your hair.

Ronnie, take over.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.730
- I'll be back.
- Have a good run, Jacs.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.530
Thanks for that.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.330
You just got in the game, Red.

06:37.210 --> 06:38.930
Franky, the Governor wants to see you.

06:39.130 --> 06:42.010

07:03.570 --> 07:05.010
- Ooh...
- Franky Doyle, Governor.

07:05.170 --> 07:06.450
You made yourself comfortable.

07:06.650 --> 07:07.770
Have a seat, Franky.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.210
Foxy.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.050
What, no coffee?

07:12.450 --> 07:14.210
Ah, a double espresso, milk on the side.

07:14.290 --> 07:16.650
- Thanks, Miss Miles.
- Thank you, Miss Miles.

07:17.530 --> 07:18.770
There's that smile.

07:20.050 --> 07:24.530
So... The subject of your father
has always been off limits,

07:24.930 --> 07:26.810
which I respect, but

07:28.690 --> 07:31.170
you have received another
letter from Alan Doyle.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.530
We've noticed you haven't
replied to the others.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.930
- Why would I?
- That's my question.

07:36.010 --> 07:39.690
Do you think it's an impostor
or a potential threat?

07:40.690 --> 07:42.890
I can hand this over to the
police and they can warn them off.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.650
Would you like to look at the letter first?

07:52.090 --> 07:53.210
No.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.170
- How did you get that?
- What?

07:57.090 --> 07:58.530
On your chest. How did you get that?

07:59.890 --> 08:01.970
- What, that?
- Yes.

08:03.090 --> 08:05.130
It's Kim. She bites.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.530
Did that happen during the riot?

08:08.090 --> 08:09.730
Or did Jacs do that to you?

08:10.650 --> 08:13.810
I don't want things to escalate
the way they did with Mrs. Jackson.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.210
If there's any chance of any
reprisals, I need to know.

08:17.290 --> 08:19.290
- This is the only way I can protect you.
- You know what?

08:20.130 --> 08:22.930
Next time you want to hang out,
don't forget the coffee, eh?

08:25.170 --> 08:26.250
Can I go?

going through my stuff?

know where the hole is, love.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.010
I know my strengths, Francesca.

09:20.490 --> 09:21.650
Aren't they failing by now?

09:21.810 --> 09:23.650
The last time I wielded
something in my hands,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.410
I was very happy with the results.

09:27.090 --> 09:29.770

- Give me the ball. Come on.

Playing with yourself?

09:40.730 --> 09:42.930
You heard of any more tension
between Jacs and Franky?

09:43.690 --> 09:44.970
There's always going to be tension.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.890
So how do we resolve it
so it doesn't happen again?

09:48.570 --> 09:50.570
Well, there's three ways it can end.

09:50.810 --> 09:52.170
Someone gets released,

09:52.490 --> 09:54.850
backs down or ends up dead.

your reflexes, Miss Davidson.

In those conditions, is it any wonder?

12:41.170 --> 12:42.210
Well,

12:42.290 --> 12:44.690
the whole purpose of the wet
cells is to isolate the women

12:44.770 --> 12:45.770
and to prevent self-harm.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.610
Yeah, what about their basic human rights?

12:47.690 --> 12:50.090
They don't have a proper bed, they
can't shower or brush their teeth.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.650
We do try and keep them in there
for as short a time as possible.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.850
No. Toni has been in
there for nearly two weeks.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.170
She's in a depressed state,
she hasn't even seen a psych.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.250
Yeah, well, that's not actually
something we can control.

12:59.450 --> 13:01.090
You know there's not
enough psychs to go around,

13:01.170 --> 13:02.850
and when they do come, the
women don't wanna talk to them.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.210
That stinks. I can't wear that.

13:04.970 --> 13:07.090
No, there has to be a
better way to manage this.

13:07.650 --> 13:11.050
Yeah, there probably is, but, you know,
we'd need more officers to cover it.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.210
You take someone off one
area, you've got to cover that.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.450
You're looking at extra shifts.

13:14.610 --> 13:16.450
Well, they're not the ones
choking on bread rolls.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.370
They're just gonna have to
put up with the extra duties.

13:22.290 --> 13:23.890
Okay. (TAKES DEEP BREATH)

13:24.930 --> 13:26.730
You know, Erica, when you first took over,

13:26.890 --> 13:29.050
you didn't have a lot of
support from the officers.

13:29.610 --> 13:31.810
So, if you start making all these changes

13:31.890 --> 13:33.090
when they're stretched enough as it is,

13:33.170 --> 13:34.890
you're just gonna lose
their support altogether.

13:37.290 --> 13:38.410
What would you do?

13:41.130 --> 13:43.810
I wouldn't push the
officers so hard just yet.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.930
Settle in first, don't give
them a reason to give you grief.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.130
If the press get wind of
conditions in those cells,

13:51.250 --> 13:53.010
it's a public relations nightmare.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.610
Okay, but you also have to know the
officers around here have your back.

13:55.690 --> 13:57.330

the person mailing the drugs,

else you'd like to discuss?

I'd like to discuss.

Look, I know there's a system
in place for the wet cells,

15:41.130 --> 15:43.690

time to review it and update it.

15:44.450 --> 15:47.530
Let's introduce a process that makes
life easier for you in the long run,

15:47.730 --> 15:49.450
and improves conditions for the women.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.370
What kind of changes?

15:51.690 --> 15:54.250
Well, for starters, let's get the
women to a bathroom once a day,

15:54.330 --> 15:55.570
so they can shower and brush their teeth.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.690
- We don't have the time.
- Who's gonna do that?

15:57.770 --> 15:59.490
Obviously, there'll be
changes to the roster.

15:59.570 --> 16:00.650
I'm not working extra.

16:00.730 --> 16:02.010
We're under the pump as it is, Erica.

16:02.130 --> 16:04.010
Vera, I need you to get the women

16:04.090 --> 16:06.530

within 24 hours of admission.

- WILL: You've got to be kidding!
- Good luck making that phone call.

16:08.530 --> 16:10.330
And that the peer worker visits them daily,

16:10.410 --> 16:12.570
this will give the women someone
to talk to and confide in.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.050
So now Liz has the run of the prison?

What about us? Our safety?

it's gonna put us all at risk. Yeah?

Since when is the prisoners'
welfare more important than ours?

16:21.210 --> 16:23.490
This will lessen your
workload in the long run.

leaving worse than they went in.

26:51.450 --> 26:52.530
My fault.

26:53.690 --> 26:55.290
I called the TV show.

26:56.330 --> 26:58.090
I told the producers who I
was, said I wanted to see you.

26:58.170 --> 27:01.250
They wanted to put it all
on camera. I couldn't do it.

27:01.810 --> 27:03.010
You did what you did.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.410
Maybe I could have stopped you.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.570
Yeah.

27:08.610 --> 27:10.850
Maybe it would have been
you with third-degree burns.

27:12.450 --> 27:13.530
I love you.

27:15.890 --> 27:17.890
Don't you fucking dare say that.

27:19.090 --> 27:20.930
Don't you fucking dare!

27:21.850 --> 27:25.850
I don't even recognize you, and
that's what pisses me off the most.

27:26.450 --> 27:28.610
You don't look like him.
You don't sound like him.

27:28.770 --> 27:31.290
If my dad walked in here, this
glass wouldn't have stopped me.

27:32.570 --> 27:34.130
I would have smashed the fucking glass and

27:34.210 --> 27:35.970
then I would have smashed his fucking face.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.570
But he didn't walk in.

27:38.930 --> 27:40.490
He sent you.

27:41.370 --> 27:45.570
Some prick who wants to talk about
feelings and issues and bullshit!

27:51.810 --> 27:54.010
- Franky, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You know what?

27:55.970 --> 27:57.970
I waited years for him to come back.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.810
I stood at that bedroom window every night,

28:03.050 --> 28:05.090
and every night, he let me down.

28:05.650 --> 28:08.530
Even when social services
took me away from that bitch

28:08.610 --> 28:11.090
and put me somewhere new, I kept waiting.

28:13.210 --> 28:16.450
I imagined him running in
the front door, picking me up

28:16.530 --> 28:19.610
and squeezing my hand like he
used to, and taking me with him...

28:19.690 --> 28:21.410
- I'm sorry...
- I haven't finished!

28:26.010 --> 28:27.690
But he didn't walk in, did he?

28:28.610 --> 28:30.690
So I started thinking of
the day I'd get back at him,

28:31.330 --> 28:33.130
hurt him, yeah?

28:33.410 --> 28:35.410
I started thinking about that day.

28:35.890 --> 28:38.130
And then you fucking walk in!

28:44.650 --> 28:46.330
And you're not even him anymore.

28:49.690 --> 28:51.410
(BEEPING)

28:53.610 --> 28:55.250
You even took that away from me.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.290
Eh?

29:22.970 --> 29:24.130
(WHISPERS) Debbie...

29:26.770 --> 29:28.530
- Can we...
- Yeah, yeah. Come here.

29:32.890 --> 29:34.050
(SOBBING)

29:42.450 --> 29:45.050
- Mum, I didn't...
- You look, you look good.

29:46.650 --> 29:49.730
I didn't know if I could
bring anything or...

29:49.890 --> 29:52.970
Oh, yeah, yeah, you can.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.010
They just have to process
it and we get it later.

29:55.410 --> 29:56.730
Do you want anything?

29:58.850 --> 30:00.250
I've got everything I need.

30:00.530 --> 30:01.810
(CHUCKLES)

30:03.690 --> 30:07.490
Um, so, how's everything at home?

30:08.530 --> 30:09.690
It's fine.

30:13.650 --> 30:14.690
It's okay.

30:15.410 --> 30:18.530
You know, school, school...
You get to re-sit your exams?

30:19.090 --> 30:20.410
Yeah, yeah. Next week.

30:20.970 --> 30:22.570
Oh, look at you.

30:26.930 --> 30:28.810
The officers told me about your search.

30:30.730 --> 30:33.290
It, it was... They made a mistake.

30:36.570 --> 30:37.850
I'm so sorry.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.250
I'm sorry that you have to go
through that 'cause I'm in here.

30:41.330 --> 30:43.090
I just wanted to see you, Mum. I miss you.

30:43.170 --> 30:45.170
Oh, darling, I miss you, too, so much.

30:45.890 --> 30:48.610
Oh, my baby. It's okay.

30:51.290 --> 30:53.410
Hey, Deb, you know that
they have to tell your dad?

30:54.490 --> 30:57.090
- No way!
- Yeah. It's procedure.

30:57.370 --> 30:59.890
But they didn't find anything!
Can't you do anything?

30:59.970 --> 31:03.330
I know. I'll try to call him
first so I can tell him myself.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.570
- Mum, he's gonna go ballistic!
- Shh, I'll handle it.

31:07.730 --> 31:08.810
I promise.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.130
Hey, Ronnie, I need to use the phone.

31:17.490 --> 31:18.890
Well, you should have got here earlier.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.170
Please? Look, I'll make it up to you.

31:21.250 --> 31:22.850
Hang on, Manda. How?

31:24.290 --> 31:26.770
I don't know. I'll do anything you
want. Just, please, it's urgent.

31:26.850 --> 31:28.490
Just give her your spot, Ronnie.

31:29.130 --> 31:30.450
- Look, I'll call you back, Manda.
- Thanks.

31:30.530 --> 31:33.490
Just get her some choppies and
that. She'll be all right. Love you.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.170
You feeling better?

31:55.370 --> 31:56.890
Yeah. Thanks.

31:57.530 --> 31:59.210
It must be nice to feel human again.

32:00.090 --> 32:02.570
Maybe I can arrange a visit
with Kaiya. Would you like that?

32:05.570 --> 32:07.410
- Yeah.
- I'll see what I can do.

32:09.490 --> 32:10.530
Thank you.

32:11.090 --> 32:14.010
You know, before we can go down that road,

32:17.770 --> 32:21.290
I need to be confident you
won't fall back into old habits.

32:22.930 --> 32:25.690
Now, I need you to tell me
who supplied you the drugs.

32:28.170 --> 32:31.330
Look, Toni, if you don't give me a
name, I can't get you out of here.

32:32.170 --> 32:33.810
So, who supplied you the drugs?

32:34.890 --> 32:36.050
It was the teacher.

32:38.810 --> 32:39.890
Mr. Phelps.

32:41.970 --> 32:43.650
Does anybody else know about this?

32:45.050 --> 32:46.130
No.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.890
You know, falsely accusing a member
of staff is a very serious matter.

32:53.650 --> 32:54.730
It was him.

32:55.450 --> 32:57.090
You're lying, Toni.

33:00.330 --> 33:03.810
And if you repeat that story to
anyone, you will not get out of here,

33:03.930 --> 33:06.930
and you will not see your daughter
again. Do I make myself clear?

33:08.170 --> 33:09.290
Yep.

33:09.530 --> 33:12.530
So, who supplied you the drugs?

33:13.250 --> 33:15.610
No one, miss. I found them.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.370
Right, well, that sounds more likely.

33:27.610 --> 33:29.730
How'd you go? Your emergency.

33:29.850 --> 33:31.530
Yeah, sorted. Thanks.

33:31.970 --> 33:34.410
You seem to be settling in
all right, making friends.

33:34.490 --> 33:35.970
Okay, I've got to go.

33:36.610 --> 33:37.850
23 Cromwell Avenue.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.570
That's where she lives,
doesn't she? Young Debbie.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.690
I knew this girl once.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.770
Mowed down on the pedestrian
crossing right outside the school.

33:49.050 --> 33:51.570
Hit and run. Terrible accident.

33:52.410 --> 33:53.930
Now, that'd be a tragedy.

33:56.290 --> 33:57.490
What do you want?

33:59.850 --> 34:02.330
You're gonna help me teach
Francesca some manners.

34:24.810 --> 34:25.929
Two sugars.

34:37.690 --> 34:39.090
I said you can stay.

34:50.290 --> 34:51.610
Shit day, huh?

34:56.530 --> 34:58.810
- BEA: So, I got to call him before...
- LIZ: Yeah, right!

34:59.650 --> 35:01.650
Right. That's good.

35:02.490 --> 35:04.410
So, will Debbie be allowed to visit again?

35:05.130 --> 35:07.330
Maybe. When Harry calms down.

35:07.650 --> 35:08.970
DOR: It must have been nice to see her.

35:09.290 --> 35:10.490
You'll see Kaiya again.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.010
She's not gonna forget you.

35:12.090 --> 35:13.090
Straight!

35:14.170 --> 35:15.530
Booms, you fluff, I'll fold.

35:15.810 --> 35:16.970
I fluffed yesterday.

35:17.130 --> 35:18.410
Well, you're the best fluffer I know.

35:18.490 --> 35:19.570
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:19.690 --> 35:22.130
Boomer, you were rostered
on in the kitchen.

35:22.570 --> 35:24.370
What, you running the joint
now, are you, Jacqueline?

35:25.010 --> 35:26.610
Hold that thought, Francesca.

35:26.970 --> 35:28.210
You checked the roster, Sue?

35:28.490 --> 35:29.850
No. I just follow Franky.

35:30.610 --> 35:32.410
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh...

35:32.930 --> 35:34.530
Hey, peanut butter.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.570
That's it. That's it. That's nice, Dor.

35:37.690 --> 35:39.530
- Watch it. Watch your finger.
- I am.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.050
- Get the fuck off me!
- Hey! Ronnie!

35:49.330 --> 35:52.850
We haven't got much time, so stop
struggling and let's get this over with.

35:53.250 --> 35:54.450
You're fucking twisted, Jacqueline!

35:54.770 --> 35:57.610
Now, Francesca, I do run
this prison, and nobody,

35:57.690 --> 36:00.210
especially you, challenges
me and gets away with it.

36:04.410 --> 36:05.610
All right, Bea.

36:07.530 --> 36:08.650
Do the honors.

36:10.650 --> 36:11.730
Don't...

36:17.690 --> 36:20.330
Don't make me repeat myself.
I hate repeating myself.

36:30.570 --> 36:32.690
If you'd minded your own business,
Bea wouldn't have to do this.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.570
Can we try and sort this out?

36:34.650 --> 36:36.810
It's just a freakin'
misunderstanding, isn't it, Franky?

36:36.930 --> 36:38.810
Best just sit this one out, Liz.

36:42.730 --> 36:43.770
Do it.

36:56.290 --> 36:57.570
Don't do it, Red.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.610
Go and get Jackson. Quick.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.930
How long have we got to
play this game, Francesca?

37:35.370 --> 37:37.170
Till you realize you're never gonna win?

37:53.170 --> 37:54.890
FRANKY'S MOM: You'd better
be in bed, Francesca!

38:00.890 --> 38:01.930
You hear me?

38:06.930 --> 38:07.970
Who did this to you?

38:11.890 --> 38:13.850
Come on, Franky. You
have to let me help you.

38:18.890 --> 38:20.050
I want my dad.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.290
I didn't think you were gonna do it, Bea.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.050
There you are.

38:29.770 --> 38:30.850
Now, Boomer, stop.

38:31.290 --> 38:32.410
- I'll fucking kill her!
- No, no, no.

38:32.490 --> 38:34.050
- It's not gonna help anyone.
- It'll make me feel better.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.570
This is Franky's problem.

38:35.650 --> 38:36.850
Which makes it mine!

38:37.290 --> 38:39.330
No! No! Let her deal with it.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.250
That's what she'd want.

38:43.290 --> 38:44.450
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.530
It's all right.

38:46.210 --> 38:47.210
Now.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.370
Thanks.

38:56.170 --> 38:58.490
- You shouldn't have done it.
- What was I supposed to do?

38:59.290 --> 39:01.130
Sit tight and hope that Jacs was bluffing?

39:12.490 --> 39:15.290
I got told it was an
accident. Is that true?

39:17.440 --> 39:19.360
Can I get anything for you? Can I, um...

39:21.130 --> 39:22.290
Can I do anything?

39:30.650 --> 39:32.490
I'm so glad you asked them to call me.

39:35.090 --> 39:36.610
You've got to get through this, Franky,

39:37.930 --> 39:39.130
and to hold on.

39:41.650 --> 39:42.890
I'll help you.

40:11.130 --> 40:12.410

40:16.610 --> 40:18.050
I don't want to see you again.

40:21.290 --> 40:22.650
And I want you to stop writing.

You're my kid.

I haven't been your kid in 15 years!

40:52.290 --> 40:53.730
It's not changing now.

Sorry.

41:49.650 --> 41:50.810
Franky.

41:52.690 --> 41:54.090
I didn't want to do that,

41:54.170 --> 41:55.330
but I had no choice, Jacs,

41:55.410 --> 41:56.930
she was threatening my daughter.

I don't give a shit about your family.

in your life, then that's your problem.
