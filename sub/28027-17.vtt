00:31.189 --> 00:34.428
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight"!

00:34.588 --> 00:37.228
I'm John Oliver.
Thank you so much for joining us.

00:37.388 --> 00:39.628
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

00:39.788 --> 00:42.307
which was a big one
for Trump and diplomacy,

00:42.467 --> 00:46.947
two words that go together
like "fire" and "Chicago, 1871."

00:47.107 --> 00:48.466
Trump was overseas this week,

00:48.626 --> 00:50.466
meeting with his favorite
authoritarians.

00:50.626 --> 00:53.106
He joked with Putin about
meddling in U.S. elections,

00:53.266 --> 00:56.065
called Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman
"a friend of mine,"

00:56.225 --> 00:58.265
and just this morning,
popped across the DMZ

00:58.425 --> 01:00.145
<i>to North Korea</i>
<i>with Kim Jong-un,</i>

01:00.305 --> 01:03.904
<i>while seemingly being thrilled</i>
<i>that he'd been invited over.</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:05.424
It's an honor to be with you,

01:05.584 --> 01:07.944
an honor that you asked me
to step over that line,

01:08.104 --> 01:09.783
and I was proud
to step over the line.

01:09.943 --> 01:13.783
I thought you might do that.
I wasn't sure, but I was ready to do it.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.783
And I want to thank you.
It's been great.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.702
Oh, that's actually nice.

01:17.862 --> 01:20.902
So Trump wanted to step over the line,
was ready to do it,

01:21.062 --> 01:23.302
but waited until he received
affirmative consent.

01:23.461 --> 01:25.661
What a refreshing
change of pace for him!

01:25.821 --> 01:28.701
Maybe--maybe Trump's mantra
going forward should be,

01:28.861 --> 01:31.980
"Treat women with the same respect
you show murderous autocrats."

01:32.140 --> 01:33.940
He's growing!
Good for him.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.180
The other big diplomacy news
of the week

01:36.340 --> 01:40.379
concerns Jared Kushner,
Slender Man's weird nephew.

01:40.539 --> 01:44.059
Jared's Middle East peace plan has now
been over two years in the making,

01:44.219 --> 01:47.418
and even before taking office,
Trump was hyping it like this:

01:47.578 --> 01:52.777
If you can't produce peace
in the Middle East, nobody can. Okay?

01:52.937 --> 01:54.737
All my life, I've been hearing

01:54.897 --> 01:57.817
that's the toughest deal
in the world to make,

01:57.977 --> 01:59.536
and I've seen it.

01:59.696 --> 02:02.776
But I have a feeling that Jared
is gonna do a great job.

02:02.936 --> 02:04.576
Of course he is!

02:04.736 --> 02:08.215
Jared's racked up an impressive list
of accomplishments in his 38 years,

02:08.375 --> 02:12.135
from having a "very smooth, shiny face,"
to "end of list."

02:12.295 --> 02:14.734
Well, this week,
Jared announced

02:14.894 --> 02:17.774
his "Peace to Prosperity" plan
during a conference in Bahrain

02:17.934 --> 02:19.774
with a stirring speech.

02:19.934 --> 02:21.933
<i>The Peace to Prosperity vision</i>

02:22.093 --> 02:23.453
<i>is a modern framework</i>

02:23.613 --> 02:26.253
<i>for a brighter</i>
<i>and more prosperous future.</i>

02:26.413 --> 02:29.172
The man is
a once-in-a-generation orator.

02:29.332 --> 02:32.172
He's like Cicero reincarnated
as a garbage disposal.

02:32.332 --> 02:35.371
And look, while that may not be
Jared's real voice,

02:35.531 --> 02:38.251
what he presented this week
is also not a real plan.

02:38.411 --> 02:41.890
It is a "vision" that fits somewhere
between "economic wish list"

02:42.050 --> 02:44.210
and "half-remembered
rich boy wet dream,"

02:44.370 --> 02:45.970
because essentially,

02:46.130 --> 02:47.770
it describes
hypothetical investments

02:47.930 --> 02:51.049
in Palestine and its neighbors
worth more than $50 billion,

02:51.209 --> 02:52.889
once peace is achieved.

02:53.049 --> 02:55.928
But achieving peace
is the really important part.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.848
Without that,
you've got nothing.

02:58.008 --> 03:01.288
Jared punted announcing that part
of the plan until later this year.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.807
The more you listened
to him talk about his vision,

03:03.967 --> 03:06.007
the less he seemed
to actually say.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.727
So how do we begin to make
this change?

03:08.887 --> 03:11.806
We need the right plan,
and to create the right environment.

03:11.966 --> 03:15.926
If we have a real peace, and there's not
a fear of people doing terrorism,

03:16.086 --> 03:18.165
then all of a sudden,
we can thin the borders

03:18.325 --> 03:20.845
and allow for a much faster
flow of goods and people.

03:21.005 --> 03:23.924
After years of thinking,
Jared's arrived at the conclusion

03:24.084 --> 03:25.924
that the Middle East
would be better off

03:26.084 --> 03:28.204
if people stopped
"doing terrorism."

03:28.364 --> 03:31.763
Think about the chain of events
that led him to that moment.

03:31.923 --> 03:34.123
Jared had that idea,
"no doing terrorism,"

03:34.283 --> 03:37.163
and thought, "That's an awesome point.
I'll write that down."

03:37.323 --> 03:38.922
So he did,
and then he went to sleep,

03:39.082 --> 03:40.722
exhausted by the thought.

03:40.882 --> 03:42.962
He woke up,
read what he'd written,

03:43.122 --> 03:45.761
and he was like, "Yup, nailed it.
I'm a good boy!"

03:45.921 --> 03:47.681
Then he said that point,
unembarrassed,

03:47.841 --> 03:50.001
out loud in front
of actual human beings.

03:50.161 --> 03:51.801
Which should be humiliating.

03:51.961 --> 03:54.480
I'm far from the only one
critical of his plan.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.600
Dan Kurtzer, a former
ambassador to Israel,

03:56.760 --> 03:59.399
reportedly said, "I would give
this so-called plan

03:59.559 --> 04:01.919
a C-minus from an undergraduate
student."

04:02.079 --> 04:04.679
Although I doubt
that actually bothers Jared,

04:04.839 --> 04:09.598
'cause a C-minus is
the trust fund boy's A-plus.

04:09.758 --> 04:13.677
And to give you some sense of Jared's
odds of success, I should point out,

04:13.837 --> 04:16.317
no Palestinian officials
attended Jared's conference,

04:16.476 --> 04:18.677
possibly because they don't see
Jared, or Trump,

04:18.837 --> 04:21.875
as neutral mediators,
and why would they?

04:22.036 --> 04:24.116
Jared's family is so close
to Netanyahu,

04:24.276 --> 04:28.795
the prime minister once stayed at their
home and slept in Jared's bedroom,

04:28.955 --> 04:31.595
in what I'd imagine
was Jared's racecar bed,

04:31.755 --> 04:35.594
under a shelf of other kids' soccer
trophies that his dad bought for him.

04:35.754 --> 04:37.194
And it's not just that.

04:37.354 --> 04:40.154
The administration recognized
Jerusalem as Israel's capital

04:40.314 --> 04:43.153
and cut hundreds of millions
in aid to the Palestinians.

04:43.313 --> 04:45.633
When Netanyahu got wind
that Trump would recognize

04:45.793 --> 04:48.952
the Golan Heights as part of Israel,
he responded like this:

04:49.112 --> 04:51.432
Prime Minister Netanyahu
has announced he's naming

04:51.592 --> 04:54.392
a controversial new settlement
in the Golan Heights

04:54.552 --> 04:57.631
<i>after the man he calls his good friend,</i>
<i>Donald Trump.</i>

04:57.791 --> 05:01.831
That must've been the fastest,
easiest decision in Israeli history.

05:01.991 --> 05:03.310
"How should we thank Trump?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.910
"Just slap his name on a sign.
"He'll love it.

05:06.070 --> 05:09.110
"Oh--oh-- oh, shit, the Golan Heights
just went bankrupt.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.709
We probably should've
seen that coming."

05:11.869 --> 05:13.829
But maybe the clearest sign

05:13.989 --> 05:16.029
of how poorly thought-out
Jared's approach is

05:16.189 --> 05:18.028
comes from this
Palestinian olive farmer.

05:18.188 --> 05:20.308
A few years ago,
he proposed a joint venture

05:20.468 --> 05:21.908
between Palestinians
and Israelis,

05:22.068 --> 05:25.547
only to see his project then defunded
by the Trump administration.

05:25.707 --> 05:29.707
And Jared's plan contained
a special surprise just for him.

05:29.867 --> 05:33.906
<i>Junaidi is still bitter at how the</i>
<i>administration treated his project.</i>

05:34.066 --> 05:36.146
<i>So imagine his surprise</i>
<i>when we told him</i>

05:36.306 --> 05:37.906
<i>that his face was being used</i>

05:38.066 --> 05:39.505
<i>in the glossy White House</i>
<i>brochure</i>

05:39.665 --> 05:42.425
<i>promoting Jared Kushner's</i>
<i>peace plan.</i>

05:42.585 --> 05:45.864
Did you know that they're using
your image in these proposals?

05:46.024 --> 05:47.904
The Kushner plan, yeah.

05:48.064 --> 05:49.624
You didn't know
they're using your--

05:49.784 --> 05:51.824
- Your face?
- No.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.143
This is a--
this is the report.

05:54.303 --> 05:56.943
This is the White House
website.

05:58.783 --> 06:00.142
That's you, right?

06:02.782 --> 06:06.062
Wow. You know you're fucking up
your peace process

06:06.222 --> 06:10.901
when you can't even get an actual
olive farmer to extend an olive branch.

06:11.061 --> 06:14.580
But in the end--
in the end, that olive farmer

06:14.740 --> 06:16.660
may have summed up
Jared's proposals

06:16.820 --> 06:18.540
better than anyone else.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.059
Kushner is very bad student.

06:23.219 --> 06:24.739
He don't know nothing.

06:24.899 --> 06:28.538
Exactly! He is right, because if you
didn't know it before this week,

06:28.698 --> 06:32.218
it's now clear that the only way
Jared's getting peace in the Middle East

06:32.378 --> 06:35.097
is if he somehow stumbles upon
a button in the woods

06:35.257 --> 06:37.217
labeled "Middle East
Peace Button."

06:37.377 --> 06:39.657
And even then, there's only
around a 50/50 chance

06:39.817 --> 06:42.017
that he knows enough
to fucking press it.

06:42.176 --> 06:43.856
And now this.

06:48.416 --> 06:52.895
<i>The 20-pound live lobster</i>
<i>patted down by the TSA.</i>

06:53.055 --> 06:55.895
<i>Exclusive: it's his lobster.</i>

06:56.055 --> 06:58.334
<i>So why is he so upset?</i>
<i>And...</i>

06:58.494 --> 07:01.774
When you stuck your fingers
in that alligator's nose,

07:01.934 --> 07:03.254
what did the alligator do?

07:03.413 --> 07:08.293
<i>Plus, the phone sucked</i>
<i>right out of an airplane.</i>

07:08.453 --> 07:10.372
<i>Then, don't hold the mayo.</i>

07:10.532 --> 07:12.812
<i>Can you believe this guy?</i>
<i>Then...</i>

07:14.172 --> 07:16.412
<i>It's Suzy the tiger, and...</i>

07:16.572 --> 07:20.331
<i>back-to-school nose jobs</i>
<i>for twins.</i>

07:20.491 --> 07:22.891
<i>Plus, the bear</i>
<i>that invited himself</i>

07:23.051 --> 07:25.370
<i>to the family barbecue.</i>

07:25.530 --> 07:28.730
<i>And...fear of nuclear war</i>
<i>got you down?</i>

07:28.890 --> 07:31.050
<i>Buy a doomsday bunker.</i>
<i>Then...</i>

07:31.210 --> 07:34.889
Why escalators can be so terrifying
for elderly people.

07:35.049 --> 07:37.889
<i>And food buffet secrets.</i>
<i>Then...</i>

07:38.049 --> 07:39.848
Cough syrup
murder investigation.

07:40.008 --> 07:42.568
<i>And real-life mole people</i>
<i>mystery.</i>

07:42.728 --> 07:44.728
<i>Plus, killer umbrellas.</i>

07:44.888 --> 07:47.367
<i>And...funniest pitch ever?</i>

07:51.247 --> 07:52.886
Moving on.

07:53.046 --> 07:56.846
For our main story tonight,
we're gonna talk about e-commerce.

07:57.006 --> 08:00.765
It's like regular commerce, but no one
calls the police when you do it naked.

08:00.925 --> 08:03.405
The rise of e-commerce
has dramatically changed

08:03.565 --> 08:04.885
the way we shop
for everything,

08:05.045 --> 08:08.364
and its convenience is irresistible,
as this woman admits.

08:08.524 --> 08:10.444
If I don't have to get out
of the house,

08:10.604 --> 08:12.884
why not just
Amazon Prime it?

08:13.044 --> 08:14.883
I know she might sound lazy there,

08:15.043 --> 08:17.123
but you simply can't blame
Ashlyn Aardema.

08:17.283 --> 08:19.203
She's spent her life
at the beginning

08:19.363 --> 08:21.083
of every alphabetical list.

08:21.242 --> 08:23.162
She's never had to wait
for anything!

08:23.322 --> 08:26.682
N through Z, that's the sturdy boy's
half of the alphabet.

08:26.842 --> 08:30.441
That's where you learn the meaning of
the phrase "Hold on a second, John."

08:30.601 --> 08:34.321
She's right. 20 years ago, when you
ran out of something like toilet paper,

08:34.481 --> 08:36.880
you had to pull on your
Juicy Couture velour pants,

08:37.039 --> 08:39.559
Uggs, and Von Dutch hat,
leave your house,

08:39.720 --> 08:41.480
and go to something called
a "store,"

08:41.640 --> 08:43.719
physically locate something
called an "aisle,"

08:43.879 --> 08:46.439
pick the toilet paper up
with your physical arms,

08:46.599 --> 08:50.398
drag yourself to the register using your
legs and feet, pay for it with cash,

08:50.558 --> 08:52.798
and then somehow transport
the toilet paper

08:52.958 --> 08:56.398
all the way back to your house in a bag
even if you were thirsty!

08:56.558 --> 08:58.117
It was hell.

08:58.277 --> 09:01.797
Now, thankfully, you can just click
a button, which is much better.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.517
It's no wonder
that e-commerce

09:03.676 --> 09:06.396
is chipping away at
brick-and-mortar retail sales.

09:06.556 --> 09:09.796
And it can seem like the retail
jobs are shifting too.

09:09.956 --> 09:12.995
The number of workers who lost
their jobs at stores like Sears,

09:13.155 --> 09:14.995
Macy's, and J.C. Penney
since 2000

09:15.155 --> 09:18.074
is about the same
as the 444,000

09:18.234 --> 09:20.234
hired by
the warehousing industry.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.874
It's as if warehouses
are absorbing

09:23.034 --> 09:24.834
America's lost
retail employees,

09:24.993 --> 09:27.193
which initially sounds
kind of nice, doesn't it?

09:27.353 --> 09:29.513
It's like hearing
there's a farm upstate

09:29.673 --> 09:32.872
where Borders, Circuit City,
and Tower Records employees

09:33.032 --> 09:34.792
can run around and be free,

09:34.952 --> 09:37.192
when you always just assumed
that that was a lie,

09:37.352 --> 09:40.071
and that they were all
euthanized.

09:40.231 --> 09:45.871
But what actually happens in warehouses
can be invisible to most people,

09:46.031 --> 09:49.390
unless companies like Amazon
choose to give us entertaining glimpses

09:49.550 --> 09:52.630
into what a fun workplace
they run, like this.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.509
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how Amazon</i>

09:54.669 --> 09:57.389
<i>gets your packages to you</i>
<i>so quickly?</i>

09:57.549 --> 09:58.909
<i>We do it with two things:</i>

09:59.069 --> 10:02.068
<i>amazing technology</i>
<i>and amazing people.</i>

10:02.228 --> 10:03.548
<i>Tell us about yourself, Sean.</i>

10:03.708 --> 10:05.908
I receive products,
and I'm a horrible dancer.

10:06.068 --> 10:07.427
<i>Can we see some moves?</i>

10:10.027 --> 10:11.867
<i>The SLAM machine weighs,</i>
<i>scans your box,</i>

10:12.027 --> 10:14.546
<i>and attaches a label</i>
<i>all in, like, one second.</i>

10:14.706 --> 10:17.186
<i>Oh, and that's Ryan.</i>
<i>He loves photography.</i>

10:17.346 --> 10:18.746
I do love photography.

10:18.906 --> 10:21.865
<i>Finally, Jackie gives every single box</i>
<i>a long and loving hug</i>

10:22.025 --> 10:23.625
<i>before loading it</i>
<i>onto a truck.</i>

10:23.785 --> 10:25.865
-No, I don't.
<i>-Maybe just this one?</i>

10:26.025 --> 10:28.624
-Okay.
<i>-Aww, you love it.</i>

10:28.784 --> 10:30.464
Hold on. Hold on.

10:30.624 --> 10:34.064
Saying "You love it" after coercing her
into hugging a box

10:34.224 --> 10:35.664
is gross.

10:35.823 --> 10:38.023
It's telling that on YouTube-
and this is true-

10:38.183 --> 10:41.143
comments are disabled
for that video.

10:41.303 --> 10:44.742
Presumably because Amazon knew
the only reasonable response to that is,

10:44.902 --> 10:47.342
"Fuck everything about this."

10:47.502 --> 10:50.861
The truth is, those jobs
are not all dance-offs and box hugging.

10:51.021 --> 10:53.861
They are physically hard,
as this commentator says,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.341
albeit in the most tactless way
possible.

10:56.501 --> 10:58.860
But when you go to the
distribution centers--

10:59.020 --> 11:00.580
they call them fulfillment centers,

11:00.740 --> 11:03.060
'cause it's supposed to be fulfilling--
it's not.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.419
It's an amazing thing to see,
but when I--

11:05.579 --> 11:08.139
<i>my first time I visited one</i>
<i>of these massive warehouses</i>

11:08.299 --> 11:12.018
<i>with row after row after row of stuff</i>
<i>and these people walking miles,</i>

11:12.178 --> 11:15.978
<i>tens of miles a day picking these things</i>
<i>and putting them back in there,</i>

11:16.138 --> 11:19.617
<i>it just looks like backbreaking,</i>
<i>exhausting work.</i>

11:19.777 --> 11:22.657
<i>-It made me thank God I went to college.</i>
<i>-That's right.</i>

11:22.817 --> 11:26.616
Wow, joking about people
not going to college

11:26.776 --> 11:28.656
is some concentrated elitism.

11:28.816 --> 11:30.896
Although, to be fair,
it is the condescension

11:31.056 --> 11:33.255
that really pulls his outfit
together.

11:33.415 --> 11:36.615
A lilac plaid shirt
beneath a pastel plaid blazer--

11:36.775 --> 11:38.615
you look like
a Brooks Brothers mannequin

11:38.775 --> 11:41.494
who was thrown out
for being a noise violation.

11:41.654 --> 11:45.214
But the thing is, he is right:
it is backbreaking labor,

11:45.374 --> 11:46.693
sometimes literally.

11:46.853 --> 11:49.333
The injury and illness rate
in the warehouse industry

11:49.493 --> 11:51.853
is higher than industries
like coal mining,

11:52.013 --> 11:53.493
construction, and logging.

11:53.652 --> 11:56.292
I didn't know there were jobs
more dangerous than those,

11:56.452 --> 12:01.451
other than maybe rodeo clown,
Oompa Loompa, or shark dentist.

12:01.611 --> 12:03.811
And now is a good time
to talk about this,

12:03.971 --> 12:06.531
because Amazon just announced
their annual Prime Day,

12:06.691 --> 12:08.210
one of their biggest
sales events--

12:08.370 --> 12:10.850
basically, Black Friday
in the middle of July.

12:11.010 --> 12:12.570
So tonight, let's look

12:12.730 --> 12:14.929
at the warehouse part
of the logistics industry

12:15.089 --> 12:16.809
and the people
who work inside them.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.129
Because the margins
are razor-thin,

12:19.289 --> 12:21.849
and the tiniest details
can make a huge difference.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.368
At Walmart's most recent
shareholder meeting,

12:24.528 --> 12:26.608
their CEO brought
two workers onstage

12:26.768 --> 12:29.607
to show off how a minor change
they'd made to packing trucks

12:29.767 --> 12:32.727
was going to pay off
in a big way for investors.

12:32.887 --> 12:37.486
We had this two-step stool
in the trailers, and guess what?

12:37.646 --> 12:39.126
It's kind of clunky.

12:39.286 --> 12:41.966
It's a little bit big,
and it's a little bit heavy.

12:42.126 --> 12:44.005
So Francisco does this job
every day

12:44.165 --> 12:46.885
and figures out that
if we change to this stool,

12:47.045 --> 12:49.325
which is lighter
and easier to move around,

12:49.485 --> 12:51.764
people will actually use it
all the time,

12:51.924 --> 12:54.564
and we're doing a better job
of cubing out the trailers.

12:54.724 --> 12:57.883
It's gonna save us
at least $30 million this year.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.843
Can you thank these two for us?

13:01.403 --> 13:03.163
Great job.
Great job.

13:03.323 --> 13:05.202
Really appreciate it.

13:07.042 --> 13:08.362
See ya.

13:08.522 --> 13:11.761
Yeah! Give these guys
a warm Walmart thank-you!

13:11.921 --> 13:15.361
Which is a small round of applause,
two hearty claps on the back,

13:15.521 --> 13:19.480
and the request that they get this shit
off the stage and get back to work.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.720
So there is a lot that goes on
behind the scenes at warehouses,

13:22.880 --> 13:24.240
far from customers' eyes,

13:24.400 --> 13:27.159
because many retail giants
subcontract

13:27.319 --> 13:28.799
to lesser-known
outside companies.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.439
Take this warehouse in Memphis.

13:30.599 --> 13:34.198
It shipped phones for Verizon,
but it wasn't run by Verizon.

13:34.358 --> 13:36.678
It was owned and operated
by a company called XPO,

13:36.838 --> 13:38.758
one of the bigger names
in logistics.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.557
And workers there said
conditions could be brutal.

13:41.717 --> 13:44.677
Just last year, they complained
about extreme heat.

13:44.837 --> 13:47.836
<i>The workers said in the complaint,</i>
<i>there's no air conditioning</i>

13:47.996 --> 13:50.836
<i>in most of the metal warehouse</i>
<i>on Citation Drive</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:55.035
<i>and contended inside temperatures</i>
<i>can get dangerous on hot days.</i>

13:55.195 --> 13:56.795
<i>A TOSHA spokesperson said</i>

13:56.955 --> 13:58.955
<i>there's no requirement</i>
<i>for air conditioning</i>

13:59.115 --> 14:00.835
<i>in any Tennessee workplace.</i>

14:00.995 --> 14:03.434
An oven. Now I understand
how a chicken feels

14:03.594 --> 14:05.114
when we put 'em in the oven.

14:05.274 --> 14:08.113
That sounds terrible.
Although I will say,

14:08.273 --> 14:11.793
a chicken shouldn't be feeling anything
when you put it in an oven.

14:11.953 --> 14:14.313
If it does, for the love of God,
check your recipe.

14:14.473 --> 14:16.832
You may have missed
some key steps.

14:16.992 --> 14:19.112
And heat is just the start
here.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.912
"The New York Times" reported
that a woman actually died

14:22.072 --> 14:23.911
of cardiac arrest
at the warehouse.

14:24.071 --> 14:27.631
And a coworker told reporters
she'd witnessed her telling managers

14:27.791 --> 14:30.590
that she was short of breath
and asking for an extra break,

14:30.750 --> 14:32.390
which her supervisor denied.

14:32.550 --> 14:34.150
Not just that--
other workers said

14:34.310 --> 14:36.829
managers then told them
to keep moving boxes

14:36.989 --> 14:38.829
as her body lay on the floor.

14:38.989 --> 14:41.389
Now, legally, here is where
I have to tell you

14:41.549 --> 14:43.708
that XPO takes issue
with "The Times's" story.

14:43.868 --> 14:45.468
They deny
that the worker who died

14:45.628 --> 14:47.548
told her supervisor
she was feeling unwell,

14:47.708 --> 14:49.828
and said
the company did allow workers

14:49.988 --> 14:52.147
to leave for the day
after that worker died.

14:52.307 --> 14:54.467
Although I simply don't know
how that squares

14:54.627 --> 14:57.227
with this actual post
on Facebook from that day,

14:57.387 --> 14:58.906
where an XPO employee wrote,

14:59.066 --> 15:00.826
"They're really trying
to make us work

15:00.986 --> 15:03.786
and this lady's dead body
still in the building."

15:03.946 --> 15:07.945
XPO also insisted to us they conducted
a full, independent investigation

15:08.105 --> 15:10.625
that showed just how wrong
"The Times's" story was.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.104
So we said, "Great!
Can we see the report?"

15:13.264 --> 15:15.144
They said the investigation
had been run

15:15.304 --> 15:17.144
by someone who worked
for Michelle Obama.

15:17.304 --> 15:20.463
And we said, "Great!
Can we see the report?"

15:20.623 --> 15:22.503
And they said no,
because, and I quote,

15:22.663 --> 15:24.223
"There is no written report,"

15:24.383 --> 15:26.102
because it was given to them
verbally.

15:26.262 --> 15:28.822
So which account
should we believe here?

15:28.982 --> 15:31.022
XPO's spoken-word report,

15:31.182 --> 15:34.341
the details of which may disappear
into the wide chasm of history

15:34.501 --> 15:37.461
in the grand tradition
of oral storytelling?

15:37.621 --> 15:40.980
Or this written, contemporaneous account
from someone who was there,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.980
about having to work around
a coworker's dead body?

15:44.140 --> 15:46.820
It's up to you.
The lawyers say it's up to you.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.819
I asked the lawyers, "Can it be
up to me?" And they said no.

15:49.979 --> 15:52.579
And I said, "If it was,
I'd choose the Facebook one."

15:52.739 --> 15:56.258
And they said, "You can't say that."
So I'm not going to.

15:56.418 --> 15:58.258
The point is,

15:58.418 --> 16:03.017
the warehouse industry operates
at a breakneck pace.

16:03.177 --> 16:05.417
At this point, we should
probably turn to Amazon,

16:05.577 --> 16:09.096
because they've increased competitive
pressure across the industry.

16:09.256 --> 16:12.456
As a former executive explains,
they set the bar high.

16:12.616 --> 16:15.256
There is a promise of speed,
which is completely sacred.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.095
When you receive
an email from Amazon

16:17.255 --> 16:19.935
saying the item is on the way
and you'll get it tomorrow,

16:20.095 --> 16:22.255
that promise has to be met,
at any cost.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.094
Wow, "at any cost." It's a little weird
to hear someone

16:26.254 --> 16:29.254
treat my stupid Amazon
purchases with such urgency,

16:29.414 --> 16:31.613
'cause you're not delivering
diphtheria medicine

16:31.773 --> 16:33.693
to a remote Alaskan village
here.

16:33.853 --> 16:36.053
You're delivering
novelty horse head masks

16:36.213 --> 16:39.812
to people who've forgotten they
ordered them till they showed up.

16:39.972 --> 16:42.612
Amazon is not the worst actor
in this industry.

16:42.772 --> 16:45.291
They generally don't subcontract
out their warehouses,

16:45.451 --> 16:49.171
and made headlines last year for raising
workers' base pay to $15 an hour.

16:49.331 --> 16:53.410
But being "not the worst"
is a low, low bar,

16:53.570 --> 16:55.730
and they have
huge influence here.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.210
When Amazon announced
this year

16:57.370 --> 17:00.529
that they'd be making one-day shipping
standard for Prime members,

17:00.689 --> 17:03.209
Walmart immediately hinted
that it would do the same.

17:03.369 --> 17:06.367
Basically, Amazon is
the industry trendsetter.

17:06.528 --> 17:08.608
They're the Michael Jackson
of shipping:

17:08.768 --> 17:10.167
they're the best
at what they do,

17:10.328 --> 17:11.728
everyone tries to imitate them,

17:11.887 --> 17:15.807
and nobody who learns a third thing
about them is happy that they did.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.807
Because the conditions
in their warehouses

17:18.967 --> 17:21.726
are not nearly as fun
as their ads like to suggest.

17:21.886 --> 17:23.566
They can be
physically draining,

17:23.726 --> 17:26.645
as this seasonal worker
in his 70s will tell you.

17:26.805 --> 17:30.805
I had a scanner in my hand,
and the scanner would tell me

17:30.965 --> 17:36.284
to go pick up a box
of Oreo cookies

17:36.444 --> 17:38.804
<i>in the purple section.</i>

17:38.964 --> 17:40.923
<i>I would go there,</i>

17:41.083 --> 17:43.283
<i>and then I'd get another scan,</i>

17:43.443 --> 17:47.922
<i>go pick up some STP oil</i>
<i>in the green section,</i>

17:48.082 --> 17:50.522
<i>which is the opposite side</i>
<i>of the warehouse,</i>

17:50.682 --> 17:52.882
<i>which the warehouse</i>
<i>is two football fields</i>

17:53.042 --> 17:54.801
<i>or three football fields.</i>

17:54.961 --> 18:00.401
So I would end up, on a 10-hour shift,
walking 15 to 17 miles a day.

18:00.561 --> 18:03.960
Yeah, and watching that
might stick in your head

18:04.120 --> 18:05.560
the next time
you're sitting there

18:05.720 --> 18:08.240
ordering next-day delivery
of Oreos.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.359
Do you really need them that fast?
Probably not, right?

18:11.519 --> 18:14.759
How about a 72-pack of Tide Pods?
Again, I'd argue no.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.798
Or this costume that makes your cat
look like a sharpshooter?

18:17.958 --> 18:20.678
Well, here it does get
more complicated, doesn't it?

18:20.838 --> 18:22.518
Your cat could be
a little cowboy.

18:22.678 --> 18:24.237
You could call him
"Butch Catsidy,"

18:24.397 --> 18:26.917
and you might want that
to happen as soon as possible.

18:27.077 --> 18:30.956
It's not an emergency, no,
but it's also not unimportant.

18:31.116 --> 18:33.036
And if you're thinking,
"That sounds tough,

18:33.196 --> 18:35.436
but maybe that job
wasn't for that man,"

18:35.596 --> 18:38.955
you should know, the rate at which
Amazon has workers pick items

18:39.115 --> 18:41.715
can exhaust workers of any age.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.435
<i>Pickers like Steven Abadelli</i>

18:43.595 --> 18:46.274
<i>walk 15 miles or more each day</i>

18:46.434 --> 18:49.794
<i>to retrieve as many</i>
<i>as 200 items an hour.</i>

18:49.954 --> 18:52.273
<i>A handheld device</i>
<i>dictates every move</i>

18:52.433 --> 18:55.513
<i>and counts down tasks</i>
<i>to the second.</i>

18:55.673 --> 18:58.552
It would say, I need to be
in aisle 54, get this item,

18:58.712 --> 19:01.632
and then suddenly,
"You're going to aisle 72,

19:01.792 --> 19:04.352
and you have 10 seconds."

19:04.512 --> 19:06.151
<i>Abadelli struggled</i>
<i>to keep up,</i>

19:06.311 --> 19:09.231
<i>and, like many,</i>
<i>was eventually let go.</i>

19:09.391 --> 19:11.671
I would get out of work,
get home,

19:11.831 --> 19:14.910
and sit on the couch,
and my body would quit on me.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.430
You're a guy
in your early 20s.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.430
-Yeah.
-And you're still wiped out.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.829
I was dead
at the end of the day.

19:21.989 --> 19:24.749
Look, no one should be
in their prime in the morning

19:24.909 --> 19:26.469
and then dead
at the end of the day,

19:26.629 --> 19:28.508
unless they are a mayfly.

19:28.668 --> 19:31.948
And mayflies are just not
spending their one day on Earth

19:32.108 --> 19:33.748
in an Amazon warehouse.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.787
Of course they're not.
They know the precious value of time.

19:36.947 --> 19:40.067
They're spending their day
doing a mountain of cocaine

19:40.227 --> 19:43.426
and fucking!

19:43.586 --> 19:45.146
#LIVEFASTDIEFAST.

19:45.306 --> 19:47.306
#YOLO.

19:47.466 --> 19:48.785
But by many accounts,

19:48.945 --> 19:51.025
Amazon operates
at a relentless pace.

19:51.185 --> 19:54.345
As one YouTuber who's worked
in an Amazon warehouse will tell you,

19:54.505 --> 19:56.184
even when they offer
a rewards system,

19:56.344 --> 19:59.424
the incentives can be
a bit of a slap in the face.

19:59.584 --> 20:00.904
They would be like,

20:01.064 --> 20:05.183
everyone's rates are really, really low,
so we'll have a power hour

20:05.343 --> 20:07.463
where you guys have to push
and push and push

20:07.623 --> 20:10.382
as hard as you can,
and the winner gets a prize

20:10.542 --> 20:13.902
for pushing and pushing
through the pain and all that.

20:14.062 --> 20:17.261
Guess what the damn prize was.

20:17.421 --> 20:19.981
A $10 gift card
to In-N-Out burger!

20:20.141 --> 20:21.901
Yeah!

20:22.061 --> 20:23.980
I get why that was annoying.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.540
You know what's better than
a $10 gift card to In-N-Out burger?

20:27.700 --> 20:31.019
Just $10!
It's like an In-N-Out gift card,

20:31.179 --> 20:34.739
but it can be used for things
that don't come "Animal Style."

20:34.899 --> 20:37.818
Plus, over the years, Amazon has faced
criticism from workers

20:37.978 --> 20:40.938
over their willingness to
accommodate basic human needs,

20:41.098 --> 20:42.578
like using the bathroom.

20:42.738 --> 20:45.777
Seven lawsuits have been filed
against them by pregnant workers,

20:45.937 --> 20:48.137
who say they were refused
longer bathroom breaks

20:48.297 --> 20:50.137
and fewer continuous hours
on their feet.

20:50.297 --> 20:52.376
Now, legally, here is where
I have to tell you

20:52.536 --> 20:53.976
that Amazon says
it's accommodated

20:54.136 --> 20:55.616
thousands
of pregnant associates.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.096
And more generally, they say,

20:57.256 --> 21:00.055
"Associates are allowed to use
the toilet whenever needed."

21:00.215 --> 21:04.015
But that simply doesn't square
with many accounts from workers,

21:04.175 --> 21:06.054
both in news reports and many,

21:06.214 --> 21:09.134
many first-person testimonials
on YouTube.

21:09.294 --> 21:12.654
If you go to the bathroom during your
break, you have to wait in line,

21:12.814 --> 21:15.133
and you won't make
your numbers for that period.

21:15.293 --> 21:16.813
Someone will come and talk to you.

21:16.973 --> 21:18.653
If you're far away
from the bathroom,

21:18.813 --> 21:21.772
it's gonna take you
a long time just to get there,

21:21.932 --> 21:24.092
use it, and get back.

21:24.252 --> 21:26.652
Now your rate has plummeted.

21:26.812 --> 21:29.451
Unless you really, really,
really have to,

21:29.611 --> 21:32.771
just hold it until
you have your lunch break,

21:32.931 --> 21:34.770
because it will mess up
your rate,

21:34.930 --> 21:38.170
and they will find any excuse
to fire you.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.250
And that's just
not a good system

21:40.410 --> 21:42.169
for multiple reasons,
including the fact

21:42.329 --> 21:44.409
that when people spend less
in the bathroom,

21:44.569 --> 21:46.289
they don't shorten
the bathroom part.

21:46.449 --> 21:48.368
They shorten
the hand-washing part.

21:48.528 --> 21:50.568
So the next time
you order something online,

21:50.728 --> 21:54.608
it's probably safe to assume it's been
packed by urine-soaked hands.

21:54.768 --> 21:56.087
And if you're thinking,

21:56.247 --> 21:59.767
it can seem Amazon barely sees their
workers as human, you're not alone.

21:59.927 --> 22:03.686
Just watch this interviewer have
that exact thought in real time.

22:03.846 --> 22:06.606
<i>The number of items</i>
<i>they pick per hour,</i>

22:06.766 --> 22:09.446
<i>the number of steps they take,</i>
<i>it's measured,</i>

22:09.605 --> 22:12.165
and when they're not as
productive as their colleagues,

22:12.325 --> 22:13.645
they're put on alert.

22:13.805 --> 22:17.804
There's a line of other people in these
communities waiting to take jobs.

22:17.964 --> 22:20.204
They're almost like robots,

22:20.364 --> 22:22.764
except they're obviously
human beings.

22:23.923 --> 22:27.843
Yeah, yeah.
I could honestly watch that guy

22:28.003 --> 22:31.762
figure out what things are almost like
for hours.

22:31.922 --> 22:34.962
Giraffes are almost
like horses,

22:35.122 --> 22:38.321
except they're obviously
stretchier.

22:38.481 --> 22:41.241
And Amazon--
Amazon is rolling out

22:41.401 --> 22:43.561
more and more robots
in its warehouses,

22:43.721 --> 22:46.120
increasingly working
side by side with humans,

22:46.280 --> 22:48.960
a relationship
which isn't always seamless.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.400
<i>An automated machine</i>
<i>like this one,</i>

22:51.560 --> 22:53.919
<i>used by Amazon</i>
<i>to move merchandise,</i>

22:54.079 --> 22:57.279
<i>accidentally punctured</i>
<i>a can of bear repellent.</i>

23:01.158 --> 23:04.398
<i>The toxic bear spray got</i>
<i>into the building's air vents.</i>

23:04.558 --> 23:06.198
<i>More than 50 workers</i>
<i>complained</i>

23:06.357 --> 23:07.717
<i>about trouble breathing</i>

23:07.877 --> 23:10.837
<i>and a burning sensation</i>
<i>in their eyes and throats.</i>

23:10.997 --> 23:14.756
Yeah. The workers
were bear-maced by a robot.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.436
Amazon says
they've now changed

23:16.596 --> 23:19.436
how bear repellent is stored,
which is frankly just as well,

23:19.596 --> 23:22.915
because their workers have been
bear-maced more than once!

23:23.075 --> 23:25.235
In 2015,
a Texas fire department

23:25.395 --> 23:27.754
responded to an emergency
caused by a robot

23:27.914 --> 23:29.954
running over a can
of bear repellent.

23:30.114 --> 23:33.154
So in 50 years' time, when humanity
is caught in the crossfire

23:33.314 --> 23:35.753
of the great
bear versus robot war,

23:35.913 --> 23:38.073
remember,
robots fired the first shot,

23:38.233 --> 23:40.793
and they fired twice.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.752
And it's not just exhaustion

23:43.912 --> 23:46.112
or the potential
of being bear-maced.

23:46.272 --> 23:48.751
Reports have found numerous
cases of Amazon workers

23:48.911 --> 23:51.231
suffering from workplace
accidents or injuries,

23:51.391 --> 23:52.751
which isn't even surprising.

23:52.911 --> 23:55.631
Remember, this is
a physically demanding job.

23:55.790 --> 23:57.470
And you might hope
that a labor union

23:57.630 --> 23:59.550
could step in to push
for more protections,

23:59.710 --> 24:02.630
but Amazon has actively
fought against that happening,

24:02.790 --> 24:05.949
even producing a union-busting
training video for managers,

24:06.109 --> 24:08.509
which leaked onto the internet
last fall.

24:08.669 --> 24:12.428
We are not anti-union,
but we are not neutral either.

24:12.588 --> 24:15.468
We will boldly defend our direct
relationship with associates

24:15.628 --> 24:19.227
as best for the associate,
the business, and our shareholders.

24:19.387 --> 24:21.587
We don't believe unions
are in the best interest

24:21.747 --> 24:23.387
of our customers,
our shareholders,

24:23.547 --> 24:25.226
or most importantly,
our associates.

24:25.386 --> 24:27.746
Our business model
is built upon speed,

24:27.906 --> 24:29.946
innovation,
and customer obsession,

24:30.106 --> 24:33.225
things that are generally
not associated with unions.

24:33.385 --> 24:36.225
Yeah, "customer obsession"

24:36.385 --> 24:38.584
is not generally
associated with unions,

24:38.744 --> 24:41.184
'cause it's
a very creepy phrase,

24:41.344 --> 24:44.064
and not one that I want to be associated
with any brand,

24:44.224 --> 24:45.743
much less one
that is so desperate

24:45.903 --> 24:48.743
to put fucking microphones
inside my house!

24:48.903 --> 24:50.703
The more you look at Amazon,

24:50.863 --> 24:53.982
the more you realize that its
convenience comes with a real cost,

24:54.142 --> 24:58.422
because think about it: we used to have
to drive to stores to buy things.

24:58.582 --> 25:02.421
Now those things are brought directly
to us, and they're somehow cheaper.

25:02.581 --> 25:04.941
That didn't just happen
with a clever algorithm.

25:05.101 --> 25:06.780
It happened
by creating a system

25:06.940 --> 25:09.940
that squeezes the people
lowest on the ladder, hard.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.220
And all the while,
the man behind Amazon

25:12.380 --> 25:15.139
is now worth $118 billion,

25:15.299 --> 25:17.539
more than anyone else
in the world.

25:17.699 --> 25:19.979
He is so rich,
he seems to actually think

25:20.139 --> 25:22.218
that this is a reasonable
answer to a question

25:22.378 --> 25:25.098
about what he plans to do
with his personal wealth.

25:25.258 --> 25:27.338
The only way that I can see

25:27.498 --> 25:32.377
to deploy this much
financial resource

25:32.537 --> 25:36.016
is by converting
my Amazon winnings

25:36.176 --> 25:38.376
into space travel.

25:40.136 --> 25:41.736
Okay, so first:

25:41.896 --> 25:44.335
$118 billion
is not anybody's "winnings."

25:44.495 --> 25:46.575
It is a computer error
in capitalism.

25:46.735 --> 25:50.894
But it is true: Bezos is spending
a billion dollars a year

25:51.054 --> 25:54.414
on his personal space-exploration
company, Blue Origin.

25:54.574 --> 25:58.093
I'm not saying that billionaires playing
space games is a Freudian issue.

25:58.253 --> 26:00.893
Anyone can talk about how
rockets look like dicks.

26:01.053 --> 26:05.052
I will just say,
this is his actual rocket,

26:05.212 --> 26:07.092
which looks even more
like a dick

26:07.252 --> 26:08.732
than you expected it to.

26:08.892 --> 26:11.451
It has a head!

26:11.611 --> 26:15.211
And even at
a billion dollars a year,

26:15.371 --> 26:17.730
that's just a drop
in the bucket of a fortune

26:17.890 --> 26:20.210
that Bezos can't seem
to figure out how to spend.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.490
Meanwhile,
some of his employees

26:22.650 --> 26:24.969
seem to be working themselves
to exhaustion.

26:25.129 --> 26:27.529
Amazon has driven
the whole warehouse industry

26:27.689 --> 26:30.009
to move constantly faster
and faster

26:30.169 --> 26:31.728
on already low margins.

26:31.888 --> 26:35.168
And, sure, the fact that it pays
at least $15 an hour is nice.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.528
But raising workers' wages

26:37.688 --> 26:39.687
is only part of the equation
here.

26:39.847 --> 26:41.527
Making sure these jobs
are safe

26:41.687 --> 26:44.007
and that the pace is
sustainable is critical too.

26:44.167 --> 26:45.766
And if Bezos has enough money

26:45.926 --> 26:48.846
to fund his space dicks
in perpetuity,

26:49.006 --> 26:50.726
it isn't a question
of whether he "can"

26:50.886 --> 26:52.925
improve working conditions
for his employees.

26:53.085 --> 26:55.165
It's just a question
of if he wants to.

26:55.325 --> 26:57.805
And if he doesn't want to,
at the very least,

26:57.965 --> 27:00.164
Amazon should present
a more realistic picture

27:00.324 --> 27:02.124
of what their promises
cost the workers

27:02.284 --> 27:03.844
who make it all happen.

27:04.004 --> 27:05.724
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how Amazon</i>

27:05.884 --> 27:07.643
<i>gets your packages to you</i>
<i>so quickly?</i>

27:07.803 --> 27:09.283
<i>We do it with two things:</i>

27:09.443 --> 27:11.643
<i>amazing technology</i>
<i>and amazing people.</i>

27:11.803 --> 27:14.842
<i>Every day, thousands of items arrive</i>
<i>and Sean goes to find them.</i>

27:15.002 --> 27:16.322
<i>Tell us about yourself, Sean.</i>

27:16.482 --> 27:18.882
I pick up products,
and I'm a horrible dancer.

27:19.042 --> 27:20.802
<i>That's fun.</i>
<i>Can we see some moves?</i>

27:20.962 --> 27:23.361
Oh, I've already walked
12 miles today.

27:23.521 --> 27:24.841
<i>I said dance!</i>

27:26.721 --> 27:28.201
Ah, fuck! Shit!

27:28.360 --> 27:29.760
<i>Sick moves!</i>

27:29.920 --> 27:32.880
<i>That's Ryan. He moves items</i>
<i>around the fulfillment center.</i>

27:33.040 --> 27:34.800
I don't have time to go
to the bathroom,

27:34.960 --> 27:36.399
so I'll stand here
and wet myself.

27:36.559 --> 27:38.319
<i>-Good for you, Ryan.</i>
-All right.

27:39.599 --> 27:41.479
-Can't do it while you watch.
<i>-Okay.</i>

27:41.639 --> 27:43.678
-Okay.
<i>-All right.</i>

27:43.838 --> 27:46.438
All right. Seriously.

27:46.638 --> 27:49.278
<i>Lisa here packs your stuff</i>
<i>into boxes, don't you, Lisa?</i>

27:49.438 --> 27:51.877
Can't talk, I'm running behind
on my units per hour.

27:52.037 --> 27:54.797
<i>It's okay. Just tell us a little bit</i>
<i>about yourself, Lis.</i>

27:54.957 --> 27:59.236
I'm a mom. Got two kids. I don't see
them as much as I like, but--

27:59.396 --> 28:03.436
<i>Nobody cares about your kids, Lisa.</i>
<i>You're falling behind! Faster!</i>

28:03.596 --> 28:05.435
-Oh, fuck you.
<i>-No, fuck you!</i>

28:05.595 --> 28:07.675
<i>The SLAM machine weighs,</i>
<i>scans your box,</i>

28:07.835 --> 28:10.275
<i>and attaches a label</i>
<i>all in, like, one second.</i>

28:10.435 --> 28:13.074
<i>-And this is Alberto.</i>
-My friends call me Al.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.674
And I got to say, I think a union
would help address

28:15.834 --> 28:17.234
some of the systemic problems--

28:17.394 --> 28:19.153
<i>-Oh! Bear spray!</i>
-Jesus Christ!

28:19.313 --> 28:21.753
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>Jackie hugs every box.</i>

28:21.913 --> 28:23.233
-No, I don't.
<i>-Aww.</i>

28:23.393 --> 28:25.072
<i>-Maybe just this one?</i>
-Okay.

28:25.232 --> 28:27.992
<i>-Because a lot of people want this job.</i>
-Okay.

28:28.152 --> 28:30.112
<i>One day,</i>
<i>a robot will hug boxes,</i>

28:30.272 --> 28:31.832
<i>and we'll be done</i>
<i>with this charade.</i>

28:31.991 --> 28:35.831
-Yeah, I get it.
<i>-But until then, hug the box, Jackie.</i>

28:35.991 --> 28:39.870
-Okay...
<i>-Good. Now kiss it.</i>

28:40.030 --> 28:42.390
-I don't want to.
<i>-I said, kiss the box.</i>

28:42.550 --> 28:44.750
<i>Every day, hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of packages</i>

28:44.910 --> 28:46.269
<i>are shipped</i>
<i>to your front door,</i>

28:46.429 --> 28:48.709
<i>and that's all because</i>
<i>of our amazing associates.</i>

28:48.869 --> 28:51.509
<i>-Happy Prime Day, everyone.</i>
-Happy Prime Day.

28:51.669 --> 28:53.149
<i>Bear spray!</i>

28:55.468 --> 28:56.828
Hey, what's up, Sean?

28:56.988 --> 28:58.868
<i>Amazon.</i>
<i>Try not to think about it.</i>

28:59.788 --> 29:01.507
That's our show.
Thanks for watching!

29:01.667 --> 29:05.107
We're off next week,
back July 28th. Good night!
