00:46.538 --> 00:51.579
<i>Before man, before moon, before history,</i>

00:52.562 --> 00:57.472
<i>In a world made of magic and mystery,</i>

00:58.252 --> 01:01.534
<i>Gods and Titans, lightning and bone,</i>

01:02.222 --> 01:05.357
<i>Fought to possess the Chronos stone.</i>

01:05.358 --> 01:11.000
<i>For he who held the stone held the world,</i>

01:11.431 --> 01:16.223
<i>And into darkest earth the Titans were hurled.</i>

01:17.078 --> 01:21.838
<i>And Zeus, the thunder in his throne,</i>

01:23.141 --> 01:28.869
<i>Zeus became the ruler of them all.</i>

01:34.624 --> 01:36.894
<i>Come with me,</i>

01:37.348 --> 01:40.728
<i>across the sea of time.</i>

01:41.867 --> 01:44.552
<i>Come with me,</i>

01:44.554 --> 01:47.862
<i>across the sea of time,</i>

01:49.517 --> 01:52.959
<i>Where creatures never seen before,</i>

01:53.210 --> 01:56.414
<i>The Gorgon and the Manticore,</i>

01:57.000 --> 02:01.093
<i>The Centaur 'neath the silver tree,</i>

02:01.465 --> 02:04.687
<i>Across the sea of time.</i>

02:10.699 --> 02:17.536
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time.</i>

02:17.857 --> 02:24.162
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time,</i>

02:25.656 --> 02:29.197
<i>Where man and god meet in the dawn,</i>

02:29.199 --> 02:32.768
<i>Where gods are kings and men are pawns,</i>

02:32.770 --> 02:36.940
<i>And no man born is truly free,</i>

02:36.942 --> 02:40.784
<i>Across the sea of time.</i>

02:43.333 --> 02:49.287
<i>Zeus descended from the sky,
The lightning by his side,</i>

02:50.402 --> 02:56.895
<i>Love like thunder in his heart,
To take a mortal bride.</i>

02:57.205 --> 03:04.230
<i>And from their union came a son,
Half human and half god,</i>

03:04.232 --> 03:09.381
<i>With twice the strength of mortal men,
To walk…</i>

03:09.893 --> 03:14.124
<i>…where heroes trod.</i>

03:23.100 --> 03:29.380
<i>Come with me, across the sea of time,</i>

03:30.815 --> 03:34.395
<i>When men have fallen to their knees,</i>

03:34.395 --> 03:38.005
<i>And all the gods ignore their pleas,</i>

03:38.005 --> 03:42.153
<i>The name they call is Hercules,</i>

03:42.688 --> 03:46.684
<i>Across the sea of time,</i>

03:49.561 --> 03:53.813
<i>Across the sea of time,</i>

03:53.813 --> 04:00.548
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

04:00.879 --> 04:07.654
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

04:07.654 --> 04:15.023
<i>- Time.
- Hercules.
- Across the sea of time.</i>

06:59.400 --> 07:01.700
Hmm, must've been something he ate.

07:03.155 --> 07:08.820
- Thank you, Hercules!
- Hooray for Hercules!
- Ha-ha-ha!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.539
Destroyed the monster!

07:11.750 --> 07:14.488
Huh! Thank you. Wow, that was fantastic!

07:15.309 --> 07:16.752
Nice job with the monster.

07:17.362 --> 07:18.285
No sweat.

07:19.223 --> 07:20.576
Where were you, anyway?

07:20.961 --> 07:22.564
Hey, I got here as soon as I could.

07:22.564 --> 07:25.589
I would've jumped in, but, well, you
looked like you were doin' okay.

07:26.430 --> 07:27.365
Thanks, buddy.

07:27.587 --> 07:30.289
Hercules, Hercules! Do ya like fish?

07:31.491 --> 07:32.566
Well, sure I…

07:37.800 --> 07:41.899
And there's plenty more where that came from.
Free fish any time you want.

07:42.123 --> 07:43.955
A lifetime supply.

07:44.562 --> 07:48.092
Thanks, but I think this is a lifetime supply.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.874
Come back anytime, Hercules. You're the best.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.520
"Oh, Hercules, you're the best! How can we ever
repay you?! What can we ever…"

07:59.800 --> 08:00.237
Here…

08:00.692 --> 08:01.695
…have a fish.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.601
More fools to rob!

08:33.025 --> 08:35.765
Monsters, highwaymen. What's next? Satyrs?

08:41.335 --> 08:42.246
Nice place, huh?

08:43.868 --> 08:44.803
Yo, baby!

08:46.781 --> 08:48.350
You talkin' to me?

08:52.407 --> 08:55.910
Why don't you and your little friend
give yourselves a thrill?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.873
Thanks, don't mind if we do.

09:01.588 --> 09:02.572
Come on, Gabrielle.

09:03.144 --> 09:04.687
You guys asked for it.

09:05.658 --> 09:09.203
We've, uh, had our eyes on you for,
uh, quite some time.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.415
I've had my eyes on you, too.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.068
Ya have, huh?

09:17.400 --> 09:23.018
Who wouldn't notice such handsome, distinguished
satyrs with such a large bag of gold?

09:28.179 --> 09:29.558
Knock it off, hair-ball!

09:31.500 --> 09:35.216
This gold, it didn't, by any chance, come from…

09:35.216 --> 09:39.432
the purses of innocent travelers
on the road to Corinth, did it?

09:40.659 --> 09:42.020
What if it did?

09:42.398 --> 09:45.019
Hmm. Well, if it did, I'd just have to…

09:47.001 --> 09:48.344
…take it back.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.694
Hey, give me that. It's ours.

09:50.694 --> 09:52.210
Sorry, I don't think so.

09:54.347 --> 09:57.054
You can't just walk in here and take our gold.

09:59.276 --> 10:02.111
You're welcome to try and stop me, goat-breath.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.153
Bravo!

10:32.662 --> 10:33.554
Ares.

10:33.985 --> 10:36.749
Ah, Xena, I love watching you work.

10:37.380 --> 10:43.544
Thanks, but the mighty God of War doesn't come
down from Mount Olympus to a dive like this just
to see the floor show.

10:45.268 --> 10:46.667
You know me too well.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.008
That's for sure.

10:48.326 --> 10:50.623
Actually, there is something you can do for me.

10:50.995 --> 10:52.964
And, as usual, my answer is "No".

10:53.884 --> 10:57.000
It concerns your… friend, Hercules.

10:57.001 --> 11:00.122
My "friend"? Don't you mean your brother?

11:00.124 --> 11:03.608
Half-brother. I just thought you should know…

11:04.204 --> 11:05.849
…he's in grave danger.

11:05.849 --> 11:07.253
He's on his way to Thebes.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.993
Isn't that where his mother lives?

11:09.370 --> 11:10.270
Yes…

11:10.622 --> 11:15.638
…but he must never get there. He's walking right
into a trap. Only you can stop him.

11:24.553 --> 11:27.373
Why should you care what happens to Hercules?

11:28.100 --> 11:31.268
You know what they say, blood is thicker than nectar.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.935
I don't believe you.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.100
This is one of your tricks.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.760
Xena! Frankly, I'm offended.

11:39.849 --> 11:45.042
You gods sit up there on Mount Olympus and
think you can play with us mortals like we were
toys!

11:45.296 --> 11:46.712
Well, I'm no toy.

11:47.359 --> 11:48.348
Ya got that?

11:51.525 --> 11:53.212
It was… it was nice talkin' to you.

11:53.766 --> 11:54.498
We've gotta go.

11:56.537 --> 11:58.967
Don't you think that he might've been telling the
truth for a change?

12:02.141 --> 12:02.840
Sorry.

12:03.288 --> 12:07.926
Ares has tried everything to draw me back into
his world of destruction.

12:07.926 --> 12:09.505
He's threatened me,

12:10.601 --> 12:11.622
tempted me,

12:12.500 --> 12:14.600
framed me for a crime I didn't commit.

12:15.190 --> 12:17.845
So, now he's trying the sincere approach.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.275
If Ares doesn't want Hercules to 
go up to Thebes,

12:22.536 --> 12:25.252
then it's probably the best place 
for Hercules to be.

12:32.082 --> 12:33.003
This is hot work!

12:36.332 --> 12:39.592
What are you complaining about? I'm the horse.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.673
I'm so hungry, I could eat that rotten fish.

12:43.565 --> 12:46.781
Don't worry. When we're through, mother 
will fix us one of her special…

12:53.082 --> 12:54.577
What is it? What's wrong?

13:19.253 --> 13:20.212
Zeus!

13:27.721 --> 13:29.004
Mother! Look out!

13:33.668 --> 13:34.498
Mother!

14:02.663 --> 14:03.262
No!

14:27.094 --> 14:29.544
Mother!

14:34.890 --> 14:36.708
Hercules! Calm down!

14:37.001 --> 14:39.963
How can I calm down when Zeus has kidnapped
my mother?!

14:40.004 --> 14:43.242
Well are you, are you sure he kidnapped her?

14:43.252 --> 14:46.630
Are you crazy? You saw it!

14:46.630 --> 14:48.703
Yeah, but, well,…

14:48.703 --> 14:51.387
she didn't look like she was putting
up much of a fight.

14:53.248 --> 14:55.005
What do you mean by that?!

14:55.216 --> 14:56.630
Nothing! I…

14:56.630 --> 15:00.100
look, I know how you feel about Zeus,
but, I mean,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.828
after all, he is your father.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.859
Don't remind me!

15:08.581 --> 15:09.319
Sorry.

15:10.008 --> 15:11.084
Where are you going now?

15:11.843 --> 15:12.834
To bring her back.

15:13.404 --> 15:17.032
You…you mean you're…you're…you're going 
to…to Mount Olympus?

15:17.107 --> 15:19.704
That's right. And don't try to stop me.

15:20.339 --> 15:22.285
Are you kidding?! I'm comin' with ya!

15:25.047 --> 15:28.329
Wow, Mount Olympus, the home of the gods.

15:28.983 --> 15:30.612
How come you don't go there more often?

15:30.612 --> 15:33.653
I mean, I know you hate that side of 
your family, but,

15:34.280 --> 15:36.558
after all, Mount Olympus,

15:36.558 --> 15:38.364
it's gotta be fabulous.

15:40.026 --> 15:40.761
Whoa! What the…

15:41.015 --> 15:42.206
Oh, boys!

15:44.114 --> 15:46.174
Geronimo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

15:58.372 --> 16:00.480
Hey, bro. Iolaus.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.880
Hello, Aphrodite.

16:02.210 --> 16:02.897
Wow!

16:04.064 --> 16:07.011
Did you see that three-sixty?
Not too shabby, huh?

16:09.180 --> 16:10.232
Yeah, it was great.

16:10.232 --> 16:13.932
Listen, I don't really have time
to stand around discussing shell technique?

16:17.893 --> 16:21.477
Uh, better close that thing, Iolaus. You're 
tongue's getting all dusty.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.472
Hey, Hercules, hang on.

16:27.003 --> 16:29.050
Look, I know you're bummed about your mom.

16:29.509 --> 16:31.949
What do you care? I mean, she's not your mother.

16:32.338 --> 16:38.068
Look, you may think you're mad about Zeus taking
Alcmene, but you've got nothing on Hera.

16:44.197 --> 16:47.574
How dare he bring that floozy up here?

16:47.574 --> 16:49.736
Who does
he think he is? That…

16:50.325 --> 16:51.489
that…

17:12.339 --> 17:14.019
All I asked you to do…

17:14.019 --> 17:17.580
…was stop Hercules from being there when I
went to get his mother.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.320
A rather simple request,
I would've thought.

17:21.766 --> 17:25.838
Yes, Father. See I asked this mortal 
to help me, but I

17:25.998 --> 17:27.711
You asked a mortal to help you?!

17:28.606 --> 17:29.569
Who, may I ask?

17:30.659 --> 17:31.596
Xena.

17:32.132 --> 17:36.334
Xena? You'll use any excuse to get close 
to her, won't you?

17:37.014 --> 17:42.545
Father, you of all gods, must understand that,
well, some mortal women can just…

17:42.545 --> 17:43.341
Enough!

17:45.882 --> 17:49.539
I doubt that there's anything you can tell
your father about mortal women.

17:50.180 --> 17:51.099
Leave us.

17:56.686 --> 18:00.877
It is well for a mother to know where the 
loyalties of her children lie.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.086
I guess he told you.

18:08.065 --> 18:09.183
Shut up, Artemis.

18:10.939 --> 18:12.436
What is it with you and that Xena?

18:12.936 --> 18:13.967
She brings you
nothing but trouble.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.486
One of these days, Xena will come through for
me.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.967
Just you wait and see.

18:18.744 --> 18:20.398
You should live so long!

18:20.398 --> 18:22.320
Get it? You're an immortal?

18:22.320 --> 18:24.578
How could you do it?

18:25.970 --> 18:30.556
How could you bring a mortal
to this sacred place, especially that mortal?

18:30.556 --> 18:33.265
I don't see that this is any of your concern.

18:33.565 --> 18:34.993
Where is she?

18:35.087 --> 18:38.408
Where did you put her? In the
servants' quarters?

18:38.408 --> 18:41.617
Some plush chamber of her
very own?

18:42.786 --> 18:45.790
Or perhaps the trophy room?

18:46.083 --> 18:46.740
Enough!

18:46.740 --> 18:49.133
Remember to whom you are speaking!

18:49.134 --> 18:51.371
I am Zeus, King of the Gods!

18:53.033 --> 18:54.703
King of the Gods!

18:56.599 --> 18:58.559
But for how long?

19:27.553 --> 19:29.273
Come on, Hercules you heard her!

19:29.543 --> 19:32.067
It's crazy to go
up there if Hera's on the warpath!

19:32.450 --> 19:34.154
You know how
much she hates you!

19:35.014 --> 19:36.709
Iolaus, it's very simple.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.126
My mother's there, and I
have to get her back.

19:39.717 --> 19:41.635
You don't have to come if
you don't want to.

19:45.009 --> 19:45.490
True.

19:46.356 --> 19:49.296
I could just, uh, hang out down
here with you,

19:49.296 --> 19:50.935
keep you from getting lonely.

19:52.376 --> 19:53.484
As if!

19:54.812 --> 19:57.341
Be good, Iolaus. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

19:58.336 --> 20:00.274
Ah, that's no fun. She's your sister.

20:03.475 --> 20:08.118
So, Aphrodite, looks like it's just you and me.

20:11.452 --> 20:15.965
Ah, you mortals might have to put up with these
natural disasters, but I don't.

20:15.965 --> 20:16.929
Toodles!

21:07.453 --> 21:09.158
The Chronos stone.

21:30.888 --> 21:32.372
Hang on! I'll get you!

21:34.884 --> 21:36.675
Hercules! It's closing!

21:48.128 --> 21:49.688
Gabrielle! Look out!

21:53.272 --> 21:54.393
Thanks.

21:56.002 --> 21:57.481
Look at them.

21:59.070 --> 22:02.348
Nothin' like a natural disaster to
bring out the bad guys.

22:03.306 --> 22:04.162
Come on.

22:09.064 --> 22:11.877
I think that belongs to the nice lady.

22:31.453 --> 22:33.075
Back off, low… lives.

22:33.124 --> 22:33.888
Make us.

22:33.488 --> 22:35.532
If I must.

22:50.137 --> 22:51.697
Xena! Look out!

22:56.306 --> 22:57.951
Hang on, kid. I'll getcha.

23:06.090 --> 23:07.508
Gabrielle! Look out!

23:15.445 --> 23:16.344
Get outta my way!

23:21.579 --> 23:22.528
Take that!

23:55.320 --> 23:56.305
Help!

24:15.051 --> 24:15.870
Gotcha!

24:23.990 --> 24:24.976
Good work, Iolaus.

24:53.939 --> 24:58.171
Let me pass in peace, little man.

24:58.999 --> 25:05.404
My quarrel is not with mortals,
but with the gods who imprisoned
me beneath the earth.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.185
If I let you pass,

25:08.185 --> 25:11.688
do you pledge to leave the mortal world alone, 
and take your fight to Mount Olympus?

25:28.632 --> 25:30.952
You have my word.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.640
Go.

25:45.565 --> 25:46.861
Who's Mr. Big?

25:47.932 --> 25:49.612
His name is Porphyrion.

25:50.063 --> 25:51.110
He's a Titan.

25:51.904 --> 25:53.375
A Titan?!

27:22.619 --> 27:23.872
Hello.

27:41.591 --> 27:43.616
No more stealing…

27:43.616 --> 27:46.601
…or you'll wish he had squashed
you like a bug.

27:47.054 --> 27:48.934
Y…yes, ma'am.

27:50.078 --> 27:51.570
Xena, look!

28:05.150 --> 28:08.095
The ancient prophecy has come true at last.

28:08.095 --> 28:10.909
The Titans have escaped from
their prison in Tartarus.

28:10.909 --> 28:13.465
Do you, do you think they'll come here?

28:13.632 --> 28:16.137
Of course, they'll come here. They want revenge.

28:16.137 --> 28:19.477
But we will beat them, right?
I mean this prophecy,

28:19.477 --> 28:21.583
it does say we win in the end.

28:21.683 --> 28:24.047
The source of our power is the Chronos stone,

28:24.047 --> 28:26.018
which we won from them many years ago

28:26.865 --> 28:28.699
and with which we could easily defeat 
them again.

28:28.699 --> 28:32.148
But, as you can see, the Chronos stone is gone.

28:33.802 --> 28:35.901
That evens the odds considerably.

28:37.244 --> 28:38.887
Should be quite a battle.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.108
A bit soon to celebrate, isn't it?

28:43.060 --> 28:45.304
Ya haven't even
met the Titans, yet.

28:45.677 --> 28:46.260
Hera!

28:48.755 --> 28:51.227
Where's the Chronos stone? What have
you done with it?

28:51.695 --> 28:52.908
Why suspect me?

28:53.608 --> 28:58.138
Perhaps your mortal took it. You
can't trust them, you know.

28:59.299 --> 29:05.539
What a predicament! The Titans are coming, 
and no Chronos stone to protect you.

29:07.674 --> 29:14.552
I have it! A champion of mortal blood
can defend you from the big, bad Titans.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.772
Doesn't the prophecy say that?

29:19.388 --> 29:25.099
You could ask your son, Hercules, to help you, 
if you hadn't just kidnapped his mother.

29:39.512 --> 29:40.833
Thank you, Hercules.

29:44.564 --> 29:47.014
There, everything seems to be under control, here.

29:47.014 --> 29:48.367
I'd better get going.

30:05.589 --> 30:06.706
Thanks, bro.

30:07.529 --> 30:09.447
I think you're losing your technique.

30:10.644 --> 30:16.321
Hercules, I know you're mad at Zeus and all, but
you gotta help us! The Titans are coming!

30:16.842 --> 30:18.773
I know. I met one of them.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.103
You let him go?!

30:20.732 --> 30:24.039
But you gotta stop 'em down here,
before they reach Mount Olympus!

30:24.039 --> 30:26.560
Come on, be
our champion, please?

30:28.528 --> 30:31.962
Sorry, if I fought the Titans here, 
innocent people might get hurt.

30:32.585 --> 30:35.424
Besides. I'm not sure I'm on your side.

30:36.493 --> 30:37.414
Great.

30:38.082 --> 30:39.329
Thanks for nothin'.

30:42.716 --> 30:43.847
So that's it?

30:43.847 --> 30:45.424
You're just gonna let the gods down?

30:46.349 --> 30:48.322
They'll find their champion.

30:50.042 --> 30:52.246
That's right. You're not the only hero on Earth.

30:57.462 --> 30:59.445
Is there nothing that Xena can't do?

31:00.028 --> 31:01.639
What're you doing here?

31:02.043 --> 31:04.700
I came to laugh at you. Don't you ever learn?

31:05.443 --> 31:07.275
Ya have to admit, she's perfect for the job.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.903
Yeah, but, she'll never do it.

31:09.904 --> 31:11.490
If I explain to her what's at stake…

31:11.490 --> 31:13.621
She'll think you're lying to her like you always do.

31:13.621 --> 31:16.060
She'll denounce the gods like she always does.

31:16.060 --> 31:19.869
She might even kick your butt while she's 
at it. Should be fun to watch.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.250
Yeah, you're right.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.585
Here, I'll show you how to deal with a mortal.

31:41.655 --> 31:42.581
How many more?

31:43.884 --> 31:45.013
Quite a few.

31:45.984 --> 31:48.563
Word of your healing has gotten around.

31:51.070 --> 31:51.934
Gabrielle?

31:52.355 --> 31:53.637
Are you all right?

31:55.743 --> 31:56.538
Of course,

32:04.692 --> 32:06.130
No-o-o-o-o-o-o!

32:17.949 --> 32:18.939
Gabrielle!

32:25.027 --> 32:25.525
Sorcery!

32:25.525 --> 32:26.396
Now, what?

32:27.778 --> 32:28.638
We wait.

32:46.612 --> 32:50.322
This is the hour of our rebirth!

32:53.434 --> 33:00.152
And we shall take
our vengeance on the gods of Olympus who
imprisoned us so long ago.

33:08.256 --> 33:12.491
We'll blow 'em away, won't we, Mnemosyne?

33:17.924 --> 33:22.213
We'll make them burn!

33:31.792 --> 33:33.241
Cool off, you two.

33:40.003 --> 33:45.714
I have waited too many years, in the
bowels of the Earth, to waste time now.

33:45.714 --> 33:47.564
What is our plan?

33:47.564 --> 33:54.162
Simple, we will attack Mount Olympus, regain
the sacred stone of our father, Chronos,

33:54.162 --> 33:56.139
and rule the universe!

34:06.198 --> 34:08.389
Is this the stone you seek?

34:18.520 --> 34:19.565
Stand back.

34:22.668 --> 34:25.565
While I have the stone, you are in my power.

34:25.565 --> 34:28.839
Understand? You work for me.

34:32.663 --> 34:36.646
Don't fret. You
shall rule the universe,

34:36.646 --> 34:38.920
under my command.

34:43.931 --> 34:45.010
Gabrielle.

34:46.496 --> 34:47.552
I'm so sorry.

34:47.552 --> 34:49.368
This is the work of the gods.

34:49.868 --> 34:51.422
It's aimed at me, not you.

34:56.447 --> 34:58.530
If only I knew you could understand.

35:12.690 --> 35:15.174
I'll make thinks right, Gabrielle, I promise.

35:34.889 --> 35:36.122
Hey, calm down.

35:37.055 --> 35:39.019
You can do it, I know you can.

35:43.956 --> 35:45.510
Come on, Gabrielle, go for it.

35:53.258 --> 35:56.476
I'm starting to think this wasn't such a good
idea-a-a-a-a-a!

36:04.114 --> 36:05.977
Fly, Gabrielle, fly!

36:16.753 --> 36:18.236
Yes! Ya did it!

36:51.861 --> 36:54.803
Huh?! Aphrodite, why aren't you ready
for battle?

36:55.574 --> 36:59.350
I'm sending out a calming aura to neutralize the
bad Titan vibes.

36:59.350 --> 37:03.125
And if that doesn't work, I plan to
hide in my shell.

37:05.421 --> 37:06.874
Shh. What's that?

37:25.639 --> 37:31.086
Of all the tricks you've ever played on mortals this
was the lowest.

37:31.868 --> 37:34.494
It wasn't me. She did it.

37:35.482 --> 37:38.198
Just because I refuse to help in this plot against Hercules…

37:38.351 --> 37:39.833
This has nothing to do with Hercules.

37:43.752 --> 37:45.168
It's the Titans.

37:46.542 --> 37:51.211
If you help us defeat them, I'll turn
your friend back into a human.

38:01.371 --> 38:05.334
And next time, try asking first.

38:14.319 --> 38:15.369
Ya hanging in there?

38:15.369 --> 38:20.303
Yeah, but I can see why the gods aren't bothered
by pesky drop-in guests!

38:21.313 --> 38:23.942
Whoa! Not another Earthquake!

38:27.978 --> 38:29.223
It's the Titans.

40:18.630 --> 40:19.887
Gabrielle!

41:30.782 --> 41:31.866
Thanks.

41:36.004 --> 41:37.464
You're not really welcome.

41:52.459 --> 41:54.896
This is gonna be harder than I thought.

42:11.716 --> 42:14.564
Oh, baby, that's what I like.

42:35.423 --> 42:38.366
Hercules. It's about time.

42:44.305 --> 42:45.865
Looks like the party started without me.

42:54.396 --> 42:56.216
Unfortunately, I can't stay.

43:01.695 --> 43:02.754
But… but…

43:04.729 --> 43:05.687
Aphrodite!

43:12.919 --> 43:17.595
I'm going to crush your skull like an egg.

43:18.283 --> 43:19.855
Sorry, no time.

44:37.170 --> 44:39.362
I never thought I'd see you help
me out of a tangle.

44:39.422 --> 44:41.340
Looks like you're havin' a bad hair day.

44:47.353 --> 44:48.292
Mother!

45:26.573 --> 45:28.429
I have no fight with you.

45:29.043 --> 45:31.100
You let me go in peace.

45:31.642 --> 45:33.412
I return the favour.

45:44.851 --> 45:45.774
Hercules!

45:46.474 --> 45:49.069
Iolaus, I have to get my mother to safety.

45:50.782 --> 45:52.760
Go ahead! I'm gonna stay and fight!

45:53.991 --> 45:55.545
Not me. I'm outta here.

46:06.985 --> 46:07.981
No! Let me go!

46:37.250 --> 46:38.829
Come back, you cowards!

46:38.990 --> 46:43.201
Run, my family, like the frightened 
little animals you are.

46:44.636 --> 46:49.196
Yes, like frightened little animals.

46:58.513 --> 47:02.967
You have chosen the wrong side on which to
fight today.

47:02.967 --> 47:05.678
It ain't over 'til it's over, big boy.

47:23.750 --> 47:27.226
You mean to tell me, you didn't even lift a finger
to help?

47:28.009 --> 47:32.579
I…I…look… I…I climbed Mount Olympus.
I…I rescued you from Zeus.

47:32.579 --> 47:33.679
What do you want from me?

47:33.792 --> 47:36.281
Did you ever think to ask if I wanted to be rescued?

47:42.521 --> 47:45.002
Open up! It's me, Zeus!

47:47.663 --> 47:49.686
Where… where are you?

47:49.874 --> 47:51.145
Down here!

47:52.195 --> 47:54.911
Zeus, what happened to you?

47:56.034 --> 47:57.051
Hera.

48:05.232 --> 48:06.320
Hey, lady!

48:07.468 --> 48:08.212
Lemme in!

48:10.361 --> 48:11.203
Ares?

48:13.110 --> 48:17.574
Just watchit. Don't make me ma-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-d.

48:22.035 --> 48:23.867
Uh, I think I'm allergic to rabbit fur.

48:23.928 --> 48:25.838
Mo-o-o-o-o-ove!

48:29.860 --> 48:32.508
Uh, this is so gross.

48:32.508 --> 48:36.837
I don't even eat red meat
and now I am red meat.

48:40.591 --> 48:43.638
What are you laughing at?!
This is all your fault!

48:44.914 --> 48:47.242
Yeah, why didn't you pitch in up there?

48:47.831 --> 48:51.406
Now the Titans rule the universe. Who knows
what misery they'll cause.

48:53.602 --> 48:56.874
They couldn't do much worse than you have, now,
could they?

49:09.363 --> 49:11.286
Is this really how people live down here?

49:12.161 --> 49:14.097
Uh, pathetic.

49:16.250 --> 49:17.580
Mother, would you wait?!

49:24.894 --> 49:26.882
Oh, Iolaus! I knew you'd make it!

49:29.449 --> 49:30.444
Yeah, huh.

49:30.750 --> 49:31.195
What?

49:32.273 --> 49:34.812
What? I couldn't stay. I had to get my mom.

49:34.812 --> 49:36.599
I…Xena, I…

49:36.599 --> 49:37.768
Forget it!

49:39.816 --> 49:41.698
Oh, and say hello to Gabrielle.

49:43.122 --> 49:43.952
Gabrielle?

49:44.831 --> 49:46.774
Oh, maybe you didn't recognize her…

49:47.892 --> 49:49.348
…thanks to your family.

50:02.260 --> 50:04.931
Hey meet the former gods of Olympus.

50:06.546 --> 50:08.911
Which one of you animals is Artemis?

50:15.843 --> 50:16.852
Uh, that would be me.

50:40.557 --> 50:44.990
Why, Mother? Why would you go with Zeus, after
the way he's treated us all these years?

50:44.990 --> 50:49.910
I mean,
he's never been there for us, not once. I mean,
what could he possibly have to offer you?

50:53.104 --> 50:53.634
Life.

50:54.326 --> 50:54.673
What?

50:54.673 --> 50:56.572
I know. I know, I should've told you.

50:57.200 --> 50:59.317
I've been ill for
quite some time.

51:00.564 --> 51:03.713
I didn't realize how ill until a
recent visit to the Oracle.

51:04.846 --> 51:06.121
I didn't know what to do.

51:06.123 --> 51:07.687
Then, one day, Zeus appeared.

51:10.661 --> 51:11.041
He knew.

51:12.452 --> 51:15.845
And he made me an offer which would
make up for all his years of neglect.

51:16.634 --> 51:20.809
He would take me to Mount Olympus, where I
would become an immortal.

51:21.961 --> 51:24.112
It was the hardest
decision I ever had to make.

51:26.469 --> 51:29.990
To lose my life, or
risk losing you from my life.

51:31.404 --> 51:32.850
Why didn't you tell me?

51:34.670 --> 51:36.361
I knew you'd try to stop me.

51:36.725 --> 51:38.456
You've always hated
your father so.

51:44.726 --> 51:45.856
As long as you're happy.

51:55.221 --> 51:55.921
What?

51:56.398 --> 51:58.543
What do you mean, you can't change her back?

51:59.335 --> 52:01.937
If I could change her, do you think I'd stay
a bunny rabbit?

52:04.515 --> 52:08.776
Not that I don't, uh, sympathize, believe me, but,
hey, these things happen

52:10.009 --> 52:11.788
Ooh, what do birds your
size eat, anyway?

52:15.001 --> 52:16.029
Oh, I was afraid of that.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.258
It's the Chronos stone.

52:22.038 --> 52:27.349
As long as the Titans
control Mount Olympus, they have the stone, and
we have no powers.

52:28.308 --> 52:31.016
Yeah, we're stuck down here…

52:31.016 --> 52:34.934
…while Hera lives it up on Mount
Olympus with the Titans.

52:53.425 --> 52:55.300
<i>We're the Titans,</i>

52:55.400 --> 52:57.025
<i>we're the best.</i>

52:58.280 --> 53:01.287
<i>We're bigger and we're smarter than the rest.</i>

53:02.618 --> 53:05.804
<i>And after all the years we were repressed,</i>

53:06.684 --> 53:10.356
<i>We're the Titans, we're the best.</i>

53:11.407 --> 53:15.817
<i>We romped on them, we stomped on them,
We blew them to their knees.</i>

53:16.520 --> 53:18.457
Can we boast?

53:20.335 --> 53:22.721
<i>We drowned them and we pounded them,</i>

53:22.724 --> 53:24.474
<i>And squashed them all like fleas.</i>

53:25.496 --> 53:26.982
Now they're toast.

53:28.926 --> 53:32.235
<i>We're the Titans, we are strong.</i>

53:33.289 --> 53:36.748
<i>We knew that we could beat them all along.</i>

53:38.022 --> 53:41.823
<i>They thought that they could win,
but they were wrong, wrong, wrong.</i>

53:41.823 --> 53:45.614
<i>We're the Titans, we are strong.</i>

53:53.571 --> 53:55.146
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

54:04.119 --> 54:07.651
<i>We're the Titans, we're the worst.</i>

54:08.896 --> 54:11.983
<i>We're meaner and we're so much more perversed.</i>

54:13.579 --> 54:16.524
<i>Zeus had all the luck, but now is cursed,</i>

54:17.154 --> 54:20.934
<i>'Cause we're the Titans, we're the worst</i>

54:22.000 --> 54:27.723
<i>We trounced them and we bounced them,
And we pushed them off the edge into the void.</i>

54:28.328 --> 54:30.006
What's a void?

54:30.681 --> 54:33.883
And once the Chronos stone is truly mine…

54:33.883 --> 54:34.499
It's mine.

54:34.645 --> 54:36.166
<i>The world will be destroyed.</i>

54:36.166 --> 54:38.568
I'm getting annoyed.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.907
<i>We're the Titans, we rule the day.</i>

54:43.490 --> 54:47.212
<i>We'll make the gods and little humans pay.</i>

54:48.464 --> 54:51.811
<i>We'll bury them beneath our feet of clay.</i>

54:52.769 --> 54:56.305
<i>We're the Titans, we're okay.</i>

55:21.676 --> 55:23.275
Quiet!

55:26.301 --> 55:28.726
I can't even hear myself gloat.

55:29.742 --> 55:32.923
Just look at
this place! It's a disaster!

55:36.433 --> 55:40.541
I had forgotten just how
stupid you Titans were.

55:40.541 --> 55:42.680
You belong down in Tartarus!

55:47.353 --> 55:48.045
Sorry.

55:54.383 --> 55:58.570
To think I have an eternity of this to look forward to.

56:04.349 --> 56:07.634
Is that old hag going to boss us around forever?

56:07.634 --> 56:13.871
No, not forever. In fact, not much longer.

56:21.913 --> 56:23.341
Gabrielle,…

56:23.826 --> 56:26.237
…this is terrible. I don't know what to do.

56:27.280 --> 56:28.544
I don't know what to do.

56:29.379 --> 56:31.851
This is a fine mess we're in.

56:34.011 --> 56:35.552
I don't know what to do.

56:36.052 --> 56:41.811
<i>I went and let the bad guys win.
Look what they did to you.</i>

56:43.872 --> 56:46.561
<i>I thought I was a warrior.</i>

56:47.357 --> 56:55.638
Still, I failed somehow.
So tell me, what do I do now?

57:00.430 --> 57:06.513
<i>I thought if I did my best,
I'd never make mistakes.</i>

57:07.289 --> 57:10.265
<i>I'd always win the battle,</i>

57:11.556 --> 57:14.249
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

57:15.202 --> 57:21.206
<i>I'd keep my friends from danger.
That's my sacred vow.</i>

57:21.206 --> 57:26.692
<i>So tell me, what do I do now?</i>

57:29.318 --> 57:35.182
<i>Hear me, silver sister moon, shinin' in the blue,</i>

57:36.389 --> 57:42.383
<i>Had I wings to fly away, I would fly to you.</i>

57:46.304 --> 57:49.090
<i>But that's not what warriors do.</i>

57:56.306 --> 57:59.475
<i>Maybe there's more to bein' human,</i>

58:00.681 --> 58:02.823
<i>than actin' brave and strong.</i>

58:03.345 --> 58:06.186
<i>Maybe it's list'ning' to your heart,</i>

58:07.302 --> 58:09.963
<i>and knowin' when you're wrong.</i>

58:10.828 --> 58:17.223
<i>It's keepin' the faith and trustin'
you'll come through, somehow.</i>

58:17.486 --> 58:22.467
<i>And maybe, that's what I'll do now.</i>

58:24.603 --> 58:28.822
<i>I believe we'll come through, me and you.</i>

58:30.375 --> 58:36.021
<i>That's what we'll do… now.</i>

58:41.522 --> 58:42.712
Oh, hi.

58:42.727 --> 58:44.861
So, you're, talking to me, now?

58:46.310 --> 58:51.346
I had no right to blame you for what's happened
to Gabrielle. If I hadn't been so…

58:54.101 --> 58:56.782
We've both made some mistakes, lately.

58:58.262 --> 58:59.447
The
question is,…

59:00.628 --> 59:02.307
what're we gonna do about it, now?

59:08.000 --> 59:09.689
This is all Hercules' fault.

59:09.722 --> 59:14.568
My Dear, you know as well as I, that Hera would
never have revived the Titans if you hadn't brought
me to Mount Olympus.

59:16.418 --> 59:17.600
Well, uh…

59:17.418 --> 59:19.867
And if we had been frank with our son,

59:19.900 --> 59:22.842
he might
have been there at your side when you needed him.

59:22.982 --> 59:26.936
She's right, you know? He's always been there
for me, before.

59:26.936 --> 59:28.397
Yeah, for me, too.

59:28.877 --> 59:31.925
So, in other words, I'm to blame.

59:31.925 --> 59:33.487
No, not really,

59:33.487 --> 59:35.226
but it was good of you to say it.

59:37.191 --> 59:39.175
Hey, why is everyone looking so gloomy?

59:39.725 --> 59:41.686
You think
we're gonna take this lying down?

59:42.664 --> 59:45.656
I would, if I could figure out how to get back up.

59:46.376 --> 59:47.970
Xena and I were talking.

59:47.970 --> 59:50.973
The thought of my mother
spending the rest of her life,

59:50.973 --> 59:55.220
surrounded by a
bunch of whining farm animals who think they
should be ruling the universe…

59:56.405 --> 59:58.727
And Gabrielle staying the way she is.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:02.865
These aren't situations we're prepared just 
to sit back and accept.

01:00:04.011 --> 01:00:05.948
So, we've decided…

01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:08.866
…to attack Mount Olympus.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.659
Why not? The Titans took it from you. We'll just
go up there and take it back from them.

01:00:13.759 --> 01:00:15.256
You've forgotten one thing.

01:00:15.256 --> 01:00:19.585
The Chronos stone. As long as Hera and the 
Titans control it, we have no powers.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:25.115
Well, I don't mean to be insulting, but, 
you didn't do so hot when you had powers, did you?

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:34.159
Son, I mean it. If you go back to Mount Olympus,
there's a good chance you won't come down alive.

01:00:35.218 --> 01:00:38.495
It's a chance I'm willing to take…father.

01:00:57.956 --> 01:00:59.837
Disgusting!

01:01:00.242 --> 01:01:03.427
And you want to rule over all creation? Hah.

01:01:11.821 --> 01:01:13.042
Well,

01:01:13.042 --> 01:01:20.047
coming back to play, are we? Let's make
things a bit more interesting this time…

01:01:20.047 --> 01:01:22.975
and teach
these buffoons a lesson.

01:01:46.132 --> 01:01:49.429
Hey! I feel pain!

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.502
I tingle! Strange! Hold it! Stop it!

01:02:16.968 --> 01:02:17.948
No!

01:02:47.245 --> 01:02:52.289
Now, Hercules and his little friends won't stand
a chance.

01:02:55.012 --> 01:02:59.441
Give me… the stone!

01:03:05.289 --> 01:03:10.282
Get away, you lummox!
Go defend your new empire!

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.377
We have the power, now!

01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:07.211
What are you doing?!
What are you doing?!

01:05:00.558 --> 01:05:04.249
Is it just me, or have these guys gotten even uglier?

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:16.929
Well, one thing's for sure, they
haven't gotten any nicer.

01:06:10.324 --> 01:06:12.748
You know? This could go on forever.

01:06:26.552 --> 01:06:28.489
Got any bright ideas?

01:06:34.852 --> 01:06:39.135
Now that you mention it, I do have a thought.
Keep them busy!

01:07:10.245 --> 01:07:11.781
Throw them over the side!

01:08:32.573 --> 01:08:37.082
It's no good. He draws his power from the earth,
and every time he goes down, he gets stronger.

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:39.035
Yeah. What can we do?

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.171
I've got an idea. Come on.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:57.508
You should've quit when you were ahead, little man.

01:09:04.805 --> 01:09:05.805
Grab him!

01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:22.850
I… never… quit!

01:09:26.634 --> 01:09:28.238
Now! Drop him!

01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:23.180
Hercules!

01:10:32.309 --> 01:10:35.364
Climb, Gabrielle, climb! Back to Olympus! Hurry!

01:11:18.095 --> 01:11:20.631
Hey, nice job with that monster.

01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:23.763
You didn't do so badly yourself.

01:11:47.745 --> 01:11:50.021
Gabrielle, can you ever forgive me?

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:55.825
There's nothin' to forgive. I knew you'd come
through for me.

01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.268
I sort of enjoyed the flying part.

01:12:02.138 --> 01:12:04.989
It was fun while it lasted.

01:12:13.805 --> 01:12:15.632
He's…he's here.

01:12:25.137 --> 01:12:27.525
I will miss you every day.

01:12:30.674 --> 01:12:31.828
Just remember,…

01:12:32.578 --> 01:12:34.043
…I'll be watching over you.

01:12:55.009 --> 01:12:55.833
Son,…

01:12:57.872 --> 01:12:59.621
…you know you're always welcome at
my, uh…

01:12:59.621 --> 01:13:00.816
Yeah, I know.

01:13:24.037 --> 01:13:25.795
She'll be okay.

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:28.448
He does care for her.

01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:35.648
So, where are you headed?

01:13:36.448 --> 01:13:39.436
Corinth. I still have a bag of gold to return.

01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:43.526
Maybe, we could walk along with you for a while.

01:13:44.608 --> 01:13:45.486
Sure.

01:13:45.486 --> 01:13:46.783
That'd be great.

01:13:49.906 --> 01:13:52.989
And along the way, you can teach me that great
kick you did up there against Porphyrion.

01:13:52.989 --> 01:13:55.761
Sure, if you'll teach me how to flip a Titan.

01:13:55.761 --> 01:13:58.796
I would love to, but it's a family secret.
