WEBVTT

00:06.940 --> 00:08.442
GOOD MORNING.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.878
STEVE, WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

00:10.944 --> 00:12.780
THE WATER'S OFF
AT OUR PLACE, CARL.

00:12.846 --> 00:16.150
AND ESTELLE WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO LET ME USE HER BATHTUB.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.619
OOPS! I FORGOT MY DUCKY.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.124
KID HIS AGE STILL
USING BATH TOYS.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.294
COME ON, MR. QUACKERS.

00:30.598 --> 00:34.568
HE LOVED ESTELLE'S
BUBBLE BATH. HE HE HE.

00:45.779 --> 00:49.550
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION
IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

00:49.617 --> 00:53.121
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

00:53.187 --> 00:56.824
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

00:56.890 --> 00:58.058
* SOME PEOPLE SAY *

00:58.126 --> 01:00.761
* IS EVEN HARDER
TO FIND *

01:00.828 --> 01:04.332
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:04.398 --> 01:08.336
* INSIDE THESE
GENTLE WALLS *

01:08.402 --> 01:11.772
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:11.839 --> 01:16.310
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN' OUT
OF EVERY SEAM *

01:17.145 --> 01:19.980
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:20.047 --> 01:24.084
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:24.152 --> 01:26.720
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:26.787 --> 01:30.858
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:30.924 --> 01:33.794
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:33.861 --> 01:37.431
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:37.498 --> 01:41.735
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

01:41.802 --> 01:44.805
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:44.872 --> 01:49.710
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY **

02:01.222 --> 02:02.890
PUT THESE ON THE TABLE, BABY.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.397
SO, EDDIE,
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.200
I HEAR JANEY BROWN IS HAVING
A BIG PARTY TONIGHT.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.668
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.371
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

02:19.940 --> 02:25.145
I WONDER HOW LONG THEY'D
GROUND ME IF I BROKE YOUR ARM.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.680
COME ON, LAURA.
TEST ME.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.483
I GOT THIS CAR REPAIR STUFF
DOWN COLD.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.453
I'M GOING TO ACE
THIS SUCKER.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.489
WHAT ARE THE STEPS
IN ADJUSTING A CARBURETOR?

02:35.556 --> 02:38.392
STEP ONE--YOU LOOSEN
THE LAMBDA LOCKNUT.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.229
STEP TWO-- YOU TIGHTEN PRIMARY
ADJUSTMENT SCREWS.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.531
STEP THREE--YOU...

02:43.597 --> 02:44.732
YOU...

02:44.798 --> 02:46.500
WHAT IS STEP THREE?

02:46.567 --> 02:49.737
YOU GET THE GREASY BOOK
OFF THE TABLE SO WE CAN EAT.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.508
WHEN YOUR CAR
NEEDS A TUNE UP,

02:54.575 --> 02:58.612
YOU'LL BE GLAD I'M TAKING
THIS ADULT EDUCATION CLASS.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.480
HEY, EVERYBODY!

02:59.547 --> 03:00.381
HI, CARL.
HI, DADDY.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.216
I'VE GOT BIG NEWS.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.784
YOUR FATHER'S
THE POLICEMAN

03:03.851 --> 03:06.287
WITH THE BEST SAFETY RECORD
IN THE ENTIRE CITY.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.020
GREAT!
CONGRATULATIONS!

03:07.087 --> 03:09.056
WAIT, WAIT.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.858
THERE'S MORE.
BECAUSE OF THAT,

03:10.924 --> 03:13.794
I'LL BE DRIVING
IN THE COLUMBUS DAY PARADE.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.095
SHUT UP!
WAIT. WAIT.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.530
DON'T GO CRAZY YET!

03:16.597 --> 03:18.832
NOT ONLY WILL I BE
IN THE PARADE,

03:18.899 --> 03:21.335
I'M DRIVING
THE LEAD CAR.

03:22.903 --> 03:23.937
YOU CAN GO CRAZY.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.839
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

03:25.906 --> 03:27.775
COME ON, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING OUTSIDE.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.510
I WONDER WHAT IT IS.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.146
COME ON!
OH!

03:33.213 --> 03:34.815
ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.317
WOW!

03:37.418 --> 03:40.354
THIS IS A 1936 FORD!

03:40.421 --> 03:42.423
RIGHT, RACHEL.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.892
CARL, YOU'RE TALKING
TO A CAR LOVER.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.394
THIS BABY HAS A V-8

03:46.460 --> 03:47.695
WITH A DUAL THROAT
CARBURETOR

03:47.761 --> 03:51.832
AND 221 CUBIC INCHES
OF RAW POWER!

03:55.035 --> 03:55.969
WHERE'D YOU
GET IT, CARL?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.305
THE POLICEMEN'S MUSEUM.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.808
THIS CAR WAS ACTUALLY
DRIVEN BY ELLIOTT NESS.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.577
DID HE HAVE THE BEST SAFETY
RECORD LAST YEAR?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.649
LOOK. I'VE BEEN
PRACTICING MY WAVE.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.888
LET'S GO
FOR A SPIN.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.924
B-B-B-BUT FREEZE!

04:18.359 --> 04:20.093
BACK AWAY SLOWLY.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.063
KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.266
YOU'RE GOING
TO READ US OUR RIGHTS?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.268
HARRIETTE,
THIS CAR IS AN ANTIQUE.

04:28.336 --> 04:29.637
IT'S SIGNED OUT TO ME.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.739
IT'S OUT OF BOUNDS, OFF-LIMITS.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.542
NO ONE TOUCHES IT BUT ME.
UNDERSTAND?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.611
I DO, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SIMPLIFY IT FOR EDDIE.

04:53.193 --> 04:57.197
MY SON, THE SAFEST DRIVER
ON THE POLICE FORCE.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.700
I'M SO PROUD OF HIM.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.370
I TAUGHT HIM HOW TO DRIVE.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.204
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD DRIVE.

05:04.271 --> 05:08.409
OH, SURE. I GAVE IT UP WHEN
THEY LOWERED THE SPEED LIMIT.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.512
SHH..

05:11.579 --> 05:13.681
WE DON'T WANNA
WAKE CARL UP.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.385
DON'T WORRY, CARL CAN SLEEP
THROUGH WORLD WAR THREE.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.593
HARRIETTE, LET'S
LOOK AT THAT CAR,

05:25.659 --> 05:26.794
UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.696
WAIT. CARL SAID NOT
TO TOUCH IT.

05:28.762 --> 05:32.032
COME ON.
I JUST WANT TO LOOK.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.300
I DON'T KNOW.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.469
PROMISE, I'LL KEEP
MY HANDS OFF.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.439
I GUESS IT'S OKAY
IF YOU DON'T TOUCH IT.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.308
GREAT. I JUST LOVE
THESE OLD CARS.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.412
EACH ONE HAS ITS
OWN PERSONALITY AND QUIRKS.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.713
LIKE MEN.

05:45.779 --> 05:46.580
THAT'S TRUE.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.181
SOME DON'T
LOOK LIKE MUCH,

05:48.248 --> 05:51.084
BUT THEY CAN
REALLY MOVE.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.820
OTHERS ARE
REAL FLASHY,

05:52.886 --> 05:54.788
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
UNDER THE HOOD.

06:06.266 --> 06:10.003
BOY, THEY DON'T MAKE THEM
LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.507
OOH, I JUST LOVE THE WAY
THE CHROME SETS OFF

06:13.574 --> 06:16.777
THE CONTOURS
OF THE HOOD,

06:16.844 --> 06:21.014
AND LOOK AT THIS SUBTLE
FLEXING CURVE IN THIS FENDER.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.384
YOU TWO WANT TO BE ALONE?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.290
I LOVE THIS CAR.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.493
IT IS PRETTY.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.528
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.697
NOT IF YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT DRIVING IT.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.867
THAT'S WHAT
I'M THINKING.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.068
YOU MUST BE CRAZY.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.171
CARL WOULD KILL US IF HE KNEW
WE WERE EVEN LOOKING.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.706
HE'LL NEVER KNOW.
HE'S ASLEEP.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.476
HE COULD WAKE UP.
WE CAN'T TAKE CHANCES.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.778
HARRIETTE,
YOU ARE SO CAUTIOUS,

06:50.844 --> 06:52.480
SO AFRAID
TO TAKE RISKS.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.415
HONEY, YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE,
HARRIETTE, LIVE!

06:55.483 --> 06:56.617
I DON'T MIND LIVING.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.719
IT'S THE DYING
I'M TRYING TO AVOID.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.825
HARRIETTE, FOR ONCE, DON'T BE
THE SENSIBLE OLDER SISTER.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.560
YOU'RE
A STICK-IN-THE-MUD.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.929
LOOSEN UP.
LET YOURSELF GO!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.165
GO WHERE?

07:13.601 --> 07:16.537
AROUND THE BLOCK,
PLEASE?

07:16.604 --> 07:17.771
I'LL NEVER GET
ANOTHER CHANCE

07:17.838 --> 07:20.474
TO DRIVE A CLASSIC CAR
LIKE THIS.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.842
I DON'T KNOW.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.512
I'LL BE REALLY,
REALLY CAREFUL. I PROMISE.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.048
ONCE AROUND THE BLOCK?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.351
GREAT!

07:31.418 --> 07:33.487
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.688
I MAKE THE RULES.

07:34.755 --> 07:38.025
RIGHT TURNS ONLY.
GO SLOW.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.192
YEAH, YEAH, FINE.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.332
[ENGINE STARTS]

07:45.398 --> 07:46.399
OKAY.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.570
NOW ADJUST THE MIRROR

07:49.637 --> 07:50.838
AND USE HAND SIGNALS.

07:50.904 --> 07:54.174
IN FACT, WE'LL BOTH
USE HAND SIGNALS.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.743
HARRIETTE,
WOULD YOU RELAX?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.878
NOTHING IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.721
[CRASH]

08:27.541 --> 08:29.209
OH.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.248
OOH...

08:35.315 --> 08:38.285
ARE YOU IN TROUBLE.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.089
ME? YOU WERE
THE ONE DRIVING.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.925
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO STOP ME.
YOU'RE OLDER.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.629
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO
"LIVE, HARRIETTE, LIVE"?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.831
THAT WAS BEFORE YOU
WRECKED THIS.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.965
YOU DROVE!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.934
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO WARN ME

08:54.001 --> 08:57.004
IF SOMETHING JUMPED OUT
IN FRONT OF THE CAR.

08:57.070 --> 08:57.871
IT WAS A TREE!

08:57.938 --> 09:01.374
IT'S BEEN THERE
FOR 100 YEARS!

09:01.441 --> 09:04.311
WELL, I NEVER
NOTICED IT.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.814
LOOK, RACHEL.
THIS ISN'T HELPING.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.249
WE'LL JUST TELL CARL
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.951
CARL WILL GO CRAZY!

09:11.018 --> 09:12.519
HE STILL HASN'T
FORGIVEN ME

09:12.586 --> 09:15.589
FOR BREAKING HIS FLINTSTONES
COFFEE MUG.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.725
HARRIETTE,
WE CAN'T TELL HIM.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.527
RACHEL, CARL HAS TO DRIVE
THIS CAR TOMORROW.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.096
HE'S BOUND TO NOTICE.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.998
NOT IF I FIX IT FIRST.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.836
YOU COULDN'T EVEN GLUE FRED
AND BARNEY BACK TOGETHER.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.938
THAT WAS A CUP!
THIS IS A CAR!

09:31.004 --> 09:33.907
I GOT A IN BODY AND FENDER WORK.
I CAN FIX IT TONIGHT!

09:33.974 --> 09:37.377
EVEN IF YOU COULD, WHICH
I DOUBT, CARL SHOULD KNOW.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.713
NO. NO.
YOU CAN'T TELL CARL.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.281
I CAN UNDO
THE DAMAGE

09:41.348 --> 09:42.983
IF YOU JUST
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.053
PLEASE, DON'T TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.355
YOU'RE ALL I GOT.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.259
DON'T GIVE ME THAT "DON'T TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME" SPEECH.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.361
I'VE HEARD IT 1000 TIMES.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.430
YEAH, BUT THIS TIME
I MEAN IT.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.166
PLEASE.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.370
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO WITH YOU?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.115
WHA--

10:48.181 --> 10:51.284
NEVER SNEAK UP ON SOMEONE
HOLDING A BLOWTORCH.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.953
I'LL TRY
TO REMEMBER THAT.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.031
YES?

11:04.097 --> 11:07.367
I CHECKED ON THE BABY,
AND HE'S STILL ASLEEP.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.002
THANK YOU.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.747
ARE YOU AIMING
TO LOSE THAT FINGER?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.816
SORRY. HOW LONG IS
THIS GOING TO TAKE?

11:22.883 --> 11:25.385
WHAT TIME DOES CARL
LEAVE FOR THE PARADE?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.721
WHY? WILL THIS
TAKE ALL NIGHT?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.790
THIS IS
A DELICATE OPERATION.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.592
YOU DON'T JUST SLAP
IT ON WITH CRAZY GLUE.

11:32.659 --> 11:35.395
I'LL HAVE IT READY.
NOW EXCUSE ME.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.772
WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT HERE?

11:47.374 --> 11:50.710
HEY, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.748
RELAX. RACHEL DID IT.

11:54.815 --> 11:58.385
YOUR MOTHER
AND I DID IT.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.287
WHY?

12:00.353 --> 12:02.990
IT'S PAST 1:00.
WHY AREN'T YOU IN BED?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.359
MOM, I HAVE TO BE
HOME AT 11:00.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.462
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE RULES
ABOUT SLEEPING.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.532
EDDIE, I SURE COULD USE
ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.301
CAN I USE
THE TORCH?

12:14.367 --> 12:15.502
NO! NO!

12:17.470 --> 12:18.505
I'LL GO
AND CHECK

12:18.571 --> 12:20.707
IF CARL IS
STILL SLEEPING.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.544
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.814
PUT THESE
IN THE TOOL BOX FOR ME.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.330
CARL!
HARRIETTE!

12:44.697 --> 12:46.900
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.937
YOU SAID YOU'D CUT OUT
THE MIDNIGHT SNACKS.

12:50.003 --> 12:54.441
I HEARD THE BULB
IN THE REFRIGERATOR GO OUT.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.276
NOPE, IT'S OKAY.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.446
AH, HOW DID THAT
GET IN MY HAND?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.682
MY GOSH, HARRIETTE,
I'VE BEEN SLEEPWALKING.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.084
CARL, LET'S GO
BACK TO BED.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.120
I CAN'T SLEEP NOW. SOMEBODY'S
MAKING NOISE OUTSIDE.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.824
THE RICHARDSONS ARE HAVING
A WILD PARTY.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.960
SOUNDS LIKE
BODY AND FENDER WORK.

13:13.026 --> 13:16.263
NO, NO. IT'S THAT NEW MUSIC--
HEAVY METAL.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.898
VERY HEAVY METAL.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.735
HEAVIER THAN
THE OLD HEAVY METAL.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.838
WHAT WERE YOU
DOING OUTSIDE?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.174
I WENT TO TELL THE RICHARDSONS
TO QUIET DOWN,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.510
BUT IT MAY
LAST ALL NIGHT. LET'S GO.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.744
MOM!

13:31.811 --> 13:33.280
DAD.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.716
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:36.783 --> 13:39.686
ARE YOU JUST GETTING IN?
GETTING IN?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.055
IT'S TWO HOURS
PAST YOUR CURFEW.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.592
WELL, DAD, YOU SEE,
I WAS JUST...

13:45.658 --> 13:46.894
I WAS JUST, UH...

13:46.960 --> 13:49.029
YOU WERE JUST
BREAKING YOUR CURFEW!

13:49.096 --> 13:49.997
MOM!

13:50.063 --> 13:51.731
AND AFTER
BEING GROUNDED.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.967
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
WELL--

13:54.034 --> 13:55.268
NEVER MIND.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.138
YOU'RE GROUNDED
TWO MORE WEEKS.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.172
WHAT?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.909
NOT ANOTHER WORD.
JUST GO TO BED.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.843
GO TO BED.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.815
HARRIETTE.
CARL.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.351
WE SHOULDN'T TALK WHILE
WE'RE MAD AT EDDIE.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.419
LET'S GO TO SLEEP

14:12.485 --> 14:15.322
AND DISCUSS THIS TOMORROW
WHEN YOU COOL OFF.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.305
HOW MUCH TIME
DO I HAVE?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.942
CARL WON'T BE UP
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.010
GOOD. WE'LL MAKE IT.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.346
YOU BETTER PUT ON
ANOTHER POT OF COFFEE.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.115
REGULAR OR DECAF?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.957
BETTER MAKE IT DECAF.

14:52.926 --> 14:55.628
MOM, WOULD YOU
PLEASE SIGN THIS?

14:55.695 --> 14:56.596
WHAT IS IT?

14:56.663 --> 14:57.764
IT'S A CONFESSION.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.499
IT SAYS YOU
DID EVERYTHING,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.468
AND I DID NOTHING.

15:01.534 --> 15:05.238
I TOLD YOU I'D GET YOU OFF
THE HOOK. AFTER IT SETTLES DOWN.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.574
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO YOU BEFORE THEN?

15:07.640 --> 15:10.210
I NEED EVIDENCE THAT
WILL STAND UP IN COURT.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.952
WELL, HOW DO I LOOK?

15:21.021 --> 15:23.056
WHY ARE YOU
DRESSED SO EARLY?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.491
YOU'VE GOT THREE HOURS.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.827
I'M THE LEAD CAR.
I HAVE TO BE EARLY.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.463
OH, YOU'VE GOT
A LOOSE BUTTON.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.300
WHERE?
THERE.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.737
IT WAS HANGING
BY A THREAD.

15:37.804 --> 15:40.440
YOU BETTER GET YOUR MOTHER
TO SEW THAT BACK ON.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.981
IF YOUR FATHER
COMES BACK DOWN,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.582
PULL ANOTHER
BUTTON OFF!

15:51.351 --> 15:54.387
OKAY, BUT I'M ADDING
THAT TO THE CONFESSION!

16:02.362 --> 16:03.130
RACHEL.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.999
WILL YOU STOP
DOING THAT?

16:06.066 --> 16:08.135
WE'VE GOT AN EMERGENCY.
CARL WANTS TO LEAVE NOW!

16:08.201 --> 16:10.737
NO. YOU GOT TO STALL HIM!
I NEED MORE TIME!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.205
OKAY, MORE TIME.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.946
WE'VE GOT A FAMILY CRISIS.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.348
WHAT KIND
OF CRISIS?

16:21.414 --> 16:25.752
RACHEL AND I SMASHED
THE POLICE CAR. DAD CAN'T KNOW.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.155
LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.458
YOU AND AUNT RACHEL TRASHED THE
CAR, DAD DOESN'T KNOW,

16:31.524 --> 16:35.962
AND YOU WANT US TO BE
PART OF THE COVER-UP.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.564
THAT'S THE
GENERAL IDEA.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.567
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.170
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS
COMES ALONG ONCE,

16:43.236 --> 16:44.937
MAYBE TWICE,
IN A LIFETIME.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.540
I WANT A BIKE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.676
A PONY.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.878
THE KID'S GOT POTENTIAL.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.014
YOU GUYS, THIS IS
A FAMILY CRISIS.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.117
WE'VE ALL GOT
TO PULL TOGETHER.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.487
I'LL TAKE
A DIRT BIKE.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.455
WELL, I'M LEAVING.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.191
NOBODY TOUCH ME.

17:04.257 --> 17:08.161
YOU CAN'T GO WITHOUT BREAKFAST.
YOU LOOK FRAIL.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.863
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.332
WHY ARE
YOU STALLING ME?

17:12.399 --> 17:14.801
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO STALL YOU.
IF WE WERE,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.136
WE'D TRY TO KEEP YOU,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.105
WHICH WE'RE NOT.
SO JUST GO.

17:20.573 --> 17:24.177
DO YOU WANT SOME COFFEE?
NO. I'M LEAVING.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.045
DAD,
MY TONSILS HURT.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.081
OH,
MINE, TOO.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.683
YOU HAD YOURS TAKEN OUT
FOUR YEARS AGO.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.020
I MEAN MY FEET.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.822
ALRIGHT. WHAT IS
GOING ON AROUND HERE?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.090
NOTHING.
NOTHING.
NOTHING.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.392
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE CAR.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.827
OHH!

17:43.530 --> 17:46.799
EDDIE, YOU HAVE
THE I.Q. OF FROZEN YOGURT.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.069
WHAT?

17:52.805 --> 17:55.175
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW I LOVE YOU,

17:55.242 --> 17:56.843
AND REMEMBER,
YOU LOVE ME, TOO.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.580
MOVE, HARRIETTE.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.354
GOOD MORNING.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.326
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:13.393 --> 18:15.094
JUST CLEANING
A SQUASHED BUG

18:15.162 --> 18:16.496
OFF YOUR HEADLIGHT.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.698
I WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PICTURE PERFECT

18:18.765 --> 18:20.267
FOR THE PARADE.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.802
THANK YOU, RACHEL.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.937
THAT'S
VERY THOUGHTFUL.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.573
YEAH, THANKS, RACHEL.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.943
SEE YOU ALL
DOWNTOWN.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.112
HAVE A NICE
PARADE, CARL.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.448
WE'RE PROUD
OF YOU, DAD.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.789
WE'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PARADE.

18:42.855 --> 18:43.756
BYE, DAD!

18:43.823 --> 18:45.258
HAVE A GOOD TIME!

18:48.895 --> 18:51.998
RACHEL, I'VE GOT TO SAY
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.833
I SAID WE COULD DO IT.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.670
WE ARE SNEAKY GOOD.
YOU KNOW, AUNT RACHEL.

18:57.737 --> 19:01.274
YOU'RE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE
FOR THE KIDS.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.409
BY THE WAY, MOM,

19:02.475 --> 19:03.843
I HATE
TO SAY THIS,

19:03.910 --> 19:06.246
BUT THERE'S STILL
THIS LITTLE MATTER

19:06.313 --> 19:09.449
OF A BICYCLE
AND PONY.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.784
HEY, DON'T FORGET
MY DIRT BIKE.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.288
KIDS, I'M HURT.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.257
AFTER ALL I'VE
DONE FOR YOU,

19:17.324 --> 19:20.660
I'D THINK YOU'D DO
THIS TINY THING FOR ME

19:20.727 --> 19:22.462
WITHOUT EXPECTING
SOMETHING.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.764
WELL, MOM,
YOU WERE WRONG.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.470
[DOORBELL RINGS]

19:30.537 --> 19:33.240
HARRIETTE, WE ARE NOT
GOING TO BE BLACKMAILED.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.474
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

19:34.541 --> 19:37.877
THAT ANYTHING WAS EVER WRONG
WITH THAT CAR.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.686
I'M GOING
TO THE PARADE NOW.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.323
AND I SUGGEST YOU ALL GET
YOUR STORIES STRAIGHT.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.391
NOT THAT IT MATTERS,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.059
BECAUSE
WHEN I COME BACK,

19:53.125 --> 19:56.396
I PLAN TO DO
A LOT OF YELLING.

20:12.078 --> 20:16.148
IT WAS A NICE DAY.
IT DIDN'T RAIN.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.884
I WISH IT HAD.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.152
THEY WOULD HAVE
CANCELED IT.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.854
CARL LOOKED
SO MISERABLE.

20:21.921 --> 20:27.594
WHEN HE CAME BY,
I COULD HEAR HIM GRINDING
HIS TEETH OVER THE BAND.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.463
WE ARE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.766
HA HA HA.
NOT ME!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.234
I'VE GOT WRITTEN PROOF

20:35.302 --> 20:37.904
THAT NONE OF THIS
IS MY FAULT.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.907
LOOK, IT'S ALL
MY FAULT, OKAY?

20:40.973 --> 20:43.876
I'M GONNA TAKE FULL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.813
I'LL HOLD LITTLE RICHIE
WHEN I TELL CARL THAT.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.115
CARL, BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
LET ME EXPLAIN.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.617
IT'S RACHEL'S
AND MY FAULT.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.053
WE WERE WRONG
TO DRIVE IT, AFTER WE DENTED IT

21:27.119 --> 21:29.589
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE REPAIRED IT
BEHIND YOUR BACK,

21:29.656 --> 21:31.858
AND DRAG
THE KIDS INTO IT.

21:31.924 --> 21:36.262
WE WERE WRONG. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SORRY I AM.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.565
AW, HARRIETTE.
I REALLY WANTED TO YELL.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.971
CARL, I'M SORRY, TOO.
I WAS DRIVING THE CAR.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.174
I HOPE YOU
CAN FORGIVE ME.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.942
I'M SORRY,
TOO, DAD.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.611
ME, TOO.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.981
ME, TOO.

21:55.047 --> 21:58.317
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DIDN'T COME TO ME

21:58.385 --> 21:59.952
WHEN YOU WERE
IN TROUBLE.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.654
WE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE UPSET.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.591
I WOULD
HAVE EXPLODED.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.558
THEN I WOULD HAVE
COOLED DOWN

22:05.625 --> 22:07.059
AND WORKED WITH YOU.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.761
INSTEAD, YOU
DECEIVED ME.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.530
NOW THAT'S
WHAT HURTS.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.699
SORRY. IT'LL
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.967
ME, TOO, CARL.
I PROMISE.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.403
I PROMISE.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.704
I PROMISE.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.271
I PROMISE.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.409
OKAY. YOU GUYS ARE
ALL OFF THE HOOK.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.745
BUT, GUYS, REMEMBER,
WE'RE A FAMILY.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.747
YOUR PROBLEMS
ARE MY PROBLEMS,

22:27.814 --> 22:31.083
BUT I CAN'T HELP UNLESS
YOU TELL ME ABOUT THEM.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.252
OKAY.
RIGHT, BABY.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.254
FROM NOW ON,
WE STICK TOGETHER.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.589
YEAH.

22:37.957 --> 22:41.160
BY THE WAY,
WHO FIXED THE FENDER?

22:41.227 --> 22:42.595
RACHEL DID.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.732
THINK YOU COULD
DO IT AGAIN?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.199
SURE. WHY?

22:47.266 --> 22:49.569
WELL,
AFTER THE PARADE,

22:49.636 --> 22:52.972
I ACCIDENTALLY BACKED
INTO THE SONS OF ITALY FLOAT.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.744
I'LL GET THE TORCH.
