THIS IS GREAT, YOU KNOW.
YOU REALLY GOT TO MEET DEBRA.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.052
- I COULD'VE
SIGNED THE BOOK FOR YOU

00:18.086 --> 00:19.187
AT THE STORE, YOU KNOW.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.721
- YEAH, BUT SHE'S A BIG
BASKETBALL FAN.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.656
COME ON, THIS WILL BE FUN,
COME ON.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.261
- JEEZ,
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LEAVE

00:27.295 --> 00:28.462
A SIGNED BASKETBALL
OR SOMETHING.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.497
- NO, NO, NO.
THIS WILL BE GREAT.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.432
WATCH THIS.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.101
DEB, DEB--

00:33.134 --> 00:35.136
- OH, HI.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.472
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE BASKETBALL
PLAYER OF ALL TIME?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.774
- MICHAEL JORDAN.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.811
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.846
RETIRED,
RETIRED BASKETBALL PLAYER?

00:45.879 --> 00:48.048
- OH, LARRY BIRD.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.787
- HE PLAYED FOR THE LAKERS.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.823
- WILT CHAMBERLAIN.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.661
- YOU KNOW,
THIS ISN'T MY HOUSE.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.631
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.333
- I WANT MY BOOK BACK.

01:05.366 --> 01:08.169
- KAREEM, COME ON,
I'LL MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.704
HI, I'M RAY.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.440
I LIVE HERE
IN LONG ISLAND

01:12.473 --> 01:14.808
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA--

01:14.842 --> 01:22.150
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER--

01:22.183 --> 01:24.752
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:24.785 --> 01:29.157
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.758
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.427
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.266
AND--DONE.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.446
- DID YOU HEAR
HOWIE SIMON'S SON

01:52.480 --> 01:55.283
SOLD ONE OF THOSE FUNNY LITTLE
ANECDOTES TO "READER'S DIGEST"?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.685
- YEAH, OKAY, GOOD.
GOOD FOR HIM.

01:57.718 --> 02:01.189
- THAT'S $50.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.591
- YEAH?

02:03.624 --> 02:06.694
- SO WHY CAN'T YOU
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.262
- DAD, I'M A WRITER, DAD.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.664
THE NEWSPAPER PAYS ME
TO WRITE FULL-TIME.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.366
- LOOK, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE SPORTS COLUMN;

02:12.400 --> 02:13.434
THAT'S GREAT.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.170
I'M TALKING ON THE SIDE.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.873
- FUNNY ANECDOTES
ON THE SIDE?

02:19.907 --> 02:22.610
- YEAH, THAT'S FREE MONEY
FOR YOU.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.611
- OKAY.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.679
- HERE.
LAMB CHOPS.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.948
- AW, MOM, I GOT DINNER!
SHE'S COOKING--

02:27.981 --> 02:29.617
ALL RIGHT, ONE.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.586
LOOK, DAD,
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE,

02:32.620 --> 02:35.456
BUT I'M NOT WRITING ANYTHING
FOR "READER'S DIGEST."

02:35.489 --> 02:36.324
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

02:36.357 --> 02:38.226
YOU CAN AFFORD
TO TURN DOWN EXTRA CASH?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.861
I'M TALKING
ON THE SIDE.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.829
- MA, WHERE'S THE--

02:41.862 --> 02:44.232
- OH, THE MINT JELLY.
YEAH, YEAH. HOLD ON.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.567
HERE,
RIGHT HERE.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.637
- WE'RE TALKING
THE "DIGEST" HERE, RAY.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.738
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF TALENT

02:50.771 --> 02:53.207
IT TAKES TO TAKE A NOVEL
LIKE THIS--

02:53.241 --> 02:55.843
AND PUT IT
ON A PAGE AND A HALF?

02:55.876 --> 02:56.977
THAT'S WRITING.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.979
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH ALREADY, DAD.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.714
LOOK, IF YOU LIKE
THE MAGAZINE SO MUCH,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.550
WHY DON'T YOU GO WRITE
SOMETHING FOR IT YOURSELF?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.884
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:03.917 --> 03:06.554
- YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.756
WHY DON'T YOU GET OFF YOUR
REAR END AND DO IT YOURSELF?

03:08.789 --> 03:10.491
I THINK
IT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.592
- YOU DO?
- UH-HUH.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.461
- I TELL YOU WHAT;

03:13.494 --> 03:14.295
YOU GO WRITE SOMETHING
FOR THE "READER'S DIGEST."

03:14.328 --> 03:16.264
I'M GOING TO GO HOME
AND FAKE HUNGER.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.567
- OH.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.734
- GIVE ME THAT CHOP.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.276
- THE "READER'S DIGEST."

03:28.309 --> 03:31.612
THEY DO HAVE SOME FUNNY STUFF
IN THERE. HEH, HEH, HEH.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.981
[laughs]

03:34.014 --> 03:37.818
[howls with laughter]

03:41.555 --> 03:44.358
[show on TV] IF YOU'RE HAPPY
AND YOU KNOW IT,

03:44.392 --> 03:45.959
CLAP YOUR HANDS.
[clapping]

03:45.993 --> 03:48.462
- HEY.
- HEY.

03:48.496 --> 03:51.532
- HEY, OH, BOY,
WHAT ARE WE WATCHING?

03:51.565 --> 03:54.268
- OH, "WE SING IN SILLYVILLE."

03:54.302 --> 03:55.569
HEY, GUESS WHAT?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.771
IT'S ON MORNINGS
AND EVENINGS NOW.

03:57.805 --> 03:58.939
TWICE THE SILLY.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.808
- YAY!
- OH, YEAH.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.743
- [singing] THERE GOES JOHN
JACOB JINGLEHEIMER SCHMIDT.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.579
DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!

04:05.613 --> 04:09.450
- OKAY.
WE HAVE TO CANCEL CABLE.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.751
- YEAH.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.953
OKAY, GO UP
AND GET YOUR JAMMIES ON.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.658
UH, RAY?

04:17.691 --> 04:18.726
- YEAH?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.594
- ROBERT'S STILL HERE.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.863
- OH, HEY, ROBERT,
WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?

04:22.896 --> 04:25.799
- I HAD A SUSPICION
I NEED TO CONFIRM.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.735
- ROBERT, WHAT'S WRONG?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.805
- I DON'T THINK MICHAEL
LIKES ME ANYMORE.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.808
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:34.842 --> 04:36.477
- HE'S NOT LIKE GEOFFREY.

04:36.510 --> 04:40.080
HE SEEMS STANDOFFISH.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.417
- YOU KNOW MICHAEL'S
A BABY, RIGHT?

04:43.451 --> 04:44.918
- IT'S JUST A FEELING.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.954
COP'S INSTINCT.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.289
HE WANTS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.626
- ATTENTION, EVERYBODY.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.563
GUESS WHO IS NOW
A PUBLISHED WRITER.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.565
- WHO?
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:57.598 --> 05:00.000
- TODAY THE MAILMAN
BROUGHT ME FAME AND FORTUNE.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.469
THE "READER'S DIGEST."

WILL NOW OPEN TO PAGE 64,

05:10.378 --> 05:13.581

SECTION.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.783
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.420
- LET'S SEE HERE.

05:19.453 --> 05:23.791
- AH, OH, MY.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.792
DID YOU KNOW, MA?

05:24.825 --> 05:25.793
DID YOU KNOW
HE WAS DOING THIS?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.060
- PLEASE.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.762
YOU THINK HE COULD
GET THIS DONE BY HIMSELF?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.064
THE MAN CAN'T
WIPE HIS OWN CHIN.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.866
- MARIE WAS
MY LITTLE TYPIST.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.537
- DON'T CALL ME
YOUR LITTLE TYPIST.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.972
- SO, UH, WHY DON'T YOU
READ IT OUT LOUD, RAY?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.475
- NO, NO, WE DON'T--
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY, DAD.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.943
WE'LL READ IT.
- NO, NO, COME ON.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.345
YOU HAVE SUCH A NICE
SPEAKING VOICE.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.652
- "THROUGHOUT OUR FIRST WEEK

06:03.564 --> 06:05.633
"THE IMPORTANCE

06:08.436 --> 06:10.938
[laughs]

06:10.971 --> 06:12.673
- "SIR, YES, SIR;

06:12.706 --> 06:14.908
"SIR, I DON'T KNOW, SIR;

06:14.942 --> 06:17.445
"A FEW DAYS LATER, A COLONEL

"AND ASKED
WHAT I WAS WORKING ON.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.449
"USING THE SIR SANDWICH,
I SAID,

"SIR, CHECKING THE OIL, SIR,

"AND, SIR,
CHECKING THE TIRES, SIR.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.156
"THE COLONEL
LAUGHED AND SAID,

06:29.189 --> 06:31.525
"PRIVATE, I APPRECIATE
YOUR RESPECT,

06:31.559 --> 06:34.895
BUT I DON'T NEED
A SIR CLUB SANDWICH."

06:34.928 --> 06:38.532
- [laughs]

06:41.735 --> 06:44.872
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.707
TRUE STORY.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.077
HEY, RAY,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.680
- OH, IT'S A CLASSIC, DAD.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.183
- AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
LOOK AT THIS.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.953
A CHECK FOR $300.
- OOH!

06:59.987 --> 07:01.655
- I'D FRAME IT,
BUT THEN I COULDN'T TAKE

07:01.689 --> 07:03.924
MY LITTLE TYPIST
OUT FOR A FANCY DINNER.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.460
- [laughing]

07:06.494 --> 07:08.161
EVERY TIME YOU CALL ME THAT,

07:08.195 --> 07:12.566
IT'S GOING TO COST YOU
300 BUCKS.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.801
- MICHAEL
THREW HIS MILK AT ME.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.068
- OH!
- OH!

07:18.606 --> 07:20.173
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.476
THAT COULD BE
MY SECOND STORY.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.778
THE "DIGEST" LOVES
A NAUGHTY BABY.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.586
"TEENAGE BOYS
CAN BE SHY AND AWKWARD.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.723

"AND THEY'RE AFRAID

THIS WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE
FOR MY SON ROY."

07:42.763 --> 07:44.732
- DAD, YOU'RE
WRITING ABOUT ME.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.767
- IT SAYS "ROY."

07:46.800 --> 07:49.236
- OH, THANKS, DOD.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.506
- HEY, LOOK,

07:52.540 --> 07:55.576
I'M USING WHAT WE CALL
ARTISTIC LICENSE THERE.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.977
SURE, I'M WRITING
ABOUT MY KID,

07:57.010 --> 07:59.513
BUT IT'S GOT TO COME OFF
LIKE ANYBODY'S KID.

07:59.547 --> 08:03.216
YOU SEE, I HAVE TO WRITE
AS THE EVERYMAN.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.084
- YOU'RE THE EVERYMAN?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.819
- RIGHT.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.021
IT'S GOT TO MEAN SOMETHING
TO DEBRA AND MARIE,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.758
THE GUY IN SNOWBOUND SWEDEN
LOOKING FOR A LAUGH.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.727
- OH, ESPECIALLY HIM.
YEAH, OKAY.

08:13.761 --> 08:16.564
LOOK, DAD, I GOT A COLUMN DUE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR, ALL RIGHT?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.999
SO I'M GOING TO SEE YOU.
OKAY.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.134
- "ROY,
BEING A TYPICAL TEENAGER,

08:21.168 --> 08:24.805
"WAS BESIEGED
BY RAGING HORMONES--

08:26.740 --> 08:30.510
MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO
KEEP HIS MIND ON HIS STUDIES."

08:32.145 --> 08:33.714
- OH, MY GOD.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.116
- OOH,
HE'S THE EVERYMAN.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.751
- CAN YOU IMAGINE?

08:37.785 --> 08:40.187
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF EVERY MAN
WAS FRANK BARONE?

08:40.220 --> 08:41.622
- NOPE.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.856
- BOY, WOULDN'T
SIZZLER LOVE THAT?

08:42.890 --> 08:43.657
- YEAH.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.892
- DO ME A FAVOR.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.259
PLEASE, KEEP EVERYMAN
OUT OF HERE.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.928
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.964
- HOW FAST CAN YOU MAKE
A POT ROAST?

08:50.998 --> 08:52.833
- SO WHAT'S THE COLUMN ABOUT,
RAY?

08:52.866 --> 08:53.901
- OH--

08:53.934 --> 08:54.968
- GOT TO GO.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.738
- NO!

08:57.771 --> 09:00.874
IT'S THE GIANTS, DAD.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.744
- GO ON. GO ON.
DON'T LET ME BOTHER YOU.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.250
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST PART,
ISN'T IT?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.251
- WHAT?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.821
- THAT.
THE BLANK PAGE.

09:13.854 --> 09:18.158
IT JUST SITS THERE
AND MOCKS YOU, DARES YOU--

09:18.191 --> 09:22.295
- ANNOYS YOU.
BOTHERS YOU.

09:22.329 --> 09:25.065
- I GUESS SO.
WELL, GO ON, WRITE.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.200
CONQUER THE BLANK PAGE.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.702
I'M NOT EVEN HERE.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.078
SHOULDN'T YOU INDENT?

09:39.947 --> 09:41.114
- DAD, DON'T YOU WANT
TO GET STARTED

09:41.148 --> 09:42.616
ON THAT STORY
ABOUT THE TWINS?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.986
- NO RUSH.
IT'S FERMENTING.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.288
- WELL, DON'T LET IT GO BAD
IN THERE, DAD.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.190
COME ON.
GO, GO.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.625
RUN.
RUN WITH IT.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.761
I'M ASKING YOU, DAD,
AS A PROUD PARENT.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.795
RUN.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.929
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU KNOW.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.197
I GOT TO GO GET STARTED.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.799
- YEAH, OKAY.

10:03.370 --> 10:06.073
- YOU KNOW, RAY,

10:06.106 --> 10:09.710
WHEN I RETIRED,
I THOUGHT, "WELL, THIS IS IT."

10:09.743 --> 10:11.912
YOU KNOW, I--SOMETIMES
I JUST SIT THERE SAYING,

10:11.945 --> 10:13.914
"I GOT NOTHING LEFT."

10:13.947 --> 10:15.082
BUT WITH
THIS WRITING THING,

10:15.115 --> 10:17.217
IT'S LIKE I GOT
A WHOLE NEW LEASE ON LIFE.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.819
I--I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.955
IT'S LIKE, FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A WHOLE LOT OF YEARS,

10:21.989 --> 10:26.927
I FEEL GOOD.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.961
- THAT'S--
THAT'S GOOD, DAD.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.197
THAT'S NICE.
I--I'M GLAD.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.866
- WELL, I GOT YOU
TO THANK FOR IT.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.868
YOU'RE A WRITER.
- YEAH.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.405
- I LOOK AT YOU,
AND I SEE WHAT I HAD IN ME.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.040
HEY, YOU KNOW,

10:40.073 --> 10:42.209
NOW WE KNOW WHERE
YOUR TALENT COMES FROM.

10:44.177 --> 10:48.415
SO GO ON.
SHOW ME YOUR CHOPS.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.884
DID YOU KNOW MARK TWAIN
HAD A SON WHO WAS A WRITER?

10:50.918 --> 10:51.685
- NO.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.253
- YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY CALLED HIM?

10:53.286 --> 10:55.355
- NO.
- CHOO-CHOO.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.891
CHOO-CHOO TWAIN!
HA, HA, HA.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.827
THAT WAS
IN THE "DIGEST."

11:08.902 --> 11:10.938
- OH, HI, RAY.
YOU HUNGRY?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.740
- NO, NO.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.041
- SHOULDN'T YOU BE
AT WORK?

11:14.074 --> 11:17.210
- YEAH, I WAS, MA,
UNTIL DAD STOPPED BY.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.912
- OH.
- YEAH.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.448
I'M HAVING LUNCH
AT THE PAPER WITH THE GUYS,

11:21.481 --> 11:23.183
AND HE JUST SHOWS UP.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.185
HE STARTS TELLING US
ABOUT WRITING.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.020
TELLING US!

11:28.822 --> 11:31.992
WHEN I LEFT, HE WAS TEACHING US
ABOUT ALLITERATION.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.928
SO, FEARING MY FATHER
THE FREAK,

11:34.962 --> 11:39.166
I FLED BEFORE
THERE WAS A FATALITY.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.469
- LOOK AT THESE.
LOOK AT THESE HANDS.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.372
I USED TO MAKE ANGEL HAIR PASTA
WITH THESE HANDS.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.708
AND NOW,
I'M A GREASE MONKEY!

11:50.310 --> 11:51.812
- YOU HAVE TO
TALK TO HIM, MA.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.346
- NO, HE DOESN'T
LISTEN TO ME.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.415
WHAT, YOU THINK
I LIKE DOING THIS?

11:55.448 --> 11:57.785
OH, I HAVE A LIFE TOO.

11:57.818 --> 12:01.755
I COULD BE OUT
LEARNING FRENCH.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.123
- MA, YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.925
- WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

12:06.359 --> 12:09.029
NO, RAYMOND, RAYMOND,
YOU HAVE TO HANDLE THIS.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.764
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.132
- WHAT ARE YOU--
HOW IS IT MY PROBLEM?

12:12.165 --> 12:13.233
WHAT DID I DO?

12:13.266 --> 12:15.002
- YOU'RE THE WRITER.
HUH?

12:15.035 --> 12:17.871
HE WANTS YOUR APPROVAL.
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.873
JUST TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

12:19.907 --> 12:20.841
- TALK TO DAD?

12:20.874 --> 12:23.443
OH, WHERE DO YOU COME UP
WITH THAT STUFF, MA?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.347
- HEY, RAY,
THERE YOU ARE.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.483
HEY, YOUR FRIENDS
ARE REALLY GUNG-HO

12:30.517 --> 12:32.953
ABOUT THAT COMPUTER STUFF.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.089
PERSONALLY, I DON'T SEE
WHAT THEY'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.860
MAYBE IT'S ALL THAT
INTERNET PORNO.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.195
- JUST TALK
TO YOUR FATHER.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.565
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.
I'M AN INK-STAINED WRETCH.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.235
- HEY, DAD, THIS WHOLE
WRITING THING, DAD,

12:48.268 --> 12:49.803
I'M--
I'M GLAD YOU FOUND IT,

12:49.837 --> 12:51.338
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE SOMETHING.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.841
- YOU MEAN THE "DIGEST"?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.075
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU $1,000

12:55.108 --> 12:58.111
IF YOU STOP CALLING IT
"THE 'DIGEST.'"

12:58.145 --> 13:01.181
- FAIR ENOUGH.
TESTING, TESTING.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.349
- LISTEN,
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

13:02.382 --> 13:04.918
THAT WE'RE HONEST HERE
WITH EACH OTHER.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.020
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.421
- YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT,

13:08.455 --> 13:11.825
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
I WAS AFRAID TO ASK YOU.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.126
- WHAT?

13:13.160 --> 13:16.163
[Frank sighs]

13:16.196 --> 13:19.933
"FRANK BARONE'S
I WAS JUST THINKING."

13:19.967 --> 13:22.169
- YEAH, MY THOUGHTS ON A BUNCH
OF SUBJECTS, YOU KNOW?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.837
INFOMERCIALS--

13:23.871 --> 13:25.605
THE NEW CAR SMELL--

13:25.638 --> 13:27.174
MINUTE RICE--
STUFF LIKE THAT.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.475
IT'S ALL THERE.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.543
- YEAH, IT IS.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.046
WHY DO I HAVE IT?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.882
- WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO BE HONEST.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.151
I HONESTLY THINK THIS WOULD MAKE
A GREAT COLUMN IN YOUR PAPER.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.021
- MY PAPER?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.991
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
PASS IT ON TO THE EDITOR?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.159
- YOU WANT ME TO SHOW THIS
TO MY EDITOR?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.394
- THANK YOU, RAY.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.430
AND, UH, TELL HIM--

13:50.463 --> 13:52.966
I LOOK FORWARD
TO HIS FEEDBACK.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.638
- OH, MA!

13:58.671 --> 14:01.141
- [crying]
IT DOESN'T COME OUT.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.076
IT DOESN'T COME OUT!

14:11.551 --> 14:12.585
- HI.
- HI.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.354
- HI, HI.
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO--

14:14.387 --> 14:19.226
I'M GOING TO BE HIDING
FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, OKAY?

14:19.259 --> 14:21.394
SO IF MY FATHER
COMES BY LOOKING,

14:21.428 --> 14:22.462
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.097
- WHAT?

14:24.131 --> 14:26.566
- LISTEN, YOU GOT TO RUN
INTERFERENCE FOR ME, OKAY?

14:26.599 --> 14:27.968
I'D DO THE SAME
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.403
- MY PARENTS
LIVE IN CONNECTICUT.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.572
- I'M WILLING TO GO.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.909
MATTER OF FACT, HE'D NEVER
FIND ME IN CONNECTICUT.

14:35.943 --> 14:39.312
- WHY ARE WE
HIDING TODAY, RAY?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.114
- LOOK AT THAT.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.183
- "FRANK BARONE'S
I WAS JUST THINKING."

14:43.216 --> 14:44.651
WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S HIS COLUMN.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.420
- HIS COLUMN?
- HIS COLUMN.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.422
YEAH, HE WANTS ME
TO HAND IT TO MY EDITOR.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.591
- OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.426
- LOOK AT THIS.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.996
"THE CHIRP OF THE CRICKET HAS
BEEN REPLACED BY THE CAR ALARM.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.665
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT WILL
REPLACE THE CAR ALARM."

14:58.698 --> 15:03.136
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN?

15:03.170 --> 15:05.538
OH, GOD,
HE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.607
- "LIKE THE SMELL
OF A FRESHLY-PAINTED ROOM

15:07.640 --> 15:09.342
"AS MUCH AS THE NEXT GUY,

15:09.376 --> 15:13.113
BUT IN THE END,
WALLPAPER IS EASIER TO CLEAN."

15:13.146 --> 15:15.015
HMM.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.516
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
SO HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

15:16.549 --> 15:19.552
BUT, COME ON, HOW CAN
I HAND THAT TO MY EDITOR?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.221
HE'S GOING
TO TEAR IT UP.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.355
- YOU KNOW, RAY,

15:22.389 --> 15:25.125
I THINK YOU SHOULD LET
YOUR EDITOR TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.460
- WHY? SO EVERYONE AT WORK
LOSES RESPECT FOR ME?

15:27.494 --> 15:28.661
AND THEN I GET FIRED, RIGHT?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.297
AND THEN YOU CAN
GO BACK TO WORK,

15:30.330 --> 15:31.631
AND I STAY WITH THE KIDS.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.433
NO, NO, NO.

15:33.466 --> 15:37.237
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THAT,
DELILAH.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.706
- NO, NO, YOU TAKE
HIS NAME OFF OF IT,

15:39.739 --> 15:41.374
AND THEN YOU SUBMIT IT
TO YOUR EDITOR.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.176
THEN HE GIVES YOU
SOME HONEST FEEDBACK,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.012
WHICH YOU CAN PASS ON
TO YOUR FATHER,

15:45.045 --> 15:48.215
AND ALL OF THIS WILL END.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.351
- HEY, THAT'S NOT BAD.
THAT'S NOT BAD.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.686
MY EDITOR'S
GOING TO HATE THIS.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
AW, I'M DOING IT.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.624
I'M GOING TO DO THAT.
- GOOD.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.460
- OH, TELL ME THE STORY AGAIN
ABOUT THE PARENTS

16:00.493 --> 16:04.297
THAT LIVE ALL THE WAY
IN CONNECTICUT.

16:04.331 --> 16:07.300
- ONCE UPON A TIME--
- SLOWER. SLOWER.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.668
- ONCE UPON A TIME--

16:08.701 --> 16:10.037
- LOUDER AND FUNNIER.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.238
- YEAH.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.575
- HEY, ROB,
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.077
COME ON IN.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.679
- WHY?

16:19.712 --> 16:22.415
- I JUST WANTED YOU TO TRY
PLAYING WITH MICHAEL AGAIN.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.716
YOU KNOW, JUST GIVE IT
ONE MORE SHOT.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.319
- NAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.688
- LISTEN, ROBERT, IT JUST--
IT MAKES ME FEEL TERRIBLE

16:28.721 --> 16:31.091
THAT YOU THINK ONE OF YOUR
NEPHEWS DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.625
COME ON.
COME ON IN.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.664
ROBERT, COME ON.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.104
SIT.
JUST SIT DOWN.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.440
YEAH, THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.276
IT'S UNCLE ROBBIE.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.013
UNCLE ROBBIE.
YEAH.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.051
- HOW YOU DOING?

17:00.353 --> 17:03.256
HEY, MICHAEL,

17:03.290 --> 17:06.025
WOULD YOU LIKE UNCLE ROBERT
TO READ YOU A STORY?

17:08.195 --> 17:10.597
HEY, HE'S NOT THAT TOUGH
AFTER ALL.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.336
"BABY BUNNIES
HAVE SUCH FUN.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.506
BUNNIES ON THE HOP,
SKIP, RUN"--

17:19.539 --> 17:23.343
- HEY.
- HEY.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.811
LOOK AT ME AND MICHAEL.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.182
- YOU AND MICHAEL?
NO, YOU MEAN YOU AND GEOFF--

17:29.216 --> 17:31.184
[baby talk]

17:31.218 --> 17:33.320
AND MICHAEL.
YES, MICHAEL.

17:33.353 --> 17:37.124
YEAH, YEAH, YOU GOT IT.
THAT'S MICHAEL.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.425
- SEE?
- YEAH.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.493
[telephone rings]

17:40.527 --> 17:43.263
HELLO?
HEY, BILL.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.098
OH, YOU READ THE COLUMN.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.268
NO, NO, I DIDN'T WRITE THAT.
DID NOT WRITE THAT.

17:48.301 --> 17:52.639
NO, NO, I PASSED THAT ON TO YOU
FROM A COMPLETE STRANGER GUY.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.108
UH-HUH. YEAH.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.543
OKAY.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.847
WOW.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.783
WAS THAT CALL WAITING,
OR DID A VEIN POP?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.789
YEAH.
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.259
RIGHT.
SO VERY SORRY.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.860
OKAY,
BYE-BYE.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.130
OH, UGLY, UGLY!

18:17.164 --> 18:19.766
OH, THAT WAS UGLY.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.774
- OH, HI, RAY.
HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.243
YOU HUNGRY?
- NO.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.312
- MARIE, MARIE, I GOT TO GET
MY THOUGHTS DOWN

18:32.345 --> 18:36.149
ON "TAPIOCA:
LIKE IT OR LUMP IT?"

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
- OH, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.721
I'M GOING TO GO LIE DOWN--
UNDER THE CAR.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.457
- HEY, RAY.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.825
- HEY.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.360
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

18:47.394 --> 18:48.861
- UH, NOTHING,
NOTHING.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.164
I, UH--I TALKED
TO MY EDITOR TODAY.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.632
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.334
- AND?

18:54.367 --> 18:56.169
- WELL, UH,
I GUESS THE NEWSPAPER,

18:56.203 --> 18:59.272
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR A COLUMNIST RIGHT NOW.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.809
- WELL, I--I DON'T HAVE
TO BE A "COLUMNIST."

19:02.842 --> 19:05.845
I MEAN, MY PIECES CAN RUN
EVERY SO OFTEN IN THE PAPER.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.248
- YEAH, WELL, THEY SAID
THEY ALREADY GOT SOMETHING

19:08.281 --> 19:11.384
SIMILAR TO YOUR PIECE
IN--IN THERE.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.819
- WELL, WHAT?

19:12.852 --> 19:15.455
WHAT IN YOUR PAPER
IS SIMILAR TO WHAT I WROTE?

19:15.488 --> 19:19.559
- IN TONE; SIMILAR IN TONE
IS WHAT HE ACTUALLY SAID.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.794
- THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S DODGING SOMETHING.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.896
IS HE SOME KIND OF
AN ODDBALL HERE?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.398
- HE'S NOT AN ODDBALL, DAD.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.400
LOOK, IT JUST--
IT WASN'T FOR HIM, THAT'S ALL.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.935
- WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY?
WHAT WERE HIS EXACT WORDS?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.237
- I DON'T KNOW
HIS EXACT WORDS.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.738
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.573
YOU JUST SPOKE TO HIM, AND YOU
CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID?

19:33.606 --> 19:34.874
- DAD, YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.609
- DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR

19:36.643 --> 19:37.977
OR WHAT
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.546
TELL ME WHAT HE SAID!

19:39.579 --> 19:41.881
- HE SAID
IT WAS EMBARRASSING!

19:44.284 --> 19:47.420
- WHAT?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.989
- HE SAID
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.493
- OH.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.894
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.897
- DAD--
- WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

19:57.930 --> 20:01.200
- HE SAID IT WAS AMATEURISH.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.671
- REALLY?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.005
- I'M SORRY, DAD.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.641
- NO, NO, NO, IT--
IT'S OKAY.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.709
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:09.742 --> 20:11.444
YOU CAN'T TRUST
WHAT THIS GUY SAYS.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.381
WHAT DOES HE KNOW?
HE'S AN ODDBALL, THAT GUY.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.648
HUH? SO WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT IN THE PAPER.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.717
YOU'RE IN THE "DIGEST."

20:17.750 --> 20:20.019
- AMATEURISH?

20:20.052 --> 20:23.723
- 27 MILLION PEOPLE,
IN 19 LANGUAGES.

20:23.756 --> 20:24.624
PEOPLE ARE READING THIS

20:24.657 --> 20:26.459
IN GERMANY AND JAPAN
AS WE SPEAK, DAD.

20:26.493 --> 20:31.664
COME ON, HUH?
NOBODY READS NEWSPAPERS.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.467
- YOU KNOW, I--
I WAS FEELING SO GOOD.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.902
NOW I DON'T KNOW.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.672
- DAD, THE "DIGEST." SEND IT IN.
SEND IT TO THE "DIGEST."

20:39.706 --> 20:41.608
- I DID!

20:41.641 --> 20:43.710
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT EITHER.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.513
THAT'S WHY I TRIED
YOUR STUPID PAPER!

20:49.416 --> 20:50.883
- WELL, COME ON, YOU CAN'T
JUST GIVE UP, DAD, HUH?

20:50.917 --> 20:52.452
- AW--
- COME ON, YOU STILL GOT

20:52.485 --> 20:54.321
ALL THOSE ROY STORIES
IN THERE.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.856
COME ON.
WHAT ABOUT EVERYMAN?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.558
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE EVERYMAN?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.626
YOU GOT ALL THOSE OPINIONS.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.060
THEY'RE JUST FERMENTING
IN THERE.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.695
GOT TO LET THEM OUT.

21:02.729 --> 21:06.065
GOT TO LET THEM OUT, DAD,
OR YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLODE.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.300
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.035
I GOT OPINIONS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.603
- NOW WHO CAN I
SHARE THEM WITH?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.738
- WELL, COME ON,
THERE'S ALWAYS--

21:11.771 --> 21:13.873
- MY FAMILY.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.808
- I WAS THINKING
GUYS AT THE LODGE,

21:15.842 --> 21:19.446
AND PEOPLE AT BUS STOPS,
AND CLERKS.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.981
- HEY, WAIT.
WAIT, HERE'S ONE.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.452
"POETRY:
GET TO THE POINT."

21:26.853 --> 21:28.355
- THERE YOU GO.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.021
WHO COULD ARGUE WITH THAT?
YOU CAN'T.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.557
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.459
"HOW ABOUT THOSE POEMS
THAT DON'T EVEN RHYME?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.894
THAT IS THIS MAN'S
DEFINITION OF LAZY."

21:34.927 --> 21:37.096
- AH.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.466
MY JOB IS DONE HERE.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.434
- "MAKE UP YOUR MIND,
AMERICA.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.670
IS IT
OFF-EN OR OFTEN?"

21:43.703 --> 21:46.072
- AH, HA!

21:46.105 --> 21:47.940
YOU'RE THE KING
OF THOSE.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.842
ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO
GO RUN AND TELL EVERYBODY.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.378
- HEY, RAY--

21:54.046 --> 21:56.315
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF MY COLUMN?

21:59.051 --> 22:02.489
- I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, DAD.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.756
- THANKS.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.097
"AMISH PEOPLE:

22:11.130 --> 22:13.400
FRIEND OR FOE?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.939
- [laughing]

22:19.972 --> 22:26.579
[speaking Japanese]

22:26.613 --> 22:29.916
"ROY."

22:29.949 --> 22:32.619
[all laughing]

22:32.652 --> 22:38.157
[all laughing uproariously]

22:38.190 --> 22:39.426
"ROY."
