WEBVTT

00:02.186 --> 00:04.381
The security system
is being disabled.

00:06.057 --> 00:09.151
There's a plane arriving here in the
morning to take you to Mexico City

00:09.427 --> 00:11.395
if we can keep
you alive that long.

00:18.002 --> 00:19.867
Get us on the ground.

00:20.238 --> 00:22.365
What's wrong with your side?
There's a bullet in it.

00:23.908 --> 00:28.402
I don't go after any suspect
without checking out his background.

02:28.650 --> 02:32.484
<i>Yes. Yes,
I have received the pictures.</i>

02:32.554 --> 02:36.854
But we cannot do business until
you first identify yourself.

02:37.025 --> 02:39.653
You say you are
a private investigator?

02:42.864 --> 02:45.355
<i>You are asking for
a lot of money,</i>

02:45.801 --> 02:49.601
how do I know you have all the
other information that you claim?

02:50.539 --> 02:51.631
Yes.

02:52.507 --> 02:55.101
<i>Yes, I can be there in an hour.</i>

02:55.510 --> 02:57.273
Yes. I will come alone.

03:13.595 --> 03:16.758
<i>The Pacific horizon can be
a very inspiring sight.</i>

03:16.832 --> 03:18.766
<i>But it can also be
kind of depressing</i>

03:18.834 --> 03:22.531
<i>when you find your personal horizons
a little lacking in rainbows.</i>

03:23.005 --> 03:26.907
<i>Paradise has a way of seducing you
into a sense of stagnant well-being.</i>

03:26.975 --> 03:29.205
<i>A feeling that you're
experiencing life at its best,</i>

03:29.311 --> 03:31.006
<i>so why go looking
for anything better?</i>

03:31.246 --> 03:34.875
<i>Then one day I realized why
rainbows never get boring to look at.</i>

03:34.983 --> 03:36.245
<i>They're always changing.</i>

03:36.351 --> 03:39.320
<i>My own colors were
fading from standing still.</i>

03:39.521 --> 03:42.718
<i>So why not put a couple
of new humps on my horizon?</i>

03:42.791 --> 03:45.351
<i>Grow, change,
learn some new things.</i>

03:45.427 --> 03:47.122
<i>Spread my wings
and fly a little.</i>

03:47.195 --> 03:50.130
<i>Even if I fell back to earth a
couple of times in the process.</i>

03:50.198 --> 03:51.722
<i>Pull up on the collective.</i>

03:52.567 --> 03:56.936
<i>Easy. Easy... Hey, I've got
it. I've got it. That's it.</i>

03:57.506 --> 03:59.064
<i>No more lessons from me.</i>

03:59.408 --> 04:01.342
<i>Oh, come on, one little mistake.</i>

04:02.210 --> 04:03.575
<i>One little...</i>

04:04.813 --> 04:07.111
<i>You had us going
backwards on the lift-off,</i>

04:07.249 --> 04:09.843
<i>at 2,000 you had us
going sideways,</i>

04:10.052 --> 04:13.283
<i>and then you came within inches of
crashing us into the landing pad.</i>

04:13.855 --> 04:16.084
<i>Well, what about
all the things I did right?</i>

04:16.491 --> 04:18.550
<i>What about all
the things I've learned?</i>

04:19.827 --> 04:21.887
<i>Sure. Right.</i>

04:22.597 --> 04:24.497
<i>After six hours of
flight lessons,</i>

04:24.566 --> 04:26.124
<i>you learned how to
shut the engine off.</i>

04:26.201 --> 04:27.828
<i>I've learned more than that.</i>

04:28.270 --> 04:29.703
Like what?

04:30.005 --> 04:33.202
You keep making the same
mistakes every time we fly.

04:33.575 --> 04:35.805
<i>T. C., I'll double
what I pay you.</i>

04:35.911 --> 04:37.344
Sure you will.

04:37.746 --> 04:39.805
If you get that job in Oklahoma.

04:40.082 --> 04:43.142
No ifs. I'll get it.
I just have to be a pilot.

04:43.218 --> 04:46.051
<i>Look, I can make more
there in one three week job</i>

04:46.121 --> 04:48.180
than I can here
in an entire year.

04:48.690 --> 04:50.351
If you're a pilot.

04:50.892 --> 04:52.655
You are not a pilot.

04:52.928 --> 04:54.919
You are not going to be a pilot.

04:54.996 --> 04:57.624
Why don't you call that oil
company and tell them you lied.

04:57.699 --> 04:59.189
I did not lie.

04:59.701 --> 05:00.929
Not exactly.

05:01.603 --> 05:04.197
<i>Besides, you know there's more
at stake here than just a job.</i>

05:04.272 --> 05:08.106
What if we're up there one day
and you suddenly have an attack?

05:08.577 --> 05:11.068
<i>Well, this young
man's heart is just fine,</i>

05:11.146 --> 05:13.876
as long as he doesn't let you
touch that stick.

05:20.589 --> 05:23.149
<i>T. C., you all right?</i>

05:24.392 --> 05:26.724
<i>T. C., come on.
Stop fooling around.</i>

05:40.809 --> 05:43.209
You should consider
yourself most fortunate.

05:43.278 --> 05:44.540
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

05:44.913 --> 05:46.710
I'm sorry. I guess
I'm a little worked up

05:46.781 --> 05:48.772
about losing
10 days of solid bookings.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.181
Can't fly for 10 days?

05:50.285 --> 05:52.617
<i>Perhaps for two weeks,
according to the doctors.</i>

05:52.787 --> 05:54.482
What did you learn at the police station?

05:54.689 --> 05:56.953
<i>Just that they think the
gunman fired from the highway,</i>

05:57.025 --> 05:58.617
across from the helipad.

05:58.693 --> 06:01.059
<i>You have any idea
who might have done it, T. C?</i>

06:01.830 --> 06:03.798
Are you kidding?
I wish I did.

06:03.932 --> 06:05.900
<i>Well, never mind.
I'll come up with something.</i>

06:06.034 --> 06:08.002
You just concentrate
on getting well.

06:08.336 --> 06:11.100
<i>I mean, if you heal fast,
you might be flying in a week.</i>

06:12.107 --> 06:13.506
<i>What? No, no.</i>

06:13.642 --> 06:15.701
<i>Forget it. No more flying
lessons for you, buddy.</i>

06:15.777 --> 06:17.108
<i>Magnum, how could you?</i>

06:17.646 --> 06:18.772
<i>Thomas, I don't believe it.</i>

06:18.847 --> 06:21.281
<i>Is that all you've got to think
about, is your pilot's license?</i>

06:21.349 --> 06:24.284
<i>No. Come on,
that's not what I meant.</i>

06:24.719 --> 06:27.051
Getting my pilot's license
is the farthest thing

06:27.122 --> 06:29.181
from my mind till we
find out who shot at T.C.

06:29.257 --> 06:31.316
<i>Mmm-hmm. Then you're going
for the license, right?</i>

06:31.393 --> 06:32.826
Well sure. Why not?

06:32.928 --> 06:36.364
<i>I'm making progress. Magnum,
please. Give up this folly.</i>

06:36.431 --> 06:39.958
Call that chap in Oklahoma
and admit to him that you lied.

06:40.035 --> 06:41.127
I didn't lie.

06:41.203 --> 06:44.172
<i>"The guy said," Will you be
able to fly our company chopper</i>

06:44.239 --> 06:46.036
"around the oil fields
to investigate?"

06:46.107 --> 06:48.769
<i>He didn't say "Can you?" He
said, "Will you be able to?"</i>

06:48.843 --> 06:51.209
And I will be able to.
I've got six weeks.

06:52.747 --> 06:55.978
The noontime news is on. I'm gonna see
if there's anything about the shooting.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.416
<i>Okay, so nobody believes me.</i>

06:58.486 --> 07:00.647
<i>But once we find
out who shot at T. C.,</i>

07:00.755 --> 07:04.521
<i>I will somehow, someway
get my pilot's license.</i>

07:04.859 --> 07:06.053
In six weeks?

07:06.127 --> 07:07.719
Oh.

07:08.597 --> 07:11.088
Good luck
with your new instructor.

07:11.299 --> 07:12.561
<i>Shh! Quiet, guys.</i>

07:12.634 --> 07:16.502
<i>By a gunshot today. He had reportedly
just finished giving a flying lesson.</i>

07:16.705 --> 07:20.641
<i>Calvin, owner-operator of Island
Hoppers Air Charter Service, was,</i>

07:20.875 --> 07:24.402
<i>according to HPD reports,
shot once, in the chest,</i>

07:24.479 --> 07:26.447
<i>presumably with
a high-powered weapon,</i>

07:26.514 --> 07:28.106
<i>and from
a considerable distance.</i>

07:28.183 --> 07:31.983
<i>However, an Island Hoppers spokesman
is now quoted as saying that</i>

07:32.387 --> 07:34.912
<i>foul play is not suspected.</i>

07:37.292 --> 07:39.658
<i>Well, that brings us
around to the lighter...</i>

07:39.728 --> 07:42.856
What idiot would give out
such a ludicrous statement?

07:43.431 --> 07:46.366
The same idiot that
claims to be my spokesman.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.865
<i>Well, somebody had
to mind the store.</i>

07:49.504 --> 07:52.996
I heard the news report on the radio
about the shoot... The accident.

07:53.642 --> 07:56.839
<i>So, well, naturally, my first
inclination was to rush to the hospital.</i>

07:57.078 --> 07:58.773
Naturally.
Exactly.

07:58.980 --> 08:02.472
<i>"But then I thought," No, no, that's
just what all his good friends will do</i>

08:02.584 --> 08:03.949
"and I'd just be in the way."

08:04.219 --> 08:07.188
<i>So, then, naturally, the next
thought that occurred to me was,</i>

08:07.255 --> 08:09.382
"Who's looking
after T.C.'s business?"

08:09.824 --> 08:13.089
So you just naturally
rushed on down here

08:13.161 --> 08:15.152
and took charge
in a moment of crisis?

08:15.430 --> 08:17.694
Exactly. And lucky I did.

08:17.866 --> 08:21.427
Because when I got here the place was
standing open and crawling with press.

08:21.603 --> 08:24.572
<i>But don't worry, these are the last
two left and they're just leaving.</i>

08:24.773 --> 08:26.206
I handled all of them.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.407
Like that stupid crack that
foul play wasn't suspected?

08:29.477 --> 08:30.569
Shh!

08:31.179 --> 08:33.203
<i>Naturally I told them
foul play wasn't suspected,</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:35.181
I'm trying to save T.C.'s
image here.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.111
<i>I mean, who would want to fly with
a guy somebody's trying to kill?</i>

08:38.186 --> 08:40.552
<i>Yeah. That's very
thoughtful of you, Mac.</i>

08:40.722 --> 08:41.711
Thank you.

08:41.856 --> 08:46.793
<i>So, can you empty your pockets
and show me your wallet?</i>

08:49.264 --> 08:50.526
I think I'm being insulted.

08:50.632 --> 08:52.600
<i>No, just accused, naturally.</i>

08:53.001 --> 08:57.165
<i>T.C. Always has about 500 in cash
in his office, for emergencies.</i>

08:57.238 --> 08:59.035
Now if I walk in
there and don't find it...

08:59.107 --> 09:00.335
<i>Well, you won't!</i>

09:00.642 --> 09:03.167
Because I secured
all the cash I found.

09:04.412 --> 09:08.781
I hate that word! Don't say
secured when you mean stole!

09:08.850 --> 09:10.841
I secured all the cash.

09:11.286 --> 09:13.049
Now if somebody had
snuck in there and stolen it

09:13.121 --> 09:15.851
<i>while I'm still on the premises, I'd
feel pretty silly, now, wouldn't I?</i>

09:16.057 --> 09:19.356
<i>What else is missing, Mac?
Nothing.</i>

09:19.427 --> 09:22.123
I haven't taken anything from
that office. I have only given.

09:22.230 --> 09:26.064
<i>Of my time, my creativity, and
my years of managerial experience.</i>

09:26.134 --> 09:27.294
<i>Mac, please leave.</i>

09:28.737 --> 09:30.295
<i>Well, you're welcome.</i>

09:32.374 --> 09:34.342
He wouldn't put himself out
for a little cash.

09:34.409 --> 09:36.343
<i>With this guy,
it's always a major angle.</i>

09:36.411 --> 09:37.571
Naturally.

09:37.812 --> 09:40.440
<i>Well, we've got to take care
of T.C.'s biggest problem.</i>

09:40.515 --> 09:42.346
Help me tie down
the rotors of the chopper.

09:42.417 --> 09:43.509
Then we'll go...

09:46.254 --> 09:48.722
<i>Mac?
Okay, what's missing?</i>

09:49.224 --> 09:50.555
What was he after?

09:50.892 --> 09:52.826
<i>Mac didn't take
anything from the office.</i>

09:52.961 --> 09:57.489
<i>T. C., why do most of your shipping
invoices list unspecified cargo?</i>

09:58.500 --> 10:00.991
<i>Because some of the shippers
are too lazy to itemize.</i>

10:01.903 --> 10:03.530
<i>Yeah, well, maybe
they don't want to.</i>

10:03.605 --> 10:06.073
Maybe they tried to slip in
some kind of contraband

10:06.141 --> 10:08.405
and got scared that
you found out.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.938
<i>And I would have, too.</i>

10:10.512 --> 10:12.207
<i>I check every unspecified item.</i>

10:12.380 --> 10:18.046
<i>Look, maybe I just got hit by some idiot
with lousy aim out taking target practice.</i>

10:19.020 --> 10:21.580
<i>Hey, don't forget to lock up.
Struck out.</i>

10:22.090 --> 10:23.751
<i>And check my
messages for me, too.</i>

10:23.858 --> 10:25.883
<i>What? Yeah, sure, T.C.</i>

10:26.327 --> 10:28.955
Did you and Rick have any
problems securing the chopper?

10:31.733 --> 10:36.033
<i>Well, actually Mac secured
the chopper. No problem.</i>

10:36.104 --> 10:37.731
<i>Oh, great, thanks.</i>

10:38.573 --> 10:41.269
<i>Oh, yeah, the doc says I'll
be out some time late tomorrow.</i>

10:41.443 --> 10:42.967
<i>Tomorrow? No, stay there.</i>

10:43.311 --> 10:44.642
I mean it's safer there.

10:45.113 --> 10:49.743
You expect me to stay here at 300
bucks a day until we find the sniper?

10:49.818 --> 10:51.012
No way.

10:51.786 --> 10:54.687
<i>No, I guess not.
Bye, T.C.</i>

10:55.290 --> 10:57.417
<i>Thomas, he's gonna want to come
by here the minute he gets out.</i>

10:57.492 --> 10:58.959
Now we gotta go
find the chopper.

10:59.127 --> 11:00.389
Any luck on Mac yet?

11:00.495 --> 11:02.827
His landlady says she hasn't
seen him since early this morning.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.228
<i>But I got the place staked out,</i>

11:04.299 --> 11:06.733
he's probably at some
chopper chop shop somewhere.

11:06.801 --> 11:08.962
<i>Rick, we don't know for sure
that Mac took the chopper.</i>

11:09.070 --> 11:12.198
<i>Hey, will you quit defending him?
I'm not defending him exactly.</i>

11:12.273 --> 11:13.535
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

11:13.608 --> 11:15.576
This bum's conned us all
at least once.

11:15.710 --> 11:19.339
You better start realizing that this
isn't your good old honest friend Mac.

11:19.814 --> 11:21.338
<i>Thomas, the real Mac is dead.</i>

11:21.483 --> 11:22.916
And this Jim...
Jim Bonig.

11:23.051 --> 11:25.485
The point is that you've got
to quit letting him off so easy

11:25.553 --> 11:27.521
<i>just because he looks like
the old Mac, Thomas.</i>

11:27.655 --> 11:30.590
<i>I am not letting him off, but I still
don't think he could be connected</i>

11:30.658 --> 11:32.250
with an attempt on T.C.

11:32.327 --> 11:34.488
<i>Magnum, I've been trying
to reach you.</i>

11:34.596 --> 11:37.429
<i>You received a call from a
client who said that it was urgent</i>

11:37.499 --> 11:40.900
<i>that he reach you, a matter
of a long overdue fee.</i>

11:41.069 --> 11:43.264
<i>Therefore I referred him
to Island Hoppers.</i>

11:43.505 --> 11:46.941
<i>I trust the payment will be sufficient
to cover your outstanding indebtedness</i>

11:47.008 --> 11:49.943
<i>to Mr. Masters, including
upkeep on the Ferrari</i>

11:50.011 --> 11:51.273
<i>and maintenance on
the tennis court.</i>

11:51.346 --> 11:52.836
<i>And I...
I got call on all money.</i>

11:52.914 --> 11:54.211
Your tab's through the ceiling.

11:54.315 --> 11:56.112
Rick nobody owes me a fee.

11:56.284 --> 11:57.751
<i>Cut it out, Thomas,
Higgins just said...</i>

11:57.819 --> 11:59.286
<i>No, he didn't just say it.</i>

11:59.654 --> 12:03.488
<i>He must have left that message while T.C.
Was giving me my lesson, before the shooting.</i>

12:03.691 --> 12:05.784
He didn't mention the phone
call to you at the hospital?

12:05.860 --> 12:09.591
I don't think he thought it was
important. But maybe T.C. Was right.

12:09.731 --> 12:11.460
Maybe he was hit by mistake

12:11.633 --> 12:13.760
because he was sitting on
the right side of the chopper

12:13.835 --> 12:15.530
where the passenger
would normally be.

12:16.638 --> 12:17.627
You?

12:17.906 --> 12:21.433
Whoever made that call to Higgins
was probably the gunman looking for me

12:21.543 --> 12:23.135
and he got T.C. Instead.

12:23.845 --> 12:25.506
<i>You're right, Mr. Magnum.</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:38.549
We have to hurry.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.218
Valez's men probably know
you've come back here by now.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.352
Who's Valez?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.759
<i>Stop it, Mr. Magnum.</i>

12:43.863 --> 12:45.990
Everyone knows about
what you pulled off last week.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.624
You have to go back and tell
the truth. Now wait a minute.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.696
We're going back to Oklahoma?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.204
<i>You've got to be kidding. Just because
Thomas lied about being a pilot,</i>

12:53.272 --> 12:54.864
somebody's gotten bent
out of shape enough to...

12:54.974 --> 12:56.100
<i>All right, all right.</i>

13:16.763 --> 13:19.857
<i>Well, maybe now
I can get a simple thank you.</i>

13:20.366 --> 13:22.061
All I did was save your life.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.572
Most people put their house
keys with their car keys.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.672
<i>Well, I don't happen
to be most people.</i>

13:37.216 --> 13:39.241
But you should just be
thankful that I had to come back

13:39.318 --> 13:40.717
and get it and heard
what was going on.

13:40.853 --> 13:45.313
And that I had the presence of mind to
secure this from their glove compartment.

13:47.093 --> 13:50.460
<i>It's a shame we didn't have a little more
backup, we might have gotten the girl, too.</i>

13:50.530 --> 13:52.395
I was trying not to hit a lady.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.963
<i>Okay, fine. Look, who are you?</i>

13:55.435 --> 13:57.096
And where were you and
the girl trying to take us?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.611
<i>His name is Emilio,
and he's from Mexico City.</i>

14:10.716 --> 14:11.978
You speak Spanish?

14:12.351 --> 14:15.377
<i>Naturally, I speak Spanish. I studied
for the priesthood in Paraguay.</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:20.521
<i>Okay, so I was a dropout, but I
did attend a seminary... Never mind.</i>

14:21.160 --> 14:22.593
Ask him about the girl.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.635
What's he saying about me?

15:05.371 --> 15:06.770
And who's Pasqual Valez?

15:07.039 --> 15:08.529
You got to be kidding.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.338
He's only one of the biggest
crime bosses in Mexico City.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.509
<i>So you really got the goods on
Valez's organization last week, huh?</i>

15:16.148 --> 15:18.343
<i>Thomas, you were
in Mexico City last week?</i>

15:18.451 --> 15:20.180
I thought you were
in Oklahoma City.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.479
I was.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.447
You tell Emilio that
he's coming with me

15:25.591 --> 15:27.525
to find someone
who speaks Spanish.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.260
<i>Well, what do you
think I've been doing?</i>

15:29.395 --> 15:30.487
<i>I'm not sure, Mac.</i>

15:30.596 --> 15:33.497
That's why I like a second
opinion on what Emilio told you.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.532
Besides you've got something more
important to do. Find T.C.'s chopper.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.227
<i>Find it? Why, did he lose it?</i>

15:39.305 --> 15:41.364
<i>Knock it off, will you?
You know you stole it.</i>

15:41.507 --> 15:43.475
Me? Why is it always me?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.644
Why would I
liberate T.C.'s chopper?

15:45.711 --> 15:47.440
<i>I hate that word, too.</i>

15:47.647 --> 15:53.449
<i>Now, you bring back T.C.'s chopper
that you liberated, stole by tomorrow.</i>

15:59.425 --> 16:00.449
Island Hoppers.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.218
<i>Magnum, come home at once.</i>

16:02.295 --> 16:04.559
<i>Oh, Higgins. Look, you speak
Spanish, don't you?</i>

16:04.630 --> 16:06.097
I need you to do
some translating.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.395
<i>And I need you here,
now please hurry.</i>

16:08.701 --> 16:10.828
<i>Yes, do hurry, Mr. Magnum.</i>

16:11.437 --> 16:13.632
I will shoot Mr. Higgins
if I have to.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.468
<i>What do you want?
Follow my instructions.</i>

16:17.877 --> 16:19.344
<i>Bring Emilio here with you,</i>

16:19.946 --> 16:23.143
<i>do not call the police,
and come under concealment.</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:25.841
<i>You're a dead man
if Valez's men see you,</i>

16:26.319 --> 16:29.186
and so is your friend
Mr. Higgins if you cross me.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.855
No sign of a tail.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.024
Mac must have lost them for us.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.655
<i>Yeah, and I gotta find him.</i>

17:48.067 --> 17:51.798
<i>Rick, the best way to
guarantee that you'll see Mac</i>

17:51.904 --> 17:56.102
real soon is to have his car.
His life is in here.

17:58.110 --> 18:03.275
<i>Listen, Valez may have the estate
staked out... Wait a minute.</i>

18:06.452 --> 18:08.443
I don't believe this.
What?

18:08.621 --> 18:12.216
<i>Marvel Comics, volume one,
the first Tales from the Crypt,</i>

18:13.125 --> 18:15.116
<i>Huey, Dewey, and Louie
on Vacation...</i>

18:15.528 --> 18:17.758
All in good condition. Do
you know what these are worth?

18:17.997 --> 18:20.022
You better worry about
what your life is worth.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.937
<i>Okay, you'll lean on Mac about the
chopper when he gets back to T.C.'s office</i>

18:30.009 --> 18:32.773
and you'll check with
Ice Pick about Pasqual Valez.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.279
Thomas...
The lady said come alone.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.176
<i>Okay. Let's go, Emilio.</i>

18:59.138 --> 19:00.400
Emilio.
Maria?

19:00.506 --> 19:01.734
Magnum.
Higgins.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.344
Tea?

19:10.182 --> 19:12.047
You're supposed to be a hostage.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.080
Miss Torres has explained
why it was necessary for her

19:15.154 --> 19:17.748
to take such drastic action
to bring you here.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.418
<i>Magnum, why didn't you tell me
where you really were last week?</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:25.459
<i>Look, Miss Torres...</i>

19:27.867 --> 19:28.856
Maria.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.565
<i>I'm sorry that I had to leave
so quickly before,</i>

19:33.105 --> 19:37.337
<i>but it's most awkward for a federale
to be questioned by the American police.</i>

19:49.088 --> 19:51.716
You and Emilio
are Mexican agents?

19:52.158 --> 19:55.457
There's a plane arriving here in the
morning to take you to Mexico City

19:55.594 --> 19:57.824
if we can keep
you alive that long.

19:59.131 --> 20:02.567
We'll have to have your testimony
to nail Valez once and for all.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.198
Fine.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.977
But I want more than protection.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.940
What I know about Valez
goes to the highest bidder.

20:17.082 --> 20:18.515
We are the highest.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.077
How much?

20:21.153 --> 20:22.211
A lot.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.521
How'd you know about me?

20:25.324 --> 20:26.814
<i>And how did Valez?
As a matter of fact,</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:29.952
I pride myself on
being discreet.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.728
<i>Yes, you apparently
confided in no one.</i>

20:32.932 --> 20:34.797
<i>I'm sorry, Higgins,
this was too big.</i>

20:34.867 --> 20:38.200
<i>I used Oklahoma City as a cover,
I commuted to Mexico every day,</i>

20:38.270 --> 20:40.568
I used a fictitious name
with Valez's men.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.732
<i>Not according to
our sources, you didn't.</i>

20:42.808 --> 20:44.298
I used my real name?

20:44.376 --> 20:46.241
But claimed you
were from Chicago.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.804
<i>Naturally, it didn't take us,
or Valez, long to trace you here.</i>

20:51.817 --> 20:53.182
Naturally.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.552
<i>Higgins, ask Emilio</i>

20:58.757 --> 21:02.284
in Spanish what the guy
in T.C.'s office said to him.

21:14.173 --> 21:18.837
It seems Mac threatened to pour
gasoline in Emilio's navel and ignite it

21:18.978 --> 21:20.309
if Emilio didn't talk.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.907
I want to know if he asked
him anything about me.

21:34.827 --> 21:38.263
Mac asked if Emilio or Maria
had ever seen you.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.324
Have you? Maria?

21:44.503 --> 21:46.403
Can you swear I'm the man you're looking for?

21:47.239 --> 21:49.799
We know that a private
investigator named Thomas Magnum

21:49.875 --> 21:52.309
was working undercover
in the Valez family.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.145
What are you doing?

22:01.720 --> 22:04.245
I can straighten this out
with a couple of phone calls.

22:05.691 --> 22:06.885
The phone's dead.

22:08.894 --> 22:11.192
The security system
is being disabled.

22:12.531 --> 22:14.590
<i>Magnum,
someone's on the grounds.</i>

22:17.403 --> 22:18.563
Stay here.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.619
Valez.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.920
I tried to tell you.
Now it's too late.

23:04.332 --> 23:06.527
Any idea how many men
Valez brought with him?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.295
As many as it takes to kill you.

23:16.777 --> 23:17.766
Emilio.

23:18.779 --> 23:20.770
<i>Higgins, where are the dogs?</i>

23:20.848 --> 23:22.782
At the kennel for a grooming.

23:24.218 --> 23:25.207
Great.

23:25.753 --> 23:27.482
You picked today to
get them a haircut?

23:27.555 --> 23:31.082
I had no way of knowing that we would
be re-fighting the Alamo this afternoon.

23:31.158 --> 23:33.956
<i>Really, Magnum, you've no right
to involve the Robin Masters estate</i>

23:34.028 --> 23:36.019
in your clandestine affairs.
Higgins.

23:37.665 --> 23:39.428
I was in Oklahoma.

23:40.501 --> 23:42.992
No Valez. No Mexico.

23:43.237 --> 23:45.933
It will do no good for you to
try and change your story now.

23:46.006 --> 23:47.303
Maria's right.

23:47.641 --> 23:51.509
<i>Actually, I'm impressed that you'd attempt
to expose a South American mafia king...</i>

23:51.579 --> 23:52.841
I didn't.

23:53.214 --> 23:55.546
<i>As soon as I can get to a phone,
I'm going to call Oklahoma,</i>

23:55.616 --> 23:57.550
and they will verify
for you and Maria

23:57.718 --> 24:00.653
that I was there the entire week
discussing oil rig vandalism.

24:02.022 --> 24:03.284
They stopped shooting.

24:06.060 --> 24:07.891
What in God's name
are you doing?

24:07.962 --> 24:08.951
<i>Look,</i>

24:09.864 --> 24:13.925
we're gonna need a bunker to... So we
can see them entering from any direction.

24:14.402 --> 24:15.391
Emilio.

24:26.447 --> 24:28.847
The sixth century Vishnu
from the temple of Angkor

24:28.916 --> 24:32.181
and the Gauguin
deserve to survive.

24:55.476 --> 24:56.875
<i>Hey, where are you going?</i>

24:58.245 --> 24:59.678
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

25:00.281 --> 25:03.808
An O. Henry first edition
and Balzac was barely spared.

25:05.553 --> 25:07.851
You won't be spared
if you don't stay under cover.

25:07.922 --> 25:11.255
<i>Miss Torres, I assure you, I'm quite
capable of taking care of myself.</i>

25:11.625 --> 25:16.085
<i>Higgins, what happened to the ammo
for the guns in Robin's gun cabinet?</i>

25:16.263 --> 25:18.493
All ammunition was removed
to the garage last week for

25:18.566 --> 25:21.660
the Annual Home for Incorrigible
Boys Open House. Emilio.

25:21.735 --> 25:24.465
Why didn't you put it back
after the incorrigible boys left?

25:24.538 --> 25:26.836
Never mind. Where's the extra
rounds for the Webley?

25:26.974 --> 25:28.965
In the study. I'll fetch them. Look out!

25:35.049 --> 25:36.607
<i>Never mind,
they're in the house.</i>

26:14.021 --> 26:16.683
Someone must have heard the
shots and called the police.

26:17.224 --> 26:18.486
Emilio's dead.

26:21.328 --> 26:22.488
I'm sorry.

26:24.732 --> 26:26.825
We have to get out of here
before they arrive.

26:29.303 --> 26:34.502
<i>Higgins, look, I'm sorry
for dragging you into this.</i>

26:34.842 --> 26:38.403
<i>I'll tell the police about Valez, but until
we can prove it, you're still a target.</i>

26:38.479 --> 26:39.468
You'd better go.

26:41.615 --> 26:42.673
Thanks.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.833
Nothing except a battle lost

27:01.168 --> 27:03.898
can be half so melancholy
as a battle won.

27:09.944 --> 27:13.402
You picked a good place. Hardly
anyone ever comes out to this strip.

27:13.881 --> 27:16.441
Thanks.
I did my research.

27:17.117 --> 27:19.517
<i>If you're safe anywhere
right now, it's here.</i>

27:21.622 --> 27:24.853
Why do you make it sound like
I'm the only one in danger?

27:26.994 --> 27:28.222
Am I in danger?

27:31.966 --> 27:35.800
You are if Valez finds us and
we can't fight our way out.

27:38.672 --> 27:39.661
<i>Salud.</i>

27:46.347 --> 27:47.939
I hope pepperoni's okay.

27:48.315 --> 27:49.942
Is that the guy you called?

27:50.451 --> 27:52.385
That's a terrible joke.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.444
I am sorry.

27:55.956 --> 27:57.890
I try to make jokes
occasionally.

27:58.892 --> 28:01.417
So who did you call
when we stopped for the pizza?

28:01.662 --> 28:04.995
<i>A guy named Rick, who's trying
to reach a guy named Ice Pick,</i>

28:05.065 --> 28:08.296
who just might know
a guy named Valez.

28:09.203 --> 28:12.400
Whom you still think you just
might be able to deal with

28:12.506 --> 28:14.474
<i>for your information, and live.</i>

28:16.043 --> 28:18.341
<i>That plan failed
in Mexico City, remember?</i>

28:18.445 --> 28:19.935
I wasn't in Mexico City.

28:21.048 --> 28:24.074
I just want a chance to
try to convince Valez of that.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.620
I've always been
told it was messy.

28:29.156 --> 28:30.316
It is.

28:30.624 --> 28:31.716
You're kidding.

28:32.226 --> 28:33.557
You never had pizza?

28:35.295 --> 28:37.024
It just never appealed to me.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.928
No forks?

28:43.203 --> 28:45.103
<i>No, you don't need one.</i>

28:45.172 --> 28:47.106
<i>See, what you do here
is you just...</i>

28:48.842 --> 28:50.571
You gotta kind of curl it up.

29:00.020 --> 29:04.252
<i>You're right,
it is messy, sorry.</i>

29:05.225 --> 29:06.214
Mmm.

29:08.662 --> 29:09.993
<i>So, why do you do it?</i>

29:10.731 --> 29:13.666
Eat pizza? I'm a cheese freak.
No.

29:13.967 --> 29:17.903
Why do you do dangerous things
like go after big men like Valez.

29:19.440 --> 29:20.668
I don't.

29:21.608 --> 29:24.509
<i>You know, no one's ever worked their
way into his crime family before,</i>

29:25.612 --> 29:28.012
learned his best kept secrets
in a week.

29:29.049 --> 29:30.175
I didn't.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.075
<i>Okay, I didn't reach
the guy in Oklahoma,</i>

29:32.152 --> 29:34.017
<i>but I'll reach him tomorrow,
I'll prove it to you.</i>

29:34.288 --> 29:37.951
There's no time for phone calls. The
plane will be here right after dawn.

29:38.025 --> 29:39.458
I won't be getting on it.

29:43.464 --> 29:44.795
Where does it hurt?

29:47.301 --> 29:48.529
Let me see.

29:51.805 --> 29:52.794
Thanks.

29:54.007 --> 30:00.344
That's a result of my
encounter with your friend.

30:01.782 --> 30:03.215
My friend Emilio?

30:04.284 --> 30:05.273
It's okay.

30:06.687 --> 30:08.985
<i>He knew it could happen,
being a federale.</i>

30:14.328 --> 30:15.693
Why do you do it?

30:17.164 --> 30:19.155
Maybe one of these days I won't.

30:20.567 --> 30:22.762
Maybe I'll find something saner.

30:25.339 --> 30:26.328
Yeah?

30:29.343 --> 30:32.801
<i>If you did, what would you
do if you got out?</i>

30:35.315 --> 30:37.010
Just what you did.

30:41.622 --> 30:45.922
I don't go after any suspect
without checking out his background.

31:13.787 --> 31:15.482
<i>It's not going to work, Maria.</i>

31:17.457 --> 31:20.426
<i>No, not as
a permanent relationship,</i>

31:21.862 --> 31:24.296
but maybe we could just...
You know what I mean.

31:25.098 --> 31:26.793
I'm not going to Mexico.

31:29.837 --> 31:31.099
<i>I'm not either,</i>

31:35.075 --> 31:36.667
not until morning.

31:42.883 --> 31:44.783
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I reached Ice Pick.</i>

31:44.852 --> 31:48.549
<i>I'm gonna tell you, Thomas, he wasn't real
thrilled about being disturbed at 3:00 a. m.</i>

31:48.622 --> 31:50.317
What did he say about Valez?

31:50.457 --> 31:51.617
<i>He knows him.</i>

31:51.692 --> 31:54.889
But he can't help you except to tell
you that Valez flew in here yesterday.

31:55.062 --> 31:57.963
Ice Pick doesn't know where
he's staying on the island?

31:58.198 --> 31:59.597
<i>He doesn't want to know, Thomas.</i>

31:59.833 --> 32:03.394
Just forget about it. He said that
he won't deal with Valez for anybody.

32:03.503 --> 32:04.902
Did Mac meet up with you?

32:05.038 --> 32:06.198
<i>No, listen to this,</i>

32:06.406 --> 32:09.375
he called me at midnight to tell me
that he might have found T.C.'s chopper.

32:09.877 --> 32:12.175
<i>Rick, listen, see if you can
find him, it's important.</i>

32:12.279 --> 32:15.442
Tell him I'm flying out of Molani
Airport for Mexico in an hour.

32:15.682 --> 32:17.547
<i>You're not really going to
go there, are you?</i>

32:18.352 --> 32:22.015
That is up to Mac.
See what you can do. Okay.

32:22.990 --> 32:25.185
<i>Thomas? Hey, Thomas, Thomas!</i>

32:31.098 --> 32:33.566
Maria. Time to wake up.

32:34.868 --> 32:36.199
It's okay.

32:37.237 --> 32:38.568
I went to sleep.
It's okay.

32:38.672 --> 32:39.798
Your plane should be landing any minute now.

32:39.873 --> 32:41.397
I never sleep while I'm working.

32:41.575 --> 32:43.406
<i>Well, then I guess
you don't sleep much.</i>

32:43.577 --> 32:45.477
<i>Here, you want some coffee.
It's only an hour old.</i>

32:45.612 --> 32:46.704
You went out?

32:47.080 --> 32:49.105
<i>They could have seen you,
followed you here.</i>

32:49.249 --> 32:51.012
I had to check in
with my friend Rick.

32:54.054 --> 32:56.545
Looks like I'll be
looking for Valez myself.

33:00.460 --> 33:04.157
<i>Oh, will you put that down, I didn't
have to come back here, remember?</i>

33:04.598 --> 33:05.895
The point is you did.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.695
And you're
getting on that plane.

33:09.503 --> 33:13.496
<i>You don't really care whether I'm the
Magnum you're looking for or not, do you?</i>

33:13.707 --> 33:16.005
You're job is just
bring in the suspect.

33:16.076 --> 33:17.941
<i>If you have no information,
you'll be released.</i>

33:18.011 --> 33:20.343
<i>In what condition? Your people
will get a confession out of me,</i>

33:20.414 --> 33:22.507
<i>whether it's true or not,
and you know that.</i>

33:22.582 --> 33:24.573
You can't really believe
I'd let that happen.

33:26.853 --> 33:29.048
I don't know what
to believe about you.

33:32.693 --> 33:34.593
And last night
didn't change that.

33:35.696 --> 33:38.756
<i>People in your line of work can
have strange priorities, I know.</i>

33:43.070 --> 33:44.264
Magnum.

33:52.012 --> 33:53.673
Am I glad to see you!

33:54.247 --> 33:58.445
<i>Yeah, Mac, I knew you would
be naturally concerned.</i>

33:58.552 --> 34:01.077
That's why I was hoping Rick
would tell you where I was.

34:01.288 --> 34:03.779
<i>Oh, he told me
a lot more than that.</i>

34:04.458 --> 34:07.325
What's this crazy story about
you going to Mexico City?

34:08.228 --> 34:10.525
<i>No, Mac, I'm not going.
You are.</i>

34:10.864 --> 34:13.731
<i>Maria says the federales are
the highest bidder. Any price.</i>

34:14.034 --> 34:15.592
You should sell to her.

34:15.668 --> 34:16.897
Any price?

34:17.804 --> 34:19.465
If you had anything to sell.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.572
<i>Drugs, rackets, numbers...</i>

34:28.114 --> 34:30.743
I have names and places
that tie straight to Valez.

34:31.318 --> 34:32.978
I want a million cash.

34:33.453 --> 34:35.751
<i>Now your syndicate should
consider that a bargain,</i>

34:35.856 --> 34:38.347
considering that I'm removing
the opposition.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.726
<i>Magnum, she's no federale.</i>

34:47.667 --> 34:50.362
<i>Hey, I know what I'm talking about.
Why don't you ever believe me?</i>

34:50.603 --> 34:53.971
I believe you.
You'll get your million.

34:57.210 --> 34:59.508
<i>And you, I'm afraid,
have become expendable.</i>

35:05.419 --> 35:09.412
<i>Sorry, Thomas, I would have had
to have killed you sooner or later.</i>

35:23.270 --> 35:24.430
You're welcome.

35:35.631 --> 35:38.623
That pilot's bound to be with
the same outfit Maria worked for.

35:38.734 --> 35:40.167
A rival crime family.

35:40.803 --> 35:42.202
He's coming towards us.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.498
<i>You know, with what I had on Valez, they
could have turned him over to the federales.</i>

35:48.577 --> 35:51.512
<i>Why, Mac? Why did you
get me involved in this?</i>

35:51.647 --> 35:54.275
Can we discuss this
a little bit later?

35:54.349 --> 35:56.317
Right now we better worry
about this pilot.

36:07.863 --> 36:09.057
Valez.

36:09.131 --> 36:11.429
His men must have seen the
plane landing. Let's go.

36:39.361 --> 36:41.352
<i>Magnum, would you come on?</i>

36:54.810 --> 36:56.004
Mac...

36:57.846 --> 36:58.972
Mac!

37:06.622 --> 37:09.352
<i>Is this how Thomas Magnum
got into Valez's family,</i>

37:09.424 --> 37:11.392
as a Spanish-speaking pilot?

37:12.427 --> 37:14.088
I wasn't a pilot for them.

37:14.162 --> 37:16.460
<i>And I swear,
I never told Valez your name.</i>

37:16.532 --> 37:18.762
His men knew me as Trini Oliva.

37:19.368 --> 37:22.201
<i>The one time I did use your name,
is when I had to flash your license</i>

37:22.337 --> 37:23.998
to verify some facts
with the police.

37:24.506 --> 37:25.734
My license?

37:25.807 --> 37:27.035
Exactly.

37:28.176 --> 37:30.576
<i>And I think Valez's has some friends
down at the police department,</i>

37:30.646 --> 37:33.080
'cause they sure knew that
Trini Oliva

37:34.483 --> 37:37.350
was the same as Thomas Magnum
when they came here to kill me.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.477
<i>Kill me, can you beat that?</i>

37:40.889 --> 37:43.483
Hey! Valez told me he was coming alone.

37:43.725 --> 37:44.783
Mac!

37:58.273 --> 37:59.535
<i>Damn, I'm good.</i>

37:59.608 --> 38:03.874
<i>Didn't I tell you? If I hadn't burst
my eardrums, I'd still be a jet pilot.</i>

38:04.947 --> 38:06.244
<i>Why, Magnum... Oh.</i>

38:06.682 --> 38:09.776
<i>Why, Magnum, why don't
you ever believe me?</i>

38:09.851 --> 38:12.046
<i>Mac, what's wrong
with your side?</i>

38:13.021 --> 38:14.682
There's a bullet in it.

38:14.756 --> 38:15.745
What?

38:16.258 --> 38:17.657
There's a bullet in it.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.061
<i>Mac, get us on the ground.
You bet.</i>

38:21.129 --> 38:23.063
Just as soon as
we get to Mexico.

38:23.165 --> 38:24.393
Mexico?

38:25.000 --> 38:28.561
<i>Naturally, they gave us enough
gas in this bird to get us there.</i>

38:29.071 --> 38:31.733
<i>Well, Magnum, I just
want to do the right thing.</i>

38:31.873 --> 38:34.239
<i>I want to get these papers
to the federales.</i>

38:34.409 --> 38:36.309
<i>Besides, if we
stayed here any longer,</i>

38:36.378 --> 38:38.437
Valez and his men would
just keep coming after you.

38:38.513 --> 38:40.208
<i>Not with what you
have in that little book,</i>

38:40.282 --> 38:42.375
that's what I've been
needing to get him picked up.

38:42.451 --> 38:44.009
<i>Now, tell me where he's staying.</i>

38:44.519 --> 38:45.952
How would I know
where he's staying?

38:46.021 --> 38:47.818
Because you know
everything else about him.

38:47.889 --> 38:50.016
<i>Now give me the address,
you can't make it to Mexico.</i>

38:50.092 --> 38:51.855
Would you please
just look in the kit

38:51.927 --> 38:54.589
and see if you can find something
to help stop this bleeding.

38:58.734 --> 39:00.361
Peanut butter and jelly?

39:00.936 --> 39:02.130
And no medical supplies.

39:02.204 --> 39:05.196
<i>Mac, give me the address
and turn us around.</i>

39:06.174 --> 39:09.371
<i>Okay, it's 8630 Cranebrook.</i>

39:10.245 --> 39:12.941
<i>But, Magnum... Magnum,
listen, grab the wheel.</i>

39:13.015 --> 39:14.482
What?
Grab the wheel.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.843
<i>Now listen carefully,</i>

39:18.654 --> 39:21.748
<i>the plane's in trim, you
shouldn't have too much trouble.</i>

39:22.557 --> 39:24.354
Until you start down.

39:24.626 --> 39:25.923
Until I start down?

39:26.061 --> 39:30.691
<i>Now, listen,
turn the plane around.</i>

39:31.033 --> 39:32.022
How?

39:32.334 --> 39:34.359
You make a U-ie
to the right.

39:36.938 --> 39:37.927
Mac?

40:06.068 --> 40:08.332
<i>Okay, Tommy, don't panic.</i>

40:08.437 --> 40:11.702
<i>My name is Art and I'm a CAP
Pilot. We're going to get you down.</i>

40:12.307 --> 40:14.172
<i>Just don't panic, Tommy, okay?</i>

40:14.242 --> 40:16.676
It's Thomas.
And I'm not panicking.

40:17.012 --> 40:19.640
And I don't want to come down
until the police get that message.

40:19.715 --> 40:21.615
Check 3680 Cranebrook.

40:21.717 --> 40:22.843
<i>They've got it, Tommy.</i>

40:22.918 --> 40:24.510
<i>Thomas!
Check.</i>

40:24.753 --> 40:29.122
<i>We just find a little familiarity relaxes
people in life-threatening situations.</i>

40:31.460 --> 40:33.223
<i>Well, thanks, Arty.</i>

40:33.762 --> 40:35.662
Did you get ahold
of Rick Wright?

40:35.731 --> 40:39.690
<i>Check. He says that T.C. Cannot
get out of the hospital until later,</i>

40:39.868 --> 40:43.395
<i>and that Rick has sent
some other help. Now, listen,</i>

40:43.672 --> 40:46.971
you're gonna have to lose all
that extra fuel before you crash...

40:47.676 --> 40:49.439
<i>Before you land the craft.</i>

40:49.945 --> 40:54.143
<i>Well, you mean, I gotta fly around
here till the tanks are empty?</i>

40:54.216 --> 40:57.777
<i>Negative. Look for a fuel jettison
near those tanks in the back.</i>

40:59.020 --> 41:00.612
<i>Don't smoke, Magnum, please.</i>

41:00.722 --> 41:03.316
<i>And watch your
altimeter at all times.</i>

41:04.559 --> 41:06.959
Higgins?
You're the help Rick got?

41:07.028 --> 41:09.758
It's an instrument on your panel
that vaguely resembles a clock.

41:09.865 --> 41:12.629
<i>If the hand on the clock starts
spinning, you're losing altitude.</i>

41:12.701 --> 41:13.929
<i>Higgins, get off the mike.</i>

41:14.069 --> 41:18.005
I'm merely translating the pilot's
technical terms into Magnumese.

41:18.106 --> 41:20.404
<i>You're not a pilot!
I've had experience.</i>

41:20.575 --> 41:21.872
What experience?

41:22.043 --> 41:24.341
<i>I happen to be
a member of the Goldfish Club,</i>

41:24.446 --> 41:26.539
a group restricted
to those select few

41:26.615 --> 41:29.379
<i>who have jumped over 5,000
feet into ocean water.</i>

41:29.484 --> 41:31.213
What does that have
to do with flying?

41:31.319 --> 41:32.843
<i>In this instance, a great deal.</i>

41:32.921 --> 41:35.287
I suggest you check
the cockpit for a parachute.

41:35.423 --> 41:37.857
Art and I can instruct you
in a ditching procedure.

41:37.926 --> 41:39.985
<i>Now, that sounds like a good
idea to me, Tommy.</i>

41:40.228 --> 41:42.560
<i>Yes, Tommy,
look for a parachute.</i>

41:44.833 --> 41:48.269
<i>Look, yeah. Thomas. And there's
a couple of parachutes here,</i>

41:48.336 --> 41:50.065
but there's no way
I can get Mac into one.

41:50.138 --> 41:52.800
Check. Then let's start
dumping that gas.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.445
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

42:03.518 --> 42:05.782
<i>Six hours of flight instruction in a chopper</i>

42:05.854 --> 42:07.913
<i>does not make you
a fixed wing pilot.</i>

42:08.089 --> 42:09.647
<i>But I knew it could be done.</i>

42:09.758 --> 42:11.555
<i>Doris Day did it in Julie,</i>

42:11.726 --> 42:13.387
<i>Karen Black did it in Airport.</i>

42:13.495 --> 42:15.486
<i>Julie Hagerty did
it in Airplane!</i>

42:15.564 --> 42:17.896
<i>The question was, could I do it?</i>

42:18.066 --> 42:19.590
<i>After all, I wasn't a stewardess</i>

42:19.668 --> 42:22.694
<i>with a reassuring fatherly
voice talking me down.</i>

42:22.938 --> 42:26.499
<i>I was a guy. A guy, who T.C.
Said had no talent for flying,</i>

42:26.575 --> 42:30.067
<i>being talked in by Higgins,
describing spinning clocks.</i>

42:30.312 --> 42:32.507
<i>I just had to hope that
you didn't have to be a female</i>

42:32.581 --> 42:34.310
<i>to land a plane
on your first try.</i>

42:34.449 --> 42:36.246
<i>And that Art
could out-talk Higgins.</i>

42:36.351 --> 42:38.842
<i>You made that bank
like a pro, Thomas.</i>

42:39.354 --> 42:41.151
<i>How's your altimeter?</i>

42:41.523 --> 42:42.717
<i>I'm at 2,000.</i>

42:42.824 --> 42:44.519
<i>And you're steady?
Check.</i>

42:44.726 --> 42:47.820
<i>That's incredible. Are you
sure you haven't flown before?</i>

42:48.797 --> 42:50.924
No. I guess it's
just natural talent.

42:51.066 --> 42:53.057
<i>Okay, you're on final approach.</i>

42:53.134 --> 42:54.328
<i>Now, listen up.</i>

42:54.436 --> 42:59.203
<i>One final thought on Doris, Karen,
Julie and expanding one's horizons.</i>

42:59.307 --> 43:00.968
<i>Life can imitate art,</i>

43:01.042 --> 43:03.567
<i>and what the girls did
in artful film fashion,</i>

43:03.678 --> 43:05.805
<i>Art was helping me do
in real life.</i>

43:05.914 --> 43:08.712
<i>As for horizons,
life's full of choices.</i>

43:09.384 --> 43:11.716
<i>I decided if I got
on the ground again,</i>

43:11.853 --> 43:14.185
<i>I'd give up my idea
of becoming a pilot.</i>

43:14.522 --> 43:16.752
<i>Now I had one more
choice to make,</i>

43:16.825 --> 43:19.988
<i>be an instant Lindbergh
or be in several pieces.</i>

43:20.128 --> 43:23.894
<i>Down, Thomas, push down, gently.</i>

43:24.366 --> 43:26.732
<i>You're not listening.
I said push down.</i>

43:38.380 --> 43:41.008
<i>He made it.
He actually landed.</i>

43:44.853 --> 43:46.013
Mac!

43:46.321 --> 43:49.984
<i>Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Hooray!</i>

43:50.058 --> 43:52.219
<i>Hip, hip, hooray!</i>

44:01.202 --> 44:03.500
Wait a minute.
Where's the brakes?

44:04.806 --> 44:08.037
<i>Guys? Arty?</i>

44:08.243 --> 44:11.235
<i>Higgins? Come on,
where's the brakes?</i>

44:12.047 --> 44:15.483
<i>Will you please tell me
where are the brakes? Higgins!</i>

44:23.391 --> 44:26.258
I wanted to talk to you
guys before I saw the priest.

44:27.529 --> 44:30.498
To get some things off my
chest while there's still time.

44:30.999 --> 44:33.627
<i>Mac, please.
No. No, no, listen.</i>

44:35.470 --> 44:39.964
<i>I slipped into Magnum's place,
and I secured his P.I. License,</i>

44:41.376 --> 44:43.071
and I had it duplicated

44:43.645 --> 44:45.943
and that's how his name
got mixed up in all of this.

44:46.481 --> 44:50.110
But it was worth it
because I nailed Valez.

44:50.752 --> 44:52.549
Thomas nailed Valez.

44:53.588 --> 44:56.716
<i>Exactly. T. C.,
I wanted to tell you that</i>

44:57.859 --> 45:01.260
the guy I leased your chopper
to knew from the beginning

45:01.329 --> 45:02.853
that you were going to get
six percent.

45:03.064 --> 45:04.190
<i>Thanks, Mac.</i>

45:05.200 --> 45:09.034
<i>But since you won't be with us much
longer, I've drawn up these papers</i>

45:10.572 --> 45:14.440
<i>signing me over your car, your
checking account, to cover my troubles</i>

45:14.542 --> 45:16.339
and the shooting up of my van.

45:17.145 --> 45:19.739
All right. No problem.

45:20.682 --> 45:22.980
I'll sign these
when I get my strength back.

45:23.184 --> 45:25.618
<i>Perhaps you aren't going to
get any stronger, Mac.</i>

45:26.021 --> 45:27.716
Best that you sign it now.

45:27.956 --> 45:29.321
<i>Rick has one, as well.</i>

45:30.992 --> 45:32.960
You'll be leaving me
your life's savings.

45:33.028 --> 45:34.996
<i>I checked the account and
there's only about 25 bucks in it,</i>

45:35.096 --> 45:37.360
<i>but it will take care of all
my troubles, not only that, Mac,</i>

45:38.099 --> 45:40.363
it will give me something
to remember you by.

45:51.079 --> 45:52.478
<i>Try again, Mac.</i>

45:53.048 --> 45:54.811
You should be getting stronger.

46:00.055 --> 46:02.853
<i>See, I talked to your
doctor this morning,</i>

46:03.258 --> 46:05.351
<i>he said you did have
a close call,</i>

46:05.693 --> 46:08.992
but you should be up and
around by the end of the week.

46:09.064 --> 46:10.395
Hasn't he told you that?

46:14.836 --> 46:17.168
<i>Mac gave me
something, too, guys.</i>

46:17.806 --> 46:20.673
What did you get?
My life insurance? My mother?

46:20.842 --> 46:21.831
<i>No, Mac.</i>

46:22.243 --> 46:23.505
Your comic books.

46:23.812 --> 46:25.973
<i>Doesn't even the score,
but it's a start.</i>

46:26.247 --> 46:27.771
What do you mean
it doesn't even the score?

46:27.882 --> 46:29.372
Some of those were
worth a fortune.

46:29.551 --> 46:32.315
<i>I know Huey, Dewey and Louie
on Vacation</i>

46:32.420 --> 46:33.580
<i>and Tales from the Crypt are,</i>

46:33.655 --> 46:36.715
so maybe I'll feel different when
I go through the rest of the box.

46:37.826 --> 46:41.660
<i>Magnum, are you referring
to the duck and monster books</i>

46:41.729 --> 46:43.959
I found in the trunk
of Mac's car?

46:44.966 --> 46:48.902
<i>Yes, they were
extremely valuable.</i>

46:49.304 --> 46:50.396
Were?

46:50.672 --> 46:54.335
<i>Yes, they paid half the cost
of an O. Henry first edition.</i>

46:55.110 --> 46:58.307
<i>Naturally, I knew you'd want to
contribute to the estate damages.</i>

47:01.616 --> 47:02.810
Naturally.

47:03.952 --> 47:05.249
Naturally.

47:07.689 --> 47:09.156
I hate that word.
