WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:03.716
a three-way trade
between Ruxin, Kevin

00:03.836 --> 00:05.002
and the Coin.

00:05.087 --> 00:06.670
Ruxin gives Jarvis
Landry to Kevin...

00:06.756 --> 00:08.305
Yes.
...Kevin gives Mark Ingram

00:08.340 --> 00:09.723
to the Coin

00:09.809 --> 00:11.009
and to Ruxin the Coin gives...

00:11.010 --> 00:12.593
Cam Newton.
Cam Newton.

00:12.678 --> 00:13.894
Here we go.

00:13.979 --> 00:16.680
And the Coin accepts those terms.
Great.

00:16.732 --> 00:17.981
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:18.017 --> 00:19.650
<i>Hola.</i>

00:19.685 --> 00:20.734
<i>¿Qué?</i>

00:20.820 --> 00:22.069
I can't understand you.

00:22.154 --> 00:23.854
Call back later, bye.

00:23.906 --> 00:26.073
Sofia's mom.

00:26.158 --> 00:27.357
Okay, I'll put all the details
in an e-mail

00:27.410 --> 00:28.325
and send it to you guys,

00:28.360 --> 00:29.359
but first, I want to make sure

00:29.412 --> 00:30.360
that you're not gonna welch.

00:30.413 --> 00:31.912
I don't welch on deals.

00:31.997 --> 00:32.996
You welch, Ruxin!

00:33.032 --> 00:34.153
You're a prodigious welcher.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.199
That is not true.

00:36.335 --> 00:38.118
Coin says,
"Totally true."

00:38.204 --> 00:39.503
'Cause the Coin knows.

00:39.538 --> 00:40.537
Thank you very much,

00:40.589 --> 00:41.922
my good man.

00:42.007 --> 00:43.173
He got us a reservation
at Rajasthan.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.875
This place isn't even open yet,

00:44.927 --> 00:46.176
and they're booked
for two months.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.544
Yeah. By the time it's open,

00:47.596 --> 00:49.379
Sofia will be home
and we can go out together

00:49.432 --> 00:51.181
and celebrate
her refurbished downstairs.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.350
Oh, I guess
we're telling people now.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.219
Telling everyone. It's so cool.

00:55.271 --> 00:56.687
You know, I'm still kind of pissed

00:56.722 --> 00:58.138
that she didn't come to me, right?
What?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.273
<i>Hola.</i>
'Cause she isn't creepy.

00:59.358 --> 01:00.557
I'm not a
creep, I'm a doctor.

01:00.609 --> 01:02.359
Would you want anyone...
I can't hear you.

01:02.394 --> 01:03.560
Bye-bye.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.194
All I'm saying is,
when you come to me,

01:05.230 --> 01:06.991
I don't make a judgment
about your lifestyle,

01:07.032 --> 01:08.198
I just support...
Oh, my God. I know.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.900
You could always work on Jenny.

01:09.952 --> 01:11.485
Or, if you wanted
to make Kevin really happy,

01:11.570 --> 01:13.570
you could fix Pete's little calamari.
Okay.

01:13.656 --> 01:14.538
I'd do it.

01:14.573 --> 01:15.906
- What?
- No judgment.

01:15.991 --> 01:17.291
Oh, Jesus, she's texting me now.
I'm a professional...

01:22.915 --> 01:25.549
...really cool technology
from Japan right now...

01:25.584 --> 01:27.984
Ruxin, where are you going?
Yeah, you left your phone.

01:33.031 --> 01:39.195

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:40.933 --> 01:41.815
Ruxin?

01:41.901 --> 01:43.600
Hey, Ruxin?

01:43.652 --> 01:45.152
Coming in, buddy.

01:45.237 --> 01:46.270
Hey.

01:46.322 --> 01:47.738
We tried to call you
all night last night.

01:47.773 --> 01:49.273
Hey, how you doing?

01:50.693 --> 01:51.608
Oh, boy.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.694
What happened?

01:53.779 --> 01:55.863
She went in for
her mommy makeover procedure

01:55.948 --> 01:58.365
and she...

01:58.450 --> 02:00.951
she never...

02:01.036 --> 02:02.286
she never came out.

02:02.338 --> 02:03.670
Oh, my gosh.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.455
She was just trying
to tighten herself up for you

02:05.508 --> 02:08.041
and she just slipped away.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.293
What a tragedy.

02:09.345 --> 02:10.961
I mean, she was so hot.

02:11.045 --> 02:12.796
I'll never find anybody better.

02:12.848 --> 02:13.797
Oh, no.

02:13.849 --> 02:14.798
That's for sure.

02:14.850 --> 02:15.966
I mean, look at you.

02:16.018 --> 02:17.351
You've got those
little beady eyes

02:17.436 --> 02:19.116
- and scowly mouth...
- Okay. All right.

02:19.138 --> 02:21.138
Okay, man, just... be strong.

02:21.190 --> 02:23.056
Enough.

02:23.142 --> 02:25.225
Hey.

02:25.311 --> 02:28.195
I know you feel
like you're alone,

02:28.280 --> 02:29.646
but we're all here
to support you.

02:29.698 --> 02:32.566
That's why I made you
this condolence hummus.

02:34.069 --> 02:36.486
My own tears are mixed
in with the cumin.

02:36.539 --> 02:38.705
You know, just leave
it out as a snack,

02:38.791 --> 02:40.824
and when you dip
your little carrot stick in,

02:40.910 --> 02:43.293
think of me as that hummus,

02:43.329 --> 02:44.711
filling you up

02:44.797 --> 02:46.163
and holding you tight
from the inside.

02:46.248 --> 02:48.832
I don't even have
the mental wherewithal

02:48.918 --> 02:50.500
to make a gay joke out of this.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.753
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.671
Just choose one
and then shuffle on.

02:56.058 --> 02:56.974
You know,

02:57.009 --> 02:58.892
if Sofia came to me...

02:58.978 --> 02:59.478
Andre, stop.

02:59.511 --> 03:01.478
All right.

03:01.513 --> 03:02.429
Number one in Chicago.

03:02.514 --> 03:04.264
I'm just saying.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.983
I got that for a reason...
Enough.

03:06.018 --> 03:07.317
Guys, I just want
you to know that,

03:07.353 --> 03:08.936
as stupid and misguided

03:09.021 --> 03:11.321
as your attempts are
to make me feel better,

03:11.357 --> 03:13.607
I really appreciate you guys
being here right now.

03:13.692 --> 03:16.159
And I'm embarrassed to say this,

03:16.195 --> 03:18.695
but I don't think I can
set my lineup this week.

03:18.747 --> 03:20.581
Don't worry about that.
Oh, Ruxin, don't even think

03:20.666 --> 03:22.199
about that right now.
No problem.

03:22.284 --> 03:23.951
So... I guess

03:24.036 --> 03:25.452
I'll just, like,

03:25.537 --> 03:28.038
take a win this week and then

03:28.090 --> 03:29.762
we can go from there next week?

03:30.298 --> 03:31.806
I'm gonna go take a shower.

03:32.055 --> 03:32.960
Yeah. No, do that.

03:33.045 --> 03:33.927
Yeah.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.800
Uh...

03:39.885 --> 03:41.551
Did he say give him a win?

03:41.604 --> 03:43.387
Yeah. I mean...

03:43.472 --> 03:45.722
is that sufficient grounds
to give him a win?

03:45.774 --> 03:47.557
Do we have to do this?

03:47.610 --> 03:48.609
Peter!

03:48.694 --> 03:50.143
The guy just lost his wife.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.979
You're saying that because
you're playing him this week.

03:52.064 --> 03:54.064
Am I?
I didn't realize...

03:54.149 --> 03:55.532
That being said,

03:55.567 --> 03:57.951
how many weeks would
we give him wins?

03:58.037 --> 03:59.036
Uh, why do you ask, Jenny?
Is that because

03:59.071 --> 04:00.070
you're playing him next week?

04:00.155 --> 04:02.122
Guys, listen to me, okay?
This is about

04:02.207 --> 04:04.207
taking as much crap off
Ruxin's plate as possible,

04:04.243 --> 04:05.459
like that stupid trade

04:05.544 --> 04:07.077
the Coin made me do
that I don't want to do

04:07.129 --> 04:08.161
and now I'm not gonna do it.
What?

04:08.247 --> 04:08.962
You're welching.

04:09.048 --> 04:09.997
No, I'm thinking about

04:10.082 --> 04:11.164
my friend whose wife just died.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.416
Look, guys, real quick,
before he comes back,

04:12.501 --> 04:14.084
I don't mean to be callous here,

04:14.169 --> 04:18.088
but how certain are we
that he's not...

04:18.140 --> 04:19.923
making this up?

04:19.975 --> 04:21.841
Are you saying he's using
sympathy to eke out some wins?

04:21.927 --> 04:23.760
I mean, think about it.
Wouldn't you?

04:23.812 --> 04:25.178
To win the whole thing?
Kevin!

04:25.264 --> 04:27.097
No. No, I would never do that.

04:27.149 --> 04:29.433
Oh, she's gone!

04:29.485 --> 04:30.600
Oh, Tall Guy!

04:30.686 --> 04:31.652
Oh, she's gone.

04:31.737 --> 04:33.320
She's in Heaven, Tall Guy.

04:33.405 --> 04:35.439
I made some hummus.
Oh.

04:35.524 --> 04:37.190
That looks delicious.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.158
Yeah, it is.

04:38.243 --> 04:39.526
I just don't think

04:39.611 --> 04:40.827
I could have sex
with food right now.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.245
I'm so sad.

04:42.281 --> 04:43.246
Okay.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.948
Oh, wait, where's Ruxin?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.249
He's in the shower.
Shower.

04:46.285 --> 04:47.367
He's in the shower?

04:47.453 --> 04:48.618
Okay.

04:48.671 --> 04:50.087
I'm coming, Ruxin!

04:50.122 --> 04:50.954
No, no. No...
No.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.422
I'll be right there!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.207
We can grieve her together!

04:55.294 --> 04:56.615
What are you
doing in here?

04:56.628 --> 04:57.761
Do you have a boner?

04:57.796 --> 04:58.762
It's a grief boner.

04:58.797 --> 05:00.213
Oh...

05:00.299 --> 05:03.016
<i>Now, if I were you,</i>

05:03.102 --> 05:05.218
this is the one I would choose,

05:05.304 --> 05:07.804
the 20-gauge
silver hammertone.

05:07.856 --> 05:10.140
It's $990.

05:10.192 --> 05:11.892
I'm just gonna
stop this right now

05:11.977 --> 05:13.310
and tell you there is no body.

05:13.395 --> 05:14.611
What do you mean,
there's no body?

05:14.646 --> 05:17.030
Sofia's <i> papi</i> won't turn over

05:17.116 --> 05:18.482
her body to me,

05:18.534 --> 05:20.784
so we are going to have
an empty coffin.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.569
I want a simple, wooden coffin.

05:22.654 --> 05:24.488
All right?

05:24.573 --> 05:25.956
Lunchtime.
What?

05:25.991 --> 05:27.824
It's time for my sandwich
and banana.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.660
Can we just finish this coffin...
My sandwich and banana.

05:30.746 --> 05:31.878
We're in the middle
of something here, sir.

05:31.964 --> 05:33.246
Lunchtime only comes once a day.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.331
Is that a lunch box?

05:34.383 --> 05:36.333
Good luck with your wife.

05:36.418 --> 05:37.634
Wow.

05:37.669 --> 05:39.052
What is going on here?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.303
I'm sorry.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.979
This... this whole thing's
gotta be rough.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.424
And look,
the last time we spoke,

05:44.510 --> 05:45.926
we talked about that trade?

05:46.011 --> 05:47.644
Don't even worry about that.
Put that out of your mind.

05:47.679 --> 05:49.513
No, I'm not gonna welch
on the deal.

05:49.598 --> 05:50.597
No, you can welch.

05:50.682 --> 05:52.349
You have carte welch privileges.

05:52.434 --> 05:53.734
Look, I don't want
any special treatment

05:53.819 --> 05:55.902
from you guys right now.
Okay.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.571
You know, besides the win
that you already gave me.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.689
I don't need anything more.
Right.

05:59.775 --> 06:03.527
And if you see me adding or
dropping on the waiver wire,

06:03.612 --> 06:05.612
know that I do it
with a heavy heart.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.364
Of course.

06:07.449 --> 06:08.999
Sorry I'm late.
You guys didn't tell me

06:09.034 --> 06:10.500
where you were gonna go,
so I had to use the GPS tracker

06:10.536 --> 06:12.202
I have in Brian's car.

06:12.254 --> 06:14.504
Heard that Papi
won't let the body go.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.372
No! Can you talk to him?

06:15.424 --> 06:16.373
Are you kidding?

06:16.458 --> 06:17.457
Last time we talked,

06:17.543 --> 06:18.508
he stabbed me on the street

06:18.544 --> 06:19.593
and left me for dead.

06:19.678 --> 06:21.094
I just want to bury my wife.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.179
I get it, man.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.047
We loved her.
We want to be able

06:24.099 --> 06:25.766
to put her into the ground
for the rest of time.

06:25.851 --> 06:27.517
That being said,

06:27.553 --> 06:30.053
we could bury something that was
the weight of your wife.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.555
What do you think she is,

06:31.640 --> 06:33.056
two German Shepherds
and a Shih Tzu?

06:33.108 --> 06:34.474
She's lighter than that.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.060
I would honestly say
a German Shepherd,

06:37.146 --> 06:38.478
a Boxer and a Shih Tzu.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.063
I feel like she's
a German Shepherd,

06:40.149 --> 06:41.782
a Boxer and three dead cats.

06:41.867 --> 06:42.732
How dare you?

06:42.818 --> 06:44.151
You don't think I know

06:44.236 --> 06:45.902
how much my wife weighs
in dead animals?

06:45.954 --> 06:47.571
Guys, guys, she's a half
a Beethoven and a Taco Bell dog.

06:47.623 --> 06:48.623
Let's just put it to bed.

06:48.657 --> 06:49.990
Oh, come on, Brian!

06:50.075 --> 06:51.908
I can't get my hands on
celebrity dogs by tomorrow!

06:51.994 --> 06:53.877
We need to kill local dogs!

06:53.912 --> 06:55.162
Jesus.

06:55.247 --> 06:57.247
How am I supposed
to have a funeral with no body?

06:57.332 --> 06:59.132
Is there anything
you can do, Rafi?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.250
I'll talk to him.

07:00.302 --> 07:01.251
I'll see what I can do.

07:01.303 --> 07:02.419
But in the meantime,

07:02.471 --> 07:03.592
I'm gonna get Sofia's weight

07:03.672 --> 07:05.823
in dead animals just in case.

07:12.552 --> 07:14.385
It's just so weird, right?

07:14.470 --> 07:15.875
I know, having a casket
with no body in it?

07:15.991 --> 07:17.107
Ooh, water.

07:17.192 --> 07:19.192
No, it's not water...

07:19.278 --> 07:20.327
Taco.

07:20.362 --> 07:22.112
Mmm.
Bleh.

07:22.197 --> 07:23.780
Tastes like pennies.

07:23.865 --> 07:25.745
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the life

07:25.784 --> 07:27.422
of Sofia Ruxin.

07:27.643 --> 07:29.760
She was a caring wife

07:29.812 --> 07:31.929
and a doting mother,

07:32.014 --> 07:33.597
but perhaps she will
be most missed

07:33.683 --> 07:35.265
by her husband, Rodney,

07:35.351 --> 07:37.918
who would now like to say
a few words.

07:38.738 --> 07:39.937
No. Stop it.

07:40.022 --> 07:41.405
I just don't know when
to clap at these things.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.740
Never. Never clap at a funeral.

07:42.775 --> 07:44.024
He's gonna give a speech.

07:44.110 --> 07:44.908
Your friend's
wife just died.

07:44.944 --> 07:45.943
Thanks.

07:48.497 --> 07:51.580
Everyone calls me Ruxin.

07:53.279 --> 07:54.479
Except Sofia.

07:54.531 --> 07:56.314
She could call me Rodney.

07:56.366 --> 08:01.152
And I let her because
she was... so hot.

08:01.204 --> 08:03.654
He's right, she was fine.

08:03.707 --> 08:05.990
And she was so beautiful,
this is such a tragedy.

08:06.076 --> 08:09.794
The very first time
that she had any work done...

08:09.829 --> 08:13.164
Oh, please, that girl has
been to "Puerto Rico" before.

08:13.216 --> 08:14.382
It was the first time, okay?

08:14.467 --> 08:16.300
But I don't want to focus
on that right now.

08:16.336 --> 08:18.002
I want to focus
on the better times,

08:18.088 --> 08:22.006
the times I spent
in love with my wife.

08:22.058 --> 08:24.642
Love... is a journey.

08:24.677 --> 08:26.310
Wow.
Love is a battlefield.

08:26.346 --> 08:28.346
And I want to ride it
This just puts everything in perspective.

08:28.398 --> 08:29.598
all night long.
Oh, sweetheart.

08:29.682 --> 08:30.898
It's gonna be all right.

08:30.984 --> 08:31.933
No, it's not, I...

08:32.018 --> 08:33.351
I can't go through
with the trade.

08:33.403 --> 08:34.652
What?
I can't.

08:34.687 --> 08:35.986
Nothing inside me says to do it.

08:36.022 --> 08:37.020
I have to just...

08:37.107 --> 08:39.407
Kevin, you have to.

08:39.491 --> 08:40.357
What are you doing?
It doesn't matter.

08:40.409 --> 08:41.692
I'm not trading with him.

08:41.778 --> 08:42.827
It's over.

08:42.861 --> 08:44.195
Love is, uh...

08:46.666 --> 08:50.251
Love has been rejected?

08:50.336 --> 08:52.036
Why would you reject love?!

08:52.088 --> 08:53.755
Huh?!

08:53.840 --> 08:57.041
Everybody works so hard
on getting love to happen,

08:57.127 --> 08:58.926
and then you reject it.

08:59.012 --> 09:01.929
Why have you rejected love?!

09:02.015 --> 09:04.549
God, why...?!

09:04.634 --> 09:07.685
Why has everything forsaken me?!

09:07.720 --> 09:12.190
Why is my life so much harder
than everybody else's?!

09:12.225 --> 09:15.226
Why have you cheated me
this way, God?!

09:15.278 --> 09:17.111
Hey, buddy.

09:17.197 --> 09:18.446
Hey, everything's
gonna be all right.

09:18.531 --> 09:20.448
Hey, sexy, get him out of here.

09:23.903 --> 09:25.153
Some pretty intense words,

09:25.238 --> 09:28.039
spoken by my brother-in-law
and third best friend,

09:28.074 --> 09:30.208
whose name I just
found out is Rodney.

09:30.243 --> 09:32.126
Sofia was...

09:32.212 --> 09:33.744
Why?
in many ways, my better half.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.213
Why would you do this to me?

09:35.248 --> 09:36.631
I didn't feel good about it.

09:36.716 --> 09:38.916
I prepared some words...
to say...

09:38.968 --> 09:42.253
on this occasion.

09:43.673 --> 09:45.840
This is harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

09:45.925 --> 09:48.676
For those of you who don't
know me, I'm Rafi, I'm the...

09:48.761 --> 09:50.094
Stop it.
What? What?

09:50.180 --> 09:51.145
Thank you, Andre.

09:51.231 --> 09:52.396
See, he appreciated it.

09:52.432 --> 09:54.682
I'm the, uh, brother-lover
of the deceased.

09:54.767 --> 09:57.268
None of us are prepared
for this kind of loss,

09:57.320 --> 10:01.522
the loss of someone
so young, so beautiful,

10:01.608 --> 10:04.025
so tender and supple.

10:05.778 --> 10:07.361
When I realized
she was really dead

10:07.447 --> 10:11.282
and that she wasn't gonna
come back as, uh, a zombie

10:11.367 --> 10:12.783
or something cool like that,

10:12.836 --> 10:15.369
I was devastated.

10:15.455 --> 10:20.007
I was struggling
to keep my head above water.

10:20.093 --> 10:24.795
So I reached out to the smartest
man I've ever met,

10:24.848 --> 10:28.065
<i>'cause I knew he would</i>
<i>know what to do--</i>

10:28.134 --> 10:29.333
<i>Dirty Randy.</i>

10:35.141 --> 10:36.107
Randy.

10:36.175 --> 10:37.041
Yo, Raf.
Hey.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.342
What's happening, man?

10:38.411 --> 10:39.844
Bad news.

10:39.913 --> 10:41.612
Are these bees not bugging you at all?
No.

10:41.681 --> 10:42.747
Bees only sting women
on their periods.

10:42.815 --> 10:43.814
Everybody knows that.

10:43.883 --> 10:44.882
What are you doing here?

10:44.951 --> 10:46.552
Dude, I need your help
finding my sister.

10:46.553 --> 10:47.485
Anywhere, anytime.

10:47.554 --> 10:49.186
She's dead, man.
Okay.

10:49.255 --> 10:52.023
I assume this means you killed
her while making love to her.

10:52.091 --> 10:53.491
Don't worry, I got my Robert
Durst go-bag ready to go.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.393
No, no, we don't...
Let's do this!

10:55.461 --> 10:57.061
We don't need Bobby D's bag, okay?
Let's move, move, move. Are you sure?

10:57.130 --> 10:58.462
She died in Puerto Rico.

10:58.531 --> 11:00.398
I wasn't even
in the country, man.

11:00.466 --> 11:01.799
Weird.

11:01.868 --> 11:04.268
We don't have to cut her up into
tiny pieces like we planned.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.304
Okay, good, but I have the saw.
Awesome.

11:06.372 --> 11:08.940
I did not pay Robert Durst
$90 for that go-bag...

11:09.008 --> 11:10.141
and not negotiate a saw.

11:10.209 --> 11:12.043
Okay, so what do we do?

11:12.111 --> 11:13.177
First things first, man,

11:13.246 --> 11:14.979
we need to get her body
back to Chicago.

11:15.048 --> 11:17.014
And if we need to get her soul
back from the netherworld,

11:17.083 --> 11:18.549
I know a really good
necromancer.

11:18.618 --> 11:19.650
So this is the plan.
Yeah.

11:19.719 --> 11:20.985
We're gonna go to Puerto Rico,

11:21.054 --> 11:23.387
we're gonna get her body,
bring it back to Chicago,

11:23.456 --> 11:25.723
so she can be buried
by the man she loves.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.992
And also her husband,
Rodney Ruxin.

11:28.061 --> 11:30.361
Whoa, whoa, she was married?
Yes.

11:30.430 --> 11:33.931
Man, I said some incredibly
inappropriate things to her.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.500
And her husband was Jewish.

11:36.569 --> 11:38.169
What?!
I know.

11:38.237 --> 11:39.437
I heard they chew
on your shoelaces.

11:39.505 --> 11:41.172
Uh, I think that's goats.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.273
Okay, good. Okay.
Yeah.

11:42.342 --> 11:44.175
Hey, check this out.

11:44.243 --> 11:46.811
Oh, my God.

11:46.879 --> 11:47.778
What is that?

11:47.847 --> 11:48.813
Bee pubes, bro.

11:48.881 --> 11:50.448
Dude, that's amazing.

11:50.516 --> 11:51.549
I know, right?

11:51.618 --> 11:52.539
It's a pubic bee beard.

11:52.552 --> 11:53.484
It's a pubic beard of bees.

11:53.553 --> 11:54.485
Touché.

11:54.554 --> 11:55.653
How does it feel?

11:55.722 --> 11:57.355
It feels like when I had
crabs, only bigger.

11:57.423 --> 11:59.323
A few of them are crawling
into your pee hole, I think.

11:59.392 --> 12:01.692
I bet I can fit, like,
12 bees in my urethra.

12:01.761 --> 12:03.461
I bet I can fit 14 in mine.

12:03.529 --> 12:05.096
So let me ask you,
brother, are you in?

12:05.148 --> 12:07.698
Looks like Randy and Rafi
are going to Puerto Rico

12:07.767 --> 12:09.800
to steal a lady's corpse.

12:09.869 --> 12:11.102
Ow!

12:11.170 --> 12:12.370
Ow! Ow!

12:12.438 --> 12:13.337
Oh, hang on, I got the smoker.

12:13.406 --> 12:14.538
I'll calm 'em down.

12:14.607 --> 12:16.173
No, no, no!
That's steamed bath salts.

12:16.242 --> 12:17.675
That will only make them more
angry and cannibalistic.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.660
Oh, no, why am I not stopping?!

12:19.746 --> 12:20.678
Stop pumping it!

12:20.747 --> 12:21.747
Why do I keep pumping it?!

12:21.748 --> 12:22.663
Aah!

12:22.749 --> 12:24.332
Yeah!
Get out of here!

12:24.417 --> 12:25.967
Bees, follow us!

12:28.221 --> 12:31.555
<i> Dude, this is</i>
<i>the best way to travel.</i>

12:31.591 --> 12:34.458
<i>This is fully better
than a regular seat on United.</i>

12:34.527 --> 12:36.327
Oh, yeah.
So when's the last time you were home?

12:36.396 --> 12:37.728
It's been a while.

12:37.797 --> 12:40.064
My old man and I, we...

12:40.133 --> 12:42.233
we never saw eye-to-eye.

12:42.301 --> 12:44.535
Hey, Sofia, grab the duck.

12:44.604 --> 12:45.936
I dare you.

12:46.005 --> 12:47.905
I dare you to grab the duck.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.507
Get out!
Aah!

12:49.575 --> 12:50.875
You disgust me.

12:50.943 --> 12:53.694
Ow, ow, ow, ow, Papi, no, ow.

12:55.031 --> 12:56.947
This is called daggering, Sofia.

13:00.620 --> 13:01.952
<i>Rafi, ven aquí!</i>

13:02.038 --> 13:04.555
Ow, ow, ow, ow, Papi, no, ow.

13:04.624 --> 13:07.124
Your dad sounds like a real
shit-covered dick hole.

13:07.176 --> 13:09.160
No, he's not that cool.

13:09.228 --> 13:10.711
He's a big shot
down here, though.

13:10.797 --> 13:12.797
He's got San Juan wired.

13:12.849 --> 13:15.466
The call him
the generalissimo, dude.

13:15.518 --> 13:16.967
Whoa, your dad's a general?

13:17.053 --> 13:18.035
Well, sort of.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.770
He's a general manager
of a drug store.

13:19.806 --> 13:21.372
What?! That's
even cooler!

13:21.441 --> 13:22.339
I know!

13:22.408 --> 13:24.642
You can't buy ice in this town

13:24.694 --> 13:25.976
without talking to my dad.

13:26.029 --> 13:27.028
Cool!

13:29.482 --> 13:31.282
There she is.

13:31.317 --> 13:32.900
Puerto Rico.

13:32.985 --> 13:34.285
Hey, man, we're about to land.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.536
Okay, we'd better jump, then.

13:43.129 --> 13:44.862
I'm just glad to finally be safe

13:44.931 --> 13:45.896
and out of the U.S.A.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.231
Hang on, what now?

13:47.300 --> 13:50.367
Oh, I'm currently wanted
in the States for tons of shit,

13:50.436 --> 13:52.036
looked at a list
of all the countries

13:52.105 --> 13:53.671
U.S. has extradition
treaties with--

13:53.740 --> 13:55.139
Puerto Rico, not on in!

13:55.208 --> 13:58.075
Oh, no, Puerto Rico is
part of the United States.

13:58.144 --> 13:59.376
Just like Viet-Guam.

13:59.445 --> 14:00.745
No, if that was true,

14:00.813 --> 14:02.713
then Puerto Ricans
would be Americans,

14:02.782 --> 14:04.115
and I would be a racist.

14:04.183 --> 14:05.149
You know what,
we're wasting time.

14:05.218 --> 14:06.178
We got to find my sister.

14:06.185 --> 14:07.585
Okay, how do we do this?

14:07.653 --> 14:10.087
First we find this piece of
shit doctor that killed her.

14:10.156 --> 14:12.490
Oh, he looks exactly
like a piece of shit.

14:12.558 --> 14:14.458
I'm gonna be honest, I couldn't
find a picture of the doctor,

14:14.527 --> 14:16.427
so I took a picture
of my shit in scrubs.

14:16.496 --> 14:17.962
Where'd you find those
little tiny scrubs?

14:18.030 --> 14:19.697
Oh. No, that's
a four-foot shit.

14:19.766 --> 14:20.931
Whoa!
Those are my shoes it's wearing.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.533
Oh.
That old lady sitting

14:22.602 --> 14:25.306
next to it at the bus stop is for scale.
That's awesome.

14:31.781 --> 14:32.653
Need
some help?

14:32.780 --> 14:35.047
Oh, whoa, oh,
what are you doing?

14:35.115 --> 14:36.782
You're the guy
that crushed my hand.

14:36.817 --> 14:38.483
And now I'm the guy that's
crushing your dick.

14:38.552 --> 14:40.512
You tell us what happened to my sister,

14:40.521 --> 14:42.721
or I swear to God, I will
break your dick off!

14:42.790 --> 14:44.056
You think we won't do it?!

14:44.124 --> 14:45.490
We've broken the dicks
off of people we like!

14:45.559 --> 14:46.892
As a compliment!

14:46.961 --> 14:48.481
What did you do with
Sofia, you sicko?!

14:48.529 --> 14:49.494
Tell us!

14:49.563 --> 14:50.829
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:50.898 --> 14:52.231
Uh, the Puerto Rican Vicodin,

14:52.299 --> 14:53.866
it didn't mix well
with the horse tranquilizers.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.535
You gave horse tranquilizers
to my sister?!

14:56.604 --> 14:58.503
No, no, that's
what I was taking.

14:58.572 --> 15:00.439
Whoa, metal hand.

15:00.507 --> 15:02.674
You're like the guy
from <i> Game of Thrones!</i>

15:02.743 --> 15:05.611
Why aren't you in Westeros
burying Stannis Baratheon?

15:05.679 --> 15:06.945
Hey! I'm a season
behind, okay?

15:07.014 --> 15:08.347
No spoilers.

15:08.415 --> 15:09.948
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

15:10.017 --> 15:11.884
Oh no, how's
Jon Snow taking that?

15:11.952 --> 15:12.918
Oh, buddy.

15:12.987 --> 15:13.919
I got to pee.

15:13.988 --> 15:14.887
Can you just let me go, please?

15:14.955 --> 15:15.954
It's really starting to back up.

15:16.023 --> 15:17.322
I'll let go of your dick,

15:17.391 --> 15:18.657
as soon as you tell us
where you put my sister.

15:18.726 --> 15:20.325
Is she in Casterly Rock?!

15:20.394 --> 15:21.354
I put her in the morgue.

15:21.395 --> 15:23.061
Aha, the morgue.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.331
Randy, we need to find
out what a morgue is

15:26.400 --> 15:27.666
and get there.

15:27.701 --> 15:29.334
House Lannister is the worst.

15:29.403 --> 15:30.669
Yeah, the worst!

15:30.738 --> 15:32.638
Now I'm gonna need
a metal penis.

15:32.706 --> 15:35.307
If you get a metal penis,
I will make you a movie star.

15:35.376 --> 15:36.642
Randy, let's go!

15:39.113 --> 15:40.679
That's the fifth time
that's happened this month.

15:40.748 --> 15:43.108
Okay, well, how are we gonna get
her body out of the morgue?

15:43.150 --> 15:45.317
They're not gonna let us
into a place like that.

15:45.386 --> 15:47.302
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this.

15:50.557 --> 15:52.024
Two more overdoses.

15:52.092 --> 15:54.893
Ugh, these guys have been
dead for a while.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.133
I told you,
if we took enough drugs,

16:01.201 --> 16:03.135
we could successfully
mimic death!

16:03.203 --> 16:04.536
Oh, dude,
you were totally right.

16:04.605 --> 16:05.737
I owe you five bees.

16:05.806 --> 16:07.039
Only problem is, uh,

16:07.107 --> 16:08.573
I think they started
to do an autopsy on me.

16:08.642 --> 16:10.242
Dude.

16:10.311 --> 16:11.476
Look, you can see my heart!

16:11.545 --> 16:12.744
- Oh, cool.
- I'm touching it.

16:12.813 --> 16:13.779
Do it again.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.147
Poke.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.350
Okay, we gotta stop messing
around with my heart.

16:18.419 --> 16:20.252
Okay, let's open these drawers
until we find Sofia.

16:20.321 --> 16:21.286
Come on, let's go!

16:21.355 --> 16:24.156
Ooh, sexy dead bodies.

16:24.224 --> 16:25.424
Ooh, hello, dead boobs.

16:25.492 --> 16:27.009
This one's burned up.

16:27.094 --> 16:28.460
This guy's dick is huge.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.428
Oh, what, really?
Let's see.

16:29.496 --> 16:31.296
Look at this hog.
Oh, man!

16:31.365 --> 16:33.098
Floppa-floppa-
floppa-floppa.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.033
I could do this all night.

16:35.102 --> 16:36.668
But we gotta find Sofia.

16:36.737 --> 16:38.103
She is not here.

16:38.155 --> 16:40.772
And you should not
be here either.

16:40.841 --> 16:44.476
Papi.
I am no longer your <i>papi,</i> you animal.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.211
How'd you even know we were here?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.580
Because a doctor told me
that you attacked his penis.

16:48.649 --> 16:49.815
Yeah, that's not wrong.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.717
You did the same thing
when you were born.

16:51.785 --> 16:53.685
What is it with you
and doctors' penises?

16:53.754 --> 16:54.987
They seem arrogant.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.422
Anyway, my darling Sofia's body

16:57.491 --> 17:00.459
is being prepared
for her proper funeral.

17:00.527 --> 17:02.828
No. She should be buried
in Chicago,

17:02.896 --> 17:04.162
near her husband.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.530
Dad, he's Jewish,

17:05.598 --> 17:08.032
and it's customary
for him to eat her heart.

17:08.102 --> 17:09.342
He'll go to hell if he doesn't.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.868
She is staying here.

17:10.938 --> 17:13.070
And now, so will you,

17:13.140 --> 17:15.406
in a Puerto Rican prison.

17:15.476 --> 17:17.009
What's that?

17:17.077 --> 17:18.977
It's a prison. In Puerto Rico.

17:19.046 --> 17:20.244
What?

17:20.314 --> 17:22.013
You can't do that.
You can't arrest us.

17:22.082 --> 17:22.981
I mean, we haven't even
committed a crime.

17:23.050 --> 17:24.348
Oh, no?

17:24.417 --> 17:25.951
This guy here,
Mr. Floppy,

17:26.020 --> 17:27.685
you are wanted in Illinois

17:27.755 --> 17:29.021
for crimes of video piracy,

17:29.089 --> 17:30.422
bestiality

17:30.491 --> 17:32.924
and perverting a minor animal.

17:32.993 --> 17:36.395
That copy of <i> 50 Shades of Grey</i>
videotaped itself,

17:36.463 --> 17:38.997
I did not have sex with that cat
and if I did,

17:39.066 --> 17:40.899
she told me she was 18!
Yeah!

17:40.968 --> 17:42.334
And there is no
extradition here!

17:42.403 --> 17:43.869
This is still the United States.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.271
Why didn't you tell me that?

17:46.340 --> 17:48.006
Dude, I did...
No, you did not.

17:48.075 --> 17:49.341
Oh, what are you talking...
No, you did not!

17:49.410 --> 17:50.976
Dude, this is what
Dr. Reynolds said.

17:51.045 --> 17:52.110
We need...
Nice meeting you, sir!

17:52.179 --> 17:53.945
Oh, God-- oh, say hi to Mom!

17:54.014 --> 17:55.714
All right.
How are we gonna get out here?

17:55.783 --> 17:56.963
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.984
Have sex with all these dead bodies!
Fire extinguishers.

17:59.053 --> 18:01.319
Ooh, fire extinguisher.
Much better.

18:01.388 --> 18:02.621
Yeah.
No, your idea's good, too, though.

18:02.689 --> 18:03.855
Thank you so much.

18:03.924 --> 18:06.558
Ready, and...

18:09.530 --> 18:11.530
Raf, you got something
on your face!

18:11.598 --> 18:13.432
I don't think so, I... whoa!

18:13.500 --> 18:14.866
Oh, I think it went
through the space

18:14.935 --> 18:16.201
where I got lobotomized before,

18:16.270 --> 18:17.169
so I'm not feeling any of it.

18:17.204 --> 18:18.204
It's like a brain callus.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.272
It's like Maria Callas.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.373
Wait a minute.

18:21.442 --> 18:22.763
Why do I know who
Maria Callas is?

18:22.776 --> 18:23.909
Oh, boy.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.944
All these signs
are talking to me, Randy!

18:26.013 --> 18:27.045
That one says "exit"!

18:27.114 --> 18:28.647
Oh, shit, I can read!

18:28.715 --> 18:30.015
It's like John Travolta
in <i> Phenomenon.</i>

18:30.084 --> 18:31.516
Dude, I have been totally
Travolta'd here.

18:31.585 --> 18:32.706
Awesome.

18:32.753 --> 18:33.913
Oh, we gotta get out of here.

18:33.921 --> 18:35.020
We gotta go! We gotta bail!
Okay.

18:35.089 --> 18:36.588
Ow!

18:36.657 --> 18:38.177
Wait, there's some kind
of force field.

18:38.192 --> 18:39.257
Ah!

18:39.326 --> 18:40.859
Just keep trying!
Okay.

18:40.928 --> 18:42.227
Ah!
Don't change anything!

18:42.296 --> 18:43.695
Just keep trying!
Ah!

18:43.764 --> 18:45.530
Puerto Rico, am I right?
Oh.

18:45.566 --> 18:47.566
Shit!

18:47.634 --> 18:48.617
<i>El policía!</i>

18:48.702 --> 18:49.701
What?
The police.

18:49.736 --> 18:50.735
Don't you speak Spanish?

18:50.804 --> 18:51.736
Sure.
<i>Deténgase.</i>

18:51.805 --> 18:53.121
What's that now?
<i>Deténgase...</i>

18:54.975 --> 18:56.174
Run!

18:56.243 --> 18:57.659
Into the jungle!
Welcome to the jungle!

18:57.744 --> 18:59.911
We got fun and... whoa!

19:04.852 --> 19:06.685
Okay, we ditched 'em.

19:08.622 --> 19:09.502
Ooh! I call head pole!

19:09.556 --> 19:10.522
Okay, listen.

19:10.591 --> 19:12.190
We can hide out
in the jungle tonight.

19:12.259 --> 19:13.699
I'll scavenge up
some second harvest.

19:13.727 --> 19:15.727
Are you a corn guy
or a seeds guy?

19:15.796 --> 19:17.329
Corn.

19:17.397 --> 19:18.864
This is definitely
the safest place to...

19:20.134 --> 19:21.566
I know, I feel
totally safe here...

19:24.104 --> 19:25.170
Thanks, man.
Your dick broke my fall.

19:25.239 --> 19:27.506
All right, dude,

19:27.574 --> 19:29.040
tomorrow is a big day.

19:29.109 --> 19:30.775
We have to find
my sister's body,

19:30.828 --> 19:32.244
before my dad buries it,

19:32.279 --> 19:34.412
or else we're gonna have
to spend the entire day

19:34.481 --> 19:35.997
digging that grave up!

19:36.083 --> 19:38.364
Oh, yeah, my back could not
handle that kind of yard work.

19:39.253 --> 19:40.168
Do you want to...

19:40.254 --> 19:41.453
spoon, or...

19:41.505 --> 19:42.420
Why don't we just fork it?

19:42.456 --> 19:43.455
Yeah, let's fork.

19:43.540 --> 19:44.623
Yep.

19:44.675 --> 19:45.874
Ooh, lock it in.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.459
Yeah, interlock our balls...
Great.

19:47.511 --> 19:48.426
There we go.

19:50.013 --> 19:51.296
Hey, Raf?
Yeah.

19:51.381 --> 19:52.464
Are you hard right now?

19:52.516 --> 19:54.766
I got a bad case of lump dick.

19:54.801 --> 19:56.218
My dick is covered
in bee stings,

19:56.303 --> 19:58.386
so it's swollen, numb
and full of poison.

19:58.472 --> 20:00.188
I need to talk
to your travel agent,

20:00.274 --> 20:02.474
'cause you're having the trip
I want to have.

20:02.526 --> 20:03.975
Good night, Rafi.

20:04.027 --> 20:05.894
Good night, Randy.

20:07.000 --> 20:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:14.287 --> 20:15.253
Oh, my God.

20:15.322 --> 20:16.387
Ran... Randy?

20:16.456 --> 20:18.022
Dude, don't...
don't move.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.224
It's a chupacabra!

20:20.293 --> 20:21.392
Yeah, I know.

20:21.461 --> 20:22.961
He's so cute, right?

20:23.029 --> 20:24.095
Oh, my God.

20:24.164 --> 20:25.124
I want to play with him.

20:25.165 --> 20:26.531
Whoa, look at this!

20:26.600 --> 20:28.399
Oh, we're wrestling.
Oh-- oh, wow.

20:28.468 --> 20:30.069
Oh, he really locked
on to my neck there.

20:30.070 --> 20:31.191
He's going for that jugular.

20:31.237 --> 20:32.103
Oh, yeah, he lives off blood.

20:32.172 --> 20:33.204
Down, boy. Down.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.339
Oh, no, I've been training him.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.306
"Down, boy" means
"Go for the dick."

20:35.375 --> 20:36.291
Oh, boy!

20:36.376 --> 20:38.343
Oh, he's really on there.

20:41.681 --> 20:42.880
You're right.

20:42.949 --> 20:44.515
Look at us, we fit in perfectly.

20:44.584 --> 20:45.850
No one suspects a thing.

20:45.919 --> 20:47.199
Now we just have
to find the body

20:47.220 --> 20:48.553
before they light it on fire.

20:48.622 --> 20:50.421
That Jew better be happy
when we deliver this heart.

20:50.490 --> 20:52.790
I told him I want to watch him
eat the whole thing.

20:52.859 --> 20:54.025
Do they knife and fork it,

20:54.094 --> 20:55.560
or they just shove it in
with their hands?

20:55.612 --> 20:56.961
No, they have to eat it like a hand fruit.

20:57.030 --> 20:59.030
This is our daughter.

20:59.099 --> 21:01.132
She's, um...
very sick.

21:01.201 --> 21:02.634
Herpes.

21:02.702 --> 21:04.035
She's rotten with herpes.

21:04.104 --> 21:06.404
She has her father's herpes.

21:06.473 --> 21:10.008
And now, to celebrate
the end of a life,

21:10.076 --> 21:13.478
we will dance the traditional
dance of Puerto Rico.

21:13.546 --> 21:14.846
I know what this is.

21:14.914 --> 21:16.481
This is daggering.

21:16.549 --> 21:17.749
Oh, that's awesome.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.500
That's the only way
I know how to dance.

21:19.586 --> 21:20.718
Ay!
Ay!

21:27.260 --> 21:28.593
Yeah! Get it!

21:28.645 --> 21:30.628
I wish I had
a male dick right now.

21:31.798 --> 21:34.465
These Puerto Ricans
know how to funeral.

21:34.534 --> 21:35.299
<i>Deténgase.</i>

21:35.368 --> 21:37.101
Huh! There's that word again.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.436
Somehow they saw through
our disguises!

21:38.521 --> 21:39.604
All right,
let's get out of here.

21:39.656 --> 21:40.905
Uh-oh.

21:40.974 --> 21:41.906
Whoa!

21:43.943 --> 21:45.109
Get him, Chupi!
Yes!

21:45.195 --> 21:46.411
Down, boy!
Eat his dick!

21:46.446 --> 21:48.513
Yeah, get that "D," Chupi!

21:48.581 --> 21:50.081
So jealous of our
daughter right now.

21:50.150 --> 21:51.382
We gotta get out of here.

21:57.123 --> 21:58.456
Why is she dressed
for a wedding?

21:58.525 --> 21:59.891
Ah, Papi probably wants her

21:59.959 --> 22:01.225
to marry someone else
in the afterlife.

22:01.294 --> 22:02.860
She was so bonable.

22:02.929 --> 22:05.463
Aw... I only wish she was alive
to hear you say that.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.898
Oh, I screamed it at her a lot.

22:06.966 --> 22:07.999
Yeah, me, too.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.133
Rafi!

22:09.219 --> 22:12.403
You were always
such a disobedient child.

22:12.472 --> 22:14.439
You are supposed to be dead!

22:14.507 --> 22:15.707
Whoa, Dad.

22:15.775 --> 22:17.775
Looks like we've got
a Mexican standoff.

22:17.844 --> 22:19.243
Uh, actually,
we-we don't, technically,

22:19.312 --> 22:20.578
'cause only he has a gun.

22:20.647 --> 22:22.880
Okay, so maybe we have
a Puerto Rican standoff?

22:22.949 --> 22:23.981
What is the difference

22:24.050 --> 22:24.949
between Puerto Ricans
and Mexicans anyway?

22:25.018 --> 22:26.017
Such a good question.

22:26.086 --> 22:27.167
Dad, what is the difference

22:27.220 --> 22:28.319
between Puerto Ricans
and Mexicans?

22:28.388 --> 22:30.188
Where are we
vis-à-vis tacos and...

22:30.256 --> 22:31.255
<i>Cállate!</i>

22:31.324 --> 22:32.223
Whoa!

22:32.292 --> 22:33.591
This is all your fault.

22:33.660 --> 22:34.592
That gun's loaded.

22:34.661 --> 22:36.094
Your sick perversions

22:36.162 --> 22:39.263
scared my beautiful daughter
away from Puerto Rican men

22:39.332 --> 22:42.133
and into the arms and tentacles

22:42.202 --> 22:44.068
of the Jew devil!

22:44.137 --> 22:45.069
Wow.

22:45.138 --> 22:46.437
That is anti-Semitic.

22:46.506 --> 22:47.438
That crosses the line.

22:47.507 --> 22:48.873
This ends now.

22:48.942 --> 22:51.309
I'm going to shoot
your dick off.

22:51.377 --> 22:53.044
Weird thing for a dad
to say to his son,

22:53.113 --> 22:54.078
but all right.

22:54.147 --> 22:55.313
Let me help you.

22:55.381 --> 22:56.064
Huh?

22:58.852 --> 23:00.485
You still had
the pubic bee beard?

23:00.553 --> 23:01.886
Yeah. They didn't
want to leave.

23:01.955 --> 23:03.855
And I still have
six in the chamber.

23:03.923 --> 23:05.089
Pow! Pow!
Pow! Pow!

23:05.158 --> 23:07.225
Pow!

23:07.293 --> 23:08.292
Why?!

23:08.361 --> 23:09.560
Now let's get out of here!

23:09.629 --> 23:11.195
- Get the body, quick!
- Let's go!

23:11.264 --> 23:12.697
Quick, quick!

23:12.766 --> 23:14.365
Use her body as a shield!

23:14.434 --> 23:15.800
Oh! Ah! Look out!
Ah! Ah!

23:15.869 --> 23:16.868
Not the tit!

23:18.805 --> 23:19.871
All right,
we're gonna have to jump.

23:19.939 --> 23:20.838
I got a better idea!

23:22.142 --> 23:23.741
Look, she's planking.

23:23.810 --> 23:24.976
Check it out, I'm surfing.

23:25.044 --> 23:26.928
How are we gonna get her
back through security?

23:27.013 --> 23:28.463
We'll just have to take
off her shoes and belt.

23:28.548 --> 23:30.248
Bees! To me!

23:32.185 --> 23:35.019
<i>And so, after all that,</i>

23:35.054 --> 23:36.354
I brought our baby home.

23:36.389 --> 23:38.055
Oh, my God.

23:38.108 --> 23:39.557
Gangster.

23:39.609 --> 23:40.641
She looks terrible.

23:40.727 --> 23:41.442
Hi, Sofia.

23:41.528 --> 23:43.060
And even in

23:43.146 --> 23:44.695
her body's inevitable
melting to earth,

23:44.731 --> 23:48.533
Sofia is making me
just rock hard.

23:53.406 --> 23:54.322
Hey, Chupi.

23:54.407 --> 23:55.490
Glad her mom made it

23:55.575 --> 23:56.457
back for the funeral.

23:57.710 --> 23:58.831
Even in grief, still got it.

23:58.847 --> 24:09.788
