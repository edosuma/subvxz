00:41.932 --> 00:46.811
- 7:45 on this beautiful, almost balmy
22nd of September in Schenectady.

00:46.978 --> 00:48.562
And it's the first day of fall.

00:48.730 --> 00:51.482
So in honor of that fact,
we have Elke Putzkammer...

00:51.650 --> 00:53.734
...professor of literature
at Union college...

00:53.902 --> 00:56.153
...to talk about autumn in poetry
and literature.

00:56.321 --> 00:58.239
- Good morning, professor.
- Hi, Alex.

00:58.407 --> 01:01.867
So, what about it? Why do
so many people write about the fall?

01:02.035 --> 01:05.579
Well, I think it's seen
as the beginning of the end, really.

01:05.747 --> 01:09.542
If the year is a life, then September,
the beginning of fall...

01:09.709 --> 01:12.962
...is when the bloom is off the rose
and things start to die.

01:13.130 --> 01:17.049
It's a melancholy month and maybe
because of that, quite beautiful.

01:17.217 --> 01:19.093
Is there something
you might read to us?

01:19.261 --> 01:21.470
Oh, I'd love to.

01:21.638 --> 01:25.516
Whoever has no house now
Will never have one.

01:25.684 --> 01:29.061
Whoever is alone will stay alone

01:29.229 --> 01:33.774
Will sit, read, write long letters
Through the evening

01:33.942 --> 01:37.445
And wander the boulevards
Up and down, restlessly

01:37.612 --> 01:39.864
While the dry leaves are blowing

01:40.031 --> 01:42.324
Goodness, that harsh, isn't it?

01:42.492 --> 01:46.662
Well, perhaps. But truthful.

01:49.249 --> 01:51.125
Mommy, done.

01:51.293 --> 01:53.252
Okay.

01:54.796 --> 01:56.088
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:56.256 --> 01:58.340
- I tried not to wake you.
- Well, thanks.

01:58.508 --> 02:00.843
You didn't. I just...
You know, I couldn't get up.

02:07.642 --> 02:10.186
- Caden, can you get that?
- It's Maria, I don't want to.

02:10.353 --> 02:13.481
- Caden... Oh, that's weird.
- Hey, it's me. How are you?

02:13.648 --> 02:15.858
Mommy, is something wrong
with my poop?

02:16.568 --> 02:19.820
No, honey, it's just green.
You probably ate something green.

02:19.988 --> 02:23.407
I didn't. What's wrong with me?

02:23.909 --> 02:26.744
I have to get that, Olive.
You're gonna be fine, okay?

02:26.912 --> 02:29.205
- But, Mommy...
- Yeah, I'll be right back, Olive.

02:29.372 --> 02:33.042
Oh, nothing.
Just wiping Olive's ass. You?

02:33.210 --> 02:36.754
- An earthquake in Kashmir...
- Oh, you're kidding. Holy fuck.

02:36.922 --> 02:41.008
...has killed an estimated 73,000...
- I don't feel well.

02:41.718 --> 02:43.260
Oh, my goodness.

03:03.949 --> 03:06.242
- March in Washington, D.c., today,
October 15th.

03:07.619 --> 03:10.955
- Harold Pinter died.
- Well, he's old, right?

03:11.122 --> 03:13.332
- No, wait. He won the Nobel Prize.
- Mom.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.793
- What, honey?
- Do you need to look at my poop?

03:15.961 --> 03:20.589
- You sure it's all right?
- It's fine, Olive. Just flush.

03:20.757 --> 03:23.467
What if it's alive? What if I kill it?

03:23.635 --> 03:25.844
- It's green like plants.
- It's not alive, honey.

03:26.012 --> 03:29.765
Remember the production of
The Dumb Waiter I did at Albanyfest?

03:32.060 --> 03:33.477
Have your oatmeal, honey.

03:34.354 --> 03:37.273
- I want peanut butter and jelly.
- You said oatmeal.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.818
- This isn't a restaurant.
- I don't want oatmeal.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.487
- Okay. Fine.
- Mommy, I'm sorry.

03:43.655 --> 03:48.576
They found avian flu in Turkey.
In the country Turkey, not turkeys.

03:48.743 --> 03:52.538
- Can I watch TV till school?
- In some chickens. Yeah.

03:55.125 --> 03:58.294
There is a secret something at play
under the surface...

03:58.461 --> 04:01.338
...growing like an invisible virus
of thought.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.591
But you're being changed by it...

04:03.758 --> 04:05.467
- Milk's expired.
- Okay.

04:05.635 --> 04:06.677
Jesus.

04:08.513 --> 04:10.014
- You better eat this.
- I will.

04:11.308 --> 04:12.641
Yeah.

04:13.059 --> 04:15.102
How did I guess
you'd ask me that question?

04:15.270 --> 04:17.813
Happy Halloween, Schenectady.

04:18.857 --> 04:21.190
And how long have you been
in New York for?

04:21.358 --> 04:25.195
The first black graduate
of the University of Alabama died.

04:25.363 --> 04:27.281
Vivian Malone Jones.

04:28.325 --> 04:32.036
Stroke, 63.

04:48.845 --> 04:50.638
Fuck!

04:50.805 --> 04:54.308
God! Somebody! Adele, help!

04:55.560 --> 04:58.979
- Jesus, Caden, what the fuck?
- I was shaving and the thing flew off!

04:59.147 --> 05:01.649
Oh, my God!
Jesus, look at your head.

05:01.816 --> 05:03.901
Oh, shit.

05:04.069 --> 05:06.070
Oh, God, I can't turn it.

05:06.738 --> 05:08.489
Oh, wait.

05:13.536 --> 05:16.914
- Mommy, Daddy has blood.
- Yeah.

05:17.082 --> 05:20.751
- Will there be a scar?
- Probably. It looks like a mud flap.

05:20.919 --> 05:24.213
- I prefer there not to be a scar.
- Yeah.

05:25.090 --> 05:26.173
That fellow is annoying.

05:26.341 --> 05:28.884
He's in here every week,
like clockwork.

05:29.552 --> 05:32.721
There. I think that should...
Let's see.

05:34.766 --> 05:37.601
- What?
- Change in bowel movements?

05:37.769 --> 05:40.854
It's a little more yellow than usual.
Why?

05:42.732 --> 05:45.776
Yeah, I'd like you to see
an ophthalmologist.

05:45.944 --> 05:48.278
- A neurologist?
- What? No.

05:48.446 --> 05:51.240
An ophthalmologist.
I said, ophthalmologist.

05:51.908 --> 05:53.492
Do you hear that?

05:53.827 --> 05:55.244
Yeah.

05:55.829 --> 05:59.123
And today is Tuesday.
Mommy, is today Tuesday?

05:59.290 --> 06:03.210
No, honey, today is Friday.
So, what exactly did he say?

06:07.173 --> 06:12.678
That my pupils weren't properly
opening and closing.

06:12.846 --> 06:14.138
Dilating.

06:14.305 --> 06:16.640
- No.
- Yeah.

06:16.808 --> 06:19.518
- I don't think that's what he said.
- Yes.

06:19.686 --> 06:22.229
- That's not what he said.
- Is it the bump to your head?

06:22.397 --> 06:24.022
He doesn't know. Maybe.

06:24.190 --> 06:27.317
He said he doesn't think so,
but maybe. But he doesn't know.

06:27.485 --> 06:30.988
- But maybe. Who knows?
- Okay, Jesus, Caden, I got it.

06:31.823 --> 06:34.032
- He doesn't know...
- Sorry. I'm a little anxious.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.660
- Did you have to get a shot, Daddy?
- No, honey.

06:36.828 --> 06:39.705
- It's the start of something awful.
- Do I have to get a shot?

06:39.873 --> 06:42.499
- Course not.
- Did you tell him I have green poo?

06:42.667 --> 06:44.918
- It's fucked timing.
- Call the plumber. Hey.

06:45.086 --> 06:47.129
Sorry. I have rehearsal. Fuck.

06:47.297 --> 06:51.341
- Hey, come on.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry. Everybody, sorry.

06:51.509 --> 06:53.677
How many years
until I have to get more shots?

06:53.845 --> 07:00.184
- Not for a really long time, babe.
- A million years?

07:00.643 --> 07:04.146
- Remember what Dr. Woodman said...
- Dad, what's a plumber?

07:04.314 --> 07:06.231
- He's a man...
- Or a woman, Dad.

07:06.399 --> 07:13.030
Right. He's a man or a woman
who fixes sinks and toilets and...

07:13.198 --> 07:15.240
- Do you know what pipes are?
- No.

07:15.408 --> 07:18.869
- Hey, Jim. I had an accident.
- Like to smoke out of?

07:19.037 --> 07:22.164
A different kind of pipe, honey.
All right, bye.

07:24.417 --> 07:28.378
Houses have pipes,
and they're made of...

07:28.546 --> 07:31.298
They're like tubes,
and they're behind the walls...

07:31.466 --> 07:34.593
...and they're under the floors
and everywhere.

07:34.761 --> 07:36.220
- And...
- What's the matter?

07:36.387 --> 07:38.680
- Every single where?
- It's okay, honey.

07:38.848 --> 07:41.642
They just carry water
to and from sinks and toilets.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.812
- It's like in your body. You have veins.
- Capillaries.

07:44.979 --> 07:46.688
Capillaries filled with blood.

07:46.856 --> 07:50.400
I have blood? I don't want blood.
I don't want blood.

07:50.568 --> 07:52.820
- What are you doing?
- Trying to explain plumbing.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.446
- Stop.
- I can't do this now.

07:54.614 --> 07:58.242
- Don't worry, you don't have blood.
- Don't tell her she doesn't have blood.

07:58.409 --> 08:01.245
- Caden, stop it.
- I don't want blood.

08:08.294 --> 08:10.754
Thanks for getting me in right away.

08:13.925 --> 08:17.761
- Was it the bump to the head?
- No.

08:22.308 --> 08:25.936
Could be, but I think we need
to get you to a neurologist.

08:26.104 --> 08:28.689
- Neurologist?
- It's a brain expert.

08:28.857 --> 08:30.190
I know what a neurologist is.

08:30.358 --> 08:34.443
- I thought from the way you asked...
- I just thought you said "urologist. "

08:38.866 --> 08:42.953
- Why do I need to see a neurologist?
- Just for a look-see.

08:43.955 --> 08:46.790
The eyes are part of the brain,
after all.

08:48.084 --> 08:50.460
No, that's not true, is it?

08:52.714 --> 08:58.010
- Why would I say it if it weren't true?
- It doesn't seem right.

08:58.761 --> 09:01.430
Like morally correct,
or "right" as in accurate?

09:05.810 --> 09:10.480
I don't know. Accurate, I guess?

09:12.817 --> 09:13.984
Interesting.

09:14.152 --> 09:17.070
Now, when you kick off, boy,
I want a 70-yard boot.

09:17.238 --> 09:19.239
And get right down the field
under the ball.

09:19.407 --> 09:23.327
And when you hit, hit low and hit hard,
because it's important, boy.

09:23.494 --> 09:25.913
There's all kinds of important people
in the stands.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.625
And the first thing you know... Ben?

09:30.501 --> 09:32.336
Ben, where do I?

09:33.838 --> 09:37.507
- Ben, how do I?
- Willy, you coming up?

09:38.301 --> 09:40.135
Willy?

09:40.970 --> 09:43.180
Willy, answer me.

09:43.848 --> 09:47.434
Willy! No!

09:48.353 --> 09:49.853
- Oh, Jesus, come on.
- Oh, crap.

09:50.021 --> 09:52.022
Claire, are you okay?
What's happening here?

09:52.190 --> 09:54.441
It's too late in the game
to have these problems.

09:54.609 --> 09:57.027
- I know, Caden. I'm sorry. We'll get it.
- Oh, my God.

09:57.195 --> 10:01.365
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think the wig saved my life.

10:01.532 --> 10:04.368
- Yeah.
- It's okay, honestly.

10:04.869 --> 10:06.078
That was good, Tom.

10:06.245 --> 10:07.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:07.497 --> 10:10.749
I was trying something different.
I was crashing differently.

10:10.917 --> 10:14.252
- Ambivalently.
- Yeah, I saw that. I liked it.

10:21.302 --> 10:24.221
Try to keep in mind that
a young person playing Willy Loman...

10:24.389 --> 10:28.517
...thinks he's only pretending
to be at the end of a life full of despair.

10:28.685 --> 10:31.645
But the tragedy is that we know
that you, the young actor...

10:31.813 --> 10:35.232
...will end up in this very place
of desolation.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.067
Okay.

10:40.321 --> 10:41.905
That's great.

10:42.740 --> 10:46.410
- Let's try it again. How long, David?
- I think 15.

10:49.205 --> 10:50.831
Anything?

10:52.875 --> 10:54.584
So now what?

10:58.423 --> 11:00.549
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:00.717 --> 11:04.928
- In search of the elusive signal.
- The signal's good here, oddly.

11:05.096 --> 11:08.140
- That is odd.
- I know. Cell phones, they're crazy.

11:08.307 --> 11:10.726
- See you in a few.
- Yep.

11:13.938 --> 11:18.108
Yeah, Dr. Heshborg said
I should see a Dr. Scoriano.

11:19.777 --> 11:21.737
My pupils don't work.

11:28.745 --> 11:31.413
I think I have blood in my stool.

11:34.459 --> 11:37.127
That stool in your office?

11:38.796 --> 11:42.466
- When I was pregnant with Olive.
- What was it like?

11:42.633 --> 11:46.094
I don't know. Hopeful or something.
Like something was gonna change.

11:46.262 --> 11:48.305
- Yeah, something did. No?
- Yeah.

11:48.473 --> 11:50.098
- Yeah, of course.
- I mean, bigtime.

11:50.266 --> 11:53.101
I mean, maybe not as much
as I'd hoped.

11:53.436 --> 11:55.687
I'm sorry.
That's a terrible thing to say.

11:55.855 --> 11:59.566
There are no terrible things to say
in here, only true and false.

11:59.984 --> 12:04.154
- Can I say something awful?
- Yes, please do.

12:06.407 --> 12:09.659
I've fantasized about Caden dying.

12:13.164 --> 12:15.874
Being able to start again, guilt-free.

12:16.626 --> 12:20.462
I know that's... That's bad.

12:21.506 --> 12:24.174
- Caden, does that feel terrible?
- Yeah.

12:24.342 --> 12:26.301
Okay, good.

12:43.861 --> 12:46.363
It's a nightmare in there.

12:47.198 --> 12:49.282
I'm sorry.

12:59.877 --> 13:01.920
So, I'm reading The Trial.

13:02.088 --> 13:03.547
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:05.174 --> 13:08.051
- You like?
- Love.

13:08.219 --> 13:11.680
I'm such an idiot
for not knowing about this book.

13:11.848 --> 13:14.808
- It's famous, as it turns out.
- Yeah.

13:15.434 --> 13:17.602
You're not an idiot.

13:20.356 --> 13:22.607
Then you say:

13:22.775 --> 13:27.904
"In fact, Hazel, you're very bright,
and I love your eyes. "

13:32.243 --> 13:35.912
- In fact, Hazel, you're very bright.
- Oh, am I?

13:36.080 --> 13:41.042
- And I love your eyes.
- Do you? Oh, you're a darling.

13:47.216 --> 13:49.301
Then what do I say?

13:49.594 --> 13:53.263
- I can't say what then you say.
- Why?

13:53.848 --> 13:56.099
Because it's dirty.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.230
Could you step out for a second?

14:02.607 --> 14:06.318
Go ahead. I've seen boy parts.

14:13.326 --> 14:18.121
- Can I take a piss in your sink?
- Yeah, sure. I guess.

14:28.716 --> 14:30.634
We're sold out.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.594
Great.

14:40.228 --> 14:42.145
Gorgeous.

14:43.648 --> 14:45.273
Thanks.

14:45.441 --> 14:49.069
- How was rehearsal?
- Awful.

14:49.237 --> 14:52.989
We have 560 lighting cues.

14:53.199 --> 14:57.160
- I don't why I make it so complicated.
- Because that's what you do.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.162
Yeah.

15:01.832 --> 15:05.877
We got through it though.
That's really pretty.

15:07.338 --> 15:10.131
Caden, I'm sorry, I...

15:13.344 --> 15:15.095
I can't come tonight. I'm sorry.

15:15.263 --> 15:18.431
I have two canvasses I have
to get ready to ship for tomorrow.

15:18.599 --> 15:20.433
- I know it sucks...
- It's opening night.

15:20.601 --> 15:24.104
I know. I wish I could come.
I would if I could.

15:24.272 --> 15:26.273
- I've gotta get ready.
- Tomorrow...

15:26.440 --> 15:29.192
I have to get ready.
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

15:29.568 --> 15:31.861
I have to figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

15:51.757 --> 15:53.508
Hey.

16:07.064 --> 16:10.859
- Oh, boy, oh boy.
- Willy?

16:11.444 --> 16:13.903
It's all right, I came back.

16:16.574 --> 16:18.950
I hated myself tonight.

16:20.036 --> 16:22.412
- Plus, I'm so... Excuse me.
- Hey, Tom.

16:22.580 --> 16:23.997
I'm so bloated and enormous.

16:24.165 --> 16:26.708
No, you look good. You were great.
I was very pleased.

16:26.876 --> 16:29.753
- You okay?
- Sorry. A little bit of a headache.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.588
Willy Loman.

16:34.383 --> 16:37.218
I just wanted to say thank you
for everything.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.596
You've been absolutely brilliant.

16:39.764 --> 16:42.766
It's gonna be miserable
going ahead without you.

16:42.933 --> 16:46.436
- I'll be around. I'll check in.
- I'm such a baby.

16:47.063 --> 16:49.064
Okay. I'm gonna go get drunk,
that's what.

16:49.231 --> 16:53.443
Okay. Claire. Sweetheart.

16:57.406 --> 17:00.325
- Good. Good job.
- Oh, don't worry, I'll get better.

17:00.493 --> 17:03.078
- Good work.
- Don't worry, it'll get better.

17:05.623 --> 17:09.209
Hey. I figured I'd better get in fast.

17:09.377 --> 17:13.296
- Hey, you wanna sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:19.303 --> 17:23.807
- Where's el wife-o?
- Had to work.

17:24.141 --> 17:26.976
Her show in Berlin is in two weeks.

17:27.144 --> 17:29.145
We're gonna go there
for like a month.

17:29.313 --> 17:33.108
- Why do I like you so much?
- I couldn't begin to guess.

17:33.275 --> 17:35.110
Me neither.

17:36.320 --> 17:39.114
Do you get high, my friend?

17:41.033 --> 17:43.493
You know, sometimes.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.497
Do you want to now?
With me, in my car?

17:47.665 --> 17:50.208
I get kind of...

17:51.877 --> 17:54.295
...something when I'm stoned.

17:54.463 --> 17:57.048
What does "something" mean?

17:57.675 --> 17:59.509
You know...

18:01.220 --> 18:03.012
...bothered.

18:03.180 --> 18:06.182
- What does "bothered" mean?
- You know.

18:06.892 --> 18:10.228
Bothered. Horny.

18:13.190 --> 18:16.276
And me with a station wagon and all.
Could be dangerous.

18:16.444 --> 18:20.864
- Yeah, could be.
- You're absolutely zero fun.

18:34.378 --> 18:37.213
When are the reviews
gonna get here?

18:40.593 --> 18:42.302
Don't know.

18:47.641 --> 18:50.894
His best friends finger two babies...

18:51.061 --> 18:53.438
One this big, one this big.
- And two kittens.

18:53.606 --> 18:57.484
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden. How'd it go?

18:59.528 --> 19:00.945
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:01.113 --> 19:02.780
It's late.

19:04.074 --> 19:06.743
Maria came over
to keep me company because...

19:06.911 --> 19:09.037
And we just lost track.
I got everything done.

19:09.205 --> 19:14.292
But I'm sorry I missed your play.
I'm sorry. But how'd it go?

19:14.919 --> 19:17.045
Great. We're a hit.

19:18.047 --> 19:19.756
Reviews are great.

19:19.924 --> 19:24.427
Times said it was brilliant casting
young people as Willy and Linda.

19:24.595 --> 19:28.598
- That's great, Caden. Good for you.
- Great.

19:28.766 --> 19:32.352
I can't wait to see it tomorrow.
That's... Tonight.

19:33.479 --> 19:34.604
That's great.

19:35.397 --> 19:38.775
Wow, it's really late... Early.

19:39.360 --> 19:41.110
Early.

19:41.570 --> 19:44.572
It's late.
Hey, I would love to see it too.

19:44.740 --> 19:48.284
- Can we get Maria a ticket?
- You're stoned.

19:49.578 --> 19:52.580
I mean, a little. It's, you know...
I don't know.

19:52.748 --> 19:55.583
But are you happy with it?

19:55.751 --> 20:00.004
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love for you to see...
To know what you think.

20:00.631 --> 20:02.215
It doesn't matter what I think.

20:02.383 --> 20:07.804
Absolutely. It's all about
your artistic satisfaction, Caden.

20:17.439 --> 20:20.149
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

20:31.412 --> 20:36.416
- I've always loved this house.
- Yes, it's a wonderful place.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.919
The truth is, I never really imagined
I could afford it.

20:40.087 --> 20:42.088
Well, the sellers
are very motivated now.

20:46.510 --> 20:52.348
It's a scary decision.
I never thought I'd buy a house alone.

20:52.516 --> 20:56.352
But, you know, I'm 36,
and I wonder what it is I'm waiting for.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.315
- Home buying is always scary.
- And with the fire and all especially.

21:00.482 --> 21:02.734
Well, it's a good size though,
2200 square feet...

21:02.901 --> 21:05.320
...not including
the partially finished basement.

21:05.487 --> 21:07.614
Oh, I don't know.

21:08.699 --> 21:12.785
- I'm thinking I should go.
- It's a perfect size for someone alone.

21:12.953 --> 21:19.500
I like it, I do. I'm just really concerned
about dying in the fire.

21:19.835 --> 21:23.129
It's a big decision
how one prefers to die.

21:23.297 --> 21:26.215
Would you like to meet my son?
Derek.

21:27.384 --> 21:30.970
Derek's living in the basement
since his divorce, if that's okay.

21:31.138 --> 21:32.847
Hey, Mom.

21:38.562 --> 21:41.439
- Let's go, Ma.
- I want just a minute.

21:49.865 --> 21:51.741
I never...

21:53.410 --> 21:57.246
Forgive me, dear. I can't cry.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.751
I don't know what it is,
but I can't cry.

22:05.047 --> 22:09.342
It seems to me
that you're just on another trip.

22:09.510 --> 22:13.096
I keep expecting you.
Why did you do it?

22:13.263 --> 22:17.266
I search and I search
and I can't understand it.

22:17.434 --> 22:21.896
I made the last payment
on the house today.

22:22.064 --> 22:26.776
We're free and clear.
We're free. We're free.

22:32.866 --> 22:35.201
- Well done.
- Bravo.

22:35.953 --> 22:40.998
- Well done. It was very successful.
- I thought it was wonderful.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.251
Why did the older people
look so young?

22:43.419 --> 22:45.962
It was a choice, Dad.
I'll explain later.

22:46.130 --> 22:51.384
I can't get excited about your restaging
someone else's old play, it just...

22:51.552 --> 22:53.094
There's nothing personal in it.

22:53.262 --> 22:55.680
People are coming out of the theater
crying.

22:55.848 --> 22:58.266
Great. Be a fucking tool
of suburban, blue-haired...

22:58.434 --> 23:00.184
...regional-theater subscribers.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.145
- You didn't you think it was long?
- No.

23:02.312 --> 23:03.771
But what are you leaving behind?

23:03.939 --> 23:06.232
You act as if you have forever
to figure it out.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.901
When you're dead, there's no time.
The world is...

23:09.069 --> 23:12.405
I don't know.
I slept maybe three hours.

23:12.573 --> 23:14.782
So we're both tired.

23:16.326 --> 23:19.495
No, I cuddled with Olive all night.
It was great.

23:24.752 --> 23:27.503
Morning. Morning.

23:28.922 --> 23:32.925
- Morning, Caden.
- I think I might have arthritis.

23:33.093 --> 23:34.635
Friends on fire.

23:37.347 --> 23:38.806
I'm going to.

23:41.185 --> 23:45.938
No, I know exactly.
Okay, I will. I'll call you later.

23:46.106 --> 23:47.356
I know. You're right. Bye.

23:50.277 --> 23:52.820
My joints are stiff.

23:55.532 --> 23:57.450
Who was that?

23:59.620 --> 24:01.829
- Maria.
- Right.

24:02.372 --> 24:05.041
Three hours since you spoke.

24:05.501 --> 24:08.878
Caden, I think I wanna go to Berlin
with just Olive.

24:11.548 --> 24:15.301
- I think it would be good for us.
- Oh, Christ.

24:15.469 --> 24:17.386
Morning, kiddos.

24:19.223 --> 24:21.724
Why don't you want me to go?

24:21.892 --> 24:27.230
You know, I think it would be a good
thing for the two of us to do alone.

24:27.397 --> 24:31.067
How do you think I'm supposed
to respond to something like that?

24:33.904 --> 24:36.739
- Want me to zip your coat up?
- Yeah.

24:41.662 --> 24:44.539
What's wrong with your face,
Daddy?

24:45.791 --> 24:47.959
It's pustules.

24:48.460 --> 24:51.170
It's called sycosis.

24:51.338 --> 24:55.424
Spelled differently than "psychosis,"
but it sounds the same.

24:55.592 --> 24:57.218
I don't know what that means.

24:57.386 --> 24:58.928
Of course not.

24:59.096 --> 25:03.140
Well, there are two kinds of psychosis.
They're spelled differently.

25:03.308 --> 25:08.020
P- S-Y is like if you're crazy,
like Mama.

25:08.981 --> 25:11.941
S- Y is like these ugly things
on my face.

25:12.317 --> 25:14.902
- You could have both, though.
- I could, but I don't.

25:24.454 --> 25:26.747
Can I ask you something, Ad?

25:30.794 --> 25:33.588
Have I disappointed you somehow?

25:34.673 --> 25:38.885
I don't know what I'm doing.
We're just spending a little time apart.

25:43.265 --> 25:45.474
We'll talk when I get back, okay?

25:49.062 --> 25:53.149
Everyone is disappointing.
The more you know someone, it just...

25:54.276 --> 25:57.987
This whole romantic-love thing,
it's just a projection anyway, right?

25:58.363 --> 26:00.531
I mean, I don't know.

26:04.661 --> 26:07.371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:09.499 --> 26:11.626
I love you.

26:17.966 --> 26:21.844
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know.

26:29.144 --> 26:30.728
We'll talk when I get back.

26:34.441 --> 26:36.150
Okay?

26:48.163 --> 26:50.957
Flurostatin TR
allows you to live life...

26:51.124 --> 26:55.044
...when it's your turn to face
the challenges of chemotherapy.

27:10.102 --> 27:13.229
Ask your doctor
if Flurostatin TR is right for you.

27:30.539 --> 27:33.499
- And I'm on the first train
out of Palookaville.

27:33.667 --> 27:36.335
- The Miracle Brush
can scour everything from bottles...

27:36.503 --> 27:39.255
- Rise and shine...
- Lift those legs...

27:59.693 --> 28:03.320
- I'm lonely.
- Yes. Anything else?

28:04.906 --> 28:08.117
- I'm hurt.
- Yes. And?

28:13.290 --> 28:15.708
I think Adele's right.
I'm not doing anything real...

28:15.876 --> 28:17.752
What would be real?

28:17.961 --> 28:20.337
I'm afraid I'm gonna die.

28:21.423 --> 28:23.674
I don't know what's wrong with me.

28:23.842 --> 28:26.260
I wanna do something important
while I'm still here.

28:26.428 --> 28:30.806
That would be the time to do it. I have
a book that might help you get better.

28:30.974 --> 28:34.810
- Better?
- It's called Getting Better.

28:35.771 --> 28:39.106
- Who wrote it?
- I did. All of these.

28:39.274 --> 28:42.651
- Wow, I never knew that.
- Yes. Well, wow, indeed.

28:44.988 --> 28:46.822
In conclusion... Cats eat rats...

28:46.990 --> 28:50.117
Within his own plumbing...
Me who am as a raw nerve...

28:50.285 --> 28:52.828
Synthetic vaginal juices...
Substantial crease...

28:52.996 --> 28:54.663
That's $45.

29:07.469 --> 29:11.138
Five. Five.

29:12.474 --> 29:14.225
Five.

29:16.019 --> 29:18.229
Some fives. That's not good.

29:18.396 --> 29:21.357
Keep with the flossing.
We'll see you in three months.

29:21.691 --> 29:25.694
Six. Six. Six.

29:25.862 --> 29:28.531
I'm gonna recommend
you see a periodontist.

29:28.698 --> 29:30.825
He'll probably recommend
gum surgery.

29:37.082 --> 29:40.459
- Hello?
- Hey, I'm so glad I finally got you.

29:40.627 --> 29:43.754
- Hello, who is this?
- It's Caden.

29:43.922 --> 29:45.756
Ellen?

29:46.258 --> 29:49.885
It's Caden. I can't wait to see you
and Olive on the 12th...

29:50.053 --> 29:54.974
No, I have to go.
I'm sorry, there's a party. I'm famous.

29:55.142 --> 29:56.517
Have fun...

30:12.075 --> 30:14.034
911, state your emergency.

30:14.202 --> 30:16.245
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Ma'am?

30:40.770 --> 30:42.021
Mr. Cotard?

30:58.914 --> 31:00.998
Mr. Cotard.

31:11.092 --> 31:13.552
You've had a seizure of sorts.

31:15.931 --> 31:16.972
What does that mean?

31:17.140 --> 31:21.310
Seems to be some synaptic
degradation, fungal in origin.

31:21.478 --> 31:23.646
Autonomic functions
are going haywire.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.649
You'll lose your ability
to salivate, cry, et cetera.

31:26.816 --> 31:31.070
- Is it serious?
- We don't know. But, yes.

31:31.738 --> 31:34.073
We'll get you enrolled
in some biofeedback program.

31:34.241 --> 31:37.159
Maybe you can learn
some sort of manual override.

31:49.381 --> 31:52.341
We should get a drink.
It would be fun.

31:52.509 --> 31:58.347
- It would be weird.
- I like weird. I like you. See?

31:59.683 --> 32:02.476
Anyway, I don't wanna
make you uncomfortable, I...

32:04.688 --> 32:08.274
Okay, so I do
wanna make you uncomfortable.

32:19.577 --> 32:21.620
And what do we do with all this?

32:24.624 --> 32:28.002
You wanna come over to my place,
Cotard?

32:31.756 --> 32:35.843
I won't let you off the hook this time
by saying, "Never mind. "

32:36.011 --> 32:38.554
Adele is only on vacation.

32:38.722 --> 32:43.225
She hasn't called since she left.
It's been a year.

32:43.768 --> 32:46.020
It's been a week.

32:47.897 --> 32:50.441
I'm gonna buy you a calendar.

32:58.908 --> 33:00.826
Okay.

33:03.413 --> 33:05.456
Just for one drink.

33:09.127 --> 33:12.171
Come on. Scraps for my scrapbook.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.763
I can't... I really can't drink very much
because of my condition.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.107
Did you put something in it?

33:32.275 --> 33:36.528
If that's what it takes,
consider it done.

33:38.573 --> 33:41.658
Love potion number 69.

33:44.746 --> 33:47.206
- It's good.
- Does it make you wanna kiss me?

33:48.458 --> 33:51.919
- Kind of.
- Tell me why.

33:52.504 --> 33:55.631
Because I feel a lot of longing.

33:55.799 --> 33:58.384
Beg a girl, why don't you?

33:58.635 --> 34:00.469
- Please, Hazel.
- On your knees.

34:02.097 --> 34:03.764
What?

34:03.932 --> 34:07.768
I want you to beg me
on your knees for a kiss.

34:07.936 --> 34:09.520
Just for fun.

34:12.815 --> 34:14.315
Why am I doing this?

34:16.277 --> 34:18.152
For fun, baby.

34:21.908 --> 34:24.701
Will you help me
forget my troubles?

34:25.203 --> 34:27.079
Oh, kiddo.

34:28.998 --> 34:30.331
You don't even know.

34:34.670 --> 34:37.089
- What?
- I don't know.

34:37.424 --> 34:40.467
- What is it?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

34:42.344 --> 34:44.221
I'm sorry.

34:46.181 --> 34:48.851
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just...

34:51.103 --> 34:54.273
I'm just really confused.

34:54.899 --> 34:56.775
I'm sorry.

34:57.694 --> 34:59.236
I...

35:03.116 --> 35:06.452
I'm really sick.

35:08.037 --> 35:10.539
And I think I'm dying.

35:12.208 --> 35:16.170
I have a kid, and I'm married.

35:21.092 --> 35:26.180
I just thought
this might change things, you know?

35:26.347 --> 35:31.059
I had a good time,
and I think you're a very nice person.

35:32.395 --> 35:36.106
That is just the wrong thing
to say right now, Caden.

35:48.578 --> 35:50.537
You should go.

35:56.461 --> 35:59.588
Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

36:00.173 --> 36:02.633
Hi. You know,
I haven't heard from you in a while...

36:02.800 --> 36:05.427
...and I just thought I'd call
and say hi.

36:05.595 --> 36:07.429
Hi, Hazel.

36:13.436 --> 36:16.271
Now. Now. Be here now.

36:17.357 --> 36:19.650
Olive wanted me to ask you
not to read her diary.

36:19.817 --> 36:23.403
She left it under her pillow
by mistake.

36:41.047 --> 36:43.590
Dear Mr. Cotard,
it is my pleasure to inform you...

36:43.758 --> 36:46.593
...that you have been named
a 2009 MacArthur Fellow.

36:46.761 --> 36:50.055
It is our hope that you will use
your newly found financial freedom...

36:50.223 --> 36:53.308
...to create something unflinchingly
true, profoundly beautiful...

36:53.476 --> 36:56.353
...and of unremitting value
to your community and to the world.

36:56.521 --> 36:58.355
- I got this MacArthur grant.
- Oh, Caden.

36:58.523 --> 37:01.191
- Yeah, a lot of money.
- Know what you're gonna do with it?

37:01.359 --> 37:05.737
Theater piece.
Something big and true and tough.

37:05.905 --> 37:08.156
I'm gonna finally put my real self
into something.

37:08.658 --> 37:12.578
What is your real self, do you think?

37:13.454 --> 37:15.372
I don't know yet.

37:16.666 --> 37:19.334
The MacArthur is called
"the genius grant"...

37:19.502 --> 37:21.503
...and I wanna earn it.

37:21.671 --> 37:24.298
That's wonderful. God bless.

37:24.465 --> 37:27.801
I guess you'll have to discover
your real self, right?

37:27.969 --> 37:29.511
Yeah.

37:30.722 --> 37:33.640
I wanted to ask you, how old are kids
when they start to write?

37:33.808 --> 37:36.685
There's an absolutely brilliant novel
written by a 4-year-old.

37:36.853 --> 37:40.522
- Really?
- Little Winky by Horace Azpiazu.

37:40.690 --> 37:42.316
- That's cute.
- Oh, hardly.

37:42.483 --> 37:44.901
Little Winky
is a virulent anti-Semite.

37:45.069 --> 37:48.280
The story follows his initiation
into the Klan...

37:48.448 --> 37:51.366
...his immersion
in the pornographic snuff industry...

37:51.534 --> 37:54.786
...and his ultimate degradation
at the hands of a black ex-convict...

37:54.954 --> 37:58.665
...named Eric Washington Jackson
Jones Johnson...

37:58.833 --> 38:00.792
- Written by a 4-year-old?
... Jefferson.

38:02.837 --> 38:04.087
Written by a 4-year-old?

38:04.255 --> 38:06.506
Well, Azpiazu killed himself
when he was 5.

38:06.674 --> 38:09.635
- Why did he kill himself?
- I don't know. Why did you?

38:09.802 --> 38:11.303
What?

38:11.721 --> 38:13.305
I said, why would you?

38:14.724 --> 38:16.683
Oh, I don't know.

38:19.646 --> 38:23.231
Yeah, I wanna bring my production
to New York...

38:23.399 --> 38:28.403
...to get it seen by people,
you know, who matter.

38:28.738 --> 38:31.365
- The sooner the better.
- This theater, centrally located.

38:31.532 --> 38:34.409
Heart of the theater district,
so, you know, great for plays.

38:34.577 --> 38:38.955
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely. There it is.

38:40.249 --> 38:43.085
- What was this used for?
- Plays.

38:45.004 --> 38:48.674
- Like, theater plays?
- Shakespeare.

38:50.426 --> 38:52.302
King Lear.

38:52.637 --> 38:54.554
The storm.

38:55.515 --> 38:59.476
You see, the idea
is to do a massive theater piece.

38:59.686 --> 39:02.938
You know, uncompromising, honest.

39:05.024 --> 39:09.194
Here's what I think theater is.
It's the beginning of thought.

39:10.154 --> 39:12.572
It's the truth not yet spoken.

39:12.740 --> 39:16.410
It's what a man feels like
after he's been clocked in the jaw.

39:17.161 --> 39:22.082
It's love in all its messiness.

39:22.792 --> 39:26.378
You know, and I want all of us,
players and patrons alike...

39:26.546 --> 39:30.465
...to soak
in the communal bath of it...

39:30.633 --> 39:34.469
...the mikvah, as the Jews call it.

39:34.637 --> 39:40.142
Because we're all in the same water,
after all.

39:40.518 --> 39:46.648
You know, soaking
in our very menstrual blood...

39:46.816 --> 39:48.650
...and nocturnal emissions.

39:49.485 --> 39:51.945
This is what I wanna try
to give people.

39:52.405 --> 39:55.407
Okay, here you go.
Here's your salad.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.120
- Here's your soup.
- Thanks.

40:02.123 --> 40:04.541
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

40:10.673 --> 40:14.426
- What are you doing?
- Salivating.

40:15.178 --> 40:17.679
The biofeedback training.

40:20.975 --> 40:23.518
- So I was wondering if you'd help.
- In your box office?

40:23.686 --> 40:27.606
No, as my assistant.

40:27.815 --> 40:30.484
I'm not sure I can work with you,
Caden.

40:31.903 --> 40:33.195
I'm kind of angry.

40:34.113 --> 40:36.281
I just wanna normalize it.

40:39.035 --> 40:41.578
I think we'd have a lot of fun
together.

40:55.176 --> 40:57.260
I miss you.

40:58.554 --> 41:00.806
- Really disturbing.
- I know.

41:03.726 --> 41:07.062
Dear diary, thank you
for being my new best friend.

41:07.230 --> 41:10.982
My name is Olive Cotard,
and I'm 4 years old.

41:11.150 --> 41:13.527
I like chocolate,
and my favorite color is pink.

41:17.031 --> 41:19.074
This is pink.

41:21.494 --> 41:23.829
Yeah, that's good.

41:23.996 --> 41:25.914
- Next.
- Hi.

41:33.506 --> 41:35.549
We'll start by talking honestly...

41:35.716 --> 41:39.594
...and out of that,
a piece of theater will evolve.

41:40.429 --> 41:42.097
I'll begin.

41:44.517 --> 41:46.852
I've been thinking a lot
about dying lately.

41:47.270 --> 41:51.064
- You're gonna be fine, sweetie.
- Well, I appreciate that, Claire, but...

41:51.232 --> 41:52.315
You are, you poor thing.

41:52.483 --> 41:56.987
Yeah, well, regardless of how
this particular thing works itself out...

41:57.613 --> 42:00.240
...I will be dying.

42:01.617 --> 42:03.743
And so will you.

42:05.121 --> 42:07.414
And so will everyone here.

42:11.294 --> 42:13.920
And that's what I wanna explore.

42:14.088 --> 42:16.548
We're all hurtling towards death.

42:20.511 --> 42:23.805
Yet here we are,
for the moment, alive...

42:24.515 --> 42:26.725
...each of us knowing
we're gonna die...

42:28.728 --> 42:31.438
...each of us
secretly believing we won't.

42:32.815 --> 42:34.816
It's brilliant.

42:36.277 --> 42:38.987
It's everything.

42:40.406 --> 42:42.824
It's Karamazov.

42:47.538 --> 42:49.831
- Stop.
- I'm just asking.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.667
- You're so obnoxious.
- You're so obnoxious.

42:53.336 --> 42:55.879
- You do not wanna cross me.
- Don't I?

43:01.344 --> 43:03.178
Hi, Claire.

43:04.013 --> 43:06.932
- Hi.
- Hazel.

43:07.099 --> 43:09.935
Yeah. No, no. I know, I know. Hazel.
You're the box office.

43:10.102 --> 43:12.604
- Yeah, I'm the box office.
- How are you?

43:12.813 --> 43:15.023
Wonderful. You?

43:15.191 --> 43:17.108
Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm fine.
Thank you.

43:17.610 --> 43:21.196
Actually, I'm meeting Caden here.
You know Mr. Cotard, right?

43:21.364 --> 43:24.115
Yes, I recall Mr. Cotard.

43:26.035 --> 43:27.243
Yeah. I'm waiting...

43:33.042 --> 43:35.502
- Hey.
- Hi, Caden.

43:35.670 --> 43:38.588
- Hi, Caden.
- Hi, Hazel. Hi, Claire.

43:38.756 --> 43:40.590
Hi.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.634
- This is Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

43:42.802 --> 43:45.553
- Hi, Derek.
- Hi, Derek.

43:45.721 --> 43:46.763
Hi.

43:50.726 --> 43:54.104
Well, we'll leave you be.
It's nice to see you again.

43:54.271 --> 43:58.066
- Take care.
- Why am I bowing? Okay, bye.

44:01.195 --> 44:04.739
- That was awkward.
- Yeah, I guess.

44:07.201 --> 44:08.243
Do you like beaver...?

44:08.411 --> 44:11.413
So could you tell me maybe
what it is that you want from me?

44:13.416 --> 44:15.750
You know, like, from my character.

44:18.045 --> 44:20.714
Well, we'll build it over time
together.

44:20.881 --> 44:23.925
You know, try to find a real person,
maybe, to model it after.

44:24.093 --> 44:26.428
That Hazel girl's
kind of interesting maybe.

44:26.595 --> 44:28.304
- You know, like, why...?
- Although...

44:28.472 --> 44:30.890
Why is she still working
at a box office at her age?

44:31.058 --> 44:33.101
I don't know.
Probably not that interesting.

44:33.269 --> 44:36.271
Maybe she wanted to be an actress,
but she lacked the confidence.

44:36.439 --> 44:38.690
- Yeah, we'll talk about it.
- I'm so excited.

44:38.858 --> 44:40.483
Really? Why?

44:42.111 --> 44:45.780
Because I think that it's brave.

44:45.948 --> 44:50.535
And I just feel like
I'm gonna be part of a revolution.

44:50.703 --> 44:53.830
I keep thinking about Artaud,
Krapp's Last Tape...

44:53.998 --> 44:57.125
...you know, and Grotowski,
for chrissake.

44:57.293 --> 44:59.419
I don't know what I'm doing.

45:00.337 --> 45:01.963
But that's what so refreshing.

45:02.131 --> 45:04.382
Knowing that you don't know...

45:04.550 --> 45:08.970
...is the first and the most essential
step to knowing, you know?

45:09.930 --> 45:11.848
I don't know.

45:16.479 --> 45:19.105
- Well, I'm proud of you.
- Thanks.

45:19.273 --> 45:21.232
- Don't say that, not to me.
- Oh, sorry.

45:23.819 --> 45:26.237
My mother died last night.

45:27.323 --> 45:32.911
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
What are you doing out?

45:36.499 --> 45:39.667
- This is me.
- Well...

45:40.169 --> 45:43.755
Well, it was nice meeting you.
Oh, God, did I just say "meeting"?

45:43.923 --> 45:48.927
- I'm sorry. I'm so stupid.
- Slip of the tongue, is all.

45:49.136 --> 45:51.846
Yeah, it's a Freudian slip, right?

45:53.015 --> 45:54.974
I don't know how it's Freudian.

45:55.142 --> 46:00.021
To meet, you know? Like, to meet.

46:03.859 --> 46:08.071
There she met Ralph Keene.
They fell in love, married...

46:08.239 --> 46:10.698
...and soon their first child,
Claire, was born.

46:11.242 --> 46:12.992
I used to be a baby.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.995
Claire Elizabeth Keene
was a joyous child...

46:16.163 --> 46:18.873
- I'm sorry.
... the apple of her mother's eye.

46:19.041 --> 46:23.586
She made her parents proud with her
politeness and gymnastic skills.

46:23.754 --> 46:25.922
God, you're beautiful.

46:26.090 --> 46:30.093
When she was 7, little Claire
was bitten by the acting bug.

46:30.261 --> 46:33.012
She starred
in almost every school musical...

46:33.180 --> 46:35.390
...playing Ado Annie in Oklahoma...

46:35.558 --> 46:40.395
...Adelaide in Guys And Dolls,
and Maria in The Sound Of Music.

46:40.563 --> 46:44.149
I have to fuck you. I have to.

46:48.487 --> 46:51.364
There will be no other before you.

46:56.579 --> 46:58.913
I'd like to buy a ticket, please.

46:59.081 --> 47:02.584
- Okay. Hold it.
- That'll be $40.

47:04.670 --> 47:08.673
We're not really...
We need to investigate.

47:09.133 --> 47:12.594
You know, to really discover
the essence of each being.

47:14.430 --> 47:17.515
You know, I think I need to work
with both of you separately.

47:17.683 --> 47:19.851
Davis, I'll start with you.

47:21.437 --> 47:25.773
I liked the beginning.
I don't wanna see a good scene...

47:25.941 --> 47:27.609
"Davis, I'll start with you"?

47:27.776 --> 47:31.112
There's a difference between favoring
me and pretending we've never met.

47:31.280 --> 47:34.157
I mean, we've had Ariel.
I think people know that we've fucked.

47:35.284 --> 47:38.953
We'll talk about your character
after we put Ariel to bed, okay?

47:39.663 --> 47:40.788
Okay.

47:48.505 --> 47:51.049
I think I made a breakthrough.

47:51.217 --> 47:54.886
- This character is so beautiful...
- Yeah, I have to go find my daughter.

47:55.262 --> 47:57.388
- Your daughter's right here.
- My real daughter.

47:57.556 --> 48:00.308
- Excuse me?
- I mean, my first daughter, Olive.

48:00.476 --> 48:03.478
- I have to go find her.
- Please don't do this to us.

48:03.646 --> 48:05.980
She's tattooed. She's tattooed.

48:06.148 --> 48:08.816
Oh, everyone is tattooed.

48:09.068 --> 48:11.819
Oh, I've never seen that before.

48:12.196 --> 48:16.032
- You have responsibilities.
- Yeah, I'll be quick. I'll do it quick.

48:16.200 --> 48:20.203
Redundancy is fluid.
Life moves to the south.

48:20.371 --> 48:23.998
There is only the now,
and I am always with you.

48:24.166 --> 48:26.501
For example, look to your left.

48:27.962 --> 48:29.671
Hi.

48:30.422 --> 48:35.134
When you canceled, it freed me up,
so I'm traveling too.

48:39.181 --> 48:42.183
You know,
I'm not sure I'm getting the book.

48:51.860 --> 48:57.865
Oh, but it's getting you.
You're almost non-recognizable now.

49:03.080 --> 49:04.872
Thank you.

49:10.045 --> 49:15.425
I show you my leg. I stand close,
and you inhale my perfume.

49:15.592 --> 49:19.262
I offer my ripe flower to you
and you deny it.

49:19.430 --> 49:21.806
This book is over.

49:36.196 --> 49:37.572
Hi.

49:38.073 --> 49:39.407
I don't speak German.

49:39.575 --> 49:41.826
Yeah, yeah. I may help you, mister?

49:42.411 --> 49:45.413
I'm looking for Adele Cotard.
Adele Lack.

49:45.581 --> 49:48.583
We must not give addresses
or other personal informations.

49:49.126 --> 49:52.420
- I'm her husband.
- No, you are not her husbands...

49:52.588 --> 49:54.881
...which is named Gunther
und Heinz.

49:55.049 --> 49:57.550
I'm the father of her daughter, Olive.

49:57.968 --> 50:01.929
I see. I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

50:02.097 --> 50:07.018
Dear diary, Germany is wonderful.
So many friends here.

50:07.186 --> 50:09.437
My new dads are great
and handsome...

50:09.605 --> 50:11.856
...and brilliant directors of theater.

50:12.024 --> 50:13.691
Hello.

50:18.322 --> 50:19.364
You're here?

50:19.531 --> 50:23.826
Yeah. I live with Adele and Olive
and Gunther and Heinz...

50:23.994 --> 50:28.206
...and Uschi and Britt.
I'm everyone's nanny.

50:28.374 --> 50:30.541
I wanna see my daughter.

50:31.210 --> 50:34.253
- Yeah, they sent me.
- They?

50:35.881 --> 50:38.508
Who are they?
Who the fuck are Uschi and Britt?

50:38.675 --> 50:41.302
Yeah, they decided it's not time
to see you yet.

50:41.470 --> 50:44.055
They decided? Who decided?
They had her tattooed.

50:44.473 --> 50:46.599
Oh, I did that. Olive is my project...

50:46.767 --> 50:49.060
She's a 4-year-old!

50:49.478 --> 50:52.980
She's a fucking 4-year-old!

50:56.485 --> 50:59.070
She's almost over 11 now.

51:02.199 --> 51:03.741
She's my muse.

51:04.743 --> 51:06.285
I love her.

51:10.082 --> 51:12.250
You don't love her!

51:14.211 --> 51:16.003
Where is she?

51:17.172 --> 51:20.174
What did you do to my daughter?

52:18.066 --> 52:22.361
Death comes faster than you think.

52:24.406 --> 52:28.075
- That was your last patient for the day.
- Let's stop this charade.

52:28.243 --> 52:30.369
I don't know
what you're talking about, doctor.

52:30.537 --> 52:32.914
You're actually having an affair
off set.

52:33.081 --> 52:34.790
- Palpable, huh?
- Oh, okay.

52:34.958 --> 52:37.418
- Who told you?
- And it's not good.

52:37.586 --> 52:40.087
- Not good, oh, okay.
- You're actors playing actors.

52:40.255 --> 52:43.758
You're in this scene, you're not
just filming it. You're in this scene.

52:43.926 --> 52:45.051
Just like that...

52:45.219 --> 52:48.137
As you're telling him this,
you realize you're attracted to him.

52:48.305 --> 52:49.764
How are you gonna let him know?

52:49.932 --> 52:53.184
And the guilt you feel about telling him
about somebody else knowing.

52:53.352 --> 52:55.269
Daddy, Daddy is mine.

52:55.437 --> 52:57.772
Daddy can't play now, honey.

52:57.940 --> 53:01.442
Daddy doesn't live with us anymore,
baby. He had to go find himself.

53:02.110 --> 53:04.111
They still feel a little tight in the toe.

53:04.279 --> 53:08.449
Have an argument.
You're having an argument. Have it.

53:08.700 --> 53:11.536
- I don't buy it.
- You, sir, are a horse's ass.

53:11.703 --> 53:15.248
What? Just get the fucking shoe.
You gave me two sizes too big.

53:15.415 --> 53:19.252
Tom, don't turn into another person
just because I say change your action.

53:19.419 --> 53:24.924
And this started just today?
It never happened before?

53:25.384 --> 53:27.552
Okay. Good.

53:27.719 --> 53:29.679
You can get dressed.

53:32.933 --> 53:36.143
I mean, you're a doctor, right?
Am I dying? Can you tell me that?

53:36.311 --> 53:38.938
- No.
- No, you can't tell me?

53:39.106 --> 53:42.400
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me if you can't tell me?

53:42.568 --> 53:44.360
- No.
- No, you can't tell me...

53:44.528 --> 53:48.281
...because you're not allowed to?
- No.

54:12.973 --> 54:16.100
- Caden.
- What are you doing here?

54:17.853 --> 54:20.563
I was wondering
if I was gonna bump into you.

54:20.731 --> 54:22.773
- You look great.
- Thanks.

54:22.941 --> 54:26.444
- Is that a new haircut?
- Yeah. For a while now.

54:27.321 --> 54:29.363
What are you doing in New York?

54:29.531 --> 54:32.908
I'm here with Derek and the boys.
A mini vacation.

54:33.076 --> 54:36.454
- The boys?
- Yeah. I thought you knew.

54:37.372 --> 54:40.207
- How old?
- Five.

54:40.375 --> 54:43.711
Twins. Robert and Daniel and Alan.

54:45.797 --> 54:47.465
Yes.

54:48.342 --> 54:51.427
They're nice names.
Where are they?

54:51.595 --> 54:56.057
Derek took them to the Natural History
so I could shop.

54:58.685 --> 55:02.480
It's so good to see you, Caden.
L... How are things?

55:02.648 --> 55:06.067
You know, I was with Claire.

55:06.401 --> 55:10.196
And we have a daughter.
But we're separated.

55:11.239 --> 55:13.240
How about with you?

55:14.409 --> 55:17.912
Good. I have a great job
at Lens Shapers.

55:18.080 --> 55:21.999
Shapers. Great. You wear a lab coat.

55:24.628 --> 55:28.089
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Hazel.

55:58.954 --> 56:01.205
Hey! What are you doing?

56:03.250 --> 56:04.750
- I got you.
- Let me go.

56:04.918 --> 56:06.043
How I love Maria.

56:06.211 --> 56:09.672
She is so much more of a father
than Caden ever was...

56:09.840 --> 56:14.176
...with his drinking and unfortunate
body odor and rotting teeth.

56:14.344 --> 56:18.305
I could only loathe him,
and perhaps pity him.

56:18.473 --> 56:20.433
But Maria.

56:23.812 --> 56:25.813
I wanna come back.

56:25.981 --> 56:30.651
I wanna take care of you and Olive.
Ariel. Ariel. Fuck.

56:33.613 --> 56:35.322
Ariel.

56:45.250 --> 56:47.668
No, no, no, it's so late. Please.

56:47.836 --> 56:49.044
No, no, no. Please.

56:51.840 --> 56:53.340
Hello?

56:57.137 --> 56:58.179
Okay.

57:08.774 --> 57:10.983
My father died.

57:14.696 --> 57:16.530
Oh, baby.

57:21.036 --> 57:25.456
They said his body was riddled
with cancer and that he didn't know.

57:25.624 --> 57:27.875
That he went in
because his finger hurt.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.879
They said he suffered horribly.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.550
And that he...

57:38.970 --> 57:42.181
That he called out for me
before he died.

57:43.391 --> 57:48.103
They said that he said
he regretted his life.

57:50.273 --> 57:53.192
And they said he said a lot of things.

57:54.361 --> 57:56.237
Too many to recount.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.740
They said it was the longest...

57:59.908 --> 58:04.119
...and saddest deathbed speech
any of them had ever heard.

58:04.746 --> 58:07.206
There was so little left of him...

58:07.916 --> 58:11.085
...they had to fill the coffin
with cotton balls...

58:11.253 --> 58:13.712
...to keep him from rattling around.

58:20.011 --> 58:22.012
I'm really sorry for your loss.

58:22.180 --> 58:24.348
Thank you.
Can you excuse me a moment?

58:24.516 --> 58:28.102
- Of course.
- I need to use the bathroom.

58:28.270 --> 58:29.979
- All right.
- Okay.

58:31.106 --> 58:33.732
God bless you and your family.

58:33.900 --> 58:36.193
God bless you. Will you excuse me?

58:38.697 --> 58:42.366
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

58:48.248 --> 58:50.040
It's left five people dead.

58:50.208 --> 58:51.834
Sorry.

58:53.628 --> 58:55.462
- Caden?
- Hi, Derek.

58:55.714 --> 58:57.923
Officials suspect arson.

58:58.091 --> 59:00.676
In other news,
German pharmaceutical giant...

59:00.844 --> 59:02.928
...has won its libel suit
against patients...

59:03.096 --> 59:06.390
...claiming chromosomal damage
from use of the arthritis medication...

59:06.558 --> 59:10.978
Will you just tell me what to do?

59:14.399 --> 59:17.026
In Pakistan today, the government...

59:26.202 --> 59:30.164
Caden, everyone has to figure out
their own life, you know.

59:30.916 --> 59:33.167
I just want you to look at me
the way you used to.

59:33.335 --> 59:36.754
Oh, honey, I can't anymore.

59:37.339 --> 59:39.298
You know I'm sorry.

59:40.467 --> 59:45.054
I screwed everything up,
and I don't have any courage.

59:45.597 --> 59:48.807
- And I'm sorry.
- Caden.

59:50.018 --> 59:54.021
- I'm okay.
- I don't want you to be okay.

59:54.189 --> 59:59.109
I mean, I do, but it just...

59:59.527 --> 01:00:01.654
It rips my guts out.

01:00:01.821 --> 01:00:03.864
I'll help you through any way I can.

01:00:04.574 --> 01:00:06.825
And I'll help you through too.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.038
I'm fine.

01:00:12.082 --> 01:00:13.374
I have Derek.

01:00:20.882 --> 01:00:23.050
Okay, I'm going.

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:31.976
Honey, I'm coming.

01:00:32.394 --> 01:00:36.230
Dear diary, today I felt a wetness
between my legs.

01:00:36.398 --> 01:00:39.483
Maria explained to me
now I am a woman.

01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:43.237
And being a woman is wonderful
with Maria to guide me.

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.875
Olive?

01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:45.424
Olive.

01:01:47.052 --> 01:01:55.309
Olive, it's Daddy.

01:01:56.811 --> 01:02:00.814
Olive, it's Daddy! Olive, it's Daddy!

01:02:00.982 --> 01:02:04.318
Don't fucking stare at me! Olive!

01:02:04.486 --> 01:02:09.156
Get off! It's my daughter!
That's my daughter!

01:02:09.991 --> 01:02:14.244
Get off! Get off!

01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:21.752
I won't settle for anything less
than the brutal truth.

01:02:22.712 --> 01:02:26.381
Brutal. Brutal.

01:02:27.634 --> 01:02:31.178
Each day I'll hand you a paper. It'll tell
you what happened to you that day.

01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:32.846
You felt a lump in your breast.

01:02:33.014 --> 01:02:35.641
You looked at your wife
and saw a stranger, et cetera.

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:38.477
- Caden?
- What?

01:02:38.853 --> 01:02:41.522
When are we gonna
get an audience in here?

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:44.274
It's been 17 years.

01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:50.864
All right, I'm not excusing myself
from this either.

01:02:51.032 --> 01:02:53.200
I will have someone play me...

01:02:53.368 --> 01:02:56.036
...to delve into the murky,
cowardly depths...

01:02:56.204 --> 01:03:00.374
...of my lonely, fucked-up being.

01:03:01.751 --> 01:03:04.753
And he'll get notes too,
and those notes will correspond...

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:10.300
...to the notes I truly receive
every day from my god.

01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:18.225
Get to work!

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.042
They fired me.

01:03:46.129 --> 01:03:49.464
- I caused an outbreak of conjunctivitis.
- Oh, God.

01:03:49.632 --> 01:03:52.092
I didn't wash my hands.
I had pinkeye hands.

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.887
- Oh, God.
- I'm a stupid cow.

01:03:55.054 --> 01:03:58.932
Fucking private Christian school
is killing us. You know, it's not cheap.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.019
It's Derek's thing.
I don't believe in that shit, you know.

01:04:02.187 --> 01:04:04.855
You try to be a good person.
I mean, that's all there is.

01:04:07.192 --> 01:04:09.276
Do you have anything for me,
Caden?

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.657
I mean, I already have an assistant.

01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:20.454
- I don't have a box office yet, but...
- Please, caden.

01:04:20.622 --> 01:04:22.664
Please, Caden. I...

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:25.959
Please, Caden.

01:04:29.881 --> 01:04:32.674
Sammy Barnathan?

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.562
Sit. Sammy Barnathan.

01:04:55.865 --> 01:04:59.618
I don't have a résumé or a picture.

01:05:01.162 --> 01:05:05.165
- I've never worked as an actor.
- Good. Tell me why you're here.

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:07.417
Well, I've been...

01:05:08.628 --> 01:05:11.463
I've been following you for 20 years.

01:05:11.923 --> 01:05:15.008
So I knew about this audition
because I follow you.

01:05:15.385 --> 01:05:18.178
And I've learned everything about you
by following you.

01:05:18.596 --> 01:05:22.766
So hire me,
and you'll see who you truly are.

01:05:25.687 --> 01:05:26.937
Peekaboo.

01:05:30.817 --> 01:05:32.359
Okay.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.074
Hazel, I don't think we need to talk to
anyone else. This guy has me down.

01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:43.370
I'm gonna cast him right now.
Then maybe you and I can get a drink.

01:05:43.538 --> 01:05:45.956
And we can try to figure out
this thing between us...

01:05:46.124 --> 01:05:48.000
...why I cried.

01:05:48.209 --> 01:05:54.548
Because I've never felt about anybody
the way I feel about you.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:59.553
And I wanna fuck you
until we merge into a chimera...

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:04.891
...a mythical beast with penis
and vagina eternally fused...

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.520
...two pairs of eyes
that look only at each other...

01:06:08.938 --> 01:06:12.941
...and lips ever touching.

01:06:13.901 --> 01:06:18.363
And one voice that whispers to itself.

01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:32.669
Okay.

01:06:33.546 --> 01:06:36.840
Yeah. You've got the part.

01:06:56.611 --> 01:06:59.446
I've never seen your shit gray.

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:02.366
It's new.

01:07:06.662 --> 01:07:08.121
That's a good boy.

01:07:14.754 --> 01:07:18.131
- When is it opening?
- When it's ready.

01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:22.344
- We need to get in. It's bad out here.
- Sorry.

01:07:26.474 --> 01:07:29.518
You know, I was thinking
of calling it Simulacrum.

01:07:30.395 --> 01:07:33.438
I don't even know what it means.

01:07:33.731 --> 01:07:38.318
Can I have a nickel if I doesn't play
with my pee-pee no more?

01:07:38.903 --> 01:07:40.612
Yeah.

01:07:42.949 --> 01:07:45.492
How about
The Flawed Light of Love and Grief?

01:07:45.701 --> 01:07:47.160
I'm not sure.

01:07:49.163 --> 01:07:52.082
Claire, I want you to play yourself.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.001
Sammy's gonna move
into your apartment set as me.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.591
It would be my honor
to play your husband, Claire.

01:08:01.759 --> 01:08:03.677
You're an amazing actress.

01:08:03.845 --> 01:08:07.722
No, I saw you do Bernarda Alba
last year at the Roundabout.

01:08:08.307 --> 01:08:09.850
Yeah?

01:08:10.435 --> 01:08:12.018
That was a fun play.

01:08:12.186 --> 01:08:17.149
Emotionally, it was tough,
but fucking fulfilling.

01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:20.694
Plus, I loved working
with so many strong female actresses.

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:27.826
I'm gonna start thinking
about myself.

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.038
Start, huh?

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:38.377
Who is Claire Keen?
Claire Keen. Claire Keen.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:42.549
- Why did we leave Adele, Caden?
- Claire Keen. Well...

01:08:44.426 --> 01:08:46.553
She left us.

01:08:48.346 --> 01:08:50.890
You know that better than anybody.

01:08:51.893 --> 01:08:53.685
Except me.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:58.064
An amazing artist though.
The best living artist.

01:08:58.232 --> 01:09:01.902
I mean, there's no one who stares
the truth in the face like she does.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:04.904
Sweet pussy too.

01:09:07.325 --> 01:09:09.326
How do you know that?

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:14.997
I read it.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:23.423
Anyway...

01:09:25.593 --> 01:09:28.053
I mean, I don't know where she is.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.932
Well, maybe she's got a sublet
in New York.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:37.604
Maybe she's got a retrospective
at the Met. Maybe, baby.

01:09:44.946 --> 01:09:46.196
Why are you giving me this?

01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:50.992
I wanna follow you there and see
how you lose even more of yourself.

01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:55.038
Research.

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:59.209
You know, for the part.

01:10:00.127 --> 01:10:01.795
Partner.

01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:53.096
Hold it. Hold it, please.

01:10:53.264 --> 01:10:55.140
Hold it, please.

01:10:57.977 --> 01:11:00.854
I asked you to hold the door.

01:11:01.188 --> 01:11:04.024
I'm sorry. I pressed the button,
but I think it was too late.

01:11:04.191 --> 01:11:06.026
You didn't press it.

01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:10.989
- Have a good night.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:11:13.326 --> 01:11:15.535
- Are you Ellen? Ellen?
- What?

01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:17.621
- Are you Ellen Bascomb?
- What?

01:11:17.788 --> 01:11:20.206
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

01:11:22.293 --> 01:11:23.335
Yes, I'm Ellen.

01:11:23.502 --> 01:11:25.754
She said you should just go ahead
and get started.

01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:29.215
- And don't forget to change the sheets.
- Okay, thanks.

01:11:30.801 --> 01:11:32.510
Oh, sweetheart.

01:11:44.357 --> 01:11:56.618
Adele?

01:12:01.374 --> 01:12:06.419
Hi, Ellen. Be a doll and do the sheets
and whatever's in the hamper.

01:12:06.921 --> 01:12:09.547
Your money's under the toaster.
Kisses, Adele.

01:12:09.715 --> 01:12:13.593
P.S. Bag of stuff in bedroom closet
for Goodwill. Take what you want.

01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:41.579
Went for a walk. I had to think.

01:12:50.589 --> 01:12:52.298
All night?

01:12:53.259 --> 01:12:58.138
You smell weird.
Are you wearing lipstick?

01:12:58.431 --> 01:12:59.931
No.

01:13:01.559 --> 01:13:03.893
What do I smell like?

01:13:05.646 --> 01:13:07.981
Like bad? Like an old person?

01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:10.233
I don't know.
Like mold and cleaning products.

01:13:10.401 --> 01:13:12.318
Like you're menstruating.
I don't know.

01:13:12.486 --> 01:13:14.112
Menstruating?

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:15.739
You tell me.

01:13:16.323 --> 01:13:19.659
I don't menstruate. I don't know how
I could smell like I'm menstruating.

01:13:20.035 --> 01:13:21.453
I wouldn't know.

01:13:33.007 --> 01:13:34.883
I don't like the guy you got
to play you.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:37.135
You don't like Sammy? Why?
I think he's good.

01:13:39.013 --> 01:13:42.515
Fuck you. I'm 45 years old.
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

01:13:42.683 --> 01:13:44.684
He's the best thing in the play
except you.

01:13:44.852 --> 01:13:47.687
He's coming on to me.
He's grabbing my ass in rehearsal.

01:13:47.855 --> 01:13:49.481
- He's your husband.
- Good, Jimmy.

01:13:49.648 --> 01:13:51.357
He's not my goddamn husband.
You are.

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:53.943
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:13:55.696 --> 01:13:57.822
- I'm going to rehearsal.
- It's about the play.

01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:01.117
- We're getting at something real here.
- That's great, you guys.

01:14:01.285 --> 01:14:03.119
Beautiful, Sammy.

01:14:05.915 --> 01:14:09.584
- Caden? Time-out?
- Yeah.

01:14:09.752 --> 01:14:11.336
What's up?

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:15.298
Well, I feel we need a Hazel in here.

01:14:15.925 --> 01:14:19.177
I mean, there's a whole side of Caden
I can't explore without a Hazel.

01:14:21.597 --> 01:14:23.807
- I guess, yeah.
- I get to be a character?

01:14:23.974 --> 01:14:25.391
Yeah.

01:14:30.689 --> 01:14:34.859
Hi, Ellen.
Crackerjack job last night.

01:14:35.736 --> 01:14:37.320
Would you do sheets again?

01:14:37.488 --> 01:14:41.699
We had quite a fuck,
and it's musky and gross. Kisses, A.

01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:45.578
Hi, Adele. Relined the cabinets.

01:14:45.746 --> 01:14:48.915
I just wanted to let you know
I won a MacArthur Grant.

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:52.919
And I'm mounting a play which
I think is gonna be pure and truthful.

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:56.089
Best, Ellen.

01:15:02.012 --> 01:15:04.931
I went for a walk. I had to think.

01:15:06.684 --> 01:15:10.812
Caden, what are you doing at night?

01:15:11.564 --> 01:15:14.065
I have a right to fucking know.

01:15:14.775 --> 01:15:17.277
I've been going to Adele's place.

01:15:18.779 --> 01:15:21.030
And cleaning it.

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:27.203
Do you have any idea
what I've given up for you? For this?

01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:30.039
For you? For you?
Could you please get that?

01:15:38.924 --> 01:15:42.135
- This looks serious. Am I interrupting?
- What's going on, Hazel?

01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:46.222
I just wanted you to know
that the actress playing me...

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.974
...is ready to start today.

01:15:48.142 --> 01:15:51.311
That's great. That's all we need
around here, is two Hazels.

01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.980
Okay, I'll take that as my cue.

01:15:55.649 --> 01:15:57.984
- Maybe you could clean her toilet.
- Maybe I will.

01:16:00.738 --> 01:16:01.988
This is over.

01:16:02.823 --> 01:16:05.408
- No, Claire...
- I'm not talking to you.

01:16:05.576 --> 01:16:08.661
I didn't say I was gonna
clean Hazel's toilet. He did.

01:16:08.829 --> 01:16:11.581
- But you thought it!
- I thought it, but I didn't say it.

01:16:11.749 --> 01:16:15.668
I got an offer to do
Needleman in a Haystack.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.422
And I'm gonna take it.
I want you out of the apartment.

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:22.342
The real one. You can keep this one.

01:16:22.509 --> 01:16:24.010
Claire.

01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:27.138
Jesus. Claire.

01:16:28.223 --> 01:16:30.892
Hi, yeah, we're gonna need
a Claire replacement.

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.479
Claire, I didn't say it.

01:16:39.944 --> 01:16:42.195
I already put out a call
for a Claire replacement.

01:16:44.782 --> 01:16:46.950
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

01:16:47.117 --> 01:16:50.161
Just like that?
You don't give a guy even a chance?

01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:54.874
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl, remember?

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:57.710
I try and be fun-loving, see?

01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:59.671
Sorry.

01:16:59.838 --> 01:17:01.631
My analyst says
you have complexes.

01:17:01.799 --> 01:17:04.217
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

01:17:04.385 --> 01:17:07.512
- That's before my analyst taught me...
- This is the last of my stuff.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.847
- Bye.
- Bye. From the top?

01:17:10.015 --> 01:17:12.350
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

01:17:12.518 --> 01:17:15.061
But I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to move on.

01:17:25.531 --> 01:17:27.907
I'm sorry. Okay.

01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:42.922
Oh, Needleman,
you had such potential.

01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:45.842
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to move on.

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:48.177
Just like that?
You don't give a guy a chance?

01:17:48.345 --> 01:17:51.723
I'm not a chance-giving girl.
I'm a fun-loving girl.

01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.267
Once you enjoyed
Needleman's complexes.

01:17:54.435 --> 01:17:56.310
That's before my analyst taught me...

01:17:56.478 --> 01:17:57.729
This is a lie.

01:17:57.896 --> 01:18:01.065
Come here.
I try to be fun-loving, see?

01:18:01.233 --> 01:18:03.735
- She told me your hatred of...
- Will.

01:18:03.902 --> 01:18:06.904
Wall it up. All of it.

01:18:15.789 --> 01:18:17.373
Claire.

01:18:22.963 --> 01:18:24.630
Oh, Needleman.

01:18:25.299 --> 01:18:27.133
All right.

01:18:30.929 --> 01:18:32.889
Good for you with your grant.

01:18:33.057 --> 01:18:36.142
Listen, I fixed up the walk-in
as a sort of bedroom if you want.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:37.435
We'd love to have you...

01:18:37.603 --> 01:18:40.396
...and you wouldn't have to schlep
all the way to Queens.

01:18:41.106 --> 01:18:44.692
It's just a thought. Kisses, A.

01:18:53.744 --> 01:18:56.788
Dear diary, I'm afraid I'm gravely ill.

01:18:58.332 --> 01:19:02.293
It is perhaps times like these
that one reflects on things past.

01:19:02.711 --> 01:19:05.004
An article of clothing
from when I was young.

01:19:05.172 --> 01:19:07.632
A green jacket.
A walk with my father.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.676
A game we once played.
Pretend we're fairies.

01:19:10.844 --> 01:19:13.429
I'm a girl fairy,
and my name is Lauralee...

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:16.933
...and you're a boy fairy,
and your name is Teetery.

01:19:17.101 --> 01:19:19.310
Pretend when we're fairies,
we fight each other.

01:19:19.478 --> 01:19:23.940
And I say, "Stop hitting me or I'll die. "
And you hit me again, and I say:

01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:27.819
"Now I have to die. "
And you say, "But I'll miss you. "

01:19:27.986 --> 01:19:30.530
And I say, "But I have to.

01:19:30.697 --> 01:19:34.033
And you'll have to wait a million years
to see me again.

01:19:34.201 --> 01:19:35.660
And I'll be put in a box...

01:19:35.828 --> 01:19:38.704
...and all I'll need
is a tiny glass of water...

01:19:38.872 --> 01:19:40.832
...and lots of tiny pieces of pizza.

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:43.626
And the box will have wings
like an airplane. "

01:19:43.794 --> 01:19:46.629
And you ask,
"Where will it take you?"

01:19:46.797 --> 01:19:49.841
"Home," I say.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.442
This is to hear.

01:20:08.986 --> 01:20:13.865
- So words... English here, yeah?
- Okay.

01:20:20.164 --> 01:20:21.914
I'm dying...

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.667
...as I'm sure Maria told you.

01:20:28.589 --> 01:20:32.466
The flower tattoos have become
infected and they're dying.

01:20:33.385 --> 01:20:37.305
So I am as well. This is life.

01:20:38.015 --> 01:20:40.766
It's Maria. She did this.

01:20:42.019 --> 01:20:44.645
Maria gave me a reason to live
once you left.

01:20:45.731 --> 01:20:46.772
The flowers defined me.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.192
Your mother and Maria
took you away.

01:20:49.359 --> 01:20:52.528
I've tried for years to find you.
I didn't leave you.

01:20:53.363 --> 01:20:56.324
I want to talk to you
about your homosexuality.

01:20:56.742 --> 01:20:59.952
- I'm not a homosexual.
- Maria said you would deny it.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.456
Well, she's a liar. She's lying to you.

01:21:03.624 --> 01:21:08.169
I had the same struggle
when I first fell in love with Maria...

01:21:08.337 --> 01:21:10.796
...and we began to have dirty,
aching sex.

01:21:10.964 --> 01:21:13.216
Maria is your lover?

01:21:13.383 --> 01:21:16.844
Of course.
She introduced me to myself...

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:19.305
...to my vagina and to hers.

01:21:19.473 --> 01:21:22.808
You have no idea how evil she is.

01:21:22.976 --> 01:21:25.478
I need to forgive you before I die...

01:21:25.646 --> 01:21:29.315
...but I can't forgive someone
who has not asked for forgiveness.

01:21:29.983 --> 01:21:33.069
- I just want...
- I have no time.

01:21:33.362 --> 01:21:36.906
I need you to ask for forgiveness.

01:21:38.659 --> 01:21:41.160
Can you ever forgive me?

01:21:42.412 --> 01:21:44.497
- For what?
- For abandoning you.

01:21:44.665 --> 01:21:49.669
For abandoning you
to have anal sex...

01:21:49.836 --> 01:21:52.755
...with my homosexual lover, Eric.

01:21:55.467 --> 01:21:57.843
I will, I'll say it.

01:21:59.805 --> 01:22:02.139
For abandoning you...

01:22:03.684 --> 01:22:09.146
...to have anal sex
with my homosexual lover, Eric.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.817
No.

01:22:18.532 --> 01:22:20.658
No, I'm sorry.

01:22:27.457 --> 01:22:29.125
I cannot.

01:22:46.435 --> 01:22:49.979
I hope you are happy, faggot.

01:22:50.147 --> 01:22:54.150
I'm not happy. I'm not happy.

01:23:42.407 --> 01:23:45.951
I've talked to you before. This is not
a play about dating. It's about death.

01:23:46.119 --> 01:23:48.287
Make it personal. Move along.

01:23:49.623 --> 01:23:51.957
He doesn't need to yell at them.

01:23:55.295 --> 01:23:59.840
It is a play about dating.
It's not a play just about death.

01:24:00.008 --> 01:24:02.009
It's about everything.

01:24:02.386 --> 01:24:06.639
Dating, birth, death, life, family...

01:24:06.807 --> 01:24:08.391
...all that.

01:24:09.017 --> 01:24:10.768
- This doesn't look real.
- What?

01:24:10.936 --> 01:24:13.396
- It's not real.
- I can't hear you.

01:24:44.261 --> 01:24:49.181
- Morning, Haze.
- Hi, Caden. How was your night?

01:24:49.349 --> 01:24:51.267
It was okay. Yours?

01:24:52.185 --> 01:24:54.520
Phillip was colicky.
I was up all night.

01:24:55.772 --> 01:24:57.440
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

01:24:57.607 --> 01:25:00.192
- Everybody here?
- Sammy's not here.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.363
Jimmy called and said
there's some subway problem.

01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:07.032
Sorry. Sorry.

01:25:07.242 --> 01:25:10.077
- Hi, Hazel.
- Hi, Sammy.

01:25:14.416 --> 01:25:16.542
Sammy likes you.

01:25:27.471 --> 01:25:30.514
I need you to build this.
This is just the façade.

01:25:30.682 --> 01:25:32.766
It's Adele's place.
We'll be casting an Ellen.

01:25:32.934 --> 01:25:35.728
I can give you the interiors later.

01:25:38.148 --> 01:25:40.065
A few days?

01:25:43.904 --> 01:25:47.740
- Can I look again?
- A slight shift in perspective on this.

01:25:50.452 --> 01:25:53.329
Millicent Weems?

01:26:00.587 --> 01:26:05.174
- Caden, this is...
- Hazel, what do you think of this title?

01:26:06.134 --> 01:26:09.428
Unknown, Unkissed and Lost?

01:26:14.476 --> 01:26:17.978
Anyway, this is Millicent Weems.

01:26:18.146 --> 01:26:19.230
Have a seat.

01:26:21.775 --> 01:26:23.901
How are you at cleaning?

01:26:25.362 --> 01:26:27.947
- Very, very good at it.
- This part requires a lot of it.

01:26:28.114 --> 01:26:30.699
You'd be playing a cleaning lady.

01:26:31.368 --> 01:26:35.621
I played Egga, the cleaning lady,
in Hedda Gabler at the Roundabout.

01:26:35.789 --> 01:26:38.040
Great. Okay.

01:26:39.459 --> 01:26:42.878
And Mrs. Dobson in Scrub-A-Dub
at the Pantages.

01:26:44.673 --> 01:26:47.925
You're weirdly close
to what I visualize for this character.

01:26:51.346 --> 01:26:53.973
Glad to be weirdly close.

01:27:00.063 --> 01:27:02.481
Sorry, everybody.

01:27:03.817 --> 01:27:06.151
- Maurice, what's going on?
- I'm sorry.

01:27:06.319 --> 01:27:09.280
We have a couple of new guys on.
We're not in sync yet.

01:27:09.447 --> 01:27:11.907
- We good to go?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:14.911 --> 01:27:16.537
I'm sorry.

01:27:17.706 --> 01:27:18.747
Fuck.

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:24.169
Are you Ellen?
Are you Ellen Bascomb?

01:27:24.337 --> 01:27:25.838
Shit.

01:27:26.631 --> 01:27:27.673
Line, please?

01:27:29.634 --> 01:27:31.844
Ellen... "What?"

01:27:32.012 --> 01:27:34.138
Right, right. What?

01:27:34.306 --> 01:27:38.767
I'm to give the key to 31Y
to Ellen Bascomb.

01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:40.811
Yes, I'm Ellen.

01:27:44.357 --> 01:27:47.109
Oh, dear. It's the wrong key.

01:27:47.277 --> 01:27:48.694
I'll be in, in a second.

01:27:48.862 --> 01:27:50.529
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:27:52.616 --> 01:27:55.618
- You're breaking the fourth wall.
- This is the wrong key.

01:27:55.785 --> 01:27:57.870
- I'm supposed to open the door.
- Hold on.

01:27:59.539 --> 01:28:02.291
- Are you in there?
- There's no one in there.

01:28:03.084 --> 01:28:04.543
- Adele?
- Caden.

01:28:04.711 --> 01:28:07.004
I don't think it's... It's not quite...

01:28:07.172 --> 01:28:10.466
I'm jumping in the shower.
I'll be out in a second.

01:28:12.177 --> 01:28:15.054
Do you want some coffee?
I can make a fresh pot.

01:28:15.597 --> 01:28:20.184
Did you look at the new painting
on my easel? What do you think?

01:28:20.518 --> 01:28:22.853
Hey, thanks for the fuck
this morning.

01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:26.607
- People don't walk like that.
- What? Is it too?

01:28:26.775 --> 01:28:29.234
No, just walk like yourself.

01:28:29.861 --> 01:28:31.945
Watch. Watch this.

01:28:33.657 --> 01:28:35.574
I gotta go.

01:28:36.326 --> 01:28:38.035
Watch this.

01:28:56.096 --> 01:28:59.390
Where's Hazel and Sammy?

01:29:06.439 --> 01:29:08.023
Sammy.

01:29:08.441 --> 01:29:12.111
Sammy. Sammy.

01:29:12.278 --> 01:29:14.196
- Hi, Caden.
- What are you doing?

01:29:16.074 --> 01:29:18.117
I was being you.

01:29:19.119 --> 01:29:20.911
You know, you like Hazel,
I like Hazel.

01:29:21.079 --> 01:29:24.623
This Hazel doesn't exist for you. If you
wanna like a Hazel, like that one.

01:29:24.791 --> 01:29:26.250
That's what I tried to tell him.

01:29:26.418 --> 01:29:29.044
No harm, no foul, Caden.
It's equity break anyway.

01:29:29.212 --> 01:29:31.422
Ten minutes, everybody!

01:29:32.924 --> 01:29:34.216
- Hazel.
- What?

01:29:34.968 --> 01:29:38.595
- You don't like him, do you?
- Yeah, he reminds me of you.

01:29:40.306 --> 01:29:43.517
I'm me. You don't need someone
to remind you of me.

01:29:43.685 --> 01:29:46.895
Oh, don't worry, Caden.
I like you more.

01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:50.315
I do. It's just, Sammy's fun.

01:29:50.734 --> 01:29:54.820
- I'm fun.
- Oh, sweetie, no, you're not.

01:29:54.988 --> 01:29:56.655
Hold on a sec. Yes?

01:29:56.823 --> 01:29:58.615
- Is this Caden cotard?
- Yes.

01:29:58.783 --> 01:30:01.076
This is Officer Melnin
of Schenectady P.D.

01:30:01.244 --> 01:30:04.663
I'm sorry to inform you your mother's
been the victim of a home invasion.

01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:07.666
- What does that mean?
- She is dead.

01:30:15.717 --> 01:30:18.594
Was my father standing with us?

01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:21.889
I don't know what he looks like.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.391
He's dead.

01:30:24.851 --> 01:30:29.313
- So he looks dead, I guess.
- Probably wasn't him, then.

01:30:30.064 --> 01:30:32.065
He was a big guy.

01:30:35.695 --> 01:30:37.488
Anyway...

01:30:41.826 --> 01:30:43.202
Thanks for coming with me.

01:30:45.622 --> 01:30:47.372
That's okay.

01:30:49.042 --> 01:30:50.375
I asked Hazel...

01:30:50.543 --> 01:30:53.921
...but she was busy tonight,
and you're the next best thing.

01:30:54.297 --> 01:30:59.510
I mean, it's not
that you're the next best thing...

01:30:59.677 --> 01:31:03.096
...but because you play her,
it feels comforting.

01:31:04.474 --> 01:31:06.391
Does that make sense?

01:31:09.312 --> 01:31:13.649
Although the thing is,
off-stage you're nothing like her.

01:31:13.858 --> 01:31:17.069
But you play her very well, though.

01:31:26.746 --> 01:31:29.331
Did Hazel mention
what she was doing tonight?

01:31:29.499 --> 01:31:31.500
Because I called her house
before we left...

01:31:31.668 --> 01:31:35.254
...and her husband told me
she wasn't gonna be back till late.

01:31:35.421 --> 01:31:40.217
And I just thought that was weird
because she said Phillip was sick.

01:31:40.927 --> 01:31:42.928
She's having dinner with Sammy.

01:31:43.096 --> 01:31:45.514
- That's interesting.
- He's supposed to like me.

01:31:45.682 --> 01:31:47.975
I'll have another talk with him.

01:31:52.689 --> 01:31:56.191
Will you excuse me?
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:31:59.696 --> 01:32:01.947
Don't forget your phone.

01:32:04.117 --> 01:32:06.118
Thanks, Yammy.

01:32:11.291 --> 01:32:15.085
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.597
You can stay in my parents' room.

01:32:34.063 --> 01:32:36.565
I thought someone
would have cleaned it up.

01:32:37.483 --> 01:32:39.151
Who?

01:32:39.986 --> 01:32:41.653
I don't know. Someone.

01:32:45.992 --> 01:32:49.536
This is my room.
You can sleep here.

01:32:49.704 --> 01:32:51.830
Where are you going to sleep?

01:32:53.041 --> 01:32:57.085
- The living-room couch.
- Don't you want to sleep with me?

01:32:59.297 --> 01:33:02.674
- It's just sex.
- Okay.

01:33:03.009 --> 01:33:05.010
If you think it's okay.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.017
- How can you be like that?
- I get undressed every day.

01:33:12.352 --> 01:33:15.187
In front of someone is different.

01:33:16.105 --> 01:33:17.940
I don't see why.

01:33:18.107 --> 01:33:20.108
Maybe because
you have a beautiful body.

01:33:20.276 --> 01:33:24.029
- Maybe that makes it easier.
- Yeah, I suppose it might.

01:33:25.156 --> 01:33:27.240
Do you want to fuck?

01:33:27.533 --> 01:33:30.535
I do. Do you?

01:33:31.204 --> 01:33:33.956
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm sorry.

01:33:34.374 --> 01:33:37.960
I'm very, very lonely.

01:33:39.921 --> 01:33:42.005
I don't...

01:33:43.299 --> 01:33:46.176
...know what's wrong. I just...

01:33:48.346 --> 01:33:50.097
I'm sorry.

01:33:52.934 --> 01:33:55.143
Do you understand?

01:33:55.311 --> 01:33:59.064
I mean,
can you understand loneliness?

01:34:00.733 --> 01:34:03.568
Yeah. I mean...

01:34:04.404 --> 01:34:08.615
I don't know, I feel okay, mostly.

01:34:10.076 --> 01:34:12.285
Fucking might help.

01:34:14.872 --> 01:34:16.498
I'm sorry.

01:34:16.916 --> 01:34:21.253
It's okay, I don't mind.
Take your clothes off.

01:34:22.547 --> 01:34:25.966
- You're very pretty.
- Thanks.

01:34:26.134 --> 01:34:30.804
Sometimes I wish
I could be pretty like that.

01:34:31.431 --> 01:34:33.056
What, you wish you were a girl?

01:34:33.224 --> 01:34:35.517
Sometimes I think
I might have been better at it.

01:34:35.685 --> 01:34:40.272
Interesting.
It's kind of a drag in a lot of ways.

01:34:41.607 --> 01:34:45.777
- Do you like guys?
- No. I only love women.

01:34:45.945 --> 01:34:49.114
Well, I'm getting cold.

01:35:00.752 --> 01:35:02.961
You're pretty, Caden.

01:35:05.298 --> 01:35:08.550
Thanks for saying that.

01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:13.096
Come to bed, pretty Caden.

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:21.188
I shouldn't have drunk
so much fucking beer last night.

01:35:24.817 --> 01:35:28.028
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Get lunch. What are you going to do?

01:35:28.196 --> 01:35:29.821
- For chrissake.
- Good, Roland.

01:35:29.989 --> 01:35:31.364
Thanks, Caden.

01:35:31.532 --> 01:35:33.742
We need to fire him.

01:35:35.828 --> 01:35:37.579
We don't need to fire him.

01:35:38.998 --> 01:35:40.707
Jeremy's playing to us.

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:43.418
Tell him to talk to Donna
and we'll hear what we hear.

01:35:43.586 --> 01:35:46.671
Sammy's explaining too much.
It feels expository.

01:35:46.839 --> 01:35:49.925
It needs to be shorthand, like,
"Jeremy, big. "

01:35:51.094 --> 01:35:53.553
Caden, can we stop a second?

01:35:54.013 --> 01:35:55.597
Sure.

01:35:55.848 --> 01:35:59.142
If Hazel's in love with Sammy,
and Caden's in love with Hazel...

01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:02.604
...there would be a big confrontation
where Caden turns to me and says:

01:36:02.772 --> 01:36:05.190
"It's obvious he's a substitute
for me. "

01:36:05.358 --> 01:36:08.318
Then I think Hazel would have
a good moment where she cries...

01:36:08.486 --> 01:36:13.198
...or gets angry, I'm not sure which yet,
but I think it's dramatically sound...

01:36:13.366 --> 01:36:15.951
- That didn't happen.
- I think Hazel would do that.

01:36:16.119 --> 01:36:20.205
- But Hazel hasn't done that, Tammy.
- Caden, what do you think?

01:36:26.379 --> 01:36:29.506
I feel like we could try it.

01:36:30.424 --> 01:36:32.467
- Great.
- Fuck.

01:36:37.765 --> 01:36:43.353
Let's try it. Maybe it could happen
at the director's table.

01:36:47.525 --> 01:36:49.401
Fuck.

01:36:51.737 --> 01:36:52.821
You know, Tammy's right.

01:36:52.989 --> 01:36:55.490
I don't understand
why you're with Sammy.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.203
He's nice, he's available,
he fucks me without crying.

01:37:00.371 --> 01:37:02.372
Since when are you available?

01:37:03.457 --> 01:37:07.169
Derek left because of you.

01:37:09.505 --> 01:37:12.465
When?
How come you never told me?

01:37:12.633 --> 01:37:15.969
I don't know, Caden.
How come a lot of things, huh?

01:37:16.429 --> 01:37:20.432
Fuck. I gotta let go of the actor
who played Derek. What's his name?

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.436
What?
That is such a romantic response.

01:37:24.604 --> 01:37:26.313
- I am touched.
- It's not my response.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.606
Derek is played by...

01:37:27.773 --> 01:37:31.109
We have enormous
budgetary concerns here.

01:37:33.779 --> 01:37:36.740
...Joe.
- Stop. Okay? No, just stop.

01:37:36.908 --> 01:37:41.161
I do not like Tammy,
and she's nothing like me.

01:37:41.412 --> 01:37:43.747
- How can you like her, anyway?
- She looks like you.

01:37:43.915 --> 01:37:47.042
- Joe Abernathy. No, she does not.
- She offered to have sex with me.

01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:49.502
- Abernathy?
- Yeah.

01:37:50.296 --> 01:37:52.297
- Was it good?
- It was nice.

01:37:52.465 --> 01:37:56.301
I'm just being honest. It was nice.
It wasn't earth-shattering.

01:37:58.804 --> 01:38:00.305
- Did you cry?
- No.

01:38:00.973 --> 01:38:03.183
You're making progress.

01:38:04.518 --> 01:38:07.562
Okay, I cried a little before.

01:38:15.154 --> 01:38:18.740
Hazel, you've been a part of me
forever. Don't you know that?

01:38:22.662 --> 01:38:25.830
I breathe your name
in every exhalation.

01:38:29.794 --> 01:38:32.921
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

01:38:52.942 --> 01:38:57.445
Oh, this is the place
I stayed with Derek and the kids.

01:38:57.613 --> 01:39:00.115
- Yeah, we're almost...
- Caden.

01:39:01.826 --> 01:39:03.493
Caden.

01:39:03.911 --> 01:39:07.122
- Caden. Caden, look at me.
- What are you doing?

01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:09.416
Sammy, stay right where you are.
I'm coming up.

01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:12.377
There's nothing to talk about, Hazel.
It's not your fault.

01:39:12.545 --> 01:39:15.380
- What are you doing?
- I've watched you forever, Caden.

01:39:15.548 --> 01:39:18.842
But you've never really looked
at anyone other than yourself.

01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:20.385
So watch me.

01:39:21.637 --> 01:39:25.056
Watch my heart break.
Watch me jump.

01:39:26.559 --> 01:39:28.768
Watch me learn
that after death there's nothing.

01:39:28.936 --> 01:39:31.521
No more watching,
no more following, no love.

01:39:31.689 --> 01:39:36.693
Say goodbye to Hazel for me.
And say it for yourself too.

01:39:37.069 --> 01:39:40.030
- None of us has much time.
- Sammy! Come down!

01:39:40.197 --> 01:39:44.242
Hazel, I love you!

01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:46.161
Sammy!

01:39:46.412 --> 01:39:49.080
I didn't jump, Sammy.

01:39:49.707 --> 01:39:52.375
A man stopped me before I jumped.
Get up!

01:39:54.879 --> 01:39:56.588
I didn't jump.

01:40:03.012 --> 01:40:05.513
I know how to do it now.

01:40:05.848 --> 01:40:09.059
There are nearly 13 million people
in the world.

01:40:09.226 --> 01:40:11.102
I mean, can you imagine
that many people?

01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:14.439
And none of those people
is an extra.

01:40:15.274 --> 01:40:21.363
They're all leads in their own stories.
They have to be given their due.

01:40:21.947 --> 01:40:23.448
I know how to do it now.

01:40:23.616 --> 01:40:25.784
There are 13 million people
in this world.

01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:28.661
Can you imagine
how many people that is?

01:40:28.829 --> 01:40:32.874
None of those people are an extra.
They're all a lead in their own story.

01:40:33.042 --> 01:40:35.168
They have got to be given their due.

01:40:35.336 --> 01:40:37.712
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:40:38.422 --> 01:40:40.423
Come over tonight.

01:40:43.469 --> 01:40:45.470
Please.

01:40:46.931 --> 01:40:48.932
You know,
we could get a place together.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:53.812
- We could get a loft.
- God, Caden, that sounds nice.

01:40:53.979 --> 01:40:56.481
I miss my daughter.
Maybe she could come live with us.

01:40:56.649 --> 01:40:58.775
I miss Olive.

01:40:59.402 --> 01:41:00.985
And the other one.

01:41:01.612 --> 01:41:04.114
- I'm a bad person.
- Oh, no, you're not.

01:41:04.281 --> 01:41:07.992
I am. I should never have gone out
with Sammy.

01:41:08.369 --> 01:41:10.703
I was just trying to get to you.

01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:13.498
You can't cause someone
to kill himself.

01:41:14.458 --> 01:41:16.751
He was very troubled.

01:41:17.044 --> 01:41:19.003
God, Caden.

01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:24.884
I wish we had this
when we were young.

01:41:27.847 --> 01:41:30.014
And all those years in between.

01:41:30.182 --> 01:41:32.684
My heart aches so much for you.

01:41:32.852 --> 01:41:35.353
We're here, Caden.

01:41:36.188 --> 01:41:40.942
- I'm here.
- I'm aching for it being over.

01:41:42.528 --> 01:41:47.031
Yeah. The end is built
into the beginning.

01:41:47.783 --> 01:41:49.868
What can you do?

01:41:50.035 --> 01:41:53.872
- God, you're just perfect.
- I'm a mess.

01:41:54.498 --> 01:41:58.209
- But we fit, don't we?
- Yeah.

01:42:08.637 --> 01:42:10.555
It doesn't always happen
for me now...

01:42:10.723 --> 01:42:13.516
...because of the medication
and everything.

01:42:13.684 --> 01:42:17.437
- I take a lot of pills.
- It's okay.

01:42:18.564 --> 01:42:23.193
I'm embarrassed. I don't want you
to think it's about you or me.

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:25.111
It's okay.

01:43:09.698 --> 01:43:11.783
I have a title.

01:43:13.619 --> 01:43:19.249
The Obscure Moon
Lighting an Obscure World.

01:43:22.795 --> 01:43:25.964
I think it might be too much.

01:43:27.383 --> 01:43:29.842
Yeah, probably.

01:43:41.939 --> 01:43:44.566
Sir, could you come up here,
please?

01:44:02.626 --> 01:44:05.128
Might be smoke inhalation.

01:44:10.467 --> 01:44:13.553
It's Hazel. Leave a message or not.
It's your dime.

01:44:13.721 --> 01:44:16.556
I know how to do the play now.

01:44:19.518 --> 01:44:23.104
It'll all take place
over the course of one day...

01:44:24.356 --> 01:44:27.692
...and that day
will be the day before you died.

01:44:29.111 --> 01:44:32.071
It was the happiest day of my life.

01:44:34.867 --> 01:44:37.827
And I'll be able to relive it forever.

01:44:38.245 --> 01:44:40.204
See you soon.

01:44:45.044 --> 01:44:50.340
So have you got any thoughts
for today's rehearsal?

01:44:51.425 --> 01:44:53.635
I have a new title, maybe.

01:44:53.802 --> 01:44:56.804
Infectious Diseases in Cattle.

01:45:00.684 --> 01:45:04.854
The title means a lot of things.
You'll see, it means a lot.

01:45:16.325 --> 01:45:18.910
I need a Caden for my Hazel.

01:45:19.912 --> 01:45:22.038
I'd very much like to play Caden.

01:45:23.749 --> 01:45:26.376
I know that...

01:45:26.752 --> 01:45:30.213
I know that it would be
nontraditional casting...

01:45:30.881 --> 01:45:34.634
...but I think I could do it.
I think I understand him.

01:45:34.802 --> 01:45:36.427
I don't understand him.

01:45:36.595 --> 01:45:43.101
Well, Caden Cotard
is a man already dead.

01:45:43.268 --> 01:45:50.108
He lives in a half world
between stasis and antistasis...

01:45:50.275 --> 01:45:53.986
...and time is concentrated,
chronology confused.

01:45:54.154 --> 01:46:00.284
Yet up until recently,
he's strived valiantly...

01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:04.580
...to make sense of his situation.

01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:08.209
But now he's turned to stone.

01:46:09.169 --> 01:46:12.964
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

01:46:14.466 --> 01:46:16.634
- Thanks.
- She's right?

01:46:16.802 --> 01:46:20.722
I didn't see that at all.
I saw it as much more hopeful.

01:46:22.307 --> 01:46:25.518
None of those people is extras.

01:46:25.686 --> 01:46:28.146
They're all leads in their own stories.

01:46:32.151 --> 01:46:35.820
No, this is tedious. This is nothing.

01:46:39.992 --> 01:46:42.744
Hi, your scene's over.
Would you leave the stage?

01:46:42.911 --> 01:46:45.788
- What is she doing?
- He's directing.

01:46:45.956 --> 01:46:48.791
Can I get you down
at the coffin there?

01:46:48.959 --> 01:46:51.627
She not getting the feel of you,
Caden.

01:46:51.795 --> 01:46:55.506
You don't move around like that.
You don't talk to people.

01:46:59.052 --> 01:47:02.764
Sit on the ground there.
Okay, everybody, let's run it.

01:47:04.725 --> 01:47:07.685
Everything is more complicated
than you think.

01:47:07.853 --> 01:47:10.605
You only see a tenth of what is true.

01:47:10.773 --> 01:47:15.985
There are a million little strings
attached to every choice you make.

01:47:16.153 --> 01:47:18.780
You can destroy your life
every time you choose.

01:47:18.947 --> 01:47:22.366
But maybe you won't know
for 20 years...

01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:25.203
...and you may never, ever trace it
to its source.

01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:27.872
And you only get one chance
to play it out.

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:30.875
Just try and figure out
your own divorce.

01:47:31.585 --> 01:47:36.839
And they say there is no fate,
but there is, it's what you create.

01:47:37.549 --> 01:47:40.259
And even though the world goes on
for eons and eons...

01:47:40.427 --> 01:47:44.972
...you are only here for a fraction
of a fraction of a second.

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.351
Most of your time is spent being dead
or not yet born.

01:47:48.519 --> 01:47:51.979
But while alive, you wait in vain...

01:47:52.147 --> 01:47:56.067
...wasting years for a phone call
or a letter or a look...

01:47:56.235 --> 01:47:58.569
...from someone or something
to make it all right.

01:47:58.737 --> 01:48:03.199
And it never comes, or it seems to,
but it doesn't really.

01:48:03.826 --> 01:48:06.202
So you spend your time
in vague regret...

01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:10.039
...or vaguer hope
that something good will come along.

01:48:10.207 --> 01:48:11.916
Something
to make you feel connected.

01:48:12.084 --> 01:48:14.418
Something
to make you feel whole.

01:48:14.586 --> 01:48:17.588
Something
to make you feel loved.

01:48:18.799 --> 01:48:20.675
And the truth is...

01:48:21.844 --> 01:48:24.220
...I feel so angry.

01:48:25.389 --> 01:48:27.265
And the truth is...

01:48:27.975 --> 01:48:31.269
...I feel so fucking sad.

01:48:32.437 --> 01:48:38.192
And the truth is, I've felt
so fucking hurt for so fucking long.

01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:41.195
And for just as long,
I've been pretending I'm okay...

01:48:41.363 --> 01:48:44.824
...just to get along, just for...

01:48:45.951 --> 01:48:47.577
I don't know why.

01:48:47.744 --> 01:48:52.540
Maybe because no one wants to hear
about my misery...

01:48:53.125 --> 01:48:55.459
...because they have their own.

01:48:58.964 --> 01:49:00.631
Well, fuck everybody.

01:49:03.302 --> 01:49:05.136
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:49:21.778 --> 01:49:23.821
- Delightful.
- Thanks.

01:49:23.989 --> 01:49:25.114
I'm out of ideas.

01:49:29.036 --> 01:49:30.953
I'm dead.

01:49:32.331 --> 01:49:38.085
Well, I could take over as you for a bit
until you feel refreshed.

01:49:38.253 --> 01:49:42.131
I think you're tired, Caden.
All these years of creative work.

01:49:42.674 --> 01:49:48.971
I think you just need some time
to regroup.

01:49:49.806 --> 01:49:53.351
- I need to keep my hand in.
- Well, Ellen needs to be filled.

01:49:53.518 --> 01:49:56.562
- What do you mean?
- Her role. Just for a bit.

01:49:56.730 --> 01:49:59.023
It's a choice role.

01:50:00.901 --> 01:50:03.235
I do like to clean.

01:50:17.834 --> 01:50:19.710
Ellen?

01:50:23.924 --> 01:50:27.885
- Yes?
- Caden asked me to give you this.

01:50:28.053 --> 01:50:31.180
You're to keep it in all the time.

01:50:35.769 --> 01:50:41.065
So touched by the sadness
of Adele's neighbor so close to death.

01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:44.568
Say, "Thank you,"
to Adele's neighbor.

01:50:45.153 --> 01:50:46.362
Thank you.

01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:49.031
You're very welcome, young lady.

01:50:49.199 --> 01:50:52.576
- Now say, "Have a very good day. "
- Have a very good day.

01:50:52.744 --> 01:50:55.079
I will indeed.

01:50:59.001 --> 01:51:01.585
Reach for the toilet paper.

01:51:02.295 --> 01:51:05.047
Wrap some around your hand.

01:51:05.424 --> 01:51:07.508
Wipe yourself.

01:51:12.597 --> 01:51:14.932
There was supposed to be
something else.

01:51:16.393 --> 01:51:20.938
You were supposed
to have something, a calm.

01:51:21.106 --> 01:51:22.982
Love.

01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:25.026
Children.

01:51:25.193 --> 01:51:28.112
A child, at least.

01:51:28.655 --> 01:51:30.781
Children.

01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:33.576
Meaning.

01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:43.377
Everything okay, Eric?

01:51:45.338 --> 01:51:49.050
- Everything is everything.
- He hates me.

01:51:51.053 --> 01:51:54.597
I disappointed him,
and he hates me.

01:51:56.016 --> 01:52:00.102
Everyone is disappointing
when you know someone.

01:52:04.983 --> 01:52:10.237
I remember having that picnic
with my mother. Look at me.

01:52:10.405 --> 01:52:12.198
Ellen, what is it?

01:52:12.365 --> 01:52:14.492
I was so young.

01:52:14.659 --> 01:52:17.828
I'm going to remember this moment
for the rest of my life, Mama...

01:52:18.246 --> 01:52:22.249
...and in exactly 20 years,
come here with my daughter...

01:52:22.417 --> 01:52:24.168
...and have exactly the same picnic.

01:52:24.336 --> 01:52:25.419
There was so much hope.

01:52:25.587 --> 01:52:28.839
Baby, that the loveliest thing
I've ever heard.

01:52:31.009 --> 01:52:36.472
Oh, God. Sorry, Mommy. I'm sorry.

01:52:55.867 --> 01:52:58.202
Where is my little girl?

01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:02.748
Where is my little girl?
Where is my little girl?

01:53:13.135 --> 01:53:16.345
Look at the night table
for a note from Adele.

01:53:24.312 --> 01:53:26.897
Stare out the window.

01:53:28.275 --> 01:53:32.027
Remember the time she got you
to pose for one of her paintings?

01:53:32.195 --> 01:53:34.780
How she told you
how beautiful you were?

01:53:34.948 --> 01:53:38.909
How she made you feel pretty again
for a little while?

01:53:39.077 --> 01:53:41.412
Think how you'll miss her.

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.956
Stand up.

01:53:52.424 --> 01:53:56.093
Now it is waiting, and nobody cares.

01:53:56.261 --> 01:54:00.431
And when your wait is over,
this room will still exist...

01:54:00.599 --> 01:54:05.144
...and it will continue to hold shoes
and dresses and boxes...

01:54:05.312 --> 01:54:08.522
...and maybe someday
another waiting person.

01:54:08.690 --> 01:54:10.608
And maybe not.

01:54:10.942 --> 01:54:13.485
The room doesn't care either.

01:54:29.878 --> 01:54:31.754
Hello?

01:54:51.942 --> 01:54:56.070
There's nobody running the elevator
anymore.

01:55:30.939 --> 01:55:35.109
What was once before you,
an exciting and mysterious future...

01:55:35.277 --> 01:55:40.364
...is now behind you,
lived, understood, disappointing.

01:55:40.865 --> 01:55:43.367
You realize you are not special.

01:55:43.535 --> 01:55:48.914
You have struggled into existence
and are now slipping silently out of it.

01:55:49.082 --> 01:55:53.168
This is everyone's experience.
Every single one.

01:55:53.336 --> 01:55:58.215
The specifics hardly matter.
Everyone is everyone.

01:55:58.383 --> 01:56:00.301
So you are Adele...

01:56:00.468 --> 01:56:04.930
...Hazel, claire, Olive.

01:56:05.890 --> 01:56:10.644
You are Ellen.
All her meager sadnesses are yours.

01:56:10.812 --> 01:56:15.357
All her loneliness.
The gray, straw-like hair.

01:56:15.525 --> 01:56:19.486
Her red, raw hands. It's yours.

01:56:19.654 --> 01:56:22.865
It is time for you to understand this.

01:56:33.585 --> 01:56:35.377
Walk.

01:56:41.718 --> 01:56:44.928
As the people who adore you
stop adoring you...

01:56:45.096 --> 01:56:48.098
...as they die, as they move on...

01:56:48.266 --> 01:56:52.770
...as you shed them, as you shed
your beauty, your youth...

01:56:52.937 --> 01:56:56.273
...as the world forgets you,
as you recognize your transience...

01:56:56.816 --> 01:57:00.819
...as you begin to lose
your characteristics one by one...

01:57:00.987 --> 01:57:03.197
...as you learn
there is no one watching you...

01:57:03.365 --> 01:57:07.326
...and there never was,
you think only about driving.

01:57:07.494 --> 01:57:11.622
Not coming from anyplace,
not arriving anyplace...

01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:15.667
...just driving, counting off time.

01:57:15.835 --> 01:57:19.296
Now you are here. It's 7:43.

01:57:19.464 --> 01:57:22.424
Now you are here. It's 7:44.

01:57:22.592 --> 01:57:25.928
Now you are gone.

01:57:32.852 --> 01:57:34.978
Where is everybody?

01:57:36.189 --> 01:57:41.318
Mostly dead. Some have left.

01:57:47.575 --> 01:57:53.914
Would you sit with me for a moment?
Because I'm very tired and lonely.

01:58:13.852 --> 01:58:16.019
I feel like I know you.

01:58:16.563 --> 01:58:21.108
Well, I was the mother
in Ellen's dream.

01:58:21.276 --> 01:58:22.776
Yes.

01:58:25.738 --> 01:58:28.532
You seem a bit older
than I remember.

01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:31.034
That dream was quite a while ago.

01:58:31.953 --> 01:58:34.121
Apologize.

01:58:34.289 --> 01:58:36.123
I didn't mean to say you looked old.

01:58:46.676 --> 01:58:49.470
There's everyone's dreams
in all those apartments.

01:58:52.932 --> 01:58:58.020
All those thoughts I'll never know.
That's the truth of it.

01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:07.237
I wanted to do that picnic
with my daughter.

01:59:11.034 --> 01:59:13.327
I feel like
I've disappointed you terribly.

01:59:13.495 --> 01:59:17.706
Oh, no. I am so proud of you.

01:59:18.708 --> 01:59:21.251
Ask her if you can put your head
on her shoulder.

01:59:21.419 --> 01:59:24.588
Can I lay my head
on your shoulder?

01:59:24.839 --> 01:59:26.381
Yes.

01:59:35.808 --> 01:59:37.809
I love you.

01:59:41.064 --> 01:59:43.106
I love you too.

02:00:05.296 --> 02:00:08.298
I know how to do this play now.

02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:12.636
I have an idea.

02:00:13.137 --> 02:00:15.681
I think if everyone...

02:00:15.848 --> 02:00:18.348
Die.
