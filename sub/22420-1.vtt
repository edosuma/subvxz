00:31.331 --> 00:34.233
All right,
We are leaving the flatlands

00:34.235 --> 00:37.687
and we are heading up
towards the mountain top,

00:37.787 --> 00:40.422
which I'll show you right here.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.128
Way up there.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.764
I'm not sure who I'm meeting.

00:47.864 --> 00:49.632
The ad said $1,000 for the day.

00:49.732 --> 00:52.168
Filming services.

00:52.268 --> 00:56.522
Discretion is appreciated,
whatever that means.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.013
So, here's a thought:

01:03.113 --> 01:05.615
What if this is just some 40-something...

01:05.715 --> 01:09.455
...  who's sitting alone in her apartment...

01:09.486 --> 01:15.358
...  waiting for some young
handsome boy to come up the hill...

01:15.458 --> 01:20.597
... and give rubdowns, money,

01:20.697 --> 01:25.201
and whisper sweet nothings?

01:25.301 --> 01:27.301
It's just a thought.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.392
Cute little lake.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.596
Cute little town.

01:53.613 --> 02:00.670
This is promising.

02:00.770 --> 02:02.770
This is it.

02:02.805 --> 02:04.805
A yellow door.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.855
Okay.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.481
Okay.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.450
No answer and no voicemail,

02:47.550 --> 02:49.550
so that's good.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.251
Hmm.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.707
Okay, so...

03:10.807 --> 03:14.802
...  I think it's smarter if I wait in the car.

03:18.631 --> 03:21.366
You know, just--...

03:24.738 --> 03:28.393
...    I don't think this guy's showing up.

03:28.424 --> 03:29.325
Which is too--...

03:29.425 --> 03:30.827
...      - Hi.

03:30.927 --> 03:32.529
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.730
- Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.331
- I'm assuming you're Aaron?

03:35.431 --> 03:36.366
- Yeah.
I'm Aaron.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.201
Nice to meet you.
- Josef.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.301
Oh, my God.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.820
Oh, my God.

03:42.839 --> 03:46.176
This is gonna be a good day.
- Yeah.

03:46.276 --> 03:51.381
- You have a really nice,
kind face.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.949
- Thank you.
- All right.

03:53.049 --> 03:58.254
Come on.
- Okay.

03:58.354 --> 04:00.490
- I feel like we should just
do this right now...

04:00.590 --> 04:01.858
...because at the end of the day...

04:01.958 --> 04:03.626
...  it's gonna be normal,
so let me just.

04:03.726 --> 04:05.726
- Oh. Okay.

04:05.795 --> 04:10.300
- Trust me, that's not gonna
be anything weird at all.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.589
Never get used to those stairs.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.577
All right.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.413
So, welcome.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.450
This is our family vacation home.

04:27.550 --> 04:29.385
A lot of special memories.

04:29.485 --> 04:30.920
Can see, if you check out these paintings,

04:31.020 --> 04:35.325
I made these with my dad
when I was younger.

04:35.425 --> 04:38.795
So, I'm sure
you're anxious to get started...

04:38.895 --> 04:39.963
...     - Yeah.
- On all this.

04:40.063 --> 04:41.431
- Okay.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.999
- Let's get you over here.

04:43.099 --> 04:44.934
I am a cancer survivor.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.271
I had cancer in the liver,
spread to the lungs.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.472
So, pretty bad.

04:49.572 --> 04:50.807
They gave me the chemo.

04:50.907 --> 04:52.342
I knocked it out.

04:52.442 --> 04:53.943
Really, it was--
went into remission immediately.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.945
It was-- it was pretty incredible.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.914
Unfortunately, two months ago,

04:58.014 --> 05:01.851
I started getting these dizzy spells and...

05:01.951 --> 05:06.656
...   some--some sort of
weird cognitive misfirings.

05:06.756 --> 05:08.958
I went back in to see the doctor.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.927
Brain tumor size of a baseball here.

05:11.027 --> 05:12.929
- Oh, no.
- That's inoperable.

05:13.029 --> 05:16.332
Um, so they gave me about
two to three months to live.

05:16.432 --> 05:17.667
I'm hoping I beat it, you know?

05:17.767 --> 05:21.037
And the power of positive thinking.

05:21.137 --> 05:23.973
Maybe?
You know, who knows?

05:24.073 --> 05:28.544
But in case I don't,
I'm married.

05:28.644 --> 05:30.546
My beautiful wife, Angela,
of six years,

05:30.646 --> 05:32.348
is pregnant with our first child.

05:32.448 --> 05:33.483
Hi, Buddy.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.951
We're calling it Buddy.

05:35.051 --> 05:38.921
Um, and have you ever
seen the film My Life?

05:39.021 --> 05:40.390
- No.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.292
- It's a beautiful,
beautiful film.

05:42.392 --> 05:43.893
Michael Keaton gets cancer in the film,

05:43.993 --> 05:49.666
and he makes a video diary
of himself for his unborn son.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.634
- Oh, okay.
Yeah.

05:51.734 --> 05:53.069
- Yeah, you can see.

05:53.169 --> 05:56.005
So, our job today
is to keep that camera rolling,

05:56.105 --> 05:58.341
as we discussed,

05:58.441 --> 06:03.713
and I just want you to walk with me.

06:03.813 --> 06:05.381
I don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do.

06:05.481 --> 06:07.483
I want you to document me,
how I am.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.720
I don't need to glorify me
or make me seem cool...

06:10.820 --> 06:12.722
...   or anything other than what I am,

06:12.822 --> 06:17.360
so, Buddy, you can see me
for the man I was.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.595
And, um...

06:19.695 --> 06:22.075
... I hope you're up for it.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.803
- Okay.
- Yeah?

06:26.903 --> 06:28.471
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:28.571 --> 06:30.571
Let's do it.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.841
- I thought you were gonna run away.

06:31.941 --> 06:32.975
- No.

06:33.075 --> 06:35.075
Okay.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.049
- This is for you.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.684
- Oh, that's all right.
- No, no, no, no.

06:41.784 --> 06:43.784
Take the whole thing.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.355
This is, uh...

06:45.455 --> 06:48.024
...   this is no longer
a business transaction, okay?

06:48.124 --> 06:49.025
- Okay.

06:49.125 --> 06:52.128
- This is a partnership,

06:52.228 --> 06:55.465
and this is a journey into the heart,

06:55.565 --> 06:59.936
and I'm real glad
it's you coming with me.

07:00.036 --> 07:02.605
I think we're gonna do great.

07:02.705 --> 07:05.708
You ready for this?

07:05.808 --> 07:06.909
- Okay, let's do it.
- All right.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.389
I'm gonna go get in the tub.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.567
- In the tub?

07:15.651 --> 07:17.854
- Yeah, come on up.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.906
It's okay.
Come on.

07:35.988 --> 07:36.973
- Oh, sorry.

07:37.073 --> 07:38.141
- It's okay.
- Okay?

07:38.241 --> 07:39.409
- Yeah, yeah.

07:39.509 --> 07:41.677
We're--we're gonna go...

07:41.777 --> 07:44.582
...a lot deeper places than this.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.016
Okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

07:47.116 --> 07:48.484
- You sure?
- Yep.

07:48.584 --> 07:50.186
- Okay.
You sure you're not hungry?

07:50.286 --> 07:53.122
You want a sandwich or anything?
- No, I'm okay--I'm okay.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.425
- All right, maybe when we get
out of the tub.

07:55.525 --> 07:57.493
I'm getting in the tub.
You're not getting in the tub.

07:57.593 --> 07:58.728
- Okay.
- Okay?

07:58.828 --> 08:01.888
- Okay.
- All right, get comfortable.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.735
- Okay.

08:05.835 --> 08:07.470
- Okay, you rolling?
- Yep.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.006
- Just checking.
I knew you were.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.908
All right, Buddy.

08:12.008 --> 08:15.845
Welcome to your first tubby.

08:15.945 --> 08:17.079
When I was your age,

08:17.179 --> 08:18.548
I used to take tubbies with my dad.

08:18.648 --> 08:20.116
We'd call 'em tubby time,

08:20.216 --> 08:23.085
and it was pretty much
the greatest time of the day.

08:23.185 --> 08:26.956
So since you and I might not
get to do a tubby together,

08:27.056 --> 08:32.028
I thought we would have
our first tubby right here.

08:32.128 --> 08:33.863
You ready?

08:33.962 --> 08:34.931
Okay.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.566
All right.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.768
Now, let's get those tootsies wet.

08:38.868 --> 08:40.535
You ready?
Get those tootsies.

08:40.635 --> 08:41.636
Boo.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.006
Oh, ooh, it tickles, doesn't it?

08:44.106 --> 08:46.106
Oh, stinker.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.144
Stinker-roo.

08:48.244 --> 08:51.547
Oh.

08:51.647 --> 08:55.132
Ooh, this one
actually smells pretty good.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.553
I know, it's fun, isn't it?

08:57.653 --> 09:00.690
I know.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.174
Ooh.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.129
Just lean back and close your eyes.

09:07.229 --> 09:09.732
A little shampoo.

09:09.832 --> 09:12.668
A massage rub.

09:12.768 --> 09:14.036
Mmm.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.639
Yeah.

09:16.739 --> 09:17.807
Mmm.

09:17.907 --> 09:20.009
Now is my favorite part.

09:20.109 --> 09:23.946
We're just gonna lay back.

09:24.046 --> 09:25.581
Oh, Buddy.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.732
Oh, yeah.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.201
Ooh, ooh.

09:32.204 --> 09:34.706
Ooh, you like the fire?

09:35.775 --> 09:39.295
Mm.
You just stay here.

09:39.395 --> 09:41.395
We'll watch the fire.

09:43.916 --> 09:49.872
You and me.

09:49.972 --> 09:52.808
Mmm.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.993
I love you so much.

10:06.672 --> 10:09.647
Can't stop thinking about it,
Aaron.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.765
- What?

10:15.865 --> 10:20.603
- Two to three months.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.005
Most of which I will either be in pain,

10:23.105 --> 10:27.310
or at the very least sad.

10:27.410 --> 10:30.179
I mean, look at this scene.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.914
It's a tubby scene.

10:32.014 --> 10:33.316
It's supposed to be fun.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.561
It's not supposed to be sad,
you know?

10:39.071 --> 10:43.759
I just can't help thinking,

10:43.859 --> 10:45.859
'Why wait?'

10:49.048 --> 10:50.366
You know?

10:50.466 --> 10:55.387
'Cause I could just end it right now.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.724
I could, you know.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.291
- Josef?

11:15.391 --> 11:18.060
Hey.

11:18.160 --> 11:24.133
Josef?

11:24.233 --> 11:26.702
Hey.

11:26.802 --> 11:28.802
Josef.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.377
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

11:34.477 --> 11:36.245
Oh, man,
that was--that was a joke.

11:36.345 --> 11:38.014
It was supposed to be a joke.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.415
I'm so sorry.
That was a bad joke.

11:39.515 --> 11:41.050
Okay.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.718
I've got a weird sense of humor, man.

11:42.818 --> 11:44.954
I'm-- I'm really sorry about that.

11:45.054 --> 11:46.756
- It's okay.

11:46.856 --> 11:50.059
- Um, it was just getting,
like, really serious in here,

11:50.159 --> 11:54.981
and I was just, like, you know,
trying to lighten the mood.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.699
Do you want to go
outside or something?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.868
You want to get some fresh air?
Would that be good?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.436
- Yeah.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.438
- Oh, Aaron. You might want
a heavier jacket.

12:02.538 --> 12:04.273
It's a little chilly out there.
- Okay.

12:04.373 --> 12:05.908
- There's-- there should be something...

12:06.008 --> 12:07.109
...in the guest bedroom closet...

12:07.209 --> 12:08.110
... if you want to snag one.

12:08.210 --> 12:09.812
- Okay.

12:09.912 --> 12:13.398
Cool.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.118
- What? What?
What happened?

12:16.218 --> 12:19.255
What happened?

12:19.355 --> 12:20.256
Oh.

12:20.356 --> 12:21.457
That's Peachfuzz.

12:21.557 --> 12:23.859
That's--that's just Peachfuzz.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.261
Say hello.

12:25.361 --> 12:27.430
Um...

12:27.530 --> 12:29.765
...  Actually, you know,
I'm glad this happened.

12:29.865 --> 12:31.267
Buddy, you're gonna love this.

12:31.367 --> 12:34.172
So, Peachfuzz is a friendly wolf,

12:34.236 --> 12:36.038
and my dad created him...

12:36.138 --> 12:40.443
...and he actually used to have
this great kind of song...

12:40.543 --> 12:44.113
...  that Peachfuzz sings for little kids.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.981
What do you think, Buddy?

13:19.081 --> 13:20.316
That's Peachfuzz.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.416
Say hi.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.488
All right.

13:25.588 --> 13:26.822
Oh, nice.

13:26.922 --> 13:27.957
Look.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.760
Got some hats.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.860
Huh, twinsies.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.397
I'm over here, Buddy.

13:35.497 --> 13:37.333
Right here.

13:37.433 --> 13:39.935
So, look, there's a legend about
this trail that we're going to.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.805
It's called
Las Aguas Milagros de Corazon,

13:42.905 --> 13:45.908
which means, 'The miracle waters
of the heart.'

13:46.008 --> 13:47.176
Your mom and I heard about it...

13:47.276 --> 13:48.544
...  from this really cool Hispanic lady...

13:48.644 --> 13:49.779
... who runs this taco truck...

13:49.879 --> 13:51.180
...   down by the lake.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.382
Anyway, the lore has it that there's, like,

13:53.482 --> 13:55.551
a healing body of water out here...

13:55.651 --> 13:57.219
...   that has something to do with a heart,

13:57.319 --> 13:59.955
but apparently only those
who are pure of heart...

14:00.055 --> 14:01.423
...   can partake of it.

14:01.523 --> 14:05.127
So, anyhow, that is what
we're going to find today.

14:05.227 --> 14:09.098
How's your heart, Aaron?
- It's good.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.233
- It better be.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.268
Whoo-hoo.

14:12.368 --> 14:13.302
All right, Buddy.

14:13.402 --> 14:15.612
Let's go cure some cancer.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.497
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.118
Did you see that?
- No.

14:29.218 --> 14:32.121
Did you see anything up there?
- Uh-uh.

14:32.221 --> 14:34.221
What was it?

14:39.011 --> 14:41.561
- I thought I heard something.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.921
- Josef?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.667
Josef?

15:11.977 --> 15:13.977
Hey, man.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.249
Is everything okay?

15:39.372 --> 15:40.656
Oh, my God.

15:40.756 --> 15:42.591
Aaron.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.126
Obviously you didn't see your face.

15:44.226 --> 15:45.527
Holy cow.

15:45.627 --> 15:46.962
You--here.

15:47.062 --> 15:48.230
I just need to show you something.

15:48.330 --> 15:51.066
You need to see your face.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.268
All right, you're a little mad.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.569
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

15:53.669 --> 15:56.639
- But oh, my God,
that was incredible.

15:56.739 --> 16:00.376
That was--you just
had a near-death experience.

16:00.476 --> 16:01.543
- Yeah.

16:01.643 --> 16:03.078
- That's what it feels like...

16:03.178 --> 16:04.680
...   when you feel like you're gonna die.

16:04.780 --> 16:07.583
It's incredible, isn't it?

16:07.683 --> 16:09.551
- Yeah.

16:09.651 --> 16:10.953
- You all right?
- Yeah.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.187
I'm fine. Thanks.
Thank you.

16:12.287 --> 16:14.089
- All right.

16:14.189 --> 16:16.692
It's powerful, isn't it?
- Yeah, it is.

16:16.792 --> 16:20.996
- You know,
what's really amazing is,

16:21.096 --> 16:22.264
there was about two seconds there...

16:22.364 --> 16:25.167
...after you were done being scared...

16:25.267 --> 16:28.287
...  where it looked like
you wanted to kill me.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.506
- No, I-I-I was-- it was just the--...

16:30.606 --> 16:32.374
...- I don't take it personally.

16:32.474 --> 16:34.243
I think it was
a visceral reaction, you know?

16:34.343 --> 16:36.679
It's a defense thing, but--...

16:36.779 --> 16:40.149
...but there's an animal in you.

16:40.249 --> 16:44.035
There's a little Peachfuzz inside you yet.

16:47.673 --> 16:51.593
Anybody you need to make peace
with in this world?

16:51.693 --> 16:53.693
Before you go?

16:56.115 --> 16:57.733
- I have an ex.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.601
- You have an axe?
- Ex.

16:59.701 --> 17:01.170
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna tell me you had,

17:01.270 --> 17:02.171
like, an axe to grind.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.440
I have an axe back at the house.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.175
- Yeah.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.275
No, I saw it.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.646
- Can I ask you a question
and you'll answer me honestly?

17:10.746 --> 17:12.614
- Okay.

17:12.714 --> 17:15.651
- When you saw that axe
out in front of the house,

17:15.751 --> 17:17.152
was there a small part of you...

17:17.252 --> 17:21.077
...    that thought I might kill you with it?

17:21.306 --> 17:23.192
- Yeah, but I didn't know you.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.594
- You did?

17:25.694 --> 17:28.597
That's great.

17:28.697 --> 17:33.202
- Josef, I don't remember
how long we've been walking for.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.170
Are you getting hungry?
- Yeah, I know, I know.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.472
But you're doing great and just--...

17:36.572 --> 17:38.007
... we got to keep in motion.

17:38.107 --> 17:39.308
- Okay.
- Look.

17:39.408 --> 17:40.342
Look.
There's a sign.

17:40.442 --> 17:42.442
Hey.
Little something.

17:43.562 --> 17:47.217
- All right.
- Healing waters, here we come.

17:50.269 --> 17:52.554
- 'Sewer pipeline.'

17:52.654 --> 17:53.655
It's shit water.

17:53.755 --> 17:56.125
- It's something.

17:56.225 --> 17:57.126
Better than nothing.

17:57.226 --> 17:59.261
Come on.

17:59.361 --> 18:00.362
- Josef.

18:00.462 --> 18:01.563
- What's up?

18:01.663 --> 18:02.598
- Are you--...

18:02.698 --> 18:04.633
...you remember how to get back?

18:04.733 --> 18:08.270
- No. I don't.

18:08.370 --> 18:09.438
- Okay.

18:09.538 --> 18:11.340
It's just we've taken a lot of--...

18:11.440 --> 18:13.042
...a lot of forks in the road,

18:13.142 --> 18:14.476
switchbacks that--...

18:14.576 --> 18:16.078
...  I just--I haven't been keeping track, so...

18:16.178 --> 18:17.546
...  - I haven't either.

18:17.646 --> 18:19.114
But that's--I mean,
that's back there, man.

18:19.214 --> 18:20.449
We got to--...

18:20.549 --> 18:22.351
...  We got to go forward.
- Okay.

18:22.451 --> 18:24.186
- You know,
we can't find the miracle...

18:24.286 --> 18:26.822
...if we got a rope attached to us,
you know what I'm saying?

18:26.922 --> 18:28.922
- Right.

18:31.376 --> 18:32.795
- Holy shit.

18:32.895 --> 18:35.564
Holy shit.
Holy shit.

18:35.664 --> 18:38.767
- Josef.

18:38.867 --> 18:42.805
- Come see.
It's a lookout point.

18:42.905 --> 18:44.905
See?

18:54.166 --> 18:56.452
Aaron.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.753
- Yeah?

18:57.853 --> 19:01.083
- You are not gonna ever believe this.

19:08.714 --> 19:12.634
Aaron, I want you
to point your camera down there...

19:12.734 --> 19:15.199
... and tell me what you see.

19:22.761 --> 19:26.615
- Oh, my God.

19:26.715 --> 19:31.353
It's a heart, man.

19:31.453 --> 19:33.663
That's a heart down there.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.494
You were right.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.829
- It's a heart.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.969
But it's also a miracle.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.605
Only the pure of heart can be healed.

19:49.705 --> 19:51.473
Yes.

19:51.573 --> 19:53.953
Heal those big ol' tootsies.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.512
Amazing.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.612
Whoo-hoo.

19:59.865 --> 20:00.883
- Whoo-hoo.

20:00.983 --> 20:02.651
- It's chilly, huh?

20:02.751 --> 20:03.719
All right.

20:03.819 --> 20:05.420
Whoo.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.389
- Whoo.

20:07.489 --> 20:10.692
- Yeah.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.792
Okay, you do me.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.218
Tell you what.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.687
I know a little place called Billy Bear's.

20:38.787 --> 20:40.522
It has the best god damn
pancakes in the world.

20:40.622 --> 20:42.691
You still hungry?
- Yeah.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.459
- All right.
I'm buying lunch.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.328
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's get out of here.

20:46.428 --> 20:47.496
- Okay.

20:47.596 --> 20:49.198
- Let's see what's good here.

20:49.298 --> 20:51.593
- It's the pancakes, right?

20:52.784 --> 20:54.636
Didn't you say you used to
come here with your family?

20:54.736 --> 20:56.271
- What's that?

20:56.371 --> 20:58.740
- Didn't you used to
come here for years?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.275
- Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:00.375 --> 21:01.610
No, it's just they changed the menu,

21:01.710 --> 21:03.478
so I was just curious...

21:03.578 --> 21:04.513
...if there was anything else,

21:04.613 --> 21:05.781
but yeah, I mean,

21:05.881 --> 21:09.885
obviously the pancakes are the thing.

21:09.985 --> 21:12.287
Hey, Aaron.

21:12.387 --> 21:14.387
- Yeah?

21:17.643 --> 21:21.747
- Have you ever done anything
you're really ashamed of?

21:21.847 --> 21:22.998
- Yeah.

21:23.098 --> 21:26.301
- Would you mind telling me about it?

21:26.401 --> 21:29.004
- Uh, yeah, okay.

21:29.104 --> 21:30.005
- Really?

21:30.105 --> 21:31.440
Here, give me the camera.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.574
Come on, I'll-- it'll be fun.

21:32.674 --> 21:33.575
I'll...

21:33.675 --> 21:34.776
...     - Okay.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.411
- Take the focus
off of me for a second.

21:36.511 --> 21:38.511
There we go.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.550
Handsome devil.

21:41.650 --> 21:43.650
- Um, okay.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.422
Um, I guess-- let me think.

21:47.522 --> 21:50.959
I was, um...

21:51.059 --> 21:52.394
...    I used to--...

21:52.494 --> 21:55.639
...I used to just pee my pants a lot,

21:55.697 --> 21:56.698
um, when I was a little kid.

21:56.798 --> 21:57.699
- Ooh.

21:57.799 --> 21:59.799
- And, um...

21:59.868 --> 22:03.905
...  it got to the point
where my mom got this, uh...

22:04.005 --> 22:08.910
... device from a mail-order
catalogue that was, um...

22:09.010 --> 22:13.015
...it was like a--like a thing
attached to my wrist...

22:13.115 --> 22:17.853
...with a wire that went up my arm
and down my shirt...

22:17.953 --> 22:19.621
...    into my pants.

22:19.721 --> 22:22.658
- And with a little sensor on it that would--...

22:22.758 --> 22:25.694
...that would beep at the sound
of--or at the--...

22:25.794 --> 22:28.430
...     it would-- when it felt wetness.

22:28.530 --> 22:32.000
And, uh, I remember one time...

22:32.100 --> 22:35.604
...  when I was just out on
the monkey bars with my friends,

22:35.704 --> 22:37.072
I had to go really bad,

22:37.172 --> 22:38.907
and I didn't want to,

22:39.007 --> 22:45.013
and I just--I just started
just pissing my pants.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.949
And then--and then the monitor
starting going off,

22:48.049 --> 22:53.021
and so there I was,
you know, laying in the sand...

22:53.121 --> 22:59.394
...just with piss all over myself
and this loud alarm going off.

22:59.494 --> 23:00.962
And that was probably the first time,

23:01.062 --> 23:04.366
or at least the first time
I remember, feeling--...

23:04.466 --> 23:05.901
...    feeling shame.

23:06.001 --> 23:08.370
- Thanks for sharing that with me, man.

23:08.470 --> 23:09.738
- Yeah.

23:09.838 --> 23:11.406
- It's not easy to talk about that stuff.

23:11.506 --> 23:14.076
I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

23:14.176 --> 23:16.645
Okay.

23:16.745 --> 23:19.514
- Can I have a turn?

23:19.614 --> 23:20.849
- Uh, yeah.

23:20.949 --> 23:22.949
Okay.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.776
What?

23:47.876 --> 23:52.514
What is that?

23:52.614 --> 23:54.614
Is that--...

23:57.702 --> 23:58.920
...     That's me.

23:59.020 --> 24:02.758
- Yeah.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.858
I took pictures of you.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.982
- Okay.

24:16.087 --> 24:17.773
Why?

24:17.873 --> 24:19.873
- I don't know.

24:24.963 --> 24:31.620
I suppose I was nervous
before you came up,

24:31.720 --> 24:34.689
and I felt that if I got to know you...

24:34.789 --> 24:38.560
... before you got to know me,

24:38.660 --> 24:41.040
then I would be less scared.

24:47.519 --> 24:50.672
I'm sorry.

24:50.772 --> 24:53.508
I wouldn't have done it...

24:53.608 --> 24:57.433
...   if I knew you then like I know you now.

24:59.764 --> 25:04.694
And I'm very ashamed of it,
and I hope we can move past it.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.914
Okay?

25:19.618 --> 25:21.169
- Okay.
No, I'm--it's--...

25:21.269 --> 25:24.739
...  it's a little weird,
but I'm--I'm past it.

25:24.839 --> 25:27.642
- You are?

25:27.742 --> 25:28.743
- Yeah.

25:28.843 --> 25:30.843
Yeah, it's fine.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.233
- Thank you.

25:47.846 --> 25:48.864
- Josef.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.832
- Yeah?

25:50.932 --> 25:52.932
- I think--...

25:52.934 --> 25:55.237
...I think I'm gonna head back.

25:55.337 --> 25:57.739
Um, I got--...

25:57.839 --> 25:59.908
... I got all my stuff on me.

26:00.008 --> 26:05.180
I just think I'll just
head back down the hill now.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.816
- Oh.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.918
Oh.

26:10.018 --> 26:13.203
I was going to pour you a whiskey.

26:19.177 --> 26:20.662
- Yeah, no.
It's okay.

26:20.762 --> 26:23.298
I-I think, uh...

26:23.398 --> 26:25.066
... I think it's a long drive,

26:25.166 --> 26:29.137
and it's kind of treacherous
going down the hill.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.672
I think I'll just--...

26:30.772 --> 26:33.675
...- It takes about 20 minutes going down.

26:33.775 --> 26:36.711
You can coast the whole way; it's not--...

26:36.811 --> 26:42.050
...   I think we should
commemorate our day, Aaron.

26:42.150 --> 26:47.822
I feel like we should
raise our glasses together...

26:47.922 --> 26:49.922
...    and celebrate.

26:53.378 --> 26:55.664
One drink, okay?

26:55.764 --> 26:59.674
One drink, and I'll send you
on your merry way.

27:02.253 --> 27:04.139
Please?

27:04.239 --> 27:06.274
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.374
- One drink.
- Great.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.822
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.

27:20.922 --> 27:21.923
I keep doing that.

27:22.023 --> 27:24.023
Come on, let's go.

27:25.944 --> 27:27.944
This is great, huh?

27:27.996 --> 27:30.799
Two guys having some whiskeys.

27:30.899 --> 27:31.833
It's really great, man.

27:31.933 --> 27:34.035
What a great day, you know?

27:34.135 --> 27:35.604
And I don't take my days lightly.

27:35.704 --> 27:36.871
I mean, really.

27:36.971 --> 27:38.173
I could've spent it with my family,

27:38.273 --> 27:40.775
but I made a new friend.

27:40.875 --> 27:42.875
Just a great day.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.646
- Yeah, it was a good day.
- Yeah.

27:44.746 --> 27:45.947
What made you decide to come up here...

27:46.047 --> 27:48.682
...and do this with me, anyway?

27:50.301 --> 27:52.053
- I guess it was a job.

27:52.153 --> 27:54.356
- The money, huh?

27:54.456 --> 27:55.790
- Yeah.

27:55.890 --> 27:59.761
- You having money problems,
Aaron?

27:59.861 --> 28:01.129
- No.
- It's okay.

28:01.229 --> 28:02.664
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.059
People have money problems.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.137
- I mean, it's tough,
but, you know--...

28:09.237 --> 28:11.039
... - Of course it's tough.

28:11.139 --> 28:14.409
When I was your age, I didn't
have a row to hoe, you know?

28:14.509 --> 28:17.979
It took a while before I
accumulated the wealth I have,

28:18.079 --> 28:21.883
and I've actually accumulated quite a bit.

28:21.983 --> 28:24.386
And, um...

28:24.486 --> 28:26.054
...     I've been thinking about it today,

28:26.154 --> 28:31.059
and I want to give
you some money, Aaron.

28:31.159 --> 28:32.193
- No, thank--...

28:32.293 --> 28:33.928
...That's--that's nice of you,

28:34.028 --> 28:35.864
but it's okay.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.433
- Why is everyone
so uncomfortable with money?

28:38.533 --> 28:40.135
Look, if you had an excess of food,

28:40.235 --> 28:43.975
and I was hungry,
wouldn't you give it to me?

28:44.255 --> 28:46.295
- Yeah.
- Yes, you would.

28:46.341 --> 28:48.977
Because you're my friend,
and you're kind.

28:49.077 --> 28:51.980
I have an excess of money.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.949
You have a need.

28:55.049 --> 28:55.950
It's simple.

28:56.050 --> 28:57.919
- Oh, I--...

28:58.019 --> 29:01.759
...   - There's a check in your boot, Aaron.

29:04.976 --> 29:06.227
Gotcha.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.929
All right.

29:08.029 --> 29:09.230
Sorry.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.865
There's not a check in your boot,

29:10.965 --> 29:14.135
but you looked,
which means you need money.

29:14.235 --> 29:16.304
Let me help you.

29:16.404 --> 29:18.373
We don't have to figure it out now.

29:18.473 --> 29:21.242
Just saying.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.444
- Okay, um...

29:22.544 --> 29:24.279
...     - Here.
Cheers, to us.

29:24.379 --> 29:26.379
- Okay, cheers.

29:30.168 --> 29:31.419
All right.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.644
Well, I think we're good.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.257
Um...

29:36.357 --> 29:38.393
...   - Where are you-- are you leaving?

29:38.493 --> 29:41.029
- Here.
- Aaron, are you leaving?

29:41.129 --> 29:43.431
- I think it's-- yeah, I think, um...

29:43.531 --> 29:45.531
...   - I lied to you.

29:54.159 --> 29:56.159
- What--what about?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.966
- Peachfuzz.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.290
Aaron, if I tell you something,

30:09.390 --> 30:14.062
would you promise me you would
never tell another living soul?

30:14.162 --> 30:18.327
I need to get something
off of my chest, before...

30:22.420 --> 30:25.206
...     - Okay.

30:25.306 --> 30:26.274
- But this is only for you.

30:26.374 --> 30:28.374
Buddy, I'm sorry.

30:28.409 --> 30:30.912
This is not for you to hear.

30:31.012 --> 30:35.483
Aaron, would you sit down please
and turn the camera off?

30:35.583 --> 30:37.085
- Um...
- Now.

30:37.185 --> 30:39.185
- Okay.

30:47.979 --> 30:49.230
Okay.

30:49.330 --> 30:50.331
- It's off?
- Yeah, it's off.

30:50.431 --> 30:52.431
- Okay.

30:54.953 --> 30:59.474
I did something really bad.

30:59.574 --> 31:03.311
About four years ago...

31:03.411 --> 31:08.216
...  the internet started
to slow down at our house.

31:08.316 --> 31:12.120
Spoke to a guy I knew at work who said...

31:12.220 --> 31:16.974
... maybe my browser's history was full.

31:18.076 --> 31:19.260
I went home.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.279
I opened up the internet.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.362
Aaron, such unspeakable things I saw.

31:34.592 --> 31:36.592
Pornography.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.996
Mostly animal pornography.

31:42.066 --> 31:45.620
There's only two people
who use that internet.

31:45.720 --> 31:50.191
Me and my wife, Angela.

31:50.291 --> 31:54.541
And I was not looking
at animal pornography, Aaron.

31:56.281 --> 31:59.000
I confronted Angela.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.336
She flat-out denied it.

32:01.436 --> 32:03.436
What could I say?

32:05.189 --> 32:07.942
I knew it was her.

32:08.042 --> 32:10.345
This lie drove a wedge between us,

32:10.445 --> 32:13.697
and we began to drift apart.

32:17.068 --> 32:22.357
One weekend, I said we should
come up to the cabin.

32:22.457 --> 32:24.993
Right here.

32:25.093 --> 32:27.428
But on Saturday,
I was called back to work,

32:27.528 --> 32:30.333
so I left Angela here by herself.

32:32.583 --> 32:37.105
The thing is, I wasn't really
called back to work.

32:37.205 --> 32:41.525
I went down the street
to the 99 cent store.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.463
There I found a mask.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.566
It was a wolf.

32:52.270 --> 32:56.557
Three hours later,
I came back to the house.

32:56.657 --> 32:59.594
I put the mask on.

32:59.694 --> 33:02.669
I broke in through the back window.

33:03.715 --> 33:07.235
Angela was asleep.

33:07.335 --> 33:09.070
I tied her up,

33:09.170 --> 33:11.940
at which point she awoke.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.574
At which point,

33:13.674 --> 33:15.944
we proceeded to have...

33:16.044 --> 33:21.131
...  ravenous, animalistic
sexual intercourse.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.949
I'd never seen her so happy.

33:29.207 --> 33:33.457
I have to admit, it didn't
feel terrible on my end.

33:35.146 --> 33:40.535
I escaped through the window
and left her there, tied up.

33:40.635 --> 33:43.972
When I came back
the next morning, as myself,

33:44.072 --> 33:46.622
I asked her how her night was.

33:48.593 --> 33:55.065
She said it was fine,
with a casual smile.

33:59.404 --> 34:01.404
We never spoke of it.

34:03.408 --> 34:06.194
We went home.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.498
And in the weeks that followed,

34:10.598 --> 34:14.351
the internet got back up to speed.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.018
Aaron, I raped my own wife.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.385
So, in summation, this is me
in a nutshell, you know?

34:30.485 --> 34:33.688
This is your dear old dad,
warts and all.

34:33.788 --> 34:36.123
I want to say that I love you, Buddy.

34:36.224 --> 34:39.027
And, um...

34:39.127 --> 34:40.328
...     - Okay.

34:40.428 --> 34:41.329
- I think that's good.

34:41.429 --> 34:43.130
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:43.231 --> 34:45.065
I think that was great.

34:45.166 --> 34:46.567
That didn't feel great to me.

34:46.667 --> 34:50.071
- No, I think-- I think we got it.

34:50.170 --> 34:53.608
- I don't know,
that wasn't very certain.

34:53.708 --> 34:56.244
- Have you seen my keys?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.612
They're in your jacket, right?

34:57.712 --> 35:01.649
- Yeah,
I thought they were.

35:01.749 --> 35:05.620
- Well, maybe they're
in your jeans or something?

35:05.720 --> 35:06.821
- I don't know.

35:06.921 --> 35:08.921
- On the table?

35:10.341 --> 35:12.627
I feel like if we get
one more take, we'll nail this.

35:12.727 --> 35:14.495
- You know what?
I really think that was good.

35:14.595 --> 35:17.740
I really think that was the one, man.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.170
- Is everything okay, Aaron?

35:22.270 --> 35:23.237
- Yeah, just--...

35:23.337 --> 35:25.337
...    Yeah, we're--...

35:31.262 --> 35:33.262
...     - Aaron.

35:33.314 --> 35:35.516
- Yeah?

35:35.616 --> 35:39.101
- Did I freak you out with my rape story?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.725
- No.

35:44.825 --> 35:48.329
- Why are you in such a hurry?

35:48.429 --> 35:49.864
- Just--...

35:49.964 --> 35:53.134
... - Aaron, come here, look.

35:53.234 --> 35:54.402
You can stay here.

35:54.502 --> 35:56.637
I've got plenty of comfortable beds.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.539
You know, we got--
there's whiskey here.

35:58.639 --> 35:59.540
It's a long drive down to--...

35:59.640 --> 36:01.809
...- Josef, I need to go home.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.711
- I know, Aaron.

36:03.811 --> 36:05.146
I know you need to go home.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.447
But what I'm telling you...

36:06.547 --> 36:08.649
...  is that we cannot find your keys.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.284
It's dark in this house.

36:10.384 --> 36:12.320
Technically,
you are over 0.08.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.654
If you get pulled over by the police,

36:13.754 --> 36:15.423
you will get a DUI.

36:15.523 --> 36:18.292
In the morning, this house'll be
flooded with light.

36:18.392 --> 36:19.594
We'll find your keys.

36:19.694 --> 36:20.828
You'll be sober.

36:20.928 --> 36:24.398
And you can drive home then.

36:24.498 --> 36:26.498
You understand?

36:35.560 --> 36:37.600
Sorry I raised my voice.

36:40.831 --> 36:43.417
- Sorry I got a little antsy back there.

36:43.517 --> 36:46.387
- That's okay.

36:46.487 --> 36:47.822
- Yeah, I just-- I think the roads...

36:47.922 --> 36:50.387
... are probably treacherous.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.792
It's a good call.
- Yeah.

36:51.892 --> 36:53.728
This is the right move.
- Yeah.

36:53.828 --> 36:54.795
- Yeah.

36:54.895 --> 36:56.197
- Absolutely.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.732
- Yep.

36:57.832 --> 36:59.832
Good.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.941
- All right.

37:07.041 --> 37:07.942
Here we go.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.343
- All right.

37:09.443 --> 37:11.443
Oh, it's a big one.

37:11.512 --> 37:12.780
- Bottoms up.

37:12.880 --> 37:14.880
- Bottoms up?

37:14.949 --> 37:16.384
Well, all right.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.484
If you say so.

37:20.771 --> 37:21.722
Ah.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.822
Ooh.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.561
Okay.

37:26.661 --> 37:27.762
I want to do my final take again.

37:27.862 --> 37:29.597
Is this thing still set?

37:29.697 --> 37:31.697
- Yeah.
We're good.

37:33.284 --> 37:37.271
- So, in summation, Buddy,

37:37.371 --> 37:40.541
I just want us-- let me start that over.

37:40.641 --> 37:41.542
- You're doing good.

37:41.642 --> 37:42.543
- You sure?
- Yeah.

37:42.643 --> 37:44.278
- Okay.

37:44.378 --> 37:47.297
So, in summation, Buddy, um...

37:52.303 --> 37:53.921
That didn't taste weird to you?

37:54.021 --> 37:56.021
- No, it was good.

37:56.057 --> 37:57.458
Do you want another?

37:57.558 --> 37:59.709
- No.
I'm good.

38:05.383 --> 38:10.271
So, in summation, Buddy,

38:10.371 --> 38:14.791
I love you,
and I miss you.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.328
I'm sorry I died.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.334
Just, it feels weird.

38:33.678 --> 38:35.678
- Josef?

38:42.687 --> 38:43.838
- Oh, what'd you do?

38:43.938 --> 38:44.972
What-- Aaron, what'd you do?

38:45.072 --> 38:45.973
Why did you do that?

38:46.073 --> 38:46.974
Aaron, why did you do that?

38:47.074 --> 38:48.643
Aaron, what did you do?

38:48.743 --> 38:49.810
What did you do?

38:49.910 --> 38:51.312
- It's okay.
Go to sleep.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.414
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep...

38:53.514 --> 38:55.894
...     It's okay.
It's okay.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.639
- Hello, Peachfuzz.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.562
Mmm, Peachfuzz.

39:08.662 --> 39:10.464
- No, Josef.

39:10.564 --> 39:14.402
- Mmm, Peachfuzz.

39:14.502 --> 39:16.637
- Josef.

39:16.737 --> 39:18.737
- Mmm.

39:21.559 --> 39:24.945
You should come lay with me.

39:25.045 --> 39:28.716
I'm tired.

39:28.816 --> 39:30.816
I love you so much.

39:32.403 --> 39:34.471
I'm so sorry.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.643
Stay up all night.

41:04.161 --> 41:05.780
- Hello?

41:05.880 --> 41:07.515
- Hello?

41:07.615 --> 41:08.849
- Angela?

41:08.949 --> 41:10.751
- Josef?

41:10.851 --> 41:12.851
- No, this is Aaron.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.689
- Oh.
Is Josef there, please?

41:15.789 --> 41:19.527
- He's--he's sleeping.

41:19.627 --> 41:21.762
- I'm sorry, who is this?

41:21.862 --> 41:22.863
- Aaron.

41:22.963 --> 41:24.832
Your husband hired me.

41:24.932 --> 41:26.434
- What?

41:26.534 --> 41:29.069
- Your husband hired me to film him.

41:29.169 --> 41:31.169
For the cancer.

41:32.523 --> 41:35.142
- Where are you right now,
Aaron?

41:35.242 --> 41:37.978
- We're at your house in Crestline.

41:38.078 --> 41:38.979
- You're where?

41:39.079 --> 41:41.079
Ugh, okay.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.817
Never mind.

41:42.917 --> 41:44.652
Listen, I'm gonna recommend
that you go ahead...

41:44.752 --> 41:47.888
... and just leave right now.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.623
- What the fuck's going on?

41:49.723 --> 41:51.158
- Nothing.

41:51.258 --> 41:55.529
You just go ahead and exit the house.

41:55.629 --> 41:56.597
You will be fine.

41:56.697 --> 41:57.865
- Lady, I'm trying to leave.

41:57.965 --> 41:59.733
I can't find my fucking car keys.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.202
- Okay.
That's okay.

42:01.302 --> 42:04.171
Just give me the address
of where you are...

42:04.271 --> 42:06.607
...    and then just
walk out of there right now.

42:06.707 --> 42:08.747
Just keep walking, okay?

42:09.894 --> 42:12.189
- Am I in danger right now?

42:15.199 --> 42:17.567
- My brother has problems.

42:19.069 --> 42:22.857
- Brother?

42:22.957 --> 42:26.560
Josef's your brother?

42:26.660 --> 42:30.831
That's-- your brother has cancer?

42:30.931 --> 42:33.167
- Listen to me, Aaron.

42:33.267 --> 42:37.262
You need to get
out of that house right now--...

42:38.256 --> 42:40.557
...   - Hello? Hello?

42:41.692 --> 42:43.692
Shit.

42:48.265 --> 42:50.265
Oh.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.904
Shit.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.352
Death.

44:31.452 --> 44:33.452
- It's coming.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.557
There's nothing we can do.

44:53.757 --> 44:56.052
I don't want to die, Aaron.

44:58.028 --> 45:00.028
I don't want to--...

45:01.966 --> 45:06.320
...  I don't want to die.

45:06.420 --> 45:08.689
Oh, Aaron.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.789
Oh, God.

45:15.913 --> 45:17.231
- I know.

45:17.331 --> 45:19.166
- I know you know.

45:19.266 --> 45:20.267
I love you.

45:20.367 --> 45:21.268
You're such a good friend.

45:21.368 --> 45:23.368
I love you so much.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.291
- Josef.

45:31.361 --> 45:32.746
I know.

45:32.846 --> 45:34.846
- I know you know.

45:37.468 --> 45:40.220
- Josef.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.700
I know what's going on here.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.694
I know you're troubled.

45:46.794 --> 45:48.794
I'm willing to help.

45:51.448 --> 45:53.448
Look, I'm not angry.

45:55.319 --> 45:59.339
So, just give me my keys,
and we'll--...

45:59.439 --> 46:01.904
... we'll take it from there.

46:05.829 --> 46:07.869
I talked to Angela, man.

47:01.051 --> 47:03.051
Josef.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.487
Please let me go.

47:13.864 --> 47:15.904
Are you gonna let me go?

47:19.036 --> 47:21.501
Why are you doing this to me?

47:24.474 --> 47:27.094
Are you--are you
just trying to scare me?

47:27.194 --> 47:30.464
Or--okay, look.

47:30.564 --> 47:33.133
Well, I'm terrified, okay?

47:33.233 --> 47:35.384
You won.

47:37.055 --> 47:41.475
- Now, will you just
please step aside and let me go?

47:42.159 --> 47:43.410
Stop.

47:43.510 --> 47:45.510
Stop it.

47:45.512 --> 47:47.512
Stop it.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.865
Stop it.

47:49.868 --> 47:51.868
- Stop it.

49:33.136 --> 49:37.124
Okay, um, so a little--...

49:37.224 --> 49:41.194
...  a little context here.

49:41.294 --> 49:45.632
After our scuffle,
I don't know where he went.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.167
He just ran off.

49:47.267 --> 49:48.402
I, uh...

49:48.502 --> 49:51.505
... I had to get my car towed.

49:51.605 --> 49:55.175
And now I'm home.

49:55.275 --> 49:58.378
And, you know,
I-I thought this was over.

49:58.478 --> 50:00.447
I was just writing it off...

50:00.547 --> 50:04.651
...  as just a weird thing that happened.

50:04.751 --> 50:11.224
And, lo and behold,
a few days later,

50:11.324 --> 50:16.063
I got this in the mail,

50:16.163 --> 50:18.298
which means he knows my address.

50:18.398 --> 50:20.948
That's a little disconcerting.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.676
I don't know, I'm kind of having
trouble interpreting it.

50:29.776 --> 50:33.380
I-I guess that's a--...

50:33.480 --> 50:35.482
...    he's supposed
to be digging a grave there...

50:35.582 --> 50:39.720
...    and, you know,
there's these bags.

50:39.820 --> 50:44.835
I don't know if that's supposed
to be a body or something...

50:44.858 --> 50:48.595
...in the bags that's chopped up.

50:48.695 --> 50:52.432
Um, I don't know.

50:52.532 --> 50:55.337
I mean,
is that supposed to be me?

50:55.368 --> 50:56.737
Okay.
You know what?

50:56.837 --> 50:58.138
No.

50:58.238 --> 51:02.542
We are just going to get rid of this...

51:02.642 --> 51:06.042
...   and pretend like it didn't happen.

51:10.133 --> 51:11.651
There we go.

51:11.751 --> 51:13.751
That's it.

51:17.474 --> 51:19.092
Okay.

51:19.192 --> 51:24.164
Maybe that's not it.

51:24.264 --> 51:27.749
I've been having
crazy ass dreams tonight.

51:29.853 --> 51:34.523
And it's me and Josef,
and we're at the Heart Rock.

51:36.593 --> 51:39.112
Only it's a hot tub.

51:39.212 --> 51:41.381
And we're just--...

51:41.481 --> 51:42.716
... we're both sitting in it,

51:42.816 --> 51:48.121
and he's got the Peachfuzz mask on,

51:48.221 --> 51:49.423
and I don't think that's weird...

51:49.523 --> 51:51.124
...'cause I have one on too.

51:51.224 --> 51:55.796
Only mine's like a--
like a--like a baby mask.

51:55.896 --> 51:58.432
Baby wolf.

51:58.532 --> 52:02.836
And we're drinking wine.

52:02.936 --> 52:05.205
And then he leans over to me,

52:05.305 --> 52:11.778
and he just starts
pouring the wine over my head.

52:11.878 --> 52:16.716
And I look down and I realize I'm--...

52:16.816 --> 52:22.622
...   I'm a little baby,
and he's giving me a tubby.

52:22.722 --> 52:26.793
And there's something weird
about the water.

52:26.893 --> 52:30.197
I put my hand in it and reach up,

52:30.297 --> 52:36.152
and it's just covered in blood.

52:38.522 --> 52:42.158
It's just a weird dream.

52:47.197 --> 52:50.427
I got to stop thinking about this guy.

52:53.537 --> 52:57.357
Just heard the doorbell ring
while I was in the bathroom,

52:57.457 --> 53:03.179
and the delivery guy
left this on my doorstep.

53:05.282 --> 53:07.234
There's no return address,

53:07.334 --> 53:12.188
so I have a good idea who it's from.

54:21.725 --> 54:22.909
- Hey.

54:23.009 --> 54:24.811
So, um,
just to clear the air,

54:24.911 --> 54:28.882
I do want to apologize
for that last video I sent you.

54:28.982 --> 54:30.450
It was a little manipulative...

54:30.550 --> 54:31.985
...     and a bit of an emotional response...

54:32.085 --> 54:35.422
...and, um, I'm sorry about that.

54:35.522 --> 54:36.590
But in all fairness.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.291
I wasn't quite in my right head...

54:38.391 --> 54:42.329
...    because, well,
you did drug me.

54:42.429 --> 54:44.464
I found the empty Benadryl
bottle in the house...

54:44.564 --> 54:49.970
...  and, um, I got to say,
pretty cool move.

54:50.070 --> 54:52.939
So, the way I see it is tit-for-tat,

54:53.039 --> 54:54.241
no hard feelings,

54:54.341 --> 54:56.009
but just in case,

54:56.109 --> 54:57.644
I thought I'd send you this little gift...

54:57.744 --> 54:58.745
... to clear the air between us...

54:58.845 --> 55:00.447
... and make sure we're cool.

55:00.547 --> 55:02.482
I'm assuming by now
you have the knife...

55:02.582 --> 55:04.751
...  and you have the video you're watching.

55:04.851 --> 55:06.586
But if you haven't found
the third element,

55:06.686 --> 55:08.588
I would encourage
you to press pause now...

55:08.688 --> 55:11.068
... and dig a little deeper.

55:51.047 --> 55:56.369
I love wolves
because they love deeply,

55:56.469 --> 55:57.704
but they don't know how to express it...

55:57.804 --> 55:59.572
...and they're often very violent...

55:59.672 --> 56:03.476
... and, quite frankly, murder
the things that they love...

56:03.576 --> 56:09.516
...  and inside of the wolf
is this beautiful heart.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.917
And yeah, it's misguided.

56:11.017 --> 56:13.453
And yeah, occasionally
it murders things...

56:13.553 --> 56:15.455
...  and this little wolf was so cute,

56:15.555 --> 56:18.491
it reminded me of you honestly.

56:18.591 --> 56:20.360
You know, that moment
I scared you in the woods,

56:20.460 --> 56:21.895
and it was--there was murder
in your eyes,

56:21.995 --> 56:23.563
but it was, like-- it was baby murder.

56:23.663 --> 56:25.665
You're not ready to accept that yet.

56:25.765 --> 56:30.003
But I want to encourage you
to embrace your inner wolf.

56:30.103 --> 56:31.071
So take the wolf.

56:31.171 --> 56:32.605
Enjoy it.

56:32.705 --> 56:36.509
And more importantly,
take the knife...

56:36.609 --> 56:37.944
...   and don't be afraid to murder it,

56:38.044 --> 56:41.081
because when you stick a knife
in something...

56:41.181 --> 56:45.652
...    and you gut it
and you really dig inside,

56:45.752 --> 56:47.120
I don't know, man.

56:47.220 --> 56:51.024
There's all this beautiful stuff.

56:51.124 --> 56:53.460
And, um...

56:53.560 --> 56:57.470
...  I got a little surprise for you in there.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.748
See you soon, buddy.

57:38.154 --> 57:40.154
- Oh, my God.

57:48.699 --> 57:50.699
Oh, my God.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.140
Oh, my God.

58:07.917 --> 58:10.212
It's time to call the cops.

58:13.957 --> 58:15.508
Hi. Hi.

58:15.608 --> 58:17.076
My name is Aaron Franklin.

58:17.176 --> 58:19.512
I'm calling to report
a violent domestic incident...

58:19.612 --> 58:21.612
...    and a stalker.

58:24.534 --> 58:27.187
Well, I don't know
if he's dangerous-dangerous,

58:27.287 --> 58:29.189
but he's really weird and super creepy...

58:29.289 --> 58:32.759
...   and I'm starting
to get scared for my safety.

58:32.859 --> 58:34.227
His name is Josef.

58:34.327 --> 58:35.228
Or at least I think it is.

58:35.328 --> 58:38.598
He lies a lot.

58:38.698 --> 58:41.534
No, I don't know--
I don't know his last name.

58:41.634 --> 58:43.036
No, I--I don't know where he lives.

58:43.136 --> 58:44.971
We met in a cabin he claimed was his,

58:45.071 --> 58:49.542
but I looked it up,
and it's just some rental.

58:49.642 --> 58:52.679
No, I have no way of finding him
or contacting him.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.915
Well, there must be something you can do.

58:56.015 --> 58:58.518
Can't you send someone over to
take fingerprints or something?

58:58.618 --> 59:01.254
He--he sent me a heart locket and a knife.

59:01.354 --> 59:04.924
You can use those.

59:05.024 --> 59:06.759
Well, I'm glad
you're taking this seriously.

59:06.859 --> 59:08.862
You guys have been entirely unhelpful.

59:08.962 --> 59:12.447
I'm sure I'll be
sleeping soundly tonight.

59:21.824 --> 59:28.030
So, I'm still having nightmares.

59:30.867 --> 59:36.122
It's, like, the same one
over and over again,

59:36.222 --> 59:39.007
just slightly different.

59:55.725 --> 59:58.211
Anyway, it's like we're--...

59:58.311 --> 59:59.812
... we're still in a hot tub,

59:59.912 --> 01:00:02.081
but the hot tub has,
like, these,

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:05.084
like, retractable spikes...

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.954
...and when you sit down on 'em,

01:00:08.054 --> 01:00:10.349
it's like they push up--...

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.143
...    Okay. Okay.

01:00:15.161 --> 01:00:16.062
Okay.

01:00:16.162 --> 01:00:17.297
Okay.

01:00:17.397 --> 01:00:18.765
Lights.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.200
Lights. Lights.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.300
Lights.
Lights.

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.396
Is anybody here?

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.736
Hello?

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.943
Josef?

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:55.182
Hello?

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:05.678
If there's anyone trespassing
on the premises,

01:01:05.778 --> 01:01:09.765
let it be known I have a knife.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.670
I'm--I'm not afraid to use it.

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:20.174
I--...

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.245
...    What was that?

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:06.354
Josef?

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:18.099
Hello?

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:30.044
Josef?

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.220
Is there anyone there?

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.383
God damn raccoons.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:36.956
The last couple nights
have been pretty normal...

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:42.361
...    until this.

01:04:42.461 --> 01:04:43.963
This is where I sleep.

01:04:44.063 --> 01:04:47.366
This is a broken screen in my window.

01:04:47.466 --> 01:04:49.885
This is not good.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:53.087
All right.

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:10.122
- Hey, Aaron.

01:05:10.222 --> 01:05:11.624
I get this, you know,

01:05:11.724 --> 01:05:13.392
you get a grave digging video in the mail.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.393
You throw it away.

01:05:14.493 --> 01:05:15.895
That's not a big deal.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.264
Um...

01:05:18.364 --> 01:05:21.133
...  This was harder for me to accept,

01:05:21.233 --> 01:05:24.437
and this hurt me
because I made this for you,

01:05:24.537 --> 01:05:27.640
and it was representative of--
of our friendship...

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:29.408
...and that bond that you and I
made together...

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:32.111
...   at that Heart Rock right over there.

01:05:32.211 --> 01:05:34.380
And you threw it away and--...

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.182
...   and when I found it in your trash can,

01:05:36.282 --> 01:05:40.186
I-I got my heart broken.

01:05:40.286 --> 01:05:42.321
And--and if I'm honest, it-- it sent me...

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:44.457
... into a little spiral and--...

01:05:44.557 --> 01:05:48.628
...and I had some inappropriate
and wrong thoughts...

01:05:48.728 --> 01:05:50.630
...   about what I wanted to do to you...

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:54.433
... and to myself, honestly.

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:55.935
And that was a red flag,

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.203
and it scared me,

01:05:57.303 --> 01:05:58.571
and I-I thought a lot about it...

01:05:58.671 --> 01:06:02.341
...and--and I realized something,

01:06:02.441 --> 01:06:06.412
and it's that you were right.

01:06:06.512 --> 01:06:09.015
You know, you were right
to throw that away,

01:06:09.115 --> 01:06:11.240
'cause we're not friends.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:14.620
Our relationship was based
on bullshit and lies that--...

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.689
... that I made up and--and--...

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:18.457
... and I'm sorry about that,

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.393
and--and I want to be done with it,

01:06:20.493 --> 01:06:22.528
and that's why I'm talking
to you today, okay?

01:06:22.628 --> 01:06:25.498
This is my attempt...

01:06:25.598 --> 01:06:30.136
...  to be real and truthful
and honest with you.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.471
And I'm not sure I'm capable of it, but--...

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:34.440
... but I'm gonna try, okay,

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.310
to explain to you the truth.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:45.117
And the truth is, I...

01:06:45.217 --> 01:06:47.217
...      am...

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.493
... The truth is, I don't know.

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:56.162
This is hard to talk about,
you know?

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.431
I-I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:06:58.531 --> 01:06:59.498
I've always done this.

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:00.599
I've--I've--...

01:07:00.699 --> 01:07:03.102
... I've been pretending my--...

01:07:03.202 --> 01:07:05.037
...   my whole life and--...

01:07:05.137 --> 01:07:06.672
...and then there was this phase
where I was like,

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:08.374
'Hey, I'll just be an actor,

01:07:08.474 --> 01:07:10.109
because that's what actors do,
pretend.'

01:07:10.209 --> 01:07:11.210
So I went headlong into that,

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:12.979
and then, you know,

01:07:13.079 --> 01:07:15.014
it did nothing for me
because it wasn't real.

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.449
Like, it--I could only get off on it...

01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:18.250
...   unless it was real,

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.419
and so I saw doctors,
and some of them thought,

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:22.221
'Hey,' you know, 'He's crazy,'

01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:23.289
and some thought not,

01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:24.390
and there were medications,

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:27.275
but none of that helped me.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:35.267
And it's led me to a terrible place.

01:07:35.367 --> 01:07:37.703
I don't have any friends.

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:39.605
I've burned every bridge.

01:07:39.705 --> 01:07:42.408
My sisters.
My parents.

01:07:42.508 --> 01:07:45.778
I have nothing,
and I need somebody to talk to.

01:07:45.878 --> 01:07:48.547
And I'm hoping
that your kindness is huge...

01:07:48.647 --> 01:07:50.483
...  and that, even though
I've burned that bridge...

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:53.319
...  and you have no reason
to trust me at all,

01:07:53.419 --> 01:07:59.258
that you will give me a chance
to talk to you...

01:07:59.358 --> 01:08:03.062
...and at the very least explain
myself to you,

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.264
and if you never want to
see me again, that's fine.

01:08:05.364 --> 01:08:06.699
At least we'll have closure.

01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:10.236
But I'm gonna be here.

01:08:10.336 --> 01:08:11.370
At Lake Gregory.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:13.470
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:15.241
And it's a public place.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.776
It's wide open.

01:08:16.876 --> 01:08:19.178
It's completely safe,
and I promise you,

01:08:19.278 --> 01:08:22.678
you don't have
to be afraid of me at all.

01:08:22.715 --> 01:08:27.653
I just want a chance
to show you who I really am...

01:08:27.752 --> 01:08:28.654
...  and the truth of me,

01:08:28.754 --> 01:08:32.158
because the truth is,

01:08:32.258 --> 01:08:34.542
I am a lonely person.

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:38.813
And I'm a sad person.

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:43.435
And I really need a friend.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:46.850
And you're the only chance that I have.

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:06.330
- What the hell
am I supposed to do with this?

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.885
Look at him.

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.223
He's so sad.

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:31.584
All right, Josef.

01:09:31.684 --> 01:09:33.486
I'm here.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.287
You got me.

01:09:35.386 --> 01:09:37.689
But know that I'm filming this,

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:41.189
and my phone is set to
speed dial to 911.

01:12:26.942 --> 01:12:28.982
It keeps getting better.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.665
I remember the first time
I watched this, Aaron,

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.633
and I thought to myself,

01:12:34.733 --> 01:12:37.603
'Okay, it was smart that you filmed it,

01:12:37.703 --> 01:12:39.438
'and it was smart
that you put your phone...

01:12:39.538 --> 01:12:42.741
...on speed dial for the cops.'

01:12:42.841 --> 01:12:46.512
But why didn't you at least
look behind you?

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:51.457
I mean, it just seemed dumb
that you would just sit there.

01:12:53.502 --> 01:12:57.412
And then I realized
why you didn't turn around.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:03.996
It's because you're the greatest
person that's ever lived, Aaron.

01:13:04.096 --> 01:13:07.866
No matter what I did to you,

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:12.104
you believed I was good...

01:13:12.204 --> 01:13:15.089
...and I would do you no harm.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.912
And that is why...

01:13:20.012 --> 01:13:23.782
... I will always love you.

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:28.120
And why you'll always be my favorite...

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:30.220
...    of them all.

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.715
Mm-hmm.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:55.147
Okay.

01:13:55.247 --> 01:13:59.051
Everything's okay.

01:13:59.151 --> 01:14:02.654
Not a care in the world.

01:14:02.754 --> 01:14:05.006
It's all over.

01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:20.973
Hello?

01:14:21.073 --> 01:14:23.073
Yes, this is Bill.

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.083
The job is pretty simple,
really.

01:14:31.183 --> 01:14:32.684
All you need is a video camera,

01:14:32.784 --> 01:14:37.523
yourself,
and eight hours of your time.

01:14:37.623 --> 01:14:40.626
Mm-hmm.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:41.994
Great.
Great.

01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:45.964
Well, I look forward to meeting you.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.599
Okay.

01:14:47.699 --> 01:14:50.589
All right,
see you tomorrow, buddy.
