11:52.129 --> 11:53.414
This is your salvation.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.253
You have a curse.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.588
—|'m here to free you.
—Let me go.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.175
Trust me.
It's best for everybody.

12:00.304 --> 12:03.967
[Screaming]

12:13.650 --> 12:14.935
We got to go.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.480
Nathan, what are you doing?

12:18.822 --> 12:21.985
You should really
put some clothes on.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.739
l'm late for class.
I forgot I even signed up for it.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.612
I didn't study.
Now we have a test.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.917
Huh?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.971
I'm not even in this class.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.771
I'm sick and tired of your excuses,
Mr. Wuornos.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.697
Give me an answer.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.696
I don't even know the question.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.416
Uh...

13:15.545 --> 13:16.250
Time's up!

13:16.380 --> 13:18.996
No, uh, I...

13:19.132 --> 13:20.247
Just let me think.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.291
Ow!

13:23.387 --> 13:24.251
You're too late.

13:24.388 --> 13:27.846
Boys like you need to get punished,
or you'll never learn.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.465
Stand up.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.609
Mm—hmm.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.775
This will be a lesson
you'll never forget.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.703
[Doorbell rings]

13:52.833 --> 13:54.289
[Knock at door]

13:54.418 --> 13:56.124
AUDREY: Nathan?

13:56.253 --> 13:57.413
Hey, if you're there,
wake up, all right?

13:57.546 --> 13:59.628
You can't fall asleep.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.130
I'm gonna need a minute.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.171
Okay, well, hurry up.
We need to get to the morgue.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.552
Okay, so Duke dreams
about being injured.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.427
When he wakes up,
his injury has still stayed with him.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.224
So I'm thinking that Freddie,

14:16.356 --> 14:20.565
who apparently drinks and enjoys
watching bear attack TV,

14:20.694 --> 14:23.401
he dreams about being mauled
and then is killed.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.312
Uh, mm—hmm.

14:25.449 --> 14:28.907
I'd say that's a pretty solid theory.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.402
—Did that happen last night?
—Mm—hmm.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.039
—Were you dreaming?
—Mm—hmm.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.827
SchooL

14:38.879 --> 14:40.494
All right, are you two ready?

14:40.630 --> 14:42.666
Yes.

14:42.799 --> 14:46.257
Behind door number one,
male victim in his 40s,

14:46.386 --> 14:50.379
swollen from what would appear
to be multiple bee stings.

14:50.515 --> 14:53.882
Wife said he was allergic to bees,
had a bit of a phobia about it.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.010
And like
our drunkly—departed Freddie,

14:56.146 --> 14:58.979
this victim was venom—free
and stinger—free,

14:59.107 --> 15:02.349
yet he swelled up like he was
in anaphylactic shock.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.693
It gets worse.
Over here.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.692
Next vic——

15:07.824 --> 15:11.737
young male in his 20s,
died of blood loss,

15:11.870 --> 15:14.031
found on his couch
with all his teeth on the floor.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.529
Remember to floss, people.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.701
Losing your teeth ——
I've had that dream.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.041
Oh, yeah. The one where
they all plop out, roots and all?

15:20.170 --> 15:22.286
—M m—hmm.
—Yeah, it's gross.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.880
All right, last but not least,
victim number one.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.715
Didn't we already have number one?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.380
Bingo. You're listening.

15:29.513 --> 15:30.719
She gets a new number

15:30.847 --> 15:32.712
because this one
is not like the others ——

15:32.849 --> 15:34.965
young, female,
multiple stab wounds.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.388
lt's Sonia Winston.
I know her.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.886
She's in The Guard.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.137
How's she different?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.138
Well, I found this
in her breastbone.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.108
My best guess ——
It's a knife tip.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.148
Wait. That's physical evidence.
So that means that ——

15:47.280 --> 15:51.740
She didn't die in a dream.
She was murdered.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.074
Where was she found?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.238
In an alley near the marina.

15:54.371 --> 15:57.363
Yet the scene indicates
that she wasn't killed there.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.329
She was left out in the open.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.744
Looks like the killer got spooked
and dumped the body.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.913
So someone panicked,
dumped the body.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.081
Yep. All right.

16:04.214 --> 16:07.251
Well, let me know
when the next one rolls in.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.296
And I would like to at least be
on the back nine.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.348
Let me follow up on this.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.013
You and Lexie work
the dream trouble.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.807
All right.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.019
You're back.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.613
Did you get my message
about not going to sleep?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.277
Yeah, thanks.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.526
This town, right?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.122
What are you doing?

16:41.251 --> 16:44.994
|, uh —— I've been gutting a fish.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.121
—You went fishing?
—Yeah. You said not to sleep.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.294
So I thought, you know,
maybe I'd go out one last time.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.510
I thought we might have it
for dinner.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.424
Hmm?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.766
Right.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.854
[Sighing]
Sounds good.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.475
Did you hear that the cops
are looking for Jordan?

17:08.612 --> 17:10.944
She left town.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.155
No, she's missing.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.491
—People are worried.
—She's a complicated woman.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.702
She's probably halfway
to Costa Rica by now.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.742
I think this whole
"no sleeping" thing

17:21.875 --> 17:24.036
has made you a little...edgy.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.705
[Sighs]

17:32.761 --> 17:35.594
You chipped a knife
gutting a fish?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.587
Clumsy.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.923
I'm gonna take a shower.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.597
Then I'm gonna start packing up.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.244
None of these fish are gutted.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.468
—That's your background check?
—Mm—hmm.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.928
Very impressive.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.890
I do have to warn you,
it's boring ——

the most Girl Scout cookies

18:25.730 --> 18:26.981

18:27.107 --> 18:30.065
But there was one thing
that I couldn't find ——

18:30.193 --> 18:31.729
my birth parents.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.904
The records were sealed.
Finding them was impossible.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.648
And it's not the first time
I've tried.

18:39.369 --> 18:42.907
So, if you don't want to hire me,
| get it.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.620
Oh, you've got the job.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.245
—Rea|ly?
—Yeah.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.869
Oh, my God, that's amazing.
When do | start?

18:51.006 --> 18:52.416
Um...

18:53.383 --> 18:56.125
—Tomorrow.
—Perfect.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.751
Good.

18:59.723 --> 19:00.633
Thank you.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.926
Thank you.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.778
Double red—eyes—straight,
no chasers.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.113
I wrote down everything
like you asked me to.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.322
Thank you.

19:20.994 --> 19:22.734
I made sure yours was lukewarm.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.452
Thanks.

19:24.581 --> 19:26.446
We can't find any connection
between these victims.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.789
So, since both you and Nathan

19:27.917 --> 19:29.748
are the only two people
that are still alive

19:29.878 --> 19:31.869
that have been affected
by this dream trouble ——

19:32.005 --> 19:34.712
So, if we can compare what you guys
did in the last 48 hours

19:34.841 --> 19:36.456
and see if you have anything
in common,

19:36.593 --> 19:38.629
then we can find
our troubled person.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.003
Okay, so you woke up.

19:41.139 --> 19:44.051
You had one of Wade's
breakfast vegan sausages.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.891
You checked your horoscope
in the Haven Hera/d.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.387
—|'m a Gemini. Aquarius rising.
—That's fascinating.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.899
It's actually
a really interesting transit.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.107
—Hmm. Mm—hmm.
—Wait a second.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.145
When we picked up Freddie,

19:55.278 --> 19:57.644
wasn't he passed out
on a stack of Haven Heralds?

19:57.781 --> 19:59.271
Yeah.

19:59.407 --> 20:03.901
And the bee—sting guy, I think
he had a Hera/d on his end table.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.494
Yep, there was a Hera/d
at every incident.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.660
| read the Herald
at the station yesterday.

but...| knew it.

for sure, okay?

20:17.967 --> 20:19.582
We just know
the paper's connected.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.674
What?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.590
I got the paper off Dwight's desk.

20:22.722 --> 20:23.928
So, if I was affected...

20:24.057 --> 20:25.342
It means Dwight could be, too.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.888
Okay, we got to make sure
he doesn't fall asleep.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.881
Hey, Wade.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.597
The wound just missed
his subclavian artery.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.761
He lost some blood,

21:50.894 --> 21:53.761
but I expect him
to regain consciousness soon.

21:53.897 --> 21:57.810
Doc, uh, was there a request
for the...?

21:57.942 --> 21:59.478
The sedatives will insure
he won't dream.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.226
Okay.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.980
We got to find Vince and Dave.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.359

about the newspapers.

Hey. Uh...

23:15.353 --> 23:18.845
Yeah. He's been around a lot lately,
always brings tons of gear.

23:18.982 --> 23:21.439
Yeah, he's been pulling in
a bunch of big striped bass.

23:21.568 --> 23:26.062
Is there any, uh, chance that the boat
he's been renting has a GPS?

23:26.197 --> 23:27.653
Sure would love
to find his fishing spot.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.740
Sure. He usually takes out
that one over there.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.075
Check out the history
on the chartplotter.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.535
You'll be set.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.780
All right, thanks.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.625
You think we could, uh,
keep this off the books?

I can assure you we are not
the source of this trouble.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.707
And the people we use
to print the Herald

25:03.836 --> 25:05.701
have never put out
a troubled paper.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.045
Is there anything different
about this issue ——

25:08.174 --> 25:09.289
new ink, paper pulp?

25:09.425 --> 25:11.882
No, no, we've done it
the same way for years.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.172
Could there be a photo in there
that's troubled?

25:14.305 --> 25:18.469
Oh, good.
You're catching on quick, Lexie.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.809
Oh, well, it's Nathan's brilliant
investigative mind.

It just must be rubbing off on me.

25:24.941 --> 25:29.230
Maybe, uh,
it's who's delivering the paper.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.818
Who's on the route map?

25:30.947 --> 25:33.484
Haven P.D., The Gull.

25:33.616 --> 25:37.905

the afternoon edition

25:48.965 --> 25:50.330

26:01.519 --> 26:03.680
Sure, I know about the troubles.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.804
I mean, I'm troubled.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.396
Since when is that a crime?

26:07.525 --> 26:08.605
It's not.

26:08.735 --> 26:12.273
We just think that you might have
some kind of a dream curse.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.691
Yeah. I'm aware.

in our dreams ——

physically, I mean ——

26:21.748 --> 26:23.864
happens to us in real life.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.161
Well, it's not just you anymore.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.957

No, that's impossible.

for generations.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.881

26:38.014 --> 26:39.379
Well, it has now.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.136
but everyone that you've been
in contact with

26:47.273 --> 26:49.855
is getting injured in their dreams.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.565
How can we stop it?

26:51.694 --> 26:53.901
If this trouble of yours
is spreading like the flu,

26:54.030 --> 26:55.770
then maybe if we cure you ——

26:55.907 --> 26:58.148
We can stop the curse
for everyone.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.280
It's worth a try.

27:02.413 --> 27:05.826
We just need to figure out how.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.333
It's part of family lore.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.669
There's a way. It's just...

27:11.798 --> 27:15.006
almost everyone who's tried it
has died.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.091
It's called lucid dreaming.

27:21.224 --> 27:23.761
You're asleep, but you're aware.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.599
You can keep yourself safe.

27:25.728 --> 27:30.017
My, um —— my mother taught me
that in my dreams

27:30.149 --> 27:32.105
to never go into the dark places.

27:32.235 --> 27:33.941
The dark places?

27:34.070 --> 27:37.312
My relatives who died ——
that's where they went.

27:37.448 --> 27:39.109
Hmm.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.779
Stan and Rebecca
are blasting downtown Haven

27:41.911 --> 27:44.778
with sirens, air horns,
keeping everyone awake.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.621
The only place to get
to sleep tonight is here.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.617
All right, Carrie, let's do this.

27:50.753 --> 27:51.959
What's next?

27:52.088 --> 27:53.544
The legend in my family

27:53.673 --> 27:57.541
is that our worst fears
are in those dark places.

27:57.677 --> 28:01.716
And if we can confront them
and stop being afraid of them,

28:01.848 --> 28:03.634
then our troubles stop.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.973
My great—aunt did it.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.387
But the others...

28:07.520 --> 28:09.806
All right,
so what will yours be?

28:09.939 --> 28:11.304
What will you see?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.146
Not what...

28:13.276 --> 28:14.482
Who.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.942
Two days ago,
on the far side of my route,

28:17.071 --> 28:18.481
I got mugged by a couple of guys.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.401
They took all my cash,
knocked me out,

28:21.534 --> 28:22.899
left me on the side of the road.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.650
Why didn't you tell the police?

28:24.787 --> 28:26.652
They said if I did that
they would come back and kill me.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.495
I believed them.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.909
| just wanted to forget about it.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.579
In my dream, it'll —— it'll be them.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.327
I know it.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.249
Are you sure you want to do this?

28:36.382 --> 28:38.964
I'm not gonna let
any more people die.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.840
Okay.

28:43.139 --> 28:45.676
Hey...

28:45.808 --> 28:47.014
I'll be right here.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.384
I'll be sitting right beside you,
all right?

28:49.520 --> 28:51.476
Okay.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.477
I'm ready.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.199
Thanks for the ride, man.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.824
I think you should find
another ride home.

29:13.836 --> 29:16.327
Get out of here...

29:16.464 --> 29:17.203
Now!

29:19.717 --> 29:22.208
—What the hell was that?
—I know, Wade.

29:22.345 --> 29:23.710
I know everything.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.052
What are you talking about?

29:25.181 --> 29:27.217
I saw your dumping ground.

29:27.350 --> 29:31.514
I saw the bodies ——
Jordan's body.

29:33.022 --> 29:34.432
They were troubled.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.226
l was helping them...

29:36.359 --> 29:38.566
saving them and their families.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.525
That's why we have this gift.

29:41.447 --> 29:42.732
This power.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.698
It isn't a power.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.078
It's a curse.

29:48.204 --> 29:50.069
This is our trouble.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.912
We're not like the others.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.248
This thing turned you into a killer.

29:54.377 --> 29:57.039
If that's not a curse,
then I don't know what is!

29:57.171 --> 30:00.083
You're not gonna...
turn me in, are you?

30:00.216 --> 30:02.298
I mean, I know you're friends
with the cops and all,

30:02.426 --> 30:04.587
but we're brothers.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.178
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.143
You killed all those people, Wade.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.307
That's on me, too, now.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.931
I made Audrey and Nathan
a promise.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.854
Audrey and Nathan...

30:20.987 --> 30:23.273
Yeah.

30:23.406 --> 30:26.364
We both got secrets
we don't want getting out.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.279
I mean, I could tell everyone
that Lexie is Audrey

30:29.412 --> 30:31.152
and that you knew all along.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.665
The Guard will come for you.
You want that?

30:33.791 --> 30:35.702
The Guard will come
for both of us.

30:35.835 --> 30:40.499
Yeah, and they'll
make Audrey kill Nathan.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.256
Fine.

31:24.508 --> 31:27.875
It's okay, Carrie.
You're not alone, all right?

31:28.012 --> 31:31.800
I'm right here.
Don't be afraid.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.183
[Branches cracking]

31:36.395 --> 31:38.431
[Branches cracking]

31:38.564 --> 31:40.771
Who's there?

31:43.319 --> 31:44.775
Someone's here.

31:44.904 --> 31:48.772
Okay, Carrie, listen to me.
Don't be afraid.

32:00.336 --> 32:01.496
[Gasps]

32:13.432 --> 32:15.047
l'm trapped!

32:15.184 --> 32:16.924
[Screams]

32:23.234 --> 32:26.226
It's okay, Carrie.
You're not alone, all right?

32:26.362 --> 32:28.068
I'm right here.

32:28.197 --> 32:30.404
Stop it.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.239
Please.

32:34.370 --> 32:35.280
Oh.

32:35.412 --> 32:36.913
Okay, Carrie.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.030
Carrie?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.407
Duke said something
about a bunch of people

32:41.544 --> 32:42.533
dying in their sleep.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.251
What's the cover story?

32:44.380 --> 32:48.248
We weren't sure we wanted
to share this with you, but...

32:48.384 --> 32:50.500
we found something
in your background check.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.127
We thought maybe
you could clear it up for us.

32:54.682 --> 32:57.924
The man who arranged
your adoption.

32:59.687 --> 33:00.927
Who is he?

33:01.063 --> 33:03.270
Someone very important in Haven.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.264
He brought Audrey to us.

33:05.401 --> 33:09.269
He was supposed to take her away,
but he was killed.

33:09.405 --> 33:11.737
His name is Agent Howard.

33:11.866 --> 33:14.357
Howard...

33:14.493 --> 33:17.951
But that was one of the voices
I heard in the barn.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.321
Why would he have arranged
my adoption?

33:20.457 --> 33:23.540
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.710
Stop, please.

33:34.263 --> 33:36.675
Carrie?
Can you hear me?

33:37.766 --> 33:39.472
—Carrie?
—[ Groans]

33:39.602 --> 33:42.639
Don't be afraid,
and fight back.

33:43.397 --> 33:46.309
—I can't.
—Yes, you can.

33:46.442 --> 33:48.182
You can.
You can do this.

33:50.321 --> 33:52.277
I'm not afraid of the dark.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.364
I'm not afraid of the dark.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.785
And I'm not afraid of you.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.121
[Gasps]

34:09.131 --> 34:10.337
I did it.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.669
Oh.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.508
It's okay. It's okay.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.299
We'll get that checked out,
all right?

34:17.431 --> 34:19.513
You did great.

34:19.642 --> 34:22.008
You did great.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.725
[Grunts softly]

34:23.854 --> 34:27.062
Got to stay after class.

34:27.191 --> 34:28.772
[Chuckles]

34:28.901 --> 34:30.437
That looks like
a pretty good dream.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.480
It'd be a shame to wake him up.

34:34.490 --> 34:35.821
[Chuckles]

34:38.118 --> 34:39.858
Duke? You here?

34:39.995 --> 34:41.701
I've been up all night
with Vince and Dave.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.865
You wouldn't believe what ——

34:42.998 --> 34:44.158
[Pounding on door]

34:44.291 --> 34:46.373
—Duke?
—Jennifer?

34:46.502 --> 34:48.709
l, uh, managed
to lock myself in here.

34:48.837 --> 34:51.579
—Help me out?
—Yeah, of course.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.548
Hey.

35:02.685 --> 35:04.141
Oh, you don't look so hot.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.885
Why don't I get you
a glass of water?

35:06.021 --> 35:07.727
Oh, no, stay here.
I need you.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.642
—What are you doing?
—Listen to me.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.061
—I need a taste.
—No, please, don't.

35:12.194 --> 35:15.231
| just need a taste.
Move, and I'll kill you.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.356
[Whimpering]

35:21.662 --> 35:23.243
I need more.

35:23.372 --> 35:24.703
Wade? No!

35:25.582 --> 35:26.867
Wade!

35:31.630 --> 35:33.336
You okay?
Yeah. You okay?

35:33.465 --> 35:36.127
Yeah.
Stay right here.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.304
Out of my way, Duke.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.308
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

35:47.563 --> 35:50.771
—You have to control this.
—I don't think I can.

35:52.735 --> 35:54.942
Wade, please...

35:55.070 --> 35:57.152
Don't make me do it.

35:57.281 --> 35:59.818
I will kill you if I have to.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.986
I know.

36:02.119 --> 36:04.861
—Wade!
—Oh, my God!

36:33.692 --> 36:37.310
The doctor said Dwight
was discharged an hour ago.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.731
Yeah, well,
he was pretty anxious

36:38.864 --> 36:40.570
to get back to work
on that stabbing case.

36:40.699 --> 36:44.658
Attention, visiting hours
end in five minutes.

36:44.787 --> 36:48.450
Visiting hours end in five minutes.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.661
Hey, Carrie.
How you holding up?

36:51.794 --> 36:54.786
They're keeping me for observation,
but I'll be fine.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.162
Oh, good.

36:56.298 --> 36:58.835
| just wanted to say thank you.

36:59.802 --> 37:02.214
I'm just so sorry I caused all this.

37:02.346 --> 37:03.882
No, you did great.

37:04.014 --> 37:06.721
Just, um, get some rest.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.681
What happened?
Where did you get that?

37:08.811 --> 37:12.554
—The handprint.
—What?

37:13.399 --> 37:15.185
What?
There's nothing there.

37:15.317 --> 37:16.932
You guys don't see that?

37:17.069 --> 37:19.526
There's a ——
There's a handprint there.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.366
Did that happen to you
in your nightmare?

37:23.492 --> 37:24.982
No.

37:25.119 --> 37:27.701
Oh, uh, when l was mugged,
the last thing I remember

37:27.830 --> 37:30.367
was, like, a weird sensation
back there.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.364
And then I passed out.

37:32.501 --> 37:33.832
What —— what does it mean?

37:33.961 --> 37:37.169
We're gonna need you to ID.
the men who attacked you.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.878
We need you now.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.713
—More tests.
—Go ahead.

37:49.977 --> 37:51.057
What was that?

37:51.186 --> 37:53.438
Is that a mark that only I can see?

37:53.564 --> 37:56.897
Maybe that's why
her trouble mutated

37:57.025 --> 37:59.061
or spread to other people.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.479
That is not how the troubles work.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.775
Yeah,butu
what if it's all changing?

38:26.722 --> 38:28.713
Hey.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.887
You had no choice.
He wanted it to end this way.

38:35.856 --> 38:38.723
I could tell when he came at me,
he was going to kill me.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.601
You saved my life.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.908
I know.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.347
Duke”.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.932
Your trouble...

39:14.061 --> 39:16.268
It's gone.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.646
No one can know about any of this.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.141
ButAudrey and Nathan
will help you. They'll understand.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.268
Will they?

39:25.113 --> 39:29.322
I told them to trust me
and look what happened.

39:29.451 --> 39:31.157
Look what I did.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.822
You're not like your brother, Duke.

39:32.955 --> 39:35.367
Then why did you flinch
when I touched you?

39:39.920 --> 39:43.003
I won't say anything.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.837
You have my word.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.510
I thought you were just
gonna drop me off.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.880
Yeah, well, we need to talk.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.100
Listen, that handprint you saw ——
What if you're right?

39:57.229 --> 40:00.141
What if this is something new,
something dangerous?

40:00.274 --> 40:01.684
We have to do something.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.399
No, I'm going to kill you,
Nathan, all right?

40:04.528 --> 40:05.938
And Lexie is not going anywhere.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.311
So just drop it.

40:07.447 --> 40:09.358
I can't. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.027
Nathan, what's your problem?

40:11.159 --> 40:12.865
Is this really about Lexie?

40:12.995 --> 40:15.657
'Cause you didn't have a problem
with Sarah.

40:15.831 --> 40:17.537
Oh, this is about Sarah now?

40:17.666 --> 40:20.874
She's a part of me, too...

40:21.003 --> 40:23.710
a part that apparently
you're pretty familiar with.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.208
I'm not gonna apologize
for what happened.

40:29.344 --> 40:32.381
You have no idea
how hard this has been for me.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.720
Foryou?

40:33.849 --> 40:38.343
At least you have the luxury
of being one person.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.810
—At least you know who you are.
—We|l, l ——

40:40.939 --> 40:41.803
You know what you are.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.931
I want to know what we are!

40:44.943 --> 40:47.525
Too much has happened, Nathan.

40:48.530 --> 40:52.523
We can't be Audrey and Nathan,
not anymore.

40:54.745 --> 40:59.079
We work together.
That's it.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.869
Right.
I'll see you at work.

41:16.767 --> 41:19.804
[Door opens]

41:27.903 --> 41:31.111
I don't care who you are
or what you are.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.069
I love you.
