WEBVTT

00:27.613 --> 00:31.200
MAN: Stop the clock. Well?
MAN 2:
Two minutes, 25 seconds.

00:31.284 --> 00:33.244
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

00:33.327 --> 00:35.079
-Damn.
-Sorry.

00:37.248 --> 00:40.376
I've done it in 2:23
and that was in
Father's old Rover.

00:40.460 --> 00:42.211
Thought these places
were all hotels now.

00:42.295 --> 00:44.547
Some have managed to hang on.
Death duties did for me.

00:44.630 --> 00:47.508
We were neighbours,
separated by
a few thousand acres,

00:47.592 --> 00:49.469
but this used to
be my second home.

00:49.552 --> 00:52.013
-Hi, I'm Lexie.
-Hi, we're expected.

00:52.096 --> 00:55.850
Still, Fulham to Glenbogle
in eight hours. Not bad.

00:55.933 --> 00:57.852
I'll let the laird
know you're here, then.

01:36.641 --> 01:38.476
(LAUGHING)

01:41.938 --> 01:43.272
Ah, yes.

01:48.903 --> 01:51.989
Here. This is the spot.

01:53.199 --> 01:54.909
(WHISTLING)

01:56.494 --> 01:58.955
(ECHOING)

02:03.292 --> 02:05.420
(ECHOING)

02:12.677 --> 02:14.137
Woody Woodpecker.

02:15.722 --> 02:19.933
Yeah, the bags are in
the back. No joyriding.

02:22.311 --> 02:25.314
-David?
-Hello!

02:25.398 --> 02:27.483
Your secret whistle.

02:27.567 --> 02:28.985
Mine and Jamie's.

02:29.068 --> 02:32.113
-And Archie's.
-Yes, of course, and Archie's.

02:32.196 --> 02:35.908
Let me look at you.
You haven't changed at all.

02:35.992 --> 02:37.702
You're still as
lovely as ever.

02:37.785 --> 02:40.038
-Always the charmer.
-Good to be back, Molly.

02:40.121 --> 02:42.957
-This is my good
friend Jonathan.
-How do you do?

02:43.041 --> 02:45.835
Welcome to Glenbogle.
We were expecting you to...

02:45.918 --> 02:47.920
Sarah, I know. Rush job.
She couldn't make it.

02:48.004 --> 02:50.006
I thought you wouldn't mind
if I brought Jonathan instead.

02:50.089 --> 02:52.842
Not at all. Does Archie
know that you're here?

02:52.925 --> 02:55.011
Lexie, is that her name?
I think she's...

02:55.094 --> 02:58.097
So, you've met
Archie's adorable wife.

02:58.181 --> 03:02.310
Oh, my God! Lexie, of course.
I thought she worked here.

03:02.393 --> 03:04.729
She does. We all do!

03:04.812 --> 03:06.564
Well, if you'll excuse me,

03:06.647 --> 03:08.983
I'm expecting Kilwillie.
You remember Lord Kilwillie,
don't you?

03:09.067 --> 03:12.403
Yes. I think we
passed him on the drive.

03:34.759 --> 03:38.471
Once you're quite decent,
we can go for that walk
you suggested.

03:43.184 --> 03:45.728
I bet you no one's
ever mistaken Molly
for the housekeeper.

03:45.812 --> 03:47.480
You're being oversensitive.

03:50.191 --> 03:53.319
-Lexie, please.
-Not until you give me a kiss.

03:53.403 --> 03:55.697
-They're waiting.
-So am I.

03:56.989 --> 03:58.700
Do you not want to kiss me?

04:06.708 --> 04:08.418
Now away and play
with your friends.

04:08.501 --> 04:10.378
-Archie!
-David!

04:10.461 --> 04:12.880
Archie, you old dog.

04:12.964 --> 04:16.259
I should have been here.
What about the stag do?

04:16.341 --> 04:19.220
He promised me I'd be
best man. I promised him
a night to remember.

04:19.303 --> 04:21.764
Well,
it was all a bit of a rush.
Anyway, you're here now.

04:21.848 --> 04:25.226
So, this is who you wanted me
to meet. I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

04:26.227 --> 04:27.812
Sarah couldn't make it?

04:27.895 --> 04:29.772
Called away on business,
you know how it is.
Everything's so

04:29.856 --> 04:31.315
bloody last-minute.

04:31.399 --> 04:34.402
The bush fires, Archie.
They're all
putting out bush fires.

04:34.485 --> 04:36.446
Look,
I'm so sorry about earlier.

04:36.529 --> 04:38.197
You must think me
impossibly rude.

04:38.281 --> 04:40.700
Please put it down to car lag.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.952
Archie,
you've certainly moved on.

04:43.036 --> 04:46.789
It's very good meet you,
Lexie MacDonald.

04:46.873 --> 04:50.084
Now, look,
I've brought an old friend
along with me, Jonathan Pell.

04:50.167 --> 04:53.504
He's an old
school friend of mine.
I think Molly approves.

04:53.588 --> 04:55.882
But he's a bit of a wimp.
He faints at the sight of mud.

04:55.965 --> 04:58.384
But he's sound,
sound as they come.

04:58.468 --> 05:02.013
Now, Archie, a drink I think,
then football.
Come on.

05:05.516 --> 05:09.270
It's not the easiest
thing for a chap to admit.

05:10.521 --> 05:13.483
But it is pressing,
very pressing.

05:14.817 --> 05:17.195
Has been for
sometime actually.

05:18.071 --> 05:19.864
Quite sometime.

05:22.533 --> 05:27.497
-Isn't this glorious?
-Yes, yes, glorious.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.625
(HESITATING) You see,
what I'm trying to say is,

05:30.708 --> 05:33.086
you do know I'm very
fond of you, Molly.

05:33.169 --> 05:38.466
Of course you are, Kilwillie.
You were so fond of Hector.

05:38.549 --> 05:42.345
Well...
I'm not sure fond is the word
I was looking for exactly.

05:42.428 --> 05:44.764
Let's go and see the wolves,
shall we?

05:44.847 --> 05:48.309
Ah! Golly! How nice.

05:48.393 --> 05:51.145
Oh, yes. How nice.

05:55.775 --> 05:58.069
DAVID: Ready, Jonathan?

06:01.489 --> 06:03.156
Come on, Jonathan.

06:06.119 --> 06:09.622
-The MacDonalds
cream the Frasers.
-That won't last.

06:09.706 --> 06:13.084
Oh, God,
Archie, it's good to be back.
Just like the old days.

06:13.167 --> 06:17.130
-Well, not quite.
-No.

06:17.213 --> 06:19.424
You and Jamie always
used to make me keep goal.

06:19.507 --> 06:22.176
It's mine. It's mine!

06:22.260 --> 06:25.722
-Mine! Mine.
-He's there...

06:25.805 --> 06:29.058
-Oh, for God's sake,
it's only a game.
-Game?

06:32.979 --> 06:38.026
Glenbogle's
first native wolves.
Archie must be pleased.

06:38.109 --> 06:40.361
They came out of
the nursery cave this morning.

06:40.445 --> 06:43.072
MOLLY: Why isn't that one
playing with the others?

06:43.156 --> 06:45.658
They won't accept it.
It's the runt.

06:45.742 --> 06:47.618
What will happen to it?

06:47.702 --> 06:51.831
-They'll kill it.
-It's nature, my dear.
Red in tooth and claw.

06:51.914 --> 06:54.375
Oh! That's awful.

06:54.459 --> 06:57.712
Yes, that's frightful.
Can't you do
something about it, Golly?

06:57.795 --> 06:59.714
We must not
interfere with nature.

06:59.797 --> 07:01.591
Poor little thing.

07:06.346 --> 07:08.348
(CALLING)

07:08.431 --> 07:11.225
-Are you all right, Kilwillie?
-What?

07:11.309 --> 07:14.562
-I think you're
sickening for something.
-Really?

07:14.645 --> 07:17.732
Golly will drive us back.
I'm feeling
rather tired myself.

07:17.815 --> 07:20.985
And the sooner we get
you home, the better,
judging by the look of you.

07:21.069 --> 07:23.071
-But, Molly...
-I insist.

07:29.535 --> 07:31.204
ARCHIE: Absolutely not.

07:31.287 --> 07:33.581
We can't have wild animals
running around the house.

07:33.664 --> 07:36.459
So you're prepared to condemn
the poor little
creature to death?

07:36.542 --> 07:39.712
Mother,
it is not a little creature.
It is a small wolf.

07:39.796 --> 07:42.215
Yes,
dear, I'm sure you're right.

07:50.056 --> 07:51.974
That looks nice.

07:52.058 --> 07:54.852
Canard a la Glenbogle.
It's French.

07:56.145 --> 07:59.023
Are you reading this, Irene?

07:59.107 --> 08:01.734
Oh, yeah,
I'm about halfway through.

08:01.818 --> 08:03.778
So you're interested
in archaeology, then?

08:03.861 --> 08:06.280
-Yes.
-Yeah, me, too.

08:06.364 --> 08:08.616
Really?

08:08.700 --> 08:11.619
There's a lot of
history buried on this estate.

08:11.703 --> 08:14.372
So, Golly, what do you
think of Archie's friend?

08:14.455 --> 08:18.793
-Can you believe it?
He told me not to joyride.
-Quite right.

08:18.876 --> 08:22.130
Listen, there's
the remains of an old dig
that you might like to see.

08:22.213 --> 08:24.799
Not too far from here. There.

08:24.882 --> 08:26.801
Ah, a burial site.

08:26.884 --> 08:30.346
Yep. So, tomorrow?

08:30.430 --> 08:34.058
-Okay,
I'll read up on it tonight.
-Good.

08:39.105 --> 08:42.984
Can I come to
the burial thingy?

08:43.067 --> 08:45.069
Don't tempt me, Duncan.

08:47.321 --> 08:50.158
DAVID: Come on, Archie!

08:50.241 --> 08:53.411
You might not
have had a stag party
before the wedding, Archie,

08:53.494 --> 08:56.372
but you're certainly
gonna have one now.

08:56.456 --> 08:58.166
-Stop the clock!
-Yes!

08:59.292 --> 09:01.334
Not bad.

09:01.419 --> 09:05.131
Archie and Lexie, may
they live happily ever after.

09:05.214 --> 09:07.050
Hadn't we better
wait for Lexie?

09:07.133 --> 09:10.720
-It's a woman's prerogative
to be late, Jonathan.
-Or not turn up.

09:13.389 --> 09:16.517
-So,
you were at college with...
-Archie and Lexie.

09:16.601 --> 09:17.935
Absent friends.

09:32.408 --> 09:34.660
(WHIMPERING)

09:44.045 --> 09:45.922
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

09:54.639 --> 09:56.933
Am I doing this right?

09:57.016 --> 09:59.644
Perfect, Duncan, just perfect.

10:01.521 --> 10:05.066
So, are you going
exploring with Golly, then?

10:05.149 --> 10:08.986
-Yeah, I think so. Jealous?
-No.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.074
Oh.

10:13.157 --> 10:15.785
Is there
anything I can get you?

10:15.868 --> 10:17.870
Yes, there is actually.

10:17.954 --> 10:20.665
We wouldn't happen
to have any liver
going spare would we?

10:20.748 --> 10:22.125
Liver?

10:22.208 --> 10:24.961
I've this sudden craving.

10:25.044 --> 10:28.673
Don't actually like the stuff,
completely irrational.

10:28.756 --> 10:30.800
Well,
I'll see what I can find.

10:30.883 --> 10:33.219
Raw. It must be raw.

10:35.847 --> 10:40.184
And some milk,
if you can spare it. Please.

10:44.313 --> 10:46.607
Funny tummy, Molly?

10:46.691 --> 10:49.819
My Auntie Liz
swears by milk and liver.

10:57.452 --> 11:00.580
-You look wonderful.
-Thank you.

11:00.663 --> 11:06.544
I just saw Molly heading
towards the tower. I think she
was talking to Hector.

11:06.627 --> 11:09.630
-Father?
-That's what it sounded like.

11:12.550 --> 11:14.761
Hmm.

11:14.844 --> 11:18.181
-The Lady of Glenbogle.
-The Lady of Glenbogle.

11:18.264 --> 11:19.557
Thank you.

11:22.101 --> 11:26.647
Now, I think this
happy occasion calls for
the Grand MacDonald, Archie.

11:26.731 --> 11:30.401
-I'll have a word with Golly.
-I thought you were the laird.

11:30.485 --> 11:33.738
-All right, we'll set off
first thing in the morning.
-Good man.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.656
What is the Grand MacDonald?

11:35.740 --> 11:39.327
Land a salmon, bag a grouse,
stalk and shoot a stag,
all in a day.

11:39.410 --> 11:42.705
-Then, of course,
there is the Royal MacDonald.
-What's that?

11:42.789 --> 11:45.208
All of the above,
plus you get to
bed the laird's wife.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.711
In your dreams.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.589
Father was the last person
to win the Grand MacDonald.
Hector was furious.

11:51.673 --> 11:54.842
He had to hand over the prize,
a case of
the laird's finest malt.

11:54.926 --> 11:57.887
Well,
I'll put up a bottle of port.

11:57.970 --> 12:00.181
-Times hard, Archie?
-No.

12:00.264 --> 12:03.142
And we've ordered a stripper.

12:03.226 --> 12:06.270
-What? When?
-Tomorrow night.

12:06.354 --> 12:09.482
I did promise you
a stag party, Archie.
I do hope you don't mind.

12:10.483 --> 12:12.485
Isn't that what boys do?

12:12.568 --> 12:14.112
(FOOTSTEPS)

12:15.196 --> 12:16.698
Ah.

12:20.243 --> 12:22.286
Canard a la Glenbogle.

12:24.914 --> 12:27.834
-So who was your best man?
-Duncan.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.378
Rush job, then.

12:30.461 --> 12:32.088
(DAVID LAUGHING)

12:34.298 --> 12:36.801
I did the tatties and...them.

12:36.884 --> 12:39.846
-Mangetout.
-Mangetout.

12:39.929 --> 12:41.097
Looks great.

12:42.765 --> 12:46.310
-Molly not joining us?
-No, no, it's been a long day.

12:46.394 --> 12:48.021
Oh, dear.

12:48.104 --> 12:51.357
Molly came into the kitchen
asking for raw liver and milk.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.359
DAVID: Do you still
play cricket after dinner?

12:53.443 --> 12:55.111
Well, we haven't done,
not for years.

12:55.194 --> 12:58.531
Excellent, that's settled,
then. You, Jonathan and,

12:58.614 --> 13:00.616
er, my stand-in,

13:00.700 --> 13:05.580
versus me, Lexie and...
Yes, we're one short.

13:05.663 --> 13:06.748
(BELL RINGING)

13:06.831 --> 13:08.207
Oh. I'll get it.

13:15.381 --> 13:17.175
You do scrub up well.

13:17.258 --> 13:20.762
The new Lady of Glenbogle.
It suits you, my dear.

13:20.845 --> 13:24.223
Thank you.
We weren't expecting
to see you again this evening.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.767
No...

13:25.850 --> 13:30.355
No, well, Molly did ask me
to drop in if I was passing,

13:30.438 --> 13:33.983
and there is a small matter
I need to discuss with her.

13:34.067 --> 13:35.693
(MEN LAUGHING)

13:35.777 --> 13:38.112
-Oh, I'm not intruding, am I?
-Archie's got
some friends over.

13:38.196 --> 13:42.033
The Fraser boy.
He was always a wilful child.

13:42.116 --> 13:45.703
-Where is Molly?
-Last seen going to the tower.

13:46.329 --> 13:47.830
Tower it is.

13:49.874 --> 13:51.334
DUNCAN: Cricket!

13:51.417 --> 13:53.670
I like a man who
plays cricket.
There's something

13:53.753 --> 13:55.797
solid and manly about it.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.176
The swing of the bat,
those red stains on
the bowler's crisp whites.

14:02.261 --> 14:04.681
Yeah, I love cricket.

14:04.764 --> 14:08.601
Yeah. The smack of
leather on...whatever.

14:08.685 --> 14:13.106
And my PE teacher
said I had ability.

14:17.777 --> 14:22.448
-Natural all-rounder.
Play football, too.
-I hate football.

14:22.532 --> 14:27.870
Yeah, I don't like it either.
I just play it...sometimes.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.998
Not often.
Hardly ever, in fact.

14:37.213 --> 14:40.925
MOLLY: Stop it! No.

14:44.137 --> 14:46.180
(PANTING)

14:46.264 --> 14:48.808
Oh, Hector, no.

14:48.891 --> 14:53.521
Now I shall have to clean
that up. Hector, stop it.

14:53.604 --> 14:55.481
(WHISPERING) Molly.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.484
-Who is it?
-It's me, Kilwillie.

14:59.736 --> 15:01.070
Just a minute.

15:01.154 --> 15:02.989
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

15:07.410 --> 15:11.956
-What do you want?
-Well, I was just
passing and I wondered...

15:12.040 --> 15:15.626
-Are you all right?
-Yes, perfectly, thank you.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.420
(DOOR LOCKING)

15:19.630 --> 15:21.299
May I come in?

15:26.471 --> 15:28.097
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

15:34.520 --> 15:36.856
What on earth are
you doing up here?

15:36.939 --> 15:40.943
Oh, I've decided
to convert the tower
into a conservatory.

15:41.027 --> 15:44.655
Observatory.
I'm taking up astrology.

15:44.739 --> 15:47.909
-Astronomy?
-Yes. Quite.

15:47.992 --> 15:50.828
Oh, I think that's
a marvellous idea.

15:50.912 --> 15:54.749
-There's a wonderful view
of the stars. Over there.
-Ooh!

15:54.832 --> 15:56.084
At night.

15:58.169 --> 16:02.340
-What sort of
telescope will you use?
-Do you think I'll need one?

16:03.508 --> 16:05.301
I should say.

16:07.637 --> 16:09.681
Kilwillie,
what would I do without you?

16:11.015 --> 16:15.061
(MOLLY HUMMING)

16:15.144 --> 16:18.064
Where did you learn
all this
archaeology stuff, Golly?

16:18.147 --> 16:20.692
Folk tales. Books.

16:20.775 --> 16:23.778
-Books?
-Yeah, books.
Library's full of them.

16:27.615 --> 16:30.576
Well, it's up to you, Golly,
but I don't
think Irene'll enjoy

16:30.660 --> 16:33.287
all this archaeology
clambering over rocks stuff.

16:33.371 --> 16:37.667
Since when were you the expert
on what Irene
likes or doesn't like?

16:37.750 --> 16:40.670
I may know more
than you think, Golly.

16:40.753 --> 16:43.548
Take cricket, for example.

16:43.631 --> 16:47.176
-She likes cricket, does she?
-She thinks it's
a game for wussies.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.636
Oh.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.933
Now football, Golly,
that's a different matter.

16:54.017 --> 16:58.271
She loves a man
who plays football.
She's mad for it.

17:00.189 --> 17:01.441
Football.

17:03.568 --> 17:04.569
Right.

17:07.530 --> 17:11.534
I've gone solo, so to speak.
It's the best
decision I have ever made.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.953
Plenty of city contacts,
old mates like Jonathan,

17:14.037 --> 17:15.538
the money's gonna
come rolling in.

17:15.621 --> 17:19.083
And nothing
begets money, Archie,
like money itself.

17:19.166 --> 17:22.002
You know we're
not too dissimilar
you and I, entrepreneurs.

17:22.086 --> 17:26.214
I know it's an appalling word,
but one thing about
our lot, we sink or swim,

17:26.299 --> 17:29.093
evolve or die.

17:29.177 --> 17:33.389
-You swimming or sinking,
Archie?
-Treading water mostly.

17:33.473 --> 17:35.016
Settled the death duties yet?

17:35.099 --> 17:38.227
-No.
-Hector's last laugh.

17:38.311 --> 17:40.521
Yeah, one of many.

17:40.605 --> 17:43.149
I've got
a proposition for you.

17:44.567 --> 17:48.029
Lexie, who needs
a stripper when we've got you?

17:51.532 --> 17:53.368
It's a joke, Lex.

17:56.913 --> 17:58.873
Forgive me. Would you?

18:05.254 --> 18:06.755
Thank you, Archie.

18:10.677 --> 18:13.554
-Are you not joining me?
-No, thanks.

18:13.638 --> 18:17.308
Archie always did know
when he'd had enough.
Just like Sarah.

18:17.392 --> 18:21.020
-I'd like to meet her.
-You will.

18:23.523 --> 18:26.943
-And have you phoned her?
-Phoned her?

18:27.026 --> 18:30.113
Yeah. To let her
know you arrived safely.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.989
I called her on the mobile.

18:32.990 --> 18:34.951
And is she missing you?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.412
Desperately.

18:38.955 --> 18:40.248
I bet.

18:44.002 --> 18:47.964
1994 was particularly
exciting for astronomers.

18:48.047 --> 18:53.219
We saw the most
dramatic solar systems
encounter in living memory.

18:53.302 --> 18:56.014
The Hubble Telescope
had just been repaired

18:56.097 --> 18:59.058
and it was sending back
remarkable images.

19:00.935 --> 19:04.564
That was
a splendid year, Molly.

19:04.647 --> 19:07.775
You know, Molly,
I've got something to say.

19:12.113 --> 19:16.242
It's rather delicate,
very pressing and
not at all easy.

19:16.325 --> 19:18.911
Kilwillie, I really
must ask you to leave.

19:18.995 --> 19:21.247
It's getting late.

19:21.330 --> 19:23.666
Oh, well, yes, of course.

19:25.168 --> 19:27.503
-Good night.
-Good night.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.221
What do you know about nickel?

19:37.305 --> 19:41.559
-Not a lot.
-No, nor did I
until a few weeks ago.

19:41.642 --> 19:44.645
But it seems that
for sometime now,

19:44.729 --> 19:49.108
the price of
nickel has been rising
as supplies have dropped off.

19:49.192 --> 19:55.073
Now, I have it on the very
best authority that all that's
about to change.

19:55.156 --> 19:59.243
You see, the nickel market
is due a temporary collapse
in precisely three weeks,

19:59.327 --> 20:02.038
when several tons of the stuff
will be flooded
onto the world markets.

20:02.121 --> 20:07.251
Now, when that happens,
the price will
fall by 30% or more.

20:07.335 --> 20:09.962
-So that's when we buy.
-We?

20:10.046 --> 20:11.881
Just hear me out.

20:11.964 --> 20:15.051
We buy, we hold our nerve
for six months when the price
will rise again.

20:15.134 --> 20:20.223
Now the minimum investment
my contacts are
looking for is Â£20,000.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.809
I can raise 10, but no more.

20:22.892 --> 20:25.186
You need another 10?

20:25.269 --> 20:26.813
You're catching on.
Interested?

20:26.896 --> 20:29.190
LEXIE: (LAUGHING) Archie.

20:29.273 --> 20:32.318
-It's a lot of money.
-It's a lot of
money we haven't got.

20:32.402 --> 20:35.863
Well, let's forget I
ever said anything,
if you really haven't got it.

20:35.947 --> 20:38.366
-No, we haven't.
-No, no, no, I could raise it.

20:38.449 --> 20:41.536
-If the deal was right.
-Good man.

20:41.619 --> 20:43.871
What sort of
return could I expect?

20:43.955 --> 20:45.957
Enough to pay off
some of your debts.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.001
Give you a five star honeymoon
in the Bahamas.

20:48.084 --> 20:49.877
You'll treble your money.

20:49.961 --> 20:53.214
-Â£30,000.
-I'm doing you a favour,
Archie.

20:55.717 --> 20:59.262
-I'll think about it.
-Break the habit of
a lifetime. Take a chance.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.222
-Archie.
-Entirely up to you of course.

21:01.305 --> 21:03.975
I said I'll think about it.
That's all.

21:05.393 --> 21:06.769
You do that, Archie.

21:10.898 --> 21:14.485
Old times and
better times to come.

21:18.114 --> 21:19.198
Lex?

21:20.575 --> 21:24.954
I'm going to look for
Jonathan. Excuse me.

21:46.351 --> 21:48.770
I'm afraid I got lost.

21:48.853 --> 21:50.813
Well, it's easily done.

21:53.566 --> 21:56.736
It's like a sort
of time capsule.

21:59.781 --> 22:01.866
This is Jamie's room.
What are you doing here?

22:01.949 --> 22:04.369
I was just
showing Jonathan around.

22:04.452 --> 22:06.537
That's my penknife.

22:07.663 --> 22:10.708
He stole it, Jamie, you old...

22:10.792 --> 22:12.794
He won it.

22:12.877 --> 22:15.755
You bet him
he couldn't make
my father say "bum".

22:15.838 --> 22:18.383
So I did.

22:18.466 --> 22:22.470
God, this is
a bloody museum, Archie.
Jamie hated museums.

22:24.555 --> 22:27.058
He's gone, Archie.

22:27.141 --> 22:30.311
You should have a clear out.
Time to put this
lot behind you.

22:30.895 --> 22:32.772
Hmm.

22:32.855 --> 22:35.400
I just haven't
got round to it yet.

22:37.944 --> 22:40.071
(DAVID LAUGHING)

22:42.365 --> 22:44.075
You on?

22:52.667 --> 22:54.794
KILWILLIE: Well done, Lexie!

22:54.877 --> 22:56.421
-Good running.
-Come on, Arch.

22:56.504 --> 22:59.007
LEXIE: You could've
thrown it a bit better.

22:59.090 --> 23:01.592
Is that a football
shirt Golly's wearing?

23:01.676 --> 23:07.181
Yeah, he's mad about football,
hates cricket. Thinks it's
a game for wussies.

23:07.265 --> 23:09.642
Huh!

23:09.726 --> 23:12.770
Come on, Jonathan, single.
One run.

23:17.817 --> 23:19.610
Yes, right!

23:19.694 --> 23:21.738
Lexie, come on!

23:22.321 --> 23:23.948
Howzat!

23:24.490 --> 23:25.950
Howzat!

23:26.034 --> 23:27.160
He's in! He's in!

23:27.243 --> 23:29.120
-I was in.
-Sorry, Archie.

23:29.203 --> 23:31.914
-He was in.
-Yes!

23:31.998 --> 23:33.833
-Yes!
-Thank you, Golly.

23:37.003 --> 23:39.630
One run, Dunc.
That's all we need.

23:39.714 --> 23:41.674
You can count on me, Archie.

23:44.218 --> 23:46.346
(HUMMING CHILDISHLY)

23:46.429 --> 23:48.139
I was in by a mile.

23:48.222 --> 23:50.391
-It doesn't matter.
-Course it matters.

23:52.685 --> 23:54.103
GOLLY: Duncan.

23:56.356 --> 23:58.649
Do you think
Irene's noticed the shirt?

23:58.733 --> 24:00.943
Oh, yeah, definitely.

24:01.027 --> 24:04.197
LEXIE: Come on, David.

24:04.280 --> 24:07.950
ARCHIE: Come on.
Crafty single. That's all
we need. You can do it.

24:15.416 --> 24:18.044
Oh. Don't mind me.

24:18.127 --> 24:21.047
Oh, cricket, lovely.

24:31.849 --> 24:34.727
-Kilwillie.
-I'm trying to field, old boy.

24:34.811 --> 24:38.398
-It's about Mother.
-Oh,
is there anything I can do?

24:38.481 --> 24:41.401
-We're a bit worried
about her, actually.
-DAVID: What's going on?

24:41.484 --> 24:45.363
Lexie's heard her talking
to herself. We think she might
be talking to Father.

24:45.446 --> 24:47.156
Archie, we're supposed
to be playing cricket.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.450
She's been asking
for raw liver.

24:49.534 --> 24:51.452
-Oh, dear.
-And milk.

24:51.536 --> 24:54.497
-LEXIE: Archie?
-Oh, no, poor Molly.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.334
I think she needs a hobby,
something to occupy herself.

24:58.418 --> 25:02.463
Do you know,
I may know just the thing.
You leave it to me, old boy.

25:02.547 --> 25:05.341
-Lord Kilwillie?
-Yes, yes, we're ready.
On we go.

25:10.722 --> 25:12.682
Come on, Dunc, one run.

25:31.909 --> 25:33.453
Howzat!

25:33.536 --> 25:35.955
A six. A six, that's a six.

(ALL SHOUTING)

25:37.498 --> 25:38.958
Catch!

25:42.962 --> 25:44.255
-Yes!
-Yes!

25:44.339 --> 25:46.007
I don't believe it.

25:48.051 --> 25:50.011
That's terribly wrong.

25:55.099 --> 25:58.227
So much for house rules.
We don't know house rules.

25:58.311 --> 26:01.564
-Well,
it's not my house rules.
-Sorry, mate. What can I say?

26:01.647 --> 26:03.858
-Thank you very much.
-Yeah.

26:06.569 --> 26:09.405
Well, you can't
win them all, David.

26:13.993 --> 26:15.453
(WHIMPERING)

26:56.494 --> 26:58.913
You're not really
gonna give him any money,
are you?

26:58.996 --> 27:00.665
It's an investment.

27:00.748 --> 27:04.585
-Why don't you just
tell him the truth?
-Tell him what?

27:04.669 --> 27:08.715
-That we
haven't got the money.
-I might be able to raise it.

27:08.798 --> 27:13.636
If you can raise that sort
of money, we could do with
spending it around here.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.306
We could have a honeymoon,
Lex,
you heard what he said.

27:36.784 --> 27:40.413
Do you not think it's
a bit weird that he hasn't
even phoned Sarah?

27:40.496 --> 27:43.332
I mean, if you were away for
a weekend, you would phone me,
wouldn't you?

27:43.416 --> 27:45.543
How do you know he
hasn't phoned her?

27:45.626 --> 27:48.546
When did you last get a signal
on a mobile up here?

27:55.261 --> 27:58.306
No, Hector, not in there.

27:58.389 --> 28:02.935
ARCHIE: I'm sure he's
very sorry that he thought
you were the housekeeper.

28:03.019 --> 28:07.023
Being your wife is no
guarantee that your friends
are gonna like me.

28:07.106 --> 28:09.484
Nor that you're
gonna like them.

28:11.069 --> 28:13.112
I never said I
didn't like him.

28:13.946 --> 28:16.074
It's pretty obvious.

28:16.157 --> 28:20.620
-I have known him
a very long time.
-I know.

28:20.703 --> 28:22.997
Well, maybe you could
make more of an effort.

28:23.081 --> 28:24.457
(SIGHS)

28:27.627 --> 28:29.879
I'm sorry if you
think I don't like him.

28:31.255 --> 28:33.633
I'm gonna go to sleep now.
Good night.

28:58.950 --> 29:02.120
-Lex?
-What?

29:03.121 --> 29:05.039
Can you smell bacon?

29:53.921 --> 29:55.381
LEXIE: Morning, Molly.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.177
Have you and Archie
had a falling out?

30:01.929 --> 30:03.806
I can't help it.

30:03.890 --> 30:09.937
I've tried for Archie's sake
but...I just don't like David.

30:10.021 --> 30:11.773
He is an acquired taste.

30:12.815 --> 30:14.525
Like cod liver oil.

30:15.902 --> 30:17.737
ARCHIE: Yay, I win!

30:17.820 --> 30:20.239
-You got me on a bad day.
-Yeah, right.

30:20.323 --> 30:24.243
David has to be
the best at everything.
It's a family trait.

30:26.913 --> 30:29.791
I imagine he's
feeling rather rootless
at the moment.

30:29.874 --> 30:35.588
He'll say it's freedom or some
such nonsense, but it comes
to the same in the end.

30:35.672 --> 30:37.298
Yes!

30:37.382 --> 30:40.551
Archie, on the other hand,
has found his place,

30:40.635 --> 30:42.553
and you and Archie
have found each other.

30:45.723 --> 30:48.685
Well, I just don't like
the way he treats Archie.

30:49.977 --> 30:51.938
Don't be too hard on him.

30:52.021 --> 30:56.609
He needs us and I suppose,
in a way,
we need him.

30:57.485 --> 30:59.529
Why would we need David?

31:02.740 --> 31:04.742
To keep the memories alive.

31:06.911 --> 31:09.288
Don't let him
feel too pushed out.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.346
What do you think?
Smart enough for Irene?

31:25.430 --> 31:26.931
Is she dressing up, then?

31:27.015 --> 31:28.891
Thought we might go
for a wee drink later.

31:37.525 --> 31:40.528
-She likes flowers.
-Does she?

31:40.611 --> 31:42.613
Bouquets.

31:42.697 --> 31:47.118
You know, flowers out of
a shop with a wee written
note on and that...

31:47.201 --> 31:48.995
flower food stuff.

31:50.747 --> 31:52.415
Bigger the better.

31:52.498 --> 31:56.002
She's not one
for a single rose.

31:56.085 --> 31:59.297
"A man has to show he cares,"
that's what she said.

32:01.257 --> 32:04.469
Right. Yeah, thanks, Duncan.

32:06.095 --> 32:07.889
No worries, Golly.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.577
-Archie's not here.
-I know.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.670
DAVID: Can we start again?

32:38.753 --> 32:42.215
Archie and I go
back a long way.
I'd hate to fall out with him.

32:43.883 --> 32:47.095
Yes, me, too.

32:48.221 --> 32:51.182
We have something in common.

32:51.265 --> 32:54.686
Listen, do you think we
could be friends, David?

32:54.769 --> 32:57.897
Yeah, I'm sure we can.

33:00.566 --> 33:02.777
I just don't want
you to feel, you know,

33:02.860 --> 33:06.364
just because me and Archie
are married now that...

33:06.447 --> 33:08.825
-That you'll come between us?
-Yeah.

33:09.909 --> 33:11.160
You won't.

33:31.431 --> 33:33.725
You'll be late.

33:33.808 --> 33:36.978
-Can't start without me.
-Me neither.

33:38.521 --> 33:40.565
-Are you coming, too?
-Don't worry.

33:40.648 --> 33:43.067
I'm only there to
help with the picnic.

33:48.322 --> 33:49.490
Good.

34:01.961 --> 34:04.672
LEXIE: They're having fun, eh?
The boys.

34:06.090 --> 34:08.551
GOLLY: How about yourself?

34:08.634 --> 34:14.306
If I think David's bad
for Archie, I should tell him,
shouldn't I?

34:14.389 --> 34:18.936
Well, if anyone's gonna
tell him, it would be better
coming from his wife.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.897
Is that what
marriage is all about?

34:20.980 --> 34:23.274
Telling your husband
he's making a fool of himself.

34:23.358 --> 34:25.068
I wouldn't know about that.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.288
Why have you never married?

34:39.873 --> 34:41.417
I don't know.

34:44.379 --> 34:47.090
It's because you're
a free spirit, Golly.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.634
-Is that what I am?
-Aye.

34:49.717 --> 34:52.929
A free spirit.

34:53.012 --> 34:57.642
See all this? All this
and no one to share it with.

34:57.725 --> 35:01.646
That's not being free, Lexie.
That's just being lonely.

35:06.693 --> 35:09.779
Archie. Look.

35:11.114 --> 35:13.157
Well done.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.159
Here we go.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.662
Oh, and listen,
that's between you and me.

35:17.745 --> 35:20.498
As far as anyone
else is concerned,
I'm a free spirit.

35:21.124 --> 35:23.543
-Okay.
-Okay.

35:28.089 --> 35:30.425
GOLLY: Okay. Just one more.

35:31.801 --> 35:33.428
That's it.

35:35.555 --> 35:38.641
Archie, everything all
right with you and Lexie?

35:38.725 --> 35:40.601
Yeah, fine.
Why shouldn't it be?

35:40.685 --> 35:42.395
Bit of a chill
in the vicinity.

35:42.478 --> 35:44.939
Have you thought any more
about my proposal?

35:45.023 --> 35:48.609
-Yeah, I will. I promise.
-Make sure you do. Thanks.

35:59.495 --> 36:00.997
Well done, David.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.876
-A kiss for the winner?
-What?

36:04.958 --> 36:09.047
-It's the custom.
-You've not won yet.

36:09.129 --> 36:11.841
-On account, then.
-What are you doing?

36:11.924 --> 36:14.469
-Archie's not watching.
-Yeah, well I am.

36:30.360 --> 36:32.070
Good shot, Archie.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.203
Mine.

36:43.664 --> 36:44.707
Yes.

36:46.417 --> 36:48.127
-Jonathan!
-What?

36:56.511 --> 36:57.929
Did I hit anything?

37:00.098 --> 37:02.350
Yes,
Jonathan, I believe you did.

37:11.651 --> 37:13.945
What's, er, Sarah like?

37:15.446 --> 37:18.199
-Who?
-David's fiancee.

37:18.282 --> 37:20.118
Oh, I wouldn't know.

37:20.201 --> 37:21.661
I've only known David
for a few weeks.

37:21.744 --> 37:24.247
We met through a mutual
business acquaintance.

37:24.330 --> 37:27.125
This is a sort of
a business trip.

37:27.208 --> 37:30.920
-"Corporate entertainment"
I think he called it.
-Oh.

37:31.004 --> 37:34.090
-A business trip?
-Oh.

37:34.173 --> 37:37.927
I shouldn't have said that.
David swore me to secrecy.

37:38.011 --> 37:41.472
Still, no harm done, eh?

37:50.982 --> 37:54.193
Did you know that
archaeological investigation

37:54.277 --> 38:02.160
is our main source
of knowledge for prehistoric,
ancient and very old things?

38:02.243 --> 38:07.123
(SHOUTING) I've always
been very interested in
prehistoric archaeology.

38:07.206 --> 38:11.252
I mean,
even before man could write
the archaeologist was king!

38:11.336 --> 38:12.920
(IN NORMAL VOICE) King.

38:13.004 --> 38:15.256
You don't have to compete,
Duncan.

38:15.340 --> 38:20.636
No, really, even at school,
my archaeology teacher
said I had natural ability.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.931
I'm not a bone for you
and Golly to fight over.

38:24.015 --> 38:26.434
I like you the way you are.

38:28.061 --> 38:29.896
-You do?
-Yes.

38:31.522 --> 38:33.649
You mean you're
not interested in me
for my mind?

38:33.733 --> 38:36.486
-No.
-Me neither.

38:48.456 --> 38:49.582
Sorry.

39:04.847 --> 39:06.182
There.

39:12.271 --> 39:13.481
Mine, I think.

39:14.565 --> 39:16.484
-No.
-I saw it first.

39:18.945 --> 39:21.614
Just like you
taught me, Golly.

39:24.701 --> 39:26.869
Just like you taught me.

39:31.791 --> 39:34.210
-Why did you do that?
-You didn't deserve it.

39:34.293 --> 39:36.004
And Archie did, I suppose?

39:36.087 --> 39:37.547
Just give me the gun.

39:39.424 --> 39:40.466
Golly.

39:44.303 --> 39:46.347
Golly, he's a guest.

39:46.431 --> 39:49.142
If you're any kind of friend
to him, Archie, you'd sort him
out about a few things.

39:49.225 --> 39:52.061
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Open your eyes, son.

39:54.856 --> 39:56.566
He's right, Archie.

39:58.234 --> 40:00.028
This has nothing
to do with you.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.814
I mean, why do you
think Jonathan's here?

40:36.898 --> 40:38.941
He's an old college
friend of David's.

40:39.025 --> 40:42.653
No, he isn't.
He hardly even knows him.

40:42.737 --> 40:45.782
He's just a business
acquaintance and David
is using this weekend

40:45.865 --> 40:47.325
to try and impress him.

40:47.408 --> 40:49.952
Another one of
his scams, no doubt.

40:53.164 --> 40:57.293
-He lied to you, Archie.
-He must have had his reasons.

40:57.377 --> 41:00.046
Yeah, he saw you coming.
Has done ever
since you were boys.

41:00.129 --> 41:02.965
Look, just because
you don't like the man,
it doesn't mean he's a crook.

41:03.049 --> 41:04.634
He made a pass at me.

41:33.705 --> 41:38.459
Hi. It's about the bouquet.
I phoned earlier.

41:38.543 --> 41:41.170
The "romance special"
I think it's called.

41:41.254 --> 41:44.007
-Golly?
-Ah, Kilwillie.

41:48.594 --> 41:52.974
-Thank you.
-Isn't that a bit
girly for a gillie, Golly?

41:57.729 --> 42:01.149
MOLLY:
It won't be long now, Hector.

42:06.446 --> 42:08.448
Ta-da!

42:08.531 --> 42:11.159
Oh, you fool, Kilwillie.
You've let him escape!

42:13.036 --> 42:14.829
-What's that?
-It's a surprise.

42:14.912 --> 42:16.581
I've no time for surprises.

42:16.664 --> 42:19.709
-It's a telescope
for your observatory.
-What observatory?

42:19.792 --> 42:22.211
You said you
were going to have
an observatory in the tower.

42:22.295 --> 42:25.506
There's
a particularly interesting
alignment of Venus tonight

42:25.590 --> 42:29.218
-and I thought we
could watch it together.
-Sounds fascinating.

42:29.302 --> 42:34.599
-Hector, Hector.
-Molly, Hector is dead.

42:34.682 --> 42:37.894
Kilwillie,
I know Hector is dead.

42:37.977 --> 42:41.481
Well, then, why, Molly dear,
do you persist
in talking to him?

42:41.564 --> 42:45.651
-It's so dreadfully American.
-I was talking to
Hector the wolf cub.

42:45.735 --> 42:47.737
-Wolf cub?
-The runt

42:47.820 --> 42:51.783
that I rescued from certain
death, at great personal risk
to myself I might add.

42:51.866 --> 42:54.702
And you, Kilwillie,
have let him escape.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.288
Oh, Molly.

43:02.251 --> 43:05.588
Thank you, Golly.
That was fascinating.

43:05.672 --> 43:08.257
Burial sites are
definitely my thing.

43:08.341 --> 43:11.260
Listen, I know a place
where the wind doesn't blow

43:11.344 --> 43:15.556
and the sky's so low you feel
you can reach up
and touch the stars.

43:15.640 --> 43:17.975
That's a lovely thought,
Golly.

43:18.059 --> 43:20.937
-Another time maybe.
-Right.

43:22.480 --> 43:23.523
Right.

43:42.542 --> 43:44.711
I thought you'd
lost your marbles.

43:44.794 --> 43:46.629
Lost my marbles?

43:46.713 --> 43:48.840
Archie asked me to
keep an eye on you.

43:48.923 --> 43:51.259
-He did, did he?
-Yes.

43:51.342 --> 43:53.136
So, that's what
all this is about.

43:53.219 --> 43:55.805
Keeping the doddering
old dowager happy.

43:55.888 --> 43:57.598
Molly, these are from me.

43:57.682 --> 44:00.977
Tokens of my very
deep and profound
admiration...

44:01.060 --> 44:03.688
I am disappointed
in you, really I am.

44:05.106 --> 44:07.150
I'm sorry, Molly.
I am terribly sorry.

44:07.233 --> 44:10.695
Now, if you want to
make up for this treachery,

44:10.778 --> 44:14.532
you'll help me find the cub
and you won't breathe
a word of it to anyone.

44:14.615 --> 44:16.242
Whatever you say.

44:20.830 --> 44:25.251
I lost my job
three months ago.

44:25.335 --> 44:29.005
One or two speculative
moves that went wrong.

44:30.631 --> 44:32.050
A little bit too much of this.

44:35.845 --> 44:39.223
So, I struck out on my own.

44:39.307 --> 44:42.185
So far things
haven't quite worked out.

44:46.397 --> 44:50.693
Well, er,
money's gone, Sarah with it.

44:50.777 --> 44:54.447
I don't suppose she
could stand the "for richer,
for poorer" bit.

44:56.199 --> 44:58.826
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Jamie's little brother?

45:01.329 --> 45:03.664
I don't need your sympathy,
Archie.

45:05.041 --> 45:06.793
Just my money, hmm?

45:12.215 --> 45:17.345
-There is no
nickel thing, is there?
-No.

45:17.428 --> 45:20.348
-So what were you
going to do with the money?
-It was a loan.

45:20.431 --> 45:23.351
-I'd have given it back.
-When?

45:27.522 --> 45:30.066
-And who exactly is Jonathan?
-Business acquaintance.

45:30.149 --> 45:32.485
-Not a friend?
-I'm working on that.

45:32.568 --> 45:35.988
If you wanted to
use me and my house
for corporate entertainment,

45:36.072 --> 45:39.033
-all you had to do was ask.
-Well, I'll know to next time.

45:41.786 --> 45:43.496
There won't be a next time.

45:54.090 --> 45:55.967
Okay, David,

45:56.050 --> 45:59.137
-what happened with
Lexie this morning?
-What do you mean?

45:59.220 --> 46:03.099
You know exactly what I mean.
Unless, of course, you're
saying my wife is a liar.

46:04.058 --> 46:07.770
What is this, kiss and tell?

46:07.854 --> 46:10.523
Come on,
Archie, just a bit of fun.

46:11.983 --> 46:15.653
How much fun exactly?

46:15.737 --> 46:20.324
Pretty girl. You should
know...quite a lot actually.

46:21.617 --> 46:24.203
I was going for
the Royal MacDonald.

46:28.374 --> 46:31.586
I needed to take
something away with me.

46:39.510 --> 46:41.304
That was a lucky punch.

46:44.640 --> 46:48.394
Boys, that's enough.
I said that's enough.

46:55.526 --> 46:57.737
Sorry, Golly, I'm all right.

46:58.571 --> 47:00.948
Stop it.

47:02.533 --> 47:04.494
I think you'd better go.

47:14.796 --> 47:19.676
-I had him,
Golly, I really had him.
-Yes, son, I believe you did.

47:19.759 --> 47:22.261
(IRENE SCREAMING)

47:24.055 --> 47:28.976
Easy now. Easy there,
that's it, that's it.

47:29.060 --> 47:32.772
Easy now. Easy boy, easy.

47:32.855 --> 47:35.566
Take care, stay back.

47:35.650 --> 47:39.737
Oh, come on, Hector.

47:39.821 --> 47:44.784
Some nice people from
the wild animal sanctuary
are coming to collect you.

47:44.867 --> 47:47.954
So, you see,
I haven't lost my marbles.

47:49.956 --> 47:51.582
She's wonderful.

47:51.666 --> 47:54.419
I don't know what
you were worried about,
old boy.

47:55.712 --> 47:57.797
Have you been fighting?

48:16.774 --> 48:21.821
It's just seeing you
and Molly and the house,

48:23.489 --> 48:27.118
I wanted it to be
like it always was.

48:27.201 --> 48:29.829
Things will never
be the same, David.

48:30.955 --> 48:33.708
-You can't say I didn't try.
-No.

48:55.938 --> 48:58.775
Are you two
boys friends again?

48:58.858 --> 49:00.735
I don't know.

49:01.486 --> 49:03.446
He reminds me of Hector.

49:04.322 --> 49:07.200
-Father?
-No, the runt.

49:07.283 --> 49:09.202
I feel sorry for David.

49:09.285 --> 49:12.538
-You're not thinking of
taking him in as well?
-No.

49:14.832 --> 49:16.501
It's time to move on, Mother.

49:17.669 --> 49:20.963
Jamie's gone. So is Father.

49:22.965 --> 49:27.220
Talking of which,
I think it's time
we cleared out Jamie's room.

49:28.346 --> 49:31.516
Yes.
Yes, I believe you're right.

49:38.731 --> 49:42.026
You've got to impose
your will on the beasties.
Show them who's boss.

49:42.110 --> 49:44.862
One wrong move
and you're dead.

49:46.239 --> 49:50.660
Duncan...you are
a very brave man.

49:52.245 --> 49:54.372
Well, wolves are dangerous...

49:57.917 --> 49:59.669
Natural born...

50:02.338 --> 50:03.756
Ask Golly...

50:07.093 --> 50:08.761
Maybe not.

50:15.810 --> 50:18.312
-Have they gone?
-Yeah.

50:22.984 --> 50:26.738
-Will you miss him?
-Probably.

50:26.821 --> 50:29.824
Even though he brings
out the worst in me.

50:29.907 --> 50:32.994
-I could have told you that.
-I think you did.

50:35.705 --> 50:39.042
-If you love me...
-And I do.

50:39.125 --> 50:41.419
Then you must
tell me everything.

50:44.922 --> 50:47.967
-What?
-Nothing.

50:48.051 --> 50:50.219
