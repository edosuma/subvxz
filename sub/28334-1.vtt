Ripped from SPECTACLE version. 
Resynced by <font color="#ff0000">Boyancy</font>.

02:09.042 --> 02:10.334
May I speak with you, Sire

02:13.667 --> 02:14.667
Sire

02:19.292 --> 02:20.459
Sire

02:21.584 --> 02:22.667
Commander...

02:25.084 --> 02:26.209
Him again

02:28.751 --> 02:29.792
What now?

02:30.542 --> 02:32.751
He visited Jing City yesterday

02:33.001 --> 02:34.042
What?

02:34.876 --> 02:35.917
He went to Jing

02:36.709 --> 02:37.834
For what?

02:37.876 --> 02:40.167
To give Yang a birthday greeting

02:41.167 --> 02:42.167
He went yesterday

02:42.209 --> 02:45.001
and you only tell me now?

02:45.209 --> 02:46.167
Lu

02:46.209 --> 02:47.709
My most trusted minister

02:48.167 --> 02:50.042
This is how you serve me?

02:52.251 --> 02:53.251
Has he returned?

02:53.292 --> 02:54.167
Not yet

02:55.501 --> 02:56.917
Go, wait for him

02:57.542 --> 02:58.584
The minute he returns

02:59.251 --> 03:00.292
bring him to me right away

03:00.667 --> 03:01.459
Yes, Sire

03:01.626 --> 03:04.626
"COMMANDER'S RESIDENCE"

03:22.834 --> 03:23.709
What does it say?

03:33.501 --> 03:34.376
This reading

03:34.417 --> 03:35.709
is about masculine power

03:36.042 --> 03:37.626
No place for women here

03:39.209 --> 03:41.542
Qian, the male, origin of all things

03:41.834 --> 03:42.876
shall rule the world

03:43.709 --> 03:44.709
This reading

03:45.042 --> 03:46.042
is "Qian"

03:46.917 --> 03:47.876
This is Heaven's will

03:48.959 --> 03:49.751
Brother

03:49.792 --> 03:50.959
There's been talk of this in the Palace

03:51.001 --> 03:52.667
The reading's also a positive sign

03:54.834 --> 03:56.292
When will the battle begin?

03:56.334 --> 03:57.417
Summer, or autumn?

03:57.876 --> 03:59.167
The reading says...

03:59.667 --> 04:01.167
Our time will come in seven days

04:01.709 --> 04:02.709
Seven days?

04:03.167 --> 04:04.626
After seven days of rain

04:05.042 --> 04:06.792
we'll win when the waters rise

04:08.751 --> 04:11.376
The Commander enters!

04:12.959 --> 04:14.792
Our brave lone hero has returned!

04:14.834 --> 04:16.166
Sister

04:18.334 --> 04:19.541
Reporting

04:19.584 --> 04:20.666
Sire

04:20.750 --> 04:22.041
Sire

04:22.459 --> 04:23.792
I've heard

04:24.001 --> 04:26.292
you went to celebrate Yang's birthday

04:26.542 --> 04:27.626
Yes

04:27.667 --> 04:31.209
I'm sure you gave a lovely speech

04:32.334 --> 04:34.001
I went to Jing to claim one thing

04:35.376 --> 04:38.084
The city YAN Kingdom has occupied for 20 years

04:38.542 --> 04:40.042
Is he willing to return it?

04:40.084 --> 04:41.001
No

04:41.042 --> 04:43.042
So you declared war?

04:43.667 --> 04:45.167
Yang and I have agreed

04:45.501 --> 04:46.834
in a few days, under the City Pass

04:46.876 --> 04:48.251
to duel one-on-one

04:48.292 --> 04:49.626
and see who wins

04:50.459 --> 04:52.292
Our two nations are allies

04:53.126 --> 04:55.334
A duel between our chief commanders

04:55.376 --> 04:56.917
means war

04:58.417 --> 05:00.042
Don't you understand this?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.667
He agreed to it

05:02.167 --> 05:03.251
Alright then

05:04.084 --> 05:05.167
Tell me

05:06.126 --> 05:07.292
Are you sure

05:07.334 --> 05:09.126
you can beat him?

05:15.126 --> 05:16.834
Yes or no?

05:19.667 --> 05:21.876
What are your odds?

05:23.501 --> 05:24.667
3 out of 10 at best

05:24.709 --> 05:26.084
Absurd

05:27.792 --> 05:32.751
Were it not for our Peace Treaty

05:32.792 --> 05:35.084
Pei would have been lost long ago

05:36.376 --> 05:38.167
Great work

05:38.209 --> 05:42.084
You've ruined everything

05:42.126 --> 05:44.001
Jing City still belongs to Pei

05:44.751 --> 05:46.667
It's under YAN Kingdom's occupation

05:47.334 --> 05:48.959
Every righteous man of Pei

05:49.001 --> 05:51.042
longs to win it back

05:51.709 --> 05:53.209
No ruler can oppose his people's will

05:53.917 --> 05:55.251
If Jing isn't reclaimed

05:55.292 --> 05:57.626
Pei will perish under your reign

05:57.667 --> 05:58.501
Commander

05:58.542 --> 06:00.042
How dare you say that?

06:00.751 --> 06:02.876
I'd rather never take Jing back

06:02.917 --> 06:04.792
than destroy the Alliance

06:04.834 --> 06:06.209
On your behalf

06:06.251 --> 06:07.834
I've told them otherwise

06:08.292 --> 06:11.042
And would you also be King on my behalf?

06:17.751 --> 06:19.084
What's done is done

06:20.959 --> 06:23.001
And my punishment?

06:31.626 --> 06:32.667
Alright

06:34.459 --> 06:35.376
Let's not argue

06:36.126 --> 06:37.626
Father died too early

06:38.584 --> 06:40.376
My sister and I had only each other

06:41.917 --> 06:43.501
It was thanks to you, Commander

06:44.334 --> 06:46.042
that I finally gained the throne

06:49.792 --> 06:51.334
Let's drop the subject

06:51.376 --> 06:53.376
Sire is right

06:53.417 --> 06:57.709
Let's just enjoy this rare gathering

07:00.626 --> 07:01.917
I've long heard that

07:02.459 --> 07:08.459
you and your wife play the most exquisite duets

07:09.626 --> 07:11.209
I've always wanted to hear you

07:11.751 --> 07:12.876
So

07:13.417 --> 07:14.751
Will you play for me?

07:15.501 --> 07:16.667
Sire

07:16.709 --> 07:18.126
Our Kingdom is in distress

07:18.167 --> 07:20.459
I'm... not in the mood

07:20.501 --> 07:21.917
Commander

07:21.959 --> 07:24.959
Don't disappoint the King

07:27.292 --> 07:28.417
Yes, please

07:28.459 --> 07:29.709
We'll all enjoy your music

07:30.667 --> 07:31.459
Come

07:31.501 --> 07:32.667
Bring the zithers

07:50.626 --> 07:51.542
Come

07:51.792 --> 07:52.667
Come

07:53.292 --> 07:54.251
Come

07:54.792 --> 07:56.042
Please

08:05.667 --> 08:06.709
What?

08:08.209 --> 08:09.876
I, your King

08:11.667 --> 08:13.501
Can't get you to play for me?

08:21.126 --> 08:22.376
Commander

08:43.417 --> 08:44.167
Sire

08:44.208 --> 08:45.334
I am guilty

08:45.709 --> 08:47.376
You haven't started yet

08:47.417 --> 08:48.626
What could you be guilty of?

08:48.667 --> 08:50.709
I will not distract my husband

08:51.501 --> 08:53.251
with beautiful sights and sounds

08:54.251 --> 08:56.209
I've sworn to Heaven

08:57.001 --> 08:58.792
that until the day Jing's reclaimed

08:58.834 --> 09:01.751
I'll not play a note of music

09:01.792 --> 09:02.709
Otherwise

09:02.751 --> 09:04.001
Otherwise what?

09:05.001 --> 09:05.959
I'll cut off my finger

09:06.417 --> 09:07.667
to prove my resolve

09:16.417 --> 09:18.417
An impressive vow to Heaven

09:20.209 --> 09:21.917
But I am the Heaven of Pei

09:22.417 --> 09:24.417
I've asked you to play

09:24.876 --> 09:27.417
Will you not obey me?

09:29.417 --> 09:30.209
Fine then

09:30.626 --> 09:31.542
Don't play today

09:31.959 --> 09:33.334
Take them away

09:33.376 --> 09:34.542
Come

09:34.584 --> 09:35.709
No

09:37.751 --> 09:38.792
They will play

09:38.834 --> 09:39.959
Then I won't listen

10:09.917 --> 10:10.959
Commander

10:12.001 --> 10:13.542
Madam is ready for you

10:37.876 --> 10:39.126
Madam's vow

10:42.001 --> 10:43.667
is mine as well

10:48.167 --> 10:49.459
I'll cut my hair

10:50.667 --> 10:51.959
to beg Heaven's forgiveness

10:52.251 --> 10:53.334
Commander, don't

10:53.792 --> 10:54.709
Commander, don't

10:54.751 --> 10:56.042
Don't do this

11:02.959 --> 11:04.626
Alright, don't play then

11:05.459 --> 11:07.209
No need to make a scene

11:08.167 --> 11:09.334
We'll take our leave

11:21.292 --> 11:24.584
Sire, why did you insist that Commander play?

11:25.501 --> 11:27.584
I was just trying to

11:27.626 --> 11:29.209
deflate his arrogance

11:30.251 --> 11:33.709
I'll have to clean up his mess

11:35.001 --> 11:38.126
There's only one option left

11:40.959 --> 11:43.167
Yang's son, Ping

11:43.584 --> 11:45.209
has not yet married, right?

11:45.751 --> 11:47.501
Sire means to say...

11:48.917 --> 11:51.084
Marry off my wild sister

11:52.167 --> 11:54.917
Shouldn't we ask if she's willing?

11:54.959 --> 11:56.459
I'm her elder brother

11:56.792 --> 11:58.001
No need to ask

11:59.667 --> 12:01.834
You must make Yang understand:

12:02.209 --> 12:04.542
Commander doesn't represent me

12:05.667 --> 12:09.209
We don't intend to take back Jing

12:09.251 --> 12:11.084
Much less start a war

12:13.209 --> 12:14.584
My proposal

12:15.042 --> 12:16.917
will show my sincerity

12:17.376 --> 12:18.459
All right

12:18.501 --> 12:20.042
I'll choose a good day

12:20.084 --> 12:21.584
to go make the proposal

12:21.917 --> 12:22.751
You may leave

12:22.792 --> 12:23.709
Yes, Sire

13:27.209 --> 13:28.584
To play as one

13:28.626 --> 13:30.167
Two hearts must beat as one

13:30.792 --> 13:33.251
As is the case with you and Madam

13:33.584 --> 13:35.626
I haven't even dared to practice

13:36.126 --> 13:37.417
I deserve to die

13:38.709 --> 13:40.334
Had you been exposed

13:40.792 --> 13:42.542
You would indeed deserve to die

13:42.834 --> 13:45.751
We'd both deserve to die

13:46.292 --> 13:48.876
You must master the zither

13:49.667 --> 13:52.959
and suffer this cut

13:53.501 --> 13:54.626
Commander

13:55.001 --> 13:56.334
Please proceed

14:11.417 --> 14:12.876
These herbs are harsh

14:13.959 --> 14:16.584
In an hour

14:16.626 --> 14:18.584
The wound will rot

14:18.626 --> 14:20.209
and look just like mine

14:28.792 --> 14:30.084
Whatever you're holding in...

14:30.167 --> 14:31.542
let it out, you'll feel better

14:32.001 --> 14:33.001
Let it out!

14:33.376 --> 14:36.501
When I was 8 I strayed from my mother

14:36.542 --> 14:38.376
and drifted, lost, through Jing City

14:39.251 --> 14:40.626
I passed out from hunger

14:40.959 --> 14:42.876
Your uncle happened to pass by

14:45.709 --> 14:50.417
I'll never forget that bowl of rice...

14:52.167 --> 14:53.626
I've been here over 20 years...

14:55.292 --> 14:56.709
Your days here

14:56.709 --> 14:58.626
have indeed been hard

14:59.292 --> 15:03.834
I owe you both my deepest gratitude

15:04.917 --> 15:06.751
Uncle was a cruel man

15:07.834 --> 15:10.126
Every time you tried to escape

15:10.167 --> 15:12.542
he beat you so hard you passed out

15:14.376 --> 15:15.667
This place

15:17.292 --> 15:19.084
is your prison, your cage

15:22.251 --> 15:23.501
Press on it for me

15:32.001 --> 15:33.417
And after he died

15:34.501 --> 15:36.792
I put you through such brutal training

15:37.292 --> 15:39.167
You must hate me for it

15:41.334 --> 15:42.667
How could I hate you?

15:44.042 --> 15:45.959
I'd be willing to die in pieces

15:46.751 --> 15:49.417
to repay your gracious kindness

15:50.376 --> 15:53.167
It's Yang who should die in pieces

15:56.917 --> 15:58.334
If you kill him

15:58.459 --> 16:00.334
I'll let you go home

16:27.584 --> 16:28.667
My Husband

16:31.251 --> 16:34.084
Uncle was so right to choose you

16:34.792 --> 16:36.667
Besides looking just like me

16:37.126 --> 16:40.834
you're incredibly quick-witted

16:41.334 --> 16:44.334
Since making your debut a year ago

16:44.709 --> 16:46.709
you've been so good you've fooled them all

16:49.917 --> 16:51.376
Sometimes I even wonder

16:52.292 --> 16:55.126
if my wife can still tell us apart?

17:05.834 --> 17:07.334
I've found your mother

17:11.541 --> 17:12.666
My mother

17:15.791 --> 17:17.084
She's still alive?

17:17.501 --> 17:19.709
She's still right there in Jing

17:21.166 --> 17:24.126
Wandering homeless in the streets

17:25.041 --> 17:27.376
I've bought your old house

17:28.917 --> 17:30.001
Had everything set up

17:30.042 --> 17:31.251
She's settled in there now

17:31.542 --> 17:33.042
How did you find her?

17:33.459 --> 17:34.751
Does she know I'm still alive?

17:49.376 --> 17:51.084
So you have a huge stake

17:52.001 --> 17:53.584
in this battle

17:55.001 --> 17:56.501
After Jing's taken

17:56.792 --> 18:00.584
you two can reunite

18:18.167 --> 18:19.626
Your zither needs tuning

18:27.751 --> 18:29.334
Yours is in the major key

18:29.376 --> 18:30.709
The strings need tightening

18:47.792 --> 18:48.834
Thank you

21:32.376 --> 21:33.459
You can go

21:47.917 --> 21:49.209
You've got just four hours

21:50.001 --> 21:51.626
to put this ointment on the wound

21:51.667 --> 21:52.959
You can't be a moment late

22:01.667 --> 22:03.001
Your husband

22:03.042 --> 22:04.876
is the most noble,

22:04.876 --> 22:06.167
most strategic,

22:06.167 --> 22:08.084
most admired man in Pei

22:09.042 --> 22:10.542
And I?

22:10.542 --> 22:12.126
But I'm nothing but a servant

22:12.751 --> 22:14.084
Nothing more than his shadow

22:14.792 --> 22:16.167
You're not a shadow

22:18.542 --> 22:19.667
You are you

22:19.667 --> 22:21.501
Who am I then?

22:26.917 --> 22:28.376
You were born in Jing

22:29.209 --> 22:30.626
You yearn to go home

22:33.542 --> 22:34.751
Maybe your mother

22:35.667 --> 22:37.542
is waiting at the lane's end

22:38.459 --> 22:40.334
Watching every passerby

22:41.001 --> 22:42.376
Waiting for your return

22:49.209 --> 22:50.501
Many years ago

22:52.667 --> 22:54.084
my mother went blind

22:54.792 --> 22:56.834
She couldn't even see me

22:58.042 --> 22:59.542
If she were waiting there

23:02.751 --> 23:03.959
she could only listen,

23:04.917 --> 23:07.876
straining to hear the sound of my steps

23:10.376 --> 23:11.792
No earlier, no later

23:13.417 --> 23:15.334
you've suddenly found her,

23:17.084 --> 23:20.042
just in time to ensure I'll obediently

23:20.084 --> 23:21.459
fight this battle for you

23:25.917 --> 23:27.709
You've kept me caged in secret

23:28.501 --> 23:30.209
Do you great, noble people

23:30.251 --> 23:31.626
know what scares me most?

23:32.959 --> 23:34.251
Darkness

23:36.001 --> 23:37.167
No one else

23:39.001 --> 23:40.126
No light

23:43.834 --> 23:45.126
No sound

23:45.876 --> 23:47.334
Only me in total darkness

23:48.251 --> 23:49.376
I'd touch everywhere

23:49.751 --> 23:50.792
Touch everything

23:51.792 --> 23:53.959
Rub every tiny crack in the wall

23:54.292 --> 23:56.042
To keep myself from going mad

23:56.709 --> 23:58.667
To prove to myself I was still alive

24:04.334 --> 24:10.584
And so you always sleep on the floor

24:12.126 --> 24:13.709
with the lamp lit all night

24:38.251 --> 24:39.959
It's time for you to go to Court

24:42.626 --> 24:45.626
"THE GREAT HALL OF PEI"

24:56.209 --> 24:57.917
Who wishes to speak?

25:03.417 --> 25:04.542
I, Sire

25:05.126 --> 25:06.126
Proceed

25:06.667 --> 25:08.709
I've disobeyed your commands

25:08.751 --> 25:10.292
Went to Jing and declared war

25:10.334 --> 25:11.917
Damaged the Alliance

25:12.334 --> 25:13.584
Please, Sire, punish me

25:13.626 --> 25:14.876
And the punishment?

25:15.001 --> 25:16.042
Beheading

25:17.709 --> 25:18.626
Brother

25:19.001 --> 25:20.376
You can't behead him

25:21.126 --> 25:22.709
Our Kingdom's great hero

25:22.751 --> 25:24.292
Our Great General

25:25.042 --> 25:26.459
You can't be beheaded

25:26.959 --> 25:28.584
How could we do without you?

25:29.376 --> 25:30.626
My dear Lu

25:31.917 --> 25:33.292
What do you think?

25:37.709 --> 25:39.167
He declared war on his own

25:39.209 --> 25:41.001
Put Pei at great risk

25:41.292 --> 25:42.667
A grave error indeed

25:43.042 --> 25:44.126
Lu

25:45.292 --> 25:46.209
All right

25:46.251 --> 25:47.292
Brother

25:49.251 --> 25:51.209
I hereby revoke Commander's powers

25:51.709 --> 25:53.167
Confiscate his sword and seals

25:53.917 --> 25:55.126
Henceforth he is a commoner

25:58.917 --> 26:00.001
No

26:01.751 --> 26:05.501
Sire...

26:12.876 --> 26:13.917
Do it

26:27.667 --> 26:31.501
I have no other choice

26:32.001 --> 26:34.001
You see this "Ode to Peace"?

26:35.001 --> 26:38.459
I wrote it and hung it here

26:38.876 --> 26:41.876
as a reminder to us all

26:41.917 --> 26:44.792
The Alliance is our lifeblood

26:45.459 --> 26:47.167
Anyone who violates it,

26:47.209 --> 26:49.542
lord or subject, will pay the price

26:50.251 --> 26:53.501
We will always keep the peace

26:54.251 --> 26:58.292
Never speak of a war you can't win

26:59.334 --> 27:00.459
From this day on,

27:00.501 --> 27:02.834
anyone who speaks of this again

27:03.501 --> 27:04.709
will be instantly beheaded

27:05.042 --> 27:06.834
Thank you for sparing my life

27:07.667 --> 27:08.834
I'm leaving

27:09.917 --> 27:11.251
Wait

27:14.459 --> 27:15.334
Brother

27:15.834 --> 27:16.792
What more do you want?

27:17.376 --> 27:18.709
Nothing

27:19.667 --> 27:20.792
I'm just holding court

27:28.459 --> 27:29.459
The Commander

27:29.501 --> 27:30.959
Has fought countless battles

27:31.501 --> 27:33.001
and suffered many wounds

27:33.959 --> 27:35.501
But the one

27:35.542 --> 27:37.167
that concerns me most

27:37.917 --> 27:39.792
is the wound from Yang's saber

27:40.417 --> 27:43.167
A wound few could recover from

27:43.834 --> 27:44.876
Indeed, yes

27:45.667 --> 27:47.667
It still hasn't healed

27:49.251 --> 27:50.959
I've found a rare ointment

27:51.417 --> 27:52.751
that can heal your wound

27:55.626 --> 27:56.834
After you leave today,

27:57.292 --> 28:00.917
who knows when we'll meet again?

28:01.792 --> 28:04.084
I want to see you've used this

28:04.417 --> 28:05.667
so I'll know you'll be alright

28:08.167 --> 28:10.417
Why trouble yourself with this?

28:10.876 --> 28:12.084
I'll go back and have my wife...

28:12.084 --> 28:13.459
As I said

28:16.667 --> 28:18.542
I want to apply it myself

28:37.251 --> 28:38.709
Commander's wound

28:38.917 --> 28:40.167
is Pei's as well

28:40.792 --> 28:42.584
Should any of you prove as loyal

28:43.042 --> 28:45.001
I would serve you the same way

28:57.042 --> 28:58.042
Commander

28:59.209 --> 29:00.626
This wound

29:01.876 --> 29:03.709
looks fresh

29:13.584 --> 29:15.001
You're trying to trick me

29:15.792 --> 29:18.792
I beg Sire's punishment

29:20.959 --> 29:22.459
My old wound has healed

29:23.417 --> 29:24.667
This cut

29:25.667 --> 29:27.001
was self-inflicted

29:28.834 --> 29:32.001
My loss to Yang is my greatest shame

29:33.709 --> 29:35.959
This cut is a reminder that

29:36.501 --> 29:38.042
as long as Yang lives,

29:38.751 --> 29:40.792
my wound will never heal

29:41.792 --> 29:43.334
Until we reclaim Jing

29:43.667 --> 29:46.209
how can we speak of peace?

29:46.251 --> 29:47.334
How dare you

29:48.792 --> 29:50.751
brazenly resist my orders?

29:51.334 --> 29:53.209
I'm a commoner now

29:53.876 --> 29:56.917
I'll have my duel with Yang

29:58.001 --> 29:59.542
Why should that concern you?

30:53.792 --> 30:55.084
At Court today

30:55.126 --> 30:56.417
the King suddenly challenged him

30:56.876 --> 30:58.751
He handled it well despite the scare

30:59.376 --> 31:01.001
Quite impressive

31:04.626 --> 31:05.959
He's good

31:07.584 --> 31:10.209
But no one could tell that wound is new

31:12.292 --> 31:14.334
The King was testing him

31:21.042 --> 31:22.876
My "Ode to Peace"

31:23.501 --> 31:25.834
is quite well-written

31:25.876 --> 31:27.626
Why did you demote Commander?

31:37.001 --> 31:37.959
So tell me

31:39.417 --> 31:42.959
Why'd he have to go cut himself?

31:45.292 --> 31:46.834
Why bother?

31:46.876 --> 31:48.459
To remember the shame of defeat

31:48.876 --> 31:50.292
It was an honorable act

31:51.292 --> 31:52.417
He's not like you

31:52.834 --> 31:54.292
You wouldn't dare retake Jing

31:54.334 --> 31:55.542
All you do is compromise

31:55.959 --> 31:57.334
You've become a pitiful joke

31:58.251 --> 31:59.876
I do this all for Pei

32:00.459 --> 32:01.917
You think I don't know you?

32:02.709 --> 32:04.209
You do things only for your throne

32:08.376 --> 32:10.084
Fine, for my throne...

32:12.751 --> 32:15.417
Which has never been safe for a day

32:25.792 --> 32:27.584
Legend says Yang's Great Saber

32:27.626 --> 32:29.542
was forged by a master blacksmith

32:29.959 --> 32:31.626
on a night of a full moon

32:32.709 --> 32:35.751
It's destined to take hundreds of lives

32:35.792 --> 32:37.167
as offerings to the Saber God

32:37.626 --> 32:38.917
It weighs 40 kilos

32:39.501 --> 32:40.876
Glows in the night

32:40.917 --> 32:42.251
Glints cold in the day

32:42.459 --> 32:43.792
And kills in three rounds

33:02.167 --> 33:03.167
Round One

33:03.209 --> 33:04.459
You're not focused

33:08.126 --> 33:10.167
Your mind is elsewhere

33:34.792 --> 33:36.709
Round Two...

33:38.751 --> 33:39.584
My dear Husband

33:39.959 --> 33:41.126
You need to stop

33:42.251 --> 33:43.084
Again

33:44.126 --> 33:45.542
I fear your strength won't hold

33:45.792 --> 33:46.876
Why worry?

33:47.542 --> 33:49.251
It's either you or me

33:49.751 --> 33:50.626
Come on

34:30.083 --> 34:31.001
Round Three

34:31.417 --> 34:33.876
That was exactly the blow

34:34.542 --> 34:35.958
I took from Yang that day

34:37.958 --> 34:41.251
Though I used only half its force,

34:41.876 --> 34:43.583
you're already done for

34:47.501 --> 34:48.417
My dear Husband

34:48.708 --> 34:49.708
I'll help you up

34:57.834 --> 35:00.584
Your mind's elsewhere

35:01.167 --> 35:02.334
A distracted mind

35:02.334 --> 35:03.959
means shaky breathing

35:04.584 --> 35:05.792
Shaky breathing

35:05.792 --> 35:07.417
means no firm steps

35:08.167 --> 35:09.292
How will you survive

35:09.292 --> 35:10.667
without firm steps?

35:14.751 --> 35:16.751
Have you forgotten who you are?

35:17.167 --> 35:18.292
Tell me

35:18.292 --> 35:19.417
Who are you?

35:20.667 --> 35:21.584
Jing

35:21.626 --> 35:22.751
What?

35:23.376 --> 35:24.917
Jing

35:26.459 --> 35:28.209
You named me after Jing City

35:28.626 --> 35:32.417
so I'd never forget our great cause

35:36.959 --> 35:40.834
I only need you because I'm dying

35:43.501 --> 35:46.126
Focus on your task

35:46.834 --> 35:48.626
Forget everything else

36:24.792 --> 36:26.792
Strokes with rhythm

36:27.292 --> 36:29.167
Words that dance

36:30.126 --> 36:31.834
My unique style

36:33.209 --> 36:34.209
How exquisite

36:34.251 --> 36:35.209
Wonderful

36:35.251 --> 36:36.667
Superb calligraphy

36:36.709 --> 36:37.876
Truly great

36:49.751 --> 36:50.709
Sister

36:52.167 --> 36:53.626
Look at the "Pei" I wrote

36:54.376 --> 36:55.501
What do you think?

37:02.292 --> 37:04.001
Lu is here

37:06.667 --> 37:08.417
Leave

37:13.376 --> 37:14.376
Humbly reporting

37:14.917 --> 37:16.417
How was your trip to Jing?

37:16.792 --> 37:17.751
Sire

37:17.792 --> 37:19.209
The Yangs have been told

37:19.251 --> 37:20.542
of your marriage proposal

37:20.584 --> 37:21.834
They are quite pleased

37:22.376 --> 37:23.209
Good

37:23.834 --> 37:24.834
Good

37:25.167 --> 37:26.251
Brother

37:26.292 --> 37:27.334
Who's getting married?

37:29.584 --> 37:30.751
You

37:31.834 --> 37:33.626
Without even telling me?

37:33.667 --> 37:34.626
What do you think I am?

37:35.167 --> 37:36.917
A single marriage

37:36.959 --> 37:38.334
to make peace between two nations

37:39.376 --> 37:40.542
You're the Princess

37:41.084 --> 37:42.709
You should understand this

37:42.751 --> 37:43.626
I won't do it

37:43.959 --> 37:45.042
Go yourself

37:48.376 --> 37:49.667
Continue

37:52.126 --> 37:52.876
However

37:52.917 --> 37:56.209
To thank them for protecting the City,

37:56.251 --> 37:57.167
the King of YAN has offered his daughter

37:57.209 --> 37:58.667
to Yang's son, Ping

37:58.959 --> 38:01.834
They can't refuse

38:02.167 --> 38:03.542
So... what do we do?

38:04.334 --> 38:06.542
Well, Ping has an idea

38:06.917 --> 38:07.834
Which is...?

38:08.667 --> 38:10.042
Sire, may I

38:10.084 --> 38:11.417
brief you privately?

38:11.459 --> 38:12.501
What are you afraid of?

38:12.792 --> 38:13.626
Speak

38:14.042 --> 38:15.292
Sire

38:15.334 --> 38:16.209
It's...

38:18.084 --> 38:19.042
Everyone here

38:19.376 --> 38:21.167
has risked his life for me

38:21.209 --> 38:22.459
In front of these men

38:22.501 --> 38:24.251
there can be no secrets

38:27.459 --> 38:28.792
Ping proposes

38:29.376 --> 38:31.126
to take Princess as a concubine,

38:31.542 --> 38:32.667
thus fulfilling everyone's wishes

38:46.376 --> 38:47.542
Well that's...

38:48.542 --> 38:50.334
also a way...

38:51.501 --> 38:53.501
Ping has offered

38:53.542 --> 38:54.792
his personal dagger

38:54.834 --> 38:56.584
as an engagement gift

38:57.001 --> 38:58.542
Provided Sire does not object,

38:58.584 --> 39:00.209
the marriage is confirmed

39:02.126 --> 39:03.376
Kill

39:04.084 --> 39:06.042
Kill those damn Yangs

39:07.417 --> 39:08.167
Sire

39:08.209 --> 39:09.542
Give me 30,000 soldiers

39:09.584 --> 39:11.126
I'll bathe Jing in blood

39:11.167 --> 39:12.292
Sire

39:12.334 --> 39:13.042
Seize Jing City

39:13.084 --> 39:14.709
Hack the Yangs to pieces

39:14.751 --> 39:15.459
Win Jing back

39:15.501 --> 39:17.001
Don't you dare

39:18.292 --> 39:19.792
Have you forgotten my order?

39:20.417 --> 39:22.709
Those who talk of taking Jing

39:22.751 --> 39:23.917
shall be beheaded

39:26.001 --> 39:26.917
Sire

39:26.959 --> 39:28.417
This is spineless

39:28.459 --> 39:29.459
Humiliating

39:29.501 --> 39:31.001
Our Kingdom will perish

39:31.042 --> 39:31.876
under your reign

39:31.917 --> 39:33.042
Tian, how dare you

39:33.251 --> 39:34.334
defy the King

39:34.376 --> 39:35.292
Drag him out

39:35.334 --> 39:36.376
Strip him of his rank

39:36.751 --> 39:37.834
Guards

39:39.126 --> 39:40.167
I'll do it

39:57.709 --> 39:59.334
How dare he be so insolent

39:59.709 --> 40:00.459
Sire

40:00.501 --> 40:02.209
Does he still see you as his King?

40:05.709 --> 40:06.834
Clownish King

40:10.459 --> 40:11.626
Sire, Tian's words

40:12.001 --> 40:13.959
amount to rebellion

40:27.876 --> 40:29.376
Don't trouble yourself, Sire

40:34.334 --> 40:35.209
You...

40:36.084 --> 40:37.167
Sire

40:47.626 --> 40:48.667
Step aside

40:48.792 --> 40:49.876
Princess

40:49.917 --> 40:50.917
Step aside

41:01.542 --> 41:02.792
I'll accept the gift

41:03.334 --> 41:04.709
Tell him I agree

41:10.126 --> 41:13.126
"JING PRACTICE GROUNDS"

41:48.917 --> 41:50.917
You forced me back two steps

41:51.459 --> 41:52.584
Good tactic, son

41:54.251 --> 41:55.292
We Yangs are known for

41:55.834 --> 41:59.667
force, speed and death in three rounds

42:00.376 --> 42:02.126
But responding nimbly to

42:02.167 --> 42:03.542
a master fighter's moves

42:03.584 --> 42:05.459
is the true essence of our technique

42:06.167 --> 42:07.542
Have you ever fought a true master?

42:09.084 --> 42:10.292
No, not yet

42:18.709 --> 42:19.959
When the Pei Commander visited

42:20.001 --> 42:21.251
what was your impression?

42:22.167 --> 42:23.209
Just as I'd envisioned him

42:23.751 --> 42:24.917
Distinguished and strong

42:25.876 --> 42:28.917
That crippling blow I'd given him...

42:29.917 --> 42:31.376
I was shocked to see

42:31.417 --> 42:33.459
he's recovered completely,

42:35.001 --> 42:35.959
good as new,

42:36.001 --> 42:38.834
poised and gracious as ever

42:39.626 --> 42:41.042
He'd come just to see you, Father

42:41.084 --> 42:42.542
He wouldn't dare give offense

42:45.584 --> 42:46.542
Ping

42:47.292 --> 42:49.626
You've proposed to take the Princess

42:49.667 --> 42:50.917
as your concubine

42:50.959 --> 42:52.292
Isn't that "giving offense"?

42:53.417 --> 42:55.376
I want them to give up trying

42:55.667 --> 42:56.917
to use a marriage

42:56.959 --> 42:58.417
to win Jing City back

42:59.792 --> 43:01.376
But I've just been told

43:01.417 --> 43:03.459
they've accepted your engagement gift

43:05.126 --> 43:07.376
Don't you think that's odd?

43:08.917 --> 43:10.167
So what?

43:11.084 --> 43:12.626
Their King dismissed their Commander

43:12.667 --> 43:13.751
Wounded Tian

43:14.167 --> 43:15.917
Forfeited two great generals

43:15.959 --> 43:17.209
They must all be demoralized

43:18.459 --> 43:19.584
And anyway

43:20.209 --> 43:22.292
If there's any sign of trouble there

43:22.334 --> 43:24.084
our spy will tell us right away,

43:24.709 --> 43:26.292
so there's no need to worry

43:26.334 --> 43:27.417
You're right

43:31.417 --> 43:32.251
Father

43:32.626 --> 43:34.167
Now that the City's stable

43:34.626 --> 43:36.084
His Majesty has again asked us

43:36.667 --> 43:37.751
to redeploy troops...

43:38.292 --> 43:39.834
The situation's quite tense there

43:40.334 --> 43:41.209
Let's do this

43:41.667 --> 43:43.209
Keep 800 soldiers here

43:43.251 --> 43:44.667
and send the remaining 30,000

43:44.709 --> 43:45.917
to support his Majesty

43:47.126 --> 43:48.417
Will we have enough left here?

43:49.917 --> 43:52.876
We have strong natural barriers...

43:53.417 --> 43:54.376
And in any case

43:54.917 --> 43:57.417
I and my saber are unbeatable

43:57.459 --> 43:58.626
800 will suffice

43:59.209 --> 44:00.251
Let me try

44:02.084 --> 44:03.376
I've often watched you

44:04.042 --> 44:05.626
I think I understand it

44:06.751 --> 44:07.709
Pei umbrellas

44:07.751 --> 44:09.167
are soft and flexible

44:09.542 --> 44:11.001
They work best in the rain

44:11.376 --> 44:12.709
They are water weapons

44:13.376 --> 44:14.626
Water is yin

44:15.001 --> 44:17.209
Yang's moves are hard and fierce

44:17.251 --> 44:18.417
Like fire

44:18.459 --> 44:19.376
Fire is yang

44:19.876 --> 44:21.126
Yin counters yang

44:21.167 --> 44:22.709
Water puts out fire

44:23.167 --> 44:24.251
And so

44:24.292 --> 44:26.292
Wield it with feminine moves

44:26.917 --> 44:27.876
What do you think?

44:28.709 --> 44:30.501
Feminine moves?

44:36.459 --> 44:38.126
I designed this taichi diagram

44:40.626 --> 44:42.334
Why haven't I thought of this?

44:46.917 --> 44:48.292
Watch us from the side

44:48.959 --> 44:50.084
Madam

44:50.126 --> 44:51.167
Come

45:18.042 --> 45:18.959
Madam

45:19.834 --> 45:21.251
Practice with Jing

45:21.876 --> 45:23.167
Teach him quickly

45:39.209 --> 45:40.334
What are you waiting for?

45:41.542 --> 45:44.042
If we don't find a way to beat Yang

45:44.084 --> 45:45.709
we'll have wasted all our efforts

45:59.167 --> 45:59.959
This will be another

46:01.209 --> 46:02.917
Yang-style saber round

46:03.542 --> 46:04.834
Hug tight together

46:05.709 --> 46:07.167
If our minds can meld as one

46:07.709 --> 46:09.376
you'll grasp the technique

46:10.709 --> 46:11.959
Quickly

46:15.126 --> 46:16.001
Madam

46:16.584 --> 46:17.709
Pardon me

47:19.584 --> 47:20.584
This is it

47:23.292 --> 47:24.292
This is it

47:25.001 --> 47:25.917
This is it

47:33.626 --> 47:35.001
This is it

47:39.084 --> 47:40.084
Get up

47:42.501 --> 47:44.251
Though Yang's attacks are fierce

47:44.292 --> 47:46.167
he loses stamina fast

47:47.876 --> 47:48.751
Jing

47:49.584 --> 47:51.251
If you apply Madam's technique

47:51.584 --> 47:52.917
you can kill him

47:53.251 --> 47:54.001
Yes

47:59.584 --> 48:01.167
There's someone you must go see

48:01.792 --> 48:02.876
You can leave now

48:03.417 --> 48:04.376
Yes

48:12.209 --> 48:13.792
Your hearts and minds

48:15.209 --> 48:17.209
were truly at one just now

48:18.792 --> 48:20.792
We were merely copying your moves...

48:21.917 --> 48:23.334
Why speak of hearts and minds?

48:24.709 --> 48:25.792
Can he win?

48:26.542 --> 48:28.209
Your technique

48:28.251 --> 48:29.834
can give Jing confidence

48:30.292 --> 48:32.417
He has to believe

48:32.459 --> 48:33.542
he can win

48:34.042 --> 48:35.917
in order to last three rounds

48:36.584 --> 48:38.001
And after three rounds?

48:38.959 --> 48:41.209
I'll just need an hour

49:19.542 --> 49:22.292
That lingering, echoing melody

49:22.334 --> 49:24.417
felt trapped, with no way out

49:24.459 --> 49:25.751
That must be

49:25.792 --> 49:27.792
how you're feeling, Sir

49:32.459 --> 49:34.459
You know what lies beyond the forest?

49:35.334 --> 49:37.042
100 convicts in hiding

49:37.876 --> 49:39.417
They live for fighting and killing

49:40.001 --> 49:42.251
yet look strangely gentle

49:43.542 --> 49:44.751
I've promised

49:44.792 --> 49:46.542
to let them go free if they reclaim Jing

49:48.292 --> 49:49.834
I brought them there to train,

49:49.876 --> 49:51.626
yet couldn't find a winning technique

49:52.292 --> 49:53.376
But now we have a way

49:53.417 --> 49:55.167
Learn it, train them

49:55.209 --> 49:56.751
Become their leader

49:57.459 --> 49:58.459
Yes, Sir

50:01.876 --> 50:03.042
Take this flute

50:03.084 --> 50:04.209
When you play it

50:04.251 --> 50:06.042
they'll know you've been sent by me

50:06.542 --> 50:07.959
and they'll obey you

50:08.584 --> 50:10.459
I'll do as you say, Commander

50:12.542 --> 50:13.667
Commander wants to see you

51:00.084 --> 51:01.042
Commander

51:04.209 --> 51:06.417
I'm neither man nor ghost

51:06.959 --> 51:09.042
Not the Commander you've known

51:09.376 --> 51:11.459
You will always be my Commander

51:16.834 --> 51:18.876
In the Mang River battle

51:19.792 --> 51:21.209
you killed a dozen men

51:22.292 --> 51:24.584
to save my life

51:25.209 --> 51:27.417
Suffered over twenty wounds

51:27.459 --> 51:30.292
Lay in a coma for three days

51:32.584 --> 51:35.167
My little cut is nothing

51:35.626 --> 51:37.001
Come

51:37.042 --> 51:37.959
Sit

51:39.917 --> 51:41.376
When I was eight

51:43.167 --> 51:44.751
On the first day of Spring

51:47.001 --> 51:48.209
Father

51:48.251 --> 51:49.667
was assassinated

51:50.376 --> 51:51.667
It happened in Court

51:53.667 --> 51:55.126
in front of all the ministers

51:55.167 --> 51:57.001
The killer

51:57.834 --> 51:59.292
cut his head off

51:59.334 --> 52:00.792
with an ax

52:02.542 --> 52:04.751
Uncle worried I'd meet the same fate

52:04.792 --> 52:07.001
He searched everywhere

52:08.001 --> 52:10.167
At last, in Jing City

52:10.209 --> 52:12.417
he found a boy my age

52:13.167 --> 52:15.501
who looked just like me

52:16.417 --> 52:19.542
He brought him here for secret training,

52:21.501 --> 52:25.834
hoping to shield me from palace intrigue

52:25.876 --> 52:27.542
To protect me

52:29.209 --> 52:31.834
That boy's become the "shadow"

52:33.417 --> 52:35.667
My wound worsened last year

52:36.209 --> 52:37.376
My health failed

52:37.417 --> 52:39.001
I suddenly aged

52:39.459 --> 52:41.667
No one is to know this...

52:41.709 --> 52:43.792
So you started using the Shadow

52:45.459 --> 52:46.626
But Madam, does she...

52:46.667 --> 52:47.959
Madam knows

52:51.209 --> 52:52.834
She pities him

52:54.001 --> 52:55.501
She's urged me

52:56.042 --> 52:57.626
to let him go home

52:59.709 --> 53:01.251
I called you here today

53:02.584 --> 53:04.167
so she can show you

53:04.209 --> 53:06.709
how to defeat Yang

53:07.209 --> 53:08.084
I see...

53:15.501 --> 53:17.667
That day the King inspected his wound...

53:18.292 --> 53:19.376
Did he already

53:19.959 --> 53:21.959
suspect he's a "shadow"?

53:24.834 --> 53:26.417
What do you think?

53:28.751 --> 53:29.709
Commander

53:30.334 --> 53:32.001
Why stay locked in this narrow cell

53:32.501 --> 53:34.792
trying to read the King's mind?

53:34.834 --> 53:36.292
Why not replace him

53:36.334 --> 53:37.417
and become our King?

53:37.834 --> 53:39.876
There's not a general or soldier

53:39.917 --> 53:41.459
who'd hesitate to support you

53:41.501 --> 53:42.459
What impudence!

53:42.751 --> 53:43.584
Sorry

53:44.667 --> 53:47.209
The King serves his purpose

53:50.542 --> 53:52.042
You

53:57.167 --> 53:58.167
are very good

54:00.834 --> 54:02.834
You've always been good

54:09.626 --> 54:11.042
To win Jing back

54:11.751 --> 54:13.167
I'll need three people

54:14.376 --> 54:15.626
One is the Shadow

54:16.251 --> 54:17.292
One the King

54:17.334 --> 54:19.501
And the third is you

54:20.792 --> 54:22.626
From this tiny cell

54:23.001 --> 54:24.542
I'll launch my scheme

54:25.084 --> 54:27.376
and watch you each play your part,

54:27.417 --> 54:28.959
reclaiming our land on my behalf

54:29.584 --> 54:31.084
Won't it be thrilling?

54:34.292 --> 54:35.792
And then?

54:37.209 --> 54:38.251
I will

54:38.292 --> 54:39.376
be King

54:42.292 --> 54:43.751
You'll be Commander

55:18.584 --> 55:19.626
Sorry

55:29.834 --> 55:31.459
You're more like the Commander

55:31.501 --> 55:32.834
than he is

55:33.417 --> 55:34.626
For a moment there

55:35.042 --> 55:37.251
I didn't know how to react

55:40.334 --> 55:41.876
I've been your Commander

55:43.126 --> 55:44.876
I'll still be your Commander

55:46.167 --> 55:47.501
That's all there is

56:19.126 --> 56:20.876
Yang's saber technique

56:20.917 --> 56:22.376
is hard and strong

56:22.959 --> 56:23.667
Wield your umbrellas

56:23.709 --> 56:26.084
with feminine moves

56:26.126 --> 56:28.126
Borrow the slickness of the rain

56:28.167 --> 56:29.584
Using yin to counter yang

56:30.001 --> 56:32.001
is our only way to win

56:34.001 --> 56:35.542
Nonstop clouds and rain

56:35.917 --> 56:37.459
We'll win when the waters rise

56:38.584 --> 56:40.417
It's rained for four days

56:40.959 --> 56:42.417
If it rains for three more

56:42.459 --> 56:44.042
the river water will rise

56:44.084 --> 56:46.292
and submerge Jing's storm drain

56:50.001 --> 56:52.792
Commander rightly chose this moment for the duel

56:53.042 --> 56:54.292
Whatever happens, win or lose

56:54.376 --> 56:56.042
The moment has arrived

56:56.417 --> 56:57.834
False, true

56:57.876 --> 56:59.584
True, false

57:00.251 --> 57:01.459
just like in a game of chess

57:04.751 --> 57:05.917
But who, after all

57:06.417 --> 57:08.126
are the pawns?

57:09.417 --> 57:10.959
So turning me into a concubine

57:13.917 --> 57:15.251
was also a move in your game?

57:15.292 --> 57:16.959
Just an improvised ploy,

57:17.001 --> 57:19.001
a decoy move

57:19.042 --> 57:20.376
And the real move, then?

57:21.001 --> 57:22.709
Tell me then, what is real?

57:30.792 --> 57:31.876
To tomorrow

57:32.542 --> 57:33.792
To a swift victory

57:44.959 --> 57:46.542
You left home so young

57:47.084 --> 57:48.917
Do you know your way back?

57:50.251 --> 57:51.376
I think so

57:52.917 --> 57:54.917
You'll be able to find it?

58:00.792 --> 58:03.501
They say a pup taken at birth

58:04.542 --> 58:05.917
can find its birthplace

58:06.376 --> 58:08.167
by tracing the scent

58:11.084 --> 58:13.126
I've been yearning to return

58:14.251 --> 58:15.626
I know I can find it

58:19.042 --> 58:20.459
Actually

58:22.209 --> 58:24.126
I also long to go home

58:30.626 --> 58:32.501
But isn't Pei your home?

58:35.792 --> 58:37.709
Home has many meanings

58:46.417 --> 58:47.417
Jing

58:50.667 --> 58:51.959
To a swift victory

59:17.292 --> 59:18.334
I know

59:19.834 --> 59:21.209
I can't win tomorrow

59:26.417 --> 59:27.501
Actually

59:30.126 --> 59:32.209
You've had many chances to refuse

59:33.459 --> 59:35.001
You could have run away

59:38.417 --> 59:39.459
Why didn't you?

59:40.709 --> 59:42.709
You've always seemed so obedient

59:44.084 --> 59:45.917
So willing to do this

59:48.251 --> 59:49.459
Because of you

59:52.084 --> 59:53.126
When I was young

59:53.167 --> 59:54.876
I was being forced

59:56.501 --> 59:57.751
But since I've grown older

59:58.501 --> 59:59.542
and come to know you

59:59.584 --> 01:00:01.084
I've only had one thing in mind

01:00:02.084 --> 01:00:03.626
I would do

01:00:04.292 --> 01:00:06.084
anything for you

01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:16.751
In tomorrow's fight

01:00:17.126 --> 01:00:18.709
I'll be just a decoy

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:25.126
No one cares whether a decoy lives or dies

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.417
I care

01:00:44.876 --> 01:00:46.292
Tonight

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.959
is the last you'll spend here

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:55.001
Yes

01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:23.251
Madam

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:27.292
Thank you

01:05:05.042 --> 01:05:06.001
Reporting to General Yang

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:07.792
The Pei Commander has arrived alone

01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:09.167
Says he's come as agreed

01:05:26.876 --> 01:05:29.876
"JING CITY PASS"

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:02.959
Father

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.042
How'd the ship slip through so easily?

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:10.626
Some sort of cheap trick

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:29.167
General Yang

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:33.292
Our foolish King has dismissed me

01:06:34.542 --> 01:06:35.667
I've no power

01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:37.251
No soldiers

01:06:37.959 --> 01:06:39.667
Honor our gentlemen's agreement

01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:41.542
Duel with this commoner

01:06:42.042 --> 01:06:43.626
to see who prevails

01:06:48.626 --> 01:06:49.584
Father

01:06:50.042 --> 01:06:51.459
Something seems odd

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:54.167
That's a taichi diagram on the deck

01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:55.959
It could be a trap

01:06:57.376 --> 01:06:58.667
It's just hocus-pocus

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:00.792
I'm curious to see

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.376
what game he's playing

01:07:03.792 --> 01:07:05.292
I know you've agreed to do this

01:07:05.334 --> 01:07:06.542
But you should still be cautious

01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:08.501
How about bringing a few soldiers?

01:07:10.167 --> 01:07:11.792
We two have a gentlemen's agreement

01:07:12.292 --> 01:07:13.667
He's come alone

01:07:13.709 --> 01:07:14.917
If I bring soldiers

01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:16.501
won't I look like a fool?

01:07:16.876 --> 01:07:17.751
My saber

01:07:21.251 --> 01:07:22.251
Father

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:23.876
Please be careful

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.167
Guard the Pass

01:07:27.584 --> 01:07:28.709
Protect the banner

01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:30.792
Yes, Sir

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:32.042
I'll guard it with my life

01:07:33.751 --> 01:07:36.917
Watch how I teach him a lesson

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:19.376
Go

01:08:36.792 --> 01:08:37.876
Princess?

01:08:39.501 --> 01:08:40.667
Princess

01:09:36.792 --> 01:09:37.959
This is a Pei umbrella

01:09:38.834 --> 01:09:40.584
made specially for this duel

01:09:41.126 --> 01:09:42.376
I humbly request the General's

01:09:42.876 --> 01:09:44.292
teaching and guidance

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:12.792
Round One

01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:16.709
I can see

01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:19.667
you've taken great pains to prepare

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.667
I couldn't dare do otherwise

01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:49.292
Round Two

01:12:06.042 --> 01:12:07.001
Each man's crossbow

01:12:07.042 --> 01:12:08.501
has only 12 arrows

01:12:08.542 --> 01:12:10.292
So move right through, don't bog down

01:13:28.667 --> 01:13:29.542
Young General

01:13:29.584 --> 01:13:30.667
There are enemies in the City

01:13:39.001 --> 01:13:41.167
Remove crossbows

01:13:44.626 --> 01:13:47.126
Open umbrellas

01:13:54.042 --> 01:13:55.126
Fire

01:14:01.542 --> 01:14:02.417
Block

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.042
Ping

01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:16.126
Round Three...

01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:17.667
Well done

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:22.876
Never in our family's history

01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:24.209
has anyone

01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:25.376
survived three rounds

01:15:25.417 --> 01:15:26.626
against the Yang saber

01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:30.209
Not bad

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:31.876
I'll save face for you

01:15:31.917 --> 01:15:32.917
Let's call it a draw

01:15:32.959 --> 01:15:34.084
and stop here

01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:42.001
Let's go again

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:43.834
We agreed to duel

01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:45.709
to determine a winner

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:47.501
If we keep going now

01:15:48.084 --> 01:15:49.709
it will be for life or death

01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:51.251
Come

01:16:06.376 --> 01:16:07.959
Jing City is taken

01:17:40.959 --> 01:17:42.292
Why doesn't a girl like you

01:17:42.542 --> 01:17:43.792
stay home where you belong?

01:17:44.584 --> 01:17:45.876
Did you come looking to die?

01:17:47.042 --> 01:17:48.501
You've insulted me

01:17:49.584 --> 01:17:50.709
Insulted you?

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:52.584
I don't even know you

01:17:55.209 --> 01:17:57.042
Said you'd make me your concubine

01:18:01.459 --> 01:18:02.417
That was you?

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.667
I...

01:18:12.751 --> 01:18:14.417
I'm here to give this back to you

01:18:15.501 --> 01:18:16.417
What?

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:32.834
Dear Wife

01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:35.792
Using the Shadow

01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:37.959
Was I right, or wrong?

01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:41.459
Some things

01:19:42.501 --> 01:19:43.751
don't have a right or wrong

01:19:45.751 --> 01:19:47.251
What's done is done

01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:08.376
Dear Husband

01:20:10.126 --> 01:20:11.126
Here, now

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:14.459
Let's play our music together

01:21:18.626 --> 01:21:21.709
Jing is taken

01:21:30.251 --> 01:21:37.042
Jing is taken...

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:39.376
- Jing is taken...
- Ping

01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:06.584
Mother

01:25:34.084 --> 01:25:36.001
Commander promised to let me go

01:25:40.584 --> 01:25:42.709
Commander promised to let me go

01:26:33.751 --> 01:26:35.584
I've been ordered not to look at your face

01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:38.459
On whose order?

01:26:39.917 --> 01:26:41.001
The King's

01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:46.084
He's told me to ask:

01:26:46.667 --> 01:26:48.209
Would you like to go back?

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:56.417
Where is she?

01:27:00.167 --> 01:27:01.626
Where is she?

01:27:03.876 --> 01:27:05.209
Where is she?

01:27:12.584 --> 01:27:13.501
Sire

01:27:43.667 --> 01:27:44.751
Princess

01:27:45.626 --> 01:27:46.876
used Ping's dagger

01:27:47.792 --> 01:27:49.334
to kill him

01:28:45.126 --> 01:28:46.876
Today we celebrate

01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:51.084
the reclaiming of our homeland

01:28:55.001 --> 01:28:56.459
The first toast

01:28:57.584 --> 01:28:59.292
must go to Commander

01:29:03.376 --> 01:29:04.542
Please wait a moment

01:29:05.292 --> 01:29:06.959
Pei's great hero

01:29:08.417 --> 01:29:09.876
will arrive shortly

01:29:59.084 --> 01:30:00.042
As ordered by the King

01:30:00.084 --> 01:30:00.917
Behead him

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:17.126
Commander has arrived...

01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:18.709
Sire

01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:19.876
Commander has arrived

01:30:20.626 --> 01:30:22.001
Welcome our Commander

01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:10.042
Humbly

01:31:11.584 --> 01:31:13.042
reporting to Sire

01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:17.126
You've fought hard and well

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:18.959
Please rise

01:31:19.001 --> 01:31:20.542
and be seated next to Madam

01:31:21.292 --> 01:31:22.876
Thank you, Sire

01:31:55.417 --> 01:31:56.376
Madam

01:31:59.709 --> 01:32:00.834
You're back...

01:32:03.042 --> 01:32:04.042
Yes

01:32:10.209 --> 01:32:11.917
Today Pei

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:13.334
has retaken Jing City

01:32:13.876 --> 01:32:16.626
Our Kingdom rejoices

01:32:17.042 --> 01:32:18.376
Per the King's order

01:32:18.417 --> 01:32:19.917
the first toast

01:32:19.959 --> 01:32:21.876
goes to Commander

01:32:22.501 --> 01:32:24.084
Let's drink another day

01:32:24.209 --> 01:32:25.292
You may all leave now

01:32:25.792 --> 01:32:26.709
The King orders

01:32:26.751 --> 01:32:30.292
all to withdraw...

01:32:46.292 --> 01:32:47.376
Dear Lu

01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:51.959
You stay

01:33:13.209 --> 01:33:14.042
Come

01:33:14.792 --> 01:33:15.626
Take it

01:33:19.292 --> 01:33:22.334
To your achievements

01:33:23.959 --> 01:33:26.709
Know why I've kept promoting you?

01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:31.001
Treated you as my closest confidant?

01:33:32.584 --> 01:33:35.167
My deep gratitude for Sire's trust

01:33:36.376 --> 01:33:38.042
What trust?

01:33:39.584 --> 01:33:40.751
You

01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:43.251
have a special use

01:33:46.376 --> 01:33:48.209
Your secret reports to Yang

01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:51.167
made our victory possible

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:54.501
How much gold did he pay you?

01:34:20.292 --> 01:34:23.126
Surprised I killed him myself?

01:34:25.334 --> 01:34:28.084
It's because I'm truly happy

01:34:28.459 --> 01:34:29.792
When he conveyed my marriage offer

01:34:29.834 --> 01:34:31.542
Yang paid him a bribe, and he came back

01:34:32.001 --> 01:34:34.667
proposing my sister be made a concubine

01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:36.667
I don't care whose idea it was

01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:39.126
I had to take back that pound of flesh

01:34:51.209 --> 01:34:52.501
Now that you're back

01:34:53.126 --> 01:34:54.542
my mind is at ease

01:34:57.501 --> 01:34:58.459
You

01:34:59.042 --> 01:35:00.292
are a true talent

01:35:01.417 --> 01:35:03.167
Our Kingdom can't do without you

01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:10.959
Alike

01:35:12.001 --> 01:35:13.834
Very much alike

01:35:15.834 --> 01:35:17.376
Don't you agree?

01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:21.167
You know

01:35:22.167 --> 01:35:23.834
There's been one thing

01:35:23.876 --> 01:35:25.209
weighing on my mind

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:27.626
even more than retaking Jing

01:35:28.084 --> 01:35:30.459
It's been keeping me up at night

01:35:31.209 --> 01:35:34.292
But all I could do was wait...

01:35:37.626 --> 01:35:39.292
...wait for you

01:35:40.376 --> 01:35:41.834
You've won my city back for me

01:35:41.876 --> 01:35:45.209
Now let me do something for you

01:35:48.834 --> 01:35:50.334
There's no one here but us

01:35:51.084 --> 01:35:52.959
Let me put this simply

01:35:53.501 --> 01:35:54.959
A fake couple

01:35:55.001 --> 01:35:56.626
is no match for a real one

01:35:58.417 --> 01:36:00.834
I will make your wish come true

01:36:04.459 --> 01:36:06.126
And as for Commander

01:36:06.834 --> 01:36:09.251
He wants to be honored forever

01:36:09.292 --> 01:36:10.876
His wish will also come true

01:36:12.376 --> 01:36:13.834
A King's duty

01:36:14.251 --> 01:36:17.126
is to make men's dreams come true

01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:20.209
When we step out of this Hall

01:36:20.251 --> 01:36:21.376
the world

01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:23.501
will know only one Commander

01:36:25.376 --> 01:36:28.084
The obedient and loyal one

01:36:28.751 --> 01:36:31.126
You and I, King and Commander

01:36:31.167 --> 01:36:33.001
The two of us

01:36:33.751 --> 01:36:35.376
What do you say?

01:36:41.626 --> 01:36:43.792
I knew you'd come back

01:36:44.459 --> 01:36:46.626
Only a fool wouldn't have

01:36:52.501 --> 01:36:54.917
A young, vital husband

01:36:54.959 --> 01:36:56.334
at your side day and night

01:36:57.459 --> 01:36:59.126
What do you say, Madam?

01:37:17.292 --> 01:37:18.584
Good

01:37:20.834 --> 01:37:22.334
You've come just in time

01:37:23.251 --> 01:37:27.292
From now on I'll sleep well at night

01:37:29.126 --> 01:37:30.001
No

01:37:55.084 --> 01:37:56.542
Don't you want revenge?

01:37:59.542 --> 01:38:00.501
For years

01:38:00.876 --> 01:38:02.834
I've been misunderstood

01:38:04.417 --> 01:38:05.459
Finally

01:38:07.626 --> 01:38:09.751
we can both find relief

01:39:01.626 --> 01:39:03.376
Did you all expect

01:39:03.626 --> 01:39:04.959
my head

01:39:05.001 --> 01:39:07.292
to be in the box?

01:39:09.751 --> 01:39:11.959
There's something all in Pei know

01:39:13.417 --> 01:39:14.626
that only he

01:39:17.292 --> 01:39:19.042
never grasped

01:39:23.084 --> 01:39:24.126
It's I

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:27.792
who am the Heaven of Pei

01:39:34.376 --> 01:39:35.501
Without the real

01:39:35.542 --> 01:39:36.917
there can be no "shadow"

01:39:38.334 --> 01:39:40.542
A principle no one's understood

01:39:43.959 --> 01:39:44.876
You

01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:47.876
sent assassins to ambush me

01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:51.876
You had Jing's mother killed

01:39:51.917 --> 01:39:53.501
and put the blame on me

01:39:55.167 --> 01:39:56.626
How can someone so vile

01:39:57.167 --> 01:39:59.334
be King of Pei?

01:40:07.792 --> 01:40:08.751
Dear Husband...

01:40:08.792 --> 01:40:10.084
Never mind me

01:40:12.959 --> 01:40:14.751
I don't have much time left

01:40:15.084 --> 01:40:16.376
Leave all of this

01:40:17.626 --> 01:40:18.959
to me

01:40:21.167 --> 01:40:22.251
Jing

01:40:24.584 --> 01:40:25.584
Jing

01:40:28.917 --> 01:40:29.917
Kill him

01:40:30.376 --> 01:40:32.167
Avenge your mother

01:40:32.584 --> 01:40:34.626
Then take Madam with you

01:40:50.501 --> 01:40:52.417
I've spent my life

01:40:55.584 --> 01:40:58.751
on power games and war

01:41:00.792 --> 01:41:04.167
Never tasted the beauty of the world

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:07.917
Go live it for me

01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:11.876
Go

01:41:12.626 --> 01:41:14.459
The further the better

01:41:19.376 --> 01:41:20.667
Go

01:42:43.376 --> 01:42:44.459
Commander

01:42:46.876 --> 01:42:48.209
Without the real

01:42:49.084 --> 01:42:50.584
there is still a shadow

01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:53.626
You should have grasped this long ago

01:43:27.542 --> 01:43:28.501
Sire

01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:30.834
I'll summon the Palace doctor

01:43:32.292 --> 01:43:33.292
Stay calm

01:46:51.251 --> 01:46:52.959
An assassin attacked our King

01:46:53.792 --> 01:46:55.542
The King is dead

01:46:56.334 --> 01:46:58.209
I, your Commander

01:46:58.251 --> 01:47:00.001
Killed the assassin

01:47:00.042 --> 01:47:02.084
On the spot

01:47:03.305 --> 01:47:09.173
