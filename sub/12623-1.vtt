01:22.640 --> 01:24.995
<i>There has been a war
between orcs and humans</i>

01:25.080 --> 01:27.116
<i>for as long as
can be remembered.</i>

01:31.480 --> 01:35.871
<i>But there was once a time when we did
not even know who our enemy was.</i>

01:38.240 --> 01:42.472
<i>Or what that evil green magic,
the Fel, had done to us.</i>

01:54.480 --> 01:56.710
<i>But in the beginning,
how could we have known?</i>

01:58.120 --> 02:00.429
<i>What choice did we have?</i>

02:01.920 --> 02:03.558
<i>Our world was dying</i>

02:03.720 --> 02:06.951
<i>and I had to find
my clan a new home.</i>

02:15.320 --> 02:17.151
Durotan...

02:17.640 --> 02:19.835
I can feel your eyes.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.272
I thought you
were asleep.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.753
I was.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.077
Dreaming of a hunt

02:35.400 --> 02:36.992
through the snow.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.397
I've thought of a name.

02:47.240 --> 02:49.993
Well, keep it
to yourself, wife.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.511
I'll choose a name
when I meet him.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.514
Or her.

02:55.720 --> 02:56.720
Oh...

02:57.280 --> 03:00.272
And how will the great
Durotan name his son

03:01.600 --> 03:03.591
if I do not travel
with him?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.113
A son?

03:06.440 --> 03:08.749
Can you hide
your fat belly?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.590
Better than you can
hide your fat head.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.633
So many clans in
one place, Orgrim.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.032
Laughing Skull, Blackrock.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.474
All have been summoned.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.230
It will be a mighty warband.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.753
Just wonder who's
left to fight.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.398
Victory or death!

04:10.320 --> 04:11.912
Blackrock, over there.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.995
How much longer,
Blackhand?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.358
We are ready,
Gul'Dan.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.312
What did she say?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.036
She begs for you
to free her child.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.317
But I need him.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.192
I need all of them.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.550
Move, half-breed!

05:04.160 --> 05:05.229
What is that?

05:05.920 --> 05:07.717
Gul'Dan's magic.

05:19.080 --> 05:23.676
The fuel for my magic is life.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.033
We only have enough prisoners
to send through

05:27.200 --> 05:30.078
our strongest warriors.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.629
But that will be enough.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.234
The enemy is weak.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.753
When we arrive,

05:36.920 --> 05:40.390
we will take them as fuel!

05:44.440 --> 05:46.590
We will build a new portal!

05:46.760 --> 05:51.276
And when it is complete,
we will bring through

05:52.120 --> 05:53.951
all of the Horde!

06:49.080 --> 06:50.399
Let me go first.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.319
For the Horde!

07:56.800 --> 07:58.074
With child?

07:58.640 --> 08:01.791
You dare bring that
<i>wachook</i> into my warband?

08:04.200 --> 08:05.918
Let me go,
Blackhand!

08:06.080 --> 08:07.399
Draka!

08:22.080 --> 08:24.548
Push, little one. Push!

09:04.880 --> 09:07.917
A new warrior
for the Horde.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.635
Lothar.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.479
Come. I've got
something for you.

09:44.840 --> 09:45.989
What is it?

09:46.160 --> 09:48.196
A mechanical marvel.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.268
It's a boomstick.

09:56.320 --> 09:57.673
Odd.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.394
Take water.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.595
You might want to
head home, big man.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.434
Someone's attacked
one of your garrisons.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.833
Seems your king
needs you, Commander.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.115
An entire garrison,
and no one saw anything?

10:39.320 --> 10:40.639
We did find someone.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.473
He was searching the bodies
here in the barracks.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.639
In the barracks?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.874
Finally!
Are you in command?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.320
That's the mark of the Kirin Tor.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.354
What are you doing in
my city, spellchucker?

11:12.800 --> 11:15.837
Let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.072
Now, why would
I do that?

11:19.520 --> 11:22.398
Within that body is the
secret to your attacks.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.873
What was that?

11:45.400 --> 11:46.958
You must summon
the Guardian.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.360
Medivh?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.558
It should be he
who explains it.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.229
Only the King
summons the Guardian.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.473
Get him to Goldshire.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.234
What kind of beasts?

12:24.600 --> 12:26.296
Rumors, Your Majesty.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.834
How does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper?

12:28.920 --> 12:29.920
The Fel.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.871
Or at least
its influence.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.919
Is this him?

12:38.360 --> 12:39.360
Mmm-hmm.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.595
Your Majesty.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
Dad.

12:44.320 --> 12:45.355
Thank you, Sergeant.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.712
So, who are you, mage?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.310
My name is Khadgar.
I am the Guardian novitiate.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.032
I was.
I renounced my vows.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
You mean,
you're a fugitive?

12:56.920 --> 12:58.239
I'm not hiding.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
Your Majesty...

13:02.000 --> 13:05.037
I may have left my training,
but I didn't leave my abilities behind.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.948
I've sensed something.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.839
Dark forces, when it's strong,
it almost has a smell.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.231
Knowing that something so evil was
so close, I couldn't just ignore it.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.976
- Where has this happened?
- Is this true?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
What's going on
out there?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.196
Smoke, sir.
Southeast.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.753
Your Majesty, I urge you to engage the
Guardian with all haste.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.416
They've reached
Elwynn Forest.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.715
Grand Hamlet
is burning.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.515
An attack?

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
What?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.716
Stop requesting Callan.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.751
Stay out of my business.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.514
He wants to follow in
his father's footsteps.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.951
My son doesn't
need your help.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.270
Tread carefully.
You talk to your queen.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.029
You are my sister first.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.031
When was your last
visit to Karazhan?

14:00.200 --> 14:02.714
With you.
I don't know...

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
Six years.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.911
And you've had no contact
with Medivh since?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.638
Not for lack of trying.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.077
Well, he can't
hide from us now.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.558
The Guardian is summoned.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.440
Get on.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.719
Good luck.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.680
Okay!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.592
We need them alive!

15:06.800 --> 15:08.153
My baby!

15:08.320 --> 15:10.436
This is not
for a warrior.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.993
Let me go!

15:19.040 --> 15:20.996
Frostwolves do
not join the hunt?

15:24.560 --> 15:28.155
We prefer our enemies armed with an axe,
not a child.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.920
We have been
commanded, Durotan.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.638
Respect the old ways.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.834
There must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.508
Find them all!
Try not to kill too many,

15:42.680 --> 15:44.511
we need them alive.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.878
Lothar.

16:19.080 --> 16:20.195
Moroes.

16:21.040 --> 16:22.359
Look at you.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.992
You haven't aged a bit.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.118
Where is everyone?

16:35.280 --> 16:36.838
Many things have changed.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.195
The power that must be locked away here.
The knowledge.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.675
Where is he?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.316
I didn't know so
many books even existed.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
Wait here.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.431
And try not
to touch anything.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.959
He sees no one?

16:53.120 --> 16:54.872
World's been at peace.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.393
Good you are here,
Lothar.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.632
It will do the Guardian
a world of good

17:00.720 --> 17:03.757
to see a friendly face
beyond this old mug.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.313
He can't refuse you.

17:07.079 --> 17:08.273
Nor King Llane.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.713
Not if
he's summoned.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.354
Chop-chop.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.879
Did you summon
him, Moroes?

17:47.960 --> 17:50.758
No. He did not.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.278
So...

17:59.000 --> 18:01.195
You've become
a sculptor?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.956
I'm making a golem.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.398
Usually takes
years for the magic

18:06.560 --> 18:08.198
to seep into the clay,
but up here

18:09.240 --> 18:10.309
it's much faster.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.514
Make someone to
keep Moroes company.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.591
Help to clean up
around the house.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.034
Thank you.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.719
It's good
to see you, Lothar.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.835
We need your
guidance, Medivh.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.151
Our king summons you.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.876
Who's the boy downstairs?

18:43.960 --> 18:45.234
Hello?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.274
Guardian?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.552
Have a good look around?

19:48.680 --> 19:50.136
Get some ideas what
you're going to do

19:50.160 --> 19:51.513
with the place
once it's yours?

19:51.680 --> 19:52.680
Guardian,

19:52.840 --> 19:54.751
I renounced my vow.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.272
I didn't want
to come here.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.839
I swear, Guardian!

20:01.200 --> 20:03.430
I urged them to find you.
I told them.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.397
You should be
the one to explain.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.874
Explain what?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Fel!

20:12.520 --> 20:13.919
In Azeroth?

20:14.160 --> 20:15.160
In the barracks.

20:15.320 --> 20:16.469
One the bodies.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.631
Guardian,
what is the Fel?

20:20.160 --> 20:24.756
A magic unlike any other.
It feeds on life itself.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.276
It pollutes the user,
twisting everything it touches.

20:28.440 --> 20:32.433
It promises great power,
but it exacts a terrible price.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.999
There is no place
for the Fel in Azeroth.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.798
You've done
the right thing.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
We'll go.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.950
Hey! Go home, you.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.913
Step in.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.834
Medivh.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.315
Your Grace.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.039
It has been too long.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.800
Come.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.154
Help us get to the root of
these troubles of ours.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.953
What kind of beasts?

21:38.120 --> 21:40.076
They're saying giants.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.549
Armed giants,
wolves to carry them.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.472
Huge unstoppable monsters.

21:44.640 --> 21:45.914
What of the other
kingdoms?

21:46.080 --> 21:47.752
Are they suffering
the same?

21:47.920 --> 21:51.160
All seek our protection,
yet none trust us enough to tell us anything.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.757
We know nothing
about these so-called monsters.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.558
We need prisoners.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.358
Even a corpse would
tell us something.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.950
I don't know what
danger we're in, Medivh.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.869
I exist to protect
this realm, my lord.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.273
It is my very purpose.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.353
I am the Guardian.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.400
At least for
the time being, anyhow.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.440
Yes.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.672
What are we gonna
do about...

22:18.320 --> 22:19.435
What is his name?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.353
Khadgar, sire.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.679
He'll be coming with us.

22:27.840 --> 22:28.840
Well, then.

22:30.600 --> 22:31.794
We better get going.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.508
Halt.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.399
It can't be.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.280
Guardian?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.553
Close ranks!

23:47.720 --> 23:49.438
Watch your back!

23:59.160 --> 24:01.116
Watch your flank!
To your left!

24:09.920 --> 24:11.194
Watch your flanks!

24:15.280 --> 24:17.056
Watch your flank! To your left!

24:26.720 --> 24:27.994
Guardian!

24:48.120 --> 24:49.439
Die, you beast!

24:56.760 --> 24:58.512
Don't try and take them
on with brute force.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.840
They're stronger.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.757
Be smarter.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.793
The Fel.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.473
They're all dying!

25:47.120 --> 25:48.951
Only the green ones.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.633
Kill that big bastard.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.112
Durotan. Move.

26:12.560 --> 26:13.709
Guardian.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.349
Guardian,
what did you do?

26:16.600 --> 26:18.113
I was right, wasn't I?
It's here!

26:18.600 --> 26:19.635
Where are you going?

26:19.800 --> 26:21.836
Get these men
safely back to Stormwind.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.553
I have to return to Karazhan.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.509
You did well today.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.760
Where's the Guardian?

26:31.920 --> 26:32.989
Karazhan.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.160
We need a prisoner.
Where's your horse?

26:35.560 --> 26:36.560
They took my horse.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.359
Really? Just stay there.

27:04.880 --> 27:06.108
No!

28:22.960 --> 28:24.791
How much do you
love your master?

28:26.440 --> 28:27.839
I'll do it!

28:29.800 --> 28:31.153
Back off!

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
Pity.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.870
He would have
made a good coat.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.513
Over here!

29:07.720 --> 29:08.948
You took it alone?

29:09.120 --> 29:10.314
Yes.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.669
Looks like
the runt of the litter.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
You.

29:28.440 --> 29:31.352
What are you?
And why do you attack our lands?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.551
He does not know
what you speak.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.360
You speak our language?

29:40.360 --> 29:42.351
and I will wear your tongue!

29:54.200 --> 29:56.191
I will not warn you again!

30:01.040 --> 30:02.040
Tell him to stop.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.553
You tell him.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.879
You're welcome.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.757
Have you a name?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.596
You understand
our language.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.560
Again.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.439
Have you a name?

30:34.120 --> 30:35.314
Garona.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.471
She calls herself Garona.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.672
What kind
of being are you?

30:43.600 --> 30:45.750
She seems more like us
than those beasts we fought.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
Orc.

30:47.760 --> 30:48.909
Orc?

30:49.080 --> 30:52.356
That's what you are,
or the beast in the cage was?

30:54.680 --> 30:57.956
I know every race in the Seven Kingdoms.
I've never heard of "orc".

31:00.760 --> 31:02.512
Show me where
you come from?

31:08.440 --> 31:10.158
This is not orc world.

31:10.880 --> 31:11.949
Orc world is dead.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.272
Orcs take this world now.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.112
Not from this world?

31:17.640 --> 31:19.790
How did you get here?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.679
The Great Gate.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.960
Deep in ground...

31:24.120 --> 31:25.792
Into magic brought
us here.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.791
But how did you
learn our language?

31:28.480 --> 31:30.550
Orc take prisoner for the gate.
I learn from them.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
Prisoners?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.719
Our people?

31:34.400 --> 31:35.549
Are they alive?

31:35.720 --> 31:37.517
Yes. Many.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.874
Why?

31:39.080 --> 31:40.229
To feed the gate.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.153
To bring in the Horde.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.994
To take your world.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.275
You'll take us to them.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.595
No.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.472
You'll take us to them.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.313
Or you'll end up like
your friend in the cage.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.751
You think you're
fearsome?

32:00.160 --> 32:02.435
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.750
We're not trying to
be fearsome, Garona.

32:05.200 --> 32:08.033
We're trying to protect our people,
our families.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.398
If you help us,
I give you my oath,

32:12.200 --> 32:13.519
you will have
your freedom.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.194
Fearsome Blackhand,

32:21.960 --> 32:24.315
Warchief of the Horde.

32:25.160 --> 32:30.029
You have allowed the small-teeth
to kill your warriors.

32:31.000 --> 32:35.516
Worse, you've shamed your people
by running from an enemy.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.832
Are you too weak
to talk, Destroyer?

32:41.040 --> 32:44.191
The Horde has no
use for weakness.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.876
Respect our tradition,
Warchief.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.196
You know the penalty.

32:55.080 --> 32:57.230
Death!

32:59.280 --> 33:01.032
For the Horde!

33:02.360 --> 33:03.793
For the Horde!

33:05.560 --> 33:07.232
For the Horde!

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
For the Horde!

33:14.080 --> 33:15.080
Stop!

33:18.920 --> 33:21.673
You dare interrupt
this judgment?

33:21.760 --> 33:23.398
We fought hard.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.112
Their warlock used
your Fel against us.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.794
Only I can
control the Fel!

33:34.400 --> 33:37.358
I see you and your
men have survived.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.358
Perhaps Blackhand

33:39.520 --> 33:42.193
kept you safely away
from the battlefield?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.469
Maybe he knows
you're weak, too.

33:48.080 --> 33:51.595
Do you wish to challenge me,
little chieftain?

33:56.800 --> 33:58.950
I do not question,
Gul'Dan.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.315
But the Fel
is born of death.

34:01.680 --> 34:03.432
It must have a price.

34:05.320 --> 34:07.788
A price paid
in lives taken.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.512
Will you
hold your son?

34:38.360 --> 34:40.351
He will be
a great chieftain.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.069
Like his father.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.552
A born leader.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.036
I was no leader today.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.150
He challenges
you already.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.270
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,

35:02.760 --> 35:04.955
what chance do
the rest of us have?

35:08.720 --> 35:10.199
Whatever happens.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.278
Whatever happens.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.159
I see you.

35:29.600 --> 35:30.999
This gate,

35:31.560 --> 35:33.551
who showed it to Gul'Dan?

35:33.960 --> 35:35.871
Who led him to Azeroth?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.392
Gul'Dan called him
a demon.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.519
Did you see it?

35:41.120 --> 35:42.235
Not the face,

35:42.680 --> 35:43.999
but the voice.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.718
Like fire and ash.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.992
I'll be here
if you need me.

36:21.640 --> 36:22.709
Your mate.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.436
I could kill you
before he even reaches me.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.709
Lothar?

36:30.400 --> 36:32.356
He is my brother.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.511
The king is my mate.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.599
You're the chieftain's
wife then.

36:39.440 --> 36:40.839
I suppose so.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.270
Then killing you would bring
me even greater honor.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.879
Not among my kind.

36:48.400 --> 36:49.719
It is a cold night.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.392
I thought you might
use these.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.315
It will warm you.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.110
More of our villages
burn tonight.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.635
One of them is the
village of my birth.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.912
I cannot imagine what horrors
you have been through, Garona.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.030
But this doesn't
need to happen.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.200
We have had peace in these
lands for many years now.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.918
Peace between races
from all over the world.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.480
What is...

37:49.040 --> 37:50.678
I can have it removed.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.598
There is a life
here for you, Garona.

37:56.280 --> 37:57.429
With us.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.713
A life of freedom.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.958
If you want it.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.394
The Great Gate.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.875
"From light comes darkness

38:28.400 --> 38:30.550
"and from darkness light."

38:30.960 --> 38:32.439
Well, that's clear.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.308
"Ask Alodi."

38:35.320 --> 38:37.117
Alodi.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.637
It's good to see
trees again.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.079
And the snow.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.472
Even from a distance.

39:00.240 --> 39:03.630
Remember when we would track blood
ox through the Frostwind Dunes?

39:04.440 --> 39:05.759
There was always meat,

39:06.600 --> 39:08.431
always life.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.672
You don't think it's strange

39:10.760 --> 39:13.433
that we lost our home
when Gul'Dan came to power?

39:13.600 --> 39:16.273
One orc cannot
kill a world, Durotan.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.919
Are you sure?

39:18.120 --> 39:19.599
Look around you.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.190
Does it not remind
you of something?

39:24.600 --> 39:28.149
Wherever Gul'Dan works his magic,
the land dies.

39:29.320 --> 39:33.359
If our people are to make a home here,
my friend...

39:36.320 --> 39:37.958
Gul'Dan must be stopped.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.033
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.200
No.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.320
No.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.792
But with the humans' help,

39:53.640 --> 39:55.517
we could be.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.839
I want that weapon.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.598
You'll have me
to protect you.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.831
I need no one
to protect me!

40:25.400 --> 40:26.719
What are you looking at?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.755
Bookworm.
Take the first watch.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.189
Respectfully, Commander,
my name is Khadgar.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.074
My deepest apologies,
Khadgar.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.952
You see,
I thought we bonded

41:15.400 --> 41:16.736
when I didn't put
you in a prison cell

41:16.760 --> 41:18.200
for breaking into
the Royal Barracks.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.152
Now take the watch.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.077
Well, at least
you're not reading.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.433
He wishes to lie with me.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.275
Beg your pardon?

41:49.240 --> 41:50.240
You would be injured.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.680
I don't want
to lie with you.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.434
Good. You would not
be an effective mate.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.240
Why do you laugh?

41:59.560 --> 42:01.710
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.639
No muscles to protect you.

42:04.560 --> 42:05.959
Brittle bones that break.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.072
You don't look
that different to us.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.354
How did you survive?

42:11.240 --> 42:12.992
Broken bones
heal stronger.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.713
Mine are very strong.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.155
I'm sorry.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.313
Do not be.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.113
My name...

42:29.920 --> 42:31.114
Garona.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.437
It means "cursed" in Orc.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.954
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.

42:47.640 --> 42:48.914
They kept you alive, though.

42:50.520 --> 42:51.999
Gul'Dan did.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.637
He gave me her tusk.

42:58.720 --> 43:00.119
To remember her.

43:08.320 --> 43:11.710
My parents gave me to the Kirin Tor
when I was six years old.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.152
That's the last
time I saw them.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.510
Or any of my
brothers and sisters.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.156
It brings a family honor

43:24.240 --> 43:26.276
to offer a child
to the Kirin Tor.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.952
To have their son taken up to
the floating city of Dalaran

43:30.040 --> 43:33.077
and be trained by the most
powerful mages in the land.

43:35.320 --> 43:37.675
Less so, to have
them run away.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.279
Well, that was cheerful.

43:49.680 --> 43:50.908
The Great Gate.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.510
Why do they need
so many prisoners?

43:57.360 --> 43:59.032
Like wood for a fire.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.030
Green magic takes
life to open the gate.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.216
How many more orcs
are they planning on bringing?

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
All of them.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.717
This is just a warband.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.077
When the portal
is opened,

44:11.560 --> 44:13.391
Gul'Dan will bring
the Horde.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.552
Get them back
to Stormwind.

44:23.360 --> 44:24.634
We'll ride ahead.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.354
Garona.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.078
We should go. It's not safe...

44:39.920 --> 44:41.148
Durotan.

44:41.440 --> 44:45.069
To the north, there is a black rock
that touches the sky.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.831
I would meet
with their leader.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.674
To challenge him?

44:50.080 --> 44:52.958
I saw you lead the small-teeth
to our encampment.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.436
They have seen
what is being built.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.274
But only you know what Gul'Dan
has planned for my people.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.912
This magic is death,
to all things.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.518
Must be stopped.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.788
Tell him.

45:12.120 --> 45:15.271
The black rock,
when the sun is highest.

45:15.960 --> 45:16.960
I will.

45:18.960 --> 45:20.313
Chieftain.

45:21.320 --> 45:22.719
If I return,

45:23.320 --> 45:25.231
would you take me
into your clan?

45:27.640 --> 45:29.392
You're safer here.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.114
With them.

46:22.880 --> 46:24.871
Is it as you feared?

46:25.040 --> 46:26.996
The Fel is everywhere.

46:27.360 --> 46:29.396
Then you mustn't leave again.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.114
They need a Guardian's help
now more than ever.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.871
Maybe the boy can help.

46:43.880 --> 46:44.995
We need solutions!

46:45.160 --> 46:46.160
Easy for you
to say that!

46:46.360 --> 46:48.828
The Dwarven forges
must work overtime.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.195
You treat us
no better than dogs.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.316
We shall supply
you no more!

46:53.480 --> 46:54.708
Enough!

46:56.000 --> 46:57.760
You have all called on
Stormwind in the past.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.592
Either for troops
or arbitration.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.593
If we do not unite

47:02.840 --> 47:04.353
to fight this enemy,

47:05.360 --> 47:06.475
we will perish.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.595
Hear, hear.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.757
Stormwind needs
soldiers, arms, horses.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.176
We have our own
kingdoms to look after.

47:13.200 --> 47:15.240
- Fight your own wars!
- Your Majesty.

47:16.240 --> 47:17.355
Commander.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.073
The orcs are
building a portal,

47:19.160 --> 47:21.196
through which they
plan to bring an army.

47:21.400 --> 47:24.392
If we do not stop them now,
we may never get another opportunity.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.438
Where is he?

47:26.600 --> 47:28.955
Where is the protector
of Azeroth?

47:29.120 --> 47:30.120
Where is the Guardian?

47:30.440 --> 47:31.759
Where is Medivh?

47:32.640 --> 47:33.675
My liege.

47:33.840 --> 47:34.880
I suggest
we take a recess.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.456
Take as long as you like.

47:36.480 --> 47:37.913
We're done.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.474
Commander.

47:43.880 --> 47:46.553
What's left of the Fourth has
retreated from Stonewatch.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.914
What's left?

47:48.960 --> 47:50.393
Callan is among
the injured.

47:57.440 --> 47:58.440
Dad?

48:04.880 --> 48:06.518
I'm fine. It's fine.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.072
You had me worried.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.111
Where's the rest
of your troop?

48:17.280 --> 48:19.350
They took most
of them alive.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.839
We'll get them back.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.433
Don't be in such a hurry.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.233
You're all I have.

48:34.440 --> 48:35.668
I know.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.276
I'm a soldier.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.991
He would not ask
for this meeting

48:49.160 --> 48:51.037
if he thought he could
defeat Gul'Dan alone.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.312
The Fel must
truly terrify him.

48:55.480 --> 48:56.799
Durotan is scared
of nothing.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.757
The location.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.110
The suddenness
of this meeting.

49:03.880 --> 49:04.915
Sounds like a trap.

49:05.080 --> 49:06.559
It is not.
Could be.

49:06.640 --> 49:07.755
It is not!
Could be.

49:07.880 --> 49:08.880
It is not!

49:09.280 --> 49:10.474
What do you think?

49:11.320 --> 49:13.151
It's too good
an opportunity to ignore.

49:13.720 --> 49:15.551
I think we
have no choice.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.633
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.

49:20.840 --> 49:21.989
But we will need help.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.035
And if he's lying?

49:24.120 --> 49:25.189
Orcs do not lie.

49:25.360 --> 49:26.429
What if he is?

49:26.560 --> 49:28.437
There is no honor in it.
And where is the honor

49:28.560 --> 49:30.312
in him betraying
his own people?

49:30.760 --> 49:32.796
Durotan is
protecting his clan.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.473
His enemy is the Fel.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.153
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.

49:36.560 --> 49:38.790
This orc, Durotan...

49:39.320 --> 49:40.389
How do you know him?

49:40.560 --> 49:41.560
He freed me.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.757
And he is loved
by his clan.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.238
He is a strong chieftain.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.559
Strong chiefs
must earn their clan's trust.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.474
If we are to
expect you to join us,

49:54.600 --> 49:56.192
we must earn yours.

50:04.640 --> 50:07.074
To defend yourself.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.759
With this?

50:09.920 --> 50:11.717
Yes.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.951
Find the Guardian.

50:17.520 --> 50:18.919
What is this?

50:20.000 --> 50:21.228
Guardian?

50:25.480 --> 50:28.119
The gate. We saw it,
in the Morass.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.714
I've been putting together all
the clues I can about it.

50:30.920 --> 50:32.194
This.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.590
This drawing.
Where did you copy it from?

50:34.680 --> 50:35.715
Guardian.

50:35.800 --> 50:36.800
And this.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.673
And this.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.553
And this?

50:44.240 --> 50:46.256
I've been researching ever since
I felt the presence of the Fel.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.840
I am the Guardian! Me.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.077
Not you. Not yet.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.280
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.

51:03.960 --> 51:06.269
Don't presume
you can help me.

51:07.040 --> 51:09.395
You have no idea the forces

51:10.240 --> 51:12.071
I contend with.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.391
If you want to help,

51:16.240 --> 51:18.470
protect the king.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.271
You leave the Fel to me.

51:33.240 --> 51:34.832
Interesting choice.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.194
Guardian.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.478
Pack up and move to the west gate!

51:47.560 --> 51:50.757
You there! Rise from your stall
and get moving. Now!

51:57.040 --> 51:59.634
I need your help.
I found a book.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.800
Of course you did.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.536
There was an illustration
that showed a gate

52:02.560 --> 52:04.073
like the one we
saw being built.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.035
Sorry. Sorry.

52:06.200 --> 52:07.235
Khadgar.

52:08.880 --> 52:11.633
So then I tried to show the Guardian,
but he became furious.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.199
Burned all my research.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.160
He would've burned this,
too, if it hadn't been hidden in my robe.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.797
No, turn the page. Here.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.200
Look.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.675
See?

52:32.240 --> 52:33.912
What do you think
the image means?

52:34.000 --> 52:35.353
The orcs were summoned.

52:35.840 --> 52:38.354
From this side of the gate.
They were invited in.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.510
And the Guardian
burned your research?

52:48.640 --> 52:50.517
He's probably just
trying to protect you.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.233
Now go away.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.510
A good spot
for an ambush.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.395
Our sentries
are well placed.

53:20.280 --> 53:21.599
I will check again.

54:26.560 --> 54:27.720
I am King Llane.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.718
I'm told you wish to talk.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.336
Ask him
if they plan to return to their home.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.552
Our world is destroyed.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.376
There is nothing to go back to.

54:54.400 --> 54:57.312
We are not responsible
for destroying your world.

54:58.600 --> 55:00.216
War with us
will solve nothing.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.199
He says, for orcs,
war solves everything.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.513
Then why is he here?

55:18.400 --> 55:20.038
To save my people.

55:22.240 --> 55:24.834
The Fel takes life
from more than its victims.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.958
It kills the earth
and corrupts those who use it.

55:31.080 --> 55:34.197
Gul'Dan would poison everything
with his death magic.

55:35.080 --> 55:37.275
If my people are to survive,

55:37.840 --> 55:39.831
Gul'Dan must be destroyed!

55:42.520 --> 55:43.999
In two suns,

55:44.600 --> 55:46.795
the humans we have captured

55:48.440 --> 55:50.635
will be used to
fuel the portal.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.992
If you attack our camp

55:53.600 --> 55:55.636
and draw his warriors away,

55:57.520 --> 56:00.876
Frostwolf clan will kill him.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.078
Two days.

56:07.600 --> 56:09.079
If we do this,

56:09.640 --> 56:12.154
you will protect my
people until then?

56:15.480 --> 56:17.072
I will try.

56:20.120 --> 56:21.120
Ambush!

56:21.240 --> 56:22.240
It's a trap!

56:23.120 --> 56:24.758
Traitor, die!

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Retreat!

56:29.160 --> 56:30.275
Back!

56:30.440 --> 56:31.839
Protect our camp!

56:33.160 --> 56:34.513
Fall back!

56:36.680 --> 56:37.680
At the rim!

56:37.840 --> 56:39.360
Protect the king!

57:03.280 --> 57:04.640
Stay together!

57:08.840 --> 57:11.229
Focus, man. Like old times.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.070
Stand your ground!

57:31.240 --> 57:32.514
Spread out!

57:35.240 --> 57:36.673
Swords!

57:37.160 --> 57:38.160
Look out!

57:39.360 --> 57:40.475
Fall back!

57:51.160 --> 57:52.240
You all right?

57:55.320 --> 57:59.108
You're no good to us dead.
Go! I'll get the others.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.680
Fall back!

58:01.840 --> 58:03.239
We're all getting out.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.958
Medivh will cover our retreat.

58:08.640 --> 58:09.640
Spread out!

58:11.480 --> 58:13.232
Protect the rear!

58:13.360 --> 58:14.395
Watch out!

58:18.520 --> 58:19.714
Garona!

58:22.440 --> 58:23.440
Stay together!

58:27.760 --> 58:29.079
Fall back!

58:31.040 --> 58:32.598
Cover your ground!

58:33.160 --> 58:34.479
Where's the bloody Guardian?

58:34.560 --> 58:36.551
At the rear!

58:41.280 --> 58:42.395
Protect the king.

58:42.560 --> 58:43.788
I got them.

58:59.800 --> 59:01.950
Shield formation!

59:06.400 --> 59:07.469
Kill the beast!

59:52.320 --> 59:54.072
Retreat to the plateau!

59:55.160 --> 59:56.160
Fall back!

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.189
Medivh.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.474
Medivh! Take it down!

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.560
Medivh!

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.359
Hold on, son.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:49.995
Dad.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.312
For Azeroth.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.152
Medivh!

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680
Callan.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680
He's here.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160
What's wrong with him?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.799
We need to get
him to Karazhan.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.995
I'll get the horses.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.216
You won't make it
in time by road.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.593
Take one of my birds.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.919
Place him
in the font.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.554
Moroes, what's wrong
with him?

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.870
I told him not
to leave Karazhan.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.231
I have to go.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.909
We need the help of
the Kirin Tor. Now!

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.080
Go.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.549
There are medicines I must prepare.
Sit with him.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.594
You and the baby
must leave now!

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.434
You are a traitor,
Durotan.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:55.759
No.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.629
One who values what we once were.
Like you used to.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.677
That time has passed.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.070
We are but fuel
for the Fel now.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.998
There is still hope,
Blackhand.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.472
Our children.

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.591
Do not make me take
more innocent lives,

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.039
young chieftain.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.234
If I submit...

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.350
Would you
let my people be?

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.591
What will I call our son?

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640
Go'el.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.320
You.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.918
Where's the old man?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.039
He told me
to watch you.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.469
The king?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.238
He is alive.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.552
Lothar's son is dead.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.152
I argued
for the meeting.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.118
Lothar will hate me.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.279
This upsets you?

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.398
He is a great warrior.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:42.434
He defends
his people well.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.513
A good mate
for an orc.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.032
I am no orc.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.271
I am no human either.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:00.116
When I was younger,
I used to feel apart from my kin.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.755
I traveled far and wide,
looking for

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.915
wisdom.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.350
Feel a connection
with all the souls

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.034
I was charged
with protecting.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.388
In my travels,
I met a strong

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.312
and noble people.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.314
Among them, a female.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:24.597
Who accepted me
for who I was.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.799
Who loved me.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:35.273
It was not a life I was fated to have,
but it taught me something.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.995
If love is what you need,

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.910
you must be willing to travel to
the ends of the world to find it.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.513
You left your mate.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.239
Go find Lothar.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.515
Step inside the circle.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.560
This

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.270
is my gift to you,
Garona.

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.313
Whole world in
exchange for a statue.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.555
Gods are strange
creatures.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.511
Frostwolves.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.399
You are
a practical people.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.990
Those of us from the south have
always admired that about you.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.511
When the portal opens

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.399
and the rest of
the Horde join us,

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.599
we will gift them the Fel.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.269
All of them.

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:37.078
Durotan did not
agree to this!

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.951
And why would you care
what that traitor thinks?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.510
It is time for a new leader
of the Frostwolf clan.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.598
One who has the best interests
of his orcs in mind.

01:08:48.279 --> 01:08:51.158
One who appreciates
Gul'Dan's vision.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.198
His power.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.868
Come...

01:08:59.479 --> 01:09:01.868
I will grant you
the Fel.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:04.879
Durotan,

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.598
he has poisoned the
Frostwolves against Fel.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.912
Let me gather them.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.238
Bring them here.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.559
Grant me the Fel
in front of them.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.189
Let them see how
much stronger I become.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.831
As I said,

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.831
a practical people.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.075
This is a new dawn.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.594
The time of the Horde.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.752
Be feared

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.238
or be fuel.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.319
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.479
Callan's mother

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.476
died in childbirth.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.032
I blamed him for it

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.079
for years.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.797
I'm not gonna blame you.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.478
He was so young.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.192
In my entire life,

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.148
I've never felt as
much pain as I do now.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.200
No...

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.673
No!

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.716
Move out. Go!

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920
Move!

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.072
Gul'Dan does not want to waste
his power on the Frostwolves.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.673
Burn them!

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.840
Take the weak,
kill the strong!

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.639
Get them!

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.791
I'll bathe in your blood!

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Maybe.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.189
But not now.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:35.436
I can't give you long,

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.039
but I can give
you a head start.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.716
For the sake of
your son, Draka.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.559
Leave.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.234
Now.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.550
Kill them all!

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.791
Burn it down!

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.389
You should have
trusted in your Chieftain,

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.915
Orgrim Doomhammer.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.239
She's getting away!

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.712
Wait for me.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:45.920
Khadgar!

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.877
How dare you return here!

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:48.960
Get out!

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.393
I come seeking
your wisdom.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.240
There is nothing
for you here now.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.152
The Guardian
Medivh is unwell.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.640
What?

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.438
He has been
poisoned by the Fel.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.511
What?
Ridiculous!

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.672
What do you know
of the Dark Portal?

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.193
You come back

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.634
and accuse the Guardian...

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:05.949
What is Alodi?

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.316
How does he know?

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.638
Alodi.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.514
What is it?

01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.709
An entity from a time before
the Kirin Tor existed.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.993
We think it served a function
similar to that of the Guardian.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.159
Protector.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.799
No one beyond the Arch Council
knows of its existence.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.632
And it will stay
that way.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.630
For you to mention it in the
same breath as the Dark Portal

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.199
is too much
to be mere...

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:44.199
Coincidence.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.589
Do I go in?

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.753
I don't know.
It's never done that before.

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:10.708
Khadgar...

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.239
I know you.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.072
From the library.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.148
You're Alodi?

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.428
I used

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.349
the last of my energies
to summon you here.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.516
The Guardian has betrayed us.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.388
Medivh.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.188
I saw the Fel
in his eyes.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:35.675
He is consumed by it.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.717
If he is not stopped,

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.871
this world will burn.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.039
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.115
Guardian is but a name.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:49.279
The true guardians
of this world

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.635
are the people themselves.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.673
I know you see what
the Kirin Tor cannot.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.598
It's why you left them.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.870
No one

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.470
can stand against the darkness

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.919
alone.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.478
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.591
Yes, you do.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.753
Trust in your friends.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.319
Together

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.958
you can save this world.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.879
Always remember,

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:27.520
from light comes darkness

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.033
and from darkness...

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.073
Light.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600
Up, up.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.394
Thank you, Moroes.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.117
You'll recover, Guardian.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.959
You always do.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.908
No.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.033
Thank you.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.676
For everything you've done.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.114
I'm sorry, old friend.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.037
Seems that I have let
the orcs into this world.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.797
The Fel, it has twisted me.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.472
I don't even know what
else I may have done.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.276
I just don't remember.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.318
Everything I've
thought to protect, I have...

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.348
Destroyed.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.870
I can't control the Fel.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:01.039
No one can.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.714
Five legions
to block Deadwind Pass.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:20.556
Another 10 here, here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.948
Supply lines here.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.157
While the Eastern Sea hems
them in both south and east.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.075
If we hold these positions,
we will be at our strongest.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.309
Containment.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.152
Until there is
a better option, yes.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.597
And when there's 10 times as many?
What then?

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:41.193
If there were easy answers...

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.158
Our priority must be
to stop the gate from opening.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:46.552
Fail there, and it's
just a matter of time

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.472
before they beat us
with sheer numbers.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.238
What do you suggest?

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.991
Send everything
we've got.

01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.231
Destroy the gate,
free our people

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.753
and end the
immediate threat.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.194
And the orcs that remain?

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.520
We'll take care
of them later.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.636
After they've ravaged
the entire kingdom.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:04.280
My lords.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.992
Medivh,
you are up and well.

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.513
I am.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.919
I feel...

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.795
Restored.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.109
We need you.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.032
We've been agonizing
over our options.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.270
Some of us believe
there are no options.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.793
We need fresh eyes.
I have news.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.238
I met with Durotan.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.913
You met with Durotan?

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.593
The rebellion
against Gul'Dan

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.191
is gaining strength.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.350
With their help,
we can destroy this gate.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.839
That doesn't change
my plan.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920
What plan?

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.032
Anduin believes we should
attack with full force.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:36.759
I'm concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.398
How many
legions would you need

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.913
to hold the orcs in place?

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.551
Five for
Deadwind Pass.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.948
10 for the Redridge
Mountains,

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.160
10 more to
protect the city.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.476
We've already
lost 18 legions.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.949
That leaves one,
two, three.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.189
Can it be done, Medivh?

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.478
No, it can't be done.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.390
With three legions,
Frostwolves and my power...

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.472
With all due respect,
Guardian your powers

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.312
have proven unreliable at best,
recently.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.496
Llane, have I ever
let you down?

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.520
Let him down?

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.830
Where have you even been
for the last six years?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160
Please, Anduin...

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.275
Medivh is the Guardian.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.237
Not the one
you remember.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.148
He's lost!

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320
He's unstable!

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.511
And he won't be there
when you really need him.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.672
Find your bearings,
Anduin.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.831
I would march
into Hell for you

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.594
if I thought there was the
slightest chance of victory.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.069
But there isn't.
This is suicide.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.229
Is this about Callan?

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.598
It was a tragedy.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.433
If he hadn't been trying so
hard to win your approval

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.800
he might still
be with us today.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.108
Medivh.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.111
Callan wasn't ready,
you knew it.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.872
And you let him
play soldier anyway.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.359
Anduin, stop! No!

01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520
You killed him!

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:44.789
Just save it!

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.279
Commander, please, sir!
Please!

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.799
Varis.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.510
Take him to
a cell to calm down.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.676
You are no use
to us like this.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.951
We'll protect
the kingdom, my lord.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.039
You and I.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.589
Why are you here?

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.229
The King.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.153
He goes to fight
the Horde.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.033
With your Guardian's help

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.073
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.428
Don't trust him.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.192
I have told you,
orcs do not lie.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.674
Not Durotan.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.839
Don't trust Medivh.

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.432
I will try to
protect your king.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.073
Don't go with them.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.429
Why?

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.231
I don't want you
to get hurt.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:15.879
Come back alive.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.631
- Free us.
- We're thirsty!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.392
Spare us! Spare us!

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.749
Please!
We need your help!

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.432
Hey! Frostwolf!

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.992
Now, you're
enemies with all sides.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.718
I'll tell them
it was you.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.553
What happened?

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.116
I'm sorry, Durotan.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.272
I did not see how we could
side with the humans,

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.237
against our own kind.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.193
I was wrong.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.354
Gul'Dan's Fel
magic is destroying us.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.272
Where's Draka?
Safe.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.353
But the rest...

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.874
They wouldn't follow him if they
could see what he has become.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.357
Then I'll show them.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:13.152
There is no other
man I would entrust

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.998
the safety of my
family to, Varian.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.354
Keep them safe
while I'm gone.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.115
Ready?

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.708
I would feel better if
Lothar were riding with us.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.435
We'll be fine.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.669
I will return to Karazhan,
get ready for battle.

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.348
Find me at the portal.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.759
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.309
Psst.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.075
Guard!

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:12.634
I know you're just doing your job.
And a good one at that.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:15.678
But I've cooled down now.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.754
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.834
So I can protect the King.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.559
Open the gates!

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.675
I am just following my...

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.915
Where the hell have you been?
The Kirin Tor.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.480
It only works on the simple-minded.
Lasts about a minute.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.435
Your armor, Commander.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.115
Sorry.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.557
They have a full
day ahead of us.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.416
I just hope
we're not too late.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.440
We can't go after them.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.160
Not if you want
to save Azeroth.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.356
My King needs me!
Azeroth needs you more!

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.751
If you want to save your King,
we need to stop Medivh first.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.400
Where is Medivh?

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.352
We've got a demon
to kill.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.995
Can't be far.
Search over there.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.031
I need that baby.

01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.993
Check everywhere!

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.273
Search on the road!

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.515
Remember,

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.550
you are the son of
Durotan and Draka,

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:49.750
an unbroken
line of chieftains.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.360
Search by the river.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.039
I am Durotan.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.632
Son of Garad.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.036
Chieftain of
the Frostwolf clan.

01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:49.631
And I am here to kill Gul'Dan.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.953
A ghost cannot
invoke <i>mak'gora.</i>

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:57.469
You are the chieftain
of no clan.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.597
Your people are
food for worms.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:04.159
Some of us still
live, Warchief.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.191
Shall I make
a quick end of them?

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.429
I always thought you were one
for tradition, Blackhand.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.153
Durotan.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:23.710
Your clan was weak
and you are a traitor.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.839
I accept your challenge

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.078
if only to personally rip the
heart out of your pathetic body.

01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:32.794
What of the portal?

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.633
You must be ready when
the incantation begins.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.151
This won't take long.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.672
Crush him, Gul'Dan!

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.320
It's the incantation
to the orc home world.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.880
He's opening the portal.
We need to shut him up.

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.759
The incantation...

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.551
I have no time for this.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:31.915
Blackhand!

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.751
This is a <i>mak'gora.</i>

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.950
You will respect
our tradition.

01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.075
Keep fighting.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:55.278
Gul'Dan cheats!

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.995
That's cheating!

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160
Shame on you!

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:07.639
You cheat, Gul'Dan!

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.472
This is not our way!

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.319
Traitor!

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:28.349
Gul'Dan!

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.875
You have no honor.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.392
You will follow this thing?

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.394
Will you?

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.150
You will follow
this demon?

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:36.548
We will not!

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.829
I will not.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.194
Demon!

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.696
He does not
even look orc now!

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:42.950
I follow a true orc!

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.319
A chieftain.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:54.830
May your bones rot,
demon!

01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.913
Anyone else?

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.917
And you, Warchief.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.119
You will take the Fel

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:13.590
and you will become stronger
than any orc has ever been.

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.035
And when the Fel
has remade you,

01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.554
you will crush
the small-teeth.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.474
Now claim my new world.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.435
Frostwolves.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:40.198
We are on
our own now.

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.039
We few, then.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.071
Get to the prisoners.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.991
We will free our people!

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.639
Charge!

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.239
Get to it, men!

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:01.475
Move!

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.233
Attack!

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.875
Ideas?

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.400
Very impressive.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.591
Now try shutting him up.

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.680
Well, that went well.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:32.631
It's moving! Do something!

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.355
Fine.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.873
I'll handle this.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040
You take care of Medivh.

01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.115
Hey, over here!

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.355
Clay face!

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.515
Now, men!

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.994
Fire!

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.714
At the rear!

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.798
Come, my orcs.

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.312
Let the Fel unleash the
full power of the Horde!

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:15.720
For Gul'Dan!

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.119
For the Horde!

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.630
Hey! Kid, wake up!

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.400
You all right?

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.072
Quick thinking.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.191
Slicing its head off like that.
Yeah.

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.471
Just how I planned it.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.034
What now?

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.680
The Guardian has to speak
the incantation himself.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.712
As long as he's doing that,
we can get in close.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.714
Distract him.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.040
Then what?

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.594
Get Medivh in the font.

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.678
Is that all?

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.995
Medivh.

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.878
If there is something of you
still in there, old friend,

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.715
come back to us.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:20.033
Medivh.

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.589
Come on.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:34.235
Kill me.

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.313
I've got nothing
left to live for now anyway.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.955
After all, life is just
fuel to you, isn't it?

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.870
But Llane, he believed in you.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.318
Don't kill your king.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.634
Don't kill your friend.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:06.598
Whatever you plan
to do, kid,

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.153
do it now!

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:15.549
Now.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.153
Now! Now!

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.313
Now, kid!

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:31.396
The portal, it's closing!
Then do it now!

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.629
No.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.359
You're stronger
than he is.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.828
From light comes darkness,

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.558
and from darkness,

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.549
light.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.035
Show me your eyes.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.112
I have to go.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:08.789
I'm proud of you.

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.669
Stormwind.

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.914
My lord! Through
the portal, Stormwind!

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.512
Thank you, Guardian.

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.640
Varis.

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:47.353
Legion, forward!

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.629
Attack!

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:53.272
Garona, ride with me.

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:12.155
Run!

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.991
Varis, set the men
in a perimeter.

01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:24.670
Garona, Karos, take what men we
can spare and free the prisoners.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.518
And send them
through to Stormwind.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.637
Form a line,
shield to shield!

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.400
We will hold
as long as we can.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:33.155
Get to the portal!

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.200
Go!

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:38.868
Mercy! Thank you!

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.989
Stormwind.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:56.873
Need more powder!

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:02.153
Help me push!

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.953
Come on, boys!

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:07.031
Put some spunk into it!

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.030
Go around!
We'll attack them from behind the portal!

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.108
Watch your flank!

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.793
Take care of him.

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.679
We should leave!

01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.274
We save as many of
our people as we can!

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.751
It's the loneliness.

01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.191
It makes us weak.

01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.675
Khadgar.

01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.273
I'm sorry.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:01.429
I wanted to save us all.

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:05.669
I always did.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.469
No!

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.595
It's closed!

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.279
We've lost the Guardian.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.760
No, no, no!

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:13.673
Blackhand comes
to claim the honor of killing you.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.515
Garona.

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.351
No good will come
from us both dying.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.989
Look around you.

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:29.193
We're surrounded.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:34.117
Your killing me is the only
hope we have for peace.

01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:38.551
You told Lady Taria that killing
her would bring you honor.

01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.034
Well, killing me
will make you a hero.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.068
Survive.

01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.999
Bring peace between
orcs and humans.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.314
You must.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:15.319
You must.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:43.039
No! My lord!

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:03.200
She has killed
their chieftain, Gul'Dan.

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:07.029
The Horde embraces you.

01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:10.669
Orc.

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:46.160
Huh?

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.398
<i>Mak'gora.</i>

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.188
For my son.

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:16.188
Kill him.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:22.788
Kill him!

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.160
Gul'Dan!

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.832
The <i>mak'gora</i> is sacred.

01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:34.034
The human won. Fairly.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:37.351
Let your warriors
honor their tradition.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.795
I will not be disobeyed!

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.310
What are you
waiting for?

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.832
Do as I say!

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.114
Traitors!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.468
Get out of my way.
I'll do it myself!

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.309
Who will obey you?

01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:05.074
If you go to war
with your own kind...

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.999
If you do this,
you will lose the Horde.

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.155
And this war is
only beginning.

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.474
For your son.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:59.115
So your spirit
can teach him.

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.075
Garona's dagger.

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.672
I pulled that
from Llane's neck.

01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:37.952
Well, there has to
be an explanation.

01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:40.198
Yes.

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:42.277
She made her choice.

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.673
I don't believe that.

01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:50.912
Maybe you and I didn't know her
as well as we thought we did.

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:58.913
<i>There is no greater
blessing a city can have</i>

01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:00.953
than a king

01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.475
who would sacrifice
himself for his people.

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.920
But such a sacrifice
must be earned.

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.153
We must deserve it.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:18.478
If we only show our unity
to mourn a good man's death,

01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.111
was King Llane
wrong to believe in you?

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.874
No!

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:26.277
We will avenge him, my lady!

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:30.151
Lead us
against the orcs, Lothar!

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.637
Lothar! Lothar! Lothar!

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.353
For Azeroth!

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.670
For Azeroth
and the Alliance!

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:53.751
For Azeroth!

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.636
For the Alliance!

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.994
<i>You will
travel far, my little Go'el.</i>

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.349
<i>My world may be lost,
but this is your world now.</i>

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.870
<i>Take what you need from it.</i>

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:39.635
<i>Make a home for the orcs and
let no one stand in your way.</i>

01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:44.956
My lord,
you should see this.

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.397
<i>You are the son of
Durotan and Draka,</i>

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.309
<i>an unbroken line
of chieftains.</i>

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:55.551
<i>And our people need a leader
now more than ever.</i>
