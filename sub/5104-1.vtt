02:54.908 --> 02:56.205
Holy shit!

03:05.351 --> 03:06.648
Oh, fuck!

03:10.390 --> 03:11.755
No, no, no!

03:22.335 --> 03:23.563
Oh, shit!

03:43.256 --> 03:46.191
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to <i>Jackass!</i>

03:59.372 --> 04:02.569
All right, boys and girls.
It's time for a puppet show.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.268
Once upon a time,
there was a hungry serpent

04:07.380 --> 04:10.838
and a lonely field mouse
who needed a friend.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.678
Hello, Mr. Serpent.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.623
My name is Mr. Mousey.
I wanna be your friend.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.486
Yeah, just make sure my
whole weiner's out. I wanna look good.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.257
How about if I tickle him on the tail?
Hey, over here.

04:30.403 --> 04:31.870
That's not nice.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.498
That's not the way we play back home.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.167
That was not nice.

04:37.744 --> 04:38.768
Dude.

04:39.712 --> 04:41.543
He's like an inch away.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.584
Here we go. Give me a little kissy.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.878
A little kiss.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.926
Oh, God!

05:01.067 --> 05:02.898
Oh, God, that hurts!

05:15.581 --> 05:17.811
It's got its tooth stuck in his dick!

05:21.721 --> 05:24.212
I guess the puppet show's over then.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.722
Oh, my God.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.426
"Hi, Jackass guys.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.165
"I heard you were staying at this hotel."

05:36.269 --> 05:38.066
- What the fuck is that?
- Dude, look at that.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.230
It's like... Someone like...

05:40.473 --> 05:43.840
Look at it. What is this?
I can't even read it, dude.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.869
Read it out loud.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.880
"Hi, Jackass guys.
I heard you were staying at this hotel.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.974
"My name is Stephanie
and me and my friends love you.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.852
"Some of you actually hooked up
with my sister four years ago.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.787
"I don't care about that."

05:58.891 --> 06:00.882
Oh! You fucking dick.

06:07.734 --> 06:08.860
Oh, my God.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.129
I was wondering
why it was so fucking small.

06:11.237 --> 06:12.397
Did you see this?

06:12.505 --> 06:17.067
Fucking fans just wrote this, like,
saying how much they want to fuck us.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.104
And it says...
Read it up close. It's fucking hilarious.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.840
- Read it out loud for the camera.
- Okay.

06:26.619 --> 06:29.952
"Some of you actually hooked up
with my sister four years ago."

06:30.056 --> 06:31.785
It was probably you.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.558
"And I don't care about that.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.494
"Me and my friends
will totally rock your world.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.791
"I wanna fuck you all."

06:54.380 --> 06:57.440
It's the fucking stupidest thing
I've ever seen.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.984
Fans actually put that...
Read the little part, dude.

07:13.499 --> 07:17.526
Get Wee Man's little ass up here
but only if... No one be in the hall.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.596
- Just, like, Bam. He's selling it so good.
- Is there a chair out here?

07:21.707 --> 07:25.507
Wee Man, dude,
some girl wants to rock your world.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.069
Dude, you got to read this.
These fans put up this...

07:29.182 --> 07:30.547
Dude, stand on this.

07:30.650 --> 07:34.279
Read it out loud for the camera.
It's perfect "behind the scenes", dude.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.550
"Hi, Jackass guys.
I heard you were staying at this hotel.

07:37.657 --> 07:41.559
"My name is Stephanie
and me and my friends love you.

07:41.694 --> 07:45.687
"Some of you actually hooked up
with my sister four years ago.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.799
"I don't care about that.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.765
"Me and my friends..."

07:57.477 --> 07:59.308
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.944
He actually stood on the chair.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.776
Why would there ever be a chair
in the hallway?

08:09.422 --> 08:11.890
I'm Dave England,
and this is the Firehose Rodeo.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.297
Fucking hell!

08:22.401 --> 08:23.766
God damn it!

08:33.479 --> 08:34.446
Oh, shit!

08:46.225 --> 08:49.023
- Bravo, homo.
- Did you see how he slammed?

08:54.867 --> 08:57.199
My ass hurts so fucking bad!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.303
- Hey, is it bleeding?
- Yeah.

09:01.407 --> 09:03.170
Man, you are bleeding.

09:03.609 --> 09:06.305
- My ass is bleeding?
- We have rectal bleeding.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.403
Another first for <i>Jackass.</i>

09:11.918 --> 09:15.046
Get back here, you little bastard!
Get back here!

09:36.042 --> 09:39.569
Now it's time
for a little Bicentennial BMXing.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.287
- All right.
- Alley-oop.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.983
Hear ye, hear ye.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.260
This is really going to suck.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.834
Why would anybody ride this shit?

10:06.672 --> 10:08.833
It's like, what's the reasoning?

10:08.941 --> 10:12.308
Why wouldn't they just make
two of the same-size wheel?

10:19.151 --> 10:20.584
Oh, fuck.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.319
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.887
You didn't land it.

10:27.994 --> 10:31.122
<i>My head stopped my body</i>
<i>from getting really hurt on that one.</i>

10:33.032 --> 10:34.021
Oh, fuck.

10:35.668 --> 10:38.535
See, we have a weight going up
and it's supposed to hit me in the nuts,

10:38.638 --> 10:42.267
but I'd prefer to have, like,
a dildo instead of the weight

10:42.375 --> 10:46.334
and then, instead of the nuts,
it'll be my ass. It'll go right in.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.612
That's the way to do it.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.705
Could somebody
make a dick run? Please?

10:54.420 --> 10:57.856
Today's debate.
Is it wrong to be strong?

10:58.190 --> 10:59.782
You be the judge.

11:11.537 --> 11:15.701
Now, Bam just took a golden dildo
up his ass at high speed.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.204
That's what happened.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.345
My name is Gloria and I'm 90 years old.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.153
And I'm a slut.

11:29.588 --> 11:32.113
Okay, I'm going to go
get us a table now, okay?

11:32.224 --> 11:34.488
- Bye, Mama. Thank you.
- Goodbye.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.958
Go ahead. I'm fine.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.943
Excuse me, sir.
Could I use your cellular telephone?

11:58.017 --> 11:59.143
What's the number?

11:59.251 --> 12:01.378
I don't know what number. It's the driver.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.614
- Oh, yes. Could you dial it for me?
- Yes, yes.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.985
What is the number?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.685
I don't know.
What is his number? I don't know.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.556
This happens every time I go to brunch.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.426
- Is this okay for now?
- Yes, thank you.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.308
I'm Danger Ehren, here with Thor,
and this is the Mini-Loop.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.651
He can barely ride it.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.348
Fuck.

12:41.460 --> 12:42.518
Fuck!

12:43.496 --> 12:45.521
All right, let Thor try it.

12:52.571 --> 12:53.538
Come on.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.535
I hit my head pretty hard.

13:00.246 --> 13:03.374
Good thing I'm wearing that helmet.
Safety first.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.715
I love that confidence.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.683
I'm not gay but I...
I kind of want to fuck him.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.736
- Come on, Danger, get on it.
- How's the bike?

13:26.839 --> 13:28.329
Bike's good.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.237
He's mocking the loop.

13:45.524 --> 13:49.187
After this movie comes out, you're
totally going to lose your virginity.

13:49.295 --> 13:53.026
- You almost pulled it off.
- I don't think dudes count, Chris.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.093
Here we are
at some random-ass ranch,

13:56.202 --> 13:57.794
and this is the Brand.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.304
And it's gonna suck.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.902
- Drop them.
- Good luck.

14:05.010 --> 14:05.977
Christ!

14:06.111 --> 14:08.170
- You have no hair on your ass.
- It is pretty.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.214
- You ready?
- No.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.377
- You better get ready quick.
- That is a mini hard dick right there.

14:14.486 --> 14:17.284
Try not to move around. You don't want
to have two of those things on you.

14:17.389 --> 14:20.017
Oh, dear God.
I wasn't bummed for you, till right now.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.183
Okay.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.085
If I take it off,
it's gonna go cold in a second.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.992
I have to keep it on
until we're ready to film.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.189
Fuck.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.225
All right.
You said 10 seconds 20 seconds ago.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.203
Clean him off.

14:33.305 --> 14:34.670
- All right, you ready?
- No.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.001
Don't move.

14:36.108 --> 14:39.339
- Go, go, go!
- Don't move.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.436
Press it hard, you idiot!

14:43.949 --> 14:46.008
Fuck! It's good.

14:46.118 --> 14:49.053
No, it's not, dude. You got to hold it to it.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.918
Oh, fuck!
Dude, that hurts so fucking bad!

14:54.026 --> 14:57.052
Well, if you didn't jump out of the way,
I would've had it done the first time.

14:57.162 --> 15:01.360
- You should've pressed, you asshole!
- I did press! You went like that!

15:03.569 --> 15:06.766
Fuck! Oh, God damn, that hurt so bad.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.499
Turn around.

15:08.607 --> 15:11.633
I'm not going to burn you again.
I already got you three times.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.679
- Three of them.
- You gave me a hologram dick.

15:15.614 --> 15:19.209
There's three solid dicks,
there's one half-assed one right here

15:19.318 --> 15:21.149
and then you gave me a set of balls.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.517
- But a sweet set of balls.
- Rad.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.086
I'd rather rip my dick off
and throw it in the river

15:26.191 --> 15:28.022
than to do that again.

15:28.494 --> 15:29.722
God damn.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.860
We're at Ape and Phil's house

15:34.199 --> 15:38.033
and I'm gonna present them
the branded dick on my butt.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.631
Let me rephrase that. Dicks.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.675
- Well, I gave him a present.
- What present?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.073
He loved it.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.202
- What?
- It still hurts.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.373
- What? What am I looking at?
- He gave me a dick farm on my ass.

15:50.482 --> 15:54.680
Oh, my God! What is that?
What is that?

15:54.787 --> 15:56.550
- I branded his ass.
- It's supposed to be a dick

15:56.655 --> 15:58.748
but he did it six times,
so now I have a dick farm on my ass.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.052
- Is that permanent?
- Yes! Look!

16:01.160 --> 16:05.324
- What is that, a tattoo?
- It's a brand. A hot iron for cows.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.831
Bam, that is so infected!

16:07.933 --> 16:11.425
That does not look good. Oh, my God,
he's going to have that for life!

16:11.537 --> 16:14.472
- You're going to have that for life.
- No shit.

16:14.873 --> 16:18.206
If you have one on there, you should've
made it bigger and more realistic.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.541
- That puny thing's embarrassing.
- Ape, I got a muffed-up-ass butt.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.377
I know, and you had the cutest butt ever
and now you've ruined it.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.917
- No, Dick Farm Dunn ruined it.
- Yeah, why'd you ruin it?

16:27.019 --> 16:30.079
I tried to do it good. He jumped around.
I was scared. I'm burning my own friend.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.453
Why would you burn him
in the first place, Dunn?

16:32.558 --> 16:34.048
- Because it was funny.
- It's not funny.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.919
Get ready to be happy,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.897
Johnny Knoxville is going to jump
the entire lake.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.766
He's amazing.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.945
<i>What happened? You were going about</i>
<i>one mile per hour,</i>

16:59.051 --> 17:00.643
<i>then, all of a sudden, 60.</i>

17:00.753 --> 17:01.947
<i>I thought you were gonna hang on.</i>

17:02.054 --> 17:04.715
<i>There is no holding on</i>
<i>to that motherfucker.</i>

17:04.823 --> 17:06.313
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

17:06.959 --> 17:10.759
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Zupan</i>
<i>is going to jump the entire lake.</i>

17:11.663 --> 17:15.064
Mark, give our regards
to the folks on the other side.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.675
<i>I thought they forgot to set it off</i>
<i>and then it just took off.</i>

17:28.414 --> 17:30.644
- <i>I don't know what happened.</i>
- <i>I don't either.</i>

17:30.749 --> 17:33.217
- <i>All I know is he almost made it.</i>
- <i>He's a hero.</i>

17:33.318 --> 17:35.616
We're here in England
with Mat Hoffman

17:35.721 --> 17:39.657
and he's about to jump
the English Channel into Germany.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.292
Good luck, Mat.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.971
<i>That was fucking great.</i>

17:56.408 --> 17:59.104
<i>What was so great about that?</i>
<i>He didn't even go to Germany.</i>

17:59.211 --> 18:00.701
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:03.148 --> 18:06.515
It's a lovely day for a swim
in the Gulf of Mexico.

18:06.618 --> 18:09.485
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Fish Hook.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.804
Oh, man, that's gone through. I got you.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.750
- Oh, dude.
- We got it? We're good?

18:41.854 --> 18:43.913
That hurt to do that to you.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.320
Yeah, it looks great.

18:48.026 --> 18:51.553
- Oh, my God.
- All right, cast me out, God damn it.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.197
Now it's time for some man-fishing.

18:56.768 --> 18:59.032
- The hammerhead's right there.
- Oh, my God.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.596
Thank God we brought Manny
to make sure sharks would show up.

19:02.708 --> 19:06.144
He's coming to get you, Steve-O.
Act like a sick or wounded animal.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.645
Look at that fin right behind him.

19:09.381 --> 19:12.350
Dude, isn't this movie
supposed to be a comedy?

19:16.588 --> 19:20.354
I can't believe I'm fishing for sharks
with Steve-O as my bait.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.188
It's like a dream come true.

19:22.294 --> 19:23.784
Oh, my God.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.257
- Here comes a mako!
- Oh, shit! Steve-O!

19:30.903 --> 19:33.667
Oh, my God.
He's right behind you, Steve-O.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.468
- I am the fuck out of here.
- No, you're good, man.

19:37.576 --> 19:38.941
Stay in there.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.342
The shark's coming right at you!

19:44.850 --> 19:46.181
Oh, shit.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.413
- Come on, stay out there, O!
- You already got the fucking shot!

19:51.523 --> 19:53.081
I want to hear Manny scream.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.127
Dude, I fucking kicked the thing
in the fucking head!

19:56.295 --> 19:57.455
Get up here.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.462
<i>Steve-O, do you know</i>
<i>how lucky you are?</i>

20:00.566 --> 20:01.897
<i>A mako almost bit your foot off.</i>

20:02.000 --> 20:03.695
<i>I've been so lucky today.</i>

20:09.675 --> 20:10.733
Fuck!

20:13.679 --> 20:15.078
You are lucky.

20:15.547 --> 20:19.347
Fuck, that hurts. Damn it.
Thank you so much, God.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.850
You bastard.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.401
This is champion card-thrower
Jim Karol.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.334
He's come to throw cards
into Wee Man's ass.

20:41.440 --> 20:45.399
What Wee Man doesn't realize is that
he'll be sitting on the Electric Stool.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.281
God, I hate picking on Wee Man.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.688
- Wee Man, I'd say you're up.
- Jump up on the stool.

21:03.562 --> 21:05.325
All right, on three
I'm gonna whip it at you.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.625
You might feel it a little bit, all right?

21:07.733 --> 21:09.894
- On three. Ready?
- Don't worry about it.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.026
One,

21:11.637 --> 21:12.695
two...

21:15.440 --> 21:18.307
Fuck! That fucking...

21:19.544 --> 21:20.568
Did it hit a nerve?

21:20.679 --> 21:24.479
- Dude, it hit, like, right in there.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I threw it too hard.

21:24.583 --> 21:28.383
Try one more. It didn't stick.
He's going to get it to stick.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.553
On three. One,

21:32.858 --> 21:33.825
two,

21:34.426 --> 21:35.552
three.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.393
I don't fucking like that, dude.
No, I don't fucking like that, dude.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.433
That fucking hurts, dude.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.024
Tell the camera
exactly what's happening.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.196
All right, every time this dude
throws a fucking card in my ass,

21:47.306 --> 21:49.331
it fucking jolts me, so I jump off.

21:49.441 --> 21:51.306
I'm not going to fucking sit there.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.775
- Let me do a pickup shot.
- No.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.472
The pickup shot is,
you pinch the card in your butt.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.639
- Just stick it in there so it's sticking out.
- All right.

21:57.749 --> 22:00.718
- Okay, go.
- One, two, three.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.718
It's still in there.

22:11.029 --> 22:14.055
- Jump back up.
- Do you want me to lift you on there?

22:15.033 --> 22:17.695
- Wait...
- Okay, fuckers!

22:18.170 --> 22:21.469
No, there's a machine in here
fucking doing it,

22:21.573 --> 22:23.734
you fucking fuckers.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.572
Where's the fucking
card-throwing machine?

22:29.281 --> 22:32.341
Where's the fucking
card-throwing machine, dude?

22:37.222 --> 22:39.690
Show him what it is.
Show him what's funny.

22:40.592 --> 22:43.618
Oh, the fucking chair's rigged!

22:47.866 --> 22:49.163
Oh, my God.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.966
There's a card-throwing machine
in here, dude.

22:58.076 --> 23:01.978
Dude, Wee Man, I would never use
a card-throwing machine on you.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.208
<i>That couldn't have gone any better.</i>

23:38.316 --> 23:40.716
<i>I didn't know that</i>
<i>Knoxville could do back flips.</i>

23:40.819 --> 23:42.912
<i>It was, like, a front flip.</i>

23:43.655 --> 23:46.556
- Where do yaks come from?
- That's from Siberia.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.891
So that's why Eskimos
don't have rodeos.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.089
Yeah.

23:55.233 --> 23:58.134
Tell me about your
original drawing for this.

23:58.236 --> 24:01.034
See, when I come up with my ideas,
I don't write them down.

24:01.139 --> 24:05.542
I just draw a picture
and fax it to Los Angeles.

24:05.644 --> 24:07.737
I just drew a picture of a fat-ass

24:07.846 --> 24:10.781
and a little guy
with a bungee cord connected.

24:11.750 --> 24:15.379
Jason, how do you compare this
kind of athleticism to what you guys do?

24:15.587 --> 24:17.111
You guys are
a hell of a lot more athletic than us

24:17.222 --> 24:19.383
and a lot crazier, too.

24:20.659 --> 24:22.786
Dude, look how nervous he is.

24:23.862 --> 24:26.695
We're here in Miami Beach
with Jason Taylor

24:26.798 --> 24:28.663
and this is the Bungee Jump.

24:31.903 --> 24:33.768
- Are you ready, Preston?
- Just go! Just go!

24:33.872 --> 24:37.069
Three, two, one...

24:43.648 --> 24:44.615
Yes!

24:44.716 --> 24:46.343
Yes! Yes! Yes!

24:46.451 --> 24:47.816
Oh, my God.

24:50.555 --> 24:53.422
- Preston.
- That worked perfect.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.658
- Did I yank you?
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

24:57.796 --> 25:01.698
Okay, I went down, I'm upside-down,
I see Preston coming.

25:01.967 --> 25:05.130
Once he was past me,
he pulled me down more.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.364
- So, like, I slammed the water.
- Oh, you were above the water?

25:07.472 --> 25:10.373
Yeah, I felt the full pressure
of the bungee.

25:11.109 --> 25:14.943
That was intense. Really intense.
Well, not really intense,

25:15.447 --> 25:17.142
but pretty intense.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.910
- What's your name again?
- What? Irving.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.420
- Irving, yeah.
- Irving Zisman.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.763
Hey, can we get some fries, please?

25:38.069 --> 25:39.627
Some time today.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.411
There you go. Take a sip.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.012
That'll put lead in your pencil, kid.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.618
You got a light?

26:04.429 --> 26:05.987
Shit.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.168
Hey, little guy, is that a real cigarette?

26:15.273 --> 26:17.468
- Piss off, man.
- Is it?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.339
He said, "Piss off!"

26:19.744 --> 26:20.870
Jesus.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.946
Here, Gramps.

26:23.481 --> 26:24.778
Thank you.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.190
Don't hog it all, you little prick.

26:34.459 --> 26:35.892
Give me that.

26:36.528 --> 26:38.553
- This is LA.
- What?

26:38.663 --> 26:40.290
- This is LA.
- Yeah?

26:40.532 --> 26:42.500
- Don't do what?
- We don't drink out in public.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.501
- You don't drink out in public?
- No.

26:44.603 --> 26:48.699
- Well, maybe you should start, bub.
- Yeah. Where are you guys from?

26:49.274 --> 26:51.401
- We're from your face.
- Yeah?

26:53.612 --> 26:56.137
- Mind your own business, asshole.
- What?

26:56.247 --> 26:58.272
I said,
"Mind your own business, asshole."

26:58.383 --> 27:01.580
- Okay, you'd better be quiet, buddy.
- What are you gonna do?

27:01.686 --> 27:05.178
- You wanna step outside?
- We're already outside, numbnuts.

27:06.825 --> 27:09.521
He asked me if I wanted to step outside.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.030
- You are from LA, ain't you, boy?
- Do you want to go around the block?

27:15.133 --> 27:16.828
Yeah, we'll go around the block.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.904
We'll go around the block
and see your mother.

27:20.071 --> 27:22.596
This is bullshit.
We're surrounded by cocksuckers.

27:22.707 --> 27:26.143
All right, kid.
It's time for Grandpa's massage.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.307
You get massages
with happy endings?

27:28.413 --> 27:29.573
That's right.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.445
- Say goodbye to the hippies.
- Bye, hippies.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.218
- Don't get beat up out here.
- "Beat up out here"?

27:36.321 --> 27:40.655
I don't have to worry about that in LA.
Not with you skinny sons of bitches.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.751
Okay, Old Man River.
Watch your mouth.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.564
I hear a lot of talking.

27:46.931 --> 27:50.765
You're letting that bulldog mouth
overload that puppy-dog ass.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.365
Look at him. Look how tough he is.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.133
You allow your nine-year-old son
to drink?

27:56.241 --> 27:58.573
- It's my grandson.
- I don't give a fuck.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.202
Wow, now you swear in front of him?
What kind of role model are you?

28:02.313 --> 28:03.974
What kind of role model are you?

28:04.082 --> 28:05.811
Get the fuck out of here
and go back to Mississippi.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.511
Step over this line.
Just step over that line.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.248
- Oh! You stepped over the line!
- I didn't step over a line.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.290
You stepped over the line.

28:13.825 --> 28:16.794
That long hair
don't cover that red neck, boy.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.058
Piss off!

28:20.565 --> 28:23.500
- Let's go.
- Go crawl back in your mama's ass!

28:25.970 --> 28:29.633
What the fuck is that?
What the hell is that?

28:29.741 --> 28:30.833
We're sledding.

28:30.975 --> 28:34.536
- Bam, what the hell are you doing?
- We're sledding.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.807
- Give me a ten!
- What about my floor?

28:43.755 --> 28:47.486
- How's your belly feeling, dude?
- I'm just a diarrhea machine.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.822
- Is it like a baby? Is it kicking?
- It's very similar to a baby.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.692
- Is it kicking?
- No, come on! No.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.731
Seriously, I'm not joking. Seriously.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.267
Are you gonna shit?
Wouldn't you feel better?

28:57.368 --> 28:59.233
We have a whole wardrobe van.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.862
I don't want a new wardrobe.
I just wanna not shit my pants.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.533
So, the boys think they're
arriving in a limo for a photo shoot,

29:04.642 --> 29:05.734
but little do they know,

29:05.844 --> 29:08.312
we have a shitload of bees
we're going to put through the sun roof.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.813
And we rigged the locks
so they can't get out.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.281
And when they do get out,
we got a couple of marbles for them.

29:13.818 --> 29:15.615
This is the Beehive Limo.

29:16.187 --> 29:19.816
<i>Last movie, you shit in a damn van</i>
<i>and now you get to shit in a limo.</i>

29:19.924 --> 29:23.792
<i>Yeah, you're stepping it up.</i>
<i>You're stepping it up, dude.</i>

29:28.566 --> 29:29.897
Oh, this isn't good.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.026
Dude, close that fucking sun roof, dude!

29:32.137 --> 29:34.196
Fuck! Fuck! We're locked in!

29:56.628 --> 29:58.562
Oh, my God, that sucks!

30:02.634 --> 30:04.966
They're fucking stinging my legs!

30:07.772 --> 30:11.503
Get the fuck off of me, dude!
You're getting them over here.

30:35.133 --> 30:37.761
You guys are fucking dicks, man. Fuck.

30:39.537 --> 30:40.970
They're on my feet!

30:47.412 --> 30:50.404
The poor driver's running around,
freaking out.

30:51.115 --> 30:52.639
That's so good.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.483
Sorry, bros.

30:55.053 --> 30:56.350
I pissed myself.

30:56.454 --> 30:59.446
One just got me, right now,
as we speak. Look at that.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.049
Fuck.

31:01.893 --> 31:05.829
- That was real funny, fuckers.
- Is there even a photo shoot?

31:07.832 --> 31:12.064
We're here with the Three 6 Mafia,
and it's time for the Rake Jump.

31:12.737 --> 31:13.897
Do it!

31:20.144 --> 31:21.543
What an idiot.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.642
I'm going to pay this motherfucker
right here 200 smackeroos,

31:26.985 --> 31:30.819
it's not counterfeit, it's real,
to eat horse shit.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.453
But it's all furry, though.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.185
- Eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

31:37.595 --> 31:39.358
Really eat it, though.
Chew, chew, chew!

31:39.464 --> 31:40.897
Swallow it!

31:40.999 --> 31:43.627
- Put your shades up!
- Hold the 200.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.102
- Come on, soldier!
- Don't even think about not swallowing.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.672
It's so dry!

31:50.942 --> 31:52.705
Don't even think about it!

31:52.810 --> 31:55.643
- Swallow it!
- Don't you even think about it.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.738
Don't you even think about it.

31:57.849 --> 32:00.613
- He ain't soft!
- Swallow it! Swallow it, nigga!

32:00.785 --> 32:04.448
Give him a beer, give him a beer.
Give it to him, give it to him!

32:04.756 --> 32:06.587
Really eat it, though.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.251
- I'm watching you.
- Yes, sir.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.424
Here, man.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.357
Dude, your breath smells like shit!

32:46.264 --> 32:50.200
We're here with Daniel Alvarez
from ALS Technologies and...

32:51.069 --> 32:53.333
Why don't you explain what this is
and what we're gonna be doing?

32:53.438 --> 32:56.134
Well, this is the 460 Stingmore Mine.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.573
It has approximately 700
.45-caliber rubber balls in it.

32:59.677 --> 33:02.237
They'll fly out of there
at about 500 feet per second.

33:02.347 --> 33:06.181
They use these charges
on the outside of embassies

33:06.384 --> 33:09.649
to protect the gates
from people trying to break in.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.585
- Looks like it's gonna suck.
- It is. I promise.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.157
Fire in the hole.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.596
- Fuck that, dude.
- Fucking Christ!

33:21.299 --> 33:22.766
That is great!

33:24.502 --> 33:27.266
I'm about to, like,
have an anxiety attack.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.765
I just can't do this one.
It's just too gnarly.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.772
Dude, Knoxville is...

33:33.144 --> 33:35.738
If Knoxville goes in there, dude,

33:37.515 --> 33:39.210
I'll French kiss him.

33:39.417 --> 33:42.181
- Are you insane?
- No. All you got to do is stand there.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.846
Yeah, and get killed. Look at that thing.
That thing blew the hell up.

33:44.956 --> 33:48.392
It's just loud. It's loud. It's going to hurt
really bad, but it's just loud.

33:48.493 --> 33:49.551
You're nuts.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.390
- No, no, no. Come on. It's footage.
- You're nuts.

34:07.745 --> 34:09.474
Son of a... Fuck you.

34:11.849 --> 34:13.612
Holy shit!

34:14.418 --> 34:17.877
<i>All you guys are fucking assholes.</i>

34:18.656 --> 34:20.715
- You all right, Bam?
- You all right?

34:20.824 --> 34:21.951
My God.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.620
- Are you crying?
- I think he's hurt.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.858
Can we give Bam some water?

34:28.199 --> 34:29.996
Maybe a Shirley Temple.

34:30.101 --> 34:33.070
I'm crying. I'm a fucking skateboarder
and I'm getting shot.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.303
They all went for my stomach.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.333
I got hit in the legs worse.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.973
Those... Did any get me in the face?

34:41.545 --> 34:44.174
You got hit in the stomach pretty good.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.143
- That was great.
- That was.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.946
- Thanks, fellows.
- Yeah. Appreciate it.

34:49.053 --> 34:50.645
Hey, is this okay?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.847
Then we're good.

34:57.962 --> 35:00.021
Do you like painting models?

35:00.565 --> 35:02.760
Yeah, but I don't need models
for this type of work.

35:02.867 --> 35:03.959
Okay.

35:04.669 --> 35:08.127
- It looks very vaginal and feminine.
- Well, thank you.

35:08.239 --> 35:09.570
- And sexual.
- Thank you.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.234
- Yes, thank you. It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

35:14.312 --> 35:16.940
It's time to play a game
with a bunch of these medicine balls.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.948
And they're heavy as shit.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.046
It's on!

35:23.454 --> 35:26.321
- This is Medicine Ball Dodgeball.
- In the dark.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.913
Can't see anything.

36:14.805 --> 36:18.434
- What did you think?
- That was fun. Let's never do that again.

36:18.543 --> 36:19.601
Ever!

36:23.481 --> 36:25.847
<i>Three, two, one!</i>

36:28.319 --> 36:29.286
Holy...

36:30.254 --> 36:33.052
Who'd want to do that?
You're not doing that.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.216
- Who's going first?
- What rhymes with Dunn?

36:35.326 --> 36:36.520
Fun.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.390
- Ready, sailor?
- No.

36:40.164 --> 36:43.361
- This is dumb.
- This is going to be dope.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.102
Oh, my gosh.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.327
Oh, my God. Oh, jeez.

36:48.439 --> 36:50.100
Get me out of this!

36:50.474 --> 36:52.339
You're a fucking dick.

36:52.577 --> 36:53.544
That was mean.

36:53.644 --> 36:54.611
He needs help.

36:54.745 --> 36:55.712
That was so mean.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.643
You are an asshole.

36:57.748 --> 37:00.683
That was totally not me.
I had nothing to do with it.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.217
You pulled it down!

37:02.320 --> 37:03.378
I didn't!

37:04.288 --> 37:06.722
Oh, my God, my hip. I think I gave birth.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.153
Hi, I'm John Waters,
and this is the Magic Trick.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.962
We're gonna make Wee Man disappear.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.197
Where'd he go?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.177
Very nice.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.050
That's great.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.517
You're the best magician ever, John.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.488
Thank you so much. Thank you.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.359
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville

37:47.465 --> 37:49.729
and I'm here with Mat Hoffman
and Tony Hawk

37:49.834 --> 37:51.597
and this is the Gauntlet.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.296
I just gave him a chest pass!

39:25.763 --> 39:27.230
Open the windows!

39:30.325 --> 39:32.190
This is the Toro Totter.

39:32.393 --> 39:35.260
It's me and Pontius vs. Dunn and Bam

39:35.864 --> 39:38.890
and the last man on the teeter-totter
is the winner.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.967
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

39:42.704 --> 39:43.864
Oh, yes!

39:57.685 --> 39:59.152
What did I do?

40:00.955 --> 40:02.183
What did I do?

40:14.469 --> 40:15.936
Dunn, stay there!

40:16.070 --> 40:18.231
So why did I agree to do this one?

40:28.616 --> 40:30.379
Ryan, run! Ryan, run!

40:30.985 --> 40:32.213
My God.

40:34.122 --> 40:35.180
Shit.

40:37.392 --> 40:39.360
Bam, where are you going?

40:39.794 --> 40:41.591
I am not doing that.

40:41.729 --> 40:43.026
Fuck that.

40:43.631 --> 40:45.030
Down to two!

40:46.200 --> 40:48.259
I got hit in the back good.

40:51.973 --> 40:54.373
Hey, Knoxville. Oh, shit!

40:54.542 --> 40:58.069
God damn it. Fucking shit. Fuck.

40:58.179 --> 41:00.647
- You all right?
- Yeah. Hold on.

41:00.815 --> 41:04.148
What do you mean, "Hold on"?
The bull's not going to hold on.

41:06.621 --> 41:09.488
Oh, my fucking leg!
God damn, these bulls are strong.

41:19.334 --> 41:20.323
Oh, God.

41:20.435 --> 41:22.232
I'm not out!

41:22.470 --> 41:23.835
Oh, my God.

41:25.974 --> 41:27.635
I'm still not out!

41:34.482 --> 41:36.712
All right, that's it. That's it.

42:07.615 --> 42:09.105
Oh, my God.

42:09.217 --> 42:11.310
Keep God out of California!

42:12.553 --> 42:15.613
Tell Charlie Daniels
to write a song about this!

42:15.923 --> 42:19.086
God is out! He can have the other 48.

42:19.527 --> 42:21.119
Or 49, whatever.

42:21.896 --> 42:26.731
God, I landed straight on my head.
Oh, man, that hurt.

42:27.502 --> 42:29.060
Dude, I'm fucked.

42:33.741 --> 42:36.232
I'm Steve-O and sorry, Dad,

42:36.344 --> 42:38.539
but nobody's going to miss this
for the world.

42:38.646 --> 42:40.273
This is the Butt Chug.

42:42.817 --> 42:44.114
Oh, no.

42:44.218 --> 42:46.880
- I'll hold this while you bulldog it.
- Get it in there.

42:46.988 --> 42:50.151
- Ram it in there.
- It's really got to get in there.

42:56.831 --> 42:59.391
- Open wide!
- Oh, my God.

43:01.302 --> 43:02.269
Take it.

43:02.370 --> 43:06.101
Just relax. Relax. Yeah, do your little...

43:06.207 --> 43:10.075
I'm staring right down Main Street.
It's not looking any good at all.

43:12.013 --> 43:13.412
You're starting to enjoy that, aren't you?

43:13.514 --> 43:16.779
- Oh, shit.
- There it goes! There it goes!

43:16.951 --> 43:18.748
- Keep it going.
- There we go.

43:19.854 --> 43:21.048
Chug, chug it!

43:21.155 --> 43:23.055
- Take it all!
- Oh, yeah!

43:23.157 --> 43:25.717
- Take it.
- I think your asshole's prehensile.

43:25.860 --> 43:27.794
You got it! You got it!

43:28.896 --> 43:33.856
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

43:38.072 --> 43:40.131
You got this! Keep on going!

43:40.708 --> 43:42.198
Come on, you've almost got it!

43:42.310 --> 43:43.971
Two more sips left.

43:50.918 --> 43:53.182
- Oh, my God.
- Give me a profile, Steve.

43:55.857 --> 43:57.825
He's peeing like a girl!

43:58.793 --> 44:00.886
Steve-O, if your asshole
can't see the camera,

44:00.995 --> 44:03.327
then the camera can't see your asshole.

44:04.499 --> 44:07.991
- The camera's over here!
- Right there, right there, right there.

44:08.569 --> 44:11.629
Look at Lance!
Lance can't stop laughing.

44:15.276 --> 44:18.905
He's doesn't know how to face
the cameras when he's peeing.

44:21.315 --> 44:22.680
Oh, my God.

44:24.519 --> 44:26.987
- I think we broke Lance.
- I know.

44:28.789 --> 44:31.349
I think I still have beer in my ass,
but I can't get it out.

44:31.459 --> 44:33.689
Use the bottle.
Put the bottle up your ass.

44:33.794 --> 44:36.854
- Use the plunger!
- Yeah, plunge his asshole.

44:37.098 --> 44:39.362
You'd better shit piss, asswipe!

44:56.384 --> 44:58.648
All right, let's go to the bar.

45:10.398 --> 45:11.558
Perfect.

45:12.133 --> 45:13.225
Fuck.

45:15.203 --> 45:17.671
I'm Ryan Dunn,
and this is the Rocket Cart.

45:17.772 --> 45:21.936
Five, four, three, two, one...

45:22.043 --> 45:23.032
Bye-bye.

45:35.456 --> 45:38.892
- <i>I think I broke my tailbone.</i>
- <i>Really? On the water?</i>

45:41.462 --> 45:44.659
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville
and this is the Anaconda Ball Pit.

45:45.299 --> 45:46.857
Oh, fuck!

45:48.069 --> 45:50.629
I have on a cup and that still hurts.

45:56.978 --> 46:00.141
Anacondas are expert at camouflage.
They're ambush hunters.

46:00.248 --> 46:02.910
- So, what does that mean?
- They surprise you.

46:03.017 --> 46:05.542
I don't know
if I'm gonna be that surprised.

46:05.653 --> 46:10.215
You guys got to catch these guys, man.
They tried to kill J-Lo and Ice Cube.

46:12.426 --> 46:14.189
Yeah, I know. I know.

46:15.563 --> 46:18.225
- Something in your mike?
- Don't fucking push me.

46:18.599 --> 46:19.896
I'm on your team.

46:24.105 --> 46:25.436
You got him.

46:28.643 --> 46:30.338
Get the other camera.

46:31.512 --> 46:32.479
Grab him.

46:34.015 --> 46:34.982
Fuck!

46:37.385 --> 46:38.352
Oh, man.

46:38.519 --> 46:40.544
- Dude, he is bleeding a lot.
- Yeah.

46:40.655 --> 46:42.316
He's starting to smell you guys.

46:42.423 --> 46:44.891
Dude, you guys are doing excellent.

46:45.159 --> 46:47.150
Real good. You guys got it.

46:47.261 --> 46:48.728
Get him. You got him.

46:52.433 --> 46:54.128
Got him! You guys got him.

46:54.268 --> 46:56.736
Oh, no, Dunn's getting coiled. Oh, shit.

46:57.405 --> 46:59.600
Get your fucking hands off me!

47:07.948 --> 47:09.848
You guys have been doing good.

47:09.950 --> 47:12.384
- Where'd his head go?
- He's buried.

47:15.990 --> 47:17.651
- You got him!
- Yeah!

47:18.225 --> 47:20.420
- I have seized the snake.
- Yeah.

47:23.230 --> 47:25.357
It's fucking wrapped around my arm.

47:30.404 --> 47:32.838
Just take him to Manny.
Take him to Manny.

47:32.940 --> 47:34.908
Hey, Manny, come here a minute.

47:37.011 --> 47:38.740
I got him.

47:42.083 --> 47:43.846
Oh, my God, you got nailed.

47:43.951 --> 47:45.919
I didn't do anything. He did all the work.

47:46.020 --> 47:48.284
All right. We seized the snake.

47:49.924 --> 47:51.448
Run, Ryan, run.

47:53.661 --> 47:56.425
Oh, shit.
We forgot about the other snake.

48:13.180 --> 48:14.875
This is the Ice Horse.

48:15.015 --> 48:18.075
See if your balls will stick to the horse.

48:18.185 --> 48:19.982
- Come on!
- You want me to do it?

48:20.087 --> 48:21.145
For the bros.

48:21.555 --> 48:23.250
It's for the bros. Come on.

48:23.357 --> 48:25.655
- It's not gonna stick.
- Yeah, it can stick.

48:25.760 --> 48:27.887
You just need a little water.

48:28.329 --> 48:30.229
Anybody got some water?

48:31.832 --> 48:33.823
- Great.
- Thanks!

48:33.934 --> 48:35.993
Don't think about it. Just do it.

48:36.137 --> 48:37.729
You are assholes.

48:40.341 --> 48:42.206
God, your legs are white.

48:42.309 --> 48:45.710
Here. You've got to really
get the water on the balls.

48:47.515 --> 48:50.484
Oh, that's horrible-looking!

49:02.229 --> 49:03.958
It's yanking my hair!

49:05.733 --> 49:07.166
Are you done?

49:09.403 --> 49:10.961
- What an ass!
- Oh, my God!

49:11.739 --> 49:13.570
It ripped my skin off.

49:14.875 --> 49:16.638
Look at the blister.

49:17.011 --> 49:18.308
Look at him gallop.

49:19.013 --> 49:22.505
Hey! There's poop, hair and more poop!

49:26.220 --> 49:28.780
I'm Wee Man,
and this is the Swamp Chute.

49:45.606 --> 49:47.233
Holy shit, dude. You all right?

49:47.341 --> 49:49.332
What? I can't hear, kind of.

49:49.443 --> 49:51.104
"I can't hear, kind of"!

49:51.212 --> 49:53.373
<i>You skipped across the water</i>
<i>like a rock.</i>

49:53.481 --> 49:56.644
<i>Dude, you were at least</i>
<i>an 80-mile-an-hour fastball.</i>

49:57.051 --> 49:58.313
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

49:58.619 --> 50:01.452
When you step into this suit,
magic happens.

50:04.959 --> 50:07.325
Today, we're in Carmen de Arrico

50:07.428 --> 50:10.522
with our friend Serg,
and he is going to show us

50:10.631 --> 50:11.928
how to milk a horse.

50:12.466 --> 50:14.024
The way we're gonna do that is,

50:14.134 --> 50:17.968
they're gonna bring over a stallion
who's gonna be hot to trot.

50:18.239 --> 50:19.968
And they're gonna have the mare here.

50:20.074 --> 50:22.474
And as soon as the stallion
mounts the mare,

50:22.576 --> 50:25.067
we're going to grab the stallion's penis

50:25.379 --> 50:28.007
and put it into this fake horse vagina.

50:28.349 --> 50:30.044
The old switcheroo.

50:30.217 --> 50:31.878
What a mean trick.

50:32.786 --> 50:35.277
- Here we go.
- Here comes the stallion.

50:36.123 --> 50:38.353
He's got the craziest look in his eye.

50:38.459 --> 50:41.360
I've seen that same look
in your eye, Pontius.

50:41.729 --> 50:43.321
It's game on, guys.

50:46.166 --> 50:47.997
Oh, boy. Here we go. Here we go.

50:49.503 --> 50:50.629
Oh, boy.

50:51.772 --> 50:55.037
Okay. We got the penis
into the fake horsy vagina.

50:56.377 --> 50:58.572
I think I feel the tip of it.

50:58.679 --> 51:00.704
Somebody cradle the balls.

51:08.956 --> 51:11.322
He lasts longer than you, Steve-O.

51:12.927 --> 51:14.155
Success!

51:15.729 --> 51:18.789
- Oh, my God.
- He just pleasured a horse.

51:21.235 --> 51:22.930
Is it okay to drink?

51:24.905 --> 51:25.997
Yeah.

51:26.106 --> 51:27.334
No problem.

51:28.442 --> 51:31.934
If I do this, this gives me an out
for something bad

51:32.079 --> 51:33.046
I'm going to do in the future.

51:33.147 --> 51:34.307
Absolutely. Absolutely.

51:34.415 --> 51:36.610
- All right. It's on video.
- Okay.

51:36.917 --> 51:38.885
That is such a huge load.

51:39.286 --> 51:42.084
I don't know, man.
I could have pictured...

51:45.593 --> 51:47.652
Can you test that out?

51:58.806 --> 52:00.740
That's semen, all right.

52:04.445 --> 52:07.881
I never puke, ever,
and I really almost puked then.

52:08.749 --> 52:10.546
I'm ashamed of myself.

52:10.884 --> 52:12.249
I really am.

52:12.553 --> 52:14.885
I'm completely ashamed of myself.

52:16.490 --> 52:19.323
- Ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Are you ready?

52:19.460 --> 52:22.190
You're not going to
break through, anyway.

52:25.566 --> 52:27.227
Pontius, you think
you can do two boards?

52:27.334 --> 52:28.323
Yeah.

52:28.435 --> 52:31.336
What's Bruce Lee do?
That power-breathing.

52:31.672 --> 52:33.230
I think I got it.

52:40.414 --> 52:41.711
Oh, my God!

52:47.254 --> 52:49.222
I was so not ready for that!

52:51.625 --> 52:52.853
We're at the Widowmaker

52:52.993 --> 52:55.154
and this is the Big Tire Race.

52:59.133 --> 53:00.657
- I can't get in this thing.
- Yes, you can.

53:00.768 --> 53:02.827
I guarantee you're getting in it.

53:04.405 --> 53:05.565
Oh, crap.

53:05.739 --> 53:07.138
- On your mark!
- Fuck!

53:07.841 --> 53:09.240
Get set! Go!

53:09.343 --> 53:11.402
- You are fucked.
- Oh, shit!

53:34.835 --> 53:36.234
I'm stuck in here!

53:36.336 --> 53:37.303
Dude.

53:37.404 --> 53:39.031
We got you, buddy.

53:41.008 --> 53:43.442
I hate that. I hate it so bad!

53:44.478 --> 53:45.502
Fucking sucky.

53:45.612 --> 53:49.070
- Why do you hate it?
- I'm bouncing in my fucking head.

53:49.883 --> 53:52.147
- You got it, Ehren.
- Here, Ehren.

53:53.821 --> 53:57.450
- Jesus Christ, you got a fat fucking ass.
- You got to help!

54:01.328 --> 54:02.295
Oh, fuck!

54:04.865 --> 54:07.129
We're here in India
and we found a leech healer

54:07.234 --> 54:09.065
and these boys need a little healing.

54:09.369 --> 54:11.894
- Doc, can you help us?
- Yeah, why not?

54:21.014 --> 54:22.845
That sounds good.
Let's put one on Dave's nut.

54:27.821 --> 54:29.482
Well, don't hand it to me.

54:30.858 --> 54:31.825
All right, gentlemen.

54:32.092 --> 54:34.117
That's the biggest leech I ever saw.

54:34.228 --> 54:36.253
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

54:43.537 --> 54:45.095
- Oh, my God.
- My God.

54:46.473 --> 54:47.462
No!

54:51.845 --> 54:53.335
He's on. He's on.

54:54.047 --> 54:55.378
He's on. He's on.

54:56.283 --> 54:57.682
Fuck! Shit!

54:57.785 --> 54:58.911
Help.

55:01.488 --> 55:04.013
You got to leave it on for a while.

55:05.325 --> 55:06.622
Fuck this.

55:07.194 --> 55:09.059
You got to leave it on.

55:09.763 --> 55:11.424
You got to let...

55:12.466 --> 55:13.865
Fucking shit.

55:14.401 --> 55:16.198
Please, take it off me.

55:16.470 --> 55:18.734
- Please, will you take it off me?
- All right, I'm gonna take it off!

55:18.839 --> 55:19.806
Please.

55:19.940 --> 55:21.430
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Take it off.

55:21.542 --> 55:22.941
- Just get it off me.
- This is gonna be so funny.

55:23.043 --> 55:24.943
Just get it the fuck off me.

55:31.251 --> 55:33.378
Wait, let's see what you got.

55:34.054 --> 55:35.146
Fuck you!

55:36.123 --> 55:37.090
Fuck!

55:40.260 --> 55:43.696
And now for the grand finale,
the leech monocle.

55:46.166 --> 55:47.428
Thanks, Doc.

55:47.534 --> 55:49.627
- Jesus Christ.
- Look over here. Look over here.

55:49.736 --> 55:52.170
Okay, this is the mouth.

55:53.073 --> 55:54.165
Here we go.

55:56.476 --> 55:57.738
Get him on there.

55:57.845 --> 55:59.676
Come on, leech.

56:07.187 --> 56:08.882
Oh, he's eyeballing you.

56:08.989 --> 56:09.978
I think we'd...

56:10.090 --> 56:11.250
He's on my eyeball!

56:11.358 --> 56:12.848
No, wait, wait!

56:13.727 --> 56:16.252
Okay, stand up and keep your eye open.

56:16.630 --> 56:19.622
Keep your eye open.
Keep your eye open, Steve-O!

56:19.800 --> 56:21.461
Steve-O, keep your eye open! Open!

56:21.602 --> 56:23.536
Open! Open, toward... No!

56:23.637 --> 56:24.661
Look!

56:25.539 --> 56:26.972
Relax. Relax.

56:37.851 --> 56:39.182
Does it look cool?

56:39.286 --> 56:41.652
Yeah. It got you about right there.

56:41.755 --> 56:44.155
I just had a leech chomp my eyeball.

56:44.258 --> 56:45.282
Yes!

56:46.026 --> 56:47.288
Way to go.

56:50.731 --> 56:52.323
Are these all for sale today?

56:52.432 --> 56:53.831
Yeah. $5.

56:53.934 --> 56:56.334
Oh, why, they're beautiful shirts.

56:56.737 --> 56:58.637
They're beautiful colors.

56:59.439 --> 57:01.270
This one's really nice.

57:08.615 --> 57:10.845
- Do you think that...
- Oh, shit.

57:11.285 --> 57:13.185
I'd like to buy, maybe, the one...

57:13.287 --> 57:14.652
Hey, your titty out.

57:14.755 --> 57:17.189
- What's that?
- He said your shirt is open.

57:18.458 --> 57:19.584
Put this shirt on?

57:19.693 --> 57:20.785
No, your shirt...

57:20.894 --> 57:23.795
Your thing is hanging out of your
shirt, ma'am. What are you doing?

57:23.897 --> 57:25.762
Put your shirt back on.

57:25.966 --> 57:27.957
Which one was the one you thought
I should get?

57:28.068 --> 57:29.035
Leave me alone!

57:31.905 --> 57:33.702
Bam is absolutely terrified of snakes,

57:33.807 --> 57:36.367
so we brought David Weathers here
to surprise him during the next bit.

57:37.477 --> 57:38.739
King cobra.

57:39.046 --> 57:40.172
Jesus...

57:41.715 --> 57:43.012
Oh, my God.

57:43.283 --> 57:45.478
It's cool. It's been de-venomized.

57:51.725 --> 57:54.250
I'm Bam Margera
and this is the Wind Tunnel.

58:06.573 --> 58:08.404
Oh, my God. What?

58:14.681 --> 58:16.649
Bam, cock out. Cock out.

58:17.117 --> 58:19.085
No, no, no! No, no!

58:20.821 --> 58:22.652
A fucking cobra, dude?

58:25.892 --> 58:28.986
Yo, yo, yo, I don't like him
staring like that.

58:29.329 --> 58:32.162
Oh, dude, you guys
are fucking such total dickheads.

58:34.634 --> 58:36.761
- Are you crying?
- Yeah.

58:37.070 --> 58:39.732
Oh, yeah!

58:41.074 --> 58:42.200
He's on to you.

58:49.449 --> 58:50.507
I'm done.

58:50.617 --> 58:53.415
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

58:53.987 --> 58:55.784
Dave, Dave!

59:02.496 --> 59:05.624
Yo, that is coolest shit
I've seen in long time.

59:05.732 --> 59:07.825
White boy don't like snakes.

59:08.201 --> 59:09.168
Eh?

59:11.238 --> 59:12.637
What's your strategy up there?

59:12.739 --> 59:16.038
My strategy is staying up on the fucking
van because I don't trust anybody.

59:16.143 --> 59:18.805
I should have thought about it more,
but I was sipping on beer.

59:18.912 --> 59:22.313
I was like, "Why the fuck is snake dude
in Louisiana?"

59:22.582 --> 59:24.413
Then I do my bit
and then all of a sudden

59:24.518 --> 59:26.213
a king cobra comes
into the fucking thing.

59:26.319 --> 59:28.879
I'm like... Dude, I'm staying up here.

59:31.425 --> 59:34.292
You fuckers are asses.
I don't trust anybody.

59:34.828 --> 59:36.523
And you made me waste my beer.

59:45.639 --> 59:47.698
- Fucking hell.
- Fuck this.

59:49.743 --> 59:52.541
I'm Steve-O, and this is the Fart Mask.

01:00:20.373 --> 01:00:22.204
I took a fucking shit in it!

01:00:26.713 --> 01:00:28.305
There's shit in there.

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:32.216
I got a shitty ass. I got to go wipe it out.

01:00:32.319 --> 01:00:34.310
That's like, the perfect poop.

01:00:35.856 --> 01:00:38.882
I'm Dave England
and this is my big, green ball.

01:00:51.438 --> 01:00:54.168
I need you to put baby powder

01:00:54.274 --> 01:00:55.605
in my butt hole.

01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:56.869
You need me to put...

01:00:58.712 --> 01:01:01.272
- Put a lot in there.
- Yeah, yeah. That's great.

01:01:22.369 --> 01:01:23.836
Who was that?

01:01:26.106 --> 01:01:27.733
Did it go "poof"?

01:01:27.841 --> 01:01:29.138
Did it go "poof"?

01:01:29.576 --> 01:01:30.736
It did?

01:01:49.863 --> 01:01:50.921
Sorry.

01:01:59.372 --> 01:02:00.634
Oh, sorry.

01:02:07.714 --> 01:02:10.410
Do you have these in size 11?

01:02:19.492 --> 01:02:21.016
Let me just see.

01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:22.828
These are good.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.629
- Sir!
- Leave me alone!

01:02:36.476 --> 01:02:38.137
You come on in here.

01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:44.315
You go that way. I don't care, dude.

01:02:44.618 --> 01:02:45.710
Police!

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.200
He's a frisky little bugger!

01:03:35.302 --> 01:03:36.769
I am so sorry!

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.770
Oh, my God!
It reminded me of my ex-wife!

01:03:42.976 --> 01:03:45.069
It's the middle of the night.

01:03:45.178 --> 01:03:48.670
We're gonna wake up Phil
and swap him with Preston,

01:03:48.848 --> 01:03:51.043
and Ape's gonna lose her mind.

01:03:51.184 --> 01:03:53.015
This is the Switcheroo.

01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:58.848
It's all right.

01:04:56.216 --> 01:04:58.377
Don't be afraid to get frisky.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:39.356
I'm gonna kill you in a minute.

01:05:39.726 --> 01:05:41.216
Phil, back up.

01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:44.023
Back up!

01:05:45.832 --> 01:05:47.060
Back up.

01:05:47.901 --> 01:05:50.165
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

01:05:53.373 --> 01:05:56.137
Are you all right? Jesus Christ.
Are you...

01:05:57.076 --> 01:05:58.407
Are you...

01:06:00.113 --> 01:06:01.137
Phil?

01:06:01.247 --> 01:06:02.305
Phil?

01:06:02.649 --> 01:06:03.707
Phil?

01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:06.785
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:06:06.886 --> 01:06:08.251
- What?
- What?

01:06:08.955 --> 01:06:11.515
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:06:12.358 --> 01:06:13.689
Oh, my God!

01:06:14.794 --> 01:06:17.194
Who is that? Who is that?

01:06:17.831 --> 01:06:19.230
Who is that?

01:06:19.532 --> 01:06:22.968
That's not your dad. Who is that?
Who is that? Where's the light?

01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:25.128
- How you doing, ma'am?
- What? Who?

01:06:28.274 --> 01:06:30.902
I went to get a drink. What's going on?

01:06:33.313 --> 01:06:34.610
Oh, my God!

01:06:35.648 --> 01:06:37.912
Man, I just felt like
I was committing assault.

01:06:38.017 --> 01:06:39.848
Phil, he copped a feel.

01:06:40.153 --> 01:06:42.178
He got away with it, then.

01:06:43.523 --> 01:06:46.321
Have you ever been
with another man before?

01:06:47.093 --> 01:06:48.788
Did he feel fatter?

01:06:49.395 --> 01:06:51.090
Did he feel fatter?

01:06:51.698 --> 01:06:53.928
You can answer. I won't be mad.

01:06:54.033 --> 01:06:56.763
I just assaulted you!
You can say whatever you want!

01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:58.633
No, you felt shorter.

01:06:58.738 --> 01:07:01.536
- No, you can say anything you want.
- You felt that part?

01:07:03.576 --> 01:07:06.067
That's it. I'm going to bed now.

01:07:23.696 --> 01:07:25.027
Oh, Jesus.

01:07:27.066 --> 01:07:28.397
Oh, shit.

01:07:28.968 --> 01:07:32.096
What was that shit?
It's fucking in my eyes.

01:07:36.342 --> 01:07:38.207
What the fuck was that?

01:07:38.311 --> 01:07:39.278
<i>Oh, my...</i>

01:07:39.579 --> 01:07:41.479
<i>I fucking don't understand.</i>

01:07:42.148 --> 01:07:44.343
<i>What the fuck did you do to me?</i>

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:46.042
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

01:07:46.653 --> 01:07:48.450
That fucked me up, man.

01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:50.352
Let's go inside, man.

01:07:53.693 --> 01:07:54.717
- Are you okay?
- Oh, fuck, dude.

01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:57.489
Let's get inside. We got a medic inside.

01:08:07.073 --> 01:08:11.476
It's moments like these when you know
Johnny Knoxville is one gnarly dude.

01:08:15.114 --> 01:08:17.877
I'm so glad
I'm not the star of this movie.

01:08:19.452 --> 01:08:23.149
Knoxville's gonna see
what the moon's gonna look like.

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:27.020
He is gonna go definitely 60 feet up
in the air.

01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:30.421
He's gonna get annihilated.
But I don't wanna tell him that.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:32.622
You're gonna be just fine!

01:08:33.433 --> 01:08:36.732
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and this is my Big Red Rocket.

01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:40.962
Five, four, three, two, one...

01:08:41.073 --> 01:08:42.063
Go.

01:08:47.981 --> 01:08:51.041
What the fuck was that?

01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:54.176
Holy shit!

01:08:54.287 --> 01:08:57.120
Oh, my God, he almost died
and he's dancing.

01:08:57.390 --> 01:09:00.553
<i>Usually, rockets fail backwards</i>
<i>and forwards, I was told,</i>

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.060
<i>but there was a rocket</i>
<i>that came out the side.</i>

01:09:03.162 --> 01:09:05.528
If it had been, like, right here,

01:09:05.631 --> 01:09:08.725
that would have been a picture wrap
on old Knoxville.

01:09:10.036 --> 01:09:12.630
And now we're trying it again.
It's rocket launch, take two.

01:09:12.738 --> 01:09:14.673
I'm scared just watching.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.372
- I want a Lance helmet.
- I have full, like, adrenaline.

01:09:19.511 --> 01:09:22.537
<i>Even if the rocket doesn't blow up</i>
<i>on me this time,</i>

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:26.345
<i>there's really not a lot of great ways</i>
<i>for it to end, anyway.</i>

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:30.620
- This isn't the best idea ever.
- Yes, it is.

01:09:31.024 --> 01:09:34.357
I'm Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm going to the moon!

01:09:34.493 --> 01:09:38.794
Five, four, three, two, one...

01:09:38.898 --> 01:09:39.990
Later!

01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:52.910
Are you okay?

01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:54.809
Give us a thumbs-up!

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.621
So what's going on, Preston?
What are we doing today?

01:10:13.733 --> 01:10:16.998
We're playing a prank on Danger Ehren.

01:10:17.103 --> 01:10:20.129
I think that we're gonna
decorate him up like a terrorist,

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:22.366
with full makeup and wardrobe,

01:10:22.475 --> 01:10:25.171
and him and Dimitry
are gonna call a cab,

01:10:25.278 --> 01:10:28.441
the idea being to play a prank
on the taxi driver,

01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:30.048
that they wanna go to the airport,

01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:32.174
I guess to commit
some sort of terrorist act.

01:10:32.285 --> 01:10:34.412
- So, Ehren, where are you going?
- Yeah, where are you going?

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.283
I'm going to Burbank Airport.

01:10:36.589 --> 01:10:41.424
And, meanwhile, we've substituted
the taxi driver with Jay Chandrasekhar...

01:10:41.928 --> 01:10:46.126
And he is going to punch Ehren in
the face and possibly pull a gun on him.

01:10:46.232 --> 01:10:47.358
If he tries to say we're filming,

01:10:47.467 --> 01:10:49.697
just go, "Don't talk to me anymore!"

01:10:49.802 --> 01:10:52.999
And slap him like this.
You can slap him a lot, too.

01:10:54.874 --> 01:10:58.310
I don't know how he'll handle this.
It's pretty high-pressure.

01:10:58.411 --> 01:11:00.538
And I don't think
he does well under pressure.

01:11:01.647 --> 01:11:02.739
All right, so here I am

01:11:03.015 --> 01:11:05.984
trying to contribute
to Ehren McGhehey's new beard.

01:11:07.019 --> 01:11:09.886
And I hope he knows that I skipped
showering for about a week and a half

01:11:09.989 --> 01:11:12.787
just to make this a little bit more gross.

01:11:13.893 --> 01:11:15.326
Sorry, Ehren.

01:11:22.535 --> 01:11:24.264
Look at the mane on him!

01:11:25.805 --> 01:11:28.774
Someone's got to pick that
out of their teeth.

01:11:29.675 --> 01:11:32.701
I'd be so bummed
if I was Ehren right now.

01:11:32.812 --> 01:11:34.439
You, like, put powder in there?

01:11:34.547 --> 01:11:36.879
Yeah, I put a little Gold Bond on
this morning.

01:11:36.983 --> 01:11:38.177
Tickles!

01:11:39.185 --> 01:11:42.211
One of the most toxic concoctions
known to man.

01:11:42.388 --> 01:11:44.117
It's a disease nest.

01:11:45.892 --> 01:11:48.019
Mine, you don't need a lot of.

01:11:48.594 --> 01:11:51.085
It's like just a little bit of
rattlesnake venom will get you.

01:11:51.197 --> 01:11:53.131
Is that the whole patch?

01:11:53.266 --> 01:11:55.666
Wait, I'm just wondering.
Mike, is that a crab?

01:11:55.768 --> 01:11:58.760
- What's that white speck on top?
- What is that?

01:11:59.372 --> 01:12:00.430
That's a crab.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:02.337
Mike's got crabs.

01:12:02.441 --> 01:12:04.875
Hey, guys! Guys! Mike's got crabs!

01:12:06.045 --> 01:12:07.103
What's that?

01:12:07.213 --> 01:12:09.238
This? Spirit gum. It's like, the adhesive

01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:10.906
that's gonna keep the beard on.

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:15.211
How's the dialog? I mean,
I've never, like, done this before.

01:12:15.321 --> 01:12:17.789
- It's a game, you know.
- Compliment him, followed by an insult.

01:12:17.890 --> 01:12:20.120
- This is fucked, dude.
- Just don't break the character.

01:12:20.226 --> 01:12:21.454
All right, Ehren, the main thing,

01:12:21.561 --> 01:12:24.189
you cannot tell him you're
from any country in particular.

01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:26.527
This is such a good bit.
It's muffed up, but it's great.

01:12:26.632 --> 01:12:28.623
Close your mouth. Relax.

01:12:28.734 --> 01:12:30.201
We're making you look like

01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:32.430
what we think this guy
expects a terrorist to look like.

01:12:32.538 --> 01:12:35.405
You're not making fun of anybody.
We're just trying to scare the cab driver.

01:12:35.508 --> 01:12:36.873
I kind of already know that.

01:12:36.976 --> 01:12:38.967
Father. Hello, Father.

01:12:39.078 --> 01:12:41.046
You shut up.
I told you to come here earlier.

01:12:41.147 --> 01:12:44.241
- I'm sorry, Father.
- You are late. You cannot be accepted.

01:12:44.584 --> 01:12:45.608
I have disgraced you.

01:12:45.718 --> 01:12:47.276
Where have you been,
you little bastard?

01:12:47.386 --> 01:12:50.048
- I have been making a number two.
- Oh.

01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:53.282
Ehren, you are king.

01:12:53.693 --> 01:12:55.422
Thank you very much.

01:12:58.331 --> 01:13:01.664
What are you laughing at?
You people, you.

01:13:01.767 --> 01:13:03.496
Bam Margera and shit.

01:13:03.603 --> 01:13:05.833
Look how sweet the beard is, Jeff.

01:13:05.938 --> 01:13:07.030
Hello.

01:13:08.674 --> 01:13:11.541
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:13:12.745 --> 01:13:17.546
I look creepy, man.
I wish that I was born this way.

01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:21.845
You sound like schtick now.
Don't turn it into a comedy routine.

01:13:21.954 --> 01:13:24.354
No, very good. I know what to do now.

01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:25.685
No, I think there's gonna be some...

01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:27.918
So, we have two cameras following...

01:13:28.027 --> 01:13:29.324
Excuse me.

01:13:29.528 --> 01:13:30.620
Hello?

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:34.097
I'd like to say, for not ever having
done makeup before your disguise,

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.191
I feel pretty...
Like I've achieved something.

01:13:36.302 --> 01:13:38.862
I feel like I'm eating pubes right now.

01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:41.269
I got this shit all in my mouth.

01:13:42.008 --> 01:13:44.841
- Is it on the corner?
- Yes, it's like I'm chewing on this shit.

01:13:44.944 --> 01:13:47.174
- Is this real hair?
- No. Go like this.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.975
I'm going to get it out of your mouth.

01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:50.548
Okay. Does that feel better?

01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.551
Well, I still got it
on the back of my tongue.

01:13:53.886 --> 01:13:55.717
There. Out?

01:13:56.055 --> 01:13:57.682
Yeah, very good.

01:13:58.257 --> 01:14:00.157
- Very expert.
- Thank you.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.724
Hello, my name is Ehren McGhehey
and this is Terror Taxi.

01:14:07.934 --> 01:14:09.902
Now I shall call to taxi.

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:14.701
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the best skit of this movie.

01:14:21.681 --> 01:14:23.979
The cab's here. We're on. We're on.
Let's do it.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:25.607
- He has no clue.
- I don't want the makeup to bleed.

01:14:29.855 --> 01:14:34.315
- We get to listen the whole time?
- I'm so glad I hopped in this van.

01:14:35.127 --> 01:14:36.685
Oh, my God.

01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:40.826
He's feeling the part so hard
and he has no clue.

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:44.260
It's all downhill from here.

01:14:49.308 --> 01:14:51.572
To the Burbank Airport, please.

01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:55.938
Okay.

01:14:57.083 --> 01:15:01.019
- Where are you guys from?
- It's none of your business, I'm sorry.

01:15:04.323 --> 01:15:05.756
You got any luggage or...

01:15:05.858 --> 01:15:08.053
No, no luggage where we going.

01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:11.789
I do not like this country
very much, though.

01:15:11.897 --> 01:15:15.333
I like the countryside, though.
The countryside is good.

01:15:16.402 --> 01:15:17.926
And the breasts.

01:15:18.371 --> 01:15:19.861
Yeah, I'm married.

01:15:19.972 --> 01:15:22.065
What size is your wife's breasts?

01:15:22.174 --> 01:15:24.039
Yeah, well, let's just leave my wife
out of it, okay?

01:15:24.143 --> 01:15:25.906
Very good, very good.

01:15:26.245 --> 01:15:28.304
Are they bigger than a D?

01:15:28.647 --> 01:15:29.875
I love Ds.

01:15:30.449 --> 01:15:32.610
Do you want me to fucking pull over?
I mean, is that the fuck...

01:15:32.718 --> 01:15:35.186
No. I'm very sorry. I will not talk.

01:15:37.857 --> 01:15:39.415
There's an airplane, there!

01:15:39.525 --> 01:15:41.425
We are very, very close.

01:15:42.395 --> 01:15:44.488
Boom! We are very, very close.

01:15:44.597 --> 01:15:45.655
What does that mean, "Boom"?

01:15:45.765 --> 01:15:48.734
Boom! Like, "Boom! Kaboom!"
And all that.

01:15:50.036 --> 01:15:52.368
There is the airport back there.
Which way are you going?

01:15:52.471 --> 01:15:55.201
Where you going? Where are
you going? Where are you going?

01:15:55.307 --> 01:15:57.502
Where are you going, man?
Where are you going?

01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:01.011
Do not go down the alleyway.
Very scary. Stop it! Fuck you!

01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:04.241
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You are a crazy man. Fuck you up!

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:05.942
Fuck you! Asshole!

01:16:06.052 --> 01:16:08.953
Shit fucker! Shit fucker! Asshole!

01:16:09.055 --> 01:16:11.319
Fucking money, I give you money,
lots of money!

01:16:11.424 --> 01:16:15.155
Boom! Boom! Boom!
I'll blow us up right now!

01:16:15.294 --> 01:16:17.888
Right now! Right now I'll blow you up!

01:16:17.997 --> 01:16:19.396
What the fuck is up, man?

01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:19.732
What the fuck is going on?
He's got a fucking gun, man.

01:16:19.732 --> 01:16:22.257
What the fuck is going on?
He's got a fucking gun, man.

01:16:22.368 --> 01:16:23.801
I got a bomb, dude!

01:16:23.936 --> 01:16:26.404
Fuck you! I got a fucking bomb, dude!

01:16:27.206 --> 01:16:28.867
Dude, get the fuck off of me!

01:16:28.974 --> 01:16:31.135
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off of me!

01:16:31.243 --> 01:16:33.803
We're just filming a skit!

01:16:33.913 --> 01:16:35.744
Get the fuck off of me!

01:16:38.818 --> 01:16:40.251
- What do you want me to do?
- Get on the floor.

01:16:40.352 --> 01:16:42.445
- What do you want me to do?
- Get on the fucking floor.

01:16:42.555 --> 01:16:44.022
Just get on the floor, dude.

01:16:44.123 --> 01:16:45.385
Lay down.

01:16:45.691 --> 01:16:47.124
This is fucked.

01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:48.591
Lay down on your face.

01:16:48.694 --> 01:16:50.753
What the fuck, dude? I mean, come on!

01:16:50.863 --> 01:16:54.390
I fucking knew it, dude. He fucking
carries a gun. This is bullshit.

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:56.968
Just do what he says.
Just do what the fuck he says, dude.

01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:01.162
Stay there.
I'm gonna fucking call the cops.

01:17:01.373 --> 01:17:03.568
This guy's got a fucking gun, dumbshits!

01:17:03.676 --> 01:17:05.974
Come on! Get the fuck out here!

01:17:06.312 --> 01:17:07.574
Don't fucking move!

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.341
Don't point the gun at me anymore,
you piece of shit!

01:17:09.448 --> 01:17:10.472
Then lay down!

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.483
- Fuck!
- Just fucking relax, dude.

01:17:12.585 --> 01:17:14.143
Fuck, it's a gun, dude.

01:17:14.253 --> 01:17:15.311
Fuck!

01:17:15.421 --> 01:17:17.048
- What the fuck do you want from us?
- Get up!

01:17:17.156 --> 01:17:18.350
Get up, Ehren. Get the fuck up.

01:17:18.457 --> 01:17:21.358
Why? Why should I get up?
You have me on the fucking ground.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:22.654
Ehren, he has a fucking gun.

01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:25.594
Just get the fuck up, dude.
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

01:17:25.698 --> 01:17:27.290
- Get in there.
- No, fuck you.

01:17:27.399 --> 01:17:30.857
- Just do what he says, dude.
- Get the fuck in the trunk.

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.301
He's got a fucking gun pointed at me,
fuckface, asshole, cocksucker!

01:17:34.406 --> 01:17:37.204
- Get in the fucking trunk!
- Dude, get in the trunk.

01:17:37.309 --> 01:17:40.244
If you fuck me up, I will fucking find you,
somehow, or something.

01:17:40.346 --> 01:17:41.540
- Just get in.
- Seriously.

01:17:41.647 --> 01:17:44.411
Why am I getting in the fucking back
of this fucking cab, dude?

01:17:44.517 --> 01:17:46.917
- He's got a fucking gun!
- Get the fuck back here!

01:17:47.019 --> 01:17:48.418
Dude, just fucking put the gun down!

01:17:48.521 --> 01:17:50.216
You shut the fuck up!

01:17:51.056 --> 01:17:52.353
- Oh fuck, dude!
- Holy shit!

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:55.621
- What the fuck, dude?
- Get the fuck on the ground!

01:17:56.462 --> 01:17:58.157
I'm fucking serious!

01:17:59.865 --> 01:18:00.889
I'm bleeding.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.400
No, no! Dude, we're filming.

01:18:03.602 --> 01:18:05.968
- Fuck you! Get the fuck out of here!
- No, we're fucking filming!

01:18:06.071 --> 01:18:08.767
That's Bam Margera, dumbshit!
He's famous!

01:18:08.874 --> 01:18:11.240
Look, there's cameras,
there's a sound guy.

01:18:11.343 --> 01:18:12.537
We're filming a fucking movie, dude.

01:18:12.645 --> 01:18:15.079
This guy's got a dynamite vest on!

01:18:16.815 --> 01:18:18.612
Hey, put the gun down, dude!

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:23.579
What the fuck?

01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:25.350
He shot me!

01:18:25.457 --> 01:18:28.153
Preston, you fucking idiot!
Get me the fuck out of here!

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:29.693
- Fuck this!
- Please, sir! Please, sir!

01:18:29.795 --> 01:18:31.194
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Sir, please!

01:18:31.964 --> 01:18:33.329
- Please! Stop!
- Sir, please!

01:18:33.599 --> 01:18:35.066
What the fuck?

01:18:35.901 --> 01:18:37.869
Dude, get me out of here!

01:18:38.037 --> 01:18:39.368
Oh, shit!

01:18:39.838 --> 01:18:41.100
Oh, shit!

01:18:41.473 --> 01:18:42.997
Oh, God, no!

01:18:43.409 --> 01:18:45.343
Oh, fuck. I'm going to fucking die.

01:18:45.444 --> 01:18:49.847
Why the fuck did I agree to do this shit?
Dude, it wasn't even my fucking idea.

01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:02.158
Fucking fuck.

01:19:07.199 --> 01:19:09.190
Oh, my God, dude.

01:19:09.301 --> 01:19:10.632
I can't believe that shit, dude.

01:19:10.736 --> 01:19:13.398
What the fuck, are you an actor
or some bullshit?

01:19:13.505 --> 01:19:15.700
- Come on.
- Fucking crap, dude!

01:19:15.808 --> 01:19:18.709
I almost shit my pants.
I'm not even kidding.

01:19:18.811 --> 01:19:20.745
Dude, that was so awesome.

01:19:21.013 --> 01:19:23.777
Oh, God, dude, I'm so happy
right now. Seriously.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.684
Oh, my God. I was so worried.

01:19:26.819 --> 01:19:27.786
Fuck.

01:19:28.053 --> 01:19:30.715
I get it. It's a prank on a prank, yeah.

01:19:30.823 --> 01:19:32.916
He fucking pulled out
a gun on me, dude.

01:19:33.025 --> 01:19:35.220
Look where your beard came from.

01:19:36.495 --> 01:19:38.395
Look, look! I'll show you!

01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:40.589
Look at my patch!

01:19:42.434 --> 01:19:44.561
Look! That's all our pubes.

01:19:45.738 --> 01:19:48.002
You should try and get that off.

01:19:48.641 --> 01:19:50.734
Oh, my God, dude, that sucks.

01:19:50.843 --> 01:19:53.676
Every time it gets
fucking worse and worse.

01:19:54.780 --> 01:19:57.442
You guys didn't fucking superglue that,
did you?

01:19:57.549 --> 01:19:58.573
No!

01:19:59.018 --> 01:20:02.010
That sucks! I told you not to do that!

01:20:02.121 --> 01:20:05.022
Ehren, come on!
Why are you getting mad at me?

01:20:05.357 --> 01:20:08.224
I got your dick hair all over
my fucking face!

01:20:08.327 --> 01:20:11.819
This sucks, dude!
Give me something to get this shit off.

01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:13.623
This shit was in my mouth!

01:20:13.732 --> 01:20:15.632
How are you going to explain
crabs on your face?

01:20:15.734 --> 01:20:17.759
This shit was all over my fucking mouth!

01:20:17.870 --> 01:20:19.895
It wasn't from my dick.
Some of it was from my ass.

01:20:23.309 --> 01:20:25.277
Oh, God, this is so bad.

01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:27.607
Look at this. This is from Derek.

01:20:28.247 --> 01:20:30.841
"Okay, who brought crabs to the party?
Fuck me."

01:20:33.419 --> 01:20:35.353
One of the guys had crabs!

01:20:41.093 --> 01:20:45.029
Seriously, like,
was the dick hair necessary?

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:46.461
Absolutely.

01:20:46.699 --> 01:20:48.724
Like, was that the big payoff?

01:20:48.834 --> 01:20:52.600
Like, "Ha, ha,
dick hairs glued on his face"?

01:20:53.439 --> 01:20:55.839
- Is it itching?
- It's in my mouth.

01:20:55.941 --> 01:20:58.034
Why'd you put it in your mouth?

01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:03.069
I'm Johnny Knoxville
and this is the Bear Trap.

01:21:04.316 --> 01:21:07.285
<i>The best of times is now</i>

01:21:07.386 --> 01:21:11.652

Get it off! Get it off!

01:21:40.819 --> 01:21:46.689

01:23:54.853 --> 01:23:57.947
I'll <i>Jackass Two</i> your ass.
Do me a favor.

01:23:58.056 --> 01:24:00.991
And you wonder why I drink?
I drink to steady my nerves.

01:24:01.093 --> 01:24:03.561
I was so steady,
I couldn't move last week!

01:24:03.729 --> 01:24:06.562
I had vodka and prune juice.
It's called a piledriver.

01:24:06.665 --> 01:24:08.098
I'll be okay.

01:24:33.825 --> 01:24:37.261
Please, God, don't let there
be a <i>Jackass Three.</i>

01:24:37.829 --> 01:24:40.992
Please, please, God, don't let there
be a <i>Jackass Three.</i>

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.227
I don't even like doing <i>Two.</i>

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:46.169
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville.

01:24:46.271 --> 01:24:47.932
Welcome to India!

01:24:51.009 --> 01:24:51.976
Can I get off his dick...

01:25:30.749 --> 01:25:32.046
Way to go.

01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:19.097
I don't like this at all!

01:26:26.638 --> 01:26:29.436
Sorry, bro. I didn't see you there.

01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:31.441
I was headed over to Produce.

01:26:31.977 --> 01:26:34.343
You knocked out my tooth again!

01:26:34.446 --> 01:26:35.913
Look at Rick!

01:26:37.015 --> 01:26:39.040
He fucking swallowed it?

01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:45.486
Horse cum!

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:50.253
I'm not getting paid to be on camera,
you fucking dick.

01:27:00.539 --> 01:27:01.631
That was great.

01:27:02.174 --> 01:27:03.801
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:04.376 --> 01:27:06.241
Yeah, what have you got?

01:27:41.847 --> 01:27:42.905
Marker.

01:27:44.382 --> 01:27:46.145
Don't drop your shit.

01:27:54.092 --> 01:27:56.219
Just act like it hurts, okay?

01:27:59.431 --> 01:28:02.992
Wow. I actually feel energized after that.

01:28:05.003 --> 01:28:06.834
Oh my God, look!
Point it at the cameraman!

01:28:08.073 --> 01:28:09.665
Into the sink!

01:28:09.775 --> 01:28:11.003
In the sink!

01:28:11.343 --> 01:28:13.368
- In the sink!
- In the sink!

01:28:23.155 --> 01:28:24.622
- Are you lubed up?
- Yeah!

01:28:24.723 --> 01:28:27.886
Hey, they're ready to go.
Do you want to shoot it?

01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:40.231
You all right, buddy?

01:28:41.273 --> 01:28:42.968
I'm all right, man.

01:28:48.246 --> 01:28:51.340
Water-based lubricants. Friend or foe?

01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:52.848
You be the judge.

01:29:10.836 --> 01:29:11.996
Okay, I can't breathe.

01:29:27.419 --> 01:29:29.717
Can you take it off, please?

01:29:43.802 --> 01:29:46.100
- Oh, is this your fruit?
- No.

01:29:46.504 --> 01:29:49.871
Oh, these are beautiful!
They're so round and lush.

01:29:50.976 --> 01:29:53.911
- How much is the oranges?
- $6.

01:29:54.012 --> 01:29:55.036
Okay.

01:30:02.454 --> 01:30:05.719
I accidentally cut myself.
I need a doctor, dude.

01:30:05.857 --> 01:30:06.949
Doctor!

01:30:08.493 --> 01:30:10.256
- We're supposed to catch these?
- Yeah!

01:30:10.362 --> 01:30:11.852
You are fucking kidding!

01:30:11.963 --> 01:30:13.260
Oh, my God!

01:30:46.498 --> 01:30:47.760
Don't do that.

01:30:47.866 --> 01:30:49.197
The snake is attracted to the heat.

01:30:49.301 --> 01:30:52.395
Yeah, we got to get the mousey warm
for the snake.

01:30:52.971 --> 01:30:54.199
But not too warm!

01:30:54.306 --> 01:30:57.070
- Look at his face.
- He has a big raspberry.

01:30:57.509 --> 01:30:59.101
A couple of them.

01:31:43.755 --> 01:31:44.722
Shit!

01:31:46.758 --> 01:31:48.589
What the fuck happened?

01:31:49.427 --> 01:31:50.826
- Medic!
- Medic!

01:31:52.664 --> 01:31:53.926
Someone said cut.

01:31:59.137 --> 01:32:00.399
What's up, Bam?

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:04.770
I hate the fact that I had to fucking

01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:08.511
hang out with alligators
and fucking cobras.

01:32:10.215 --> 01:32:12.513
I have dicks branded on my ass...

01:32:14.352 --> 01:32:16.320
Everything fucking sucks.

01:32:22.794 --> 01:32:26.753
Like, everybody's
just f-ing with me today.

01:32:28.933 --> 01:32:30.696
And my Misfits sock.

01:32:33.938 --> 01:32:35.997
It's not even funny anymore.

01:32:36.174 --> 01:32:37.641
I want to go home.
