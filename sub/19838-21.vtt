00:01.750 --> 00:04.100
<b><i>Been a while since I flipped my switch on.</i></b>

00:10.320 --> 00:12.690
<b><i>Scissors!</i></b>

00:22.540 --> 00:24.000
<b>Well?</b>

00:24.400 --> 00:25.730
<b>Look at this!</b>

00:27.560 --> 00:30.260
<b>I feel reborn!</b>

01:51.000 --> 01:56.010
<b>Inspiration x To x Evolve</b>

02:00.370 --> 02:02.290
<b>The Hunters Association</b>

02:02.290 --> 02:07.150
<b>has learned of the Chimera Ants 
from the biological survey team,</b>

02:07.150 --> 02:09.990
<b>and now awaits the world leaders' 
decision on how to handle them.</b>

02:17.530 --> 02:19.200
<b>We're counting on you.</b>

02:19.480 --> 02:22.090
<b>You have a single mission.</b>

02:22.810 --> 02:26.080
<b>The immediate extermination 
of these dangerous creatures.</b>

02:28.170 --> 02:31.050
<b>There have already been many casualties.</b>

02:31.660 --> 02:33.440
<b>We will use any means necessary.</b>

02:34.210 --> 02:36.590
<b>Will that be acceptable?</b>

02:37.470 --> 02:42.170
<b>Naturally, we have no intention of 
telling the experts how to proceed.</b>

02:44.510 --> 02:46.140
<b>We simply desire</b>

02:46.140 --> 02:50.940
<b>those dangerous creatures 
eradicated as swiftly as possible.</b>

02:52.390 --> 02:53.810
<b>Understood.</b>

02:55.810 --> 03:01.570
<b><i>So their goal is to eradicate the Ants, 
leaving the Hunters Association</i></b>

03:01.570 --> 03:03.780
<b><i>to take the blame.</i></b>

03:08.900 --> 03:10.580
<b>Th-The Chimera Ants</b>

03:11.000 --> 03:15.590
<b>have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.</b>

03:23.340 --> 03:25.390
<b>Queen</b>

03:23.830 --> 03:25.320
<b>There's the Queen.</b>

03:25.510 --> 03:28.140
<b>Royal Guard</b>

03:25.960 --> 03:28.160
<b>Under her is the Royal Guard,</b>

03:28.270 --> 03:31.100
<b>Squadron Leaders</b>

03:28.800 --> 03:31.100
<b>and then, the Squadron Leaders.</b>

03:31.730 --> 03:34.100
<b>Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,</b>

03:34.600 --> 03:38.860
<b>and they oversee many foot 
soldiers and other grunts.</b>

03:39.470 --> 03:44.870
<b>A-And once the King is born, 
the hierarchy shifts like so.</b>

03:47.720 --> 03:50.350
<b>The Royal Guard that followed the Queen</b>

03:50.350 --> 03:53.120
<b>switches into the King's service.</b>

03:53.820 --> 03:58.030
<b>A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders 
report directly to the Queen,</b>

03:59.180 --> 04:02.260
<b>and she focuses on directing the soldiers.</b>

04:02.810 --> 04:07.310
<b>The Queen remains in the castle, 
periodically giving birth to Kings.</b>

04:10.440 --> 04:13.770
<b>The Kings travel and mate 
with different organisms,</b>

04:14.220 --> 04:17.400
<b>so as to breed new Queens.</b>

04:21.140 --> 04:23.270
<b>That explains their fast reproduction rate.</b>

04:23.860 --> 04:26.280
<b>To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,</b>

04:26.280 --> 04:29.790
<b>you must defeat the Queen before 
she can give birth to a King.</b>

04:30.370 --> 04:35.420
<b>But first, you need to defeat 
all the soldiers guarding her.</b>

04:36.580 --> 04:38.310
<b>That's a tall order.</b>

04:52.830 --> 04:54.690
<b>Got it. We'll be waiting.</b>

04:55.940 --> 04:57.940
<b>The punitive force's first wave is on its way.</b>

04:58.430 --> 04:59.550
<b>Punitive force?</b>

05:00.500 --> 05:01.820
<b>I wonder who they'll send.</b>

05:02.490 --> 05:05.200
<b>They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.</b>

05:05.800 --> 05:07.700
<b>They'll be strong.</b>

05:08.050 --> 05:09.500
<b>They'd better be!</b>

05:09.500 --> 05:11.330
<b>I'm worried about Kite and the kids.</b>

05:12.820 --> 05:14.410
<b>They'll arrive in three days.</b>

05:28.940 --> 05:29.850
<b><i>How?</i></b>

05:30.590 --> 05:32.090
<b>Look at this!</b>

05:32.090 --> 05:34.350
<b>Isn't it incredible?</b>

05:34.960 --> 05:37.350
<b><i>Why does Rammot have so much life energy?</i></b>

05:38.240 --> 05:40.020
<b><i>There must have been some catalyst.</i></b>

05:42.080 --> 05:43.110
<b><i>A catalyst...</i></b>

05:47.270 --> 05:48.200
<b><i>Rock...</i></b>

05:48.660 --> 05:49.700
<b><i>Paper...</i></b>

05:50.070 --> 05:52.410
<b><i>Rock!</i></b>

05:55.080 --> 05:56.900
<b><i>That hurts...</i></b>

05:56.900 --> 05:59.250
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

05:59.840 --> 06:03.630
<b><i>What if their attacks were the catalyst?</i></b>

06:06.900 --> 06:11.390
<b>I can feel the power filling me!</b>

06:11.790 --> 06:12.590
<b>Peggy...</b>

06:13.890 --> 06:18.020
<b>I told you that we are capable 
of anything that humans are.</b>

06:18.600 --> 06:20.870
<b>Including the use of this strange power?</b>

06:20.870 --> 06:22.830
<b>But this is...</b>

06:26.870 --> 06:29.660
<b>Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.</b>

06:30.110 --> 06:31.910
<b>Wh-What are you saying?</b>

06:35.160 --> 06:39.920
<b>You've been ticking me off, 
so I won't go easy on you.</b>

06:40.370 --> 06:42.670
<b>I'm assuming that's what it takes.</b>

06:46.770 --> 06:49.440
<b>Then I won't hold back.</b>

06:49.820 --> 06:50.700
<b>Come.</b>

07:06.190 --> 07:08.240
<b>Colt!</b>

07:10.520 --> 07:12.930
<b>This is a message from Hagya.</b>

07:18.380 --> 07:21.110
<b>This is a message from Hagya.</b>

07:22.990 --> 07:27.760
<b>The ultimate prey is either 
within the factory or nearby.</b>

07:34.100 --> 07:35.460
<b>Capture it.</b>

07:37.800 --> 07:39.350
<b>Capture it...</b>

07:41.270 --> 07:43.270
<b>Dead or alive.</b>

07:45.300 --> 07:47.080
<b>Capture it!</b>

07:53.340 --> 07:54.460
<b>Hagya-sama...</b>

07:54.460 --> 07:55.420
<b>What is it?</b>

07:55.420 --> 07:57.420
<b>Do you believe they will succeed?</b>

07:57.420 --> 08:01.990
<b>There are enough Captains for a decent fight.</b>

08:01.990 --> 08:05.290
<b>For a decent fight, huh?</b>

08:05.690 --> 08:08.930
<b>But I doubt they'll be much help.</b>

08:09.480 --> 08:11.300
<b>I'm fine with that.</b>

08:11.300 --> 08:12.800
<b>Why is that?</b>

08:13.400 --> 08:16.550
<b>They're just buying time for us to arrive.</b>

08:16.940 --> 08:19.680
<b>Oh, I see.</b>

08:20.070 --> 08:23.690
<b>Then the rare humans will be ours to take.</b>

08:24.890 --> 08:26.710
<b>Exactly.</b>

08:56.680 --> 08:57.850
<b>We're surrounded.</b>

09:00.640 --> 09:02.100
<b>Their numbers are great.</b>

09:32.330 --> 09:34.010
<b>Now, then...</b>

09:34.690 --> 09:37.710
<b>Let's decide order and methodology.</b>

09:38.530 --> 09:44.140
<b>As for our targets, you have three choices.</b>

09:44.640 --> 09:46.350
<b>One...</b>

09:46.350 --> 09:49.100
<b>Decide the order in which you will fight.</b>

09:49.440 --> 09:52.480
<b>Two, attempt to escape.</b>

09:52.770 --> 09:56.400
<b>Three, give up and let us capture you.</b>

09:56.860 --> 09:58.570
<b>If you choose option one,</b>

09:58.570 --> 10:02.390
<b>you will fight one-on-one battles with us</b>

10:02.390 --> 10:04.910
<b>for a chance to survive.</b>

10:05.270 --> 10:07.650
<b>I don't recommend the second option.</b>

10:07.650 --> 10:12.920
<b>You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture</b>

10:12.920 --> 10:15.090
<b>and prolonged suffering for all of you.</b>

10:15.920 --> 10:19.260
<b>Option three is out of the question.</b>

10:19.260 --> 10:23.680
<b>That would anger us even more than option two.</b>

10:26.850 --> 10:29.740
<b>So, what will you do?</b>

10:30.500 --> 10:31.550
<b>Kite...</b>

10:33.100 --> 10:34.940
<b>We couldn't have asked for a better deal.</b>

10:37.390 --> 10:39.270
<b>One-on-one fights with their Captains.</b>

10:39.730 --> 10:42.490
<b>We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.</b>

10:42.810 --> 10:43.650
<b>I'll go.</b>

10:43.650 --> 10:45.240
<b>No, I will.</b>

10:49.020 --> 10:50.280
<b>First comes rock!</b>

10:50.280 --> 10:51.500
<b>Rock, paper, scissors!</b>

10:59.840 --> 11:02.270
<b>Okay, I'm first!</b>

11:13.330 --> 11:16.850
<b><i>While the Ants have inherited 
individualism from humans,</i></b>

11:17.370 --> 11:20.280
<b><i>they've lost the unity that's 
characteristic of ants.</i></b>

11:21.160 --> 11:22.930
<b><i>I hope we'll be able</i></b>

11:22.930 --> 11:25.390
<b><i>to take advantage of that change.</i></b>

11:26.130 --> 11:29.370
<b>Well, we need to decide who 
to send from our side.</b>

11:32.560 --> 11:33.540
<b>#6...</b>

11:33.540 --> 11:34.570
<b>#6!</b>

11:34.940 --> 11:35.790
<b>Who's #6?</b>

11:40.120 --> 11:41.800
<b>Lucky me!</b>

11:42.870 --> 11:44.050
<b>Baro?</b>

11:44.480 --> 11:46.420
<b>How will the victor be decided?</b>

11:46.420 --> 11:48.810
<b>Eh? That should be obvious.</b>

11:49.750 --> 11:52.060
<b>Whoever dies first loses.</b>

11:52.510 --> 11:54.610
<b>We can't just surrender?</b>

11:55.100 --> 11:55.800
<b>What?!</b>

11:59.400 --> 12:00.940
<b>Are you crazy?</b>

12:00.940 --> 12:04.110
<b>If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.</b>

12:04.110 --> 12:08.700
<b>If you don't defeat me, 
you're guaranteed to die!</b>

12:08.970 --> 12:11.330
<b>Yeah, I'm okay with that.</b>

12:11.330 --> 12:14.750
<b>But there's no need for you to die.</b>

12:15.060 --> 12:17.660
<b>If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.</b>

12:19.030 --> 12:22.010
<b>If you surrender, you'll live.</b>

12:22.010 --> 12:23.340
<b>But if you lose,</b>

12:23.340 --> 12:28.350
<b>you must promise never to eat another human.</b>

12:30.890 --> 12:33.030
<b>This guy isn't taking us seriously!</b>

12:33.030 --> 12:36.410
<b>He has more pep than any human I've seen!</b>

12:36.410 --> 12:38.360
<b>Lucky you, Baro-chan!</b>

12:38.700 --> 12:40.470
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

12:50.000 --> 12:51.450
<b>You managed to dodge that one.</b>

12:53.460 --> 12:56.880
<b>Then how about this?</b>

12:58.260 --> 12:59.710
<b><i>The same attack?</i></b>

13:10.930 --> 13:11.770
<b>Gon!</b>

13:12.610 --> 13:14.120
<b><i>He altered course.</i></b>

13:18.280 --> 13:19.520
<b>I'm fine.</b>

13:20.910 --> 13:23.170
<b>Why are you so tough?</b>

13:23.170 --> 13:26.530
<b>By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.</b>

13:29.870 --> 13:31.190
<b>Whatever...</b>

13:31.190 --> 13:33.230
<b>Just need a few more times.</b>

13:33.230 --> 13:36.540
<b>There's no way to dodge my homing roll!</b>

13:39.600 --> 13:40.890
<b><i>Indeed...</i></b>

13:40.890 --> 13:45.420
<b><i>He only has to alter his course to 
match the direction Gon dodges.</i></b>

13:47.940 --> 13:49.910
<b><i>What will you do, Gon?</i></b>

13:51.400 --> 13:54.610
<b>Kid, I have something to 
tell you before I kill you.</b>

13:54.610 --> 13:58.040
<b>The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them</b>

13:58.040 --> 14:00.560
<b>or to feed them to the Queen.</b>

14:00.910 --> 14:02.350
<b>Then why?</b>

14:03.080 --> 14:04.940
<b>Because it's fun!</b>

14:07.200 --> 14:11.950
<b>I love the sound as humans 
vomit their own organs</b>

14:11.950 --> 14:13.630
<b>with a plop!</b>

14:14.020 --> 14:16.960
<b>It's hilarious because it looks like barf.</b>

14:17.260 --> 14:19.010
<b>That isn't funny.</b>

14:21.030 --> 14:25.460
<b>I'll make you vomit your own 
organs with a plop, too!</b>

14:49.970 --> 14:51.230
<b>He didn't dodge...</b>

14:52.070 --> 14:53.330
<b>But stopped him.</b>

14:58.580 --> 15:00.740
<b>Compared to Razor's spikes,</b>

15:01.830 --> 15:05.160
<b>this is nothing!</b>

15:24.640 --> 15:27.650
<b>Well, we're in a hurry.</b>

15:29.460 --> 15:30.780
<b>Who's my opponent?</b>

15:31.880 --> 15:32.940
<b>Hey!</b>

15:36.050 --> 15:36.840
<b>#3.</b>

15:37.840 --> 15:38.970
<b>#3's up!</b>

15:42.080 --> 15:44.540
<b>You won't be smiling for long.</b>

15:45.010 --> 15:47.290
<b>I'm about to show you hell.</b>

15:48.090 --> 15:49.120
<b>Got it?</b>

15:49.120 --> 15:51.430
<b>I'm nothing like the trash over there.</b>

15:51.430 --> 15:52.440
<b>Trash?</b>

15:52.970 --> 15:55.930
<b>Huh? I said trash because he's trash.</b>

15:58.980 --> 16:01.560
<b>I'm ten times stronger than that guy.</b>

16:01.870 --> 16:04.060
<b>Oh, that's nothing to brag about.</b>

16:04.440 --> 16:06.360
<b>What was that?!</b>

16:07.190 --> 16:12.320
<b><i>When they enter battle, 
their aura becomes much stronger.</i></b>

16:12.840 --> 16:14.420
<b><i>They're at their best in battle.</i></b>

16:16.850 --> 16:20.080
<b><i>Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,</i></b>

16:21.600 --> 16:23.570
<b><i>but we should have time.</i></b>

16:24.040 --> 16:27.420
<b><i>We'll reach the Queen before 
she gives birth to the King.</i></b>

16:28.890 --> 16:30.300
<b><i>But why</i></b>

16:31.780 --> 16:33.380
<b><i>do I have such a bad feeling?</i></b>

16:35.310 --> 16:37.220
<b><i>I feel like I'm missing something.</i></b>

16:42.760 --> 16:45.710
<b><i>There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.</i></b>

16:50.290 --> 16:52.240
<b>Look, Peggy!</b>

16:57.390 --> 17:02.250
<b>I can freely control this energy!</b>

17:02.460 --> 17:05.420
<b>This is incredible!</b>

17:08.080 --> 17:10.000
<b>We should do more research.</b>

17:10.520 --> 17:11.380
<b>Eh?</b>

17:11.700 --> 17:14.810
<b>If we learn the proper way 
to wield this power,</b>

17:14.810 --> 17:17.450
<b>we can synchronize it with our natural abilities</b>

17:17.450 --> 17:19.890
<b>to make it an even stronger weapon.</b>

17:21.120 --> 17:24.080
<b>You're too retentive...</b>

17:24.420 --> 17:25.440
<b>Zazan...</b>

17:28.100 --> 17:32.650
<b>She said she captured a rare 
human a few days ago...</b>

17:36.070 --> 17:37.910
<b>If we're lucky,</b>

17:38.800 --> 17:40.510
<b>he's still in the storeroom.</b>

17:43.070 --> 17:45.110
<b>Find and secure him.</b>

18:10.550 --> 18:14.190
<b>My entire body is covered by hardened skin.</b>

18:17.170 --> 18:21.240
<b>I can take as many of those 
attacks as you can throw!</b>

18:21.240 --> 18:22.530
<b>Oh, yeah?</b>

18:49.300 --> 18:51.970
<b>Is there anyone ten times 
stronger than this guy?</b>

18:52.880 --> 18:54.570
<b><i>This is a pleasant surprise.</i></b>

18:55.330 --> 18:57.770
<b><i>Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.</i></b>

18:58.410 --> 19:02.910
<b><i>Am I worried over nothing?</i></b>

19:04.380 --> 19:06.730
<b>That's enough... It's my turn!</b>

19:08.520 --> 19:09.550
<b>2!</b>

19:12.530 --> 19:13.450
<b>What?</b>

19:21.490 --> 19:22.470
<b>Two, huh?</b>

19:23.200 --> 19:24.300
<b>Damn, bad spin.</b>

19:24.610 --> 19:25.530
<b>Killua...</b>

19:27.200 --> 19:29.740
<b>That scythe is nasty.</b>

19:30.960 --> 19:32.310
<b>Gon, Killua...</b>

19:33.310 --> 19:35.190
<b>In three seconds, jump up.</b>

19:40.240 --> 19:43.950
<b><i>Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?</i></b>

19:50.600 --> 19:51.650
<b><i>Right!</i></b>

19:51.650 --> 19:55.960
<b><i>I've experienced this sensation before!</i></b>

20:00.860 --> 20:03.010
<b>Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance</b>

20:20.720 --> 20:22.490
<b>I remember now.</b>

20:26.740 --> 20:27.930
<b>This is</b>

20:29.340 --> 20:30.310
<b>death!</b>

20:31.780 --> 20:34.410
<b>Murder via overwhelming force.</b>

20:45.680 --> 20:46.640
<b>Get lost.</b>

20:48.890 --> 20:52.030
<b>This scythe can be used 
only with this technique.</b>

20:52.030 --> 20:55.350
<b>And it won't disappear until I've used it.</b>

20:58.930 --> 21:01.200
<b>It's such a drag...</b>

21:01.200 --> 21:03.780
<b><i>So why did you choose that power?</i></b>

21:05.600 --> 21:07.210
<b>Be cautious as we advance.</b>

21:07.900 --> 21:11.540
<b>As I mentioned, that won't be 
enough to kill them immediately.</b>

21:14.200 --> 21:15.290
<b>Are you okay?</b>

21:16.910 --> 21:19.450
<b>It's only getting worse from here.</b>

21:19.850 --> 21:24.300
<b>If you start to sympathize with the enemy, 
you won't be able to handle what's coming.</b>

21:25.410 --> 21:26.430
<b>I'm fine.</b>

21:26.430 --> 21:30.060
<b>I have no sympathy for bugs 
that call each other trash.</b>

21:31.490 --> 21:33.360
<b><i>That's a dangerous view.</i></b>

21:36.010 --> 21:40.000
<b><i>What would you do if one of those 
bugs cared for its comrades?</i></b>

21:43.410 --> 21:49.670
<b>Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward 
the Chimera Ant Queen's castle</b>

21:49.670 --> 21:52.840
<b>to prevent the King's birth.</b>

23:26.340 --> 23:28.650
<b>Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.</b>

23:28.650 --> 23:29.250
<b>I'll go.</b>

23:29.250 --> 23:30.170
<b>No, I will!</b>

23:30.170 --> 23:31.070
<b>No, me!</b>

23:31.070 --> 23:32.400
<b>Then I'll go.</b>

23:32.400 --> 23:34.260
<b>Go right ahead.</b>
