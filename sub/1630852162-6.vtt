WEBVTT

01:18.620 --> 01:21.706
At what point do we worry
that no one else is back yet?

01:21.790 --> 01:25.043
We got swallowed by a giant assmouth.
Who knows what they had to deal with?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.047
What was that?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.364
Oh!

01:57.325 --> 01:59.285
Oh, thank God!

01:59.786 --> 02:01.871
Sorry, the door was jammed shut.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.500
-So the, uh, the robot had to, uh--
-No, I'm just glad it's you.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.001
Oh!

02:07.919 --> 02:09.963
What happened here?

02:10.839 --> 02:13.049
Looks like everything is covered in snot.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.801
No, it's saliva. Maybe bile.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.595
We were swallowed
by a subterranean alien organism.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.806
-Oh.
-Okay, how long until we launch?

02:19.889 --> 02:23.518
Uh, we have a few more repairs to make
before we're flight-worthy.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.396
How long until the four-armed nightmare
machines figure out where we are?

02:26.479 --> 02:29.649
Well, the longer we're ghosts,
the better our odds, so we run cold.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.318
No power. The first time those robots
know where we are

02:32.402 --> 02:34.571
better be the moment
we punch a hole in the sky.

02:34.654 --> 02:38.867
Okay. Everyone, flight assignments,
for hopefully the last time. Penny--

02:38.950 --> 02:39.784
I know, I know.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.120
You replace the OGS filters,
which are probably clogged

02:42.203 --> 02:44.038
-with something disgusting.
-And toxic.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.416
Don't touch it with your hands.
I have gloves for us.

02:46.499 --> 02:50.587
Us? You mean I don't have to do the most
disgusting job on the ship by myself?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.839
Well, no. Robinsons stick together.

02:52.922 --> 02:53.756
Hmm!

02:54.507 --> 02:55.425
Do they?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.220
Smith, I need help in the garage.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.639
We need to restore airflow
to the ventilation system

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
if you wanna breathe
when we get back into space.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.518
Happy to help. I love breathing.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.063
Robot. I need you
to seal the hub roof panels.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.106
Can you do that?

03:11.357 --> 03:15.195
Hey, Will, let's get up top.
See if we can get eyes on Don.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.199
Hey!

03:21.159 --> 03:22.327
We're gonna make it.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.079
Together.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.541
Yeah… together.

03:41.429 --> 03:43.806
We need to swap out
the rest of the coils.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.351
Make sure there's no residue
on the burners. Pliers.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.854
Judy told me what you did.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.234
How you saved her life.
Kept your nose clean.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.404
Became a teacher.
I had no idea you spoke French.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.032
A little bit.

04:02.367 --> 04:06.037
My kids, well, all our kids,
survived a year on their own,

04:06.120 --> 04:10.041
and you were a part of that,
so I guess I should be grateful.

04:12.126 --> 04:15.171
They took care of me too.
We took care of each other.

04:15.922 --> 04:16.881
Um…

04:16.965 --> 04:21.719
I feel like I missed so much during
that year that we were apart, and I--

04:22.220 --> 04:25.139
I mean, I know that they wouldn't tell us
everything anyway,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.684
but I-- I thought maybe, um…

04:29.310 --> 04:30.478
Maybe what?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.063
Well, maybe you'd know.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.399
If there were any developments

04:34.482 --> 04:38.319
or… or firsts
that a… a mother should know about.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.572
Penny's first love triangle.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.908
Don't worry. It was tame.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.036
Vijay and this tall kid, Liam.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.499
Nice guy. Kind of a show-off.
A bit obvious if you ask me.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.626
Judy must have had
some opinions about that.

04:53.710 --> 04:57.213
From what I could tell, Judy was focused
on trying to be a good captain.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.134
And discovering that only by stepping out
of the shadow of her parents

05:01.217 --> 05:04.929
was there room enough for her
to fulfill her own true potential.

05:06.848 --> 05:10.059
Ah, but you're more curious about
how she was with Grant Kelly.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.730
Did they, uh… get along?

05:14.397 --> 05:17.650
What were you hoping for, Maureen?
That they did or didn't?

05:18.860 --> 05:21.321
I-- That has nothing to do with it.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.615
Okay, then. Well, yes, they got along.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.411
And what about Will?

05:28.494 --> 05:31.581
He seems, I don't know,
kind of more serious.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.752
He has a lot on his mind.

05:38.921 --> 05:39.756
Like what?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.218
Like…

05:46.346 --> 05:47.764
learning how to control his body.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.891
You've seen him.
He's all arms and legs now.

05:55.063 --> 05:55.980
All right.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.027
Okay. I think that's it.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.699
Thank you for your help.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.494
All I did was hand you the tools.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.622
Come on.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.540
There's more to do.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.924
Hey, is that a new haircut?
I like it.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.926
Thanks. Judy did it.

06:25.510 --> 06:30.181
Yeah? And, uh, did I see
something on your chin? A shadow?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.350
-You started shaving?

06:33.226 --> 06:38.231
There was one hair,
yeah, but it got long. Like, really long.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.692
Penny gave it a name
before she plucked it.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.820
-What did she call it?
-Carl.

06:46.072 --> 06:46.989
Hey, Will.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.243
Listen, uh…

06:52.120 --> 06:53.496
when we first got lost,

06:54.664 --> 06:57.917
I made you a promise that I would
never split the family up again.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.837
And a year ago,
that's exactly what happened.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.506
-You didn't have a choice.
-I know, I know. But I…

07:04.757 --> 07:06.759
missed a lot, again.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.429
Hell, I never even got to meet Carl.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.767
So, when we finally get to Alpha Centauri,

07:14.851 --> 07:15.935
I promise you,

07:17.353 --> 07:20.148
we're gonna do
some regular father-son things.

07:20.731 --> 07:25.528
No more running for our lives
or fighting alien robots.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.948
Yeah. That'd be nice.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.540
Just do normal, everyday things

07:37.623 --> 07:41.252
like embarrassing you
in front of your friends, hmm?

07:41.752 --> 07:44.464
Or giving you
an unreasonably early curfew.

07:44.547 --> 07:48.301
Or how about docking my allowance
whenever I forget to do my chores?

07:49.135 --> 07:49.969
Really?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.472
Kid saves us a couple of times,

07:52.555 --> 07:56.392
and, uh… suddenly he thinks
he deserves an allowance?

07:56.476 --> 07:59.103
How else am I gonna support
my huge gambling problem?

07:59.187 --> 08:02.315
Hey, gambling is only a problem
if you lose.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.026
I'll teach you a few things. Hmm?

08:05.902 --> 08:08.613
See? This is why
you need your old man around.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.700
How about we start with something small,

08:13.451 --> 08:16.204
like… teaching me how to use a razor?

08:19.707 --> 08:20.708
I'd like that.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.336
Me too.

08:28.382 --> 08:33.012
Now, if I was Don West, where would I be?

08:34.680 --> 08:35.681
Aah.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.729
-Got him.
-Yeah?

08:43.147 --> 08:44.273
900 meters out.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.362
-Any sign of SAR and his friends?

08:50.154 --> 08:54.575
Not yet, but it's only a matter of time
before they figure out where we are.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.228
Hey, I need to talk with you for a second.

09:23.813 --> 09:28.776
Look, I've been thinking,
and if we can get out of here safely,

09:29.277 --> 09:32.822
there's really no reason I can think of
why we have to fight SAR today

09:34.323 --> 09:35.366
or even tomorrow.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.538
Look, my family has to get
to Alpha Centauri.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.916
That's more important to me
than anything right now.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.128
Help family.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.214
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Help them get there.

09:50.298 --> 09:54.844
And then, if we have to, later on,
we can come up with a new plan.

09:56.012 --> 09:56.929
Okay?

10:04.687 --> 10:05.646
Good.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.399
Yeah, good.

10:17.658 --> 10:18.534
Hey.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.119
Hi.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.665
Uh, anything I can do
to help move things a little faster?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.334
It's a one-person job,

10:26.417 --> 10:29.420
and I can only go as fast
as this thing can process the data.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.180
Together again.

10:40.014 --> 10:40.931
All of us.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.394
It's been a while
since we've been parents.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.357
I don't think
you ever stop being a parent.

10:50.566 --> 10:53.527
We were just… unemployed for a year.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.573
It's a good job.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.950
Yeah, it is.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.754
-Oh.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.632
Last one.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.557
Two more minutes.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.687
While that's processing, I want you
to take a look at something Penny found.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.856
I pulled all the hard drives
from the Fortuna.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.402
And strange thing is,

11:35.319 --> 11:36.904
they were all scrubbed.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
-That's odd.
-Yeah.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.202
All nav data, flight reports…

11:43.285 --> 11:46.747
The only proof of life was the CC cams.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.674
-Is that--
-Grant Kelly. Yeah.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.768
He doesn't try to hurt him.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.814
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.567
Some kind of scan or… reading.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.402
Checking for vitals.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.071
-When was this recorded?
-Uh…

12:19.613 --> 12:23.409
Time stamp's kinda hard to…
What is that, a 12?

12:23.951 --> 12:27.580
12… 12.21.44.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.415
-12.21.44.
-Yeah.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.960
What is that? That's five…
five and a half years ago.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.045
Anyone have an extra left boot?

12:35.129 --> 12:36.464
-Anyone?

12:36.547 --> 12:39.216
I'll take a sneaker,
but I'd prefer a boot for symmetry.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.093
Is that Don? Don?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.636
-Hey!
-Hey!

12:42.720 --> 12:43.929
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, Don!

12:44.013 --> 12:46.474
-Hey, Penny.
-Oh! Sweaty. It's okay, actually.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.933
-Hey, Debbie!
-Hi!

12:48.017 --> 12:49.894
We've been through
a lot.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.938
Be careful how tight
you hold that bird, Don.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.274
-You don't wanna choke your chicken.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.152
Relax, she's makin' a joke.
We don't listen to the crazy lady.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.278
Go wash up, okay?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.989
-Hey! Don! What took you so long?

13:02.072 --> 13:06.577
For starters, I had to battle
this slimy, sucking ground monster

13:06.660 --> 13:08.287
that ate my left boot.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.956
This thing was huge,
like, six or seven feet across

13:11.040 --> 13:14.585
with a death grip like Sister Louise,
who, by the way, in her late eighties,

13:14.668 --> 13:16.212
still a freakishly strong woman.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.464
Mm. Six or seven feet.
That's-- that's big.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.758
Yeah! But that's not
the strangest thing that happened.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.760
I crossed paths with one of these robots.

13:22.843 --> 13:25.012
You did? What happened?

13:25.095 --> 13:26.847
There was nowhere to run!

13:26.931 --> 13:29.183
I saw my beautiful life
flash before my eyes.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.727
But before I was toast, he didn't kill me.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.064
He did this weird thing
with his claws, like--

13:35.147 --> 13:37.650
like, scanning me with a red light.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.486
As if he was trying to guess my price
at a supermarket.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.197
And by the way, if anyone's curious,

13:43.280 --> 13:46.075
sexy astronaut mechanics,
on sale for 2.99.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.452
The robots did the same thing
to Grant Kelly.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.163
Scanned him while he was in cryosleep
on the Fortuna.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.040
The timestamp on that video,

13:53.123 --> 13:55.251
December 21st, 2044,

13:55.334 --> 13:58.337
that was just a few days
before the Christmas Star.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.217
That means that first contact
between humans and alien intelligence

14:03.300 --> 14:04.969
wasn't with Scarecrow on Earth.

14:05.052 --> 14:07.137
It was with Grant Kelly in space.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.391
The Fortuna was their Christmas Star.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.768
But the Fortuna was scrubbed
of all its tracing data.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.229
If the robots were trying to find out
where it came from,

14:15.312 --> 14:17.022
that information wasn't on board.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.566
Yes, it was.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.111
Uh-- we know that the human body

14:22.194 --> 14:25.990
is constantly being impacted
by its environment on an atomic level.

14:26.073 --> 14:30.327
It-- it picks up trace amounts
of particles and chemicals and elements

14:30.411 --> 14:33.330
that we encounter
as we journey through our life.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.375
Some scientists think
that this makes our bodies like a--

14:36.458 --> 14:39.545
a point on a map of the universe,
and that…

14:40.754 --> 14:42.089
with the right equipment,

14:42.715 --> 14:48.429
you can figure out everywhere
a person has ever traveled in their life.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.183
Like following cosmic breadcrumbs.

14:54.101 --> 14:59.023
Okay, so they needed Grant to find Earth,
but they know where we are.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.608
What did they want with Don?

15:03.360 --> 15:07.740
Because Don is the only one here
who's ever been to Alpha Centauri.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.336
No.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.716
What do we do?

15:26.216 --> 15:29.553
Well, we'll… figure it out. Right, Mom?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.309
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.937
Just give me a minute.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.982
Don, what direction did SAR head in?

15:42.066 --> 15:44.443
After he met you? Back toward the ship?

16:18.894 --> 16:20.854
<i>Audio files uploaded.</i>

16:22.189 --> 16:24.400
<i>Vehicle tracking system disabled.</i>

16:32.950 --> 16:35.995
Untense your shoulders.
Relaxed arms means more control.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.246
Yeah. Okay.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.957
Say, why don't we give it some more gas?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.181
We talked about this!
You can't protect me forever!

16:56.265 --> 16:58.350
Help Will Robinson.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.185
Not with this.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.774
If we're really friends,
if you really wanna help me,

17:06.608 --> 17:09.486
then you'll stay here
and make sure my family's safe.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.197
I have to do this.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.783
You have to let me go.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.415
So we launch, get there as fast as we can,
and warn them.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.875
What good is a warning?

17:22.958 --> 17:25.044
How are they gonna fight off
an army of angry robots?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.962
-We've done it before.
-Have we?

17:27.046 --> 17:30.340
Alpha Centauri isn't the Resolute,
Maureen. You can't just blow it up.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.384
We have to give them a fighting chance.

17:32.468 --> 17:36.889
Look, I'm well aware
my instincts aren't the Robinson way,

17:36.972 --> 17:40.309
but there's nothing wrong
with choosing to save ourselves.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.269
We have a robot, an engine.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.979
-We can go anywhere.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.232
Preferably a place
where the ground doesn't try to eat you.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.902
We are not running away from this.

17:52.780 --> 17:57.117
Look, all I'm saying is, if--
if we just put our heads together,

17:57.201 --> 17:58.577
we can come up with a better plan

17:58.660 --> 18:01.205
-that doesn't involve this robot army…
-You okay?

18:01.288 --> 18:03.999
-…obliterating Alpha Centauri…
-We have to go there.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.002
-Maureen, we--
-Help family.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.088
-They might have technology--
-Thank you.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.632
It always feels better when you're here.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.801
They might have resources…

18:30.859 --> 18:33.987
<i> This is Will Robinson</i>
<i>of the 24th Colonist group.</i>

18:34.613 --> 18:36.448
<i>This is my final transmission.</i>

18:36.990 --> 18:41.537
<i>Well, hopefully not my last,</i>
<i>but if you're watching this,</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:46.375
<i>there's a chance things didn't work out</i>
<i>the way I hoped they would.</i>

18:51.755 --> 18:53.757
You're a brave one, Will Robinson.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.884
I'll give you that.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.605
Where are you?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.741
I know you can detect this.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.713
Come and get me.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.978
Will Robinson.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.403
Everything needs to be locked down.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.905
There's stuff everywhere.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.240
Whatever you don't want
hitting you in the face, put away.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.618
-Will you hear me out?
-We need to go!

20:02.701 --> 20:05.954
Maybe the only thing better than us
taking off is making sure that SAR can't!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.289
What are you talking about?

20:07.372 --> 20:10.250
SAR can't attack Alpha Centauri
if SAR can't get there.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.545
So maybe we ground him here
on this planet.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.463
How?

20:14.546 --> 20:17.966
Kamikaze his ass!
Drop a Chariot on him! I don't know.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.470
We don't have time!
SAR could launch at any second.

20:21.553 --> 20:25.349
That's what doesn't make sense. Don,
how long since you got scanned? An hour?

20:25.432 --> 20:26.516
Yeah, give or take.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.894
If the robots have known
about Alpha Centauri since then,

20:28.977 --> 20:30.604
how come SAR hasn't launched yet?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.481
We would've seen or heard him if he had.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.984
Well, maybe his ship is damaged.
He crashed here just like the rest of us.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.947
Maybe he wants more
than a map to Alpha Centauri.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.786
Will, he wants something from Will.
He always has.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.790
Where is Will?

20:51.583 --> 20:52.501
Will?

20:53.460 --> 20:54.419
Will?

20:55.504 --> 20:56.505
Will?

20:57.965 --> 20:58.882
Will?

20:59.591 --> 21:00.425
Will?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.678
Uh… He's gone.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.805
Gone? Gone where?

21:06.390 --> 21:07.975
To try and stop SAR.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.228
How do you know that?

21:14.606 --> 21:15.524
I found this.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.402
He left a message.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.950
<i>This is Will Robinson</i>
<i>of the 24th Colonist group.</i>

21:25.033 --> 21:26.493
I'm sorry, Maureen.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.413
<i>This is my final transmission.</i>

21:30.998 --> 21:33.709
<i>Well, hopefully not my last, but…</i>

21:33.792 --> 21:34.960
Oh, Will.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.212
<i>…if you're watching this…</i>

21:37.296 --> 21:38.463
I should've known.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.800
<i>…there's a chance things didn't work out</i>
<i>the way I hoped they would.</i>

21:41.883 --> 21:43.468
We can't blame ourselves.

22:26.803 --> 22:27.846
I'm gonna go find him!

22:27.929 --> 22:31.475
John! Stop, he's in a Chariot!
We'll never catch him on foot!

22:31.558 --> 22:34.019
Hey! Did you know about this?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.855
Will says you have a connection.
Did you know?

22:36.938 --> 22:40.233
Hey, our only viable option
is to get the Jupiter up in the sky

22:40.317 --> 22:42.027
and-- and search from the air.

22:42.527 --> 22:46.948
We can cover more ground in less time,
and… to hell with staying hidden.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.118
-We need to find Will before SAR does.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.455
-Mom, wait!
-<i>Powering up.</i>

22:53.538 --> 22:56.541
-What if he's doing the right thing?
-What are you talking about?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.877
He's the only one
who can relate to these robots.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.254
What if he's the only one
who can put an end to it?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.589
And what if he's not?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.884
Penny, if there's one thing I've learned
since we got lost,

23:05.967 --> 23:08.303
it's that when you think
you're the only one with answers,

23:08.387 --> 23:09.888
you're usually wrong.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.766
Any sign of the Chariot?

23:54.850 --> 23:58.603
No, I'm not picking anything up.
Will must've disabled the tracking system.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.524
What about SAR?
His metal should reflect the light.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.527
Maybe we can-- we can catch a bounce
off our search beams.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.699
Where are you?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.579
And what do you want with my son?

24:29.176 --> 24:33.597
Will Robinson will come to save you.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.223
But don't worry.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.436
I won't hurt him the way you hurt me.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.938
I want to learn from him.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.692
What do you want to learn?

24:46.943 --> 24:50.614
Why you stopped following
your programming…

24:52.199 --> 24:56.244
Will Robinson did something to you.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.537
Here.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.834
I need to know what it is.

25:02.918 --> 25:04.669
Tell me.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.948
You are weak.

25:33.031 --> 25:37.619
Will Robinson reprogrammed you
to follow his orders.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.663
He controls you now.

25:39.746 --> 25:43.875
Will Robinson does not control me.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.503
Then why do you serve him?

26:18.493 --> 26:19.744
That's a good start.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.959
My name's Will Robinson.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.629
I'm pretty sure you know that already.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.927
When you and I were in the cave,

26:36.886 --> 26:38.597
you wanted to know something.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.059
I-- I wasn't sure what it was then, but…

26:45.770 --> 26:46.855
I think I do now.

26:50.150 --> 26:55.030
You wanted to know what happened
when Robot and I met in the tree, because…

26:56.156 --> 26:58.283
that's when Robot started being different.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.328
Is that right?

27:07.584 --> 27:12.297
Look, I know that sometimes
change can be scary, but…

27:14.716 --> 27:17.636
it can also help you become
better than you were before.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.641
Do you understand what programming is?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.694
Are you asking about the heart?

27:38.073 --> 27:41.493
Yeah. The heart is actually
a form of programming, I guess.

27:41.993 --> 27:42.869
It…

27:44.329 --> 27:45.914
it can tell us how to act…

27:47.999 --> 27:49.084
what to risk…

27:52.087 --> 27:53.296
who our friends are.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.511
Hearts can also be broken.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.473
Just like your programming can be broken.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.726
But it's what we do afterwards
that matters.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.733
There's something you need to know.

28:14.651 --> 28:15.860
Your masters,

28:16.903 --> 28:19.364
the beings who programmed you, they're…

28:20.532 --> 28:22.158
…they're not here anymore.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.084
They're extinct.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.548
I don't know what happened to them, but…

28:37.382 --> 28:40.552
whatever it is they wanted you to do,
it doesn't matter anymore.

28:41.594 --> 28:42.679
They're gone.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.640
You can choose your own programming.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.726
You can do whatever you want.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.234
Does…

28:58.528 --> 29:00.613
Does knowing they're gone make you sad?

29:01.114 --> 29:04.367
Sometimes our…
our hearts can hurt when we're sad.

29:05.118 --> 29:07.287
Not sad.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.833
Do you know how they died?

29:13.084 --> 29:15.712
I killed them.

29:18.965 --> 29:21.551
Danger, Will Robinson.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.430
Over there! Two o'clock!

29:26.055 --> 29:27.140
Everybody, hold on!

29:33.146 --> 29:36.691
Uh-- oh-- I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

29:36.775 --> 29:39.694
Kill all masters.

29:40.695 --> 29:41.613
No!

29:42.906 --> 29:46.534
Now kill heart.

29:57.712 --> 30:00.215
Please. Please, you have to listen to me.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.716
No programming.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.343
I don't wanna program you!

30:03.426 --> 30:05.720
No masters.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.971
Robot!

30:07.055 --> 30:08.973
No heart.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.193
Now you are free.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.000
Will!

30:40.922 --> 30:42.382
Will!

30:44.843 --> 30:46.719
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>when this all started?</i>

30:50.515 --> 30:52.225
We all just wanted a fresh start.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.145
Not just a new home, but…

30:57.397 --> 30:58.940
a fresh start with each other.

31:02.235 --> 31:05.363
<i>And no matter how many different times</i>
<i>things have gone wrong,</i>

31:06.865 --> 31:08.700
<i>to have spent this time together…</i>

31:13.121 --> 31:14.831
<i>I don't regret anything.</i>

31:18.626 --> 31:20.336
<i>Mom, Dad,</i>

31:21.754 --> 31:22.672
<i>I love you.</i>

31:23.172 --> 31:25.091
<i>I try to be like you both every day.</i>

31:28.720 --> 31:29.637
<i>And, Judy,</i>

31:31.306 --> 31:32.807
<i>you never left my side.</i>

31:33.892 --> 31:37.145
<i>And, Penny, you always had my back.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.529
<i>Don, you were like a brother to me.</i>

31:47.655 --> 31:48.740
<i>And, Smith,</i>

31:50.199 --> 31:52.201
<i>maybe you're not so bad after all.</i>

31:59.667 --> 32:00.543
<i>Robot,</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:03.796
<i>you're the best friend I ever had.</i>

32:19.729 --> 32:21.522
<i>Take care of my family for me.</i>

32:30.365 --> 32:34.953
<i>I'm doing this so you all can survive</i>
<i>because you're what matters most to me.</i>

32:36.955 --> 32:38.081
You're my family,

32:39.624 --> 32:40.750
and I love you.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.052
<i>I just hope it's enough.</i>

33:07.986 --> 33:09.529
Get his jacket undone.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.158
His pulse is there, just barely.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.330
It's okay.

33:19.998 --> 33:20.957
I'm here.

33:21.582 --> 33:22.792
Dad's here.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.460
Let's get his suit off.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.920
Here, here, here.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.463
-Okay.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.424
Okay, I got him.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.466
Okay.

33:31.759 --> 33:32.969
Okay.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.430
You were supposed
to stop this from happening.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.349
We trusted you.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.686
You were supposed to protect him!

34:02.707 --> 34:05.585
He keeps bleeding. I don't have
the equipment I need to stop it.

34:05.668 --> 34:09.672
I can't perform open-heart surgery
on the Jupiter. He needs a real hospital.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.799
Where are we gonna find
a hospital in space?

34:14.802 --> 34:15.803
Alpha Centauri.

34:18.139 --> 34:21.100
-Isn't that where SAR's going?
-Yes, we're gonna warn them.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.685
We're gonna save Will's life.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.397
Hold on, hold on! Mom, Mom!
He won't survive the trip!

34:26.481 --> 34:27.690
We have to try!

34:28.941 --> 34:30.693
Strap him down. Do everything you can.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.694
Wait, the cryotube!

34:31.778 --> 34:36.115
It slows down circulation so
there's not so much stress on his heart.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.118
If we put him to sleep,
then his heart's not working so hard.

34:39.869 --> 34:40.995
He'll have a chance.

34:41.621 --> 34:42.455
Do it.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.250
Okay. Come here. Come on.

34:46.334 --> 34:47.418
Hey.

34:47.502 --> 34:48.628
Okay.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.606
Come on. It's time to go.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.987
I know some people think
you don't have feelings.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.656
I know that you do.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.575
But right now, I need you to bury them.

35:20.618 --> 35:22.954
I need you to put them away
in a little box

35:23.037 --> 35:26.916
so you can focus on what it is you need
to do to get us out of this situation.

35:26.999 --> 35:30.336
Whatever you've done in the past
doesn't matter.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.588
Only what you do next.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.841
And right now,

35:35.967 --> 35:39.804
getting Will to Alpha Centauri
is the only thing that matters.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.612
<i>Cryo-sequence initiating.</i>

35:56.696 --> 35:57.655
We need to go.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.882
<i>Unidentified launch detected.</i>

36:15.965 --> 36:17.466
SAR is taking off.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.261
Are we gonna make it in time?

36:21.387 --> 36:23.598
We have to.
