WEBVTT

00:01.591 --> 00:04.478
Halloween... a time of vampires,

00:04.479 --> 00:08.624
hobgoblins, Draculas,
boogens, and headless mice.

00:08.625 --> 00:10.302
I'm George Takei.

00:10.602 --> 00:11.660
You know what?

00:11.661 --> 00:13.402
Let's just get to it.

00:15.612 --> 00:17.295
- Mm-hmm.
- How is it?

00:18.190 --> 00:19.864
Pretty good taco meat.

00:19.865 --> 00:21.951
I wonder how the dean
scored this sweet spread.

00:21.952 --> 00:22.796
Ah, ah, ah.

00:22.797 --> 00:25.710
Chef gaga never
reveals her caterer.

00:25.711 --> 00:29.128
And don't try reading
my p-p-p-poker face.

00:29.509 --> 00:32.755
It's military rations
from an army surplus store.

00:35.299 --> 00:36.145
I didn't read your poker face.

00:36.146 --> 00:37.850
You left the containers
in the garbage.

00:38.387 --> 00:41.015
Oh, well, um, you guys have fun.

00:41.016 --> 00:42.885
I'm gonna... gonna
take out the garbage.

00:42.886 --> 00:45.314
Oh, you may also want to
adjust your iTunes setting.

00:45.315 --> 00:49.083
When it's not playing an endless
loop of Abba's greatest hits,

00:49.094 --> 00:52.456
it's playing what I think may
be your personal voice memos.

00:52.457 --> 00:53.190
What?

00:53.191 --> 00:55.918
Note to self... get oil changed,

00:55.919 --> 00:58.704
check Netflix for that
movie where Greg Kinnear...

00:58.705 --> 01:01.193
Plays a ghost... no, an angel...

01:01.199 --> 01:03.346
and something called human centi...

01:06.223 --> 01:07.641
- David Beckham.
- Hmm.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.125
Dragon turtle?

01:09.252 --> 01:10.312
T-Rex.

01:10.645 --> 01:12.308
Man, I wonder how much effort

01:12.309 --> 01:14.425
you put into being
accidentally handsome

01:14.426 --> 01:16.006
for a costume every year.

01:16.007 --> 01:17.513
Only half the effort
you'll be putting

01:17.514 --> 01:19.285
into eating and drinking tonight.

01:19.286 --> 01:21.433
Let me help you, dragon turtle.

01:21.434 --> 01:23.794
Guys, Shirley's
costume is once again

01:23.795 --> 01:25.230
unwittingly ambiguous.

01:25.231 --> 01:26.586
I don't know what
she's supposed to be,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.490
but I do know she's
not miss piggy.

01:28.491 --> 01:31.094
I repeat... she is not miss piggy.

01:31.107 --> 01:32.433
You're on your own.

01:32.719 --> 01:35.335
Hello! Guess who I am.

01:36.672 --> 01:38.688
Um, can't you just say?

01:38.689 --> 01:40.005
No.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.110
Pierce, are you okay?

01:44.111 --> 01:45.934
Huh? What? Huh?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.069
Whoa.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.866
Hey, if you get any
more sweaty and puffy,

01:49.867 --> 01:52.410
your costume's gonna reach
new levels of authenticity.

01:52.411 --> 01:54.109
Oh, I don't understand. Shut up.

01:55.270 --> 01:56.709
He's acting like
the impression of him

01:56.710 --> 01:58.077
we do behind his back.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.796
Get away from me!

02:05.126 --> 02:07.193
Oh, man, just when
you think it's funny.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.199
Pierce?

02:08.250 --> 02:09.978
Okay, okay, okay. Ooh.

02:10.358 --> 02:12.017
Oh, excuse me.

02:12.034 --> 02:13.858
I think my friend is really sick.

02:13.859 --> 02:14.899
I'm not a doctor.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.941
I'm a doctor.

02:17.143 --> 02:19.196
Annie! Rich from pottery class.

02:19.197 --> 02:21.461
- Oh, hey!
- Oh, hey.

02:21.628 --> 02:22.976
Wow, this looks serious. - Yeah.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.598
Let's... you know what?
Let's get him over here.

02:24.599 --> 02:25.760
- Okay.
- Oh, boy.

02:25.761 --> 02:28.810
He is just not in very
good shape, is he?

02:28.886 --> 02:30.420
But you look fantastic.

02:30.421 --> 02:32.146
Oh, thank you.

02:32.147 --> 02:34.646
Look at you with your hood.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.533 --> 02:48.266
Get away from those hotties!

03:04.417 --> 03:05.551
You're safe now.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.932
But if that thing comes back,
I'm gonna need

03:07.933 --> 03:09.447
one or both of your phone numbers.

03:09.448 --> 03:11.819
Yeah, right.

03:18.593 --> 03:19.625
I don't get it.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.781
How do you do it?

03:21.782 --> 03:24.419
Well, I am wearing
a $6,000 suit,

03:24.420 --> 03:27.573
and you spent 3 days making
cardboard robot armor.

03:27.584 --> 03:29.431
You're saying they
feel sorry for you?

03:29.510 --> 03:30.950
I'm saying I remind girls less

03:30.951 --> 03:33.385
of taking their little
brothers to comic-con.

03:34.979 --> 03:36.803
- Rich.
- More?

03:37.002 --> 03:38.373
Put her with the others.

03:39.134 --> 03:41.233
102... this may be food poisoning.

03:41.234 --> 03:43.202
Rich, what did I tell you?

03:43.203 --> 03:45.096
- To rule out food poisoning.
- Yes.

03:45.097 --> 03:47.078
But also not to say
the words out loud.

03:47.079 --> 03:49.313
Who wants to walk my plank, huh?

03:49.351 --> 03:50.144
Hey.

04:01.797 --> 04:03.382
Okay, I'm ruling
out food poisoning.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.832
Guess who I am.

04:37.052 --> 04:38.159
Michelle Kwan?

04:38.160 --> 04:39.056
Wrong.

04:39.194 --> 04:40.479
Kristi Yamaguchi?

04:40.484 --> 04:41.586
Peggy Fleming.

04:41.968 --> 04:43.711
Just been proven racist

04:43.712 --> 04:45.685
by the racist-prover.

04:47.336 --> 04:49.668
Hey, guess who I am.

04:49.669 --> 04:50.627
Drink.

04:52.436 --> 04:53.753
Have you noticed a weird vibe

04:53.754 --> 04:55.198
taking a hold of this party?

04:55.507 --> 04:57.411
It's like every fifth
person is on something

04:57.412 --> 04:59.001
seriously hard-core.

04:59.802 --> 05:01.517
Yeah, I wonder who's holding...

05:01.582 --> 05:03.521
The key to your riddle.

05:06.191 --> 05:07.866
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:10.924 --> 05:12.041
Where's your costume?

05:12.063 --> 05:13.378
Trying something new.

05:13.403 --> 05:15.717
But our costumes go together,
and if you're not in yours,

05:15.718 --> 05:17.453
I'm just a guy in a spandex
suit and a bike helmet.

05:17.454 --> 05:20.895
- Well, I'm a sexy Dracula.
- You mean vampire.

05:20.896 --> 05:23.327
I don't need to know
which Dracula I am

05:23.328 --> 05:24.546
to be a Dracula.

05:24.637 --> 05:25.740
Nerd.

05:31.596 --> 05:33.272
Your symptoms are
progressing even faster

05:33.273 --> 05:34.480
than everyone else's.

05:34.481 --> 05:36.597
How much of that taco-meat
stuff did you eat, star-burns?

05:36.598 --> 05:37.980
I didn't eat any.

05:38.352 --> 05:39.907
My name is Alex!

05:39.908 --> 05:41.006
Whatever it is
must have transferred

05:41.007 --> 05:42.356
through Pierce's bite.

05:42.357 --> 05:43.963
My God, I think you're right.

05:44.347 --> 05:46.204
Annie, you make quite
the little nurse.

05:46.205 --> 05:47.648
Thank you, rich.

05:47.826 --> 05:49.703
You're quite a banana.

05:49.704 --> 05:52.794
Jeez, why don't you
guys just get a roo...

06:00.600 --> 06:02.364
but the only people getting sick

06:02.365 --> 06:05.918
are the ones eating what I
bought at your surplus store.

06:05.919 --> 06:08.217
I never said the
stuff was delicious,

06:08.218 --> 06:09.262
but you can't get sick from it.

06:09.263 --> 06:10.411
It's nonperishable.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.058
What about the taco-meat stuff...

06:12.059 --> 06:13.721
the classic flavor? - The what?

06:14.279 --> 06:15.837
The one with the goofy label.

06:15.838 --> 06:17.479
Here.

06:17.480 --> 06:19.103
"Classified Phoenix.

06:19.104 --> 06:21.082
"If found, repeat key phrase...

06:21.083 --> 06:23.783
echo, tango, X-ray,
nine, nine, seven."

06:23.784 --> 06:25.580
Yeah. Sounds delicious.

06:25.581 --> 06:28.595
Anyway, it looks
like taco meat and...

06:30.297 --> 06:31.157
hello?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.740
Greendale community college?

06:33.623 --> 06:34.624
Speaking.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.185
This is special
operations officer McHenry.

06:38.152 --> 06:39.222
Hi.

06:39.335 --> 06:42.622
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.724
Okay, one hint.

06:45.725 --> 06:48.200
I'm a beloved character
from our childhood.

06:48.201 --> 06:50.543
- I can't stop seeing it.
- I know.

06:53.105 --> 06:55.519
Leonard, behave yourself.
I'm a Christian woman.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.659
Leonard, you better back
that pumpkin ass up,

06:57.660 --> 06:59.167
or I will make a pie.

07:01.466 --> 07:03.763
Hey, Jeff, it's me, rich,
from pottery class.

07:04.134 --> 07:05.547
"Doc Potterywood," remember?
'Cause we were...

07:05.548 --> 07:06.940
- rich, bigger fish.
- Yeah.

07:06.941 --> 07:08.789
Guys, there's some kind
of infection at the party

07:08.790 --> 07:10.982
that's making people act
weird and bite each other.

07:10.983 --> 07:12.832
We need to coordinate
an orderly evacuation

07:12.833 --> 07:14.685
without causing unnecessary panic.

07:16.199 --> 07:17.289
Holy crap!

07:17.290 --> 07:18.689
Leonard's a zombie!

07:20.579 --> 07:21.906
Zombie attack!

07:26.425 --> 07:27.482
Never mind.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.207
Oh, my God! Ah!

07:42.459 --> 07:44.552
- I'm sorry.
- Open the door!

07:44.553 --> 07:46.861
I've been told we need
a little baby quarantine

07:46.862 --> 07:48.166
until the army gets here.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.282
The army?

07:49.283 --> 07:50.744
I know, right?

07:51.273 --> 07:53.318
They said to wait for six hours.

07:53.754 --> 07:54.847
Stay strong.

07:54.848 --> 07:55.881
Guys...

07:56.181 --> 07:58.558
I hate to be the
"we've got company" guy, but...

07:58.581 --> 07:59.635
oh!

08:04.070 --> 08:06.492
Hey, guess who I am.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.618
Or don't.

08:11.723 --> 08:12.762
Head to the back!

08:14.871 --> 08:15.937
Run!

08:28.784 --> 08:30.649
You punched a lady bee!

08:32.813 --> 08:34.073
No!

08:35.043 --> 08:38.321
Let go of the door,
you little bitch!

08:38.354 --> 08:39.344
Welcome!

08:39.505 --> 08:41.366
Oh, thank God you're all right!

08:42.655 --> 08:43.871
Whoo! We did it!

08:48.434 --> 08:50.537
Okay, did we lose
anybody out there?

08:50.538 --> 08:51.631
- No.
- Is anybody hurt?

08:51.632 --> 08:52.541
No.

08:52.542 --> 08:54.616
Okay, last question,
and I know it's a long shot,

08:54.617 --> 08:57.134
but did anybody happen to
shut off the dean's playlist?

08:57.135 --> 09:00.056
Two percent milk, eggs,
deodorant, puppy chow...

09:00.952 --> 09:04.494
Okay, it's a officially
a waking nightmare.

09:10.387 --> 09:12.351
When are the police coming?

09:12.411 --> 09:14.238
- Help is on the way.
- Hello?

09:14.239 --> 09:15.761
Help is on the way.

09:15.762 --> 09:17.614
- Hello?
- Help is on the way.

09:17.634 --> 09:19.070
Flavor flav was right.

09:19.071 --> 09:20.651
It's the end of days.

09:20.652 --> 09:22.177
It can't be the end of days.

09:22.178 --> 09:23.692
It's not 2012 yet.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.167
It's not the end of days.

09:25.168 --> 09:26.950
There seems to be a
rabies-related pathogen

09:26.951 --> 09:29.012
affecting the prefrontal
cortex of the brain,

09:29.013 --> 09:30.492
causing hyper aggression.

09:30.493 --> 09:32.610
It could take years for
it to take over the world.

09:32.611 --> 09:34.797
- How many years?
- 1, 1 1/2.

09:35.465 --> 09:37.198
2012! End of days!

09:37.199 --> 09:39.330
End of days! End of days!

09:40.094 --> 09:41.036
Good thinking, Jeff...

09:41.037 --> 09:42.120
vertical fold.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.109
You making fun of me?

09:44.653 --> 09:46.576
That jacket is worth
more than the island

09:46.577 --> 09:48.561
you were grown on, Chiquita M.D.

09:48.781 --> 09:50.400
"Chiquita m. D."... I like it.

09:50.401 --> 09:52.678
Rich, this is a good time to
let you know that I hate you.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.233
Shouldn't we be
barricading the room?

09:54.234 --> 09:55.955
I don't know.
These guys don't seem so...

09:55.956 --> 09:57.596
- Argh!
- I will help you.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.617
Wait! Wait!

09:58.618 --> 10:00.162
Before you barricade us in,
I need to ask

10:00.163 --> 10:01.521
if anyone has been bitten.

10:01.522 --> 10:03.626
You bit, huh? You bit?

10:03.627 --> 10:05.914
This pathogen is
spread through bites,

10:05.915 --> 10:07.821
so if anyone has been
bitten and you allow us

10:07.822 --> 10:09.416
to seal ourselves
in here with you,

10:09.417 --> 10:11.787
you're putting us all in danger.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.525
All right, go ahead.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.733
Are we really
just gonna sit here?

10:20.734 --> 10:22.879
The army's gonna
be here in six hours.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.268
Why six hours?
Are they hosting the Oscars?

10:25.269 --> 10:26.269
Damn.

10:26.270 --> 10:28.134
And the winner for best
adapted Oscar burn,

10:28.141 --> 10:31.113
Jeff winger for "oh,
snap! The man who went there."

10:31.114 --> 10:32.796
Those people don't
have six hours.

10:32.797 --> 10:35.124
Judging from the temperatures
of those infected...

10:35.698 --> 10:37.067
Within three hours,
they're gonna start suffering

10:37.068 --> 10:37.905
from brain damage.

10:37.906 --> 10:39.578
Three hours after that,
they're gonna be dead.

10:39.579 --> 10:41.543
What? We have to do
something for them.

10:41.544 --> 10:44.060
Do something? For the zombies?

10:44.061 --> 10:45.842
If we lower the temperature
of the whole building,

10:45.908 --> 10:47.887
would it break the fever
and kill the virus?

10:48.840 --> 10:49.946
It might.

10:51.007 --> 10:53.110
I know where the thermostat is...
out there on the wall.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.847
Troy, we have to rise to
the occasion like Ripley

10:55.848 --> 10:57.018
and kick monster
butt in our undies.

10:57.019 --> 10:58.460
I'm not Ripley, Abed.

10:58.461 --> 11:00.456
I'm a cool, sexy Dracula.

11:00.457 --> 11:02.186
I make love to ladies,
and I survive.

11:02.187 --> 11:03.106
I'm with Troy.

11:03.107 --> 11:05.070
Guys, those are not zombies.

11:05.071 --> 11:07.122
Those are our classmates,
and they're sick.

11:07.123 --> 11:08.943
And they can make
us sick by biting us.

11:08.944 --> 11:10.743
The banana said so. - It's true.

11:10.744 --> 11:12.404
The incubation only takes minutes.

11:12.551 --> 11:13.856
First, you get a stomachache.

11:13.857 --> 11:16.443
Then your skin turns red,
followed by cold sweats.

11:16.444 --> 11:18.288
Muscle spasms, high fever,

11:18.559 --> 11:21.211
and then the uncontrollable
urge to bite uninfected flesh.

11:21.212 --> 11:22.253
Oh, Jesus.

11:22.254 --> 11:23.697
And I forgot one symptom.

11:24.483 --> 11:27.007
Slurred speech.

11:27.008 --> 11:29.419
Hey, you got bit!

11:29.902 --> 11:32.583
I felt like maybe I was special.

11:32.634 --> 11:34.688
Special? You're not special.

11:34.689 --> 11:35.899
I'm special.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.402
I was bit ten minutes ago,
and I'm...

11:38.403 --> 11:39.940
Fine.

11:40.027 --> 11:41.130
Oh, great.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.073
Nobody is special!

11:43.074 --> 11:46.334
Hey, rich, just so you know,
I hate you less now.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.717
That's how much I
hate your normal self.

11:49.318 --> 11:50.960
You have to destroy his brain.

11:53.687 --> 11:55.059
What the hell?

11:59.190 --> 12:02.694
- A hamster!
- Way to go!

12:02.695 --> 12:03.403
Run!

12:03.404 --> 12:05.172
Run! Run!

12:11.251 --> 12:12.713
Head for the stairs!

12:16.637 --> 12:19.060
- What about Annie?
- Don't look back!

12:19.061 --> 12:20.275
Why not?

12:20.285 --> 12:21.237
Oh!

12:21.447 --> 12:23.223
Shirley, oh, God.

12:23.427 --> 12:24.689
Don't look back!

12:26.147 --> 12:27.038
Oh!

12:39.012 --> 12:42.693
Oh, this is how I die...
As miss piggy.

12:42.776 --> 12:44.010
You're not miss piggy.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.603
You're Glenda the good witch.

12:45.604 --> 12:47.989
Oh! You knew?

12:48.933 --> 12:51.684
Just so you know,
I've always loved Peggy Fleming.

12:53.249 --> 12:54.489
You're not racist.

12:54.490 --> 12:55.448
Mm-mm.

13:11.314 --> 13:12.503
Oh, cool.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.559
A dark basement.

13:14.709 --> 13:17.334
I was just thinking we should be
doing this in a dark basement.

13:18.279 --> 13:20.134
Troy, why did you
ditch your costume?

13:20.589 --> 13:23.480
Why bring that up now,
Abed? We might die down here.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.280
All the more reason
to get this ironed out.

13:25.432 --> 13:28.162
You called me a nerd up there.
What defines a nerd...

13:28.163 --> 13:29.877
committing to an awesome
Halloween costume

13:29.878 --> 13:30.828
with your best friend?

13:30.829 --> 13:31.741
Is that what nerds do?

13:31.742 --> 13:33.740
I don't know, Abed,
because I'm not a nerd,

13:33.741 --> 13:36.513
which is why I'm not taking
part in this very conversation.

13:36.514 --> 13:37.698
Shh! Nerds.

13:38.581 --> 13:39.712
Did you hear that?

13:42.658 --> 13:43.728
Jeez!

13:46.302 --> 13:47.788
It was just a cat.

13:47.811 --> 13:48.926
Let's keep moving.

13:50.624 --> 13:52.861
Oh! Holy crap!

13:57.333 --> 13:59.158
What is up with that cat?

13:59.159 --> 14:01.482
- Is someone throwing it?
- Let's keep moving.

14:01.607 --> 14:02.731
No!

14:02.732 --> 14:04.287
Let's not keep moving,

14:04.288 --> 14:06.722
because there is an
insane cat down here.

14:06.723 --> 14:08.026
Well, what about the zombies?

14:08.027 --> 14:10.614
Back burner, Troy!
This cat has to be dealt with.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.813
There it is! Grab it!

14:16.417 --> 14:18.013
This should lead upstairs.
The thermostat will be...

14:18.014 --> 14:19.824
enough with the
thermostat, Abed.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.687
This is not pretend play time,
save-the-world time.

14:22.688 --> 14:23.758
It's quarter past

14:23.759 --> 14:26.909
let's-get-the-hell-
out-of-this-building time.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.019
There. There's a window.

14:30.279 --> 14:31.740
All right, if we climb
that dusty fence,

14:31.741 --> 14:32.759
we can hoist each
other against he wall

14:32.760 --> 14:34.018
and then squeeze through it.

14:36.046 --> 14:37.275
I vote we take the door.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.793
He doesn't want
to dirty his suit.

14:40.479 --> 14:41.790
For real?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.389
Clothes make the man, Troy.

14:43.546 --> 14:45.477
What the... hey! Ah!

14:45.564 --> 14:46.622
Whoa!

14:50.053 --> 14:51.590
That's my jacket!

14:52.819 --> 14:55.019
My jacket... you're stretching it!

14:55.020 --> 14:57.495
You're stretching it!

14:58.744 --> 15:01.506
Wrong way! Go! Go! Go! Go!

15:31.458 --> 15:33.050
- Go.
- I'm not going without you!

15:33.051 --> 15:34.897
Troy, make me proud.

15:34.898 --> 15:36.956
Be the first black man
to make it to the end.

15:40.188 --> 15:41.334
Go, go, go, go, go!

15:43.713 --> 15:44.528
Abed!

15:47.497 --> 15:48.561
I love you.

15:48.593 --> 15:49.638
I know.

15:52.046 --> 15:52.900
Make it fast.

15:52.901 --> 15:54.547
No!

16:07.599 --> 16:09.684
Troy, be honest.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.698
Are you a zombie? I will mace you.

16:11.699 --> 16:12.895
Give me the keys.

16:12.993 --> 16:14.156
Those people are gonna
get brain damage

16:14.157 --> 16:15.387
if someone doesn't help 'em.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.119
Okay, Troy,
there is something called

16:17.120 --> 16:18.762
"chain of command,
" so unfortunately...

16:18.763 --> 16:19.731
oh!

16:22.709 --> 16:24.016
Are you crazy?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.246
How are you gonna
survive those zombies?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.149
I'm gonna be a nerd.

16:30.941 --> 16:32.762
Better have a plan "b"!

16:42.154 --> 16:43.173
That's right.

16:43.776 --> 16:46.407
Prepare to meet the
power of imagination.

16:50.211 --> 16:51.548
Ugh! Okay.

16:51.608 --> 16:53.468
All right, I don't know why
I thought this would work.

16:53.469 --> 16:54.936
Hey, get off me!

16:54.937 --> 16:57.001
Get off... you're so strong!

16:57.382 --> 16:58.543
God, I hate this!

16:59.044 --> 16:59.617
Get off!

16:59.618 --> 17:01.106
Stop using your mouth!

17:03.937 --> 17:05.021
Hello, zombie Annie.

17:05.088 --> 17:06.522
What big fists you have...

17:06.523 --> 17:07.872
In your face!

17:09.013 --> 17:09.820
Whoa!

17:11.955 --> 17:13.314
Beam this up, Scotty.

17:13.583 --> 17:14.771
In your face!

17:19.638 --> 17:20.628
Zombie Shirley...

17:20.821 --> 17:22.400
I don't know what you are, but...

17:22.401 --> 17:23.909
in your face!

17:25.851 --> 17:28.492
Abed, we're friends.

17:28.978 --> 17:30.560
Ah! Abed, no!

17:30.672 --> 17:31.994
Ah, Britta!

17:33.320 --> 17:34.483
Okay, okay.

17:34.484 --> 17:35.837
I've been bit, y'all.

17:35.838 --> 17:37.702
Dag. Congrats.

17:37.703 --> 17:39.180
You did what the zombies do.

17:51.527 --> 17:54.592
Jeff, still cool as a zombie.

17:55.090 --> 17:56.549
Mah!

19:02.920 --> 19:04.292
Out of the way! Out of the way!

19:04.293 --> 19:05.345
Out of the way!

19:08.410 --> 19:10.355
- You dean Pelton?
- Speaking.

19:10.726 --> 19:12.773
Wow. Six hours on the dot.

19:12.774 --> 19:14.580
Yeah, well,
practice makes perfect.

19:14.657 --> 19:15.781
You the only witness?

19:15.782 --> 19:16.937
I am.

19:17.178 --> 19:18.208
All right.

19:18.313 --> 19:20.317
Hey, we got uninfected in here.

19:20.339 --> 19:21.577
How many we talking?

19:22.007 --> 19:23.346
I think it might be all of 'em.

19:24.103 --> 19:25.867
All right, scenario "b."

19:25.868 --> 19:27.211
Repeat, scenario "b."

19:27.514 --> 19:29.152
Let's dose these suckers.

19:29.153 --> 19:31.146
Dose what now? Oh!

19:48.177 --> 19:51.495
So you remember nothing past
your decision to be lady gaga?

19:52.170 --> 19:54.439
Can't believe that
somebody would mass-roofie

19:54.440 --> 19:56.096
an entire party.

19:56.097 --> 19:57.523
I can't believe it wasn't me.

19:57.524 --> 19:59.060
I can't believe I believe you...

19:59.443 --> 20:00.636
And I don't.

20:02.007 --> 20:03.239
Want to watch a movie?

20:03.613 --> 20:04.612
Sure.

20:04.713 --> 20:06.627
Aliens, cyborgs, or zombies?

20:06.750 --> 20:09.681
I don't know why,
but I'm kind of over zombies.

20:09.682 --> 20:12.339
Yeah, I don't feel like
anything action-heavy.

20:12.668 --> 20:13.800
How about something light?

20:13.801 --> 20:14.950
You seen Marmaduke?

20:14.951 --> 20:18.339
And so Troy and Abed
went back to the dormitory

20:18.340 --> 20:20.786
for a viewing of Marmaduke.

20:20.994 --> 20:24.159
I'm George Takei,
and if you're name is Kevin,

20:24.160 --> 20:26.888
here's a little freebie
for your cell phone.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.383
Hi, Kevin can't come to the phone.

20:29.384 --> 20:32.315
He's on a spaceship with me,
George Takei.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.963
Please leave a message.

20:34.156 --> 20:35.913
You're welcome Kevins.

20:37.212 --> 20:39.147
Happy Halloween.

20:43.224 --> 20:44.118
Voice mail?

20:47.171 --> 20:49.372
Troy! This is Chang.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.825
There's not much time.

20:50.987 --> 20:52.416
I don't think we're gonna make it.

20:52.564 --> 20:54.812
Listen, if you survive,

20:54.858 --> 20:57.646
please spread this message for me.

20:58.065 --> 21:00.447
Shirley and I totally did it!

21:00.448 --> 21:01.751
Shh! Chang, what are you doing?

21:01.752 --> 21:02.703
Nothing.

21:03.974 --> 21:04.926
Gotta go!

21:08.111 --> 21:09.847
Why did he call me?
