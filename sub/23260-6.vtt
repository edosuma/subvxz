WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:06.540
.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.308
- Previously
on "Falling Water"...

00:08.576 --> 00:10.044
- My pods allow dreamers

00:10.078 --> 00:11.412
to connect with
anyone, anywhere.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.681
- They won't let me go.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.386
- We found the girl
from the dream.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.388
- We're talking
human trafficking

00:20.421 --> 00:22.590
and the murder of a reporter...

00:22.623 --> 00:24.125
...by a politician

00:24.158 --> 00:25.526
to keep it all
from getting out.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.261
This isn't just about
Shadowman anymore.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.097
This is a full-on conspiracy.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.564
- We put this out tomorrow,

00:30.598 --> 00:32.133
there's no way
Harding's campaign can survive

00:32.166 --> 00:33.567
this kind of a scandal.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.138
- It didn't have to go
down that way.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
- Bullshit it didn't.
- You're under

00:38.439 --> 00:40.108
the false assumption that
you're the one

00:40.141 --> 00:41.442
in control of things.
Go home

00:41.475 --> 00:42.710
and wait for
your next assignment

00:42.743 --> 00:44.778
like a good little boy.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.380
- There's someone out there

00:46.414 --> 00:48.416
who's entering
people's dreams

00:48.449 --> 00:50.251
and manipulating them
to commit murder.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.820
- I killed my wife,
but God help me,

00:52.853 --> 00:55.789
I don't know why.

00:55.823 --> 01:00.128
To strip you of everything...

01:00.161 --> 01:02.096
like you did to me.

01:10.804 --> 01:18.212
*

01:22.750 --> 01:30.124
*

01:32.493 --> 01:36.530
I can hear you!
Who's there?

01:36.564 --> 01:43.504
*

01:53.881 --> 02:01.054
*

02:28.282 --> 02:35.456
*

02:40.961 --> 02:42.563
Alex?

02:44.465 --> 02:46.234
- Hey.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.269
Your cell phone's been off.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.572
- Yeah.
That's because I turned it off.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.410
- You're in the same clothes
you wore yesterday.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.945
- I didn't realize we
had a fashion shoot today.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.580
What's your problem?
- No problem.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.948
Just, you know,
want to know why

03:00.981 --> 03:03.384
you're sleeping
in a holding cell.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.822
Because I'm worried about
what this dream asshole

03:08.856 --> 03:11.692
might make me do to myself--
or worse, to Christy.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.828
If this guy's real,
after what he did to you

03:14.862 --> 03:18.332
and Sabine and your mother,
I'm not taking any chances.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.268
- Alex--
- And before you start talking

03:20.301 --> 03:21.935
with that guilty look
on your face, don't.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.737
I'm not your problem.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.307
I'm fine.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.376
You got enough on your plate.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.345
But anyway, I'm up

03:31.379 --> 03:33.647
and in desperate need
of coffee.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.449
- We need to follow up
on this Ralston recording.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.318
- The problem is,
everything we have

03:37.351 --> 03:38.719
on Taylor Bennett--
- Yeah, is circumstantial

03:38.752 --> 03:39.753
and hearsay.
I know.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.255
- And the whole dance ends

03:41.289 --> 03:42.990
with the reporter and Ralston
pushing daisies

03:43.023 --> 03:44.425
after they each off themselves.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.993
- A seeming cluster
of dead ends.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.795
- And dead people.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.730
There's nothing that ties
any of this to the killer.

03:49.763 --> 03:55.603
So unless we find a witness
to something--anything--

03:55.636 --> 03:57.771
we got nothing.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.540
- You're absolutely right.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.709
A witness is exactly
what we need.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.044
Come on.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.715
- * All the money

04:07.748 --> 04:10.784
- * I ever spent

04:12.420 --> 04:15.423
- * I spent it
in good company *

04:15.456 --> 04:17.625
- It's okay, Lainie.
You don't need to be afraid.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.892
You're safe now.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.398
* Good night

04:24.432 --> 04:28.636
* And joy be with you all

04:30.438 --> 04:32.540
* Good night

04:32.573 --> 04:38.278
* And joy be with you all

04:41.882 --> 04:45.486
Where are you?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.391
You're okay.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.897
- You've been drugged.
But you're safe now.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.633
Burton and I, we found you.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.773
Some people were trying
to sell you.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.376
- I don't believe you.
I wanna wake up.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.947
If I'm safe,
then help me wake up.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.416
- The drug has to wear off.

05:15.449 --> 05:17.551
- I don't believe you.
I want to wake up now.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.852
I wanna wake up now.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.854
Do you hear me?
I wanna wake up now!

05:22.590 --> 05:25.693
- Lainie.
Lainie, where are you?

05:28.128 --> 05:30.864
- Lainie, you can trust me.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.934
- Please, Lainie.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.103
- Want to wake up...
- I'll stay with you.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.805
- I wanna wake up!

05:44.845 --> 05:51.885
*

05:56.990 --> 05:58.892
*

05:58.926 --> 06:00.461
- Woody.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.396
- Come on, man.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.132
Get up.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.601
- You gotta go before
Buck comes in.

06:07.635 --> 06:08.969
If he finds out
I let you sleep here,

06:09.002 --> 06:11.138
he'll chew my ass out.
- Ugh. Rafferty, please.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.474
It's too early for that
kind of imagery.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.444
- I'm serious.
Wag it and shag it.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.586
How about a face tightener
for the road?

06:34.061 --> 06:40.868
*

06:41.869 --> 06:43.771
- You're down in the polls
as a direct result

06:43.804 --> 06:45.573
from this recent scandal.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.007
Have you considered
dropping out of the race

06:47.040 --> 06:48.108
for the sake of your family?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.910
- I appreciate your concern,

06:49.943 --> 06:52.212
but my family is doing
just fine.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.515
I've discussed this
with my husband,

06:54.548 --> 06:55.916
and he agrees.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.519
We cannot bow
to the gutter tactics

06:58.552 --> 06:59.920
of the Whittaker campaign.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.922
We must continue to fight
for the issues

07:01.955 --> 07:03.991
that the people
of New York care about.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.059
- And what about
your daughter Amelia?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.829
How does she feel?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.131
- She's working through this.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.534
We--

07:16.103 --> 07:17.638
- You ever wake up some days

07:17.671 --> 07:20.674
and realize you're just
a goddamn asshole?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.943
- My old man used to say...

07:22.976 --> 07:26.680
"If you always do
what you've always done...

07:26.714 --> 07:28.682
you'll always get
what you've always gotten."

07:28.716 --> 07:31.151
- He sounds
like an asshole too.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.488
- Yeah, but he got it right.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.956
Don't like who you are,

07:35.989 --> 07:38.659
do something different.

07:43.964 --> 07:49.603
*

07:53.974 --> 07:57.678
- So, she's just
basically sleeping?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.581
- Sort of.
But she's fine.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.921
- Yeah.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.623
She is.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.592
- She was kidnapped,

08:11.625 --> 08:15.629
and then...
you rescued her like me?

08:15.663 --> 08:20.100
- Yeah.
Like you.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.009
Bill.
- You said you'd call.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.911
- I'm sorry.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.548
- She's still sleeping,
but I think she's okay.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.816
- I'm coming over there.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.150
She needs to see
a familiar face

08:37.184 --> 08:38.819
when she wakes up.
Where are you?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.020
- No.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.689
No, give her a chance
to get her bearings.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.791
- I need to make
this right, Tess.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.026
- You have.
We found her with your help,

08:46.059 --> 08:47.628
and now she's safe.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.630
I'll call you back
when she's awake.

08:49.663 --> 08:56.870
*

09:02.175 --> 09:05.045
- Hey, what are you...

09:05.078 --> 09:06.780
Dad?

09:06.814 --> 09:07.915
What are you doing here?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.217
Mom says you're not
supposed to see me.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.020
- I know, I just...

09:13.053 --> 09:15.723
I just really needed to.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
I miss you, Peanut.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.093
- I miss you too.

09:27.134 --> 09:31.705
It's new.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.774
- I got you something.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.683
- Figured you're gonna need
a computer for NYU, right?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.785
I'm not...

09:44.818 --> 09:48.088
I'm not going to NYU, Dad.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.824
Mom didn't tell you?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.761
Well, what happened?
I thought--

09:53.794 --> 09:55.128
- The scholarship
didn't come through,

09:55.162 --> 09:58.398
and Mom says a loan
is out of the question.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.867
I'll be lucky if I can go

09:59.900 --> 10:01.902
to a community college
at this point.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.972
- Well, you earned
a spot there.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.139
You deserve it.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.143
I'm gonna call them.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.712
I'll talk to them.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.282
- It doesn't work like that,
Dad.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.384
- Well, let me see
what I can do.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.154
And I'm going to see about
getting our house back too.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.859
How's any of it gonna happen?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.861
I've been working.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.364
Really hard.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.001
- Consulting.

10:34.968 --> 10:39.740
- For some...important people.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.409
And I have a feeling that...

10:42.442 --> 10:46.113
they might be able to convince
NYU to have a change of heart.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.953
- You have my word
on it, Peanut.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.654
Come here.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.159
I love you.
- I love you too.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.427
- Okay.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.829
Have a good day at school,
Peanut.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.196
- Thanks, Dad.

11:12.172 --> 11:12.339
.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.113
- Yes.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.282
I got carried away
last night...

11:22.315 --> 11:25.018
celebrating
Whittaker's poll numbers.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.021
About Harding.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.790
- Politics is a contact sport.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.224
If you don't want
to get bruised,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.460
you shouldn't get
on the field, right?

11:33.493 --> 11:36.229
Now, my concerns about
the way you handled it were...

11:36.263 --> 11:38.065
purely tactical.

11:38.098 --> 11:42.736
And obviously, I was a fool
to question your judgment.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.205
Well,
I think you know

11:45.238 --> 11:48.809
I'm more of a shock
and awe kind of gal.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.178
We needed to take advantage
of Harding's gender.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.081
If she were a man,
none of this would matter.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.383
But this election's
only the beginning, huh?

11:56.416 --> 11:58.185
Who knows?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.519
Someday, we might be
pulling the strings

11:59.552 --> 12:01.454
of someone holding the keys
to the White House,

12:01.488 --> 12:03.123
and there will always be a
place on the team

12:03.156 --> 12:05.125
for someone with
your unique abilities.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.530
Well, I am a patriot.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.334
And full disclosure
about my "unique abilities":

12:14.367 --> 12:17.104
I've only showed you
the tip of the iceberg.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.272
- Good to know.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.110
As a matter of fact, I have
a new assignment for you.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.444
There are rumblings

12:24.477 --> 12:26.479
of a former Whittaker intern
planning to surface

12:26.513 --> 12:29.249
with sexual harassment
accusations.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.885
Well,
what convenient timing.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.322
Harding's people must have
put her up to it.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.091
We need to crush
this thing ASAP.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.160
- I'm glad to see
we're on the same page.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.561
I'm sure the little harlot's
bound to have

12:41.594 --> 12:44.865
some soiled lingerie
in her closet.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.868
- And you want me to find it.
- Exactly.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.870
That's all her pertinent
personal information.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.271
You'll need to work quickly.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.274
And, as always, success
will be rewarded handsomely.

12:54.307 --> 12:57.277
*

12:57.310 --> 12:58.578
- Consider it done.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.448
- Excellent.
Your car's out front.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.287
- Yeah, but Alex, hold on.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.357
Hold on.
You trust me, right?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.159
- Of course I trust you.
What kind of question is that?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.094
- Because I trust them.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.896
- Okay, I'll try not
to embarrass you

13:15.929 --> 13:17.530
in front of your friends.

13:17.564 --> 13:21.034
- That's me.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.437
Nice to meet you too.
- She's fired up about this.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.406
- I hadn't noticed.
- Can you confirm

13:26.439 --> 13:28.275
you have a kidnapping victim
in your custody

13:28.308 --> 13:30.310
and in this apartment?
- Yes,

13:30.343 --> 13:32.612
I can confirm that.
- You can't sequester

13:32.645 --> 13:34.581
a kidnapping victim
until you decide

13:34.614 --> 13:36.516
she's ready to talk
to a State's attorney.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.451
You want me to list everything
that's wrong with that?

13:38.485 --> 13:39.987
Should I start
with the legal things

13:40.020 --> 13:41.889
or the ethical things?
- Okay, relax, Alex.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.257
She's been heavily sedated.
We don't know for how long,

13:44.291 --> 13:47.027
and she can't make a statement
until she's fully coherent.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.228
- Yeah, and we're not convinced

13:48.261 --> 13:49.462
that putting her
on anyone's radar--

13:49.496 --> 13:51.131
authorities or not--
is a safe move.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.933
Her abilities made her
a commodity.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.068
But if the people that took her
get wind that she's willing

13:55.102 --> 13:57.104
to testify--
- If she's willing to testify.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.305
If.
- Yes.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.107
If she's willing to testify,

14:00.140 --> 14:02.642
then we might as well
paint a target on her back.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.914
*

14:06.947 --> 14:08.315
- Fine, but I want
to talk to her.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.582
- You will, just not yet.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.084
Like Taka said,
she's still unconscious.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.285
- When she wakes up,

14:12.319 --> 14:14.021
she's gonna be frightened
and confused.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.622
- She's been through a lot.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.191
And that's not even accounting
for what we saw in her dreams.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.526
- Hold up.
What you saw in her dreams?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.295
Does that mean he can do
the dream thing too?

14:22.329 --> 14:25.498
- Yeah.
Tess as well.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.437
- So we're just gonna
tell everyone now?

14:30.470 --> 14:33.941
- Seriously, am I the only one
who can't do this?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.052
- Brutus.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.286
Relax.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.522
Sorry.
You scared him.

14:49.556 --> 14:54.161
We don't allow pets
in here, Ms. Bennett.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.530
- It's been a while.
Well, I've been busy.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.600
- You locked me out
of your data bank, Bill.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.403
Your system says
my password expired.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.605
- Sure.
There's an automatic lockout

15:05.638 --> 15:07.340
after a certain period of time.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.542
It's been months since
you've expressed any interest

15:09.576 --> 15:11.378
in providing financing.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.414
The data's for investors,
which you are not.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.617
- Well, I am very eager
to open my checkbook...

15:17.650 --> 15:20.153
as long as you can provide
some evidence

15:20.187 --> 15:23.056
that these things
actually work.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.292
- Well, that's great news.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.027
- Good.
Then you'll...

15:27.060 --> 15:29.629
reactivate my password.
- Absolutely.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.431
As soon as I get
the system back up

15:31.464 --> 15:33.033
and a firm commitment
from you in writing.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.536
Tomorrow, then?
- Probably.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.572
- Let's say "definitely."

15:39.606 --> 15:42.175
Still in touch
with Lainie Whicker?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.710
- Lainie Whicker.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.245
You said you had
high hopes for her.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.579
- Oh!
Yes, Lainie.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.148
No, no.
She's gone.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.183
She disappeared.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.518
- Yeah, she just disappeared.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.453
She didn't leave
any contact information.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.588
Not even a good-bye note.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.292
- That's disappointing.
- It is.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.294
She had a lot of potential.

16:01.328 --> 16:04.031
- Hmm.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.598
- You know, we can't just
make a run at Bennett.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.766
We don't have enough.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.068
- And when the victim
wakes up--

16:08.101 --> 16:10.103
- Her name is Lainie.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.504
- When Lainie wakes up,

16:11.538 --> 16:13.540
we have no idea
what she's gonna remember,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.208
if anything.
- For now,

16:15.242 --> 16:16.709
we stick with the plan.
As soon as she's conscious

16:16.743 --> 16:18.611
and coherent, we get her
to a State's attorney

16:18.645 --> 16:20.513
we can trust.
- But we do it

16:20.547 --> 16:23.283
when she's ready.
Not a second before.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.484
- In the meantime,
we need to start

16:24.517 --> 16:26.253
fortifying our case
against Bennett,

16:26.286 --> 16:27.754
rattle some cages.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.389
And I think
we start with the one

16:29.422 --> 16:32.292
who's already shook up:
Nicholas Hull.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.196
- He runs a financial firm
Burton used to work for.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.665
- They were the ones brokering
the deal to sell my son.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.802
*

16:42.835 --> 16:43.936
- I did,

16:43.970 --> 16:46.606
only until I realized what
they had their hands into.

16:46.639 --> 16:50.777
I've been trying to burn
the place down ever since.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.247
- Listen, Taka and I are
putting our jobs on the line

16:54.281 --> 16:56.416
by not calling this
in right now.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.085
So, Taka, one of us
needs to be here

16:58.118 --> 16:59.819
when Lainie wakes up,
so I'm staying.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.123
- No.
Out of the question.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.824
- She's gonna be terrified

17:04.857 --> 17:07.360
when she wakes up.
I'll handle it.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
She knows me from her dreams.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.663
I'll tell you when
you can come back.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.566
- Okay, it's not up to you
if I'm here or not.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.402
She's a victim.
I'm a cop.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.170
She's my responsibility,

17:17.204 --> 17:18.471
and this is my case.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
- She's not a case.
She's a person.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.143
- We need to get her
on the record.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.577
We've wasted enough time.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.413
Who knows how long ago
she was taken

17:26.446 --> 17:27.680
and what happened to her?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.282
The kidnapping case
is cold enough as is.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.484
We can't even do a rape kit
on her at this point.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.524
- If this trafficking business
is real,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.692
statistically
there's a 60% chance

17:39.726 --> 17:42.195
she was about to be
or already was

17:42.229 --> 17:43.730
part of a sex ring.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.300
- That's not what this is.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.336
- No.
The only certainty

17:49.369 --> 17:50.837
is that Lainie is one of us

17:50.870 --> 17:52.839
and she was taken
against her will.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.142
- Look, Alex will hang back

17:55.175 --> 17:57.444
until you think it's okay
to talk to Lainie,

17:57.477 --> 18:01.114
but I think she should stay.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.515
- Okay.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.517
But no questions
till I say so...

18:04.551 --> 18:06.686
until she's ready.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.820
- No.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.658
- Alex, come on.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.565
- Fine.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.568
- Mom!

18:21.601 --> 18:24.137
- Mom, she's awake.

18:28.375 --> 18:34.214
*

18:48.528 --> 18:48.695
.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.664
- She's been getting fed
off an IV

18:51.698 --> 18:53.400
for who knows how long.
You have to take it slow.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.907
- Look at her nails--
the polish.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.710
That's gotta be at least
a month's growth.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.348
- I thought we agreed
you were gonna hang back.

19:08.381 --> 19:12.385
- We agreed no questions.
I'm making statements.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.323
- It's okay, Lainie.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.626
We're just trying to figure out
what happened to you.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.262
I just wanna get out of here.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.164
- I hear you,
but you need to rest.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.335
This is important.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.669
Try to think back
to when you were taken.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.639
What's--what's
the last thing you remember?

19:32.672 --> 19:34.374
- I don't know.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.944
I was alone, I think.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.879
A movie.
I was at a movie.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.248
- Okay.
- An old one.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.550
What movie?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.786
- The Quad Theaters.

19:46.819 --> 19:49.922
It was a foreign movie,
but it was in English.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.625
"The Last" something.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.627
- "The Last Wave."
Is that it?

19:54.661 --> 19:57.597
Yeah, I think so.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.667
- "The Last Wave" played at
the Quad almost six weeks ago.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.703
- That's impossible.

20:03.736 --> 20:07.274
It feels like it was just
a couple of days ago.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.409
Bill Boerg.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.345
- Bill Boerg.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.813
He must have something
to do with this.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.282
That guy's an asshole.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.517
I won't argue
with you on that.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.819
Anything's possible with Boerg,

20:19.852 --> 20:21.954
but he did help us find you.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.594
Of course he did.
He just wants me back

20:27.627 --> 20:30.697
in one of his stupid pods,
dreaming for him.

20:30.730 --> 20:37.737
*

20:39.839 --> 20:41.708
- You realize all we have
on Hull is hearsay

20:41.741 --> 20:43.976
and a check that came
from a shell corporation.

20:44.010 --> 20:48.047
- He doesn't know that,
nor does he need to.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.749
- Well, now you're thinking
like a cop.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.319
- If we're right about
his connection to Bennett,

20:52.352 --> 20:53.686
it won't matter anyway.
Chances are,

20:53.720 --> 20:56.456
Bennett will come after us
before the day's out.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.691
- Good.
I'll count on it.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.294
- ...Nothing to protect
themselves.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.662
- You're talking about
Whittaker?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.464
- I told you,
Whittaker is nothing.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.636
Can you give a name,
Doctor?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.071
- Taylor Bennett.
- How do you--

21:15.041 --> 21:17.310
- Well, first, let me just say,

21:17.344 --> 21:18.811
you've got a serious
set of stones

21:18.845 --> 21:20.347
coming here, Burton.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.582
- And yet, you let us in.
- I'm intrigued...

21:22.615 --> 21:26.619
to see what else you might use
to absolve yourself

21:26.653 --> 21:30.790
of whatever it is you need
to absolve yourself of.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.426
It worked so well last time
with the FBI.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.961
- I asked you a question,
Mr. Hull.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.896
I do not.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.899
- He used to work for you.
- Many people work for me.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.568
- This one ended up dead.

21:41.601 --> 21:45.505
I do have to admire
your tenacity, Burton.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.607
That's why I hired you
in the first place.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.010
- I admire your optimism,
misplaced as it is.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.912
- You know, I find it curious
that you wouldn't know

21:52.945 --> 21:55.047
about someone who received
as much compensation

21:55.081 --> 21:56.683
as Dr. Ralston did.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.786
You know, but then again,
perhaps our witness was

21:59.819 --> 22:01.654
mistaken when she connected you
with those payments--

22:01.688 --> 22:03.723
before she was abducted,
drugged,

22:03.756 --> 22:07.927
and unlawfully detained
by said doctor.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.465
- You might just consider
asking Taylor Bennett

22:12.499 --> 22:13.833
about this, Detective.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.403
It was her name I heard
on the recording, not mine.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.904
- True enough.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.939
But once that arrest warrant
issues on her for kidnapping,

22:19.972 --> 22:23.710
she'll start naming names
to chip years off her sentence.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.112
The early bird gets the deal,
Mr. Hull.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.814
The rest get hard time.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.082
- So, roll on Bennett
and you could spend your time

22:30.116 --> 22:32.652
at Club Fed rather than
Sing Sing.

22:39.492 --> 22:43.563
If you two think that
you have...what it takes

22:43.596 --> 22:46.032
to bring me down this time,

22:46.065 --> 22:49.502
please, be my guest.

22:49.536 --> 22:54.674
Until then, I have
a company to run, so...

23:02.849 --> 23:04.884
*

23:08.020 --> 23:09.756
- I'm still nauseous.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.591
- It'll pass.
It's probably the drugs.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.959
I'll leave it here.

23:15.828 --> 23:20.032
Earlier?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.734
- James.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.804
- I feel like I saw him
in a dream once.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.473
- It's possible.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.975
- I know I saw you
and that other guy.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.177
- Burton.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.617
You found me, right?
At Evallyse?

23:37.650 --> 23:40.152
My castle.
Evallyse.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.888
- That's right.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.891
That's how we found you
in the real world too.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.593
- So you're dreamers.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.762
We are.

23:49.796 --> 23:52.064
- No.
- I didn't think so.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.901
Why do you keep staring at me?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.636
- You're kind of the star
of the show here, kid.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.137
I'm just making sure
you're okay,

23:58.170 --> 23:59.806
that you're safe.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.043
Is there anyone
I can call for you?

24:04.076 --> 24:05.244
- No.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.580
Your parents?

24:07.614 --> 24:08.915
- I don't have any family...

24:08.948 --> 24:10.917
at least, none I want
to go back to.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.556
- We should try
and shake anything else out

24:16.589 --> 24:18.825
you can remember.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.060
Maybe the people
who abducted you.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.929
How many there were,
or what they looked like.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.898
- How do I even know
you're really a cop?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.536
Would that help?

24:29.569 --> 24:31.103
- You guys could be the people
who kidnapped me

24:31.137 --> 24:33.239
for all I know.

24:33.272 --> 24:34.674
- Lainie, we rescued you

24:34.707 --> 24:36.543
because we wanted
to protect you.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.210
That's all.
- Then I'm free to go.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.712
- Of course you're free to go.

24:39.746 --> 24:44.684
But...I hope you don't.
You can help us

24:44.717 --> 24:46.185
get the people
who did this to you,

24:46.218 --> 24:49.288
and--and maybe stop them
from doing it to someone else.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.894
- I know how you feel.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.829
*

24:56.863 --> 25:02.134
What you've been through
is...inhuman.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.937
We've been through a lot too,
my son and I.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.675
That's why we all care so much
about what happens to you.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.610
Maybe we're special
because of what we can do,

25:10.643 --> 25:12.579
but we're still people.

25:12.612 --> 25:17.016
We're not property
to be bought and sold.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.985
No one is.

25:19.018 --> 25:22.321
We need your help
to make these bastards pay.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.224
We don't have to be victims.

25:25.257 --> 25:32.064
*

25:32.098 --> 25:35.034
- What happened after
you left Bill Boerg's place?

25:37.203 --> 25:40.940
- I was so stupid.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.576
Some guy--he didn't
tell me his name.

25:43.610 --> 25:46.345
I didn't ask.
I didn't care--

25:46.378 --> 25:48.815
handed me $25,000 in cash

25:48.848 --> 25:51.283
and offered me another $250,000

25:51.317 --> 25:52.685
just to go overseas
for a few months

25:52.719 --> 25:54.220
and dream with some sheikh
or something.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.756
I said yes.
I mean, who wouldn't?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.024
I moved out of my apartment.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.694
I donated all my crap.
I was all set to go.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.796
- It's the perfect plan.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.765
They let you make it look
like you packed up and moved,

26:05.798 --> 26:07.934
then they took you.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.903
- Okay.
Your turn.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.371
- You said that

26:12.404 --> 26:13.773
you and your boy
had been through a lot,

26:13.806 --> 26:17.209
that we're the same,
that you understand.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.345
They stole my life.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.380
Weeks gone.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.183
God only knows
what they did to me.

26:24.216 --> 26:27.687
So tell me, what's so terrible
that happened to you?

26:31.090 --> 26:38.064
*

26:42.969 --> 26:45.672
Tess.

26:47.139 --> 26:50.342
- I think I know
why they kidnapped her...

26:50.376 --> 26:51.878
why they drugged her.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.381
- I'm sorry, Lainie.
I'll be back.

26:55.414 --> 26:58.250
I'm sorry.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.819
Tess!

27:02.154 --> 27:02.689
.

27:02.722 --> 27:03.489
- I feel like I'm back
in the Stone Age.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.437
Who's this?
- It's Bill.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.972
We've got a problem.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.974
Taylor Bennett
just came to my office.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.712
- Well, she wanted to know

27:25.745 --> 27:27.446
if I'd been in touch
with Lainie Whicker.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.215
- I handled it.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.818
I said that I hadn't
been in touch with her

27:31.851 --> 27:33.285
and I had no idea
where she'd went.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.089
- Maybe, but if
she suspects anything,

27:37.123 --> 27:38.958
then we could be in danger,
especially Lainie.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.860
- If she suspected something,

27:40.893 --> 27:42.128
we wouldn't be talking
right now.

27:42.161 --> 27:44.163
- Yeah, I'd try to stay awake
if I was you.

27:44.196 --> 27:47.366
- You don't think she'd send
that Shadow guy after me?

27:47.399 --> 27:49.936
- Just put on a pot of coffee
and we'll be there.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.138
- Okay, I'll never sleep again.
That sounds like a great plan.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.373
Listen...

27:54.406 --> 27:56.042
take care of Lainie.

27:56.075 --> 27:56.743
Okay?
Protect her.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.778
That is what matters right now.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.180
- We will.
Talk to you soon.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.054
- So Bennett's been
sniffing around Boerg.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.889
- Asking questions
about Lainie.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.457
She was one of Bill's
test subjects.

28:11.490 --> 28:12.859
- It makes sense that Bennett's

28:12.892 --> 28:14.326
been pushing him
for information.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.128
- Yeah, but what if there's
more to it than that?

28:16.162 --> 28:19.732
- What, do you think
he's hiding something?

28:19.766 --> 28:22.168
- Bill's always
hiding something.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.471
*

28:28.074 --> 28:29.508
- Tess, what the hell
is going on?

28:29.541 --> 28:30.977
Where did you go?

28:31.010 --> 28:33.179
- I'll tell you.
Just give me a moment.

28:37.283 --> 28:40.252
Hey.
How are you feeling?

28:40.286 --> 28:43.856
- Better.

28:43.890 --> 28:47.760
- Not really

28:47.794 --> 28:49.762
- You're starting
to freak me out, lady.

28:49.796 --> 28:52.098
- Okay.
You said "God only knows

28:52.131 --> 28:54.500
what they did" to you.
And we don't know.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.903
But we have to find out.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.138
So...I don't know
how else to say it,

28:59.171 --> 29:02.308
so I'm just gonna...

29:02.341 --> 29:04.043
I think you're pregnant.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.046
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.316
- I don't know why I didn't
think about this before.

29:10.349 --> 29:14.921
A dreamer,
the lost time,

29:14.954 --> 29:18.457
your nausea,
and the fact that, uh...

29:18.490 --> 29:22.328
the fact that
this happened to me...

29:22.361 --> 29:25.397
eight years ago.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.935
- I lost an entire
year of my life,

29:28.968 --> 29:31.804
every bit of it
gone from my memory,

29:31.838 --> 29:35.975
except...this one thing.

29:36.008 --> 29:40.079
This thing that kept me
from giving up on everything.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.215
This vague, almost
unseeable image

29:43.249 --> 29:45.852
of...my boy.

29:45.885 --> 29:49.956
*

29:49.989 --> 29:52.258
This is crazy.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.531
- I don't want this to be true,
but we need to know.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.847
- So, what's the game plan,
Taylor?

30:14.881 --> 30:16.248
Nicky, we don't need

30:16.282 --> 30:18.217
a game plan.
Everything's under control.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.086
- I was the one
who was unceremoniously

30:20.119 --> 30:21.954
marched out of his office
in handcuffs

30:21.988 --> 30:23.555
not too long ago,
if you recall.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.924
- And yet, there you are,

30:24.957 --> 30:26.392
back in
your cozy little office.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.294
They obviously have no
prosecutable evidence on you.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.862
- Well, it seems
like they know

30:29.896 --> 30:31.030
a lot more than
they're saying,

30:31.063 --> 30:32.464
especially about
your connection

30:32.498 --> 30:34.200
to us and our mutual interests.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.468
- A recording without
corroboration

30:36.502 --> 30:38.070
is nothing more than gossip.

30:38.104 --> 30:40.139
There are layers and layers
separating my name

30:40.172 --> 30:43.142
from all of this.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.044
There are, right?

30:46.578 --> 30:49.081
- Of course.

30:49.115 --> 30:53.119
- Then it's still
just our little secret.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.570
- When I first got
my detective badge,

31:11.603 --> 31:14.506
I was assigned
to a sex crimes unit.

31:14.540 --> 31:18.110
Spent two years before I...

31:18.144 --> 31:21.447
couldn't take it anymore.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.584
You don't expect it, you know?
You think, "Crime is crime."

31:25.617 --> 31:30.089
You steel yourself against it.
You've been trained for it.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.558
But the women I saw...

31:32.591 --> 31:35.661
abused and raped and forgotten.

31:38.097 --> 31:43.435
Most of them just...
bury the pain and the horror

31:43.469 --> 31:47.940
deep insides themselves,
but it...never goes away.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.476
It's always there,
right under the surface,

31:50.509 --> 31:55.347
just...waiting to explode.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.217
That's why I went
into homicide.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.652
I realized, sometimes
the dead got it made.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.024

32:05.057 --> 32:07.326
- If this test is positive...

32:07.359 --> 32:09.495
whoever we saved her from,
they'll never stop looking

32:09.528 --> 32:13.365
for her until
they find that baby.

32:13.399 --> 32:14.967
- Not if I can help it.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.604
*

32:21.407 --> 32:23.375
We finally agree on something.

further comment on this today,

33:05.251 --> 33:06.352

33:06.385 --> 33:09.255

Thank you.

everything, don't you?

33:53.199 --> 33:56.435

Mr. Dolan?

33:56.468 --> 33:59.738
- Well, it's just that
she got accepted into NYU.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.573
- Congratulations.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.642
Yes,
but unfortunately,

34:03.675 --> 34:05.577
the scholarship
she was expecting

34:05.611 --> 34:07.713
did not materialize.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.650
I realize that
it's a long shot, but...

34:11.683 --> 34:14.186
I was hoping you might have
a way to persuade

34:14.220 --> 34:16.188

to reconsider

34:16.222 --> 34:18.290

about my daughter.

to please management,

34:37.509 --> 34:40.479
- So you'll consider it,
at least?

36:28.787 --> 36:30.889
- POTUS is in the house.

36:30.922 --> 36:32.858
- * Simply irresistible

36:37.596 --> 36:39.631
- * Simply irresistible
- * She's so fine

36:39.665 --> 36:42.768
* There's no telling
where the money went *

36:44.670 --> 36:46.372
- * Simply irresistible
- * She's all mine

36:46.405 --> 36:49.641
* There's no other way to go

36:49.675 --> 36:52.311
*

36:52.344 --> 36:53.979
* Simply irresistible

36:56.948 --> 36:57.449
.

37:00.018 --> 37:03.922
*

37:03.955 --> 37:06.392
- You did good work today.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.528
- Thanks.
You too.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.298
- We're gonna get
this Taylor Bennett.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.866
We're close.
I can feel it.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.668
And she's gonna lead us
right to the asshole

37:16.702 --> 37:18.036
who did this to you and Sabine

37:18.069 --> 37:19.805
and your mother.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.644
Where are you going?

37:25.677 --> 37:27.379
The precinct's the other way.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.448
- Nah, you're sleeping
at my place tonight.

37:29.481 --> 37:30.782
I'll take the couch.

37:30.816 --> 37:34.286
I already told you, Taka.
This isn't your problem.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.554
Besides, Christy's gonna
get all--

37:35.587 --> 37:38.524
- We already talked to her.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.792
- Wait, you told her
I was gonna sleep

37:40.826 --> 37:43.629
at your apartment
because I'm afraid my dreams

37:43.662 --> 37:45.664
will be invaded by a madman?

37:45.697 --> 37:48.334
- No, I told her we had
an all-night stakeout

37:48.367 --> 37:50.869
and that I owed her a big one.
I'm not a complete idiot.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.004
- Taka--
- Listen.

37:53.038 --> 37:54.840
We're partners, so that means

37:54.873 --> 37:57.543
your problems are my problems,
whether you like it or not.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.445
You're gonna get
a good night's rest,

37:59.478 --> 38:00.779
and I'm gonna be there.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.349
No one's getting into
your dreams tonight.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.686
- Great.
Our first sleepover.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.056
I can't wait for
the pillow fight.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.760
Idiot.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.576
James okay?
- Yeah.

38:30.609 --> 38:33.912
He's out cold,
snoring like a little bear.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.950
Thanks for letting him
sleep in your room.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.786
- Of course.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.655
You should try getting
some sleep yourself.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.892
I tried.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.963
Didn't take.

38:54.633 --> 38:58.804
Tess?
Talk to me.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.006
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

39:01.039 --> 39:04.643
It's okay.
What is it?

39:04.676 --> 39:09.481
*

39:09.515 --> 39:13.819
- You know, all this time,
I've been...

39:13.852 --> 39:16.422
I've been like a mad dog
looking for James,

39:16.455 --> 39:20.926
and...
Thinking I was crazy.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.994
And then
when I finally found him,

39:23.028 --> 39:26.998
it all became about...

39:27.032 --> 39:28.667
making up for lost times

39:28.700 --> 39:34.005
and then...building him
the life he deserves.

39:34.039 --> 39:37.543
But now, with Lainie,

39:37.576 --> 39:41.947
I realize there's
a lot I don't know.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.516
And I've been convincing myself
it didn't matter,

39:44.550 --> 39:46.885
but...

39:49.888 --> 39:53.492
What happened to me?

39:53.525 --> 39:55.627
Why can't I remember any of it?

39:55.661 --> 40:00.966
*

40:00.999 --> 40:04.002
- Listen to me.

40:04.035 --> 40:07.706
I'll help you.
Okay?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.908
You don't have to
do this alone.

40:11.643 --> 40:15.113
Let's find out
what happened to you.

40:15.146 --> 40:20.552
*

40:20.586 --> 40:23.789
[crowd chattering,
siren blaring distantly]

40:30.796 --> 40:33.532
- Oh, a goddamn mess

40:33.565 --> 40:34.600
is what happened.

40:34.633 --> 40:38.103
Guy took a nose dive.

40:40.806 --> 40:43.074
- So what am I
doing here?

40:43.108 --> 40:44.776
- Eh, we're peeling
the onion already,

40:44.810 --> 40:47.479
and guess whose name
was on the sign-in sheet

40:47.513 --> 40:49.114
at his office yesterday?

40:51.216 --> 40:53.118
You wanna tell me
why this guy had the pleasure

40:53.151 --> 40:54.786
of your company 18 hours ago?

40:57.889 --> 40:59.625
- It's all finished up
down here?

40:59.658 --> 41:00.726
- Yeah, I got to get a few
more shots, and...

41:03.762 --> 41:06.598
*

41:06.632 --> 41:08.734
- Dad.
- Hi, Peanut.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.201
- You're not going
to believe it.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.538
I just got an email from NYU.

41:12.571 --> 41:15.073
The scholarship people,
they said they made a mistake.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.207
I got it.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.544
A full ride!
I'm going to NYU!

41:18.577 --> 41:21.079
- That's so wonderful, Peanut.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.549
I'm so proud of you.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.150
I love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

41:25.183 --> 41:32.591
