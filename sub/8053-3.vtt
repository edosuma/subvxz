WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.334
Okay, now, see, here's a good example
of a plant that you can't eat.

00:04.404 --> 00:05.564
See all the spikes?

00:05.638 --> 00:08.766
So, two things. One, it's poisonous.
And two, it would hurt.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.969
<i>LESLIE: The Parks Department</i>
<i>has so many programs.</i>

00:11.044 --> 00:13.410
Jerry's in charge of our
pre-teen nature hikes.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.074
For a while, it was
a teenage nature hike,

00:16.149 --> 00:19.312
but then we changed it
because a girl got pregnant.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.956
Look what we have here,
country honeysuckle, Pawnee-style.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.389
Yeah, take a look at that.
Wow.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.948
It's pretty
and it smells good.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.016
Mmm. Smells great.

00:28.094 --> 00:30.028
Yeah, it's really nice.
Mmm.

00:30.663 --> 00:32.790
(EXCLAIMING IN DISGUST)

00:33.266 --> 00:34.858
That's bitter.
Leslie, you don't eat it.

00:34.934 --> 00:35.958
Oh! Why did you
let me eat that?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.060
I never told you
to eat that.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.161
Oh! God.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.206
Leslie, the animals know you
don't eat the country honeysuckle.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.797
I'm not an animal.
My tongue is swelling up.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.342
No, don't touch it!
No, you can't...

00:43.410 --> 00:44.968
Okay, now you'll have to
throw that away.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.273
LESLIE: Let's not scare the kids.
JERRY: Okay.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.904
All right. All right.
Well, there we go then.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.039
Let's see
what else is here.

00:49.115 --> 00:51.083
So let's tell them what other
plants we can eat, Jerry.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.382
But I have to say,
there's a very sweet aftertaste though.

<i>LESLIE: So I have</i>
<i>a piece of good news.</i>

01:27.954 --> 01:30.047
I've invited a reporter
to come do an article

01:30.123 --> 01:32.182
about the pit
behind your house.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.782
She writes for
the <i>Pawnee Journal,</i>

01:33.860 --> 01:36.988
which is kind of like our
town's <i>Washington Post.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:40.357
ANN: That sounds
really good.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.061
Thank you, Ann.
It is a classic strategy.

01:43.136 --> 01:47.004
The press is a weapon and you can use
it to kill people or to feed people.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.405
You know, the beginning of
projects are very vulnerable,

01:49.476 --> 01:51.239
and you have to make sure
that you get a lot of press,

01:51.311 --> 01:55.247
'cause the momentum of that can kind
of keep it alive, or else it'll die.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.045
I mean, I'm sure you remember the
Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.713
The Tucker Park Graffiti
Removal Project was a great idea

02:01.788 --> 02:03.619
that just
ran out of steam.

02:03.690 --> 02:07.091
<i>We had removed five cartoon penises,</i>
<i>not even 10%,</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:09.822
<i>when we were shut down</i>
<i>due to lack of funding.</i>

02:09.895 --> 02:13.297
To this day, I am haunted
by those remaining penises.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.197
One penis in particular.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.397
Now, when the reporter
gets here,

02:19.472 --> 02:21.963
it is vital that
we all follow my rules

02:22.041 --> 02:23.406
about how to deal
with the media.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.207
Rule number one,
stay on message. This is key.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.882
All we need to talk about is the pit,

02:30.950 --> 02:33.145
and the fact that we're
gonna turn it into a park.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.447
And that's it. Okay?

02:34.521 --> 02:35.715
Number two...

02:35.788 --> 02:37.983
What?
Stay on message again?

02:38.057 --> 02:40.150
Yes, it's that important.

02:40.226 --> 02:43.593
It's one and two. Stay on message
and stay on message. Right?

02:43.663 --> 02:45.062
Stay on what, Ann?

02:45.131 --> 02:46.223
Message.
Great.

02:46.299 --> 02:49.700
<i>ANN: Leslie formed a committee</i>
<i>to fill the pit in a week,</i>

02:50.436 --> 02:52.563
which is really impressive.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.039
I mean, until now,
my only experience with government

02:55.108 --> 02:57.576
was trying to get
a recycling bin.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.036
Wait. Did I ever get it?

03:00.113 --> 03:02.013
Bye, Leslie.
LESLIE: Bye, Ann.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.446
Hey, Mark?

03:04.517 --> 03:05.916
Yeah.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.911
Buy you a cup of coffee?

03:10.523 --> 03:15.790
This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial
meeting place of Pawnee's political elite.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.131
<i>The people who eat here</i>
<i>basically run this town.</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:21.133
So, listen, I was hoping
maybe I could pick your brain

03:21.201 --> 03:24.034
about how to deal with the media.
It's my first interview.

03:24.103 --> 03:26.901
What about that thing you did for the
middle school newspaper last year?

03:26.973 --> 03:30.136
Oh. No. I don't count that.
That was a smear job.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.870
So I put together some discussion
topics. Can I run them by you?

03:35.081 --> 03:36.275
Okay.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.874
What do you think her
opening gambit is gonna be?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.977
What is she
gonna ask me first?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.419
How you spell your name.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.819
Of course.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.585
Because of the silent "K."

03:45.658 --> 03:47.319
(CHUCKLING) You're so smart.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.361
Okay, now should I give her
a tour of the building...

03:49.429 --> 03:51.488
How many discussion
questions do you have there?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.589
Um... Thirty.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.065
Wow!

03:55.134 --> 03:56.601
You're insane.

03:56.669 --> 03:58.193
You're insane.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.434
(LAUGHING)

04:01.507 --> 04:05.568
Mark and I made love once.
And it was very intense.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.848
Hi, I'm looking
for Leslie Knope.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.012
Okay.
LESLIE: Oh!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.384
My ears are ringing. Hi.
Hi.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.853
I'm Leslie Knope.
Hi.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.891
I'm the deputy director
of Parks and Recreation.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.152
Shauna.
Malwae-Tweep.

04:20.226 --> 04:22.057
Yes, I am familiar
with your work.

04:22.128 --> 04:23.618
I've read everything
you've ever written.

04:23.696 --> 04:27.655
You did an amazing in-depth article
on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.

04:27.734 --> 04:29.133
(EXCLAIMS)

04:29.202 --> 04:33.400
Who left the door open?
No! No! No!

04:33.740 --> 04:37.141
And I agree with you.
They are nature's bandits.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.770
Thanks.
I was happy with that line.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.671
So, can I give you a quick
tour before we get started?

04:42.749 --> 04:45.274
I've been here before.
A few times.

04:46.319 --> 04:48.219
Quick tour?
Okay.

04:48.755 --> 04:51.553
So there are 10 murals
here in this hallway.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.424
And this is called "The
trial of Chief Wamapo."

04:55.495 --> 04:58.794
It was painted in 1936
and this is Chief Wamapo

04:58.865 --> 05:02.198
and he was convicted of crimes
against the soldiers.

05:02.268 --> 05:07.228
I am always amazed
at his quiet dignity

05:09.075 --> 05:11.305
right before he's killed
by a cannonball.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.004
SHAUNA: I'm surprised no
one's complained about this.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.842
Oh, tons of
people have.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.711
Yeah, we get
letters every day.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.216
This is Ron Swanson,
our boss.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.751
Ron, this is the reporter
I was telling you about.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.343
No comment.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.479
About what?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.715
Hey, Haverford,

05:23.790 --> 05:26.554
maybe one day you'll figure out
how to spell a three-letter word.

05:26.626 --> 05:27.957
(SIGHS) Come on, Ron.

05:28.027 --> 05:30.894
I play a lot of online Scrabble
with my boss, Ron Swanson,

05:30.963 --> 05:32.590
and, oh, my God,

05:33.099 --> 05:35.067
<i>that guy is the best.</i>

05:35.635 --> 05:38.229
<i>He beats me every time.</i>
<i>He kills me. He's awesome.</i>

05:38.304 --> 05:40.329
I can't beat him.
I should just close my account.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.873
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

05:42.709 --> 05:44.199
Well, Shauna,
this is our crack team.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.301
Hi, everyone.

05:45.378 --> 05:49.542
Tom Haverford, boy genius.
Smooth like milk chocolate.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.173
That's a weird way
to describe me.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.979
April Ludgate, 19.

05:53.052 --> 05:56.283
Cool enough to be invited
anywhere and chooses to be here.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.621
And finally,
we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.489
They're the real heroes
of this story.

06:01.561 --> 06:04.029
Ann was the citizen who brought
the pit to our attention.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.362
And Andy is the
citizen who fell in it.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.664
Great. It's cool
if I record this, right?

06:13.139 --> 06:17.405
Yeah. Good.
That way it's verbatim.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.935
So, Leslie,
you're in charge of the committee.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.548
I'm sorry. It's actually called a
subcommittee, not a committee, so.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.615
We can do
all this on tape.

06:31.691 --> 06:33.716
Right. Sorry.
Sure we can.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.023
And this is where
you meet, generally?

06:39.098 --> 06:40.224
Really?

06:40.299 --> 06:43.791
We meet at a bunch of different places.
We don't always meet here.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.599
So I didn't quite know
how to answer that.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.834
Okay, why don't I ask the rest
of your team some questions

06:48.908 --> 06:50.205
and then we will come back to you later?

06:50.276 --> 06:51.504
Okay, great.
That's a good idea.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.445
Because these are the real heroes.
I'm gonna be in my office.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.421
So, Andy, tell me about the
night you fell into the pit.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.458
Oh. Yeah.
That's actually a great story.

07:06.526 --> 07:10.053
I just finished up a gig
with my band Three Skin,

07:10.129 --> 07:13.656
formerly Four Skin, but our
bassist left for personal reasons.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.200
And I was taking
a shortcut home,

07:15.268 --> 07:18.294
and I thought I saw a
toaster lying in the pit.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.839
And I was like,
"Maybe I should get that."

07:21.541 --> 07:23.805
And I fell in
and broke my legs.

07:23.876 --> 07:24.934
Such a tragedy.

07:25.011 --> 07:27.502
Why would you want a toaster that's
lying at the bottom of the pit?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.571
I don't know.
I was pretty wasted.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.241
Wait. You were drunk?

07:31.317 --> 07:33.148
Oh, yeah. Totally.

07:33.219 --> 07:34.811
You knew that.
I didn't know that, no.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.651
You should've told me, because we
gave you anesthesia at the hospital.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.089
I was probably not thinking
'cause I had two broken femurs

07:40.159 --> 07:41.456
and I was
blackout drunk.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.188
Andy, I just...
I can't believe

07:43.262 --> 07:44.889
I'm just finding
this out right now.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.330
Like you're perfect. You're on the pill.
You drink all the time.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.095
ANN: You're allowed to do that.
Stay on message.

07:49.168 --> 07:53.036
Thank you so much for bringing
that up in front of a reporter.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.509
ANN: Leslie, it's not
that bad, right?

07:57.577 --> 08:00.808
I mean, why don't we just go back
in there and talk about the park?

08:00.880 --> 08:04.338
Oh, Ann.
You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.

08:05.084 --> 08:10.021
The press are like sharks, and you guys
just dumped a bucket of chum in the water.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.215
Hey, I just got
your 15 texts.

08:13.292 --> 08:14.316
LESLIE: Mark.

08:14.393 --> 08:18.386
Listen, thank you
for coming.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.159
I tried to stay on message.
Mmm-hmm.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.531
But then, Ann and Andy
sandbagged me.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.502
Andy was drunk
when he fell in the pit.

08:24.570 --> 08:28.131
And it turns out that Ann
is on birth-control pills.

08:28.207 --> 08:29.196
MARK: Okay.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.537
Shauna is in
the conference room,

08:30.610 --> 08:33.738
and she's writing a really bad
article and it's gonna destroy us all.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.371
Please fix it.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.750
April, let me
ask you something.

08:39.885 --> 08:44.118
Do you think I'm in the top five
best-Iooking Indian guys in Pawnee?

08:44.222 --> 08:45.622
No.
Who do you think's got me beat?

08:45.691 --> 08:46.919
That guy Hashish
at City Planning?

08:46.993 --> 08:48.483
Tommy boy.

08:48.561 --> 08:51.257
Let me tell you something, Tom.
You suck at Scrabble.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.729
I know.
You're destroying me.

08:52.798 --> 08:56.165
You're worse than my ex-wife,
and she's terrible at Scrabble.

08:56.235 --> 08:57.497
And she's a bitch.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.128
Look out, man.
I'm gonna get you one of these days.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.832
I'm practicing.
Yeah, I doubt that.

09:00.907 --> 09:04.240
Her name is Tammy Swanson
and she's a serious bitch.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.768
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:06.846 --> 09:08.939
Hey, Leslie.
I have to go.

09:09.015 --> 09:12.314
Let's do the interview
tomorrow morning at the pit.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.910
Yeah. Perfect.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.921
Great.
I'll have a photographer meet us there.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.320
Okay. Great.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.653
See you then.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.555
Disaster averted.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.027
SHAUNA:
That was easy, right?

09:24.096 --> 09:25.529
MARK: Yeah?
SHAUNA: Can we go in your car?

09:25.598 --> 09:26.997
Absolutely.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.624
All right.
'Cause I hate driving.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.734
LESLIE: There's a beautiful
view from over there.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.466
This is a great place to take a shot.
Over there as well, so...

09:34.540 --> 09:36.337
(CAR HORN HONKING) MICHAEL:
I think you're fine.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.646
Hi!

09:45.718 --> 09:47.242
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.378
Oh, no problem.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.512
(CHUCKLES)

09:50.222 --> 09:52.019
Do you live near Mark?

09:52.091 --> 09:53.786
No, not at all.

09:55.061 --> 09:57.086
So he gave you
a ride somehow?

09:57.163 --> 09:58.528
Yeah.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.559
You know, do you have a pen?
'Cause I don't...

10:01.634 --> 10:03.101
No, sorry.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.466
Michael, do you have
any paper I could borrow?

10:04.537 --> 10:05.561
MICHAEL:
I might, yeah.

10:05.638 --> 10:06.662
I don't mean
to complain,

10:06.739 --> 10:09.435
but I think Shauna is being
a little unprofessional.

10:09.508 --> 10:11.669
She got here
15 minutes late.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.269
She's wearing the same
dress she wore yesterday.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.781
And she had to
get a ride from...

10:24.557 --> 10:26.752
So how big
is this lot?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.354
Leslie, how big is...
What?

10:31.430 --> 10:33.125
How big is the lot? The lot?
How big is what?

10:33.199 --> 10:36.293
I don't know. You tell me.
How big is the lot?

10:36.602 --> 10:39.867
A hundred or something.
Give or take 100. I don't know.

10:39.939 --> 10:40.963
A hundred what?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.132
I don't know,
Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.371
(CHUCKLES) I don't know. I don't...
I guess I don't know anything.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.105
Are you okay?

10:47.179 --> 10:49.272
I have to get something
from my car.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.196
What are you doing?

11:07.266 --> 11:08.563
Kicking Ron's butt
at Scrabble.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.659
I just played "lexicons"
for a billion points.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.533
No, no, no, no, no.
What?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.698
I was letting him win,
dumbass.

11:14.774 --> 11:15.798
Whatever.

11:15.875 --> 11:21.245
Oh. Come on.
"Lateral, communal, zonal"?

11:21.313 --> 11:24.908
You dropped a "Z"
in there? April.

11:25.217 --> 11:28.243
So when did you start
at the Parks Department?

11:28.954 --> 11:31.149
Well, it was
a few years ago.

11:31.223 --> 11:33.487
My mother
got me the job.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.722
I was qualified.
It's not like it was nepotism.

11:36.796 --> 11:41.495
Crap on a stick.
Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.125
But... Oh, my God.
No, it wasn't.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.226
Sorry.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.498
It's not you.
I just... I'm exhausted.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.938
I got, like,
zero sleep last night. So...

11:49.608 --> 11:50.632
(SIGHS)

11:50.710 --> 11:52.041
(RINGING DOORBELL)

11:58.050 --> 11:59.039
Oh.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.908
Hey, Leslie.
Hey! You're home.

12:00.986 --> 12:02.214
Yeah, I'm home.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.155
I was doing an interview at the pit,
and it was going really well.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.555
In fact,
it was going perfect.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.286
But I decided to leave
in the middle of it

12:08.360 --> 12:11.659
'cause I figured I nailed
it so why push it, right?

12:11.731 --> 12:12.789
Yeah.
Can I come in?

12:12.865 --> 12:13.923
Sure, yeah.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.591
Great.
Come on in.

12:17.002 --> 12:20.335
So how'd it go? She didn't ask
about Andy being drunk, did she?

12:20.406 --> 12:23.898
Oh. No. No, just your kind
of standard questions.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.878
There was
one annoying thing.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.107
She and Mark had sex
with each other.

12:29.715 --> 12:30.704
You're kidding.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.343
I wish I was,
but I'm not. They did it.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.354
Shauna Malwae-Tweep
and Mark Brendanawicz

12:36.422 --> 12:38.049
had sex with each other
last night.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.182
ANDY: Who had sex?

12:39.258 --> 12:41.317
That guy Mark
and the reporter.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.691
Called it.
I called that.

12:44.463 --> 12:45.691
You remember that?
Yeah.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.926
He did, actually.
He totally called that.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.627
Why do men have to
behave like this?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.294
Why can't they
be professionals?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.564
ANDY: Men are dogs.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.799
(SIGHS) You know,
maybe they really like each other.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.775
He doesn't like her.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.936
He was probably thinking
with the head of his wiener

13:00.012 --> 13:01.172
instead of
the head of his brain.

13:01.247 --> 13:02.908
Oh. God.
Andy, come on.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.280
Men do that.
It's disgusting.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.683
Well, I should
go talk to him.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.887
Make sure that he didn't say
anything to hurt the project.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.015
Yeah. Definitely,
you should talk to him.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.424
Yeah.
Good idea, Ann.

13:15.528 --> 13:16.893
I bet he didn't
use a condom.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.327
Andy, God!

13:20.132 --> 13:21.497
<i>LESLIE: Hello, Mark.</i>
<i>May I come into your office?</i>

13:21.567 --> 13:23.535
<i>I need to speak with you about</i>
<i>something very sensitive.</i>

13:23.602 --> 13:26.127
Something's come to my attention
that requires your attention.

13:26.205 --> 13:30.539
It has come to my attention that
you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.133
That's personal.

13:32.211 --> 13:35.908
It's unethical and it's irresponsible
for a public servant to have sex

13:35.981 --> 13:37.573
with a member
of the press corps.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.811
Especially when you have sex
with someone who is so skanky.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.285
I mean, have sex
with her and...

13:43.355 --> 13:47.223
I'm gonna say something. I don't
want you to take it the wrong way.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.557
But you're being
a huge dork.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.631
Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior
from someone serving on my subcommittee.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.638
Well, then I resign
from your subcommittee.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.212

14:10.216 --> 14:11.274
<i>Shauna Malwae-Tweep.</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:13.181
Hi, this is deputy director
of Parks and Recreation...

14:13.252 --> 14:15.083
<i>Leslie? Hi.</i>
Yes, hi.

14:15.955 --> 14:19.118
I accidentally
ate an old burrito.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.522
<i>What?</i>

14:21.293 --> 14:23.921
I was acting strange
at the pit

14:23.996 --> 14:27.454
and the reason is because
I had food poisoning

14:28.234 --> 14:30.065
from an old burrito.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.830
So, I was hoping we could
have a do-over interview.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.638
Maybe over lunch.
I'm buying.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.908
<i>Yeah, I guess I'm free.</i>
<i>I'm assuming not Mexican.</i>

14:43.148 --> 14:44.706
Why?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.408
<i>Because of the burrito.</i>

14:46.485 --> 14:48.248
(LAUGHING) Oh!

14:48.320 --> 14:51.187
Yeah, well, it wasn't
a Mexican burrito.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.383
Are you sure that's the best
thing for you right now?

14:55.461 --> 14:57.827
Oh, it's the best thing
on the menu.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.297
So, look, I feel
like I may have

15:00.432 --> 15:02.366
gone a little off message
at the pit.

15:02.434 --> 15:03.492
Yeah, you seemed
a little weird.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.558
Well, I wouldn't say weird.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.629
It's just,
we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore

15:07.706 --> 15:10.174
into a beautiful
community park

15:10.442 --> 15:14.606
and a positive article could go a
long way towards making that happen.

15:14.680 --> 15:15.669
Great.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.980
So what do you think the odds are that
this park is actually gonna get made?

15:20.052 --> 15:24.546
Can I say over 100%?
Because I would be lying if I said less.

15:24.623 --> 15:28.525
Wow. You seem a lot more confident than
some of the other people I've spoken to.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.528
Can I read you
some of these quotes?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.120
Be my guest.

15:32.197 --> 15:36.463
"The Sullivan Street pit
is always going to be a pit."

15:36.535 --> 15:39.766
Well, until it
turns into a park.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.499
Yes, I agree.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.877
"Hey, you should write
an article on unicorns,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.140
"because they're more likely
to exist than this park."

15:48.213 --> 15:51.307
Oh, really?
Tell that to a 14-year-old girl.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.374
"You should write an article
on the Pope getting married,

15:53.452 --> 15:56.046
"because that's more likely
to happen than this park."

15:56.121 --> 15:58.214
There are some countries
where the Pope can be married.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.224
"You should write an article
on talking monkeys."

16:00.292 --> 16:01.418
Really? Have you seen
<i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

16:01.493 --> 16:03.427
"You should write an article
about leprechauns."

16:03.495 --> 16:04.587
Leprechauns exist.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.427
"You should write an article about
the sun falling out of the sky."

16:07.499 --> 16:09.694
Why would you write an
article about that? That's...

16:09.768 --> 16:11.668
This one is just "No."

16:13.472 --> 16:17.841
"This park is never, ever, ever,
ever going to happen."

16:20.913 --> 16:22.437
Might I ask
who said that?

16:22.514 --> 16:24.209
Mark Brendanawicz.

16:28.754 --> 16:29.778
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

16:29.855 --> 16:31.220
Yeah.
Hey.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.646
Hi.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.249
Can I talk to you
for a second?

16:34.326 --> 16:35.816
Yeah, what's up?

16:35.894 --> 16:39.990
You and I need to find a way
to fix this reporter thing.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.466
Why is this a big deal
to anybody?

16:42.534 --> 16:46.937
Well, apparently, the reporter is
gonna print everything you said to her.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.167
But I didn't say
anything to her.

16:49.241 --> 16:52.870
"The park is never, ever, ever,
ever getting built?"

16:55.014 --> 16:56.572
But that stuff
was off the record.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.275
Did you say
it was off the record?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.374
Do you have to say
it's off the record?

16:59.451 --> 17:00.440
Oh, God.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.346
(DOOR OPENING)

17:05.991 --> 17:08.425
Hey. Thank you so much
for meeting us.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.722
Sure.

17:09.795 --> 17:10.989
Hey, Mark.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.462
Hey.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.656
Uh...

17:14.266 --> 17:15.858
I heard that you were gonna
print some of that stuff

17:15.934 --> 17:17.992
that I said in private
about the park.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.095
Oh, yeah.
My editor loves it.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.703
You know, we'd really appreciate
it if you didn't print that stuff

17:23.776 --> 17:24.765
'cause we're trying
to build this park...

17:24.843 --> 17:25.935
I don't understand.

17:26.011 --> 17:28.172
You did say it, right?

17:28.247 --> 17:29.475
Technically.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.015
Technically?

17:31.083 --> 17:33.244
Well, you know,

17:33.318 --> 17:35.684
you got up because you had to
write the article and I said,

17:35.754 --> 17:37.745
"Come on,
stay in bed.

17:37.823 --> 17:40.690
"That park is never, ever,
ever gonna get made."

17:40.759 --> 17:43.227
Right. And then
I came back to bed.

17:43.295 --> 17:47.026
Yeah, but the important part of
what I said was, "Stay in bed."

17:47.099 --> 17:49.533
You know,
I would've said anything at that point

17:49.601 --> 17:51.330
if I thought it would
make you stay in bed.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.700
(CHUCKLES)

17:52.771 --> 17:56.070
Okay, well, since we're,
you know, romantically involved,

17:56.141 --> 17:57.574
I won't print any of it.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.543
That's great. Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

17:59.611 --> 18:03.513
You know, I wouldn't say
romantically involved.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.675

going forward.

Ron Swanson.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.424
Tom.

18:22.167 --> 18:26.263
Ron, I don't know what to tell you, man.
April got on my computer.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.034
Password was saved.
She played a couple of Scrabble words.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.370
It wasn't me.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.670
I don't even know
what lexicons are.

I thought that was
a luxury automobile.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.346
You're the word king.
She was probably cheating.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.212
I knew that
couldn't have been you.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.910
You don't have
the vocabulary.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.009
I know.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.951
You can't even
spell vocabulary.

Was that right? No.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.397
We're cool.

18:54.433 --> 18:58.233
I'm not an idiot. I know Tom has
been losing to me on purpose.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.861
But I like Tom.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.133
He doesn't do a lot
of work around here.

19:02.207 --> 19:05.438
He shows zero initiative.
He's not a team player.

19:05.511 --> 19:08.446
He's never one
to go that extra mile.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.677
Tom is exactly what I'm looking
for in a government employee.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.723
Well, I'm writing

19:19.791 --> 19:21.850

for the <i>Pawnee Journal,</i>

19:21.927 --> 19:24.054
so, yeah,
I'm a little busy.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.294
I wanted to
apologize to you.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.300
Really?

19:30.369 --> 19:31.563
Yeah.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.437
I never should've done
anything with that reporter.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.378
Whoa! You nailed
Malwae-Tweep? Nice.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.381
Yes, but I'm not
gonna do it again.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.248
It's over.
TOM: So she's available.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.346
I really did think that that stuff
that I said was off the record.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.756
But you were right,
and I should've listened to you.

19:55.093 --> 19:58.893
I tried to get her to pull some of those
quotes and things got a little dicey.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.296
Well, I appreciate
you trying.

20:03.302 --> 20:06.760
Would you like to be reinstated
onto our subcommittee?

20:07.873 --> 20:09.067
Absolutely.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.336
You'll have my answer
within the month.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.536
Mark, can I ask
you a question?

20:13.612 --> 20:15.239
You didn't really
believe it when you said

20:15.314 --> 20:18.249
that the park was never
gonna get made, right?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.450
Park's gonna get done.

20:21.119 --> 20:24.418
Welcome back,
subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.420
Thanks.
Thank you.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.586
Thank you.
Thank you.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.027
Thanks, a lot.
Thank you a lot.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.121
(CHUCKLES)

20:33.198 --> 20:36.861
Man, that dude has stuck
it in some crazy chicks.

20:40.572 --> 20:45.168
<i>LESLIE: Well, the article came out,</i>
<i>and it was a mixed bag.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:46.711
<i>"An abandoned lot</i>
<i>on Sullivan Street</i>

20:46.778 --> 20:48.837
<i>"has been proposed</i>
<i>as the site of a new park."</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:51.212
That part's good. I think we
stayed on message for that part.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.774
And then it gets
a little unpleasant.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.286
"Pretty drunk,
Ann's on the pill."

20:56.788 --> 20:58.312
I didn't "throw up,"
I spit up.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.857
JJ's Diner
gets a nice mention.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.984
Oh, and right here.
At the end.

21:02.060 --> 21:05.621
She writes, and I quote,
"We'll see."

21:08.200 --> 21:09.827
Ends on a hopeful note.

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
