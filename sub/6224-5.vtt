00:02.753 --> 00:05.995
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.173 --> 00:11.213
The destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.386 --> 00:15.220
His name: Merlin.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.268
Woman: Osgar...

01:14.741 --> 01:17.278
You know what must be done.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.817
I do.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.986
Stand.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.159
Take it

01:31.466 --> 01:35.334
the fate of Arthur pendragon
is in your hands now.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.589
See that you honor it.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.252
You're getting good, mordred. Very good.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.050
- My lord.
- I may have to start trying soon.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.586
My lord.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.225
Always remember...

03:13.443 --> 03:17.152
Did you see how mordred used a contre quarte to
my high-line attack? It was skillfully done.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.603
- Really?
- You understand what a contre quarte is, right?

03:19.741 --> 03:22.403
I'd guess it's a type of parry
beginning in the quarter position...

03:22.577 --> 03:24.067
Ending with a twist of the wrist.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.328
You have been paying attention.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.868
What do you think of young mordred?

03:31.586 --> 03:33.497
He's, uh, making progress.

03:33.672 --> 03:37.130
He has all the makings of a fine knight.
Don't you think?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.507
There are many fine knights in Camelot.

03:39.678 --> 03:43.671
Yes, but if I'm not mistaken,
he'll be one of the finest.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.808
And I'm determined he will receive
nothing but encouragement from me.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.803
You think he's not ready?

03:51.982 --> 03:53.813
It's not that.
He's an excellent swordsman.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.690
You think he's too young.
Too headstrong.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.483
He's always been
thoughtful and modest.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.819
Well, he sounds perfect, Merlin.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.322
I can't ignore what I saw.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.653
Mordred is destined
to play a part in Arthur's death.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.991
Perhaps. Perhaps not. The future
has many paths. That is only one.

04:09.166 --> 04:12.579
Have you ever seen him show anything
but kindness towards Arthur?

04:12.753 --> 04:15.335
- No, but...
- If mordred wished Arthur ill

04:15.505 --> 04:17.666
nhe's had ample opportunity to do so.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.923
He's a likable boy, Merlin.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.086
I know. I like him myself.
But I can't ignore what I saw.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.381
Seeing is not the same as knowing.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.143
And we must know for certain.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.849
Before we act.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.239
What news from the east, sir Leon?

04:49.080 --> 04:52.493
Serious news I'm afraid, sire.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.451
As you know, a few days ago
our Garrison in the forest of breckfire...

04:56.630 --> 04:59.372
Intercepted the man
who goes by the name of osgar.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.131
The sorcerer. Leon: The same.

05:02.886 --> 05:07.004
They were trying to apprehend him
when he used his powers to escape.

05:07.182 --> 05:11.846
I'm sorry to report sir ranulf
was mortally wounded.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.185
Sir ranulf?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.638
He was a loyal and true knight.

05:18.151 --> 05:22.110
Place all the men in the eastern
territories on high alert.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.861
Yes, sir.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.867
I personally shall lead a patrol
to bring this osgar to justice.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.250
Is it necessary for you to go in person?

05:38.922 --> 05:40.642
A king must lead
or what's the point of him?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.758
You led the men when you saved
mithian's father and I nearly lost you.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.468
Sir ranulf's death cannot go unpunished.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.722
You have many fine men to avenge him.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.635
He wasn't just a knight, Guinevere.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.773
He was a friend.
We knew each other as boys.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.730
I must go.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.230
Have no fear.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.070
I'll be perfectly safe.
As you say, I have many fine knights.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.033
- Yes?
- You wish to see me, sire?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.698
Ah, mordred. Come in. Come in.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.703
The time has come for you
to accompany your king.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.715
- My lord?
- I want you to join me on a patrol...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.797
To white mountain.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.261
Me?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.012
- To breckfire?
- Congratulations.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.887
- This is a great honor. I...
Arthur: You've earned your place.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.140
- Be ready to ride at dawn.
- I shall be, my lord.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.527
You won't regret this.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.782
I promise.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.281
He has all the makings
of an excellent knight.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.979
I do believe you've grown fond of him.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.247
It's one of those things I do.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.793
Gwaine: You sure you haven't
forgotten anything, mordred?

07:09.971 --> 07:11.962
- Do you think so?
- Isn't he missing a dagger?

07:13.642 --> 07:15.348
I can't see a water bottle

07:15.518 --> 07:18.806
his boot. He's missing a boot, I think.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.148
You sure this is a good idea?

07:29.199 --> 07:31.110
He's a good fighter, a brave knight.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.701
He's very young.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.487
Where would any of us be, Merlin,
if no one had given us a chance?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.952
(Gentlemen.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.084
Merlin?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.917
You will take care of him?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.797
- Doesn't always make it easy.
- I know.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.386
Arthur: Merlin?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.412
Leon: It is a tradition.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.415
Elyan: Goes back years.
- We all had to do it on our first patrol.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.625
Mordred, what on earth are you doing?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.546
Melding the saddle, my lord.

08:28.717 --> 08:31.129
As in the ancient tradition of melding.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.465
Ah, of course.
I trust your breeches are on inside-out.

08:36.099 --> 08:37.099
My lord?

08:52.741 --> 08:55.232
It's osgar. He's close.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.488
He's getting careless.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.325
Sire.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.887
Who are you? What's your purpose?

10:03.228 --> 10:07.096
I was beginning to fear
you had taken the wrong path.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.015
- Who are you?
Osgar: My name is osgar.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.568
And I have an important message
for your king.

10:13.738 --> 10:17.447
- Take me to him.
- It'll be our pleasure.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.700
Do you not know who I am?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.782
You are a sorcerer, a
heretic and a murderer.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.908
No just a man who values his freedom.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.212
Take me to your king.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.631
Would you challenge me?

11:13.882 --> 11:14.997
Stop!

11:16.509 --> 11:18.124
Sire.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.677
- My name is osgar.
- I know who you are.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.638
I am sent from the sacred disir
to pass judgment on Arthur pendragon...

11:27.812 --> 11:30.599
The once and future king.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.513
What right have you to pass judgment?

11:33.276 --> 11:36.063
No man is above the disir, however royal.

11:39.199 --> 11:43.693
It is my duty to pass
their judgment onto you, dread king.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.527
My sacred duty.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.086
Your hand, Arthur pendragon.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.359
It is done.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.109
What is the meaning of this?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.991
It is both judgment and fate.

12:25.703 --> 12:29.491
You have waged war
on the people of the old religion.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.907
Now the ancient gods answer youl.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.243
The disir have spoken.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.917
The circle of fate begins to close.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.837
For even as Camelot flowers

12:42.011 --> 12:44.297
the seeds of her destruction
are being sown.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.967
What nonsense is this?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.390
It is not too late, Arthur.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.107
Not too late to find the true path.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.353
Redeem yourself.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.702
No further chance shall be given.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.190
What would the king say?

13:41.195 --> 13:43.937
Sorcerers are not permitted
marked graves.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.449
It's all right, Merlin.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.027
I'd have done the same.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.198
He was one of us, after all.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.423
It won't always be like this.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.961
One day we'll live in freedom again.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.092
- You really believe that”?
- I do.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.891
Until then.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.353
We go unmarked in death as in life.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.205
- Swelling should go down by morning.
- Let's hope so.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.542
How is he?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.753
I've applied poultices.
They'll make a full recovery.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.344
You're a skilled physician, Merlin.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.840
Watched Gaius, that's all.

14:54.310 --> 14:58.349
He also makes a very fine breakfast
as you'll soon discover, eh, Merlin?

15:00.149 --> 15:02.481
- Now I've offended him.
- Heh

15:02.652 --> 15:05.234
Arthur:
Come, Merlin. Warm yourself. Have a drink.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.569
To young mordred
on his first successful mission.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.326
- It was nothing.
- It was timely and vigilant.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.330
- Merlin?
- Congratulations.

15:19.210 --> 15:23.169
If he died and was granted eternal happiness, I
do believe he'd find reason to be miserable.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.414
Come, Merlin. We've triumphed.

15:30.012 --> 15:31.968
Osgar could have easily killed you.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.262
- He didn't, did he?
- But he was a sorcerer.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.677
It was quite within his power.

15:38.855 --> 15:39.970
He was deranged.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.519
The rune Mark.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.148
A trinket. Nothing more. Here.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.734
I'll have the jeweler mount it
383 memento of our success

16:03.921 --> 16:07.254
- Are you feeling all right, Merlin?
- Quite, my lord.

16:07.425 --> 16:11.338
I think more and more I find your face
resembles the back end of a cat

16:11.512 --> 16:13.798
see, you don't even laugh
at my jokes anymore. Seriously.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.808
I haven't seen you smile
these past three days.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.970
I'm not sure there's
a great deal to smile about.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.196
Sire, thank you for coming.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.576
Please.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.114
Don't tell me Merlin's got you
believing his nonsense too, Gaius.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.659
This is a rune Mark, my lord.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.748
That's what everyone keeps telling me.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.960
In times past,
this Mark aroused great fear.

16:50.134 --> 16:54.878
It was given to those found wanting
by the court of the disir.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.296
The disir?

16:56.474 --> 16:58.465
The highest court of the old religion.

16:59.310 --> 17:03.724
Three women were chosen at birth
to be trained as seers and soothsayers.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.560
Their only task was to interpret
the word of the triple goddess.

17:08.152 --> 17:12.486
When they sat in judgment,
their word was final.

17:12.656 --> 17:16.194
All this worn-out superstition
has no relevance now.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.951
I don't see what bearing
it has on me or Camelot.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.952
Because, sire...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.785
The disir have seen
fit to give you this.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.666
This is the judgment
of the gods against you.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.547
This is nonsense, surely.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.924
The old religion held that the rune Mark
not only contained the man's guilt...

17:41.102 --> 17:43.263
But the path that the gods
have chosen for him.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.265
That is why it is both a judgment and fate.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.852
I make my own path.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.062
Do you?

17:53.823 --> 17:56.735
It is said that only the gods
can alter a man's fate.

17:57.994 --> 18:02.863
And even then, only when he repents
and appeases them.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.791
You don't believe any of this?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.210
(Gaius?

18:21.350 --> 18:23.136
I'm an old man, sire.

18:23.311 --> 18:27.645
Old enough to be wary of dismissing
other people's beliefs.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.036
Have I not made Camelot
a fairer and more just kingdom?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.286
You have, my lord.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.950
Have I not rid it of the cruelties
and injustices of the past?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.790
- You have.
- I am not my father.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.204
No

18:53.382 --> 18:56.840
- Then why do they judge me so?
- I'm not sure I'm the person to ask.

18:57.011 --> 19:00.720
I am asking you, Merlin.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.305
Man to man.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.346
Well, perhaps I feel you're worthy enough
to be judged.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.227
What do you mean by that?

19:12.401 --> 19:16.144
Judgment is wasted on a man
who won't listen.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.855
You think I should take them seriously?

19:22.119 --> 19:24.110
I think you already have.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.540
If there's nothing else...

19:33.172 --> 19:34.787
No, thank you.

19:54.777 --> 19:58.315
You were right to summon me, Merlin.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.323
The disir are the mouthpiece
of the triple goddess.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.994
It is she who has decreed Arthur's fate.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.495
What is it to be?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.625
The rune Mark predicts Arthur's death.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.706
When?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.290
When will Arthur die?

20:19.552 --> 20:23.545
The future is never clear, Merlin.
You should know that by now.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.380
There are many paths.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.971
Not all lead to Camelot's ruin.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.478
- Do they lead to mordred?
- The druid boy?

20:32.815 --> 20:37.434
His fate and Arthur's are bound together
like Ivy around a tree.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.979
I fear he is dangerous.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.154
There is good cause to doubt him.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.237
Is there nothing I can do?

20:46.412 --> 20:49.074
Sometimes to save the tree.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.039
The Ivy must be cut.

20:53.836 --> 20:56.953
You had a chance to kill
the druid boy once before.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.463
If you have another...

20:59.633 --> 21:01.715
You must not fail.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.188
Gwen: Arthur?

21:21.947 --> 21:24.484
I thought you might be hungry.
You ate nothing at supper.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.698
Thank you.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.700
That's kind.

21:28.871 --> 21:32.113
He was a deranged, desperate man.
You said so yourself.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.579
Merlin was right.
He could have killed me

21:35.753 --> 21:38.369
but instead he thought it was
more important to give me this.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.540
And he gave his life doing so.

21:42.468 --> 21:47.337
- Who can fathom the mind of a fanatic?
- It wasn't what was in his eyes, Guinevere.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.132
There was no hatred there.
It was something else.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.470
Pity almost.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.141
Why would a sorcerer pity a king?

21:57.775 --> 21:59.982
Come. Eat something.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.231
What if the disir are right?
What if I have transgressed in some way?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.612
What if I've put Camelot in danger?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.819
Arthur, you are a good and just king.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.910
The disir don't seem to think so.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.823
That is because
they don't know you like I do.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.872
If they did, they would
feel nothing but love.

22:27.096 --> 22:31.089
- Is it late? Have I overslept?
Gaius: Not yet dawn.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.472
My lord?
“Where can I find the disir?

22:35.646 --> 22:36.681
Sire, I...

22:36.856 --> 22:39.097
Gaius, if anyone knows
where to find them, it's you.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.687
Until yesterday,
I didn't know they still existed.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.438
They do as we know.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.193
So again...

22:45.364 --> 22:47.229
Where can I find them?

22:47.408 --> 22:49.194
Sire, I do not think it is wise for...

22:49.368 --> 22:52.576
Gaius. Do I look like a man to trifle with?

22:55.666 --> 22:59.409
It is said that the disir divine
using an ancient pool.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.537
In turn, the pool is fed...

23:02.715 --> 23:05.502
By the sacred spring at calandry.

23:07.094 --> 23:11.758
The source of the spring is a grove
of yew trees in the white mountains.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.172
The grove at breneved.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.135
Thank you.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.142
We leave within the hour.

23:23.027 --> 23:26.269
Be careful, Merlin.
I don't know what you'll encounter.

23:26.447 --> 23:30.816
But the old ways will be
at their strongest there.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.577
The calandry is at the very center
of their powers.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.873
Mordred: My lord. You are going
to the white mountains?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.257
Arthur: I am.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.509
Then I humbly petition to come with you.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.510
This is not for novices, mordred.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.801
Did I not serve you well?

23:55.976 --> 23:57.512
You did.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.926
Then I will do again.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.811
There's no mere sorcerer
this time, mordred.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.893
Our mission is dangerous...

24:04.068 --> 24:05.854
In ways we cannot perhaps imagine.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.440
Then you will need good men by your side.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.487
Let me serve. Let me do my duty.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.205
Arthur: Merlin?

24:20.376 --> 24:23.083
See to it he has everything he needs.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.221
Stay close. Know your positions.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.683
- My lord.
- What is it, Merlin?

25:25.858 --> 25:29.066
- This place is sacred.
Arthur: It's a cave, Merlin.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.442
Merlin: It's more than that

25:30.612 --> 25:32.443
any one cave is the same as any other.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.526
You can't go armed into a sacred place.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.076
You want us to go in there unarmed?

25:43.459 --> 25:46.292
Of all the ridiculous things
that you've ever said, Merlin...

25:46.462 --> 25:47.998
There's been a few.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.788
That's the most ridiculous. By far.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.125
I am Arthur pendragon...

26:36.303 --> 26:38.385
King of Camelot.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.512
I've come to know the meaning of this.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.933
Grove of breneved is
in the kingdom of Camelot...

26:52.111 --> 26:55.228
Subject to its laws, its decrees.

26:55.405 --> 26:59.819
Every man, however humble,
however noble

26:59.993 --> 27:01.913
has the right to be
judged only by his peers.

27:02.037 --> 27:06.747
Yet you judge me in my absence.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.748
Explain yourselves.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.661
We do not judge.
“We do not condemn.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.252
Disir 3: We are but the internuncio
of the one who presides over all.

27:15.425 --> 27:18.417
Who sees all. “Who knows all.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.131
All: The triple goddess.

27:20.305 --> 27:24.674
And you, Arthur pendragon,
have angered her.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.389
How so?

27:27.563 --> 27:29.724
Have I not been an honorable king?

27:30.732 --> 27:33.098
Have I not made Camelot a fair
and just kingdom?

27:33.277 --> 27:34.483
Disir 1: So much is true.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.645
But you have denied the old religion.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.563
Disir 3: Dismissed its faith.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.277
Persecuted its followers.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.658
Even unto slaughter.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.070
I fight against sorcery.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.613
Superstition, that's all.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.783
Disir 2: Embrace the ways
of the old religion, Arthur.

27:50.961 --> 27:53.293
Or risk the ire of the goddess.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.580
Disir 2: The destruction
of everything you most value.

27:56.758 --> 28:00.216
- The end of your reign.
- The fall of Camelot itself.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.720
I refuse to be judged
by those who do not know me.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.382
Disir 3: You are known, Arthur.
You have always been known.

28:10.731 --> 28:15.851
And now you come here
to the most sacred of the sacred.

28:16.028 --> 28:20.237
To the very heart of the old religion.
With weapons drawn.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.863
Trampling hallowed relics.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.117
Treating our sacred space
like you do your kingdom.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.198
With arrogance. “With conceit.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.953
With insolence.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.332
Enough! You speak of the king.

28:37.841 --> 28:38.921
On me!

28:46.642 --> 28:47.642
Merlin!

28:52.814 --> 28:54.054
Fall back!

29:17.297 --> 29:18.457
How is he?

29:21.218 --> 29:23.379
It's not a simple wound.
Sorcery's involved.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.259
Is there anything you can do?

29:31.561 --> 29:34.098
This is beyond my skills, sire.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.977
We need to get him back to Camelot.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.711
That's a long and arduous journey.
What if he doesn't survive it?

29:40.821 --> 29:44.655
Look, I fear that Gaius
is the only one that can save him.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.194
Mount up. We ride for Camelot.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.764
He grows worse.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.979
There has been little change.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.983
I should have never let him come.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.233
He wanted to prove himself.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.897
Arthur: And he has.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.684
He saved my life for the second time.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.433
Merlin is right.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.568
This is no ordinary wound.

31:05.739 --> 31:07.275
There is magic at play.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.280
Can you save him?

31:09.451 --> 31:12.488
I'm but a physician.
There are limits to my knowledge.

31:13.622 --> 31:17.114
- But there must be something that can be done.
- Perhaps.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.783
I shall do everything in my power, sire.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.547
Arthur:
Let me know the moment he improves.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.013
Or

31:36.436 --> 31:37.471
I shall.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.647
Only your magic can save him, Merlin.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.408
I cannot save the life of a man
destined to kill Arthur.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.539
If mordred is destined to
take the king's life...

31:59.709 --> 32:01.620
Why has he just saved it?

32:03.338 --> 32:05.704
I cannot ignore what the dragon said.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.713
What happened to the young boy
who came into my chambers...

32:10.887 --> 32:12.047
Just a few years ago?

32:15.350 --> 32:16.965
He grew up.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.429
And he learned the meaning of duty.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.783
It's not your fault.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.284
He begged you to let him go.
It was a kindness to allow...

32:39.458 --> 32:41.039
It was foolishness. No.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.745
You told me once

32:42.919 --> 32:45.706
that mordred had a strong sense of duty.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.167
- That's true.
- You also told me that he was impetuous.

32:48.341 --> 32:50.502
- I should have listened to you.
- No, you shouldn't.

32:51.845 --> 32:55.087
If mordred hadn't gone,
it could be you in Gaius's chambers.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.048
Mordred did his duty so you could do yours.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.765
To be king.

33:05.859 --> 33:07.065
Yes?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.855
- Sire.
- Is there any news?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.746
I thought that once we got him
back to Camelot, in your care...

33:21.917 --> 33:25.751
Gaius: The staff that caused the wound
was forged using powerful sorcery.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.316
- All the same...
- The poison that runs through his veins...

33:28.340 --> 33:29.876
Is beyond remedy.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.424
There must be

33:34.429 --> 33:35.669
something you can do.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.133
I'm afraid not.

33:38.308 --> 33:42.517
Only the disir themselves have the power
to counteract their own sorcery.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.764
I'm afraid we must prepare ourselves
for the worst

33:50.320 --> 33:51.560
I'll go to them.

33:52.572 --> 33:55.063
- Sire, I do not think that...
- And beg for mercy.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.405
Prepare the horses. We leave at once.

34:22.310 --> 34:26.849
- Why do you risk so much for one man?
- I'd do the same for any knight.

34:27.023 --> 34:30.139
Though obviously not me.

34:30.318 --> 34:31.853
Actually, I would.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.152
Servants are hard to come by,
even the bad ones.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.938
I'm touched.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.818
Mordred saved my life.
What greater debt can there be?

34:41.705 --> 34:43.320
A debt to your people.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.864
To your destiny.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.283
You almost sound as if you care.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.826
I do care.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.791
About who you are, Arthur.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.206
- Who you are destined to become.
- It's fated

34:54.384 --> 34:56.279
it doesn't matter what I do.
It'll still happen.

34:56.303 --> 35:00.342
- There's a difference between fate and destiny.
- You think too much, Merlin.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.678
The situation's quite simple.
A brother in arms saves my life.

35:03.852 --> 35:07.561
When he in turn is threatened,
it's my duty to do all I can to save him.

35:40.597 --> 35:43.054
I'm not totally insensitive, Merlin.

35:43.224 --> 35:46.136
I can see that some people feel
that this is a sacred place.

35:46.311 --> 35:49.474
I'm even prepared to admit
that you're right sometimes.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.560
Obviously I'll deny ever saying that.

35:53.735 --> 35:55.271
Obviously.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.831
Disir 1: Arthur pendragon.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.493
- King of Camelot.
- We have been expecting you.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.258
My men and I behaved
with arrogance and stupidity.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.424
We dishonored this place
and insulted your faith.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.771
And I humbly beg your forgiveness.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.733
One amongst us...

36:36.903 --> 36:38.859
Sir mordred

36:40.115 --> 36:42.731
may vet pay the ultimate price.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.150
I've come here to petition
you for his life.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.990
Why should we help you?

36:48.164 --> 36:50.164
Arthur: I ask not for myself
but for a young man...

36:50.333 --> 36:53.575
Whose only crime was
to sacrifice himself for his king.

36:53.753 --> 36:57.621
The future holds much pain and suffering
for you, Arthur pendragon.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.664
Disir 1:
For you and your people.

36:59.843 --> 37:03.085
Disir 2:
If you wish to save all you hold dear.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.379
If you wish to save your kingdom.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.218
Embrace the old religion.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.634
- Learn her ways.
- Bow to the goddess.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.728
You know I can't do that.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.895
Disir 1: Consider carefully.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.940
You have until dawn.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.207
How did you know this place was sacred?

37:39.674 --> 37:41.255
That's obvious.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.500
Pretend it isn't.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.466
Everything here...

37:47.640 --> 37:49.176
So full of life

37:50.602 --> 37:53.685
every tree. Every leaf.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.895
Every insect.

37:56.065 --> 38:00.183
It's as if the world is vibrating.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.862
As if everything is much more than itself.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.449
You feel all that?

38:09.245 --> 38:10.576
Don't you?

38:27.764 --> 38:29.220
What will you do?

38:32.977 --> 38:34.308
I don't know.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.977
My heart says do anything I can
to save mordred.

38:41.694 --> 38:45.653
But I've seen what misery
unfettered sorcery brings.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.325
Before my father outlawed magic...

38:50.495 --> 38:53.908
Camelot was almost destroyed by sorcery.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.789
In my own time, morgana's used it
for nothing but evil.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.204
What would you do?

39:04.092 --> 39:06.253
- In my place?
- Me?

39:08.263 --> 39:10.595
I'm just a lackey, maker of beds.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.596
Lackeys can be wise.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.858
It's not like you to be silent.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.314
The kingdom's future is at stake.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.980
And a man's life

39:30.827 --> 39:32.987
you must protect Camelot.
You must protect the world...

39:33.121 --> 39:34.736
You spent your life building.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.030
A just and fair kingdom for all.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.709
You'd have me sacrifice a friend?

39:45.842 --> 39:48.333
I would have you become the king
you're destined to be.

39:49.846 --> 39:53.805
If I do save mordred,
all my father's work will be for nothing.

39:53.975 --> 39:57.763
Sorcery will reign once more in Camelot.
Is that what you'd want?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.357
Perhaps my father was wrong.

40:05.528 --> 40:07.689
Perhaps the old ways aren't as evil
as we thought.

40:11.409 --> 40:12.990
So, what should we do?

40:14.037 --> 40:15.243
Accept magic?

40:16.956 --> 40:18.912
Or let mordred die?

40:38.686 --> 40:41.723
There can be no place for magic in Camelot.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.676
Disir 1: You have returned.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.463
Is your decision made?

41:17.642 --> 41:19.803
It is

41:23.064 --> 41:25.225
I cannot do as you ask.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.483
Consider carefully, Arthur pendragon.

41:29.654 --> 41:34.273
This is your last chance
to save all that is dear to you.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.157
Disir 3: It will not come again.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.996
I've seen too much...

41:42.166 --> 41:44.452
To allow sorcery again within Camelot.

41:44.627 --> 41:45.912
You have made your decision.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.874
- Sealed your fate.
- And that of your kingdom.

41:50.675 --> 41:54.338
All: Farewell. Arthur pendragon.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.445
Merlin: You did the right thing.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.482
I condemned a man to death.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.155
For the sake of Camelot.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.455
He saved my life, Merlin.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.120
More than once.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.077
I know.

43:19.514 --> 43:22.381
Merlin:
How could I have been so stupid?

43:23.601 --> 43:25.011
You did what you thought was best.

43:25.186 --> 43:28.053
I assumed the best way to protect Arthur
was to kill mordred.

43:28.981 --> 43:31.188
A perfectly natural assumption.

43:31.359 --> 43:35.648
But all I did was make sure he lived.
That was the disir's judgment.

43:35.822 --> 43:39.531
Mordred's life is Arthur's punishment
for rejecting magic.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.113
You mustn't blame yourself.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.118
But it is my fault.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.954
Mordred is alive and well.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.244
He's free to play his
part in Arthur's death...

43:52.421 --> 43:54.878
And there's nothing I
can do to prevent it.

43:58.803 --> 44:00.134
Merlin: Nothing.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.849
Where is she?

44:16.237 --> 44:17.757
I thought we could play a little game.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.207
Whatever twisted game you're playing...

44:31.377 --> 44:33.083
I want no part in it.
