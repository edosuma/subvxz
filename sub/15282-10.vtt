00:03.600 --> 00:05.100
I'm Asking You Out,
Garcia.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.100
Hey, Garcia.

00:06.100 --> 00:08.200
I've Been Thinking About
Doing This All Night.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.500
I Just Need You To Run
Some Bar Association Records.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.400
Why Doesn't She Do It?

00:14.400 --> 00:15.700
She's In The Hospital.

00:15.700 --> 00:16.600
Whoa. This Might Be

00:16.600 --> 00:18.500
The Coolest
Girl I've Ever Met.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.600
Her Gooey Is Mind-blOwing.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.700
I'm Not Going Anywhere.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.500
This Couch Right Here Is
Gonna Be My Best Friend

00:24.500 --> 00:26.700
Until We Find This Guy.
Now Leave It Alone.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.500
Ok.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.000
Kevin Lynch.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.400

00:31.900 --> 00:32.700

No One Sees
True Night...

01:04.099 --> 01:05.700
What's Really There
In The Dark

01:08.900 --> 01:10.300
It's Not That
They <I>Can't</I> See,

01:10.800 --> 01:12.000
They Simply Don't.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.100
They Feel
An Elemental Force

01:16.100 --> 01:19.300
That Scares Them Into The Deepest Reaches
Of Their Minds...

01:21.900 --> 01:24.700
But They Refuse To See
The Actual Source...

01:26.300 --> 01:29.500
Something Wane Them,
Just Out Of Their Reach.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.900
Something Cold
And Frightening.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.400
Something Inhuman.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.800
These Are Victims 6 And 7
Within A 2-Week Span.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.300
All Killed With
A Bladed Weapon?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.000
Yeah.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.900
The Attacks Are Getting
Progressively Worse.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.400
The First 5
Were Lone Victims.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
He's Getting Bolder.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.600
And More Vicious.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.500

What The Hell?

04:20.700 --> 04:21.700
What?

04:21.800 --> 04:23.000
What Happened In Here?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.900
Oh, What, The Mess?
I Got That.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.200
Partially.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.900
I Guess The Guy Who Was
In Here Going Through Your System--

04:29.900 --> 04:30.600
- Kevin Lynch.
- YEAH.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.100
He Made A Little Bit Of A Mess.
Don't Worry About It.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.500
He Changed Everything.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.200
Changed Everything?
What Are You Talking About?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.000
He Adjusted The--The...

04:39.200 --> 04:41.000
Oh...Forget It.
It'll Be...

04:41.200 --> 04:43.100
Go. You Need To Get
To L.A.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.900
No, Listen, I'm Gonna
Stick Around For A While.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.100
I Think You Might Need Me.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.000
Stick Around?

04:47.200 --> 04:47.900
Yeah.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.600
The Team Can Handle
One Case Without Me.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.700
They'll Be Fine.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.600
Honey, I Know You Love Me,
But The Prospect Of You

04:52.600 --> 04:55.000
Whirling Around Here
Trying To Fix This

04:55.000 --> 04:57.700
Is Actually More Frightening
Than Getting Shot.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.000
Garcia, Are You Sure?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.300
I Am Completely Fine.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.600
- Look. Full Range Of Motion.
- Stop, Stop, Stop.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.700
- No Pain. Uhh! Uhh!
- Stop, Stop, Stop.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.900
Will You Stop It
With The "Uhh." Stop.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.600
Go.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.600
You Know I'm Just
A Phone Call Away.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.700
Thank You.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.300
Go.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.400
Oh!

05:37.200 --> 05:38.500
Kevin Lynch,

05:39.200 --> 05:40.500
You May Be Cute...

05:42.000 --> 05:44.500
But If You Ever
Mess With My Stuff Again...

06:02.100 --> 06:03.400
What Should I Say?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.000
I Don't Know.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.300
Just Say Something.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.200
Ohh...

06:08.800 --> 06:09.500
Why'd You Hang Up?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.000
I Hate This.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
It's Not That Big A Deal.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.600
I Don't Want To Leave
A Lame Voicemail Message.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.500
All You Have To Do
Is Say Your Name.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.800
Like Yours?

06:18.100 --> 06:19.100
What's Wrong With Mine?

06:19.200 --> 06:21.100
Come On,
I Want Something Fun.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
You're A Writer.
You Promised To Help.

06:23.500 --> 06:24.500
All Right, All Right.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.300
Why Don't You Say
You Can't Answer The Phone

06:27.300 --> 06:29.300
Because You're Outu'
Living Your Life.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.700
You Hate It.

06:32.700 --> 06:33.700
I Love It.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.500
Hey, This Is Vickie.
I Can't Come To The Phone Right Now

06:38.500 --> 06:41.300
'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.
Leave It At The Beep.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.300
My Hero.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.200
Quid Pro Quo?

06:47.400 --> 06:49.600
Oh, I Love It
When You Speak Latin.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.100
Wait Till You Hear
My French.

06:52.700 --> 06:53.600
Jonny!

06:56.400 --> 06:58.000
I Know You're In There,
Jonny.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.600
Come On, Jonny, Open Up!

07:06.200 --> 07:06.800
What?

07:06.800 --> 07:09.300
Oh. I Don't Check On You
For A Few Months

07:09.300 --> 07:10.500
And You Fall Apart.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.300
What Do You Want?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.400
Are You Serious?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.300
You Have A Book Signing
In An Hour.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.500
I'm Not Going
To A Book Signing.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.900
Uh-Uh.
No, No, No, No.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.300
I'm Your Agent,
And We Got An Advance

07:20.300 --> 07:22.300
From The Publisher, Baby,
And It's A Big One.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.300
Give It Back.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.400
Come On, Jonny.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.800
These Are Your Fans.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.400
They Schlepped To A Gallery
And Camped There.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.600
All Night.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.100
Now, I Don't Know
If You Noticed,

07:31.100 --> 07:32.500
But It Rained On Them.

07:33.000 --> 07:33.900
A Lot.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.400
Ah Ha Ha. Check And Mate.

07:39.000 --> 07:39.900
Get Dressed.
I Got A Coffee

07:39.900 --> 07:41.200
Waiting For You
In The Car.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.300
What's This?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.600
It's Something
I'm Working On.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.200
What Do You Mean?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.500
That Sentence Needs
An Explanation?

08:01.300 --> 08:02.600
What About <I>Blue 6?</I>

08:02.800 --> 08:03.700
I'm Doing Something New.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.400
 <I>Blue's</I> Due In 2 Weeks.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.800
Not Gonna Happen.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.400
Not Gonna Happen?

08:10.500 --> 08:11.800
I'm Not Feeling It Anymore.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Not Feeling It.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.800
Stop Repeating
Everything I Say!

08:14.800 --> 08:15.900
Jonny, Stop It.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.200
You Have Commitments.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.500
You're A Professional.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.600
What The Hell Is This,
Anyway?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.500
All This Blood
And Decapitations.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.800
When Did Your Art
Get So Violent?

08:23.800 --> 08:27.200
I'm Working On Something New.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.500
I'll Call The Publisher.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.700
Seriously, Not All Pedestrians
Have The Right Of Way, Ok?

08:48.200 --> 08:49.200
We're Already Late!

08:49.200 --> 08:51.600
My Headache Isn't Gonna Get Any Better
With You Screaming.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.400
I Got To Admit, Jonny,

08:57.700 --> 08:59.800
The Art Is Amazing.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.400
Violent As Hell, But...

09:01.700 --> 09:02.700
Amazing.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.600
This Character--
What's His Name? Night?

09:06.100 --> 09:08.000
That's The Whole Name,
Just Night?

09:09.500 --> 09:10.600
Not Very Catchy.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.900
What About, Uh,
Night Man Or i don't know...

09:15.800 --> 09:16.800
True Knight.

09:17.000 --> 09:17.900
With A "K."

09:18.000 --> 09:18.900
No "K."

09:18.900 --> 09:20.900
- I'm Just Saying--
- No "K"!

09:21.300 --> 09:22.600
Message Received.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.000
I'm Just Asking Questions
Here, Jon.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.500
You Know How We Kind Of
Work These Things Out Together?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.400
You Think
We Work Together?

09:32.900 --> 09:34.900
I'm The Talent,
You're The Leech.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.500
What Is Wrong
With You Today?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.200
Ha Ha!

10:00.700 --> 10:02.200
Are You Gonna Work All Night?

10:02.300 --> 10:03.300
I Have A Deadline.

10:03.300 --> 10:04.600
I'm Hungry.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.300
How Does Someone
So Small Eat So Much?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.000
Let's Go Get Some Jerky.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.500
- It's Midnight.
- So?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.900
You Really Want To Go Out
In The Middle Of The Night
For Jerky?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.700
Teriyaki Jerky.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.300
Hurry Up.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.000
Will You Hurry Up?

10:23.300 --> 10:26.000
Seriously, Would You Just
Hurry The Hell Up!

10:26.900 --> 10:28.900
I Swear, If We're Not There
In 5 Minutes--

10:30.500 --> 10:31.300
Whoa.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.600
Something Big Happened.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.500
Seriously, This Is Huge.

10:44.700 --> 10:45.800
Should Have Listened To Me.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.400
It Wouldn't Have Saved
That Much Time, Reid. Let It Go.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.000
The Interchange Between
The 405 And The 101 Freeways

10:51.000 --> 10:52.400
Is Consistently Rated
The Worst Interchange

10:52.400 --> 10:53.900
In The Entire World.

10:54.300 --> 10:55.500
Why Do You Know That?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.600
It's A Government Report.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
So What?

10:58.400 --> 10:59.200
So You Work
For The Government.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.600
What, You Don't Read
The Reports?

11:00.800 --> 11:01.800
On Traffic Patterns
In A City

11:01.800 --> 11:03.600
2,500 Miles
From Where I Live?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.900
2,295 Miles.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.900
Don't Make Me Smack You In Front Of
All These People.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.000
I'm Grady, Lapd.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.900
Derek Morgan.
Dr. Reid.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.100
The Rest Of The Team's
In An Suv Behind Us.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.300
Yeah, Stuck In Traffic.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.500
Uh, So You Had
2 More Victims Last Night?

11:16.700 --> 11:19.300
They Were Discovered A Little After 3:30
By A Cleaning Crew

11:19.300 --> 11:20.500
Finishing Up
In The Building.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.300
So That's 7 Victims
Over The Past 2 Weeks.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.000
Bodies Are In The Alley.

11:24.100 --> 11:24.800
What's Left Of Them.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.100
Same Victimology?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.100
We Don't Have Positive I.D.
On Either One Of Them Yet,

11:28.100 --> 11:29.600
But The Clothing Fits.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.200
You Really Think This
Is Only One Guy, Huh?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.300
The Level Of Overkill

11:33.300 --> 11:35.400
Suggests An Unsub
In A Psychotic Break.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
Multiple Unsubs In Violent
Psychotic Breaks

11:37.400 --> 11:38.700
Operating In The Exact Same
Location

11:38.700 --> 11:40.200
Is Exceedingly Unlikely.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.700
Yeah, It's Probably One Guy.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.600
* Ooh, La  *

11:51.600 --> 11:56.500
* She Was Such
A Good Girl To Me *

11:56.500 --> 11:58.000
* Ooh, La... *

11:58.000 --> 11:59.900
He Was Supposed
To Be Here At 1 P.M.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.200
It's 1:11, Gus.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
I Just Talked To His Agent.
They're In Traffic, Ok?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.700
Maybe They Should Have
Left Earlier.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.800
Look, You Want The Agent's
Number So You Can Call
And Tell 'Em Off?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.500
I'm Just Saying.
A Schedule's A Schedule.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.700
It's Probably
The Police Activity Holding Them Up.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.000
It's All Over
The Scanner.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.800
There Were Some Murders
Near Here Last Night.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.200
Murders? Plural?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.400
2 Bodies.
Robbery-Homicide's Been There All Night.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.500
R-H Only Comes Out
For The Major Cases.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.600
If Jonny Mchale
Doesn't Show, I Promise You,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.600
I Will Take My Considerable
Business Elsewhere.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.900
You Can Leave
Right Now, Milo.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.300
Seriously, Where Would You Go,
Hero World?

12:27.300 --> 12:28.800
They Never Get Anything
Day Of Release.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.000
It's Always Over-- 

12:30.000 --> 12:31.300
I Present To You...

12:31.600 --> 12:34.000
The One And Only...

12:34.800 --> 12:35.900
Jonny Mchale.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.000
Jonny!
Jonny!

12:37.000 --> 12:38.300
Jonny, I Love <I>Blue!</I>

12:41.700 --> 12:43.500
Hey, This Way, Jonny!

12:50.100 --> 12:52.200
- No.
- Jonny.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.800
Jonny!

12:54.800 --> 12:55.400
Bobby.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.700
That Was The Personal
Appearance?

12:59.700 --> 13:01.300
Milo, Seriously, Leave.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.400
They Hate Me
At Hero World.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
Seriously.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Jonny?

13:23.700 --> 13:24.900
Jonny. Jonny?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.200
Come On, Come On,
Come On, Come On.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.500
Hey, This Is Vickie.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.700
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now

13:36.700 --> 13:38.200
'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.700
Leave It At The Beep.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.800
Vickie, Call Me, Please.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.800
Just Call Me Back.
I'm Sorry.

13:55.700 --> 13:56.600
- Uhh!
- Uh!

14:15.100 --> 14:16.700
Oh, My God.
Oh, My God!

14:17.700 --> 14:18.900
He Jumped Right Out
In Front Of Me.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.400
There Was Nothing--
There Was Nothing I Could Do.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.100
Oh, My God.
Can You Get Up?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.500
You Ok? Let Me Help You.

14:24.900 --> 14:26.900
- You Ok? Are You Ok?
- Can You Get Up?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.500
Aah!

14:29.100 --> 14:30.800
- Stop! Stop!
- what's wrong with you?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.500
Let Go Of Him!

14:34.400 --> 14:37.500
Aah! Jasper!

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
Jasper. Oh, My God.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.600
Jasper!

14:41.800 --> 14:44.400
You Son Of A Bitch!
It Was Your Fault!

14:44.500 --> 14:46.400
You Ran Right Out
In Front Of Us!

14:46.500 --> 14:47.800
It Was Your Fault!

14:50.100 --> 14:52.100
Baby, Are You Ok?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.300
Jasper.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.900
I'd Say It's Definitely
Our Guy.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.800
Same Victimology.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.600
Hotch...

15:02.100 --> 15:04.000
This Guy's Getting
Off-The-Charts Brutal.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.300
Do You Know That
A Domestic Cat

15:06.300 --> 15:07.500
Loose In A Normal
Neighborhood

15:07.500 --> 15:09.100
Is The Equivalent
Of A Small-Scale

15:09.100 --> 15:10.700
Ecological Disaster?

15:11.700 --> 15:12.600
Excuse Me?

15:13.500 --> 15:14.800
They'll Kill Anything
They Can--

15:14.800 --> 15:16.900
Bugs, Rodents, Birds,

15:16.900 --> 15:18.200
Other Cats,

15:18.300 --> 15:20.400
Small Dogs If Possible.
Anything.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.100
That Got Something
To Do With This?

15:23.100 --> 15:26.100
An Unsub In A Violent
Psychotic Break Is Worse.

15:26.400 --> 15:31.300
You Ran right Out
In Front Of Us!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.100
Stop!

15:41.700 --> 15:42.600
What?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.600
you're blind or ???

15:44.800 --> 15:45.500
What?

15:45.500 --> 15:47.300
This Is A Crime Scene,
Moron.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.400
Go Around.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.700
Oh, Careful There.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.700
Hurt Yourself?

16:04.400 --> 16:05.400
How'd That Happen?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.600
I Think I Fell.
I Was Running.

16:17.600 --> 16:18.500
Are They Dead?

16:19.900 --> 16:21.300
Looks Like It.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.300
Are You Sure?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.700
My Name's David. Rossi.

16:25.700 --> 16:26.800
What's Yours?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.400
Jon Mchale.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
Live Around Here?

16:30.100 --> 16:30.900
Jonny!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.100
Where'd You Go, Man?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.000
What Happened To You?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.200
I Need To Get Out Of Here.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.000
Come On.
The Car's Right Here.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.000
Seriously,
Are You All Right?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.300
I Think She's Mad.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.100
Who?

16:50.100 --> 16:50.800
She Won't Call Back.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.300
I Left Tons Of Messages
Every Day.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.300
Who, Jonny?

16:53.300 --> 16:54.300
Vickie!

16:57.000 --> 16:57.400
Jonny--

16:57.400 --> 16:58.800
I Have To Tell Her
I'm Sorry.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.400
Just Rest, Jonny,
All Right?

17:03.100 --> 17:03.900
It'll Be Ok.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
Hey, This Is Vickie.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.300
I Can't Come To
The Phone Right Now 'Cause--

17:11.800 --> 17:13.800
Mmm. I Love Jerky.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.200
More Than Anyone
I've Ever Known.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.599
Do You Love It?

17:18.700 --> 17:20.800
Love Isn't Really
The Word I Would Use.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.300
My Mother Loves It, Too.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.099
Think I Got It From Her?

17:26.200 --> 17:28.099
I Highly Doubt
Something Like That's Genetic.

17:28.099 --> 17:29.500
It's Probably More
Environmental.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.900
I Wonder If The Baby
Will Love Jerky.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.000
When Did You Find Out?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.100
For Sure
This Afternoon,

17:44.100 --> 17:45.900
But I Already
Kind Of Knew.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.100
Oh, God.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.600
If It's A Boy, I Want
To Name Him Jonny,

17:51.300 --> 17:52.200
After His Daddy.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.500
Oh, Vickie.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.200
I Know A...Great Therapist.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.400
She's Helped Me Through
A Lot Of Dark Times.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.500
Go Away.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.700
She's Really Good.

18:09.900 --> 18:10.900
I Can Get You
An Appointment.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.000
Leave.

18:14.000 --> 18:14.800
Ok.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.600
We Can...

18:17.600 --> 18:19.700
Go To The Comic Shop
Some Other Day, All Right?

18:20.800 --> 18:21.700
No.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.400
Jonny, They're Your Fans.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.900
Look, It's Not Your
Problem Anymore, okay?

18:26.900 --> 18:27.800
You're Fired.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.300
What?

18:29.300 --> 18:30.900
Get The Hell Out.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.200
But You're Gonna
Need Me To...

18:33.800 --> 18:35.800
Help You To Get
This New Book On Its Feet.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.700
Get Out Of My House!

18:39.400 --> 18:40.400
Go!

18:59.500 --> 19:00.600
Uhh!

19:14.600 --> 19:15.800
Hey, This Is Vickie.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.200
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now 'Cause I'm Out Living My Life.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.400
Leave It At The Beep.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.300
Uhh!

19:52.800 --> 19:53.900
Just Take Me Home.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.700
So, This Area
Is More Or Less

20:02.700 --> 20:04.700
The Geographical Center
Of The Scenes.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.500
Detective Brady's
Putting Together A Taskforce,

20:06.500 --> 20:09.200
So We Can Canvass These 3 Blocks
In Both Directions.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.500
Any Idea How Many
Residents That Covers?

20:11.500 --> 20:13.300
Garcia Estimates
Close To 3,000.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.600
A Lot Of These Buildings
Are Single Room Occupancy.

20:15.900 --> 20:16.900
High Turnover Rate.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.500
So It's Transient.
There Aren't A Lot Of Records.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.700
- Press Conference Went Well.
- good.

20:20.700 --> 20:21.700
I Think The Media
Understands

20:21.700 --> 20:23.100
What We're Looking For.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.600
Should Be On Local
Affiliates Now.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.900
Hopefully We Can Thin Out
The Suspect List.

20:30.700 --> 20:31.800
Ohh!

22:17.600 --> 22:18.500
Oh, My God.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.600
Aah! Aah!

22:26.700 --> 22:28.700
I Wonder If The Baby
Will Love Jerky.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.500
Baby?

22:34.300 --> 22:35.400
When Did You Find Out?

22:35.400 --> 22:36.800
For Sure This Afternoon.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.600
But I Already
Kind Of Knew.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.300
If It's A Boy, I Want
To Name Him Jonny,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.200
After His Daddy.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.400
Vickie...

22:47.200 --> 22:48.600
I Love You So Much.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.400
Wait. Wait, Wait, Wait.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.300
Oh, My God.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.500
I Promise First Thing
In The Morning

22:54.500 --> 22:56.700
I Will Buy A Big, Big Ring.

22:56.900 --> 22:57.900
Jonny,
You Don't Have To.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.700
Vickie Wright,
Will You Marry Me?

23:02.900 --> 23:03.900
Vickie?

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
Jonny.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.700
Stop! Aah!

23:15.700 --> 23:16.900
Aah!

23:17.900 --> 23:18.900
Vickie?

23:24.200 --> 23:24.900
Vickie?

23:51.600 --> 23:52.800
Same Type Of Victims?

23:52.800 --> 23:53.900
All Gang-Bangers.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.400
Good Riddance,
You Ask Me.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.400
Who's That?

23:56.700 --> 23:57.200
It's Benson.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.100
He's From
The Gang Taskforce.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.000
If Anyone Had
A Violent End Coming...

24:01.400 --> 24:02.400
What's The Scene Like?

24:02.400 --> 24:03.900
It's Actually
The Gang Leader's

24:03.900 --> 24:05.100
Personal House.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.400
Guy Named Glen Hill.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.600
Street Name Is Reaper.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.000
Guess Why.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.500
Only Benson And Me
Have Been Inside.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.500
I Didn't Do Much.
I Kind Of Backed Out The Minute I Saw Him.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.400
How Many?

24:14.400 --> 24:16.800
6. 4 Inside, 2 Outside.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.100
No Survivors At All?

24:19.100 --> 24:20.200
Never Thought
I Could Feel Sorry

24:20.200 --> 24:22.900
For These Gang-Banging
Sons Of Bitches.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.500
We'll Be There
In A Few Minutes.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.200
He Actually Went To
The Gang-Bangers' House.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.800
The Other Victims Were In
Alleys And Dark Corners.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.700
It Could Be The Unsub
Was Initially Just Defending Himself.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.100
Like Bernie Goetz,
Riding The Subways With A Gun,

24:35.100 --> 24:36.600
Waiting For Someone
To Confront Him.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.200
Except He's Seeking
Them Out Now O

24:38.200 --> 24:40.300
Because Psychotics
In A Break Always Devolve.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.500
Only A Matter Of Time
Before He Becomes Dangerous
To Those Closer To Him.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.800
No! No! Stop!

24:52.500 --> 24:53.400
Vickie?

25:11.100 --> 25:12.000
Ohh.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.800
Oh!

25:15.100 --> 25:16.000
Where's Vickie?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
Jonny?

25:19.400 --> 25:20.600
You Scared Me.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.800
Do You Need Something,
Sweetheart?

25:23.200 --> 25:24.700
Oh, You Hurt Yourself.

25:24.700 --> 25:25.700
Where did Vickie Go?

25:26.200 --> 25:27.000
I'm Sorry.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
She Was On The Fire Escape.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.000
- Who?
- Vickie, My Fiancee.

25:31.300 --> 25:32.600
You Have A Fiancee?

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
She Was On
The Fire Escape.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.500
When?

25:36.000 --> 25:36.800
Just Before I Came In.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.300
Oh, Caesar Was Out There.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.700
I Saw Her Come In Here.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.400
Jonny, Nobody
Came In Here.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.600
- don't lie to me.
- I'm Not Lying To You.

25:43.700 --> 25:44.700
Where Is She?

25:44.700 --> 25:45.900
No!

26:05.900 --> 26:07.000
T.S.K?

26:07.600 --> 26:09.100
Twenty-Third Street Killers.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.800
Looks Like They Tried
To Fight Back.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.100
They Failed.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
Are we Sure This Isn't

26:13.500 --> 26:16.100
Some Kind Of Gang
Retaliation Kind Of Thing?

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
You're On The Taskforce.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.600
Ever See A Street gang
Do Something Like This?

26:19.900 --> 26:20.800
Yeah, But...

26:21.100 --> 26:22.100
One Guy?

26:22.200 --> 26:25.100
One Guy With A Weapon, Psychotic Rage,
Surprise On His Side.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.500
Yeah, Just Look At Any School
Or Workplace Shooting.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.000
So What Do We Do Now?

26:29.200 --> 26:30.600
Ready Doing It.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.300
An Unsub In A Psychotic Rage
Stands Out.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.500
Agent Jareau's Got The Media

26:34.500 --> 26:35.900
Playing The Press conference every hour

26:35.900 --> 26:38.000
She's Putting The Profile
Out To The Public.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.200
Someone In This Man's World
Knows He's In Crisis.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.000
Hopefully They'll
Recognize The Description.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.700
Hotch.
You Need To See This.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.800
Bitch! I Know
She Was Down There.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.900
I Saw Her!

26:51.100 --> 26:52.000
Oh, God.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.000
Jonny?

26:55.000 --> 26:55.900
Suhh!

27:12.500 --> 27:13.800
Uhh!

27:18.200 --> 27:19.600
- No!
- Lapd Hotline.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.500
Yes, Sir.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Right.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.700
I Got One Says He Thinks
It's God's Mighty Vengeance.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.500
Could Use
Some Help Down Here.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.600
Lapd Tip Line.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.000
Agent Jareau?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.000
We Have Some People Out Front
You Need To Talk To.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.700
Ma'am, Could You Hold,
Please?

27:38.100 --> 27:39.500
They Saw
Your Press Conference.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.400
Uh, Detective, Line 3.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.400
Fbi!

27:49.800 --> 27:51.700
What Did I Do?
What Did I Do?!

27:51.700 --> 27:53.800
Uh! Ow! Wh'd I Do?

29:26.400 --> 29:27.900
i haven't done anything.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.600
There's Been
A Big Mistake Here.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.700
Then It'll Work
Itself Out, Jonny.

29:32.700 --> 29:35.100
I Just Dracomic Books.
I'm An Artist.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.200
That Guy Out There, Bobby,
I Fired Him.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.200
He's Probably Just Mad. 

29:38.200 --> 29:39.800
He's Not Mad At You
At All.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.900
Then Why Would He Say
That I Did Something?

29:42.900 --> 29:44.100
That's Why He's Here,
Right?

29:44.600 --> 29:46.000
You Remember I Read
You Your Rights?

29:47.100 --> 29:48.100
Jonny, Look At Me.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.600
Tell Me That You Understand
That You Can Have A Lawyer Present

29:51.600 --> 29:52.700
Before You Speak
To Anybody.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.600
I Don't Want A Lawyer.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.100
Tell Me
That You Understand.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.500
I Understand.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.600
Somebody's Gonna Be In
To Talk To You Real Soon.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.900
There's Been
A Big Mistake Here.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.400
I Haven't Done Anything!

30:17.600 --> 30:18.500
That's A Lot.

30:18.600 --> 30:19.500
There's More.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.700
Did You Find
The Murder Weapon?

30:21.300 --> 30:22.400
Didn't Need To.

30:22.600 --> 30:23.500
Why Is That?

30:23.500 --> 30:26.200
Mr. Mchale Is A Very Sick
Young Man.

30:29.000 --> 30:29.600
This Is Exactly--

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Yeah.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.800
Can You Go Get The Mug Shot
Of Glen Hill?

30:32.800 --> 30:33.900
Yeah. Give Me A Minute.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.400
Is That All From
Jonny's Studio?

30:41.500 --> 30:42.200
Yes, Sir.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.400
He's Not A Killer.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.600
He's Just Sick.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.200
You Did The Right Thing
By Coming Here, Mr. Kim.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.900
Now, You Said You Hadn't
Seen Him For A Couple Months

30:51.900 --> 30:52.900
Before Today?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.300
Yeah.

30:55.700 --> 30:56.600
I, Uh...

30:59.400 --> 31:00.900
You Get Busy, You Know?

31:02.300 --> 31:03.700
There Was No Reason To...

31:04.500 --> 31:07.000
You Know...Go There.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.500
That's Glen Hill.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
He's Missing.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.300
You Think I Know
Where He Is?

31:33.300 --> 31:34.800
6 Months Ago
He And His Gang

31:34.800 --> 31:37.100
Victimized You
And Your Girlfriend, Right?

31:37.800 --> 31:38.500
What?

31:38.700 --> 31:40.100
They Attacked You
On The Street.

31:40.600 --> 31:41.400
No.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.900
And You Couldn't Identify
Any Of Them

31:42.900 --> 31:44.600
After You Got Out
Of The Hospital.

31:49.300 --> 31:50.400
This Is Crazy.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.400
Hey, How You Feeling,
Baby Girl?

32:00.400 --> 32:04.000
I--I Just Can't Seem
To Get My Chair Adjusted

32:04.000 --> 32:06.100
Just Right Again,
But...

32:07.000 --> 32:09.100
Other Than That,
I'm Mortified.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.100
Mortified?

32:10.100 --> 32:11.100
Please Tell Me The Unsub

32:11.100 --> 32:13.100
Isn't Jonny Mchale, the graphic novelist.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.500
don't Tell Me You're
The Grapa Fan Of This Guy.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.800
Oh, My God, yes.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
He's A Genius.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.200
Well, Sweetheart, you should see what he thought

32:18.200 --> 32:20.000
The Victims Looked Like
Before He Killed Them.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.600
Sometimes For An Artist,
The Only Difference

32:21.600 --> 32:24.700
Between Insanity And Genius
Is Success.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.400
I Believe You're Suffering
A Post-Traumatic Form a Psychotic break.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.500
Psychotic?

32:31.500 --> 32:32.800
You Have Been
For Weeks.

32:32.800 --> 32:33.300
Come On.

32:33.300 --> 32:35.400
It's Possible
You Don't Even Know.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.700
How Could I Not Know?

32:40.200 --> 32:41.700
That's A Page From Something
I'm Working On.

32:41.800 --> 32:42.600
We Know.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.700
This Is A Murder Scene
From 2 Nights Ago.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.100
You Were There.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.000
Yesterday.
I Talked To You.

32:50.300 --> 32:51.700
We Have Photos Of You.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.400
Wait. This Is Real?

32:53.400 --> 32:56.000
These Are Members Of
The Twenty-Third Street Killers.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.900
Glen Hill's Gang.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.700
And There Were
6 Gang Members Murdered In That House

33:00.700 --> 33:01.700
Last Night.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.200
This Was On Your Drawing Board
When We Arrested You.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.400
No, No, This Can't Be.
It Doesn't Make Any Sense.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.000
This House Belongs
To Glen Hill.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.600
There Was A Trail Of Blood
Leading Out The Back Door.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.400
We Believe That You Took
Mr. Hill With You When You Left.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.800
Is This His Phone?

33:21.800 --> 33:23.200
It On The Floor
When We Took Him Down.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.000
Looks Like All The Calls He Makes 

33:30.000 --> 33:31.400
Are To The Same Number.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.500
Dial It.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.300
Maybe It's Somebody
Who Can Help Us.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.600
Or At Least Help Him.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.300
Hey, This Is Vickie.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.100
I Can't Come To The Phone
Right Now 'Cause I'm Out

33:46.100 --> 33:46.900
Living My Life.

33:46.900 --> 33:48.200
Leave It At The Beep.

33:48.800 --> 33:49.600
Vickie?

33:50.100 --> 33:50.900
Vickie.

33:51.100 --> 33:52.400
That Was His Girlfriend.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.400
All These Calls Were Made

33:54.400 --> 33:55.800
Within The Last 2 Days.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.300
Sometimes What An Unsub Does
Actually Makes Sense.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.900
These Are Just Drawings--
My Imagination.

34:04.900 --> 34:08.600
Severe Ptsd Is Not Uncommon
For Victims Of Violent Crime.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.500
Victims?

34:09.500 --> 34:10.600
You're Bleeding.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.100
It Looks Like
A Grazing Gunshot Wound.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.100
did they Shoot You
Last Night?

34:13.100 --> 34:15.800
Look, Stop It.
I Would Know If I'd Been--

34:16.300 --> 34:16.800
--
A Victim.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.000
yOu Remember
Being In The Hospital?

34:18.000 --> 34:18.600
I Was Never--

34:18.600 --> 34:20.199
That's Your Medical Report.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.100
They Cut You Open,
Mr. Mchale.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.800
Call Ahead.
We Got...

34:32.199 --> 34:33.300
You Were Nearly
Evisceraevis

34:33.300 --> 34:35.699
They Said It Was a Miracle You Lived.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.100
Miracle?

34:37.100 --> 34:39.100
You Think Living
Was A Miracle?

34:41.100 --> 34:43.100
All Your Drawings Reflect
Actual Crime Scenes.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.400
All Of Them But One.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.400
Where Is <I>This</I> Crime Scene,
Jonny?

34:46.400 --> 34:48.100
- Is This Glen Hill?
- Where Is He?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.500
Where's Glen Hill?

34:49.500 --> 34:50.699
Aah!

34:50.699 --> 34:52.400
No! No!

34:55.000 --> 34:56.600
You Don't Know
What's Out There!

34:57.300 --> 34:59.000
No One Knows
About The Night!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.200
We Don't Want
To Hurt You, Jonny.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.200
It's Ok, Son.
It's Ok.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.300
I Couldn't Help Her.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.400
Jonny, You Don't
Have To...

35:09.400 --> 35:11.100
Vickie Wright,
Will You Marry Me?

35:15.000 --> 35:15.900
Vickie?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
Jonny.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.900
Answer Him, Baby.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.100
The Man Ask you
A Question.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.600
We Don't Want
Any Trouble, Guys.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.200
Don't Much Matter
What You Want.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.500
Look, I've Got A Little Bit Of Money.
It's Not A Lot--

35:28.500 --> 35:29.300
Answer Him!

35:29.300 --> 35:30.600
Yes, Yes,
I'll Marry You.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.400
It's Ok, Vickie.
It's Ok.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.500
See, Bro? You Got More
Than You Thought.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.500
You Got A Fiancee.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.700
- No! No, Jonny!
- - No!

35:39.700 --> 35:40.600
Jonny! Aah!

35:40.600 --> 35:41.800
- Get Off Me!
- Jonny!

35:41.800 --> 35:43.200
Help! Stop!

35:43.200 --> 35:43.900
Get Off Me!

35:43.900 --> 35:45.500
You're Not Gonna
Want To Miss This.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.300
They Made Me Watch.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.400
It Can Help You

35:52.600 --> 35:54.100
If We Can Tell The Court

35:54.100 --> 35:56.100
That You Told Us
Where Glen Hill Is.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.400
They Made Me Watch.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.200
I Know. I Know.
They're Animals.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.500
You Were Sick. You Didn't
Know What You Were Doing.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.500
Where's Glen Hill,
Jonny?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.700
You're Not Gonna
Want To Miss This.

36:21.300 --> 36:22.700
Aah!

37:29.200 --> 37:31.500
Just Leave It Alone
Until I Get There.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.700
Hey. Hey. Hard-Head.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.400
Don't Make Me Spank You
When I Get Back.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.900
Don't Listen To Him, Garcia.
He's All Talk. Ow!

37:39.100 --> 37:40.500
J.J., He Just Hit Me.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.500
You Boys Behave
Or I Will Ground You Both.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.100
Is That One
Of Jonny Mchale's Books?

37:46.100 --> 37:48.100
Yeah, It's, Uh,
It's Called <I>Blue.</I>

37:48.100 --> 37:50.100
It's About A Girl
Who Thinks She's A Real Human Being, Right?

37:50.100 --> 37:52.800
But It Turns Out She's A Robot 
That Was Built By Her Uncle.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.600
So It's <I>Pinocchio.</I>

37:54.700 --> 37:55.600
Yeah,
It Is Like <I>Pinocchio,</I>

37:55.600 --> 37:59.300
Only, Uh, Set In A High School
In Outer Space.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.000
Oh, By The Way, What
Happened To Vickie's Phone?

38:02.000 --> 38:02.600
Phone?

38:02.600 --> 38:05.000
The One That Jonny
Kept Calling, With Her Message On It?

38:05.000 --> 38:06.600
Oh, We Gave Them Both
Back To Him.

38:07.700 --> 38:08.500
You Know, I Couldn't Imagine

38:08.500 --> 38:11.500
Having Nothing Left
Of Someone But A Voice Message.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.300
I Think I'd Never Stop
Listening To It.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.100
Yeah, It's Sad.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.000
Hey, Did You Know
That Carlo Lorenzini,

38:18.000 --> 38:18.900
The Guy That Wrote
 <I>Pinocchio,</I>

38:18.900 --> 38:20.900
Was Said To Be Obsessed
With The Human Nose?

38:20.900 --> 38:21.800
- As A Matter Of Fact,
- Wow.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.700
pinocchio Wasn't Even
The First Character--

38:22.700 --> 38:24.500
Interesting. Coffee?

38:24.900 --> 38:26.800
I'm All Right. Thank You,
Though, For Asking.

38:34.900 --> 38:35.800
Something Wrong?

38:38.300 --> 38:40.100
He's The First Unsub
I've Worked

38:40.200 --> 38:41.400
Who Wasn't A Bad Guy.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.500
You Know?

38:43.400 --> 38:44.400
6 Months Ago,

38:45.100 --> 38:47.400
Jonny Mchale Was Just
A Regular Person.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.200
Every Unsub Is Ill
On some Level.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.000
Most Can't Help
What They Do

38:52.000 --> 38:53.500
Any More Than Jonny Could.

38:53.500 --> 38:57.000
But He Went 
From Successful Writer And Artist

38:57.100 --> 39:00.200
To Brutal Killer
In 6 Months.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.300
He Suffered
An Unbelievable Tragedy.

39:03.200 --> 39:04.200
I Know.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.100
I Get It.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.700
So What's Bugging You?

39:09.300 --> 39:10.700
It Just Makes Me Wonder...

39:12.100 --> 39:16.500
Are We All Capable Of Becoming
Something Like That?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.700
Life Is A Hell Of A Thing
To Happen To A Person.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.200
You Really Don't
Have To Do This.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.500
Woman, Will You Hush.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.800
I Can Do It Myself.
I Just Can't Grip Anything Too Tight Yet,

39:40.800 --> 39:41.900
And When I Tried To Do It,
It Kept Falling--

39:41.900 --> 39:44.800
Will You Sit
Your Motormouth Down.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.700
Oh...See, Now,
That's Perfect.

39:51.000 --> 39:51.500
Yeah?

39:51.500 --> 39:52.500
Totally.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.300
