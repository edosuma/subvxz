WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.502
Whoa.
Going out tonight?

00:03.504 --> 00:06.505
Your hair looks extra shiny
today, like a unicorn's mane.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.140
Oh! No. No plans.
I just... Washed it.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.876
You should wash it every day.
You look amazing.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.781
I do wash it every day.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.115
Hm.
I do look good.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.383
(camera shutter clicking)

00:18.452 --> 00:20.986
Oof.
Not my best angle.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.253
(camera shutter clicking)

00:22.289 --> 00:24.489
Yikes.
Where did that come from?

00:25.326 --> 00:26.458
(camera shutter clicking)

00:26.593 --> 00:27.392
Oh!

00:27.461 --> 00:29.528
Now, I'm cooking with gas.

00:29.663 --> 00:30.595
Ah!

00:30.631 --> 00:33.065
I was just looking
for an earring.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.167
The trick is to
look away from the camera,

00:35.169 --> 00:36.734
Like you're talking to someone,

00:36.771 --> 00:39.538
And take the picture right as
you turn into the camera.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.874
Wow. You're like the annie
leibovitz of selfies.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.508
Yeah, you don't
bag a guy like marko

00:43.577 --> 00:45.244
Without knowing
how to work a phone.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.378
So, just sit back and turn.
Mm-hm.

00:47.415 --> 00:48.746
(camera shutter clicking)

00:48.783 --> 00:50.716
Yeah.
Hm.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.084
Wow.
I look like--

00:52.153 --> 00:53.685
A completely different person.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.687
Wait, should I
not try to look like me?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.021
Ideally? No.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.490
What? Why?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.025
What do I look like?

01:00.027 --> 01:01.793
♪ I don't lose my cool ♪

01:01.862 --> 01:05.197
♪ I love to call you mine ♪

01:05.332 --> 01:08.700

I'm with you, my baby ♪

01:08.769 --> 01:11.302

01:11.338 --> 01:15.307

01:15.309 --> 01:16.441
(whimpering)

01:16.510 --> 01:18.310
Oh, yeah.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.446
Nicorette! What up?

01:21.515 --> 01:24.116
Ah, when did we get this guy?

01:24.118 --> 01:26.117
So adorbs, right?

01:26.153 --> 01:27.252
I totally get
why cruella de vil

01:27.387 --> 01:28.720
Wanted to make a
coat out of them.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.455
I mean, I wouldn't,
but cutest coat ever.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.424
What do you think it's worth?
Two grand? More?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.192
We're not selling the dalmatian.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.660
Who included you in this?

01:35.696 --> 01:36.862
(barking)

01:36.864 --> 01:38.796
(whimpering)

01:40.067 --> 01:41.199
Shannon: Aw!

01:41.235 --> 01:43.001
So, I can't sell a used dog,

01:43.070 --> 01:44.803
But you can perv on those two?

01:44.872 --> 01:47.539
Max is just showing his friend
around; it's so cute.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.008
Nikki:
They're hella horny,
you can tell.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.476
She wants to strip him down.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.145
'kay, you say that about
literally everyone.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.880
Hey, I didn't make this
sex-crazed world.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.148
I just live in it.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.017
Speaking of:
Here's your 'daddylovah'.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.886
Hey, shans.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.622
Hey... Jeffy.
How's m'boy?

02:03.691 --> 02:05.290
Oh! I was going to
ask the same thing.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.192
And from him
it would make sense.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.060
Max!
Hey, bud!

02:09.096 --> 02:10.261
Who's that?

02:10.297 --> 02:11.663
Uh... I don't know.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.099
Maybe he didn't
recognize you with,

02:14.101 --> 02:16.034
Ah, facial hair
and a new jacket?

02:16.036 --> 02:18.971
Or he's just trying to look cool
in front of his girlfriend.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.905
Uh, max does not
have a girlfriend.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.374
Beg to differ, big tech.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.444
I-I think she just means
max might have a little crushy.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.045
Max: Over here, see,
we got these little cats.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.548
No. That's not-- he's never
even mentioned a girl, so--

02:29.550 --> 02:31.516
Right! Who knows? Not me.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.785
Probably you.
Papa knows best.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.287
Max:
He hasn't learned
to pee on it yet.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.722
My god, max.
You're hilarious.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.922
Jeffery: Oh, boy.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.124
That ain't no thang.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.725
Me and my cousin
held hands for years.

02:40.794 --> 02:41.727
Not nikki.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.329
Male cousin - johnny.
Remember johnny?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.998
Kind of tall, handsome.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.867
Not handsome, but, uh...

02:48.936 --> 02:50.135
Max?

02:50.270 --> 02:51.937
Come talk to dad.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.539
I'm sure you'd know if anything
was going on, that's all.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.275
Yeah. He tells me everything.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.442
(clearing throat)

02:57.444 --> 02:59.010
How you doing?

02:59.046 --> 03:00.412
Fine.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.514
Ooh, he does
tell you everything.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.949
So...

03:03.951 --> 03:08.486
Just thought you and your
friend might want a ride home?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.256
(clearing throat)

03:11.325 --> 03:13.491
I'm good, thanks.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.493
Yeah. Uh, blair
and I are good, thanks.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.530
Oh! Sure.
Okay. Cool.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.932
Just, uh...
I guess I'll see you at home.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.534
'kay.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.703
If it makes you
feel any better,

03:24.772 --> 03:27.172
I was sexually active at 14
and I still live at home.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.640
Just 'cause he's boinking,

03:28.642 --> 03:30.242
Doesn't mean he doesn't
want his laundry done.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.144
Right.

03:32.146 --> 03:34.312
Well, cheers.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.381
Bye.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.318
Did jeffrey have a tan?

03:40.354 --> 03:43.655
Yeah.
Dad vibes, but... Beachy.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.191
I'd hit that.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.061
Your dad's hot.
Deal with it.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.496
Yeah. That's... Nikki.

03:51.498 --> 03:54.533
♪ I'm getting lost in you ♪

03:54.668 --> 03:56.134

03:56.170 --> 03:59.538

03:59.540 --> 04:02.541
Yeah! And I could probably
work out a discount

04:02.676 --> 04:04.475
For a bulk cone purchase.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.746
Well, kristian's been looking
for a reason to bulk up.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.748
Just call me heracles...

04:09.817 --> 04:11.650
Who was greek.
That's how you pronounce it.

04:11.719 --> 04:15.953
Well, I shouldn't work out
because I've just had surgery.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.689
Bark, bark!

04:17.824 --> 04:19.157
Ha.
(chuckling nervously)

04:19.226 --> 04:20.692
Well, all this sounds good.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.428
Yeah, we could be, ah,
'conevinced' to put in an order.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.030
Abby: Okay.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.766
Yeah, we're just 'coneing'
around to the idea.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.303
Kristian already
made a cone pun, so...

04:31.305 --> 04:32.570
Ah.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.507
Well, one cone never
have too much wordplay.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.175
Or, yeah, maybe one can.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.476
Well, I should go.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.312
I'll keep you
updated on the order.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.446
Yeah.

04:41.581 --> 04:42.781
Thanks so much, guys!

04:42.783 --> 04:45.383
Yeah, sorry.
Ah, bye, abby.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.385
Totally agree.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.053
(phone ringing)

04:48.055 --> 04:49.854
Actually, this is ravi.
I'm just going to-- hey, babe.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.392
Aw, you didn't have to call
just to tell me that.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.394
I think this is stuck.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.338
♪

05:06.340 --> 05:08.640
Oh, hey, max.
Everything good?

05:08.775 --> 05:09.607
Yeah.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.176
Ah, well, I don't mean to pry,

05:11.245 --> 05:14.012
But I've just been noticing a
bit of an attitude shift.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.614
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.682
That's just 'cause I'm just
missing an insole in one shoe.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.586
No, I meant more
your... 'daditude'.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.021
Sorry?
Look, I know you
want your space,

05:23.023 --> 05:24.956
But that doesn't mean
you have to shut him out.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.524
You mean the way you did?

05:26.526 --> 05:28.093
Uh, well, no. We were dating;
that's different.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.160
Why? Did he say that?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.829
Look, it's-- it's, um...

05:30.831 --> 05:32.764
It's just kind of hard to talk
to him about, you know...

05:32.800 --> 05:33.832
Girl stuff.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.966
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.034
Well, I'm sure if--

05:36.169 --> 05:37.235
You're a girl.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.537
Oh, wow. Yes, I am.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.105
Uh, more of a woman, but--

05:40.107 --> 05:41.105
Blair's really nice.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.174
Mm-hm.
I bet your...

05:42.309 --> 05:43.908
Dad would agree.
Yeah.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.844
She's the only one in my karate
class who doesn't yell,

05:45.846 --> 05:47.846
"finish him!"
and-and she wrote this poem

05:47.848 --> 05:49.915
About her dog, scout,
who passed away recently,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.850
So we've both lost
someone that we love.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.519
Aww. That sounds great.
Ah, not the losing loved ones,

05:54.654 --> 05:56.922
But it sounds like
you guys connected.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.457
I feel that she wants to try
to move things forward,

05:58.592 --> 05:59.791
And-and so do I.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.126
I-I just want to try
to make everything nice.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.195
At least not screw it up.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.997
Aw, max.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.532
This-this is really stupid.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.167
No, no!
It's very sweet.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.069
I just wish more guys were like
you instead of, "hurry up!

06:11.071 --> 06:12.937
"my parents will be
home from the keg soon,"

06:12.973 --> 06:15.207
Or "let's go camping" -- code
for "let's do it in the park."

06:15.342 --> 06:16.841
Never thought about camping.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.943
Just be honest.
Talk to blair about it,

06:18.979 --> 06:22.547
And if you both do decide
that you are ready for...

06:22.616 --> 06:25.617
Intimité, then-then go for it!

06:25.752 --> 06:27.652
When I was your age, it was
all I could think about,

06:27.654 --> 06:29.220
And then you get
a little bit older

06:29.256 --> 06:30.889
And you still think about it,
but not as much.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.824
And then, one day you
wake up and you realize

06:32.860 --> 06:34.826
You haven't thought about it in
close to a year and you think,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.561
"what is wrong with me?
Is this it?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.231
"just a condo with cats
and, if I'm being honest,

06:39.366 --> 06:41.566
"even they seem bored."

06:41.602 --> 06:44.803
Shannon, uh,
are we talking about sex?

06:44.938 --> 06:47.506
Uh, you said that you wanted
to move things forward.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.374
I meant to, like,
dinner, or a movie.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.709
That's why I asked you.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.278
So, you think that
blair wants sex?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.712
No, no!
I mean, I don't know.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.714
I mean, everyone moves
at their own pace.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.983
So, this is your pace?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.285
Max, the important
thing is communication,

07:00.420 --> 07:01.786
So no one's
embarrassed, or hurt,

07:01.822 --> 07:05.123
Or confused by what
you're talking about.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.425
So, a movie's fine, then?

07:06.560 --> 07:09.661
Yes! A movie is great!
Very romantic.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.529
But, you know,
check in with blair.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.131
She's probably
just as nervous as you are.

07:13.266 --> 07:17.202
Right. Um, so, when you and my
dad went on your first date...?

07:17.337 --> 07:20.005
Okay, we're done.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.008
Hey, good job!
I saw greta's limp is gone.

07:23.010 --> 07:23.808
Yeah.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.477
Though I kind of miss it.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.878
Gave her some swagger.

07:27.013 --> 07:30.448
Yeah, like, uh,
"back up, bitches."

07:30.451 --> 07:31.483
Sorry. What'd you say?

07:31.552 --> 07:32.617
Not important. Yeah.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.286
No, it sounded funny.
What was it?

07:34.421 --> 07:35.420
It was greta.
Uh, "back up--"

07:35.555 --> 07:36.755
(phone ringing)
I'm so sorry.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.192
Babe, you are gonna
get me in trouble.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.661
(sighing)

07:42.663 --> 07:44.296
I know that look.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.964
There's no look.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.266
Like a grocery cashier when
you pull out a coupon.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.703
I just think lara's
very nice... And sweet...

07:51.705 --> 07:54.506
And she should be with
someone who appreciates her,

07:54.641 --> 07:57.775
Makes her laugh,
enjoys the outdoors, is tall.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.944
You know, I was in love
with someone once--

08:00.013 --> 08:01.780
Oh, I'm not in--
I'm telling a story.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.315
This woman,

08:04.351 --> 08:05.584
I wanted to tell her,

08:05.586 --> 08:06.851
But she was my
best friend's wife,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.853
So I felt like I shouldn't.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.654
Loyalty.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.055
Also, he was quite high up

08:11.091 --> 08:12.991
In organized crime
and extremely jealous.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.127
One time, he knifed a guy for
calling his wife the wrong name

08:16.196 --> 08:18.663
And then he knifed the other guy
for correcting the first guy.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.999
Huh.
Well, thanks, but I'm good.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.667
That's what I thought...

08:22.736 --> 08:24.369
Until it was too late.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.004
She died?

08:26.139 --> 08:30.509
Well, she was 73.
Um, did I not mention that?

08:34.481 --> 08:38.250

08:38.385 --> 08:43.221

Taking a selfie?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.223
Oh!
Ah, no.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.592
I had pulled pork for lunch

08:47.661 --> 08:49.828
And I was just--
yeah. Selfie!

08:49.830 --> 08:52.030
Uh, but max isn't
here right now,

08:52.032 --> 08:55.766
Which I'm sure you know
'cause you know wassup.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.802
Yeah. And I'm sorry
about the other day

08:57.804 --> 08:58.770
If I was a little defensive.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.137
Oh, no! I get it.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.973
You and max have
a special relationship.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.109
You can say it.
I'm overprotective.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.943
Okay, fine, maybe a smidge.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.681
And, you were right, I talked to
max -- I hope that's okay --

09:09.816 --> 09:11.783
And the thing with
blair is very innocent.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.250
Really?
Yeah. He didn't even know

09:13.287 --> 09:15.286
How to ask her out.
I suggested a movie.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.721
I didn't want to overstep.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.323
That's great.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.157
I've been trying to give him
space, but this is a relief.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.193
I don't know what I'd do
without your friendship.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.594
Yeah!

09:23.630 --> 09:25.129
I just hope you didn't
come all this way for...

09:25.165 --> 09:26.698
Oh, no.
I'm en route to meet someone.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.299
She's in the neighbourhood.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.035
Oh! You're dating.
Yeah.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.402
We were gonna
catch a flick, too.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.470
Hope I don't run into max.

09:32.506 --> 09:33.572
I mean,
might be kind of funny.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.273
No.
Giving him space.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.543
But I'd love to talk about your
max conversation sometime.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.144
Maybe over coffee?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.613
Sure. Yeah.

09:45.385 --> 09:49.354
Okay, question: If you
broke it off with marko

09:49.423 --> 09:52.223
And he told you that he was
meeting another woman,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.058
What would your reaction be?

09:54.094 --> 09:56.027
Is it danika? Trin? Patrice?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.328
No, nikki,
you don't know this girl.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.197
Oh, some new slice?
He is so dead right now.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.167
Let's go out tonight,
find me a rebound.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.301
Okay, never mind.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.570
Pick me up at eight.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.838
Nikki, you're still working!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.039

10:08.041 --> 10:09.306

10:15.949 --> 10:17.048
Hey.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.384
Oh, thanks, paul.
Just had a little accident here.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.718
Oh. What kind of accident?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.654
Greta made a mistake.
As in?

10:22.656 --> 10:24.255
She pooped.
Ah.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.257
Sorry, kristian and I tend
to use euphemisms:

10:26.393 --> 10:27.725
'fresh pretzels,'

10:27.861 --> 10:29.394
'doggy don't-don'ts,'
'performance reviews'.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.129
He likes you, you know.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.097
What?

10:32.232 --> 10:33.831
Yeah, I just thought
you should know.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.467
He's shy, might not say.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.135
Sometimes people should just
tell each other how they feel

10:38.171 --> 10:40.138
Or else they
end up full of regret...

10:40.140 --> 10:42.340
And also happy
they weren't stabbed.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.409
Hm.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.912
Hi!
How was the date?

10:47.981 --> 10:50.581
I want all... The... 'deets'.
What movie did you guys see?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.217
Did you share popcorn?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.285
Did you both reach for it at
the same time and touch hands?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.689
We-went good.
Uh, we saw<i> die hard.</i>

10:57.824 --> 10:59.423
<i> Die hard's</i> in theatres?
Where?

10:59.459 --> 11:02.093
Uh, not sure.
It was, um, it's pretty dark.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.628
Did you take her
somewhere after?

11:04.665 --> 11:05.864
Well, um--

11:05.999 --> 11:08.199
Hey! Uh,
sorry to interrupt,

11:08.235 --> 11:10.368
But I need to talk
to you... In private.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.869
Okay.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.338
What's up?

11:14.408 --> 11:17.375
I found an item in the back.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.643
I'm gonna need more detail.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.313
It's a...

11:22.315 --> 11:24.115
Brassiere.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.285
What kind of a psychopath
gets naked in a shelter?

11:27.354 --> 11:29.320
(thudding)
ow.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.523
We should file
a report to the board

11:32.592 --> 11:34.391
And register a complaint with--

11:34.428 --> 11:35.626
It's mine.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.529
What?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.597
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was reading an article that,

11:39.666 --> 11:41.065
Uh, said that a lot of women

11:41.101 --> 11:43.000
Are wearing the wrong-sized
bra and I thought,

11:43.036 --> 11:46.471
"huh, I wonder if I'm
one of those unlucky ladies."

11:46.540 --> 11:50.141
And then, I happened to find a
tape measure in the back,

11:50.210 --> 11:53.277
And I thought, "there's no
time like the present," so...

11:53.346 --> 11:56.280
Okay, so you measured
yourself at work?

11:56.349 --> 11:57.749
In front of the dogs?

11:57.751 --> 12:00.051
And then,
forgot to put your bra back on.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.154
It sounds very unlikely,
but so true.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.889
Well, I'm glad you measured

12:04.891 --> 12:07.691
Because you are definitely
wearing the wrong size.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.494
Ah, thank you.
Yeah.

12:09.563 --> 12:13.430
Glad to have... 'ol' pink'
back in rotation.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.713
So, the movie?

12:28.848 --> 12:31.182
Uh, yeah.
We, um, we didn't actually, uh--

12:31.317 --> 12:32.851
I know.
And fyi,

12:32.853 --> 12:36.187
You can't bring girls back to
the shelter for... Sexy time.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.456
It's a violation of
workplace health and safety,

12:38.458 --> 12:39.590
And I've worked too hard

12:39.626 --> 12:41.525
To have our reputation
ruined by a couple of...

12:41.661 --> 12:43.060
Horny teenagers.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.729
Totes normal, sexuality
is healthy, no shame,

12:45.766 --> 12:47.131
But this stops now.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.332
I'm so sorry, okay?

12:48.401 --> 12:49.934
You told me to
follow blair's lead

12:49.936 --> 12:51.669
And she kind of led me here
and there and...

12:51.738 --> 12:53.338
Kind of everywhere.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.406
Oh, my god. I promised your dad
he had nothing to worry about

12:55.475 --> 12:57.942
When, clearly, he should be more
worried than he already is!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.477
No, you're not going
to tell him, are you?

12:59.612 --> 13:00.812
I don't know what to do.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.447
This whole thing's
just been a huge mess.

13:03.517 --> 13:06.217
Why? What happened?

13:06.352 --> 13:08.285
I-I asked blair to the movies,
like you told me to.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.854
I didn't tell you.
I just suggested.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.356
I was showing her
around the kennels,

13:11.358 --> 13:12.957
And I just kept thinking
about what you said -

13:12.959 --> 13:14.358
That I should go for it

13:14.427 --> 13:16.093
While I'm still young
enough to feel something,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.195
So I don't end up all
sad when I'm your age.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.698
That's a very liberal
interpretation of what I said.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.234
I-I know it was wrong to...

13:23.236 --> 13:25.769
I mean, you know... Here,
but it just--

13:25.806 --> 13:28.006
It happened so fast,
and I mean, like,

13:28.008 --> 13:29.506
Really, really fast.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.242
Is it always supposed
to be that fast?

13:31.278 --> 13:34.511
No, that's pretty normal
for a boy's first time.

13:34.548 --> 13:35.880
No, I-I meant blair -

13:35.882 --> 13:37.982
She was done in,
like, five minutes.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.617
Oh! Uh, well,

13:39.653 --> 13:43.254
There's nothing wrong with
healthy female... 'sexuocity'.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.822
So, is it like
that for you, too?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.524
Or did it used to be, or wh...?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.392
Well, the important thing is

13:48.428 --> 13:50.461
That you were safe
and that you both had... Fun.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.864
Yeah. We were super
safe, I-I know that.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.732
I didn't even,
like, undo anything,

13:54.801 --> 13:55.867
Or take anything off, or--

13:55.936 --> 13:58.136
Is that normal, too?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.405
Maybe you should talk
to your dad about this,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.540
Get his, ah, take on it.

14:02.542 --> 14:03.674
Maybe.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.143
But, then again, last time,

14:05.145 --> 14:06.678
Your advice didn't
really work out so well.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.446
Again, I was just kind of
suggesting in a general way.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.615
And, uh, here,

14:10.617 --> 14:11.916
Blair might need this back.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.018
Thanks.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.320
Uh, shannon?

14:15.322 --> 14:16.754
Mm-hm?

14:16.823 --> 14:20.157
Um, I-I hope when I am ready to
take things to the next level,

14:20.227 --> 14:22.026
I can do it with
someone who's as honest

14:22.028 --> 14:23.561
And thoughtful as you are.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.062
That's very sweet.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.498
But please don't say that
to anyone else, okay?

14:39.813 --> 14:41.645
How's things?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.180
Not good.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.016
Lara is acting very cold.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.585
When I told her about this
study on cat pheromones,

14:47.587 --> 14:48.953
All she said was, "cool."

14:49.088 --> 14:52.123
It's not just cool.
It is ground-breaking!

14:52.125 --> 14:54.025
Maybe she's having
problems with ravi.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.259
Has she said
anything to you?

14:55.262 --> 14:56.928
Nope. None.
Nobody's... Nope.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.663
Oh.
Maybe I should ask her?

14:58.665 --> 15:01.332
Yeah, yeah.
Or that might make things worse.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.867
You know-- you know what?
I bet it would,

15:02.869 --> 15:04.135
I bet it
would make things worse.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.370
How?
Well, because--

15:06.439 --> 15:07.939
Because then
I would be intruding,

15:07.941 --> 15:09.006
Just like ravi does all day.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.276
Exactly.
(clearing throat)

15:11.411 --> 15:13.411
(cats yowling)

15:13.480 --> 15:15.079
But, what if I
never say anything

15:15.214 --> 15:17.215
And end up depressed or
heartbroken like you?

15:17.217 --> 15:19.150
Not that you're depressed
or heartbroken,

15:19.219 --> 15:21.151
But the guy
in your story was.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.286
That was me.
Right.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.489
I'll tell you what,
I'll ask her for you.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.724
Oh, would you?
Yeah. I bet it's nothing.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.192
But, um, be subtle.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.295
And thanks.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.764
Oh, hey.
Lara, you got a sec?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.099
What were you thinking?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.401
Of having a chat.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.902
No. I don't want the weirdness

15:38.037 --> 15:40.571
Of working with someone knowing
they feel that way when I don't.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.907
I also don't want to
hurt anyone's feelings.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.108
Ah, don't worry about me.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.543
I meant kristian.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.711
Oh, yeah. Well, that's
the thing - I got mixed up.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.447
Kristian is head over heels,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.249
But not for you;
for... Amy.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.052
Abby?
Yeah. That's it.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.786
Dog cone girl?

15:55.855 --> 15:57.388
Oh, wow!
Look at you.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.324
"kristian must be in love
with me and nobody else

15:59.459 --> 16:00.958
"because that's impossible."

16:00.994 --> 16:03.227
I didn't mean that,
I just-- abby?

16:03.229 --> 16:05.263
Huge crush.
Can't stop talking about her.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.397
'"abby this, abby that."

16:06.532 --> 16:07.931
It's, like,
"we get it, kristian!

16:07.968 --> 16:09.400
"you're nuts about abby."

16:09.535 --> 16:11.535
Really?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.970
Ah, no-- not you, amy.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.338
I'm abby.

♪ jump in, come here... ♪

16:21.681 --> 16:25.149
Oh! Hey there, guy.
You in the neighbourhood again?

16:25.151 --> 16:27.285
Yeah. Just wanted to see if
max needed a ride home,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.153
But it looks like you're one
of the last ones here.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.255
Yeah, burning the midnight oil.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.991
I mean, it's 6:15

16:33.126 --> 16:34.425
And I was just finishing
a sudoku, but, uh,

16:34.461 --> 16:37.228
Gots to keep the mind sharp.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.696
Thanks again for
everything you did for max.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.997
He and I had a long chat

16:40.132 --> 16:41.398
About his date with blair.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.067
Oh, I'm so glad he opened up.

16:43.069 --> 16:44.501
And you're okay with everything?

16:44.537 --> 16:47.472
I-I will be. He-he's a good kid
and I have got to trust

16:47.474 --> 16:49.306
That he's going to
make the right decisions.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.476
Exactly. You can't watch
over him all the time,

16:51.478 --> 16:53.844
And it he wants to have sex,
he is gonna have sex.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.114
He and blair are having sex?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.714
No! Probably not. Who can say?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.350
You did. Just now.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.519
Why is everyone suddenly
listening to everything I say?

17:01.588 --> 17:02.719
Wow.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.388
(sighing)

17:04.391 --> 17:07.391
Um... I know this is hard,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.260
But you knew it was going
to happen sometime.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.795
I mean, they're 17.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.263
Well, I guess.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.798
And I haven't exactly been
setting the best example,

17:14.834 --> 17:16.934
What with seeing
other people now.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.270
I guess I loosened the reins
just when he needed me most.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.038
Um, I'm sorry, but how many
others are we talking?

17:21.074 --> 17:22.340
Uh, 'cause--
'cause, me, too.

17:22.475 --> 17:23.941
I'm just trying to
compare, contrast.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.409
Oh!
Just been dating more.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.045

17:27.180 --> 17:29.147
Let go of some
of the old habits.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.750
Yeah! Absolutely.
Get out there and sex it up.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.686
A-anyway, if we're both
playing the field,

17:35.822 --> 17:39.423
Maybe we could meet up
for a game sometime?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.892
Meet for a practice,
or a little scrimmage.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.494
Really?

17:43.629 --> 17:46.063
I'd like that.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.898
Shoot!
I've got an osteo appointment.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.566
Um, but I'll call you?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.769
If you're game for a game,

18:42.956 --> 18:44.888
I love that jacket.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.891
So, are you two...?

18:46.893 --> 18:49.693
Yeah, lara, there's something
I have to tell you.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.962
Paul? Don't.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.829
I have to.
You really don't.

18:52.866 --> 18:53.864
I lied.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.699
Continue.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.202
I told you that kristian
had a crush on you.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.704
What...?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.438
Then, I told you that kristian
had a crush on abby.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.040
You said "huge crush."
hold on--

19:03.109 --> 19:04.708
And I told myself

19:04.744 --> 19:06.844
That my lies were okay
because, for a brief moment,

19:06.979 --> 19:10.447
I could correct my past by
messing with your futures.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.750
And-- and now poor abby is
in love with kristian--

19:12.885 --> 19:14.318
No, I'm not.
Oh, abby,

19:14.387 --> 19:16.453
You don't need
to be embarrassed.
I'm not.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.855
I'm ju-- I'm taking my
grandmother to the theatre.

19:18.892 --> 19:22.860
And I-I just stopped by
to say I do like you.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.395
But I'm seeing someone,

19:24.530 --> 19:26.797
And I just thought we
should just stay friends.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.133
Sure.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.267
That's nice.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.669
Well, have a nice
time at the theatre.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.638
What?
With your grandmother?

19:33.773 --> 19:35.206
Right! Duh.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.174
Well, I should go.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.710
My grandma's really
excited about...

19:39.779 --> 19:41.445
<i> Hamlet.</i>

19:46.052 --> 19:48.486
Oh... There is no boyfriend.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.354
Or theatre with grandma.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.089
Or cone discount.

19:52.091 --> 19:53.958
Well, guess we're even.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.359
I hope abby's okay.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.361
Oh, she'll be fine.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.363
Sharing your feelings is tough.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.665
But sometimes the harder thing

20:00.667 --> 20:03.167
Is not sharing them
at all, you know?

20:03.169 --> 20:04.768
I do know, actually...

20:04.804 --> 20:07.238
Because--

20:07.240 --> 20:09.106
Like one time,
I told this guy, troy -

20:09.242 --> 20:11.441
Total snack -
that I was into him.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.577
The guy was jacked,
and I thought,

20:13.646 --> 20:16.380
"if I don't say something,
I'll regret it."

20:16.515 --> 20:18.349
So, I said something.
Next thing,

20:18.418 --> 20:20.251
We're doing it
twister-style in the park,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.720
Getting stuck in a tube slide.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.322
I am so glad we're
finally sharing.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.790
Yeah. Don't get me started
on his tongue.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.124
I will not...

20:27.260 --> 20:28.259
Yeah.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.327
...Get you started on that.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.701
Again?

20:36.703 --> 20:39.036
I mean this with
the greatest respect,

20:39.171 --> 20:41.071
But you have got to stop
obsessing about your boobs.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.573
Excuse me?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.475
I think it's time
to get a professional fitting.

20:44.610 --> 20:48.212
Sorry, joy.
Uh, this is not mine.

20:48.214 --> 20:49.480
Really?

20:49.549 --> 20:52.082
Clearly.
I cannot run with those horses.

20:52.151 --> 20:53.284
Why are you wearing my bra?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.486
Sorry, I was just...

20:55.488 --> 20:57.521
I don't know how to
finish that sentence.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.023
And what, pray tell,
were you doing in the back

20:59.025 --> 21:00.624
That required you
to whip this off?

21:00.627 --> 21:03.160
I was knocking boots
with marko in meow town.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.162
Nikki!
I'm kidding!

21:05.164 --> 21:06.397
God!
Could you imagine?

21:06.399 --> 21:09.032
I really can't.
It's mostly urine.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.334
Relax.
I took my bra off

21:10.470 --> 21:11.835
Because my back was sore.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.570
Okay, enough chit-chat.
Let's get busy.

21:13.606 --> 21:17.508
And by "busy," I mean everybody
keep their bras on.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.710

to waive an adoption fee.
