Any headlines?
Everything okay?

38:38.794 --> 38:40.492
No, everything's fine.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.623
Great.

38:42.276 --> 38:44.539
So, um...

38:44.583 --> 38:47.542
I-I'm going back to my old job
at the hospital.

38:47.803 --> 38:48.891
Why?

38:48.935 --> 38:50.589
Well, you're
not a baby anymore.

38:50.632 --> 38:51.851
With all your sports
and friends,

38:51.894 --> 38:53.374
you don't need me
at home all day,

38:53.418 --> 38:55.550
and after everything
that happened yesterday,

38:55.594 --> 38:58.336
they need people
at the hospital, so...

38:59.598 --> 39:02.340
And, if you're both game,

39:02.383 --> 39:05.299
we can make this
a more regular thing.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.001
I'm cool to hang out more.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.048
Yeah, I'd like that.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.181
Great.

39:18.225 --> 39:21.184
FEMA took the direct hit
in this area here.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.101
What kind of terrorists
have a beef with the disaster
relief guys?

39:25.145 --> 39:26.886
Domestic ones.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.844
FEMA is the dark horse here.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.759
Homeland
is the logical target.

39:30.803 --> 39:32.935
JULIANNE: Agent Durand,
would you say the perpetrators

39:32.979 --> 39:36.025
had a sophisticated
understanding of HVAC systems?

39:36.069 --> 39:41.030
Yeah, to be able to direct
the gas with that level
of specificity.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.771
AGENT: Multiple air handlers
service that building.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.383
They knew which one would hit
that area of the floor
for sure.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.776
So they knew exactly where
they were sending
this message.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.299
ERICSON: Message being?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.693
"You can't get us
if we get you first."

39:55.523 --> 39:57.482
The FEMA camps
conspiracy theory?

39:58.918 --> 40:00.789
Enlighten us.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.791
Many domestic fringe groups
are convinced

40:02.835 --> 40:06.795
that FEMA responding
to a real or manufactured
disaster or threat

40:06.839 --> 40:09.755
would use
their emergency powers
to round up American patriots

40:09.798 --> 40:11.713
and take them to government
concentration camps.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.890
My Uncle Frank listens to crap
like that on talk radio
all day long.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.197
Proof positive
of the ideology's reach.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.679
If you were convinced
that your government
was conspiring against you

40:20.722 --> 40:23.333
to usher in
the coming police state,
what would you do?

40:23.377 --> 40:26.685
I don't know.
Take off my tin foil hat
and go get some fresh air.

40:26.728 --> 40:28.469
So, if we are focusing
on a domestic group...

40:28.513 --> 40:30.645
It tracks with their keeping
silent and not taking credit.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.342
Cripple the FEMA oppressors,

40:32.386 --> 40:35.215
and then humiliate
their police state handmaids.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.130
Right.

40:39.524 --> 40:40.829
So, what's their next move?

40:40.873 --> 40:42.222
I don't know.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.002
That was fast.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.134
We got lucky.

41:25.178 --> 41:28.398
Traffic cams identified
his plates this afternoon.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.228
So what are we waiting for?

41:33.621 --> 41:34.883
I was waiting for you.

41:41.324 --> 41:42.978
Police.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.503
What the hell? Get out!
Relax.

41:45.546 --> 41:47.026
Unless you have a warrant,

41:47.069 --> 41:48.810
this is straight-up illegal!

41:48.854 --> 41:51.247
The second
you picked up stakes,
this stopped being a home.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.335
You should've paid your rent.
