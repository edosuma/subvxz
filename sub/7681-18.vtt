01:12.520 --> 01:16.354
The usual problem in Los Angeles
on a lazy Saturday is what to do.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.597
Surfing in the Pacific?

01:20.760 --> 01:22.671
Skiing in the mountains?

01:22.840 --> 01:26.719
Maybe head for the beach
and watch the girls roll in.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.476
Not exactly.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.990
I was celebrating, if that's the word,
the anniversary of a friendship.

01:36.440 --> 01:39.113
I'd met Pete Thornton
seven years ago today,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.396
so I'd been running around
all morning long,

01:41.560 --> 01:44.996
following the anniversary instructions
Pete had sent me.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.034
He asked me to locate
a bar magnifying glass

01:48.200 --> 01:51.078
and bring it to him
at Adler's Wrecking Yard

01:51.240 --> 01:53.834
at 8:00 sharp.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.316
Pete always could come up
with something a little off-centre.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.233
Now, where to find him.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.639
Hey, Pete!

02:13.800 --> 02:16.314
Over here!

02:19.120 --> 02:22.430
- Pete?
- Here. Over here.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.959
Hi. What you doing?

02:25.400 --> 02:26.719
What am I doing?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.074
What are you doing?

02:28.440 --> 02:33.594
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to find a bar magnifier on a weekend?

02:33.760 --> 02:34.749
No.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.639
And what do we
want one for anyway?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.314
Get inside if you wanna ask
any more dumb questions.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.630
I can't hear you.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.838
The only way you can fit in here
is if you're a contortionist.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.911
And I don't qualify.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.230
Should have brought a flashlight.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.312
Now, what am I doing here?

02:53.480 --> 02:55.914
PIaying hide-and-seek...

02:59.040 --> 03:00.314
...for a newspaper?

03:00.480 --> 03:03.438
Well, I don't know, but your note
said to meet you here at 8:00

03:03.600 --> 03:05.830
and to bring a bar magnifier.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.912
My note?
I'm here because of your note.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.877
I never sent you a note--

03:15.320 --> 03:16.469
Jack.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.430
Dalton? That clown?

03:20.240 --> 03:23.038
Are you telling me he got us
out here on a wild-goose chase?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.838
Yeah, sure.
It's his kind of practical joke.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.150
He was part of it seven years ago
when you and I first met.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.198
- You remember that?
- How could I forget?

03:30.480 --> 03:33.438
Here. Let's see what you got.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.194
Knowing Jack, there's some
kind of goofy message.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.796
I can't believe he got us
out here this early.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.949
Here. Look at that.

03:45.480 --> 03:49.439
"In memoriam. Three dear friends
taken before their time.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.115
- Peter Thornton--"
- "Jack Dalton, MacGyver."

03:59.000 --> 04:00.433
What is going on?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.838
Doors are jammed!

04:36.160 --> 04:38.310
- Are you all right?
- Whoever got us in here

04:38.480 --> 04:40.835
wasn't Jack Dalton.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.349
AII right.
Let's see if we can raise the roof.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.030
AII right, it's moving.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.634
AII right. Here.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.872
Come on.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.799
You okay, Pete?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.791
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

06:35.960 --> 06:37.234
We're in a box.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.231
Looks Iike a semitrailer.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.799
Yeah, and we're on our way

06:40.960 --> 06:42.791
somewhere.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.030
Door is Iocked solid.
Tight as a drum.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.193
There's no access to the cab.
Does that Iook Iike a speaker to you?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.433
Yeah.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.591
The walls are insulated, soundproof.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.236
Someone really set this up.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.628
The question is, who?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.677
Did you happen to see
who was driving the forklift?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.353
No, I couldn't see a thing.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.669
Pete.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.434
Do you remember what happened
seven years ago today?

07:09.600 --> 07:11.670
Yeah. You and I first met.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.517
Yeah, chasing Murdoc.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.352
- Murdoc?
- Yeah.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.318
He's dead. He got killed
when that building collapsed.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.232
The body was never found.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.153
And Murdoc's just the kind
to set these neat, perfect Iittle traps.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.598
That was seven years ago. In the past.
The man is dead. Dead.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.273
Is he?

07:31.960 --> 07:33.791
Thornton, MacGyver,

07:33.960 --> 07:36.235
do you remember what
Mark Twain once said?

07:37.080 --> 07:42.313
The reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated.

07:45.040 --> 07:49.352
Well, Murdoc,
Iooks Iike I was wrong.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.193
You obviously have plans for us.
What are they?

07:52.360 --> 07:53.395
Guess.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.754
A Iittle trip?
Chance to get reacquainted?

07:56.920 --> 07:59.957
Exactly, MacGyver,
the three of us together again.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.838
For the next hour, anyway.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.035
Then what?

08:04.440 --> 08:05.953
Oh, and then it's over.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.272
Over.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.352
I can guess what he's
got in mind for us.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.274
It's getting close in here.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.476
Yeah, he wants us to sweat first.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.393
Yeah, first. Before he kills us.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.357
Hey, Pete, Iook.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.274
Same make, model and year
as Jack's old cab.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.832
He really set this up with
all the trimmings, didn't he?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.479
Happy anniversary.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.871
Looks Iike we're right back
where we were seven years ago.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.871
Yeah, I remember.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.034
Sixth and Beaudry.
It was the first fare of the day.

08:39.559 --> 08:43.519
And all I was trying to do was keep
Jack Dalton's taxicab in business.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.234
You free?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.038
You bet.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.990
- Where you headed?
- South and Third, please.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.355
- And I'm in a hurry.
- Emergency?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.068
Just business.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.674
PIease, step on it.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.512
Won't you, Jack?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.796
Actually, it's MacGyver
at your service, ma'am.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.393
Miss...?

09:07.560 --> 09:08.675
Sara.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.753
Sara. South and Third, coming up.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.231
It's just ahead.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.437
Stop here.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.595
You sure this is where
you wanna be dropped off?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.432
I'II be fine.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.793
Okay. Three-fifty.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.710
Keep the change.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.154
Good Iuck, Sara.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.470
- Hold it!
- Sara, Iook out!

11:30.400 --> 11:32.152
I don't know who you are,
but stay out of this!

11:32.320 --> 11:34.072
- AII right, don't shoot--
- Put a cork in it!

11:34.240 --> 11:36.231
Okay, you'II get no trouble from me!

11:49.160 --> 11:50.354
No!

11:51.600 --> 11:53.272
Get off me!

11:53.440 --> 11:57.035
- AII right.
- You are pushing it, kid!

11:57.200 --> 11:58.553
Get in the cab.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.755
- Move, move!
- I'm going!

11:59.920 --> 12:01.751
In the cab!

12:05.160 --> 12:06.559
- Go.
- I'm on my way.

12:06.720 --> 12:10.076
We are on my way!
Follow that car. Move!

12:10.240 --> 12:11.912
- Move!
- Yes, sir.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.435
Come on, step on it.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.350
I hope it's not too uncomfortable
for you back there, gentlemen.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.999
Not to worry, we'II Iive.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.470
I seriously doubt that, Thornton.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.871
Come on, Pete,
start digging into this old wreck.

12:35.040 --> 12:36.758
See if there's anything useful.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.911
In this junk heap?

12:39.320 --> 12:41.595
It's the only heap we've got.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.672
Yeah, I guess you're right.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.273
You know, you wouldn't
even be here now

12:45.440 --> 12:48.477
if you hadn't been driving
Jack's cab in the first place.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.596
Yeah, that's right.

12:50.760 --> 12:55.993
Me driving Jack's cab
and you waving your gun in my face.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.799
AII right, now slow down.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.518
Just keep that car in sight.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.477
This hack stands out
Iike a sore thumb.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.631
What were you trying to do
back there, be a hero?

13:06.800 --> 13:08.791
I figured the Iady needed help.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.317
That Iady is a top-Ievel, world-class
assassin named Murdoc

13:13.480 --> 13:15.948
whom I've been investigating
for the past six months.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.350
- You're a cop.
- A cop?

13:18.520 --> 13:19.999
Do I Iook Iike a cop?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.828
- Yeah.
- I'm a U.S. government agent.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.718
- DXS.
- What?

13:24.880 --> 13:27.155
Department of External Services.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.073
Oh, well, Iisten, I'm sorry I messed
you up back there with Murdoc.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.559
I thought she was being mugged.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.757
Well, you had no way of knowing
the truth, so you jumped in.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.839
Got yourself in over
your head this time, kid.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.035
Name's MacGyver.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.789
Pete Thornton.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.673
It Iooks Iike Murdoc is turning.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.591
Careful. Don't get too close.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.638
Don't!

14:20.480 --> 14:21.959
Bazookas.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.315
I had this arranged, just in case.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.109
And you cooperated so beautifully.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.829
She's a man.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.868
- He's a killer.
- The bazooka

14:52.040 --> 14:54.270
is a very effective weapon.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.829
Move your cab one inch
and they'II blow it.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.877
Try to get out

14:59.320 --> 15:00.389
and they'II blow it.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.391
Why didn't you tell me?

15:02.560 --> 15:05.632
I operate on a need-to-know basis.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.150
I guess you need to know.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.390
Murdoc is an international terrorist.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.152
Specializes in disguises.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.515
He's half chameleon, half rattlesnake.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.070
When he makes a hit,
he always takes a picture of his victim.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.358
Dying.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.277
Keeping an album, is he?

15:25.440 --> 15:29.752
No. One shot goes to whoever
paid for the hit as proof,

15:29.920 --> 15:33.469
and a copy to us, the DXS,

15:33.640 --> 15:35.471
just for fun.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.359
And this is who I chose to help?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.797
That's right.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.433
- Sorry I got you into this, kid.
- So am I.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.317
So, what do we do?

15:48.720 --> 15:51.029
Well, I'II tell you,

15:51.560 --> 15:53.835
I haven't got a clue.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.629
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoelaces.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.518
Your shoelaces?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.353
I got an idea.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.911
Listen, don't panic. Don't try
anything funny. Hear me?

16:15.080 --> 16:18.595
I feel I've gotten to know you
over the past five years, Peter.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.193
May I call you Peter?

16:20.360 --> 16:21.873
Just keep smiling for the camera.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.837
It's just that I do feel
as if we should be on

16:24.000 --> 16:27.595
- a first-name basis.
- Be my guest.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.672
It's been such an interesting
chess match.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.753
Myself against all the forces
of the DXS.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.716
Especially the redoubtable
Peter Thornton.

16:40.640 --> 16:42.710
- A Iasso?
- For roping the gas pedal.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.838
- Am I boring you, Peter?
- I'm fascinated. Keep talking.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.549
- Rope the gas pedal? You're crazy.
- Just keep him interested.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.678
- Listen, Murdoc, it's not over.
- Oh, but it is.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.718
- Do you remember Lisbon?
- Yeah, I almost had you.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.949
AImost.

16:57.120 --> 17:01.079
But in this game that we play,
close does not count.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.950
For you it's a game.
I'm dead serious.

17:05.119 --> 17:08.031
Oh, I'm sure you are, Peter,
I'm sure you are.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.634
Perhaps that's your biggest problem,
a total absence of humour.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.992
What are you gonna
do with a wrench?

17:14.160 --> 17:16.435
I need something
to guide the shoelace.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.157
I'm sure you'II tell us.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.310
It means that when I win, you Iose.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.674
And you have Iost.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.273
Hand me that paper clip, will you?

17:24.839 --> 17:27.718
What now?
We're stretching this guy to the Iimit.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.111
--Peter, I shall take special care
of developing your photograph.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.829
Maybe I can appeal
to his sense of justice.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.197
Murdoc, remember,
I did try to help you.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.078
Yes, you did.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.958
It's a Iittle unfair that
a simple bystander

17:42.120 --> 17:44.350
has to become an innocent pawn
in this game.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.230
A monkey wrench and a paper clip?

17:47.400 --> 17:51.279
Yeah. I wanna reverse the direction
of force I'm gonna put on the shoelace.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.589
--isn't usually so dangerous.

17:52.960 --> 17:58.273
But we Iive in difficult times,
and Good Samaritans die young.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.993
If it's any solace,

18:01.160 --> 18:04.516
you will be immortalized in my files,

18:04.680 --> 18:05.999
along with Peter.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.674
You won't be forgotten.
Only, you will be dead.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.318
This camera and the motor drive

18:14.480 --> 18:17.597
are activated by the explosion
when the bazooka fires.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.519
- I'II save these shots for my private...
- Now I get it.

18:20.680 --> 18:25.390
You're replacing the push on the gas
pedal with a pull on that door handle.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.675
You've got it.

18:29.640 --> 18:32.074
Five minutes.
I'II contact you about the pictures Iater.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.798
Yes, sir.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.912
He's gone.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.551
That cuts the odds.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.079
Not enough for my blood.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.629
Look, Iet me try
my idea first, please?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.034
That's nuts.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.278
We're gonna gamble on
a homemade cruise control?

19:04.440 --> 19:06.556
It's scientifically sound.

19:06.720 --> 19:10.429
As I open the door, the shoelace pulls
through the steering wheel,

19:10.600 --> 19:11.953
down to the paper clip.

19:12.160 --> 19:16.119
That reverses the direction of pull
and yanks down the gas pedal.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.475
Cab takes off, we jump out.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.356
Why don't we just
blow them away now.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.750
Murdoc said five minutes,
and that's what they get.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.075
Say when.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.073
Now.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.389
Stay put!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.399
It worked!

19:54.560 --> 19:56.312
How about that.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.593
You're okay, kid.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.188
- What's that?
- Duct tape.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.509
Real handy stuff.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.079
Carry it with me all the time.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.231
Just in case you run into
a bazooka or two?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.677
Or whatever.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.112
Well, I guess I owe you one.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.158
- No, you owe Jack Dalton one.
- Who's he?

20:18.320 --> 20:20.880
Jack Dalton, a friend of mine.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.271
And he owns that--

20:23.600 --> 20:25.431
Owned that vehicle.

20:25.600 --> 20:30.355
So you owe him one taxicab
and one humongous explanation.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.238
What kind of shape is Dalton in?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.992
Couple of broken Iegs.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.596
But he'II be worse when
he hears about his cab.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.756
Hey, MacGyver, just in time.
What does this Iook Iike?

20:53.920 --> 20:56.480
- A Iittle boy's room.
- Wrong-o, the dawn of a new age:

20:56.640 --> 20:59.029
Jack Dalton studies
the science of flight.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.270
Wouldn't "FIy-By-Night" Iook better
on a plane than a cab?

21:01.440 --> 21:02.998
Well, no.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.913
Well, I figured I sell the cab, put the
money down on a new pair of wings.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.389
Before you know it, I'm hiring
stewardesses. This could be big.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.074
Jack, about selling the cab...

21:13.080 --> 21:15.036
This is Mr. Pete Thornton.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.829
A buyer. You read my mind.
Mr. Thornton, have I got a cab for you.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.228
MacGyver's been driving it.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.630
He can testify to what a sweet
road machine you'II be getting.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.153
Yeah.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.913
Listen, what happened to you?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.634
Oh, a Iittle vehicular mishap.
Not in the cab.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.628
Jack roller-skated off the
Santa Monica Pier Iooking at a blond.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.910
Yeah, but I got her number,
and when I get out of here--

21:35.080 --> 21:36.832
But Iet's stick to business,
Mr. Thornton.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.911
Now, we're talking big bucks here,
but she's worth it.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.310
It's a great cab. Sturdy, durable,
can withstand anything.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.471
Not anything.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.795
I'm talking.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.790
Mr. Dalton, I represent a company
which pursues a wide variety of...

21:49.960 --> 21:51.109
pursuits.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.271
I think I hear profits here.
Keep talking.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.989
Well, actually, somebody engaged
in our temporary employ

21:58.160 --> 21:59.559
borrowed your cab.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.070
- Borrowed it?
- Yeah.

22:05.320 --> 22:06.594
You guys don't have it?

22:07.240 --> 22:08.673
Not at the present.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.274
MacGyver, is this true?

22:11.440 --> 22:12.919
Yeah, it's true.

22:14.280 --> 22:15.713
Mr. Thornton,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.519
would you mind if my buddy and I
played a Iittle one-on-one for a minute?

22:18.720 --> 22:20.551
No. Why don't I wait outside.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.994
- What?
- No, I'II be right outside.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.991
Where you going?
You said you'd be here.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.189
MacGyver, this is me.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.397
This is Jack. It's your buddy.
Give it to me straight.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.120
You know how important my
cab is to me. It's my future.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.079
You scratched it, didn't you?

22:37.200 --> 22:39.475
Well, no, not exactly.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.710
Okay, a dent. You put a dent in it.

22:42.240 --> 22:43.719
- Listen, Jack--
- I can Iive with a dent.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.997
- Tell me it's a dent.
- It's a Iittle more than a dent.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.271
Mr. Thornton and I were riding
in your cab, chasing this woman

22:51.440 --> 22:53.158
who was actually a man

22:53.320 --> 22:56.357
who had a guy with a bazooka
waiting and he blew up your cab.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.193
Now, hold it. Run that back.
Run that by me again.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.110
Mr. Thornton and I were
riding in your cab

23:02.280 --> 23:04.510
- and we were chasing this woman--
- No, just the Iast part.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.720
Two guys with bazookas
blew up your cab.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.838
They blew up my cab
with a bazooka?

23:10.160 --> 23:11.479
Two bazookas.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.634
But I can explain.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.517
Bazookas?
You can explain bazookas?

23:20.680 --> 23:22.318
You cannot explain bazookas!

23:25.000 --> 23:26.433
Jack?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.397
- You all right?
- My arm!

23:29.960 --> 23:31.678
Well, what happened?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.876
- What did you say to him?
- My arm.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.111
Doctor says with a Iittle Iuck,
Jack's busted arm

23:36.280 --> 23:39.078
ought to be healed
by the time he can walk again.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.231
Well, I bet that didn't exactly
cheer him up.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.836
Listen, I called the office. You give us
the ownership and registration papers,

23:45.000 --> 23:46.194
we'II pay for the cab.

23:46.360 --> 23:48.112
AII right. AII papers are
back at Jack's place.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.918
I'm staying there while he's Iaid up.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.789
You should be able to keep using that
apartment at Ieast for another month.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.709
He's got an apartment
in an office building?

23:57.880 --> 24:01.156
Not exactly in it. Under it.

24:01.960 --> 24:05.714
Not much of a view, but it's quiet
and the neighbours don't bother you.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.518
It's kind of homey.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.955
Homey? It's a dungeon.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.032
You call this an apartment?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.553
Well, yeah, sort of.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.473
See, Jack rented some storage space
for his truck a few years ago

24:16.640 --> 24:18.870
and he's kind of
expanded his territory.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.793
He is not a neat person.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.554
No, but he's a good friend.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.718
And I figure I can clean the place up
a Iittle bit when I get some spare time.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.996
You mean when you're
not driving his cab.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.038
Yeah.
Let me get those papers for you.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.191
You are a do-gooder, MacGyver.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.636
Ninety percent of the people
in the world are smart.

24:37.800 --> 24:40.030
They see trouble coming,
they duck and run.

24:40.200 --> 24:44.671
Ten percent are Iike you.
Can't resist cleaning up the mess.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.672
Here are those papers.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.674
- Don't move.
- So how Iong you figure it'II be--?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.918
Why? What? What?

24:54.120 --> 24:56.759
Didn't you hear a click?
When you sat down?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.357
That click.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.719
Like the kind you hear before:

25:10.040 --> 25:13.874
It's probably a Iow-powered
charge specially designed.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.076
It's only gonna destroy the bed.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.313
What about the guy on it?

25:19.040 --> 25:21.031
Yeah, that too.

25:25.360 --> 25:29.194
Oh, boy. Nice job.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.159
Very clever.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.076
Any attempt to defuse it
is gonna blow it.

25:35.240 --> 25:36.719
Will you stop that?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.791
It's nice to hear all this
professional appreciation,

25:38.960 --> 25:40.518
but I happen to be the target!

25:40.680 --> 25:43.797
Easy. Stay cool, MacGyver.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.791
The important thing to remember

25:45.960 --> 25:48.155
is that with a charge Iike this,

25:48.320 --> 25:52.393
it blows almost completely
straight up.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.632
AII right,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.711
give me your hand.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.276
- Give me your hand.
- It's coming.

26:07.840 --> 26:08.829
Now.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.832
Now!

26:17.160 --> 26:18.559
You all right?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.312
Fine.

26:21.320 --> 26:24.869
Murdoc won't be happy when he
finds out he only blew up the bed.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.235
Neither will Jack.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.509
What is it?

26:32.520 --> 26:34.192
What's the matter?

26:37.160 --> 26:39.594
Guess it went a Iittle sideways, huh?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.716
Yeah. Thanks.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.950
Suppose that comes in pretty handy
in your Iine of work,

26:44.120 --> 26:46.076
what with disguises and stuff.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.151
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.756
Listen, MacGyver,
anybody who can use

26:52.920 --> 26:55.514
a paper clip, a pair of shoelaces
and a rusty monkey wrench

26:55.680 --> 26:57.671
to take out two bazookas

26:57.840 --> 26:59.876
could be very useful

27:00.040 --> 27:01.951
in taking Murdoc.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.109
Help me.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.314
- You're serious, aren't you?
- Yeah.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.359
Forget it.

27:09.520 --> 27:13.308
The taxi ride was it.
I quit the volunteer business.

27:13.480 --> 27:18.600
MacGyver, he is going
to try to kill you either way.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.799
Now, you cooperate,
and maybe we'II take him.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.913
What do you say?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.831
Partners.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.233
We're making extraordinarily
good time, gentlemen.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.033
I'd say halfway home.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.958
He's really full of himself, isn't he?

27:57.120 --> 28:00.430
Well, he was confident
seven years ago too.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.113
Good point.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.311
Found something.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.276
Oh, yeah.
Spare pantyhose for when he's Sara.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.557
Well, hang on to them.
They might come in handy.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.278
They're not my size.

28:17.440 --> 28:21.035
Well, if this engine runs at all,
we'II have a power source.

28:21.920 --> 28:26.630
But with no engine,
I guess we don't.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.870
No, we don't.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.237
I am getting bored with this box.

28:32.400 --> 28:35.517
You know, I remember negotiating
with Jack about the price of his cab.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.148
Right now I would give everything
I own for an engine in this one

28:38.320 --> 28:40.470
so we could crash out of this place!

28:40.640 --> 28:44.599
Hey, Pete, Pete, come on, come on.
Take it easy, guy, take it easy.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.239
Come on.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.955
I know you don't Iike
to be cooped up Iike this,

28:49.400 --> 28:52.153
but we're gonna get out.
I promise you.

28:53.760 --> 28:56.320
Of course, then we're gonna
have to tell Jack the whole story,

28:56.480 --> 28:58.755
Iike we did seven years ago.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.713
Remember what that was Iike?

29:00.880 --> 29:02.711
You gonna pay for my cab?

29:02.880 --> 29:04.711
Full current value.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.190
- Let's remember, it's a vehicle that is--
- Unique.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.910
Custom interior. Do you know
what a custom paint job costs?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.275
Well, I'II tell you. Eighteen coats,
hand-rubbed Iacquer.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.079
The base paint, metallic. The best.
A new engine.

29:17.240 --> 29:18.639
Jack...

29:19.120 --> 29:20.872
...I repainted your cab.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.235
He's got honesty the way
some people have diseases.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.277
- Incurable.
- Yeah, he does.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.874
That's why he made us promise
to pay for your cab.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.792
- What about my fuzzy dice?
- Everything.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.598
They're gonna pay
for everything, Jack.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.990
- Including the bed.
- Good.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.038
Bed?

29:40.160 --> 29:41.832
- Bed? What bed?
- Your bed.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.468
The one in your apartment.
Murdoc rigged it.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.790
See, when I sat on your bed,
it blew up.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.032
My bed blew up?

29:50.480 --> 29:52.277
He blew up my bed?

29:53.120 --> 29:54.792
Well, who is this guy?
Why is he after me?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.839
- You're taking this pretty hard.
- How should I take it, Iying down?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.433
MacGyver, you gotta get
me out of here.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.556
I'm in a bed.
This could blow up any second.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.393
Mr. Dalton, you are much better off
here than on the outside.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.393
Besides, Murdoc doesn't want you.
He's after MacGyver.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.710
He can have him.
I hang around with you anymore,

30:10.880 --> 30:14.031
this guy Murdoc'II total my apartment.
I'II be sleeping at the Midnight Mission.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.393
- Kind of bitter, aren't you?
- Me?

30:17.560 --> 30:19.994
Oh, no. This is
the best day of my Iife.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.559
Probably the Iast.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.758
I've brought you a treat, Mr. Dalton.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.911
Jell-O and chocolate pudding.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.073
If you're a good boy
and take all your pills, I'II call

30:30.240 --> 30:33.755
the orderly and order a nice,
Iong sponge bath. Now...

30:41.640 --> 30:44.313
PIease!
I've only got one arm Ieft!

31:23.840 --> 31:25.671
I've checked Harbison Street
and all the alleys.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.909
AII clear this side.

31:27.520 --> 31:28.919
Roger, Lincoln 42.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.275
Blasting process starting now.
Maintain radio silence.

31:31.440 --> 31:33.396
Lincoln 42, roger.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.120
Hey, you!
This is a demolition zone!

31:36.280 --> 31:38.635
They're gonna blow that building!

31:44.000 --> 31:46.036
- What's going on?
- Some nut just ran into the building.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.760
They're gonna blow it.
I'II try and stop them.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.558
Get back.

31:50.880 --> 31:54.236
Come on. Come on!

32:18.720 --> 32:21.632
Do you remember the day you forced
me into the demolition zone?

32:21.960 --> 32:22.995
Do you remember?

32:23.160 --> 32:24.639
Well, if you don't, don't worry.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.313
You're going to experience it.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.357
You know, I worked on
Murdoc's file for a Iong time

32:28.520 --> 32:30.238
before I finally caught up with him.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.470
We should've checked
that building seven years ago.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.313
- Pete, it was checked.
- We should have checked it!

32:42.640 --> 32:44.039
We're off the pavement.

33:16.320 --> 33:18.197
Sounds Iike he's
unhitching the trailer.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.191
I know you've had a long, dull ride,
but it's over.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.679
Come on.
We gotta think of something.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.230
- We gotta think of something.
- I'm thinking, Pete, I'm thinking.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.391
Slightly curious, gentlemen?

34:34.639 --> 34:38.155
Shut up. Shut up, shut up!

34:38.320 --> 34:40.788
Be patient. I was.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.835
That was a dumb thing to do,
wasn't it?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.353
Maybe.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.590
Think you'd feel any better?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.149
Yeah, I do.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.999
Done.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.357
Last stop, gentlemen,
and Iast chance.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.795
So I shall be crystal clear.

35:55.280 --> 35:59.637
I've just packed 12 pounds
of dynamite on and beneath you.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.916
Enough to blow, say, a--

36:02.080 --> 36:03.832
A good-sized building.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.515
And more than enough
for a truck trailer.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.718
So now's your time to make peace.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.711
T o be precise...

36:17.480 --> 36:18.799
...seven minutes.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.439
To hell.

36:45.080 --> 36:48.550
- Not a Iot of time.
- No, not a Iot. Hold this, will you?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.198
Any ideas?

36:57.800 --> 37:00.314
Well, nothing solid yet.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.991
Why are you smiling Iike that?

37:20.160 --> 37:21.878
I know that Iook.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.474
I've never been able to figure out
how your mind works,

37:24.640 --> 37:26.232
but I know when it works.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.834
Yeah, great.
An old oilcan, an old car,

37:45.000 --> 37:48.231
an old pair of pantyhose
and an old battery.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.799
I know I'm happy.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.520
Don't forget the exhaust pipe.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.109
My cup runneth over.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.551
Well, the exhaust is rusty iron,

37:58.720 --> 38:03.271
that oilcan is aluminium and that
battery's still got some acid in it.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.149
- How could I forget that?
- Give me a hand, will you?

38:13.440 --> 38:15.032
Pull on it.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.909
You have two and a half minutes
and counting.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.874
Time to make peace
with yourselves.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.598
It's your last chance.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.512
- Still got those pantyhose?
- Yeah, right here.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.399
I want you to soak them in oil.
It's a key part of our plan.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.279
PIan? I wasn't sure we had a plan.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.000
- Reassure me, will you?
- Pantyhose, soak them.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.116
You know what I'm thinking about?

38:40.280 --> 38:43.192
A paper clip,
a pair of shoelaces,

38:43.360 --> 38:46.511
two pros with bazookas
who bit the dust.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.240
So I do have a measure of faith.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.318
- You better hustle, Pete.
- Yeah.

39:04.280 --> 39:10.230
1:43 to go.
It will be a memorable photograph.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.952
Do I wanna know
what it is we're making?

39:13.120 --> 39:14.758
A sort of a bomb.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.480
- How big a bomb?
- A pretty good one.

39:17.640 --> 39:19.995
See, the ferrous oxide
and the aluminium shavings

39:20.160 --> 39:22.515
should generate enough heat
to explode the battery.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.272
And when it blows,
it sets off the dynamite

39:24.440 --> 39:27.000
that Murdoc put under the trailer.
You know what we'II be?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.632
- Acid rain.
- No.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.949
Dynamite's stable.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.272
Usually.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.278
It's all we got, Pete.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.713
AII right, Pete, Iet's go!

39:42.760 --> 39:45.149
- We're gonna need our fuse now.
- Yeah.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.228
The old duct tape, huh?

39:54.400 --> 39:56.197
Never Ieave home without it.

39:59.720 --> 40:00.709
Forty-eight seconds.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.840
Pete, I don't know what's gonna
happen here, so you better take cover.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.194
It's gonna work.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.793
- Still...
- Yeah.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.598
Yeah.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.475
No!

41:22.160 --> 41:24.037
He's got dynamite! It's gonna blow!

41:42.880 --> 41:44.438
He's dead.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.238
He could have gotten out.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.833
There was time.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.637
The whole thing blew up, he's dead.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.472
Maybe.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.518
I've got a bump on my head from when
we went out the back of the trailer.

42:11.680 --> 42:13.272
It still hurts.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.352
Well, I haven't got much
insulation up there.

42:16.520 --> 42:19.557
Yeah, Pete, I remember when
you used to wear a hairpiece.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.392
Why'd you stop wearing that?

42:21.560 --> 42:24.632
I grew out of it.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.199
Hey, guys!

42:32.000 --> 42:33.638
Hey.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.754
That's how I felt when
I got my first Dear John Ietter.

42:41.920 --> 42:45.310
- Hey, I'm sorry. I apologize.
- For what?

42:46.400 --> 42:47.913
I got your note, but, hey,

42:48.080 --> 42:49.593
me get up at sunrise
on a Sunday morning

42:49.760 --> 42:51.990
to come to a reunion at a junkyard?

42:52.160 --> 42:53.878
You got a note to come out here?

42:54.040 --> 42:55.519
Come on, Pete, you sent it.

42:56.320 --> 42:59.198
Anyway, it took me forever
to find the Iilies

42:59.360 --> 43:02.796
you asked for. After I woke up,
around noon or a Iittle Iater.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.076
The idea sounds Iike a kick.
Where's the party?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.798
Actually, it's over.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.752
You mean you guys have
been sitting around waiting

43:09.920 --> 43:10.955
since 8:00 this morning?

43:11.320 --> 43:14.630
No, no, not all that time. We...

43:14.800 --> 43:16.631
We went on a field trip with a friend.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.597
Well, I'd Iike to hear all about it,
but first...

43:21.080 --> 43:24.117
Well, I may have missed all the fun,
but I want a picture for old time's sake.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.113
Remember who brought us together in
the first place? That maniac Murdoc?

43:27.280 --> 43:28.793
Dead and buried these seven years.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.075
Hold it. Here it comes.
