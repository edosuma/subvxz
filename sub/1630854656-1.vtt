WEBVTT

00:17.365 --> 00:19.497
It's a medium, God damn it.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.502
It ain't gonna fit me.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.725
-Look at that.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.423
Oh, it's exactly--

00:32.467 --> 00:34.382
It's exactly what I have,
but it's a medium,

00:34.425 --> 00:36.079
I don't think
it's gonna fit.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.212
-You need a large?
-Yeah, minimum.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.260
I can't wear a shirt
unless it has a stain on it.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.610
If you wear a shirt that
doesn't have a stain on it,

00:45.654 --> 00:46.742
it's not a shirt.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.313
One of the biggest problems
I have is my memory.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.317
I just wanna forget everything.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.450
Unfortunately, I can't.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.541
-You raised her--
-The past haunts me.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.416
Do these animals
deserve the same protections

01:08.459 --> 01:11.288
given to other species?

01:11.332 --> 01:13.508
Or should they just
be left to die?

01:17.729 --> 01:19.340
These creatures
were here before us.

01:22.299 --> 01:24.649
I guess Netflix
is doing the thing on Jurassic.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.349
They want to hear
the real story.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.917
Not a revisionist history
version.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.096
We're in "C" Theater

01:36.139 --> 01:39.838
at 3210 Kerner Boulevard,
San Rafael, California,

01:39.882 --> 01:41.318
the old ILM facility.

01:42.798 --> 01:44.365
In this theater
is where we projected

01:44.408 --> 01:46.323
every single one of the shots

01:46.367 --> 01:47.977
that we knew was gonna change
the entire film industry.

01:53.765 --> 01:57.160
When the T-Rex took a step,
you had a secondary jiggle.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.336
So, I had separate channels
of animation

01:59.380 --> 02:01.295
of literally
a digital bladder

02:01.730 --> 02:03.514
hung off
the hierarchy of the leg,

02:03.558 --> 02:05.386
so it shook on the bone.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.083
So, if the bladder shook,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.607
the outside control vertices
shook as well.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.261
So, every time
the Rex took a step,

02:11.305 --> 02:13.307
you had to have
a massive amount of shake

02:13.350 --> 02:15.004
of this muscle.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.527
A lot of people
are always referring back to it

02:16.571 --> 02:18.616
being the best
of all the Jurassics.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.922
And now, what is it?

02:19.965 --> 02:21.750
World domination
of everything--

02:21.793 --> 02:23.882
I mean the "Giganotosaurus",
that's the latest one.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.710
It was like three times
the size of the Rex.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.017
"It is?
Oh, I better go see the sequel."

02:28.060 --> 02:30.715
Why don't they just merge
Star Wars and Jurassic
together

02:30.759 --> 02:32.761
and come up
with one big mega movie?

02:32.804 --> 02:34.632
You know,
it's like dinosaurs in space

02:34.676 --> 02:36.286
and everyone's shooting
each other, you know?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.555
I'm naive, I guess,

02:44.599 --> 02:45.948
when it comes
to a lot of stuff.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.170
And you get burned, y'know.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.390
You get burned.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.179
Things are so simple now,
right?

03:01.877 --> 03:03.400
Looking back
at the ILM days,

03:03.444 --> 03:05.359
it's almost like
it was a weird dream.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.278
Even though I was using
machines as a tool back then,

03:12.453 --> 03:14.281
I myself
was stuck in a machine.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.198
And this whole thing
about blind curiosity,

03:18.241 --> 03:19.677
trying to, A,
prove it yourself,

03:19.721 --> 03:21.375
and B, you know,

03:21.418 --> 03:23.768
prove it to the world,
you can do something.

03:23.812 --> 03:24.900
Little did I know...

03:26.162 --> 03:27.555
y'know, I created a monster.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.603
And joining me now
in the studio

03:32.647 --> 03:34.779
is the chief animator
at Lucasfilm, Steve Williams.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.260
George Lucas' Industrial Light
and Magic Company,

03:37.304 --> 03:39.044
the folks who provided
special effects

03:39.088 --> 03:40.916
for Star Wars,
is going commercial.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.918
These hummingbirds
are not real.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.703
Animator Steve Williams
sketches out a line drawing

03:45.747 --> 03:47.662
on a computer screen.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.446
It was never
Steve's intention to combine

03:49.490 --> 03:51.709
his classical animation
training with computers,

03:51.753 --> 03:53.842
but now colleagues marvel,

03:53.885 --> 03:56.279
they've never seen anyone
create life so realistically.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.325
It was not biotechnology

03:58.368 --> 04:01.241
that brought the dinosaurs
to life inJurassic Park.

04:01.284 --> 04:03.025
Animator Steve Williams

04:03.068 --> 04:05.288
used a computer
to bring the T-Rex to life.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.290
The Universal Studios picture

04:07.334 --> 04:09.901
could generate as much
as $50 million this weekend.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.686
Other studios
in town will not open

04:11.729 --> 04:13.514
any of their pictures
against it.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.211
Williams
is one of the hottest

04:15.255 --> 04:16.778
computer animators
in Hollywood.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.432
Spreading his message

04:18.475 --> 04:19.694
that computer animation
is about art,

04:19.737 --> 04:21.086
not technology.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.004
I mean, is there anything
that worries you about this?

04:26.048 --> 04:27.963
Oh, yeah,
I-- I think it's pretty--

04:28.006 --> 04:29.921
I-- I don't think
it's a good thing, but it's--

04:29.965 --> 04:31.488
Well, so, you're sort of
like Dr. Frankenstein.

04:43.021 --> 04:45.894
Everybody thinks that
chaos is completely random.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.071
There is no such thing
as random.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.596
Every single variable
is calculatable.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.947
And math
is nothing but a language

04:55.991 --> 04:58.994
to try and describe
what nature already knows.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.955
We're so steeped
in the rules...

05:05.522 --> 05:08.960
so when you think differently,
you're seen as a heretic.

05:09.004 --> 05:14.052
♪

05:22.409 --> 05:24.628
I know I was different,
you know, I-- I knew it.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.065
I've always been different.

05:29.024 --> 05:32.027
I had visions about
how things are gonna be...

05:33.245 --> 05:35.683
and not should be,
but just are going to be.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.774
Especially about,
you know, synthetic imagery.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.168
Here's a low-resolution data
of the T-Rex,

05:43.212 --> 05:44.735
and most of these points here

05:44.779 --> 05:46.607
where each one
of the bones were.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.130
Jurassic Park storyboards.

05:48.739 --> 05:51.742
"SS approved" means
Steven Spielberg approved.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.614
Chase scene four.

05:53.657 --> 05:55.572
75 frames. Took me four months
to animate this shot.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.490
Here's somebody
that was fundamental

06:00.534 --> 06:03.580
at that time,
in-- in, uh, the-- the,

06:03.624 --> 06:07.497
um, progress of this
disruptive technology.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.587
But, the way
that I know him now,

06:10.631 --> 06:12.328
he mainly likes to blacksmith,

06:12.372 --> 06:13.982
and we end up hanging out
in the shop

06:14.025 --> 06:16.506
because he likes
to get his hands dirty,

06:16.550 --> 06:17.638
just like I do.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.814
We all called him Spaz.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.469
Now, calling
Steve Williams "Spaz,"

06:22.512 --> 06:24.645
was, uh, a nickname,

06:24.688 --> 06:27.648
like, that giant guy
in high school

06:27.691 --> 06:29.780
that everybody called Tiny.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.782
Hey, Spaz,
my, how you doing, buddy?

06:31.826 --> 06:35.177
That character
with the pocket protector

06:35.220 --> 06:38.485
and the thick glasses,
he was the opposite.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.358
Here was a motorcycle-riding,

06:42.402 --> 06:45.317
leather-jacket-wearing guy,

06:45.361 --> 06:47.189
who's the first one
that I ever met,

06:47.232 --> 06:48.320
that was an artist,

06:48.364 --> 06:49.974
who had computer

06:50.018 --> 06:52.412
and high-mathematical skills.

06:53.369 --> 06:57.155
Like Michelangelo took corpses
and dissected them,

06:57.199 --> 07:01.203
Spaz is a guy who kind of
dissected life a little bit.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.379
I was just amazed
by how things worked.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.773
My whole life I was driven by
how things work.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.429
Cartoons deviated
from the rules

07:09.472 --> 07:11.039
of the way nature operates.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.650
It was sort of
questioning convention.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.784
-You're questioning reality.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.612
Good he's got that
going for me.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.135
Got that going at me.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.441
Sheridan College
in Toronto.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.660
All of us are misfits.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.446
We didn't think
conventionally.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.404
We're these, like,
these strange artists.

07:28.970 --> 07:31.407
I decided to take
classical animation.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.409
Then, I took
computer engineering,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.019
University of Toronto.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.326
Then I joined a company
in Toronto called Alias,

07:37.369 --> 07:39.676
using computers
to do animation.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.504
No one really thought about it
that way.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.550
They thought it
for data processing,

07:43.593 --> 07:44.681
they didn't really
think about it

07:44.725 --> 07:45.900
for actually animating.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.816
I was attempting to try
and replicate the real world

07:48.859 --> 07:50.295
in a synthetic environment.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.211
There were very few people
in the world that knew Alias,

07:53.255 --> 07:55.910
three-dimensional
computer graphics back in 1988.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.652
I was working on a system
called the "CIWS,"

07:58.695 --> 08:00.828
it was a Gatling gun that,
for the most part,

08:00.871 --> 08:02.743
sat on Iowa-class
battleships.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.180
The simulation
I was working,

08:05.223 --> 08:06.964
had the fluorocarbon
cooling system.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.793
ILM,
Industrial Light Magic,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.621
got wind
that there was somebody

08:11.665 --> 08:13.231
that actually knew something
about fluid dynamics.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.973
They're working on a movie

08:16.017 --> 08:18.280
where there's a water creature.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.108
Now, you see
water doing things

08:20.151 --> 08:22.502
all the time,
but back in the day,

08:22.545 --> 08:24.547
you said, "Well, it's gonna be
water that comes alive,

08:24.591 --> 08:26.418
and then the face
comes out of the water."

08:27.245 --> 08:28.508
People would just blank out.

08:29.726 --> 08:32.381
It was a big question mark
for everybody.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.426
What Jim had seen
in computer graphics

08:34.470 --> 08:35.819
up to that point,

08:35.863 --> 08:37.299
was all the other
prior films

08:37.342 --> 08:38.909
that had used
computer graphics,

08:38.953 --> 08:40.563
like Last Starfighter,
and Tron,

08:40.607 --> 08:42.304
and even
Young Sherlock Holmes.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.263
CG had
an artificiality to it.

08:46.351 --> 08:49.659
We were looking
for a photo-real thing.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.096
His previous films,
Terminatorand Aliens,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.925
they were about
thrills and action.

08:56.797 --> 09:00.278
They were not about just
a straight sense of wonder.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.368
He really wanted to
show that he could do that.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.459
We clearly needed
additional talent

09:07.503 --> 09:10.027
and we found
Steve Williams.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.118
The quality was paramount.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.772
If we were gonna be successful,

09:15.816 --> 09:18.079
this stuff had to be
not just good enough,

09:18.122 --> 09:20.429
it had to be great,
it had to be convincing,

09:20.472 --> 09:22.039
it had to be something

09:22.083 --> 09:25.216
that ultimately
no one had ever seen before.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.480
So I ended up
at Industrial Light Magic,

09:28.524 --> 09:31.614
and I got hired
in October of 1988

09:31.658 --> 09:33.529
to be Chief Animator
on The Abyss.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
We had two machines,

09:36.401 --> 09:39.187
Silicon Graphics GT60
and a GT80.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.276
The first thing I had to do

09:41.319 --> 09:43.670
was figure out
how to animate the spine

09:43.713 --> 09:44.801
of the pseudopod.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.282
"The Water Weenie"
was the nickname.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.414
Everyone's looking at us.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.721
If we fail,

09:51.765 --> 09:53.070
it would have been
a tremendous setback.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.379
I was the first Ph.D.
at ILM

09:57.422 --> 09:59.120
in the subject
of computer graphics.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.731
We didn't have
a lot office space,

10:01.775 --> 10:03.864
but I got put in this thing
called "The Pit,"

10:04.995 --> 10:06.867
which was downstairs
and was a sound room.

10:06.910 --> 10:09.565
And we turned it into this
kind of wild, wacky office.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.612
Spaz was put down there too.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.485
My first impression,
he walks in,

10:16.528 --> 10:19.009
he's got, like,
a tight, white t-shirt,

10:19.053 --> 10:20.924
crew cut,
Dudley Do-Right chin,

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
old school jeans
rolled up at the bottom,

10:22.665 --> 10:23.797
and wearing engineer boots.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.452
It-- it's, like,
a '50s biker thing

10:27.496 --> 10:29.498
or, you know,
this kind of strange,

10:29.541 --> 10:31.326
macho Canadian thing
or who knows what.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.110
There's this fucking
hippie and I'm thinking,

10:33.154 --> 10:34.721
"Ah, God damned fucking hippie,

10:34.764 --> 10:37.462
God damned Californian,"
you know?

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
And he's got his feet
on the desk

10:38.855 --> 10:40.814
and playing on the stereo

10:40.857 --> 10:43.120
Alice Cooper,
"Love it to Death."

10:43.164 --> 10:46.733
That's the first fucking
album I ever had and he goes,

10:46.776 --> 10:48.299
"That's the first album
I ever had."

10:48.343 --> 10:50.084
And that was it. Game over.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.477
We hit it off right away.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.131
I mean, it's funny, even though
we're very different,

10:54.175 --> 10:55.480
we like to have fun.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.527
Have fun, be fun.
That was our motto.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.138
We were outsiders,

11:01.182 --> 11:04.098
only because we had this
technical animation solution,

11:04.141 --> 11:05.708
but we hadn't really worked
on films.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.493
My job, you know,

11:08.537 --> 11:10.234
was to try and figure out
the nuance of the animation.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.542
Mark had come up
with this code

11:13.585 --> 11:15.762
that allowed us to put
little sine wave distributions

11:15.805 --> 11:17.546
over the surface
to create a rippling effect.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.288
How to take surfaces
and make them undulate

11:20.331 --> 11:21.942
like they're water,
even though they're tubes,

11:21.985 --> 11:23.683
that was a big pain in the ass.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.120
We had to just find solutions.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.123
Jim sent us back scans

11:29.166 --> 11:31.038
with the video we had

11:31.081 --> 11:33.649
just drawing on it
with a marker, he faxed them.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.260
Ultimately,
we were able to accomplish

11:36.304 --> 11:37.914
what Jim was looking for.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.961
Cameron had said,
had that scene failed,

11:41.004 --> 11:42.919
he would've just yanked it
from the entire film.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.400
But it ended being
one of the premiere scenes.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.054
Everybody looked at it
and went,

11:47.097 --> 11:48.708
"How in blazes was that done?"

11:49.360 --> 11:50.710
And that's
where the deal changed.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.019
I knew darn well
this would be the best

11:56.063 --> 11:57.542
that I would ever do.

11:57.586 --> 11:58.630
Ever.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.416
I just knew
that there wasn't gonna be

12:01.459 --> 12:03.331
any more creative hurdles,

12:03.374 --> 12:05.725
there wouldn't be anything
like what we were doing at ILM.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.904
When you grow up in Canada,
it's like...

12:12.644 --> 12:15.299
you grow up
with eight colors, okay?

12:16.431 --> 12:19.477
So, you have to learn
how to design and draw,

12:19.521 --> 12:20.914
and paint
with these eight colors.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.567
When you come to the States,

12:22.611 --> 12:24.308
you're instantly,
across the border,

12:24.352 --> 12:25.788
given 20 colors.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.796
It blows your bloody mind.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.799
You can have a '65 Cadillac
without any rust on it.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.236
Engines, gas,

12:39.280 --> 12:42.718
bullets, beer, everything,
just like that, snap.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.372
Everything's
a half an hour away.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.374
It's great.
It's like being in Disneyland.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.117
One, one gun,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.644
In America,
anybody can do anything.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.734
All you have to do
is put in the dedication

12:58.778 --> 13:00.301
and the sweat,

13:00.344 --> 13:01.563
and you can get
whatever you fucking want.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.827
That concept
didn't exist in Canada.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.699
Growing up in Toronto,

13:09.397 --> 13:11.007
you're growing up
in suppression.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.967
You're growing up
in bureaucracy.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.144
You are not qualified
to do this.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.799
The prime minister
at the time

13:19.842 --> 13:21.017
was a guy named
Pierre Trudeau.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.063
And Pierre Trudeau said,

13:23.106 --> 13:24.151
"If you don't like it here
in Canada,

13:24.194 --> 13:25.630
move somewhere else."

13:25.674 --> 13:27.589
So, I said,
"Okay, fine. I'm gonna."

13:28.111 --> 13:29.199
And I did.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.334
So, this is
the original mousepad

13:33.377 --> 13:36.424
that I used
to build Terminator 2.

13:37.599 --> 13:41.081
I was there so much
I ended up wearing out the pad.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.648
Pretty funny, eh?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.262
The pseudopod sequence
was a validation

13:48.305 --> 13:50.699
that this was a technique
that had a lot of promise.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.572
But it took Jim Cameron
on his next film,

13:54.616 --> 13:57.227
Terminator 2, to kind of
take it to the next step

13:57.271 --> 13:59.229
of what you could do
with it.

14:04.278 --> 14:07.716
The Abyss encouraged me
to take it a step further,

14:07.759 --> 14:09.022
or many steps further.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.980
He knew to try and push it.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.113
And that was the good thing
about Cameron, he pushed it.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.766
He believed in it,

14:14.810 --> 14:16.333
even though he didn't know
the technology

14:16.377 --> 14:18.814
or the technique
and he let myself and Spaz

14:18.858 --> 14:20.468
and everyone run with it.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.474
Everyone's neck
was on the line, including his.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.043
The biggest
technical challenge

14:30.086 --> 14:33.176
was building a human in data,
it hadn't been done before.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.092
Robert Patrick
is the T-1000.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.615
We're gonna study his body,

14:37.659 --> 14:39.269
we're gonna watch
his movements,

14:39.313 --> 14:41.576
we're gonna find a way
to capture his quality.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.057
There was
no motion capture back then.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.146
So, Mark and I thought

14:46.189 --> 14:48.452
"Okay, well, let's do
what Muybridge had done."

14:48.496 --> 14:51.586
Put a grid,
but not on the background.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.588
Put a grid on the guy.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.417
The day I got cast,

14:56.460 --> 14:59.942
I'm flown
to wherever the hell ILM is.

15:00.769 --> 15:04.773
Spaz and Mark start to paint
these grids over me...

15:06.340 --> 15:08.908
and I had no idea
what the fuck they were doing.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.388
Pardon my language, but,
you know, they're animators,

15:11.432 --> 15:13.086
I don't know
what they're doing, but they--

15:13.129 --> 15:14.826
they seem real interested
in what I'm doing.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.177
All right,
oh, man, oh, man.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.614
-I'm one of the biggest--
-No, no, you're not.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.877
Yes, I am.
I could have been a T-1000.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.184
You can only pray
to have lines like that.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
I think
that's the only time

15:26.055 --> 15:27.665
I ever seen you with a smile,
Robert, huh?

15:27.709 --> 15:29.972
He's out of character.

15:30.016 --> 15:33.149
Mark and Steve
were so inquisitive

15:33.193 --> 15:34.977
about what was I thinking,

15:35.021 --> 15:37.197
where was I getting
these ideas?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.894
If you're my target now,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.940
my left leg and my hip
would drop back,

15:40.983 --> 15:43.246
my hip would lead me,
and then the target's there.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.987
Gotcha.

15:45.031 --> 15:45.901
Immediately,
it clicked with that.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.556
We had, like,
our own theory,

15:48.599 --> 15:51.428
our own T-1000 talk,
our own jargon.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.736
And they were kinda close
to my age.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.651
And I could tell
they were young and eager,

15:56.694 --> 15:59.697
trying to make a name
for themselves as well.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.746
We were all
pretty passionate.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.183
And I remember thinking,

16:07.227 --> 16:09.098
"T-2 man,
it's a whole 'nother level up."

16:10.447 --> 16:12.058
The walk out of the fire,

16:12.972 --> 16:16.279
the first unveiling
of the special powers

16:16.323 --> 16:17.977
the T-1000 had.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.416
The first take I did,
I went in there

16:22.459 --> 16:24.026
and I could smell
my shirt burning.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.897
And I could feel it
on the back of my ears.

16:25.941 --> 16:27.508
My ears were getting singed.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.553
The first shot I had to do

16:29.597 --> 16:31.381
was CC1
walking out of the fire.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.296
There was 375 frames long,

16:33.340 --> 16:35.472
fully skin walking T-1000.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.735
I remember shooting that,

16:37.779 --> 16:39.259
and I remember
everybody being frustrated.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
I remember me
being very frustrated,

16:41.304 --> 16:43.002
because I thought
I was fucking it up

16:43.045 --> 16:44.960
for everybody.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
I think we did like 27 takes
or something, I don't know.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.530
I do remember that day,

16:49.573 --> 16:52.489
Jim and I sitting somewhere
in that canal,

16:52.533 --> 16:53.925
off to the side
in the shade.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.016
I think he could sense
at how frustrated I was

16:58.321 --> 17:02.195
and he said, "Hey, man,
this has never been done.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.198
We're making movie history.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.418
This is history right now."

17:10.464 --> 17:11.900
At ILM,

17:11.943 --> 17:13.119
we shot all this
great reference material

17:13.162 --> 17:14.294
of Robert Patrick walking.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.993
I'd come up with a method
to actually build the T-1000.

17:18.472 --> 17:19.690
Okay, ready to roll camera?

17:20.430 --> 17:22.302
All right,
roll "B" camera.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.433
Action!

17:24.565 --> 17:26.219
I started with a set of bones.

17:27.089 --> 17:31.050
Spaz, he actually
animated my skeletal system.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.098
So it operates
like any standard puppet,

17:36.142 --> 17:37.752
it's got 30 channels to it

17:37.795 --> 17:39.623
that go from anywhere
from controlling

17:39.667 --> 17:41.451
the speed of his legs

17:41.495 --> 17:43.236
to the speed
of what his fingers are doing.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.933
This is really
the first successful step

17:44.976 --> 17:46.804
to adding real life

17:46.848 --> 17:49.416
to an otherwise inanimate
piece of geometry.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.418
We are destined to do that
or nothing.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.811
We knew that other people
had come so far,

17:53.855 --> 17:55.683
we wanted to go beyond that.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.425
Once that shot happened,
that was it.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.557
Everybody knew.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.865
That was a new beginning.

18:05.649 --> 18:06.998
ILM was evolving.

18:08.391 --> 18:12.613
If you're lucky,
you will find a place to go

18:12.656 --> 18:15.746
where they will continue
to subsidize your insanity.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.488
Stories that wanted to be told
ten years ago

18:18.532 --> 18:20.490
couldn't really be told

18:20.534 --> 18:22.449
because there was limitations
in the effects industry.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.407
You know, so...

18:24.451 --> 18:26.583
Every time we did something
that became better and digital,

18:26.627 --> 18:29.369
more experts moved in,
that we'd never seen before.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.675
More managers moved in.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.591
More people to tell you
what you were doing wrong,

18:34.635 --> 18:35.723
even though
they didn't even understand

18:35.766 --> 18:36.854
what you were doing.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.857
Many folks,
particularly in the beginning,

18:39.901 --> 18:42.599
didn't embrace it,
nor did they feel, like,

18:42.643 --> 18:45.167
they had the capability
to embrace it.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.691
You didn't want
to lose your job

18:47.735 --> 18:49.302
to anything that was new.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.435
Right away, we knew,
"This is coming."

18:53.044 --> 18:54.785
A lot of people
were terrified by it,

18:54.829 --> 18:56.744
"It's gonna put model makers
out of work."

18:56.787 --> 18:58.789
It was a live conversation
happening all the time

18:58.833 --> 18:59.834
'cause it was a threat.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.184
That's how we saw it.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.839
So not only did they not want
to embrace them,

19:04.882 --> 19:06.928
they actually
wanted to see them fail,

19:06.971 --> 19:08.147
in my opinion.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.498
But, this was the future.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.282
And I just started
buying gear.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.154
Throwing money into digital.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.591
Now, we started hiring.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.811
And we needed to hire people
to do Terminator 2.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.465
On The Abyss,

19:22.509 --> 19:24.250
there were probably
seven or eight, um,

19:24.293 --> 19:25.947
computer graphics artists.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.514
And by the time
we got to Terminator

19:27.557 --> 19:29.994
it had grown to around 15.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.084
We were kind of new
to this whole field.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.217
We were inventing
it as we went along.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.481
I went into ILM
my first day,

19:38.525 --> 19:41.441
and they crack open a binder
full of storyboards,

19:41.484 --> 19:43.182
and I'm turning
through the pages

19:43.225 --> 19:44.705
and looking at one thing
and saying,

19:44.748 --> 19:46.881
"Oh, well,
how are we gonna do that?"

19:47.360 --> 19:49.362
And they said,
"Oh, we don't know yet."

19:50.101 --> 19:52.016
I turn a few more pages
and look at something else

19:52.060 --> 19:53.583
and,
"Oh, how do we do that?"

19:54.323 --> 19:55.803
"We don't know."

19:55.846 --> 19:57.848
And I thought,
"You people are crazy."

19:58.849 --> 20:01.069
What I knew
was geometry and animation,

20:01.112 --> 20:02.679
and a little bit
about lighting.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.290
I didn't know anything
about compositing,

20:04.333 --> 20:05.726
I certainly
didn't know anything

20:05.769 --> 20:07.336
about traditional
special effects.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.685
I wasn't even
a big movie buff, really.

20:09.469 --> 20:12.689
I had no training
in film whatsoever.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.822
Not a single day
of film school.

20:15.518 --> 20:18.478
Every filmmaker who wanted
to do something new,

20:18.521 --> 20:19.696
came to ILM.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.264
But, doing traditional effects,

20:22.308 --> 20:24.353
blowing things up
in camera,

20:24.397 --> 20:26.225
and then optically
printing them

20:26.268 --> 20:28.488
was very much
still the norm back then.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.707
As the manager of the company,

20:30.751 --> 20:32.927
what I really needed to do
is foster change,

20:32.970 --> 20:35.669
so I needed to take some of
the computer graphics people

20:35.712 --> 20:38.585
and put them in
with the old school masters.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.501
And I carved out,
like, a week of time

20:41.544 --> 20:43.894
of these people
to be together in a seminar

20:43.938 --> 20:45.505
so that
they could teach each other.

20:49.683 --> 20:53.208
It was like oil and water.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.732
And this is, uh,
C-3PO, huh, you know.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.169
The computer graphics people

20:58.213 --> 21:00.955
that were being hired
had very little time,

21:00.998 --> 21:03.827
nor interest,
in old school technology.

21:03.871 --> 21:06.047
And let's see how
his vital signs are.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.005
Well, after all these years
he still holds up.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.398
It was like, you know,

21:09.442 --> 21:11.313
your high school students
saying,

21:11.357 --> 21:12.880
"Why do I have to study math?
I don't need to study.

21:12.923 --> 21:14.534
I have this thing,
it's a calculator."

21:15.622 --> 21:18.755
We all loved ILM
and we loved George Lucas

21:18.799 --> 21:20.279
and we loved all that stuff

21:20.322 --> 21:21.671
'cause it had an impact
on our lives.

21:21.715 --> 21:24.892
But, we weren't,
like, mad fanboys.

21:24.935 --> 21:27.547
We believed in kind of
the irony of it all, you know?

21:27.590 --> 21:29.810
So, it wasn't, like,
to be taken so seriously,

21:29.853 --> 21:32.247
it wasn't, like, uh, uh,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.293
we wanted to deify
or worship all these things.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.164
So, we were-- First of all,
we were casual about it.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.298
Hello, how are you?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.387
My name's Dobbie,
Dobbie Dickwit.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.345
Steve Williams
was a combination

21:43.389 --> 21:47.915
of brilliance, naivete,
some childishness,

21:47.958 --> 21:50.744
all wrapped
into one package.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.485
And I think, uh,

21:52.528 --> 21:55.966
some of that rubbed management
the wrong way.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.751
He drove me crazy.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.492
He drove everybody crazy
in that marketing department

21:59.535 --> 22:01.407
'cause he did not do
what we wanted him to do.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.279
And he almost had,
like, a secret glee,

22:04.323 --> 22:06.063
by not doing
what we wanted him to do.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.763
If you're gonna have
a successful company

22:09.806 --> 22:11.504
with creative people in it,

22:11.547 --> 22:15.769
you gotta give some leeway
to these unusual types.

22:15.812 --> 22:19.642
They are young,
full of energy,

22:19.686 --> 22:22.950
and some of them
are oddballs.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.082
Well, hi there,
I am Hickory, I own this farm.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.693
-Nice to meet you.
-Ow!

22:26.736 --> 22:29.260
Let go
you fucking asshole.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.612
There was a lot
of serious work there,

22:32.655 --> 22:34.701
but there was also
a lot of nonsense.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.920
And you have to have
a lot of nonsense

22:36.964 --> 22:40.097
to actually get
creative stuff done.

22:40.141 --> 22:43.100
It's part of the equation.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.973
We would have these parties

22:46.016 --> 22:47.714
called "pit parties."

22:47.757 --> 22:49.498
We hung up fliers
all around the company,

22:49.542 --> 22:52.414
it said, "Nailed, an evening
of social penetration."

23:00.727 --> 23:02.946
We had two big bowls,

23:02.990 --> 23:04.818
"Mystic Masonic Punch,"

23:04.861 --> 23:06.863
and "Our Lady
of the Berry Wine."

23:07.908 --> 23:10.301
There are people running around
drunk out of their heads.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.479
There's really no guidelines

23:13.522 --> 23:15.263
or no established standards

23:15.306 --> 23:17.091
of how we were supposed
to behave

23:17.134 --> 23:19.354
or what we're supposed to do
or not do.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.530
So, there were certain drugs
were consumed,

23:21.574 --> 23:23.402
and, well,
I took some mushrooms

23:23.445 --> 23:25.447
and watched some black
and white movie in reverse.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.884
The fact
that they were down there

23:27.928 --> 23:29.582
in the pit, they could let off
a lot of steam.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.933
Steve would have a hockey stick
and he'd be bashing something.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.370
I end up falling off the desk

23:35.414 --> 23:36.850
and falling
into a pile of glass.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.069
I didn't have any feeling
for a while.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.724
I was suspended twice,

23:41.768 --> 23:43.465
because we fucking
destroyed the place.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.513
You needed to allow people

23:47.556 --> 23:50.951
to make mistakes
and experiment.

23:51.821 --> 23:54.563
You also needed to allow them
to understand

23:54.607 --> 23:55.956
that it was a business.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.872
There was a lot
of politics at the time

23:58.915 --> 24:00.874
because it was
a high-profile film.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.484
In The Abyss,

24:02.528 --> 24:04.225
you know,
there was a small sequence.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.835
James Cameron
had basically said,

24:05.879 --> 24:08.403
"If this does not get done
on schedule,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.318
I can just cut it out."

24:10.361 --> 24:12.973
Now, for Terminator 2,
it was pretty clear

24:13.016 --> 24:16.063
that if computer graphics
didn't work out,

24:16.106 --> 24:17.194
that would be a problem.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.806
So, the pressure was on.

24:19.849 --> 24:22.373
Somehow, everybody around us
just had to trust us.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.506
If the studio
was about to spend

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
five or six million dollars,

24:26.552 --> 24:29.076
they want somebody
that's got some cred, right?

24:29.119 --> 24:30.686
Not us young punks.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.862
For a group
of computer graphics people

24:32.906 --> 24:34.647
who are trying
to prove themselves,

24:34.690 --> 24:37.258
you had to have a face for that,
and that was Dennis.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.567
Dennis Muren
looms big over everything.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.612
He is Optimus Prime.

24:44.395 --> 24:45.832
Dennis had all the experience

24:45.875 --> 24:47.834
and such great credentials.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.531
He was the leader
of the pack.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.533
He was the guy
with the most gold statues,

24:51.577 --> 24:53.317
he was the guy that was still
standing in there the longest.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.276
He was the guy.

24:55.319 --> 24:57.452
Computer generated images
are a way of coming up

24:57.496 --> 24:58.888
with new effects.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.673
You're starting to see,
I think,

25:00.716 --> 25:03.197
a lot of the limits
of traditional effects.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.546
So, I've all the time,

25:04.590 --> 25:05.895
been sort of pushing
for this stuff to work.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.507
Dennis not only supported

25:08.550 --> 25:11.553
digital technology,
but embraced it and pressed it.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.556
He always,
I think, is looking big picture

25:14.600 --> 25:16.645
and understands
how all the elements fit.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.430
He could look at an image,
"It's not working."

25:19.474 --> 25:20.780
He's the kind of guy
that could say

25:20.823 --> 25:22.303
what'll make it work.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.783
And that's a big, big talent.

25:24.958 --> 25:26.437
He's one of the best.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.091
That's why
he's so well respected

25:28.135 --> 25:29.223
and won so many awards.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.314
He had the vision
to see where it could go,

25:33.357 --> 25:37.057
but the specifics
of making it go there,

25:37.100 --> 25:38.928
as far as the actual doing,

25:38.972 --> 25:40.713
fell, somewhat,
to other people.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.454
You know, hierarchies
being what they are,

25:43.498 --> 25:47.328
at some point you find yourself
now reporting to someone

25:47.371 --> 25:48.808
who knows less than you do

25:48.851 --> 25:51.027
about what it is
that you're doing.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.596
Dennis comes
from a camera background.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.467
He knows that area really well,

25:56.511 --> 25:59.514
but he was relying,
certainly, on us computer geeks

25:59.558 --> 26:01.516
to try
and bolt everything together

26:01.560 --> 26:02.735
and get the shots through.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.739
There's no one person
who can know or do everything

26:06.782 --> 26:10.569
and, so, you have to rely
on people who have expertise.

26:10.612 --> 26:14.007
If you're smart,
you get into that organization,

26:14.050 --> 26:17.097
you play by the rules,
you make connections,

26:17.140 --> 26:19.882
but you have to have
a bit of humility.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.930
The Spaz-Dippé
personality style

26:23.973 --> 26:25.279
I don't think fit.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.325
They had
more of a punk sensibility.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.371
The way they liked to dress

26:30.414 --> 26:32.242
and the way
they liked to do things

26:32.286 --> 26:35.028
was not the norm at ILM.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.421
There were several times
when they almost got fired

26:37.465 --> 26:39.859
During the making
of Terminator 2

26:39.902 --> 26:41.991
there was a dinner.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.080
And it's at Skywalker Ranch.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.952
The ranch was sort of verboten.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.346
We were sort of,
like, the bastard step-children

26:49.390 --> 26:51.610
that lived on Kerner
and ate at Foodles.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.178
Mark and I
are invited to the ranch.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.617
We ride our motorcycles
up Skywalker Ranch.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.402
We park them on the front,
like, 25 motorcycles.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.579
This office building
is a house.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.886
We went
into the executive dining room.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.149
The food's being served.
These two guys get bored

27:09.192 --> 27:11.107
and they decide
to get up and take a walk.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.848
We're just walkin'
around the house.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.329
And then at the very end,
there's a little, like,

27:15.372 --> 27:17.113
sunken den.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.942
They found their way
to George's private sanctum,

27:19.986 --> 27:22.510
the anteroom
to his actual office.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.555
And they walk into the office
and they sit down--

27:24.599 --> 27:27.950
Smoking cigars,
into George's liquor cabinet,

27:27.994 --> 27:29.822
feet up on the desk.

27:29.865 --> 27:33.173
Now, unbeknownst to us,
everything is alarmed.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.001
They have pressure sensitive
carpets up there.

27:35.044 --> 27:36.698
And all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

27:36.742 --> 27:39.222
the Skywalker police show up.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.747
Skywalker had their own police
and fire department.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.574
"What's going on here?
Who are you?"

27:43.618 --> 27:45.576
"What are you doing?
You're in George Lucas' office."

27:45.620 --> 27:47.448
They had done the unthinkable!

27:47.491 --> 27:51.408
They had actually gone in
and defouled the chambers!

27:51.452 --> 27:53.541
Spaz says,
"Well, my name is Scott Ross."

27:54.194 --> 27:56.718
Dippé gave his name
as Lincoln Hu,

27:56.762 --> 27:58.807
which caused
a certain amount of chagrin

27:58.851 --> 28:00.591
for the real Lincoln Hu.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.376
Lincoln Hu's one of
the only other Asian guys

28:02.419 --> 28:03.769
I can think of, even though
I'm only half Asian.

28:03.812 --> 28:05.553
And the security guy said,

28:05.596 --> 28:07.555
"We know who Scott Ross is.
What's your name?"

28:07.598 --> 28:10.950
And Spaz says, "You got me,
my name's Ed Jones."

28:11.515 --> 28:13.517
So, the next morning
the call comes in.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.258
"What the hell
did you guys do?"

28:15.302 --> 28:16.869
"We didn't do anything,
we were screwing around!"

28:16.912 --> 28:18.174
"Well, they think
you did something

28:18.218 --> 28:19.785
and you're in deep shit."

28:19.828 --> 28:21.612
I go, "Like what?"
"They want you fired."

28:21.656 --> 28:22.701
"What?"

28:23.223 --> 28:24.920
Doug Norby.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.879
Doug Norby was the head
of Lucas Film at the time.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.358
My arch nemesis.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.143
He calls me on the phone
and he says,

28:30.186 --> 28:33.146
"George is beside himself
and I want you to fire

28:33.189 --> 28:35.148
Lincoln Hu and Ed Jones."

28:35.191 --> 28:36.932
I said, "Well, first of all,
it wasn't Lincoln Hu

28:36.976 --> 28:38.629
and it wasn't Ed Jones,

28:38.673 --> 28:41.023
it was Steve Williams
and it was Mark Dippé."

28:41.067 --> 28:43.112
He says,
"George wants them fired."

28:44.200 --> 28:45.419
I said,
"I can't fire them."

28:46.115 --> 28:47.551
"Listen,
this is what George wants,

28:47.595 --> 28:49.553
-he wants them fired."
-Okay.

28:49.597 --> 28:50.903
Let me just put you
in the picture.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.470
If I fire these two guys,

28:53.514 --> 28:55.168
Jim Cameron

28:55.211 --> 28:58.693
and the entire
Columbia Legal Department

28:58.737 --> 29:01.043
is gonna be in your office
tomorrow

29:01.087 --> 29:04.568
because these two guys
are what makes Terminator 2.

29:05.613 --> 29:08.834
And if I fire the two of them,
the film doesn't get done

29:08.877 --> 29:10.313
and you're gonna be sued.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.099
"Okay,
let me get back to you."

29:13.142 --> 29:15.231
-"Thanks, Doug." Click.
-Damn it! You know?

29:15.754 --> 29:18.321
So, what they had to do
is they had to figure out

29:18.365 --> 29:19.845
how to penalize us.

29:19.888 --> 29:20.802
So, what happened
was we had to sit

29:20.846 --> 29:21.934
on a tribunal.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.500
Me and Mark on one side

29:23.544 --> 29:25.764
and all the head brass
of Lucas Film.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.505
They're asking us
the weirdest fucking questions

29:28.549 --> 29:30.116
in the world,
they're going,

29:30.159 --> 29:31.900
"If you're having a party
at your house,

29:31.944 --> 29:34.598
and you see that people
have gone into your bedroom

29:34.642 --> 29:36.296
during the party,
would you be offended?"

29:36.339 --> 29:38.167
I said, "No!
Are you kidding me?"

29:38.211 --> 29:39.516
They're-- I said,
"At my parties,

29:39.560 --> 29:40.822
everyone's in the bedroom!"

29:41.344 --> 29:44.695
This-- We-- we-- we--
This is ridiculous.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.959
Mark and I go,
"Look, we'll quit right now."

29:47.002 --> 29:49.570
We said we'll quit.
"Oh, no, no, no."

29:49.613 --> 29:51.180
"They can stay,

29:51.224 --> 29:53.704
but they are banned
from the ranch.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.577
They are no longer allowed
on the ranch."

29:56.620 --> 29:59.841
From that moment on,
they were persona non grata

29:59.885 --> 30:01.625
at the ranch.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.976
Lincoln Hu
winds up getting a phone call

30:04.019 --> 30:05.847
and it's Doug Norby.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.676
"I know it wasn't you,
I know it was the other guys

30:08.719 --> 30:10.765
and I'm really sorry
that I used your name,

30:10.809 --> 30:14.290
but I really wanna thank you
for the plate of cookies

30:14.334 --> 30:15.683
that you sent me."

30:15.726 --> 30:17.859
And Lincoln says, "Doug,

30:17.903 --> 30:21.167
I wouldn't eat any of those
cookies if I was you."

30:25.171 --> 30:27.129
I'm Roger Ebert
of theChicago Sun Times.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.914
And I'm Gene Siskel
of theChicago Tribune

30:28.957 --> 30:30.829
and our first film
isTerminator 2.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.136
Thanks to some
truly spectacular

30:34.180 --> 30:35.790
and mystifying
special effects,

30:35.834 --> 30:37.357
this is one terrific
action picture.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.837
I enjoyed it a lot more
than the original.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.013
It hit the press big.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.015
Tons of publicity and stuff.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.104
Accolades.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.889
No one had ever seen
anything like it before.

30:48.977 --> 30:51.284
Mark Dippé and I,
we were like these superstars.

30:52.241 --> 30:54.200
The press was crazy.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.985
Dennis and I did
a Timemagazine article
together

30:57.029 --> 30:58.639
and the way it was shown
was like,

30:58.682 --> 31:01.033
uh, the sorcerer
and his young apprentice.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.340
I think Dennis was a supporter
of the idea, but...

31:05.385 --> 31:08.562
you know, he's like--
A-- He was worried.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.042
I didn't go into this show

31:10.085 --> 31:11.870
relying on CG
to be able to do it.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.610
I had a backup plan.

31:13.654 --> 31:16.352
I was ready at any time
to start pulling out the--

31:16.396 --> 31:19.965
To get the model shop going
and getting the foam beam,

31:20.008 --> 31:21.444
you know,
whipped up, and castings

31:21.488 --> 31:23.142
and everything like that
if we had to

31:23.185 --> 31:25.144
and try, you know,
other techniques to do it.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.364
Those guys were working
with limitations.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.714
Technical limitations.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.369
When computer graphics
came along,

31:34.066 --> 31:35.545
we're really trying
to do better

31:35.589 --> 31:36.895
what the guy did before.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.421
Steve really pushed
on everyone.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.466
He knew what we could do

31:43.510 --> 31:44.728
and that we could
push it further.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.209
Maybe that's where
some of the friction came from.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.385
It will be no secret

31:49.429 --> 31:52.867
that Dennis
and Spaz's relationship...

31:56.305 --> 32:00.353
was not always
the friendliest thing.

32:00.396 --> 32:01.963
Oddly enough,
the biggest obstacles

32:02.007 --> 32:04.226
I ran into
were the experts at ILM.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.360
They were the obstacles.
It wasn't the technology.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.752
They were the obstacles.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.494
He was like having
the crazy grandfather

32:11.538 --> 32:13.105
in the room
that was in World War II

32:13.148 --> 32:15.324
and is mumbling stories
about World War II,

32:15.368 --> 32:17.109
but you're supposed
to listen to him

32:17.152 --> 32:18.675
because if you don't, you know,

32:18.719 --> 32:21.504
it's considered
politically incorrect.

32:21.548 --> 32:23.550
The big shift
in your time, I guess,

32:23.593 --> 32:24.986
was from optical to digital

32:25.030 --> 32:26.640
and, so,
you went through, what,

32:26.683 --> 32:28.947
a kind of crisis
or a period of learning?

32:28.990 --> 32:30.861
The credit was given
to the person

32:30.905 --> 32:32.994
that actually didn't even
understand how it was done.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.822
The Abyss just looked amazing

32:34.865 --> 32:36.998
and I thought,
"This is gonna work."

32:37.042 --> 32:39.000
And I don't understand it.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.437
This was such a new technology,
he wouldn't have had any clue.

32:47.356 --> 32:51.056
I got that big van Dam
folly book on CG,

32:51.099 --> 32:54.494
I read that just from front
to back over a period of weeks.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.282
After The Abyss,

33:00.935 --> 33:02.719
he got an Oscar for it.

33:02.763 --> 33:04.547
And I'm here
for Industrial Light and Magic

33:04.591 --> 33:06.201
and thanks everybody
who worked on the show

33:06.245 --> 33:08.160
from up there,
John Knoll and, uh,

33:08.203 --> 33:10.249
everyone in the computer
graphics department.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.294
And thanks so much,
especially to Jim Cameron,

33:12.338 --> 33:13.817
my wife, Zara, and Gregory.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.080
Thank you!

33:23.566 --> 33:26.700
No, I missed that,
uh, where-- What's this?

33:26.743 --> 33:28.745
For The Abyss?
What-- It looks a little soft.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.793
I think in any environment
like that,

33:32.836 --> 33:36.536
you're gonna have some,
uh, jealousy.

33:37.319 --> 33:40.583
Everybody is jockeying
for a position.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.195
But I don't think,
uh, Steve Williams

33:43.238 --> 33:44.805
was jockeying for anything.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.547
He was not a ladder climber.

33:48.635 --> 33:51.029
He just wanted to have fun
and do his art.

33:52.030 --> 33:55.033
He was the one
actually hands-on creating.

33:56.338 --> 33:59.037
He would work late nights
in the pit.

33:59.515 --> 34:00.995
That's when he would focus
the most

34:01.039 --> 34:02.910
and follow his own instincts.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.957
Politically,
you don't see this stuff coming

34:07.001 --> 34:08.698
because you're so engrossed
in what you're doing.

34:10.526 --> 34:12.180
There's always been bureaucracy

34:12.224 --> 34:14.095
and red tape and politics

34:14.139 --> 34:17.098
and there were politics at ILM
back in the day, too.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.796
You know,
there was a big man on campus,

34:19.840 --> 34:20.884
bigger than Steve.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.932
Won numerous Oscars.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.239
I'd like to thank my mom
and John Berg and Phil Tippett

34:27.282 --> 34:29.067
and Ken
and all the camera department.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.112
And thank you very much
to Mike McAllister, uh,

34:31.156 --> 34:33.332
Mike Pangrazio,
and the math department.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.160
I'd very much like to thank
Bruce Nicholson,

34:35.203 --> 34:37.466
Mike McAllister,
Mike Owens.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.164
Well,
thank you to the Academy,

34:39.207 --> 34:41.122
and Steven Spielberg,
George Lucas,

34:41.166 --> 34:43.124
Kathy Kennedy, Frank Marshall,
and Robert Watts.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.865
This is a big thrill.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.649
We'd really like to thank
the Academy,

34:46.693 --> 34:48.477
Joe Dante for doing
his great direction,

34:48.521 --> 34:50.000
Mike Finnell,
of course, Steven Spielberg-

34:50.044 --> 34:51.959
His name was gonna be
at the top,

34:52.002 --> 34:53.439
regardless of all the people
who were working underneath

34:53.482 --> 34:54.614
and there were dozens
and dozens,

34:54.657 --> 34:56.311
Steve was just one of 'em.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.661
Secondly, there's the concept
of, you know,

34:58.705 --> 35:00.663
there's your story,
there's my story,

35:00.707 --> 35:02.100
and there's the story.

35:02.665 --> 35:03.753
I think, you know...

35:05.146 --> 35:08.062
history is written
for the victors.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.632
The Oscar goes to
Dennis Muren,

35:12.675 --> 35:14.851
Stan Winston,
Gene Warren, Jr.,

35:14.895 --> 35:16.375
and Robert Skotak.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.246
Terminator 2:
Judgement Day.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.470
Thanks to, uh, everyone
at Industrial Light and Magic,

35:24.513 --> 35:27.037
and especially my incredible
computer graphic team.

35:27.081 --> 35:30.737
To Janet Healy, Mark Dippé,
my wife, Zara, Gregory,

35:30.780 --> 35:33.914
and Gwendolyn,
and especially Jim Cameron.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.143
He didn't mention me.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.234
I remember I was so mad,
I put my fist through a wall.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.298
I never thought about,
politically,

36:10.342 --> 36:11.734
how to play
this fuckin' chess game.

36:14.259 --> 36:16.348
We were thinking about
creating the art, right?

36:16.391 --> 36:17.566
Creating these ideas.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.526
We weren't thinking about,

36:20.569 --> 36:21.701
"What does
this mean for my future?"

36:21.744 --> 36:25.792
♪

36:33.626 --> 36:35.105
There's always
gonna be a bigger fish

36:35.149 --> 36:36.194
who's gonna get
the credit.

36:38.457 --> 36:39.936
That's how the game is played.

36:41.851 --> 36:42.939
That's life.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.726
If you wanna stay
in the industry,

36:46.769 --> 36:47.857
you gotta play the game.

36:51.034 --> 36:52.297
Steve didn't play that game.

36:53.733 --> 36:55.996
He didn't know how to.
He didn't want to.

36:59.695 --> 37:00.914
That's why he stood out.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.658
You learn a lot
in an environment like that.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.964
Not just about how to do,

37:08.008 --> 37:11.707
what is, ostensibly, your job,
but how it fits with the rest.

37:14.449 --> 37:17.322
Not everybody really fits
that environment

37:17.844 --> 37:20.586
and you function
within this hierarchy.

37:21.978 --> 37:24.590
This is the sort of
through to the bone moment

37:24.633 --> 37:27.549
where you realize,
"Yes, the game is changing."

37:34.295 --> 37:37.690
In June of '91,
this meeting happened

37:37.733 --> 37:40.345
at a place called
Yu Shang across from ILM.

37:40.997 --> 37:42.695
So, Mark Dippé
and I are sitting there

37:42.738 --> 37:45.219
and Dennis Muren's there,
John Schlag's there,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.570
Mike Natkin is there,
Stefen Fangmeier's there.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.008
Muren said Steven Spielberg
is coming up with this new film

37:52.052 --> 37:53.532
based on
Michael Crighton's book

37:53.575 --> 37:54.881
called Jurassic Park.

37:55.621 --> 37:58.754
It's about a bunch of dinosaurs
in a park and it goes awry.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.930
When Jurassicstarted,

38:00.974 --> 38:03.455
there were three
different approaches

38:03.498 --> 38:05.979
in companies
that were going to handle it.

38:06.022 --> 38:09.678
Stan Winston's group would do
the physical creatures,

38:09.722 --> 38:10.897
the close ups.

38:11.506 --> 38:14.335
Phil Tippet's group
would do the medium shots

38:14.379 --> 38:16.642
via stop-motion
where you could see

38:16.685 --> 38:18.470
all the action
of a dinosaur.

38:19.514 --> 38:23.213
And then ILM would do
the far away heard shots.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.259
The long shots.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.826
Oh, they're way over there

38:26.869 --> 38:28.567
and they're only this big
in the frame

38:28.610 --> 38:30.699
and we can get away
with all kinds of cheats.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.354
These are the decisions we made.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.617
Here's where we're going.
This is great.

38:38.490 --> 38:43.669
So, Steve Williams,
Mark Dippé said,

38:43.712 --> 38:45.061
"Why don't we just build
the whole thing

38:45.105 --> 38:46.193
on computer graphics?

38:46.672 --> 38:48.151
Let's just do
the whole thing."

38:52.895 --> 38:54.941
Yeah, that's a tough one, um--

38:54.984 --> 38:56.682
Sure. Yeah, um--

38:56.725 --> 38:59.162
We're all like, uh, okay?

38:59.206 --> 39:00.816
We're ready for this,
we can do this.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.601
-We gotta fuckin' do it.
-Oh, no.

39:02.644 --> 39:04.777
No, no, no, no, no.
Nope. Nope.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.867
Muren, he's just blank.
Like, Orphan Annie eyes.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.870
Fangmeier, he jumped in
right away and said no.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.829
We're in the last stretches
of completing Terminator 2.

39:13.873 --> 39:17.267
We're working 16-hour days,
we're all worn out.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.313
So, I think
we were rather cautious.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.751
The amount of work is so large
and unknowns, so many.

39:22.795 --> 39:25.406
People were being negative.

39:25.450 --> 39:27.974
Now, look,
you've done chrome,

39:28.017 --> 39:29.758
you've done water,

39:29.802 --> 39:31.412
but you've never done anything
living, breathing.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.197
The liquid metal,
poly alloy Terminator

39:34.241 --> 39:36.635
was simpler than a dinosaur.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.506
We knew
we'd never done it before.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.986
Even The Abyss,
I'd never done that before,

39:40.029 --> 39:41.727
but I said I could do it.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.032
T2, same thing,
I'd never done it before,

39:43.076 --> 39:44.556
but I said I could do it.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.340
Steve Williams
and Mark Dippé

39:46.384 --> 39:48.386
knew that the time
was right.

39:48.429 --> 39:49.648
They could just see it.

39:50.170 --> 39:53.129
The opportunity was there,
they wanted to seize it.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.437
And I think other people
was like "Whoa, that's--

39:56.481 --> 39:58.831
No, we're not going
into this whole new realm."

40:00.659 --> 40:04.140
The powers that be
were just so concerned.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.969
Phil was definitely a nay-sayer
in the beginning.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.320
I kinda felt it was, like...

40:11.409 --> 40:12.453
the Wild West.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.413
These new guys were coming in.

40:16.109 --> 40:18.677
The young gunslingers,
you know,

40:18.720 --> 40:22.028
it was like, you know,
I can outdraw you.

40:23.159 --> 40:26.554
Phil Tippett,
the enfant terrible

40:26.598 --> 40:28.643
of stop motion visual effects.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.080
He'’s the real deal.

40:31.646 --> 40:34.170
Watching Phil Tippett work,

40:34.214 --> 40:36.216
it was real apparent
real quick

40:36.259 --> 40:37.913
that he was
one of those magic people.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.961
When you have
that much talent

40:42.004 --> 40:44.006
and you have
that much knowledge

40:44.050 --> 40:46.313
and you have
that much work discipline,

40:46.356 --> 40:49.795
it makes you
a sort of super,

40:49.838 --> 40:51.144
uber effects geek.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.189
And that was Phil.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.889
Phil Tippett
and Dennis Muren both worked

40:56.932 --> 41:00.936
at Cascade at the early parts
of their careers.

41:00.980 --> 41:04.462
They worked on Dragon Slayer
together in 1981.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.595
They'’d had a long relationship.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.338
Right from the start,
Dennis was in the position

41:11.381 --> 41:13.296
of having people that he knew

41:13.340 --> 41:15.603
that he wanted to make sure
they were a part of the mix.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.128
Steve knew what we could do,

41:19.172 --> 41:20.390
and that
we could push it further.

41:21.566 --> 41:24.569
I perceived
just a slight amount of,

41:24.612 --> 41:27.223
you know,
competition on their side,

41:27.267 --> 41:29.574
you know,
needing to prove themselves.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.271
That'’s why Phil got mad.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.186
Because we were trying
to do a stop-motion film

41:33.229 --> 41:34.492
using computer graphics.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.842
He led the camp that

41:36.885 --> 41:38.626
that is the wrong road
to go down.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.586
I think from
Dennis'’ point of view,

41:41.629 --> 41:42.804
he was worried.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.590
He'’s, like,
"“Dude, this is a lot different

41:45.633 --> 41:47.026
than liquid metal."”

41:47.069 --> 41:49.115
And then Phil was like,

41:49.158 --> 41:51.770
"“Computer animation,
that'’s the wrong approach."”

41:52.858 --> 41:55.817
The stop-motion footage
was the selected solution.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.733
Full-scale
animatronics with Stan Winston.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.909
That was the approach
that was agreed upon

42:00.953 --> 42:02.520
and that was the road
they were going down.

42:03.129 --> 42:04.826
Everything had been assigned.

42:04.870 --> 42:06.524
Stan'’s doing this,
Phil'’s doing this,

42:06.567 --> 42:07.612
Stan'’s doing this
and that'’s it.

42:08.090 --> 42:09.570
This is the technology
we are using.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.354
There is no room
for a new technology.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.408
There was something
about being told no,

42:21.451 --> 42:25.281
um, you know,
if you'’re rebellious,

42:25.325 --> 42:28.981
you know, "no" is actually
really, um, a fuel for you.

42:30.069 --> 42:33.115
He took it
upon himself to just prove it

42:33.159 --> 42:36.292
and the only way
to prove that is to show it.

42:36.336 --> 42:39.121
Steve, Spaz,
starts by making a skeleton.

42:42.255 --> 42:44.518
I literally did
exactly what I did

42:44.562 --> 42:47.260
with the T-Rex
that I did with the T-1000.

42:48.348 --> 42:50.002
I just built the bones.

42:50.829 --> 42:54.136
I built the damn thing,
secretly, on my own time.

42:55.224 --> 42:57.009
It was a complete act
of rebellion.

42:58.793 --> 43:00.447
I think one of the reasons
they tried to stop

43:00.490 --> 43:02.231
that type of innovation
is because

43:02.275 --> 43:04.625
the visual effects gurus
who didn'’t theorize it,

43:04.669 --> 43:07.323
would be seen
as having egg on their face.

43:08.498 --> 43:09.935
I just believed we could do it.

43:11.414 --> 43:12.851
But actually having to prove it,

43:13.634 --> 43:14.853
that was the challenge.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.724
Because it was all about proof.

43:18.117 --> 43:19.771
I remember
Dennis Muren, actually,

43:19.814 --> 43:22.121
he had heard a rumor
from one of his little

43:22.164 --> 43:23.862
weaselly minions
that I was building

43:23.905 --> 43:25.080
a set of T-Rex bones.

43:25.907 --> 43:27.605
He told me, to my face,

43:29.171 --> 43:31.434
"Don'’t bother trying to build
the T-Rex."

43:32.305 --> 43:33.523
Phil'’s doing it.

43:34.873 --> 43:36.265
I was saying,
"Guys, don'’t do this,

43:36.309 --> 43:38.050
"you know,
Phil-- Phil'’s my buddy,

43:38.093 --> 43:39.878
he'’s got the job
for everything else, you know?

43:39.921 --> 43:41.749
And just let this play out."

43:41.793 --> 43:43.577
That'’s what he said.
That'’s what he said.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.970
And he hadn'’t seen
anything yet.

43:47.712 --> 43:51.629
I don'’t worry
about hardly anything, ever.

43:54.762 --> 43:56.068
Although...

43:57.156 --> 43:58.984
you know, I'’ve got this anxiety

43:59.027 --> 44:01.203
that'’s like
the sword of Damocles

44:01.247 --> 44:02.770
that'’s hanging over my head.

44:04.729 --> 44:06.426
Sometimes, I just feel like

44:07.209 --> 44:08.515
something terrible''’s
gonna happen.

44:11.300 --> 44:13.607
Steve Williams, uh,

44:13.651 --> 44:17.219
on his own, put together
a Tyrannosaurus skeleton

44:17.263 --> 44:19.352
and did a walk cycle.

44:20.614 --> 44:25.880
♪

44:30.580 --> 44:33.801
I don'’t think
we fully realized...

44:35.368 --> 44:36.543
how...

44:38.980 --> 44:41.026
that was going
to change everything.

44:41.679 --> 44:43.332
It was all secret,
no one knew about it.

44:44.943 --> 44:46.901
There was a big meeting
that was going to happen.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.425
Kathleen Kennedy,

44:49.469 --> 44:52.385
Frank Marshall, Dennis Muren,
and Janet Healy.

44:53.255 --> 44:55.301
Janet Healy is the producer,

44:55.344 --> 44:58.260
Dennis Muren is the visual
effects supervisor.

44:58.304 --> 45:01.133
I looked at it as, like,
"Oh, this is mom and dad."

45:01.176 --> 45:02.438
They'’re in charge.

45:03.831 --> 45:06.312
I didn''’t know when the
entourage
was gonna come up,

45:06.355 --> 45:07.879
but I knew
they were coming up eventually,

45:07.922 --> 45:09.924
so I got wind of it.

45:09.968 --> 45:12.579
Frank and Kathy had come in
because Steven couldn'’t come in.

45:14.015 --> 45:17.062
Kathleen Kennedy was
Steven Spielberg'’s producer.

45:17.105 --> 45:19.238
Kathleen Kennedy,
Frank Marshall,

45:19.281 --> 45:21.762
they were gonna come walking in
on a Monday morning

45:21.806 --> 45:23.808
in November in 1991.

45:23.851 --> 45:25.505
And I guess
the hard part of that

45:25.548 --> 45:27.159
was he had to find
a way to get that

45:27.202 --> 45:29.465
in front of Kathleen Kennedy.

45:30.423 --> 45:31.772
And he found a way to do that.

45:32.860 --> 45:34.819
This was not supposed to happen.

45:36.255 --> 45:38.474
Dennis and Janet, they didn'’t
know it was gonna happen.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.956
I had a playing on a monitor,

45:42.827 --> 45:44.654
and everyone came walking in.

45:45.830 --> 45:47.919
She immediately
sees it right away.

45:49.050 --> 45:50.269
and she goes, "“What'’s this?"”

45:51.879 --> 45:53.228
I said,
"“Well, I was just working on

45:53.272 --> 45:55.448
this walking T-Rex bone thing."”

45:59.234 --> 46:01.149
Kathleen Kennedy pats me
on the back and goes,

46:01.193 --> 46:03.238
"“You have a very bright future."”
And that was that.

46:04.022 --> 46:05.980
That'’s the first
and only time I ever met her.

46:06.415 --> 46:08.069
I never-- never saw her again.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.985
That'’s where everything changed.

46:11.029 --> 46:13.814
Dennis Muren said, "Okay,
this is really interesting.

46:13.858 --> 46:15.642
I didn'’t know
how close we could get.

46:15.685 --> 46:17.905
And then eventually
some of the guys did some tests

46:17.949 --> 46:19.994
on a T-Rex
which came out really great

46:20.038 --> 46:23.258
and surprised everybody
and then we skinned that.

46:23.302 --> 46:25.434
All we had at this time was
a skeleton and we were going,

46:25.478 --> 46:27.219
-"We can do it!"
-Stan Winston is gonna set up

46:27.262 --> 46:29.525
a five-foot model.
Mark and I cut it up into bits

46:30.135 --> 46:33.747
and we put it in a cyborg
scanner and scan all the pieces.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.575
I have to reconstruct

46:35.618 --> 46:37.838
all the data to have
the proper contour muscles.

46:38.491 --> 46:41.146
I built the skin version
of the T-Rex.

46:41.624 --> 46:42.974
It was all working.

46:43.409 --> 46:45.715
ILM, you know,
largely through Steve Williams,

46:45.759 --> 46:48.196
Mark Dippé, and, uh,
Stefen Fangmeier

46:48.240 --> 46:50.459
put together
the first dinosaur tests.

46:50.503 --> 46:52.287
The film couldn'’t
have happened without them.

46:52.331 --> 46:53.811
It certainly
couldn'’t have happened

46:53.854 --> 46:55.725
without Steve'’s
ability to model,

46:55.769 --> 46:57.162
uh, first the Terminator
and then later the dinosaurs.

46:57.205 --> 46:58.641
The film, at the same time,

46:58.685 --> 47:00.339
also was very much
still on track

47:00.382 --> 47:02.167
to do, uh, stop-motion.

47:02.907 --> 47:05.083
Back then,
everything that we did

47:05.126 --> 47:06.519
hadn'’t been done before.

47:06.562 --> 47:07.694
I mean, certainly,
nobody attempted

47:07.737 --> 47:09.522
to do dinosaurs before.

47:09.565 --> 47:14.179
They made a convincing
computer graphic Tyrannosaurus.

47:15.267 --> 47:17.356
The first fully skinned version.

47:17.878 --> 47:19.749
And we had it walkin'’.
In daylight.

47:20.489 --> 47:23.449
Then Dennis and Janet
with Tippett went down

47:23.492 --> 47:25.843
to Universal to show it
to Steven Spielberg,

47:26.626 --> 47:27.888
but I wasn'’t
allowed to be there.

47:28.802 --> 47:30.586
I got a call from Dennis Muren
at ILM,

47:30.630 --> 47:32.284
who already had the job

47:32.327 --> 47:33.807
of doing Jurassic Park
with Phil Tippett.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.504
And Dennis said
that he thought

47:35.548 --> 47:38.551
that he could
pull off a full-sized dinosaur

47:38.594 --> 47:40.858
that would be authentic
to the eye.

47:40.901 --> 47:42.903
Spielberg suddenly went
absolutely insane

47:42.947 --> 47:45.297
and said everything was gonna
be computer graphics now.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.081
That'’s the future.

47:48.039 --> 47:50.737
That'’s the way
it'’s gonna be from now on.

48:14.804 --> 48:17.590
That first
shot of the Brachiosaurus...

48:19.244 --> 48:21.681
my jaw dropped,
I had literally--

48:27.774 --> 48:29.689
And then that wide reveal

48:29.732 --> 48:31.560
of them all out there
on the plain.

48:31.604 --> 48:33.649
♪

48:37.305 --> 48:39.481
That'’s still the one
that gets my heart.

48:43.746 --> 48:45.661
I swear to God,
it looked like

48:45.705 --> 48:47.620
National Geographic went back
in a time machine

48:47.663 --> 48:49.665
and shot real dinosaurs,
and that'’s what I fucking saw.

48:49.709 --> 48:53.582
Those things looked real
and what they were representing

48:53.626 --> 48:55.541
was not some sci-fi thing.

48:56.846 --> 48:58.892
As far as we know,
those things moved around

48:58.936 --> 49:00.459
like that and that'’s what
they looked like,

49:00.502 --> 49:02.809
that'’s what they did.

49:02.852 --> 49:05.203
Jurassic Park took
everybody by surprise.

49:05.246 --> 49:06.726
Nobody saw that one coming.

49:07.814 --> 49:10.773
For almost 75 years,
the technology

49:10.817 --> 49:14.168
and the techniques
were pretty much the same.

49:14.212 --> 49:17.258
Jurassic, that'’s when
the computers came in.

49:20.348 --> 49:22.481
That'’s when the tsunami hit.

49:24.048 --> 49:26.006
Jurassic Park opened tonight

49:26.050 --> 49:29.009
with predictions that it may be
the biggest hit in years and,

49:29.053 --> 49:30.663
like any great event,

49:30.706 --> 49:32.447
people are camped out
to be part of it.

49:32.491 --> 49:34.232
We got here
about 11 o'’clock this morning.

49:34.275 --> 49:35.755
11:00
this morning for what show?

49:35.798 --> 49:38.018
Uh, the 10:45 tomorrow morning.

49:38.062 --> 49:42.022
That was the turning
point of visual filmmaking.

49:42.066 --> 49:43.893
People, especially kids,

49:43.937 --> 49:46.026
- like dinosaurs.
-Jurassic Park!

49:46.070 --> 49:47.854
Where the giant dinosaurs
live again!

49:47.897 --> 49:49.464
With all the excitement

49:49.508 --> 49:51.162
-of the movie!
-Dino damage!

49:51.205 --> 49:52.685
Only at Jurassic Park!

49:53.947 --> 49:56.602
The film was supposed
to be a stop-motion film.

49:57.646 --> 49:59.344
Computer graphics came in

49:59.387 --> 50:01.476
and completely deposed
all of it.

50:02.956 --> 50:05.132
It destroyed one thing,
but it begat another.

50:06.481 --> 50:08.701
I had come up
with this test that--

50:08.744 --> 50:11.138
It seemed it revolutionized
everything.

50:11.182 --> 50:13.836
The call came down--
Dennis called me at home

50:13.880 --> 50:16.796
and said, "I'’m afraid
I have some bad news.

50:16.839 --> 50:20.017
Steven'’s decided
to do the whole show CG

50:20.060 --> 50:22.236
and I-- You know,
like the Bombay doors just,

50:25.544 --> 50:27.111
You know, I saw,
you know, like,

50:27.154 --> 50:29.026
the-- the end and I--
"Oh, shit,

50:29.069 --> 50:30.723
now what am I gonna do?

50:30.766 --> 50:32.594
I thought, because
I was animation supervisor

50:32.638 --> 50:36.337
on, um, Terminator 2,
which is very successful,

50:36.381 --> 50:37.904
you know, I was gonna be

50:37.947 --> 50:38.818
animation supervisor
on Jurassic.

50:40.472 --> 50:42.648
I literally ambushed them
with the image.

50:42.691 --> 50:44.563
I thought,
"How much more can I do

50:44.606 --> 50:46.608
to actually to prove
that I came up with the idea?"

50:47.522 --> 50:49.872
I thought for sure
it was a slam dunk.

50:51.309 --> 50:52.919
There was no definition

50:52.962 --> 50:54.964
about what the jobs were
on Jurassic Park.

50:55.791 --> 50:57.532
So, I asked Janet Healy,

50:57.576 --> 50:58.881
I said, "“Well, you know,
what'’s goin' on?

50:58.925 --> 51:00.666
What'’s my position?"”

51:00.709 --> 51:02.537
"“You'’re just an animator
on the film."”

51:02.581 --> 51:05.497
"“What? Who'’s
the animation supervisor?"”

51:08.891 --> 51:10.589
Dennis,
in all of his brilliance,

51:11.633 --> 51:13.679
he has a plan B.

51:23.210 --> 51:24.690
Phil Tippett wanted to actually

51:24.733 --> 51:26.822
do storyboards
three dimensionally

51:26.866 --> 51:30.174
with little figures
of dinosaurs and people

51:30.217 --> 51:33.002
that would completely imitate
my storyboards,

51:33.046 --> 51:36.310
but flesh out my storyboards
and give them dimension.

51:36.354 --> 51:38.138
Storyboards don'’t show you

51:38.182 --> 51:40.749
any of the-- the temporal
cadence, the sequence,

51:40.793 --> 51:44.318
the timing of it and, uh,
the animatics allowed us

51:44.362 --> 51:48.017
to-- to block out the entire,
you know, sequence.

51:49.715 --> 51:52.544
Phil was able
to turn himself

51:52.587 --> 51:54.502
into the director
of the CGI dinosaurs.

51:54.546 --> 51:57.940
He knew so much about dinosaurs
and the behavior of animals.

51:57.984 --> 51:59.899
I go into dailies
at 8:00 AM

51:59.942 --> 52:02.815
and there'’s Phil Tippett,
who'’s now functioning

52:02.858 --> 52:05.339
as the animation director
for Jurassic Park.

52:09.082 --> 52:12.781
Wow! And the Oscar goes to...

52:12.825 --> 52:15.436
Dennis Muren, Stan Winston,
Phil Tippett,

52:15.480 --> 52:18.222
and Michael Lantieri
for Jurassic Park !

52:18.265 --> 52:19.745
♪

52:33.367 --> 52:35.152
Thanks, ILM.
Thanks, Tippet Studios.

52:35.195 --> 52:37.328
Thanks, Steven Spielberg.
Thanks Mike--

52:54.345 --> 52:56.564
I'’ve always believed the people

52:56.608 --> 52:59.437
that worked on the work
should be acknowledged for it.

53:01.265 --> 53:04.746
Any time an individual
took an award

53:04.790 --> 53:07.793
and took the award home
and took the accolades for it,

53:07.836 --> 53:09.447
to me, it was theft.

53:11.405 --> 53:13.538
ILM had won
14 Oscars at that time.

53:15.757 --> 53:17.629
Not one of ''‘em were at ILM.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.675
Not one!

53:22.242 --> 53:24.201
So, these guys had
the audacity

53:24.244 --> 53:27.029
to actually take this piece
of shit home with them

53:27.073 --> 53:29.989
when it was representing
30 or 40 people.

53:31.817 --> 53:33.297
Regardless of what they do...

53:34.298 --> 53:36.735
this is what
their credit is on the film.

53:36.778 --> 53:38.215
And if it wins an Oscar

53:38.258 --> 53:39.520
for visual effects,
they get it.

53:42.088 --> 53:43.350
That'’s the way it works.

53:44.656 --> 53:46.223
If you point
to any one person

53:46.266 --> 53:48.050
it couldn'’t have
been done without 'em,

53:48.094 --> 53:49.878
it probably is Steve,
''‘cause I don'’t know

53:49.922 --> 53:51.706
that anybody else could'’ve
modeled those dinosaurs,

53:51.750 --> 53:53.230
I don'’t know
that anybody else could'’ve set

53:53.273 --> 53:54.535
the standards
for animating them.

53:54.579 --> 53:55.754
I don'’t know
that we would'’ve even tried.

53:59.845 --> 54:00.933
I'’m not a diplomat.

54:02.630 --> 54:03.718
I never have been.

54:05.416 --> 54:07.766
To a fault,
I'’ve been a very bad diplomat.

54:10.116 --> 54:12.292
I'’m not political,
I'’m not political,

54:12.336 --> 54:14.294
I've--
I'’ve never been political.

54:14.338 --> 54:16.122
Right? I'’m not good at it.

54:16.165 --> 54:17.471
You know, I-- Look at me,
for fuck'’s sakes,

54:17.515 --> 54:18.820
man, I look like
fuckin'’ Popeye.

54:18.864 --> 54:20.518
You know? Fuck.

54:20.561 --> 54:22.563
After Jurassic,
I did a bunch of interviews

54:22.607 --> 54:24.696
and stuff like that and I told
the truth about what happened.

54:24.739 --> 54:26.611
The entire film
ofJurassic was--

54:26.654 --> 54:27.786
This is Jurassic Park?

54:27.829 --> 54:28.961
Right.

54:37.491 --> 54:39.058
I was told not to do it

54:39.101 --> 54:40.842
by my supervisors and I did it,
you know?

54:40.886 --> 54:42.366
I built it.

54:42.931 --> 54:44.585
Dennis Muren
got mad at me a few times.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.372
He pulled me into
his office and he said,

54:48.415 --> 54:50.243
"I don'’t know
why you'’re saying all this."

54:50.287 --> 54:52.201
And then I said, "Well, Dennis,
this is what happened."

54:52.245 --> 54:55.030
And he goes, "You'’re committing
political suicide."

54:55.074 --> 54:56.684
That'’s what he told me.

54:56.728 --> 54:58.686
Steve Williams foresees the day

54:58.730 --> 55:01.341
when it will be commonplace
for computer generated actors

55:01.385 --> 55:04.257
to star alongside
real actors.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.215
I think that you'’ll have
characters acting

55:06.259 --> 55:09.436
with current famous people, um,
that are computer generated,

55:09.480 --> 55:11.264
but you'’ll also be able
to introduce characters

55:11.308 --> 55:14.006
that have been dead
for 50 or 60 years.

55:14.049 --> 55:15.877
In the future, I mean, it'’s
quite obvious what'’ll happen.

55:15.921 --> 55:18.489
It will actually scan the actor
in a polygonal data set

55:18.532 --> 55:19.794
of computer generated data--

55:19.838 --> 55:21.840
Are they worried
about this?

55:21.883 --> 55:23.624
-If I was an actor I'’d, uh--
-Actually, SAG,

55:23.668 --> 55:25.322
the Screen Actors Guild,
is very interested in it.

55:25.365 --> 55:27.193
Are actors right
to have concerns

55:27.236 --> 55:28.629
that they'’ll eventually
be phased out all together?

55:28.673 --> 55:30.805
This will be abused
and-- and--

55:30.849 --> 55:32.633
and the trick is
for all of us to stand up

55:32.677 --> 55:34.331
and say,
"No, that'’s wrong,

55:34.374 --> 55:35.767
This is a violation,

55:35.810 --> 55:37.595
this is not
what we should be doing.

55:37.638 --> 55:39.727
Synthetic actors are inevitable,
there'’s no doubt.

55:39.771 --> 55:41.425
We'’re talking about
the morals!

55:41.468 --> 55:42.948
This is unfortunately
what'’s happening.

55:42.991 --> 55:44.993
To be human is to bleed,

55:45.037 --> 55:46.995
is to have a soul,
is to breathe.

55:47.039 --> 55:48.954
See-- see, we'’re not trying
to duplicate human beings,

55:48.997 --> 55:51.173
but what you'’re seeing
is subjective already.

55:51.217 --> 55:52.914
How many times
have you met an actor

55:52.958 --> 55:54.916
who'’s either shorter
or smaller in person?

55:54.960 --> 55:56.875
So, what you'’re seeing
is already an "interpretation"

55:56.918 --> 55:59.094
-of what they look like.
-Absolutely.

55:59.138 --> 56:01.140
-This is what we'’re trying--
-We'’re down

56:01.183 --> 56:02.750
-to our last two minutes.
-Good afternoon,

56:02.794 --> 56:04.273
my name is Thomas White,
I handle Artists' Rights

56:04.317 --> 56:05.884
Enforcement Matters
for the estate

56:05.927 --> 56:07.320
of Fred Astaire,
the estate of Orson Welles,

56:07.364 --> 56:08.800
and the director,
Stanley Kramer.

56:08.843 --> 56:10.671
All uses from my clients
get licensed.

56:10.715 --> 56:12.412
If they don'’t get licensed,
they get prosecuted.

56:12.456 --> 56:13.979
-It'’s that simple.
-Good.

56:14.022 --> 56:16.416
And the damages--
the damages that we seek

56:16.460 --> 56:18.897
and the attorney's fees
are extraordinarily high.

56:18.940 --> 56:21.334
Thank you all very much
and I think we'’re done.

56:23.423 --> 56:25.469
They all denied
what we were doing.

56:26.121 --> 56:28.167
And, to me, that'’s a fight.

56:29.342 --> 56:31.039
You wanna fuckin'’
get in a fight, man?

56:31.083 --> 56:32.563
You wanna fuckin'’ drop
the gloves?

56:32.606 --> 56:34.303
You wanna go? Let'’s go.

56:38.917 --> 56:40.788
When it comes to
special effects

56:40.832 --> 56:43.008
in the movies today,
the question really isn'’t

56:43.051 --> 56:46.925
what can they do, the question
is what can'’t they do?

56:46.968 --> 56:49.362
For the most part, I like having
fun and having a good laugh.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.146
Cartoons are what
got me into this thing.

56:51.190 --> 56:53.279
Animation supervisor
Steve Williams,

56:53.322 --> 56:55.716
whose credits include
The Abyss and Jurassic Park

56:55.760 --> 56:58.240
has been a cartoon buff
all his life.

56:58.284 --> 57:02.114
After Jurassic,
I just didn'’t give a crap.

57:02.157 --> 57:03.724
Everybody can go
fuck themselves.

57:04.943 --> 57:07.075
These are the fuckin'’
good days, man.

57:08.250 --> 57:10.949
He was uncontrollable.

57:10.992 --> 57:15.954
This masculine, tough guy
that could not be harnessed.

57:16.563 --> 57:19.131
That was kinda my first
experience working with him.

57:19.784 --> 57:22.134
When you are in Steve'’s orbit,

57:22.961 --> 57:26.443
it was like you were
in the spotlight with him.

57:27.792 --> 57:30.751
You knew if you were
gonna be in his company

57:30.795 --> 57:33.928
that you were gonna feel like
the queen of the world.

57:35.495 --> 57:37.628
We grew to fall in love
with each other.

57:38.977 --> 57:42.459
We started a relationship
that was very intense.

57:43.024 --> 57:46.767
We wanted to start a family
and I moved up to Marin

57:46.811 --> 57:49.509
from the city and it was like
boom, boom, boom.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.468
I'’m starting the clock.
It'’s supposed to be--

57:51.511 --> 57:53.078
I'’m totally shaking.

57:53.121 --> 57:54.645
It's supposed
to be two minutes.

57:54.688 --> 57:55.776
Okay,
I just peed on that thing.

57:55.820 --> 57:57.343
It'’s fucking pink!

57:57.386 --> 57:58.910
I know, I don'’t believe it!

57:58.953 --> 58:00.085
I think you did it.

58:00.128 --> 58:01.695
You big stud!

58:01.739 --> 58:03.480
You big stud!
You did it!

58:03.523 --> 58:05.046
We never got married.

58:05.090 --> 58:07.005
We'’re gonna be
like hippies, man.

58:07.048 --> 58:09.094
Not get married and have a kid,
and it was great, you know?

58:11.879 --> 58:13.925
Hannah came along
and that was a new world,

58:13.968 --> 58:15.187
that'’s for sure.

58:16.971 --> 58:19.278
You think you know it all,
but this door gets opened.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.628
Fatherhood.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.762
What do you got, Hannah?
Tell me about your new car.

58:24.805 --> 58:26.633
Um, I don'’t want to.

58:26.677 --> 58:28.505
Okay, are you gonna
take it for a drive now?

58:34.598 --> 58:36.469
It'’s really easy to hold on

58:36.513 --> 58:39.559
to those perfect experiences

58:39.603 --> 58:41.082
or a perfect time
in your life

58:41.126 --> 58:42.954
or when
"“everything was better."

58:44.999 --> 58:47.045
The movie making world changed.

58:48.437 --> 58:50.352
He was right there, you know?

58:50.396 --> 58:52.529
He was on the frontlines
of doing that.

58:52.572 --> 58:55.532
Dippé and me
in a meat locker!

58:55.575 --> 58:56.968
"The revolution is them."

58:59.492 --> 59:01.538
Jurassicopened
the doors for all movies,

59:02.016 --> 59:03.583
so it transformed filmmaking.

59:03.627 --> 59:06.194
Everybody wanted digital.

59:06.238 --> 59:08.545
Computer graphics
was the hot, new thing.

59:12.157 --> 59:13.332
After Jurassic Park,

59:14.028 --> 59:15.552
filmmaking went off the rails.

59:15.595 --> 59:17.292
Computers allowed them to--

59:17.945 --> 59:20.513
to make these spectacles.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.516
Producers are always looking
for the magic ticket,

59:23.560 --> 59:26.258
the secret button,
and they suddenly said

59:26.301 --> 59:28.347
if it'’s got digital effects,

59:28.390 --> 59:30.436
that'’s the button you press
that makes a gazillion bucks.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.656
They think
the more of this little thing

59:32.699 --> 59:35.310
that'’s great, you know,
and by increasing it

59:35.354 --> 59:37.312
in these films, it'’s gonna
make the film better,

59:37.356 --> 59:38.749
and it hasn'’t, it's actually
destroyed filmmaking.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.446
More junk,
more junk, more junk,

59:40.489 --> 59:42.187
faster, more junk,
more junk--

59:46.104 --> 59:50.108
A successful movie is built
on a triangle.

59:50.151 --> 59:53.198
You have art, on another point
you have technology,

59:53.241 --> 59:55.461
and the other part
you have business.

59:55.504 --> 59:58.638
And if any side gets
too big or too small,

59:58.682 --> 1:00:00.727
the motion picture will suffer.

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:05.645
And it became more about
style over substance.

1:00:05.689 --> 1:00:08.648
We saw all kinds
of horrible movies

1:00:08.692 --> 1:00:10.389
with lots of visual effects.

1:00:10.432 --> 1:00:11.695
You know
what we got rewarded for?

1:00:11.738 --> 1:00:13.653
For fuckin'’ Jurassic Park?

1:00:13.697 --> 1:00:15.612
Casper the Friendly Ghost.

1:00:15.655 --> 1:00:17.178
I hated Casperwhen it was 2D.

1:00:17.526 --> 1:00:19.790
Uh, Hi?

1:00:19.833 --> 1:00:24.533
The concept became, "Let'’s redo
everything digitally,"

1:00:24.577 --> 1:00:26.710
right, that was done
in a two-dimensional medium.

1:00:26.753 --> 1:00:28.407
I mean, if you look at
something like Scooby Doo,

1:00:28.668 --> 1:00:33.325
this ridiculously
stupid-looking cartoon dog,

1:00:34.195 --> 1:00:38.286
it'’s like, "No! That thing
does not exist in our world!

1:00:38.330 --> 1:00:41.202
I refuse to believe it!
Take it away!"

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:46.991
♪ Through the

1:00:47.034 --> 1:00:49.080
This was the period when

1:00:49.123 --> 1:00:52.736
motion pictures stopped
being director-controlled

1:00:52.779 --> 1:00:54.563
and started becoming
corporate-driven.

1:00:55.173 --> 1:00:57.175
And this was
the beginning of the end.

1:00:59.481 --> 1:01:01.266
The corporations have
just kind of

1:01:01.309 --> 1:01:02.571
taken everything over.

1:01:03.442 --> 1:01:05.400
And fucked everything up.

1:01:06.097 --> 1:01:07.185
And...

1:01:07.881 --> 1:01:10.014
But they can still sell,
you know,

1:01:10.057 --> 1:01:12.059
lots of Coca-Cola, you know?

1:01:12.103 --> 1:01:13.365
And...

1:01:14.409 --> 1:01:15.976
crummy superhero movies.

1:01:18.239 --> 1:01:20.938
Because of the success of Mask

1:01:20.981 --> 1:01:23.941
we ended up producing
a very popular comic

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:25.377
at the time called Spawn.

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:32.645
That was Mark and my foray

1:01:32.689 --> 1:01:34.821
to getting into
making our own films.

1:01:35.126 --> 1:01:38.216
So, we leave ILM, boom.
Gone, you know?

1:01:38.259 --> 1:01:39.608
Then we end up
hiring back the company

1:01:39.652 --> 1:01:40.740
to do the visual effects.

1:01:57.801 --> 1:01:59.498
♪ Out came the sun

1:01:59.541 --> 1:02:02.327
After Spawn, I don'’t have a
job.

1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:04.068
No job.

1:02:05.765 --> 1:02:07.985
So, I was asked
to do the visual effects

1:02:08.028 --> 1:02:10.683
on The Hulkat ILM.

1:02:12.250 --> 1:02:14.861

"How much more of this
do we have to take?"

1:02:32.052 --> 1:02:34.881
Gone from ILM, kicked out.

1:02:34.925 --> 1:02:36.578

1:02:50.027 --> 1:02:54.509

for many of us

1:02:55.293 --> 1:02:56.903
soon became something

1:02:56.947 --> 1:02:59.688
that I felt
he needed to outgrow.

1:03:02.604 --> 1:03:03.867

that I don'’t change.

1:03:13.615 --> 1:03:15.617
Always. Right or wrong.

-From changing.

He was really good
in the therapy sessions and...

1:03:34.854 --> 1:03:36.987
the moment
we got home he was like,

1:03:37.030 --> 1:03:38.815
"“Oh, fuck that shit, you know,
I'’m not gonna change, you know,

1:03:38.858 --> 1:03:40.729

this is who I am,

1:03:45.996 --> 1:03:49.521
"Well, let'’s give it some time
and maybe he will change."

Hannah discovers I'm gone,

no extra hands--

it'’s a good thing if I have

1:04:03.361 --> 1:04:04.884

What? I'’m sorry.

Steve decided to take
his career in a new direction,

1:04:44.402 --> 1:04:46.012
so he was off feature films

1:04:46.056 --> 1:04:47.971
and he was starting
to direct commercials.

1:04:50.974 --> 1:04:52.801
Blockbuster campaign.

1:04:52.845 --> 1:04:53.933
It was very successful.

1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:57.981
We get approached by Disney,
who has a film called

1:04:58.024 --> 1:05:01.593
The Wild, and so we end up
working on this movie.

1:05:02.507 --> 1:05:05.162
2003, I was working
as an assistant editor

1:05:05.205 --> 1:05:06.337

1:05:06.380 --> 1:05:07.816
Hello, Spaz!

1:05:09.166 --> 1:05:12.386
I was just so in love
with Steve.

unique, fun,
creative place to be.

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:36.715

1:05:53.079 --> 1:05:55.168
it was really hard
for those of us

1:05:55.212 --> 1:05:56.691
on the film to get work

1:05:56.735 --> 1:05:59.390
because the film
was so poorly received.

1:05:59.433 --> 1:06:01.740
It was a drag. It was a drag.

1:06:01.783 --> 1:06:03.916
And then, so, I went back
to commercials again.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.831
Which one would be better,

1:06:05.874 --> 1:06:08.529

The commercials,
those dried up.

relatively new to the game.

And, uh,
they moved on very quickly

1:06:55.489 --> 1:06:58.405
to wanting to direct
their own stuff.

1:06:59.102 --> 1:07:02.235
So, they moved into
a whole 'nother zone

1:07:02.279 --> 1:07:04.107

didn'’t come back.

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:09.199

You know,
you just get forgotten.

1:07:28.131 --> 1:07:29.523
I reapplied to ILM.

All of those feelings, like,
just completely resurfaced

1:08:16.744 --> 1:08:18.224
and he didn'’t know
how to handle it.

1:08:22.141 --> 1:08:25.231
It was a snowball of...

1:08:26.232 --> 1:08:29.061
bad memories, guilt,

1:08:29.105 --> 1:08:31.672
lack of clarity
about certain things.

1:08:34.284 --> 1:08:36.895
He just started drinking more.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.160
It'’s a way to cover up

1:08:41.204 --> 1:08:42.814
all the things
you feel shitty about.

1:08:44.990 --> 1:08:46.774
We were down at the pub
every single day,

1:08:46.818 --> 1:08:48.863
drinking for about three hours
every night and then

1:08:48.907 --> 1:08:52.867
that sort of grew into drinking
before we went to the pub,

1:08:52.911 --> 1:08:55.348
and, um, just getting into,

1:08:55.392 --> 1:08:58.395
just the worst knock down,
drag-out,

1:08:58.438 --> 1:09:01.398
awful fights when we got home.

1:09:03.051 --> 1:09:04.575
So, I finally
worked up the courage

1:09:04.618 --> 1:09:05.837
to walk into an AA meeting.

1:09:06.794 --> 1:09:10.058
You go, you keep going back,
and I got sober,

1:09:10.102 --> 1:09:12.974
I stayed sober and, I'’m gonna
sound like an AA thumper,

1:09:13.018 --> 1:09:14.933
but by the grace of God
I'’m still sober

1:09:14.976 --> 1:09:17.196
and my marriage fell apart.

1:09:19.546 --> 1:09:21.461
I knew
that if I didn'’t move out,

1:09:21.505 --> 1:09:22.723
I wouldn'’t stay sober.

1:09:23.811 --> 1:09:26.118
It'’s common where...

1:09:26.771 --> 1:09:29.730
two alcoholics, one gets sober
and the other doesn'’t.

1:09:31.079 --> 1:09:33.169
Well, I thought
we were doin'’ okay.

1:09:41.655 --> 1:09:43.266
Ellen, please, I--

1:09:52.362 --> 1:09:55.234
She left to light a fire

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:57.889
under my dad'’s ass, like, "“Hey,
you gotta clean up your act

1:09:57.932 --> 1:09:59.238
or I'’m gone for good."

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:02.807
The train was goin'’
200 miles an hour.

1:10:03.547 --> 1:10:05.505
I was either gonna go
into the wall with it,

1:10:05.549 --> 1:10:07.159
or I was gonna get off

1:10:07.638 --> 1:10:11.207
and hope that Steve could get
off before it-- it killed him.

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:13.426
So, I think she wanted
to scare him a little bit.

1:10:15.036 --> 1:10:16.777
And it only made it worse.

1:10:24.045 --> 1:10:25.873
Boredom is destructive.

1:15:49.588 --> 1:15:51.459
I wouldn'’t be standing here
if I had not made

1:15:51.503 --> 1:15:53.157
that decision eight months ago.

1:15:54.767 --> 1:15:56.116
Um...

1:15:57.857 --> 1:15:59.076
It'’s a lot quieter.

1:15:59.903 --> 1:16:01.600
I'’ve sort of shut down
all the old ways,

1:16:01.644 --> 1:16:03.515
all the old places,
all the old people.

1:16:04.385 --> 1:16:06.431
You know?
Now, I'’m just stuck with me.

1:16:08.172 --> 1:16:09.303
Which is good and bad.

1:16:11.262 --> 1:16:13.569
I have to be very careful
because beer was used

1:16:13.612 --> 1:16:16.702
to run away from myself
and I have myself only

1:16:16.746 --> 1:16:18.486
and I have to be
very, very careful.

1:16:19.966 --> 1:16:23.491
You know, I always occupy
my mind with things to do.

1:16:24.405 --> 1:16:25.493
That''’s the most important
thing.

1:16:26.973 --> 1:16:30.150
Even if it includes something
so simple as doing the dishes.

1:16:34.198 --> 1:16:36.113
Being an adult
is a very strange thing.

1:16:38.855 --> 1:16:40.596
But looking in the mirror,

1:16:40.639 --> 1:16:42.162
you'’re not frightened
of yourself anymore.

1:16:44.687 --> 1:16:46.297
So, where the journey'’s gonna
take me now,

1:16:46.340 --> 1:16:47.646
I don'’t know.

1:16:47.690 --> 1:16:49.779
At 57, that'’s a good question.

1:16:51.694 --> 1:16:54.174
This is kind of like
being at a bus depot

1:16:54.697 --> 1:16:56.307
and the next bus
that comes along,

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:58.091
you don'’t know where it's going.

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:00.746
But, while you'’re at the depot,
you get to pick up

1:17:00.790 --> 1:17:02.226
some of your old hobbies

1:17:02.269 --> 1:17:04.750
that you enjoyed
and not have the threat

1:17:04.794 --> 1:17:07.579
of taking your finger off
''‘cause you'’ve had a six-pack.

1:17:10.713 --> 1:17:14.064
He'’s a lot more self-aware now.

1:17:14.107 --> 1:17:16.327
And he'’s a lot more aware

1:17:16.370 --> 1:17:19.765
of I'’d say,
people and their needs.

1:17:22.463 --> 1:17:24.030
I think the pain

1:17:24.727 --> 1:17:28.556
of certain things in his life
will never go away.

1:17:30.167 --> 1:17:33.387
But he still has
so much to give.

1:17:34.388 --> 1:17:37.130
Welcome to the expert series.

1:17:37.174 --> 1:17:39.002
We have, uh, Steve Williams,

1:17:39.045 --> 1:17:42.875
he'’s here to share
with you his expertise.

1:17:45.269 --> 1:17:47.967
You guys are gonna have
a good time, he'’s a lot of fun.

1:17:48.011 --> 1:17:49.708
The thing
about being an artist

1:17:49.752 --> 1:17:51.362
I want you guys to remember
is that everytime

1:17:51.405 --> 1:17:55.148
there's plotted out path
for you and rules,

1:17:55.192 --> 1:17:56.889
-fuckin'’ break ''‘em, right?

1:17:56.933 --> 1:17:58.717
-Yes!
-And remember,

1:17:58.761 --> 1:18:01.459
art is always about
questioning established systems.

1:18:03.504 --> 1:18:05.724
To continue to be relevant,

1:18:05.768 --> 1:18:07.900
that'’s what we all want.

1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.860
Is to have some kind of
body of experience

1:18:10.903 --> 1:18:13.906
that'’s going to educate
and inspire other people.

1:18:15.125 --> 1:18:16.779
That'’s the gift
of getting older.

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:20.870
You allow yourself
to make mistakes,

1:18:20.913 --> 1:18:22.349
like, really big mistakes.

1:18:23.481 --> 1:18:27.050
Going to the wrong door
and finding your way out.

1:18:27.093 --> 1:18:29.443
That'’s where the gold is.

1:18:29.487 --> 1:18:31.663
When you say pioneers,
it makes you think of

1:18:31.707 --> 1:18:33.230
a certain spirit of a person

1:18:33.273 --> 1:18:34.753
that'’s willing to go out
and risk it all

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:36.494
and-- and go for it.

1:18:36.537 --> 1:18:38.278
Face whatever dangers
they'’re gonna face

1:18:38.322 --> 1:18:41.804
and be willing to try to fail
at things and, uh,

1:18:41.847 --> 1:18:44.241
take it to the next level.

1:18:44.937 --> 1:18:46.634
I don'’t know
when there'’s going to be

1:18:46.678 --> 1:18:48.985
another breakthrough

1:18:49.028 --> 1:18:53.163
that is as transformative
as making the transition

1:18:53.206 --> 1:18:55.905
from old-school effects
to digital effects.

1:18:56.601 --> 1:18:59.256
Is new ground
being broken today?

1:18:59.299 --> 1:19:01.911
Yeah, but experimentation

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:05.958
is left to scrappier,
upstart maverick people.

1:19:06.002 --> 1:19:08.918
We'’re all believers
in our point of view.

1:19:08.961 --> 1:19:10.397
Even though you have
a lot of talent

1:19:10.441 --> 1:19:12.530
and you're very passionate

1:19:12.573 --> 1:19:14.837
it'’s still not easy to survive
or to succeed in this world.

1:19:21.582 --> 1:19:23.019
In some ways,

1:19:23.715 --> 1:19:26.152
talented people are talented

1:19:26.196 --> 1:19:28.589
because they are able

1:19:28.633 --> 1:19:35.379
to stay in touch with sort of
a childish nature in them.

1:19:36.859 --> 1:19:41.646
Your ability to touch
pure reactions to things

1:19:41.689 --> 1:19:45.041
are kind of like seeing
the world for the first time.

1:19:46.782 --> 1:19:50.655
Anyone who can draw
on that kind of

1:19:50.698 --> 1:19:54.398
childish thinking
has the opportunity

1:19:54.441 --> 1:19:55.965
for greatness in them.
