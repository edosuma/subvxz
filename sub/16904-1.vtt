WEBVTT

00:04.100 --> 00:06.368
- Lemon, it's Jack.
- Who's Jackie?

00:06.436 --> 00:07.970
Oh, Lemon, Avery and I
just got back

00:08.037 --> 00:11.639
from the most amazing vacation
on Paul Allen's yacht.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.675
And for four glorious weeks,

00:13.742 --> 00:16.410
my naturally blonde
lady love and I basked

00:16.478 --> 00:17.911
in the three "s"s...

00:17.979 --> 00:20.280
surf, sun, and...
Sandwiches?

00:20.348 --> 00:23.019
Heh, we didn't need
sandwiches, Lemon.

00:23.135 --> 00:25.520
It was so warm you could pick
fully cooked lobsters

00:25.621 --> 00:26.656
out of the water.

00:26.724 --> 00:28.421
Sheer bliss.

00:28.488 --> 00:31.246
Avery is the most perfect woman
ever created.

00:31.314 --> 00:35.246
Like a young bo Derek
stuffed with a Barry goldwater.

00:35.314 --> 00:37.455
You sound weird.
Do you have a beard?

00:37.542 --> 00:40.563
Not for long.
It's back to reality.

00:40.630 --> 00:42.312
No more making love
on the beach

00:42.380 --> 00:45.121
surrounded by a privacy circle
of English-trained butlers.

00:45.189 --> 00:46.502
But I've got to get out
of island mode

00:46.570 --> 00:47.928
and back into work mode.

00:47.995 --> 00:49.952
How was your summer?

00:50.020 --> 00:53.054
Get this, my gynecologist
committed suicide.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.699
And I'm back!

00:56.832 --> 00:59.117
Carol!

00:59.185 --> 01:01.003
Hey, Lizzie,
I'm about to take off.

01:01.071 --> 01:02.279
I'm in lambert, St. Louis,

01:02.347 --> 01:04.165
and I can see the arch
from here.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.158
No, wait, actually that's
a half-burned-down McDonald's.

01:07.225 --> 01:10.316
Anyway, weather's great,
and I just have to go

01:10.384 --> 01:12.973
St. Louis-Newark,
Newark-Atlantic city,

01:13.040 --> 01:14.888
Atlantic city to Newark,
and then I'll be there.

01:14.955 --> 01:17.236
Who flies Newark
to Atlantic city?

01:17.304 --> 01:19.351
Black bachelorette parties.
Gotta go.

01:22.173 --> 01:24.959
Hello?

01:25.027 --> 01:27.873
Yo, I'm calling to say
that I'm giving you

01:27.941 --> 01:29.719
110% this year.

01:29.787 --> 01:32.070
I'm relaxed, I'm focused,

01:32.138 --> 01:33.710
and I'm gonna be churning out
the good stuff

01:33.778 --> 01:35.955
like you've never seen.
That's great, Tracy.

01:36.028 --> 01:37.566
Oh, I misdialed.

01:37.634 --> 01:39.377
I thought I was calling
my nutritionist.

01:39.445 --> 01:41.556
Good-bye.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.800
Okay, season five.
Here we go.

01:46.851 --> 01:56.923
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:03.565 --> 02:04.598
What about office supplies?

02:04.666 --> 02:05.965
Can you come down 5% there?

02:06.033 --> 02:07.400
I'll try.

02:07.467 --> 02:08.800
We're already printing
all of our internal memos

02:08.868 --> 02:10.535
on the back of my kids' art.

02:10.603 --> 02:13.438
In order for this merger
to stay attractive

02:13.505 --> 02:15.973
to our friends at Kabletown,
we have to seem like

02:16.041 --> 02:17.708
a sexy, profitable company.

02:17.776 --> 02:19.409
And we're almost
pulling it off.

02:19.477 --> 02:21.911
<i>The Harry Potter theme park
is a huge hit</i>

02:21.979 --> 02:24.580
with both anglophiles
and pedophiles.

02:24.648 --> 02:26.348
The movie division has
a James Cameron movie

02:26.416 --> 02:28.083
the whole world will see,
whether they like it or not.

02:28.151 --> 02:31.819
Only NBC continues to be
the engorged whitehead

02:31.887 --> 02:34.088
on the otherwise flawless face
of universal media.

02:34.156 --> 02:37.324
Lemon, why are you spending
so much money on wigs?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.659
Tracy's head size
keeps changing.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.728
Hang on, what is this
pay increase for Jenna?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.063
Oh, boy.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.666
<i>Look, as we enter
the fifth season of TGS...</i>

02:47.733 --> 02:49.334
and remember, no one ever
thought we'd make it this far...

02:49.401 --> 02:50.568
I believed in us.

02:50.636 --> 02:52.169
That was actually an oversight.

02:52.237 --> 02:54.004
Jenna has some crazy stuff
built into her contract

02:54.072 --> 02:55.272
that kicks in now.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.440
Like what?

02:57.508 --> 02:58.541
Eye contact.

02:58.609 --> 03:00.076
"Everyone must make eye contact

03:00.143 --> 03:02.978
with Miss Maroney
at all times."

03:03.046 --> 03:04.613
She also gets a producer credit.
What?

03:04.681 --> 03:05.914
Oh, it's just
a vanity credit, Lemon.

03:05.982 --> 03:08.183
A low-cost way to make someone
feel more important.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.685
Like executive producer
Ashton Kutcher,

03:10.753 --> 03:12.820
or secretary of state
Hillary Clinton.

03:12.887 --> 03:17.258
Am I late
for the producers meeting?

03:17.325 --> 03:20.160
Eye contact.

03:20.227 --> 03:21.794
Thank you.

03:21.862 --> 03:24.863
- Hey, k-k-k-k.

03:24.931 --> 03:26.531
First day back's
gonna be a busy one.

03:26.599 --> 03:29.535
First, I need you to go
to the dry cleaners for me

03:29.603 --> 03:31.471
and find out
how martinizing works.

03:31.539 --> 03:33.707
I've always been curious.

03:33.775 --> 03:35.209
Then I need you
to be back by noon

03:35.276 --> 03:36.743
to make the bathroom smell
like sandalwood

03:36.811 --> 03:37.877
before I wreck it.

03:37.945 --> 03:39.779
You got that,
k-pax-o-gum?

03:39.847 --> 03:43.181
I'm not Kenneth, sir.

03:43.249 --> 03:44.382
My name's Brian.

03:44.450 --> 03:47.551
Kenneth got fired
at the end of last season.

03:47.619 --> 03:49.685
Of course.
I knew that.

03:52.521 --> 03:55.023
Good meeting.

03:55.091 --> 03:57.458
- So how are things with Carol?
- Good.

03:57.526 --> 03:59.126
Did you know that
if you're a pilot,

03:59.194 --> 04:00.694
that chili's will seat you
right away,

04:00.761 --> 04:02.561
even if the pilot's
dinner companion

04:02.629 --> 04:04.462
has just been yelling
at the hostess?

04:04.530 --> 04:06.564
You are the Jackie o
of our time.

04:06.631 --> 04:08.866
And pilots get
all these travel points

04:08.933 --> 04:10.500
at Starwind hotels.

04:10.568 --> 04:12.135
The one in midtown has
free Internet.

04:12.202 --> 04:14.636
He doesn't stay with you
when he's here?

04:14.704 --> 04:16.471
<i>Why would he?
Those Starwinds are nice!</i>

04:16.539 --> 04:27.946
I mean, the bathtubs are
so much cleaner than at home.

04:28.014 --> 04:29.962
It's almost as bad
as "climax."

04:30.030 --> 04:32.181
You can't just do
the vacation part.

04:32.249 --> 04:34.333
At some point you have to
go home to the same house,

04:35.001 --> 04:37.628
unpack your dirty laundry,
and have a life together.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.155
Then one of you says,
"we should redecorate."

04:40.223 --> 04:42.041
And the other one says,
"please, Avery,

04:42.109 --> 04:43.851
I'm using the commode
right now."

04:43.894 --> 04:45.845
Ooh, she wants to redecorate?
She just moved in.

04:45.913 --> 04:48.498
Avery, uh, has opinions.
I love her for that.

04:48.566 --> 04:50.082
Unfortunately,
she wants to repaint

04:50.150 --> 04:52.167
the upstairs hallway
in a strie faux finish

04:52.235 --> 04:53.544
called "husk."

04:53.611 --> 04:55.396
I prefer the color
that's already there...

04:55.464 --> 04:58.023
a reddish-brown shade
called "elk tongue."

04:58.091 --> 04:59.508
So tell her no.
It's your house.

04:59.575 --> 05:01.318
This is how I know
you've never had

05:01.385 --> 05:02.502
an adult relationship.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.188
If I say no,
then I will be required

05:05.256 --> 05:07.040
to say yes to something else
in the future,

05:07.108 --> 05:08.691
and the stakes in the future
might be higher.

05:08.759 --> 05:11.011
- Then say yes.
- If I give in,

05:11.079 --> 05:12.297
then I'm no longer the Alpha
in my house.

05:12.365 --> 05:13.907
Before you know it,
she'll have me wearing jeans

05:13.975 --> 05:14.950
and reading fiction!

05:15.018 --> 05:17.076
Yeah, well, yes and no
are kind of

05:17.144 --> 05:18.452
your only two choices.

05:18.520 --> 05:21.581
For most men, sure.
But there is a third option.

05:21.648 --> 05:24.309
The Fabian strategy.
I know this.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.794
If an apple and a feather
fall at the same time...

05:26.861 --> 05:28.746
the Fabian strategy
derives its name

05:28.814 --> 05:32.207
from the Roman general
Quintus Fabius Maximus.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.367
He ran away, Lemon.
Rather than engage in battle,

05:34.435 --> 05:36.853
he would retreat and retreat
until the enemy grew fatigued

05:37.321 --> 05:38.529
and eventually made a mistake.

05:38.597 --> 05:41.124
Although I abhor it
as a military strategy,

05:41.191 --> 05:44.526
it is the basis for all of my,
uh, personal relationships.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.578
So Avery is your enemy.
That sounds healthy.

05:47.646 --> 05:49.497
You're in no position to judge.

05:49.564 --> 05:51.482
Meeting someone in a hotel room
twice a month

05:51.550 --> 05:54.143
is not a relationship...
just ask any hooker.

05:54.210 --> 05:56.261
Oh, stop saying "relationship"!

05:56.328 --> 05:57.403
I'm sorry,

05:57.471 --> 05:59.123
I was going to say "climax."
Aah!

06:00.467 --> 06:01.784
A line item budget.

06:01.852 --> 06:04.579
Oh, I love this.

06:04.646 --> 06:07.940
It takes people and turns them
into amounts of money.

06:08.008 --> 06:11.169
Except for Tracy,
I'm the most person on the show!

06:11.236 --> 06:12.820
At do we do now?

06:12.888 --> 06:15.748
Oh, okay, well, Jack wants me
to keep the budget flat,

06:15.816 --> 06:17.400
but I don't want
to deny people their raises.

06:17.468 --> 06:19.418
You should fire grace
from wardrobe.

06:19.486 --> 06:21.570
She doesn't do anything.
Fire grace?

06:21.638 --> 06:23.189
Come on, you'd have to be
a heartless monster...

06:23.256 --> 06:25.007
I'll do it.

06:25.075 --> 06:28.593
Grace, your position
has been terminated,

06:29.161 --> 06:30.444
effective immediately.

06:30.512 --> 06:34.682
<i>But I've been here
since the Jack Paar show.</i>

06:34.749 --> 06:35.891
Your health insurance will
remain in effect

06:35.959 --> 06:37.276
until the end of this sentence.

06:37.344 --> 06:39.428
Come on. Chop chop.

06:43.666 --> 06:45.651
What a shank job.

06:45.718 --> 06:48.145
Kenneth,
I knew you'd come back!

06:48.213 --> 06:50.230
Let me smell your head.

06:50.298 --> 06:51.173
Mmm...
Come on!

06:51.241 --> 06:52.549
This is a woman's blazer

06:52.617 --> 06:55.344
from a very expensive
blazer shop called Rico's.

06:55.412 --> 06:58.173
I'm sorry, but my heart is
playing tricks on my eyes.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.558
Just like my kidneys did
to my lungs that time.

07:00.601 --> 07:01.843
Are you okay?

07:01.911 --> 07:03.453
I keep hallucinating Kenneth.

07:03.496 --> 07:04.838
Am I going crazy again?

07:04.906 --> 07:06.823
Should I get my rainbow wig
out of storage?

07:06.891 --> 07:08.776
No, Tracy, it's normal.

07:08.843 --> 07:11.537
Kenneth was very special
to you, and now he's gone.

07:11.605 --> 07:14.123
The next time you hallucinate,
just tell yourself,

07:14.191 --> 07:16.617
"this is not real.
I am in control of this."

07:17.185 --> 07:19.369
Like the world cup.

07:19.437 --> 07:21.055
I'll try.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.109
â™ª â™ª

07:30.573 --> 07:33.708
No, this place is
too full of memories.

07:33.776 --> 07:35.994
I gotta clear my head.

07:36.062 --> 07:38.246
Okay, well, we've only been
back to work, like, an hour...

07:38.314 --> 07:42.051
And bye.

07:42.119 --> 07:43.703
Liz, get in on this.

07:43.771 --> 07:46.932
Would you rather have to
start every sentence you say

07:47.000 --> 07:49.861
for the rest of your life
with Urkel's catchphrase,

07:49.929 --> 07:51.137
"Did I do that?"

07:52.205 --> 07:55.907
Or be siamese twins
with Sharon Stone for a year?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.469
Did I do that?

07:58.537 --> 07:59.812
Carol!

07:59.880 --> 08:01.431
So, Carol,

08:01.498 --> 08:04.026
you ever join
the mile high club?

08:04.093 --> 08:07.488
Try five miles high.
And no, I have not.

08:07.556 --> 08:09.307
Did you ever see
a UFO up there?

08:09.375 --> 08:11.126
No, but once,
when I was in the air force,

08:11.194 --> 08:12.336
I saw Mr. t in a pizza hut.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.088
<i>Was the air force
like top gun?</i>

08:14.156 --> 08:15.706
Yeah, but with
a lot more volleyball.

08:15.774 --> 08:16.815
You ever kill anyone?

08:16.883 --> 08:18.737
Sucked a mechanic
into my engine once.

08:18.805 --> 08:21.641
Are you on Facebook?

08:26.558 --> 08:28.839
And these are for you.

08:28.907 --> 08:32.509
Passenger left them
in the first-class lavatory.

08:32.577 --> 08:33.543
Ooh.

08:33.611 --> 08:34.578
Hey, I couldn't get a room

08:34.645 --> 08:36.013
at any of the Starwinds
this weekend.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.748
You think it'd be all right
if I stayed at your place?

08:37.816 --> 08:40.217
Uh... uh, yeah. Of course.

08:40.284 --> 08:42.219
I'll just have to
run home first

08:42.287 --> 08:43.821
and take some plates
out of the bathroom.

08:43.888 --> 08:44.922
But it would be nice

08:44.989 --> 08:46.256
staying together
at your place, right?

08:46.324 --> 08:49.993
Yeah, it'll be a fun...
Step for us.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.328
I just can't believe that
every Starwind suite

08:51.396 --> 08:52.729
in the city is taken.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.331
Me neither. The lady said
they're all booked up

08:54.398 --> 08:58.334
for something called jackfest.

08:58.402 --> 09:00.202
How many rooms did you book?

09:00.270 --> 09:01.871
It's for your own good, Lemon.

09:01.938 --> 09:03.272
I just want you to have
what Avery and I have.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.473
I am a grown woman.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.574
I have been doing things
my way for a long time.

09:06.642 --> 09:10.076
I don't like my life stuff
mixing with my dude stuff.

09:10.143 --> 09:12.543
- A middle-aged woman
saying "dude stuff"...

09:12.611 --> 09:15.509
is that on my sadness
scavenger hunt?

09:15.577 --> 09:18.043
Why, yes, it is.

09:18.111 --> 09:20.211
Carol and I enjoy

09:20.278 --> 09:22.144
our separate-but-intersecting
lifestyles.

09:22.212 --> 09:23.412
It's perfect.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.112
I'm like that woman
on the food network

09:25.180 --> 09:27.347
whose husband only comes home
on the weekends,

09:27.414 --> 09:28.847
and she spends the rest
of her time

09:28.915 --> 09:30.615
eating and drinking
with her gay friends.

09:30.682 --> 09:32.415
<i>Her name is
the Barefoot Contessa, Lemon,</i>

09:32.483 --> 09:33.948
and you will never be like her,

09:34.015 --> 09:35.680
starting with
the barefoot part.

09:35.748 --> 09:37.912
I'll have you know that
I wore sandals this summer,

09:37.980 --> 09:41.847
over socks...In a dream.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.181
<i>Welcome to the late show
with David letterman.</i>

09:45.249 --> 09:46.782
Please have your tickets out.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.951
And now, as with all
studio audiences,

09:49.018 --> 09:52.053
we will sort you
according to attractiveness.

09:52.121 --> 09:53.454
Front, front, back,

09:53.522 --> 09:56.724
balcony, front, front...

09:56.791 --> 09:58.024
Mr. Jordan!

09:58.092 --> 10:01.294
No, you do not exist!

10:01.362 --> 10:03.096
I'm in control of this!

10:05.499 --> 10:08.067
Want to watch TV?

10:08.135 --> 10:09.201
First thing you need
is tequila...

10:09.269 --> 10:10.536
Stop. Wait. No.

10:10.603 --> 10:12.137
<i>The Barefoot Contessa...
I love this show.</i>

10:12.205 --> 10:13.438
Me too.

10:13.506 --> 10:15.707
This is one of the three things
in the world I like...

10:15.774 --> 10:17.709
Ina Garten, sweater weather,
and...

10:17.776 --> 10:19.043
When Muppets present
at award shows?

10:19.111 --> 10:21.579
- Wow, yes!
- Me too.

10:21.647 --> 10:24.282
We really see eye to eye
on a lot of stuff, don't we?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.550
Absolutely. I've never
met anyone before

10:25.618 --> 10:26.985
who had the exact
same idea as me

10:27.053 --> 10:28.220
about what to do
with Palestine.

10:28.287 --> 10:30.421
- It would work, right?
- Of course it would work.

10:30.489 --> 10:32.856
And don't you agree
that our situation

10:32.924 --> 10:34.591
is perfect right now?

10:34.658 --> 10:36.426
We have these great visits
together,

10:36.493 --> 10:38.160
but then we still have
our separate lives.

10:38.228 --> 10:42.631
We're like Jeffrey and Ina.

10:42.699 --> 10:47.802
No, no, I can't...
I can't live like this anymore.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.405
I'm not like Jeffrey Garten.

10:50.472 --> 10:52.406
I'm not as strong as that guy!

10:52.474 --> 10:54.608
Don't have too much fun
without me, okay?

10:54.676 --> 10:57.044
I need to know where
this relationship is going,

10:57.111 --> 10:59.145
and I can feel you
resisting it.

10:59.213 --> 11:02.749
No, no...
It okay.

11:02.816 --> 11:05.851
Don't be cry.

11:05.919 --> 11:08.820
I'm a pilot, Liz.

11:08.888 --> 11:11.655
You know, I've spent
my entire adult life...

11:11.723 --> 11:15.492
just casual girlfriends
in different cities.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.295
I... I can't go from woman
to woman to woman anymore.

11:19.363 --> 11:21.263
How many women
have you been with?

11:21.331 --> 11:24.499
I'd rather not say.
It's shameful.

11:24.567 --> 11:26.800
<i>I mean, I'm a pit.</i>

11:29.604 --> 11:30.537
Six.

11:30.638 --> 11:33.872
Oh, that's not so great.

11:33.907 --> 11:35.474
- I want grown-up love!

11:37.000 --> 11:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.045 --> 11:48.314
- Hello?
- Thanks.

11:48.381 --> 11:50.249
Carol had a complete meltdown

11:50.317 --> 11:51.683
about the state
of our relationship.

11:51.751 --> 11:54.386
I can't believe I tried
to clean my bathtub for this.

11:54.454 --> 11:56.389
No, this is healthy, Lemon.
Where is Carol now?

11:56.457 --> 11:57.891
I finally got him to sleep.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.326
I had to spoon him
for, like, an hour.

11:59.393 --> 12:00.861
And I was the outer spoon.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.128
Welcome to adulthood.

12:02.196 --> 12:04.230
As for me, I have
successfully retreated

12:04.298 --> 12:05.265
for another day.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.700
When Avery got home from work,

12:06.767 --> 12:09.069
I noticed that she had
some paint samples in her purse,

12:09.137 --> 12:11.271
so I immediately asked her
if her sister had done

12:11.339 --> 12:13.540
anything crazy lately,
and guess what...She had.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.376
Avery talked about that
for about an hour,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.245
her anger eventually
transforming

12:17.313 --> 12:19.248
into some rather
interesting sex.

12:19.316 --> 12:20.717
And now she's sleeping
peacefully

12:20.784 --> 12:23.221
while Fabius has retreated
to his den,

12:23.289 --> 12:25.757
where he is drinking scotch
and playing snood.

12:25.824 --> 12:28.527
- Uh-huh. Does Avery's work
email go right to her phone?

12:28.595 --> 12:30.128
- Why?
- Nothing.

12:30.196 --> 12:31.829
Just sending her a link
to this cool site...

12:31.897 --> 12:34.032
funkyvintagewallpaper.com.

12:34.099 --> 12:36.600
Lemon, don't! She keeps
her blackberry in bed with her.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.568
- And send.
- Damn it, Lemon!

12:38.636 --> 12:40.669
It has to be elk tongue!

12:42.338 --> 12:43.872
Oh...

12:43.940 --> 12:46.041
Eww... No!

12:46.109 --> 12:47.376
This Jenna promotion
is the greatest thing

12:47.444 --> 12:48.644
that has ever happened to me.

12:48.712 --> 12:50.745
Do you understand how much
free time I have now?

12:50.812 --> 12:53.314
Yesterday, I went to the gym.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.883
And this morning,
I made love to my wife.

12:55.950 --> 12:58.151
And she was still asleep,
so I didn't have to be gentle.

13:00.021 --> 13:02.021
That's one of the most
upsetting things

13:02.089 --> 13:03.222
I have ever imagined.

13:03.288 --> 13:06.419
Are you sure?
Think about it again.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.190
Yes.

13:10.258 --> 13:13.294
Liz, the writers can't take
a car service at night anymore.

13:13.361 --> 13:15.496
I've crunched the numbers,
and it's cheaper for us

13:15.563 --> 13:18.098
to just replace anyone
who gets murdered.

13:21.469 --> 13:24.870
So did Avery like
my wallpaper idea?

13:24.938 --> 13:28.473
- She did. Heh heh.
- Huh...So why are you happy?

13:28.540 --> 13:30.942
Because the Fabian strategy
is working.

13:31.009 --> 13:33.177
Every new pattern
Avery showed me,

13:33.245 --> 13:35.447
I would simply say,
"yes, I like that one too."

13:35.515 --> 13:37.449
And she was so overwhelmed
with the choices

13:37.516 --> 13:38.750
that she made a mistake.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.619
She suggested that we consult
her old college friend,

13:41.687 --> 13:43.821
who's an interior designer.
- Uh-huh.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.156
He's coming here
to meet with me today.

13:45.223 --> 13:46.290
His name is James.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.392
Not Jim, not Jimmy...

13:48.460 --> 13:50.894
<i>Jamessss.
I get it.</i>

13:50.962 --> 13:53.597
She's sending her army
into unknown territory.

13:53.665 --> 13:58.735
And I am flanking her...
With these.

13:58.803 --> 14:00.403
Have you seen my eyes, Lemon?

14:00.471 --> 14:02.171
Yep.
They're very blue.

14:02.238 --> 14:03.572
Like a mikonos sky.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.006
Mark Foley once
called them "piercing."

14:05.074 --> 14:06.474
Hmm.

14:06.542 --> 14:08.176
Avery has really made
a misstep here.

14:08.243 --> 14:10.778
Do you know what a prize I am
in the gay community?

14:10.846 --> 14:15.549
There's a term for it.
I'm a bear...And I'm a

14:15.617 --> 14:16.783
I'm a daddy bear.

14:16.851 --> 14:19.186
Just one hour
of flirty chatting with James,

14:19.253 --> 14:20.186
and you know what I'll get.

14:20.254 --> 14:24.089
Not a Glaad award, I know that.

14:24.157 --> 14:26.758
Elk tongue.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.993
Well, I'm glad to hear that
you've almost

14:29.061 --> 14:30.795
vanquished your girlfriend.
Thank you.

14:30.863 --> 14:33.097
And you versus Carol...
how's that going?

14:33.165 --> 14:36.600
I don't know. We had
a pretty emotional breakfast.

14:40.904 --> 14:43.106
He says he's leaving early now.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.108
I don't know what to do.
I know it's difficult, Lemon.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.876
But now you have
an adult decision to make.

14:46.944 --> 14:50.779
Would you rather let go
of your precious autonomy,

14:50.847 --> 14:52.280
and let Carol into your life?

14:52.348 --> 14:55.149
Or would you rather
teach your cat to dial 911?

14:55.217 --> 14:57.517
First of all, I'm tired
of playing "would you rather."

14:57.585 --> 15:02.720
<i>And second of all, you know
that I have life alert.</i>

15:02.788 --> 15:06.056
Oh, I pushed it.
I need a phone.

15:06.123 --> 15:11.460
Mr. Jordan.
Mr. Jordan, please stop.

15:11.528 --> 15:12.995
You're not real.

15:13.063 --> 15:14.363
If I threw you
in front of a car,

15:14.430 --> 15:16.164
it would drive
right through you!

15:16.232 --> 15:18.834
No! No...Sir!

15:18.902 --> 15:20.201
I am real!

15:20.269 --> 15:22.403
Would an imaginary me know
that you have a mole

15:22.471 --> 15:25.473
on your list of pets to get?

15:25.541 --> 15:27.208
Or that your favorite color
is rainbow?

15:27.276 --> 15:30.379
<i>Of course it would.
It would know anything I knew</i>

15:30.446 --> 15:33.581
because it sprung
from my imagination.

15:35.550 --> 15:37.953
Sir, it's really me!

15:45.796 --> 15:47.862
Oh, my God!

15:47.930 --> 15:51.065
Oh, no, I missed it!
Do it again!

15:52.432 --> 15:54.433
I love you, Ken-word.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.768
<i>Why don't you come
back home to TGS</i>

15:56.836 --> 15:59.036
and pick the peas
out of my fried rice?

15:59.104 --> 16:01.102
And the rice.
I just want carrots.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.602
I can't do that, sir.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.570
But don't you miss
rubbing my foot

16:04.638 --> 16:06.105
back into the shape of a foot?

16:06.173 --> 16:07.573
Of course I do.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.642
But I'm real happy here at CBS.

16:10.710 --> 16:13.945
<i>They gave me a tote bag
with the mentalist on it!</i>

16:14.012 --> 16:18.082
- I guess this is good-bye.

16:18.149 --> 16:20.884
Obviously, I'm going to need
the tote bag.

16:26.957 --> 16:29.058
James, tell me,

16:29.126 --> 16:31.360
which one of these do you like?

16:31.427 --> 16:35.396
Because with my untrained eyes,

16:35.464 --> 16:39.967
the strie is bland,
and the, uh...

16:40.035 --> 16:42.569
Wallpaper just looks busy.

16:42.637 --> 16:45.904
Oh...I don't know.

16:48.474 --> 16:52.509
Do you see something, uh,
here that you like?

16:54.612 --> 16:59.180
It's so frustrating.

17:03.586 --> 17:07.757
â™ª â™ª

17:07.825 --> 17:09.791
I think I found a way

17:09.859 --> 17:11.327
to get the budget down
to where Jack wants it.

17:11.394 --> 17:13.762
<i>That's my girl!
You are en fuego.</i>

17:13.829 --> 17:17.832
I was looking it over,
and I've realized something.

17:17.898 --> 17:19.633
There's one too many
producers, Pete.

17:19.701 --> 17:22.502
Okay, I get it.

17:22.569 --> 17:25.238
But please...
I have five kids...

17:25.306 --> 17:26.673
That I don't want to be
at home with.

17:26.741 --> 17:30.343
No, Pete, it's me.

17:30.410 --> 17:33.645
As great as I am at this,
I'm not really necessary.

17:33.713 --> 17:35.413
Hmm, the last time I said that,

17:35.481 --> 17:38.116
I was in a three-way
with two of the backstreet boys.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.150
No, Jenna, you can't quit.

17:39.218 --> 17:40.952
I'll take a pay cut.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.353
We can fire Liz!

17:42.420 --> 17:44.721
This is hard for me too, Pete.

17:44.789 --> 17:47.089
But it's because
I'm a genius producer

17:47.157 --> 17:49.191
I know that you have to
fire me.

17:49.258 --> 17:53.027
Take my producing fee
and amortize it

17:53.095 --> 17:56.130
to cover the gaps
in transport and electric.

17:58.934 --> 18:01.168
Hey, Liz, would you rather...

18:01.236 --> 18:02.369
- Oh...
- Be with the person

18:02.437 --> 18:04.071
you love forever,

18:04.138 --> 18:05.572
but you always
have to wear a shirt

18:05.639 --> 18:06.773
made out of their pubes,

18:06.840 --> 18:09.742
or be alone
for the rest of your life,

18:09.810 --> 18:11.110
but you get to wear
whatever you want?

18:11.178 --> 18:13.278
Shirt of pubes.

18:13.346 --> 18:15.847
I thought you left.

18:15.915 --> 18:17.782
I came back.

18:17.850 --> 18:20.618
I mean, I had to kick
an obese teen off the flight

18:20.686 --> 18:22.519
to get a seat, but
I really wanted to talk to you.

18:22.587 --> 18:24.788
Look, I'm not sorry
you saw me cry.

18:24.856 --> 18:26.156
I'm an emotional guy.

18:26.223 --> 18:28.424
That's actually not even part
of my personality.

18:28.492 --> 18:30.159
That's just something
that happens to people

18:30.226 --> 18:31.827
who change altitude
more than four times a day.

18:31.895 --> 18:33.462
Is that also why you got so mad

18:33.529 --> 18:34.496
watching the giants game?

18:34.563 --> 18:35.997
No, that was because

18:36.065 --> 18:38.032
why does Geico have
three different spokespeople?

18:38.100 --> 18:39.567
They have the caveman,
the lizard,

18:39.634 --> 18:41.367
and then the stack of money
with the eyeballs.

18:41.435 --> 18:43.202
And the fake Rod Serling guy.

18:43.270 --> 18:44.971
Oh, my God, right.
Thank you.

18:45.038 --> 18:47.140
I mean, you see how good
we are together?

18:47.207 --> 18:50.242
Look, Liz, I want this.

18:50.310 --> 18:51.910
But if we're gonna go for it,

18:51.978 --> 18:55.413
we gotta move forward a bit
with each visit.

18:55.481 --> 18:57.748
Two minutes to air.
Cast, please set yourselves.

18:57.816 --> 19:00.217
Look, you have to get back
to the airport, I have a show.

19:00.284 --> 19:02.852
How do we move this forward
in the time allotted?

19:02.920 --> 19:05.487
All right, let's each say
one thing about ourselves

19:05.555 --> 19:06.488
that the other person
doesn't know

19:06.556 --> 19:08.690
on the count of three,
all right?

19:08.758 --> 19:10.191
Ready? One, two, three.

19:10.259 --> 19:11.292
I'm on a waiting list
to adopt a kid.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.493
Touched by a priest...
it's fine.

19:12.561 --> 19:13.694
Wait, what?

19:13.762 --> 19:16.930
Okay...
That was a step.

19:16.997 --> 19:18.898
Yeah.

19:18.966 --> 19:20.667
See you October 14.

19:22.802 --> 19:27.369
Cast for "would you rather"
set yourselves, please.

19:27.437 --> 19:29.438
I never thought you'd
make it this far, Lemon.

19:29.505 --> 19:32.106
I know, season five... We were
supposed to get cancelled.

19:32.174 --> 19:34.308
Not just the show, I mean you.

19:34.375 --> 19:36.776
You're in an "adult dude"
situation.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.277
You're wearing
a beautiful blazer

19:38.345 --> 19:40.379
from Rico's husky-boy
collection...

19:40.446 --> 19:43.114
<i>Is that what
ragazzi robusti means?</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:44.849
I'm just saying
I'm happy for you.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.384
Thank you, Jack.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.121
And I'm glad that you're getting
to keep your wall "elk tongue."

19:49.188 --> 19:51.424
Actually, no.
The fabulous James and I

19:51.492 --> 19:52.558
came up with an excellent idea.

19:52.626 --> 19:53.860
We're taking that wall down.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.128
That way we can make the master
bedroom closet bigger

19:56.196 --> 19:58.365
and gain a nice
architectural symmetry.

19:58.432 --> 20:01.503
Huh. You think maybe that's
what Avery wanted all along?

20:03.472 --> 20:05.673
Oh, my God.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.175
Hannibal defeated Fabian
with a decoy army.

20:08.242 --> 20:09.476
James was a plant.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.777
The strie wall finish
was a decoy.

20:11.845 --> 20:13.345
She hannibaled my Fabian!

20:13.413 --> 20:16.849
Lemon, Avery and I are
perfect together.

20:16.917 --> 20:20.118
Like...Whiskey and hunting.

20:20.186 --> 20:24.722
"Soul mate" doesn't even begin
to do it justice.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.791
She's my...

20:26.858 --> 20:29.926
She's your pube shirt.

20:29.994 --> 20:31.494
Pube shirt.

20:34.149 --> 20:35.616
That's our show.
Good night.

20:36.084 --> 20:37.951
Good night, Miss Maroney.
Good night, Mr. Jordan.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.287
<i>Good night, TGS band,</i>

20:40.355 --> 20:42.089
with your funny-smelling
dressing room.

20:42.156 --> 20:44.124
Good night, bear!

20:44.192 --> 20:47.460
Good night moon...Soon park
from accounting.

20:47.528 --> 20:49.461
Good night, Miss Lemon.

20:49.529 --> 20:52.730
Good night, Mr. Donaghy.

20:52.798 --> 20:54.565
I lied to Mr. Jordan.

20:54.633 --> 20:58.369
I miss you all so much.

20:58.436 --> 21:00.670
Sir?
Is it really you?

21:00.737 --> 21:01.703
Sure is.

21:01.771 --> 21:03.506
Wanna go kiss in the prop cage?

21:03.574 --> 21:04.808
What? No!

21:04.875 --> 21:09.844
