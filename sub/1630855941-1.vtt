01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.897
You don't know how you'll react.

01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:53.358
It's uncontrolled.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:59.989
When someone asks how you'd react
if someone tried to mug you,

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.242
and you say, "I'd run after the thief."

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.287
But when an actual thief mugs you,

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.374
you don't know how you'll react.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.459
Emotions are different
from person to person.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.922
David was a complex player.

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:21.928
And back then, facing a player like him

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.097
was somehow motivating.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.732
He was so good-looking.

01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:37.652
And we weren't that good-looking.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:43.032
That created a rivalry
which is good for motivation.

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:14.791
Football is all about deceiving.

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.090
England were controlling the match.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:46.030
But it's not only about
controlling the ball.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:59.460
It's also about focus and passion,
and also controlling anger.

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:06.717
And here comes the play.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:12.348
I went to bother him
to see if he would react.

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:58.644
It was one second.
