00:06.256 --> 00:09.801
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.012 --> 00:12.887
<i>Yummy!</i>

00:12.971 --> 00:17.142
Today's lunch special
tastes fairly unique.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.936
That was so delicious.

00:20.603 --> 00:24.649
At first I thought they must've been
joking with the roasted pickles.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.151
Um, by the way...

00:26.943 --> 00:30.447
Nao, why are you staring at me?

00:30.780 --> 00:33.783
No reason.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.663
How about a nice after-lunch refreshment?

00:38.913 --> 00:41.916
Oh! The <i>Joie</i> Lady!
What great timing.

00:42.167 --> 00:46.171
Which <i>Joie</i> flavor should I choose today?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.548
You took the fermented milk one before.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.261
The only flavor approved as food for
specified health uses is plain.

00:56.639 --> 00:57.932
W-What the hell?

01:04.272 --> 01:06.983
-Oh, it's the "Kingdom" guy.
-Huh?

01:11.988 --> 01:13.406
W-What?

01:13.656 --> 01:15.867
A mass proposal?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.620
It is an honor to meet you.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.163
Sada Hinomoto.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.414
Huh?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.194
Let me introduce you

03:14.277 --> 03:17.447
the former Vice Minister from
the Imperial Household Agency

03:17.530 --> 03:19.699
and ceremony official, Mr. Iboshi.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.826
A very prestigious man!

03:21.951 --> 03:24.954
He's not the "Kingdom" guy.
He's an imperialist.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.748
What's is he doing Gifu?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.585
The moment we've been waiting,
has arrived.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.296
You, the White Lovers, will finally learn
your true mission...

03:33.379 --> 03:37.050
with the Organic Transformed Fliers.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.344
White Lovers?

03:40.762 --> 03:41.888
The true mission.

03:42.055 --> 03:47.852
Seventy-four years ago, the country put
all its effort into a great Ritual...

03:48.269 --> 03:49.854
the execution of The Rule.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.773
The Rule?

03:52.607 --> 03:58.738
Organic Transformed Fliers are terrifying
if misused and can cause great damage.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.616
And so there is one
to rule over them all...

04:01.866 --> 04:04.118
and that is Lord Mitatsu.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.789
Every 74 years, Lord Mitatsu awakens...

04:07.872 --> 04:09.916
to be transported to
its next place of rest,

04:10.416 --> 04:12.085
Fushido.

04:12.210 --> 04:16.130
Guiding Lord Mitatsu,
so that he does not get lost...

04:16.589 --> 04:23.221
is the true duty of the White Lovers
and the Organic Transformed Fliers.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.891
So? Do you understand?

04:27.225 --> 04:31.271
I didn't understand a thing.
It was so sudden, I'm totally lost.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.984
I wonder if this Lord Mitatsu
is bigger than Futomomo.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.528
To deal with unforeseen circumstances,

04:38.611 --> 04:43.491
we have a combined task force comprised of
all three Self-Defense Force branches.

04:43.908 --> 04:48.121
The deserted island training was part
of a larger military operation.

04:48.538 --> 04:54.127
That island itself was actually
the sleeping Lord Mitatsu.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.128
Huh?

04:55.586 --> 04:59.215
And the ones to rouse
Lord Mitatsu from his slumber

04:59.299 --> 05:01.718
were you, the White Lovers.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.802
What?

05:03.052 --> 05:07.932
With all self-defense forces mobilized,
your mission as Dragon Pilots...

05:08.016 --> 05:12.603
will be to guide the large-scale OTF
to its new throne.

05:13.271 --> 05:18.735
The Rule will tentatively be called,
The Gifu Mixed Formation Operation.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.237
But, the mixed formation
would be limited.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.657
So the heat dispersion flights
were nothing but masquerades?

05:24.866 --> 05:28.161
It is true that the OTF
still needs to release heat.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.580
They were not completely pointless.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.334
At least it was worth
getting all sweaty every day.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.339
This is not some pipe dream.
It is and unmistakably reality...

05:39.964 --> 05:43.343
and a proper mission for us to fulfill.

05:43.926 --> 05:45.303
Bear that in mind.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.770
Somehow, I still can't believe it.

05:54.103 --> 05:59.275
Although, I guess I'm not the one to talk,
especially while I'm inside Masotan.

05:59.567 --> 06:05.281
Still, we'll do an extra careful check,
since the real training starts tomorrow.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.783
Um...

06:07.533 --> 06:09.327
<i>Gear down.</i>

06:11.037 --> 06:13.623
<i>Okonogi, weren't you surprised , huh?</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:18.002
I was surprised. But there are
things that need to be done.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.463
<i>You're so positive.</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:21.506
<i>Ailerons.</i>

06:22.090 --> 06:23.800
Right. Left.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.970
<i>Air brake, open.</i>

06:28.763 --> 06:29.889
<i>Open.</i>

06:30.473 --> 06:31.391
<i>Close.</i>

06:32.016 --> 06:32.934
Next.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.852
<i>-Nozzle, right.</i>
-Nozzle, right.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.567
<i>We are tuned up!</i>

06:42.527 --> 06:43.694
Check completely.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.197
<i>Got it. I'll  check completely!</i>

06:47.532 --> 06:48.699
Oh, that's right!

06:48.950 --> 06:50.576
-<i>Okonogi!</i>
-Yes?

06:50.660 --> 06:51.577
Huh?

06:56.457 --> 06:57.291
Here I am!

06:58.793 --> 06:59.919
Did you get it?

07:00.002 --> 07:04.173
It's a sound from the zombie movie
to signal when I want out of Masotan!

07:06.384 --> 07:08.845
-Remember this?
-Oh, I get it.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.472
You know what?
We were watching a remake!

07:11.556 --> 07:14.475
The original is now on Blu-ray
or something!

07:14.851 --> 07:16.227
Is that so?

07:16.310 --> 07:20.731
I'll order it online so we can watch
how crappy it is over and over together!

07:21.983 --> 07:24.944
But I guess we can't watch it
by ourselves in the barracks.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.821
T-Those two...

07:27.280 --> 07:30.825
After one date,
how far are they taking it?

07:33.619 --> 07:35.371
This place is packed.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.040
But why is everyone gathered here?

07:39.584 --> 07:40.585
Our guest is here.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.574
The... <i>Joie</i> Lady?

08:12.366 --> 08:13.910
Not going to stand for me?

08:14.160 --> 08:15.536
Oh! A...

08:15.870 --> 08:17.288
Attention!

08:17.955 --> 08:18.789
Bow!

08:19.415 --> 08:20.791
Good morning!

08:21.834 --> 08:22.668
Huh?

08:23.085 --> 08:25.796
Yes, good morning.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.881
Be seated!

08:28.090 --> 08:29.550
The woman standing before you

08:29.634 --> 08:35.765
took to the skies during the Pacific War
with an OTF 74 years ago.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.683
A genuine White Lover.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.143
In other words...

08:39.435 --> 08:45.149
She is the last living Dragon Pilot
with experience of previous missions.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.651
What?

08:46.817 --> 08:52.406
Which means that she's Nao's mom and
Moriyama's senior's senior's senior!

08:52.657 --> 08:55.660
Well, we also learned
of this only yesterday.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.455
Ms. Hinomoto was chosen
to be a Dragon Pilot...

08:59.539 --> 09:02.166
and assigned to the army aviation unit
in complete secrecy.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.547
In Rabaul, Papua New Guinea,
she saved many of her comrades.

09:08.172 --> 09:12.927
And before we knew it, she was being
called the Heavenly Maiden of Rabaul.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.430
No wonder our bodies
moved so fast for her.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.933
Jeez! She made me nervous.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.688
About The Rule...

09:24.355 --> 09:27.942
safely delivering Lord Mitatsu
to his destination...

09:28.067 --> 09:30.027
will not be a walk in the park.

09:30.486 --> 09:34.365
I used to think, being an escort
would've been easy.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.659
I wonder if he's impatient.

09:36.867 --> 09:40.955
No, Lord Mitatsu moves
at a very slow pace.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.874
Slowly, slowly.

09:44.125 --> 09:48.921
It will take three days and three nights
at that pace to reach the destination.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.756
-Huh?
-No way...

09:51.173 --> 09:54.010
That's right. For three days and nights...

09:54.468 --> 09:57.430
you must fly the whole time.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.685
<i>Hiso Maso!</i>

10:02.810 --> 10:03.644
<i>Woo!</i>

10:09.317 --> 10:10.151
El!

10:11.193 --> 10:13.446
Uh, I meant Hoshino.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.989
Well...

10:16.073 --> 10:19.243
since we can't fly for three days
straight with you...

10:19.785 --> 10:22.747
we'll be following you in shifts
as much as we can.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.706
Thanks.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.792
All right. See you later.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.224
<i>I never would've guessed</i>
<i>the Joie Lady...</i>

10:42.308 --> 10:45.686
<i>is actually Ms. Sada, a Dragon Pilot</i>
<i>from way back.</i>

10:45.978 --> 10:48.105
I was just as surprised.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.858
It was a big surprise, but...

10:52.109 --> 10:54.278
The operation will take place
in three months' time.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.321
So soon!

10:55.738 --> 10:59.992
Until then, Ms. Hinomoto will be
guiding you with her experience.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.370
Excuse me!

11:02.745 --> 11:05.373
What if we fall asleep
in the middle of it?

11:05.581 --> 11:09.293
Lord Mitatsu will lose
sight of his path...

11:09.752 --> 11:13.339
and wreak havoc on wherever he ends up.

11:15.466 --> 11:19.804
Is it even possible for Norma and
others to fly for three days straight?p

11:20.221 --> 11:22.682
The OTF does not require replenishment.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.810
Everything depends on the Dragon Pilots.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.228
That's impossible...

11:27.311 --> 11:31.023
Did you really not sleep?

11:31.649 --> 11:35.236
Of course I couldn't stay awake.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.487
Then?

11:36.987 --> 11:40.074
You just have to fly in your dreams.

11:40.574 --> 11:42.326
In our dreams?

11:42.743 --> 11:46.455
As long as you don't lose your path...

11:46.664 --> 11:50.751
your OTF will always fly with you.

11:53.045 --> 11:57.091
<i>Why can humans stock up food</i>
<i>but not sleep?</i>

11:57.508 --> 12:00.219
Masotan can take over for short distances.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.346
Don't get so worked up about it.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.931
Wow.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.600
-Are they reading each other's minds?
-Wrong!

12:06.684 --> 12:08.728
I signaled for the left aileron!

12:08.811 --> 12:12.022
Gosh, I don't understand this crap at all!

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
-Or maybe not.
-Or maybe not.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.915
Don't knock out everyone.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.599
The Maritime Self-Defense
Force target tug...

12:46.724 --> 12:48.517
has arrived at 20,000 feet.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.895
It's being towed at 20 knots per hour.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.441
They've entered the golf course airspace.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.485
All aircraft commence operation.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.403
FIRST DAY... 6:00 A.M. J.S.T.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.539
<i>Awesome.</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:14.418
<i>If this were a fight, the enemy</i>
<i>wouldn't know what's coming from behind.</i>

13:14.877 --> 13:17.797
<i>Only VTOL move at that speed.</i>

13:23.260 --> 13:26.597
We're moving so slow,
I feel like I'm pedaling a bike.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.682
<i>"Do not fly off alone...</i>

13:29.183 --> 13:31.101
<i>fly with them."</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:33.729
<i>It's Ms. Hinomoto instructions.</i>

13:34.188 --> 13:35.105
<i>The Joie Lady?</i>

13:38.234 --> 13:41.111
<i>I meant to say, Ms. Sada!</i>

13:42.780 --> 13:43.697
Roger!

13:44.156 --> 13:47.493
Sustaining a hovering position
at low speed for three days...

13:47.952 --> 13:49.954
That could make a person faint.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.458
Lord Mitatsu's speed and traits
are equal to that of a typhoon.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.336
While proceeding at
18 to 24 miles per hour,

13:57.419 --> 14:00.256
it's like trying to stay
in the eye of the storm.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.550
Without the OTF,

14:02.633 --> 14:07.179
it would be impossible to follow
Lord Mitatsu so closely.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.350
FIRST DAY... 6:00 P.M. J.S.T.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.565
The pursuit planes are rotating, huh?

14:17.648 --> 14:20.067
SECOND DAY... 6:00 A.M. J.S.T.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.278
We've made it past the first hurdle.

14:22.778 --> 14:24.530
Just two more times.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.616
This is as hard as I thought.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.994
I'm so sleepy.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.956
If I wanted to, I could
fall asleep in a second.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.332
<i>Go ahead.</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:36.375
Huh?

14:36.625 --> 14:41.463
<i>"Convey to the OTF</i>
<i>to take over while you sleep."</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:43.674
<i>Ms. Hinomoto's instructions.</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:47.177
I know she says that, but...

14:47.595 --> 14:51.015
That's what it means to fly together.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.684
"That's what it means to fly together,"

14:54.143 --> 14:55.603
<i>says Ms. Hinomoto.</i>

14:57.521 --> 14:59.732
SECOND DAY... 11:00 P.M. J.S.T.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.108
Yo.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.110
How are they doing?

15:03.527 --> 15:05.487
It looks considerably difficult.

15:05.696 --> 15:08.198
But they are quite persistent.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.659
Anyway, I'll leave it to you.

15:11.035 --> 15:11.869
You got it.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.871
THIRD DAY... 3:00 A.M. J.S.T.

15:13.954 --> 15:14.830
Hey!

15:15.205 --> 15:17.082
This does not look good.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.588
<i>Hoshino! All of you!</i>

15:22.838 --> 15:25.257
<i>-Keep it together!</i>
-Damn it!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.760
I don't know...

15:28.177 --> 15:30.930
Am I awake? Am I asleep?

15:31.347 --> 15:33.515
I just don't know anymore.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.619
3:00 P.M. J.S.T.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.173
The wire is stretching.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.343
-Go to battle speed two!
-Battle speed two!

16:09.718 --> 16:11.720
Keep it at 150 degrees!

16:11.929 --> 16:14.098
Holding at 150 degrees!

16:14.765 --> 16:18.060
The destroyer is matching
our bearing and speed, but...

16:18.352 --> 16:21.981
Technical Sergeant Hitomi!
Wake up your OTF now!

16:22.564 --> 16:25.234
Flight Leader Kakiyasu.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.278
I have a favor to ask of you.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.949
9:00 P.M. J.S.T.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.242
Snooze...

16:37.121 --> 16:38.455
Wait for me...

16:39.081 --> 16:40.290
Masotan.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.585
I'll switch with you soon.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.716
Actually, just a little more...

16:49.717 --> 16:52.177
I need...

16:52.511 --> 16:54.346
to fly...

16:56.306 --> 16:59.727
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
<i>You bunch of wimps!</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:04.106
<i>You're all warm and comfy inside,</i>
<i>and you're not even injured!</i>

17:04.565 --> 17:06.817
<i>You can't even fly for three days?</i>

17:06.942 --> 17:08.485
Ms. Sada...

17:11.113 --> 17:13.115
<i>The fact that you can't sleep...</i>

17:13.449 --> 17:17.995
<i>is the same as not relying on</i>
<i>your Organic Transformed Fliers!</i>

17:18.287 --> 17:21.540
<i>Become one with them and fly!</i>

17:21.874 --> 17:25.252
Why can't you do this spectacular thing?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.755
Knock it off, you fools!!

17:28.172 --> 17:30.049
She just called us fools.

17:30.132 --> 17:34.053
<i>The Joie Lady is nowhere to be seen.</i>

17:34.386 --> 17:37.264
If you're not going
to trust your partner fully,

17:37.389 --> 17:39.850
then go fly home now!

17:39.975 --> 17:42.102
<i>I can't be so irresponsible!</i>

17:42.644 --> 17:44.354
<i>Technical Sergeant Amakasu?</i>

17:44.438 --> 17:46.523
<i>To put everything on Masotan...</i>

17:46.857 --> 17:48.859
<i>to make only Masotan fly...</i>

17:49.234 --> 17:51.528
<i>to just be sleeping like a baby...</i>

17:51.737 --> 17:53.572
<i>I can't be so unjust!</i>

17:53.947 --> 17:57.409
Don't you get it?
I told you to fly in your dreams!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.244
Yes! That's exactly it!

18:00.245 --> 18:01.622
<i>Ever since meeting Masotan...</i>

18:02.247 --> 18:05.959
I've been able to have the dream of
working hard as a Dragon Pilot.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.712
With Masotan...

18:09.088 --> 18:11.256
I've always been flying in a dream!

18:11.548 --> 18:13.550
<i>She's not talking about</i>
<i>that kind of dream.</i>

18:13.717 --> 18:17.304
<i>So I'm telling you, it's not that</i>
<i>I don't trust Masotan!</i>

18:17.763 --> 18:20.140
<i>I just don't want to be selfish!</i>

18:20.432 --> 18:21.642
Technical Sergeant Amakasu.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.560
That's why...

18:24.478 --> 18:26.063
That's why...

18:29.024 --> 18:31.944
<i>Listen well...</i>
<i>Technical Sergeant Amakasu.</i>

18:32.194 --> 18:35.197
I'm... still listening... to you.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.824
<i>Not to my voice.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:39.159
<i>To your Organic Transformed Flier's voice.</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:41.870
Masotan's?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.085
Ah, don't do that, Masotan.

18:48.335 --> 18:52.506
It's like your rhythmic tummy sounds
are welcoming me to sleep.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.342
<i>Yes, it's telling you to sleep.</i>

18:56.635 --> 19:02.266
<i>All of your thoughts are being</i>
<i>properly conveyed to your OTF.</i>

19:02.766 --> 19:07.646
<i>That's why you, too,</i>
<i>should accept their thoughts.</i>

19:07.771 --> 19:09.898
Accept... their thoughts...

19:10.023 --> 19:13.610
You want us to sleep...

19:13.861 --> 19:16.989
Masotan... are you sure it's okay?

19:19.741 --> 19:21.994
Thank you, Masotan.

19:22.161 --> 19:26.957
I have a good grip
over your thoughts now.

19:37.217 --> 19:39.553
The destroyer's speed has decreased.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.888
Those girls!

19:42.097 --> 19:45.475
Your scolding must have
revitalized them, Ms. Hinomoto.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.854
Nope. They're sound asleep.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.063
Huh?

19:50.397 --> 19:53.483
Now then, shall we head home?

20:07.789 --> 20:10.959
You can do it! Just a little more!

20:26.058 --> 20:26.934
Let's go.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.518
Montparnasse.

20:35.567 --> 20:36.485
Masotan?

20:38.946 --> 20:39.780
Huh?

20:40.072 --> 20:42.241
<i>Very well done.</i>

20:42.783 --> 20:43.825
Ms. Sada?

20:44.117 --> 20:46.495
<i>You made it through three days!</i>

20:46.870 --> 20:48.455
<i>You guys are amazing!</i>

20:50.332 --> 20:52.542
<i>Hoshino, too... job well done.</i>

20:54.044 --> 20:55.128
What was that?

20:55.462 --> 20:57.965
It was like the dream we saw before.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.968
But then, was it...

21:03.512 --> 21:05.931
It was you, wasn't it, Masotan?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.771
Welcome home, Amakasu.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.731
Oh, thanks.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.320
What're you doing, Amakasu?

21:20.570 --> 21:23.573
Amakasu! You can't sleep here!

21:25.909 --> 21:27.202
Amakasu!

21:52.602 --> 21:53.687
Civilians?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.149
Oh!

22:07.909 --> 22:09.161
Natsume.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.329
Natsume?

22:10.829 --> 22:13.332
Haru, who is this girl?

22:14.541 --> 22:15.625
Haru?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.878
Right on time.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.507
But the plan for these girls
is confidential.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.926
Who are these girls?

22:25.302 --> 22:28.430
These are the Miko
who will be essential for The Rule.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.265
Miko?

22:30.432 --> 22:33.435
The presence of these girls...

22:33.518 --> 22:37.522
is just as important as
the Dragon Pilots and OTF.

22:38.106 --> 22:40.108
And your presence as well.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.234
Huh?

22:41.943 --> 22:44.071
From the Department of Divinities,

22:44.154 --> 22:46.990
High Steward Haruto Okonogi.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.993
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.500 --> 24:21.877
<i>-I like you.</i>
<i>-No!</i>

24:21.960 --> 24:23.378
<i>Will you go out with me?</i>

24:23.962 --> 24:25.338
<i>I really like you.</i>

24:41.980 --> 24:44.983
