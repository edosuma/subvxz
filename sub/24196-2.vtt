WEBVTT

00:29.071 --> 00:32.360
She's fared well, considering
she's been eight months cold.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.690
She's banked with coal,

00:33.784 --> 00:36.618
the stokers are giving her
kisses with the oil can.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.114
I can build her up in a day,

00:38.205 --> 00:40.492
once we receive good news
from a lead party.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.619
My crown's on Le Vesconte.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.622
West is surely the first place
ice will open.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.453
You'll lose. Graham crosses to land

00:47.548 --> 00:49.039
and covers twice the distance.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.839
I'm with the Captain on that one, sir.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.337
Then you're both on.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.383
I had an aunt in Brighton.

00:56.473 --> 00:59.511
I used to go and see her on holidays,
from London Bridge Station.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.969
I have almost certainly been
pulled back and forth by that very engine.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.806
Look at her now.
From footnote to lead paragraph.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.812
I might poach that
for my journal this evening.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.689
It would be an honor, sir.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.443
And as we're in a wagering spirit,

01:14.533 --> 01:17.276
shall we put odds on Francis favoring us
with his presence this morning?

01:17.369 --> 01:19.611
I hope he does.
Perhaps it'll give him a lift,

01:19.705 --> 01:21.788
seeing the parties off.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.811
Here comes the lending library.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.263
Just in time.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.316
Will this be another Jonathan Swift,
or are you sending me back to Herodotus?

01:50.402 --> 01:52.769
Sadly, there is no more Herodotus.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.900
No, this is a comedy.

01:54.990 --> 01:58.108
I thought you could do with
a bit of a laugh on your 50 miles.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.455
<i>Scour the ice,</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:08.376
with providence as your sure-footed guide,

02:08.461 --> 02:13.082
and return safely with news
that our long winter sojourn

02:13.175 --> 02:15.792
will soon lie behind us.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.175
And we can finally raise our sails again

02:19.264 --> 02:20.630
and force this passage.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.807
Graham.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.223
I appreciate you taking the cylinders.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.429
It will be an honor, sir.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.855
To lay our first footprints
upon King William Land

02:29.941 --> 02:31.148
and deliver your words.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.351
Be sure to come back with a story.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.186
Joyfully, sir.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.397
I only wish I could join in the outing.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.821
- Francis!
- Sir.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.868
Is there anything you'd like to say?

02:47.376 --> 02:49.038
Travel well.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.880
Right. Good luck, men.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.628
Company, three cheers!

02:56.718 --> 02:57.834
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

02:58.512 --> 02:59.628
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.549
- Hip-hip!
- Hooray!

04:24.890 --> 04:27.348
Dr. MacDonald's been kind enough
to lend me his journals

04:27.434 --> 04:30.017
from his time on Cumberland Sound.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.891
It was they who brought back
the Esquimaux,

04:32.981 --> 04:34.472
back to Aberdeen.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.807
Imagine.

04:37.736 --> 04:41.525
I don't recall his name,
but he was of the Inuk tribe.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.322
Lt. Gore, do you recall
that Inuk man's name?

04:46.411 --> 04:47.868
I do not, Mr. Goodsir.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.449
It was long and... terribly Esquimaux.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.630
Please let me take my part, Lieutenant.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.299
You said to watch for three days
and I've done it.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.377
Now let me relieve
someone who's earned it.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.635
Whoa! Whoa.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.677
Hartnell, let him spell you.

05:22.197 --> 05:25.315
There's nothing more natural
than pulling weight, Dr. Goodsir.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.899
Watch Morfin here in front,

05:26.993 --> 05:29.360
and me with the corner of your eye.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.491
Match our strides. You'll take to it.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.992
I know you will.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.206
Heave!

05:43.844 --> 05:46.678
Oh.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.550
Sorry.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.411
Sir John. I would have come to you.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.744
No, not at all. The stroll did me good.

06:19.838 --> 06:20.954
Shall we sit?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.891
I've come to repair our bonds, Francis.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.513
I'd like us to be friends again.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.304
You never lost my friendship.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.889
Well, that may be true,

06:39.983 --> 06:42.976
but I've certainly lost your company.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.732
And I'm not the only one to notice

06:45.822 --> 06:49.566
you've succeeded in avoiding
<i>Erebus</i> most of the winter.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.742
I'm... I'm a Captain.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.906
I'm peevish off my own ship.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.408
I leave it and...

06:59.544 --> 07:01.911
hear disaster knocking at its door

07:02.005 --> 07:04.088
before I'm ten steps away.

07:04.174 --> 07:08.088
Would it help if I said that
I made a mistake?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.674
You misunderstand me, Sir John.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.850
I only meant to describe
why I brood, not that I judge.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.645
Yes, but summer is coming, Francis.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.144
I mean, surely you can slip
your brooding now.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.771
Summer is here in name only, Sir John.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.687
Temperatures barely come up to zero.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.322
The sundogs remain.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.909
- These are the signs here.
- Yes, signs of a cold May.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.830
Signs that nature does not give
a damn about our plans.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.033
Is Nature's Author nowhere in your tally?

07:43.755 --> 07:46.668
What a disappointment I must be to you.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.632
It's simply that we're two men
on two very different ships.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.635
And here I've come,
to make peace on yours.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.136
Will you not on mine?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.103
I will always come to you.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.398
I serve at your command.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.072
Very well.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.040
Oh, your seat of ease, Francis.
There's a draft.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.329
It's the shore. It must be.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.038
Look what it does to the ice.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.837
An unstoppable force
meets an immovable mass.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.507
It's beautiful.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.051
We continue on foot.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.210
You deserve a prize
for your orienteering, Mr. Des Voeux.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.296
I can see the cairn.
It can't be half a mile.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.776
Looks as if the Eskis have left it alone.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.064
Seventeen years.
Maybe it spooks them.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.115
It's hard to imagine
anyone coming here. Ever.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.740
This place make you uneasy, Doctor?

11:49.918 --> 11:53.036
You call me doctor,
but technically I'm just a surgeon.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.542
- Anatomist, in fact.
- That's a doctor in my book.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.545
Thank you.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.595
- Sir.
- Thank you.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.837
Right.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.731
I pray it's English tea merchants
coming from Canton

13:00.822 --> 13:03.189
who look upon that message next.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.691
See something, Goodsir?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.531
No, sir.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.489
Sgt. Bryant, accompany me
to the second cairn.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.542
We can walk the ice, scout for open water.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.665
Mr. Des Voeux,

13:17.755 --> 13:19.963
return with the boys
to the sledge and make camp.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.756
Get some rest if we've not returned.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.004
Godspeed, sir.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.803
Come on.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.232
Lt. Gore!

14:02.050 --> 14:04.007
- Is someone there?
- Shh.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.426
Answer me.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.098
Lt. Irving.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.268
Mr. Gibson.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.187
What are you doing down here?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.230
I'd come down for coal
earlier this morning

14:19.317 --> 14:22.060
and heard one of the ship's cats
crying back here somewhere.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.236
Is someone with you?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.322
Yes. Mr. Hickey was kind enough
to accompany me

14:27.408 --> 14:30.526
in trying to find it.
He's been looking all over behind here.

14:30.620 --> 14:32.236
- The captain.
- Got caught up...

14:32.330 --> 14:34.913
His seat of ease has a draft.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.581
Have Mr. Hickey see to it.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.375
I'm here, Lieutenant. Sir?

14:47.345 --> 14:50.383
- He's running to inform.
- No, I don't think he will.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.054
Cornelius, we'll be lashed.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.516
If Lt. Irving goes to inform command,

15:01.609 --> 15:04.147
then he's gonna have to tell them
what it is he saw.

15:05.363 --> 15:08.401
Which means he's gonna have to
open his imagination...

15:09.867 --> 15:11.779
to what he didn't.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.789
I've seen him at Sir John's
Sunday service.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.918
I've watched him pray.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.213
That's a man afraid of chaos.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.545
He's not going to invite more
if he can help it.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.126
We can't be sure of it.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.387
No.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.936
But there are worse things
than being lashed.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.489
Looking forward to getting a stove going?

16:00.918 --> 16:03.376
Wait on. Look.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.376
What could have done that?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.212
There must be a bear.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.298
A bear did that?

16:20.021 --> 16:22.104
We'll be able to tell by the tracks.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.482
There may be more than one.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.367
Shall we all go?

16:38.706 --> 16:42.575
I just don't understand
why he resists us, James.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.751
He's a disappointed man.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.583
You should not have to bear
his grievances.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.756
Perhaps it is I who's unable

16:49.842 --> 16:52.550
to truly bring him into
the bosom of my confidence.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.053
I want to. I always plan to.

16:55.139 --> 16:58.098
But then, when I'm with him,
I don't know why I falter.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.925
You have done everything for the man.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.056
- Have I?
- Sir,

17:02.146 --> 17:05.605
he was no-one's first choice
for this expedition.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.773
Nor was I.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.021
How any man achieves his post
on an expedition

17:12.114 --> 17:14.356
is less important than how he spends it.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.032
And...

17:18.162 --> 17:20.369
well, that he measures up.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.703
I will not have Francis's
melancholy touch you.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.209
I'll not have it. Do you hear me?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.882
Yes!

17:32.969 --> 17:34.801
Sorry to interrupt, sirs.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.378
What is it, Mr. Bridgens?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.885
The first lead party's just returned, sir.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.810
What news, Lieutenant? Stay seated.

17:49.151 --> 17:51.188
We traveled as far as 11 miles east, sir.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.272
We discerned no signs of the ice yielding.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.402
And the men, how did they fare?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.233
Some of them are with Dr. Stanley now.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.910
We also had an issue with our provisions.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.580
- What issue?
- Some were rotted.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.827
Inedibly so.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.502
Ask Mr. Wall to prepare

18:08.588 --> 18:11.331
an early supper
for the Lieutenant and his men.

18:12.383 --> 18:15.376
Gather your strength
before returning to your ship.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.929
I'm... sorry to disappoint you, sir.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.756
Oh, not at all.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.218
We suspected east
was not our brightest star to follow.

18:24.312 --> 18:27.976
Nevertheless, you and the men
have done a great service.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.726
Well done.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.662
Go on! Go on!

18:45.124 --> 18:46.581
Here!

18:47.460 --> 18:49.543
The western team must be nearly home now.

18:51.213 --> 18:54.297
Good thing. It looks like a sour sky.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.970
Funny to think of this place
as home, isn't it?

19:15.905 --> 19:17.817
Well, here she comes now.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.991
I thought Mohawks had carted you off.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.490
Oh, no, much worse.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.791
He proposed. Again.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.625
You declined, of course?

19:35.132 --> 19:38.091
Not firmly enough, in my opinion.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.010
In gratitude to you both for my care,

19:41.097 --> 19:43.384
must I surrender my privacy?

19:43.474 --> 19:46.558
Sophia, your safety in this world

19:46.644 --> 19:48.727
is what we would keep you
from surrendering.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.226
This matter with Francis won't end

19:51.315 --> 19:52.897
until you are firm, my dear.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.349
He's an explorer,

19:54.443 --> 19:57.561
and you must know by now
that explorers are made of hope.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.862
They breathe hope.

19:58.948 --> 20:02.362
I can't very well ask him
to stop breathing, Uncle.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.783
No.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.987
But you really must repel
his curiosities now.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.789
I know you won't find it as much fun
as encouraging them,

20:09.875 --> 20:11.867
but you're not a child.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.044
He's suitable for a good many women.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.371
Mm.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.671
I've no doubt.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.795
But... just...

20:19.885 --> 20:22.502
under a different banner than ours.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.409
You weren't sleeping either?

20:50.499 --> 20:53.412
If only sleep were as simple
as closing your eyes.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.953
I was thinking about Tad.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.759
The first of Parry's
boat-hauling reindeer.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.632
Tad!

21:06.015 --> 21:07.631
What made you think of that poor sod?

21:07.725 --> 21:08.932
We brought those deer

21:09.018 --> 21:11.761
a thousand miles north from Norway.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.188
Only to slaughter them on the ice.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.975
Maybe that was the ice that made me
want to be a master.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.696
The way it kept moving us back.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.696
Mm. It was rough ice.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.278
The deer couldn't haul on it.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.207
We knew that in a day.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.994
But we kept them anyway.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.416
Ferrying deer from ice floe to ice floe...

21:43.636 --> 21:47.300
by boat, thinking we could
use them by and by.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.097
Rowing reindeer in our sleigh boats!

21:51.852 --> 21:55.471
Like proper little ladies...

21:55.564 --> 21:56.975
...in ostrich carts.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.149
They were so confused.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.944
Is that us... now?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.197
Confused, out of our depth?

22:14.291 --> 22:16.704
We've seen worse than this, you and me.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.463
And I know you saw much worse south,
with Sir James.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.666
I've heard other versions than yours.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.751
I know them to be reliable.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.759
- This is different.
- Aye.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.175
You trusted Ross and you trusted Parry.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.929
Either you're a clairvoyant

22:38.023 --> 22:40.982
or I'm not doing half the job I think I am

22:41.068 --> 22:42.354
concealing my thoughts.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.898
No, it's just that I know you.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.194
What will it do to us, the ice?

22:52.288 --> 22:53.870
If no leads get found

22:53.956 --> 22:56.369
and we have to spend another winter here.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.001
Without a thaw to clear last winter's ice,

23:00.087 --> 23:03.205
it will start to back up
and then pile up high.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.840
Like one whole country

23:05.926 --> 23:08.384
being squeezed into
the borders of another.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.052
It'll push the boats up.

23:10.139 --> 23:13.473
Aye, I've seen boats forced
20, 30 feet in the jam.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.469
Can we survive that amount of pressure?

23:19.481 --> 23:22.224
If it drives us up, yeah, we'll ride it.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.727
It could also drive us under.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.315
Snap our beams and crush us at the waist.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.779
Let's pray for the former, then.

24:03.359 --> 24:04.770
I'll put the third tent up.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.194
We'll all appreciate the extra room

24:08.280 --> 24:10.146
if we're in for foul weather.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.127
I was only just thinking
that's what this camp needed:

24:28.217 --> 24:29.424
more ice.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.896
Time to get inside, boys!

24:46.986 --> 24:48.693
We're just ahead of it.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.696
Are you repairing the boat?

24:51.782 --> 24:54.490
Get inside! Now!

25:26.358 --> 25:28.850
The boat, sir. We found it like that.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.205
Blast it.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.379
That bear was tracking us.

25:50.299 --> 25:53.758
We heard it a mile back, up in the ice,
and a mile before that.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.710
I fired in its direction to drive it off,

25:55.804 --> 25:57.136
but it must not before in its life

25:57.222 --> 25:59.555
have smelled anything like an Englishman.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.928
What do we do?

26:02.019 --> 26:04.887
Shoot it in the head.
Carve it up for supper.

26:07.107 --> 26:09.474
And if it's not alone?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.242
Everyone, a rifle.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.419
It's just up there.

27:21.265 --> 27:24.474
Mr. Goodsir! Come quickly!

27:47.332 --> 27:49.039
He took it in the chest, sir.

28:04.308 --> 28:05.719
That's a girl.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.149
Who is she looking for?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.111
I'll get the lieutenant.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.094
I'll caulk you next.

29:12.209 --> 29:14.576
Neptune, sir. He relieved himself

29:14.670 --> 29:16.206
before I could alert Mr. Jopson.

29:16.296 --> 29:18.128
There was no warning, I'm afraid.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.832
- And yet you take up the duty.
- My apologies, sir.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.588
I know better to mind my own tasks.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.089
Not at all. I meant it

29:24.179 --> 29:26.341
as a statement of gratitude, Mr. Hickey.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.099
You're most welcome, Captain.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.931
- You're a Limerick man?
- Thereabouts, sir.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.775
But that's not
what comes out of your mouth.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.235
If I hadn't read the ship's roster,

29:45.325 --> 29:47.237
I'd never have known you were Irish.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.659
I've lived as many years

29:48.745 --> 29:51.112
in Liverpool and Manchester as there.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.619
I barely remember anything but England.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.458
It must have made it easier for you.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.245
Yeah.

29:59.339 --> 30:01.376
I learnt early:

30:01.466 --> 30:03.674
those who are quickest to tally your value

30:03.760 --> 30:05.843
often do it on your spots alone.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.052
You should know that Discovery Service

30:10.142 --> 30:13.601
is not unlike the world in that regard.

30:13.687 --> 30:15.644
If not worse.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.056
You've done extraordinarily well.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.525
Captain of a great ship.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.061
Gives the rest of us Micks hope.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.402
Would you take a drink, Mr. Hickey?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.201
I wouldn't put the Captain out.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.544
- What day of the week is it?
- It's a Wednesday, sir.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.882
Ourselves, then.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.055
It's fitting.

31:06.323 --> 31:09.031
The second lead party returned last night.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.037
No leads west.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.830
Forgive me for saying, sir,

31:16.917 --> 31:19.876
but I have my doubts
we'll see leads this year.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.756
Perhaps I would have done better

31:29.846 --> 31:31.633
to have played your game, Mr. Hickey,

31:31.723 --> 31:32.964
and culled the world.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.602
I applaud you.

31:40.482 --> 31:41.598
Come!

31:43.026 --> 31:44.233
Yes, John.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.894
I'm...

31:48.323 --> 31:51.691
I'm sorry, sir, the last lead party, sir,

31:51.785 --> 31:53.868
it's been sighted.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.720
Gangway! Officer coming through!

32:16.810 --> 32:19.302
Mind your backs. Mind your backs, boys.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.809
Officer coming through. Gangway.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.981
Mind your backs.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.493
Where's Graham?

32:45.005 --> 32:46.166
Dr. Stanley.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.464
Commander Fitzjames,
I will not touch this man.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.793
You needn't. This man's been
in my care for two days.

32:51.887 --> 32:52.968
Mr. Goodsir...

32:53.054 --> 32:55.467
The bullet needs to be removed
so the hole can be closed,

32:55.557 --> 32:57.549
otherwise it will keep
collapsing his lung,

32:57.642 --> 33:00.225
which I suspect is leaning
on the man's heart.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.350
What is Sir John's wish here?

33:05.025 --> 33:07.733
We may be able to spare him.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.232
May I have your leave to try?

33:11.114 --> 33:15.700
He had nothing to do with
what happened to Lt. Gore, sir.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.356
This man's her father.

33:47.442 --> 33:50.606
Sir, can you tell her
this will be painful for him

33:50.695 --> 33:52.812
but I'll be as quick as I can be?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.488
Shh.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.741
It's in too deep in the tissue.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.243
Can't you cut it out?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.322
Every breath he takes is making it worse.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.159
Who knows how badly we jostled
him getting him to the ship?

35:35.550 --> 35:36.631
What is she saying?

35:36.718 --> 35:39.802
She's begging him not to ask this of her.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.470
Ask what of her?

35:46.269 --> 35:47.259
No...!

35:58.615 --> 35:59.822
Stretcher! Bring a stretcher!

35:59.908 --> 36:02.992
- What's happening?
- She says he must die on the ice.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.739
Commander Fitzjames,

36:42.826 --> 36:45.318
you'll escort this woman off <i>Erebus.</i>

36:45.412 --> 36:48.746
Please see to it that the sick bay
is restored, Dr. Stanley.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.415
- Certainly, sir.
- Sir, with your permission,

36:51.501 --> 36:53.538
I'd like to take the woman aboard <i>Terror.</i>

36:53.628 --> 36:56.371
You're staying here, Francis,
until we've heard from

36:56.464 --> 37:00.299
every one of Graham's team
about what happened out there.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.219
Mr. Goodsir, come with us, please.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.136
We found only one set of prints.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.642
Large.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.940
20 inches across.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.939
How long did you search for Lt. Gore...

37:25.034 --> 37:26.616
before you decided to leave him?

37:26.703 --> 37:29.036
We searched for a half mile
in each direction, sir.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.785
Then how can you be certain
he was killed?

37:31.875 --> 37:34.663
The amount of blood, sir, on the ice.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.329
No man could have survived
losing so much.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.714
You say this with complete
authority on the subject?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.385
I do, sir.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.849
Whether it was our grief or fatigue,
I cannot say,

37:49.934 --> 37:53.644
but some of us... Hartnell
and Morfin specifically...

37:53.730 --> 37:56.973
became convinced that the bear
continued to track us

37:57.066 --> 38:00.150
here, back to the ships.

38:00.236 --> 38:04.446
Based on what evidence... Mr. Goodsir?

38:05.784 --> 38:08.948
We could not be more distressed
by what happened, sirs.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.074
Lt. Gore was one of the very best men...

38:11.164 --> 38:15.283
Leads, Doctor. Did you find any leads?

38:16.294 --> 38:19.628
The ice showed no sign of a thaw,
Captains.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.127
On the contrary, the wrack of ice

38:22.217 --> 38:24.300
built up around the shore
of King William Land

38:24.385 --> 38:26.547
was thicker than Lt. Gore expected.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.881
You're now an expert on the ice too,
Mr. Goodsir?

38:31.059 --> 38:33.301
Thank you. That will be all.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.724
There's one more thing, Captains.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.806
- Yes?
- The Esquimaux man.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.356
What about him?

38:39.442 --> 38:41.980
He had signs of a...

38:43.071 --> 38:45.028
surgical procedure in his past.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.151
What sort of procedure?

38:48.076 --> 38:50.033
He had no tongue.

38:50.119 --> 38:53.157
It was removed some time ago, I believe,

38:53.248 --> 38:55.331
with some sharp edge.

38:55.416 --> 38:58.705
These people are not our concern.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.837
We have one of our own men to mourn.

39:03.258 --> 39:06.296
- You may go.
- Sir.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.626
- What have you learned?
- She's in good condition.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.258
And she has been eating.
Fairly well, in fact.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.590
That could mean her people
have found game in the area.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.429
- Has she conversed with you?
- No.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.383
Hm?

41:30.780 --> 41:33.568
She said that if we don't leave now...

41:35.827 --> 41:38.240
we're going to <i>huk-kah-hoi.</i>

41:39.122 --> 41:40.954
- Disappear.
- Mm.
