00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(light music)

00:06.548 --> 00:10.802
Dad, only two more inches
to Wichita Falls.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.723
HANK: Two and a quarter, Bobby.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.807
Good eye, son.

00:16.224 --> 00:18.643
Hey, what's the best way to get
to Corpus Christi?

00:18.727 --> 00:21.271
Well, the quickest way
is straight down here.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.815
But the best way is to go through Arlen.

00:23.898 --> 00:27.485
It's one of George Bush's communities
of excellence.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.486
Arlen, huh?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.447
-Is that where you're headed?
-No, sir.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.741
We're on our way to Wichita Falls.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.953
We're gonna see the training camp
of the Dallas Cowboys.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.956
They used to be in Austin
till, well, you know...

00:40.040 --> 00:44.252
But like my dad says,
"Cowboys will be cowboys."

00:44.335 --> 00:45.587
(laughs)

00:45.670 --> 00:48.006
I say that in private, son.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.054
(fast-paced light music)

01:18.620 --> 01:20.622
ANNOUNCER: Welcome to Wichita Falls,

01:20.705 --> 01:24.918
training camp of the former
world champion Dallas Cowboys.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.921
Yeah, way to go, Cowboys!

01:28.004 --> 01:30.298
Irvin's looking good this year, huh, Dad?

01:30.381 --> 01:33.510
Yep. I'm giving him an A-minus.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.012
I'm giving him a B-plus.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.056
That gives him some room to improve.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.307
Good idea, son.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.102
And I'm giving Troy Aikman a B-plus, too.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.436
That's not funny, Bobby.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.521
(referee whistles)

01:49.067 --> 01:50.318
Dad, look.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.987
They forgot one of their footballs.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.489
(shushes)

01:54.572 --> 01:55.824
Follow me.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.204
(epic music)

02:05.708 --> 02:08.711
Sweet Jethro Pugh!

02:10.630 --> 02:12.674
The Super Bowl has come down to one play.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.301
Fourth down, Aikman drops back to pass.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.137
Irvin heads for the goal line.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.223
That's you, Bobby.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.058
Oh, okay.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.979
Troy's under pressure.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.981
He fires into the end zone.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.151
And hits Michael Irvin for a touchdown!

02:31.234 --> 02:33.027
Ooo. Dang!

02:33.111 --> 02:35.113
Uh, hold on a minute.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.698
Uh, pass interference.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.700
Cowboys retain possession.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
And they run out the clock.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.956
Uh, turns out they were ahead all along.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.792
The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!

02:47.876 --> 02:51.004
-The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!
-The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!

02:51.087 --> 02:54.924
-The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!
-The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!

02:55.008 --> 02:56.092
Yeah!

02:57.844 --> 02:59.429
-Well, hooray.
-(both gasp)

02:59.512 --> 03:00.889
Where are you guys from?

03:00.972 --> 03:02.015
Arlen, Texas.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.308
Pig town.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.309
You a pig farmer?

03:04.392 --> 03:07.020
Uh, I think you're confused, sir.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.773
We don't raise pigs in Arlen, Texas,
we process them.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.816
Oh, yeah.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.402
Yeah, you folks make them
tiny breakfast weenies.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.862
But you're gonna have to leave now.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.823
(somber music)

03:22.243 --> 03:24.829
Wow! Did you just see that, Dad?

03:24.913 --> 03:28.416
He added an extra move
when he gave me the Blizzard.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.710
An extra little twirl.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.462
BOBBY: They don't do that in Arlen.

03:33.004 --> 03:38.134
Wichita Falls is the greatest place
I have ever been in my life.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.260
A dollar nine.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.055
What? In Arlen they're 99 cents.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.642
In Arlen it's not the official
blended frozen dairy product

03:45.725 --> 03:48.144
of the Dallas Cowboys training camp.

After a hard day's work at a job you love,

04:39.279 --> 04:42.031
you get to take your son

04:42.115 --> 04:45.034
I am so sick of you
south Texas pig jockeys

04:45.118 --> 04:50.039
coming in here waking me up
to tell me, "How about them Cowboys?"

04:50.123 --> 04:52.583
Arlen stinks and Wichita Falls rules.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.668

They don't have beds like this in Arlen.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.843
They certainly do not.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.929
Look what I found in the night stand.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.514
HANK: What the heck is this?

05:48.598 --> 05:53.269
This is the tape that Wichita Falls
made to show how great it is here,

05:53.353 --> 05:57.857

and that's why they came.

I like it more than "pig town".

06:26.803 --> 06:31.182

out right now with two or three

06:31.265 --> 06:33.017

06:35.770 --> 06:36.896
Geez!

06:36.979 --> 06:40.108

this town is before.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.244
I think I'm gonna throw up. Ugh.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.497
It's just a sausage plant.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.791

07:21.357 --> 07:23.651

Yeah, too good.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.611
Now he's down on his home town.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.781
All his dreams from now on
are gonna be about leaving,

07:28.865 --> 07:31.242
and then some high school
guidance counselor

07:31.325 --> 07:33.411
is gonna tell him to follow his dreams.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.121
Then how will he end up?

07:35.204 --> 07:37.623
A fruit-pie salesman
with a Whoopee Cushion

07:37.707 --> 07:40.168
living in Wichita Falls.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.795
Hank, it's happening
to the best of our young people.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.589
There is nothing here for them.

07:44.672 --> 07:49.385
Last week sixth graders told me
they wanted to be astronauts.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.305
You can't find work as an astronaut
in Arlen, Hank.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.764
Mm-mm, not anymore.

07:53.848 --> 07:54.765
(sighs deeply)

07:54.849 --> 07:58.519
I've been trying to hire some teenagers
at Strickland for months.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.522
No one wants to be a tank wipe these days.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.691
(light switch clicks)

08:04.942 --> 08:07.945
HANK: And the problem
is our kids are leaving.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.323
Hank is right.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.408
If all the children leave Arlen,

08:12.492 --> 08:15.411
there will be no young
to take care of our old.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.498
Our old will feed off our very old.

08:18.581 --> 08:22.460
Our very old who are not eaten
will wish they had been...

08:23.669 --> 08:24.629
eaten.

08:24.712 --> 08:27.798
Uh, Dale, that's not gonna happen.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.884
Not if we do something about it.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.136
We are going to keep our young people

08:32.220 --> 08:35.181
by bringing the Dallas Cowboys
training camp to Arlen.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.641
-Ooh.
-(gasps)

08:36.724 --> 08:38.476
I know it's a long shot,

08:38.559 --> 08:41.896
but what if we make a movie
about Arlen and send it to the Cowboys?

08:41.979 --> 08:43.940
Do you really think we can make
a movie, Hank?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.483
I know we can.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.236
We used to make movies all the time.
Remember, Dale?

08:48.319 --> 08:50.655
You practically slept
with that little camcorder.

08:50.738 --> 08:51.614
Practically.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.575
I was going to be the next Zapruder.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.453
Except nobody shot a president after that.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.330
Nobody knew what he was doing.

08:59.413 --> 09:03.334
Shugs, as a professional
on-air personality,

09:03.417 --> 09:05.836
I would be glad to donate my services.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.340
I've always wanted to branch out
from weather to hard infotainment.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.218
Uh-huh, and every good movie
starts with...

09:12.301 --> 09:13.219
With what?

09:13.302 --> 09:14.387
A good script.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.972
Yeah, pass the salt, please.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.182
Hey, Peggy, you're a writer.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.600
You could write the script.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.061
Me? Well, all right.

09:22.144 --> 09:24.522
I will do it for the children of Arlen.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.108
And I will be the president of the movie.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.067
Tell you what, man.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.444
All you need is get one of them
dang ol' narrators, man,

09:30.528 --> 09:32.113
just like the movie trailer guys.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.657
You know, "in a world where love
is against the law,"

09:34.740 --> 09:36.242
-you know, something like that.
-Yeah!

09:36.325 --> 09:38.744
Or, uh, we could put you
in an armadillo suit.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.039
Bill, you'll be in charge of snacks.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.584
(gasps)
Oh, well, this calls for sopapillas.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.253
All right! Yeah! How about them Cowboys?

09:47.336 --> 09:49.380
-DALE: Cowboys.
-HANK: Sopapillas for everyone!

09:49.463 --> 09:53.926
In Wichita Falls,
this button doesn't stick.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.724
Welcome, Jerry Jones.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.434
I'm Nancy Hicks-Gribble,

10:01.517 --> 10:05.605
and I'll be your tour guide
on a magical journey through Arlen, Texas,

10:05.688 --> 10:08.524
the next training-camp site
of the Dallas Cowboys.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.028
Sharks may be scary,
as is the spear like marlin,

10:12.111 --> 10:15.823
but fear not, Jerry,
for landlocked Arlen is darlin'.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.118
-HANK: Cut!
-We're gonna get the cowboys!

10:19.201 --> 10:21.537
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Dale.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.041
Now, I noticed you were jiggling
the camera a bit.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.710
We really don't need
any fancy camera tricks.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.128
Just point 'n' shoot.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.254
Got ya.

10:30.338 --> 10:34.550
Consider me a human tripod
with an invisible third leg.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.888
Like you Cowboys,
Arlenites are rugged individualists.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.390
We are do-it-yourselfers,
for your information.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.559
That's D-I-Y-F-Y-I.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.520
One more reason Arlen is darlin'.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
Cut!

10:47.688 --> 10:53.319
Okay. That was written okay
and acted pretty good, but it needs, uh...

10:54.528 --> 10:57.239
It needs, hm, let me think about this...

10:57.323 --> 10:59.241
Uh, huh.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.081
All right, let's do it again,
maybe a little better this time.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.917
I don't care what Hank says, Shug.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.543
I think your script is just wonderful.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.629
Well, thank you, Nancy.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.340
I got that rhyming idea
from Charles Kuralt.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.176
Or was it Charles Osgood?

11:17.259 --> 11:18.302
Wait.

11:18.386 --> 11:21.305
Which one was the one
with the mistress and the Winnebago?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.766
Oh, they all fool around, Shug.
(chuckles)

11:23.849 --> 11:25.226
Anyway, your script is brilliant.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.310
I wouldn't change a word.

11:26.394 --> 11:30.981
Well, now that you mention it,
you did change one teeny little word.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.108
Really?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.651
-Did I?
-Yes.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.738
You said "Arlenites"
instead of "Arlenians".

11:37.822 --> 11:41.909
Oh. That's the Channel 84
preferred term for "residents of Arlen".

11:41.992 --> 11:45.538
Well, technically,
residents of Arlen are called "Arlenians".

11:45.621 --> 11:48.249
As a substitute educator,
I would know that.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.668
(laughs)

11:50.751 --> 11:53.045
Well, you're the writer, Shug.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.382
I'm just the professional
television personality.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.218
<i>Like you Cowboys, Arlenites...</i>

11:59.301 --> 12:02.054
-I'm duct-taping your zoom.
-Oh.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.597
BOOMHAUER: Man, ol' heat rash, man.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.727
Uh, dang ol' hot... not happy...
you know what I mean?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.980
Boomhauer, we'll get to you tomorrow,
I promise.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.983
BOOMHAUER: Yeah, man. Talk about
your dang ol' hurry up and wait, man.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.069
Thanks, man.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.823
Gosh! I don't know
who's sweating more, me or the cheese.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.325
BOBBY: You look tired, Dad.

12:23.409 --> 12:27.705
I guess it's hard to get enough rest
when you're "presidenting" a film.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.417
Yep. See, I'm gonna do
a big shot from up here.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.088
Do you really think the Cowboys
would move to Arlen?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.757
I sure do, son.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.341
Imagine what it'll be like.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.051
We'll go to get autographs,

12:41.135 --> 12:44.388
and Troy Aikman will toss
the ball around with you,

12:44.889 --> 12:49.268
and I wish I could have had
Dandy Don Meredith or Roger Staubach

12:49.351 --> 12:51.437
throwing me passes when I was your age.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.356
Even Craig Morton
would have been all right.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.193
I love you, Bobby.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.194
What?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.695
Uh, nothing.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.447
Hey, look at that bird.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.365
(birds cawing)

13:03.449 --> 13:07.703
Dale, stop putting your bug truck
in the background of all the shots.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.580
What kind of message are we sending?

13:09.663 --> 13:11.165
Arlen is full of bugs?

13:11.248 --> 13:13.000
You think that's all I do?

13:13.083 --> 13:15.503
I killed eight gophers last year.

13:15.586 --> 13:19.340
And a purebred Tennessee walking horse
that was looking at me funny.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.593
Did you know that that prima donna
had the gall

13:22.676 --> 13:24.720
to suggest changing my slogan from

13:24.804 --> 13:29.767
"Arlen is darlin'"
to "Arlen where Super Bowls are born."

13:30.476 --> 13:34.021
"Where Super Bowls are born." Huh.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.773
Where is Nancy anyway?

13:35.856 --> 13:38.651
Well, Miss Priss is pouting
in her trailer.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.694
She won't do my snake scene.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.449
-(upbeat music playing over car radio)
-(car approaching)

13:46.784 --> 13:49.495
Huh. Thank god you're here, John Redcorn!

13:49.578 --> 13:51.831
Nancy won't come out of the bug-abago.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.839
Nancy has a headache
and requires treatment.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.298
I will need about an hour.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.843
And a bottle of Asti Spumanti.

14:05.094 --> 14:05.928
I'll get it.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.138
(light music)

14:12.560 --> 14:15.271
That's it. You have pampered
that woman long enough.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.022
Put me on camera right this second.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.233
Come on. Come on.
The snakes and I are ready to go.

14:19.316 --> 14:23.320
Uh, maybe we should give
John Redcorn a few more minutes.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.156
(imitates water flushing)

14:26.240 --> 14:27.408
Do you know what that is?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.410
-No.
-Let me tell you.

14:29.493 --> 14:34.039
That is the sound of Arlen's future
going right down the toilet.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.458
And do you know whose butt
is on that seat?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.002
Well, it's yours, Hank.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.712
It's your butt.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.840
Dale, get the camera.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.050
-(monkey gibberish)
-HANK: Okay, we're rolling.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.802
Now, just try to relax.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
And remember, all the Cowboys
will be watching you.

14:50.848 --> 14:55.185
It's feeding time here
at the world-famous Arlen Snake Farm.

14:55.853 --> 15:00.274
You Cowboys have a lot in common
with these hungry vipers.

15:00.941 --> 15:06.405
They devour rodents just the way
you devour... opponents.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.409
(mice squeaking)

15:11.035 --> 15:11.994
HANK: Time out.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.874
-Uh, that was, uh, uh...
-(gasps, whimpers)

15:16.957 --> 15:20.210
Oh, look, here's Nancy now. Heh.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.547
Uh, Nancy, Peggy was just, uh,
standing in for you.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.342
Now, honey, if you'll just, uh,
step aside.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.678
Nancy, why don't we do this one
with your new slogan,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.972
"Arlen where Super Bowls are born".

15:34.516 --> 15:38.562
Oh, I'll say my slogan, Shug,
but I'm not touching that little mouse.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.230
(chuckles)
Yes, you are.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.857
Oh!
(gasps)

15:42.483 --> 15:45.235
(screaming)

15:47.821 --> 15:50.199
BOOMHAUER:
Hey, hey, hey, man! Get him off!

15:50.699 --> 15:53.661
Get him off...
(mumbling)

15:53.744 --> 15:54.954
(Hank whimpers)

15:55.037 --> 15:56.372
(screaming)

15:58.374 --> 16:00.876
(Dale screams)

16:03.420 --> 16:04.713
Get off my cheese!

16:04.797 --> 16:05.631
(grunting)

16:06.090 --> 16:07.132
Cut!

16:07.216 --> 16:08.550
Bobby, help me save the cheese!

16:08.634 --> 16:10.219
-Cut!
-(chomping)

16:10.302 --> 16:11.553
(screaming)

16:12.429 --> 16:13.472
Cut it out!

16:13.555 --> 16:15.516
(screaming shakily)

16:15.599 --> 16:17.226
-(monkeys screeching)
-(screams)

16:19.728 --> 16:22.189
-(screams continues)
-(screeching)

16:22.564 --> 16:23.941
NANCY: I quit!

16:24.400 --> 16:28.153
Peggy, if you've ever loved
the Cowboys, apologize to her.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.405
She said "Arlenite".

16:29.488 --> 16:31.740
It's "Arlenian, Arlenian, Arlenian".

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
Either I get an apology or guess what?

16:33.909 --> 16:34.868
I quit.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.037
Well, you just quit, Shug.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.330
(sobbing)

16:38.497 --> 16:39.832
Then I quit!

16:39.915 --> 16:42.042
If Peggy quits, I quit.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.129
Oh, man! Ol' dang, man! I quit.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.297
Hank, you have bullyragged this production

16:47.381 --> 16:50.676
and stifled my creativity from day one.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.053
It is now day two.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.304
I quit!

16:55.097 --> 16:57.182
What about the Cowboys?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.934
The Cowboys!

16:59.018 --> 17:00.602
It's okay, Dad.

17:00.936 --> 17:04.815
We were crazy to try and compete
with Wichita Falls.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.863
Do this on my own.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.205
Hello, Jerry Jones.

17:20.289 --> 17:25.002
I'm Hank Hill and I'll be your quarterback
on a game winning drive

17:25.085 --> 17:26.545
through Arlen, Texas,

17:26.962 --> 17:30.132
the next training-camp site
of the Dallas Cowboys.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.683
(crow cawing in distance)

17:46.815 --> 17:51.653
I'm standing here at the 50-yard line
of Tut Rampy Field,

17:52.154 --> 17:56.408
the future site of the Dallas Cowboys
training camp.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.245
You see?
You're just a dot at this distance.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.664
Yeah, so edit it bigger.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.749
That's why I'm here.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.419
Hank, I'm the best UHF editor in Texas.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.296
But I can't work miracles.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.923
You've got no master shot,

18:11.006 --> 18:14.259
you've crossed the action axis,
the sound's horrible.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.138
I guess that was all
my responsibility as president.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.598
(sighs deeply)

18:20.933 --> 18:25.270
All I wanted to do was get my son
to love this town as much as I do.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.982
HANK: Where did I go wrong, Tom?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.192
Where?

18:30.859 --> 18:34.655
Dad's talking
to the Tom Landry plate again.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.323
Hello, Nancy?

18:36.406 --> 18:39.118
It's Peggy, and I would like
to apologize to you,

18:39.201 --> 18:41.120
one Arlenite to another.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.373
No, I was the one who said Arlenian.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.250
That's why this is an apology.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.212
All right. Let... let's just agree
to disagree.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.590
Now, I'm gonna need
to borrow your home movies.

18:54.842 --> 18:58.178
Dave, I hear you're the best
television editor in all of Texas.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.471
UHF.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.975
PEGGY: The reason I've called you all here
is to show you a video

19:03.058 --> 19:06.145
which we will be sending
to the Dallas Cowboys tomorrow morning.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.773
It was made over the years
by each and every one of us.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.650
(statics)

19:11.733 --> 19:14.361
(light music)

19:14.444 --> 19:17.531
BILL: And that's,
that's after having two chickens!

19:17.614 --> 19:19.700
Boy, was I drunk!

19:23.620 --> 19:25.789
BOBBY: Look how smooth my bottom was!

19:25.873 --> 19:26.790
HANK: Bobby!

19:31.211 --> 19:32.796
Oh.
(Bobby chuckles)

19:32.880 --> 19:35.674
(all laugh)

19:37.885 --> 19:39.011
DALE: Aw.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.563
HANK: You know, I made that barbecue
out of two old barbecues.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.565
(laughs)
Ah.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.576
(Dale and Bobby laugh)

20:12.002 --> 20:13.045
(applause)

20:13.128 --> 20:14.838
(sing-song)
We're gonna get the cowboys.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.882
DALE: We're gonna get the cowboys.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.676
(dramatic music)

20:20.719 --> 20:21.929
BOBBY: Hey, Dad.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.305
Hello, Bobby.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.266
Well, the Cowboys thanked us
for the video,

20:26.350 --> 20:30.145
but they have no plans to move
to Arlen in the near future.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.023
And they sent us a little rubber football.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.735
So, uh, I guess this means
you're gonna leave us

20:36.818 --> 20:38.070
when you grow up, huh?

20:38.153 --> 20:42.407
Yeah, I'll probably leave,
but it's not for a while, Dad.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.867
I'm only 12.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.203
We've still got plenty of time together.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.412
Yeah.

20:47.496 --> 20:51.458
And even after you move,
Wichita Falls is only a six-hour drive.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.170
But I can't be a prop comic
in Wichita Falls.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.715
I'm moving to New York City or Hollywood!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.092
Maybe Vegas.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.218
(sighs)

21:01.301 --> 21:04.096
Well, at least it's not Wichita Falls.

21:04.179 --> 21:08.684
Well, I may keep a place there
for tax purposes.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.061
Hey, you wanna try the little football?

21:11.144 --> 21:12.187
All right.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.189
Hike it to me and go out for a pass.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.693
How about you hike the ball
and go out for the pass?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.280
The crowd is going wild.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.199
(imitating cheering)

21:24.283 --> 21:27.369
Roger Staubach goes back to pass.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.745
BOBBY: Roger's in trouble.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.289
He scrambles.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.499
Roger the Dodger gets away.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.335
He throws into the end zone.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.463
It’s complete to my dad, Hank Hill!

21:38.547 --> 21:40.048
Touchdown!

21:40.132 --> 21:42.509
BOBBY: The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!

21:42.592 --> 21:44.845
The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!

21:44.928 --> 21:48.682
The Cowboys win the Super Bowl!
