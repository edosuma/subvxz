My Daywalkers, the trusted few?
They just like to party.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.353
It's quite an operation.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.924
Tell me, what about the victims?

01:55.082 --> 01:57.289
Seems like a lot of graves to dig.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.657
Can't kill 'em all.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.425
Too many folks go missing,

this godforsaken city,
then, well done.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.550
I'm here and I'm worried.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.888
Now, pick up,
before I kick in your bloody door.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.225
Who the hell are you?

03:09.756 --> 03:11.429
Ah, you must be the maid.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.332
My bags are in the car.
Get them, will you?

03:13.493 --> 03:15.530
Hello.
Not the maid.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.576
Right. You're that werewolf girl
my brother, Klaus, knocked up.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.241
I was expecting to see some kind
of supernatural, miracle baby-bump.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.610
Guess you're not showing, yet.
It's Hayley, isn't it?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.684
You have your brother's manners.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.219
And his temper, too.
So, watch it.

03:30.944 --> 03:31.945
Where's Elijah?

03:32.112 --> 03:33.284
Beats me.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.958
He's long gone.

03:35.115 --> 03:36.458
What do you mean, "long gone?"

03:36.616 --> 03:40.291
Well, one minute, he was here, making
epic promises about protecting me,

03:40.454 --> 03:42.627
in this predicament
that a bottle of scotch

03:42.789 --> 03:44.928
and some bad decisions got me into.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.935
He was all poetic
about how we're family.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.472
And then, Klaus told me he bailed.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.941
Guess that's what I get,
for trusting a vampire.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.412
Elijah is not just any vampire
and he doesn't break promises.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.609
Which means Niklaus has done
something dastardly and Klaus-like.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.482
Klaus! Get out here and tell me
what you've done with our brother,

04:03.643 --> 04:05.816
you narcissistic,
backstabbing wanker!

04:05.979 --> 04:08.482
Enough with all the shouting.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.559
Little sister, I should have known.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.721
I assume the six dead
vampires were your doing.

04:13.887 --> 04:14.957
They were very rude.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.964
Trying to victimize a poor,
innocent girl,

04:18.125 --> 04:19.899
just trying to find
her way to the Quarter.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.833
So sorry, were they friends of yours?

04:25.565 --> 04:27.272
That's right,
you don't have any friends.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.176
I do have friends.
I have Marcel.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.112
You remember him, don't you?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.774
Yes, of course you do.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.749
He fancies himself
the king of the Quarter,

04:35.909 --> 04:37.855
and he has these
rules about killing vampires.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.753
It'll be fun to see what sort of
punishment he comes up with for you.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.985
I don't care about Marcel
or his rules.

04:43.683 --> 04:47.529
Elijah doesn't welsh on deals.
What did you do to him?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.525
Perhaps he's on holiday.

04:52.659 --> 04:55.003
Or taking along,
autumn nap, upstairs.

04:55.695 --> 04:57.538
Well, go on.
Take a look around.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.340
You remember this house as well as I.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.182
I remember everything.

of a governor hid away</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:16.360
<i>all of our vampire sins,

<i>I remember finding
a moment of affection</i>

05:33.800 --> 05:35.643
<i>with the governor's son, Emil.</i>

even Elijah was happy.</i>

05:48.415 --> 05:50.861
Niklaus, there is no
hope for you, is there?

05:52.986 --> 05:55.159
- Are we interrupting?
- Yes.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.323
No.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.902
Dearest Elijah, you've only
ever wished happiness for me.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.403
Emil and I are in love.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.597
Please, let me turn him.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.776
(LAUGHS)

06:06.066 --> 06:08.342
Rebekah, the governor
has graciously agreed

06:08.501 --> 06:12.415
to hide a lot of our indiscretions.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.848
It would not do to turn
his only son into one of us.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.885
Please.
For me.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.387
It's not gonna happen, sister.

06:19.546 --> 06:22.117
If we turned every man you
dropped your knickers for,

06:22.282 --> 06:25.752
then, human beings would cease to
exist and we'd have no bloody food.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.626
How dare you, sir?

06:27.787 --> 06:30.791
- You would do well to--
- Niklaus. Brother.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.932

06:34.527 --> 06:36.370
- Wait!
- No!

06:46.139 --> 06:47.641
Well, he wasn't good enough for you.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.788
No one was ever good enough for me,
Nik, you made sure of that.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.446
Now, where is Elijah?

06:52.612 --> 06:54.250
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

06:55.916 --> 06:56.917
Where are you going?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.620
It appears the night
is not quite over, yet.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.663
I'm off for another drink
with Marcel.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.994
Elijah told me your plan to take
apart Marcel's empire,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.227
Piece by piece.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.498
I don't remember it involving you two
drinking New Orleans dry, together.

07:08.662 --> 07:11.006
I know you don't have
many friends, Rebekah.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.974
But what some friends do, when they
get together, is they drink.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.307
And when they drink,
they tell secrets.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.279
Marcel has, somehow, found a way
to control the entirety of witches

07:19.439 --> 07:21.180
in the Quarter and I aim
to uncover the how,

07:21.341 --> 07:22.979
so I might take it for myself.

07:24.511 --> 07:27.014
Finding Elijah didn't
make my to-do list, today.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.659
Oh, and welcome home, little sister.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.032
You. Wolf-girl.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.470
I'm gonna search this house,
inch-by-inch,

07:42.629 --> 07:45.200
until I find what my evil brother
has done to my good one.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.007
You're helping.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.650
The governor had
lots of secret rooms.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.309
I'll show you his favorite.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.197
You think Klaus killed him.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.896
We can't be killed, silly girl.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.799
That doesn't stop Klaus from
finding ways to torture us.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.531
He has a set of mystical,
silver daggers.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.006
One in the heart sends us
into a deep slumber.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.304
Klaus gets his jollies
from keeping us in a box,

08:21.468 --> 08:24.005
until he decides to
pull the dagger out.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.172
That must be what
he's done to Elijah.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.320
This one's mine.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.047
He keeps your coffin on standby.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.522
He likes to be prepared
for when his family members,

08:34.681 --> 08:36.490
inevitably, disappoint him.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.220
Elijah's isn't here.
He must have stashed him elsewhere.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.426
I feel sick.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.999
Welcome to the family, love.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.693
You should have run, the second
you realized Elijah was gone.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.931
Yeah, well, the witches have
put some sort of hex on me.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.598
As long as I'm carrying this baby,
I cant leave New Orleans.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.073
If I do, they kill me.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.042
Knowing Klaus,
he's planning a box for you,

08:55.201 --> 08:57.704
the second you give birth to
whatever's cooking in your tum.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.280
I'm leaving,
as soon as I find Elijah.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.445
Being daggered in a
box for decades sucks.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.523
Trust me.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.689
You best find a way
to break that hex and run.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.141
(DOOR SLAMS)

09:33.940 --> 09:35.385
Hello?

09:36.709 --> 09:38.313
Seriously, Marcel?

09:38.478 --> 09:39.821
Trying to scare me?

09:39.979 --> 09:42.926
I had nothing to do with
the attack on your guys last night!

(POTS CLATTERING)

10:00.567 --> 10:01.637
Sophie Deveraux.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.008
My brother, Elijah,
told me about you.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.672
Know who I am?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.841
Yeah, I know.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.953
Then, you know I need to talk.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.681
So, if I had to guess,
knowing Klaus' history,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.156
Elijah has a dagger in his chest.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.693
It's a magical object.
You're a witch.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.491
Do a locator spell,
locate the dagger, locate Elijah.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.026
I can't use magic.
It's punishable by death.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.466
- Marcel's rules.
- Marcel?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.196
What do you think
I'm going to do to you,

10:28.361 --> 10:29.704
if you don't give me what I want?

10:29.863 --> 10:31.103
Not much.

10:32.031 --> 10:33.374
I've been linked.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.979
So, anything you do to me,
you do to Hayley.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.444
Who?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.845
Oh, right, the mumsy.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.213
Well, luckily for you,
Elijah seems to care about her.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.218
Otherwise, I'd break your neck,
right here.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.720
How did Marcel get
so bloody powerful, anyway?

10:49.883 --> 10:52.022
He wasn't like this when I left
a hundred years ago.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.195
Marcel has a way to tell whenever
there's magic done in the Quarter.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.356
The how isn't relevant.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.230
I'll tell you
what's not bloody relevant.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.371
A coven of witches
who can't do magic.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.404
Here's an idea, move away.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.701
We practice ancestral magic.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.243
This cemetery is filled with
the remains of our witch ancestors.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.314
Without access to them,
we're powerless.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.418
If we run,
we're leaving our legacy behind.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.053
Our home, our family.

11:18.578 --> 11:20.251
Well, family's overrated.

11:25.385 --> 11:30.767
Look at me, I'm back in a city
that's given me nothing but heartache,

11:30.924 --> 11:33.768
looking for a brother
who's hell-bent on protecting a baby

11:33.927 --> 11:34.928
I don't care about.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.539
I find that hard to believe.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.907
- You're here, aren't you?
- I'm here for Elijah.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.410
The instant I find him, I'm gone.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.049
He was the one who
idiotically believed this baby

11:45.205 --> 11:47.378
would be Niklaus' redemption.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.453
And now, he's missing,
probably at the hands of Klaus himself.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.555
You were foolish enough to believe
that Elijah could convince Klaus

11:55.715 --> 11:58.525
to go against Marcel, when everyone
knows that they have a history.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.063
- Klaus sired Marcel, I'm aware.
- You don't understand.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.430

26:25.818 --> 26:26.796
(CHOKING)

26:26.985 --> 26:28.055
Nik!

26:28.987 --> 26:30.227
Nik!

26:31.123 --> 26:34.502
Keep your hands off her,
she is pregnant for God's sake!

26:34.760 --> 26:35.932
(GASPING)

26:36.061 --> 26:38.302
All of this bluster
about not wanting the child,

26:38.464 --> 26:41.570
and then the second she tells
you she's ready to get rid of it...?

26:46.939 --> 26:49.283
It's okay to care.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.186
It's okay to want something.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.590
That's all Elijah was trying to do,
all he's ever wanted for you.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.356
All we've ever wanted.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.383
I gave Elijah to Marcel.

27:25.544 --> 27:26.955
What?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.554
Marcel was nervous.

27:32.050 --> 27:35.054
Bad enough one Original
return to town, but two?

27:36.889 --> 27:38.698
His crew was getting antsy.

27:39.725 --> 27:46.006
He wanted Elijah gone,
so I gave him a peace offering.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.906
You bartered our brother.

27:48.066 --> 27:50.046
I have a plan.

27:51.136 --> 27:55.846
Gain Marcel's trust,
dismantle his empire,

27:56.008 --> 28:00.388
honor Elijah's wish
that that baby be born.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.554
I am executing that plan
the only way I know how.

28:05.984 --> 28:10.330
If you don't like it,
there's the door.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.328
See if I care.

28:24.002 --> 28:26.209
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

28:38.951 --> 28:43.400
I know you don't know me very well,
but thanks.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.798
I appreciate what you did in there.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.900
Us girls have got to
look out for each other.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.641
What is it with you two?

28:52.798 --> 28:57.713
You say you hate him, but the way
you deal with him it's so clear.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.548
Even when you hate him,
you still love him.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.380
I guess when you spend
a thousand years with someone,

29:04.576 --> 29:07.614
deciding to quit them is
like losing a part of yourself.

29:10.315 --> 29:14.821
But sometimes the hate
is just so powerful.

29:16.555 --> 29:20.093
Emil wasn't the only boyfriend
of mine that Klaus killed.

29:20.259 --> 29:24.298
He did it again and again, every
time I found someone to care about.

29:25.097 --> 29:29.239
He just kept doing it until,
finally, I stopped falling in love.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.343
He said he was protecting me
from my mistakes,

29:34.506 --> 29:38.181
that no one was ever good enough
for his little sister.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.515
Until one day, someone was.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.694
How was the river?

29:46.852 --> 29:49.924
It was cool, sweet.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.302
I should go talk--

29:57.596 --> 29:59.200
(GASPING)

30:03.001 --> 30:05.641
- My brother will kill you.
- Then I'll die smiling.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.311
Did I not warn you?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.013
Klaus, I beg of you!
He's not like any other.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.523
You saw it in him
from the very first day.

30:16.682 --> 30:19.822
You saved him.
Protected him.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.157
You raised him.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.226
You cannot kill him.

30:36.335 --> 30:37.678
(SWORD CLATTERS)

30:38.737 --> 30:41.980
You are right, I cannot.

30:46.411 --> 30:49.483
But you, dear sister,

30:49.648 --> 30:54.154
need a lesson in what you can
and cannot take from me.

31:01.159 --> 31:06.108
If you know Marcel has Elijah, why
don't you just get him back yourself?

31:06.264 --> 31:08.938
Because if I cross my brother,
there's still a coffin downstairs

31:09.101 --> 31:10.444
with my name on it.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.889
Oh, my God.

31:28.053 --> 31:30.033
I found them under your coffin.

31:31.423 --> 31:35.200
So, if a couple of antique steak
knives were the only thing stopping

31:35.360 --> 31:38.569
you from getting Elijah back,
then, here you go.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.950
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

31:54.946 --> 31:56.983
I sent everyone home for the night.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.925
I am your humble host.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.965
Well, okay.
Extra points for flare.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.726
And the night's just started.

32:07.092 --> 32:08.503
What made you decide to come?

32:10.729 --> 32:12.504
Everyone deserves a chance.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.909
You lied to me.
Where's my brother?

32:17.068 --> 32:20.106
Hello to you too.
Cami, Rebekah. Rebekah, Cami.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.278
I see you still have
a thing for blondes.

32:23.442 --> 32:24.512
Hey!

32:25.110 --> 32:26.612
Tell me where Elijah is.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.848
What the hell is going on?

32:28.013 --> 32:30.425
Tell me where he is
or I will kill you!

32:35.954 --> 32:38.127
No, you won't.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.006
Perhaps you're right.

32:47.933 --> 32:49.139
(GASPING)

32:49.301 --> 32:50.712
But I will kill her.

32:51.536 --> 32:54.210
Let her go.
You won.

32:54.372 --> 32:55.817
I'll take you to see Elijah.

(CHOKING, GASPING)

32:58.043 --> 32:59.716
What the hell are you people?

32:59.878 --> 33:03.451
Sh... It's okay.
Go home.

33:03.715 --> 33:08.130
Forget all this and just know that
I will make it up to you. I promise.

33:11.356 --> 33:14.803
You want to see Elijah?
Fine, follow me.

33:29.908 --> 33:30.909
Invite me in.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.647
Gotta ask the lady
of the house, Davina.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.491
Come on out, sweetheart.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.158
Invite her in.

33:42.087 --> 33:43.589
Come in.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.670
I wouldn't do that.

33:54.332 --> 33:56.107
Who the hell are you?

33:56.268 --> 33:57.440
Davina.

33:58.403 --> 33:59.780
She's an old one, isn't she?

33:59.938 --> 34:02.282
Yeah.
Rebekah is an Original.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.046
Which means she can't be killed.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.780
She doesn't seem very nice.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.791
She can be.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.949
But she hasn't been
very nice to me tonight.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.060
Then I'm afraid
it's time for you to leave.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.760
(SCREAMING)

34:32.603 --> 34:34.049
Well, it's about time.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.208
I was bored waiting.

34:38.143 --> 34:42.751
But I did so want to see your face
and it is, indeed, priceless.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.554
You bastard.
What day is it?

34:46.451 --> 34:47.452
Sunday.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.326
I have been daggered
for a whole week?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.659
Marcel, what have you done to him?

34:51.889 --> 34:54.837
It's 1887, Rebekah.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.132
You've been daggered
for 52 years.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.408
What?

34:59.431 --> 35:02.640
And don't worry about Marcel,
I presented him with a choice.

35:02.801 --> 35:06.146
He could choose to undagger you and
live out the rest of his human days

35:06.304 --> 35:07.840
-with you or...
- No.

35:08.006 --> 35:10.486
...I could turn him,
instead, as he's always wanted,

35:10.642 --> 35:12.622
in exchange for giving you up.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.117
No.
He wouldn't do that to me.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.351
Oh, but he did.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.160
(DOOR OPENS)

35:28.526 --> 35:30.005
MARCEL: Welcome back, Rebekah.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.703
You were out for quite a while.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.044
Where am I?

35:36.201 --> 35:37.646
How'd I get here?

35:37.802 --> 35:39.543
You upset Davina.

35:39.704 --> 35:42.184
I'm glad you two finally got to meet.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.183
Now, you know what
you're dealin' with.

35:45.477 --> 35:46.785
Is this my old room?

35:46.945 --> 35:48.219
It's mine, now.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.884
Just like this town is mine,
Davina's mine and Elijah's mine,

35:52.050 --> 35:53.859
until I feel like giving him back.

35:54.019 --> 35:57.899
What was once yours, what was
once your brother's, it's now mine.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.870
And don't ever touch Cami again.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.503
I didn't use it.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.744
You're awake.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.017
I could barely sleep all night.

36:49.174 --> 36:52.087
This house is like
a freaking swamp sauna.

36:56.081 --> 36:57.458
What stopped you?

36:59.284 --> 37:01.525
You could've been
free of all of this.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.699
Of me.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.461
Yeah, well, when I was
fighting off those vampires,

37:08.626 --> 37:11.869
I realized I wasn't
just protecting myself.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.375
Maybe it has to do with the fact
that my birth-parents gave me up

37:19.537 --> 37:21.881
and my adopted parents
kicked me out.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.413
All I know is, push came to shove

37:26.578 --> 37:30.720
and I realized
I wouldn't let anyone hurt it.

37:31.983 --> 37:37.092
I'm beginning to think
we're a lot alike, you and I.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.328
We're both cast-offs
who've learned to fight

37:40.492 --> 37:42.768
when we're backed into a corner.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.636
Well, we're backed
into a corner now.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.310
That we are.

37:50.568 --> 37:52.445
It's time to fight...

37:54.506 --> 37:55.780
...little wolf.

38:00.345 --> 38:04.191
This whole thing with Marcel,
the deal you have with the witches,

38:04.349 --> 38:06.852
trying to take him down,
take what's his...

38:07.085 --> 38:10.362
Rebekah told me that you two
once loved each other like family.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.159
What happened?

38:18.496 --> 38:20.533
I made Marcel everything that he is.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.138
I treated him like a son.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.047
And when my father chased me
and my family from New Orleans,

38:30.208 --> 38:33.212
a hundred years ago,
we believed Marcel was killed.

38:33.378 --> 38:37.849
We each mourned him in our own way.

38:38.016 --> 38:42.123
Yet, when I returned,
I found not only had he survived,

38:42.287 --> 38:43.732
he had thrived.

38:45.657 --> 38:51.164
Instead of seeking us out,
instead of sticking together as one,

38:51.329 --> 38:56.745
he made a choice to take
everything my family had built

38:56.901 --> 38:58.574
and make it his own.

38:59.170 --> 39:03.141
Now, he is living in our home,
he is sleeping in our beds.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.413
That "M" he stamps everywhere...

39:09.581 --> 39:11.254
It's not for 'Marcel'.

39:12.717 --> 39:14.253
It's for 'Mikaelson.'

39:17.755 --> 39:19.325
I want it all back.

39:19.824 --> 39:23.271
And if I have to
push him out to get it,

39:23.428 --> 39:25.408
then that's exactly what I'll do.

39:29.934 --> 39:31.936
I'll have someone see
to the air conditioning.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.346
You were right.

39:41.512 --> 39:43.617
The girl, Cami, she's the key.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.783
Marcel likes her and because of that,

39:45.950 --> 39:48.897
I got to see this secret weapon of his
that you've been going on about.

39:48.953 --> 39:51.433
Well, don't stand on ceremony.
What is it?

39:51.589 --> 39:55.628
It's not a "what", it's a "who."
A girl, Davina.

39:55.793 --> 39:59.605
She can't be more than sixteen
and I've never felt power like that.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.399
A witch.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.308
She's not just any witch.
She's something I've never seen before.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.142
Something beyond powerful.

40:06.304 --> 40:08.375
And now, because of you,
she has Elijah.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.477
Who knows what she could do to him?

40:12.043 --> 40:13.147
Where is she?

40:17.548 --> 40:18.822
That clever bitch.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.125
I don't know.

40:23.288 --> 40:24.494
What's wrong?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.733
She wiped my memory of the location.

40:29.560 --> 40:33.007
Marcel possesses a weapon bigger
and more powerful than an Original

40:33.164 --> 40:35.075
and you handed our brother to him!

40:35.233 --> 40:37.509
How many times will
Elijah forgive you?

40:37.669 --> 40:40.411
How long until his hope for
your redemption finally dies?

40:40.571 --> 40:42.414
I did what I had to do!

40:42.573 --> 40:43.745
Marcel took our home!

40:43.908 --> 40:47.014
And our home is worthless
without family.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.184
I am finding Elijah.

40:54.519 --> 40:55.589
Whatever it takes.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.599
Are you going to help me?

41:00.992 --> 41:02.494
Whatever it takes.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.720
I'm sorry about that unpleasantness.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.214
She doesn't scare me.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.517
None of them do.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.125
I didn't think they would, honey.

41:24.282 --> 41:26.956
But the thing is,
it seems like they're here to stay.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.725
They don't belong here.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.663
It might be kinda tough
to convince them of that.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.498
Which is why I need to
ask you for a favor.

41:40.198 --> 41:44.475
I'm gonna need you to figure
out how we kill an Original.
