01:05.065 --> 01:06.600
Dad's coming. Dad's coming.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.137
Don't giggle. You'll give it away.

01:10.337 --> 01:13.073
He's not to know Mom commissioned
a painting of herself for $2500.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.243
Really. Don't.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.849
Okay, okay.
Did you leave the price tag on?

01:22.049 --> 01:25.652
No, really, really, don't.
This could kill him, you know.

01:27.487 --> 01:30.123
Wait. Bud, don't we have
a loyalty to the man?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.992
That's a good one.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.794
I think he's coming. Okay.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.929
- Keep a straight face.
- Okay.

01:36.897 --> 01:37.898
Hi, kids.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.269
What?

01:42.536 --> 01:43.704
What?

01:45.973 --> 01:48.809
Nothing.
I guess we just love you so much.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.278
I've had a rotten day
and I'm in a foul mood.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.347
A fat woman came in
and said she was a size five.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.749
I shoved her hoof into a shoe...

01:56.650 --> 01:59.286
...my thumb got stuck
in the back of the shoe.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.290
She panicked, reared up,
and galloped around the store...

02:03.724 --> 02:05.759
...dragging me on the floor
behind her.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.828
Thank God a stick of butter
popped out her purse...

02:08.027 --> 02:09.429
...and I greased my way out of there.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.600
You know, we can't do this to the man.
We have to warn him.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.369
- Daddy?
- What?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.970
Nothing.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.740
Oh, by the way,
is your mom upstairs?

02:19.907 --> 02:21.074
- No, Dad.
- Good.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.343
Thank goodness
I don't have to look at her tonight.

02:26.513 --> 02:30.784
Feet. Women. Women's feet. Women.
Painting?

02:44.665 --> 02:45.799
I don't understand.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.235
Now, surely you'd think
he'd be screaming by now.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.070
Well, maybe we don't give Dad
enough credit.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.207
I mean, maybe he realizes
that he's been neglecting Mom lately...

02:53.407 --> 02:56.243
...and he's probably pondering that now
as he gazes fondly upon the face...

02:56.443 --> 02:57.744
...of his one true love.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.379
Oh, no!

03:07.654 --> 03:09.389
Or maybe not.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.493
How do you feel, Daddy?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.898
Like any man who just fell two stories
and landed on his head.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.933
Grateful not to be with your mother.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.070
- How long was I out?
- Two hours.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.404
Well, why didn't you call 911?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.440
I couldn't remember the number.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.776
Well, it doesn't matter.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.912
Do you know what happened
when I was unconscious?

03:32.346 --> 03:35.048
Oh, yeah. Kelly opened a Coors bottle
with your teeth.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.751
Don't listen to him, Dad.
It was only a soda.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.520
You had some too.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.855
- Shut up. Right in front of Dad.
- You started it.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.625
Oh, please.
It doesn't matter what you did.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.228
It only matters that I actually saw...

03:48.428 --> 03:49.730
...God.

03:50.831 --> 03:51.932
Okay.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.168
Kel, he may not be able
to sell shoes anymore...

03:54.368 --> 03:56.503
...but we can get him a gig
going cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.473
But I really did see him.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.475
Dad, please don't tell
anybody else about this...

04:01.675 --> 04:03.310
...because nobody is dumb enough
to believe...

04:03.510 --> 04:05.212
What did God look like, Dad?

04:06.547 --> 04:09.516
I don't know.
I couldn't take my eyes off his shoes.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.053
- You saw God's shoes?
- They were perfect, kids.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.389
Close-fitting,
surrounding each toe individually.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.091
- Probably a soft-worked kid leather.
- Well, what did you say to God?

04:18.325 --> 04:21.060
I said,
"Where'd you get those shoes?"

04:23.363 --> 04:25.299
You had one chance to talk
to the eternal creator...

04:25.499 --> 04:27.167
...of time, space
and the infinite universe...

04:27.367 --> 04:29.236
...and all you asked
is where he got his shoes?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.838
Did you tell him
your football stories?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.841
It was God, you idiot.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.844
He knows my football stories.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.279
Actually, I asked him
something very important.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.782
I said, what socks did he wear?
And you know what he said?

04:42.349 --> 04:45.285
"Don't need them. They're sewed in."

04:53.160 --> 04:55.729
Must I be the meat
in an imbecile sandwich?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.502
Bud, this is important.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.204
Now, Daddy, the next time
that you talk to God...

05:04.404 --> 05:07.207
...ask him
who's really buying Dockers.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.411
Come on. God can't be concerned
with these trivialities.

05:11.612 --> 05:12.980
We're talking shoes here.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.949
Now, kids, I now know
what my mission in life is.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.986
God chose me
to make the perfect shoes.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.187
God's shoes.

05:20.387 --> 05:21.755
Kids, bring me pen and paper
at once.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.393
Thank you.
Take this down quickly.

05:27.294 --> 05:30.964
Thou shalt have shoes
with toes stitched in.

05:31.165 --> 05:34.568
Thou shalt have socks
attacheth to yon shoes.

05:34.768 --> 05:38.972
And thou shalt have a lot of other stuff
that will come forthwith.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.642
It is I, I, Al Bundy...

05:41.842 --> 05:43.510
...who shall shod
the unwashed masses.

05:43.710 --> 05:48.282
I shalt not rest until every foot
sings the praises of thine shoes.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.451
Hallelujah, I say. Hallelujah!

06:00.294 --> 06:02.963
I don't think
I've ever been prouder of him.

06:04.298 --> 06:07.668
Well, God created both of you.
Think of the pride he's feeling.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.137
So let us understand.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.874
Your father has locked himself
in his room to build God's shoes.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.144
And Peggy?

06:17.444 --> 06:19.780
Sensing Dad's delicate condition,
she took back the painting...

06:19.980 --> 06:21.682
...kept the money
and went to the Mardi Gras.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.119
He's really been up there
40 days and 40 nights?

06:26.620 --> 06:28.555
Well, actually,
40 days and 39 nights.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.258
He took a break to watch
Planet of the D Cups.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.562
He said God told him to.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.833
- Think he'll be all right, Mrs. D'Arcy?
- How much worse can he be?

06:50.310 --> 06:54.147
Behold, I hold God's shoes.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.984
But who holds Dad's brain?

06:57.618 --> 07:00.621
Yea, so it cameth to be
that I laboured 40 days and 40 nights.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.624
Let the rains come.
Thou shalt have shoe.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.560
This should do wonders
for my property value.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.329
Are thine worthy
to gaze upon yon shoe?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.131
Brush your teeth.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.834
Nobody cares about your stupid shoes
and nobody believes...

07:14.067 --> 07:16.803
Let me gaze upon the shoes, Al.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.741
Surely you cannot be serious!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.776
Marcie, don't you understand?

07:22.976 --> 07:26.146
Don't you see the glory
and the majesty of what I just saw?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.048
The perfect marketing hook.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.717
And I'm in on the ground floor.
I can see the billboards now.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.754
"Al knows God,
and God knows shoes."

07:33.954 --> 07:35.656
It's a sales bonanza, Marcie.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.057
How much money do we have?

07:37.257 --> 07:39.426
Well, I have
several thousand dollars.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.929
You have change for coffee.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.932
I shall go forth unto the people
to reveal God's shoes...

07:45.132 --> 07:48.135
...and multiply upon them.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.940
Let me come with you, Al, and learn.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.310
- How much we gonna charge per pair?
- I will hear nothing of price.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.645
That's your job.
You're the marketing guy.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.089
Hey, babe, this is Grand Master B.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.860
I was wondering if you'd join me
in the back seat of a moving vehicle...

08:13.060 --> 08:15.963
...for a ride so wild
you gots to be 21.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.536
Yes, that was my father
walking the freeway in his robe.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.806
Goodbye.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.643
Boy, you know, they talk about
an illiterate society.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.212
Well, it seems to me
that everyone reads the newspaper.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.548
Well, I don't
and I still believe in Dad.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.884
Well, not quite as much as I did
with his failure...

08:37.083 --> 08:39.419
...to walk across Lake Michigan
to spread the shoe to Canada...

08:39.620 --> 08:41.554
...but he is going into production
on these shoes.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.323
Five thousand pairs.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.658
Wonder where he got the money.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.895
Did I leave my new Rolex over here?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.697
God, I am just
so scatterbrained lately.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.266
I mean, first I misplace my watch.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.901
And then I can't seem to remember...

08:54.101 --> 08:56.303
...this $25,000 check
made out to cash...

08:56.503 --> 08:59.039
...that I seemed to have written
in someone else's handwriting.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.943
By the way, has anyone seen
my soon-to-be-late husband?

09:04.611 --> 09:06.947
Well, who wants to touch
the prototypes?

09:07.147 --> 09:09.750
We got thousands of these babies
rolling off the assembly line now.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.718
Jefferson...

09:11.919 --> 09:13.987
...before I tell the baby
why its father is buried...

09:14.188 --> 09:16.323
...in four or five separate graves...

09:16.924 --> 09:19.493
...can you tell me
where every cent I have is?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.562
Advertising, baby.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.797
We contacted all the big talk shows
about having Al on.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.232
He should be on any minute.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.368
Just what big-time talk show
did you book him onto?

09:37.311 --> 09:42.749
Welcome back to Scary Mary's
Real Scary Mummy Movie Matinee.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.153
Now, before we get back
to our feature called...

09:46.353 --> 09:48.489
...What's That in the Bathroom?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.691
...we have a special treat
for you kids.

09:50.891 --> 09:55.195
Our special guest is Al Bundy,
shoe salesman.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.602
I've seen this show. It's excellent.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.072
This is what you booked him on?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.642
Well, every time I called Oprah
it seemed to be lunchtime.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.278
We're on our way, baby.
We're on our way.

10:11.478 --> 10:15.649
Kids, Al here says that he was scared
out of his bedroom window...

10:15.849 --> 10:18.318
...by a picture of his wife.

10:19.553 --> 10:23.690
Al says he saw God
after he hit the pavement.

10:28.595 --> 10:29.763
Then what happened, Al?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.665
Well, Scary Mary...

10:31.865 --> 10:33.400
...I saw God's shoes.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.337
Tell us all about it, Al.

10:37.538 --> 10:38.872
Well, Mary, believe it or not...

10:39.072 --> 10:41.208
...people mock me
for me having seen God's shoes.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.978
They throw things, shoot pellets at me,
sic dogs at me.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.815
And I know some of you kids out there
are the ones responsible for it.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.884
I'll get you, I swear.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.954
But I just persevere
with my message.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.724
Well, there you have it,
boys and girls.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.393
Al Bundy.

10:59.593 --> 11:03.230
You might want to check
under your beds for him tonight.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.200
And now, back to our movie.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.569
Wait. I was told I could
sell my shoes on this show.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.004
- Your producers promised me.
- Look, what do you want from me?

11:11.205 --> 11:12.606
I'm just a hand in a crummy sock.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.943
You'll be a sock full of bloody knuckles
if I don't get to peddle my shoes here!

11:16.143 --> 11:17.411
I'm on a holy mission.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.146
Stagehand! Stagehands over here.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.381
Well, they're God's shoes
and they're real comfortable.

11:21.582 --> 11:23.283
See, the socks are already built in.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.420
- Kids, if you're by the phone...
- See, I wear them myself. See?

11:26.620 --> 11:29.756
- 911. Can we get that on the screen?
- I'll kill you, Mary! I'll kill you!

11:32.025 --> 11:34.628
Sell it, baby, sell it.
Next stop, Ted Koppel.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.363
I bet Koppel gives him
the whole half-hour.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.432
Well, maybe 15 minutes.

11:38.632 --> 11:41.568
The rest will be taken up by the
"headless man found in lake" story.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.137
- When did that happen?
- Soon, honey.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.574
Point your staff at them, Dad.
Turn them all into snakes.

11:47.975 --> 11:48.976
That's not a staff, Kel.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.478
It's a branch one of
the neighbourhood kids threw at him.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.679
Well, what's the difference?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.749
He's still got the shoe pointed
at a camera. Way to go, buddy.

11:55.949 --> 11:56.950
Idiot.

11:57.151 --> 11:59.720
You sunk all of my money
into this man's vision?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.189
Hey, trust me just a little, babe.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.158
This is to loosen him up
in front of the camera.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.960
I'm gonna plaster his face
all over the tube.

12:10.531 --> 12:12.366
Welcome to People to Laugh At.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.201
I'm Dr. Jonathan Blue.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.504
Today's panel is made up of people
who have had head injuries...

12:17.704 --> 12:19.573
...and claim to have seen God.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.807
Let's start with Bob here.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.509
Well, I was eating
in this restaurant...

12:22.709 --> 12:24.378
...and a waitress hits my head
with a tray...

12:24.578 --> 12:26.780
...and I saw God
in my hot and sour soup.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.916
He told me,
"Don't order the meat loaf."

12:30.784 --> 12:32.853
Good, Bob. Lola?

12:33.620 --> 12:36.757
I fell off this table I was dancing on
and there he was.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.759
I gave him change for a 5.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.327
Thank you, Lola.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.763
And now, not just a man
who saw God...

12:42.963 --> 12:45.032
...but a man who's actually
gone into business with him:

12:45.232 --> 12:46.233
Al Bundy.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.335
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:48.535 --> 12:50.170
...I will demonstrate the power
of the shoes.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.574
I shall release them so you may
see them hover and fly about me.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.478
That's great, Al.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.814
Let's get to some callers,
shall we?

13:01.348 --> 13:03.383
Our first caller is Jerry,
a trucker from Iowa.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.752
What would you like to ask
of those who've been touched?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.921
I'd lik e to see the girlie dance.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.559
We'll just go to our next caller.

13:12.759 --> 13:13.760
Derrick from Peoria.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.330
Derrick, do you have a question
about an out-of-body experience?

13:16.530 --> 13:18.565
Yeah, I got this '85 Bonneville...

13:18.765 --> 13:20.567
...and the side mouldings
just won't stay on...

13:20.767 --> 13:24.838
Derrick, that's out-of-body experience,
not auto-body experience.

13:26.707 --> 13:28.342
Well, can I see the girlie dance?

13:35.249 --> 13:37.050
Doc, I think we've got another caller.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.853
Okay, okay. Go ahead, caller.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.889
Yeah, this is for the insane guy
with the shoes.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.557
Yes?

13:43.757 --> 13:46.727
My name is Bu... Bub.
Yeah, Bub.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.930
Listen, did you ever once think what
your insanity is doing to your family?

13:50.364 --> 13:51.698
Especially your son.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.400
Put on your pants,
for heaven's sak e.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.002
Go to work, you bum.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.204
Bud? Bud, is that you?

13:57.404 --> 13:59.840
I'm warning you, Dad.
I will not live lik e this.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.975
Don't you understand it's hard enough
to get a date...

14:02.176 --> 14:04.811
These people are morons.
Let's go to the next caller.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.916
No more calls?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.919
Okay, baby, dance.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.070
All in all, not bad.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.840
Come on, babe.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.409
I still think this God angle's
gonna bring in the suckers.

14:35.609 --> 14:36.610
Oh, please.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.680
The only thing biblical about this
is the proportion of its failure.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.851
If I might be so old
as to interject here.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.989
Now, I will grant you that God's shoes
is somewhat, well, silly.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.292
But not any sillier than the pet rock,
the mood ring...

14:52.493 --> 14:54.294
...or, of course,
NBC's Sunday night line-up.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.265
Now, the point here is:

14:58.465 --> 15:02.336
Why don't we just give Dad a chance?
It might just work.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.705
Why didn't it work?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.840
Because it was a stupid idea, Daddy.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.308
I mean, if we think about it...

15:08.509 --> 15:10.110
...God probably doesn't
even need shoes.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.312
He can afford good carpeting.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.081
And if he ever needed anything...

15:14.281 --> 15:16.216
...like a Big Gulp
or batteries or something...

15:16.416 --> 15:19.052
...I'm sure the 7-Elevens up in heaven
don't have those signs that say:

15:19.253 --> 15:21.555
"No shirt, no shoes, no service."

15:22.456 --> 15:23.457
And even if they did...

15:23.657 --> 15:26.426
...who's gonna yank a Slim Jim
out of God's mouth?

15:27.895 --> 15:29.363
Or is all this
just going over your head?

15:29.563 --> 15:31.131
No, honey. No, it's not.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.268
It's just dancing around in there
with some of your other ponderings.

15:34.902 --> 15:36.270
Like, "What would a chair
look like...

15:36.470 --> 15:38.472
...if our knees were
in the back of our legs?"

15:42.342 --> 15:44.778
I made a teacher retire with that one.

15:45.579 --> 15:48.649
Yeah. Well, at least
there's something.

15:48.849 --> 15:49.850
What, Daddy?

15:50.050 --> 15:52.319
They're repossessing Marcie's car.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.488
I didn't know
they had a hood ornament.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.957
No, that's just
what's left of Jefferson.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.326
Well, at least
he's out of his pain now.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.329
You know, I sense you're getting down
on yourself, Daddy, and that's wrong.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.697
I mean, look on the bright side.

16:03.897 --> 16:06.667
Most men with your string of failures
would have long since have tasted...

16:06.867 --> 16:09.336
...the cold, cruel blade
of his own Ginsu by now.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.537
But not you, Daddy.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.407
You keep trying and that's
what makes you Daddy, Daddy.

16:13.607 --> 16:16.910
And as long as you don't tell
any of my friends, I love you.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.146
Well, thank you, pumpkin.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
That makes old Dad feel a lot better.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.784
Attadaddy.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.060
See, that's what I was talking about.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.030
Most men wouldn't bother to
flap their arms, but you keep trying.

16:40.467 --> 16:41.802
Daddy?

17:00.254 --> 17:01.622
You again.

17:03.991 --> 17:04.958
You're God?

17:05.592 --> 17:08.694
No. I'm Sidney Rimhollow.

17:08.896 --> 17:11.365
I was a shoe salesman
outside of Tulsa.

17:11.565 --> 17:14.935
I got the idea for these shoes
back in 1925.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.737
Didn't sell a one.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.873
But luckily, I had a loving wife
and two children...

17:20.073 --> 17:22.542
...who hired a hit man to kill me.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.978
Why didn't you tell me
the shoes were no good?

17:25.212 --> 17:28.482
Well, you thought I was God.
So I went along with it.

17:28.682 --> 17:30.350
You won't get away with it.
I'm telling God.

17:30.584 --> 17:33.020
- Where is he?
- No, no, no. He can't be disturbed.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.255
He's watching Knots Landing.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.959
I always wondered
why that show was never cancelled.

17:44.331 --> 17:48.202
Well, where's my cloud,
my harp and my virgin?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.638
Sorry, Al, you're not dead yet.

17:51.839 --> 17:54.641
But this time we're not
sending you back empty-handed.

17:54.842 --> 17:56.076
Listen. I got this idea...

17:58.712 --> 18:02.316
So you see, kids, there's really
no reason to worry about me anymore.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.117
I have divine guidance now.

18:04.318 --> 18:06.587
Sid and I put our heads together
and came up with a new idea.

18:06.787 --> 18:08.789
Shoehorn of Plenty.

18:08.989 --> 18:11.692
See, kids, it's kind of a combination
shoe store and burger joint.

18:11.892 --> 18:13.560
While you eat, you try on shoes.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.896
By the way, did I say
the burgers coming down the shoot...

18:16.096 --> 18:17.531
...will be shaped like a shoehorn?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.167
No, Dad, you didn't.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.736
Well, I can't take credit for that idea.
That was John Wayne.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.338
But you know
what our motto's gonna be?

18:24.538 --> 18:27.407
"If you're not shod,
the meal's on God."

18:28.275 --> 18:31.011
I guess that'll put to rest
those rumours of my insanity.
