WEBVTT

03:03.226 --> 03:04.793
Line.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.926
She thinks she'’s fooling us
with those sad, little eyes,

03:07.970 --> 03:09.972
but she'’s just like the others.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.887
Fear and pity.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.150
She'’ll betray us in the end.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.718
"Her hair is not
even really blonde."

03:57.802 --> 04:01.110
...since the time
of our earliest ancestors,

04:01.153 --> 04:04.809
an innate and essentially
human impulse.

04:04.853 --> 04:08.987
This very quality is what
separates man from beast.

04:09.031 --> 04:12.556
It is a manifestation
of our inherent desire

04:12.600 --> 04:16.603
"for order, for symmetry,
for beauty."

04:20.651 --> 04:23.219
That'’s it, that's it.

04:27.484 --> 04:30.008
Oh, gentle.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.362
-Doctor.
-Shh.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.375
Freida!

04:48.418 --> 04:50.464
Are you injured?

04:50.507 --> 04:51.813
I'’ll get Brutto.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.076
No, no, you can go.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.556
I'’ll see it to it myself.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.992
Let me speak with Freida alone.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.168
-But the patient...
-Never mind that.

04:59.211 --> 05:02.432
-But, doctor--
-Thank you, Olga.

05:02.476 --> 05:05.914
Yes, doctor, I'’ll be waiting.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.571
Freida, my dear.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.921
I warned you to stay
in your quarters.

05:12.964 --> 05:15.227
The patients
have very serious diseases.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.707
They are highly contagious.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.144
If anything ever were
to happen to you--

05:23.540 --> 05:25.368
That sounded like a real gun.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.717
Is everyone okay?

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
-What happened?
-Cut!

05:28.240 --> 05:29.546
-Cut!

05:29.590 --> 05:31.592
I think there are
hunters out there.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.159
If anything ever
were to happen to you,

05:34.203 --> 05:36.118
I'’d never forgive myself.

05:36.161 --> 05:37.728
My hero, Max.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.121
Yeah, well.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.429
Excuse me, who'’s in charge here?

05:42.472 --> 05:44.256
- Not me.
-Who is?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.128
Try Tetrallini.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.738
No, this one is imperfect.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.916
Yes, we will use this one.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.441
-Excuse me.
-No, out.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.791
-Ma'’am?
-Yes, this one is perfect.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.140
No, take this one away.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.228
Ma'’am, you need
to move your trucks.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.361
They'’re blocking our driveway.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.014
Who can I speak to about that?
Who'’s in charge here?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.189
-Coming through!
-Excuse me, who should

06:04.233 --> 06:05.626
I speak to about moving
the trucks.

06:05.669 --> 06:08.585
You need to talk
to Tetrallini about that.

06:08.629 --> 06:12.067
It'’s got an all-child cast.
Thought it was all dwarves.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.677
All children are dwarves,
Aristotle said that.

06:13.721 --> 06:14.896
Excuse me! Your trucks are
blocking our driveway.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.985
They need to move right now.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.161
Excuse me,
can you help me with this?

06:19.204 --> 06:22.207
Just ask who you wanna ask,
but just make sure...

06:22.251 --> 06:25.907
Do you know if the extras
have any dietary restrictions?

06:25.950 --> 06:28.997
-I was told iceberg lettuce--
-Tetrallini!

06:29.040 --> 06:30.433
Oh, excuse me.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.913
Sorry, is this the camera
you'’re shooting with?

06:31.956 --> 06:33.871
-Yeah, crazy, right?
-That'’s tiny.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.873
Yeah, they just keep getting
smaller and smaller these days.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.440
It'’s really all
about the lens, though.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.963
I could talk to you about that
if you want.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.269
-I'’m sure I can--
-Sarah Wagner.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.184
-Yeah.
-I'’m Joan Beckett.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.620
-Hi.
-I'’m here to interview Mabel.

06:43.664 --> 06:44.795
Oh great to meet you.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.057
-Oh yeah.
-Are you Tetrallini?

06:46.101 --> 06:47.276
-We just talked about that.
-Have you seen--

06:47.319 --> 06:48.538
have you seen Mabel?

06:48.582 --> 06:50.453
-No, you could talk to Molly.
-Tetrallini!

06:50.497 --> 06:52.324
Thank you.
I'’m a huge fan.

06:52.368 --> 06:54.457
-Oh, thank you.
-Tetrallini!

06:54.501 --> 06:58.548
"We wait in long line
for loaf of bread."

06:58.592 --> 06:59.941
I always wanted one,

06:59.984 --> 07:01.899
but it'’s such
a serious commitment.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.248
Marked for life.

07:03.292 --> 07:04.989
How do you think of a symbol

07:05.033 --> 07:06.948
that'’s completely unique to you

07:06.991 --> 07:09.777
and perfectly expresses
your individuality,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.474
like a barcode or something?

07:11.518 --> 07:14.259
My father says tattoos
are an insult to God.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.697
Now how would the tattooed
lady feel about that?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.612
Is there gonna be
a tattooed lady?

07:18.655 --> 07:20.440
We'’ll find out tomorrow.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.224
Tomorrow.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.487
I wonder if there'’ll be
a bearded lady.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.836
If not, I could play the part.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.795
Oh God, me too.

07:27.838 --> 07:30.232
You, I don'’t see anything
suspicious.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.364
Look, look.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.411
No, that'’s like wispy silk down.
I'’m an ape woman.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.847
You obviously know.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.675
I'’ve plucked much worse.

07:38.719 --> 07:39.981
Who?

07:40.024 --> 07:41.591
-Code of silence.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.202
I guess that'’s good.
I can trust you.

07:44.246 --> 07:46.553
Mabel, I wanted to
introduce you to Ms. Bechdel.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.077
-Beckett, Joan Beckett.
-Mabel.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.209
-Nice to meet you.
-Ms. Beckett, I'’m sorry.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.342
-She'’s writing the article.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.517
I'’ll talk to you at the hotel.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.214
I don'’t want to bother you now.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.826
That'’s all right. We're just
comparing facial hair.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.523
I have you all beat.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.612
I don'’t know.
You have stiff competition.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.048
Molly, how'’s your beard?

08:04.092 --> 08:05.441
Oh, electrolysis.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.269
Best 1100 bucks
I ever spent.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.923
Really, 1100?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.272
They do that here, I think,

08:10.315 --> 08:11.491
in the other wing.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.754
Female facial hair
is making a comeback.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.103
I doubt that.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.844
-Do you regret it now, Molly?
-No.

08:16.887 --> 08:20.021
It'’s true, armpit hair,
short hair, Afros,

08:20.064 --> 08:22.414
eyeglasses,
these things go in phases.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.547
-Scars are kind of a thing now.
-Joaquin Phoenix.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.767
Even small breasts
had a brief moment in history.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.899
I must'’ve missed that one.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.292
What about you, Michelle?

08:30.335 --> 08:31.685
You need any work done?

08:31.728 --> 08:33.600
-No, she'’s perfect.

08:46.264 --> 08:47.091
-Cut.
-Cut!

08:48.179 --> 08:49.703
Try it again but, uh,

08:49.746 --> 08:51.661
moving away from the girl.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.055
It'’d be more effective
as she becomes dwarfed

08:54.098 --> 08:54.969
by these lonely sh--

09:11.638 --> 09:12.813
-Cut.
-Cut!

09:12.856 --> 09:14.815
I guess so.

09:14.858 --> 09:17.861
Although, I don'’t
make those distinctions.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.863
Well, there'’s always
some distinction,

09:19.907 --> 09:23.388
in the working conditions,
for instance.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.781
Okay, yeah, well,

09:24.825 --> 09:26.740
on a film like this,
you kind of slum it.

09:26.783 --> 09:30.221
But I think that'’s part
of the appeal.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.789
Like, the beauty is that
it'’s more challenging,

09:32.833 --> 09:36.576
physically, mentally, and, um,

09:36.619 --> 09:38.621
also I'’m just a huge fan
of the director.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.754
It'’s his first American film.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.277
Yeah, but it still
retains a kind

09:42.320 --> 09:44.540
of European sensibility,

09:44.584 --> 09:47.412
which is one thing I love.

09:47.456 --> 09:50.285
And I don'’t get cast
in the mega-movie things anyway,

09:50.328 --> 09:52.113
so, I'’m not the type.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.811
You'’re being modest.
You'’re very beautiful.

09:54.855 --> 09:55.943
Thank you, but...

09:55.986 --> 09:58.206
Since we'’re on the topic,

09:58.249 --> 10:03.211
there are some bold casting
choices in this film.

10:06.562 --> 10:07.650
I guess.

10:07.694 --> 10:11.654
Do you have any
reservations about it?

10:11.698 --> 10:14.222
Reservations, like how?

10:14.265 --> 10:16.441
Um, I don'’t know.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.443
Do you feel, for example,

10:18.487 --> 10:23.666
this film might be
considered exploitative?

10:23.710 --> 10:27.061
You know, I think
that'’s up to the director.

10:27.104 --> 10:28.279
It'’s in the script.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.063
Have you read it?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.325
No.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.588
I think this is
something he relates to.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.416
He had very serious asthma,

10:34.459 --> 10:37.332
or something like that,
as a child.

10:37.375 --> 10:41.031
And so I think it'’s a very
personal, like, sad tale.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.816
And he said he grew up
in the circus,

10:42.859 --> 10:46.254
but I think he exaggerates.

10:46.297 --> 10:49.126
Playing a blind woman
must be challenging.

10:49.170 --> 10:53.087
Mm, but that'’s the job, right?

10:53.130 --> 10:55.089
Acting is acting.

10:55.132 --> 10:57.700
Like, um, Orson Welles,
who'’s white,

10:57.744 --> 11:00.572
can play Othello,
who'’s black, obviously,

11:00.616 --> 11:03.793
but then he can also turn
around and be the other--

11:03.837 --> 11:06.535
-Iago.
-Iago, right, if he wanted.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.711
Daniel Day-Lewis,
such a gifted actor,

11:08.755 --> 11:12.280
he can play--he played
a hopeless cripple,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.716
and then he turned around

11:13.760 --> 11:15.762
and played a great
American president.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.939
So that'’s a challenge.

11:18.982 --> 11:25.032
But blindness, it'’s also not
a totally foreign concept,

11:25.075 --> 11:28.470
because, you know,
blindness is an illness,

11:28.513 --> 11:32.126
but it'’s also a metaphor, right.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.781
We'’re all blind in certain ways.

11:34.824 --> 11:38.045
We'’re, like, blind to
our own best interests

11:38.088 --> 11:40.656
or blind to the suffering
of others.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.007
And I think that blind people,

11:44.051 --> 11:48.055
they feel shut...

11:48.098 --> 11:51.058
they feel excluded from, yeah,

11:51.101 --> 11:52.581
and I certainly relate to that.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.974
I'’m sure you do too.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.889
Sure.

11:55.932 --> 12:00.371
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow."

12:00.415 --> 12:01.764
Well, that'’s from that, uh,

12:01.808 --> 12:02.765
it'’s from a musical, right?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.941
It'’s the little rich orphan kid.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.203
What? No.

12:06.247 --> 12:10.773
"Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow creeps

12:10.817 --> 12:14.951
"in this petty pace
from day to day."

12:14.995 --> 12:15.865
Doesn'’t ring a bell, man.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.520
Everybody knows this.

12:18.563 --> 12:22.567
You sure it'’s not about
a rich orphan?

12:22.611 --> 12:23.786
Well, kind of.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.527
It'’s got an all-black cast.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.920
-American film?
-Are you fucking kidding me?

12:26.963 --> 12:29.400
-Yeah.
-First, the tattoos,

12:29.444 --> 12:32.360
then the mask is three weeks
late...

12:32.403 --> 12:33.840
I have a concern.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.407
-Maybe I'’m just not getting it.
-One moment, Mabel.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.020
Um, I was just thinking

12:40.063 --> 12:41.848
about the beauty of eyes

12:41.891 --> 12:43.197
or the measure of their beauty

12:43.240 --> 12:46.200
and it'’s not their shape.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.767
And can you tell
by touching them?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.159
What are you talking about?

12:49.203 --> 12:50.421
When she feels his face?

12:50.465 --> 12:51.727
Who does, whose face?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.468
Freida touches Rosenthal'’s face.

12:53.511 --> 12:54.643
And?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.297
Well, can she tell
by touching his face

12:56.340 --> 12:58.821
that he has beautiful eyes?

12:58.865 --> 13:01.824
Why are you bringing this
to me now?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
Well, I was just
thinking about it,

13:03.870 --> 13:06.568
and it doesn'’t make sense.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.222
Sure it does.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.312
But eyes are like moist,

13:11.355 --> 13:13.793
and I don'’t think
he wants her poking--

13:13.836 --> 13:15.707
She'’s not meant to
be sticking her fingers

13:15.751 --> 13:16.578
into his eye socket.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.014
Yeah, I know, I know.

13:18.058 --> 13:22.627
But aren'’t eyes, like,
all the same shape?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.151
I don'’t know that that's true.

13:24.194 --> 13:26.849
I don'’t see how you can
just make a statement like that.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.242
Can you touch a person'’s eyes

13:28.285 --> 13:29.939
and tell me
if they'’re beautiful or--

13:29.983 --> 13:31.288
Monstrous?

13:31.332 --> 13:33.464
Me, maybe no,
but I'’m not a blind.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.726
I don'’t read Braille.

13:34.770 --> 13:37.251
I don'’t have superhuman
musical abilities.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.339
But Freida--

13:38.382 --> 13:40.210
Beauty is in
the eye of the beholder.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.081
Disagree.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.038
Even if it is--

13:42.082 --> 13:43.300
It isn'’t.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.998
But eyes are, like,
considered beautiful,

13:45.041 --> 13:46.869
'’cause of their color,

13:46.913 --> 13:48.653
or maybe it'’s their placement,

13:48.697 --> 13:51.918
but it'’s not the way
they physically feel.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.224
You'’re saying that as
someone who has sight,

13:54.268 --> 13:55.225
as a seeing woman.

13:55.269 --> 13:56.879
You'’re not thinking like Freida.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.446
Vanessa, the script!

13:58.489 --> 14:00.013
At this ungodly hour.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.623
Sorry.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.754
Here.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.627
Read it.

14:05.670 --> 14:09.413
I have: "Rosenthal:"

14:09.457 --> 14:10.240
Page?

14:10.284 --> 14:12.547
118.

14:12.590 --> 14:13.722
So it'’s "Rosenthal:

14:13.765 --> 14:14.766
"'’Please, no, don't.'’

14:14.810 --> 14:15.898
"Freida:"

14:15.942 --> 14:17.421
"There'’s nothing
to be afraid of."

14:17.465 --> 14:18.901
"She places her hands
on his face,

14:18.945 --> 14:21.164
"feeling the contours of
his exaggerated features

14:21.208 --> 14:22.644
"but does so with a kind of
tenderness.

14:22.687 --> 14:23.775
"Rosenthal seems frightened

14:23.819 --> 14:25.386
"but also, in a sense, grateful.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.691
"Freida: '’I think
you'’re beautiful.'

14:26.735 --> 14:28.432
"Rosenthal: '’Me, beautiful?'

14:28.476 --> 14:30.739
"Freida: '’Especially your eyes,
"'’you have such beautiful eyes.'

14:30.782 --> 14:33.133
"Rosenthal: '’Why are you
so kind to me?'’"

14:33.176 --> 14:34.525
I don'’t know, it doesn't--

14:34.569 --> 14:36.005
It'’s not altogether logical,

14:36.049 --> 14:38.616
but it has a kind of
poetic truth,

14:38.660 --> 14:39.835
a rhapsodic truth.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.360
No, stop, don'’t smile.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.014
-I never do.
-It'’s true.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.755
That'’s the best way
to prevent wrinkles.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.452
I was joking. I smile.

14:48.496 --> 14:50.454
-Eh, Eh.
-Don'’t! Stop it!

14:50.498 --> 14:53.283
-You'’re gonna ruin it.
-God, when does it stop hurting.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.806
Oh, stop complaining.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.373
This isn'’t even available
to the public yet.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.940
You have to know somebody.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.028
Who do you know?

14:59.072 --> 15:00.508
Dr. Lichter.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.901
He lives in my mom'’s building.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.815
It'’s the same guy
who did Max'’s hair.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.208
Max'’s hair isn't real?

15:05.252 --> 15:06.731
I mean, it'’s real.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.733
It'’s stem cells or something.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.040
I don'’t know, possibly his own.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.217
What an amazing time
to be alive.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.351
Look, you'’re on TV.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.919
Jesus, everywhere I look,
there I am.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.572
Got to get used
to being seen sometime.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.184
I shall be saved by my husband.
He hath made me a Christian.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.360
Truly, the more to blame he.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.970
We were Christians
enough before.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.973
Even as many as could
well live one by another.

15:31.017 --> 15:33.933
This making Christians will
raise the price of hogs.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.891
Ugh, Shakespeare'’s the worst.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.024
That'’s the classiest
thing I'’ve ever done.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.678
-Until now.
-We'’ll see.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.245
All right,
I got to wash this off.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.899
No, it'’s working.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.553
-It'’s burning.
-Burning is good.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.077
-Give it time.
-How much time?

15:48.121 --> 15:51.167
Weeks, years, decades.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.126
I thought time was the enemy.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.128
Befriend the enemy.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.652
How long have you been using it?

15:57.695 --> 15:59.001
-Two days.
-Oh,

15:59.045 --> 16:02.004
your commitment
is truly astonishing.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.353
You laugh now

16:03.397 --> 16:05.616
but we'’ll see who's laughing
in 30 years.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.663
I never laugh, remember?

16:08.706 --> 16:09.881
I didn'’t say that.

16:09.925 --> 16:11.840
I said you never smile.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.546
We have an update
on a string of murders

16:22.590 --> 16:25.071
that has the whole
community living in fear.

16:25.114 --> 16:27.421
Now, police are seeking
a man for questioning.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.032
He'’s described as having
a mark on his face.

16:32.469 --> 16:37.866
He has these marks or scars
kind of burned on his face.

16:37.909 --> 16:41.609
They were on,
like, the left side.

16:41.652 --> 16:42.610
-Thank you.
-Well, no, actually,

16:42.653 --> 16:44.220
they were all over his face.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.222
But there was just something
really off about him.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.745
-I think he likes you.
-We'’ll no doubt be hearing

16:47.789 --> 16:49.747
more about this
as the case develops.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.358
In the meantime, please,

16:51.401 --> 16:53.621
keep your eyes open
and remain alert.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.498
I can'’t believe it.

17:12.901 --> 17:15.904
You'’re on television.

17:15.946 --> 17:17.992
I was hoping
nobody would notice.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.473
It'’s my early work.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.952
Nonsense.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.476
Of course, if you were
gonna do it faithfully,

17:22.519 --> 17:26.088
as Shakespeare would'’ve wanted
it performed,

17:26.132 --> 17:28.699
it'’d be an all-male cast.

17:28.743 --> 17:31.006
A modern interpretation.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.095
Which I support.

17:33.139 --> 17:37.360
Did you know our director
grew up in the circus?

17:37.404 --> 17:38.753
I heard.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.755
When I was a boy,

17:40.798 --> 17:42.322
that was my dream.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.759
That'’s a strange dream, I'd say.

17:44.802 --> 17:48.632
An experience like that
can really warp a man'’s mind.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.939
Maybe that'’s why
he'’s a genius.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.159
What was your childhood dream?

17:53.202 --> 17:56.553
Uh, it was to be a waitress.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.426
Easily realized.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.081
Yeah, pretty sure
that warped my mind.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.474
But I would still prefer
it to joining the circus.

18:04.518 --> 18:08.130
Oh no.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.176
Never happened for me, though.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.047
Poor Max.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.832
What will you dream about
tonight?

18:14.876 --> 18:16.182
My dreams are lame.

18:16.225 --> 18:18.793
It'’ll probably just be
about going to work.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.230
I'’ll be in it then.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.145
I never remember my dreams.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.712
Shame.

18:24.755 --> 18:28.237
I never forget mine.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.109
Get good sleep.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.328
Tomorrow,
all your dreams may come true.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.861
-Did you know Orson Welles--
-You know, sideshows have

18:43.905 --> 18:45.341
been around in one form or
another

18:45.385 --> 18:47.648
for hundreds of years.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.171
-And people criticize them.
-What'’s that Welles' movie

18:49.215 --> 18:50.520
-with the white Mexican?
-'’Cause people criticize

18:50.564 --> 18:51.521
the unknown,
that'’s a human impulse--

18:51.565 --> 18:53.871
Touch of Evil, Charlton Heston.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.483
Isn'’t there a different one
with a woman,

18:56.526 --> 18:58.833
-a white Mexican woman?
-But in reality,

18:58.876 --> 19:01.705
sideshows benefited
people with disabilities

19:01.749 --> 19:05.144
who had no other means
of supporting themselves.

19:05.187 --> 19:09.539
Who'’s gonna employ them in like
the 1930s, the president?

19:09.583 --> 19:13.456
-I'’m gonna--
-Nicole Kidman as an American.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.242
Is that a drone?

19:16.285 --> 19:17.982
I think it'’s a drone.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.169
It is so good to meet--

19:30.212 --> 19:31.779
It is really nice to meet you.

19:31.822 --> 19:32.910
What are you doing?

19:34.303 --> 19:36.653
-I just have to wash my hands.
-Me too.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.351
But I didn'’t say anything.

20:12.646 --> 20:13.864
-Oh!
-Oh, I'’m--I'm sorry.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.344
No, I didn'’t, um--

20:15.388 --> 20:17.085
No, I didn'’t know
anyone was in here.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.434
-I'’m sorry.
-My fault.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.827
No, no, no, no, no.
No, it'’s not your fault.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.742
-It'’s not your fault at all.
-Do you need help?

20:21.785 --> 20:24.614
No, it'’s just my medication.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.748
-It'’s my bad, sorry.
-No, no.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.663
Crafty'’s down there.
Holding is down there.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.100
Restrooms are upstairs.
Elevators are broken.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.711
This is Michelle, our fabulous
makeup girl, be nice to her.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.757
-We doing makeup with them?
-I don'’t know.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.149
Mabel, where have you been
hiding?

20:38.193 --> 20:40.413
You'’ve got to meet Rosenthal.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.374
Hi, honor, pleasure.

20:45.418 --> 20:48.072
-Hi, yeah, nice to--
-Mabel, wardrobe meeting.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.031
We got a movie on our hands.
Right this way, guys,

20:50.074 --> 20:51.380
your rooms are at
the end of the hall.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.686
Don'’t tell me, don't tell me,

20:52.729 --> 20:54.514
Phrosa,

20:54.557 --> 20:55.906
Clementine,

20:55.950 --> 20:56.994
Nora,

20:57.038 --> 20:58.431
the Mozes twins, Eve and Miriam,

20:58.474 --> 21:00.215
that'’s an easy one.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.825
Okay, everyone,

21:01.869 --> 21:03.218
you can grab a bed

21:03.262 --> 21:06.482
and get a toothbrush
and a washcloth.

21:06.526 --> 21:10.921
Okay, who'’s been in a film
before--I'’m sorry, a movie?

21:10.965 --> 21:12.314
-Who'’s been in a movie before?
-Oh, I have.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.620
You have, what have you been in?

21:13.663 --> 21:15.317
It was called
Triumph of the Ill.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.277
Triumph of the Ill,
that'’s a great title.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.322
-Yeah, it'’s good.
-I don'’t think it ever came out.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.628
Well, it happens.

21:21.671 --> 21:24.152
You, Aristotle, have you
been in a film before?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.937
One was called
Life Unworthy of Life,

21:26.981 --> 21:29.679
and the other, I think it
was called Enemy of the Gods.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.247
-Uh, Gods'’ Mistakes.
-Yes, Gods'’ Mistakes.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.162
Enemy of the Gods
was the German title.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.599
-Feind der Goötter.
-I think I saw that, actually.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.907
How was it?

21:39.950 --> 21:41.430
Powerful.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.476
If it'’s the
one I'’m thinking of.

21:45.695 --> 21:48.394
Max, you bring the doctors
out here,

21:48.437 --> 21:49.786
one doctor, out.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.833
Yes, come forward,
and you see it, up!

21:52.876 --> 21:56.576
You, up, up!
Do the walk, do the walk.

21:56.619 --> 22:00.580
Now you see him,
but you do not observe him.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.886
You'’re still moving,
still moving.

22:02.930 --> 22:06.368
-"They turn away in horror."
-Little lower!

22:06.412 --> 22:08.196
-"They taunt me."
-Lower, higher.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.285
-"And beg me to show my face."
-Up, up!

22:10.329 --> 22:11.678
"Only so that when I do,

22:11.721 --> 22:15.899
"they can turn away in horror."

22:15.943 --> 22:19.555
"They taunt me and beg me
to show my face.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.557
"Only so that that when I do,

22:21.601 --> 22:25.256
"they can turn away in horror."

22:25.300 --> 22:26.257
"They taunt me--"

22:26.301 --> 22:28.390
Hey, you'’re all alone over here.

22:28.434 --> 22:31.567
All this dialogue,
it just goes on and on.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.308
I can'’t remember it.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.789
Oh, everyone'’s nervous
on their first day of a shoot.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.268
I don'’t want to mess this up.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.836
Our director is intimidating.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.316
You know, he'’s not really.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.361
It'’s his accent.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.145
It makes him sound
like a villain.

22:44.188 --> 22:48.367
How am I possibly supposed
to remember all these lines?

22:48.410 --> 22:49.803
Lines are the easy part.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.282
You'’ve done this before, yeah?

22:51.326 --> 22:54.547
If a school play counts,
then sure.

22:54.590 --> 22:58.333
Yeah, this is gonna
be a piece of cake then.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.769
Do you have representation?

22:59.813 --> 23:01.249
Representation?

23:01.292 --> 23:07.124
-Yeah.
-No, not that I know of.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.170
Okay, so the first trick
to learning your lines

23:09.213 --> 23:11.259
is to stop worrying.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.000
I'’m on this medication.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.307
It affects my memory
or something.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.353
Well, we'’ll rehearse
together if you like.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.180
Yeah, thank you.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.573
That'’s very kind of you.

23:20.616 --> 23:23.097
I could pay you for lessons.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.578
No, I'’d be a hopeless teacher.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.101
I'’m terrible with kids.

23:27.144 --> 23:30.278
Yeah, kids hate me, too.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.497
That'’s ridiculous.

23:31.540 --> 23:35.065
No, they'’re genuinely
terrified of me.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.284
I think you'’re paranoid,

23:36.327 --> 23:39.330
because children are like
mindless drones.

23:39.374 --> 23:40.854
It'’s probably that
you'’re afraid of them.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.334
Oh, I'’m absolutely
afraid of them.

23:43.378 --> 23:46.425
So you'’re not,
you'’re not a father then?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.818
No.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.560
Like, do you have a dog
or a cat?

23:51.604 --> 23:53.083
Oh no, they hate me too.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.434
Dogs bark at me
and cats tend to hiss at me.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.785
All right,
now I know you'’re kidding.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.961
No, anything below cat or dog:

24:01.004 --> 24:03.006
Snail, cockroach, plankton,

24:03.050 --> 24:05.661
they'’re mildly
indifferent to me.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.358
You'’re hilarious.

24:07.402 --> 24:08.838
All right, I'’m on to you.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.232
I think you'’re trying
to lower my expectations

24:11.275 --> 24:12.581
so that you can run away
with the movie

24:12.625 --> 24:14.322
and put me to shame.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.543
I'’d need to know my lines
before I could do that.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.936
You wouldn'’t be the first actor
that didn'’t know their lines.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.416
But I'’ll help you
if you need it,

24:21.460 --> 24:23.766
which you don'’t.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.594
You don'’t seem convinced.

24:29.380 --> 24:30.860
What do you want to know?

24:30.904 --> 24:32.340
How to act.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.994
That'’s all?

24:34.037 --> 24:36.779
Just start
from the beginning.

24:36.823 --> 24:40.261
Hmm, name an emotion.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.610
An emotion?

24:41.654 --> 24:44.787
Yeah, just name one,
like any emotion.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.747
I can'’t think of one.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.444
You can'’t think of an emotion?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.141
Is that the medication, too?

24:51.185 --> 24:54.841
Yeah, maybe.

24:54.884 --> 24:58.322
Like, sadness.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.716
Okay, sadness.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.548
See?

25:06.592 --> 25:07.854
Acting.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.899
Okay.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.118
All right, I'’ve got one.

25:11.161 --> 25:12.336
Great.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.947
Happiness.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.731
Hmm, opposite of sadness.

25:15.775 --> 25:17.167
That'’s what I hear.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.168
I have to remember.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.344
Um...

25:24.566 --> 25:25.480
Oh yeah.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.612
You'’re ecstatic.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.135
So you think.

25:28.178 --> 25:31.704
Okay, okay, let'’s try fear.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.796
Yeah, I recognize that reaction.

25:36.839 --> 25:41.148
Okay, how about empathy?

25:43.237 --> 25:45.500
Empathy?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.895
That'’s--that one's
very advanced.

25:48.938 --> 25:51.811
Um, a minute ago, you
couldn'’t name any emotion.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.291
Yeah, but they'’re all
coming back to me now.

25:54.335 --> 25:58.774
So empathy,
in three, two, one, action.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.564
Ah, it looks a lot like pity.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.740
But all the same, I'’m touched.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.656
You'’re really very talented,
I must say.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.396
Tell my father that.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.137
And did you like
how I shouted action?

26:14.181 --> 26:17.445
So good,
but that one'’s not your job.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.186
Ah, I thought I'’d be bold.

26:19.229 --> 26:20.709
Oh wait, you didn'’t say cut.

26:20.753 --> 26:21.884
So the scene'’s
still going on?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.407
Oh yeah, it'’s your turn.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.453
-No, no, no.
-No, happiness.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.846
That'’s actually unfair,

26:26.889 --> 26:29.065
because I'’m already
really happy anyway.

26:29.109 --> 26:30.589
Look, check it,
see how happy I am?

26:30.632 --> 26:32.591
See how actually
for real happy I am.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.027
Clearly.

26:34.070 --> 26:38.640
Uh, hair and makeup'’s
ready for you.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.686
Keep the shadow
out of the frame.

26:40.729 --> 26:42.470
Take it out of the frame.

26:42.513 --> 26:43.776
Maybe we want it in the frame.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.082
Is that good?

26:46.126 --> 26:48.258
Highlights the artificiality.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.564
And his reaction was,

26:49.608 --> 26:52.001
I see this as being very
damaging to capitalism.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.133
If only.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.482
Aren'’t his movies on there?

26:54.525 --> 26:56.353
Yeah, all 11,
including the shorts.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.573
He said, I don'’t make movies
to make money,

26:58.617 --> 27:00.531
I want people to see them!

27:02.055 --> 27:04.013
-Hey!
-Yes, officer.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.625
Anybody you notice
with identifying markings

27:06.668 --> 27:09.932
or characteristics,
scars, amputations--

27:09.976 --> 27:11.064
-Uh, let me--
-Tattoos.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.761
Let me get you Tetrallini...

27:12.805 --> 27:14.241
If you just stay right there,
I'’ll just be right back, okay?

27:14.284 --> 27:16.069
Stay right there.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.989
Come forward, forward.

27:23.032 --> 27:27.689
Come right there, there, stop.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.473
Up!

27:29.517 --> 27:32.781
Stop!

27:32.825 --> 27:36.567
Rosenthal,
just stand in the shadows,

27:36.611 --> 27:40.354
and when I say action, you
stand there for a few seconds.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.573
Mabel will speak her line.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.533
-Then walk out into the light.
-Walk out?

27:45.576 --> 27:49.406
Step out of the shadows
and into the light.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.060
-Got it.
-Let us now try it.

27:51.104 --> 27:53.759
This is just a rehearsal.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.242
Action!

27:59.286 --> 28:00.679
Who'’s there?

28:03.333 --> 28:04.378
Don'’t be frightened.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.814
No, but you
need to say it exactly

28:05.858 --> 28:10.079
as you'’re emerging from
the shadows into the light.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.257
Who'’s there?

28:16.042 --> 28:17.870
-Don'’t be frightened.
-Cut, no, no.

28:17.913 --> 28:22.265
First,
wait five seconds.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.746
-Okay, sorry.
-And just step,

28:24.790 --> 28:26.400
do not just walk out.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.315
-Don'’t?
-Step out.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.795
So one step?

28:29.838 --> 28:33.799
A solitary step
out of the shadows

28:33.842 --> 28:35.322
and into the light.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.367
-Okay.
-Can we try it?

28:40.980 --> 28:42.416
Who'’s there?

28:44.723 --> 28:46.637
Don'’t be frightened.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.422
That was better, much better,

28:48.465 --> 28:52.905
but you still, you must step,

28:52.948 --> 28:55.168
make your reach longer.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.126
The shadow is still,

28:57.170 --> 28:59.912
we shall conquer this problem.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.609
Maybe we can move
the light back.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.698
The light is beautiful,
if he would just do as I asked

29:03.742 --> 29:05.526
and lengthen his step.

29:07.615 --> 29:10.357
Mark it, put a mark down.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.188
Rosenthal, step to the tape,

29:15.231 --> 29:16.406
but do not look at the tape.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.713
You must understand.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.410
Who'’s there?

29:22.630 --> 29:25.415
Don'’t be frightened.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.852
Progress.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.552
Am I standing too long
in the shadows?

29:31.595 --> 29:34.816
No, in fact,
is it long enough?

29:34.860 --> 29:36.383
How does it appear, Frank?

29:36.426 --> 29:38.124
Where'’s Frank?

29:41.083 --> 29:43.651
Why am I standing
in the shadows?

29:43.694 --> 29:46.523
Because this is your entrance.

29:46.567 --> 29:48.090
From where?

29:48.134 --> 29:49.309
For the entire film;

29:49.352 --> 29:52.268
this is your introduction
as a character,

29:52.312 --> 29:54.444
to the audience,
to the paying public.

29:54.488 --> 29:57.839
So far, you have been
seen only in shadows.

29:57.883 --> 30:04.193
But your face, your identity,
is a mystery.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.587
And what exactly am I doing?

30:06.630 --> 30:09.590
-Just standing there.
-Standing there?

30:09.633 --> 30:13.289
It feels unnatural,
because it is stylized,

30:13.333 --> 30:16.379
maximum effectiveness.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.555
I'’m just asking to get a
feel for the whole thing.

30:18.599 --> 30:19.818
-So, like, what is--
-You are hiding

30:19.861 --> 30:22.385
in the shadows,
because you are afraid,

30:22.429 --> 30:24.257
because you are
in an unfamiliar place,

30:24.300 --> 30:27.260
and you sense something
is not right here.

30:27.303 --> 30:30.045
So you are hiding,
because you smell fear.

30:30.089 --> 30:31.525
And then I just walk out?

30:31.568 --> 30:33.266
You do not walk out.

30:33.309 --> 30:36.530
You step out into the light.

30:36.573 --> 30:37.792
It is an introduction.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.881
It is an amazing moment

30:39.925 --> 30:43.189
because the audience
has not seen you yet.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.192
You have been withheld

30:46.235 --> 30:50.892
just like Orson Welles
in The Muppet Movie.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.328
You'’ve seen this movie, no?

30:52.372 --> 30:54.200
-No.
-You know, these Muppets,

30:54.243 --> 30:55.375
you would like them.

30:55.418 --> 30:58.900
They are not fully beasts

30:58.944 --> 31:01.381
and not fully human.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.383
They are half-breeds,

31:03.426 --> 31:05.428
like the great god, Anubis.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.256
Yeah, I know who
the Muppets are.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.172
These half-men, these Muppets,

31:10.216 --> 31:13.175
have spent the whole motion
picture sojourning westward

31:13.219 --> 31:15.525
across the entire
United States of America

31:15.569 --> 31:20.052
to go to Hollywood,
to see this big studio man.

31:20.095 --> 31:22.968
When they finally reach
the motion picture studio,

31:23.011 --> 31:25.884
after a grueling journey,

31:25.927 --> 31:29.583
they connive their way past
the no-trespassing signs,

31:29.626 --> 31:31.759
past the uniformed officers.

31:31.802 --> 31:35.545
They walk into this big
studio man'’s office.

31:35.589 --> 31:38.418
And the big studio man is there.

31:38.461 --> 31:43.597
This essential man upon
whom everything depends.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.165
But we do not see him just yet,

31:46.208 --> 31:51.648
for he has his back turned
to the Muppets and to us.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.869
And we think it will
just be some regular man.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.090
But then he turns in his chair,

31:58.133 --> 32:03.095
and we delight in the discovery
that it is Orson Welles.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.053
It is a fabulous surprise
for the audience,

32:05.097 --> 32:06.359
for the paying public,

32:06.402 --> 32:11.712
a kind of, how would you
say, a reward, a shock.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.496
Their money'’s worth.

32:13.540 --> 32:17.109
We do not know who stands here

32:17.152 --> 32:18.893
in these shadows.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.200
It could be Orson Welles.

32:21.243 --> 32:23.550
It could be anybody.

32:23.593 --> 32:25.160
But it is you, in this case,

32:25.204 --> 32:28.076
and it will create
a very nice moment.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.991
-Okay.
-Is that clear?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.210
-Sure.
-Is it clear?

32:31.253 --> 32:32.472
I think so.

32:32.515 --> 32:33.821
Let us do it this time

32:33.864 --> 32:35.344
with Freida'’s line first,

32:35.388 --> 32:36.432
and let us really shoot it

32:36.476 --> 32:37.607
because this is digital.

32:37.651 --> 32:38.869
We can just shoot everything.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.436
We should'’ve been
shooting all of this.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.048
Hey, hey, great stuff, man.
You got a gift.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.832
-Come see the baby.
-What baby?

32:44.875 --> 32:46.660
For the baby scene.
It'’s a tiny, little actor.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.488
We should--
oh, babies hate you.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.056
-Yeah.
-Children and dogs hate him.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.014
-Oh, that simply isn'’t true.
-And cats.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.973
Everything
but single-celled organisms.

32:55.016 --> 32:58.019
-That'’s not exactly what I said.
-Dogs love everybody.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.890
Not me, they smell fear.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.197
Why are you so hard on yourself?

33:02.241 --> 33:05.244
-No, don'’t cry.
-No, no, dogs are innocent.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.810
-Look, see how good?
-Nein!

33:06.854 --> 33:08.987
The suffering must be real.

33:09.030 --> 33:11.467
This is just Frank.
Imagine if we get Mel Gibson--

33:11.511 --> 33:13.034
-No!
-Or Kevin Spacey.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.644
-No!
-This is just a mock-up.

33:14.688 --> 33:17.125
It is essential
that his maladies be real.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.954
That is the code that
I have sworn to honor.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.304
Besides it would be too
expensive to get a real actor.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.350
Then we must do
so much hours of makeup

33:24.393 --> 33:26.004
and prosthetics every day.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.788
Well, actually, with the
insurance and liabilities,

33:27.831 --> 33:29.746
I don'’t want you to have to
worry about any of that, though.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.139
Or we do it digitally.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.924
I mean, digital effects
are the plastic surgery

33:33.968 --> 33:35.361
of the moving image.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.276
I mean, a little touch-up
here and there,

33:37.319 --> 33:39.582
like nothing too noticeable.
I don'’t know.

33:39.626 --> 33:42.498
It'’s just an amazing time
to be alive.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.935
She thinks she'’s fooling us
with those sad, little eyes,

33:44.979 --> 33:46.850
but she'’s just like the others.

33:46.894 --> 33:49.418
-Fear and pity.
-She'’ll betray us in the end.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.159
Her hair'’s not even
really blonde.

33:58.123 --> 33:59.080
Mabel.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.387
Mabel, new pages for you.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.258
-Thank you.
-Yup.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.159
What kind of camera?

34:35.203 --> 34:37.379
-Oh, this is--
-Oh I knew it!

34:37.422 --> 34:39.077
A celluloid man.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.731
Yeah, just don'’t open the--

34:41.775 --> 34:43.385
Some people say
there'’s no difference.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.995
Not me, I'’m like you.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.518
Don'’t have your eye, but...

34:46.562 --> 34:48.650
you talk to Matt,
set photographer?

34:48.695 --> 34:50.043
I'’ve seen him around,

34:50.088 --> 34:51.784
but I don'’t think
I'’ve spoken to him.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.221
I'’ll introduce you.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.136
He'’s competent.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.443
Shoots digital,
like everybody these days.

34:57.486 --> 34:58.792
Makes sense in his line of work.

34:58.835 --> 35:02.839
But he'’s not doing
what you'’re doing.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.363
You got a natural talent,

35:04.406 --> 35:06.060
acting, photography.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.628
Things just come easy to you.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.412
Thanks, if you say so.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.979
I do say so.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.894
I admire your gift,

35:13.937 --> 35:18.464
even if it is God-given,
so to speak.

35:18.507 --> 35:22.424
Yeah, everything has been
really interesting so far.

35:22.468 --> 35:24.426
I'’d love to get a photo.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.993
Sure, that'’d be great.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.996
Hey, you, come take our picture.

35:33.348 --> 35:35.176
Come.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.483
I'’d rather you took it,
but it'’s impossible.

35:37.526 --> 35:38.788
Ah, we could take a selfie.

35:38.832 --> 35:40.573
Selfies.

35:40.616 --> 35:42.052
Ready?

35:42.096 --> 35:45.447
-Three, two, one.

35:45.491 --> 35:49.625
Wait, wait, one more.

35:49.669 --> 35:52.193
-Okay, ready?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.064
You want one?

35:54.108 --> 35:56.154
Uh, sure, if that'’s cool.

36:02.595 --> 36:07.513
All right, three, two, one,

36:07.556 --> 36:08.818
smile!

36:11.125 --> 36:12.822
Back to work.

36:12.866 --> 36:13.910
That was great.

36:13.954 --> 36:16.217
I want a copy of this.

36:16.261 --> 36:18.959
You probably develop it
yourself.

36:19.002 --> 36:21.222
No, I don'’t really like
to mess with the chemicals.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.528
And I'’m on this
medication that--

36:22.571 --> 36:24.878
Do you not like me
for some reason?

36:24.921 --> 36:26.358
I don'’t know you.

36:29.012 --> 36:31.624
I am who I am.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.930
I can'’t change, so...

36:33.974 --> 36:35.932
I like you, yeah.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.370
Happy to hear it.

36:38.413 --> 36:39.893
I like you, too.

36:39.936 --> 36:41.460
I respect you.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.549
You'’d make a great
Richard the Third.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.115
Olivier undermined
the whole part,

36:45.159 --> 36:47.814
because he was too vain
to be defective.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.904
Not me, I'’d slather my
whole face with latex.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.732
It would suit me.
I hate to be looked at.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.603
I was an Arab woman
in my former life.

36:54.647 --> 36:55.865
I really believe that.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.954
That'’s why I'm ashamed
to show my face.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.565
I'’m insanely shy.

36:59.608 --> 37:02.698
Yeah, I'’m kind of shy, too.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.570
Oh, you'’re not shy.

37:04.613 --> 37:07.573
You'’re contemplative,
circumspect.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.881
Guarded?

37:15.798 --> 37:17.017
-Who do you think you are?
- Sorry.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.627
This is not a playground.

37:18.671 --> 37:21.935
Your people are running
around, over by our side,

37:21.978 --> 37:24.285
right near our patients
and families.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.852
They'’re scaring the children.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.810
I don'’t think they should
be left on their own.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.508
I warned Goodrich
that this would happen,

37:29.551 --> 37:31.292
but no one listens to me.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.815
This place is so big.

37:32.859 --> 37:35.427
We'’re the oldest and
largest hospital in the state.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.429
It was funded by Carnegie.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.735
We were forced to close
in the 1950s,

37:39.779 --> 37:42.651
but in 2001,
Dr. Goodrich reopened it.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.392
Look.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.843
It was an all-female cast.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.541
Oh yeah,
I did see that one.

38:02.584 --> 38:05.848
Have you talked to Rosenthal?

38:05.892 --> 38:07.850
He'’s amazing.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.896
Mabel seems to like him.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.377
I need to talk to somebody.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.901
Who am I gonna talk to?

38:14.944 --> 38:16.294
Phrosa and Aristotle,

38:16.337 --> 38:18.818
let'’s talk to them.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.820
Oh damn it.

38:20.863 --> 38:23.997
Stella, I like her.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.869
Fascinating.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.745
I love the struggle.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.486
Who'’s that girl Rosenthal's
talking to?

38:37.489 --> 38:40.143
"Heard melodies are sweet,

38:40.187 --> 38:42.885
"but those unheard are sweeter.

38:42.929 --> 38:46.541
"Therefore, ye soft pipes,
play on."

38:46.585 --> 38:49.239
There'’s a bearded lady
after all.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.632
Guess I didn'’t get the part.

38:50.676 --> 38:51.590
It'’s not too late.

38:51.633 --> 38:54.723
The movie'’s not over.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.683
Who is that
dancing with Rosenthal?

38:57.726 --> 39:00.512
I think she'’s his wife.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.035
I didn'’t know he was married.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.693
What do you think
about the Siamese twins?

39:07.736 --> 39:09.129
Eva and Miriam?

39:09.172 --> 39:10.870
Very pretty.

39:10.913 --> 39:14.308
Yeah, but I don'’t think
they'’re real.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.266
What do you mean?

39:16.310 --> 39:18.878
I mean, I think that Siamese
twins have been phased out,

39:18.921 --> 39:21.054
you know, like, at least
in the First World.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.665
Well, maybe those two couldn'’t
be separated for some reason.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.406
If they were attached
at the skull maybe,

39:25.450 --> 39:27.582
but at the hip like that,

39:27.626 --> 39:28.844
that'’s, like,
a simple procedure.

39:28.888 --> 39:31.412
They could do that
in the Carnegie wing.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.283
Maybe.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.199
Well, they'’re twins, anyway.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.984
Sure, sure.

39:38.027 --> 39:41.988
And that one,
the half-man, half-woman.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.424
Jack-Jacqueline.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.861
She doesn'’t talk much.

39:45.905 --> 39:47.428
Or is it a he?

39:47.472 --> 39:49.169
I mean, it has to be
one or the other.

39:49.212 --> 39:51.127
All right,
that'’s not a real thing.

39:51.171 --> 39:53.434
A hermaphrodite? Sure.

39:53.478 --> 39:56.306
Yeah, but, like, split
down the middle like that,

39:56.350 --> 39:58.439
she'’s a fraud.

39:58.483 --> 40:01.050
I think it'’s a he.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.835
He'’s a fraud.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.751
Well,
Rosenthal'’s definitely real

40:05.794 --> 40:08.754
and Brutto, the little person.

40:08.797 --> 40:12.453
It'’s a pretty impressive lineup.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.760
How do you know she'’s his wife?

40:14.803 --> 40:17.502
I don'’t know.
I just kind of assumed.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.289
Who is that?

40:24.857 --> 40:28.208
That'’s you,
after you get burned.

40:30.515 --> 40:33.996
I thought that it was just
gonna be one quick shot.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.520
Real suffering.

40:35.563 --> 40:39.262
"We must honor this code."

40:39.306 --> 40:42.831
And I also don'’t think that
the director'’s actually German.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.268
They say he grew up
in the circus.

40:45.312 --> 40:48.010
I view it as a form
of cinematic hygiene.

40:48.054 --> 40:50.230
We tell ourselves
stories in order to live.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.361
That'’s great.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.928
Who said that?

40:52.972 --> 40:54.800
-Did you make that up?

40:54.843 --> 40:56.628
Be careful of that fucking pig.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.499
I'’m not an animal.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.288
We'’re the oldest and
largest hospital in the state.

41:05.332 --> 41:08.335
It was funded by Carnegie.

41:08.378 --> 41:11.338
-She'’s beautiful.
-Who?

41:11.381 --> 41:14.515
The, um, Japanese girl
you were dancing with.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.648
Oh yeah, her.

41:16.691 --> 41:17.953
She'’s your wife?

41:17.997 --> 41:20.260
Yeah.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.131
Uh, how, how did you meet?

41:22.175 --> 41:26.092
I'’ve never seen her
before in my life.

41:26.135 --> 41:27.485
You'’re not married.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.660
No, not me.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.097
I'’ll be a bachelor 'til I die.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.272
Why do you say that?

41:32.315 --> 41:33.795
I mean, there'’s someone
for everyone.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.711
Ah, maybe I'’m just
a bit too picky.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.758
What about you?
Are you married?

41:39.801 --> 41:41.847
So we'’re both picky.

41:41.890 --> 41:43.631
Eh, I blame my father.

41:43.675 --> 41:45.067
No one was ever
good enough for me,

41:45.111 --> 41:49.289
or maybe I wasn'’t
good enough for anyone.

41:49.332 --> 41:52.988
Anyway, um, you,

41:53.032 --> 41:54.816
you saw the new pages?

41:54.860 --> 41:56.557
Oh, my God, yeah.

41:56.601 --> 41:59.734
-I'’m, I'm so sorry.
-Why are you sorry?

41:59.778 --> 42:01.431
Well, '’cause I assume
you didn'’t sign up

42:01.475 --> 42:03.608
to do that thing with me.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.914
And if you don'’t
want to do that,

42:05.958 --> 42:07.699
I can totally back you up.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.048
Is it a problem for you?

42:09.091 --> 42:10.353
No, no, I'’ll do what I'm told

42:10.397 --> 42:12.138
and whatever the scene
calls for.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.618
It'’s a visual medium, right?

42:13.661 --> 42:15.271
It might be really effective.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.490
You sound like Max.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.883
We could demand stunt doubles.

42:17.926 --> 42:19.754
I don'’t know
if lovemaking counts

42:19.798 --> 42:21.582
as a stunt.

42:21.626 --> 42:25.325
Anyway, it won'’t be so bad,
will it?

42:25.368 --> 42:26.718
Smile!

42:26.761 --> 42:28.458
Don'’t look too happy.

42:28.502 --> 42:29.808
His wife will be jealous.

42:29.851 --> 42:30.896
She'’s not his wife.

42:30.939 --> 42:32.854
That'’s my camera.

42:39.469 --> 42:40.993
Hey, what happened
to the others?

42:41.036 --> 42:42.168
Where'’s Rosenthal?

42:42.211 --> 42:43.386
Oh, he'’s not coming.

42:43.430 --> 42:44.779
They'’re staying here.

42:44.823 --> 42:46.433
-What?
-The hotel'’s too small

42:46.476 --> 42:48.261
and it'’s not
handicapped-accessible.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.393
There are plenty of beds
at the hospital.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.048
Plus, they'’re guarding the
camera equipment, too, so...

42:53.092 --> 42:54.659
Yeah, but if the hotel
is built for the hospital,

42:54.702 --> 42:56.312
why wouldn'’t it be
handicapped-accessible?

42:56.356 --> 42:59.228
Built in less
enlightened times, I guess.

42:59.272 --> 43:01.579
Hey, are they alone in there?

43:01.622 --> 43:05.278
I'’d give a million dollars
to know what goes on in there.

43:20.989 --> 43:23.470
Are you going back out tonight?

43:23.513 --> 43:25.385
That'’s kind of
a personal question.

43:25.428 --> 43:27.343
We'’re locking the doors early.

43:27.387 --> 43:29.041
A body was found
just up the road.

43:29.084 --> 43:30.738
Dead?
The killer.

43:30.782 --> 43:32.000
We might have walked
right by him.

43:32.044 --> 43:33.785
They spotted a man in the woods.

43:33.828 --> 43:35.874
He'’s real kind of messed up
looking:

43:35.917 --> 43:38.180
Scars or something.

43:38.224 --> 43:42.010
Well, don'’t look at me.
I don'’t have any scars, clean.

43:42.054 --> 43:44.230
I don'’t have any
distinguishing features,

43:44.273 --> 43:47.842
not even a, what do you call it,
a mole.

43:47.886 --> 43:51.280
That is your distinguishing
feature, total blandness.

43:53.456 --> 43:54.980
-Herr Director?
-Yeah, yeah.

43:55.023 --> 43:56.721
Which do you prefer
for the portrait

43:56.764 --> 43:58.723
Rosenthal paints of Freida?

43:58.766 --> 44:00.550
Well, well, ideally,

44:00.594 --> 44:02.161
I'’d like to use
this abstract one.

44:02.204 --> 44:05.251
It is almost as if she
is becoming one of them.

44:05.294 --> 44:06.774
Yeah, but can you tell it'’s her?

44:06.818 --> 44:11.953
Hmm, unfortunately,
it is not so obvious.

45:48.049 --> 45:51.400
Uh, where is everybody?

45:51.444 --> 45:54.099
Camera'’s busted.
We can'’t shoot.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.709
Everybody'’s in the auditorium.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.798
They'’re gonna screen dailies.

45:57.842 --> 45:59.452
Oh.

46:36.489 --> 46:37.969
-I love him.
-I love him.

46:38.012 --> 46:39.753
Sounds convincing, action.

46:39.797 --> 46:40.754
I love him.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.843
What a horrible thought.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.149
A beast.

46:44.192 --> 46:46.934
Surely you know
I could never allow it.

46:46.978 --> 46:49.328
Max, put your hand--

46:49.371 --> 46:50.590
Turn your
head slightly for me.

46:50.633 --> 46:52.505
Yes, yes, that'’s perfect.

46:52.548 --> 46:54.855
When I paint,
I can remake the world

46:54.899 --> 46:56.552
as I wish it to be.

46:56.596 --> 46:58.119
Brother says he'’s getting close.

46:58.163 --> 46:59.860
I do not want
to get my hopes up,

46:59.904 --> 47:03.429
but to think that then
I'’ll see all the colors.

47:03.472 --> 47:05.257
Then I can see you.

47:05.300 --> 47:07.128
Drop the paintbrush.

47:07.172 --> 47:10.958
I'’m--I'm happy,
if you could see,

47:11.002 --> 47:13.787
you, so young, so beautiful.

47:13.831 --> 47:15.354
You could own the world.

47:15.397 --> 47:16.834
Sorry?

47:16.877 --> 47:20.098
Say, "You could own the world."

47:20.141 --> 47:22.056
You could own the world.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.536
Your voice,

47:23.579 --> 47:25.799
there is something
you want to tell me.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.323
I have a strong intuition
about people.

47:28.367 --> 47:31.283
Let us not have
secrets between us.

47:31.326 --> 47:33.981
May, I want to tell you.

47:34.025 --> 47:36.331
And yet, I'’ve been so afraid.

47:36.375 --> 47:39.247
Come out and say it.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.206
It'’s my face.

47:41.249 --> 47:44.513
What about your face?

47:44.557 --> 47:48.300
If, or when, you see my face,

47:48.343 --> 47:51.651
you'’ll turn away in horror.

47:51.694 --> 47:53.218
Turn away,

47:53.261 --> 47:55.829
in horror, from you?

47:55.873 --> 47:58.092
What do you look like?

47:58.136 --> 47:59.572
I have this disease

47:59.615 --> 48:02.575
that makes my face
look mutilated.

48:02.618 --> 48:04.272
Mutated.

48:04.316 --> 48:08.929
I have this disease
that makes my face look mutated.

48:08.973 --> 48:12.106
No, I do not believe it.

48:12.150 --> 48:14.239
It'’s the truth.

48:14.282 --> 48:16.284
I'’m an outcast.

48:16.328 --> 48:17.895
It'’s just,
you'’re the first person

48:17.938 --> 48:20.941
that didn'’t scream.

48:20.985 --> 48:24.379
Perhaps my brother
can fix your face.

48:24.423 --> 48:27.948
There'’s no hope.

48:27.992 --> 48:30.429
It really does not matter
to me what you look like

48:30.472 --> 48:33.171
or if you have some
terrible disease,

48:33.214 --> 48:36.348
not now, not when I see.

48:36.391 --> 48:38.306
Who you are inside,

48:38.350 --> 48:40.569
that'’s what I see.

48:40.613 --> 48:43.703
Your heart is gentle and kind,

48:43.746 --> 48:47.011
and therefore,
you are beautiful.

48:47.054 --> 48:49.578
If others cannot see that,

48:49.622 --> 48:52.538
it is they who are blind.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.551
Action.
You'’re not doing your dance.

49:05.594 --> 49:06.508
They'’re really just children,

49:06.552 --> 49:07.988
such innocent creatures.

49:08.032 --> 49:09.163
Now show the dance.

49:10.034 --> 49:11.905
-Faster.
-Come, yes.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.341
-With the flute.
-Do not make eye contact.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.779
Then, she like doesn'’t
have the chops to pull it off.

49:16.823 --> 49:18.607
Quiet on set!

49:20.479 --> 49:24.352
My initial optimism
was premature.

49:24.396 --> 49:28.226
The organs failed 12 hours
after transplantation.

49:30.489 --> 49:33.883
I'’ve failed again.

49:41.021 --> 49:42.675
I'’m at 33?

49:42.718 --> 49:44.068
I think you'’re at 30.

49:44.111 --> 49:45.852
Tell me when I'’m at 33.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.723
Keep doing it, right there.

49:47.767 --> 49:50.813
Okay, action!

49:52.598 --> 49:54.992
All right, I'’ll yell action,

49:55.035 --> 50:01.476
and then after that
I'’ll just cue Brutto.

50:01.520 --> 50:03.478
-Uh, in a little bit?
-Yeah.

50:03.522 --> 50:04.827
Right there.

50:04.871 --> 50:07.700
All right, action!

50:07.743 --> 50:09.093
Brutto.

50:11.095 --> 50:12.966
All right, back to one.

50:16.926 --> 50:19.103
Camera, set.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.106
Brutto!

50:23.672 --> 50:25.587
Leering, yes.

50:25.631 --> 50:26.675
Back to one.

50:28.242 --> 50:30.114
I like this composition, yeah.

50:30.157 --> 50:33.073
The soul has too many windows.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.075
-Set.
-Brutto!

50:37.034 --> 50:39.688
Back to one.

50:39.732 --> 50:41.821
All right, Sarah,
turn a beat earlier,

50:41.864 --> 50:43.301
half a beat earlier.

50:43.344 --> 50:46.217
Okay.

50:46.260 --> 50:49.263
Turn your head
slightly to the right.

50:51.091 --> 50:52.788
Turn slightly to the right.

50:52.832 --> 50:55.487
Perfect.

50:55.530 --> 50:58.620
Oh, no, slightly left, yes.

50:58.664 --> 51:00.318
A little more left.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.189
Yes.

51:02.233 --> 51:04.800
Brutto.

51:04.844 --> 51:06.889
-Brutto!

51:08.761 --> 51:09.631
Back to one.

51:09.675 --> 51:11.633
We now have the power

51:11.677 --> 51:15.724
to bend nature to our will.

51:15.768 --> 51:19.424
Do we not have a responsibility,

51:19.467 --> 51:25.386
a sacred duty,
to eliminate disorder,

51:25.430 --> 51:29.303
to end aberrations?

51:29.347 --> 51:31.131
Sorry, I messed up the word,
start again.

51:31.175 --> 51:34.439
Since you'’re starting over,
just take a step to your left.

51:34.482 --> 51:35.222
Yeah.

51:35.266 --> 51:36.571
A centimeter.

51:36.615 --> 51:40.140
To end,
to eliminate disorder, to--

51:40.184 --> 51:41.054
Eradicate!

51:41.098 --> 51:42.708
Eradicate aberrations.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.797
Slumping his head.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.452
We now have the power

51:47.495 --> 51:51.456
to bend nature to our wills.

51:51.499 --> 51:55.286
Do we not have a responsibility,

51:55.329 --> 52:00.682
a sacred duty,
to eliminate disorder,

52:00.726 --> 52:04.686
to eradicate aberrations,

52:04.730 --> 52:09.300
to put an end to needless
suffering?

52:09.343 --> 52:14.870
We now have the power to
bend nature to our wills.

52:14.914 --> 52:18.178
Do we not have a responsibility,

52:18.222 --> 52:23.966
a sacred duty,
to eliminate disorder,

52:24.010 --> 52:28.319
to eradicate aberrations,

52:28.362 --> 52:31.713
to end needless suffering,

52:31.757 --> 52:32.845
to take arms--

52:32.888 --> 52:36.196
I do not know whether
he is a genius

52:36.240 --> 52:38.285
or a madman.

52:38.329 --> 52:39.895
Show them.

52:39.939 --> 52:40.983
You can do it.

52:41.027 --> 52:41.984
He'’s not an imbecile.

52:42.028 --> 52:43.334
Show them what you showed me.

52:43.377 --> 52:45.292
Don'’t be afraid.

52:45.336 --> 52:49.122
"Heard melodies are sweet,

52:49.166 --> 52:52.125
"but those unheard are sweeter.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.215
"Therefore, ye soft pipes,
play on."

52:55.259 --> 52:56.738
You practiced with him!

52:56.782 --> 52:58.305
He'’s just repeating by rote.

52:58.349 --> 52:59.698
He doesn'’t understand
the meaning

52:59.741 --> 53:01.526
of what he'’s saying.

53:01.569 --> 53:02.483
No!

53:02.527 --> 53:05.138
You said you'’d help me, doctor.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.095
In time.

53:06.139 --> 53:07.836
I have done much for you,

53:07.880 --> 53:09.795
things that have made me
ashamed.

53:09.838 --> 53:11.884
But I acted in desperation,

53:11.927 --> 53:15.409
'’cause you promised me
a new face, a new life!

53:15.453 --> 53:17.629
Though I'’m starting to
suspect you might not be

53:17.672 --> 53:21.328
as sincere about holding
up your end of the bargain.

53:31.425 --> 53:33.253
I'’ve done it, my dear,

53:33.297 --> 53:35.386
just as I promised.

53:35.429 --> 53:39.041
The operation
was a complete success.

53:39.085 --> 53:40.434
Is it really true?

53:40.478 --> 53:42.219
A medical breakthrough.

53:42.262 --> 53:44.873
Shh, sleep some more.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.658
You need rest.

53:46.701 --> 53:49.226
When you wake up,

53:49.269 --> 53:52.098
a new life will begin.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.457
No one must ever know

54:03.501 --> 54:05.329
that you are my...

54:05.372 --> 54:06.286
One more time.

54:06.330 --> 54:08.070
I almost said "son."

54:14.425 --> 54:17.079
No one must ever know

54:17.123 --> 54:19.560
that you are my brother.

54:32.356 --> 54:36.055
Who'’s there?

54:36.098 --> 54:38.884
Come closer.

54:38.927 --> 54:40.102
Let me see.

55:04.605 --> 55:06.607
We begin by registering
all people--

55:09.393 --> 55:11.090
...be it physical, ethnic...

55:11.133 --> 55:12.613
Get them away from me.

55:12.657 --> 55:14.136
Freida, why aren'’t you in...

55:17.705 --> 55:20.360
How did you...

55:20.404 --> 55:24.103
All of you, leave, at once!

55:27.019 --> 55:29.978
Rosenthal.

55:30.022 --> 55:31.328
I knew I could never...

55:31.371 --> 55:35.723
You said you'’d help me,
Dr. Otternschlag.

55:35.767 --> 55:37.246
Stop him.

55:37.290 --> 55:39.031
He'’s against all of you.

55:39.074 --> 55:41.947
We'’re all the same here, doctor.

55:41.990 --> 55:46.517
Freida,
I thought you were one of us.

55:46.560 --> 55:50.085
Please, spare me.

55:50.129 --> 55:52.523
I can fix all of you.

55:52.566 --> 55:55.830
You can lead normal lives.

55:55.874 --> 55:57.658
I can set you free.

55:57.702 --> 56:01.358
All my knowledge, the success
I'’ve had with Freida,

56:01.401 --> 56:03.272
let me do the same with you.

56:03.316 --> 56:05.840
I'’m your only hope.

56:05.884 --> 56:07.625
Nice try, doctor.

56:15.589 --> 56:18.418
Oh God!

56:22.204 --> 56:24.468
Freida.

56:24.511 --> 56:27.601
Brother!

56:27.645 --> 56:30.909
No, stay away from me!

56:30.952 --> 56:32.389
Stay away!

56:32.432 --> 56:34.391
You'’re a monster.

56:34.434 --> 56:36.436
Look, Freida, behind you!

57:08.729 --> 57:10.557
My face.

57:10.601 --> 57:13.212
My face.

57:19.523 --> 57:22.308
I wouldn'’t want to sleep there.

57:22.351 --> 57:26.312
I'’d give a million dollars
to know what goes on in there.

57:33.145 --> 57:34.233
It'’s a visual medium,

57:34.276 --> 57:36.931
so it serves
as a kind of shorthand.

57:36.975 --> 57:40.457
A defect of the body
is kind of ocular metaphor

57:40.500 --> 57:42.981
for defect of the soul.

57:43.024 --> 57:45.026
Look, Quasimodo, Achilles,

57:45.070 --> 57:48.465
Richard III, Bloster,
Goliath, Tom Thumb,

57:48.508 --> 57:52.381
Captain Hook, Caliban,
Krueger, Frankenstein,

57:52.425 --> 57:54.296
all bitter defectives.

57:54.340 --> 57:56.124
It'’s such a gamble when you get
a face. Who said that?

57:56.168 --> 57:57.561
And the chariot is the vehicle

57:57.604 --> 57:59.824
that drives all of that.

57:59.867 --> 58:03.044
The empress and the emperor
are overseeing this.

58:03.088 --> 58:05.525
Man, how do you do that?

58:05.569 --> 58:06.526
It'’s not him.

58:06.570 --> 58:08.397
-It'’s the cards.
-Wow.

58:08.441 --> 58:10.443
How prophetic.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.836
-Nina!
-Nora.

58:11.879 --> 58:14.534
Nora, you have to have
Aristotle do your reading.

58:14.578 --> 58:16.710
I don'’t believe in
that stuff, no offense.

58:16.754 --> 58:20.192
Oh, I don'’t usually, but wow.

58:20.235 --> 58:22.847
Maybe she doesn'’t want to know.

58:22.890 --> 58:24.109
What time is it?

58:24.152 --> 58:25.980
Some godforsaken hour.

58:26.024 --> 58:27.373
Oh, fuck.

58:27.416 --> 58:29.418
I got to go learn
my goddamned lines.

58:29.462 --> 58:31.551
But trust me, this guy,

58:31.595 --> 58:33.553
got a gift.

58:45.130 --> 58:47.915
Hey, Brutto.
What are you doing with that?

58:47.959 --> 58:49.656
What does it look
like I'’m doing?

58:49.700 --> 58:50.875
That'’s not our camera.

58:50.918 --> 58:52.050
They want us guarding
the equipment.

58:52.093 --> 58:54.269
That is implicit permission
to use it.

58:54.313 --> 58:55.575
Yeah.

58:55.619 --> 58:56.837
Let'’s make a movie.

58:56.881 --> 58:58.926
I have to memorize my lines.

58:58.970 --> 59:02.060
I'’m not gonna be
blamed if you break that.

59:02.103 --> 59:03.322
Anybody can use this.

59:03.365 --> 59:04.453
It'’s digital.

59:04.497 --> 59:06.673
I encourage this behavior.

59:06.717 --> 59:07.848
Does she agree?

59:07.892 --> 59:09.502
No, actually, I don'’t.

59:09.546 --> 59:10.808
So you'’re the evil one.

59:10.851 --> 59:12.592
I think that makes me
the evil one.

59:12.636 --> 59:13.985
You'’re on the right.

59:14.028 --> 59:16.291
Left is the sinister one.
Don'’t you know that?

59:16.335 --> 59:17.858
It'’s been years since
somebody told me that.

59:17.902 --> 59:19.033
You girls ever acted before?

59:19.077 --> 59:22.080
Oh my God,
do you guys never sleep?

59:22.123 --> 59:24.604
I'’d stop messing around
with that camera if I were you.

59:24.648 --> 59:26.345
I think we'’re being watched.

59:26.388 --> 59:28.477
Why are you so paranoid?

59:32.569 --> 59:34.092
We heard they were
filming a movie in here.

59:34.135 --> 59:35.223
Yeah, we'’re
just getting started.

59:35.267 --> 59:36.355
You want to be in a movie?

59:36.398 --> 59:39.097
It doesn'’t look like a movie.

59:39.140 --> 59:41.012
-Let me tell you a story.
-No.

59:41.055 --> 59:42.927
Just listen.

59:42.970 --> 59:44.232
In the days of the Black Death--

59:44.276 --> 59:45.146
I don'’t care.

59:45.190 --> 59:46.844
I need to go.

59:46.887 --> 59:48.628
How many men
have you made love to?

59:48.672 --> 59:50.282
Nobody, you know that.

59:50.325 --> 59:51.588
How could I know that?

59:51.631 --> 59:53.415
I mean, I can only hope.

59:53.459 --> 59:54.765
So you'’ve never had a boyfriend?

59:54.808 --> 59:56.854
-No.
-I'’m gonna be the first.

59:56.897 --> 59:58.551
No, you won'’t.

59:58.595 --> 59:59.944
I know that.

59:59.987 --> 01:00:02.033
How could I not know that?

01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:03.904
But let me tell you something.

01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:07.386
When you do finally
make love to a man,

01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:10.345
no matter who it is,
if it isn'’t me,

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:11.825
I don'’t know what I'll do.

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:13.479
You won'’t do anything.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:15.655
I'’ll kill myself.

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.135
A Family in Need is on.

01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:18.266
I have to go.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.225
A what is on?

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:21.922
Oh God, you'’re so out of touch.

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:22.880
Oh come on!

01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:24.533
Don'’t think I don't get it.

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:26.405
There'’s some actor
on a show, right,

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:27.928
some hot actor.

01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:30.844
I mean, I just don'’t
understand you sometimes.

01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:32.585
I thought you were
the literary type.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.936
Turns out, you'’re just
a child of television.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.331
No wonder you can'’t communicate
properly with people.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:41.942
I think you need to grow up!

01:00:41.986 --> 01:00:44.031
No, I don'’t need
to take this from you.

01:00:44.075 --> 01:00:46.904
You have no idea how to
interact with people.

01:00:46.947 --> 01:00:50.081
All you do is yell and act
bitter because you'’re deformed.

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:52.474
-Oh, so you admit it now!
-No, I didn'’t say that.

01:00:52.518 --> 01:00:53.824
You were the one that
said you were deformed.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.042
Oh bullshit!

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:57.697
Why can'’t we just
do something fun?

01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:00.091
-This is fun.
-This is not fun.

01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:01.875
Well, if you just relax!

01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:03.790
You may like
it'’s a massive burden

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.096
spending time with me.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.794
I mean, what the fuck
else do you have to do,

01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:10.884
apart from go home
and watch television?

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:14.801
Smile, be happy, here, now.

01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:17.325
I am fantastic company!

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:21.721
I am happy, okay, see?

01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:23.549
I like you fine.

01:01:23.592 --> 01:01:26.378
I'’m just not attracted to you.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:28.162
I'’m sorry.

01:01:30.251 --> 01:01:32.689
All you do is talk about us

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:36.170
and ask me why our
relationship is this way

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:37.606
and why it can'’t be that way,

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.740
and it makes me uncomfortable.

01:01:40.784 --> 01:01:42.742
People don'’t talk this way
to each other.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.265
People certainly
don'’t threaten suicide

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.050
in the middle of a conversation.

01:01:46.093 --> 01:01:48.313
You don'’t talk this way
to other people.

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:52.056
You don'’t talk this way
to Louis.

01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:54.972
I don'’t know
how to react to you,

01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:58.627
other than to fall in love
with you.

01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:01.065
But I can'’t.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.154
I won'’t.

01:02:03.197 --> 01:02:05.765
I wouldn'’t want to.

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:09.856
I just think you need
to lower your standards.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:13.773
Well, whatever happens, happens.

01:02:15.688 --> 01:02:18.822
Maybe I'’ll end up
falling in love with you.

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:23.348
Let'’s go see a movie.

01:02:23.391 --> 01:02:24.958
A Family in Need is on,

01:02:25.002 --> 01:02:26.655
and it'’s a
really important episode.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:27.569
I can'’t miss it.

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:29.049
I told you that already.

01:02:29.093 --> 01:02:30.050
Okay, we'’ll go.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.270
We'’ll watch it.

01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:35.360
Well, I'’m
watching it with my sister.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.057
You know, last night,

01:02:37.101 --> 01:02:39.494
I had the most
unsettling nightmare.

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:44.021
-Tell me.
-I was in this hospital.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:48.068
And then we cut directly
into the dream, right there.

01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.243
Who wrote this?

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:51.593
-Brutto did.
-Man.

01:02:51.637 --> 01:02:54.161
-You don'’t like it?
-I like it.

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:56.207
Doorways, I have to duck.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.733
Ceiling fans, chairs,
transportation,

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.955
like, you know,
cars, airplanes, you?

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:09.046
Countertops...

01:03:15.487 --> 01:03:17.445
How much do you think
this hospital costs?

01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:19.273
How would I know?

01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:22.102
Nurse, how much
does the hospital cost?

01:03:22.146 --> 01:03:23.364
An arm and a leg.

01:03:23.408 --> 01:03:25.062
I wonder if they take insurance.

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:27.499
Brutto,
you'’ve had surgery, right?

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:28.892
Yeah, of course.

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:30.154
Like a lot of surgery?

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.939
Yeah, I mean, yeah, so?

01:03:32.983 --> 01:03:34.506
Okay, do you not want
to talk about it?

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:36.725
I'’ll talk about it,
but why are you asking?

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:39.250
I mean, I mean,
I'’ll tell you about my surgery.

01:03:39.293 --> 01:03:40.860
Nina, you'’ve had surgery, right?

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.122
My name'’s Nora.

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:43.515
Nora, I apologize.

01:03:43.558 --> 01:03:45.299
But how much surgery
have you had?

01:03:45.343 --> 01:03:46.648
It depends.

01:03:46.692 --> 01:03:49.608
-On what?
-On what you call surgery.

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.175
Well, I don'’t
mean getting a tattoo.

01:03:51.218 --> 01:03:52.132
Let'’s put it that way.

01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:53.264
A lot then.

01:03:53.307 --> 01:03:54.439
Who do you think has had more,

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:56.049
you or Brutto?

01:03:56.093 --> 01:03:57.616
I had some.

01:03:57.659 --> 01:03:59.748
Ah, and did your insurance
cover it?

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:02.012
-Some of it.
-I don'’t have insurance.

01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:03.361
Are you serious?

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:05.058
I can'’t afford it, so what?

01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:06.451
I tore a ligament in my knee,

01:04:06.494 --> 01:04:08.453
and I had to wear a cast
for a year.

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.934
-Interesting.
-Is that not legitimate?

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.892
Oh no, I'’m not saying
that it'’s not legitimate.

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:15.068
I'’m just commiserating with you.

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.200
Okay then.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:18.071
Gee, now I feel left out.

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:19.899
-Be glad about that.
-Definitely.

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:20.987
You don'’t need to feel left out.

01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:22.467
You'’ve witnessed surgery.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.425
Yeah, like it'’s the same thing?

01:04:24.469 --> 01:04:26.688
Oh no, no,
I know it'’s not the same,

01:04:26.732 --> 01:04:30.083
but yes, I'’ve seen a lot,
and it'’s affected me.

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:32.781
And you'’re helping people,
which is great.

01:04:32.825 --> 01:04:34.609
I get emotionally attached.

01:04:34.653 --> 01:04:36.873
To the breast implant patients?

01:04:36.916 --> 01:04:38.222
People die here.

01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.353
Of malpractice, maybe.

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:41.312
That'’s one reason.

01:04:41.355 --> 01:04:42.704
I was joking.

01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:43.923
Not malpractice

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.230
but all medical procedures
carry risks,

01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:49.276
so percentage-wise,
some people do die.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.149
It'’s not necessarily a result
of malpractice.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.325
Some people don'’t tolerate
anesthesia, for instance.

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.153
But they need those breasts.

01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:58.633
They'’re willing to die
for those breasts.

01:04:58.677 --> 01:05:00.157
You guys make it sound
so trivial,

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.855
but if a woman needs bigger
breasts to feel confident

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.074
and we live in a society

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.597
that favors larger-chested
women,

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.512
how can you fault them for that?

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.470
Look at your face.
You weren'’t born like that.

01:05:09.514 --> 01:05:10.689
You had corrective surgery

01:05:10.732 --> 01:05:12.647
that wasn'’t medically necessary.

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.214
I was an infant at the time.

01:05:14.258 --> 01:05:17.261
I didn'’t consent
to any reconstructive surgery.

01:05:17.304 --> 01:05:18.915
Yeah, but your parents,
or whoever,

01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:22.309
they took a risk, so you could
fit better into society.

01:05:22.353 --> 01:05:24.703
What do you know about
how I fit into society?

01:05:24.746 --> 01:05:27.140
I'’m on your side. I'm just
defending breast implants

01:05:27.184 --> 01:05:28.794
and saying that some people
think it'’s necessary,

01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:29.882
and the risk
is worth the reward.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.624
Yeah, but you act like everybody

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:34.060
that goes in there, dies.

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:35.670
That'’s absolutely
not what I'’m implying.

01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:37.585
We literally have the
best doctors in the world.

01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:38.935
Dr. Godwin, right?

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:41.024
Goodrich,
Dr. Goodrich is the best.

01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:42.590
For what he does, he'’s the best.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:45.158
People come from literally
all over the world to see him.

01:05:45.202 --> 01:05:47.769
-What'’s so great about him?
-He'’s really good.

01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:49.293
He'’s pioneered all sorts
of procedures.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:50.685
Look him up online.

01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:51.860
- Maybe I should go see him.

01:05:51.904 --> 01:05:53.601
Oh, he'’s booked years
in advance.

01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:54.994
-Years?
-Mm-hmm.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.169
-Rosenthal?

01:05:56.213 --> 01:05:58.824
-What is happening?
-Rosenthal?

01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:02.784
Nurse, both of you,
come on, do something.

01:06:02.828 --> 01:06:05.178
-I, I don'’t know.
-I don'’t know what to do.

01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:06.527
-Has this happened before?

01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:08.051
-Someone call a doctor!

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:11.924
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.578
Okay, cut.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.146
That was fun.

01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:19.018
Okay, guys, please don'’t
make me do that again.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.237
I'’m sorry, everybody.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.760
I think we should try it
one more time.

01:06:21.803 --> 01:06:23.240
-What was wrong with it?

01:06:23.283 --> 01:06:25.329
It didn'’t feel real.

01:06:25.372 --> 01:06:28.462
Brutto, you were too aggressive.

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:30.029
That'’s the way it was written.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:33.032
Well, let'’s just try
to soften it a bit.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:35.643
Okay, coughing for real now.

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:37.080
-I'’m not doing it again.

01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.865
You sound just like
your character.

01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:42.781
Rosenthal, you write one.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:45.131
-Nah, I'’m good.
-Why not?

01:06:45.175 --> 01:06:47.046
It can be anything,

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:50.571
something that you could
never be in the real life.

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:53.400
Well, I'’ve always wanted
to be a waiter.

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:56.186
-To play one?
-No, to actually be one.

01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:57.491
That'’s never gonna happen.

01:06:57.535 --> 01:07:00.320
Oh I know,
but it would be great.

01:07:00.364 --> 01:07:03.671
Tell us about it, Rosenthal.

01:07:03.715 --> 01:07:06.152
So there I am,
the hustle and bustle

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:10.200
of the restaurant,
waiter'’s uniform.

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:12.028
I go up to a group of customers.

01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:13.855
They'’re in a booth
in the corner.

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:17.468
And I say to them,
"Good evening, how are you?"

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:19.818
And they reply,
"Fine, thank you.

01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:21.646
"How are you?"

01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:23.387
"Well, it'’s a bit busy.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.866
"But I can'’t complain.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.173
"We have some specials
on the menu tonight.

01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:28.653
"Would you like to see them?"

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:31.917
They reply, "Yes, we would."

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.875
The exchange continues
as you think it would,

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:35.964
till finally we get to the point

01:07:36.008 --> 01:07:39.881
where I say,
"Are we ready to order?"

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:42.145
One of the girls pipes up
and says,

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:45.452
"I'’ll have the tuna melt
and a Diet Coke."

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:48.064
You'’re working at a diner?

01:07:48.107 --> 01:07:52.503
Okay, one of the
girls pipes up and says,

01:07:52.546 --> 01:07:55.114
"I'’ll have the Dover sole,
please."

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.857
Dover sole and a Diet Coke?

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.946
One of the girls
pipes up and says,

01:08:00.989 --> 01:08:04.819
"I'’ll have the Dover sole and
a glass of red wine, please."

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:07.039
Fish and red wine?

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:08.606
Why is everyone looking at me?

01:08:08.649 --> 01:08:10.042
I don'’t even like movies.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.391
Someone else write one.

01:08:11.435 --> 01:08:13.001
I'’ve got to learn
my goddamned lines

01:08:13.045 --> 01:08:14.699
and take my goddamned
medication.

01:08:14.742 --> 01:08:16.091
I'’m done with this.

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:17.702
I have a movie.

01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.225
I'’m gonna go to bed.

01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:21.314
I'’ve got to
learn my goddamned lines.

01:08:21.358 --> 01:08:23.707
Oh great, now a woman
wants to make a movie,

01:08:23.751 --> 01:08:25.013
and nobody wants to help.

01:08:25.057 --> 01:08:26.363
Hey, I made one.

01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:27.755
I'’ll help you.

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:30.193
Maybe it'’s too ambitious
for tonight anyways.

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:32.542
No, tell us about it.

01:08:32.586 --> 01:08:35.720
Okay, well...

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:08.578
My face.

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.152
Real acid.

01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:19.328
Who did this?

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:24.072
Hi, Mabel.

01:09:24.116 --> 01:09:26.249
It'’s great to see you again.

01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:38.870
Comfy?

01:09:38.912 --> 01:09:41.002
All right, turn to me.

01:09:43.917 --> 01:09:46.006
Okay.

01:09:46.051 --> 01:09:48.618
This is Lisa.
She'’s a medical student.

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:52.404
I hope you don'’t mind if she
observes our exam, today.

01:09:52.448 --> 01:09:53.928
That'’s fine.

01:09:53.971 --> 01:09:57.541
So, Lisa, this is a
very interesting case.

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:59.978
Why don'’t you present her to me?

01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:05.853
Um, ,
this is Mabel Fairchild.

01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:08.247
She'’s a 30-year-old,
white female

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:11.294
who originally presented
to Trinity Hospital in 2017

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:14.384
with third-degree
chemical burns resulting

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:18.257
from an accident on a movie set.

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.390
They affected 20% of her body,

01:10:20.433 --> 01:10:22.566
including her head,
oral mucosa, neck,

01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.524
and left-upper extremity.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.831
In the ED, she was
found to be hypotensive,

01:10:26.874 --> 01:10:29.703
was fluid resuscitated
and then admitted to the ICU

01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:31.879
and was ultimately
transferred to Mount Sinai,

01:10:31.923 --> 01:10:33.881
where there'’s a burn unit.

01:10:33.925 --> 01:10:36.797
Good, continue.

01:10:36.841 --> 01:10:40.192
-She also--
-You'’re doing great.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.282
She also had a
bout of acute renal failure,

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:46.242
presumably due to ATN from
her hypotensive episode,

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:48.461
but that is now resolved.

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.115
Surgery plastics
and ophthalmology

01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:51.943
were all following.

01:10:51.986 --> 01:10:54.337
She had a flap procedure
to reconstruct part

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.773
of her nose
and left buckle area,

01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:58.254
which she seems to have
tolerated pretty well.

01:10:58.297 --> 01:10:59.994
Overall, she spent a month
in the hospital

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:02.867
and now presents
for routine follow-up.

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:05.217
The only thing of note
is that she appears

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:08.307
to have started smoking again,
up to 1/2 pack a day,

01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:12.964
and her alcohol intake is
up to five or more glasses

01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:16.315
of wine a week, which
makes me a little concerned

01:11:16.359 --> 01:11:17.664
about whether there'’s

01:11:17.708 --> 01:11:19.623
a substance-related
issue going on.

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:21.277
Hmm.

01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:43.821
Can you actually
make that two, on me?

01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:49.000
You'’re not drinking alone,
are you?

01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:55.615
Here you go.

01:11:55.659 --> 01:11:57.182
Keep it.

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.449
Has anyone ever done
anything nice for you before?

01:12:03.493 --> 01:12:04.929
What do you want?

01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:07.018
I just want to
buy a girl a drink.

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:08.846
You just say thank you.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:15.069
Man, you try and do
something nice for someone.

01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:16.375
Cheer up.

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:21.249
Come meet my friends.

01:12:21.293 --> 01:12:23.513
-Just say it.
-Say what?

01:12:23.556 --> 01:12:25.732
Say what you want to say!

01:12:25.776 --> 01:12:28.387
What do I want to say?

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:31.172
Jesus, you'’re paranoid.

01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:33.653
Ice fucking cold.

01:12:39.529 --> 01:12:41.095
If you don'’t want
to deal with people,

01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:43.184
maybe you shouldn'’t
fucking go out in public.

01:12:43.228 --> 01:12:45.752
Keep the drink.
You look like you need it.

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:05.468
Hi, how are you?

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.469
Fine.

01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:09.950
Are you ready to order?

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:13.519
Yeah, tuna melt
and a Diet Coke, please.

01:13:13.563 --> 01:13:15.347
Don'’t be frightened.

01:13:17.436 --> 01:13:19.220
Sorry, do I know you?

01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:21.048
You don'’t recognize me?

01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:25.488
Rosenthal!

01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:27.054
No, it can'’t be.

01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:30.754
What, what happened?

01:13:30.797 --> 01:13:34.627
Hard to believe, isn'’t it?

01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:38.457
It'’s impossible.

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:40.154
How?

01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:42.505
Goodrich, you remember,

01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:45.072
the doctor from the hospital
where we shot The Undesirables

01:13:45.116 --> 01:13:48.554
or Marked for Life,
as it was called then.

01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:50.774
Goodrich fixed all of us,

01:13:50.817 --> 01:13:55.474
Phrosa, the twins, Aristotle.
He saved us.

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.041
I could never imagine.

01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:59.260
People get used to anything.

01:13:59.304 --> 01:14:02.699
But after a while,
it just felt normal.

01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:06.354
But now that I'’m free,

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:08.748
I have my dream job.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:12.448
And I can'’t wait
for you to meet Lily.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:13.623
Your wife?

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:15.668
My dog.

01:14:15.712 --> 01:14:18.497
Dog'’s love me now,
and I love dogs.

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:20.586
You need to have the procedure.

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:23.328
Feel my skin.

01:14:23.371 --> 01:14:28.202
It'’s real flesh, made from
stem cells or something.

01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:29.508
He knows what happened to you,

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:31.292
and he wants to help.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:33.817
Oh, I'’ve seen so many doctors.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.514
But he'’s not a doctor.

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:37.603
He'’s a miracle worker.

01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:40.388
I'’m living proof.

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:43.043
Do it, while you'’re still young.

01:14:43.087 --> 01:14:45.176
It'’s too late for me.

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:47.961
Five years is nothing.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:50.660
You could even
have your career back.

01:14:50.703 --> 01:14:53.576
-I'’m too old.
-Or who knows?

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:57.449
There'’s loads of good roles
in television, I hear.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.147
Anyway, it'’s never
too late to be happy.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:01.888
You'’d be crazy to refuse.

01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:06.066
Why suffer, for what?

01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:07.851
For nothing.

01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:09.548
Go to him.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:10.810
We can be together, Mabel.

01:15:10.854 --> 01:15:13.378
I'’m so happy, I can't tell you.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:38.708
Rosenthal.

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.492
It'’s you.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.146
I don'’t want to disturb you.

01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:43.843
No, don'’t go, though.

01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:46.063
Stay with me.

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:58.989
No, please, don'’t.

01:15:59.032 --> 01:16:00.512
Why?

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.645
You don'’t have to be afraid.

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:20.227
I think you'’re beautiful.

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:22.578
Me, beautiful?

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:28.018
Especially your eyes.

01:16:28.061 --> 01:16:31.369
You have such beautiful eyes.

01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:15.299
Why are you so kind to me?

01:18:20.173 --> 01:18:21.392
Cut.

01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:26.136
She didn'’t do the German accent.

01:18:26.179 --> 01:18:29.008
What more can I do?

01:18:29.052 --> 01:18:30.488
Another take.

01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:35.580
No, I'’ve done everything.

01:18:35.623 --> 01:18:38.191
Now I must wash
my hands of this.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:42.761
We tell ourselves
stories in order

01:18:42.805 --> 01:18:44.415
so that we might live.

01:18:44.458 --> 01:18:45.808
Man has been telling
himself stories

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:47.679
since the time of
his earliest ancestors.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.508
It'’s an innate,
human impulse, you know,

01:18:50.551 --> 01:18:52.597
the longing for, for order,

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:55.992
for symmetry,
for, you know, for beauty.

01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:57.471
Right, right.

01:18:57.515 --> 01:19:00.431
So a good story
satisfies that longing,

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:01.562
like a three-act structure.

01:19:01.606 --> 01:19:03.129
That'’s like an attractive woman

01:19:03.173 --> 01:19:07.786
or, God, you know, ideal,
but an attainable one.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.309
Yeah, but if everything
were ideal,

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:12.269
then nothing would be ideal.

01:19:14.445 --> 01:19:17.230
That'’s why I like you,
bright boy.

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.328
The car'’s here
whenever you'’re ready.

01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:29.416
Hey.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:30.809
Hi, before you go,

01:19:30.853 --> 01:19:32.724
I wanted to give you this

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.813
from my secret stash.

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:35.683
What is it?

01:19:35.727 --> 01:19:37.685
Dr. Lichter'’s Magic Cream.

01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:39.470
Ah, the anti-laughing cream.

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:41.080
-Mm-hmm.
-I'’ll try not to smile.

01:19:41.124 --> 01:19:42.908
I believe in you.

01:19:42.952 --> 01:19:44.170
You know Dr. Lichter?

01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:45.519
Oh yeah, he lives
in my mom'’s building.

01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:46.869
You know him, too?

01:19:46.912 --> 01:19:49.393
Yeah, he'’s, um,
a friend of my agent.

01:19:49.436 --> 01:19:50.263
What is this stuff?

01:19:50.307 --> 01:19:51.874
Oh, it'’s nothing. It's--

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:53.397
-For girls.
-It'’s for girls.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.964
-Well, then.
-Yeah.

01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:56.835
Dr. Lichter is really a genius.

01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:58.663
- Mad genius.
-Uh-huh.

01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:00.360
God, I feel left out
not knowing this guy.

01:20:00.404 --> 01:20:02.406
We'’ll hook you up, one of us.

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:04.625
Right, one of us.

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:09.239
-Sarah.
-Mm-hmm.

01:20:09.282 --> 01:20:11.850
If you don'’t mind,

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:15.288
I'’d like to talk to Mabel alone.

01:20:15.332 --> 01:20:17.813
Oh, I, uh, um, sure.

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:28.649
What'’s this about
anti-laughing cream?

01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:31.304
Uh, it'’s just a joke.

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:39.008
"Laughter is never
very far from derision."

01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:41.880
Who said that?

01:20:41.924 --> 01:20:44.578
I have no idea.

01:20:44.622 --> 01:20:47.843
Well, it'’s impressive...Latin.

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:49.453
Dead language.

01:20:49.496 --> 01:20:51.107
You'’re keeping it alive.

01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:52.673
One day, it'’ll be gone.

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:53.936
Well, not you,

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.589
you'’re immortalized
on celluloid.

01:20:55.633 --> 01:20:59.550
Another dead language.

01:20:59.593 --> 01:21:01.857
You wanted to talk
about something.

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:06.600
Yes, well, no,
I just, ,

01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:11.823
well, Mabel, I wanted to say...

01:21:17.307 --> 01:21:20.005
...it'’s been a pleasure
working with you.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:33.383
Hello, madam.

01:22:33.426 --> 01:22:34.906
Hi.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:37.561
Are we having a good day?

01:22:37.604 --> 01:22:39.476
Pretty good.
How'’s your day?

01:22:39.519 --> 01:22:42.218
Very good.
Thank you for asking.

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:44.655
We are going to the airport,
yes?

01:22:44.698 --> 01:22:48.180
Yeah.

01:22:48.224 --> 01:22:50.661
You are an actress?

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:51.923
I am.

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.230
You are very beautiful.

01:22:54.273 --> 01:22:56.275
Thank you.

01:22:59.409 --> 01:23:03.935
Uh, shouldn'’t
we have turned left?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.197
Ah, yes, madam,

01:23:05.241 --> 01:23:07.373
but the road is closed that way.

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:08.592
They found a dead man.

01:23:08.635 --> 01:23:10.202
There'’s no way through.

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:11.899
Police close it.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:16.078
The killer.

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.210
I love movies.

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:20.560
I see every movie ever made.

01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:24.216
-You know Indiana Jones?
-Yeah.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:28.090
That is
the best movie ever made.

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:30.048
You and me are the same.

01:23:30.092 --> 01:23:32.311
We are both artists.

01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:33.878
You'’re an artist?

01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:37.055
Yes, madam,
I am many, many things.

01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:40.841
Here, this is my book.

01:23:40.885 --> 01:23:42.321
Um...

01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:46.325
You wrote this?

01:23:46.369 --> 01:23:47.979
Yes, madam.

01:23:50.373 --> 01:23:52.897
What is it?
I can'’t read the language.

01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.074
It is a story of
how I escaped my country.

01:23:56.118 --> 01:23:57.641
What'’s your country?

01:23:57.684 --> 01:23:59.382
I am from Nigeria.

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:01.688
You know Nigeria?

01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:02.559
Africa.

01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:04.865
Africa, that is right.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.047
My wife and children
are there still.

01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:14.223
God, I'’m sorry.

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:17.835
But God has a plan.

01:24:17.878 --> 01:24:20.881
Yeah, he does.

01:24:20.925 --> 01:24:24.059
This is a book I write
about my experience.

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:25.930
I would next like
to make a movie of it.

01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:27.627
It'’ll make a very,
very good movie,

01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:30.239
because there'’s a lot of action.

01:24:30.282 --> 01:24:32.284
Who would you have play you?

01:24:32.328 --> 01:24:34.025
I will play myself.

01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:37.376
But if Hollywood wants
to make this movie then,

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.249
maybe we get Denzel Washington

01:24:40.292 --> 01:24:46.516
or Daniel Day-Lewis,
oh, phenomenal actor.

01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:48.126
Well, you should have
someone translate your book,

01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.606
so I can read it.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:50.998
I translated it.

01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:54.219
You can download it
on Amazon.com.

01:24:54.263 --> 01:24:55.742
I'’ll download it
when I get home.

01:24:55.786 --> 01:24:58.049
What is the title?

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.486
Title is hard to translate.

01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.315
It means like, My Sad Tale,

01:25:03.359 --> 01:25:05.491
but I call it My Struggle,

01:25:05.535 --> 01:25:09.539
because this sound
more commercial.

01:25:09.582 --> 01:25:12.890
If you like it, please
give five-star review.

01:25:12.933 --> 01:25:14.413
And when I make this movie,

01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:16.807
you can be in the movie, too!

01:25:19.505 --> 01:25:21.725
Yeah.

01:25:21.768 --> 01:25:24.467
God, wow, that'’s incredible

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:28.732
that you escaped,
and you'’re a limo driver

01:25:28.775 --> 01:25:31.996
and a published author.

01:25:32.039 --> 01:25:36.174
Yes. I know nine languages.

01:25:36.218 --> 01:25:38.045
Wow.

01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:40.874
I am also a math wizard.

01:25:40.918 --> 01:25:41.701
Math?

01:25:41.745 --> 01:25:43.312
Yes.

01:25:43.355 --> 01:25:45.488
Let me demonstrate.

01:25:45.531 --> 01:25:47.490
Ask me to multiply something.

01:25:49.448 --> 01:25:51.755
Uh, uh--

01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:55.802
Give me two numbers,
and I'’ll multiply them.

01:25:55.846 --> 01:25:57.674
I don'’t know.
I can'’t think of any.

01:25:57.717 --> 01:26:02.592
You cannot
think of two numbers?

01:26:02.635 --> 01:26:04.985
Six and 20?

01:26:05.029 --> 01:26:07.423
No, madam, that is too easy.

01:26:07.466 --> 01:26:11.775
Much harder,
give me much harder.

01:26:11.818 --> 01:26:20.566
642 times 9,060.

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:26.137
642 times 9,060 is, uh,

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:32.839
5,816,520.

01:26:32.883 --> 01:26:34.319
Wow.

01:26:34.363 --> 01:26:36.539
Look it up
on your mobile phone.

01:26:36.582 --> 01:26:40.151
Oh, uh, say that again.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:46.723
5,816,520.

01:26:46.766 --> 01:26:48.681
That'’s insane.

01:26:48.725 --> 01:26:51.206
How did--how did you do that?

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:54.948
I am a math wizard.

01:26:54.992 --> 01:26:58.300
No, that'’s impossible.

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:01.651
God, what else are you
freakishly good at?

01:27:01.694 --> 01:27:03.653
I make a TV show.

01:27:03.696 --> 01:27:08.614
See this here?

01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:10.268
Is that a camera?

01:27:10.312 --> 01:27:13.924
Yes, I film my passengers.

01:27:13.967 --> 01:27:15.142
Are you filming now?

01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:16.579
Oh no, no, no.

01:27:16.622 --> 01:27:19.799
I always ask for permission
before I film.

01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:23.107
I am very smart, and I do
not want to get sued.

01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:27.503
So I always ask for verbal
consent without fail.

01:27:27.546 --> 01:27:30.854
Will you consent?

01:27:30.897 --> 01:27:33.335
What is it for?

01:27:33.378 --> 01:27:36.381
I film my passengers
answering math problems,

01:27:36.425 --> 01:27:40.342
and I want to make a TV show
to help children learn math.

01:27:40.385 --> 01:27:42.779
Oh.

01:27:42.822 --> 01:27:45.869
But I'’m terrible at math.

01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:49.786
I mean, I--
I'’d seem like an idiot.

01:27:49.829 --> 01:27:53.572
I know a special way
to teach math.

01:27:53.616 --> 01:27:56.314
Look, right now,
this is only a dream.

01:27:56.358 --> 01:27:59.274
But I will edit the show,
put it on YouTube,

01:27:59.317 --> 01:28:01.319
and then it will
get very popular.

01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:04.453
And then I get famous enough
to ask President Trump

01:28:04.496 --> 01:28:08.283
to bring my family from Nigeria.

01:28:08.326 --> 01:28:11.460
And he will do as I ask.

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:16.291
You'’re an extraordinary man.

01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:23.254
Will you consent to film?

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:24.690
I leave it in your hands,

01:28:24.734 --> 01:28:29.608
but I will be very grateful
if you would allow it.

01:28:29.652 --> 01:28:32.176
