No.

tried to shoot down
a hot air balloon.

They got it on fire,
then it drifted out of sight.

What's with the tiny suit?
Well, a few years back,

00:15.283 --> 00:18.752
I used to think it was funny
to get drunk and pull wigs
off old ladies' heads.

Anyway,
I was at the beauty parlor
making up for it,

and one of the old ladies
was so grateful,

00:27.361 --> 00:29.797
she gave me
her dead husband's
best suit as a thank-you.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.434
- I think it's too small.
- But she said he was my size
before he started shrinking.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.470
I figure, in 40 years,
it'll fit perfect.

You always get a good feeling
from what you do-- or a suit.

I spent my morning
sweeping up bullet casings
and a variety of fancy cheeses.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.481
- Fancy cheeses?
- The people in the hot air
balloon fought back.

and a shoe.

It was more convenient
for the trashmen but less
convenient for me and Randy.

that are easy become habit,

Since Randy was the one

he agreed to take his letter
back, while me and Catalina
