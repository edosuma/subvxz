00:06.555 --> 00:09.422
I couldn't look back again.
I just couldn't do it.

00:09.423 --> 00:12.326
I didn't want to see that face.

00:12.327 --> 00:17.690
If it was a normal imaginary friend like a
rabbit or something, I could handle it.

00:17.691 --> 00:23.437
Here's a guy that looks like he
was attacked by a chain saw.

00:23.438 --> 00:27.274
I had no control over it, like
something put me in a spell.

00:27.275 --> 00:30.311
Okay, I'm going to go there, like I was
a zombie and I was gonna walk there.

00:30.312 --> 00:31.140
[Truck honks]

00:31.141 --> 00:33.295
And that's how it felt.

00:33.296 --> 00:36.751
I had a feeling she was behind me.
I didn't want to look.

[Upbeat music]

01:10.385 --> 01:13.585
I was about 16 years old.

01:13.586 --> 01:15.456
I was in high school, of course.

01:15.457 --> 01:19.835
And during the summer, I worked at the
University of Southern California.

01:19.836 --> 01:23.364
And that's where I met my friend Alain.

01:23.365 --> 01:25.874
Alain was like an older
brother that I could talk to,

01:25.875 --> 01:28.375
and kid around with and make fun of.

01:28.376 --> 01:30.171
And he did the same with me.

01:30.172 --> 01:32.039
- You're silly.
- No.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.880
Back in 1988, I was a
20-year-old college student.

01:35.881 --> 01:38.905
Tina was the baby of our group of friends.

01:38.906 --> 01:44.806
I pretty much was entrusted with
Tina's safety through the evening.

01:45.096 --> 01:47.956
I had met Alain in college
in my freshman year.

01:47.957 --> 01:50.837
[Drumsticks tapping]

01:50.984 --> 01:52.904
- We were almost like brothers-in-arms.
- Hey.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.713
We were both pretty goofy...

01:55.714 --> 01:58.507
Just enjoyed getting into whatever
mischief that we could get into.

01:58.508 --> 02:00.852
So, guys, what are we gonna do now?

02:00.853 --> 02:04.248
As any other young college boy,
I was into chasing girls.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.297
[Chuckles]

02:05.298 --> 02:07.418
Tina was kind of a little
cutie-pie back then.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.603
Any ideas?

02:09.604 --> 02:12.179
Al I'd known from high school.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.696
We had been friends since tenth grade.

02:14.697 --> 02:16.807
We were at Dodger Stadium.

02:16.808 --> 02:20.821
The game had ended, and the
night was still young.

02:20.822 --> 02:22.389
I don't want to go home yet.

02:22.390 --> 02:24.055
Exactly.

02:24.056 --> 02:26.728
Tina was pretty young, so we
were fairly limited as far,

02:26.729 --> 02:28.462
as where we could all go as a group.

02:28.463 --> 02:30.997
I have an idea.

02:30.998 --> 02:33.914
I say we hop back in the cars, go uptown...

02:33.915 --> 02:37.804
Hop the fence, go up the slope,
and touch the Hollywood sign.

02:37.805 --> 02:42.142
Brian had suggested, hey, let's go to the
Hollywood sign, see how far we can go.

02:42.143 --> 02:43.878
And maybe touch the letters.

02:43.879 --> 02:45.106
[Laughter]

02:45.107 --> 02:48.210
- Tina?
- Come on, Tina.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.271
Tina, Tina.

02:49.272 --> 02:52.052
When you're that age, you always want
to do something you're not supposed to

02:52.053 --> 02:53.153
and be a little bit naughty.

02:53.154 --> 02:54.989
Tina, Tina.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.340
- Tina.
- Okay, I'm down.

02:56.341 --> 02:58.130
- All right.
- Let's go, man.

02:58.131 --> 03:00.812
Alain is very by the rules.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.597
And he doesn't like breaking the rules.

03:03.598 --> 03:05.399
Come on, it sounds fun.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.431
[Grunts]

03:06.432 --> 03:10.570
It wasn't something that
we should be doing.

03:10.571 --> 03:13.469
That night, none of us
expected to experience

03:13.470 --> 03:16.777
anything so terrifying beyond belief.

[Ominous music]

03:20.542 --> 03:23.002
[Siren wails]

03:23.500 --> 03:26.400
We jump in the cars, going down Sunset.

03:26.401 --> 03:29.461
It was just a blast.

03:30.091 --> 03:32.859
I rode with Alain across town.

03:32.860 --> 03:35.495
It was exciting.
I mean, it was just something new.

03:35.496 --> 03:38.616
[Upbeat hip-hop music]

03:38.633 --> 03:40.052
We'd all grown up around this sign.

03:40.053 --> 03:44.972
Every time you looked up from wherever
you were in the city, you see it.

03:44.973 --> 03:46.540
It's like this mecca.

[Suspenseful music]

03:51.179 --> 03:53.879
[Bridge rattling]

03:58.219 --> 04:04.119
As we got up to the top of a hill,
I didn't know where Al was going.

04:07.862 --> 04:12.266
But it was a cul-de-sac,
kind of a dead end.

04:12.267 --> 04:15.867
I found a way in over here.

04:18.206 --> 04:19.802
[Drumsticks tap]

04:19.803 --> 04:23.235
And there was this chain-link fence.
And that's all that's separating us,

04:23.236 --> 04:25.045
and this great Hollywood landmark.

04:25.046 --> 04:28.032
Uh, hey, guys, you think
this is such a great idea?

04:28.033 --> 04:31.352
And it said no trespassing very clearly.

04:31.353 --> 04:33.854
Alain was a little apprehensive.

04:33.855 --> 04:36.490
Oh, come on, Alain, who cares?

04:36.491 --> 04:39.491
Let's just do this.

04:39.494 --> 04:41.084
We knew that what we were doing was wrong,

04:41.085 --> 04:44.865
but that's what made it so
much fun and so enticing.

04:44.866 --> 04:46.967
We jumped the fence.

04:46.968 --> 04:49.036
There you go, man.

04:49.037 --> 04:50.904
[Grunts]

04:50.905 --> 04:53.573
- All right, Tina, your turn.
- I'm afraid of heights.

04:53.574 --> 04:57.077
I can't do it. It's too high.

04:57.078 --> 04:59.480
Hey, Tina, come over here.

04:59.481 --> 05:00.428
[Both grunting]

05:00.429 --> 05:03.965
We kind of pulled the
fence open a little bit.

05:03.966 --> 05:08.500
At that point, I really was
determined to get through the gate.

05:08.501 --> 05:11.314
And hike up to the Hollywood sign.

05:11.315 --> 05:12.438
That wasn't so bad.

05:12.439 --> 05:16.196
We weren't supposed to be there.

05:40.388 --> 05:41.988
[Drumsticks tapping]

05:41.989 --> 05:45.769
So we just started trekking up.

05:45.860 --> 05:50.164
I myself didn't realize how steep it was.

05:50.165 --> 05:54.452
Alain would hold out his
hand and pull me up.

Like, come on, we can do it.

getting closer... We're getting closer.

[Laughs]

06:31.672 --> 06:32.405

So we finally got to the sign.
It was so exciting.

06:39.481 --> 06:41.722

It was really incredible for us to finally,
you know, be right next to something

we had grown up with and looked at all
our lives, that we see in movies,

07:03.365 --> 07:06.473
and we were finally right next to it.

to take Tina home at that point.

and brush crackling.

08:03.528 --> 08:06.130
- We were all panicking.
- Brian.

are you okay? Brian, where are you?

- Brian!
- Where are you?

I had lost my friend.

out of here and leave.

this actually is a little
bit on the dangerous side.

09:06.658 --> 09:11.535
And there's a reason that we
probably shouldn't be up here.

09:13.186 --> 09:17.474
And it became a little bit more serious.

It was getting too dangerous.

09:19.411 --> 09:25.311
We just wanted to go back down the
hill, get in our cars, and go home.

09:30.054 --> 09:33.390
All of a sudden, I see this
silhouette of a person.

09:33.391 --> 09:35.851
[Eerie music]

09:40.164 --> 09:44.339
A person, you know, coming up the path...

09:44.340 --> 09:46.680
Towards us.

09:49.475 --> 09:52.595
It was kind of weird.

09:53.338 --> 09:58.315
We were wondering, why is this
person coming up this hill alone?

09:58.316 --> 10:02.953
The closer this person got, the more
we realized that it was a woman.

10:02.954 --> 10:05.168
She was wearing a dress.

10:05.169 --> 10:08.409
Nineteen-thirty's style.

10:08.888 --> 10:11.645
She had heels on.

Which made absolutely no sense to me...

10:16.968 --> 10:20.088
A veil over her face.

10:24.108 --> 10:29.808
The way she walked seemed like
she was casually strolling.

10:30.014 --> 10:33.306
Walking effortless up the hill.

10:33.307 --> 10:34.997
Which was kind of odd.

10:34.998 --> 10:38.478
Because the hill was steep.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.794
Her footsteps made no sound.

10:43.795 --> 10:47.095
We didn't hear anything.

14:07.939 --> 14:09.690
[Engine revving]

14:09.691 --> 14:15.108
We're not even thinking about Alain and
Tina so much as we are about ourselves.

14:15.109 --> 14:18.107
I'm the youngest. I'm the slowest.

14:18.108 --> 14:21.588
The guys were ahead of me.

14:22.184 --> 14:24.233
I saw Brian and Al's car.

14:24.234 --> 14:25.326
[Engine revving]

14:25.327 --> 14:28.387
They were taking off.

14:30.814 --> 14:36.714
As soon as I got to the gate, it
was one grab for me and over.

14:40.104 --> 14:42.559
[Keys scraping]

14:42.560 --> 14:45.721
I'm fumbling with my keys.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.966
I'm struggling to get it into the ignition.

14:47.967 --> 14:50.648
I was still nervous and shaky.

14:50.649 --> 14:52.994
[Keys clicking]

14:52.995 --> 14:54.877
But I got it started.

14:54.878 --> 14:57.518
[Engine revving]

14:59.234 --> 15:00.935
I wasn't even thinking about Tina.

15:00.936 --> 15:05.569
There was so much adrenaline and
fear, I didn't want to look back.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.730
[Gasping]

15:12.593 --> 15:14.753
[Panting]

15:22.391 --> 15:24.191
Ah!

15:25.190 --> 15:27.350
[Panting]

15:29.726 --> 15:33.026
I see Alain in his car.

15:33.669 --> 15:35.589
Wait!

15:35.637 --> 15:36.738
[Screams]

15:36.739 --> 15:38.027
Don't leave me!

15:38.028 --> 15:41.109
And I'm still on the
other side of the fence.

15:41.110 --> 15:43.111
Don't leave me!

15:43.112 --> 15:45.080
[Fence rattling]

15:45.081 --> 15:47.661
[Ominous music]

15:52.588 --> 15:53.755
I didn't want to look.

15:53.756 --> 15:56.456
Don't leave me!

15:59.995 --> 16:03.115
My heart was pounding.

16:12.341 --> 16:13.621
Wait!

16:13.622 --> 16:16.322
Don't leave me!

16:16.779 --> 16:18.146
[Gasps]

16:18.147 --> 16:19.881
Wait!

16:19.882 --> 16:21.451
Wait! Wait!

16:21.452 --> 16:24.752
I was like, oh, my God.

16:25.554 --> 16:28.223
I was thinking, please, don't leave me.

16:28.224 --> 16:30.091
Wait!

16:30.092 --> 16:31.734
I hear, wait! Wait! Wait!

16:31.735 --> 16:34.362
Wait! How could you leave me?

16:34.363 --> 16:35.730
You were gonna leave me?

16:35.731 --> 16:37.365
[Gravel crunching]

16:37.366 --> 16:39.868
You were just gonna leave? You were!

16:39.869 --> 16:43.371
Tina was not just in shock but
angry that we'd all left her.

16:43.372 --> 16:47.452
You know, I felt guilty about that.

16:49.745 --> 16:52.205
[Eerie music]

16:57.586 --> 17:01.156
I had said to Al, dude,
what the hell was that?

17:01.157 --> 17:03.858
And he was like, I don't know,
just shrugged his shoulders.

17:03.859 --> 17:06.766
And we couldn't figure it out.

17:06.767 --> 17:09.287
[Somber music]

17:12.067 --> 17:14.135
None of us said the word.

17:14.136 --> 17:18.560
But we all were thinking the same thing.

17:18.561 --> 17:22.162
We'd all just seen a ghost.

17:36.624 --> 17:41.081
After I learned about the urban legend of
the lady in white, I had to learn more.

17:41.082 --> 17:44.598
You know, I wanted more
detail of who this was.

17:44.599 --> 17:49.037
Got on the Internet and what
came up was an actress...

17:49.038 --> 17:51.639
Her name was Peg Entwhistle.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.241
And as I read her story,

17:53.242 --> 17:57.078
it said she got a bad review in
a film that she'd starred in.

17:57.079 --> 17:59.881
And how she felt she had failed.

17:59.882 --> 18:04.742
In 1932, she hiked up
to the Hollywood sign...

18:10.454 --> 18:13.332
And committed suicide.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.853
[Somber music]

18:33.151 --> 18:39.051
To this day, 24 years later, her face
still haunts me like it was yesterday.

18:44.126 --> 18:46.766
[Haunting music]

18:58.507 --> 19:01.276
We moved to Yuba City in 1999.

19:01.277 --> 19:02.647
I needed fresh air.

19:02.648 --> 19:04.859
I needed to get away from
the people pollution,

19:04.860 --> 19:09.240
and the air pollution of New York City.

19:13.722 --> 19:16.357
When we first moved to the
house, it was gorgeous.

19:16.358 --> 19:20.861
It had a big garage, a big yard, so I
thought this would be a perfect place

19:20.862 --> 19:23.164
for our dog and our daughter to play.

19:23.165 --> 19:24.103
[Grunts]

19:24.104 --> 19:25.338
Look at that.

19:25.339 --> 19:27.302
Azha's the apple of my eye.

19:27.303 --> 19:30.063
She was fearless.

19:30.105 --> 19:31.605
[Car roars]

19:31.606 --> 19:35.676
My biggest concern with the house was
the fact that it was on a corner

19:35.677 --> 19:37.078
on a very busy highway.

19:37.079 --> 19:38.913
Azha.

19:38.914 --> 19:42.650
In the country on a two-lane highway,
there is really no speed limit.

19:42.651 --> 19:46.921
There wasn't too much space between
where our front porch was and the road.

19:46.922 --> 19:48.097
You can't go this far.

19:48.098 --> 19:51.559
You're gonna come as far as here and
never go that much further, okay?

19:51.560 --> 19:56.530
But it was near good schools,
and it was in a nice area.

19:56.531 --> 19:59.114
Come here, Bo. Come here, Bud.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.436
We had this dog called Bo.

20:01.437 --> 20:03.644
By then, we'd had him three years.
He was about three years old.

20:03.645 --> 20:07.041
He hardly ever barked. [Bo panting]

20:07.042 --> 20:09.502

[Bo barking]

20:12.232 --> 20:14.030
[Bo barking]

20:14.031 --> 20:17.518
All of a sudden he started this, like,
frantic barking and barking and barking.

[Bo barking]

20:18.983 --> 20:20.647
[Bo barking]

20:20.648 --> 20:23.257
He kept barking at one corner of the yard.

20:23.258 --> 20:26.094
And that corner was where the garage was.

20:26.095 --> 20:28.495
[Bo barking]

20:29.698 --> 20:32.242
Azha, come here with me.

20:32.243 --> 20:34.901
It was a warning bark, like
someone was approaching.

[Bo barking]

20:36.270 --> 20:37.844

And there was no one there.

20:41.043 --> 20:43.503
[Gate creaks]

20:44.366 --> 20:48.782
There was a fence around the yard
that was about 10 foot high.

20:48.783 --> 20:52.286
I locked the gate to this
fence with some bailing wire.

20:52.287 --> 20:56.426
I wrapped the bailing wire around
the gate about five or six times.

20:56.427 --> 20:59.693
And then I twisted it and
bent it over into a knot.

20:59.694 --> 21:02.530
To make sure he wouldn't
push the gate open.

21:02.531 --> 21:05.268
It couldn't have been more secure.

21:05.269 --> 21:07.669
[Bo barking]

21:11.073 --> 21:14.778
He wouldn't stop, like something was wrong.

21:14.779 --> 21:19.442
It just made me feel uncomfortable, a
creepy feeling I really can't describe.

21:19.443 --> 21:21.843
[Bo barking]

21:22.746 --> 21:27.888
He was barking repeatedly just at the
top of his lungs for the longest time.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.358

- Thomas!
- Yes.

a little strange in the house.

22:11.266 --> 22:14.626
[Bo yelps] [Barking stops]

22:15.602 --> 22:19.305
It was kind of a eerie
silence after all the noise.

22:19.306 --> 22:22.475
I was thinking, someone
was touching the dog

22:22.476 --> 22:27.513
because the dog wouldn't bark
if someone was touching him.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.304
All the bailing wire was there.

22:29.305 --> 22:31.337
It was still the same
knot that I put on it.

22:38.559 --> 22:41.612
He wasn't in the yard anymore.

22:41.613 --> 22:46.425
I started thinking, maybe somebody let
him out and then tied the fence back up.

22:46.426 --> 22:48.226
Bo.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.930
Usually he would come
charging if I whistled.

22:52.931 --> 22:55.151
[Whistles]

22:56.677 --> 23:00.514
And I was becoming really
frightened at this point.

Bo.

23:11.929 --> 23:14.809
Where are you, Bo?

23:18.285 --> 23:22.485
He was lying dead on the front lawn.

23:25.772 --> 23:29.023
And that's when I'd seen tire tracks.

23:29.024 --> 23:31.810
Oh, my God, he got hit by a car.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.268
I didn't hear any screeching of tires.

23:34.269 --> 23:37.539
But it appeared something made
a car veer off the road...

23:37.540 --> 23:40.240
And um, hit Bo.

knees and started crying.

23:52.299 --> 23:56.335
Azha went up to him and
put a hand on his head.

23:56.336 --> 23:59.936
She was calling him, Bo, Bo.

24:00.340 --> 24:03.876
I don't think she understood
the concept of death.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.646
I thought it was gonna be a happy
time and it was gonna be a new start

24:06.647 --> 24:11.917
and a new beginning for our family,
but it was a horrible start.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.619
And I was worried.

24:13.620 --> 24:18.663
I know that the dog didn't escape from the
pen unless he was let out by someone.

[Ominous music]

24:22.128 --> 24:24.828

24:26.966 --> 24:30.102
It was the very next day.
It was probably mid afternoon.

24:30.103 --> 24:34.294
Hey, Nick, let's talk about the
colors of the marbles, okay?

24:34.295 --> 24:36.008
This one's pink.

24:36.009 --> 24:38.243
This one's a peachy color.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.712
Can you say it?

24:39.713 --> 24:43.583
I saw my daughter having a
full conversation with...

24:43.584 --> 24:45.159
Somebody.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.985
This one's orange.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.822
But nobody was there.

Yellow.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.492
- Hey, Sweetie.
- This one...

24:53.493 --> 24:57.135
Azha didn't play with
imaginary people before.

24:57.136 --> 24:58.420
Who are we talking to?

24:58.421 --> 24:59.832
Nick.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.334
I'm playing with Nick.

25:01.335 --> 25:06.884
I found that kind of strange because
we don't know anybody named Nick.

25:06.885 --> 25:09.208
[Ominous music]

25:09.209 --> 25:14.549
The following day, I asked
her, Sweetie, who's Nick?

25:15.515 --> 25:19.655
She was a pretty good little artist.

25:29.463 --> 25:32.264
It's a mutilated body.

25:32.265 --> 25:38.165
If Nick was a normal imaginary friend like
a rabbit or something, I could handle it.

25:38.705 --> 25:44.605
Here's a guy that looks like he
was attacked by a chain saw.

25:48.248 --> 25:51.051
It was a routine for me that every
morning I went to the garage

25:51.052 --> 25:55.552
and would work out for at least an hour.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.712
Come on in, honey.

26:00.713 --> 26:04.398
And I said, Azha, why don't you come in
and sit down over here on the stool,

26:04.399 --> 26:07.072
next to me, and you can watch me work out.

26:07.073 --> 26:10.101
She just looked at me and very...

26:10.102 --> 26:14.542
Shyly just went like this with her head.

26:15.409 --> 26:18.210
Her eyes were the size of saucers.

26:18.211 --> 26:21.514
And I said, what's wrong, baby?

26:21.515 --> 26:23.144
And she told me that...

26:23.145 --> 26:27.045
There's a bad skeleton in there.

26:27.454 --> 26:30.261
A bad skeleton was the way she said it.

26:30.262 --> 26:33.382
There's nothing there.

26:33.396 --> 26:36.295
And she looked off into the
other part of the garage

26:36.296 --> 26:38.951
and slowly lifted her hand
up and pointed, no, daddy.

26:38.952 --> 26:41.292
Over there.

26:45.605 --> 26:50.225
She looked like she'd just seen the devil.

26:50.710 --> 26:56.610
She goes, the bad skeleton doesn't like
us, daddy, and it's trying to hurt us.

[Crackling]

27:01.373 --> 27:05.825
Even though my dad was there, I
didn't go inside because this thing...

27:05.826 --> 27:09.438
It felt stronger than him,
more powerful, like

27:09.439 --> 27:12.030
it wouldn't matter if he was there or not.

27:12.031 --> 27:17.336
Whatever it was in that corner
was completely terrifying.

It was about 1:00, 2:00 A.M.

27:30.350 --> 27:32.848
Everybody was in bed, sleeping.

27:32.849 --> 27:35.377

28:18.468 --> 28:20.117
It was a creepy sensation.

28:20.118 --> 28:24.654
It felt like a spiderweb
coming across my neck.

28:24.655 --> 28:30.555
I spun around to look, to see what was on
my neck, and, like, nothing on my hand.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.767
And then as I started to relax again...

28:43.274 --> 28:47.919
It felt like a hand going
across my hair on my head.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.457
And it was such a creepy feeling that it
raised the hair up on the back of my head.

28:52.458 --> 28:58.358
I've had this feeling before in Vietnam
when something bad was about to happen.

28:58.605 --> 29:03.080
Except for this now was in...
I was in America. This was in my house.

threatened for my life.

[Crying]

29:35.226 --> 29:37.386
[Screams]

29:40.298 --> 29:42.399
It was a total scream of fear.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.973
I thought that something or
somebody was hurting Azha.

29:45.974 --> 29:48.105
Azha! What's wrong?

29:48.106 --> 29:50.440
I asked her, baby, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

29:50.441 --> 29:52.546
The bad skeleton...

29:52.547 --> 29:54.270
I couldn't see bones on it.

29:54.271 --> 29:56.546
I called, whatever it was, the bad skeleton

29:56.547 --> 29:58.748
because I knew that a
skeleton is not alive.

29:58.749 --> 30:02.719
And this thing was not alive,
but it was definitely real.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.755
It was just this figure with scary eyes

30:05.756 --> 30:08.753
that were just the most
terrifying thing ever.

30:08.754 --> 30:09.925
[Crying]

30:09.926 --> 30:12.426
I would get mad and I
would cry and I would...

30:12.427 --> 30:14.798
Wail because they wouldn't believe me.

30:14.799 --> 30:19.736
No matter how hard I tried,
they would not believe me.

30:19.737 --> 30:22.973
This became a nightly occurrence.

30:22.974 --> 30:25.582
She didn't even want to sleep
alone in her bed anymore.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.344
[Whispering] It's okay. It's okay.

30:27.345 --> 30:29.595
It's upsetting to have
your kid cry every night

30:29.596 --> 30:31.348
and not be able to do anything about it.

30:31.349 --> 30:34.473
But I was telling myself, it's temporary.

30:34.474 --> 30:37.493
She's just adjusting to the change.
It'll get better.

30:37.494 --> 30:42.774
And it wasn't getting better.
It was getting worse.

30:59.110 --> 31:01.511
What the heck?

31:01.512 --> 31:04.932
My feet had dirt on them.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.717
It was kind of confusing. Look at my feet.

31:07.718 --> 31:12.155
It just seemed that everything was
getting weird at this point...

31:12.156 --> 31:17.872
The dog dying, the spiderwebs across
the back of my head, the bad skeleton.

31:17.873 --> 31:23.773
And now it's my wife, can't explain
why she's waking up with dirty feet.

31:25.225 --> 31:27.805
[Clock ticking]

31:28.039 --> 31:31.408
I was staying up late because
now I was concerned.

31:31.409 --> 31:34.292
I was waiting for Azha to start crying.

31:34.293 --> 31:38.568
I didn't want to go to sleep.
I was being hyper vigilant.

31:38.569 --> 31:41.389
[Suspenseful music]

31:48.092 --> 31:51.932
There was something in the room.

31:54.532 --> 31:57.352
[Floorboards creak]

32:09.721 --> 32:12.182
[Latch clicks]

32:12.183 --> 32:17.163
I hear the latch to the
front door click open.

32:22.660 --> 32:25.660
[Floorboards creaking]

32:27.283 --> 32:29.203
Yuma?

32:35.137 --> 32:38.617
Her eyes were open, but she
didn't say anything to me.

32:38.618 --> 32:42.212
And just started trying to
open the door to leave.

32:42.213 --> 32:46.173
Come on, back away from the door.

32:46.817 --> 32:50.897
I didn't remember how I got there.

32:51.238 --> 32:53.756
I remember that I heard a voice.

32:53.757 --> 32:55.576
[Ghostly whispering] Yuma.

32:55.577 --> 33:01.303
It was just very strange, like
something put me in a spell.

33:01.304 --> 33:03.600
I'm thinking... [Sighs]

33:03.601 --> 33:06.011
Maybe, you know, Azha is right.

33:06.012 --> 33:11.912
Maybe there is a bad skeleton here,
and maybe it is trying to hurt us.

33:17.178 --> 33:19.245
There was one night when
it all came to a head.

33:19.246 --> 33:21.826
[Clock ticking]

33:26.967 --> 33:29.607
[Water plopping]

33:33.841 --> 33:36.541
[Water splashing]

33:38.512 --> 33:41.092
[Ominous music]

33:45.753 --> 33:48.721
[Distorted whispering]

33:48.722 --> 33:51.362
[Whispers] Yuma.

33:51.627 --> 33:55.241
This voice was calling me.
And it was telling me, come to the water.

33:55.242 --> 33:58.062
[Distorted barking]

34:04.457 --> 34:10.129
Across the street, across that big
highway, is a treacherous river.

34:10.130 --> 34:12.397
I felt like I needed to get into the river.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.665
[Water bubbling]

34:13.666 --> 34:19.565
I had no control over it, like I
was in a trance or something.

34:19.772 --> 34:22.351
[Woman screams]

34:29.869 --> 34:32.449
[Ominous music]

34:32.503 --> 34:36.676
I remember the voice drawing me
and calling me to the water.

34:36.677 --> 34:39.556
Come in the water.

34:41.078 --> 34:46.978
Come into the water to be with me.
Come with me to the water.

34:48.085 --> 34:52.165
[Distorted voice] Come to the water.

34:52.634 --> 34:56.414
It was a very intense feeling...

34:58.726 --> 35:02.506
Like I had no control over it.

35:05.098 --> 35:07.858
[Vehicles roaring]

35:16.914 --> 35:19.554
[Engine revving]

35:19.985 --> 35:22.565
[Ominous music]

35:23.353 --> 35:25.548
I wasn't afraid of the river.
I wasn't afraid of the water.

35:25.549 --> 35:28.824
I wasn't afraid of the
voice that was calling me.

35:28.825 --> 35:31.528
[Distorted voice] Come to the water.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.929
It felt safe.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.464
[Cars roaring]

35:34.465 --> 35:36.865
[Horn honks]

35:40.504 --> 35:43.540
Okay, I'm going to go there, like I was
a zombie and I was gonna walk there.

35:43.541 --> 35:46.704
And that's how it felt.

35:46.705 --> 35:49.525
[Suspenseful music]

35:50.781 --> 35:54.279
I was so ready to go under the
water and go in the water

35:54.280 --> 35:56.343
wherever this thing was telling me to go.

35:56.344 --> 35:58.984
[Water bubbling]

36:07.918 --> 36:10.318
[Horn honks]

36:16.693 --> 36:17.740
[Horn honking]

36:17.741 --> 36:20.643
[Brakes screeching and horn honking]

36:20.644 --> 36:23.213
Yuma was not in the bed.

36:23.214 --> 36:25.281
My heart was pounding. I was scared.

36:25.282 --> 36:27.202
Yuma!

36:28.818 --> 36:32.701
Now I'm gonna lose my wife the
same way I just lost my dog...

36:32.702 --> 36:33.737
Yuma!

36:33.738 --> 36:36.858
On the stupid highway.

36:50.807 --> 36:55.478
Maybe this evil spirit or
skeleton or whatever it was,

36:55.479 --> 37:00.219
was influencing a lot
of what was happening.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.728
But there was something else
there that protected me.

37:02.729 --> 37:06.489
Something saved me from
being hit by that truck.

37:06.490 --> 37:12.070
I'm not really sure what it
was, but it was something.

37:15.499 --> 37:21.297
After that night, I saw Azha go into
the garage, like she owned the place.

37:21.298 --> 37:22.875
And this was after weeks and weeks.

37:22.876 --> 37:25.850
This was the first time that
she went into the garage.

37:25.851 --> 37:29.920
And she goes, Nick's here to
protect us from the bad skeleton.

37:29.921 --> 37:33.641
He's the good skeleton, daddy.

37:45.704 --> 37:49.725
I remember the feeling when Nick came
around that everything was okay.

37:49.726 --> 37:52.443
Like, nothing was wrong.
We didn't feel threatened anymore.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.811
I felt like I could go anywhere,
and it wasn't a problem anymore

37:54.812 --> 37:59.217
because the bad skeleton
wasn't in there anymore.

37:59.218 --> 38:04.555
She told me that the good skeleton
ran the bad skeleton off.

38:04.556 --> 38:07.825
I don't know where it went,
but it was only Nick now.

38:07.826 --> 38:12.030
She would just start talking to
Nick, like he was an old friend.

38:12.031 --> 38:14.499
He had his motorcycle that he
was working on all the time.

38:14.500 --> 38:20.271
He was always cleaning it, always
fixing it, always tuning it up.

38:20.272 --> 38:22.973
After that, there was a
big change in the house.

38:22.974 --> 38:25.510
Azha wasn't having nightmares anymore.

38:25.511 --> 38:28.179
Yuma stopped the sleepwalking.

38:28.180 --> 38:32.283
I was just happy that everything was
calm again and almost back to normal,

38:32.284 --> 38:36.244
except for Nick the good skeleton.

38:41.160 --> 38:47.060
But then our neighbors Barbara and George
told us the most extraordinary thing.

38:48.967 --> 38:51.926
Barbara asked me if Azha was
still having the night terrors.

38:51.927 --> 38:53.271
And I told her no.

38:53.272 --> 38:55.639
Now she talks about this guy named Nick.

38:55.640 --> 38:58.909
He's always fixing his
motorcycle in the garage.

38:58.910 --> 39:02.380
She said, well, that's really funny
because years and years ago...

39:02.381 --> 39:07.552
We used to have a neighbor named
Nicholas who rode a motorcycle.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.013
[Eerie music]

39:10.789 --> 39:12.723
My whole body just went cold.

39:12.724 --> 39:16.349
Like, my feet were cold,
and I felt kind of sick.

39:16.350 --> 39:20.664
According to Barbara, Nick
actually lived in this house.

39:20.665 --> 39:23.033
And he was a motorcycle enthusiast.

39:23.034 --> 39:25.734
[Engine clicking]

39:25.804 --> 39:27.394
Coming home one day...

39:27.395 --> 39:30.035
[Engine revving]

39:30.342 --> 39:33.599
Nick had been involved in
a motorcycle accident.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.447
He had rear-ended a tractor trailer.

39:36.448 --> 39:40.884
Right at the very spot where
the dog was hit by a car.

39:40.885 --> 39:45.490
It was the same spot where Yuma was almost
run down and sleepwalking that night.

39:45.491 --> 39:46.494
[Horn honking]

39:46.495 --> 39:51.895
He was very badly mangled
and that he died instantly.

39:52.046 --> 39:55.723
When old man George told
me this, it was like...

39:55.724 --> 39:58.365
Sonny Liston hit me a
right cross in the jaw.

39:58.366 --> 40:01.486
It was a total shock.

40:02.016 --> 40:06.909
It was like everything just
came together like a puzzle.

40:06.910 --> 40:08.802
Whether he's good or bad,
that's not the point.

40:08.803 --> 40:13.272
The point is that there is a
spirit that's at unrest...

40:13.273 --> 40:14.870
Haunting my daughter.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.691
[Suspenseful music]

40:33.655 --> 40:36.623
We told Azha that we're going to help Nick.

40:36.624 --> 40:42.524
Because he's in a dark place and he's cold
and she's suffering where he is right now.

40:42.978 --> 40:44.961
I am half Vietnamese.

40:44.962 --> 40:50.102
The Vietnamese believe more in the
spirit world than most American's do.

40:50.103 --> 40:52.641
My Mother is full blooded Vietnamese.

40:52.642 --> 40:55.813
She said don't worry just
relax we'll do a ceremony.

40:55.814 --> 40:59.978
I thanked Nick very profusely
for protecting my family.

40:59.979 --> 41:03.879
But now it was time to move on.

41:07.477 --> 41:10.649
It was a heartbreaking feeling
to know that my daughter,

41:10.650 --> 41:15.810
was losing a friend that
she cared so much about.

41:18.946 --> 41:23.146
I remember wanting to find him there.

41:26.363 --> 41:29.215
I looked where he was with his
motorcycle all the time, where he slept,

41:29.216 --> 41:31.996
where he stayed, where he usually was
I could always find him there before.

41:31.997 --> 41:35.297
He wasn't there anymore.

41:36.070 --> 41:38.350
Just gone.

41:40.156 --> 41:44.129
I couldn't even feel him not even
remnants that he used to be there.

41:44.130 --> 41:48.150
I just couldn't sense him anymore.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.797
Nick is gone.

41:55.027 --> 41:59.770
I never thought in a million years that I
would have dealings with the spirit world.

41:59.771 --> 42:04.931
Ghost and ghouls to me...
Were Halloween fantasy's.

42:06.036 --> 42:09.344
I still think about Nick, I miss him still.

42:09.345 --> 42:11.666
He was my friend, he was my companion.

42:11.667 --> 42:15.885
I was fond of him, he was like
a bigger older brother to me.
