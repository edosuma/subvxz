<i>Okay!
Harder! Harder! Don't stop!</i>

00:08.179 --> 00:10.046
<i>Don't ever stop! Keep going!</i>

00:10.080 --> 00:12.081
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

00:12.116 --> 00:16.018
<i>This ain't some fancy workou,
girls, and it sure ain't yoga.</i>

00:16.053 --> 00:18.421
<i>My workout will get you in shape.</i>

00:18.456 --> 00:20.423
<i>You'll become a fighting machine.</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:24.427
<i>You work out with me, and I'l
turn you into one tough broad.</i>

00:24.462 --> 00:26.729
<i>We're doing it all here.
Come on. Work out.</i>

00:26.764 --> 00:29.766
<i>See her form?
See what she's doing? Yes! Yes!</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:32.368
<i>You are one tough broad!</i>

01:00.931 --> 01:02.365
Enough already.

01:04.301 --> 01:05.935
You're only gonna be gone
for three days.

01:05.970 --> 01:08.438
You're pregnant.
You're vitamin-ing for two.

01:08.506 --> 01:12.442
Do we need to revisit the pictures
of the iron-deficient spleen?

01:12.510 --> 01:15.178
I'm so excited for your
medical examiner's convention.

01:15.246 --> 01:18.047
Is there anything I can do that
will help you get out the door?

01:18.082 --> 01:22.018
- Take your pyridoxine.
- Is it the one that looks

01:22.019 --> 01:25.889
like Fred Flintstone
or Barney Rubble?

01:29.460 --> 01:33.229
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:33.264 --> 01:36.433
Mwah!
But I'm excited I'm gonna get

01:36.434 --> 01:40.503
to spend some one-on-one
time with Jane.

01:44.528 --> 01:47.296
So, there will be
a temporary fill-in M.E.

01:47.364 --> 01:49.298
And Susie will be available
at the crime lab.

01:49.366 --> 01:51.300
And, of course,
I'm always available by phone.

01:51.335 --> 01:54.404
- Day or night.
- Everything is gonna be fine.

01:54.438 --> 01:56.572
Yeah, but, I mean, I don't know.

01:56.607 --> 01:58.708
What if something goes wrong
with the house?

01:58.742 --> 02:01.644
Or we have another big case?
Maybe I should just stay.

02:01.679 --> 02:03.146
I thought you were really
looking forward to this.

02:03.180 --> 02:06.049
I was.

02:07.551 --> 02:09.018
But ...?

02:12.756 --> 02:15.324
Graywoods casino.

02:15.359 --> 02:19.295
- Food by Wolfgang Puck.
- Oh.

02:19.363 --> 02:21.464
- Table magic by David Blaine.
- What?

02:21.532 --> 02:23.066
Sounds incredibly awesome.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.502
I know.
Way better than my convention.

02:26.537 --> 02:29.405
What? The one you hosted?
It was a big hit.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.376
Yeah, but it just wasn't... fun.

02:33.444 --> 02:37.747
Well, medical-examiner conventions
aren't supposed to be fun.

02:37.815 --> 02:39.682
That's not the point. They're
supposed to be educational.

02:39.717 --> 02:41.684
Oh!

02:41.719 --> 02:43.386
Andrea Bocelli.

02:43.420 --> 02:47.390
Double hubba-hubba.

02:47.424 --> 02:48.791
Ooh!

02:48.826 --> 02:51.160
I'm marrying you off
before Maura gets back.

02:51.195 --> 02:53.029
Good luck.

02:55.599 --> 02:59.569
- Rizzoli.
- Isles. Yes. I'll be right out.

02:59.603 --> 03:01.571
Okay. I'm on my way.

03:01.605 --> 03:03.272
- Cab.
- Homicide.

03:03.307 --> 03:04.574
Ohh!

03:04.608 --> 03:08.711
- Maybe I should stay.
- Go to the convention. Save a life.

03:11.315 --> 03:14.417
Okay, we're walking.
We're moving. We're going.

03:14.451 --> 03:16.385
See. You're having fun already.

03:49.386 --> 03:52.622
- Sergeant Korsak.
- Morning, Jenkins.

03:52.656 --> 03:54.457
Guy just left this for you.
Bobby Symanski.

03:57.227 --> 03:58.728
Korsak.

03:58.796 --> 04:01.364
I'll be right there.

04:07.504 --> 04:11.641
- Hey.
- Hey. The temp M.E. is on his way.

04:11.675 --> 04:14.377
Deceased is Judith Barnett, 40.

04:14.411 --> 04:16.345
Multiple stab wounds on her back.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.480
Weapon?

04:17.514 --> 04:19.248
Uh...

04:19.283 --> 04:20.716
<i>Two round blood smears
on either side of her,</i>

04:20.750 --> 04:24.687
- so the killer was kneeling over her.
- No sign of forced entry.

04:24.755 --> 04:27.356
Neighbor saw a white truck
gunning away from the curb.

04:27.391 --> 04:31.127
- License plate?
- No. And no description of the driver.

04:31.161 --> 04:34.263
Neighbor saw the open door,
came in, found the body, called 911.

04:34.298 --> 04:35.565
What about relatives?

04:35.599 --> 04:37.600
The victim's husband,
Alan, is a dentist.

04:37.634 --> 04:40.870
He's been with a patient, in surgery.
Here's the address.

04:41.904 --> 04:44.841
All right.
Let us know what you turn up.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.543
We'll go talk to Alan.

04:52.549 --> 04:56.252
<i>Dr. Barnett should be
finished any moment.</i>

04:56.286 --> 04:58.554
Are you sure I can't
help you, detectives?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.256
Uh, no, thank you.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.592
We really do need to
speak to Dr. Barnett.

05:04.328 --> 05:05.895
Here you go, sweetie. Thanks.

05:05.929 --> 05:07.196
See you tomorrow.

05:07.231 --> 05:08.664
<i>Oh, here he is.</i>

05:08.699 --> 05:11.934
You have someone coming
to pick you up, right?

05:11.969 --> 05:14.904
- My son... Sam.
- Excellent.

05:14.938 --> 05:16.906
Very good driver, Sam.

05:16.940 --> 05:21.277
I'm sure.
Good to see you, Marion.

05:21.311 --> 05:25.181
Dr. Barnett.
These detectives from the Boston police

05:25.249 --> 05:26.616
would like to speak with you.

05:26.650 --> 05:29.352
Oh. Really? Why?

05:29.386 --> 05:32.388
What time did you leave
the house this morning?

05:32.422 --> 05:35.191
6:15. Judith was asleep.

05:35.225 --> 05:37.727
I met Mrs. Gold here at 6:30.

05:37.761 --> 05:41.831
- And your receptionist can confirm that?
- What?

05:41.899 --> 05:43.799
No. She comes in at 8:00.

05:44.935 --> 05:47.803
I was alone with Mrs.
Gold for the gum graft.

05:47.838 --> 05:49.672
She needs extra attention.

05:51.308 --> 05:53.809
I told Judith that
something like this might happend.

05:53.844 --> 05:58.547
- What do you mean?
- Judith was big all her life...

05:58.582 --> 06:01.817
as a girl, when I met
her, when we got married.

06:01.852 --> 06:05.187
And I loved her.
Just the way she was.

06:05.222 --> 06:08.524
But she didn't love herself.
She tried dieting. Never worked.

06:08.592 --> 06:10.526
Then, a year ago, she found tough broad.

06:10.594 --> 06:13.796
- The workout.
- She lost a hundred pounds.

06:13.864 --> 06:18.200
- And I was really worried for her.
- Could explain that for us?

06:18.268 --> 06:21.070
She was a grown woman who'd
never learned how to deal

06:21.071 --> 06:23.873
with men's advances because
no one was ever interested.

06:23.941 --> 06:28.311
<i>Most woman develop some kind
of defenses as teenagers.</i>

06:28.345 --> 06:30.613
Judith was getting a lot
of attention from men.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.002
She didn't know how to handle it.

06:34.952 --> 06:37.286
Excuse me.

06:38.755 --> 06:40.389
Frankie.

06:40.424 --> 06:42.325
Was there a specific man
giving your wife attention?

06:42.392 --> 06:44.860
No, but...

06:44.895 --> 06:48.464
Guys were starting conversations
with her in the supermarket.

06:48.498 --> 06:52.802
Waiters were fawning over her.
The mailman hung around to chat.

06:52.836 --> 06:53.936
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

06:53.971 --> 06:57.840
- Did that bother you?
- Me? No.

06:57.874 --> 07:00.610
I was proud.

07:01.645 --> 07:04.880
I was the guy with this amazing wife.

07:06.817 --> 07:10.252
Was Judith expecting anyone
at your house this morning?

07:10.287 --> 07:16.325
Our handyman.
He's been putting in new insulation.

07:16.393 --> 07:19.395
- And what is his name?
- Luis Benitez.

07:21.965 --> 07:24.433
We'll be in touch, Dr. Barnett.

07:24.468 --> 07:27.146
We are very sorry for your loss.

07:34.978 --> 07:36.946
- What's up?
- That call from Frankie.

07:36.980 --> 07:39.281
They found the knife
used to stab Judith.

07:39.316 --> 07:41.684
It's got the initials "L.B."
carved into the handle.

07:41.718 --> 07:44.520
Let's have some uniforms bring
Luis Benitez in for a chat.

07:44.554 --> 07:46.489
Let's.

07:46.556 --> 07:48.657
He's got a long rap sheet.

07:48.725 --> 07:50.593
Multiple arrests for
breaking and entering.

07:50.627 --> 07:52.695
<i>Multiple incidents of
assault with a deadly weapon.</i>

07:52.763 --> 07:57.333
- Wild guess on the weapon... a knife?
- Wild and correct.

07:58.368 --> 07:59.568
Korsak.

07:59.603 --> 08:01.337
He did so much work for the Barnetts,

08:01.371 --> 08:05.007
they set up an account for
him at factory hill hardware.

08:05.042 --> 08:07.977
He bought locks a month ago.
So he'd have a key.

08:08.011 --> 08:09.612
Could this get any easier?

08:09.646 --> 08:13.315
When the uniforms went to
pick up Luis, he was gone.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.752
His mother said he went out of town...
took some clothes, left in a hurry.

08:16.787 --> 08:20.430
So our guy's not ready to
jump into cuffs just yet.

08:28.219 --> 08:30.454
- What's up, Chang?
- Jane!

08:30.521 --> 08:33.557
Uh, Dr. Crosby gave me the initial
findings from the crime scene.

08:33.624 --> 08:36.626
- Well, why didn't he give them to me?
- Oh, there's a reason

08:36.660 --> 08:38.462
why he works in a
one-man office in Maine.

08:41.791 --> 08:46.336
Anyhoo...
these are Judith's wounds.

08:46.404 --> 08:48.338
The length and the shape of
the knife found at the scene

08:48.372 --> 08:51.408
match the wound pattern.
The edges were serrated,

08:51.442 --> 08:54.411
which is why ribs were
broken and bone was sawed off.

08:54.479 --> 08:57.748
- What about the blood on the knife?
- Matches the victim.

08:57.782 --> 08:59.449
No fibers or hair on the
body that weren't hers.

08:59.484 --> 09:02.052
So you think the killer snuck
up behind her and stabbed her?

09:02.086 --> 09:04.454
- I can't say.
- Well, take a guess.

09:04.522 --> 09:07.124
- I'm a scientist.
- So's Maura. She does it.

09:07.158 --> 09:09.459
I'm not Dr. Isles.

09:09.494 --> 09:14.598
I know that, but she's not here.
So, throw out a theory.

09:14.632 --> 09:15.966
Stretch your wings and grow.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.234
It's your time to shine. Whoo!

09:17.301 --> 09:20.237
That's a mixed metaphor.

09:20.271 --> 09:23.646
Okay, see. There you go.
That's very Maura.

09:36.265 --> 09:38.388
Nope. Okay.

09:38.422 --> 09:41.491

- He's good.
- Very.

10:12.223 --> 10:13.557
I like that song.

10:13.624 --> 10:16.626
His grandfather wrote it.
We used to have a band.

10:16.661 --> 10:19.162
Wow. He must be proud.

10:19.197 --> 10:21.364
<i>- ♪ come on and take a little walk... ♪

10:21.399 --> 10:22.766
I'm sorry.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.535
Oh, it's a long time ago.
Bobby dropped this off.

10:25.570 --> 10:26.837
He's playing in Boston.

10:26.871 --> 10:28.605
That's great. You gonna go see him?

10:28.639 --> 10:32.175
- He wants me to play with him.
- Vince, even better!

10:32.243 --> 10:35.312
I don't play those songs
anymore. It's not who I am.

10:35.379 --> 10:39.316
You know, in one lifetime, we
lead a lot of different lives.

10:39.383 --> 10:44.788
- Well, that one's over.
- If... you want it to be.

10:44.856 --> 10:49.559
- Tell Jane I was looking for her.
- Sure thing.

10:52.346 --> 10:54.914
<i>Luis was an almost constant presence
at the house the last year.</i>

10:54.949 --> 10:57.650
So he witnessed Judith's
total transformation.

10:57.685 --> 11:01.221
<i>- Hi!
- Hold on.</i>

11:01.288 --> 11:04.624
<i>- No more shots for Carla.
- I'm not driving!</i>

11:04.658 --> 11:07.627
<i>- More shots for Carla!
- Whoo!</i>

11:07.695 --> 11:08.895
<i>Continue.</i>

11:08.963 --> 11:10.864
Well, they spent a lot of time together.

11:10.898 --> 11:14.351
Uh, maybe that allowed Luis
to think there was something

11:14.352 --> 11:17.804
more going on than her
just being nice.

11:17.838 --> 11:20.340
<i>What is going on in your room?</i>

11:20.374 --> 11:23.843
I've turned it into a hospitality suite
with an open bar.

11:24.912 --> 11:27.280
Ah! Good job, Gary!

11:27.314 --> 11:30.950
- He hit the bull's-eye.
- Great.

11:30.985 --> 11:36.256
<i>- Well, it looks like you're having fun.
- Jane, it's a nightmare.</i>

11:36.290 --> 11:39.392
<i>Carla is out of control,
and they've wrecked my room.</i>

11:39.427 --> 11:41.494
<i>And now they think I'm
this crazy party person.</i>

11:41.529 --> 11:44.064
You're not?

11:44.098 --> 11:45.732
Look, don't do anything

11:45.766 --> 11:47.634
that makes you uncomfortable,
all right? Just be yourself.

11:47.701 --> 11:50.370
Right. Absolutely. Good advice.

11:50.404 --> 11:52.906
<i>Dr. Isles!
We're dry over her!</i>

11:52.940 --> 11:55.508
<i>Well, give me that bottle of rye,</i>

11:55.576 --> 11:59.079
<i>and I'll show you how to
make a Dr. Pecker!</i>

11:59.113 --> 12:01.481
Hey, Frankie.

12:03.617 --> 12:06.586
Uniforms spotted Luis'
car in the South end.

12:06.620 --> 12:08.721
Okay. Where are you?

12:08.756 --> 12:11.424
In an alleyway near the
corner of Mass and Columbus.

12:14.028 --> 12:16.357
<i>There he is, Jane. I gotta go.</i>

12:19.967 --> 12:23.069
He's coming out the back.
Move. Move!

12:28.476 --> 12:30.577
Freeze! Boston police!

12:30.611 --> 12:32.011
Put your hands on the car.

12:34.048 --> 12:36.229
Get your hands on the car!

12:51.398 --> 12:52.966
Okay! Ow! Okay!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.534
Didn't you learn anything

12:54.602 --> 12:56.636
the last time you got
arrested, Luis? Don't run.

12:56.670 --> 12:57.904
Makes you look guilty.

12:57.938 --> 12:59.606
<i>No, I'm innocent, man!</i>

13:02.042 --> 13:05.612
Tell us what happened yesterday morning.

13:08.616 --> 13:11.985
I showed up for work at the Barnetts'.
I knocked on the door.

13:12.019 --> 13:13.853
No one answered. So I used my key.

13:13.921 --> 13:17.924
I walked around, and
I found Mrs. Barnett.

13:19.593 --> 13:22.595
- But I didn't do it.
- Then why did you run?

13:24.064 --> 13:28.034
Because I've got a record.
Because I know how it looks.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.869
'Cause no one believes an ex-con.

13:29.903 --> 13:31.704
Do you have your initials
on all your tools?

13:31.739 --> 13:34.474
No, just my knife.

13:34.508 --> 13:39.712
To remind me that what's used for evil
can also be used for good.

13:39.747 --> 13:41.080
And where is that knife now?

13:41.148 --> 13:43.616
I don't know. I can't find it.

13:43.651 --> 13:45.785
You've got multiple priors for robbery,

13:45.819 --> 13:48.888
Breaking and entering,
three separate stabbings.

13:48.922 --> 13:51.190
<i>All that time in
the house with Judith.</i>

13:51.225 --> 13:54.709
You must have thought
that could go somewhere.

13:55.829 --> 13:58.965
So you made a move on her.
And when she refused, you got mad.

14:01.535 --> 14:04.203
- That could have happened.
- It did happen.

14:04.238 --> 14:07.307
No. But it could have.

14:09.209 --> 14:11.244
I had no self-control.

14:11.312 --> 14:13.012
When I got out of prison the last time,

14:13.047 --> 14:15.748
even moms told me she
wasn't gonna be there for me,

14:15.783 --> 14:21.954
that I had shamed her, that I...
that I had shamed god.

14:21.989 --> 14:24.157
And I heard her.

14:24.191 --> 14:27.193
I went back to our
church. I went to A.A.

14:27.227 --> 14:28.928
Moms gave me my room back,

14:28.962 --> 14:31.164
and I moved in so she
could see I was trying.

14:36.003 --> 14:39.105
And I changed.

14:41.008 --> 14:45.411
Well, Judith was changing, too.
That must have been attractive to you.

14:45.446 --> 14:48.681
Yes.
Yes, it was.

14:48.716 --> 14:51.217
I-I...

14:51.251 --> 14:55.588
She became a different person.
S-s-she...

14:55.622 --> 14:59.659
It gave me hope.
I told her so.

14:59.693 --> 15:02.128
She inspired me.

15:05.866 --> 15:08.735
<i>Padre nuestro, que estas en el ciel.</i>

15:08.769 --> 15:11.070
_

15:24.851 --> 15:26.285
What does your gut tell you?

15:26.320 --> 15:29.221
We need evidence.

15:29.256 --> 15:31.090
He knew the victim. He was in her house.

15:31.124 --> 15:32.525
The murder weapon belonged to him.

15:32.559 --> 15:34.493
- What about motive?
- I can think of 10.

15:34.528 --> 15:36.929
Me, too, but none of them feel right.

15:36.964 --> 15:39.098
We've got no witnesses and nothing
but the knife to tie him to the murder.

15:39.132 --> 15:41.099
What do you want to do?

15:44.204 --> 15:46.272
Give me five minutes.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.887
<i>Susie!</i>

15:54.922 --> 15:57.823
I was, uh, just coming to talk to you.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.792
Oh, I'm not there. I'm here.
To show you how I shine.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.726
Okay. Great.

16:05.365 --> 16:09.101
- What's that?
- It's my theory.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.670
Your theory's in a box?

16:10.704 --> 16:13.139
It's a "die-o-rama."

16:15.008 --> 16:18.844
- Oh. D-I-E.
- Yes.

16:18.879 --> 16:22.381
- For dead people.
- Well, not all of them are dead.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.083
But it's a representation
of how they got to be.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.284
It's amazing.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.788
Yes.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.223
And the killer is wearing a Tyvek suit.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.092
Yes.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.928
Because there was no forensic evidence
found at the crime scene,

16:35.996 --> 16:39.932
which means the killer was wearing
some sort of protective outerwear.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.368
The handyman had Tyvek
suits in his truck.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.738
- Yes.
- You made all this just to tell me that?

16:45.772 --> 16:49.041
No, I made this to figure it out.
I'm a visual thinker.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.912
Well... it's fantastic.

16:52.980 --> 16:55.247
Really. Susie, thank you.
We got him.

16:55.282 --> 16:59.118
- Except the handyman didn't do it.
- Okay, but you said...

16:59.186 --> 17:01.253
The handyman's too tall
to make the stab wounds

17:01.288 --> 17:03.756
at the angle of entry they
were made on Judith's body.

17:03.790 --> 17:09.095
See, this killer is to scale,
but your suspect would not be to scale.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.363
But the Tyvek suit...

17:10.396 --> 17:12.365
He uses them a lot.
Maybe someone knew that.

17:13.398 --> 17:17.136
- You just guessed.
- I... theorized.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.238
You guessed.
No, no. You guessed.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.207
That was a guess. That was...

17:22.476 --> 17:24.810
You don't use these
things to illustrate stuff

17:24.845 --> 17:30.149
- in your personal life, right?
- Uh... okay.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.319
Wow.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.827
Luis, you spent a lot of
time at the Barnett house.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.896
Did you ever see anything unusual?

17:43.964 --> 17:47.333
Mostly Mrs. Barnett was alone.

17:47.367 --> 17:52.071
The only person that came
by was the tough broad guy.

17:52.105 --> 17:56.108
- Mickey Rizzo.
- Yeah, the boxer.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.145
He was over all the time...
private coaching.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.983
They always closed the door.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.054
We talked to Luis
Benitez's parole officer,

18:08.121 --> 18:11.023
his A.A. sponsor, his mother,
his bible-studies group.

18:11.058 --> 18:13.098
They all tell the same
story... he's a changed man.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.062
The knife wounds are
precise and deliberate.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.464
Not what you'd expect from
an ex-con with anger issues.

18:18.532 --> 18:20.466
And Susie says he's not to scale.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.101
<i>What?</i>

18:22.169 --> 18:24.804
<i>We'll talk about Susie
when you get back. Hey.</i>

18:24.838 --> 18:26.105
I think it's time we go meet the man

18:26.139 --> 18:30.984
- who turned Judith into a tough broad.
- I've got another lead to pursue.

18:31.019 --> 18:33.345
- Take Frankie.
- Sure. You okay?

18:33.380 --> 18:36.049
Great.

18:37.084 --> 18:38.551
Hey.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.352
Did you get a chance to go over
those case files I sent you?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.221
<i>Jane, you shouldnt have sent these.</i>

18:42.289 --> 18:46.058
It's a serious violation of protocol.
This is Dr. Crosby's case.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.394
<i>He's the only one authorizd
to release these files.</i>

18:48.428 --> 18:51.130
<i>Well, I didn't want to bother
him. He was too busy going slow.</i>

18:51.164 --> 18:52.598
<i>Well, this makes e very uncomfortable.</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:55.468
<i>Just take a look, please.
See if you see anything.</i>

18:55.502 --> 19:00.406
Come on, Maura! We're
playing "autopsy jeopardy!"

19:00.440 --> 19:02.408
Well, I see you've turned it
back into your kind of convention.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.844
Oh, yeah.
Last night was a bit much.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.346
Carla threw my toilet
seat out the window.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.902
<i>One game, and then we're
watching my slide show.</i>

19:11.937 --> 19:13.853
<i>Oh, no, don't do that to the...</i>

19:25.171 --> 19:27.933
- Hey, Vince!
- Hey.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.236
This thing is huge!

19:30.270 --> 19:32.371
If Maura ever kicks me out,
I'm gonna move right in.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.075
- What's that?
- My old guitar,

19:36.109 --> 19:37.676
from when I played with
Bobby's grandfather.

19:37.711 --> 19:39.145
I'm gonna give it to Bobby.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.514
That's nice. It's not what he wants.

19:41.548 --> 19:47.286
- Yeah, but it's family history.
- History is for old people.

19:47.354 --> 19:50.689
- Well, what do you think he wants?
- Come on, Vince.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.427
You're smarter than
that. Think about it.

19:55.462 --> 19:58.597
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.539
<i>How well do you know Judith Barnett?</i>

20:07.574 --> 20:09.742
Very well. She joined
the gym a year ago.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.210
Hey, what she did with her body

20:11.244 --> 20:12.678
took a lot of work and a lot of time.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.614
You gave her a lot of personal
attention, make her feel special.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.449
I mean, yeah. That's
a big part of my job.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.451
- Really?
- Look, these women...

20:19.486 --> 20:21.420
they don't get a lot of
attention from their husbands.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.389
They come here to feel
better about themselves.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.757
And if part of that's
me flirting with them,

20:24.791 --> 20:26.692
well, hey, that's good for business.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.261
- You ever go to her house?
- I set up her gym.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.130
Are we gonna find your
DNA in her bedroom?

20:31.164 --> 20:33.665
Why are you asking about DNA?

20:34.734 --> 20:38.404
Were you having an affair
with Judith Barnett?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.681
No. Look. You know
what? Judy was a client.

20:40.716 --> 20:42.574
Where were you yesterday
morning between 7:00 and 9:00?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.276
- Asleep.
- Alone?

20:44.310 --> 20:46.545
You know what?

20:46.613 --> 20:48.414
I'm not gonna answer any
more questions, all right?

20:48.448 --> 20:50.149
Okay.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.483
We're gonna need a list of
your clients and your investors.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.285
And we'll let them answer the questions.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.720
Hey, you know what? I'm the
pride of East Boston, all right?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.355
I'm golden gloves in two weight classes.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.458
- That's great, but it does...
- Hey, you know, it's taken me years

20:59.492 --> 21:01.532
to build this business and
gain these women's trust.

21:01.628 --> 21:06.264
You were alone when she was murdered.
That doesn't help you.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.902
You see how this looks, Mickey?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.414
All right, look. I wasn't alone.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.716
- What's her name?
- This could ruin me.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.385
Prison will ruin you.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.487
Look, you got it all
wrong. It's not like that.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.857
I mean, these women here,
they're all great, but...

21:31.925 --> 21:33.859
I'm gay.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.363
It would kill my business if it got out.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.959
All right. All right. It won't get out.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.802
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:43.837 --> 21:47.339
Look, Judy wasn't doing
anything with anyone.

21:47.373 --> 21:50.476
She spent all her time working out.
But this dentist, he just...

21:50.510 --> 21:51.910
I don't know. He lost interest in her.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.345
Did she talk to her husband about this?

21:53.379 --> 21:56.482
For sure, she did.
She invited him to come down here,

21:56.516 --> 21:57.916
see what this place was all
about, but he never came.

21:57.951 --> 22:00.452
You know, she thought
they'd work out together

22:00.487 --> 22:02.567
once they got the gym in
the house, but he never did.

22:02.589 --> 22:05.591
All he did was go to his
old cabin every weekend

22:05.625 --> 22:08.427
and leave a beautiful
woman at home, alone.

22:10.557 --> 22:13.465
Thanks, Mickey. We'll let you
know if we need anything else.

22:16.636 --> 22:20.906
- Well, he was doing something.
- Or someone.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.211
It's not exactly something a married man

22:52.245 --> 22:53.812
leaves out in the open
when he's cheating.

22:53.847 --> 22:56.982
One toothbrush, a can of shaving cream,

22:57.017 --> 22:59.018
a single disposable razor.

22:59.052 --> 23:02.054
No sign of another person
being here, let alone a woman.

23:02.088 --> 23:03.789
Yeah, same thing here...

23:03.857 --> 23:08.093
a couple of single-serve frozen
dinners from the trash, water bottles.

23:08.128 --> 23:11.563
He wasn't here to fish, either.
No poles, no tackle, no boat.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.099
Well, so what?
He comes up here to get away from it all

23:14.134 --> 23:16.168
and practice his dentistry skills?

23:19.072 --> 23:21.340
Something you should see outside.

23:24.711 --> 23:28.647
- Is Alan opening a fruit stand?
- It's not a great location.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.251
Better be some interesting garbage.

23:38.124 --> 23:41.093
I think it's a bullet hole.

23:41.161 --> 23:43.762
I think Alan used these
for target practice.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.077
So what? The victim was stabbed.

23:45.098 --> 23:47.032
I know it doesn't
make any sense, but...

23:47.067 --> 23:48.834
No. You're right. It's crazy.

23:48.868 --> 23:50.736
Alan's amazing wife is waiting at home

23:50.770 --> 23:52.571
and he's out here in woodlandia,

23:52.605 --> 23:54.886
playing with his dental tools
and shooting at watermelons?

23:56.242 --> 23:58.377
<i>Why? There's got to be more to it.</i>

23:59.846 --> 24:01.914
Let's get all this
back to the crime lab,

24:01.981 --> 24:04.717
- have Susie take a look at it.
- Yep.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.894
Did you find anything yet?
What's that?

24:15.929 --> 24:18.297
It's not watermelon, but
it came from inside of one.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.132
The broken watermelons all have it.

24:20.166 --> 24:23.001
Well, can you take
your best guess? Chalk?

24:23.036 --> 24:26.171
I shouldn't. I can't.

24:26.206 --> 24:29.842
<i>Jane, Susie has been
trained not to guess.</i>

24:29.876 --> 24:31.844
Really?

24:31.878 --> 24:35.147
Well, can she tell me
what made these holes?

24:35.181 --> 24:36.849
Circumferentially,
they're the same dimension

24:36.916 --> 24:38.217
as a .22-caliber bullet.

24:38.251 --> 24:40.119
<i>Jane, it took you one whole day</i>

24:40.186 --> 24:42.020
<i>to corrupt senior criminalist Chang.</i>

24:42.055 --> 24:44.423
- Pbht!
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Isles.

24:44.457 --> 24:46.425
<i>Detective Rizzoli means well,</i>

24:46.459 --> 24:50.429
<i>but you cannot let her impatience
influence your methodology.</i>

24:51.463 --> 24:55.300
<i>You forgot to activate
the cone of silence.</i>

24:55.368 --> 24:57.736
Well, can we at least talk about...

24:57.771 --> 24:59.838
<i>whatever it is you two are doing here?</i>

24:59.873 --> 25:02.374
<i>Susie's pursuing an
interesting line of inquiry,</i>

25:02.408 --> 25:04.743
<i>a forensic examination of the victims.</i>

25:04.778 --> 25:07.446
"Victims"?
What... what victims?

25:09.015 --> 25:12.651
Those aren't victims.
Those are watermelons.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.420
I am conducting a "fruit-opsy."

25:15.488 --> 25:20.759
<i>- That's funny.
- Hilarious. I'll check in later.</i>

25:21.795 --> 25:25.624
I'm going to go get a sus-ictionary.

25:25.965 --> 25:28.834
<i>There you go.</i>

25:35.842 --> 25:38.811
- Hey, Vince.
- Hey, Angela.

25:38.878 --> 25:44.216
Well, you can keep it from me, Vince,
but you can't keep it from yourself.

25:44.250 --> 25:47.352
It's a lot more complicated
than the loss of an old friend, Angela.

25:47.387 --> 25:49.121
Mm.

25:49.155 --> 25:53.926
Complications. Secrets.
Pain. Happiness.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.261
They're all the spices in the soup.

25:56.296 --> 25:59.231
You leave one out, it
doesn't taste as good.

26:05.104 --> 26:06.371
Peter & Vince.

26:09.209 --> 26:11.844
We had a meeting with an
A&R record guy from New York.

26:11.878 --> 26:14.246
He took us out on the town.
He wined us. He dined us.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.848
At the end of the night,
Peter wanted to go home.

26:15.882 --> 26:16.949
He wanted to see his wife and kid.

26:16.983 --> 26:19.818
But not me. I was flying.

26:19.853 --> 26:23.355
I didn't want that night to end.

26:23.389 --> 26:26.091
I let him walk home alone, drunk.

26:27.327 --> 26:29.261
He took a shortcut across
some railroad tracks.

26:29.329 --> 26:31.263
He fell. He hit his head.

26:31.331 --> 26:34.299
- Never woke up.
- Mm.

26:34.334 --> 26:38.991
It snowed that night.
Took a couple of days to find his body.

26:40.340 --> 26:44.877
So... how do I tell Bobby
I killed his grandfather?

26:44.911 --> 26:47.446
Oh, come on, Vince. You
know that's not true.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.914
Well, I should have...

26:48.948 --> 26:52.384
No, this is not about you, my friend.
This is about Bobby.

26:54.454 --> 26:58.490
It's about what he wants,
what only you can give him.

26:58.558 --> 27:01.927
What the hell could
I possibly give Bobby?

27:01.961 --> 27:04.463
How about a little
piece of his grandfather?

27:06.099 --> 27:09.468
Because he's still
alive here in your heart.

27:19.379 --> 27:23.181
<i>Detective Rizzoli,
I have the lab report.</i>

27:23.249 --> 27:26.351
- And another box.
- It's my findings from the fruit-opsy.

27:26.386 --> 27:30.022
They're a little hard to explain,
so I did the only logical thing.

27:30.056 --> 27:32.424
- You made another die-o-rama.
- To scale.

27:32.458 --> 27:37.029
Okay, well, Frankie said that
he thought the watermelons

27:37.063 --> 27:38.530
were being used for target practice.

27:38.598 --> 27:40.866
I agree.

27:40.900 --> 27:45.070
The bullet traveled through
and through this one.

27:45.104 --> 27:47.940
The projectile struck the
back wall of the watermelon

27:47.974 --> 27:49.308
and tore out a chunk.

27:49.375 --> 27:51.810
But in that watermelon,
the bullet didn't come out.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.212
There were no bullets
in the watermelons.

27:54.247 --> 27:55.847
Could you have missed them?

27:55.882 --> 27:58.183
Oh, no, the external
examination of the subjects

27:58.217 --> 28:00.018
showed no other means of exit.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.955
And the X-rays were negative
for any foreign bodies within.

28:02.989 --> 28:06.625
- E-except...
- Except what?

28:06.659 --> 28:09.061
- Nothing.
- Psst.

28:09.128 --> 28:10.395
Maura's not here.

28:10.430 --> 28:17.402
That stuff I found was dental plaster.
It's made from gypsum.

28:17.437 --> 28:20.472
And it was different in each watermelon.

28:20.506 --> 28:22.908
Almost as if they came
from different batches.

28:24.978 --> 28:28.380
He was trying to make a bullet
that couldn't be detected in an autopsy.

28:28.414 --> 28:32.050
- He was?
- Well, of course he was, Susie.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.919
Everyone knows the
die-o-rama doesn't lie.

28:33.987 --> 28:35.487
I'll be careful.

28:35.521 --> 28:37.189
<i>Oh, no!</i>

28:37.223 --> 28:40.192
I should have wrote "handle
with care" on that one.

28:45.180 --> 28:46.914
Alan was trying to make a
bullet out of dental plaster,

28:46.949 --> 28:49.917
something that would break apart
once it entered Judith's body.

28:49.952 --> 28:51.352
Is that even possible?

28:51.386 --> 28:53.454
Air marshals use bullets
that won't pass through a body

28:53.522 --> 28:56.224
and hurt an innocent passenger
or damage the structure of the plane.

28:58.327 --> 29:00.461
Is that Susie's die-o-rama?

29:00.496 --> 29:05.066
It's very realistic. And
to scale, and the detail...

29:05.100 --> 29:06.834
<i>Focus, Maura.</i>

29:06.869 --> 29:09.604
Well, I just think that detailed
work deserves appreciation.

29:11.507 --> 29:13.841
Okay.

29:13.876 --> 29:17.912
The plaster bullet that
did this was too hard.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.147
<i>It went all the way throug,
and it didn't break apart.</i>

29:19.181 --> 29:21.015
So he mixed and remixed the plaster.

29:21.083 --> 29:23.551
That would explain all
the broken-up watermelons

29:23.585 --> 29:26.220
- in the compost bin.
- That's right.

29:26.255 --> 29:28.589
Until he found the perfect formula.

29:28.624 --> 29:30.458
Maximum damage with no exit wound.

29:30.492 --> 29:32.226
And there'd be no ballistics.

29:32.261 --> 29:33.528
I'd like to remind everyone, again,

29:33.562 --> 29:35.830
that Judith Barnett
was stabbed to death.

29:35.898 --> 29:37.565
<i>I'm not so sure of that.</i>

29:37.599 --> 29:41.430
<i>I mean, there's something about
the nature of the knife wounds</i>

29:41.465 --> 29:42.847
<i>that's been bothering me.</i>

29:42.848 --> 29:44.922
Frankie, can you pull up the X-rays?

29:49.139 --> 29:52.942
<i>See, this wound is narrow</i>

29:52.976 --> 29:55.311
and it's not as deep as
the surrounding damage.

29:55.345 --> 29:58.014
Is that a fragment
from the dental plaster?

29:58.048 --> 30:01.150
No, according to the autopsy report,

30:01.184 --> 30:03.652
it's a bone fragment that
penetrated the pericardium.

30:03.687 --> 30:05.388
It broke off.

30:05.422 --> 30:07.256
That's what happens
when you are stabbed.

30:07.324 --> 30:11.961
<i>Yes, she was stabbed.
But the wound track here is too narrow.</i>

30:11.995 --> 30:14.530
<i>That bone fragment was not driven
into the wound by the knife.</i>

30:14.564 --> 30:18.401
Jane, I'd like Susie to examine
the bone fragments from the wounds.

30:18.468 --> 30:21.270
Okay, and I want her to test
Judith's clothes for gunshot residue.

30:21.304 --> 30:23.145
Why would he shoot her
first and then stab her?

30:23.173 --> 30:26.275
Because if Alan snuck up
on this woman with a knife

30:26.343 --> 30:28.477
and she caught him, she'd kick his ass.

30:32.449 --> 30:35.384
If Alan wanted to make
a dental-plaster bullet,

30:35.419 --> 30:37.119
he'd need two things...

30:37.154 --> 30:39.188
he'd need a gun and
something to make a cartridge.

30:39.222 --> 30:42.458
Well, the holes in the watermelons
were the size of a .22-caliber.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.193
I borrowed some from ballistics.

30:44.261 --> 30:47.325
He'd need to pull out the
lead bullet from the casing

30:47.408 --> 30:49.197
and then replace it
with the one he made.

30:49.198 --> 30:52.243
He spent a lot of time
pulling teeth with these things.

30:52.394 --> 30:56.964
I believe he could take...
a bullet out of a cartridge.

30:58.533 --> 30:59.614
Well, that was easy enough.

30:59.635 --> 31:01.168
No gun license in Massachusetts

31:01.203 --> 31:04.138
or anywhere else for Alan Barnett.
None for Judith, either.

31:04.206 --> 31:05.673
So, how the hell did he get a gun?

31:05.707 --> 31:07.541
I don't see Alan Barnett going
out and making a street buy.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.410
He didn't have to.

31:09.444 --> 31:12.146
This is a crime-scene
photo of the cabin.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.148
I had that part blown up.

31:14.182 --> 31:17.251
Young Alan Barnett had a
Ruger Bearcat, .22 caliber.

31:17.285 --> 31:18.552
Good little squirrel gun.

31:18.587 --> 31:22.223
I know Dr. Crosby
says death by stabbing.

31:22.290 --> 31:24.525
He's not Maura.

31:26.395 --> 31:29.330
- What have you got?
- Hi, Detective Rizzoli.

31:29.364 --> 31:31.284
I was just about to give
my results to Dr. Isles.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.487
Well, you have done
a wonderful job of not

31:36.488 --> 31:39.540
guessing and preserving
your scientific mythology.

31:39.574 --> 31:40.741
Thank you.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.777
<i>It's methodology, Jane.</i>

31:42.811 --> 31:48.249
<i>I say tomato, you say "tomaht-ology"</i>

31:49.584 --> 31:51.118
What have we got?
GSR on the clothes?

31:51.186 --> 31:54.388
<i>Susie, would you describe for us
what you're seeing in the microscope?</i>

31:54.456 --> 31:56.157
Yes, of course, Dr. Isles.

31:56.191 --> 31:59.026
Hmm.

31:59.061 --> 32:00.561
There are no bone-growing cells

32:00.595 --> 32:02.697
or proteins present in
these bone fragments.

32:02.731 --> 32:05.433
These bone fragments
are from cadaver bone,

32:05.467 --> 32:06.801
not your victim's ribs.

32:10.172 --> 32:11.672
The bone fragments have
to be part of the bullet

32:11.707 --> 32:15.009
- that Alan made.
- It's brilliant, really.

32:15.043 --> 32:17.545
I mean, all he had to do was
add pieces of cadaver bone

32:17.579 --> 32:20.147
to the dental plaster
before it hardened.

32:20.182 --> 32:22.283
He created the perfect delivery system.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.518
And the knife wounds were
meant to splinter the ribs

32:24.553 --> 32:26.520
to hide the cadaver
bone in the wound tracks.

32:26.555 --> 32:28.522
And to set up the handyman.

32:28.557 --> 32:31.659
Alan used Luis' knife.
He knew he had a record.

32:31.693 --> 32:33.661
It's a great plan, actually.

32:33.695 --> 32:36.630
Except for the one part
that doesn't make sense.

32:36.698 --> 32:39.500
Why would a happily
married man kill his wife

32:39.534 --> 32:41.168
after she a lost a hundred pounds?

32:41.203 --> 32:43.337
<i>'Cause he liked her
just the way she was.</i>

32:45.073 --> 32:47.113
When he was the only man
who paid her any attention.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.811
Thanks.

32:50.846 --> 32:53.514
Trace evidence section
found gunshot residue

32:53.548 --> 32:55.382
on Judith Barnett's crop top.

32:55.417 --> 32:58.149
<i>Jane, this changes everything.</i>

32:58.184 --> 33:01.721
Now I need to notify
Dr. Crosby of my findings.

33:01.755 --> 33:03.715
Although the stab wounds
are significant injuries,

33:03.757 --> 33:05.458
given what I know now,

33:05.492 --> 33:08.227
I'm revising my initial cause
of death to gunshot wound.

33:08.262 --> 33:12.365
It's time we had a
talk with Alan Barnett.

33:15.803 --> 33:18.237
Thank you for coming in.

33:18.272 --> 33:20.773
I know you must be very busy
with your wife's arrangements.

33:20.808 --> 33:23.876
Detective Rizzoli and I are
very sorry for your loss.

33:23.911 --> 33:27.863
Thank you.
It has been very hard on me.

33:27.898 --> 33:31.517
She was my friend, my partner, my lover.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.419
She was everything to me.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.123
You two must have had
a great life together...

33:37.191 --> 33:41.794
travel, restaurants,
weekends at the cabin.

33:41.829 --> 33:43.796
Did you go fishing up there?
Hiking?

33:43.831 --> 33:46.165
No. Not much.

33:47.334 --> 33:49.135
No.

33:49.169 --> 33:52.572
No, you wouldn't have.

33:52.606 --> 33:55.408
No, you'd rather watch
hiking on your TV.

33:57.745 --> 34:02.281
In your big, soft chair,
with Judith right next to you.

34:03.617 --> 34:05.251
That's what we enjoyed.

34:05.285 --> 34:07.120
Yeah, but she stopped
enjoying it, didn't she?

34:07.187 --> 34:12.391
Then she joined tough broad,
got in shape, lost the weight,

34:12.458 --> 34:14.860
and good-looking men started
paying attention to her.

34:17.730 --> 34:22.156
Big, strong men.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.525
Men like Luis and Mickey.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.831
Of course.
She looked great.

34:30.866 --> 34:32.433
And that made you happy.

34:32.467 --> 34:36.670
It made her happy.
That's what we want for our loved ones.

34:36.705 --> 34:39.739
What a generous little man you are.

34:39.774 --> 34:42.676
- Hey!
- Well, considering that your wife

34:42.710 --> 34:45.411
started a new life that you
were no longer a part of.

34:45.447 --> 34:49.617
My wife loved me.
She would never leave me.

34:49.650 --> 34:54.221
You were watching TV alone.
Going to the cabin alone.

34:54.255 --> 34:55.789
You two no longer had anything in common

34:55.824 --> 34:57.191
because she'd already left.

34:57.259 --> 34:59.493
No! I would never have allowed...

35:05.367 --> 35:07.368
Am I being placed under arrest?

35:09.437 --> 35:13.874
- You're free to go, Dr. Barnett.
- Of course I am.

35:15.610 --> 35:17.845
Because you have a
theory but no evidence.

35:17.913 --> 35:21.615
I'm not much of a
fisherman. Neither are you.

35:21.650 --> 35:25.486
You've got nothing.
And that's all you'll ever have.

35:31.526 --> 35:33.861
He thinks he's smarter than us.

35:33.895 --> 35:35.863
- Maybe he is.
- Bullshit.

35:44.439 --> 35:46.973
- Where's Frankie?
- We're meeting him in break.

35:46.974 --> 35:47.573
- You got something?
- Yeah.

35:47.608 --> 35:49.626
I had Susie take a blood
sample from the patient

35:49.627 --> 35:51.667
that Alan was with the
morning of his wife's murder.

35:51.678 --> 35:53.479
Ketamine?
The animal tranquilizer?

35:53.514 --> 35:56.416
According to Maura, dentists
use it. But an elderly patient

35:56.417 --> 35:59.318
like Mrs. Gold should be
administered a very low dose.

35:59.353 --> 36:01.763
She had a detectable level of
ketamine still in her system.

36:01.765 --> 36:04.221
48 hours after her surgery.

36:04.255 --> 36:06.223
Mrs. Gold was really out of it
of ketamiwhen we saw her.

36:06.257 --> 36:07.558
Yeah, he knocked her out

36:07.592 --> 36:08.726
and gave himself the perfect
window of opportunity.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.327
Strike one.

36:10.395 --> 36:12.629
I found the best route from
Alan's office to his house.

36:12.664 --> 36:14.698
No traffic cameras, no
homeland security cameras.

36:14.766 --> 36:15.966
15 minutes each way.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.536
Okay.

36:19.571 --> 36:22.206
So, the handyman was scheduled
to arrive at Alan's house

36:22.273 --> 36:23.907
while he was performing the gum graft.

36:23.942 --> 36:26.343
But Judith had to be
dead by then for the plan to work.

36:26.377 --> 36:28.512
But she couldn't have been
killed before he left for work

36:28.546 --> 36:29.880
or that would skew the time of death.

36:29.948 --> 36:32.216
The receptionist said
Alan was in with Mrs. Gold

36:32.250 --> 36:35.252
when she got there at 8:00.
Her appointment was 6:30.

36:35.286 --> 36:36.553
So, he worked on Mrs. Gold,

36:36.588 --> 36:38.355
made sure she was
completely anesthetized,

36:38.389 --> 36:39.389
left at 7:00?

36:40.825 --> 36:44.628
This is me on the route to his house.
He gets there at 7:15.

36:44.662 --> 36:48.332
Pulls on a Tyvek suit,
gloves and a mask,

36:48.399 --> 36:50.467
shoots Judith before
she can kick his ass,

36:50.502 --> 36:52.269
and then stabs her with the knife

36:52.303 --> 36:53.470
that he stole from the handyman.

36:53.538 --> 36:55.272
He drops the knife for us to find,

36:55.340 --> 36:58.008
takes off the Tyvek suit,
heads for the office. 7:40?

36:58.042 --> 36:59.009
Yeah, but he's still
got to get rid of the gun

36:59.043 --> 37:02.062
- and the bloody Tyvek suit.
- I had some uniforms look

37:02.063 --> 37:05.349
through all the dumpsters
and trash barrels.

37:05.416 --> 37:09.353
Public works searched the
storm drains and sewers.

37:09.420 --> 37:12.022
- Nothing.
- Yeah, he's too smart

37:12.056 --> 37:13.824
to leave anything close
to the crime scene.

37:13.858 --> 37:15.092
Mm.

37:19.864 --> 37:22.266
I know where Alan got rid of
the gun and the Tyvek suit.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.333
Strike two!

37:28.706 --> 37:29.740
Thank you.

37:31.743 --> 37:33.944
I'll take that.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.581
- You can't just...
- We called your courier service.

37:37.615 --> 37:39.082
They said you were expecting a delivery.

37:39.117 --> 37:41.985
- You have no right.
- This gives us that right.

37:44.522 --> 37:47.991
When you absolutely, positively
have to have it overnight.

37:48.026 --> 37:49.560
Which you did.

37:49.627 --> 37:52.963
Ruger, Bearcat, .22 caliber.

37:52.997 --> 37:55.599
<i>It was a slick move,
mailing yourself the only evidence</i>

37:55.667 --> 37:57.401
that'll tie you to your wife's murder.

37:57.435 --> 37:59.436
All you had to do was throw
the gun in the nearest lake

37:59.504 --> 38:00.984
and burn the Tyvek suit in the woods.

38:01.005 --> 38:05.375
- Pretty smart.
- But not smart enough. Strike three.

38:12.951 --> 38:15.352
At least I'm to scale.

38:15.420 --> 38:18.021
You are so, so not to scale.

38:18.056 --> 38:19.489
Look at those things on your chest.

38:19.524 --> 38:22.759
Those things are perfect
in form and balance.

38:22.794 --> 38:24.995
Look at you. You're all leg.

38:25.029 --> 38:26.997
Well, I'm exactly to scale

38:27.031 --> 38:28.765
because, you know, Susie doesn't guess.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.868
Well, she does now.

38:30.935 --> 38:32.135
Ooh, here she comes.

38:34.772 --> 38:37.741
Hello, senior criminalist Chang.

38:37.775 --> 38:39.743
Very nice to see you, Susie.

38:39.777 --> 38:43.747
Dr. Isles, detective. You
both look nice tonight.

38:43.781 --> 38:46.884
What? Did...
she didn't even notice.

38:46.918 --> 38:50.754
- You had your right arm up a bit more.
- I was not.

38:50.788 --> 38:53.123
You weren't... you weren't
bending your foot right.

38:53.157 --> 38:54.825
I don't bend my feet.

38:54.893 --> 38:56.426
Objects in the die-o-rama
appear bigger than they are.

38:56.461 --> 38:57.561
- Well, hers.
- Which ones?

38:57.629 --> 39:00.497
General comment.
Angela talked to you.

39:00.565 --> 39:03.967
- Yeah. That's why I'm here.
- Me too.

39:05.436 --> 39:07.571
I was thinking, when I go
to next year's convention,

39:07.605 --> 39:08.906
you should come with me.

39:08.973 --> 39:10.107
Ooh.

39:10.141 --> 39:11.408
Will they have "autopsy jeopardy!"?

39:11.442 --> 39:12.876
Yeah.

39:12.911 --> 39:14.831
Then I'm gonna schedule
surgery for that weekend.

39:16.414 --> 39:18.048
Hey, look who's back in town.

39:18.116 --> 39:19.816
Hi.

39:19.851 --> 39:22.386
- Hi. Hi, honey.
- Hi, Ma. Mwah.

39:22.420 --> 39:26.690
Hey, aren't you two a little
too old to be playing with dolls?

39:26.724 --> 39:28.045
What?
We brought them for Frankie.

39:28.993 --> 39:31.028
Oh, you're a riot, Janie.

39:31.095 --> 39:34.197
<i>Hello, Boston!
Hello.</i>

39:34.232 --> 39:37.567
Uh, tonight's a very special night.

39:37.602 --> 39:40.103
I'm gonna do some songs
my grandfather wrote,

39:40.138 --> 39:41.638
the way they were meant to be sung

39:41.706 --> 39:43.740
and the way they were
meant to be played.

39:43.775 --> 39:45.575
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Bobby.

39:45.610 --> 39:46.643
And I'm Vince.

39:46.678 --> 39:47.778
- Whoo!
- Whoo! All right.

39:47.812 --> 39:50.580
And tonight, we are Bobby & Vince.

39:50.581 --> 39:51.581
- Whoo!
- Nice!

39:52.717 --> 39:54.418
