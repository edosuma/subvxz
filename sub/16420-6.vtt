00:44.959 --> 00:47.917
- I understood the word "test."

00:47.959 --> 00:49.208

- What?

00:57.917 --> 00:59.375
Why me?

00:59.417 --> 01:01.542
- Because!

00:59.417 --> 01:01.542
Because of your new super power.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.959
- Ya, your

01:05.000 --> 01:09.542
It's called hypermotility.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.750

01:11.792 --> 01:14.000
- Okay, can we move on!?!

01:11.792 --> 01:14.000
Can we move on?

01:14.041 --> 01:17.125
- Schwoz, show him your bat.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.250
- His...his what?

01:19.291 --> 01:21.333
- You see...when you see

01:19.291 --> 01:21.333
the balls a-comin',

01:21.375 --> 01:22.959
you use this a-base-a-ball bat

01:23.000 --> 01:24.250
to swing-svat the balls.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.959
- Yep. Then Schwoz is gonna

01:26.000 --> 01:27.500
measure the speed

01:26.000 --> 01:27.500
of the base-a'balls,

01:27.542 --> 01:29.083
and then after I get hit,

01:29.125 --> 01:32.542
I tell him when my pain stops

01:29.125 --> 01:32.542
and I feel oh-kay.

01:32.583 --> 01:35.041
- And then I use

01:32.583 --> 01:35.041
a mathematical equation

01:35.083 --> 01:37.625
to determine how

01:35.083 --> 01:37.625

01:38.834 --> 01:41.000
- I just want like,

01:38.834 --> 01:41.000
five won-tons.

01:41.041 --> 01:42.959
- You can have some won-tons

01:41.041 --> 01:42.959
after we do this!

01:43.000 --> 01:46.166
- Aaaahhh!

01:43.000 --> 01:46.166
Right...

01:46.208 --> 01:47.875
- I'm gonna go stand

01:46.208 --> 01:47.875
here by the elevator.

01:47.917 --> 01:49.458
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.875
- What's that for?

01:56.917 --> 02:00.375
- To protect a-my face

01:56.917 --> 02:00.375
from stray balls.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.709

02:07.875 --> 02:11.667

02:11.709 --> 02:14.500
- It's a thermal fusion bat

02:11.709 --> 02:14.500
I made myself.

02:14.542 --> 02:17.041
- Can you make thermal

02:14.542 --> 02:17.041

03:39.834 --> 03:41.375
If I leave school for any reason

03:41.417 --> 03:42.458
I can get in huge trouble.

- C'mon...c'mon...

17:42.041 --> 17:46.417
Yeah!

17:42.041 --> 17:46.417
Pizza, right in the face.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.875
Man, I love this app.

17:53.834 --> 17:55.583
- All right, break's over.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.583
Henry, go lock the door.

18:00.125 --> 18:02.542
- Uh-oh!

18:02.583 --> 18:06.458
- Henry? Henry!

18:06.500 --> 18:08.083
- Uh, I'll lock the door!

18:08.125 --> 18:11.417
- No!

18:08.125 --> 18:11.417
I asked Henry to do it.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.166
Now Henry Hart, I asked--

18:13.208 --> 18:16.959
- Ahhhh, I think that Henry's

18:13.208 --> 18:16.959
just really focused

18:17.000 --> 18:19.250
on doing a great job

18:17.000 --> 18:19.250
on his test.

18:19.291 --> 18:23.166
Uh...right Henry?

18:23.208 --> 18:25.625
He says right.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.208
- Ah geez...

18:46.959 --> 18:49.834
- My god,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.834

18:55.208 --> 18:56.667
Hey Schwoz?

18:56.709 --> 18:58.166
TV:<i> Could you put</i>

18:56.709 --> 18:58.166

19:00.500 --> 19:01.875

19:01.917 --> 19:03.792
I sealed the gas leak,

19:03.834 --> 19:05.875
I've been stuck down here

19:03.834 --> 19:05.875
for over an hour now.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.333
- Henry didn't get there yet?

19:07.375 --> 19:09.375
- No, he's not here yet.

19:09.417 --> 19:10.875
Why would I be calling you

19:10.917 --> 19:12.709
if Henry had already

19:10.917 --> 19:12.709
been here and get me--

19:12.750 --> 19:14.125

19:34.417 --> 19:36.250

19:36.291 --> 19:38.000
who just had a Tyson drill

19:36.291 --> 19:38.000
shoved in his back.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.125
- Ah, who cares,

19:38.041 --> 19:40.125
you're indestructible.

19:40.166 --> 19:44.375
- I'm still a person,

19:40.166 --> 19:44.375

19:44.417 --> 19:45.792
- Alright, can we get going?

19:45.834 --> 19:47.792
'Cuz I really need

19:45.834 --> 19:47.792

19:47.834 --> 19:49.875

19:57.500 --> 19:58.834
- No I haven't gained weight!

19:58.875 --> 20:00.041
You're just not pulling

19:58.875 --> 20:00.041
hard enough.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.333
- I think you gained weight.

20:01.375 --> 20:02.875
- You take that back!

20:02.917 --> 20:04.417
I eat less than

20:02.917 --> 20:04.417
two thousand calories a day!

20:04.458 --> 20:05.333
- Try to suck in!

20:05.375 --> 20:07.667

20:16.083 --> 20:19.041
a leaky nuclear gas pipe

20:19.083 --> 20:21.542
was no match for

20:19.083 --> 20:21.542
Captain Man and Kid Danger.

20:21.583 --> 20:22.834
- That's right, Trent.

20:22.875 --> 20:23.917
According to city officials,

20:22.875 --> 20:23.917

Captain Man and Kid Danger

20:27.959 --> 20:30.041

20:30.083 --> 20:32.500
and the dangerous gas

20:30.083 --> 20:32.500
cloud has passed

20:32.542 --> 20:33.959
through the Swellview sky,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.917
and is now floating into

20:42.917 --> 20:45.709
wealthier man.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.959
